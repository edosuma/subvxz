I'll take care of the traitors!

10:58.866 --> 10:59.742
Traitors?

10:59.825 --> 11:00.951
Didn't we tell you?

11:01.035 --> 11:03.871
We're gonna frame you both
for sending Julien over the wall.

11:03.954 --> 11:07.166
Ow! Sorry. Intricate plotting
always makes me chatty.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.084
[growls]

11:12.046 --> 11:12.880
[grunting in pain]

11:14.507 --> 11:16.008
[grunting]

11:17.676 --> 11:20.054
[grunting]

11:20.471 --> 11:24.266
Okay, well,
seems like this is wrapping up nicely,

11:24.350 --> 11:25.851
so I'm just gonna--

11:26.519 --> 11:27.853
-[shouting]
-Whoa.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.647
[both grunt]

11:29.730 --> 11:31.148
Now, Abner! Pull!

11:31.690 --> 11:32.817
-[screams]
-[grunts]

11:32.900 --> 11:33.818
-[groans]
-Huh?

11:33.901 --> 11:36.028
[both screaming]

11:36.362 --> 11:37.822
No! [grunts]

11:37.905 --> 11:39.156
[groans]

11:41.575 --> 11:43.619
[Maurice] King Julien?
King Julien, wake up!

11:43.702 --> 11:50.126
Implants? I'll have you know, madam,
this booty is 100 percent King Julien.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.003
Wha... Maurice? Where are we?

11:53.087 --> 11:56.173
Prepare yourself. Outside the wall!

11:59.343 --> 12:03.931
Hello! Kingdom!
Are you there? It's me, King Julien!

12:04.014 --> 12:06.684
-Who goes there? Show yourself!
-[chuckles]

12:06.767 --> 12:12.273
Hector, my literally old friend,
it's King Julien and Maurice.

12:12.481 --> 12:17.903
Border's closed to outsiders.
Unless you have some ID, move along.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.321
You know who we are.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.825
Could be wearing disguises.
It's happened before.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.410
-[distant growling]
-What-the-who-that!

12:25.327 --> 12:29.206
It's them.
Those that lurk beyond the wall!

12:29.290 --> 12:30.708
They want our stuff!

12:30.833 --> 12:31.667
[rustling]

12:31.750 --> 12:33.836
Get out of here
if you know what's good for you!

12:34.795 --> 12:37.089
Maurice, hold this for me!

12:37.173 --> 12:38.340
[Julien whimpering]

12:38.466 --> 12:41.635
Why are you giving me your crown?
[gasps] Wait...

12:41.719 --> 12:44.472
You think if they see the crown,
they'll kill me first?

12:44.555 --> 12:47.391
No. [laughs nervously]

12:48.017 --> 12:48.851
Yes.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.603
You promised to sacrifice yourself for me!

12:50.686 --> 12:52.354
I never made any such promise!

12:53.105 --> 12:54.106
[both scream]

13:03.032 --> 13:04.158
[screams] Hm.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.826
[panting] Huh?

13:05.910 --> 13:08.496
Oh, sorry, did I wake you?

13:08.579 --> 13:10.122
I just wanted to give you a little spritz,

13:10.206 --> 13:12.958
but... Oh, shoot if I always overdo it.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.628
Ted, you have to let me out of here. Now!

13:15.711 --> 13:20.799
But you're a vicious enemy of the state
and as Captain of the ringtail Guard...

13:20.883 --> 13:23.886
-Captain of the... What! That's my job!
-I know!

13:23.969 --> 13:26.138
I can't wait to make you proud of me!

13:26.263 --> 13:27.765
[all murmuring]

13:27.848 --> 13:30.684
Lemurs of Madagascar, this is a dark day.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.355
Our beloved King is gone,
betrayed by the very lemur

13:34.438 --> 13:37.316
who was supposed to protect him, Clover!

13:37.399 --> 13:38.317
[all gasping]

13:38.400 --> 13:42.571
But good news,
Abner and I have everything under control.

13:42.655 --> 13:46.784
That's right, we're gonna
clean this kingdom of any more traitors!

13:46.867 --> 13:48.536
How come you guys are in charge?

13:48.619 --> 13:51.455
Why, Willie? Something to hide?

13:51.539 --> 13:53.332
Eh... [stammering]

13:53.415 --> 13:55.793
There was always something...

13:55.876 --> 13:57.169
[sipping]

13:57.253 --> 13:58.921
-squirrelly about you.
-[exclaims nervously]

13:59.004 --> 14:01.549
Always hoping we're all gonna die!

14:01.632 --> 14:05.302
I bet he's spying on us
for the outsiders right now, baby.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.597
No time to be rational.
Throw him over the wall!

14:08.681 --> 14:10.015
[Willie screaming]

14:10.099 --> 14:11.392
[all] Yeah!

14:12.643 --> 14:13.811
Yeah!

14:13.894 --> 14:15.813
This might be easier than I thought.

14:17.314 --> 14:18.816
If you are going to eat me,

14:18.899 --> 14:23.195
you should know I am ravaged by disease.
Ravaged! [coughing]

14:23.279 --> 14:26.448
Pustules! Mad Horse Disease.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.577
Uh, King Julien,
I don't think they're here to eat us.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.536
[screams]

14:30.619 --> 14:31.662
[both] Hm...

14:32.246 --> 14:34.915
Oh! Hey, you guys. [chuckles]

14:34.999 --> 14:39.003
Uh, hope you're not still mad
about the catapult thing.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.964
[laughs] We can laugh about it now. Right?

14:42.047 --> 14:44.466
'Cause it was so long ago. Oh...

14:44.550 --> 14:46.552
It was fifteen minutes ago.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.846
Really? You know, time is relative.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.639
What are you going to do to us?

14:50.973 --> 14:55.436
-We're gonna build a maze.
-We are not building a maze!

14:55.519 --> 14:56.687
Oh...

14:56.770 --> 14:58.814
Stupid, stu--

14:59.481 --> 15:02.359
The Overseer has plans for you.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.403
The Overseer?

15:05.070 --> 15:06.071
[both grunt]

15:06.906 --> 15:08.449
[thumping]

15:10.075 --> 15:11.118
[Mort giggling]

15:11.702 --> 15:12.995
-[both] Mort?
-[Maurice grunts]

15:13.078 --> 15:16.165
Hi, King Julien. Hi, Maurice.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.500
You're the Overseer?

15:18.584 --> 15:22.087
Yeah. What are you gonna do?
They saw something in me.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.132
All hail the Overseer!

15:25.215 --> 15:27.301
Thanks, guys. Take five, everybody.

15:30.095 --> 15:33.515
So glad you showed up.
I don't want to lead a revolution.

15:33.599 --> 15:37.603
The dues are outrageous.
Now King Julien can lead us!

15:38.228 --> 15:39.188
Eh...

15:40.731 --> 15:43.734
King Julien, isn't that what you want?
To get your kingdom back?

15:44.360 --> 15:46.111
I'm not so sure anymore.

15:46.195 --> 15:50.741
I allowed all this to happen.
Maybe I don't deserve my kingdom back.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.327
I need some time alone.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.705
Xixi, thank you for being here.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.374
Oh, my pleasure.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.541
When does the party start?

15:59.625 --> 16:02.795
'Cause this house ain't bangin',
this house is empty, son!

16:02.920 --> 16:04.713
[clears throat] Let's get started.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.258
Are you now,
or have you ever been, a lemur?

16:08.342 --> 16:09.510
With this beak?

16:09.635 --> 16:11.637
[laughs] Okay!

16:11.720 --> 16:12.680
Over the wall!

16:12.763 --> 16:16.308
Say what? Spring break! [screams]

16:16.392 --> 16:20.604
Maggie the Unwashed,
are you now or have you ever been a lemur?

16:21.230 --> 16:24.441
Hm. Let me consult my attorney. [farts]

16:26.026 --> 16:27.653
[grunting]

16:28.862 --> 16:30.614
[growling]

16:30.698 --> 16:33.575
Aw, gee, Clover, I'm sorry
you can't escape.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.994
Do you need to make a tinkle?

16:35.077 --> 16:37.454
Ted? Yoohoo!

16:37.538 --> 16:39.915
Lunch time. I brought quiche.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.544
Dorothy, please, you know I can't have
dairy when I'm in a confined space.

16:43.627 --> 16:47.297
Oh, hi, Clover,
I didn't see you over there.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.799
-Quiche?
-Ah.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.843
Ah, sure.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.303
-Dorothy, don't get too close to her.
-Gotcha!

16:53.387 --> 16:56.515
-[whimpers]
-Ted! Do something!

16:56.598 --> 16:59.685
You're not going to do anything
but let me out, are you, Ted?

16:59.768 --> 17:00.811
Hmm.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.438
-[Clover] Ted!
-Hold on, I'm thinking.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.190
-Ted!
-Oh, flipper doodles, fine.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.775
[sighing]

17:08.444 --> 17:09.945
[continues sighing]

17:10.821 --> 17:13.365
[Piney]  Okay, we get it, you're depressed.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.701
That voice. Could it be...

17:15.784 --> 17:19.163
Yes, Julien, it is I... Pineapple.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.458
Piney! What happened?
You look like you've been in a fight.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.625
It's nothing.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.879
Got into trouble again
with some fruits I owe money to.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.506
I'm working it out. Doing my steps.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.341
But I'm not here for me.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.720
I messed up, dude.
Fear got the best of me.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.555
I lost my kingdom, Pineapple.

17:36.638 --> 17:39.433
Nothing's lost that can't be found.

17:39.516 --> 17:43.312
Yeah, really not in the mood for any
greeting card sentiments right now.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.482
Fine. Your kingdom's where you left it.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.442
The only thing lost... is you.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.818
Hmm.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.905
Once we're over the wall,
go for the males first.

17:52.988 --> 17:56.325
The children we can sell, and the women...

17:56.408 --> 17:58.118
[evil laugh]

17:58.243 --> 17:59.745
Oh, the women...

17:59.828 --> 18:01.163
[evil laugh]

18:01.246 --> 18:04.291
...we will always treat with respect.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.209
[Julien] Stop!

18:06.335 --> 18:07.878
King Julien, you came back.

18:07.961 --> 18:12.174
Yes, as a piece of fruit with
a gambling problem once told me,

18:12.257 --> 18:14.885
I was lost, but now I'm funky.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.971
Actually, he said "found,"
but I thought that was a cliche

18:18.055 --> 18:20.099
so I put a little KJ stink on it.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.310
King Julien, I knew you'd return.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.521
Here, take my hat for good luck.

18:25.729 --> 18:29.733
[laughs] It's yours. Take it. Here!
It's... just put your fingers on it.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.693
It feels good, it's wool.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.404
-Stop, Mort, I don't need your hat!
-[Mort screams]

18:34.488 --> 18:38.826
My fellow kingdoms, I owe you an apology.

18:38.909 --> 18:43.455
Please, take a knee.
I invited you all to unite.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.873
[grunts]

18:45.165 --> 18:48.043
Yet I forgot the most important thing...

18:48.127 --> 18:52.005
when you invite guests over,
no matter how different,

18:52.089 --> 18:55.217
loud, or smelly, you have to share.

18:55.300 --> 18:59.930
No one is better than anyone else...
except maybe the rats.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.224
Everyone is kinda better than the rats.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.433
No offense, King Joey.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.353
I can't remember how to breathe.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.730
I know it might be a lot to ask,

19:08.814 --> 19:11.400
but if you would help me
get my kingdom back,

19:11.483 --> 19:15.654
it would be my honor
to share my kingdom with you.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.489
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.034
It's a simple question, Horst,
what are you drinking?

19:21.118 --> 19:25.372
My beverage is private.
Do you have no decency!

19:25.455 --> 19:26.582
[slurping]

19:26.665 --> 19:27.708
You're out of order!

19:27.791 --> 19:30.002
No, you're out of order!

19:31.336 --> 19:33.505
I have no idea why I just said that.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.800
[grunting]

19:37.426 --> 19:40.179
-Clover!
-King Julien! Maurice! Mort!

19:40.262 --> 19:43.098
Where have you been?
King without a kingdom down here!

19:43.682 --> 19:46.894
[sighing loudly] Stay there.
I'll throw down some rope to pull you up.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.813
Uh, don't think that's gonna work.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.657
Understood, Your Majesty.
Just give me a few to figure out how to--

20:00.782 --> 20:03.911
[Horst] Incoming!
Watch out for the beverage!

20:03.994 --> 20:05.037
[both grunting in pain]

20:05.120 --> 20:06.705
[Horst] And I spilled it.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.999
Was that Clover? But how...

20:09.082 --> 20:10.626
[growling]

20:11.084 --> 20:13.337
Okay, before you all
start pointing fingers,

20:13.420 --> 20:15.797
just know I never even wanted the job.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.383
I mean, come on, me a prison guard?

20:18.467 --> 20:22.012
Square peg party of one,
your hole is ready.

20:22.095 --> 20:22.930
Hector!

20:23.513 --> 20:24.890
[screaming]

20:25.515 --> 20:28.227
[whimpering] My tenders!

20:28.310 --> 20:29.436
[sighs]

20:34.191 --> 20:38.946
[exclaims] It's King Julien and he's got
a whole army of outsiders with him!

20:39.029 --> 20:40.322
[growling]

20:42.032 --> 20:44.618
Well, we got an army of our own.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.371
What's your plan, King Julien?

20:47.454 --> 20:50.123
My plan is... duck!

20:51.416 --> 20:53.585
Run away! Run away!

20:55.504 --> 20:56.338
[growling]

20:56.421 --> 20:57.798
[screaming]

20:58.590 --> 21:00.968
We got 'em on the run! Keep 'er goin'!

21:01.051 --> 21:02.678
-Pull!
-[shouting]

21:02.761 --> 21:04.263
-Pull!
-[shouting]

21:04.346 --> 21:06.139
-Pull!
-[shouting]

21:08.058 --> 21:10.310
Todd! Butterfish, do something!

21:10.394 --> 21:11.520
Stop.

21:11.603 --> 21:15.107
They ain't listenin', baby.
What do we got for lunch, girl?

21:15.190 --> 21:17.985
-Oh, boy! Here comes a big one!
-[all screaming]

21:18.068 --> 21:18.944
[exclaiming in pain]

21:19.027 --> 21:20.696
It's over, King Julien.

21:20.779 --> 21:24.032
Unless you want another taste
of our righteous freedom!

21:24.116 --> 21:26.660
Plenty more lemurs where those came from!

21:28.996 --> 21:31.707
Uh, actually no, there isn't.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.253
We still got Hector.

21:36.336 --> 21:39.631
I may be old and cranky
but I'm not stupid!

21:39.715 --> 21:41.675
-[Hector grunts]
-[snickers]

21:41.758 --> 21:42.634
[whimpering]

21:42.718 --> 21:43.927
Mo-Mo...

21:44.011 --> 21:45.262
Way ahead of you, Your Majesty.

21:45.971 --> 21:49.308
[clears throat] King Julien,
tear down this wall!

21:53.103 --> 21:56.565
All right, peoples,
put your booties into it!

21:59.318 --> 22:00.986
[all straining]

22:02.654 --> 22:03.905
Whoa! Whoa!

22:03.989 --> 22:05.949
[both] Evasive maneuvers!

22:10.412 --> 22:11.913
We're home.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.249
So... to the waterslide!

22:14.333 --> 22:16.168
[Mort laughs]

22:16.251 --> 22:18.670
Eh, what's wrong?
We're all sharing, remember.

22:18.754 --> 22:22.507
No offense, King Julien,
but you lemurs are crazy.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.968
And this place is a dump!

22:26.136 --> 22:28.847
Come on, gang,
the baboons are hosting a pop-up kingdom

22:28.930 --> 22:30.515
on the other side of the island.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.351
All you can eat pot-stickers, baby!

22:33.435 --> 22:34.811
[all cheering]

22:35.854 --> 22:37.105
Uh...

22:37.189 --> 22:40.275
Man, I hate diplomacy. Stupid diplomacy.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.945
["Stuff, stuff, stuff" song playing]
