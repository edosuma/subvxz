Look, them HIVE's is
coming out empty-handed.

09:06.415 --> 09:09.113
Yo! HIVE!
Your crime is meaningless.

09:09.157 --> 09:11.376
Yeah! Ain'ts no money
in there, fools!

09:11.420 --> 09:13.596
The people tooks it
when they left!

09:15.250 --> 09:17.426
Whoa. We didn't even
have to fight.

09:17.469 --> 09:20.168
The knowledge
of their inconsequence
defeated them.

09:20.211 --> 09:23.171
Well, I'm gonna celebrate
my inconsequence
with some pizza.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.347
Oh, but the line will be
the endless.

09:25.390 --> 09:28.611
Yous forgot. Star.
No peoples, no line.

09:28.655 --> 09:29.786
No line?

09:29.830 --> 09:31.092
For the pizzas?

09:31.135 --> 09:33.442
I am loving this empty city!

09:33.485 --> 09:36.750
And it's all thanks to
our reprehensible
behavior, Titans.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.795
[all exclaiming]

09:38.839 --> 09:39.970
[Starfire] Oh, the no!

09:40.014 --> 09:41.668
The pizza place is abandoned.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.452
If there is nobody
left in Jump City

09:43.495 --> 09:45.715
that means there
is nobody left to make pizzas.

09:45.759 --> 09:48.500
No pizza? [screams]

09:48.544 --> 09:49.632
Whats we gonna do?

09:49.676 --> 09:52.374
Without pizzas,
we's gonna starve, yo!

09:52.417 --> 09:55.029
We should just
lie down and wait
for death's cold embrace.

09:55.072 --> 09:57.553
So the cold. [shivers]

09:57.597 --> 09:58.902
Don't give up, Titans.

09:58.946 --> 10:01.296
There is still one thing,
we haven't tried.

10:01.339 --> 10:02.689
Move to Stockton?

10:02.732 --> 10:04.647
Yeah, I was gonna say
we should move to Stockton.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.736
They probably have tons
of pizza there.

10:06.780 --> 10:07.694
Titans, go!

10:07.737 --> 10:09.870

10:12.176 --> 10:14.570
