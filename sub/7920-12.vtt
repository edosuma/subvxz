00:02.536 --> 00:03.936
I need your advice
on these wedding invites.

00:03.938 --> 00:05.337
I like calligraphy
option number two;

00:05.339 --> 00:06.538
it looks like
a Bone Thugs album.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.274
This looks like an ad
for a bong company.

00:09.276 --> 00:10.609
I like option one better.

00:10.611 --> 00:11.610
WINSTON: You know
what would be nice?

00:11.612 --> 00:12.878
A wedding invitation

00:12.880 --> 00:14.213
engraved on a plate.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.048
(chuckling)

00:17.718 --> 00:18.784
What a magical wedding
that would be.

00:18.786 --> 00:19.852
You two are imbeciles.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.720
Anybody with taste
and sophistication

00:21.722 --> 00:24.289
would always choose
option number two.

00:24.291 --> 00:25.657
NICK:
Are you okay?

00:25.659 --> 00:26.725
You look gray.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.160
I didn't sleep.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.895
I was up preparing for an epic
day of wedding decisions.

00:29.897 --> 00:30.896
I'm calling it D-Day.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.398
Of course,
in this situation,

00:32.400 --> 00:34.233
the "D" stands for "decisions,"

00:34.235 --> 00:35.901
and unlike the other D-Day,

00:35.903 --> 00:37.536
it will not be
a walk on the beach.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.737
That's incredibly offensive.

00:38.739 --> 00:39.738
I know.
(door closes)

00:39.740 --> 00:40.739

00:40.741 --> 00:41.874
Do you guys remember

00:41.876 --> 00:43.208
that audition I had
for gas station TV?

00:43.210 --> 00:44.710
Well,

00:44.712 --> 00:47.012
the girl they hired went missing

00:47.014 --> 00:49.581
and they need me to fill in!
Yeah! What?

00:49.583 --> 00:50.916
Oh! JESS: Oh, my God,
we're gonna be friends

00:50.918 --> 00:52.518
with a gas celebrity!

00:52.520 --> 00:53.519
That's right!

00:53.521 --> 00:55.320
But it is today,

00:55.322 --> 00:57.556
and I know you need my help
with the wedding stuff...

00:57.558 --> 00:59.224
Cece, what are you talking
about? Are you crazy?

00:59.226 --> 01:00.426
You have to go to this.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.427
I can do it
all by my...

01:01.429 --> 01:02.594

01:04.598 --> 01:05.597
Are you okay?

01:05.599 --> 01:07.666
(yawns)

01:08.903 --> 01:11.303
Wow, your mouth
has been open forever.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.740
Okay, this is crazy.
I'm just gonna stay home.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.508
No, Cece, you have to go, please.
It's... it's...

01:16.510 --> 01:17.776
Okay. I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.011
I can help with wedding stuff.

01:19.013 --> 01:20.245
Just lighten the load
a little bit.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.613
Sometimes I think

01:21.615 --> 01:23.749
I was bred in a lab
to help people.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.250
You know what else
they bred in the lab?

01:25.252 --> 01:26.752
Pugs.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.354
Thank you, Jess.
That would be great.

01:29.356 --> 01:30.589
Uh, no, Cece.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.924
I don't have time
to bring her up to speed.

01:31.926 --> 01:33.559
Throwing her
into the fray now

01:33.561 --> 01:35.127
would be like putting
a baby on a treadmill.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.628
She would... just shoot off.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.430
Baby, you're just being
protective of the wedding, okay?

01:38.432 --> 01:39.865
Jess is just gonna help.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.533
She's not gonna take over.

Am I proud of it?
No.

Did I do it?
Yes.

my Aunt Terry.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.070
Okay, one glass.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.907
Javier, you take
the early shift

07:21.909 --> 07:23.942
on... Saturday.

07:23.944 --> 07:24.910
Ugh.
Come on, listen,

07:24.912 --> 07:26.912
I got to do what I got
to do, you know?

07:26.914 --> 07:28.914
Uh, Gina, wait to induce

07:28.916 --> 07:32.250

07:32.252 --> 07:33.452
Gina, don't you have
something on Sunday?

07:33.454 --> 07:35.153
My husband has his
fantasy baseball league.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.088
He won't attend the birth
if it doesn't happen.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.890
That's not the man you
should be with, I'm sorry.

07:38.892 --> 07:39.891
All right, where do
you want these?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.493
Winston, where do we want these?

07:41.495 --> 07:42.761
Where do we want...?
Winston? No, dude.

07:42.763 --> 07:43.895
I don't know you
like that, man.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.096
Put 'em where
the beer goes.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.431
Come on, man, I got
eight more deliveries.

07:46.433 --> 07:47.799
Look, I don't like
the early shift.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.469
(disgruntled chattering)
Mercy?

07:50.471 --> 07:53.271
Yes! Yes, yes, man.
That's what I thought.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.606
Cheese, the keg's gonna
go where it always goes,

07:54.608 --> 07:55.774
right behind the bar.

07:55.776 --> 07:56.775
Guys, the schedule.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.443
Oh, that's perfect. Thanks.
That works?

07:58.445 --> 07:59.644
Back to work, everybody.
Good stuff.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.112
WINSTON:
Listen, I get it.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.447
This is confusing
and everything,

08:02.449 --> 08:04.916
and I can't just walk in
off the street

08:04.918 --> 08:06.918
and do your job
instantaneously.

08:06.920 --> 08:07.953
But come on.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.120
Let's be real.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.456
It's still not harder
than being a cop.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.692
Then prove it.
Oh, I'll prove it.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.962
Look, I know I told you
to prove it,

08:16.964 --> 08:18.296
but I got to get
back to the bar.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.965
I just got a text
from Javier that said,

08:19.967 --> 08:22.300
"fire extinguisher"
question mark.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.302
Well, all I got to say is,
buckle up, Miller.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.304
It's about to be
a bumpy ride.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.974

where are my sunglasses?

08:30.644 --> 08:31.977
How the hell
should I know?

08:31.979 --> 08:33.979
I specifically asked you
to keep track of my sunglasses.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.981
And I told you I'm not
your freaking mother.

08:35.983 --> 08:38.650
Okay, you know what, calm down,
I'll just squint then.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.151
Do what you got
to do, man.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.153
Is this how all partners
talk to each other?

08:42.155 --> 08:44.189
(laughing):
Welcome to hell, Miller.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.125
I'm no good at normal life,

08:47.127 --> 08:50.195
but when I'm in the ocean
and drinking wine...

08:51.665 --> 08:53.164

with a beautiful stranger...

08:53.166 --> 08:55.000

08:55.002 --> 08:56.701

a little manchego?

09:03.377 --> 09:05.877

Chairs are color-coded

11:40.701 --> 11:41.700
Why?

11:41.702 --> 11:43.201
Why would I talk to my dad?

11:43.203 --> 11:45.870
He left my mom and basically
missed my entire childhood.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.205
And every time I did
invite him to something,

11:47.207 --> 11:49.507
he never showed up:
middle school graduation,

11:49.509 --> 11:51.176
high school
graduation,

11:51.178 --> 11:52.844
when I played
the titular role

in a stage adaptation
of<i> Uncle Buck.</i>

surfing? How nice.

French-kisses his customers.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.519
What a hero.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.822
Why did you have his number
in the wedding drive at all?

12:05.826 --> 12:09.160
Because I was maybe...

12:09.162 --> 12:11.496
warming up to the
idea of inviting him,

12:11.498 --> 12:13.164
but now that the nightmare

12:13.166 --> 12:15.500
called "this afternoon"
has happened,

12:15.502 --> 12:18.837
I can very well see
that I'm not ready.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.445
What a line.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.647
Who is this clown?

15:49.649 --> 15:52.317
Bottle opener in here?
Well... oh.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.485
Oh, actually,

15:54.487 --> 15:57.455
um, change of plans--
I can't go on a date tonight,

15:57.457 --> 16:00.224
because I have to have dinner
with one of my friends' fathers,

16:00.226 --> 16:01.426
coincidentally.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.261
No pressure.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.763
It's just that I had
a lot of fun today.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.432
And, uh,

16:07.434 --> 16:09.534
I'd like to see you again.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.138
(shouts)

16:14.140 --> 16:15.473
What was that?
Oh.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.842
Gunshots-- the neighborhood's
in a real slide.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.347
This is my son's name.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.481
7 billion people.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.316
There's got to be some overlap.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.818
We'd better get you back
to Calabasas, mister.

16:26.820 --> 16:27.819
Wait a minute.
'Cause...

16:27.821 --> 16:29.020
This<i> is</i> my son!

16:29.022 --> 16:30.822
Oh, my God,
do you know my son?

16:30.824 --> 16:32.490
Kind of.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.325
Does he live here?
Uh...

16:34.327 --> 16:36.494
Is he here right now?

16:36.496 --> 16:38.830
I didn't know you were
Schmidt's dad when we kissed.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.832
And you didn't know
I was his roommate.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.334
And those are facts
that will haunt us forever.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.869
(chuckles)

16:44.871 --> 16:46.637
But I can't let you
go in there.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.773
Because... he's not
ready to see you.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.342
And for once today, I...
Okay.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.311
I want to respect his wishes.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.179
I get it.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.215
Um, wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.516
No, I'll go.
Wait, wait.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.650
What?

16:59.652 --> 17:01.185
He's in there.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.990
Shh.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.258
She told him.

17:11.398 --> 17:12.997
Son?

17:12.999 --> 17:14.832
Babe, I think you should watch.
I don't...

17:14.834 --> 17:16.034
Son.
You should watch.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.668
I know you're mad.
I get it.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.037
Do you want me
to take this off?

17:19.039 --> 17:20.671
I didn't do a good job
being your father.

17:20.673 --> 17:21.973
You're in a zone.
I'm just gonna sit tight.

17:21.975 --> 17:23.241
And now you're
getting married.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.742
I get it.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.377
I wouldn't have
invited me, either.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.545
I've missed a lot.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.414
I'm sorry.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.849
In my defense,

17:31.851 --> 17:33.351
I was stoned
for most of the '90s.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.719
And the 2000s.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.088
Full disclosure--
I was stoned this morning.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.023
I like weed.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.759
But the point is,

17:41.761 --> 17:44.896
if you can forgive me
even a little,

17:44.898 --> 17:47.165
I'd love to have
a drink with you.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.101
And meet the man
that you've become.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.607
Come on.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.583
Gavin.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.952
That's okay-- Gavin, not Dad.

18:07.954 --> 18:08.753
That's just where
I'm at right now.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.121
Understood.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.690
I'm grateful you're calling me
anything at all.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.159
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.096
And I know that it might
not seem genuine,

18:18.098 --> 18:19.864
because the only reason
I came here today

18:19.866 --> 18:22.133
was to do stuff
with your roommate.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.602
(groans)
But in the past ten years,

18:24.604 --> 18:26.904
I must've picked up that phone
to call you and apologize

18:26.906 --> 18:30.441
a hundred times.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.344
I really am sorry.

18:35.148 --> 18:38.950
Gavin, this is my
fiancée Cece.

18:38.952 --> 18:42.653
<i> She</i> is the reason that I am
the man that I am today.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.222
It's wonderful
to meet you, Cece.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.957
I'm the terrible father.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.625
Thank you.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.960
Because whatever you did

18:48.962 --> 18:50.294
or didn't do,

18:50.296 --> 18:53.131
Schmidt turned out amazing.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.470
All right.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.139
I'm gonna head out.

19:01.141 --> 19:04.041
I'm sure it will be
a beautiful wedding.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.446
I wasn't very good
at being married.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.649
But thankfully you seem
like you're nothing like me.

19:15.021 --> 19:18.623
For what it's worth,

19:18.625 --> 19:21.792
I like the second option.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.828
Timeless.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.565
I agree.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.736
Good-bye.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.508
Okay, wa-- uh...
(clears his throat)

19:37.510 --> 19:39.577
Wait, uh...

19:40.780 --> 19:43.014
Here, that's for you.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.186
Let's see if you can
show up this time.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.254
I hope that you do.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.825
Thank you.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.861
There's no plus one,
so don't even ask.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.262
I'll be there.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.967
(sighs)

20:02.969 --> 20:05.870
Back to square one
on the seating chart.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.372
Oh!

20:08.374 --> 20:10.708
Sorry, I'm a little bit jumpy.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.210
God, they should
really make

20:12.212 --> 20:14.679
a TV show based off
what you guys do.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.048
You know, I've been telling
that to Aly since forever!

20:17.050 --> 20:18.216
It'd be a great idea.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.550
Hello, Hollywood!

20:19.552 --> 20:20.251
It's a big show!

20:20.253 --> 20:21.252
Yeah, it's a hit.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.387
I want to apologize.

20:23.389 --> 20:26.557
I'm sorry that I thought my job
was harder than yours.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.392
It's not.
I'm just making schedules

20:28.394 --> 20:30.027
and buying beer.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.495
Look, man.
(chuckles)

20:31.497 --> 20:33.731
The whole thing
has been pretty idiotic.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.367
You know, uh, my job
is harder than yours.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.868
Yes, that's a fact.
We all know it.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.904
But I got to say, man,
this is first time

20:39.906 --> 20:42.039
I've seen you really care
about your job.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.742
(chuckles)
You're killing it.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.911
It means a lot to me
that you said that.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.779
So thank you.
Yeah, yeah.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.415
So, look, I got...
I got us burgers.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.617
Oh!
You know,

20:52.619 --> 20:54.552
I figured we're both too busy
for steak.

20:54.554 --> 20:57.255
(both laugh)
The tradition!

20:57.257 --> 20:59.924
Nick, I need a drink.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.593
It'd better be green,
sweet and in a fun glass.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.694
Schmidt, are you okay?

21:03.696 --> 21:05.596
I mean, you look
a little freaked...

21:05.598 --> 21:07.198
Oh... oh-oh, Cece!

21:07.200 --> 21:08.266
Cece's pregnant!

21:08.268 --> 21:09.433
No.
Ow.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.435
Jess made out
with Schmidt's dad.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.737
Oh, my God!

21:12.739 --> 21:15.306
So many emotions.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.775
♪ Got an old hound dog ♪

21:17.777 --> 21:20.845
♪ Bobby Joe is his name ♪

21:22.282 --> 21:24.282
♪ Got an old hound dog... ♪

21:24.284 --> 21:25.783
Well, I mean,
did you like it?

21:25.785 --> 21:28.252
Don't answer that.
Ew, it was Schmidt's dad.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.788
You're not answering the question.
No, she's not answering the question.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.657
Sweetie, you don't
have to say anything.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.993
I liked it a little bit.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.996
