WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:02.830
you and judith were meant for each other.

00:02.840 --> 00:04.500
What could possibly come between you?

00:04.530 --> 00:05.900
My sister.

00:05.910 --> 00:07.340
You got a sister?

00:07.350 --> 00:09.030
You know what,herb?Judith can relax.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.080
I'm going to check into a hotel.

00:11.090 --> 00:13.290
Myra,no,you don't have to do that.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.380
Yes,she does.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.490
Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait-- you don't have to stay at a hotel.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.070
I've got plenty of room at my place.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.330
Yeah,I'll bet you do.

00:20.340 --> 00:21.930
No strings attached.

00:21.950 --> 00:25.130
Why can't I sleep in my bed?
Aunt myra's not there.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.680
I'm sure she will be.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.560
She's probably just getting something in the kitchen.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.150
that's not the kitchen.

00:57.480 --> 01:01.770
thinking of chewing your arm off?

01:02.390 --> 01:05.760
What?No,no,no,why would I do that?

01:05.780 --> 01:12.020
I don't know,maybe because you're not horny anymore and you just remembered I'm staying through the weekend.

01:14.260 --> 01:17.620
You got all that from the twitching of my shoulder muscles?

01:18.660 --> 01:21.520
I have those muscles too,charlie.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.520
Okay,good to know.

01:24.540 --> 01:31.470
Well,to be honest,I did have a momentary panic reflex,but it passed and I'm actually happy you're here.

01:31.490 --> 01:33.200
You sound surprised.

01:33.220 --> 01:36.100
Surprised doesn't begin to cover it.

01:37.310 --> 01:42.400
Normally,at this point in a relationship,I'm busy plotting the appropriate exit strategy.

01:42.420 --> 01:44.250
For example?

01:44.270 --> 01:51.470
Well,that would depend on whether I'm trying to get rid of them just for today or forever.

01:51.980 --> 01:53.800
Let's say today.

01:53.820 --> 01:58.550
Okay,today,I have to see my dermatologist about a little rash.

01:58.570 --> 02:00.500
Oh,that's good.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.270
All right,what about forever?

02:02.290 --> 02:06.180
Turns out it wasn't a rash-- and they won't let me come home.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.750
-Impressive.
-Thank you.

02:08.770 --> 02:11.580
I'm kind of a savant.

02:12.940 --> 02:15.000
Well,it looks like you're good at two things.

02:15.020 --> 02:17.130
What's the other one?

02:21.210 --> 02:24.220
-Oh,right.
-The piano.

02:25.790 --> 02:26.950
<font color="#ffff00">Two And A Half Men

02:27.420 --> 02:30.290
okay,I just checked-- no one slept in my bed all night.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.230
It's none of your business who slept where.

02:32.250 --> 02:35.810
Excuse me,but if who sleeps in my bed is not my business,then what is?

02:35.830 --> 02:38.230
Let it go,goldilocks.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.270
-Morning.
-Morning.

02:40.290 --> 02:43.380
And how many times do you have to get up to go pee?

02:43.400 --> 02:44.530
I wasn't counting.

02:44.550 --> 02:47.360
I was-- four.

02:47.380 --> 02:48.910
Okay,one of those was to get a glass of water.

02:48.930 --> 02:49.830
Well,there's your problem.

02:49.850 --> 02:52.190
Stop topping off the tank.

02:53.070 --> 02:54.380
What's going on?

02:54.400 --> 02:55.920
I had to sleep in dad's room last night

02:55.940 --> 02:58.470
'cause uncle charlie invited aunt myra to stay in my room

02:58.490 --> 03:01.400
-but it turns out...
-got it.

03:01.690 --> 03:03.000
Well,do you think it's fair?

03:03.020 --> 03:05.770
Nothing about your uncle charlie's life is fair,kid.

03:05.790 --> 03:07.160
Hurry up and finish your breakfast.

03:07.180 --> 03:08.810
We've got to get you fitted for a tux.

03:08.830 --> 03:10.460
Why do I have to wear a tuxedo?

03:10.480 --> 03:13.100
Because your mother's getting married and you're in the wedding party.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.010
Why do I have to be in the wedding party?

03:15.030 --> 03:17.410
Because your mother still thinks you're cute.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.330
-Morning.
-Morning.

03:20.350 --> 03:21.880
Everybody get a good night's sleep?

03:21.900 --> 03:23.500
-No.
-No.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.270
Say,charlie,where's this houseguest I'm hearing about?

03:26.290 --> 03:30.620
Uh,gee,I guess she's probably still asleep in jake's room.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.010
Oh,please,you are such a liar.

03:33.470 --> 03:34.010
What?

03:34.030 --> 03:35.940
Forget it,charlie,we know.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.910
-You do?
-We do.

03:38.930 --> 03:42.190
Okay,well,I got a good night's sleep.

03:42.210 --> 03:45.230
Probably because aunt myra doesn't pee a lot.

03:48.050 --> 03:49.530
Can I talk to you in private?

03:49.550 --> 03:51.460
Come on,it's no big deal.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.540
I was in the middle of flossing and suddenly,there she is,sitting on my bed...

03:57.240 --> 04:01.230
-He doesn't need to hear this.
-Fine.

04:01.820 --> 04:04.620
Like I didn't hear enough last night.

04:08.970 --> 04:14.470
Okay,uh,let me just start by saying I applaud the,uh...

04:14.490 --> 04:17.390
the gusto with which you approach life.

04:17.410 --> 04:18.470
Thank you.

04:18.490 --> 04:20.920
Um,that being said,uh...

04:20.940 --> 04:25.030
are you,um,out of your frickin' mind?

04:26.380 --> 04:27.790
Beg pardon?

04:27.810 --> 04:29.740
You just could not control yourself.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.240
A female's in the house-- she must be mounted.

04:33.460 --> 04:35.090
No,it's not like that at all.

04:35.110 --> 04:36.780
And why do you even care?

04:36.800 --> 04:39.890
Why?You ask me why?

04:40.260 --> 04:42.850
Never mind,unimportant.

04:42.870 --> 04:44.670
I will tell you why.

04:44.690 --> 04:49.860
Because every time you rut with any woman even remotely connected to my life

04:49.880 --> 04:51.060
I end up suffering.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.770
Oh,that's ridiculous.

04:52.790 --> 04:54.490
Ridiculous you say?

04:54.510 --> 04:57.750
All right,all right,let's look at the record.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.690
Um,you slept with judith's sister...

05:00.710 --> 05:04.320
-well,yeah,but...
-at my wedding reception!

05:06.120 --> 05:08.510
All right,poor timing.

05:08.530 --> 05:12.390
You had more sex on my wedding day than I did.

05:12.410 --> 05:15.240
That part's not my fault.

05:15.260 --> 05:17.690
Okay,okay.Let's jump ahead.

05:18.070 --> 05:24.120
Uh,when judith was divorcing me,who seduced and then abandoned my lawyer

05:24.140 --> 05:26.830
Bcausing her to take revenge on me?

05:26.850 --> 05:28.850
Hold on,that chick was nuts.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.950
I lost everything.

05:30.970 --> 05:34.690
Well,to be fair,you didn't have that much to begin with.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.610
And now...

05:41.630 --> 05:44.940
that judith is finally getting remarried

05:44.960 --> 05:48.470
and I can see the light at the end of the alimony tunnel

05:48.490 --> 05:54.560
you decide,"hey,why don't I start humping her new sister-in-law?

05:54.580 --> 05:56.330
That is not how it happened.

05:56.350 --> 05:57.740
I don't care how it happened.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.330
I only care how it's going to end.

05:59.350 --> 06:01.640
And it's going to end badly for me.

06:01.660 --> 06:04.370
How?Explain how.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.890
I don't know yet.

06:05.910 --> 06:08.430
That's always part of the fun.

06:09.070 --> 06:14.210
Trying to guess how your penis is going to bite me in the ass.

06:15.210 --> 06:17.220
Alan,you got to believe me here.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.400
This is different.I really like myra.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.400
Oh,you like all of them.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.650
And then you don'T.

06:25.670 --> 06:27.490
What's going to happen when you get tired of this poor girl...

06:27.510 --> 06:30.900
-Morning.
-Morning.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.180
Boy,I slept great.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.820
Jake's bed is really comfortable.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.020
Don't bother.He knows.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.000
Boy,I slept great.

06:41.020 --> 06:44.000
Charlie's a terrific lover.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.170
Oh,this one's going to be bad.

06:51.290 --> 06:54.520
I don't understand why I can't have the blue tuxedo.

06:54.840 --> 06:58.960
Because you're going to your mother's wedding,not hosting a game show on telemundo.

06:59.400 --> 07:03.080
This from a grown man wearing a green polo shirt.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.680
Look,all the other men are going to be wearing black tuxedos.

07:09.700 --> 07:13.060
If all the other men were jumping off a bridge would you want me to do that,too?

07:13.080 --> 07:15.350
If it would keep your mother off my back,yes.

07:15.370 --> 07:18.020
-I'll get the jacket.
-Thank you.

07:18.510 --> 07:20.770
Listen,this is a very big day for your mother.

07:20.790 --> 07:24.220
It's important that you cooperate and make her proud of you.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.830
I'm her son-- she has to be proud of me.

07:26.850 --> 07:29.000
You think so,huh?

07:29.020 --> 07:32.450
-Have you met my mother?
-Oh,yeah.

07:33.180 --> 07:34.740
Let me explain something to you.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.410
A woman's wedding day is something she will remember for the rest of her life.

07:38.430 --> 07:41.610
So if you screw it up,she will never forgive you.

07:41.630 --> 07:42.940
Even if it were your brother's fault

07:42.960 --> 07:46.720
and that there was nothing you could do to prevent it short of having him fixed.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.120
Don't worry,dad,it will be fine.

07:50.490 --> 07:51.470
Thank you.

07:51.490 --> 07:54.270
I don't have a brother.

07:55.930 --> 08:00.300
Okay,we haven't really talked about what all this means.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.420
What what means?

08:01.440 --> 08:03.610
All the big changes that are happening.

08:03.630 --> 08:05.050
It's just a couple of hairs,dad.

08:05.070 --> 08:08.020
It's not that big a deal.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.330
Not-not those changes,but...

08:15.350 --> 08:18.800
the wedding,I mean,you're going to have a stepdad in your life.

08:18.820 --> 08:19.760
So?

08:19.780 --> 08:22.180
So,is there anything you want to talk about?

08:22.200 --> 08:24.000
Do you have any questions?

08:24.020 --> 08:26.460
-Just one.
-Yeah,buddy?

08:26.480 --> 08:29.880
Why can't I wear the blue tuxedo?

08:32.429 --> 08:35.480
jake,your dinner's getting cold.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.780
So,what did you guys do today?

08:37.799 --> 08:42.890
We went on the universal studios tour and then charlie took me to the hollywood wax museum.

08:42.909 --> 08:45.330
You're kidding!
I thought you hated that touristy stuff.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.630
What gave you that idea?

08:46.650 --> 08:48.760
Well,whenever I ask you to go someplace like that

08:48.780 --> 08:51.740
you say,"I hate that touristy stuff.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.250
-Well,this is different.
-How?

08:54.270 --> 08:57.400
I enjoy her company.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.040
And it's my first trip to L.A.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.500
So I want to do all the traditional stuff.

09:01.520 --> 09:06.120
Tomorrow,we're going to sit in rush hour traffic and give other drivers the finger.

09:08.050 --> 09:10.210
Good evening.

09:12.310 --> 09:13.670
Why are you wearing that?

09:13.690 --> 09:14.960
You said I looked great in it.

09:14.980 --> 09:17.790
You do,but I don't want you messing it up before your mom's wedding.

09:17.810 --> 09:19.050
I won't mess it up.

09:19.070 --> 09:22.170
Oh,come on,alan,you've got to admit he lends a bit of class to the place.

09:22.190 --> 09:25.160
Thank you,my good man.

09:25.180 --> 09:29.970
Hey,speaking of the wedding,charlie,I have a favor I'd like to ask.

09:29.990 --> 09:31.070
Sure.

09:31.090 --> 09:33.080
Well,I have to be there,and I was just thinking that

09:33.100 --> 09:38.550
the only way it is going to be any fun,is if you come with me.

09:46.440 --> 09:49.960
you want me to be your date at judith's wedding?

09:52.600 --> 09:54.770
yeah.

09:54.790 --> 09:57.050
We'll have some laughs-- what do you say?

10:02.320 --> 10:04.750
I'm laughing already.

10:22.260 --> 10:23.920
well,that's too bad,herb!

10:23.940 --> 10:28.230
You tell judith if she wants me to be a bridesmaid and wear that brown satin turd of a dress

10:28.250 --> 10:32.950
then I am entitled to bring whoever I want as a date,and I want charlie!

10:34.420 --> 10:39.200
Okay,bye.See?No problem.

10:52.650 --> 10:54.510
Hi,judith.

10:58.110 --> 11:00.800
Problem.

11:01.430 --> 11:04.400
-Here's your suit.
-Thanks,berta.

11:04.420 --> 11:08.730
The dry cleaners found $46 and a condom in the breast pocket.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.840
Here's the condom.

11:13.290 --> 11:15.710
Again,thanks.

11:15.730 --> 11:17.840
Can I give you some free advice?

11:17.860 --> 11:20.770
Free?I'm already down $46.

11:20.790 --> 11:24.570
What is it you always say about going to a wedding with a woman you're sleeping with?

11:24.590 --> 11:25.870
This is different,berta.

11:25.890 --> 11:31.700
You say-- and I quote-- "better I should light myself on fire and run through a meth lab.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.280
Oh,that's just a figure of speech.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.980
Come on,charlie,what are you doing with this girl?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.160
What do you mean?

11:40.180 --> 11:41.960
I mean,she's a nice kid.

11:41.980 --> 11:43.540
You're gonna break her heart.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.150
-You don't know that.
-I know you.

11:46.170 --> 11:50.530
Myra's not one of your handi wipes in high heels that you can just throw out after you...

11:50.550 --> 11:53.500
-wipe your handi.
-Yeah?

11:55.010 --> 11:59.690
Well,you don't know what you're talking about,because this relationship is not based on sex.

11:59.710 --> 12:01.580
Not based on sex?

12:01.600 --> 12:05.320
Well,unless she sweats bourbon and farts hundred-dollar bills

12:05.340 --> 12:08.530
what exactly is gonna keep you together?

12:09.600 --> 12:12.440
Oh,crap.

12:17.460 --> 12:18.760
No,judith,you listen to me.

12:18.780 --> 12:22.180
If myra wants to bring charlie to the wedding,then that's her business.

12:22.200 --> 12:22.910
N-no.

12:22.930 --> 12:25.220
No,I will not intervene,and you're just gonna have to live with it.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.470
Good-bye!

12:27.490 --> 12:29.020
I changed my mind.
I'm not going to the wedding.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.080
Ooh,thank god!

12:33.300 --> 12:35.110
Judith,great news.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.120
I talked him out of it.

12:38.790 --> 12:41.400
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:41.420 --> 12:44.320
-Whatcha doing?
-Grading tests.

12:44.340 --> 12:46.130
10th grade economics?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.690
-Ask me a question
-okey

12:48.710 --> 12:51.280
The functions and implications of monetary policy...

12:51.300 --> 12:53.340
never mind.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.110
You sure?I grade on a curve.

12:55.130 --> 12:58.190
That's all right; I'm stupid on a straight line.

12:59.530 --> 13:03.450
Listen,um...about the wedding,uh...

13:04.460 --> 13:07.270
I don'T...I don't think I should go.

13:07.290 --> 13:09.140
Okay.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.890
I'm just concerned that-that maybe we should slow things down a bit.

13:12.910 --> 13:17.560
-What things?
-You know...things.

13:18.210 --> 13:22.380
I mean...you don't know me that well,and...

13:22.400 --> 13:25.760
I'm afraid that I might hurt you without meaning to.

13:26.610 --> 13:30.350
-Don't worry about it.
-Okay,good.I won'T.

13:36.290 --> 13:39.130
Exactly what is it I'm not worrying about?

13:39.150 --> 13:41.170
-Hurting me.
-Right.

13:44.140 --> 13:46.450
And why am I not worrying about that?

13:46.470 --> 13:48.700
I'm a big girl,charlie.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.670
Some might even say a woman.

13:54.570 --> 13:58.270
I want to go to the wedding with you.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.210
Don't worry about jake-- I'll get him there in plenty of time.

14:01.230 --> 14:03.610
Well,you are very welcome.

14:03.630 --> 14:06.300
Best of luck to you and her.Bye-bye.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.330
I'm going to the wedding.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.030
what is this,candle wax?

14:16.050 --> 14:18.840
How do you get candle wax on the seat of your pants?

14:18.860 --> 14:21.140
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

14:21.160 --> 14:23.930
Okay,I might've lit a couple of farts.

14:27.170 --> 14:29.430
I'm ready.Myra's ready.Is he ready?

14:29.450 --> 14:31.360
Does he look ready?

14:31.930 --> 14:34.730
Well,he's not wearing any pants.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.210
That's ready for some things.

14:38.490 --> 14:40.570
Just go ahead.I'll get him there.

14:40.590 --> 14:42.160
Okay.

14:44.740 --> 14:47.520
What is that?

14:48.770 --> 14:50.610
Pudding.

15:10.170 --> 15:13.420
you know what?I just realized something.

15:13.440 --> 15:17.160
I am two for two at judith's weddings.

15:17.180 --> 15:21.160
What a coincidence-- I'm two for two at herb's weddings.

15:22.490 --> 15:24.960
Okay.What about funerals?

15:24.980 --> 15:29.670
-Can you beat a three-way in a hearse.
-No.

15:29.690 --> 15:31.940
You have to think about it?

15:31.960 --> 15:34.230
It's a gray area.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.380
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.350
We were having sex in the coatroom.

15:40.410 --> 15:42.840
Good one.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.140
Listen,one of my groomsmen got food poisoning

15:45.160 --> 15:47.120
so you're gonna have to walk down the aisle with uncle fred.

15:47.140 --> 15:48.390
Uncle fred?

15:48.410 --> 15:50.230
Is that the only man left?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.410
Well,there's cousin trudy.

15:51.430 --> 15:54.620
She's pre-op,but she's wearing a very nice tux.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.450
Why can't I just walk down the aisle with charlie?

15:58.110 --> 16:00.460
Whoa,I'm just an innocent bystander at this shindig.

16:00.480 --> 16:04.130
Oh,come on,picture the look on judith's face when she sees you at the altar.

16:04.850 --> 16:08.820
-I'm in.
-Oh,god.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.470
Herb.Herb.

16:13.490 --> 16:15.490
Hey,thanks for bringing him down.

16:15.510 --> 16:16.930
Well,you look very handsome,jake.

16:16.950 --> 16:19.490
I know.It's the tux.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.740
Okay,well,uh,congratulations.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.130
I wish you both a lot of happiness.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.220
Oh,thanks,al.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.750
Don't make the same mistakes I did.

16:25.770 --> 16:28.130
I won't-- she wrote them down for me.

16:28.150 --> 16:31.610
Good.All right,buddy,uh,have some fun.

16:31.630 --> 16:33.380
Okay.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.220
Remember,that tux is a rental.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.020
Excuse me.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.900
Are you judith's ex-husband?

16:41.920 --> 16:44.140
Uh,yeah,yeah,I was just dropping off our son.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.240
I'm sorry,do I know you?

16:45.260 --> 16:47.800
Oh,no,not really,it'S...

16:47.820 --> 16:50.700
herb and I were engaged before he met judith,so...

16:50.720 --> 16:52.070
and you're coming to his wedding?

16:52.090 --> 16:53.730
Yeah,well,we're still friends.

16:54.070 --> 16:57.510
Well,how very...california of you.

16:58.790 --> 17:01.150
Well,I wish him the best.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.020
I have to tell you,though,based on first impressions

17:04.040 --> 17:07.380
I'm not sure that judith is trading up.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.240
Thank you.

17:09.260 --> 17:14.540
uh,and having just met you,I feel safe in saying that herb's not getting an upgrade,either.

17:25.589 --> 17:27.760
oh,man!

17:37.370 --> 17:40.090
-Nice dress.
-Bite me.

17:40.110 --> 17:42.670
Okay.Meet me in the coatroom.

17:42.690 --> 17:45.730
listen,after the reception,can you take me to the airport?

17:46.100 --> 17:48.210
-You're flying home tonight?
-Yeah.

17:48.230 --> 17:49.850
I thought we had something going here.

17:49.870 --> 17:51.850
We did,and now I'm going home.

17:51.870 --> 17:54.320
Okay.Maybe I can come visit you sometime.

17:54.340 --> 17:57.000
Ooh,I don't think my boyfriend would like that very much.

17:57.020 --> 17:58.460
Your boyfriend?

17:58.480 --> 18:00.520
He's more like a fianc?

18:00.540 --> 18:03.100
You're getting married?

18:11.920 --> 18:13.720
Why didn't you tell me you were engaged?

18:13.740 --> 18:15.820
I thought it would be awkward.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.320
Awkward?

18:30.700 --> 18:32.830
You may be seated.

18:39.650 --> 18:41.600
We-we really shouldn't be doing this.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.220
Why not?They broke our hearts.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.860
Uh,yeah,but I'm kind of over it.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.260
I'm not.

18:47.390 --> 18:49.020
Mm,mm,uh,hang on,hang on.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.200
Maybe we could go out for coffee first.

18:51.220 --> 18:53.850
Or-or a movie.

18:54.060 --> 18:58.220
Alan,this is gonna happen with you or without you.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.180
With me or...

19:00.200 --> 19:01.830
How does that work?

19:01.850 --> 19:05.380
The institution of marriage is not one to enter lightly

19:05.400 --> 19:10.610
so we pause at this time to consider the depth of that commitment.

19:11.060 --> 19:15.170
Oh,alan harper,you animal!

19:15.190 --> 19:18.260
I can't believe judith let you go!

19:18.280 --> 19:20.130
Oh,god!Alan harper!

19:20.150 --> 19:25.450
Oh,god!Oh,don't stop,alan harper!

19:25.470 --> 19:27.450
Please don't stop!

19:27.470 --> 19:31.210
Oh,alan harper,I feel like a woman again!

19:34.120 --> 19:37.200
I'm alan harper,and I'm not having sex!

19:44.380 --> 19:46.780
-hey.
-Hey.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.920
How was the reception?

19:51.050 --> 19:54.100
Kind of a letdown after the ceremony.

19:56.250 --> 20:00.940
But you'll be happy to know your little outburst is already on youtube.

20:01.590 --> 20:04.210
Damn camera phones.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.840
-Boy,is mom mad at you.
-Yeah.

20:08.260 --> 20:11.850
Well,she might as well start her second marriage the same way as the first.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.390
So...drinking in the dark,eh?

20:16.410 --> 20:19.120
It wasn't dark when I started.

20:20.850 --> 20:23.530
Did you get myra to the airport?

20:24.580 --> 20:25.990
And you know what?

20:26.010 --> 20:27.760
I'll never see her again.

20:27.780 --> 20:31.040
I was just a meaningless fling to that girl.

20:32.780 --> 20:36.190
I'll bet this is that whole karma thing people talk about.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.340
Could be.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.790
you know that feeling you get when...

20:42.810 --> 20:45.150
somebody's gone from your life,and you...

20:45.170 --> 20:47.560
you suddenly realize that you miss them?

20:47.870 --> 20:50.470
Yeah.

20:50.490 --> 20:53.620
I don't care for it.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.960
Hey,you know what always cheers me up?

20:55.980 --> 20:58.380
Pigs in a blanket.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
