WEBVTT

00:03.569 --> 00:06.137
<i>(tim)</i> thank you.

00:06.138 --> 00:08.740
Oh, nonsense.
Thank you very much.

00:08.741 --> 00:10.575
And welcome once again
to <i>tool time.</i>

00:10.576 --> 00:12.310
I'm your host,
tim "the tool man" taylor.

00:12.311 --> 00:15.179
You all know my assistant,
al "I'm always free on Saturday"
borland.

00:17.783 --> 00:19.550
Boy, am I revved up
about today's show.

00:19.551 --> 00:21.452
We got a killer project
coming up.

00:21.453 --> 00:23.755
Not some wimpy project,

00:23.756 --> 00:28.093
But something every red-blooded
kidney-stone-passing american
male dreams of.

00:28.094 --> 00:29.427
<i>(grunts)</i>

00:29.428 --> 00:30.962
And what would
that be, tim?

00:30.963 --> 00:33.564
See! Even al's excited
about this one.

00:33.565 --> 00:36.601
There is nothing like

00:36.602 --> 00:39.838
Renovating a house top
to bottom. Oh, yeah.

00:39.839 --> 00:43.574
That's why this week, today
we begin our project house.

00:43.575 --> 00:46.144
Oh, yeah. Out with the old,
in with the new.

00:46.145 --> 00:49.114
Tear down the past,
pull up the future.

00:51.917 --> 00:53.417
One of my better ideas.

00:53.418 --> 00:55.053
I don't know how I keep
thinking of this stuff, al.

00:55.054 --> 00:56.554
Perhaps from watching
bob vila every week--

00:56.555 --> 01:00.491
Anyway, let's take
a look at these.

01:00.492 --> 01:02.794
Here are some ideas
that might give you ideas

01:02.795 --> 01:04.227
About putting your
home back in shape.

01:04.229 --> 01:06.931
Here's your typical
'30s craftsman home.

01:06.932 --> 01:09.634
Oh, yeah, look at that.

01:09.635 --> 01:12.403
And here's after
a crafty redo.

01:12.404 --> 01:14.873
Ohh... Look at that.

01:14.874 --> 01:16.741
Here's your typical
50s bungalow.

01:16.742 --> 01:19.310
<i>(grunts)</i> not so nice.

01:19.311 --> 01:23.815
Here's a beautiful remodel
on that. Hey, yeah...

01:23.816 --> 01:27.451
And here's a little
shack I found.

01:27.452 --> 01:30.388
And look what I did to it
over the weekend without
any help from al.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.868
Well, what do you think?
Can we put the kids
in the middle?

02:54.573 --> 02:56.775
Tim, this could be
a little tricky,

02:56.776 --> 03:00.544
But once we demolish
the kitchen counter
in the project house,

03:00.545 --> 03:02.613
We'll have about
three extra feet...

03:02.614 --> 03:06.084
Al, al, which tie do you
like better? Red or blue?

03:06.085 --> 03:07.986
Are you listening to me?
This is important.

03:07.987 --> 03:09.821
Now, I'm saying
we got about--
why am I even asking you?

03:09.822 --> 03:13.357
You think
flannel is hip.

03:13.358 --> 03:15.293
<i>(woman)</i> excuse me.

03:16.495 --> 03:18.663
I don't mean to disturb you.

03:18.664 --> 03:22.767
You're maureen, mr. Binford's
daughter, right?

03:22.768 --> 03:25.736
Very good memory, al.
Oh, I couldn't forget you.

03:25.737 --> 03:29.240
At the Halloween party, you
came dressed as a toggle switch.

03:29.241 --> 03:31.876
Yeah, well...

03:31.877 --> 03:34.813
I went for different.

03:34.814 --> 03:39.383
I mean, how many years in a row
can you show up as a hacksaw?

03:43.622 --> 03:45.857
Al, I think I'm gonna
go with the blue.
Tim, look who's here.

03:45.858 --> 03:48.026
It's maureen binford.
Hey, maureen.
Good to see you.

03:48.027 --> 03:49.994
How're you doing?
Tim, listen,
I gotta tell you.

03:49.995 --> 03:52.596
Your show just keeps getting
better and better.

03:52.597 --> 03:54.933
Well, gee, thanks.
You're welcome.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.835
All that grunting
and macho stuff.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.737
The audience really responds...
Even the women.

03:59.738 --> 04:03.808
Every time you screw up,
they laugh.

04:03.809 --> 04:08.713
And believe me,
they laugh a lot.

04:08.714 --> 04:12.016
And then you have your expertise
and your sex appeal with al.

04:15.420 --> 04:19.457
Maureen, what is it you
need, besides glasses?

04:19.458 --> 04:22.160
Oh, thank you. Actually,
I was gonna ask you that,

04:22.161 --> 04:23.761
Since I'm your
new producer.

04:23.762 --> 04:28.299
Yeah...
Whoa, back the truck up.

04:28.300 --> 04:31.035
Who made that decision?

04:31.036 --> 04:32.937
Daddy.

04:32.938 --> 04:36.241
Your dad would not make
a decision like that
without asking me, maureen.

04:36.242 --> 04:38.709
Well, he's been a bit
preoccupied lately.
With what?

04:38.710 --> 04:42.213
With the 23-year-old
tool model he just married.

04:42.214 --> 04:46.284
Your dad got married?
To miss black & decker.

04:46.285 --> 04:49.187
And believe me, I'd like to.

04:53.325 --> 04:56.460
Your dad bagged
terry louise gardner?

04:56.461 --> 04:57.828
You know who she is?

04:57.829 --> 05:02.133
Oh, yeah. She's in the spring
catalog - page 141.

05:02.134 --> 05:05.503
And most of... 142, yeah.
Pretty amazing stuff.

05:05.504 --> 05:10.942
Well, we get the catalog. So we
have to look through it, because
of re... Research.

05:10.943 --> 05:12.110
I understand.

05:12.111 --> 05:13.511
Well, you know,
the tools come in...

05:13.512 --> 05:16.214
The tools come
in every day...
The tools...

05:16.215 --> 05:18.749
Maureen, it was good
to see you here, you know.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.385
Why don't you give her
some <i>tool time</i> hats?

05:20.386 --> 05:21.619
Hats.
See you later.

05:21.620 --> 05:23.721
Oh, no, no, no...
I'm gonna be here a lot.

05:23.722 --> 05:28.226
Did I forget to mention?
Producer!

05:28.227 --> 05:30.028
Are you serious?

05:31.931 --> 05:34.165
Is this your dad's way
of telling me I'm not
doing my job?

05:34.166 --> 05:36.867
Oh, no. He thinks you're
doing a great job. And so do I.

05:36.868 --> 05:40.104
I'm missing something here,
you know. We don't need
a producer.

05:40.105 --> 05:42.473
I run this show.
Well, that was before.

05:42.474 --> 05:45.944
But now daddy made me producer.
And so now I'll be running
the show.

05:45.945 --> 05:48.046
Well, there's some
extra offices right down--

05:48.047 --> 05:49.914
Shut up, al!

05:52.017 --> 05:54.585
I don't want to give
the impression I don't
appreciate you coming down,

05:54.586 --> 05:56.454
Because I really do.

05:56.455 --> 05:58.823
But <i>tool time</i> really runs
pretty smoothly the way
it is now.

05:58.824 --> 06:01.225
So if you came down here
and you had nothing to do,

06:01.226 --> 06:04.929
We'd have no reason
to have al.

06:04.930 --> 06:07.031
Oh, you're so funny. You see,
that's what I'm saying.

06:07.032 --> 06:12.703
We are a winning combo. And I
know I can make our show better.

06:12.704 --> 06:15.773
"our" show?
Yeah. Like with
the project house.

06:15.774 --> 06:19.743
You know, your patio idea is ok.
But let's say we open it up.

06:19.744 --> 06:21.045
Ah--
all right...

06:21.046 --> 06:23.514
We add a few
french doors for light.

06:23.515 --> 06:27.285
Voila, we got ourselves
a breakfast nook.

06:27.286 --> 06:30.421
Are you crazy?
This is <i>tool time.</i>

06:30.422 --> 06:33.391
Men don't eat in a nook.

06:35.227 --> 06:39.130
You never ever hear 300-pound
construction workers going,

06:39.131 --> 06:42.133
"charlie, john, stop by
the house. I just made
fresh muffins.

06:42.134 --> 06:44.068
We'll eat it in the nook."

06:46.238 --> 06:48.172
Well, a muffin in
a nook would be cozy.

06:48.173 --> 06:50.408
Shut up, al.

06:52.244 --> 06:55.380
We already have all
the materials bought for
this project presently.

06:55.381 --> 06:57.248
You just can't change
the blueprints on a whim.

06:57.249 --> 07:00.951
Oh, now, don't be
such a gloomy gus.

07:00.952 --> 07:03.121
It's never too late.
Just think about it.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.856
Toodles.

07:05.857 --> 07:08.059
Who the hell does
she think she is,

07:08.060 --> 07:09.960
Waltzing in here and trying
to take over the show?

07:09.961 --> 07:11.795
I'm calling binford.

07:11.796 --> 07:15.199
Once I tell him what I think
on the phone, he'll fly back
tonight.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.735
Tim, tim...

07:17.736 --> 07:21.772
Take another look
at page 141... And 2.

07:23.208 --> 07:26.144
<i>(both)</i> he's not coming back.

07:33.552 --> 07:36.987
Mom, we're starving.
Tell us where you hid
the cookies.

07:36.988 --> 07:41.292
Mom, come on. We're not
having dinner for an hour.

07:41.293 --> 07:45.629
<i>(mark)</i> what are you
eating, mom?

07:45.630 --> 07:46.964
Nothing.

07:46.965 --> 07:50.301
Hey, that was
a hoop-dee-ho.
Was not.

07:50.302 --> 07:53.071
Let me smell your breath.
Hey!

07:53.072 --> 07:55.839
There will be no
breath smelling.

07:55.840 --> 07:59.910
You're so desperate for a snack,
go get some raisins.

07:59.911 --> 08:03.381
Right. Then we can have
some salad and a multivitamin.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.883
<i>(chuckles)</i>
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

08:05.884 --> 08:08.919
Come on, guys.
We need to find those
hoop-dee-hos.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.654
Mark, check the dryer.
Randy, the bookshelf.

08:10.655 --> 08:12.656
No, you doof. That's where
she hid them the last time.

08:12.657 --> 08:14.692
Well, then, check
the tv cabinet.

08:14.693 --> 08:16.860
Hey, come on.
Don't wreck the house.

08:16.861 --> 08:19.063
Yes, I think I could
do that. Uh-huh.

08:19.064 --> 08:22.766
All I found in the dryer
was some lint.

08:22.767 --> 08:25.570
Yeah, well, thank you
so much. Bye.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.973
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Guess what!

08:28.974 --> 08:32.042
I got a job. I got a job at
<i>inside detroit magazine.</i>

08:32.043 --> 08:33.376
<i>(both)</i> yes! All right!

08:33.378 --> 08:35.513
Good job.
Way to go, mom!
Way to go, mom.

08:35.514 --> 08:37.748
Yeah, I start tomorrow!

08:37.749 --> 08:40.118
<i>(whispering)</i> all right, she's
not gonna be home after school.

08:40.119 --> 08:41.586
Freedom.
Yes!

08:41.587 --> 08:44.622
I heard that.
Huh?

08:44.623 --> 08:47.325
I'm only gonna be gone a week,
and I will know everything you
do,

08:47.326 --> 08:50.128
Everywhere you go
and everything you think.

08:50.129 --> 08:52.630
Let's go upstairs
and look for the cookies.

08:54.899 --> 09:00.838
Mark, isn't it exciting?
Mommy's gonna go work at
a magazine.

09:00.839 --> 09:03.341
Who's gonna take care of us?

09:03.342 --> 09:07.911
Honey, mommy and daddy
are still gonna take care
of you.

09:07.912 --> 09:10.281
Why do you have to
go to work?

09:10.282 --> 09:12.750
Because I think
it'll be fun.

09:12.751 --> 09:15.186
Don't you have
fun at home?

09:15.187 --> 09:19.023
Sure, I do.
But, you know, sometimes

09:19.024 --> 09:22.260
You gotta go outside
the house and have
a different kind of fun.

09:22.261 --> 09:26.030
You know, like, um, what you
get to do when you go to school.

09:26.031 --> 09:28.732
I have fun at recess.

09:28.733 --> 09:31.835
Right. Mommy getting out
of the house and going to work

09:31.836 --> 09:34.305
Is exactly like recess.

09:37.842 --> 09:41.279
<i>(brad)</i> mark, get up here!
We need you to crawl
into the attic!

09:41.280 --> 09:43.080
Ok!

09:43.081 --> 09:46.884
There are no hoop-dee-hos
in the attic!

09:48.187 --> 09:50.454
<i>(door opens)</i>
<i>oh, hi, honey.</i>

09:50.455 --> 09:54.559
Man, what a day.
I have great news.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.894
Wait'll I tell you
what binford did.
No, no, no. My news first.

09:56.895 --> 09:59.797
Guess what.
Remember that interview

09:59.798 --> 10:03.033
That karen set up for me
at <i>inside detroit magazine?</i>
<i>No.</i>

10:03.034 --> 10:06.136
Oh, yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
The researchers job.

10:06.137 --> 10:09.340
They loved me, they loved
my résumé. I got the job.

10:09.341 --> 10:12.776
Hey, that's great.
It's only a temporary
thing, you know.

10:12.777 --> 10:16.980
I'm just gonna work for a week.
But I have to be there tomorrow
at 8:30.

10:16.981 --> 10:19.183
Tomorrow?
Yeah, yeah.

10:19.184 --> 10:21.552
So I need you to get
the boys off to school.

10:21.553 --> 10:23.454
I gotta be at the project house
first thing in the morning.

10:23.455 --> 10:27.425
Well, I have to be at
the office. I have to be
at the office.

10:27.426 --> 10:29.193
Can't you tell them
you're gonna be late?

10:29.194 --> 10:31.629
No, no, honey. I can't do that.
It's my first day of work.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.264
Honey, if you show up
whenever they want,

10:33.265 --> 10:36.467
They'll start taking
advantage of you.

10:36.468 --> 10:37.801
Listen, tim,

10:37.802 --> 10:41.239
I have a million things
that I have to do, you know.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.740
Jill, you don't understand.
I have to go to the dry
cleaners...

10:42.741 --> 10:44.542
...And get my jacket.
Hold it a minute. Jill...

10:44.543 --> 10:48.812
Then I have to go
to the grocery store...
Binford ran off with page 142.

10:48.813 --> 10:52.082
Oh, and I gotta go by
karen's and get a briefcase,

10:52.083 --> 10:53.317
'cause I don't have one and I
want to look professional.

10:53.318 --> 10:54.985
Toodles is taking
over <i>tool time.</i>

10:54.986 --> 10:56.754
You have to cook dinner tonight.
I'm really sorry.

10:56.755 --> 10:58.289
But there's a chicken in there.
It's only gonna take an hour
and a half.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.057
Toodles.
You got the potatoes
and the vegetables.

11:00.058 --> 11:03.427
Oh, oh, I'm gonna make the boy''
school lunches tonight before
I go to bed.

11:03.428 --> 11:04.595
I'll see you later.
Bye-bye.

11:06.398 --> 11:07.898
Bye, hon.

11:07.899 --> 11:11.201
It's been the worst day of
my life. Thanks for listening.

11:11.202 --> 11:14.739
Dad, how come you didn't make
your famous chocolate-chip
pancakes?

11:14.740 --> 11:17.074
Because I didn't have time to
make 'em. Just eat your cereal,
will ya?

11:17.075 --> 11:21.111
Well, mom usually slices up
bananas. Why don't you?

11:21.112 --> 11:24.348
Because I don't love you
as much as mom does.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.785
Ok, boys. Are you ready
for school?

11:27.786 --> 11:29.353
Yeah, whatever.
All right now.

11:29.354 --> 11:33.056
Mark, mrs. Johnson is gonna
take you to cub scouts.

11:33.057 --> 11:34.958
Please don't leave your hat
at school again, ok?

11:34.959 --> 11:37.295
Brad, you're going home with
billy after football practice.

11:37.296 --> 11:40.531
Randy, your dad's gonna
pick you up after detention.

11:40.532 --> 11:43.601
Oh, you don't
have any bananas!

11:43.602 --> 11:46.236
Here, let me slice some
up for you. Come here.

11:46.237 --> 11:47.871
Thanks, mom.

11:49.808 --> 11:52.643
This is so weird, you know.
I mean, I get to go to work
and everything,

11:52.644 --> 11:56.013
But I don't get to be here
when you kids get home from
school.

11:56.014 --> 12:00.284
I keep thinking of that first
day that I walked you to
kindergarten, brad.

12:00.285 --> 12:03.688
You know, you went up those
stairs and turned around,

12:03.689 --> 12:07.291
Waved your little
chubby hand and said,

12:07.292 --> 12:10.394
<i>(feigns crying)</i>
"b'bye, mommy."

12:10.395 --> 12:12.330
"b'bye, mommy."

12:12.331 --> 12:14.131
Oh, come on.
Stop, stop.

12:14.132 --> 12:16.200
I could walk you
to work, mommy.

12:16.201 --> 12:19.737
Aw, that is so sweet.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.539
Jill, come on, get going.
You're gonna be late.
Come on, come on.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.907
Bye, bye. Bye-bye.
Bye, mom.

12:23.908 --> 12:26.143
Good luck, honey.
Good luck at
the project house.

12:26.144 --> 12:28.746
I love this. I'm wishing you
luck. You're wishing me luck.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.481
Go, go, go.
Whoo-hoo! Ok!

12:30.482 --> 12:32.282
Bye, mom.
Bye-bye!

12:32.283 --> 12:34.184
Have fun.
Oh, hi, al. Bye.

12:34.185 --> 12:37.020
<i>(horn honks)</i>
hey, kids,
the bus is here!

12:37.021 --> 12:39.757
The bus is here. Come on, bus,
bus. Go, get your lunches.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.392
Come on.
Get your backpacks.

12:41.393 --> 12:44.462
Have fun at detention,
son.
Thanks, dad.

12:44.463 --> 12:45.796
Bye, boys.
Bye, al.

12:45.797 --> 12:47.931
Are you ready, tim?
Hey, al.
Good to see you.

12:47.932 --> 12:49.533
I want to get going
in a hurry.

12:49.534 --> 12:51.535
I want to get to
the project house
before maureen gets there.

12:51.536 --> 12:54.605
She's already there.
You're kidding.

12:54.606 --> 12:59.076
Well, when I drove by,
she was showing the crew where
the breakfast nook will be.

13:01.112 --> 13:04.615
What? I told her
no breakfast nook!

13:04.616 --> 13:09.019
I know. But I just think
maybe you should give mo
a chance.

13:09.020 --> 13:11.321
Mo?

13:11.322 --> 13:13.323
A little nickname now?

13:13.324 --> 13:15.693
What are you called? Aaa?

13:20.331 --> 13:24.001
Mo has some
very good ideas.
Oh, has mo?

13:24.002 --> 13:26.570
Well, yes. You know, yesterday
when we were having coffee
together...

13:26.571 --> 13:29.306
Having coffee together?

13:29.307 --> 13:32.009
Al, what has turned you against
me all of a sudden?

13:32.010 --> 13:33.444
Haven't I always treated you
like a brother?

13:33.445 --> 13:36.346
No.
A good friend.

13:36.347 --> 13:38.282
Good?

13:38.283 --> 13:41.552
Well, al, I'm your boss. I gotta
keep a professional distance
from you.

13:41.553 --> 13:43.020
All I'm saying is that...

13:43.021 --> 13:45.989
What the hell
do you have on?

13:47.926 --> 13:52.262
Well, mo says sometimes I tend
to blend into the background.

13:52.263 --> 13:55.699
You're supposed to blend
into the background.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.435
Well, if you don't like
the shirt, tim, fine.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.603
I'm not forcing
you to wear one.

13:59.604 --> 14:03.340
Well, good, because now we won't
be mistaken for the beach boys.

14:07.479 --> 14:11.682
So the parrot says,
"forget the cracker.
I want a lawyer!"

14:13.217 --> 14:15.820
Hey, tim. Hi.
Whoa, whoa, wait,
wait, wait.

14:15.821 --> 14:18.556
What's with the french doors?
I thought we decided there'd
be no nook.

14:18.557 --> 14:20.825
Nook-free. No nook.
Nookless.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.160
All right. We'll talk
about it later.
No, maureen.

14:23.161 --> 14:24.662
I think I wanna
talk about it right now.

14:24.663 --> 14:27.565
This is my project house,
my show and my crew.

14:27.566 --> 14:31.101
Light cream, no sugar?
You remembered.

14:32.236 --> 14:34.438
Al, do you mind?

14:34.439 --> 14:37.541
All right, everybody, let's get
started. I need you to bring
that camera right over here,

14:37.542 --> 14:39.610
And I want to get a nice shot
of the front porch.

14:39.611 --> 14:41.311
Leave the camera
right where it is.

14:41.312 --> 14:43.447
We're gonna do this shot
with me on the roof.

14:43.448 --> 14:46.316
Tim, tim, tim,
not a good idea.

14:46.317 --> 14:49.386
Mo, let's get something straight
here. This is <i>tool time.</i>

14:49.387 --> 14:52.490
It's a man's show, dangerous,
kind of devil-may-care.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.525
We'll do the shot
with me up on the roof.

14:54.526 --> 14:57.528
Ok.
The roof is unsafe.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.597
Now you're an expert
on roofs, maureen?

14:59.598 --> 15:01.565
Well, no, not really,
but I've been inside,

15:01.566 --> 15:03.934
And I do know that
those one-by-fours
are too far apart.

15:03.935 --> 15:06.436
<i>(inquisitive grunt)</i>

15:06.437 --> 15:09.272
Take a look at that sheathing.
There's rot everywhere.

15:09.273 --> 15:13.176
Maureen, I think I can tell
the difference between a safe
and an unsafe roof.

15:13.177 --> 15:14.378
Al, you following me up here?

15:14.379 --> 15:17.982
I don't think so, tim.

15:17.983 --> 15:21.084
Oh, fine.

15:21.085 --> 15:23.153
This sun is really
drying my skin out.

15:23.154 --> 15:25.656
You know, I have some
moisturizer.

15:25.657 --> 15:27.558
Shut up, al!

15:30.161 --> 15:32.563
Is there anything I can do
for you down here, tim?

15:32.564 --> 15:35.900
Yeah, why don't you get your
ukulele? You can start the luau.

15:35.901 --> 15:39.236
All right, everybody.
Let's roll!

15:41.940 --> 15:44.041
Hi. Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

15:44.042 --> 15:46.577
As you can see,
our 1955 ranch home

15:46.578 --> 15:50.280
Needs a lot of work,
especially the roof.

15:50.281 --> 15:53.717
Now, you wanna have a
professional examine
any weak or discolored areas

15:53.718 --> 15:56.520
Like these, and make sure
they're properly attended to.

15:56.521 --> 16:00.290
For now, we'll just hop
over these to a safer area.

16:03.595 --> 16:06.730
It's a little weak here.
You wanna avoid this area, too.

16:07.632 --> 16:09.366
Aah!

16:09.367 --> 16:14.371
<i>(crash)</i>
<i>(tim yelling)</i>

16:18.877 --> 16:21.211
Hey, wilson.
What are you doing?

16:21.212 --> 16:23.380
I'm gathering herbs.

16:23.381 --> 16:27.818
A warm bath of eucalyptus
and rosemary can be quite
invigorating.

16:27.819 --> 16:31.555
<i>(grunts)</i> sounds very
aromatic, yeah.

16:31.556 --> 16:34.257
I had a really bad day.
Maybe I should try some of that.

16:34.258 --> 16:35.759
Darn good idea.
Well, I'll see ya.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.160
Hold it, wilson.
I gotta ask you something.

16:37.161 --> 16:38.729
Well, maybe we can do
this tomorrow, tim?

16:38.730 --> 16:41.732
No, no. I need to ask you
right now. Um...

16:41.733 --> 16:44.501
It seems like everything
in my life is up in the air.

16:44.502 --> 16:47.037
Everything's changing.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
mm-hmm.

16:47.038 --> 16:49.807
Well, there's this woman
that came into <i>tool time.</i>

16:49.808 --> 16:51.842
She's trying to
take it over.
Mm-hmm.

16:51.843 --> 16:56.747
And... Well, I've made <i>tool</i>
<i>time</i> a success, you know,
over three years.

16:56.748 --> 16:59.950
And I don't think
it needs any change.

16:59.951 --> 17:02.419
Well, tim...

17:02.420 --> 17:05.422
Sometimes change...

17:05.423 --> 17:08.892
Can be a good thing.
Good night.

17:08.893 --> 17:11.862
Wait, wait, wait. Wilson?
<i>(door slams shut)</i>

17:16.101 --> 17:19.737
Yeah, sure. I'll be
right there. Bye.

17:19.738 --> 17:22.405
Hey, brad, can I talk
to you for a minute?
Sorry, dad.

17:22.406 --> 17:25.308
I told jennifer
I'd be right there.
Oh.

17:25.309 --> 17:29.079
Hey, buddy, mark.
I need to talk to somebody.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.515
You can always
talk to me.

17:31.516 --> 17:34.018
Good. Come sit down here
for a minute.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.923
Come here. I'm gonna try
to work this out, ok?

17:39.924 --> 17:42.459
Let's say you
got this business.

17:42.460 --> 17:46.396
Uh, bubblegum factories.
Somebody comes in and tries--

17:46.397 --> 17:49.099
Will I have cherry bubblegum?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:49.100 --> 17:52.402
Probably racks of the best
they have. Of course, a lot
of that cherry bubblegum.

17:52.403 --> 17:54.437
Anyway, so--
do I have
baseball cards?

17:54.438 --> 17:56.540
Yeah, you got baseball cards.

17:56.541 --> 17:58.475
You've got a little assistant
with a little beard. Whatever
you want.

17:58.476 --> 18:02.046
You got everything. Anyway, so,
you got this bubblegum factory

18:02.047 --> 18:04.014
- Cherry bubblegum
and the baseball stuff -

18:04.015 --> 18:06.116
And this girl comes in,
tries to run things.

18:06.117 --> 18:08.518
You know, you've been running it
for quite a while and made a big
success out of it.

18:08.519 --> 18:11.055
But this little red-headed
little...

18:11.056 --> 18:14.324
You know, little nice
little girl, she comes in

18:14.325 --> 18:18.962
And takes over.
What do you do?

18:18.963 --> 18:21.331
I tell mommy.

18:22.533 --> 18:25.035
But mommy's
not home, is she?

18:25.036 --> 18:29.472
And so the girl takes over
your bubblegum factory.

18:29.473 --> 18:33.610
You know, it's just
the way life is, mark.
Yeah.

18:33.611 --> 18:36.180
Can I go play now?

18:36.181 --> 18:39.449
Yeah, go play.
I'll fix dinner.

18:39.450 --> 18:41.551
Hi, honey.

18:41.552 --> 18:46.123
Oh, tim!
I am so good.

18:46.124 --> 18:49.927
I had the best first day.

18:49.928 --> 18:53.197
I mean, I didn't get lost.
I didn't screw anything up.

18:53.198 --> 18:55.332
Not one person yelled at me.

18:55.333 --> 18:58.168
And get this, get this.
Look at this. Check it out.

18:58.169 --> 19:01.805
My own electronic
security card.

19:01.806 --> 19:05.008
I mean, I think I may even
hold on to this job longer
than a week.

19:05.009 --> 19:07.544
You know, this is great.
I'm so proud of you, hon.

19:07.545 --> 19:09.279
What's the matter with you?
You're limping.

19:09.280 --> 19:12.783
I fell through a roof.
What?

19:12.784 --> 19:14.451
Yeah, right through
the subfloor.

19:14.452 --> 19:17.287
Luckily the basement
broke my fall.

19:21.459 --> 19:23.761
Oh, honey,
are you all right?

19:23.762 --> 19:27.497
Yeah, my leg's ok.
It's my life that's wrecked.

19:27.498 --> 19:30.868
What do you mean?
Everything seems to
be changing for me.

19:30.869 --> 19:35.739
You went to work.
Wilson's taking a bath.
Al looks like don ho.

19:35.740 --> 19:38.041
Now, wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

19:38.042 --> 19:39.977
I told you
this yesterday.

19:39.978 --> 19:42.846
Binford went and
got married to a model

19:42.847 --> 19:47.117
And left the whole
<i>tool time</i> thing in charge
of his daughter maureen.

19:47.118 --> 19:49.552
So, she's got... Mm.

19:49.553 --> 19:52.990
She's got everybody working
against me - al, the crew.

19:52.991 --> 19:54.691
This woman's trying
to take over <i>tool time.</i>

19:54.692 --> 19:58.028
Well, she can't do that. I mean,
you spent the last three years

19:58.029 --> 20:00.063
Making <i>tool time</i> a success.
That's right.

20:00.064 --> 20:03.333
You're the only reason
anybody watches that show.
That's right.

20:03.334 --> 20:07.570
Well, who the hell
does she think she is?
Maureen binford.

20:07.571 --> 20:08.872
Wait a minute.

20:08.873 --> 20:12.475
Is she the one that always
comes to the Halloween party

20:12.476 --> 20:16.513
Dressed like a hacksaw?
Hacksaw, yeah.

20:16.514 --> 20:20.951
Little red-headed thing,
about this big?

20:20.952 --> 20:22.752
Yeah.

20:22.753 --> 20:24.654
I can take her.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.897
Jill.
I've got 40 pounds
on her.

20:33.898 --> 20:36.533
I'm gonna hunt her down.

20:36.534 --> 20:37.868
Honey.
Hey!

20:37.869 --> 20:41.071
She messes with you,
she messes with me.

20:42.941 --> 20:46.476
I... Maybe I'm wrong,
but I think we're overreacting.

20:46.477 --> 20:48.545
I don't think you
gotta hurt the woman.

20:48.546 --> 20:50.280
You think so?

20:50.281 --> 20:53.683
But the fact that you think like
this makes me feel a lot better.

20:53.684 --> 20:55.552
Really?
Really.

20:55.553 --> 20:58.155
You know, lefty,
you're one great broad.

20:58.156 --> 21:03.060
You're not such a bad mug
yourself, you big palooka.

21:03.061 --> 21:05.095
You know, I got
a better idea.
What?

21:05.096 --> 21:08.798
I think I can outsmart her.
Use my brain.

21:08.799 --> 21:11.634
Aw, come on.
Let me beat her up.

21:20.311 --> 21:21.912
Tim.

21:23.214 --> 21:24.748
Tim.

21:27.151 --> 21:30.954
I think you're being
a gloomy gus again.

21:30.955 --> 21:32.822
Is that what you think, al?

21:32.823 --> 21:36.393
I just think maureen is trying
to make this show better.

21:36.394 --> 21:39.997
Really? Is this what
you call better?

21:39.998 --> 21:43.633
What's next? Grass skirts,
hula hoops? Roller skates,
dollhouses?

21:43.634 --> 21:46.937
Well, whatever
the boss wants.
She's not the boss.

21:46.938 --> 21:49.539
I'll tell you something else.
I think I outsmarted her.

21:49.540 --> 21:52.309
We won't be seeing her for
about a week 'cause I sent
her on this promotional buy.

21:52.310 --> 21:54.444
She's gonna sell our
sweatshirts, t-shirts, pins,
that sort of stuff.

21:54.445 --> 21:55.913
Hi, guys.
Hi, boss.

21:55.914 --> 21:58.248
How are my two stars?
We're fine.

21:58.249 --> 22:01.684
Tim, I'm leaving
for chicago.
Really?

22:01.685 --> 22:03.520
Yeah, I went
with your concept,

22:03.521 --> 22:06.823
And I'm gonna be pushing
our sweatshirt line at
the hardware show.

22:06.824 --> 22:09.226
I'm gonna be gone
about a week.
We're gonna miss you.

22:09.227 --> 22:11.328
Thanks.
Toodles.

22:11.329 --> 22:13.163
Oh, listen, I almost forgot.

22:13.164 --> 22:15.065
Here are a couple
of samples.
Oh, good. Thanks.

22:15.066 --> 22:17.467
Bye.
Bye.

22:17.468 --> 22:21.238
She bit on the bait
just like a dumb bass.

22:25.076 --> 22:26.944
She won't be around here
for a week.

22:26.945 --> 22:30.814
And now you tell me who's boss
here at <i>tool time,</i> buddy.

22:38.856 --> 22:40.723
Good luck, honey.
Good luck.

22:40.724 --> 22:42.926
Oh, I can't believe it.
I'm wishing you luck,
you're wishing me luck.

22:42.927 --> 22:44.794
Go on, you're late.
