01:17.835 --> 01:20.379
Think she'll get over thisaway?

01:23.925 --> 01:25.760
Might.

01:25.802 --> 01:27.929
Best bed them down.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.028
Come on, Tig.

03:05.153 --> 03:07.155
There she goes.

03:12.077 --> 03:14.288
Looks like we're in for it.

03:32.890 --> 03:34.558
You see them?

03:37.604 --> 03:41.232
Can't see them.
Can't hear them.

03:41.273 --> 03:43.734
You ever seen one this bad?

03:43.777 --> 03:46.321
Not since Noah and the flood.

03:46.403 --> 03:51.117
Well, you should know, Boss,
since you was there.

03:51.158 --> 03:53.245
What did you say?

03:53.327 --> 03:57.249
He said, "You should know
since you was there. "

04:02.838 --> 04:05.715
Well, even that
wasn't this damn wet.

04:05.799 --> 04:07.217
One thing's certain.

04:07.300 --> 04:12.305
Noah never shoveled as much bull
from them he had aboard.

04:12.389 --> 04:15.308
Let's rustle up some grub.

04:15.392 --> 04:17.351
Mose?

04:17.435 --> 04:18.937
Hey!

04:21.482 --> 04:23.108
- That hurt?
- Yeah.

04:23.150 --> 04:25.194
Mose, still got them cards?

04:25.277 --> 04:27.279
Yeah, I got them.

04:27.363 --> 04:30.740
Get them out, and let's have us
a game after breakfast.

04:43.421 --> 04:44.714
Button!

04:46.382 --> 04:48.301
Pull them plates under here.

04:51.429 --> 04:55.558
You gonna play them cards, Mose,
or stare a hole through them?

04:55.641 --> 04:57.768
Don't rush me.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.399
I'll take four.

05:03.484 --> 05:06.527
Oh, for pity's sakes.
"Take four. "

05:13.076 --> 05:16.371
All right, that's it.

05:16.413 --> 05:17.706
I'm out.

05:19.081 --> 05:20.751
Me too.

05:26.006 --> 05:29.051
A man's trust
is a valuable thing, Button.

05:29.134 --> 05:32.179
You don't want to lose it
for a handful of cards.

06:29.655 --> 06:32.740
Well, at least it ain't raining.

06:34.535 --> 06:37.912
Get yourself dressed, Button.
Help Mose get things cleaned up.

06:37.954 --> 06:41.584
Then you walk out
and look for them horses.

06:54.471 --> 06:57.850
Looks like you could use
a little muscle there, Charley.

07:01.812 --> 07:05.149
You just keep on like you are.

07:05.232 --> 07:08.402
You'll get your chance
soon enough.

07:13.365 --> 07:16.161
No need to ask
for more chores, Mose.

07:16.243 --> 07:18.370
Every man's got to pull
his weight.

07:18.455 --> 07:21.583
Yeah, but my weight
is half of yours.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.798
You know, it's hard to figure
Charley sometimes.

07:28.839 --> 07:31.218
I ain't even sure
if he likes me.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.302
He likes you.

07:34.387 --> 07:39.851
You know, Boss had some pause
about hiring me on.

07:39.893 --> 07:43.939
Too big to get around on horses
and work them cows.

07:44.022 --> 07:46.733
Afraid I'd eat too much.

07:46.816 --> 07:48.693
It was Charley
that talked him into it,

07:48.777 --> 07:51.196
and I ain't one to take
a man's confidence lightly.

07:51.279 --> 07:52.489
You know I ain't, either.

07:52.532 --> 07:55.409
I know you ain't, but it's best
to keep remembering it

07:55.492 --> 07:56.994
if you want respect

07:57.035 --> 08:00.164
when you're riding with men
like Charley and Boss.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.698
Button, pull.

08:33.905 --> 08:35.116
Pull it.

08:35.198 --> 08:37.368
Button!

08:37.410 --> 08:38.703
Button!

08:38.744 --> 08:42.373
Quit playing with that dog
and pull the wagon!

08:47.754 --> 08:49.297
Pull it!

08:55.220 --> 08:58.056
- Pull!
- Oh, yeah!

08:58.098 --> 09:00.809
Yeah.
That's it.

09:11.278 --> 09:13.363
Hey, hey!
Look at that!

09:45.021 --> 09:47.732
Old Boss sure can cowboy,
can't he?

09:48.858 --> 09:50.318
Yeah.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.696
Broke the mold after him.

10:07.001 --> 10:08.921
Main bunch is working
towards water.

10:09.003 --> 10:10.755
We'll go up-country,
find the rest,

10:10.839 --> 10:12.590
and we'll push them there.

10:15.009 --> 10:16.846
Look at that.

10:18.848 --> 10:21.433
A couple of damn kids.

10:21.517 --> 10:22.810
Anyway, once we get them,

10:22.852 --> 10:25.855
we can start driving them back
closer to camp.

10:25.937 --> 10:28.399
It'll be a while
before we see another town.

10:28.482 --> 10:31.151
Could use supplies,
coffee and such.

10:32.319 --> 10:33.404
Mose!

10:33.487 --> 10:35.030
Ow!

10:35.114 --> 10:36.532
Mose!

10:41.287 --> 10:44.290
You'll have to ride back
to that town we passed.

10:44.373 --> 10:46.125
When you want me to go?

10:46.209 --> 10:48.044
Tonight.

10:48.127 --> 10:50.088
I'll go.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.339
I can go.

10:51.381 --> 10:54.092
How long you figure, Charley?

10:54.175 --> 10:57.429
Without cows slowing things,
maybe one day there, one back.

10:57.512 --> 10:59.054
Sounds about right.

10:59.139 --> 11:00.347
Come on, Boss.

11:00.390 --> 11:01.558
I can do it.

11:01.640 --> 11:03.185
Sure you can, boy.

11:03.268 --> 11:04.810
Just don't know
if that town's ready

11:04.895 --> 11:08.023
to have you
turned loose on it just yet.

11:09.316 --> 11:10.650
English!

11:10.734 --> 11:12.360
Damn! Shit!

11:12.444 --> 11:14.070
Bullshit!

12:27.646 --> 12:30.482
By God, if you're gonna pick
your feet like a monkey,

12:30.524 --> 12:32.734
you do it downwind.

12:35.654 --> 12:38.991
Swear to God, old Tig
takes better care of herself.

12:40.409 --> 12:41.660
Starting to think
it was a mistake

12:41.743 --> 12:43.954
not getting you on in some town
to learn a trade.

12:43.996 --> 12:46.499
I don't like towns.
Never liked them.

12:46.540 --> 12:49.210
Oh, you're just saying that
'cause you heard me say it.

12:49.293 --> 12:51.253
Get yourself a trade
and set up in a town.

12:51.336 --> 12:53.213
You'll always have
a roof over your head,

12:53.297 --> 12:54.382
a bed up off the ground,

12:54.464 --> 12:57.467
and food no further away
than a cafÃ©.

12:58.218 --> 13:00.263
Ain't that so, Charley?

13:03.223 --> 13:04.601
That was a big help.

13:04.683 --> 13:06.853
Might as well be talking
to this horse.

13:07.854 --> 13:10.648
Put your boot on, Button.
Let's go to work.

13:13.318 --> 13:16.362
Course, if you was to live
in a town...

13:17.530 --> 13:19.740
You'd have to clean up some.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.328
Otherwise, no one
could stand the stink.

13:33.505 --> 13:35.882
What you do that for?!

13:42.306 --> 13:44.516
Cheating at cards.

13:50.773 --> 13:52.024
Cheating.

13:52.106 --> 13:54.275
I apologized to you for that!

13:55.402 --> 13:58.280
Eh, Boss?
I apologized to him for that.

13:58.364 --> 14:00.991
Evidently he ain't over it yet.

14:20.386 --> 14:23.055
It's getting dark, Boss.

14:23.139 --> 14:26.642
He could have got hurt
between that town and the camp.

14:26.726 --> 14:29.103
Probably just taking his time.

14:29.144 --> 14:31.981
Don't suppose he got into
a poker game, do you?

14:32.065 --> 14:35.276
Wouldn't gamble
your money, Boss.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.989
What if he's lying out there
waiting for us to come along?

14:39.072 --> 14:42.784
We'd never find him tonight.
Now, come on down from there.

14:42.868 --> 14:44.618
He's worried.

14:44.703 --> 14:46.872
- You worried?
- Yeah, I'm worried.

14:46.955 --> 14:50.668
Been worried since yesterday.
Should have sent me.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.836
Mose can look out for himself.

14:52.919 --> 14:54.921
Then why ain't he here with us?

14:54.963 --> 14:57.842
Well, you never was
wanting to go to towns.

14:57.924 --> 15:00.260
Well, I don't want to go now
neither.

15:00.303 --> 15:03.181
But we better find him,
wherever he is.

15:06.224 --> 15:07.894
All right.

15:07.976 --> 15:11.189
You and me strike out early.
Button can watch the outfit.

15:11.271 --> 15:15.526
Button, come on down from there
and get supper a-working.

15:26.287 --> 15:28.956
Most likely be back
before suppertime.

15:28.998 --> 15:30.958
But three sets of eyes,
it's better than two.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.086
- You stay with the wagon.
- Come on, Boss.

15:34.170 --> 15:35.421
No one is gonna bother it.

15:35.505 --> 15:38.591
We haven't seen a single person
since we set up the camp.

15:38.674 --> 15:41.761
I always feel better
if someone's close around.

15:41.844 --> 15:45.723
You been working hard,
deserve a little loafing time.

15:45.806 --> 15:47.683
Stay right here.

15:50.728 --> 15:52.189
Stay, Tig.

15:52.271 --> 15:53.357
Wants to go.

15:53.439 --> 15:56.025
She acts like she does,
but she don't.

15:56.109 --> 15:59.780
Still got the heart,
not the legs.

16:01.030 --> 16:03.534
You keep that rifle close.

17:14.271 --> 17:18.068
Always liked me a sidearm
with some heft.

17:18.109 --> 17:21.905
Took this off a man who couldn't
pay all he owed for some cows.

17:21.946 --> 17:23.781
Damn fine weapon.

17:25.284 --> 17:28.329
Always noticed you favor
something light, don't you?

17:50.267 --> 17:53.604
Set it right down.
Thank you.

18:43.780 --> 18:45.157
Hello!

18:50.496 --> 18:52.956
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

18:53.040 --> 18:56.001
Like to feed and water them,
curry them down with saddles on.

18:56.085 --> 18:59.172
Okay, that'll be four bits each.

18:59.213 --> 19:01.674
- There you go.
- Thank you.

19:02.633 --> 19:04.135
Not planning on staying long?

19:04.218 --> 19:06.429
Long as it takes to find
who we're looking for.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.598
Maybe I can help you gents.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.017
I been here since Harmonville
was Fort Harmon

19:11.058 --> 19:13.228
and we still had soldiers
to chase off Indians.

19:13.311 --> 19:16.939
I know everybody in town
and for miles beyond.

19:17.023 --> 19:21.027
Big man needing a haircut,
about 30.

19:21.111 --> 19:23.362
That's his rig right there.

19:27.366 --> 19:30.703
Oh, yeah.
Know who you're talking about.

19:30.746 --> 19:32.413
Very friendly young fella.

19:32.498 --> 19:35.375
Looks like he's been living out
of saddlebags most of his life.

19:35.416 --> 19:37.418
Got his horse in the corral.

19:37.503 --> 19:38.921
Ride with you, does he?

19:38.962 --> 19:40.756
Know where we can find him?

19:40.839 --> 19:42.257
Yeah.

19:42.299 --> 19:44.051
Yeah, he's up in the jailhouse.

19:44.092 --> 19:47.221
He got into it
with some cattlemen

19:47.304 --> 19:48.597
over at the general store.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.349
- Some cattlemen.
- Yeah.

19:50.432 --> 19:52.059
Busted them up pretty bad, too,

19:52.142 --> 19:54.019
before Marshal Poole came up

19:54.102 --> 19:56.230
and hit him over the head
with his gun barrel.

19:56.271 --> 19:59.733
Yeah, he's lucky he
didn't get shot in the back.

19:59.775 --> 20:01.818
You might want to keep that
in mind

20:01.902 --> 20:03.946
when you're talking
to Marshal Poole.

20:04.029 --> 20:05.822
Saddle his horse.

20:05.906 --> 20:07.199
That cover what he owes?

20:07.283 --> 20:08.451
Oh, yeah.

20:08.534 --> 20:11.454
Name's Percy if you should need
anything else.

20:11.496 --> 20:12.955
Much obliged.

20:13.039 --> 20:14.581
Hold on.

20:25.134 --> 20:26.845
How long you had him here?

20:26.928 --> 20:29.931
I brought him in here
yesterday afternoon.

20:30.014 --> 20:32.433
It wasn't easy
getting him into the cell.

20:32.475 --> 20:33.601
Why is that?

20:33.643 --> 20:36.354
Goddamn bear.
Size of it.

20:38.606 --> 20:42.485
Evening.
Name's Boss Spearman.

20:42.527 --> 20:44.572
This here's Charley Waite.

20:44.654 --> 20:46.282
Evening.

20:46.866 --> 20:48.408
Believe you have
a friend of ours.

20:48.491 --> 20:51.661
Name's Mose Harrison.

20:51.745 --> 20:53.705
Yeah, I got him here.

20:53.789 --> 20:57.793
He started a fight
in the general store.

20:57.876 --> 21:01.714
Mose don't start fights,
just finishes them.

21:01.797 --> 21:05.176
I just said he started it.
You said he didn't.

21:05.217 --> 21:06.677
Maybe you're calling me a liar.

21:06.719 --> 21:08.554
You got a charge against him?

21:08.636 --> 21:10.389
I got plenty.

21:10.472 --> 21:13.516
Inciting a fight.
Disturbing the peace.

21:13.601 --> 21:16.396
Creating a public nuisance.
Take your pick.

21:16.478 --> 21:18.355
Hear tell he got hit
over the head.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.651
He'll be fine.

21:22.693 --> 21:25.362
Well, I come to get him.

21:25.447 --> 21:30.202
Well, you pay the fines,
and you can have him.

21:30.284 --> 21:35.207
How does $50 each offense sound?

21:35.247 --> 21:37.209
Like robbery.

21:40.044 --> 21:41.754
Lot of money.

21:41.838 --> 21:44.508
Oh, yes, a lot of money.

21:45.383 --> 21:47.927
I been waiting for you,
Mr. Spearman.

21:48.011 --> 21:50.680
My name's Denton Baxter.

21:50.764 --> 21:52.599
Be your men Mose tussled with.

21:52.682 --> 21:54.351
That's right.

21:54.434 --> 21:57.062
You know, folks
in Fort Harmon country

21:57.145 --> 22:00.774
don't take to free grazers
or free grazing.

22:00.858 --> 22:03.944
They hate them more than they
used to hate the Indians.

22:04.027 --> 22:08.032
I expect by "folks,"
you mean ranchers like yourself.

22:09.866 --> 22:12.036
I got the biggest spread around.

22:12.078 --> 22:14.205
Bigger than any three or four
put together.

22:14.287 --> 22:16.374
Built it up with me own
two hands,

22:16.414 --> 22:18.251
piece by piece,

22:18.291 --> 22:20.627
along with this town.

22:20.710 --> 22:22.380
And there ain't no
free-graze cattle

22:22.462 --> 22:25.173
gonna take the feed
off my cattle on this range.

22:25.258 --> 22:26.884
Free graze is legal.

22:26.925 --> 22:29.178
Times change, Mr. Spearman.

22:29.262 --> 22:33.266
Most folks change with them.
A few holdouts never do.

22:35.392 --> 22:36.602
You know, a few years back,

22:36.685 --> 22:39.397
a free-graze outfit
came through.

22:39.438 --> 22:42.525
One night,
the cattle got stampeded,

22:42.608 --> 22:45.820
the wagons caught on fire,
and one of those boys

22:45.903 --> 22:48.781
was shot off his horse
in the middle of it all.

22:48.865 --> 22:51.201
Shot in the back, was he?

22:55.705 --> 22:59.501
Your man's horse and rig
are at the livery barn.

22:59.584 --> 23:02.087
You can take him with you
when you leave tonight.

23:02.170 --> 23:04.715
And come sunrise,
you hitch up your wagon

23:04.798 --> 23:06.884
and get your damn
free-graze cattle moving

23:06.967 --> 23:10.636
and keep them moving till you're
out of Fort Harmon country!

23:11.804 --> 23:14.558
Now, you let Mr. Spearman
fetch his man

23:14.641 --> 23:17.060
so he can be on his way.

23:36.413 --> 23:38.457
Charley.

23:43.170 --> 23:44.755
- Mose.

23:44.839 --> 23:47.300
Mose.

23:50.636 --> 23:54.265
Looks like someone's put the
boots to him after he was down.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.682
Does it?

24:01.189 --> 24:03.191
Mose, you gotta get up.

24:03.233 --> 24:07.529
Charley, I'm glad to see you.

24:08.821 --> 24:10.865
I don't much like this town.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.496
Here you go.

24:17.121 --> 24:19.542
Boy, they really lit into him.

24:19.582 --> 24:21.042
You got a doctor in this town?

24:21.085 --> 24:23.128
Yeah.
Doc Barlow.

24:23.211 --> 24:25.673
It's the house up behind
the barn by the church.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.424
Look for a picket fence.

24:27.507 --> 24:30.010
He's got a sign out front.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.848
Oh, my.
Bring him right in.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.106
Lay him down in there.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.451
I'll fetch the doctor.

24:54.535 --> 24:57.037
Get his legs, Boss.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.914
Easy, easy.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.293
Good.

25:09.301 --> 25:10.760
I'm Dr. Barlow.

25:10.844 --> 25:12.678
Boss Spearman.

25:13.804 --> 25:15.015
Charley Waite.

25:15.097 --> 25:16.766
Patient there's Mose Harrison.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.393
He works for me.

25:18.476 --> 25:19.936
These wounds are old.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.980
Easier to treat
if you bring him in right away.

25:22.063 --> 25:25.316
Your marshal had him, and he
don't keep a friendly jail.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.069
This is the man who was in the
fight with Dent Baxter's men?

25:28.153 --> 25:30.906
He certainly gave
as good as he got.

25:30.947 --> 25:33.074
Broke the arm of one.

25:33.116 --> 25:36.078
Knowing them,
they had it coming, I expect.

25:37.162 --> 25:38.622
Let's see what we got here.

25:38.664 --> 25:40.081
- Aah!
- Easy.

25:40.124 --> 25:42.334
- Easy, Mose.
- Easy, Mr. Harrison.

25:42.418 --> 25:44.336
Nobody's trying to hurt you
on purpose.

25:44.420 --> 25:46.422
I'd say you got a couple
of broken ribs.

25:46.505 --> 25:49.425
Gonna need to get
this shirt off.

25:58.768 --> 26:02.688
Sue, I am gonna need some soap,
some water, and some alcohol.

26:09.403 --> 26:12.406
I want you to drink this,
Mr. Harrison.

26:12.490 --> 26:14.867
- That's it.

26:17.870 --> 26:19.957
Let's clean up these cuts
on his face.

26:19.997 --> 26:23.376
He's got a nice gash
in his scalp there.

26:23.459 --> 26:24.711
I'd say to good health,

26:24.794 --> 26:26.713
but then I'd probably be out
of business.

26:26.796 --> 26:31.509
We'll drink to good health
for them that have it coming.

26:34.846 --> 26:37.057
The two of you
can wait in the parlor.

26:50.320 --> 26:51.989
Be better he didn't travel.

26:52.071 --> 26:54.616
Well, he'll have to.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.828
How much I owe you, Doctor?

26:57.870 --> 26:58.871
We're even.

26:58.954 --> 27:01.999
I figured I made enough off the
damage he did to Baxter's men.

27:02.082 --> 27:04.543
Wish he'd have made you wealthy.

27:06.044 --> 27:07.212
Ma'am.

27:35.283 --> 27:38.077
Doc Barlow's got him
a pretty wife.

27:38.161 --> 27:40.079
Notice that, did you?

27:40.121 --> 27:41.873
Well, I ain't dead.

27:41.956 --> 27:43.499
Glad to hear it.

27:43.583 --> 27:44.710
Sweet, too.

27:44.751 --> 27:48.129
Treated us as good as anybody.
That's a real lady.

27:48.213 --> 27:50.007
A woman like that makes a man

27:50.089 --> 27:53.928
think about
setting down roots, eh?

27:55.303 --> 27:57.473
Doc looks like a real
hardworking feller.

27:57.555 --> 28:01.060
Probably working away on making
some little ones, too.

28:01.101 --> 28:03.186
Creates quite a picture,
now, don't it?

28:03.270 --> 28:04.396
Yeah.

28:04.437 --> 28:07.065
Heard they're worth
a thousand words.

28:29.129 --> 28:30.798
Hey, Tig.

28:40.182 --> 28:42.561
Now, where do you suppose he is?

28:58.994 --> 29:01.329
Goddamn kid.

29:03.456 --> 29:05.500
Button's all right, Boss.

29:08.712 --> 29:11.965
Anyone done him harm, they'd
have gone through the wagon.

29:12.049 --> 29:14.968
Reckon you're right.

29:18.972 --> 29:20.849
Here he is.

29:21.766 --> 29:23.811
If you're awake,
you might want to see this.

29:23.853 --> 29:25.896
- Where you been?!
- I seen it before.

29:25.980 --> 29:27.982
Out with the herd.

29:28.024 --> 29:30.443
I thought I told you
to stay with the wagon.

29:30.526 --> 29:32.612
- What happened to Mose?
- Did you hear what I said?!

29:32.695 --> 29:34.864
Yeah, but what happened?

29:34.946 --> 29:38.326
Run into a little trouble
in that town.

29:38.367 --> 29:41.287
Looks like more than a little.

29:41.370 --> 29:43.122
Are we moving on?

29:43.206 --> 29:46.792
We always do, don't we,
once we've grazed off a place?

29:55.219 --> 29:56.844
Did I do something wrong?

29:56.929 --> 29:58.931
Just leave him be for a while.

29:59.013 --> 30:01.349
Here.
Have some coffee.

30:01.391 --> 30:03.601
Made fresh, for a change.

30:03.685 --> 30:07.063
There was three riders scouting
up the herd this morning.

30:07.105 --> 30:08.356
Where?

30:08.440 --> 30:10.317
Maybe half a mile out.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.236
Just sitting there,
looking at the cattle.

30:23.622 --> 30:25.581
Same ones?

30:25.624 --> 30:28.001
Four this time.

30:28.085 --> 30:29.878
Country's filling up.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.005
Maybe we should push on.

30:32.089 --> 30:33.715
Do no good, Button.

30:33.799 --> 30:35.343
I seen them like Baxter before.

30:35.425 --> 30:38.971
He means to have this herd
or scatter it to the wind.

30:39.054 --> 30:40.889
If he was gonna take the herd,

30:40.932 --> 30:42.933
why not just keep you in town?

30:43.016 --> 30:45.395
Marshal already had Mose.

30:45.435 --> 30:48.273
Wants us all in one place.

30:48.355 --> 30:50.567
Far from there when it happens.

30:50.607 --> 30:54.279
Don't make no sense, him telling
us to move on and all.

30:54.361 --> 30:57.073
Weren't the only thing he said.

30:57.156 --> 30:59.576
Most time, a man will tell you
his bad intentions

30:59.617 --> 31:03.538
if you listen,
let yourself hear.

31:03.621 --> 31:07.709
A few years back, a free-graze
outfit come through.

31:07.792 --> 31:10.587
That weren't no idle story.

31:10.628 --> 31:12.672
Let's find out for certain.

32:06.185 --> 32:07.854
Beautiful country.

32:09.104 --> 32:11.649
A man can get lost out here,

32:11.733 --> 32:15.694
forget there's people and things
that ain't so simple as this.

32:17.656 --> 32:20.242
How long we been
riding together, Charley?

32:21.201 --> 32:23.245
Nigh on 10 years.

32:23.328 --> 32:25.454
Mm-hmm.

32:25.539 --> 32:28.917
You know what they call that,
call it a decade.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.253
Long time.

32:31.335 --> 32:34.005
Been a lot of change since then.

32:35.715 --> 32:37.842
What's on your mind, Boss?

32:39.177 --> 32:41.763
Way I figure it, we can leave
the cattle and run,

32:41.847 --> 32:44.267
or you and me can go in the dark
and stop them

32:44.349 --> 32:46.685
before they scatter the herd.

32:50.522 --> 32:54.776
You reckon them cows are worth
getting killed over?

32:54.860 --> 32:56.236
The cows is one thing.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.821
But one man telling another

32:57.905 --> 33:01.575
where he can go in this
country's something else.

33:01.659 --> 33:03.577
That rancher sat
in that jailhouse,

33:03.619 --> 33:06.037
sneering and letting
his lawman lay down the law

33:06.080 --> 33:08.583
till he figured
it was time to show us

33:08.624 --> 33:10.960
that he gave the orders
around here.

33:11.042 --> 33:14.380
Ooh, sticks in my craw.

33:18.759 --> 33:21.721
Well, we sure as hell owe them
for what they done to Mose.

33:21.762 --> 33:23.055
Yeah.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.853
I'll saddle the horses.

33:33.065 --> 33:35.401
You two keep a sharp eye out.

33:36.527 --> 33:39.948
Got the scatter-gun.
We'll be watching for them.

33:40.032 --> 33:42.326
You'll want to douse that fire.

33:42.408 --> 33:43.743
Button, keep to the wagon.

33:43.785 --> 33:45.995
I don't want to see you
out in the open.

33:46.079 --> 33:47.580
Okay?

33:52.377 --> 33:54.921
I got some sugar in that town.

33:56.673 --> 33:58.592
It's in the wagon.

34:15.525 --> 34:17.652
I wouldn't want to have him
coming down on me

34:17.735 --> 34:19.446
like these cowboys.

34:19.489 --> 34:21.491
What the hell's the matter
with you, Gus?

34:21.572 --> 34:24.494
You're twitching all damn night.

34:24.536 --> 34:29.373
Damn back's so sore from being
flung into that stove.

34:30.456 --> 34:34.295
Feel like I been humped
by a 300-pound whore.

34:35.255 --> 34:37.672
Well, Gus, I'd say
you got off easy.

34:37.757 --> 34:39.717
Look at my face.

34:42.053 --> 34:45.639
Well, you can bet Butler will
square things with that big man

34:45.681 --> 34:48.476
for breaking his arm and all.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.812
Did you hear it snap?

34:52.146 --> 34:53.773
I heard it snap.

34:53.857 --> 34:56.150
Lucky for him he shoots
with either hand.

34:58.152 --> 35:00.822
One twitch, and you're in hell!

35:00.864 --> 35:03.492
Now, get on your feet,
all of you!

35:05.703 --> 35:08.329
Now, throw them guns
on the ground.

35:12.917 --> 35:14.962
I ain't a-gonna say it again.

35:20.467 --> 35:22.636
And kick them away.

35:30.853 --> 35:33.439
Which one of you's got
a sore back?

35:35.065 --> 35:36.817
Which one?

35:36.902 --> 35:38.861
Him.

35:39.779 --> 35:41.948
- You're Gus?
- Yeah.

35:42.031 --> 35:44.033
Ought not gang up on a man
three-to-one.

35:44.075 --> 35:45.034
Ohh!

35:45.076 --> 35:46.703
Wait a minute, mister.

35:46.786 --> 35:49.539
- It wasn't our idea to jump him.
- Shut up, Wylie.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.624
Get up, you son of a bitch.

35:51.708 --> 35:54.961
- What's your name?
- Vince.

35:55.045 --> 35:58.590
Mighty nice tie-down you got.
You're a gunhand, are you?

35:58.672 --> 36:00.300
- You fast?
- No.

36:00.382 --> 36:01.885
Uh-huh.

36:01.927 --> 36:05.096
How many riders does he have?

36:05.180 --> 36:08.099
I said, how many riders?

36:08.183 --> 36:11.018
The rest are on their way
to your wagon.

36:13.480 --> 36:16.107
Uhh! Aah!

36:16.192 --> 36:18.818
You want to smile now, go ahead.

36:18.902 --> 36:20.947
Be a while before he's of use.

36:21.029 --> 36:24.659
Charley, throw me
them saddlebags.

36:32.124 --> 36:33.917
Put your spook hats on.

36:36.128 --> 36:38.380
The ones in your belt,
put them on.

36:41.841 --> 36:44.595
Now get your britches off.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.850
Not taking my britches off
for nobody.

36:51.769 --> 36:53.771
You listen out
of your good ear now.

36:53.855 --> 36:55.314
Now, get them off!

37:02.154 --> 37:04.407
Pretty scary bunch, eh, Charley?

37:07.828 --> 37:10.621
Get belly-down, flat-out!

37:10.663 --> 37:12.206
Uhh!

37:12.291 --> 37:14.293
Get your peckers in the dirt.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.587
- Hyah! Hah!

37:16.669 --> 37:17.837
Hah!

37:18.922 --> 37:22.383
If I hear so much
as a twig break...

37:22.467 --> 37:25.387
I'll come back
and kill you all.

37:29.933 --> 37:31.893
Charley.

37:31.977 --> 37:33.645
Charley!

38:06.888 --> 38:09.057
No Tig come to meet us.

38:25.241 --> 38:29.369
Ooh.
The bastards.

38:29.452 --> 38:33.206
They shot the boy,
but he's alive.

38:34.123 --> 38:36.084
Is that Mose?

38:42.049 --> 38:43.550
He's dead.

38:44.551 --> 38:46.679
Shot him in the head.

38:53.184 --> 38:54.436
Charley?

38:59.649 --> 39:01.110
Charley?

39:04.029 --> 39:07.449
Charley, get the lantern
and the whiskey.

39:13.831 --> 39:15.916
Yeah.

39:17.376 --> 39:18.587
Come on, wake up.

39:18.669 --> 39:19.921
Charley.

39:20.922 --> 39:25.426
They shot him here and
cracked him in the head here.

39:25.510 --> 39:27.762
We'll have to dig
that bullet out.

39:33.935 --> 39:35.854
You done good, Boss.

39:39.441 --> 39:42.402
Him going in and out like that.

39:42.485 --> 39:45.989
I don't know.
He lost a lot of blood.

39:46.072 --> 39:48.783
A whack on the head
can make a man strange

39:48.867 --> 39:51.745
for the rest of his days.

39:51.828 --> 39:54.706
Well, you done all you can.

39:54.789 --> 39:57.375
He needs a doctor now.

39:58.336 --> 40:00.630
If Button lives through morning,

40:00.670 --> 40:03.006
you take him in the wagon
and move on.

40:05.133 --> 40:08.095
You just gonna sit out here
waiting with them cows?

40:08.178 --> 40:09.972
That's right.

40:11.306 --> 40:13.809
And I'm gonna kill
every son of a bitch

40:13.851 --> 40:16.186
that comes to take them.

40:17.688 --> 40:19.106
For one man on open ground,

40:19.190 --> 40:21.734
you sure got a lot
of killing in mind.

40:34.956 --> 40:37.876
You know I never
gone against you, Boss.

40:37.959 --> 40:41.797
Always let you do
most of the talking.

40:41.879 --> 40:44.216
But he needs that doctor
back in that town,

40:44.298 --> 40:46.759
and I aim to take him.

40:46.842 --> 40:48.844
If you want to come,
we'll go together.

40:48.886 --> 40:54.017
Otherwise, you do what you
have to do, I'll do the same.

40:54.101 --> 40:57.104
You think they'll let you waltz
in there and waltz out?

40:57.187 --> 40:58.564
I don't figure into it.

40:58.605 --> 41:01.316
Button deserves every chance
we can give him.

41:05.695 --> 41:07.155
All right.

41:11.578 --> 41:14.538
But I aim to kill Baxter
and those that done this.

41:14.580 --> 41:17.624
And if that marshal gets in the
way, I'm gonna kill him, too.

41:17.708 --> 41:21.378
So you best get your mind right
about what's got to be done.

41:22.505 --> 41:25.549
I got no problem
with killing, Boss.

41:25.633 --> 41:27.134
Never have.

42:27.363 --> 42:29.572
Looks real nice, Charley.

42:30.865 --> 42:34.036
Yeah, a man ought to have
something to show he was here.

42:35.663 --> 42:38.415
Be gone in another big storm.

42:38.499 --> 42:41.043
Don't matter none.
He's got your dog for company.

42:41.126 --> 42:44.880
He'd like it you put
old Tig with him.

42:44.964 --> 42:47.299
Yeah, he was more
Mose's dog in the end

42:47.341 --> 42:49.343
than he was mine.

42:51.011 --> 42:54.473
Be right to say some words.

42:54.558 --> 42:57.143
You want to speak
with the man upstairs, do it.

42:57.184 --> 42:59.312
I'll stand right here
and listen,

42:59.353 --> 43:02.148
but I ain't talking
to that son of a bitch.

43:02.190 --> 43:03.608
And I'll be holding a grudge

43:03.691 --> 43:08.696
for him letting this befall
a sweet kid like Mose.

43:14.578 --> 43:17.664
Well, he sure as hell
wasn't one to complain.

43:19.040 --> 43:21.167
Woke with a smile.

43:21.210 --> 43:23.837
Seemed like he could keep it
there all day.

43:25.297 --> 43:27.716
Kind of man that'd say
"good morning" and mean it,

43:27.757 --> 43:29.718
whether it was or not.

43:31.011 --> 43:34.514
To tell you the truth, Lord,
if there was two gentler souls,

43:34.557 --> 43:36.349
I never seen them.

43:37.517 --> 43:41.022
Seemed like old Tig wouldn't
even kill birds in the end.

43:42.732 --> 43:45.567
Well, you got yourself
a good man and a good dog,

43:45.610 --> 43:47.236
and I'm inclined to agree
with Boss

43:47.320 --> 43:49.739
about holding a grudge
against you for it.

43:51.365 --> 43:53.367
I guess that means "amen. "

44:16.892 --> 44:18.809
God.

44:18.894 --> 44:20.811
Charley, you all right?

44:26.360 --> 44:27.903
I'm fine.

44:29.112 --> 44:30.948
Seems like you was, you know...

44:31.030 --> 44:32.908
I said I'm fine.

44:34.952 --> 44:37.829
Just got some old feelings
coming up.

44:39.248 --> 44:41.833
You know, we never asked
each other much.

44:41.917 --> 44:45.796
That's always been okay with me.
I figured it was okay with you.

44:45.837 --> 44:49.007
But you said some things
the last couple of days.

44:49.091 --> 44:54.096
Things that seemed like they had
kind of a history to them.

44:57.433 --> 44:58.350
Hey, Charley?

44:58.434 --> 45:00.852
Don't stand behind me, Boss.

45:24.836 --> 45:28.590
When I was a kid, a bunch of us
would go into the woods

45:28.673 --> 45:30.633
with our peashooters.

45:30.675 --> 45:34.387
Nothing fancy, just enough
to kill a bird or a squirrel,

45:34.470 --> 45:37.473
maybe something larger
if we was lucky.

45:39.142 --> 45:42.313
Killed my first man
in them woods.

45:42.395 --> 45:46.901
Held the paper on our farm,
and after my pa died,

45:46.983 --> 45:50.821
he'd come around to get payment
from my mom in any way he could.

45:51.947 --> 45:55.909
Weren't much older than Button
when I shot him in the throat.

45:57.369 --> 46:01.540
Knew there'd be more killing, so
I run off and joined the Army.

46:01.624 --> 46:04.083
War was on.

46:04.168 --> 46:06.669
They was only too happy
to have me.

46:08.422 --> 46:11.508
My first skirmish was like
hunting with my friends.

46:11.550 --> 46:15.846
We just sat up in some trees,
and they came marching at us.

46:16.889 --> 46:21.810
Must have been a hundred of them
dead after the smoke cleared.

46:21.895 --> 46:24.521
Went around and shot the rest
who weren't.

46:25.981 --> 46:29.236
Those of us with the knack
was made into a special squad

46:29.318 --> 46:31.780
so we could travel light
and on our own

46:31.862 --> 46:33.906
into enemy territory.

46:34.907 --> 46:39.620
Orders were pretty simple.
Make trouble wherever we could.

46:39.704 --> 46:43.791
With room like that, it wasn't
long before we was killing men

46:43.875 --> 46:46.211
that weren't even in uniform.

46:47.253 --> 46:50.257
Seemed like that went on
the rest of the war.

46:51.716 --> 46:54.344
After that, I come West.

46:55.303 --> 46:58.974
Lot of call for a man
with them skills.

46:59.057 --> 47:02.561
And I put them to work
for men just like Baxter.

47:07.607 --> 47:10.653
Every once in a while,
I almost get through a day

47:10.735 --> 47:15.366
without thinking
about who I am, what I'd done.

47:25.126 --> 47:27.169
He drifted off again.

47:27.252 --> 47:30.798
No better, but no worse, either.

47:30.882 --> 47:33.885
You're a real honest man,
Charley.

47:33.968 --> 47:36.012
Well, I ain't gonna lie
about Button.

47:36.095 --> 47:38.556
Not Button I'm talking about.

48:05.876 --> 48:07.920
- Mr. Spearman.
- The doctor in?

48:08.003 --> 48:09.463
No, he's not here.

48:09.545 --> 48:12.007
We got a boy that's hurt bad.

48:12.090 --> 48:15.009
Here, put him
in the examining room.

48:31.193 --> 48:32.820
It's not his hearing, ma'am.

48:32.861 --> 48:34.863
He hears real well
when he's awake.

48:34.905 --> 48:38.075
Mr. Spearman, I'm checking
if there's blood in his ears.

48:38.159 --> 48:40.661
It could mean a fractured skull.

48:43.998 --> 48:45.832
Are you the boy's father?

48:45.917 --> 48:47.210
No, ma'am.

48:47.293 --> 48:49.879
His name's Button,
and he works for me.

48:49.963 --> 48:53.883
It appears that's
not very healthy.

48:53.925 --> 48:57.845
You know the way to the parlor.
Sit down.

48:57.886 --> 48:59.514
I'll be a while.

49:21.745 --> 49:24.539
Well, I don't think
it's a fracture.

49:24.582 --> 49:27.918
Concussion's more likely,
but it's bad.

49:38.137 --> 49:41.307
I have to admit, we don't see
a lot of people shot.

49:41.390 --> 49:44.935
I cleaned and dressed the wound.
Doesn't look infected.

49:45.019 --> 49:46.646
What about the fever?

49:46.729 --> 49:50.733
He needs to lay still
and let his body do its work.

49:50.817 --> 49:53.360
No offense, ma'am,
but we come a long way

49:53.444 --> 49:57.656
to see that the boy gets looked
after proper by Dr. Barlow.

49:57.740 --> 49:58.992
Now, where's he at?

49:59.074 --> 50:00.577
One of Dent Baxter's hands

50:00.659 --> 50:02.661
came and fetched him
out to the ranch.

50:02.746 --> 50:06.208
Some men there had an accident
night before last.

50:11.087 --> 50:14.257
You must tell me what happened,
Mr. Spearman.

50:15.591 --> 50:17.636
Baxter sent his men
to stampede the herd,

50:17.719 --> 50:20.555
and I figured me and Charley
to stop them.

50:20.639 --> 50:23.850
Surprised them where they was
hiding, and we had at them.

50:23.934 --> 50:27.812
Them's the one Dr. Barlow's
putting back together.

50:27.896 --> 50:32.150
We got back to camp, others
had shot Mose in the head,

50:32.234 --> 50:34.361
shot Button, left him for dead.

50:34.444 --> 50:35.404
Oh.

50:38.782 --> 50:40.825
Shot our dog.

50:43.828 --> 50:45.331
I'll be getting money.

50:45.413 --> 50:47.999
It's not necessary.

50:48.084 --> 50:50.086
We pay our way, ma'am.

50:55.633 --> 50:58.511
Please, sit, Mr. Waite.

51:01.973 --> 51:04.850
Button.
Is that his real name?

51:05.685 --> 51:08.187
Please, sit.

51:09.897 --> 51:13.609
Yeah, it's the only one
we've known.

51:15.736 --> 51:17.990
He's just a boy.

51:18.991 --> 51:20.700
Yeah.

51:20.783 --> 51:23.620
Picked him up in a Texas town
a few years back,

51:23.703 --> 51:26.164
living off cafÃ© garbage.

51:26.206 --> 51:28.708
Couldn't speak a word
of English.

51:28.750 --> 51:31.544
Thought we was doing him
a favor.

51:31.628 --> 51:34.171
What about you?

51:34.965 --> 51:36.007
Hmm?

51:36.048 --> 51:38.342
You know that the marshal
works for Baxter.

51:38.427 --> 51:40.929
People saw you ride in.

51:42.890 --> 51:44.892
There's payment to be made
by them that done this.

51:44.975 --> 51:47.686
Don't intend to run.

51:50.564 --> 51:53.567
We could wire
for the federal marshal.

51:55.736 --> 51:59.281
If he started riding today,
he wouldn't make it for a week.

51:59.364 --> 52:02.367
With the storm coming,
maybe longer.

52:03.827 --> 52:07.749
We're obliged to deal with the
marshal and Baxter ourselves.

52:07.790 --> 52:09.833
What about Button?

52:12.086 --> 52:14.964
Well, he's fighting
for his life.

52:15.047 --> 52:16.298
We're gonna do the same.

52:22.972 --> 52:27.644
Whatever's needed for Button,
you do it.

52:27.727 --> 52:30.438
If he wakes, he's gonna need
to stay here a couple days

52:30.521 --> 52:32.982
so we can watch him.

52:33.066 --> 52:35.485
Whatever's best for him.

52:47.915 --> 52:51.335
Can't stay away from
my little paradise, gents?!

52:51.417 --> 52:54.629
Believe Satan says the same at
the gates of hell, old-timer!

52:56.756 --> 53:00.135
We'd like to put the horses up.
Had a tough trail.

53:00.218 --> 53:01.887
I'd like to set
the wagon yonder.

53:01.971 --> 53:04.557
Help yourself!
Hurry up, though!

53:04.639 --> 53:07.225
I seen it like this before!

53:07.309 --> 53:09.353
Big one's coming!

53:09.436 --> 53:11.730
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

54:15.587 --> 54:17.631
Son of a bitch.

54:25.222 --> 54:27.183
Sorry, Charley.

54:30.561 --> 54:31.771
Yeah.

54:47.411 --> 54:49.665
Jesus Christ.

54:53.834 --> 54:56.712
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!

55:01.009 --> 55:04.387
Maybe you should have built it
in another spot.

55:05.180 --> 55:07.724
Ah, mercy.

55:25.117 --> 55:27.619
Get the dog!

55:27.661 --> 55:29.621
Get the dog!

55:31.456 --> 55:32.749
Get the dog!

55:34.252 --> 55:37.045
It's a dog there, Charley.

55:46.930 --> 55:48.600
Take this.

55:50.976 --> 55:53.021
There he is.
Back here, Charley!

55:54.105 --> 55:55.439
To your left!
To your left!

55:55.481 --> 55:57.108
Get him!
Get him!

56:04.657 --> 56:06.284
You all right, Charley?

56:06.326 --> 56:10.205
Yeah, considering
I've just been swimming.

56:15.335 --> 56:17.295
I owe you, mister.

56:18.171 --> 56:20.132
That's a sweet pup
you got there.

56:20.173 --> 56:23.177
Remind you of anyone, Charley?

56:23.259 --> 56:25.094
Small version.

56:25.179 --> 56:26.971
Too small to be let out
in this weather.

56:27.056 --> 56:28.933
Belongs to my daughter.

56:29.016 --> 56:32.603
I tried to grab him, but
the water was too fast for me.

56:33.229 --> 56:35.481
If you're going into the cafÃ©,

56:35.563 --> 56:38.567
I'd be proud to buy you both
a cup of coffee.

56:41.903 --> 56:44.365
Coffee would be good about now.

56:50.204 --> 56:52.498
This is like the storm
that washed away Gunnison

56:52.581 --> 56:54.375
10, 12 years back.

56:54.458 --> 56:57.378
The water come down
from the mountains.

56:57.420 --> 57:00.131
Nowhere to go
but straight into town.

57:00.214 --> 57:02.341
- Killed a lot of folks.
- It's okay, Bill.

57:02.383 --> 57:05.052
Town's been here
a long time, Mack.

57:05.135 --> 57:06.763
It'll be here a lot longer.

57:06.845 --> 57:08.348
That's right, Papa.

57:08.430 --> 57:10.892
Every once in a while,
a good storm washes through

57:10.934 --> 57:15.188
and leaves her as clean
as a baby's bottom.

57:15.230 --> 57:17.774
Got to look
on the bright side, gents.

57:29.411 --> 57:31.621
Marshal.

57:31.705 --> 57:34.542
Meat and spuds, Les, as always.

57:37.210 --> 57:39.212
That should cover our meal.

57:40.590 --> 57:43.718
Worth a man's life to walk
across that road tonight.

57:43.800 --> 57:45.303
Thanks for the coffee.

57:45.385 --> 57:47.804
Well, appreciate what you done.

57:49.765 --> 57:52.684
That'll be two bits.

57:52.768 --> 57:54.228
Two bits.

58:15.708 --> 58:18.628
I'll be having words
with you two.

58:18.669 --> 58:22.215
And we'll be having more
than that with you, Marshal.

58:33.477 --> 58:37.231
No need to make
the cafÃ© messy... with folks.

58:37.313 --> 58:39.607
I've got a warrant sworn out
for your arrest

58:39.691 --> 58:41.401
for assaulting Baxter's men.

58:41.484 --> 58:43.611
We got a warrant sworn
for attempted murder

58:43.654 --> 58:45.155
for them that tried
to kill the boy

58:45.239 --> 58:47.532
who's laying over there
at the doc's.

58:47.616 --> 58:48.575
Swore out another one

58:48.658 --> 58:51.870
for them that murdered the big
fellow you had in your cell.

58:51.953 --> 58:53.705
Only ours ain't writ
by no tin star

58:53.789 --> 58:55.541
bought and paid for, Marshal.

58:55.624 --> 58:59.294
It's writ by us.
And we aim to enforce it.

58:59.378 --> 59:01.046
Is that so?

59:01.129 --> 59:04.341
We got no quarrel
with none of you folks.

59:04.424 --> 59:07.970
Baxter's men bushwhacked
our friend and shot him dead.

59:08.011 --> 59:10.223
Shot a 16-year-old boy, too.

59:10.305 --> 59:12.809
And clubbed him so hard...

59:14.352 --> 59:16.853
He might not live.

59:16.938 --> 59:19.691
Tried to take our cattle.

59:19.773 --> 59:22.986
Your marshal here ain't gonna do
nothing about it.

59:24.486 --> 59:27.615
You don't like free grazers
in this town.

59:27.699 --> 59:29.241
We don't much like being here.

59:29.325 --> 59:31.578
But a man's got a right
to protect his property

59:31.660 --> 59:33.162
and his life.

59:33.245 --> 59:38.042
And we ain't letting no rancher
or his lawman take either.

59:39.377 --> 59:42.088
We got no intention
of harming bystanders.

59:42.171 --> 59:43.798
Anyone who helps or comforts

59:43.883 --> 59:46.968
these goddamn lawbreaking
free grazers

59:47.052 --> 59:49.721
is gonna have to deal with me.

01:00:02.735 --> 01:00:04.695
Your call, Marshal.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.870
We don't have to settle this
here and now.

01:00:12.952 --> 01:00:15.956
You ain't going nowhere
in this weather.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.500
But I'll be seeing you gents
real soon.

01:00:18.584 --> 01:00:20.628
You can count on that.

01:00:33.474 --> 01:00:35.936
That marshal ain't gonna wait.

01:00:36.018 --> 01:00:39.272
That son of a bitch is gonna get
some men, come looking for us.

01:00:39.355 --> 01:00:41.649
He's gonna need us locked up
tight in that jail

01:00:41.732 --> 01:00:44.110
by the time Baxter hits town,
'cause if we ain't,

01:00:44.152 --> 01:00:45.611
Baxter's gonna start to think

01:00:45.695 --> 01:00:49.240
that maybe Marshal Poole ain't
worth what he's paying him.

01:00:49.324 --> 01:00:52.869
You got something on your mind,
just spit it out.

01:00:52.952 --> 01:00:55.664
Well, I say we take him
right at the jail.

01:00:55.747 --> 01:00:58.583
Lock him up, wait for Baxter
to come riding in.

01:00:58.625 --> 01:01:01.419
Hell, Charley, why don't we
just ride out to Baxter's ranch

01:01:01.461 --> 01:01:04.047
and go straight at him, too?

01:01:05.464 --> 01:01:07.259
Well, I'll fight
wherever you want, Boss.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.468
You just make the call.

01:01:08.552 --> 01:01:10.136
God damn it.

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.013
Now, hold on, Charley.
Hold on.

01:01:12.097 --> 01:01:14.934
Well, you asked me.
I told you.

01:01:20.021 --> 01:01:22.774
Charley, come on in
out of the rain, would you?

01:01:22.816 --> 01:01:24.484
Come on.

01:01:28.614 --> 01:01:30.073
Come on.

01:01:35.329 --> 01:01:36.997
Just getting testy
in my old age.

01:01:37.081 --> 01:01:38.707
Sounds like it's not
such a bad idea.

01:01:38.791 --> 01:01:40.876
Just roll it around
is all I ask.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.670
All right.

01:01:44.213 --> 01:01:46.632
What'd you think of my speech
in there?

01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:51.638
Liked it.

01:01:51.721 --> 01:01:54.808
Maybe I ought to run
for mayor.

01:01:54.891 --> 01:01:57.226
Well, I believe officeholders
got to be living, Boss.

01:02:06.153 --> 01:02:08.112
Come to see about the boy.

01:02:08.195 --> 01:02:11.824
He's asleep.
But, please, come in.

01:02:11.867 --> 01:02:14.410
Are you sure, ma'am?
We're a mite rank.

01:02:14.494 --> 01:02:15.995
We don't want to mess
your house.

01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:17.789
No, no.
No, please, it's all right.

01:02:17.872 --> 01:02:19.499
Come on in.

01:02:53.575 --> 01:02:55.328
Thank you, ma'am.

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.872
There you are.

01:03:12.929 --> 01:03:15.932
I can't get my fingers in.

01:03:19.936 --> 01:03:22.147
We can't get our big fat fingers
in these holes.

01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:24.567
- Too many broke knuckles.

01:03:24.649 --> 01:03:26.359
Oh, let me get you
something bigger.

01:03:26.443 --> 01:03:29.738
- No, ma'am, we can make do.
- No, no. It's all right.

01:03:29.779 --> 01:03:34.576
It's just nice to be sitting
at a table set with fine china.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.412
Those were my mother's.

01:03:37.496 --> 01:03:38.871
They were the only things
of hers

01:03:38.956 --> 01:03:41.583
that survived the trip
out here.

01:03:41.625 --> 01:03:43.544
I don't know why
I bring them out.

01:03:43.626 --> 01:03:46.170
I can't hold them, either.

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:48.716
Guess it just makes me
feel good.

01:03:48.799 --> 01:03:51.343
I say what's
on my mind, good or bad.

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:52.761
I admire that.

01:03:52.802 --> 01:03:55.306
Try living with it.

01:03:55.347 --> 01:03:57.600
See that?

01:03:57.641 --> 01:03:59.143
No need for a wife or home.

01:03:59.226 --> 01:04:01.937
We're just like a...
an old married couple.

01:04:03.522 --> 01:04:05.734
So, is it marriage
that scares you two

01:04:05.816 --> 01:04:07.943
- or putting down roots?
- No. Who'd have him?

01:04:07.985 --> 01:04:11.572
All rangy and mangy
like a rough old dog.

01:04:11.655 --> 01:04:13.282
How about I hold
your head underwater

01:04:13.366 --> 01:04:15.534
for just a little while?

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.922
I married once.

01:04:29.549 --> 01:04:31.800
Never knowed that,
did you, Charley?

01:04:31.885 --> 01:04:34.304
Had a wife and child.

01:04:34.346 --> 01:04:35.680
Sweet little spread, too.

01:04:35.764 --> 01:04:40.185
It was nothing fancy,
but we was young.

01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:42.812
Loved each other.

01:04:42.896 --> 01:04:45.149
Never had a cross word.

01:04:46.358 --> 01:04:47.901
They caught the typhus
and died.

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:52.155
And after that, home didn't seem
a place to spend time.

01:04:52.239 --> 01:04:54.200
Believe I've changed
my mind on that

01:04:54.241 --> 01:04:57.285
now that I'm getting on
in years.

01:05:02.541 --> 01:05:06.963
If Button lives
and we survive Baxter,

01:05:07.045 --> 01:05:10.758
I swear I aim to see to it
there's a home he's sleeping in

01:05:10.841 --> 01:05:13.510
instead of the cold prairie.

01:05:21.644 --> 01:05:23.563
Have yourself a last cup
of tea, Charley.

01:05:23.604 --> 01:05:25.606
I'd like to see Button again,
Miss Barlow.

01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:26.649
Of course.

01:05:26.733 --> 01:05:28.276
I know the way.

01:05:31.445 --> 01:05:33.198
Whew.

01:05:43.165 --> 01:05:46.128
Been riding with him 10 years.

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:48.504
Never said nothing
about being married.

01:05:57.306 --> 01:05:59.557
Where are you and Mr. Spearman
spending the night?

01:05:59.641 --> 01:06:00.642
Don't rightly know.

01:06:00.726 --> 01:06:05.188
It... depends on circumstances.

01:06:05.272 --> 01:06:07.649
You mean Marshal Poole?

01:06:07.733 --> 01:06:10.194
We have a spare room.
It's yours if you want it.

01:06:10.277 --> 01:06:11.278
Couldn't do that, ma'am.

01:06:11.361 --> 01:06:14.281
We'd be putting you in a spot
with the marshal and Baxter.

01:06:14.365 --> 01:06:17.493
Besides, it's a small town.

01:06:17.576 --> 01:06:21.247
Wouldn't look right,
particularly with the doc away.

01:06:40.183 --> 01:06:42.185
I'll take those.

01:06:43.143 --> 01:06:44.979
You know where they go?

01:06:45.063 --> 01:06:46.147
I saw.

01:06:46.231 --> 01:06:47.941
Thank you.

01:06:49.817 --> 01:06:52.862
Been raining like hell
ever since we got here.

01:06:52.946 --> 01:06:56.449
Water washing right down
Main Street.

01:06:56.532 --> 01:06:59.118
Charley saved a pup
from being washed away.

01:06:59.202 --> 01:07:01.454
Looked a little like old Tig.

01:07:06.042 --> 01:07:09.212
Now, if you can, you got to
listen and pay attention.

01:07:10.672 --> 01:07:14.259
'Cause I got something
important to say.

01:07:14.343 --> 01:07:19.014
I ain't been looking after you
for you to go out this way.

01:07:19.098 --> 01:07:21.559
The world ain't
a perfect place, Button.

01:07:21.642 --> 01:07:24.478
But you got
unfinished business here.

01:07:25.854 --> 01:07:28.774
So you come back,
you hear me, now?

01:07:30.025 --> 01:07:31.652
You come back.

01:07:38.952 --> 01:07:40.829
Kind of dumb talking to him
like that.

01:07:40.869 --> 01:07:41.912
No.

01:07:41.996 --> 01:07:43.956
No, it's good.

01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:47.501
You all right, Mr. Spearman?

01:07:47.586 --> 01:07:50.921
Believe I'm as right as a man
can be under the circumstances.

01:07:51.006 --> 01:07:54.342
Circumstances? That's just what
Mr. Waite called them.

01:07:54.425 --> 01:07:58.305
I asked him to reconsider,
and I'm asking you.

01:07:58.388 --> 01:08:01.516
By "reconsider,"
you mean tuck tail and run?

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.561
I mean save your life and his.

01:08:04.602 --> 01:08:06.855
He'll listen to you.

01:08:06.896 --> 01:08:09.274
Charley thinks for hisself,
Miss Barlow.

01:08:09.357 --> 01:08:12.527
He's a good man, and he knows
what has to be done.

01:08:13.904 --> 01:08:16.531
I'll be paying you now
for whatever else Button needs.

01:08:16.573 --> 01:08:18.325
In case it goes bad
for Charley and me,

01:08:18.408 --> 01:08:22.453
maybe you and the doc will see
we're taken care of properly.

01:08:23.037 --> 01:08:26.125
I'd like to put pen to paper
if you have them.

01:08:26.207 --> 01:08:28.667
Yes. Of course.

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:25.475
Mr. Waite?

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.478
Look at my face.

01:09:28.689 --> 01:09:30.857
- Oh! Sorry!

01:09:32.024 --> 01:09:35.112
I'm sorry.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.738
It's all right, Charley.

01:09:37.823 --> 01:09:39.950
Okay?
It just be us.

01:09:43.287 --> 01:09:45.122
It's all right, Charley.

01:09:54.715 --> 01:09:56.800
It's all right, Charley.

01:10:02.723 --> 01:10:05.143
It's all right.
I'll get it.

01:10:30.126 --> 01:10:31.961
Jumpy is all.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.687
She ought not to sneak up
like that.

01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:50.731
She weren't sneaking.

01:10:51.481 --> 01:10:53.525
I scared that woman
half to death.

01:10:53.567 --> 01:10:55.652
Yeah.
Scared me a little bit, too.

01:10:57.321 --> 01:10:59.448
Well, that's how it is, Boss.

01:10:59.530 --> 01:11:01.909
Ain't a pretty picture.

01:11:01.992 --> 01:11:04.203
Got your wits about you now?

01:11:05.371 --> 01:11:06.413
Yeah.

01:11:06.497 --> 01:11:07.414
Yeah.

01:11:07.498 --> 01:11:09.959
It weren't as bad as it looked.

01:11:10.042 --> 01:11:11.878
I'll bet.

01:11:22.973 --> 01:11:25.559
Go! Hyah!

01:11:51.042 --> 01:11:53.253
Two whiskeys, barkeep.

01:12:00.803 --> 01:12:04.098
Barkeep!
Two whiskeys.

01:12:07.309 --> 01:12:09.437
You see that sign?

01:12:09.477 --> 01:12:13.107
Around these parts,
free grazers is the first.

01:12:30.499 --> 01:12:33.210
Now, he asked you twice.

01:12:33.294 --> 01:12:35.463
Ain't gonna ask again.

01:12:38.007 --> 01:12:41.052
Hey, Bill, it's all right.

01:12:41.135 --> 01:12:43.137
These are the fellows
that saved my dog.

01:12:43.221 --> 01:12:46.474
I couldn't serve them
if they saved Jesus himself.

01:12:46.516 --> 01:12:48.435
Mr. Baxter would have my job.

01:12:48.517 --> 01:12:49.477
Baxter the owner?

01:12:49.561 --> 01:12:50.895
That's right.

01:12:50.979 --> 01:12:52.813
Give me a bottle.
I'll serve them myself.

01:12:52.856 --> 01:12:54.357
You know I can't do that.

01:13:06.036 --> 01:13:08.330
Now we'll have our drinks.

01:13:24.429 --> 01:13:26.391
Believe I'll have me another.

01:13:28.726 --> 01:13:30.811
Yes.

01:13:36.358 --> 01:13:40.279
Well, looks like the rain's
let up a bit.

01:13:40.363 --> 01:13:41.197
Well, if it don't,

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.783
there'll be trout fishing
right on Main Street.

01:13:46.285 --> 01:13:49.454
I'd like you to meet my boys.

01:13:49.539 --> 01:13:51.039
Ray and Cory.

01:13:52.103 --> 01:13:54.480
We run a freight outfit
when the weather cooperates.

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:55.607
Boss Spearman.

01:13:55.690 --> 01:13:59.319
And the marksman here
is Charley Waite.

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:02.947
Is all that true,
what you said in the cafÃ©?

01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:04.198
Yeah.

01:14:05.491 --> 01:14:06.991
There's a kid at the doc's house

01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:09.411
put on death's doorstep
by Baxter.

01:14:09.495 --> 01:14:10.704
Doc's wife's caring for him

01:14:10.788 --> 01:14:12.706
until he comes back
after the storm.

01:14:12.789 --> 01:14:13.915
Doc's wife?

01:14:13.999 --> 01:14:15.708
Yeah.
Miss Barlow.

01:14:15.792 --> 01:14:17.168
You mean Sue?

01:14:17.251 --> 01:14:18.629
That's right.

01:14:18.711 --> 01:14:21.088
Well, she'd make somebody
a fine wife.

01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:24.424
But she ain't the doc's.

01:14:24.509 --> 01:14:26.301
That's his sister.

01:14:26.386 --> 01:14:27.719
His sister?

01:14:27.804 --> 01:14:30.430
Ain't his wife.

01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:35.102
Good evening, Mack.

01:14:35.184 --> 01:14:36.103
Ralph.

01:14:36.185 --> 01:14:37.229
Ray, Cory.

01:14:37.312 --> 01:14:39.105
Whiskey.

01:14:39.147 --> 01:14:41.357
This is Ralph Peterson.
He runs the general store.

01:14:41.441 --> 01:14:43.943
That's where I was
when the dog got free.

01:14:44.026 --> 01:14:46.988
You fellers the free grazers,
I expect.

01:14:54.829 --> 01:14:55.997
No offense.

01:14:56.079 --> 01:14:58.165
Personally, I don't stand
with others around here

01:14:58.248 --> 01:15:00.125
about free grazers.

01:15:00.208 --> 01:15:04.754
There was a fight in your store
about a week or so back.

01:15:04.837 --> 01:15:07.173
Some of Baxter's men
jumped our friend.

01:15:07.256 --> 01:15:08.216
He was a big feller.

01:15:08.298 --> 01:15:10.134
Yeah.
I saw the whole thing.

01:15:10.175 --> 01:15:12.554
That big feller drubbed the hell
out of them other three.

01:15:12.636 --> 01:15:15.014
Broke one's arm.

01:15:15.097 --> 01:15:17.516
Be a gunhand named Butler,
would it?

01:15:17.598 --> 01:15:19.560
That's what they say.

01:15:20.935 --> 01:15:23.731
Felt bad about your friend.
Is he all right?

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.108
He's dead.

01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:31.904
That's too bad.

01:15:31.987 --> 01:15:33.489
Seemed like
a nice young feller.

01:15:33.572 --> 01:15:36.826
It's a shame what this town
has come to.

01:15:36.908 --> 01:15:39.411
You could do something
about it.

01:15:41.538 --> 01:15:43.622
What?

01:15:43.707 --> 01:15:44.958
We're freighters.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.003
Ralph here's a shopkeeper.

01:15:48.045 --> 01:15:50.630
You're men, ain't you?

01:15:50.671 --> 01:15:55.343
I didn't raise my boys
just to see them killed.

01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:57.844
Well, you may not know this,

01:15:57.928 --> 01:16:02.850
but there's things that gnaw
on a man worse than dying.

01:16:27.122 --> 01:16:28.165
Hey!

01:16:31.209 --> 01:16:32.543
Evening, gents.

01:16:32.585 --> 01:16:34.045
Evening.

01:16:34.128 --> 01:16:35.421
Better get out of this weather,

01:16:35.505 --> 01:16:37.715
or your bones are gonna be
even stiffer than mine.

01:16:37.799 --> 01:16:40.343
Heading into the saloon
to do just that.

01:16:40.425 --> 01:16:41.803
Come looking for you boys.

01:16:41.885 --> 01:16:44.012
I'd have bought you a drink
if you was earlier.

01:16:44.097 --> 01:16:46.432
Then turn around
and do it now.

01:16:46.515 --> 01:16:50.184
Marshal's got men waiting to
waylay you back at the livery.

01:16:50.227 --> 01:16:51.644
Another one's in your wagon.

01:16:51.728 --> 01:16:54.481
And then there's another
in the shed across from it.

01:16:54.564 --> 01:16:55.523
Marshal with them?

01:16:55.565 --> 01:16:57.025
No.

01:16:57.067 --> 01:16:59.193
He's sitting up there
all by his lonesome

01:16:59.236 --> 01:17:01.445
in that warm, dry jailhouse
with his feet up

01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:03.656
waiting for them
to bring you in.

01:17:03.739 --> 01:17:05.573
Or kill you.

01:17:05.616 --> 01:17:07.201
Well, thanks for the warning.

01:17:07.284 --> 01:17:11.538
Like I told you, never been
partial to the marshal's ways.

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:13.415
Dent Baxter's either.

01:17:13.498 --> 01:17:16.042
You're near the only friend
we got in this town.

01:17:16.084 --> 01:17:18.377
I'll be buying a drink or two.

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:21.255
You keep it quiet, all right?

01:17:25.342 --> 01:17:27.678
Time's come.
How you want to play it?

01:17:27.761 --> 01:17:30.597
Well, I work for you, Boss.
I'll play it however you want.

01:17:30.681 --> 01:17:33.182
Nobody works for anybody here,
Charley.

01:17:33.976 --> 01:17:36.562
Now, the name Butler mean
anything to you?

01:17:36.603 --> 01:17:39.105
You hear names when you're on
the other side of things.

01:17:39.147 --> 01:17:41.607
He as fast as they say?

01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:42.817
He's a killer.

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.569
Know him if you saw him?

01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:45.945
He ain't hard to recognize

01:17:45.986 --> 01:17:47.947
if you know
what you're looking for.

01:17:47.988 --> 01:17:49.448
Yeah.

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:51.158
Too bad if we get
shot up tonight

01:17:51.242 --> 01:17:53.201
before we get a chance
at him and Baxter.

01:17:53.286 --> 01:17:55.163
Sure as hell is.

01:17:55.245 --> 01:17:57.122
Tell you what,
I'd like to sit someplace dry

01:17:57.164 --> 01:18:00.207
while the marshal's men
sit out in this rain.

01:18:00.292 --> 01:18:02.919
Won't be so steady
come morning.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:03.754
Small town.

01:18:03.794 --> 01:18:08.091
It's hard to hide even at night
in this weather.

01:18:08.132 --> 01:18:10.552
What do you want to do?

01:18:10.635 --> 01:18:11.886
Yep.

01:18:11.969 --> 01:18:14.721
Heard me an idea
sounded pretty good.

01:18:15.848 --> 01:18:17.807
You did, did you?

01:18:20.728 --> 01:18:22.562
Well, all right.

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:38.911
He's alone.

01:18:40.328 --> 01:18:42.039
Get your hands up.

01:18:42.122 --> 01:18:44.124
You must be plumb crazy.

01:18:44.207 --> 01:18:45.708
Shut up.

01:18:58.513 --> 01:19:00.597
You're dead men.

01:19:02.265 --> 01:19:04.893
Didn't he tell you to shut up?

01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:10.315
What's that?

01:19:10.357 --> 01:19:13.693
Chloroform.
Stole it from the doc's.

01:19:16.362 --> 01:19:18.531
You gonna arrest me
for that, Marshal?

01:19:24.035 --> 01:19:25.746
Jesus.

01:20:06.783 --> 01:20:08.785
Well, looky here.

01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:10.662
He's asleep.

01:20:10.747 --> 01:20:12.456
No.

01:20:13.624 --> 01:20:15.250
Looky here.

01:20:16.293 --> 01:20:18.252
Put 'em down.

01:20:21.923 --> 01:20:23.424
This way.

01:20:35.977 --> 01:20:37.896
What do you think?
Do you like it?

01:20:39.272 --> 01:20:41.191
You like it,
you son of a buck, you?

01:20:41.274 --> 01:20:43.108
- Huh?

01:20:43.193 --> 01:20:45.861
A little bit more?
A bit more?

01:20:45.946 --> 01:20:47.154
A bit more.

01:20:51.033 --> 01:20:54.286
Wasn't no call to leave me
setting out like that.

01:20:54.328 --> 01:20:57.831
- There wasn't a lot of time.
- I ain't bait, Charley.

01:21:02.126 --> 01:21:03.796
I hear you.

01:21:03.836 --> 01:21:05.630
Best you remember it.

01:21:05.673 --> 01:21:08.925
Well, I guess you ain't gonna
let me forget, are you?

01:21:10.635 --> 01:21:13.470
Starting to enjoy that part,
aren't you?

01:21:19.977 --> 01:21:21.103
Sorry if we woke you.

01:21:21.144 --> 01:21:22.604
No, no.
You didn't.

01:21:22.645 --> 01:21:25.649
- Come to see if...
- Go see for yourself.

01:21:29.653 --> 01:21:31.153
Hey.

01:21:32.114 --> 01:21:33.864
- Hey, Boss.
- Hey.

01:21:33.948 --> 01:21:35.616
You gave us a fright, pard.

01:21:35.658 --> 01:21:38.244
Thought we was gonna lose you.

01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:41.038
Just taking a little nap,
that's all.

01:21:41.122 --> 01:21:42.998
It's good to have you back.

01:21:43.081 --> 01:21:45.458
We owe you, Miss Barlow,
and we thank you.

01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:47.294
You best thank God instead.

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:51.673
Yes, ma'am.
We'll... give that a try.

01:21:51.714 --> 01:21:53.925
Well, I expect you men
are hungry.

01:21:54.008 --> 01:21:55.093
Button just ate.

01:21:55.175 --> 01:21:57.761
I thought I'd make myself
some breakfast.

01:21:57.846 --> 01:22:00.681
Two more mouths wouldn't be
any bother.

01:22:00.764 --> 01:22:03.517
I'm just gonna change.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.519
You.
You should try to sleep.

01:22:06.603 --> 01:22:08.731
He will.

01:22:08.813 --> 01:22:11.441
Now, you do as she says now.

01:22:11.525 --> 01:22:13.192
Yes, Boss.

01:22:13.276 --> 01:22:15.069
Okay.

01:22:16.738 --> 01:22:18.031
Boss?

01:22:18.072 --> 01:22:19.323
Yeah?

01:22:20.324 --> 01:22:22.034
Mose?

01:22:22.118 --> 01:22:24.536
I'll be along in a minute,
Charley.

01:22:24.579 --> 01:22:27.164
Be seeing you, Button.

01:22:52.772 --> 01:22:54.481
Aah.

01:24:29.736 --> 01:24:32.071
If you don't mind my saying,
ma'am, you look...

01:24:34.157 --> 01:24:35.408
Tired.

01:24:35.490 --> 01:24:39.119
Oh.
It's been a long night.

01:24:39.162 --> 01:24:41.204
Why don't you sit?

01:24:43.499 --> 01:24:45.959
Let an old cowpoke cook up
some breakfast.

01:24:46.043 --> 01:24:48.879
No, I couldn't let you.

01:24:48.962 --> 01:24:50.505
Sure, you could.

01:24:53.091 --> 01:24:55.092
Thank you.

01:24:57.596 --> 01:25:01.682
I want to apologize
for earlier.

01:25:01.765 --> 01:25:03.267
Oh, no, no.
There's no need.

01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:04.602
You were startled.

01:25:04.684 --> 01:25:08.146
No, it was more than that.

01:25:09.856 --> 01:25:12.192
I've been trying to put
some bad times behind me.

01:25:12.233 --> 01:25:15.861
But sometimes
they don't stay put.

01:25:17.364 --> 01:25:19.824
Always makes me feel better
to let things breathe a little.

01:25:19.907 --> 01:25:21.325
Not bury them.

01:25:21.367 --> 01:25:24.703
I'm learning that.
Trying, anyway.

01:25:24.787 --> 01:25:27.706
Well, that's all
any of us can do.

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:30.793
Just glad Button's
getting better.

01:25:31.584 --> 01:25:35.171
Don't believe I've ever seen
Boss so worried.

01:25:35.256 --> 01:25:37.215
Well, the doctor will be
on his way home

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:40.300
as soon as the storm's passed.

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:43.388
By the doctor,
you mean your brother?

01:25:46.766 --> 01:25:50.560
It's just we've been thinking
that you and the doc was...

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:52.896
husband and wife.

01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:54.439
Oh.

01:25:55.398 --> 01:25:57.733
You did?

01:25:57.776 --> 01:26:01.070
Didn't find out
till last night.

01:26:01.113 --> 01:26:03.656
Thought you was married, Sue.

01:26:03.739 --> 01:26:06.034
Why, no.
I'm...

01:26:06.075 --> 01:26:08.411
I'm not, Charley.

01:26:10.078 --> 01:26:13.916
Well, that's good.
I mean that's good to know.

01:26:13.999 --> 01:26:16.710
Otherwise,
we'd been thinking wrong.

01:26:16.751 --> 01:26:18.169
We wouldn't want to do that.

01:26:18.254 --> 01:26:21.590
No.
No, of course not.

01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:44.027
Much obliged to you, ma'am.

01:26:44.111 --> 01:26:46.779
You're very welcome,
Mr. Spearman.

01:26:49.073 --> 01:26:50.783
Thank you, Sue.

01:26:52.075 --> 01:26:54.579
Take care of yourself,
Charley.

01:27:06.048 --> 01:27:09.718
Are you just gonna go off like
that without saying nothing?

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.093
Ain't nothing to say.

01:27:11.136 --> 01:27:13.971
I seen how you look at that gal
and the way she looks at you.

01:27:14.013 --> 01:27:15.932
It ain't right to walk away
without a word.

01:27:15.973 --> 01:27:18.976
What do you want me
to tell her, Boss?

01:27:19.018 --> 01:27:21.102
We probably ain't gonna make it?

01:27:21.187 --> 01:27:24.314
Be a big fat comfort.

01:27:26.066 --> 01:27:28.318
I don't know what you should
tell her, Charley.

01:27:28.401 --> 01:27:32.196
I wish I'd have said more
to my wife before she passed.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:35.158
This may be the last time she
sees you in this world, Charley.

01:27:35.199 --> 01:27:36.284
Or you her.

01:27:36.367 --> 01:27:37.826
So tell her whatever you can.

01:27:37.911 --> 01:27:40.329
'Cause she's entitled to more
than just your backside

01:27:40.371 --> 01:27:42.957
walking away.

01:27:49.128 --> 01:27:50.505
Charley.

01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:57.095
I'm not sure
what's worth saying or not.

01:27:57.177 --> 01:27:59.013
Well, you don't have to
say anything.

01:27:59.097 --> 01:28:01.265
Yeah, I do.

01:28:01.348 --> 01:28:03.809
Boss is right about that.

01:28:03.893 --> 01:28:06.687
He's right
about a lot of things.

01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:08.272
It's just...

01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:14.735
I'm not who you think
I am, Sue.

01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:17.613
I've... been places.
I've done things.

01:28:17.698 --> 01:28:20.033
Most of them, I'm not proud of.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:25.662
You know, I always hoped
somebody gentle and caring

01:28:25.705 --> 01:28:27.706
might come along.

01:28:30.209 --> 01:28:33.546
Years pass.
A small town and all.

01:28:33.587 --> 01:28:37.799
And your hopes begin to fade
a little every day

01:28:37.882 --> 01:28:41.468
until you hardly remember
what they were.

01:28:41.553 --> 01:28:43.847
I've seen who you are, Charley.

01:28:43.888 --> 01:28:46.307
The way you looked after
that boy

01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:49.018
and the respect you give Boss.

01:28:49.101 --> 01:28:50.269
It might be little bits.

01:28:50.352 --> 01:28:54.439
But they're enough
for a woman who looks.

01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:00.236
Men are gonna get killed
here today, Sue.

01:29:00.279 --> 01:29:02.280
And I'm gonna kill them.

01:29:02.363 --> 01:29:04.282
You understand that?

01:29:05.198 --> 01:29:06.910
Yes.

01:29:09.621 --> 01:29:11.705
I want you to have this.

01:29:11.789 --> 01:29:14.124
It's always brought me luck.

01:29:14.207 --> 01:29:18.711
I... can't take your locket.

01:29:19.755 --> 01:29:22.757
It's not your choice
when it's a gift.

01:29:23.466 --> 01:29:25.509
It's a good likeness of you.

01:29:26.552 --> 01:29:29.430
It's my mother
when she was young.

01:29:31.349 --> 01:29:34.060
She's beautiful.

01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:43.109
I want you to know that
if I don't ever see you again

01:29:43.193 --> 01:29:46.238
that I meant everything
I said to you

01:29:46.279 --> 01:29:50.408
and I appreciate everything
you said to me.

01:29:50.491 --> 01:29:53.827
Ain't nothing that happened in
this old town been a surprise.

01:29:53.912 --> 01:29:56.288
Except you.

01:30:07.841 --> 01:30:10.510
I'll be seeing you,
Charley Waite.

01:30:25.315 --> 01:30:26.733
Happy?

01:30:26.817 --> 01:30:29.278
Yeah.
If you are.

01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:54.843
Morning, boys.

01:30:57.386 --> 01:30:58.971
Brung you breakfast.

01:31:01.349 --> 01:31:03.517
Hey, you kids.
Come away from there.

01:31:03.601 --> 01:31:05.352
Come on.

01:31:05.394 --> 01:31:06.812
You get along.

01:31:18.781 --> 01:31:21.409
What do you suppose
this looks like?

01:31:21.491 --> 01:31:23.620
It don't matter.

01:31:23.703 --> 01:31:26.121
Whole town knows
there's a fight coming.

01:31:26.205 --> 01:31:28.374
They just hope it don't
spill over to them.

01:31:41.052 --> 01:31:43.846
Well, if I'm gonna get killed,

01:31:43.888 --> 01:31:47.850
I got a hankering to soothe
my sweet tooth.

01:31:52.562 --> 01:31:54.147
Morning.

01:31:54.773 --> 01:31:56.858
Morning.

01:31:59.402 --> 01:32:01.863
What can I do for you fellers?

01:32:01.904 --> 01:32:04.741
Thinking about some candy.

01:32:04.824 --> 01:32:06.743
- Candy?
- Yeah.

01:32:07.409 --> 01:32:09.703
Yes, sir.
Candy.

01:32:09.745 --> 01:32:11.288
Got anything you want.

01:32:11.373 --> 01:32:13.749
- Got jawbreakers.
- Yeah.

01:32:13.832 --> 01:32:18.878
Gumdrops, candy canes,
licorice, caramel, honey crisp.

01:32:18.921 --> 01:32:21.589
Jujubes, lollipops,
milk chocolate...

01:32:21.673 --> 01:32:23.258
Looking for something special.

01:32:23.341 --> 01:32:26.386
Now, what's the most expensive
you've got?

01:32:27.845 --> 01:32:29.305
Well...

01:32:29.389 --> 01:32:32.099
Ooh.
I got just the thing.

01:32:41.233 --> 01:32:43.360
- This is dark chocolate.
- Yeah.

01:32:43.442 --> 01:32:46.362
It comes all the way
from Switzerland, Europe.

01:32:46.446 --> 01:32:48.781
That's near France, see.

01:32:48.865 --> 01:32:50.825
They call it bittersweet.

01:32:50.909 --> 01:32:52.910
Melts in your mouth.

01:32:52.952 --> 01:32:55.079
- You tried it?
- No.

01:32:55.121 --> 01:32:57.456
How do you know
it melts in your mouth?

01:33:00.125 --> 01:33:04.296
Well, truth is
we can't afford it ourselves.

01:33:04.337 --> 01:33:07.340
Mm-hmm.
I'll take two.

01:33:07.424 --> 01:33:08.884
Don't you want to know how much?

01:33:08.967 --> 01:33:10.552
Nope.

01:33:10.634 --> 01:33:12.012
Yes, sir.

01:33:12.888 --> 01:33:15.932
And three of your finest cigars.

01:33:15.973 --> 01:33:20.144
My friend and me got a hankering
for Switzerland chocolate

01:33:20.227 --> 01:33:22.271
and a good smoke.

01:33:29.944 --> 01:33:33.531
Now, these come all the way
from Havana, Cuba.

01:33:33.616 --> 01:33:35.617
Thank you.

01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:38.161
- Anything else?
- No. That'll do it.

01:33:38.202 --> 01:33:40.287
How much I owe you?

01:33:40.330 --> 01:33:42.706
It's... $5.

01:33:47.044 --> 01:33:48.629
Charley.

01:33:48.712 --> 01:33:51.006
Here you are.

01:33:51.048 --> 01:33:52.841
Believe I'll enjoy
these later, Boss.

01:33:52.924 --> 01:33:54.217
Yep.

01:33:56.178 --> 01:33:58.180
You ought to do yourselves
a favor and ride on

01:33:58.221 --> 01:34:00.514
while you still got time.

01:34:00.556 --> 01:34:02.807
Tried minding
our own business.

01:34:05.852 --> 01:34:07.312
This is good.

01:34:07.355 --> 01:34:09.357
Worth every penny.

01:34:13.401 --> 01:34:15.695
You're gonna
get yourselves killed.

01:34:15.737 --> 01:34:17.196
Try that, Ralph.

01:34:17.239 --> 01:34:18.907
Go on.

01:34:21.868 --> 01:34:23.410
Sitting right here
in front of you.

01:34:23.495 --> 01:34:25.372
Never even tried it.

01:34:26.705 --> 01:34:31.544
Shame to go forever without
taking a taste of something.

01:34:37.632 --> 01:34:40.594
Charley, let's go.

01:34:44.097 --> 01:34:45.306
Percy!

01:34:45.389 --> 01:34:47.016
Up here!

01:34:47.058 --> 01:34:49.560
Brought you a cigar.
All the way from Havana, Cuba.

01:34:49.644 --> 01:34:50.894
You don't say?

01:34:50.978 --> 01:34:52.938
I've heard about them,
but I never had one.

01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:55.232
Much obliged to you.

01:34:55.315 --> 01:34:56.567
What do you think?

01:34:56.608 --> 01:34:59.444
Better than them crappers
I usually smoke.

01:34:59.528 --> 01:35:01.280
So, you're gonna make
your stand down here?

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:03.781
Yeah.
But out there around our wagon.

01:35:03.865 --> 01:35:07.868
Not much choice without getting
a lot of innocent folks shot up.

01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:09.663
Like to place some guns and ammo

01:35:09.745 --> 01:35:11.497
where we can get to it
on a short run.

01:35:11.581 --> 01:35:12.957
Help yourself.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.042
We'll try to stay
out of your barn.

01:35:15.126 --> 01:35:16.711
Might not be able to.

01:35:16.751 --> 01:35:19.087
Best bring in your livestock.

01:35:19.796 --> 01:35:21.214
Be wishing you good luck now.

01:35:21.256 --> 01:35:22.757
Thank you.

01:35:42.818 --> 01:35:45.486
It's a pretty day
for making things right.

01:35:45.571 --> 01:35:46.821
Well, enjoy it.

01:35:46.906 --> 01:35:48.448
Because once it starts,

01:35:48.531 --> 01:35:50.867
it's gonna be messy
like nothing you ever seen.

01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:52.285
I ain't survived my years

01:35:52.367 --> 01:35:54.662
without being in
some fights, Charley.

01:35:56.748 --> 01:35:58.707
I ain't doubting
your grit, Boss.

01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:00.418
You got more than any man
I ever known.

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.878
It's just that...

01:36:02.961 --> 01:36:04.296
I don't mean to be hard.

01:36:04.338 --> 01:36:05.964
It's just the other night,
them fellows

01:36:06.048 --> 01:36:07.799
back in them trees we let go.

01:36:07.883 --> 01:36:09.800
It was my call, Charley.

01:36:09.843 --> 01:36:11.802
I can see now
it was probably a mistake.

01:36:11.887 --> 01:36:15.097
It's not what I meant.
I mean, maybe it was.

01:36:15.139 --> 01:36:18.267
But the fact is it's what I
always respected about you.

01:36:18.351 --> 01:36:21.436
What I always appreciated.

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:25.691
How you treated other people
and how you treated me.

01:36:25.774 --> 01:36:28.652
How you never look
for no trouble.

01:36:28.693 --> 01:36:31.738
That kept me from trouble.

01:36:31.821 --> 01:36:33.240
But it's found us here, Boss.

01:36:33.323 --> 01:36:36.284
And if we're to have
any chance, you'll...

01:36:36.326 --> 01:36:39.663
You go on and talk, Charley.
I'll hear you.

01:36:39.745 --> 01:36:40.996
I'm almost certain

01:36:41.081 --> 01:36:44.166
they'll be overly confident
in their numbers.

01:36:44.250 --> 01:36:47.044
Especially if we're standing
right out here in front of them.

01:36:47.127 --> 01:36:48.712
It's not like we'll have
any advantage.

01:36:48.796 --> 01:36:50.755
But if they're out there
with us,

01:36:50.839 --> 01:36:54.051
then they won't have as much
as they might have otherwise.

01:36:54.133 --> 01:36:56.261
I don't figure all of them
to be killers.

01:36:56.345 --> 01:36:59.305
Only two or three like Butler
will have done much of it.

01:36:59.347 --> 01:37:01.390
I'll be looking to him.

01:37:02.433 --> 01:37:05.478
The others will be hired men.
Probably saddle tramps.

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.938
Maybe ex-Army.

01:37:08.021 --> 01:37:09.648
The rest will be cowpunchers.

01:37:09.690 --> 01:37:12.526
They won't want to line up
in front of us.

01:37:13.652 --> 01:37:15.486
It'll happen fast
once I start.

01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:18.740
So just keep yourself
moving forward.

01:37:18.823 --> 01:37:22.577
And they'll either move or root.
Maybe even freeze up.

01:37:22.661 --> 01:37:24.745
It don't matter which.

01:37:24.829 --> 01:37:27.582
You just start right in on them
with that scatter-gun.

01:37:27.665 --> 01:37:31.334
When you've done both barrels,
drop it, pull your pistol,

01:37:31.377 --> 01:37:34.504
and make a run for that building
where we stashed them others.

01:37:34.547 --> 01:37:36.506
I'll be trying to do the same
if I can.

01:37:36.548 --> 01:37:37.883
Right.

01:37:37.966 --> 01:37:41.386
Sounds like you got it
all worked out.

01:37:41.428 --> 01:37:42.596
Yeah.

01:37:42.679 --> 01:37:45.056
Except the part
where we don't get killed.

01:37:46.307 --> 01:37:50.185
Best smoke these
while we got the chance.

01:37:50.227 --> 01:37:52.229
Yeah.

01:38:17.377 --> 01:38:21.548
I'm thinking about getting out
of the damn cattle business.

01:38:24.468 --> 01:38:26.720
You never said nothing
except nag me and Button

01:38:26.762 --> 01:38:28.846
about getting ourselves out.

01:38:28.931 --> 01:38:31.516
Well, maybe my own words
struck a chord.

01:38:31.599 --> 01:38:34.518
Thought maybe
I'd sell off the cattle

01:38:34.602 --> 01:38:38.897
and have enough to start up
a saloon somewhere.

01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:41.525
Man could stay cool
in the summer

01:38:41.608 --> 01:38:43.527
and dry in the winter.

01:38:46.029 --> 01:38:49.949
Some dancing girls might be
nice, you know?

01:38:49.991 --> 01:38:51.951
Have to get me some.

01:38:54.703 --> 01:38:56.288
Yeah.

01:39:01.210 --> 01:39:06.257
"If I die,
please sell my good horse

01:39:06.298 --> 01:39:09.509
and my good saddle and my guns

01:39:09.593 --> 01:39:14.722
to buy a tea set
for Miss Barlow. "

01:39:15.473 --> 01:39:17.684
"Charley Waite. "

01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:23.147
"Postscript...

01:39:23.188 --> 01:39:25.649
I like this one.

01:39:25.733 --> 01:39:27.734
But I don't know. "

01:39:28.652 --> 01:39:31.113
"Princess pattern. "

01:39:35.158 --> 01:39:36.284
Oh, hell.

01:39:36.368 --> 01:39:38.245
What's the matter?

01:39:40.413 --> 01:39:43.207
Oh.
Looks like you waited too long.

01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:46.459
Kind of like us
and free grazing.

01:39:46.544 --> 01:39:49.462
Well, good is good.

01:39:49.547 --> 01:39:51.339
Melted or not.

01:40:00.848 --> 01:40:04.811
Looks like you're plumb chained,
to your work, Marshal.

01:40:04.852 --> 01:40:06.312
Get up, Poole.

01:40:06.353 --> 01:40:08.689
He ain't worth a damn.

01:40:08.772 --> 01:40:10.691
Get them all up!

01:40:10.774 --> 01:40:12.526
Sobered up!

01:40:13.861 --> 01:40:15.361
Ooh.

01:40:17.655 --> 01:40:20.950
I got a feeling there's gonna be
a new marshal in town.

01:40:24.454 --> 01:40:25.330
All right!

01:40:25.371 --> 01:40:29.083
It's time to settle
these free grazers.

01:40:29.166 --> 01:40:31.043
Oh, you leave your horses.

01:40:32.211 --> 01:40:35.005
We're walking down
to their wagon.

01:40:35.047 --> 01:40:37.841
When we get there, you better
empty your guns in them.

01:40:37.883 --> 01:40:40.509
Or I'll damn well
shoot you myself.

01:40:44.348 --> 01:40:46.766
Now, you three skirt
the buildings.

01:40:46.849 --> 01:40:48.518
Get into the alleys
on the side.

01:40:48.559 --> 01:40:50.686
- Come on.

01:41:20.046 --> 01:41:23.592
Hayley!
Come away from there.

01:41:26.094 --> 01:41:27.930
Finish these later.

01:41:33.268 --> 01:41:35.270
Okay.

01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:38.690
I'm not going to my maker
without knowing your given name.

01:41:38.772 --> 01:41:42.067
Mine ain't Waite.
It's Postelwaite.

01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:44.528
Charles Travis Postelwaite.

01:41:44.611 --> 01:41:46.238
What's yours?

01:41:47.071 --> 01:41:48.991
Sure ain't Boss.

01:41:53.327 --> 01:41:56.622
I mean it, Boss.
I'm asking you straight up.

01:41:56.664 --> 01:41:58.666
It's Bluebonnet.

01:42:00.084 --> 01:42:00.960
Bluebonnet?

01:42:01.002 --> 01:42:03.170
Bluebonnet, yeah.

01:42:03.254 --> 01:42:04.087
No middle name?

01:42:04.130 --> 01:42:07.966
No, just Bluebonnet Spearman.
And don't you tell no one.

01:42:09.217 --> 01:42:12.762
I want to hear you swear
an oath. Now, go on.

01:42:12.846 --> 01:42:13.930
I swear it.

01:42:14.014 --> 01:42:16.808
All right.
Okay.

01:42:19.185 --> 01:42:21.271
Just in case.

01:42:37.202 --> 01:42:39.871
Said eight.
Count five.

01:42:46.169 --> 01:42:49.297
You should have run when you
had the chance, Spearman.

01:42:49.338 --> 01:42:51.965
Not much for running
from cowards.

01:42:53.175 --> 01:42:55.427
I see the marshal ain't
with you.

01:42:55.511 --> 01:42:57.346
You won't find it so funny

01:42:57.386 --> 01:43:00.224
when you're all shot to hell
and dying.

01:43:13.027 --> 01:43:16.112
- You the one killed our friend?
- That's right.

01:43:16.197 --> 01:43:19.407
I shot the boy, too,
and I enjoyed it.

01:44:51.618 --> 01:44:53.161
Hayley!

01:44:56.039 --> 01:44:57.873
Back up!

01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:03.337
Where's the back door?

01:45:03.421 --> 01:45:05.506
- Back door!
- Right this way.

01:45:29.236 --> 01:45:31.279
It's locked.

01:45:50.381 --> 01:45:52.216
You hit?

01:45:52.299 --> 01:45:53.842
I'm good.

01:45:56.095 --> 01:45:57.887
You.

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.602
You get out of this house!

01:46:11.567 --> 01:46:13.402
You pull that trigger, Baxter,

01:46:13.486 --> 01:46:16.363
and you can forget about me
patching you up.

01:46:19.115 --> 01:46:22.160
You get your bag.
You're with me.

01:46:22.202 --> 01:46:23.996
Go on.

01:48:20.854 --> 01:48:24.481
Get the hell up, Poole!
On your feet, God damn it!

01:48:28.027 --> 01:48:30.320
Yeah!

01:48:30.363 --> 01:48:33.657
You're... going out there.

01:48:33.699 --> 01:48:36.450
We ain't ourselves yet!

01:48:58.013 --> 01:48:59.931
I see they hobbled you.

01:49:00.015 --> 01:49:02.350
It's been a while
since I was in a fight.

01:49:02.392 --> 01:49:05.186
I panicked. Fell back.
Like to have broke my foot.

01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:06.438
Ornery old fool.

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:09.690
Well, or that damn Cuban cigar
got me riled up.

01:49:13.861 --> 01:49:15.321
Charley.

01:49:15.362 --> 01:49:16.821
You two wait here.

01:49:16.864 --> 01:49:19.032
Hold on, there, Charley.
Hold on.

01:49:19.116 --> 01:49:21.618
I ain't looking over my shoulder
the rest of my days.

01:49:21.702 --> 01:49:23.661
Charley.

01:49:23.704 --> 01:49:25.914
You said we was gonna
kill them all.

01:49:25.997 --> 01:49:27.832
I aim to do just that.

01:49:27.874 --> 01:49:29.625
I meant kill them.
Not murder them.

01:49:29.709 --> 01:49:31.711
Splitting hairs,
ain't you, Boss?

01:49:31.793 --> 01:49:35.340
Mister, I heard what you said.

01:49:36.131 --> 01:49:37.716
I won't come after you.
I promise.

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:39.885
No, I expect you won't.

01:49:39.968 --> 01:49:42.221
I ain't gonna let you
do it, Charley.

01:49:42.304 --> 01:49:44.473
You do this, you ain't no
different than Poole or Baxter

01:49:44.556 --> 01:49:47.726
or that gunhand of his
that murdered Mose.

01:49:47.810 --> 01:49:49.894
Him killing Mose
is how this started.

01:49:49.977 --> 01:49:51.897
We come for justice,
not vengeance.

01:49:51.979 --> 01:49:53.648
Them is two different things.

01:49:53.731 --> 01:49:55.649
Not today, they ain't.

01:49:56.901 --> 01:49:57.860
Step aside!

01:49:57.902 --> 01:49:59.612
Listen to him, son.

01:49:59.694 --> 01:50:02.739
You done what you had to here
because they give you no choice.

01:50:02.824 --> 01:50:05.659
Don't go making this
into something bad.

01:50:07.118 --> 01:50:09.287
This ain't the way, pard.

01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:24.385
Mister, thank you.

01:50:24.426 --> 01:50:25.718
Thank you.

01:50:25.761 --> 01:50:27.555
Didn't do it for you, boy.

01:50:27.595 --> 01:50:30.266
Just make peace
with your bad deeds.

01:50:33.852 --> 01:50:35.603
Sue!

01:50:35.687 --> 01:50:37.438
Get in here!

01:50:37.522 --> 01:50:39.858
Oh, my God.

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.658
Get out of the way.

01:50:52.119 --> 01:50:53.911
Button!

01:51:22.104 --> 01:51:24.565
- Put it down.
- Let the lady be!

01:52:21.034 --> 01:52:23.995
We got your boy, Spearman!

01:52:33.379 --> 01:52:36.715
You better drop them guns
and come walking down the street

01:52:36.757 --> 01:52:39.134
or I shoot him.

01:52:39.218 --> 01:52:41.345
You've got ten seconds!

01:52:42.595 --> 01:52:45.683
We ain't giving up our guns.

01:52:45.765 --> 01:52:47.642
He's gonna kill Button anyway.

01:52:47.726 --> 01:52:48.685
One!

01:52:48.727 --> 01:52:52.105
The only chance for him or us
when we walk up is these guns.

01:52:52.188 --> 01:52:54.356
Two!

01:52:56.151 --> 01:52:57.818
Three!

01:52:57.902 --> 01:52:58.861
Sue!

01:52:58.945 --> 01:53:00.779
Stop!

01:53:00.863 --> 01:53:04.324
Stop it!
Stop it right now!

01:53:10.079 --> 01:53:11.622
Four!

01:53:13.041 --> 01:53:15.043
Sue.

01:53:15.126 --> 01:53:17.712
You're a disgrace,
Marshal Poole.

01:53:17.753 --> 01:53:20.964
You always have been.

01:53:21.048 --> 01:53:24.260
I know it.
That's just the way it is.

01:53:25.636 --> 01:53:27.263
Five!

01:53:29.347 --> 01:53:31.183
Six!

01:53:54.496 --> 01:53:57.081
Have a nice rest,
did you, Marshal?

01:53:57.165 --> 01:53:59.751
You'll be having a long one
yourself in a minute.

01:53:59.793 --> 01:54:01.294
Been enough killing for you?

01:54:01.336 --> 01:54:04.254
Be enough when you're
both dead and buried.

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.051
Let the woman and boy go.
They ain't a part of this.

01:54:09.134 --> 01:54:11.595
If you want considerations,

01:54:11.678 --> 01:54:14.013
you drop them guns
on the ground.

01:54:14.097 --> 01:54:15.724
Let her take him to the doc's.

01:54:15.808 --> 01:54:18.310
The doc's in jail,
and he ain't leaving

01:54:18.393 --> 01:54:21.062
unless your guns
are in the dirt.

01:54:21.938 --> 01:54:25.316
I'll crush any man
who stands with them!

01:54:25.399 --> 01:54:26.442
When I finish that,

01:54:26.484 --> 01:54:29.779
I'll torch your homes and drive
your wives and children

01:54:29.821 --> 01:54:32.824
out into the cold prairie.

01:54:32.906 --> 01:54:36.243
So you women, you better
take hold of your men.

01:54:36.326 --> 01:54:39.496
If you don't, you'll be raising
orphans by winter.

01:54:40.539 --> 01:54:42.415
Mack Langly!

01:54:43.542 --> 01:54:46.294
It doesn't matter
whether you run or stay!

01:54:46.336 --> 01:54:49.631
You and your boys
are already dead!

01:54:50.507 --> 01:54:53.217
Mack Langly is our friend!

01:55:04.144 --> 01:55:06.271
I didn't come all the way
from Ireland

01:55:06.354 --> 01:55:10.441
to see my land pissed on
by free grazers.

01:55:11.525 --> 01:55:14.987
Now, I want them guns
in the dirt.

01:55:16.114 --> 01:55:17.991
Him first.

01:55:18.031 --> 01:55:20.117
The gunhand.

01:56:02.864 --> 01:56:05.450
Looks like you're losing
your army, Marshal.

01:56:23.759 --> 01:56:25.428
Get down!

01:57:04.839 --> 01:57:06.632
It went through?

01:57:06.675 --> 01:57:08.135
Yeah.

01:57:08.175 --> 01:57:10.094
Is he hit, Sue?

01:57:11.929 --> 01:57:13.556
- Sue, is he hit?
- No! No!

01:57:13.639 --> 01:57:15.558
But he's bleeding bad again!

01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:17.726
God damn it.
Can you stop it?

01:57:17.809 --> 01:57:18.810
I'm trying.

01:57:18.894 --> 01:57:20.645
I'm gonna kill you, Baxter!

01:57:20.728 --> 01:57:23.398
Well, come on, if you're coming!

01:57:27.819 --> 01:57:29.153
Can you cover me?

01:57:29.195 --> 01:57:32.781
Might be best to wait him out.
Probably bleed to death.

01:57:35.075 --> 01:57:36.160
I ain't waiting.

01:57:36.243 --> 01:57:38.162
Button needs that doctor
right now.

01:57:38.245 --> 01:57:39.872
Well, you know,
that door's locked.

01:57:39.955 --> 01:57:42.540
Well, it won't be
when the scatter-gun hits it.

01:57:42.624 --> 01:57:45.126
I'm waiting for you, Spearman!

01:57:47.671 --> 01:57:50.673
I'm coming for you,
you son of a bitch.

01:57:53.342 --> 01:57:55.511
Okay, Charley?

01:57:55.594 --> 01:57:56.804
Yeah.

01:57:56.846 --> 01:57:58.723
You ready?

01:57:59.639 --> 01:58:01.141
Yeah.

01:58:56.943 --> 01:58:58.361
I'm dying.

01:58:58.402 --> 01:59:01.364
And for what?
More cows?

01:59:01.405 --> 01:59:03.031
Killed a good man.

01:59:03.116 --> 01:59:05.367
And maybe that boy
out there out yonder.

01:59:05.409 --> 01:59:07.911
You get no sympathy
for your death.

01:59:07.953 --> 01:59:09.914
Get!

01:59:09.955 --> 01:59:13.041
You're... nothing.

01:59:13.082 --> 01:59:15.210
Yeah? Maybe so.

01:59:15.293 --> 01:59:18.587
But I'll still be breathing
in another minute.

01:59:18.672 --> 01:59:22.091
Well, kill me, then.

01:59:30.599 --> 01:59:31.766
No.

01:59:33.101 --> 01:59:35.520
I ain't wasting a good bullet
to ease your pain,

01:59:35.603 --> 01:59:37.439
you son of a bitch.

02:01:42.805 --> 02:01:44.931
Your man's in the saloon.

02:01:46.434 --> 02:01:48.352
Ordered everybody out.

02:01:49.269 --> 02:01:53.064
Asked to see your sister
iffen she's willing.

02:02:00.737 --> 02:02:02.489
He'd like to speak with you,
Miss Barlow,

02:02:02.574 --> 02:02:05.452
iffen you ain't offended
by entering a saloon.

02:02:14.584 --> 02:02:16.127
Sue.

02:02:20.590 --> 02:02:22.049
Doc.

02:02:22.091 --> 02:02:23.551
Bring him on up.

02:02:23.592 --> 02:02:25.803
Put him in there.
We'll make room.

02:02:33.477 --> 02:02:34.978
Baxter got any kin?

02:02:35.061 --> 02:02:36.938
Daughter is all he has left.

02:02:37.022 --> 02:02:39.900
It'd be right if somebody
explained things to her.

02:02:39.941 --> 02:02:43.069
There never was
any love lost between 'em.

02:02:43.111 --> 02:02:45.196
Even so, she's his daughter.

02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:48.074
And kin is funny
about such things.

02:03:01.878 --> 02:03:03.880
Come on.
Come on.

02:03:31.697 --> 02:03:33.782
I didn't mean for you
to have to...

02:03:33.825 --> 02:03:36.452
walk into this place
in front of those people.

02:03:36.493 --> 02:03:40.039
I don't care what anyone
out there thinks, Charley.

02:03:40.122 --> 02:03:42.667
You don't have to
stand up for me.

02:03:44.418 --> 02:03:45.460
Well, just the same,

02:03:45.543 --> 02:03:49.840
I wanted to tell you that I'll
be leaving in a day or two.

02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:58.973
I'd like you to stay.

02:03:59.055 --> 02:04:01.183
I think others would, too.

02:04:03.185 --> 02:04:05.813
I can't say I haven't
thought about it.

02:04:06.855 --> 02:04:08.481
Truth is, there wouldn't be
a corner here

02:04:08.565 --> 02:04:11.275
that don't have
a bad memory for me.

02:04:15.238 --> 02:04:18.532
I've been holding my love
a long time, Charley.

02:04:19.616 --> 02:04:22.661
I know you feel something
for me, too.

02:04:25.247 --> 02:04:26.832
I do.

02:04:29.376 --> 02:04:31.878
But I ain't no more
than those who come to kill us.

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:34.423
You seen that yourself.

02:04:34.505 --> 02:04:36.674
Maybe you've done
some bad things.

02:04:36.758 --> 02:04:38.176
Maybe worse than bad.

02:04:38.217 --> 02:04:41.512
But what happened here today
wasn't one of 'em.

02:04:45.265 --> 02:04:49.436
And those killings,
they don't give you pause?

02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:52.939
I'm not afraid of you, Charley.

02:05:09.954 --> 02:05:12.165
It brought me luck.

02:05:12.248 --> 02:05:13.918
Just like you said.

02:05:15.502 --> 02:05:17.420
It's yours now.

02:05:17.462 --> 02:05:19.047
You keep it.

02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:27.221
I don't have the answers,
Charley.

02:05:27.305 --> 02:05:29.766
But I know that people
get confused in this life

02:05:29.807 --> 02:05:34.853
about what they want
and what they've done

02:05:34.937 --> 02:05:38.022
and what they think they
should have because of it.

02:05:38.107 --> 02:05:42.443
Everything they think they are
or did takes hold so hard

02:05:42.527 --> 02:05:46.072
that it won't let them see
what they can be.

02:05:50.075 --> 02:05:52.912
I've got a big idea
about us, Charley.

02:05:54.330 --> 02:05:56.623
And I'm not gonna wait forever.

02:05:56.706 --> 02:05:58.625
But I am gonna wait.

02:05:58.708 --> 02:06:03.839
And when you're far away,
I want you to think about that.

02:06:04.798 --> 02:06:09.136
And... come back to me.

02:08:45.447 --> 02:08:47.574
I'm in love with you, Sue.

02:08:49.366 --> 02:08:52.411
Been that way since
I first laid eyes on you.

02:08:52.453 --> 02:08:57.082
Just took me a while
to see things clear.

02:08:58.959 --> 02:09:00.377
I know I'm not the kind of man

02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:02.920
you expected to walk up
your front walk.

02:09:03.921 --> 02:09:07.800
If I was your brother,
I wouldn't choose me for you.

02:09:13.096 --> 02:09:14.766
Charley...

02:09:17.185 --> 02:09:19.603
Do you know how old I am?

02:09:19.645 --> 02:09:22.773
Don't care how old you are.

02:09:22.814 --> 02:09:24.857
I'm not a girl anymore.

02:09:26.526 --> 02:09:29.696
You're the handsomest woman
I ever saw.

02:09:29.779 --> 02:09:32.449
I've had my disappointments,
Charley.

02:09:32.531 --> 02:09:34.658
Well, I'm not gonna be
one of them.

02:09:37.953 --> 02:09:40.748
I never thought I'd live
as long as I have, Sue.

02:09:40.830 --> 02:09:45.001
I guess living the way I have,
it never really mattered.

02:09:46.169 --> 02:09:49.839
But thinking I was never gonna
see you again was maybe...

02:09:51.508 --> 02:09:54.719
Was maybe the most awful feeling
I ever had in my life.

02:09:59.306 --> 02:10:03.852
I know I can be
a good husband to you.

02:10:04.978 --> 02:10:06.647
And I know I ain't
asked you proper.

02:10:06.688 --> 02:10:10.567
But I'm asking you now.

02:10:15.071 --> 02:10:17.532
Will you marry me, Sue?

02:10:20.827 --> 02:10:22.912
Charley.

02:10:22.994 --> 02:10:24.830
Yes.

02:10:25.665 --> 02:10:27.582
I'll marry you.

02:10:32.421 --> 02:10:34.463
And can I kiss you?

02:10:56.401 --> 02:11:00.363
I'm gonna give you a thousand
of these before I'm done.

02:11:22.468 --> 02:11:24.635
Hey, Charley!

02:11:24.719 --> 02:11:27.804
Looks like the doc
changed his mind about you.

02:11:34.478 --> 02:11:36.646
Something wrong?

02:11:36.730 --> 02:11:38.398
No.
Everything's fine.

02:11:38.482 --> 02:11:40.692
I forgot to tell you
I'll have word about the saloon

02:11:40.776 --> 02:11:41.735
by the time you get back.

02:11:41.818 --> 02:11:43.611
Sounds good.

02:11:45.322 --> 02:11:46.907
You take care, now.

02:11:48.492 --> 02:11:50.993
Charley.

02:11:51.078 --> 02:11:52.119
Sue.

02:11:52.203 --> 02:11:53.871
I'll be along.

02:11:58.959 --> 02:12:00.794
Saloon?

02:12:00.877 --> 02:12:03.797
Told you I was wanting out
of the cattle business.

02:12:03.881 --> 02:12:07.509
There's a saloon right back
there just had its owner die.

02:12:07.592 --> 02:12:09.510
Hoping you'd be my partner.

02:12:13.389 --> 02:12:16.183
I cant afford something like that.

02:12:16.226 --> 02:12:18.227
Not even half.

02:12:18.268 --> 02:12:21.854
Well let the brains of the outfith
do the thinking.

02:12:21.897 --> 02:12:23.995
Sue!

02:12:30.322 --> 02:12:34.158
You are coming back, aren't you?

02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:39.579
And i will be waiting for you Charles!

02:12:43.291 --> 02:12:48.630
Keep nothing private.

02:12:48.714 --> 02:12:53.968
Have to go back know.

02:12:54.010 --> 02:12:59.890
I don't want to loose side of the roof tops.

02:12:59.932 --> 02:13:05.062
I mean it Sue.

02:13:05.104 --> 02:13:10.151
Got to go!

02:13:10.191 --> 02:13:14.699
How this gonna work if
you don't do what i say.

02:13:24.997 --> 02:13:28.339
I told you, I'm gonna give you a
thousand of these before I'm done.

02:13:28.542 --> 02:13:30.836
I'm gonna make sure you do.

02:14:09.330 --> 02:14:11.248
Let's go get our cows!
