WEBVTT

00:06.840 --> 00:09.890
The hard drive is a backup
of my personal photo library.

00:10.090 --> 00:12.430
There's something about
these photos that's important.

00:12.630 --> 00:14.830
BILLINGS: Bring the hard drive
to Rock Creek Park.

00:15.030 --> 00:16.460
I'm the man asking
for that hard drive

00:16.660 --> 00:18.160
one last time.
NCIS.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.500
Who do you work for?
KASIE: <i>I finished processing</i>

00:20.700 --> 00:22.000
Senator Miller's
photo libraries,

00:22.200 --> 00:23.200
<i>and I might have found</i>

00:23.400 --> 00:25.000
<i>a connection to the Russians.</i>

00:25.200 --> 00:26.810
That's Delilah's
former T.A.

00:27.010 --> 00:28.710
Evelyn Shaw,
and the other two are

00:28.910 --> 00:31.080
Renée and John Watts.
We've recently arrested

00:31.280 --> 00:33.480
all three of these people for
being Russian sleeper spies.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.850
They were active volunteers
on Senator Miller's

00:36.050 --> 00:37.450
last reelection campaign.

00:37.650 --> 00:38.850
Four Russian spies?

00:39.050 --> 00:41.190
All with an interest
in the same U.S. senator?

00:41.390 --> 00:42.760
Doesn't sound
like a coincidence.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.570
Sounds like we need
to keep digging.

00:49.180 --> 00:51.330
GUS: <i>Glad you're here</i>
<i>for this, Susan.</i>

00:51.530 --> 00:54.000
'Cause the one thing
that we can't ever take lightly

00:54.200 --> 00:55.430
is moisture alerts.

00:55.630 --> 00:57.140
It's Gwen, actually.

00:57.340 --> 01:00.170
Granted, the sensors under
these floors are pretty old,

01:00.370 --> 01:03.310
so sometimes there's a delay,
or it might not go off at all.

01:03.510 --> 01:05.540
So when they warn
of increased humidity

01:05.740 --> 01:08.250
and liquid contamination,
it's up to us

01:08.450 --> 01:10.380
to check it out.
No spills allowed, got it.

01:10.580 --> 01:12.690
This is no mere library,
after all,

01:12.890 --> 01:14.990
but home of top
secret documents

01:15.190 --> 01:17.420
and files dating back
hundreds of years.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.660
And these files have
two enemies.

01:19.860 --> 01:22.930
Fire and water.
What about spies?

01:23.130 --> 01:24.300
And spies.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.800
Fire, water, spies.
Make that three.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.500
Which is why only folks
who have top-level

01:29.700 --> 01:31.970
security clearance
can get into this wing.

01:32.170 --> 01:33.410
We're talking federal agents,

01:33.610 --> 01:35.110
your legislative
committee members.

01:35.310 --> 01:37.110
And us janitors.

01:37.310 --> 01:40.210
We're not janitors, Gwen, we...

01:40.410 --> 01:42.920
are the Custodians of Classified

01:43.120 --> 01:44.930
History.
Cool.

01:46.070 --> 01:48.040
(gasps)

01:50.870 --> 01:53.810
* *

02:21.240 --> 02:23.470
(Torres speaking Spanish)

02:26.340 --> 02:28.330
Okay, okay, okay.

02:28.530 --> 02:30.800
<i>Te quiero.</i> Okay, <i>chao chao.</i>

02:31.000 --> 02:32.530
Oh, your mom
again, huh?

02:32.730 --> 02:34.630
Yeah, she...
What, what do you mean "again"?

02:34.830 --> 02:36.300
Oh, nothing. Just, you know,

02:36.500 --> 02:38.470
seems like you've been calling
her from work a lot lately.

02:38.670 --> 02:39.610
No, I haven't.

02:39.810 --> 02:41.040
Yeah, you have.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.940
Almost every day this week.

02:43.140 --> 02:44.540
Okay, what if I have?

02:44.740 --> 02:45.880
Well, nothing, it's
just, you know...

02:46.080 --> 02:48.110
PARKER:
So, check out these babies.

02:48.310 --> 02:49.620
A baker's dozen

02:49.820 --> 02:52.920
courtesy of the Cannoli King
of Mulberry Street.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.290
Help yourself.

02:54.490 --> 02:55.950
Ooh, who doesn't love a cannoli?

02:56.150 --> 02:57.720
And what son
doesn't call his mother?

02:57.920 --> 02:59.330
Shouldn't we all be calling
our parents more often?

02:59.530 --> 03:00.940
Depends on the parents.

03:01.740 --> 03:03.100
Yeah, I hope
you don't mind me asking.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.300
Oh...
Just, you know,
checking on you, Nick.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.730
It's fine.

03:06.930 --> 03:09.000
Yeah, we just want to
make sure you're okay.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.870
Have a cannoli.
Make you feel better.

03:12.070 --> 03:13.160
I feel fine.

03:15.420 --> 03:16.980
Although I did skip lunch.

03:17.180 --> 03:18.080
Mmm!

03:18.280 --> 03:19.510
Hangry.

03:19.710 --> 03:20.710
I'm a little hangry, yes.

03:20.910 --> 03:22.550
See, my timing's perfect.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.920
Yes, and, uh, cannolis
are like my kryptonite.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.950
Mm, from the Cannoli King,
no less.

03:27.150 --> 03:28.690
Yeah, King's
an old friend of mine

03:28.890 --> 03:30.320
in town on business.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.990
We're gonna grab dinner tonight.

03:32.190 --> 03:33.160
Barring, uh,

03:33.360 --> 03:36.060
any late-night cases
falling our way.

03:36.260 --> 03:38.360
Déjà vu, anyone?

03:38.560 --> 03:39.470
Seriously.

03:39.670 --> 03:40.700
What?

03:40.900 --> 03:42.770
What? We had almost

03:42.970 --> 03:45.540
this exact same conversation
over pastries two months ago.

03:45.740 --> 03:47.170
Oh, come on, this again?

03:47.370 --> 03:50.580
We're gonna go back to believing
in jinxes, just like that?

03:50.780 --> 03:52.710
Well, just like that,
you tempted fate,

03:52.910 --> 03:54.080
and a late-night case fell
in our lap

03:54.280 --> 03:55.850
when we were having
a really quiet day.

03:56.050 --> 03:58.350
Yeah, well, maybe this time
I'm tempting fate once again

03:58.550 --> 04:01.190
just to prove that
jinxes do not...

04:01.390 --> 04:02.320
(phones chiming)

04:02.520 --> 04:04.040
...do not exist.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.730
Body at the National Archives.
Mm-hmm.

04:06.930 --> 04:09.630
Well, in this case...

04:09.830 --> 04:11.060
I guess I would have to say,

04:11.260 --> 04:12.370
"Take the guns
and leave the, uh..."

04:12.570 --> 04:14.370
No. No <i>Godfather</i> quotes.

04:14.570 --> 04:16.300
But we are taking the cannolis.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.290
(humming)

04:19.990 --> 04:22.680
McGEE: Okay, our victim is
Navy Reserve Lieutenant

04:22.880 --> 04:24.640
and National Archives
security guard

04:24.840 --> 04:26.850
Louis Dacey,
42 years old.

04:27.050 --> 04:28.810
Yeah, his fellow employees
wondered why he didn't

04:29.010 --> 04:30.980
punch out last night
or show up to work today.

04:31.180 --> 04:33.990
He lives alone,
so no one reported him missing.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.660
Victim has a deep stab
wound under his armpit.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.320
Too soon for time of death?

04:38.520 --> 04:40.090
Well, I'll need
to take him back to autopsy

04:40.290 --> 04:41.630
in order to get
an exact time,

04:41.830 --> 04:43.530
but based on rigor mortis,
I'd say it's

04:43.730 --> 04:44.930
definitely yesterday.

04:45.130 --> 04:46.270
All right, we'll need
security cam footage

04:46.470 --> 04:47.500
and their, uh, visitor logs.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.000
Already being sent over.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.700
Looks like our killer
was doing some research

04:50.900 --> 04:52.670
on Russia
before the victim showed up.

04:52.870 --> 04:55.470
All right, we have clearance
to handle these files.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.180
Let's get a complete
inventory of what's

04:57.380 --> 04:58.840
here to see, what
might be missing.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.710
Yeesh. That's gonna
take a while.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.220
Well, in that case
I'd better cancel dinner.

05:04.420 --> 05:06.950
What, with the Cannoli King?
No way, no way.

05:07.150 --> 05:07.950
Yes way.

05:08.150 --> 05:10.020
Duty calls.
What about us?

05:10.220 --> 05:11.920
We're not off-duty.
Yeah, seriously.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.790
It's not like we haven't
gathered evidence

05:13.990 --> 05:15.960
or transported a dead body
a thousand times before.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.700
And you're always
reminding us to have

05:17.900 --> 05:20.130
a life outside of the job,
so, um,

05:20.330 --> 05:21.870
the same applies to you.

05:22.070 --> 05:23.570
You sure?

05:23.770 --> 05:25.690
Absolutely.
Say hi to the King.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.790
We'll call you
with any updates.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.990
And bring us back
more cannoli.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.110
(Knight groans)

05:36.310 --> 05:38.920
Really hope Parker forgets
the last thing I said to him.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.650
Yeah, me, too.
I'm a little cannoli'd out.

05:41.850 --> 05:42.790
Are you too cannoli'd out
to, uh,

05:42.990 --> 05:44.220
help me go
through these files?

05:44.420 --> 05:47.160
As soon as I upload
this Archives database.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.760
Can't know
what files are missing

05:48.960 --> 05:49.830
till we know what was there
to begin with.

05:50.030 --> 05:52.130
I just got their visitor log.

05:52.330 --> 05:53.730
42 people entered by way

05:53.930 --> 05:55.230
of their retinal scanner
yesterday.

05:55.430 --> 05:57.270
Well, that'll help us
narrow down our suspect.

05:57.470 --> 05:59.340
Now we just need
time of death.

05:59.540 --> 06:00.840
That sounds like my cue.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.880
Hey, you finished
the autopsy already?

06:03.080 --> 06:04.940
Yeah, well, the stab wound made

06:05.140 --> 06:06.240
a cause of death rather obvious.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.010
Victoria's waiting
on me to help her

06:08.210 --> 06:10.620
with a school project,
the old potato battery trick.

06:10.820 --> 06:12.080
She actually came up
with a new take

06:12.280 --> 06:14.220
on an old classic.
You know, so what she did was...

06:14.420 --> 06:15.950
Jimmy?
Yeah?

06:16.150 --> 06:17.990
Time of death?
Right.

06:18.190 --> 06:19.860
Uh, coagulation
within our victim's wound

06:20.060 --> 06:21.690
suggests the fatal thrust
was delivered

06:21.890 --> 06:23.360
roughly 30 hours ago.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.900
So about 6:30 last night?

06:25.100 --> 06:26.300
Yeah, give or take an hour.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.730
All right, now we'll cross-check

06:27.930 --> 06:29.330
that time against visitor logs.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.540
On it.
And I am out.

06:31.740 --> 06:33.210
Night, Jimmy.

06:33.410 --> 06:35.320
Night, Jess. I love you.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.730
And I love you, Nick.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.970
And I love you, Tim.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.700
Heck, I love all of you.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.740
Have a great night, everyone.

06:58.250 --> 07:01.300
According
to last night's visitor log,

07:01.500 --> 07:02.700
the only person
to enter

07:02.900 --> 07:04.340
that wing of
the Archives

07:04.540 --> 07:07.040
was Senator Constance Miller

07:07.240 --> 07:08.240
at 6:19 p.m.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.080
Can we just back up
a second here?

07:10.280 --> 07:11.980
For what?
McGEE: Wait, hold on.

07:12.180 --> 07:14.250
Uh, Nick, I would also like
to back this up, but first,

07:14.450 --> 07:16.650
Senator Miller? Wait.

07:16.850 --> 07:18.020
She was the one who was targeted

07:18.220 --> 07:19.350
by the Russian spy
about two months ago.

07:19.550 --> 07:21.150
Yes, the case with
the knockout gas.

07:21.350 --> 07:23.810
Eh, Parker's gonna want
to hear about this.

07:27.910 --> 07:29.290
Yeah, McGee, everything okay?

07:29.490 --> 07:31.830
Yeah, sorry to interrupt
your dinner, but, um...

07:32.030 --> 07:33.730
you remember Senator Miller?
She had the safe

07:33.930 --> 07:35.430
that the Russians
were trying to break into.

07:35.630 --> 07:37.100
Yeah, I remember. Uh, why?

07:37.300 --> 07:40.010
Well, visitor logs have her
at the Archives

07:40.210 --> 07:41.770
yesterday right around
the same time as the murder.

07:41.970 --> 07:43.810
Really?
Yeah.

07:44.010 --> 07:45.310
So, at the very least,
she could be a witness.

07:45.510 --> 07:47.010
Now we're gonna go pay her
a visit

07:47.210 --> 07:49.400
at her place
if you want to join us.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.290
Well, actually, I would, but...

07:53.490 --> 07:55.320
Oh, but if you're
still eating...

07:55.520 --> 07:57.090
No, no, it's not that.

07:57.290 --> 07:58.940
It's just...

08:00.910 --> 08:04.380
Um... you may not
find her there.

08:15.990 --> 08:19.440
I have no idea how my name
got on their visitor log.

08:19.650 --> 08:21.550
I haven't been
to the Archives in months.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.820
But you have been
there before?

08:24.020 --> 08:26.450
Well, research for committee
meetings is part of the job,

08:26.650 --> 08:28.320
so, yes, I...

08:28.520 --> 08:30.560
(inhales deeply)
I'm sorry.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.590
Am I actually a murder suspect?

08:33.790 --> 08:35.760
No, Senator, we were hoping
you'd be more of a witness.

08:35.960 --> 08:39.260
That said,
to officially clear you,

08:39.460 --> 08:41.100
we-we still need to know
where you were

08:41.300 --> 08:42.370
at the time of the murder.

08:42.570 --> 08:44.940
So, my alibi?

08:45.140 --> 08:46.520
Yeah.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.140
I was with a friend.

08:49.340 --> 08:51.140
Great. And that friend's name

08:51.340 --> 08:52.960
so we can corroborate?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.100
Do you want to take this one?

09:00.900 --> 09:03.720
She's not talking to me.
Or me.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.220
Um...

09:05.420 --> 09:08.690
She was at my place two nights
ago, same as last night.

09:08.890 --> 09:10.060
I knew it.

09:10.260 --> 09:11.530
I had a feeling this whole, uh,

09:11.730 --> 09:13.300
Cannoli King story was
a cover-up

09:13.500 --> 09:14.870
for something much better.

09:15.070 --> 09:16.500
And I had a feeling
when she gave you

09:16.700 --> 09:18.070
her card in my office.

09:18.270 --> 09:20.370
Okay, now that you two are
done airing your feelings,

09:20.570 --> 09:22.010
can we get her
out of there, please?

09:22.210 --> 09:24.490
I got some questions
about all of this.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.110
McGEE:
Kasie just sent this up.

09:28.310 --> 09:31.320
This is the precise moment
the senator's retinal ID

09:31.520 --> 09:33.590
was used to enter
the Top Secret Access Wing

09:33.790 --> 09:35.190
from the Archives lobby.

09:35.390 --> 09:37.220
You got to assume he's wearing
special contact lenses.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.420
Biometric technology
keeps getting better.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.760
Enough to perfectly match
my retina?

09:41.960 --> 09:43.430
It's like he stole
my eyes.

09:43.630 --> 09:45.330
You ever seen him before?

09:45.530 --> 09:47.230
Never, but don't
you guys have

09:47.430 --> 09:48.700
a bad guy database
or something?

09:48.900 --> 09:51.140
Kasie's running
facial recognition now.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.070
And as for how
he stole your eyes,

09:53.270 --> 09:56.040
he'll tell us that when we
catch him, whoever he is.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.680
Nate Billings might know.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.580
That Russian spy
we caught trying

09:59.780 --> 10:01.660
to break into the senator's
safe two months ago.

10:02.260 --> 10:04.680
Rule 39. No coincidences.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.250
First a Russian spy wants
the photos in her safe,

10:07.450 --> 10:09.120
then her retinal ID

10:09.320 --> 10:10.560
is used to steal

10:10.760 --> 10:12.120
classified documents
on Russia.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.560
And kill a security guard.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.430
Okay,
now I'm officially terrified.

10:15.630 --> 10:18.000
(watch chimes)
And late for a committee vote.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.780
Please tell me
you'll get this guy.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.400
Yeah, count on it.
I'll see you out.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.870
I know the way, Alden.

10:24.070 --> 10:26.420
Just catch this creep, okay?
Soon.

10:28.890 --> 10:30.440
Okay, then,
for starters,

10:30.640 --> 10:32.040
where do we find
this Billings guy?

10:32.240 --> 10:34.250
I'm already searching
his records, but, uh,

10:34.450 --> 10:36.280
first, the Cannoli King?

10:36.480 --> 10:38.250
Yeah, is that an actual person

10:38.450 --> 10:40.490
or just a steamy metaphor?

10:40.690 --> 10:42.520
The Cannoli King is very real.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.420
Constance, she's just...

10:44.620 --> 10:46.220
something else.

10:46.420 --> 10:47.790
She's a senator.

10:47.990 --> 10:50.400
Can we please get
back to the case?

10:50.600 --> 10:52.400
Weird, apparently Russia filed

10:52.600 --> 10:54.370
for extradition
after Billings' arrest,

10:54.570 --> 10:56.370
but the State Department
blocked it,

10:56.570 --> 10:58.070
angling for something in return.

10:58.270 --> 10:59.440
Where's Billings being held?

10:59.640 --> 11:01.970
That information is
"need to know."

11:02.170 --> 11:04.010
Well, we need to know.

11:04.210 --> 11:06.310
Won't the State Department
tell us?

11:06.510 --> 11:08.760
One way to find out.
Keep digging.

11:09.530 --> 11:11.150
This is great!
And about time, frankly.

11:11.350 --> 11:12.720
You finally told Knight.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.850
No, more like I blurted out

11:15.050 --> 11:17.020
my love for Jess in front
of the entire squad room.

11:17.220 --> 11:19.360
Yeah, but I still don't see
the problem.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.730
The problem is that Jess and I
have worked really hard

11:21.930 --> 11:23.430
to keep what we have
out of the office.

11:23.630 --> 11:26.500
She's not big on public displays
of affection. Neither am I.

11:26.700 --> 11:27.800
Well, what'd she say?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.200
I assume you called her
afterwards?

11:29.400 --> 11:30.600
Well, I was going to, but...

11:30.800 --> 11:32.300
when I didn't hear from her
right away,

11:32.500 --> 11:33.810
I started wondering.

11:34.010 --> 11:35.610
Wondering?

11:35.810 --> 11:37.210
If I really embarrassed her.

11:37.410 --> 11:39.280
Or worse yet, you know,
what if she doesn't

11:39.480 --> 11:40.750
feel the same?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.250
(laughs):
Oh, dear.

11:42.450 --> 11:44.150
Are we back
in junior high school already?

11:44.350 --> 11:45.480
Oh, I love it.

11:45.680 --> 11:46.920
I know how crazy it sounds,
all right?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.990
But it's just
where my mind goes.

11:49.190 --> 11:50.360
(computer chimes)

11:50.560 --> 11:52.190
Speaking of crazy.

11:52.390 --> 11:53.330
Still no match.

11:53.530 --> 11:56.260
On every local,
global, criminal,

11:56.460 --> 11:58.100
and civilian database we've got.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.520
We are looking at a ghost.

12:01.820 --> 12:02.740
GRECO:
<i>Our State Department database</i>

12:02.940 --> 12:04.970
is the same as yours, gentlemen.

12:05.170 --> 12:07.840
Doubt we'd have any luck trying
to identify your killer.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.370
Well, it's more
the Russian connection

12:09.570 --> 12:10.810
that we're wondering about.

12:11.010 --> 12:13.150
Which is why we'd like
to talk to Nate Billings.

12:13.350 --> 12:14.580
We understand that you

12:14.780 --> 12:16.610
blocked Russia's bid
for his extradition?

12:16.820 --> 12:18.680
Yeah, I-I can confirm that.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.390
Our efforts
to, uh, broker a deal

12:20.590 --> 12:22.190
to get something
in return for Billings

12:22.390 --> 12:23.690
went nowhere.

12:23.890 --> 12:25.520
That was, until this morning.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.990
And what happened
this morning?

12:28.190 --> 12:29.830
At 0600 today,

12:30.030 --> 12:32.430
the Kremlin offered
to release four international

12:32.630 --> 12:34.470
political prisoners in exchange

12:34.670 --> 12:37.240
for these convicted
Russian spies.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.070
John and Renée Watts, currently

12:39.270 --> 12:40.740
on a flight to Moscow
in exchange

12:40.940 --> 12:42.610
for two Canadian prisoners.

12:42.810 --> 12:45.310
Evelyn Shaw, transporting

12:45.510 --> 12:47.810
tomorrow in exchange
for an American prisoner.

12:48.010 --> 12:49.820
And Billings, the one
that you're looking for,

12:50.020 --> 12:51.880
he's scheduled
to transport later today

12:52.080 --> 12:53.290
for a British prisoner.

12:53.490 --> 12:55.050
Stu, if I could interrupt
you just for a second...

12:55.250 --> 12:57.390
I prefer Counselor,
Agent Parker,

12:57.590 --> 12:59.460
or Mr. Greco, if you will.

12:59.660 --> 13:02.190
We State Department lawyers like
to keep things professional.

13:02.390 --> 13:05.330
Yeah, of course, Counselor,
but you are aware

13:05.530 --> 13:07.800
that all four of these spies
were arrested separately

13:08.000 --> 13:10.470
by our team
in the last six months?

13:10.670 --> 13:12.500
Well, then you're doing
a hell of a job.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.870
But given that, on top
of our break-in at the Archives

13:16.070 --> 13:18.510
and now with the timing
of this Russian deal,

13:18.710 --> 13:20.480
how does that
not sound suspicious?

13:20.680 --> 13:24.280
And what is suspicious about
a four-for-four prisoner swap?

13:24.480 --> 13:26.050
With no ulterior motive?

13:26.250 --> 13:27.950
All right, trust me,
gentlemen, we are actively

13:28.150 --> 13:29.860
investigating
every angle of this.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.190
But the international effort
to get our citizens released

13:32.390 --> 13:34.860
from... whatever
Russian gulag they're in

13:35.060 --> 13:37.300
has been going on for years.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.830
That's all well and fine, but...

13:39.030 --> 13:40.500
But ulterior motives or not,

13:40.700 --> 13:44.370
gentlemen, this makes this deal
only one thing to me...

13:44.570 --> 13:47.390
and that's too good to pass up.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.390
(speaking Spanish)

13:53.500 --> 13:55.630
Okay. <i>Chao chao.</i>

13:57.430 --> 13:59.520
Hey, for the record,
that was my sister.

13:59.720 --> 14:00.820
Not my mom.

14:01.020 --> 14:02.150
And she's doing fine.

14:02.350 --> 14:04.660
Good to hear.
Yeah, that's great.

14:04.860 --> 14:06.590
Now, the-the part
I don't understand still

14:06.790 --> 14:07.990
is all the secrecy.

14:08.190 --> 14:09.360
Dude, secrecy? I just said...

14:09.560 --> 14:11.600
No, not you. Cannoli King.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.700
Oh.
They're consenting adults,

14:13.900 --> 14:15.300
so what's with
all the sneaking around?

14:15.500 --> 14:17.170
Well, I don't think
it's sneaking around.

14:17.370 --> 14:19.170
I think it's more
professional discretion.

14:19.370 --> 14:21.010
You know, keeping
one's personal life

14:21.210 --> 14:22.940
completely out of the workplace.

14:23.140 --> 14:24.680
Mm, speaking of which,

14:24.880 --> 14:26.540
you and Jimmy?

14:26.740 --> 14:28.550
What about us?

14:28.750 --> 14:30.480
Oh, are you gonna pretend
it didn't happen?

14:30.680 --> 14:32.780
Uh, and what's that?

14:32.990 --> 14:34.920
That Jimmy didn't
completely throw

14:35.120 --> 14:37.290
professional discretion
out the window last night?

14:37.490 --> 14:38.720
It was pretty epic.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.860
Oh, well, you know,
if I had any idea

14:41.060 --> 14:42.900
what either
of you were talking about...

14:43.100 --> 14:44.560
Oh, would you cut the act?

14:44.760 --> 14:46.300
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.130
You just don't want
to acknowledge it in here.

14:48.330 --> 14:51.170
No, Nick, Nick,
"professional discretion."

14:51.370 --> 14:54.190
Okay. Damn, you're good.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.080
I need us all to be good
'cause we have a problem.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.140
Why, what's up?
We may not know

14:59.340 --> 15:02.000
that guy, but you might
recognize these faces.

15:03.730 --> 15:04.950
There's Nate Billings again.

15:05.150 --> 15:06.780
Yeah, those are the fake parents

15:06.990 --> 15:09.050
from that Russian spy girl.
McGEE:
Yeah, and who could forget

15:09.250 --> 15:12.260
Evelyn,
Delilah's T.A.-turned-spy?

15:12.460 --> 15:14.330
All Russian spies
arrested by us,

15:14.530 --> 15:15.890
and now all suddenly headed back

15:16.090 --> 15:17.860
to Russia
in a prisoner exchange.

15:18.060 --> 15:19.800
Right after
our mystery man breaks

15:20.000 --> 15:21.800
into the National Archives?
Exactly.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.870
Given the timing,
they have to be connected.

15:24.070 --> 15:25.970
In ways that I shudder
to think about.

15:26.170 --> 15:28.610
Parker,
could you believe that guy?

15:28.810 --> 15:30.740
Did, uh, Counselor Greco

15:30.940 --> 15:32.580
at least give you
Billings' location?

15:32.780 --> 15:34.310
Far too reluctantly.

15:34.510 --> 15:36.850
He's being transported
on the USS <i>Cortland.</i>

15:37.050 --> 15:38.880
It's about three hours
off our coast.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.190
Can we get on it?
Pulled some strings.

15:41.390 --> 15:43.920
There's a supply chopper
leaving in a half an hour.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.360
It can carry two agents
to the ship before

15:46.560 --> 15:48.260
Billings gets delivered
to the Russians.

15:48.460 --> 15:50.200
I'm in.
Me, too.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.560
Good.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.530
So the State Department
really doesn't see a threat?

15:53.730 --> 15:56.300
Their attorney seems a bit
too distracted with his...

15:56.500 --> 15:59.270
"too good to pass up" deal
to see much of anything.

15:59.470 --> 16:01.840
So if the Russians are
planning something big...

16:02.040 --> 16:05.060
It'll be up to us alone
to stop it.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.560
I understand
not talking about it

16:22.760 --> 16:25.200
in the squad room, but we
are on international waters.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.530
And still
technically at work.

16:27.730 --> 16:29.570
Come on, Knight, just tell me.

16:29.770 --> 16:31.470
(laughs)
Okay, I'll make a deal.

16:31.670 --> 16:34.440
You stop asking me
about whatever Jimmy said.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.710
Oh, you know what he said.

16:35.910 --> 16:37.180
And I won't ask
why you got touchy

16:37.380 --> 16:38.480
about your mom the other day.

16:38.680 --> 16:39.580
I didn't get touchy.

16:39.780 --> 16:41.960
Then I guess
we're done talking.

16:44.530 --> 16:45.680
Got to make it fast, Agents.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.540
Chopper heads back
in ten minutes.

16:49.070 --> 16:50.920
It's the Dream Team.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.530
I was hoping I'd see
you two again before I go.

16:53.730 --> 16:55.360
We don't have a
lot of time, Nate.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.400
If that's
your actual real name.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.800
Look, NCIS might

17:00.000 --> 17:01.870
be responsible for
landing me in prison,

17:02.070 --> 17:05.040
but at least
I'm finally headed home.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.140
So here's one last chance

17:07.340 --> 17:09.970
for you to tell us why
you targeted the senator.

17:10.180 --> 17:11.910
Now, that's adorable.

17:12.110 --> 17:15.710
And while I hardly expect
a hero's welcome since

17:15.910 --> 17:18.420
I obviously fell short
of my objective,

17:18.620 --> 17:20.250
I do know
my country will reward me

17:20.450 --> 17:21.990
for not betraying my mission.

17:22.190 --> 17:23.920
Should we even bother?

17:24.120 --> 17:25.820
I mean, give it a try.

17:26.020 --> 17:27.490
Try what?

17:27.690 --> 17:29.940
What else have you got?

17:31.280 --> 17:33.870
We have got a mystery man

17:34.070 --> 17:36.130
who broke
into the National Archives

17:36.330 --> 17:38.170
two days ago.

17:38.370 --> 17:40.240
Killed a guard,
stole some files.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.110
Any idea who he is?

17:42.310 --> 17:43.980
No.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.210
I... I don't know.

17:46.410 --> 17:48.210
You don't know?

17:48.410 --> 17:49.650
Or you don't know

17:49.850 --> 17:51.880
how he got
the senator's retinal scan?

17:52.080 --> 17:54.490
I've never seen him.

17:54.690 --> 17:56.590
You know what would be
adorable, too?

17:56.790 --> 17:58.890
If we believed you.

17:59.090 --> 18:01.560
Where did you get that picture?
KNIGHT:
Oh, I just told you.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.680
He broke into the Archives,
and his name is...?

18:07.220 --> 18:08.920
Yuri.

18:10.450 --> 18:12.040
It's just Yuri.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.760
He was my handler.

18:14.820 --> 18:16.010
I guess he had to take matters

18:16.210 --> 18:18.240
into his own hands
after I failed.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.040
Failed what?

18:20.250 --> 18:22.410
Getting the senator's
hard drive.

18:22.610 --> 18:24.620
Why did you want it?

18:24.820 --> 18:27.290
What was Yuri looking for
in the Archives?

18:27.490 --> 18:28.850
I don't know. I'm a chess piece.

18:29.050 --> 18:30.690
I do my job,
I don't ask questions.

18:30.890 --> 18:33.490
We just wasted three hours
on a helicopter ride for this.

18:33.690 --> 18:35.860
I will tell you anything else.

18:36.060 --> 18:37.300
My real name?

18:37.500 --> 18:39.050
You really want to know?

18:40.220 --> 18:42.000
So now you want to talk?

18:42.200 --> 18:44.470
If Yuri is involved now
in the field,

18:44.670 --> 18:46.850
doing his own dirty work...

18:47.890 --> 18:49.440
...I'm much better off here.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.240
That's up
to the State Department.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.510
Well, then you talk to them.

18:52.710 --> 18:54.460
(beeping)
(knocking)

18:55.260 --> 18:56.750
Wheels up in two.

18:56.950 --> 18:58.720
Or let me talk to them, please?

18:58.920 --> 19:00.390
Yeah, we'll,
we'll do what we can.

19:00.590 --> 19:02.620
Please. I'd really rather stay.

19:02.820 --> 19:04.060
Yeah, we hear you, man.
Hang in there.

19:04.260 --> 19:06.420
No, I mean it.
It won't go well for me there.

19:06.620 --> 19:07.930
I know it won't!

19:08.130 --> 19:09.060
(door closes)

19:09.260 --> 19:10.560
You know,
when Piper and I split,

19:10.760 --> 19:12.900
she said we were living proof
of the old saying

19:13.100 --> 19:14.900
"never go to the bathroom
where you eat."

19:15.100 --> 19:17.370
That's the PG version,
obviously.

19:17.570 --> 19:19.170
Well, Jess and I are not
splitting up,

19:19.370 --> 19:20.340
at least I hope not.

19:20.540 --> 19:21.570
You guys still
haven't talked yet?

19:21.770 --> 19:22.610
Haven't been able
to reach her.

19:22.810 --> 19:23.980
Probably because

19:24.180 --> 19:25.740
she's still on a chopper
over the Atlantic.

19:25.940 --> 19:27.550
But if you want an opinion

19:27.750 --> 19:30.430
on workplace romance,
call my ex-wife.

19:31.130 --> 19:33.750
How about the senator?
How about an update?

19:33.950 --> 19:35.590
Well played.
JIMMY:
First of all,

19:35.790 --> 19:37.090
uh, we're pretty sure
the killer most likely...

19:37.290 --> 19:39.720
Yuri.
We now know his name is Yuri.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.860
That Yuri likely tossed
so many files

19:42.060 --> 19:44.830
and documents around in order to
better conceal the one he took.

19:45.030 --> 19:46.800
And do we know
which file that is?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.370
Only by its title:
"Russian defector

19:49.570 --> 19:51.800
Ilya Sokolov, 1985."

19:52.000 --> 19:54.770
(sighs)
What would Yuri want
with an old defector?

19:54.970 --> 19:56.470
Do we know where
this guy is now?

19:56.670 --> 19:58.210
Is he even alive?

19:58.410 --> 20:01.210
The answers to those questions
are likely in the missing file.

20:01.410 --> 20:02.680
And now in the hands of Yuri.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.270
(phone chimes)

20:06.470 --> 20:08.670
Wherever he is, find him.

20:10.940 --> 20:13.190
GRECO:
Damn it, Director,
that is just unacceptable!

20:13.390 --> 20:16.030
I simply cannot believe
you would go behind my back

20:16.230 --> 20:18.000
and meddle
in my Russian prisoner exchange.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.330
Cool your jets, Counselor.
NCIS has every right

20:20.530 --> 20:23.100
to follow up with any convict
that we captured.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.800
Yet you have no right
to just send in agents

20:26.000 --> 20:27.810
who ruined everything!

20:28.010 --> 20:30.110
Whoa, whoa, easy! Let's
at least wait till our agents

20:30.310 --> 20:32.380
get back from the ship
before accusing them

20:32.580 --> 20:33.680
of killing your deal.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.480
Well, that's
a nice choice of words.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.010
What?

20:37.210 --> 20:39.850
Apparently, Nate Billings
was just found hanging

20:40.050 --> 20:42.050
from a bedsheet in
his holding cell.

20:42.250 --> 20:43.960
GRECO:
There's nothing
"apparently" about it.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.090
Billings killed himself after
whatever your agents told him.

20:47.290 --> 20:49.560
Our agents reported
that Billings got spooked

20:49.760 --> 20:51.400
when he saw that photo of Yuri.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.060
Oh, please...

20:53.260 --> 20:55.330
I'm sympathetic
to your murder case,

20:55.530 --> 20:57.600
but enough with this
mysterious Yuri character.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.270
Are you serious, pal?

20:59.470 --> 21:01.410
What I'm serious about, pal,

21:01.610 --> 21:04.080
is avoiding
an international crisis.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.380
Luckily, the Watts couple
are on a flight now.

21:06.580 --> 21:07.880
They just landed in Moscow,

21:08.080 --> 21:09.710
and the Canadians are
gonna get their prisoners.

21:09.910 --> 21:11.680
And what about Evelyn,
where's she?

21:11.880 --> 21:13.320
What, you, you think
I would tell you?

21:13.520 --> 21:15.850
With Billings dead, I'd be
damned if I let you two meddle

21:16.050 --> 21:17.150
with my last bargaining chip.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.020
Well, we got other places
to be, so...

21:19.220 --> 21:20.590
Well, not me. I'm, I'm
gonna stay right here

21:20.790 --> 21:22.310
until the agents come.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.810
Like hell you are.

21:26.650 --> 21:28.130
Yeah, send security.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.750
The big guys.

21:30.650 --> 21:32.140
You're throwing me out?

21:32.340 --> 21:34.620
Unless you'd rather walk.

21:35.890 --> 21:38.660
You'll be hearing
from my bosses.

21:42.730 --> 21:44.450
First of all,
"the big guys"?

21:44.650 --> 21:45.880
That was a nice touch.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.050
Eh, well.

21:47.250 --> 21:48.850
And I can't believe Billings.

21:49.050 --> 21:51.420
Yeah, choosing death
over facing this Yuri guy?

21:51.620 --> 21:53.830
Which is why I'll be hearing
from that blowhard's bosses.

21:54.030 --> 21:56.190
I don't know how much longer
I can run interference.
(phone chimes)

21:56.390 --> 21:58.000
PARKER:
Won't need it, hopefully.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.150
All right, in the meantime...
keep meddling.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.200
Hey, Ducky.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.700
Ah. (chuckles)

22:05.900 --> 22:07.970
Greetings from Edinburgh,
Timothy.

22:08.170 --> 22:11.480
And it's good to see you, too,
Agent Parker.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.480
Back to your homeland, Ducky?

22:13.680 --> 22:15.480
Well, it's stop number 14

22:15.680 --> 22:18.350
in my 35-city lecture tour.

22:18.550 --> 22:21.190
Scotland is just as lovely
as when I left it.

22:21.390 --> 22:23.050
It's my next vacation spot.
Can't wait.

22:23.250 --> 22:24.920
I was just telling
Dr. Mallard

22:25.120 --> 22:26.690
about the missing file
on Ilya Sokolov.

22:26.890 --> 22:28.760
He actually
remembers him.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.030
Ah, from the old NIS days.

22:31.230 --> 22:33.770
Sokolov was
a brilliant scientist.

22:33.970 --> 22:36.270
He was widely considered to be

22:36.470 --> 22:39.970
the top polymath
in the former Soviet Union.

22:40.170 --> 22:43.240
The Soviets put him
to work in every field until

22:43.440 --> 22:46.910
the Berlin Wall came down,
then he defected,

22:47.110 --> 22:49.710
changed his name and pursued

22:49.910 --> 22:52.620
a quiet life
as a college professor.

22:52.820 --> 22:54.050
You recall where, Duck?

22:54.250 --> 22:56.350
Well, last I heard,
he was teaching

22:56.550 --> 22:58.760
in a small town called Towson.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.560
Well, he'd be retired by now.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.560
And how about the name change?

23:03.760 --> 23:05.730
Yeah, what was it?

23:05.930 --> 23:08.670
Something
from an old television show.

23:08.870 --> 23:10.700
Kuryakin.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.940
Ivan Kuryakin.

23:13.140 --> 23:15.840
I remember that show.
Thanks, Duck.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.510
You're still the best, Duck.

23:17.710 --> 23:20.040
Oh, I do what I can.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.100
(chuckles)

23:25.070 --> 23:26.480
PARKER:
Mr. Kuryakin?

23:26.680 --> 23:28.140
(man speaking Russian on radio)

23:31.970 --> 23:34.410
(door opens)

23:35.280 --> 23:37.340
McGEE:
Parker.

23:46.590 --> 23:48.170
Dead. And still warm.

23:48.370 --> 23:50.140
Damn.

23:50.340 --> 23:52.440
Poor old man was
tortured to death.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.610
(faucet squeaks)

23:53.810 --> 23:56.000
(whistling nearby)

24:11.250 --> 24:13.880
NCIS.
Come out of the shower.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.800
Ah. Yuri.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.270
Valkov, yes.

24:21.470 --> 24:22.810
Yuri Valkov.

24:23.010 --> 24:24.460
Get your hands up.

24:25.930 --> 24:28.810
Oh, man. How'd I miss that?

24:29.010 --> 24:30.310
Get on the ground.

24:30.510 --> 24:31.650
Actually, do you mind

24:31.850 --> 24:34.040
if I go back in there
and rinse this off?

24:44.980 --> 24:46.760
Contact lenses may have
helped you fool

24:46.960 --> 24:48.570
the Archives'
retinal scanner, Yuri,

24:48.770 --> 24:51.040
but fingerprints don't lie.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.200
It's no wonder
facial rec gave us nothing,

24:53.400 --> 24:55.240
since your oligarch daddy spent

24:55.440 --> 24:58.280
millions keeping his golden boy
off everyone's radar

24:58.480 --> 24:59.840
and thinking he's above the law.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.910
I do come
from a successful family.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.080
But "oligarchs"?

25:05.280 --> 25:08.290
It's nothing more
but tacky American propaganda.

25:08.490 --> 25:10.620
Yeah, and how about breaking
into the National Archives

25:10.820 --> 25:12.990
to find and kill
an old Russian defector?

25:13.190 --> 25:14.490
Is that propaganda, too?

25:14.690 --> 25:16.490
I'll confess to that.

25:16.690 --> 25:18.860
Sokolov was a traitor.

25:19.060 --> 25:21.670
And the poor security guard,
he was just

25:21.870 --> 25:25.590
a hapless victim of bad timing.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.470
What?

25:29.670 --> 25:31.810
You don't like my confession?

25:32.010 --> 25:33.960
I don't like you.

25:35.130 --> 25:36.580
And I'm trying to fathom
why Billings

25:36.780 --> 25:38.920
would kill himself
rather than face you.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.620
He was weak.

25:40.820 --> 25:42.750
That's what weak men do.

25:42.950 --> 25:45.160
He called you his handler.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.390
What were you handling?

25:47.590 --> 25:50.190
What's the bigger plan?

25:50.390 --> 25:51.800
(sighs)

25:52.000 --> 25:54.370
The bigger plan is
for me to go to prison

25:54.570 --> 25:56.750
and serve my time.

25:57.650 --> 25:59.990
Nothing left to handle.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.410
"Nothing left to handle"?

26:04.610 --> 26:06.240
I don't like
the sound of that.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.210
Whatever his mission was,

26:08.410 --> 26:10.010
for him to give up so easily

26:10.210 --> 26:12.820
means it's already
been accomplished.

26:13.020 --> 26:15.120
(phones chime)

26:15.320 --> 26:16.820
It's Jimmy.

26:17.020 --> 26:18.920
I'll go.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.990
JIMMY:
Based on these bruises
and burns,

26:21.190 --> 26:23.700
Sokolov was clearly tortured,
but that's not what killed him.

26:23.900 --> 26:26.000
Just like
the Archives' security guard,

26:26.200 --> 26:27.260
there's a deep stab wound

26:27.460 --> 26:29.100
straight through
Sokolov's aorta.

26:29.300 --> 26:30.870
Well, I'm no torture expert,

26:31.070 --> 26:32.400
but Yuri wouldn't
finish a guy off

26:32.600 --> 26:34.040
until after he got
what he wanted.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.740
Well, whatever he wanted,

26:35.940 --> 26:37.470
he could've sent
to Russia right then.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.440
Hopefully Kasie can unlock
his cell phone.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.630
Yeah, I'll go check it out.

26:42.430 --> 26:43.280
I love you, Jimmy.

26:43.480 --> 26:46.450
You're a funny man, Nick Torres.

26:46.650 --> 26:48.020
Hey, you know I'm
kidding, right?

26:48.220 --> 26:50.290
Yeah, and I deserve it
after embarrassing myself

26:50.490 --> 26:51.690
and Jess.

26:51.890 --> 26:54.290
Well, she wouldn't discuss it
either.

26:54.490 --> 26:56.290
Believe me, I tried.

26:56.490 --> 26:57.660
Oh, no.

26:57.860 --> 26:58.930
What do you mean "oh, no"?

26:59.130 --> 27:00.970
You didn't say anything
that wasn't true.

27:01.170 --> 27:02.900
Life is too short,

27:03.100 --> 27:05.440
and we don't say it
enough anyways.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.970
Hey, look, I know.

27:07.170 --> 27:09.740
Guess I just had a much
different image in my head

27:09.940 --> 27:11.780
of how I would say it to Jess
for the first time.

27:11.980 --> 27:13.710
Well, that time will come again.

27:13.910 --> 27:16.250
Don't beat yourself up for it.

27:16.450 --> 27:18.080
Wow.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.420
"Wow"?

27:19.620 --> 27:21.520
It's just usually me saying

27:21.720 --> 27:22.720
stuff like that.

27:22.920 --> 27:23.920
Hey, I got wisdom,
too, man.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.390
I know you do--
I-- it's just,

27:25.590 --> 27:27.090
lately you've been
a little, uh...

27:27.290 --> 27:29.810
Well, you've been calling
your mother a lot.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.530
Bro, again with my mom?

27:32.730 --> 27:35.200
McGee and Knight are on me
about that, too.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.830
Yeah, what'd you tell 'em?

27:37.030 --> 27:37.770
Nothing.

27:37.970 --> 27:40.720
Do you want to tell me?

27:43.360 --> 27:44.540
(clears throat)
I don't know.

27:44.740 --> 27:46.680
Maybe, maybe it's all these

27:46.880 --> 27:49.380
immigration cases
we've been working on

27:49.580 --> 27:51.220
in the last couple of months.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.020
Made me a little sentimental?

27:53.220 --> 27:55.720
I've just been thinking
about the sacrifices

27:55.920 --> 27:58.690
that Mom made for me
and my sister, that's all.

27:58.890 --> 28:00.420
Very understandable.

28:00.620 --> 28:02.340
Why not tell McGee and Jess?

28:03.140 --> 28:06.100
I guess I just didn't realize it
until they asked.

28:06.300 --> 28:08.370
I'm also holding out until
Knight says she loves you back.

28:08.570 --> 28:09.400
(laughs)
Oh, Nick,

28:09.600 --> 28:11.040
please don't say anything...

28:11.240 --> 28:12.670
Hey, I'm kidding. Relax.

28:12.870 --> 28:15.220
Believe me,
I will gladly stay out of it.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.340
For now.

28:18.540 --> 28:19.940
(door opens)

28:20.140 --> 28:22.850
I was able to access Yuri's
call history, and, sure enough,

28:23.050 --> 28:25.280
he made a bunch of calls
in the last two days

28:25.480 --> 28:28.750
to a number with the telltale
Russian country code.

28:28.950 --> 28:30.790
So whatever info
Sokolov gave Yuri,

28:30.990 --> 28:32.490
he relayed straight to Russia.

28:32.690 --> 28:35.060
Mm-hmm, as far as his photos,

28:35.260 --> 28:37.590
whatever Yuri has them
encrypted with,

28:37.800 --> 28:40.260
it's nothing
I've ever seen before.

28:40.460 --> 28:41.600
Yeah, same here.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.200
I think I'm almost in, though.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.770
So, Jess?

28:45.970 --> 28:47.100
Talk to Jimmy lately?

28:47.300 --> 28:49.510
(clears throat)
Uh, no, Kasie.

28:49.710 --> 28:52.440
I haven't really had the chance
in the last 36 hours.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.610
You know, with all
the helicopter rides

28:54.810 --> 28:56.750
and Russian spies killing
themselves. (chuckles)

28:56.950 --> 28:58.250
Oh, yeah, sure,
your typical workday,

28:58.450 --> 28:59.950
Got it.
(laughs)

29:00.150 --> 29:02.320
Just as long
as you're not mad at Jimmy.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.520
What? No, I'm...

29:04.720 --> 29:06.790
not mad at anyone.

29:06.990 --> 29:08.860
I do kind of wish
people would stop asking me

29:09.060 --> 29:10.800
about what Jimmy may
or may not have blurted.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.160
Oh, he blurted it.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.670
Aren't those photos
unlocked yet?

29:14.870 --> 29:15.870
Uh...
(computer chimes)

29:16.070 --> 29:18.350
Ooh, as a matter of fact,
they are.

29:19.420 --> 29:20.840
KASIE:
Looks like

29:21.040 --> 29:23.320
top secret
National Archive files.

29:24.260 --> 29:25.240
KNIGHT:
Oh, wait.

29:25.440 --> 29:26.380
What are those here?

29:26.580 --> 29:27.950
Is that Senator Miller?

29:28.150 --> 29:29.130
(types)

29:31.800 --> 29:34.290
Wait, didn't she tell us that
she'd never seen Yuri before?

29:34.490 --> 29:35.820
She sure did.

29:36.020 --> 29:37.620
Maybe this is what
Billings meant about Yuri

29:37.820 --> 29:39.090
taking matters
into his own hands.

29:39.290 --> 29:41.060
Well, at least now
we know how Yuri was able

29:41.260 --> 29:43.560
to forge the senator's
retinal ID.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.700
Take a look
at this high-res shot.

29:45.900 --> 29:48.430
There's software on the dark web

29:48.630 --> 29:51.470
that can reproduce those eyes
with fingerprint accuracy.

29:51.670 --> 29:53.040
Well, that would explain it.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.910
But now we got
an even bigger problem.

29:55.110 --> 29:57.740
If Parker's new squeeze
is cozying up to Yuri,

29:57.940 --> 30:00.310
could she be a Russian asset?

30:00.510 --> 30:02.080
Well, if she is,
I sure don't want to be the one

30:02.280 --> 30:03.400
to tell Parker.

30:05.170 --> 30:07.170
Really?

30:08.570 --> 30:09.950
(Parker sighs)

30:10.150 --> 30:10.920
No.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.420
Leon, there's no way.

30:12.620 --> 30:15.460
No way she could be
manipulating you for cover?

30:15.660 --> 30:17.830
For intel?
To serve as her alibi?

30:18.030 --> 30:19.860
She's not
<i>The Manchurian Candidate.</i>

30:20.060 --> 30:22.100
Yeah, but she did make
the first move.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.270
She gave you her card
in my office.

30:24.470 --> 30:26.240
Which proves my point.
What Russian asset

30:26.440 --> 30:27.740
would be so obvious?

30:27.940 --> 30:30.360
Only one way to find out.

30:31.390 --> 30:32.510
Me?
Mm-hmm.

30:32.710 --> 30:33.680
Yeah.

30:33.880 --> 30:35.380
But shouldn't I recuse myself?

30:35.580 --> 30:37.850
Given our prior... you know.

30:38.050 --> 30:39.450
Oh, it's your prior "you know"

30:39.650 --> 30:42.020
that might just get her
to confide in you.

30:42.220 --> 30:43.490
(sighs)

30:43.690 --> 30:45.060
Still, I was thinking, uh,

30:45.260 --> 30:47.420
maybe McGee
or really anyone but...

30:47.620 --> 30:49.880
Nope. She's all yours.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.030
Oh, man, this is
gonna be so good.

31:07.230 --> 31:08.910
(sighs)

31:09.110 --> 31:11.300
Thanks for coming in, Senator.

31:12.730 --> 31:15.140
So, it's "Senator" now?

31:19.270 --> 31:21.880
What can I do for you, Agent?

31:25.150 --> 31:26.400
His name is Yuri Valkov.

31:26.600 --> 31:30.270
You might recognize him
as the man who used

31:30.470 --> 31:34.240
your retinal ID to break
into the National Archives.

31:34.440 --> 31:35.540
So you got him?

31:35.740 --> 31:37.110
We did.

31:37.310 --> 31:41.310
But only after you said
you'd never seen him before.

31:41.510 --> 31:43.280
So I'm, uh...

31:43.480 --> 31:46.100
I'm sure there's
a good explanation.

31:48.970 --> 31:51.890
Well, I certainly
recognize the outfit.

31:52.090 --> 31:54.060
I wore it
to a recent fundraiser.

31:54.260 --> 31:55.930
Thousand dollars a plate.

31:56.130 --> 31:59.230
But you still
don't recognize him?

31:59.430 --> 32:01.970
Do you know how many photos
I posed for that night?

32:02.170 --> 32:04.270
How many hundreds of donors?

32:04.470 --> 32:06.300
Then you don't know him?

32:06.500 --> 32:08.970
Of course I don't.

32:09.170 --> 32:12.080
But I can comb
through the donor files

32:12.280 --> 32:17.250
and see if there's any record
of him, if that helps.

32:17.450 --> 32:18.830
It would help.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.690
You understand...

32:21.890 --> 32:23.390
I know you're just doing
your job, Alden,

32:23.590 --> 32:26.560
but that doesn't make it
any less hurtful

32:26.760 --> 32:28.460
that you would doubt me.

32:28.660 --> 32:29.960
But I don't doubt you.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.160
Like you said,
I'm just doing my job.

32:32.360 --> 32:33.970
MILLER:
There's doing your job, Alden...
Okay.

32:34.170 --> 32:36.200
...and then there's
accusing me of...

32:36.400 --> 32:37.630
Well, now I just feel dirty.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.500
Yeah. Me, too.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.820
(phone chimes)
Yeah, we shouldn't
even be here.

32:43.590 --> 32:44.910
What the hell?

32:45.110 --> 32:46.590
KNIGHT:
What is it, Director?

32:47.560 --> 32:50.430
Yes, we just heard. We...

32:51.400 --> 32:52.080
I know.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.050
Squad room's empty.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.250
Is everybody hiding from me?

32:54.450 --> 32:56.720
Well, we thought about it.
You okay?

32:56.920 --> 32:58.060
Living a dream.

32:58.260 --> 32:59.920
Welcome to our nightmare.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.930
Torres and Knight are
currently trying to gather

33:02.130 --> 33:04.030
as much intel on Evelyn's
whereabouts as possible.

33:04.230 --> 33:05.610
VANCE:
Bad news from Interpol.

33:07.410 --> 33:08.600
John and Renée Watts

33:08.800 --> 33:10.700
allegedly fell off a balcony

33:10.900 --> 33:13.100
just hours
after landing in Moscow.

33:13.300 --> 33:14.340
What?

33:14.540 --> 33:15.740
Seems the Russians want
their spies back

33:15.940 --> 33:17.270
just to shut 'em up for good.

33:17.470 --> 33:19.940
About Yuri, we're guessing.
Whatever he was up to.

33:20.140 --> 33:21.410
Tell me that the
State Department

33:21.610 --> 33:23.950
is calling off their
precious deal.

33:24.150 --> 33:26.150
Oh, you would think so,
but what Russia does

33:26.350 --> 33:29.020
with its spies is of no concern
to Counselor Greco,

33:29.220 --> 33:31.020
long as the international
prisoners are released.

33:31.220 --> 33:32.690
Even if it gets Evelyn killed?

33:32.890 --> 33:34.790
Last we heard, they are
prepping her for transport.

33:34.990 --> 33:36.330
From where, exactly,

33:36.530 --> 33:38.000
is anyone's guess.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.130
So, if she gets to Russia,
only to meet

33:39.330 --> 33:40.830
the same fate as
these three...

33:41.030 --> 33:46.390
Whatever she knows about Yuri
and his mission dies with her.

33:56.130 --> 33:58.650
Yeah, whatever you can find out,
Tommy, I appreciate it.

33:58.850 --> 34:00.430
Okay, please call me back
if you hear anything.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.720
Anything?
Nothing.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.560
Yeah. Most of our usual sources

34:04.760 --> 34:06.390
haven't even heard
of a Russian deal.

34:06.590 --> 34:07.890
Yeah, same here.

34:08.090 --> 34:09.690
Even my friends at the State
Department are in the dark.

34:09.890 --> 34:12.080
Enough with the bad news
already!

34:13.810 --> 34:15.970
We're trying to find some good
news, Agent Parker, believe me.

34:16.170 --> 34:18.790
PARKER:
Then come back when you
have some, all right?

34:19.990 --> 34:20.990
Wait.

34:22.260 --> 34:23.410
I have something to say.

34:23.610 --> 34:25.640
No. No need to say it,
Knight. Look.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.710
Jimmy, Kasie, I'm sorry.

34:27.910 --> 34:29.180
Oh, no, it-it's not that. Uh...

34:29.380 --> 34:31.010
No, no, no. But it is.
See, the last couple days

34:31.220 --> 34:33.150
have gotten to me, along
with the countless favors

34:33.350 --> 34:34.790
I just called in
that are gonna get us nowhere...

34:34.990 --> 34:37.450
Uh, yeah, I get that, uh,
but this is

34:37.650 --> 34:40.320
more of an announcement
for the room.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.390
(sighs):
Uh...

34:41.590 --> 34:42.530
So, I know this is, uh,

34:42.730 --> 34:43.990
hardly the time or place, uh,

34:44.200 --> 34:46.700
but now that I have
you all here... (chuckles)

34:46.900 --> 34:50.150
and you want
some good news, um...

34:54.190 --> 34:55.070
...here it is.

34:55.270 --> 34:57.190
Here what is?

34:58.230 --> 34:59.890
I love you, too, Jimmy.

35:11.370 --> 35:12.390
Hello?

35:12.590 --> 35:13.760
(clears throat)

35:13.960 --> 35:15.610
Now can we all get
back to work, please?

35:16.410 --> 35:17.390
That was awesome.

35:17.590 --> 35:18.400
What did I tell you, man?

35:18.600 --> 35:20.300
I needed that.

35:20.500 --> 35:21.830
<i>You</i> needed that?

35:22.030 --> 35:23.900
I got it. Evelyn's location.

35:24.100 --> 35:24.900
Where?

35:25.100 --> 35:26.240
In a State Department vehicle

35:26.440 --> 35:29.370
headed for the Russian embassy.

35:29.570 --> 35:31.930
Good game.
(chuckles)

35:37.660 --> 35:39.520
(tires screech)

35:39.720 --> 35:41.550
Mr. Greco. Counselor.

35:41.750 --> 35:43.620
Nope. Absolutely not.

35:43.820 --> 35:46.120
Hello, Tim.
You came to see me off?

35:46.320 --> 35:48.360
No, no, Evelyn,
you do not have to go.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.030
Uh, yes, she does. Agent?

35:50.230 --> 35:51.430
Okay, fellas, what's
your business?

35:51.630 --> 35:53.800
We're NCIS, Agent, okay?
All good.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.100
McGEE:
Knight, Torres,
we got her out back

35:55.300 --> 35:56.500
by the delivery entrance.

35:56.700 --> 35:58.200
TORRES: Roger that.
The delivery entrance?

35:58.400 --> 35:59.470
GRECO:
To avoid meddlers.

35:59.670 --> 36:01.570
PARKER:
Or more likely,

36:01.770 --> 36:03.870
to not be seen
before you disappear for good.

36:04.070 --> 36:06.380
From America, maybe, but...

36:06.580 --> 36:07.810
Russia's not so bad in spring.

36:08.010 --> 36:09.710
I could really use
a fresh start.

36:09.910 --> 36:11.620
Like the one
your fellow spies never got?

36:11.820 --> 36:13.750
You-- Do not listen to them.

36:13.950 --> 36:16.420
Billings
and the Watts couple, huh?

36:16.620 --> 36:17.620
Billings took himself out.

36:17.820 --> 36:20.210
The Watts story,
it's unconfirmed.

36:21.170 --> 36:22.260
Are you saying they're dead?

36:22.460 --> 36:24.090
Yes, and you will be, too,
if you go.

36:24.300 --> 36:26.700
Do not listen to them.
McGEE:
Evelyn.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.600
Delilah still says that you were

36:28.800 --> 36:31.240
the absolute smartest T.A.
she has ever had.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.940
Aww, Delilah, really?
Yes.

36:34.140 --> 36:35.810
And in spite of how things
ended up,

36:36.010 --> 36:37.340
she would not want anything bad
to happen to you,

36:37.540 --> 36:38.510
and neither would I.

36:38.710 --> 36:39.940
Convict or not, Evelyn,

36:40.140 --> 36:42.610
you still have the right
to turn down this deal.

36:42.810 --> 36:44.220
GRECO:
But not to deny
an American prisoner

36:44.420 --> 36:46.020
a chance to come home.

36:46.220 --> 36:48.720
Or you could save
countless lives by helping us.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.220
PARKER:
There'll be other offers

36:50.420 --> 36:51.990
that don't involve
you getting killed.

36:52.190 --> 36:55.860
No, Agent, there will not be
any other offers, okay?

36:56.060 --> 36:57.760
Come on, oh-- are you just
gonna stand there?

36:57.960 --> 37:00.500
I got a daughter
about this one's age,

37:00.700 --> 37:02.070
so I'd like to hear more.

37:02.270 --> 37:03.600
My man.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.140
(scoffs)
Unbelievable.

37:06.340 --> 37:07.840
Evelyn, why don't you
just come back

37:08.040 --> 37:10.360
to NCIS with us,
and we'll talk about it.

37:11.390 --> 37:13.360
What do you say?

37:15.030 --> 37:17.360
Aww, Yuri.
(laughs softly)

37:18.670 --> 37:20.050
You know him.

37:20.250 --> 37:21.750
Of course I do.

37:21.950 --> 37:23.150
Ooh, is this a mug shot?

37:23.350 --> 37:25.840
That's too bad.
He was such a sweetheart.

37:27.010 --> 37:29.690
That is not a description
that we have heard before.

37:29.890 --> 37:31.900
Uh, okay, don't get me wrong.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.430
He was trouble.
(laughs)

37:33.630 --> 37:35.270
But, I mean, not at first.

37:35.470 --> 37:36.870
Yuri is who recruited me.

37:37.070 --> 37:39.800
Got me into ecology and stuff
coming out of undergrad.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.970
So, when did you get the sense
that he was trouble?

37:43.170 --> 37:44.540
Once he started pushing me

37:44.740 --> 37:46.510
to get him
that universal access key.

37:46.710 --> 37:48.550
Yuri was behind that?

37:48.750 --> 37:49.950
All of it.

37:50.150 --> 37:51.950
Though once he knew
I wasn't getting the key,

37:52.150 --> 37:54.690
he pretty much ghosted me.

37:54.890 --> 37:56.250
(scoffs)
Such a dude move.

37:56.450 --> 37:58.620
That key could have been used
to access bank codes,

37:58.820 --> 38:01.220
oil reserves, launch nukes.

38:01.430 --> 38:03.790
So when you say Yuri
was behind all of it...

38:03.990 --> 38:06.330
Global chaos. You know.

38:06.530 --> 38:09.100
Revenge, destruction.

38:09.300 --> 38:12.150
That was pretty much
all Yuri talked about.

38:12.950 --> 38:14.920
Okay. What's next?

38:15.990 --> 38:17.270
And what kind of global chaos

38:17.470 --> 38:19.610
was Yuri planning
when we caught him?

38:19.810 --> 38:21.280
Got to be some way to find out.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.650
Yeah, but I'm just not
so sure that it's Evelyn.

38:23.850 --> 38:25.430
(knocking on door)

38:27.200 --> 38:29.650
A private word with you,
Agent Parker? Outside?

38:29.850 --> 38:31.890
Outside? Are we gonna fight?

38:32.090 --> 38:33.860
I volunteer if you'd rather not.

38:34.060 --> 38:37.140
Nobody's gonna fight.
Just a question.

38:38.010 --> 38:39.750
Next time, I promise.

38:40.850 --> 38:41.870
(door closes)

38:42.070 --> 38:43.270
All right, Parker, who was it?

38:43.470 --> 38:44.440
Hey, back off.

38:44.640 --> 38:45.700
Who told you when and where

38:45.900 --> 38:47.040
we were transporting
our prisoner?

38:47.240 --> 38:48.940
I don't divulge my sources.

38:49.140 --> 38:50.510
Well, then, I hope you're happy.

38:50.710 --> 38:53.140
The Russians have gone silent
since you killed my deal.

38:53.340 --> 38:55.410
For all we know, they're gonna
kill the American prisoner

38:55.610 --> 38:56.510
if they haven't already.

38:56.710 --> 38:58.130
He's already dead.

38:59.930 --> 39:01.250
Senator Miller?

39:01.450 --> 39:02.990
As a member of the Foreign
Relations Committee,

39:03.190 --> 39:05.120
my sources say
the American prisoner

39:05.320 --> 39:07.560
died of natural causes
three weeks ago.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.960
Are you saying the Russians
were bluffing the whole time?

39:11.160 --> 39:12.900
Sure sounds like it.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.030
Well, I-- now, I still
need to verify that,

39:15.230 --> 39:16.400
but that still doesn't answer

39:16.600 --> 39:17.800
my question, Parker.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.240
Who told you?

39:19.440 --> 39:22.840
Are you really that dim?
I told him.

39:23.040 --> 39:24.740
And if you've got
a problem with that,

39:24.940 --> 39:26.340
you can take it up with my boss.

39:26.540 --> 39:28.180
VANCE:
And on your way
out, Mr. Greco,

39:28.380 --> 39:29.480
the FBI's in the lobby
with some questions

39:29.680 --> 39:30.710
about your finances.

39:30.910 --> 39:32.220
My finances?

39:32.420 --> 39:35.350
Yes, some, uh, portfolio
with the Central Bank of Russia?

39:35.550 --> 39:37.350
They-- Well, they can
better explain it.

39:37.550 --> 39:38.620
Right this way. Come on.

39:38.820 --> 39:40.160
W-Wait a minute.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.560
H-Hold on,
you checked my portfolio?

39:42.760 --> 39:44.330
They-they looked at my finances?

39:44.530 --> 39:46.700
Well, that explains a lot.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.970
I never did like that guy.

39:49.170 --> 39:51.900
You're just the gift
that keeps on giving today.

39:52.100 --> 39:54.910
Well, we are still
on the same side here.

39:55.110 --> 39:57.310
Thank you. No, really.

39:57.510 --> 40:00.980
And, uh, if I can
make it up to you...?

40:01.180 --> 40:04.420
Oh, no, Alden. We're done.

40:04.620 --> 40:06.330
Right.

40:08.100 --> 40:10.450
(scoffs)
Wait, you sure?

40:10.650 --> 40:12.290
Quite sure.

40:12.490 --> 40:16.140
Besides, you're still in love
with your old girlfriend.

40:27.450 --> 40:28.970
(scoffs)

40:29.170 --> 40:30.670
Women know things, you know?

40:30.870 --> 40:32.710
Thank you.

40:32.910 --> 40:34.080
Parker,

40:34.280 --> 40:35.180
Torres.

40:35.380 --> 40:37.200
Come with me.

40:39.770 --> 40:43.150
Thanks for getting back to me
on such short notice.

40:43.350 --> 40:45.120
What do you have for us, Doctor?

40:45.320 --> 40:49.190
I understand you have
Yuri Valkov in custody.

40:49.390 --> 40:50.830
We have. He's currently
in county jail,

40:51.030 --> 40:52.000
awaiting arraignment.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.630
And his mental state?

40:54.830 --> 40:56.370
Funny you should ask, Ducky.

40:56.570 --> 40:57.700
Yuri seems far too content

40:57.900 --> 40:59.800
for someone about
to spend life in prison.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.240
Oh, that's what I would
expect from him

41:02.440 --> 41:04.780
now that he's accomplished
his mission.

41:04.980 --> 41:06.440
You know his mission?

41:06.640 --> 41:11.080
I learned from a Russian contact
that before Sokolov defected,

41:11.280 --> 41:13.550
the Soviets had him
working on a project

41:13.750 --> 41:16.650
that was most troubling.

41:16.850 --> 41:18.720
And what's the project?

41:18.920 --> 41:21.590
Something that falls
into the category

41:21.790 --> 41:24.830
of weapons of mass destruction.

41:25.030 --> 41:26.230
That's troubling.

41:26.430 --> 41:28.400
Any idea what kind
of weapon, Duck?

41:28.600 --> 41:30.300
I'm still working on it,

41:30.500 --> 41:33.170
but the mere knowledge
of its existence

41:33.370 --> 41:36.110
conjures up
a frightening scenario.

41:36.310 --> 41:39.810
Sokolov's doomsday device
had to be what Yuri was after.

41:40.010 --> 41:41.780
What, even after 30-some years?

41:41.980 --> 41:43.710
Well, technology's
more advanced now.

41:43.910 --> 41:45.580
Whatever Sokolov
was working on then,

41:45.780 --> 41:47.280
it'd just be more feasible now.

41:47.480 --> 41:51.150
So if Yuri maybe managed
to torture any details

41:51.350 --> 41:52.660
about the device
out of Sokolov...

41:52.860 --> 41:54.260
And already sent it to Russia...

41:54.460 --> 41:55.790
Well, they could
already be building

41:55.990 --> 41:58.700
a prototype to use against us.

41:58.900 --> 42:00.330
That's a lot
of coulds and maybes.

42:00.530 --> 42:04.600
Yeah, the only person who knows
for sure right now: Yuri.

42:04.800 --> 42:07.270
Well, surely, you can
make some kind of a deal.

42:07.470 --> 42:09.310
We tried, Ducky,
he's not biting.

42:09.510 --> 42:12.310
More than content
to go to prison, like I said.

42:12.510 --> 42:14.210
And take whatever
he knows with him.

42:14.410 --> 42:17.060
Leaving us with no way
to get it.
