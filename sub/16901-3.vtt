WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:06.670
One day, sir,
this whole city will be yours.

00:07.273 --> 00:09.241
Oh, hey, can I talk to you?

00:10.043 --> 00:11.533
You always ruin everything.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.474
I have to apologize for him.

00:16.616 --> 00:17.583
He's been a bit tense

00:17.717 --> 00:19.844
since we found that I'm up
for the GE chairmanship.

00:19.986 --> 00:21.317
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

00:21.454 --> 00:23.445
I got a call
from some lawyer today

00:23.590 --> 00:25.820
who was asking me
what kind of boss you are

00:25.959 --> 00:26.983
and how long I've known you

00:27.127 --> 00:29.925
and what animal
best describes you.

00:30.063 --> 00:31.257
What did you say?

00:31.398 --> 00:34.196
An eagle
with the head of a bear.

00:34.334 --> 00:36.996
Thank you. Your respect
means the world to me, Lemon.

00:37.137 --> 00:39.105
I can't believe
it's starting already.

00:39.239 --> 00:40.103
What is?

00:40.240 --> 00:41.707
GE is vetting me.

00:41.841 --> 00:44.241
They're trying to see if I have
any skeletons in my closet.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.140
It's what they do with
all the presidential candidates.

00:46.279 --> 00:47.974
Do you think
they'll find anything?

00:48.114 --> 00:49.638
Oh, yeah.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.645
I've done some things, Lemon.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.084
That's why I hired
a private investigator

00:55.221 --> 00:57.018
to look
into my own background.

00:57.157 --> 00:59.557
He'll spot any red flags
before GE does,

00:59.692 --> 01:01.159
and that way I should be able
to stay ahead of this.

01:01.294 --> 01:04.751
Wait. You hired someone
to investigate yourself.

01:04.897 --> 01:05.796
That's weird.

01:05.932 --> 01:06.921
Well, you do the same thing

01:07.067 --> 01:08.728
with your therapist every week,
don't you?

01:08.868 --> 01:11.769
I had an amazing breakthrough
with my therapist this week.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.236
I was talking about...
Ring, ring!

01:13.373 --> 01:14.670
...that dream that I have
all the time...

01:14.808 --> 01:16.366
Hello.

01:16.509 --> 01:17.874
I'm sorry.
I have to take this.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.000
Yes.

01:19.145 --> 01:21.136
Well, she's right here.
Fake phone.

01:21.281 --> 01:22.646
She'll be right down.

01:22.782 --> 01:24.215
What else is going on?

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.307 --> 01:49.775
What's going on in here?
You're on time for work.

01:49.909 --> 01:52.776
The woman in your dressing room
is your wife.

01:52.912 --> 01:53.742
Sorry, Angie.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.871
I let Tracy back in my life
on two conditions.

01:56.015 --> 01:57.312
One... this.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.611
Bling-bling,
That is ghetto fabulous!

01:59.752 --> 02:01.242
This belonged
to Brooke Astor.

02:01.387 --> 02:02.115
It's very nice.

02:02.255 --> 02:04.689
And the other condition...
I'm with him all the time.

02:04.824 --> 02:09.021
All he gets to do is work, eat,
love on me, and sleep.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.424
Isn't that right, baby?

02:10.562 --> 02:11.587
I'm whipped!

02:11.731 --> 02:13.892
Angie got me up
at 7:30 today.

02:14.033 --> 02:16.729
Did you know in the morning
they have food, TV,

02:16.870 --> 02:17.768
almost everything?

02:17.904 --> 02:19.428
It's pretty good.
I did know that.

02:19.572 --> 02:20.470
Yeah.

02:20.607 --> 02:23.735
Liz, I need your help.
I can't do this alone.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.708
Tracy's like a horny child.

02:25.845 --> 02:27.904
He needs
constant adult supervision.

02:28.047 --> 02:29.480
Will you help me out
when I'm not here?

02:29.616 --> 02:31.607
If it keeps him like this,
yes.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.742
Will you be able to do that
without falling in love?

02:33.887 --> 02:35.081
Also yes.

02:35.221 --> 02:36.813
I think
this is gonna be great, Angie.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.254
I think you and me
are gonna make a great team.

02:39.392 --> 02:41.257
Oh, you looking
for a sassy black friend?

02:41.394 --> 02:43.419
Oh, no, I didn't... Well,
you got one now, girlfriend.

02:43.563 --> 02:44.621
Go on!

02:47.567 --> 02:49.899
Miss Maroney,
here's today's fan mail.

02:50.036 --> 02:51.333
Are there any from prisons?

02:51.471 --> 02:52.460
Are there?

02:52.605 --> 02:53.799
Federal!

02:54.807 --> 02:55.671
God!

02:55.808 --> 02:56.900
Putting on this weight

02:57.043 --> 02:58.943
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

02:59.078 --> 03:00.477
People actually like me now.

03:00.613 --> 03:03.309
There she is.
There's my star.

03:03.449 --> 03:05.349
And to think I wanted you
to lose this weight.

03:05.485 --> 03:06.509
It sounds so crazy now.

03:06.653 --> 03:07.915
I know.

03:08.054 --> 03:10.352
Oh, and I saw your Enorme
commercial. It's fabulous.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.650
What's Enorme?

03:11.791 --> 03:14.055
It's the number-one fragrance
for plus-sized women.

03:14.894 --> 03:18.762
Grassisima?

03:18.898 --> 03:20.661
Balena?

03:20.800 --> 03:22.563
Enorme.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.761
Make him chase the chunk.

03:24.904 --> 03:27.464
Available exclusively
at your local drug store.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.074
Do not use if menstruating.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.302
Can't plus-sized women
wear regular perfume?

03:31.444 --> 03:33.810
Jenna, your career
is really taking off now.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.381
And on a personal level, I just
like you more when you're fat.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.347
Oh, thank you.

03:38.484 --> 03:39.849
It's all happening!

03:39.986 --> 03:42.011
Okay,
let's shoot these promos.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.715
Can I get some makeup
for Tracy, please?

03:44.857 --> 03:46.825
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you?

03:46.960 --> 03:47.892
Hey.

03:48.027 --> 03:49.858
Oh, hell, no!

03:49.996 --> 03:52.157
Actually, he looks great.
Thank you.

03:59.272 --> 04:00.500
You Lenny Wosniak?

04:00.640 --> 04:01.698
Thanks for meeting me here.

04:01.841 --> 04:03.240
Yeah, I get it.

04:03.376 --> 04:04.274
Discretion.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.243
I wouldn't want to talk
about this in my office anyway.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.438
Yeah.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.947
Also, my gym
is right over there.

04:11.818 --> 04:15.185
So, uh...
how does this work?

04:15.321 --> 04:16.913
It's pretty simple, really.

04:17.055 --> 04:19.456
I'm gonna go through your life
with a fine-tooth comb.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.425
The more information I have,
the easier this is gonna be.

04:22.562 --> 04:24.052
Now, have you ever
been arrested?

04:24.197 --> 04:26.392
I have.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.625
The 1976 Democratic
National Convention.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.963
But it's okay.
I was there beating up hippies.

04:32.672 --> 04:34.333
And what about your family?
Any skeletons there?

04:34.474 --> 04:36.305
My brother Eddie sells
faulty sprinkler systems

04:36.442 --> 04:37.670
to elementary schools.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.778
My cousin Tim
fixes NBA games.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.346
My mother
is an Olympic-level racist.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.882
But as for the rest, they're too
drunk to do much of anything.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.418
Unless getting thrown out
of a Chili's is a crime.

04:47.553 --> 04:50.420
Any weird sex stuff
I should know about?

04:50.556 --> 04:51.682
You know what?
Don't tell me.

04:51.824 --> 04:53.689
I like to find that out
on my own.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.589
I'm a watcher.

04:55.728 --> 04:58.663
Okay, I'll get started on my end
of the process.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.595
Is there anything else
you want to tell me now?

05:00.733 --> 05:01.825
Nope.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.595
That's pretty much it.

05:05.405 --> 05:06.963
That's what they all say,
Mr. Donaghy.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.234
I'll be in touch.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.242
Mm, one more thing.

05:13.379 --> 05:16.610
If I sign a friend up at my gym,
I get a free hat, so...

05:18.084 --> 05:19.813
Think about it.

05:28.928 --> 05:29.986
I'm losing weight.

05:30.129 --> 05:32.097
What?
Look at my belt.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.597
This is the notch
I had to make last week.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.531
This is the notch
I'm using now.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.569
I'm back to
the factory-made notches.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.036
Jenna, calm down.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.165
No, I won't calm down.
This can't be happening.

05:43.309 --> 05:44.833
Everything is based
on the fat.

05:44.977 --> 05:47.969
Enorme,
the offer to play Ms. PAC-MAN

05:48.114 --> 05:49.581
in the live-action
Atari movie!

05:49.716 --> 05:50.307
What?

05:50.450 --> 05:53.476
And worst of all,
Jack won't like me anymore.

05:53.619 --> 05:56.452
We have a secret ritual now
where we slap our palms together

05:56.589 --> 05:57.920
when we walk by each other.

05:58.057 --> 05:58.955
A high five.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.652
It was our special thing.

06:03.863 --> 06:04.761
Hey, Liz Lemon.

06:04.897 --> 06:06.057
I've been reading
the newspaper

06:06.199 --> 06:08.633
to come up with some ideas
for some topical sketches.

06:08.768 --> 06:11.100
So, this week,
can we do "Business Section"?

06:11.237 --> 06:13.535
Tracy, I love it
that you're trying to help.

06:13.673 --> 06:14.662
Everything is great!

06:14.807 --> 06:16.104
Thanks to Angie.

06:16.242 --> 06:18.301
Word.
Where is my lovely wife?

06:18.444 --> 06:20.105
She had to step out.
She had a hair appointment.

06:20.246 --> 06:22.305
I'm going
to a strip club now.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.609
What? No.
I can't let you do that.

06:24.751 --> 06:27.515
I'm sorry, Liz.
This is who I am.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.780
You can't ask a bird
not to fly.

06:29.922 --> 06:32.447
You can't ask a fish
not to swim,

06:32.592 --> 06:33.559
You can't ask a tiger

06:33.693 --> 06:36.184
not to turn back
into a Chinese dude at midnight.

06:38.164 --> 06:39.791
Angie is gonna kill us.

06:39.932 --> 06:42.662
I feel bad about
doing this to you, Liz Lemon.

06:42.802 --> 06:43.666
I really do.

06:43.803 --> 06:45.828
And the only way
I can feel better about myself

06:45.972 --> 06:49.100
is to get booby-slapped
by a coked-out Russian stripper.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.771
I'm out.

06:52.512 --> 06:53.410
Ugh!

06:55.148 --> 06:56.740
Is there something
we need to discuss?

06:56.883 --> 06:59.010
No, Jack.
Everything's great.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.483
Look...

07:00.620 --> 07:01.587
it's come to my attention

07:01.721 --> 07:03.154
that you no longer
have an eating problem.

07:03.289 --> 07:05.223
That's ridiculous.
Is it?

07:05.358 --> 07:07.553
You're not breathing heavily,
your skin is cleared up.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.684
I even find you
slightly attractive right now.

07:09.829 --> 07:12.093
Don't say that, Jack.

07:12.231 --> 07:15.166
Come on.
"Me want food," right?

07:15.301 --> 07:17.030
Do you want food, Jenna?

07:17.170 --> 07:18.034
Do you?

07:18.171 --> 07:20.036
I don't know anymore.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.198
I have no appetite.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.036
It's okay.
Kenneth.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.737
Kenneth here is gonna be
with you 24-7 to keep you fat.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.039
Keep Jenna fat.
Keep Jenna funny.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.011
Right, Kenneth?

07:29.148 --> 07:30.979
Lt'll be just like back home
on the pig farm.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.812
I'll fatten you up,
grow to love you,

07:32.952 --> 07:34.920
and then my uncles
will slit your throat.

07:39.258 --> 07:40.748
What have you got
for me, Len?

07:40.893 --> 07:42.724
Well, Mr. Donaghy,
you're pretty clean.

07:42.862 --> 07:46.025
And your sex life
checks out real nice.

07:46.165 --> 07:47.063
Thank you.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.394
There are a couple things,
though,

07:48.534 --> 07:50.661
that could get in the way
of this promotion.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.395
Like you should probably
give up your membership

07:52.538 --> 07:54.267
to the all-white
Woodvale Country Club.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.136
That is not
an all-white club.

07:56.275 --> 07:57.765
What about Johnny Carlos?
He's ethnic.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.901
He's the king of Spain, Jack.
I don't think that counts.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.241
All right.
I'll resign.

08:02.381 --> 08:05.043
Okay, you also have an
undocumented domestic employee.

08:05.184 --> 08:07.652
Manuelo?
No, I need Manuelo.

08:07.787 --> 08:09.948
I could never pay an
English-speaking person that little.

08:10.089 --> 08:12.114
They'd starve.

08:12.258 --> 08:13.725
All right,
I'll send him home.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.225
Well, that's it.

08:15.361 --> 08:17.261
Unless you think
I missed something.

08:17.396 --> 08:19.591
No, I think
you've been very thorough.

08:19.732 --> 08:21.666
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.102
Oh, Jack.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.569
One last thing.

08:27.707 --> 08:28.731
You don't have

08:28.875 --> 08:31.503
a massive collection
of cookie jars, do you?

08:36.849 --> 08:38.111
How did you find out
about that?

08:40.052 --> 08:42.111
Collector of the Year.

08:42.255 --> 08:45.452
Congratulations,
Victor Nightingale.

08:45.591 --> 08:48.151
Thank you.
Yes, I'm Victor Nightingale.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.124
This is bad.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.858
CEOs don't have
thousands of cookie jars.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.558
Weird little guys
in bow ties do.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.760
You hear what I'm getting at? What?

08:57.904 --> 08:59.030
You saying it's a gay thing?

08:59.171 --> 09:01.139
You wish it was a gay thing.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.798
This is worse.
You got to get rid of them.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.341
No.
I'm not doing that.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.536
I've already made enough
sacrifices for this company.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.044
They're not gonna get this.

09:11.984 --> 09:14.043
This is Rudolph Giuliani
in 1987

09:14.186 --> 09:16.916
with his collection
of antique wooden dolls.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.546
That's a fake.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.522
Giuliani
doesn't collect dolls.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.957
Yeah, you're right.
He doesn't.

09:22.094 --> 09:23.425
Because he incinerated them

09:23.563 --> 09:25.690
in 1989,
the year he ran for mayor.

09:25.831 --> 09:27.458
He looks so happy.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.693
Aw, Jack,
the choice is yours.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.703
You can either be the head

09:33.839 --> 09:35.704
of the largest corporation
in America

09:35.841 --> 09:40.369
or get buried in a bow tie
with a bunch of cookie jars.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.413
Liz Lemon,
where's Tracy?

09:48.554 --> 09:50.613
He, uh, went to the vet.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.018
His cobra got sick.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.386
Okay.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.322
Hey, everybody.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.894
I'm back from doing
whatever Liz Lemon said.

09:57.029 --> 10:00.021
And what was that, exactly?

10:00.166 --> 10:01.724
My cobra, Ramses.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.461
He got sick.
So I took him to the vet.

10:05.571 --> 10:07.436
Then my thumb got caught
in my butt

10:07.573 --> 10:09.268
so I nodded my head
until it came out.

10:11.410 --> 10:12.468
Come here, you.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.074
You smell like Enorme
and brass polish.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.342
You were at a strip club.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.918
It was all Liz Lemon's fault.
The whole plan was hers.

10:21.053 --> 10:22.281
Aw, come on, man!

10:22.421 --> 10:25.584
Tracy Jordan,
you are in for a world of hurt.

10:25.725 --> 10:27.090
But you're worse.

10:27.226 --> 10:28.625
I trusted you.

10:28.761 --> 10:29.887
You wear glasses.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.691
Your access to Tracy Jordan
is cut off.

10:32.832 --> 10:35.426
You can't cut me off.
This is my show.

10:35.568 --> 10:36.466
Not anymore.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.536
Everything
goes through me now.

10:38.671 --> 10:40.571
Goodbye forever,
Liz Lemon.

10:40.706 --> 10:43.038
Thank you for being
my secretary!

10:45.144 --> 10:48.511
Normally, I would tell Tracy
our sketch ideas.

10:50.549 --> 10:52.312
Okay.

10:52.451 --> 10:55.318
In the opening sketch this week,
Tracy is a bank robber...

10:55.454 --> 10:56.318
No.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.923
I don't want to perpetuate
any black stereotypes.

10:59.058 --> 10:59.922
Next.

11:00.059 --> 11:03.085
Okay, well, in this one,

11:03.229 --> 11:08.496
Tracy plays a gentleman
who wears flamboyant clothes

11:08.634 --> 11:10.795
and lives uptown.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.767
He's a pimp.
He's an entrepreneur.

11:12.905 --> 11:13.997
What's the character's name?

11:14.140 --> 11:15.835
Slickback Lamar.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.043
He's also playing
Barack Obama.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.271
No.
We support Kucinich.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.574
Listen, Angie,

11:22.715 --> 11:25.309
I'm sorry I lied, but you
got to give me another chance.

11:25.451 --> 11:26.509
Excuse me.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.753
Did you just try to control
my body with your white hand?

11:31.023 --> 11:33.355
Don't make me contact
Reverend Sharpton.

11:33.492 --> 11:34.516
I can't deal with you.

11:34.660 --> 11:38.027
I want new writers for Tracy,
or he doesn't do the show.

11:38.164 --> 11:41.156
Grizz, Dot Com,
start coming up with ideas.

11:43.502 --> 11:47.165
We open on a lone soldier
walking through the desert.

11:47.306 --> 11:49.171
The year... 1861.

11:49.308 --> 11:50.502
The place?

11:50.643 --> 11:51.871
Mars.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.537
This stuff will make you
real fat, Miss Maroney.

11:55.681 --> 11:58.616
It made my Dad's heart
just up and give out.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.686
And that's what made
my Mom's friend Ron move in.

12:02.988 --> 12:04.080
Mmm.

12:05.257 --> 12:06.155
Mm-hmm!

12:06.292 --> 12:08.624
Coming in for a landing.

12:10.196 --> 12:11.424
Uh-oh.
There's turbulence.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.897
And now an Indian guy
got up to use the bathroom,

12:15.034 --> 12:16.160
and an air marshal shot him.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.234
Arrrrhh!

12:17.369 --> 12:19.860
No. No, I can't.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.631
Boy, I wish I had
some pig sedative right now.

12:25.044 --> 12:26.773
Goodbye, cookie jars.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.880
Thank you
for taking care of this for me.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.504
No problem, Mr. Donaghy.

12:30.649 --> 12:33.482
This is for the best.

12:33.619 --> 12:36.816
No more secrets.
Nothing standing in my way now.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.218
But just out of curiosity,

12:38.357 --> 12:40.689
what exactly are you going to do
with all of these?

12:40.826 --> 12:42.953
They'll be taken to Jersey City
and incinerated.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.029
No.
No, no, no, no.

12:45.164 --> 12:46.461
I can't have that.
Give that to me.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.725
It's your funeral, Donaghy.

12:47.867 --> 12:48.993
I can't destroy them.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.626
I'll give them to someone.
A fellow ceramiphile.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.205
You're like John Kerry
with his windsurfing.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.331
I warned him, too.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.604
How'd it go with Angie?

13:02.748 --> 13:05.148
Terrible. She hates me.
She's hijacking the show.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.182
I got to talk to Jack.

13:06.318 --> 13:08.081
You want a scary black lady
to be nice to you,

13:08.220 --> 13:09.778
tell her you like her nails.

13:09.922 --> 13:11.549
Always works for me
at the bank.

13:13.025 --> 13:14.424
Miss Lemon,
may I speak with you?

13:14.560 --> 13:16.221
Sure.
Can you walk and talk?

13:16.362 --> 13:19.798
Usually, but now you got me
thinking about it.

13:19.932 --> 13:23.663
Jenna with problem I have.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.770
There it is.

13:24.904 --> 13:26.929
I'm supposed to be helping
Miss Maroney stay fat,

13:27.072 --> 13:28.130
but it's not working.

13:28.274 --> 13:29.366
How do I get her to eat?

13:29.508 --> 13:30.736
Well, a lot of women overeat

13:30.876 --> 13:32.468
because they feel bad
about themselves.

13:32.611 --> 13:34.169
Maybe that's the problem.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.679
Everything's going so well
for Miss Maroney right now.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.408
Yeah, so be mean to her.

13:38.551 --> 13:42.487
Women with low self-esteem take
refuge in either food or sex.

13:42.621 --> 13:44.020
Not me, of course.

13:47.059 --> 13:49.994
Hi. I just wanted to meet you,
Mr. Mason. I'm a really big fan.

13:50.129 --> 13:52.154
Who picked out your outfit?
Stevie Wonder?

13:54.133 --> 13:55.498
Hey! Hey! Hey!

13:55.634 --> 13:56.999
Nice man!

13:58.804 --> 14:00.533
So you got to be mean,
Kenneth.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.368
I guess I could wait for her
to drop something

14:02.508 --> 14:05.068
and then say,
"Smooth move, ex-lax. "

14:05.211 --> 14:07.145
That's what
my mom's friend Ron would do.

14:07.279 --> 14:08.405
Oh, brother.

14:08.547 --> 14:10.174
All right,
Jenna really wants this, huh?

14:10.316 --> 14:12.307
Her career depends on it.
Please help.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.578
Okay, do you have something
to write on?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.521
Oh, I got one.

14:22.661 --> 14:26.119
Sir, someone else called about
purchasing your collection.

14:26.265 --> 14:27.857
A Mr. Gary Heingarten?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.195
No.
Jonathan, he lives in Albany.

14:30.336 --> 14:33.066
The temperature fluctuations
alone would...

14:33.205 --> 14:35.765
These things expand
and contract.

14:35.908 --> 14:37.739
They're alive, Jonathan.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.435
Hey, do you have a minute?

14:39.578 --> 14:41.239
Tracy's wife is...

14:41.380 --> 14:42.847
What's with the cookie jar?

14:42.982 --> 14:44.244
I collect them.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.977
Really? Is that some sort of
unresolved childhood thing?

14:47.119 --> 14:48.143
Nice try.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.255
We never had any cookie jars
in my home

14:50.389 --> 14:51.947
because our mother
never baked us any cookies

14:52.091 --> 14:53.888
'cause she never felt
we deserved any cookies.

14:54.026 --> 14:56.051
So, obviously, it has nothing
to do with my childhood.

14:56.195 --> 14:58.720
But that cookie jar
says "Mom" on it.

14:58.864 --> 15:00.195
Uh, I don't think so.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.425
I've always viewed it
as an upside-down "Wow. "

15:02.568 --> 15:05.401
But it doesn't matter now
because I have to, um...

15:06.839 --> 15:08.033
...get rid of them all.

15:08.173 --> 15:08.730
Why?

15:08.874 --> 15:10.432
Because the guy
with the weird hobby

15:10.576 --> 15:11.907
never gets
the corner office.

15:13.012 --> 15:15.606
Lemon, what is going on
on your stage right now?

15:18.217 --> 15:20.811
Oh. This is what I came
to talk to you about.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.614
Tracy's wife
is out of control.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.689
Did you tell her
you like her fingernails?

15:24.823 --> 15:25.755
No.

15:25.891 --> 15:29.088
But I thought that we could
give her a consultant credit.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.355
It's meaningless,
but it might calm her down.

15:31.497 --> 15:32.395
Lemon, I'm impressed.

15:32.531 --> 15:34.863
You're beginning to think like
a businessman. A businesswoman.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.194
I don't think that's a word.

15:36.335 --> 15:38.496
Unfortunately,
what you've gotten yourself into

15:38.637 --> 15:40.867
is not a business situation,
but a family conflict.

15:41.006 --> 15:41.904
So it's tricky.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.406
So what do I do
about Angie?

15:45.878 --> 15:47.402
I think you're
gonna have to fight her.

15:47.546 --> 15:48.774
What?
Yeah.

15:48.914 --> 15:51.883
You throw her out, she'll
probably punch you in the face.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.382
Then we eject her
from the building,

15:53.519 --> 15:54.417
and we bar her for life.

15:54.553 --> 15:55.815
I think Angie's right-handed,

15:55.955 --> 15:57.286
so you have to
work her clockwise.

15:57.423 --> 15:59.050
You've already
thought about fighting her?

15:59.191 --> 16:01.352
Every time I meet a person, I
figure how I'm gonna fight them.

16:01.493 --> 16:02.585
You have a gimpy left knee,
right?

16:02.728 --> 16:03.854
I'm not gonna fight anybody.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.896
I'm gonna give her the title,
and she'll back off.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.794
Lemon, you're gonna get hit
in the face,

16:07.933 --> 16:09.230
and it's gonna hurt
like hell.

16:09.368 --> 16:10.801
You want to lean in
to take away their momentum.

16:10.936 --> 16:11.868
Hands up.
Come on.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.437
I don't want to.
Lean in. Come on.

16:13.572 --> 16:14.630
Oh, God.
Stop it!

16:17.609 --> 16:19.270
Hello, Jenna.

16:19.411 --> 16:20.537
Still failing at overeating

16:20.679 --> 16:22.306
just like you fail
at everything in your life?

16:22.448 --> 16:23.676
What?
You quitter.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.909
You gonna quit this
like you quit fashion school?

16:26.051 --> 16:27.450
Give up like you gave up

16:27.586 --> 16:29.076
on your relationship
with David Blaine?

16:29.221 --> 16:30.711
He's the one
who drove the wedge...

16:30.856 --> 16:31.788
with his magic.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.119
Also, you've got
so many daddy issues,

16:34.259 --> 16:36.318
the only thing keeping you
from being a stripper

16:36.462 --> 16:37.759
is your weird mole.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.090
Kenneth.

16:39.231 --> 16:40.698
That's very hurtful.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.698
You lied about
your brother drowning

16:42.835 --> 16:45.303
so people would come
to your one-woman show.

16:45.437 --> 16:48.463
Kenneth, I've never heard you
talk this way.

16:48.607 --> 16:50.268
Your toes
look like dried-up shrimps.

16:50.409 --> 16:51.341
Oh.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.806
Oh, daddy.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.381
Go on.
Keep talking.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.416
What else
don't you like about me?

17:02.654 --> 17:03.951
Can I help you?

17:04.089 --> 17:05.454
Yes.

17:05.590 --> 17:08.458
Angie, I know you and I
got off on the wrong foot here,

17:08.594 --> 17:10.185
but I want you to know

17:10.329 --> 17:13.457
that I appreciate
your contribution to the show,

17:13.598 --> 17:18.194
and so I want to offer you
a consultant credit.

17:18.337 --> 17:19.667
I don't want
that crap title.

17:19.805 --> 17:21.932
You think you're gonna
buy me off so I'll play nice?

17:22.074 --> 17:23.734
It's never gonna happen.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.268
Okay.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.344
I'm ordering you to leave.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.005
Excuse me?

17:31.150 --> 17:34.085
Get your stuff and get out.
Don't make me say it again.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.777
No, Liz Lemon,
don't do it.

17:35.921 --> 17:37.582
Are you steppin' up on me?

17:37.723 --> 17:39.588
So what if I am?
Also, your nails look tacky.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.852
Oh, wait a minute!

17:41.994 --> 17:43.894
Enough, damn it!
Enough!

17:44.029 --> 17:46.589
Do I have to fix
this situation?

17:46.732 --> 17:48.222
I am the immature one.

17:48.367 --> 17:49.664
But the both of you,

17:49.802 --> 17:52.032
you're forcing me
to act like an adult.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.399
An adult!

17:53.539 --> 17:55.200
And even worse,

17:55.340 --> 17:58.434
you're making me stop two ladies
from going at it.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.738
But I don't care.

18:00.879 --> 18:02.506
'Cause I'm putting
my foot down.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.240
You're putting your foot down
with me?

18:04.383 --> 18:05.577
Uh-huh.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.344
Baby, you got to go.

18:07.486 --> 18:08.418
You're controlling,

18:08.554 --> 18:10.454
you're manipulative,
you're loud...

18:10.589 --> 18:13.387
Tracy, I've never heard you
talk like that before.

18:15.327 --> 18:16.988
Hey, let me
get this shirt off.

18:17.129 --> 18:18.096
Get it off.

18:19.665 --> 18:20.859
Okay, so,
just to be clear,

18:20.999 --> 18:23.467
does this mean
Angie is leaving or...

18:23.602 --> 18:26.400
<i>Oh, no!
You guys start with that?!</i>

18:26.538 --> 18:28.335
That... wow!

18:28.474 --> 18:29.634
That is...

18:34.913 --> 18:37.211
Mr. Donaghy?
I've got some bad news.

18:37.349 --> 18:38.976
I wasn't able to get
Miss Maroney to eat.

18:39.118 --> 18:39.982
I'm so sorry.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.143
What happened?

18:41.286 --> 18:43.652
Well, It turns out
she's the wrong kind of crazy,

18:43.789 --> 18:45.916
and I guess
we have to get married now.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.719
Apology accepted, Kenneth.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.658
I suppose we're both having
a pretty bad day.

18:50.796 --> 18:51.728
Ha!

18:51.864 --> 18:54.025
Look at that
kooky old cookie jar.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.461
I like the upside-down "Wow"
on it.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.632
You like cookie jars,
Kenneth?

19:03.775 --> 19:06.710
Well, I guess I've never
thought about it that much.

19:06.845 --> 19:09.143
We had a nice one
back home in Georgia.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.215
Had a bear on it.

19:11.350 --> 19:15.684
I remember when my Mom's friend
Ron would come over.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.915
They'd go into the bedroom
to sort out their paperwork,

19:19.057 --> 19:22.823
and I'd just go ahead
and stare at that cookie jar.

19:22.961 --> 19:27.625
It was almost as if I took
every problem that I ever had

19:27.766 --> 19:30.963
and I put it
inside that cookie jar.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.934
And I sealed it up so tight,

19:33.071 --> 19:37.337
that nothing would never,
ever, ever get out.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.171
So, I guess
to answer your question,

19:42.314 --> 19:44.145
I'd give cookie jars
about a "B."

19:45.284 --> 19:46.876
Some people
have so many problems

19:47.019 --> 19:49.078
that there aren't enough
cookie jars in the world

19:49.221 --> 19:50.153
to contain them.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.587
Well,
that just makes me sad.

19:54.259 --> 19:57.057
Kenneth, I have
a cookie-jar collection.

19:58.630 --> 19:59.688
Would you like to have it?

19:59.831 --> 20:01.731
Of course, sir!
I'd love to!

20:01.867 --> 20:05.064
Always hold them squarely
at the base, never by the lid.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.071
And should you ever go
to the convention in Sarasota,

20:08.207 --> 20:10.539
please tell Patty
and Beth and all of them

20:10.676 --> 20:13.509
that Vic Nightingale
says hello.

20:13.645 --> 20:15.078
Okay, sir.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.359
Are you happy now,
you son of a bitch?

20:33.699 --> 20:35.496
You son of a bitch.

20:37.636 --> 20:40.833
Grassisima?

20:40.973 --> 20:44.033
Balena?

20:44.176 --> 20:46.610
Grassota?

20:46.745 --> 20:49.714
Ooh?

20:49.848 --> 20:53.147
Enorme?

20:53.285 --> 20:56.277
Enorme?

20:56.421 --> 20:59.788
Como ti amo?

20:59.925 --> 21:03.554
Porcella?

21:04.305 --> 21:10.575
