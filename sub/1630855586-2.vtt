WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:09.760
Long ago, beings decided
that creatures could be friends.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.221
I want to befriend
this hard-footed run monster

00:12.304 --> 00:15.057
to borrow its speed
and brush its neck bangs.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.265
You should sit on it.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.476
But it might kick me.

00:17.559 --> 00:18.977
That is the price of speed.

00:20.812 --> 00:21.897
Okay. Easy.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.482
Easy now, new friend.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.360
Soon you will be
the default mode of transportation.

00:26.443 --> 00:29.530
-Some creatures were too mean.
-Greetings, large vibrating creature.

00:29.613 --> 00:30.948
Would you like to cohabitate?

00:31.448 --> 00:32.991
So we chose ones that were smaller.

00:33.075 --> 00:35.369
Greetings, tiny vibrating creature.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.246
Would you like to cohabitate?

00:38.539 --> 00:39.706
Much better.

00:39.790 --> 00:42.417
Other creatures were too spiky.
Like ouch orbs.

00:42.918 --> 00:44.127
Should have expected that.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.088
Or too stinky, like butt bombers.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.131
Oh, Lorb, it burns.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.758
But some were just right.

00:49.842 --> 00:52.052
Like vibrating creatures
and moral creatures

00:52.135 --> 00:54.513
and trash beards and even slow domes.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.808
Now, many beings say creatures
are our best friends.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.894
But do they really love us?
Or just our treats?

01:01.979 --> 01:04.230
You licked me inside the mouth.

01:04.730 --> 01:05.774
Gratitude.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.408
Here's our orb
It's slightly leaning

01:14.491 --> 01:16.201
Orbiting a star

01:16.952 --> 01:19.621
We find ways to give life meaning

01:19.705 --> 01:21.248
Some might seem bizarre

01:22.207 --> 01:24.459
All we know is that we exist

01:24.543 --> 01:27.421
And it won't be for long
So it helps to put some foot tubes on

01:27.504 --> 01:29.756
Joy and sadness, courage and fear

01:29.840 --> 01:32.426
Curiosity and anger
On a planet full of danger

01:32.509 --> 01:34.636
And it's only getting stranger
From here

01:43.437 --> 01:46.982
But do they really love us?
Or just our treats?

01:47.065 --> 01:48.984
Sometimes,
I think it'd be easier to be a creature.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.612
Not have to worry so much
about other beings liking me.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.489
I think, for some creatures,
that's all they worry about.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.074
Then there is no escape.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.576
Anyway, creatures terrify me.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.454
Well, they say, to grow, you need
to do the things that terrify you.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.997
Like watch my mouthstones fall out?

02:02.080 --> 02:04.541
Was thinking more like adopt a creature.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.586
No deception, I think a creature roommate
would do you good.

02:07.669 --> 02:08.669
Something to care for.

02:08.753 --> 02:12.299
I care for plants, and they don't bite.
Except for one.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.051
Something that knows you exist?

02:15.010 --> 02:16.803
I'd rather lose my mouthstones.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.764
And vibrating creatures make
my eyes swell.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.808
-With joy?
-With pain and crust.

02:21.892 --> 02:25.312
I'm worried about you.
Always so-- How do I put this kindly?

02:26.104 --> 02:28.732
Alone. A creature would love you.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.569
I want a being to love me. The real me.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.738
Not just some being who gives them treats.

02:35.239 --> 02:38.075
Infant strides, my sibling.
Infant strides.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.493
Greetings. Your usual.

02:39.576 --> 02:43.247
Gratitude. Soap leaf.
This shouldn't have--

02:50.838 --> 02:54.091
Oh, no. That's not right.
You always order the same sustenance.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.135
Swaddled mush, no soap leaf,
side of crying circles.

03:07.062 --> 03:07.896
You are correct.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.607
-You are correct in that matter.
-I'll get you a soapless rendition.

03:10.691 --> 03:14.152
While you wait, here.
I'm growing my own fuzz juice orb.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.989
They're extra fuzzy and juicy
during fuzz-juice-orb season.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.365
They are my favorite.

03:18.866 --> 03:22.703
Our lifegivers would cut them up
and let us dip them in melted cocoslab.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.581
I know it sounds like another one
of my strange combinations.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.667
No. Sounds lovely.
I'd like to try that sometime.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.879
Maybe tonight.
It's my first night off in forever.

03:34.673 --> 03:37.551
Congratulations?

03:40.804 --> 03:42.222
I'm a sky screamer!

03:43.056 --> 03:45.726
-Hey.
-Hear me scream at the sky!

03:46.977 --> 03:47.811
Hey.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.231
Hey, you bit me.

03:53.192 --> 03:56.862
My sweet legume, I have work.
Important work.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.155
Can we play later?

03:58.238 --> 04:01.491
If you won't let me be a creature,
then you gotta let me pick one.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.994
No, I don't. It's just you and me for now.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.164
Then when?
I'm already this many revolutions.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.250
-Soon.
-But you said that when I was this many.

04:10.334 --> 04:13.212
And you said that when I was this many

04:13.295 --> 04:14.796
and when I was this many.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.714
Well, I only remember blurry shapes
and sounds,

04:16.798 --> 04:18.425
but you probably said it then too.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.552
I can barely handle us alone right now.

04:20.636 --> 04:25.265
But one day, you won't pick a creature.
A creature will pick you.

04:26.642 --> 04:27.559
Promise?

04:27.643 --> 04:30.103
Does a two-wheeled foot pusher
go faster downhill?

04:30.771 --> 04:33.357
I think. But I'm six. You tell me.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.692
I just thought
of a fun thing for you to do.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.569
Go deep-sea diving?

04:37.653 --> 04:38.820
Even better.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.031
Take out the trash.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.783
Trash!

04:42.866 --> 04:46.912
Wow. You come here
every day and stare at that nice manager,

04:46.995 --> 04:50.415
and finally, they give you an opening
to ask them out, and you froze.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.709
Like your brain
after drinking something cold too fast.

04:52.793 --> 04:56.338
Oh, cruel Rorb.
I can barely think around them.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.882
They're the first being
who gives me internal flutters.

05:00.384 --> 05:03.846
So thoughtfulâ€¦ and so dedicated.

05:04.680 --> 05:09.351
And that art on their limbs, so symbolic.
Probably.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.563
Don't worry.
One day, a being will pick you. I promise.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.023
Or not. That would also be fine.

05:17.442 --> 05:21.238
Here we go. Swaddled mush, no soap leaf.
Apologies for the mix-up.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.825
No. No need for apologies.

05:24.908 --> 05:28.203
My apologies for your apologies.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.581
Enjoy your mush.

05:32.291 --> 05:36.336
Unfortunate news. Two waitbeings
and a chef called out sick tonight.

05:36.420 --> 05:39.298
They seem to be healing themselves
by listening to the same music.

05:39.882 --> 05:42.676
Is it possible they called out sick
to go to a concert?

05:42.759 --> 05:45.179
Don't know, but I'm gonna need you
to stay for the late shift.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.973
What? I've had this night off scheduled
for weeks.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.559
I can't remember
the last time I had one off.

05:50.642 --> 05:54.980
I know, and it's that experience
and devotion to this restaurant

05:55.063 --> 05:56.565
that we have come to rely on.

05:56.648 --> 05:59.818
And that big anniversary meal
for that couple who loves you.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.946
I also have a vibrating creature
with asthma,

06:03.030 --> 06:05.949
and I don't have my creature sitter
to give them their lung juice inhaler.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.451
I don't want to abandon the restaurant,

06:07.534 --> 06:09.328
but I am left without a choice.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.121
I can do it.

06:11.747 --> 06:15.626
I realize I wasn't in that conversation,
but I heard you need assistance.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.254
I use a being inhaler. I can do it.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.549
There we go. Terrific. It's settled.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.259
No, you cannot do this.

06:24.343 --> 06:27.930
Gratitude, but you do not need
to look after my vibrating creature.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.556
Good, because you're allergic.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.641
Like this, right?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.851
You are also completely terrified.

06:32.935 --> 06:35.938
Well, yes, works the same way.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.398
Look at that. An expert in lung juice.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.859
Seems like we've solved two problems
in record time.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.237
You don't even know
where my apartment is located.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.821
They'll find it.

06:46.698 --> 06:47.783
Are you sure?

06:47.866 --> 06:51.370
Oh, yeah. Lorb knows I've never met
a creature I don't love.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.038
I'm a total creature being.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.122
You can trust--

07:19.189 --> 07:21.149
Are you picking me?

07:35.747 --> 07:37.708
This must be the Manager's place.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.715
I can do it. Wait, how do I do it again?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.884
And you apply it gently to their face,

07:46.967 --> 07:50.762
give it two poofs and ding ding.
That's how you apply a creature inhaler.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.682
Thanks for gazing. Don't forget
to smash that validation button.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.809
And now, a word about mouthstone goo.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.769
Mouthstone goo.

07:57.853 --> 08:00.939
It's sweet, it's minty,
and it's meant to taste like food.

08:01.023 --> 08:04.151
But don't eat it. Unless you do,
which is fine. I think.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.569
Is it fine? How much did you eat?

08:07.571 --> 08:08.864
-Hey.
-How's it going?

08:11.450 --> 08:14.661
Wow, their place is so meticulous.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.163
Okay. All ready.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.249
Got my mild poison and cocoslab
to give them when they get home.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.920
Now you just need to keep
an asthmatic creature alive until they do.

08:23.003 --> 08:23.921
Don't remind me.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.090
Or actually do.
Yeah, remind me frequently.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.051
Greetings, vibrating creature.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.302
Look at us.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.554
The air is gently toxic to you

08:32.638 --> 08:34.556
and you are gently toxic to me,

08:34.640 --> 08:36.558
but we could still be friends.

08:39.770 --> 08:43.232
Low on dough slices, low on wheat elbows,
and these are overripe.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.733
They were underripe yesterday.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.694
They have a 20-minute window
between being a rock and an evil mush.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.864
Table two has a goober-pod allergy.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.908
Table seven wants zingy yellow goo.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.995
And that being sent
that being a mild poison.

08:59.081 --> 09:00.999
I'm gonna see how this plays out.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.086
And a one, and a twoâ€¦

09:04.586 --> 09:06.588
Revolutions are greatâ€¦

09:06.672 --> 09:09.591
My friends, fizzy festivity poison on us

09:09.675 --> 09:12.594
to celebrate your 50 revolutions
of companionship.

09:12.678 --> 09:15.973
-Oh, my, my. What a surprise.
-That is far too kind.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.892
-But yes, we did expect that.
-Well, enjoy.

09:18.976 --> 09:21.019
It's important you feel like
you're family here.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.146
Every being deserves that.
Now, I have to--

09:23.230 --> 09:24.690
You know the dessert we preordered?

09:24.773 --> 09:26.400
The same one from our honeymoon.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.402
-The same one.
-Not literally.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.696
Sure. That one has been excrement
for a long time.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.865
Wow. Very nice. I'll double check.

09:32.948 --> 09:33.949
So beautiful.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.868
-We haven't had one since.
-So unique.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.703
-Can't wait to see it again.
-Excuse me.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.246
Like it was on our honeymoon.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.622
Feels like it was yesterday.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.457
-But it wasn't.
-Famously.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.710
Revolutions are great

09:44.793 --> 09:46.795
If you like them, that's great

09:46.879 --> 09:48.463
If you don't, then we're sorry

09:48.547 --> 09:50.048
Here, I know we're busy,

09:50.132 --> 09:52.885
but I'll make sure it's just like
you expect it, no matter what.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.095
If I couldn't juggle it all,
then who would I be?

09:55.179 --> 09:57.431
-That would be lovely.
-You juggle too much.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.682
You need a break.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.435
Though, we'd love some more dough slices
when you get a chance.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.904
A creature picked me!

10:11.987 --> 10:14.781
Uh-huh, sure. Now let me pick you
out of the trash before a neighbor sees.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.283
No, look.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.202
Let me go.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.370
I'm gonna tickle its spine
to show my friendship.

10:20.454 --> 10:24.333
No. That creature won't respond
with vibrations, but with wounds.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.959
Now, I need to get back to work.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.753
But I want it to live with us inside.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.463
This is not a creature roommate.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.966
This is an outside creature
who must remain a stranger. Okay?

10:33.634 --> 10:35.886
I don't accept this information
and will continue to be upset

10:35.969 --> 10:37.554
until you give me more context.

10:38.055 --> 10:39.890
Some creatures we can love inside,

10:39.973 --> 10:42.559
like moral creatures
and vibrating creatures.

10:42.643 --> 10:47.898
But that's a greyscale finger bandit
which we can only love from afar.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.400
No. Any creature can be a roommate.

10:50.484 --> 10:54.029
I'm afraid not. For many of them,
the outside is their inside.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.407
Then who decides
what creatures are allowed inside?

10:57.491 --> 11:00.702
Beings hundreds, maybe thousands,
of revolutions ago.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.412
Like, they saw snarling creatures,

11:02.496 --> 11:04.873
and over time,
made them into moral creatures.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.875
Can we do that
to the greyscale finger bandit?

11:06.959 --> 11:09.753
No, we can't.
And we just got new furniture.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.213
But how did they do it?

11:11.296 --> 11:13.632
The beings that made
the snarling creature into a roommate.

11:14.132 --> 11:17.302
Probably by giving it sustenance
and having it breed with its own relatives

11:17.386 --> 11:20.639
for many generations until its brain
got bad enough for it to love us.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.433
This isn't context I wanted to know.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.394
I know. That's how context is.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.563
It can make bad things good
and good things bad.

11:27.646 --> 11:29.189
Now, let's go inside.

11:29.273 --> 11:31.441
But I want them 'cause they have fingers.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.235
Like a snarling little sibling.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.695
Oh, my sweet legume.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.030
We can't get a greyscale finger bandit.

11:37.114 --> 11:40.742
But you know what?
We'll get you a proper creature roommate.

11:40.826 --> 11:41.827
Exciting, right?

11:41.910 --> 11:43.287
No, only them!

11:43.370 --> 11:46.498
I'm a greyscale finger bandit.
I love trash!

11:50.961 --> 11:53.297
Please, come out.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.966
I have treats, toys, fresh skin to claw.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.011
I have currency. Just tell me
what you want. I can make it happen.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.681
Help me help you help your roommate.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.183
It's a win-win-win.

12:07.895 --> 12:08.729
Hey.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.981
So, I don't know how to say this.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.108
Let me guess.
The vibrating creature is hiding,

12:13.192 --> 12:15.068
but it needs lung juice
in the next two minutes,

12:15.152 --> 12:18.030
and you're calling for help because you're
so infatuated with the Manager,

12:18.113 --> 12:19.615
your brain isn't working right.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.534
Oddly specific. But yes, exactly.

12:22.618 --> 12:25.537
-I'll see you soon.
-Gratitude. Real gratitude.

12:26.872 --> 12:27.873
Oh, Lorb.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.543
Were you waiting for me to give up?

12:31.627 --> 12:33.629
Forget it. I don't care why, just remain.

12:34.755 --> 12:38.383
Remain. Yes. Remain.

12:40.344 --> 12:43.430
And breathe. Yes.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.309
Yes, you're going to live and--

12:48.143 --> 12:51.230
Uh-oh, not now.

12:56.235 --> 12:59.279
Table 22 found a paper clip
in their leaf bucket.

12:59.363 --> 13:01.698
I told them it was good luck,
but they didn't buy it.

13:01.782 --> 13:05.077
And the couple that loves you
is ready for their dessert.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.750
That's a health code violation.
I don't mind it.

13:12.918 --> 13:13.919
Everything okay?

13:14.002 --> 13:15.963
Yes, I just need a moment.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.130
Take two.

13:21.927 --> 13:22.928
Oh, no.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.138
Hi.

13:25.222 --> 13:29.351
Hi. You sound happy. I assume all is well?

13:29.434 --> 13:31.019
Yes. All is very well.

13:31.687 --> 13:34.314
No deception, I am relieved to hear that.

13:34.398 --> 13:35.482
Did they take their inhaler?

13:35.566 --> 13:37.860
Yep.
They took it without any problem at all.

13:38.402 --> 13:39.945
Total cooperation.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.864
Wow, that is impressive.

13:41.947 --> 13:44.449
It often takes me several attempts
to get them to sit still.

13:44.533 --> 13:45.534
Does it?

13:46.326 --> 13:50.455
I cannot tell you how appreciative I am
of this favor. I owe you one in return.

13:50.539 --> 13:52.958
No, you don't. That's up to you.

13:53.041 --> 13:58.088
Apologies.
Is my creature a light shade of red?

13:58.172 --> 13:59.548
What? No.

14:00.257 --> 14:01.717
That must be your machine.

14:02.593 --> 14:03.927
Not light red at all.

14:04.011 --> 14:09.183
Okay, I will try to get home
as soon as I can. And again, gratitude.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.021
Blink if you have magical powers.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.110
Ready to set it ablaze?

14:20.194 --> 14:21.195
-Yes.
-Wait.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.906
Look, the side is concave

14:23.989 --> 14:26.992
but in the photo convex
and the frosting there.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.327
No, it's all wrong.

14:28.827 --> 14:29.828
It's close enough.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.205
It's their 50th anniversary.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.707
Well, the pastry chef is out sick.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.751
Poor being's ears must be clogged.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.377
They had their music blasting.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.714
Hand me the pastry chef's hat.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.675
I only see the sous chef's hat.

14:44.176 --> 14:46.053
Then that'll have to do.

14:47.221 --> 14:49.598
Actually,
I don't need a specific hat for this.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.725
It just felt right to say in the moment.

14:56.063 --> 15:00.526
You must be so excited to pick out
any creature roommate you want.

15:01.318 --> 15:02.945
This one's fluffy.

15:03.695 --> 15:04.988
Too vibrating.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.115
They look fun.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.786
Instead of vibrating,
they wiggle their butt spine.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.499
-Too moral.
-Uh-huh.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.462
This one's colorful and has no morals.

15:20.546 --> 15:22.381
Not enough fingers.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.674
Okay.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.551
Those are finger-ish?

15:25.634 --> 15:26.844
Not enough trash.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.346
Then, come on, what do you want?

15:30.722 --> 15:32.474
Where are your greyscale finger bandits?

15:32.558 --> 15:33.809
They're about yea high.

15:33.892 --> 15:37.062
They have lots of creepy little fingers
and they sing like this--

15:40.232 --> 15:43.277
I'm afraid we don't adopt them.
The outside is their home.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.487
Then I will join them.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.197
No. Sweet legume, careful.

15:54.288 --> 15:57.875
We've got two hours to fix this.
Or they will never speak to me again.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.836
I hate to say it, but this is a real,
"I knew this was going to happen

16:00.919 --> 16:03.797
and it's exactly why I tried to stop you
from doing it" moment.

16:03.881 --> 16:05.924
That is deception.
You are thrilled to say it.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.217
That is correct.

16:07.301 --> 16:10.846
I think you should just call them
and be honest about what happened.

16:10.929 --> 16:14.016
It's too late for honesty.
I have told too many deceptions.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.435
Now, let's get serious and remove
this mild poison stain

16:16.518 --> 16:17.895
out of the creature's fur.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.190
What-- How did you?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.778
That was dangerous. Very dangerous.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.363
Now, you stay here and heal.

16:28.447 --> 16:31.450
If you leave this room, we're not getting
any creature, you understand?

16:50.302 --> 16:52.387
Got a big pile of trash up here.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.853
Do they have mineral sprinkles
and fizzy liquid?

16:59.937 --> 17:01.813
I only see big wet crystals
and bubble fluid.

17:04.525 --> 17:05.817
Don't-- What--

17:12.950 --> 17:17.287
What if we pour white mild poison
onto the red mild poison stain,

17:17.371 --> 17:18.539
you know, cancel it out?

17:18.622 --> 17:19.623
What?

17:26.839 --> 17:29.091
Tilt a pan over the flame and voilÃ .

17:38.350 --> 17:40.894
You came, you're picking me. Here.

17:42.521 --> 17:45.482
Wait. No, I have other snacks. Wait.

17:45.566 --> 17:48.861
How is the stain larger?

17:49.903 --> 17:53.031
I give up. I will have to move again.
I don't want to move again.

17:53.115 --> 17:56.451
Perhaps I can have a disguise from now on.
I'll add an accessory, wear a hat.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.245
My head is too small for hats.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.999
Sibling, you need to compose yourself.

18:04.877 --> 18:06.128
I am unable to.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.798
Things don't always go as planned.
Every being knows that.

18:09.882 --> 18:12.968
And if you like this being,
then you need to be honest.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.137
A partnership can't start with deception.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.472
Partnership?
They will not want to be partners

18:17.556 --> 18:21.101
after they find out I spilled mild poison
on their favorite creature.

18:21.185 --> 18:22.936
They will ask me to leave
and ban me from the restaurant

18:23.020 --> 18:24.521
and I'll be forced
to drink good jitter liquid

18:24.605 --> 18:25.647
from a better establishment.

18:25.731 --> 18:27.107
You tried to win over the Manager

18:27.191 --> 18:30.903
like a being tries to win over a creature
with treats. You can't force it.

18:30.986 --> 18:33.989
You have to be yourself,
or you'll never know if it's real.

18:34.072 --> 18:37.367
Like, come here, like this. This is real.

18:37.451 --> 18:39.786
Okay, yeah, that is enough.

18:39.870 --> 18:42.956
You're right, all right.
I guess a sibling always does know.

18:45.334 --> 18:48.086
Hey, let go.
That cocoslab doesn't belong to you.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.547
Just take it. I don't think they care
about property rights.

19:12.152 --> 19:15.948
It's rude to steal and that cocoslab
will make you sick when you eat it.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.703
-Oh, well.
-All right.

19:21.787 --> 19:24.164
We could at least give
the vibrating creature a bath.

19:34.633 --> 19:36.260
Oh, my Lorb.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.427
Celebratory burn.

19:37.511 --> 19:40.222
I know. Sincere apologies.

19:40.305 --> 19:41.682
-Apologies?
-What's wrong?

19:41.765 --> 19:43.225
Your cake's late, it wasn't perfect.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.394
It had dripping frosting,
the wrong distribution--

19:45.477 --> 19:46.645
Oh my.

19:48.647 --> 19:49.731
That's a fire, dear.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.911
-How did you know?
-Know what?

20:02.995 --> 20:05.080
-Well, for our honeymoon--
-Everyone tells you

20:05.163 --> 20:08.584
-what you have to do to be happy.
-Do this, do that-- Okay.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.170
-So we went to this little islandâ€¦
-Well, it wasn't that little.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.630
-â€¦with all these plansâ€¦
-These expectations.

20:13.714 --> 20:14.631
â€¦and it rained.

20:14.715 --> 20:17.176
Raining vibrating creatures
and moral creatures.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.677
Just like these sprinklers.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.804
But you know
what's kept us together this long?

20:20.888 --> 20:22.389
You made backup plans?

20:22.472 --> 20:25.392
-We stopped being scared.
-Of others' expectations.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.476
To make everything perfect.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.146
Anyone can force love
in the perfect moments.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.981
-So they mean nothing--
-Well, not nothing.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.608
But finding love in the rain.

20:32.691 --> 20:34.776
-In the sprinklers.
-In the chaos.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.153
The sheer chaos.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.864
The love not trying
to make anyone else happy.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.991
That's the only way to know it's real.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.330
That's beautiful.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.665
Probably should give this
a little tidy up though.

20:48.749 --> 20:51.084
And would love those dough slices
when you get a chance.

20:51.168 --> 20:54.838
Great job tonight. You helped us
in a pinch like you always do.

20:54.922 --> 20:56.548
Why don't you take
the rest of the night off?

20:56.632 --> 20:59.593
-My shift ends in ten minutes.
-You're welcome.

21:02.179 --> 21:05.933
They picked the neighbor. Not me.
They'll never be my--

21:06.725 --> 21:07.726
Roommate!

21:08.393 --> 21:12.606
You like cocoslab?
I have cocoslab. Wait, I'm coming.

21:17.611 --> 21:22.824
I have cocoslab! Be my roommate?
Will you be my--

21:22.908 --> 21:25.410
Hey, careful now, neighbor.

21:25.494 --> 21:27.538
That's a wild creature.
They won't like it.

21:27.621 --> 21:30.332
No, that's my new roommate.
Look. They're beautiful. Look.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.752
Let me. They really are.

21:33.836 --> 21:35.754
-They all are.
-All?

21:37.297 --> 21:40.634
-It has a family.
-You're surprised?

21:40.717 --> 21:43.762
I just-- I wanted the greyscale
finger bandit to be my roommate,

21:43.846 --> 21:47.140
but it already has its own tiny roommates.

21:47.224 --> 21:50.894
There you are.
You are in big trouble, little being.

21:50.978 --> 21:54.356
I know now the finger bandit,
they can't be my inside roommate,

21:54.439 --> 21:57.442
but I will be their best friend outside.

21:57.526 --> 22:00.529
I-- Yeah, that's right.

22:00.612 --> 22:05.284
That's very sweet to not try to force it
to be something against its nature.

22:05.868 --> 22:07.452
We all deserve that, right?

22:07.536 --> 22:10.789
I'm not sure. I'm six and there's too much
new context coming my way.

22:10.873 --> 22:14.126
Well, I have a creature roommate
who I'd love for you to meet

22:14.209 --> 22:16.837
and, if you'd like,
help give them their lung juice.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.505
Wait, what kind of juice?

22:18.589 --> 22:20.424
-What am I gonna do?
-Greetings.

22:20.507 --> 22:23.802
I mean, uh-huh, greetings to you as well.

22:24.887 --> 22:29.099
I-- So I have to tell you
before you see your vibrating creature.

22:30.726 --> 22:34.271
I know they're pink. I'm sorry.

22:34.354 --> 22:39.943
But-- okay, honest, honestly, be myself.

22:40.027 --> 22:42.905
I brought over some mild poison
for you to enjoy at the end of your night.

22:42.988 --> 22:45.407
Then I proceeded to spill it
on your creature.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.826
A ravenous greyscale finger bandit
entered your home

22:47.910 --> 22:50.329
and ate the cocoslab
I also brought for you to enjoy.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.748
I then diluted the color
of your creature's fur in the bath

22:52.831 --> 22:55.375
and considered fleeing the Burg
or at least wearing a hat.

22:55.459 --> 22:57.211
It has been complete chaos.

22:59.046 --> 23:00.047
Chaos.

23:00.881 --> 23:02.382
Very much so. Yes.

23:03.091 --> 23:06.011
Sometimes there's
a lot of good to find in chaos.

23:06.094 --> 23:09.473
They look stunning and so strange.

23:09.556 --> 23:10.933
It's an odd combination.

23:11.016 --> 23:13.143
But you're good at those.

23:13.644 --> 23:18.398
But I'm not good with creatures.
I just-- I wanted you to like me.

23:18.482 --> 23:21.777
-But you did give them the lung juice?
-Yeah.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.487
-Are they alive?
-Definitely.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.947
Then I am grateful.

23:25.447 --> 23:28.951
I really wanted a night off,
but if I had the night off,

23:29.034 --> 23:31.787
I wouldn't have returned home
to a gorgeous pink creature.

23:31.870 --> 23:35.165
I wouldn't have served
my anniversary couple their fiery cake.

23:35.249 --> 23:37.751
I wouldn't be here right now
talking to you.

23:38.502 --> 23:41.463
So maybe everything happens for a reason.

23:42.172 --> 23:43.549
I did also clog your toilet.

23:45.133 --> 23:47.427
Do you think creatures really love us?

23:47.928 --> 23:51.223
I mean, I know physically loving
a creature or a being

23:51.306 --> 23:53.308
it's just chemicals and flesh wires.

23:53.392 --> 23:54.643
I think they do.

23:54.726 --> 23:58.939
We may never know if it feels the same,
but there is definitely love.

23:59.022 --> 24:01.233
They may love us more
when we give them treats,

24:01.316 --> 24:02.568
but we can't blame them for that.

24:02.651 --> 24:05.237
Many beings love each other more
for similar reasons.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.197
We are all imperfect.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.032
Maybe that's the takeaway.

24:10.158 --> 24:12.536
We too may be imperfect and strange,

24:12.619 --> 24:14.997
but they love us for who we are anyway.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.917
And because of that, we can learn how
to love other beings from them.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.460
Did you just come up with that?

24:20.544 --> 24:22.796
My lifegiver had
a sign like that in their kitchen.

24:23.922 --> 24:24.923
Long sign.

24:27.718 --> 24:31.555
Still wanna have fuzz juice orb
with cocoslab together sometime?

24:32.556 --> 24:33.557
Sometime?

24:34.057 --> 24:36.643
Yeah, I'd like that.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.941
Hey, feels like I shouldn't be here,

24:43.025 --> 24:45.652
but let me know if you want me
to come back and finish cleaning.

24:46.695 --> 24:47.696
Okay, bye.
