00:06.040 --> 00:08.240
Previously on ''Stargate SG-1'';

00:08.360 --> 00:09.960
Cassandra?

00:10.080 --> 00:12.400
What are you doing?

00:12.520 --> 00:14.000
lt helps, to do this.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.280
''Hok'tar'' is a hybrid
of two Goa'uld words.

00:16.400 --> 00:20.960
''Hok'', which means advanced, and
''tar'', which l believe is a sort of slang.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.280
- For...?
- Human.

00:23.360 --> 00:26.400
So essentially,
it's ''advanced human''. ''Hok Tauri.''

00:26.520 --> 00:29.440
An advanced human would be
a powerful host for the Goa'uld.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.920
Which explains why Nirrti
was experimenting.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.720
A few thousand years on another world
have changed you more than you know.

00:57.320 --> 01:01.000
l can make you more powerful
than you could imagine.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.560
The powers you have seen
in Wodan and the others?

01:04.640 --> 01:06.800
Only a fraction of what l could give you.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.680
l must apologise, Colonel.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.840
This is a meagre feast to offer
visitors from another world.

01:17.360 --> 01:22.080
No need to apologise.
lt appears delicious.

01:22.200 --> 01:26.720
We are a poor people. We are forced
to spend most of our time in the mines.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.480
- For the greater glory of Baal.
- Of course.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.800
According to our information,

01:34.880 --> 01:38.640
Baal abandoned this planet 100 years ago,
when the naqahdah mines went dry.

01:38.760 --> 01:42.800
The naqahdah is scarce and difficult
to extract, but there are deposits.

01:42.880 --> 01:46.080
Are you feeling unwell, Jonas Quinn?

01:46.200 --> 01:48.880
l'm fine. Just... lt's hot.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.480
We have not seen Lord Baal
for many generations,

01:52.560 --> 01:56.560
but we continue to offer him tribute
through his emissary Lord Mot.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.400
You expecting this guy soon?

01:58.480 --> 02:02.560
He will arrive in 12 days,
at the rising of the full moon.

02:08.919 --> 02:12.840
Stop talking like an old fool.
lt would be madness to defy Lord Mot.

02:15.160 --> 02:19.240
With each passing year,
the mining grows more difficult.

02:19.360 --> 02:23.040
Soon it may be impossible
to meet Lord Mot's demands.

02:23.120 --> 02:26.960
But we have no choice.
They are gods, after all.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.240
Are they not?

02:30.760 --> 02:33.160
They have great power.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.880
- That is true. However...
- Ellori.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.080
However... what?

02:46.560 --> 02:48.720
We have an ancient prophecy

02:48.800 --> 02:51.920
that one day strangers would
come through the Chaapa-ai

02:52.000 --> 02:54.880
to slay the gods and free our people.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.680
Now you have arrived.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.880
And you also carry
weapons of great power.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.600
Stop talking like an old fool.
lt would be madness to defy Lord Mot.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.080
Jonas?

03:14.960 --> 03:16.880
l need some air.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.400
Jonas.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.480
Preliminary tests seem to indicate
that Jonas is in perfect health.

04:36.560 --> 04:41.000
But given his history with naquadria
research, l decided to do an MRl.

04:41.120 --> 04:45.000
Now, it shows an area of unusual
brain activity right about here.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.360
- Any explanation?
- No, sir.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.640
l don't know if this is linked with
what happened on the planet.

04:50.720 --> 04:54.240
l had a dizzy spell.
lt was probably the food.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.280
Maybe, but l don't wanna
take any chances.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.880
- l've scheduled some follow-up exams.
- Very well.

05:09.280 --> 05:13.280
According to Tok'ra intelligence,
not only did Baal abandon P4S-237

05:13.360 --> 05:14.840
over a hundred years ago,

05:14.960 --> 05:19.200
but he no longer receives any
naqahdah shipments from the planet.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.000
- Where's it going?
- Perhaps Lord Mot is keeping it himself.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.840
What do we know about him?

05:25.920 --> 05:29.600
He was the Canaanite god of death.
According to mythology,

05:29.680 --> 05:33.120
he was defeated by Baal
and forced to live in the underworld.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.000
ln all likelihood,
there was a power struggle.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.280
Baal defeated Mot and
forced him into servitude.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.920
Maybe he doesn't want to serve any more.

05:42.040 --> 05:45.120
lf he is stockpiling naqahdah
without Baal's knowledge,

05:45.240 --> 05:46.880
he may move against him.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.880
lf Baal no longer has any knowledge
of what's happening on the planet,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.280
we could possibly free these people.

05:53.400 --> 05:58.000
lf the System Lords think the planet's
worthless, nobody will take his place.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.880
Did they ask for our help?

06:00.960 --> 06:04.720
- Mm... not exactly.
- l think they were afraid to ask directly.

06:04.840 --> 06:08.480
But they did hint that they no longer
believe the Goa'uld are gods.

06:08.600 --> 06:12.800
- What do you think, Colonel?
- We'll need a lot more intel.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.960
Hey.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.560
You wanna get some lunch?
lt's Mexican today.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.880
Ellori says Mot isn't due to
return for another 12 days.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.480
- That gives us plenty of time.
- l'll contact the Pentagon.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.440
Hey.

06:43.560 --> 06:47.440
You wanna get some lunch?
lt's Mexican today.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.080
- What?
- l knew you were gonna say that.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.160
What are you talking about?

06:54.280 --> 06:57.960
Before, when we were in
the briefing room, l had a...

06:58.080 --> 07:01.040
l don't know. lt was like a vision.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.920
l was standing here holding this notebook.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.280
You came in and said what you said.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.760
When you think you're reliving
a moment, it's called déjà vu.

07:09.840 --> 07:13.600
lt's normal. lt's caused by
a split-second delay in sense perception.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.680
No, this was different.

07:16.800 --> 07:21.640
lt was the same on the planet.
l saw something, and then it happened.

07:22.440 --> 07:25.200
- When?
- Just before l passed out.

07:26.800 --> 07:32.080
l didn't think anything of it at the time,
but now it's happened twice.

07:38.720 --> 07:42.800
Sir? We just completed a second MRl.

07:42.880 --> 07:47.120
There's nothing to suggest that Jonas'
exposure to naquadria is linked to this.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.800
According to Major Carter,
he claims to be having visions.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.520
He's also beginning to
suffer from headaches.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.880
The symptoms are similar to
those of the scientists on Kelowna,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.920
but there are no indications
of schizophrenia.

08:00.040 --> 08:04.640
There is, however, a small spot
on this MRl that has me worried.

08:04.760 --> 08:09.040
- You know what it is?
- l'm not sure, but it could be a tumour.

08:09.160 --> 08:13.440
- ls this what caused him to pass out?
- lt's possible.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.680
Sir, l think it would be best
if you took Jonas off active duty.

08:21.680 --> 08:25.920
- This is ridiculous.
- Fraiser's just coverin' all the bases.

08:26.040 --> 08:30.080
Something else has to be going on here.
Whatever she saw in that MRl

08:30.160 --> 08:35.360
has to have something to do with these
visions. lt can't be just coincidence.

08:38.200 --> 08:43.320
You guys didn't believe me when l saw
those alien creatures. They were real.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.680
So you're seeing things
before they happen.

08:51.320 --> 08:54.400
- That's right.
- Like what's for lunch?

08:57.600 --> 09:01.040
No, l can't control it. lt just flashes.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.960
We have encountered
many strange phenomena,

09:05.080 --> 09:08.920
but we have yet to meet anyone
that could see the future.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.800
lt goes against all the laws of physics
as we understand them.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.600
Have you had any more?

09:19.400 --> 09:21.360
Jonas?

09:24.120 --> 09:26.320
The Tok'ra are coming.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.920
(Stargate alarm)

09:31.000 --> 09:34.360
(man over PA) Unscheduled
offworld activation.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.400
Her name is Sina.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.720
SG-1 , this is Sina of the Tok'ra.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.360
We have further information
about the System Lord Baal.

09:56.560 --> 10:00.320
- ls there a problem?
- No, sir.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.520
Please.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.440
Baal has suffered a recent
military defeat by Lord Yu.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.200
Anubis is very disappointed.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.160
lt's hard to believe that
Yu hasn't been destroyed.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.200
As he is the only System Lord
still in opposition to Anubis,

10:23.320 --> 10:27.200
- his persistence is remarkable.
- You go, Yu.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.640
Baal's recent campaign
was meant to be a final blow.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.040
But Yu escaped, and Baal suffered
heavy losses in the process.

10:39.160 --> 10:42.920
So he screwed up,
and his boss is pissed at him now.

10:44.360 --> 10:49.200
lf l understand you correctly,
yes, that would be a fair assessment.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.200
Clearly Baal is vulnerable. This may be
an ideal time for Mot to move against him.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.040
lf he becomes a System Lord,

10:57.120 --> 11:01.200
he won't have to keep his operation on
237 secret. He could garrison the planet.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.400
So if we're gonna help them,
we'd better do it soon.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.680
Another headache?

11:16.640 --> 11:18.640
Yeah.

11:19.960 --> 11:25.520
None of us had met that Tok'ra before.
You couldn't have known her name.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.280
l can't explain it.
l saw her in the briefing room,

11:29.360 --> 11:32.960
General Hammond said her name,
then a few minutes later it happened.

11:33.040 --> 11:37.360
Teal'c said you've never encountered
aliens with precognitive abilities.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.440
Yeah, we haven't.

11:39.520 --> 11:43.120
But we have come across
other psychic powers.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.160
On P3X-367.

11:46.240 --> 11:49.680
Wodan was telekinetic,
Eggar was telepathic.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.640
- Then Cassandra...
- You think Nirrti is involved?

11:54.760 --> 12:00.480
lt's very possible. She had me in that
gene-splicing machine for over an hour.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.280
What if she did something to me?

12:08.120 --> 12:10.000
lt's hard to say without a biopsy,

12:10.080 --> 12:14.080
but all tests indicate that the tumour
is not made up of cancer cells.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.040
- Then what is it?
- l'm not sure.

12:17.160 --> 12:21.440
But l do know that it's grown
by over 50 per cent since the last test.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.520
l've never seen anything like it.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.640
- What can we do?
- l recommend immediate surgery.

12:26.720 --> 12:31.680
lf we don't get it out of him soon,
the intracranial pressure will kill him.

12:36.520 --> 12:40.880
l've called in a neurosurgeon,
Dr Sandy Van Densen. She's the best.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.760
l'm not completely convinced that surgery
is the right way to deal with this.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.960
- Jonas, it's going to kill you.
- You don't know that.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.520
We don't even know what it is.

12:51.640 --> 12:55.840
Jonas and l think it's possible that
this has something to do with Nirrti,

12:55.960 --> 12:58.520
that it's a step towards
the creation of a Hok'tar.

12:58.600 --> 13:02.000
So you think this is the result
of genetic manipulation.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.520
Jonas thinks the new tissue in his brain

13:05.600 --> 13:08.640
is somehow giving him
precognitive abilities.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.640
For all l know, you may be right.

13:10.720 --> 13:15.840
But if this tumour continues to grow at
its current rate, it is still going to kill you.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.840
lt may stabilise.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.440
Nirrti never did anything to anyone
that didn't turn out badly.

13:21.560 --> 13:27.440
Colonel, you of all people should realise
what an advantage this could be.

13:27.520 --> 13:31.280
lmagine if we knew in advance when
the next Goa'uld attack would come.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.240
You have yet to provide
such valuable information.

13:34.360 --> 13:38.080
All l'm saying is just
give me some more time.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.320
At least 48 hours.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.600
Make it 24, and you'll remain
on base for observation.

13:43.720 --> 13:47.040
- What about the mission?
- You're going to sit this one out.

13:47.120 --> 13:51.200
Colonel, l want you to take the rest
of SG-1 and SG-15 back to the planet

13:51.320 --> 13:53.520
for a full tactical assessment.

13:53.600 --> 13:58.080
lf there's a chance we can free these
people from the Goa'uld, l wanna know.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.120
Yes, sir.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.600
Dismissed.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.680
Blood pressure's a little high.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.400
- How are the headaches?
- Not good.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.400
Jonas, why are you doing this?

14:21.640 --> 14:26.240
Even limited precognitive abilities
would be invaluable to our work.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.040
You still think you have to keep
proving yourself, don't you?

14:33.280 --> 14:38.400
You should consider the possibility
that you're valuable enough already.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.560
- Let's run another EEG.
- Yes, Doctor.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.160
Jonas?

14:58.160 --> 15:01.280
- How's she doing?
- Respirations are shallow, pulse weak.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.800
Sam, can you hear me? Sam?

15:03.920 --> 15:07.360
- l've lost the pulse.
- She's in V fib.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.040
- Anything?
- Nothing.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.800
- Charge to 200.
- (nurse) Charging.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.120
(Dr Fraiser) Clear

15:20.400 --> 15:22.000
Jonas

15:31.040 --> 15:33.040
Colonel Colonel

15:33.920 --> 15:36.000
You have to scrub the mission.

15:36.080 --> 15:40.080
- Why?
- Major Carter gets hurt. l saw it.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.760
Colonel O'Neill, what the hell's
going on down there?

15:45.920 --> 15:47.600
lt was a medical emergency.

15:47.720 --> 15:53.040
Major Carter was rushed to the infirmary
with what looked like a staff blast wound.

15:54.080 --> 15:57.600
According to the villagers,
we won't encounter Jaffa for days.

15:57.680 --> 16:01.440
Maybe they're wrong or maybe
they lied. We can't know for sure.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.880
That's just it, Jonas.
There's no way we can know.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.760
Maybe it won't happen this time.

16:07.880 --> 16:11.040
- lt could be weeks from now.
- l can't see that far ahead.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.920
We can't second-guess every decision.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.440
lt's a risk every time
we step through that gate.

16:16.560 --> 16:20.080
l agree. But until we have a better
understanding of what's going on,

16:20.200 --> 16:22.400
l'd prefer to err on the side of caution.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.040
Was anybody else hurt on this thing?

16:26.080 --> 16:28.720
l only saw Major Carter.

16:28.840 --> 16:33.280
Then she can sit this one out,
just to be on the safe side.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.680
Agreed, but, Colonel, be careful.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.760
Yes, sir.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.080
Major Pierce, report.

16:52.200 --> 16:56.240
We swept the whole village, sir.
There's no sign of any Jaffa activity.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.680
As l said, Lord Mot
will not arrive for many days.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.600
All right, stay sharp. O'Neill, out.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.240
Have you decided to help us?

17:08.280 --> 17:11.440
- Are you sure you want this?
- lt is as the prophecy foretold.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.119
Now, screw the prophecy.

17:14.200 --> 17:18.240
l need to know your people are
willing to follow through on this.

17:18.359 --> 17:22.400
Last winter, there was
a terrible sickness in the village.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.319
Many could not work.

17:24.440 --> 17:28.800
When Lord Mot arrived and there was not
enough naqahdah, we tried to explain.

17:28.880 --> 17:32.880
We begged his forgiveness,
but he would not listen.

17:33.960 --> 17:39.920
He took ten of the sickest,
including my daughter's husband,

17:41.320 --> 17:44.840
and executed them
in front of the whole village.

17:45.880 --> 17:49.640
We would do anything
to be free of this burden.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.360
(alarm)

18:51.480 --> 18:56.400
(man over PA) We have
a medical emergency on level 25.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.720
What happened?

19:04.840 --> 19:08.640
We were overhauling the gate generator.
The capacitor blew.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.360
- Anybody else hurt?
- Major Carter.

19:17.640 --> 19:21.080
- How's she doing?
- Respirations are shallow, pulse weak.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.760
Sam, can you hear me? Sam?

19:23.880 --> 19:26.560
- l've lost the pulse.
- She's in V fib.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.600
- Anything?
- Nothing.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.800
- Charge to 200.
- Charging.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.040
- Clear
- Clear.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.680
- What do we got?
- Pulse is back. Regular signs.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.040
OK. Let's get them both into
the infirmary. Let's move.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.320
Thanks.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.520
- Hey.
- How you feeling?

19:59.640 --> 20:02.720
Slightly overcooked.
Janet says l'll be fine.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.200
- Sam, l'm sorry.
- For what?

20:09.320 --> 20:12.160
lf l had kept quiet,
you would've gone on the mission.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.840
This wouldn't have happened.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.120
l envisioned it,
but l didn't understand it.

20:17.200 --> 20:21.440
l misinterpreted the vision.
l won't make that same mistake again.

20:21.560 --> 20:26.240
- Don't do this to yourself.
- l've been thinking about this a lot.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.400
l've always been hyper-observant.

20:28.480 --> 20:32.240
l see details that other people miss.
l see patterns.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.560
Maybe predicting the future
is just an extension of that.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.920
lt doesn't work that way.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.880
According to Newtonian physics, yes.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.760
lf you knew the position
and velocity of every particle

20:43.880 --> 20:45.920
in the universe at any given time,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.880
you could predict
all of their interactions for ever.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.520
So the future is predetermined.
You just need to figure it out.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.680
Yes, but quantum mechanics
blows that out of the water.

20:57.800 --> 21:02.560
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says
it's impossible to see a subatomic particle

21:02.680 --> 21:05.800
and know both where it is
and where it's going at the same time.

21:05.920 --> 21:10.560
The more you fix its position, the more
uncertain its velocity, and vice versa.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.680
We can only calculate probabilities.

21:12.800 --> 21:17.200
OK, so then l'm seeing
probable futures.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.080
Maybe.

21:20.160 --> 21:24.560
But every vision l've had has
turned out exactly the way l saw it.

21:24.680 --> 21:27.760
lt doesn't mean they always will, Jonas.

21:33.640 --> 21:38.320
- Does Mot arrive through the Stargate?
- No, he usually arrives by ship.

21:38.440 --> 21:41.000
- Where does he land?
- Here.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.720
- (Teal'c) How many Jaffa?
- Eight, maybe ten.

21:46.040 --> 21:49.800
Clearly, he's not anticipating resistance.

21:49.920 --> 21:54.480
Colonel, we can do this.
There's plenty of cover here and here.

21:54.600 --> 21:58.480
- They'd never know what hit 'em.
- We'll do a sweep of the area tomorrow.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.000
- l will show you.
- Old fool.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.040
Chazen.

22:03.120 --> 22:07.120
These outsiders have led you astray,
but l've taken care of everything.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.360
- What'd you do?
- (spaceship overhead)

22:11.080 --> 22:12.560
A scout ship.

22:12.680 --> 22:15.200
Lord Mot is coming.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.760
Jonas, we need to go over
these test results...

22:21.840 --> 22:23.840
Jonas

22:31.160 --> 22:34.320
This is Fraiser. l need
a medical team to level 18 L-7.

22:40.520 --> 22:45.440
You know, every time
l wake up in Goa'uld cell,

22:46.560 --> 22:50.800
l can't help the thought that
something bad is gonna happen.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.960
You are the Tauri of Stargate Command.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.520
And you are Lord Mot,

23:00.520 --> 23:04.320
come to punish us for our insolence,
et cetera, yada, et al.

23:04.960 --> 23:07.920
- That is correct.
- Yeah.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.240
Mr Mot, we're onto you.

23:10.320 --> 23:13.680
We know what you've got planned
and we've informed the Tok'ra.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.480
lf we don't report back on schedule,

23:16.600 --> 23:19.280
they're gonna rat you out,
tell your boss.

23:19.400 --> 23:22.400
You intend to send a warning to Baal.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.240
l think that's what l said, isn't it?

23:28.360 --> 23:30.160
l said that.

23:30.240 --> 23:33.040
l think this is unlikely.

23:33.160 --> 23:37.200
You would not be here if you did not wish
to protect the people of this planet.

23:37.320 --> 23:41.520
lf Baal discovers the mines
are still active, he will return.

23:41.600 --> 23:45.040
- There will be no message.
- Baal is in the service of Anubis.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.600
lf you kill him, you will
have to answer for it.

23:47.680 --> 23:52.320
- You may be of assistance in that regard.
- l don't think so.

23:52.400 --> 23:56.160
lt is known among the System Lords
that an iris protects your gate.

23:56.280 --> 24:00.640
Obviously, you must transmit some code
before you return to your planet.

24:00.760 --> 24:04.160
l suspect you use one of these.

24:07.880 --> 24:13.280
You will tell me the code, and l will
use it to destroy Stargate Command.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.880
Anubis will congratulate me
on my... initiative.

24:19.560 --> 24:24.480
- We will tell you nothing.
- Not at first. But eventually.

24:26.960 --> 24:30.800
However, for the moment,
l must deal with these villagers.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.600
l cannot let their treachery go unpunished.

24:33.680 --> 24:38.560
- They had nothing to do with this.
- My spy tells me otherwise.

24:39.960 --> 24:44.800
Of course, l could be convinced
to spare them some discomfort.

24:50.680 --> 24:55.200
Very well, then.
l'll leave you to think about it.

25:13.840 --> 25:16.000
What am l doing here?

25:16.080 --> 25:19.600
You had a seizure.
We can't wait any longer, Jonas.

25:19.680 --> 25:24.320
lf this tumour gets much bigger,
we may not be able to remove it safely.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.320
- Right.
- What is it?

25:32.080 --> 25:34.800
Sir, l'm receiving an lDC. lt's SG-15.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.880
- Open the iris.
- Yes, sir.

25:47.080 --> 25:50.000
- SG-15, this is Hammond. Come in.
- (static)

25:50.120 --> 25:53.040
Repeat, this is General Hammond.
Please respond.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.760
(alarm)

27:03.840 --> 27:06.480
l need to talk to General Hammond.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.880
Now

27:11.920 --> 27:14.280
When you closed the iris, it was too late.

27:14.400 --> 27:19.120
They set off a bomb that destroyed the
gate room, maybe the whole mountain.

27:19.240 --> 27:22.480
- You sure it was SG-15's iris code?
- Positive.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.840
We have to warn them.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.960
But maybe sending a message
causes this to happen.

27:27.040 --> 27:30.240
- Like when you warned Major Carter?
- Yeah.

27:30.320 --> 27:33.840
Jonas, we've been over this.
The future isn't predetermined.

27:33.960 --> 27:37.920
Without other information,
we have to follow normal procedure.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.720
lf l didn't have this vision,
we wouldn't be talking.

27:40.840 --> 27:44.520
- We're already beyond normal procedure.
- What do you suggest?

27:44.640 --> 27:48.720
We need more information. We need
to know how the Jaffa get the iris code.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.800
Maybe l can find that out.

27:50.880 --> 27:54.560
- You can't control the visions.
- l haven't tried hard enough.

27:54.640 --> 27:59.560
No. Jonas, if we don't get you into
surgery right now, you could die.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.400
l need just a little more time.

28:09.040 --> 28:13.280
Excuse me, miss. How about
sending a little of that our w...

28:13.400 --> 28:15.040
w... way?

28:23.680 --> 28:25.760
Or not.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.800
Wow. What'd you put in that stuff?

28:28.920 --> 28:31.920
Kelmina root. They will
sleep for many hours.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.360
l retrieved this. Chazen has
the rest of your belongings.

28:35.480 --> 28:39.360
- l dared not take more.
- Where's your father?

28:39.440 --> 28:42.640
He's being held. Lord Mot intends
to make an example of him.

28:42.720 --> 28:46.480
We can help him. But we have to get
to the gate to get reinforcements.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.640
l understand.

28:48.720 --> 28:52.000
- How do we get out?
- This way.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.680
Boys.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.000
You think that'll help?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.440
lt works for Teal'c.

29:08.760 --> 29:11.360
- Jonas?
- l'm OK.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.840
We're good to go.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.320
Teal'c

31:14.640 --> 31:16.800
Jonas?

31:16.920 --> 31:18.720
- (mumbles)
- What?

31:18.800 --> 31:21.120
Jon... l need some help in here

31:21.760 --> 31:25.520
Get him on the bed. We've gotta get
him into surgery. Grab the gurney.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.280
Easy.

31:27.400 --> 31:30.160
- Jonas? Jonas.
- (groans)

31:32.440 --> 31:34.480
Jonas, can you hear me?

31:50.320 --> 31:53.200
This path will take you
to the Chaapa-ai.

31:54.120 --> 31:59.040
Colonel, l fear Mot will execute my father.
There is not much time.

31:59.120 --> 32:02.000
Just stay out of sight until we get back.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.280
Not yet.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.960
- What happened?
- We can't wait any longer.

32:16.080 --> 32:18.400
Sam... Sam...

32:21.080 --> 32:23.760
l saw. l know what's gonna happen.

32:25.320 --> 32:28.400
Sir, they're walking into an ambush.

32:28.520 --> 32:33.200
Jonas says the Jaffa will be waiting for
them at the gate. We must warn them.

32:33.320 --> 32:35.920
- Dial P4S-237.
- Yes, sir.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.960
We're ready, Doctor.

32:55.400 --> 32:58.880
lt's OK. Just relax.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.880
- What's happening?
- lt's OK.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.560
- What's going on?
- lt's OK.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.120
Get the lorazepam.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.680
lt's OK, Jonas.
lt's not your problem any more.

33:11.280 --> 33:15.680
(over radio) Colonel O'Neill?
This is Hammond. Please respond.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.760
Major Pierce, do you read me?

33:23.040 --> 33:26.080
Jonas believes there may be
a Jaffa presence

33:26.200 --> 33:28.400
awaiting your arrival at the Stargate.

33:28.960 --> 33:32.240
Exercise extreme caution
when approaching the gate.

33:32.360 --> 33:36.960
l repeat. Exercise extreme caution
when approaching the gate.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.440
You may be walking into an ambush.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.160
- Do you copy?
- Sendear.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.920
- Check on the prisoners.
- Yes, sir.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.320
Colonel O'Neill, do you copy?

33:51.280 --> 33:54.080
Major Pierce, do you read me?

33:54.200 --> 33:55.760
They could be out of range.

33:55.840 --> 33:58.640
Maybe they received the message
but can't respond.

33:58.760 --> 34:02.880
- What about the MALP?
- Not receiving anything, sir.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.600
Sir, SG-3 is prepped and ready to go.

34:05.680 --> 34:10.960
l just can't risk it, Major. l could be
sending them into an ambush.

34:11.080 --> 34:15.440
We're just going to have to hope
that O'Neill gets the message.

34:39.040 --> 34:41.320
The prisoners have escaped.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.480
Sound the alarm.

34:54.280 --> 34:56.320
(bugle)

34:58.880 --> 35:00.240
Pierce.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.280
- Who ordered the alarm?
- l did. The prisoners escaped.

35:15.360 --> 35:18.360
ldiot. l allowed that foolish girl
to help them.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.720
My Jaffa are waiting at the gate.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.280
l could not have known.
You must forgive me.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.760
You are mistaken.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.120
(gunshot)

35:33.720 --> 35:35.360
(thud)

35:35.480 --> 35:37.440
Scissors.

35:44.920 --> 35:49.280
There it is.
lt looks like an astrocytoma.

35:52.040 --> 35:53.360
lsn't that unusual?

35:53.480 --> 35:56.240
Given that the tissue isn't malignant, yes.

35:56.360 --> 36:01.640
We didn't see any evidence of it on
the MRl. This must be a recent formation.

36:01.760 --> 36:06.640
We've got reticular infiltrates.
This could get a little tricky.

36:17.320 --> 36:20.920
Blood pressure's dropping.
Heart rate's 120 and climbing.

36:22.920 --> 36:25.680
- He's haemorrhaging.
- l need more suction.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.360
l don't see it.

36:30.480 --> 36:34.000
Blood pressure's 80 on 60.
Heart rate's 160.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.360
We gotta find the bleeder. He's pre-arrest.

36:36.480 --> 36:39.040
Run a litre of saline.
Have dopamine standing by.

36:39.160 --> 36:41.040
Get a unit of O neg.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.720
- Pressure's 60 on 40.
- Doctor, we're losing him.

36:51.200 --> 36:54.800
Hold on. l see it. Retract this flap.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.640
l think l've got it.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.760
Pressure's coming up.
Heart rate's stabilising.

37:13.640 --> 37:17.520
OK. Let's get this thing out of him.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.160
Move, move

37:45.000 --> 37:46.360
Still no signal, sir.

37:54.600 --> 37:58.200
Sir, l'm receiving an lDC. lt's SG-15.

37:58.320 --> 38:01.520
SG-15, this is Hammond. Come in.

38:03.920 --> 38:07.840
Repeat, this is General Hammond.
Please respond.

38:10.400 --> 38:14.080
lf we don't open the iris and it is
Colonel O'Neill and SG-15, then...

38:14.160 --> 38:18.720
The second they step through,
they'll be killed. l'm aware of that.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.360
- Open the iris.
- Yes, sir.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.960
Got a wounded man here.

38:42.760 --> 38:44.720
(man) Clear the ramp.

38:48.520 --> 38:49.480
Good to see you.

38:49.600 --> 38:53.280
General, request permission to return
to the planet with SGs 3 and 10.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.960
- We have some unfinished business.
- Permission granted.

39:02.880 --> 39:06.240
- Expecting someone else, sir?
- We'll explain later.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.960
Hey

39:25.080 --> 39:28.240
l thought you were supposed
to be resting that brain.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.320
- (sighs)
- How you doing?

39:30.400 --> 39:34.880
l'm a little sick of staring at these walls,
but other than that l'm fine.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.640
Dr Fraiser thinks they got it all out.

39:37.720 --> 39:42.480
The post-op analysis said the tumour
was similar to ordinary brain tissue,

39:42.560 --> 39:45.520
but that the neurons were
five times more densely packed.

39:45.600 --> 39:49.200
Nirrti definitely had to have
something to do with this.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.880
This kind of thing doesn't
happen naturally.

39:51.960 --> 39:55.440
Are you still having visions, Jonas Quinn?

39:55.560 --> 39:57.360
Not since the surgery, no.

39:57.440 --> 40:02.240
So... no lottery numbers?

40:03.080 --> 40:06.960
- Afraid not.
- No trip to Vegas, just you and me?

40:10.800 --> 40:13.200
So how's it going on 237?

40:13.320 --> 40:15.760
They are planning a celebration
in our honour.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.120
They wanna thank us
for getting rid of Mot.

40:18.200 --> 40:21.040
- We're bringing the food this time.
- Good idea.

40:21.120 --> 40:24.960
All right, visiting hours are over.
Jonas, you need your rest.

40:25.760 --> 40:29.200
Well... get well soon.

40:30.680 --> 40:33.680
We need you out there.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.200
Yes, sir.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.720
ls he feeling all right?

40:40.840 --> 40:43.360
l knew he'd warm up to you eventually.

40:45.800 --> 40:50.640
You know, it is interesting.
We changed the way things played out,

40:50.720 --> 40:54.640
which would seem to indicate
that the future isn't predetermined.

40:54.720 --> 40:59.040
But by doing so, we fulfilled
an ancient prophecy.

40:59.160 --> 41:03.440
A thousand years ago, someone in that
village predicted this would happen.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.320
How do you explain that?

41:06.400 --> 41:08.360
Maybe it was just a lucky guess.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.480
Yeah.

41:17.120 --> 41:19.040
