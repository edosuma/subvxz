WEBVTT

01:57.924 --> 01:59.771
Julia.

02:00.159 --> 02:02.428
Sorry I'm a bit early. The train...

02:02.528 --> 02:06.110
Are you kidding me?
Earlier the better. Come in, please.

02:06.966 --> 02:09.314
I'm ready for you, okay?

02:18.094 --> 02:20.323
Can I take your coat?

02:23.416 --> 02:25.540
So this is the pad. It's...

02:25.640 --> 02:29.288
what happens when your dad
is the leading celebrity sports surgeon.

02:37.230 --> 02:39.577
Is there anything I can get you?

02:40.499 --> 02:42.347
Champagne?

02:43.669 --> 02:45.471
Perfect.

02:45.771 --> 02:48.253
Feel free to look around, alright?

03:06.359 --> 03:08.895
I'm sorry it took me so long to call.

03:08.995 --> 03:12.309
You know, after... ambulatory,
I went straight into the OR

03:12.409 --> 03:15.003
for the last couple months and...

03:15.103 --> 03:17.314
Holy Christ.

03:18.137 --> 03:19.806
I mean, talk about a nightmare.

03:19.906 --> 03:22.844
I don't ever remember
being on my feet that long...

03:22.944 --> 03:24.588
and...

03:24.688 --> 03:26.711
the blood, I mean...

03:26.979 --> 03:29.651
that's somethin' I could do without.

03:38.424 --> 03:40.672
How do you stand it?

03:42.328 --> 03:45.414
- What?
- The blood.

03:45.514 --> 03:48.406
How do you stand all that blood? I mean...

03:48.506 --> 03:52.063
I think I fainted every day
the entire first week.

03:52.338 --> 03:55.446
Guess it doesn't bother me that much.

03:56.709 --> 03:59.291
At least I know I'll never be my dad.

04:00.613 --> 04:02.850
I'm sorry, I'm bumblin' all over here.
It's just...

04:02.950 --> 04:05.884
you know, the moment
I saw you standing there...

04:05.984 --> 04:08.590
in your scrubs, lookin' all...

04:08.690 --> 04:10.882
sweet, and...

04:11.740 --> 04:13.922
I couldn't stop thinkin' about you.

04:17.997 --> 04:20.413
So here's to the holy grail of champagne.

04:22.135 --> 04:26.157
Shipwrecked 1907 Heidseick...

04:27.040 --> 04:29.042
and to you.

04:58.471 --> 05:00.557
One more before we go?

05:47.853 --> 05:50.056
Oh, boy.

06:14.947 --> 06:16.794
Let's go.

06:19.852 --> 06:23.400
- Come on, let's get the fuck outta here.
- Alright, alright, I got it, I got it.

06:26.109 --> 06:29.212
Come on, the fuckin' tide
will take her, let's go.

06:30.996 --> 06:33.432
The fuckin' tide'll take her, come on.

06:33.532 --> 06:34.880
Let's go.

10:28.133 --> 10:30.414
A vodka.

10:32.538 --> 10:34.952
A glass. Fill it.

10:40.746 --> 10:43.048
Haven't seen you here before.
Are you new to the area or...

10:43.148 --> 10:45.177
Thank you.

13:10.307 --> 13:12.335
My child...

13:13.206 --> 13:15.422
did I not warn you?

13:16.867 --> 13:20.038
Should you, at any time,
take matters into your own hands,

13:20.138 --> 13:22.656
there will be severe consequences?

14:15.511 --> 14:17.357
Julia?

14:17.879 --> 14:18.847
Yes?

14:18.947 --> 14:22.329
I suppose you enjoyed
your impromptu little week off.

14:23.118 --> 14:24.920
Yes, thanks.

14:25.020 --> 14:28.066
You don't think some sort
of explanation's in order?

14:29.190 --> 14:31.960
There was a family crisis, I couldn't...

14:32.060 --> 14:36.400
Oh. Sorry, I didn't know, I had no idea.
Is everything alright?

14:36.500 --> 14:39.468
Excuse me, Dr. Lin? Yael Frankel?

14:39.568 --> 14:42.783
Yes, of course, Yael, come in.
Please, have a seat.

14:46.274 --> 14:48.112
So...

14:48.212 --> 14:49.711
I wanna look like her.

14:49.911 --> 14:52.426
Well, what's wrong with the way you look?

14:52.648 --> 14:57.201
If I have to wake up one more day
like this, I'm going to kill myself.

15:00.655 --> 15:03.392
Like clockwork.

15:03.492 --> 15:05.773
Lady Snowblood.

15:06.562 --> 15:09.409
You don't know who Lady Snowblood is.

15:11.967 --> 15:14.876
Born... for revenge.

15:19.691 --> 15:22.007
It's on the house.

15:40.061 --> 15:41.029
I'm not kidding.

15:41.129 --> 15:44.616
- You're not kidding about what?
- It's like she's on a fuckin' miracle drug.

15:45.366 --> 15:47.353
You'd think she had grown a dick.

15:47.453 --> 15:49.770
Whoa. Wait a second,
what does that even mean?

15:49.870 --> 15:52.974
- You gotta have a dick in order to feel good?
- All I'm saying is...

15:53.074 --> 15:55.476
the way she's strutting around,

15:55.576 --> 15:58.647
you'd think she strapped one on.
She's breakin' guy's balls all over.

15:58.747 --> 16:02.818
Yeah, cause only a big fuckin' dick
can break a set of balls.

16:02.918 --> 16:05.253
Who said anything about big fuckin' dicks?

16:05.353 --> 16:08.156
You gotta quit stuffin' socks
down your pants, bitch.

16:08.256 --> 16:10.759
No, no, no, fuck that.

16:11.309 --> 16:12.778
Homegirl was raped,

16:13.228 --> 16:17.265
and now she's pullin' herself together and
you gotta associate that with a fuckin' dick?

16:17.365 --> 16:20.201
- Fuck you.
- So, she is taking something?

16:20.301 --> 16:23.450
Or is this therapy thing for real?

16:24.300 --> 16:26.371
Load of ass, if you ask wanna ask me.

16:26.471 --> 16:28.848
Well, from what I understand...

16:29.148 --> 16:31.289
the therapy's quite unique.

16:31.689 --> 16:36.117
Vastov? He only takes
the most extreme cases.

16:36.217 --> 16:39.059
Sexual assault, rape...

16:40.051 --> 16:42.585
and the therapy itself...

16:42.685 --> 16:46.421
involves physically taking our power back

16:46.521 --> 16:49.044
from the ones who stole it.

16:50.465 --> 16:54.670
Seduction, blood, vengeance.

17:43.852 --> 17:45.754
Oh, sorry.

17:45.854 --> 17:47.325
Please.

17:47.925 --> 17:49.428
Treat yourself.

18:20.021 --> 18:21.847
I, uh...

18:22.347 --> 18:25.493
couldn't help overhearing you in the bar.

18:34.536 --> 18:36.417
The therapy.

18:39.941 --> 18:41.956
Is it real?

18:50.118 --> 18:52.220
I was raped.

19:35.897 --> 19:38.212
You're looking for me.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.947
Who are you?

19:41.737 --> 19:43.367
I'm Sadie.

19:45.206 --> 19:47.253
May I?

19:57.018 --> 19:58.838
Yeah.

19:59.538 --> 20:01.785
He'll like you.

20:03.608 --> 20:06.398
But tell me, did you go to the police?

20:08.296 --> 20:11.187
Did you report what happened to you?

20:15.470 --> 20:17.484
It's real.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.455
He can help you.

20:48.299 --> 20:51.139
That's why I need a dermatologist
to have them removed from my back.

20:51.239 --> 20:54.388
- And where is it?
- Right by my shoulder.

20:57.846 --> 21:00.227
Sorry, my shoulder blade.

22:05.180 --> 22:07.461
<i>There were four of them.</i>

22:11.753 --> 22:14.200
<i>The one, he...</i>

22:16.524 --> 22:19.539
<i>Dr. Malone, Piers...</i>

22:20.729 --> 22:23.510
<i>is on rotation in plastic surgery.</i>

22:24.565 --> 22:26.880
<i>He seemed so nice.</i>

22:27.869 --> 22:31.272
<i>That's the first time
anyone's been so nice to me.</i>

22:31.372 --> 22:33.308
You like that huh?

22:33.408 --> 22:36.690
Look at her fuckin' eyes, she's beautiful.

22:37.045 --> 22:39.180
Hey, in case ya hadn't figured it out...

22:39.630 --> 22:41.732
succinylcholine.

22:41.832 --> 22:44.369
She can feel all of it...

22:44.819 --> 22:47.250
but you can't move a muscle.

22:55.263 --> 22:57.144
Let me see that.

22:58.133 --> 22:59.154
No.

22:59.254 --> 23:01.104
Adam.

23:03.604 --> 23:05.419
Adam!

23:09.044 --> 23:10.922
Where'd you find her?

23:11.022 --> 23:13.214
- Where'd you find her?
- What difference does it make?

23:13.314 --> 23:17.252
- She's a fuckin' nurse.
- She's a goddamn whore!

23:17.352 --> 23:19.433
Fuck this.

23:21.122 --> 23:22.958
Fuck that tight ass fuckin' bitch,

23:23.058 --> 23:27.387
She ain't no fuckin' nurse, she's a fuckin'
whore. She's a fuckin' whore.

23:36.504 --> 23:38.535
Get in there.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.205
It's your turn.

23:51.824 --> 23:54.078
I said alright.

24:09.797 --> 24:11.999
That's it. That's it.

24:12.104 --> 24:15.827
Fuck her like you fucking mean it.
Fuck her like you fucking mean it.

24:31.089 --> 24:32.924
Julia.

24:50.974 --> 24:54.191
I understand you never went to the police.

24:57.715 --> 25:01.619
And... did you document any of this?

25:01.719 --> 25:03.766
The marks.

25:06.089 --> 25:08.370
Go to the hospital?

25:11.529 --> 25:13.743
May I ask why?

25:25.776 --> 25:28.293
I want those men to suffer.

25:31.382 --> 25:34.317
If personal revenge
is what you're after...

25:34.652 --> 25:37.300
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

25:38.689 --> 25:43.573
Making it personal will keep you
in a victim mindset...

25:44.062 --> 25:46.730
and will prevent you from healing.

25:46.830 --> 25:49.211
Julia. Julia.

25:49.733 --> 25:53.838
Please understand we will still tackle
the problem in the physical world.

25:54.638 --> 25:57.153
We will cut it at its root,

25:57.975 --> 26:01.779
but in a manner that helps you
transcend the ego

26:01.879 --> 26:06.018
and brings you true and lasting freedom,

26:06.118 --> 26:07.885
where I can assure you,

26:07.985 --> 26:11.589
no one will ever hold power
over you again.

26:19.363 --> 26:22.508
There are, however, some conditions
you should be aware of,

26:22.608 --> 26:25.336
in case you choose to proceed.

26:25.436 --> 26:29.852
You will need to give yourself over,
completely, to my methods,

26:30.674 --> 26:34.107
and should you, at any time,
take matters into your own hands,

26:34.207 --> 26:38.295
you must realize
there will be severe consequences.

26:39.850 --> 26:42.064
Do you understand?

27:44.482 --> 27:46.796
Your training starts now.

28:04.067 --> 28:05.915
Sit.

28:07.070 --> 28:09.680
You wanna be a little girl
your whole life?

28:11.174 --> 28:13.189
Sit down.

28:32.530 --> 28:34.911
You got contacts, I hope.

28:35.866 --> 28:38.414
They weren't prescription.

28:55.986 --> 28:58.334
Don't be mistaken.

29:00.090 --> 29:03.005
You are perfect as you are.

29:05.062 --> 29:06.809
We all are.

29:08.599 --> 29:10.435
But to lure them...

29:11.535 --> 29:14.380
we play society's little game.

29:18.175 --> 29:20.456
Painted face...

29:21.912 --> 29:23.772
mask...

29:24.607 --> 29:26.883
complete denial...

29:27.985 --> 29:30.433
of our creatureliness.

29:32.956 --> 29:34.892
You're stunning.

29:34.992 --> 29:37.340
You don't need me to tell you that.

30:26.043 --> 30:29.347
We want the ones who think
the world revolves around them.

30:29.847 --> 30:34.162
Their bank accounts,
their puny little dicks.

30:35.352 --> 30:37.800
The pseudo-macho corporate types who...

30:41.424 --> 30:44.477
pop Viagra pills on the sly.

30:46.630 --> 30:49.733
We want the ones with their lady friends.

30:49.833 --> 30:52.614
See, they'll follow without letting on.

30:54.972 --> 30:56.569
Now listen,

30:56.669 --> 31:00.143
no one can see you make your move.

31:00.243 --> 31:03.039
When you exit, you exit alone.

31:04.447 --> 31:06.383
Observe.

31:45.305 --> 31:46.886
Wait for it.

31:48.058 --> 31:50.327
Wait for it.

31:58.902 --> 32:00.837
Now.

32:00.937 --> 32:04.341
Usually, we make them follow us outside...

32:05.642 --> 32:08.035
but just for show.

32:53.156 --> 32:55.237
Shot of vodka.

32:56.459 --> 32:59.909
I can get that for ya.
Make that two shots.

33:12.710 --> 33:15.896
Hey, so, what's your name?

33:16.479 --> 33:18.260
Okay.

33:22.620 --> 33:25.523
Look, you don't wanna talk to him.

33:25.623 --> 33:28.776
You don't want any direct contact.

33:28.876 --> 33:31.736
People see you together,
you become a liability.

33:35.498 --> 33:38.477
And you don't walk right up next to him.

34:25.181 --> 34:26.962
Hey.

34:50.139 --> 34:52.475
You little slut.

34:52.574 --> 34:55.091
You wanna piece of this guy, huh?

35:16.533 --> 35:19.169
Sick bastard!

35:19.269 --> 35:22.405
Fuck you, what the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

35:22.505 --> 35:24.041
I didn't do nothin', I swear.

35:24.141 --> 35:26.977
- I saw you!
- It's nothin', baby, please.

35:50.868 --> 35:53.749
<i>She would stand there watching...</i>

35:55.305 --> 35:59.288
<i>as the pig breathed down on me...</i>

36:01.411 --> 36:03.793
and it was my fault.

36:05.315 --> 36:07.830
He wanted me more than her.

36:10.353 --> 36:12.634
His own wife?

36:14.925 --> 36:17.339
My mother.

36:21.698 --> 36:24.465
She's the one who told everyone.

36:26.003 --> 36:29.785
Friends, school.

36:32.275 --> 36:34.839
Julia is a whore.

36:34.939 --> 36:37.393
Julia is a whore.

36:38.115 --> 36:40.329
Julia is a whore.

36:42.119 --> 36:45.249
Was that the first time you cut yourself?

36:50.894 --> 36:53.775
- You never thought to...
- Kill myself?

36:57.067 --> 36:59.348
But I didn't.

37:03.040 --> 37:06.622
And it wasn't out of... fear.

37:09.546 --> 37:12.060
It was something else.

37:14.551 --> 37:16.932
It's like I...

37:18.155 --> 37:20.536
it's like I knew...

37:22.859 --> 37:27.026
I was meant for something, something...

37:29.967 --> 37:31.781
majestic.

38:34.231 --> 38:38.168
<i>The next stage of your therapy
will be recorded.</i>

38:38.268 --> 38:42.539
<i>In part, so we don't lose sight
of the clinical nature</i>

38:42.639 --> 38:44.853
<i>of the proceedings,</i>

38:46.009 --> 38:48.924
<i>but also for insurance purposes.</i>

38:52.515 --> 38:54.818
Some patients, they...

38:55.218 --> 38:57.966
struggle with the ramifications.

39:01.358 --> 39:05.144
You'll forgive me for not going
into more detail at this time...

39:06.596 --> 39:10.011
but don't worry.

39:11.434 --> 39:14.219
Sadie will be there to guide you.

39:17.607 --> 39:20.789
- Good.
- There is one other thing.

39:22.145 --> 39:23.992
Yes?

39:24.447 --> 39:26.728
I saw one of them.

39:28.418 --> 39:30.231
Adam.

39:34.791 --> 39:37.326
<i>I think he was looking for me.</i>

39:40.063 --> 39:42.479
<i>What do you think he wants?</i>

39:46.303 --> 39:48.384
<i>Forgiveness.</i>

39:52.042 --> 39:54.556
<i>How does that make you feel?</i>

40:00.983 --> 40:03.987
Julia? Fantasizing about the past,

40:04.087 --> 40:08.996
blaming others for what's happened to you,
goes against what we're doing here.

40:11.894 --> 40:16.049
It is imperative
that you not make it personal.

40:20.270 --> 40:23.565
I can only say that would be
a very dangerous path.

40:24.174 --> 40:26.455
Are we clear on this?

44:56.746 --> 44:59.243
Close the door, there's a draft.

45:07.557 --> 45:11.626
What are you, like...
Cinderella or something?

45:34.984 --> 45:37.065
Come to me.

45:59.876 --> 46:02.223
I want you inside me.

47:47.923 --> 47:50.805
Oh... Oh, my God, I'm gonna cum.

47:52.828 --> 47:55.261
Oh, wait, I'm gonna cum.

48:03.306 --> 48:05.608
Oh, shit, I'm gonna cum.

48:07.086 --> 48:10.112
What the fuck? Oh, my God! What the fuck?

52:08.476 --> 52:10.645
Why don't we go ahead
and cut it out right now?

52:10.745 --> 52:13.682
- Sorry, I should've...
- Yeah, nice of you to join us, Julia.

52:14.849 --> 52:18.399
Here just in time to help remove a mole
from Mr. Gordon's back.

52:26.694 --> 52:28.509
Julia.

52:29.764 --> 52:31.499
Julia.

52:31.799 --> 52:33.628
Scrub up.

53:14.942 --> 53:18.158
She ain't no fuckin' nurse, she's a fuckin'
whore. She's a fucking whore.

53:23.249 --> 53:24.651
Okay.

53:24.751 --> 53:27.988
Easy as pie.

53:28.088 --> 53:32.141
Now Julia will see to it that you're
left without so much as a scar.

56:26.466 --> 56:28.280
Adam.

56:28.835 --> 56:30.450
It's Julia.

56:38.479 --> 56:41.448
- Julia, are you there?
- <i>Yes.</i>

56:41.948 --> 56:45.638
- Fuck, I can't believe it's you.
- <i>I know.</i>

56:46.653 --> 56:50.423
<i>I really wanted to talk to you.
I didn't mean to...</i>

56:50.523 --> 56:53.159
<i>show up at your office like that,
I just...</i>

56:53.259 --> 56:55.608
<i>I wasn't sure if you'd see me.</i>

56:56.763 --> 57:00.579
<i>Ever since that night,
I haven't stopped thinking about you.</i>

57:04.537 --> 57:08.721
Something... I don't know,
something in me changed.

57:11.111 --> 57:15.425
Is there a chance we could...
meet just to talk?

57:16.299 --> 57:18.080
<i>Please?</i>

57:25.826 --> 57:27.827
Fuck.

57:27.927 --> 57:29.775
Sorry.

57:45.445 --> 57:47.648
- What the fuck?
- What?

57:47.748 --> 57:49.694
What is this?

57:50.551 --> 57:53.086
- It's nothing.
- What the fuck?

57:53.186 --> 57:57.557
- It's just a little blood.
- So why is it all over your fucking coat?

57:57.657 --> 58:00.661
You can't go out on your own,
it doesn't work like that.

58:00.761 --> 58:03.008
Didn't he tell you?

58:07.200 --> 58:09.614
Julia, what did you?

58:10.671 --> 58:13.874
I work in a plastic surgeon's office.

58:14.074 --> 58:16.221
People bleed.

58:17.510 --> 58:21.360
So I missed a little, so what?

58:42.335 --> 58:44.616
Forgive me?

58:59.319 --> 59:02.055
I need you to listen to me.

59:02.455 --> 59:05.358
You're one of his children now.

59:05.758 --> 59:08.128
He'll look after you,

59:08.228 --> 59:11.510
but God forbid you go against him.

59:12.265 --> 59:15.114
You can't go against this man.

59:19.773 --> 59:21.808
Look at you.

59:21.908 --> 59:24.177
You don't understand.

59:24.277 --> 59:26.325
I've seen it.

59:27.731 --> 59:29.633
He takes everything.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.024
<i>When this is all over...</i>

01:00:12.058 --> 01:00:14.739
<i>I want us to get away.</i>

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:19.911
Just Julia and Sadie.

01:00:22.468 --> 01:00:25.350
Far, far away.

01:00:55.701 --> 01:00:58.022
Sadie, what are you doing?

01:01:11.685 --> 01:01:15.431
<i>The body of a 33 year-old man
was found brutally murdered</i>

01:01:15.531 --> 01:01:20.026
<i>in the early hours of the morning near
Brooklyn Sunset Park, Chinatown area.</i>

01:01:20.126 --> 01:01:22.995
<i>Police report states
that the victim, Marcus Ryan,</i>

01:01:23.095 --> 01:01:25.127
<i>a recent Harvard business school graduate,</i>

01:01:25.228 --> 01:01:28.719
<i>was found with over 90 knife wounds
to the head and torso,</i>

01:01:28.919 --> 01:01:32.322
<i>and in a startling addendum
to the already vicious attack,</i>

01:01:32.472 --> 01:01:35.741
<i>we have recently learned
that Ryan was also castrated.</i>

01:01:35.841 --> 01:01:38.444
<i>Police are currently scouring
surveillance video footage</i>

01:01:38.544 --> 01:01:40.380
<i>from the hours leading up to the murder,</i>

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.183
<i>but as of yet,
there are no leads or witnesses.</i>

01:01:43.483 --> 01:01:48.038
<i>Ryan was last seen at The Balcony bar
in Brooklyn's hip Williamsburg area,</i>

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:51.575
<i>when, at some point in the evening,
he was said to have simply disappeared.</i>

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:11.966
Hey.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.657
What am I gonna do with you?

01:03:47.139 --> 01:03:50.722
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

01:03:51.944 --> 01:03:54.859
Julia, what is going on with you?

01:03:56.382 --> 01:03:59.080
Ever since you were gone for that week...

01:04:07.126 --> 01:04:09.374
Dr. Lin?

01:04:13.966 --> 01:04:17.932
I want you to come see me
in my office before you go. Okay?

01:04:18.704 --> 01:04:22.024
- Yeah. Valerie.
- Would you mind taking a quick look?

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:24.364
Yeah, sure, sure.

01:05:33.413 --> 01:05:35.948
I thought you'd go to the cops.

01:05:36.048 --> 01:05:38.484
I thought, any day now.

01:05:39.084 --> 01:05:42.321
Then... when nothing happened...

01:05:43.689 --> 01:05:45.904
I had to find you.

01:05:52.432 --> 01:05:54.571
I was weak.

01:05:54.671 --> 01:05:57.081
I should have stopped them.

01:05:58.538 --> 01:06:00.599
Even if it...

01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:04.248
Sorry.

01:06:06.211 --> 01:06:09.193
Funny thing is, in a way...

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:14.082
it's the best thing that could have
ever happened to me.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.595
Up until then, I was...

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:21.005
hiding from the world.

01:06:23.796 --> 01:06:27.146
Suddenly, I was forced to look at myself.

01:06:29.302 --> 01:06:32.344
Any notion that I had of myself...

01:06:32.444 --> 01:06:34.540
as a woman...

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.554
a victim...

01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:41.504
soft, defenseless.

01:06:44.517 --> 01:06:46.765
It vanished.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.355
You are not like them.

01:07:13.078 --> 01:07:15.359
I saw that.

01:07:15.915 --> 01:07:18.697
I saw what they did to you.

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:27.472
Julia, I'll do anything for you.

01:07:28.027 --> 01:07:30.274
Whatever you say.

01:07:36.536 --> 01:07:39.117
Actually there is something.

01:07:43.308 --> 01:07:46.979
I think it would be good for me
to see the other two...

01:07:47.079 --> 01:07:49.360
from that night.

01:07:51.083 --> 01:07:54.398
Well, not Piers.

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:59.103
I think I need more time for him.

01:08:00.293 --> 01:08:02.727
But the other two.

01:08:05.798 --> 01:08:08.012
I think it would...

01:08:08.831 --> 01:08:10.903
really help.

01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:15.119
Help me heal.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.381
Be right back.

01:09:07.192 --> 01:09:09.207
Love.

01:09:10.863 --> 01:09:12.743
Weakness.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:21.474
What did you think, the two of you
were going to run away together

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:23.921
and live happily ever after?

01:09:29.982 --> 01:09:32.384
You will go to her apartment,

01:09:32.484 --> 01:09:35.607
and see what you can find on a certain...

01:09:35.707 --> 01:09:37.725
Adam.

01:09:46.999 --> 01:09:49.212
Thank you, Sadie.

01:09:58.411 --> 01:10:01.231
I need you to watch this Piers Malone...

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:07.015
because something is going to happen
with him and my patient.

01:12:10.075 --> 01:12:14.258
Shotty, shotty, shot. Here.
This scotch is for you.

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:36.431
Vodka.

01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:25.189
Whoo!

01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:27.680
Yes, yes!

01:14:30.182 --> 01:14:32.618
You fuckin' cheatin' faggot.

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:35.321
We're gonna have
to take care of this later.

01:14:35.821 --> 01:14:38.035
I'll get these.

01:14:53.973 --> 01:14:56.976
Hey, Julia, you gotta get over here,
I got something to show ya real quick.

01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:59.350
Save some, save some.

01:15:10.355 --> 01:15:12.903
Oh, my God. Look at this...

01:15:20.299 --> 01:15:23.135
Welcome to my special service.

01:15:23.235 --> 01:15:25.070
- Special service.
- Thank you.

01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:26.872
Cheers.

01:15:43.455 --> 01:15:45.240
You with us kid?

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:48.460
- Yo, make some for all of us.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:16:23.362 --> 01:16:25.576
What the fuck?

01:16:35.941 --> 01:16:38.356
What the fuck?

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:19.359
But I thought I saved...

01:19:37.957 --> 01:19:40.384
This way I know,

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:43.413
you will never stand by and watch.

01:19:44.429 --> 01:19:47.254
Ever, ever again.

01:21:00.839 --> 01:21:03.241
She cut out...

01:21:03.341 --> 01:21:06.048
She cut out my fuckin' eyes!

01:21:12.351 --> 01:21:14.464
My fuckin' eyes.

01:21:15.187 --> 01:21:17.732
Who the fuck are you?

01:21:18.923 --> 01:21:22.160
- Where's Julia?
- Bitch, fuck you!

01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:28.478
Where's Julia?

01:21:29.033 --> 01:21:31.070
Where is she?

01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:35.006
Piers, Piers, she went for Piers.
We sent a message to hang out.

01:21:35.106 --> 01:21:38.677
I helped her! God, please, help me.

01:21:38.777 --> 01:21:41.250
My fucking eyes.

01:21:42.747 --> 01:21:44.583
It was you.

01:21:44.683 --> 01:21:47.585
In the cafe, with Julia, that was you.

01:23:43.650 --> 01:23:46.920
Should you, at any time,
take matters into your own hands,

01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:49.501
there will be severe consequences.

01:23:53.359 --> 01:23:56.897
It is imperative
that you not make it personal.

01:24:27.693 --> 01:24:29.616
Get in there, get in there.

01:24:31.729 --> 01:24:34.411
It was your little girlfriend...

01:24:35.033 --> 01:24:37.515
sold you down the river.

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.479
When I was young...

01:25:24.579 --> 01:25:27.915
I liked to dress up
in my big sister's clothes,

01:25:29.253 --> 01:25:31.323
put on her makeup.

01:25:35.726 --> 01:25:37.787
But my father...

01:25:37.887 --> 01:25:41.476
he could never accept
that a child of his was not perfect.

01:25:47.905 --> 01:25:50.119
So he cut me.

01:26:02.086 --> 01:26:04.209
My child...

01:26:04.881 --> 01:26:07.234
did I not warn you?

01:26:24.442 --> 01:26:27.145
Sadie. She's downstairs.

01:26:27.245 --> 01:26:29.680
Tell her we've been expecting her.

01:26:38.122 --> 01:26:40.458
We'll wait for her,

01:26:40.558 --> 01:26:43.381
and then we will continue this festival.

01:27:23.934 --> 01:27:25.748
Sadie.

01:27:36.847 --> 01:27:38.761
Nadya!

01:27:52.163 --> 01:27:53.976
Sadie?

01:28:18.189 --> 01:28:20.991
Did you think you could fuck with me?

01:28:21.091 --> 01:28:23.162
Fucking answer...

01:28:34.004 --> 01:28:35.773
But...

01:28:36.273 --> 01:28:38.487
my child.

01:29:06.604 --> 01:29:09.044
I think we should get outta here.

01:29:27.658 --> 01:29:29.906
What are you doing?
