00:01.936 --> 00:03.836
(theme music)

00:21.022 --> 00:23.354
(mysterious music)

00:37.438 --> 00:38.470
(â™ª)

00:53.754 --> 00:55.654
- Enjoying yourself?
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.689
Good bunch of lads.
- Oh! Excuse me boys.

00:57.691 --> 00:58.957
(chuckles)

00:58.993 --> 01:00.959
The little fellow on the couch
even likes footie.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.027
- Oh! Footie? Sounds intriguing.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.696
Perhaps you could teach me.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.833
So do you have a place to stay
while you visit our fair city?

01:07.968 --> 01:09.635
- Uh, could I have a moment?

01:10.838 --> 01:11.936
- Cheeky.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.239
- Didn't want things to get
awkward.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.707
- It wouldn't.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.910
I don't bat for your team
and, anyway, I'm a married man.

01:18.546 --> 01:19.578
- Mm, so was I.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.114
Man to man, I... I need to know,

01:23.150 --> 01:25.984
Am I going to be able to keep
my son, samuel?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.454
- It will be difficult
if the police get involved.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.856
- Difficult?
- You'll lose him.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.492
His mother's parents
have claim.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.862
- He's my child.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.296
- They'll show you're not fit.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.666
- I'm his father.
- I know.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.069
But the police won't care.

01:44.538 --> 01:45.404
(scoffs)

01:46.540 --> 01:48.840
- I build a life in toronto
and I lose it.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.075
How is that just?

01:57.551 --> 02:00.818
- He was dead when I buried him.
I don't understand.

02:00.855 --> 02:03.221
- Apparently, he wasn't!
- He was dead.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.756
You said so yourself!

02:04.792 --> 02:06.224
- Well, it appears,
in this case,

02:06.360 --> 02:08.026
You were not the only one wrong.

02:08.062 --> 02:09.428
- We should go to the police.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.563
- And what do you intend
to tell them?

02:11.599 --> 02:13.832
That the man you tried to kill
is after us?

02:13.901 --> 02:15.567
We cannot do that.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.135
- Oh, lord.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.037
I'm sorry.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.239
I did it for you.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.242
- I know, arthur.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.842
And I love you for it.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.180
But the police will not solve
the problem of maurice for us.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.284
(soft music)

02:45.399 --> 02:47.065
(glass shattering)

02:47.101 --> 02:48.066
(sighs)

02:48.068 --> 02:49.201
- Oh!

02:49.670 --> 02:51.469
(sighs)

02:52.072 --> 02:53.605
(knocking)

02:53.740 --> 02:55.607
- Open up. I'm not going away,
george.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.008
I know you're in there.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.813
- Henry, I appreciate
your concern

03:01.949 --> 03:04.082
But I'm not in the mood
for consolation.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.484
(henry): I'm not here to
console you.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.286
I have something you want
to hear,

03:07.421 --> 03:10.088
Discovered something suspicious
about your aunt chrysanthemum.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.891
(intense music)

03:19.700 --> 03:21.500
(henry): Your aunt was charged
with two counts of fraud

03:21.635 --> 03:22.968
In st. John's
in the last five years.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.304
- Well, that's not surprising,
higgins.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.039
None of my aunts are angels.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.773
- I know that, george.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.808
- How did you find this out?

03:31.779 --> 03:33.511
- Effie inquired with
a legal firm.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.046
They provided the information.

03:36.483 --> 03:37.583
- Effie's involved?

03:37.718 --> 03:38.950
- What did I just say?

03:39.653 --> 03:42.721
- So, she still cares?

03:43.524 --> 03:45.724
- Surprisingly, yes.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.795
- Uh, so what shenanigans
was aunt chrysanthemum up to
this time?

03:50.831 --> 03:53.465
- The charges also involved
your aunt oleander.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.068
Do you want to know what
I think?

03:56.070 --> 03:58.604
- I sure do. You've been
coming up sixes so far.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.006
- There may be a reason,
other than your bride's demise,

04:02.042 --> 04:03.608
Why your aunt chrysanthemum
and oleander

04:03.677 --> 04:04.876
Don't want you to marry.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.279
And that reason may be
nefarious.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.481
- So, what do we do?

04:09.483 --> 04:11.883
- Well, we need to figure out
what they're up to.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.486
And to do that,
we need some help.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.890
(murdoch): "those who dwelt
in the east,

04:18.959 --> 04:21.693
And the west were, indeed,
wicked witches;

04:21.729 --> 04:23.762
But now that you have killed
one of them,

04:23.764 --> 04:28.834
There is but one wicked witch
in all the land of oz,

04:28.836 --> 04:32.070
The one who lives in the west."

04:32.906 --> 04:34.972
That's not actually true.

04:35.009 --> 04:38.476
Witches are not real,
not in this world.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.479
Despite what your uncle
george crabtree might think.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.849
(julia): William, no need
to stifle her imagination.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.185
- Oh, I thought you'd be pleased
I'm no longer reading to her

04:47.221 --> 04:49.721
From the periodic table
of the elements.

04:49.723 --> 04:50.989
(julia): Coming to bed?

04:51.725 --> 04:53.191
- Um... Not quite yet.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.926
It seems my current
investigation

04:54.928 --> 04:57.862
Has me tied to mrs. Hart.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.331
(julia): Speaking of witches.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.432
(chuckles)
- julia!

05:04.204 --> 05:05.570
Here we are.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.973
Good night, susannah.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.342
Night.

05:12.946 --> 05:13.878
(sighs)

05:15.182 --> 05:16.948
- Do you want to know about
maurice majors?

05:18.085 --> 05:19.484
- If you're truthful.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.819
(brackenreid): Hm.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.587
I've drunk enough to be
truthful.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.559
For starters,
I did not kill him.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.194
In fact, might not even
be dead.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.230
- What are you talking about?

05:32.366 --> 05:33.798
- That's not the point
right now.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.768
An empty glass,
now that's the point.

05:36.804 --> 05:37.803
- Hm.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.274
- Mr. Majors had me bang
to rights

05:42.409 --> 05:43.641
For a crime that I committed.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.410
It was years...

05:45.545 --> 05:47.678
Years ago,
but a crime nonetheless.

05:50.650 --> 05:51.917
Ooh, wine.
- Mm.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.853
Back to you and mr. Majors.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.489
- Majors was a known accomplice
of a man named walter milton.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.659
Now, he was a piece of work.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.862
I knew him to be responsible for
the death of two working girls,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.063
But I couldn't prove it.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.866
- And I doubt anyone cared much
about their death.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.334
- No, they did not.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.169
But I did.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.537
I had a friendship with them.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.939
And, no, not like that.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.676
Anyway, I caught a break.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.411
An associate of milton's
was killed.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.081
I found evidence that put milton
at the scene of the murder.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.584
So I brought him in and
charged him.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.855
- And how did this become
a problem for mr. Majors?

06:32.159 --> 06:34.625
- Majors produced a sworn
statement that said he was...

06:34.661 --> 06:36.961
He was with milton at the time
of the murder.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.431
I destroyed it.

06:39.433 --> 06:42.266
- But milton did kill
his associate?

06:43.003 --> 06:44.703
- No, he did not.
- Ah.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.538
- But he did kill the two women.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.242
Majors pleaded
for milton's innocence,

06:50.377 --> 06:51.843
Accused me of all manner
of things.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.745
- Some of them true,
but no one believed him.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.049
- No one would take the word
of a black man

06:58.051 --> 06:59.584
Over that of an honest copper.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.786
- And you were the honest
copper?

07:02.556 --> 07:04.055
- And an englishman to boot.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.089
Fair play and all that.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.628
I was seeking justice for
the two dead women

07:09.630 --> 07:11.529
And all the others that were
unfortunate enough

07:11.598 --> 07:12.997
To cross milton's path.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.732
- You broke the law,

07:14.768 --> 07:17.002
Stopped a man from saving
his friend's life.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.604
- And more than likely
saved the lives of many others.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.874
It wasn't noble,
but it had to be done.

07:24.744 --> 07:26.110
What? You don't believe me?

07:27.113 --> 07:28.880
- I have a man
in this very building

07:28.882 --> 07:31.282
Afraid to go to the police
because the police here

07:31.318 --> 07:33.184
Don't follow the law
and instead

07:33.220 --> 07:34.752
Do whatever they think is right.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.154
Should we not be held
to a higher standard

07:37.191 --> 07:39.557
Than those honest coppers?

07:40.827 --> 07:42.427
- Oh, I don't know, watts.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.697
All I know is I took
a murderer off the street.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.366
On my word,

07:48.435 --> 07:52.037
I had nothing to do
with the possible demise
of maurice majors.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.308
- And you think violet hart
is behind all this?

07:57.344 --> 07:58.376
- She could be.

07:58.445 --> 07:59.844
- And behind what, exactly?

07:59.913 --> 08:01.913
What crime did she possibly
commit?

08:01.982 --> 08:04.115
- She authorized the shipment
of a coffin

08:04.184 --> 08:06.851
Said to contain her
father's body to new york city.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.186
That coffin had no body in it.

08:09.223 --> 08:11.056
- And you think he's behind

08:11.058 --> 08:12.790
These two murders at
the graveyard?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.993
- I don't know that,
but he is a suspect.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.528
- If he's still alive.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.195
And you want me
to question her?

08:18.232 --> 08:20.865
- No, I'd like you to be there
when I question her.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.000
- Oh!

08:23.303 --> 08:24.635
(hart): There's no reason
to believe

08:24.671 --> 08:26.471
My father's body was not
in the coffin.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.673
- Except for the fact that
it wasn't.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.276
Inspector brackenreid
has confirmed this himself.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.343
- He's confirmed nothing.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.680
Someone could have easily
tampered with the body during
transport.

08:35.815 --> 08:37.082
- And who would do that?

08:37.217 --> 08:38.583
- I must say I don't know.

08:38.718 --> 08:40.886
- Everything appears to be
in order.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.822
- The fact remains
that the man is not dead.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.691
- I examined him.
I declared a cause of death.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.825
It's all right there.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.161
- Perhaps you made a mistake?
It does happen.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.430
You were distraught.
He was your father.

08:52.499 --> 08:53.765
Perhaps you overlooked
something?

08:53.767 --> 08:57.035
- I was not distraught.
I didn't even care for the man.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.170
The only thing
that has happened here

08:59.306 --> 09:01.172
Is a dead man's body has gone
missing.

09:01.174 --> 09:04.643
- I don't think that that
is all that has happened here.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.111
- Oh, no, of course.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.513
I've pronounced my father dead

09:08.515 --> 09:10.014
And then had him buried alive.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.617
Is that the sort of thing
you would think me capable of?

09:12.753 --> 09:15.987
- Mrs. Hart, I don't think
we have begun to explore

09:16.122 --> 09:18.456
The depths of what you are
capable of.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.393
- We're not accusing you
of anything nefarious here.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.695
- You may not be, doctor ogden,
but your husband certainly is.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.898
- I would like to take
your report with me.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.501
- Of course.

09:29.503 --> 09:31.603
My father's death is a matter
of public record.

09:31.605 --> 09:32.804
You are welcome to it.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.139
- Observations?

09:35.208 --> 09:38.410
- She's hiding something.
- My thoughts exactly.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.478
- Impossible to prove without
a body.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.879
- I believe there is a body.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.148
I believe it to be alive and
I intend to prove it.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.552
- I should get back to
the clinic.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.621
Hopefully, my patient is
still there.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.756
- Oh, yes. If you need
any help...

09:53.126 --> 09:54.025
- Of course.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.429
Although, I think you might be
the one who needs it.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.965
(â™ª)

10:05.639 --> 10:07.304
I'd like you to stay
another day.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.573
- My husband needs me at home.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.911
- Yes and your body needs
to rest.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.913
- I simply stumbled and fell.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.148
I will be fine.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.251
- Why don't you tell me
the truth?

10:21.588 --> 10:22.586
- It is the truth.

10:25.191 --> 10:26.991
- I was a coroner for
many years.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.927
I've seen my fair share of
violent injuries.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.598
You didn't fall down the stairs.
Someone did this to you.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.834
- That is your word
against mine.

10:38.372 --> 10:40.604
- I also examined you closely.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.542
You were taken by force,
were you not?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.212
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.447
- Sexually.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.482
You were physically assaulted?

10:52.686 --> 10:54.886
- I'm going home.
- To the source of the problem?

10:55.956 --> 10:57.422
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.391
- You and I both know
what I'm talking about.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.496
- This matter is concluded.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.436
- There you are.
Let's have a look.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.272
Oh. It certainly looks
15 years older.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.308
Very good, irving.
Let's get this to the printer.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.711
I want it up all over the city
as soon as possible.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.182
(clears throat)

11:26.453 --> 11:27.452
- Hello, effie.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.920
- George.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.722
- Is it all right that I'm here?

11:32.058 --> 11:34.258
- We're trying to figure out
what your aunts are up to.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.793
You might as well be
a part of it.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.802
- I, uh... Jeez louise!

11:45.739 --> 11:47.471
- Ah, the reluctant
bridegroom.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.007
I'm only joking.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.476
Sit down.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.845
(crabtree): Why are you...
What... I...

11:53.980 --> 11:55.747
I can't help but wonder what
you're doing here.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.082
- What do you think I'm doing
here? I'm here to help.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.318
George, I must say,

12:02.422 --> 12:04.421
You come from a strangely
fascinating family.

12:08.194 --> 12:10.295
(bright): Violet.
- Miss bright.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.565
- Is it true?
- Is what true?

12:14.134 --> 12:15.299
- This?

12:16.035 --> 12:17.535
Is your father alive?

12:17.670 --> 12:18.903
- Of course not!

12:19.973 --> 12:21.639
Detective murdoch
has clearly lost his mind.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.307
- That doesn't seem likely.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.577
It seems more likely
that your father is alive

12:25.712 --> 12:27.845
And could very well be the one
who broke into our salon.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.614
- That is ridiculous.

12:29.616 --> 12:30.881
Why would you say that?

12:33.487 --> 12:35.319
- I found this behind
the cabinet

12:35.388 --> 12:36.787
Where we store the liquor.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.422
Isn't this the watch he was
showing off?

12:39.760 --> 12:41.392
I was going to give that
to the police.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.795
- I'll do that.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.263
Good day, miss bright.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.339
- That was my neighbour who
was robbed, he gave me a name.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.742
- You don't think you have more
pressing matters?

12:57.877 --> 12:59.878
Like a man trying to take
your friend's son away from him?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.346
- I understand that.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.616
But these people are
untrustworthy of the police.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.117
I'm going to give them
reason to reconsider that.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.689
(intriguing music)

13:16.763 --> 13:19.697
- Thanks for your help,
inspector.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.699
- Thought I'd lost you.

13:21.768 --> 13:24.102
- Well, I'm better than
you thought.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.570
- Go home, felding.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.839
- And burn a paycheque?
I think not.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.842
Nah, I'm going to return
this child to a decent home

13:30.977 --> 13:32.310
And you're going to help me.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.510
- Not a chance.

13:34.113 --> 13:35.313
- You think so?

13:36.183 --> 13:38.416
Oh, look there. Mm-hmm.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.018
See, this sure don't look

13:41.087 --> 13:43.387
Like the policeman's ball
to me, does it?

13:44.090 --> 13:45.456
- It's not as it seems.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.058
(chuckles)
- I know exactly how it seems.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.460
My question is:

13:49.462 --> 13:52.463
How long do you remain
on the police force

13:52.465 --> 13:54.565
If these get
into the wrong hands?

13:55.836 --> 13:57.802
Have a lovely day, inspector!

13:57.937 --> 13:59.470
(dramatic music)

14:08.682 --> 14:11.349
- I still can't believe the dog
came back to the graveyard.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.217
- That she did.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.020
Figured either she ran off
when her owner died,

14:16.155 --> 14:17.688
Or maybe the killer took her.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.858
Any luck?

14:19.993 --> 14:21.726
- Still none, I'm afraid.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.661
But, uh, thank you for
bringing her in.

14:23.697 --> 14:24.895
- Guess I'm keeping her now.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.534
I don't believe
the zombie story, you know?

14:31.571 --> 14:33.905
- Oh, good.
Then you're a sensible man.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.908
- Seen it twice before in
my life, you know?

14:36.910 --> 14:39.143
Men buried before their time.

14:39.145 --> 14:42.313
Tried to get a fellow out once,
but I was too late.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.583
Maybe this one got
a second chance at life.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.853
- This one was even featured
<i> the tribune.</i>

14:50.924 --> 14:52.756
Your aunt oleander predicted
a mine collapse.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.859
- Yes, I remember that.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.062
I was just a young lad.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.799
My aunts all raced over
to the mine

15:01.868 --> 15:03.867
And demanded the workers
all get out.

15:05.271 --> 15:08.138
Everybody thought they were mad
and then the mine filled in.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.207
- There were accounts
for over a month of rain.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.476
It was a coincidence!

15:11.478 --> 15:14.812
- If she didn't see it,
why would she say it?

15:14.848 --> 15:17.214
- People have premonitions
all the time, george.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.417
Sometimes they are right
and sometimes they are wrong.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.086
- Yes, but aunt oleander
is always right.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.689
She predicted when
my uncle lewis died at sea.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.024
She predicted that
when my aunt lily had a baby,

15:27.093 --> 15:28.892
He would be born with six toes.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.228
Hence, six-toed-simon.
You met simon!

15:31.264 --> 15:33.197
- He was lovely.
- Did you know he had six toes?

15:33.333 --> 15:35.499
- No.
- Well, my aunt oleander did!

15:35.568 --> 15:36.768
Even before he was born.

15:36.903 --> 15:39.370
- And I think this time
she is wrong.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.775
- So what do I do?
I... I go ahead and marry
effie...

15:44.844 --> 15:47.378
- Hardly your decision alone
now, george.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.781
- And say damn the consequences?
I can't do that.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.051
I couldn't live with myself if
it turned out my aunt was right!

15:54.120 --> 15:57.321
- All we're saying is that your
aunts might be up to something.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.189
- Yes! Trying to save your life!

16:05.065 --> 16:07.798
- Maybe george is right.
Maybe that's all it is.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.166
- We'll see.

16:11.371 --> 16:14.872
I've been in contact
with a lawyer who represents
george's family.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.941
He was an old professor
of mine.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.010
Somewhere in his files, he may
have an answer.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.913
- And what will compel him
to surrender those to you?

16:22.048 --> 16:24.615
- I may have told him that
I am now mrs. George crabtree

16:24.751 --> 16:26.517
And I am representing
my husband.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.352
If there's anything
pertinent,

16:28.355 --> 16:30.154
He will forward
the information to me.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.090
- Does george know
that you're doing this?

16:32.225 --> 16:33.458
- He does not, henry.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.993
- He might not like what
you're doing.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.895
- I don't care if he likes it
or not.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.832
George crabtree is not
the only wronged party here.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.835
- Henry, didn't you tell me
that george recently witnessed

16:44.904 --> 16:46.904
One of oleander's predictions
that came true?

16:46.973 --> 16:48.172
- That I did.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.107
- Perhaps you could find out
something

16:50.143 --> 16:51.909
About the circumstances
surrounding that?

16:53.046 --> 16:54.845
(mysterious music)

16:56.583 --> 16:58.649
(city hubbub)

16:58.718 --> 17:00.150
- Who brought these to you?

17:01.221 --> 17:03.420
- What's the matter?
You want them or not?

17:04.457 --> 17:05.857
- They were stolen
from a friend of mine.

17:05.859 --> 17:09.126
- Uh? Ah, I wouldn't know.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.062
- If you are not forthcoming,

17:11.131 --> 17:12.530
I will be forced to go
to the police.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.265
- Why don't you do that, huh?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.400
It was a policeman
who brought them here.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.901
(indistinct muttering)

17:27.080 --> 17:29.480
- Did you see mr. Majors
do this?

17:29.549 --> 17:32.816
- No. I believe he broke into
my establishment.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.219
Before he disappeared,

17:36.122 --> 17:37.888
He showed a keen interest
in it.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.091
- A keen interest?

17:40.226 --> 17:42.192
- He wanted to buy it out
from under me.

17:43.363 --> 17:46.663
- Oh and you believe
he's stealing from you now?

17:47.634 --> 17:49.433
- I think he's trying
to harass me.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.435
Scare me.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.637
Thing is he doesn't know me.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.138
I don't scare.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.643
- Do you have any proof of this?

17:59.512 --> 18:01.212
- I'm sure he was in the club.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.247
I found his pocket watch
behind the cabinet

18:03.283 --> 18:04.047
Where we store the liquor.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.416
- Oh!

18:06.019 --> 18:06.850
- Do you have it?

18:07.554 --> 18:08.719
- I gave it to mrs. Hart.

18:10.056 --> 18:12.256
She said she would make sure
it made its way to you.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.758
(â™ª)

18:16.830 --> 18:18.062
- Suppose you're right.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.963
- You don't really have
a choice.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.033
- You don't have a choice
about what?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.069
- We have to leave this city.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.570
With samuel.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.006
- I can stall this private
detective, buy you some time.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.075
- That's the solution?
We run?

18:31.210 --> 18:32.977
That's no answer.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.680
You know who ransacked
trevor's apartment?

18:35.682 --> 18:37.014
New york city police.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.850
What can we do about that?
Nothing.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.419
- If you run you can start
a new life.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.990
- Living on the run is not
a new life.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.426
It's not even a life.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.832
(â™ª)

18:58.437 --> 18:59.703
- Can I help you?

18:59.772 --> 19:02.806
- Mr. Prescott,
I'm dr. Julia ogden.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.343
- I am familiar with the name.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.011
- I treated your wife.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.846
I came to see how she's faring.

19:08.848 --> 19:11.114
- She is faring well.
Thank you very much.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.517
And she thanks you for
your assistance.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.520
- Uh, could I see her
for myself?

19:16.523 --> 19:17.654
- You cannot.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.592
- I'm a physician.
She's under my care.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.395
- And I am her husband,
and she is under mine.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.063
If you take another step,

19:26.065 --> 19:28.465
I shall have no choice but
to call the police.

19:29.736 --> 19:33.137
- Uh, it is I who should be
calling the police on you.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.271
- Don't be preposterous.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.174
Good day.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.509
(sombre music)

19:46.786 --> 19:47.951
- Mrs. Hart.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.087
- Detective.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.756
- When were you planning on
giving it to me?

19:53.960 --> 19:54.958
- Excuse me?

19:54.994 --> 19:56.360
- Your father's watch.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.963
The one he misplaced
while he was burglarizing

19:58.965 --> 20:00.330
Your partner's nightclub.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.932
- It is my nightclub, as well.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.534
He must have lost it there
back when he was still alive.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.905
- I see.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.375
But miss bright did want you
to give it to me, as evidence.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.577
- And I neglected to give it
to you promptly.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.778
My mistake.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.113
- Of course.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.384
Your report states that
your father's cause of death

20:20.386 --> 20:22.253
Was cerebral hemorrhaging.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.223
- Yes, I'm aware of that.
I wrote it.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.527
- It also notes that there were
significant traces of cocaine

20:29.529 --> 20:30.794
In his bloodstream.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.398
- Which I speculated may have
been the cause of the embolism.

20:35.701 --> 20:38.869
- It's quite easy for you
to obtain cocaine, is it not?

20:40.539 --> 20:43.307
- Despite the law, it is easy
for any number of people

20:43.442 --> 20:45.209
To get their hands
on cocaine.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.745
And, as I remember,
my father was a very heavy user.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.614
He often said it would be
the death of him.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.685
So, I guess george crabtree's
aunt isn't the only one

20:54.721 --> 20:56.620
With the ability
to foretell the future.

20:56.656 --> 20:57.755
- Yeah.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.001
- Do you need
any assistance, sir?

21:12.571 --> 21:14.438
- Not at this time, george.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.843
- I know you don't think
highly of my decision, sir,

21:18.978 --> 21:20.510
But I couldn't risk it.

21:20.546 --> 21:23.247
I couldn't risk
that my aunt was right.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.950
- You know my thoughts on this,
george.

21:28.254 --> 21:31.989
I'm very skeptical of seers
and psychics and the like.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.358
- Well, what would you do?

21:38.264 --> 21:41.465
- I'm not so sure that
I would be willing to risk

21:41.467 --> 21:43.534
Losing the chance at
being happy.

21:47.307 --> 21:48.905
- Sir, if you need any help.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.275
- If you truly want to help me,
george,

21:52.145 --> 21:53.811
Find me a dead man.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.746
(â™ª)

21:56.849 --> 21:58.248
- Are you sure?

21:58.284 --> 22:00.551
- The coach that george saw
run down that man

22:00.620 --> 22:02.420
Was hired by his aunt
chrysanthemum.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.954
- And you're sure
it's the same coach?

22:04.023 --> 22:05.556
- The owner claimed to have
found damages.

22:05.691 --> 22:07.190
They arranged the accident.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.359
- So those two are playing
a game.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.161
To what end?

22:11.898 --> 22:13.897
- Those witches!
- What?

22:13.933 --> 22:16.767
- I've just received a wire from
my old professor.

22:16.902 --> 22:18.035
- The lawyer.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.504
- Yes, the lawyer, henry.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.040
And now I know
why george cannot marry.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.542
At least not until tomorrow.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.110
- His birthday?

22:28.181 --> 22:30.147
- I think those two
deserve a good scare.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.983
Louise?
- Yes?

22:33.986 --> 22:35.585
- I have a favour to ask of you.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.192
Can we come in?

22:43.062 --> 22:44.494
- Yes, of course.

22:46.232 --> 22:47.764
- Charming.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.735
- Well, I haven't exactly been
at my best recently.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.737
- Well, that is about to change,
george.

22:53.773 --> 22:56.207
- How so?
- It's very simple, george.

22:57.276 --> 22:58.975
- You and I are going
to get married.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.412
(â™ª)

23:06.052 --> 23:07.685
- I'm delighted george.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.186
- Well, after the week
I've had,

23:09.321 --> 23:11.121
I think I deserve
a birthday party.

23:12.325 --> 23:13.891
And you've both come
all the way to toronto to...

23:13.893 --> 23:16.259
Save my bride's life.

23:16.962 --> 23:18.295
- I just did my duty.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.130
- And I thank you for that.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.233
- I'm sorry I had to tell you
the truth.

23:24.504 --> 23:27.204
- Yes, but in doing so,
you saved miss newsome's life.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.207
I mean it was her you saw in
your vision, wasn't it?

23:32.111 --> 23:33.577
- She was.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.812
- So you did the right thing,
didn't you?

23:36.849 --> 23:39.550
- Well, I will begin
arrangements.

23:39.685 --> 23:41.452
We will have a grand time,
george.

23:41.521 --> 23:44.388
Please feel free to bring
any of your friends.

23:45.391 --> 23:46.890
- Yes, I will do.

23:48.227 --> 23:51.495
Uh, thank you and I'll see
you both at the party tomorrow.

23:52.765 --> 23:56.200
(sighs)
- don't look so sour, oleander.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.504
- We are not doing
the right thing for him.

24:01.340 --> 24:02.540
He is a good man.

24:03.276 --> 24:04.275
He deserves to be happy.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.347
- You can't go
to the police about this.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.149
- Some of them are breaking
the law.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.284
- You'll just make this worse
for you and your kind.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.253
- My kind? What am I?
A different species?

24:16.255 --> 24:18.155
- Bloody hell, watts!
Get off your high horse

24:18.157 --> 24:20.024
And listen to me for one minute.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.359
I can help you
if you can help me.

24:23.463 --> 24:26.230
- Is that how one finds justice?
By making deals?

24:27.667 --> 24:29.233
- Do you want the police to stop
harassing your friends, or not?

24:29.936 --> 24:31.334
- I do.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.503
- And do you want jack to be
able to keep sam?

24:35.307 --> 24:36.973
Then let me handle the police.

24:38.043 --> 24:40.911
Right, I need you to go
to an apartment

24:41.046 --> 24:43.314
And when you see that
private investigator leave...

24:44.317 --> 24:45.249
- The men are still out looking,
sir,

24:45.384 --> 24:47.251
But there have been
no sightings or reports.

24:47.253 --> 24:50.321
- Mr. Majors is likely
long gone, if he has any sense.

24:50.456 --> 24:52.523
Have the men return to their
regular duties

24:52.525 --> 24:54.124
But keep an eye out.
- I will.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.127
Uh, sir, may I have
the afternoon off?

24:57.930 --> 24:59.196
- I suppose so.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.732
- George's aunts are throwing
a party. It's his birthday.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.267
- Is george up for this?

25:03.402 --> 25:05.402
- Oh, I think he is.

25:09.775 --> 25:12.743
- William, I think you should
arrest me for assault.

25:12.812 --> 25:15.079
- Oh! What have you done,
julia?

25:15.081 --> 25:17.614
- Alderman prescott has blocked
my access

25:17.650 --> 25:19.950
To all of the medical supply
houses in town.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.451
- How can he do that?

25:21.521 --> 25:23.954
- He told them that it was
in their best interest

25:24.023 --> 25:25.756
To not do business with me!

25:25.825 --> 25:29.159
I can get things from buffalo,
but it will take a long time!

25:29.161 --> 25:32.563
- Oh, julia, I should advise you
to steer well clear of him.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.230
- Oh, oh, I will.

25:34.267 --> 25:36.767
But he will soon be made
well aware

25:36.769 --> 25:38.636
Of just who he has taken on.

25:39.338 --> 25:40.837
- All right.

25:40.839 --> 25:42.339
- See you at home.
- Yes.

25:45.578 --> 25:47.111
- Mrs. Hart.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.913
- Doctor ogden.
Are you my next inquisitor?

25:49.982 --> 25:52.249
- Oh, I'm not here
about that.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.318
And if you made a mistake,
it was an honest one.

25:54.887 --> 25:55.853
- Thank you.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.657
- I need your access to get
these supplies.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.925
- If you can have them delivered
to the morgue,

26:01.928 --> 26:03.226
I can get them to the clinic.

26:03.996 --> 26:04.995
- Why can't you get those?

26:05.130 --> 26:08.465
- Someone in high places is
trying to punish me.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.867
And in doing so is punishing
women throughout the city.

26:10.869 --> 26:12.536
- Perhaps I could kill him.

26:13.472 --> 26:14.571
- Uh?

26:15.441 --> 26:17.007
- A joke, doctor ogden.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.442
Who is this someone?

26:20.346 --> 26:21.778
(sighs)
- an alderman prescott.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.782
- Adrian prescott?
- Yes.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.786
- One moment, I have something.
- Oh?

26:29.822 --> 26:32.522
- It's a ledger from a nightspot
that I'm part owner of.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.359
- Oh, yes! The star bright club.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.895
- I'm surprised
I haven't seen you there.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.298
- Well, I have had my hands full
a little lately.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.566
- Of course.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.968
My partner has been making
payments to mr. Prescott

26:45.004 --> 26:46.637
To ensure the place stays open.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.507
(scoffs)

26:50.509 --> 26:52.176
- He's been taking bribes?

26:53.045 --> 26:54.311
- He has, indeed.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.212
And I can give you
more information if you need.

26:56.716 --> 26:59.349
- Ha! Well,

27:00.019 --> 27:01.652
Thank you, mrs. Hart.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.254
(giggles)
thank you very much!

27:05.791 --> 27:07.724
(grady): Always a pleasure
to welcome a neighbour from
the north.

27:07.860 --> 27:08.993
How can I help you?

27:09.128 --> 27:11.195
- It's not a pleasant visit,
I'm afraid.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.796
It's been brought to
my attention

27:12.931 --> 27:14.398
That some of the men from
your precinct

27:14.467 --> 27:15.999
Have been indulging
in thievery.

27:16.002 --> 27:18.035
- I've received no such reports.

27:18.037 --> 27:20.003
- They've been too scared
to come forward.

27:20.072 --> 27:23.140
- Those fears are unfounded.
I run an honest precinct.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.474
- I don't think you do.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.078
- Who were these victims?

27:28.114 --> 27:30.014
- Residents of flats
in greenwich village.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.348
- Oh-ho! The lavender lollies

27:32.385 --> 27:33.750
Have got their knickers
in a twist.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.552
- They don't deserve to be
preyed upon

27:35.621 --> 27:37.421
By the new york police
department.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.089
- And I don't need some
canuck

27:39.091 --> 27:40.958
Telling me how to run
my precinct!

27:42.094 --> 27:44.094
- I may reside and work in
the frozen north,

27:44.229 --> 27:46.529
But I'm an englishman 100%,
paddy.

27:47.766 --> 27:50.300
Now, would you rather
theodore roosevelt told you?

27:51.170 --> 27:52.703
- What are you talking about?

27:52.838 --> 27:55.839
- The former president
and one time commissioner
of this very force.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.241
- Well, I know who he is.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.943
- Well, he's a good friend
of mine and he owes me a favour.

28:00.079 --> 28:02.846
Some of my men, canucks,
saved his life.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.483
Now he worked very hard
to combat corruption
on this force.

28:07.819 --> 28:09.253
I don't think he'd be pleased
with your stewardship.

28:10.589 --> 28:12.322
In fact, I would guess
you'd be in for a rough ride.

28:14.727 --> 28:15.992
- So what do you want?

28:16.028 --> 28:17.661
- I want any goods stolen

28:17.796 --> 28:19.263
From the residents
of greenwich village

28:19.398 --> 28:21.131
Returned to their rightful
owners.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.600
And any of your men
patrolling down there

28:23.669 --> 28:26.670
To act like policemen and
not criminals.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.739
- And mr. Roosevelt?

28:28.741 --> 28:31.374
- If you do what I ask,
he'll be none the wiser.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.079
- Then you have it.
- Good.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.282
Oh and, uh, one more thing.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.083
(sighs)

28:44.023 --> 28:45.922
- What is the meaning of this?
Huh?

28:46.892 --> 28:48.225
I've done nothing,
nothing wrong.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.095
- You are conducting
an unauthorized investigation

28:51.230 --> 28:53.429
In my precinct.
I want you out of here.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.300
- You know what this man is?

28:57.369 --> 28:59.102
Do you know what this man
is protecting?

28:59.105 --> 29:00.704
- Not my concern.

29:02.074 --> 29:05.708
- He is allowing two known
homosexuals to corrupt a child,

29:05.745 --> 29:09.946
A child two god-fearing people
have a legal claim to.

29:10.716 --> 29:12.182
- That is a canadian matter.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.517
It's not my concern.

29:13.586 --> 29:14.384
Go home.

29:15.554 --> 29:18.388
- Hey, your career is over.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.390
- Do your worst, felding.

29:20.392 --> 29:21.858
I'll be ready.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.794
- Yeah. We'll see, we'll see.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.533
- Your son is yours.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.734
- Thank you.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.671
And the private investigator?

29:34.673 --> 29:36.473
He's been sent back
to canada.

29:36.475 --> 29:37.373
He won't bother you again.

29:38.076 --> 29:39.542
- You hear that, samuel?

29:43.249 --> 29:44.414
(brackenreid): Did you get them?

29:44.483 --> 29:46.550
- I did.
Broke into someone's home

29:46.619 --> 29:48.152
Just like a regular policeman.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.088
- Is this all of them?
- All I could find.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.022
- What are those?

29:53.091 --> 29:55.124
- Photographs that could
ruin my career.

29:56.094 --> 29:57.294
- You risked a lot for us.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.261
Thank you.

30:00.432 --> 30:01.965
- It was the only way, watts.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.934
Now you two can live
the life you choose.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.043
- I told you to leave me alone.

30:13.178 --> 30:15.579
- Yes, I'm not one to listen,
mr. Prescott.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.114
This is detective
william murdoch.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.349
- I know damn well who he is.
What do you want?

30:19.418 --> 30:21.518
- You're under arrest,
mr. Prescott.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.720
- That's ridiculous.
On what charge?

30:23.789 --> 30:26.323
- Accepting bribes.
We have a number of witnesses

30:26.392 --> 30:28.191
Who've signed affidavits
to the fact.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.527
- I'm sure their word
means nothing.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.930
- That's why we're also looking
into your bank accounts.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
You see, money never lies.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.134
Please come with me.

30:38.704 --> 30:40.270
- I will not.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.674
- Then I will have no choice
but to instruct my constables

30:43.809 --> 30:45.542
To take you by force.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.345
That should be quite
a sight for your neighbours,
I'd imagine.

30:51.917 --> 30:54.350
(â™ª)

30:55.621 --> 30:56.820
- What are you doing?

30:57.823 --> 30:59.422
I told you I didn't--

31:00.593 --> 31:01.958
- This has nothing
to do with you, mrs. Prescott.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.626
Your husband is a criminal.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.896
And if you choose,
you're a free woman.

31:07.766 --> 31:09.233
(sighs)

31:14.240 --> 31:16.973
- I hope you have thanked
oleander for saving your life.

31:17.109 --> 31:18.675
- Oh, many times over.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.178
- And where is george?

31:22.214 --> 31:23.981
- Well, he said he would be
along shortly.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.249
He also said that he had
a surprise for the two of you.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.785
- Oh there's no need for that.
It is his birthday.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.654
- Well, I think he's just glad
I'm not dead!

31:30.656 --> 31:32.221
- Mm.
- As am I, of course.

31:32.825 --> 31:33.957
(crabtree): Ah!

31:34.026 --> 31:36.326
- Here he is!
- The man of the hour is here!

31:36.328 --> 31:37.627
- George!

31:38.597 --> 31:39.863
- Who's this?

31:39.932 --> 31:41.465
- Aunt chrysanthemum,
aunt oleander.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.300
I'd like to introduce you

31:43.369 --> 31:45.535
To my bride,
mrs. Louise cherry.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.070
- I'll be taking his name.

31:48.207 --> 31:49.238
- Bride?

31:49.275 --> 31:50.807
(crabtree): Yes,
married just this morning.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.542
- George and I were an item
at one time.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.744
- And I had vowed to be married
by this age.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.779
- And since effie was doomed
to die.

31:56.815 --> 31:59.082
- Well, I jumped at the chance
with louise, here.

32:00.853 --> 32:02.085
- But she's going to die.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.421
- No, she's not.

32:04.490 --> 32:07.157
It's miss newsome I saw
perish.

32:07.159 --> 32:09.158
- You didn't see anyone
perish.

32:09.194 --> 32:10.126
(scoffs)

32:10.195 --> 32:11.228
The only thing you saw perish

32:11.363 --> 32:12.596
Was her inheritance.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.765
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.434
- I spoke to mr. Penney.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.102
- Our lawyer.

32:19.104 --> 32:22.439
- Your aunt astrid was a very
unusual woman, was she not?

32:23.409 --> 32:25.075
George was to inherit
her fortune.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.577
That is unless he remained
a bachelor too long.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.379
- Then he would be deemed
to be useless

32:29.514 --> 32:31.581
And her inheritance would go
to you instead.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.585
- I will just leave.
- No, you will not.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.722
I'm so sorry, george.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.523
I would have confessed
to the fraudulence

32:40.559 --> 32:42.125
As soon as it were safe
to do so.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.260
- And as soon as she had
george's money.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.262
- Aunt chrys?

32:46.899 --> 32:48.264
Aunt lee-ann.

32:49.434 --> 32:52.736
- George, I am
in terrible trouble.

32:52.805 --> 32:55.538
I wouldn't have done this
unless I had to.

32:55.574 --> 32:58.975
- She's in debt to a loan shark,
a very bad man.

32:59.945 --> 33:01.878
It was the only way I could
help her.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.482
- But now that you are wed,
the money is all yours.

33:06.485 --> 33:07.950
Please, just let me run?

33:09.088 --> 33:11.120
Let me run and I will never
trouble you again.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.157
- And if I marry effie,
she won't die?

33:15.093 --> 33:16.760
- I cannot promise that,
but...

33:16.829 --> 33:18.795
It is not foretold.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.498
- But you are already married.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.768
- We just wanted to throw you
a little scare.

33:24.903 --> 33:26.102
You deserved that.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.174
(â™ª)

33:34.179 --> 33:37.647
- Trevor's coin collection
was returned with an apology.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.315
- Service with a smile.

33:39.385 --> 33:40.851
- So, is this what we do now?

33:40.986 --> 33:42.852
Make deals instead of follow
the law?

33:42.921 --> 33:44.588
- Oh, get over yourself, watts.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.190
I've heard you say many times
that the law is not justice,

33:47.325 --> 33:48.792
That the law
is not always right.

33:48.927 --> 33:51.194
- So, you change the law,
you don't break it.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.762
- I saved your friend's son.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.531
You're not going to make me
feel bad about that.

33:55.234 --> 33:56.466
And you should know,

33:56.502 --> 33:58.901
You're welcome back
in my station house anytime.

33:59.671 --> 34:01.271
Your choice.
- Thank you,

34:01.273 --> 34:04.074
But I don't know
if that's what I want anymore.

34:05.010 --> 34:08.211
I believe this belongs to you.

34:08.680 --> 34:09.345
(chuckles)

34:09.415 --> 34:10.413
- Thank you.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.149
That'll be a shame.

34:13.252 --> 34:14.818
The force could use more
good men like you.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.087
Good luck, watts.

34:22.961 --> 34:24.627
(soft music)

34:26.498 --> 34:27.697
- Thank you, william.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.300
It was a good thing we did
today.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.638
- What will happen to
mrs. Prescott?

34:34.773 --> 34:37.440
- I don't know.
But whatever it is,

34:37.509 --> 34:39.075
It will be of her choosing.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.176
- Hm.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.115
- And what of your case?

34:45.184 --> 34:47.117
- Remains unsolved, I'm afraid.

34:48.120 --> 34:50.653
I suspect mr. Majors has left
toronto.

34:50.689 --> 34:52.422
- But you still think
he's alive?

34:52.424 --> 34:54.657
- Well, I suspect as much.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.259
Mm?

34:56.394 --> 34:57.593
- And so what now?

34:58.396 --> 34:59.395
- Well, I can prove nothing.

35:00.866 --> 35:04.000
And I'm not quite sure
of mrs. Hart's involvement
in all this.

35:05.070 --> 35:07.403
But my case is at a dead end.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.804
- Are you giving up?

35:09.942 --> 35:11.875
- I can't just keep chasing
ghosts.

35:12.744 --> 35:15.011
But, sooner or later,

35:15.013 --> 35:18.514
Either mr. Majors or mrs. Hart
will reveal something.

35:19.485 --> 35:22.185
Until then, I'm biding my time.

35:23.422 --> 35:25.421
(baby crying)
- hm.

35:27.759 --> 35:29.092
- Where's the nanny?

35:32.498 --> 35:34.564
- So, you're going to turn them
both in?

35:35.967 --> 35:37.433
- They're my aunts, effie.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.768
They've had hard lives.

35:40.172 --> 35:43.306
And besides trying to fool me
and nearly ruining my life,

35:43.441 --> 35:44.841
They haven't done
anything wrong.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.442
- No.
- What?

35:46.478 --> 35:48.411
- You're going to give her
the money, aren't you?

35:49.248 --> 35:51.447
- She's in trouble.
- George!

35:51.517 --> 35:53.583
After all they put you through!

35:54.953 --> 35:56.920
Yes, of course.

35:58.190 --> 35:59.455
- Maybe we'll keep a little
something for the trip,

35:59.491 --> 36:01.324
But we don't need the money.

36:02.394 --> 36:03.593
- You and I,
or you and louise cherry?

36:03.595 --> 36:04.995
(chuckles)
- please.

36:06.431 --> 36:07.597
Come on.

36:14.472 --> 36:15.671
What do you think?

36:17.075 --> 36:19.075
I can't promise you won't drop
dead the minute you say, "yes."

36:20.946 --> 36:23.079
- I need to go home.
- What?

36:23.148 --> 36:25.148
- I paid a pretty penny for
that dress.

36:25.150 --> 36:26.515
It's going to be used.

36:35.493 --> 36:39.028
- I led that private
investigator to you.

36:40.165 --> 36:42.164
- He might have found samuel
and I anyway.

36:42.201 --> 36:43.733
- It won't stop.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.369
Misfortune follows us.

36:48.073 --> 36:50.707
You two will lead a more
peaceful life without me.

36:54.079 --> 36:55.244
- Are you leaving for good?

36:55.280 --> 36:56.946
- I don't know, jack.

36:59.784 --> 37:01.684
I'm not a happy man.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.457
I'm not happy with myself
and until I am,

37:07.459 --> 37:08.792
I shouldn't be here.

37:12.330 --> 37:14.064
- Where're you going to go?

37:15.734 --> 37:18.367
- That's something I don't have
the answer to yet, but...

37:21.607 --> 37:23.673
- My life won't stop
once you leave.

37:25.143 --> 37:26.542
- Nor should it.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.345
(babbling)

37:33.785 --> 37:35.985
(soft music)

37:37.022 --> 37:38.421
'til the next time.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.361
(â™ª)

37:49.301 --> 37:51.034
(hart): We need to find
my father.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.235
Detective murdoch
will find out he's alive

37:53.272 --> 37:55.905
And then he'll discover our role
in all of this.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.708
(man humming)

38:02.247 --> 38:04.313
- I best stay well hidden,
wouldn't you say?

38:04.349 --> 38:08.351
I'd hate for something ill
to fall upon my loving daughter.

38:10.856 --> 38:14.991
So, violet, take a seat and
we can have a nice family dinner

38:15.126 --> 38:17.060
And discuss
our current situation.

38:18.597 --> 38:19.995
Sit.

38:24.336 --> 38:26.069
Mm.

38:26.071 --> 38:28.471
Your husband has found excellent
suppliers.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.740
The fish could be
a little fresher, but uh,

38:30.809 --> 38:32.342
We do with the best
we can with

38:32.477 --> 38:34.477
What we're given in this world,
do we not?

38:35.146 --> 38:36.079
It's jambalaya.

38:36.081 --> 38:37.747
I learned how to make it
during my time

38:37.783 --> 38:39.415
Down in new orleans.

38:39.451 --> 38:42.051
That's a place where
you would prosper, violet.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.053
A city full of fraudsters.

38:46.024 --> 38:48.825
It's made from as many
ingredients as you'd like.

38:50.062 --> 38:52.095
A... A multitude
of different tastes,

38:52.230 --> 38:55.231
Some bold, some almost
imperceptible.

38:56.301 --> 38:57.900
You can't even tell
what you're ingesting.

38:59.604 --> 39:02.038
Not like that speedball
you gave me, arthur.

39:02.107 --> 39:03.106
(exclaiming)

39:04.142 --> 39:05.775
That almost took me off
this earth.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.245
Try some.

39:12.617 --> 39:15.385
I learned some things
from a voodoo woman down there.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.053
Oh, she was something.

39:18.357 --> 39:20.857
She taught me how to put myself
in a trance so deep

39:23.729 --> 39:26.662
It was hard to tell
if I was dead or alive.

39:27.732 --> 39:29.365
But you know that now,
don't you, violet?

39:33.605 --> 39:34.837
You don't like it?

39:35.940 --> 39:37.941
- I don't have much of
an appetite.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.946
- I would have thought
you'd have chosen a better man.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.380
- Now see here!
- Don't.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.216
I'm already embarrassed
for you.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.488
How about you, violet?

39:53.959 --> 39:56.292
You always had such an appetite
when you were young.

39:57.129 --> 39:59.028
I made this special for you.

40:04.569 --> 40:07.837
You think I'd do the same to you
that you did to me?

40:08.774 --> 40:10.873
I would never be so
lily-livered.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.182
Mm!

40:20.152 --> 40:22.318
Delicious, if I do say
so myself.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.488
You two don't know
what you're missing.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.265
Good.

40:38.170 --> 40:41.203
It's important that we establish
some trust while I'm here.

40:42.574 --> 40:45.341
- I can give you money?
Any... Anything you want.

40:45.343 --> 40:48.577
Just... Just leave.

40:49.381 --> 40:51.080
- Oh, I'm staying for a while.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.149
I'm interested in seeing
how much crime

40:53.284 --> 40:55.218
A dead man could get away with.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.419
- Detective murdoch
suspects you're still alive.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.288
- Then he best not find me,
then.

40:59.891 --> 41:00.957
'cause if he does,

41:01.092 --> 41:04.227
Both you and your spineless
husband go down with me.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.163
Bon appÃ©tit.

41:08.032 --> 41:09.164
Eat up now.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.701
Been losing weight lately,
I hear.

41:11.770 --> 41:14.136
Mm-mm-mm! Yes!

41:18.977 --> 41:20.209
- Here it is, henry.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.511
- Crabtree? You're late.

41:22.547 --> 41:24.280
Your shift started
two hours ago.

41:24.415 --> 41:25.949
- Sorry, sir.
- I'll be docking your pay.

41:25.951 --> 41:27.717
- Well, that sounds more
than reasonable.

41:27.852 --> 41:29.352
I was attending
to something very important.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.920
- It couldn't wait
a moment longer.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.522
- Gentlemen,
it's been a while coming,

41:32.524 --> 41:34.523
But I would like to introduce
you to my wife,

41:34.559 --> 41:35.925
Mrs. Effie crabtree.

41:36.060 --> 41:39.194
- I'll see he makes it
to work on time in the future,
inspector.

41:39.231 --> 41:41.230
(laughter, applause)

41:41.233 --> 41:43.933
- Congratulations, george.
- Ah, thank you, sir. Thank you.

41:43.969 --> 41:45.668
- Congratulations,
you little bugalugs.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.537
(indistinct chatter)

41:47.539 --> 41:50.205
(murdoch): Wonderful! Wonderful!
You must come for dinner.

41:50.242 --> 41:52.008
(indistinct chatter)

41:53.879 --> 41:56.679
- Oh! This must be a special
occasion

41:56.681 --> 41:59.048
If william is drinking wine.

41:59.117 --> 42:01.984
This will prove amusing
later on.

42:03.087 --> 42:04.821
- I would like to propose
a toast.

42:05.823 --> 42:08.057
To my dear friend,
george crabtree,

42:08.192 --> 42:11.294
And his lovely new bride,
effie.

42:12.497 --> 42:15.565
I wish you a life of
good fortune and happiness.

42:15.700 --> 42:16.766
To george and effie.

42:16.901 --> 42:18.234
- Thank you, sir.
- George and effie.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.902
(glasses tinkling)

42:19.971 --> 42:21.103
(exclamations)

42:22.640 --> 42:25.775
- Hmm!
- Ah! Look at us, george.

42:25.910 --> 42:28.244
Both happily married men now.

42:28.313 --> 42:30.846
- Yes and lucky ones at that,
I should say, sir.

42:30.916 --> 42:32.515
- I should give him wine
more often.

42:33.318 --> 42:34.650
This is a special occasion

42:34.719 --> 42:36.686
Because I ventured back
into the kitchen.

42:37.622 --> 42:39.255
- Huh.
(julia): Help yourself.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.190
(crabtree): Look at that!

42:41.927 --> 42:43.926
- So, what are your plans?

42:43.995 --> 42:45.661
- Well... Oh.

42:47.065 --> 42:49.198
We plan to honeymoon
once we get our affairs
in order here.

42:49.234 --> 42:50.733
George has come into
some money

42:50.735 --> 42:52.401
And we plan on spending it
recklessly.

42:52.470 --> 42:53.603
- Oh, how marvelous!

42:53.738 --> 42:54.670
(laughing)

42:54.706 --> 42:56.405
- Good man, george.
I'm happy for you.

42:56.474 --> 42:59.274
- Thank you, sir. As am I.
- Welcome to wedded bliss.

42:59.311 --> 43:01.944
(baby crying)
- oh! I'll get her.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.681
So what are your plans
after that?

43:04.683 --> 43:06.883
- We haven't discussed that yet.

43:06.885 --> 43:08.751
- A... At least four children,
I should think.

43:08.886 --> 43:11.521
- Four? Is that all?

43:11.523 --> 43:13.289
- Well, yes: Two boys,
two girls.

43:13.358 --> 43:15.157
Or, I don't know,
one boy, three girls.

43:15.193 --> 43:16.292
I'm not fussy,

43:16.361 --> 43:18.494
But I think a small family
should satisfy me.

43:18.563 --> 43:20.163
- Some more wine for you,
detective?

43:20.298 --> 43:22.732
- Oh, I don't think that's
a good idea.

43:22.867 --> 43:25.635
(chuckles)
- ah! Why not?

43:25.770 --> 43:29.238
It's a special occasion,
after all.

43:29.240 --> 43:31.373
And please, call me william.

43:32.344 --> 43:35.444
It's certainly
after business hours.

43:35.480 --> 43:38.514
(julia): Oh! And when is it ever
not business hours?

43:38.516 --> 43:39.449
(laughter)

43:39.584 --> 43:40.516
(bright music)

43:41.586 --> 43:43.119
(â™ª)

44:09.614 --> 44:10.480
Subtitling: Difuze
