Sorry.

01:25.220 --> 01:27.430
( BIRDS CHIRPING )

01:30.600 --> 01:32.930
So did you figure out
what route we're gonna take?

01:33.010 --> 01:36.310
SOKKA: Okay, we just got out of
the desert, so we must be around here.

01:36.390 --> 01:38.600
And we need to go to
Ba Sing Se, which is here.

01:38.690 --> 01:41.690
It looks like the only passage
connecting the south to the north

01:41.770 --> 01:44.070
is this sliver of land
called the Serpent's Pass.

01:44.150 --> 01:47.200
- You're sure that's the best way to go?
- It's the only way.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.740
I mean, it's not like we
have Appa to fly us there.

01:49.820 --> 01:51.160
Shush up about Appa.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.700
Can't you at least
try to be sensitive?

01:55.080 --> 01:56.830
Katara, it's okay.

01:56.910 --> 01:59.210
I know I was upset about
losing Appa before,

01:59.290 --> 02:01.790
but I just want to focus on
getting to Ba Sing Se

02:01.880 --> 02:04.710
and telling the Earth King
about the solar eclipse.

02:05.340 --> 02:09.590
Oh, well, okay.
I'm glad you're doing better.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.470
Then to Ba Sing Se we go.
No more distractions.

02:12.550 --> 02:14.930
Hello there, fellow refugees!

02:19.640 --> 02:22.060
So are you guys headed
to Ba Sing Se too?

02:22.150 --> 02:23.270
Sure are.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.280
We're trying to get there before
my wife, Ying, has her baby.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.030
Great. We can travel through
the Serpent's Pass together.

02:29.570 --> 02:31.410
The Serpent's Pass?

02:31.490 --> 02:34.120
Only the truly desperate
take that deadly route.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.080
Deadly route? Great pick, Sokka!

02:37.160 --> 02:38.660
Well, we are desperate.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.920
You should come with us to Full Moon Bay.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.420
Ferries take refugees
across the lake.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.840
It's the fastest
way to Ba Sing Se.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.840
And it's hidden so the Fire Nation
can't find it.

02:49.220 --> 02:52.550
Hmm, peaceful ferry ride or deadly pass?

03:02.440 --> 03:04.310
I can't believe how many people's lives

03:04.400 --> 03:06.440
have been uprooted
by the Fire Nation.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.360

Who would've thought
after all these years

03:24.750 --> 03:26.710
I'd return to the scene

03:26.800 --> 03:31.380
of my greatest military disgrace
as a tourist?

03:31.470 --> 03:32.630
Look around.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.930
We're not tourists. We're refugees.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.010
Ugh!

03:38.100 --> 03:40.600
I'm sick of eating rotten food,
sleeping in the dirt.

I hear the captain's eating like a king

03:58.620 --> 04:01.120
while all us refugees have
to feed off his scraps.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.080
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

04:03.160 --> 04:05.790
What sort of king
is he eating like?

04:05.880 --> 04:07.840
The fat, happy kind.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.170

- I'm in.

no vegetables on the ferry!

One cabbage slug

04:31.730 --> 04:34.530
could destroy the entire

04:53.050 --> 04:54.260
Passports?

04:54.380 --> 04:57.760
Uh, no one told us we
had to have passports.

04:57.890 --> 05:00.600
Don't you know who this is?
He's the Avatar.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.930
Ah, I see 50 Avatars a day.

05:03.060 --> 05:05.560
And by the way,
not a very impressive costume.

05:09.110 --> 05:10.110

- I'll take care of this.

It is my pleasure to help
anyone of the Beifong family.

05:35.590 --> 05:37.130
It is your pleasure.

I am blind and these
three imbeciles are my valets.

- Is my seeing-eye lemur.

05:45.060 --> 05:46.060
( CHATTERS )

05:46.730 --> 05:49.400
Well, normally it's only one ticket
per passport,

05:49.520 --> 05:52.480
but this document
is so official,

05:52.610 --> 05:54.690
I guess it's worth four tickets.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.450
Thank you very much.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.870
All right!
We scammed that lady good!

06:01.990 --> 06:03.410
Aah!

06:03.540 --> 06:06.620
- Tickets and passports, please.
- Is there a problem?

06:06.750 --> 06:08.960
Yeah, I got a problem with you.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.750
I've seen your type before.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.130
Probably sarcastic,
think you're hilarious.

06:13.250 --> 06:16.050
And let me guess,
you're traveling with the Avatar.

06:16.630 --> 06:17.880
Do I know you?

06:18.510 --> 06:21.090
You mean you don't remember?
Maybe you remember this.

Sokka, it's good to see you!

06:28.890 --> 06:33.150

without your makeup and the new outfit.

06:33.230 --> 06:35.940
That crabby lady makes all
the security guards wear them.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.200
And look at you, sleeveless guy.
Been working out?

06:39.280 --> 06:41.780
Oh, I'll grab a tree branch
and do a few chin touches

06:41.860 --> 06:43.990
every now and then. Nothing major.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.580
Are the other Kyoshi Warriors around?

06:47.660 --> 06:51.330
Yeah. After you left Kyoshi,
we wanted to find a way to help people.

06:51.420 --> 06:54.630

tickets for the ferry?

07:02.010 --> 07:03.800
Wouldn't you just fly across on Appa?

07:05.220 --> 07:06.600
Appa is missing.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.020
We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.

I'm so sorry to hear that.
Are you doing okay?

07:16.520 --> 07:17.690
I'm doing fine.

07:17.820 --> 07:19.780
Would everybody stop
worrying about me?

07:19.900 --> 07:22.740
Avatar Aang, you have to help us!

07:22.860 --> 07:24.740
Someone took all of our belongings,

07:24.870 --> 07:28.700
our passports, our tickets.
Everything's gone!

07:28.790 --> 07:29.790

I'll talk to the lady for you.

No passports, no tickets!

07:36.460 --> 07:38.920
But she's pregnant, and
all their stuff was stolen.

07:39.010 --> 07:40.630
You have to make an exception.

07:40.720 --> 07:41.880
No exceptions!

07:42.220 --> 07:44.680
If I just gave away tickets
willy-nilly to anyone,

07:44.760 --> 07:46.390
there would be no more order.

07:46.470 --> 07:49.270
And you know what that means―
no more civilization!

07:49.350 --> 07:50.890
What if we gave
them our tickets?

07:50.980 --> 07:51.980
- No!
- But―

07:52.060 --> 07:53.060
- Next!
-( SPITS )

Don't worry, you'll
get to the city safely.

07:57.230 --> 07:59.190
I'll lead you through the Serpent's Pass.

08:06.870 --> 08:08.700
I can't believe we gave up our tickets

08:08.790 --> 08:11.000
and now we're going through
the Serpent's Pass.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.410
I can't believe you're
still complaining about it.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
I'm coming too!

08:15.880 --> 08:17.630
Are you sure that's a good idea?

08:17.710 --> 08:19.590
Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come.

08:19.710 --> 08:20.710
I do. It's just―

08:20.840 --> 08:22.470
Just what?

08:22.590 --> 08:24.180
Nothing. I'm glad you're coming.

08:29.310 --> 08:31.180
This is the Serpent's Pass?

08:31.270 --> 08:32.890
I thought it would be more wind-y.

08:32.980 --> 08:36.100
You know, like a serpent.
Hmm, I guess they misnamed it.

08:36.190 --> 08:39.020
Look at this writing. How awful.

08:39.110 --> 08:40.360
What does it say?

08:40.610 --> 08:42.780
It says, "Abandon hope."

08:43.400 --> 08:46.990
How could we abandon hope?
That's all we have.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.620
AANG: I don't know.

08:48.740 --> 08:51.580
The monks used to say that hope
is just a distraction.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.750
So maybe we do need to abandon it.

08:53.870 --> 08:55.250
What are you talking about?

08:56.120 --> 08:58.170
Hope isn't going to
get us into Ba Sing Se,

08:58.290 --> 09:00.000
and it's not gonna find Appa.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.760
We need to focus on what
we're doing right now,

09:02.840 --> 09:04.720
and that's getting across this pass.

something big on the other side

to find out what it is.

Hey, no problem, Sokka.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.460
Suki, you shouldn't
sleep there.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.170
Who knows how stable
this ledge is?

10:25.250 --> 10:26.800
It could give way at any moment.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.930
Sokka, I'm fine.
Stop worrying!

10:29.010 --> 10:30.640
You're right, you're right.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.180
You're perfectly capable
of taking care of yourself.

10:33.260 --> 10:34.390
Wait!

10:34.470 --> 10:37.230
Oh, never mind.
I thought I saw a spider. But you're fine.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.090
SMELLERBEE: Guard's coming!

11:32.700 --> 11:35.070
You know, it's okay to miss Appa.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.290
What's going on with you?

11:38.370 --> 11:40.830
In the desert, all you cared
about was finding Appa.

11:40.910 --> 11:43.250
And now it's like you don't
care about him at all.

11:43.330 --> 11:45.170
You saw what I did out there.

11:45.290 --> 11:48.750
I was so angry about losing
Appa, I couldn't control myself.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.630
I hated feeling like that.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.550
But now you're not letting
yourself feel anything.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.050
I know sometimes
it hurts more to hope,

11:56.180 --> 11:58.560
and it hurts more to care.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.230
But you have to promise me
that you won't stop caring.

12:02.810 --> 12:04.310
Come on, you need a hug.

12:05.810 --> 12:07.730
AANG: Thank you for you concern, Katara.

12:21.580 --> 12:24.170
- It's a beautiful moon.
- Yeah, it really is.

12:26.790 --> 12:28.710
Look, I know you're just trying to help,

12:28.840 --> 12:30.670
but I can take care of myself.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.050
I know you can.

12:32.170 --> 12:34.470
Then why are you
acting so overprotective?

12:34.550 --> 12:37.010
It's so hard to lose
someone you care about.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.890
Something happened at the North Pole

12:38.970 --> 12:40.680
and I couldn't protect someone.

12:40.770 --> 12:43.270
I don't want anything like
that to ever happen again.

12:43.350 --> 12:45.310
I lost someone I cared about.

12:45.440 --> 12:48.230
He didn't die. He just went away.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.480
I only had a few days
to get to know him,

12:50.610 --> 12:54.360
but he was smart,
and brave, and funny.

12:54.490 --> 12:57.660
Who is this guy?
Is he taller than me?

12:57.780 --> 12:59.660
No, he's about your height.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.790
- Is he better-looking?
- It is you, stupid!

Oh.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.210
I can't.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.090
I'm sorry.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.760
No, you shouldn't be.

13:27.230 --> 13:29.690
So, Smellerbee.

13:29.770 --> 13:32.730
That's an unusual name for a young man.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.780
Maybe it's because I'm not a man.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.320
I'm a girl!

13:37.570 --> 13:39.910
Oh, now I see!

13:40.030 --> 13:43.200
It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl!

13:46.250 --> 13:48.170
I know. You're right.

13:48.290 --> 13:50.210
As long as I'm confident with who I am,

it doesn't matter what

I can't wait to set my

14:07.270 --> 14:09.150
So you've been there before?

14:09.270 --> 14:13.520
Once, when I was a different man.

14:13.650 --> 14:16.570
I've done some things in my past
that I'm not proud of.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.110
But that's why I'm going to Ba Sing Se,

14:19.240 --> 14:22.370
for a new beginning,
a second chance.

14:22.490 --> 14:25.040
That's very noble of you.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.710
I believe people can change
their lives if they want to.
