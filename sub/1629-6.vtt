WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:03.451
(PANTING)

00:04.255 --> 00:05.836
MAN: Hurry! After her!

00:08.968 --> 00:10.128
Stop!

00:21.480 --> 00:22.606
(GRUNTING)

00:25.943 --> 00:27.524
(PANTING)

00:28.112 --> 00:29.101
(GASPS)

00:34.452 --> 00:35.612
Really?

00:37.330 --> 00:39.195
You're a long way from home,
Snow White.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.281
Did you really think
you could hide from the Queen here?

00:41.834 --> 00:43.540
Actually, yes.

00:43.628 --> 00:47.291
Well, don't worry.
We're here to take you back.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.838
The Queen is eager to see you again.

00:51.302 --> 00:52.917
Not gonna happen.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.468
No, no, no. Wait!

01:19.163 --> 01:21.154
(GASPS)

01:21.999 --> 01:24.411
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:24.502 --> 01:25.582
Thank you.

01:25.670 --> 01:27.001
No problem.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.204
You might wanna try diving
in calmer waters next time.

01:34.512 --> 01:36.924
-You're a...
-Yeah, I'm a mermaid.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.340
Name's Ariel.

01:55.992 --> 01:58.153
REGINA: Focus.

01:58.494 --> 01:59.483
Concentrate.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.364
It's kind of hard
when you're talking in my ear.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.487
And when the wind blows,

02:03.582 --> 02:07.996
or it's raining,
or someone's shooting arrows at you.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.839
Yes, concentration's hard.
That's the point.

02:14.719 --> 02:18.962
Find your anger and use it to focus.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.217
No. There has to be a way
without going dark.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.095
You're such a pathetic waste of ability.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.222
And you're a monster.

02:28.107 --> 02:29.893
-Sme|| that?
-What?

02:30.067 --> 02:31.056
(FIRE CRACKLING)

02:32.236 --> 02:34.192
Smoke.

02:38.284 --> 02:40.445
(SIGHS) This is a bad idea.

02:40.536 --> 02:43.118
She has it in her.
She should learn to use it.

02:45.041 --> 02:46.952
We just have to trust her.

02:47.043 --> 02:49.079
Yeah. It's not Emma I don't trust.

02:54.425 --> 02:56.586
We need to talk.

02:59.263 --> 03:00.469
Pan paid me a visit.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.895
He told me that Neal is alive.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.389
That he's on this very island.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.475
No, Emma saw him. He was shot.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.147
He fell through a portal.
No one can survive that.

03:12.234 --> 03:15.476
Well, he did. And now he's here.

03:15.571 --> 03:18.153
He said he took him from this very camp
while we were off in his cave.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.822
According to Pan.
If he's telling the truth.

03:20.910 --> 03:23.492
Why would he tell you?
What does he hope to gain?

03:24.747 --> 03:26.908
Who knows why he does anything?

03:26.999 --> 03:28.239
He has his reasons,

03:28.334 --> 03:30.996
but it's a sure bet
they're not good ones.

03:31.087 --> 03:32.247
He's telling the truth.

03:39.345 --> 03:40.755
The tracks.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.508
And a scuffle. Someone was here while
we were gone. We have to tell her.

03:43.599 --> 03:47.387
No, no, no. She already lost Neal once,
and if this is a game,

03:47.478 --> 03:49.639
we can't put her through
losing him again.

03:50.106 --> 03:51.391
He's right.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.564
Either way,
telling her is what Pan wants.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.437
Which is why we shouldn't do it.

03:55.528 --> 03:57.894
You want to find him
without letting her know?

03:57.988 --> 03:59.489
Why hurt her unnecessarily?

04:00.449 --> 04:01.734
I've never lied to her before.

04:01.826 --> 04:02.861
You're not lying.

04:02.952 --> 04:05.694
You're just keeping a secret
until confirmation.

04:06.205 --> 04:10.039
Secrets always seem to keep us
from the people we really care about.

04:10.126 --> 04:12.833
And sometimes secrets
protect the people we love.

04:17.299 --> 04:20.291
What on earth would possess you
to jump like that?

04:20.386 --> 04:22.752
Have you ever been chased
by an Evil Queen?

04:22.847 --> 04:24.553
I can't say that l have.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.596
It makes you do crazy things.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.140
Well, that I know.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.517
Are you on the run from someone?

04:31.522 --> 04:32.887
More like on the run to someone.

04:33.691 --> 04:34.851
What's his name?

04:36.360 --> 04:39.227
Come on, the one thing
that makes everyone crazy is love.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.071
Eric. He's a prince in this kingdom.

04:43.993 --> 04:47.030
So, wait, he lives on land, he's human?

04:50.499 --> 04:54.492
About a year ago, his ship wrecked,
and l rescued him. I do that.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.085
He was unconscious. We never spoke.

04:57.173 --> 05:01.712
But when I looked at his face,
ljust... I knew.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.675
Love at first sight.

05:04.388 --> 05:05.753
It sounds dumb, I know.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.179
No.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.431
It doesn't sound dumb at all.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.144
Interesting.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.602
I collect things.

05:17.693 --> 05:20.059
And I found this.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.490
There's a ball at his castle tonight.

05:23.574 --> 05:27.112
The annual Under the Sea celebration
honoring the Sea Goddess, Ursula.

05:27.203 --> 05:30.491
And I was hoping to meet him there.

05:30.581 --> 05:33.869
How are you planning on doing that

05:34.418 --> 05:35.578
with a tail?

05:55.064 --> 05:56.270
(CHUCKUNG)

05:57.441 --> 05:59.272
How did you do that?

05:59.360 --> 06:01.942
You really know nothing
of your mermaid mythology, do you?

06:02.279 --> 06:05.316
Probably about as much as you know
about people mythology,

06:05.407 --> 06:08.444
-I think.
-Good point.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.364
Anyway, every year, at the highest tide,
the legend says

06:11.455 --> 06:14.447
that the Sea Goddess, Ursula,
grants our kind

06:14.542 --> 06:17.659
with the ability to walk on dry land
until the next high tide.

06:17.753 --> 06:19.994
-Which is when?
-Twelve hours.

06:20.089 --> 06:21.545
Enough time for dinner
and dancing and...

06:21.632 --> 06:25.295
Twelve hours? Why don't you
ask this Ursula for a little more time?

06:25.386 --> 06:28.048
Well, no one's seen her
in a thousand years.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.719
She's a bit of a myth.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.547
Well, myth or no myth.

06:31.642 --> 06:35.601
You saved my life. The least I can do
is help you find the love of yours.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.979
Thank you. But can you keep a secret?

06:39.149 --> 06:41.060
-Mmm-hmm.
-l'm a mermaid.

06:42.111 --> 06:43.396
Yeah, I got that.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.233
But Eric doesn't know that,

06:47.324 --> 06:51.067
so can we just maybe
keep that under the sea for now?

06:51.161 --> 06:53.152
Isn't that something
he eventually needs to find out?

06:53.831 --> 06:55.822
Just let him fall for me first, okay?

06:56.500 --> 06:57.740
Okay.

06:57.835 --> 07:00.201
Your secret's safe with me.

07:07.428 --> 07:08.463
-Done.
-Not a problem.

07:08.554 --> 07:09.543
Where're you guys going?

07:09.638 --> 07:11.344
-To get water.
-Get firewood.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.922
Guys, what's going on?

07:13.017 --> 07:14.006
Neal's alive.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.931
Neal is...

07:20.274 --> 07:21.605
Alive?

07:21.692 --> 07:24.024
Maybe.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.442
Sorry. She deserved to know.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.037
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

07:42.212 --> 07:44.123
(SlGHS) You can't see the future here.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.835
(SCOFFS) It's impossible
to see the future

07:47.926 --> 07:50.133
in a place where time stands still.

07:50.304 --> 07:54.593
I may not see the future here,
but I can make one happen.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.308
(LAUGHS) Was that a threat?

07:58.395 --> 08:01.057
And here I made you
your favorite breakfast.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.649
Eggs in a basket.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.395
I thought you could use it.
You look a little down in the dumps.

08:05.778 --> 08:07.143
I'm fine.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.852
Sure you are, Rumple.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.905
You've lost your son, Neal. Again.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.157
And Henry is unattainable

08:14.244 --> 08:17.407
because, well,
you'd have to go through me.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.655
And we both know you can't.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.455
You still like the yolk runny, don't you?

08:23.587 --> 08:25.248
What do you want?

08:25.464 --> 08:27.000
Well, if you won't eat, then lwill.

08:29.927 --> 08:33.385
I'm just trying to point out
the silver lining in your cloudy life.

08:33.472 --> 08:36.259
That by killing you,
all our troubles end?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.553
(LAUGHS)

08:38.811 --> 08:41.348
We both know
that's not going to happen.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.646
Because the only way to do that
is for you to die, too.

08:45.109 --> 08:48.522
You can go. Leave the island.

08:48.612 --> 08:52.696
And abandon my son? And Henry?
I don't think so.

08:53.367 --> 08:57.076
Okay. Even if you did save them,
which you won't,

08:57.162 --> 08:58.538
what would be the point?

08:58.622 --> 09:01.455
They will never forgive you
for all the horrible things you've done.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.998
You don't know that.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.500
Have you forgiven your father?

09:09.967 --> 09:13.380
You see my point?
Back to that silver lining then.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.382
You have a nice girl
waiting for you back in Storybrooke.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.588
Belle, is it?

09:17.683 --> 09:20.766
Stop this foolishness
and go back to her.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.389
Make a new start.

09:22.479 --> 09:26.267
She looks fertile, maybe a new child?

09:26.358 --> 09:29.942
You and I both know
that's the only future for you.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.484
Assuming you want to live.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.694
Enjoy the eggs.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.083
This is a waste of time.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.171
He's toying with us.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.665
I don't think so.

09:54.136 --> 09:57.048
Look, more scuffling.
Someone was definitely resisting.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.179
How do we know that means Neal?

10:00.058 --> 10:01.389
I mean, someone
was fighting for his life.

10:01.727 --> 10:04.184
Are you really going to fall for this?

10:08.108 --> 10:10.520
Fine.

10:10.611 --> 10:14.229
You want to follow the evil munchkin's
dirt road, be my guest.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.524
Wait. Where are you going?

10:16.700 --> 10:18.110
To save our son.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.408
We need to stick together.

10:19.495 --> 10:21.702
No. We don't.

10:21.789 --> 10:25.452
You may be prepared to risk Henry's life
over some heartbroken fool's errand,

10:25.542 --> 10:27.453
but I'm not.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.000
I'm tired of waiting around.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.627
What if she's right? Pan could be lying.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.633
Just because it seems too good
to be true, doesn't mean it is.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.599
Don't give up. You owe it to Henry
to find out if his father's still alive.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.473
And you owe it to yourself.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.309
Wow.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.104
It's even better than I imagined.

10:53.195 --> 10:54.275
Do I look okay?

10:54.363 --> 10:55.398
Is this how people dress?

10:55.489 --> 10:56.478
You look fantastic.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.688
Does it fit right?
Because it's just a little...

10:57.783 --> 11:00.024
Tight? That's the corset.
It's supposed to be.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.405
How do you know all these things?

11:02.788 --> 11:05.325
In another life, I was a princess.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.952
Well, perhaps you will be one again.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.453
I doubt it.

11:09.545 --> 11:11.536
-But tonight you can be.
-(CHUCKLES)

11:15.592 --> 11:16.581
Remember what I taught you.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.088
What's this?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.168
Mini-trident.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.013
Salad-trident?

11:24.101 --> 11:26.592
-Fork. Salad fork.
-Oh, um...

11:26.937 --> 11:27.926
Oh...

11:28.438 --> 11:29.939
It's really not that valuable.

11:32.276 --> 11:35.439
There! Look. Is that him?

11:36.780 --> 11:37.895
Yes!

11:38.282 --> 11:40.068
That's him.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.992
He's just as I remembered.

11:44.079 --> 11:47.571
Less wet, but more handsome.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.547
Go to him.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.670
Just walk over there?

12:00.971 --> 12:03.178
Love at first sight
doesn't need much prompting.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.639
(GRUNTS)

12:12.357 --> 12:13.813
Would you like to dance?

12:14.484 --> 12:16.315
Might be easier than walking.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.478
No one's dancing.

12:20.324 --> 12:22.280
That's one of the perks
of being the Prince.

12:22.826 --> 12:25.158
If I want to dance, I can.

12:33.462 --> 12:34.668
l'm Eric.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.586
Ariel.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.790
You look familiar, have we met?

12:41.303 --> 12:42.964
I don't think so.

12:44.181 --> 12:46.467
I know where it's from.

12:47.517 --> 12:48.506
Where?

12:51.021 --> 12:52.682
l was in a shipwreck.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.185
I nearly drowned. Someone saved me.

12:55.692 --> 12:56.681
I didn't see them,

12:58.278 --> 13:00.189
but I've had a recurring dream
since then.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.695
Of a face.

13:02.783 --> 13:03.989
Your face.

13:04.368 --> 13:06.780
That can't be. I'm new in town.

13:06.870 --> 13:10.158
So, how could I have
possibly saved you?

13:10.707 --> 13:12.413
I know.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.867
Ursula's the one who saved me.

13:14.962 --> 13:19.046
And in doing so,
she showed me a vision of my future.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.123
That's the face I saw.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.835
That's you.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.547
Ursula is just a myth.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.928
Is she?

13:31.019 --> 13:33.010
Because you're right here in front of me.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.179
Now, what brings you to our kingdom?

13:36.900 --> 13:40.768
Well, I wanna see the world.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.727
Then you and l have
something in common.

13:43.407 --> 13:44.988
I'm leaving in the morning.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.940
A grand expedition. To do just that.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.024
What?

13:49.329 --> 13:50.910
I've been planning it for years.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.155
This shall be my final Ursula Ball.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.330
For tomorrow,

13:54.418 --> 13:56.659
l'm exploring the unknown lands.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.584
The desert from this realm to Agrabah.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.585
You're actually doing it.

14:03.427 --> 14:05.509
I've always wanted to see the world.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.096
Then come.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.216
| see it in your eyes, you want to.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.681
Unless l've misread things.

14:11.768 --> 14:15.602
No. I mean... Yes.

14:16.148 --> 14:17.137
I mean no.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.435
l'm pressuring you. That's unfair.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.150
How about this?

14:22.237 --> 14:25.445
Tomorrow morning, I'll wait for you.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.153
If you show up, I will be filled with joy.

14:29.244 --> 14:33.908
If you don't, well, I may be heartbroken,

14:33.999 --> 14:36.615
but I'll understand.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.326
It's so nice to meet you, Ariel.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.086
(APPLAUSE)

14:54.394 --> 14:55.383
What?

14:55.479 --> 14:57.140
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

15:03.487 --> 15:04.727
Ugh.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.688
That's the woman that rescued
Snow White. The red hair.

15:07.783 --> 15:09.739
lt's unmistakable.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.408
I thought she had a tail,
but, yes, I'm sure.

15:12.496 --> 15:15.738
Next time you let someone
fall to their death,

15:16.166 --> 15:18.999
make sure they're actually dead.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.042
She looked dead.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.835
No!

15:23.590 --> 15:26.548
Death looks more like this.

15:26.635 --> 15:27.795
(NECK SNAPS)

15:30.555 --> 15:33.171
(STUTTERING) Shall I lead
more knights after Snow White?

15:33.850 --> 15:37.013
You boys
have proved unequal to the task.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.518
(GASPS)

15:41.274 --> 15:43.105
No.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.394
I've got a new idea.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.416
Look at them go.

16:01.503 --> 16:05.371
So determined to find
their missing friend.

16:05.465 --> 16:09.834
Speaking of that friend,
what shall we do with Neal?

16:09.928 --> 16:11.884
It's time to move him.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.304
Take him to the Echo Cave.

16:15.851 --> 16:18.968
The game is about to get interesting.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.901
You don't know what to do, do you?

16:35.453 --> 16:37.739
No, I don't.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.617
Come home to Storybrooke.

16:39.708 --> 16:44.543
And just leave Henry,
my family, behind?

16:44.629 --> 16:48.622
Come with me
and we can start a new family.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.254
Our own family.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.802
That's what I want. Don't you?

16:55.182 --> 16:59.266
No, you can't want anything.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.308
You're just a figment
of my subconscious.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.933
No. No, I am really here.

17:09.571 --> 17:13.530
Now take my hand.
Believe in our love and we can go back.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.364
Take it, Rumple. Please.

17:19.706 --> 17:20.866
Come home to me.

17:23.793 --> 17:24.919
(GASPING)

17:27.130 --> 17:28.119
Enough of this!

17:28.215 --> 17:29.375
Regina!

17:29.466 --> 17:31.331
Are you really going to fall for this?

17:31.426 --> 17:33.132
(GASPING) Rumple, stop her.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.710
Don't listen to him.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.590
-What are you doing?
-Showing you the truth.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.182
(SCREAMING)

17:38.266 --> 17:39.597
No!

17:42.395 --> 17:43.976
Look who you're really dealing with!

17:47.901 --> 17:49.141
Pan.

18:01.498 --> 18:02.863
I kissed him.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.289
What?

18:04.376 --> 18:05.411
-Who?
-Hook.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.037
I kissed Hook.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.497
Oh!

18:09.256 --> 18:10.291
VVhy?

18:10.382 --> 18:15.001
I don't know. lwas...
It's been a while. I was feeling good.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.255
Did it mean anything?

18:16.346 --> 18:17.586
It was just a kiss.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.506
I'm sure Neal will understand.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.470
If he's still alive.

18:23.561 --> 18:26.223
Emma, I get what you're doing,
you know.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.726
You don't want to open yourself up
to the hope that he's alive,

18:28.817 --> 18:30.227
but you should.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.728
VVhy?

18:33.780 --> 18:36.066
Because you deserve
a happy ending, Emma.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.316
And happy endings
always start with hope.

18:40.245 --> 18:42.236
This was a terrible, terrible mistake.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.286
You met him. It's a start.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.080
More like an end.

18:46.167 --> 18:50.035
Because I can't ask him to give up
his dream for someone he just met.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.124
Maybe you're the dream.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.751
Maybe.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.583
But I can't make him choose.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.174
It's not right.

19:00.265 --> 19:03.473
You can't make him choose?
Or you don't wanna make him choose?

19:05.895 --> 19:08.022
You're afraid.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.095
Of What?

19:09.190 --> 19:11.317
Of his choice.

19:11.693 --> 19:12.899
(SlGHS)

19:13.903 --> 19:17.270
There's nothing about any of this
that's easy.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.446
So take my advice.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.574
Do the hard thing.

19:21.661 --> 19:25.028
Be honest. No secrets.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.865
Open your heart to love.
It is so worth the risk.

19:28.460 --> 19:32.794
Even if you get hurt, you'll know.
You'll know you tried.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.922
| just need some time to think.

19:36.801 --> 19:40.794
Well, you have three hours.
So I'll be here if you need me.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.773
What should I do?

19:54.736 --> 19:56.317
That's right.

19:56.404 --> 20:00.568
I'm talking to you, Ursula.
Mythical goddess of the sea.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.035
He thought you brought us together,

20:03.119 --> 20:05.781
but we both know that's a lie.

20:05.872 --> 20:09.831
So tell me, between girlfriends,

20:09.918 --> 20:10.953
what do I do?

20:13.296 --> 20:14.877
Nothing, huh?

20:16.466 --> 20:19.799
Well, what should I expect
from a long-dead myth?

20:20.303 --> 20:23.045
You gave me legs, but that's it, right?

20:23.139 --> 20:25.630
No answers?

20:26.601 --> 20:29.217
Thanks. For nothing.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.562
(RUMBLING)

20:47.539 --> 20:49.325
Ursula?

20:51.418 --> 20:56.378
Hello, Ariel.

21:02.220 --> 21:05.587
What is this? Amateur hour?

21:06.933 --> 21:09.265
Did you really believe that was Belle?

21:09.727 --> 21:11.683
Why are you here?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.853
Well, for starters,
it appears I'm saving your ass.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.476
You were about to be Pan's lunch.

21:15.567 --> 21:16.807
Oh, what do you care?

21:16.943 --> 21:17.932
(SCOFFS)

21:18.027 --> 21:20.939
I care because I've been camping
with the Charmings for a week

21:21.030 --> 21:22.110
and getting nowhere.

21:24.409 --> 21:28.152
If we're gonna get Henry, I need you.

21:28.246 --> 21:30.703
I need Rumplestiltskin.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.246
The problem, dearie,

21:32.333 --> 21:35.541
is that Rumplestiltskin
can only stop Pan by dying.

21:35.628 --> 21:39.120
You're not gonna die at anyone's hands
but my own.

21:40.383 --> 21:43.375
We're the two most powerful
practitioners of magic

21:43.470 --> 21:45.381
who have ever lived.

21:45.472 --> 21:49.465
The Evil Queen and The Dark One
joining forces?

21:49.559 --> 21:54.553
I'd say we can find another way
to handle one smug teenager.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.138
You've never faced him. I have.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.942
And I know what killing him requires.
And that is my life.

22:03.156 --> 22:07.149
As much as I want to,
maybe we don't have to kill him.

22:07.243 --> 22:10.735
If that's the case,

22:10.830 --> 22:13.287
then maybe we can find another way.

22:13.374 --> 22:14.750
Something to contain him,

22:14.834 --> 22:16.210
some other fate.

22:16.294 --> 22:17.579
A fate worse than death?

22:20.632 --> 22:22.964
Now we're talking.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.918
There's my malevolent imp.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.424
Is there a spell you know?
Something we can enact?

22:28.515 --> 22:31.757
No, but back in my shop,
I might have just the thing.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.591
Why didn't you bring it with you
in the first place?

22:33.686 --> 22:37.019
Because I came here to kill him
and die in the process.

22:37.106 --> 22:40.473
(LAUGHING) I could've told you
that wasn't going to happen.

22:41.694 --> 22:45.937
You forget, dear,
I've known you a long time.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.273
I know all about your survival instincts.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.778
Well, theyjust kicked in.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.450
Good.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.746
So now we just need a change of plans.

22:55.792 --> 22:58.909
We need to get back to your shop
and pick up this magical item,

22:59.003 --> 23:01.335
and then all of our problems are solved.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.959
Crossing realms? Is that all?

23:04.842 --> 23:08.505
Yes. That's all.

23:11.182 --> 23:13.264
You're real.

23:13.351 --> 23:16.138
Ha! As real as the legs
you're standing on.

23:16.229 --> 23:19.392
I'm sorry if I was rude before. I...

23:19.816 --> 23:23.308
My dear, sweet child, don't fret.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.984
I understand.

23:25.321 --> 23:28.813
But you're also in luck.

23:29.784 --> 23:35.074
I can help with your dilemma.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.155
With Prince Eric?

23:38.042 --> 23:39.498
l have to tell him the truth, don't I?

23:39.627 --> 23:40.833
Bah!

23:40.920 --> 23:42.581
Your friend was mistaken.

23:43.506 --> 23:44.586
You sure?

23:44.674 --> 23:46.710
Of course I'm sure.

23:47.176 --> 23:51.135
If you tell him the truth,
that you're from two different worlds,

23:51.222 --> 23:54.055
he won't accept that.

23:54.142 --> 23:55.222
Or you.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.642
How is this helping again?

23:57.729 --> 24:00.061
What if I told you

24:00.148 --> 24:04.061
that you could keep your legs?

24:04.777 --> 24:07.940
That you can walk on land?

24:08.489 --> 24:11.822
Be a part of his world

24:11.909 --> 24:15.527
forever,

24:15.997 --> 24:19.114
without ever telling him your secret?

24:19.542 --> 24:23.034
That you're a mermaid.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.536
Would you be interested?

24:26.257 --> 24:27.417
Of course.

24:28.551 --> 24:29.882
(CHUCKLES)

24:35.058 --> 24:36.093
What is it?

24:36.184 --> 24:38.300
-What happened?
-Something amazing.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.430
And notjust for me,
but for the both of us.

24:40.521 --> 24:41.727
What are you talking about?

24:42.023 --> 24:43.604
I received a gift.

24:43.691 --> 24:46.899
A gift that will allow me to spend
the rest of my life with Eric

24:46.986 --> 24:49.602
and a way for you
to escape your Evil Queen.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.490
How is that possible?

24:51.574 --> 24:52.859
Look.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.114
What are you doing?

24:57.455 --> 24:59.946
This is no ordinary bracelet.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.664
Look.

25:03.086 --> 25:05.247
What's happening to me?

25:05.338 --> 25:07.294
(GASPS)

25:07.882 --> 25:09.497
You're a mermaid.

25:09.592 --> 25:13.005
Ariel, what have you done?

25:13.096 --> 25:16.338
The bracelet, it's magic.
I got it from Ursula.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.297
By wearing it, you get my tail

25:18.393 --> 25:20.054
and I can keep my legs.

25:20.144 --> 25:23.102
That's the price, but it's a good price.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.975
Don't you see? You can escape.

25:25.358 --> 25:29.476
You can travel to my land, a land
where the Evil Queen cannot follow.

25:29.862 --> 25:33.070
And you can have a life.
A wonderful life.

25:33.157 --> 25:34.272
Under the sea.

25:34.367 --> 25:35.948
Ursula gave you the bracelet?

25:36.035 --> 25:37.115
Yes.

25:37.412 --> 25:39.368
Ursula's a myth.

25:39.455 --> 25:42.993
She hasn't existed for thousands
of years. She's not real.

25:43.584 --> 25:45.666
Yes, she is.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.163
Actually,

25:47.255 --> 25:48.791
it's not entirely true.

25:50.425 --> 25:51.585
What's going on?

25:52.885 --> 25:54.170
(CHUCKLES)

25:54.262 --> 25:56.594
Well, well, well.

25:56.681 --> 25:58.387
Look at the catch of the day.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.302
Ursula?

26:01.394 --> 26:02.884
Oh, this isn't Ursula.

26:02.979 --> 26:04.685
This is Regina,

26:04.772 --> 26:06.854
the Evil Queen.

26:12.447 --> 26:14.028
The tracks lead directly into that cave.

26:14.115 --> 26:16.777
This must be
where Pan is keeping Neal.

26:16.868 --> 26:17.948
If the cave is some sort of prison,

26:18.035 --> 26:21.368
why aren't there any guards
posted to stop us?

26:21.456 --> 26:23.037
Because this prison
doesn't require guards.

26:25.626 --> 26:26.786
(HOOK SlGHS)

26:27.545 --> 26:28.660
Echo Cave.

26:28.755 --> 26:29.870
You know it?

26:30.381 --> 26:31.882
All too well.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.465
I lost half my crew
inside those rock walls.

26:36.012 --> 26:39.630
The only way to rescue someone
from inside is to reveal a secret.

26:40.933 --> 26:44.551
A secret? That's all?

26:44.645 --> 26:46.931
Your darkest secret.

26:47.023 --> 26:49.355
Echo Cave derives its name
from an old saying.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.728
"The deeper the lie,
the more truth in its echo."

26:52.195 --> 26:55.437
The cave demands
that you reveal a truth about yourself.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.362
A secret you would never admit
to anyone.

26:57.450 --> 26:58.735
This is ridiculous.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.362
Don't kill the messenger, love.

27:00.453 --> 27:03.115
Even if we spill our guts, how do we
know Neal is still alive in there?

27:03.206 --> 27:05.413
Because this is what Pan wants.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.081
He wants us to rescue him.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.408
VVhy?

27:08.503 --> 27:10.289
So that we reveal our secrets.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.210
He believes, once we do,

27:12.924 --> 27:15.540
our secrets will destroy us.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.967
Having trouble with your fin?

27:22.058 --> 27:23.343
l'll figure it out.

27:23.434 --> 27:24.765
Snow, the bracelet.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.383
(GASPING)

27:26.687 --> 27:28.143
QUEEN: The wearer can't take it off.

27:28.564 --> 27:31.180
Oh, did I leave that detail out?

27:31.484 --> 27:33.440
(QUEEN CHUCKLES)

27:33.653 --> 27:35.609
For once, Snow,

27:35.696 --> 27:37.903
you won't be able to run away.

27:38.908 --> 27:40.068
You tricked me?

27:40.368 --> 27:42.700
You went to a long-dead octopus
for advice,

27:42.787 --> 27:44.402
and you're gonna blame me
for your problems?

27:45.414 --> 27:46.915
This is wrong.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.250
Uh-uh-uh.

27:49.001 --> 27:52.118
Sorry, dear. You're not helping her.

27:52.213 --> 27:53.544
Ariel, get out of here!

27:53.881 --> 27:58.170
For once we're in agreement.
Get out of here, mermaid.

27:58.261 --> 27:59.967
Not if you're going to hurt my friend.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.920
You have a choice.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.801
Your friend is going to be hurt
either way.

28:05.059 --> 28:09.302
The real question is
whether you're going to join her.

28:09.689 --> 28:12.021
Or are you going to run off
and get your happy ending?

28:12.733 --> 28:15.315
QUEEN: Hmm? Go on,

28:15.653 --> 28:18.645
there are no second chances.

28:18.739 --> 28:21.446
SNOW WHITE: It's okay, Ariel.

28:21.534 --> 28:23.525
I can't keep running forever.

28:23.619 --> 28:26.702
You have a chance at happiness.

28:26.789 --> 28:28.620
That's something
the Queen will never have.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.915
Eric is going to leave any moment.
Go to him.

28:31.544 --> 28:33.626
Listen to her, Ariel!

28:33.921 --> 28:38.255
Are you really going to give up
the love of your life

28:38.342 --> 28:39.752
for a friend?

28:42.847 --> 28:44.178
I'm sorry.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.395
Now, where were we?

28:57.570 --> 28:59.356
Oh, right.

28:59.447 --> 29:02.530
The catch of the day!

29:03.993 --> 29:05.233
(CHOKING)

29:05.328 --> 29:06.568

29:15.588 --> 29:16.873
What are you doing?

29:16.964 --> 29:18.044
(SNOW WHITE GASPS)

29:20.468 --> 29:21.799
Hold your breath.

29:30.853 --> 29:31.842
(GROWLS)

30:05.054 --> 30:06.590
NEAL: Emma! (ECHOING)

30:07.640 --> 30:08.675
Neal.

30:10.267 --> 30:11.723
It must be 100 feet across.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.927
Even if we fashion
some sort of rope,

30:14.021 --> 30:16.433
there's nothing to attach it to.
No way to swing over.

30:16.524 --> 30:17.604
So what do we do?

30:18.943 --> 30:20.649
I told you what needs to be done.

30:21.570 --> 30:24.027
Consider this the moment of truth.
Literally.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.188
Now. Who wants to kick things off?

30:26.283 --> 30:27.318
So, what?

30:27.410 --> 30:29.742
Someone tells their secret
and they sprout wings?

30:29.829 --> 30:31.694
I don't know the particulars.
Only what I've been told.

30:31.789 --> 30:33.905
Then how do you know it'll work?

30:34.125 --> 30:35.285
(HOOK SlGHS)

30:39.797 --> 30:42.163
There's only one way to find out,
lsuppose.

30:44.552 --> 30:45.758
(SlGHS)

30:47.388 --> 30:48.673
I kissed Emma.

30:49.849 --> 30:51.931
-You did what?
-David, now is not the time.

30:52.018 --> 30:55.636
I already told Mary Margaret,
so technically it's not a secret.

30:55.730 --> 30:58.392
And it was just a kiss.

30:58.482 --> 31:00.268
How's that your darkest secret?

31:00.901 --> 31:02.607
It's what the kiss exposed.

31:03.904 --> 31:04.939
My secret is

31:05.656 --> 31:10.650
I never thought I'd be capable of
letting go of my first love, of my Milah,

31:11.871 --> 31:14.203
to believe
that I could find someone else.

31:15.332 --> 31:16.947
That is until I met you.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.079
(RUMBLING)

31:33.517 --> 31:35.508
-Mary Margaret.
-No, no, no.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.303
Me next.

31:39.857 --> 31:42.018
Ever since the curse broke,

31:42.109 --> 31:44.191
since we found each other,
since we found Emma,

31:45.321 --> 31:46.731
in all of that happiness,

31:46.822 --> 31:49.564
there's something
I haven't wanted to admit.

31:50.785 --> 31:54.778
Our daughter is a beautiful,

31:54.872 --> 31:59.241
smart, amazing woman,
whom I love very much,

31:59.335 --> 32:02.623
and of whom I could not be more proud.

32:04.715 --> 32:06.706
But she's all grown up.

32:08.844 --> 32:12.803
And as much as I want to pretend
I'm okay with that, I'm not.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.257
We missed it, David.

32:16.977 --> 32:18.513
What we have with her is unique.

32:19.313 --> 32:21.304
But it's not what I wanted.

32:22.691 --> 32:24.022
We were cheated out of everything.

32:24.485 --> 32:28.819
Her first step, her first word,
her first smile,

32:28.906 --> 32:30.191
we missed it all.

32:31.617 --> 32:32.732
What are you saying?

32:33.994 --> 32:35.279
When we get off this island

32:35.371 --> 32:37.282
and get back to Storybrooke,
I want another go at it.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.289
I want to have another baby.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.330
(RUMBLING)

32:53.806 --> 32:55.546
Nothing in this world
would make me happier.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.723
And I know,

32:57.810 --> 33:02.679
with all my heart, that you would make
an amazing mother.

33:05.442 --> 33:07.353
But it can never happen.

33:08.070 --> 33:09.526
At least, not with me.

33:12.158 --> 33:13.318
What do you mean?

33:16.871 --> 33:19.237
When Hook and I went to search
for the sextant,

33:19.331 --> 33:21.993
he was really taking me to find a cure.

33:23.586 --> 33:25.747
A cure for what?

33:26.839 --> 33:28.329
Dreamshade.

33:31.135 --> 33:35.003
The Lost Boys, the arrow,
you pushed me out of the way...

33:35.097 --> 33:38.134
I wasn't fast enough. I was hit.

33:40.102 --> 33:43.435
Hook was able to find a cure,
but it comes at a price.

33:44.064 --> 33:46.521
I can't leave Neverland.

33:48.986 --> 33:50.772
If I do, I'll die.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.234
(RUMBLING)

34:29.068 --> 34:30.103
You okay?

34:30.819 --> 34:32.810
Yeah. But Henry...

34:32.905 --> 34:36.113
It's okay. We're gonna take care of him.
Just need to get you out of there first.

34:40.537 --> 34:42.243
NEAL: Emma. Emma! Emma!

34:44.250 --> 34:45.865
You know that's not how this works.

34:49.838 --> 34:50.873
(SlGHS)

34:50.965 --> 34:52.375
It's okay.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.126
You can tell me anything.

35:00.808 --> 35:04.847
When I heard you might be here,
that you might still be alive,

35:05.771 --> 35:08.763
I knew I should be happy, but I wasn't.

35:08.857 --> 35:11.599
l was terrified.

35:11.694 --> 35:13.685
And I didn't understand why until now.

35:16.949 --> 35:20.112
From the moment I saw you
in New York,

35:20.202 --> 35:24.491
the instant you
stepped back into my life,

35:27.835 --> 35:30.167
I knew I never stopped loving you.

35:32.298 --> 35:35.040
And before I even had a chance
to take a breath,

35:35.134 --> 35:36.419
I lost you once more.

35:36.510 --> 35:38.671
And all that pain that I had
pushed down for all those years,

35:38.762 --> 35:42.471
itjust came rushing back.

35:44.268 --> 35:47.760
And I didn't know
if I could go through it again.

35:49.231 --> 35:52.348
I love you. I probably always will.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.113
But my secret

36:00.826 --> 36:04.318
is that l was hoping
that this was a trick. (SOBBING)

36:06.749 --> 36:08.660
l was hoping you were dead.

36:09.877 --> 36:12.493
Because it would be easier for me
to put you behind me

36:13.464 --> 36:17.173
than to face all the pain
that we went through all over again.

36:40.491 --> 36:41.480
Thank you.

36:42.076 --> 36:44.067
Don't thank us yet.
We still have to save Henry.

36:44.161 --> 36:45.617
HOOK: We found your star maps.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.990
The real question is, do you know
how to get off this island?

36:48.082 --> 36:50.289
If we can find Henry, I can get us home.

36:50.876 --> 36:54.084
Then let's go get Tinker Bell,
and retrieve the boy.

36:59.218 --> 37:00.207
You all right?

37:01.053 --> 37:02.964
Yeah. I'm fine.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.220
About what I said...

37:05.307 --> 37:07.673
-Hey, Emma, it's okay.
-No, it's not.

37:08.227 --> 37:10.639
I wish I could change how I feel,
more than anything,

37:10.729 --> 37:15.098
but I can't. I'm sorry.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.057
Don't be.

37:17.152 --> 37:18.562
After everything I've put you through,

37:18.654 --> 37:21.737
you don't ever have to apologize to me
about how you feel.

37:21.824 --> 37:23.189
Hey, I'm glad you told me.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.446
l have a secret, too, Emma.

37:27.496 --> 37:30.283
I'm never going to stop fighting for you.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.542
Never.

37:40.134 --> 37:41.749
Look, I know I should've told you...

37:41.844 --> 37:44.176
Don't. Just... Not now.

37:46.932 --> 37:50.424
I'm so sorry, Snow. Are you okay?

37:50.519 --> 37:51.679
(GASPING)

37:52.855 --> 37:55.187

What?

37:59.778 --> 38:02.941
Eric. Tell him the truth.

38:03.574 --> 38:04.939
Go to him.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.285
The caravan is probably
long gone by now.

38:07.369 --> 38:08.905
And we're miles from the docks.

38:08.996 --> 38:12.739
I saw how he looked at you at the ball.
He'll wait as long as possible.

38:13.584 --> 38:15.324
You think he's still there?

38:15.419 --> 38:17.501

Oh, that? Your voice?

about telling your Prince how you feel

39:42.047 --> 39:44.459
and rejecting you

39:44.550 --> 39:47.212
is never telling him at all.

41:28.737 --> 41:32.605
It's true,

This one can.

41:36.578 --> 41:38.318
We have history together.
