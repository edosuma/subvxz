00:03.995 --> 00:10.101
â™ª MTV... â™ª

03:34.772 --> 03:36.207
Let me and the boys do that.

03:37.541 --> 03:39.210
In my pocket.
A letter. Take it.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.147
I don't want to
get blood on it.

03:48.386 --> 03:50.621
This will take months
to get there, ma'am.

03:50.621 --> 03:51.789
We should send a wire.

03:51.789 --> 03:54.525
- Can't send a wire.
- Why not?

03:54.525 --> 03:57.495
Because then
the world will know.

03:57.495 --> 03:59.597
We will ignore
that this has happened.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.566
Never speak of it
to anyone.

04:02.566 --> 04:04.101
Ma'am, I need to
get the sheriff.

04:04.101 --> 04:06.570
- Jacob said no sheriff.
- I know what he said, but he--

04:06.570 --> 04:08.639
No sheriff. No posse.

04:10.074 --> 04:13.144
Ma'am, the Livestock
Association meets twice a month.

04:13.144 --> 04:15.479
When he don't show,
they'd know anyway.

04:17.481 --> 04:19.016
I'll go in his place.

04:20.451 --> 04:21.552
Mail the letter.

04:24.755 --> 04:26.324
Yes, ma'am.

04:28.259 --> 04:29.994
You didn't ask
how he was doing.

04:31.262 --> 04:33.297
I figured you'd tell me
if you wanted me to know.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.067
He survived the night.

04:38.102 --> 04:39.236
That's a start.

04:40.338 --> 04:42.606
Now we just have to
focus on the next night.

04:45.443 --> 04:47.845
Hope's a dangerous thing,
ma'am.

04:47.845 --> 04:49.613
It tricks your mind
into seeing this world

04:49.613 --> 04:51.082
that ain't ever coming true.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.852
It's best you say goodbye to
him while you still can.

04:56.754 --> 05:00.057
No room for miracles
in your world, I see.

05:00.057 --> 05:01.926
There's room for 'em, ma'am.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.928
I just never seen
anyone wish one up.

05:26.083 --> 05:28.486
You stay here.
Keep that rifle close.

05:28.486 --> 05:30.087
Anybody ain't a friend
rides up this road,

05:30.087 --> 05:32.022
make it the last
thing they ever do.

05:32.022 --> 05:33.090
Yes, sir.

05:46.303 --> 05:48.139
Where's the team?

05:48.139 --> 05:49.507
Well, we turned 'em out.

05:51.675 --> 05:52.676
Bring them back.

06:08.793 --> 06:11.128
What's she doing?

06:11.128 --> 06:12.663
Don't know.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.008
Now I know what she's doing.

07:21.866 --> 07:24.134
How did she sleep?

07:24.134 --> 07:25.769
Didn't move.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.282
Roll over for me, honey.

07:47.358 --> 07:50.561
It's was fortunate that we
managed to get Dr. Miller sober,

07:50.561 --> 07:52.129
otherwise this straight line

07:52.129 --> 07:54.198
would have been more
like a question mark.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.135
Does my mother know?

07:59.069 --> 08:00.304
We've sent for her.

08:04.675 --> 08:07.912
Don't like this fever.
But the doctor said no aspirin.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.051
Can I run you a bath?

08:16.687 --> 08:17.888
I'll get some water.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.124
No, you don't need to
be carrying anything.

08:20.124 --> 08:22.459
I got one good arm.

10:03.288 --> 10:05.323
Why does no one speak
of this Africa?

10:05.323 --> 10:07.225
Because they
don't know it exists.

10:11.897 --> 10:13.298
And we ain't gonna tell 'em.

10:14.866 --> 10:17.936
I much prefer it
to leopards and lions.

10:17.936 --> 10:19.604
There's leopards
and lions here, too.

10:22.574 --> 10:23.942
I want to show you something.

10:26.878 --> 10:27.946
Is it better than this?

10:29.214 --> 10:30.215
It's better than this.

10:32.484 --> 10:33.618
Show me.

10:56.708 --> 10:58.910
Don't look at me.

10:58.910 --> 11:00.178
Look behind you.

12:05.343 --> 12:07.679
It seems "I want to show
you something" actually means

12:07.679 --> 12:10.115
"I've found a new
place to ravage you."

12:11.650 --> 12:13.551
You noticed that?

12:13.551 --> 12:15.120
Yes, I've detected
the pattern.

12:19.324 --> 12:20.759
Get on with it then.

12:20.759 --> 12:22.527
If you must...

12:32.070 --> 12:33.571
Promise me...

12:38.343 --> 12:39.711
it will always be this.

12:41.946 --> 12:43.181
Always an adventure.

12:44.149 --> 12:45.650
It'll never be dull...

12:48.086 --> 12:49.087
I can promise you that.

12:50.021 --> 12:51.156
Even when we're old
and frail

12:51.156 --> 12:54.359
and all the ravaging
is behind us, what then?

12:55.827 --> 12:57.996
Wheelchair races.

12:59.497 --> 13:00.899
Challenge accepted, sir.

13:00.899 --> 13:03.501
Alex.

13:03.501 --> 13:05.303
- Spencer...
- Shut up.

13:05.303 --> 13:07.806
Oh, my apologies...

13:07.806 --> 13:09.307
I have interrupted your ravaging.

13:09.307 --> 13:12.143
Please, carry on.

13:12.143 --> 13:13.812
Darlin'.

13:13.812 --> 13:14.913
Stop talking.

13:20.085 --> 13:21.219
Call me that again.

13:23.421 --> 13:25.056
Call me "Darling."

13:27.325 --> 13:28.460
Darlin'.

13:30.095 --> 13:31.096
Okay.

13:33.164 --> 13:34.566
I'll stop talking.

13:52.984 --> 13:54.252
Where should we live?

13:54.252 --> 13:55.787
I don't care.
You choose.

13:56.955 --> 13:59.391
I could live here.

13:59.391 --> 14:01.526
There will be obligatory
trips to London, I'm afraid

14:01.526 --> 14:03.928
so that my parents can
properly despise you

14:03.928 --> 14:06.731
and I can beg my
father for money.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.334
Have you ever been?

14:09.334 --> 14:11.169
I was stationed there before
I was sent to the front.

14:12.404 --> 14:15.440
Yes, the war about nothing
that cost us everything.

14:17.108 --> 14:18.476
What did it cost you?

14:18.476 --> 14:20.912
A brother.

14:20.912 --> 14:22.147
What did it cost you?

14:23.081 --> 14:26.017
Hard to define.

14:26.017 --> 14:27.152
My soul, I think.

14:29.687 --> 14:30.722
But I'm getting that back.

14:32.891 --> 14:35.460
Never underestimate
the healing powers

14:35.460 --> 14:37.295
of a good ravaging.

14:37.295 --> 14:40.298
I must warn you, sir,
one can become quite addicted.

14:40.298 --> 14:43.234
I think it best we
ration your medicine.

14:43.234 --> 14:46.304
It's for your own good, sir!

14:49.707 --> 14:51.743
I do it out of love.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.489
Look how well my plan
is working.

15:04.489 --> 15:05.623
You're so peaceful, Spencer.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.895
I'll have you wrapped
around my finger in no time.

15:10.895 --> 15:12.197
- Mm-hm?
- Uh-huh.

15:14.432 --> 15:15.467
No!

15:42.293 --> 15:43.294
Hey.

15:46.931 --> 15:48.299
They follow you?

15:48.299 --> 15:50.268
They turned back when
we got to the canyon.

15:50.268 --> 15:51.503
Nobody else made it out?

15:51.503 --> 15:53.538
We need to leave the state.

15:53.538 --> 15:54.973
We're not going anywhere.

15:54.973 --> 15:56.674
Banner, they are gonna put
together a fucking army.

15:56.674 --> 15:58.877
Let me think!

16:06.618 --> 16:09.120
We'll build a bigger army.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.456
How? There's only
three of us left.

16:11.456 --> 16:14.692
What runs this state?
Eh?

16:14.692 --> 16:18.796
It's not cattle.
It's not sheep.

16:18.796 --> 16:22.734
Gold runs the state.
And silver.

16:22.734 --> 16:24.469
We don't need
to build an army.

16:27.071 --> 16:28.306
We can borrow one.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.635
Jake Dutton is dead?

16:57.635 --> 16:59.671
Dead, sir.

17:02.807 --> 17:04.943
Dead how?

17:04.943 --> 17:06.110
Does is matter how?

17:06.110 --> 17:08.980
It matters to the law.

17:08.980 --> 17:11.783
Law? What law?
Where is the law around here?

17:11.783 --> 17:13.217
I've never seen it.

17:15.153 --> 17:18.289
His nephew running
the ranch now?

17:18.289 --> 17:20.592
Nephew's dead, and all.

17:20.592 --> 17:22.860
What Dutton is running
the ranch?

17:22.860 --> 17:24.128
The women run it.

17:24.128 --> 17:26.931
Which is to say nobody runs it.

17:26.931 --> 17:30.101
In six months I'll run it.

17:30.101 --> 17:33.137
And when you run it,
what will you do?

17:33.137 --> 17:37.609
I'll lease you the mineral
rights, if you want them.

17:38.776 --> 17:41.579
I want them.

17:41.579 --> 17:44.515
Let's talk price.

17:44.515 --> 17:47.485
We'll talk price
in six months.

17:47.485 --> 17:50.121
When you run it.

17:50.121 --> 17:52.190
Killing a king doesn't
make you a king.

17:52.190 --> 17:55.293
It makes you an assassin.

17:55.293 --> 17:58.730
And I never heard of an
assassin running anything.

17:58.730 --> 18:02.200
Where in Montana
has the most gold,

18:02.200 --> 18:06.237
the most silver,
the most coal?

18:06.237 --> 18:08.006
The Yellowstone.

18:09.474 --> 18:11.809
That's what I'm offering.

18:14.445 --> 18:17.382
- It's not yours to offer.
- I can own it.

18:17.382 --> 18:19.317
Then why don't you?

18:19.317 --> 18:21.352
I'll tell you why:

18:21.352 --> 18:24.722
because you don't have
the money to buy it

18:24.722 --> 18:27.158
and you don't have
the men to take it.

18:29.394 --> 18:31.029
So, which do you want?

18:31.029 --> 18:33.264
The money or the men?

18:33.264 --> 18:35.566
I don't care which.

18:35.566 --> 18:37.935
I'll give you the money.

18:37.935 --> 18:39.370
You find the men.

18:39.370 --> 18:41.039
And when you have it

18:41.039 --> 18:44.609
I mine where I choose,
and the lease already paid.

18:44.609 --> 18:46.811
And you run your sheep
where you want.

18:46.811 --> 18:49.113
The mountains are mine.

18:49.113 --> 18:50.682
Deal.

18:55.086 --> 18:56.788
Shake on it.

18:59.891 --> 19:01.759
Know this, Banner:

19:01.759 --> 19:05.863
if you lie to me,
if you steal from me,

19:05.863 --> 19:07.298
and I won't just kill you.

19:07.298 --> 19:09.367
I'll kill your wife.

19:09.367 --> 19:12.637
I will skin her alive,

19:12.637 --> 19:16.908
and I'll bury your children
in her fucking hide.

19:19.477 --> 19:20.812
Understood.

19:22.513 --> 19:25.783
The man needs an army.
Give him the funds for it.

20:12.891 --> 20:14.560
Come on.

20:18.197 --> 20:20.132
Some of these cattle
have different brands.

20:20.132 --> 20:21.900
We just taking
Yellowstone cattle?

20:21.900 --> 20:24.203
We're taking them all.

20:24.203 --> 20:26.205
All right, then. Woop!

20:48.861 --> 20:49.695
Where is she?

20:49.695 --> 20:51.130
She's upstairs.

20:51.130 --> 20:52.398
Take me to her.

21:06.045 --> 21:07.680
Oh.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.882
What an ordeal
you've endured.

21:12.985 --> 21:15.287
What did the doctor
say about travel?

21:15.287 --> 21:16.889
He didn't mention travel,
but I would assume--

21:16.889 --> 21:18.390
I'll send for a motor car.

21:18.390 --> 21:20.793
We'll get you to Livingston,
then on the train.

21:20.793 --> 21:24.563
Why a train?
A train to where?

21:24.563 --> 21:26.799
Back East.
To a hospital.

21:26.799 --> 21:28.067
This is no place to recover.

21:28.067 --> 21:29.735
This is no place
to be at all.

21:29.735 --> 21:31.970
What about the wedding?

21:31.970 --> 21:34.306
What wedding?

21:34.306 --> 21:35.374
My wedding.

21:38.110 --> 21:39.345
They killed your wedding

21:39.345 --> 21:40.679
when they killed your
father, sweetheart.

21:44.717 --> 21:46.285
If you still wish
to have her hand

21:46.285 --> 21:48.120
I suggest you pack your things.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.190
Any reason I had for living in
this godless place is dead.

21:51.190 --> 21:55.794
No disrespect, Mrs. Strafford,
but I ain't marrying you.

21:55.794 --> 21:56.929
Jack.

22:10.642 --> 22:13.912
I'll discipline my own nephew,
thank you very much.

22:18.784 --> 22:19.752
Where is my husband?

22:19.752 --> 22:21.553
Ice house.
I'll take you.

22:21.553 --> 22:22.821
I will find my own way.

22:28.394 --> 22:32.498
Well, it appears you have
plenty to discuss.

22:40.739 --> 22:44.176
This is your home now,
if you choose it.

22:46.111 --> 22:47.312
I choose it.

22:50.349 --> 22:53.318
I suppose you don't have
much to discuss after all.

23:22.114 --> 23:23.649
The girl wishes to stay,

23:24.850 --> 23:27.386
marry my nephew
and start her life here.

23:29.254 --> 23:31.190
I will not allow it.

23:31.190 --> 23:33.125
That is not your
decision to make.

23:33.125 --> 23:34.726
I will send a car.

23:35.861 --> 23:36.929
It will be turned away
at the gate.

23:36.929 --> 23:38.330
She is my daughter.

23:38.330 --> 23:40.866
You have no right, you have
no right to decide her fate!

23:40.866 --> 23:43.168
That is my right
and my right alone!

23:43.168 --> 23:48.073
She is free to leave, but
you are not free to take her.

23:48.073 --> 23:51.610
This is not
the Strafford Ranch,

23:51.610 --> 23:54.413
this is the Yellowstone.

23:54.413 --> 23:56.148
And you have no rights here.

24:14.766 --> 24:17.169
And another
calamity arrives.

24:20.138 --> 24:21.607
Cattle in the east camp
are gone.

24:21.607 --> 24:22.708
Gone?

24:22.708 --> 24:23.809
There's horse tracks
leading east.

24:23.809 --> 24:24.977
They'll take 'em to Wyoming

24:24.977 --> 24:26.378
and have 'em on a
train by nightfall.

24:26.378 --> 24:28.380
I'm gonna need all the boys.

24:28.380 --> 24:30.983
Jack, stop.

24:30.983 --> 24:33.151
Stop right where you are!

24:39.258 --> 24:43.695
They attack us on the field,
now they steal our cattle?

24:46.598 --> 24:49.301
Either we take this fight
to them or it's coming to us.

24:49.301 --> 24:50.502
I need a moment.

24:50.502 --> 24:52.838
- We ain't got a moment.
- I need a moment to think.

24:55.173 --> 24:56.942
I think I've earned
that right, don't you?

24:59.211 --> 25:00.579
Don't move.

25:11.590 --> 25:13.091
What would you do?

25:15.127 --> 25:18.697
Oh... Guide me, Mother Mary.
Guide me.

25:20.899 --> 25:24.102
Thieves have stolen
the cattle, but we are weak.

25:24.102 --> 25:25.871
We have no leader.

25:27.339 --> 25:29.141
You be the leader.

25:34.212 --> 25:36.114
<i>You</i> be the leader.

25:41.553 --> 25:44.389
The cattle aren't
worth another life.

25:44.389 --> 25:47.159
Can we afford to lose them?

25:47.159 --> 25:49.861
It's only lives
we can't afford to lose.

25:55.334 --> 25:56.401
No fighting...

25:58.704 --> 26:01.039
Until Spencer gets here.

26:02.407 --> 26:03.742
Let the cattle go.

26:08.547 --> 26:10.549
I had abandoned
all hope for you.

26:12.317 --> 26:14.319
Ain't gonna get rid
of me that easy.

26:18.323 --> 26:20.626
I forbid you to die.

26:20.626 --> 26:22.794
Do you understand me?

26:22.794 --> 26:24.029
I won't die.

26:26.131 --> 26:28.567
Too stubborn.

26:30.569 --> 26:31.903
Bring me Zane.

26:41.847 --> 26:43.115
We're getting them
cattle back tonight,

26:43.115 --> 26:44.182
do you hear me?

26:44.182 --> 26:46.118
We need to
leave right now, man.

26:46.118 --> 26:49.121
We're going to.
We ain't got much time.

26:49.121 --> 26:50.889
We let the cattle go.

26:52.357 --> 26:54.026
It's not worth the risk.

26:54.026 --> 26:56.128
Godammit!
That's half our herd!

26:56.128 --> 26:57.629
It's not your decision to make.

26:57.629 --> 26:59.798
He wants to speak with you.

27:11.576 --> 27:13.011
We'll wean the calves...

27:15.447 --> 27:16.715
sell the mamas.

27:19.685 --> 27:22.521
Put bulls on the heifers

27:22.521 --> 27:23.655
when they weigh
seven hun...

27:25.290 --> 27:27.726
seven hundred...

27:27.726 --> 27:30.362
That'll take care of the bank.

27:30.362 --> 27:33.865
This Creighton,
he's gonna keep coming.

27:33.865 --> 27:36.568
And when you don't show to
the livestock conference,

27:36.568 --> 27:37.969
they're all coming.

27:37.969 --> 27:40.238
Send Cara.

27:40.238 --> 27:43.141
She'll say I'm in Wyoming,

27:43.141 --> 27:45.177
hunting thieves.

27:47.179 --> 27:48.880
Let 'em stew on that
for a while.

27:51.817 --> 27:52.884
I'll tell her.

27:57.622 --> 28:00.358
You send word to Spencer?

28:03.361 --> 28:05.864
Could take a year for
him to get back here, Jake.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.669
Then a year's how long
we got to hold out.

28:28.186 --> 28:29.654
I refuse to hope.

28:30.989 --> 28:32.758
I refuse it.

28:36.161 --> 28:38.396
You brought him back.

28:38.396 --> 28:40.565
I will believe in it.

28:42.534 --> 28:43.902
I will trust it.

28:52.210 --> 28:53.712
Mrs. Dutton?

29:04.923 --> 29:07.325
<i>There are only three
answers to a prayer:</i>

29:07.325 --> 29:11.963
<i>"Yes," "not yet,"</i>

29:11.963 --> 29:15.033
<i>and "I have something else
in mind for you."</i>

29:17.102 --> 29:18.970
<i>Man's great challenge
is trusting</i>

29:18.970 --> 29:21.506
<i>"not yet" or "something else."</i>

29:22.941 --> 29:25.177
<i>And avoiding the
foolish notion of hope.</i>

29:26.945 --> 29:30.048
<i>Wishing to nothing that your
unanswered prayer is granted.</i>

29:32.184 --> 29:35.520
<i>Hope is the surrender
of authority to your fate,</i>

29:35.520 --> 29:37.756
<i>and trusting it to
the whims of the wind.</i>

29:39.257 --> 29:42.394
<i>My family does not hope.</i>

29:42.394 --> 29:44.896
<i>We fight for what
we believe until we have it</i>

29:46.264 --> 29:48.400
<i>or we are destroyed
by the pursuit.</i>

29:53.266 --> 29:58.171
Gone are the days of following
the buffalo across the prairie,

29:58.171 --> 30:03.176
burning their feces
for warmth and cooking.

30:03.176 --> 30:07.146
Gone too, are winters
of starvation and suffering.

30:07.146 --> 30:10.516
Tending God's great bounty is
the salvation of your people.

30:10.516 --> 30:13.853
It is the cornerstone
of independence.

30:13.853 --> 30:16.055
You are mastering
your sustenance

30:16.055 --> 30:19.025
rather than wandering
aimlessly in the hopes
that you stumble upon it.

30:19.792 --> 30:20.993
Heavens, girl.

30:20.993 --> 30:22.729
The fruit will rot on
the vine at this rate.

30:22.729 --> 30:24.397
It's the thorns.

30:24.397 --> 30:28.534
Jesus wore a crown of thorns
and no complaint left his lips.

30:28.534 --> 30:30.236
I'm not Jesus.

30:30.236 --> 30:33.806
No, you are not.

30:33.806 --> 30:35.675
Stop leaving the fruit
in the middle.

30:36.609 --> 30:37.677
In the middle.

30:39.479 --> 30:42.048
Stop worrying about the thorns
and worry about me!

30:42.048 --> 30:43.416
Ah!

30:44.784 --> 30:46.119
Oh!

30:48.688 --> 30:49.689
Oh!

31:08.141 --> 31:10.777
Your savage spirit will
be the death of you, girl.

31:12.245 --> 31:13.246
You are a savage.

31:14.147 --> 31:16.115
Savage.

31:16.115 --> 31:19.485
A vile reminder
of how your people lived,

31:19.485 --> 31:21.487
far from the shadow of God.

31:21.487 --> 31:24.991
No better than the wolf pack,
and like the wolf,

31:24.991 --> 31:27.727
you must become a dog,

31:27.727 --> 31:30.963
or you will be hunted
out of existence.

31:30.963 --> 31:34.467
I am trying to save you, child,

31:34.467 --> 31:39.205
from that most heinous
of enemies: yourself.

31:39.205 --> 31:41.741
You are your own worst enemy.

31:41.741 --> 31:44.343
You must be cleansed, child.

31:44.343 --> 31:48.448
You must be bathed
in the blood to be saved.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.516
But you must want it.

31:50.516 --> 31:52.385
You must want to be saved.

31:54.287 --> 31:55.655
Do you want it?

31:58.724 --> 32:00.927
I don't want
anything you have.

32:07.433 --> 32:08.868
Do you want to be saved?

32:08.868 --> 32:10.369
No, I don't.

32:17.009 --> 32:18.110
She has the devil in her!

32:27.220 --> 32:30.056
Oh, not to worry.
I have more.

32:34.393 --> 32:39.298
Okay. Okay. Okay...

32:41.400 --> 32:43.369
Okay, what?

32:44.570 --> 32:46.005
Save me.

32:52.912 --> 32:56.449
And I saw an angel
come down from Heaven...

32:56.449 --> 32:57.750
the old serpent,

32:57.750 --> 33:01.654
and cast him into
the bottomless pit,

33:01.654 --> 33:03.623
shut him up and
set a seal upon him.

33:03.623 --> 33:07.827
A stone was cast into
the pool of fire and brimstone

33:07.827 --> 33:11.364
where both the beast
and the false prophet

33:11.364 --> 33:13.833
shall be tormented
day and night

33:13.833 --> 33:17.169
forever and ever...

33:18.905 --> 33:21.173
Be sober and watch,

33:21.173 --> 33:27.647
because your adversary the devil
is a roaming lion...

33:27.647 --> 33:29.615
He that hath committed sin
is of the devil,

33:29.615 --> 33:30.516
for the devil sinneth
from the beginning...

33:35.221 --> 33:37.690
...in purify your heart

33:37.690 --> 33:41.360
be subject therefore to God
and resist the devil

33:41.360 --> 33:43.563
and he shall fly from you.

33:43.563 --> 33:47.133
Draw nigh to God
and he shall...

35:16.222 --> 35:17.289
You're leaving?

35:17.289 --> 35:19.725
Come with me.

35:19.725 --> 35:21.560
They'll find us.

35:21.560 --> 35:22.862
And put us in jail.

35:22.862 --> 35:25.531
Show me the law that says
we must sign on

35:25.531 --> 35:27.967
to be a servant
or get a beating.

35:58.431 --> 36:00.266
I'm taking your Bible.

36:00.266 --> 36:02.902
Sister Mary
will beat me silly.

36:02.902 --> 36:04.837
No, she won't.

36:12.845 --> 36:14.280
Where are you going?

36:14.880 --> 36:15.915
Home.

36:20.853 --> 36:22.621
What are you doing?

36:25.224 --> 36:26.859
Making war.

38:57.042 --> 38:58.377
Is it true?

38:58.377 --> 39:00.145
I don't know if it's
true--I'll find out.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.782
Find out just now.

39:03.782 --> 39:05.084
The wife is here.

39:05.084 --> 39:07.286
Alone?

39:07.286 --> 39:09.588
Bunch of cowboys.

39:09.588 --> 39:13.659
But no Jake or John
or the young 'un?

39:13.659 --> 39:15.194
No.

39:25.304 --> 39:26.372
There she is.

39:35.614 --> 39:36.849
Ma'am.

39:38.117 --> 39:39.585
Where's Jacob?

39:39.585 --> 39:41.587
I shall address
that very thing.

39:47.893 --> 39:52.398
Cattle thieves, that plague
upon Montana's ranches

39:52.398 --> 39:54.733
that is worse than
drought or locust,

39:54.733 --> 39:57.937
has struck our ranch as well.

39:57.937 --> 40:01.740
So my husband has
taken to Wyoming

40:01.740 --> 40:02.942
in search of the cattle,

40:02.942 --> 40:05.344
many of which belong
to other members

40:05.344 --> 40:08.113
of this association:
you, Mr. Brewster,

40:08.113 --> 40:10.316
you as well, Mr. Hoburn.

40:10.316 --> 40:12.718
And you, Mr. Grant.

40:12.718 --> 40:17.990
It also appears that these
thieves are murderers,

40:17.990 --> 40:21.060
killing Bob Strafford
in cold blood.

40:22.328 --> 40:23.662
Lynch 'em!

40:24.964 --> 40:27.833
The response must
be forceful,

40:27.833 --> 40:29.902
but lawful.

40:29.902 --> 40:32.638
One mob begets another.

40:32.638 --> 40:36.875
It is time this agency has
the authority to make arrests

40:36.875 --> 40:40.279
and have jurisdiction over
the entire state.

40:40.279 --> 40:42.314
The power to issue warrants,

40:42.314 --> 40:45.985
and to prosecute offenders
of lease violations,

40:45.985 --> 40:48.187
as well as
the theft of livestock.

40:48.187 --> 40:50.189
So word has been sent
to the Governor.

40:50.189 --> 40:54.460
On behalf of my husband,
I will ask members

40:54.460 --> 41:00.199
of this association to vote for
the creation of a police force,

41:00.199 --> 41:02.568
as my husband has asked
the Governor

41:02.568 --> 41:05.137
to grant the authority
I have just stated.

41:05.137 --> 41:08.774
I ask now for a vote
in favor of the creation

41:08.774 --> 41:10.976
of the police force
so empowered by the state

41:10.976 --> 41:13.812
to execute the duties
listed hereof.

41:15.214 --> 41:17.082
All in favor say "aye."

41:23.889 --> 41:25.224
You don't have the authority

41:25.224 --> 41:27.426
to ask for a vote
before the members.

41:27.426 --> 41:29.228
- Yeah.
- That's right.

41:29.228 --> 41:31.530
The authority
is written and signed

41:31.530 --> 41:34.166
by the Commissioner
of this Association.

41:34.166 --> 41:36.869
Can you attest to that being
the signature of Jacob Dutton?

41:39.805 --> 41:40.806
I can.

41:42.241 --> 41:44.877
All those in favor say "aye."

41:44.877 --> 41:46.979
Aye!

41:46.979 --> 41:48.680
All opposed.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.115
Nay.

41:52.584 --> 41:55.487
The ayes have it.
Proposal is approved.

41:55.487 --> 41:58.257
Dues will increase
twenty-seven dollars per annum

41:58.257 --> 42:00.159
for officer salaries
and supplies.

42:00.159 --> 42:03.796
Meeting is adjourned, we will
convene again in one month.

42:03.796 --> 42:05.397
Nah, it's in two weeks.

42:05.397 --> 42:06.965
One month, I say.

42:09.501 --> 42:10.936
Meeting is adjourned.

42:11.737 --> 42:12.771
Thank you, gentlemen.

42:21.613 --> 42:23.916
That's not what Jake said.

42:23.916 --> 42:25.517
I just thought of it
on the way over.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.220
Well, how did you
get him to sign it?

42:28.220 --> 42:29.655
I signed it.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.534
You're a liar.

42:44.503 --> 42:46.338
You're a fucking liar, woman.

42:46.338 --> 42:48.340
I'll kill you where
you fucking stand.

42:51.110 --> 42:53.412
- A liar.
- Aye.

42:53.412 --> 42:56.014
Care to prove it?
Shall we go back inside...

42:56.014 --> 42:58.784
and you can tell
the sheriff the truth.

42:58.784 --> 43:02.054
He's not in Wyoming.

43:02.054 --> 43:03.522
He's not anywhere.

43:03.522 --> 43:05.824
How would you know?

43:05.824 --> 43:07.860
How would you know where he is?

43:10.395 --> 43:13.665
No bank will let
a woman carry a note.

43:14.967 --> 43:18.504
No government will transfer
a lease for her, either.

43:18.504 --> 43:22.074
Your little charade
can only last so long.

43:27.546 --> 43:30.115
When my charade
is over, so are you.

43:31.116 --> 43:32.718
Men kill with
bullets or a noose,

43:32.718 --> 43:34.720
which is to say
men kill quick.

43:34.720 --> 43:36.755
Your fight is with me, now.

43:36.755 --> 43:38.924
I kill much slower.

43:48.100 --> 43:50.202
You don't have
the army for this fight.

43:52.070 --> 43:54.339
Or the money.

43:54.339 --> 43:55.741
I have both.

43:55.741 --> 43:58.377
I can't wait for you
to meet my nephew.

43:58.377 --> 44:01.146
We've met.

44:01.146 --> 44:03.348
The boy doesn't impress.

44:03.348 --> 44:04.783
Not that one.

44:37.377 --> 44:39.145
They come rolled now,
you know.

44:39.145 --> 44:40.480
That's what
they gave us in the war.

44:43.349 --> 44:44.884
I won't smoke those now.

44:49.489 --> 44:50.824
Spencer...

44:53.893 --> 44:54.994
What are these?

44:58.398 --> 44:59.799
Cara Dutton.

45:02.135 --> 45:03.903
Something you forgot
to tell me?

45:06.072 --> 45:07.640
That's my aunt.

45:10.677 --> 45:12.011
Why won't you read them?

45:12.879 --> 45:13.913
Hard to explain.

45:14.380 --> 45:15.915
Try.

45:25.358 --> 45:26.493
War's not living.

45:28.995 --> 45:30.497
War is...

45:33.833 --> 45:38.404
If insanity was a thing you
could touch, that's what war is.

45:41.241 --> 45:43.843
A letter is a window out
of that hell for a minute.

45:44.711 --> 45:45.912
But it's a double-edged sword.

45:47.647 --> 45:51.484
Missing home and dreaming
has killed more soldiers.

45:54.621 --> 45:56.055
You want to eat
a bullet in battle,

45:56.055 --> 45:57.423
you start wishing for a letter.

46:00.994 --> 46:02.529
We had so many letters
to dead men

46:02.529 --> 46:05.365
we bundled them up
and made furniture out of 'em.

46:05.365 --> 46:08.201
I credit not reading 'em
for keeping me alive.

46:08.201 --> 46:10.837
Then the war's over and
I got two years' worth of 'em.

46:12.572 --> 46:13.973
Then I felt guilty.

46:17.544 --> 46:19.445
Now I don't
know what I feel. I...

46:21.047 --> 46:23.383
I spend most of my time
trying not to.

46:27.120 --> 46:28.655
Till you.

46:35.595 --> 46:38.398
There's something
you should know about me.

46:38.398 --> 46:41.034
I'm a very jealous lover.

46:41.034 --> 46:43.036
I will not share you
with your demons.

46:46.239 --> 46:48.041
So we must find them...

46:49.209 --> 46:51.311
and chase them all away.

47:03.289 --> 47:05.024
Let's get started, shall we?

47:10.196 --> 47:12.665
No one said demon
chasing must be done sober.

47:13.967 --> 47:15.201
Come on.

47:23.776 --> 47:25.411
Shall we choose randomly
or go in order?

47:25.411 --> 47:28.348
I guess if we're going to do it,
we should do it in order...

47:40.360 --> 47:41.895
"My Dearest Spencer...

47:46.699 --> 47:48.534
"News of the German
Spring Offensive

47:48.534 --> 47:52.038
"has reached our little
valley in Montana,

47:52.038 --> 47:54.540
"and the stories horrify...

47:54.540 --> 47:56.509
"Jacob tells me the bulk
of the German army

47:56.509 --> 47:59.479
"charged your division
and your company

47:59.479 --> 48:01.981
was given the grim honor
of holding the flank..."

48:08.054 --> 48:10.056
<i>"I've read tales
of terrible machines</i>

48:10.056 --> 48:14.060
<i>"with belts for tires
and canons that rotate...</i>

48:16.095 --> 48:20.767
<i>"Airplanes with bombs and guns
and it robs me of sleep.</i>

48:25.705 --> 48:28.908
<i>"The Brigadier General
writes of your bravery.</i>

48:28.908 --> 48:31.277
<i>"Of your unflinching resolve.</i>

48:43.289 --> 48:45.091
<i>"I think only of the
wild young man</i>

48:45.091 --> 48:48.695
<i>"who would rather chase
cattle than gather them.</i>

48:50.496 --> 48:54.133
<i>"And race the horses until they
were ruined for honest work.</i>

48:55.301 --> 48:58.771
<i>"I wait desperately
for that boy to return.</i>

49:00.073 --> 49:03.076
<i>"And I pray you bring
that beautiful smile with you.</i>

49:03.076 --> 49:07.280
<i>It is my sunrise, and I miss
it with all my heart."</i>

49:14.387 --> 49:16.756
"I cling to every
memory of you,

49:16.756 --> 49:19.359
"waiting for you to come home,

49:19.359 --> 49:24.197
where we shall make
countless more. Cara."

49:29.369 --> 49:31.504
I'm sorry, I didn't...

49:32.405 --> 49:34.107
This was a mistake.
I'm sorry.

49:36.976 --> 49:39.912
Keep going.

49:39.912 --> 49:40.980
Read the next one.

49:41.981 --> 49:43.149
Okay.

49:52.291 --> 49:54.994
"So, Jack said,
'Who needs a horse!'

49:54.994 --> 49:56.963
"And he yanks his
saddle from the bronc

49:56.963 --> 50:00.767
"and marches it over to
the milk cow.

50:00.767 --> 50:04.270
"Gladys ran straight to the
water trough and leapt into it,

50:04.270 --> 50:06.873
"trapping Jack underwater
until Jacob and John

50:06.873 --> 50:09.675
"roped the beast and
managed to free Jack

50:09.675 --> 50:13.179
"from a death
by cow drowning.

50:13.179 --> 50:14.747
I can't wait to meet him.

50:14.747 --> 50:16.649
He's a little tornado.

50:16.649 --> 50:19.419
Runs in the family, I see.

50:19.419 --> 50:20.453
Your father's side?

50:20.453 --> 50:23.189
Crazy runs in both sides.

50:23.189 --> 50:24.657
I'm double-bred, I'm afraid.

50:24.657 --> 50:27.360
So am I.

50:27.360 --> 50:29.829
Our children are going
be absolutely mad.

50:29.829 --> 50:31.431
We should consider adopting.

50:32.565 --> 50:35.601
Mm. I can't wait for
the next letter.

50:38.871 --> 50:42.942
"Alas, the baby
did not survive.

50:44.143 --> 50:47.780
"Emma was shattered,
but John stayed by her side

50:47.780 --> 50:51.617
"all day until she dared
to face the sun again.

50:53.920 --> 50:55.288
"She's too old to try again.

50:57.457 --> 50:59.559
"God wished her only one.

50:59.559 --> 51:01.360
But what a special
one he is."

51:06.265 --> 51:08.668
"It was the worst
winter since '83,

51:08.668 --> 51:11.571
"when your parents
first arrived here.

51:11.571 --> 51:15.174
"We found a snow drift with
a hundred head of cattle

51:15.174 --> 51:18.778
frozen solid,
but standing upright."

51:20.780 --> 51:23.716
"She's a lovely girl,
with giant eyes

51:23.716 --> 51:26.219
"and hair the color of straw

51:26.219 --> 51:29.489
"and she leads Jack around
on an invisible leash.

51:29.489 --> 51:33.726
"Watching them fawn over each
other is my favorite hobby.

51:33.726 --> 51:35.928
"I've forsaken
knitting altogether,

51:35.928 --> 51:37.363
and give it all my attention."

52:20.773 --> 52:22.041
Spencer.

52:23.309 --> 52:24.210
What?

52:24.210 --> 52:26.012
You need to read this.

52:26.646 --> 52:27.780
Tomorrow.

52:28.814 --> 52:29.815
Read it.

52:34.487 --> 52:35.721
What does it say?

52:43.596 --> 52:45.064
You need to read it.

52:47.466 --> 52:48.501
You read it.

52:53.673 --> 52:55.908
"Spencer...

52:55.908 --> 52:58.444
"Your brother has been killed.

53:02.615 --> 53:05.818
"By the time you
receive this letter,

53:05.818 --> 53:09.455
I suppose your uncle
has been killed as well."

53:13.659 --> 53:15.561
"Your nephew
has been wounded...

53:18.831 --> 53:23.102
"This ranch and your
legacy are in peril.

53:26.405 --> 53:30.743
"War has descended upon
this place and your family.

53:34.280 --> 53:36.983
"Whatever war you fight
within yourself must wait.

53:39.785 --> 53:41.721
You must come home
and fight this one."

53:51.797 --> 53:53.032
What's the date?

53:54.667 --> 53:55.968
The date?

53:55.968 --> 53:57.503
Of the letter.
When was it written?

54:02.608 --> 54:04.410
Three months ago.
