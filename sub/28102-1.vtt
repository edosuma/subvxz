00:37.209 --> 00:39.913
You want
me to do what with this?

00:39.936 --> 00:42.709
You heard what I said.

00:42.732 --> 00:43.871
Don't defy me.

00:44.837 --> 00:47.771
Just do... as I say.

00:48.910 --> 00:50.648
Yes, madam, it's just that...

00:50.671 --> 00:52.926
Stop complaining.

00:52.949 --> 00:56.343
You want to keep the position
I have given you here,

00:56.366 --> 00:59.657
then you have to
prove your worth.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.693
Okay, I just don't understand

01:01.716 --> 01:04.075
how this is going
to help us find her.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.732
I mean, he doesn't
know anything.

01:05.755 --> 01:08.079
It's much more than that.

01:08.102 --> 01:11.979
I can easily find
another chair for you.

01:12.002 --> 01:13.360
Can I just say something here?

01:13.383 --> 01:15.834
You have no right to speak.

01:17.387 --> 01:21.874
Besides, you should be grateful.

01:22.737 --> 01:27.328
You get to be my first guest...

01:28.467 --> 01:30.814
Clover.

01:32.402 --> 01:37.027
From now on, this
camp is officially...

01:37.994 --> 01:42.930
...open for business.

02:01.466 --> 02:02.340
Ooh.

02:02.363 --> 02:03.134
Whoa!

02:55.899 --> 02:58.224
A longstanding feud that
has come to the forefront

02:58.247 --> 03:00.295
of popular discussion
in recent months

03:00.318 --> 03:02.089
has escalated dramatically.

03:02.112 --> 03:05.369
Unprovoked violence and riots
have become commonplace.

03:05.392 --> 03:06.991
The world sees a
need for change,

03:07.014 --> 03:09.511
but is still unclear on the
proper course of action.

03:09.534 --> 03:11.340
President Shump has
consistently spoken out

03:11.363 --> 03:13.158
against the segregation

03:13.262 --> 03:15.885
and urged for an increase in
unity among our great states.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.554
I'm here with a leading

03:18.577 --> 03:20.729
non-human rights
activist, The Wicked One.

03:20.752 --> 03:22.248
Is there anything
you'd like to say

03:22.271 --> 03:24.204
about the president's
speech last night?

03:26.033 --> 03:28.185
Do you think that our
country's hopes rely on

03:28.208 --> 03:30.762
an openness to
compromise on all sides?

03:33.730 --> 03:35.709
As you can see, this is
a very serious issue...

03:35.732 --> 03:37.769
Fuck her right in the pussy!

04:27.439 --> 04:28.440
Oh.

04:29.476 --> 04:31.213
Stan!
Jesus!

04:31.236 --> 04:32.732
Nick!

04:32.755 --> 04:36.598
Is it so hard to say, excuse
me, Dr. Cole, occasionally?

04:36.621 --> 04:39.842
I mean, what, did somebody
piss on your shirt?

04:39.865 --> 04:41.396
No, no, look, okay,
my fiancee and I,

04:41.419 --> 04:42.983
we've been having a
couple of problems lately,

04:43.006 --> 04:45.607
and she thinks that I'm hiding
something from her, which...

04:45.630 --> 04:47.367
Well, you're
cheating on her, right?

04:47.390 --> 04:48.575
No, I would never do that.

04:48.598 --> 04:49.507
I love her.

04:49.530 --> 04:51.060
All right, what
do you want from me?

04:51.083 --> 04:52.993
Okay, so, I've had a
lot on my mind recently,

04:53.016 --> 04:55.133
and I accidentally scheduled
an AA meeting tonight

04:55.156 --> 04:57.446
that I can't make.

04:57.469 --> 04:58.378
You...

04:58.401 --> 04:59.517
You gotta cover it for me.

04:59.540 --> 05:01.208
Oh.
They're really good people!

05:01.231 --> 05:02.486
You could really,
really help them,

05:02.509 --> 05:04.039
and you might even
learn something.

05:04.062 --> 05:05.316
Oh, I know plenty.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.766
Okay, look, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

05:06.789 --> 05:10.528
I'm sorry, look, I can't
risk going to this meeting.

05:10.551 --> 05:13.600
Look, if you cover this for me,

05:13.623 --> 05:15.499
I'll cover your
meetings for a week.

05:15.522 --> 05:17.224
A week?
A week.

05:17.247 --> 05:19.848
You can catch a lot
of fish in a week.

05:19.871 --> 05:21.505
Well, it has been a while.

05:21.528 --> 05:22.368
Oh, thank you so much.

05:22.391 --> 05:23.886
Thank you so, so much.

05:23.909 --> 05:25.060
Just so you know, it's kind
of a weird group of people,

05:25.083 --> 05:26.095
so it's not actually here.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.269
What, what, what, what?!

05:27.292 --> 05:28.477
No, it's fine!

05:28.500 --> 05:30.790
It's 8:15, Hopkins Hall,
I'll text you the address.

05:30.813 --> 05:32.309
You'll be wonderful,
you'll be fine!

05:32.332 --> 05:33.379
I love you!

05:33.402 --> 05:34.587
You'll be great!

05:34.610 --> 05:35.438
Beautiful!

05:52.490 --> 05:55.193
Excuse me, you know
where the AA meeting is?

05:55.216 --> 05:56.747
You one of them?

05:56.770 --> 05:59.807
The basement's the right
place for your type.

06:01.947 --> 06:05.848
You know, prohibition
ended in the '30s, pal.

06:32.633 --> 06:33.462
Hi.

06:34.739 --> 06:36.649
And you are Mister...

06:36.672 --> 06:37.500
Johnny.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.410
Johnny.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.365
Hi, Johnny.

06:41.470 --> 06:42.620
Who are you?

06:42.643 --> 06:43.966
Oh, well, I'm glad you asked.

06:43.989 --> 06:47.337
Everybody, would you
please take a seat?

06:49.443 --> 06:50.237
Hi, I'm...

06:52.481 --> 06:54.287
Yeah, anywhere,
just sit anywhere.

06:54.310 --> 06:58.245
I'm Dr. Stanley Cole,
and I am an alcoholic.

06:59.557 --> 07:02.387
Hello, Dr. Cole
Hello, Dr. Stanley Cole.

07:03.837 --> 07:06.472
I am substituting for Mr. Lane

07:06.495 --> 07:08.704
who has a family emergency.

07:11.327 --> 07:13.651
Why don't we go around
and introduce ourselves?

07:13.674 --> 07:16.102
You know Johnny, and...

07:16.125 --> 07:17.275
I'm Catherine.

07:17.298 --> 07:18.299
Catherine.

07:20.750 --> 07:21.866
Timothy.

07:21.889 --> 07:22.798
Nice to meet you.

07:22.821 --> 07:24.444
Could you speak up, please?

07:25.134 --> 07:25.974
Tim.

07:25.997 --> 07:27.113
His name's Tim.

07:27.136 --> 07:28.563
Thanks, Dave.

07:28.586 --> 07:30.277
Higgins, Dave.

07:31.658 --> 07:33.084
Hi, I'm new.

07:33.107 --> 07:36.007
I'm Ted, it's my
first time here.

07:36.663 --> 07:37.917
I'm Anne.

07:37.940 --> 07:38.918
Annie.

07:38.941 --> 07:40.264
Anne Marie.

07:40.287 --> 07:42.531
Whichever you'd prefer.

07:43.014 --> 07:44.371
Annie.

07:44.394 --> 07:45.395
I'm Bella.

07:47.708 --> 07:50.067
I bet you have a lovely smile.

07:50.090 --> 07:52.449
Could you show me your teeth?

07:52.472 --> 07:55.060
Always with the teeth, Bella.

07:56.545 --> 07:57.730
Okay.

07:57.753 --> 07:59.870
I don't know how we
work the program here,

07:59.893 --> 08:00.687
but um...

08:01.964 --> 08:03.448
...just start the sharing?

08:04.725 --> 08:06.635
Anybody have a burning desire,

08:06.658 --> 08:08.810
something that might have
took them off the rails

08:08.833 --> 08:10.351
a little bit this week?

08:11.007 --> 08:12.250
Yes, Catherine.

08:14.977 --> 08:17.128
I was tempted at the
supermarket the other day.

08:20.983 --> 08:22.962
I was in the frozen
food section,

08:22.985 --> 08:26.920
checking out the TV
dinners, when there he was.

08:28.473 --> 08:31.315
It was so adorable how he climbed
to the top of the fridge,

08:31.338 --> 08:33.972
with his sexy red
beard, cute freckles,

08:33.996 --> 08:38.241
great style, and this
perfect little ass.

08:39.207 --> 08:40.566
Ooh, that's what I like to hear.

08:40.589 --> 08:41.946
Tell me more about that
perfect little ass.

08:41.969 --> 08:43.809
Oh, my gosh, it was amazing.

08:43.832 --> 08:47.020
Yeah, you crosstalk here?

08:47.043 --> 08:47.849
Yeah.

08:47.872 --> 08:49.057
Oh, okay.

08:49.080 --> 08:49.908
Go on.

08:51.082 --> 08:53.510
Anyway, just as he
reached the six-pack,

08:53.533 --> 08:54.959
he lost his balance.

08:57.295 --> 08:59.067
I mean, I don't
know how he did it,

08:59.090 --> 09:02.369
but somehow he managed
to save the beer.

09:06.615 --> 09:08.076
I felt bad for not helping him,

09:08.099 --> 09:11.999
but I knew I couldn't
'cause I'd be too tempted.

09:13.276 --> 09:15.324
Well, thank you for sharing.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.348
I'm Irish.

09:24.633 --> 09:25.668
Uh?

09:27.601 --> 09:28.510
Timmy.

09:28.533 --> 09:32.710
Timmy, anything you wanna say?

09:34.919 --> 09:37.519
You know, someone
once said to me,

09:37.542 --> 09:39.659
you know, don't wait till you
know what you're talking about

09:39.682 --> 09:44.664
before you open your mouth, or
you'll never get the program.

09:44.687 --> 09:46.758
You, anything, Tim.

09:51.694 --> 09:54.501
I can't get her outta my mind.

09:54.524 --> 09:55.525
Her or it?

09:58.287 --> 10:00.461
Are you working the steps?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.235
What step are you on?

10:04.258 --> 10:06.030
The fourth.

10:06.053 --> 10:09.482
That's usually where
I get my best angle.

10:09.505 --> 10:11.173
What, I don't understand.

10:11.196 --> 10:13.371
You're drinking on a step?

10:14.510 --> 10:16.098
I'm watching her.

10:50.719 --> 10:55.045
Thinking of her, loving
her, cherishing her,

10:55.068 --> 10:57.047
I masturbate a little bit,

10:57.070 --> 11:00.844
imagining our lives together,
what our kids would look like,

11:00.867 --> 11:02.431
I masturbate some more.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.848
Oh, this might not
be the right meeting

11:04.871 --> 11:07.367
for you to cover that.

11:07.390 --> 11:09.024
Oh, no, no, no,
he's in the right one.

11:09.047 --> 11:10.508
Now, let me finish.

11:10.531 --> 11:11.820
Er, I mean, him finish.

11:11.843 --> 11:15.467
Could you go back to the
masturbating part again?

11:16.814 --> 11:18.585
She's weird.

11:18.608 --> 11:20.760
Parents are probably weird too.

11:20.783 --> 11:22.785
Maybe they get in on it?

12:22.051 --> 12:23.225
Okay.

12:25.261 --> 12:27.965
Oh, sorry.

12:27.988 --> 12:28.817
Just...

12:31.440 --> 12:35.041
Oh, why don't we take this moment
for the seventh tradition.

12:35.064 --> 12:37.354
Just pass the hat, would you?

12:37.377 --> 12:39.206
And I gotta take this.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.905
What the hell have you
gotten me into here?

12:50.908 --> 12:52.818
What, you got
something in your ass,

12:52.841 --> 12:55.153
and she finds it attractive?

12:58.605 --> 12:59.825
Well, I don't know.

12:59.848 --> 13:03.760
I mean, if, you know,
it's all right with you,

13:03.783 --> 13:07.211
in the long run, I don't know,
maybe go for it, I guess.

13:07.234 --> 13:08.557
What? I can't hear you.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.111
You're breaking up here.

13:10.134 --> 13:12.412
Let me call you right back.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.016
Okay, who's next?

13:31.224 --> 13:33.065
Well...
Alright.

13:33.088 --> 13:36.620
Story you've all
been waiting for...

13:36.643 --> 13:37.863
Mine.

13:37.886 --> 13:39.174
It all started when I was a kid

13:39.197 --> 13:41.798
and I lost my first tooth.

14:03.118 --> 14:06.259
And then I fell asleep until...

14:14.129 --> 14:16.303
Go to sleep, little one.

14:27.487 --> 14:28.315
Shh.

14:50.993 --> 14:53.041
You wouldn't believe
the stiffy I had.

14:53.064 --> 14:54.629
Oh.

14:54.652 --> 14:55.837
Weren't you nine?

14:55.860 --> 14:57.011
Yeah.

14:57.034 --> 14:57.897
Inches.

14:59.415 --> 15:03.350
Oh, that's right, I forgot,
you like them small.

15:04.524 --> 15:07.734
Anyway, back to the
feature presentation.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.817
At this point, I had
lost all the teeth

15:10.840 --> 15:13.441
that I was gonna lose, and I
hadn't even been able to catch

15:13.464 --> 15:15.961
a single glimpse of her
elusive beauty again,

15:15.984 --> 15:18.193
so I started scheming.

15:25.407 --> 15:28.283
As you can see, that
plan fell through.

15:28.306 --> 15:32.069
I tried again, only this
time, more recently.

15:40.353 --> 15:41.181
Three.

15:42.872 --> 15:43.701
Two.

15:45.565 --> 15:46.393
One.

15:50.052 --> 15:51.502
Oh, yeah!

15:56.714 --> 15:59.866
You pulled out
your two front teeth?

15:59.889 --> 16:04.733
I mean, you got rid of
your two most visible teeth

16:04.756 --> 16:09.761
in order to make somebody
who likes teeth like you?

16:11.039 --> 16:14.145
It's kinda dysfunctional,
don't you think?

16:17.459 --> 16:19.645
So using that tooth as bait,

16:19.668 --> 16:21.302
I set the ultimate fairy trap.

16:43.726 --> 16:46.902
I almost missed my
opportunity when...

17:12.685 --> 17:14.217
My love!

17:14.240 --> 17:15.079
I got you!

17:15.103 --> 17:16.184
I finally got you!

17:21.626 --> 17:23.214
What, my love?

17:25.872 --> 17:26.700
Baby?

17:38.160 --> 17:40.335
Think you broke your wand.

17:41.957 --> 17:45.547
Don't worry, the
magic's not in this one.

17:50.172 --> 17:51.070
Oh, shit.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.810
You know there's more
than one Tooth Fairy, Dave.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.294
No, there isn't!

17:57.317 --> 18:00.125
Everyone says the Tooth
Fairy, not a Tooth Fairy,

18:00.148 --> 18:01.367
so why don't you shut up

18:01.390 --> 18:04.531
and learn how to speak
English, you dry humper.

18:05.705 --> 18:08.190
Bella, what brings you here?

18:10.468 --> 18:12.206
Vampires.

18:12.229 --> 18:14.070
They really make my blood boil.

18:14.093 --> 18:18.856
Ghosts give me goosebumps,
and I give them goose humps.

18:45.745 --> 18:47.172
Hold on.

18:47.195 --> 18:49.864
I didn't even know
this was a problem.

18:49.887 --> 18:51.797
Neither did I.

18:51.820 --> 18:53.212
Maybe if I would've known,

18:53.235 --> 18:56.181
I could've gotten my brother
the proper treatment.

18:56.204 --> 18:57.941
Treatment?

18:57.964 --> 18:59.839
That's why I'm here,

18:59.862 --> 19:03.280
to share his story and
help whoever I can.

19:05.351 --> 19:07.364
You see, my brother's obsession

19:07.387 --> 19:09.907
turned out to be his downfall.

19:11.357 --> 19:15.027
Ned was the kinda guy who
was fascinated by nature.

19:15.050 --> 19:18.260
He loved everything
and anything in it...

19:19.227 --> 19:21.620
...animals in particular.

19:21.643 --> 19:23.449
There was only one thing

19:23.472 --> 19:26.245
that my brother Ned
loved more than his pets,

19:26.268 --> 19:30.790
and that was their ability
to grow hair, lots of hair.

19:34.242 --> 19:39.212
Ned was bald, very bald, like
all over everywhere bald.

19:42.077 --> 19:46.576
His envy of hair developed
into an unhealthy attraction.

19:46.599 --> 19:49.671
That's why his most
prized possession...

19:51.051 --> 19:53.859
was the hairiest of them all.

20:03.857 --> 20:04.686
Hush.

20:05.825 --> 20:08.391
Hush, my love, relax.

20:08.414 --> 20:09.944
Relax, my love.

20:12.521 --> 20:15.973
I want this time to
be really meaningful.

20:17.112 --> 20:20.288
I want you to be
able to touch me...

20:22.255 --> 20:24.326
as I touch you,

20:25.983 --> 20:27.502
to feel me,

20:29.987 --> 20:31.540
to know me,

20:35.682 --> 20:37.443
to be inside me.

20:42.931 --> 20:47.867
Now, why don't you show
me the missing link?

20:54.632 --> 20:55.840
Oh, yes!

20:56.358 --> 20:57.186
Yes!

21:05.678 --> 21:08.899
<i>♪ I'll be buried in the chains</i>

21:08.922 --> 21:11.419
<i>♪ Buried in the chains of love</i>

21:11.442 --> 21:15.630
<i>♪ I'll be forever
buried in the chains ♪</i>

21:15.653 --> 21:18.081
<i>♪ Buried in the chains of love</i>

21:18.104 --> 21:21.912
<i>♪ And I can't stand the face</i>

21:21.935 --> 21:25.261
<i>♪ That I see in my reflection</i>

21:25.284 --> 21:27.539
<i>♪ And I'm buried in the chains</i>

21:27.562 --> 21:32.567
<i>♪ Buried in the chains of love</i>

21:33.947 --> 21:37.273
<i>♪ Oh</i>

21:37.296 --> 21:39.413
<i>♪ Oh</i>

21:39.436 --> 21:40.690
<i>♪ Buried in the chains</i>

21:40.713 --> 21:45.718
<i>♪ Buried in the chains of love</i>

21:47.513 --> 21:50.872
<i>♪ Oh</i>

21:50.895 --> 21:52.587
<i>♪ Oh</i>

22:05.945 --> 22:10.674
We are not meant to be with
these creatures in this way.

22:11.537 --> 22:13.746
They deserve to be respected.

22:14.954 --> 22:17.577
They do not exist
to be our slaves,

22:19.234 --> 22:22.030
so please, I urge
you all to stop.

22:23.859 --> 22:25.447
This is a sickness.

22:27.760 --> 22:32.109
If you obsess over them,
it'll only ruin your lives.

22:36.216 --> 22:39.530
Don't let my brother's
death be in vain.

22:40.531 --> 22:43.062
I think Ted has a point.

22:43.085 --> 22:46.744
I mean, there are plenty
of fish in the sea.

22:48.021 --> 22:50.518
And you can't force love.

22:50.541 --> 22:51.899
I mean, I think that's a lesson

22:51.922 --> 22:55.420
that we could all take
from this, don't you?

22:55.443 --> 22:56.236
Hey!

22:57.514 --> 22:58.825
Fuck face!

23:00.033 --> 23:01.426
What, excuse me?

23:01.449 --> 23:02.634
Fuck face?

23:02.657 --> 23:04.429
Why don't we talk
about my problems?

23:04.452 --> 23:06.396
You don't even
know what they are!

23:06.419 --> 23:09.468
This is my fourth session and
I've only mentioned my name.

23:09.491 --> 23:11.159
Okay, well, calm down, Annie...

23:11.182 --> 23:12.011
No.

23:12.908 --> 23:13.737
It's Anne.

23:15.324 --> 23:16.751
Okay, Anne.

23:16.774 --> 23:18.235
What's your problem?

23:18.258 --> 23:19.892
What's my problem?

23:19.915 --> 23:21.089
I'll show you.

23:21.986 --> 23:22.815
This...

23:23.781 --> 23:25.484
...is my problem.

23:27.026 --> 23:28.211
Oh, yeah.

23:28.234 --> 23:29.960
Now we're in session.

23:41.765 --> 23:44.526
This is my problem.

24:26.637 --> 24:30.169
Who dares awaken
me from my slumber?

24:30.192 --> 24:30.998
You!

24:31.021 --> 24:31.826
Oh, no, shit.

24:31.849 --> 24:32.896
Oh, shit.

24:32.919 --> 24:34.760
No, no, you don't want me,

24:34.783 --> 24:37.832
you want Night of
the Living Dead.

24:37.855 --> 24:38.684
He's really fucked up.

24:40.271 --> 24:41.077
Yeah.

24:41.100 --> 24:41.928
You!

24:46.485 --> 24:47.796
Who did that?!

24:48.417 --> 24:49.603
Who did that?!

24:49.626 --> 24:51.501
Aw, it's you again, Annie.

24:51.524 --> 24:52.778
It's been three years!

24:52.801 --> 24:54.228
Three years!

24:54.251 --> 24:57.956
Have you ever spent
three years in a teapot?!

24:57.979 --> 25:00.130
Why you being so mean to me?

25:00.153 --> 25:02.547
You keep pulling me in
and out of this thing.

25:02.570 --> 25:04.997
Can you please put me
back in a big lamp?

25:05.020 --> 25:07.172
I mean, I've been
good, haven't I?

25:07.195 --> 25:10.624
I think I know what my
last wish is going to be.

25:10.647 --> 25:12.177
What is that?

25:12.200 --> 25:15.962
I can't keep you bottled
up if you don't wanna be.

25:19.483 --> 25:20.898
I wish...

25:22.762 --> 25:25.731
I wish for you to be free.

25:39.572 --> 25:40.999
Is that it?

25:41.022 --> 25:43.139
Did you have your fingers
crossed or something?

25:43.162 --> 25:45.555
I mean, what is this,
some kind of a big joke?

25:45.578 --> 25:47.281
No, I think we're free.

25:47.304 --> 25:48.109
We?

25:48.132 --> 25:49.317
We, bitch?

25:49.340 --> 25:50.871
You've been out here
waltzing around,

25:50.894 --> 25:53.034
I've been in that damn lamp.

25:53.241 --> 25:53.897
Okay.

25:55.761 --> 25:58.844
I think that's all the
time we have for today.

25:58.867 --> 26:02.043
I think we had some
good breakthroughs.

26:03.527 --> 26:07.232
Mr. Lane will be in next week
or next month or whenever,

26:07.255 --> 26:10.430
and I'll try to stop
by and say hello.

26:11.811 --> 26:12.640
Okay.

26:26.515 --> 26:27.758
Good meeting.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.436
Hmm.

27:10.352 --> 27:12.423
Honey, I'm home!

27:35.792 --> 27:38.484
Hope you're nice and wet for me!

27:44.386 --> 27:48.091
You wouldn't believe the
meeting I came from tonight.

27:48.114 --> 27:51.370
There's some real
lunatics in that place.

27:53.533 --> 27:54.949
But I don't care.

27:55.984 --> 27:58.331
I've come to see my Bubbles.

27:59.298 --> 28:00.932
My little Bubbles.

28:03.543 --> 28:04.729
How rude of me.

28:04.752 --> 28:06.731
Here, you want some?

28:06.754 --> 28:08.997
Can we play hunt for clams?

28:09.964 --> 28:12.035
You don't like that game?

28:21.320 --> 28:25.980
Maybe I should consider
moving you to the pool.

28:49.624 --> 28:53.191
I just don't understand
why you had to help him.

28:53.214 --> 28:54.744
Well, he needed the help.

28:54.767 --> 28:57.505
I mean, by the time he was
washing his hands in the urinal

28:57.528 --> 28:59.542
which was when I figured
out that he was gone.

28:59.565 --> 29:01.717
I made sure that
he got home okay.

29:01.740 --> 29:02.775
Safety first.

29:05.053 --> 29:06.376
Why won't you believe me?

29:06.399 --> 29:08.378
I do believe you.

29:08.401 --> 29:13.211
But you always go too far
outta your way to help people.

29:13.234 --> 29:15.178
Yeah, it's the
right thing to do.

29:15.201 --> 29:17.836
Well, you're
better than me, babe.

29:17.859 --> 29:19.355
That's why I love you.

29:19.378 --> 29:21.552
That is the only reason.

29:22.830 --> 29:24.360
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, mm-hm.

29:25.833 --> 29:26.730
I love you.

29:30.354 --> 29:31.816
By the way, thank you for lunch

29:31.839 --> 29:34.301
and getting me out of eating
the food that they have here.

29:34.324 --> 29:35.820
Speaking of which,

29:35.843 --> 29:39.478
I have a wonderful dinner
planned for this evening.

29:39.501 --> 29:40.548
Mm.

29:40.571 --> 29:41.676
I can't wait.

29:44.127 --> 29:45.208
Oh!

29:45.231 --> 29:46.451
Can it wait?!

29:46.474 --> 29:47.797
What?!
I can't make it tonight.

29:47.820 --> 29:48.867
Why?!
I have to work.

29:48.890 --> 29:50.558
I'm gonna be here all night.

29:50.581 --> 29:51.582
All night?

29:52.791 --> 29:55.046
What do they need you
to do here all night?

29:55.069 --> 29:56.426
Honey, I told you,
I am trying to do

29:56.449 --> 29:58.290
as much work as I possibly can.

29:58.313 --> 30:01.052
You keep disappearing
for no reason.

30:01.075 --> 30:02.847
I don't like it when I
wake up in the morning

30:02.870 --> 30:04.400
and you're still not home.

30:04.423 --> 30:06.126
Honey, I do not do this
every single night, okay?

30:06.149 --> 30:07.472
This is a once in a while thing.

30:07.495 --> 30:08.887
I'm trying to pay
for our honeymoon.

30:08.910 --> 30:10.268
It's gonna cost us a fortune.

30:10.291 --> 30:11.890
Okay.

30:11.913 --> 30:14.893
Nick, you know how I
feel about infidelity,

30:14.916 --> 30:16.101
so if there's someone else,

30:16.124 --> 30:18.103
you need to just
say that right now.

30:18.126 --> 30:19.093
Alyssa...

30:19.783 --> 30:21.302
No.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.030
Alyssa, no.

30:25.789 --> 30:27.791
There is no one else.

30:31.484 --> 30:34.280
Then be with me tonight.

30:39.734 --> 30:41.046
I can't.

30:45.878 --> 30:50.572
Well, I sure as hell can't
marry someone I don't trust.

30:53.506 --> 30:55.060
Enjoy your night.

30:56.406 --> 30:57.717
Alyssa.

31:15.321 --> 31:16.150
Oh.

31:27.264 --> 31:28.093
No.

31:29.094 --> 31:29.922
No.

31:40.968 --> 31:41.796
Come on.

31:42.279 --> 31:42.728
Come on.

31:43.832 --> 31:44.362
Not tonight.

31:44.385 --> 31:44.833
Come on.

31:47.043 --> 31:47.871
Dammit.

31:52.427 --> 31:53.785
Come on, Falcon.

31:53.808 --> 31:56.236
Come on.

32:01.747 --> 32:03.059
Oh, God.

32:07.166 --> 32:08.996
This'll work.

32:11.239 --> 32:12.758
That should do it.

32:20.490 --> 32:21.986
Come on.

32:22.009 --> 32:25.403
Please, God, if you start this
car, I will love you forever.

32:28.463 --> 32:29.303
Fuck you, God!

32:29.326 --> 32:30.304
Fuck you!

32:30.327 --> 32:31.604

32:46.723 --> 32:48.035
Oh, Jesus.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.532
You need a hand, stranger?

32:51.555 --> 32:55.157
Or if it's a big problem,
you need two hands?

32:56.491 --> 32:58.194
No, I'm sorry, I'm good.

32:58.217 --> 32:59.816
You scared the shit outta me.

32:59.839 --> 33:01.646
Ah, it's quite alright,
it's quite alright.

33:01.669 --> 33:03.130
Let me just take a
deep look inside.

33:03.153 --> 33:05.788
Sometimes, you have to get
real close to the base.

33:05.811 --> 33:07.307
Here we go, one, two, three.

33:07.330 --> 33:08.538
Ooohhh!

33:09.125 --> 33:10.724
Ooohhh. Whoa.

33:10.747 --> 33:11.759
Okay.

33:11.782 --> 33:12.611
Hm.

33:14.061 --> 33:15.280
Yeah!

33:15.303 --> 33:17.696
There's a lot going on in here!

33:17.719 --> 33:18.893
Lots of stuff.

33:19.790 --> 33:22.046
Is this the new V7?

33:22.069 --> 33:23.771
It's a beaut!

33:23.794 --> 33:24.600
Yeah.

33:24.623 --> 33:26.015
What do you see?

33:26.038 --> 33:26.866
Oh, man.

33:27.798 --> 33:30.330
Nice to meet ya!

33:30.353 --> 33:31.526
Name's Finbar.

33:33.839 --> 33:36.566
But only my friends
call me that.

33:40.742 --> 33:42.238
Oh!

33:42.261 --> 33:43.688
Ah!

33:43.711 --> 33:45.437
Here is your problem.

33:47.197 --> 33:48.026
Yeah!

33:49.475 --> 33:52.110
Looks like you were using
the wrong stick of gum.

33:52.133 --> 33:54.480
Hm.

33:57.587 --> 33:58.944
Hm.

33:58.967 --> 34:00.394
Not sticky enough.

34:00.417 --> 34:01.637
No worries!

34:01.660 --> 34:03.328
I can give you a ride.

34:03.351 --> 34:06.159
You like to sing in the car?

34:06.182 --> 34:10.945
Truck's a little bumpy, but
it feels nice on your heinie!

34:16.123 --> 34:16.951
Yeah.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.688
Yeah.

34:19.712 --> 34:22.208
Hmmm.

34:22.232 --> 34:23.417
Mm.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.786
That's not okay.

34:26.202 --> 34:27.375
Hmm.

34:30.792 --> 34:32.172
Hmmm.

34:33.795 --> 34:35.188
You know, I'm good.

34:36.453 --> 34:39.571
I'm just gonna, I'll
call someone for help.

34:39.594 --> 34:40.492
You can go.

34:41.355 --> 34:44.128
This green piece of shit.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.715
Hm, what's this?
Mama.

34:45.737 --> 34:46.681
Hm.

34:52.297 --> 34:53.482
I was looking for this.

34:53.505 --> 34:54.724
Yeah, this was nice.

34:54.746 --> 34:56.001
Okay!

34:56.024 --> 34:57.244
I...
You know it's just a wee

34:57.267 --> 35:00.903
bit tight, but you
can sit on my lap.

35:00.926 --> 35:03.031
That shan't be a problem.

35:04.378 --> 35:05.620
I'm good.

35:06.207 --> 35:07.151
I'm good.

35:07.174 --> 35:08.462
I'm just fucking with ya.

35:08.485 --> 35:11.086
You know, tweaking your tits?

35:11.109 --> 35:13.812
You should probably
just come along with me.

35:13.835 --> 35:15.883
It's gonna be a
full moon tonight,

35:15.906 --> 35:18.116
and all the freaks are out.

35:19.255 --> 35:20.532
Yeah, I know.

35:22.085 --> 35:23.063
Just hop on in!

35:23.086 --> 35:24.329
Sit on my face!

35:26.054 --> 35:27.343
Ain't it nice?

35:27.366 --> 35:28.965
Had to flip it over, though.

35:28.988 --> 35:31.658
Wasn't too comfortable with
people sitting on my pee-pee.

35:31.681 --> 35:34.132
I prefer they sit on my face.

35:35.754 --> 35:37.457
I think I can fix it.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.872
I think I'm good.

35:38.895 --> 35:39.999
Alrighty!

35:42.554 --> 35:43.727
Suit yourself!

35:45.108 --> 35:47.559
I guess I'll go fuck
myself and be on my way...

35:49.216 --> 35:50.608
'Cause mine's right side up!

35:50.631 --> 35:51.436
Ha ha!

35:51.459 --> 35:52.368
Get it?!

35:52.391 --> 35:54.750
Gets me every time!

35:54.773 --> 35:56.292
Ah, shit!

35:57.293 --> 35:58.156
Ha!

35:59.502 --> 36:02.125
Alright, I'll see you later.

36:03.299 --> 36:04.300
Take care.

36:05.715 --> 36:06.658
Yeah!

36:07.544 --> 36:08.373
Yes, baby!

36:09.270 --> 36:10.593
Woo-hoo!

36:10.616 --> 36:14.689
<i>♪ Let me do the Finger
Dance ♪</i>

36:58.008 --> 36:58.837
Hello?

37:02.150 --> 37:03.738
Is anyone in there?

37:06.120 --> 37:07.328
Hello?

37:08.709 --> 37:11.470
Hey, sorry, I'm just
having a little car trouble.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.658
Well, why didn't
you say so, friend?

37:15.681 --> 37:20.525
I'm Andy of Andy's Abominable
Snow Cones, and you are?

37:20.548 --> 37:22.458
I'm Nick, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

37:22.481 --> 37:25.599
No, it's a pleasure
to meet you, friend.

37:25.622 --> 37:28.188
What seems to be the problem?

37:28.211 --> 37:30.017
I actually don't know, but
if you can give me a hand,

37:30.040 --> 37:31.295
I could totally pay you.

37:31.318 --> 37:32.365
Pay me?!

37:32.388 --> 37:33.538
Nonsense!

37:33.561 --> 37:35.506
I'd be glad to help.

37:35.529 --> 37:37.013
We're friends.

37:38.325 --> 37:39.498
Snow cone?

37:41.638 --> 37:42.823
No, I'm good.

37:42.846 --> 37:44.998
I'm actually in a
little bit of a rush.

37:45.021 --> 37:48.312
Not a problem, not a problem.

37:48.335 --> 37:49.405
I understand.

37:56.412 --> 38:01.348
You see, us snowmen have
been mechanics for centuries.

38:02.763 --> 38:04.949
Dipstick Depot, that's
my brother Ricky's place,

38:04.972 --> 38:09.540
and Lube Palace over on 8th,
that's my cousin Freddy's,

38:09.563 --> 38:12.612
and RJ's Rimjobs,
that's my Uncle Bobby's,

38:12.635 --> 38:15.200
so I kinda got a feel
for these things.

38:15.223 --> 38:16.052
Snow cone?

38:16.984 --> 38:17.812
No.

38:21.402 --> 38:24.727
Well, you see, your problem
here is this thing is shot.

38:24.750 --> 38:25.659
You looked so quick.

38:25.682 --> 38:27.143
How did you see anything?

38:27.166 --> 38:28.524
Well, that's the other thing

38:28.547 --> 38:32.356
you hu-mans don't know
about us snow-mans,

38:32.379 --> 38:35.186
we have impeccable eyesight.

38:35.209 --> 38:37.015
Except for my
brother-in-law Stan.

38:37.038 --> 38:38.488
He's blind.

38:41.077 --> 38:43.159
So what do I do?

38:43.182 --> 38:46.738
Well, you should
hop in the back,

38:47.911 --> 38:49.304
have all the snow
cones you want,

38:49.327 --> 38:52.571
and I'll take you
where you need to be.

39:00.130 --> 39:02.109
Alright.
Yeah!

39:02.132 --> 39:02.938
Yes!

39:02.961 --> 39:04.284
Yes, yes, yes!

39:04.307 --> 39:05.492
Yes!

39:05.515 --> 39:09.013
We are gonna have so
much fun together!

39:09.036 --> 39:10.865
Okay.
Yeah!

39:11.487 --> 39:12.350
Yes!

39:25.708 --> 39:26.962
Oh, it's good.

39:26.985 --> 39:28.745
Yeah, it's real good.

39:30.091 --> 39:33.106
You know, I'm felling
a little bit woozy.

39:39.238 --> 39:44.243
Nights like this always
make me think about it.

39:45.452 --> 39:47.534
She's fine, Hildie.

39:47.557 --> 39:49.732
I can feel it in my bones.

39:50.664 --> 39:52.815
One day, we will
go get her back.

39:52.838 --> 39:57.233
But right now, you can't lose
focus on what's important.

39:57.256 --> 39:58.994
We'll make them all pay,

39:59.017 --> 40:02.238
even if we have to
do it one by one.

40:02.261 --> 40:04.689
I know the importance
of what we're doing here.

40:06.887 --> 40:08.452
My lady!

40:08.475 --> 40:11.075
Who dares disturb us?

40:11.098 --> 40:12.766
You, oinker!

40:12.789 --> 40:15.459
We've captured another one!

40:15.482 --> 40:17.012
What did I tell you

40:17.035 --> 40:20.498
about barging in here
with useless information?

40:20.521 --> 40:22.086
Yes, I know, sir...

40:22.109 --> 40:24.364
And isn't capturing the humans

40:24.387 --> 40:26.021
what we do everyday?

40:26.044 --> 40:28.472
You seem to be telling
me what I already know.

40:28.495 --> 40:30.370
I know, I know you know, but...

40:30.393 --> 40:33.131
So this little piggy
needs to take his fat ass

40:33.154 --> 40:36.618
back to his post
before I huff and puff

40:36.641 --> 40:38.792
and sell you over
to Boar's Head.

40:38.815 --> 40:41.381
But we found chains!

40:41.404 --> 40:43.866
You found chains?

40:43.889 --> 40:45.799
Monster chains.

40:45.822 --> 40:49.964
He's one of those
monster mashers.

40:50.862 --> 40:51.805
Monster mashers?!

40:51.828 --> 40:53.531
Well, why didn't you say so?!

40:53.554 --> 40:55.844
I've heard enough!

40:55.867 --> 40:57.915
Look into this.

40:57.938 --> 41:00.458
Yes, as you wish.

41:02.011 --> 41:03.978
Bring him to me.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.298
Ahhh.

41:16.543 --> 41:18.625
Oh, where am I?

41:18.648 --> 41:20.547
Nicholas.

41:24.274 --> 41:26.046
Why am I here?

41:26.069 --> 41:27.427
Who are you?

41:27.450 --> 41:28.290
Who am I?

41:29.556 --> 41:33.042
The question isn't
who, but what.

41:33.870 --> 41:34.871
Alright.

41:36.563 --> 41:38.496
What, are you?

41:39.945 --> 41:42.787
When you think
you're alone in the dark,

41:42.810 --> 41:45.169
tucked away safe and sound,

41:45.192 --> 41:48.241
I am the reason you
can't sleep at night.

41:48.264 --> 41:51.969
I'm the one that makes the
hair on your neck stand up,

41:51.992 --> 41:54.212
when your body
begins to stiffen,

41:54.235 --> 41:57.906
and you notice a bump rising
from beneath the sheets.

41:57.929 --> 41:58.723
Wait.

41:59.827 --> 42:01.530
Are you hitting on me?

42:02.727 --> 42:05.039
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

42:08.422 --> 42:11.091
Whoa, why are you
doing this to me?

42:11.114 --> 42:12.576
Do you know that I'm a...

42:12.599 --> 42:14.957
Do I know that
you're a monster masher?

42:14.980 --> 42:17.373
And that you get off
on enslaving our kind

42:17.396 --> 42:20.480
for your own
disgusting pleasures?

42:20.503 --> 42:22.206
Monster masher?

42:22.229 --> 42:23.863
What are you talking about?!

42:23.886 --> 42:27.383
Oh, being coy now, are we?

42:27.406 --> 42:31.767
So, then, what do you
have to say about these?!

42:31.790 --> 42:33.493
I can explain those.

42:33.516 --> 42:35.150
No need to explain.

42:35.173 --> 42:38.153
We have all the
explanation we need.

42:38.176 --> 42:39.603
You are one of the rare bunch

42:39.626 --> 42:42.537
who likes to play with the
goblins' goblets, aren't you?

42:42.560 --> 42:45.436
Or perhaps tickle
Peter Piper's pickle?

42:45.459 --> 42:48.301
Or maybe play with
Rumpel's foreskin?

42:48.324 --> 42:51.925
And I'm willing to bet you'd
enjoy giving our friend Andy

42:51.948 --> 42:55.619
some abominable blue
balls to make him suffer!

42:55.642 --> 42:57.793
No, no, no, you
got it all wrong!

42:57.816 --> 42:59.312
Well, now it's time

42:59.335 --> 43:02.004
to make you suffer, Mr. Lane.

43:02.027 --> 43:04.904
I cannot guarantee you'll
enjoy your stay here with us,

43:04.927 --> 43:07.838
but I can promise that
we'll try to make it

43:07.861 --> 43:11.255
as pleasurable as possible.

43:11.278 --> 43:15.224
So let me be the first to
welcome you to Camp Morningwood.

43:15.247 --> 43:16.709
Don't understand.

43:16.732 --> 43:18.745
I'm an AA moderator.

43:18.768 --> 43:21.783
Oh, believe
me, by the end of all this,

43:21.806 --> 43:23.888
you'll wish you were drunk.

43:23.911 --> 43:25.441
Not that kind of AA.

43:25.464 --> 43:26.960
Silence!

43:26.983 --> 43:30.792
One day, you humans will learn
to never disrespect us again!

43:30.815 --> 43:32.276
But until that time,

43:32.299 --> 43:34.934
we shall give you a taste
of your own medicine.

43:34.957 --> 43:35.785
Pig!

43:36.717 --> 43:37.833
Pig!

43:37.856 --> 43:40.307
Bring your fat ass over here.

43:45.553 --> 43:47.809
Oh, give me a break.

43:47.832 --> 43:49.040
Wait here.

44:07.645 --> 44:10.279
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

44:10.302 --> 44:11.349
Hop into your cage.

44:11.372 --> 44:12.661
I'll throw you some lettuce.

44:12.684 --> 44:15.699
Mm, I'll take eight bundles.

44:15.722 --> 44:16.872
You sure you don't
want the bricks?

44:16.895 --> 44:17.977
They're on sale.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.083
No, I like the look of the hay.

44:21.106 --> 44:24.052
It's, ahh, more natural.

44:24.075 --> 44:25.709
More bang for your
buck with the bricks.

44:25.732 --> 44:26.917
I'll give you a good deal.

44:26.940 --> 44:30.299
No, no, I got
this under control.

44:30.322 --> 44:31.507
Thank you, Gary.

44:31.530 --> 44:32.957
Alright.

44:32.980 --> 44:35.719
Step up, shy man, I'll be
with you in a second, alright?

44:35.742 --> 44:37.548
So you're telling me

44:37.571 --> 44:39.861
the Abominable
Snowman drugged you

44:39.884 --> 44:43.209
with a grape and watermelon ice?

44:43.232 --> 44:44.417
Yes.

44:44.440 --> 44:46.488
You see, I find
that hard to believe.

44:46.511 --> 44:49.146
The Snowman makes the best
grape and watermelon ice

44:49.169 --> 44:50.354
in the whole town.

44:50.377 --> 44:51.976
Are you serious?

44:51.999 --> 44:53.460
I don't have time for this.

44:53.483 --> 44:56.394
Come on, man, I'm the one
who doesn't have time for this.

44:56.417 --> 44:58.880
I mean, he's selling
the ices for 2 dollars!

44:58.903 --> 45:00.295
That's a great deal!

45:00.318 --> 45:02.711
And I don't think too
kindly of you people

45:02.734 --> 45:04.644
coming down on
monsters like this!

45:04.667 --> 45:05.680
It's not right!

45:05.703 --> 45:06.991
I don't hate monsters.

45:07.014 --> 45:08.372
I help monsters.

45:08.395 --> 45:10.236
I hate kidnappers!

45:10.259 --> 45:11.858
You see this guy?

45:11.881 --> 45:14.067
He's a monster!

45:14.090 --> 45:15.954
He's a beast!

45:16.714 --> 45:18.244
Huh?

45:18.267 --> 45:21.661
And he's the nicest guy I know.

45:21.684 --> 45:26.114
Are you kidnapping
any people, Beast?

45:28.656 --> 45:30.014
He said no.

45:30.037 --> 45:31.636
Good day, sir!

45:31.659 --> 45:33.362
No, no, no!

45:33.385 --> 45:34.214
Shit!

45:36.112 --> 45:37.746
Who else can I call?

45:37.769 --> 45:38.574
Oh.

45:42.532 --> 45:45.018
So much nicer than the twigs.

45:48.331 --> 45:50.725
Doc, thank God,
I need your help.

45:50.748 --> 45:53.417
I'm being harassed and
they got me held captive.

45:53.440 --> 45:54.268
What?

45:55.407 --> 45:57.662
What, you got
something in your ass

45:57.685 --> 45:59.664
and she finds it attractive?

45:59.687 --> 46:00.458
No!

46:00.481 --> 46:01.736
Well, I don't know.

46:01.759 --> 46:05.670
I mean, if, you know,
it's alright with you,

46:05.693 --> 46:08.673
in the long run, I don't know,
maybe go for it, I guess.

46:08.696 --> 46:10.779
What are you saying?
I need your help!

46:10.802 --> 46:12.022
What? I can't hear you.

46:12.045 --> 46:13.402
You're breaking up here.

46:13.425 --> 46:15.508
Let me call you right back.

46:16.774 --> 46:19.777
Dammit!

46:28.924 --> 46:32.801
Ooh, someone's in trouble!

46:32.824 --> 46:36.632
Where did you get this?

46:36.655 --> 46:38.220
What? Don't I
get a phone call?

46:38.243 --> 46:40.395
Throw him into the double pen.

46:40.418 --> 46:41.465
Oh, my!

46:41.488 --> 46:42.742
Already?!

46:42.765 --> 46:43.674
Yes!

46:43.697 --> 46:45.572
Single won't do.

46:45.595 --> 46:47.091
Are you sure?

46:47.114 --> 46:49.335
Don't question me, piggy.

46:49.358 --> 46:51.981
An eye for an eye.

46:57.469 --> 47:00.507
Oh, God, I crack myself up.

47:03.890 --> 47:05.489
So, did you see
the game last night?

47:05.512 --> 47:06.904
No.

47:06.927 --> 47:09.320
If my wife caught me watching
a game on my free time,

47:09.343 --> 47:10.149
she'd put me to sleep.

47:10.172 --> 47:11.253
Mm-hm.

47:11.276 --> 47:13.221
Little trouble in Dreamland?

47:13.244 --> 47:14.670
Oh, you can say that again.

47:14.693 --> 47:18.053
She's really been flipping
my hourglass lately.

47:18.076 --> 47:20.780
She doesn't seem to understand
that I got a job to do.

47:20.803 --> 47:21.954
Mm.
I have to work

47:21.977 --> 47:23.507
the graveyard shift.

47:23.530 --> 47:26.406
Sounds like you got a little
sand in your vagina, buddy.

47:26.429 --> 47:29.582
Yeah, sand, and
that's another thing.

47:29.605 --> 47:31.308
I've had enough with this sand.

47:31.331 --> 47:32.654
Have you ever been
down to the beach

47:32.677 --> 47:34.449
and gotten sand in your shorts?

47:34.472 --> 47:35.381
Hm?

47:35.404 --> 47:36.209
Mm.

47:36.232 --> 47:37.924
That's my life.

47:39.097 --> 47:41.686
The chaffing on my
balls is unreal.

47:42.687 --> 47:43.757
Your balls?

47:45.448 --> 47:48.118
I don't wanna hear
about your balls!

47:48.141 --> 47:50.741
My balls used to belong
to some other guy.

47:50.764 --> 47:52.053
Ho-ho!
Yeah, yeah.

47:52.076 --> 47:53.502
You think you got problems?

47:53.525 --> 47:56.160
My people have been persecuted
for thousands of years.

47:56.183 --> 47:57.644
Do you hear me complaining?

47:57.667 --> 47:58.922
Here we go again.

47:58.945 --> 48:00.164
Oh, no, no, no, no.

48:00.187 --> 48:02.926
Awhile back, I
was out on a date,

48:02.949 --> 48:05.514
waiting for this hot
piece of ass to show up,

48:05.537 --> 48:07.654
when this schmuck calls me,

48:07.677 --> 48:11.796
"Frankenstein, Frankenstein,
Frankenstein...

48:11.819 --> 48:13.522
...Frankenstein!"

48:15.202 --> 48:17.837
Oh, well, that really
twisted my bolts

48:17.860 --> 48:21.668
because after all these years,
everyone should get it right.

48:21.691 --> 48:23.532
My name is Frank Stein!

48:23.555 --> 48:25.178
It's Jewish!

48:27.214 --> 48:29.676
I think that little
shit did it on purpose.

48:29.699 --> 48:30.850
I understand.

48:30.873 --> 48:33.082
No, I don't think you do.

48:33.980 --> 48:35.061
You see this?

48:35.084 --> 48:37.121
This is Frankenstein.

48:38.329 --> 48:39.963
See him with those,
fakakta hair there?

48:39.986 --> 48:43.207
Dr. Frankenstein made me...

48:43.230 --> 48:44.760
Frank Stein,

48:44.783 --> 48:47.902
or sometimes referred to
as Frankenstein's monster.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.213
I'm okay with that.

48:49.236 --> 48:50.076
Frankenstein.

48:50.099 --> 48:51.077
Frank Stein.

48:51.100 --> 48:52.665
Frankenstein.

48:52.688 --> 48:54.287
Frankenstein's monster.

48:54.310 --> 48:56.013
Preferably, Frank Stein.

48:56.036 --> 48:56.876
Frankenstein.

48:56.899 --> 48:57.773
Frank Stein.

48:57.796 --> 48:58.809
Frankenstein.

48:58.832 --> 49:00.696
Frankenstein's monster.

49:02.974 --> 49:06.127
Frank Stein's monster.

49:07.945 --> 49:10.338
Don't try anything funny!

49:10.361 --> 49:15.366
The security is rock solid
here at Camp Morningwood.

49:17.023 --> 49:18.829
Yes, it's easy for
me to understand,

49:18.852 --> 49:20.681
but what about Bernie?

49:22.580 --> 49:24.697
You get it, Bernie?

49:24.720 --> 49:26.906
Bernie, I'm talking to you.

49:26.929 --> 49:31.635
You may have one eye, but I
know you got two fuckin' ears!

49:31.658 --> 49:32.843
I'm sorry.

49:32.866 --> 49:34.949
Do you need something, Virgil?

49:34.972 --> 49:37.261
You answer me when
I'm talking to you.

49:37.284 --> 49:39.160
Oh, my mistake.

49:39.183 --> 49:43.198
Sometimes, I zone out when
I'm keeping an eye on things.

49:43.221 --> 49:46.132
Yeah, that's why you got
hit by a parked car last week,

49:46.155 --> 49:47.754
you dopey bastard.

49:47.777 --> 49:48.997
Yeah. Yeah.

49:49.020 --> 49:52.759
You're what my people
would call a schlemiel.

49:52.782 --> 49:54.382
Oh, thank you.

49:54.405 --> 49:56.729
I've heard that before.

49:56.752 --> 49:59.180
You're really fuckin'
stupid, you know that?

49:59.203 --> 50:01.803
Yeah, that's why
his wife left him.

50:01.826 --> 50:03.287
His wife didn't leave him.

50:03.310 --> 50:04.875
She was chopped down.

50:04.898 --> 50:07.498
He married a fuckin' tree.

50:26.575 --> 50:28.232
Classic.

50:29.681 --> 50:32.730
I got a new monster masher.

50:32.753 --> 50:36.044
Why don't you
bring him in, Bernie?

50:36.067 --> 50:38.978
But I thought I wasn't
allowed to handle the prisoners.

50:39.001 --> 50:42.119
Nope, new rule,
straight from the top.

50:42.142 --> 50:44.018
You got a promotion.

50:44.041 --> 50:46.813
You're allowed inside now!

50:46.836 --> 50:48.631
Yaaaay!

50:50.012 --> 50:51.197
Jeez.

50:51.220 --> 50:52.256
That's great.

50:53.498 --> 50:55.983
I've never been inside before.

50:57.675 --> 51:01.863
Everyone deserves to
experience the double pen.

51:01.886 --> 51:03.646
Go pop that cherry.

51:07.754 --> 51:08.559
Ow.

51:08.582 --> 51:09.664
Ooh.

51:09.687 --> 51:11.252
Okay-dokey.

51:11.275 --> 51:12.448
Thank you.

51:24.978 --> 51:26.462
Aw, come on, guys!

51:27.636 --> 51:29.362
I got a promotion!

51:30.466 --> 51:33.860
You can't do this to me anymore!

51:37.024 --> 51:37.853
No fair.

51:41.201 --> 51:42.582
Hey, man.

51:43.548 --> 51:45.032
Are you okay?

51:47.794 --> 51:50.291
Nah, just not feeling too good.

51:50.314 --> 51:53.052
That time of the month, huh?

51:56.458 --> 51:59.403
Yeah, something like that.

51:59.426 --> 52:01.371
I just gotta get outta here now.

52:02.981 --> 52:04.926
Yeah, well, don't we all?

52:04.949 --> 52:07.963
Do you not know
what's going on here?

52:07.986 --> 52:09.413
No.

52:09.436 --> 52:11.001
Do you?

52:11.024 --> 52:12.439
Oh, I do.

52:14.027 --> 52:15.546
I really do.

52:16.409 --> 52:17.594
So tell us what you did.

52:17.617 --> 52:20.114
Yes, we'd all love to hear it.

52:20.137 --> 52:22.530
I didn't do anything.

52:22.553 --> 52:23.703
Come on.

52:23.726 --> 52:26.327
You must be the
dirtiest of them all.

52:26.350 --> 52:28.628
This is no place to be shy.

52:29.491 --> 52:30.319
Tell us.

52:31.217 --> 52:32.402
Yeah.

52:32.425 --> 52:35.324
Don't be a chicken
shit, chicken shit.

52:48.924 --> 52:51.110
I said I didn't do anything!

52:51.133 --> 52:52.801
Alright!

52:52.824 --> 52:54.516
Okay?!
Okay!

52:58.899 --> 53:00.211
Sorry.

53:01.143 --> 53:02.317
I'm sorry.

53:03.387 --> 53:04.905
It's getting late.

53:07.563 --> 53:09.910
Don't matter what he done,

53:12.499 --> 53:14.398
we're all fucked,

53:15.778 --> 53:19.782
and I mean literally, like
we're gonna get fucked tonight.

53:22.129 --> 53:24.730
Frank just
took one of his bolts out!

53:24.753 --> 53:27.077
And his head fell off!

53:30.931 --> 53:32.703
Kick it, kick his head.

53:32.726 --> 53:35.189
Ow!

53:35.212 --> 53:36.040
Bernie?

53:37.869 --> 53:39.595
How you doing, buddy?

53:41.563 --> 53:43.956
Pretty good, actually.

53:43.979 --> 53:46.165
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

53:46.188 --> 53:47.753
Put it back on!

53:47.776 --> 53:49.364
It smells like shit!

53:52.263 --> 53:54.161
You sure you're okay?

53:55.162 --> 53:57.901
No one wants to play with me.

53:57.924 --> 53:59.305
I'm ugly.

54:00.478 --> 54:02.894
You're not ugly, Bernie.

54:06.726 --> 54:08.452
I'm not okay.

54:09.694 --> 54:12.605
I took so many
anti-depressants last week,

54:12.628 --> 54:14.975
I went blind in my left eye.

54:16.908 --> 54:19.325
It's the same thing everyday.

54:20.187 --> 54:21.499
I wake up,

54:22.535 --> 54:24.721
I put my contact in,

54:24.744 --> 54:26.746
I brush my tooth,

54:27.333 --> 54:29.266
I comb my hair,

54:30.025 --> 54:31.751
and I come to work.

54:34.236 --> 54:36.215
The same thing.

54:36.238 --> 54:38.044
Look, I know it's tough,

54:38.067 --> 54:39.770
but you can't let what
others think about you

54:39.793 --> 54:41.634
affect who you are.

54:41.657 --> 54:44.177
You gotta be true to yourself.

54:46.490 --> 54:47.985
See?

54:48.008 --> 54:50.747
Our friend Bernie here
could teach us all a lesson.

54:50.770 --> 54:52.680
Now, you guys have been here
a lot longer than I have,

54:52.703 --> 54:54.198
and you see the
way he's treated,

54:54.221 --> 54:56.856
and why, because he's
a little different?

54:56.879 --> 54:58.720
Because he's a little slow.

54:58.743 --> 55:00.297
I'm slow?!

55:02.920 --> 55:06.717
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

55:07.890 --> 55:09.421
Being different is who you are,

55:09.444 --> 55:11.423
and why should that
be a bad thing?

55:11.446 --> 55:12.976
Right?

55:12.999 --> 55:15.910
I mean, who's to say that
being different is wrong?

55:15.933 --> 55:18.280
Oh, so touching.

55:19.385 --> 55:22.365
Filthy little maggots,
aren't they, humans?

55:22.388 --> 55:24.988
Oh, yes, my lady.

55:25.011 --> 55:26.461
Oh, filthy.

55:27.393 --> 55:28.980
Filthy indeed.

55:30.223 --> 55:31.684
What are you doing?!

55:31.707 --> 55:33.962
Nothing,
nothing, nothing at all.

55:33.985 --> 55:36.275
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

55:38.093 --> 55:41.176
Any word on our new prisoner?

55:41.199 --> 55:43.420
No, not yet,
I couldn't get him to talk,

55:43.443 --> 55:46.250
but don't worry, he'll
crack soon enough,

55:46.273 --> 55:48.632
and, oh, my.

55:48.655 --> 55:51.313
What a nice crack, it is.

55:53.419 --> 55:57.331
How could you be so
selfish, you faceless fuck?!

55:57.354 --> 55:58.780
Jesus.

55:58.803 --> 56:02.474
Just lounging around while
people like that are out there!

56:02.497 --> 56:03.889
You're right, Hildie!

56:03.912 --> 56:05.131
God, you're right!

56:05.154 --> 56:07.398
My deepest apologies.

56:08.951 --> 56:12.863
It's not me you should
be apologizing to,

56:12.886 --> 56:15.130
it's poor Esmeralda.

56:16.925 --> 56:20.204
But you can't do
that, now can you?

56:20.929 --> 56:23.518
Because she's not here.

56:25.278 --> 56:28.431
And I thought you
cared about her.

56:28.454 --> 56:29.880
I do!

56:29.903 --> 56:31.675
I don't know what
I was thinking.

56:31.698 --> 56:34.333
Well, clearly, you weren't!

56:36.013 --> 56:37.014
How dare he?

56:38.464 --> 56:41.892
How dare he come into this place

56:41.915 --> 56:46.000
meant for monsters to
live in peace, and...

56:46.023 --> 56:47.588
Take her from us!

56:47.611 --> 56:51.454
She's probably being
tortured as we speak.

56:51.477 --> 56:53.456
Don't say that.

56:53.479 --> 56:57.149
They must all
suffer for their ways.

56:57.172 --> 57:01.176
Revenge is the only
thing that matters.

57:02.315 --> 57:06.492
Revenge on every
one of these humans!

57:08.597 --> 57:10.714
What's your name?

57:10.737 --> 57:12.267
My name is Evan.

57:12.290 --> 57:15.432
Evan, can I ask
you why you're here?

57:16.502 --> 57:17.859
The yeti.

57:17.882 --> 57:19.551
No, it's how you got here.

57:19.574 --> 57:20.851
I'm asking why.

57:22.646 --> 57:24.314
Because the monsters are mad,

57:24.337 --> 57:27.559
and they're taking it out
on me, on all of us, okay?

57:27.582 --> 57:29.423
Didn't we go over that, new guy?

57:29.446 --> 57:31.344
No, we did, I just...

57:32.276 --> 57:34.531
Why do you think
they picked you?

57:34.554 --> 57:36.314
Because...

57:37.764 --> 57:40.882
Well, because I haven't
exactly treated the monsters

57:40.905 --> 57:43.022
how they like to be treated.

57:43.045 --> 57:45.093
And why is that?

57:45.116 --> 57:48.407
They're below us,
everyone knows it.

57:48.430 --> 57:50.823
They're not humans, and they
shouldn't be treated like us.

57:52.123 --> 57:53.826
That's not true.

57:53.849 --> 57:54.758
Okay, why am I being...

57:54.781 --> 57:55.828
What the hell

57:55.851 --> 57:57.865
are you laughing at, Kylie?

57:57.888 --> 57:59.280
Do you hear yourself?

57:59.303 --> 58:00.523
What?

58:00.546 --> 58:04.458
She's laughing 'cause
you're black, you idiot.

58:04.481 --> 58:05.942
Okay, fine.

58:05.965 --> 58:09.152
So you're telling me you
don't all feel the same way?

58:09.175 --> 58:10.843
Not really.

58:10.866 --> 58:12.466
Men are assholes.

58:12.489 --> 58:14.145
Monsters are better.

58:15.595 --> 58:17.528
I think they're sexy.

58:18.667 --> 58:20.853
You see, Evan, you
can't persecute someone

58:20.876 --> 58:22.855
for being different
than you are,

58:22.878 --> 58:27.481
especially when in the end,
we all have so much in common.

58:32.336 --> 58:34.994
These humans are all the same.

58:36.685 --> 58:38.595
They can't be trusted!

58:38.618 --> 58:40.079
Oh, yes, madam.

58:40.102 --> 58:44.417
But don't worry, things are
being set straight as we speak.

59:01.676 --> 59:05.001
Uh, uh, uh, that spot's
reserved for the boys.

59:05.024 --> 59:07.923
Well, where am
I supposed to sit?

59:09.891 --> 59:13.354
Ahh... you see,
that's just it, Hill,

59:13.377 --> 59:15.390
I'm going away to college
at the end of summer

59:15.413 --> 59:19.256
and you're staying
here, and maybe...

59:19.279 --> 59:21.120
Maybe it's smart if
we just end this now,

59:21.143 --> 59:24.261
you know, before anyone
gets too attached.

59:24.284 --> 59:25.113
But I...

59:26.977 --> 59:27.805
I...

59:31.498 --> 59:34.225
I hope you lead
a miserable life.

59:35.779 --> 59:37.033
Now, if there's anything else

59:37.056 --> 59:39.898
you'd like to say
before you run...

59:39.921 --> 59:41.969
Don't feel too bad.

59:41.992 --> 59:44.627
You gave a great blowjob.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.847
Where the hell is everyone?!

01:00:10.986 --> 01:00:12.827
My name is Andy.

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:17.821
I'm a yeti, I sell snow
cones, and I hate humans.

01:00:19.754 --> 01:00:20.617
Okay.

01:00:21.928 --> 01:00:24.344
Why do you hate humans, Andy?

01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:27.658
I don't... know.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:31.363
Um. When did this, uhh...

01:00:31.386 --> 01:00:34.769
When did this feeling
of hatred start?

01:00:35.735 --> 01:00:38.324
I don't... know.

01:00:40.291 --> 01:00:44.859
Well, do you remember
something from your past

01:00:44.882 --> 01:00:46.896
that might have triggered this?

01:00:46.919 --> 01:00:51.889
Well, 'cause Madam Hildie
told me to, does that count?

01:00:52.545 --> 01:00:53.247
That counts.

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:54.167
Mm.
Okay.

01:00:55.375 --> 01:00:57.009
Why did she tell you that?

01:00:57.032 --> 01:01:00.518
Now that, that, I do know.

01:01:02.279 --> 01:01:04.810
Alright, everybody, form a line.

01:01:04.833 --> 01:01:07.848
I've got plenty of snow
for everyone's cones.

01:01:07.871 --> 01:01:10.954
I got lime, I got a watermelon,

01:01:10.977 --> 01:01:14.648
I've got a very special
dingleberry flavor.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.983
That's my personal favorite.

01:01:18.122 --> 01:01:21.240
You ever wanna do
something useful, Andy,

01:01:21.263 --> 01:01:26.245
instead of being a servant
to these rotten little kids?

01:01:26.268 --> 01:01:27.626
Hey, no cutting!

01:01:27.649 --> 01:01:28.903
Yeah.

01:01:33.206 --> 01:01:34.668
Hey!

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:37.038
You think you're so tough
with your magic wand?

01:01:44.942 --> 01:01:47.197
You're not one of them.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.326
You're one of us.

01:01:50.948 --> 01:01:53.031
Soooo...

01:01:53.054 --> 01:01:55.654
No, I don't.

01:01:55.677 --> 01:01:59.025
I thought I did, but I don't.

01:01:59.785 --> 01:02:01.545
I don't... know.

01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:03.455
Can we just move on?

01:02:03.478 --> 01:02:05.422
He clearly doesn't
know anything.

01:02:05.445 --> 01:02:06.769
Hold on, hold on.

01:02:06.792 --> 01:02:08.080
Actually, this is good.

01:02:08.103 --> 01:02:10.358
This is a perfect example of...

01:02:10.381 --> 01:02:11.221
An idiot?

01:02:11.244 --> 01:02:12.429
A moron.

01:02:12.452 --> 01:02:13.499
Jackass.

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:14.489
Homo.

01:02:15.801 --> 01:02:16.663
No.

01:02:17.803 --> 01:02:19.298
This is a perfect
example of somebody

01:02:19.321 --> 01:02:22.370
who blindly follows the crowd.

01:02:22.393 --> 01:02:24.499
Oooohhhh.

01:02:26.915 --> 01:02:31.886
So, I hate humans because
they won't let me eat them,

01:02:33.232 --> 01:02:35.027
what does that mean?

01:02:35.786 --> 01:02:36.557
What's your name?

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.592
Introduce yourself.

01:02:37.615 --> 01:02:39.272
Oh, I'm Pete.

01:02:39.928 --> 01:02:41.343
I'm purple...

01:02:42.068 --> 01:02:43.552
and I eat people.

01:02:46.245 --> 01:02:48.914
Okay, and do you see how
that could create a problem?

01:02:48.937 --> 01:02:50.813
Yeah, but why should I care?

01:02:50.836 --> 01:02:52.504
They don't care about me.

01:02:52.527 --> 01:02:53.332
He's right.

01:02:53.355 --> 01:02:54.230
It's not fair.

01:02:54.253 --> 01:02:55.196
They hate us.

01:02:55.219 --> 01:02:56.473
They don't treat us fairly,

01:02:56.496 --> 01:02:58.130
so why should we
act any different?

01:02:58.153 --> 01:03:00.374
Because not all
humans are the same,

01:03:00.397 --> 01:03:03.998
just like not all monsters
are the same, you know?

01:03:04.021 --> 01:03:05.413
I mean, sure,
there are bad ones,

01:03:05.436 --> 01:03:08.554
but the point is not to
stoop to their level.

01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:10.384
Oh, so we should do nothing.

01:03:10.407 --> 01:03:11.868
Hm, let me ask you
a question, doc.

01:03:11.891 --> 01:03:13.767
How's that gonna work?

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.976
How is fighting them gonna work?

01:03:15.999 --> 01:03:18.323
It hasn't worked for
anyone anywhere so far,

01:03:18.346 --> 01:03:21.694
and short of killing
all the humans, mm,

01:03:23.765 --> 01:03:26.503
or killing all the
monsters, it won't, alright?

01:03:26.526 --> 01:03:28.954
It's just gonna drive
us further apart.

01:03:28.977 --> 01:03:30.335
Snow cone?

01:03:31.669 --> 01:03:32.498
No.

01:03:34.707 --> 01:03:36.928
I'm gonna guess that none of
you guys felt very confident

01:03:36.951 --> 01:03:38.792
before you ended up here, right,

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.864
that none of you really
accepted yourself.

01:03:41.887 --> 01:03:45.384
We either do what we're
told, or what was easy,

01:03:45.407 --> 01:03:48.387
or what took the attention
off of ourselves.

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:49.791
Fuck off.

01:03:52.898 --> 01:03:55.015
Guys, the problem
isn't with each other,

01:03:55.038 --> 01:03:58.397
the problem is with ourselves.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.872
You know, doc, you
may be onto something.

01:04:03.494 --> 01:04:06.474
I haven't looked in
a mirror since '92.

01:04:06.497 --> 01:04:10.478
Come on, guys, I
know you can do this.

01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:11.986
Can you?

01:04:14.091 --> 01:04:16.174
I think he's right.

01:04:16.197 --> 01:04:20.235
We're all God's creatures.

01:04:23.204 --> 01:04:25.413
I'm sorry, guys.

01:04:26.759 --> 01:04:28.174
Pete.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:32.006
I'm sorry too.

01:04:57.272 --> 01:04:58.492
Yeah.

01:04:58.515 --> 01:05:00.045
Ha ha.

01:05:00.068 --> 01:05:00.897
Yeah.

01:05:26.612 --> 01:05:27.970
See, Bernie?

01:05:27.993 --> 01:05:29.270
We did it.

01:05:29.995 --> 01:05:32.284
Let's not fight anymore.

01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:35.897
Walk out of here
friends, not prisoners.

01:05:37.416 --> 01:05:39.878
Start the trend, buddy.

01:05:39.901 --> 01:05:41.903
The others will follow.

01:06:10.483 --> 01:06:13.912
You know, I'm not
the smartest, doc,

01:06:13.935 --> 01:06:16.087
and I'm okay with that.

01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:20.539
But I find that people who
aren't okay with themselves,

01:06:20.562 --> 01:06:23.922
they tend to take
it out on others.

01:06:23.945 --> 01:06:26.499
You got a good heart, Bernie.

01:06:48.245 --> 01:06:49.246
Oh.

01:07:34.533 --> 01:07:36.270
Hey, Alyss!

01:07:36.293 --> 01:07:37.605
Here I am!

01:07:38.088 --> 01:07:39.135
Mm-hm!

01:07:39.158 --> 01:07:40.332
Come sit down.

01:07:42.161 --> 01:07:43.691
Hey.

01:07:43.714 --> 01:07:45.693
So, why are we here?

01:07:45.716 --> 01:07:47.247
Because I like this place,

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:48.489
and I don't wanna
be eating anywhere

01:07:48.512 --> 01:07:50.526
where they got them
things in the kitchen.

01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:53.356
I agree with you, Finbar, but...

01:07:53.379 --> 01:07:56.256
Can't trust 'em,
just can't trust 'em,

01:07:56.279 --> 01:07:59.523
especially when I have to
talk to you about this.

01:08:08.153 --> 01:08:09.533
Oh, my God.

01:08:10.741 --> 01:08:12.272
It does exist.

01:08:12.295 --> 01:08:13.790
Where did you get this?

01:08:13.813 --> 01:08:14.883
I found it.

01:08:16.332 --> 01:08:18.036
What?

01:08:18.059 --> 01:08:20.452
I was driving to my spin class,
and I had a yeti sighting.

01:08:20.475 --> 01:08:22.890
<i>♪ "Habanera"</i>

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:34.156
I had a feeling way
deep down in my sack,

01:08:34.179 --> 01:08:37.182
and I knew this
could be our chance.

01:08:51.575 --> 01:08:54.210
I spun that son bitch
around real stealth-like,

01:08:54.233 --> 01:08:58.214
pulled a Huey Lewis, and
waited to make my move.

01:08:58.237 --> 01:09:00.630
So I followed them all
the way to their camp,

01:09:00.653 --> 01:09:04.013
marked it on the map,
snapped that there photo,

01:09:04.036 --> 01:09:07.706
and came here for a
nice piece of pie.

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:09.743
Speaking of pie,
where is my pie?

01:09:09.765 --> 01:09:10.778
Nancy!

01:09:10.801 --> 01:09:12.055
Where's my pie?!

01:09:12.078 --> 01:09:12.987
Hm?!

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:14.988
You were actually there?

01:09:15.011 --> 01:09:15.921
Yeah.

01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:18.015
After all these years...

01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:20.685
I really started
to doubt myself.

01:09:20.707 --> 01:09:23.238
I thought this day
would never come.

01:09:23.261 --> 01:09:25.033
The fuck is wrong with you?

01:09:25.057 --> 01:09:26.518
This is good!

01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:29.383
And you're always telling me
that you're the smart one.

01:09:29.406 --> 01:09:31.212
It is, it's just...

01:09:31.236 --> 01:09:33.006
There are so many thoughts

01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:35.044
running through
my head right now.

01:09:35.067 --> 01:09:37.667
I'm finally gonna be
able to get my revenge,

01:09:37.689 --> 01:09:40.636
to do to those monsters
what they did to my family.

01:09:40.658 --> 01:09:42.983
Don't worry your pretty
little head of yours, Alyss.

01:09:43.006 --> 01:09:44.743
Soon you'll be starting
a family of your own.

01:09:44.765 --> 01:09:45.986
The American dream.

01:09:46.009 --> 01:09:47.435
The whole 69 yards.

01:09:47.459 --> 01:09:49.955
I mean, you're getting
married for Pete's sake.

01:09:49.978 --> 01:09:52.337
I just can't believe that
asshole beat me to you.

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:53.545
Hey!

01:09:53.568 --> 01:09:55.823
You haven't even met him yet.

01:09:55.846 --> 01:09:58.378
He's a really great guy.

01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:01.001
So great I don't
even deserve him.

01:10:01.024 --> 01:10:03.785
If he's great, then you do.

01:10:04.924 --> 01:10:06.179
But if he doesn't stop
fighting with you,

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:09.078
I'm gonna stick this
fork up his rectum.

01:10:09.101 --> 01:10:10.275
Mm-hm.

01:10:11.034 --> 01:10:12.254
Right here.

01:10:12.277 --> 01:10:14.900
I think we fight
because we care.

01:10:16.419 --> 01:10:20.331
When I look into his eyes, I
know how he feels about me.

01:10:20.354 --> 01:10:22.264
Ah, those puppy dog eyes.

01:10:22.287 --> 01:10:25.922
Somehow they just make
everything all right.

01:10:25.945 --> 01:10:28.166
Here's your pie, Funbar.

01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:30.064
It's Finbar.

01:10:30.087 --> 01:10:32.653
But only my friends
call me that.

01:10:32.676 --> 01:10:35.553
So I'm just gonna keep
calling you Funbar, then.

01:10:35.576 --> 01:10:37.279
Ah, don't do me
like that, Nancy.

01:10:37.302 --> 01:10:38.694
We're friends!

01:10:38.717 --> 01:10:39.798
Hm.

01:10:39.821 --> 01:10:41.340
Mm, yeah!

01:10:42.479 --> 01:10:43.768
Mm!

01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:46.552
Nice, warm apple pie.

01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:51.362
So delicious in my mouth,
the squishy tenderness,

01:10:51.385 --> 01:10:53.352
goes right down so easy!

01:10:54.319 --> 01:10:55.400
Mm!

01:10:55.423 --> 01:10:56.884
Cinnamon.

01:10:56.907 --> 01:10:57.977
So cinnamony.

01:10:59.427 --> 01:11:01.164
That cinnamon?

01:11:01.187 --> 01:11:02.603
It's pecan pie!

01:11:04.018 --> 01:11:05.157
I know!

01:11:06.365 --> 01:11:09.483
Just a shame they're
killing all them birds.

01:11:09.506 --> 01:11:10.864
Pelican.

01:11:10.887 --> 01:11:12.314
So what's the plan?

01:11:12.337 --> 01:11:14.177
We can't just walk in there.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.351
We need weapons.

01:11:15.374 --> 01:11:16.835
Weapons?!
Shh.

01:11:16.858 --> 01:11:18.768
Maybe we should just slow
down just a little bit.

01:11:18.791 --> 01:11:20.011
We're not ready for this yet.

01:11:20.034 --> 01:11:21.564
What?

01:11:21.587 --> 01:11:23.117
I'm just fucking with ya.

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:24.878
You know, tweaking your tits?

01:11:24.901 --> 01:11:27.639
We're gonna give it to those
dirty rotten monsters tonight,

01:11:27.662 --> 01:11:29.365
right after I excuse my asshole.

01:11:29.388 --> 01:11:31.264
You know, it's been leaking
for about 20 minutes.

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:33.196
I've been sitting
here really patiently,

01:11:33.219 --> 01:11:34.232
and it's dripping
down to my sock.

01:11:34.255 --> 01:11:35.578
I need to change my socks now.

01:11:35.601 --> 01:11:36.786
But I gotta do it right now

01:11:36.809 --> 01:11:37.615
before things get a
little messy down there,

01:11:37.638 --> 01:11:38.443
so I'll be right back.

01:11:38.466 --> 01:11:39.582
Let me just clean up.

01:11:39.605 --> 01:11:40.434
Mm-hm!

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:45.243
Ooh, there it is!

01:11:45.266 --> 01:11:46.302
Mm.

01:11:46.819 --> 01:11:47.406
Mmmmm.

01:11:50.789 --> 01:11:52.940
If you're being held
here against your will,

01:11:52.963 --> 01:11:54.701
just let me know,
I can help you.

01:11:54.724 --> 01:11:56.219
What?

01:11:56.242 --> 01:12:00.603
Just blink twice, I'll make
sure he doesn't touch you.

01:12:00.626 --> 01:12:01.811
No.

01:12:01.834 --> 01:12:04.366
Oh, my God, no,
no, he's my friend.

01:12:04.389 --> 01:12:06.644
Okay, I'm sorry,
but you gotta see

01:12:06.667 --> 01:12:08.979
where I'm coming from, right?

01:12:11.465 --> 01:12:13.858
I mean, I can still
smell him here.

01:12:13.881 --> 01:12:15.031
That's what that is?

01:12:15.054 --> 01:12:17.275
Yeah, it's not good.

01:12:17.298 --> 01:12:20.761
Look, just take this, okay?

01:12:20.784 --> 01:12:22.901
This kid can take care of you

01:12:22.924 --> 01:12:25.996
in case you ever
need protection.

01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:29.391
Pew, guns and shit.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.572
Also, you should call me

01:12:38.595 --> 01:12:41.011
'cause you're really,
really pretty.

01:13:00.583 --> 01:13:02.389
Alright, we're getting
in, we're getting out.

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:05.150
Whatever you do, don't tip
her off about why we're here.

01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:06.669
Alright, but I'm not knocking.

01:13:06.692 --> 01:13:07.877
I knocked at the last house
and it was the wrong place.

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.016
Finbar.

01:13:09.039 --> 01:13:10.155
What?

01:13:10.178 --> 01:13:12.088
You have a way
better knock than I do!

01:13:12.111 --> 01:13:13.250
Okay!

01:13:25.297 --> 01:13:26.586
You think she heard it?

01:13:26.609 --> 01:13:27.656
Mm-hm.
Okay.

01:13:35.065 --> 01:13:36.250
Hi!

01:13:36.273 --> 01:13:37.459
Can I help you?

01:13:37.482 --> 01:13:38.943
Yes, hi, ma'am.

01:13:38.966 --> 01:13:41.037
We are looking for...

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:45.041
an "Eat My Eight Equal
Sign Equal Sign D."

01:13:46.491 --> 01:13:48.470
You wouldn't happen to know
where he is, now would ya?

01:13:48.493 --> 01:13:49.402
What?

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.749
That's the wrong paper.

01:13:51.772 --> 01:13:53.164
Oh, that was from last week.

01:13:53.187 --> 01:13:53.992
But I still need that.

01:13:54.015 --> 01:13:55.269
Thank you.

01:13:55.292 --> 01:13:57.133
We're friends of your son's.

01:13:57.156 --> 01:13:58.549
Oh!

01:13:58.572 --> 01:14:01.483
Well, any friend of Jamie's
is a friend of mine.

01:14:01.506 --> 01:14:03.657
Come on in, I'm making some tea.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.269
Okay, but we can't stay long.

01:14:15.381 --> 01:14:16.521
Tea.

01:14:19.938 --> 01:14:20.766
And you.

01:14:24.356 --> 01:14:25.299
Sugar?

01:14:25.322 --> 01:14:26.910
Yes, please.

01:14:34.435 --> 01:14:35.689
What?

01:14:35.712 --> 01:14:37.611
Better when it's fresh.

01:14:38.784 --> 01:14:40.510
Thank you.

01:14:53.765 --> 01:14:54.593
So...

01:14:58.183 --> 01:14:59.748
How do you know my Jamie?

01:14:59.771 --> 01:15:01.888
Well, we posed nude together
at the community college.

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:07.606
No, no, Finbar, you are
confusing him with someone else.

01:15:09.781 --> 01:15:11.104
No, no, that's definitely it

01:15:11.127 --> 01:15:12.830
Miss Alfredo's class room 111.

01:15:12.853 --> 01:15:14.763
You know, there was a big
incident, the kid touched me.

01:15:14.786 --> 01:15:16.627
Not a big deal...

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:17.904
My gosh!

01:15:19.169 --> 01:15:21.355
Don't mind, Finbar, he
loves to kid around.

01:15:23.657 --> 01:15:24.520
Hm.

01:15:26.038 --> 01:15:26.867
Hm.

01:15:28.489 --> 01:15:30.422
Did you kick me, bitch?

01:15:31.768 --> 01:15:32.574
No.

01:15:34.806 --> 01:15:35.876
That's, um...

01:15:37.705 --> 01:15:41.030
So, where's my homeboy Jamie at?

01:15:41.053 --> 01:15:41.882
Hm?

01:15:43.297 --> 01:15:46.783
I think he's
upstairs in his room.

01:15:48.923 --> 01:15:49.752
Good.

01:15:57.863 --> 01:15:58.692
So...

01:15:59.727 --> 01:16:00.556
Uh...

01:16:03.386 --> 01:16:05.710
Is your husband home?

01:16:05.733 --> 01:16:09.426
Oh, no, honey, he
left us a long time ago.

01:16:15.536 --> 01:16:17.619
Actually, my piece of shit
father left me and my mother

01:16:17.642 --> 01:16:20.161
when I was really young, so...

01:16:21.749 --> 01:16:23.348
I'm so sorry.

01:16:23.371 --> 01:16:25.477
It's so hard on the kids.

01:16:31.207 --> 01:16:34.210
May I ask why you
two would fight?

01:16:36.108 --> 01:16:36.937
Teabag.

01:16:37.972 --> 01:16:39.491
Oh, what's up? Yeah.

01:16:40.216 --> 01:16:41.504
What's up, pussy?

01:16:41.527 --> 01:16:42.989
Who the fuck are you?!

01:16:43.012 --> 01:16:44.611
What?
What's the password?!

01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:45.647
Password?
The password,

01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:47.372
the fucking password!

01:16:47.395 --> 01:16:49.720
You need a password
to get up in this bitch?

01:16:49.743 --> 01:16:50.951
Okay, okay.

01:16:51.814 --> 01:16:53.309
Is it, uh, it's gherkin, right?

01:16:53.332 --> 01:16:54.828
It's gotta be gherkin, hm?
That's not even close.

01:16:54.851 --> 01:16:57.900
Okay, fat boy, let's just
calm ourselves down one minute,

01:16:57.923 --> 01:16:59.350
and I'll come again in a second.

01:16:59.373 --> 01:17:01.835
No, now, fucktard, before
I cut your tongue off

01:17:01.858 --> 01:17:03.906
and I wipe my ass with it.

01:17:03.929 --> 01:17:05.494
Okay, blumpkin!

01:17:05.517 --> 01:17:07.116
Good, right?

01:17:07.139 --> 01:17:08.531
I'm in...
Dude, that's even worse

01:17:08.554 --> 01:17:10.188
than your first guess.

01:17:10.211 --> 01:17:12.501
Okay, listen, I'm here
because someone told me

01:17:12.524 --> 01:17:13.951
that you were the guy to talk to

01:17:13.974 --> 01:17:16.505
for some good ol' fashioned
monster-killing weapons.

01:17:16.528 --> 01:17:17.920
That right?

01:17:17.943 --> 01:17:19.784
I guess you could say that.

01:17:19.807 --> 01:17:21.924
I did say that.

01:17:21.947 --> 01:17:23.535
Would you say that?

01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:26.688
Listen, kind sir, we
desperately need...

01:17:26.711 --> 01:17:28.206
What do you need?

01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:30.243
So we found this camp where
monsters are torturing humans,

01:17:30.266 --> 01:17:31.520
and we need to...

01:17:31.543 --> 01:17:33.246
Use me for my uncanny
ability to fuck shit up

01:17:33.269 --> 01:17:36.939
and make those dirty
bastards squirm?

01:17:36.962 --> 01:17:39.079
Hell yeah, I do!

01:17:39.102 --> 01:17:40.494
Mm-hm!

01:17:40.517 --> 01:17:42.082
Now show me what you got!

01:17:42.105 --> 01:17:43.555
I got blue balls!

01:17:45.591 --> 01:17:46.420
Oh, shit!

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:50.470
You outdid yourself,
little plum.

01:17:50.493 --> 01:17:52.219
Let's get physical.

01:17:54.739 --> 01:17:56.856
You're my hero.

01:17:56.879 --> 01:17:57.707
Mm-hm.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.068
That's really tough, dear.

01:18:02.091 --> 01:18:05.750
But, you know, if he's
as great as he seems,

01:18:07.234 --> 01:18:09.489
I'm sure he'll understand.

01:18:09.512 --> 01:18:10.904
Well, who knows?

01:18:10.927 --> 01:18:12.423
What if he can't handle it?

01:18:12.446 --> 01:18:16.220
What if he thinks I'm crazy
and not a good person?

01:18:16.243 --> 01:18:18.981
Learn from my mistakes.

01:18:19.004 --> 01:18:21.455
Honesty's the best way to go.

01:18:22.663 --> 01:18:24.884
Alright, let's wrap
this shit up, ladies!

01:18:24.907 --> 01:18:26.368
I got a monster to strangle

01:18:26.391 --> 01:18:28.404
and I'm not talking about
the ones at the camp.

01:18:28.427 --> 01:18:31.062
Going out with my friends, Ma!

01:18:31.085 --> 01:18:32.374
You can't wear that.

01:18:32.397 --> 01:18:33.858
Why? I look good.

01:18:33.881 --> 01:18:34.882
No.
Fine.

01:18:38.541 --> 01:18:39.715
We have to go.

01:18:40.854 --> 01:18:43.488
But thank you so
much for the talk.

01:18:43.511 --> 01:18:45.456
It really meant a lot.

01:18:45.479 --> 01:18:47.630
It's my pleasure.

01:18:47.653 --> 01:18:49.310
Hey, jugs!

01:18:51.865 --> 01:18:52.866
Good luck.

01:18:54.281 --> 01:18:55.385
Be safe!

01:19:00.563 --> 01:19:01.368
Ahhh!

01:19:01.391 --> 01:19:02.645
Dammit!

01:19:02.668 --> 01:19:04.682
I mean, a man like you
is ready for anything,

01:19:04.705 --> 01:19:06.891
and you don't think to
carry a can of bug spray?

01:19:06.914 --> 01:19:09.687
I mean, I can kill an
elephant, but not a mosquito.

01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:11.378
Do you ever shut up?

01:19:11.401 --> 01:19:12.655
No!

01:19:12.678 --> 01:19:13.587
They're all over me
and my sweet blood,

01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:15.797
it tastes like penis to them!

01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:16.625
What?

01:19:16.648 --> 01:19:17.868
Penis.

01:19:17.891 --> 01:19:20.353
I taste like penis to
these little suckers.

01:19:20.376 --> 01:19:21.492
What is wrong with him?

01:19:21.515 --> 01:19:23.114
What, you don't get it?

01:19:23.137 --> 01:19:24.357
It's like that movie.

01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:25.807
You ever see James
and the Giant Penis?

01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:27.498
You know, there's a big penis,
everyone sees the penis,

01:19:27.521 --> 01:19:29.086
they say, "Wow,
what a big penis."

01:19:29.109 --> 01:19:30.294
Then the penis flies
away, and they say,

01:19:30.317 --> 01:19:31.813
"Where'd the big penis go?"

01:19:31.836 --> 01:19:34.263
Then it comes back and they
start nibbling on the penis,

01:19:34.286 --> 01:19:35.471
and then they sing Kumbaya.

01:19:35.494 --> 01:19:36.576
It's a cult classic.

01:19:36.599 --> 01:19:38.371
I watch it every night.

01:19:38.394 --> 01:19:40.925
Last Tuesday, I gave it
a standing masturbation.

01:19:40.948 --> 01:19:43.686
So, you're saying peaches?

01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:45.619
Yes, peaches.

01:19:45.642 --> 01:19:46.966
Peaches.

01:19:46.989 --> 01:19:48.415
Yes, peaches.

01:19:48.438 --> 01:19:51.246
Okay, then we're
settled on peaches.

01:19:51.269 --> 01:19:52.454
Yeah, peaches.

01:19:52.477 --> 01:19:53.754
You know...

01:19:54.341 --> 01:19:55.618
...like cock.

01:20:01.037 --> 01:20:02.844
Right through this
clearing over here.

01:20:02.867 --> 01:20:05.283
That's where I followed
that fat son bitch.

01:20:07.595 --> 01:20:08.873
Set up.

01:20:13.394 --> 01:20:14.948
Almost midnight.

01:20:23.957 --> 01:20:25.349
Start cracking some skulls.

01:20:25.372 --> 01:20:27.420
We need to wait for
our window of attack.

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:31.631
Yeah, I got that son
bitch right in the eye!

01:20:31.654 --> 01:20:33.115
Bernie!

01:20:33.138 --> 01:20:34.323
That's a bullseye!

01:20:34.346 --> 01:20:36.107
He didn't see that coming.

01:20:37.936 --> 01:20:39.052
Wait a minute.

01:20:41.664 --> 01:20:43.539
There's humans down there.

01:20:43.562 --> 01:20:44.356
What?

01:21:02.754 --> 01:21:03.594
Oh, my God!

01:21:03.617 --> 01:21:04.549
He ate him!

01:21:05.688 --> 01:21:06.873
He fucking ate him!

01:21:11.797 --> 01:21:12.845
It's gametime, guys.

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:14.214
Let's do this!

01:21:14.939 --> 01:21:15.848
You heard him.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:17.332
It's gametime!

01:21:17.355 --> 01:21:20.093
That's what he said,
it's gametime, baby!

01:21:20.116 --> 01:21:21.681
Oh, shit!

01:22:01.709 --> 01:22:04.367
What is happening to my camp?!

01:22:08.751 --> 01:22:09.867
Get up, Boogey!

01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:11.892
Get up and fix this now!

01:22:15.344 --> 01:22:17.518
My prisoners are escaping!

01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:20.395
Go!

01:22:20.418 --> 01:22:21.223
Christ!

01:22:21.246 --> 01:22:22.569
Every time!

01:22:30.083 --> 01:22:31.475
Yeah!

01:22:31.498 --> 01:22:33.718
Run, you son of a bitches, run!

01:22:33.741 --> 01:22:35.203
I'll kill you all!

01:22:37.814 --> 01:22:38.643
Hm.

01:22:40.472 --> 01:22:43.245
I think I'm outta bullets.

01:22:44.166 --> 01:22:44.867
Hm.

01:22:44.890 --> 01:22:45.938
Oh, no, you don't!

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:47.560
Come to papa!

01:22:47.583 --> 01:22:49.700
No!
Shut up, shut up!

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.669
Yeah, shh, shh!

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.052
You know you smell like shit?

01:22:57.075 --> 01:22:58.985
No, I think that's you.

01:22:59.008 --> 01:23:00.228
Really?

01:23:00.251 --> 01:23:01.194
Yeah.

01:23:02.425 --> 01:23:03.334
Bitch!

01:23:03.357 --> 01:23:04.439
What's going on?

01:23:04.462 --> 01:23:07.028
Go, Mama, go!

01:23:07.051 --> 01:23:09.340
Mama, go!
Bloody hell!

01:23:09.363 --> 01:23:11.227
It's worse than I thought!

01:23:12.401 --> 01:23:13.413
Here, don't let them catch you!

01:23:13.436 --> 01:23:15.956
Shoot yourself if you have to!

01:23:20.892 --> 01:23:22.664
Look who it is.

01:23:22.687 --> 01:23:24.148
You.

01:23:32.076 --> 01:23:33.525
Don't you say it.

01:23:35.286 --> 01:23:36.701
Don't you say it!

01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:39.992
Frankenstein.

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:42.132
You son of a bitch!

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:47.965
<i>♪ "Ave Maria"</i>

01:23:47.988 --> 01:23:52.993
<i>♪ "Ave Maria"</i>

01:24:02.416 --> 01:24:05.603
Can we get a hand for
Frankenstein over here?

01:24:05.626 --> 01:24:07.019
Anybody, huh?

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.089
You?

01:24:08.112 --> 01:24:09.469
No?

01:24:09.492 --> 01:24:10.263
Alright.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.606
Come on, tough guy.

01:24:20.676 --> 01:24:22.022
Schmuck.

01:24:23.748 --> 01:24:24.680
You schmuck.

01:24:29.616 --> 01:24:30.755
No!

01:24:35.967 --> 01:24:37.739
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

01:24:38.625 --> 01:24:39.430
Oh my God!

01:24:39.453 --> 01:24:40.397
Ahhh!

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:41.501
I'm an animal!

01:24:41.524 --> 01:24:42.675
I'm an animal!

01:24:42.698 --> 01:24:44.125
I'm gonna eat ya.

01:24:44.148 --> 01:24:45.126
You're gonna eat me?

01:24:45.149 --> 01:24:46.748
I'm gonna eat you too!

01:25:11.244 --> 01:25:13.361
What did you do to Nick?!

01:25:27.846 --> 01:25:29.400
Finally complete.

01:25:31.195 --> 01:25:32.023
Perfect.

01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:36.418
Wolf!

01:25:36.441 --> 01:25:38.788
Fuck!

01:25:46.658 --> 01:25:47.291
Who is this guy?

01:25:47.314 --> 01:25:48.419
He's gone mad!

01:25:49.282 --> 01:25:50.398
What are you doing, man?

01:25:50.421 --> 01:25:51.744
The humans are killing us.

01:25:51.767 --> 01:25:53.401
We need your help!

01:25:53.424 --> 01:25:55.713
This sand is ridiculous.

01:25:55.736 --> 01:25:58.268
Why can't I just
do it with a wand?

01:26:08.232 --> 01:26:09.865
Ha!

01:26:17.206 --> 01:26:20.830
You could've just taken
one handful outta the bag.

01:26:21.555 --> 01:26:23.845
Crazy! Crazy!

01:26:23.868 --> 01:26:24.777
You want my balls?

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.019
You want my big fat dick?

01:26:26.042 --> 01:26:28.090
You want my big,
fat purple dick?

01:26:28.113 --> 01:26:29.667
Let my sister go!

01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:31.991
What?

01:26:32.014 --> 01:26:33.118
Let her go!

01:26:35.328 --> 01:26:36.685
Alright.

01:26:36.708 --> 01:26:38.204
You run along now, Missy.

01:26:38.227 --> 01:26:39.895
I'm gonna deal with
the uglier one first.

01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:45.729
Just because you're
extremely handsome,

01:26:45.752 --> 01:26:48.007
doesn't mean you can
treat us like that.

01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:50.423
Listen here,
purple nurple, okay?

01:26:50.446 --> 01:26:52.874
I'm a full-blown
women's advocate.

01:26:52.897 --> 01:26:54.462
I don't fight the females,

01:26:54.485 --> 01:26:56.291
so why don't you just
go on with your way

01:26:56.314 --> 01:26:58.949
and I'll go on my way,
back into the forest,

01:26:58.972 --> 01:27:01.158
and I'll head home, we'll
never see each other again.

01:27:01.181 --> 01:27:02.263
Okay? Sounds good?

01:27:03.114 --> 01:27:04.092
Hoo, hoo.

01:27:04.115 --> 01:27:05.266
You like that?

01:27:05.289 --> 01:27:06.922
Uncle Finbar delivered
you some medicine.

01:27:06.945 --> 01:27:08.338
Hm? You like it?

01:27:08.361 --> 01:27:09.753
Hm?

01:27:09.776 --> 01:27:11.996
Looks like you did
'cause you're speechless.

01:27:12.019 --> 01:27:12.928
Ha ha.

01:27:14.919 --> 01:27:16.277
My peppers.

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:18.279
My sweet sausage and peppers.

01:27:18.302 --> 01:27:19.130
You bitch!

01:27:22.582 --> 01:27:24.687
Was that you or me?

01:27:26.827 --> 01:27:27.840
You're so dirty!

01:27:27.863 --> 01:27:29.221
Oh, my God, yeah!

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:30.083
Oh, shit!

01:27:30.106 --> 01:27:31.153
That's right!

01:27:31.176 --> 01:27:33.248
Ohhh! Ah..

01:27:35.422 --> 01:27:36.423
My gooch!

01:27:38.356 --> 01:27:40.749
My gooch, you destroyed it.

01:27:40.772 --> 01:27:42.268
That's my precious area.

01:27:43.948 --> 01:27:44.776
You fuck!

01:27:46.330 --> 01:27:48.792
I hope you're enjoying
last breathe of air!

01:28:26.956 --> 01:28:27.957
And now...

01:28:29.062 --> 01:28:31.098
I want to suck...

01:28:31.685 --> 01:28:33.377
your dick.

01:28:56.710 --> 01:28:57.861
What the hell?!

01:28:57.884 --> 01:28:59.403
What'd you do that for?!

01:29:00.404 --> 01:29:01.520
Months!

01:29:01.543 --> 01:29:03.268
Months I've waited for this.

01:29:13.589 --> 01:29:15.085
What are you doing here, porky?

01:29:17.973 --> 01:29:21.678
There's a big bad wolf outside!

01:29:21.701 --> 01:29:23.841
Oh, shut up!

01:29:24.428 --> 01:29:26.130
Are we safe?

01:29:26.153 --> 01:29:27.891
I think we're good.

01:29:27.914 --> 01:29:31.653
We'll just wait for
all this to blow over.

01:29:31.676 --> 01:29:33.368
Hold me.

01:29:40.444 --> 01:29:41.272
Mm.

01:29:46.311 --> 01:29:48.118
Hey!
Whoa!

01:29:48.141 --> 01:29:50.051
Whoa, I didn't see that there.

01:29:50.074 --> 01:29:52.674
You got all that
foliage and whatnot.

01:29:53.871 --> 01:29:55.263
Okay, okay.

01:29:55.286 --> 01:29:57.507
It's just one dude touching
another dude's junk.

01:29:59.532 --> 01:30:00.395
No!

01:30:01.292 --> 01:30:02.339
Oh, my God!

01:30:02.362 --> 01:30:04.399
Spare me you fat bastard!

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:08.057
Please, I'll buy you enchiladas!

01:30:09.887 --> 01:30:11.486
I'm begging you, please!

01:30:21.174 --> 01:30:21.979
Whoa!

01:30:51.135 --> 01:30:52.170
Don't move.

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:55.346
Get off him, you beast.

01:30:56.278 --> 01:30:58.556
Come on, I know you hear me!

01:31:00.006 --> 01:31:03.803
Let him go, or I swear I
won't hesitate to kill you.

01:31:13.122 --> 01:31:14.261
Now leave.

01:31:17.817 --> 01:31:18.645
Go!

01:31:20.992 --> 01:31:21.993
Come on, go!

01:31:23.063 --> 01:31:24.340
Don't tempt me!

01:31:25.341 --> 01:31:27.389
Come on, all of you monsters!

01:31:27.412 --> 01:31:28.701
Get out of here, leave!

01:31:28.724 --> 01:31:30.070
Never come back!

01:31:32.625 --> 01:31:34.765
You got it all wrong.

01:31:35.386 --> 01:31:36.111
Shut up!

01:31:50.435 --> 01:31:51.402
It can't be!

01:32:31.338 --> 01:32:33.444
Ooooh.

01:32:36.481 --> 01:32:38.380
I know that cracker.

01:32:55.155 --> 01:32:55.949
Nick?

01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:57.744
Hey.

01:32:59.884 --> 01:33:01.576
I almost killed you.

01:33:03.647 --> 01:33:05.142
You're a werewolf?!

01:33:05.165 --> 01:33:06.868
Yeah, look, I've been
meaning to tell you that.

01:33:06.891 --> 01:33:08.283
Were you?!

01:33:08.306 --> 01:33:09.940
I was worried about
how you'd react,

01:33:09.963 --> 01:33:12.103
and I still kinda am.

01:33:13.277 --> 01:33:14.151
Wait a minute, let
me get this straight.

01:33:14.174 --> 01:33:15.290
You two know each other?

01:33:15.313 --> 01:33:17.488
He's my fiancee.

01:33:18.696 --> 01:33:19.559
Damn.

01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:22.263
Oh, really?

01:33:22.286 --> 01:33:23.114
Nick.

01:33:23.977 --> 01:33:25.197
Gross.

01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:27.233
So now you're being honest.

01:33:27.256 --> 01:33:30.340
I am always honest
with you, Nick.

01:33:30.363 --> 01:33:35.368
That's why I felt so terrible
about keeping it from you!

01:33:36.576 --> 01:33:38.072
It was wrong of me
to be so selfish.

01:33:38.095 --> 01:33:39.556
But you're a fucking werewolf!

01:33:39.579 --> 01:33:41.247
And you hunt us.

01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:42.076
No, listen...

01:33:42.099 --> 01:33:43.595
No, you listen, okay?

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:46.114
Look, I've always had
trouble accepting who I am,

01:33:46.137 --> 01:33:47.737
and I thought that
you were gonna have

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.359
trouble accepting it as well.

01:33:49.382 --> 01:33:51.142
Clearly, I was right.

01:33:53.524 --> 01:33:55.008
No more secrets.

01:34:12.474 --> 01:34:16.248
I can't keep you bottled
up if you don't wanna be.

01:34:16.271 --> 01:34:17.272
Dr. Cole?!

01:34:23.105 --> 01:34:24.532
Nicholas?!

01:34:24.555 --> 01:34:25.602
Dad?!

01:34:25.625 --> 01:34:26.879
Dad?!

01:34:26.902 --> 01:34:27.708
My goodness.

01:34:27.731 --> 01:34:28.985
Alyssa, is that you?

01:34:29.008 --> 01:34:30.262
Wait, he's your father?!

01:34:30.285 --> 01:34:31.159
You know him?!

01:34:31.182 --> 01:34:32.436
We work together!

01:34:32.459 --> 01:34:34.473
You work with my dad,
and you didn't tell me?!

01:34:34.496 --> 01:34:35.716
You can't hold that against me!

01:34:35.739 --> 01:34:36.958
I just found this out!

01:34:36.981 --> 01:34:38.788
You work with my fiancee?!

01:34:38.811 --> 01:34:40.721
My Ally is the one
that you've been having

01:34:40.744 --> 01:34:42.136
problems with lately?!

01:34:42.159 --> 01:34:44.759
I am not your anything!

01:34:44.782 --> 01:34:46.174
You told him?!

01:34:46.197 --> 01:34:47.003
A little.

01:34:47.026 --> 01:34:48.660
You told me he was dead!

01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:50.454
You killed me?

01:34:50.477 --> 01:34:52.698
That may not have
been entirely true.

01:34:52.721 --> 01:34:54.079
Really? Hm.

01:34:54.102 --> 01:34:55.149
I know.

01:34:55.172 --> 01:34:56.737
I know, really bad timing,

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:59.463
but that's the last
lie, I promise.

01:34:59.486 --> 01:35:00.879
Nick, I'm sorry.

01:35:00.902 --> 01:35:03.675
Honey, you're so beautiful,
and you're all grown up.

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:04.952
Don't you come near me.

01:35:04.975 --> 01:35:06.816
Honey, let's just calm down.

01:35:06.839 --> 01:35:08.507
Just tell me what's going on.

01:35:10.325 --> 01:35:13.466
Your friend, Dr. Cole,

01:35:15.330 --> 01:35:17.896
abandoned me and my mother.

01:35:17.919 --> 01:35:19.760
Well, it wasn't like that.

01:35:19.783 --> 01:35:22.486
I mean, her mother and
I were having problems.

01:35:22.509 --> 01:35:24.385
I was a child.

01:35:24.408 --> 01:35:26.525
You ruined our lives.

01:35:26.548 --> 01:35:27.975
I know.

01:35:27.998 --> 01:35:30.253
And I can see nothing's changed.

01:35:30.276 --> 01:35:32.393
You still got a case
of beer riding shotgun.

01:35:32.416 --> 01:35:34.015
No, no, no, I'm sober.

01:35:34.038 --> 01:35:36.316
I'm so... Well, a
couple of beers.

01:35:37.524 --> 01:35:41.666
You have to understand,
when I left your mother,

01:35:42.391 --> 01:35:44.232
I was in a bad place.

01:35:44.255 --> 01:35:47.235
Okay, so you left the bad place,

01:35:47.258 --> 01:35:50.238
where your family who depended
on you just happened to be,

01:35:50.261 --> 01:35:52.206
to run off to what?!

01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:55.830
Live happily ever after
with some fish you caught?!

01:35:55.853 --> 01:35:57.648
Alyssa, sweetheart.

01:35:58.925 --> 01:36:00.801
He left us to rot!

01:36:00.824 --> 01:36:02.009
You didn't care how I felt!

01:36:02.032 --> 01:36:04.482
You didn't care how Mom felt!

01:36:05.587 --> 01:36:07.739
I was a coward.

01:36:17.357 --> 01:36:20.982
Coward! Is an understatement.

01:36:21.603 --> 01:36:22.684
Hildie?!

01:36:22.707 --> 01:36:24.100
What are you doing here?

01:36:24.123 --> 01:36:25.480
You know her?!

01:36:25.503 --> 01:36:26.792
You know her?

01:36:26.815 --> 01:36:29.266
What, you speak?!

01:36:30.405 --> 01:36:34.996
Oh, my dearest
Stanley, tell them.

01:36:36.652 --> 01:36:40.461
Well, we used to be
friends in high school.

01:36:40.484 --> 01:36:41.807
Friends?

01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:44.465
Friends, that's
what you'd call us?

01:36:44.488 --> 01:36:46.191
Ohh, Hildie!

01:36:46.214 --> 01:36:50.471
I would've given
up forever... for you.

01:36:50.494 --> 01:36:52.369
It's okay, Madam Hildie.

01:36:52.392 --> 01:36:55.165
We have Esmeralda back.

01:36:55.188 --> 01:36:58.720
We'll finally have some peace
on the reservation again.

01:36:58.743 --> 01:37:03.334
Plus, it seems to me that he
didn't even mean it, right?

01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:05.198
Right?

01:37:06.441 --> 01:37:08.247
It's true!

01:37:14.069 --> 01:37:16.152
It's not true!

01:37:16.175 --> 01:37:18.763
Anyone else care to speak up?

01:37:21.352 --> 01:37:23.527
I didn't think so.

01:37:25.149 --> 01:37:29.774
Did you all think I
did this for her?!

01:37:33.917 --> 01:37:35.401
Of course you did.

01:37:36.402 --> 01:37:37.955
Pathetic!

01:37:38.922 --> 01:37:40.406
Personally...

01:37:41.717 --> 01:37:44.755
I would've rather
him killed the bitch!

01:37:45.721 --> 01:37:48.046
Okay, okay, relax now, Hildie!

01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:55.087
Jesus Christ, wait, wait!

01:37:56.249 --> 01:37:57.987
Okay, okay, Jesus!

01:37:58.010 --> 01:37:58.873
Shit!

01:38:01.254 --> 01:38:03.636
Just a...

01:38:05.949 --> 01:38:07.951
You're on your own, buddy.

01:38:10.781 --> 01:38:12.484
That's okay, Stanley!

01:38:12.507 --> 01:38:13.623
Run away!

01:38:13.646 --> 01:38:15.130
What else is new?!

01:38:19.859 --> 01:38:20.699
Shoot her.

01:38:20.722 --> 01:38:21.907
If there any
bullets in this gun,

01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:23.150
I would've shot
you 10 minutes ago.

01:38:23.173 --> 01:38:23.898
Dammit.

01:38:25.209 --> 01:38:26.291
Ma'am, let's just...

01:38:26.314 --> 01:38:27.729
Nick!

01:38:28.454 --> 01:38:30.905
You're coming with me!

01:38:32.216 --> 01:38:34.816
Let's see if your
beautiful baby girl

01:38:34.839 --> 01:38:37.681
can force you to be a man!

01:38:44.401 --> 01:38:47.473
You could've been half witch.

01:38:48.198 --> 01:38:49.026
Hildie!

01:38:50.752 --> 01:38:52.765
Let my daughter go!

01:38:52.788 --> 01:38:54.836
Oh, this should be good.

01:38:54.859 --> 01:38:56.908
Don't hurt her!

01:38:56.931 --> 01:38:58.806
Now, your problem's with me!

01:38:58.829 --> 01:39:00.382
Here I am, take me!

01:39:02.143 --> 01:39:03.638
I'm all yours!

01:39:03.661 --> 01:39:04.593
Let her go!

01:39:27.789 --> 01:39:28.617
Whoa!

01:39:33.519 --> 01:39:36.913
Let me tell you, you
haven't aged very well.

01:39:44.185 --> 01:39:45.163
Daddy!

01:39:54.057 --> 01:39:56.162
Ahhwww.

01:40:00.477 --> 01:40:01.305
Ally!

01:40:03.135 --> 01:40:06.149
Whatever happens, I love you!

01:40:06.172 --> 01:40:10.498
Never stopped loving you
since the day you were born!

01:40:10.521 --> 01:40:13.985
You thought you
could run from me,

01:40:14.008 --> 01:40:15.802
but, oh...

01:40:16.527 --> 01:40:18.943
how you were wrong.

01:40:21.912 --> 01:40:24.202
What are you laughing at?

01:40:24.225 --> 01:40:25.824
You think this
will make you happy?

01:40:25.847 --> 01:40:27.619
You're wrong.

01:40:27.642 --> 01:40:30.967
You've been hating
humans your entire life,

01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:34.235
and in reality, you
only hated yourself.

01:40:35.132 --> 01:40:36.996
We're no different.

01:40:38.722 --> 01:40:40.379
That was touching.

01:40:41.345 --> 01:40:44.498
Anything else... before you die?!

01:40:47.144 --> 01:40:49.089
You gave a great blowjob.

01:41:17.864 --> 01:41:19.084
Why'd you do that?

01:41:19.107 --> 01:41:21.247
I don't deserve your help.

01:41:22.455 --> 01:41:23.606
Yes, you do.

01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:27.299
I see, now, that you're
a really good man,

01:41:27.322 --> 01:41:29.646
and you deserve a second chance.

01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:33.443
All these years, why
didn't you say something?

01:41:33.466 --> 01:41:35.813
Because you're an asshole.

01:41:36.849 --> 01:41:39.070
Daddy.
Oh, sweetheart.

01:41:39.093 --> 01:41:40.623
I love you.

01:41:40.646 --> 01:41:41.451
Oh, I, ow!

01:41:41.474 --> 01:41:43.004
Ow.
Oh!

01:41:43.027 --> 01:41:44.937
Oh, my gosh, you're bleeding!
Yeah, yeah, it's all right.

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:46.284
Here, right here.
Oh.

01:41:46.307 --> 01:41:47.837
Hold that.
From now on,

01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:51.392
I'm gonna be there for
you and for Nicholas.

01:41:51.415 --> 01:41:52.658
Thanks, Stan.

01:41:53.762 --> 01:41:55.258
No, no, I...
No, I'm so sorry.

01:41:55.281 --> 01:41:56.248
I'm sorry.

01:41:58.077 --> 01:41:59.113
I love you.

01:42:16.337 --> 01:42:18.730
I've been waiting my
whole life for this.

01:42:18.753 --> 01:42:22.492
Well, turns out
I'm a terrible shot,

01:42:22.515 --> 01:42:24.931
but I think everybody's okay.

01:42:26.036 --> 01:42:28.280
Everyone except Bernie.

01:42:30.903 --> 01:42:32.146
Who's Bernie?

01:42:36.702 --> 01:42:38.267
Oh, him.

01:42:38.290 --> 01:42:39.636
Yeah, he's dead.

01:42:40.464 --> 01:42:41.891
He's very dead.

01:42:41.914 --> 01:42:43.513
So don't you wish
you came along with me

01:42:43.536 --> 01:42:46.781
instead of eating that
shit-flavored snow cone?

01:42:48.092 --> 01:42:49.001
I don't know.

01:42:49.024 --> 01:42:51.625
I think things turned out okay.

01:42:51.648 --> 01:42:53.420
You know him too?

01:42:53.443 --> 01:42:54.904
No, he...

01:42:54.927 --> 01:42:57.562
This son of a bitch
didn't wanna sit on my face.

01:42:57.585 --> 01:42:58.632
What's the big deal, Nick?

01:42:58.655 --> 01:43:00.323
I sit on his face all the time.

01:43:00.346 --> 01:43:01.359
Excuse me?!

01:43:01.382 --> 01:43:02.601
Oh.
It's seat covers.

01:43:02.624 --> 01:43:04.155
We were talking
about seat covers.

01:43:04.178 --> 01:43:05.880
He offered me a ride when I
was heading up to my cabin.

01:43:05.903 --> 01:43:08.814
Ah, the cabin where you
work your overnight shifts.

01:43:08.837 --> 01:43:10.471
Yes, and by overnight shifts,

01:43:10.494 --> 01:43:11.955
if you mean to chain myself up

01:43:11.978 --> 01:43:14.234
and keep everyone safe
until morning, then yes.

01:43:14.257 --> 01:43:16.259
It's actually a
really nice place.

01:43:17.018 --> 01:43:18.502
Sounds like a party.

01:43:20.263 --> 01:43:21.310
No more hiding.

01:43:21.333 --> 01:43:22.518
Mm.

01:43:22.541 --> 01:43:24.278
We're still gonna
keep the chains, right?

01:43:24.301 --> 01:43:26.004
Yes...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:43:26.027 --> 01:43:28.248
Look, I'm glad that you and
Nick have found each other

01:43:28.271 --> 01:43:31.458
and all of that, but
please no more chained up,

01:43:31.481 --> 01:43:33.770
sit on my face slumber
party conversation

01:43:33.793 --> 01:43:35.427
around me, alright?

01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:36.946
Will do, sir.

01:43:36.969 --> 01:43:38.810
I think I'm gonna take
that week and go fishing.

01:43:38.833 --> 01:43:40.363
Oh, yeah, promise is a promise.

01:43:40.386 --> 01:43:42.331
Yeah, I think maybe two.

01:43:42.354 --> 01:43:43.769
Maybe two.
Sure.

01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:46.127
Hey, I'm starving!

01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:47.577
Who wants to eat?!

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:49.096
I know this great little place

01:43:49.119 --> 01:43:50.477
with some nice penis cobbler.

01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:51.892
It's delicious!

01:43:51.915 --> 01:43:53.134
You know what else I like?

01:43:53.157 --> 01:43:55.240
You guys ever been
to Loch Ness Tavern?

01:43:55.263 --> 01:43:58.139
They have great Haitian food!

01:43:58.162 --> 01:44:00.038
Is anyone even listening to me?

01:44:00.061 --> 01:44:01.752
It's because I'm
black, isn't it?

01:44:03.202 --> 01:44:06.240
Uh, can someone please put
me back in the fucking lake?!
