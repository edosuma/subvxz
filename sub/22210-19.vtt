00:02.211 --> 00:06.171
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.256 --> 00:09.124
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.384 --> 00:12.172
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.262 --> 00:15.005
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:17.219
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.392 --> 00:20.180
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:23.388
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

00:23.607 --> 00:26.145
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

00:26.235 --> 00:28.477
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:30.937
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:31.031 --> 00:34.024
Not a ghost.
I'm Leo Snart from Earth-X.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.949
- I didn't do anything!
- I understand.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.823
But your radioactivity is dangerous.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.160
You are part of this team.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.994
And I'm the only one with a body
that DeVoe is trying to snatch.

00:45.170 --> 00:48.629
Now, you will die for me.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.091
Melt.

00:52.511 --> 00:53.968
- Killer Frost...
- Is gone.

00:54.221 --> 00:57.589
<i>My new host body holds
an ancillary benefit.</i>

00:57.849 --> 00:59.556
Dark matter siphoned from the room

00:59.643 --> 01:02.636
where Dr. Wells was charging
his counterfeit cap.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.595
Maximum capacity, now!

01:09.611 --> 01:10.647
Again.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.195
Dr. Wells, the odds of a different
conclusion are extremely low.

01:13.282 --> 01:15.820
- Run it again.
- Yes, Dr. Wells.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.203
Same results, Dr. Wells.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.916
The excessive infusion of dark matter
into your neural system,

01:25.002 --> 01:26.459
has disrupted the area of the brain

01:26.545 --> 01:28.912
where general intelligence
and executive function occur.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.878
My ability to integrate information
is declining.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.261
I'm losing my intelligence.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.179
At some point soon,
you'll need to re-learn

01:39.266 --> 01:41.929
everything you've ever known.

01:42.019 --> 01:45.888
Is there a way to use the
thinking cap to reverse this process?

01:45.981 --> 01:47.222
Unlikely, Dr. Wells.

01:47.316 --> 01:50.650
Your thinking cap and the dark matter
is what caused this.

01:50.861 --> 01:54.855
- I tried to caution restraint...
- I know!

01:55.782 --> 01:59.571
Gideon, how long
before everything I know

02:00.537 --> 02:01.994
is gone?

02:06.460 --> 02:09.328
You know, it's only been
a couple of days since he died,

02:11.882 --> 02:13.839
but it still doesn't feel real.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.125
How close were you with Ralph?

02:16.553 --> 02:18.545
We were becoming close.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.473
Yeah, it took me a while

02:22.559 --> 02:25.643
to see past the things
that I didn't like when we first met,

02:25.729 --> 02:26.970
but after a while,

02:27.189 --> 02:29.522
I started to see what a good guy
he was.

02:30.067 --> 02:33.231
Started to see the hero
that he became.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.652
You consider him a hero?

02:35.030 --> 02:37.693
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.650
What about you, Barry?
How are you feeling?

02:40.744 --> 02:45.330
I'm fine. I mean, you know,
I'm working through it.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.874
So, you weren't
as close to him as Iris was?

02:48.210 --> 02:51.123
No. I mean, we were about the same,
I'd say.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.580
They used to work together.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.797
- Oh?
- Yeah.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.378
And you're fine already
with his death?

02:59.471 --> 03:01.963
I've dealt with a lot of death
in my life.

03:02.224 --> 03:04.090
Yes, you have.

03:04.184 --> 03:08.804
Your mother, father, Eddie,
Ronnie, H.R.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.434
Has Ralph's death had any impact
on you at all?

03:15.278 --> 03:20.524
I think I just know
how to deal with death now,

03:20.617 --> 03:23.860
so, it doesn't affect me
as much as it once did.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.198
All right,
I guess we'll pick this up later.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.452
Yeah.

03:30.961 --> 03:34.921
- Same time next week?
- Or before, if you need.

03:35.132 --> 03:38.671
Barry, grief is a complex emotion,

03:38.760 --> 03:41.798
that as you know
deals on its own terms.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.259
There is no practice makes perfect.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.768
Thirsty, my love?

04:03.326 --> 04:04.316
You're happy?

04:04.411 --> 04:07.199
More than I've been in a long time,
my love.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.330
To your return.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.250
- I never left you, Marlize.
- It felt like you had.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.747
Those days are past us now.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.579
All our sacrifice, our commitment,
our planning,

04:18.175 --> 04:21.509
everything is as it was and more.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.215
There's been no decline
in your metabolic processes

04:24.306 --> 04:25.672
since your last transference.

04:26.183 --> 04:31.099
My mind, my abilities,
these elasticized cells,

04:31.480 --> 04:34.473
can hold another bus full
of meta-humans powers,

04:34.566 --> 04:36.023
and I still wouldn't be affected.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.600
It gives me peace, Clifford.

04:38.612 --> 04:42.731
I need your mind focused
for what happens next.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.656
- We start today?
- Yes.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.205
But we have time, my love.

04:51.374 --> 04:55.914
Could we not spend time together
as husband and wife?

04:56.171 --> 05:01.383
- I think...
- Hmm! That is your first mistake.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.676
Leave the thinking to me.

05:28.954 --> 05:32.368
Whoa! Stop! Don't bother.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.164
- It doesn't work.
- I don't know about that.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.868
Yeah, well, I know about it. I'm the
guy who wore it on his head.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.919
It helped you gain ground
on DeVoe, didn't it?

05:39.256 --> 05:41.464
Mapping the pocket dimensions,
building the Scepter.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.962
We stopped you from using it,
right when we needed it most,

05:44.052 --> 05:45.418
when Ralph got...

05:50.976 --> 05:52.137
We thought you were addicted.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.973
We shouldn't have stopped you.
We were wrong.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.971
That's not... You know,
you weren't wrong.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.187
No, I was addicted.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.860
Yeah. It was stupid
when you think about it.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.357
Because I'm a pretty smart guy.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.564
How much smarter is
this intelligence booster making me?

06:06.658 --> 06:09.366
10%? I think we both agree that

06:09.452 --> 06:12.695
DeVoe is at least
twice as smart as that.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.655
Then maybe
I should get to wear it, too.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.999
Okay, no. No.

06:21.172 --> 06:25.007
This thing would never work on you
because I specifically designed

06:25.093 --> 06:27.676
this to stimulate my brain waves.
My brain waves, not yours, okay?

06:27.762 --> 06:30.129
- My cerebral firings, okay?
- Harry! Harry!

06:30.223 --> 06:33.182
I'm saying we should build
a second thinking cap.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.429
- Intelligence booster.
- For me.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.221
- For, for you?
- Yes, for me.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.147
Think about it.
Two heads are better than one.

06:40.609 --> 06:44.068
Your ideas, my ideas,
put 'em together, we combine them,

06:44.154 --> 06:46.988
we build upon each others ideas.
Harry, with two caps...

06:47.949 --> 06:49.611
With two caps, we can get DeVoe.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.122
Okay. Get on it.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.493
Melt.

07:02.714 --> 07:03.921
Anything new?

07:04.507 --> 07:05.714
No sign of DeVoe.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.421
I meant with you.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.885
No. No cold signatures
anywhere in the city.

07:12.974 --> 07:16.433
Killer Frost is nowhere to be found.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.683
That doesn't make sense. DeVoe
created every bus meta for a reason.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.481
I mean, he had no
interest in Barry's powers,

07:22.567 --> 07:24.729
or Cisco's,
or any of the metas at Iron Heights,

07:24.819 --> 07:26.902
so, I don't know
why he would suddenly want yours.

07:26.988 --> 07:31.153
We all saw what happened. When DeVoe
touched me, my powers disappeared.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.449
Had to be him.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.037
DeVoe?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.699
Satellite's picking up three
different pocket dimensions

07:39.793 --> 07:41.455
opening in Keystone. That's each...

07:42.796 --> 07:44.287
All right, you and me, all right.
Let's go.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.589
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.
They all just closed.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.500
- What?
- Hmm.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.923
Wrong coordinates.
Maybe, he made a mistake.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.677
He doesn't make mistakes.
He must want something in Keystone.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.967
- Tracy Brand's lab.
- He's going after Fallout.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.515
All right, call Tracy, tell her
we're coming for Borman, okay?

08:00.605 --> 08:02.562
Wait, and gonna do what?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.315
Just to take him somewhere else.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.482
We can't take him here.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.359
We can't even contain his fallout.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.562
Tracy's barely been able to contain
his powers as is.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.989
Yeah, the guy is a nuclear explosion
waiting to go off,

08:12.075 --> 08:13.691
and I don't know about you,
but I have had

08:13.785 --> 08:15.242
my fill of nuclear bombs this year.

08:15.412 --> 08:18.371
But if we can cool him down,
we can get him somewhere safe.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.697
What about Snart's cold gun?

08:19.791 --> 08:22.204
I mean, I have a prototype,
but to modify it to our needs,

08:22.293 --> 08:24.159
- that would take at least a day.
- We don't have that kinda time.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.370
DeVoe is coming for him.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.830
DeVoe has known our every move.
I mean, we've gotta do something

08:27.924 --> 08:29.005
that he hasn't accounted for.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.630
How are we supposed to find
a way to cool down Borman,

08:31.720 --> 08:33.712
and take him somewhere
DeVoe won't know about,

08:33.804 --> 08:36.969
with a plan he won't see coming?

08:37.058 --> 08:40.426
Call Lyla. See if A.R.G.U.S.
has anything off the grid.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.432
Okay, but even if they do,
I mean, what are we gonna do

08:42.522 --> 08:44.229
about the other two problems?

08:52.782 --> 08:57.948
War's over. Bad guys and girls lost.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.747
Nazi regime's been dismantled.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.245
And the rebellion's in charge now.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.464
Why don't you turn yourself in?

09:10.884 --> 09:13.217
Save us the Tom and Jerry.

09:14.929 --> 09:19.424
Find some other misguided cause
to get all agro about.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.688
Not this night.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.562
I will fight until
every last one of you

09:28.651 --> 09:31.985
finds the same fate
as my brothers and sisters.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.066
Your timing is impeccable.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.861
Your timing is impeccable.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.620
We need your help on our Earth.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.493
Right now, I'm kinda busy.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.074
Doing what? Dying?

09:47.337 --> 09:48.453
TouchÃ©.

10:06.689 --> 10:10.478
So, you're trying to stop a guy who
thinks he's smarter than everyone,

10:10.568 --> 10:12.275
and his true believer lover,

10:12.362 --> 10:16.697
who are hell-bent in achieving
their evil machinations at any cost?

10:17.408 --> 10:18.865
Well, it's right up my alley.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.490
Except DeVoe actually is
smarter than everyone, Leo.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.659
He created 12 meta-humans
just so he could steal their powers.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.490
And he left everybody dead
in the process.

10:26.584 --> 10:30.123
Including Ralph Dibny,
who was a team member of ours.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.167
I'm sorry. That's rough.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.670
All these deaths have been rough.
We can't dwell on them right now.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.877
We have to focus, so that
DeVoe doesn't know what we're doing,

10:37.971 --> 10:39.178
and we have a shot at saving Borman.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.346
Which is why we came to you.

10:41.516 --> 10:44.054
I see.
I'm just outside the box enough,

10:44.227 --> 10:45.684
to catch DeVoe off-guard.

10:45.937 --> 10:50.022
That, and we need your cold gun.

10:50.775 --> 10:51.856
Oh? For what?

10:52.152 --> 10:55.020
We've been working on modifying
a radiation hazmat suit

10:55.113 --> 10:56.604
to regulate his internal temperature

10:56.698 --> 11:00.738
to keep his core from raising to the
point of detonation during transport.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.739
Your cold gun would be our backup.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.537
It must be happy hour.
And I'm the two-for-one.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.206
What about your chilly friend?
She doesn't want in on the fun?

11:08.626 --> 11:11.084
- She's gone.
- That's too bad.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.296
All right. You get me for 24 hours,
not a minute more.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.543
Wait, why not?

11:16.342 --> 11:20.382
Because I thought I'd make
Ray an honest man tomorrow.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.804
You're getting married?
That's so exciting.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.508
I figured if you two could make it,
so could we.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.763
- What?
- No, we...

11:26.853 --> 11:29.937
I tease.
So, where are we moving this guy to?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.390
A.R.G.U.S. has a facility
in New Brighton,

11:32.483 --> 11:35.601
high tech, high security.
He should be safe there.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.228
And how long till you're
done with the suit?

11:37.322 --> 11:38.358
Few more tweaks.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.440
Okay, I'm gonna call my dad
and let him know the plan.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.369
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.988
- Is that it? Are you done?
- Yeah.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.915
Well, the truth is,
the first one was the hard part.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.788
This one is simply, basically,
following the plan...

11:51.878 --> 11:54.541
Precisely. Let's take this
for a spin, shall we?

11:54.797 --> 11:56.538
All right. Okay.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.250
Here. Have a seat.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.469
Okay. All right then, I guess...

12:06.643 --> 12:09.477
Hey, I trust you.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.854
Yeah, well, I know that.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.560
Okay, here we go.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.394
Connection established.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.731
- It tingles.
- Yeah.

12:21.824 --> 12:24.988
Kinda feels like my conditioner. Ooh!

12:25.078 --> 12:27.411
That's your
synaptic activity enhancing.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.617
Whoa!

12:29.832 --> 12:32.666
Boy, is it ever.
It's like a party in my brain.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.039
I can see why you like this thing
so much.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.046
I can feel my neurons firing. Okay.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.707
Whoo-hoo!

12:40.176 --> 12:42.213
Pikachu! Whoo!

12:42.470 --> 12:46.430
- Harry! Harry!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.428
Hoo!

12:48.518 --> 12:52.728
Yeah, I think what happened was
probably a hyper limiter valve that...

12:52.897 --> 12:54.763
- Promethium ion diodes.
- Ion diodes.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.938
You overloaded the cap?

12:56.025 --> 12:59.268
We overloaded it. Real bummer.
Oh, well, we tried.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.024
How the hell did you get
promethium ion diodes?

13:01.281 --> 13:04.024
I got 'em. I... In my lab.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.944
On my Earth, I had them there,
but I'm all out unfortunately.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.738
We don't have any here. It would
take us weeks to get some.

13:11.708 --> 13:15.748
Oh, well, well, you know what,
we'll put in a back order,

13:15.837 --> 13:17.954
and we'll see if I can come up
with something else.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.208
Right.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.715
I see our scare tactics worked.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.886
They are going to move the asset
as you anticipated.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.761
Yes, but unfortunately,
not to the location I predicted.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.027
What is this?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.694
Your favorite dress.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.289
And you chose to wear that now?

13:54.876 --> 13:56.708
To please you, my love.

13:58.004 --> 14:01.247
Now, what would please me
is your understanding

14:01.341 --> 14:04.300
of the gravity of our undertaking.

14:04.552 --> 14:08.466
To right the misguided course
of all humanity.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.388
I just thought...

14:10.892 --> 14:14.727
You see, again you thought,

14:16.773 --> 14:19.857
which led you to this trivial notion.

14:20.568 --> 14:24.437
And now, go and change into something
a bit more appropriate.

14:24.989 --> 14:29.404
Your role from now,
until the enlightenment has occurred,

14:29.660 --> 14:33.074
is as my technician.

14:35.625 --> 14:40.541
Now leave me be, so that I can figure
out a way to motivate Team Flash

14:40.630 --> 14:45.170
to deliver our quarry to where
initially intended.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.344
<i>All right, look,
I think we take Highway 14.</i>

14:53.601 --> 14:56.309
It's as rural as we're gonna get. And
it's a straight shot to New Brighton.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.596
Best chance to get Fallout to safety.

14:58.689 --> 15:02.148
Sounds like a plan, Barry.
You know how I feel about plans.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.266
Yeah.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.312
This was your team member, right?
Ralph Dibny.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.406
Yeah. Elongated Man.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.822
Elongated Man.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.904
I don't remember someone with that
name being part of the fight

15:14.997 --> 15:19.742
- against the Nazis.
- No, no. He wasn't ready yet.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.502
A rookie hero.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.878
- So, you trained him?
- As much as I could. Yeah.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.969
Even harder death to take,
someone you've mentored.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.305
And yet, somehow, you seem okay.

15:33.391 --> 15:36.429
Considering this happened, what,
just a few days ago.

15:36.644 --> 15:40.479
I am okay. I'm just trying
to do what I have to do.

15:40.565 --> 15:45.185
- I'm trying to stay on task.
- Oh, is that what you're doing?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.691
You know how may rebels
we lost over the years, Barry,

15:47.780 --> 15:51.490
trying to defeat those Nazi bastards?

15:51.576 --> 15:53.693
- Countless, I'm sure.
- Not countless.

15:53.995 --> 15:57.864
Counted. 18,322,

15:57.957 --> 16:01.246
3,679 were under my watch.

16:01.335 --> 16:05.045
And I felt the weight of each
of their deaths, I still do,

16:05.214 --> 16:07.547
so many years after they died.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.881
Leo, look...

16:08.968 --> 16:12.006
The thing I realized is that
to continue to lead,

16:12.096 --> 16:15.806
to be clear-headed, I had to
grieve those men and women I lost.

16:15.892 --> 16:19.101
So, I did. Each and every one.

16:21.981 --> 16:26.396
Look, Barry, you want me to help
you move a meta-human nuclear bomb

16:26.486 --> 16:30.355
that some genius with nearly every
meta power on this board is after,

16:30.448 --> 16:31.655
I will do what I can.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.948
As long as your head is on straight,

16:34.035 --> 16:38.154
because if I die before Ray and I
get married, Ray will kill me.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.161
Suit's ready.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.334
And Fallout is ready at Tracy's lab.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.125
So, let's get to Keystone. You good?

16:47.632 --> 16:50.170
- I'm good.
- Then let's go get our guy.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.306
<i>Meta-human nuclear bomb.
Meta-human nuclear bomb.</i>

16:57.725 --> 16:59.182
<i>And Fallout is ready at Tracy's lab.</i>

16:59.268 --> 17:00.759
<i>And Fallout is ready at Tracy's lab.</i>

17:00.853 --> 17:02.264
<i>Let's get to Keystone.</i>

17:02.355 --> 17:04.768
<i>Let's get to Keystone.
Let's get to Keystone.</i>

17:04.857 --> 17:06.098
<i>Then let's go get our guy.</i>

17:06.192 --> 17:07.603
<i>Then let's go get our guy.</i>

17:08.152 --> 17:10.189
Yes, let's.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.771
After all,
a nuke is a terrible thing to waste.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.871
You're telling me I have to wear
this thing the whole time?

17:20.957 --> 17:23.290
Yeah. Look,
that suit protects us from you,

17:23.376 --> 17:25.038
so that
we can protect you from the guy

17:25.127 --> 17:26.117
that's trying to hunt you down.

17:26.671 --> 17:27.787
But why is he after me?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.748
Honestly, Neil, we don't know. But
we wanna find out as much as you do.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.924
And we will, trust me.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.754
You saved me once, Flash,
I trust you to do it again.

17:38.099 --> 17:39.135
What's that?

17:39.225 --> 17:43.310
I whipped up this cocktail of
atomized DTPI and potassium iodide.

17:43.479 --> 17:47.018
It should flood our thyroids
with enough non-radioactive iodine,

17:47.108 --> 17:49.020
so that
if our containment suit doesn't work,

17:49.277 --> 17:52.236
it should offer some protection
from radiation.

17:52.655 --> 17:56.524
Some protection?
How vaguely reassuring.

17:57.827 --> 18:00.535
- How long will this last?
- Two, three hours max.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.116
Then you better get going.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.706
All right, let's just go over
the plan one more time, okay.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.875
I'm gonna be running ahead
of the truck, scouting the route

18:06.961 --> 18:08.122
- for any signs of trouble.
- Right.

18:08.212 --> 18:11.046
I will be at S.T.A.R. Labs, tracking
any pocket dimension en route.

18:11.215 --> 18:14.379
And I will be in the truck with Neil,
monitoring his vitals and rads.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.795
With me at the ready in case our
meta of mass destruction here

18:17.888 --> 18:20.130
goes all mushroom cloud. No offense.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.849
And I'll be driving
and reciting every prayer

18:22.935 --> 18:24.426
that Cecile's ever taught me.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.182
I might join you.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.476
Look, guys, I know
DeVoe has hit us pretty hard,

18:28.566 --> 18:31.684
but right now, let's just try to
forget what he's taken from us

18:31.861 --> 18:33.693
and stay focused on
taking something from him,

18:33.779 --> 18:35.987
by getting Neil safely to A.R.G.U.S.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.406
We do that, whatever DeVoe
has planned falls apart.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.158
Winning this battle
may just win us the war.

18:40.369 --> 18:44.579
Hear, hear. Let's all make sure
we keep our heads in the game.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.332
So, we can stay safe out there.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.631
- I know what that was about.
- It was a good speech, Barry.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.759
Just making sure you heard it,
didn't just give it.

18:57.845 --> 18:58.961
What is that supposed to mean?

18:59.055 --> 19:03.390
If you don't confront your feelings,
they will confront you.

19:09.565 --> 19:10.772
All clear on my end.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.017
There's no pocket dimension
activity in the area.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.439
<i>Roads are looking good, too. Joe?</i>

19:15.655 --> 19:16.771
Yeah, the rig is secure.

19:18.824 --> 19:22.238
<i>- Caitlin?</i>
- Rads are good. Heartbeat regular.

19:28.626 --> 19:31.118
On Earth-X, we have a saying,
"If you laugh out loud,

19:31.253 --> 19:32.994
"you gotta share the joke."

19:33.089 --> 19:38.050
By-product of living on an Earth
where joy is a scarce commodity.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.927
It's a Post-it note
from Killer Frost.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.761
It's how we talk or talked.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.593
"Broke the thermostat again.
I think it hates me."

19:47.770 --> 19:51.059
Aw! That's cute. Do you miss her?

19:51.148 --> 19:54.607
It's not that. It's just that

19:54.694 --> 19:57.482
we were starting
to become close lately.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.697
And I know how crazy that sounds,

20:00.783 --> 20:02.069
considering, we're talking
about someone

20:02.159 --> 20:03.525
who actually lived inside of me.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.079
I'm on an alt-Earth,
transporting a human bomb.

20:07.164 --> 20:10.157
With an escort that can literally
run back to the future.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.285
Your story is the least crazy thing
I've heard all day.

20:13.921 --> 20:17.255
One thing's for sure.
I will miss those little notes.

20:17.633 --> 20:22.549
Alter-ego or not,
it's okay to miss someone we've lost.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.554
How's he doing?

20:24.890 --> 20:27.052
Good. His rads are low,
vitals seem stable.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.388
I gave him a sedative,
and it seems to be working.

20:29.603 --> 20:30.684
Okay, good. We're almost there.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.137
Guys, there's
pocket dimension activity.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.735
Dad?

20:46.829 --> 20:47.990
We're trapped in here.

20:48.289 --> 20:53.205
The doors are unlocked,
but it's just like it weighs a ton.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.751
- Iris?
- Iris?

20:55.045 --> 20:57.253
- Dad?
- The comms are out. It's DeVoe.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.881
He's here?

21:12.271 --> 21:13.933
Mr. Allen,

21:14.315 --> 21:16.523
as usual, you're a step behind me.

21:16.817 --> 21:21.608
Yay, puns. You Earth-1 villains
sure are a hoot.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.023
You have no idea, Mr. Snart.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.902
You're not taking Fallout.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.196
I can, and I will.

21:27.286 --> 21:32.327
If not here and now, then after your
top secret transfer to A.R.G.U.S.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.449
Yes, I know.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.827
Remember?

21:36.921 --> 21:40.130
Good. I won't have to feel guilty
about doing this.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.852
Well, that deescalated quickly.

21:54.939 --> 21:58.523
The minuscule soundwaves produced
by that toy trinket of yours

21:58.609 --> 22:02.728
are far too weak
for this new body of mine.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.860
What a gift Mr. Dibny provided.

22:06.283 --> 22:10.493
Well, it was a gift in
a manner of speaking. Right, rookie?

22:19.296 --> 22:20.537
Barry.

22:20.631 --> 22:23.499
Why such turmoil in your mind,
Mr. Allen?

22:24.969 --> 22:26.926
Allow me to ease your pain.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.436
That's it. I'm leaving.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.234
No, I need you to stay here,
and calm down!

22:43.320 --> 22:45.186
Neil, wait!

22:46.782 --> 22:48.739
I want you all to listen to me
very carefully,

22:48.826 --> 22:51.034
and hopefully,
I won't have to raise my voice.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.037
This truck is now mine.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.415
We really have no way of finding
Joe and Caitlin,

23:01.630 --> 23:03.041
not even by tracking Fallout.

23:03.132 --> 23:05.920
That hazmat suit is hiding
his radiation signature.

23:06.010 --> 23:09.094
So, the satellite can't even
find him, unless he heats up.

23:09.471 --> 23:12.134
Okay, what do you know
about Laurel Lance's doppelganger?

23:12.266 --> 23:13.507
Why was she hunting you?

23:13.767 --> 23:16.635
That was Siren-X.
All that's left of the Reichsman.

23:17.104 --> 23:21.064
An elite assassin gone mad,
and she is relentless.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.938
Carried the torch for Dark Arrow.
Unrequited.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.819
So, she is none too pleased
with those responsible for his death,

23:27.698 --> 23:29.439
present company included.

23:29.617 --> 23:31.984
So, she has the same powers
as Black Siren?

23:33.037 --> 23:35.154
The Laurel Lance of Earth-2.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.990
- And Earth-1's Laurel Lance?
- She died.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.909
She was the second Black Canary
after her sister.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.999
Who also died and came back,
but as White Canary 'cause...

23:44.214 --> 23:45.625
- Cisco.
- It's complicated.

23:45.799 --> 23:51.011
Right. Doppelganger confusion aside,
Siren-X has my cold gun and a nuke.

23:51.180 --> 23:54.093
And her thirst for vengeance won't
prevent her from using either one

23:54.183 --> 23:57.096
on me, or all of you now.

23:59.396 --> 24:02.389
- Hey. Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.395
I'm just a little worried.
It seemed like

24:04.485 --> 24:05.475
she got the jump on you out there.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.310
She didn't.
She just caught me off-guard.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.440
But why does it matter right now?

24:08.530 --> 24:10.066
We don't even know
where Joe and Caitlin are?

24:10.157 --> 24:13.491
Hey, Cisco, will you just see
if Harry has any ideas?

24:13.619 --> 24:14.951
- I'm on it.
- Just watch the satellites,

24:15.037 --> 24:16.153
like a hawk.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.577
Leo, what exactly happened out there?

24:20.668 --> 24:22.876
Well, just your typical deadly combat

24:22.962 --> 24:25.625
between two metas
from multiple Earths.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.205
Leonard.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.709
- I'll go talk to him.
- Thank you.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.795
Where is it?

24:33.889 --> 24:35.881
Hey, Ramon, what are you doing?

24:36.058 --> 24:38.721
A Nazi Laurel Lance
just kidnapped Caitlin and Joe.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.474
We're gonna make this thing work,
and we're gonna make it work now.

24:41.563 --> 24:42.644
Well, we can't.

24:42.731 --> 24:46.566
We can't. I still haven't found
a replacement for that...

24:46.652 --> 24:49.019
- Where did you get that?
- I found this

24:49.113 --> 24:50.695
in one of the cubes Gypsy sent me.

24:50.781 --> 24:53.194
How clever of you. You know what,
Ramon, it's still not gonna work.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.399
- It's not gonna work.
- Why?

24:54.493 --> 24:56.405
Because it's not gonna work, okay?
Because it's a waste of time.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.861
Because I said so, that's why!

24:57.955 --> 24:59.617
- Well, in that case...
- Listen, Ramon.

24:59.707 --> 25:02.120
- Our friends' lives are at stake.
- You don't...

25:02.209 --> 25:03.825
Look, I don't know
what's going on with you,

25:03.919 --> 25:05.911
but if you're not gonna help me
with this thing, I...

25:06.213 --> 25:07.670
What...

25:10.175 --> 25:11.791
Why would you do that?

25:13.470 --> 25:15.302
To protect you.

25:18.308 --> 25:19.924
The cap did this?

25:22.021 --> 25:23.137
And dark matter.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.185
You used dark matter.

25:27.484 --> 25:30.022
I used dark matter.
Look, Ramon, it was the only way.

25:30.112 --> 25:33.105
The only way to do what,
fry your synapses?

25:33.490 --> 25:35.573
Harry, you promised me.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.322
I know I promised you.
I promised you.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.574
Oh, my God.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.951
Harry, how could you be so stupid?

25:43.167 --> 25:44.624
'Cause I felt so stupid.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.167
We all feel stupid right now!

25:46.253 --> 25:49.462
Yes! But you're Vibe,
Allen's the Flash, who am I?

25:50.090 --> 25:54.209
My only job is to be smarter

25:54.303 --> 25:56.169
than all the villains
who wanna hurt this team,

25:56.263 --> 25:57.799
and without that, I'm nothing.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.725
I'm about to lose the only part of me
that is any value to this team,

26:02.811 --> 26:06.976
the only part of me that matters,
and so, yeah, I destroyed the cap.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.808
So that you wouldn't make the same
mistake I did.

26:14.615 --> 26:19.827
- This should not be happening.
- Perhaps, you miscalculated.

26:20.954 --> 26:23.412
I calculated everything.

26:23.499 --> 26:26.207
The Flash's involvement
with the bus-meta.

26:26.293 --> 26:29.127
The little recruitment
of Snart's doppelganger.

26:29.338 --> 26:32.126
Even the arrival
of the Earth-X banshee.

26:32.424 --> 26:37.215
Every event occurred exactly
as I predicted,

26:37.304 --> 26:38.590
except the outcome!

26:39.139 --> 26:41.301
You were supposed to defeat Siren-X?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.307
No.

26:43.393 --> 26:48.809
The Flash was, but
Barry Allen just stood there, frozen.

26:49.274 --> 26:52.312
And now,
I've lost my only nuclear meta.

26:52.402 --> 26:54.189
Because the Flash failed!

26:54.279 --> 26:58.364
Why? Why did he fail?

26:58.450 --> 27:01.943
Perhaps, there were variables
that we just did not consider.

27:02.037 --> 27:05.747
As I already explained,
there is no variable

27:05.916 --> 27:08.158
beyond my examination.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.785
Even less apparent.

27:11.088 --> 27:13.045
The last time Barry Allen saw you,

27:13.132 --> 27:15.089
you took the life
of his close friend.

27:15.175 --> 27:19.010
And now, he sees you and he pauses.
You really don't see it.

27:19.263 --> 27:22.847
You can calculate near infinite
outcomes across multiple Earths,

27:22.933 --> 27:27.553
but you cannot account
for how someone is feeling.

27:41.535 --> 27:43.697
What did you see out there, Barry?

27:44.037 --> 27:46.950
- When you froze up?
- Nothing.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.039
You just got
two of your teammates captured,

27:49.126 --> 27:51.288
and almost got me killed,

27:51.378 --> 27:56.123
so, either you explain what happened,
or I leave.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.378
- I saw Ralph.
- I warned you.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.050
He's messing with your head.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.971
No, it's not like that.
Do I miss him? Yes.

28:03.140 --> 28:06.759
Do I regret what happened? Of course.
But I don't need lessons in loss.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.972
What I need to do right now,
is lead my team.

28:09.062 --> 28:11.725
You're gonna lead them to their
deaths if you don't deal with this.

28:11.815 --> 28:14.353
- Back off, Leo.
- You need to grieve him, Barry.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.059
Grief is a luxury
I don't have time for.

28:16.153 --> 28:19.317
- Make time!
- I can't!

28:19.406 --> 28:23.696
Not Ralph. Not right now.

28:24.328 --> 28:25.318
Ah.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.367
So, we've finally reached the core.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.705
You don't want to grieve this one.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.963
So, Ralph's death must be different

28:37.049 --> 28:40.008
from all the other losses
you've experienced, but why?

28:40.302 --> 28:42.259
Why?

28:42.346 --> 28:47.057
Barry, trust me,
there is no outrunning grief.

28:48.810 --> 28:50.972
That was a pun, I'm sorry.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.031
Run! Run!

29:09.248 --> 29:11.706
CCPD.

29:11.875 --> 29:15.243
Home of the brave, land of the dead.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.341
Killing all these people
won't bring back your regime.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.966
No, it won't. But decimating
your so-called officers,

29:26.056 --> 29:27.422
will make it
a hell of a lot more even.

29:28.058 --> 29:29.549
I'll make sure of it.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.176
- Remove your helmet.
- What?

29:32.813 --> 29:34.145
Take it off!

29:46.493 --> 29:48.860
CCPD. Why would she take him there?

29:48.954 --> 29:50.365
We destroyed her Earth's protectors,

29:50.455 --> 29:51.696
maybe she wants
to do the same thing to us.

29:51.999 --> 29:53.706
- Harry, we need eyes.
- You know what?

29:54.084 --> 29:55.700
Why don't you let me
take care of it, all right?

29:55.794 --> 29:57.251
You keep an eye on the rads.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.873
Leo, we're on.

29:59.089 --> 30:01.001
Barry, I'm always on.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.665
- But wait, I need a...
- Got you.

30:04.094 --> 30:05.460
- Thank you, Iris.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:09.725 --> 30:12.092
How much time do we have left
on the injection?

30:12.185 --> 30:13.175
Not enough.

30:31.455 --> 30:35.324
- Barry!
- This is for destroying my world!

30:39.338 --> 30:41.751
- 7,000 rads.
- And climbing.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.130
Guys, you gotta cool him down.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.933
8,000 rads and climbing.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.774
Flash! Get up! Get up!

31:06.990 --> 31:08.231
Flash.

31:08.325 --> 31:10.066
People are going to die, Flash!

31:10.410 --> 31:12.367
- I'm not ready to die.
- Rise up.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.654
<i>- Let me train you.</i>
- Train me?

31:15.165 --> 31:17.452
Fight it, all right. Fight it!
I'll save you!

31:17.626 --> 31:18.662
Flash.

31:18.752 --> 31:22.086
Flash, you have to deal
with the pain.

31:23.173 --> 31:24.289
No!

31:24.883 --> 31:27.626
You can't get away from
what's inside you, so, stop trying!

31:29.179 --> 31:30.795
Flash!

31:32.140 --> 31:35.383
9,000 rads.
The whole place is gonna blow.

31:35.685 --> 31:38.553
Flash! It wasn't your fault!

31:38.647 --> 31:39.683
<i>Ralph!</i>

31:39.773 --> 31:40.854
I'll save you.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.107
You already did, Barry.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.121
<i>He's burning up.</i>

32:04.256 --> 32:06.043
Time to get cold-blooded.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.469
8,000 rads.

32:17.227 --> 32:18.559
7,000 rads.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.436
<i>Keep icing him, it's working.</i>

32:24.359 --> 32:25.440
And dropping.

32:33.535 --> 32:36.573
<i>- He's contained.
- They did it.</i>

32:44.087 --> 32:45.203
Where's the Flash?

32:53.138 --> 32:55.505
Barr. What's going on, Barr?

32:57.684 --> 33:01.519
He trusted me, Joe.
And I let him down.

33:02.606 --> 33:05.474
Ralph, I'm the reason he's dead.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.608
- No.
- No.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.728
- No.
- I failed him.

33:10.155 --> 33:14.399
He was my responsibility.
Now, he's gone.

33:15.285 --> 33:16.321
It's all right.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.787
So, we're sure
that Fallout is secure?

33:28.173 --> 33:30.711
Well, Lyla said she had some people
who would be very interested

33:30.800 --> 33:32.541
in helping Borman control his power.

33:32.636 --> 33:33.922
She took him
to a different A.R.G.U.S.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.174
- black-op site way off the grid.
- How far off the grid?

33:36.598 --> 33:40.091
Like, it would take Jack Ryan
two Tom Clancy novels to find him.

33:40.352 --> 33:45.518
I gotta say, on any Earth,
Snarts have style. Perfect fit.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.098
I thought
you could do something with it.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.979
- You wear it well.
- Thank you.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.901
You sure
you can't come to the wedding?

33:50.987 --> 33:52.944
I could put all of you
at a table with Ray's uncle, Skip,

33:53.114 --> 33:54.855
he murders the Macarena.

33:55.408 --> 33:58.071
- Yeah, DeVoe is still out there.
- Suit yourselves.

33:58.328 --> 34:00.570
But if you are looking
for a place to honeymoon,

34:00.747 --> 34:03.239
our Earth
has some pretty spectacular spots.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.323
What is this?

34:04.417 --> 34:06.830
That is an interdimensional
extrapolator.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.286
It makes small-scale breaches.

34:08.797 --> 34:12.165
In case, Ray's uncle, Skip, wants
to see how the other half lives.

34:12.801 --> 34:15.635
Look at that. "Something old,
something new, something borrowed."

34:16.096 --> 34:17.212
Something navy.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.346
We're gonna miss you, Leo.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.514
I'm gonna miss you too, Caitlin.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.760
You're quite the badass, you know.

34:23.978 --> 34:27.143
- Enough to make your alter ego proud.
- Thank you.

34:27.607 --> 34:30.145
Detective West,
I know my Earth-1 counterpart

34:30.235 --> 34:31.351
gave you a lot of headaches.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.561
Hopefully, I've begun
to make up for that.

34:33.780 --> 34:38.024
Man, you prevented a nuke
from leveling the city.

34:39.034 --> 34:40.867
We're good.

34:40.954 --> 34:43.617
Cisco, I think
I'm gonna miss that hair.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.286
Okay.

34:47.377 --> 34:48.663
Iris West-Allen,

34:49.004 --> 34:52.623
thank you for helping me take down
Nazi scum again.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.632
You're welcome again.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.678
And then there was one.

35:00.974 --> 35:03.591
I could see why the other Snart
turned over a new leaf

35:03.685 --> 35:05.642
and joined the good guys.

35:06.062 --> 35:09.146
You treat everyone around you
with kindness and respect.

35:10.609 --> 35:15.229
Just remember to do the same
for yourself, every once in a while.

35:15.488 --> 35:20.028
- Thanks for helping me push through.
- Anytime, Barry.

35:21.411 --> 35:22.527
Don't be a stranger.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.789
Oh, you never know.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.674
How you doing?
I know last night was pretty rough.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.756
I'll tell you about it
when we see Dr. Finkel.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.466
We're seeing, Dr. Finkel?

35:45.852 --> 35:48.765
Yeah, I gave her a call.

35:57.906 --> 35:59.522
How's it going?

36:00.533 --> 36:01.569
I don't know.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.073
Hauling a nuclear meta
across the state,

36:04.245 --> 36:06.453
getting kidnapped
by a screeching psychopath,

36:06.539 --> 36:09.532
and helping save this city,
I'd say that's pretty impressive

36:09.626 --> 36:11.709
for someone without a meta other half
to lean on.

36:12.128 --> 36:16.168
Thanks. You know,
the thing I realized yesterday is,

36:16.257 --> 36:18.795
even though
I can live without Killer Frost,

36:19.052 --> 36:20.338
I don't think I want to.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.294
Run some more tests,
find out for sure.

36:22.389 --> 36:23.630
I already did.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.174
- And?
- I'm too afraid to find out.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.183
Let's find out together.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.138
What does it say?

36:34.901 --> 36:37.735
It says the reason dark matter
isn't registering in my body,

36:37.821 --> 36:39.733
is because there is none.

36:39.823 --> 36:42.065
So, she's gone?

36:42.742 --> 36:46.076
It says there's still another
cryogenic anomaly in my DNA.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.241
Killer Frost is still a part of you.

36:48.665 --> 36:51.408
I just have to figure out
how to get her to appear.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.041
You going somewhere?

37:01.845 --> 37:05.839
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I'm gonna
visit my daughter while I'm still...

37:06.015 --> 37:08.849
Of sound mind. It's not like I can
help you guys around here, anyway.

37:08.935 --> 37:11.427
'Cause that is the only part
of you that matters,

37:11.521 --> 37:13.854
- that mind of yours.
- Exactly.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.895
Is that why
Jesse turned out so great?

37:17.110 --> 37:19.773
Yeah. No. I don't know.
What's your point?

37:21.322 --> 37:24.315
- Jesse Quick, superhero, scientist.
- Yeah, I know who she is.

37:24.409 --> 37:28.119
All-around wonderful person.
She turned out that way because...

37:29.080 --> 37:32.164
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

37:32.751 --> 37:36.040
You told me you were about to lose
the only part of you that has value.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.669
Yeah. Yeah.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.043
Raising Jesse?

37:40.133 --> 37:43.251
Raising a kid
that turns out like that.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.630
That takes a lot more
than intelligence.

37:46.723 --> 37:49.136
If you asked her, I'm pretty
sure she'd tell you, learning

37:49.392 --> 37:52.806
quadratic equations at age five
from her math-obsessed father

37:52.896 --> 37:55.263
wasn't nearly as important to her
as having a dad,

37:55.523 --> 37:58.186
who was there for her,
and who gave a damn.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.986
- So, my point is...
- Well taken.

38:05.158 --> 38:06.365
So, now what?

38:07.035 --> 38:09.152
Slow down, wait till I regress
to a simpleton?

38:09.537 --> 38:11.119
Now, we figure out a way to fix you.

38:11.206 --> 38:12.788
Just like you did
when Barry lost his speed,

38:12.999 --> 38:16.618
we find a way to
jump-start your brain.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.916
But this is the hard part 'cause
it's gonna take all of us to do it.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.665
Which means
you have to tell the team.

38:23.635 --> 38:27.219
I gotta tell the team.

38:27.722 --> 38:30.135
Yeah. I know you're right,

38:31.726 --> 38:33.513
but maybe not today.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.516
When you're ready.

38:44.447 --> 38:47.440
- Ramon.
- Yeah?

38:48.243 --> 38:50.951
Thank you.

38:58.294 --> 39:03.881
I knew Ralph since
I was a rookie on the force.

39:04.133 --> 39:07.877
And all that time,
I thought I knew exactly

39:07.971 --> 39:09.758
what kind of person he was.

39:09.973 --> 39:11.259
Why is that?

39:11.808 --> 39:14.516
We just never saw things
the same way.

39:14.602 --> 39:19.973
You know, I was raised
to believe that people are good.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.352
And Ralph?

39:21.818 --> 39:25.027
He always saw the worst in people.

39:25.238 --> 39:27.696
And he knew
how to take advantage of it.

39:28.116 --> 39:31.029
But, um, he changed.

39:34.080 --> 39:37.448
Yeah, he did. He changed,

39:37.542 --> 39:42.583
and I couldn't see that
for a long time.

39:42.672 --> 39:47.337
And now, that I can, I...
I think that's what's so hard, is...

39:47.552 --> 39:50.044
You know, of course I miss Ralph,

39:50.138 --> 39:54.428
but it just took me so long to see
what he had become.

39:54.601 --> 39:57.969
I just,
I never had a chance to tell him

39:58.062 --> 40:02.432
just how proud I am
to be his friend.

40:02.650 --> 40:06.610
And I always will be.

40:06.696 --> 40:10.315
- I'm sure he knew that, Barry.
- Yeah.

40:10.408 --> 40:14.118
What else would you tell him
if you could right now?

40:17.040 --> 40:19.874
That I feel responsible.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.372
I feel responsible for what happened.

40:27.383 --> 40:31.502
And he taught me more than
I could have ever taught him.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.634
And for that,
I'll always be grateful.

41:04.420 --> 41:08.084
Allowing events to unfold naturally
turned out in our favor.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.340
Just as you said it would.

41:10.760 --> 41:14.595
And success came our way
without the hindrance of that most

41:14.681 --> 41:18.641
aberrant of human follies,

41:18.726 --> 41:21.969
- emotion.
- It did, indeed.

41:22.188 --> 41:26.432
To think for a moment there
I experienced doubt.

41:26.776 --> 41:30.690
So, perhaps now, you can accept
that the primitive, cognitive

41:30.780 --> 41:33.989
entanglements that
derailed Mr. Allen today,

41:34.492 --> 41:39.283
can only serve to hold us back
from completing our work.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.996
Yes.

41:43.459 --> 41:44.449
I see that, now.

41:49.132 --> 41:51.749
More clear than ever before.
