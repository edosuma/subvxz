<i>So I'm embarrassed about this,
but I have this giant astrology book.</i>

00:54.721 --> 00:59.215
<i>And it says that today,
that my 29th birthday...</i>

00:59.392 --> 01:05.126
<i>...Saturn returns to the place of my birth
and it turns my life upside-down.</i>

01:07.467 --> 01:12.302
<i>It says that Saturn is going to bring
all of my shit to the surface...</i>

01:12.472 --> 01:15.168
<i>...and then I'm going to evolve.</i>

01:15.341 --> 01:17.935
<i>I'm paraphrasing, of course.</i>

01:18.545 --> 01:22.003
<i>I know that change is inevitable.</i>

01:22.182 --> 01:25.777
<i>But what if I don't want things to change?</i>

01:25.952 --> 01:29.683
<i>What if I like my life exactly how it is?</i>

01:51.744 --> 01:54.110
Happy birthday.

01:54.547 --> 01:56.378
I feel old.

01:56.549 --> 01:58.983
You're so old.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.615
Do I look 29?

02:04.791 --> 02:06.986
Yeah, you kind of do.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.156
No, I'm only kidding.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.194
You look like the white J. Lo.

02:11.364 --> 02:14.026
Baby, J. Lo is in her 40s.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.294
- No, she's not.
- Yes, she is.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.563
- J. Lo's in her 40s?
- Mm-hm.

02:20.773 --> 02:22.070
What?

02:24.110 --> 02:26.271
I got a surprise.

02:26.779 --> 02:28.178
Blow.

02:29.082 --> 02:32.142
- Now you're gonna get it.
- I can't get it. Heh-heh.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.684
Now you're gonna get it.

02:36.956 --> 02:38.651
You're gonna get it.

02:38.825 --> 02:42.317
Why aren't you ticklish? It's so weird.

02:43.129 --> 02:45.495
- All right, if...
- Okay, okay, I got it. I love you.

02:45.665 --> 02:49.032
- I love you too, Lola. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

02:50.236 --> 02:53.728
You look very handsome today!

02:54.274 --> 02:55.866
Don't anybody touch him!

02:56.042 --> 02:58.272
He's mine!

02:58.444 --> 03:01.971
Yes, you can die from
drinking too much water.

03:02.148 --> 03:03.376
Yes.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.848
I'll e-mail you the article.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.617
I know, you just have to find a balance. It's...

03:08.788 --> 03:11.382
- Oh, my...!
- Bike lane!

03:12.091 --> 03:14.753
No, Luke's great.

03:14.928 --> 03:19.024
Yeah, he's just been working like crazy
on his solo show.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.895
It's paintings of celebrity sex tapes.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.229
No, Anderson Cooper's not in there.

03:24.404 --> 03:25.530
Should he be?

03:40.653 --> 03:44.248
What...? Are you trying to masturbate?
We just had sex.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.921
- Lola.
- Yes?

03:56.436 --> 03:57.960
Will you marry me?

04:02.475 --> 04:06.002
Do you think there's a magazine
for pregnant brides?

04:06.813 --> 04:08.337
Have you died?!

04:08.514 --> 04:10.345
No, I'm ready.

04:12.385 --> 04:13.647
Dude, you look incredible.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.820
- Don't tell Luke you were here.
- Let me video-chat with him.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.891
What? You've had literally
the same phone since 11th grade.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.755
Whatever. Chicks love old phones.
They think I listen more.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.829
You trying to take maid of honor from me?

04:24.998 --> 04:27.762
<i>I ordered strippers who get naked
to the soundtrack of Glee.</i>

04:27.934 --> 04:30.494
- I'm not listening.
- Can your band play Cee Lo?

04:30.670 --> 04:33.298
- I'm a rock star.
- Ta-ta.

04:34.340 --> 04:37.332
It's a wedding dress! It's a wedding dress!

04:37.510 --> 04:39.808
No, no. Gluten-free chocolate.

04:39.979 --> 04:41.310
Ask about the icing.

04:41.481 --> 04:45.349
What...? Yeah, oh, Raimundo,
is the icing rice-milk based?

04:45.518 --> 04:47.042
- Non-GMO.
- No rice milk.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.381
Non... Non-GMO.

04:49.555 --> 04:52.183
No, wait... Hold on.
Hold on, Raimundo, yeah.

04:52.358 --> 04:55.521
I got someone on the other line. Hello?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.996
Oh, hi, hi.

04:59.165 --> 05:00.655
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.357
Yeah, it's your mom. Again.

05:02.535 --> 05:05.868
Could you please tell her that
we've been planning this for nine months?

05:06.039 --> 05:08.007
- We got it under control.
- Relax, honey.

05:08.174 --> 05:10.802
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Hi, Mom.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.811
I know, but it's too expensive
if the resort caters it.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.005
Okay, I have to go.

05:16.182 --> 05:18.650
- I love you too. Bye.
- Hey, Alice. Nice dress.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.286
- It's expensive.
- I'm gonna step outside for a minute.

05:21.454 --> 05:22.887
Okay. What's up?

05:23.056 --> 05:26.082
Well, I'm the last single woman
in New York City.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.523
I went to volunteer at
a womers homeless shelter.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.686
They all had boyfriends.

05:30.863 --> 05:32.262
The homeless.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.992
Why don't you date Henry? He's single.

05:35.168 --> 05:39.104
I don't know, Henry is sort of hot,
but he's your best friend.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.603
It would be like fucking you.

05:42.642 --> 05:44.940
I'm gonna find you a guy if it kills me.

05:46.212 --> 05:49.181
What's your Match. com log-in?
Is it still "Let-me-be-your-hole"?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.044
"Let-me-be-your-hole-1."

05:51.217 --> 05:53.879
It was taken. The first one was taken.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.647
All right, I'm following the dot,
and the dot...

05:56.823 --> 05:58.290
It's moving all over the place.

05:58.458 --> 05:59.755
- Where is it, Len?
- This way.

05:59.926 --> 06:03.384
Dad, it's on the corner, so you don't need
to use your iPhone to get there.

06:03.563 --> 06:06.691
Okay. Because the iPad,
wouldn't that get us there faster?

06:06.866 --> 06:08.731
- Yeah.
- You are obsessed with this thing.

06:08.901 --> 06:13.065
It's a sickness. Now he plays Scrabble
with strangers online in Milwaukee.

06:13.239 --> 06:15.230
I am retired. Let me soar.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.876
I know this building. Do you remember?

06:18.044 --> 06:20.274
It was a sex dungeon.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.277
Right. Let me search that.

06:22.882 --> 06:28.377
Honey, you're gonna die
when you see these flowers.

06:28.955 --> 06:32.948
I feel like I should just quit school
and start planning weddings.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.154
Honey, what's up? Did you have a stroke?

07:04.991 --> 07:06.583
Oh, no.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.695
What's happened here?

07:16.169 --> 07:19.400
It's comfier on the ground?

07:22.508 --> 07:24.476
You want me to get you something, honey?

07:27.280 --> 07:28.713
Chips.

07:49.535 --> 07:52.561
The issue is that 40 guests
have already bought their tickets...

07:52.738 --> 07:55.229
...for a destination wedding in Chiapas.

07:55.408 --> 07:58.741
Who's going to pay those people back?
Because it's not going to be Lola.

07:58.911 --> 08:03.848
Not when your heartless, shit-eating son decided
to pull the plug and ruin my daughter's life.

08:04.016 --> 08:07.383
Honey, drink the kombucha tea,
it settles the soul.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.214
Screw the kombucha.

08:09.388 --> 08:12.186
Let me buy you something
with high-fructose corn syrup.

08:12.358 --> 08:14.349
You want some nasty cinnamon buns?

08:14.527 --> 08:17.860
I could melt cinnamon buns
and feed them to you intravenously.

08:18.030 --> 08:21.124
No, no, I wonder, you know,
when you started to believe...

08:21.300 --> 08:24.463
...that the mother of the groom
should be involved...

08:24.637 --> 08:28.698
...because it certainly wasrt early on,
when we were making all the plans.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.703
- Thanks.
- Sure.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.109
You added a polar bear lamp.

08:39.284 --> 08:41.845
Yeah, I thrifted it.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.653
Okay, so, um, I...

08:45.825 --> 08:50.421
I know I said I kind of subletted
this apartment to you indefinitely...

08:50.596 --> 08:52.723
...but I'm gonna have
to move back because...

08:52.899 --> 08:56.630
It's okay. I know exactly where this is going
and it's actually perfect.

08:57.236 --> 09:00.034
Because my boyfriend just proposed!

09:00.206 --> 09:01.764
We're gonna move in together.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.576
Oh, my God.

09:13.786 --> 09:15.754
- He had such a beautiful loft.
- Yeah.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.117
- And it's rent-stabilized.
- I know.

09:18.925 --> 09:21.223
My world is shattered, and I'm eating.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.554
I'm power-eating.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.563
- You're eating rice chips.
- That have so much sodium.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.723
Hey, if anything,
you need to be freed, you know?

09:28.901 --> 09:33.304
From the shackles of a steady relationship...

09:33.472 --> 09:38.102
...with an attractive, successful man
who actually enjoys cooking.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.245
Fuck, this is really depressing.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.143
It's just, Luke is my partner in crime.

09:43.316 --> 09:47.446
He's the person I want to wake up with
and I want to go to bed with.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.885
He's the whole reason I went back to school
to get my PhD.

09:51.057 --> 09:53.958
Now I can't even afford to do that
without splitting the bills.

09:54.126 --> 09:56.219
That is not true. You can still go to school.

09:56.395 --> 09:59.489
Work at your mom's restaurant part-time
like after we graduated.

09:59.665 --> 10:03.032
What are we gonna do about our friends?
How do we split them up?

10:03.202 --> 10:06.433
- I mean, you don't really have that many friends.
- That's true.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.435
Except for Henry.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.132
Henry is a mutual friend.

10:10.309 --> 10:13.005
Honestly, Lo, this is good. You know?

10:13.179 --> 10:15.010
You met Luke yourjunior year abroad.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.546
I mean, you were a baby.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.809
You need to be on your own again...

10:18.985 --> 10:23.046
...dating other people, letting them stick it in,
knowing what that feels like.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.518
You've never been with anyone else.

10:25.691 --> 10:27.158
That's not good for character.

10:27.326 --> 10:28.350
You know? Look at me.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.427
Being single builds character.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.125
Ugh. Oh, I'm sore.

10:34.934 --> 10:37.129
<i>- Who is it?
Hey, it's Henry.</i>

10:38.504 --> 10:39.528
Okay, come in.

10:39.705 --> 10:42.697
- I gotta go wash my vagina.
- Why?

10:42.875 --> 10:45.070
What, you neverjust washed your vagina?

10:50.816 --> 10:53.250
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:53.419 --> 10:57.116
This is a consolation lasagna.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.257
Just put it there.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.485
I'm so sorry.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.257
I don't know if you
want to see me right now or...

11:06.899 --> 11:08.890
I don't know if
I want to see you right now.

11:09.068 --> 11:11.093
You look terrible.

11:12.204 --> 11:14.764
I know it's weird.

11:16.075 --> 11:18.100
You don't have to pick a side.

11:18.277 --> 11:19.767
No, I know I don't have to.

11:19.945 --> 11:22.004
Are you serious? You have to pick a side.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.941
You are prettier than him.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.414
And I'm a better person.

11:26.886 --> 11:27.978
So you say.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.883
She's like Mother Teresa!

11:30.056 --> 11:31.250
Only younger.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.885
But not that much younger.

11:35.061 --> 11:39.623
This is number one on Yelp
for best bar in a scary neighborhood.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.057
You're gonna love it.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.638
- It's crowded.
- I'm dressed for a barbecue.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.400
- Okay, let's get a drink.
- Okay.

11:52.311 --> 11:54.541
<i>If I gave you all my heart
Would you take it?</i>

11:55.181 --> 11:56.910
<i>Would you break it?</i>

11:57.083 --> 12:00.644
<i>Would you take it?
Don't matter to me</i>

12:07.426 --> 12:08.518
Hello.

12:08.694 --> 12:10.491
<i>Would you tell me that we're through?</i>

12:10.663 --> 12:12.494
<i>Can't tell me it wasrt true</i>

12:12.665 --> 12:15.327
Excuse me? Bartendress?

12:16.168 --> 12:19.467
<i>Or would you lie to me?</i>

12:19.638 --> 12:21.970
Oh, here she is.

12:23.843 --> 12:25.310
- Good? Good?
- Oh, yeah.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.502
- Good?
- Yeah.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.180
What's happening?
- I'm...

12:31.350 --> 12:34.683
- Let it out.
- I'm having a panic attack.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.015
- Okay, okay. Let's go.
Okay, okay.

12:37.189 --> 12:38.281
Keep going. Excuse us.

12:38.457 --> 12:39.515
It's okay.
Sorry.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.159
Bye!

12:44.597 --> 12:45.859
Sorry. Excuse us.

12:46.031 --> 12:48.192
- You okay? Do I need to call 911?
- No. No.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.028
Okay, look, breathe, breathe.

12:50.202 --> 12:52.329
It's okay. Everything's okay. Look at me.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.564
Slow, slow it down.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.605
Good. It's just a bar, okay?

12:56.776 --> 12:57.936
It's just a bar.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.237
Everything's fine. I'm right here.

13:00.412 --> 13:01.640
Okay?

13:02.848 --> 13:04.509
Can you get me a cab?

13:04.683 --> 13:07.447
Yeah, yeah. Just wait right here.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.178
Hold on, I see one.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.379
Oh, taxi?

13:14.794 --> 13:17.854
Hi. Sorry, can you just wait one second?

13:18.030 --> 13:20.999
Hi. Are you at home?

13:24.804 --> 13:27.272
Do you have any of that tea
that makes you skinny?

13:27.439 --> 13:32.604
No, but I crushed as many amphetamines
as I could in here, so that should do the trick.

13:35.614 --> 13:36.876
I feel like an idiot.

13:37.049 --> 13:39.244
I feel like everyone saw it coming but me.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.886
Nobody saw it. It was like fucking lightning.

13:42.054 --> 13:45.182
- He didn't say anything to you?
- Never.

13:45.357 --> 13:48.053
I mean, all he wanted to do
was have fun when we were out.

13:48.227 --> 13:53.028
I mean, sometimes he'd pretend like he wasrt
in a relationship, but that's what guys do.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.690
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.

13:55.868 --> 13:57.392
Did he cheat on me or...?

13:57.570 --> 13:59.197
No.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.802
Hey, he would never.

14:03.309 --> 14:06.301
I feel like men are always looking
for someone better...

14:06.478 --> 14:08.946
...and women are just looking
for whatever works.

14:09.114 --> 14:10.445
Well, I don't feel like that.

14:10.616 --> 14:13.676
I just want to meet someone
I can hang out with all the time...

14:13.853 --> 14:16.617
...eat bologna with, read shit to me.

14:16.789 --> 14:20.281
- I had that person.
- Hey.

14:22.061 --> 14:25.724
Do you remember that time when we did
mushrooms at your parents' country house?

14:25.898 --> 14:26.956
Yeah.

14:27.132 --> 14:29.726
And you made us go into
that swamp full of nasty shit...

14:29.902 --> 14:32.370
...because you thought
we owed it to the plant life?

14:32.538 --> 14:35.336
- The plants needed us.
- Right. And then you were convinced...

14:35.507 --> 14:38.442
...that we wouldn't get out of there,
and I calmed you down...

14:38.611 --> 14:41.603
...by singing that slow version
of "Girls Just Want to Have Fun. "

14:41.780 --> 14:43.304
We went back in the house and...

14:43.482 --> 14:46.974
Do you remember this story that
I'm telling you again in great detail?

14:47.152 --> 14:50.918
Yeah, it's the best worst night ever.

14:51.590 --> 14:54.616
- What's your point?
- I get you out of swamps.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.911
<i>Hey, it's me again.</i>

15:17.082 --> 15:18.845
<i>It doesn't have to be like this, Lo.</i>

15:19.018 --> 15:24.388
<i>We could still talk
and be in each other's lives, you know?</i>

15:25.991 --> 15:27.788
<i>Hey, it's me again.</i>

15:27.960 --> 15:29.825
<i>You're killing me here.</i>

15:29.995 --> 15:32.225
<i>At least let me know you're okay.</i>

15:32.398 --> 15:34.593
<i>All your stuff is here.</i>

15:35.434 --> 15:37.834
<i>Call me, please.</i>

15:40.439 --> 15:43.966
I haven't changed my underwear
in three days.

15:44.143 --> 15:49.581
Listen, Mom, do you think you could go over
to his place and just pick up my stuff?

15:50.749 --> 15:53.718
I can't do it. I just...

15:54.386 --> 15:58.880
Yeah, just bring it back to my old apartment.
Yeah, use the key that I gave you.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.993
Oh, thank you, Mom.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.992
I love you too.

16:04.163 --> 16:07.394
Okay, I'm gonna go elliptical. Bye.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.548
Yeah, I'll be right there.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.769
You go wild?

16:45.237 --> 16:46.829
What?

16:47.006 --> 16:50.874
- The salmon, did you buy wild?
- Oh.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.278
No, it seems pretty tame to me.

16:54.813 --> 16:57.373
I know there are more important things
to worry about...

16:57.549 --> 17:01.076
...but when you buy fish,
you should try to pay attention to that.

17:01.253 --> 17:03.949
Gotta honor your body, you know?
I'm Nick.

17:04.123 --> 17:05.282
- Hi. Lola.
- Hi.

17:05.457 --> 17:08.118
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.085
Bye.

17:12.297 --> 17:13.958
Anything from Nova Scotia?

17:21.507 --> 17:23.441
Do you shop here a lot?

17:26.412 --> 17:27.878
I can't be picked up right now.

17:28.047 --> 17:32.006
I appreciate the interest,
but I'm in a really bad place.

17:32.418 --> 17:33.942
Gotcha.

17:36.655 --> 17:38.885
I would love to cook you dinner sometime.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.958
Something fresh-caught.

17:41.126 --> 17:43.151
Well, not... Not by me.

17:43.328 --> 17:44.488
Fresh-bought.

17:44.663 --> 17:48.997
Oh, I don't really like fish.
I'm just eating this because it's salty.

17:50.969 --> 17:54.632
You know, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna give you my number.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.238
You may use it, you may not.

18:02.481 --> 18:03.641
If you do...

18:05.184 --> 18:07.243
...I'm free...

18:07.419 --> 18:09.353
...a week from Friday.

18:09.521 --> 18:11.352
After 7.

18:12.224 --> 18:14.454
But I could do 6:30.

18:28.474 --> 18:32.604
Okay, Leo. "It's time to fasten
your seat belt, kitty cat. Don't hiss at me.

18:32.778 --> 18:37.078
With Uranus, the planet of
lightning-bolt surprises...

18:37.249 --> 18:39.877
...you really never know which way is up.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.486
This is going to be a shitty month. "

18:43.122 --> 18:45.215
He said,
"This is going to be a shitty month"?

18:45.390 --> 18:47.551
<i>It's the Voice. They write what they know.</i>

18:48.494 --> 18:52.624
- You know, your mom and I broke up once.
- You did?

18:52.798 --> 18:55.665
Yeah, we decided to date other people.

18:55.834 --> 18:59.133
Seemed like a fun idea, but then we realized
that nobody else really compared.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.033
Heh. Uh...

19:01.373 --> 19:04.934
- Do you think that'll happen to me and Luke?
- No. No, I don't. I hate Luke.

19:05.110 --> 19:08.568
I de-friended him on Facebook already.
He's out.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.342
Thanks.

20:15.847 --> 20:19.112
Okay, love, fuck or kill?

20:19.284 --> 20:23.084
Heh, heh. Hilary Duff, Haylie Duff...

20:23.255 --> 20:25.849
...or any of the Fannings.

20:26.858 --> 20:28.883
You realize they're not related, right?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.392
I'm pretty sure they are.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.690
Wait, I think it's "marry, fuck, kill. "

20:35.067 --> 20:38.366
What's...? How...? How is it different?

20:39.271 --> 20:44.265
Because I think the assumption is if you...
After you're married, that you don't fuck.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.104
- Right.
- Yeah.

20:46.278 --> 20:48.974
- I guess I dodged a bullet, then.
- Pfft.

20:50.015 --> 20:51.107
That was...

21:08.500 --> 21:09.899
Ooh.

21:23.548 --> 21:25.106
Wake up.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.310
Oh, shit.

21:32.357 --> 21:33.847
You want breakfast?

21:34.026 --> 21:36.460
No. I have to go.

21:38.230 --> 21:40.460
Here, help me. I have no core.

21:58.550 --> 22:01.178
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:01.353 --> 22:06.086
I'm sorry to surprise you like this,
but you didn't call me back.

22:06.258 --> 22:07.987
Can I talk to you for a sec?

22:08.794 --> 22:12.753
I'm really late for this meeting.
I don't think I can right now.

22:12.931 --> 22:16.924
Yeah, but, look, wait, wait...
Please, just wait a second?

22:18.236 --> 22:19.362
What's that green thing?

22:20.572 --> 22:23.166
Oh. I'm cleansing.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.533
I drink it out of this thing.

22:26.144 --> 22:27.236
The potion.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.846
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it does.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.277
That's good.

22:31.450 --> 22:34.544
So I'm... I've been...

22:35.420 --> 22:37.513
...you know, thinking about things and...

22:37.689 --> 22:42.092
I don't know,
I might have acted irrationally.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.353
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

22:45.464 --> 22:47.989
I'm... I'm confused.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.167
Are you seriously doing this right now...

22:51.336 --> 22:54.772
...right before I have to go in
and argue about my dissertation?

22:54.940 --> 22:57.773
Shit. I'm sorry. I didn't know.
You didn't return my calls.

22:57.943 --> 23:00.173
I've been really busy.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.306
Look, I...

23:04.816 --> 23:07.250
I know this came out of nowhere...

23:07.419 --> 23:12.857
...and I think I was just overwhelmed
by everything that was happening and...

23:13.859 --> 23:14.883
And now I just...

23:15.060 --> 23:17.995
Are you just doing this
because you're lonely?

23:18.497 --> 23:20.089
No.

23:20.265 --> 23:23.325
I just really wanted to see you.

23:24.369 --> 23:26.462
I really...

23:26.638 --> 23:28.299
...have to go.

23:29.841 --> 23:31.240
Wait.

23:56.568 --> 24:01.505
Essentially, I'll be investigating the use
of silence in 19th-century French literature.

24:01.673 --> 24:04.540
- Are you still using the poetry of Mallarmé?
Yes.

24:04.709 --> 24:08.839
I want to really look at his obsession
with the blank page...

24:09.014 --> 24:13.713
...really exploring the ways in which
his verses engender silence.

24:14.286 --> 24:19.815
I would also like to look at silence
in the media and popular culture.

24:19.991 --> 24:22.789
Well, more of the lack thereof.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.725
Just our communal...

24:25.897 --> 24:30.231
...almost deathly fear of silence.

24:38.343 --> 24:40.470
I don't know what I want.

24:42.414 --> 24:46.009
- Should I give you guys some more time?
- We'll be ready in a minute.

24:46.184 --> 24:48.118
Just stand there.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.511
Um...

24:51.223 --> 24:52.383
I'll have the...

24:52.557 --> 24:56.584
...gnocchi and a glass of the "sangreesha. "

24:57.362 --> 25:00.525
Do you mean sangria?

25:00.699 --> 25:02.098
I'm... We don't have that.

25:02.267 --> 25:04.201
- Do you have wine?
- Yes.

25:04.369 --> 25:06.303
Put fruit cocktail in it.

25:06.471 --> 25:09.235
- Go.
- I'll get that for you.

25:16.081 --> 25:19.107
Can you put fruit cocktail
in a glass of wine for me?

25:20.552 --> 25:23.885
- Hey, Randy. How's the bar stock?
- Pretty empty, like my bank account.

25:24.055 --> 25:25.249
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.948
How are you doing, sweetie? You okay?

25:28.126 --> 25:30.424
- I'm choosing to be alive.
- Well, good.

25:30.595 --> 25:34.429
Listen, I have something really important
to talk to you about, all right?

25:34.599 --> 25:36.794
- Okay.
- Okay, not here. Let's...

25:37.335 --> 25:41.829
I was thinking about this in the taxi yesterday
when I was watching that little TV set.

25:42.007 --> 25:43.406
Right.

25:43.909 --> 25:46.469
- It's about freezing.
- Freezing?

25:46.645 --> 25:49.409
Think you might want to think about
freezing the eggs.

25:49.581 --> 25:50.912
The eggs?

25:51.082 --> 25:54.176
- My eggs?
- Yes, those eggs.

25:54.352 --> 25:55.649
Oh, come on, Mom.

25:55.820 --> 25:58.414
I am not gonna have children anytime soon.

25:58.590 --> 26:01.559
Well, exactly my point. You will.

26:01.726 --> 26:05.127
They do it in a great facility. Trust me.
My friend Debbie did it.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.060
She has eggs all over the city.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.132
Six happy children.

26:09.301 --> 26:12.065
Well, one of them's a giant, but very nice.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.967
That's so depressing.
I am already depressed.

26:15.140 --> 26:18.371
- Could you let me grieve, please?
- Grieve, grieve. We're all grieving.

26:18.543 --> 26:21.103
But I'm just trying to think practically
on your behalf.

26:21.279 --> 26:23.440
You're not getting any younger.
They shrivel.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.913
Could we just talk about something else?

26:28.520 --> 26:30.488
I don't fucking know.

26:38.163 --> 26:40.825
Sangreesha, house specialty.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.945
<i>You wanna hear
You broke my heart</i>

26:59.117 --> 27:00.584
<i>You broke my heart</i>

27:02.020 --> 27:06.582
<i>I wanna hear
You're gonna finish what you start</i>

27:08.259 --> 27:09.851
<i>You wanna put</i>

27:10.061 --> 27:12.655
Hell really is bright.

27:13.164 --> 27:15.655
I always forget that Times Square exists.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.529
Yeah, it does.

27:17.702 --> 27:19.329
For all time, it's been here.

27:19.504 --> 27:21.563
All these lights make me nauseous.

27:44.129 --> 27:46.723
I...

27:46.898 --> 27:48.559
I...

27:48.733 --> 27:51.930
- Hi.
- Hi!

28:06.051 --> 28:08.417
Remember when I had a beard
like that in college?

28:08.586 --> 28:09.678
It was awful.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.378
I looked hot.

28:12.190 --> 28:15.591
Poor Alice, she just keeps getting cast
as these peasants.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.228
Was that sign language
she was doing part of the play?

28:18.396 --> 28:20.728
- Or was she translating for someone?
- I don't know.

28:20.899 --> 28:22.867
No, she did this dream therapy workshop...

28:23.034 --> 28:28.870
...where she said her and her character melded
in a past life as a deaf-mute.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.203
Ah. She looked great.
And what was up with the lead guy, Roger?

28:32.377 --> 28:34.538
- It was like he was half asleep.
- I don't know.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.375
He was terrible.
I don't know why she's obsessed with him.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.573
- She's obsessed?
- Yeah.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.513
Why? She could do way better.

28:43.822 --> 28:46.120
Congratulations.
Yay! I loved it.

28:46.291 --> 28:48.384
- Thank you.
- Oh, I had an off night.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.188
You were great too.

28:51.362 --> 28:54.820
I accidentally took a Xanax before this show.
I thought it was an Advil.

28:54.999 --> 28:57.263
That's insane. You're insane.
You're so talented.

28:57.435 --> 29:00.029
I couldn't tell at all.
- I basically directed myself.

29:00.205 --> 29:01.365
- Yeah.
- Director's a hack.

29:01.539 --> 29:05.134
Some Yale grad, whatever.
I'm actually adapting this for the screen.

29:05.310 --> 29:07.278
I got so much inside and it just...

29:07.445 --> 29:10.778
You know, I'm so...
I'm fucking talented, you know?

29:10.949 --> 29:12.143
I know it inside.

29:12.317 --> 29:15.912
So okay, tell me, was I okay?
Did you see me? Did I find my light?

29:16.087 --> 29:19.579
You were so believable. Heh.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.020
Why are you laughing?

29:21.192 --> 29:24.184
Was I too much? Was it over the top?
Because I can bring it down.

29:24.362 --> 29:27.388
I can make it, you know,
less viewpointy, more Congo.

29:27.565 --> 29:28.759
What does that even mean?

29:29.267 --> 29:32.759
The whole thing is a metaphor
for genital mutilation.

29:33.271 --> 29:36.798
- Did you not get that?
- Oh...

29:39.377 --> 29:43.814
- Do you want me to carry your thermos?
- Oh, yeah. That would be awesome.

29:48.419 --> 29:51.252
So this is weird, I'm sorry...

29:51.422 --> 29:55.483
...but do you think that you could
stay over with me tonight?

29:55.660 --> 29:58.424
Nights are really hard.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.493
Uh...

30:02.200 --> 30:03.224
Sure.

30:03.401 --> 30:04.891
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:05.069 --> 30:06.969
Thanks. I know it's weird. I just...

30:07.138 --> 30:10.107
- No, no, no. Totally, totally, totally.
- I appreciate it. Okay.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.301
Why are you waving at me?

30:14.479 --> 30:16.037
Waving good night.

30:17.248 --> 30:19.648
Don't sleep on the couch.

30:21.052 --> 30:22.383
What's your thread count?

30:22.554 --> 30:25.216
Like... two.

30:25.690 --> 30:27.089
Cool.

30:28.159 --> 30:32.493
<i>Just a-being in your service</i>

30:32.664 --> 30:37.397
- Ha-ha-ha.
- It's the tapered leg on the... Ahem.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.867
<i>They evince the troubled, nimble wit</i>

30:40.038 --> 30:42.529
<i>Oh, nothing in return</i>

30:42.707 --> 30:45.198
<i>But storm and pessimism</i>

30:45.376 --> 30:47.003
Oh.

30:48.246 --> 30:50.214
<i>Being good for me</i>

30:50.381 --> 30:56.047
<i>And just a-standing in your pretty prison</i>

30:56.221 --> 30:59.122
- Thanks for staying over.
- Yeah, of course.

31:03.261 --> 31:06.697
Oh, God, Luke would kill me
if he knew I was in your bed.

31:06.865 --> 31:11.529
I'm pretty sure that Luke
no longer has jurisdiction over these parts.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.899
Yeah, that's true.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.601
<i>Being good for me</i>

31:20.778 --> 31:25.613
<i>And just a-standing in your pretty prison</i>

31:25.783 --> 31:29.219
<i>You're standing here</i>

31:33.791 --> 31:40.287
<i>You think you love me</i>

31:41.432 --> 31:44.663
<i>Don't you?</i>

31:48.973 --> 31:51.840
<i>Maybe you're the presence</i>

31:52.010 --> 31:55.707
<i>That begs needing other reasons</i>

31:55.880 --> 31:59.441
<i>I got "Summer still looks pretty"</i>

31:59.617 --> 32:03.747
<i>I got hungry for the hungry seas</i>

32:03.922 --> 32:06.447
Stop. We can't do this.

32:07.191 --> 32:08.749
Yes, we can. It's fine.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.622
No, Luke's a good friend.

32:10.795 --> 32:12.626
Yeah, but you're my best friend.

32:12.797 --> 32:14.389
I'm a rebound.

32:14.565 --> 32:16.590
No, you're more of a layup.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.861
Oh, I feel like I'm breaking code.

32:19.037 --> 32:23.440
I don't know what the rules are
in this situation.

32:23.608 --> 32:26.509
We can make up the rules.
We don't have to have sex.

32:26.678 --> 32:27.940
I don't...

32:28.112 --> 32:31.206
Well, you know I've always
had feelings for you.

32:31.816 --> 32:34.182
No, I didn't know that.

32:37.021 --> 32:39.854
Yeah, so I think we should...

32:40.024 --> 32:44.961
We should just be careful, you know,
and take it slow.

32:45.163 --> 32:48.326
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:49.334 --> 32:51.529
- Good night.
- Good night.

33:41.586 --> 33:42.917
Luke.

33:43.087 --> 33:44.952
Yeah, it's me.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.486
I really miss you.

33:51.929 --> 33:53.920
Can I see you?

33:58.836 --> 34:00.463
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

34:00.972 --> 34:03.668
- What am I doing? I don't know what I'm doing.
- Okay, look.

34:03.841 --> 34:05.706
Here, open your mouth.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.004
Ugh! What? What's that?

34:08.179 --> 34:09.271
- Weed in a bottle.
- What?

34:09.447 --> 34:12.041
Freshens the breath
and gets you fucked up, dude.

34:12.216 --> 34:16.414
I got it in Koreatown last time I was in L.A.
Smuggled it in my cooch pouch on the plane.

34:16.587 --> 34:19.556
- I am going to kill you!
- Here. Relax!

34:19.724 --> 34:21.748
God! Put this weed candy
under your tongue.

34:21.926 --> 34:24.018
- Stop it! You need help.
- You don't want this?

34:24.195 --> 34:25.786
- No.
- Are you sure?

34:25.963 --> 34:27.487
- Yes.
- Okay.

34:27.665 --> 34:30.793
- What exactly is the point of this meeting?
- I need closure.

34:30.967 --> 34:33.869
I don't know. I don't know what I need.
I'm hot. Is it hot out?

34:34.038 --> 34:37.337
- Feel like I'm gonna be sick. It smells like sulfur.
- Lola:

34:42.380 --> 34:44.177
What does that last part mean?

34:44.348 --> 34:47.511
"You don't have a wife yet,
but you named your son Somalingam. "

34:47.685 --> 34:49.812
- Ancient Indian proverb.
- What?

34:49.987 --> 34:52.922
Find your spirit animal
and ride it till its dick falls off.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.114
- All right?
- Right.

34:54.292 --> 34:55.315
- All right.
- Okay.

34:55.493 --> 34:56.551
- Go get him.
- I'm going.

34:56.726 --> 34:58.024
- I got your back.
- I love it.

34:58.196 --> 35:00.027
I love you.

35:01.466 --> 35:02.763
All right.

35:06.404 --> 35:09.373
How's the dissertation coming?

35:09.574 --> 35:12.543
Slowly. The silence is killing me.

35:14.212 --> 35:15.679
How's the painting?

35:15.847 --> 35:17.508
It's really good.

35:17.682 --> 35:20.014
I've been getting a lot of work done and...

35:20.318 --> 35:21.945
Wow.

35:23.354 --> 35:24.548
Are you okay?

35:24.722 --> 35:26.553
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:30.394 --> 35:31.418
<i>What?</i>

35:34.899 --> 35:36.833
Think I'm gonna...

35:46.878 --> 35:51.315
I'm just trying to figure out
what I'm eating or...

35:58.122 --> 36:00.420
How long did you know?

36:00.591 --> 36:01.922
Know what?

36:02.093 --> 36:04.061
That you were gonna leave me.

36:05.129 --> 36:07.188
I mean, honestly?

36:07.632 --> 36:09.429
Not long.

36:10.034 --> 36:14.164
I mean, I think it was when
the whole wedding started to feel real.

36:14.338 --> 36:18.240
You know, with your family
and the flowers and the plane tickets.

36:18.409 --> 36:19.899
And suddenly I was just...

36:20.077 --> 36:23.672
- Dude, were you just pretending to love me?
- No.

36:24.482 --> 36:26.279
Of course not.

36:26.450 --> 36:28.941
So, what are we doing?

36:31.055 --> 36:32.852
I don't know.

37:17.268 --> 37:18.929
Hey.

37:19.103 --> 37:21.071
Please, don't cry.

37:22.406 --> 37:25.000
I don't think I can see you anymore.

37:27.878 --> 37:29.368
Why?

37:31.515 --> 37:35.007
It's too painful.

37:37.188 --> 37:41.147
But if we're both missing each other,
I don't see why...

37:41.325 --> 37:43.520
I just can't.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.748
- Hey.
- What the heck happened to you?

39:11.916 --> 39:14.544
<i>You went AWOL for three hours.
I thought he killed you...</i>

39:14.719 --> 39:17.017
<i>...and disappeared to the Catskills.
- We had sex.</i>

39:17.188 --> 39:21.284
<i>Yeah, I saw a 20/20 like that.
In fact, girl who's supposed to be married...</i>

39:21.459 --> 39:24.087
<i>...head found severed near
a Jewish community center.</i>

39:24.261 --> 39:25.558
Are you listening to me?

39:25.730 --> 39:27.960
I said we had sex.

39:28.132 --> 39:29.258
<i>Yes, I'm listening.</i>

39:29.433 --> 39:31.333
Wait, what did you say?

39:34.071 --> 39:37.598
It's like he's good for me,
but he's bad for me.

39:37.775 --> 39:39.242
- Yeah.
- You know?

39:39.410 --> 39:42.675
The guy who's supposed to make me
feel safe is actually dangerous...

39:42.847 --> 39:45.111
...which just makes me
want to have sex with him.

39:45.282 --> 39:47.944
I'm drunk. I love macrobiotic food.

39:48.119 --> 39:50.019
Who puts your sentences together?

39:50.187 --> 39:52.246
Honestly, your brain is like a bad DJ.

39:52.423 --> 39:56.860
- It was terrible. I had to see him.
- Yeah. Well, hey, at least you got options.

39:57.027 --> 40:01.020
Me, I can't find someone to love me
momentarily during orgasm...

40:01.198 --> 40:04.292
...which is really an easy moment
to love someone fleetingly, no?

40:05.102 --> 40:07.366
- What happened?
- Roger wouldn't have sex with me.

40:07.538 --> 40:09.301
- Oh, boy.
- Like I was some refugee.

40:09.473 --> 40:13.409
Then I went and got drunk by myself,
unless a bottle of Kahlúa counts as a partner...

40:13.577 --> 40:16.444
...then went back
and hate-fucked him two times.

40:16.614 --> 40:18.241
Yeah. I don't know, I don't know.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.748
Maybe you're right,
maybe I should just date Henry.

40:20.918 --> 40:23.045
Oh, God. Um...

40:24.121 --> 40:26.749
- We made out.
- What?

40:27.391 --> 40:30.519
Ba-ba-ba. Back up the train.
Why didn't you tell me?

40:30.694 --> 40:33.162
- Because I didn't want you to judge me.
- Judge you?

40:33.764 --> 40:37.291
I don't know, I think I like him?

40:37.468 --> 40:39.060
Okay. Wow, okay.

40:39.236 --> 40:42.228
Should I slit my wrists now
orjust wait till after the meal?

40:42.406 --> 40:46.137
Oh, stop it. You are going to find someone
just the second you stop looking.

40:47.111 --> 40:50.478
- Have you been on Match. com lately?
- Seriously, now.

40:51.182 --> 40:54.345
What am I eating? This is just gas in a box.

40:54.518 --> 40:56.076
Come on. What are you, old?

40:56.253 --> 41:01.213
I'm sorry, I didn't realize that we would be
tracing the New York City Marathon route.

41:01.659 --> 41:04.059
- We're here.
- Where?

41:04.228 --> 41:06.526
Neil Sedaka's house.

41:06.997 --> 41:08.862
Never wondered where Neil Sedaka lives?

41:09.033 --> 41:12.127
No. Should I be expecting a lot
of Neil Sedaka covers at your show?

41:12.303 --> 41:13.497
How weird does it sound...

41:13.671 --> 41:16.538
...to say "Neil Sedaka" this many times?
- Neil Sedaka, Neil Sedaka, Neil Sedaka.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.500
<i>And we'll watch</i>

41:21.912 --> 41:24.642

Hey.

42:31.148 --> 42:34.174
- What happened to you?
- I spray-tanned. What happened to you?

42:34.351 --> 42:37.650
I don't see you for two weeks,
and now you're ethnically ambiguous.

42:37.821 --> 42:39.379
It's a conversation starter.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.024
- I wanna get closer.
- Yeah, good.

42:41.191 --> 42:44.092
I want to start telling people
I was on vacation.

42:45.329 --> 42:47.889
Hi, I'm 30, I'm looking to have children.
How are you?

42:48.065 --> 42:49.089
You're 29.

Great. I just got back from vacation.

43:40.284 --> 43:42.275
Well, I'm just watching my friend.

43:42.486 --> 43:44.215
He's a singer.

43:44.388 --> 43:46.583
So funny. My friend just dragged me along.

43:46.757 --> 43:48.816
She knows someone in the band too.

- Are you dating her?
- No. No, I'm not.

You're unbelievable!

I thought that you said
that you wanted time alone.

I did. I do.

This is what we should be doing.

44:44.748 --> 44:46.181
You should be doing it too.

44:46.350 --> 44:48.614
Did you know her while we were together?

44:48.786 --> 44:52.222
Just socially. I wasrt cheating on you,
if that's what you're getting at.

44:52.389 --> 44:54.482
I mean, we just recently started hanging out.

44:54.658 --> 44:58.754
Yes, I know that you started hanging out,
because I read your text messages!

44:58.929 --> 45:01.193
What? Why would you do that?

45:01.365 --> 45:05.665
Why would I trust you?
You're so selfish and good-looking!

45:05.836 --> 45:08.304
Stop being a martyr, all right?

45:08.472 --> 45:10.372
Sometimes you have to be selfish.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.099
I was never selfish.

45:12.276 --> 45:14.540
I always put you before me.

45:14.745 --> 45:16.269
Yeah, maybe that was the problem.

Yep! Must make you feel weird that
I'm dating your best friend.

45:31.929 --> 45:34.830
But I'm doing it because
I guess that's what I should be doing.

45:34.998 --> 45:36.989
No, no, I'm glad it's him.

45:37.167 --> 45:38.759
Yeah, she's not even into him.

But whatevs, it's super "cazh. "

- I'm gonna go throw up.
- Me too. I'm gonna throw up too.

45:46.143 --> 45:49.510
I can't believe he's dating somebody else.

45:50.214 --> 45:52.512
This is very, very dirty.

45:52.683 --> 45:53.843
But you know what, honey?

45:54.017 --> 45:56.577
You are dating someone else too.

45:57.387 --> 45:58.911
Do you want to dance?

45:59.089 --> 46:01.080
Now? A site-specific bathroom dance party?

46:01.258 --> 46:03.692
- No, like I gotta get out of here.
- Oh, yeah.

46:03.861 --> 46:05.795
- Okay?
- Yeah, let's go.

46:07.297 --> 46:09.128
Listen, I'm sorry, I know it's shitty...

46:09.299 --> 46:10.630
Did you fuck her?

46:10.801 --> 46:13.167
No, I swear.

46:13.337 --> 46:15.168
Hey. That was so great.
- Hey.

46:17.207 --> 46:20.005
Your new boyfriend and me
had a little chitchat.

46:20.177 --> 46:21.201
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

46:21.378 --> 46:23.778
- Was it fun?
- Great.

46:23.947 --> 46:26.472
I mean, out of all people.

46:26.650 --> 46:27.912
I mean, really.

46:28.085 --> 46:30.178
Dude, it's not like it was planned.

46:30.354 --> 46:31.616
You sure about that?

46:32.189 --> 46:35.852
- Well, it's not as planned as your wedding.
- Hey, fuck you!

46:36.026 --> 46:37.857
I have food poisoning.

46:38.028 --> 46:40.588
I gotta load out, so...

46:40.764 --> 46:43.062
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- I won't.

46:43.233 --> 46:46.202
Touché. We're going.

47:02.219 --> 47:05.017
<i>I'm gonna get my bathing suit on
Gonna get my base face on</i>

47:05.189 --> 47:07.817
<i>Gonna get my hat out of loan
Gonna get my space face on</i>

47:07.991 --> 47:10.789
<i>I'm gonna turn all snakes into bone
Go wishing the stone</i>

47:10.961 --> 47:13.589
<i>Keep the crystal cat cold
Gotta get to the throne</i>

47:13.764 --> 47:16.164
<i>Hope my baby
May we meet a beastman</i>

47:16.333 --> 47:18.893
<i>Hold us there
Happy but by one hand</i>

47:19.069 --> 47:21.037
<i>Gonna get my pile of stone</i>

47:30.347 --> 47:31.371
<i>Hello?</i>

47:31.548 --> 47:34.608
It's Lola! It's me! Let me in, please!

47:34.785 --> 47:36.912
<i>It's 4 in the morning.</i>

47:44.561 --> 47:47.189
Dude, stop. You're really drunk.

47:52.436 --> 47:53.903
- Oh, are you close?
- Yeah.

47:54.071 --> 47:56.301
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

48:07.150 --> 48:10.244
- Yeah? Oh. Mm.
- Yeah. Yeah.

48:23.934 --> 48:27.631
So, what do you sound like
when you really come?

48:38.515 --> 48:40.483
I don't know.

48:40.651 --> 48:45.179
I guess I'm... quieter.

48:49.459 --> 48:51.586
When you told Luke
that I was your boyfriend...

48:51.762 --> 48:54.697
...did you say that
just to make him mad or...?

48:56.600 --> 49:00.969
I don't know. I'm so messed up right now.

49:02.639 --> 49:03.833
Hey.

49:06.476 --> 49:08.501
You're not messing anything up.

49:08.679 --> 49:10.647
You know, we don't have to label anything.

49:10.814 --> 49:14.215
We can just be.

49:20.557 --> 49:25.153
You know, in the '70s,
folks like you were with a lot of people.

49:25.329 --> 49:26.523
Made sense.

49:26.697 --> 49:28.858
Yeah, they had a lot of STDs.

49:29.032 --> 49:35.062
Well, hey, remember, it's not perfect fidelity,
it's high fidelity.

49:35.238 --> 49:38.401
Dad, what kind of
bumper-sticker crap is that?

49:38.575 --> 49:40.702
That's not crap, that's wisdom.

49:40.877 --> 49:43.311
There is a fine line.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.539
Thank you, sage father.

49:45.716 --> 49:49.117
Look, you know, I know that having
your mom and I as parents...

49:49.286 --> 49:51.550
...has kind of made you into
a stressed-out kid...

49:51.722 --> 49:55.488
...but you put a lot of pressure on yourself
to live out a life...

49:55.659 --> 49:59.026
...that maybe is a little more conventional
than what you were raised in.

49:59.196 --> 50:03.326
Sometimes it's good, you know,
to just shake life up a little bit.

50:03.500 --> 50:05.058
Let it fall out of your hands.

50:05.702 --> 50:06.896
You'll catch it.

50:07.070 --> 50:08.094
Mm-hm.

50:14.911 --> 50:18.438
You have such a musical voice.
Do you play any instruments or...?

50:18.615 --> 50:21.209
No, actually. I, um...

50:22.986 --> 50:25.181
Do you play any instruments?

50:25.355 --> 50:27.915
No. I'm much more visual.

50:28.091 --> 50:30.389
Yeah. Anyway, you asked me a question.

50:30.560 --> 50:37.159
No, I didn't want to be a prison architect.

50:37.334 --> 50:39.063
That just kind of happened.

50:39.236 --> 50:41.568
Mm. That's awesome.

50:42.205 --> 50:44.673
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

50:45.442 --> 50:46.466
Lola.

50:48.745 --> 50:51.441
You're a writer. What do you...

50:52.549 --> 50:53.914
...want to write about?

50:54.518 --> 50:55.985
Cats.

50:56.153 --> 50:59.145
- Cats.
- Like, the history of cats.

50:59.322 --> 51:01.756
There's something...

51:02.325 --> 51:05.886
...wonderfully feline about you.

51:06.063 --> 51:08.429
Meow. Ha-ha-ha.

51:10.167 --> 51:12.362
No, I was kidding.

51:12.536 --> 51:15.300
I thought, because
I loved literature so much...

51:15.472 --> 51:18.873
...that I'd want to write novels,
but I realized I didn't.

51:19.042 --> 51:21.602
I just want to write about them.

51:22.746 --> 51:23.872
So...

51:24.381 --> 51:26.679
It's very, very sexy.

51:31.121 --> 51:33.351
Can I pour you another glass of wine?

51:34.191 --> 51:35.351
- Okay.
- Yeah?

51:35.525 --> 51:38.016
- Yeah.
- Great.

51:39.463 --> 51:43.024
<i>Do you want to stick with the red?
We could do some sake.</i>

51:57.447 --> 52:00.143
Oh, I really like your knees.

52:00.317 --> 52:02.012
No, wait.

52:04.321 --> 52:07.154
Yeah, I really like your knees.

52:07.324 --> 52:09.087
Thanks.

52:10.127 --> 52:13.062
- You want me to put on some music?
- Okay.

52:24.975 --> 52:26.374
Oh, my God!

52:26.543 --> 52:28.568
I'm sorry. It just came out.

52:28.745 --> 52:31.145
That's okay. I know.

52:31.314 --> 52:32.713
It's freakishly big.

52:32.883 --> 52:36.876
- I can't stop looking.
- I was an incubator baby.

52:37.821 --> 52:41.382
- What?
- I was an incubator baby.

52:41.558 --> 52:42.889
Oh...

52:43.093 --> 52:45.186
What is that?

52:45.362 --> 52:50.265
The incubator, it made my penis bigger
than the other kids'.

52:50.800 --> 52:52.631
Oh, yeah.

52:52.802 --> 52:56.238
<i>To see how long our swan song can last</i>

52:56.840 --> 52:58.467
Oh, okay.

52:59.176 --> 53:00.939
Ooh. Whoa.

53:01.211 --> 53:03.145
That just slipped in there, huh?

53:06.449 --> 53:10.783
You feel so good.

53:11.254 --> 53:14.246
Just a minute. Shh. Be perfectly still.

53:14.424 --> 53:17.621
Is this...? Is this Ani DiFranco?

53:18.261 --> 53:21.230
Yeah. She's my favorite lyricist.

53:21.398 --> 53:22.797
Oh.

53:24.067 --> 53:27.400
<i>And I am watching your chest
Rise and fall</i>

53:27.571 --> 53:30.335
<i>Like the tides of my life</i>

53:30.507 --> 53:31.531
Could you...?

53:31.708 --> 53:34.700
<i>Your bones have been my bed frame
Your flesh has been my pillow</i>

53:34.878 --> 53:36.846
Do you think you could get a condom?

53:37.013 --> 53:38.378
Arert you on the pill?

53:38.548 --> 53:40.778
It doesn't matter.

53:40.984 --> 53:42.576
What are you worried about?

53:42.752 --> 53:45.118
I don't know if you're clean.

53:45.288 --> 53:46.915
I am.

53:47.591 --> 53:49.582
I just got tested.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.889
Scout's honor.

53:53.063 --> 53:54.724
Oh, okay, that's...

53:54.898 --> 53:58.595
That makes me feel better. The Boy Scouts.

53:58.768 --> 54:01.396
- Actually, I'm an Eagle.
- Oh.

54:05.242 --> 54:07.210
<i>And when we leave the landlord will come</i>

54:07.377 --> 54:09.743
<i>And paint over it all
And I am walking</i>

54:09.913 --> 54:11.710
<i>Out in the rain</i>

54:15.952 --> 54:18.443
Sure you don't want to get some breakfast?

54:18.888 --> 54:20.549
Omelet?

54:21.191 --> 54:23.853
I can be a few minutes late for class.

54:24.027 --> 54:26.427
You know, that's okay. Thanks.

54:28.999 --> 54:30.694
I had a really nice time last night.

54:31.468 --> 54:34.369
Yeah. Yeah.

54:35.572 --> 54:37.130
Let me roll you home.

54:37.707 --> 54:39.334
- Come on.
- Okay.

54:44.347 --> 54:45.439
Mm.

54:45.649 --> 54:47.344
Sweet architecture.

54:47.517 --> 54:50.111
It's really tight brickwork. Bravo.

54:52.055 --> 54:53.647
Hey.

54:57.961 --> 54:59.258
Henry.

55:00.063 --> 55:03.226
Hi. I'm Nick.

55:08.772 --> 55:09.932
All right.

55:10.106 --> 55:12.165
I better get to Pilates.

55:12.709 --> 55:16.509
Oh, can you give me a hand,
help me with this?

55:17.080 --> 55:19.708
Just really tight.

55:21.351 --> 55:24.980
Yeah, just really...
Like, really, really tight. Yeah.

55:26.356 --> 55:27.721
Yeah, okay. Great.

55:27.891 --> 55:29.518
Thank you.

55:30.093 --> 55:31.958
I'll call you later.

55:35.732 --> 55:37.700
Have a blessed day.

55:40.837 --> 55:42.634
What the fuck?

55:44.374 --> 55:46.205
What are you doing here?

55:46.376 --> 55:48.867
I came to surprise you with breakfast.

55:49.479 --> 55:51.879
- These are really nice scones.
- Oh, shit.

55:52.048 --> 55:55.711
Did you just have sex with that Rollerblader?

55:55.885 --> 55:57.477
Um...

55:58.488 --> 56:00.046
Oh, my God.

56:00.223 --> 56:01.554
I cannot believe you.

56:01.725 --> 56:04.751
I'm so sorry. It was terrible.

56:04.928 --> 56:09.297
If it's any consolation,
his dick was so big it hurt my back.

56:09.466 --> 56:11.832
Oh, he has a bigger dick than me too?

56:12.001 --> 56:13.195
No, that is a consolation.

56:13.370 --> 56:15.600
You should go into
the greeting card business.

56:15.772 --> 56:18.536
"Sorry I cheated on you.
PS, your dick is smaller. "

56:18.708 --> 56:23.042
- No, no, that's not... That's not what I meant.
- I just assumed that we were...

56:23.213 --> 56:24.805
- Yes, yes, yes, we are.
- Yeah?

56:24.981 --> 56:27.245
- I'm confused.
- Yeah, clearly.

56:27.417 --> 56:30.978
I'm vulnerable. I'm not myself.
I'm easily persuaded.

56:31.154 --> 56:34.248
What, so now you're saying
that I persuaded you to be with me?

56:34.424 --> 56:37.393
No. If anything,
I persuaded you to be with me.

56:37.560 --> 56:39.824
- Whatever.
- Wait. No, no. Henry, wait, wait, wait.

56:39.996 --> 56:43.488
I didn't know that we were exclusive,
and I didn't know.

56:43.666 --> 56:46.829
I didn't know if it was okay
if I slept with someone else.

56:47.003 --> 56:50.803
Do you know what? It doesn't have
to be articulated. It's just common courtesy.

56:54.744 --> 56:57.076
- Uh...
- Henry!

56:57.247 --> 57:00.011
Please, can we talk about this?

57:02.919 --> 57:06.878
I'm slutty, but I am a good person.

57:11.394 --> 57:16.696
<i>Oh honey, I really miss you</i>

57:18.401 --> 57:19.800
<i>Oh, honey</i>

57:21.171 --> 57:24.800
<i>Though it was only yesterday you kissed me</i>

57:25.542 --> 57:26.907
<i>And that kiss</i>

57:28.378 --> 57:32.371
<i>That kiss was so, so true</i>

57:33.216 --> 57:35.980
<i>I guess I should know better</i>

57:37.320 --> 57:40.653
- Hey.
- Hey, I was in the neighborhood.

57:40.824 --> 57:42.553
Oh, that's cool.

57:43.159 --> 57:44.524
Do you have any weed?

57:44.694 --> 57:46.958
<i>When it comes to falling</i>

57:47.363 --> 57:52.562
<i>Oh, honey, I really miss you</i>

57:53.803 --> 57:55.828
One, two, three.

57:57.474 --> 58:01.035
<i>If only you could hold me now</i>

58:01.878 --> 58:03.539
<i>Because you hold</i>

58:04.747 --> 58:08.774
<i>You hold me, oh, so well</i>

58:09.519 --> 58:12.420
<i>I guess I should know better</i>

58:13.156 --> 58:15.886
<i>When it comes to falling</i>

58:16.793 --> 58:19.387
<i>Yes, I should know better</i>

58:20.430 --> 58:25.925
<i>When it comes to falling in love again</i>

58:28.271 --> 58:30.535
I'm glad that you're staying here
when we're gone.

58:30.707 --> 58:34.040
It's good for you to get away
from all the noise out there.

58:34.210 --> 58:37.111
Fuck that noise!
- We'll be back in two weeks.

58:37.280 --> 58:40.613
Hey, why don't you throw a rave party?
Go wild.

58:40.783 --> 58:44.947
I can't throw a party. I'll just be thinking about
whether or not to invite Luke or Henry.

58:45.121 --> 58:47.715
Then if I don't invite them,
I'll just wish that I did.

58:47.891 --> 58:50.086
Honey, I really think
you're overanalyzing this.

58:50.260 --> 58:53.752
Then if I do invite them and they don't
show up, is it because they hate me?

58:53.930 --> 58:58.697
I just keep having sex
with the wrong people at the wrong time...

58:58.868 --> 59:00.995
...or the right people at the wrong time.

59:01.170 --> 59:03.536
Right time, wrong people!

59:03.740 --> 59:06.106
I should probably try
to be friends with them.

59:06.276 --> 59:08.540
I don't know. I can't tell.
I've never had an ex.

59:08.711 --> 59:11.202
Are you supposed to be friends
with your exes?

59:11.381 --> 59:12.871
Well, honey, sure.

59:13.049 --> 59:16.815
I mean, you know,
show Luke that you've moved on.

59:16.986 --> 59:19.978
Show Henry how you're sorry.
Be the bigger person.

59:20.890 --> 59:23.017
Oh, honey, we love you.

59:23.192 --> 59:24.284
A lot of people do.

59:24.460 --> 59:28.863
Unfortunately, you and Dad
do not count as a lot of people.

59:35.705 --> 59:37.696
Randy, I need you to help me with this.

59:37.874 --> 59:40.434
Are you kidding me?
That thing is like a walking toilet.

59:40.610 --> 59:42.475
- Please?
- Clearblue?

59:42.645 --> 59:45.205
- More like clear yellow.
- Tell me whether it's negative.

59:45.381 --> 59:48.441
I let a man I met at a fish store
do me without a condom.

59:48.618 --> 59:49.710
Okay, show me.

59:50.520 --> 59:52.454
Show me! Don't touch me.

59:53.189 --> 59:54.281
It's negative.

59:54.791 --> 59:59.819
I don't know why I do this to myself. It's like
I'm constantly attracted to men who punish me.

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:02.929
Maybe because you need to be punished.

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:25.476
Okay, listen, there's at least
four baby daddies here for you...

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:28.556
...and I just texted three more.
One is a serious krumper.

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:31.592
Yeah, let's just set up a gang bang
and see who sticks.

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:34.252
And Ted, the one from
my cervical cancer commercial...

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.557
...on his way, just turned 40, totally mature.

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:39.099
- I don't want old sperm.
- Sperm's too old. Got it.

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:42.260
Oh, God. This guy, Nick,
won't stop texting me.

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:43.769
- Monster Dick Nick?
- Yeah.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:47.501
We slept together, like, weeks ago,
and now he thinks we're dating.

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:49.008
Yucko.

01:00:49.178 --> 01:00:51.544
You want any wine?
I have a sweet Zinfandel.

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:54.182
Yeah, yes, Zinfandel.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:57.347
- What are you doing?
- Baby-wiping my whole body.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:01.388
Hey, remember you told me
how there's that brain chemical...

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:03.548
...that releases when a woman orgasms?

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:05.318
Oxytocin.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:08.020
I found it. In a pill.

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:10.062
- What?
- Yeah, my friend was telling me...

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:13.896
...he's been taking it recreationally or whatever,
which I thought was weird...

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.801
...because generally dudes can just get off
by looking at their own reflection.

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:21.432
Who's resentful?
But, anyway, I took it tonight.

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:26.074
No. Alice, there is no pill form of oxytocin.

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:28.683
- What you took was OxyContin.
- Yeah, same thing.

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:31.046
No, different thing. Drug-addict thing.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.553
It's like heroin.
It's a really powerful narcotic.

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.214
I have been feeling nauseous...

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:40.351
...but often that's the precursor to my orgasms,
so I was just sort of going with it.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:44.261
Luke and Henry just walked in.
Quick, get me a hot guy to talk to.

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:45.924
What? You invited them?

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:48.866
Oh, damn, Henry. You look tasty.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:51.734
Yeah, this was my party to normalize things.

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.273
Are my boobs even?

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:55.911
You think I'm the drug addict. Eh.

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:58.240
See you on the other side.

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:00.009
Oh.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.349
Alice?

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:05.452
Whoo!

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.091
Hey. I'm so glad you came.

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:14.661
It's cool.

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:18.233
- Are you still mad at me?
- No.

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:22.728
I'm really sorry.

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:24.802
It's all good.

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:28.275
I hope things aren't weird
with you and Luke.

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:31.808
No. I called him.
We sorted it all out. Yeah.

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:33.505
Awesome.

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:39.316
- Oh, I got... I'm gonna be back.
- Yeah.

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.047
Just one sec.

01:02:53.836 --> 01:02:58.170
You see, I learned everything
I know about being a woman...

01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:00.536
<i>...from 90210.</i>

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:03.975
That explains a lot.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.880
In every woman... Henry.

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:08.949
In every woman...

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:13.085
...there's a Brenda...
- Mm-hm.

01:03:13.256 --> 01:03:16.589
...Kelly, my personal favorite...

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:21.224
...a Donna, hopefully minus
the gaping boob-hole...

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:22.887
...and an Andrea.

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:27.024
See, every woman is all of those women.

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:28.295
See?

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:31.440
Well, what about Emily Valentine?

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:44.313
Well, he really sounds like a nice guy.

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:48.415
We've only been out twice,
but he is definitely courting me.

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:51.856
He designs prisons.

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:54.428
- I don't like him.
- Neither do I.

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:57.725
- Well, get rid of him.
- I gotta take what I can get.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.461
Come on. You're Lola.
You can get whoever you want.

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:07.899
- So you and Henry are talking again.
- Yeah.

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:09.977
I mean...

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:12.114
I mean, that was stupid.

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:13.839
I get it.

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:15.574
- Cool.
- Yeah.

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:18.219
I mean, he's been really cool
these last few weeks.

01:04:18.387 --> 01:04:22.380
We've been hanging out.
It's been like old times.

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:26.551
But, you know, his place, it sucks.

01:04:26.762 --> 01:04:29.560
- And my place, it's huge.
- So?

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:34.396
I was thinking, you know,
he might move in with me.

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.869
Or he is. He's moving in with me.

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:45.505
What?

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:49.111
I'm sorry. Is that...? Is that totally weird?

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:50.980
- No.
- Good.

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:54.589
Sounds like a super-fun party house.

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:56.886
<i>Like Real World: Miami.</i>

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:01.419
I'm gonna have some people over.

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:04.327
We're having some people over...

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.991
...and, I mean, I'd love for you to come.

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:10.433
I'll be there.

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:12.130
Great.

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.573
<i>I never wanted this for you.</i>

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.913
I work my whole life, I don't apologize,
to take care of my family.

01:05:24.787 --> 01:05:26.652
And I refused to be a fool...

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:29.347
...dancing on the string
held by all those big shots.

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:34.963
But I thought that, when it was your turn,
that you would be the one to hold the strings.

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:38.362
Well, it wasrt enough time.

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:44.807
But, that being said,
I pledge on the souls of my grandchildren...

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:51.106
...that I will not be the one to break the peace
we have made here today.

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:57.019
Did you just break up with me
as the Godfather?

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:01.885
You know what we should do sometime?

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:05.357
We should get a nice bottle of red
and just do the trilogy.

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:09.396
<i>Lola! It's not even the best Godfather.
That's... Pfft!</i>

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:11.330
Ahh.

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:16.163
What is it you'd like to accomplish today
in your hypnotic trance?

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:19.137
I'd just like to find quiet.

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:21.037
My mind is, like, on crazy overdrive.

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:24.611
I'm constantly obsessing about everything.
Food, boys.

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:28.739
I need to concentrate,
I need to be writing, I can't do it.

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:32.985
Yeah, I just...
I'm unable to be in the moment.

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:35.654
Then that's exactly what we'll work on.

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.520
Close your eyes.

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:42.856
Oh, my God. I'm s...

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:44.999
I'm just turning it off. It's just...

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:48.803
Right now. One second.

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:52.907
Okay. It's off. Okay.

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:55.305
Hey, Alice, it's me.

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:58.709
Listen, I'm really nervous
about going to Luke's party.

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:02.146
I feel like we're gonna be
the only single people there.

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:04.286
Do you think I should get a perm?

01:07:04.453 --> 01:07:07.217
Also not sure if I should
wear something see-through.

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:08.414
Call me.

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:12.560
I feel like I haven't seen you in ages.

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:14.889
I don't know. I've been around.

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:18.500
Well, I called you twice last week
and you didn't call me back.

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.157
Really?

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:21.797
You know what? Um...

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:25.998
One of those nights, I think
I was at a concert, maybe, with Hen.

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:29.167
And then the other one...

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:33.804
I can't remember. My back is so sweaty.
This party's gonna suck. Let's just not go.

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:38.113
No, I can do this. I just saw both of them.
The only difference now is I'm seeing them...

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:41.188
...in the apartment that I thought
I'd raise my children in.

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:44.860
Yeah, you're right.
When you put it that way, it does sound fun.

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:49.730
I don't know if I can be here right now.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:54.393
Does it make me look poor if I don't
eat the white outside part on the Brie?

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:56.101
What's up, Alice?

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:57.864
Oh, hey, what's up?

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.008
Where's Henry?

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:02.337
- He's over there.
- Oh, okay.

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:04.638
I'm gonna go say hi.

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:10.215
- You like the cheese?
- Yep.

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:12.217
So does your shirt.

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:15.824
Mm. Yeah, I'm eating for two.

01:08:16.591 --> 01:08:17.923
What?

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.294
Oh, no. No, me and my shirt.

01:08:20.462 --> 01:08:23.455
I'm eating for my shirt and me.
Sorry, that was such a dumb joke.

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:27.158
- I think I just peed a little, yeah.
- I'm totally not pregnant at all.

01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:30.001
How are you and...?

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.604
- Who?
- Leggy.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.368
Her name is Peggy.

01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:38.206
I know what her name is.
You seem really happy.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.643
Hey, hey, let's go.

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:42.113
I think my TiVo's broken...

01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:46.743
...and I have a very important episode
on the History Channel.

01:08:46.921 --> 01:08:49.823
<i>History of Witches. Do you...?</i>

01:08:49.992 --> 01:08:53.018
Oh, and Peggy says
she needs help with the ice, so...

01:08:53.194 --> 01:08:55.322
Oh, right. You know,
she loves you, by the way.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:56.658
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:08:56.832 --> 01:09:00.893
She loves you? How can she love you
after meeting you one time in a club?

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:05.701
So have you guys been talking?

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:07.740
Yeah, we're talking. That's what people do.

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:10.377
<i>Um, anyway...
Oh, I was watching Chelsea Lately-</i>

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:12.514
- Talking about what?
Oh.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.241
It's nothing. It's nothing important,

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:18.078
Honestly, don't worry about it.
We're not doing this here.

01:09:18.254 --> 01:09:20.017
- Yes, we are.
- No, we're not.

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:21.917
- Yes, we are.
- What is going on?

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:25.992
Uh...

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:31.095
Okay. Lo, we need to talk.

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:33.997
- No.
It's nothing.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:37.139
I mean, it's something,
but it hasn't become anything.

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:39.671
I mean, without me telling you first.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.935
- Fuck, I'm an asshole. Shit, let me start over.
- No!

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:44.272
No, no, no, Lola.

01:09:44.446 --> 01:09:46.310
- Listen to me. Not here, okay?
No!

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:50.542
You could have just talked to me about it!
Then I wouldn't have been ambushed like this!

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:53.051
- I didn't go after this. It was an accident.
- No!

01:09:53.221 --> 01:09:56.282
All you had to do was tell me you had feelings.
We could've talked!

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:57.823
- Whoa, guys.
- Shut up!

01:09:57.993 --> 01:09:59.984
When do I ever have time to tell you things?

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:03.427
- You're wrapped up in your own shit.
Like I don't listen to your shit.

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:07.535
- All that shit with that actor Roger?
- At least I'm aware I'm not alone in this world.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:10.069
I am alone in this world.
You've all left me alone.

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:11.297
I never left you, okay?

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:13.941
I've been beside you
every step of this process.

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:16.577
- The one time I step in front of you...
- I left you.

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:19.279
They didn't leave you. I left you.

01:10:19.748 --> 01:10:21.773
And Alice and I, we make each other calm.

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:25.910
Calm, calm. If you were any more calm,
you would be dead.

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:27.749
Just work on you, okay, Lola?

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:41.267
Hey. Hey, lady.

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:43.098
Lady, there's only $2 here.

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:46.332
Hello. You want to go to jail, lady?
There's only $2 here! I'm talking to you!

01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:50.344
Are you insane? You better get back here.

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.280
Mmm.

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:10.228
Mm.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:15.931
Yeah, ladies! Mm. Mm.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:17.595
Work the pole.

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:21.334
You know, Jessie Spano
was such a good girl, you know?

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:24.035
It's like why did she do it?

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:28.013
Like, the caffeine pills...

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:29.707
Get off the stage, bitch!

01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:33.412
I don't want to go with you.
I like these people. They're my friends.

01:11:33.589 --> 01:11:34.613
No.

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:36.121
Okay.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:38.692
I'm down. I'm all the way down.

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:42.228
Get her out of here.
- I want to go back.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.130
Oh, God.

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:32.212
<i>I wish I could say that
this was someone else's fault.</i>

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:37.709
<i>That it was Luke's fault.</i>

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:44.148
<i>Or Henry's fault, or Alice's.</i>

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:48.029
<i>But it's not.</i>

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:50.794
<i>It's me.</i>

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:10.849
Release your emotions.

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:15.815
Feel the healing power of the platza.

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:17.549
Relax.

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:20.792
You feel good.

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:23.221
Ah!

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:26.596
Huh? That's good.

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:31.796
- A little more. Good.
- Ah!

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:32.289
In his final poem,
Mallarmé writes of shipwreck:

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.993
<i>The man without a vessel</i>

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:37.770
<i>A solitary plume</i>

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:41.432
<i>Overwhelmed
Untouched</i>

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:43.543
With very few words on the page...

01:14:43.712 --> 01:14:49.378
...the writing itself creates space
for silence and pause.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.512
<i>For in this world of shipwreck...</i>

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:58.217
<i>...there is hope in uncertainty.</i>

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.028
Hi, Alice.

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:08.829
It's Lola.

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:12.674
I know that you probably don't
want to see me...

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:17.540
...but I would love to see you.

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:23.480
I'm around, if you want.

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:26.047
Okay.

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:27.945
Bye.

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:38.725
<i>Hey, remember how much
I loved Cinderella as a kid?</i>

01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:42.999
- What a sick fucking kid.
- It's a classic.

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:46.629
It's what messes little girls up,
because we all get obsessed with shoes...

01:15:46.808 --> 01:15:50.369
...and then we think that some guy
is gonna come put them on our feet.

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:54.038
- That is a mars job.
- I actually thought I was living in a fairy tale...

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:58.550
...and that Luke's shoe fit me perfectly.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.656
I guess no shoe is a perfect fit,
especially when you have slightly irregular feet.

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:06.924
Right. Well, you gotta find
your own style, baby.

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:08.960
Are you telling me to go shoe shopping?

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:10.928
I have a friend, Diane...

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:13.897
No, she has an eight-and-a-half
and a nine-and-a-half.

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.094
That's not even close. That's a whole size.

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:17.932
- That's depressing, Mom.
- No, I know.

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:21.940
It's scary to think that one side could grow
and the other side doesn't.

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:24.874
- It's disgusting.
- Imagine her bras.

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:29.344
I got you something.

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:32.214
Oh, my God, you shouldn't have.

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:33.814
It's a douche.

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.922
I know you've been wanting a new one.

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:38.616
- I'm douchey.
- I'm douchey.

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:42.924
- Eh.
- I'm so sorry about how I acted.

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:45.589
I'm sorry too.
I should have told you sooner.

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.962
- I was so stupid.
- Don't... Don't be sorry.

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:51.867
I am so happy for you and Henry.

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.871
Really.

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:55.509
I love you.

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:58.370
I love you.

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:01.277
Oh. Ahem.

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:05.682
So I want to have a party for my birthday
and I need your help.

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:07.344
- Is this a trick?
- No.

01:17:07.522 --> 01:17:11.856
I know I have never had a birthday party before,
but I think I'm ready.

01:17:12.027 --> 01:17:14.086
Okay. Yeah, I'm loving it.

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:16.457
Let's... What are we doing?
Going to Six Flags?

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:20.534
No, I just think I need a clean start...

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:25.401
...because I've really fucked up
all my friendships over the past year.

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:26.939
- So...
- No.

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:28.576
It's like everyone always says:

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:31.542
To love someone else,
you have to learn how to love yourself.

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:35.410
But I don't know, after this year,
I don't think that's true.

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:40.351
I think to love yourself,
you have to learn how to love other people.

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:48.355
Illuminati.
The Illuminati.

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:51.055
And they say that Hillary Clinton is a lizard.

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:56.432
The thing is, if you look at the sky enough,
you will see lasers shooting out of the moon.

01:17:56.605 --> 01:18:00.473
If you really, really look,
because I have seen it.

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:04.271
It was on YouTube, but I did see it
with my eyes through a computer.

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:06.880
- It's because the apocalypse is coming.
- I know.

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:10.041
- I'm moving to Canada.
- I'm just gonna try to keep to my routine.

01:18:10.218 --> 01:18:12.243
All right, I'm getting pizza.

01:18:12.421 --> 01:18:13.547
Oh, my God.

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:14.746
- Hey!
You came!

01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:16.254
I'm so happy you came!

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:18.655
You never have a birthday party.

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:23.389
I'm having a bit of a rebirth,
so I thought it was cause for celebration.

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:26.393
- About the whole Alice thing...
- No.

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:28.297
- It's so fine.
- Really?

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:29.903
We don't hold grudges.

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:33.572
Well, I am actually still upset
that you lost my Boyz II Men cassette.

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:37.173
Oh, I don't speak Spanish.

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:39.210
- Ugh.
- Ugh. Come on.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:41.940
Mm.

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:44.175
Missed you.

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:51.987
- Did you know he was coming?
- No.

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:55.187
I'm gonna get some nibblers.

01:18:59.634 --> 01:19:00.658
Hey.

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:07.333
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't miss this.

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:10.635
It's just kind of a picnic.

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:14.675
Yeah, well, I didn't want to miss this...

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:17.250
...because I miss this.

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:19.785
- Are you speaking in rhyming verse now?
- Yes.

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:21.752
Because I'm nervous. Uh...

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:25.221
Look, I just gotta say this. Um...

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:27.793
I mean, I got my space.

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:31.626
- I just ended up in another relationship.
- Right.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.427
But it's fleeting.

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:35.397
And it's not real.

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:38.164
And I just think I needed some distance
to realize that.

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:42.205
- Was that all you needed?
- Yeah.

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:45.278
I mean, now we can go at this
from a totally new way.

01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:48.943
I don't know what to say.

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:54.445
You didn't want me or us or any of it.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:58.559
And then you got this distance.

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:02.726
But the thing is, I haven't, really.

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:04.866
What do you mean?
I mean, you've had time.

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:07.001
It's been months.

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:10.138
But I spent all that time obsessing over you.

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:11.863
And other people.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:16.977
And I think I finally have some
perspective on what I need.

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:21.346
- Which is?
- Which is...

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:25.714
I'm so touched that you want to start
all of this back up again...

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:29.653
...but I'm taken. Heh.

01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:34.628
By myself. I...

01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:38.523
I've just got to do me for a while.

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:45.172
Lola!

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.137
I'm coming!

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:55.105
Okay, yeah. Come on.
Let's go, folks. Fire up this pastry.

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:56.614
Here we go, here we go.

01:20:56.785 --> 01:20:59.049
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay.

01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:00.313
All right.

01:21:00.488 --> 01:21:01.921
Birthday rap!

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:03.580
- Get ready.
- Okay.

01:21:03.758 --> 01:21:05.817
<i>You're 6, you're Lola</i>

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:07.757
<i>You live in Angola</i>

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:09.624
<i>You're African, except you're not</i>

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:11.789
<i>But you're just as hot</i>

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:15.232
<i>You're a writer, you're a fighter
Like a Mark Wahlberg fighter</i>

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:17.200
<i>- Except you're Donnie
- I'm your mommy</i>

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:19.203
<i>And I'm your friend who's black</i>

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:21.638
This is not what we rehearsed.
Happy birthday!

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.778
Happy birthday!

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:32.483
All right, let's eat cake.

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:37.416
Thank you.

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:42.656
Ooh!

01:22:00.982 --> 01:22:04.315
<i>I have 29 years before the next upheaval.</i>

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:09.890
<i>Before that crazy planet comes back
to wreak havoc on my life.</i>

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:11.787
<i>And when it's over...</i>

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:17.762
<i>...I hope I feel exactly the way I do right now.</i>
