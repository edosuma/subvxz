01:18.545 --> 01:23.749
Omnes in infernis arderet.
Ipsum non protest salvum.

01:23.751 --> 01:24.817
Strap her down!

01:33.760 --> 01:35.861
Lay the salt line
round the table.

01:35.863 --> 01:38.597
We cannot let it escape.

01:40.867 --> 01:44.136
In the name of the father, son,
and holy spirit,

01:44.138 --> 01:47.639
I call upon nefas.
Heed my words.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.575
Non ùlta áudeas,

01:49.577 --> 01:51.743
sérpens callidíssime,

01:51.745 --> 01:54.446
decípere humánum génus.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.349
Dei ecclésiam pérsequi,

01:57.351 --> 02:03.455
dei eléctos excútere
et cribráre sicut tríticum!

02:24.477 --> 02:28.213
Oh, my god.
What have we done?

05:18.484 --> 05:20.352
I am so sorry.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.587
I didn't realize the truck
was turning at the last minute.

05:22.589 --> 05:25.057
- Jeremy, are you all right?
- Never better.

05:25.059 --> 05:26.925
- Are you sure?
- Way to go, mom.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.528
Haven't even moved in yet,
and you almost killed someone.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.698
And on that note, this is
my lovely daughter Charlotte,

05:32.700 --> 05:34.366
and I'm Julia Larsen,

05:34.368 --> 05:36.968
and I swear
i am a good driver,

05:36.970 --> 05:39.571
but only in Chicago traffic.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.341
Hi, I'm father Donald,

05:42.343 --> 05:44.910
and this is
Dr. Jeremy Miller.

05:44.912 --> 05:48.513
So, doctor,
if you got hurt,

05:48.515 --> 05:50.816
you could've
patched yourself up.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.551
Please, just call me Jeremy.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.688
Uh, mom?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.623
Oh, yeah.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.059
We should catch up
to the truck.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.894
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yes.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.896
Well, welcome to crestwick.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.065
Say, if you want to join us
for service tomorrow morning,

06:07.067 --> 06:09.601
I can introduce you
to some of your new neighbors.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.403
That would be lovely.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.572
Thank you, father.
We just might.

06:27.787 --> 06:30.922
There's something
i haven't seen in a while.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.657
A car?

06:32.659 --> 06:34.659
A lingering eye.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.730
We've missed you on Sundays.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.033
It's been three years, father.
Maybe you'll get used to it.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.102
Jeremy, I know that sometimes
your line of work

06:44.104 --> 06:47.005
constitutes playing god.

06:47.007 --> 06:50.876
That doesn't mean you do it
as well as he does.

06:50.878 --> 06:55.046
He's done a real swell job
so far, remember?

06:57.784 --> 06:59.985
I'm here every Sunday!

07:02.021 --> 07:04.456
He's cute.
You should go for him.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.726
Don't be silly. We just met.
I'm not ready.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.561
Dad left 10 years ago.

07:09.563 --> 07:12.197
I meant we haven't even
unpacked yet.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.529
Hey, guys.
Sorry we lost you.

07:44.531 --> 07:45.764
No worries.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.704
Shall we walk over
the threshold together?

07:52.706 --> 07:53.972
Sure.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.552
Here it is. All ours.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.554
Great, mom.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.690
College will be here
before you know it.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.025
What am I suppose to do
till then?

08:14.027 --> 08:16.194
Something will come up.

08:16.196 --> 08:19.564
Seriously?
This is the best we could do?

08:19.566 --> 08:22.868
Wait till you see your room.
First door on the right.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.005
Hey, guys, you can bring
that stuff in here.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.215
Eww, gross.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.571
Mom!

09:32.573 --> 09:34.005
Yeah?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.273
- Sorry.
- Mom!

09:36.275 --> 09:38.009
What's this?

09:38.011 --> 09:40.812
It was in the closet.

09:40.814 --> 09:44.316
Too bad it's not my style.
What else is in there?

09:44.318 --> 09:46.318
Just this old painting.

09:48.354 --> 09:51.156
Ooh. This is our house.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.098
Does that look centered?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.633
Yeah, I guess.

10:45.244 --> 10:47.779
It's okay.

10:47.781 --> 10:51.683
It's okay.
Just a dream.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.653
We have to hurry.
Church starts in 40 minutes.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.254
Church?

10:56.256 --> 10:58.056
Come on!
We just moved in.

10:58.058 --> 11:01.760
I don't have to go every Sunday,
but today is important.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.061
We can meet some people.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.931
Just to be sure,

11:06.933 --> 11:08.933
there's no way
i can get out of going?

11:08.935 --> 11:12.771
Father Donald was so kind
to invite us. We're going.

11:12.773 --> 11:16.941
Uh-huh, right.
That's why we're going.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.810
So hurry up.

11:29.422 --> 11:32.791
Look at you,
looking all sharp.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.192
Hello. I was hoping
you'd make it.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.360
Of course.
It's good to see you again.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.095
- Hi, father.
- Hello.

11:37.097 --> 11:41.132
I've already started repenting
for my lead foot.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.468
Speaking of which,
will Dr. Miller be here today?

11:43.470 --> 11:46.204
No. I'm afraid Jeremy hasn't
been to a service in a while.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.939
I think he feels a little weird
coming to a church

11:47.941 --> 11:49.374
where he's seen half
of our congregation

11:49.376 --> 11:51.209
in their underclothes.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.844
Or less.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.780
Wish they mentioned that
yesterday.

11:55.782 --> 11:59.484
Um, his office is
right around the corner though.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.052
Thank you, father.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.887
Listen, I'm sorry.
I have to get ready.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.756
But make sure
you stick around afterwards

12:04.758 --> 12:06.991
'cause there's people
i want to introduce you to.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.460
Of course.

12:32.017 --> 12:36.087
The lord be with you.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.022
May almighty god bless you.

12:38.024 --> 12:41.493
The father, the son,
and the holy spirit.

12:41.495 --> 12:43.128
Amen.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.164
Go in peace to love
and serve the lord.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.933
Praise be to god.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.369
Thank you.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.037
Have a good day.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.238
- Bye
- bye-bye.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.107
Father, that was
such a wonderful sermon.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.475
Thank you very much.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.510
You've been
such a great comfort to us

13:32.512 --> 13:34.045
since we've moved to town.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.347
You too.
Julia, Charlotte!

13:36.349 --> 13:39.117
I'm sorry. I wanted to introduce
you to Priscilla birchman.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.451
- Hello.
- Hi.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.953
Priscilla and her husband

13:41.955 --> 13:44.122
just moved here as well,
three months ago.

13:44.124 --> 13:47.091
They're looking for a sitter
for their son drew,

13:47.093 --> 13:50.595
so I immediately thought of you,
Charlotte.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.131
Would you be available
on Wednesday?

13:53.133 --> 13:56.034
This Wednesday?
Yeah, I'm totally free.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.069
Praise the lord.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.405
We're having some work done
on the house,

14:00.407 --> 14:03.474
including converting one of our
bedrooms to a worship room,

14:03.476 --> 14:06.044
like I mentioned before.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.447
Do you mind if I bring drew
over to you?

14:09.449 --> 14:12.483
Not at all.
Easier for me.

14:12.485 --> 14:16.187
Our address is
666 east mulberry.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.891
No. No, no, no.
It's 966 east mulberry road,

14:19.893 --> 14:21.492
right on the edge of town.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.161
Oh, great.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.997
I'm sorry. Would you excuse me
just one second?

14:25.999 --> 14:27.999
I will be right back.

14:30.603 --> 14:34.272
Okay, then. We'll see you
at 6:00 on Wednesday.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.373
Sounds great.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.108
Look at that.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.110
Here one day, you already
have a babysitting gig.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.946
I know.
I wonder what they pay here?

14:41.948 --> 14:44.249
If you're lucky,
she'll pay you in chickens.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.984
Here we are.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.219
A little "welcome to
the congregation" gift.

14:48.221 --> 14:51.089
Aww. Saint Christopher.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.458
Who do we need
protection from?

14:53.460 --> 14:55.994
Well, I usually give out
virgin Marys,

14:55.996 --> 14:57.962
but I just ran out,
I'm afraid.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.998
Well, it's beautiful, father.
Thank you.

15:41.473 --> 15:43.107
Charlotte?

15:51.083 --> 15:52.417
Charlotte?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.558
Charlotte?

16:03.195 --> 16:04.662
Charlotte, what are you doing...

16:04.664 --> 16:06.664
did you call?

16:06.666 --> 16:09.400
I thought I heard something.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.635
Don't sneak up on me.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.670
Sorry. Guess we're even now.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.606
I'm gonna start the movie.
You almost done?

16:15.608 --> 16:17.241
Yeah. Let me just say bye
to Jessie.

16:17.243 --> 16:19.077
Tell her hi.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.524
<i>What's that around your neck?</i>

16:33.526 --> 16:35.293
Oh, nothing.

16:35.295 --> 16:38.529
<i>- It looks so ugly.
- I know, right?</i>

16:41.066 --> 16:42.734
Hey, I gotta go.
Movie night with mom.

16:42.736 --> 16:44.602
I'll catch you online
tomorrow, okay?

16:44.604 --> 16:46.571
<i>Okay. Tell her hi.</i>

16:52.244 --> 16:55.346
- Ooh. What's that?
- What?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.749
That's weird.
I didn't notice it before.

16:57.751 --> 17:00.284
Looks like a little allergy.

17:02.321 --> 17:05.623
Okay.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.192
What's going on?

17:08.194 --> 17:11.329
That's what you get
for buying an old crappy house.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.633
If you had gotten
a full scholarship,

17:15.635 --> 17:19.069
- I could've got a nicer house
- yeah, yeah.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.608
You're still my favorite mom.

17:25.477 --> 17:27.244
- You want some?
- Yes.

17:50.169 --> 17:52.336
Charlotte.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.480
Mom!

18:06.218 --> 18:09.387
- Thank you, doctor.
- And stay off that golf course.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.089
I'll play some chess.

18:15.794 --> 18:17.628
Uh, Muriel,

18:17.630 --> 18:22.500
bring Mr. Coleman back for
a follow-up exam in two weeks.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.502
Off to your
granddaughter's recital?

18:24.504 --> 18:26.370
And I'm barely gonna make it.

18:26.372 --> 18:27.872
You have a new patient
in room one.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.440
Last appointment of the day.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.110
Oh, and, Jeremy,
her mom is real cute.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.778
I'm sure she is.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.585
The larsens.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.724
I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.527
Neither did we.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.530
Well, what seems to be
the problem?

18:58.237 --> 18:59.804
Interesting.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.539
Am I gonna make it?

19:01.541 --> 19:03.541
Well, it's a good thing
you came in when you did.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.409
Is it serious?

19:05.411 --> 19:08.446
Let's just say that
if you'd waited any longer,

19:08.448 --> 19:10.815
we probably would have
to remove the skin

19:10.817 --> 19:13.284
what? From a rash?

19:17.823 --> 19:20.258
Just let me see where we keep
the antibiotic creams.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.759
I'll be right back

19:25.597 --> 19:27.798
- so...
- What?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.400
I see how you look at him.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.202
We are here
because of your rash.

19:31.204 --> 19:34.172
- You insisted on Dr. Miller.
- We've already met him.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.873
It would be silly
to go to somebody else.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.542
Uh-huh

19:38.745 --> 19:39.944
got it.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.549
I should take this.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.788
It was my joke, right?
Bad joke.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.858
I enjoyed it.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.961
- Uh, is this the cream?
- This is it.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.197
You're all set.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.899
Just let me know
if it gets any worse.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.234
Okay.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.739
I guess I should
get going then.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.841
Right.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.843
It was really good seeing you.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.245
Likewise.

20:15.614 --> 20:18.382
How'd the groceries
work out?

20:18.384 --> 20:20.952
- Well. Uh, yours?
- Oh, great.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.720
Let's just say I don't want
to make a habit of cooking.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.923
Right. So what's
on the menu tonight?

20:25.925 --> 20:29.393
Tonight, Monday?
Monday is pizza night.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.862
I have been known
to eat a large,

20:31.864 --> 20:33.698
all by myself,
in one sitting.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.933
Not very often because
that is totally unhealthy.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.768
That must be quite a sight.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.404
You and Charlotte
should try monical's.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.872
It's the best pizza in town.

20:41.874 --> 20:44.942
We should probably go
with someone who knows

20:44.944 --> 20:46.844
what to order then.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.646
I'd love to take you, but...

20:48.648 --> 20:50.681
I don't usually fraternize
with patients.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.351
No, no.
That's just Charlotte.

20:53.353 --> 20:58.322
I go to Dr. so-and-so
on the other side of town.

20:58.324 --> 21:00.558
Not now 'cause I'm
totally fine, but...

21:00.560 --> 21:03.361
But seriously,
you can't go wrong

21:03.363 --> 21:06.664
with anything on the menu.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.567
Okay, well, I guess
I'll have to risk it myself.

21:09.569 --> 21:12.737
Okay.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.338
Bye.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.951
What's going on?

21:26.953 --> 21:28.486
Nothing.

21:39.398 --> 21:40.798
Mom!

21:40.800 --> 21:42.033
Yeah?

21:42.035 --> 21:44.001
There's literally
nothing to eat.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.737
I just got groceries.
I'm sure there's something.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.873
- I want pizza.
- Pizza?

21:50.776 --> 21:52.376
Pizza!

21:52.378 --> 21:54.879
- Why are you so excited?
- No, no, nothing.

21:54.881 --> 21:59.083
I'll go get us a pizza.
I heard about a great place.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.685
Okay.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.430
Welcome. Dining in?

22:12.432 --> 22:13.798
Carry out, actually.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.399
What can I get for you?

22:15.401 --> 22:16.734
One large pepperoni pizza.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.602
- Will that be all?
- Yes.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.371
If you'd like to take a seat,
that'll be right up.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.588
Hey.

22:37.590 --> 22:40.591
This place is hopping
for a Monday night.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.793
I told you.
Best in town.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.595
It's the only in town.

22:44.597 --> 22:47.365
Much different than Chicago.

22:47.367 --> 22:50.801
Do you mind if I sit here
while I wait?

22:50.803 --> 22:53.671
Sure.

22:53.673 --> 22:57.742
Um, so what are your thoughts
on crestwick?

22:57.744 --> 23:00.578
Um...

23:00.580 --> 23:03.881
I think it was
the change I needed.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.816
It's so overwhelming.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.885
I wanna try to have
at least one day off.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.553
<i>I'm sure you can.</i>

23:09.555 --> 23:11.389
<i>That's what's great
about college.</i>

23:11.391 --> 23:13.824
It's gonna be so awesome
being out on our own.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.960
<i>I'm so ready for this.</i>

23:15.962 --> 23:17.995
What the...

23:17.997 --> 23:21.098
what is going on
in this house?

23:21.100 --> 23:23.033
<i>At least the Internet...</i>

23:24.436 --> 23:26.904
well, this isn't creepy
at all.

23:28.974 --> 23:31.008
Okay.

23:38.850 --> 23:39.884
Great.

24:22.861 --> 24:25.162
<i>Wtf, girl? I thought you
were dead or something.</i>

24:25.164 --> 24:28.732
Dramatic. My Internet
just came back up.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.134
<i>Hi, Ms. Larsen.</i>

24:32.504 --> 24:34.538
Who are you talking to?

24:34.540 --> 24:37.241
I totally thought
i saw your mom.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.243
My mom's not even home.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.545
She's probably out
stalking Dr. Miller.

24:41.547 --> 24:45.249
But I swear.
Anyways, who's Dr. Miller?

24:45.251 --> 24:47.885
The really cute town doctor.

24:50.689 --> 24:52.189
Do you hear that?

24:52.191 --> 24:55.526
<i>- What?
- Let me call you back.</i>

25:11.643 --> 25:13.177
Come on.
Pick up, mom.

25:17.883 --> 25:20.217
I actually...

25:20.219 --> 25:22.653
I actually have one better.

25:22.655 --> 25:25.923
Yeah. Let me get a little bit
more of that first.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.025
<i>Hi, this is Julia.
Leave a message.</i>

25:29.195 --> 25:31.028
Mom, did you feel
that earthquake?

25:31.030 --> 25:34.832
I'm seriously freaked out.
Call me back when you get this.

25:53.585 --> 25:56.320
Mom, seriously, where are you?

26:04.763 --> 26:06.196
<i>The quality of the soil
underneath</i>

26:06.198 --> 26:08.899
<i>is actually more important
than how you...</i>

26:08.901 --> 26:11.902
Only in this town would a garden
trump an earthquake.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.648
Mom?

26:32.958 --> 26:34.992
Mom, is that you?

26:53.745 --> 26:56.747
Seriously, this isn't funny!

27:06.691 --> 27:08.759
I really better go.

27:08.761 --> 27:11.695
Charlotte's gonna kill me
for taking so long.

27:11.697 --> 27:14.932
The good thing is this pizza's
great even when it's cold.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.734
I love cold pizza.

27:16.736 --> 27:19.036
So do I.

27:19.038 --> 27:21.872
Well, hopefully we can try
that famous stir-fry

27:21.874 --> 27:23.407
you've been talking about.

27:23.409 --> 27:26.243
I'm not actually sure
i remember how to make it.

27:26.245 --> 27:30.014
Hopefully it comes to you.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.316
Thanks again for letting me
ruin your dinner.

27:59.978 --> 28:01.979
<i>Mom, did you feel
that earthquake?</i>

28:01.981 --> 28:04.014
<i>- I'm seriously freaked out.
- Earthquake?</i>

28:04.016 --> 28:06.083
<i>Call me back
when you get this.</i>

28:11.723 --> 28:12.990
Charlotte?

28:15.226 --> 28:16.293
Hon?

28:16.295 --> 28:18.362
Charlotte?

28:23.735 --> 28:27.371
I'm so sorry. I didn't
get your message till now.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.773
What is this about
an earthquake?

28:29.775 --> 28:31.809
Oh.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.210
Uh, nothing.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.978
Don't worry about it.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.380
Don't worry about it?

28:45.023 --> 28:46.490
Come on. Let's eat.

28:46.492 --> 28:49.126
I'm not hungry anymore.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.427
Fine.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.996
It'll be downstairs
if you want it.

30:33.464 --> 30:35.532
It won't help.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.035
She's burning up.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.504
I have to get the fever down.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.072
You have to get her
back to the hospital.

30:42.074 --> 30:45.909
Shh! It can hear you.

31:00.425 --> 31:03.260
The hospital
is not what she needs.

31:03.262 --> 31:05.429
You are clueless
as to what she needs.

31:05.431 --> 31:08.599
This is absurd. Let me do my job
and everything will be...

31:08.601 --> 31:11.902
I have seen it! There is
something in this house,

31:11.904 --> 31:15.873
and it has taken over
my baby's body.

31:15.875 --> 31:19.576
Olivia, I'm telling you,

31:19.578 --> 31:21.612
get her back
to the hospital...

31:21.614 --> 31:24.982
you are too proud with
your precious medical degree,

31:24.984 --> 31:28.485
your fancy medicines,
and your blown up freaking ego

31:28.487 --> 31:31.054
to admit that
this is beyond you!

31:31.056 --> 31:33.257
Get out of my house!

31:38.563 --> 31:41.231
- Father Donald.
- I'm here for maddie.

31:41.233 --> 31:44.601
Father, you don't actually
believe this crap, do you?

31:44.603 --> 31:48.972
Listen to me. Maddie is showing
the classic signs of possession.

31:48.974 --> 31:50.173
Demonic possession.

31:50.175 --> 31:52.376
Listen, this has
happened before.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.511
It's the house, Jeremy.
It has to be.

31:54.513 --> 31:57.447
You are just as crazy as Olivia.
No wonder she's this way.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.483
You keep feeding her
this nonsense.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.985
I'm not gonna let maddie
pay for it.

32:36.254 --> 32:38.322
Charlotte, breakfast.

32:48.399 --> 32:50.267
Charlotte?

32:55.673 --> 33:00.010
Charlotte, breakfast is ready.
Hurry up before it gets cold.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.638
Where are you going?

33:28.640 --> 33:31.475
Uh, to school.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.543
The teachers
have a meeting today.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.212
Oh.

33:39.183 --> 33:42.386
Did you hear me say
breakfast was downstairs?

33:48.026 --> 33:49.126
Charlotte!

33:53.331 --> 33:54.631
Jesus!

33:54.633 --> 33:56.199
Will you stop doing that?

33:56.201 --> 33:58.168
What?

33:58.170 --> 34:01.238
What is this?

34:01.240 --> 34:04.041
What has gotten into you?

34:04.043 --> 34:05.809
I didn't do it.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.447
Clean this up.
I'm gonna be late.

34:10.449 --> 34:14.251
Don't forget you're
babysitting drew tonight.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.076
Hello?

34:39.078 --> 34:41.078
You're not gonna believe this,

34:41.080 --> 34:44.281
but I just bought this bag
of fresh vegetables to stir-fry,

34:44.283 --> 34:47.417
and I realized that I just
bought too many of them.

34:47.418 --> 34:51.254
Oh, no. That's no good.
It's not good to waste

34:51.255 --> 34:53.790
would you like to come over
and help me cook

34:53.792 --> 34:56.860
<i>and get rid of them?</i>

34:56.862 --> 34:58.328
I might.

34:58.330 --> 35:01.398
So does that mean
you'll, uh...

35:01.400 --> 35:02.532
You'll join me?

35:02.534 --> 35:04.468
What time?

35:04.470 --> 35:08.205
Uh, well, I'm just about to
start to get ready to cook.

35:08.207 --> 35:09.806
Would you like
to come over and help?

35:09.808 --> 35:14.845
Yeah. I'm free, actually.
I could come over now.

35:14.847 --> 35:19.549
Great. I'll, uh,
see you when you get here.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.518
<i>Okay. See you soon.</i>

35:24.122 --> 35:25.856
<i>You've reached Charlotte.
Lucky you.</i>

35:25.858 --> 35:28.158
<i>Leave me a message,
and I'll get back to you.</i>

35:28.160 --> 35:31.161
Hey, honey, I just want to let
you know that I finished school,

35:31.163 --> 35:33.363
but I won't be home right away.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.699
Spontaneous dinner
with Dr. Miller.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.434
Yesterday's pizza
is in the fridge.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.569
I will see you soon.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.247
<i>Just want to let you
know that I finished school,</i>

35:50.249 --> 35:51.815
<i>but I won't be home right away.</i>

35:51.817 --> 35:54.684
<i>Spontaneous dinner
with Dr. Miller.</i>

35:54.686 --> 35:56.286
<i>Yesterday's pizza...</i>

36:21.412 --> 36:23.413
Mommy won't be gone
that long, honey.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.448
I don't wanna go.

36:25.450 --> 36:27.551
Oh, baby.

36:27.553 --> 36:30.520
Mommy hates to leave
her big boy here,

36:30.522 --> 36:33.757
but I'll be back soon,
i promise.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.197
Hi.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.932
Hi, Charlotte.

36:41.934 --> 36:44.668
- Drew say hi.
- Hi

36:44.670 --> 36:46.469
come on in.

36:48.306 --> 36:50.540
I have to get going because
I'm running a little late,

36:50.542 --> 36:53.710
but I'll be back
in less than two hours.

36:53.712 --> 36:57.614
Mommy will see you soon.
Have fun with Charlotte.

37:21.505 --> 37:23.907
Wanna play hide and seek?

37:25.443 --> 37:28.645
This is a really nice place.

37:28.647 --> 37:30.714
How long have you been here?

37:30.716 --> 37:33.016
I've been here
a couple of years,

37:33.018 --> 37:37.020
but it's been a while
since I've had any guests.

37:37.022 --> 37:40.757
Well, then, I'm happy
that you called me.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.726
I have to be honest.

37:42.728 --> 37:47.530
I have not been
on a date in...

37:47.532 --> 37:48.965
Forever.

37:50.002 --> 37:51.701
What about monical's?

37:51.703 --> 37:54.904
Oh, well, at least this time,
i was actually invited.

37:56.374 --> 37:59.476
One, two, three,

37:59.478 --> 38:06.850
four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine...

38:06.852 --> 38:08.618
<i>Ten.</i>

41:00.558 --> 41:01.791
Gotcha.

41:14.905 --> 41:17.740
That was really good.

41:17.742 --> 41:21.177
Well, let's wrap some up
for Charlotte.

41:21.179 --> 41:23.780
She would like that.

41:23.782 --> 41:26.182
How's the rash?
Is everything okay?

41:27.751 --> 41:29.786
Yeah. Yeah, I think.

41:29.788 --> 41:32.188
That didn't sound
very convincing.

41:34.658 --> 41:36.860
She didn't say anything
about the rash.

41:36.862 --> 41:39.162
Just wasn't
quite herself today.

41:39.164 --> 41:42.031
No? Is everything all right?

41:42.033 --> 41:43.566
It's just strange, you know?

41:43.568 --> 41:47.103
I can't quite
put my finger on it.

41:47.105 --> 41:49.706
Just...

41:49.708 --> 41:52.575
Seemed like distant,
sort of like a different person.

41:54.712 --> 41:56.913
I don't know. I think
I'm just exhausted with the move

41:56.915 --> 41:58.915
and the new job
and everything.

41:58.917 --> 42:02.252
Well, I wouldn't stress about it
too much.

42:02.254 --> 42:04.554
A move can be pretty tough
on a teenager.

42:04.556 --> 42:06.789
Yeah.

42:06.791 --> 42:08.992
She'll be moving again soon.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.159
Where to?

42:10.161 --> 42:13.796
College.
Starts in a few weeks.

42:13.798 --> 42:15.164
College.

42:15.166 --> 42:18.134
That's definitely it.

42:18.136 --> 42:20.303
She probably just misses
her old friends

42:20.305 --> 42:22.872
and is nervous about making
new ones at school.

42:22.874 --> 42:26.309
You know how teenagers
can be.

42:28.579 --> 42:30.113
Well...

42:30.115 --> 42:32.015
- Let me help you with this.
- No, no.

42:32.017 --> 42:33.616
Why don't you just wait
in the living room,

42:33.618 --> 42:35.618
and I'll be right there.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.860
Just so you know,

42:43.862 --> 42:46.162
I might have gotten
some ice cream for desert.

42:46.164 --> 42:49.132
Ooh, I will take it.

43:04.315 --> 43:05.715
She's adorable.

43:11.021 --> 43:13.856
Is that my house?

43:17.962 --> 43:19.596
Yes, it is.

43:19.598 --> 43:21.598
This is maddie.

43:24.068 --> 43:26.736
She was a very special patient.

43:26.738 --> 43:31.641
She fell ill and, um...

43:31.643 --> 43:33.810
I just couldn't save her.

43:33.812 --> 43:36.846
I'm so sorry.

43:36.848 --> 43:38.815
What happened?

43:41.318 --> 43:43.987
I still ask myself
that question every day.

43:46.924 --> 43:48.758
It must've been really hard.

43:53.364 --> 43:57.033
You know, sometimes it's just
out of our hands, you know?

43:58.035 --> 44:00.136
Yeah.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.038
Here.

44:03.140 --> 44:05.141
Please.

44:05.143 --> 44:07.276
Looks delicious.

44:07.278 --> 44:08.778
Glad you like it.

44:20.724 --> 44:22.058
Charlotte?

44:22.060 --> 44:25.828
It's Priscilla.
I'm back.

44:42.413 --> 44:46.382
Drew, it's time to go.

44:46.384 --> 44:49.318
Charlotte, where are you?

44:49.320 --> 44:52.088
She's no longer here.

44:52.090 --> 44:54.991
Good lord, you scared me!

44:54.993 --> 44:57.727
Why is it so dark in here?

44:57.729 --> 44:59.696
We were playing
hide and seek.

45:03.167 --> 45:05.968
Drew, let's go!

45:05.970 --> 45:07.236
Mommy's here.

45:09.473 --> 45:11.774
Where is he?
I need to go.

45:11.776 --> 45:13.743
I'm not sure.

45:13.745 --> 45:16.112
I think he could be upstairs.

45:16.114 --> 45:18.114
You're gonna have to find him.

45:18.116 --> 45:21.117
I'm not playing hide and seek.

45:21.119 --> 45:22.919
Now tell me where he is.

45:32.763 --> 45:34.397
Charlotte?

45:38.469 --> 45:39.802
Drew?

45:43.874 --> 45:45.475
Drew?

45:45.477 --> 45:47.210
Are you in there?

45:50.481 --> 45:53.382
Drew, it's mommy.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.225
Drew?

46:02.227 --> 46:03.760
Is that you?

46:06.463 --> 46:10.299
Charlotte, I wanna know
right now where drew is.

46:10.301 --> 46:12.401
I told you.

46:12.403 --> 46:15.471
<i>Charlotte
is no longer here!</i>

46:17.442 --> 46:20.910
Lord, protect my son.

46:20.912 --> 46:26.983
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the lord is with you.

46:26.985 --> 46:30.052
<i>But the lord
is not with you.</i>

46:30.054 --> 46:31.154
<i>I am!</i>

46:35.859 --> 46:39.328
May god have mercy
on your soul.

46:39.330 --> 46:41.564
<i>May Lucifer have mercy
on yours.</i>

46:41.566 --> 46:43.065
Ohh!

47:27.444 --> 47:28.477
Hello.

47:32.182 --> 47:34.050
Hi.

47:34.052 --> 47:36.552
What are you doing?

47:36.554 --> 47:38.454
Nothing.

47:39.957 --> 47:41.290
How was babysitting?

47:41.292 --> 47:44.026
Glad its over.

47:44.028 --> 47:45.561
Why?

47:45.563 --> 47:47.396
Because Priscilla is a bitch.

47:47.398 --> 47:49.966
Charlotte!

47:49.968 --> 47:51.868
How was your date?

47:51.870 --> 47:53.569
It wasn't really a...

47:53.571 --> 47:57.039
don't lie to me!

47:57.041 --> 48:00.142
Who do you think you're talking
to like that, young lady?

48:00.144 --> 48:01.644
What has gotten into you?

48:01.646 --> 48:06.315
First you call Priscilla
a bitch, then you question me?

48:06.317 --> 48:08.484
Whatever it is,
i don't like it.

48:08.486 --> 48:12.555
Good, because
i don't like you either.

48:43.987 --> 48:46.022
Yes?

48:46.024 --> 48:49.158
Yes, ma'am. I'm officer Reilly.
Could I have a few moments?

48:49.160 --> 48:52.028
Sure. What is this about?

48:52.030 --> 48:53.429
I'm checking the whereabouts

48:53.431 --> 48:55.364
of Priscilla birchman
and her son drew.

48:55.366 --> 48:58.935
- What happened?
- We're not sure.

48:58.937 --> 49:01.404
No one's seen them since she
left the youth group last night.

49:01.406 --> 49:03.539
She was headed here
to pick up drew.

49:03.541 --> 49:04.941
Please, come on in.

49:10.314 --> 49:12.014
Can I speak with Charlotte?

49:12.016 --> 49:14.116
She may be the best help,
since she babysat drew.

49:14.118 --> 49:15.451
Yeah, absolutely.

49:15.453 --> 49:17.353
Charlotte.

49:17.355 --> 49:19.355
This is officer Reilly.

49:19.357 --> 49:22.692
He's here because Priscilla
and drew are missing.

49:22.694 --> 49:24.627
Tell me about last night.

49:24.629 --> 49:26.662
I was told that you
babysat drew.

49:26.664 --> 49:30.466
Priscilla dropped him off
at about seven.

49:30.468 --> 49:33.536
We watched TV,

49:33.538 --> 49:36.172
played hide and seek,

49:36.174 --> 49:39.041
and then she came back.

49:39.043 --> 49:40.576
It was about 9:30.

49:40.578 --> 49:43.612
Was there anything odd
about her demeanor?

49:43.614 --> 49:49.352
No. She stayed for a bit
and played hide and seek.

49:52.189 --> 49:54.323
What time she leave?

49:54.325 --> 49:57.560
I was home by 10.
She was gone by then.

50:01.598 --> 50:04.000
Well, if you think
of anything else,

50:04.002 --> 50:07.536
give me a call.

50:07.538 --> 50:09.205
Either of you.

50:09.207 --> 50:11.340
Oh, yes.

50:12.342 --> 50:13.743
I hope you find them.

50:13.745 --> 50:17.179
Me too.
Good day, ladies.

50:28.125 --> 50:30.726
Reilly?
What are you doing out here?

50:30.728 --> 50:32.661
I'm trying to figure out
what the hell happened

50:32.663 --> 50:35.097
to Priscilla birchman.

50:35.099 --> 50:36.532
Sorry about the "hell," father.

50:36.534 --> 50:38.534
Why? What about Priscilla?

50:38.536 --> 50:40.669
Her and her son drew
are missing.

50:40.671 --> 50:43.172
Oh, lord. Is there anything
i can do to help?

50:43.174 --> 50:46.142
I appreciate it.
I'll tell you, though,

50:46.144 --> 50:49.645
there's something odd
about that girl.

50:49.647 --> 50:52.648
Don't worry about it.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

51:09.066 --> 51:12.601
Dear lord, we beg you
through the intercession

51:12.603 --> 51:14.537
for the deliverance
of our brothers and sisters

51:14.539 --> 51:17.640
who are enslaved
by the evil one.

51:17.642 --> 51:20.342
All saints of heaven
come to our aid.

51:20.344 --> 51:22.778
Heavenly father, protect us.

51:34.458 --> 51:36.392
- Father.
- I'm sorry.

51:36.394 --> 51:39.128
I was in the neighborhood and
thought I'd stop by to say hi.

51:39.130 --> 51:41.230
Oh, please, come on in.

51:44.301 --> 51:46.836
Charlotte,
it's nice to see you.

51:46.838 --> 51:50.773
Hi, father.
What brings you here?

51:50.775 --> 51:53.275
I just wanted to stop by

51:53.277 --> 51:55.544
to see how you and your mom
were doing.

51:55.546 --> 51:59.548
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Black. Thanks.

52:02.652 --> 52:05.287
Well, how do you like it here?

52:09.426 --> 52:11.227
It's my home.

52:11.229 --> 52:14.663
If you don't mind, I'd like
to go lay back down now.

52:14.665 --> 52:16.232
Are you not feeling well?

52:16.234 --> 52:17.500
No.

52:17.502 --> 52:19.735
Go ahead
and get some rest.

52:19.737 --> 52:21.570
I put some extra covers
on your bed.

52:21.572 --> 52:23.806
Nice to see you, father.

52:23.808 --> 52:26.208
Feel better, my child.

52:27.777 --> 52:30.412
She's been a little
out of sorts.

52:32.415 --> 52:36.418
Is there something wrong?

52:36.420 --> 52:39.255
No, no, nothing's wrong.

52:39.257 --> 52:45.294
Julia, I hope you know you can
talk to me about anything.

52:49.232 --> 52:51.500
I don't know. I, uh...

52:51.502 --> 52:53.302
I just feel uncomfortable,

52:53.304 --> 52:55.905
knowing that
a little girl died here.

52:55.907 --> 52:59.742
I wish they would've told me
that before I bought this house.

52:59.744 --> 53:01.310
Did...

53:01.312 --> 53:03.245
Did Jeremy tell you?

53:03.247 --> 53:05.548
Yeah.
We had dinner last night.

53:07.751 --> 53:09.752
Look, you'll have
to understand,

53:09.754 --> 53:13.889
this has been a very difficult
few years for Jeremy.

53:13.891 --> 53:16.258
I mean, to lose your daughter
and then your wife

53:16.260 --> 53:18.861
in the same year
is devastating.

53:18.863 --> 53:19.895
What do you mean?

53:19.897 --> 53:21.897
Well, maddie and Olivia.

53:24.601 --> 53:28.337
Right.
Maddie, his daughter.

53:28.339 --> 53:30.239
How did his wife die?

53:30.241 --> 53:34.476
His ex-wife, actually.

53:34.478 --> 53:39.648
She... god rest her soul...
took her own life.

53:39.650 --> 53:44.820
She wanted to be with maddie
for eternity.

53:44.822 --> 53:46.922
- Doesn't suicide mean...
- Hell.

53:46.924 --> 53:48.824
Yes.

53:48.826 --> 53:52.661
But she, like most of us,

53:52.663 --> 53:55.864
believed that that's where
maddie's soul was dragged.

53:55.866 --> 53:57.366
What?

53:57.368 --> 53:59.235
I know this is difficult
to understand,

53:59.237 --> 54:02.838
but I don't believe that maddie
died from a worldly illness.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.307
I don't understand.

54:05.309 --> 54:07.309
See...

54:09.446 --> 54:14.917
I believe that maddie's body
was consumed by an evil demon.

54:14.919 --> 54:20.456
I know it's crazy,
but I think she was possessed.

54:20.458 --> 54:23.492
- Father, this is outrageous.
- Listen to me.

54:23.494 --> 54:25.261
I know it's difficult
to understand,

54:25.263 --> 54:29.765
but I think you and Charlotte
could be in danger.

54:29.767 --> 54:32.534
It's happened before,
and it could again.

54:32.536 --> 54:34.470
You need to leave this house.

54:36.339 --> 54:37.873
This is insane.

54:37.875 --> 54:40.876
Father, no offense, but I don't
believe in any of this.

54:40.878 --> 54:44.713
I was concerned because a little
girl died in here, not this.

54:44.715 --> 54:47.683
Five minutes ago, all I knew
was that Jeremy lost a patient,

54:47.685 --> 54:49.652
and now you're telling me
this horrible story.

54:49.654 --> 54:52.321
Wait. You didn't know it was
his daughter I'm talking about?

54:52.323 --> 54:54.290
No!

54:54.292 --> 54:57.726
I wouldn't have told you if
i didn't think you already knew.

54:57.728 --> 55:00.663
No. You know what?
I'm glad I did.

55:00.665 --> 55:03.732
You and Charlotte
need to leave this house.

55:06.336 --> 55:11.573
Father, I appreciate you looking
out for us and stopping by.

55:11.575 --> 55:13.542
I really do.

55:13.544 --> 55:14.677
We're fine.

55:20.383 --> 55:21.417
Please.

55:52.615 --> 55:53.582
Jeremy?

55:57.587 --> 55:58.921
Jeremy?

56:03.126 --> 56:04.993
Father.

56:04.995 --> 56:07.996
To what do i
owe this pleasure?

56:07.998 --> 56:12.134
Jeremy, look, I need
to talk to you.

56:12.136 --> 56:14.937
Look, it's about Julia
and Charlotte and the house.

56:14.939 --> 56:17.072
What about it now?

56:17.074 --> 56:20.642
Like I told you before,
Jeremy, it's the house.

56:20.644 --> 56:21.844
The house holds
its evil within.

56:21.846 --> 56:23.479
You have to get them out.

56:23.481 --> 56:26.415
Whatever you do,
don't go feeding this to Julia.

56:26.417 --> 56:28.717
You already drove Olivia
to commit suicide.

56:28.719 --> 56:31.854
She wouldn't listen to me,
but she might listen to you.

56:31.856 --> 56:34.456
Even if you don't believe me,
get them out of that house.

56:34.458 --> 56:37.092
Julia knows about maddie
and everything else.

56:37.094 --> 56:39.461
- How?
- You told her about maddie...

56:39.463 --> 56:40.929
I told her
maddie was just a patient.

56:40.931 --> 56:42.598
I know. I just assumed.

56:42.600 --> 56:45.100
Don't assume!
In fact, stay out of my life.

56:47.904 --> 56:51.039
I just want to be left alone.

56:51.041 --> 56:52.941
Jeremy!

56:52.943 --> 56:55.511
Everybody has left you alone,

56:55.513 --> 56:58.447
and that's why you're
still the way you are.

56:58.449 --> 57:01.917
Look at yourself.
You're shut down.

57:01.919 --> 57:03.152
You need to face it.

57:03.154 --> 57:07.189
Nefas did an awful thing.

57:07.191 --> 57:09.124
- But now...
- father!

57:09.126 --> 57:11.660
Father, listen to me.

57:11.662 --> 57:14.163
Nefas doesn't exist.

57:14.165 --> 57:16.832
Nefas has never existed.

57:16.834 --> 57:20.469
Maddie died.
She got sick.

57:20.471 --> 57:22.137
She got sick,
and that's the truth.

57:22.139 --> 57:24.973
Jeremy.

57:24.975 --> 57:28.710
I saw maddie!

57:32.882 --> 57:35.150
I saw what happened.

57:39.189 --> 57:42.791
Nefas is powerful,

57:42.793 --> 57:45.060
hell-bent on getting
what he came for.

57:48.965 --> 57:52.234
- Why are we talking about this?
- Because you need to face it.

57:52.236 --> 57:54.203
This isn't just
about you anymore.

57:54.205 --> 57:56.171
Julia and Charlotte
are in grave danger.

57:56.173 --> 57:59.174
What do you mean,
they're in grave danger?

57:59.176 --> 58:02.678
You said yourself,
this nefas only stays

58:02.680 --> 58:04.213
until he consumes the soul.

58:04.215 --> 58:08.617
What I'm saying is nefas
has remained in the house.

58:08.619 --> 58:13.522
It feeds off of consuming the
souls of innocent young girls.

58:13.524 --> 58:14.857
You have to let me try to...

58:14.859 --> 58:16.792
I'm done talking about this.

58:16.794 --> 58:19.795
In fact, I don't ever want
to hear about this again.

58:19.797 --> 58:22.865
I don't wanna see
your face again.

58:22.867 --> 58:26.702
Don't make the same
mistake twice. Jeremy!

59:20.156 --> 59:21.857
Olivia.

59:21.859 --> 59:24.293
Get away from me.

59:26.262 --> 59:27.796
If you would've
listened to me,

59:27.798 --> 59:31.099
our daughter
would still be alive.

59:31.101 --> 59:33.335
No, Olivia.

59:33.337 --> 59:38.173
If you would have gotten her
to the hospital like I told you,

59:38.175 --> 59:40.175
our daughter
would still be alive.

59:41.210 --> 59:43.245
Whoa, whoa.

59:43.247 --> 59:46.181
Think about
what you're doing.

59:46.183 --> 59:47.683
Put the gun down.

59:47.685 --> 59:51.153
Put the gun down.

59:51.155 --> 59:54.222
Olivia, do you think...

59:54.224 --> 59:56.892
do you think you're
the only one who suffered?

59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.930
Trust me.

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:05.734
We can work
through this together.

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:07.169
We can work through this
together.

01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:08.837
You couldn't even
help our baby.

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:09.838
Olivia, don't!

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:22.784
Don't!

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:15.737
Hi. Thanks so much for coming.

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:17.439
Of course.

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:31.019
Jeremy, I'm really sorry
about maddie.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:33.822
- Father Donald told me.
- I know.

01:01:33.824 --> 01:01:35.023
Thank you.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:36.458
Let's focus on Charlotte.

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:50.072
Would you mind getting Charlotte
a glass of water and a damp rag?

01:01:50.074 --> 01:01:51.840
Yes, of course.

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.890
You're here.

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:12.027
How are you feeling?

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:14.730
I feel great.

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:19.768
Well, you don't look great.

01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:23.405
Your mother says your rash
is getting worse,

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:25.207
and you have a fever.

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:28.276
Julia doesn't know
what she's talking about.

01:02:28.278 --> 01:02:31.113
Your mother says you'll be
going off to college soon.

01:02:31.115 --> 01:02:34.282
I don't wanna go to college.

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:36.852
It's much more fun here.

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:44.359
Do you like butterflies?

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:46.762
I'm sorry. What?

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:51.199
<i>I love butterflies.</i>

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:24.432
<i>What makes you think
it'll work this time?</i>

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:54.529
Did it just get
really cold in here?

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:57.098
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.600
Um...

01:03:58.602 --> 01:04:00.502
I gave her something
to help her sleep.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.470
The fever was
really getting to her.

01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:04.940
She'll be out
for a little while.

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:07.108
I have to run to my office
to get some antibiotics.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.511
I'll be right back.

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:15.383
Whatever you do,
don't go in there.

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:17.452
It might be contagious.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.151
<i>The skin markings.</i>

01:04:50.153 --> 01:04:51.953
<i>The inability to heal.</i>

01:04:51.955 --> 01:04:54.389
<i>These are all signs.</i>

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:58.126
<i>Nefas consumes the soul
of its host, Jeremy.</i>

01:04:58.128 --> 01:05:02.230
<i>Why can't you just believe
like Olivia does?</i>

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.478
Dispatch, this is
officer Reilly.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.347
I'm at the larsens,
looking for Priscilla's car.

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:21.216
Can I get a plate number
for that?

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:22.517
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.553
<i>Plate number...</i>

01:05:25.555 --> 01:05:34.029
<i>Hotel. Golf. 8. 4.
Tango. Mike. Victor.</i>

01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:35.130
<i>Over.</i>

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:53.248
Gotcha now.

01:05:57.688 --> 01:05:59.187
Hello.

01:05:59.189 --> 01:06:02.524
Mind if I have a word
with your mom?

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:04.426
My mom is not here.

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:09.631
Tell me, what's Priscilla's car
doing here?

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:13.201
Charlotte?

01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:15.070
Charlotte!

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:19.074
Julia!

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:41.363
Come on, come on.

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:43.431
Pick up, pick up!

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:54.309
Father.

01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:56.778
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:10.225
There are only two ways to
get rid of this kind of evil.

01:07:10.227 --> 01:07:13.762
Either it's dragged back to hell
by a spiritual nature,

01:07:13.764 --> 01:07:17.232
or it gets driven away
with one of these.

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:19.501
This crucifix will
offer us protection,

01:07:19.503 --> 01:07:22.337
while this book
will offer the passage

01:07:22.339 --> 01:07:23.738
that are going
to release Charlotte

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.540
from this hell
that's possessing her.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:27.542
Once I start, I have to finish
reading every word,

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:30.245
or we'll have to start
all over again, you understand?

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:32.147
Now here's what
i need you to do.

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:34.649
First off, grab those.

01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:37.185
Once we get in there,

01:07:37.187 --> 01:07:40.488
no matter what you see,
no matter what you hear,

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:43.358
I need you to keep your faith

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.295
because the devil is coming.

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:49.831
He'll try everything he can
to deceive you.

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:51.833
Trick is
to pay attention to me.

01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:54.369
Don't listen to him.
He's gonna try.

01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:57.072
Father.

01:07:57.074 --> 01:07:58.773
I'm afraid.

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:01.109
I know.

01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:03.111
So am I.

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:54.822
Show yourself!

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:01.563
Where are you?

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:24.072
Julia.

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:03.711
Jeremy.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.780
Remember.

01:13:05.782 --> 01:13:10.151
Your faith means nothing
if it's not tested.

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:30.671
Charlotte, are you all right?
Where's Julia?

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.780
Oh, my god.

01:13:38.782 --> 01:13:42.116
<i>There is no god here.</i>

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:46.921
Father.

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:11.512
Jeremy, now!

01:14:11.514 --> 01:14:14.449
Nefas! Exorcizámos te.

01:14:14.451 --> 01:14:17.185
Ómnis immúnde spíritus,

01:14:17.187 --> 01:14:19.754
ómnis satanic potéstas,

01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:22.490
ómnis infernális adversárii..

01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:24.225
Ómnis légio,

01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:27.695
ómnis congregation
et sécta diabólica,

01:14:27.697 --> 01:14:31.799
in nómine etvirtúte dómini
nóstri jésu chrísti.

01:14:33.203 --> 01:14:34.902
Father, the book!

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:36.737
<i>Your book can't save her!</i>

01:14:36.739 --> 01:14:39.740
Don't stop.
It's fine.

01:14:39.742 --> 01:14:44.045
Eradicáre et effugáre
a dei ecclésia,

01:14:44.047 --> 01:14:47.515
ab animábus ad imáginem
dei cónditis

ac pretióso divíni ágni

Non últra áudeas.

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:10.905
Dei ecclésiam pérsequi.

01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:15.042
Ac dei eléctos excútere
et cribráre sicut tríticum.

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:19.680
Dei ecclésiam pérsequi.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:24.952
Ac dei eléctos excútere
et cribráre sicut tríticum!

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:28.823
Dei ecclésiam pérsequi.

01:15:28.825 --> 01:15:35.229
Ac dei eléctos excútere
et cribráre sicut tríticum!

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:43.204
Is it over?

01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:44.739
I'm not sure.

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:52.813
<i>How do you expect to save her
when you couldn't save me?</i>

01:15:52.815 --> 01:15:54.782
Maddie?

01:15:54.784 --> 01:15:56.851
We have to tie her hands
to the bed.

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:02.857
- Jeremy, get her.
- But it's maddie.

01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:05.293
Yes, it's maddie,
but nefas corrupted her.

01:16:05.295 --> 01:16:07.295
We have to complete the ritual.

01:16:07.297 --> 01:16:10.698
Jeremy, you have
to trust me on this.

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:18.172
How is this possible?

01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:20.041
Her soul must be
tied to something.

01:16:20.043 --> 01:16:22.677
Something personal. Something
she holds dear to her heart.

01:16:22.679 --> 01:16:25.046
We need to find it and destroy
it if we're to save her soul.

01:16:25.048 --> 01:16:26.280
It has to be here.

01:16:30.819 --> 01:16:32.820
Maddie Miller.

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:38.726
Ímperat tíbi deus altíssimus,
cui in mágna tua supérbia.

01:16:38.728 --> 01:16:41.262
Te símile habéri

et ad agnitiónem

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:55.843
Ímperat tíbi deus altíssimus,
cui in mágna tua supérbia.

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:58.713
Te símile habéri
ádhuc praesúmis.

01:16:58.715 --> 01:17:01.382
Qui ómnes hóminess

et ad agnitiónem

01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:09.323
Ímperat tíbi deus altíssimus,

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:12.293
Te símile habéri

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:15.162
Qui ómnes hóminess

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:43.658
Maddie.

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:45.192
Yes, daddy?

01:17:45.194 --> 01:17:47.695
I'm so sorry.

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:49.864
I'm so sorry I didn't believe.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.334
I didn't get you help.

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:57.238
I'm so sorry, too, daddy.

01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:02.410
I didn't mean to bad.
I had to obey.

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:06.280
You need to let her go now.

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:19.393
Honey.

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:24.832
Your soul is free.

01:18:24.834 --> 01:18:26.133
Go.

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:29.236
Go to god.

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:47.354
I love you, daddy.

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:50.224
I love you too.

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:52.927
I love you so much.

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.780
Charlotte! Charlotte!

01:19:12.782 --> 01:19:14.749
- Mom?
- Oh, my god.

01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:17.284
Are you all right?
Oh, my god.

01:19:17.286 --> 01:19:20.521
I feel like shit.

01:19:20.523 --> 01:19:23.090
Watch your mouth,
young lady.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:25.993
Julia, it's good
to have you back.

01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:27.995
I need to get that cleaned.

01:19:27.997 --> 01:19:30.297
Let me patch you up
downstairs.

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:40.474
- I'm so tired.
- Okay.

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:42.877
Just close your eyes.

01:19:42.879 --> 01:19:44.912
Sleep now.

01:19:44.914 --> 01:19:47.081
Everything is
going to be okay.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:18.045
Thank you.

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:22.283
I know.

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:27.221
I'm gonna check on Charlotte.

01:20:49.277 --> 01:20:51.178
Is this...

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:58.352
What was that?

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:00.354
I don't know.

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:35.155
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

01:21:35.157 --> 01:21:37.358
I've never seen anything
like that before.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.026
Is this what maddie
had to obey?

01:21:39.028 --> 01:21:41.061
Oh, it must be!

01:21:42.965 --> 01:21:44.665
Jeremy, get the painting!

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:50.938
We cast you out,
most unclean, nefarious spirit,

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:54.241
every onslaught
of the infernal adversary!

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:04.685
Olivia.

01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:12.526
<i>Jeremy.</i>

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:17.031
<i>Jeremy.</i>

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.037
What do you want from me?

01:22:23.039 --> 01:22:25.673
<i>Jeremy.</i>

01:22:34.182 --> 01:22:39.720
<i>You killed my daughter.
I will make you pay.</i>

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:54.535
<i>I will show you the true
meaning of suffering.</i>

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:01.208
<i>Watch them die
by your own hands!</i>

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.328
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:40.147
Jeremy?

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:45.285
Jeremy?

01:23:51.494 --> 01:23:52.760
Father?

01:23:52.762 --> 01:23:55.396
- Julia, it's the painting.
- What?

01:23:55.398 --> 01:23:56.663
You have to destroy
the painting.

01:23:56.665 --> 01:23:59.767
What?

01:23:59.769 --> 01:24:02.569
<i>Julia! Julia!</i>

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:11.812
Olivia!

01:24:11.814 --> 01:24:14.681
Jeremy, you have
to fight back!

01:24:14.683 --> 01:24:18.052
She's only as powerful
as you allow her to be!

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:25.559
No, no, no!

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:28.295
I won't let you hurt her!

01:24:28.297 --> 01:24:30.731
- Please, god.
- Jeremy!
