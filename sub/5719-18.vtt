00:00.198 --> 00:01.675
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.718 --> 00:04.718
- Cassandra! Pull up!
- I'm trying!

00:04.753 --> 00:06.119
I can't believe Caleb
would buy you a horse

00:06.154 --> 00:07.521
that bolts like that.

00:07.556 --> 00:11.191
Some guys buy their girlfriends
jewelry... not Caleb.

00:11.227 --> 00:12.626
You have something I need, Bob;

00:12.661 --> 00:14.528
private land and plenty of black bears.

00:14.563 --> 00:17.130
- Go to hell.
- That's the wrong answer.

00:17.165 --> 00:19.199
You look beautiful.

00:19.235 --> 00:20.633
You don't look so bad yourself.

00:20.668 --> 00:23.203
When I found these rings
in my condo after you left

00:23.238 --> 00:26.439
I knew for sure that I did not
want this marriage to be over.

00:26.474 --> 00:27.841
Oh my God!

00:27.876 --> 00:29.642
The miniature horse,
we have to go grab them!

00:31.079 --> 00:32.445
Georgie!

00:33.882 --> 00:35.448
Georgie, get up!

00:36.951 --> 00:38.551
Thank you!

Spirit!

00:59.073 --> 01:00.338
Easy. Okay.

01:00.374 --> 01:02.641
Whoa. Settle.

01:02.676 --> 01:04.009
What happened to him?

01:04.044 --> 01:06.411
The usual. He's still a little skitzy.

01:06.446 --> 01:08.446
But he's gotten a lot
better that's for sure.

01:08.482 --> 01:10.482
Yeah. At least he's not bolting.

01:11.918 --> 01:13.385
So, it's New Years Eve.

01:13.420 --> 01:15.353
Do you have anything
special planned with Ty?

01:15.389 --> 01:17.355
I'd like to.

01:17.391 --> 01:19.524
Have you even celebrated
your anniversary yet?

01:19.559 --> 01:21.993
No. Ty's been crazy busy at the clinic

01:22.028 --> 01:23.762
and now, with the fire and everything,

01:23.797 --> 01:25.863
he's gonna be helping
Bob at the reserve.

01:25.899 --> 01:28.032
I'm not sure we'll get a chance to.

01:28.867 --> 01:30.268
So how do you know?

01:30.303 --> 01:33.337
- How do you know what?
- When you love someone?

01:33.372 --> 01:35.807
I don't know. You just do. Why?

01:36.932 --> 01:38.609
Oh, come on. You gotta tell me now.

01:38.644 --> 01:41.345
You're blushing? You never blush.

01:41.380 --> 01:44.504
- It's... Adam...
- Ohhh...

01:45.083 --> 01:46.717
The night of the fire.

01:46.752 --> 01:49.085
We never would have saved
the ponies without him.

01:49.121 --> 01:50.688
There was all this smoke.

01:50.723 --> 01:52.055
And he just went right into the pen.

01:52.090 --> 01:54.391
He was so awesome and brave.

01:54.427 --> 01:57.160
Okay. Well, here is a question for you.

01:57.196 --> 02:00.030
How do you feel when you see him?

02:00.065 --> 02:02.598
Oh, uh... I don't know.

02:02.634 --> 02:05.668
Kind of sick. But in a good way.

02:05.704 --> 02:07.337
That's a pretty sure sign.

02:07.372 --> 02:09.739
- Really?
- Yes. Tell me more.

02:13.545 --> 02:14.911
Hey.

02:17.749 --> 02:19.114
What's going on with Peter?

02:19.150 --> 02:20.883
What? There's nothing going on.

02:20.918 --> 02:22.652
What makes you think
there's something going on?

02:22.687 --> 02:24.097
He's still here.

02:24.176 --> 02:25.975
He didn't jump on a plane
like he usually does.

02:26.017 --> 02:26.313
Dad.

02:26.355 --> 02:27.906
And I saw the two of
you huddled together

02:27.959 --> 02:29.141
at the party last night.
What did he say?

02:29.183 --> 02:30.460
Okay. C'mon, dad.

02:34.631 --> 02:35.998
You really wanna know?

02:36.672 --> 02:37.566
Yeah.

02:38.666 --> 02:41.706
Okay. He-he wants to...

02:42.139 --> 02:43.605
He says he's willing
to do whatever it takes

02:43.640 --> 02:45.440
to make our marriage work.

02:45.476 --> 02:47.509
Really?

02:47.544 --> 02:49.711
Yes. Look,
I know you've never liked Peter,

02:49.747 --> 02:52.280
but this is my decision to make. Okay?

02:52.315 --> 02:53.682
So make the decision.

02:53.717 --> 02:55.417
And what decision would that be?

02:55.452 --> 02:56.985
Take him up on it!

02:57.020 --> 02:58.720
Oh, come on, Tim.

02:58.756 --> 03:01.256
It's not up to you or anyone else

03:01.291 --> 03:04.292
to tell Lou what she
should or shouldn't do.

03:04.327 --> 03:08.296
And besides since when have
you ever been on Peter's side?

03:08.331 --> 03:09.697
Yeah.

03:09.732 --> 03:12.033
Since he finally
started listening to me.

03:32.187 --> 03:33.821
Look. I don't know what to do yet, okay?

03:33.856 --> 03:35.689
It's not an easy decision to make.

03:35.725 --> 03:37.157
Well, no one says that it is.

03:37.192 --> 03:39.626
How hard can it be? Think of the kids.

03:39.661 --> 03:41.628
I am, dad! I do!

03:41.663 --> 03:43.997
Don't you think I know how
happy they are to see him?

03:44.033 --> 03:46.466
How they wish I could
just make this all better?

03:46.501 --> 03:48.802
Lou, if you pass on this
opportunity right now

03:48.837 --> 03:50.203
you're making a big mistake.

03:50.239 --> 03:51.771
Tim, just let it go.

03:51.807 --> 03:54.274
He's offering you everything
you've been asking for.

03:54.310 --> 03:56.609
Dad, I'd love this to work!

03:56.645 --> 03:58.177
But I'm honestly not sure it would.

03:58.212 --> 04:00.613
Not after all the water
that's gone under that bridge.

04:04.352 --> 04:06.453
Is this about dad wanting to come home?

04:06.488 --> 04:08.020
Is that what this is about?

04:08.056 --> 04:09.522
- Sweetheart...
- Then let him!

04:09.558 --> 04:10.957
Why can't you two get back together?

04:10.992 --> 04:12.992
You can make it work. I know you can!

04:13.027 --> 04:15.127
Everything could go back to normal.

04:15.163 --> 04:16.495
It's not that simple.

04:16.529 --> 04:19.671
Then stop making it difficult
and give it a chance.

04:20.685 --> 04:22.067
I'm going to untack the horses.

04:32.646 --> 04:35.180
- Hi...
- Adam.

04:38.368 --> 04:40.352
Good to see you.
Do you wanna go hang out?

04:40.387 --> 04:42.654
Umm... I'd like to, but I can't.

04:42.690 --> 04:44.456
Why?

04:45.255 --> 04:46.091
My dad...

04:46.126 --> 04:48.793
he's really ticked off
about the reserve thing.

04:48.828 --> 04:50.462
That we put ourselves in danger.

04:50.497 --> 04:52.230
But nothing happened to us!

04:52.265 --> 04:53.698
If we hadn't gone in when we did,

04:53.733 --> 04:55.100
all of those animals could have died.

04:55.135 --> 04:56.501
He has to understand that.

04:56.536 --> 04:57.984
Actually, he doesn't.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.271
He thinks we risked our lives
to save some random horses.

05:00.307 --> 05:02.473
That's ridiculous! We had to do it!

05:03.453 --> 05:04.675
Yeah, I know but...

05:05.479 --> 05:06.511
But what?

05:07.981 --> 05:09.881
My dad thinks you're a bad influence.

05:09.916 --> 05:11.382
He says we can't see each other anymore.

05:11.417 --> 05:13.117
He'd kill me if he knew I was here.

05:13.152 --> 05:15.119
You can't be serious.

05:16.523 --> 05:18.355
You didn't stand up to him?
You just gave in?

05:18.391 --> 05:19.856
Look Georgie. I tried. But he...

05:19.892 --> 05:21.958
I thought you were brave!

05:21.994 --> 05:24.161
I guess I was wrong.

05:25.864 --> 05:27.364
You have no guts at all.

05:49.888 --> 05:52.221
Okay, this doesn't feel right.

05:52.257 --> 05:53.622
Don't move.

05:53.658 --> 05:55.024
Stop. Stop!

05:55.060 --> 05:56.426
Hey, boy. Hey.

06:00.698 --> 06:02.765
All right.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.268
All right now... to the side.

06:07.471 --> 06:08.904
No, no, no, no, no!

06:08.940 --> 06:10.338
No! What are you doing?!

06:10.374 --> 06:11.740
Whoa, boy!

06:11.776 --> 06:13.108
No! Stop! Aghhh!

Georgie! Wait! Stop!

06:57.453 --> 06:58.819
Whoa! Whoa!

06:58.854 --> 07:00.221
You're riding a horse.

07:00.256 --> 07:03.324
Yeah, I am.

07:03.359 --> 07:05.626
How else was I supposed
to catch up to you?

07:05.661 --> 07:07.228
I'm not as gutless as you think I am.

07:07.263 --> 07:09.763
Guts or no guts,
you never should have taken this horse.

07:09.798 --> 07:11.832
- He's crazy and unpredictable.
- So are you.

07:11.867 --> 07:13.634
That's why we've got this
problem in the first place.

07:13.669 --> 07:15.702
Take my advice...
walk that horse back to the barn

07:15.738 --> 07:18.404
before it kills you and
run home to your daddy.

07:19.875 --> 07:22.442
Georgie! Wait!

07:22.477 --> 07:24.011
What's he doing?

07:25.781 --> 07:27.514
Hey.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.259
Hey.

07:39.294 --> 07:40.860
I got your message.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.262
So the cops nabbed the guy!

07:42.297 --> 07:43.630
Yeah. They did.

07:43.665 --> 07:45.131
That's great news!

07:45.167 --> 07:47.332
So did you tell them
about the phone calls

07:47.368 --> 07:48.868
and the threats?

07:48.903 --> 07:50.770
No. I didn't have to.

07:50.805 --> 07:52.972
A neighbor saw the guy's
truck leaving the reserve.

07:53.007 --> 07:54.540
Got the plate number.

07:54.575 --> 07:58.070
Wow. So that's it then.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.112
What a relief!

08:00.148 --> 08:01.647
I guess.

08:01.683 --> 08:03.114
A waste.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.350
Well, you can rebuild it, Bob.

08:05.386 --> 08:06.718
I'm not rebuilding anything.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.153
It's over.

08:08.189 --> 08:09.688
What do you mean it's over?

08:15.596 --> 08:18.430
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey, how are you?

08:18.465 --> 08:20.098
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.233
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:24.270 --> 08:28.765
Um,
so I was thinking it's New Years Eve...

08:29.228 --> 08:31.076
Maybe I can take you out to dinner.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.477
Actually,
Lisa is making dinner for all of us.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.879
Oh, don't let that keep you,
you both go.

08:37.482 --> 08:39.417
Yeah. Okay.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.719
Um, what do you think?

08:41.754 --> 08:45.423
Angelo's bistro in town maybe...
Reservation 7 or 8...?

08:46.583 --> 08:48.060
- Um...
- Daddy!

08:48.261 --> 08:49.960
Heyyyy!

08:51.431 --> 08:52.796
How are you doing pumpkin?

08:52.832 --> 08:54.164
- I'm not a pumpkin.
- You're not?!

08:54.200 --> 08:56.100
- What are you then!
- I'm Kitty-cat!

08:56.135 --> 08:59.169
You're a kitty cat!
How did I even forget that?

09:00.539 --> 09:03.696
Um... so, dinner? Yeah?

09:03.843 --> 09:05.609
- Yeah. Sure.
- Awesome.

09:06.598 --> 09:08.411
Okay. Okay. I'm coming.

09:14.185 --> 09:16.185
Hey! Hey! Come on now, Monty!

09:16.221 --> 09:17.954
You gotta stick up for your food.

09:19.391 --> 09:20.790
Amy's fallen in love with the guy

09:20.825 --> 09:22.158
and I just gotta make sure he eats.

09:23.595 --> 09:24.961
Here. Come on, Monty.

09:26.430 --> 09:27.997
There you go, bud.

09:28.032 --> 09:29.698
Talk about taking these
guys out of the frying pan

09:29.734 --> 09:32.534
and throwing them in
the proverbial fire, eh?

09:32.570 --> 09:35.504
A lot of good rescuing them
from that petting zoo did.

09:35.539 --> 09:37.539
I just put them in real danger.

09:37.575 --> 09:39.108
It could be a lot worse.

09:39.144 --> 09:40.509
They are all okay.

09:40.544 --> 09:41.910
Yeah.

09:42.669 --> 09:46.848
Look,
there's really not much you can do here

09:46.884 --> 09:48.550
for the next day or so.

09:48.586 --> 09:49.918
I gotta work the phones,

09:49.953 --> 09:51.320
start trying to find
homes for all these guys,

09:51.355 --> 09:52.888
so... you can take off.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.827
I get it. Okay?

09:58.862 --> 10:01.529
I can only imagine how
you feel right now.

10:01.564 --> 10:03.031
But you can't just walk away from this.

10:03.066 --> 10:06.701
Yeah? That's just what I'm gonna do.

10:21.951 --> 10:23.751
Can you just stop?

10:23.787 --> 10:25.586
Hurting a bit?

10:25.622 --> 10:28.289
Just so you know,
I did try talking to my parents.

10:28.325 --> 10:29.791
But they didn't listen.

10:29.826 --> 10:31.591
And I can't go totally against them.

10:31.627 --> 10:33.027
Well, why not?

10:33.062 --> 10:34.962
They have to know how you feel.

10:34.997 --> 10:37.664
How do you feel?
Do you think I'm a "bad influence"?

10:37.700 --> 10:40.634
- Yes. Yes, you are.
- Great.

10:42.438 --> 10:45.439
But it's not a bad thing. It's been fun.

10:46.876 --> 10:48.442
I've never had so much fun in my life.

10:48.477 --> 10:50.510
Whoa! What's he doing?

10:50.546 --> 10:51.911
How do I stop?!

10:51.947 --> 10:53.513
- How do I stop?!
- Whoa! Spirit!

10:53.549 --> 10:54.948
Whoa!

10:56.385 --> 10:57.751
Ho.

10:57.786 --> 10:59.619
Shh.

10:59.655 --> 11:01.455
I told you you can't be riding him.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.390
We should switch horses.

11:03.425 --> 11:04.790
I can handle him.

11:04.826 --> 11:06.492
Let's just go back to your place.

11:06.527 --> 11:08.962
My butt is killing me.

11:08.997 --> 11:12.776
No. I can't go back yet.
My dad is there and...

11:12.966 --> 11:15.601
I don't know what's going on
between him and my mom but...

11:16.153 --> 11:18.304
I have to stay out of their way.

11:18.632 --> 11:19.973
Okay.

11:21.442 --> 11:22.808
So let's keep riding.

11:22.844 --> 11:24.209
Give me some tips.

11:24.245 --> 11:26.579
Okay, tip number one;
Take your fanny pack off.

11:26.614 --> 11:28.614
It makes you look like a total dweeb.

11:34.689 --> 11:36.054
Tip number two.

11:36.090 --> 11:38.790
Loosen up your reins. Just relax.

11:41.929 --> 11:43.295
Okay.

11:49.270 --> 11:51.036
Hey Georgie,
can you give me a call back.

11:51.071 --> 11:53.505
I see that Adams bike is
here and the horses are gone

11:53.540 --> 11:55.306
so I assume you're out riding.

11:55.341 --> 11:57.341
But don't let Adam ride Spirit, okay?

11:57.377 --> 11:59.611
Just give me a call.
Bye.

11:59.646 --> 12:02.346
- Hey!
- Hey.

12:05.114 --> 12:06.618
How's Monty?

12:07.108 --> 12:07.985
He's good.

12:08.021 --> 12:09.421
The other horses are
still picking on him,

12:09.456 --> 12:11.655
but he's starting to hold his own.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.524
And Bob? How's he doing?

12:13.559 --> 12:15.927
He's pretty depressed. Ready to give up.

12:15.962 --> 12:17.895
Poor guy. I can't even imagine.

12:17.931 --> 12:19.830
I offered to help him but
he just sort of blew me off.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.966
So I'll give him some space.

12:22.001 --> 12:25.769
That could be good
because I have an idea.

12:27.172 --> 12:29.205
Oh oh. That could be trouble.

12:29.241 --> 12:31.642
Ty, we have to do something
for our anniversary.

12:31.677 --> 12:33.343
We can't just forget about it.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.378
Okay.

12:35.414 --> 12:38.549
So I was thinking that we
could maybe pack our bags

12:38.584 --> 12:40.717
and go somewhere for the night.

12:40.753 --> 12:42.352
You know, like to the fishing cabin,

12:42.387 --> 12:44.387
we could stay over, just the two of us.

12:44.423 --> 12:46.222
It would be special.

12:46.258 --> 12:50.347
Yeah, sure. Sounds good.

12:52.097 --> 12:53.430
Are you all right?

12:53.465 --> 12:55.832
Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...

12:57.369 --> 12:59.969
I just really wanna get away with you.

13:00.004 --> 13:03.439
- Okay. Let's do it then.
- Okay.

13:04.843 --> 13:06.208
Okay.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.680
You know, what you said was true.

13:10.715 --> 13:12.548
Wow. Can you repeat that?

13:12.584 --> 13:14.450
No. I won't.

13:14.486 --> 13:16.452
But I will stand up to my dad.

13:16.487 --> 13:18.253
My parents can't always
tell me what to do.

13:18.289 --> 13:19.654
I'm in charge of my own life, right?

13:21.125 --> 13:23.192
- Whoa!
- Spirit! Whoa!

13:23.227 --> 13:24.826
- Spirit!
- Agh!

13:24.862 --> 13:26.462
Adam!

13:28.132 --> 13:30.099
Are you okay?

13:31.568 --> 13:33.167
Yeah. I'm fine.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.803
Spirit!

13:39.809 --> 13:41.983
I can't believe that horse
ran off with my bag.

13:42.090 --> 13:42.743
What am I going to do?

13:42.806 --> 13:45.719
- That is a very small problem!
- No, it isn't!

13:45.835 --> 13:48.193
Spirit is gone!
He doesn't even belong to us!

13:48.362 --> 13:50.897
Amy's going to kill me
if we don't find him.

13:50.933 --> 13:53.248
Why are you so worried about
your stupid fanny pack?

13:53.343 --> 13:54.884
Because...

13:55.770 --> 13:57.209
Because my cell phone was in it.

13:57.463 --> 14:00.272
Okay, when we find the horse,
you can find your phone.

14:03.845 --> 14:04.914
Okay.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.446
Come on, put your foot in.

14:10.252 --> 14:12.051
Here we go. Okay.

14:13.521 --> 14:14.887
Okay.

14:19.727 --> 14:21.126
So where are we going?

14:21.162 --> 14:22.495
It's a surprise.

14:22.530 --> 14:23.896
I don't want a surprise, Peter.

14:23.932 --> 14:25.498
Just get in. Come on.

14:26.701 --> 14:28.267
Come on.

14:35.632 --> 14:40.446
So there is a piece of property
about three miles west of here.

14:40.994 --> 14:43.148
It's a beautiful little house on it,
some acreage...

14:43.184 --> 14:44.549
and it's for sale.

14:44.585 --> 14:47.151
Don't do this, Peter.

14:47.844 --> 14:49.354
Do what?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.790
Just don't act like you
can walk back into my life

14:51.825 --> 14:53.592
and take it over.

14:54.313 --> 14:55.760
Make decisions.

14:55.796 --> 14:58.029
What decisions?
I'm not making any decision.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.564
"Let's go for a drive".

14:59.600 --> 15:01.399
Oh and
"this is where we're going to live."

15:01.434 --> 15:03.101
"This is where we're going for dinner."

15:03.136 --> 15:04.602
Whatever.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.937
Okay. We don't have to go out to dinner.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.973
We don't have to go out at
all if you don't want to.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.775
Good. Because I would actually
rather just have dinner at home

15:11.811 --> 15:14.565
with the girls and the
rest of the family.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.984
And you too, of course...

15:21.420 --> 15:23.554
Okay.

15:24.512 --> 15:26.211
Listen, um...

15:28.694 --> 15:30.160
I know I can't expect you to agree

15:30.195 --> 15:32.029
to get back together just like that.

15:32.064 --> 15:33.397
I know that.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.798
And I know that it might be too late

15:35.834 --> 15:39.403
for me to try and make this work,
but I have got to try.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.671
You know the whole reason I wanted
to bring you out to see this house

15:41.706 --> 15:44.174
is because I want you to know
that I mean what I'm saying.

15:47.249 --> 15:48.864
I need you.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.180
I really do and...

15:51.215 --> 15:52.882
I miss you...

15:54.318 --> 15:55.985
and the girls.

15:58.985 --> 16:01.123
And I'm gonna be closer to you guys.

16:02.794 --> 16:04.460
And uh...

16:05.897 --> 16:07.829
I just realized

16:09.500 --> 16:12.234
without you guys my
whole life is just...

16:14.272 --> 16:16.238
just empty.

16:20.211 --> 16:23.311
Well, the other night you brought up,
something...

16:23.346 --> 16:24.713
someone...

16:24.748 --> 16:27.348
I told you that that's over. It is over.

16:27.384 --> 16:29.384
And I also told you that
it is the worst mistake

16:29.419 --> 16:30.819
I have ever made in my life.

16:30.854 --> 16:33.388
That day when she walked
into your apartment,

16:34.825 --> 16:36.592
in front of Georgie...

16:38.062 --> 16:40.061
that was my wake up call, Peter.

16:41.465 --> 16:43.764
It was mine too. It was.

16:45.569 --> 16:48.669
When I saw your ring on the table...
I just...

16:48.705 --> 16:51.072
I felt like,

16:51.108 --> 16:53.274
I felt like I was being ripped apart.

16:55.878 --> 16:58.079
And I'm so sorry.

17:01.584 --> 17:04.085
I just wanna know if maybe we can...

17:04.119 --> 17:07.506
just put all that behind us?

17:07.690 --> 17:11.040
I don't know. I'm trying.

17:13.962 --> 17:16.163
- I'm trying...
- Okay.

17:17.599 --> 17:20.567
Let's just um, let's go back inside.

17:41.056 --> 17:42.421
We should just go back.

17:42.457 --> 17:44.190
No. I need to find him.

17:47.428 --> 17:49.495
Whoa! What's wrong?!

17:49.531 --> 17:51.030
Are you okay?

17:51.065 --> 17:52.465
Just hang on to me.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.967
Yeah. I'm good.

17:55.002 --> 17:56.536
Do you have anything to eat?

17:56.571 --> 17:58.037
A granola bar or something?

17:58.072 --> 17:59.838
No. Why? Are you hungry?

18:00.741 --> 18:02.841
No. I'm fine.

18:02.877 --> 18:04.677
Okay. Let's go.

18:06.446 --> 18:08.013
Okay. We're gonna head out.

18:08.049 --> 18:09.782
Where are you going?

18:09.817 --> 18:11.383
Oh, you're gonna miss Lisa's dinner.

18:11.418 --> 18:12.785
I know. I'm sorry.

18:12.820 --> 18:14.186
We're heading up to the fishing cabin

18:14.221 --> 18:15.587
to bring in the New Year.

18:15.622 --> 18:16.989
Hey,
can you tell Georgie to give me a call

18:17.024 --> 18:18.390
when she gets in, please.

18:18.425 --> 18:20.192
Okay.
You check the road conditions before go.

18:20.227 --> 18:21.593
It gets bad out there.

18:21.628 --> 18:23.127
We'll be fine. Don't worry, grandpa.

18:23.163 --> 18:27.332
Amy, he's right.
The road to the cabin is closed.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.967
- What?
- I should have checked earlier.

18:30.003 --> 18:31.503
I don't believe this.

18:36.542 --> 18:37.909
Spirit!

18:37.944 --> 18:39.310
Where are you, boy?

18:41.748 --> 18:43.414
Come on, bud.

18:43.449 --> 18:46.050
Adam!

18:46.086 --> 18:48.019
What's the matter? What's going on?

18:48.054 --> 18:49.553
I can't go any further.

18:49.589 --> 18:51.255
Why? What's wrong?

18:52.658 --> 18:54.692
Adam, are you okay?

18:55.910 --> 18:59.063
I'm diabetic. I need my kit.

18:59.274 --> 19:00.831
It's in that fanny pack.

19:06.717 --> 19:09.170
Why didn't you tell me?
You never told me.

19:09.286 --> 19:10.752
I don't tell people.

19:10.788 --> 19:12.487
Why not?!

19:17.494 --> 19:18.860
I need to call someone.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.530
Oh. There's no service.

19:27.183 --> 19:28.872
Can you make it over there?

19:28.906 --> 19:30.906
I'll try.

19:30.941 --> 19:33.275
I really wanted to go to the cabin.

19:33.310 --> 19:34.709
It was important for me and
Ty to be able to get away.

19:34.744 --> 19:36.278
It's not the end of the world, Amy.

19:36.313 --> 19:38.045
Why are you being so emotional?

19:38.080 --> 19:39.947
I'm not being emotional!

19:39.982 --> 19:41.349
Yes you are.

19:41.384 --> 19:43.083
Look, I don't mean to sound selfish,

19:43.119 --> 19:45.152
but I'm the one here who
has to make a decision

19:45.188 --> 19:47.455
that's gonna affect the
lives of my entire family,

19:47.490 --> 19:49.791
and I'm calmer than you are.

19:49.826 --> 19:51.192
I'm sorry.

19:51.227 --> 19:53.460
Lou!
Katie's looking for her red sweater!

19:53.495 --> 19:55.629
It's in her bottom drawer.

19:55.664 --> 19:57.364
Did you see it?

19:57.399 --> 20:00.734
Here. At least we're out of the wind.

20:02.805 --> 20:04.604
Here. Are you warm enough?

20:05.268 --> 20:06.340
Take this.

20:06.375 --> 20:07.942
No. Keep it.

20:09.015 --> 20:11.077
Where-where is he horse? I can ride.

20:11.112 --> 20:14.080
You're not getting on
a horse anytime soon.

20:14.115 --> 20:15.482
Then you go.

20:15.517 --> 20:17.283
I'm not gonna leave here.

20:17.319 --> 20:18.685
My kit... I need it.

20:18.721 --> 20:20.654
But you'll be all alone
and that's not good!

20:20.689 --> 20:23.457
Georgie. Just go.

20:25.994 --> 20:27.760
Okay. Fine.

20:33.634 --> 20:35.801
Georgie and Adam should be
back from their ride by now.

20:35.837 --> 20:37.536
There's gotta be a
reason why they're not.

20:37.572 --> 20:38.938
I'd go out and look for them

20:38.974 --> 20:40.340
but I don't even know
which way they went.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.208
So I probably never find them.

20:42.244 --> 20:45.378
Amy, don't worry about them, okay?

20:45.413 --> 20:47.847
They're fine.
They're out on a trail ride having fun.

20:47.882 --> 20:49.715
You know, young love.

20:49.751 --> 20:51.417
Don't get yourself all worked up.

20:51.452 --> 20:53.786
I'm not worked up, Ty.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.560
Come here. It's okay.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.897
I just really wanted to get away.
Tonight.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.999
You know just the two of us.

21:07.034 --> 21:09.667
Some alone time.

21:09.703 --> 21:12.004
Okay. Tell you what.

21:12.039 --> 21:13.705
We'll do dinner with the family.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.207
We'll come back here.

21:15.242 --> 21:16.974
I'll build us a fire.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.776
We can toast The New Year...

21:18.811 --> 21:20.477
And our anniversary...

21:20.513 --> 21:22.213
And our anniversary.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.580
And the future.

21:25.484 --> 21:28.140
And the future. Okay?

21:30.423 --> 21:31.889
2 seconds.

21:33.326 --> 21:34.658
Hey, Bob.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.861
Uh. yeah. I can be there in ten minutes.

21:39.598 --> 21:41.064
Sure. Okay.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.234
It must have been important, Amy,

21:44.269 --> 21:46.002
otherwise he wouldn't have called me.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.538
Do you want to come for a quick ride.

21:47.573 --> 21:49.205
No, I should probably stay here

21:49.241 --> 21:51.174
for when Georgie gets back.

21:51.209 --> 21:53.797
Okay. She'll be fine.

22:28.446 --> 22:30.179
Spirit!

22:30.214 --> 22:31.580
Where are you, boy?!

22:33.017 --> 22:34.883
Come on. We gotta find you.

22:45.896 --> 22:47.929
Good boy.

22:47.965 --> 22:49.397
Hey, boy.

22:50.968 --> 22:52.601
Good boy.

23:18.661 --> 23:19.994
Good boy.

23:21.864 --> 23:23.664
Good boy.

23:25.067 --> 23:26.901
Good boy. Come on.

23:29.371 --> 23:30.737
Good boy!

23:41.917 --> 23:45.213
Adam,
I've got your ugly fanny pack thing.

23:48.156 --> 23:50.289
Adam talk to me!
I don't know what to do!

23:52.326 --> 23:54.193
Adam, talk to me!

23:54.228 --> 23:56.195
I don't know what to do!

23:56.230 --> 23:57.564
I don't want to hurt you!

23:57.599 --> 23:59.566
Do I just stick the needle in?

23:59.601 --> 24:01.000
No!

24:01.036 --> 24:02.769
What do you mean no? Where do I do it?

24:02.804 --> 24:05.218
No! No. The sugar!

24:05.606 --> 24:07.106
It's in there.

24:08.909 --> 24:10.443
This?

24:11.879 --> 24:13.745
The sugar? Not the needle?

24:13.781 --> 24:15.376
Not the needle.

24:27.194 --> 24:28.794
Is it enough?

24:31.031 --> 24:32.764
You okay?

24:54.877 --> 24:57.977
Okay. Tell me what actually
would have happened

24:58.013 --> 25:00.179
if I'd given you that needle?

25:00.215 --> 25:02.215
You would have killed me.

25:03.808 --> 25:07.020
Wow. Sorry.

25:07.871 --> 25:09.521
That's okay.

25:10.758 --> 25:12.292
This is all my fault.

25:12.327 --> 25:15.431
Your dad is right.
I'm a total trouble magnet.

25:15.695 --> 25:17.630
Yeah. Yeah. You are.

25:18.914 --> 25:22.335
We should have just gone
home like you had said.

25:22.370 --> 25:23.305
I get that.

25:23.471 --> 25:25.070
The whole thing with your parents...

25:25.106 --> 25:26.772
They're both kind of messed up.

25:26.807 --> 25:29.008
All parents are kind of messed up.

25:29.043 --> 25:31.377
No way. You're lucky.
Your parents are normal.

25:31.412 --> 25:33.112
They've got their faults.

25:33.148 --> 25:35.681
They're totally overprotective.

25:35.716 --> 25:38.017
They have been ever
since I was diagnosed.

25:38.052 --> 25:40.119
I'm the typical only child.

25:40.154 --> 25:42.087
That explains a lot.

25:42.123 --> 25:43.889
What's that supposed to mean?

25:43.924 --> 25:45.557
I'm kidding.

25:51.198 --> 25:54.133
What do you hope will
happen with your parents?

25:54.168 --> 25:56.468
I don't know.

25:56.503 --> 25:58.703
I've gotten kinda used
to the separation.

26:00.106 --> 26:03.708
We still feel like a family
in a really weird way.

26:05.179 --> 26:08.713
Mostly I just want
them both to be happy.

26:08.748 --> 26:10.081
Isn't that the most important thing?

26:10.116 --> 26:11.716
For two people to be happy?

26:18.725 --> 26:20.925
Are you feeling better enough to ride?

26:20.960 --> 26:23.627
We should head back before it gets dark.

26:24.633 --> 26:27.065
I think I'm good to go.

26:27.100 --> 26:28.732
Thanks to you.

26:28.767 --> 26:30.167
You're a rock star.

26:31.232 --> 26:34.338
You saved my life in the fire.
I guess it was my turn.

26:38.444 --> 26:40.777
Yeah. He's looking great.

26:40.813 --> 26:42.846
I think he'll be ready to go back soon.

26:42.881 --> 26:45.582
All right.
Well, this guy is ready to go now.

26:46.661 --> 26:49.552
Which is good. One less mouth to feed.

26:52.091 --> 26:56.348
Bob, you see that eagle.

26:56.595 --> 26:58.428
Wouldn't have made it without you.

26:58.463 --> 27:00.797
And neither would this owl.

27:00.833 --> 27:02.898
That's what you do here, man.

27:02.934 --> 27:05.000
That's what makes this place worth it.

27:05.029 --> 27:07.936
Look, I appreciate the pep talk,

27:07.971 --> 27:10.505
but I don't think you fully get it.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.774
This guy? The one they arrested...

27:12.809 --> 27:14.976
He didn't just threaten
me and the reserve,

27:15.011 --> 27:16.712
he threatened the kids that work here.

27:16.747 --> 27:18.980
So now I'm not just putting
animal lives in danger.

27:19.015 --> 27:21.550
I'm putting peoples lives in danger.
Kids.

27:23.220 --> 27:24.585
If something were to happen,

27:24.621 --> 27:26.855
like I can't deal with that, man.

27:26.890 --> 27:29.590
They got the guy, Bob.
He's going to jail.

27:29.626 --> 27:32.560
Yeah. For how long?

27:51.881 --> 27:54.548
Look, I gotta face facts, man.

27:54.584 --> 27:56.917
What if the poacher comes back?

28:01.456 --> 28:02.923
Then we'll fight him.

28:04.393 --> 28:06.459
I told you. I'm here to help.

28:07.930 --> 28:10.230
I believe in this place, Bob.

28:13.535 --> 28:14.901
Okay.

28:16.338 --> 28:18.104
Okay.

28:18.139 --> 28:20.540
I'll give it one more chance.

28:27.015 --> 28:28.581
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

28:28.617 --> 28:29.982
There's no need for that.

28:30.018 --> 28:32.618
No, I was selfish.

28:32.653 --> 28:35.254
And I really do want to help.

28:35.290 --> 28:36.655
So let me know what can I do?

28:36.691 --> 28:39.125
There is nothing you really can do, Amy.

28:39.160 --> 28:42.645
I have to solve this for myself.

28:43.198 --> 28:45.264
And I haven't figured it out yet.

28:46.300 --> 28:49.000
But I understand why you wanna get away

28:49.036 --> 28:51.102
from this crazy family.

28:51.138 --> 28:53.672
- Lou.
- Especially for your anniversary.

28:53.708 --> 28:56.107
Peter and I let off wish
balloons from the dude ranch

28:56.143 --> 28:57.676
on our first.

28:57.712 --> 28:59.411
That must have been amazing.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.112
Yeah. It was.

29:02.315 --> 29:04.049
Hey, if you and Ty want to get away,

29:04.084 --> 29:05.783
why don't you spend the
night at the dude ranch?

29:05.819 --> 29:08.453
I kind of screwed it up for
you on your wedding night.

29:08.488 --> 29:11.569
Well, we can't Peter's there.

29:11.674 --> 29:13.691
He can stay in your old room.

29:13.727 --> 29:16.228
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

29:17.070 --> 29:19.564
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Of course I'm sure.

29:19.599 --> 29:21.599
You can come and have
a nice family dinner,

29:21.634 --> 29:23.000
have a glass of wine,

29:23.035 --> 29:25.253
and not have to worry
about driving back here.

29:25.913 --> 29:28.740
- All right. I love it.
- Okay.

29:28.775 --> 29:30.541
It's a great idea.

29:32.645 --> 29:34.945
I was thinking,
do you remember our first dates here?

29:36.190 --> 29:38.648
Of course.

29:38.684 --> 29:40.317
Pretty special...

29:40.353 --> 29:42.386
Yeah.

29:45.995 --> 29:48.292
Look at you...

30:13.218 --> 30:14.750
Okay, I'll see you at dinner.

30:14.786 --> 30:16.219
Okay.

30:18.390 --> 30:20.856
Oh, I got a bottle of champagne.
I'll bring.

30:20.892 --> 30:22.258
Okay.

30:31.869 --> 30:33.903
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:35.339 --> 30:37.105
What? You're not even talking to me now?

30:37.141 --> 30:38.841
What kind of a friend is that?

30:41.111 --> 30:43.345
So, you two, uh...

30:43.380 --> 30:45.384
Looks like you're patching things up?

30:46.162 --> 30:47.904
That's good.

30:48.141 --> 30:50.118
For him... not me.

30:56.526 --> 30:58.160
I hope it's what you want, Lou.

31:09.162 --> 31:11.405
Hey, Lou, hold up!

31:11.441 --> 31:13.291
I'll just catch a ride with you.

31:20.350 --> 31:22.116
Voila!

31:42.004 --> 31:43.370
Oh great.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.608
My dad's here.

31:56.533 --> 31:57.911
Where have you been?

31:58.016 --> 32:00.435
Your mother has been worried sick.

32:00.470 --> 32:02.704
We were just out on a trail ride.

32:02.739 --> 32:04.238
No big deal.

32:04.273 --> 32:06.907
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.

32:09.942 --> 32:13.013
Lou. I'd like you to meet Jim Parker,

32:13.049 --> 32:14.749
this is Adam's father.

32:14.784 --> 32:16.183
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:16.219 --> 32:19.086
This is Peter, my... husband.

32:19.121 --> 32:21.355
Hey Jim. Nice to meet you.

32:21.390 --> 32:22.481
Nice to meet you.

32:22.558 --> 32:24.458
Grandpa,
have you offered Mr. Parker a drink

32:24.493 --> 32:25.542
or a coffee or...

32:25.634 --> 32:28.228
No, thank you.
I'm not here to be social, I'm afraid.

32:29.420 --> 32:30.330
- Oh...
- Oh...

32:30.366 --> 32:31.899
I'll get right to the point.

32:31.934 --> 32:34.734
My son has always had an
exemplary code of conduct.

32:34.770 --> 32:36.670
He has never been in
any kind of trouble.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.639
Never.

32:38.674 --> 32:40.174
And all of a sudden he's
been getting himself

32:40.209 --> 32:42.042
into scrape after scrape.

32:42.077 --> 32:43.777
And it just so happens to coincide

32:43.812 --> 32:45.945
with him tutoring your daughter,
Georgie.

32:45.981 --> 32:47.914
Okay. Now wait just a minute...

32:47.949 --> 32:50.850
And today, he was out with her again,

32:50.886 --> 32:53.251
getting into God knows what.

32:54.636 --> 32:58.624
I told you...
we were out for a trail ride.

32:59.913 --> 33:02.395
I don't care where you were.

33:02.430 --> 33:05.198
You guys and this
situation you got going on.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.233
I don't like it.

33:09.237 --> 33:11.036
And I told you.

33:11.072 --> 33:14.539
I don't want you seeing each other.
Understand?

33:19.979 --> 33:22.741
This is the first we're
hearing about any of this...

33:27.621 --> 33:31.555
No. I don't understand.

33:32.854 --> 33:35.526
You can't just tell me that.
You don't even know Georgie.

33:35.561 --> 33:38.329
We're friends.
She's probably my best friend.

33:38.364 --> 33:40.431
She just saved my life out there.

33:40.466 --> 33:42.600
- Excuse me?
- What?

33:42.635 --> 33:45.469
I lost my kit and she found it for me.
Just in time.

33:45.504 --> 33:48.205
She's amazing. And brave.

33:48.241 --> 33:49.985
And totally awesome.

33:51.143 --> 33:53.277
I'm sorry dad,
but Georgie and I are gonna hang out

33:53.312 --> 33:54.929
no matter what you say.

33:56.616 --> 33:58.282
So what am I supposed to do, son?

33:58.317 --> 34:00.651
Let you guys just keep screwing up?

34:00.686 --> 34:02.052
I'm bound to screw up!

34:02.087 --> 34:04.487
People screw up all the time.
Nobody's perfect!

34:04.522 --> 34:06.644
But hey! I'll try.

34:06.842 --> 34:08.859
I promise that I will try.

34:08.893 --> 34:11.628
I'm really sorry if you think
I'm a bad influence, Mr. Parker.

34:11.663 --> 34:14.130
I don't mean to be. Ever.

34:14.166 --> 34:15.766
I like Adam way too much.

34:17.449 --> 34:20.270
Okay. I think that there is
some explaining to do here...

34:20.304 --> 34:22.905
but maybe we do it over dinner.

34:22.940 --> 34:25.608
Mr. Parker... Jim,

34:25.643 --> 34:27.610
Would you like to stay for dinner,
both of you.

34:27.646 --> 34:29.312
No, thank you.

34:29.347 --> 34:31.380
That's really nice of
you but my wife and I

34:31.416 --> 34:33.257
We have some guests coming over.

34:33.601 --> 34:35.384
Can I stay?

34:35.418 --> 34:36.786
No. I want you home.

34:36.821 --> 34:39.554
And your mother is,
she's worried enough.

34:41.692 --> 34:43.859
Fine.
But I'm coming to pick you up later,

34:43.895 --> 34:45.895
you better be here.

34:45.929 --> 34:47.629
Fine.

34:47.665 --> 34:49.063
Can I throw my bike in the car?

34:50.534 --> 34:51.900
Sure.

34:52.815 --> 34:54.636
- It was nice meeting you all.
- Good to meet you.

34:54.672 --> 34:56.036
Nice to meet you. You take care.

34:56.072 --> 34:58.307
- Happy New Year, Jim.
- All right. Thank you.

35:05.081 --> 35:06.548
Okay.

35:06.583 --> 35:10.384
So what is this about
saving Adam's life?

35:10.420 --> 35:12.520
He's exaggerating.

35:14.224 --> 35:16.757
I wanted to talk to
you about what I said.

35:18.228 --> 35:20.228
Listen, I know what you said.

35:20.263 --> 35:22.697
And you're right, Georgie.

35:22.732 --> 35:24.665
I'm making this difficult,
I'm trying, honey.

35:24.701 --> 35:26.099
No. No. You and dad...

35:26.135 --> 35:27.868
You need to do what's best for you.

35:27.903 --> 35:29.537
I want you to be happy.

35:29.572 --> 35:31.505
We'll all gonna be fine
whatever you decide.

35:31.541 --> 35:33.541
We're fine now.

35:33.576 --> 35:34.942
Yeah.

35:42.484 --> 35:43.817
Yeah.

35:43.853 --> 35:45.752
Everyone,
I know it's not quite midnight.

35:45.787 --> 35:47.221
But I think that since
we are all together

35:47.256 --> 35:50.224
Maybe we should toast
the New Year right now.

35:50.259 --> 35:53.060
- All right.
- And to all that it will bring.

35:53.095 --> 35:54.694
- Cheers!
- Cheers!!

35:54.730 --> 35:56.629
Happy New Year!

35:56.665 --> 35:58.030
Cheers.

35:58.066 --> 36:01.000
I just like to say that
I'm very glad and fortunate

36:01.035 --> 36:02.435
to be back at your table,

36:02.471 --> 36:04.136
especially with my
three beautiful girls.

36:04.172 --> 36:06.305
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

36:06.341 --> 36:09.075
Right over there.

36:09.110 --> 36:11.511
Yes. And we better get going.

36:11.546 --> 36:14.780
Because we are gonna spend the
night at the dude ranch cabin.

36:14.815 --> 36:16.782
Like we were supposed
to on our wedding night.

36:16.817 --> 36:18.784
Ah yeah.
And you didn't forget the key this time.

36:18.819 --> 36:20.586
She didn't. Thank you, Lou.

36:20.621 --> 36:22.021
- It's right here.
- Oh good.

36:22.056 --> 36:23.422
Happy anniversary.

36:23.457 --> 36:25.291
Happy Happy New Year!

36:25.326 --> 36:26.926
- Have a lovely time.
- Goodnight guys.

36:26.961 --> 36:29.195
Have fun.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.763
All right. Can everyone pitch in

36:30.798 --> 36:32.163
and we can get this cleaned-up.

36:32.199 --> 36:33.565
- Yeah.
- Yep.

36:33.601 --> 36:34.966
- Not you, you've done enough.
- Oh you sure.

36:35.002 --> 36:36.402
- You guys go sit by the fire.
- Yes. Absolutely.

36:36.437 --> 36:37.803
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

36:37.838 --> 36:39.438
Katie, you wanna go play in your room.

36:40.974 --> 36:43.241
- Okay, mommy!
- Okay.

36:43.277 --> 36:45.277
Good girl.

36:45.312 --> 36:47.545
- That was nice.
- Yeah.

36:48.949 --> 36:50.315
Yeah. Thanks for inviting me.

36:50.350 --> 36:53.184
- Hm-hmm.
- I hope that's a sign.

36:54.854 --> 36:57.855
You know, actually,
we should-we should talk.

36:57.891 --> 36:59.490
- You wanna...?
- Okay.

37:08.501 --> 37:10.000
Okay.

37:10.870 --> 37:12.770
I might as well just say this.

37:12.806 --> 37:15.205
This single parenting thing...

37:15.241 --> 37:17.174
I've just figured it out.

37:17.209 --> 37:19.343
And I feel like we both have.

37:19.378 --> 37:21.278
And we're good at it.

37:21.314 --> 37:24.114
You know, I'm so proud of us.

37:25.584 --> 37:27.684
But I can't go backwards, Peter.

37:27.719 --> 37:29.619
I have to go forward.

37:29.655 --> 37:31.855
I just have to...

37:33.892 --> 37:37.627
So no, I don't think we
should get back together.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.867
Okay.

37:45.564 --> 37:46.736
Uh...

37:48.206 --> 37:49.573
Is it that Mitch guy?

37:49.608 --> 37:51.775
No. This isn't about Mitch.

37:52.945 --> 37:55.244
And this isn't about Sylvia either.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.813
This is about me.

37:59.284 --> 38:02.618
I'm not worried about the
girls as I used to be.

38:02.653 --> 38:04.720
We're gonna be great parents to them.

38:04.755 --> 38:08.691
And they are gonna be
fine and happy and...

38:09.911 --> 38:13.696
But, all this time,
I've been looking out for the girls,

38:14.647 --> 38:17.366
and now I have to look out for me.

38:17.401 --> 38:19.602
And figure out what it
is that makes me happy.

38:19.637 --> 38:23.405
Because I don't even know anymore.

38:26.210 --> 38:29.795
Okay. I should go.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.946
No. No. No. Please. Stay.

38:35.319 --> 38:38.286
Look, I'm-I'm not gonna
forget about your offer.

38:38.322 --> 38:41.156
And I will always love you.

38:42.395 --> 38:44.453
I just... I can't do this.

38:46.169 --> 38:48.229
Not right now.

38:49.296 --> 38:50.470
Okay.

38:54.037 --> 38:55.403
Okay.

39:07.016 --> 39:08.882
There we go.

39:08.918 --> 39:11.085
All right.
That should warm this place up a bit.

39:12.074 --> 39:14.422
Hey. I forgot something in the truck.

39:14.457 --> 39:15.989
Can you keep an eye on this for me?

39:16.025 --> 39:18.992
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

39:40.319 --> 39:42.248
I could tell by the look on Peter's face

39:42.284 --> 39:44.264
what your decision was.

39:45.095 --> 39:46.837
I'm sorry.

39:47.522 --> 39:49.321
Don't be, Lou.

39:51.522 --> 39:53.492
I trust you.

39:54.929 --> 39:56.963
You and Peter will handle this.

39:58.844 --> 40:00.994
So will you and Casey.

40:03.972 --> 40:06.004
So you know?

40:06.039 --> 40:07.806
Everyone knows.

40:07.841 --> 40:09.274
I mean, why else wouldn't Casey have be

40:09.310 --> 40:10.709
at our New Years eve dinner?

40:10.744 --> 40:12.677
We took a break.

40:13.315 --> 40:14.542
My idea.

40:15.949 --> 40:17.416
I don't know if it was
the right one or not.

40:17.451 --> 40:20.319
But I'm the one who opened
my mouth and suggested it.

40:20.354 --> 40:22.186
And she didn't disagree so...

40:23.202 --> 40:24.990
We haven't talked since.

40:26.660 --> 40:28.059
I'm sorry.

40:30.163 --> 40:33.177
You weren't trying to get
Peter and I back together

40:33.296 --> 40:37.068
because you and Casey couldn't
make a go of it, were you?

40:43.743 --> 40:46.076
I just want you to be happy, Lou.

40:47.415 --> 40:49.980
I want you to be happy too, dad.

40:51.491 --> 40:54.518
All right! Who wants some bubbly?

40:54.553 --> 40:56.319
Come on, where's Jack? Oh!

40:57.472 --> 40:59.156
Everyone you gotta come outside.

40:59.191 --> 41:00.858
Bring the glasses.

41:00.893 --> 41:03.994
- You won't believe it!
- What?

41:05.397 --> 41:07.881
What took you so long,
you were gone forever.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.303
Happy anniversary.

41:13.338 --> 41:16.353
- Oh Ty! No way!
- Yeah!

41:16.908 --> 41:19.776
Monty! You look so cute!

41:21.213 --> 41:23.012
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:23.048 --> 41:24.414
Oh...

41:32.924 --> 41:34.791
Oh wow.

41:47.771 --> 41:49.471
Look at that...

41:49.507 --> 41:51.340
Happy New Year!

41:51.375 --> 41:53.442
Happy New Year!

41:53.477 --> 41:54.776
Cheers!!

41:54.812 --> 41:56.212
Happy New Year!

42:00.150 --> 42:01.482
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.

42:10.627 --> 42:12.260
Adam! You gotta to see this!

42:37.854 --> 42:41.583
♪ And waters pacing
over rivers edge ♪

42:42.125 --> 42:43.490
Oh wow!

42:44.961 --> 42:46.827
Just for us.

42:49.465 --> 42:51.598
Happy anniversary.

43:00.576 --> 43:02.342
I have a gift for you too.

43:04.246 --> 43:06.212
- You do?
- I do.

43:06.248 --> 43:08.148
What have you got?

43:09.130 --> 43:10.950
You're going to be a father.

43:12.486 --> 43:13.852
What?

43:13.888 --> 43:15.353
Amy...?

43:22.129 --> 43:23.495
Really?

43:23.530 --> 43:24.897
Wow!
