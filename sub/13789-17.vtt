WEBVTT

00:05.296 --> 00:08.129
Come on, Gracie and Freddy,
say, "Da-Da."

00:08.129 --> 00:10.931
Say "Avery."

00:10.931 --> 00:14.135
Say...(British accent)
"Now is the winter
of our discontent,

00:14.135 --> 00:18.059
made glorious summer
by this son of York."

00:18.059 --> 00:21.312
Now say, "I'd like to dedicate
this Tony award to my father

00:21.312 --> 00:25.486
who instilled in me
a love of theater
from a very young age."

00:26.947 --> 00:28.739
Stan, you've been trying
to get the puppies

00:28.739 --> 00:30.321
to talk for weeks now.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.073
Are you going to be disappointed
if they never do?

00:32.073 --> 00:34.325
Avery,
these are my children.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.617
I will love them
unconditionally.

00:36.617 --> 00:39.330
If they don't talk,
they'll win the Tony
for lighting design.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.423
Do I want to know?

00:42.423 --> 00:44.044
Wait a minute,
are you just assuming

00:44.044 --> 00:45.426
we came from doing
something ridiculous?

00:45.426 --> 00:47.928
Yes.
Then you'd be correct.

00:47.928 --> 00:50.261
I discovered that Chloe's
a mastermind at coming up

00:50.261 --> 00:52.383
with crazy fun things to do.

00:52.383 --> 00:54.935
Like just now at the park
playing Tic-Tac-Tourist.

00:58.179 --> 01:00.641
Just stand here.
After we're done,

01:00.641 --> 01:02.393
the winning team
gets to buy lunch

01:02.393 --> 01:05.316
for Hollywood's
latest teen heart-throb.

01:07.238 --> 01:09.650
Yeah, I'm better-looking
in person.

01:11.322 --> 01:14.905
Tyler, if you want a sister
with ideas for fun things to do,

01:14.905 --> 01:16.827
there's a walking tour
of the Botanical Gardens that--

01:16.827 --> 01:18.999
Okay, never mind.

01:18.999 --> 01:21.162
There's an Ernst Lubitsch
marathon at the--

01:21.162 --> 01:23.254
Moving on.

01:23.254 --> 01:25.546
Oh! The Getty Museum
has a new tapestry exhibit.

01:25.546 --> 01:28.709
Why am I still talking?

01:28.709 --> 01:31.212
If you want fun things to do,
you can play with the puppies.

01:31.212 --> 01:32.843
True, they're not
very interesting yet.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.515
All they do right now
is eat, sleep, and--

01:34.515 --> 01:37.428
Da-Da.
--sometimes like
to bounce on a pillow.

01:37.428 --> 01:38.809
Ahhh! Gracie talked!

01:38.809 --> 01:40.431
Gracie talked!

01:40.431 --> 01:41.642
Oh, my goodness!

01:41.642 --> 01:43.854
This is amazing!
I can't believe it.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.146
Da-Da.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.857
How do you guys deal
with this?

01:46.857 --> 01:50.151
It's a little freaky
seeing words come out
of a dog's mouth.

02:08.339 --> 02:11.131
There's finally another
talking dog in the world--

02:11.131 --> 02:13.013
and it's my own daughter!

02:13.013 --> 02:15.095
Although
when she becomes a teenager

02:15.095 --> 02:18.599
and starts to talk back to me,
I might not be so excited.

02:18.599 --> 02:20.221
Listen, young lady,

02:20.221 --> 02:21.852
I don't care
if it is a full moon,

02:21.852 --> 02:24.104
11 o'clock means 11 o'clock.

02:24.104 --> 02:25.476
If you wanted to be nocturnal,

02:25.476 --> 02:27.398
you should've been
born a possum.

02:27.398 --> 02:30.731
You're dating one?!
Oh, where did I go wrong?

02:32.533 --> 02:35.035
But even before
that challenge arises,

02:35.035 --> 02:38.279
there was one other little
problem we had to deal with...

02:38.279 --> 02:39.370
( cheering )

02:39.370 --> 02:41.242
I can't believe
Gracie can talk.

02:41.242 --> 02:42.413
I knew she could do it!

02:42.413 --> 02:43.874
Figures it's the girl.

02:43.874 --> 02:47.418
Wait. What if someone else
hears Gracie talking?

02:47.418 --> 02:48.709
( scratching )

02:48.709 --> 02:50.501
Freddy!
Get off that turntable.

02:53.424 --> 02:56.257
Stan, what's my DJ equipment
doing in the kitchen?

02:56.257 --> 02:58.058
It's not in the kitchen.

02:58.058 --> 03:01.852
It's in Pasadena's hottest
new club -- Kitchen.

03:01.852 --> 03:03.974
( dance music playing )

03:05.606 --> 03:08.899
Hollywood's latest teen
heart-throb's at my club!

03:08.899 --> 03:11.522
This is gonna be great
for business.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.235
Guys.

03:14.235 --> 03:17.368
Guys!
( music stops )

03:17.368 --> 03:19.580
As much as I want to know
how you did all this,

03:19.580 --> 03:23.284
and ask why you didn't do it
for my birthday party...

03:23.284 --> 03:25.326
we have a bigger problem.

03:25.326 --> 03:26.917
Gracie is talking.

03:26.917 --> 03:28.419
If anyone sees her,

03:28.419 --> 03:30.331
she'll be taken away
and experimented on.

03:30.331 --> 03:31.462
Just like with me.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.504
Great. Now we have another
secret to keep.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.296
And it'll be
even harder this time

03:35.296 --> 03:37.298
since Gracie
isn't old enough to realize

03:37.298 --> 03:39.390
she can't talk in front
of anyone but us.

03:39.390 --> 03:40.391
Well, until she learns,

03:40.391 --> 03:42.683
I will not take
my eyes off my puppies.

03:42.683 --> 03:46.477
I will be diligent,
I will be vigilant, I will be--

03:46.477 --> 03:48.519
( snoring )

03:55.486 --> 03:57.197
I like talking to you.

03:57.197 --> 03:59.410
You always listen.
Plus, it helps you grow.

04:01.322 --> 04:02.953
And I like playing
with you because

04:02.953 --> 04:04.325
I'm tired of the kids
always beating me.

04:07.077 --> 04:09.330
Oh, come on!

04:09.330 --> 04:10.671
Da-Da.

04:10.671 --> 04:13.043
No, no, sweetie,
it's "Ma-Ma."

04:13.043 --> 04:14.545
Wait, what?!

04:14.545 --> 04:16.877
Did you hear that?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.684
Bennett, you'll never guess
what happened.

04:23.684 --> 04:25.766
A husband working
from home

04:25.766 --> 04:27.227
unsuccessfully
tried to get coffee

04:27.227 --> 04:29.770
without being ambushed
by his wife?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.652
No, that's what's happening.

04:31.652 --> 04:33.564
I'm talking about
what happened.

04:34.855 --> 04:36.567
A minute ago on the patio,

04:36.567 --> 04:39.660
Gracie made a sound that
sounded exactly like "Da-Da."

04:39.660 --> 04:41.532
Ellen, that's not
that strange.

04:41.532 --> 04:44.365
The Internet is full
of videos of dogs barking

04:44.365 --> 04:46.327
in ways that
sound like words.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.038
There's a corgi in Texas

04:48.038 --> 04:51.832
whose bark sounds like
"Howdy, y'all!"

04:51.832 --> 04:54.004
Sure, it's a regional
stereotype,

04:54.004 --> 04:55.586
but it's still adorable.

04:56.877 --> 04:59.259
No, you have to hear this.

04:59.259 --> 05:01.051
Come on,
do it again, Gracie.

05:04.184 --> 05:05.346
Yeah.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.187
Look, I have
to get back to work.

05:07.187 --> 05:08.849
But tonight after dinner,

05:08.849 --> 05:11.642
let's talk about
a hobby for you, hmm?

05:11.642 --> 05:15.566
Ugh. And maybe talk about
getting a new coffee pot.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.321
Gracie,
you're making me look bad.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.283
Da-Da.
Dang it!

05:25.075 --> 05:26.206
She did it again.

05:26.206 --> 05:27.948
She barked "Da-Da."
Listen.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.953
I swear, the bark sounded
like someone talking.

05:32.953 --> 05:35.255
Have you ever heard
of something that sounds
like a person

05:35.255 --> 05:37.548
but with no human
intelligence behind it?

05:45.345 --> 05:48.268
Come on, Gracie,
work with me.

05:48.268 --> 05:50.310
Da-Da.
Seriously?!

05:53.394 --> 05:56.276
The dog talks.
The dog talks!

05:59.359 --> 06:03.283
I also see adult patients
from time to time.

06:06.987 --> 06:09.910
Since you'll only sound like
a person in front of me,

06:09.910 --> 06:11.992
I'm gonna get you on video
to show Bennett

06:11.992 --> 06:13.794
I'm not imagining things.

06:13.794 --> 06:16.837
Okay, tour group
that was Kitchen,

06:16.837 --> 06:20.000
the hottest
new club in Pasadena.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.341
Now who wants to
clean the room

06:21.341 --> 06:23.133
of Hollywood's latest
teen heart-throb?

06:26.507 --> 06:28.559
Well, at least his room
is getting cleaned.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.513
I got you a treat,
yes, I did,

06:32.513 --> 06:35.566
but you gotta earn it.
Say, "Da-Da."

06:35.566 --> 06:39.149
Like this: "Da-Da."
"Ooh, good job, Ellen!"

06:41.862 --> 06:44.194
This is surprisingly tasty.

06:44.194 --> 06:46.447
Chicken and salmon together.
I would not have thought.

06:48.238 --> 06:49.289
And it cleans my teeth?

06:51.291 --> 06:53.954
Ahh, you're not gonna do it,
are you?

06:53.954 --> 06:55.706
That's it. I give up.

06:57.748 --> 07:00.210
Da-Da.
Yes!

07:00.210 --> 07:02.342
I knew if I hung in there
long enough, you'd do it!

07:02.342 --> 07:05.255
The puppy talks!
The puppy talks!

07:06.256 --> 07:07.307
Mama's not crazy.

07:07.307 --> 07:08.428
Mama's not crazy.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.890
Ooh! Get outta my shot.

07:11.011 --> 07:14.394
( beatboxing )

07:14.394 --> 07:15.516
( "scratching" )

07:15.516 --> 07:17.317
( beatboxing )

07:20.440 --> 07:22.863
Well, Stan,
did you manage

07:22.863 --> 07:24.655
to keep the puppies away
from Mom and Dad?

07:24.655 --> 07:27.407
Relax, Avery.
Everything went great.

07:27.407 --> 07:29.029
Gracie got away at one point,

07:29.029 --> 07:31.031
but I'm pretty sure
no damage was done.

07:31.031 --> 07:33.624
Hey, Avery,
your mom heard Gracie speak.

07:33.624 --> 07:35.626
Ahhhh!

07:35.626 --> 07:38.418
No, no, no, sweetie.
Dogs can't really talk.

07:38.418 --> 07:40.210
It's just a weird bark
that makes it

07:40.210 --> 07:41.792
sound like
the dog is talking.

07:41.792 --> 07:44.424
Whew!
Ahhhh!

07:44.424 --> 07:47.007
See?
Stan has a weird bark, too.

07:47.007 --> 07:49.089
Whew!

07:49.089 --> 07:51.221
The funny part is,
your mom made a video

07:51.221 --> 07:54.354
of Gracie barking "Da-Da"
and put it on the Internet.

07:54.354 --> 07:56.016
Ahhh!

07:56.016 --> 07:57.267
I know, right?

07:57.267 --> 07:59.269
I was pretty shocked
that your mom knew

07:59.269 --> 08:02.312
how to post anything
to the Internet, too.

08:02.312 --> 08:05.736
STAN: Tell me about it.
My wife can't even set the DVR.

08:09.279 --> 08:10.781
( Ellen beatboxing
on video )

08:14.955 --> 08:18.168
Wow! Your mother really knows
how to kick it old school.

08:20.420 --> 08:23.423
Well, the video has only
received 37 hits,

08:23.423 --> 08:25.125
so it hasn't gone viral.

08:25.125 --> 08:28.388
And the good news is
all the comments say "fake."

08:28.388 --> 08:30.390
Except for this one comment by

08:30.390 --> 08:33.894
DrBennettJamesPhD1234,

08:33.894 --> 08:36.226
which says "first."

08:41.101 --> 08:43.483
Oh, you're checking out
that video Mom posted?

08:43.483 --> 08:45.145
I can't believe
Dad wrote "first."

08:45.145 --> 08:46.907
He was, like, tenth.

08:46.907 --> 08:49.029
I don't think
he knows what that means.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.741
Do I want to know?

08:50.741 --> 08:52.282
Wait a minute.
Are you just assuming

08:52.282 --> 08:54.284
we came back from doing
something ridiculous?

08:54.284 --> 08:56.577
This time you're wearing
gorilla costumes!

08:57.578 --> 08:59.870
You are observant.

09:01.371 --> 09:03.754
Chloe came up with
another crazy fun thing to do.

09:03.754 --> 09:06.256
We ran through the zoo
like we just escaped.

09:06.256 --> 09:08.839
And next time we're gonna
try it in these costumes.

09:10.340 --> 09:12.302
Well, while you guys
were buying bananas

09:12.302 --> 09:13.844
at the grocery store
in those costumes--

09:13.844 --> 09:15.015
How'd you know?

09:15.015 --> 09:16.767
Well, that's what
I would've done.

09:16.767 --> 09:18.769
So while you guys
were doing that

09:18.769 --> 09:21.812
I was very effectively teaching
Gracie how to be quiet.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.443
Quiet.
Oh, my gosh,

09:23.443 --> 09:25.315
I just taught her
another word!

09:25.315 --> 09:26.687
I'm such a fool!

09:26.687 --> 09:28.649
Quiet, fool.

09:29.990 --> 09:31.281
This is bad.

09:31.281 --> 09:33.243
Now people can't
write off "Da-Da"

09:33.243 --> 09:35.575
as a weird bark if they
hear her say other stuff.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.537
Can you get Gracie
to stop talking, Stan?

09:37.537 --> 09:39.960
I've tried,
but she doesn't understand.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.041
Quiet, fool.

09:41.041 --> 09:42.793
She understands
how to be sassy.

09:45.005 --> 09:47.377
Now we really to have
to keep Gracie away from people.

09:47.377 --> 09:49.880
Kids, I have big news.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.551
News so big
I'm going to ignore the fact

09:51.551 --> 09:53.383
that you are apparently
monkeying around without me.

09:53.383 --> 09:55.425
Ha ha! Good one, Ell--
No! No time.

09:57.557 --> 09:58.929
Graham Cavanaugh,

09:58.929 --> 10:00.811
host of Night Night
with Graham Cavanaugh,

10:00.811 --> 10:04.224
saw my video with Gracie
and wants us on his show.

10:04.224 --> 10:05.776
Graham's producer said that

10:05.776 --> 10:07.227
even though
there are lots of videos

10:07.227 --> 10:09.359
where it sounds like
dogs are talking,

10:09.359 --> 10:11.191
what really drew
them to mine

10:11.191 --> 10:12.653
was that they also thought
I was funny.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.494
Isn't that great, guys?

10:14.494 --> 10:16.997
Millions of people
watch Graham's show!

10:16.997 --> 10:19.409
Millions of people
are gonna see Gracie?

10:19.409 --> 10:20.871
Yeah, yeah.
Her, too.

10:26.546 --> 10:28.669
Guys, your mom and Gracie
are gonna be on

10:28.669 --> 10:30.420
Night Night
with Graham Cavanaugh.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.172
This is terrible.

10:32.172 --> 10:34.845
Since it's about my puppies,
I'm gonna take over here.

10:34.845 --> 10:36.386
We need a plan!

10:36.386 --> 10:39.219
We need a plan so crazy
it just might work.

10:39.219 --> 10:40.681
This plan should be very smart.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.562
Come on, Avery.
Everyone else is contributing.

10:42.562 --> 10:44.644
What's wrong with you?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.977
I'm trying to think
of an actual plan

10:46.977 --> 10:48.478
instead of just saying stuff.

10:48.478 --> 10:51.321
Some people help.
Some people just make excuses.

10:53.033 --> 10:55.655
Some people just make excuses.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.038
Boy, that could get
really annoying

10:58.038 --> 11:02.162
if she starts repeating
everything we say.

11:04.204 --> 11:07.958
You're right, Gracie,
that was a hacky set-up.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.380
Hacky? That's it.

11:10.380 --> 11:13.633
What if Mom does her comedy?

11:13.633 --> 11:15.635
We'll encourage
her to steal the show

11:15.635 --> 11:17.928
and take all the attention
away from Gracie

11:17.928 --> 11:20.470
so Gracie will never
have a chance to say
anything on camera.

11:20.470 --> 11:23.764
The producers did tell Mom
she was funny for some reason.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.107
Good plan, Tyler.

11:27.107 --> 11:28.308
I came up with the plan.

11:28.308 --> 11:29.860
Hmm, I don't remember it
that way.

11:31.311 --> 11:35.695
Starts repeating
everything we say.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.577
Timing.

11:41.411 --> 11:44.164
This is pretty
exciting, hon.

11:44.164 --> 11:45.625
The only time
I've been on TV is

11:45.625 --> 11:48.879
when I was on the Kiss Cam
at a baseball game.

11:48.879 --> 11:52.672
Unfortunately, I was right
next to the San Diego Chicken.

11:52.672 --> 11:54.885
I was spitting feathers
till the fifth inning.

11:56.927 --> 11:58.298
Ellen Jennings?

11:58.298 --> 12:00.720
I'm Leslie Lindemulder,
producer.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.553
Welcome to Night Night.
I see you brought your family.

12:03.553 --> 12:05.766
All of them.
Including an additional dog.

12:05.766 --> 12:06.807
Wonderful.

12:08.348 --> 12:09.519
You know, I've always
wanted to be on TV,

12:09.519 --> 12:11.231
because as a child,

12:11.231 --> 12:14.064
I was denied watching it
in favor of marionette shows.

12:14.064 --> 12:15.275
Little known fact about me,

12:15.275 --> 12:17.317
I was raised
by bitter puppeteers.

12:19.359 --> 12:20.821
I'll be right back.

12:20.821 --> 12:23.033
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie
brought their kids.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.915
They ate all the candy
in the green room,

12:24.915 --> 12:26.827
and now they're somewhere
in the duct work.

12:28.328 --> 12:33.293
Did you say "duct work"
or "duck work?"

12:33.293 --> 12:35.635
Because I'm known
for my duck work.

12:35.635 --> 12:39.509
( quacking )

12:39.509 --> 12:42.142
They're so adorable
at this age, aren't they?

12:44.434 --> 12:47.647
You know, this could be
a big night for you, Mom.

12:47.647 --> 12:49.559
A lot of famous careers
have started out

12:49.559 --> 12:51.021
on late night television.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.063
Remember,
you do all the talking.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.394
No one wants to hear
a dog talk.

12:54.394 --> 12:56.356
They want to hear you.

12:56.356 --> 12:59.449
Look at her being all cute,
trying to steal your thunder.

12:59.449 --> 13:02.452
She is, isn't she?

13:02.452 --> 13:04.704
It is time
for the world to discover

13:04.704 --> 13:06.706
what we've always known--

13:06.706 --> 13:09.499
you are smart,
funny, talented--

13:09.499 --> 13:12.252
Why does your breath
smell like chicken and salmon?

13:14.254 --> 13:15.505
You know, maybe I could
talk to Graham

13:15.505 --> 13:18.418
about all the viral videos
I've starred in.

13:18.418 --> 13:20.470
My Donkey Laugh Lady commercial,

13:20.470 --> 13:23.053
that Halloween
I got so scared
I fear puked,

13:23.053 --> 13:24.634
"Linguini Limbs."

13:24.634 --> 13:26.516
Linguini Limbs?

13:33.023 --> 13:34.314
I'm a star.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.317
A big, hot,
gassy ball of wonderful.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.821
Wait, you put
Linguine Limbs online?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.944
Yeah.
Oh!

13:43.944 --> 13:46.536
"First."
You are not first!

13:48.038 --> 13:49.409
All righty.

13:49.409 --> 13:51.831
I got those Jolie-Pitt
kids get out of the ducts.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.294
I promised them they
could braid my hair.

13:54.294 --> 13:56.006
Now my Saturday's all set.

13:57.257 --> 13:59.669
Speaking of kids,

13:59.669 --> 14:03.383
I'm a renowned
child psychologist and author.

14:03.383 --> 14:04.885
If you need
an additional guest,

14:04.885 --> 14:07.017
I brought a copy
of my book to plug.

14:07.017 --> 14:08.388
That won't be necessary.

14:08.388 --> 14:10.810
Don't you think this would
look good in Graham's hands

14:10.810 --> 14:14.234
as he points it towards,
I believe, camera two?

14:15.395 --> 14:17.237
We definitely have
a spot for this.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.611
Now let's go get you ready.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.033
Okay.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.537
If your mom becomes
a famous comedienne after this

14:27.537 --> 14:29.449
and gets her own
sitcom about a talking dog,

14:29.449 --> 14:31.701
I better get to audition--

14:31.701 --> 14:34.084
as the wacky neighbor.

14:34.084 --> 14:37.417
"Whoa, Ellen!
You have a talking dog?"

14:42.302 --> 14:45.175
My next guests
are a homemaker and a puppy

14:45.175 --> 14:47.177
who have captured the hearts
of at least...

14:47.177 --> 14:49.679
200 people on the Internet.

14:49.679 --> 14:51.181
But tonight,
they'll be introduced

14:51.181 --> 14:53.723
to two million people.

14:53.723 --> 14:55.725
Wait, who does
Jon Stewart have on?

14:56.937 --> 14:58.518
Someone from the U.N.?

14:58.518 --> 15:01.731
Four million people!

15:01.731 --> 15:04.654
All right, please welcome
Ellen Jennings and Gracie!

15:04.654 --> 15:07.447
( cheers and applause )

15:07.447 --> 15:09.079
Hey! Right over here.

15:10.530 --> 15:13.413
That puppy
has the cutest little face.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.624
Oh, really?

15:14.624 --> 15:16.376
Yeah. Hmm.
Okay, then.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.423
Anyway,
I've prepared a routine
I'd like to do right now.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.425
I was kind of hoping
to hear the puppy talk,

15:25.425 --> 15:27.547
and not from that end.

15:27.547 --> 15:30.310
Great, thanks.
Cameraman, follow me.

15:31.391 --> 15:32.852
It's working.

15:32.852 --> 15:34.604
Mom is taking
all the attention
away from Gracie.

15:36.106 --> 15:37.817
Chloe!

15:37.817 --> 15:40.440
What? We hear Mommy's jokes
all the time.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.902
Fine.

15:44.404 --> 15:46.486
Can't believe
I'm on national TV.

15:46.486 --> 15:49.909
I always thought
it was a remote possibility.

15:49.909 --> 15:51.281
Ha ha! Good one, Ell--

15:52.622 --> 15:54.454
El-- Oh, no!

15:56.876 --> 15:58.748
Her own stomach
is heckling her.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.172
Mom, are you about
to fear puke?

16:02.172 --> 16:03.423
Of course not.

16:03.423 --> 16:04.964
Fear puke is for
when you see scary things

16:04.964 --> 16:07.887
like ghosts, monsters,
carnival folk.

16:07.887 --> 16:09.929
I'm about to stage puke.

16:09.929 --> 16:12.262
Stage puke?
I thought you did
community theater.

16:12.262 --> 16:15.185
Yes, and the first four rows
were considered a splash zone.

16:15.185 --> 16:16.436
Now out of my way!

16:17.897 --> 16:19.359
( Ellen retching )

16:19.359 --> 16:22.102
ELLEN: Oh, is that
seafood platter
for everyone?

16:23.233 --> 16:26.106
Well, I'm glad
we kept her mic on.

16:26.106 --> 16:29.869
So, Gracie, your turn.

16:29.869 --> 16:32.072
I mean to talk, not to hork

16:32.072 --> 16:34.744
like my ex-girlfriend
after I proposed to her.

16:34.744 --> 16:38.208
It wasn't me, it was
the undercooked tenderloin.

16:38.208 --> 16:40.380
But yes, she left me
and I'm lonely.

16:41.961 --> 16:44.384
Oh, no.
Gracie is gonna speak.

16:44.384 --> 16:46.296
We have to get out there
and distract Graham.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.428
Doing what?
I don't know.

16:49.839 --> 16:52.342
Come on, pup, say "Da-Da"

16:52.342 --> 16:54.844
like in the video.

16:54.844 --> 16:58.398
Or say, "This segment seemed
like a good idea at the time."

16:59.939 --> 17:01.231
Graham, over here!

17:01.231 --> 17:03.523
Hey! Who are you?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.024
I'm the horker's daughter.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.276
Sorry about
your ex-girlfriend.

17:06.276 --> 17:07.947
You're a great guy,
you're gonna find somebody.

17:07.947 --> 17:09.149
I have my own talent.

17:11.571 --> 17:13.032
( joints crack )

17:13.032 --> 17:14.324
Ohhh! That's unnatural.

17:15.655 --> 17:18.118
I'm her brother.
I have a talent, too.

17:18.118 --> 17:19.419
Is it being a security guard?

17:19.419 --> 17:22.122
'Cause apparently
we don't have any of those.

17:23.833 --> 17:26.256
Nope, I'm a professional
BMX rider.

17:26.256 --> 17:27.967
But I don't have my bike here,

17:27.967 --> 17:29.549
so you'll have to use
your imagination.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.132
Wheelie!

17:32.132 --> 17:33.803
Bell: "Bling-bling!"

17:33.803 --> 17:35.805
Whooo!

17:35.805 --> 17:38.438
If you're just tuning in
from another show, go back.

17:38.438 --> 17:40.600
Go back.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.312
Who are you?!

17:42.312 --> 17:44.144
Dr. Bennett James,

17:44.144 --> 17:46.606
world renowned child
psychologist and author.

17:46.606 --> 17:48.188
If you need to get a handle on

17:48.188 --> 17:49.949
out of control kids--
Dad, watch out!!!

17:51.991 --> 17:53.573
Hi! I believe...

17:53.573 --> 17:55.365
camera two?

17:57.197 --> 17:59.409
Okay, everyone
get off the stage.

17:59.409 --> 18:01.201
Let's give Mr. Cavanaugh
his show back.

18:01.201 --> 18:03.413
Kids, we need to go.

18:03.413 --> 18:05.084
Parenting expert.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.587
Yeah, you're doing
a bang-up job.

18:09.259 --> 18:10.510
Okay, I'm back.

18:10.510 --> 18:12.672
As I was saying before,
my name is El--

18:12.672 --> 18:15.885
Oh, boy, still a little
left in the basement.

18:18.388 --> 18:22.061
Okay, let's hear this
puppy say one word.

18:22.061 --> 18:24.434
This is it, Tyler.
I can't watch.

18:24.434 --> 18:27.026
I wonder if my online
sales have spiked yet.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.693
CHLOE: And we finish
your week-long

18:33.693 --> 18:38.618
celebrity tour
at the set of Night Night
with Graham Cavanaugh.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.912
( repeating in Spanish )

18:42.912 --> 18:44.794
...Night Night
with Graham Cavanaugh.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.298
Before we run out
of time, Gracie,

18:48.298 --> 18:50.300
this is your last chance
to say something.

18:50.300 --> 18:53.803
There's Graham Cavanaugh!
Go get an autograph!

18:56.216 --> 18:58.598
STAN: Oh. Guess I didn't have
to do a high dive

18:58.598 --> 19:00.059
into a glass of water
after all.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.353
Well, that's all the time
we have, folks.

19:03.353 --> 19:05.315
Everyone's fired, including me.

19:05.315 --> 19:06.476
Goodnight!

19:08.228 --> 19:10.149
And we're clear.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.902
And now that we're both fired,
we can finally be together.

19:14.113 --> 19:15.905
I was joking
about being fired.

19:20.490 --> 19:22.121
So, how'd I do?

19:27.547 --> 19:29.339
GRAHAM: That's all the time
we have, folks.

19:29.339 --> 19:31.711
Everyone's fired, including me.
Goodnight!

19:31.711 --> 19:34.294
Well, that turned out
as well as I remembered it.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.177
Too bad they never got
to see Gracie talk.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.349
Oh, what a shame.
Big loss.

19:39.349 --> 19:41.301
Our plan worked.

19:42.562 --> 19:44.304
Honey,
it has been a long day.

19:44.304 --> 19:47.897
Let's get you into bed
for some much needed rest.

19:47.897 --> 19:50.440
Well, since they ran out of time
before I got to do my thing,

19:50.440 --> 19:51.731
do you think they want to
have me back tomorrow?

19:51.731 --> 19:53.403
Your picture is up
at the security desk.

19:53.403 --> 19:54.944
Oh, should I go sign it?

19:56.986 --> 19:59.279
I can't believe we managed
to take over the show

19:59.279 --> 20:01.160
enough to keep
Gracie's secret safe.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.122
I can't believe any
of what happened, happened.

20:03.122 --> 20:05.285
I can't believe
I speak Spanish.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.288
You study it at school.

20:08.288 --> 20:10.710
Not very hard.

20:10.710 --> 20:14.294
Gracie, you can't talk
in front of anyone except us.

20:14.294 --> 20:17.547
It means so much to me
that I'm gonna be able
to talk to my daughter.

20:17.547 --> 20:20.890
It's just, I love you
and I don't want anything
to happen to you.

20:20.890 --> 20:22.392
Okay, Da-Da.

20:23.803 --> 20:25.345
I think she gets it.

20:25.345 --> 20:27.106
Dogs develop faster
than people.

20:27.106 --> 20:28.348
Maybe she's at a point

20:28.348 --> 20:29.729
where she's finally
able to understand.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.230
All our worries are over.

20:35.355 --> 20:38.528
He's gonna be a handful.
At least he can't talk.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.410
There's the sugar.

20:42.121 --> 20:44.163
Quiet, fool.

20:44.163 --> 20:47.997
STAN: Avery was right--
Gracie did get it.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.330
And soon, Freddy will too.

20:50.330 --> 20:54.003
Not that it's gonna be easy.
Sometimes even I slip up.

20:54.003 --> 20:57.136
So keeping the secret's always
gonna be a challenge.

20:57.136 --> 20:59.719
Although someday
everyone's gonna know,

20:59.719 --> 21:03.803
when Ellen gets her sitcom
and I play the wacky neighbor.

21:03.803 --> 21:06.346
♪ Good one, Ellen! ♪
( TV theme music plays )

21:06.346 --> 21:10.440
( studio audience cheering )

21:10.440 --> 21:12.231
I'm ho-o-ome!

21:14.273 --> 21:15.815
It's about time!

21:15.815 --> 21:18.027
Where's my kibble?!

21:20.109 --> 21:23.403
So, Ellen,
I need to go to
my high school reunion.

21:23.403 --> 21:25.615
Will you pretend
to be my wife?

21:25.615 --> 21:27.246
AUDIENCE: Whoooo!

21:27.246 --> 21:29.959
I don't think
you should do that, Ellen.

21:29.959 --> 21:33.172
Whoa, Ellen!
You have a talking dog?

21:34.754 --> 21:38.418
You could say
he's my "pet project."

21:38.418 --> 21:40.219
Ha ha! Good one, Ellen!

21:42.221 --> 21:46.556
People will watch anything...
if it's well cast.

21:49.479 --> 21:50.480
