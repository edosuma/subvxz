<i> ["The Ballad Of</i>
    <i> Gilligan's Island"]</i>

00:03.469 --> 00:05.103
¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.172 --> 00:07.338
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:07.407 --> 00:09.374
¶ That started from
      this tropic port ¶

00:09.442 --> 00:11.776
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:11.845 --> 00:14.345
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:14.414 --> 00:16.548
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:16.617 --> 00:19.017
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:19.085 --> 00:21.219
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:21.288 --> 00:24.055
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:24.124 --> 00:25.557
[thunder rumbling]

00:25.626 --> 00:28.226
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:28.295 --> 00:30.629
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:30.697 --> 00:33.098
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:33.167 --> 00:35.200
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:35.269 --> 00:37.469
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:37.538 --> 00:39.504
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore ¶

00:39.573 --> 00:42.407
¶ Of this uncharted
      desert isle ¶

00:42.476 --> 00:44.976
¶ With Gilligan ¶

00:45.045 --> 00:47.111
¶ The Skipper too ¶

00:47.180 --> 00:49.214
¶ The millionaire ¶

00:49.283 --> 00:51.783
¶ And his wife ¶

00:51.852 --> 00:54.619
¶ The movie star ¶

00:54.688 --> 00:56.254
¶ And the rest ¶

00:56.323 --> 01:00.626
¶ Are here on Gilligan's isle ¶

01:19.546 --> 01:22.714
Major, Operation Powderkeg
is ready for the final phase.

01:22.782 --> 01:23.949
Yes, sir.

01:24.017 --> 01:27.152
Now, we'll learn exactly
what that new warhead will do.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.721
It's to be tested down
the South Sea Missile Range.

01:29.789 --> 01:33.625
We found the perfect place.
No habitation, no people.

01:37.698 --> 01:38.997
'That's wonderful, sir''

01:39.066 --> 01:41.100
'I'll release an announcement to
the press and radio stations.'

01:50.477 --> 01:53.044
Here, Skipper.
  Here's the pole you wanted.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.380
Thanks a lot, Gilligan.

01:55.448 --> 01:58.383
"X" marks the spot.
This is where it will go up.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.252
- Oh.
             - Ow!

02:01.321 --> 02:02.721
Not that. The play room.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.656
Yeah. It's
           a good idea, Skipper.

02:04.724 --> 02:06.858
If we're gonna be stuck here
we might as well have fun.

02:06.927 --> 02:10.027
Certainly, that's why I
 suggested we build a play room.

02:10.097 --> 02:13.031
A nice big one. May as well
     make the island nice.

02:13.099 --> 02:14.366
Can we have a dance?

02:14.434 --> 02:16.201
Well, that's not too good
       a suggestion.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.537
We're only three women and four
 men. It might cause trouble.

02:19.606 --> 02:20.973
No, that's okay
nowadays, Skipper.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.174
They don't dance in couples,
they just choose up sides.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.644
[laughs]

02:25.712 --> 02:27.079
Very good.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.714
Well, now you start
             sawing the poles

02:28.782 --> 02:31.216
and I wanna listen
           to the noon day news.

02:32.452 --> 02:35.587
Oh, uh, do you know
who has the radio?

02:35.656 --> 02:37.155
Uh, oh, yeah,
               Professor has it.

02:37.224 --> 02:39.057
- Thank you.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.659
- No, Mary Ann has it.
     - Ah.

02:41.728 --> 02:42.927
No, no, wait.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.163
Ginger, she has it.

02:45.232 --> 02:48.767
No, no. The Howells,
            they have it.

02:48.836 --> 02:52.503
Gilligan, do you know
who has the radio?

02:52.572 --> 02:53.939
No.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.508
Of course not. Saw.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.651
[dramatic music]

03:09.455 --> 03:10.855
You sent for me, sir?

03:10.924 --> 03:13.291
Did you released the information
on Operation Powderkeg?

03:13.360 --> 03:14.692
Yes, sir, the press
      have been notified

03:14.761 --> 03:16.862
and all radio stations
     in the South Sea area.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.831
Good, judging from
       this latest report

03:19.900 --> 03:22.900
projected power of this
   new warhead is fantastic.

03:22.969 --> 03:25.169
Everything within a radius
   of a hundred miles

03:25.238 --> 03:26.772
will be totally destroyed.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.675
Hi, folks. Have you
seen the radio?

03:30.744 --> 03:32.544
I haven't seen it.
Maybe the girls have it.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.979
Skipper, it's
               very fascinating.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.847
Professor is making
       a mirror for Mrs. Howell.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.616
Maybe he'll make one
      for you too.

03:37.684 --> 03:40.319
Thanks, I'd rather have
the radio not a mirror.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.587
I'm more interested
in good news than bad news.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.922
[laughs]

03:47.694 --> 03:49.827
(man on radio)
    'One, two, three, four.'

03:49.896 --> 03:52.030
'One, two, three, four.'

03:52.099 --> 03:54.132
'One, two, three, four.'

03:54.201 --> 03:56.367
'One, two, three, four.'

03:56.436 --> 03:58.303
'One, two, three, four.'

03:58.372 --> 04:00.304
'One, two, three, four.'

04:00.373 --> 04:02.707
'And now you can rest.'

04:02.776 --> 04:04.276
[sighs]

04:06.179 --> 04:09.247
(Skipper)
 And now, ladies, the next
 exercise is a real tough one.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.116
Deep knee bends.

04:11.185 --> 04:12.783
Ready?

04:12.852 --> 04:13.952
One.

04:23.463 --> 04:24.896
Wonder why he has us
down here so long?

04:24.965 --> 04:26.764
I don't know.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.867
If we'd been doing
       these exercises all along

04:28.935 --> 04:30.535
we'd be in good shape.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.904
I don't see how you exercise
in that dress. It's so tight.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.106
I'm surprised it doesn't
cut off circulation.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.641
Honey, in Hollywood

04:36.709 --> 04:38.744
the tighter the dress,
   the more the girl circulates.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.914
Then, what are you ladies
   doing down there?

04:42.983 --> 04:45.783
- Oh, Skipper.
       - What's going on?

04:45.852 --> 04:47.552
- You turned it off!
      - Oh, Skipper.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.953
I was just having a little fun.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.322
- That wasn't very nice.
    - It certainly wasn't.

04:51.391 --> 04:54.258
(man on radio)
'That was a special news
bulletin from Radio Honolulu..'

04:54.327 --> 04:56.627
[radio static]

04:56.696 --> 04:58.029
What's the matter
               with the radio?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.665
- I don't know.
        - Skipper?

05:05.839 --> 05:09.141
- Radio's gone dead.
      - Dead?

05:09.209 --> 05:10.008
Oh, dear.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.747
Can you tell
    what's wrong, Professor?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.548
Well, nothing
seems to be broken.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.184
I'd say it was the batteries.

05:19.253 --> 05:22.553
Oh, well, without the batteries
 it may as well be broken.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.789
I'm afraid you're right.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.658
There goes our only contact
with civilization.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.731
This is the final authorization
for Operation Powderkeg.

05:32.799 --> 05:34.032
Have you been in touch
with Vandenberg?

05:34.101 --> 05:35.734
Yes, sir, they can get
the warhead installed

05:35.802 --> 05:38.470
the missile ready by tomorrow.
Just need your approval.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.171
- Permission granted.
     - Thank you, sir.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.341
[dramatic music]

05:44.944 --> 05:46.545
[whizzing]

05:51.751 --> 05:53.251
Oh, this is dreadful.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.853
Without the radio how will
  I keep up with the fashion?

05:55.922 --> 05:57.322
I won't know what's
         happening in Hollywood.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.090
- Who's getting married to who?
- Whom.

05:59.158 --> 06:00.725
Now, that's women for you.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.128
One worrying about what
the other women are wearing.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.563
The other one worrying
about whom they're wearing.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.732
- Who.
         - Yeah, yeah.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.801
Darling, you're only interested
 in the stock market.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.036
We women have
       more important interests.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.472
Oh, that's right.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.907
I'll never learn what happened
to the young Dr. Malone.

06:15.975 --> 06:17.776
After he cured Mrs. Tellingham's
baby of measles

06:17.845 --> 06:19.510
'he barely got to the hospital'

06:19.579 --> 06:21.712
in time to set
Peter Pitman's broken arm.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.681
What he didn't realized was
Peter Pitman was dating

06:23.750 --> 06:24.983
his very own girlfriend.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.717
While they were driving
in a convertible

06:26.786 --> 06:29.954
they swerved to avoid hitting
a car driven by widow Watson

06:30.023 --> 06:32.757
who was a dear friend
     of Dr. Malone's father

06:32.826 --> 06:34.693
who was shopping
       for Annabel Hawks.

06:34.762 --> 06:35.927
Well--

06:35.995 --> 06:38.463
Good heavens. That's enough
to drain anyone's battery.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.964
Well, it's the
              batteries alright.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.832
'Cause everything else
  is in perfect working order.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.602
No, the company that makes
those batteries

06:43.670 --> 06:45.937
is a disgrace to the American
free enterprise system.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.406
I mean really, I've got
dozens of companies.

06:48.475 --> 06:50.008
'We make hundreds
    of products like that.'

06:50.076 --> 06:52.577
And you've got to maintain
production standards.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.811
But, Thurston--

06:53.880 --> 06:55.580
There is no excuse
for shoddy workmanship.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.848
Not with testing facilities
the way they are today.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.886
You market something, you've got
to make it with meticulous care

07:00.954 --> 07:03.755
to last and to last
and to last.

07:03.823 --> 07:05.156
But, Thurston, these
      batteries were made

07:05.225 --> 07:07.726
by the Thurston Howell
     Battery Company.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.728
Well, you can't expect them
to last forever, can you?

07:09.796 --> 07:12.998
I'd go out of business.
Lovey, really!

07:17.004 --> 07:19.437
I've got an extra set
of batteries for the radio.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.972
He's got an extra set
           of batteries.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.473
That's great!

07:22.542 --> 07:23.842
- Had them all along.
    - He had them all along.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.510
- Forgot about them.
    - He forgot about them.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.045
Feel like
an absolute idiot.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.814
He feels like,
       he had them all the time.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.949
- All set.
  - Can I turn it on, Skipper?

07:32.018 --> 07:34.152
- Please?
  - Yes, as soon as he gets..

07:34.220 --> 07:36.620
- Yes, go ahead. Turn it on.
  - Turn it on, Gilligan.

07:36.689 --> 07:38.890
Ah, it's on.
                    It's on.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.893
Gilligan, what did you do?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.528
Didn't do anything.
             Just turned it on.

07:43.597 --> 07:46.030
It's not his fault, Skipper.
 These batteries are dead too.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.165
But I never used them.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.934
Batteries can lose power
    just sitting on a shelf.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.036
Hey. Wait a minute,
    Skipper, we're in luck.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.137
Yeah, bad luck.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.873
No, these batteries
      are rechargeable.

07:54.941 --> 07:57.309
Professor, how can we recharge
batteries here on the island?

07:57.377 --> 07:58.776
Don't even have
                 a credit card.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.646
Seawater. I used to do this
experiment in science class.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.915
We use seawater instead
of battery acid to revitalize

08:03.984 --> 08:06.384
old dry cell batteries
and produce electricity.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.986
Seawater? Well,
    what are we waiting for?

08:08.054 --> 08:10.455
We've got enough seawater to
light up all lights on Broadway.

08:10.523 --> 08:11.923
Here's what we'll do.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.493
We need coconut shells,
seawater, metal strips, pennies.

08:15.561 --> 08:17.896
(Professor)
 The pennies are held in
 the seawater by the hairpins.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.297
The wire coming
        from the pennies

08:19.366 --> 08:22.300
leads to the positive pole
   of the battery.

08:22.368 --> 08:24.202
Metal strips on the other side
 of the coconuts

08:24.271 --> 08:26.571
lead to the negative pole
   of the battery.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.674
Now, everybody get ready
    to stir their coconuts

08:29.743 --> 08:32.243
when I get
     the battery hooked up.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.846
Alright.
        Everybody stir.

08:36.383 --> 08:39.116
I wonder if Thomas Edison
       started this way?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.854
Looks like a crazy martini,
     doesn't it?

08:44.258 --> 08:45.423
Alright, that should be enough.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.225
Let's see if we can
      get anything.

08:50.830 --> 08:51.830
[instrumental music]

08:51.898 --> 08:54.399
- Ha, it works!
        - Great! Great!

08:54.467 --> 08:56.501
(Skipper)
     Professor, you did it.
     You did it.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.102
(man on radio)
     'Ladies and gentlemen'

08:58.171 --> 09:00.739
'we interrupt this program
 to bring you a news bulletin.'

09:00.807 --> 09:02.507
'Vandenberg Air Force
     Base, California'

09:02.575 --> 09:05.876
'announces that at noon tomorrow
it will test a new missile'

09:05.945 --> 09:08.513
'designated,
     Operation Powderkeg.'

09:08.582 --> 09:11.015
'The warhead will be sent down
 the South Sea Missile Range'

09:11.084 --> 09:13.151
'to an isolated area,
     approximately'

09:13.220 --> 09:17.288
'140 degrees latitude
   and 10 degrees longitude.'

09:17.356 --> 09:19.991
'More on Operation Powderkeg
during our regularly scheduled'

09:20.060 --> 09:22.260
'news cast. We return
    you now to our studio.'

09:23.764 --> 09:25.863
Did he say 140 degrees latitude?

09:25.932 --> 09:27.232
- Yes.
  - And ten degrees longitude?

09:27.301 --> 09:28.667
What's the matter, Skipper?

09:28.735 --> 09:29.967
Don't anybody panic
   'cause I'm not really sure

09:30.036 --> 09:33.004
'but we were a 100 miles
    east of that position'

09:33.072 --> 09:35.173
'before we drifted
     for that three days.'

09:35.242 --> 09:37.942
And with the prevailing
    western currents

09:38.011 --> 09:40.177
well, that's approximately
   our position here.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.780
They said down the South Sea
Missile Range

09:41.848 --> 09:43.280
to an isolated area.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.283
That would confirm, an area
away from the shipping lanes.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.019
As far as the authorities,
no one inhabited.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.821
You mean?

10:02.335 --> 10:03.702
[telephone ringing]

10:07.707 --> 10:09.206
General Bryan.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.108
Vandenberg? Put him on.

10:11.177 --> 10:14.278
Yes, Colonel, I was just
   on my way to the airport.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.048
Technical problem
      in the new warhead?

10:17.117 --> 10:19.016
I see. Mm-hmm.

10:19.085 --> 10:21.853
We'll remove the explosive
 and go ahead with the launch.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.722
At least we can get a test
  of the new guidance system.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.392
No. No need to announce
    any change in plans.

10:29.529 --> 10:30.862
[dialing]

10:47.079 --> 10:48.312
- Hi, Gilligan.
        - Hi, Mary Ann.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.748
What are you doing?

10:49.816 --> 10:52.650
Straightening up so it'll
be nice when it's blown up.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.018
What have you got?

10:54.087 --> 10:55.887
A coconut cream pie for you.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.589
- For me?
           - Mm-hmm.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.690
You start thinking
at a time like this.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.393
I haven't been as nice
to you as I should.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.928
That's not true.
         You've been nice to me.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.630
I haven't.
Take last night for instance.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.732
You wanted another piece
of pie and I said no.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.301
You were right,
       that was my eighth piece.

11:10.369 --> 11:12.804
If you'd wanted it
why shouldn't you have eight?

11:12.873 --> 11:16.040
Because the first seven
         gave me a stomach ache.

11:16.108 --> 11:20.244
We haven't got much time left
between now and you know when.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.780
When?

11:23.316 --> 11:24.949
Oh, that when.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.884
Thought I'd be specially
    nice to everybody.

11:26.952 --> 11:28.085
I baked you two pies.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.187
I'll bring the other one
when it's ready.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.722
Thank you.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.959
Boy, what a way to go!

11:39.732 --> 11:40.798
(Skipper)
          'Gilligan!'

11:40.867 --> 11:42.767
In here, Skipper.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.735
- How about that Mary Ann?
   - Oh, no.

11:44.804 --> 11:46.403
She thought she wasn't being
    nice enough to me

11:46.472 --> 11:48.639
so she made me two pies.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.742
Actually, she's been
            wonderful to me.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.777
I haven't been very good
        to you, buddy.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.378
- That's not true.
       - Yes, it is.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.548
Don't say that to make me
  feel better. I know it's true.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.049
I yell at you
                and bawl you out

11:59.118 --> 12:01.953
when you're trying
              to do your best.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.722
What I'm saying is, I want
     you to have one of my pies.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.424
No, Skipper,
she made it for you.

12:06.492 --> 12:10.962
I insist, trying to make up for
 the way that I've treated you.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.364
And I know that if she
       had made two pies for you

12:13.432 --> 12:14.832
you'd give one to me.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.434
I want you
              to eat every bite.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.170
I like the way you treat me
and yell at me.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.306
Before it's late a man should
  look at the people around him.

12:22.375 --> 12:26.143
And figure out what he can do
   to make their lives happier.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.012
You don't know how happy
       you're gonna make me feel

12:28.081 --> 12:29.914
when I see you
                eating this pie.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.783
Oh, no, Skipper..

12:34.988 --> 12:37.188
Thanks a lot, Gilligan.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.791
[thud]

12:48.935 --> 12:51.669
Are you sure that
    you want to make a new will?

12:51.738 --> 12:53.070
Yes, I'd like
to get things right

12:53.139 --> 12:55.673
before we take a walk up
that great flight of stairs

12:55.742 --> 12:57.608
to the big bank vault
in the sky.

12:57.677 --> 13:00.711
What makes you sure we're
     gonna walk up and not down?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.479
That's the reason
I want a new will.

13:02.548 --> 13:06.317
Let me see, Lovey, up until now
my favorite charity has been me.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.153
I think it's time
       to think of other people.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.255
I direct in that will,
          that all the money

13:10.323 --> 13:13.124
from the First National Bank be
 distributed to needy children.

13:13.192 --> 13:17.328
Needy children. Oh, Thurston,
that's a marvelous idea.

13:17.396 --> 13:20.565
That means, of course, children
not living in Beverly Hills.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.400
Naturally. Now let's not
        forget medical science.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.871
- We must help fight disease.
 - Which disease, darling?

13:26.940 --> 13:29.073
That's quite a problem
     to decide which one.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.443
So let's leave ten million
   dollars to each disease.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.278
That ought to take care
    of all the money

13:34.347 --> 13:36.614
in the, uh,
     Second National Bank.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.082
Are there that many diseases?

13:38.151 --> 13:40.117
By the time they find
    our will in that bottle

13:40.186 --> 13:42.353
I think they'll discover
    some new diseases.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.156
Now, what about the money
  in the Third National Bank?

13:45.225 --> 13:46.557
We leave it
   to the First National Bank

13:46.626 --> 13:49.693
and let them worry about it.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.762
Marvelous, Lovey.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.731
Oh, before we put
that note in a bottle

13:53.800 --> 13:55.633
let's try once more
to figure out a way

13:55.701 --> 13:57.936
to see if we can
take it with us.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.274
- Hi.
           - Oh, hi.

14:04.343 --> 14:07.078
- Am I intruding?
       - Oh, no.

14:07.146 --> 14:10.148
I was just thinking what
        a waste my life's been.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.817
I mean, so, I was
            an actress, so what.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.885
I never really
        did anything for anyone.

14:14.954 --> 14:16.220
Well, you entertained people.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.322
Oh, that was just
               for the moment.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.491
I mean, really
    do something important.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.427
Like being a nurse.
    Although I was a nurse.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.763
For one day
    I was Ben Casey's nurse.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.598
And you know
     something, Professor?

14:27.667 --> 14:30.668
In that one hour,
      we saved six people.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.135
And if it hadn't been
     for the commercials

14:32.204 --> 14:33.604
we would have saved eight.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.673
You're right, Ginger,
    that's what's important.

14:35.741 --> 14:39.277
Saving people. I should
  never have become a teacher.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.312
Should have gone on
    with my work in science.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.780
You know, when
        I was in college

14:42.849 --> 14:44.649
we were working on a vision
  problem encountered

14:44.718 --> 14:46.917
by navy patrol fliers
     after they had spent

14:46.986 --> 14:50.021
several hours scanning
     the ocean and..

14:50.090 --> 14:52.156
- Wait, that's it!
       - What?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.993
What a fool I've been!
     Why, this is great.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.497
Skipper, Skipper. This is great.
Absolutely great!

14:59.565 --> 15:01.132
What's great, Professor?
        Take it easy.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.934
Take it easy? We can't.
Gotta get busy. Don't you see?

15:04.003 --> 15:05.736
We're not in danger.
This is our rescue.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.237
- Rescue?
          - Why, sure.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.140
Before the government
ever sends a missile

15:09.209 --> 15:12.176
they send a search plane
 to make sure the area's clear.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.512
They send a searching party
for fishing and pleasure craft.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.546
Or hunters or natives.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.082
Oh, Thurston,
we're practically rescued.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.984
My darling.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.120
I told you we were
              gonna be rescued.

15:22.188 --> 15:25.222
- I told you. I told you.
   - You did. You did.

15:25.291 --> 15:28.859
To make sure they see us, I'll
finish that mirror I was making.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.629
Will use it to signal the plane.
That should ensure our rescue.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.299
Let's get out, Professor. That's
the kind of insurance I like.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.366
Yes! Yes!

15:36.902 --> 15:39.269
Hurry up, Professor. That plane
 will be over any minute.

15:39.338 --> 15:40.771
That does it.
                  It's finished.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.073
Using gum wood paint
   should make a good reflector.

15:43.142 --> 15:44.708
C'mon, Skipper,
                 give me a hand.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.977
Oh, boy, alright, sure.

15:47.046 --> 15:48.513
[groans]

15:48.581 --> 15:51.849
Haven't seen myself in so long,
I forgot what I looked like.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.685
(Gilligan)
     Lost a lot of weight.

15:53.753 --> 15:56.887
Let me get a better grip on it.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.723
(Gilligan)
       Oops! Instant fat.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.994
Skipper, let's see
    how it works in the sun.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.598
Oh! I feel like
I'm in Hollywood.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.202
Come on, let's see
             what they're doing.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.270
Sure does work.

16:13.339 --> 16:15.907
It's not exactly ground glass,
 but with that strong sun

16:15.975 --> 16:18.176
I don't see how a plane
    could miss it.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.144
All we gotta do
         is wait for that plane.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.213
Get to the other
           side of the clearing.

16:22.281 --> 16:24.015
The view's better.
            Keep your eyes open.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.616
Aye aye, sir!

16:35.961 --> 16:37.995
There's a plane.
        There's a plane.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.564
Where? Where?

16:41.567 --> 16:42.966
- There it is!
         - There it is!

16:43.035 --> 16:44.168
[all cheering]

16:44.237 --> 16:46.137
There. Isn't that marvelous!

16:46.205 --> 16:47.771
It's the rescue plane.
     Set up the mirror.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.173
Set up the mirror.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.142
- Set up the mirror. That's it.
- Set up the mirror.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.679
Oh, boy, this is what
         we've been waiting for.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.514
Start flashing the signal.
   Start flashing the signal.

16:56.583 --> 16:57.748
[all screaming]

16:57.817 --> 16:58.849
No, Gilligan.
                   No-o!

16:58.918 --> 16:59.817
[crash]

16:59.886 --> 17:01.585
[glass shatters]

17:01.654 --> 17:04.555
Gilligan, Gilligan,
are you alright?

17:04.624 --> 17:05.890
I'm alright.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.590
You sure you're alright,
        little buddy?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.126
The plane, Professor!
           The plane!

17:09.194 --> 17:10.728
Everybody, quick!
Get a piece of glass.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.863
'Signal the plane with it.'

17:12.932 --> 17:14.631
- Here you go.
         - Yeah.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.568
(Skipper)
        Here, Mary Ann.
        Signal. Signal.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.503
Come back!
   I'm your biggest taxpayer.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.607
(Thurston)
      'I belong to the
      million mile club.'

17:32.151 --> 17:35.553
(man on radio)
'And the countdown has already
started on Operation Powderkeg''

17:36.322 --> 17:39.690
'Five, four, three'

17:39.759 --> 17:42.693
'two, one, zero.'

17:42.762 --> 17:43.828
[blast]

17:43.896 --> 17:45.963
'It's a perfect shot.'

17:46.032 --> 17:47.565
It would be.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.672
It should be along
any second now.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.474
Professor,
         how can you be so calm?

17:57.543 --> 18:00.043
You act like you're waiting for
an afternoon train or something.

18:00.112 --> 18:02.847
I think I see it.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.115
[whizzing]

18:19.265 --> 18:20.497
[all screaming]

18:20.566 --> 18:21.732
[crash]

18:24.603 --> 18:27.804
- It didn't detonate.
- And it didn't explode either.

18:27.873 --> 18:29.207
[all cheering]

18:30.877 --> 18:33.411
Look! Look.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.048
It's coming up the lagoon.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.218
It's coming right this way!

18:49.929 --> 18:51.462
(Professor)
      Don't make a noise.
      Don't even breathe.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.597
We're not. I don't think
my heart's beating.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.066
Thurston, you're so brave,
      you're not even shaking.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.569
I can't. I think
        rigor mortis has set in.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.038
A vibration
       could blow us up.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.839
Our only chance is to disarm it.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.408
How do we do that?

19:04.477 --> 19:07.678
Someone will have to remove the
access panel and crawl inside.

19:07.746 --> 19:10.680
There's only one of us small
and thin enough to fit in there.

19:10.749 --> 19:12.850
Who?

19:18.525 --> 19:19.624
[bang]

19:19.692 --> 19:21.692
[beeping]

19:31.270 --> 19:33.538
[beeping continues]

19:59.465 --> 20:00.698
Come on, Gilligan,
             I've got the tools.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.433
Maybe if we wait,
they'll send a repairman?

20:02.501 --> 20:05.269
Oh, please, Gilligan,
   there may be a timing device.

20:05.338 --> 20:08.906
Here, you hold these.
        We'll take it very easy.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.274
I'll remove the access panel

20:10.343 --> 20:12.143
that'll have a chart
           with the color codes.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.343
That way I'll be able
           to figure out

20:13.412 --> 20:16.746
which wire you've
               to disconnect.

20:16.815 --> 20:17.882
[clang]

20:19.818 --> 20:23.254
Professor, you gotta get in
there and give it one good hit.

20:25.491 --> 20:28.158
Let me do this.
       Your job will come later.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.627
Yes, sir.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.363
Gilligan, you're gonna have
to find a green and yellow wire.

20:33.432 --> 20:34.898
That wire will
             disarm the missile.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.834
A green and yellow wire, yeah.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.237
Alright, now, carefully.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.273
(Professor)
     'Every moment counts.'

20:43.909 --> 20:44.875
That's it.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.952
[thud]

21:04.063 --> 21:05.696
I found it.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.265
- I found it.
         - Oh, good.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.267
Now, you're gonna have
to trace that wire

21:10.336 --> 21:12.036
until you come to a bus bar.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.137
A busbar?

21:13.206 --> 21:15.839
Busbar, is a long
copper rectangle

21:15.908 --> 21:17.608
with a lot of wires
attached to it.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.643
You've gotta take that wire
off the connector

21:19.712 --> 21:20.911
and that'll disarm the missile.

21:20.979 --> 21:21.946
- Oh.
        - And, Gilligan.

21:22.015 --> 21:23.347
Yeah?

21:23.416 --> 21:25.883
If the end of that wire
touches any other connector

21:25.952 --> 21:28.019
you'll blow us all up.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.162
Take it easy, little buddy.

21:38.231 --> 21:40.298
Oh, Gilligan, please be careful.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.938
Oh, yeah, here it is.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.390
[bang]

22:06.459 --> 22:07.458
[screaming]

22:07.526 --> 22:09.393
(Skipper)
         Gilligan, no!

22:11.864 --> 22:13.397
[whizzing]

22:17.704 --> 22:19.637
Fire!

22:21.674 --> 22:24.074
- Gilligan's still in there.
  - He's in there, that boy!

22:24.142 --> 22:26.677
Oh, it's coming back!

22:28.547 --> 22:30.748
He didn't have a chance
    to get out.

22:44.096 --> 22:45.996
Thurston, I think we
   ought to rename the house

22:46.065 --> 22:49.033
in South Hampton,
      "Gilligan's acres."

22:49.101 --> 22:52.936
I was going to have a Gilligan
scholarship at Harvard.

22:53.005 --> 22:55.773
(Skipper)
     'The next boat I get,
     I'm gonna call her'

22:55.842 --> 22:57.574
"The Gilligan."

22:57.643 --> 23:00.578
When I get to Hollywood,
I'll sell a story to the movies.

23:00.646 --> 23:01.779
Oh.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.113
Gee, it all sounds so wonderful.

23:03.182 --> 23:05.549
I think I'll go back
      and drown myself.

23:06.418 --> 23:08.419
[all cheering]

23:20.299 --> 23:21.598
Mr. Howell?

23:21.667 --> 23:23.900
Eh, yes, yes, Gilligan,
my boy, what is it?

23:23.969 --> 23:25.702
Remember when everybody thought
 they were gonna be blown up?

23:25.771 --> 23:27.504
How nice they were
              to each other?

23:27.573 --> 23:29.606
Gilligan, when people
are in trouble

23:29.675 --> 23:31.809
they make concessions
and promises.

23:31.877 --> 23:34.545
When their trouble is over they
forget those fancy promises.

23:34.613 --> 23:35.679
Would you, Mr. Howell?

23:35.748 --> 23:37.515
A Howell go back
on his word? Never!

23:37.583 --> 23:41.318
Our family crest is honesty,
fidelity, integrity.

23:41.387 --> 23:43.687
- I thought so.
    - Uh, wait, what's that?

23:43.756 --> 23:45.922
It's your will. Found it
 when I swam out of the missile.

23:45.991 --> 23:47.157
I'm throwing it
              back in the water.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.259
No! No, my boy! Don't!

23:49.328 --> 23:50.694
[Thurston crying]

23:50.763 --> 23:52.530
[splash]

24:01.841 --> 24:03.040
¶ Now this is the tale
     of our castaways ¶

24:03.109 --> 24:05.075
¶ They're here
    for a long, long time ¶

24:05.144 --> 24:07.644
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

24:07.713 --> 24:09.679
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

24:09.748 --> 24:11.582
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

24:11.651 --> 24:13.784
¶ Will do their very best ¶

24:13.852 --> 24:16.253
¶ To make the others
      comfortable ¶

24:16.322 --> 24:18.188
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

24:18.257 --> 24:20.390
¶ No phone, no lights
     no motorcars ¶

24:20.459 --> 24:22.559
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

24:22.628 --> 24:24.661
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

24:24.730 --> 24:26.830
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

24:26.898 --> 24:28.999
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

24:29.068 --> 24:31.268
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

24:31.337 --> 24:33.737
¶ For seven stranded castaways ¶

24:33.806 --> 24:36.640
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶

24:37.305 --> 24:43.749
