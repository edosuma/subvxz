All right. What do you
want to see next?

00:35.969 --> 00:37.437
A cheetah! A fart!

00:37.504 --> 00:39.439
A cookie! An
external hard drive!

00:39.506 --> 00:41.099
Oh, oh!

00:41.174 --> 00:42.802
Change into Finn but
give him my body!

00:42.876 --> 00:44.640
Beemo, your ideas are boring.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.306
What? Your head on my
body isn't boring.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.246
It's weird.

00:49.315 --> 00:52.877
All right, I'll try to turn
into a cheetah farting.

00:52.952 --> 01:00.952
Pbfffffffffffffffffffffffffffft!

01:01.861 --> 01:03.830
I can't do the spots.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.766
Sparkles in the house?

01:07.834 --> 01:09.632
Let's squish 'em!

01:12.739 --> 01:14.731
Hyah!

01:16.943 --> 01:18.639
Did you squish the sparkles?

01:18.711 --> 01:21.146
No. They were around this
holo-message player.

01:21.214 --> 01:22.546
It's got a cartridge with it.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.447
Oh, snap!

01:24.517 --> 01:26.281
Well, plop that cartridge
in the slot, playa!

01:26.352 --> 01:28.150
Yeah! Okay!

01:30.623 --> 01:32.387
<i>Hello, boys.</i>

01:33.693 --> 01:34.626
Dad!

01:34.694 --> 01:36.672
<i>If you're hearing this
pre-recorded hologram message,</i>

01:36.696 --> 01:38.460
<i>it's because I've passed on</i>

01:38.531 --> 01:40.159
<i>and my spirit
sparkles guided you</i>

01:40.233 --> 01:41.724
<i>to its secret hiding place.</i>

01:41.801 --> 01:43.479
<i>Right now, I'm holding
both of you in my hands.</i>

01:43.503 --> 01:45.665
<i>You're both still
little, squishy babies.</i>

01:54.380 --> 01:55.939
<i>I made you boys something.</i>

01:56.015 --> 01:58.109
<i>It's a dungeon...
A proper dungeon</i>

01:58.184 --> 02:01.279
<i>full of evil monsters,
traps, and magic...</i>

02:01.354 --> 02:02.947
<i>The whole kazoo!</i>

02:03.022 --> 02:04.547
- Kickin'!
- Whoa, kickin'!

02:04.624 --> 02:07.253
<i>Now, this next part of the
message is just for you, Jake,</i>

02:07.327 --> 02:10.161
<i>so, Finn, cover your ears.</i>

02:10.229 --> 02:12.722
<i>Jake, really this
dungeon is for Finn.</i>

02:12.799 --> 02:14.859
<i>I wanna make something</i>

02:14.934 --> 02:16.527
<i>that'll force Finn
to toughen up.</i>

02:16.603 --> 02:17.434
What?

02:17.504 --> 02:19.302
<i>All right, tell Finn to
uncover his ears now.</i>

02:19.372 --> 02:21.307
Dude, take your hands
off your head.

02:21.374 --> 02:23.002
What?!

02:23.076 --> 02:25.068
<i>All right, boys, now, to
give you some incentive,</i>

02:25.145 --> 02:27.410
<i>at the end of the dungeon, I'm
putting the family sword.</i>

02:27.480 --> 02:29.073
<i>It's made out of demon's blood.</i>

02:30.650 --> 02:31.948
- Whoa! What the...?
- Oh, dang!

02:32.018 --> 02:33.953
<i>Give me back my blood, Joshua!</i>

02:34.020 --> 02:35.648
<i>Kee oth rama pancake!</i>

02:35.722 --> 02:36.722
<i>Aaaaaaaargh!</i>

02:36.789 --> 02:38.724
- Whoa!
- Geez Louise!

02:38.791 --> 02:40.453
<i>The dungeon's 80
paces west of here</i>

02:40.527 --> 02:42.155
<i>under a dumb-looking rock.</i>

02:42.228 --> 02:44.163
<i>And, Finn, this dungeon's
gonna kick your tail.</i>

02:44.230 --> 02:46.030
<i>I bet you won't even get
past the first trial,</i>

02:46.065 --> 02:47.795
<i>you whiny baby.</i>

02:47.867 --> 02:49.768
What? What was <i>that</i> about?

02:49.836 --> 02:53.466
Uh... I dunno.

02:53.540 --> 02:57.136
Duhh. Duhh. Duhhh.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.374
Whoo!

03:07.086 --> 03:08.850
Whoa! Burgers and hot dogs!

03:08.922 --> 03:10.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

03:11.925 --> 03:14.360
- Wait, Jake!
- But... burgers and hot dogs.

03:14.427 --> 03:17.693
Didn't you say you were hungry
for burgers this <i>morning?</i>

03:17.764 --> 03:18.629
Yeah. So?

03:18.698 --> 03:21.065
And I said I was
hungry for hot dogs?

03:21.134 --> 03:22.261
Mm-hmm. I remember.

03:22.335 --> 03:24.463
I don't think those
burgers and hot dogs

03:24.537 --> 03:26.699
are burgers and hot dogs at all.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.644
Aaaaaaaaaaah...

03:31.711 --> 03:32.711
Boom!!

03:48.127 --> 03:49.720
Yaaaaaaah!

03:49.796 --> 03:51.924
Ew.

03:51.998 --> 03:53.227
Duhhh.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.662
Hyah!

04:00.840 --> 04:02.138
Ahhhh.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.870
Dude!

04:03.943 --> 04:05.935
Look!

04:08.815 --> 04:10.340
<i>Finn, cover up those
nubs on your head.</i>

04:10.416 --> 04:12.715
Man, again?

04:12.785 --> 04:15.721
<i>All right, Jake, I wanna remind
you what this dungeon's for.</i>

04:15.788 --> 04:18.154
<i>In order for Finn
to stop whining,</i>

04:18.224 --> 04:20.216
<i>he needs to be put
through a trial</i>

04:20.293 --> 04:22.093
<i>that forces him to take
charge of a situation.</i>

04:22.161 --> 04:24.562
But, Dad, Finn's already
figured that out.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.327
He's a good kid
with a kind heart.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.994
<i>Remember, Jake, this is a
pre-recorded holo-message.</i>

04:29.068 --> 04:31.046
<i>I can't hear you if you're
talking to me right now.</i>

04:31.070 --> 04:32.834
I'm gonna go walk around!

04:32.905 --> 04:34.669
Okay!

04:34.741 --> 04:36.175
<i>Jake, I need your help.</i>

04:36.242 --> 04:37.676
<i>You got to call
Finn a whiny baby.</i>

04:37.744 --> 04:39.337
- But...
<i>- Butts are for pooping.</i>

04:39.412 --> 04:40.971
<i>Do it for Poppy.</i>

04:42.015 --> 04:45.179
Finn?! - Over here!

04:45.251 --> 04:47.777
Check it out, Jake.
I found two ways.

04:47.854 --> 04:50.119
This way has some
kind of flower trap,

04:50.189 --> 04:52.920
and that way... has <i>that</i> guy.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.985
None shall pa-a-a-a-ss!

04:56.062 --> 04:58.497
Ugh! Let's take the flower path.

04:58.564 --> 04:59.862
Mm.

04:59.932 --> 05:03.767
Wait! Why don't you
want to take <i>my</i> path?

05:03.836 --> 05:06.533
Because you're super gross, man.

05:06.606 --> 05:07.606
Oh.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.269
Cheer up, man.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.621
We're only telling you you're
gross because we're your bros.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.738
Really?

05:13.813 --> 05:16.078
Yeah. Bros are real
with each other.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.675
And you're gross, brother.
Take a bath.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.481
Thanks, brother.

05:20.553 --> 05:22.545
No probs.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.390
Hey, what did Dad say?

05:25.458 --> 05:28.053
Um...

05:28.127 --> 05:30.062
He said he's surprised
a whiny baby like you

05:30.129 --> 05:31.620
made it this far.

05:31.698 --> 05:34.361
What? Why's Dad
saying all that jive?

05:34.434 --> 05:35.868
Mrnh.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.029
<i>Jake, do it for Poppy!</i>

05:40.106 --> 05:44.168
Because you cry
like a baby, baby!

05:44.243 --> 05:47.407
Dude, you're picking on me, too?

05:50.016 --> 05:52.713
Whoa.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.450
I don't even cry much.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.049
I only cry when it's healthy,
like when people die.

06:00.126 --> 06:03.221
Partake of the fruit.

06:03.296 --> 06:04.855
Pfth! Blech! Ugh.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.331
If I didn't cry
when people died,

06:06.399 --> 06:07.890
I'd have a cold
butt for a heart.

06:07.967 --> 06:11.096
The fru-u... u-it.

06:11.170 --> 06:14.106
"Waaaah! I cry when people die!

06:14.173 --> 06:16.142
Waaaah! I'm Finn!"

06:16.209 --> 06:18.838
Partake of the fruit.

06:18.911 --> 06:21.005
Maybe I <i>will</i> partake
of the fruit!

06:21.080 --> 06:23.106
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, fruit!

06:23.182 --> 06:25.117
- Dude, don't eat that!
- Why not?

06:25.184 --> 06:27.119
All the people that I
care about in this world

06:27.186 --> 06:29.781
are being wads. - Ohh...

06:29.856 --> 06:33.258
<i>Don't you blow Poppy's cover!</i>

06:33.326 --> 06:37.491
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

06:42.135 --> 06:44.127
Whoa.

06:50.710 --> 06:54.977
Time to go, baby.

06:55.047 --> 06:56.777
Finn, come on!

06:56.849 --> 06:59.284
I'm gonna hang here
with these fruit babes.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.480
<i>They'll</i> be my best buds now.

07:01.554 --> 07:03.182
Yah!

07:26.312 --> 07:27.905
There's another cartridge!

07:27.980 --> 07:33.749
Pbffffffffffffffffffft!

07:33.820 --> 07:36.585
All right, man, Dad told me
not to tell you this, but...

07:36.656 --> 07:38.318
<i>Don't tell him!</i>

07:38.391 --> 07:40.622
You're not real.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.490
Dad asked me to call you "baby"

07:46.566 --> 07:48.034
'cause he wants you to be tough.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.535
But I'm tough! My whole
body is a callus!

07:54.307 --> 07:55.707
Ugh.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.573
On this next holo-message
we listen to,

07:57.643 --> 07:59.874
when Dad tells you to
cover your ears...

07:59.946 --> 08:02.643
don't.

08:02.715 --> 08:05.082
Hmph.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.052
<i>Hey, hey! Finn! Jake!</i>

08:07.119 --> 08:09.088
<i>You made it past
the fruit witches.</i>

08:09.155 --> 08:12.216
<i>Hey, did they make you
cry, Finn, huh? Huh?</i>

08:12.291 --> 08:14.021
<i>I bet they did.</i>

08:14.093 --> 08:16.324
<i>All right. Now cover
your ears, Sue.</i>

08:16.395 --> 08:18.193
<i>Jake, I'm almost done
with this dungeon.</i>

08:18.264 --> 08:20.242
<i>I just have one last monster
to fit into this pit I dug.</i>

08:20.266 --> 08:22.201
<i>I got him tied up in
this room I'm building.</i>

08:22.268 --> 08:24.203
<i>It's really hard trying
to fit him in this pit.</i>

08:24.270 --> 08:25.829
<i>He's pretty evil.</i>

08:25.905 --> 08:27.816
<i>You're gonna have a crazy
time trying to defeat...</i>

08:27.840 --> 08:28.864
<i>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</i>

08:28.941 --> 08:30.933
Dad!

08:34.847 --> 08:36.839
Dad's sword!

08:41.988 --> 08:44.355
<i>Hey, Jake, when Finn
finishes this dungeon,</i>

08:44.423 --> 08:46.051
<i>play this tape for him.</i>

08:46.125 --> 08:47.593
<i>Finn...</i> - Ugh!

08:47.660 --> 08:50.425
<i>This pre-recorded
holo-message...</i>

08:54.066 --> 08:56.592
Finn!

08:56.669 --> 08:57.762
Oof!

08:58.971 --> 09:01.270
Dude! Use your karate biz!

09:01.340 --> 09:03.241
Ugh. I... oof!

09:03.309 --> 09:04.675
I can't, man! I suck!

09:04.744 --> 09:06.269
I'm a whiny baby, and I'm fat

09:06.345 --> 09:08.405
and all those things
Dad said about me!

09:08.481 --> 09:10.211
Dude! Dad loves you!
