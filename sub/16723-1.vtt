WEBVTT

00:20.729 --> 00:23.273
Ah! Air.

00:23.356 --> 00:26.526
Come on, kids.
Get some of that woodsy air in your lungs.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.111
Oh, that's pretty woodsy, right?

00:28.653 --> 00:31.072
- Woodsiest I've ever smelled.
- Yeah.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.033
My musk will blend right in.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.118
I'm pretty sure camping
isn't good for my, pfft,

00:35.201 --> 00:36.286
I don't know, knees?

00:36.369 --> 00:38.329
I've got a note around here somewhere.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.457
I'll write you a note
after I write myself one.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.751
Come on, guys,
it's not Tina's fault she was sick

00:42.834 --> 00:44.544
when her Thundergirl troop went camping.

00:44.627 --> 00:47.672
This way, you all get to go on
my make-up camping trip. Yay.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.341
What do we know about camping?

00:49.424 --> 00:52.177
We come from a family of city dwellers.
We're all gonna die.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.928
Hey, I know plenty about camping.

00:54.012 --> 00:56.723
I used to go camping, once,
when I was a kid.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.350
It's great, from what I remember.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.060
Plus, what would you say if I told you

01:00.143 --> 01:03.146
I'm carrying a saw in my pocket right now?

01:03.229 --> 01:04.939
Is that what you said when you met Mom?

01:05.023 --> 01:06.358
Are those nail clippers?

01:06.441 --> 01:07.942
It's my Nature Master.

01:08.026 --> 01:08.943
It's a multi-tool.

01:09.027 --> 01:12.197
-It does everything nature requires.
-Could it kill an eagle?

01:12.280 --> 01:13.782
Why would we want to kill an eagle?

01:13.865 --> 01:15.909
I don't know. They're so condescending.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.619
Yes. We're killing eagles.

01:17.702 --> 01:20.872
Actually, my Thundergirl handbook says
to leave only footprints,

01:20.955 --> 01:22.916
so we probably shouldn't kill anything.

01:24.292 --> 01:28.171
We could go on a 13-smile hike.
There's taking pictures with your mind.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.006
Consensual bird watching.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.217
- We don't have to do any of that, do we?
- No.

01:37.055 --> 01:37.972
Hiya, folks.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.891
You picked a great weekend to camp.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.434
You'll all be fine.

01:41.518 --> 01:45.146
Um, great. Wait, why'd you say
we'll all be fine?

01:45.230 --> 01:47.107
Because you will. You'll all be fine.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.858
Just mind the river, that's all.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.194
It's, uh, high this year.
But you'll be fine.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.571
-And your family will be fine.
-Okay.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.451
-ThunderMint?
-No. Keep those in a sealed container.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.870
We've had some aggressive wildlife
out here lately.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.372
-Bears?
-No. Squirrels.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.250
-Seriously?
-We've lost some good people recently.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.584
-To the squirrels?
-Bears.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.585
-What?
-What?

02:07.669 --> 02:10.130
Kidding. Budget cuts.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.507
They've made a lot of budget cuts
and now it's just me.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.718
People don't value the parks
and get what they get.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.428
Bob, this guy's freaking me out.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.805
Shh. It's fun. It's ranger humor.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.349
So, we're gonna drive now,
so, thanks for everything.

02:21.433 --> 02:22.976
Camp at your own risk.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.019
State park motto.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.770
Sir, I need you to lift the gate.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.105
Yeah, right, the gate. Sure.

02:27.188 --> 02:30.025
-Yeah, you just sort of left.
-Open. Open sesame.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.192
-There you go.
-Thank you.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.411
Nature boner.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.495
Boing.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.039
That's not what it is, Gene.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.040
Come on. It's a rock.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.791
It's a Wang. Mount Wang.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.209
William Archibald Wang,

02:48.293 --> 02:50.795
a Chinese diplomat,
was the first to summit that mountain.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.922
William Wang, what can't you do?

02:53.006 --> 02:53.840
Where's he now?

02:53.923 --> 02:56.926
Back in the city, staying at a hotel
like a normal person.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.595
Oh! Oh!

02:58.678 --> 03:00.305
What are those? Bees? Oh, I hate 'em.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.723
Great identification, Mom.

03:01.806 --> 03:02.807
Thank you, Tina.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.685
Wait, Bob, this is all you packed?

03:05.769 --> 03:08.229
Well, I mean, I packed this,
my Nature Master,

03:08.313 --> 03:11.024
and I got two tents
and this cool camping stove

03:11.107 --> 03:12.108
I borrowed from Teddy.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.986
What about food? And water?
And what about toiletries?

03:15.070 --> 03:17.030
Well, there's a river right there.

03:17.113 --> 03:20.325
That's all the water you could ever drink.
So we'll be fine for one day.

03:20.408 --> 03:23.453
And the river's
also nature's grocery store.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.498
That's where we get all our food,
like fish and vegetables.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.499
Vegetables?

03:27.582 --> 03:28.958
Yes. From upriver.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.001
Mac and cheese?

03:30.085 --> 03:32.629
And we'll make our own cheese.
We can do that in the woods.

03:32.712 --> 03:33.797
But how? I...

03:33.880 --> 03:36.633
Because you ferment the milk from, I--

03:36.716 --> 03:39.803
Look, people, everything we need
is right here.

03:39.886 --> 03:40.720
Or over there.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.472
There's no line for that food truck.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.515
You know what? Fine.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.059
I'm going to go catch me a meal.

03:46.142 --> 03:47.227
In that river.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.478
With this.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.438
We're gonna catch all the fish.

03:50.522 --> 03:51.398
God, I love you.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.983
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.112
We're camping over there,
and my husband blew it on packing.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.031
Can I borrow some crackers
or, you know, peanut butter?

04:00.115 --> 04:01.866
You guys, you look so prepared.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.786
You've got to be prepared
when civilization breaks down.

04:04.869 --> 04:08.498
-Oh.
-Wait, why will civilization break down?

04:08.581 --> 04:10.750
Have you been to the post office lately?

04:10.834 --> 04:12.377
-She knows.
-That's right I know.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.795
-What does she know?
-You know.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.381
-I know you know I know.
-What happens at the post office?

04:16.464 --> 04:18.091
-They seem organized.
-He doesn't know.

04:18.174 --> 04:20.051
-He doesn't know anything.
-What?

04:20.135 --> 04:23.263
Perhaps you might be interested in reading
more about it in our literature.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.640
Oh. Okay. Huh.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.226
Please, borrow whatever you need.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.854
-Ooh! That, plus that, plus that.
-Oh-- Uh--

04:30.937 --> 04:32.230
-Wow.
-I need my juice.

04:32.313 --> 04:36.276
Okay. Well, enjoy our provisions
while you digest our truths.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.111
Thank you so much.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.071
Um, can I borrow some wine, too?

04:40.155 --> 04:41.489
Wine helps me drink.

04:41.573 --> 04:42.615
Come on, kids, let's go.

04:43.742 --> 04:47.037
Mmm. Mmm.
Those kooks make some good chili.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.456
Bobby, you sure you don't want any chili?

04:49.539 --> 04:51.958
No. I will be enjoying the fish I caught.

04:52.042 --> 04:52.876
That's a fish?

04:52.959 --> 04:53.877
Yeah, Gene.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.920
It's a trout. It's king of the river.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.756
I can cut it up if anyone wants to share.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.216
You know, I'm not gonna be able
to eat all this.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.801
Are you sure you cooked it enough?

05:01.885 --> 05:05.055
Tina, the worst thing you can do
is overcook a trout.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.389
I wish I could cook it less.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.224
Enjoy your goldfish, wild man.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.227
That's a lot of bones.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.771
But with trout,

05:12.854 --> 05:14.731
when you're as experienced as I am...

05:14.814 --> 05:18.318
you learn to use your mouth
to take the bones out.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.528
Use the back of your throat.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.784
Wow. They're asleep.
Must be the woodsy air.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.870
Yeah, crazy how kids
can fall asleep sober like that.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.331
Mm. I read that there's a warm spring
around here.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.749
Some people skinny-dip there.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.501
You want to, uh, go find it?

05:34.584 --> 05:36.961
A warm spring?
Don't you mean a hot spring?

05:37.045 --> 05:38.380
Well, it said warm spring.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.632
-What about the kids?
-They're fine. We'll be close.

05:40.715 --> 05:44.094
Okay, but if a deer sees me naked,
you can't get jealous.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.304
What about the vest?

05:46.388 --> 05:48.348
Oh, no, this guy stays on.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.142
Oh, that's nice. Come on in.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.227
Whoo.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.939
Excuse me. Oh, that's really trouty.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.482
This is lukewarm at best.

05:57.565 --> 06:00.110
-They should call it a tepid spring.
-Really? Because I'm...

06:00.193 --> 06:01.695
Wow. I'm boiling in here.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.988
Oh, boy. I'm gonna, uh...

06:04.072 --> 06:05.198
I'm just use the restroom.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.701
I mean, a tree.
I mean, I got to get out of here.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.494
Hey, where you going?
Come back to Mommy.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.080
-No, not right now.
-Let's make this little warm spring hot.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.248
Don't, let go, Lin.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.417
-I got to go to the bathroom.
-Give me your hand.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.459
Let go. Please.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.170
-Lin. Definitely an emergency. Let go.
-Come to Mommy.

06:32.809 --> 06:33.810
What was that?

06:33.893 --> 06:35.228
-The loud sound?
-Yeah.

06:35.311 --> 06:36.229
Probably an owl?

06:36.312 --> 06:38.398
Should one of us go check it out? Not me?

06:38.481 --> 06:40.442
Guys, come on, listen, it's nature.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.360
We're not all gonna make it tonight.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.446
Safe, safe, goner.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.531
Good night.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.283
-Linda!
-Bob!

06:48.366 --> 06:49.576
Grab that branch!

06:56.708 --> 06:58.084
This river is really fast.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.544
Fastest I've ever seen.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.880
-You see lots of fast rivers, Bob?
-No!

07:01.963 --> 07:04.549
I'm just saying that
this is really fast, okay?

07:04.632 --> 07:06.968
-Oh, what do you know?
-You're gonna argue with me now?

07:07.052 --> 07:08.678
-Yes, now.
-When we're flying 30 miles

07:08.762 --> 07:10.138
an hour down a river?

07:12.474 --> 07:13.308
We made it.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.061
What the hell was that river's problem?

07:16.144 --> 07:17.145
You stupid river.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.190
I'm gonna sit down. Nope.
I'm gonna go over there for a sec.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.067
-Bob?
-Oh, boy.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.152
Lin, look over there. It's a pelican.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.779
And Patrick Duffy.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.030
Patrick Duffy? Where?

07:27.113 --> 07:28.156
I love Dallas.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.616
Oh, he ran away.

07:29.699 --> 07:33.036
-Where'd you go?
-I, uh, got a walking stick.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.163
That's why I went behind that bush.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.374
I didn't have diarrhea at all.
I love it out here.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.668
Oh, God. There's got to be
a better stick back there.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.836
-I'll go find it.
-Where are you, Bob? Bob?

07:41.920 --> 07:44.714
There's the better stick right there.
I found it.

07:44.798 --> 07:45.882
Hey, Lin.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.051
How do you like my new walking stick?

07:48.134 --> 07:50.929
That old one was so stupid
compared to this one.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.389
This is the one I wanted.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.061
Why does this vest smell like puke
and fish?

07:58.144 --> 07:59.688
That's the smell of a man.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.481
A healthy camping man.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.566
Camping's gross.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.859
And we're friggin' lost.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.903
You might be lost, but I'm not lost.

08:06.986 --> 08:07.946
I know the woods.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.573
All we have to do is just follow
the river back to camp.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.575
You sure about that, Mr. Outdoors?

08:12.659 --> 08:15.203
Yeah. We'll be in our tent
before the kids even wake up.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.706
Good. We got to get to the kids
before wolves raise 'em.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.791
It's my worst fear. Little Wolf Gene.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.293
I'd have to cut holes in all the seats
of his pants.

08:22.377 --> 08:23.920
-Why?
-For the tail.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.131
Why would we even dress him? He's a wolf.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.259
Because he'd still need to go to school
and be loved by the other kids.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.386
But he'd be a--
He wouldn't want to wear clothes.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.346
-It doesn't...
-It's because he's different.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.515
Do you know how much money
we would save, Lin?

08:37.517 --> 08:40.979
I'm gonna put
a breakfast order in at the RV.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.564
You guys want anything?

08:42.647 --> 08:43.690
Where are Mom and Dad?

08:43.773 --> 08:46.484
They're not in there?
Maybe they went for a morning hike.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.153
No.

08:49.612 --> 08:50.739
Look. It's their clothes.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.449
Oh, no. Mom and Dad melted.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.783
Things got a little physical.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.327
Signs of a struggle. Clothes went off.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.371
Then these rocks gave way and then whoosh.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.499
Oh, my God. Mom and Dad could be nude
dangling over the edge of a cliff.

09:01.583 --> 09:04.252
According to the Thundergirl handbook,
we should...

09:04.336 --> 09:06.921
wait here for a person
of authority to arrive.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.506
-Can I see that page?
-Sure.

09:08.590 --> 09:09.424
Thank you.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.345
We should tube down the river
and find Mom and Dad.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.096
We should really tube. Let's tube.

09:15.180 --> 09:18.224
Yes, let's tube. Why are we talking
when we should be tubing?

09:21.853 --> 09:22.729
Isn't this stealing?

09:22.812 --> 09:24.773
Nuh-uh, it's borrowing.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.524
Because Thundergirls don't steal.

09:26.608 --> 09:27.609
Well, we're borrowing.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.736
Borrow everything that isn't nailed down.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.531
You're staying with me
until I put you on Dad myself.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.201
Wait, let's tie our tubes together,
so we don't get separated.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.952
Yeah, let's get our tubes tied.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.954
Okay, let's whoosh.

09:40.038 --> 09:43.208
Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh!

09:43.291 --> 09:44.626
-Whoo!
-Yeah.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.129
Hey, look, it's Mount Wang.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.631
Why does it look so small?

09:49.714 --> 09:51.007
Oh, crap.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.467
We followed the wrong river.

09:53.677 --> 09:54.719
How did we do that?

09:54.803 --> 09:57.847
This feeds into that,
and we followed this all night.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.225
Oh, my God.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.142
I feel sick.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.061
Okay, okay.

10:03.144 --> 10:06.106
This is just like when we forgot
where we parked at the baseball game.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.315
We'll do what we did then.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.275
We walked back to the entrance
of the stadium

10:09.359 --> 10:10.944
and then we retraced our steps.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.862
We got to go down to this river again

10:12.946 --> 10:15.365
and we come up the right river
to the campsite.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.450
That's a dumb plan. It will take too long.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.451
Well, what do we do?

10:18.535 --> 10:21.538
-The kids must be worried sick about us.
-We need to go straight across.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.831
Are you sure, Bobby?

10:22.914 --> 10:23.832
Yes, I'm sure.

10:23.915 --> 10:26.084
The right way is that way?

10:26.167 --> 10:28.545
That might not have sounded like I'm sure
but I'm sure.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.714
All right, you're the Nature Master.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.632
We're coming for you, kids!

10:33.591 --> 10:35.218
We're coming for you Mom and Dad.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.369
Oh, I'm so hungry, Bobby.

11:01.453 --> 11:04.164
Oh, my God, I ate an ant.
Oh, I just ate another one.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.707
Lin, what are you doing?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.168
Oh, they're not bad. Oh, look, a worm.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.627
-Don't eat that...
-Right there.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.004
-No.
-Come here.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.297
-Come on.
-Don't eat a worm.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.799
-I don't want to see you eat a worm.
-Try it.

11:14.883 --> 11:17.052
-Get that way from me. Get it away.
-Just a taste.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.928
Oh, why did we go camping?

11:19.554 --> 11:22.015
There's nothing in here about
finding lost parents.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.517
Did you know there are eight
different ways to hold hands?

11:24.601 --> 11:27.437
Tina. Stop reading that stupid
Thundergirl book.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.689
I have something from the RV
I can read from.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.400
"Apocatips for the Apocalypse."

11:32.484 --> 11:34.444
"Don't wait for nightfall
to build shelter."

11:34.527 --> 11:35.362
That makes sense.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.530
"Leave no trace.
Shave off your fingerprints."

11:37.614 --> 11:39.157
Been saying that for years.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.785
My feet don't work anymore.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.203
-Carry me.
-Oh, come on.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.246
We got to get to the kids
before it gets dark.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.539
Right, the kids.

11:46.623 --> 11:47.749
Second wind.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.250
Didn't work.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.086
Okay, I guess we're stopping.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.922
I'm just gonna lay down for a sec,
recharge my battery, all right?

11:54.005 --> 11:56.758
Oh, my God. We're gonna spend
another night in the woods?

11:56.841 --> 11:58.051
Okay. We need a fire.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.094
We got to make a fire.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.763
Just, um, put some wood on your face.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.264
Bob, you're not making sense.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.516
Don't say fish.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.434
Oh, Bobby. Help!

12:06.518 --> 12:08.144
Can anyone hear me?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.938
Patrick Duffy!

12:10.438 --> 12:13.274
"Now that your shelter is built,
you must seal the perimeter.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.819
Remember the 30 sticks you've sharpened
to a deadly point?"

12:15.902 --> 12:17.987
-Yeah.
-"They will now be utilized."

12:18.071 --> 12:22.075
I thought they were for some kind of skit.
Thundergirls do skits around the campfire.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.077
What skit would that possibly be for?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.871
I don't know. You should see some
of the skits that get produced.

12:26.955 --> 12:27.914
Look at this part.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.459
They say insects can
and should be weaponized.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.920
"Beware of any organization
that rewards members

12:34.004 --> 12:35.797
with empty titles or trinkets.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.716
These are the wool of the sheep."

12:37.799 --> 12:38.800
Hey, Tina,

12:38.883 --> 12:41.636
you're looking
a little sheepish yourself right now.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.722
My Thundergirl patches aren't trinkets.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.807
Though I did get this patch
for making trinkets.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.017
We wouldn't be here

12:47.100 --> 12:49.602
if it weren't for your stupid
make-up trip.

12:49.686 --> 12:53.106
And we've learned more useful stuff
in two hours from this baby

12:53.189 --> 12:55.859
than you've ever learned from
those brainwashing Thundergirls.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.152
I'm not brainwashed.

12:57.235 --> 13:00.113
-Do you chant or repeat mantras?
-No.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.990
I'm a Thundergirl.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.700
I'm a Thundergirl.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.410
I'm a Thundergirl.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.580
-Oh. Yes.
-Shut up. Shut up!

13:08.663 --> 13:09.539
Look over there.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.207
We're not alone, guys.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.085
It could be aggressive squirrels
worshiping fire.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.211
It could be Mom and Dad.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.796
Either way, grab a spear.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.006
We're going in.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.426
Rain, rain

13:21.509 --> 13:23.011
Flash, flash

13:23.094 --> 13:25.430
Thundergirls wear a thunder sash

13:25.513 --> 13:26.348
Oh, my God.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.516
That sounds like Thundergirl troop
number 39.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.519
-They won the regional chant-off.
-Hello, who's over there?

13:31.603 --> 13:33.688
-We are.
-Yeah, we are.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.607
Hey, you're a Thundergirl.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.317
Yeah, she was.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.195
Until she learned
that organizations like this

13:40.278 --> 13:42.113
are soul stealers!

13:42.197 --> 13:43.323
I don't understand.

13:43.406 --> 13:46.201
-Did you get sep--?
-"Oh, I don't understand."

13:46.284 --> 13:49.162
Can I just-- Did you get separated
from your troop?

13:49.245 --> 13:52.624
No. My troop got separated from reality.

13:52.707 --> 13:53.958
Thundergirls are a sham.

13:54.042 --> 13:54.876
Yeah.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.086
Lay it on 'em, Tine!

13:56.169 --> 13:57.462
I used to be like you.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.380
This morning.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.173
I only cared about sashes and patches.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.591
Sashes and patches!

14:01.675 --> 14:02.842
Then I woke up.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.511
She woke the hell up!

14:04.594 --> 14:07.013
You kids should camp with us.
We have plenty of food...

14:07.097 --> 14:08.765
I'd rather die!

14:08.848 --> 14:11.226
We don't need your food. Or your lies.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.103
Unless you have some cookies.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.646
And not the oatmeal ones!

14:14.729 --> 14:16.731
-Never the oatmeal ones!
-Yeah.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.734
Even if they have chocolate chips in them,
they're still oatmeal!

14:19.818 --> 14:23.071
The truth is, you're all just cogs
in a cookie-selling machine.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.948
-Right.
-You're a cog, you're a cog.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.408
You're definitely a cog.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.742
-You're more of a pawn.
-What?

14:27.826 --> 14:29.077
Honey, I think you're tired.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.245
And you're kind of dirty.

14:30.328 --> 14:33.039
I've never been more awake
and dirty in my life.

14:33.123 --> 14:36.084
I hereby renounce my Tenderheart-level
membership to the Thundergirls.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.004
Yeah!

14:39.087 --> 14:40.422
We're out of here!

14:40.505 --> 14:42.173
Yeah, and we're taking these.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.133
And this one.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.676
-Good luck with your skit.
-Thanks.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.347
Oh, you're hogging all the blankets.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.558
Come on. Get up. Come on.
I'm leading us. Let's go.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.643
What are you talking about? Ow. Ow.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.270
-You're sick.
-I'm not sick.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.980
-Then what the hell is that?
-What?

14:57.063 --> 14:59.607
I'll tell you what that is,
it's diarrhea and throw-up.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.694
You're firing from both ends.
I studied the ballistics. It checks out.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.195
That was probably a bobcat.

15:04.279 --> 15:05.113
Oh, okay.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.449
You didn't eat a raw trout
that didn't make you poop

15:07.532 --> 15:09.075
and barf your way through the forest

15:09.159 --> 15:11.202
like some kind of disgusting
Hansel and Gretel.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.038
I'm taking charge here. We're gonna go.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.330
Come on. This way now.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.582
No. Not that way.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.499
It's this way.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.543
You don't even know
what you're doing out here.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.836
I don't know what I'm doing?

15:19.919 --> 15:23.631
I fed myself ants and grubs
and I made a wilderness hairbrush.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.008
Doesn't work, but still.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.719
Plus, you're sick, so let's go.
I'm Nature Master now.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.346
You're never Nature Master.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.680
I'm Nature Master.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.390
I'll go back to camp this way

15:32.474 --> 15:34.100
and then we'll send help for you!

15:34.184 --> 15:36.186
Oh, come on. Just stick with me.

15:36.269 --> 15:40.482
-You've got horrible diarrhea, Bob.
-You've got horrible diarrhea, Bob!

15:41.775 --> 15:44.194
Day one without the sash.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.364
Got to figure out who I am
and what I'm going to wear diagonally

15:47.447 --> 15:48.281
across my chest.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.783
-Seatbelt?
-Bandolier?

15:49.866 --> 15:51.117
-Oh, yeah.
-And tonight,

15:51.201 --> 15:52.744
we take off your fingerprints.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.829
All right, people, let's move out.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.373
Got to find the kids.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.124
Got to beat Linda.

15:58.958 --> 15:59.834
Need strength.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.711
Got to find food.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.047
Kids! Kids. Mommy's coming.

16:04.756 --> 16:05.965
I'm headed for the wang.

16:06.049 --> 16:08.134
I can see the tip.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.720
Oh, Bobby, why do you gotta be
such a wang.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.224
Is that, is that a nut?

16:14.307 --> 16:15.684
What are you, an acorn?

16:15.767 --> 16:17.727
If you're poisonous, tell me now.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.021
Hey. Get back here with my nut,
you jerk.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.274
Well, well, well.

16:23.358 --> 16:26.986
It looks like the squirrel
has become the idiot.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.447
Thanks for doing the heavy lifting,
squirrels.

16:32.283 --> 16:33.451
Oh, boy.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.080
Get away from me. Get away from me.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.499
Don't eat me.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.751
I don't have the strength to fight.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.253
This is how I'm gonna die.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.216
This is taking forever.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.260
Hurry up and eat me.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.097
-Linda?
-That's my man!

16:54.180 --> 16:55.640
You get your paws off those nuts.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.851
Hi-ya. Ya! Whoo!

16:57.934 --> 16:59.144
You saved me.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.354
Yeah, I missed your stinky face.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.857
How you feelin',
my little salmonella fella?

17:03.940 --> 17:06.109
Uh, better. All empty.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.486
Sorry, I left you back there.
That was stupid.

17:08.570 --> 17:10.530
Oh, Bobby. Come on, let's go.

17:10.613 --> 17:13.241
Hey, Linda, there are two Nature Masters.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.618
The one I left at camp,
I miss that one so bad,

17:15.702 --> 17:18.538
but the other Nature Master is you.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.290
-Aw.
-This is a fishing pole.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.251
This is a toothpick,
what the hell is this?

17:23.335 --> 17:24.878
-You got to get that removed.
-What?

17:24.961 --> 17:27.422
-That's, like, a huge wart.
-Don't look at that. Stop it.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.049
Come on, we got to get back to camp.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.803
-Holy crap. We're here.
-Kids!

17:34.596 --> 17:36.222
-Bobby, the kids are gone!
-What?

17:36.306 --> 17:37.640
- They're in here.
- What?

17:37.724 --> 17:40.393
-Yeah, hurry. We got fudge in here, too.
-Fudge.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.562
-Kids?
-Gene. Tina. Louise.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.314
Where are you, babies? Where are you?

17:44.397 --> 17:46.566
-Your kids aren't here.
-And neither is the fudge.

17:46.649 --> 17:47.734
-What?
-What?

17:47.817 --> 17:48.985
Your kids stole the fudge.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.613
Along with our inner tubes
and our travel backgammon set.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.531
And a copy of our survivalist guide.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.450
Um, okay, I'm sorry about that.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.285
But where are they? We need to find them.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.287
We've been in the woods
for, like, 40 hours.

17:59.371 --> 18:01.498
Well, we've been in the woods
for 40 months.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.751
And we think
you've got what it takes to join us.

18:04.834 --> 18:05.835
What do you say, Linda?

18:05.919 --> 18:07.796
Did our literature speak to you?

18:07.879 --> 18:09.881
What? Who cares about any of that crud?

18:09.964 --> 18:11.049
We need to find our kids.

18:11.132 --> 18:11.966
Forget your kids.

18:12.050 --> 18:15.220
They're floating in very high quality
inner tubes down a river eating fudge.

18:15.303 --> 18:16.596
-And playing backgammon.
-Um...

18:16.680 --> 18:19.307
All right, well,
we're gonna go to them now, okay?

18:19.391 --> 18:20.725
Hold on, hold up.

18:20.809 --> 18:21.726
Is this bear mace?

18:21.810 --> 18:24.145
Why are you holding bear mace in my face?

18:24.229 --> 18:27.982
We need to know that you are ready
to accept our invitation.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.567
Okay.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.403
Let's put on our "Ritual of Trust" music.

18:31.486 --> 18:32.779
I'll get the trust lotion.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.030
They're not here. Now what?

18:34.114 --> 18:36.241
Let's get a tiny bit more fudge.

18:36.324 --> 18:37.909
Or a lot bit more fudge.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.662
♪ Everybody dance now ♪

18:42.288 --> 18:44.499
What the hell is going on? What do we do?

18:44.582 --> 18:47.043
Shh! I have an idea
how to get us out of here.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.086
Just follow my lead.

18:48.169 --> 18:49.504
Okay.

18:49.587 --> 18:50.714
Here we go.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.132
Let's lotion up. Yeah.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.049
Great.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.760
You're the first ever to agree
to the Ritual of Trust.

18:55.844 --> 18:57.554
This is gonna be so icy hot.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.139
Oh, it sure is, hon.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.223
Very sexual.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.392
-I am looking forward to it.
-Whoo. Yes.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.145
Can I just use your tiny restroom
to freshen up?

19:05.228 --> 19:07.397
Trust me,
you don't want any of this like this.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.233
Nah. Yeah, we smell like ass.
Come on, Bobby.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.402
♪ Ooh, yeah, you tell me... ♪

19:12.485 --> 19:14.988
-It's too small.
-Mom?

19:15.071 --> 19:16.906
- Oh, my babies.
- Is that the kids?

19:16.990 --> 19:18.033
What are you guys doing?

19:18.116 --> 19:19.659
Uh, trying to escape.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.161
But not successfully.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.078
Go get help.

19:22.162 --> 19:25.123
Your father and I are being held hostage
by the horny hermits.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.542
Hm. I think I've got a plan.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.044
A plan bee.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.587
All right, Tina. This is all you.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.130
Just like unscrewing a lightbulb.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.341
-Maybe this will help you.
-My sash.

19:34.424 --> 19:37.302
You knew I was always a Thundergirl
deep down and would want it back.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.054
No. This is satin, woman.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.722
You don't just throw away satin.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.516
Maybe Thundergirls aren't completely
useless in the wild.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.602
Maybe a bit of Thundergirl resourcefulness

19:45.685 --> 19:47.854
and a little bit of survivalist
weaponized insects

19:47.937 --> 19:49.731
make for a perfect s'more of ideas.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.524
Turns out I'm a Thunder-vivalist.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.526
-Tina, shush! Just do it!
-Oh, yeah, sorry.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.700
Thundergirl in the hole.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.411
Ah! Oh! Bees.

20:03.495 --> 20:05.914
-Whoa!
-Ah! They've weaponized insects.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.707
They took a page out of our own book.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.042
Page 17.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.753
I'm getting stung!

20:11.836 --> 20:13.004
That was your plan?

20:13.088 --> 20:13.922
You're welcome.

20:14.005 --> 20:15.006
I'll Mace them!

20:15.090 --> 20:16.925
Oops.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.426
Camping is fun!

20:18.510 --> 20:19.719
Go, go. In the car.

20:19.803 --> 20:20.762
Bobby, your stuff.

20:20.845 --> 20:21.846
Forget the stuff.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.307
-Gene, grab my Nature Master.
-Mm-hm.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.146
You can't Mace a guy.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.023
Oh, well, you know what else you can't do?

20:32.107 --> 20:35.151
You can't take your wife camping
for 40 months!

20:35.235 --> 20:37.654
You're right, honey. Come here.
Come over here.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.988
Yeah.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.201
Here, Tina. It's a patch for keeping
Mom and Dad alive.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.912
I don't think this'll count
as an official patch but thank you.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.997
You did the Thundergirls proud, honey.

20:48.081 --> 20:51.001
And I never left them ever.
And no one can say I did.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.544
-Dad, your underpants.
-Thank you.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.713
Perfect underwear, perfect weekend.

20:54.796 --> 20:57.048
Uh, this isn't my underwear.
