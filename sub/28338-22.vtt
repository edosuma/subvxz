really do anything.

then it doesn't matter
if it's cool or not.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.250
So I'm gonna
jump this cliff,

09:01.250 --> 09:03.420
not because it's cool,

09:03.420 --> 09:06.000
but because
I like jumping cliffs!

09:06.000 --> 09:08.420
[fart]

09:08.420 --> 09:11.290
Dude, did you just fart?

09:12.500 --> 09:14.080
[engine starts]

09:15.790 --> 09:18.380
I did!

09:18.380 --> 09:20.750
Man, that guy is so cool.

09:20.750 --> 09:24.040
-[cheering]
-Thank you. Thank you.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.540
Tom's not really
thinking about doing
the jump, right?

09:26.540 --> 09:28.380
I-- I really hope not.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.380
You ready, Hampton?

09:30.380 --> 09:32.000
Let's shred some sky.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.920
[roaring]

09:34.920 --> 09:38.080
[Tom]
Wow. They're so free.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.540
You just wanna be up there,
don't ya?

09:40.540 --> 09:42.500
[whimpering]

09:42.500 --> 09:44.330
Hey, what's he doing?

09:44.330 --> 09:46.750
Something pretty cool.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.580
Ughh!

09:48.580 --> 09:49.880
What are we doing?

09:49.880 --> 09:51.540
You don't wanna
do this jump.

09:51.540 --> 09:53.750
I don't
wanna do this jump.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.540
Hampton, I'm sorry.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.750
You should do
what you want.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.880
Rrrr?

09:59.880 --> 10:01.790
Be free!

10:07.120 --> 10:09.790
Have fun with
those wild dragon cycles, buddy.

10:09.790 --> 10:13.120
[Marco] Hey, Tom! I'm not
sure what just happened,

10:13.120 --> 10:15.790
but I'll come back
to pick you up!

10:15.790 --> 10:17.500
That's cool, Marco.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.500
I have my own way.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.620
[grunting]

10:22.170 --> 10:24.830
Rrrr! Ahh-haa!

10:24.830 --> 10:26.210
Ha ha!

10:26.210 --> 10:27.920
Oh, yeah, he can fly!

10:27.920 --> 10:29.500
-Way to go, Tom!
-[cheering]

10:29.500 --> 10:30.540
Whoo!

10:32.290 --> 10:34.040
[smash]

10:34.040 --> 10:36.920
Ohh! Why did I do that?

10:36.920 --> 10:39.330
You took that hit
like a total champ!

10:39.330 --> 10:41.120
Now let's see
that Devil Mark!

10:41.120 --> 10:43.120
Ohh, right.
Let's see here.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.250
Oh, thank goodness.

10:46.250 --> 10:47.710
He ain't nothin'
but bruises!

10:47.710 --> 10:49.170
You may not have
a dragon cycle,

10:49.170 --> 10:50.540
but you definitely
earned this.

10:50.540 --> 10:52.420
I'm part of the club!?

10:52.420 --> 10:55.830
Maybe next year,
you'll get one
of these bad boys.

10:55.830 --> 10:58.000
Check it out.
It's embossed in the back.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.500
Oh. Lucky.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.960
So you coming back
next year?

11:01.960 --> 11:03.250
We'll see.

11:03.250 --> 11:06.210
I think I'm just gonna
do what I want.

11:06.210 --> 11:08.670
But-- but, no, I'm definitely
not gonna do this again.
