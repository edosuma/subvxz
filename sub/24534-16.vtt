01:27.080 --> 01:28.741
Morgan? June? Do you copy?

01:31.960 --> 01:33.837
Morgan? June?

01:34.300 --> 01:35.619
Do you copy?

01:37.760 --> 01:39.296
I got out through the basement.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.676
Had to hole up in a post office
for the night.

01:42.770 --> 01:46.683
I'm in a parking garage
a couple miles south of the hospital.

01:47.230 --> 01:49.050
If you...

02:08.870 --> 02:10.622
You've got to be shitting me.

03:40.010 --> 03:40.874
Shit.

03:42.130 --> 03:43.677
He's strong now.

03:44.090 --> 03:45.136
Where is everyone else?

03:45.300 --> 03:46.631
What did you do to them?

03:47.970 --> 03:49.267
You took my tapes.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.970
You took my van.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.436
You owe me.

03:53.020 --> 03:54.351
I don't want to hurt you.

03:55.730 --> 03:56.890
I like you.

03:58.070 --> 03:59.810
You don't make people weak.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.020
Lady, I don't know what that means.

04:02.530 --> 04:04.270
I watched your interviews.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.487
So many people needing something.

04:08.200 --> 04:13.490
But you? You just gave them
whatever it took to get their story.

04:15.290 --> 04:16.416
Nothing more.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.205
That's real strength.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.369
Where are my tapes?

04:19.550 --> 04:20.699
Where's my van?

04:21.130 --> 04:22.006
Where are they?

04:22.510 --> 04:25.502
IfI know Morgan, he's looking for you.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.554
I want you to give him a message
when he finds you.

04:31.850 --> 04:33.135
I'm not telling him shit.

04:34.230 --> 04:37.472
You got a message, tell him yourself.

04:38.150 --> 04:39.356
All right.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.424
Al?

05:14.690 --> 05:15.554
Al?

05:16.850 --> 05:17.726
Al?

05:21.690 --> 05:22.850
Where, where is sh...

05:22.990 --> 05:25.140
Where... What... What happened?
Where is she?

05:25.280 --> 05:28.113
- Who?
- The woman who's trying to kill us.

05:29.030 --> 05:31.282
You were in the street.
We didn't see her.

05:31.370 --> 05:32.780
We heard you over the walkie.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.865
Then we went to that parking garage.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.166
And when we didn't find you,

05:36.250 --> 05:39.458
we figured you must have doubled back
to the hospital and tried to find us.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.085
I saw Jim.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.551
Did everyone else make it?

05:52.770 --> 05:53.805
We're all here.

05:54.430 --> 05:57.479
We're just circling the wagons
before we make the push to Virginia.

06:00.310 --> 06:01.720
What did she say to you?

06:03.860 --> 06:05.100
Bitch said she liked me.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.190
Wanted me to deliver a message.

06:09.990 --> 06:11.196
I demurred.

06:12.200 --> 06:17.649
Well, she delivered it anyway.

06:19.750 --> 06:22.913
She kind of made you her carrier pigeon.

06:24.130 --> 06:25.006
What?

06:25.960 --> 06:29.509
I am so disappointed in you, Morgan.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.212
Iga ve you so many chances to be strong.

06:35.060 --> 06:37.176
But you o’io’n ’t take any of them.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.181
But maybe it was my fault.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.891
Maybe .7 wasn ’t strong enough.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.562
You 7/ see me again, and when you do,

06:51.780 --> 06:53.941
I’// be stronger than ever.

06:55.330 --> 06:58.902
And [7/ make you strong, too. 1' mil.

07:12.720 --> 07:13.709
So, Mo-Mo,

07:14.970 --> 07:15.959
you finally going to tell us

07:16.060 --> 07:18.631
where the hell in Virginia
we're actually going?

07:23.060 --> 07:24.470
It's called Alexandria.

07:28.610 --> 07:31.192
And there's a few places
more or less nearby.

07:31.990 --> 07:33.230
Place with the king?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.155
Uh-huh.

07:35.660 --> 07:36.695
Pet tiger?

07:38.040 --> 07:38.904
We'll go there.

07:41.580 --> 07:42.911
How's the patient?

07:44.130 --> 07:45.336
Better now.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.661
Found a truck
with a full tank. On our way back.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.334
Copy.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.599
It appears we'll be arriving
in Alexandria via caravan.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.386
Well, we're going to need the extra room.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.722
Thought we'd make a stop
where we first met,

07:59.810 --> 08:01.300
Polar Bear's truck stop.

08:01.390 --> 08:03.893
We load up the boxes,
and we'll drop them on the road,

08:04.020 --> 08:05.260
whole way to Virginia.

08:06.270 --> 08:07.601
Well, we should get some sleep.

08:07.980 --> 08:09.390
We hit the road at dawn.

08:10.570 --> 08:11.696
Let's pack it in.

08:16.780 --> 08:18.782
Maybe .7 wasn ’t strong enough.

08:20.620 --> 08:23.032
But don ’t worry. I wﬂi be.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.705
I can take over.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.416
When did...

08:28.840 --> 08:31.161
Nature called. I answered.

08:34.220 --> 08:36.290
I expected to find you walking away.

08:37.140 --> 08:40.553
I thought I was
going to have to jog after you

08:40.720 --> 08:43.052
just to tell you
that I know what you're up to.

08:43.980 --> 08:45.299
What am I up to, John?

08:46.400 --> 08:47.856
Oh, you're going to run again.

08:49.230 --> 08:50.720
You found a reason to leave us.

08:50.820 --> 08:52.310
No. It's not...

08:53.610 --> 08:55.191
It's not running.

08:57.660 --> 08:59.025
She's dying, John.

09:02.120 --> 09:05.112
We already tried to help her.
She don't want it.

09:05.210 --> 09:08.088
She thinks the only way to be strong
is to die and turn.

09:08.170 --> 09:10.126
She tried to kill you.
She tried to kill June.

09:10.210 --> 09:11.086
She's stuck.

09:11.170 --> 09:14.162
Whatever happened to her,
she thinks killing is the only way.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.289
How you going to convince her otherwise?

09:18.390 --> 09:20.551
Because I understand her. I...

09:25.390 --> 09:26.641
I used to be her.

09:33.570 --> 09:35.856
- I'll come with you.
- No. No, this is...

09:36.070 --> 09:38.868
this is something
I've got to do on my own.

09:39.950 --> 09:42.612
All of you, you go here.

09:43.370 --> 09:45.827
This is how you get there, to Alexandria.

09:45.910 --> 09:47.912
I put it on paper just in case.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.706
- Oh, come on.
- You heard me, John.

09:55.300 --> 09:56.585
Got to do this on my own.

09:56.970 --> 09:59.291
Now, you told me
something like that once before.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.249
You almost got yourself killed.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.637
Now you're going to go off
and do the exact same thing again?

10:05.350 --> 10:06.226
Why?

10:07.190 --> 10:08.509
Why?

10:12.610 --> 10:13.770
Because I do.

10:16.070 --> 10:20.655
Man, that sounds like
she's not the only one who's stuck.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.070
I will get to Alexandria.

10:32.210 --> 10:33.791
I will meet you all there.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.622
Hopefully, with her.

10:42.050 --> 10:43.711
I'm going to wait
at that truck stop.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.267
I bet everyone else will, too.

10:47.430 --> 10:49.011
You don't come back inside of two days,

10:49.900 --> 10:51.356
I'm going to come looking for you.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.759
I will be there.

10:55.820 --> 10:58.857
You know, there are some fish
in this world, just won't be caught,

11:00.200 --> 11:02.020
no matter what you
dangle in front of them.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.360
You could go after them, sure.

11:06.910 --> 11:09.037
My gut tells me just to leave them be.

11:14.460 --> 11:18.044
Now, I'm talking about fish, in this case.

11:19.260 --> 11:21.296
But I think it applies to this woman, too.

11:22.010 --> 11:23.420
I still got to try, though.

11:25.470 --> 11:27.961
I know. I know you do.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.431
You know, hell, you might be the fish.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.271
Maybe I am.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.170
I know you're listening.

12:12.640 --> 12:16.053
And I know you think this is the only way
that you can be strong.

12:16.940 --> 12:19.647
But I'm telling you there's another way.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.316
Let me show you.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.696
Let me try to.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.194
Morgan?

12:30.160 --> 12:32.242
I knew you’d come looking.

12:35.460 --> 12:36.324
Where are you?

12:37.000 --> 12:41.118
M/ie marker 54.

12:46.930 --> 12:48.090
I'm on my way.

13:41.110 --> 13:42.099
Thank you.

14:08.510 --> 14:10.250
Are we really doing this?

14:12.810 --> 14:14.630
We could always
go back to the mansion.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.722
The Chteau Laﬁte is waiting for us.

14:18.060 --> 14:19.266
It's gone.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.186
There's nothing for us back there.

14:21.270 --> 14:23.010
So let's find something else to do.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.896
Let's find another reason to live.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.528
What?

14:43.960 --> 14:45.257
Oh, now.

14:46.340 --> 14:47.216
Come on.

14:48.090 --> 14:48.966
What?

14:49.680 --> 14:52.046
It's just, reminds me
of shopping at Bill's.

14:53.180 --> 14:55.671
Have you seen the movie selection here?

14:56.730 --> 14:59.096
I don't think we'll be getting back
to Bill's anytime soon.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.259
Or my cabin.

15:01.350 --> 15:03.932
Storm pretty much made that
a near certainty.

15:04.940 --> 15:06.066
Hey.

15:07.780 --> 15:11.523
Before the storm,
when you asked ifI wanted to go...

15:11.620 --> 15:13.110
No, that... That doesn't matter, June.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.690
No. I want you to hear this.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.829
I was scared that you'd realise that
I wasn't who you thought I was.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.127
A lot has happened between then and now.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.449
I know who you are.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.540
Doesn't matter what your name is.

15:33.260 --> 15:34.249
I know you.

15:36.770 --> 15:37.668
I know you.

15:40.020 --> 15:42.477
Doesn't take a whole day
to recognise sunshine.

15:49.110 --> 15:52.273
Well, I wanted you to know
that I know who I am now.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.810
You gave that to me.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.360
I didn't even know it.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.149
I needed to.

16:02.210 --> 16:03.825
I needed you, John.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.476
You armed?

17:58.820 --> 17:59.866
Hey.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.875
Not yet.

18:14.670 --> 18:15.546
My people,

18:16.970 --> 18:18.335
we can help you.

18:28.810 --> 18:30.141
No.

18:32.230 --> 18:35.188
No. Not yet. No!

18:35.280 --> 18:37.350
There's no time. I'm taking you back.

18:51.790 --> 18:52.836
No!

18:58.720 --> 19:01.132
- Hey--
- You weren't supposed to see me like this.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.296
Hey.

19:03.390 --> 19:04.550
You're going to take these.

19:06.470 --> 19:08.017
They'll clear up the infection.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.719
So, what was that place?

19:16.780 --> 19:18.179
What happened back there?

19:22.280 --> 19:23.360
Who'd you lose?

19:27.830 --> 19:29.115
It's a long trip.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.490
Thought talking might help.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.376
Morgan, do you copy?

19:35.460 --> 19:38.008
Morgan, 1 repeat; do you copy?

19:38.420 --> 19:39.409
John, I copy.

19:41.050 --> 19:41.926
I found her.

19:42.590 --> 19:44.251
I'm bringing her back.

19:51.390 --> 19:54.052
Where are you taking me?

19:55.820 --> 19:57.310
To Mississippi.

19:58.610 --> 20:00.020
John, do you copy?

20:02.030 --> 20:02.940
John?

20:06.120 --> 20:08.236
Morgan, I repeat, do you copy?

20:10.750 --> 20:12.035
I never should have let him go.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.451
You saw the transmitter outside.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.668
That baby's 50 watts.
If he's got ears, he can hear you.

20:19.550 --> 20:21.927
But there's no way his
signal's getting back here,

20:23.130 --> 20:25.086
at least not until he gets closer.

20:29.930 --> 20:32.387
Told Wendell to lay off the sweetener.

20:36.190 --> 20:37.396
How's it going up there?

20:38.940 --> 20:40.737
This ought to get us to Virginia.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.022
Smiley rode the engine without coolant.

20:44.820 --> 20:47.698
Care to channel that anger
into something a bit more productive?

20:49.080 --> 20:51.150
We could use some help with the boxes.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.500
Got these.

21:16.270 --> 21:17.396
Al?

21:21.440 --> 21:22.520
Al!

21:32.910 --> 21:34.821
Al? Okay.

21:35.710 --> 21:37.075
Come on.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.876
Better get inside.

21:42.590 --> 21:44.080
We're going to have more company.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.185
My husband.

22:11.740 --> 22:13.037
What was his name?

22:16.370 --> 22:17.246
Hank.

22:20.590 --> 22:21.955
What happened to him?

22:24.380 --> 22:27.258
Back when everything was starting,

22:29.140 --> 22:31.256
we were trying to get out of the city.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.675
I was driving.

22:36.560 --> 22:42.100
_ _Someone was _
weavmg In and out of the traffic,

22:45.740 --> 22:47.310
trying to get ahead,

22:48.700 --> 22:50.361
trying to get theirs.

22:53.450 --> 22:54.826
And they clipped me.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.069
My Hank,

22:59.580 --> 23:01.241
he needed my help.

23:03.250 --> 23:05.627
And I didn't know what to do.

23:06.710 --> 23:11.249
I went out to the road,
tried to flag someone down.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.091
But no one stopped.

23:16.350 --> 23:19.808
No one pulled over to help.

23:19.890 --> 23:21.266
And that is not your fault.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.187
He needed me to be strong.

23:24.980 --> 23:26.060
And I wasn't.

23:26.150 --> 23:27.811
Hey, I know that's what you think.

23:29.860 --> 23:31.350
But that isn't true.

23:32.490 --> 23:33.366
You're...

23:35.990 --> 23:37.366
you are stuck.

23:40.080 --> 23:44.369
Morgan,
if you can hear this, please hurry back.

23:44.460 --> 23:46.121
Something’s wrong.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.125
Al got sick.

23:49.010 --> 23:52.548
We thought it was
what she had before.

23:52.640 --> 23:56.804
But it's not just her.

23:56.890 --> 23:58.767
It's all of us.

24:06.230 --> 24:09.859
Morgan, something's not right.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.691
Please, if you hear this...

24:19.700 --> 24:20.780
Can you hear me?

24:22.580 --> 24:25.743
If you can hear me,
I'm on my way back, okay?

24:25.960 --> 24:27.791
I am on my way back.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.176
You hang on.

24:37.260 --> 24:38.557
I can't.

24:39.140 --> 24:40.596
Just pull over.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.557
There's no time. I need to get back.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.437
- Pull over.
- I said I can't!

24:44.520 --> 24:49.059
Okay, okay. I'll take the damn medicine.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.230
Here.

25:10.550 --> 25:13.337
I told you not...

25:17.390 --> 25:18.880
I told you

25:18.970 --> 25:21.302
I was going to make you strong.

25:25.100 --> 25:28.854
I think, Morgan,
that's what you always wanted.

26:13.860 --> 26:15.851
It doesn't have to end this way for us.

26:25.620 --> 26:26.951
It does for me.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.292
I made sure you couldn't help.

26:35.510 --> 26:39.139
Now, you either kill me, or I kill you.

26:42.930 --> 26:44.010
I don't kill.

26:59.780 --> 27:01.020
I got to get to them.

27:01.120 --> 27:01.984
You'll never make it.

27:02.070 --> 27:03.196
I got to try.

27:03.530 --> 27:04.690
- Why?
- What?

27:06.040 --> 27:07.359
It's not for them.

27:08.250 --> 27:09.410
It's for you.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.120
You're scared.

27:11.670 --> 27:12.785
If they die...

27:13.040 --> 27:13.916
Morgan?

27:14.460 --> 27:16.257
...you'll become what you used to be.

27:17.380 --> 27:19.678
That's why you left that place back east,

27:20.090 --> 27:22.172
- before.
- Morgan, p/ease hurry back.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.341
That's why you came
to find me on your own.

27:28.430 --> 27:30.842
I came to find you
because you needed help.

27:31.690 --> 27:33.226
You knew I wouldn't take it.

27:36.530 --> 27:39.772
I have been where you are. I have.

27:39.860 --> 27:41.157
Morgan, are you there?

27:41.240 --> 27:42.309
You still are.

27:42.700 --> 27:44.941
Whatever this is,
it’s getting worse.

27:45.030 --> 27:48.909
You always will be
unless you decide to be strong.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.456
Morgan?

27:52.170 --> 27:53.285
Morgan?

27:55.130 --> 28:00.375
Now, you either kill me,
and become what you used to be,

28:00.510 --> 28:03.582
or you let me make you strong.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.437
What the hell is this?

28:13.560 --> 28:16.893
We just need to stay hydrated.

28:34.290 --> 28:35.166
No.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.626
No. No.

28:53.140 --> 28:56.303
These bottles,
all of the seals have been broken.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.736
Someone poisoned us.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.155
She did.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.788
Morgan. Morgan, she did this.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.041
She put something in the water.

29:21.010 --> 29:22.204
Is that true?

29:22.510 --> 29:25.172
Last time I was there, I did.

29:25.840 --> 29:29.628
I didn't know you
and your friends were going to stop.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.136
It's like I was saying.

29:33.270 --> 29:36.433
That's what you get for helping people.

29:36.980 --> 29:39.562
You made them weak, Morgan.

29:39.650 --> 29:42.107
What did you do? What is it?

29:42.190 --> 29:43.487
It doesn't matter.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.901
There's nothing you can do.

29:45.990 --> 29:47.196
What is it?

29:47.910 --> 29:48.774
What?

29:52.200 --> 29:53.747
Antifreeze.

29:58.750 --> 29:59.626
God!

30:00.710 --> 30:02.450
She put antifreeze in the water.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.120
Do you copy? It's antifreeze.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.461
- They can't hear you.
- Oh, God.

30:06.550 --> 30:08.506
You can't help them.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.506
Don't you understand?

30:12.180 --> 30:14.557
They are going to die.

30:15.140 --> 30:19.395
And there is nothing you can do about it.

30:24.900 --> 30:26.231
Now you're strong.

30:32.450 --> 30:34.361
I knew it was still in you.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.669
I won't.

30:56.350 --> 30:57.510
They're going to die.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.055
And there's nothing you can do.

31:05.480 --> 31:06.731
Yes, there is.

31:27.130 --> 31:28.870
You're going to be strong.

31:29.930 --> 31:31.420
We both will.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.005
You'll see.

31:40.520 --> 31:41.839
What are you doing?

31:42.230 --> 31:45.688
No! No!

31:47.940 --> 31:48.929
Listen.

31:50.530 --> 31:51.906
I won't kill you.

31:52.450 --> 31:55.942
But I'm also not going to let you
kill anybody after you've turned.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.577
It's not supposed to be this way.

31:59.290 --> 32:02.623
It's not supposed to be this way!

32:03.040 --> 32:06.498
It's not supposed to be this way!

32:36.160 --> 32:37.445
Anybody hear me?

32:38.870 --> 32:40.906
I repeat, can anybody hear me?

32:59.850 --> 33:00.760
Anybody copy?

33:03.520 --> 33:05.476
Come on. Does anybody copy?

35:43.680 --> 35:45.341
Does anybody hear me?

36:15.500 --> 36:17.877
I'm not going to let that bitch beat me.

36:23.010 --> 36:26.673
Morgan, you're out there,

36:29.770 --> 36:31.806
you tell her I'm coming for her.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.470
- Al? Al?
- I don’tknow how.

36:47.370 --> 36:48.735
- ButI wﬂi.
- Al?

36:49.660 --> 36:50.740
Do you copy?

36:51.660 --> 36:52.911
Al, do you copy?

37:00.590 --> 37:01.466
Yeah.

37:02.090 --> 37:03.500
What took you so long?

37:03.760 --> 37:04.829
Oh, thank God.

37:04.930 --> 37:08.002
It's antifreeze, okay?
It's antifreeze.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.015
Ethanol.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.049
The antidote is ethanol.

37:13.730 --> 37:16.142
It'll stop us
from metabolising the antifreeze.

37:17.940 --> 37:23.105
There's a goddamn tanker truck
full of it crashed outside.

37:25.070 --> 37:27.061
All we got to do is get to it.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.076
Well, what are we waiting for?

37:43.470 --> 37:45.461
We're going to be okay.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.170
You just get your ass back here.

37:50.970 --> 37:52.301
I'm on my way.

37:55.690 --> 37:56.759
Come on!

38:11.620 --> 38:12.735
Everybody ready?

38:14.750 --> 38:15.819
We're ready.

38:20.170 --> 38:21.626
Let's stir up some beef.

38:37.390 --> 38:38.266
Now.

39:01.630 --> 39:02.995
John, come on.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.120
Incoming!

39:11.550 --> 39:12.756
Ow!

39:15.520 --> 39:16.885
- Come on.
- To the truck.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.550
We need to get you back inside.

39:35.330 --> 39:36.194
It's stuck.

39:36.370 --> 39:37.689
Come on. Hurry.

39:41.830 --> 39:43.161
I can't get it.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.433
Get down!

40:52.450 --> 40:54.099
How’s it a// going over there?

41:00.410 --> 41:04.119
Morgan, we lost the ethanol.

41:04.750 --> 41:06.786
There was
a whole truck full of it outside.

41:07.790 --> 41:09.291
It was going to save us.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.080
Hey, but there's got to be more, right?

41:12.720 --> 41:13.675
There isn ’t.

41:14.220 --> 41:18.133
Even if there was, I don't think any of us
are in any shape to get it.

41:19.560 --> 41:22.518
No, no, you got to find a way.

41:23.190 --> 41:24.384
Morgan, it’s John.

41:26.060 --> 41:27.800
I don't think that's going to happen, bud.

41:31.860 --> 41:33.145
No, see...

41:36.030 --> 41:39.579
I can't lose you.
I can't lose any of you.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.377
I can't go back to what I was.

41:48.630 --> 41:49.915
You won ’t.

41:51.420 --> 41:53.411
I did. I almost did.

41:54.840 --> 41:56.330
But you didn't.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.171
I wﬂi.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.011
You see, she was right.

42:06.100 --> 42:08.807
I'm not... I'm not strong enough.

42:11.650 --> 42:14.187
You're the strongest person
I know, Morgan.

42:16.400 --> 42:20.518
Whether we ’re here or not
you ’re 5177/ going to be you.

42:27.330 --> 42:29.070
And people out there need you.

42:30.090 --> 42:31.284
It's not like...

42:32.550 --> 42:33.756
John?

42:34.710 --> 42:35.586
John?

43:18.470 --> 43:20.176
Whoever finds these,

43:22.800 --> 43:24.210
keep them safe.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.437
Make sure they survive.

43:30.150 --> 43:31.515
Make sure they matter.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.981
What's the final count?

43:41.200 --> 43:45.239
How many of those meat puppets
we take out?

43:47.910 --> 43:49.400
Not enough.

43:53.290 --> 43:56.202
Just when I stopped trying
to drink myself to death,

43:57.960 --> 43:59.416
I succeed.

44:01.050 --> 44:02.039
Ithought

44:04.010 --> 44:05.500
we would get a chance

44:07.520 --> 44:09.806
to make up for what we did.

44:12.850 --> 44:14.932
I thought I'd get a second chance.

44:16.820 --> 44:19.527
At least I got to see the beach.

44:22.030 --> 44:23.190
Yeah, you did.

44:57.270 --> 44:58.430
Morgan.

45:05.660 --> 45:06.979
You came back.

45:07.990 --> 45:09.651
Yeah, I told you I would.

45:14.750 --> 45:17.742
Ethanol, that's just a fancy word
for alcohol, right?

45:18.340 --> 45:19.204
Yeah.

45:21.380 --> 45:23.211
I made a stop along the way.

45:34.810 --> 45:37.472
That's twice Jimbo's saved our keisters.

45:39.440 --> 45:41.180
Here's to you, asshole.

45:48.530 --> 45:49.519
You know,

45:50.410 --> 45:52.071
there was a time I thought

45:53.200 --> 45:55.748
I didn't have anyone
to share a drink with anymore.

46:12.680 --> 46:14.887
Charlie, you know
this is a one-time deal, right?

46:16.100 --> 46:17.761
She was poisoned, John.

46:17.850 --> 46:18.760
I know.

46:18.980 --> 46:22.723
Just don't go getting poisoned again
till you're at least 21.

46:25.740 --> 46:26.604
Yeah?

46:38.710 --> 46:39.699
I get it.

46:41.460 --> 46:43.542
I get why this is what you wanted.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.118
Morgan, can we get our asses in gear,
and get to Alexandria now?

48:45.630 --> 48:46.915
We're not going there.

48:53.130 --> 48:54.256
At least, I'm not.

48:56.220 --> 48:58.802
That woman, she was the way she was

48:58.890 --> 49:02.439
because nobody stopped to help her
when she needed it, nobody.

49:03.730 --> 49:06.051
And there are still more people
like her out there.

49:07.610 --> 49:09.020
You see, Polar Bear was...

49:16.120 --> 49:19.192
His journals, you still got them?

49:20.620 --> 49:21.655
Yeah.

49:46.810 --> 49:49.438
When Polar Bear started doing
what he was doing,

49:50.400 --> 49:52.482
he tried to set up a system that'd last.

49:55.700 --> 49:57.520
The supplies, the fuel,

49:58.870 --> 50:01.998
even those trucks at the truck stop,
they all came from here.

50:07.500 --> 50:08.990
This is where it all started.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.455
Used to be a denim factory.

50:12.090 --> 50:16.709
He said he used to make
deliveries for them, you now, before.

50:17.470 --> 50:20.849
And then after, he set up shop here

50:20.930 --> 50:23.808
because look at it.

50:25.850 --> 50:27.056
So out of the way.

50:28.900 --> 50:31.892
_ I don't need
a new pair of dungarees, Mo-Mo.

50:32.280 --> 50:33.770
That wasn't our deal, man.

50:34.320 --> 50:37.448
Well, look,
nobody is being forced to stay.

50:40.830 --> 50:43.071
You want to make up
for what you did to Clayton?

50:46.290 --> 50:47.496
This is where you start.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.927
Morgan, it can't just be about the boxes.

50:59.590 --> 51:03.219
We have to do what my mom did,
build this into something more.

51:05.310 --> 51:07.050
That's how you help people.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.720
And where are we
going to find these people?

51:12.190 --> 51:15.068
They're in short supply,
in case we hadn't noticed.

51:18.650 --> 51:19.560
Got tapes.

51:21.030 --> 51:23.612
Interviews with people all over the area.

51:25.240 --> 51:27.151
Some of them weren't doing so hot.

51:28.120 --> 51:29.280
Start with them.

51:37.590 --> 51:38.579
What?

51:42.850 --> 51:43.885
I got layers.

52:09.500 --> 52:10.785
You think we'll find him there?

52:12.040 --> 52:13.837
I think it's a good place to start.

52:16.460 --> 52:17.336
Ready?

52:18.970 --> 52:19.834
Ready.

52:20.720 --> 52:21.835
Now we good.

52:23.260 --> 52:24.500
Let's boogie.

52:36.520 --> 52:37.521
We're ready.

52:38.070 --> 52:39.059
Let's go.

52:58.050 --> 53:00.507
_ Don't know
If any of you are out there.

53:01.340 --> 53:03.251
Don't know if any of you are listening.

53:03.800 --> 53:06.678
But if you are, hang in there.

53:06.850 --> 53:08.249
We're coming for you.
