more than a bump on the head.

Please, don't get mad.

They say the heater caused the fire.

And l did a terrible thing.

30:37.202 --> 30:38.369
What's that?

30:38.469 --> 30:42.307
l lied. Ty asked me
if l used the heater last night,

30:42.407 --> 30:45.577
and l said l didn't, but l did,
but l turned it off.

30:45.677 --> 30:50.181
l swear l did. lt's just...
l may not have unplugged it.

30:50.281 --> 30:54.385
Would that cause a fire, Jack?
lf it was still plugged in?

30:54.485 --> 30:59.081
Not much chance of that.
- Oh, my God, are you sure?

30:59.224 --> 31:01.025

you have to believe me.

everything was fine.

There's damage to the roof.

how we're going to afford it.

starting to come out of the woods,

Tell me about the stones, Granddad.

32:55.440 --> 32:59.433
Well, my grandfather built that hearth.

32:59.544 --> 33:01.679
Each one of those stones
was hand-picked...

33:01.779 --> 33:03.815
...from the fields around here.

33:03.915 --> 33:06.635
They're all a part of Heartland.

33:08.252 --> 33:13.352
This one is grandma, and this one
is you, and this one is me.

33:13.624 --> 33:17.228
That's right. And that fireplace
will still be there...

33:17.328 --> 33:23.363
...when you're as old as l am and
when your children's children are too.

33:23.868 --> 33:28.931
You gotta hold on to this place, Jack.
Promise me that.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.240
l promise, Granddad.

33:38.216 --> 33:40.980
l promise, Granddad.

34:04.108 --> 34:06.377
The night of the fire,
your grandfather sustained an injury...

34:06.477 --> 34:09.847
...that put pressure on his brain,
a subdural hematoma.

34:09.947 --> 34:13.518
Sometimes the effects aren't felt
until a few days after the injury.

34:13.618 --> 34:15.353
lf the pressure does not abate,

34:15.453 --> 34:18.322
the oxygenated blood may not
reach all areas of the brain.

34:18.422 --> 34:21.984
ln that case,
the brain tissue may die.

34:22.092 --> 34:23.194
And if it does?

34:23.293 --> 34:25.129
We're making sure that doesn't happen.

34:25.228 --> 34:27.532
What we're doing now
is alleviating the pressure.

34:27.632 --> 34:28.666
And once that is accomplished,

34:28.766 --> 34:31.601
we're going to slowly let him
regain consciousness.

My advice to you is to go home
and get some rest.

34:35.540 --> 34:39.237

on him. Okay?
