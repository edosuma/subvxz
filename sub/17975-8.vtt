I THOUGHT YOU NEVER WANTED

09:54.469 --> 09:59.433

09:59.474 --> 10:04.062
WE WERE TOGETHER

09:59.474 --> 10:04.062

10:04.104 --> 10:08.275
WE WERE ENGAGED.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.528

11:29.397 --> 11:30.607
HARRY BOOKED

11:29.397 --> 11:30.607

I'M SURE

11:41.242 --> 11:42.869
IT WILL BE TIT,

11:42.910 --> 11:44.162
AND I AM SURE

11:44.204 --> 11:45.580
THAT YOU WILL

11:44.204 --> 11:45.580
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND

11:45.622 --> 11:47.706
WHY WE WON'T

11:45.622 --> 11:47.706
BE THERE.

11:47.748 --> 11:48.707
THAT'S TOO BAD.

11:48.749 --> 11:49.708

I COULD DESCRIBE

11:53.171 --> 11:54.631
WHAT IT

11:53.171 --> 11:54.631
FEELS LIKE.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.216
IT'S...IT'S...

11:56.257 --> 11:57.467
IT'S OKAY.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.468
WE CAN USE OUR IMAGINATIONS,

11:57.509 --> 11:58.468
REALLY.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.844
PRIMAL.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.221
FEMALES IN

11:59.886 --> 12:01.221
THE ANIMAL KINGDOM,

12:01.262 --> 12:02.430
THEY DO THIS

12:01.262 --> 12:02.430
WHEN THEY'RE GESTATING.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.641
YOU BECOME

12:02.472 --> 12:04.641
A HOMEBODY.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.767
YOU JUST RETREAT,

12:04.683 --> 12:06.767

GIN PALACE

12:11.898 --> 12:13.024

12:13.066 --> 12:14.401
SO YOU CAN GO HOME

12:13.066 --> 12:14.401
AND SIT ON AN EGG?

12:14.442 --> 12:15.902
I MEAN, IS THIS

12:55.149 --> 12:57.193
SORRY I'M SO LATE, SWEETIE!

12:57.235 --> 12:58.236
I WAS JUST PULLING OUT

12:57.235 --> 12:58.236
OF THE GARAGE

12:58.278 --> 12:59.529
WHEN I REALIZED I FORGOT

12:59.571 --> 13:00.947
THE THREE NEW

12:59.571 --> 13:00.947
NATURAL CHILDBIRTH BOOKS

13:00.988 --> 13:02.490
WE WANT--

13:04.992 --> 13:07.036
W-WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:07.078 --> 13:08.829
I DON'T KNOW.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.665
THESE GUYS HAVE SOMETHING

13:08.871 --> 13:10.665
THEY WANT TO TALK TO US ABOUT.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.542
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE A SEAT

13:10.707 --> 13:12.542
NEXT TO TINA.

13:12.584 --> 13:13.585
CAN I JUST--

13:13.627 --> 13:14.586

WILL YOU PUT THAT

13:21.008 --> 13:22.719
IN THE FRIDGE?

13:22.761 --> 13:23.886
BECAUSE LEAVING

13:22.761 --> 13:23.886
HOT FOOD OUT

13:23.928 --> 13:25.764
IS WHAT BRINGS

13:23.928 --> 13:25.764
THE BACTERIA TO LIFE,

13:25.804 --> 13:26.805
AND TOXOPLASMOSIS

13:26.847 --> 13:28.475
IS ONE OF MOST

13:26.847 --> 13:28.475
PREVALENT CAUSES

13:28.516 --> 13:29.643
OF BIRTH DEFECTS.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.519
YOU GET IT FROM

13:29.684 --> 13:31.519
CONTAMINATED FOOD,

13:31.561 --> 13:33.647
UNPASTEURIZED CHEESE,

13:31.561 --> 13:33.647
AND...

13:33.688 --> 13:34.648
CATS. CATS...

13:34.689 --> 13:36.190
OUTDOOR CATS.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.151
SLANDER AGAINST CATS.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.151
WRITE THAT DOWN.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.527

13:42.029 --> 13:45.325
OKAY, HERE GOES.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.993

13:47.034 --> 13:48.411
YOUR FRIENDS

13:47.034 --> 13:48.411
AND FAMILY--

13:48.453 --> 13:49.954
BECAUSE WE REALLY DO

13:48.453 --> 13:49.954
CONSIDER YOU GUYS

13:49.996 --> 13:51.414
OUR FAMILY.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.750
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY

13:51.456 --> 13:53.750
WE WERE AT THAT...

13:53.792 --> 13:55.543
RITUAL THING--

13:55.585 --> 13:58.672
IS TO PERFORM

13:55.585 --> 13:58.672
AN INTERVENTION.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.674
LOOK, GUYS, MY COUSINS

13:58.713 --> 14:00.674
DID THIS FOR MY UNCLE BILL,

14:00.715 --> 14:02.049
AND HE HASN'T HAD

14:00.715 --> 14:02.049
A DROP TO DRINK

14:02.091 --> 14:03.259
SINCE THEY PUT HIM

14:02.091 --> 14:03.259
IN A STRAITJACKET

14:03.301 --> 14:04.511
AND HAULED HIM OFF TO REHAB.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.512
I SWEAR.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.430
THANK YOU

14:05.553 --> 14:07.430
FOR THAT, SHANE.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.015
SURE.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.099
NOW, I KNOW WHAT

14:09.056 --> 14:10.099
YOU'RE THINKING.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.184
WELL, THAT

14:10.141 --> 14:11.184
IS A RELIEF,

14:11.225 --> 14:13.269
BECAUSE I CAN

14:11.225 --> 14:13.269
SAFELY SAY

14:13.311 --> 14:14.688
THAT WE'RE BOTH JUST

14:13.311 --> 14:14.688
TOTALLY MYSTIFIED.

14:14.729 --> 14:18.191
AN INTERVENTION IS ABOUT

14:14.729 --> 14:18.191
HELPING PEOPLE YOU LOVE

14:18.232 --> 14:20.777
CHANGE DESTRUCTIVE

14:18.232 --> 14:20.777
PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.028
NOW, OVER THE PAST

14:20.819 --> 14:22.028
APPROXIMATELY...

14:22.069 --> 14:23.613

14:23.655 --> 14:25.156
12 WEEKS,

14:25.198 --> 14:27.074
WE'VE NOTICED

14:25.198 --> 14:27.074
A VERY ALARMING PATTERN.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.827
UM...

14:28.868 --> 14:32.038
YOU TWO ARE HAVING A BABY,

14:28.868 --> 14:32.038
AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.039

JUMP IN ANY TIME.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.544
OKAY, UM, GUYS...

14:37.585 --> 14:40.213
WE'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN

14:37.585 --> 14:40.213
WITH OTHER COUPLES

14:40.254 --> 14:41.381
THAT WE'VE KNOWN--

14:41.422 --> 14:42.632
JANET AND SUE,

14:41.422 --> 14:42.632
FOR INSTANCE,

14:42.674 --> 14:44.008

14:49.013 --> 14:51.265

I KNOW THIS

15:07.240 --> 15:08.449

15:08.491 --> 15:09.450
DENIAL'S VERY COMMON.

15:09.492 --> 15:10.702
IT'S OKAY.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.329
THAT'S WHY WE'VE

15:10.744 --> 15:13.329

43:58.595 --> 44:02.098

44:02.140 --> 44:04.476
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH TINA?

44:04.517 --> 44:05.726
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

44:04.517 --> 44:05.726
WHAT? WHAT?

44:05.768 --> 44:07.103
NO, NO.

44:05.768 --> 44:07.103
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.687

44:12.191 --> 44:13.568
SOME THINGS ON MY MIND,

44:13.610 --> 44:14.652
BUT IT'S NOTHING.

44:16.028 --> 44:18.156
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

44:21.493 --> 44:23.495
YOU'RE HAVING THE DADDY BLUES.

44:25.704 --> 44:27.039

44:34.631 --> 44:35.965
RESPONSIBILITIES...

44:36.007 --> 44:38.468
