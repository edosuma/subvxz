ABOUT ANY BOOK REPORTS.

THEIR OWN LUNCHES

09:46.367 --> 09:47.900
[MR. TURNER]
THERE'S ICE IN THE FREEZER.

09:47.900 --> 09:50.000
WE'RE FINE.
WE'RE O.K.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.867
HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

09:53.867 --> 09:55.900
IT'S NEXT WEEK'S
LESSON PLANS.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.300
WE CAN'T LOOK
AT THAT.

09:57.300 --> 10:00.367
YEAH, WELL,
I ALREADY SAW THEM.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.667
THEN LET ME SEE.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.133
"TUESDAY--POP QUIZ,

10:04.133 --> 10:06.867
CHAPS 8, 10 TO 16."

10:06.867 --> 10:09.033
DARN. IT'S IN CODE.

10:09.033 --> 10:11.867
WOW. I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS.

10:11.867 --> 10:13.233
THIS IS TOP-SECRET
INFORMATION--

10:13.233 --> 10:15.567
EXACTLY WHEN
THE POP QUIZ IS

10:15.567 --> 10:16.900
AND WHAT'S ON IT.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.300
THIS IS VERY VALUABLE.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.400
HEY, GUYS.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.000
PUT IT BACK.
PUT IT BACK.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
DO YOU THINK THIS SHIRT
OR THE ONE I'M WEARING?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.867
THE ONE YOU'RE
WEARING'S GOOD.

10:26.867 --> 10:28.900
DEFINITELY THE ONE
YOU'RE WEARING.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.100
ANYWAY, MR. TURNER,
WE HAVE TO GO.

10:38.100 --> 10:39.100
NO DRINKS?
NO DRINKS.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.967
WE'LL TAKE
A RAIN CHECK.

10:40.967 --> 10:43.667
MY BOOK'S DUE BACK,
AND I GOT TO REWIND IT.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.667
HA HA HA.
SEE YOU IN CLASS,
MR. TURNER.

10:50.967 --> 10:53.467
WE HAVE
NO RIGHT TO KNOW
WHAT WE FOUND OUT.

10:53.467 --> 10:55.100
WE KNOW
WHEN THERE'S A TEST.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.100
WE KNOW
WHAT TO STUDY.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.600
WE MIGHT GET GOOD GRADES.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.567
WE FINALLY BEAT
THE SYSTEM!

10:59.567 --> 11:00.600
YES!

11:14.867 --> 11:15.867
WHAT?

11:15.867 --> 11:17.000
YOU SPOOKED HIM.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.133
IF WE'RE GOING
TO HANG WITH SOMEBODY,

11:19.133 --> 11:20.567
HE SHOULD KNOW
WE'RE HERE.

11:20.567 --> 11:22.233
HARLEY DIDN'T KNOW
FOR MONTHS.

11:22.233 --> 11:24.834
GUYS,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:24.834 --> 11:26.467
TELL US. WE'RE
HERE TO SERVE.

11:26.467 --> 11:27.800
WE'RE YOUR NEW LACKEYS.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.300
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:29.300 --> 11:30.667
WE DO STUFF YOU WANT.

11:30.667 --> 11:33.467
WE'RE LIKE MAGIC GENIES
ON A SMALLER SCALE.

11:33.467 --> 11:37.200
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT,
GUYS, BUT NO THANKS.

11:38.367 --> 11:39.200
UHH!

11:39.200 --> 11:40.867

OF OUR AFFECTION.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.367
SEVENTH GRADER.
WE PUT HIM IN YOUR LOCKER.

11:42.367 --> 11:44.100
YOU CAN TORMENT HIM.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.100
JUST GO.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.567
GUYS, FIND
SOMEBODY ELSE.

11:48.567 --> 11:51.934
BUT YOU'RE EXACTLY WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR, RICCO.

11:51.934 --> 11:55.033
MY NAME'S NOT RICCO,
AND I DON'T NEED LACKEYS.

11:55.033 --> 11:56.834
I HATE YOU. YOU'RE SCUM.

11:56.834 --> 11:59.967
I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOU
SAY THAT AGAIN.

11:59.967 --> 12:01.500
YOU'RE SCUM.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.033
GOOD. NOW SMACK ME.

[MOANING]

12:11.734 --> 12:14.300
THAT IS SO UNFAIR,
MR. TURNER.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.300
YOU CAUGHT US
TOTALLY OFF GUARD.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.500
TOTALLY.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.734
IF YOU'RE NOT READY,

12:19.734 --> 12:21.000
WE'LL POSTPONE
TILL TOMORROW.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.500
NO, THOSE OF US
WHO HAVEN'T PREPARED

12:23.500 --> 12:25.467

12:36.367 --> 12:40.700
AFTER REVIEWING
THE DISCIPLINARY REPORT
FROM YOUR LAST SCHOOL,

12:40.700 --> 12:44.667
I WAS EXPECTING
A MUCH BRASHER YOUNG MAN.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.300
BUT I MUST SAY,

12:46.300 --> 12:48.100
YOU'VE BEEN QUIET, POLITE.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.734
IF THIS IS AN ATTEMPT

12:49.734 --> 12:52.967
TO LULL ME INTO
A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY,

FILLING IN.

13:11.734 --> 13:13.500

I'D MAKE IT.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.367
I'M NOT USUALLY
A MORNING PERSON,

13:15.367 --> 13:17.600

13:47.500 --> 13:50.567
I FIGURE I'D BE SITTING
IN THIS SEAT SO MUCH,

13:50.567 --> 13:53.934

TO TAKE IN THE VIEW
FROM YOUR SIDE.

WHAT DID YOU GET?

16:41.133 --> 16:42.300
A 96.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.734
LET'S JUMP
UP AND DOWN!

16:43.734 --> 16:46.200
I CAN'T.
WHY NOT?

16:46.200 --> 16:49.200
WE BOTH KNOW
I STUDIED FOR IT.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.500
SO DID I. THAT'S WHY WE
DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.000
YEAH, BUT I FEEL
LIKE A CHEATER.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.834

OH, OH, MY STOMACH.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.600
LOOK, THIS IS
THE WAY IT IS.

17:05.600 --> 17:08.200
WE BOTH STUDIED
AND WE GOT GOOD
GRADES.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.400
NOW, DEAL WITH IT!

TAKE THEM ON
A TRIAL BASIS?

17:27.900 --> 17:32.000
LOOK AT THESE
LITTLE FACES.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.567
IT'S TOUGH TO SAY
NO TO YOU GUYS,
BUT...NO.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.900

17:56.767 --> 17:59.100
I HEARD A LOT
ABOUT YOU.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.200
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
EVERYTHING YOU HEAR.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.200
WELL, I HEARD IT
FROM LORETTE,

18:03.200 --> 18:04.600

18:04.600 --> 18:06.734
WELL, HER YOU CAN BELIEVE.

18:06.734 --> 18:09.700

STEP OUTSIDE
AND TALK?

18:09.700 --> 18:11.600
ACTUALLY, WE'D LOVE
TO STEP OUTSIDE.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.300
WE JUST LOVE
TO TALK.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.800

ME AND HIM.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.567
NO...

18:23.567 --> 18:26.734
WE'RE BETWEEN
YOU AND HIM.

18:29.800 --> 18:30.967
O.K., THEN.

18:30.967 --> 18:33.834
JUST HAVE HER HOME
BY 10:00.

18:33.834 --> 18:35.300

THEY'RE VERY HANDY.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.200
IT WOULD TIME
TALKING MY WAY
OUT OF

18:41.200 --> 18:42.967

SITUATIONS.

18:42.967 --> 18:45.400

SCRATCHED OUR SURFACE.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.967

DO YOU DO?

18:46.967 --> 18:49.500

19:06.400 --> 19:08.867
MR. TURNER,
I GOT TO TELL YOU.

19:08.867 --> 19:11.100
WE KNEW ABOUT
THE QUIZ IN ADVANCE.

19:11.100 --> 19:15.100
WE SAW IT
AT YOUR HOUSE
IN YOUR LESSON PLAN.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.033
THE ONE I LEFT OPEN
ON MY DESK?
YEAH.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.567
THE ONE I EASILY
COULD HAVE COVERED,
BUT I DIDN'T?

19:20.567 --> 19:23.867
THAT'S THE ONE.
WHAT'S GOING ON,
MR. TURNER--

19:23.867 --> 19:26.834
IF THAT'S YOUR
REAL NAME.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.500
I WANT YOU TO GET
GOOD GRADES.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.500
BY LETTING US CHEAT?

19:31.500 --> 19:35.300

HAS BEEN THE HOMEWORK
THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.500
IT HAS?

19:37.500 --> 19:39.967
YOU MEAN,
YOU WANT US TO KNOW
WHAT TO STUDY?

19:39.967 --> 19:42.100
WELL, I'M LOST.

19:42.100 --> 19:43.600
THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.133
I STAND IN FRONT AND TALK.

19:45.133 --> 19:48.033
YOU LEARN.
IT'S CALLED EDUCATION.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.500
SO THAT'S WHY
THIS BUILDING
EXISTS.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.400
SOME OF US ARE
STUDENTS,

19:55.400 --> 19:57.734
AND SOME OF US
ARE TEACHERS.

19:57.734 --> 19:59.800
IF THE STUDENTS
LISTEN TO THE
TEACHERS,

19:59.800 --> 20:01.200
THEN--

20:01.200 --> 20:02.500
OH, I ALMOST
GOT IT!

20:04.300 --> 20:06.600
THEN THEY GET
GOOD GRADES.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.700
BUT WHY?

20:07.700 --> 20:09.500
WHY DO YOU THINK,
SHAWN?

20:09.500 --> 20:12.200
BECAUSE...
IF YOU GET
GOOD GRADES,

20:12.200 --> 20:14.233
IT MEANS YOU'VE
ACTUALLY LEARNED
SOMETHING.

20:14.233 --> 20:15.900
AM I CLOSE?

20:15.900 --> 20:18.100
PRETTY CLOSE.
WOULDN'T YOU SAY, GEORGE?

20:18.100 --> 20:20.600
I MUST SAY
I'M SURPRISED,
MR. TURNER.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.767
YOU KNOW, GUYS,

20:22.767 --> 20:24.200
YOU CAN GET "As"
AGAIN,

20:24.200 --> 20:26.300
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.100
WE CAN LOOK AT
YOUR LESSON PLAN?

20:28.100 --> 20:32.000
ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S ON THE BLACKBOARD
EVERY DAY.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.867
WHOA.
WHOA.

20:36.567 --> 20:39.500
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.
GO HOME AND OPEN A BOOK.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.300
YOU GOT IT.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.767
HOLD IT, MR. MATTHEWS,
MR. HUNTER.

20:43.767 --> 20:46.767
AM I TO UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'VE HEARD ALL THIS

20:46.767 --> 20:49.100
AND ARE NOW GOING HOME
TO OPEN A BOOK?

20:49.100 --> 20:50.867
YEAH. WE HEARD HIM
LOUD AND CLEAR.

20:50.867 --> 20:52.300
HE WAS TALKING
RIGHT TO US.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.967
I BELIEVE WE SAID $20.
YEAH. YEAH.

21:16.667 --> 21:18.000
WHOA! WHO WAS THAT?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.500
YOU LIKE HER?
YOU GOT HER.

21:19.500 --> 21:22.967
YOGI, BOO-BOO, BACK.
JUST WANT TO KNOW
HER NAME.

21:22.967 --> 21:25.000
YO, COOKIE,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.233
GUYS, IF YOU'RE
GOING TO HANG WITH ME,

21:27.233 --> 21:29.600
YOU GOT TO CHILL,
MELLOW OUT.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.367
SHAWN, LOOK,
THERE THEY ARE--

21:32.367 --> 21:36.000
THE THUGS FORMERLY
KNOWN AS THUGS.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
SHAWN, LOOK!

21:37.000 --> 21:38.233
A TRASH CAN!

21:38.233 --> 21:40.600
LET'S TAKE A LOOK INSIDE.

21:40.600 --> 21:44.233
ISN'T THAT DANGEROUS,
WITH FRANKIE AND JOEY WATCHING?

21:44.233 --> 21:48.900
I AM SCARED,
BUT I'M WILLING
TO TAKE A CHANCE.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.400
HEY, CAN WE?

21:50.400 --> 21:52.300
KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT.

21:53.934 --> 21:55.100
HELLO.
HELLO.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.500
Shawn, is it safe?

22:02.500 --> 22:04.500
No. I hear someone
coming.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.500
[CHEWING]

22:17.500 --> 22:19.667
HEY, WHERE'D YOU
GET THE GUM?
