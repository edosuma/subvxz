00:03.804 --> 00:11.011
[music playing]

00:15.416 --> 00:16.217
Wow.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.892
I believe they're here.

00:24.925 --> 00:26.494
Welcome to the
Golden Chamber Spa.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.395
I'm Carol.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.797
You must be Roseanne and Jackie?

00:29.830 --> 00:31.132
Yeah, you got
anything to drink?

00:31.165 --> 00:34.235
Yeah, the air conditioner
in our cab was busted.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.569
Oh, man, it was
so sticky, I about

00:35.603 --> 00:38.839
pulled the whole back
seat out with me.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.774
Uh huh.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.711
Why don't we check
you in, rinse off.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.046
And I'll meet you down
here for your evaluation.

00:46.080 --> 00:46.880
Yama, the bags.

00:49.650 --> 00:54.622
And can you put us
close to the soda machine?

00:54.655 --> 00:56.490
I'm sweating like a pig, man.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.166
I know that this
is a bit awkward.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.801
But I do have to
identify problem areas.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.474
Oh, Roseanne, what
is this back here?

01:13.507 --> 01:14.542
Oh, well.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.809
That's a dowager's hump.

01:15.843 --> 01:19.580
A lot of Eastern
European women have them.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.315
I don't have one.

01:21.349 --> 01:23.117
That's because I smashed
yours when you were little.

01:26.287 --> 01:30.358
You really are quite
hairy, aren't you?

01:30.391 --> 01:33.127
I think it's just, you know,
it's kind of thick and dark.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.728
So it looks like there's a lot.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.265
You should have a
bikini wax immediately.

01:37.298 --> 01:40.734
I shave my thighs regularly.

01:40.768 --> 01:41.569
I can see the stubble.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.910
Jackie, your hair is thin.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.779
Follicles are clogged.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.715
Root texture is rough.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.818
Very sorry.

01:57.851 --> 02:01.289
And Roseanne, I see lots
of gray and split ends

02:01.322 --> 02:03.991
and what is going on
with your eyebrows?

02:07.127 --> 02:09.330
I tried to light the
pilot light last week.

02:12.933 --> 02:17.605
Your skin is dirty, hm?

02:17.638 --> 02:18.806
Some scarring.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.642
I would recommend a
facial, every day.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.976
It's unusual.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.077
But so is your skin.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.383
Jackie, OK.

02:29.417 --> 02:33.120
Yeah, a lot of dead
skin on this face.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.022
And those eye bags.

02:35.055 --> 02:35.856
Uh, wow.

02:40.228 --> 02:43.764
OK, next skin is not form.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.267
It has very little elasticity.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.569
Yours is looser than most.

02:48.602 --> 02:52.273
I'm not really sure
what to recommend here.

02:52.306 --> 02:55.376
Well, maybe we should just
pack our bags and go home.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.745
We do have a
product from France.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.112
It is a thigh cream.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.648
But I think that your
neck would respond.

03:08.722 --> 03:12.560
Jackie, your breasts
are oddly shaped.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.763
And too small for your body.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.431
I am so sorry.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.003
And Roseanne.

03:23.036 --> 03:27.641
Oh, your derriere is badly in
need of a reshaping and a lift.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.846
I guess we're probably the
most disgusting people you've

03:32.880 --> 03:36.016
ever tried to help, right?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.150
We don't judge.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.086
We reveal and heal.

03:39.119 --> 03:41.121
That's what you do here.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.856
So, uh, Jackie, why
don't you hop on the bike

03:42.890 --> 03:44.925
and we'll test your endurance?

03:44.958 --> 03:48.296
And Roseanne, we'll
measure your body fat.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.196
All right.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.835
Oh.

03:54.868 --> 03:55.836
OK.

03:55.869 --> 03:56.904
Wow, OK, you're
bigger than you look.

04:04.912 --> 04:08.516
You are pleasantly fat.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.018
- Thank you.
- Carol.

04:11.051 --> 04:11.852
Roseanne.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.862
[music playing]

04:21.895 --> 04:26.367
(SINGING) You know what doesn't
kill us is making us stronger.

04:26.400 --> 04:30.838
We're gonna last longer than
the greatest wall of China

04:30.871 --> 04:34.808
or that rabbit with a drum.

04:34.842 --> 04:38.812
If there's one thing
that I've learned,

04:38.846 --> 04:42.783
while waiting for my
turn, is that in each life

04:42.816 --> 04:47.287
some rain falls, but
you also get some sun.

04:47.321 --> 04:50.257
And we'll make out
better than okay.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.258
Hey.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.761
Hear what I say?

04:53.794 --> 04:56.163
Yeah, any day.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.706
[laughter]

05:05.739 --> 05:15.783
[music playing]

05:15.783 --> 05:23.624

[non-english speech]

06:13.507 --> 06:15.976
[music playing]

06:16.009 --> 06:20.113
The seaweed wrap
must be air tight.

06:20.147 --> 06:26.420
Gaps spaces or openings
will not be tolerated.

06:26.454 --> 06:29.657
So this cleans out
all the toxins, huh?

06:29.690 --> 06:32.560
It is not a mere cleaning.

06:32.593 --> 06:38.499
The impurities are purged
by our relentless drive

06:38.532 --> 06:40.934
through the skin.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.971
I'm scared, Roseanne.

06:44.004 --> 06:47.775
[non-english speech]

06:47.808 --> 06:50.711
That's pretty tight.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.581
At least I can
still move my fingers.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.882
You are weak.
Pull!

06:58.819 --> 07:01.188
OK, now I can't breathe.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.089
Perfect.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.391
now you will feel itchy.

07:04.424 --> 07:11.264
It means that the toxins are
fleeing from the purification.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.667
After that, report
to the showers.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.210
Oh, I really wish
she hadn't said

07:23.243 --> 07:26.780
that thing about the itching.

07:26.814 --> 07:33.921
[music playing]

07:33.954 --> 07:41.361
Well, I haven't seen a worse
case since maybe Janet Reno.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.330
That's hitting below the belt.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.432
And Ms. Reno
refused the products

07:45.465 --> 07:47.400
that I recommended,
just like Tommy

07:47.434 --> 07:50.437
Lee Jones and James Woods.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.105
Well, I'll buy your products.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.208
Oh, yeah, we'll get
all your products.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.043
Oh, good.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.983
Your pores are engorged.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.384
Ew, with what?

08:04.417 --> 08:05.218
Debris.

08:08.088 --> 08:12.860
that's why your face looks
so rough and peasant like.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.061
You eat a lot of cheese.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.362
No dairy.

08:15.395 --> 08:18.766
[shushing]

08:18.799 --> 08:23.136
No dairy do you know the
pores define the face?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.305
They're little fountains that
squirt garbage out of the body.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.875
And sometimes that
fountain gets clogged.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.777
And that's what
enlarges your pores.

08:29.810 --> 08:33.280
Large pores make a face
look tired and cheap.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.314
What is that?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.549
It's an extractor.

08:35.583 --> 08:38.518
It gets rid of
blackheads, pimples, etc.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.020
Ow!

08:40.053 --> 08:41.021
What?

08:41.054 --> 08:43.991
Ow!

08:44.024 --> 08:48.662
I'm just going to have
to peel off this top face.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.163
I recommend an acid peel.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.999
Michael Jackson
just swears by it.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.702
Oh, he's got beautiful skin.

08:54.735 --> 08:59.707
[yelling]

08:59.740 --> 09:02.676
Calm.

09:02.710 --> 09:07.180
[music playing]

09:07.214 --> 09:11.151
[ripping noise]

09:11.184 --> 09:15.122
[screaming]

09:15.155 --> 09:19.660
[harmonica riff]

09:19.693 --> 09:22.696
It's like little people food.

09:22.730 --> 09:23.597
I can't believe it.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.465
I'm almost finished.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.334
Excuse me.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.502
Please, tell me that
this is not the dinner.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.404
Please, tell me that,
even if you have to lie.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.640
I'm afraid it is.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.976
Carol has you both on a very
strict 800 calorie diet.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.410
Well, you know what,
I would like to know

09:37.444 --> 09:39.146
what Carol is eating tonight.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.413
Tell me.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.149
Tell me!

09:42.182 --> 09:45.085
Ma'am, please,
there's still dessert.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.186
Oh, OK, good.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.059
Voila!

09:57.164 --> 10:00.701
I'm really not getting
this joke, junior.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.506
This is our last
meal for 12 hours.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.875
Like hell it is.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.677
I can get a pizza
here in 30 minutes.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.545
No, don't-- don't
you start that.

10:12.579 --> 10:16.449
I'm going to get two pepperoni
pizzas with an extra topping

10:16.483 --> 10:17.718
of two pepperoni pizzas.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.087
Roseanne.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.522
You'll never get that passed
the guard at the gate.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.624
Oh, yeah, I will, 'cause
you'll distract the guy.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.159
And I'll smack him with my hump.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.297
Roseanne!

10:30.330 --> 10:34.334
Listen, if you are not with
me, then you're against me.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.435
You can do it.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.071
People can go a
month without food.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.708
Yeah. 'cause they're idiots.

10:40.741 --> 10:41.608
I need food!

10:45.645 --> 10:48.615
I'm not gonna make it, Jackie.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.517
[harmonica riff]

10:51.618 --> 11:05.398
[music playing]

11:05.432 --> 11:06.299
Don't.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.467
Stop hanging on me.

11:11.872 --> 11:16.777
Oh, why don't you
just go on without me.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.346
Just leave me the gun, so
I can shoot the buzzards.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.213
Go on.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.448
Come on.

11:21.481 --> 11:24.918
You going to get in trouble
with the hike leader.

11:24.952 --> 11:25.886
Oh, my God, Jackie.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.054
What?

11:27.087 --> 11:29.056
There's a big, fat,
juicy squirrel over there.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.690
Get a rock!

11:30.724 --> 11:32.692
You are deranged
from lack of protein.

11:32.726 --> 11:33.526
Bean him!

11:36.329 --> 11:38.131
Hey.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.266
Hi.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.633
Would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?

11:40.667 --> 11:42.169
No, but can I eat your dinner?

11:45.472 --> 11:49.576
Let me know when you're
the last man on earth.

11:49.609 --> 11:50.844
Come on.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.413
Let's shuffle back to our
room and nap before lunch.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.515
Maybe we'll get lucky and
drop dead in our sleep.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.483
Now see here.
We're in trouble.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.486
Here comes the hike leader.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.921
Excuse me, ladies.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.790
No habla Ingles.

12:02.823 --> 12:06.093
Look, if you want to quit
the hike, I just need to know.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.427
It's really no problem.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.696
OK, well, yeah, we're
going to quit the hike.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.531
Yeah, I'm kind of amazed
you made it this far.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.904
What's that suppose to mean?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.406
Well, a woman of your
size really shouldn't put

12:19.439 --> 12:23.176
so much strain on her heart.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.413
Are you saying that I
can't finish that hike?

12:26.446 --> 12:29.783
I'm just saying that not
everyone was meant to be fit.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.718
Well, I'm fit.

12:31.751 --> 12:32.986
Yeah, right.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.922
And I'm the World Boxing
Council Lightweight champion.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.393
Well, I'll snap your spine
in half like a potato chip,

12:40.427 --> 12:41.228
you bitch.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.504
Jackie, here's another squirrel.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.707
And I am not letting
this one get away.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.676
Oh, my God.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.646
[harmonica riff]

12:59.679 --> 13:02.850
And reach forward to the
fingertips of your left hand.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.818
Now it brought the right
shoulder underneath your thigh,

13:04.852 --> 13:06.887
and reach your right
hand between your legs.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.289
Wrap your left arm around your
body with your right hand,

13:09.322 --> 13:10.690
grab onto your left wrist.

13:10.723 --> 13:11.724
Inhale.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.460
Lift the chest away
from the tailbone.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.361
Exhale.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.395
Press the arm straight.

13:15.428 --> 13:19.299
Open up your chest
towards the sky.

13:19.332 --> 13:22.870
This is not human.

13:22.903 --> 13:27.007
I thought yoga was about
reefer and Ravi Shankar.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.076
And now back on your buttocks.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.444
Press the left heel forward,
and with both hands,

13:31.478 --> 13:33.246
lift the foot over your head.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.088
Hi, Pete.

13:41.121 --> 13:45.192
I hate to disturb
you, but I have

13:45.225 --> 13:49.129
a couple of openings for
past life regression therapy.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.232
Anyone interested?

13:52.265 --> 13:54.801
I think at this point, I
would volunteer for lab testing.

13:56.937 --> 13:57.737
Get me up.

14:01.241 --> 14:06.113
[harmonica riff]

14:06.146 --> 14:10.383
Now it's not unusual
for a person to question

14:10.417 --> 14:12.785
the reality of past lives.

14:12.819 --> 14:19.159
So Yama is going to be
infusing me with is breath,

14:19.192 --> 14:20.693
so that I can better assist you.

14:22.795 --> 14:27.667
We're going to go inside.

14:33.773 --> 14:36.910
I'm going to go
inside, so that you

14:36.944 --> 14:41.248
can find out why you've
come back in this lifetime

14:41.281 --> 14:43.416
with these obstacles.

14:43.450 --> 14:46.353
You, with the eye bags.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.488
And you, unpleasantly fat.

14:52.725 --> 14:58.098
So let's begin by breathing in
the air through our eyeballs

14:58.131 --> 15:02.635
and bringing it down
into our diaphragm.

15:02.669 --> 15:07.240
Just follow Yama
and I and inhale.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.512
[yell]

15:12.545 --> 15:13.413
Exhale.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.915
I didn't hear a "thah."

15:15.949 --> 15:17.784
Inhale.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.652
[yell]

15:19.686 --> 15:21.154
Very nice.

15:21.188 --> 15:25.692
Now just continue that
gentle breathing in silence

15:25.725 --> 15:27.260
and close your eyes.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.495
[yell]

15:28.528 --> 15:32.732
And know that what we call,
life, we had experienced

15:32.765 --> 15:36.869
many times in the past.

15:36.903 --> 15:40.607
Imagine yourselves in nature.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.976
There's a bridge up ahead.

15:43.010 --> 15:47.480
On the other side
lies a lifetime

15:47.514 --> 15:50.750
you have not visited
in many years.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.085
[yell]

15:52.119 --> 15:54.654
Go ahead.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.057
Cross the bridge.

16:03.130 --> 16:03.997
Ah ha!

16:04.031 --> 16:04.998
There she is.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.899
Xena, the warrior princess.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.335
Get her!

16:08.368 --> 16:20.447

16:20.480 --> 16:22.649
I guess your mother never
told you not to hit girls.

16:25.685 --> 16:29.956
Xanthippi, I should have
known these men were with you.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.624
Forget them, Xena.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.494
I have come to give
you a real challenge.

16:34.527 --> 16:35.695
Fine.

16:35.728 --> 16:36.763

17:05.258 --> 17:08.595
Slay me now, and
end my suffering.

17:08.628 --> 17:14.000
Oh, I have something even
more terrible in mind for you.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.535
Haisong, Kim.

17:23.110 --> 17:28.081

17:28.115 --> 17:31.118
Slowly bring your
awareness back into the room.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.222
Oh man.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.956
That was so awesome.

17:36.989 --> 17:42.095
I was kicking ass and
my neck looked great.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.831
Jackie, who were you?

17:44.864 --> 17:46.166
I was a leper.

17:50.637 --> 17:51.738
Parts kept falling off.

17:58.211 --> 18:05.051
[music playing]

18:05.084 --> 18:07.620
Ladies, congratulations.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.557
Give yourselves a big hand for
all the hard work that you've

18:10.590 --> 18:13.560
accomplished this far.

18:13.593 --> 18:17.330
Now that you've achieved
these beautiful bodies

18:17.364 --> 18:19.666
it's a shame to cover them up.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.801
But it is the law.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.903
So it is with great
pleasure that I

18:23.936 --> 18:29.041
introduce to world renowned
fashion designer, Todd Oldham.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.518
I believe every good
designer filters has ideas

18:38.551 --> 18:39.752
for the era that we live in.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.155
And we're living in an
era of self-expression,

18:42.189 --> 18:43.623
where colors,
patterns, and textures

18:43.656 --> 18:45.492
all mingle perfectly together.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.894
What's fashionable is
what makes you feel good.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.429
So today, I want to
show you a few pieces

18:49.462 --> 18:52.064
from my fall 1996 collection.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.534
So do you make anything
over a size three?

18:54.567 --> 18:55.502
Oh, yes, we do.

18:55.535 --> 18:56.403
Oh, right.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.537
Yeah.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.940
Todd, maybe you could
give Roseanne some help.

19:00.973 --> 19:01.841
OK.

19:01.874 --> 19:09.015
[applause]

19:09.048 --> 19:10.116
My pleasure.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.186
Well, I think to
cantilever the top section,

19:13.220 --> 19:16.022
a really strong foundation
garment is in order.

19:16.055 --> 19:20.693
And the midsection, let's keep
it dark and go with long cuts

19:20.727 --> 19:23.363
just sort of
de-emphasize this area

19:23.396 --> 19:26.165
and bring your
attention elsewhere.

19:26.199 --> 19:29.502
And then to avoid that
cloven hooves problem,

19:29.536 --> 19:32.339
I think a closed shoe
would be in order.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.940
So don't wear
anything reflective.

19:33.973 --> 19:34.841
Keep it simple.

19:34.874 --> 19:35.742
Nothing shiny.

19:35.775 --> 19:36.643
No furs.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.278
It will add too much bulk.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.779
No belts.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.414
Just go with what
you want to do.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.082
What you feel good about.

19:43.115 --> 19:46.353
And you have such pretty
skin, such a pretty face.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.687
Oh, thank you, Todd.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.659
Oh, my goodness!

19:52.692 --> 19:55.595
[harmonica riff]

19:55.628 --> 19:58.130
Now girls, is there
anything special that you'd

19:58.164 --> 20:01.000
like in your makeup today?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.168
No, you're the artist.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.203
Yeah, just go
with your instinct.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.137
Good.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.606
because from my
experience, I have

20:06.639 --> 20:08.675
found out that natural is best.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.077
You know, let your face
tell its own story.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.279
Would that be OK?

20:12.312 --> 20:15.114
All right.
