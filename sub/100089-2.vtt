WEBVTT

00:03.445 --> 00:06.421
Happy first day of school breakfast!

00:06.466 --> 00:09.891
This year's theme... Second. Guess why?

00:09.930 --> 00:12.648
Because the theme is always just
whatever grade I'm starting?

00:12.688 --> 00:14.557
Not true. Pre-school was "Bunnies."

00:14.604 --> 00:15.725
Now, sit.

00:15.758 --> 00:17.860
This year,

00:17.894 --> 00:20.731
we're having Stackie Robinsons

00:20.763 --> 00:24.300
in honor of Hall of Fame
second baseman Jackie Robinson.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.774
I had a protein shake before my run.

00:26.806 --> 00:28.118
I've been up since 5:00.

00:28.143 --> 00:29.173
You went for a run?

00:29.205 --> 00:31.508
- Alone? In the dark?
- Relax.

00:31.541 --> 00:32.976
I was on the treadmill.

00:33.008 --> 00:35.244
Blacktop is murder on my knees.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.336
Yikes. Better hit the road.

00:37.402 --> 00:40.371
Hit the road to school, right?

00:40.405 --> 00:42.073
Yeah. Where else would I be going?

00:42.106 --> 00:44.643
Um, your high-powered job
in advertising?

00:45.777 --> 00:48.045
You haven't changed a bit.

00:48.079 --> 00:50.149
Yeah. Neither have you.

00:51.182 --> 00:52.651
We stopped for coffee.

00:52.683 --> 00:54.819
Sophie got a punch card.
Her next coffee's free.

00:54.853 --> 00:56.954
Then we listened to NPR
the whole ride here.

00:56.987 --> 00:58.006
It's like she went away

00:58.031 --> 00:59.423
to Lance Bass Space Camp a little girl

00:59.457 --> 01:00.893
and came back a middle-aged commuter.

01:00.926 --> 01:02.094
She reminds me of my mom.

01:02.127 --> 01:04.163
Did Graham change
at Lance Bass Space Camp?

01:04.196 --> 01:05.898
Ask him yourself.

01:05.931 --> 01:08.267
I'm a new man, W.C.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.358
Check it.

01:09.383 --> 01:11.883
- Ankle socks.
- See?

01:11.908 --> 01:13.472
Sophie wants to be an emancipated minor

01:13.505 --> 01:15.240
and Graham's got a sock thing.

01:15.273 --> 01:16.475
Change is everywhere.

01:16.508 --> 01:17.921
So true.

01:17.946 --> 01:19.645
I don't know how I'm gonna handle

01:19.678 --> 01:21.079
Jack starting pre-school.

01:22.479 --> 01:24.515
Okay. Mwah. Okay.

01:24.548 --> 01:26.651
Enjoy your first day, buddy.

01:26.684 --> 01:28.353
Make me proud.

01:28.386 --> 01:30.655
You know this school starts

01:30.688 --> 01:32.023
at kindergarten, right?

01:34.191 --> 01:35.986
Huh.

01:36.056 --> 01:38.165
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

01:41.199 --> 01:42.601
This is Ben.

01:42.634 --> 01:46.337
He got mono and was bedridden
most of August.

01:46.778 --> 01:48.247
Big Benny!

01:48.287 --> 01:50.852
Look at the tan on you!

01:50.877 --> 01:52.178
Ow. Geez.

01:52.211 --> 01:54.514
Someone's been working out.

01:54.547 --> 01:57.003
- Hand sanitizer.
- Of course.

01:57.028 --> 01:58.618
Rory Banks, class president.

01:58.651 --> 02:00.854
Please tell Will that change is good.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.189
Uh, okay.

02:02.222 --> 02:03.391
Is this based on

02:03.424 --> 02:04.791
something you were
talking about earlier, or...

02:04.824 --> 02:06.026
You know what? I don't care.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.161
- Will, change can be good.
- Oh, please.

02:08.195 --> 02:10.163
Name one good change
that's ever happened,

02:10.197 --> 02:11.866
and you can't say
cucumbers into pickles.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.669
Moms, dads, and non-binary life-givers,

02:15.702 --> 02:18.205
I am Generation Z's Homily Pronstroller.

02:18.238 --> 02:20.207
I recently sold my horse-share app

02:20.239 --> 02:22.242
for enough money to take a gap year

02:22.275 --> 02:24.744
teaching second grade
before I run for Congress.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.346
Will last year's Room Parent

02:26.380 --> 02:29.517
please raise their hand
or a limb of their choosing?

02:29.549 --> 02:32.153
Hi, everyone.

02:32.185 --> 02:35.055
Listen, I know that
change can be scary, okay?

02:35.089 --> 02:36.891
But in this topsy-turvy world,

02:36.923 --> 02:38.358
one constant remains.

02:38.392 --> 02:42.496
I am and forever shall remain
your Room Parent.

02:42.529 --> 02:43.898
Gotcha!

02:43.930 --> 02:46.232
I asked you to identify yourself

02:46.266 --> 02:49.169
so as to eliminate you from contention.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.604
Here.

02:50.637 --> 02:54.175
It's all in the Hilltop Charter.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.508
Does it say why they named it Hilltop?

02:55.542 --> 02:57.044
'Cause it's flat as hell around here.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.213
A new law has been passed.

02:59.245 --> 03:02.048
The Every-Other-Year Room Parent Act?

03:02.082 --> 03:05.052
"No parent of any child
shall be Room Parent

03:05.084 --> 03:07.620
for a term of two consecutive years"?

03:07.654 --> 03:09.423
So, because I was Room Parent
in first grade,

03:09.455 --> 03:11.925
I can't be Room Parent in second grade?

03:11.959 --> 03:14.395
So, the soonest
I can be Room Parent again

03:14.428 --> 03:15.796
is third grade?

03:15.828 --> 03:18.198
So, for the next 365 days,

03:18.232 --> 03:20.967
I have to drift
through life purposeless,

03:21.000 --> 03:22.769
my identity stripped away

03:22.803 --> 03:24.172
like so much old wallpaper?

03:25.138 --> 03:26.439
Mm-hmm.

03:26.472 --> 03:28.242
Now, who is familiar with

03:28.274 --> 03:30.443
how a "not it" vote works?

03:30.477 --> 03:32.713
It's pretty complicated,
so pay close attention...

03:32.745 --> 03:33.780
- Not it!
- Not it!

03:33.814 --> 03:34.914
It! It! It!

03:34.939 --> 03:38.719
Presenting your 2019-2020
Hilltop Elementary School

03:38.751 --> 03:40.954
- Second Grade Room Parent!
- No, no, no! No!

03:40.988 --> 03:42.056
Not it!

03:42.089 --> 03:43.990
Not it! I was in the bathroom!

03:44.024 --> 03:45.626
I said "not it" in the bathroom,

03:45.659 --> 03:47.293
but you just didn't hear!

03:47.327 --> 03:48.329
Not it! Not it!

03:48.362 --> 03:49.797
Oh, no.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.264
Did something terrible happen
in politics?

03:51.298 --> 03:52.800
Kidding.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.568
You're waiting to see
if Derek has written back.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.237
And he has not.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.972
I pour my heart out
in an e-mail to Graham's dad

03:59.006 --> 04:01.574
that it took an entire summer
to break, outline, draft,

04:01.608 --> 04:03.911
edit, polish, punch-up,
spell-check, and finally send,

04:03.943 --> 04:04.978
and what do I hear back?

04:05.012 --> 04:06.113
Nothing.

04:06.145 --> 04:07.280
And if he'd written you back,

04:07.314 --> 04:08.516
that would have made you happy, or...?

04:08.548 --> 04:09.663
Of course not.

04:09.695 --> 04:11.258
Where does he get off writing me back?

04:11.285 --> 04:13.186
No one refuses to even
entertain the idea

04:13.220 --> 04:15.022
of a positive outcome like you.

04:15.054 --> 04:16.189
Thanks.

04:16.221 --> 04:17.992
I feel seen.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.161
- Can I tell you guys something?
- Mm.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.196
Pre-school costs money,
and money is the one...

04:22.229 --> 04:23.830
actually, one of the fi...

04:23.864 --> 04:26.333
eh, let's just say one of
the 20 things I don't have.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.202
Well, Miggy, you've been working here

04:28.234 --> 04:30.871
for almost a year
with scattered success.

04:30.903 --> 04:33.106
So, I guess we can talk about a raise.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.943
I would love to say
excitement caused that,

04:36.977 --> 04:37.879
- but it just slipped.
- Mm.

04:39.179 --> 04:42.650
You know, I can get Miggy a temp job,

04:42.682 --> 04:43.983
but it would mean fewer shifts here.

04:44.016 --> 04:45.351
Would you be okay with that?

04:45.384 --> 04:46.786
Would I be okay with

04:46.819 --> 04:50.156
not losing 50 glasses a week
to Slippy Longdroppings?

04:50.189 --> 04:52.326
With not having to sweep up
a nightly trail of blood

04:52.359 --> 04:53.827
and broken stemware?

04:53.859 --> 04:55.395
With getting out of a situation

04:55.429 --> 04:56.731
that's costing me money?

04:58.097 --> 04:59.400
The answer's yes, girl.

04:59.432 --> 05:00.567
Yeah, those are rhetorical questions.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.035
- Oh. Ohhh.
- Yeah.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.714
- Hey, Miggy?
- Hmm?

05:03.739 --> 05:05.705
You know, if you're truly
desperate for money,

05:05.739 --> 05:07.534
I can get you a job.

05:07.613 --> 05:11.156
A job in the grimmest, grossest,

05:11.188 --> 05:13.157
most awful place in the world.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.078
So, this is where I work.

05:15.109 --> 05:16.960
Now, you're gonna go through
each deposition,

05:16.993 --> 05:18.529
and every time you see the word

05:18.563 --> 05:21.132
"propane," "rectum,"

05:21.164 --> 05:23.333
or "shards," highlight it.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.369
Propane, rectum, shards.

05:25.402 --> 05:27.272
Got it. Then what do I do?

05:27.305 --> 05:29.474
You do it again.

05:29.507 --> 05:30.875
And again.

05:30.907 --> 05:32.142
Until the Earth collides with the sun

05:32.176 --> 05:33.678
and our souls are finally free.

05:34.411 --> 05:35.714
Cool.

05:43.020 --> 05:45.390
Rectum.

05:45.423 --> 05:47.158
Rectum.

05:47.190 --> 05:48.560
Oh, sh...

05:48.592 --> 05:49.693
Not shards.

05:49.726 --> 05:51.563
Nice try,<i> sharks.</i>

05:51.596 --> 05:52.830
What a lawsuit.

05:53.830 --> 05:55.332
Rectum.

05:55.366 --> 05:57.068
Rectum.

05:57.101 --> 05:59.204
Propaaane!

06:00.070 --> 06:02.911
There has to be a way
to regain our rightful roles

06:02.936 --> 06:05.239
as Not Room Parent and Room Parent.

06:05.264 --> 06:07.903
I mean, the twins... they want
their space, and so do I.

06:07.928 --> 06:10.072
That's why I don't
volunteer at their school

06:10.097 --> 06:13.189
and they don't work as doctors
in my dermatology group.

06:13.284 --> 06:15.986
Sophie's trying to pull away,
so obviously,

06:16.013 --> 06:18.823
I need to be around her more,
not less, right?

06:20.191 --> 06:22.760
We need to create a situation
where you are so negligent,

06:22.793 --> 06:24.416
Ms. Pronstroller has to remove you.

06:24.448 --> 06:26.216
And you act so heroically

06:26.250 --> 06:29.020
that Ms. Pronstroller
has to reinstate you.

06:29.053 --> 06:30.922
Where no children
are in actual danger...

06:30.955 --> 06:33.058
But it sure as hell looks like they are.

06:33.090 --> 06:36.393
Hmm, negligence, heroism,
perceived danger.

06:36.426 --> 06:38.729
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

06:38.763 --> 06:40.065
Never.

06:40.097 --> 06:42.699
Next Friday's field trip
to the Natural History Museum.

06:42.732 --> 06:44.668
The Room Parent has to chaperone.

06:44.702 --> 06:46.671
I can be there as a private citizen,

06:46.703 --> 06:48.606
and what's less dangerous than history?

06:51.909 --> 06:54.611
Gonna have to ride
on a school bus, won't I?

06:56.150 --> 06:57.447
Lucky.

06:59.143 --> 07:02.345
We are a buddy collective,
not a buddy system.

07:02.379 --> 07:05.482
So, we're only as strong
as our weakest buddy.

07:05.516 --> 07:07.641
Do not be that buddy.

07:07.666 --> 07:10.395
Will? What... I'm o...

07:10.420 --> 07:12.189
- Douglas! What are you...
- What are you doing here?

07:12.223 --> 07:13.990
I'm just enjoying the museum

07:14.023 --> 07:15.481
- and nothing else!
- I'm chaperoning a field trip!

07:15.506 --> 07:17.528
- Is that today?
- I know.

07:17.561 --> 07:19.230
- I've completely forgotten!
- I-I've heard of coincidences,

07:19.263 --> 07:21.165
- but this is ridiculous!
- This is... takes the cake.

07:22.232 --> 07:24.550
- Okay, let's go over the plan.
- Yeah.

07:24.581 --> 07:27.158
You get a kid to commit
the most heinous act imaginable

07:27.183 --> 07:29.432
at a museum... touching a bone.

07:29.457 --> 07:33.161
Not a load-bearing bone,
but still a bone.

07:33.195 --> 07:35.264
And before the kid
touches the bone, you say...

07:35.296 --> 07:37.832
"Someone stop that kid.

07:37.865 --> 07:39.000
It's my job,

07:39.033 --> 07:41.670
but I'm too drunk to Room Parent today."

07:41.704 --> 07:44.273
Then you will swoop in
from the gift shop,

07:44.305 --> 07:46.841
you will stop the kid pre-bone touch

07:46.875 --> 07:48.344
and save the day.

07:53.315 --> 07:55.951
We heard your plan
to get out of being Room Parent.

07:55.983 --> 07:56.985
It has holes.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.086
We're not mad.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.155
We understand.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.791
You being here
is as uncomfortable for us

08:01.824 --> 08:02.992
as it is for you.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.092
We can help with the plan.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.627
We're born accomplices.

08:05.661 --> 08:08.531
Or we can make sure
the plan goes horrible wrong.

08:08.563 --> 08:10.999
We're also born saboteurs.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.169
- Your move, Dad.
- All right.

08:13.202 --> 08:14.969
Well, look, I'm way too desperate

08:15.002 --> 08:17.339
and, frankly, too proud of both of you

08:17.372 --> 08:18.606
to be angry.

08:18.639 --> 08:20.509
- Way to turn the screws.
- Okay.

08:20.541 --> 08:21.976
Amy and I will find a patsy

08:22.009 --> 08:24.045
to touch a non-load-bearing bone.

08:24.079 --> 08:25.948
You sit tight and practice your line.

08:25.981 --> 08:27.350
Let's hear it.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.985
"Someone stop that kid."

08:30.018 --> 08:31.354
Little flat.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.722
I don't believe <i> you</i> believe it.

08:33.755 --> 08:35.789
These things <i> suck.</i>

08:35.823 --> 08:37.458
We cover a topic
that should take 10 minutes,

08:37.491 --> 08:39.994
except people participate for no reason

08:40.028 --> 08:41.464
and we're trapped here for days.

08:41.496 --> 08:43.501
Participation? Gross.

08:43.563 --> 08:44.978
I'm so glad you're here.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.168
Who can name a piece of technology

08:47.202 --> 08:48.703
they use in their job?

08:48.736 --> 08:49.904
Don't answer, people.

08:49.937 --> 08:51.539
Let her say it. Keep things moving.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.341
- Computers?
- Printers?

08:53.375 --> 08:57.046
Nice. Such good examples
of technology, you guys.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.981
But no one's guessed
the piece of technology

08:59.014 --> 09:00.683
we're here to talk about today.

09:00.716 --> 09:02.685
- Are you curious what it is?
- No.

09:04.468 --> 09:06.154
Now, who can give me an example

09:06.187 --> 09:08.090
of something we do on our phones?

09:08.123 --> 09:10.893
- We talk.
- We sure do, don't we?

09:10.926 --> 09:13.062
What else?

09:13.095 --> 09:14.930
Please take my belt and shoelaces.

09:14.962 --> 09:16.332
I'm afraid of what I might do.

09:16.365 --> 09:17.493
We listen!

09:17.518 --> 09:19.567
That's right. We listen.

09:19.601 --> 09:20.836
Miggy.

09:20.869 --> 09:22.071
Huh?

09:22.104 --> 09:23.572
Swear to me that you just said that

09:23.605 --> 09:24.707
to keep things moving.

09:24.740 --> 09:27.276
- Swear to me you're not enjoying this.
- I-I'm not.

09:27.308 --> 09:29.211
I hate it just like you.
I mean, listen to her.

09:29.244 --> 09:31.346
Every effective work-related voicemail

09:31.380 --> 09:32.881
begins with three things...

09:32.914 --> 09:36.851
your full name, your extension,
and a brief ice-breaker

09:36.884 --> 09:38.888
about a relatable topic
like the weather.

09:38.921 --> 09:41.190
What kind of dumb-dumb
leaves a voicemail like that?

09:46.995 --> 09:48.320
I don't know why

09:48.345 --> 09:50.865
that exhibit was recommended
for 16 and up.

09:50.899 --> 09:52.768
I mean, I learned a lot.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.136
What are you doing here?

09:54.168 --> 09:55.937
You're not the Room Parent.

09:55.971 --> 09:58.139
I am here as a private citizen.

09:58.173 --> 10:00.576
The fact that we're here
on the same day...

10:00.609 --> 10:01.811
total coincidence.

10:03.912 --> 10:05.281
Is that a new sweatshirt?

10:06.748 --> 10:08.617
What happened to the sweatshirt
you left the house in?

10:08.649 --> 10:11.553
It's not really me anymore,
so I donated it.

10:11.586 --> 10:12.955
For tax purposes.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.136
Who's the patsy?

10:22.659 --> 10:24.559
Someone stop that kid!

10:24.600 --> 10:25.901
It's my job,

10:25.933 --> 10:28.102
but I'm too drunk to Room Parent today!

10:33.942 --> 10:35.911
But I left an encouraging note
in that sweatshirt.

10:35.943 --> 10:38.746
Was it different than
the encouraging note in my shoe?

10:38.779 --> 10:40.182
They were similar, but of a piece.

10:46.221 --> 10:49.091
I said, "Someone stop that kid!

10:49.124 --> 10:50.158
It's my job,

10:50.192 --> 10:52.794
but I'm too drunk to Room Parent today!"

10:52.827 --> 10:54.630
Hey, what has gotten into you?

10:54.663 --> 10:56.832
You've been so different ever since
you got back from space camp.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.133
Why is...

10:58.165 --> 10:59.501
Graham so close to that dinosaur?

10:59.534 --> 11:00.836
Great question.

11:02.004 --> 11:04.306
Wait, what's "load-bearing"?

11:04.338 --> 11:05.540
Oh, well.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:17.919 --> 11:20.322
Go! Go, go, go! Get out of here!

11:20.355 --> 11:21.289
Kids, run!

11:23.692 --> 11:25.727
Ange, you know why I'm here.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.995
No.

11:27.029 --> 11:28.364
But I'm not questioning it,

11:28.397 --> 11:29.832
like when one roll of toilet paper

11:29.865 --> 11:31.366
says it equals
four rolls of toilet paper.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.568
Like, what am I gonna do?
Unroll it and measure?

11:33.601 --> 11:35.837
Thank you for giving me
the same benefit of the doubt

11:35.870 --> 11:36.971
that you give toilet paper.

11:37.005 --> 11:40.282
But no. I'm here because
I got a voicemail from Miggy.

11:40.307 --> 11:41.744
He's quitting the Winebrary

11:41.777 --> 11:42.993
because he loves working here.

11:43.018 --> 11:44.746
Boing, boing, ding, dong, dooey.

11:44.779 --> 11:46.247
See? I can talk nonsense, too.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.549
Miggy's a creative spirit.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.985
I mean, he needs the flexibility
of the Winebrary

11:50.018 --> 11:51.353
while he follows his dreams,

11:51.385 --> 11:53.988
be it Beach Sneaks or Swimming Jeans

11:54.022 --> 11:56.859
or Scareskunk...
the scarecrow for skunks.

11:56.891 --> 11:58.159
Relax, okay?

11:58.192 --> 12:00.562
I-I promise, Miggy hates it here.

12:00.596 --> 12:02.565
No. Listen to this voicemail.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.699
<i>Hello, this is Miggy LeFassbender Park.</i>

12:04.732 --> 12:06.601
<i>Extension 6921.</i>

12:06.634 --> 12:09.200
<i>Can you believe this humidity? Whew!</i>

12:10.264 --> 12:12.541
His full name, extension number,

12:12.566 --> 12:14.053
and a brief ice-breaker

12:14.078 --> 12:15.944
about a relatable topic
like the weather.

12:15.977 --> 12:17.779
Yeah? W-What does that mean?

12:17.812 --> 12:20.415
It means follow me
and pray we're not too late.

12:21.627 --> 12:23.619
Well, I've got bad news for VH1,

12:23.652 --> 12:26.021
'cause there's a new "Best Week Ever."

12:26.053 --> 12:28.524
And it's the one I just had here!

12:28.557 --> 12:30.526
Hey! Hey! Oh!

12:30.558 --> 12:31.559
Give me some!

12:31.592 --> 12:33.461
Give me some!

12:37.573 --> 12:38.974
Hey, it happens.

12:38.999 --> 12:41.536
I fought the bones, and the bones won.

12:41.836 --> 12:44.372
Well, I just spoke
to Principal Biscuits,

12:44.405 --> 12:47.642
and he said that despite
what transpired today,

12:47.676 --> 12:49.578
future accounts...

12:49.610 --> 12:52.380
shall remember Douglas as a hero.

12:53.782 --> 12:55.150
Because people drink,

12:55.183 --> 12:57.385
kids touch things, skeletons fall.

12:57.418 --> 12:59.554
But Douglas kept his cool,

12:59.587 --> 13:02.323
and that... that's what
a real Room Parent does.

13:02.356 --> 13:03.491
No!

13:03.524 --> 13:05.293
What a real Room Parent does

13:05.327 --> 13:07.129
is takes their case straight to the top!

13:07.162 --> 13:09.298
Okay, easy.
These kids are still skittish.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.166
You have to know that your excited voice

13:11.198 --> 13:13.234
sounds exactly like
giant clattering bones.

13:13.268 --> 13:15.638
Straight to the top.

13:15.671 --> 13:19.074
I'm being briefed by the Joint
Line-Leaders in five minutes.

13:19.106 --> 13:21.476
You have four. Make them count.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.944
All right, look, Rory, here's the deal...

13:22.977 --> 13:24.779
We need a favor, okay?

13:24.812 --> 13:27.208
Amend Hilltop's charter so that...

13:27.262 --> 13:28.370
I've already done a favor.

13:28.395 --> 13:29.851
Over the summer,

13:29.884 --> 13:31.953
I received a postcard from
a constituent asking me to pass

13:31.986 --> 13:34.589
the Every-Other-Year Room Parent Act.

13:34.623 --> 13:36.959
So, I did. That was the favor.

13:37.958 --> 13:39.494
Who was the constituent?

13:39.528 --> 13:40.962
I've been sworn to secrecy.

13:40.995 --> 13:44.298
But this is too Shakespearean
to pass up.

13:44.963 --> 13:46.265
Sophie.

13:46.290 --> 13:47.936
Nairobi.

13:47.968 --> 13:50.138
Cooper.

13:50.172 --> 13:53.267
That was a really insensitive
way of delivering that news.

13:54.723 --> 13:56.451
W-Why do you care
if I quit the Winebrary?

13:56.488 --> 13:57.894
Remember all the stuff
you caught me doing

13:57.919 --> 13:59.326
when we were on "Undercover Boss"?

13:59.366 --> 14:01.896
Okay, again, we were never
on "Undercover Boss."

14:01.943 --> 14:03.192
I just wore a hat that day.

14:03.217 --> 14:06.252
Poppy, the Winebrary gave me
time to follow my dreams,

14:06.285 --> 14:07.787
but I've found something better...

14:07.820 --> 14:10.089
the joy of mindless busy work.

14:10.122 --> 14:11.658
When I was developing Scareskunk,

14:11.692 --> 14:13.294
there was always more I could be doing.

14:13.327 --> 14:14.862
But now, I leave work at 5:00

14:14.895 --> 14:17.164
and don't think about it
until 9:00 the next day.

14:17.197 --> 14:19.229
And I can be 100% present with Jack.

14:19.254 --> 14:21.207
You leave Jack out of this.
What about the small talk?

14:21.232 --> 14:22.636
- Yeah!
- I love it.

14:22.669 --> 14:25.305
The small talk is
the busy work of conversation.

14:25.338 --> 14:26.472
Look, Miggy, this isn't just about

14:26.506 --> 14:28.641
you following your dreams.

14:28.674 --> 14:30.310
I miss you.

14:30.343 --> 14:32.278
You were always there
when I needed to talk.

14:32.312 --> 14:33.647
I'll still be there.

14:33.679 --> 14:35.382
I do live upstairs from you.

14:36.415 --> 14:38.986
True.

14:39.019 --> 14:40.721
Okay.

14:40.754 --> 14:42.356
Then you're fired.

14:42.389 --> 14:44.710
Thank you. I'll never forget this.

14:44.735 --> 14:47.538
Must be nice to wrap
everything up in a bow,

14:47.563 --> 14:49.129
but can we get back to my thing now?

14:49.161 --> 14:51.064
Miggy, if you love it here so much,

14:51.097 --> 14:52.466
why did you pretend to hate it?

14:52.498 --> 14:55.301
Because you hated it here.
I'm an empath, girl.

14:55.334 --> 14:57.170
And Poppy told me it's just easier.

14:58.671 --> 15:01.007
Yes, okay.

15:01.040 --> 15:04.011
Sometimes I pretend
to hate the things that you hate

15:04.044 --> 15:05.511
because it's the cost of doing business,

15:05.544 --> 15:07.982
the business here
being staying friends with you.

15:08.015 --> 15:09.984
O-O-Okay.

15:10.016 --> 15:12.573
There's only one way
to save this friendship,

15:12.598 --> 15:14.722
and it's as follows.

15:14.755 --> 15:17.065
Eh... Quittin' time.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.491
Let's pick this up first thing Monday.

15:18.525 --> 15:19.860
All right. Bye-bye.

15:19.892 --> 15:23.096
So, it might not have
totally been a coincidence,

15:23.130 --> 15:25.499
me being at the museum today.

15:25.531 --> 15:26.432
I'm sorry.

15:26.466 --> 15:27.835
Don't be.

15:27.867 --> 15:29.703
It was good
we had an extra pair of hands

15:29.736 --> 15:31.271
to drag Ms. Pronstroller out

15:31.304 --> 15:33.573
from underneath
the Tyrannosaurus pelvis.

15:33.607 --> 15:36.709
True, but I need
to stop fighting the fact

15:36.742 --> 15:38.044
that you're growing up

15:38.078 --> 15:40.414
and give you
the lowercase space you deserve,

15:40.447 --> 15:43.183
because I know Lance Bass
uppercase Space Camp

15:43.216 --> 15:45.519
made you realize that
having me around all the time

15:45.552 --> 15:46.954
might not be so great.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.054
No.

15:48.088 --> 15:51.091
Lance Bass... uppercase Space Camp

15:51.123 --> 15:54.560
made me realize that you
being around all the time is...

15:54.593 --> 15:56.129
too great.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.432
<i>20 seconds to impact.</i>

15:58.464 --> 16:00.867
<i>Still waiting on
your orders, Captain Cooper.</i>

16:00.900 --> 16:04.037
Do I deactivate
the atmospheric shield or not?

16:04.070 --> 16:06.306
If you deactivate the shield,

16:06.339 --> 16:08.274
every last molecule of oxygen escapes

16:08.308 --> 16:11.712
and the terra-forming colony will die!

16:11.745 --> 16:14.914
If I don't deactivate it,
you'll incinerate on impact,

16:14.948 --> 16:17.251
sacrificing yourself, your crew,

16:17.284 --> 16:19.953
and your priceless cargo
of frozen seeds.

16:19.987 --> 16:22.423
We gave those terra-formers our word!

16:22.456 --> 16:24.291
They knew what they were signing up for!

16:24.323 --> 16:27.560
If I just had more time!

16:27.593 --> 16:29.496
<i>10 seconds to impact.</i>

16:29.529 --> 16:30.898
There is no more time.

16:30.930 --> 16:32.432
This is <i> your</i> mission.

16:32.466 --> 16:33.667
What do you want to do?

16:35.791 --> 16:38.346
_

16:41.267 --> 16:43.978
_

16:49.116 --> 16:52.285
<i>What do you want to do?</i>

16:53.953 --> 16:56.122
I want to call my dad!

16:58.658 --> 17:00.127
<i>Impact achieved.</i>

17:01.327 --> 17:04.464
<i>Simulated fatality rate... 100%.</i>

17:04.497 --> 17:07.133
<i>Simulated victims are as follows...</i>

17:07.166 --> 17:09.502
<i>First Officer Adrita Anderson,</i>

17:09.535 --> 17:12.672
<i>Age 9, Westlake Village, California;</i>

17:12.705 --> 17:16.776
<i>Chaplain Father Albert Andrews,
Age 10, Butte, Montana;</i>

17:16.810 --> 17:19.646
<i>Embedded Journalist Amy Andrews,</i>

17:19.679 --> 17:22.180
<i>Age 8, Hilton Head, South Carolina...</i>

17:22.211 --> 17:23.703
Why couldn't it have been me?

17:23.781 --> 17:25.217
Why?

17:25.242 --> 17:27.787
Those people had families, damn it!

17:32.592 --> 17:33.826
Hey, Soph,

17:33.860 --> 17:35.228
<i>unstrap yourself and get down here.</i>

17:35.262 --> 17:37.331
We're gonna be late
for "Cabaret" tryouts.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.403
I should have been there.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.006
I could have been there,
by your side, like always.

17:46.038 --> 17:47.573
No, you couldn't have.

17:47.606 --> 17:50.243
It's a child-sized simulator.

17:50.276 --> 17:52.979
And you shouldn't have.

17:53.013 --> 17:54.747
You not being there for once

17:54.781 --> 17:57.251
made me realize
what an amazing dad you are,

17:57.284 --> 17:59.152
and it made me realize

17:59.186 --> 18:00.987
that I can do more on my own.

18:01.021 --> 18:03.357
I liked your first realization better.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.893
I decided then and there,

18:06.927 --> 18:10.664
as those 981 names scrolled by,

18:10.697 --> 18:12.065
that I wasn't gonna let another

18:12.099 --> 18:15.702
single simulated child astronaut
die on my watch,

18:15.735 --> 18:18.539
and that, as much as I loved you

18:18.572 --> 18:21.275
and as much as I missed you,

18:21.307 --> 18:24.944
I was gonna prove to myself
that I didn't <i> need</i> you.

18:24.977 --> 18:27.448
So, for the next 12 weeks...

18:27.480 --> 18:29.182
12 weeks?

18:29.216 --> 18:31.919
There are 12 weeks after
the activity you just described?

18:31.951 --> 18:33.920
That wasn't, like, a final project?

18:33.954 --> 18:37.291
That was orientation.
Lance is all business.

18:37.323 --> 18:39.426
But thanks to his controversial methods,

18:39.458 --> 18:41.762
by the time the summer was almost over,

18:41.794 --> 18:43.796
I had never felt more independent.

18:43.830 --> 18:46.699
And you knew that
once you were back at school,

18:46.733 --> 18:50.737
I'd be there
Room-Parent-ing my butt off.

18:50.769 --> 18:52.472
Message received.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.640
This year, my butt stays on.

18:54.673 --> 18:56.910
Deal?

18:58.577 --> 19:01.781
Now, I want you to tell me all
about this independent summer,

19:01.814 --> 19:03.950
you Outward Bound pamphlet come to life.

19:03.984 --> 19:05.486
I can take it.

19:05.518 --> 19:06.553
You sure?

19:06.585 --> 19:07.487
Bring it.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.590
I did Sprite.

19:11.490 --> 19:13.326
That's independent.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.295
Then traded my night-light
for lip gloss.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.265
So independent.

19:18.297 --> 19:20.870
Which led to me tinkering
with my bedtime...

19:20.895 --> 19:22.602
So, then how did your body
find a rhythm? I'm sorry.

19:22.635 --> 19:24.103
That's all I can take right now.
I'll show myself out.

19:24.137 --> 19:26.106
I'm sorry I made you feel like

19:26.139 --> 19:28.004
you had to hate things
just because I do.

19:28.051 --> 19:29.176
<i>Th-That's unfair.</i>

19:29.208 --> 19:30.410
People should experience the joy

19:30.442 --> 19:32.112
of getting to negativity on their own,

19:32.144 --> 19:34.314
and if they never get there, great.

19:34.346 --> 19:36.616
And if Miggy loves temping,
good for him.

19:36.650 --> 19:38.752
Yeah, I've never seen him happier.

19:39.785 --> 19:41.755
He's here with your entire office.

19:41.787 --> 19:44.157
I'm coming down there, right now,

19:44.190 --> 19:47.180
and I'm going to be positive.

19:47.205 --> 19:48.561
It's been a while, though.

19:48.594 --> 19:49.929
Do people still say, "Boffo"?

19:49.962 --> 19:53.199
Okay, do not come to my place
of business and say, "Boffo."

19:53.233 --> 19:55.702
And I am at least going to
entertain the possibility

19:55.735 --> 19:57.603
of a positive outcome with Derek,

19:57.637 --> 19:59.339
which means letting him go.

19:59.371 --> 20:01.440
<i>If you can do it with Miggy,
I can do it with Derek.</i>

20:01.474 --> 20:03.277
I mean, it's not the same thing,
but what the hell.

20:03.310 --> 20:04.778
See you soon.

20:10.683 --> 20:12.733
"Need to discuss non-age-appropriate

20:12.758 --> 20:14.735
mass-casualty flight simulation game

20:14.760 --> 20:17.499
we paid good money for ASAP."

20:17.524 --> 20:18.558
Will.

20:23.321 --> 20:25.962
First of all, rock-solid e-mail.

20:26.042 --> 20:27.228
Derek.

20:29.726 --> 20:31.592
And then Graham was all,

20:31.655 --> 20:33.421
"Rib! Rib! Vertebrae!"

20:33.446 --> 20:35.304
What an amateur.

20:35.329 --> 20:37.464
Act like you've been there before, dude.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.062
So...

20:42.094 --> 20:44.630
we've been thinking about this a lot.

20:44.664 --> 20:45.866
And as much as we like

20:45.898 --> 20:48.302
making fun of everybody <i> for</i> you...

20:48.334 --> 20:51.370
It's more fun making fun
of everybody <i> with</i> you.

20:51.404 --> 20:54.408
So...

20:55.708 --> 20:57.710
How did you get this?

20:57.744 --> 20:59.379
- Don't ask.
- Don't ask.

20:59.411 --> 21:01.981
Oh, boy.

21:02.014 --> 21:04.017
Okay, back to the kids' table.
