<b>2x11 - Flying Mind</b>

00:06.651 --> 00:10.014
Dreadwing.
Damage report.

00:10.083 --> 00:14.055
We have suffered critical damage
of all major systems, lord Megatron.

00:14.123 --> 00:17.899
It will be some time before we
can get the ship airborne.

00:17.968 --> 00:19.830
Soundwave.

00:30.207 --> 00:33.508
So it was an Autobot who
crippled my vessel.

00:33.577 --> 00:36.913
They will move quickly to
exploit any perceived weakness.

00:36.982 --> 00:41.381
Surely they're not foolish enough
to launch a direct assault, my liege.

00:41.450 --> 00:46.387
Optimus has grown decidedly more
ruthless since our last encounter.

00:46.456 --> 00:51.392
Lord Megatron, as your physician,
I strongly vise against this.

00:51.461 --> 00:54.898
Dark Energon's regenerative
properties are impressive, but

00:54.967 --> 00:59.170
the side effects ... there is no
telling how it might impact the ship.

00:59.239 --> 01:02.940
Dark Energon courses
through my veins.

01:03.009 --> 01:07.980
Infusing the warship will enable me
to manipulate the craft as if we are one.

01:08.049 --> 01:12.653
And together, we shall crush
Optimus Prime.

02:00.171 --> 02:03.873
<i>But when the Insecticons
suddenly backed off, I got inspired </i>

02:03.942 --> 02:09.413
<i>by my proximity to the power core
and did what I do best.</i>

02:09.503 --> 02:12.640
You trashed Megatron's ride
like a rock star in a hotel room.

02:12.708 --> 02:15.609
We should hit the 'cons right
now while they're vulnerable.

02:15.678 --> 02:18.746
Megatron's warship may be
grounded, but let's not forget

02:18.765 --> 02:22.134
that we remain vastly
outnumbered, especially since

02:22.202 --> 02:25.104
has added the insecticon hive to
his ranks.

02:25.173 --> 02:28.007
Then maybe it's time for me
to call in an air strike.

02:28.076 --> 02:32.981
Or for us to consider more
extreme measures, Agent Fowler.

02:34.883 --> 02:37.050
The Spark extractor?

02:37.052 --> 02:40.954
Optimus, are you certain you
want to travel down this path?

02:40.956 --> 02:44.725
While I am deeply reluctant
to deploy a weapon of this caliber,

02:44.794 --> 02:49.964
especially one forged
by Decepticon hands, this may be

02:50.032 --> 02:54.535
our only chance to end the war
once and for all.

03:49.320 --> 03:53.423
Yes.
I can feel it!

03:54.492 --> 03:59.829
Optimus, I'm detecting a massive
energy spike at the Decepticon crash site.

03:59.898 --> 04:02.064
It appears to be dark Energon.

04:09.339 --> 04:17.379
Autobots, transform and roll out!

04:17.447 --> 04:19.047
Hold on, Prime.

04:19.116 --> 04:22.083
If you are gonna deploy some
kind of super weapon in the

04:22.152 --> 04:25.421
final showdown with the 'Cons,
it's my job as a representative

04:25.490 --> 04:28.377
of planet Earth to bear witness.

04:34.658 --> 04:37.242
Sweet lady Liberty.

04:42.241 --> 04:50.448
Optimus, you never disappoint.

04:50.517 --> 04:52.350
Bumblebee, now.

05:08.535 --> 05:10.401
<i>radius before it can activate.</i>

05:26.618 --> 05:29.956
Bumblebee!

05:32.024 --> 05:34.125
Mine!

05:38.764 --> 05:42.199
I didn't realize this ship
was equipped with a stasis beam.

06:25.844 --> 06:30.013
So much for christmas in Fiji.

06:33.185 --> 06:36.852
The Spark extractor!
Guide us closer so that I may

06:36.921 --> 06:40.722
collect what belongs to me
and destroy the Autobots.

06:50.266 --> 06:53.702
Team's down.
Requesting medevac.

06:58.742 --> 07:02.712
What?! Where are you going?!
I said closer!

07:02.780 --> 07:05.916
Lord Megatron, the ship seems
to be navigating itself.

07:05.984 --> 07:08.185
Override.

07:17.297 --> 07:21.867
The system's are bypassing
manual contr... ohhh!

07:24.904 --> 07:27.906
It appears the ship now
possesses a will of its own.

07:27.975 --> 07:33.212
Impossible!
Trace the problem to its source and fix it!

07:33.281 --> 07:38.684
<i>Do not tamper with my systems!
This will be your only warning!</i>

07:38.753 --> 07:39.986
Warning?!

07:40.054 --> 07:42.755
<i>My mission assumes priority.</i>

07:42.824 --> 07:47.827
<i>Any Cybertronian who interferes
will be neutralized.</i>

07:55.444 --> 07:59.848
My own vessel dares to
address me in threatening tones?! 

08:03.686 --> 08:07.221
It also seems to be doing a
better job of decoding the

08:07.290 --> 08:09.656
project Iacon database than we were.

08:09.725 --> 08:12.826
It's already deciphered a new
set of coordinates.

08:14.062 --> 08:19.064
And judging by our current course,
that is precisely where the ship is headed.

08:19.133 --> 08:22.802
As I desire.
You see, this warship is nothing

08:22.870 --> 08:25.504
more than an extension
of my very will.

08:25.573 --> 08:31.377
<i>Your will is nothing.
The Iacon artifact will belong to me.</i>

08:31.446 --> 08:35.780
I am Lord Megatron!
I command you to cease operations!

08:35.850 --> 08:39.852
<i>You are no longer in command.</i>

08:44.393 --> 08:49.564
Regain control of this vessel
by any means necessary.

08:59.174 --> 09:06.246
All hands, cut power to the mainframe
and disconnect data relays now!

09:43.419 --> 09:48.590
They're alive, but I've never
encountered this form of stasis lock.

09:48.658 --> 09:53.160
The 'cons are crossing the Atlantic,
making a beeline for North America.

09:53.229 --> 09:54.895
Wait. We can track them?

09:54.964 --> 09:56.831
Why aren't they cloaked, like usual?

09:56.900 --> 09:58.700
None of this makes a lick of sense.

09:58.768 --> 10:01.736
They had us in their cross hairs,
but the 'Cons just took off.

10:01.805 --> 10:04.273
They even bailed on that
Spark extractor thingy.

10:04.341 --> 10:06.709
Well, if the ship
isn't cloaked, maybe the

10:06.778 --> 10:08.711
communications relay's open,
and ...

10:08.780 --> 10:11.113
Yep, yep.
Are you suggesting that we just

10:11.182 --> 10:15.452
call Megatron and ask him what's
happening up there?!

10:31.167 --> 10:35.369
Lord Megatron, the computer has
decrypted a second set of coordinates.

10:35.438 --> 10:37.804
Perhaps we should permit it
to continue.

10:38.908 --> 10:42.042
<i>I do not require permission.</i>

10:42.111 --> 10:46.446
Autobot outpost Omega One
to Decepticon warship.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.615
Megatron, please respond.

10:57.323 --> 11:01.926
This mutiny ends now.

11:01.995 --> 11:06.130
Megatron.

11:07.467 --> 11:11.102
<i>Megatron has been
relieved of his command.</i>

11:11.170 --> 11:12.903
Who is this?

11:12.972 --> 11:14.839
<i>Who is this?!</i>

11:14.907 --> 11:18.108
Have you taken control of the
Decepticon vessel?

11:18.177 --> 11:20.243
<i>I am the vessel.</i>

11:20.312 --> 11:25.650
<i>Any Cybertronian who interferes
with my mission will be neutralized.</i>

11:29.689 --> 11:31.023
What mission?

11:31.091 --> 11:36.896
<i>Priority one ... decrypt Iacon database
and recover Decepticon technology.</i>

11:36.964 --> 11:39.932
For what purpose?

11:44.238 --> 11:46.338
It hung up?
Rude.

11:46.407 --> 11:49.174
Rude?! There's a giant
spaceship flying around

11:49.243 --> 11:52.210
collecting Decepticon
weapons of mass destruction!

11:52.279 --> 11:55.547
Wha... a giant spaceship filled
with neutralized Decepticons.

11:55.616 --> 11:56.181
Point?

11:56.250 --> 12:01.119
This could be our only chance to slip
aboard and download the Iacon database.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.555
So Optimus can decode it.

12:03.623 --> 12:07.592
Ingenious. I will infiltrate
the Decepticon warship.

12:07.661 --> 12:11.229
Not ingenious. You saw
what it did to the Decepticons.

12:11.298 --> 12:15.701
- And probably Megatron, too.
- And team Prime.

12:15.770 --> 12:18.904
But that tub had me dead to rights,
and I'm still breathing.

12:18.973 --> 12:21.840
The ship may be blind to humans.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.709
Very well, Agent Fowler.

12:23.777 --> 12:28.447
But at the first sign of trouble,
I am bridging you right back here.

12:28.516 --> 12:33.986
Now, in order to download the database,
you will need a compatible transfer drive.

12:34.055 --> 12:35.487
A what?

12:35.556 --> 12:39.624
- He'll also need tech support.
- And backup.

12:46.731 --> 12:48.765
Fowler to base.
We're in.

12:48.834 --> 12:53.069
<i>Good. Their data core should
be accessible from any console.</i>

12:59.578 --> 13:01.445
H-here's one.

13:08.087 --> 13:10.122
Doc Knock is knocked out.

13:10.191 --> 13:13.626
Look. The ship's decoded two
sets of Iacon coordinates.

13:16.530 --> 13:20.933
Three!
Let's rip and run.

13:34.745 --> 13:36.613
There's the port.

13:48.562 --> 13:52.598
Um, why is the warship
heading for Manhattan?

13:59.640 --> 14:04.378
Because that is where first
set of coordinates are located.

14:04.446 --> 14:07.881
<i>What would a relic from
Cybertron be doing in the Big Apple?</i>

14:07.950 --> 14:11.885
The Iacon relics landed on
Earth eons ago, Agent Fowler,

14:11.954 --> 14:15.422
long before the city was built atop it.

14:15.490 --> 14:18.159
Which means if the
ship wants this one...

14:18.160 --> 14:20.828
it may have to move some
buildings out of the way.

14:26.663 --> 14:30.565
Our mission just got complicated.
How do we deter this ship? 

14:30.634 --> 14:33.635
<i>I would advise disabling the
navigation module.</i>

14:33.704 --> 14:35.837
<i>Call up the main navigation menu.</i>

14:35.906 --> 14:38.506
- There.
- Step aside, son.

14:44.880 --> 14:45.812
Agent Fowler!

14:50.219 --> 14:55.122
<i>System access detected.
Interference will not be tolerated.</i>

14:55.190 --> 14:59.659
There.

14:59.728 --> 15:01.595
<i>Reveal yourself.</i>

15:08.971 --> 15:10.671
It doesn't see us.

15:10.740 --> 15:12.473
<i>Yet.</i>

15:12.542 --> 15:15.510
<i>The ship must not be scanning
for carbon-based life-forms.</i>

15:15.578 --> 15:17.845
But once it widens its search
parameters...

15:17.914 --> 15:19.280
We're toast.

15:19.349 --> 15:21.417
<i>I'm bridging you back.</i>

15:21.485 --> 15:25.121
No. There are millions of lives
at stake in New York, and we three

15:25.189 --> 15:27.823
are currently the only ones who
can do anything about it.

15:27.892 --> 15:29.658
You're out of your element, Jack.

15:29.727 --> 15:33.296
These readings, the ship's rapid
recovery all point to the fact

15:33.365 --> 15:36.767
that Megatron employed Dark
Energon to repair it.

15:36.835 --> 15:39.470
Hold on.
If you're saying the ship is

15:39.539 --> 15:42.840
fueled by dark Energon,
we can dump it, right?

15:42.909 --> 15:44.141
Hmm.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.611
You'll need to reserve the
warship's Energon infuser.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.815
<i>Follow the main overhead conduits.</i>

15:50.816 --> 15:53.950
<i>They'll lead you to the power core.</i>

16:17.474 --> 16:19.142
Megatron had the same idea.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.177
Then we're on the right track.

16:21.246 --> 16:25.382
<i>The Energon injection valve
can only be operated manually.</i>

16:25.451 --> 16:27.317
Manually?!

16:33.324 --> 16:36.862
Give me a boost.

17:05.858 --> 17:09.627
<i>I am infested with alien life-forms!</i>

17:09.695 --> 17:12.665
<i>Uh-Oh.
We just got made.</i>

17:29.215 --> 17:32.684
Whoa!

17:36.088 --> 17:38.523
Hurry.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.101
<i>All parasites will be eradicated!</i>

17:50.170 --> 17:52.037
Hey! Over here!

17:56.676 --> 18:01.782
- Jack, no!
- Run for it!

18:02.851 --> 18:04.717
Too slow!

18:28.339 --> 18:30.207
Oh!

18:40.187 --> 18:42.989
<i>Critical power drain.</i>

18:43.058 --> 18:47.760
<i>I am... in... command.</i>

18:51.798 --> 18:55.600
<i>Prepare to be... neutralized.</i>

19:10.115 --> 19:12.749
Run.

19:21.024 --> 19:22.758
Thank the Allspark.

19:23.828 --> 19:24.727
<i>Ratchet!</i>

19:26.998 --> 19:29.097
Fire up the ground bridge!

19:38.810 --> 19:40.710
On your feet, soldier.

19:40.779 --> 19:45.248
And beavers and ducks and
walnuts and ... grandma?

19:49.588 --> 19:51.956
That's all that's been downloaded?!

19:52.024 --> 19:53.824
The Iacon file must be huge!

19:56.095 --> 20:01.232
Sa-weet! Come on!
Here's our ride!

20:02.735 --> 20:08.306
- Jack?!
- Get Fowler out of here.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.941
Some is better than nothing.

20:10.010 --> 20:14.780
I'm not leaving without that drive.

20:21.455 --> 20:24.890
Say "ahh."

20:24.959 --> 20:27.927
I'm here to offer a second opinion.

20:45.079 --> 20:46.312
Lord Megatron, I ...

20:46.381 --> 20:48.730
You let them escape...

20:49.918 --> 20:52.852
with vital intelgence.

20:52.921 --> 20:57.055
The download of the Iacon
database may have been incomplete,

20:57.216 --> 21:00.960
but we now possess four
sets of coordinates decoded by the ship.

21:01.028 --> 21:07.366
Then we must act quickly, for
Megatron possesses the same four sets.

21:08.435 --> 21:12.106
<i>And he will not hesitate to
obtain the potential </i>

21:12.125 --> 21:17.008
<i>doomsday devices
which lie at the site of each.</i>

21:23.594 --> 21:27.979
