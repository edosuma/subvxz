Really, Michael and I
can't thank you enough.

00:56.255 --> 00:59.457
Well, how often does
my only daughter...

00:59.525 --> 01:03.194
Celebrate her first
wedding anniversary?

01:03.262 --> 01:04.796
Just think, Archie.

01:04.864 --> 01:10.501
Gloria and Mike have been
with us as man and wife
for one whole year.

01:10.569 --> 01:12.103
Ain't that wonderful?

01:19.311 --> 01:23.014
It's like celebrating
your 365th day
of a toothache.

01:26.886 --> 01:28.820
Where is the meathead anyhow?

01:28.888 --> 01:32.123
He ought to be here
with the food any minute.

01:32.191 --> 01:34.759
Daddy, will you please
stop calling him names?

01:34.827 --> 01:36.995
Tonight means something
to Michael and me,

01:37.063 --> 01:40.431
so why don't you just
join in the spirit
of the celebration?

01:40.499 --> 01:43.401
Yeah, it's their
first anniversary.

01:43.468 --> 01:46.104
That's the paper
anniversary, ain't it?
Yeah.

01:46.172 --> 01:49.107
Well, I'm right
in the spirit then.
I'm reading the paper.

01:50.810 --> 01:54.512
Here's the food.
Oh, hi, Michael.
Happy anniversary.

01:55.915 --> 02:00.018
Edith, tell them to cut that out
and bring the food over.

02:00.086 --> 02:03.421
All right, Archie.
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

02:03.488 --> 02:06.290
I'll get some nice bowls.
Never mind
the bowls, Edith.

02:06.358 --> 02:08.727
Just dish it out.
It's getting cold
in the bag.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.096
We got subgum chow mein.

02:11.163 --> 02:14.132
We got sweet and sour pork,
some fried rice,

02:14.200 --> 02:16.634
some egg rolls,
and what else?

02:16.702 --> 02:19.370
We got some
egg foo Yung.
Smells good.

02:19.438 --> 02:21.372
Let me fix
your plate, Archie.

02:21.440 --> 02:24.408
I got my own plate,
and I'm fixing it
myself.

02:24.476 --> 02:26.778
Where's
the sweet and sour?
Right over there.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.880
The best way to eat this...

02:28.948 --> 02:32.316
Is for everybody to taste
a little of everything.

02:32.384 --> 02:34.685
That's your way, Edith.
It ain't mine.

02:36.188 --> 02:39.791
Daddy, you're
hogging the rice.
<i>Here it is.</i>

03:02.447 --> 03:05.316
Why don't you eat, Archie?

03:05.384 --> 03:07.852
'Cause I ain't got
a fork, Edith.

03:09.721 --> 03:14.592
The kids thought since
it's a special occasion
and it's Chinese food,

03:14.660 --> 03:16.895
we'll all use chopsticks.

03:16.962 --> 03:18.963
I don't care
if it's chinks.
I want a fork.

03:20.732 --> 03:25.236
- Archie, it's Chinese food.
- That's what I said-- chinks.

03:25.304 --> 03:28.239
And I ain't knocking
the Chinese people
by saying that.

03:28.307 --> 03:32.076
It's just how I
and everybody I know
calls their food.

03:32.144 --> 03:34.078
And their laundries.

03:35.815 --> 03:39.650
Will you stay
out of this, huh?
That's what you call 'em.

03:39.718 --> 03:41.652
Will you
stifle yourself?

03:41.720 --> 03:46.858
Just the other day,
you told me to take your
shirts to the chinky laundry.

03:48.227 --> 03:50.394
I don't care what I told you.

03:50.462 --> 03:54.432
I'm telling you now,
I can't eat the food
with these chink pickup sticks,

03:54.499 --> 03:56.434
so get me a fork.

03:56.501 --> 03:58.736
Right away, Archie.
Gee, Archie.

03:58.804 --> 04:01.605
How can you talk like that?
With one word,

04:01.673 --> 04:04.309
you're putting away
an entire race of people.

04:04.376 --> 04:06.544
Yeah, that's right.
And not just the Chinese.

04:06.611 --> 04:09.380
The Laotians, the Cambodians,
the vietnamese, the Koreans--

04:09.448 --> 04:13.584
hold it there, meathead.
I never called them
countries chinks.

04:13.652 --> 04:16.387
No. He calls them gooks.

04:23.863 --> 04:26.297
You said they're
all your yellow race.

04:26.365 --> 04:29.934
They ain't exactly chinks,
but they're definitely
offshoots of your chinks.

04:30.002 --> 04:32.203
They're what you
call chinkish.

04:33.672 --> 04:37.608
Enough's enough.
I asked you not
to upset Michael and I.

04:37.676 --> 04:40.111
- What am I doing?
- Why shouldn't he upset me?

04:40.179 --> 04:42.646
Why is tonight any different?
Nothing's changed.

04:42.714 --> 04:45.516
I've been putting up
with the same bull ever
since the first time I met him.

04:45.584 --> 04:48.719
Don't remind me
of that, meathead,

04:48.787 --> 04:53.157
because that night
is stamped "inedibly"
on my heart,

04:53.225 --> 04:55.659
along with other
fond memories of the past...

04:55.727 --> 04:58.696
Like pearl harbor
and the crash of the <i>hindenburg.</i>

05:01.133 --> 05:03.501
I'll never forget
that night either.

05:03.568 --> 05:08.072
Gloria was
so cute and excited,
running around,

05:08.140 --> 05:12.877
and all because Mike was coming
to dinner for the first time.

05:12.945 --> 05:18.482
Ma. Ma. I looked all over
and I can't find
the linen napkins.

05:18.550 --> 05:21.886
They're ought to be
right there in that cabinet.

05:21.954 --> 05:24.923
- I looked and they're not here.
- That's funny.

05:24.990 --> 05:29.193
They were there when
I took 'em out a minute ago.

05:29.261 --> 05:32.263
Gloria, here they are.
Thanks, ma.

05:32.331 --> 05:36.901
Gee, they're beautiful.
Linen napkins.

05:36.969 --> 05:41.639
Should I bring
the crabmeat cocktail
out now or wait till later?

05:41.706 --> 05:45.944
Let's wait
till he comes.
Crabmeat cocktails.

05:46.011 --> 05:50.681
I better check the oven.
We don't wanna overcook
the roast duckling.

05:50.749 --> 05:53.617
Roast duckling.
Come on, Edith. What is this?

05:53.685 --> 05:56.387
Daddy, would you
please put on this tie?

05:56.455 --> 05:58.389
No, I won't put on no tie.

05:58.457 --> 06:00.925
What's going on around here?
What are youse doing?

06:00.993 --> 06:04.728
Linens napkins, when all
I ever get is paper towels.

06:04.796 --> 06:09.500
Crabmeat cocktails,
whereas the best I usually
get is the canned fruit cup...

06:09.568 --> 06:13.271
With the fruit cut up so small,
it looks like somebody
ate it before.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.375
What's this roast duckling?

06:17.443 --> 06:20.945
The last time your mother made
roast duckling for me was never.

06:21.013 --> 06:23.047
Now you're telling me
to put on a tie.

06:23.115 --> 06:26.750
What is it?
Who we entertaining here?
The count of monte "crisco"?

06:28.687 --> 06:31.655
Daddy, you're jealous.

06:31.723 --> 06:36.160
No, I ain't jealous.
I'm your father.
What are you talking about?

06:36.228 --> 06:40.231
I just wanna know
why we're putting on
all this doll, that's all.

06:40.299 --> 06:42.233
For one of them losers
of yours?

06:42.301 --> 06:46.504
Like that little shrimpy guy
with the no chin, used to have
all them nosebleeds?

06:47.706 --> 06:51.209
Arnold derosa.
Daddy, we were
12 years old.

06:51.276 --> 06:53.677
Don't make no difference.
You was always picking
losers, always,

06:53.745 --> 06:55.746
and I got a feeling
from the fuss
you're making now...

06:55.814 --> 06:58.549
That this guy tonight
is gonna be the biggest
loser of them all.

06:58.617 --> 07:01.785
How can you say that, daddy?
You haven't even
met him yet.

07:01.853 --> 07:04.455
I don't wanna meet him.
What do you think of that?

07:04.523 --> 07:08.493
You're not just fair. Ma!

07:08.560 --> 07:11.062
Ma.
What is it, Gloria?

07:11.130 --> 07:14.999
I got a feeling daddy's
gonna ruin everything
tonight. I just know it.

07:15.067 --> 07:19.870
What do I do?
You really like
this boy, don't you?

07:19.938 --> 07:23.007
Well, yeah.
A lot?

07:23.075 --> 07:25.143
Yeah.

07:25.210 --> 07:29.147
Would the word l-o-v-e
describe it?

07:30.416 --> 07:32.116
Yeah.

07:32.184 --> 07:35.586
Gloria, that's wonderful.

07:35.654 --> 07:39.557
Does Michael have
a firm handshake?
Huh?

07:39.624 --> 07:43.894
Your father likes a man
to have a firm handshake.

07:43.962 --> 07:46.464
He says it's a sign
of character.

07:46.532 --> 07:49.900
Ma, that's
ridiculous.
No, it's true.

07:49.968 --> 07:54.605
I remember one time
when your father had
a terrible toothache,

07:54.673 --> 07:58.142
so I took him
to the mcnab's dentist,
Dr. Marshall Herman.

07:58.210 --> 08:01.079
And your father said
that shaking hands with him...

08:01.146 --> 08:04.248
Was like shaking hands
with a wet washcloth,

08:04.316 --> 08:08.886
and he wouldn't let
no limp wrist inside his mouth.

08:08.954 --> 08:11.522
You know what he called
that dentist?

08:11.590 --> 08:15.093
- What, ma?
- He called him the tooth fairy.

08:22.534 --> 08:26.604
So, you see, if Michael
has a firm handshake,

08:26.671 --> 08:29.373
you got nothing
to worry about.
<i>[ Doorbell rings ]</i>

08:29.441 --> 08:31.576
Oh, ma, he's here.
Yeah.

08:31.643 --> 08:34.745
Do I look all right?
You look lovely.

08:37.082 --> 08:40.751
Archie, please be nice
to this boy.

08:40.818 --> 08:44.020
It's very im--
Edith, I'm always nice.

08:45.591 --> 08:48.159
Go let the jerk in.

08:48.227 --> 08:51.962
Daddy, please.
And, please, the tie.

08:52.030 --> 08:54.298
Yeah, Archie.
Here. Put the tie on.

08:54.366 --> 08:57.301
Cut that out, Edith.
What do I have
to wear this for?

08:57.369 --> 08:59.737
<i>[ Rings ]</i>
<i>Coming!</i>

09:14.253 --> 09:16.720
Michael, where's your tie?

09:16.788 --> 09:21.725
Well, I tried, Gloria,
but it doesn't look good
with an empty neck.

09:21.793 --> 09:26.497
Look, Edith, he wore
his Halloween costume.

09:26.565 --> 09:29.767
Put a tie on me.
Get rid of this thing here.

09:29.834 --> 09:32.570
Come on over here
and meet my parents.

09:32.638 --> 09:35.839
Ma, daddy,
this is Michael stivic.

09:35.907 --> 09:38.276
<i>Michael, this is</i>
<i>my mother, Mrs. bunker.</i>

09:38.343 --> 09:42.213
- Hi. How are you?
- How do you do?

09:43.915 --> 09:46.317
And my father, Mr. bunker.

09:51.089 --> 09:53.891
Daddy, this
is Michael stivic.

09:53.958 --> 09:58.128
- Michael--
- all right, Gloria,
we done that.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.464
I think we all know
who everybody is now.

10:00.532 --> 10:03.301
I knew everybody before.

10:06.338 --> 10:08.872
Except Mr. stivic.

10:10.309 --> 10:13.411
So, uh, you're
Mr. bunker.

10:13.478 --> 10:16.314
You figured
that out, huh?

10:20.118 --> 10:23.621
Michael, shake his hand hard.
Daddy likes that.

10:23.689 --> 10:26.724
Shake his hand, Archie.
Be nice. Go ahead.
Oh!

10:26.791 --> 10:28.226
Come on.

10:28.293 --> 10:30.428
All right, put 'er there.

10:33.131 --> 10:36.234
Ow!

10:36.301 --> 10:39.237
What the hell
kind of an animal
she bringing in here?

10:41.306 --> 10:44.242
He has a lot
of character.

10:44.309 --> 10:47.645
Mm, mm, mm,
mm, mm-mm-mm.

10:47.713 --> 10:51.115
Why don't you two sit down
and get better acquainted...

10:51.182 --> 10:54.785
While Gloria and me
finishing preparing the dinner.

10:54.853 --> 10:57.888
That's some nice tie
your guest is wearing there.

10:57.956 --> 10:59.890
Come on, Gloria.

11:08.734 --> 11:12.936
How would you like
to try this here chair?
'Cause that one's mine.

11:13.004 --> 11:14.938
Sorry.

11:26.151 --> 11:29.387
What kind
of a name is stivic?
Huh?

11:30.822 --> 11:34.325
Where you from?
Oh. Uh, Chicago.

11:35.527 --> 11:37.461
I mean, what's
your nationality?

11:39.264 --> 11:41.965
I'm an American.

11:42.033 --> 11:44.769
I mean, where
are your people from?

11:44.836 --> 11:46.704
They're from Poland.

11:56.181 --> 11:59.283
That would
make you Polish then, huh?

11:59.351 --> 12:00.651
Yeah.

12:07.158 --> 12:09.760
Anything interesting
in the paper?
Yeah.

12:09.828 --> 12:13.230
Two hundred arrested
at a Vietnam day
peace demonstration.

12:13.298 --> 12:16.367
Two hundred. They
should've thrown the whole
bunch of them in the can.

12:16.435 --> 12:19.203
Look at that picture there.
Here they are.

12:19.270 --> 12:22.473
Throwing all kinds
of junk and "deebris"
at officers of the law.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.475
Desecrating
on the American flag.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.677
What the hell do them
peaceniks want anyhow?

12:26.745 --> 12:30.047
Well, I think they just
don't like the idea...

12:30.114 --> 12:33.984
Of America fighting
an illegal and immoral war.

12:34.052 --> 12:37.187
Well, if they
don't like it,
they can lump it.

12:38.657 --> 12:41.091
Take it down the road
and dump it.

12:44.262 --> 12:46.831
You're saying,
"America, love it or leave it"?

12:46.898 --> 12:51.369
That's right.
It's a free country,
so amscray.

12:51.436 --> 12:54.104
Well, that would
include me too, Mr. bunker.

12:54.172 --> 12:56.640
Then toodle-oo
to you too.

12:58.076 --> 13:00.177
What would our leaving solve?

13:00.245 --> 13:03.447
With or without protests,
this country would still
have the same problems.

13:03.515 --> 13:05.182
What problems?

13:05.250 --> 13:08.552
The war, the racial problem,
the economic problem,
the pollution problem.

13:08.620 --> 13:11.389
Come on.
If you wanna nitpick--

13:11.456 --> 13:15.058
nitpick? Let me tell you
something, Mr. bunker.

13:15.126 --> 13:20.130
Let me tell you
something, Mr. stivic.
You are a meathead.

13:20.198 --> 13:24.568
- What did you call me?
- A meathead.
Dead from the neck up.

13:24.636 --> 13:26.670
Meathead.

13:26.738 --> 13:30.240
Yeah, now I see what your idea
of a free country is.

13:30.308 --> 13:33.243
You're free to say
anything you want, but
if anyone disagrees with you,

13:33.311 --> 13:35.446
they're thrown into jail
or called a meathead, right?

13:35.514 --> 13:38.816
That's right,
'cause this is America,
land that I love.

13:38.884 --> 13:42.887
I love it too,
and it's because I do, I protest
when I think things are wrong.

13:42.954 --> 13:44.522
