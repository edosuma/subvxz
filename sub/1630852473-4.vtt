00:02.794 --> 00:04.421
ANNOUNCER 1: <i>Remain seated, please.</i>

00:04.504 --> 00:06.840
(in Spanish)
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

00:07.424 --> 00:09.426
(lively music)

00:11.594 --> 00:12.679
(elephants trumpeting)

00:18.977 --> 00:20.228
MAN 1: <i>The love of liberty.</i>

00:20.478 --> 00:21.688
(moans)

00:21.771 --> 00:23.106
(screams)

00:30.613 --> 00:32.949
NARRATOR:
<i>If you've ever been to a Disney Park</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:36.244
<i>and looked upwards,
there's a good chance you'll see...</i>

00:36.327 --> 00:37.662
(firecracker crackles)

00:37.746 --> 00:41.249
<i>...a tall tower piercing the sky!</i>

00:41.332 --> 00:44.836
<i>And although none of these towers
look quite the same,</i>

00:44.919 --> 00:46.880
<i>when it comes to the way they sound...</i>

00:46.963 --> 00:49.215
-(creaking)
-(people screaming)

00:49.299 --> 00:53.762
<i>Well, that's the unmistakable squeal
of Disney Park's guests</i>

00:53.845 --> 00:57.557
<i>being thrilled
as they plummet directly downwards...</i>

00:59.267 --> 01:03.772
<i>and upwards on one of the world's
most advanced drop rides.</i>

01:06.691 --> 01:09.360
NARRATOR:
<i>With a theme lavished in Old Hollywood...</i>

01:09.444 --> 01:10.570
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Hollywood, California.</i>

01:10.653 --> 01:15.325
<i>It's an attraction that spans dimensions,
defies gravity,</i>

01:15.408 --> 01:18.369
<i>and in some cases becomes
something else entirely.</i>

01:18.453 --> 01:19.954
You're welcome!

01:20.538 --> 01:24.459
NARRATOR: <i>But the true origins
of Disney's famous drop ride,</i>

01:24.542 --> 01:26.669
<i>The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror...</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:30.465
<i>and later, Guardians
of the Galaxy, Mission: Breakout!</i>

01:30.548 --> 01:34.427
<i>actually do begin in Old Hollywood itself,</i>

01:34.511 --> 01:37.514
<i>the place where people have come
seeking fame and fortune</i>

01:37.597 --> 01:41.267
<i>since the 1920s,
including a young Walt Disney,</i>

01:41.351 --> 01:45.897
<i>who came over from Kansas City
to try his hand at becoming a big shot,</i>

01:45.980 --> 01:48.358
<i>which obviously worked out pretty well.</i>

01:48.441 --> 01:51.861
REPORTER 1: <i>This is the Walt Disney Studio
in California.</i>

01:51.945 --> 01:56.366
NARRATOR: <i>And in 1989,
Disney paid tribute to this bygone era</i>

01:56.449 --> 02:00.703
<i>with the grand opening of the Disney-MGM
Studios Theme Park in Florida.</i>

02:00.787 --> 02:03.790
-<i>Which was appropriately...</i>
-Dedicated to Hollywood.

02:03.873 --> 02:07.335
<i>-And very soon it was clear...</i>
-The park was wildly successful.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.296
REPORTER 2: <i>Everyone gave the new studios
a big thumbs-up.</i>

02:10.380 --> 02:13.550
It greatly exceeded our expectations
on many levels.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.885
NARRATOR: <i>The park had made
such an impression</i>

02:15.969 --> 02:17.846
<i>that Disney CEO Michael Eisner,</i>

02:17.929 --> 02:20.932
<i>along with COO Frank Wells,
gave the order to...</i>

02:21.015 --> 02:22.892
-Make it bigger.
-(audience cheer)

02:22.976 --> 02:27.105
So, we were given the task to expand
the park to meet the guest demand.

02:27.188 --> 02:31.568
So, what are we going to do
to expand this story?

02:31.651 --> 02:35.822
We were working on what was a doubling
of the studio tour in Florida

02:35.905 --> 02:37.365
as an expansion project.

02:37.448 --> 02:39.993
NARRATOR:
<i>Unlike their smaller Californian cousin,</i>

02:40.076 --> 02:42.287
<i>in Florida, space is not an issue.</i>

02:42.370 --> 02:44.080
<i>-However...</i>
-There are parameters.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.625
We already know we are in 1930s,
1940s Hollywood.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.252
GARY: <i>That's a parameter.</i>

02:49.335 --> 02:52.130
NARRATOR: <i>Also, it needed to be
based on an idea.</i>

02:52.213 --> 02:54.549
<i>outside of the current Disney catalog</i>

02:54.632 --> 02:55.633
GARY: <i>That's a parameter.</i>

02:55.717 --> 02:59.888
We also knew that the Walt Disney World
Resort needed another resort hotel.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.724
NARRATOR: <i>Oh, an actual hotel
as part of the attraction?</i>

03:02.807 --> 03:06.019
-That's a parameter. And...
<i>-What? There's another one?</i>

03:06.102 --> 03:09.189
Michael Eisner
was encouraging Imagineering

03:09.272 --> 03:13.109
to produce some sort
of attraction that had...

03:13.193 --> 03:14.611
(people screaming)

03:14.694 --> 03:17.614
...a controlled-drop-type experience
for the audience.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.240
(people screams)

03:19.324 --> 03:20.241
That's a parameter.

03:20.867 --> 03:24.579
NARRATOR: <i>Well, being resourceful
as they are, the Imagineers wondered...</i>

03:24.662 --> 03:27.916
-Could we have both?
-NARRATOR: <i>Both?</i>

03:27.999 --> 03:33.546
A real guest resort hotel along
with an elevator-drop-type experience.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.923
Because an elevator would be

03:35.006 --> 03:38.134
perfectly in continuity
to being within a hotel.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.678
NARRATOR:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, introducing...</i>

03:40.762 --> 03:42.305
GARY: <i>The Hollywood Tower Hotel.</i>

03:42.388 --> 03:44.474
<i>It would fit the time and place setting,</i>

03:44.557 --> 03:47.477
it fits the glamor of Hollywood
at the time.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.479
-NARRATOR: <i>It also...</i>
-It just wasn't gonna work.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.481
When I think of staying in a hotel,

03:51.564 --> 03:57.654
I think of restful, quiet,
peaceful place to sleep in contrast to...

03:57.737 --> 03:58.905
(people screams)

03:58.988 --> 04:01.950
...the screams that you might hear
from a thrill attraction.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.370
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, restful.</i>

04:05.453 --> 04:08.706
<i>So, with a "do not disturb" sign
put on that idea,</i>

04:08.790 --> 04:12.252
<i>the concept, however,
requested a late check-out.</i>

04:12.335 --> 04:14.087
The hotel idea stayed.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.089
NARRATOR:
<i>And the elevator-drop concept, too.</i>

04:16.172 --> 04:18.508
<i>But for that, guess who had a parameter.</i>

04:18.591 --> 04:21.928
Michael Eisner says,
"Well, I want the elevator doors

04:22.011 --> 04:25.098
<i>-to be able to open to the outside."</i>
-Oh, my gosh.

04:25.181 --> 04:28.643
Well, elevators don't move
when the doors are open. They stop.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.312
-NARRATOR: <i>Even still...</i>
-GARY: <i>That's a parameter.</i>

04:31.396 --> 04:34.023
Why would elevator doors
open to the exterior of a building?

04:34.107 --> 04:35.692
<i>-Good question.</i>
-Oh, yes.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.776
<i>But you have to admit...</i>

04:36.859 --> 04:38.611
So, having elevator doors
that could open up

04:38.695 --> 04:40.530
while you're 200 feet in the air,

04:40.613 --> 04:44.492
and you have a view out over
Central Florida, that's cool.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.245
-Who else is doing stuff like that?
-NARRATOR: <i>Absolutely no one.</i>

04:47.829 --> 04:50.373
<i>So, a drop ride based around an elevator</i>

04:50.456 --> 04:52.709
<i>with doors that open to the outside world,</i>

04:52.792 --> 04:55.712
<i>based on an acquired idea
that Disney could develop further.</i>

04:55.795 --> 04:58.548
<i>All set in a "Golden Age
of Hollywood" style hotel</i>

04:58.631 --> 05:00.842
<i>that's not actually a hotel.</i>

05:00.925 --> 05:01.968
<i>Easy enough?</i>

05:02.051 --> 05:06.264
<i>But if not an actual working hotel,
then what?</i>

05:06.347 --> 05:08.308
Perhaps it could be a haunted hotel.

05:08.391 --> 05:11.060
NARRATOR: <i>Well, there was already
The Haunted Mansion.</i>

05:11.144 --> 05:12.353
<i>Not exactly a hotel,</i>

05:12.437 --> 05:15.481
<i>but still, the haunted thing
was kind of covered.</i>

05:15.982 --> 05:17.191
<i>So instead, they thought...</i>

05:17.275 --> 05:20.653
You can have a ghost story
that's more the paranormal.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.821
NARRATOR: <i>Paranormal?</i>

05:21.904 --> 05:23.906
<i>In that case,
you probably can't go past...</i>

05:23.990 --> 05:27.535
-The Twilight Zone.
-MAN: <i>Your next stop, The Twilight Zone.</i>

05:27.618 --> 05:31.414
NARRATOR: <i>This iconic series
only ran for five years.</i>

05:31.497 --> 05:34.292
<i>But for many, it's a classic
that was ahead of its time.</i>

05:34.375 --> 05:39.380
<i>The Twilight Zone</i> episodes
always revolved around ordinary people...

05:39.464 --> 05:42.717
-This machine is predicting our future.
<i>-...in ordinary situations...</i>

05:42.800 --> 05:44.260
Do you think I could just
walk away from it?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.512
...where something extraordinary
happens to them.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.723
Tonight's story on <i>The Twilight Zone</i>

05:48.806 --> 05:51.809
is somewhat unique and calls
for a different kind of introduction.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.479
It's, like, fantastic.
It's a fantastic TV series.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.606
Somebody end this now!

05:56.689 --> 05:59.067
NARRATOR:
<i>But would it make a fantastic attraction?</i>

05:59.150 --> 06:01.819
This isn't just watching
an episode of <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

06:01.903 --> 06:03.196
We are now going to be in it.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.783
Oh, yes, it's good. It's very good.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.410
NARRATOR:
<i>The Imagineers sprang into action</i>

06:09.494 --> 06:11.996
<i>by kicking back
and watching all the episodes.</i>

06:12.080 --> 06:17.543
They watched every single episode
to try to find ideas for the attraction.

06:17.627 --> 06:21.214
NARRATOR: <i>And they did, but it wasn't
one specific episode.</i>

06:21.297 --> 06:24.092
<i>There was something
they all had in common.</i>

06:24.175 --> 06:26.344
Invariably, the stories dealt
with ordinary people

06:26.427 --> 06:27.845
in ordinary situations

06:27.929 --> 06:30.807
that have an extraordinary thing
happen to them.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.977
So, this idea of walking into a hotel

06:35.061 --> 06:38.356
<i>and confronting an elevator
that takes you to another dimension.</i>

06:38.439 --> 06:40.858
That's not fair.

06:40.942 --> 06:46.322
That's the twist that provides
us a doorway into The Twilight Zone.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.659
NARRATOR: <i>Yeah, but first, they needed
to provide an elevator door</i>

06:49.742 --> 06:51.369
<i>that opened to the outside</i>

06:51.452 --> 06:56.082
<i>and an entire premise for why on Earth
you ended up in The Twilight Zone.</i>

06:56.165 --> 06:58.042
<i>-But not to worry.</i>
-Coulter.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.670
NARRATOR: <i>Chief architect on the project,
Coulter Winn...</i>

07:00.753 --> 07:01.796
I'm an Imagineer.

07:01.879 --> 07:04.090
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, he'd work it out, wouldn't he?</i>

07:04.173 --> 07:06.509
So, one of the first ideas
I came up with was,

07:06.592 --> 07:09.053
"Well, I'm gonna make it look like
an earthquake hit this building

07:09.137 --> 07:11.597
<i>and part of it
collapsed in this calamity."</i>

07:11.681 --> 07:15.810
And Michael Eisner comes in,
looks at my illustration on the wall,

07:15.893 --> 07:17.353
and goes, "I hate it."

07:18.771 --> 07:21.023
First thing I did is
I call Michael Sprout up.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.651
I'm what's called the... the show writer.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.319
I'm thinking, I'm gonna lose my job.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.904
I've only been here for a couple of years,

07:26.988 --> 07:29.699
but I tell him the story
of what went wrong.

07:30.366 --> 07:33.494
I go, "Can't we make some
sort of phenomenon

07:33.578 --> 07:36.122
or something to dissolve part
of this building?

07:36.205 --> 07:37.790
Can't we do something?"

07:38.499 --> 07:41.252
'Cause, you know, this sort of,
like, seems... it didn't work out.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.712
NARRATOR: <i>And Michael Sprout thought...</i>

07:42.795 --> 07:45.423
If we could actually put you
in <i>The Twilight Zone,</i>

07:45.506 --> 07:47.925
-this would be something unique.
-NARRATOR: <i>But how?</i>

07:48.009 --> 07:50.261
"Hey, maybe there's
spiritual phenomenon out there

07:50.344 --> 07:53.514
that caused this building to disappear."

07:53.598 --> 07:56.017
-NARRATOR: <i>And like all the best ideas...</i>
-It was like lightning strike.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.644
-And it couldn't have been more perfect.
-NARRATOR: <i>And the idea...</i>

07:58.728 --> 08:01.731
This bolt of lightning
strikes the side of the building.

08:01.814 --> 08:05.109
NARRATOR:
<i>Oh, it was a bolt of lightning. Right!</i>

08:05.193 --> 08:07.236
A lightning bolt phenomenon
hits the building,

08:07.320 --> 08:09.906
vaporizes part of the building.
The guests...

08:09.989 --> 08:13.451
The elevator with the five guests,
you know, vanishes.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.120
To get that feeling of weightlessness
in the pit of their stomach.

08:16.204 --> 08:20.249
NARRATOR: <i>But would Coulter
dare present this idea to Michael Eisner?</i>

08:20.333 --> 08:22.126
Michael Eisner loved it.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.420
-NARRATOR: <i>With his idea well received...</i>
-Oh, yeah.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.756
-<i>and his job secure...</i>
-I felt much better.

08:26.839 --> 08:30.426
<i>The Twilight Zone Tower
of Terror attraction was all systems go.</i>

08:30.510 --> 08:31.469
We were off and running.

08:31.552 --> 08:34.472
NARRATOR: <i>Now they had to work out
the most logical way</i>

08:34.555 --> 08:36.182
<i>to create the ride system.</i>

08:36.265 --> 08:38.226
-But there was a problem.
-NARRATOR: <i>What? Already?</i>

08:38.309 --> 08:40.228
There's an elevator drops
in a lot of parks.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.938
And it kind of starts at the top,
and it just rolls down,

08:42.021 --> 08:44.982
and then you roll out, and you slow down
as you go around the ground.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.567
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, that actually sounds kind of fun.</i>

08:46.651 --> 08:48.528
-It's not what we wanted.
-NARRATOR: <i>Right, sure.</i>

08:48.611 --> 08:49.987
You wanna have that scary feeling.

08:50.071 --> 08:53.282
Tower of Terror was designed
to make you think it was an elevator,

08:53.366 --> 08:54.617
to feel like an elevator.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.160
NARRATOR: <i>Yeah, an elevator falling.</i>

08:56.244 --> 08:58.579
Elevator breaks loose and falls.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.707
It doesn't go out like that, it goes down,

09:01.791 --> 09:04.126
<i>and it has to stop
before you hit the ground.</i>

09:04.210 --> 09:05.169
(screeches)

09:05.253 --> 09:06.754
We could scare you to death in this thing.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.674
NARRATOR: <i>Now that sounds... fun?</i>

09:09.757 --> 09:12.635
<i>But nothing's as fun
as an office field trip.</i>

09:12.718 --> 09:14.136
We went to an elevator manufacturer.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.098
COULTER: <i>So, imagine if a bunch
of Disney Imagineers come in and say,</i>

09:17.181 --> 09:20.101
<i>"Hey, we want you
to help us build this attraction</i>

09:20.184 --> 09:22.395
<i>where the elevator falls."</i>

09:22.478 --> 09:24.605
And then they look at you
like you're crazy.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.276
We went to their tower
that was 300 feet tall, and they said...

09:28.359 --> 09:32.488
"You know, basically,
everything that we, as a company,

09:32.572 --> 09:36.075
have tried not to do
is what you would like us to do

09:36.158 --> 09:38.160
in the design and engineering
of this attraction."

09:38.244 --> 09:40.830
NARRATOR:
<i>But the question was could it be done?</i>

09:40.913 --> 09:43.666
BOB: <i>They said, "All we have to do
is take off the mechanism</i>

09:43.749 --> 09:47.211
that required this thing to slow down
to normal building standards."

09:47.295 --> 09:49.880
As the Imagineers
and one elevator engineer,

09:49.964 --> 09:52.550
who's gonna control this fall,
he hits the fall...

09:53.634 --> 09:56.220
<i>-and screams.</i>
-(screams)

09:56.304 --> 09:57.305
(people screaming)

09:57.388 --> 09:58.431
The elevator doors open,

09:58.973 --> 10:02.059
BOB: <i>Imagineers are all there,
the elevator guys are saying,</i>

10:02.143 --> 10:03.269
"What did you think?"

10:03.352 --> 10:07.815
NARRATOR:
<i>And Bob Weis could only muster four words.</i>

10:07.898 --> 10:09.066
It's not fast enough.

10:09.150 --> 10:12.653
We realized that for you
to feel that you're falling,

10:12.737 --> 10:15.239
it has to pull you, not drop you.

10:15.323 --> 10:19.327
NARRATOR: <i>So, throwing the laws of gravity
out the window, if that's even possible,</i>

10:19.410 --> 10:23.956
<i>the Imagineers devised a concept
that would put Isaac Newton to shame.</i>

10:24.790 --> 10:26.208
This vehicle's design

10:26.292 --> 10:30.463
<i>has cables that are attached to the top
and the bottom of the cab.</i>

10:30.546 --> 10:34.675
Whichever way the huge motors up
on top move is the way you move.

10:35.217 --> 10:38.971
TJ: <i>It actually pulls you down
faster than the acceleration of gravity.</i>

10:39.055 --> 10:40.806
NARRATOR: <i>Faster than gravity?</i>

10:40.890 --> 10:43.643
Gravity doesn't pull you down,
the ride is pulling you down.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.978
NARRATOR:
<i>Now the Imagineers had defied gravity</i>

10:46.062 --> 10:48.689
<i>and were bending the laws
of nature to their will.</i>

10:48.773 --> 10:50.149
All the rules are off.

10:50.232 --> 10:53.861
NARRATOR: <i>Developing an incredibly
powerful motorized pulley system,</i>

10:53.944 --> 10:56.238
<i>they soon discovered that what goes down</i>

10:56.322 --> 11:01.118
<i>must also come up at incredible speed
and then down again.</i>

11:02.078 --> 11:04.497
All heck breaks loose
as you start to go up and down.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.665
NARRATOR: <i>Nice! That'll work.</i>

11:05.748 --> 11:08.167
They're always pulling one rabbit
out of the hat after another.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.128
NARRATOR: <i>But for their next trick,
they'd need more than magic,</i>

11:11.212 --> 11:12.963
<i>because they wanted to go...</i>

11:13.714 --> 11:15.341
Into the fifth dimension.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.640
The elevator needed
to leave the elevator shaft.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.392
NARRATOR: <i>Leave? What on Earth?</i>

11:24.475 --> 11:28.270
-Now you're going horizontally...
-GARY: <i>And that alone informs the guests</i>

11:28.354 --> 11:30.147
<i>that we're now moving
into the fifth dimension,</i>

11:30.231 --> 11:32.400
and we have absolutely no idea
what's going to happen.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.818
NARRATOR: <i>But the Imagineers did.</i>

11:33.901 --> 11:37.363
The fifth dimension
was based on technology.

11:37.446 --> 11:39.490
That is, an autonomous vehicle,

11:39.573 --> 11:41.909
sits on top of essentially
a lifting platform,

11:41.992 --> 11:43.953
a vertical vehicle conveyance platform.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.831
NARRATOR:
<i>And this patented trackless ride system</i>

11:46.914 --> 11:49.583
<i>allowed guests to board a bank of seats</i>

11:49.667 --> 11:52.628
<i>that could go, well,
wherever they wanted to.</i>

11:52.712 --> 11:56.674
Those vehicles are actually following
the little eighth of an inch guide wire

11:56.757 --> 11:58.676
<i>that's underneath the concrete.</i>

11:58.759 --> 12:00.970
<i>It picks up a signal and it follows that.</i>

12:01.971 --> 12:03.347
NARRATOR: <i>So, to summarize...</i>

12:03.431 --> 12:05.224
The way Tower of Terror in Florida
is designed,

12:05.307 --> 12:07.226
you basically have
two independent ride systems

12:07.309 --> 12:09.353
<i>that are sitting side by side
in the building.</i>

12:09.437 --> 12:12.606
NARRATOR: <i>Guests who dared enter
the attraction would walk into a...</i>

12:12.690 --> 12:15.735
-Autonomous vehicle.
<i>-...that would move onto a...</i>

12:15.818 --> 12:18.154
-Vertical vehicle conveyance platform.
-NARRATOR: <i>Right.</i>

12:18.237 --> 12:20.573
MIKE: <i>So, as guests come up
through the load shaft,</i>

12:20.656 --> 12:21.949
once they get to the fifth dimension...

12:22.032 --> 12:25.327
NARRATOR: <i>That trackless ride system
kicks in, and you go...</i>

12:25.411 --> 12:26.620
Across the building floor.

12:26.704 --> 12:30.499
NARRATOR: <i>As you do, driving about in
the fifth dimension, which leads you to...</i>

12:30.583 --> 12:31.542
The drop shaft.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.170
NARRATOR:
<i>Where you plummet upwards and downwards.</i>

12:34.253 --> 12:36.630
In the dark, several times,

12:36.714 --> 12:39.550
before it finally gets to the basement
level where it backs out,

12:39.633 --> 12:41.302
<i>basically allows guests to unload.</i>

12:41.385 --> 12:44.013
NARRATOR: <i>Then returning you back
to the third dimension,</i>

12:44.096 --> 12:48.058
<i>or otherwise known as real life,
the place where construction</i>

12:48.142 --> 12:51.604
<i>on the brand-new,
200-foot-tall tower was happening.</i>

12:51.687 --> 12:56.776
-It was gonna be taller.
-We ended up maxing out at 199 feet 11.

12:56.859 --> 12:57.985
NARRATOR: <i>And the reason why?</i>

12:58.068 --> 13:01.030
Any building over 200 feet tall,
internationally,

13:01.113 --> 13:05.117
<i>has to have a flashing
red aircraft warning light on it.</i>

13:05.201 --> 13:08.370
That really wasn't gonna work
with our abandoned hotel story.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.039
Tonight's story on <i>The Twilight Zone</i>

13:10.122 --> 13:12.082
<i>is somewhat unique
and calls for a different...</i>

13:12.166 --> 13:17.797
So, we literally design the building
to 199 feet, 11 inches and change.

13:18.839 --> 13:22.259
Just to avoid having to have the blinky
red light on top of the building.

13:22.343 --> 13:25.346
NARRATOR: <i>Well, if not a big, red,
blinking aviation light,</i>

13:25.429 --> 13:27.348
<i>then what would be up there?</i>

13:27.431 --> 13:30.392
COULTER: <i>One of the things
I was really tasked to do</i>

13:30.476 --> 13:32.269
was to give this a scary profile.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.564
<i>Now, you think of Mickey Mouse.
Mickey is three circles.</i>

13:35.648 --> 13:41.153
Circles are friendly, they're endearing.
But spiky, pointy things are not.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.824
They're very off-putting,
you know, kind of eerie.

13:44.907 --> 13:49.036
And you get the silhouette of the chimneys
or the finials and all the spires.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.622
NARRATOR: <i>So, as Coulter worked
to terrify onlookers...</i>

13:51.705 --> 13:53.582
Yeah, right now,
it's just beginning to take shape.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.708
You look to the top of the building,

13:54.792 --> 13:56.752
you'll be able to see a little
more of the architecture.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.129
NARRATOR:
<i>But not just any old architecture.</i>

13:59.213 --> 14:02.925
It's got that Pueblo Deco style
that's very Hollywood.

14:03.008 --> 14:06.178
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, Pueblo Deco,
infused elements of Art Deco</i>

14:06.262 --> 14:08.222
<i>and Pueblo Revival design.</i>

14:08.305 --> 14:09.431
YOUNG COULTER: <i>Which is a real style,</i>

14:09.515 --> 14:11.684
but what we're doing
is trying to communicate

14:11.767 --> 14:14.144
with the existing Hollywood
backlot architecturally.

14:14.228 --> 14:17.731
NARRATOR: <i>And to work that out,
well, they had another office field trip.</i>

14:17.815 --> 14:21.151
So, of course, we looked at hotels
that might be inspiration,

14:21.235 --> 14:24.989
<i>hotels in Los Angeles
that would fit the time and place setting,</i>

14:25.072 --> 14:30.494
and that all sort of fed
into developing that hotel story for us.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.998
NARRATOR: <i>A story that mostly took place
inside the building.</i>

14:34.081 --> 14:38.210
Then we brought in this
whole Hollywood glamor,

14:38.294 --> 14:40.838
you know, the "Golden Age
of Hollywood" feel.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.632
COULTER: <i>The interior lobby
for Tower of Terror Florida</i>

14:43.716 --> 14:46.010
<i>is reminiscent of the elegance
of those days,</i>

14:46.093 --> 14:48.012
but it's also kind of creepy.

14:48.095 --> 14:52.766
Our set decorators
scoured estate sales, scoured shops,

14:52.850 --> 14:56.061
did everything they could to find keys
or a tie-in,

14:56.145 --> 14:59.481
even an overt nod to specific episodes.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.775
It's nothing like seeing it in real life.

15:01.859 --> 15:06.780
NARRATOR: <i>Whether the guests notice
this level of detail and overt nodding...</i>

15:06.864 --> 15:08.782
-You may never know.
-NARRATOR: <i>What we do know</i>

15:08.866 --> 15:12.745
<i>is that in their pursuit
of replicating that very special era...</i>

15:12.828 --> 15:16.498
-Hollywood in the 1930s.
<i>-...the Imagineers had a lot of fun</i>

15:16.582 --> 15:19.293
<i>with the Disney credit card
at the antiques store.</i>

15:19.376 --> 15:21.670
<i>And by the summer of 1994...</i>

15:21.754 --> 15:23.881
-We're getting there.
<i>-they were getting there.</i>

15:23.964 --> 15:26.967
<i>Now, as for the story
they were constructing...</i>

15:27.051 --> 15:30.596
GREG: <i>The story that we had come up with
was in an elevator cab,</i>

15:30.679 --> 15:33.557
<i>this group of five people
are riding up the elevator,</i>

15:33.641 --> 15:37.436
this bolt of lightning strikes
the side of the building

15:37.519 --> 15:42.191
and creates this amazing energy
that courses through the building,

15:42.274 --> 15:45.319
culminating in the complete
disappearance of those people

15:45.402 --> 15:46.570
from inside the elevator.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.198
The lights and the thunder,
and they would just...

15:49.281 --> 15:51.283
-(electricity crackles)
-...totally disappear.

15:51.367 --> 15:57.039
The doors open, we enter into what looks
to be like maybe a maintenance elevator,

15:57.122 --> 16:00.292
and we sit down, and we realize...

16:00.376 --> 16:04.922
People had been there five seconds before,
and they just vanished.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.424
This may not turn out well for us.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.677
NARRATOR: <i>Yep, it might not.</i>

16:09.760 --> 16:13.764
<i>Really. It was a plot
that could have come out of any episode.</i>

16:13.847 --> 16:17.935
This town happens to lie
on the outskirts of The Twilight Zone.

16:18.018 --> 16:21.855
<i>Tower of Terror</i> was a film noir.
Right? A mystery.

16:21.939 --> 16:26.026
An exploration.
So, a buildup of tension, and...

16:26.110 --> 16:30.155
And by the time you're sort of
having the story and story and story,

16:30.239 --> 16:32.074
and then you're like, boom!

16:32.533 --> 16:34.410
NARRATOR: <i>So, true to this formula...</i>

16:34.493 --> 16:36.537
Wouldn't it be great
if we could get Joe Dante

16:36.620 --> 16:39.289
who had directed a portion
of The Twilight Zone movie?

16:39.373 --> 16:40.207
And action!

16:40.290 --> 16:42.876
NARRATOR: <i>Now all they needed was
Rod Serling himself,</i>

16:42.960 --> 16:46.130
<i>the creator and host of</i> The Twilight Zone.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.674
<i>Really, they couldn't do it without him.</i>

16:48.757 --> 16:52.761
Sadly, he had passed away about 20 years
before our attraction opened,

16:52.845 --> 16:56.557
which makes it challenging on
how do you put...

16:56.640 --> 16:58.892
make it authentically
a Rod Serling attraction.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.103
NARRATOR:
<i>Oh, come on. These are Imagineers.</i>

17:01.186 --> 17:04.648
<i>They defied gravity
and the various dimensions in general.</i>

17:04.732 --> 17:06.108
<i>They'll work something out.</i>

17:06.191 --> 17:09.695
Using digital technology
and a wonderful voice-over actor

17:09.778 --> 17:11.739
who provides the voice for Rod...

17:11.822 --> 17:13.657
...calls for a different
kind of introduction.

17:14.283 --> 17:17.536
This is, as you may recognize,
is a maintenance service elevator.

17:17.619 --> 17:18.829
NARRATOR: <i>But the question was,</i>

17:18.912 --> 17:22.958
<i>did they deliver
an authentic Twilight Zone experience?</i>

17:23.042 --> 17:24.918
As we visit the hotel today,

17:25.586 --> 17:27.588
everything looks like it was left

17:27.671 --> 17:31.216
just as it was at that moment
when the bolt of lightning struck.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.928
GREG: <i>And there is a staff of people
still working in the hotel.</i>

17:35.012 --> 17:37.056
And it seemed like
they're in on something.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.891
And then, suddenly, the lights go down,

17:38.974 --> 17:42.144
and there's a flicker
on an old television up in the corner.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.855
<i>And there appears Rod Serling.</i>

17:45.397 --> 17:47.191
Tonight's story on <i>The Twilight Zone</i>

17:47.274 --> 17:50.402
is somewhat unique and calls
for a different kind of introduction.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.280
And so, now it's up to you,
if you're brave enough,

17:53.363 --> 17:54.531
<i>to board one of the elevators.</i>

17:54.615 --> 17:59.453
NARRATOR: <i>Well, on July 22nd, 1994,
people were very much brave enough</i>

17:59.536 --> 18:02.164
<i>to go on The Twilight Zone
Tower of Terror.</i>

18:02.247 --> 18:06.126
<i>Something very strange is going on
at Disney-MGM Studios.</i>

18:06.835 --> 18:09.088
<i>Screams have been heard coming
from a 200-foot...</i>

18:09.171 --> 18:13.092
-A hundred ninety-nine feet eleven.
<i>-...tower jutting into the sky.</i>

18:13.175 --> 18:16.428
<i>Checking in to this hotel will make
your hair stand on end.</i>

18:16.512 --> 18:19.765
<i>And for the rest of the '90s,
hairs stayed on end.</i>

18:20.057 --> 18:23.519
<i>And Tower of Terror became one
of the most popular attractions</i>

18:23.602 --> 18:25.604
<i>at Disney's Hollywood Studios.</i>

18:25.687 --> 18:27.481
-I won't ride again today.
-I will.

18:27.564 --> 18:30.984
NARRATOR: <i>And soon,
at other Disney Parks around the world.</i>

18:31.068 --> 18:33.237
Tower of Terror
for Florida was so popular,

18:33.320 --> 18:35.572
we knew we had to put it in other places.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.616
GREG: <i>So, Disney's California Adventure,</i>

18:37.699 --> 18:40.077
when we had the opportunity
to expand and add it there.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.745
NARRATOR: <i>But as that park expanded,</i>

18:42.121 --> 18:45.415
<i>for California Adventure,
the attraction shrunk a little.</i>

18:45.499 --> 18:48.293
California has three individual
show scenes,

18:48.377 --> 18:52.005
<i>all of which can be working at any time
and eliminates the need</i>

18:52.089 --> 18:55.259
for two very expensive other shafts
to have to be built.

18:55.342 --> 18:58.095
It can do the whole thing with one.
Much more efficient.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.972
NARRATOR:
<i>But if you're looking for efficiency,</i>

19:00.055 --> 19:04.768
<i>across the Pacific Ocean in Japan,
a new and exciting park was opening.</i>

19:05.602 --> 19:09.857
<i>But unlike the original Tokyo Disneyland,
which was basically where they...</i>

19:09.940 --> 19:12.651
Take Disneyland and move it to Tokyo.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.695
NARRATOR:
<i>That wouldn't work this time because...</i>

19:14.778 --> 19:18.031
The Japanese know nothing
about <i>The Twilight Zone</i> series.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.533
It's irrelevant to them.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.995
This, as you may recognize,
is a map of the United States.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.205
They knew that they had to come up
with a different story.

19:25.289 --> 19:30.252
And what they decided to do
was to create a unique story,

19:30.335 --> 19:32.171
unique to Tokyo DisneySea.

19:32.254 --> 19:37.176
We created this story
about this interesting man.

19:37.259 --> 19:41.305
GREG: <i>Harrison Hightower III
is this wealthy explorer</i>

19:41.388 --> 19:45.142
<i>who loved to travel and go
to different lands throughout the world</i>

19:45.225 --> 19:46.393
<i>and collect artifacts.</i>

19:46.476 --> 19:48.312
<i>Basically, pillage cultures.</i>

19:48.604 --> 19:53.525
<i>On one of his adventures,
he found this idol called Shiriki Utundu.</i>

19:53.609 --> 19:56.153
<i>He takes it
before the natives can stop him.</i>

19:56.737 --> 20:00.532
<i>He whisks it away takes it
with him back to his hotel.</i>

20:00.616 --> 20:04.494
Looking at his idol in his penthouse
at the top of the tower,

20:04.578 --> 20:09.166
<i>and it came to life,
pushed him down the elevator.</i>

20:09.249 --> 20:11.627
-The elevator crashed.
-(electricity crackles)

20:11.710 --> 20:14.463
DANIEL: <i>But when they pulled apart
the elevator,</i>

20:14.546 --> 20:18.175
there was no one inside
except for the idol, Shiriki Utundu.

20:18.258 --> 20:22.304
NARRATOR: <i>Well, a convincing story
is one thing, but to really get this done,</i>

20:22.387 --> 20:25.933
<i>they couldn't do it alone.
So, with a simple call to the wild...</i>

20:27.309 --> 20:32.522
<i>help came, stumbling out of the mountains
in the form of this guy.</i>

20:32.606 --> 20:35.609
JOE: <i>An artist, a painter, a sculptor,
and a set designer.</i>

20:35.692 --> 20:38.612
-NARRATOR: <i>He's also a professor and...</i>
-I'm an Imagineer.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.906
I have been for almost 40 years.

20:40.989 --> 20:44.159
NARRATOR: <i>As the lead Imagineer
on Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park,</i>

20:44.243 --> 20:47.871
-<i>Joe is a veritable lion among Imagineers.</i>
-(lion growls)

20:47.955 --> 20:51.291
I'm a storyteller who works
with real materials to tell stories.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.878
All I've ever heard about Joe Rohde
is that he's a genius.

20:54.962 --> 20:59.591
I don't write and I don't use film.
My stories are created with real stuff.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.678
You go to Animal Kingdom,
that is Joe on a plate.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.597
NARRATOR:
<i>He also put Mount Everest in a theme park,</i>

21:05.681 --> 21:09.559
<i>specifically Expedition Everest
at Disney's Animal Kingdom.</i>

21:09.643 --> 21:11.770
I had just gotten back from the Himalayas

21:11.853 --> 21:14.940
because I was working
on Expedition Everest.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.984
JOE: <i>I had this great big beard.</i>

21:17.067 --> 21:21.697
NARRATOR: <i>Instead of requesting designs
from this legendary bearded Imagineer...</i>

21:21.780 --> 21:26.785
They requested that I model
for one corbel.

21:26.868 --> 21:28.161
-NARRATOR: <i>Sorry, a what?</i>
-A corbel.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.371
NARRATOR: <i>Oh, yeah, a corbel.</i>

21:29.454 --> 21:31.915
<i>A kind of bracket for a building
made out of art.</i>

21:32.666 --> 21:33.834
That's the thing.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.461
NARRATOR: <i>But it's a thing that remains
firmly in one place.</i>

21:36.545 --> 21:40.632
On the outside of the building,
there's a place where this window comes up

21:40.716 --> 21:44.803
and there's this scowling face
built into the corbel.

21:44.886 --> 21:46.763
And I have a good scowl-y forehead,

21:46.847 --> 21:50.600
and so I was used as the model
for this scowling face.

21:51.768 --> 21:56.773
And then the next thing it turned into
was architectural elements like murals

21:56.857 --> 22:00.444
<i>and stained glass windows
and whole installations.</i>

22:00.902 --> 22:06.450
So that in the end, there's something
like a thousand images of my face

22:06.533 --> 22:10.871
as this character all over that building.
It's very peculiar.

22:11.788 --> 22:15.208
So I ended up shooting
all these Japanese language commercials

22:15.292 --> 22:16.543
<i>as Harrison Hightower.</i>

22:17.127 --> 22:19.129
-(screaming)
-(electricity crackles)

22:21.214 --> 22:23.091
MAN 2: <i>Tower of Terror!</i>

22:23.175 --> 22:24.801
A very, very odd experience.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.637
NARRATOR:
<i>But while Joe's beard was big in Japan,</i>

22:27.721 --> 22:31.099
<i>heading westward to a place
that specializes in towers,</i>

22:31.641 --> 22:35.312
<i>Disneyland Paris was looking
to build a new one, American style.</i>

22:35.479 --> 22:38.315
Paris is identical to California.

22:38.398 --> 22:41.943
The only big change is that
it's a concrete building, not steel.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.403
NARRATOR: <i>Oh, la, la.</i>

22:43.487 --> 22:45.072
They built buildings out of concrete.

22:45.155 --> 22:49.785
NARRATOR: <i>But it's not just the world's
most romantic building material or city.</i>

22:49.868 --> 22:51.661
<i>Things are a little different in France.</i>

22:51.745 --> 22:54.623
So, we looked at the story
that was in there and said,

22:54.706 --> 22:57.167
"You know, let's pull
a character out of that story."

22:57.250 --> 22:59.628
And there's a little girl
that's featured in that story.

23:00.170 --> 23:04.424
Let's make her the star now of the ride

23:04.508 --> 23:08.303
and have her sort of step
out of The Twilight Zone static and say,

23:08.387 --> 23:10.430
"I wouldn't go in there if I were you."

23:10.514 --> 23:12.099
-NARRATOR: <i>With nothing more terrifying</i>
-I wouldn't go in there

23:12.182 --> 23:13.225
-if I were you.
<i>-...than a creepy kid,</i>

23:13.308 --> 23:15.227
<i>Disneyland Paris was set,</i>

23:15.852 --> 23:19.356
<i>and Tower of Terror
was on all four corners of the globe.</i>

23:19.439 --> 23:22.317
REPORTER 3: <i>Thirteen-story Twilight Zone
Tower of Terror.</i>

23:22.401 --> 23:24.569
ROD: <i>Wave goodbye to the real world.</i>

23:24.653 --> 23:26.196
NARRATOR:
<i>And the little scary girl's warning...</i>

23:26.279 --> 23:28.281
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.117
<i>...was thoroughly ignored.</i>

23:30.575 --> 23:32.411
(people screaming)

23:32.494 --> 23:34.162
NARRATOR: <i>And for the coming decade...</i>

23:34.246 --> 23:37.749
It is one of the most popular attractions
at Disney California Adventure.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.252
-Disneyland Paris.
-(people scream)

23:40.335 --> 23:42.087
-JEANETTE: <i>Walt Disney World...</i>
-Tokyo DisneySea...

23:42.170 --> 23:43.171
People loved it.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.924
NARRATOR:
<i>And they kept loving it year after year.</i>

23:46.007 --> 23:48.385
<i>Guests came back again and again</i>

23:48.468 --> 23:52.264
<i>as the Tower of Terror
stood proudly as a beacon</i>

23:52.347 --> 23:56.810
<i>of unchanging, terrifying perfection.</i>

23:56.893 --> 24:00.897
<i>One might assume that
it would stay that way forever.</i>

24:00.981 --> 24:01.898
<i>However...</i>

24:01.982 --> 24:05.861
-Walt Disney said...
-Disneyland will never be complete.

24:05.944 --> 24:06.945
NARRATOR: <i>He also said...</i>

24:07.028 --> 24:08.864
There will always be
something new and unusual.

24:08.947 --> 24:09.823
<i>-Right.</i>
-Right?

24:09.906 --> 24:10.782
<i>-Right.</i>
-Mm-hm.

24:10.866 --> 24:14.411
NARRATOR: <i>Well, it just so happened that
the Disney California Adventure Park</i>

24:14.494 --> 24:18.248
<i>was looking to have a new
and unusual attraction</i>

24:18.331 --> 24:23.795
<i>up and running by Memorial Day 2017,
which was only about 11 months away.</i>

24:24.421 --> 24:25.589
Oh, my.

24:25.672 --> 24:28.717
<i>Clearly not enough time
to build a new attraction from scratch,</i>

24:28.800 --> 24:32.429
<i>the Imagineers set their sights
on taking an existing attraction</i>

24:32.512 --> 24:34.306
<i>and sprucing it up a little.</i>

24:34.389 --> 24:36.975
And some people call this reprogramming.

24:37.058 --> 24:38.727
-Or...
-NARRATOR: <i>Sprucing up?</i>

24:38.810 --> 24:40.228
-Changing up.
-NARRATOR: <i>Good enough.</i>

24:40.312 --> 24:41.771
And now you have the opportunity

24:41.855 --> 24:45.817
to take something that the guest
already knows as an experience

24:45.901 --> 24:47.819
and give them something
that they weren't expecting.

24:47.903 --> 24:50.947
NARRATOR: <i>As for working out
which attraction that would be,</i>

24:51.031 --> 24:53.283
<i>they turned to the model Imagineer,</i>

24:53.366 --> 24:56.870
<i>-or at least the guy who modeled...</i>
-For one corbel.

24:56.953 --> 25:00.874
<i>But this time,
they wanted him to take just one look</i>

25:00.957 --> 25:02.876
<i>at the Disney California Adventure Park.</i>

25:02.959 --> 25:06.963
Joe is always game
for any kind of experience.

25:07.047 --> 25:11.384
NARRATOR: <i>And one such experience
was when he partnered with Jeanette Lomboy</i>

25:11.468 --> 25:15.263
<i>to create Aulani,
a Disney resort and spa in Hawaii.</i>

25:15.347 --> 25:20.519
I think to create these places
that are based on culture

25:20.602 --> 25:23.939
<i>and have this richness and depth,
you have to be that.</i>

25:24.022 --> 25:28.026
NARRATOR: <i>So, with that
Memorial Day 2017 deadline looming,</i>

25:28.109 --> 25:32.322
<i>Disney approached these
cultural specialists and asked...</i>

25:32.405 --> 25:37.619
Uh, so... how about we convert
Tower of Terror by Memorial Day?

25:37.702 --> 25:40.163
<i>Although not exactly in his wheelhouse,</i>

25:40.247 --> 25:44.000
<i>the legendary Imagineer
must have been between projects, so...</i>

25:44.084 --> 25:48.713
That's the same day
I am opening Pandora: The World of Avatar.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.383
NARRATOR: <i>So, not between projects at all.</i>

25:51.466 --> 25:52.801
(speaking Na'vi)

25:52.884 --> 25:57.264
NARRATOR: <i>Because this expansive world,
being built in Florida, mind you,</i>

25:57.347 --> 26:00.100
<i>had Joe's hands very full, so...</i>

26:00.183 --> 26:03.311
-So...
-(screaming)

26:03.395 --> 26:04.813
How's that gonna work?

26:04.896 --> 26:07.816
NARRATOR: <i>Putting that impressive
furrowed brow to good use...</i>

26:07.899 --> 26:13.113
I have a common, initial, cranky response.

26:13.196 --> 26:15.198
NARRATOR:
<i>But he thought he'd have a look anyway.</i>

26:15.282 --> 26:17.534
<i>And using
those Animal Kingdom instincts...</i>

26:17.617 --> 26:18.743
I approach from behind,

26:18.827 --> 26:21.913
so I'm not really seeing the theming
of the building.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.957
JOE: <i>Just a mass. And...</i>

26:24.040 --> 26:27.836
NARRATOR: <i>And, as he looked upwards,
Joe Rohde realized...</i>

26:27.919 --> 26:32.674
It's not that hard to get this
to not look like a hotel anymore.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.718
It only looks like a hotel

26:34.801 --> 26:37.929
<i>because of the superficial additions
we've put on it.</i>

26:38.179 --> 26:42.559
If I remove those, it becomes anything.

26:42.642 --> 26:44.477
-NARRATOR: <i>Anything?</i>
-Anything.

26:44.561 --> 26:48.481
NARRATOR: <i>Turning that brow upside down,
Joe Rohde was on board,</i>

26:48.565 --> 26:50.734
<i>-only slightly reluctantly.</i>
-(muttering)

26:50.817 --> 26:52.527
And so, we literally sat down and said...

26:52.611 --> 26:55.071
"Okay, what could Tower
of Terror be?" Well...

26:55.155 --> 26:56.489
There's not a lot of time.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.408
We don't have a lot of time
to do this job.

26:58.491 --> 26:59.993
Let's try to make the job easy.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.828
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, a little bit of good timing</i>

27:01.911 --> 27:04.497
<i>would at least
make their decision-making easier.</i>

27:04.581 --> 27:06.333
Fortunately for us,
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

27:06.416 --> 27:09.502
<i>was coming out with a second film,
and, actually, we both liked the movie.</i>

27:09.586 --> 27:13.632
Because I like the irreverent,
self-referential,

27:13.715 --> 27:18.386
let's have fun with the form.
That is fertile. That's gonna pay off.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.764
And then things cascade very rapidly.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.766
And then it is kind of like an epiphany.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.435
JOE: <i>Where you look at the building,</i>

27:25.518 --> 27:28.605
and suddenly,
you can see through the building

27:28.688 --> 27:31.483
<i>to the bones of the building.</i>

27:31.566 --> 27:35.654
Like, "Oh, it could be like
some kind of fortress."

27:35.737 --> 27:38.198
<i>And if it was a fortress,
who has a fortress?</i>

27:38.281 --> 27:42.494
NARRATOR: <i>Well, this character,
the Collector, played by Benicio del Toro,</i>

27:42.577 --> 27:44.746
<i>-he has a fortress.</i>
-That could be interesting.

27:44.829 --> 27:48.416
NARRATOR: <i>With the deadline looming,
things seemed to be clicking into place.</i>

27:48.500 --> 27:49.918
-Click, click, click.
-(finger snaps)

27:50.001 --> 27:53.296
NARRATOR: <i>See? Especially because</i>
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2

27:53.380 --> 27:56.758
<i>was due to hit the big screen
on May 5th, 2017.</i>

27:56.841 --> 27:58.176
<i>Just three weeks before...</i>

27:58.259 --> 27:59.552
-Memorial Day.
<i>-...on May 29.</i>

27:59.636 --> 28:00.720
Are you kidding me?

28:00.804 --> 28:02.847
NARRATOR:
<i>And much like the original attraction,</i>

28:02.931 --> 28:05.392
<i>-filmed elements would be needed.</i>
-Tower Hotel.

28:05.475 --> 28:08.645
<i>But unlike the high-tech
reincarnation of Rod Serling...</i>

28:08.728 --> 28:09.979
Different kind of introduction.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.023
<i>...this time, they didn't need
the fifth dimension.</i>

28:12.107 --> 28:13.650
They were in production...

28:13.733 --> 28:15.652
NARRATOR:
<i>Just a four-hour flight to Atlanta.</i>

28:15.735 --> 28:18.863
Which meant there were cameras
and actors ready.

28:18.947 --> 28:22.992
So we need to storyboard now.
Like now, in the next three weeks.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.787
'Cause when we hit the ground,
we need to know what we're shooting.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.415
-NARRATOR: <i>So, what were you shooting?</i>
-Something, right?

28:28.498 --> 28:29.666
-NARRATOR: <i>Right.</i>
-Okay, let's see

28:29.749 --> 28:31.334
if we can create a premise
that makes sense.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.086
NARRATOR:
<i>And here's what they came up with.</i>

28:33.169 --> 28:34.754
JEANETTE: <i>The Guardians are stuck
in Tivan's fortress.</i>

28:34.838 --> 28:37.340
They're part of the collection,
and Rocket wants to get them out,

28:37.424 --> 28:39.759
so he needs our guests
to come and free them out.

28:39.843 --> 28:42.595
-That's kind of interesting.
-It just worked.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.305
It was like everything fell out of the sky

28:44.389 --> 28:47.225
and it magically worked
because it's funny.

28:47.308 --> 28:48.977
-That is true!
-Well, look at Rocket.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.688
-Rocket's filled with antics, right?
-That is also true!

28:51.771 --> 28:54.524
NARRATOR: <i>Well, ready or not,
it was time for action.</i>

28:54.607 --> 28:58.820
Amy Jupiter called me and told me
that there was this plan

28:58.903 --> 29:00.822
to re-skin the Tower of Terror.

29:00.905 --> 29:03.616
And taking all of the parts and pieces

29:03.700 --> 29:05.952
and reimagining
what you could do with them.

29:06.035 --> 29:07.996
And everybody was really excited
about that.

29:08.079 --> 29:11.458
It was a huge opportunity
to partner with James Gunn

29:11.541 --> 29:13.084
and being able to partner
with the film talent.

29:13.168 --> 29:18.131
They shot the entire thing
with the genlocked cameras all together,

29:18.214 --> 29:23.595
so that later, they could do moves in post
that could mirror the perspective

29:23.678 --> 29:26.222
of where the audience would be sitting.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.474
Cut! Great. Okay!

29:27.557 --> 29:30.852
NARRATOR: <i>But a wrap for the actors
was just the beginning for the Imagineers.</i>

29:30.935 --> 29:33.188
<i>They had a ride mechanism to modify.</i>

29:33.271 --> 29:36.274
We did not have time
to modify the ride mechanism.

29:36.357 --> 29:37.400
NARRATOR: <i>You didn't? So...</i>

29:37.484 --> 29:40.069
So the ride mechanism is exactly the same.

29:40.153 --> 29:41.863
NARRATOR:
<i>So how would it be different, then?</i>

29:42.405 --> 29:44.616
Twilight Zone Tower of Terror

29:44.699 --> 29:49.412
is all aiming at this feeling
of scream-y fear ride.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.915
NARRATOR: <i>Well, why would that not work
for Guardians?</i>

29:51.998 --> 29:54.501
Not appropriate
to <i>Guardians of the Galaxy.</i>

29:54.584 --> 29:56.920
We needed different emotion.
We need laughter.

29:57.003 --> 29:58.755
(laughs)

29:58.838 --> 30:01.591
And we need a gleeful kind of scream.

30:01.674 --> 30:04.511
-(man screams)
-(Rocket laughs)

30:04.594 --> 30:07.222
NARRATOR: <i>Well, if you want to change
a scream from this...</i>

30:07.305 --> 30:10.600
-Boo, drop, horror.
<i>-to this...</i>

30:11.142 --> 30:15.605
We needed to change the physics
of the up-and-down part.

30:15.688 --> 30:19.901
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, changing the physics.
Well, that sure takes us back.</i>

30:19.984 --> 30:22.987
<i>Back to the brilliance
of the original Imagineers</i>

30:23.071 --> 30:24.405
<i>-for the project.</i>
-It goes down.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.283
<i>Who not only changed
the laws of physics, but...</i>

30:27.367 --> 30:28.576
The up-and-down part.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.871
-NARRATOR: <i>If only there was a way...</i>
-Change the physics.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.666
<i>-to find out what they knew...</i>
-I'm an Imagineer.

30:34.749 --> 30:37.710
<i>-and just how they did it...</i>
-I'm an Imagineer.

30:37.794 --> 30:40.380
NARRATOR:
<i>Oh, hang on. Maybe there is a way.</i>

30:40.463 --> 30:45.385
We had to gather together
the original architects and designers

30:45.468 --> 30:47.303
who worked on this thing originally.

30:47.387 --> 30:48.388
That's me.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.223
And we are going to grill them...

30:51.891 --> 30:53.601
like prisoners.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.104
Actually...

30:56.187 --> 30:59.274
What is safe to deal with
in terms of schedule?

30:59.816 --> 31:01.234
How does that thing really work?

31:01.317 --> 31:03.403
NARRATOR: <i>Well, by any means necessary...</i>

31:03.486 --> 31:05.864
-How far can we push it?
<i>-Joe Rohde...</i>

31:05.947 --> 31:07.615
What can be done with that building

31:07.699 --> 31:09.576
-in this amount of time?
<i>-...got answers...</i>

31:10.034 --> 31:12.704
<i>from whoever was left
that he didn't scare off.</i>

31:12.787 --> 31:16.666
NARRATOR: <i>With the physics lecture over,
Professor Rohde wrote the new rules.</i>

31:16.749 --> 31:21.546
We changed the top of the physics
of that arc so you hover more.

31:21.629 --> 31:23.214
Like, the hang time where you're like...

31:23.298 --> 31:25.216
(gasps)
...breathing.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.593
Breathing happens there.

31:26.676 --> 31:31.681
You do, you know, still fall,
but you spend a lot more free fall time.

31:31.764 --> 31:32.849
-Right?
-NARRATOR: <i>Right.</i>

31:32.932 --> 31:33.766
Right?

31:33.850 --> 31:36.936
NARRATOR: <i>This altering
of the existing mechanism resulted</i>

31:37.020 --> 31:39.439
<i>in a wildly different experience.</i>

31:39.522 --> 31:43.860
It was amazing to us, all the things
you could do with the motion.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.737
And then the music would fill it.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.740
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, yes, the music.
It's a big part of the movies.</i>

31:48.823 --> 31:51.868
JEANETTE: <i>When we landed on great music
from</i> Guardians of the Galaxy,

31:51.951 --> 31:54.370
I thought to myself, that's it!
(finger snaps)

31:55.163 --> 31:56.372
I think this could really work

31:56.456 --> 31:58.708
in a way that's never been seen
or done before in any park.

31:58.791 --> 32:02.128
NARRATOR: <i>So, music it is. But what music?</i>

32:02.211 --> 32:03.087
(clatters)

32:03.171 --> 32:05.131
NARRATOR: <i>The soundtrack
to</i> Guardians of the Galaxy

32:05.214 --> 32:08.134
<i>is very important to the storyline, but...</i>

32:08.217 --> 32:12.680
How do you bring music into an attraction
that didn't have music before?

32:12.764 --> 32:15.642
NARRATOR: <i>And how would they choose
just one song?</i>

32:15.725 --> 32:19.270
And some of them were, like,
iconic songs that you were like,

32:19.354 --> 32:21.022
"This is gonna be so great."

32:21.105 --> 32:22.482
NARRATOR: <i>Well, the Imagineers</i>

32:22.565 --> 32:25.109
<i>took this part of their job
very seriously.</i>

32:25.193 --> 32:26.903
So, we would ride at night.

32:29.364 --> 32:32.116
To find something
that really wanted to say...

32:32.200 --> 32:35.828
It's gotta be a certain tempo.
A certain speed.

32:36.704 --> 32:40.917
-Disruption, irreverence, a driving beat.
-It's gotta have a certain feel to it.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.795
And the timing. Like, you know,
you only have a certain amount of time.

32:43.878 --> 32:48.132
NARRATOR: <i>With a certain amount of time
and an infinite amount of music...</i>

32:48.216 --> 32:50.176
AMY: <i>We would ride and ride and ride.</i>

32:50.259 --> 32:53.680
I was screaming bloody murder
the entire time.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.724
We would ride a lot. A lot.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.477
Pass. I think I'm done.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.689
NARRATOR:
<i>With an unhelpfully long shortlist,</i>

33:02.772 --> 33:05.191
<i>the Imagineers and Joe Rohde
began to realize...</i>

33:05.274 --> 33:09.487
I'm might be able to afford
two versions of this show.

33:09.570 --> 33:13.157
NARRATOR: <i>So, two versions of the ride
with two different songs?</i>

33:13.241 --> 33:14.325
I'm not buying it.

33:14.409 --> 33:17.870
NARRATOR: <i>Hmm.
Well, not quite satisfied with just two,</i>

33:17.954 --> 33:20.248
<i>Joe went back and reassessed the budget.</i>

33:20.331 --> 33:21.290
I can afford six.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.792
NARRATOR: <i>So that's what they did.</i>

33:22.875 --> 33:27.588
<i>Six uniquely programmed experiences
for six completely different songs,</i>

33:27.672 --> 33:30.591
<i>randomized so no one knows
which one they'll get.</i>

33:30.758 --> 33:32.885
Each profile,
each of the six different songs

33:32.969 --> 33:34.387
has its own unique profile,

33:34.470 --> 33:36.055
so it's different
every time you get to go on it.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.516
It's randomized, so we don't even know
what you're gonna get

33:38.599 --> 33:39.892
until you actually get on it.

33:39.976 --> 33:42.395
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, soon enough, people did get on it.</i>

33:42.478 --> 33:45.314
We've been looking forward to this moment
for quite a long time.

33:45.398 --> 33:48.818
-NARRATOR: <i>Because on May 27th, 2017,</i>
-Memorial Day.

33:48.901 --> 33:50.236
<i>it finally opened.</i>

33:50.319 --> 33:54.115
ANNOUNCER 3: <i>We now pronounce Pandora:
The World of Avatar open.</i>

33:54.198 --> 33:56.576
NARRATOR:
<i>Oh, yeah. That opened that day, too.</i>

33:57.076 --> 34:00.997
<i>And somehow, Joe even managed to make it
to the grand opening of both.</i>

34:01.080 --> 34:04.792
I hope not to have to repeat
this travel schedule again in my career.

34:04.876 --> 34:08.129
NARRATOR: <i>Well, when Guardians
of the Galaxy, Mission: Breakout!</i>

34:08.212 --> 34:10.173
<i>finally launched directly upwards...</i>

34:10.256 --> 34:13.134
-MAN 3: This is so cool!
<i>-...and downwards,</i>

34:13.217 --> 34:17.138
<i>the Disney California Adventure Park
would never be the same again.</i>

34:17.221 --> 34:18.765
-It was a...
<i>-Well?</i>

34:18.848 --> 34:21.350
-Thankfully, it was a hit.
-NARRATOR: <i>Of course, it was.</i>

34:21.434 --> 34:22.810
<i>In less than a year,</i>

34:22.894 --> 34:25.938
<i>the Imagineers had turned
The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror</i>

34:26.022 --> 34:29.317
<i>into what could well have been
a completely new attraction.</i>

34:29.400 --> 34:30.526
DAVE: <i>And you see it there, it's like,</i>

34:30.610 --> 34:32.779
"Oh, yeah, this was just built.
This is amazing."

34:32.862 --> 34:34.530
NARRATOR:
<i>And when the first guests entered,</i>

34:34.614 --> 34:38.493
<i>any doubts anyone had Guardians
of the Galaxy, Mission: Breakout!</i>

34:38.576 --> 34:40.328
<i>went out the window.</i>

34:40.411 --> 34:41.621
<i>See? There they go.</i>

34:41.704 --> 34:42.914
(screaming)

34:42.997 --> 34:44.207
People really doubted.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.959
Our guests really doubted
that this was gonna be an attraction

34:47.043 --> 34:49.504
-that they wanted to get on.
-Until it opened.

34:49.587 --> 34:51.839
NARRATOR:
<i>And there's a very good reason for that.</i>

34:51.923 --> 34:54.759
Because it's good. It's good.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.719
NARRATOR: <i>Because at the end of the day...</i>

34:56.803 --> 35:00.264
We do these things,
we do them for the guests.

35:00.348 --> 35:03.518
-NARRATOR: <i>And they'll keep doing them.</i>
-Well, hello, boys.

35:03.601 --> 35:05.436
NARRATOR:
<i>In fact,</i> the Guardians of the Galaxy

35:05.520 --> 35:07.939
<i>have become so popular in California</i>

35:08.022 --> 35:11.275
<i>that there are very big plans
for their next big adventure.</i>

35:11.359 --> 35:13.069
<i>This time, in Epcot, Florida.</i>

35:13.152 --> 35:16.405
Guardians: Cosmic Rewind is going
to be one of the biggest attractions

35:16.489 --> 35:17.573
<i>Imagineering has ever done.</i>

35:17.657 --> 35:20.910
NARRATOR: <i>Not to mention Stark Expo
at Hong Kong Disneyland,</i>

35:20.993 --> 35:25.289
<i>and Avengers Campuses
at Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris.</i>

35:25.373 --> 35:27.917
-And really, the sky's the limit.
-NARRATOR: <i>Is it, though?</i>

35:28.000 --> 35:29.460
A hundred ninety-nine feet eleven.

35:29.544 --> 35:30.962
NARRATOR: <i>That's more like it.</i>

35:33.089 --> 35:38.761
<i>In whatever form this attraction takes,
these four towers now stand proudly</i>

35:38.845 --> 35:41.222
<i>in four Disney Parks around the world.</i>

35:41.305 --> 35:44.517
<i>But it was only when Imagineers
took the time to...</i>

35:44.600 --> 35:49.647
See the bones of the building
and what else it could be.

35:49.730 --> 35:53.025
NARRATOR: <i>It became clear that like
many of life's great lessons,</i>

35:53.109 --> 35:56.654
<i>it's what's inside that counts,
especially when it's...</i>

35:56.737 --> 35:59.407
A very large motor
pulling a vehicle up and down.

35:59.490 --> 36:03.119
NARRATOR: <i>And it's the Imagineers who
built this gravity-defying mechanism...</i>

36:03.202 --> 36:04.245
That's me.

36:04.328 --> 36:07.540
<i>...who laid the groundwork
for unlimited storytelling.</i>

36:07.623 --> 36:12.670
You can take the same typewriter
and tell a horror story or a comedy.

36:13.087 --> 36:15.006
The typewriter's just a tool.

36:15.089 --> 36:16.841
It's what you do
with that tool that counts.

36:17.258 --> 36:20.303
NARRATOR:
<i>And this heavy-duty storytelling tool</i>

36:20.386 --> 36:25.975
<i>was not only able to change the rules
of gravity, but also people's lives.</i>

36:26.058 --> 36:30.813
You just do your job,
but it's more than that.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.233
CÉDRIC: <i>That's the most great experience.</i>

36:35.359 --> 36:39.530
When the kids come back,
they give you a hug and give you the gift

36:39.614 --> 36:42.366
that you're not supposed to deserve
because you just do your job.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.244
I could cry for that.

36:46.287 --> 36:52.043
We don't think enough about how important
these projects are to people...

36:52.126 --> 36:53.794
<i>as an Imagineer.</i>

36:53.878 --> 36:56.214
JOE: <i>It's a chance for you
to make something come together</i>

36:56.297 --> 37:01.719
and mean something
and maybe bring meaning to the world.

37:02.678 --> 37:03.638
NARRATOR: <i>Maybe.</i>

37:03.721 --> 37:09.185
<i>However, there is one other theory
about why people like it so much.</i>

37:10.144 --> 37:12.855
<i>Be it The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror</i>

37:12.939 --> 37:16.067
<i>or the Guardians
of the Galaxy, Mission: Breakout!</i>

37:16.150 --> 37:18.694
<i>this attraction is really...</i>

37:18.778 --> 37:20.821
(screaming)

37:20.905 --> 37:26.869
<i>...really, really, really quite fun!</i>

37:26.953 --> 37:28.829
And thanks for choosing
the Hollywood Tower Hotel

37:28.913 --> 37:30.623
for your next vacations.

37:31.374 --> 37:32.917
(people screaming)

37:34.001 --> 37:36.003
(lively music)
