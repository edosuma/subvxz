WEBVTT

00:10.011 --> 00:12.050
No need to rush off.

00:12.114 --> 00:15.114
If I'm not home soon,
I'm in serious trouble.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.320
Ohh.

00:18.875 --> 00:20.320
Ugh.

00:20.555 --> 00:22.199
Blimey.

00:22.797 --> 00:24.766
What did you do to me?

00:24.837 --> 00:27.997
You said the stout was
"a bit strong for a lady", so I...

00:28.280 --> 00:31.359
So you challenged me
to a drinking competition.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.520
Yes!

00:33.560 --> 00:34.999
Ow.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.880
Did I get in a fight?

00:36.920 --> 00:41.240
You hit your head on the beam
when you stood on the table.

00:44.157 --> 00:46.319
Why was I standing on a table?

00:46.524 --> 00:51.080
♪ I can give you the starlight... ♪

00:51.120 --> 00:52.962
Oh, no, no, I didn't.

00:53.014 --> 00:55.133
The whole pub gave you
a standing ovation.

00:55.227 --> 00:56.587
Argh!

01:02.543 --> 01:04.382
Thanks for a great night.

01:14.170 --> 01:15.450
Grace, wait!

01:22.833 --> 01:25.272
Where d'you learn to
hold your drink like that?

01:25.695 --> 01:28.695
My father owns the brewery!

01:32.910 --> 01:34.270
I'm in love.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.274
Where are you all going?

02:00.021 --> 02:01.480
What's happening?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.560
What's happening? Grace! Stay back!

02:03.600 --> 02:06.200
What's happened?
Stay back. It's your father.

02:06.435 --> 02:07.795
Grace!

02:48.368 --> 02:50.248
Adult literacy classes?

02:50.320 --> 02:53.239
I was hoping you could
help spread the word.

02:53.634 --> 02:55.720
Help recruit volunteers.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.440
And the Good Lord provideth.

02:57.480 --> 02:59.839
I know Mrs McCarthy is a bit strict,
but... Strict?!

02:59.840 --> 03:02.040
She helped out
at the primary school last year

03:02.080 --> 03:04.760
and even the headmaster
started wetting the bed.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.000
I assume you've all heard about
the fire at the brewery?

03:08.040 --> 03:11.400
Oh, terrible.
And they have found a body!

03:12.520 --> 03:14.598
Have they identified it?

03:14.624 --> 03:16.303
Gabriel Kane himself!

03:16.331 --> 03:17.770
Sid!

03:18.153 --> 03:19.520
Sidney?!

03:19.560 --> 03:21.320
Where the devil is he off to?

03:21.360 --> 03:23.600
I need to be in Hambleston by 9:30.

03:24.690 --> 03:26.730
Fire investigators are on the way.

03:26.770 --> 03:29.089
In the meantime,
keep the building sealed off.

03:29.122 --> 03:31.842
Should we start
interviewing witnesses, sir?

03:31.897 --> 03:34.136
Talk to the workers still on-site.

03:34.162 --> 03:37.482
Old building like this,
my money's on dodgy wiring.

03:37.508 --> 03:38.587
I'll handle the family.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.279
You two speak to the gentlemen
in the yard, you follow me.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.400
Don't even think about it.
This area is off limits.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.360
I need to see if Grace is all right.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.880
The blonde? She's fine.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.640
Well, as fine as you can be
when your father's just died.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.239
Over there with her husband.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.280
Now, like I said... It's all right.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.760
I'm leaving.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.719
I'm going to go for a walk.
I need to clear my head.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.240
Do you want me to come with you?

04:05.280 --> 04:08.000
No, no, it's fine.
I'll see you back at the house.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.799
Sid! Sid, slow down!

04:25.800 --> 04:28.120
What for? Do you want
to introduce me to your husband?

04:28.160 --> 04:29.760
You won't say anything, will you?

04:31.840 --> 04:34.279
Course not. Cos it was just
a bit of fun, weren't it?

04:34.280 --> 04:37.920
I don't love him.
Our marriage was arranged.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.999
Harry had an inheritance
he was looking to invest, so...

04:41.000 --> 04:42.400
So your dad got a bunch of cash

04:42.440 --> 04:44.639
and your fella got a stake
in the brewery? Lucky them.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.679
Without Harry's money,
the brewery would have gone under.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.720
Dozens of families rely on us
for their livelihoods.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.760
I'm sorry I lied to you.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.440
I'll keep shtoom.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.200
Goodbye, Sid.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.919
Thank you, Miss Kane. Any further
questions, I'll be in touch.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.399
Please do.

05:26.400 --> 05:30.320
If Grace turns up, will you tell her
the Inspector is looking for her?

05:30.360 --> 05:31.520
Certainly.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.400
Why don't I introduce you to
our Head Brewer, Martin Cartwright?

05:36.440 --> 05:38.999
Padre. I should've known.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.080
I'm here to offer
my spiritual guidance

05:41.120 --> 05:43.520
to the family
in their time of grief.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.360
Father.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.240
There are few ale-lovers
in this county

05:53.280 --> 05:56.520
who have not sung
your father's praises.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.760
Drink makes men do foolish things.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.240
I'm sorry, a wicked thing to say.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.999
Gabriel wasn't my father.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.120
My mother married him
after his first wife died.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.760
I visited your mother
when she was ill.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.039
Gabriel was never the same again.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.880
To bury two wives...

06:17.920 --> 06:19.880
Yes, well, we were never close.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.840
Grace was always the golden girl.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.040
I was only ever
the cuckoo in the nest.

06:25.080 --> 06:28.400
I am sure that
that is not the truth.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.480
Any idea how the fire started?

06:34.760 --> 06:39.000
Gabriel was cutting corners,
bringing costs down.

06:39.040 --> 06:42.720
Harry tried to warn him,
but... an accident was inevitable.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.200
That's a lie!

06:45.640 --> 06:47.920
Daddy would never have put
the brewery at risk.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.760
It must've been sabotage.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.800
A rival brewery, perhaps?

06:52.840 --> 06:55.119
Would the police
have thought of that?

06:55.120 --> 06:57.480
I'm sure they are considering
all possibilities.

06:57.520 --> 06:58.680
Well, are they?

07:00.320 --> 07:03.440
My father's dead!
I want to know what happened!

07:04.840 --> 07:07.600
If there is any evidence
of foul play...

07:07.640 --> 07:11.119
Please, Father.
I know what the police are like.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.480
They'll write it off as an accident
to avoid fuss.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.680
Because it probably was an accident!
No!

07:17.400 --> 07:20.239
You have to help us.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.240
Find out who did this.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.520
I'll do what I can.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.440
Bit early, isn't it?

07:34.760 --> 07:35.880
Free country.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.559
Tell me, Sid,
why were you so alarmed

07:41.560 --> 07:43.120
when you heard about the fire?

07:43.160 --> 07:44.400
I like beer.

07:47.240 --> 07:50.280
I met someone last night.
Someone... connected to the brewery.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.639
I was worried about her.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.359
Is she all right?

07:53.360 --> 07:56.160
No, she's not. She's married. Ah.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.519
Forgive me, but you don't normally

07:59.520 --> 08:01.800
take affairs of the heart
so seriously.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.080
She was different.
At least, I thought she was.

08:05.320 --> 08:09.999
He was here last night.
Causing trouble.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.759
Go on.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.479
'Lady F was having
an evening in for once,

08:14.480 --> 08:16.839
'so I thought I'd treat myself to
a couple of jars.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.720
'Anyway, there's this couple
in there

08:18.760 --> 08:20.399
'and he starts getting a bit handy.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.600
'So I slide over and give it
the old, "Sorry I'm late, darling".'

08:23.640 --> 08:27.040
Sorry I'm late, darling. Problem?
'And he says, "Get lost".'

08:27.080 --> 08:28.680
Now why would I want to do that?

08:29.840 --> 08:33.120
'So he tells me again -
"Get... lost".'

08:34.559 --> 08:35.760
Funny story.

08:35.799 --> 08:38.000
'And I think, well, in for a penny,
in for a pound.'

08:38.039 --> 08:41.480
A good friend once told me
about a bloke called Goliath, right?

08:41.520 --> 08:43.480
And the thing about Goliath was...

08:43.520 --> 08:45.559
'So I tell him how pretty
I think he is.'

08:45.560 --> 08:47.520
..he was almost as ugly as you.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.239
'Just as he's about to plant one
on me, Grace says,

08:50.240 --> 08:52.800
"Just go, Owen. Before you
get yourself into trouble."

08:57.760 --> 08:59.320
'So he says,
"You'll regret this".

09:02.920 --> 09:04.240
'And then he leaves.'

09:07.480 --> 09:08.680
Lovely chap.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.320
'And she and I start to
get acquainted.' Grace.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.959
Sidney Carter, friends call me Sid.

09:12.960 --> 09:16.760
Did Grace say
what they were arguing about?

09:16.800 --> 09:19.720
She said it was nothing.
A misunderstanding.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.000
I spoke to her earlier.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.000
She believes someone started
the fire on purpose.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.240
Do you reckon...?

09:34.520 --> 09:36.400
Want to help me find out?

09:36.440 --> 09:39.560
Mr Kane was found sat at his desk.

09:39.600 --> 09:43.080
The firemen believe the blaze
started in the barrel store.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.040
Why didn't he make a run for it?

09:45.080 --> 09:48.280
Perhaps he was overcome by smoke
before he got the chance.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.960
What time did you both leave
yesterday?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.400
6pm on the dot.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.879
The missus was doing
one of her suet puddings.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.119
I was home all night.

09:58.120 --> 10:01.920
Nine... ish.
Gabriel wanted to go over the books.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.320
He often worked late.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.560
Afterwards, he said
he had paperwork to finish,

10:05.600 --> 10:09.320
so I left
and locked the main door behind me.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.000
Where did you go then?

10:11.040 --> 10:13.280
Home. Had a dreadful migraine.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.720
Was asleep by ten at the latest.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.960
You sure you locked the door?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.080
Certain. Why?

10:20.120 --> 10:23.320
Wasn't forced.
The firemen found it unlocked.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.479
Sir.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.120
Fire inspector found it
in the barrel store.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.960
Looks like a lid.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.360
From a petrol can.

10:38.520 --> 10:39.880
Call the station.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.320
Let them know
we'll be here for a while.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.879
How long, sir?

10:43.880 --> 10:47.039
Until we catch the idiot
that started this fire!

10:47.040 --> 10:48.400
Yes, sir.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.320
All right, cut the price.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.920
We need to shift more barrels,
get some cash in.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.680
This is a Kane pub.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.200
You got a cheek coming in 'ere
after what you did.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.680
Want my money or not?

11:10.720 --> 11:13.159
Mug someone's granny?

11:13.160 --> 11:15.079
Something like that.

11:15.080 --> 11:19.080
Now, are you going to let me
drink in peace,

11:19.120 --> 11:22.520
or should I tell the coppers
where you really were last night?

11:39.440 --> 11:40.600
So where is she?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.680
You know Grace.

11:45.720 --> 11:50.880
She's probably... making daisy chains
in a meadow somewhere.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.600
Rolling in the hay, more like.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.280
You were an imbecile to marry her.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.320
We all make mistakes.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.160
You're not jealous?

12:05.680 --> 12:10.080
While I may not have her looks,
I find a little enthusiasm goes

12:10.120 --> 12:13.279
a very long way, don't you think?
Don't.

12:13.280 --> 12:16.439
That's not what you were saying
last week.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.080
You were like a man possessed.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.440
Like I said.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.880
We all make mistakes.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.719
Sorry to keep you, Inspector.
Business to attend to.

12:36.720 --> 12:40.360
How well do you know your workforce?

12:40.400 --> 12:42.960
Inside and out.
Most of them had dads or grandads

12:43.000 --> 12:44.639
who were coopers here before them.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.279
You must get the occasional
"bad apple"?

12:47.280 --> 12:50.119
They play up, they're out.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.320
Any recently?

12:52.360 --> 12:55.160
Well, one, yeah. Owen Brunt.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.119
Mr Fitzgerald found out
he was stealing.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.039
Do you know where I might find him?

12:59.040 --> 13:00.960
Yeah, yeah.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.119
But first...

13:03.120 --> 13:04.960
Before you hear this
from someone else,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.280
you know I said I was
at home all night?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.719
Where were you?

13:08.720 --> 13:11.400
In the spinney at the bottom
of Clutterbuck's Farm.

13:11.440 --> 13:12.840
Let me guess.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.480
Poaching?

13:14.520 --> 13:16.039
It were just a couple of pheasants.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.920
It's a daft old family tradition.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.560
I take my boy once a month
on the full moon.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.999
Home before midnight so the missus
doesn't make a fuss, mind!

13:24.000 --> 13:27.360
I wouldn't have mentioned it, only,
on my way home, I saw something.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.120
Someone, I should say.
Heading into the brewery.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.880
You're a hard woman to track down.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.080
Where were you last night?

13:56.160 --> 13:57.200
Mrs Fitzgerald?

13:58.600 --> 14:02.200
At home. Until about ten.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.879
And then I went to the pub
round the corner.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.080
You went to the pub?

14:07.120 --> 14:08.800
By yourself?

14:08.840 --> 14:13.200
Harry was asleep.
I wanted to get out of the house.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.400
I stayed until closing time.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.879
Then?

14:16.880 --> 14:19.159
I went straight to bed.

14:19.160 --> 14:24.120
You often sneak to the pub
while your husband's sleeping?

14:24.160 --> 14:26.960
No. Not often.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.200
Inspector!

14:31.880 --> 14:33.120
Do you have news?

14:35.120 --> 14:38.920
Martin Cartwright
saw someone going into the brewery

14:38.960 --> 14:40.959
shortly before the fire started.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.840
He said he was at home all night.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.320
Yes, well... that's
a separate matter.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.000
So who was it?

14:49.040 --> 14:50.760
Mrs Fitzgerald.

14:58.680 --> 15:02.160
What exactly are you looking for,
Inspector? Evidence.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.920
That's enough! You can come back
when you've got a warrant.

15:07.960 --> 15:11.719
No. This was my father's house.

15:11.720 --> 15:15.120
Look wherever you like, Inspector.
We've got nothing to hide.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.560
Inspector!

15:24.040 --> 15:25.240
Good work, Sergeant.

15:29.880 --> 15:33.400
Check these items for fingerprints.
Mrs Fitzgerald, you're under arrest.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.239
What? You're not obliged to say
anything unless you wish to do so,

15:36.240 --> 15:39.080
but what you do say will be written
down and may be given in evidence.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.440
I've never seen those things before!
I'm calling our lawyer.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.319
Oi! What do you think you're doing?

15:44.320 --> 15:45.840
Sid, no! Something to say?

15:48.680 --> 15:51.439
You got no proof.
Except the physical evidence

15:51.440 --> 15:54.120
and their head brewer
placing her at the scene.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.920
What's her motive, then?

15:55.960 --> 15:59.000
Money. Arson's always about money.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.719
Probably looking
for an insurance pay-out.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.360
Or maybe she was just
having a bad day.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.639
You've got to help me
clear her name.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.600
I hate to say this, but how do you
know she didn't do it?

16:33.520 --> 16:35.760
You didn't find my fingerprints,
did you?

16:35.800 --> 16:38.719
Because I never touched
any of those things!

16:38.720 --> 16:41.279
Found these in your coat.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.519
Tell me about Owen Brunt.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.720
He used to work for us.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.800
A cooper. Know him well?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.800
Not really.
Well enough to talk to.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.840
I talk to all of our workers.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.920
They are people, not cattle.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.320
So why were you two arguing
last night?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.800
In the pub. You were seen.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.839
Remember you're still under caution.

17:08.640 --> 17:12.119
Owen wanted me to ask my father
for his job back.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.919
I refused.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.800
Owen got angry
and told me we'd regret it.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.400
Know what I think?

17:23.560 --> 17:26.960
You tried to engage
Mr Brunt's services.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
You asked him
to torch the brewery for you.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.800
He said no,
so you went and did it yourself.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.199
That brewery's been in my family
for generations.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.200
So why were you seen going in there?

17:36.240 --> 17:38.960
Get lost on your way home
from the pub?

17:40.360 --> 17:43.480
I wasn't there. Martin's lying.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.040
I don't think so.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.000
Is this it?

17:55.040 --> 17:56.559
I've only just started.

17:56.560 --> 18:00.280
Not everyone's willing to admit
to having literacy problems.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.880
Give me a few days and I'll have
them queuing round the block.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.519
Oh! Father.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.160
What's happened?

18:08.200 --> 18:11.040
Grace Fitzgerald has been
arrested for arson.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.040
Hardly surprising.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.839
Well, a respectable young lady

18:14.840 --> 18:17.520
doesn't go drinking in pubs
on her own.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.519
It wasn't her.

18:19.520 --> 18:23.199
Oh. Well, I suppose
it doesn't make sense,

18:23.200 --> 18:24.840
her jeopardising her inheritance.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.919
Why would Martin Cartwright lie?

18:26.920 --> 18:28.519
Maybe he's in on it.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.959
Or he's covering for someone.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.560
I don't know, but either way,
Grace is innocent.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.600
I wouldn't go that far.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.920
Hello, St Mary's Presbytery.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.560
Yes, yes.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.679
It's for you, Father.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.240
Father Brown speaking.

18:49.680 --> 18:50.720
Now?

18:52.280 --> 18:54.320
Yes, I'll be there presently.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.079
Well?

18:58.080 --> 19:01.600
Grace Fitzgerald
wants to make a confession.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.240
Hah!

19:03.280 --> 19:08.160
Last night I did something
terrible. I can't even say it.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.480
I am notoriously difficult to shock.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.440
I cheated on Harry.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.119
Ah.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.640
What?

19:19.920 --> 19:22.960
You thought I had something to do
with the fire?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.799
No.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.240
It doesn't matter now.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.520
I cannot condone your actions,

19:29.560 --> 19:33.399
but this may be a way out
of your current predicament.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.120
How?

19:35.160 --> 19:37.399
Tell Inspector Mallory
you have an alibi!

19:37.400 --> 19:38.760
I can't!

19:38.800 --> 19:41.400
If I admit to adultery,
Harry will take every penny I have

19:41.440 --> 19:43.440
and throw me out on the street.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.159
He's been foul-tempered enough
recently as it is.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.279
"Foul-tempered"?

19:48.280 --> 19:50.360
He says his migraines
are getting worse,

19:50.400 --> 19:53.040
he's been taking God-knows-what
just to sleep.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.240
And he'd been rowing with Daddy.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.280
What about?

19:59.600 --> 20:02.199
Daddy rejected one of Harry's
business proposals.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.200
Harry didn't take it very well.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.600
Do you know what he was proposing?

20:06.640 --> 20:08.640
I've no idea.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.159
But if you think it'll help,
Daddy probably kept a copy.

20:11.160 --> 20:14.159
He usually ferrets that stuff away
in his safe.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.840
Do you have a key?

20:17.200 --> 20:19.480
Excuse me,
we're right in the middle...

20:19.520 --> 20:21.640
It'll have to wait.
I need to interview Grace again.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.280
Right now?!

20:23.320 --> 20:26.759
According to the doctor
who examined Mr Kane's body,

20:26.760 --> 20:28.920
there's no sign of smoke inhalation.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.600
He was dead before the fire started.

20:31.640 --> 20:35.399
This is now officially
a murder investigation.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.119
Murder?!

20:37.120 --> 20:38.920
But you can't think that I...

20:38.960 --> 20:40.560
That you poisoned your father

20:40.600 --> 20:42.640
then started the fire
to cover it up?

20:43.880 --> 20:46.040
Come with me.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.600
Look for the Holy Grail.

20:52.760 --> 20:53.720
Father.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.520
Gabriel Kane
was dead before the fire.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.719
Inspector Mallory
thinks that Grace poisoned him.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.319
That's ridiculous!

21:02.320 --> 21:06.000
He's got a good case.
Unless we can prove her innocence...

21:06.040 --> 21:08.960
And if we can't,
she's going to hang.

21:10.800 --> 21:15.119
Sergeant! I was wondering
if you could help me.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.720
I'm not allowed to leave my post
at the moment, Your Ladyship.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.480
And I wouldn't dream of asking you.

21:20.520 --> 21:25.400
Actually, um... I'm launching
an adult literacy scheme,

21:25.440 --> 21:28.279
and I was wondering if you could be
my police ambassador.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.520
You must have colleagues
who would benefit from improving

21:31.560 --> 21:33.360
their reading and writing.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.919
Not you, of course.

21:34.920 --> 21:39.440
A fine, intelligent officer
of the law such as yourself.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.680
I'm sure you are highly proficient.

21:41.720 --> 21:46.360
Well... there might be a couple of
the lads that come to mind.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.000
How lovely.

21:48.040 --> 21:52.999
I'm sure you won't mind giving me
their names and contact details.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.400
I assume she didn't mean
the actual Holy Grail.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.720
Well,
it would certainly be a surprise

21:57.760 --> 21:59.960
to the global theological community

22:00.000 --> 22:02.600
if it was found in a brewery
in Kembleford.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.440
So what are we looking for, then?

22:13.200 --> 22:15.800
She couldn't just say
it was in a book?

22:15.840 --> 22:19.040
Probably didn't want Mallory
to hear.

22:38.080 --> 22:42.400
"Miscellaneous, HF, £50."

22:42.440 --> 22:44.240
Anyone there?

22:44.280 --> 22:45.680
Mr Fitzgerald?

22:48.960 --> 22:51.200
Shove this somewhere. Charming.

22:56.840 --> 22:57.840
What's that?

23:01.200 --> 23:03.520
Pentobarbitone.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.000
It's... Ssh.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.280
Now.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.000
Father?

23:15.040 --> 23:16.840
What are you up to?

23:16.880 --> 23:18.199
Grace asked me to see

23:18.200 --> 23:21.200
if I could salvage anything
from her father's office.

23:22.440 --> 23:24.840
Are you sure it was Grace
you saw last night?

23:24.880 --> 23:26.519
Certain.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.120
But you really shouldn't be in here,
Father. It's not safe.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.960
Well, we were just going.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.240
Well?

23:47.280 --> 23:52.280
Harry Fitzgerald wanted Gabriel Kane
to sell the brewery, the land,

23:52.320 --> 23:53.800
and the family name.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.599
Harry killed him
so he couldn't block the sale?

23:58.600 --> 23:59.760
Perhaps.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.640
There is something else.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.559
Gabriel Kane's will?

24:07.560 --> 24:09.560
It doesn't look good.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.719
I wasn't expecting to see you again.

24:24.720 --> 24:27.200
I talked Inspector Mallory round,

24:27.240 --> 24:30.480
after he so rudely interrupted
your confession.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.360
Did you find the key? Yes.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.800
And I have news.

24:38.840 --> 24:42.640
Your father recently altered
his will,

24:42.680 --> 24:46.520
cutting Rose out completely
and naming you as his sole heir.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.960
Poor Rose.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.560
She'll be so disappointed.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.240
Do you think she knew
about the will?

24:54.280 --> 24:56.960
She didn't seem
exactly... grief-stricken

24:57.000 --> 24:58.320
at your father's death.

24:58.360 --> 25:03.360
That's just Rose.
She's getting grumpier by the year.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.200
We used to have such fun.

25:05.240 --> 25:09.480
We'd dress up as each other
and play tricks on Daddy.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.120
But since I got married, she...

25:12.160 --> 25:14.920
She's just changed.

25:14.960 --> 25:18.240
This inheritance will make you
a very wealthy woman.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.199
Grace, this will not look good
to a jury.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.879
But I'd give every penny
to have Daddy back.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.200
You do believe me?

25:27.240 --> 25:31.839
Why do you not tell Inspector
Mallory you have an alibi?

25:31.840 --> 25:34.040
Better to be called an adulteress
than a murderer.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.960
There has to be another way to prove
it wasn't me. What if there isn't?

25:38.160 --> 25:40.400
I can't believe
that you would rather hang

25:40.440 --> 25:44.639
than tell Inspector Mallory
that you were with Sid.

25:44.640 --> 25:49.280
It mustn't come to that. Please.
Harry wouldn't forgive me.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.399
Not for a second time.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.200
A second time.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.720
There was an incident.
With one of the workers.

26:00.280 --> 26:01.480
Owen Brunt?

26:01.520 --> 26:02.760
Yes.

26:04.560 --> 26:07.520
He flirted with me,
he paid me compliments.

26:08.840 --> 26:12.440
Harry was being so cold -
it was in a moment of madness.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.200
He fired Owen on the spot.

26:17.240 --> 26:19.760
Harry told Martin
that Owen took something

26:19.800 --> 26:21.279
that didn't belong to him.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.000
After that, Owen wouldn't let it go.

26:24.040 --> 26:26.160
He followed me around,
begging me to see him.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.680
Last night, he even asked me
to run away with him.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.120
I said no, but he wouldn't listen.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.360
Not until Sid came to my rescue.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.439
Why didn't you tell me this before?

26:36.440 --> 26:40.480
Owen loses his job,
and then you reject him.

26:42.440 --> 26:44.960
This is clear motive for revenge
on the Kane family!

27:00.160 --> 27:01.480
I thought we were in a hurry.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.720
Well, I can't leave without buying
anything, it's against my religion.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.760
Of course,
if you don't want yours...

27:08.120 --> 27:09.720
Right, I've spoken to the landlord -

27:09.760 --> 27:12.160
Owen hasn't been there
since lunchtime.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.400
So you better tell the Inspector.
Tell him what?

27:14.440 --> 27:16.039
That Owen did it!

27:16.040 --> 27:18.359
We don't know that for sure.
Course we do!

27:18.360 --> 27:21.320
Five minutes ago,
you were convinced it was Harry.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.320
And besides, Inspector Mallory,

27:23.360 --> 27:25.440
without evidence,
won't let Grace go.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.439
So?

27:28.440 --> 27:30.640
So we need to know Owen's side
of the story.

27:30.680 --> 27:33.280
Let's go, then.
What about our drinks?

27:41.480 --> 27:45.880
I'm not leaving Grace in that
police cell for another minute.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.240
Feel a bit sick now.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.760
Owen!

28:06.440 --> 28:08.640
Where are you going?
To find another way in.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.120
Wee-hee!

28:26.920 --> 28:28.320
Nah, it's locked.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.599
How did you do that?

28:31.600 --> 28:35.519
You know Inspector Mallory will be
thrilled to arrest us

28:35.520 --> 28:37.280
for breaking and entering?

28:39.360 --> 28:40.920
Oh.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.640
He's going to have bigger problems
than that.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.919
Suicide note.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.800
Says he was paid £50
to start the fire.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.360
By whom? Doesn't say.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.480
"The guilt is too much.

29:05.520 --> 29:08.000
"But what's worse
is knowing she doesn't love me."

29:08.040 --> 29:09.960
My guess is he fell
for Mrs Fitzgerald

29:10.000 --> 29:11.439
and got in over his head.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.599
You going to let her go now?

29:12.600 --> 29:14.479
This doesn't prove
she wasn't involved.

29:14.480 --> 29:17.919
Could've been Grace
who paid him the £50.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.759
The last entry in the Brewery
accounts was for £50-

29:20.760 --> 29:22.520
"miscellaneous expenses."

29:22.560 --> 29:25.239
Initialled HF.
Harry Fitzgerald.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.240
How come you've seen the accounts?

29:27.280 --> 29:31.119
Grace Fitzgerald told me
where to find them.

29:31.120 --> 29:33.960
I've got an eyewitness
that places Grace at the scene!

29:34.000 --> 29:35.920
Your witness is lying.
Or Grace is lying.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.520
Or someone disguised
themselves as Grace.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.160
Five more minutes, Padre,

29:49.200 --> 29:51.439
then I'm abandoning
this ridiculous charade.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.640
Your men are turning
the whole house upside down.

29:53.680 --> 29:55.880
At least tell them
to show a bit of respect!

29:57.320 --> 29:58.920
Are you all right, Father?

29:58.960 --> 30:00.560
Yes.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.400
Migraine.
I suffer from them terribly.

30:05.080 --> 30:08.160
You wouldn't have anything to
take the edge off it, would you?

30:08.200 --> 30:11.079
If it's bad, take one of these.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.360
I'll get you some water.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.840
I found this in Gabriel's study.

30:18.880 --> 30:22.119
Exactly the same. Pentobarbitone.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.879
A bit stronger than your average
migraine medication.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.079
Give me one good reason
not to arrest you

30:27.080 --> 30:30.600
for removing evidence
from the scene of a crime.

30:30.640 --> 30:31.840
The paperwork.

30:31.880 --> 30:33.600
I've found something, sir!

30:38.960 --> 30:40.999
You think I pretended to be Grace?!

30:41.000 --> 30:43.639
You were bitterly jealous
of your sister.

30:43.640 --> 30:47.080
And you certainly know her well
enough to mimic her convincingly.

30:47.120 --> 30:50.920
You have a wonderful imagination,
Inspector! Look at me.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.760
It was dark, remember?

30:56.440 --> 30:57.440
The right clothes.

31:00.440 --> 31:01.880
A wig...

31:04.000 --> 31:05.320
What wig?

31:08.000 --> 31:10.840
We found this
in the back of your wardrobe.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.600
But I haven't seen that thing
for years!

31:15.640 --> 31:18.279
And if I'd already gone
to so much trouble,

31:18.280 --> 31:20.600
why not start the fire myself
while I was there?

31:20.640 --> 31:23.000
Arson's not an easy thing
to get right.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.040
You needed to be sure.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.719
I don't even have a key
to the brewery!

31:27.720 --> 31:28.960
Harry did.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.760
You were desperate
to sell off the brewery,

31:32.800 --> 31:34.000
but Gabriel wouldn't let you.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.840
You think I'd let my own wife hang?

31:36.880 --> 31:37.799
Why not?

31:37.800 --> 31:40.480
With Grace and Gabriel
out of the way,

31:40.520 --> 31:43.120
you could do what you liked
with the brewery.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.880
You two plotted to kill Gabriel
and frame Grace,

31:45.920 --> 31:48.039
using Owen to start the fire.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.400
Piffle!

31:49.440 --> 31:51.960
Do you deny paying Owen the £50?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.880
No, but I didn't...

31:53.920 --> 31:57.560
I gave him that money
to keep his mouth shut

31:57.600 --> 31:59.760
about his thing with Grace.

31:59.800 --> 32:02.120
I didn't want the world
to know I'm a cuckold!

32:04.280 --> 32:07.359
We found this on the scene.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.800
Pentobarbitone.

32:10.240 --> 32:14.040
And from your personal supply.

32:15.640 --> 32:16.960
A perfect match.

32:18.520 --> 32:22.279
Just like you two.
You're both under arrest for murder.

32:22.280 --> 32:25.799
This is ridiculous.
No, you're wrong!

32:25.800 --> 32:27.200
You've got it wrong!

32:32.720 --> 32:33.960
Ah! Joseph.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.760
Good morning, Inspector.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.640
Thank you for coming.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.559
Wanted to pay my respects
to Mr Kane.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.080
How are Harry and Rose?

32:46.120 --> 32:49.039
Stubborn. Denying everything.

32:49.040 --> 32:52.159
Fitzgerald's hired
an army of lawyers.

32:52.160 --> 32:54.240
You mean they're pleading
not guilty?

32:54.280 --> 32:56.719
For all the good it'll do.
Must've thought the fire

32:56.720 --> 32:59.360
would cover their tracks,
but they were too careless.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.240
Grace.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.160
How've you been?

33:09.200 --> 33:10.440
You know.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.560
Thanks again. For helping me.

33:14.600 --> 33:17.080
I don't deserve it,
the way I treated you.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.839
That's not true.

33:18.840 --> 33:21.399
Listen, I've been thinking.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.880
Now Harry's gone... Oh, Sid.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.720
I'm leaving.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.320
Too many bad memories.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.160
Please stay.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.440
I can't. I'm going to America.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.320
America?!

33:36.520 --> 33:37.719
When?

33:37.720 --> 33:39.120
I leave this afternoon.

33:40.880 --> 33:41.800
But...

33:44.320 --> 33:46.360
I'll never forget
the night we had together.

33:59.880 --> 34:02.080
Would you like to say a few words?

34:02.120 --> 34:04.319
Would it be awful if I didn't?

34:04.320 --> 34:06.520
I don't think
I can get the words out.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.800
I think everyone will understand.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.679
You're so kind.

34:17.560 --> 34:18.960
Ah, Sid.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.400
The one that got away.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.080
He will be missed.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.480
Almost as much as his brewery.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.559
Arrived this morning
from Mrs Fitzgerald.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.438
We're all out of a job.

34:47.440 --> 34:49.800
They're tearing the place down.

34:49.840 --> 34:50.920
Grace is selling up?

34:52.679 --> 34:54.280
Gabriel will be spinning down there.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.719
I'm sorry.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.200
What'll I do now?

35:01.640 --> 35:04.879
If there's anything I can do
to help, you know where I am.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.360
Thanks, Father.

35:10.960 --> 35:13.080
What's happening with
Owen Brunt's funeral?

35:13.120 --> 35:15.280
It's at St Augustine's in Knapton
this afternoon.

35:15.320 --> 35:16.640
He has family there.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.879
A church burial, after what he did?

35:18.880 --> 35:21.359
I believe discretion is being used

35:21.360 --> 35:23.920
as to the exact circumstances
of his death.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.560
I'll ask Sid to take me.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.560
I'd like to pay my respects.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.200
I didn't know you were acquainted.
Well, we weren't, really.

35:30.240 --> 35:33.119
He was one of the few to sign up
to my literacy scheme.

35:33.120 --> 35:36.200
Poor man had just lost his job,
and could hardly write his own name.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.440
Such a waste.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.719
Mr Cartwright,
the letter you got today.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.239
May I have a look?

35:42.240 --> 35:43.600
Certainly, Father.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.640
Sid!

35:51.680 --> 35:54.279
Can you ask Inspector Mallory
to meet me at the brewery?

35:54.280 --> 35:55.600
There's been another murder!

36:09.640 --> 36:12.559
Are you really prepared
to let Harry and Rose be punished

36:12.560 --> 36:13.680
for something you did?

36:15.160 --> 36:16.240
I don't understand.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.880
The redundancy notices you sent.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.120
Handwriting matches
Owen's suicide note.

36:29.160 --> 36:32.960
Even an amateur graphologist
would notice the similarities.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.640
Perhaps he had the same teacher
as a boy.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.519
Owen was illiterate.

36:39.520 --> 36:41.760
He didn't kill himself.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.760
You shot him.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.879
That's quite a leap.

36:46.880 --> 36:50.840
Your alibi was,
by his own admission, drunk.

36:52.320 --> 36:55.760
Simple matter for you to wait
until he went to sleep,

36:55.800 --> 36:57.760
and then slip away.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.400
You drugged your father...

37:01.800 --> 37:04.920
..and then lit a fire
to cover your tracks.

37:08.960 --> 37:13.040
With Gabriel dead and Harry framed
for his murder,

37:13.080 --> 37:15.079
you were free to sell the brewery

37:15.080 --> 37:19.879
and start up again
as a rich independent woman.

37:19.880 --> 37:23.239
And you let yourself be caught
with Owen in flagrante delicto

37:23.240 --> 37:25.400
because you knew full well

37:25.440 --> 37:29.479
that Harry would pay
to have the scandal covered up.

37:29.480 --> 37:32.320
Then you faked Owen's suicide
and left a note

37:32.360 --> 37:34.960
that would help to frame Harry,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.040
and prove your innocence.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.639
And Rose?

37:39.640 --> 37:41.679
Why would I get her involved?

37:41.680 --> 37:45.560
Ah. The wicked stepsister.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.800
How long did it take you
to convince your father

37:49.840 --> 37:51.360
to cut her out of the will?

37:52.760 --> 37:54.200
No idea what you mean.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.919
I'm confused.

37:58.920 --> 38:02.960
If I went to such efforts
to get myself an alibi,

38:03.000 --> 38:06.440
why didn't I tell Mallory
as soon as he arrested me?

38:06.480 --> 38:11.200
You wanted ME to investigate.
That's why you seduced Sid.

38:11.240 --> 38:12.999
You knew we were friends,

38:13.000 --> 38:17.440
and you didn't trust the police
to find your little clues.

38:18.480 --> 38:21.279
You can't truly believe
I framed myself.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.760
Hid evidence in my own car.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.320
Mallory was right.

38:25.360 --> 38:29.239
The culprit was too careless -
dropping the medicine bottle

38:29.240 --> 38:32.799
AND the lid to the petrol can,
AND being seen by a witness.

38:32.800 --> 38:36.640
Unless... it was deliberate.

38:38.240 --> 38:41.160
How could I have known I'd be seen?

38:41.200 --> 38:42.960
Full moon.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.960
You've known Martin all your life.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.679
You knew he'd be poaching.

38:47.680 --> 38:51.280
All you had to do was wait
by the brewery until he appeared.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
Even if what you're saying
were true...

38:57.640 --> 38:59.080
..why should I be sorry?

39:01.720 --> 39:07.920
My father was a cruel bully who sold
me off without a second thought.

39:08.840 --> 39:14.800
Harry is a weakling,
addicted to those painkillers.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.720
I've always hated
that stinking brewery,

39:17.760 --> 39:20.360
and now I'll be free of it.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.639
Forever.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.200
And Owen Brunt?

39:25.720 --> 39:29.720
When I broke things off with him,
he threatened to tell my father.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.760
Now, I don't respond well
to threats.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.079
Anyway, it was suicide -
didn't you hear?

39:38.080 --> 39:39.280
Grace.

39:39.320 --> 39:41.319
Please.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.720
Confess and turn yourself in.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.800
It's not too late
to seek God's forgiveness.

39:49.040 --> 39:52.880
I'm sorry, Father,
but God will have to wait.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.960
I have a train to catch.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.159
What's this about another murder?

40:19.160 --> 40:22.720
Owen Brunt. It wasn't suicide.

40:22.760 --> 40:23.760
Her?

40:27.240 --> 40:28.520
Mrs Fitzgerald!

40:30.920 --> 40:33.120
You're only delaying the inevitable!

40:38.080 --> 40:40.479
Grace!

40:40.480 --> 40:43.640
Please, let me help.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.080
Inspector! She's up here!

40:49.400 --> 40:51.760
Mrs Fitzgerald. Get back here!

40:59.320 --> 41:00.880
Wouldn't if I were you.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.440
Get off me!

41:05.560 --> 41:06.600
Grab her!

41:08.480 --> 41:10.479
Don't move!

41:10.480 --> 41:11.720
You're under arrest!

41:16.800 --> 41:19.000
Oh!

41:19.040 --> 41:23.439
Help me! This is a terrible mistake.
Stop her!

41:23.440 --> 41:24.880
We can run away together!

41:26.040 --> 41:27.280
Come on, then.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.759
What are you doing?

41:32.760 --> 41:34.440
What...

41:34.480 --> 41:38.120
Idiot!
Now, now, no need to be bitter.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.440
Grace Fitzgerald,
you're under arrest for murder.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.479
Should've known
it was too good to be true

41:58.480 --> 42:00.400
when she said her father
owned a brewery.

42:00.440 --> 42:01.960
All that glisters is not gold.

42:06.280 --> 42:09.599
I just wanted to say thank you
for helping to clear our name.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.200
To be fair, if it weren't for him,

42:11.240 --> 42:13.999
you wouldn't have been in the frame
in the first place.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.079
Thanks for that, Sid. Pleasure.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.239
I've halted the sale of the brewery.

42:18.240 --> 42:21.159
I thought you wanted to sell up?

42:21.160 --> 42:23.200
I've had a change of heart.

42:23.240 --> 42:27.560
We'll have to modernise, but there's
still one Kane to keep things going.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.520
I must say I am delighted.

42:39.240 --> 42:40.480
Well, that was awkward.

42:40.520 --> 42:42.080
I imagine it was.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.480
You slept with his wife.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.280
Fair point.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.560

I've learnt a valuable lesson.

42:51.080 --> 42:52.399
Which is?

42:52.400 --> 42:55.160

42:56.887 --> 42:58.487

43:00.167 --> 43:01.647
To the one that got away.

43:02.946 --> 43:05.280
To the one that NEARLY got away.
