WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:02.768
- It's from my mom.

00:02.837 --> 00:05.137
I didn't know she and my
stepdad were getting married.

00:05.139 --> 00:06.238
She blames me for darius.

00:06.307 --> 00:08.006
(gasps)
- been having a lot of pain

00:08.075 --> 00:09.908
And I forgot to refill
my prescription.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.510
Do you think you could
write me a new one?

00:11.579 --> 00:13.645
- Yeah.
- I've done well in my life.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.447
And I haven't had anyone
to share it with.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.248
- If you feel like you need
to offer me money

00:17.284 --> 00:19.318
So I'll give you my kidney--
- I didn't come here

00:19.320 --> 00:20.285
To get anything from you.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.021
- Hey, you okay?

00:23.090 --> 00:24.523
- No, I think
my relationship's over.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.790
- I'm sorry.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.696
- Sick trampoline.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.832
- The kids have been waiting
weeks for it to get here

00:33.967 --> 00:35.567
So if we don't
put it up tonight,

00:35.702 --> 00:38.904
They'll be bugging me for days.
- I thought it was date night.

00:38.906 --> 00:40.739
I shaved my legs and everything.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.075
- I want to get this done
now while they're at my mom's.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.610
Out of the way!

00:44.745 --> 00:47.412
- Okay, but we're home alone
on date night

00:47.481 --> 00:50.749
So maybe we should
try this thing out.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.684
For safety.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.288
- If I make this,
it's over for you.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.090
- Oh, yeah? Good luck.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.092
- And I want the goods. Undies!

01:00.094 --> 01:02.994
(laughing)
that counts!

01:03.030 --> 01:05.097
(laughing)

01:08.002 --> 01:11.003
I won strip-trampoline.
I won.

01:11.138 --> 01:13.105
- Hang on.
I still got socks on.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.507
(laughing)

01:16.744 --> 01:18.710
(grunts)

01:18.746 --> 01:20.078
(gasps)

01:20.081 --> 01:22.447
That counts!
(laughing)

01:22.483 --> 01:25.250
(grunting)

01:25.319 --> 01:26.985
Babe, I'm stuck.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.319
Babe?

01:28.355 --> 01:29.922
- Birch wing air?

01:29.924 --> 01:31.790
- It's still just a startup,

01:31.859 --> 01:34.059
But I wouldn't be the only
female pilot there.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.461
- So you want to
go somewhere else?

01:36.464 --> 01:38.397
- I want to go
where I feel valued.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.799
Where I can climb the ladder
because I'm good at my job.

01:41.836 --> 01:43.802
After what happened
with wheezer,

01:43.804 --> 01:45.804
I'm not sure I can do that here.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.607
- But that wasn't your fault.
- Yeah, he's the chief pilot.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.876
He makes all the staffing
decisions.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.877
After I turned down
a captain cargo spot,

01:52.913 --> 01:54.412
I don't think he'll consider me

01:54.414 --> 01:56.081
For a left seat
if it opens up again.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.016
What if he thinks
that I don't want it,

01:58.085 --> 02:00.185
Or that I can't handle it?

02:00.321 --> 02:02.621
I don't want to leave, but...

02:02.690 --> 02:04.623
If I can't advance here...

02:05.726 --> 02:08.627
You think I'm wrong?
You have that face.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.229
- I guess I just...

02:10.364 --> 02:12.297
I wish you hadn't let me
get attached.

02:12.432 --> 02:15.634
I mean, I just moved here,
we just met.

02:15.703 --> 02:18.637
But you know,
if I knew you weren't staying...

02:18.639 --> 02:21.239
- What? You wouldn't
have bothered?

02:21.275 --> 02:23.375
- What? Lex, no.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.043
(beeping)

02:25.045 --> 02:26.578
Damn, um...

02:27.414 --> 02:29.047
Look, can we catch up later?

02:35.222 --> 02:38.056
- You must think
we're ridiculous!

02:38.092 --> 02:39.391
- Hey, believe it or not,

02:39.393 --> 02:40.792
This is not the worst scene
I've been to.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.328
- It was totally worth it!
You landed that flip!

02:43.397 --> 02:45.863
- Uh, you think
we should maybe, um...

02:45.900 --> 02:48.066
You know...
- Oh, um, yeah!

02:48.102 --> 02:49.801
We should probably
keep the patient warm

02:49.837 --> 02:53.004
So he doesn't go into shock.
- He's a maniac.

02:53.073 --> 02:54.873
But he means well.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.141
We've been together eight years.

02:57.178 --> 03:01.346
And somehow,
he still finds a way
to make everything fun.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.949
- Let's get that sidearm back
on the saddle, okay, cowboy?

03:03.951 --> 03:06.818
- Sometimes I get too serious.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.421
Too worried about the future.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.257
Not dave.
- Must be nice.

03:12.259 --> 03:13.759
To not worry about
what's coming next.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.295
- Okay. On three, ready?

03:16.430 --> 03:18.063
- Hey, you watching, ali?

03:18.198 --> 03:19.898
(gasping)
- ali?

03:19.967 --> 03:21.666
Oh. Ali!

03:22.603 --> 03:24.035
Decreased lung sounds,
right side.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.238
She's got a closed pneumo,
she needs a decompression.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.939
- What is it?
Is she okay?

03:28.008 --> 03:29.807
- Hang in there, hang in there,
you're alright, ali.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.776
- Get me out of here.
I need to help her!

03:31.845 --> 03:34.713
- You're gonna be okay.
Just a second. Almost there.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.581
- One, two...

03:36.584 --> 03:37.749
(gasp)

03:39.152 --> 03:41.152
(grunting)

03:42.156 --> 03:43.589
Here you go.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.124
Oh, yeah. These things
are hours of fun.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.793
(opening theme)

03:56.070 --> 04:00.438
- Dispatch 933, we've just
dropped off a patient
and medic in kenora,

04:00.440 --> 04:01.873
Returning to base.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.276
<i> - Skymed 933, dispatch.</i>

04:04.411 --> 04:07.211
<i> You are good to return</i>
<i> and stand by at yth.</i>

04:08.415 --> 04:10.816
- You know if you properly
execute a barrel roll,

04:10.818 --> 04:13.285
You pull exactly 1g throughout.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.487
You could pour a glass of water
the whole time.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.089
- You must've pulled a g
in training exercises
at selection camp.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.557
- Yeah, yeah, we did.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.959
My buddy jake,
he made the final 16,

04:21.996 --> 04:23.561
Calls me this morning.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.864
Gosh, the stuff
they do there, man. Woo!

04:28.102 --> 04:30.569
I mean, when I got back
from camp, the way it ended,

04:30.704 --> 04:33.905
I... I don't know,
I thought boring was good.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.707
Meant everything was going
to be safe, but...

04:36.977 --> 04:38.710
I don't know, dude,
I just...

04:38.746 --> 04:40.912
I'm just bored now.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.315
Like, what am I even
working towards?

04:43.317 --> 04:46.051
- Yeah, yeah, I feel you.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.520
I love flying, but lately,

04:48.522 --> 04:51.756
It's been more about
paying the bills.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.264
- Should we roll it?

05:02.369 --> 05:05.069
Oh, c'mon, dude!
We can totally aileron
roll this thing.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.205
Besides, that naked trampoline
guy was right!

05:07.207 --> 05:09.007
You do something long enough,
you got to find ways

05:09.142 --> 05:10.942
To keep the fun alive, baby!

05:11.011 --> 05:12.944
- Chops, it's against regs.
- C'mon, dude.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.579
You know we can do this.

05:14.615 --> 05:18.149
Besides, how often are we
empty in the air

05:18.185 --> 05:22.554
Without a patient
or a medic? Huh?

05:23.490 --> 05:24.890
C'mon.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.557
Huh?

05:27.795 --> 05:28.960
Yeah!

05:30.297 --> 05:34.565
- I guess it is within
the aircraft's capabilities.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.168
- Yes! Let's go, let's go!

05:36.303 --> 05:38.036
Okay, ready?
- I'm filming this one.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.904
- Yes, yes you are.
- You're crazy, by the way.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.173
- I am not.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.040
That is a compliment,
by the way. Okay, ready?

05:43.811 --> 05:47.045
Three, two, one.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.647
(engine exerting)

05:48.782 --> 05:51.115
(screams of excitement)

05:59.460 --> 06:01.460
(laughing)

06:02.930 --> 06:04.596
- That was good, man.
That was good.

06:04.731 --> 06:07.265
- Hey. Austin.
- Kingsley.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.499
What are you doing here?

06:09.403 --> 06:11.302
I brought a couple things
for joel.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.206
Madison said that he's in
crawlers now so...

06:15.242 --> 06:18.209
- Madison told you I got
fired from the whiskey hatch?

06:18.245 --> 06:20.879
I'm looking for a second job,
I can take care of my family.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.880
- I know that, austin.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.950
I just wanted to bring
a few things for my grandson.
That's all.

06:26.019 --> 06:30.555
Look, I own a couple
grocery stores in mississauga.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.892
So when I came up here and saw
how expensive everything is,

06:33.961 --> 06:37.429
I called my staff and asked
them to send over a few things.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.566
I hope I didn't overstep.

06:41.701 --> 06:44.903
I just want a chance to take
care of my family, too.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.373
(sighing)

06:48.442 --> 06:49.908
- Thanks.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.143
Um...

06:52.980 --> 06:54.913
Madison wanted to invite you

06:54.982 --> 06:56.781
To a play date at the park
this weekend.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.917
Since the weather's
getting warmer...

06:59.052 --> 07:00.585
- I'll be there.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.996
- Your dad seems nice.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.670
- It gets worse the more
north you go.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.406
A bag of potatoes that costs
$5 in winnipeg,

07:21.541 --> 07:23.007
Costs $20 here.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.710
And 60 by the time
it reaches deep lake.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.079
- Not a lot of cargo companies
want to ship perishables.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.148
The ones that do
charge a premium.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.417
- But we can ship trampolines.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.386
- People need
to have fun, too, bodes.

07:35.422 --> 07:38.022
- Or, trampolines
make more money.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.560
- Yeah, well... C'mon.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.297
<i> - You all know how this works,</i>
<i> let's go!</i>

07:45.432 --> 07:48.299
42-year-old male presenting
with possible kidney stones.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.435
- Urinalysis, bloodwork,
abdominal x-ray.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.504
- 6-year-old male
with convulsions,

07:52.506 --> 07:53.972
Loss of consciousness,
incontinence.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.773
- Possible epilepsy,
head injury, fever,

07:55.843 --> 07:57.509
Poisoning, congenital condition.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.778
- 65-year-old woman,
complaints of fatigue,
frequent nosebleeds,

08:00.814 --> 08:03.081
Heavy bruising.
- Blood analysis for...

08:03.150 --> 08:04.382
Kookum?

08:04.451 --> 08:06.918
- I didn't complain of anything.
It was this one.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.192
- I knew it was weird when
I caught you napping
the other day.

08:15.229 --> 08:16.928
Why didn't you tell me
you weren't feeling well?

08:16.930 --> 08:19.130
- Because I have it
under control.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.466
My teas work just fine.

08:21.601 --> 08:24.169
I certainly don't need
all this garbage.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.204
- I brought some fish
to her house this morning,

08:26.206 --> 08:27.739
She was having a nosebleed,

08:27.808 --> 08:30.509
She said everything was fine,
but she was pale, sob--

08:30.644 --> 08:34.212
- He said if I came in,
you'd give me enema kits
for buttercup's ears.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.680
- I might have said that.

08:36.550 --> 08:37.949
- If I give you one of these,

08:38.018 --> 08:39.450
Will you let me take some blood?

08:43.990 --> 08:46.090
- You're not wearing
the earrings I made you.

08:46.126 --> 08:49.660
- I was, kookum,
but they just kept getting
caught in my lab coat.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.631
- Ms. Daniels?
- Mm-hmm.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.099
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.634
I wanted to finish
with my other students

08:56.703 --> 08:58.336
Before I came in and said hello.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.338
- Well, hello.
- It means so much to us

09:00.473 --> 09:04.843
At tch to have one
of our first-years having
a paper published.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.379
I printed one off for you.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.714
It's going to be a while
before it comes out.

09:09.849 --> 09:11.249
I just thought maybe
you'd like to read it.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.118
- Guess we're both
full of surprises.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.758
(indistinct chatter)

09:20.827 --> 09:22.527
- Ah, look who made it!

09:22.662 --> 09:25.129
(laughter)
- hey tony!

09:25.165 --> 09:27.198
- And you must be milosz?

09:27.267 --> 09:29.367
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Ah, we're family.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.470
Michelle, look who's here!

09:32.539 --> 09:35.139
Your handsome,
strapping young son!

09:35.208 --> 09:38.075
(chuckling)
- you came?

09:39.313 --> 09:43.148
I wasn't sure you would.
- Hey, mom. Congratulations.

09:43.283 --> 09:47.619
- And look who he brought with
him, top gun like tom cruise!

09:47.754 --> 09:49.888
(laughing)

09:49.890 --> 09:52.189
- Thank you for having me.
- Oh.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.496
- Excuse me.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.197
Tristan, young man.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.835
Listen, I know your mother
won't have said,

10:04.871 --> 10:08.907
But I think it would mean a lot
if you would say a few words.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.776
- You want me to give a speech?

10:11.911 --> 10:13.511
- Of course, you're her son!
Who else?

10:18.685 --> 10:21.218
We... We put it up last year.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.922
It was time.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.564
- I read your paper.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.065
I was confused.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.934
- Yeah, it can't be
a little... Jargon-y.

10:36.936 --> 10:40.204
- Pfft. I know my<i> nôsisim</i>
is very smart.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.408
Of course, you figured out
what no one else did.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.010
(in nêhiyawêwin)

10:46.079 --> 10:49.013
(in english): But why didn't it
say you knew about angel's glow

10:49.082 --> 10:52.217
From your dad's stories
about your ancestors
in the civil war?

10:52.352 --> 10:54.152
- It's an academic paper.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.354
Information needs to be
cited in a specific way.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.823
- But this isn't
your knowledge, crystal.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.226
(in nêhiyawêwin)

11:01.361 --> 11:03.194
(in english): Well,
med school's just like that.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.631
There's all these rules
about what you can say
and how you can act.

11:06.766 --> 11:10.969
You have to play their game,
their way, to succeed.

11:10.971 --> 11:14.872
- But what are you
succeeding at if you're just
doing what they want?

11:17.077 --> 11:19.577
- Your blood work came back.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.379
- So I can go home?

11:21.514 --> 11:24.315
- Not yet. Your white
blood count is high

11:24.317 --> 11:26.918
And they found blast cells.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.720
You'll need
a bone marrow biopsy.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.055
I know that sounds scary,
but it doesn't hurt.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.391
(in nêhiyawêwin)

11:33.526 --> 11:36.427
(in english): I'll smudge first.
- We can't smudge in here.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.263
It's a ventilation issue,
the hospital doesn't allow it.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.867
(in nêhiyawêwin)

11:42.869 --> 11:46.004
(in english): Have the biopsy,
this could be something serious.

11:46.139 --> 11:49.306
- Fine, I'll smudge
when I leave.

11:51.978 --> 11:54.279
(indistinct chatter)

11:54.281 --> 11:57.015
- Greens are a stubborn
bunch, eh?

11:57.150 --> 12:00.485
Michelle needs her heart pills.

12:00.554 --> 12:03.054
Her bladder keeps her up
at night.

12:03.189 --> 12:05.824
I should crush them
and put them in her tea, eh?

12:05.826 --> 12:07.425
(chuckling)

12:07.560 --> 12:10.427
So maverick, you're a pilot?

12:10.464 --> 12:12.697
Your parents must be proud.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.500
- Well, they escaped
communist poland

12:15.502 --> 12:19.237
To give my older brother and I
a better life so... No.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.973
They're disappointed
that I'm not doing something

12:22.042 --> 12:23.975
More stable with better pay.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.110
- And what does your brother do?

12:26.146 --> 12:28.112
- Anything and everything
to show me up.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.881
- Ha! I'll be proud of you
for them, then.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.987
- You should be proud
of tristan.

12:36.056 --> 12:39.857
He's a great nurse.
He's a good person.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.659
- You think
we're not proud of him?

12:43.330 --> 12:47.331
It's why he never comes home?
- I should bring him...

12:52.472 --> 12:55.940
Tris, I got you one of those
coconut tarts you like.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.276
- Why did anthony ask me
to write a speech?

12:58.278 --> 13:00.711
I don't know what to say
and she doesn't want
to hear from me anyway.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.280
- Anthony thinks she does.
- He doesn't know

13:02.415 --> 13:03.681
What it's like
after darius died.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.149
When my mom met anthony

13:05.185 --> 13:07.351
A couple of years after,
she came back to life,

13:07.387 --> 13:10.221
Except with me. She just...

13:11.825 --> 13:13.691
She just stopped
trusting me, nowak.

13:13.693 --> 13:17.328
No matter what I do,
she just... Won't...

13:18.832 --> 13:22.700
- Just... Speak from
your heart, tris.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.103
Even if it doesn't
change anything.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.005
Even if she doesn't forgive you.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.643
Just say what you need to say.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.180
- I'm glad you're here.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.381
I don't think I could've done
this without you.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.865
- Oh, I'm dying.
Oh, oh yeah.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.267
Definitely dying.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.470
- I know that climbing
in and out

13:59.506 --> 14:01.939
Of those tiny cockpits,
you've got to cat-cow.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.808
(door closing)
no wonder your back's acting up.

14:04.845 --> 14:08.746
- Ooh. You're going to need
some coconut water.

14:08.782 --> 14:10.547
Good thing I grabbed some
at the grocery store in winnipeg

14:10.584 --> 14:12.083
After I dropped my patient off.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.751
- Is that an actual bounce
in your step?

14:13.753 --> 14:15.786
- Sure! Spring has sprung,

14:15.822 --> 14:17.555
I slept seven hours
straight last night.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.957
And I was able to find
rhubarb in winnipeg.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.226
- It's the devil's celery.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.862
Whoa!
(laughing)

14:24.898 --> 14:26.898
- Somebody's got spring fever.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.799
Better get that back
fixed up, champ.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.401
(chuckling)

14:30.437 --> 14:32.837
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.740
He knows?
- Yeah...

14:35.742 --> 14:37.975
I might have... I might have
let it slip at the drag club.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.444
- Oh, okay, that's, um...

14:40.480 --> 14:44.115
That's cool. I just, I thought
maybe we would talk about it
before we told people.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.350
- I didn't tell people.
I told reese.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.787
And tristan. But it's fine!
They're not gonna tell anybody.

14:50.957 --> 14:53.258
- Have you lived
in a crew house before?

14:54.261 --> 14:57.061
(sighing)
coconut water and rhubarb,

14:57.196 --> 14:59.397
We have very different
ideas of happiness.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.066
- I just feel like
after everything that's
happened this past year,

15:02.068 --> 15:04.468
I finally got everything
under control.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.970
You know?

15:07.073 --> 15:09.140
And maybe I have a little bit
of spring fever.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.408
(whipping)
(screams)

15:10.477 --> 15:12.543
(grunting)

15:12.545 --> 15:14.212
- Will you help an old man up?

15:14.214 --> 15:16.046
(laughing)

15:20.453 --> 15:23.954
This is a lot better than yoga,
way more my speed.

15:26.559 --> 15:29.326
(heavy breathing)

15:31.030 --> 15:32.297
(gasps)

15:37.904 --> 15:39.904
(pills rattling)

15:47.714 --> 15:49.380
- Hayley?

15:51.051 --> 15:52.416
What the hell is this?

15:55.956 --> 15:57.722
- You're overreacting.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.857
I've had a lot of pain
since my surgery,

15:59.893 --> 16:01.793
But, you know, I'm managing.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.661
- It is a long walk
from "I'm managing it"

16:03.796 --> 16:05.396
To sneaking pills with vodka.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.331
- I wasn't sneaking anything.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.402
Look, sometimes my pain's bad,
it helps me sleep.

16:11.404 --> 16:14.105
I mean, you get that?
You still have pain at night.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.008
- It's not the same, hayley.
- It's only sometimes.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.611
If I don't sleep,
I can't do my job.

16:20.613 --> 16:23.748
- Are you using at work?
- Using?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.682
Seriously, wheezer?

16:25.719 --> 16:28.019
- Are you using when
you're flying with my pilots?

16:28.021 --> 16:30.821
Because I care about you,
but I am responsible for them.

16:30.857 --> 16:33.024
- No. I would never put
my patients at risk.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.759
Or my coworkers.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.095
- Crystal wrote
this prescription.
Does she know about this?

16:40.600 --> 16:44.235
Oh, jesus, hayley...
Oh, how did this get so bad?

16:45.972 --> 16:47.638
(sighing)

16:47.774 --> 16:49.306
Okay, the good news is,

16:49.308 --> 16:50.941
Is that we can just deal
with this right now.

16:51.745 --> 16:53.911
I'll make a few phone calls.

16:53.947 --> 16:56.514
The programs are all anonymous,
we can pick one together.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.783
- Wheezer, I'm not an addict.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.352
Okay? And you are not my boss.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.021
- I am responsible for
the safety of everyone

17:03.156 --> 17:04.721
On those planes,
and if you are using,

17:04.758 --> 17:06.590
Then I need to worry about...

17:06.626 --> 17:08.459
I need to worry about you, too.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.995
- Okay, so you're not my boss
when you want to sleep with me,

17:11.130 --> 17:12.329
But you are now?

17:14.868 --> 17:16.200
(scoffs)

17:18.638 --> 17:20.804
- I'm going to give you 24 hours
to deal with this.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.006
By yourself.

17:24.177 --> 17:27.545
File for leave, pick a program
and tell crystal.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.281
- No, I don't need
any of that, okay?

17:30.350 --> 17:32.950
You're not listening to me!
I don't have a problem!

17:32.986 --> 17:35.186
- If you don't, hayley,
then I will.

17:35.255 --> 17:38.155
- You know what? Keep them.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.790
I'm fine.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.760
(dramatic music)

17:52.105 --> 17:54.172
(bird screeching)

17:54.174 --> 17:56.740
- You're supposed
to have the floor done
before b shift starts.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.576
- That must have just happened.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.111
- Your job is to clean.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.846
If you can't pick up the pace--

18:01.848 --> 18:04.248
- We're sorry, sir.
We'll get it done.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.852
- I was going as fast as I can.

18:08.888 --> 18:09.987
(in hindi)

18:15.328 --> 18:18.028
(in english): Okay, a little
closer, neeta, I can't reach.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.168
Just a little more.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.876
That's good.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.646
(screams)
- ravi, no!

18:35.682 --> 18:37.548
- We'll get you to thompson
for stitches and a cast,

18:37.683 --> 18:39.683
And a ct to rule out concussion.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.153
(in hindi)

18:48.161 --> 18:50.161
(in english): Is he...
Is he going to be okay?

18:50.163 --> 18:54.165
- Yeah, he was lucky.
The boxes on the floor
broke most of his fall.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.967
Are you okay?

18:57.036 --> 18:58.970
- This is all my fault.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.906
I got dizzy when I was
driving the forklift

19:01.975 --> 19:05.142
And that's why ravi fell.
- Do you get dizzy often?

19:06.479 --> 19:09.046
Here, maybe I can help
if you'll let me take a look.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.783
What have you had to eat today?

19:14.120 --> 19:18.389
- My ravi, he used to run
a factory like this back home.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.458
And now, he's a janitor here.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.661
I'm the one who wanted
to come to canada.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.197
It was my dream,
he did it for me.

19:26.266 --> 19:30.000
We both work and ravi's going
to school for esl

19:30.036 --> 19:33.103
And extra certification
just to be able to,

19:33.139 --> 19:36.340
One day, apply for the job
he used to have at home.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.008
- Neeta, what happened?

19:38.044 --> 19:41.411
- I dropped a paint can
on my foot two weeks ago.

19:41.447 --> 19:45.349
The bruise was small, but it
kept getting bigger and bigger.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.484
- You should've seen
a doctor for this.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.288
- I can't miss work.
It's too far.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.690
The boss will cut our pay.

19:52.759 --> 19:56.427
- Sometimes, injuries
won't heal properly

19:56.562 --> 19:59.096
If a person is malnourished.

19:59.098 --> 20:02.633
- I make sure my ravi
has enough first.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.201
- Does he know?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.705
(dramatic music)

20:07.774 --> 20:09.173
(sighing)

20:09.175 --> 20:11.341
- The lab results
you were waiting on...

20:13.213 --> 20:15.513
(indistinct chatter)

20:15.648 --> 20:17.214
(gasps)

20:28.461 --> 20:30.761
- How could it be so advanced?

20:30.763 --> 20:32.996
She was fine the last time
I saw her.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.732
- Leukemia can be like that.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.101
A person can go
from perfectly healthy

20:37.236 --> 20:39.637
To final stages in three months.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.939
With cancers like this,
we have to be aggressive.

20:42.008 --> 20:45.509
Intense chemotherapy,
bone marrow transplants.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.812
Isabelle's going to be
immunocompromised,

20:48.848 --> 20:50.547
So we'll admit her
for treatment.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.416
I know this is a lot.

20:52.551 --> 20:53.884
But this is how
it's done, crystal.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.619
This is how we fight this.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.322
This is how we buy
your grandmother more time.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.024
- Yeah.

21:02.595 --> 21:06.163
- Is something wrong?
Why does neeta need to come
to the hospital, too?

21:06.199 --> 21:09.966
- Um, she has some bruises
I'd like a doctor to look at.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.902
- I knew it was wrong.
It got so big,

21:12.038 --> 21:14.605
But neeta said not to worry.
I should've insisted.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.573
You've gotten so thin.

21:16.609 --> 21:21.512
- The nurse thinks
my bruises aren't healing
because I... I don't eat.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.980
(in hindi)

21:23.115 --> 21:24.448
(in english):
We have breakfast together.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.684
It's the one meal we share.
You eat your bowl of rice

21:26.686 --> 21:29.820
When you make my lunch.
Neeta, is that all you eat?

21:29.856 --> 21:31.722
- It is my fault we came here.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.857
I've been trying to save money
so we can go back home.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.726
- Why didn't you tell me?

21:35.728 --> 21:37.795
In our seven rounds
around the fire at our wedding,

21:37.864 --> 21:39.430
We promised to walk
with each other.

21:39.499 --> 21:42.066
(in hindi)

21:42.201 --> 21:43.801
(in english): What is it?
What's wrong?

21:43.870 --> 21:46.003
- She's having a seizure.
- What the...

21:47.006 --> 21:48.139
Neeta...

21:49.208 --> 21:50.540
(gasps)

21:52.779 --> 21:54.545
- These look like
laparoscopic scars,

21:54.614 --> 21:55.946
Has she had surgery recently?

21:56.015 --> 21:57.114
- Those are from when she had

21:57.249 --> 21:59.282
Her gallbladder removed
back in india.

22:00.253 --> 22:02.018
- 45-year-old male,
scalp laceration,

22:02.055 --> 22:03.554
Likely distal radius fracture.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.288
45-year-old female,
extensive bruising

22:05.325 --> 22:08.092
And ruptured surgical wounds.
- How recent was the surgery?

22:08.094 --> 22:11.762
- At least three years.
The patient's malnourished.
Doesn't eat.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.330
- That's not bruising,
that's petechiae.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.798
- What is it?
What's wrong with her?

22:17.036 --> 22:18.836
- I think she has
advanced scurvy.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.438
I've seen this before
in patients from northern
communities.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.107
So hard to get fresh
produce up there.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.142
- Is she going to be okay?
- She needs high doses

22:25.178 --> 22:28.478
Of vitamin c and surgery
to repair the incisions.

22:28.514 --> 22:29.980
Page the or.
- Yeah.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.383
- Ravi, I want to walk with you.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.852
(in hindi)

22:38.458 --> 22:40.724
(indistinct pa announcement)

22:40.727 --> 22:43.226
(dramatic music)

22:51.604 --> 22:52.937
(sighing)

22:54.140 --> 22:56.239
(clock ticking)

22:57.410 --> 22:59.276
(sighing)

23:01.681 --> 23:03.981
(breathing heavily)

23:11.424 --> 23:13.023
(sniffling)

23:13.159 --> 23:16.359
(breathing heavily)

23:24.570 --> 23:26.636
(suspenseful music)

23:28.641 --> 23:29.907
(gasps)
- hey, I need to get rid

23:29.976 --> 23:31.775
Of my skymed shift tomorrow,
can you take it?

23:31.844 --> 23:33.677
- Is everything okay?

23:33.746 --> 23:36.914
- Isabelle has leukemia.
- Oh, my god.

23:37.884 --> 23:40.784
Crys... I'm so sorry.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.120
- She starts chemo tomorrow.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.589
They have to eradicate
her entire immune system

23:45.625 --> 23:48.792
And give her a bone marrow
transplant to rebuild it.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.595
- Crys...
- Isabelle's always been there.

23:51.631 --> 23:54.998
The seasons change,
sunrises, and kookoo's there.

23:55.034 --> 23:58.402
In her kitchen,
making teas or...

23:58.537 --> 24:00.604
Beading.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.510
- Yeah, stay with her.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.680
I'll cover your shift.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.414
- Thank you.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.621
(sighing)

24:17.623 --> 24:20.024
(tense music)

24:23.896 --> 24:25.362
(sighing)

24:32.104 --> 24:38.708
(upbeat music)

24:38.744 --> 24:41.111
- Would another drink help
or make it worse?

24:41.180 --> 24:44.180
- I just want this done.
Then can we go home?

24:44.217 --> 24:45.782
- To your mom's or thompson?

24:45.818 --> 24:47.718
- I don't care. Anywhere I don't
have to give a speech.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.920
- Uh, excuse me, everyone!

24:50.055 --> 24:51.688
It's time for speeches!

24:51.757 --> 24:53.123
- You can do this.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.659
(applause)

24:56.395 --> 24:57.661
(clears throat)

24:59.899 --> 25:02.098
- Hi, everyone. I, uh...

25:03.002 --> 25:05.002
I'm michelle's son.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.005
Anyway.

25:08.007 --> 25:11.341
I've never understood
relationships.

25:11.377 --> 25:17.214
The idea of... Being
with just one person

25:17.349 --> 25:19.750
And letting them know
all your flaws

25:19.819 --> 25:22.652
And having to rely on them,
it's just... Scary.

25:24.323 --> 25:27.891
Until I met someone.

25:29.161 --> 25:32.296
And now I understand why anthony
makes my mom so happy.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.398
And it's not just because
he makes her laugh.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.433
(laughing)

25:37.836 --> 25:41.639
When you have a partner that
loves you and supports you,

25:41.774 --> 25:43.740
It isn't scary.

25:44.544 --> 25:45.709
It...

25:46.479 --> 25:49.046
It feels easy.

25:50.917 --> 25:53.384
And that's what
I didn't understand.

25:54.753 --> 25:58.589
When someone loves you,
you don't care about your flaws.

25:58.724 --> 26:03.460
When someone loves you,
it feels safe to rely on them.

26:03.496 --> 26:05.529
To trust them with their heart.
(breathing heavily)

26:05.664 --> 26:09.266
Because you know that person
will never let you down.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.268
(applause)

26:11.403 --> 26:12.602
- Excuse me.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.875
(retching)

26:17.877 --> 26:20.611
(breathing heavily)

26:25.551 --> 26:27.151
(retching)

26:27.153 --> 26:29.486
(rhythmic music)

26:29.488 --> 26:32.489
(indistinct chatter)

26:33.993 --> 26:37.127
(panting)
- I think I need a break.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.962
- I'll be right back.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.499
- Mm. There you are!
I've been looking for you!

26:42.535 --> 26:44.300
Did you see my speech?
You were right,

26:44.337 --> 26:46.003
All I needed to do was
speak from my hea--

26:46.005 --> 26:47.337
- I slept with someone else.

26:48.474 --> 26:50.306
(scoffs)
- what?

26:50.343 --> 26:53.176
- I love you, tristan,
but I did a stupid thing.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.846
It was wrong and I regret
every second of it,

26:55.848 --> 26:58.715
But when hayley posted those
photos from the drag club,

26:58.784 --> 27:01.585
I thought, it looked
like something happened

27:01.720 --> 27:04.120
Between you and reese, and
I, I just... I couldn't--

27:04.156 --> 27:06.390
- You slept with someone?
- He was no one.

27:06.525 --> 27:09.993
And they were a stranger
and it didn't mean anything.
And I wanted to tell you--

27:09.996 --> 27:12.796
- And you thought now
was a good time to tell me?

27:12.832 --> 27:16.133
- I know, I know it was wrong.
And I'm wrong.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.468
I'm... I'm so sorry, tris.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.537
(bottle clinking)
(breathing heavily)

27:20.606 --> 27:22.006
- Mom?

27:22.141 --> 27:24.074
(gasping)
I got you.

27:26.745 --> 27:28.412
(muttering)

27:30.349 --> 27:32.149
She's tachycardic,
her pulse is racing.

27:32.218 --> 27:34.351
- She takes pills for her heart.
I saw anthony get them ready,

27:34.486 --> 27:36.020
But she doesn't like
to take them.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.888
- It's my wedding!
- I don't have my bag,
call an ambulance!

27:45.064 --> 27:46.663
I'm going to ride with you,
okay, mom?

27:46.732 --> 27:48.298
- I'll follow you
in the rental car

27:48.367 --> 27:50.234
And meet you at the hospital?
- I think you've done enough.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.269
- You shouldn't be alone
right now.

27:52.404 --> 27:53.369
(scoffs)

28:00.079 --> 28:01.678
(phone chiming)

28:01.681 --> 28:04.448
- Man, can't wait to pick up
joel and go not-sleep at home.

28:04.517 --> 28:05.716
(chuckling)
(phone chiming)

28:05.718 --> 28:07.985
(screams of excitement)

28:08.120 --> 28:11.188
Yo, is that our video?
Bro, you posted it online?

28:11.257 --> 28:14.390
- No, no, no. I sent it to my
buddy jake at selection camp.

28:14.427 --> 28:16.326
He was bragging about
all the cool shit

28:16.395 --> 28:18.062
That he gets to do
so I wanted him to see

28:18.197 --> 28:19.996
That I was doing
cool stuff, too.

28:19.998 --> 28:21.431
He must have posted it.

28:21.467 --> 28:24.268
- Chops, if we get caught,
we could lose our licences.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.936
- Wait, wait a second.
You don't see our faces.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.739
It doesn't say who it is, right?

28:28.874 --> 28:31.407
There's no mention
of an airline or a plane.

28:31.444 --> 28:34.611
C'mon, there's no way anyone
will know that it's us.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.780
- I just had to ground
our entire fleet.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.615
They all need to be checked
for stress damage

28:38.617 --> 28:40.583
Because of an unauthorized roll.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.021
Well, c'mon, guys,
don't rush to confess.

28:44.156 --> 28:46.623
I recognized chopper's ring,
and if I did,

28:46.625 --> 28:49.292
Then someone else might, too.
- It was 933.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.895
You don't have to check
the other planes. We...

28:52.030 --> 28:54.564
We had no patient
or medic on board.

28:54.633 --> 28:56.834
We were just fooling
around, wheez.

28:56.969 --> 28:59.035
You know how it is.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.104
- Do you know how many calls
we're missing

29:01.107 --> 29:03.173
Because I had to ground
all of our planes?

29:03.175 --> 29:05.375
This isn't about you two
being bored,

29:05.444 --> 29:07.978
It's about skymed and everyone
who depends on us.

29:07.980 --> 29:11.248
- It was all me...
Sir, it was not bodie.

29:11.317 --> 29:15.118
- No, no, no.
Bodie, he let you do it.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.654
As captain, he's responsible
or he should be.

29:17.723 --> 29:19.723
Now, I don't know if either
of you guys noticed,

29:19.792 --> 29:21.758
But I've been doing everything
I can to keep us afloat

29:21.827 --> 29:24.128
So this expansion won't tank us.

29:25.631 --> 29:27.964
We just lost the kenora
health contract.

29:28.768 --> 29:30.334
They think we're too untested.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.669
And it's sure as shit would
not help if they found out

29:32.738 --> 29:35.138
That I got pilots
rolling planes!

29:36.208 --> 29:38.008
I have been...

29:38.010 --> 29:40.610
I've been killing myself
worrying about your jobs.

29:40.646 --> 29:42.345
Not mine, yours.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.147
Until you guys are ready
to grow up

29:44.150 --> 29:46.550
And worry about someone
other than yourselves...

29:48.554 --> 29:49.953
...You're both grounded.

29:57.429 --> 30:00.597
- Doctor said you're stable
but you need to rest.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.966
And no more skipping doses.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.701
I'll call anthony.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.202
Let him know we're back.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.508
- I'm so proud of you.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.314
- Are you, though?
- Of course.

30:18.884 --> 30:23.019
You're a smart, caring youn--
- darius was my fault.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.555
- Is that what you think?

30:25.558 --> 30:27.457
- I can see it every time
you look at me.

30:27.593 --> 30:30.460
How much you miss him.
How much you blame me.

30:32.798 --> 30:34.530
You never trusted me after.

30:36.301 --> 30:37.634
- Come here.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.743
I am...

30:46.745 --> 30:49.812
Sad when I look at you.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.216
But not because I blame you.

30:54.386 --> 30:57.086
Not because I...
I don't trust you.

30:58.524 --> 31:02.693
What happened to darius
was not your fault.

31:05.564 --> 31:09.099
And I don't, for one second,
blame you.

31:09.234 --> 31:10.834
It's just...

31:10.969 --> 31:12.970
Sometimes, when I look at you,

31:12.972 --> 31:16.773
When I'm so proud of the man
that you've become...

31:18.544 --> 31:20.043
(sighing)

31:20.880 --> 31:22.379
...I can't help thinking

31:22.448 --> 31:26.616
About the man darius
might have become.

31:27.619 --> 31:31.121
After he died,
I knew you needed me.

31:31.123 --> 31:34.724
But it was so hard
to be there for you

31:34.760 --> 31:38.929
When... I wasn't
fully there myself.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.665
And for that,

31:43.869 --> 31:45.835
I'm so sorry, baby.

31:51.877 --> 31:53.609
I miss him.

31:56.282 --> 31:58.748
But I miss you, too, tristan.

32:00.619 --> 32:03.453
And I don't want to miss
anything anymore.

32:09.495 --> 32:12.962
How are you? My baby...

32:15.000 --> 32:16.733
How's your life?

32:19.038 --> 32:20.971
How's your heart?

32:23.208 --> 32:25.976
(sobbing)

32:25.978 --> 32:28.811
I... I think it's breaking, mom.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.586
(dramatic music)

32:45.998 --> 32:47.597
- I thought I was flying
with bodie.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.599
- Yeah, bodie's grounded.
Chopper, too.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.467
You got it, cap.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.669
I'll do this,
and then the pre-flights.

32:53.706 --> 32:54.938
(sighing)
- great.

32:55.007 --> 32:57.507
Can the day get any better?
- Here, use mine.

32:57.509 --> 32:58.641
- Thank you.

32:59.678 --> 33:00.744
Birch wing air?

33:02.448 --> 33:04.814
You're not thinking about
jumping ship, are you, martine?

33:06.652 --> 33:07.850
- Should I be?

33:09.021 --> 33:11.154
- Well, you gotta do what's
best for you, but...

33:12.458 --> 33:14.457
- I brought coffee.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.562
I thought I was flying
with bodie.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.500
- What are you doing here?

33:23.502 --> 33:25.168
I gave you 24 hours
to deal with your stuff

33:25.204 --> 33:27.037
And time's almost up.
- Yeah, I'm just covering

33:27.106 --> 33:29.872
For crystal until her kookum
gets her first round of chemo.

33:30.509 --> 33:31.574
- Isabelle's sick?

33:32.378 --> 33:34.177
Okay, so, you, uh...

33:34.213 --> 33:35.712
You talked to crystal then.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.447
- It's just for a few hours.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.049
And I gave you
all my pills so...

33:39.118 --> 33:40.583
(beeping)

33:42.554 --> 33:44.521
Look, I'm fit for duty.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.790
So, it's up to you if you want
to leave a patient hanging.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.658
- Promise me that
you are safe to do this.

33:48.794 --> 33:52.228
- I would never
put a patient in danger.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.132
(sighing)

33:58.370 --> 34:00.504
- Stef! I brought the cables.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.739
What's all this?

34:02.874 --> 34:05.742
- Okay, so...
I didn't need a jump.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.011
Look, you didn't want
a relationship

34:08.146 --> 34:10.080
Because you were afraid
it would derail your dream.

34:10.215 --> 34:13.016
And I sort of thought
you were worried for nothing...

34:13.018 --> 34:15.852
Until I got all weird
when I realized

34:15.854 --> 34:18.755
That you might have to leave
to follow that dream.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.625
But lex...

34:21.627 --> 34:24.193
Your passion for flying,

34:24.229 --> 34:25.928
It's who you are.

34:27.165 --> 34:29.665
When I saw you
with wheezer, I...

34:30.969 --> 34:32.635
I get it now.

34:32.671 --> 34:34.704
Your whole future at skymed,

34:34.773 --> 34:36.906
Whether you ever get
to go captain here again,

34:36.975 --> 34:38.975
Depends on what one guy
thinks of you.

34:38.977 --> 34:41.645
It's... It's kind of
bullshit actually.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.848
- Well, even if I do go
to another airline,

34:44.850 --> 34:47.317
We can figure it out.

34:47.319 --> 34:50.253
We can work on something.
(laughing)

34:50.388 --> 34:54.791
- Whatever happens,
we gotta enjoy the moments
we have right now. Hm?

34:54.860 --> 34:56.192
(chuckling)

34:58.864 --> 35:00.897
(soft music)

35:02.534 --> 35:04.167
<i> - The nurse just did that.</i>

35:05.170 --> 35:07.837
They're making me dizzy,
all this fussing.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.307
I'd feel better
if I could smudge.

35:12.744 --> 35:15.946
(in nêhiyawêwin)

35:15.948 --> 35:18.815
(in english): At home,
I can smell the pines.

35:18.817 --> 35:22.151
Feel the wind on my face
to make me strong.

35:23.956 --> 35:26.956
Maybe I'll make you
new earrings.

35:26.992 --> 35:28.525
Studs this time.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.894
Something you'll actually wear.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.298
(sobbing)

35:35.433 --> 35:36.699
Oh...

35:38.570 --> 35:40.303
- I don't want to lose you,
kookoo,

35:40.339 --> 35:42.305
It feels like I'm losing myself.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.506
- Ah...

35:52.384 --> 35:54.250
(moaning)
(crying)

35:57.789 --> 36:00.389
- I don't know how to do this.

36:02.727 --> 36:05.795
I have to be the med student
that you want me to be.

36:05.864 --> 36:08.531
And to stay true
to our community.

36:09.935 --> 36:11.868
I don't know how to do that,

36:12.003 --> 36:14.471
I don't know how to be
two different things at once.

36:14.606 --> 36:17.941
- Oh, but you already are,
<i> nôsisim.</i>

36:18.010 --> 36:23.079
You are cree, you are metis,
and you are filipina.

36:23.081 --> 36:27.150
You are a nurse, you are
a teacher, you are a student.

36:28.753 --> 36:31.354
(in nêhiyawêwin)

36:32.757 --> 36:35.625
(in english): You already know
how to be many things.

36:38.630 --> 36:43.366
- I've only been those things
with... With you, kookoo.

36:44.903 --> 36:47.903
(in nêhiyawêwin)

36:51.576 --> 36:53.809
(in english): Death isn't
like that, my girl.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.446
It's just the start
of the next journey.

36:57.482 --> 37:02.652
You'll always have me
and your ancestors to guide you.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.088
You just have to listen.

37:12.064 --> 37:14.731
(soft music)

37:26.245 --> 37:27.277
- Seriously, chops?

37:27.279 --> 37:29.813
- Trust me, this is going
to fix everything.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.981
- This?
(chuckling)

37:31.984 --> 37:35.217
This doesn't look like
it can fly at all.

37:35.254 --> 37:36.953
- Ah, not yet.

37:37.022 --> 37:39.356
But it is selling for cheap
and with repairs...

37:39.491 --> 37:42.359
Look, kinglsey has access to the
grocery suppliers, right?

37:42.494 --> 37:44.827
He can get the things people
up north actually need,

37:44.863 --> 37:46.496
There just isn't a way
to get it to them.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.031
But this, bodes, I mean,

37:48.033 --> 37:49.699
You could charge half of
what the other cargo companies

37:49.735 --> 37:51.701
Charge nowadays
and still make money.

37:51.703 --> 37:52.969
And this stuff will get to the

37:53.104 --> 37:55.238
People who actually need it.
(car approaching)

37:55.307 --> 37:57.574
- Look, even if I could
buy this,

37:57.576 --> 38:00.509
I'd need money for repairs,
start a business.

38:00.545 --> 38:01.711
- Is this it?

38:02.714 --> 38:04.147
Definitely some miles on her.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.449
- You told him about this?

38:06.518 --> 38:08.150
- Look, I know you weren't

38:08.186 --> 38:10.720
Comfortable taking
my money, austin.

38:10.855 --> 38:15.258
But, what if you consider
an investment?

38:15.393 --> 38:16.793
Hmm?

38:16.795 --> 38:19.128
And not just for you,
but for me as well.

38:19.197 --> 38:22.265
See, I always liked the idea of
helping out the communities

38:22.334 --> 38:24.600
Like the one that jolene
came from.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.470
And also, I get to...

38:27.472 --> 38:29.272
I get to spend
some time with you.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.213
- Hey, your grandmother's
being discharged?

38:37.349 --> 38:39.815
- Yeah.
I'm going to take her home.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.018
I'll go up to north house
and give her her chemo there.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.686
- Crystal, I can't advise that.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.955
Her immune system
is severely compromised.

38:46.091 --> 38:49.492
- Yeah, but her spirit
will be stronger.

38:49.627 --> 38:51.761
She doesn't want to live longer

38:51.896 --> 38:53.496
If it means she's away
from her community.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.331
Away from her medicine.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.599
Look, I've been a flight nurse

38:56.601 --> 38:57.967
Longer than I've been
a med student.

38:58.103 --> 38:59.836
And we go into the field
all the time.

38:59.905 --> 39:03.038
And we do things that doctors
would never do in a hospital.

39:03.075 --> 39:06.309
We make do with what we have
and we take care of our own.

39:06.311 --> 39:08.511
And I've decided
to amend my paper,

39:08.646 --> 39:10.914
To include my father's stories
about our ancestors.

39:11.049 --> 39:14.016
- Crystal... I know
that family means a lot to you

39:14.086 --> 39:16.119
And I know that this
is an emotional time,

39:16.254 --> 39:18.521
But you really need
to think about this.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.723
This is a huge opportunity,

39:20.726 --> 39:23.126
And you can't just risk
throwing that away

39:23.195 --> 39:24.928
Or jeopardizing your career.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.197
- I, I know you've been
trying to help me,

39:27.332 --> 39:29.065
And I appreciate it.

39:30.202 --> 39:33.669
But... I can't be like you,
dr. Yana. I...

39:34.873 --> 39:37.140
I can't keep giving up
pieces of who I am

39:37.275 --> 39:39.241
Just because this is
how it's done.

39:46.684 --> 39:48.217
<i> I'll come up tonight</i>
<i> to get you</i>

39:48.253 --> 39:49.552
Through the first
couple of days.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.020
It's always the worst
after chemo.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.822
- You think I can't take care
of myself?

39:52.858 --> 39:55.892
- I know you can,
just let me for once.

39:55.961 --> 39:59.161
And maybe you can teach me
how to make some teas.

40:00.132 --> 40:02.131
- First-class ticket
to north house?

40:02.167 --> 40:04.233
- Oh, who's this fancy
chief pilot?

40:04.302 --> 40:06.302
- Only the best for family,
isabelle.

40:06.304 --> 40:08.438
And I even brought you
your very own escort.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.172
(laughing)

40:10.208 --> 40:12.375
- Do you... Do you want to put
a coat on before we go?

40:12.510 --> 40:14.911
It's a little chilly out there.
- Not with you, handsome.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.980
Hoo-ha. Aren't you hotter
than rocks in a sweat!

40:18.016 --> 40:19.715
Where you've been
hiding this one?

40:19.751 --> 40:20.850
(laughing)

40:22.320 --> 40:25.588
- Oh, he is definitely
getting a cheek pinch.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.191
- Yeah.
- How is she?

40:28.326 --> 40:30.527
- She'll get the medicine
she needs.

40:30.662 --> 40:33.262
Thanks for coming.
- Oh, it's the least I can do.

40:33.298 --> 40:34.831
Something I'm actually good at.

40:34.966 --> 40:37.400
It's just...
Just chief pilot stuff.

40:37.469 --> 40:39.602
I got pilots jumping ship,
I got pilots pulling stunts.

40:39.671 --> 40:43.105
I mean, I have no idea
how pierce handled it.

40:43.175 --> 40:45.274
- Well, he had you
to lean on so...

40:45.343 --> 40:47.143
- Yeah. Hmm.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.812
I'm glad that hayley
told you about the pills,

40:48.947 --> 40:50.546
That's one worry off my mind.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.482
- What pills?

40:54.419 --> 40:56.152
- Thought she talked
to you, she...

40:56.221 --> 40:57.821
She said she was going
to talk to you.

41:11.236 --> 41:13.002
- Hey.

41:14.473 --> 41:17.840
I have to...
I have to tell you something.

41:24.483 --> 41:29.485
After my surgery, I, um...
I was having a lot of pain.

41:30.522 --> 41:33.889
And I kept thinking
about my mom...

41:35.760 --> 41:38.060
(breathing shakily)

41:40.798 --> 41:42.532
I think I have a problem.

41:44.802 --> 41:46.335
With pills.

41:46.404 --> 41:48.271
- Wheezer told me.

41:52.744 --> 41:54.610
I love you, hayley.

41:54.646 --> 41:58.347
And I'll help you get
whatever help you need.

41:59.985 --> 42:01.350
But you used me.

42:03.955 --> 42:05.822
You asked me to write you
a prescription,

42:05.957 --> 42:08.390
Knowing you were going
to abuse it.

42:08.426 --> 42:10.293
- No. No, crys.
It wasn't like that--

42:10.428 --> 42:12.895
- You know how I feel
about drugs.

42:12.931 --> 42:15.431
And you know how hard
the community has worked

42:15.500 --> 42:17.967
To prevent this kind of thing,
and you know...

42:19.304 --> 42:22.571
...How much it means to me
and to them

42:22.607 --> 42:24.641
For me to become a doctor.

42:24.776 --> 42:27.710
And all of that could go away

42:27.712 --> 42:30.379
If anyone finds out
what you did.

42:30.415 --> 42:32.315
I could get kicked out
of med school,

42:32.317 --> 42:34.550
I could lose my np licence.

42:34.586 --> 42:39.521
I'm the only indigenous
woman in my class, hayley.

42:39.558 --> 42:43.058
And I don't get
to make mistakes.

42:43.094 --> 42:45.061
- Crys, I was going to tell you.

42:45.130 --> 42:48.331
I was going to tell you
that night at the whiskey hatch,
but you stood me up.

42:48.333 --> 42:50.099
- Are you saying it's my fault?

42:55.340 --> 42:58.007
I love you, hayley,
but right now I don't like you.

42:58.009 --> 43:00.143
- No, crystal, crystal... No...

43:01.780 --> 43:03.413
(sobbing)

43:15.026 --> 43:16.793
