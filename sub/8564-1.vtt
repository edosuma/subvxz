There are two types of soldiers
in this world: the quick and the dead!

00:40.078 --> 00:42.524
R-Division, we are the quick.
You got that'?

00:42.581 --> 00:44.925
Yes, sir!

01:12.411 --> 01:17.724
<i>It's a simple organism,
which reproduces itself by dividing.</i>

01:17.783 --> 01:21.230
<i>Our bodies are made up
of mil/ions of cells.</i>

<i>They're the building blocks
of our blood and tissues.</i>

01:25.824 --> 01:29.101

01:29.161 --> 01:32.608

02:02.094 --> 02:05.473

14:02.513 --> 14:04.891
What do you have to say to them?

14:10.788 --> 14:12.631
The call to arms against the re-animates...

14:12.690 --> 14:15.728

social boundaries including...

become introspective...

with their problems differently.

15:32.637 --> 15:34.844

<i>Come on, Bobby. l_et's go.</i>

16:13.478 --> 16:14.980
Looks like they’re gonna try...

16:15.046 --> 16:16.616
and make contact with vvhoeveﬁs inside.

16:16.681 --> 16:18.126
- Get down!
- Oh, my God!

16:24.255 --> 16:26.565
Two tours in Afghanistan...

16:26.624 --> 16:29.195
one tour in Iran, one tour in Pakistan...

16:29.260 --> 16:31.467
before it Went up in smoke.

16:31.529 --> 16:33.941
That place was-.

16:33.998 --> 16:37.343
The guys got soldiering questions,
they come to me.

16:37.402 --> 16:40.212
- Cover me!
- Got him!

16:41.706 --> 16:43.379
Move! Move!

16:43.441 --> 16:45.853
Sarge is approaching the front door.

16:46.878 --> 16:49.256
Jesus!

16:54.218 --> 16:55.788
Stay down!

16:55.853 --> 16:58.026
- Get the-out of my way! Move!
- Oh, okay!

16:58.089 --> 16:59.227
- Move!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.099
- Where is it?
- Where’s What?

17:04.328 --> 17:06.705
Matthews, Hernandez, check it out.

17:06.763 --> 17:08.868
Yeah. <i>I'll</i> go with them to the barn.

17:08.933 --> 17:10.844
I'm staying with the Sarge.

17:13.003 --> 17:14.881
- Keep close.
- Yeah.

17:17.074 --> 17:19.054
- We got Re-Ans.
- What?

17:19.109 --> 17:21.282
Why would they keep Re-Ans in a cage?

17:22.280 --> 17:23.884
- Call it.
- On three.

17:23.948 --> 17:26.053
One, two-

17:27.251 --> 17:29.458
Wait!

17:31.022 --> 17:32.194
Sarge?

17:38.429 --> 17:40.739
Sarge, What are you doing?

17:44.602 --> 17:45.910
Oh, Jesus.

17:45.970 --> 17:48.075
Just food for whatever
they got inside.

17:50.308 --> 17:53.274
All right, you camera boys
want to know why we're here'?

17:57.849 --> 18:00.728
We’re— We’re protecting her.
We’re protecting her.

18:00.785 --> 18:02.492
We’re gonna see ifthere’s gonna be a cure.

18:02.553 --> 18:05.261
You dorft know there’s not.
You dorft know there’s not.

18:05.323 --> 18:06.893
Tell me where.

18:06.958 --> 18:09.768
You dorft know What ifs like
to see-to watch your-

18:09.827 --> 18:13.741
You think you're the only one
who's lost somebody?

18:13.798 --> 18:15.903
He’s hiding something.

18:15.967 --> 18:18.243
Where is it?

18:19.237 --> 18:21.239
I do R-Division two years.

18:21.305 --> 18:25.185
I get a green card for
me and for my family.

18:25.243 --> 18:27.849
Thafs why I do this.

18:27.912 --> 18:31.018
- Where is she?
- The attic.

18:31.082 --> 18:32.584
In the attic.

18:32.650 --> 18:34.960
We have a confirmation
there’s a Re-An in the house.

18:35.019 --> 18:37.158
Remember five years ago?

18:37.221 --> 18:40.691
L-low it spread so quickly?

18:40.758 --> 18:42.260
People got bit...

18:42.326 --> 18:46.775
but hoped against all hope
that they vvouldrft turn.

18:46.831 --> 18:48.708
They hid their infected relatives...

18:48.766 --> 18:53.909
their husbands, wives,
girlfriends, cousins, whatever.

18:53.971 --> 18:58.215
They were all dead, all infected...

18:58.276 --> 19:01.621
but we ooulcln't accept it.

19:01.679 --> 19:05.286
Couldrft let it go.

19:05.349 --> 19:08.455
It was our humanity
that nearly wiped us out.

19:08.519 --> 19:10.556
Shit. Shit.

19:10.621 --> 19:12.897
All right, rookie. You ready?

19:12.957 --> 19:14.917
- It looks like we're moving in.
- I'm sorry, Sis!

19:14.959 --> 19:16.404
- I'm sorry!
- Shut up!

19:18.162 --> 19:19.937
Okay.

19:19.997 --> 19:22.034
We are headed upstairs.

19:29.307 --> 19:32.481
Oh, God! lt smells awful.

19:32.543 --> 19:34.045
Oh.

19:53.431 --> 19:55.604
I think I hear it.

20:00.705 --> 20:03.618
<i>_</i>
D|d you get it? Did you get it?

20:17.188 --> 20:19.361
Get her, Winston! Find her!

20:19.423 --> 20:21.801
Goddamn it!

20:21.859 --> 20:23.600
Tom got bit.

20:23.661 --> 20:26.471
Oh, no. Ah.

20:26.530 --> 20:28.703
Eve Please, no!

20:45.449 --> 20:46.587
- Sarge.
- Dispatch.

20:46.651 --> 20:48.153
- Sergeant.
- R-Division 8, over.

20:48.219 --> 20:49.755
<i>- [ Dispatch j Dispatch. Go ahead
- Sarge!</i>

20:49.820 --> 20:51.993
- One re-animate located
and destroyed. Over and out.

20:52.056 --> 20:55.230
Sarge, he’s turning! Sarge!

21:01.532 --> 21:03.534
I was a lost soul.

21:05.469 --> 21:08.313
Did a lot of bad things
before the outbreak.

21:08.372 --> 21:11.182
Then I found God.

21:11.242 --> 21:13.518
And I was reborn as one of his warriors...

21:13.577 --> 21:17.252
to remove these things
from the garden of his creation.

21:17.314 --> 21:20.352
Do you really believe that, Winston?

21:37.668 --> 21:38.976
Mom?

21:39.036 --> 21:41.277
Mom died during the outbreak.

21:41.338 --> 21:43.215
And-

21:44.608 --> 21:46.349
No, she vvasrft infected or anything.

21:46.410 --> 21:50.051
She— She starved during the long Winter.

21:50.114 --> 21:52.788
So... she Went out human.

21:52.850 --> 21:55.729
- Ls that important?
- Yeah.

21:55.786 --> 21:58.289
I mean, we-

21:58.355 --> 22:01.393
You know, we're born human.

22:01.459 --> 22:04.065
We die that Way.

22:04.128 --> 22:05.664
You know, not like one of them.

22:07.898 --> 22:11.573
It's always hard losing one of your own.

22:15.172 --> 22:17.948
I dorft know.

22:21.212 --> 22:23.488
Dad-He said-

22:26.283 --> 22:29.730
Basically told me not to be dumb.

22:29.787 --> 22:32.495
But, uh, I think he’d be proud of me.

22:32.556 --> 22:35.469
You know, this is my way of honoring him.

22:39.330 --> 22:41.332
<i>N</i>

23:09.126 --> 23:12.107
<i>U</i>

23:14.031 --> 23:15.271
Ooh.

23:43.894 --> 23:45.669
You’ve lost a lot of people like Tom.

23:45.729 --> 23:47.470
- Ls that hard?
- Yeah.

23:47.531 --> 23:49.943
İt's part of what we clo.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.503
The most unpleasant part.

23:52.570 --> 23:54.481
But it comes with the job.

23:54.538 --> 23:58.645
Every man and Woman that
signed up for R-Division knows the risks.

23:58.709 --> 24:00.848
And they’re Willing to pay
the ultimate price.

24:00.911 --> 24:03.585
Are you prepared to pay that price?

24:03.647 --> 24:06.150
Is anyone?

24:07.585 --> 24:10.623
All right, let's make the boy's mark.

24:14.458 --> 24:16.836
L-low many of your own
guys have you hacl to-

24:16.894 --> 24:18.100
You know?

24:18.162 --> 24:20.267
We dorft talk about that.

24:20.331 --> 24:23.005
You sure were shit out of luck, Tim.

24:23.067 --> 24:26.105
His name was Tom.

24:26.170 --> 24:27.911
Whatever.

24:27.972 --> 24:30.043
Hovv do you think the outbreak got started?

24:30.107 --> 24:32.246
İt's Gods will.

24:32.309 --> 24:34.915
But ifs not Judgment Day.

24:34.979 --> 24:37.983
Maybe ifs just a cleansing
to weed out the bad...

24:38.048 --> 24:40.494
to bring us back to simpler times and ways.

24:40.551 --> 24:42.963
Hovv do you know God
doesrft mean it to be the end?

24:43.020 --> 24:45.296
Because he has a bigger plan for us.

24:45.356 --> 24:48.963
I mean, you’re still here, right?

24:49.026 --> 24:50.699
Just.

24:50.761 --> 24:52.934
When I was a soldier,
|’d— die for my country.

24:52.997 --> 24:57.207
But I'm telling ya, if there was ever a
truly-situation...

24:57.268 --> 24:59.179
you can bet the military's involved.

24:59.236 --> 25:04.549
I mean, you got any idea hovv much money
they spend on biovveapon research?

25:04.608 --> 25:06.110
I figure they screwed up one day...

25:06.176 --> 25:08.452
and invented something
they couldrft un-invent.

25:08.512 --> 25:10.048
Right, Grizzly?

25:12.116 --> 25:14.255
He believes me though. Right, Grizzly?

25:14.318 --> 25:16.525
About the army.

25:16.587 --> 25:17.759
Yeah.

25:17.821 --> 25:20.199
Command and Control.

25:20.257 --> 25:23.170
This is the brain of the entire
R-Division operation.

25:23.227 --> 25:25.503
R-Div 8, this is Command Central.

25:25.562 --> 25:27.872
- <i>Come baa/c</i>
- R-Div 8. Go ahead.

25:27.932 --> 25:29.434
I need you to intercept a semi truck...

25:29.500 --> 25:31.776
less than a quarter of a mile
away from your current location.

25:31.835 --> 25:36.341
The vehicle is moving at a high rate of
speed and possibly carrying Re-Ans.

25:36.407 --> 25:39.251
<i>- Proceed with caution. He's gonna run.
- Over.</i>

25:39.310 --> 25:41.051
All right, crew, look alive.

25:41.111 --> 25:44.217
İt's gonna get ugly.

25:45.950 --> 25:48.726
<i>This is R-Division! Pull over now!</i>

26:48.245 --> 26:50.122
Move it! Move, move, move!

26:50.180 --> 26:51.989
Out of the cab! Now!

26:52.049 --> 26:54.051
- Get out!
- Okay, okay, take it easy!

26:55.285 --> 26:57.856
Get out of the truck. On the ground!

27:02.493 --> 27:04.973
What the hell is
your problem, man? Come on!

27:05.029 --> 27:07.703
- What do you have in the back?
- I got DVD players in the back, man.

27:07.765 --> 27:09.005
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:09.066 --> 27:12.604
Show me. Come on. Back, cover!

27:12.669 --> 27:14.910
Why would they be running if
they weren't hiding something?

27:14.972 --> 27:16.781
- Move!
- I need a lawyer!

27:16.840 --> 27:20.686
- I need-
- Case dismissed. Cuff him.

27:20.744 --> 27:24.055
- Take it easy!
- I got this thing on TV.

27:24.114 --> 27:25.684
- Open up.
- All right.

27:29.586 --> 27:32.157
This doesrft feel right.

27:34.591 --> 27:36.571
I dorft like it.

27:36.627 --> 27:38.629
Get up there. Go.

27:38.695 --> 27:40.800
Th-There's just DVD players in here.

27:40.864 --> 27:42.366
There’s nothing else in there.

27:42.433 --> 27:44.674
Look-
There’s nothing else in there!

27:44.735 --> 27:45.594
Hernandez!

27:45.607 --> 27:47.739
There’s nothing else in there!

27:47.805 --> 27:50.217
- There’s just-
They’re just DVD players in there!
- Move!

27:50.274 --> 27:54.222
- There’s nothing else in there!
- Parker, Winston, check it out.

28:24.241 --> 28:26.278
They're tough to put clown, yeah.

28:26.343 --> 28:29.950
|t’s got to be a head shot,
but sometimes even that dorft get it done.

28:30.013 --> 28:32.323
You gotta destroy the brain stem.

28:32.382 --> 28:35.386
And I seen them take five or six bullets in
the head before they go dovvn.

28:35.452 --> 28:39.730
And I svvear to God, it’s like
shooting them just pisses them off...

28:39.790 --> 28:41.428
and they come at you even harder.

29:36.413 --> 29:39.417
Clear it, Grizzly! Yeah! Get them!

29:47.224 --> 29:49.727
I mean...

29:49.793 --> 29:52.296
they died once already.

29:52.362 --> 29:54.501
It airft easy making them do it over.

29:54.565 --> 29:54.664
Adams, close the gate!

29:54.665 --> 29:56.167
Adams, close the gate!

30:12.115 --> 30:13.287
Close it!

30:27.531 --> 30:28.703
RPG!

30:40.043 --> 30:43.024
Welcome back.

30:43.080 --> 30:46.459
Right now the guys are going around...

30:46.516 --> 30:48.962
To re-kill all of the Re-Ans.

30:49.019 --> 30:50.521
|t’s never been seen before on TV.

30:50.587 --> 30:53.227
- You ready for this?
- Yes, sir.

30:53.290 --> 30:57.363
L-low will we know
when we finally achieve victory?

30:57.427 --> 30:59.065
Officially...

30:59.129 --> 31:01.234
the outbreak is over.

31:01.298 --> 31:02.834
But look around us.

31:02.899 --> 31:05.379
<i>Look what we do every day.</i>

31:05.435 --> 31:07.847
It only takes one.

31:07.904 --> 31:12.478
One uncontained bite
can trigger another massive outbreak.

31:12.542 --> 31:15.523
İt's only a matter of time.

31:15.579 --> 31:18.560
You know why'?

31:18.615 --> 31:20.788
Because we're stuck with being human.

31:24.421 --> 31:28.301
These... things are getting smarter.

31:28.358 --> 31:30.634
Hey, camera boy, come here.

31:30.694 --> 31:32.605
Check this shit out.

This whole things gonna end
us dead and gone...

31:44.508 --> 31:47.011
and these... things...

31:47.077 --> 31:50.889
Wandering around starving to death.

31:50.947 --> 31:52.949
So then why fight?

31:56.820 --> 31:58.891
Because we're human.

32:03.660 --> 32:07.233
<i>Re-N“ will return in a moment.</i>

32:54.878 --> 32:56.653

the Oklahoma school principal...

32:59.182 --> 33:01.822

33:04.621 --> 33:05.861
What a story.

33:05.922 --> 33:08.528
It-It all happened so fast.

33:08.592 --> 33:10.970
From-From What l, uh, can remember...

33:11.027 --> 33:13.132
um, l-l was telling the children
to get behind me...

33:13.196 --> 33:17.008
and, uh, luckily, a-a bat had dropped...

33:17.067 --> 33:20.480
from-from two of the children
who had been playing a little ball.

33:20.537 --> 33:23.245
And l, uh, grabbed that and, uh...

33:23.306 --> 33:25.308
I kind of Went ballistic.

33:25.375 --> 33:27.286
And at some point, I remembered...

33:27.344 --> 33:31.087
“My God, the kids.
L-l dorft Want them to see this.”

33:31.148 --> 33:33.560
Well, l-l just-I just told them to-to run.

33:33.617 --> 33:35.927
L-l got in front ofthem and I guess, uh...

33:35.986 --> 33:39.160
there is something to, uh,
having a schoolteacher voice sometimes.

33:39.222 --> 33:42.829

they sent us out in hazmat suits.

34:08.685 --> 34:10.687
They used to slow us clown.

34:10.754 --> 34:13.701
The suits didrft protect you,
so they changed the rules.

34:13.757 --> 34:15.429
Now we can survive.

34:15.492 --> 34:19.201
But we still gotta go
through decontamination.

34:20.397 --> 34:22.342
Good day on the street.

34:22.399 --> 34:24.675
Yeah, I look over at you today
and I savv you...

34:24.734 --> 34:27.271
- Hey!
- Thump, thump, thump!

34:27.337 --> 34:29.578
It was-
crazy, man.

34:29.639 --> 34:30.947
You were a-
animal.

34:31.007 --> 34:34.545
- Did you see it explode?
- Awesome, man!

34:34.610 --> 34:37.319
- Come on.
- Love it.

34:37.380 --> 34:39.587
Most people dorft understand What vve do.

34:39.649 --> 34:41.286
Why would they?

34:41.351 --> 34:43.159
İt's tough. it's serious.

34:43.219 --> 34:46.929
You put yourself in harm's way.
It's stressful.

34:46.989 --> 34:49.800
Sometimes you gotta
let off a little steam...

34:49.860 --> 34:53.501
in What may seem a weird Way.

34:53.563 --> 34:55.634
- Yeah!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:55.699 --> 34:59.010
<i>Eve</i>

34:59.069 --> 35:00.810
Whoo!

35:00.871 --> 35:02.942
What do you do to blow off steam?

35:03.006 --> 35:05.919
I pray. That's just me.

35:11.781 --> 35:14.284
Hey, there, camera.
You guys out in the field too?

35:14.351 --> 35:17.457
- Uh, yeah, but we wererflt in-
- All right. Both of you, come on. Go.

35:17.521 --> 35:19.762
Yeah, R-Div’s a boys’ club.

35:20.557 --> 35:23.595
R-D! Oprah! VVhoo!

35:23.660 --> 35:25.230
Sure, um, well...

35:25.295 --> 35:28.504
you saw there's no separate facilities.

35:28.565 --> 35:32.570
Um, I heard I was
one of 121 females nationwide...

35:32.636 --> 35:37.142
but that was a While back, so by now some-

35:43.246 --> 35:46.455
Come here. He’s got
a scratch on his left arm.

35:46.516 --> 35:48.553
İt's nothing. I got it this morning.

35:48.618 --> 35:51.224
A door scratched me. Sarge, tell him.

35:51.288 --> 35:52.392
Sarge!

35:53.623 --> 35:55.830
Guys, come on. This ain't right.

35:55.892 --> 35:57.496
Come on. You know the rule.

35:57.561 --> 35:59.837
Twenty-four hours observation.
Lefs go.

36:01.097 --> 36:03.134
This is bullshit!

36:11.741 --> 36:13.186
What?

36:23.086 --> 36:25.999
Never had an infected in the building ever.

36:26.056 --> 36:28.662
I'm sure Officer Nguyerfs fine,
but safety first.

36:28.725 --> 36:31.262
We gotta do the checks.

36:31.328 --> 36:35.105
Truth is, we clon't know
how infectious it is.

36:35.165 --> 36:37.736
We know a bite can do it, but, um...

36:37.801 --> 36:40.680
What about scratches?

36:40.737 --> 36:43.479
On, uh...

36:43.540 --> 36:48.148
there's one thing about this war
that's different from the other oonfliots.

36:48.211 --> 36:50.953
There’s no scars on the veterans.

36:51.014 --> 36:53.324
Once you get out...

36:53.383 --> 36:54.691
you’re dead.

36:57.854 --> 37:00.357
- Are they sending us back out?
- I don’t know.

37:05.929 --> 37:09.138
Ain’t you gonna say nothing about this?

37:12.235 --> 37:14.579
Oh, yeah, great. That's what I thought.

37:16.606 --> 37:19.348
As a result of the truck drivers
you caught today...

37:19.409 --> 37:22.652
are we gonna go back out'?

37:22.712 --> 37:25.283
Sarge? Sarge.

37:25.348 --> 37:26.850
<i>What else you want me to say, man?</i>

37:26.916 --> 37:28.756
<i>They told me they were
DVD players in the back.</i>

37:28.785 --> 37:30.371
<i>You think I ‘m stupid, huh?</i>

37:30.384 --> 37:31.163
<i>That's all I Know.</i>

37:31.221 --> 37:33.360
<i>You know what / think is really stupid?</i>

37:33.423 --> 37:35.403
<i>Spending the rest of your life in prison.</i>

37:35.458 --> 37:36.960
<i>Your partner just told us...</i>

37:37.027 --> 37:38.547
<i>your destination was inside this zone.</i>

37:38.595 --> 37:40.666
<i>I need-I need-
I want immunity. Then I'll talk.</i>

37:40.730 --> 37:42.232
<i>Screw your immunity!</i>

37:42.298 --> 37:44.335
<i>Tell me why you were going there.</i>

37:44.401 --> 37:45.903
<i>You're looking at mandatory life in prison.</i>

37:45.969 --> 37:47.710
<i>- I don't know anything!
- Come on.</i>

37:47.771 --> 37:49.273
<i>You're carrying a truckload of re-animates.</i>

37:49.339 --> 37:50.841
<i>That's it. I'm throwing you back.</i>

37:50.907 --> 37:53.615
<i>- Everything you've given me is useless!
- Okay, all right.</i>

37:53.677 --> 37:55.884
<i>Ah, it's-it's something
called the Judas Project.</i>

37:55.945 --> 37:58.323
<i>The Judas Project? Tell me more about that.</i>

37:58.381 --> 38:02.830
Sergeant, these Re-Ans are
different, smarter, very dangerous!

38:02.886 --> 38:06.095
After discovering the truck
driveﬁs final location...

38:06.156 --> 38:08.158
Captain McAdams and the Sarge argue...

38:08.224 --> 38:12.036
over whether they should deploy
R-Division 8 deep into The Zone.

38:12.095 --> 38:15.770
That's it! Deploy now, Sergeant!

38:15.832 --> 38:17.470
Hey, get away from me, camera boy!

38:17.534 --> 38:19.810
My name's not camera boy. it's Jimmy.

38:21.604 --> 38:23.606
Jimmy was the name of his son.

38:23.673 --> 38:25.846
He died during the outbreak.

38:25.909 --> 38:27.582
What happened?

38:27.644 --> 38:30.318
You’re gonna keep pointing that
thing at me till I tell you, aren’t you?

38:30.380 --> 38:33.827
Uh, no way. I'm not going there.

38:33.883 --> 38:36.090
That's the Sarge's business.

38:36.152 --> 38:38.393
If you neecl to know, you'll know.

38:38.455 --> 38:44.269
Everyone on R-Div thinks the Sarge was a
cop or a soldier before the outbreak.

38:44.327 --> 38:47.365
They’re wrong. He was a
supermarket manager.

38:47.430 --> 38:50.900
Just doing What vve were told
to do when it started.

38:50.967 --> 38:55.279
Staying holed up in his house
with his Wife Ronnie and his kid.

38:55.338 --> 38:57.818
He was only three years old.

38:57.874 --> 39:02.380
They ran out of food, so he Went to the
store to get more and, um...

39:02.445 --> 39:05.915
when he got back,
his Wife was so badly eaten...

39:05.982 --> 39:07.791
she was gone.

39:07.851 --> 39:10.798
She was the lucky one.

39:10.854 --> 39:12.856
Jimmy vvasrft.

39:15.024 --> 39:17.766
He had to re-kill his ovvn little boy.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.844
Hi. We all remember the outbreak.

39:27.871 --> 39:29.214
The people we lost.

39:31.174 --> 39:34.018
Of course we'll never forget.

39:34.077 --> 39:37.923
But now we have to cope with the aftermath.

39:37.981 --> 39:40.860
At Gibsons Post Trauma Clinic,
vve understand.

39:40.917 --> 39:42.897
We know just talking isn't enough.

39:42.952 --> 39:46.195
Thafs why vve prescribe
the Widest range of drugs.

39:46.256 --> 39:49.328
No one prescribes harder, faster or more...

39:49.392 --> 39:50.894
even over the phone.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.439
Gibsorfs Post Trauma Clinic.

39:52.495 --> 39:55.101
Pain medication for emotional pain...

39:55.165 --> 39:57.441
the kind that really hurts.

39:59.636 --> 40:01.240
<i>Head shot.</i>

40:02.939 --> 40:04.213
<i>Re-K ill.</i>

40:05.875 --> 40:07.479
<i>Good aim.</i>

40:08.878 --> 40:11.586
<i>Well done.</i>

40:11.648 --> 40:14.891
|’ve tried other guns,
but I just never felt safe.

40:14.951 --> 40:17.090
<i>The Desert Eagle .50 caliber.</i>

40:17.153 --> 40:20.225
<i>The human skull is made of
16 joining plates of bone...</i>

40:20.290 --> 40:21.792
<i>some over an inch thick.</i>

40:21.858 --> 40:24.134
<i>- » Point, shoot.
- - Game over.</i>

40:24.194 --> 40:26.174
For the children.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.702
<i>Please have ID check ready.</i>

40:31.768 --> 40:35.272
<i>Stay inside your vehicle
unless instructed otherwise.</i>

40:43.079 --> 40:45.650
<i>R-D 8, proceed to zone
coordinates 1-5-niner-7—</i>

40:45.715 --> 40:47.661
All right, listen up.

40:47.717 --> 40:50.926
We got an address from the driver we picked
up from that truck.

40:50.987 --> 40:53.866
Something about some Judas Project.

40:53.923 --> 40:55.834
|t’s deep in The Zone.

40:55.892 --> 40:58.270
You gotta be kidding me.

40:58.328 --> 41:00.274
This is fantastic.

41:00.330 --> 41:03.072
A camera crevv’s never been
in The Zone before.

41:05.301 --> 41:06.939
I'm Jimmy Mitchell.

41:07.003 --> 41:09.711
And tonight vve have
an exclusive on Re-K/YL.

41:09.772 --> 41:13.948
That will be unlike anything
you’ve ever seen before on television.

41:14.010 --> 41:16.820
My camera crew and I are going to travel...

41:16.880 --> 41:19.952
with the brave men and Women
of R-Division 8...

41:20.016 --> 41:24.761
to an unknown point deep inside The Zone.

41:24.821 --> 41:28.268
As you may know,
The Zone is the sealed-off area...

41:28.324 --> 41:31.999
that encompasses most
of Manhattan Island...

41:32.061 --> 41:35.634
in the once proud city
formerly known as New York.

41:35.698 --> 41:40.408
In the dark and violent months following
the patient zero Re-An outbreak...

41:40.470 --> 41:44.145
New York was heroically
sealed off by engineers...

41:44.207 --> 41:46.915
in an unrivaled construction project.

41:46.976 --> 41:49.547
But no one, besides the military...

41:49.612 --> 41:53.287
has been allowed in this area
in nearly five years.

41:53.349 --> 41:56.922
During that time, rumors have spread Wildly
across the Internet...

41:56.986 --> 42:00.160
and several best-selling authors
have written books...

42:00.223 --> 42:05.673
speculating on What exactly
is going on behind these giant walls.

42:05.728 --> 42:08.902
The conspiracy theories
range from the mundane...

42:08.965 --> 42:11.912
to the outlandish.

42:11.968 --> 42:15.472
Now as you may know,
Re-Kfl/ is filmed live on a two-hour delay.

42:15.538 --> 42:17.779
This is especially necessary tonight...

42:17.840 --> 42:22.846
because communication will be completely
blacked out once vve’re inside these walls.

42:22.912 --> 42:25.984
So every two hours our Re-Ki/l drones...

42:26.049 --> 42:30.191
are going to rendezvous with us
and ferry our camera footage...

42:30.253 --> 42:32.699
back to our mobile broadcast studio...

42:32.755 --> 42:35.235
and then directly into your home.

42:35.291 --> 42:37.999
So sit back and be the first
to discover...

42:38.061 --> 42:41.008
What truly lies inside The Zone.

42:47.270 --> 42:50.911
Captain McAdams, can you tell us
a little more about The Zone?

42:50.974 --> 42:54.114
The, uh, Zone is, uh, part ofthe city...

42:54.177 --> 42:57.215
that vve never managed
to clear after the outbreak.

42:57.280 --> 42:58.782
So, for five years...

42:58.848 --> 43:01.556
we just built a wall around it...

43:01.617 --> 43:04.928
and, uh, let vvhafs inside rot away.

43:06.356 --> 43:07.596
Hopefully.

43:09.392 --> 43:10.996
So tell me, Winston...

43:11.060 --> 43:12.971
vvhafs your thoughts on The Zone?

43:13.029 --> 43:15.669
|t’s a no-marfs-land.

43:15.732 --> 43:17.905
İt's a place we, uh...

43:17.967 --> 43:21.471
had to contain after the initial outbreak.

43:21.537 --> 43:24.017
We had to wall it up, seal it shut.

43:24.073 --> 43:27.020
Now it's the Re-An ghetto.

43:27.076 --> 43:31.786
A few Weeks ago,
another R-D unit Went in there.

43:31.848 --> 43:33.418
No one came back.

43:37.854 --> 43:39.891
Hey, Parker,
have you been in The Zone before?

43:39.956 --> 43:42.664
Do I look that-
dumb to you?

43:42.725 --> 43:45.365
- Huh? Get the fuck out of here.
- No. Ovv! God.

43:45.428 --> 43:47.533
Do I know why we're here'?

43:48.498 --> 43:50.102
Dude-

43:50.166 --> 43:52.112
I'm just as blind as you are.

43:52.168 --> 43:54.671
- Except I got an M-16.
- You got a-camera.

43:54.737 --> 43:56.808
Nobody wants to be here, Jimmy.

43:57.673 --> 43:59.175
Nobody.

44:19.762 --> 44:22.436
- What the shit are we doing here, Sarge?
- There's been rumors...

44:22.498 --> 44:24.341
of something called a Judas Project-

44:24.400 --> 44:27.244
a re-animation experimentation-
going on in The Zone.

44:27.303 --> 44:29.681
Guy from the truck confirmed the rumors.

44:29.739 --> 44:31.776
What are they doing with them?

44:31.841 --> 44:33.912
That's what we're here to fincl out.

44:33.976 --> 44:35.887
You think this Judas Project thing is real?

44:35.945 --> 44:38.516
I read plenty of blogs about it.

44:38.581 --> 44:41.221
People say they’re
trying to create some super Re-An.

44:41.284 --> 44:43.195
Why would anybody wanna do that?

44:44.220 --> 44:45.699
Desperate times, desperate measures.

44:45.755 --> 44:49.703
And if ifs that big a deal,
why all six on our ovvn?

44:49.759 --> 44:53.605
I do know the Lord is ever
constant and vigilant.

44:53.663 --> 44:56.109
Should have picked Chino.

44:56.165 --> 44:59.112
I started out in a different unit-
R-Div 6.

44:59.168 --> 45:01.808
We were ordered
into The Zone six months ago.

45:01.871 --> 45:04.010
But I had the flu that day.

45:06.242 --> 45:09.052
I'm alive because
of the-flu.

45:15.585 --> 45:17.963
Keep it tight. Stay alert.

45:21.157 --> 45:24.536
- Turn that light out now.
- Oh, yeah. My bad.

45:30.933 --> 45:32.935
Anyone have anything?

45:40.843 --> 45:43.847
Fan out. Two to the right.
The rest of us straight ahead.

45:47.817 --> 45:49.888
What is this place?

46:26.222 --> 46:28.725
" [ Vomitin Am g1

46:28.791 --> 46:31.328
Hey, are you all right?

46:31.394 --> 46:33.465
Jesus.

46:34.363 --> 46:35.865
God.

46:35.932 --> 46:38.879
L-low long have these people been here'?

46:44.106 --> 46:46.484
- Guess ifs real.
- The Judas Project?

46:46.542 --> 46:48.044
We’re too late.

46:53.015 --> 46:54.551
Hey, you see this?

46:56.219 --> 46:58.825
Whafd I tell you, boy? Had to be the army.

46:58.888 --> 47:01.892
God, they must have hated <i>him.</i>

47:01.958 --> 47:06.031
They dorft hate. They eat.

47:06.095 --> 47:07.904
- You sure about that, Sarge?
- Lets move.

47:10.199 --> 47:12.839
We don’t know nothing
about What they think...

47:12.902 --> 47:16.111
or what it's like... to be one of them.

47:32.922 --> 47:35.027
Lefs not break formation.

47:48.704 --> 47:50.513
Sarge? Sarge.

47:50.573 --> 47:53.179
- What is it'?
- Um, I just-I saw something.

47:53.242 --> 47:55.313
- Where'?

47:57.947 --> 48:00.587
- Keep it together.
- Ah, yeah.

48:23.572 --> 48:25.279
Oh, Jesus.

48:29.779 --> 48:32.953
<i>It's Survival Week again here at ONC.</i>

48:33.015 --> 48:35.791
<i>And all this week we'll be sharing
unique stories of survival...</i>

48:35.851 --> 48:37.353
<i>from our viewers.</i>

48:37.420 --> 48:40.492
<i>We wanna know where you were
when the outbreak ﬁrst began.</i>

48:53.369 --> 48:55.815
Where was I the day of the outbreak?

48:55.871 --> 48:59.011
To tell you that, I have to tell you about
Amos. Uh, that's my stepclacl.

48:59.075 --> 49:01.351
Proud owner of Amos Trees, LLC.

49:04.013 --> 49:05.583
He’s a piece of vvork.

49:05.648 --> 49:07.594
He was just always riding me, you know?

49:07.650 --> 49:09.357
“Ellis, what the hell's wrong with you?”

49:09.418 --> 49:11.796
“Ellis, why are you so lazy?”
“Ellis, vvhafs your problem?”

49:11.854 --> 49:13.925
“Ellis, you on— drugs?
Your body is a temple...

49:13.989 --> 49:16.162
and you’re ruining your-temple,
god-.”

49:16.225 --> 49:18.364
One of those religious types.

49:18.427 --> 49:19.929
So anyway, day of the outbreak...

49:19.995 --> 49:24.205
I'm-I'm out here doing my thing,
minding my own business.

49:24.266 --> 49:25.768
And here comes Amos stumbling up to me.

49:25.835 --> 49:27.781
I just thought he was drunk again.

49:27.837 --> 49:29.874
The old man had
a little thing for the sauce.

49:29.939 --> 49:31.850
“Your body’s a temple.”

49:31.907 --> 49:35.047
Anyway, so |’m out here.
He stumbles up and he tries to grab me.

49:35.111 --> 49:38.820
And l gotta tell you vve-vve dorft really
have that kind of, uh, relationship.

49:38.881 --> 49:41.293
I'm like, “Whoa,” you know.
“What the hell's your problem?”

49:41.350 --> 49:43.387
Then he tries to bite me.

49:44.553 --> 49:46.191
I was like,
“Oh, hell no,” you know?

49:46.255 --> 49:48.599
So I took a shovel to him hard, real hard.

49:48.657 --> 49:51.968
And, uh, it didrft seem to faze him.
It just kind of pissed him off.

49:52.027 --> 49:53.747
Anyways, that goes on for a little while...

49:53.796 --> 49:55.867
and luckily, I had old Johnny with me.

49:55.931 --> 49:57.535
And I Went at him with it.

49:57.600 --> 50:01.605
I cannot tell you What Went through my mind
when I Went at him with this.

50:01.670 --> 50:05.277
But, uh, I can tell you
What happened immediately afterwards.

50:05.341 --> 50:08.845
I just thought... I'm going to prison.

50:08.911 --> 50:13.223
But for once, uh, you knovv,
luck was on my side.

50:13.282 --> 50:15.421
Everywhere was going batshit crazy.

50:15.484 --> 50:18.522
So it kinda worked out
for me, uh, you know?

50:18.587 --> 50:22.399
I got the family business,
uh, changed the name.

50:22.458 --> 50:25.029
That's, uh-That's how
I survived the outbreak.

I know you’ve had to kill
a lot of your ovvn men on the field.

56:03.599 --> 56:06.603
Do you think if it was Parker,
you could pull the trigger?

56:18.580 --> 56:21.993
- Are you afraid to die?
- No.

56:22.050 --> 56:25.031
If you had to go,

56:29.358 --> 56:31.133
L-low would you react?

56:37.299 --> 56:40.246
<i>Re-N“ will return in a moment.</i>

56:54.082 --> 56:56.961
VVhoo!

56:57.019 --> 56:58.054
Yeah!

56:58.120 --> 57:00.066
Where was I on the day of the outbreak?

57:00.122 --> 57:01.624
Is that What you really wanna know?

57:01.690 --> 57:03.795
Can you please just answer the question?

57:03.859 --> 57:08.433
On the day of the outbreak, I was on
a date with a friend, my boyfriend.

57:08.497 --> 57:12.639
And dinner must have gone vvell
because he got us a room at a hotel-

57:12.701 --> 57:14.203
a really nice hotel.

57:14.269 --> 57:16.545
So vve Walk into the room,
and John, my boyfriend...

57:16.605 --> 57:18.107
starts acting really aggressive.

57:18.173 --> 57:20.779
And this somehow led to
a fight about money.

57:20.843 --> 57:22.982
Couples fight all the time
about money, right?

57:23.045 --> 57:26.026
So anyway,
he just looked around like he was lost.

57:26.081 --> 57:27.754
It was really Weird.

57:27.816 --> 57:29.693
I was having a hard time
taking him serious...

57:29.751 --> 57:31.526
because he’s not wearing pants.

57:31.587 --> 57:34.659
So I start laughing. Thafs when he decided
to put his hands on me...

57:34.723 --> 57:36.498
which is a huge no-no.

57:36.558 --> 57:38.162
I know exactly Where to kick.

57:38.227 --> 57:40.229
- I mentioned he wasn't wearing pants'?
- Yes.

57:40.295 --> 57:43.174
Hmm. Anyways, sol kick him,
and there’s zero response.

57:43.232 --> 57:45.678
- So then I show him this.
- She’s got a gun.

57:45.734 --> 57:47.338
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

57:47.402 --> 57:49.143
Do you Want me to finish my story or not?

57:49.204 --> 57:51.206
Cherry interview, take two.

57:51.273 --> 57:54.117
- Anyway, so then I tell Jim-
- John.

57:54.176 --> 57:58.647
Yes. Then I tell John to back the “F” off
me. You know What I mean?

57:58.714 --> 58:01.354
So he lunges at me,
so I shot him in the ass.

58:01.416 --> 58:04.556
I mean, that should have been enough
to stop him, but he just goes psycho.

58:04.620 --> 58:06.361
So I take off running clown the hallway.

58:06.421 --> 58:09.891
|’m screaming my head off,
and this little old Woman comes out...

58:09.958 --> 58:11.665
and John attacks her instead of me.

58:11.727 --> 58:13.502
No. So I Went up to him.

58:13.562 --> 58:15.838
I put the gun to the back
of his head and boom!

58:15.898 --> 58:18.242
And that fixed it.

58:18.300 --> 58:22.646
But then the old lady started
kind of looking weird and-

58:22.704 --> 58:24.183
No. Good-bye. I gotta go.

58:24.239 --> 58:26.082
So I reached clown. I grab his keys.

58:26.141 --> 58:28.121
He has a really nice car, by the Way.

58:28.176 --> 58:29.814
And I got the hell out ofthere.

58:29.878 --> 58:32.038
That's what happened to me
on the clay of the outbreak.

58:32.981 --> 58:35.723
Fifty dollars, right? Yeah?

59:09.685 --> 59:11.631
Welcome back to Re-Ki/l

59:19.461 --> 59:22.999
Trent Parker and Corporal Adams.

59:25.133 --> 59:27.545
It seems to be quiet.

59:27.602 --> 59:29.343
Quiet is good.

59:42.651 --> 59:43.823
Ankle biters.

59:46.655 --> 59:48.532
All right, spread out.

59:48.590 --> 59:52.732
Um, “Ankle biters” is a slang term...

59:52.794 --> 59:58.506
used by the R-Div team,
referring to Re-An children.

01:00:01.903 --> 01:00:04.144
Oh, this is not good.

01:00:04.206 --> 01:00:06.982
This is fucked up.

01:00:19.354 --> 01:00:21.265
You got something?

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:26.962

01:00:43.345 --> 01:00:46.519

01:01:29.091 --> 01:01:33.039

01:04:18.927 --> 01:04:22.636
Just get back. Get back! Move!

01:04:22.697 --> 01:04:25.234
- Run!
- Stairs! Go!

01:04:27.002 --> 01:04:28.504
Lefs move!

01:04:30.238 --> 01:04:33.515
Come on! Lefs go!

01:04:33.575 --> 01:04:35.782
Hernandez, go! Come on!

01:04:35.844 --> 01:04:38.381
L_et's go!

01:04:38.446 --> 01:04:39.948
Right behind you.

01:05:03.004 --> 01:05:05.211
Go, go, go!

01:05:05.273 --> 01:05:07.344
Come on! Go!

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:13.721
They’re still coming.

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:30.432
Die!

01:05:30.498 --> 01:05:32.136
This way!

01:05:36.538 --> 01:05:39.246
- Reload! Cover me.
- Got your six!

01:05:39.307 --> 01:05:40.877
RPG!

01:05:43.044 --> 01:05:45.615
Move, move, move,
move, move! Lefs go!

01:05:49.551 --> 01:05:51.053
Watch it! Got it!

01:05:52.954 --> 01:05:54.456
Come on! Go, go, go, go, go!

01:05:54.522 --> 01:05:57.025
Sarge, the dooﬁs locked!

01:05:57.092 --> 01:05:58.662
Move it, Matthews!

01:06:00.295 --> 01:06:01.865
My God, vve’re trapped.

01:06:12.907 --> 01:06:14.409
Sarge, what-what are you doing?

01:06:14.476 --> 01:06:16.513
Why are you taking your gear off?

01:06:16.578 --> 01:06:19.252
- In case they get us.
- So we're not bulletproof.

01:06:21.583 --> 01:06:24.496
- What about Jimmy'?
- <i>I'll</i> take oare of the camera guys.

01:06:32.394 --> 01:06:34.032
It's Hernandez.

01:06:37.432 --> 01:06:38.877
Sorry, man.

01:06:41.302 --> 01:06:43.612
Wait! NO!

01:06:56.217 --> 01:06:57.924
- Where we going?
- Gotta keep moving.

01:06:59.587 --> 01:07:02.329
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:05.860
That was Judas Project. Dumb assholes.

01:07:05.927 --> 01:07:08.373
Thought they had answers.
Thought they vvere gonna save the World.

01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:10.432
- What are you talking about?
- What were they doing in there?

01:07:10.498 --> 01:07:11.909
You know What? I dorft even know.

01:07:11.966 --> 01:07:13.775
I was just another grunt to them, you know?

01:07:13.835 --> 01:07:15.610
Save-the-vvorld types.

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:18.241
Scientists. Fuckheads, all ofthem.

01:07:18.306 --> 01:07:21.651
Come on! Come!
Lefs fucking move! Move! Now!

01:07:21.709 --> 01:07:25.418
In fucking here! Lefs go!
Go, go, go! Come on!

01:07:26.147 --> 01:07:28.627
Go on. Go, go.

01:07:28.683 --> 01:07:30.424
Go!

01:07:30.485 --> 01:07:32.487
Go, go, go, go. Come on, come on.

01:07:36.024 --> 01:07:39.904
That-That's all that's
left of the Judas Project.

01:07:39.961 --> 01:07:44.569
Maybe someday somebody will find it,
Work it out.

01:07:44.632 --> 01:07:48.842
All they told me one time was, uh, to be-

01:07:50.572 --> 01:07:53.314
To try to find a Way
to make ‘em turn on each other.

01:07:53.374 --> 01:07:57.049
Here.
To fight each other instead of us.

01:07:57.111 --> 01:07:59.455
Eat each other like they eat us?

01:07:59.514 --> 01:08:01.516
One clay we got a new batch.

01:08:01.583 --> 01:08:03.426
And one of them-He was different.

01:08:03.485 --> 01:08:05.931
<i>Subject is still unresponsive.</i>

01:08:06.955 --> 01:08:09.629
<i>I'm cutting the skin tissue.</i>

01:08:13.428 --> 01:08:15.066
They all changed.

01:08:15.129 --> 01:08:18.542
Uh, the Way they acted,
the Way they watched us.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.102
They changed.

01:08:20.167 --> 01:08:22.910
They started acting like,
uh-in a group. Like they had ideas.

01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:24.917
I clon't know how to say it.

01:08:24.973 --> 01:08:28.216
I'm not an eggheacl or a scientist.
Just doing my job.

01:08:28.276 --> 01:08:29.812
What was your job?

01:08:29.877 --> 01:08:32.118
- I worked in the holding pens.
- Holding pens?

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:33.682
Oh, yeah.

01:08:36.216 --> 01:08:37.787
We had hundreds.

01:08:37.852 --> 01:08:40.332
Locked them all up together.

01:08:40.388 --> 01:08:43.198
- That was our big mistake.
- What happened?

01:08:43.258 --> 01:08:45.067
<i>Levels are spiking.</i>

01:08:47.028 --> 01:08:49.099
When did this happen?

01:08:49.162 --> 01:08:53.475
I uh-I kinda lost track of time,
but, uh, two weeks ago now.
J.

01:08:53.535 --> 01:08:55.207
Three.

01:08:55.270 --> 01:08:57.511
Mm. Maybe four Weeks.

01:08:57.572 --> 01:08:59.448
L-low come nobody knows about this'?

01:08:59.506 --> 01:09:01.645
'Cause they're smart enough to sit tight.

01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:04.553
The longer they stay here,
the bigger their army gets.

01:09:04.612 --> 01:09:07.218
You know, the more Re-Ans
get delivered in the trucks.

01:09:07.282 --> 01:09:09.319
- Army?
- Oh, yeah.

01:09:09.384 --> 01:09:11.125
Army of the dead.

01:09:11.185 --> 01:09:14.928
We’re no longer top ofthe food chain.
We’re food.

01:09:18.626 --> 01:09:20.264
Why are you still filming this?

01:09:20.328 --> 01:09:22.604
We’re gonna die here.
No one’s ever gonna see this.

01:09:22.663 --> 01:09:24.200
No, that's-that's not true...

01:09:24.265 --> 01:09:25.801
because every time we go outside...

01:09:25.867 --> 01:09:28.973
the network sends drones
so we can upload the files.

01:09:29.037 --> 01:09:30.948
- If we can just get out there-
- l-low far behind are they'?

01:09:31.005 --> 01:09:34.111
- Uh, about two hours.
- Then we still got a chance.

01:09:34.175 --> 01:09:36.086
We gotta let people know. Come on!

01:09:38.813 --> 01:09:41.191
- Hovv far do these tunnels go?
- Uh, forever.

01:09:41.249 --> 01:09:43.991
I think they link up
with the subway somewhere.

01:09:47.522 --> 01:09:49.229
Every-fucking-vvhere.

01:09:51.125 --> 01:09:53.867
Not a good fucking place.

01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:56.340
- What do you mean?
- They come out of here.

01:09:56.397 --> 01:09:58.775
Fucking anywhere. They are like wolves.

01:09:58.833 --> 01:10:01.939
They hunt in a pack. Hunting.

01:10:02.003 --> 01:10:03.607
Then let's make this quick.

01:10:03.671 --> 01:10:05.412
This is a bad place, man.

01:10:05.473 --> 01:10:08.181
They'll come out of fucking anywhere, man.

01:10:08.242 --> 01:10:10.916
- Tunnel dwellers.
- Tunnel dwellers?

01:10:10.979 --> 01:10:14.392
They’re hunting us here, and this is their
fucking hunting ground right here.

01:10:14.449 --> 01:10:16.986
See this? See this?

01:10:17.051 --> 01:10:19.725
Those fuckers will come out of there, man,
like water.

01:10:19.787 --> 01:10:22.495
They just ooze out of that fucker, man.

01:10:22.557 --> 01:10:26.300
- Hovv did you survive?
- I guess I was born lucky.

01:10:35.403 --> 01:10:38.646
Oh, God. Oh!

01:10:38.706 --> 01:10:42.153
Oh, God.

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:44.190
Whafd I fucking tell you?

01:10:44.245 --> 01:10:47.055
- A lucky-|’m a lucky fucker.
- Yeah.

01:10:47.115 --> 01:10:48.617
There’s one.

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.831
There’s one.

01:10:53.888 --> 01:10:57.131
Okay, vve’ve made it through the tunnels.

01:10:57.191 --> 01:10:59.296
Now we're on our way
to try ancl film some footage...

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.533
of the so-called Re-Animate army.

01:11:01.596 --> 01:11:04.372
This is wrong. This is fucking wrong.

01:11:06.034 --> 01:11:07.638
In there.

01:11:07.702 --> 01:11:09.739
They’re-They’re in there.

01:11:11.305 --> 01:11:14.184
You see 'em, huh'? Can you see 'em'?

01:11:14.242 --> 01:11:16.051
Can you see 'em'?

01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:17.987
What are they doing?

01:11:23.451 --> 01:11:24.953
That's the one. Fucking move.

01:11:25.019 --> 01:11:26.293
- What?
- Move.

01:11:26.354 --> 01:11:27.799
- What is it'?
- That's Elvis.

01:11:27.855 --> 01:11:28.438
Elvis'?

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:30.233
That's what we call him.
You know, like the King'?

01:11:30.291 --> 01:11:33.761
Soon as he showed up,
they all changed. They all fucking changed.

01:11:33.828 --> 01:11:37.071
Like they found themselves a leader.
An alpha male.

01:11:37.131 --> 01:11:40.169
- Where did it come from?
- I dorft fucking know.

01:11:40.234 --> 01:11:42.544
We need to get closer,
find out vvhafs going on.

01:11:42.603 --> 01:11:44.708
No, no, no, we oarTt. We oarTt.

01:11:44.772 --> 01:11:48.481
- Hey. We need to find a Way.
- Fucking crazy.

01:11:48.543 --> 01:11:50.045
We’re following Sarge in...

01:11:50.111 --> 01:11:52.614
to try and get a better shot
ofthe Re-An army...

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:55.524
to show the world vvhafs happening in here.

01:11:57.919 --> 01:12:00.126
This is crazy. We’re too close.

01:12:00.188 --> 01:12:01.690
You said vve gotta show people.

01:12:01.756 --> 01:12:03.258
- Yeah, but-
- Listen.

01:12:03.324 --> 01:12:07.136
We shoot it all with one camera,
fight our way back to our APO.

01:12:07.195 --> 01:12:08.765
You guys can broadcast from there, right?

01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:10.332
Yeah, yeah. We can upload it.

01:12:10.398 --> 01:12:12.344
Your APCJs too far. We'll never get there.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.313
Then vve’|| go back to your hole and Wait
for the network teams.

01:12:17.872 --> 01:12:20.250
There’s a catwalk up here.

01:12:20.308 --> 01:12:22.481
You'll be able to see
everything from there.

01:12:22.543 --> 01:12:24.045
All right, let's go.

01:12:51.305 --> 01:12:54.650
- I'm gonna go get the shot.
- Bobby's getting the shot.

01:12:58.513 --> 01:12:59.548
Shit.

01:13:02.984 --> 01:13:04.986
There's thousands of 'em.

01:13:06.954 --> 01:13:10.128
Bobby! No! Shit! Bobby!

01:13:10.191 --> 01:13:12.535
On, no!

01:13:16.964 --> 01:13:18.307
Bobby!

01:13:18.366 --> 01:13:20.277
We gotta move. Go, go! Come on! Lefs move!

01:13:20.334 --> 01:13:22.007
Shit!

01:13:22.069 --> 01:13:24.345
Come on! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:13:26.007 --> 01:13:28.283
Come on, come on!

01:13:28.342 --> 01:13:29.844
Move it!

01:13:33.381 --> 01:13:35.190
Come on! God!

01:13:37.051 --> 01:13:39.327
Go, go, g0, 90, 9O, 9O, 9O!

01:13:43.224 --> 01:13:44.726
Come on!

01:13:44.792 --> 01:13:47.466
Head for the building right there!

01:13:49.330 --> 01:13:51.241
They’re catching up!

01:13:52.767 --> 01:13:55.509
Jimmy, Jimmy! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:14:04.078 --> 01:14:06.615
Sarge! Easy out! Come on!

01:14:06.681 --> 01:14:08.422
Sarge, easy out!

01:14:13.821 --> 01:14:15.732
Oh, my God.

01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:17.292
L_et's go!

01:14:38.045 --> 01:14:39.547
In there.

01:14:57.965 --> 01:14:59.467
Jesus.

01:15:01.369 --> 01:15:03.645
There’s thousands of them.

01:15:05.239 --> 01:15:06.741
This is it.

01:15:07.642 --> 01:15:09.349
Outbreak Two.

01:15:11.112 --> 01:15:13.956
I didrft think it’d come this fast.

01:15:14.015 --> 01:15:16.552
Come on, Sarge. We can make it out of here.

01:15:19.854 --> 01:15:21.356
Sarge.

01:15:21.422 --> 01:15:24.266
I dorft know if anyone will ever see this.

01:15:24.325 --> 01:15:27.397
But if you do...

01:15:27.461 --> 01:15:28.963
I'm sorry.

01:15:37.672 --> 01:15:39.583
- Sarge-

01:15:41.075 --> 01:15:42.577
Come on.

01:15:44.111 --> 01:15:45.613
Lefs go.

01:15:52.753 --> 01:15:54.255
Oh, God.

01:15:54.322 --> 01:15:56.324
It's like a lab.

01:15:59.694 --> 01:16:02.072
That door downstairs is never gonna hold.

01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:12.281
Why the hell haverft they eaten all this?

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.876
I dorft know.

01:16:22.416 --> 01:16:25.363
- Oh! Hey. You okay?
- Yeah.

01:16:25.419 --> 01:16:27.592
Oh, God!

01:16:34.095 --> 01:16:35.597
Sarge!

01:16:36.964 --> 01:16:38.409
Kill it!

01:16:41.702 --> 01:16:43.807
Find us another Way out!

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.483
Oh, God! Push!

01:16:52.346 --> 01:16:54.348
They’re getting in!

01:17:01.522 --> 01:17:03.024
Go!

01:17:15.903 --> 01:17:18.076
Sarge! Jimmy!

01:17:26.247 --> 01:17:28.227
Look out!

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.661
Get off her! No!

01:17:34.722 --> 01:17:36.326
Sarge!

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:38.370
Sarge, vve need help in here!

01:17:40.561 --> 01:17:42.063

01:17:43.531 --> 01:17:45.033
Get off her!

01:18:02.783 --> 01:18:04.694
Get off!

01:18:44.959 --> 01:18:46.905
What was Jimmy like?

01:18:46.961 --> 01:18:48.702
He was a great kid.

01:18:50.131 --> 01:18:52.611
What keeps you going?

01:18:52.666 --> 01:18:54.805
I mean, why you do this?

01:18:54.869 --> 01:18:59.011
I do this so no other parent...
has to do What I did.

01:19:01.408 --> 01:19:04.389
Do you ever think about dying?

01:19:05.846 --> 01:19:07.723
When my day comes...

01:19:09.383 --> 01:19:11.522
I finally get to go home.

01:19:14.889 --> 01:19:16.994
<i>Eve</i>

01:19:34.141 --> 01:19:38.920
Some religious scholars
believe that purgatory is a place...

01:19:38.979 --> 01:19:42.222
for souls that are equally balanced
between good and evil...

01:19:42.283 --> 01:19:44.388
and that your actions, they determine...

01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:48.558
whether or not you will go
to heaven... or hell.

01:19:51.192 --> 01:19:53.194
The jury’s out for you all.

01:19:54.128 --> 01:19:55.903
'Cause you are corrupt...

01:19:55.963 --> 01:19:58.705
by doing What you do with that lens.

01:19:58.766 --> 01:20:00.973
But then you know that. God bless you.

01:20:07.441 --> 01:20:11.150
We interrupt this program to bring you

Sean Griffin is on the scene.

01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:15.989
Mary, two weeks ago
we started getting reports...

01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:17.961
of re-animate attacks in the subway.

01:20:18.018 --> 01:20:21.431
And two days ago, they started coming up.

01:20:21.488 --> 01:20:24.935
Yesterday, the entire downtown area
was placed under quarantine...

01:20:24.992 --> 01:20:28.439
and the downtown barricade
here was erected.

01:20:28.495 --> 01:20:30.702
But now it appears
a large group of re-animates...

01:20:30.764 --> 01:20:33.267
is headed toward the barricade.

01:20:33.334 --> 01:20:35.371
Early estimates of the numbers-

01:20:35.436 --> 01:20:38.713
50,000 or more.

01:20:38.772 --> 01:20:41.776
There’s no way of knowing
ifthe downtown barricade can hold.

01:20:41.842 --> 01:20:45.688
It seems clear
that Outbreak Two is happening.
