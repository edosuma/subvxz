WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.264
Jake, what are you doing?

00:02.289 --> 00:03.479
Uh...

00:03.503 --> 00:04.558
Parenting...

00:04.583 --> 00:06.689
She could really be our birth mother.

00:06.715 --> 00:07.773
... it's a lot.

00:07.798 --> 00:09.607
I said I didn't know
where the father is.

00:09.632 --> 00:10.695
But I do know where he is.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.779
I just... I don't want him
to know where I am.

00:12.804 --> 00:13.998
Even as adults...

00:14.023 --> 00:15.818
This suitcase you got us,
not that great.

00:15.843 --> 00:17.577
Can you please listen?

00:17.601 --> 00:19.607
... we fall back into
the same patterns...

00:19.632 --> 00:21.830
Mom... She died, Pop.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.701
... and like any relationship...

00:23.726 --> 00:25.627
I was wrong. We can just be friends.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.232
I was just thinking the same thing.

00:27.257 --> 00:28.351
... you have to work at it...

00:28.375 --> 00:29.928
So, are you a musician, too?

00:29.953 --> 00:31.257
You ever hear of the Red Ferns?

00:31.281 --> 00:32.889
- ... find that common ground...
- Hello?

00:32.914 --> 00:34.514
Rome. Hey. Isaac Martin.

00:34.539 --> 00:35.827
You open to sending me your script?

00:35.851 --> 00:36.873
... and just try...

00:36.898 --> 00:38.873
I found those in the pink sleeping bag.

00:38.898 --> 00:40.100
... to keep your cool.

00:40.125 --> 00:41.518
You should have saved the pancakes

00:41.542 --> 00:43.561
in case Soph gets the munchies.

00:46.812 --> 00:48.890
I know what I'm gonna say.
Don't try to talk me out of it.

00:48.914 --> 00:50.021
What am I hearing?

00:50.046 --> 00:52.139
Are you going up stairs? Huh?

00:52.164 --> 00:53.404
You going to talk to Sophie now?

00:53.428 --> 00:55.217
Put me on speaker. I
want to be on speaker.

00:55.242 --> 00:56.407
No, I'm not gonna have you eavesdrop

00:56.431 --> 00:58.748
while I talk to my daughter
about finding her pot.

00:58.773 --> 00:59.904
Eh, you're right.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.287
- FaceTime?
- No.

01:01.312 --> 01:02.789
If this conversation is to go well,

01:02.813 --> 01:05.208
I have to send the message
that what she's done

01:05.232 --> 01:07.521
was wrong without scaring her off again.

01:07.546 --> 01:09.875
Everything's still... fragile.

01:10.554 --> 01:12.881
Ah. Sounds like
somebody could use a joint.

01:13.757 --> 01:15.051
Don't you have to get to work?

01:15.075 --> 01:19.006
Well, that is the beauty
of my new freelance gig, D.

01:19.031 --> 01:22.021
'Cause I'm working from home,
I'm already there.

01:22.046 --> 01:23.643
I don't even have to wear pants.

01:23.667 --> 01:24.968
Thanks for the visual.

01:24.992 --> 01:26.412
Not that I mind, but, uh,

01:26.437 --> 01:27.730
why are we whispering?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.654
'Cause I'm at her door. Bye.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.027
Hey, Mom.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.117
Forgot my sweater.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.865
Is everything okay?

01:37.889 --> 01:39.784
Yeah, I was wondering
if we could talk for a second?

01:39.808 --> 01:41.369
Yeah. Sure.

01:42.210 --> 01:44.414
Look, if the last few months
have taught us anything,

01:44.438 --> 01:48.232
it's that we need to be
honest with each other.

01:48.257 --> 01:49.648
Okay.

01:50.921 --> 01:52.873
I found something of yours.

01:52.898 --> 01:54.924
And I know that you're growing up

01:54.948 --> 01:56.676
and that your friends
are making choices...

01:56.700 --> 01:58.662
Okay. Uh... look, you know,

01:58.687 --> 02:01.435
I-I was gonna talk to you about this.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.807
Okay, good. I'm glad,
because we need to talk about it.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.310
Yeah, and... and the fact is...

02:05.334 --> 02:08.127
Is a lot of girls my age
are on birth control.

02:10.538 --> 02:11.733
- What?
- It's true.

02:11.757 --> 02:14.367
I mean, Jess has been
on it for like a year now.

02:16.179 --> 02:17.710
Are you and Jake having sex?

02:17.735 --> 02:20.787
No. No, look,
I-I just wanted to be ready.

02:21.146 --> 02:23.285
Okay. Okay.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.996
See, I knew you wouldn't understand.

02:25.021 --> 02:27.247
What? No. I might. I will. I might.

02:27.272 --> 02:30.154
I just... I-I don't want
to say the wrong thing.

02:30.179 --> 02:32.404
Let's just hit pause for a second, okay?

02:32.429 --> 02:35.414
Neither one of us has sex
for the next 24 hours.

02:37.351 --> 02:39.302
Ah. S-See? Word choice is everything.

02:39.327 --> 02:42.180
We'll just talk about it later tonight.

02:42.414 --> 02:44.296
Okay.

02:48.460 --> 02:52.718
Wow. That was a lot.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.600
Gary?

02:55.625 --> 02:57.576
For the record,
I wasn't eavesdropping, D.

02:57.601 --> 02:59.365
You just forgot to end the call.

02:59.390 --> 03:01.032
And you should think
about going on the pill, too,

03:01.056 --> 03:04.211
because you're screwed.

03:05.988 --> 03:10.867

03:11.608 --> 03:15.004
- I wasn't going that slow.
- That jogger ran right past us.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.298
Hey, I was protecting precious cargo.

03:18.187 --> 03:19.851
You know, you don't
have to keep driving me.

03:19.875 --> 03:21.115
I can take the T.

03:21.140 --> 03:22.887
- I don't mind.
- He does not mind.

03:23.346 --> 03:24.346
Okay.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.779
After you saw Derek's car...
We just want you to be safe.

03:27.804 --> 03:29.185
Thanks.

03:29.453 --> 03:31.104
- I'm gonna go punch in.
- Alright.

03:31.346 --> 03:32.742
Hey...

03:34.687 --> 03:35.942
Who is it?

03:35.966 --> 03:37.226
Isaac Martin.

03:38.101 --> 03:39.537
How you like that, huh?

03:39.562 --> 03:43.123
Big shot movie star calling
me on my personal cellphone.

03:43.148 --> 03:45.076
I mean, well, my only phone,
but the point is...

03:45.100 --> 03:47.161
The point is it's gonna go
to voicemail if you don't answer.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.371
Right, right, right.

03:49.559 --> 03:51.838
Hey, man. I was just talking about you.

03:51.863 --> 03:53.615
What's up, bruh?

03:55.277 --> 03:56.796
Uh-huh.

03:57.848 --> 03:59.418
_

03:59.443 --> 04:00.909
Yeah, I totally can.

04:01.918 --> 04:03.080
What is this?

04:03.105 --> 04:06.816
Oh. I've been looking at some classes.

04:07.236 --> 04:09.682
Always wanted
to go back to school, but...

04:09.707 --> 04:12.176
Derek talked me out of it.
He didn't think it was a good idea.

04:12.201 --> 04:13.744
Well, I do.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.190
Any idea what you want to study?

04:17.214 --> 04:19.026
Maybe social work?

04:19.050 --> 04:20.903
Seeing how much
the ladies at the shelter

04:20.927 --> 04:23.315
help people... I don't know.

04:23.340 --> 04:24.770
- It's probably dumb.
- Oh, yeah. Just tell your driver

04:24.794 --> 04:26.773
- it's off of that street.
- It's not dumb.

04:26.798 --> 04:28.359
Eve, it's great.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.037
Okay, okay.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.908
Try to stay calm,
but Isaac Martin is in town.

04:33.285 --> 04:35.626
Uh, he's got a couple hours
before he gets back to L. A.,

04:35.650 --> 04:37.963
and he wants to have lunch with me.

04:38.213 --> 04:39.213
Here?

04:39.238 --> 04:41.393
- Yes.
- Isaac Martin is coming here?

04:41.418 --> 04:43.479
Just checked my schedule,
and I'm... I'm free.

04:43.504 --> 04:44.969
Oh, man. I'm not free.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.619
I gotta cancel lunch with my dad.

04:46.644 --> 04:47.764
He'll understand. This is big.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.143
Well, he won't understand.
But this is big.

04:51.168 --> 04:53.143
Why does Isaac Martin want
to have lunch with you?

04:53.168 --> 04:54.254
- Well, that...
- Because he wants

04:54.278 --> 04:55.830
to star in Rome's movie.

04:55.855 --> 04:57.565
- Okay.
- Oh, my God. That's so cool!

04:57.589 --> 04:59.253
Okay, you know,
let's not get ahead of ourselves.

04:59.277 --> 05:00.777
He's probably circling
a ton of other projects.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.777
Is this shirt nice enough?

05:03.121 --> 05:05.990
I mean, Gina,
this shirt could change our lives.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.450
Is this shirt nice enough
to change our lives?

05:07.474 --> 05:10.703
I would like to introduce you
to Rome when he's stressed.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.497
Rome-when-he's-stressed, this is Eve.

05:12.521 --> 05:13.955
Yeah. I need... Excuse me, ladies.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.083
- Call your father.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.544
Okay, this is good. This is good, Colin.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.046
You've always wondered what Dad does

05:20.070 --> 05:21.631
to keep this roof over our heads,

05:21.655 --> 05:23.369
and now you're seeing it up close.

05:23.394 --> 05:25.468
I'm valuing this gentleman's life

05:25.492 --> 05:27.053
for a big ol' insurance company.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.736
Now, if I were to put
a price tag on your life,

05:29.761 --> 05:31.474
I would say priceless.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.892
Wouldn't change a thing.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.893
Stop drooling on my couch, please.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.550
What do we have here?

05:36.964 --> 05:39.732
Ted Murphy, age 56.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.443
56. God, that's so young.

05:42.738 --> 05:44.779
Sad, sad, sad.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.197
Am I talking to myself more than usual?

05:47.222 --> 05:49.200
That's sad, sad, sad.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.790
I gotta go to a coffee
shop or something.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.033
Who am I, Queen Elizabeth? Ugh.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.359
I mean, she's only sixteen.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.069
How is this happening already?

06:25.093 --> 06:27.864
Well, at least she's being
responsible, preparing.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.532
That's got to feel good, right?

06:29.556 --> 06:31.174
Best feeling ever.

06:31.199 --> 06:33.744
You know, he's eighteen.
He's got to be experienced.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.955
Okay, but the good news is,
Sophie's coming in

06:35.979 --> 06:37.808
for her shift soon, which means

06:37.833 --> 06:41.127
you can keep an eye on her
the whole time she's here.

06:41.152 --> 06:43.082
You know what? I trust her.

06:43.107 --> 06:45.380
It's just Jake that I don't trust.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.216
Which is why I asked him to come up here

06:47.240 --> 06:49.119
and do inventory all day.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.014
Jake. Hi.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.121
Hey.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.074

07:30.867 --> 07:32.367
Just give us a sec. We can play it back.

07:32.391 --> 07:33.929
No, I wanna go again right away.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.765
I think I could have hit
the chorus a little harder.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.475
Do you ever run out of energy?

07:38.633 --> 07:39.935
Hey, Trevor.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.229
Don't mind me. Just checking
in on my favorite new artist

07:42.253 --> 07:43.514
before my next meeting.

07:43.539 --> 07:45.483
Dude, I'm loving the new demo.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.234
The single... it's fantastic.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.279
I think we're gonna fast-track it
to get hype going for the album.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.349
Really? That is great.

07:52.461 --> 07:54.283
Dakota, you are killing it.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.618
Absolutely killing it.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.992
The new tracks are pretty good, right?

07:57.016 --> 07:58.452
Red Ferns and I are on a roll.

07:58.477 --> 08:00.109
Yeah, well, I'd love
to hear what you guys

08:00.133 --> 08:01.666
have been working on,
if you're up for it.

08:01.690 --> 08:02.958
Yeah.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.378
Cool. I mean,
we are still kind of tinkering with it.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.467
We're crushing it, is what we're doing.

08:07.492 --> 08:08.709
Let's play it for him.

08:08.734 --> 08:11.215
Oh, shoot. You know what?
I gotta jump to that other meeting.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.850
Maybe you could send me a link?

08:12.875 --> 08:13.930
You got it.

08:13.955 --> 08:15.471
I'll listen to it in the car,
and then I'll give you guys

08:15.495 --> 08:17.098
- a call later.
- Great.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.307
- Great.
- Great.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.670
Keep it up.

08:19.695 --> 08:21.242
Later, man. Thanks.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.975
Just put it on the menu.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.536
- Hey. Maggie.
- H-Hi.

08:29.561 --> 08:30.653
What are you doing here?

08:30.678 --> 08:31.779
I thought you had your big date today

08:31.803 --> 08:33.030
with that guy from that app.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.669
- What's his name?
- Larry.

08:34.693 --> 08:37.616
Yeah. I thought I would meet him
here so you guys can tell me

08:37.640 --> 08:39.285
if he looks like a
pathological liar or not.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.475
I mean, I can't tell.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.505
I don't think he does,

08:41.530 --> 08:43.332
but after what happened with Eric,

08:43.356 --> 08:44.959
let's just say that my instincts

08:44.983 --> 08:46.544
haven't really been working for me.

08:46.569 --> 08:47.575
- Right?
- Ooh.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.213
I just feel like it's been four months
since Gary and I broke up.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.309
I need to get back out there,
rip the Band-Aid off.

08:52.334 --> 08:54.343
I mean, I'm young, attractive.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.304
Kate Winslet met her husband
fleeing a house fire.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.099
Yeah. And this is only
half as terrifying as that.

09:00.342 --> 09:01.434
It could be good.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.436
And we really want that for you.

09:03.460 --> 09:07.107
Yeah. But there's just one tiny problem.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.274
Oh, God. He's here already?

09:09.299 --> 09:10.584
Uh...

09:11.259 --> 09:13.112
Oh. Oh, no, no.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.321
There's something wrong
with him, isn't there?

09:14.345 --> 09:15.822
No, it's just...

09:16.401 --> 09:17.848
It's bad, isn't it?

09:17.873 --> 09:19.178
It's not great.

09:19.203 --> 09:20.452
What?

09:24.856 --> 09:26.381
Oh, God.

09:28.724 --> 09:30.506
What is Gary doing here?

09:33.132 --> 09:34.584
How about the one in the corner?

09:34.609 --> 09:36.715
No, I don't want him
to feel like I'm hiding him.

09:36.740 --> 09:38.179
How about this one right here?

09:38.203 --> 09:40.723
I don't want him to feel like
he's on display, you know?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.933
You should start thinking
of baby names now.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.517
Sorry.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.395
It's just...

09:46.419 --> 09:47.813
Do you know how many A-list writers

09:47.837 --> 09:50.371
are trying to get Isaac Martin
to do their movie right now?

09:50.396 --> 09:51.473
Yeah.

09:51.498 --> 09:53.152
But I bet he's gonna pick you.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.678
We'll see.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.947
I picked you, didn't I?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.299
This one's perfect.

09:58.324 --> 09:59.909
I'll move these out of the way.

10:03.248 --> 10:04.746
Dad, what are you doing here?

10:04.771 --> 10:06.665
I thought I told you
our lunch was canceled.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.642
You canceled lunch with you,
not lunch in general.

10:10.356 --> 10:12.134
Think I'll sit here.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.215
Unless...

10:14.239 --> 10:16.300
Did you cancel this table, too?

10:21.037 --> 10:22.993
He's not responding.

10:23.181 --> 10:24.406
What do I do?

10:24.431 --> 10:28.671
I cannot have my first date
since Gary be in front of Gary.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.046
Do you have his phone number?

10:30.071 --> 10:31.508
No. I don't even have his last name.

10:31.532 --> 10:35.392
I've just been messaging
him on this stupid, stupid app.

10:35.837 --> 10:37.929
Oh. I got it.

10:37.954 --> 10:39.615
You go on this date in front of my ex,

10:39.639 --> 10:42.540
and I'll go talk to Sophie
about sex and drugs.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.226
- Hey, Chef.
- Mm?

10:44.251 --> 10:46.038
If you need me,
I'll be upstairs doing inventory.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.498
Wait, wait, wait. What happened to Jake?

10:47.522 --> 10:49.179
I thought he was doing inventory.

10:49.204 --> 10:51.389
He wasn't feeling well,
so Albert sent him home.

10:51.414 --> 10:52.515
Okay.

10:52.540 --> 10:55.131
Tell him to, uh,
take all the time he needs.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.179
You know what? Gary
and I are both adults.

10:58.204 --> 10:59.979
I'm just gonna go out there,
and I'm gonna tell him

11:00.003 --> 11:01.923
what's happening, and he'll leave.

11:02.470 --> 11:05.057
- It's gonna be fine, right?
- Mm-hmm.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.083
- Yes.
- Because it has to be.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.044
Right this way.

11:14.806 --> 11:16.117
Whoa.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.570
Look who it is.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.195
Come on over. Step into my office.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.109
What brings you here? Oh, let me guess.

11:21.134 --> 11:25.244
Uh... D recruited you
to help convince Sophie

11:25.268 --> 11:27.695
that abstinence helps
the heart grow fonder?

11:27.720 --> 11:29.633
Um... actually, no.

11:29.658 --> 11:31.208
Ha! Poor D.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.050
I mean, she barely had time
to get over Danny's gay sleepover,

11:34.075 --> 11:35.378
and now this.

11:35.621 --> 11:36.986
Can I talk to you for a second?

11:37.011 --> 11:38.238
Sure.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.426
You seem taller.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.722
You almost go up to my breastbone.

11:43.504 --> 11:45.246
You're wearing heels.

11:46.731 --> 11:48.339
And you smell good.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.191
Are you meeting someone here?

11:51.871 --> 11:53.898
Margaret Bloom...

11:53.922 --> 11:55.689
do you have a date?

11:55.714 --> 11:56.901
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.760
Someone finally swiped right.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.854
- I know this is awkward.
- No. It's not awkward.

12:00.879 --> 12:02.698
Dating is rad.

12:02.722 --> 12:03.949
I don't know why I picked that word,

12:03.973 --> 12:06.150
but I do know you picked
the right place for it.

12:06.175 --> 12:07.453
Ambience. Check.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.135
Not too noisy. Check.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.479
Arugula salad. Both
low cal and delicious.

12:11.504 --> 12:13.254
I've been trying
to reach him so that we can

12:13.279 --> 12:15.161
meet up someplace else, but...

12:15.186 --> 12:16.771
Why?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.256
Oh. Ah.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.425
Should I go?

12:20.450 --> 12:22.121
Do you want me to go?

12:23.084 --> 12:24.832
Feels like I should go.

12:25.994 --> 12:28.431
N-No. No. You're all...
You're all set up.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.892
Don't leave on my account.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.227
I can stay.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.635
I mean, seems like
a normal thing to do, right?

12:34.660 --> 12:36.106
Stay?

12:36.130 --> 12:38.408
Sure. Eh, we're friends.

12:38.433 --> 12:40.580
- Doesn't have to be weird.
- It's not gonna be weird.

12:40.605 --> 12:44.439
I should, however, get back to Ted,
'cause he's my date.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.564
- Aw.
- Pulmonary embolism.

12:46.589 --> 12:48.285
Alright.

12:48.418 --> 12:49.816
Aah.

12:51.412 --> 12:53.081
Have a great date, buddy.

12:55.482 --> 12:58.426
So, guys, I am loving what I'm hearing.

12:58.451 --> 13:00.176
I already got that
bridge stuck in my head.

13:00.201 --> 13:01.465
Cool. Glad it's working.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.759
Oh, it's more than working.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.887
I did have a couple of thoughts, though.

13:07.029 --> 13:08.988
Sure. What were you thinking?

13:09.013 --> 13:10.747
Okay, so, right off the top...
The first verse.

13:10.771 --> 13:13.227
Should it be a little breathier?

13:13.435 --> 13:14.818
Breathier?

13:15.670 --> 13:17.105
What does that even mean?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.607
Could you be a little
more specific, Trevor?

13:18.631 --> 13:19.889
I-I don't know. It just felt like it

13:19.913 --> 13:22.786
was a little aggressive,
like you're hitting it too hard.

13:22.811 --> 13:24.474
That's the whole point.

13:25.185 --> 13:26.958
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean, what am I doing?

13:26.982 --> 13:28.284
Are you listening to this guy?

13:28.308 --> 13:29.910
I mean, I-I don't do breathy.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.954
I'm not that kind of singer,
and it's not that kind of song.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.301
We can at least try one
and see how it sounds.

13:34.326 --> 13:35.457
You guys still there?

13:35.481 --> 13:36.750
Totally.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.335
I guess we can do one a little softer.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.795
Great.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.020
Hey, how do you feel about
shortening the bridge?

13:43.045 --> 13:44.591
Oh, which bridge?
The one that you just said

13:44.615 --> 13:45.615
was stuck in your head?

13:45.640 --> 13:46.802
- What?
- Dakota.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.302
But the bridge is inspired.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.472
You go any shorter,
you'll strip the emotion out.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.142
Just tell him we'll take
a look at it and move on.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.762
- But why would...
- Nope.

13:54.787 --> 13:56.074
We will take a look at it.

13:56.099 --> 13:58.098
Yes, Trevor. Anything you say.

13:58.123 --> 13:59.189
Great.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.316
Now, hey, how married
are you to the chorus?

14:01.340 --> 14:02.925
Okay. I need some air.

14:04.085 --> 14:05.558
Everything alright?

14:05.591 --> 14:07.990
It's... Yes. Great.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.582
Can we call you back in a few minutes?

14:10.607 --> 14:12.953
Um... sure.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.830
Alright.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.591
Please, keep in mind,
as you meet my dad,

14:25.615 --> 14:28.010
you cannot change your mind
about giving us your baby.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.470
I'm sure he's sweet.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.805
Um, okay, he is, except...

14:31.829 --> 14:34.308
- He's not.
- He can be a titch cantankerous,

14:34.332 --> 14:36.727
and ever since Rome's mom died,
it's gotten a little worse.

14:36.751 --> 14:39.031
Oh, yeah. Understatement.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.125
These chairs are horrible.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.211
My left butt cheek just fell asleep.

14:47.236 --> 14:48.445
Well, wake it up, Pop,

14:48.470 --> 14:50.079
'cause we got someone
we want you to meet.

14:50.103 --> 14:53.035
Uh, Walter, this is Eve,
our birth mother.

14:53.290 --> 14:56.220
Hello. Heard so much about you.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.414
Look like you're ready to pop.

14:59.626 --> 15:01.047
You have her working here?

15:01.072 --> 15:02.878
It's not enough that
she's giving you her baby?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.344
You're also making her bus your tables?

15:05.369 --> 15:06.423
Don't worry about me.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.937
It's actually good
for me to stay active.

15:08.962 --> 15:10.094
Here. Let me freshen that up.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.758
With my future grandchild in that belly?

15:12.783 --> 15:14.348
I don't think so.

15:14.372 --> 15:15.974
You two are so alike.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.476
- No, we are not.
- I don't see it.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.117
What are you talking about?

15:19.142 --> 15:20.229
When I first met you at the diner,

15:20.253 --> 15:21.608
you wouldn't let me get
you coffee, either.

15:21.632 --> 15:22.859
That was totally different.

15:22.884 --> 15:24.031
Okay, that was a diner,

15:24.056 --> 15:26.110
not a restaurant, and you were seated.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.922
Now you're standing.

15:27.947 --> 15:29.613
- Gina, give me another one.
- No.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.970
We had to search for
that llama for 90 minutes.

15:31.994 --> 15:33.945
Jimmy, look, I told you not to have one

15:33.970 --> 15:35.578
at a kid's birthday party, anyway.

15:35.603 --> 15:37.844
And I told you to close
the gate on your way out.

15:37.869 --> 15:40.664
Look, I'm running in to meet a
guy about a movie I might do.

15:40.689 --> 15:41.917
We get it. You're famous.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.156
And someday, you will be, too.

15:44.813 --> 15:48.189
Trish, send Kimmel a dozen cupcakes
with my face on them.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.447
Got it.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.552
God, it is him.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.220
He looks smaller in person.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.888
Dad. Behave.

15:56.169 --> 15:57.558
Thank you, man.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.937
God. Hi. I've watched
all of your movies.

16:00.962 --> 16:02.938
- Can I get a photo with you?
- Uh, no pictures.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.571
Hey, stop. Of course.
Come on, bring it in.

16:04.595 --> 16:06.195
Okay.

16:06.220 --> 16:08.402
But do it in portrait mode. Come on.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.945
- Okay.
- Good.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.321
Good. Now a silly one.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.950
Rome, my man! What's up?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.563
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

16:16.587 --> 16:19.620
- You look good, man.
- Guys, this is great.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.477
Do you know how many
people are gonna post this?

16:21.501 --> 16:22.937
- All of them.
- Mm-hmm.

16:22.962 --> 16:24.835
Where's Sophie? She loves him.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.908
Oh, she called to
switch her shift to tonight.

16:28.016 --> 16:29.408
What?

16:30.704 --> 16:32.176
Oh, my God. Do you think she's...

16:32.200 --> 16:33.635
Yes, we think.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.845
She's with Jake.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.347
She's probably just bringing
him soup or something.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.008
Oh, Gina, wake up.
He's probably not even sick.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.945
They skipped out to have sex together.

16:41.970 --> 16:44.104
- Okay.
- You want me to handle this?

16:44.128 --> 16:45.898
Say the word. I will close up shop,

16:45.922 --> 16:47.476
and I will kill this kid.

16:47.501 --> 16:48.984
But forget that I said that,
'cause if I do kill him,

16:49.008 --> 16:50.370
I don't want it to be pre-meditated.

16:50.394 --> 16:52.862
- Gary, I'm gonna handle it.
- What are you gonna do?

16:52.887 --> 16:54.865
I'm gonna go to the office
and get his address,

16:54.889 --> 16:57.914
and then I'm gonna go to his
apartment and get my daughter.

17:05.012 --> 17:06.419
I got you.

17:06.935 --> 17:08.508
- Thank you, Isaac.
- You're welcome.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.733
How you doing?

17:10.759 --> 17:12.132
Oh, this is plush.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.635
Yeah. Best seat in the house.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.385
Well played.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.971
You gonna get Isaac's autograph?

17:18.570 --> 17:21.891
Uh, the only signed photograph
I have is of Henry Winkler,

17:21.915 --> 17:24.936
and nothing else is going on that shelf.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.396
Well, maybe your date
will be an Isaac Martin fan.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.233
Give you a nice little ice breaker.

17:29.258 --> 17:30.476
What's his name, anyway?

17:30.501 --> 17:31.835
- Larry.
- Larry?

17:31.860 --> 17:33.117
His name is Larry?

17:33.142 --> 17:34.613
Your name is Gary.

17:34.637 --> 17:35.948
It's different by one letter.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.200
And what an important letter it is.

17:38.415 --> 17:40.285
I'm kidding. I love the name Larry.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.578
Like Larry King.

17:42.376 --> 17:43.454
It's not Larry King, is it?

17:43.478 --> 17:44.977
'Cause that would explain why he's late.

17:45.001 --> 17:47.376
He's probably busy
divorcing one of his wives.

17:47.970 --> 17:50.820
I will leave you to it.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.674
Always a pleasure.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.935
Hey. What are you doing?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.539
We're in the middle of a notes call.

18:06.564 --> 18:08.480
Yeah, well, sorry
I didn't want to sit around

18:08.504 --> 18:10.274
and hear my album get trashed.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.609
Dakota, they're just notes.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.828
This is part of the process.

18:14.853 --> 18:16.415
Oh, just notes?

18:17.553 --> 18:19.783
You know what? Every person
I've met since I started this

18:19.807 --> 18:22.556
has tried to change me or control me

18:22.581 --> 18:24.912
or use me for something.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.898
I thought you were different,

18:26.923 --> 18:28.000
that you were on my side.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.961
I thought we were gonna make
my album, not theirs.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.088
You... You keep referring
to this as your album,

18:33.112 --> 18:36.216
but there is a whole team
of people working on this.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.823
- You know who's paying for them?
- Trevor?

18:37.847 --> 18:39.969
Yes. It's the same guy who's paying

18:39.994 --> 18:41.763
for this studio and who's
gonna be booking our tours

18:41.787 --> 18:42.848
once we're done.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.558
The minute you decided

18:44.582 --> 18:47.227
that you wanted to stop
making videos in your bedroom

18:47.251 --> 18:49.104
and really start putting
yourself out there,

18:49.128 --> 18:51.664
this album stopped being just yours.

18:51.689 --> 18:52.816
Wow.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.610
You know, I thought I might
learn something from you

18:54.634 --> 18:56.778
about being an artist, Eddie,

18:57.025 --> 18:59.328
but you're not an artist anymore.

18:59.353 --> 19:01.783
You are just a washed-up yes-man

19:01.807 --> 19:04.603
who will do anything to stay relevant.

19:05.657 --> 19:07.650
I'm going home. I'm done.

19:09.294 --> 19:10.541
Thanks for making time, man.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.377
Bruh, stop. Thank you.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.463
You know,
I've been thinking about casting

19:14.487 --> 19:15.756
- for some of the other roles.
- Okay.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.216
Isaac? Sorry, Clark
needs to talk to you.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.337
The firefighter movie
is back on the table.

19:21.298 --> 19:23.807
So sorry, dude.
This'll only take a second.

19:23.832 --> 19:25.083
Oh, yeah.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.770
What's a man gotta go to get
a bowl of chowder around here?

19:29.794 --> 19:30.937
My waiter's gone AWOL.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.790
Maybe he went to get your chowder, Pop.

19:32.815 --> 19:34.590
From where? Maine?

19:37.635 --> 19:39.947
You gonna introduce me to Mr. Big Shot?

19:39.972 --> 19:41.823
Well, we're kind of in the
middle of something right now.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.767
Well, he seems like he's
in the middle of something.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.204
Doesn't look like it has
anything to do with you.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.872
Sorry about that.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.582
There's a movie the
studio wants to make,

19:50.606 --> 19:51.915
but it keeps getting pushed.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.868
Hey. Their loss, my gain.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.236
Isaac, this is my dad, Walter.

20:02.261 --> 20:03.636
No way.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.723
Nice to meet you, sir.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.697
Hey, you got a talented son here.

20:08.722 --> 20:10.893
That's what I hear.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.751
So, uh, what brings you to town?

20:14.776 --> 20:16.400
Press junket for a movie I made.

20:16.425 --> 20:17.791
- Press junket?
- Promotional stuff.

20:17.815 --> 20:19.939
- I'll explain it later.
- No, no, I get it.

20:19.964 --> 20:22.939
So, let me ask you this...

20:22.964 --> 20:26.243
What do you do when you happen
to promote one of the bad ones?

20:26.267 --> 20:28.056
Like that helicopter movie you made?

20:28.893 --> 20:30.736
My dad hated that one, too.

20:30.761 --> 20:32.801
You must've known it was a clunker
when you were shooting it.

20:32.825 --> 20:36.259
I know. You made that
one to pay for the mansion.

20:36.284 --> 20:37.478
- Am I right?
- Dad...

20:37.503 --> 20:40.006
Well, you never think
it's going to be a clunker

20:40.030 --> 20:41.540
when you're reading the script.

20:41.565 --> 20:42.892
You hear that, son?

20:42.917 --> 20:44.845
Ears working just fine, Pop.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.918
Isaac? Clark again.

20:46.943 --> 20:48.663
They're saying they
can move the dates now.

20:49.371 --> 20:51.057
One sec.

20:52.454 --> 20:53.940
Talk to me.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.495
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:57.819 --> 20:59.876
- Are you kidding?
- What?

20:59.901 --> 21:00.944
You really think it's a good idea

21:00.968 --> 21:02.743
to insult the guy who
wants to make my movie?

21:02.768 --> 21:05.323
He's out there debating between
producing my script

21:05.347 --> 21:06.950
or doing some big studio one.

21:06.974 --> 21:10.120
I swear, it's like, sometimes,
you don't want me to succeed.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.913
I was just having some fun with the guy.

21:11.938 --> 21:15.379
Dad, Mom might've put up
with your crap, but I won't.

21:16.217 --> 21:19.211
If you can't figure out a
way to support me for once,

21:19.236 --> 21:20.922
maybe you should just go home.

21:39.824 --> 21:41.534
Sophie?

21:45.034 --> 21:46.509
Mom?

21:46.534 --> 21:48.665
I didn't want to have to come here,

21:48.690 --> 21:50.535
but apparently this can't wait.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.287
- Mom, just...
- What part of our conversation

21:52.311 --> 21:53.684
did you not understand this morning?

21:53.708 --> 21:55.251
Mom, please!

21:56.732 --> 21:58.562
Something's wrong with Jake.

21:58.587 --> 22:00.092
What?

22:05.157 --> 22:06.782
I-I...

22:13.138 --> 22:14.351
What happened?

22:14.375 --> 22:16.414
I-I called him on my way into work,

22:16.439 --> 22:18.679
and he said he was gonna go
home and lie down for a while.

22:18.703 --> 22:20.703
- I'm fine.
- But... But he sounded weird

22:20.728 --> 22:22.383
on the phone, so I came here,

22:22.408 --> 22:23.827
and he was all pale and sweaty and...

22:23.851 --> 22:25.733
You're hot. Where does it hurt?

22:25.758 --> 22:27.068
It's my stomach.

22:27.093 --> 22:28.787
It... Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

22:28.812 --> 22:29.866
Honey, grab his coat.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.618
We're gonna take you to the hospital.

22:36.367 --> 22:37.820
30 minutes late.

22:38.758 --> 22:39.918
Goodie, you're back.

22:39.942 --> 22:42.467
Listen, this happens more
often than you think.

22:42.492 --> 22:45.365
No shows, or the photos don't match.

22:45.390 --> 22:48.193
What I'm telling you, Mags,
is that it's a jungle out there.

22:48.218 --> 22:50.647
We've all been there, okay?

22:54.957 --> 22:56.516
- Hi. Just one?
- Hey.

22:56.541 --> 22:57.834
I'm just gonna sit at the bar.

22:57.859 --> 22:59.861
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:03.679 --> 23:05.110
No, no, no. You just dodged a bullet.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.320
That guy definitely still
lives with his parents.

23:07.508 --> 23:08.822
Why are you still here?

23:08.846 --> 23:11.639
Ah. I was just taking a break,
but you're right.

23:11.664 --> 23:12.709
I should stay on task.

23:12.734 --> 23:14.286
No, I mean, why are you here?

23:14.310 --> 23:16.586
I asked you to leave an hour ago.

23:18.187 --> 23:19.272
No, you didn't.

23:19.297 --> 23:21.428
I asked you if I should leave,
and you said no.

23:21.453 --> 23:23.287
Well, I obviously didn't mean it.

23:23.312 --> 23:25.338
Well, you should...
you should say what you mean.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.593
Hey, why are you getting so upset?

23:27.948 --> 23:30.635
Because I'm humiliated.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.679
And the last person
I wanted to be humiliated

23:32.704 --> 23:34.243
in front of was you.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.029
Maggie.

23:45.945 --> 23:47.813
He didn't mean it.

23:49.438 --> 23:52.365
Rome's just stressed about this movie.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.806
Still no sign of Larry?

23:58.557 --> 24:01.143
Have a seat. I'll pour you some chowder.

24:03.280 --> 24:06.337
Look, she's green.
She doesn't know how notes work.

24:06.362 --> 24:07.797
She took them personally.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.966
Let's give her a beat to calm down,

24:09.990 --> 24:11.885
and I'll talk to her tomorrow.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.887
You know what, man? Between her tantrums

24:13.912 --> 24:16.960
and her attitude...
Honestly, dude, I'm done.

24:16.985 --> 24:18.516
Done? No.

24:19.001 --> 24:21.063
Trevor, you said
you were loving the demos.

24:21.088 --> 24:22.093
But that was all you.

24:22.118 --> 24:24.320
We were getting nowhere with
her before you came along.

24:24.345 --> 24:25.482
Trevor, please.

24:25.506 --> 24:28.398
Just give me one more chance
to get through to her, okay?

24:28.891 --> 24:31.938
Ugh. I think life's too short,
but whatever.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.962
I saw her that morning. She was fine.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.931
I didn't even kiss her goodbye.

24:39.188 --> 24:40.556
I mean, if she'd been sick or something,

24:40.580 --> 24:42.624
at least I would've had a chance to...

24:44.712 --> 24:47.963
Well, uh, as someone
who's had cancer twice,

24:47.987 --> 24:51.174
it may be a blessing
that she went so quickly.

24:51.408 --> 24:53.697
Sorry, I didn't know you were sick.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.887
I know I'm no fun to be with right now,

24:55.911 --> 24:58.598
so you don't have to sit with me.

24:59.150 --> 25:00.381
Oh, no. Actually,

25:00.406 --> 25:03.559
I am hiding out from my ex-boyfriend.

25:03.584 --> 25:05.730
It's not very mature
behavior for a psychologist,

25:05.754 --> 25:07.465
but it's the best I got right now.

25:07.490 --> 25:08.733
You're a shrink?

25:08.757 --> 25:11.350
I don't really love that term, but yeah.

25:13.095 --> 25:14.779
Now, you were right on the money.

25:14.958 --> 25:17.658
Okay. That scene at the game?

25:17.683 --> 25:19.953
Where Reggie breaks down
and gives that speech?

25:20.773 --> 25:22.205
Still gives me chills.

25:22.229 --> 25:25.941
- Me, too.
- I love how you show him struggling,

25:25.966 --> 25:27.836
how being depressed doesn't always mean

25:27.860 --> 25:30.084
you're lying in bed, curled in a ball.

25:30.424 --> 25:32.297
It's real. That's what it is.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.676
It's real. Sometimes people mask it,

25:34.700 --> 25:36.970
try to fool themselves and everyone else

25:36.994 --> 25:40.205
into thinking they're okay,
when really they're not.

25:43.362 --> 25:44.780
Am I right?

25:47.303 --> 25:48.512
Rome?

25:50.007 --> 25:52.610
I'm sorry, man.
I know you got a lot going on

25:52.634 --> 25:54.404
and you took time out on
your way back to L.A

25:54.428 --> 25:55.905
to meet with me, but I gotta go.

25:55.929 --> 25:57.240
My car's gonna be here,

25:57.264 --> 25:59.598
and then I'm heading
to the airport, and I'm gone.

25:59.623 --> 26:01.745
My dad is going through
a really tough time,

26:01.769 --> 26:03.762
and I gotta be there for him, man.

26:12.438 --> 26:15.443
Dad. Hold up. Dad!

26:16.366 --> 26:18.344
What are you doing out here?

26:18.368 --> 26:20.551
Don't you need to be inside
for your big meeting?

26:20.576 --> 26:22.015
Hold on, hold on.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.416
I'm sorry for what I said earlier, Pop.

26:25.891 --> 26:27.951
Well, I'm sorry, too.

26:29.365 --> 26:32.066
Your mom always knew
how to keep me in line.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.610
I know.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.740
I miss her.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.909
I miss her, too, Pop.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.119
And you don't have to
go through this alone.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.370
I'm here.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.663
And if talking to me is not enough,

26:45.687 --> 26:49.292
there are people you can talk to.

26:49.966 --> 26:51.377
What?

26:51.402 --> 26:52.862
Like a shrink?

26:53.904 --> 26:55.965
- Like your friend Maggie?
- Yeah.

26:55.989 --> 26:58.492
She could help us find
someone for you to talk to.

27:00.646 --> 27:02.680
Only to talk about Mom, though.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.974
Yeah. Of course, Pop.

27:04.998 --> 27:07.143
Don't worry. You're still a cowboy.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.418
Maybe.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.779
I'll think about it.

27:12.784 --> 27:14.294
Come back inside.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.537
Have a beer with your son. Come on.

27:18.262 --> 27:19.989
You know I was just
kidding before, right?

27:20.013 --> 27:21.866
Yeah, I know. I kid, too.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.082
I think Eve was right.

27:23.107 --> 27:25.566
You and me, we are a lot alike.

27:25.591 --> 27:27.630
I don't see it.

27:27.966 --> 27:31.459
And I'll call you with another
update as soon as we get one.

27:31.968 --> 27:33.388
Bye.

27:34.802 --> 27:36.910
Hey. That was Jake's dad.

27:36.935 --> 27:38.590
They're taking the next flight.

27:38.615 --> 27:41.261
They'll be here when
he gets out of surgery.

27:41.285 --> 27:43.004
Thanks for everything, Mom.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.806
People get their appendixes
out all the time.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.115
He'll be fine.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.668
Look, I know we still have to talk.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.701
There's just been
a lot happening, and...

27:54.326 --> 27:57.107
some of it's been super confusing.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.322
Jake told me he loved me.

28:02.052 --> 28:03.607
He did?

28:04.232 --> 28:05.630
When?

28:06.713 --> 28:08.431
Last week.

28:10.638 --> 28:14.426
And, you know,
I wanted to tell you right after.

28:14.451 --> 28:15.502
But...

28:16.667 --> 28:19.760
things have just been
so weird between us.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.041
I thought maybe you didn't want to know.

28:24.066 --> 28:26.555
Of course I want to know.

28:26.580 --> 28:29.690
I want to know everything
that happens in your life.

28:31.013 --> 28:32.557
Do you love him?

28:35.619 --> 28:37.377
Yeah.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.927
I really think I do.

28:41.227 --> 28:43.268
And, you know, that doesn't...

28:43.292 --> 28:45.092
mean I'm gonna do anything.

28:45.117 --> 28:47.399
I just wanted to be responsible.

28:47.424 --> 28:49.493
I mean, that's why
I got the birth control,

28:49.518 --> 28:50.914
especially after
everything that happened,

28:50.938 --> 28:53.135
you know, with you and Charlie. I...

28:53.650 --> 28:56.025
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

28:56.050 --> 28:57.112
It's okay.

29:00.197 --> 29:03.112
I'm glad that I'm your cautionary tale.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.179
I tried to hide my mistakes
from you for so long,

29:06.203 --> 29:09.039
but I want you to learn
from those mistakes.

29:11.129 --> 29:15.812
You know, I saw you be a strong,
independent woman today.

29:16.010 --> 29:19.619
But I also saw you were still
a girl who needs her mom.

29:22.432 --> 29:24.821
I just... I think in all the ways

29:24.846 --> 29:27.116
that you're trying
to figure that out, I am, too.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.533
I'm trying to figure out the best way

29:30.494 --> 29:32.299
to be there for you.

29:33.802 --> 29:36.369
I've never had a 16-year-old before.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.346
Did you love him?

29:43.673 --> 29:46.127
- Dad? Of course I did.
- No.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.283
Eddie.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.603
I did.

29:55.627 --> 29:59.494
I did, but what
I realize now is... is...

29:59.893 --> 30:01.799
we were both lost.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.854
So we leaned on each other.

30:05.619 --> 30:08.299
First as friends, and...

30:10.308 --> 30:12.328
then more, and it was...
It was a mistake.

30:12.352 --> 30:15.291
It was a-a terrible one.

30:16.432 --> 30:18.918
And even though we
have Charlie in our life

30:18.942 --> 30:23.205
and she is so incredible...

30:25.336 --> 30:27.554
... what Eddie and I did,

30:28.500 --> 30:32.694
it still fills me with so much regret.

30:32.719 --> 30:35.167
That's something I don't
ever want you to feel.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.803
It's wonderful that you and Jake

30:39.828 --> 30:41.897
have these feelings for each other.

30:41.922 --> 30:44.777
But you've just...
you've had to grow up so fast

30:44.801 --> 30:46.414
in so many ways,

30:46.438 --> 30:47.947
and I don't want an important decision

30:47.971 --> 30:53.619
like this to be just a
reaction to everything

30:53.643 --> 30:55.929
that you've been through this year.

30:56.844 --> 30:59.980
Look, I know it's...
It's a big decision.

31:01.336 --> 31:03.034
And I'll think about it.

31:04.501 --> 31:06.378
I promise.

31:12.813 --> 31:14.368
Okay, now...

31:15.624 --> 31:17.727
we have to talk about...

31:17.751 --> 31:20.480
those joints that you were hiding.

31:23.215 --> 31:27.675
♪ And I took way too long ♪

31:29.355 --> 31:32.492
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.550
Thanks for agreeing to meet me.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.439
Ah, nothing for me, thanks.

31:38.464 --> 31:40.374
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.502
Uh, is this gonna be a problem?

31:42.526 --> 31:44.069
Only if I order.

31:45.946 --> 31:49.008
Listen, I know you think
that I'm irrelevant,

31:49.032 --> 31:50.515
and maybe you're right.

31:51.159 --> 31:54.687
But I am the most relevant
person in your life right now.

31:56.312 --> 31:57.814
I believe in you.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.342
Probably more than the label,

32:01.367 --> 32:04.506
and maybe even more than
you believe in yourself.

32:05.374 --> 32:06.843
Why?

32:07.008 --> 32:09.037
Because you remind me of me.

32:09.062 --> 32:11.654
Sabotaging your career
'cause you're scared?

32:11.679 --> 32:13.398
I invented that move.

32:17.759 --> 32:21.601
You are so talented, Dakota.

32:25.853 --> 32:27.546
It's Christine.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.257
What?

32:29.492 --> 32:32.209
My name's not really
Dakota. It's Christine.

32:33.226 --> 32:34.498
Then why Dakota?

32:34.523 --> 32:36.359
I grew up there.

32:36.804 --> 32:38.162
North Dakota.

32:38.187 --> 32:39.859
I know, very original.

32:40.515 --> 32:44.186
Small town, more cows than people.

32:44.211 --> 32:45.867
You know, everyone...

32:46.342 --> 32:49.490
used to make fun of me
for making my videos,

32:51.389 --> 32:53.983
for thinking I could be someone.

32:55.659 --> 32:57.464
So I left.

32:58.108 --> 33:00.329
And if I fail...

33:03.857 --> 33:07.156
... no, I can't go home again.
I can't let them be right.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.922
So, let's prove them wrong.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.799
It's just that every
time I talk to Trevor,

33:11.823 --> 33:14.608
I walk away feeling like he's
gonna drop me any second.

33:14.633 --> 33:16.156
Okay, you know what?

33:16.578 --> 33:19.795
Let's play it like he
is gonna drop you.

33:19.820 --> 33:23.881
But before he does,
you get to make one album.

33:23.906 --> 33:28.941
One great album where we
listen to what everyone thinks,

33:28.965 --> 33:31.152
but only take the notes
that make it better.

33:31.453 --> 33:34.947
So that when everyone in
North Dakota hears that album,

33:35.274 --> 33:38.075
they will know that you are someone.

33:45.320 --> 33:47.834
Hey, listen, uh, I'm sorry.

33:48.092 --> 33:50.219
You're right. I should've left.

33:50.987 --> 33:53.264
If I'm being totally honest,
there's a small part of me

33:53.289 --> 33:55.301
that was hoping this would go horribly,

33:55.325 --> 33:57.470
and I wanted to be here to see that.

33:57.617 --> 34:00.351
Well, glad it worked out for you.

34:01.510 --> 34:02.992
Maggie.

34:04.770 --> 34:06.770
- What's this?
- It's from Larry.

34:07.099 --> 34:08.099
What?

34:08.123 --> 34:09.398
No. Really?

34:09.422 --> 34:11.545
Yeah. He just called

34:11.570 --> 34:13.444
and asked us to send
over a bottle of wine,

34:13.467 --> 34:15.420
um, with his apologies.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.533
It's not as good as actually
showing up for the date,

34:19.556 --> 34:21.409
but that is a screw top.

34:21.434 --> 34:22.599
Very classy.

34:22.623 --> 34:24.288
I mean, it is kind of weird.

34:24.312 --> 34:27.123
He sends me wine,
but he still hasn't contacted me.

34:27.148 --> 34:29.377
Well, actions speak louder
than words, right?

34:29.400 --> 34:30.833
At least he reached out.

34:30.859 --> 34:32.338
- Hm.
- Gary.

34:32.362 --> 34:34.547
- What?
- You sent the wine, didn't you?

34:34.572 --> 34:36.007
I s... No.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.469
What is that? A Chardonnay?

34:38.493 --> 34:40.436
I happen to know that
you love a pinot noir.

34:40.460 --> 34:41.587
Gary.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.248
Why did you send the wine?

34:45.274 --> 34:46.317
I...

34:48.734 --> 34:50.123
Okay.

34:51.109 --> 34:54.179
Gina sent the wine.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.265
I did.

34:58.999 --> 35:01.534
Okay, I-I sent it because I
didn't want you to feel bad

35:01.558 --> 35:03.585
because some jerk didn't show up.

35:04.677 --> 35:06.718
Well, thank you.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.792
And I'm sorry. I don't
know why I thought...

35:09.816 --> 35:11.460
Ah, it just means I know you
way better than she does.

35:11.484 --> 35:12.928
Chardonnay?

35:12.953 --> 35:15.006
I tried to feed her rosé once.

35:15.281 --> 35:17.383
Pew! Punched me right in the knee.

35:17.844 --> 35:19.662
Mm. Alright.

35:19.687 --> 35:22.568
Well, I'm gonna go
say bye to those guys.

35:22.593 --> 35:23.639
Thank you.

35:23.663 --> 35:24.914
Of course.

35:29.446 --> 35:31.351
- Gary.
- Hmm?

35:32.031 --> 35:33.748
Why didn't you just tell her?

35:33.773 --> 35:35.109
It's a bottle of wine, Gina.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.694
She doesn't need to know it was from me.

35:36.718 --> 35:40.114
I don't mean the wine.
I mean about how you feel.

35:44.867 --> 35:45.953
Maggie's made it very clear

35:45.977 --> 35:48.576
that she only wants to be friends, okay?

35:48.601 --> 35:51.288
And maybe friends is all
we're supposed to be.

35:51.823 --> 35:54.296
I can't put myself out there again.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.855
Someone took your pen and wrote
the first part of your story,

38:16.879 --> 38:20.096
and a lot of that story wasn't fair.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.967
But you have that pen back now.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.915

38:39.104 --> 38:41.003
I'm talking about the helicopter.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.838
It just hovered over Los Angeles

38:42.862 --> 38:45.094
for two hours and seventeen minutes.

38:45.119 --> 38:47.691
Which is the only way
you want to experience L. A.

38:49.604 --> 38:51.806
Oh. It's Isaac.

39:09.315 --> 39:12.492
Look, I'm sorry
I was so distracted today.

39:12.517 --> 39:15.412
Those big studio movies
are hard to say no to.

39:15.436 --> 39:18.499
But they're also how I get
to make the good ones,

39:18.844 --> 39:20.389
like yours.

39:21.943 --> 39:25.108
I mean, you would need to
refuel or something, right?

39:25.133 --> 39:26.727
Depends on how big the tank is.

39:28.254 --> 39:30.093
I guess so.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.125
- Wow.
- So?

39:33.037 --> 39:34.390
What did he say?

39:34.414 --> 39:36.711
Uh, he said...

39:37.586 --> 39:38.639
he's in.

39:38.664 --> 39:40.351
Pow!

39:40.628 --> 39:43.524
Hey, here's to hoping your
movie's a huge success.

39:43.548 --> 39:44.938
- Yeah.
- I'll drink to that.

39:44.963 --> 39:46.203
Yes, sir.

39:47.260 --> 39:49.844
- Mm.
- Oh, and, uh...

39:50.555 --> 39:52.321
thanks for today, son.

39:54.009 --> 39:56.046
We still on for lunch next week?

39:56.071 --> 39:57.843
How about tomorrow?

39:57.868 --> 39:59.305
Can't.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.407
I have a meeting with Will Smith.

40:02.916 --> 40:04.907
I'll tell him you said hi.

40:06.205 --> 40:07.839
Your dad's quite the character.

40:07.864 --> 40:10.551
Oh, he is definitely the real deal.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.636
I think more of, like,
social work or something.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.969
- Yes. Abso...
- Oh, my God.

40:14.994 --> 40:17.329
- What's wrong?
- That's him.

40:17.354 --> 40:19.577
- That guy talking to Rome.
- That's Derek.

40:19.602 --> 40:20.930
Eve!

40:23.630 --> 40:25.107
Evie, hey.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.858
I was so worried about you,

40:26.883 --> 40:28.694
and when I couldn't reach you,
I called Elise,

40:28.718 --> 40:30.779
and she told me you moved to Boston.

40:30.803 --> 40:32.899
Oh, my God. Are you...?

40:34.586 --> 40:36.827
That's incredible, a baby.

40:37.047 --> 40:38.746
Oh!

40:39.008 --> 40:41.498
Oh, when you left,
I didn't know why, but I get it now.

40:41.522 --> 40:44.039
Oh, baby. This is amazing.

40:45.568 --> 40:48.897
Hey, look, is there, um,
somewhere we could talk?

40:48.922 --> 40:50.382
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah?

40:50.641 --> 40:51.678
Let me just grab my coat.

40:51.703 --> 40:53.086
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.888
Okay, just keep walking,
we'll go out through the office

40:55.912 --> 40:57.116
and I'll call the police, tell them..

40:57.140 --> 40:58.600
- Don't.
- ... a temporary restraining order

40:58.624 --> 41:00.294
- ... against him.
- No, Gina, don't do that.

41:00.318 --> 41:02.311
S-So, wait a minute.
We... We been sitting here

41:02.335 --> 41:04.410
this whole time talking,
and you know Eve?

41:04.435 --> 41:06.793
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know her. Yeah.

41:06.818 --> 41:08.609
If you call the police,
you'll make it worse.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.152
He knows that I'm pregnant.

41:10.176 --> 41:13.597
If you do that, he'll never
sign away his parental rights.

41:13.622 --> 41:15.558
You said that you was from Philly.

41:15.583 --> 41:17.222
- Yeah.
- Alright.

41:17.247 --> 41:19.244
He's in love with me.

41:19.443 --> 41:22.019
He'll try to convince me
that we can be a family.

41:22.044 --> 41:23.749
He'll use the baby as
a way to stay together.

41:23.773 --> 41:26.137
You... You think the Flyers
got a shot this season?

41:26.162 --> 41:27.231
- What?
- Do you think that,

41:27.255 --> 41:29.035
uh, the Flyers have
a shot this season or what?

41:29.059 --> 41:31.120
I don't... I don't know, man.
I don't really follow.

41:31.145 --> 41:32.823
- No?
- I'm gonna go with him

41:32.848 --> 41:34.908
and get him to sign the consent form.

41:34.933 --> 41:36.679
Eve, no. It is too dangerous.

41:36.703 --> 41:39.003
- Well, maybe you know...
- No, I... Hold on.

41:39.372 --> 41:42.377
I have to. For the baby.

41:42.402 --> 41:43.402
Hey.

41:43.605 --> 41:45.214
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah, you?

41:45.239 --> 41:47.152
- Yeah.
- Let me help you with that.

41:49.549 --> 41:51.830
- What's the plan?
- She's gonna go with him.

41:51.855 --> 41:54.125
- What?
- I'll see you later.
