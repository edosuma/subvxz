WEBVTT

00:09.843 --> 00:11.877
We are
going to be together.

00:11.879 --> 00:13.746
Go home, unpack
a few things,

00:13.748 --> 00:16.315
meet me
here tomorrow night.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.417
(knocking)

00:18.785 --> 00:20.919
Clearly there's nothing
I can say.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.489
Yes, there is...

00:23.491 --> 00:24.957
"I'm staying".

00:24.959 --> 00:25.991
Happy birthday.

00:25.993 --> 00:26.825
Happy birthday!

00:26.827 --> 00:29.661
(Buddy)
The last time you two
celebrated a birthday together,

00:29.663 --> 00:31.697
you were three years old.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.565
I think I'm gonna go
with my mom.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.633
That's awesome.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.302
Too bad Elizabeth is stuck
here with her family.

00:37.304 --> 00:40.005
What do you mean?
What do
you think I mean?

00:40.007 --> 00:40.839
Okay, my son's room?

00:40.841 --> 00:43.876
Your husband knows that you
and I are having an affair.

00:43.878 --> 00:46.078
Trust me, Liz, he knows.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.347
And now, so do we.

00:52.085 --> 00:52.918
I saw my mother.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.387
She's waiting for me to
run away with her.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.455
I don't
know what I want.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.557
I'm your dad
and I'll take care of you.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.093
Carter asked me to say
goodbye for her.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.561
Don't underestimate me,
David.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.097
You made that
mistake once before.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.066
You were amazing.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.801
Was I?
Yes.

01:29.722 --> 01:32.391
Lori should be
here in about ten minutes.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.129
Carter?

01:37.131 --> 01:38.730
Carter?

01:38.732 --> 01:39.198
Carter?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.299
Have you seen my
little girl?

01:40.301 --> 01:45.871
She's got a denim vest
and pink hi-top sneakers.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.106
Carter?

01:49.809 --> 01:52.611
Carter?

01:52.613 --> 01:53.712
Mommy?

01:53.714 --> 01:55.614
Oh, Carter.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.081
Oh.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.683
I was looking all over
for you.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.252
I went with
Happy to feed to ducks.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.687
I was so scared.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.122
Mommy thought she
lost you.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.823
You didn't,
I'm right here.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.025
I can never lose you,
ever, ever, ever.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.094
You're the only
thing that matters to me,

02:09.096 --> 02:11.163
the only thing in
the whole world.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.931
You won't lose me.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.100
Promise, pinky swear?

02:15.102 --> 02:16.768
Promise, pinky swear.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.670
Promise,
pinky swear.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.877
You okay?

02:24.879 --> 02:26.378
Oh-- Yeah.

02:26.380 --> 02:30.849
Just remembering
something.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.351
We're a
little early.

02:37.023 --> 02:40.225
Which direction do you think
she's coming from?

02:40.227 --> 02:42.728
No idea.

02:42.730 --> 02:46.198
When you talked to her
last night,

02:46.200 --> 02:48.300
how upset was
she when you told her

02:48.302 --> 02:51.136
I wasn't going
with her?

02:51.138 --> 02:55.340
I'm sure
you can imagine.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.875
Yeah.

02:59.045 --> 03:03.815
She's always said her
biggest fear was losing me.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.685
She must have known that
would be inevitable.

03:09.856 --> 03:13.258
Thank you
for arranging this meeting.

03:13.260 --> 03:16.695
This decision must have been
pretty hard.

03:16.697 --> 03:20.098
I didn't
want you to regret it.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.167
I don't.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.002
I really don't.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.271
Won't this be weird for
you, though?

03:26.273 --> 03:28.273
What, meeting Lori?

03:32.378 --> 03:34.680
Don't worry about me.

03:37.217 --> 03:44.156
♪

03:47.126 --> 03:49.695
What time is it?

03:49.697 --> 03:51.897
It's still 11:30.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.366
About 11:31.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.802
What should we do?

03:56.804 --> 03:59.304
I say we give it another
half-hour.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.006
That's what
you said half an hour ago.

04:01.008 --> 04:01.840
She's a fugitive.

04:01.842 --> 04:06.144
Maybe she thought she's been
spotted and it wasn't safe.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.646
I don't know,
if she wanted to see me,

04:07.648 --> 04:09.248
she would have
found a way.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.617
Is it possible...

04:11.619 --> 04:14.886
she'd rather not
see you than say goodbye?

04:20.026 --> 04:20.759
Yeah.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.194
If I were
in her position,

04:22.196 --> 04:24.263
I like to think I'd be
generous enough

04:24.265 --> 04:27.399
not to put you
through any more pain,

04:27.401 --> 04:29.968
just let you go live
your life.

04:32.872 --> 04:36.208
Yeah, that sounds
like her.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.310
You wanna go do that?

04:46.886 --> 04:48.920
Okay.

Grant, can I come in?

05:41.074 --> 05:44.276
Hey, aren't you hungry-- You
haven't eaten all day?

05:46.679 --> 05:48.213
Oh, that looks cool.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.948
Is that
a new game?

05:50.883 --> 05:52.617
Oh, I can't do that
anymore.

05:52.619 --> 05:53.752
You're getting too big.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.987
You should go away.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.156
Is there some reason you're
in a bad mood?

05:58.158 --> 06:00.992
Yes, because
you won't go away.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.227
Oh, okay.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.628
Why, what did I do?

06:03.630 --> 06:08.700
Grant, tell me what I did
and maybe I can fix it.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.370
Okay, this
is ridiculous, say something.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.106
I hate you.

06:14.108 --> 06:14.873
What?

06:14.875 --> 06:17.943
I hate you, now get
out of my room!

06:23.983 --> 06:25.851
Uh, whatever I did,
I'm-

06:25.853 --> 06:27.352
Just get out!

06:38.831 --> 06:40.399
Hey, what's going on?

06:40.401 --> 06:43.101
Grant just
told me that he hates me,

06:43.103 --> 06:47.038
out of nowhere, just started
screaming,

06:47.040 --> 06:49.274
"I hate you."

06:49.276 --> 06:50.642
Well, we knew this day
was coming.

06:50.644 --> 06:54.045
It didn't feel like adolescent
Freudian rebellion.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.047
It felt like hate.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.716
You want
me to go talk to him?

06:57.718 --> 06:59.351
I'd love
to know what I did.

06:59.353 --> 07:01.253
You gave birth to him.

07:05.291 --> 07:08.160
Grant?

07:08.162 --> 07:09.294
Bud?

07:15.134 --> 07:16.134
Relax.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.869
This is
all very normal.

07:27.980 --> 07:31.950
Hey, how
did the test go?

07:31.952 --> 07:33.151
Terrible.

07:33.653 --> 07:37.856
That's impossible, I saw how
much you studied.

07:37.858 --> 07:38.957
It's your fault.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.192
You took over
my brain.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.060
There's no space
anymore for stupid things

07:42.062 --> 07:45.831
like the Peloponnesian War
or the carbon cycle.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.899
No, hey, now, the carbon
cycle's not stupid.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.836
Understanding our impact on the
carbon cycle and climate change

07:50.838 --> 07:53.071
is the key to our continued
existence as a species

07:53.073 --> 07:58.610
on this planet,
so really, if anything&

07:58.612 --> 07:59.945
I think there should be
less of me

07:59.947 --> 08:01.012
and more
of the carbon cycle.

08:01.014 --> 08:05.150
When you talk like that,
the carbon cycle has no chance.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.022
(knocking)

08:11.024 --> 08:12.257
Shh, shh&

08:12.259 --> 08:15.794
I've been getting a lot
of Mormons.

08:19.832 --> 08:20.365
(knocking)

08:20.367 --> 08:22.334
(Grant)
Hey, Max, you home.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.702
Grant?

08:29.308 --> 08:30.775
Oh, great, it's you.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.010
I could say
the exact same thing

08:32.012 --> 08:33.945
in the exact same tone
of voice to you

08:33.947 --> 08:36.014
and I would
have way more reason.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.049
Oh, yeah--
Why is that?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.150
Never mind.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.653
Hey, dude-- Come in.

08:44.957 --> 08:45.991
Ugh.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.593
What are
you doing here?

08:48.595 --> 08:51.129
Mom's having
an affair.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.731
Whoa.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.298
Grant, I get it.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.966
I'm with Max, Carter's
with Crash,

08:54.968 --> 08:57.135
you feel left out
and you need attention-

08:57.137 --> 08:58.270
Taylor.

08:58.272 --> 09:03.642
Mom is having sex with
Gabe's dad.

09:03.644 --> 09:04.943
Oh, no.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.311
That's not true.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.013
It's just not.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.683
It's true.

09:13.119 --> 09:15.687
I can't believe it.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.022
I'll be
taking my apology now.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.892
I'd also like a box of
donuts and a nap.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.862
Carter is
not gonna like this.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.964
That is
such a disturbing image.

09:25.966 --> 09:30.702
Has this been going on since
before Carter got home?

09:30.704 --> 09:32.704
A little longer.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.873
How much longer?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.141
About three years.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.843
(Taylor and Carter)
Three years?

09:38.845 --> 09:41.079
Wait, you knew about this
for three years

09:41.081 --> 09:42.981
and you didn't
say anything to him?

09:42.983 --> 09:45.050
You didn't, like, ask
him to stop?

09:45.052 --> 09:47.252
No, I couldn't.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.020
You knew
my mom had cancer.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.355
Yeah, brain tumor,
right?

09:50.357 --> 09:55.093
And then in her
spine and in her blood.

09:55.095 --> 09:55.860
I'm sorry.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.062
The last six months
of her life,

09:57.064 --> 09:59.664
she spent on a hospital
bed in our living room.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.867
My dad didn't want
her to die in a hospital.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.870
Man, that sounds really
difficult.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.672
How old were you?

10:07.674 --> 10:08.974
Nine.

10:08.976 --> 10:09.874
Wow--

10:09.876 --> 10:11.776
Yeah, it
was pretty terrible.

10:11.778 --> 10:15.880
After she passed, my dad shut
down and he functioned,

10:15.882 --> 10:19.117
but he didn't really
seem to feel anything,

10:19.119 --> 10:24.122
At first, I was scared,
but after five years,

10:24.124 --> 10:25.390
I just figure it-

10:25.392 --> 10:27.859
It's who he is.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.160
And then one day he
comes home

10:29.162 --> 10:33.264
and he's laughing
and telling stories.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.433
It was like someone had
flipped the on switch,

10:35.435 --> 10:39.137
his new
partner, your mom.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.739
Three years
is a long time.

10:40.741 --> 10:45.377
You have to consider love
as a possibility,

10:45.379 --> 10:46.911
even if
you don't want to.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.047
I definitely don't
want to.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.148
My dad
loves your mom.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.150
He keeps a picture of her
on his bedside table

10:52.152 --> 10:55.620
and he wouldn't
do that unless he loved her.

10:55.622 --> 10:56.388
Well, then, yeah, okay,

10:56.390 --> 10:59.290
he's probably gonna get hurt
really bad,

10:59.292 --> 11:02.127
but this
ends now, it has to.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.629
Who's gonna tell
her, you?

11:04.631 --> 11:06.631
Yes, I will tell her.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.199
And Taylor.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.134
What?

11:09.136 --> 11:10.702
Did anyone
see my hand go up?

11:10.704 --> 11:12.904
You're gonna tell your mom
to break up with my dad.

11:12.906 --> 11:16.041
Gabe, no matter how happy
your dad is,

11:16.043 --> 11:18.209
this is
wrong and you know it.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.078
Carter, you can't
tell someone how to be.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.747
Look how well that works when
Elizabeth tries it with you.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.382
I can ask
her to stop lying,

11:24.384 --> 11:25.784
tell her
that her 12-year-old son

11:25.786 --> 11:27.018
can't even stand to look
at her anymore,

11:27.020 --> 11:30.221
I can tell her that
I think she's better than that.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.691
Okay.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.225
Okay.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.128
Will you watch Grant?

11:37.130 --> 11:37.962
Yeah.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.665
Yeah, he's my little
brother, too.

11:43.269 --> 11:44.402
Ready?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.842
Ready.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.245
That was another category
of bad idea.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.281
I thought you
were great, considering.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.115
Considering what?

11:57.117 --> 11:59.317
Considering you're
a terrible runner.

12:03.923 --> 12:07.225
What is it, what's wrong?
Elizabeth.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.127
We need to talk.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.267
I'm really nervous.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.236
Can I ask what's
going on?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.205
Nope.
Sorry.

12:35.921 --> 12:36.888
Go.

12:36.890 --> 12:40.091
We know you've been sleeping
with Gabe's dad.

12:40.093 --> 12:40.692
What?

12:40.694 --> 12:42.761
Why would you say this--
Where is this coming from?

12:42.763 --> 12:46.464
We had a conversation with
Kyle in Grant's room.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.867
While Grant
was in the closet.

12:50.770 --> 12:55.140
Oh, my God.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.308
Oh, my God, he
heard us.

13:00.412 --> 13:03.181
That's why he
said that he hated me.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.183
Do you
really blame him?

13:05.185 --> 13:08.486
No, he has every right to hate
me, you should hate me.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.388
Everyone in
this house should hate me.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.023
So you will end it
with Kyle?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.158
It's over,
it has been over.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.760
No, he keeps a picture of
you by his bedside.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.695
Who told you that?
Gabe.

13:17.697 --> 13:18.196
What?

13:18.198 --> 13:21.132
He's known
for three years.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.300
He has?

13:22.302 --> 13:26.738
Yes.

13:26.740 --> 13:29.073
Okay.

13:29.075 --> 13:33.678
Well.

13:33.680 --> 13:38.082
I'm incredibly embarrassed.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.083
And ashamed.

13:39.085 --> 13:44.823
And I'm very, very sorry.

13:44.825 --> 13:49.227
Yes, I will end it with Kyle
once and for all.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.728
And you
have to tell Dad.

13:50.730 --> 13:55.099
Carter, I just
got my family back

13:55.101 --> 13:57.035
and I don't want to
destroy that.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.437
What, are you just gonna
keep on lying to him?

14:05.077 --> 14:07.178
I'll tell him.

14:07.180 --> 14:07.879
Okay.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.747
Do it tonight and then
it will all be over

14:09.749 --> 14:12.417
and we can
all go back to normal.

14:12.419 --> 14:19.824
Let's go.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.826
I just...

14:24.763 --> 14:25.797
Carter did
most of the talking

14:25.799 --> 14:29.400
and she's really good
at that, but...

14:29.402 --> 14:32.804
I just wanted to
say that I'm really hurt

14:32.806 --> 14:34.038
because my whole life,

14:34.040 --> 14:37.375
I've been trying
to make you proud of me.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.310
Every single thing
I did,

14:39.312 --> 14:42.313
I would stop and ask
myself if you would approve,

14:42.315 --> 14:44.749
every single thing.

14:44.751 --> 14:45.283
And then you-

14:45.285 --> 14:49.053
You go and you sleep with my
best friend's dad

14:49.055 --> 14:52.423
and you don't even think of
how I'm gonna feel about that.

14:52.425 --> 14:55.460
I obviously didn't cross
your mind at all.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.961
No, Taylor-

15:01.133 --> 15:04.402
♪ The stars all disappear

15:04.404 --> 15:07.105
She was crying
and she got really scared.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.073
I just told her something
that could potentially

15:09.075 --> 15:11.276
lose her her family.

15:11.278 --> 15:16.047
You're not responsible
if that happens.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.651
She is.

15:19.653 --> 15:23.821
God, I am so not used to
this family drama.

15:26.392 --> 15:31.162
Can't we all just
be happy at the same time.

15:31.164 --> 15:31.996
I wouldn't know.

15:31.998 --> 15:34.732
The only person
in my family is me.

15:34.734 --> 15:38.236
God, I'm sorry, you must
be hating this conversation.

15:38.238 --> 15:41.072
That's not true.

15:41.074 --> 15:44.876
I've never been happier
in my whole life.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.781
Are you making me
wait?

15:49.783 --> 15:51.349
Yeah.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.318
I don't like to wait.

16:04.863 --> 16:06.397
Is this a good time?
For what?

16:06.399 --> 16:08.733
For you to tell me what's
going on?

16:08.735 --> 16:09.767
David, I just need-

16:09.769 --> 16:10.935
Another
45-minute shower

16:10.937 --> 16:12.937
or 20 more minutes of
aimless staring?

16:12.939 --> 16:14.205
you've got
me pretty on edge.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.208
I've been having
an affair.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.878
I know.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.680
You know?

16:22.682 --> 16:25.049
With Kyle,
yes, I know.

16:27.753 --> 16:28.853
Why didn't you say
something?

16:28.855 --> 16:30.855
Like what-- Can
you please stop banging

16:30.857 --> 16:33.057
your extremely handsome partner?

16:33.059 --> 16:36.394
Did I have
to tell you that?

16:36.396 --> 16:39.931
Why did you stay
with me?

16:39.933 --> 16:43.167
I knew
one day you'd stop.

16:47.773 --> 16:51.209
I knew he didn't mean
that much to you.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.677
How?

16:52.679 --> 16:55.313
Because I know you.

16:55.315 --> 16:59.450
I know how you
are when you're in love.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.419
Yes, you do.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.422
I'm so sorry, David.

17:07.393 --> 17:08.159
Was it over?

17:08.161 --> 17:15.199
It's over--
Done, dead.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.402
I miss you.

17:29.348 --> 17:32.917
Is this what the girls wanted
to talk to you about?

17:32.919 --> 17:34.986
Yes.
This affair?

17:34.988 --> 17:36.020
Yes.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.155
Who told them?

17:37.157 --> 17:39.357
Grant overheard Kyle
and I-

17:39.359 --> 17:40.958
No, no&

17:40.960 --> 17:41.392
David.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.929
Now I look like a loser to my
children, to Carter.

17:44.931 --> 17:47.732
She is so excited
to finally have a dad.

17:47.734 --> 17:52.203
She trusts me, she respects
me, she...

17:52.205 --> 17:54.739
Now she pities me.
Because she cares.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.240
No, you don't-
Don't tell-

17:56.242 --> 17:58.409
You're not
the object of pity, I am.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.077
To who?

17:59.079 --> 18:01.312
To you,
my unfaithful wife,

18:01.314 --> 18:04.715
to you every time I write
a book that doesn't sell.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.885
I have always been supportive
and sympathetic.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.187
Your pity is
so much a part of you,

18:09.189 --> 18:10.421
you don't even know
you have it.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.924
I have to do
something, I have to.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.892
All right.

18:14.894 --> 18:15.993
Okay.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.795
Look at me.

18:20.966 --> 18:23.267
I will do anything.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.237
Will you?
Anything.

18:33.745 --> 18:35.346
Hello?

18:35.348 --> 18:37.115
(David)
Hey.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.283
Hi, guys.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.718
Hi.

18:43.989 --> 18:45.690
How is everything?

18:45.692 --> 18:46.324
Things are good.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.326
Look, we don't have to tip toe
around the subject.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.996
Your mom and I had a very
open and honest conversation.

18:51.998 --> 18:55.666
We worked things out.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.734
Is anyone hungry?

18:56.736 --> 18:59.170
Yes--
I can make something.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.004
Grilled cheese?

19:00.006 --> 19:01.239
Yeah, grilled cheese for
everyone.

19:01.241 --> 19:04.408
I would love one of your
grilled cheese sandwiches.
Yeah--

19:04.410 --> 19:07.211
Where's mom?

19:07.213 --> 19:10.915
She moved out.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.718
What?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.887
But you just said you worked
everything out.

19:15.889 --> 19:19.357
We did,
and she's gone.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.269
Hey.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.069
Hello.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.838
Mom leave
you a letter, too?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.773
Yeah.
What's yours say?

19:35.775 --> 19:38.042
Just that she knows
I'm gonna be blaming myself

19:38.044 --> 19:41.312
for what happened, that
I shouldn't.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.346
Great day, huh?

19:42.348 --> 19:47.752
I went from having
two mothers to no mothers.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.954
What does yours say?

19:52.324 --> 19:54.392
Is that
your first tooth?

19:54.394 --> 19:55.026
Yeah.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.930
I didn't think she saved
that kind of stuff, but...

19:58.932 --> 20:00.364
I guess she does.

20:03.468 --> 20:07.071
What are we
gonna do?

"Pussycat, pussycat, where
have you been?

24:20.259 --> 24:23.494
I've been to
London to visit the queen."

24:23.496 --> 24:28.199
Oh, I'm finding this poem
rather beautiful.

24:28.201 --> 24:29.433
Do go on.

24:29.435 --> 24:30.267
Pussycat!

24:30.269 --> 24:32.269
(laughing, giggling)

24:32.271 --> 24:36.740
That's a really good
British accent.

24:36.742 --> 24:38.075
Oh.

24:42.080 --> 24:42.746
Come here.

24:42.748 --> 24:44.482
Come here, let's get you
off the floor.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.350
Come on, here.

24:46.352 --> 24:48.419
Oh...

24:48.421 --> 24:51.021
Oh, you're beautiful.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.857
Okay.

24:52.859 --> 24:53.924
You're my boyfriend.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.793
Are you
my boyfriend?

24:55.795 --> 24:57.761
Yes, I am your
boyfriend.

24:57.763 --> 24:58.929
Here, sit down.

24:58.931 --> 25:02.366
I have a beautiful
boyfriend.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.735
Shh!

25:04.737 --> 25:07.404
Shh&

25:12.944 --> 25:15.980
Aren't you gonna lay
with me?

25:15.982 --> 25:18.115
No.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.850
I want you to.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.819
I know.

25:21.821 --> 25:24.288
Not while you're
high.

25:27.459 --> 25:30.961
Poo.

25:30.963 --> 25:34.031
But I do
wanna be with you.

25:34.033 --> 25:38.235
Just not like this.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.337
Go to sleep.

25:49.681 --> 25:56.820
You have me wrapped around
your little finger.

25:56.822 --> 25:59.356
Promise, pinky swear?

25:59.358 --> 26:01.091
What the hell
is that?

26:01.093 --> 26:02.793
(chuckling)

26:02.795 --> 26:03.360
Nothing.

26:03.362 --> 26:10.301
Something my mom and I used to
say to each other.

26:10.303 --> 26:13.404
I miss her.

26:13.406 --> 26:17.107
You'll see her again,
Carter.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.310
I'll find
her for you.

26:25.383 --> 26:27.918
Really?

26:27.920 --> 26:30.321
Yeah.

26:30.323 --> 26:38.062
♪

26:39.030 --> 26:41.265
(phone vibrating)

26:52.310 --> 26:55.212
Hey, Mom, can you come
pick me up?

27:02.253 --> 27:04.388
You left Grant alone?

27:04.390 --> 27:05.489
He's 12 years old.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.091
Do you know how
irresponsible that is...

27:07.093 --> 27:11.028
We know.
... and potentially
extremely dangerous?

27:11.030 --> 27:13.297
Yes.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.031
God.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.766
I'm really
sorry for everything,

27:15.768 --> 27:17.434
but I haven't even been
out of this house

27:17.436 --> 27:21.739
a full 24 hours
and you're already stoned.

27:21.741 --> 27:25.209
We are
falling apart here.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.711
Please come home.

27:27.713 --> 27:30.214
Well, your father doesn't
want that.

27:37.789 --> 27:38.822
(sighing)

27:38.824 --> 27:41.325
Well, I do--
I'm gonna tell him.

27:46.064 --> 27:48.098
Taylor.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.800
All right,
I am going to take you

27:49.802 --> 27:53.470
up to your room
young lady.

27:53.472 --> 27:54.371
Okay.

27:54.373 --> 27:57.408
My little flower child.

28:02.313 --> 28:04.248
Dad?

28:08.019 --> 28:09.820
Dad?

28:29.507 --> 28:32.409
Hey.
Hey.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.377
What'd he say?

28:33.379 --> 28:35.012
He wasn't in there.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.346
But this was.

28:36.348 --> 28:40.217
Oh, he's in
his Ernest Hemingway mode.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.352
I know exactly where
he is.

28:51.262 --> 28:53.197
We need to talk.

28:53.199 --> 28:57.301
Carter,
I've decided.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.870
I'm getting divorced.

29:04.542 --> 29:06.176
You, of anyone,
should understand

29:06.178 --> 29:09.179
what it's like to have to
reinvent yourself.

29:09.181 --> 29:12.950
That's what
I have to do.

29:12.952 --> 29:13.617
Your mother-
Sorry.

29:13.619 --> 29:16.587
Elizabeth married
a very promising young writer

29:16.589 --> 29:22.659
who was going to introduce her
to the literary life.

29:22.661 --> 29:24.661
I'm not
that person, am I?

29:24.663 --> 29:28.098
Don't answer that.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.034
And I will probably never
be that person.

29:31.036 --> 29:36.507
Why does any of this mean you
have to get a divorce?

29:36.509 --> 29:41.178
Because I let
her down.

29:41.180 --> 29:45.516
The only book
anyone wants from me

29:45.518 --> 29:49.386
is the one I can't
write.

29:49.388 --> 29:55.692
"Finding Carter."

29:55.694 --> 29:58.162
But it's okay...

29:58.164 --> 30:01.365
because I found
Carter.

30:07.939 --> 30:10.073
He wants a divorce.

30:10.075 --> 30:11.575
He does?

30:11.577 --> 30:15.345
I thought
this was fixable.

30:15.347 --> 30:18.448
I really did.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.083
It is fixable.

30:20.085 --> 30:21.451
You're just-

30:21.453 --> 30:23.554
You're not the one that
can fix it.

30:23.556 --> 30:28.091
Look, I have to make
100% sure that if you could,

30:28.093 --> 30:30.727
he would come home and that
you would be willing

30:30.729 --> 30:32.963
to work on
things with Dad.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.399
Ye-- Yes.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.051
(Carter)
I've given
this a lot of thought

30:54.053 --> 30:56.620
and I want to help
fix things.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.256
I don't understand.

30:59.258 --> 31:00.924
If you don't
divorce Elizabeth,

31:00.926 --> 31:03.627
you let her come home and you're
willing to work on things,

31:03.629 --> 31:06.997
then I will let you write
your book "Finding Carter."

31:10.969 --> 31:14.338
I don't know what
to say.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.439
Are you sure?

31:15.441 --> 31:18.208
I mean, we'll need to discuss
what goes in the book

31:18.210 --> 31:21.278
and then I'll
want to approve everything.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.213
One hundred percent,
yeah.

31:23.215 --> 31:23.947
Absolutely.

31:23.949 --> 31:26.583
And if I say you can't write
something, you just-

31:26.585 --> 31:28.118
you can't put it in.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.220
Of course.

31:32.490 --> 31:35.592
Thank you.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.094
So that's a yes?

31:37.096 --> 31:39.730
Elizabeth can come home?

31:39.732 --> 31:40.530
I'm overwhelmed.

31:40.532 --> 31:44.735
We really mean that
much to you?

31:44.737 --> 31:46.570
Yes.

31:54.712 --> 31:58.348
I still don't know why you
won't tell me how you did it.

31:58.350 --> 32:01.685
Because that's
not what's important.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.420
Thanks.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.089
I don't know why you would
do this for me.

32:18.069 --> 32:19.636
(clearing throat)

32:19.638 --> 32:20.504
"Carter...

32:20.506 --> 32:22.973
"the achievement I
am most proud of in my life

32:22.975 --> 32:24.608
"is that you don't hate
me anymore.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.276
"I am sure you
will blame yourself

32:26.278 --> 32:27.611
"for your dad and me
separating,

32:27.613 --> 32:30.013
"but I want to
thank you for making me

32:30.015 --> 32:31.548
"be honest with him.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.650
"It was the first entirely
honest conversation

32:33.652 --> 32:38.055
"I think I've
had with anyone in years.

32:38.057 --> 32:41.258
"I owe all my honesty
to you.

32:41.260 --> 32:44.261
Elizabeth."

32:44.263 --> 32:47.164
I'm pretty proud of
that letter.

32:49.167 --> 32:51.134
All right, I'll
see you later at home.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.536
Wait, you're not coming
home now?

32:52.538 --> 32:53.537
Mm-mm, I'm going
to work.

32:53.539 --> 32:56.640
What happened to doing it all
differently this time?

32:56.642 --> 32:59.343
Trust me--
Come on.

33:09.754 --> 33:11.321
Hey!

33:11.323 --> 33:12.489
Mom!

33:12.491 --> 33:14.291
Hey!

33:15.093 --> 33:16.693
Oh, I'm
so glad you're back.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.061
Come here.

33:19.030 --> 33:21.365
Please tell me you
got milk.

33:21.367 --> 33:22.966
Mm-hmm.

33:22.968 --> 33:23.967
See, see?

33:23.969 --> 33:25.268
This is
how it's done.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.070
Tell him your news.

33:27.072 --> 33:28.271
Okay.

33:28.273 --> 33:32.175
I took a leave of absence
from my job today.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.011
You did?

33:34.013 --> 33:35.412
You did.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.314
(David)
Why?

33:38.549 --> 33:39.750
Hey.

33:39.752 --> 33:42.219
Well, I said from the beginning
that I became a cop

33:42.221 --> 33:45.255
so I could
find my daughter and...

33:45.257 --> 33:48.291
I found my daughter.

33:48.293 --> 33:49.693
You know
what this means?

33:49.695 --> 33:51.561
We no longer have
a cop in our family.

33:51.563 --> 33:54.264
Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's just
a leave of absence.

33:54.266 --> 33:58.535
We temporarily no longer
have a cop in our family.

34:03.674 --> 34:05.475
Thanks for
letting me come home.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.744
Yeah, we just got our family
back together again,

34:07.746 --> 34:11.548
it seemed like a really
bad idea to tear it apart.

34:11.550 --> 34:15.185
Yeah,
really bad idea.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.753
I want it to work.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.455
Yeah.

34:18.457 --> 34:19.990
We all do.

34:19.992 --> 34:22.325
Well, I'm starving--
Can we eat?

34:22.327 --> 34:24.494
Yeah, we should eat, just
drop that stuff.

34:24.496 --> 34:28.465
Come on--
Let's go.

34:28.467 --> 34:36.239
Something healthy.

34:36.241 --> 34:40.310
(Elizabeth)
Carter.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.178
Hey.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.113
Come here.

34:43.115 --> 34:45.282
Look at this.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.517
Okay, this is
Taylor's.

34:47.519 --> 34:51.221
And look
what I did.

34:55.126 --> 34:59.029
Is that me?
Yeah.

34:59.031 --> 35:00.464
Doesn't Grant get
a book?

35:00.466 --> 35:02.432
I owe
Grant so much,

35:02.434 --> 35:04.201
but I am going to be
the best,

35:04.203 --> 35:08.638
or somewhat passable
stay-at-home mom ever.

35:10.741 --> 35:12.709
You loved your baths.

35:15.246 --> 35:16.113
Yeah, I don't-

35:16.115 --> 35:21.485
I don't know if this is all
right for me to say, but...

35:21.487 --> 35:27.290
I know
that you saw Lori.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.058
You heard?

35:28.060 --> 35:34.297
And I just want to say,
thank you for staying.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.032
For choosing us.

35:40.037 --> 35:44.040
I almost talked
to her.

35:44.042 --> 35:45.575
I thought he made
the call.

35:45.577 --> 35:47.377
No, actually, I called,

35:47.379 --> 35:49.012
but then the second I heard
her voice,

35:49.014 --> 35:50.247
I just froze,
I couldn't speak,

35:50.249 --> 35:53.183
so I had to give the phone
to David.

35:53.185 --> 35:53.984
You were with him?

35:53.986 --> 35:55.418
You heard
the whole conversation?

35:55.420 --> 35:57.320
It wasn't
really a conversation.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.222
It was just David saying
that you were staying

35:59.224 --> 36:04.995
and that she should
go and leave us alone.

36:04.997 --> 36:07.430
That was it--
Nothing about a meeting?

36:07.432 --> 36:08.198
A meeting?

36:08.200 --> 36:10.033
With Lori, why would they
have a meeting.

36:10.035 --> 36:11.535
So I could
say goodbye?

36:11.537 --> 36:13.303
No, no meeting.

36:13.305 --> 36:15.405
Nothing about me meeting
her, nothing.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.240
You keep asking
me about this meeting,

36:17.242 --> 36:19.543
I don't know what you're
talking about.

36:19.545 --> 36:22.546
Oh, my God.

36:22.548 --> 36:23.613
What's wrong?

36:23.615 --> 36:26.416
Oh, my God.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.318
It never ends.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.986
What never ends?

36:29.988 --> 36:31.288
The lies.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.490
Everything he told me
was a-

36:33.492 --> 36:34.991
Oh, my God.

36:34.993 --> 36:40.497
♪ Hey now don't you run away
Don't you run away ♪

36:40.499 --> 36:41.431
♪ You're safe

36:41.433 --> 36:47.037
♪ Hey now don't you be afraid
don't you be afraid ♪

36:47.039 --> 36:47.971

36:55.314 --> 36:57.781
♪ Safe

36:57.783 --> 37:00.383
I had to protect my family,
so I got rid of Lori.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.153
(Elizabeth)
You're letting him write
"Finding Carter."

37:04.388 --> 37:06.823
Are you sure you want
to do this?

37:06.825 --> 37:07.457
Yes.

37:07.459 --> 37:08.491
I want it
to be perfect.

37:08.493 --> 37:10.293
Yes, I need my bank to
cover some debts.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.195
What am I supposed to
do with it?
Pay off your debt.

37:12.197 --> 37:13.630
Where's Carter?

37:13.632 --> 37:15.198
Still in jail.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.333
Jail?
