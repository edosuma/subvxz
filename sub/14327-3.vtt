20:47.871 --> 20:49.581
AND SO AM I!

20:49.665 --> 20:52.334
{\an1}I WISH EVERYBODY
WAS BACK TO NORMAL

20:52.417 --> 20:55.545
{\an1}AND WE WERE ALL BACK IN
THE CRIMSON CHIN'S COMIC BOOK!

21:03.887 --> 21:04.513
OH, POOPIE.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.193
ADAM WEST'S WAISTBAND!

21:18.276 --> 21:20.112
I'M CHIN-TASTIC AGAIN!

21:20.195 --> 21:22.990
I DON'T UNDERSTAND!
YOU BEAT ME--

21:23.073 --> 21:25.867
A BUNCH OF NORMAL,
POWERLESS KIDS!

21:25.951 --> 21:26.952
DUDE! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

21:27.035 --> 21:29.538
{\an1}BEING NORMAL DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE POWERLESS.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.707
{\an1}IN FACT, NORMAL PEOPLE
CONTROL YOUR ENTIRE EXISTENCE!

21:31.790 --> 21:33.041
LIES!

21:33.125 --> 21:36.169
ACTUALLY...
IT'S TRUE!

21:36.253 --> 21:37.546
SEE THAT? THAT'S THE GUY

21:37.629 --> 21:38.714
{\an1}WHO WRITES THE STORIES
FOR YOUR COMIC BOOK!

21:38.797 --> 21:41.258
{\an1}AND HE BELIEVES THAT GOOD
SHOULD ALWAYS TRIUMPH OVER EVIL,

21:41.341 --> 21:44.219
AND WHAT THE WRITER SAYS, GOES!

21:44.302 --> 21:45.429
EGAD! NO WONDER
I CAN NEVER WIN!

21:45.512 --> 21:50.058
{\an1}RIGHT! SO YOU'LL ABANDON
YOUR MAD ATTEMPTS

21:50.142 --> 21:52.060
{\an1}TO TAKE OVER
THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORLD?

21:52.144 --> 21:53.311
OF COURSE NOT!
THE NEXT TIME I GET OUT,

21:53.395 --> 21:55.230
I'M NOT GOING AFTER
YOUR STUPID DOGS--

21:55.313 --> 21:59.317
{\an1}I'M GOING AFTER
A MUCH BIGGER PRIZE!

22:01.236 --> 22:04.740
{\an1}ACE! CLEFTO!
STOP HIM!

22:04.823 --> 22:06.366
LET HIM GO, CLEFT.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.202
HIS CHIN-THEMED BRAND OF EVIL
CAN NEVER TRIUMPH,

22:09.286 --> 22:11.163
{\an1}FOR WHEREVER THERE IS
A SINGLE BLADE OF GRASS

22:11.246 --> 22:12.914
{\an1}IN THE LAWN OF ALL
THAT IS GOOD...

22:12.998 --> 22:14.916
NO, UH...WAIT!

22:15.000 --> 22:18.128
{\an1}AS LONG AS THERE IS
A SINGLE SLICE OF JUSTICE

22:18.211 --> 22:19.671
ON THE DELI TRAY
THAT IS GOODNESS,

22:19.755 --> 22:22.883
{\an1}OUR SANDWICH OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
WILL ALWAYS BE A LOW-FAT

22:22.966 --> 22:24.885
AND DELICIOUS VICTORY!

22:24.968 --> 22:26.219
NO, WHAT I MEAN IS...

22:26.303 --> 22:29.556
{\an1}WAIT, IT'S NOT ME!
IT'S THE WRITER'S FAULT!

22:31.683 --> 22:36.396
AS LONG AS THERE IS
A SINGLE...ZIT...

22:36.480 --> 22:42.319
ON THE TEENAGE FACE
OF JUSTICE...

22:42.402 --> 22:44.404
NO, THAT'S--THAT'S DUMB.

22:44.488 --> 22:48.116
THE CRIMSON CHIN
WOULD NEVER SAY THAT...

22:48.200 --> 22:50.077
UNLESS I TELL HIM TO!
HEH HEH HEH HEH!

22:50.160 --> 22:52.579
[BANG BANG BANG]

22:52.662 --> 22:53.413
WHO IS IT?

22:53.497 --> 22:54.247
SPECIAL DELIVERY FOR THE GEEK

22:54.331 --> 22:58.126
WHO WRITES "THE CRIMSON CHIN"!

22:58.210 --> 22:59.336
OH, I HOPE
IT'S MY NEW ISSUE OF

22:59.419 --> 23:02.380
"NERDS WHO LIVE WITH
THEIR MOTHERS" MONTHLY!

23:06.635 --> 23:09.554
{\an1}LET'S HAVE A LITTLE CHAT
ABOUT HEROES!

23:10.097 --> 23:12.265
[STAMMERING]

23:12.349 --> 23:15.519
MOM! I'M GOING OUT!

23:15.602 --> 23:16.728
AAH!

23:16.812 --> 23:18.480
{\an1}[PUNCHING]

23:18.563 --> 23:22.692
