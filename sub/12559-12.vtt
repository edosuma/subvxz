I HAVE INSOMNIA

07:19.773 --> 07:22.435
AND WORKING ON THE
CLOCK RELAXES ME,

07:22.525 --> 07:26.109

08:04.401 --> 08:07.484
MY FATHER WAS VERY MUCH
IN LOVE WITH MY MOTHER.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.527
AND IN THOSE DAYS,

08:09.614 --> 08:11.196
IT WAS VERY FASHIONABLE

FOR HUSBANDS
AND WIVES

08:12.784 --> 08:15.242
TO BE IN LOVE

HE'S TRYING TO MAKE

12:33.836 --> 12:35.747
SOME COMPROMISE
WITH US, DOUG.

12:35.838 --> 12:40.253
<i>(Grandpa)
WELL, CHILDREN.</i>

12:40.343 --> 12:42.254
HELLO, GRANDPA.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.635
ITHOUGHT
WE'D GIVE IT A TRY THERE.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.178
TO SEE HOW IT LOOKS.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.506
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:47.600 --> 12:50.718
WELL--| DON'T KNOW.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.849
SAM, TAKE A LOOK
FOR YOURSELF.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.273
<i>IT STICKS OUT
LIKE A SORE THUMB.</i>

12:56.359 --> 13:00.853
YEAH, I GUESS IT DOES.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.063
SAM, WE MIGHT
AS WELL BE HONEST.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.489
THE DOCTOR SAYS
THE CLOCK SHOULD GO.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.283
THE DOCTOR SAID THAT?

13:07.370 --> 13:10.954
HE SAYS YOU'RE BEING
OBSESSED BY THE CLOCK.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.701
<i>HE SAYS
IT'S BAD FOR YOU.</i>

13:12.792 --> 13:14.954
SENILE-- THAT'S WHAT
HE REALLY SAID, ISN'T IT?

13:15.044 --> 13:16.500
NO, GRANDPA.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.498
YES, AND HE WANTS YOU
TO PUT ME AWAY.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.500
NO, GRANDPA,
HE DIDN'T SAY THAT.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.969
WELL, I'M NOT GOING
TO ANY LOONY BIN.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.469
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
I AM GOING TO DO.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.296
I'M GOING
TO SELL THE CLOCK.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.352
I LOVE THIS CLOCK

13:34.439 --> 13:35.770
AND YOUR NURSERY
IS BEAUTIFUL.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.313
MARNIE, IT'S
JUST PERFECT.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.644
OH, THANK YOU.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.396
WANT SOME
MORE COFFEE?

13:40.486 --> 13:41.692
I'D LOVE IT.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.235
I REFUSE
TO GET PREGNANT

13:43.323 --> 13:45.314
UNTIL I HAVE MY
NURSERY ALL PLANNED.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.194
GEORGE DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS LOGICAL.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.992
I HAVE TO AGREE
WITH HIM, CAROL.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.074
MR. FORSTMANN, VVHERE
VVILL YOU BE LIVING

13:51.164 --> 13:54.156
AFTER THE
BABY COMES?

13:54.208 --> 13:56.074
CAROL, HE'LL BE
STAYING RIGHT HERE

13:56.169 --> 13:57.830
IN HIS OWN ROOM.

13:57.879 --> 14:01.668
OH, WELL, OF COURSE,
I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.004
I'LL BE
NEEDING HIS HELP.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.923
YOU GONNA KEEP
THE CLOCK HERE?

14:11.017 --> 14:13.679
JUST TEMPORARILY.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.514
CAROL, DO YOU
KNOW ANYONE

14:15.563 --> 14:17.520
WHO MIGHT
LIKE TO BUY IT?

14:17.565 --> 14:19.522
SURE, ME.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.853
I WISH I COULD
AFFORD IT.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.017
DO YOU MEAN THAT?

14:22.111 --> 14:23.567
<i>DO I?</i>

14:23.654 --> 14:25.361
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
ABOUT ANTIQUES

14:25.448 --> 14:27.689
AND THAT CLOCK WILL
JUST MAKE OUR HALLWAY.

14:27.784 --> 14:31.652
OH, VVELL, I THINK THAT VVE
CAN VVORK OUT SOMETHING.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.329
I MEAN, YOU COULD PAY ME LATER.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.792
<i>IT DOESN'T MATTER.</i>

14:35.875 --> 14:37.707
ARE YOU SERIOUS,
MR. FORSTMANN?

14:37.752 --> 14:39.493
<i>YES. WHY, IT
WOULD BE PERFECT.</i>

14:39.587 --> 14:41.043
YOU LIVING
NEXT DOOR TO US,

14:41.130 --> 14:42.916
I COULD VISIT
THE CLOCK EVERY DAY.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.123
I MEAN, I COULD
TAKE CARE OF IT.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.879
KEEP IT
IN GOOD CONDITION.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.801
AND WE'D APPRECIATE IT.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.879
IT'S NOT ONE
OF YOUR EIGHT-DAY CLOCKS.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.555
IT'S SPECIAL.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.932
YOU HAVE TO WIND IT
EVERY OTHER DAY.

14:55.019 --> 14:58.228
<i>GRANDPA, I DON'T THINK CAROL WOULD
LIKE YOU TINKERING WITH IT.</i>

14:58.314 --> 15:00.100
IT'LL BE HER CLOCK.

15:00.191 --> 15:03.479
BUT IT'LL ONLY TAKE A FEVV
MINUTES EVERY OTHER DAY.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.606
OH, I WOULDN'T
MIND, MARNIE,

15:05.696 --> 15:07.824
<i>YOUR GRANDFATHER COULD
TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE OF IT.</i>

15:07.907 --> 15:10.239
<i>I'D APPRECIATE
IT, REALLY.</i>

15:10.326 --> 15:12.158
IT'S UP TO YOU
TWO, ANYWAY.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.236
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.495
GEORGE DOESN'T THINK
I'M A BARGAIN HUNTER.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.084
WAIT TILL HE
HEARS ABOUT THIS.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.467
GOOD MORNING, MARNIE.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.018
GOOD MORNING, GRANDPA.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.312
YOU'RE UP EARLY
THIS MORNING.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.481
WELL, EARLY TO BED,
EARLY TO RISE--

15:43.568 --> 15:45.150
YOU KNOW,
BEN FRANKLIN?

15:45.236 --> 15:47.102
OR WAS IT
GEORGE WASHINGTON?

15:47.155 --> 15:48.771
I'M OFF
TO WIND THE CLOCK.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.947
GEORGE AND CAROL
ARE OUT OF TOWN.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.073
<i>DIDN'T YOU
KNOW THAT?</i>

15:52.160 --> 15:53.446
OUT OF TOWN?

15:53.536 --> 15:55.118
JUST FOR
THE WEEKEND.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.195
YOU'LL HARDLY MISS A
VISIT TO YOUR CLOCK.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.783
DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT THE CLOCK
VVINDS DOVVN AFTER 48 HOURS?

16:00.877 --> 16:02.959
GRANDPA, ARE YOU GONNA
START THAT AGAIN?

16:03.004 --> 16:05.211
WE'VE BEEN SO HAPPY
FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.538
ALL OF US.

16:06.632 --> 16:10.466
YES, YES,
WE'VE BEEN HAPPY.

16:10.511 --> 16:14.470
TWO WEEKS OF
BORROWED TIME.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.631
I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.880
IT'S RUNNING OUT.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.636
IT'S DYING.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.579
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

18:02.373 --> 18:05.081
LOOK, OFFICER, I HA\/E TC
VVIND THE CLOCK, YOU KNCVV,

18:05.167 --> 18:06.749
IT'S RUNNING DOWN.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.668
IT MUST BE WOUND,
IT MUST BE.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.415
OH, SURE,
SURE, MISTER.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.497
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

18:12.592 --> 18:15.584
NEXT DOOR. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND--
I HA\/E TO VVIND THE CLOCK.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.047
COME ON, COME ON.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.970
YOU'LL WAKE THE
WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.138
LOOK, PLEASE, JUST LET ME
WIND THE CLOCK,

18:21.225 --> 18:22.807
AND THEN I'LL GO HOME.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.600
THAT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY.
I CAN'T LET YOU.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.477
YOU HAVE TO!

18:26.564 --> 18:27.850
NOW, LOOK, MISTER,

18:27.940 --> 18:29.442
I CAN'T LET YOU
GO IN THERE.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.860
BUT, DON'T YOU SEE?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.274
DON'T YOU SEE,
I'M RUNNING DOWN.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.357
AND IF THAT STOPS,
I'LL DIE.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.812
I'LL REALLY DIE.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.317
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.274
YOU MUSTN'T DO THIS,
YOU MUSTN'T.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.739
JUST LET ME WIND
THE CLOCK, PLEASE.

18:48.002 --> 18:51.620
CAN I GET SOMETHING
FOR YOU, GRANDPA?

18:51.672 --> 18:55.757
I WON'T NEED ANYTHING.

19:00.640 --> 19:05.180
DON'T WORRY, MARNIE,
IT'S, IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.101
BETTER?

19:15.404 --> 19:16.986
GOOD NIGHT, GRANDPA.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.740
GOOD NIGHT, SWEETHEART.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.513
IT IS...

19:40.596 --> 19:43.054
IT IS BETTER THIS WAY.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.054
IT HAS TO COME SOMETIME.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.277
AND I WANT IT
TO COME FOR ME HERE.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.028
[clock ticking slowly]

20:08.958 --> 20:10.119
[ticking stops]

20:38.571 --> 20:42.439
SAM, OLD FRIEND...

20:42.533 --> 20:45.821
IT'S BEEN A GOOD LIFE.

20:45.911 --> 20:49.950
BUT NOW IT'S
TIME TO GO.

20:50.040 --> 20:54.409
WELL, DON'T LET
ME DETAIN YOU.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.453
HOVV THE HECK DID YOU
GET IN MY BEDROOM?

20:56.547 --> 20:59.289
<i>I DON'T BELIEVE
WE'VE BEEN INTRODUCED.</i>

21:04.555 --> 21:05.966
YOUR FACE IS FAMILIAR.

21:06.056 --> 21:09.640
I'M YOUR SPIRIT.

21:09.727 --> 21:12.139
YOUR TIME HAS COME, SAM.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.345
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE 76.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.273
DON'T GIVE ME THAT
SPIRIT OF 76 STUFF.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.355
AND WHO SAYS
IT'S MY TIME TO GO?

21:19.445 --> 21:21.857
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN VVHAT
YOUR FATHER TOLD YOU?

21:21.947 --> 21:23.483
<i>AND YOUR GRANDFATHER?</i>

21:23.574 --> 21:24.814
ABOUT WHAT?

21:24.909 --> 21:27.196
DIDN'T THEY
ALWAYS TELL YOU

21:27.286 --> 21:31.200
THAT WHEN THE CLOCK
WINDS DOWN YOU'LL DIE?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.201
YES, AND YOU
KNOW SOMETHING?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.999
I USED TO BELIEVE
THAT STUFF.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.462
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.127
THEY TOLD YOU
OFTEN ENOUGH.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.500
<i>BUT THAT'S SILLY.</i>

21:39.590 --> 21:40.955
<i>DON'T YOU
KNOW THAT?</i>

21:41.008 --> 21:42.339
I DO.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.633
I'VE BEEN TO
A PSYCHIATRIST.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.464
WELL, SO WHAT?

21:46.514 --> 21:49.222
SO HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T
THINK I NEEDED THE CLOCK.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.720
AND HE DIDN'T
THINK I WAS CRAZY.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.142
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:53.229 --> 21:54.890
HE WAS RIGHT
AND WE'RE WRONG.

21:54.980 --> 21:59.565
PERSONALLY, I NEVER TRUST
THE PSYCHIATRISTS.

21:59.652 --> 22:03.145
WELL, YOU'RE FROM
ANOTHER GENERATION.

22:03.197 --> 22:04.813
SEE, I LIVE
IN THE PRESENT.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.238
LIVE, I SAID.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.861
LOOK AT ME.

22:07.952 --> 22:11.161
YOU'RE JUST A FIGMENT
OF MY IMAGINATION.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.037
WHY, I CAN SEE
RIGHT THROUGH YOU.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.249
I'VE GOT
A GREAT-GRANDCHILD COMING.

22:20.339 --> 22:24.298
AND I PLAN TO STAY AROUND
A WHILE TO PLAY WITH HIM

22:24.385 --> 22:26.752
<i>TO, UH,
WATCH HIM GROW,</i>

22:26.846 --> 22:29.213
<i>TAKE HIM
TO SCHOOL.</i>

22:29.306 --> 22:31.843
MAYBE EVEN TO COLLEGE.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.007
<i>I REPEAT,</i>

22:33.102 --> 22:35.218
I DON'T BELIEVE IN YOU,

22:35.312 --> 22:37.724
THEREFORE YOU
DON'T EXIST, RIGHT?

22:43.028 --> 22:44.189
<i>RIGHT.</i>

22:57.751 --> 22:59.082
MARNIE!

23:04.633 --> 23:06.886
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP
THIS TIME OF THE NIGHT?

23:06.927 --> 23:09.385
IWAS WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, GRANDPA.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.841
THE THING
TO WORRY ABOUT

23:10.931 --> 23:12.922
IS THAT GREAT-GRANDCHILD
OF MINE.

23:13.017 --> 23:15.600
NOW, YOU LET ME UP,
LET ME OUT OF THIS BED.

23:15.686 --> 23:16.972
MY GOODNESS,

23:17.062 --> 23:19.599
YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT ME.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.476
COME ON DOWNSTAIRS
AND I'LL GET YOU

23:21.567 --> 23:23.399
A GOOD CUP
OF HOT CHOCOLATE.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.731
BE CAREFUL OF THE STEPS.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.441
YOU MUST BE CAREFUL.

23:28.532 --> 23:31.274
IT'S MY GREAT-GRANDCHILD.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.699
LOOK OUT.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.495
MARNIE?

23:36.582 --> 23:39.244
I THINK I CHEATED
YOUR FRIENDS.

23:39.293 --> 23:41.409
THAT OLD CLOCK
HASN'T BEEN RUNNING RIGHT

23:41.503 --> 23:44.416
FOR THE LAST 4O YEARS.

23:44.506 --> 23:47.419
WHY, IT'S TAKEN EVERYTHING
I EVER LEARNED IN CLOCKMAKING

23:47.468 --> 23:49.004
JUST TO KEEP IT GOING.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.506
REALLY, GRAN DPA?

23:51.597 --> 23:54.009
UH, AS A MATTER OF FACT,

23:54.099 --> 23:56.761
IT STOPPED TICKING
FOR THE LAST TIME

23:56.810 --> 23:58.972
JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.349
HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT?

24:00.439 --> 24:03.431
OH, DON'T ASK
ME HOW I KNOW,

24:03.525 --> 24:04.981
BUT I KNOW.

24:05.069 --> 24:09.154
AND A STRANGE THING
HAPPENED, MARNIE.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.776
WHEN THAT CLOCK DIED,

24:11.825 --> 24:14.863
I WAS BORN AGAIN.

24:14.954 --> 24:18.618
