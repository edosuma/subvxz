WEBVTT

00:01.298 --> 00:06.057
You fools! You have trifled with me,
but now you will suffer!

00:06.389 --> 00:07.932
Pop quiz!

00:08.198 --> 00:11.221
Put your books away.

00:14.818 --> 00:17.862
Do you think Ock developed his
finely tuned grumpiness over time,

00:17.971 --> 00:20.648
- or was he just born this way?
- I just think he's still grumpy

00:20.828 --> 00:24.298
because Max sent him back to the drawing
board on his mechanical arms project.

00:24.491 --> 00:27.243
Nah. I'm saying
he was born this way.

00:27.333 --> 00:30.335
His first words were probably, 
"This diaper design is ineffectual."

00:30.422 --> 00:32.219
You two
have him all wrong.

00:32.305 --> 00:34.160
Out of all the teachers
here at Horizon,

00:34.243 --> 00:37.093
Otto cares the most
about his students.

00:37.304 --> 00:38.320
Hmph!

00:38.437 --> 00:39.799
You call this caring?

00:39.867 --> 00:42.711
Who were you raised by,
a pack of crazed zombie wolves?

00:42.804 --> 00:46.093
He's just misunderstood. You guys
probably don't know what that's like.

00:46.211 --> 00:48.971
I know what it's like to turn in
a brilliant prototype

00:49.047 --> 00:50.728
for my High-Frequency
Energy Reader,

00:50.811 --> 00:53.671
and have Ock give me a "C" because
it didn't have a cooler name.

00:53.811 --> 00:56.147
Ugh!
 How do I get out of this test?

00:56.233 --> 00:58.584
We can always hope
for an act of nature.

00:59.945 --> 01:01.507
<i>Attention, students.</i>

01:01.609 --> 01:04.132
<i>Horizon High is experiencing
an emergency.</i>

01:04.233 --> 01:07.439
<i>Drop everything
and follow standard evacuating procedures.</i>

01:07.507 --> 01:08.850
What's going on here?

01:08.918 --> 01:11.608
Who cares, 
as long as the quiz is canceled.

01:11.710 --> 01:14.710
This only means the quiz
is postponed!

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.906 --> 01:29.676
Well, so much
for an act of nature.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.109
Organized evacuation's
great for safety,

01:32.257 --> 01:35.093
terrible for changing
into Spider-Man.

01:36.241 --> 01:40.353
You do know Horizon has a front door,
reception desk, and the whole works, right?

01:40.444 --> 01:43.851
And you have to sign in to get a
hall pass, Mr.... What's your name?

01:43.919 --> 01:48.273
Miss Crimson Dynamo.
And this is my hall pass!

01:48.351 --> 01:49.507
Not what I meant!

01:55.726 --> 01:59.515
<font color=#FF00FF>*Marvel's SPIDER-MAN*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 01   Episode 15</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Rise of Doc Ock, Part 1"</font>

02:04.187 --> 02:07.225
If this is how you make
a first impression...

02:09.169 --> 02:11.677
you're gonna be
hugely unpopular at Horizon.

02:11.849 --> 02:15.318
I do not care about this school,
only what it is hiding.

02:15.490 --> 02:20.482
Can't we talk about this over scones?
Green tea? Borscht? On me.

02:20.771 --> 02:22.141
You waste my time.

02:22.255 --> 02:24.364
Sure, time's
a terrible thing to waste,

02:24.470 --> 02:27.482
but you've got no problem
wasting doors and ceilings!

02:28.998 --> 02:30.896
Enough foolishness.

02:30.998 --> 02:33.779
You will impede me
no further!

02:40.591 --> 02:43.356
This building is harder
to breach than I imagined.

02:43.489 --> 02:46.255
But every security grid
has a weak spot.

02:46.465 --> 02:47.981
There!

02:54.002 --> 02:57.991
Ugh! Even Ock's pop quiz would've
been more fun than this.

03:00.499 --> 03:03.688
Now we're playing hide-and-seek?
You are one weird super-villain.

03:03.888 --> 03:06.489
Bet you can't hide
from infrared.

03:07.640 --> 03:10.628
Wow. Good thing
that wasn't a real bet.

03:10.828 --> 03:13.168
Can't find her anywhere.
Wait!

03:13.266 --> 03:16.355
I'm thinking Miles's High-Frequency
Energy Reader will do the trick.

03:16.742 --> 03:19.051
Boy, that is a mouthful.

03:19.411 --> 03:21.574
Ock had a point about the name.

03:21.926 --> 03:24.155
If you're emitting
an energy signal,

03:24.223 --> 03:26.207
a little twist
of the dial should...

03:26.327 --> 03:29.065
Boom! Huh?
Running a little low

03:29.199 --> 03:31.043
on batteries in our big,
red armor, aren't we?

03:31.137 --> 03:35.012
Whoa! Now I'm picking up a massive
high energy source in the basement?

03:35.192 --> 03:37.488
Bet that's what
Crimson Dynamite's looking for.

03:37.688 --> 03:41.680
"Dynamo." And thank you
for locating it for me.

03:41.797 --> 03:42.886
Aah!

03:49.528 --> 03:51.008
Finally.

03:54.051 --> 03:56.843
Somehow I doubt you have
permission to access complex,

03:56.911 --> 03:58.663
most likely
dangerous machinery.

03:58.731 --> 04:00.755
But maybe I'm
just being paranoid.

04:01.074 --> 04:05.301
I have not come this far to be
stopped by a boy in a clown costume.

04:05.395 --> 04:08.160
Have you ever
seen a clown?

04:11.661 --> 04:15.304
I mean, I'm as charming and whimsical
as a clown, but there are differences.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.887
They have floppy shoes and noses that
honk, and... they can't do this!

04:20.089 --> 04:22.615
Well, maybe they can
in Cirque du Spi-day.

04:22.732 --> 04:26.477
What's the point? I'm arguing with
someone in second-rate Iron Man armor.

04:26.599 --> 04:32.669
My armor is far superior to the work
of that imperialist swine, Tony Stark.

04:35.474 --> 04:38.333
You will hold me back
no longer.

04:38.783 --> 04:40.622
End of the line!

04:42.161 --> 04:43.272
No!

04:43.469 --> 04:45.185
My power is drained!

04:45.262 --> 04:48.466
Yeah, I noticed you were running a
little low when I scanned you earlier.

04:49.642 --> 04:51.446
That was easier
than I thought.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.774
Is it safe to
come in, Spider-Man?

04:53.993 --> 04:58.532
She's drained of power and completely
harmless, thank you very much.

04:59.454 --> 05:01.159
How are we
gonna move that thing?

05:01.227 --> 05:04.017
That... I don't know.

05:04.379 --> 05:06.579
Is this what
she was after?

05:07.909 --> 05:10.626
I've never seen this
machine before in my life.

05:10.937 --> 05:12.348
I'm not exactly sure
what it does,

05:12.416 --> 05:14.563
but it's emitting
really large amounts of energy.

05:14.685 --> 05:18.673
A weapon, maybe? Of course
it's not a weapon, dunderhead!

05:18.798 --> 05:21.409
It's a revolutionary
power generator

05:21.477 --> 05:24.243
that utilizes
regenerative ion technology.

05:24.364 --> 05:26.454
When I am finished,

05:26.720 --> 05:28.594
it will change the world.

05:28.774 --> 05:31.448
I call it the R.I.O.T. 3.

05:31.735 --> 05:33.681
Regenerative ions?

05:33.837 --> 05:36.322
Do you know how volatile
that is?

05:36.522 --> 05:40.001
Our whole school could implode
in a vortex of swirling atoms!

05:40.165 --> 05:42.634
In the hands
of a lesser mind, yes,

05:42.727 --> 05:45.462
but I have taken
every precaution.

05:45.696 --> 05:48.665
No. Dismantle
this immediately.

05:50.227 --> 05:53.415
Maybe we, uh, lift it
outta here with a crane?

05:53.571 --> 05:54.845
Back a truck in?

05:54.938 --> 05:57.294
I wanna arrest her,
not tow her.

05:57.494 --> 05:59.391
Thank you, comrades.

05:59.470 --> 06:03.753
Your inane banter provided me the
time needed to reboot my system

06:03.829 --> 06:06.704
with a small but much needed
power reserve.

06:06.790 --> 06:08.480
Now get out of the way.

06:08.548 --> 06:10.435
I need to fully charge.

06:10.642 --> 06:14.017
Looks like somebody doesn't get
when they're not wanted.

06:17.173 --> 06:20.251
Max, Otto, get to
safety with the others!

06:26.009 --> 06:27.977
What you want doesn't matter

06:28.048 --> 06:31.251
in the face of the power
I will now wield.

06:33.329 --> 06:34.652
No, no, no, no!

06:34.720 --> 06:38.071
You're overloading
the transmission conduits, fool!

06:40.110 --> 06:42.886
Stop messing with...
Hey!

06:43.206 --> 06:45.257
We gotta find a way
to shut it down.

06:45.457 --> 06:49.440
Octavius, now is not the time
to be checking your e-mails!

06:49.948 --> 06:53.284
I'm doing something
much more ingenious.

06:53.534 --> 06:55.788
What? What have you done?

06:55.904 --> 07:00.858
I remotely expanded the generator's
energy shield, entrapping you.

07:01.049 --> 07:03.964
I will not be captured.

07:06.608 --> 07:09.663
<i>Danger.
Meltdown in 30 seconds.</i>

07:09.936 --> 07:14.819
<i>- 29. 28. 27. 26.</i>
- <i>Do svdidanya,</i> Man-Spider.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.623
- Here. Have a parting gift.
- <i>25.</i>

07:17.756 --> 07:20.623
Thanks to my Spider Tracer,
I'll be able to track her down later.

07:20.872 --> 07:23.388
- Assuming there is a later!
- <i>22. 21.</i>

07:24.147 --> 07:26.512
- <i>21</i>.
- Okay, think, Spidey.

07:26.605 --> 07:28.608
What do I know about
defusing overloads... - 20.

07:28.676 --> 07:30.070
- In regenerative ion tech?
- <i>19.</i>

07:30.270 --> 07:32.757
- There must be...
- <i>18.</i>

07:32.825 --> 07:34.981
- Fuel rods! If I can take them out,
- <i>17.</i>

07:35.083 --> 07:36.770
- That should avert the overload.
- <i>16.</i>

07:36.847 --> 07:39.629
- You're doing it wrong, ignoramus!
- <i>15.</i>

07:39.779 --> 07:42.926
- <i>14. 13.</i>
- Okay.

07:43.410 --> 07:46.965
I've gotta get these rods out before...
Whoa! Let an expert work.

07:47.153 --> 07:48.660
- Whoa!
- <i>Ten.</i>

07:48.801 --> 07:51.379
- <i>Nine. Eight.</i>
- Your mechanical arms! But...

07:51.447 --> 07:55.561
You fool! Decoupling the rods in an
improper sequence... - <i>Seven. Six.</i>

07:55.629 --> 07:57.314
- Could destroy my generator!
- <i>Five.</i>

07:57.993 --> 08:00.586
- Otto! Let me help!
- <i>Four. Three.</i>

08:00.786 --> 08:02.306
- You don't have to do it alone!
- <i>Two.</i>

08:02.436 --> 08:04.180
- I just need more time to...
- <i>One.</i>

08:04.248 --> 08:07.124
No!

08:19.549 --> 08:21.838
We're lucky
no students were hurt.

08:21.984 --> 08:25.268
I warned him against
unsanctioned experiments.

08:25.676 --> 08:28.010
You did everything you could,
Spider-Man.

08:29.012 --> 08:31.018
There's one more thing
I can do:

08:31.260 --> 08:33.602
find the criminal responsible!

08:42.361 --> 08:43.813
Nothing!

08:44.096 --> 08:45.998
I thought I perfected
this tracer.

08:46.134 --> 08:48.416
So how come
I've been chasing ghost signals

08:48.486 --> 08:50.330
up and down Manhattan
for hours?

08:50.639 --> 08:51.778
<i>Dr. Wacker,</i>

08:51.846 --> 08:54.157
- <i>please report to the E.R., Code Blue.</i>
- Gwen.

08:55.140 --> 08:57.943
- How is he?
- The doctors are with him now.

08:58.064 --> 09:02.658
They asked me to wait outside.
But he's not exactly in good spirits.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.400
Well, that's nothing new.

09:04.468 --> 09:07.121
But nearly blowing up the school
with your unsanctioned

09:07.189 --> 09:09.213
experimental generator
can be a real bummer.

09:09.314 --> 09:12.432
Blow us up?
Crimson Dynamo did that.

09:12.595 --> 09:15.775
Dr. Octavius put himself in
harm's way to try and save us.

09:15.977 --> 09:19.063
- He even saved Spider-Man.
- "Saved Spider-Man"?

09:19.131 --> 09:22.686
Otto was just trying to get him out of the
way so he could save his precious machine.

09:22.807 --> 09:26.236
Of course he wanted to save
his machine, and our lives.

09:28.174 --> 09:30.450
I know he's not always
the nicest guy.

09:30.518 --> 09:32.611
But I was there, Peter.
I saw it.

09:32.717 --> 09:35.877
He intentionally
threw Spidey away from danger.

09:36.189 --> 09:39.045
Dr. Octavius
acted like a hero.

09:39.714 --> 09:41.424
Good guy Otto?

09:41.501 --> 09:44.251
I guess that's
a possible hypothesis.

09:46.658 --> 09:47.958
I can't wait anymore.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.385
I've gotta get back.

09:49.790 --> 09:53.533
But... tell him how grateful
we all are.

09:56.416 --> 09:58.572
Thank you, Doctor,
so much for the consult.

09:58.871 --> 10:01.692
Appreciate it. Of course.
Let's continue to monitor his vitals.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.275
Uh, hey, Doc.

10:03.354 --> 10:05.346
Great to see you
looking better.

10:05.414 --> 10:08.260
Do not patronize me,
Parker.

10:08.393 --> 10:12.174
Yeah. Okay.
So, what did they say?

10:12.424 --> 10:16.268
The so-called medical professionals
at this establishment

10:16.486 --> 10:21.283
have just informed me that they cannot
remove these metal arms... ever.

10:21.394 --> 10:23.979
The explosion fused them
with my nervous system.

10:24.047 --> 10:25.777
I'm stuck like this
for life.

10:25.864 --> 10:27.450
I'm sure you can still...

10:27.518 --> 10:29.735
Still what?
Still be an outcast?

10:29.840 --> 10:33.408
This accident has made me more
of a freak than I already was.

10:33.501 --> 10:37.259
My small-minded peers have mocked
my differences since youth.

10:37.369 --> 10:41.408
<i>These</i> will only give them
more cause.

10:41.876 --> 10:43.680
My Uncle Ben used to say

10:43.774 --> 10:47.518
that accidents can either
be endings or beginnings.

10:48.354 --> 10:51.158
Your uncle clearly
wasn't a scientist.

10:51.541 --> 10:54.611
No. But he wasn't
a quitter either.

10:54.797 --> 10:57.600
Sure, you can give up and sulk
for the rest of your life.

10:57.745 --> 11:00.455
But you should know,
no matter what's happened to you,

11:00.525 --> 11:04.067
there are people out there,
like Gwen and the students at Horizon,

11:04.135 --> 11:08.307
who believe in you,
who think you can change the world.

11:08.546 --> 11:10.650
Maybe even as a hero.

11:11.143 --> 11:14.322
And what do you think,
Parker?

11:14.393 --> 11:16.463
I think they're right.

11:16.623 --> 11:18.939
I... I don't know.

11:19.007 --> 11:22.348
I'm not even sure how to stop
Crimson Dynamo if she comes back.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.088
Why would she come back?

11:24.197 --> 11:26.759
I evaluated her armor
during the attack.

11:26.810 --> 11:28.518
It's an inefficient design.

11:28.595 --> 11:32.752
The fuel rods I invented for my
generator would maximize her suit.

11:33.416 --> 11:35.768
Giving her
a major power upgrade.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.002
But the generator
was destroyed.

11:38.136 --> 11:40.057
- The one at the school was,
- yes.

11:40.264 --> 11:41.979
But my earlier prototypes,

11:42.059 --> 11:44.994
R.I.O.T. 1 and 2,
are in off-site storage.

11:45.127 --> 11:46.763
They give off
a smaller signature,

11:46.831 --> 11:49.249
but she'll
detect them eventually.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.671
Then there's a good chance
we know where she's going to be.

11:51.739 --> 11:53.226
And we'll have
a chance to stop her.

11:53.294 --> 11:56.153
Spider-Man will
take care of it, I'm sure.

11:56.450 --> 11:59.724
I have nothing to offer.

12:05.482 --> 12:09.353
Aah! Stakeouts are boring.
Three hours, and nada.

12:09.577 --> 12:12.684
I've gotta remember to borrow
Miles's game-pad next time.

12:13.794 --> 12:14.974
Huh.

12:15.075 --> 12:18.200
And my brilliantly designed tracer
couldn't be more useless.

12:18.403 --> 12:19.969
According to this,
she's right behind me.

12:20.036 --> 12:22.903
Which is not true,
or my Spider-Sense would...

12:23.243 --> 12:24.891
do that!

12:27.739 --> 12:31.716
Leave! I do not want
to hurt you or anyone.

12:31.837 --> 12:33.701
But I will if I must.

12:33.859 --> 12:36.382
Have to say, you're not doing
great on the "hurt nobody" front.

12:36.450 --> 12:39.169
A brilliant scientist is
in the hospital because of you.

12:39.282 --> 12:41.800
He tried to deny me
what I needed.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.900
I was a victim
in my country.

12:43.987 --> 12:47.840
Mobsters took everything I had,
even my family's land.

12:48.040 --> 12:52.372
I seized this armor so that
I will never be vulnerable again.

12:55.864 --> 12:59.622
The power source is the key to
unlocking features of the armor

12:59.818 --> 13:02.739
that cannot be generated
with conventional energy.

13:02.939 --> 13:05.849
I will use that extra strength
to become rich

13:05.991 --> 13:09.224
so that no one will push
me or my family around again.

13:09.403 --> 13:11.563
I lost someone
I cared about to crime,

13:11.631 --> 13:13.747
so I know what it feels like
to be powerless.

13:13.817 --> 13:16.083
But you don't fight crime
with more crime.

13:16.192 --> 13:18.484
You fight crime
by becoming a hero!

13:18.552 --> 13:21.067
A hero?
I am a thief.

13:21.192 --> 13:23.794
Recently, the meanest guy
I know saved my life.

13:23.994 --> 13:26.356
Sometimes people
surprise you.

13:26.773 --> 13:29.694
Yes, they do.
They act like friends,

13:29.941 --> 13:32.786
and then they betray you!

13:38.231 --> 13:40.013
I can't let you take that!

13:40.231 --> 13:42.093
You can't stop me.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.083
Now you look like a nightlight.

13:50.153 --> 13:52.497
Am I supposed to be impressed?

13:53.982 --> 13:56.474
Okay.
I'm a little impressed.

13:56.541 --> 13:58.541
<i>Like that?
Try this.</i>

13:58.684 --> 14:01.247
I finally have enough power
to use them.?

14:01.669 --> 14:04.101
Dynamo Drones, launch!

14:04.169 --> 14:07.434
Now you know
what I speak of, Spider-Man.

14:07.653 --> 14:09.239
Strength.

14:10.292 --> 14:12.083
Aah!

14:13.083 --> 14:14.770
When Dr. Octavius asks,

14:14.838 --> 14:16.927
I am so telling him
you broke all his stuff.

14:16.995 --> 14:19.835
Note to self:
always beat the bad guy

14:19.903 --> 14:22.591
<i>before</i> they get
a massive power upgrade.

14:23.789 --> 14:26.825
Crimson Dynamo,
you're new to New York, right?

14:28.708 --> 14:30.833
Instead of fighting,
how about I take you on a tour?

14:30.989 --> 14:34.463
Show you the sights. Catch a show.

14:34.810 --> 14:37.747
I'll take that
as a "No, thank you, Spidey."

14:38.762 --> 14:40.059
Whoa!

14:41.276 --> 14:42.473
Huh?

14:42.541 --> 14:44.583
Otto?
Awesome!

14:44.934 --> 14:48.099
You are trying to purloin
what does not belong to you.

14:48.263 --> 14:52.052
You now face the Octopus!

14:52.255 --> 14:53.645
You again?

14:53.713 --> 14:56.467
You believe metal arms
are power?

14:56.563 --> 14:59.513
Drones, attack!

15:09.519 --> 15:12.092
You saved me. Again.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.357
Who's the superhero here,
me or you?

15:14.425 --> 15:18.990
The least likeliest student helped make me
aware I was not as helpless as I thought.

15:19.215 --> 15:23.576
But I am no hero.
I merely came to protect my property.

15:24.566 --> 15:26.459
As "The Octopus," huh?

15:26.568 --> 15:28.620
It is an expression
of wry humor,

15:28.797 --> 15:31.021
playing off the first syllable
of my last name

15:31.107 --> 15:33.654
and referencing the number
of limbs I now possess.

15:33.722 --> 15:35.685
Yeah, I got that.

15:35.864 --> 15:38.959
If it weren't for you, I'd be toast.
Spider-toast.

15:39.123 --> 15:41.349
Which is gross.
So thank you.

15:41.559 --> 15:43.271
Nevertheless, we failed.

15:43.435 --> 15:46.110
Crimson Dynamo
escaped with my technology

15:46.178 --> 15:49.498
and can utilize it for any nefarious
purpose that she pleases.

15:49.584 --> 15:53.295
I managed to plant a tracer on her,
but it's not working.

15:55.115 --> 15:58.110
Bring your amateurish device
back to my lab,

15:58.178 --> 16:00.670
where I am certain
I can correct its flaws.

16:00.771 --> 16:03.524
Aah!
You mean a team-up?

16:03.717 --> 16:06.342
Umm, More of a temporary,

16:06.529 --> 16:10.178
very limited partnership
that I will most likely regret.

16:10.482 --> 16:12.021
Not as catchy.

16:13.092 --> 16:14.721
Hmm...

16:15.294 --> 16:17.240
This tracer's circuit

16:17.357 --> 16:20.037
is not as incompetently
assembled as I assumed.

16:20.123 --> 16:21.803
But even
a malfunctioning timepiece

16:21.928 --> 16:24.436
displays a correct
chrono-reading twice daily.

16:24.576 --> 16:28.053
I take it your PhD
isn't in giving compliments.

16:29.053 --> 16:31.131
Hey, I found something
on the Crimson Dynamo.

16:31.341 --> 16:33.326
Government designs,
as I deduced?

16:33.443 --> 16:36.508
Yep. The armor was designed
to protect people,

16:36.576 --> 16:40.032
but was recently stolen
by a "Galina Nermirovsky"...

16:40.100 --> 16:41.399
- A civilian.
- Hmm.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.227
Then she is
likely untrained

16:43.295 --> 16:45.313
in the finer aspects
of the armor.

16:45.381 --> 16:47.922
- Hmm.
- Perhaps she's incorrectly

16:47.990 --> 16:49.977
cycled the armor's
junction boxes,

16:50.045 --> 16:52.399
resulting in interference
with your tracer.

16:52.467 --> 16:56.146
There! I have made the
proper adjustment.

16:56.326 --> 16:58.678
Doc, you're a genius!

16:59.678 --> 17:01.438
Why do people say that

17:01.506 --> 17:04.036
with such surprise
in their voices?

17:07.438 --> 17:09.859
The vault should be right...

17:10.242 --> 17:11.940
there!

17:12.008 --> 17:14.133
Trying to rob a bank?

17:14.313 --> 17:16.376
Don't bank on it.

17:16.773 --> 17:19.535
See, you have to come up with one-liners
like that when you're a hero.

17:19.626 --> 17:21.792
It helps sell your good-guy-ness.

17:22.148 --> 17:25.355
The Octopus and his sidekick,
Spider-Man?

17:25.563 --> 17:27.445
Wha... <i>His</i> sidekick?

17:27.548 --> 17:30.001
He's been doing this for, like, an hour.
Two hours.

17:30.227 --> 17:32.649
Enough!

17:34.212 --> 17:37.425
We need to wrap this up before
she causes significant damage.

17:37.493 --> 17:41.055
Damage?
I'll show you damage!

17:41.696 --> 17:43.306
Uh...

17:47.673 --> 17:50.868
Sheesh!
Instead of "Crimson Dynamo,"

17:51.024 --> 17:53.253
I'm gonna start calling you
"Collateral Damage."

17:53.321 --> 17:55.930
That way, you don't have to change
the monogram on your towels.

17:56.024 --> 17:59.172
You are but
a petty annoyance.

18:02.260 --> 18:08.073
An annoyance, for certain.
But for the moment, he is my ally.

18:10.682 --> 18:12.838
You and your ally
are tiresome.

18:12.987 --> 18:15.596
But this will keep you busy.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.419
I can save
those clueless dolts.

18:21.571 --> 18:24.526
You must stop
Crimson Dynamo.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.049
Otto saving people.
It's a crazy world.

18:31.487 --> 18:33.518
I'm sorry for what happened
to you, Galina.

18:33.729 --> 18:36.690
From what you said, it
sounds like you lost a lot.

18:37.526 --> 18:41.745
But you can choose whether that
makes you a hero or a villain.

18:45.307 --> 18:47.768
I've made my choice.

18:56.353 --> 18:57.876
Whoa!

18:59.112 --> 19:00.653
My tracer!

19:00.721 --> 19:02.935
Ock said something on your armor
interfered with it.

19:03.338 --> 19:05.213
Is the opposite true?

19:05.659 --> 19:08.618
- Could my tracer interfere with your armor?
- What tracer?

19:09.747 --> 19:11.662
What are you doing?

19:11.855 --> 19:12.969
No!

19:13.037 --> 19:14.952
Reverse output worked!

19:15.039 --> 19:17.494
I wonder if I could get
extra credit for this.

19:17.936 --> 19:19.737
Your task appears...

19:20.729 --> 19:22.416
complete.

19:23.034 --> 19:25.526
Is that Octavius
for "good job"?

19:26.946 --> 19:29.049
What do we do at this juncture?

19:29.354 --> 19:33.002
I usually leave a note
for the police and get out.

19:33.314 --> 19:35.799
Uh, got a pen?

19:38.002 --> 19:41.104
We got the bad guy.
Nice team-up, Octopus.

19:41.172 --> 19:45.893
I achieved my desired intention...
retrieving that which is mine.

19:46.121 --> 19:49.076
Don't think I didn't see you
save those people, Doc.

19:49.237 --> 19:52.393
That had nothing to do
with getting your tech back.

19:52.669 --> 19:55.752
Face it.
You're a hero.

19:55.996 --> 19:58.440
Hmm. Perhaps.

19:58.671 --> 20:00.705
Never doubted it.

20:02.448 --> 20:04.640
You realize
the world's meanest teacher

20:04.708 --> 20:06.737
is still gonna give us
that killer quiz, right?

20:07.338 --> 20:08.925
We should be so lucky.

20:08.993 --> 20:10.479
He just got out
of the hospital.

20:10.547 --> 20:12.534
He'll probably wanna
take it easy for a while.

20:12.739 --> 20:16.377
I wouldn't be surprised if
Dr. Octavius is a little kinder now.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.951
People can
choose to change.

20:23.804 --> 20:25.443
A-A-Ahem!

20:25.511 --> 20:28.615
Because you are all
no doubt wondering,

20:28.683 --> 20:32.419
no, I will not
be giving you a pop quiz.

20:32.934 --> 20:34.059
Whew!

20:34.134 --> 20:37.052
I will be giving you
<i>two</i> of them!

20:38.783 --> 20:39.783
Huh?

20:39.919 --> 20:42.916
Peter Parker,
I need to see you.

20:43.428 --> 20:48.066
Mr. Parker.
I know your secret.

20:48.547 --> 20:50.380
You... You do?

20:50.448 --> 20:52.310
Spider-Man

20:52.834 --> 20:56.466
put this tracer
on Crimson Dynamo.

20:56.753 --> 20:59.790
Did you really think I would not
recognize the project you built

20:59.858 --> 21:02.628
from my electrical
engineering class?

21:02.836 --> 21:05.485
Parker, I know...

21:06.048 --> 21:07.888
that you are...

21:08.124 --> 21:10.919
building tech for Spider-Man.

21:11.196 --> 21:13.536
Oh! Uh, yeah.

21:13.790 --> 21:16.521
I've helped Spidey
once or twice... I guess.

21:16.722 --> 21:19.779
Interesting.
Having a brilliant mind of my own,

21:19.847 --> 21:22.263
I have no need
for outside contributions.

21:22.400 --> 21:26.333
Perhaps one would say
that makes me the superior hero.

21:28.943 --> 21:32.185
Good to have you back,
Dr. Octavius.
