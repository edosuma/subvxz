TODAY IS THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL

00:40.764 --> 00:43.765
AND THAT THE LAST DAY
OF SCHOOL INVOLVES PRANKS,

00:43.767 --> 00:45.366
BUT THIS IS
GOING TOO FAR.

00:45.368 --> 00:48.970
NOW WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE WITH MR. HAT?

00:48.972 --> 00:51.839
CHILDREN, I WANT MR. HAT
BACK RIGHT NOW!

00:51.841 --> 00:54.309
THE PRANK
IS OVER!

00:54.311 --> 00:57.312
YOU THINK I CAN'T GET ALONG
WITH MR. HAT, DON'T YOU?

00:57.314 --> 00:59.280
YOU THINK I CAN'T
LIVE WITHOUT HIM.

00:59.282 --> 01:00.081
WELL, I CAN.

01:00.083 --> 01:00.982
HE'S JUST A PUPPET.

01:00.984 --> 01:02.083
I DON'T
NEED HIM.

01:02.085 --> 01:06.120
YOU SEE, WATCH.

01:11.328 --> 01:13.761
GODDAMNIT, WHERE THE --
DID YOU PUT MR. HAT?

01:13.763 --> 01:15.263
( bell ringing )

01:15.265 --> 01:16.264
OH, NO
YOU DON'T.

01:16.266 --> 01:18.600
THE SCHOOL YEAR'S OVER BUT
SUMMER VACATION DOESN'T START

01:18.602 --> 01:22.570
FOR YOU LITTLE BASTARDS UNTIL
MR. HAT IS BACK ON MY DESK.

01:22.572 --> 01:23.538
( together )
AHHHH!

01:23.540 --> 01:24.839
NOW I'M GONNA
TURN AROUND

01:24.841 --> 01:25.807
AND WHEN
I TURN BACK

01:25.809 --> 01:29.444
I EXPECT TO SEE MR. HAT
LYING RIGHT HERE.

01:29.446 --> 01:30.111
OKAY.

01:30.113 --> 01:32.513
NOW I'M GONNA
TURN AROUND NOW.

01:34.751 --> 01:35.350
SHIT!

01:35.352 --> 01:36.718
WHERE DID
EVERYBODY GO?

01:36.720 --> 01:38.052
HOORAY!

01:38.054 --> 01:39.487
SUMMER!

01:41.458 --> 01:43.725
OH, GOLLY,
KEVIN, HONEY.

01:43.727 --> 01:46.127
GOOD TO SEE
YOU AGAIN, SON.

01:48.632 --> 01:51.299
LOOKS LIKE WINTER'S
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

01:51.301 --> 01:54.469
BETTER GET SOME
FIREWOOD READY.

01:57.907 --> 01:59.641
OH, HAPPY SUMMER,
GENTLEMEN.

01:59.643 --> 02:00.642
SHUT UP, PIP.

02:00.644 --> 02:01.376
RIGHTO.

02:01.378 --> 02:02.777
ENJOY SOME OF THE SUMMER
FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

02:02.779 --> 02:03.845
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?

02:03.847 --> 02:05.213
WELL, I HAVE TO SPEND MY
SUMMER IN SUMMER SCHOOL

02:05.215 --> 02:06.314
BECAUSE I CAN'T
BE LEFT ALONE.

02:06.316 --> 02:08.416
YOU SEE MY
PARENTS ARE DEAD.

02:08.418 --> 02:11.519
YOUR PARENTS ARE DEAD?
GODDAMN YOU, SIR PIP.

02:11.521 --> 02:13.855
( laughing )

02:16.159 --> 02:16.958
OH, YEAH, DUDE.

02:16.960 --> 02:17.725
IT'S SUMMER.

02:17.727 --> 02:18.993
THAT MEANS WE GOTTA
BUY FIREWORKS.

02:18.995 --> 02:20.995
I SAVED UP ENOUGH MONEY
TO BUY<i> M80'S</i> THIS YEAR.

02:20.997 --> 02:21.996
I SAW THIS
MOVIE ONCE

02:21.998 --> 02:24.165
WHERE THIS GUY STUCK A FIRE
CRACKER UP A CAT'S BUTT.

02:24.167 --> 02:25.833
COOL, MAYBE WE CAN DO
THAT TO CARTMAN'S CAT.

02:25.835 --> 02:28.369
HEY, IF YOU SO MUCH
AS TOUCH KITTY'S ASS,

02:28.371 --> 02:30.438
I'LL PUT FIRE CRACKERS
IN YOUR NUT-SACK

02:30.440 --> 02:33.107
AND BLOW YOUR BALLS
ALL OVER YOUR PANTS.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.275
JESUS,
CARTMAN.

02:34.277 --> 02:36.911
( mumbling )

02:38.114 --> 02:39.113
HI FELLAS.

02:39.115 --> 02:39.814
HI.

02:39.816 --> 02:40.882
WHAT CAN I
DO FOR YOU?

02:40.884 --> 02:41.849
WE WANT TO
BUY<i> M80'S</i>.

02:41.851 --> 02:43.651
THE KIND THAT FIT IN
CARTMAN'S CAT'S ASS.

02:43.653 --> 02:44.519
OKAY,
THAT'S IT.

02:44.521 --> 02:47.955
SCREW YOU GUYS,
I'M GOING HOME.

02:47.957 --> 02:48.690
WHAT A BABY.

02:48.692 --> 02:49.824
SO WE'LL HAVE
TEN<i> M80'S</i> PLEASE.

02:49.826 --> 02:51.659
I'M SORRY FELLAS,
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?

02:51.661 --> 02:52.460
HEARD WHAT?

02:52.462 --> 02:54.462
ALL FIREWORKS HAVE BEEN
BANNED IN COLORADO.

02:54.464 --> 02:55.329
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?

02:55.331 --> 02:56.564
IT WAS IN THE
PAPER THIS MORNING.

02:56.566 --> 02:59.434
DUDE, JUST CAUSE SOME
STUPID NORTH PARK KID
BLEW HIS HANDS OFF,

02:59.436 --> 03:01.202
WE DON'T GET
TO BUY<i> M80'S</i>.

03:01.204 --> 03:01.869
RIGHT.

03:01.871 --> 03:02.804
HOW CAN THEY
DO THIS TO US?

03:02.806 --> 03:04.172
DOESN'T ANYONE BELIEVE
IN TRADITION ANYMORE?

03:04.174 --> 03:07.508
YEAH, WE'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH
FIRE CRACKERS OUR WHOLE LIVES.

03:12.449 --> 03:14.182
KILLED KENNY.

03:14.184 --> 03:16.784
YOU BASTARDS.

03:16.786 --> 03:18.519
A SUMMER WITHOUT
FIREWORKS IS LIKE--

03:18.521 --> 03:19.754
I DON'T KNOW
BUT IT'S LIKE

03:19.756 --> 03:20.555
IT SUCKS ASS.

03:20.557 --> 03:23.124
YEAH, NOW WHAT ARE
WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

03:23.126 --> 03:26.494
I CAN STILL
SELL SNAKES.

03:27.897 --> 03:29.597
( together )
NAH.

03:29.599 --> 03:30.431
THIS IS ABSURD.

03:30.433 --> 03:33.868
WE NEED FIREWORKS FOR OUR FOURTH
OF JULY CELEBRATION AT THE LAKE.

03:33.870 --> 03:35.970
I DON'T CARE THAT SOME
TWIRP BLEW HIS HANDS OFF.

03:35.972 --> 03:39.307
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE
FIREWORKS FOR OUR PICNIC!

03:39.309 --> 03:41.375
HOLD ON I'VE
GOT ANOTHER CALL.

03:41.377 --> 03:42.009
HELLO.

03:42.011 --> 03:43.077
NO, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE MR. HAT IS.

03:43.079 --> 03:45.146
JESUS, GARRISON, I'VE
GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS.

03:45.148 --> 03:46.013
HELLO, YES.

03:46.015 --> 03:49.083
NOW WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO ABOUT OUR FOURTH OF
JULY SHOW AT THE LAKE?

03:49.085 --> 03:51.319
NO, I DON'T
WANT SNAKES.

03:51.321 --> 03:52.587
THIS IS
AN OUTRAGE.

03:52.589 --> 03:53.621
GET ME
THE MAYOR!

03:53.623 --> 03:56.591
I KNOW THAT, SMART ASS,
I WAS BEING IRONIC.

03:56.593 --> 04:00.828
I'M SORRY MAYOR, BUT I COULDN'T
FIND THE LITTLE MAN IN THE BOAT.

04:00.830 --> 04:02.263
WELL,
KEEP LOOKING.

04:02.265 --> 04:03.297
THIS IS
RIDICULOUS.

04:03.299 --> 04:05.900
WE CAN'T HAVE A CELEBRATION
WITHOUT FIREWORKS.

04:05.902 --> 04:08.202
WHOEVER HEARD OF A FOURTH
OF JULY PICNIC WITH SNAKES?

04:08.204 --> 04:12.540
( Bar Brady )
I LIKE SNAKES, YOU LIGHT
THEM AND THEY GROW AND GROW.

04:12.542 --> 04:14.709
WAIT A MINUTE,
THAT'S IT!

04:14.711 --> 04:15.576
I'VE GOT IT!

04:15.578 --> 04:18.446
THIS FOURTH OF JULY,
SOUTH PARK WILL MAKE HISTORY

04:18.448 --> 04:21.215
BY HAVING THE LARGEST
SNAKE IN THE WORLD!

04:21.217 --> 04:23.151
THE PRESS
WILL LOVE IT.

04:23.153 --> 04:24.819
I'LL BE ON
THE FRONT --

04:24.821 --> 04:25.486
OOH.

04:25.488 --> 04:27.522
( Bar Brady )
OH, I
FOUND HIM.

04:29.425 --> 04:30.458
MAN, IT'S
HOT OUT HERE.

04:30.460 --> 04:32.794
WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT TO DO, WE

04:32.796 --> 04:33.995
DUDE, WHAT ARE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

04:33.997 --> 04:35.696
WE ALWAYS JUST
PLAYED WITH FIREWORKS.

04:35.698 --> 04:37.031
I KNOW, LET'S
GO SLEDDING.

04:37.033 --> 04:38.499
YEAH.

04:38.501 --> 04:40.468
COME ON,
CARTMAN, GET ON.

04:40.470 --> 04:41.536
LET'S GO, DUDE,
WE'RE READY.

04:41.538 --> 04:42.770
WHAT THE HELL YOU

04:42.772 --> 04:45.373
GUYS, DON'T YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?

04:45.375 --> 04:48.376
YEAH, YOUR FAT ASS
ISN'T ON THE SLED.

04:48.378 --> 04:51.145
WHATEVER.

04:51.147 --> 04:53.781
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

04:53.783 --> 04:54.816
HEY,
THERE BOYS.

04:54.818 --> 04:55.616
HI, UNCLE JIMBO.

04:55.618 --> 04:57.318
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT
BLOWING THINGS UP?

04:57.320 --> 04:58.052
IT'S SUMMER.

04:58.054 --> 04:58.953
DIDN'T YOU HEAR?

04:58.955 --> 05:00.555
THEY OUTLAWED FIREWORKS BECAUSE
A LITTLE BOY BLEW OFF HIS HANDS.

05:00.557 --> 05:01.255
WHAT!

05:01.257 --> 05:03.157
YEAH, THEY'RE NOT EVEN HAVING
THEM AT THE LAKE THIS YEAR.

05:03.159 --> 05:04.592
OH, MY GOD.

05:04.594 --> 05:05.560
WELL, DON'T
WORRY, BOYS.

05:05.562 --> 05:07.895
UNCLE JIMBO
IS ON THE CASE.

05:07.897 --> 05:09.130
BUCKLE YOUR
SEATBELT, NED.

05:09.132 --> 05:10.932
WHERE ARE
WE GOING?

05:10.934 --> 05:12.099
MEXICO,
MY AMIGO.

05:12.101 --> 05:14.235
WHY ARE WE
GOING TO MEXICO?

05:14.237 --> 05:15.203
TO BUY
FIREWORKS.

05:15.205 --> 05:16.604
JUST CAUSE SOME KID BLEW
OFF HIS HANDS DOESN'T MEAN

05:16.606 --> 05:19.073
THE REST OF US HAVE TO
SUFFER, NOW DOES IT?

05:19.075 --> 05:21.242
ARE FIREWORKS
LEGAL IN MEXICO?

05:21.244 --> 05:23.277
HELL, EVERYTHING'S
LEGAL IN MEXICO.

05:23.279 --> 05:25.713
IT'S THE
AMERICAN WAY.

05:25.715 --> 05:27.982
AT THE DYNAMITE
FIREWORK COMPANY.

05:27.984 --> 05:29.917
WE HAVE A COMMITMENT
TO EXCELLENCE.

05:29.919 --> 05:31.686
OUR FOCUS IS
ON SAFETY WHILE--

05:31.688 --> 05:34.188
JUST CUT TO THE CHASE AND
TELL US ABOUT THE SNAKE.

05:34.190 --> 05:35.990
OKAY.

05:37.193 --> 05:40.261
NOW THE DISK THAT WE'RE
MAKING IS APPROXIMATELY

05:40.263 --> 05:43.798
FIVE THOUSAND TIMES BIGGER
THAN THE AVERAGE SNAKE.

05:43.800 --> 05:44.432
OOH.

05:44.434 --> 05:46.000
WE'LL HAVE TO FLY IT IN WITH
THREE KAMANCHI HELICOPTERS

05:46.002 --> 05:48.169
AND LOWER IT ON TO
THE GROUND AT THE LAKE.

05:48.171 --> 05:49.337
KAMANCHI
HELICOPTERS.

05:49.339 --> 05:53.507
THEN WE'LL NEED 57 FLAME
THROWERS ALL SET UP AROUND
THE PERIMETER OF THE DISK

05:53.509 --> 05:56.210
THAT ARE ALL TRIGGERED
TO FIRE AT THE SAME TIME.

05:56.212 --> 05:58.880
FLAME THROWERS,
TRIGGERED AT THE SAME TIME.

05:58.882 --> 06:01.349
ONCE LIT, THE
SNAKE WILL GROW.

06:01.351 --> 06:04.218
AND GOOD TIMES
WILL BE HAD BY ALL.

06:04.220 --> 06:05.319
WONDERFUL,
SPECTACULAR.

06:05.321 --> 06:08.356
WELL, YOU SEE FIREWORKS AT
THE LIKE WILL NOT ONLY GO ON,

06:08.358 --> 06:09.690
BUT PERHAPS BE
THE BEST EVER.

06:09.692 --> 06:10.524
WAIT A MINUTE,

06:10.526 --> 06:12.059
WE'RE GONNA NEED AN ORCHESTRA
TO PLAY THE STARS AND STRIPES.

06:12.061 --> 06:13.594
HEY, HOW ABOUT THE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ORCHESTRA?

06:13.596 --> 06:17.665
THEY DID A GREAT VERSION
OF MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB
AT THEIR LAST CONCERT.

06:17.667 --> 06:18.299
YES!

06:18.301 --> 06:19.400
GET THE SCHOOL
PRINCIPAL ON THE PHONE

06:19.402 --> 06:21.168
AND WE NEED SOMEBODY TO
DRESS UP LIKE UNCLE REMAS.

06:21.170 --> 06:22.970
MAYOR, I THINK
YOU MEAN UNCLE SAM.

06:22.972 --> 06:26.073
OF COURSE I DO,
YOU -- ASSHOLE.

06:28.478 --> 06:29.477
DUSTY THE
DIRT BALL.

06:29.479 --> 06:32.280
WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE
TO SUCK SO BAD IN SUMMER?

06:32.282 --> 06:33.781
HEY, LOOK IT'S
MR. GARRISON.

06:33.783 --> 06:34.649
HELLO,
CHILDREN.

06:34.651 --> 06:36.617
HOW IS YOUR
SUMMER GOING?

06:36.619 --> 06:37.852
SUMMER SUCKS ASS,
MR. GARRISON.

06:37.854 --> 06:39.487
HEY, HAVE YOU
FOUND MR. HAT YET?

06:39.489 --> 06:40.821
OH, OH,
THAT OLD THING.

06:40.823 --> 06:43.958
I ALMOST FORGOT
HE WAS GONE.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.526
I DON'T
NEED MR. HAT.

06:45.528 --> 06:47.128
THAT'S GOOD.

06:48.498 --> 06:50.765
MR. HAT IS
JUST A PUPPET.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.133
YUP.

06:54.103 --> 06:55.870
MR. HAT
ISN'T REAL.

06:55.872 --> 06:58.606
RIGHT.

06:58.608 --> 06:59.407
HEY,
YOU GUYS,

06:59.409 --> 07:01.809
MY MOM SIGNED ME UP FOR SWIMMING
LESSONS AT THE COMMUNITY POOL.

07:01.811 --> 07:02.810
YOU WANT
TO COME?

07:02.812 --> 07:03.544
( laughing )

07:03.546 --> 07:06.347
SWIMMING LESSONS? DUDE, THAT IS
THE LAMEST THING I EVER HEARD.

07:06.349 --> 07:07.081
IT IS NOT.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.517
EVERYONE KNOWS THE FIRST GRADERS
PEE IN THE COMMUNITY POOL.

07:09.519 --> 07:10.384
YEAH,
CARTMAN,

07:10.386 --> 07:11.886
YOU'RE SWIMMING AROUND
IN FIRST GRADER PEE.

07:11.888 --> 07:13.554
I'M NOT SWIMMING
AROUND IN PEE!

07:13.556 --> 07:14.455
WHATEVER,
DUDE.

07:14.457 --> 07:15.656
MY MOM SAYS IF I
TAKE SWIMMING LESSONS,

07:15.658 --> 07:16.991
I CAN BE IN THE
OLYMPICS SOME DAY.

07:16.993 --> 07:18.092
YEAH, THE
FAT ASS OLYMPICS.

07:18.094 --> 07:20.728
I'M TRYING TO MAKE THE
BEST OF A BAD SITUATION.

07:20.730 --> 07:21.829
I DON'T NEED
TO HEAR CRAP

07:21.831 --> 07:24.065
FROM A BUNCH OF HIPPY
FREAKS LIVING IN DENIAL!

07:24.067 --> 07:25.466
SCREW
YOU GUYS.

07:25.468 --> 07:27.268
I'M GOING HOME.

07:27.270 --> 07:28.336
BUT, CARTMAN,
WE'RE TRYING--

07:28.338 --> 07:31.038
NO, SCREW
YOU GUYS, HOME.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.306
WHAT DOES HE MEAN,
LIVING IN DENIAL?

07:32.308 --> 07:35.609
DUDE, IT'S CARTMAN, HE'S JUST
BEING A DUMB ASS LIKE ALWAYS.

07:35.611 --> 07:36.677
THERE, HOW
DOES THAT LOOK?

07:36.679 --> 07:39.080
LIKE A BIG HUNK OF DIRT WITH
A CARROT STICKING OUT OF IT.

07:39.082 --> 07:40.047
OH, CRAP.

07:43.152 --> 07:44.218
( whistle blowing )

07:44.220 --> 07:47.488
OKAY, KIDS,
EVERYONE IN THE POOL.

07:47.490 --> 07:49.890
COME ON, ERIC,
WE'RE GONNA START NOW.

07:49.892 --> 07:50.458
NAH!

07:50.460 --> 07:51.559
JUST JUMP IN.

07:51.561 --> 07:52.326
I DON'T WANT TO.

07:52.328 --> 07:55.196
IT'S NOT GONNA HURT
YOU, HON, JUST DO IT.

07:58.234 --> 07:59.133
THERE YOU GO.

07:59.135 --> 08:01.002
NOW JUST LET THE
FIRST GRADERS SWIM BY YOU,

08:01.004 --> 08:02.436
AND THEN HEAD
TOWARDS US.

08:02.438 --> 08:05.973
HUH,
FIRST GRADERS?

08:08.678 --> 08:15.649
THESE SONS
OF BITCHES!

08:15.651 --> 08:16.984
WHERE THE HELL
IS OUR FIREWORK?

08:16.986 --> 08:18.419
WE ONLY HAVE
TWENTY FOUR HOURS.

08:18.421 --> 08:19.820
I'M SURE IT WILL
BE HERE ANY SECOND.

08:19.822 --> 08:20.621
SHUT UP.

08:20.623 --> 08:22.056
COPY THAT.

08:22.058 --> 08:22.957
OKAY,
CHILDREN,

08:22.959 --> 08:24.692
I'M SURE WE'RE
A LITTLE RUSTY.

08:24.694 --> 08:25.760
WHERE'S
ERIC CARTMAN?

08:25.762 --> 08:27.094
HE'S TAKING
SWIMMING LESSONS.

08:27.096 --> 08:28.029
OH, DEAR.

08:28.031 --> 08:30.431
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
SOUND GOOD WITHOUT OUR
FRENCH HORN SECTION?

08:30.433 --> 08:32.033
OH, LET'S TRY
SOME SCALES FIRST.

08:32.035 --> 08:34.568
"C" SCALE
FIRST AND...

08:39.642 --> 08:40.975
OKAY, THAT WAS
PRETTY GOOD.

08:40.977 --> 08:43.978
LET'S PLAY MOZART
SYMPHONY NUMBER FIVE.

08:46.416 --> 08:47.281
OH, WE'RE DOOMED.

08:47.283 --> 08:49.183
OUR FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION
IS GONNA HAVE NO FIREWORKS

08:49.185 --> 08:51.752
AND A BUNCH OF TONE
DEAF LITTLE -- PLAYING.

08:51.754 --> 08:53.054
WAIT A MINUTE.

08:53.056 --> 08:55.623
IT'S THE SNAKE.

08:58.394 --> 08:59.560
LET'S MOVE
ALONG, PEOPLE.

08:59.562 --> 09:03.464
IF YOU SEEN ONE GIANT
SNAKE THINGY FIREWORK,
YOU'VE SEEN THEM ALL.

09:03.466 --> 09:05.499
CALL EVERYBODY,
THE SHOWS BACK ON.

09:05.501 --> 09:08.369
COME ON, WE'VE ONLY
GOT ONE DAY TO PREPARE!

09:10.606 --> 09:13.407
( speaking Spanish )

09:25.221 --> 09:26.320
WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THAT, NED?

09:26.322 --> 09:27.488
THAT'S A TIJUANA
BOTTLE ROCKET.

09:27.490 --> 09:31.492
THESE BABIES HAVE ENOUGH
POWER TO BLAST A FIRE HOLE
RIGHT THROUGH THE OZONE.

09:32.095 --> 09:33.060
THEY'RE
SPECTACULAR.

09:33.062 --> 09:35.796
NED, IT'S OUR JOB TO GET
THESE TO CHILDREN ALL OVER

09:35.798 --> 09:37.331

09:46.776 --> 09:49.076

Hello, is
Mr. Hat there?

09:49.078 --> 09:51.011
IS THIS SOME
KIND OF JOKE?

09:51.013 --> 09:51.979
Yes.

09:51.981 --> 09:52.913
YOU GO
TO HELL!

09:52.915 --> 09:54.048
YOU GO TO HELL
AND YOU DIE!

09:54.050 --> 09:56.083
I'M GONNA FIND
OUT WHO YOU ARE.

09:56.085 --> 09:58.486
I don't think
you can, okay.

09:58.488 --> 10:00.087
GODDAMNIT!

10:00.089 --> 10:03.124

YOU LIKE TO DO TODAY?

10:03.126 --> 10:05.659

10:33.656 --> 10:37.057
ERIC, YOU HAVE TO GET IN
THE DEEP END SOONER OR LATER.

10:37.059 --> 10:37.925
LATER'S FINE.

10:37.927 --> 10:39.727
JUST DO YOUR
SIDE STROKE.

10:39.729 --> 10:41.729
I ONLY KNOW HOW TO

OKAY.

10:49.272 --> 10:52.973
THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT,
YOU CAN DO IT.

10:52.975 --> 10:54.575
AH, DAMMIT!

10:54.577 --> 10:56.177
NOT AGAIN!

10:56.179 --> 10:56.911
COME ON, ERIC.

10:56.913 --> 10:59.079
NO WAY, YOU
SONS OF BITCHES!

10:59.081 --> 10:59.847
I'M GOING HOME.

10:59.849 --> 11:01.448
THE FOURTH OF JULY IS
FINALLY HERE WITH THE

11:01.450 --> 11:03.918
STATEWIDE BAN ON FIREWORKS
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER

11:03.920 --> 11:06.320
COLORADO ARE FLOCKING
TO SOUTH PARK.

11:06.322 --> 11:07.288
HERE WITH A
SPECIAL REPORT

11:07.290 --> 11:09.590
IS A NORMAL LOOKING
GUY WITH A FUNNY NAME.

11:09.592 --> 11:10.424
THANKS, TOM.

11:10.426 --> 11:11.792
IT LOOKS LIKE THE FIREWORK
BAND WON'T BE PUTTING A

11:11.794 --> 11:13.861
DAMPER ON ONE TOWN'S
FESTIVITIES TONIGHT.

11:13.863 --> 11:15.729
I'M HERE AT STARK'S POND IN
SOUTH PARK WHERE A CROWD OF

11:15.731 --> 11:18.899
RESIDENTS AND SCORES OF TOURISTS
ANXIOUSLY AWAIT THE LIGHTING OF

11:18.901 --> 11:21.468
THE LARGEST SNAKE
IN HUMAN HISTORY.

11:21.470 --> 11:22.937
NOW AS MOST OF YOU
WILL PROBABLY REMEMBER,

11:22.939 --> 11:25.773
SNAKES ARE THESE LITTLE
ROUND DISKS THAT YOU LIGHT

11:25.775 --> 11:28.209
AND THEY SPEW OUT A
LITTLE SNAKE OF BLACK ASH.

11:28.211 --> 11:31.845
WELL, THE SOUTH PARK SNAKE IS
OVER HALF A MILE IN DIAMETER

11:31.847 --> 11:33.113
AND TWENTY
STORIES HIGH.

11:33.115 --> 11:38.018
I'M TOLD THAT THIS EVENT WON'T
BEGIN UNTIL THE SUN GOES
DOWN AND NIGHT IS UPON US.

11:38.020 --> 11:40.187
ALRIGHTY THEN, LOOKS
LIKE WE'RE READY.

11:40.189 --> 11:42.189
HOW ARE YOUR SWIMMING
LESSONS GOING, CARTMAN?

11:42.191 --> 11:42.890
FINE.

11:42.892 --> 11:44.158
I HEARD YOU WON'T EVEN
GET IN THE DEEP END.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.292
WELL, YOU HEARD
WRONG, HIPPY!

11:45.294 --> 11:46.694
LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN,

11:46.696 --> 11:47.895
GOOD CITIZENS
OF COLORADO,

11:47.897 --> 11:50.564
IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE
THE FIRST PERSON TO WISH YOU
ALL A HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY!

11:50.566 --> 11:54.535
LET'S START WITH OUR SCHOOL BAND
PLAYING THE STARS AND STRIPES.

11:54.537 --> 11:55.502
THIS IS IT.

11:55.504 --> 11:59.039
AND A ONE AND
A TWO AND A...

12:01.244 --> 12:02.810
( together )
OH.

12:02.812 --> 12:03.911
WHAT THE --
IS THAT?

12:03.913 --> 12:05.613
I THINK IT'S THE
STARS AND STRIPES.

12:05.615 --> 12:07.514
OH, HELL,
LIGHT THE SNAKE.

12:07.516 --> 12:09.583
( applause )

12:16.125 --> 12:19.126
( together )
OOH.

12:19.128 --> 12:22.363
AHH.

12:24.934 --> 12:25.733
ALRIGHT,
NED,

12:25.735 --> 12:27.067
NOW WE'RE COMING UP
TO THE AMERICAN BORDER.

12:27.069 --> 12:29.470
THEY CAN'T KNOW THAT WE
HAVE FIREWORKS IN THE TRUNK.

12:29.472 --> 12:31.939
JUST LET ME
DO THE TALKING.

12:33.776 --> 12:37.478
I GUESS THAT GOES WITHOUT
SAYING, DOESN'T IT?

12:39.582 --> 12:40.914
GOOD EVENING,
GENTLEMEN.

12:40.916 --> 12:41.982
HELLO THERE,
FELLOW AMERICAN.

12:41.984 --> 12:43.984
WE'RE JUST ANXIOUS TO
GET BACK TO OUR HOMELAND.

12:43.986 --> 12:46.754
ALRIGHT, I JUST NEED TO
ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS.

12:46.756 --> 12:48.022
FIRE AWAY, WE HAVE
NOTHING TO HIDE.

12:48.024 --> 12:51.659
IS ANYONE OTHER THAN THE TWO OF
YOU TRAVELING IN THIS VEHICLE?

12:51.661 --> 12:52.359
NO, SIR.

12:52.361 --> 12:54.528
DO YOU HAVE ANY FIRE ARMS
OR EXPLOSIVES IN THE CAR?

12:54.530 --> 12:55.796
YEAH.

12:55.798 --> 12:56.897
I MEAN,
NO, NO.

12:56.899 --> 12:59.233
OPEN YOUR
TRUNK PLEASE, SIR.

12:59.235 --> 13:00.000
DAMN, DAMN!

13:00.002 --> 13:02.503
I ALWAYS GET THAT
QUESTION WRONG.

13:07.810 --> 13:08.909
MY GOD,
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

13:08.911 --> 13:12.579
IT NEVER FAILS TO AMAZE ME HOW
I MANAGE TO OVERCOME ADVERSITY.

13:14.517 --> 13:17.284
SAY, CHARLIE, WHEN
DOES THAT THING DIE OUT?

13:17.286 --> 13:18.052
DIE OUT?

13:18.054 --> 13:20.454
YES, YOU KNOW,
EXPIRE, END.

13:22.658 --> 13:25.392
HELLO, I'M ASKING
YOU WHEN IT STOPS!

13:25.394 --> 13:28.929
I'M NOT SURE, I NEVER
MADE ONE THIS BIG.

13:28.931 --> 13:31.699
I GUESS WE DIDN'T QUITE
THINK THIS THROUGH, DID WE?

13:31.701 --> 13:33.033
WHAT!

13:33.035 --> 13:34.401
DUDE, THAT
THING IS HUGE.

13:34.403 --> 13:35.636
YEAH, THEY NEED
TO SHUT IT OFF.

13:35.638 --> 13:38.605
HEY, YOU GUYS ARE
SCREWING UP THE SONG.

13:38.607 --> 13:39.873
SOMEBODY
STOP IT!

13:39.875 --> 13:40.908
IT'S OUT
OF CONTROL!

13:40.910 --> 13:43.911
( screaming )

13:46.148 --> 13:48.148
KENNY,
WATCH OUT!

13:49.418 --> 13:52.019
( mumbling )

13:52.021 --> 13:54.388
OH, MY GOD!
THEY KILLED KENNY.

13:54.390 --> 13:57.458
YOU BASTARDS!

13:57.460 --> 13:58.192
OH, MY GOD.

13:58.194 --> 14:00.694
YOU TELL ME HOW MUCH LONGER
THIS THING IS GONNA LAST!

14:00.696 --> 14:01.528
OH, LET'S SEE.

14:01.530 --> 14:03.497
A NORMAL SIZE SNAKE
LASTS THREE MINUTES.

14:03.499 --> 14:04.898
THIS IS...

14:04.900 --> 14:06.066
SO WHEN DOES
IT RUN OUT?

14:06.068 --> 14:08.268
NOVEMBER,
OF NEXT YEAR.

14:08.270 --> 14:09.103
OH, HELL.

14:09.105 --> 14:11.605
( screaming )

14:22.918 --> 14:24.318
WELL, WE'RE COMING
UP ON NINE HOURS

14:24.320 --> 14:27.955
AND THE GIANT SNAKE OF SOUTH
PARK SHOWS NO SIGNS OF STOPPING.

14:27.957 --> 14:30.257
RESIDENTS HAVE TRIED
EVERYTHING FROM FIRE HOSES

14:30.259 --> 14:32.960
TO YELLING AT IT TO
MAKE THE SNAKE STOP

14:32.962 --> 14:34.661
BUT NOTHING
SEEMS TO WORK.

14:34.663 --> 14:35.295
THANKS.

14:35.297 --> 14:37.531
POLICE ARE ADVISING ALL
CITIZENS TO STAY INDOORS,

14:37.533 --> 14:38.565
NOT BREATHE
THE ASH AND AIR,

14:38.567 --> 14:41.969
AND NOT EVER LIGHT ANY GIANT
SNAKES IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

14:41.971 --> 14:44.972
( screaming )

14:44.974 --> 14:45.839
MAN,
THIS SUCKS.

14:45.841 --> 14:46.974
WHAT SHOULD
WE DO, DUDE?

14:46.976 --> 14:48.075
THAT BIG SNAKE
KEEPS GROWING.

14:48.077 --> 14:49.276
IT'S GONNA DEMOLISH
THE WHOLE STATE SOON.

14:49.278 --> 14:50.511
WE SHOULD DO WHAT
WE ALWAYS DO,

14:50.513 --> 14:51.712
ASK CHEF

HOW'S THAT
GONNA HELP?

15:52.174 --> 15:53.073
ALL OVER
AMERICA,

15:53.075 --> 15:57.945
THE EFFECTS OF THE GIANT ASH
SNAKE OF SOUTH PARK CAN BE SEEN.

16:00.716 --> 16:04.885
LET THE SPIRIT OF HEAVENLY
FATHER BE BLESSED UPON YOU.

16:04.887 --> 16:08.021
FROM THIS DAY ON
ALL WILL BE WELL.

16:08.023 --> 16:12.860
I ALREADY FEEL LIKE
THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER.

16:14.697 --> 16:16.129
AND I CAN'T
SLEEP OR THINK.

16:16.131 --> 16:17.464
WHERE WOULD
HE HAVE GONE?

16:17.466 --> 16:18.799
WHY WOULD
HE LEAVE?

16:18.801 --> 16:19.933
WELL, LET ME
ASK YOU THIS?

16:19.935 --> 16:23.971
WHY...WHERE DO YOU
THINK MR. HAT WENT?

16:23.973 --> 16:25.472
HOW THE --
SHOULD I KNOW?

16:25.474 --> 16:26.306
IF I KNEW THAT,

16:26.308 --> 16:27.674
I WOULDN'T BE SEEING A --
PSYCHIATRIST, WOULD I?

16:27.676 --> 16:30.277
WELL, I GUESS I SEE WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, YEAH.

16:30.279 --> 16:31.912
AT FIRST I WAS SURE THAT
ONE OF THE CHILDREN TOOK HIM.

16:31.914 --> 16:36.250
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED
THAT MR. HAT AND I ACTUALLY
HAD A FIGHT THAT MORNING.

16:36.252 --> 16:38.685
UMM,

16:38.687 --> 16:39.920
ARE YOU GAY?

16:39.922 --> 16:40.621
WHAT!

16:40.623 --> 16:42.389
IT'S JUST, IT'S
JUST A QUESTION.

16:42.391 --> 16:44.024
ARE YOU
PROPOSITIONING ME?

16:44.026 --> 16:44.658
NO.

16:44.660 --> 16:47.294
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'M
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT NOT GAY.

16:47.296 --> 16:48.729
WELL, I
BELIEVE YOU.

16:48.731 --> 16:50.163
I ABSOLUTELY
BELIEVE YOU.

16:50.165 --> 16:51.832
MR. HAT,
ON THE OTHER HAND.

16:51.834 --> 16:52.833
MR. HAT
WAS GAY?

16:52.835 --> 16:56.403
SOMETIMES HE FANTASIZES
ABOUT SAME SEX RELATIONS.

16:56.405 --> 16:57.104
I SEE.

16:57.106 --> 16:59.573
SOMETIMES MR. HAT LIKED
TO PRETEND HE WAS IN A
SAUNA WITH BRETT FARVE

16:59.575 --> 17:01.675
AND A BOTTLE OF
THOUSAND ISLAND DRESSING.

17:01.677 --> 17:03.744
THAT I DID NOT
NEED TO KNOW.

17:03.746 --> 17:04.778
WELL, I'M
JUST SAYING.

17:04.780 --> 17:09.783
MR. GARRISON, I THINK THAT
MR. HAT WAS ACTUALLY YOUR
GAY SIDE TRYING TO COME OUT.

17:09.785 --> 17:10.684
YOU SEE.

17:10.686 --> 17:12.119
IT'S YOU
THAT'S GAY BUT

17:12.121 --> 17:13.120
BUT YOU'RE
IN DENIAL SO

17:13.122 --> 17:17.457
YOU ACT OUT YOUR GAY PERSONA
WITH A HOMOSEXUAL PUPPET.

17:18.961 --> 17:20.127
WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT THAT?

17:20.129 --> 17:23.964
I THINK YOU'RE THE
LOONY ONE IN THIS ROOM.

17:23.966 --> 17:26.366
( screaming )

17:26.635 --> 17:30.537
SERVES YOU RIGHT
YOU GAY BASHING HOMO.

17:31.240 --> 17:34.741
WELL, NED, LOOKS LIKE WE
MISSED FOURTH OF JULY AGAIN.

17:34.743 --> 17:36.476
YUP.

17:36.478 --> 17:37.144
DAMMIT!

17:37.146 --> 17:38.378
THOSE POOR KIDS MUST
HAVE BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED

17:38.380 --> 17:41.148
TO HAVE NOTHING BUT THOSE
STUPID WUSSY SNAKES TO LIGHT.

17:41.150 --> 17:43.216
WELL, BETTER
LUCK NEXT YEAR.

17:43.218 --> 17:44.785
YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:44.787 --> 17:45.852
OKAY, LET'S
TRY AGAIN.

17:45.854 --> 17:49.923
IS ANYONE OTHER THAN THE TWO OF
YOU TRAVELING IN THIS VEHICLE?

17:49.925 --> 17:50.657
NO.

17:50.659 --> 17:54.861
DO YOU HAVE ANY FIRE ARMS
OR EXPLOSIVES IN THE CAR?

17:54.863 --> 17:56.229
YES.

17:56.231 --> 17:58.031
DAMMIT, I GOT
IT WRONG AGAIN.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.434
WHAT'S THE
ANSWER AGAIN?

18:01.837 --> 18:02.669
HOLY SMOKES!

18:02.671 --> 18:03.937
WHAT THE
HELL IS THAT?

18:03.939 --> 18:05.706
IT LOOKS LIKE
MY EX WIFE.

18:05.708 --> 18:07.407
QUICK, NED, THIS
IS OUR CHANCE.

18:07.409 --> 18:08.642
THE HUMMER'S
OUTSIDE.

18:16.552 --> 18:19.553
HI, I HAVEN'T SEEN
YOU IN HERE BEFORE?

18:19.555 --> 18:22.856
AS MORE AND MORE CITIES ARE
EFFECTED BY THE GROWING ASH

18:22.858 --> 18:24.257
AND THE DEATH TOLL
RISES TO THREE THOUSAND,

18:24.259 --> 18:28.528
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY ARE LOOKING TO THE
MAYOR OF SOUTH PARK FOR ANSWERS.

18:28.530 --> 18:32.799
AND IT APPEARS AS IF THE MAJOR
IS GOING TO EXPLAIN MATTERS NOW.

18:32.801 --> 18:33.767
LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN,

18:33.769 --> 18:37.270
THE MAYOR OF SOUTH PARK REGRETS
THAT SHE CANNOT BE HERE HERSELF,

18:37.272 --> 18:39.539
BUT SHE
IS SICK.

18:40.009 --> 18:40.641
SURE.

18:40.643 --> 18:42.242
WHAT KIND OF LAME
EXCUSE IS THAT?

18:42.244 --> 18:43.644
YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

18:43.646 --> 18:45.312
ALL THIS IS
RIDICULOUS.

18:45.314 --> 18:46.880
COME ON,
WE WANT ANSWERS.

18:46.882 --> 18:49.983
SHE'S HAVING
HER PERIOD.

18:49.985 --> 18:50.617
OH.

18:50.619 --> 18:53.020
WE DO, HOWEVER, HAVE AN OFFICIAL
STATEMENT FOR ALL THE CONCERNED

18:53.022 --> 18:56.056
CITIES ABOUT THE MATTER
WITH THE GIANT SNAKE

18:56.058 --> 18:58.592
THAT WE CAN'T
SEEM TO PUT OUT.

18:58.594 --> 19:00.827
WE'RE SORRY,
OUR BAD.

19:00.829 --> 19:02.195
THANK YOU,
THAT IS ALL.

19:09.038 --> 19:09.936
OKAY.

19:09.938 --> 19:11.938
NO FIRST
GRADERS AROUND.

19:11.940 --> 19:15.542
I CAN SWIM TO
THE DEEP END.

19:15.544 --> 19:17.444
I CAN DO IT.

19:17.446 --> 19:18.578
I CAN DO IT.

19:18.580 --> 19:21.081
I CAN DO,
I'M GONNA MAKE IT.

19:24.687 --> 19:26.019
HOW MANY DAYS
LEFT IN SUMMER?

19:26.021 --> 19:26.820
A LOT,
I THINK.

19:26.822 --> 19:28.455
DAMMIT, I JUST WANT
IT TO SNOW AGAIN.

19:28.457 --> 19:29.690
I DON'T THINK
IT MATTERS, DUDE.

19:29.692 --> 19:32.492
THIS GIANT SNAKE IS
GONNA KILL EVERYONE SOON.

19:32.494 --> 19:33.794
BUENOS GRACIAS BOYS,

19:33.796 --> 19:34.761
HI
UNCLE JIMBO.

19:34.763 --> 19:36.963
OH, NOW WHY
THE LONG FACES?

19:36.965 --> 19:37.931
WE'RE BORED.

19:37.933 --> 19:38.999
THERE'S
NOTHING TO DO.

19:39.001 --> 19:43.003
WELL, I DON'T THINK THOSE ARE
PROBLEMS THAT SOME TIJUANA
BOTTLE ROCKETS CAN'T SOLVE.

19:43.005 --> 19:44.604
( together )
HOORAY.

19:44.606 --> 19:47.307
CAREFUL WITH THOSE NOW,
THOSE ARE DANGEROUS.

19:50.345 --> 19:52.345
POINT THEM AWAY
FROM YOUR EYES NOW.

19:52.347 --> 19:54.147
WOW, THESE
ARE HUGE.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.082
OH, LOOK
AT THEM, NED.

19:55.084 --> 19:59.252
LOOK HOW MUCH HAPPINESS A LITTLE
FIRE POWER CAN BRING TO A CHILD.

20:04.493 --> 20:07.294
HEY, LOOK, WE
BLEW UP THE SNAKE.

20:07.296 --> 20:10.864
ALL THE ASH FROM THE SNAKE
IS PUTTING THE FLAME OUT.

20:10.866 --> 20:12.232
WELL, HOW DO
YOU LIKE THAT?

20:12.234 --> 20:14.935
BOTTLE ROCKETS SAVED
THE FOURTH OF JULY.

20:14.937 --> 20:17.237
( together )
HOORAY.

20:18.974 --> 20:20.006
I'M GONNA
MAKE IT.

20:20.008 --> 20:22.342
I'M GONNA MAKE IT
TO THE DEEP END.

20:22.344 --> 20:23.410
I DID IT!

20:23.412 --> 20:24.211
I DID IT!

20:24.213 --> 20:26.012
I MADE IT TO
THE DEEP END!

20:26.014 --> 20:27.347
HOORAY FOR ME!

20:27.349 --> 20:29.249
( female )
THE SNAKES
BEEN DESTROYED.

20:29.251 --> 20:30.951
THE POOL'S OPEN!

20:30.953 --> 20:31.651
HUH?

20:31.653 --> 20:33.653
( whistle blowing )

20:36.325 --> 20:38.592
YOU SONS
OF BITCHES!

20:38.594 --> 20:41.228
SONS
OF BITCHES!

20:41.230 --> 20:45.398
LOOK, THEY PUT
OUT THE SNAKE.

20:45.400 --> 20:50.170
YES, APPARENTLY MY PLAN TO BLOW
UP THE SNAKE WORKED PERFECTLY.

20:50.172 --> 20:52.372
HEY, LOOK
IT'S SNOWING.

20:52.374 --> 20:55.475
WELL, IT'S SNOWING BLACK
ASH BUT WHAT THE HELL.

20:55.477 --> 20:56.910
( laughing )

21:01.350 --> 21:02.249
WINTER'S BACK.

21:02.251 --> 21:04.117
WOW, IT'S A
BLACK BLIZZARD.

21:04.119 --> 21:05.719
MR. GARRISON,
WHERE'S MR. HAT?

21:05.721 --> 21:07.788
OH, I'M THROUGH

21:07.790 --> 21:09.489

TIMING WHORE.

21:09.491 --> 21:10.524

21:10.526 --> 21:13.527

LEARNING FROM MR. TWIG.

21:13.529 --> 21:14.694
THAT'S RIGHT,
CHILDREN.

21:14.696 --> 21:16.062
I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE FALL.

21:16.064 --> 21:22.135
WELL, I CAN
HARDLY WAIT.

21:22.137 --> 21:23.804
HEY, CHILDREN,
