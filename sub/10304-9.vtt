01:15.520 --> 01:18.193
Look, J.B.
You see, l'm a reasonable man.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.795
See, if you
don't give my client this audition...

01:29.000 --> 01:31.753
...l'm gonna have to have 1 00 roses
delivered to your wife...

01:31.960 --> 01:33.678
...in your girlfriend's name.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.994
Thanks, babe.
l knew you'd see my way.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.714
Hey. What is it?
Did you get me an audition?

01:41.440 --> 01:42.793
You?

01:44.440 --> 01:48.797
No, no, no, no.
l've discovered a major new talent.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.075
l'll give you a hint.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.874
He just peed on the D'Arcys' roses.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.393
Dad?

01:58.960 --> 02:00.279
No.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.754
Lucky.

02:01.960 --> 02:07.557
Yeah, but isn't it unprofessional
for agents to date their clients?

02:09.720 --> 02:13.235
That's very funny,
Million Man March.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.031
lt's a dog food commercial.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.754
Now, all Lucky has to do
is learn a few simple tricks...

02:20.960 --> 02:23.076
...and pretend to like the stuff.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.469
No problem.
I lick your face and pretend to lik e you.

02:38.640 --> 02:42.792
Gee, Al, l've never heard of
a three-day funeral.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.673
Per chance you don't remember
our honeymoon?

02:46.800 --> 02:50.076
Yes. Something certainly died
back then.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.317
Unfortunately, it never got buried.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.997
l just want you
to look me in the face...

02:56.200 --> 02:59.237
...and tell me
that you are not going fishing.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.953
Peg, l lie about a lot of things.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.152
Who l'm married to, who my kids are.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.155
What that smell was.

03:11.520 --> 03:16.036
But l would never ever lie
about Aunt Betty's funeral.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.470
l thought you said it was Aunt Nell.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.148
lt's a double funeral, Peg.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.997
Which is why it's gonna take
three days or four if they're biting--

03:25.200 --> 03:28.795
l mean crying.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.956
Okay, Al...

03:36.120 --> 03:37.519
...you ready to go fishing?

03:37.720 --> 03:39.995
What Jefferson means, Peg,
is that the family said:

03:40.200 --> 03:45.115
'' ln lieu of bringing flowers
we should all bring fish.''

03:45.840 --> 03:47.990
Let's go, Jefferson. No. No, Al.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.919
No, my days as a cad
and a bounder are over.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.918
l feel very strongly that you
should never lie to your wife...

03:54.120 --> 03:56.714
...and for one very good reason.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.635
And what was it again, Marcie?

03:59.840 --> 04:02.070
A lie may give you
temporary pleasure...

04:02.280 --> 04:05.158
...but honesty will bring you
happiness at the end of the day.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.636
And l was so happy that Jefferson
told me the truth about his trip...

04:08.840 --> 04:11.991
...that l've given him
something very special.

04:12.200 --> 04:16.113
Nobody wants to hear
about your filthy chicken love.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.677
No, Al. Marcie gave me
this new telephoto lens for my camera.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.233
Look. Trust me, Al.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.557
l know honesty goes against
everything we guys stand for...

04:26.760 --> 04:29.957
...but women eat it up.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.596
All right. l'll give it a shot.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.598
Peg, l'm going to be honest with you.
l'm going fishing this weekend.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.997
And every Saturday
when l take the garbage out...

04:44.480 --> 04:47.040
...l throw away one of your shoes.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.193
Well, you know, Al,
l'm gonna be honest with you too.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.834
l knew you were going fishing.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.235
And at night when you're sleeping...

04:56.440 --> 04:59.671
...l pluck out your hairs
so you'll bald faster.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.835
Oh, God, l love this place, Al.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.713
lt was a stroke of genius
having me cash in Marcie's lRA...

05:20.920 --> 05:23.434
...to pay for this luxury vacation.

05:24.160 --> 05:27.869
Jefferson, would you stop taking
pictures so we can enjoy this place.

05:35.360 --> 05:39.478
Jefferson, would you start taking
pictures so we can enjoy this place.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.356
We're your Swedish masseuses.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.676
-l'm Helga.
-And l'm lnga.

05:45.880 --> 05:48.348
And l'm Alga.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.390
And l'm gaga.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.998
-May we carry your bags?
-Yes.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.953
May we carry yours?

06:00.480 --> 06:01.754
Yeah, sure.

06:02.720 --> 06:07.748
Jefferson, we died and went
to the land of milk and honeys.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.634
Mr. Bundy and Mr. D'Arcy.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.991
l'm Randolph the innkeeper, and
l've been trying to get ahold of you.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.919
There's been a slight change
in your cabin assignment.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.269
What's the change?

06:20.480 --> 06:22.311
You don't have one.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.515
That's okay,
we'll bunk in with Helga and lnga.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.109
Yeah, sure.

06:31.080 --> 06:34.436
Helga, lnga, you're late
for topless happy hour.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.756
Yeah, sure.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.672
Hey, look. You can't bump us.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.314
See, we made our reservation
over a year ago.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.988
Oh, so you did.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.237
Let me explain something.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.876
You're nobodies
and you had a reservation.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.640
Shannon Tweed is a famous actress.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.673
She didn't have a reservation.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.029
Explanation over.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.713
Shannon Tweed?

07:05.920 --> 07:07.797
Star of Night Eyes II,
Night Eyes Three...

07:08.000 --> 07:11.231
...and every fantasy l've ever had
since l got cable?

07:12.520 --> 07:15.512
You know, Shannon Tweed got me
through many a long lonely night...

07:15.720 --> 07:17.711
...of sex with Marcie.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.590
Oh, Randolph?

07:21.920 --> 07:23.478
Yes, Ms. Tweed.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.831
Are those the two gentlemen
that had reservations for my cabin?

07:27.040 --> 07:28.917
-Yes, Ms. Tweed.
-Oh, good.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.236
l did so want to meet them.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.671
l told you
she'd straighten this thing out...

07:35.880 --> 07:39.270
...just like she straightened out
Andrew Stevens in Night Eyes Three.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.389
Yeah. Well, just as l thought.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.874
A mangy shoe salesman...

07:44.080 --> 07:47.231
...and a chronically unemployed
aging pretty boy.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.432
Have them thrown off
the property immediately.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.833
Jeez, l can't believe she said that.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.918
Me either. Aging?

07:59.800 --> 08:01.552
Now, Redford, that's aging.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.637
Now, gentlemen.

08:03.840 --> 08:07.150
Just to show you
l'm not entirely without feeling...

08:07.360 --> 08:08.588
...here's your deposit back.

08:08.800 --> 08:12.759
Oh, and here are
your complementary mints.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.236
l suggest Mr. Bundy have them both.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.390
And you have exactly two minutes
to get off the premises.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.192
Good day.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.911
Well, who the hell
does he think he is?

08:29.120 --> 08:30.792
He can't throw us out of here.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.275
Well, l'm afraid he can, Al.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.437
Private property.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.631
l'll show him some private property.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.755
Lucky...

08:55.960 --> 08:59.350
...if you're gonna be in this commercial
you're gonna have to learn to sit.

08:59.560 --> 09:00.879
Now, sit.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.550
l'll never teach this dog how to sit.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.110
What am l gonna have to do? Beg?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.233
Hey.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.720
Kelly, l cannot get this dog
to do what l want him to do.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.195
Well, maybe you need a rubber dog.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.714
Here, let me try.
l'll show him by example.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.638
All right, Lucky, sit.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.717
Kelly, please.
That's never going to work.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.990
l've already tried doing all that--

09:39.880 --> 09:43.031
Come on, Lucky. Let's go outside
and l'll teach you some more tricks.

09:43.240 --> 09:46.073
Give me a bone with some meat on it,
I'll jump over the house.

09:51.720 --> 09:55.030
So getting bumped from the fishing
cabin wasn't all that bad, was it, Al?

09:55.240 --> 09:57.470
Well, nothing drowns
your sorrows better...

09:57.680 --> 10:00.877
...than a three-day binge
at the nudie bar.

10:03.640 --> 10:07.235
Wow, look at this picture
l took of the lake.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.279
Here's the lodge.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.789
Here's a nudie bar.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.677
Wait a second, Jefferson. We didn't
take any pictures of the nudie bar.

10:16.360 --> 10:19.557
Hey, you're right.
And the nudie bar isn't in the woods...

10:19.760 --> 10:24.311
...and it doesn't have Shannon Tweed
and Randolph in the hot tub.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.875
Holy Moses, Jefferson.
Do you know what this means?

10:29.080 --> 10:32.038
Yeah. Cosby's right.
Kodak paper does make a difference.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.670
Not that, you idiot.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.110
lt's payback time.

10:37.320 --> 10:40.392
Nobody bumps us, baby.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.435
Shannon Tweed is about
to get bumped herself...

10:46.640 --> 10:50.713
...right on to the front page
of the National Enquirer.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.952
Yes.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.351
Boy, look at this picture
of Shannon Tweed.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.154
Jefferson, isn't she a babe?

11:00.360 --> 11:02.351
Oh, come on, Al.

11:02.560 --> 11:06.348
l'll bet our wives,
in this beautiful mountain setting...

11:06.560 --> 11:11.873
...with the steam rising up off
the hot tub would look just as good.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.354
No way.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.197
No way.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.194
Jefferson...

11:21.400 --> 11:24.437
...how much do you think this picture
of Shannon Tweed is worth...

11:24.640 --> 11:26.153
...to the tabloids?

11:26.360 --> 11:27.998
Well, let's see.

11:28.200 --> 11:32.830
Your typical celebrity nude photo
brings in, oh, say, upwards of $1 000.

11:33.040 --> 11:38.876
But, see, in this case it's a celebrity
doing the humpty dance with the help.

11:39.080 --> 11:42.117
That's gotta fetch at least $1 0,000.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.076
You see, but Jefferson, even though
we did get bumped from our cabin...

11:51.280 --> 11:54.875
...but l mean, this is a little
heartless and cold even for us.

11:55.360 --> 11:58.193
Yeah. Yeah, you're right, Al.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.756
You know, the honest thing to do
would be just throw this away...

12:01.960 --> 12:03.678
...and pretend like it never happened.

12:03.880 --> 12:06.872
-You got it.
-All right. Just--

12:09.840 --> 12:12.195
Well, you feel better
about yourself now?

12:12.400 --> 12:13.833
Much.

12:14.040 --> 12:17.794
l'll see you later, buddy. You know,
l think since Peg's not home--

12:18.000 --> 12:21.117
Peg's not home it's probably safe
to go up and take a little nap.

12:21.320 --> 12:27.475
Well, Marcie is home so l think
l'll go back to the nudie bar.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.353
-Later, buddy.
-Back at you, pal of mine.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.316
-You the man.
-Oh, no.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.072
No, no. You the man.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.113
Next.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.788
How dare you reject my dog!

13:01.000 --> 13:04.549
He's Eddie on Frasier, you know?

13:04.760 --> 13:06.955
Ma'am, Eddie is
a Jack Russell Terrier.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.958
You're mutt is a near-blind bulldog.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.717
Well, he looks different in person.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.911
You're in the business.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.475
You know
the camera adds 1 5 pounds.

13:17.680 --> 13:21.229
And so will those donuts you stuffed
in your purse during the audition.

13:21.440 --> 13:22.714
Now, get out.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.430
Let's go, Eddie.

13:25.640 --> 13:28.791
Jeez, you'd think there'd be
one half-starved mongrel in this town...

13:29.000 --> 13:31.355
...who could make it through
this obstacle course.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.675
Lucky can do it.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.111
Oh, yeah? l suppose he plays Murray
on Mad About You?

13:37.200 --> 13:39.350
Oh, no. He hates Paul Reiser.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.596
ln that case l'll give him a shot.

13:41.800 --> 13:47.158
Hungry Puppy dog food audition
number 207 3, take one.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.070
Now, run the course.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.719
Come on, Lucky.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.638
Just get into character.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.434
Be a hungry puppy.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.676
Oh, there's a stretch.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.708
Come on, Lucky.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.718
Don't you want to be in the commercial
and make lots of money?

14:05.920 --> 14:09.356
Oh, I know how this works. I get
in the commercial, you get the money...

14:09.560 --> 14:13.314
...I end up sharing a jail cell
with the cast of Diff'rent Strokes.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.999
-Next.
-No, wait, wait.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.317
He can do it, l promise.
He just needs a little motivation.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.556
Just watch and follow me.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.878
Come on.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.719
l love hungry puppy. Come on, say it.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.595
Well, that was great.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.028
The auditions are over.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.515
We have our hungry puppy.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.832
Thank you. There you go.
Have a seat.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.951
Thanks very much.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.038
Attention, media whores--

15:01.720 --> 15:03.870
l mean esteemed members
of the press.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.311
The auction for the Shannon Tweed
hot tub photo is about to begin.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.988
-Show us the goods then.
-Show us the stuff first.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.998
All right, all right. All in good time.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.077
Before l get
to the main event however...

15:15.280 --> 15:20.195
...l would like to start with a genuine
picture of the Loch Ness monster.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.755
-Let's see. Come on, show us.
-You gotta be kidding.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.155
My God, Al, that's horrific.
What the hell is it?

15:25.360 --> 15:28.033
lt's a picture of Peg's mom
in the bathtub.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.916
l don't see a bathtub in there.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.554
Trust me, Jefferson,
it's under there somewhere.

15:35.880 --> 15:39.873
That's not the Loch Ness monster.
He's not that big.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.432
So what? We'll slap Roseanne's head
on it and say she lost weight.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.279
-l'll give you 50 bucks.
-Sold.

15:46.480 --> 15:50.268
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
the main event.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.995
Shannon Tweed as you
have never seen her before.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.715
-Now, we will start the bidding at--
-One thousand dollars.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.114
l got a $1 000 here.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.311
-Do l hear more?
-Three thousand.

16:01.520 --> 16:05.229
Oh, come on. You pay twice that much
for Brett Butler pulling out her wedgie.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.351
Come on.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.915
-l'll give you 5000.
-Make it 1 0.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.953
Ten thousand dollars here.
We have $1 0,000 going once...

16:13.160 --> 16:14.639
...1 0,000 going twice...

16:14.840 --> 16:18.833
...so close to a sale.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.234
Make it 1 2.5.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.829
Jefferson, keep the fleecing going.
lf l'm not back...

16:23.040 --> 16:27.636
...you send my mail to King Al,
hammock one, lsle of Yap.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.714
Okay, 1 2.5, right?

16:35.960 --> 16:38.997
Shannon Tweed here in my house?

16:39.200 --> 16:43.239
Mr. Bundy, l know you're gonna
find this hard to believe...

16:43.440 --> 16:47.877
...but l came by to apologize
for the way l treated you at the lodge.

16:48.600 --> 16:52.229
Well, l-- Apology accepted.
l gotta go now. Bye.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.556
Oh, no. Mr. Bundy, wait.

16:54.960 --> 16:58.191
Look. You know,
being a famous actress...

16:58.400 --> 17:01.995
...l guess l've gotten used
to having my own way...

17:02.200 --> 17:05.988
...and, well, l might have forgotten
that other people have feelings too.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.032
But without those people
l'm not a famous star.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.357
l'm just an average woman.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.916
With way-above-average hooters.

17:20.240 --> 17:24.118
Well, thank you.
God and Dr. Markowitz have been kind.

17:25.160 --> 17:28.869
Anyway, l felt so bad
after l got home, that l--

17:29.080 --> 17:32.709
l talked it over with my shrink,
my herbalist...

17:32.920 --> 17:36.833
...the counter boy at Starbucks,
and they all agreed.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.634
''Shannon, you're a taker,'' they said.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.831
''You've got to start giving.''

17:42.040 --> 17:45.271
Well, you were giving pretty good
in that shower scene...

17:45.480 --> 17:47.789
...in Indecent Behavior.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.116
Well, thank you but that was acting.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.719
This is real.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.309
lf l only knew
that l've reached you in some way...

17:56.520 --> 17:58.954
...l'd feel so much better
about myself.

17:59.880 --> 18:03.031
Oh, you've reached me.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.037
Oh, God, you're so sexy.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.754
-lf you weren't married--
-Oh, l'm not married.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.509
No, l live alone with
my redheaded mother.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.997
What am l talking about?

18:19.200 --> 18:23.352
There l go, selfishly giving in
to my insatiable lust for you.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.313
lnsatiable lust?

18:26.960 --> 18:29.758
-For me?
-Oh, yeah.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.555
Well, that's understandable. You know,
l played a little high school ball.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.989
lt really shows.

18:37.480 --> 18:38.515
Shannon...

18:38.720 --> 18:41.757
...you may not understand
what l'm about to do...

18:41.960 --> 18:47.751
...but always remember
that l do this for you.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.034
Al, what are you doing
with that envelope?

18:57.520 --> 18:59.158
Did you swallow that whole thing?

18:59.360 --> 19:00.873
Yep.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.875
lt looked like
there was a photograph in it.

19:04.480 --> 19:05.879
Yeah.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.033
Of me in a hot tub?

19:12.480 --> 19:14.471
Yeah.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.677
You blue-collared...

19:19.880 --> 19:23.714
...brown-panted, shoe-selling yokel.

19:23.920 --> 19:28.311
Despite what Siskel and Ebert say
l am quite an accomplished actress...

19:28.520 --> 19:31.318
...as you've so clearly
demonstrated today.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.875
So the next time
you want to see me in a hot tub...

19:34.080 --> 19:36.435
...you rent my upcoming
straight-to-video classic...

19:36.640 --> 19:38.870
...Ernest Pays for Sex.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.116
And don't forget to rewind.

19:54.240 --> 19:58.552
Al. Al, l got them up to 25,000.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.911
Now, l think we should make
like Waterworld and close immediately.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.591
l'm choking.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.199
Well, why are you joking?

20:07.400 --> 20:10.278
-l said l'm choking.
-Oh, you're choking.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.755
Okay, let me help you out.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.955
There. Did you swallow
what was stuck in your throat?

20:19.160 --> 20:21.754
-Yes, Jefferson. l did.
-Good, you're not choking anymore.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.679
No, no. But you are.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.638
Come on.

20:33.520 --> 20:34.873
So how was the hospital?

20:35.080 --> 20:36.752
Any luck getting the negative out?

20:36.960 --> 20:40.430
No, Al's stomach acid dissolved it.

20:41.080 --> 20:44.277
But they did find three quarters
of a commemorative Slim Jim...

20:44.480 --> 20:47.233
...leftover from Super Bowl Xll.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.399
That's what l've been tasting
all these years.

20:50.600 --> 20:54.878
Well, despite losing the 25,000 and
the cost for the visit to the hospital...

20:55.080 --> 20:56.638
...and the vintage Slim Jim....

20:56.840 --> 20:58.910
On the bright side is
whenever you're down...

20:59.120 --> 21:02.112
...there's always TV
to pick you back up.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.715
Hey, everybody. Listen.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.195
The Hungry Puppy commercial
is gonna come on.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.879
Is your puppy hungry?

21:09.080 --> 21:11.389
Then get him
Hungry Puppy dog food.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.319
The only food that puppies prefer
to their own tails.

21:16.800 --> 21:20.395
If doggy's nose is dry
And his tongue is black

21:20.600 --> 21:24.115
And his ribs are showing
Through his back

21:24.320 --> 21:28.029
Give him Hungry Puppy
A bite or two

21:28.240 --> 21:31.676
And your starving mutt
Will be good as new

21:31.880 --> 21:35.634
Give him Hungry Puppy
A bite or two

21:35.840 --> 21:40.391
And your starving mutt
Will be good as new

21:43.520 --> 21:45.238
l mean:

21:45.440 --> 21:47.749
l love Puppy Hungry.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.349
That's '' Hungry Puppy.''

21:50.560 --> 21:53.154
Yeah, what he said.

21:55.680 --> 21:59.116
Hungry Puppy
Hungry Puppy

21:59.320 --> 22:01.675
Hungry Puppy

22:02.305 --> 22:08.703
