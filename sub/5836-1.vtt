INGLEWOOD,
CALIFORNIA, 1979

02:01.079 --> 02:03.207
<i>I always loved airplanes, man.</i>

02:03.248 --> 02:06.168
<i>Not just toys,
but real ones, too.</i>

02:07.044 --> 02:09.253
<i>We lived
right next to the airport.</i>

02:09.295 --> 02:11.256
<i>I remember my mom
would put my stroller outside</i>

02:11.340 --> 02:12.841
<i>while she hung clothes
on the line.</i>

02:26.563 --> 02:28.482
<i>My mom always told me
that someday,</i>

02:28.565 --> 02:30.567
<i>it would be me gettin' on
one of those planes</i>

02:30.609 --> 02:32.027
<i>goin' someplace better.</i>

02:32.110 --> 02:34.780
<i>But I guess it didn't exactly
work out that way.</i>

02:35.113 --> 02:36.448
<i>Final boarding announcement</i>

02:36.490 --> 02:38.575
<i>for Worldwide Airlines
Flight 119.</i>

02:50.170 --> 02:51.129
I'm sorry, sir.

02:51.255 --> 02:53.507
Your dog is too big
to be on the plane.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.591
You'll have to check him.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.511
Wait. No. I usually
just put him in my bag.

02:57.594 --> 02:58.720
He's not that big.

02:58.804 --> 03:01.974
Those are the rules.
You'll have to check your dog.

03:02.057 --> 03:05.018
Or consider taking
another airline.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.645
Come on, man.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.980
- Can I just please--
- Russ.

03:10.399 --> 03:11.525
I can't just...

03:14.069 --> 03:16.154
Come on, Dre.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.739
- Come on.
- Don't worry, sir.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.950
- We'll take good care of him.
- Please do.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.660
That's my little boy right there.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.078
See you when I get off.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.913
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Enjoy your flight.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.132
<i>Our in-flight movie will be
Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,</i>

03:35.174 --> 03:37.509
<i>starring Sandra Bullock
and Ashley Judd.</i>

03:37.593 --> 03:38.802
Nice.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.098
That's the sound of my gat

03:46.810 --> 03:50.063
This is heat.
This album is fire.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.027
Chicken or beef stroganoff?

03:55.152 --> 03:56.486
Chicken, I'll have the chicken.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.116
Thank you.
Excuse me.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.702
- It smells good, though.
- Chicken or beef stroganoff?

04:03.785 --> 04:06.079
I'm gonna have the chicken.
I like the way that smelled.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.248
That was our last chicken.

04:08.332 --> 04:09.708
I'm afraid
I just have stroganoff.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.835
So why would you ask me
what I wanted?

04:15.506 --> 04:16.632
What's in that?

04:16.714 --> 04:18.091
Stroganoff.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.311
That beef strogie.
That wasn't half bad.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.021
It was good.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.357
Almost got a little spit on you.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.816
- Yes, you did.
- I'm sorry.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.744
Are you all right, sir?

04:46.912 --> 04:47.913
Where the bathroom?

04:47.996 --> 04:49.498
- Straight down.
- Where?

04:50.582 --> 04:51.917
Fire in the hole.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.711
Excuse me.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.505
So sorry.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.929
Come on! Hurry.
Get in there!

05:04.012 --> 05:07.099
Damn! Oh, shit!

05:10.269 --> 05:11.228
So loose.

05:12.688 --> 05:16.692
I got it. That's it.
No, it's not.

05:18.861 --> 05:21.071
<i>This is the captain speaking.
We hit some turbulence.</i>

05:21.113 --> 05:23.323
<i>We ask that you
return to your seats.</i>

05:23.407 --> 05:25.284
<i>We've turned on
the "fasten seatbelt" sign.</i>

05:25.325 --> 05:27.202
I didn't know
it was gonna be like that.

05:37.629 --> 05:41.425
I can't get out!
My ass is stuck!

05:43.594 --> 05:46.263
Come on. God, please,
I'm a Christian.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.223
My ass is touchin' the shit.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.023
I don't wanna die like this!
Stewardess!

05:56.481 --> 05:59.026
There's a guy locked in
the bathroom stuck on the toilet.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.987
Press the main release discharge valve--
that should get him loose.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.657
Oh, shit.

06:16.960 --> 06:17.961
What the fuck?!

06:22.216 --> 06:26.512
Dre! No!

06:29.014 --> 06:33.185
Murderers!

06:33.268 --> 06:36.647
You killed my dog, man.
Y'all gonna pay for this!

06:36.688 --> 06:38.690
If I have to go on
every talk show in America,

06:38.732 --> 06:40.275
y'all gonna pay!

06:40.359 --> 06:45.030
Oprah, Ricki Lake,
Dr, Phil bitch!

06:45.155 --> 06:49.868
<i>106th and Park.
Showtime At The Apollo.</i>

06:49.952 --> 06:52.996
I swear,
they're gonna pay for this.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.624
You don't treat people
like this.

06:57.960 --> 07:01.088
And that's what happened.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.633
What exactly
is your occupation, Nashawn?

07:06.051 --> 07:09.388
- I'm an entrepreneur.
- I see.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.515
So I guess it's fair to say
you don't have a job.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.392
No, I do--

07:13.475 --> 07:15.978
Tell us about
some of your businesses.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.230
Any of 'em
ever make any money?

07:21.108 --> 07:23.068
- No.
- Exactly.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.529
So it would be correct to say
that you're nothin' more

07:25.571 --> 07:28.198
than a deadbeat
lookin' for a quick dollar. Right?

07:28.282 --> 07:29.491
No further questions.

07:29.575 --> 07:30.784
Wait! That's not fair.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.160
Order!

07:35.831 --> 07:38.000
Your Honor,
can I say something, please?

07:38.083 --> 07:39.668
Be brief.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.633
I watched my mom
struggle to raise me

07:46.717 --> 07:50.345
on next to nothin',
workin' for guys like you.

07:52.598 --> 07:56.059
And I always knew that
I had to make my own way,

07:56.185 --> 07:57.144
no matter what.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.105
I might not have
some fancy education

08:00.189 --> 08:04.443
or a Fortune 500
business, but...

08:05.986 --> 08:07.404
...I'm tryin'.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.617
My mom always told me

08:11.658 --> 08:14.703
that you can't be successful
until you try.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.790
That's all I'm doin'.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.753
Thank you, Your Honor.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.634
Will the foreman
please read the verdict?

08:35.265 --> 08:38.184
Case number 077861.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.188
<i>Nashawn Wade
vs. Worldwide Airlines,</i>

08:41.270 --> 08:44.900
we find for the plaintiff
and award him damages

08:44.983 --> 08:47.653
in the amount of $100 million.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.449
Order! Order!

08:53.450 --> 08:54.701
Yo, cousin!

08:54.785 --> 08:57.329
We did it, man!
We did it! Yes!

08:57.454 --> 08:58.455
What do you mean, "we"?

08:58.539 --> 09:01.124
I didn't see your ass get stuck
in no airplane toilet.

09:01.208 --> 09:06.672
Whatever, I say we blow the first
20 mil on Rio, next 20 mil, Bangkok.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.215
I hear they can do this thing--

09:08.298 --> 09:11.301
Muggs, you're my cousin.
I'm not gonna forget about you,

09:11.343 --> 09:13.679
or the way you looked out for me
when we was growin' up.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.723
I'm not gonna let you convince me
I'm fuckin' this money away.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.809
You still on that
strip club/daycare center thing?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.853
Shit was genius. Come on.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.355
It was genius, Muggsy?
To who?

09:23.397 --> 09:25.399
We lost all our damn money
in a week.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.110
We gonna do it straight
this time, all right?

09:28.193 --> 09:29.987
I wanna do something
I can be proud of.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.448
Whatever it is, I'm in.

09:33.532 --> 09:36.285
There he is, Mr. Wade?

09:36.368 --> 09:38.996
How does it feel to be
the recipient of such a large reward

09:39.037 --> 09:40.247
by the court?

09:40.330 --> 09:42.708
I mean, it feels good, ya know?
Justice has been served.

09:42.791 --> 09:43.792
But I tell you what,

09:43.876 --> 09:46.420
I'd trade all that money in
to get back my dog Dre.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.672
Nashawn, how's the ass?

09:50.424 --> 09:53.010
The ass is fine,
It is sittin' on $100 million,

09:55.012 --> 09:57.014
Mr, Wade, can you tell us
what you intend to do

09:57.097 --> 09:58.182
with all that money?

10:06.231 --> 10:08.567
I'm gonna start my own airline.
No further questions.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.110
Muggs, take care of that, please.

10:10.194 --> 10:11.987
What is this--
BET's "How I'm Living"?

10:12.070 --> 10:15.240
I'd like to give a shout-out
to all five of my babies' mamas.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.867
High five, Laquifa.
I'm comin', girl.

10:16.909 --> 10:20.954
Yes, Lord!
Everybody. $100 million!

10:47.564 --> 10:50.067
Relax. Thank you.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.612
Wait a minute.
You the only sister.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.947
You can't say nothin'?

10:59.952 --> 11:02.621
What in the hell
is taking her so long?

11:02.704 --> 11:05.541
Relax, honey. She has arthritis.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.334
She's, like, 200 years old.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.585
I know. It's great.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.215
<i>Ready? Go.</i>

11:16.635 --> 11:18.595
Mr. Hunkee?

11:18.637 --> 11:21.473
- Yes.
- I've got good news and bad news.

11:21.557 --> 11:26.812
The bad news is that your flight 114
to JFK has been canceled.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.438
Oh, for the love of--

11:28.480 --> 11:31.275
But the good news is
we've been able to find

11:31.316 --> 11:35.696
another airline that can
accommodate you this evening.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.698
Would you be interested
in another airline?

11:37.781 --> 11:41.535
- Even Dad thinks you're cute.
- Get off me!

11:41.660 --> 11:44.079
- You're such a whore.
- What did you say?

11:44.163 --> 11:45.289
Did I stutter?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.916
There you are.

11:49.001 --> 11:55.841
Four tickets for flight 069
on NWA.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.886
What you're going to want to do
is go to Gate One--

11:58.969 --> 12:03.974
that's Terminal X--and we'll send
your luggage on down for you.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.518
- Thank you for your help.
- You're quite welcome.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.145
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

12:08.187 --> 12:09.563
Hey, sweetie.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.940
Don't get it greasy.
It's very expensive.

12:12.024 --> 12:13.650
I know, I bought it.

12:13.692 --> 12:17.237
Now, a gentleman always
carries a lady's bags.

12:17.362 --> 12:20.240
- So why are you carrying hers?
- Be kind, son.

12:20.324 --> 12:23.493
If I play my cards right,
she'll be your future mother figure.

12:23.535 --> 12:24.912
That's scary.

12:24.995 --> 12:27.247
Ooh, hey, sweetie.
Wait a minute.

12:27.331 --> 12:29.958
Don't look back
and not say anything.

12:30.042 --> 12:31.668
Excuse me.
You got to move, lady.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.712
Baby, come here.
Gimme a second.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.964
Girl, you must not know
who I am.

12:36.048 --> 12:39.009
Nashawn Wade, baby.
I own NWA. The boss.

12:39.051 --> 12:41.094
Where the hell is Terminal X?

12:41.178 --> 12:44.681
Relax, honey. Didn't we just have
a great vacation in Crackerland?

12:44.765 --> 12:48.644
No, we didn't--
give me that stupid hat. Leave it!

12:48.727 --> 12:51.688
You know what would've
been great? Going to Hawaii alone.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.148
Listen, you know the deal.

12:53.232 --> 12:55.234
I only get to see my kids
every other weekend.

12:55.359 --> 12:58.070
Billy, where's your sister?

12:59.071 --> 13:00.239
She's that way.

13:01.573 --> 13:02.908
Great.

13:06.245 --> 13:09.039
Heather, you can't just
walk away from the family.

13:09.081 --> 13:11.792
If you want to go somewhere,
you gotta ask permission first.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.378
Dad, I'm 18 years old.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.838
Sorry.

13:15.921 --> 13:18.924
She's 17. You are 17.

13:19.007 --> 13:23.262
Fine. For a couple more hours.
I am 17, and then I'll be 18.

13:23.387 --> 13:24.805
Then I can party and have sex.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.849
- Sex?! No, no.
- Yeah, sex.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.643
Missionary, doggie-style,
rockin' the baby,

13:29.726 --> 13:30.686
gettin' tea-bagged,

13:30.769 --> 13:33.522
playin' the trombone
while I'm tossin' his salad,

13:33.605 --> 13:36.567
hand jobs, ear jobs,
blow jobs.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.903
Gettin' a pearl necklace,
ridin' the bologna pony...

13:39.945 --> 13:41.780
- sucking--
- That's enough!

13:41.822 --> 13:43.699
- Did she say bologna?
- I don't know.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.410
...whenever I want, and best of all,
I won't have to listen to you.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.331
Can you believe that?

13:51.415 --> 13:55.127
What came after
getting tea-bagged?

13:55.252 --> 13:56.628
Something about the trombone.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.674
Okay, everybody,
congratulations!

14:00.799 --> 14:02.968
You guys have been punk'd!

14:03.051 --> 14:05.304
There's cameras everywhere,
right, son?

14:05.387 --> 14:08.056
We'll be back in five minutes
with the release forms.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.641
Let's go.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.984
Oh, shit! Awesome!

14:20.986 --> 14:25.574
- Terminal Malcolm X?
- Yeah.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.996
Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
Usually you gotta go to two places,

14:31.121 --> 14:33.499
- but there you get the one--
- This is a terminal?

14:33.582 --> 14:36.502
It's great, 99 cents. Everything.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.796
Oh, check out the car.

14:41.298 --> 14:44.301
This place has every--
there's a basketball court.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.180
In your face!

14:49.932 --> 14:52.059
Get your short ass on,
you leprechaun.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.810
Look like my ex--
short and stupid.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.187
Everything's short.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.772
I don't know about all that,

14:56.855 --> 15:00.484
but if Denzel walked his fine

15:00.567 --> 15:02.194
I'm takin' the rest of the day off

15:02.319 --> 15:05.239
and gettin' straight down
with the get down.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.365
You know what I'm sayin'?

15:06.490 --> 15:07.950
Girl, let me tell you,
Denzel is nice,

15:08.033 --> 15:09.201
but I like the young thugs.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.246
I love me some 50 Cent, baby.

15:12.371 --> 15:14.832
Ooh, Shaniece. Go, Shaniece!

15:14.915 --> 15:16.708
It's your birthday.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.710
We gonna party
like it's your birthday.

15:18.794 --> 15:20.712
Sip Bacardi
like it's my birthday.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.048
And you know we don't
give a fuck it's not my birthday!

15:25.259 --> 15:27.553
Look at this little nigga here.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.388
Look more like five cent.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.682
Nigga, can't you read?

15:31.723 --> 15:34.601
The sign says put
all metal objects in the container.

15:34.685 --> 15:37.187
Take your ass off.
Get on back there!

15:37.312 --> 15:38.355
Get your ass back there.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.148
Cheap ass.

15:40.232 --> 15:43.694
Shit goin' off 'cause that shit cheap.
That's why it's goin' off.

15:43.819 --> 15:46.029
My flow, my show
bought me the dough

15:46.071 --> 15:48.323
that bought me
all my fancy things.

15:48.407 --> 15:50.492
My cribs, my cars,
my pools, my jewels.

15:50.576 --> 15:52.411
Nigga, I done came up
and I ain't changed.

15:55.664 --> 15:56.790
Hold it!

15:56.874 --> 15:59.042
You keep fuckin' up
on my rhymes.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.420
Move it along, nickel.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.465
You wanna say somethin'?!

16:05.549 --> 16:07.593
I ain't slapped a bitch
in two weeks.

16:07.676 --> 16:09.178
Yeah, I got a whole lot
of strength

16:09.261 --> 16:10.762
in the slap-a-bitch arm.

16:14.516 --> 16:17.936
They had a whole bunch of dirty
magazines--bathing suit issues.

16:17.978 --> 16:21.190
Damn! So you like that, huh?
You gonna love this.

16:21.273 --> 16:24.568
Hold those for me, I won't be
needing those on this flight.

16:24.610 --> 16:25.944
Girl, what you got me--

16:31.325 --> 16:33.660
The sweet smell of Alizé.

16:34.953 --> 16:38.665
- Hunkee? Elvis Hunkee?
- Yeah.

16:38.749 --> 16:41.960
Karl Malone? I used to play
basketball with you in high school.

16:42.044 --> 16:45.464
That's right. We used to call you
"The Paperboy."

16:45.506 --> 16:47.841
Yeah, that was then.
I'm "The Mailman" now.

16:47.925 --> 16:48.926
That's good.

16:49.051 --> 16:52.012
My dad's a mailman, too.
Government jobs pay very well.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.014
You don't understand,
I play for the Lakers now.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.683
Right, Karl. I don't think
you understand.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.102
I used to play with you, man.
You can't shoot, remember?

16:59.144 --> 17:00.771
That's why we never
passed you the ball.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.898
I thought it was because
I was the only brother.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.025
No, Karl. It's 'cause you sucked!

17:05.108 --> 17:06.108
Oh, I sucked?

17:06.151 --> 17:09.488
What are you gonna do--
go all "postal" on me, Mr. Mailman?

17:10.321 --> 17:12.324
My man, what's goin' on, baby?

17:13.032 --> 17:15.077
Ah, that's nice.
That's real nice.

17:18.664 --> 17:21.625
I'd like to be them jeans.
Make no sense.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.422
Excuse me.
How you doin', man?

17:27.506 --> 17:29.424
Can I get through here,
sweetie?

17:29.508 --> 17:31.552
What's goin' on, fellas?
My man.

17:34.763 --> 17:36.473
When the buzzer pop, nigga,
you stop!

17:37.850 --> 17:39.560
Do y'all know who I am?

17:40.686 --> 17:42.938
We don't give a damn
about who you are.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.274
Let your little ass
take one more step...

17:45.357 --> 17:48.819
...we'll bury your ass in them fake-ass
iguana shoes you're wearin'.

17:49.862 --> 17:53.657
Ladies, it's me. It's Nashawn Wade,
owner of this airline.

17:53.699 --> 17:55.200
Come on, remember.
I hired y'all.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.201
- It's him.
- There ya go.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.954
That's a little more like it.
Thought you had amnesia.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.039
Yes, it is him!

18:01.165 --> 18:03.709
You that little nigga got his ass
caught in a toilet seat.

18:11.300 --> 18:14.595
All right, little player, go on, take
your little cute rich ass on through.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.013
Go ahead, little player.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.848
Bet that ass still tight,
ain't it?

18:19.600 --> 18:22.561
Shit, bitch. I hope we don't lose
our benefits over this.

18:22.644 --> 18:24.688
We sorry, Mr. Wade!

18:24.771 --> 18:26.356
My tooth is hurtin'.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.400
And it's fuckin'
with your breath, girl.

18:28.442 --> 18:30.110
Upsettin' all my insides here.

18:30.194 --> 18:31.862
Don't you say shit else
for a year.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.906
You done melted the whole side--

18:33.947 --> 18:35.949
That's what you get
for fuckin' us up.

18:44.249 --> 18:47.127
I'll tell ya, I knew I shoulda got
the new Aerostar.

18:47.211 --> 18:49.046
Check out the safety rating.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.089
I'm a little nervous.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.967
I heard someone say
this is the first flight for this airline.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.427
It has five cup holders.

18:55.511 --> 18:58.555
Honey, the FAA, they're very strict
about who they let fly an airline.

18:58.639 --> 18:59.932
It's gonna be okay, believe me.

18:59.973 --> 19:03.268
Yeah, I know, but I think we're
the only white people on the plane.

19:03.352 --> 19:04.853
Girlfriend, like your bag.

19:04.937 --> 19:05.938
Honey, no, we're not.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.023
You ain't gonna pick me up?!

19:09.191 --> 19:12.611
Maybe it's a coincidence,
you know, like a family reunion?

19:12.653 --> 19:13.987
Million Man March?

19:32.047 --> 19:35.259
Hey, what are you...
Hey, stop that!

19:42.015 --> 19:43.308
Yeah, what up, son?

19:43.392 --> 19:46.645
Yeah, yeah.
You know I'm like that.

19:46.687 --> 19:47.896
I'm like that.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.189
Damn. What up?

19:49.273 --> 19:52.401
Here's your card, Dad.
I think I melted the sucka.

19:52.484 --> 19:54.111
Put everything on it
but an Escalade.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.030
I'm a holler at the shorty
I saw at the basketball courts.

19:58.866 --> 20:00.492
One love, dawg.

20:01.577 --> 20:03.203
Where's my son?

20:07.499 --> 20:09.751
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

20:09.835 --> 20:12.254
You doin' good?
You feel wonderful.

20:12.337 --> 20:16.300
- Yeah. All right.
- Hey. whoa! That's my zipper!

20:16.341 --> 20:19.428
And that's too loud
for a zipper.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.346
I don't know
what you got in there,

20:21.388 --> 20:22.890
but we gonna find out.

20:22.973 --> 20:26.101
- I got a plane to catch.
- Come with me.

20:28.562 --> 20:31.315
Did you hear me, boy?!

20:31.982 --> 20:36.445
I bet you ain't never seen
a chocolate super-deluxe woman

20:36.528 --> 20:37.571
like me before.

20:38.530 --> 20:39.823
Have you?

20:41.492 --> 20:45.537
No, I got a plane to catch.
I gotta go!

20:47.456 --> 20:50.292
Where do you think
you're goin', player?

20:50.375 --> 20:51.502
I'm gonna get on--

20:51.543 --> 20:55.464
We feds now,
which means I can violate

20:55.547 --> 20:59.593
every last one
of your civil rights.

20:59.676 --> 21:02.679
Now drop them drawers...
Denzel.

21:02.804 --> 21:06.141
Denzel? Look, lady.
I just want--

21:06.183 --> 21:08.060
Drop them drawers!

21:08.101 --> 21:11.104
Show me that ass, nigga!

21:12.064 --> 21:13.732
Now turn around.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.693
Cavity check!

21:29.915 --> 21:32.376
Girl, there was duct tape
and peanut butter everywhere.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.796
I told him, I don't care
if you are a diplomat.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.506
I don't bend into that position.

21:37.589 --> 21:40.425
Girl, I ain't no circus freak.
This ain't Cirque du Soleil.

21:43.679 --> 21:44.680
He's a fool.

21:44.763 --> 21:46.765
Mi vida,
you did the right thing.

21:46.807 --> 21:48.267
Mi primo tried that once.

21:48.308 --> 21:51.144
The doctors still can't find
his left nut.

21:51.228 --> 21:52.896
They say it's up there
somewhere.

21:52.938 --> 21:55.732
Give me his address.
I'll find it.

21:57.276 --> 21:58.652
Hey, Muggsy!

21:58.735 --> 22:00.237
Flame, not now.

22:01.947 --> 22:03.782
Where's the pilots
you hired, man?

22:03.866 --> 22:05.826
- Come on, dawg--
- It's not come on now.

22:05.909 --> 22:08.203
We're supposed to take off
in 20 minutes.

22:08.287 --> 22:09.496
Calm down, Little Bow-Wow.

22:09.580 --> 22:10.664
He'll be here, all right?

22:10.747 --> 22:13.375
- There he go right there.
- Who, him?

22:13.458 --> 22:14.668
- Yeah, him.
- Right there?

22:14.751 --> 22:15.836
- Right there.
- Him?

22:19.548 --> 22:21.216
- Him right there?
- Yeah, him right there.

22:27.264 --> 22:28.807
I told you to hire
a black pilot,

22:28.891 --> 22:30.851
not no black baggage handler.
What is that?

22:30.934 --> 22:33.395
I did what
you asked me to, okay?

22:33.478 --> 22:35.230
There ain't but two
black pilots around,

22:35.314 --> 22:36.690
and one of 'em flyin' for Puffy.

22:36.773 --> 22:37.774
How'd Puffy get that one?

22:37.816 --> 22:40.569
- Don't worry.
- You're right, I'm just nervous.

22:40.652 --> 22:45.073
I got his resumé right there.
My dawg, what's up, baby?

22:45.157 --> 22:47.451
What's goin' on, Muggs?
How you been?

22:47.493 --> 22:48.577
What's up, man?

22:48.660 --> 22:50.996
- How are you, man?
- Ain't nothin' to it but do it.

22:51.121 --> 22:53.290
Nashawn, Captain Mack.
Captain Mack, Nashawn.

22:53.373 --> 22:54.708
My pleasure, brother.

22:54.791 --> 22:55.959
Hey. You're late, man.

22:56.043 --> 22:57.961
Don't worry about me bein' late.

22:58.003 --> 23:01.381
I'm gonna take this hooptie of yours
up another 1,000 feet,

23:01.507 --> 23:05.135
catch me a slipstream, and we
gonna be there five minutes early.

23:05.219 --> 23:08.180
Real slick like hair grease,
but with less mess.

23:08.263 --> 23:10.682
- Can you dig it?
- Hell, yeah, I can dig it.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.017
You really gonna do that?

23:12.100 --> 23:14.019
No, I'm just fuckin' with ya.

23:15.771 --> 23:18.607
Y'all two know each other?
He was fuckin' with me.

23:19.608 --> 23:21.360
Muggs, I'm really
not playin' right now.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.945
I'm not, Muggs.

23:23.028 --> 23:24.571
I was lookin' at
your resumé, man.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.156
I see that you flew
in Desert Storm.

23:26.198 --> 23:28.534
- That's pretty impressive.
- Actually, that's a typo.

23:28.617 --> 23:29.785
I drew over in Desert Storm.

23:29.868 --> 23:31.703
I'm sorry. I didn't..
what you say?

23:31.787 --> 23:34.373
I was the nigga that drew
the little sayings on the bombs:

23:34.456 --> 23:37.292
"Fuck Iraq." "Saddam, eat a dick."
That was me.

23:37.376 --> 23:38.502
Secret agent.

23:38.585 --> 23:41.046
Matter of fact, I ain't even
'posed to be talkin' about that.

23:41.088 --> 23:42.130
That's classified.

23:42.214 --> 23:45.384
What the fuck?! Do you even
know how to fly a plane, man?

23:45.467 --> 23:47.094
I got my wings when I got out.

23:47.177 --> 23:48.679
Got your wings
when you got out?

23:48.720 --> 23:52.975
You right. Plus I ain't really got
another choice right now.

23:54.142 --> 23:55.185
Where's your uniform?

23:55.269 --> 23:56.436
You lookin' at it.

23:56.562 --> 23:58.272
The Mackin' is crackin'.
This is how I come.

23:58.397 --> 23:59.731
I don't wear no square suits.

23:59.815 --> 24:01.733
I'm a player.
We ride spinners.

24:01.817 --> 24:04.194
Ride spinners
and you write on bombs.

24:04.236 --> 24:05.654
That's classified.

24:05.737 --> 24:07.072
I'm gonna tell you what.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.950
Get us there safe.
Can you do that?

24:10.033 --> 24:12.411
You somethin' else, Muggs.
Drew on bombs.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.913
- Excuse me, man,
- Yes, sir.

24:14.955 --> 24:16.540
That's about a bitch.

24:16.582 --> 24:18.625
- Where the cockpit at?
- You got that bong?

24:18.709 --> 24:21.170
Whole bag of it, Preach.

24:21.253 --> 24:23.338
- I gotta go.
- Do I pay you to talk on the phone?

24:23.422 --> 24:25.591
Look at the captain.
He is too cute.

24:28.927 --> 24:30.762
Hi, Captain.

24:30.846 --> 24:33.932
- At ease, ladies.
- Hi, fly boy.

24:34.057 --> 24:35.851
I just love the look
of a man in uniform.

24:37.102 --> 24:40.230
'Course, I like the look of a man
out of uniform even better.

24:43.734 --> 24:47.404
This is some cool shit
fit for a real nigga.

24:47.487 --> 24:50.199
Hey, what's poppin',
my aeronautical hustlers?

24:50.282 --> 24:51.783
Captain Mack,
reporting to duty.

24:51.867 --> 24:53.952
How you doin'. Captain?
I'm Riggs. your flight engineer.

24:54.036 --> 24:55.204
Have you ever met Gaeman?

24:55.287 --> 24:58.415
I just seen one of them
fruity motherfuckers in the hallway.

24:58.457 --> 25:00.042
Nigga was eyeballin' me.

25:00.125 --> 25:03.253
It's Gaeman, I am Leslie Gaeman,
your copilot.

25:03.337 --> 25:04.588
What's happenin'?

25:04.671 --> 25:06.798
It's a very prestigious
African name--

25:06.924 --> 25:10.302
not like "gay man,"
two men fucking together, naked,

25:10.385 --> 25:13.138
- in a bedroom. Not me.
- Whatever, homey.

25:13.222 --> 25:15.140
I like pussy like you.

25:16.350 --> 25:18.560
- I can dig it.
- Yeah, you can dig it.

25:18.644 --> 25:20.854
Everybody will be pregnant
by the end of this flight.

25:21.772 --> 25:23.023
Hello.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.818
First class.
Right this way, big daddy.

25:28.487 --> 25:30.322
Welcome to NWA.

25:31.573 --> 25:34.243
Hi. How's everybody?

25:34.326 --> 25:36.912
Good. Wow, this is great!

25:36.995 --> 25:40.082
Oh, y'all are in low class.

25:40.165 --> 25:43.001
- What?
- Low class, straight back.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.172
This is nice, too.

25:47.256 --> 25:49.883
Dad, this actually
isn't that bad.

26:00.435 --> 26:02.354
What kind of UPN operation
is this?

26:02.396 --> 26:04.106
It's not so bad.

26:06.817 --> 26:08.652
All right, here we are.

26:09.820 --> 26:15.117
Row 1 7 Chrysler.
Honey, you sit here.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.410
Thank you.

26:16.493 --> 26:18.954
- Do I have to sit...
- How you doin'?

26:21.331 --> 26:24.334
You're gonna have to, okay?
Thank you.

26:24.376 --> 26:27.796
Let's please
put the divider down.

26:29.089 --> 26:32.509
Do you have an "off" switch?
You need to lower the volume.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.387
Man, you give a black man
some money,

26:35.470 --> 26:38.724
this is how the airline's
gonna look--plush, laid.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.018
It's makin' me feel sexy
already.

26:41.059 --> 26:42.394
This is a sexy plane.

26:42.519 --> 26:44.813
They got it chromed out
with the white leather.

26:44.897 --> 26:47.232
I think this is alligator butt.

26:48.901 --> 26:50.611
Yeah, this is nice.

26:50.694 --> 26:52.863
Little treat for you
before the plane takes off, daddy,

26:52.905 --> 26:54.990
'cause you treat me so right.

26:55.073 --> 26:57.075
You nasty!

27:03.081 --> 27:04.291
Can I help you, sir?

27:04.374 --> 27:06.752
Everything's okay,
I'm just trying to find my seat,

27:12.674 --> 27:14.259
Boy, this a nice plane.

27:15.636 --> 27:17.638
Nice cushion they got
on these new planes.

27:17.721 --> 27:20.682
This must be
one of them 777's.

27:20.766 --> 27:23.477
7574327.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.687
Where my seat? 777.

27:25.771 --> 27:27.397
The president
should fly on this plane.

27:29.733 --> 27:31.777
- Hello, sir.
- Hey, baby, how you doin'?

27:31.860 --> 27:34.696
- I'm gonna show you to your seat.
- That's nice of you, cutie pie.

27:36.114 --> 27:38.492
- Here we are.
- Let me shake your hand.

27:38.575 --> 27:42.287
Come here. Oh, boy!
That's nice. Look at that.

27:42.371 --> 27:45.707
Boy, I can just hear everything.

27:45.791 --> 27:49.503
It's so beautiful in here.
Wait a minute.

27:49.628 --> 27:52.130
Somebody got
some nice perfume on.

27:52.256 --> 27:54.591
Is that
Victoria Don't Tell Nobody?

27:54.633 --> 27:58.428
- No.
- Is that Boujeronee?

27:59.638 --> 28:01.139
Not Boujeronee either.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.976
I like the people
that don't talk back.

28:04.017 --> 28:05.811
Hard to get, I like that.

28:07.855 --> 28:09.147
Cabin attendant?

28:09.189 --> 28:10.440
Yes, sir?

28:10.524 --> 28:13.527
Howdy do.
Where are you, baby?

28:13.610 --> 28:14.945
There you are.

28:14.987 --> 28:20.075
Get me a quadruple cognac
and a cola back.

28:20.159 --> 28:23.954
You know, I'm scared to fly.
I'm used to ridin' buses.

28:24.037 --> 28:26.832
My little nephew
sent me on first class,

28:26.915 --> 28:28.625
because I'm a player.

28:29.501 --> 28:31.295
You smell good, too.

28:32.963 --> 28:36.216
I'm gonna have me some fun
on this plane here.

28:36.300 --> 28:40.053
Okey-dokey. So you're
gonna be in...

28:42.472 --> 28:46.768
You're gonna go ahead
to low class, okay.

28:49.855 --> 28:51.982
- He tasted like chocolate.
- No way.

29:00.115 --> 29:02.034
My God, what's going on?

29:07.164 --> 29:08.582
Get the fuck out!

29:08.665 --> 29:10.667
What is he doing?
Watch him.

29:14.505 --> 29:16.381
Y'all better get his ass!

29:28.227 --> 29:30.437
You ain't goin' nowhere
without us, Osama.

29:30.562 --> 29:33.440
If you gots to go
to the bathroom, we goin' with you.

29:33.524 --> 29:35.901
She holdin'
and I'm shakin', player.

29:35.984 --> 29:38.570
- That's right.
- It's cool, y'all. We got this.

29:38.654 --> 29:40.447
We security up in here.
Look straight.

29:45.077 --> 29:46.286
- Hi.
- Hey.

29:46.370 --> 29:48.455
This first class is incredible.

29:48.539 --> 29:50.999
Girl, this plane is off the hook.
Have you seen the owner?

29:51.083 --> 29:54.503
He's young, black, and from
the pictures I've seen,

29:54.586 --> 29:55.671
he looks so good.

29:55.754 --> 29:57.172
I'm sure he's great.

29:57.256 --> 29:59.925
<i>- And he's paid.
- Please direct your attention</i>

30:00.008 --> 30:02.594
<i>to the screen in front of you
for a safety video.</i>

30:20.612 --> 30:22.030
What is this?

30:22.114 --> 30:23.991
<i>Now that you got on our plane
and you be listenin'</i>

30:24.074 --> 30:27.286
<i>You better just do as we say
or you'll be missin'</i>

30:27.369 --> 30:30.873
<i>Better put your seatbelt on
or you'll be dyin'</i>

30:30.956 --> 30:33.125
<i>If the plane goes crazy,
then you will not be flyin'</i>

30:33.208 --> 30:36.003
<i>Now we direct you to
the nearest locations</i>

30:36.086 --> 30:39.089
<i>Where you might desire
to exit your vacations</i>

30:39.131 --> 30:42.259
<i>If we lose the pressure,
you'll be chokin'</i>

30:42.342 --> 30:45.804
<i>Or if there's a fire,
then you'll be smokin'</i>

30:45.888 --> 30:47.764
<i>The oxygen we will be providin'</i>

30:47.806 --> 30:50.267
This some black shit here.

30:50.309 --> 30:52.769
<i>You're a survivor</i>

30:52.811 --> 30:54.813
- Here we go.
- There we go.

30:54.855 --> 30:57.065
<i>You're a survivor,
you'll keep on flyin'</i>

30:57.149 --> 31:01.195
<i>You're a survivor,
you don't go down there</i>

31:01.278 --> 31:03.655
Honey, what is this?

31:03.739 --> 31:05.908
<i>You're a survivor,
you not be dyin'</i>

31:05.991 --> 31:08.827
<i>You're a survivor,
you'll keep on flyin'</i>

31:08.911 --> 31:12.206
<i>You're a survivor,
you don't go down there</i>

31:12.331 --> 31:14.500
<i>You're a survivor,
you got your fair share</i>

31:14.625 --> 31:16.668
<i>You're a survivor</i>

31:16.793 --> 31:21.215
<i>Whoo, you're a survivor</i>

31:26.428 --> 31:27.804
There's the owner right there.

31:31.099 --> 31:33.644
<i>Hello, everybody.
Welcome to NWA Airlines.</i>

31:33.727 --> 31:36.396
<i>Here at NWA, safety is
a very important part of flying,</i>

31:36.480 --> 31:37.689
<i>but let's be real.</i>

31:37.773 --> 31:40.442
<i>If something goes wrong,
we're all going down, right?</i>

31:40.526 --> 31:42.611
Is that supposed to be funny?

31:44.071 --> 31:45.614
<i>I'm just kiddin'--I'm playin'.</i>

31:45.697 --> 31:47.699
<i>That's why it's our policy
that fun comes first.</i>

31:47.741 --> 31:49.868
<i>So please, sit back, relax,
and enjoy your flight.</i>

31:49.993 --> 31:51.203
<i>You're a survivor.</i>

31:52.287 --> 31:53.705
<i>You are.</i>

32:04.007 --> 32:05.676
Come on, now, stop it.

32:05.717 --> 32:07.427
You got a brother
feelin' like the president.

32:07.511 --> 32:09.388
God bless America.

32:13.892 --> 32:14.893
Giselle?

32:16.144 --> 32:17.604
I gotta get outta here.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.690
Giselle, wait.

32:19.815 --> 32:21.775
Giselle, can you
wait a minute, please?

32:21.900 --> 32:22.860
What, Nashawn?

32:22.943 --> 32:25.404
What do we possibly
have to talk about?

32:26.780 --> 32:28.782
Wow, I mean, you look great.

32:31.118 --> 32:32.703
How you been?

32:32.786 --> 32:35.664
I've been fine. Just fine.

32:37.499 --> 32:38.792
Is that all?

32:39.918 --> 32:42.212
Actually, no, I mean.
I was doin' some thinkin'.

32:42.254 --> 32:43.714
and I wanna talk to you.

32:44.923 --> 32:47.009
Can I at least talk to you?

32:47.092 --> 32:49.887
Giselle, where you gonna go?
The door is closed.

32:52.890 --> 32:54.057
What's this?

32:54.183 --> 32:55.934
Someone stepped up,
Nashawn.

32:56.018 --> 32:57.895
I'm engaged.

33:11.283 --> 33:14.661
Hey, baby. It's not
a good time right now.

33:17.956 --> 33:20.709
There's no easy way
for me...

33:20.792 --> 33:23.128
for me to say this...

33:24.838 --> 33:26.632
What?

33:26.757 --> 33:28.634
This isn't workin' for me
anymore.

33:28.675 --> 33:29.801
What's not workin'?

33:34.473 --> 33:37.100
- This is gettin' way too serious.
- What are you talkin' about?

33:40.771 --> 33:41.813
I can't do this anymore.

33:41.897 --> 33:43.857
- I can't.
- No.

33:45.317 --> 33:47.194
You got change of a 50, man?

33:50.823 --> 33:54.326
- Not right now, Muggs.
- Not now?

33:55.410 --> 33:56.829
What's his problem, man?

34:04.545 --> 34:05.838
Oh, boy.

34:09.132 --> 34:11.885
Hey, hey, there, Blanca.

34:11.969 --> 34:16.514
I was wondering if I could
trouble you for a drink.

34:16.598 --> 34:18.851
Ain't no drink down there.

34:18.934 --> 34:20.435
Hell there ain't.

34:20.518 --> 34:22.813
I don't know if I ever
told you this,

34:22.855 --> 34:25.690
but I speak a little Español.

34:25.732 --> 34:27.192
Really?

34:47.337 --> 34:48.922
Testicles, one, two.

34:50.966 --> 34:52.759
Hey, y'all, what's crackalackin'?

34:52.842 --> 34:56.847
This is your soul plane chauffeur,
Captain Antoine Mack speaking.

34:56.889 --> 34:58.515
He sounds nice.

34:58.599 --> 35:01.059
<i>Welcome aboard NWA</i>

35:01.143 --> 35:05.647
flight 069 from the 310
to the 212.

35:05.731 --> 35:07.691
It's time
to bust this corner, y'all.

35:07.774 --> 35:09.234
<i>In a hot second,</i>

35:09.318 --> 35:10.736
I'll be hittin' them switches

35:10.819 --> 35:12.905
and gettin' this bitch
pumpin' and jumpin'.

35:12.988 --> 35:14.323
What?!

35:14.406 --> 35:18.118
So screw your shit on tight
and enjoy the flight.

35:18.202 --> 35:19.411
What did he say?

35:19.495 --> 35:22.539
He was just saying that we'll be
leaving in a couple of seconds,

35:22.623 --> 35:24.917
so put your seatbelt on,
make sure they're tight.

35:26.335 --> 35:27.878
Amateurs.

35:29.922 --> 35:32.299
- Why didn't he say so?
- Exactly.

35:34.051 --> 35:37.429
Yo, Gaeman, why don't you
go secure the cockpit, homey?

35:38.430 --> 35:41.558
Yes. Right away.

35:51.109 --> 35:52.736
This motherfucker is locked.

35:59.117 --> 36:01.995
Fred G. Sanford, my nigga.

36:02.120 --> 36:05.290
And the "G" is for
goin' places. Can you dig it?

36:08.418 --> 36:10.379
Now we ready to roll.

36:19.972 --> 36:22.474
Nigga got switches
in this motherfucker.

36:25.936 --> 36:27.813
Shit. And they work.

36:27.896 --> 36:28.939
What?

36:28.981 --> 36:31.358
This motherfucker hot, cuz.

36:31.441 --> 36:35.362
- Oh, my God!
- Bounce with me.

36:35.445 --> 36:37.156
This motherfucker's fucked up.

36:37.239 --> 36:39.074
- Like a elephant.
- Yeah.

36:40.784 --> 36:41.785
Bounce, bounce.

36:43.495 --> 36:45.497
I have the perfect music
for this.

36:45.622 --> 36:47.833
Yes, I have it right here.

36:55.048 --> 36:56.592
Hey, man, hold on, man.

36:56.675 --> 36:59.094
- Hold the fuck on.
- Like elephant.

36:59.178 --> 37:01.555
No, man, you gotta
turn that bullshit off.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.307
We can't be ridin'
to that bullshit, man.

37:03.348 --> 37:04.558
Don't insult my music.

37:04.641 --> 37:07.102
We ridin' to some gangsta shit.
Pop that in, man.

37:07.186 --> 37:09.479
Captain don't wanna hear
that Zimbabwe ah-wah-wah shit.

37:09.521 --> 37:11.857
Get that shit out.
Get it the fuck outta here.

37:11.940 --> 37:13.734
I'm the captain
of this motherfuckin' ship.

38:15.879 --> 38:18.882
Captain, what the hell
is wrong with you?

38:22.052 --> 38:24.221
Man, I'm afraid of heights.

38:24.304 --> 38:25.889
Afraid of heights?!

38:31.061 --> 38:33.230
Hit her with a bat,
hit her with a bat

38:33.313 --> 38:35.107
Hit her with a whoo-whoo

38:38.443 --> 38:42.072
- Easy, Kobe. She's 17.
- Dad, I'm 18.

38:49.997 --> 38:51.874
Honey, I'm gonna
excuse myself

38:51.957 --> 38:54.793
- and go to the restroom.
- Okay.

38:58.797 --> 39:01.258
I think I'm gonna go
check out the plane.

39:01.341 --> 39:02.634
Is that all right?

39:02.718 --> 39:06.305
- Why are you so nice to me?
- Stay for a while.

39:11.435 --> 39:14.730
Oh, my sweet black Jesus!

39:17.107 --> 39:18.358
Hey, good evenin'.

39:18.442 --> 39:19.776
I didn't know
anybody was in here.

39:19.818 --> 39:22.321
- I'll come back later.
- Why? I'm still gonna be here.

39:22.404 --> 39:23.780
I tell you what.

39:23.822 --> 39:26.325
You take care of your business,
I take care of mine.

39:26.366 --> 39:29.161
I just don't feel comfortable,
I'll just hold it.

39:29.203 --> 39:31.205
You don't want to do that.

39:31.288 --> 39:34.958
That stuff back up on you,
top of your head fly clean off.

39:35.083 --> 39:36.460
Sit down,
make yourself at home.

39:36.502 --> 39:37.711
I'm sorry.

39:37.794 --> 39:40.422
We don't get that many of y'all
on the plane.

39:40.506 --> 39:42.966
For those with no junk
in their trunk.

39:43.842 --> 39:45.177
That is a nice vest.

39:45.260 --> 39:47.471
I ain't seen one of them
since Lionel and the Jeffersons.

39:47.554 --> 39:50.307
What ever happened to Lionel?
I thought he was--

39:50.349 --> 39:51.350
Would you mind?

39:51.433 --> 39:53.894
Oh, I'm sorry.
Little fella kinda shy?

39:59.066 --> 40:00.609
Goddamn!

40:00.692 --> 40:01.944
Sorry.

40:02.027 --> 40:04.112
I guess you can't have lightnin'
without the thunder.

40:04.196 --> 40:06.198
Somebody still likes
that pork, I see.

40:06.281 --> 40:09.868
I think this was a false alarm.
I'm gonna go back to my seat.

40:09.993 --> 40:11.161
The paint is peeling.

40:12.871 --> 40:14.581
That must be a big one.

40:14.665 --> 40:16.291
Yeah, it's big.

40:16.375 --> 40:17.584
I've got just the thing.

40:38.772 --> 40:42.234
I can't believe that
this is you.

40:42.359 --> 40:44.278
So you subscribe to
"Black & Proud"?

40:44.361 --> 40:47.447
This is the first time
I've picked it up.

40:47.531 --> 40:49.616
Yeah, it was freezin'
that day.

40:49.700 --> 40:53.495
Really? You could never tell that
from the picture.

40:53.579 --> 40:55.455
Why, thank you.

40:55.539 --> 40:58.917
Usually, the problem is, I'm hangin'
out the bottom of my boxers.

40:58.959 --> 41:01.044
Oh, my goodness.

41:01.170 --> 41:02.838
Hi.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.923
I think you're in my seat.

41:05.007 --> 41:07.426
Oh, hi, honey.
This is Jerome.

41:07.509 --> 41:08.552
Hi.

41:08.635 --> 41:09.636
Hello.

41:09.720 --> 41:13.432
Jerome was telling me about how he
hangs out the bottom of his boxers.

41:13.557 --> 41:15.309
That's nice.

41:15.392 --> 41:17.060
They're about to serve dinner,

41:17.144 --> 41:19.021
so you might want
to go back to your chair.

41:21.106 --> 41:24.401
Oh, yeah. You're right.

41:24.443 --> 41:25.569
Yeah.

41:25.611 --> 41:27.196
It was nice meetin' you.

41:27.279 --> 41:28.780
It was nice meeting you, too, Barbara.

41:28.864 --> 41:30.991
Nice meeting you, too, Jerome.

41:33.452 --> 41:34.495
Bye.

41:40.542 --> 41:42.753
Hangin' out
the bottom of his boxers--

41:42.794 --> 41:44.338
My God, is that him?!

41:45.964 --> 41:49.885
- That thing has a face on it,
- No, but it's gonna.

41:52.304 --> 41:53.347
Are you all right, sir?

41:53.472 --> 41:55.933
Course, I'm all right,
I'm a G, ain't I?

41:56.016 --> 41:57.518
I will make the announcement.

41:57.601 --> 42:00.103
No, you won't.
Give me this motherfucker.

42:00.187 --> 42:02.272
I'm makin' the announcement.
I'm the captain.

42:02.648 --> 42:06.527
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
reached our cruising altitude

42:06.610 --> 42:08.529
of 33,000 feet,

42:08.612 --> 42:10.697
33,000 feet?!

42:10.781 --> 42:13.951
Oh, shit, man. We fuckin' higher
than Redman at the Source awards.

42:14.034 --> 42:15.994
<i>Shit don't make
no motherfuckin' sense</i>

42:16.036 --> 42:17.538
<i>to be this high, cuz.</i>

42:17.663 --> 42:20.374
Man, I feel sick. Oh, fuck.

42:22.584 --> 42:23.961
Ain't this some shit?

42:27.297 --> 42:28.757
What the hell's goin' on here?

42:28.841 --> 42:30.843
This nigga's afraid of heights.

42:30.926 --> 42:33.262
How you gonna be afraid
of heights if you the captain?

42:33.345 --> 42:34.930
I ain't never
been off the ground before.

42:35.013 --> 42:36.515
We've flown computer
simulators.

42:36.598 --> 42:40.561
You told me you got your wings
when you got out the Air Force.

42:40.644 --> 42:42.187
No, I didn't.

42:42.271 --> 42:44.481
I told you I got my wings
when I got out.

42:44.523 --> 42:47.234
When I got out of Pelican Bay
State Corrections Facility.

42:47.317 --> 42:50.362
It was either get a GED
or take a pilot class.

42:50.445 --> 42:52.447
You learned how to fly
in the prison?

42:52.531 --> 42:54.533
Hey, man, don't get mad
'cause I spent your money

42:54.575 --> 42:55.534
to get a good education.

42:55.659 --> 42:59.580
Shit, me and my homeboys
passed the class with flying colors.

42:59.663 --> 43:01.665
Let me see.

43:01.748 --> 43:04.001
- I miss them niggas, man.
- Those are his niggas.

43:04.042 --> 43:05.669
The Taliban.

43:06.712 --> 43:08.463
I'm gonna tell you what.

43:08.547 --> 43:11.550
Y'all better fix it.
Gay-man, Captain Mack--

43:11.633 --> 43:12.634
It's Gaeman!

43:12.718 --> 43:14.553
I don't give a damn.
Fix it.

43:14.636 --> 43:16.555
I'm no bitch, you understand?
It's Gaeman.

43:16.638 --> 43:19.057
You gonna be a gay man.
Fix it.

43:19.099 --> 43:21.018
Put this shit on autopilot.

43:21.059 --> 43:23.687
I'm goin' to the lavatory.
I got to boo-boo.

43:26.815 --> 43:29.610
- What ya doin'?
- I'm countin' my tips.

43:29.693 --> 43:32.654
- Tips from where?
- Back there,

43:36.658 --> 43:38.577
...low class motherfucker.

43:43.123 --> 43:45.792
Hey, nigga! Oh, boss man.

43:49.379 --> 43:50.672
Hey, man, you mind
if I get in here?

43:50.756 --> 43:51.757
Come on.

43:51.840 --> 43:54.718
Hold on. Got a new shooter.

43:54.760 --> 43:57.012
- One shot, baby, you in?
- No.

43:57.095 --> 43:58.430
Nigga, is ya in? What?

43:58.514 --> 44:00.432
- You said I could run business class, right?
- Yeah, I did.

44:00.557 --> 44:02.684
So I'm runnin' this motherfucker
like Vegas on fight night.

44:02.768 --> 44:04.603
We got a cockfight
we settin' up in ten minutes.

44:04.645 --> 44:06.605
Cockfight?! I'm in.

44:08.774 --> 44:10.651
No. Let me tell you over here.

44:10.734 --> 44:12.611
I don't even want
everybody in my business.

44:12.653 --> 44:13.904
Hold me down.

44:16.698 --> 44:18.992
- What's up, cuz?
- You know what?

44:19.076 --> 44:20.452
I'm not even gonna make
a scene in here.

44:20.536 --> 44:22.538
I'm goin' back
to the front of the plane.

44:22.621 --> 44:25.749
When I get back here,
I want this to be business class.

44:25.791 --> 44:28.836
- Okay. You got it, man.
- You can do that for me?

44:28.919 --> 44:30.629
My man. Thank you, Muggs.

44:35.717 --> 44:37.344
Would you like
champagne or wine?

44:37.469 --> 44:38.470
We'll have champagne.

44:38.595 --> 44:40.180
Would you like Moet or Cristal?

44:41.932 --> 44:45.102
Motit...et. Moet.

44:45.185 --> 44:46.854
All right.

44:46.937 --> 44:49.565
I know you have a drinking problem,
so please drink slow.

44:50.941 --> 44:54.444
That's for you. And sir,
please don't swallow your ice.

44:54.486 --> 44:56.071
That's all I can afford
to give you.

44:57.239 --> 45:01.285
Hello. Would you like Colt .45
or Alizé?

45:03.745 --> 45:05.581
Maybe you could explain to us
what those are.

45:05.664 --> 45:06.999
My pleasure, sir.

45:07.082 --> 45:09.543
Colt .45 tastes like
liquored-up beer,

45:09.626 --> 45:11.670
and it sneaks up on you
all of a sudden.

45:13.005 --> 45:15.716
And Alizé--oh, that's my favorite.
It's from France.

45:15.799 --> 45:17.509
It's a cog-nac, it's very fruity,

45:17.593 --> 45:19.469
and it'll make you wanna do
the hucklebuck,

45:19.511 --> 45:21.805
then pass out
in your own juices.

45:21.847 --> 45:23.182
Guess I'll have that.

45:23.223 --> 45:24.558
Wise choice.

45:24.641 --> 45:26.977
Yo, player, you got a little
somethin'-somethin' for me?

45:27.019 --> 45:29.188
Yeah, I have a shorty 40.

45:29.271 --> 45:32.649
No, no. Do you have
any whole milk?

45:32.691 --> 45:33.692
Sir, that is nasty.

45:33.775 --> 45:37.821
I do have a Puerto Rican lady who's
lactatin', I'll see what I can do.

45:39.531 --> 45:42.034
Tonight, we're serving a plate
of gourmet soul food

45:42.159 --> 45:44.536
with your choice of lobster
and filet mignon

45:44.620 --> 45:47.247
or crisp duck confit,

45:47.331 --> 45:48.707
I'll have the filet,

45:53.879 --> 45:55.339
And for you, sir?

45:55.380 --> 45:58.717
I ordered a special
Kosher meal... yag-weh.

45:58.759 --> 46:00.010
Excuse me?

46:00.093 --> 46:02.012
That's fried chicken
in hot sauce.

46:02.054 --> 46:05.307
Lobster, filet mignon or duck?

46:05.390 --> 46:07.851
I'll take the fee-lan.

46:09.561 --> 46:12.397
All right, I need you to take
a breast or a leg and a wing

46:12.481 --> 46:14.650
and pass it back. Exactly.

46:14.733 --> 46:17.027
You guys, share your napkins
with your neighbor.

46:17.069 --> 46:19.988
One for every two people.
Sharing is caring.

46:20.072 --> 46:21.406
Don't get greedy. One piece.

46:21.448 --> 46:24.034
Hi. Would you like
some dessert?

46:26.662 --> 46:28.622
Boss man, low class
is outta liquor,

46:28.705 --> 46:31.291
so I thought I would
come in here and...

46:35.879 --> 46:38.340
Someone is strollin' down
memory lane.

46:40.717 --> 46:43.720
No, I'm just, you know,
checkin' on things,

46:43.804 --> 46:45.305
makin' sure they okay,
that's all.

46:45.389 --> 46:47.516
Yeah, right. I know that look.

46:47.599 --> 46:50.602
I had that same look of regret
after I ran into Lee--

46:50.727 --> 46:53.230
my little Asian butterfly.

46:53.313 --> 46:56.692
We had a whirlwind romance
that ended in heartbreak...

46:56.775 --> 46:58.944
and stomach pumpin'.

46:59.027 --> 47:03.407
When I saw him again,
I tried to apologize, but I couldn't.

47:03.490 --> 47:06.076
I just felt so bad leaving him
in that hospital

47:06.118 --> 47:07.828
all bloated and distended.

47:07.911 --> 47:09.079
Did you just grind on me?

47:09.121 --> 47:10.581
A little.

47:10.622 --> 47:12.958
What does that sick-ass story
have to do with me?

47:13.041 --> 47:14.960
I've never left nobody
in the hospital filled with nothin'.

47:15.043 --> 47:17.254
It means, Mr. Righteous,
that if you have a chance

47:17.379 --> 47:18.922
to make things right again,
you should take it.

47:19.006 --> 47:20.757
Who knows
what could've happened?

47:20.883 --> 47:25.262
Lee had plenty ancient secret
to show me.

47:25.304 --> 47:28.390
Thank you. Flame.
Okay?

47:28.473 --> 47:30.434
You're welcome.

47:35.022 --> 47:38.484
Now, how much Colt .45
to Sierra Mist do you mix

47:38.525 --> 47:41.069
to get bubbly?
Probably half and half.

47:42.446 --> 47:43.572
You mind if I sit down?

47:43.655 --> 47:45.115
It's your plane.

47:47.493 --> 47:49.328
It really doesn't have
to be like this.

47:49.369 --> 47:50.662
How is it supposed to be?

47:52.498 --> 47:54.750
So who's this guy?

47:57.336 --> 47:59.254
Let's just let it go, okay?

48:00.797 --> 48:03.467
I just came over here
to talk to you.

48:04.927 --> 48:07.012
You just disappeared.
I didn't even hear from you.

48:07.095 --> 48:10.682
Giselle, you were 3,000 miles away.
I tried to get in touch with you.

48:12.684 --> 48:14.686
Let's just let it go.

48:34.706 --> 48:39.378
I don't know what smells better--
this meal or your delightful perfume.

48:39.461 --> 48:41.964
Thank you. You're too kind.

48:42.047 --> 48:46.927
You know, a lot of smart women
find blind men sexy.

48:47.010 --> 48:48.178
- You know why?
- No.

48:48.262 --> 48:50.013
But I'm sure
you're about to tell me.

48:50.055 --> 48:54.434
When you lose one sense,
it makes your other senses stronger,

48:54.518 --> 48:56.895
I have more of a sensitive touch
than the average man,

48:57.020 --> 48:58.021
Please!

48:59.815 --> 49:01.275
Let me tell you about
this love I had,

49:01.400 --> 49:03.986
She was on the trampoline,
landed right in my lap.

49:04.069 --> 49:05.988
Bang! She stayed there
for 1 5 years.

49:06.071 --> 49:09.032
People crazy about me.
People love me.

49:09.116 --> 49:10.742
- You don't say.
- Don't say?

49:10.826 --> 49:12.703
I do say it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

49:12.744 --> 49:14.830
People love me.
See these fingers here?

49:14.913 --> 49:19.042
These fingers got eyes on 'em
just like 20/20 vision.

49:19.084 --> 49:21.044
You know what I mean?

49:21.086 --> 49:24.840
They... wait a minute.

49:24.923 --> 49:26.550
Move that other leg
out the way.

49:26.633 --> 49:28.093
Move that dress up, girl.

49:28.135 --> 49:31.180
Oh, boy, moist.
You just as tender as you can be.

49:31.263 --> 49:34.641
You a little frisky thing.
You got a little puddle here.

49:35.851 --> 49:37.853
Oh, you big, too.
You ain't no baby.

49:37.936 --> 49:41.273
This is wonderful.
I love freaky stuff like this.

49:41.356 --> 49:43.609
Just let yourself go.
I'm gonna let myself go, too.

49:43.692 --> 49:44.735
I'm feelin' something, too.

49:44.776 --> 49:48.405
This ain't like me.
I don't usually go this quick.

49:48.447 --> 49:49.490
I'm goin' now.

50:04.046 --> 50:06.340
Let me tell you.
Where my yack?

50:16.141 --> 50:19.978
I'm a player... player!

50:20.020 --> 50:22.105
- Hey, now.
- Oh, excuse me,

50:22.147 --> 50:24.149
No, it's cool,
I'm the attendant,

50:24.191 --> 50:25.818
You can sit this one out,
my brother.

50:25.901 --> 50:27.569
I'm just gonna wash my hands.

50:27.653 --> 50:29.238
Got me a wild woman
sittin' next to me

50:29.321 --> 50:32.991
and look what I got.
Bang! Stinky pinky.

50:33.826 --> 50:35.369
Stinky pinky, here you go.

50:35.452 --> 50:38.121
Hey, brother. I ain't washin'
that one, I'm washin' this one.

50:39.957 --> 50:43.919
She usin' cilantro.
I love that freaky shit.

50:45.671 --> 50:47.506
The only way you got
stinky pinky

50:47.589 --> 50:49.466
is if you was sittin' next to
Miss Potato Head.

50:49.508 --> 50:51.718
There's always some dude
who's a player hater

50:51.802 --> 50:52.886
'cause he ain't gettin' none.

50:56.181 --> 50:58.892
Just 'cause you blind don't mean
I won't whip your ass.

50:58.976 --> 51:01.353
Lookin' like a disco lemon.
Son of a bitch!

51:01.478 --> 51:05.065
All right, you suit-and-tie-wearin'
motherfuckers.

51:05.107 --> 51:07.651
A little green
gets you in between.

51:07.734 --> 51:10.946
The more dough,
the more they show.

51:11.029 --> 51:13.991
Now, a true player
is a payer, am I right?

51:14.032 --> 51:15.033
That's what's up.

51:15.159 --> 51:18.036
We don't park collars
at NWA--we park dollars.

51:18.120 --> 51:19.329
You heard me?

51:19.371 --> 51:23.542
If you can afford business class,
you can afford some business ass.

51:23.625 --> 51:26.170
Hey, Muggs, what's goin' on?

51:26.253 --> 51:28.338
- Where?
- Here.

51:28.380 --> 51:32.009
- Here. What is this?
- It's all good up in here, baby.

51:32.050 --> 51:34.761
We got Asian persuasion,
butter pecan freakin',

51:34.845 --> 51:35.888
chocolate deluxe.

51:35.971 --> 51:38.140
I got it all
in my little shopping mall.

51:38.223 --> 51:40.017
What is it you're not gettin'?

51:40.058 --> 51:44.188
First gamblin', now this?
It's illegal, man.

51:44.271 --> 51:45.772
You with the FAA, nigga?

51:45.898 --> 51:47.816
- No. What are you talkin' about?
- Ain't no rules in the air.

51:47.900 --> 51:49.818
Listen to me.
That's not the point, man.

51:49.902 --> 51:53.030
It's a family airline.
You got ladies up in here?

51:53.071 --> 51:54.072
I sure do!

51:55.908 --> 51:58.785
Listen to me.
We not in the 'hood no more.

51:58.869 --> 51:59.953
Hey, Nashawn.

52:00.078 --> 52:02.789
Hey! What's this about?

52:02.831 --> 52:04.458
The girls just wanted
to show their appreciation

52:04.541 --> 52:06.502
for everything you've done.

52:06.585 --> 52:07.920
If you stick around for a minute.

52:08.003 --> 52:10.756
I'm sure it'd make the ladies
very, very happy.

52:10.839 --> 52:11.924
Start with this.

52:13.175 --> 52:14.927
Just like that?

52:15.010 --> 52:16.011
You're so sexy.

52:16.094 --> 52:18.096
Whoa! Slow down!

52:19.264 --> 52:20.349
Back up.

52:20.432 --> 52:23.894
Oh, my God!
Hey, move, devil.

52:23.977 --> 52:25.187
Get it together
and get it fast.

52:25.270 --> 52:26.688
You got to get off the pole.

52:26.772 --> 52:29.483
Hey, baby, watch your step.
Hey.

52:30.943 --> 52:32.528
I guess there are some things
you can commit to.

52:32.611 --> 52:34.822
You talkin' 'bout this?

52:36.073 --> 52:37.699
I'm just doin' my job,
that's all.

52:37.783 --> 52:39.243
Yeah, it looks like
you're a workaholic.

52:40.369 --> 52:42.663
And here I was thinkin' I was
too hard on you before.

52:45.040 --> 52:46.583
Guess you're the man now.

52:50.295 --> 52:51.880
Wait, Giselle.

52:55.634 --> 52:57.386
What the fuck am I doin'?!

53:02.724 --> 53:04.101
You ready for this?

53:04.142 --> 53:05.143
- Yeah.
- You ready?

53:05.227 --> 53:06.228
Oh, yeah, daddy.

53:06.311 --> 53:07.688
- You sure?
- Wait.

53:07.771 --> 53:09.356
Don't fight the feelin', baby.

53:12.776 --> 53:14.736
What the hell is you doin'
in here?

53:14.820 --> 53:17.406
That's the problem with
you young cats. You talk too much.

53:17.489 --> 53:18.907
- A woman like that...
- You do talk a lot.

53:18.991 --> 53:20.701
...wants a man of action.

53:21.451 --> 53:24.955
I was wonderin' if you can
help my friend Ben here.

53:25.038 --> 53:26.999
He needs you to take him
back to his seat.

53:27.040 --> 53:29.459
Yeah, Ben, I believe I know
where this cat is sittin'.

53:30.711 --> 53:33.422
Dig this here.
You don't need a lot of space.

53:33.505 --> 53:35.382
Superman changed
in a phone booth.

53:35.465 --> 53:39.052
Hey, don't be...
man, don't be touchin'...

53:39.136 --> 53:40.512
Tidy Bowl man.

53:40.554 --> 53:41.972
We gonna need this right here.

53:46.018 --> 53:48.479
- Ready for this?
- Oh, yeah.

53:48.562 --> 53:50.314
Hey, what the hell is this?

53:50.397 --> 53:51.857
I seen this on an episode
of "Real Sex".

53:51.899 --> 53:53.942
- You sure about this?
- Trust me.

53:54.026 --> 53:55.777
All you gotta do
is have a safety word.

53:55.861 --> 53:56.862
You got one?

53:56.945 --> 53:58.489
Yeah, when I say.
"Get off me, you crazy bitch",

53:58.572 --> 53:59.781
you stop chokin' me.

54:01.533 --> 54:02.576
Ow! Shit!

54:05.204 --> 54:06.663
Actually, I wish you'd stop
smackin' me.

54:06.705 --> 54:07.748
You like it.

54:07.873 --> 54:09.791
- It's tight.
- It's supposed to be tight.

54:09.875 --> 54:10.918
That's why you buy me
the good shit.

54:11.001 --> 54:13.212
The belt is too damn tight!

54:13.295 --> 54:17.299
Stop your bitch-ass complainin'
and give me what you promised.

54:19.510 --> 54:21.261
I can't feel my toes!

54:21.345 --> 54:23.764
I can't feel your dick,
but I ain't complainin'.

54:23.847 --> 54:27.059
D.J., please, don't stop.
Five more seconds.

54:37.194 --> 54:40.823
Cheese, eggs, grits, chilies,
yams, sunflower seeds.

54:42.699 --> 54:45.452
No. No!

54:45.536 --> 54:46.537
No?

54:46.620 --> 54:49.206
Man, this is not the way
it happened on "Real Sex".

54:49.289 --> 54:51.250
This is some real bullshit.

54:51.333 --> 54:52.626
It was probably the turbulence

54:52.709 --> 54:56.380
and all the excituration
of the moment, 'cause I used--

54:56.421 --> 54:59.675
You see that, David.
Did you see that, David?

54:59.758 --> 55:01.426
Why you always got to go--

55:01.552 --> 55:03.720
I need to spank you
with the bad...

55:03.929 --> 55:05.430
I'm gonna punish him.

55:06.390 --> 55:09.393
This motherfuckin' autopilot shit
is cool as hell, man.

55:09.476 --> 55:11.937
Just kick back
and ride and glide.

55:12.020 --> 55:15.566
Relax, motherfucker.
I should be captain of this plane.

55:15.691 --> 55:18.652
Ten years with Chuku Airlines.

55:18.735 --> 55:21.905
Chuku Airlines, where we treat you
with a lot of respect.

55:21.947 --> 55:23.824
This motherfucker.

55:23.907 --> 55:26.034
Now I'm here with this nigga.

55:27.286 --> 55:30.539
Nigga, shut the fuck up with that
African mumbo-jumbo bullshit.

55:30.622 --> 55:33.000
I hear you over there
with that Chuku Airlines shit.

55:33.083 --> 55:35.127
You with NWA Airlines,
I'm the captain.

55:35.210 --> 55:37.254
- I don't care.
- Real niggas drive real shit.

55:37.337 --> 55:38.338
I should kill you.

55:39.965 --> 55:41.842
We have a birthday girl,
Captain.

55:41.925 --> 55:43.218
This is Heather Hunkee.

55:43.302 --> 55:45.679
She wanted to see
our cockpit.

55:45.804 --> 55:47.264
How old are you, Heather?

55:47.306 --> 55:48.307
I just turned 18.

55:48.432 --> 55:50.851
Is that right? Oh, boy.

55:50.934 --> 55:53.145
Attention, all players.

55:53.228 --> 55:56.231
The upper deck will be open
for your enjoyment.

55:56.315 --> 55:59.443
We have a passenger
who just turned 18 years old.

55:59.526 --> 56:00.944
Her name is Heather Hunkee.

56:01.028 --> 56:05.032
She is one cute little hottie
with a whole lotta body.

56:05.073 --> 56:06.783
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

56:06.825 --> 56:10.162
She'll be upstairs, so all players
come up and keep her company.

56:10.204 --> 56:13.832
No!

56:21.423 --> 56:24.301
Hey, Virgie, how are you?
Good to see you.

56:24.343 --> 56:25.886
Yeah, I know. It's hot, right?

56:26.011 --> 56:27.888
This is hot.

56:27.971 --> 56:30.432
Let me take you to the bar.
Give me your jacket, girl.

56:34.186 --> 56:36.897
Big Boy!

56:36.980 --> 56:38.690
All my pimps, players,
and hustlers--

56:38.774 --> 56:41.735
y'all ready to set this motherfucker
off, West Coast style?

56:41.819 --> 56:43.987
As you see,
we up in the clouds.

56:44.029 --> 56:46.365
Got a gang of lovely ladies
out there on the dance floor

56:46.448 --> 56:49.159
ready to go ahead and shake
that ass and get they freak on.

56:49.201 --> 56:51.161
To my fellas out there
who ain't got no game--

56:51.245 --> 56:52.496
yeah, I'm talkin' to you.

56:52.621 --> 56:55.040
Don't even trip on it,
'cause we ain't goin' nowhere.

56:55.082 --> 56:58.001
We locked in this bitch for
four more hours till we touch down,

56:58.043 --> 57:00.212
so you might as well go ahead
and get your swerve on.

57:00.337 --> 57:04.007
- Marshall, good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

57:04.049 --> 57:06.385
This is Heather.
She's turnin' 18 today.

57:06.468 --> 57:07.636
Happy birthday.

57:07.719 --> 57:10.055
- Thank you.
- Captain Mack is buyin' her

57:10.138 --> 57:11.306
her first drink.

57:11.390 --> 57:12.808
What can I get for you?

57:12.891 --> 57:14.560
Surprise me.

57:14.643 --> 57:16.061
I got just what you need.

57:17.312 --> 57:19.398
Girl, he is cute!

57:19.481 --> 57:20.691
I know. He's a looker.

57:22.526 --> 57:23.944
He'll hook you up.

57:31.827 --> 57:35.038
Cool! All right, have a good time.
I gotta go back downstairs.

57:35.080 --> 57:36.331
Keep an eye on her.

57:36.415 --> 57:37.833
Oh, I will.

57:37.916 --> 57:39.543
Not that kind of eye.

57:39.585 --> 57:40.961
It's Big Boy.

57:41.044 --> 57:42.212
What's goin' down, y'all?

57:42.296 --> 57:44.173
We gonna keep
this motherfucker crackin'

57:44.256 --> 57:46.466
until everybody in here
pass the fuck out.

57:51.513 --> 57:53.724
Yeah, this is my joint
right here.

58:07.446 --> 58:10.616
- Who'd you come here with?
- Don't worry about that.

58:10.699 --> 58:13.118
- Please, Captain, I just--
- Hey, nigga!

58:13.202 --> 58:14.995
What part of "you ain't flyin'
this motherfuckin' plane"

58:15.078 --> 58:16.622
don't you understand?

58:16.705 --> 58:18.749
Sit back and enjoy the ride,
Idi Amin.

58:23.879 --> 58:26.131
What are you doing?
You fool!

58:26.215 --> 58:28.842
Any motherfuckin' dry ass
mushrooms of yours

58:28.926 --> 58:30.886
ain't gettin' me high
no motherfuckin' way.

58:30.969 --> 58:33.013
You need to fuck with the white boys.
They shit potent.

58:33.138 --> 58:34.389
White boys, American shit.

58:34.473 --> 58:36.433
This is African mushrooms,
very dangerous.

58:36.475 --> 58:37.476
They can kill you!

58:37.601 --> 58:40.687
You ate 15 of them!
These are topical, for the skin.

58:40.771 --> 58:43.690
I crush them up,
and I put them...

58:46.109 --> 58:47.319
... for my itching.

58:47.402 --> 58:49.279
Motherfucker, you got crabs?!

58:51.156 --> 58:54.326
This man got crabs. You ain't
sittin' in the pilot's seat for sure.

58:56.078 --> 58:57.996
Ha ha, keep laughing.
It's not funny.

58:58.914 --> 59:01.124
African crab is very aggressive.

59:02.292 --> 59:03.460
They hunt us.

59:04.545 --> 59:06.964
They can kill you.

59:07.005 --> 59:10.008
That motherfucker
is crazy as fuck, man.

59:10.133 --> 59:12.010
They dangerous,
and they kill you.

59:15.013 --> 59:16.765
Fuck!

59:16.849 --> 59:18.475
That Gaeman!

59:21.603 --> 59:22.646
Excuse me.

59:22.729 --> 59:25.482
Motherfucker,
did you just touch me?

59:25.566 --> 59:27.025
Yeah, I wanna get up
in the club.

59:27.109 --> 59:29.528
- You on the list?
- What list?

59:29.570 --> 59:31.405
The goddamn guest list.

59:31.488 --> 59:33.073
- Are you on it?
- I don't know.

59:33.157 --> 59:35.159
You don't know?
What's your name?

59:35.200 --> 59:36.618
Elvis Hunkee.

59:37.953 --> 59:40.205
I wouldn't even have wrote
no shit down like that, homey.

59:40.330 --> 59:42.499
Maybe it's under The King,

59:42.583 --> 59:44.626
'cause my friends,
they call me "The King".

59:44.710 --> 59:45.711
It's my nickname.

59:45.836 --> 59:48.213
I ain't your friend,
and you ain't no king, motherfucker.

59:48.255 --> 59:49.715
Right.

59:49.798 --> 59:52.968
Move! I'm talkin' to you.

59:53.051 --> 59:54.761
What's up? Go right in.

01:00:00.893 --> 01:00:03.520
All right, put 'em up.

01:00:03.562 --> 01:00:04.938
It's go time.

01:00:05.022 --> 01:00:07.483
It's definitely go time,
motherfucker.

01:00:07.566 --> 01:00:09.902
You about to get
the best damn ass-whippin'.

01:00:09.985 --> 01:00:12.696
I hope the little bitch
you're lookin' for is worth dyin' for.

01:00:12.821 --> 01:00:15.157
She is, 'cause that little bitch
is my daughter.

01:00:17.743 --> 01:00:18.744
Your daughter?

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:23.832
Why didn't you say
that shit, man?

01:00:23.916 --> 01:00:25.751
I got five daughters, man.

01:00:25.792 --> 01:00:29.379
The little one, Trina,
every time I see her.

01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:33.342
she just runs into my arms,
like, "Daddy. Daddy!"

01:00:33.425 --> 01:00:35.344
We have little tea parties
and shit.

01:00:35.427 --> 01:00:37.596
The little cups, and I put
the little hat on.

01:00:37.679 --> 01:00:41.183
Little table, man.
It was so beautiful.

01:00:41.266 --> 01:00:42.935
My heart would, like, explode.

01:00:43.018 --> 01:00:46.063
Yeah, I need to go upstairs.

01:00:46.188 --> 01:00:48.649
- I miss my babies.
- I miss mine, too. She's upstairs.

01:00:48.774 --> 01:00:51.193
I never see them.
I'm always busy securin' shit.

01:00:51.276 --> 01:00:53.529
- Honest living.
- I never see 'em, dawg.

01:00:53.612 --> 01:00:55.989
Secure your shit.

01:00:57.825 --> 01:01:00.285
Secure your shit.
Go get your girl, man.

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:01.787
Go get your little girl.

01:01:02.955 --> 01:01:04.456
Take care of your family, man!

01:01:07.459 --> 01:01:08.585
Who's on the list?

01:01:08.627 --> 01:01:11.380
Yo, Captain. I got to go
drain the monster.

01:01:11.463 --> 01:01:13.173
What the hell's taking
Gay-man so long?

01:01:13.257 --> 01:01:14.967
I don't know, I ain't his mama.

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:16.760
Matter of fact,
why don't you page him

01:01:16.802 --> 01:01:19.638
and tell him to bring
his bitch ass up here 911.

01:01:21.265 --> 01:01:22.391
Attention, Gay-man.

01:01:22.474 --> 01:01:25.310
<i>Attention, Gay-man,
I have to go drain the monster.</i>

01:01:25.394 --> 01:01:27.688
<i>Return to the cockpit
immediately.</i>

01:01:46.832 --> 01:01:49.668
Man, I wouldn't answer
that shit if I was you, homey.

01:01:50.669 --> 01:01:52.838
Shake it up real fast
then stop

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.551
Shake it up real fast
then drop

01:01:59.887 --> 01:02:02.222
Shawty crunk on the floor
wide open

01:02:02.347 --> 01:02:04.766
Skeet so much,
they call her Billy Ocean

01:02:04.808 --> 01:02:06.768
Roll like a 18-wheeler

01:02:06.852 --> 01:02:09.480
That... fine,
but this... killer

01:02:09.521 --> 01:02:11.398
Leakin', she soakin' wet

01:02:13.734 --> 01:02:16.904
- Muggsy, what are you doin'?
- Cut!

01:02:19.406 --> 01:02:20.532
Who the hell said cut?

01:02:20.616 --> 01:02:25.162
Yeah. Who the hell said cut?
The director says cut. Damn!

01:02:25.245 --> 01:02:26.872
Look, Nashawn.
I already know, dawg.

01:02:26.997 --> 01:02:29.666
Come here.
Is that the Ying Yang Twins?

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:31.502
Yeah.

01:02:31.585 --> 01:02:33.504
Watch out.
Ying Yang Twins!

01:02:33.545 --> 01:02:34.713
What's up, baby?

01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:38.592
Don't drink gasoline.
We got a bar.

01:02:38.675 --> 01:02:40.677
I had a gold tooth.
I shoulda kept it for this.

01:02:40.761 --> 01:02:41.762
Why y'all stop rollin'?

01:02:41.845 --> 01:02:42.846
'Cause you came in.

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:44.890
No, don't stop on account of me,
I'm the owner.

01:02:44.932 --> 01:02:47.392
Nashawn Wade--that's me.
I'm the boss of this.

01:02:47.476 --> 01:02:49.645
- Hey, roll camera!
- Who said roll camera?

01:02:49.728 --> 01:02:52.022
I say roll camera.

01:02:52.064 --> 01:02:53.941
- That's my job.
- That's his job.

01:02:54.024 --> 01:02:57.277
Chris, I'm tellin' ya, we need
more sexy in this video.

01:02:57.361 --> 01:02:58.737
Let's go, Tamika.
Get in there.

01:03:03.742 --> 01:03:04.827
This cool?

01:03:09.498 --> 01:03:12.417
- Yes, sir.
- Tamika, let's get in there.

01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:14.127
Get on in there, girl.

01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:16.171
Yo, Chris, I'm tellin' ya, man.

01:03:16.255 --> 01:03:18.423
We need more ass in this video,
and it'd be off the hook.

01:03:19.424 --> 01:03:21.593
Yo, Muggsy, who is this kid?

01:03:21.677 --> 01:03:23.095
Roll camera.

01:03:30.727 --> 01:03:33.230
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

01:03:39.278 --> 01:03:42.948
Lil' John back there.
Shake it like a salt shaker!

01:03:43.031 --> 01:03:45.784
Can I get a glass of Hypno
with some ice, please?

01:03:45.868 --> 01:03:48.287
- Coming right up.
- What you doin' by yourself?

01:03:48.328 --> 01:03:50.789
- Go have a good time.
- No, thanks.

01:03:50.831 --> 01:03:54.543
- You okay?
- No.

01:03:54.626 --> 01:03:56.712
So what's goin' on?

01:03:56.795 --> 01:04:00.465
My son Billy--he doesn't
want to be anything like me.

01:04:00.591 --> 01:04:02.259
He says I got no flavor.

01:04:02.301 --> 01:04:05.053
My daughter Heather--
she's growin' up so fast.

01:04:05.137 --> 01:04:08.765
It seems like yesterday
I was teachin' her to ride a bike.

01:04:08.891 --> 01:04:10.309
Now she's out there...

01:04:11.685 --> 01:04:12.769
Hey, what is tea-bagging?

01:04:15.481 --> 01:04:16.732
That's the shit!

01:04:16.815 --> 01:04:19.776
That's where you take your balls
and dip 'em in a freak mouth.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.070
you keep goin'
up and down like...

01:04:23.947 --> 01:04:28.076
- Then you dip, right.
- I got it. Thank you.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.329
I got a little carried away.

01:04:30.412 --> 01:04:33.790
Gettin' back on the subject--
you raise your kids right,

01:04:33.832 --> 01:04:35.667
eventually they gonna
wanna move on

01:04:35.751 --> 01:04:37.044
and find they own path.

01:04:37.169 --> 01:04:41.173
You're probably right.
You're a lucky man, Nashawn.

01:04:41.298 --> 01:04:42.799
I wouldn't say that.

01:04:42.883 --> 01:04:45.260
It took me gettin' everything
I ever wanted

01:04:45.344 --> 01:04:47.012
to realize I lost
the best thing I ever had.

01:04:47.095 --> 01:04:48.639
What was her name?

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.892
- Giselle.
- That's a beautiful name.

01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:53.435
Bet she's beautiful.

01:04:53.519 --> 01:04:56.313
Very. Very!

01:04:56.355 --> 01:04:57.815
Still love her?

01:04:57.856 --> 01:04:59.358
Course I do.

01:04:59.399 --> 01:05:01.026
Then go do somethin'
about it.

01:05:01.151 --> 01:05:02.861
Listen, when I met
my Barbara.

01:05:02.903 --> 01:05:05.989
I knew that moment I'd move
heaven and earth to be with her.

01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:07.991
I knew that she was worth it.

01:05:08.033 --> 01:05:10.077
So you happy now?

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.787
Not really.

01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:15.374
Last time I saw her,
she was with this tall model type.

01:05:16.416 --> 01:05:18.168
A real handsome black guy?

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:19.211
Yeah.

01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:20.462
Sittin' in low class?

01:05:20.546 --> 01:05:21.839
Yeah.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.465
Got a dick like a fire hose?

01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:25.384
Yeah.

01:05:25.467 --> 01:05:27.928
Yeah, you lost her.

01:05:30.055 --> 01:05:32.432
- Can he get another one?
- Double.

01:05:32.516 --> 01:05:34.393
Have you talked to her?

01:05:34.476 --> 01:05:36.562
She can't talk.
She must have vocal cord damage.

01:05:36.645 --> 01:05:37.646
I can believe it.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:44.111
Man, if my baby mama page me
one more time, I swear to God...

01:05:44.236 --> 01:05:46.196
What she want?

01:05:46.238 --> 01:05:48.824
This motherfuckin' bitch wants
some more child support money

01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:50.075
'cause she heard I got this job.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.952
<i>I can't believe these hos
nowadays.</i>

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:54.454
<i>She extortin' you?
That's messed up, man.</i>

01:05:54.538 --> 01:05:56.206
<i>But you know what?</i>

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:58.500
<i>If I crash this motherfucker
into a mountain right now,</i>

01:05:58.584 --> 01:06:00.127
<i>the bitch can't get
shit from me.</i>

01:06:00.252 --> 01:06:01.211
Watch this.

01:06:06.633 --> 01:06:08.343
Oh, shit!

01:06:08.427 --> 01:06:13.807
Shit, my nigga!
Oh, shit! Hold on, cuz!

01:06:13.891 --> 01:06:16.185
- Oh, shit!
- Here we go.

01:06:21.356 --> 01:06:23.275
That shit was funny as hell.

01:06:23.358 --> 01:06:25.360
I know they trippin'
off this shit in the back.

01:06:29.072 --> 01:06:32.117
You fuckin' high, dawg.
You startin' to scare me now.

01:06:34.578 --> 01:06:35.746
Here ya go.

01:06:35.787 --> 01:06:38.540
I'm gonna bounce before
Gay-dude and Riggs come back.

01:06:38.624 --> 01:06:40.584
All right, my nigga.

01:06:43.629 --> 01:06:49.426
I'm put this bitch on autopilot
so I can enjoy myself.

01:06:55.224 --> 01:06:57.309
Captain Mack need to kick back

01:06:57.434 --> 01:07:00.479
and enjoy this
motherfuckin' situation.

01:07:00.604 --> 01:07:03.732
Oh, shit.
Last mushroom.

01:07:03.774 --> 01:07:05.859
Might as well go on
and take this to the head.

01:07:08.862 --> 01:07:12.658
Dry-ass mushroom,
African motherfucker.

01:07:33.762 --> 01:07:34.805
Here you are, sir.

01:07:39.434 --> 01:07:42.646
Oh, hey, that's my dad.
I need to talk to him.

01:07:44.982 --> 01:07:45.983
Hi, Daddy.

01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:48.277
Happy birthday, Heather.

01:07:49.862 --> 01:07:51.155
You mad at me?

01:07:51.196 --> 01:07:55.659
No, Actually, I'm just glad to hear
you call me daddy for a change,

01:07:55.701 --> 01:07:56.827
It's been a while,

01:07:56.869 --> 01:07:58.996
Usually it's shithead or asshole
or something,

01:07:59.079 --> 01:08:01.957
I'm sorry. It's just
I hate that you're with Boobra.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.502
Barbara... and I
are not together anymore.

01:08:05.586 --> 01:08:08.547
I'm still upset that
you and Mom aren't together.

01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:10.674
I'm sorry about that, honey.

01:08:11.717 --> 01:08:14.219
But your mom's
with Dorothy now.

01:08:15.554 --> 01:08:17.096
I'd like to be with your mom.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.640
Hell, I'd love to be
with your mom and Dorothy.

01:08:19.725 --> 01:08:21.518
But that's not important.

01:08:21.602 --> 01:08:23.812
What's important is that you know
that I'm your dad,

01:08:23.895 --> 01:08:26.732
and whether you're 18 or 48 or 88,
I'm gonna still protect you

01:08:26.773 --> 01:08:27.816
because I love you.

01:08:29.693 --> 01:08:30.944
I love you, too, Daddy.

01:08:32.404 --> 01:08:34.490
I'll always be your little girl.

01:08:34.573 --> 01:08:35.573
Right.

01:08:35.657 --> 01:08:36.950
I will.

01:08:37.033 --> 01:08:38.493
What about
all that stuff tonight?

01:08:38.577 --> 01:08:40.746
Oh, don't worry.
I didn't do anything.

01:08:40.828 --> 01:08:42.288
Really?

01:08:42.413 --> 01:08:44.124
I was just saying stuff
to get you mad.

01:08:45.834 --> 01:08:48.337
I don't even know
what half that stuff is.

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:51.256
What's tea-bagging anyway?

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.966
That's when you
get down on top...

01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:54.384
Dad!

01:08:54.426 --> 01:08:57.513
Apparently, it's the shit.
Come here.

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.228
So can I have
another blow job?

01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:06.145
It's a drink.

01:09:08.607 --> 01:09:10.943
It's cool.

01:09:11.026 --> 01:09:14.154
Look, baby. I'm sorry,
and I wants to make it up to you.

01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:19.743
Don't get it started because you
know you're not gonna finish.

01:09:19.785 --> 01:09:23.455
Why you bringin' up old shit?
Let me see them tits!

01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:30.127
Okay, okay! What's the plan?

01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:34.591
Hold on one second.
I'm fixin' to be right back.

01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:42.307
Good evening, Cap.
Is it cool if I come in?

01:09:50.274 --> 01:09:52.442
This is tight up in here, dawg.

01:09:52.526 --> 01:09:54.528
I'm not gonna
beat around the bush, man.

01:09:54.611 --> 01:09:56.155
I'll get straight to the point.

01:09:56.238 --> 01:09:59.950
Me and my girl--we overly ambitious
members of the mile-high club.

01:10:00.033 --> 01:10:03.912
I was wondering if you would
let us come in here,

01:10:03.996 --> 01:10:07.207
and, we could, like, do it.

01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:09.209
All right, cool.

01:10:09.293 --> 01:10:10.294
I'm fixin' to get her.

01:10:10.377 --> 01:10:12.963
You probably gonna see
her titties and everything, man.

01:10:13.088 --> 01:10:14.548
I'll be right back, dawg.

01:10:25.476 --> 01:10:27.811
Hey, this is my girl.

01:10:28.896 --> 01:10:29.980
Hi, Captain.

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:33.317
I know you got stuff to do,

01:10:33.358 --> 01:10:35.402
so we just gonna
do our thing, man.

01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:39.490
Yeah, it's cool.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.618
Okay, okay.

01:10:42.701 --> 01:10:47.164
No, no.
Ain't that my game.

01:10:53.754 --> 01:10:57.382
Ooh, yeah.
I like the way you doin' that.

01:10:57.466 --> 01:10:58.592
Ooh, work it, daddy.

01:10:58.675 --> 01:11:02.304
I'm tryin', but it's like
a sauna down here,

01:11:02.387 --> 01:11:03.388
It's like a fire,,,

01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:06.892
- How's that?
- Oh, it's good, daddy.

01:11:06.934 --> 01:11:08.685
You the king.

01:11:09.978 --> 01:11:11.980
Tastes like chocolate puddin'.

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:16.235
Gots to have you right now.

01:11:16.318 --> 01:11:18.862
- Got to have you right now, girl!
- Nasty fool!

01:11:30.582 --> 01:11:33.669
Oh, shit. That nigga dead!
He dead!

01:11:35.963 --> 01:11:37.422
Get your ass off me!

01:11:37.506 --> 01:11:40.259
He's dead! This nigga's dead!

01:11:40.342 --> 01:11:41.468
This nigga's dead!

01:11:45.389 --> 01:11:46.765
The captain is dead!

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:49.268
Pork chop grease.

01:11:50.644 --> 01:11:53.730
I'll take care of it.
The captain's dead!

01:11:56.984 --> 01:11:59.194
That's our motto:
we fly, we party, we land.

01:11:59.278 --> 01:12:00.904
That's what we tryin'
to do, man.

01:12:00.988 --> 01:12:02.739
Nashawn, we gotta talk.

01:12:02.781 --> 01:12:04.449
I want to talk to you, too.

01:12:05.576 --> 01:12:06.743
The captain is dead.

01:12:06.785 --> 01:12:08.328
Dead?

01:12:09.413 --> 01:12:11.707
Wait a minute.
Are we talkin' Tupac dead.

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:13.709
Iike maybe he is
or maybe he isn't,

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:16.461
or Wilt Chamberlain dead, like
he ain't checkin' back in the game?

01:12:16.545 --> 01:12:18.130
Dead like he can't
fly this plane, dead.

01:12:19.756 --> 01:12:21.133
People are freakin' out.

01:12:24.303 --> 01:12:27.306
It's Muggsy
hirin' these prison pilots.

01:12:27.347 --> 01:12:29.516
You know what.
That's what we got a copilot for.

01:12:29.641 --> 01:12:32.060
All we gotta do is find Gaeman,
because I hired him.

01:12:32.144 --> 01:12:34.104
He's a professional,
and we should be cool.

01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:38.192
Yes, counterclockwise.
Move your ass, baby.

01:12:38.275 --> 01:12:40.736
Don't forget to squeeze
my nipple like a cow.

01:12:41.987 --> 01:12:45.616
Would you like to see
my African walking stick?

01:12:45.657 --> 01:12:47.409
Hey, hey, Gaeman.

01:12:47.493 --> 01:12:51.121
Oh, my God. Move over!
How are you, sir?

01:12:51.163 --> 01:12:56.001
I was taking a bath, I was dirty.
You are clean now, ladies.

01:12:56.084 --> 01:12:59.296
I got an emergency,
I need you to fly the plane.

01:12:59.379 --> 01:13:01.006
The plane?

01:13:01.131 --> 01:13:02.090
Yeah.

01:13:02.216 --> 01:13:04.510
- Me? Fly the plane?
- Yes.

01:13:04.593 --> 01:13:06.512
Oh, my God!
I get to fly.

01:13:06.553 --> 01:13:07.513
They will have a parade!

01:13:07.638 --> 01:13:10.057
Go, Gaeman!
Move out the way!

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:13.143
Move, you bitches!
I have to fly the plane.

01:13:13.185 --> 01:13:14.812
What's wrong with you?

01:13:16.605 --> 01:13:17.689
Oh, shit!

01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:20.609
He fell hard.

01:13:20.692 --> 01:13:22.402
Gaeman!

01:13:27.241 --> 01:13:28.700
God damn!

01:13:29.618 --> 01:13:32.162
What the hell am l
supposed to do now?

01:13:32.287 --> 01:13:35.749
You're gonna find some way
to land this plane.

01:13:35.874 --> 01:13:37.876
Meet me in the cockpit, okay?

01:13:40.712 --> 01:13:43.048
- Meet you?
- In the cockpit.

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:56.186
I got one more left.

01:13:59.898 --> 01:14:02.609
Here you go. You gotta pull
one of these damn cords.

01:14:02.734 --> 01:14:04.319
I don't want this shit, man.

01:14:04.403 --> 01:14:06.071
I'm responsible
for these people.

01:14:06.196 --> 01:14:07.614
I gotta try something.

01:14:07.698 --> 01:14:09.533
Fuck them.
What are you, sick?

01:14:09.616 --> 01:14:12.870
I know you, all right?
You can't even ride a bike.

01:14:12.953 --> 01:14:14.413
How do you expect
to land this thing?

01:14:14.538 --> 01:14:15.831
It don't even--

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:18.917
It don't even matter.

01:14:19.001 --> 01:14:20.544
I'm not runnin' out
like I always do.

01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:23.088
I'm gonna face this shit.
If you wanna go, go.

01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:27.050
If you goin', go.
You gotta pull this one.

01:14:27.134 --> 01:14:29.386
Hey, don't be grabbin' my cord.

01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:32.389
You gonna make my chute
ejaculate prematurely,

01:14:37.019 --> 01:14:39.521
Baby, watch your head.
Don't let that touch you.

01:14:39.605 --> 01:14:43.984
- I got a dead pilot, man.
- Just go. God damn!

01:14:44.067 --> 01:14:46.904
Oh, my God!
Not like this.

01:14:51.283 --> 01:14:54.703
Listen, Giselle...
in case something happens,

01:14:54.786 --> 01:14:56.538
there's something I need
to get off my chest.

01:14:56.622 --> 01:14:58.665
That night
when you and I broke up.

01:14:58.749 --> 01:15:00.292
I was on your porch.

01:15:00.417 --> 01:15:04.671
I overheard you and your father
arguing about college.

01:15:04.713 --> 01:15:07.466
What do you mean,
you're not goin' away to college?

01:15:07.549 --> 01:15:10.219
It's too far, I want to stay here
where Nashawn is.

01:15:10.302 --> 01:15:13.764
You gotta go, I been waitin'
18 years for this day

01:15:13.889 --> 01:15:15.224
to have the house to myself.

01:15:15.307 --> 01:15:17.518
I'm not going.

01:15:17.601 --> 01:15:21.063
You always dreamed
of going to NYU.

01:15:22.147 --> 01:15:24.525
Now they're offering you
a full scholarship.

01:15:24.608 --> 01:15:26.151
You tellin' me you're not goin'

01:15:26.235 --> 01:15:28.654
because of some little
poop butt ass nigga

01:15:28.737 --> 01:15:30.155
who can't even keep a job!

01:15:30.239 --> 01:15:33.742
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I can't leave Nashawn.

01:15:33.826 --> 01:15:35.953
I love him and he loves me.

01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:38.997
You are going to college.
You're not messin' up my plans.

01:15:39.081 --> 01:15:42.167
<i>I didn't want you to throw
all that away because of me.</i>

01:15:42.251 --> 01:15:44.253
I can get $200 a month
for that room.

01:15:44.336 --> 01:15:46.797
<i>I just want you to know
that I'm sorry, Giselle.</i>

01:15:46.922 --> 01:15:49.633
<i>- Hey, baby.
- I'm so sorry for hurting you.</i>

01:15:50.592 --> 01:15:53.053
Leaving you was the biggest
mistake of my life.

01:15:54.721 --> 01:15:55.806
For what it's worth...

01:15:58.725 --> 01:16:00.936
I never stopped loving you.

01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:12.156
You better get in there.
You got a plane to land.

01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:17.077
Yeah.

01:16:22.207 --> 01:16:26.128
Cool. I'm cool. I got it.
I got it right now.

01:16:28.463 --> 01:16:29.673
Mayday.

01:16:33.343 --> 01:16:35.095
SOS.

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:37.097
I said SOS.

01:16:42.978 --> 01:16:44.062
Come down, selecta.

01:16:44.146 --> 01:16:45.230
- Nashawn!
- What?

01:16:45.314 --> 01:16:47.149
Are you gonna cut a demo
or radio in?

01:16:47.232 --> 01:16:48.692
I don't know what to say.

01:16:48.775 --> 01:16:52.029
I got something.
Hello? This is Nashawn Wade,

01:16:52.154 --> 01:16:54.281
owner of NWA Airlines.

01:16:55.324 --> 01:16:56.992
Yes, sir, the black one.

01:16:57.075 --> 01:16:58.869
No, don't hang up. Hello?

01:16:58.911 --> 01:17:01.246
Can you please help us?
We got a situation here.

01:17:01.371 --> 01:17:05.083
My pilot died, and I got people
on the back of my plane

01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:07.711
asking for help and--hello?

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:13.550
They put me on hold.

01:17:13.592 --> 01:17:17.721
<i>Due to the high number of calls,
your estimated wait time</i>

01:17:17.805 --> 01:17:19.890
<i>- is 45 minutes.
- What are you doing here?</i>

01:17:19.932 --> 01:17:21.266
We family, man.

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:24.394
We was in this from the beginning,
we gonna ride this out to the end.

01:17:24.478 --> 01:17:25.896
That's my nigga, man.

01:17:27.773 --> 01:17:30.859
Look at my watch.
What's up, G?

01:17:30.943 --> 01:17:33.946
Excuse me. I represent three
of the four white people on board.

01:17:34.029 --> 01:17:36.865
I want to tell you fellas
we are behind you 100%.

01:17:37.991 --> 01:17:39.576
What? Hunkee, please.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.787
I'm just here to find
the little black box

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:44.122
so I can wrap
my big, black ass around it.

01:17:44.206 --> 01:17:47.209
If I have to ride that tiny,
indestructible motherfucker

01:17:47.292 --> 01:17:48.836
30,000 feet to safety,

01:17:48.919 --> 01:17:51.839
trust you'll hear bitch screamin'.
"Hi ho, Silver".

01:17:51.922 --> 01:17:53.549
Where's the box?

01:17:53.632 --> 01:17:56.635
I really want to thank y'all
for giving me all this confidence.

01:17:56.718 --> 01:17:59.638
- I really feel it, I do.
- You're welcome.

01:17:59.721 --> 01:18:01.431
Somebody knows
how to land this plane,

01:18:01.515 --> 01:18:02.933
this would be
the time to speak.

01:18:02.975 --> 01:18:05.227
I saw a show on
the Discovery channel,

01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:07.020
but that was about motorcycles.

01:18:17.239 --> 01:18:18.782
Take control of the plane.

01:18:18.824 --> 01:18:19.825
What?

01:18:19.908 --> 01:18:22.703
You have to disengage
the autopilot.

01:18:22.786 --> 01:18:23.829
How do you know that?

01:18:23.912 --> 01:18:26.206
I used to date this pilot,

01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:29.168
and we would make love
in the cockpit.

01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:34.214
You haven't had an orgasm
until you've had it during descent.

01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:37.176
Bitch, can you land this plane?

01:18:37.259 --> 01:18:39.803
Show me where it is, Blanca.
What is it?

01:18:40.929 --> 01:18:42.723
I don't remember.

01:18:42.806 --> 01:18:43.974
That's what I told you...

01:18:44.057 --> 01:18:45.350
I need you to go
to the back then.

01:18:45.434 --> 01:18:46.643
No, hold on.

01:18:46.727 --> 01:18:48.812
Last time I was here...

01:18:57.196 --> 01:18:58.572
Here, here!

01:18:58.655 --> 01:18:59.615
There it is. Push it.

01:18:59.698 --> 01:19:00.657
Somebody help her.

01:19:00.741 --> 01:19:02.326
Okay, I gotta grab it.

01:19:04.661 --> 01:19:06.538
Guess I had a little control
right away.

01:19:06.663 --> 01:19:08.457
I'm flyin', y'all.

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:11.543
Okay, what's next, Blanca?

01:19:11.627 --> 01:19:12.920
I would...

01:19:16.298 --> 01:19:17.508
Yes, the flaps!

01:19:17.591 --> 01:19:19.176
The flaps!
Adjusting the flaps.

01:19:19.259 --> 01:19:20.719
What's next?

01:19:20.803 --> 01:19:23.472
I think it was... the trim.

01:19:25.724 --> 01:19:27.392
I cannot hear her.

01:19:27.476 --> 01:19:29.895
I got it.
I see what you're sayin'.

01:19:29.937 --> 01:19:31.021
What's next?

01:19:31.063 --> 01:19:34.107
I don't know. This is where
he usually pops the cork.

01:19:34.983 --> 01:19:36.902
We are so fucked!

01:19:36.944 --> 01:19:38.862
Don't panic, please.
You're gonna be okay.

01:19:38.946 --> 01:19:41.240
You can't use that phone
while we're on the plane.

01:19:41.365 --> 01:19:43.033
Girl, please, they say that
to rip you off.

01:19:43.158 --> 01:19:44.618
They want you to use
their phone.

01:19:44.743 --> 01:19:46.662
- I am calling for some help.
- No, I'm telling you.

01:19:46.745 --> 01:19:48.413
Don't be hardheaded.
Don't use that phone.

01:19:48.497 --> 01:19:50.207
Fuck that!

01:20:13.689 --> 01:20:16.608
Okay. All right.
We back on track right now.

01:20:16.692 --> 01:20:18.152
What next, Blanca?

01:20:18.277 --> 01:20:19.903
The wheels.

01:20:21.113 --> 01:20:22.281
Muggsy, pull the wheels down.

01:20:22.364 --> 01:20:23.782
Grab the wheel
and do it slow.

01:20:24.908 --> 01:20:26.368
I feel it comin' down, y'all,

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:29.663
Oh, yes!

01:20:29.746 --> 01:20:34.168
Oh, D.J., this is it!
It's gonna happen this time, baby.

01:20:34.251 --> 01:20:37.421
We about to die,
you got me tied up down here.

01:20:37.462 --> 01:20:39.214
Damn it, I don't give a fuck.

01:20:39.298 --> 01:20:42.259
We goin' to heaven
with one last nut.

01:20:42.301 --> 01:20:43.635
Nigga, stay focused!

01:20:43.719 --> 01:20:45.721
Yeah! I'm doin' it!

01:20:53.645 --> 01:20:58.567
I told you it was the turbulence.
You don't want none of this.

01:21:05.532 --> 01:21:06.575
Here we go.

01:21:06.658 --> 01:21:08.368
We gonna land.

01:21:21.298 --> 01:21:23.509
New York, here we go!
This is it right here.

01:21:23.634 --> 01:21:24.927
That's the ground!

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.449
We made it.
We gonna live.

01:21:47.533 --> 01:21:49.576
I did it. We down.

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:54.915
You did it!
That's just what you do, cousin.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.041
Exactly what I do!

01:21:56.166 --> 01:21:59.336
You see what I'm sayin'?
I was so scared.

01:21:59.378 --> 01:22:01.255
You crazy bitch!
Fuck this airline!

01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:05.092
You know what, she was
on the way out anyway.

01:22:05.134 --> 01:22:08.470
- Forget her, baby. You did it.
- I did.

01:22:12.558 --> 01:22:14.351
Yeah, I can do that.

01:22:15.602 --> 01:22:17.563
All right, y'all
with the mushy stuff.

01:22:17.646 --> 01:22:19.606
I'm a go check on
the passengers.

01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:21.859
- Y'all just too cute.
- My boy.

01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:27.531
Maybe we should go, too.
We should check on 'em, too.

01:22:27.614 --> 01:22:29.074
All right. Come on.

01:22:30.242 --> 01:22:32.369
What a day.

01:22:34.079 --> 01:22:37.457
Wait a minute.
Hold that, sugar dumplin'.

01:22:39.084 --> 01:22:40.669
I don't know
what smells better--

01:22:40.752 --> 01:22:44.131
the New York air
or your magnificent perfume.

01:22:44.214 --> 01:22:47.217
Why, thank you.
That's very kind of you.

01:22:48.719 --> 01:22:50.179
Wait a minute.

01:22:53.682 --> 01:22:55.309
That's an Adam's apple.

01:22:55.392 --> 01:22:58.353
I'm a player, but I don't play
that way. Floor walker!

01:22:58.437 --> 01:22:59.646
No, I...

01:22:59.771 --> 01:23:01.690
- Hey, Muggs.
- Yo, cousin.

01:23:01.773 --> 01:23:03.442
That's what I'm talkin' about.
We made it!

01:23:03.567 --> 01:23:06.862
What kind of shit--
this is Central Park.

01:23:06.945 --> 01:23:09.615
Where is Central Park?
It's in New York, ain't it?

01:23:09.698 --> 01:23:11.492
You got JFK, LaGuardia,
Newark--

01:23:11.575 --> 01:23:13.702
What you need an airport for,
you got all this grass?

01:23:13.785 --> 01:23:18.165
Ain't this a bitch?
This nigga is pissin' on the plane!

01:23:18.248 --> 01:23:21.210
That's your problem.
You always thinkin' on the nega--

01:23:22.794 --> 01:23:27.049
Hell, no, I know they didn't
just steal my damn rims.

01:23:27.132 --> 01:23:29.384
That's what your punk ass get.

01:23:29.468 --> 01:23:31.512
You know how hard it is
to get 84-inch rims?

01:23:31.637 --> 01:23:34.097
That's a big-ass tire
for a little-ass plane

01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:35.265
and a short-ass nigga.

01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:37.643
Why don't you go put
a doughnut in your mouth?

01:23:37.726 --> 01:23:39.937
I am going to sue your ass,
I am gonna sue the airline...

01:23:39.978 --> 01:23:41.980
That's all you do is complain.

01:23:42.064 --> 01:23:45.150
It doesn't matter, I'm not
gonna let you spoil this for me.

01:23:45.234 --> 01:23:47.736
I tell you what,
Muggs, take everybody upstairs.

01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.446
Drinks on me.
Let's party!

01:23:50.989 --> 01:23:52.866
<i>And we did party.</i>

01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:56.453
<i>Just like I told y'all--
we fly, we party and we land.</i>

01:24:36.618 --> 01:24:38.829
Pop, where'd you get
the moves from?

01:24:38.912 --> 01:24:40.539
