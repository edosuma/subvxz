00:00.889 --> 00:02.357
<i>Previously, on</i>
"Riverdale"...

00:02.445 --> 00:03.953
Are you engaged to Edgar?

00:04.041 --> 00:07.478
Edgar and I have a deep
understanding of one another.

00:07.587 --> 00:09.103
- How'd it go?
- Great.

00:09.166 --> 00:10.614
<i>No one suspects anything.</i>

00:10.666 --> 00:11.806
Little last-minute boost.

00:11.894 --> 00:13.140
He's juicing.
Take something

00:13.228 --> 00:14.314
to level the playing field.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.392
I don't take that stuff.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.212
Something's wrong. Ronson's
on some kind of crazy drug.

00:19.275 --> 00:20.416
We need a doctor.

00:20.504 --> 00:23.508
<i>You moved to town to take
the drug trade from Hiram Lodge?</i>

00:23.596 --> 00:25.812
Someone's looking
to reopen the candy store.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.003
He needs to know exactly
what you're doing.

00:28.091 --> 00:29.439
No, he doesn't.

00:29.526 --> 00:30.962
<i>You've hurt
a lot of people, Kurtz.</i>

00:31.049 --> 00:33.258
What were you thinking?
The ultimate quest.

00:33.452 --> 00:35.240
<i>One final game</i>

00:35.328 --> 00:36.303
for you

00:36.391 --> 00:37.662
and your family.

00:37.750 --> 00:39.789
<i>Save the Little Princess.</i>

00:39.970 --> 00:41.117
What the hell did you do?

00:41.204 --> 00:42.750
What did you do?

00:44.054 --> 00:46.203
Jellybean! Jellybean!

00:47.386 --> 00:48.805
Dad.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.547
What the hell is that?

00:54.516 --> 00:57.719
"I invite you to play a round
of Gryphons and Gargoyles,

00:57.875 --> 01:01.638
"The outcome of which will determine
Princess Jellybean's fate."

01:01.725 --> 01:03.061
Hey.

01:03.260 --> 01:06.061
Why is the door wide open?

01:06.975 --> 01:08.478
What's wrong?

01:08.772 --> 01:10.116
Where's JB?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.499
She was taken.

01:14.913 --> 01:16.475
By the Gargoyle King,

01:16.577 --> 01:18.913
and his loyal servant, Kurtz.

01:23.803 --> 01:25.465
We have to find that
son of a bitch.

01:25.567 --> 01:26.778
Find him?

01:26.866 --> 01:29.280
He's outside
in the back of my cruiser.

01:47.397 --> 01:48.622
Ms. Ronson.

01:48.710 --> 01:49.928
Yes.

01:51.093 --> 01:53.155
We did everything we could,
I'm very sorry.

01:53.243 --> 01:54.428
How did this happen?

01:54.516 --> 01:56.640
We'll know more
after the autopsy comes back.

01:56.727 --> 01:58.008
We need to see him.

01:58.096 --> 01:59.106
Of course.

01:59.194 --> 02:00.624
The nurse will show you.

02:04.441 --> 02:06.441
- Dr. Patel.
- Yes.

02:07.670 --> 02:09.502
Listen, there's something
you should know.

02:10.225 --> 02:11.260
Randy was juicing.

02:11.348 --> 02:12.529
Excuse me?

02:12.647 --> 02:14.064
You gave it to him.

02:14.151 --> 02:16.161
I would never give
one of my fighters drugs.

02:16.249 --> 02:18.101
What Randy chose
to put into his body,

02:18.188 --> 02:19.960
unbeknownst to me,
is not my responsibility.

02:20.069 --> 02:21.461
Well, aren't you
Manager of the Year?

02:21.548 --> 02:23.239
His blood is on your hands.

02:23.327 --> 02:26.350
No, his blood is all over
Archie's hands, literally.

02:26.587 --> 02:28.296
Better lawyer up, Andrews,

02:28.419 --> 02:31.020
you killed him in that ring,
and you know it.

02:36.799 --> 02:39.548
Where the hell is my daughter?

02:39.643 --> 02:43.026
Tell me or I'll kill you
right here, right now.

02:43.113 --> 02:45.108
Where are you
keeping her, Kurtz?

02:45.196 --> 02:47.044
With an associate.

02:47.382 --> 02:49.232
Being very well taken care of.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.108
He's not gonna tell us.

02:52.970 --> 02:55.788
Accept the invite to play.

02:55.892 --> 03:00.505
Let's see if you can bring
Jellybean home.

03:01.563 --> 03:02.639
He's crazy.

03:02.727 --> 03:04.375
How can we believe anything
he has to say.

03:04.463 --> 03:06.591
I've played this game enough
to know that guys like Kurtz

03:06.678 --> 03:07.848
are completely devoted

03:07.936 --> 03:09.559
to the Gargoyle King
and his rules.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.321
If we play and we win,

03:11.468 --> 03:13.475
we can get Jellybean back.

03:13.936 --> 03:15.428
I'm sure of it.

03:19.088 --> 03:20.538
We'll agree to your terms.

03:21.282 --> 03:22.655
We'll play.

03:23.522 --> 03:25.355
Of course, you will.

03:26.730 --> 03:29.686
First, your avatars.

03:29.801 --> 03:32.608
Mr. Jones will be Deadeye.

03:33.196 --> 03:34.538
Like in high school.

03:34.626 --> 03:36.061
Jughead,

03:36.733 --> 03:38.811
you will remain the Hellcaster.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.046
And Mrs. Jones,

03:41.204 --> 03:42.561
you'll be

03:42.649 --> 03:44.464
the Alchemist,

03:44.556 --> 03:45.952
I think.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.356
Deadeye,

03:50.114 --> 03:51.446
you're up first.

04:06.229 --> 04:07.944
Son, from everything
you've said,

04:08.031 --> 04:10.080
it's clear that Randy
died from those drugs,

04:10.168 --> 04:12.515
An autopsy will support that.
You're innocent.

04:12.602 --> 04:14.102
I'm not, Dad.

04:16.596 --> 04:17.827
I knew.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.562
I knew Randy was juicing.

04:20.744 --> 04:24.112
I could've stopped the fight,
but I didn't wanna forfeit.

04:24.517 --> 04:25.917
If I had...

04:28.718 --> 04:31.553
I'm never stepping
into that ring ever again.

04:33.516 --> 04:34.851
I can't.

04:38.607 --> 04:40.162
<i>Thanks for meeting us, Daddy.</i>

04:40.249 --> 04:43.246
I understand I missed
quite the fight earlier.

04:43.333 --> 04:44.859
That's not why we're here.

04:45.303 --> 04:47.403
Betty has a favor
she wants to ask you.

04:49.180 --> 04:50.506
Mr. Lodge,

04:50.700 --> 04:53.750
my dad is incarcerated,
two hours away,

04:53.838 --> 04:55.726
in a windowless cell.

04:55.835 --> 04:57.627
It's a horrible place,

04:57.714 --> 05:00.505
and he heard
about your facility,

05:00.593 --> 05:03.466
and how some of the cells even
have views of Sweetwater River.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.235
Yeah, the waterfront rooms.

05:05.322 --> 05:06.770
They're quite peaceful.

05:06.857 --> 05:09.305
He would like to be
transferred to one.

05:09.499 --> 05:11.508
And I thought
since you owned the place,

05:11.595 --> 05:13.743
maybe you could help.

05:13.915 --> 05:15.648
Think of all the publicity.

05:23.039 --> 05:24.506
I'll see what I can do.

05:29.733 --> 05:30.981
Mad Dog.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.827
What did you do
with the drugs I gave you?

05:32.983 --> 05:34.927
They're in my locker
at the gym. Why?

05:35.015 --> 05:36.420
Archie, you need
to get rid of them now.

05:36.507 --> 05:37.867
Police showed up
at Elio's gym,

05:37.954 --> 05:39.045
<i>they had a warrant,
and did a full sweep.</i>

05:39.132 --> 05:40.398
They didn't find anything.

05:40.499 --> 05:42.019
But what if they hit up
El Royale next?

05:42.609 --> 05:43.706
I'm on my way.

05:43.793 --> 05:45.126
I'll meet you there.

05:47.438 --> 05:49.312
Come on, man, hurry up.

05:49.399 --> 05:50.695
I got it.

05:53.370 --> 05:56.004
Hands up! Both of you!

05:58.732 --> 06:00.532
He's got nothing
to do with this.

06:10.656 --> 06:13.312
You've reached
your first challenge.

06:13.978 --> 06:16.015
This one's easy.

06:16.526 --> 06:18.257
It's called,
"Cards on the table."

06:18.359 --> 06:22.325
Inside two of these pouches

06:22.413 --> 06:23.755
is a white marble.

06:23.843 --> 06:25.663
Inside the third,
is a black one.

06:25.827 --> 06:29.352
If you choose the black one,
you must reveal your secret.

06:29.439 --> 06:30.653
Simple enough.

06:30.740 --> 06:32.288
Call it what you want.

06:32.375 --> 06:34.616
We've been playing, "Secrets
and Sins" since high school.

06:34.776 --> 06:36.062
Alchemist.

06:37.781 --> 06:39.229
Why don't you begin?

06:53.402 --> 06:54.839
Be honest.

06:55.027 --> 06:57.865
The King already knows
your darkest truths.

07:01.104 --> 07:02.352
I don't have any secrets.

07:02.439 --> 07:05.355
Mom, Jellybean's life
is on the line.

07:05.442 --> 07:07.628
If you don't say something,
I will.

07:07.981 --> 07:10.066
What's he talking about?

07:12.482 --> 07:14.861
I'm the new Fizzle Rocks dealer
in Riverdale.

07:14.949 --> 07:19.102
And Kurtz used to work for me
before he lost his damn mind.

07:19.316 --> 07:20.670
What?

07:23.660 --> 07:25.931
And you knew about this,
you didn't tell me, boy?

07:26.019 --> 07:26.993
Don't blame him.

07:27.081 --> 07:28.211
I told him
not to say anything

07:28.298 --> 07:29.791
because I wanted
to keep you out of it.

07:29.878 --> 07:31.650
I did it protect you,
to protect the family.

07:31.738 --> 07:33.589
How's that working
for Jellybean?

07:33.755 --> 07:35.236
Huh?

07:35.324 --> 07:38.287
You are the reason that this
psycho kidnapped our daughter.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.189
You brought this
into our lives.

07:40.277 --> 07:41.391
Dad.

07:41.478 --> 07:42.712
I've heard enough.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.394
I've heard enough.

07:44.596 --> 07:46.378
We need to finish
this damn game,

07:46.698 --> 07:49.073
and get Jellybean back home
safe and sound.

07:49.161 --> 07:51.964
But there will be
a reckoning.

07:53.910 --> 07:55.679

Episode Title:
<font color=#FFFF00>"Chapter Fifty-Four: Fear the Reape"</font>

08:00.906 --> 08:01.930
Hey, Dad.

08:02.018 --> 08:03.514
It's Josie.

08:04.278 --> 08:05.459
Um,

08:05.547 --> 08:10.360
I saw you have a gig
at Toubadour in Seaside.

08:10.876 --> 08:15.014
Uh, would you maybe wanna
grab some dinner beforehand?

08:16.390 --> 08:18.824
Call me back and let me know.

08:21.274 --> 08:24.407
Well, everyone's gearing up
for the big wedding.

08:24.766 --> 08:26.946
You know, between your mom
and Edgar.

08:27.034 --> 08:28.949
Yeah, I'm, I'm aware.

08:29.163 --> 08:30.978
There is also something else
you should know.

08:31.065 --> 08:32.359
After the big wedding,

08:32.447 --> 08:35.953
Edgar's planning to adopt
Juniper and Dagwood.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.884
I posted your bail
as soon as I could.

08:44.668 --> 08:45.967
Thanks, Ronnie.

08:47.266 --> 08:48.356
We'll pay you back.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.337
Gentlemen, that's the least
of our worries.

08:50.618 --> 08:52.680
Elio's been a busy bee.

08:53.196 --> 08:55.023
<i>...now that
Randy Ronson's autopsy</i>

08:55.110 --> 08:56.270
<i>has revealed the ugly truth.</i>

08:56.364 --> 08:57.852
<i>And what truth is that?</i>

08:57.940 --> 09:00.171
<i>That he was indeed taking
performance enhancing drugs</i>

09:00.259 --> 09:02.810
<i>provided by his competitor
Archie Andrews.</i>

09:02.985 --> 09:04.645
<i>Alice Smith...</i>

09:04.732 --> 09:05.880
This is nuts.

09:06.048 --> 09:07.819
Elio's the one
who gave Randy the drugs.

09:07.907 --> 09:09.827
That may be impossible
to prove.

09:09.915 --> 09:12.204
He's setting me up
to take the fall, Ronnie.

09:13.046 --> 09:14.216
Am I screwed?

09:14.304 --> 09:16.063
With me in your corner?

09:16.243 --> 09:17.352
Never.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.805
I'm going to dog walk
that lying cad.

09:22.116 --> 09:23.618
But we do need
to play defense.

09:23.706 --> 09:24.831
How do we do that?

09:24.919 --> 09:26.485
First things first,

09:28.398 --> 09:29.931
drink up, boys.

09:38.599 --> 09:41.108
Man, this is humiliating.

09:41.196 --> 09:43.502
Well, I guess you've
never been on parole.

09:45.039 --> 09:48.222
I am pleased to announce that
the results of the drug test

09:48.309 --> 09:50.992
taken by Archie Andrews
and Mad Dog Moore

09:51.079 --> 09:53.094
have both come back negative.

09:53.321 --> 09:56.462
And as the investigation
into the horrific death

09:56.554 --> 09:58.040
of Randy Ronson continues...

09:58.136 --> 10:00.036
He murdered our brother.

10:01.356 --> 10:04.538
Ms. Ronson, I assure you,
Archie didn't...

10:04.626 --> 10:06.805
You should fry
for what you did.

10:08.938 --> 10:11.245
Ms. Ronson, believe me,
if I could take back what...

10:11.333 --> 10:13.524
Oh, did you get that?

10:15.055 --> 10:16.782
I'm so sorry.

10:17.305 --> 10:19.352
I wish it were me
and not him.

10:20.016 --> 10:22.223
I think you're not alone
in that sentiment, Andrews.

10:31.819 --> 10:33.267
Evelyn,

10:33.354 --> 10:36.895
have you already received
your meningitis vaccination?

10:37.129 --> 10:38.204
No.

10:38.292 --> 10:39.474
The Farm doesn't believe

10:39.562 --> 10:42.013
in putting foreign substances
into our bodies.

10:42.144 --> 10:43.363
You can check my file.

10:43.451 --> 10:45.050
My father wrote Mr. Weatherbee
a letter

10:45.138 --> 10:48.231
opting me out of all elective
medical procedures.

10:54.509 --> 10:56.356
"Check my file."

10:57.111 --> 10:58.844
I think I just might.

11:39.754 --> 11:42.721
"Transferred from
St. Joseph Prep..."

11:56.137 --> 11:59.913
Finally, you've reached
your next quest.

12:00.808 --> 12:04.158
You steal some treasure
from the realm.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.788
What treasure?

12:06.814 --> 12:08.796
He wants us
to commit a robbery.

12:08.883 --> 12:09.930
You've gotta be kidding.

12:10.018 --> 12:10.865
I'm the Sheriff.

12:10.952 --> 12:11.899
- Mmm-mmm.
- Not tonight.

12:11.986 --> 12:14.079
Tonight, you're the Deadeye.

12:14.222 --> 12:15.509
Your target.

12:16.858 --> 12:18.181
The Tavern.

12:20.345 --> 12:22.593
So if everything
is parallel for Riverdale,

12:22.681 --> 12:25.746
then the Tavern is Pop's.

12:25.833 --> 12:29.101
Consider it
Jellybean's ransom.

12:31.235 --> 12:33.921
And the money you obtain
is gonna get me out of town.

12:34.008 --> 12:35.556
You're not going anywhere.

12:35.786 --> 12:37.969
The only way this ends, Kurtz,
is with you in the ground.

12:38.056 --> 12:41.134
If I die, so does Jellybean.

12:45.686 --> 12:47.920
But if I leave with the money,

12:48.428 --> 12:49.759
then she lives.

12:50.448 --> 12:51.946
And we all win.

13:07.883 --> 13:10.113
Archie, did you run here?

13:10.201 --> 13:11.441
It's pouring outside.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.498
I can't stop
thinking about Randy.

13:13.803 --> 13:16.171
And Randy's sister, when she
said to me that I'm a murderer.

13:16.258 --> 13:18.974
Archie, this is not
your fault.

13:19.061 --> 13:20.288
This is on Elio, not you.

13:20.376 --> 13:22.911
I still feel
responsible, Veronica.

13:22.998 --> 13:24.264
I just, I wish...

13:25.400 --> 13:26.923
I knew how to help them.

13:27.636 --> 13:29.051
Maybe

13:29.271 --> 13:31.718
El Royale can host
a charity boxing event,

13:31.806 --> 13:32.854
we can raise money
for their family.

13:32.941 --> 13:34.356
No. No boxing.

13:34.443 --> 13:35.485
Okay, fine.

13:35.573 --> 13:38.897
Um, we can host a benefit
concert at La Bonne Nuit.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.069
Josie has been calling me
about doing a set

13:41.157 --> 13:44.418
so let me talk to her,
and the Ronsons, okay?

13:45.153 --> 13:46.534
Okay.

13:46.621 --> 13:47.954
- Thank you,
- Yeah.

13:49.391 --> 13:52.376
Hi, is this
the Gilroy Academy?

13:52.962 --> 13:54.943
I'm Doris Bell
from the principal's office

13:55.030 --> 13:56.144
at Riverdale High.

13:56.231 --> 13:57.765
We have a recent transfer

13:57.853 --> 14:00.081
who attended your school
a couple of years back.

14:00.168 --> 14:01.950
Evelyn Evernever.

14:02.037 --> 14:03.852
I'm just checking
our records.

14:03.969 --> 14:05.802
What grade was she in?

14:07.534 --> 14:08.848
A junior?

14:09.077 --> 14:10.418
Yes, that's what I thought.

14:10.506 --> 14:11.705
Thank you so much.

14:13.729 --> 14:15.478
Five for five.

14:19.187 --> 14:20.535
Ms. Weiss,

14:20.622 --> 14:23.978
do you remember
Edgar Evernever from the Farm?

14:24.392 --> 14:26.647
I can't find out anything
about his past,

14:26.735 --> 14:29.665
but I did find something
about his daughter, Evelyn.

14:31.507 --> 14:33.907
She's been
repeating her junior year.

14:34.032 --> 14:36.226
Enrolling in different
high schools,

14:36.314 --> 14:39.539
pretending to be 17
for over a decade.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.274
Oh, my God.

14:41.409 --> 14:42.424
Yeah.

14:42.626 --> 14:44.292
I think from what I found,

14:44.379 --> 14:46.015
Edgar works on the parents,

14:46.103 --> 14:47.453
while Evelyn is sent
to high school

14:47.540 --> 14:49.806
to recruit teens
into the Farm.

14:49.978 --> 14:51.966
It's a cover for their cult.

14:52.056 --> 14:53.571
I just need concrete proof.

14:53.696 --> 14:55.360
I'm happy
to make some inquiries.

14:55.470 --> 14:56.604
I'll see what I can find out.

14:56.691 --> 14:59.325
Thank you, Ms. Weiss.

15:01.015 --> 15:02.663
I can't believe
we're doing this.

15:02.751 --> 15:04.112
We're in and out
in 30 seconds.

15:04.199 --> 15:05.845
Let me do the talking.

15:07.214 --> 15:09.863
Kinda reminds you
of the old days, huh?

15:10.005 --> 15:11.205
You guys
have done this before?

15:11.329 --> 15:12.622
Ah, we're not
getting into this.

15:16.954 --> 15:18.845
Thanks again for coming, Dad.

15:18.994 --> 15:20.242
It's nice to catch up.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.696
My next tour
is gonna be a long one.

15:23.189 --> 15:26.595
Well, that's actually why
I wanted to meet up.

15:27.517 --> 15:30.733
Recently, I've been
headlining act downstairs

15:30.821 --> 15:32.107
at La Bonne Nuit.

15:32.326 --> 15:34.574
But Riverdale's a small town.

15:34.704 --> 15:37.812
And I wanna broaden
my musical horizons.

15:37.899 --> 15:39.689
So I thought

15:39.913 --> 15:43.181
maybe I could go on tour

15:43.446 --> 15:44.486
with you.

15:44.573 --> 15:46.754
Josie,

15:46.841 --> 15:49.103
it's a hard life
being on the road.

15:49.204 --> 15:52.993
Please, just
come and see me perform.

15:53.103 --> 15:54.790
I've got a set tonight.

15:56.151 --> 15:58.642
Everybody,
on the ground, right now!

15:59.709 --> 16:01.142
Get down!

16:15.070 --> 16:16.518
Pop! Pops, don't.

16:16.605 --> 16:17.685
This isn't what you think.

16:17.772 --> 16:19.615
- Go! Go! Go!
- Go!

16:19.703 --> 16:21.805
- We gotta go! We gotta go!
- Dad.

16:21.953 --> 16:23.459
- Dad! Dad!
- Damn it, we gotta go!

16:23.547 --> 16:25.226
Go! Go!

16:25.313 --> 16:26.984
Save Jellybean.

16:27.453 --> 16:31.492
Now do you see why I need to
get the hell out of this town?

16:33.526 --> 16:34.844
Oh, my God.

16:37.425 --> 16:38.773
And then there were two.

16:42.033 --> 16:43.221
The cops are probably

16:43.309 --> 16:44.541
- on their way over here.
- Yeah.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.404
- We gotta move somewhere.
- Yeah.

16:46.492 --> 16:47.657
Oh, I got a place.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.407
<i>I have good news, Dad.</i>

16:50.705 --> 16:53.227
Your transfer papers
have been processed.

16:53.315 --> 16:55.063
Mr. Lodge says
you could be moved

16:55.151 --> 16:56.440
by the end of the week.

16:56.678 --> 16:58.311
Thank you, Betty.

16:59.026 --> 17:00.229
Yeah.

17:05.885 --> 17:07.948
But something's
bothering you.

17:08.356 --> 17:09.656
What is it?

17:12.327 --> 17:13.945
Edgar Evernever decided

17:14.034 --> 17:16.797
he wants to adopt the twins
after he marries mom.

17:16.885 --> 17:18.455
Now, that can't happen.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.617
Juniper and Dagwood
must be protected.

17:21.704 --> 17:22.549
I agree.

17:22.653 --> 17:24.547
That's why I'm talking
to a social worker.

17:24.635 --> 17:28.010
Well, there's someone else
who might help you.

17:28.291 --> 17:32.925
Someone uniquely motivated
to help you.

17:34.249 --> 17:36.598
Auntie,
I need your help.

17:36.964 --> 17:41.407
Edgar Evernever and the Farm
have nefarious intentions.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.657
I can feel it.

17:42.745 --> 17:45.006
He plans to adopt
your grandchildren,

17:45.093 --> 17:46.774
and raise them as his own.

17:46.932 --> 17:50.545
Polly, my mom, even Cheryl,
they made their decision.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.165
But the twins are innocent.

17:52.253 --> 17:53.533
Helpless.

17:54.936 --> 17:56.167
Auntie,

17:56.438 --> 17:58.938
you know what it's like
to be adopted into a family

17:59.026 --> 18:01.007
that only wants
to control you.

18:05.413 --> 18:06.728
Ha...

18:06.854 --> 18:09.001
Dagwood... Where's Juniper?

18:09.089 --> 18:09.998
She's staying.

18:10.085 --> 18:12.550
We get the boy,
but Edgar keeps the girl.

18:12.682 --> 18:14.588
Those were the only terms
that they would accept,

18:14.675 --> 18:17.190
despite my threats to come
after the Farm in court...

18:17.325 --> 18:19.094
Uh... They're twins.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.133
You can't separate them.

18:21.221 --> 18:22.860
And Edgar
isn't even their father...

18:22.948 --> 18:25.126
But Polly is their mother,
it was her decision.

18:25.214 --> 18:26.917
No, Auntie.

18:27.042 --> 18:28.809
Betty, it's a miracle

18:28.928 --> 18:31.219
I could negotiate
the release of one twin.

18:31.306 --> 18:32.745
Jason Junior.

18:32.833 --> 18:33.847
Don't feel bad.

18:33.973 --> 18:35.055
This is a win.

18:35.143 --> 18:36.242
But...

18:41.703 --> 18:43.012
Slow day?

18:45.973 --> 18:47.335
What the hell
are you doing here, Elio?

18:47.422 --> 18:49.395
We have some
unfinished business.

18:52.325 --> 18:55.209
$50,000, courtesy
of the Gilded Gloves.

18:55.348 --> 18:57.309
Despite what happened
to poor Randy, you did win.

18:57.467 --> 18:58.633
It's yours.

18:59.801 --> 19:01.325
I don't want
your blood-money.

19:02.404 --> 19:03.718
Don't be a fool, Archie.

19:03.805 --> 19:05.666
You went 12 rounds
in your first fight.

19:05.754 --> 19:06.987
You're a winner.

19:07.075 --> 19:09.090
I could take you
all the way to Vegas.

19:09.177 --> 19:11.426
I'd call you
the "Riverdale Reaper."

19:11.817 --> 19:13.558
People'll pay a lot of money
to see you in the ring.

19:13.645 --> 19:15.660
After all,
you're a killer now.

19:17.519 --> 19:19.400
Three against one.
Bad odds, even for you.

19:19.487 --> 19:20.885
Get the hell out of my gym.

19:20.973 --> 19:23.395
Consider my offer, Reaper.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.531
Kurtz is an insidious bastard.

19:36.625 --> 19:37.945
I mean, even
if we save Jellybean,

19:38.053 --> 19:39.531
we still lose.

19:41.011 --> 19:43.159
I just robbed Pop's
at gunpoint.

19:43.246 --> 19:45.347
It was unloaded, but still.

19:46.817 --> 19:49.417
How can we stay in Riverdale
after that?

19:50.620 --> 19:52.502
We don't.

19:52.780 --> 19:55.572
We get in a car,
and we drive up north.

19:55.827 --> 19:59.842
And we keep going until we find
a town where nobody knows us.

20:01.163 --> 20:03.031
You just don't get it,
do you?

20:05.041 --> 20:06.444
Riverdale's our home.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.955
Dad and I live here.

20:08.043 --> 20:09.467
We're happy here.

20:11.541 --> 20:12.889
It's you.

20:14.406 --> 20:16.663
You destroyed that.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.513
<i>I talked
to Randy's sister earlier.</i>

20:24.600 --> 20:25.802
On top of everything else,

20:25.889 --> 20:28.631
Elio is denying them
Randy's insurance money.

20:29.014 --> 20:30.156
They got nothing.

20:30.244 --> 20:31.576
But he can't do that.

20:32.186 --> 20:33.614
Well, I was hoping we could

20:33.702 --> 20:35.559
make your show tonight
a benefit, Josie.

20:35.647 --> 20:36.913
With the proceeds
going to the Ronsons.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.715
Absolutely, Veronica,
whatever you need.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.849
I'll do my best to make it
back in time for your set.

20:40.936 --> 20:42.152
Back from what?

20:42.366 --> 20:44.045
Settling it with Elio.

20:52.217 --> 20:53.262
What the hell?

20:53.350 --> 20:55.256
Sleepy time is over, Kurtz.

20:55.685 --> 20:57.100
What's the next challenge?

21:04.603 --> 21:06.091
It's a doozie.

21:07.174 --> 21:09.005
Trial with the Cyclops.

21:10.210 --> 21:11.792
Cyclops?

21:12.317 --> 21:15.091
It's not a character class
that I've ever read about.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.801
I might know
what he's talking about.

21:33.123 --> 21:34.849
I'm sorry, Josie.

21:34.958 --> 21:36.284
I double-checked
at the door,

21:36.372 --> 21:38.849
but your dad didn't
pick up his ticket.

21:40.730 --> 21:42.417
Why am I not surprised?

21:42.505 --> 21:44.581
Are you sure
you're still up for this?

21:44.668 --> 21:45.882
Yeah.

21:45.969 --> 21:47.224
I'm fine.

21:47.713 --> 21:49.599
And the show
must go on, right?

21:51.408 --> 21:53.810
Okay. Break a leg, girl.

22:06.413 --> 22:08.067
Where you going
at this hour?

22:09.349 --> 22:11.270
The Reaper himself.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.162
Finally come to your senses,
and reconsidered my offer?

22:14.802 --> 22:16.112
No.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.481
But I will be taking
that prize money after all.

22:18.568 --> 22:21.067
I thought
it was "blood-money."

22:21.239 --> 22:23.911
You made a promise
to the Ronson family.

22:24.274 --> 22:25.870
That money is theirs.

22:25.958 --> 22:27.424
So give me that check,

22:27.661 --> 22:29.770
and I'll let you leave here
in one piece.

22:29.925 --> 22:31.782
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

22:36.487 --> 22:38.387
Still wanna call me
the Reaper?

22:44.223 --> 22:47.298
You should be paying
the Ronsons ten times this.

22:52.435 --> 22:55.821
This was once
the Gargoyle lair.

22:56.678 --> 22:57.993
Come... Come on.

22:58.175 --> 23:01.276
Now, it's a Serpent den.

23:01.725 --> 23:02.891
Tonight,

23:03.847 --> 23:05.188
a battlefield.

23:12.703 --> 23:14.173
Penny Peabody?

23:15.399 --> 23:16.773
You are the Cyclops?
I thought you were...

23:16.860 --> 23:18.274
Dead? Oh.

23:18.485 --> 23:20.883
Is that what Mommy told you?

23:21.264 --> 23:23.913
No, it was an eye for an eye.

23:24.227 --> 23:27.219
Though I'm sure she wishes now
that she has finished the job.

23:27.469 --> 23:29.118
And your weapons

23:29.372 --> 23:30.891
will be this...

23:36.116 --> 23:38.532
As decreed by the King.

23:50.734 --> 23:53.071
You ever held
these before, Jones?

23:53.863 --> 23:55.078
Once or twice.

23:55.165 --> 23:56.266
Players,

23:56.633 --> 23:57.947
on my mark.

23:58.188 --> 23:59.949
Let the battle begin.

24:00.102 --> 24:05.755
<i>♪ He left no time to regret ♪</i>

24:06.024 --> 24:09.259
<i>♪ Kept his lips wet ♪</i>

24:09.346 --> 24:13.829
<i>♪ With his same old safe bet ♪</i>

24:15.517 --> 24:21.436
<i>♪ Me and my head high ♪</i>

24:21.524 --> 24:24.774
<i>♪ And my tears dry ♪</i>

24:24.861 --> 24:30.975
<i>♪ Get on without my guy ♪</i>

24:31.063 --> 24:37.053
<i>♪ You went back
To what you knew ♪</i>

24:37.140 --> 24:40.256
<i>♪ So far removed ♪</i>

24:40.343 --> 24:45.633
<i>♪ From all that
We went through ♪</i>

24:51.488 --> 24:52.688
Mom.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.295
This is a two-player game,

24:55.383 --> 24:57.586
if you move again,
your sister will pay the price.

25:01.597 --> 25:02.800
Stop!

25:02.888 --> 25:05.034
You just need to defeat her
to complete the quest.

25:06.069 --> 25:07.441
You did that.

25:07.737 --> 25:09.386
Let's go.

25:15.578 --> 25:17.779
I guess
you'll be limping home.

25:19.783 --> 25:21.431
Come on, let's get you
to the hospital.

25:21.518 --> 25:22.706
Come on.

25:25.989 --> 25:30.106
<i>♪ We only said goodbye
With words ♪</i>

25:30.193 --> 25:34.010
<i>♪ I died a hundred times ♪</i>

25:34.097 --> 25:36.913
<i>♪ You go back to her ♪</i>

25:37.000 --> 25:41.551
<i>♪ And I go back to... ♪</i>

25:41.638 --> 25:44.520
<i>♪ Black ♪</i>

26:03.426 --> 26:04.956
Ms. Weiss.

26:05.528 --> 26:06.863
What is it?
What did you find?

26:06.980 --> 26:08.696
Betty, I followed her
paper trail.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.863
You were right. Evelyn is
much older than she appears.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.617
26, to be exact.

26:14.704 --> 26:16.488
I also found this.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.277
Evelyn is
Edgar Evernever's wife,

26:19.542 --> 26:21.089
not daughter.

26:28.508 --> 26:29.655
Toni,

26:30.064 --> 26:31.646
are you in a place
where you can talk?

26:31.745 --> 26:32.751
It's urgent.

26:32.829 --> 26:34.788
I've gotta get back
into the Farm.

26:42.345 --> 26:44.360
And then there was one.

26:44.694 --> 26:47.241
I just dropped my mom off
at the emergency room

26:47.710 --> 26:50.133
for a broken arm
and ruptured kidney.

26:50.221 --> 26:51.528
My dad's been shot,

26:51.898 --> 26:54.028
and my little sister's being
held against her will.

26:54.147 --> 26:58.601
So you are going to take me
to Jellybean right now.

26:59.429 --> 27:00.718
Fair enough.

27:01.421 --> 27:02.854
But I'll drive.

27:03.833 --> 27:05.538
And you'll wear this.

27:08.705 --> 27:11.788
You gave a wonderful
performance tonight.

27:12.101 --> 27:13.408
Thanks, Dad.

27:14.452 --> 27:16.593
But I have to be honest,

27:16.898 --> 27:18.499
I thought you bailed on me

27:18.601 --> 27:20.096
again.

27:20.382 --> 27:22.726
That was my intention.

27:24.053 --> 27:25.501
When you're on the road,

27:25.687 --> 27:27.036
gig after gig,

27:27.123 --> 27:29.372
you gotta get up on that stage
and give it your all.

27:29.459 --> 27:30.807
No matter what.

27:30.894 --> 27:32.242
Hard truth is,

27:32.329 --> 27:35.530
you gotta wanna play music
more than anything else.

27:38.969 --> 27:40.155
Do you?

27:41.495 --> 27:42.994
100%.

27:44.574 --> 27:46.864
In that case,
start packing.

27:46.952 --> 27:50.233
We got a show in Asheville,
North Carolina tomorrow night.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.894
Thank you, Ms. Ronson,
for agreeing to see me.

27:55.685 --> 27:57.062
I can't

27:57.420 --> 27:58.890
begin to imagine

27:59.257 --> 28:01.070
what it feels like
to lose your brother.

28:01.211 --> 28:02.312
Randy

28:03.624 --> 28:04.841
had demons.

28:04.929 --> 28:07.583
More than you know,
he had a history with drugs.

28:07.671 --> 28:09.249
And we were on our own
really young,

28:09.337 --> 28:12.257
and I... did my best

28:12.554 --> 28:14.224
to raise him
and my sisters right,

28:14.312 --> 28:18.239
but at some point,
he made his own choices.

28:26.082 --> 28:27.874
What's this?

28:29.653 --> 28:32.025
The prize money
from Gilded Gloves.

28:32.113 --> 28:35.379
And some donations
Veronica pulled together.

28:39.444 --> 28:40.743
And there'll be more.

28:48.271 --> 28:49.819
Thank you.

28:50.051 --> 28:51.934
<i>Hurry.
It's up ahead.</i>

28:52.051 --> 28:53.489
You're a life saver, Toni.

28:53.576 --> 28:54.857
Well, you know what they say,

28:54.944 --> 28:57.426
it takes a village
to mercy kidnap a child.

29:12.683 --> 29:15.067
Come on. It's okay.

29:27.387 --> 29:28.686
This way.

29:34.951 --> 29:36.473
Toni, what's happening?

29:37.420 --> 29:39.302
According to Edgar,

29:39.512 --> 29:41.074
only what was preordained.

29:41.291 --> 29:42.623
No.

29:43.193 --> 29:44.549
No, not you too.

29:44.637 --> 29:45.608
Why?

29:45.696 --> 29:48.442
My whole life, I've been
searching for a family.

29:48.530 --> 29:49.712
The Serpents.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.539
The Pretty Poisons.

29:51.678 --> 29:55.069
I've never felt such belonging
as I do here at the Farm.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.483
Mom. Mom.

29:59.676 --> 30:01.317
You can't marry Edgar.

30:01.405 --> 30:03.655
He's already married
to Evelyn.

30:05.882 --> 30:07.864
You think I don't know that?

30:08.170 --> 30:10.718
There are no secrets
here at the Farm.

30:15.392 --> 30:16.840
I don't...

30:17.060 --> 30:18.893
I don't understand...

30:19.315 --> 30:22.011
Why are you all smiling?
What is this about?

30:22.098 --> 30:23.112
You.

30:23.260 --> 30:24.514
Betty.

30:24.854 --> 30:27.799
It's about getting you
to this crossroads.

30:28.772 --> 30:30.080
Join us.

30:31.341 --> 30:33.432
- Join us.
- Everyone you know...

30:33.877 --> 30:35.995
Everyone in your life
is here in this room.

Join us.

30:37.162 --> 30:38.628
- Join us.
- Join us.

30:38.715 --> 30:40.096
Your mother is here.

30:40.183 --> 30:41.336
Your sister is here.

30:41.424 --> 30:44.834
Your best friend Kevin
is here.

30:44.971 --> 30:47.103
- Your principal's here.
- Join us.

30:47.190 --> 30:49.791
Your cousin Cheryl is here.

30:51.361 --> 30:53.230
Be a sister to Polly.

30:53.630 --> 30:58.152
Be a godmother to Juniper.

30:58.510 --> 30:59.942
Join us.

31:00.637 --> 31:01.969
Join us.

31:03.261 --> 31:05.214
Join us, Betty.

31:05.402 --> 31:07.167
We welcome you.

31:15.151 --> 31:16.574
Yes.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.277
Catch her, please.

31:34.910 --> 31:35.964
Stop!

31:36.052 --> 31:38.214
Betty! Betty!

31:40.455 --> 31:41.502
Stop!

31:41.784 --> 31:43.317
Betty. Betty.

31:43.519 --> 31:44.626
Betty.

31:44.714 --> 31:45.873
Betty.

31:45.961 --> 31:47.652
Betty. Betty.

31:58.795 --> 32:00.800
Well done, Hellcaster.

32:04.480 --> 32:07.308
You've made it through
the Valley of Darkness.

32:08.218 --> 32:09.266
And now,

32:09.644 --> 32:11.066
your vision
has been restored.

32:11.191 --> 32:12.488
Where are we?

32:12.653 --> 32:13.767
Where's Jellybean?

32:13.910 --> 32:15.158
Surely, you must be familiar

32:15.245 --> 32:17.660
with the story
of <i> the Lady and the Tiger.</i>

32:17.917 --> 32:21.167
Behind one of these doors
is your sister.

32:21.312 --> 32:23.316
Behind the other's your doom.

32:25.133 --> 32:27.949
The final challenge
is simple, Jughead.

32:28.580 --> 32:29.946
Choose one.

32:44.340 --> 32:46.181
Hey, what's the twist?

32:46.269 --> 32:47.978
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Get in!

32:48.066 --> 32:49.325
Climb into the ice tomb,

32:49.537 --> 32:52.660
and the princess will be freed
with one phone call.

32:56.270 --> 32:57.285
Get in.

32:57.620 --> 32:58.686
No.

32:59.665 --> 33:01.496
Not until I know she's safe.

33:04.694 --> 33:06.097
Put her on.

33:08.653 --> 33:09.701
Hey, Jellybean?

33:09.866 --> 33:11.042
<i>Hey, Jug.</i>

33:11.192 --> 33:12.472
Are you all right?
Where are you?

33:12.602 --> 33:13.816
<i>I just got home.</i>

33:13.903 --> 33:15.751
<i>I'm hanging out
with my pal Ricky.</i>

33:16.010 --> 33:18.274
<i>Don't be mad,
but we've been playing G&G.</i>

33:18.362 --> 33:20.055
<i>I know you said
not to, but...</i>

33:20.143 --> 33:21.378
It's okay.

33:23.046 --> 33:24.635
I'll see you soon, all right?

33:28.041 --> 33:29.339
- All right.
- Get in.

33:29.426 --> 33:30.625
All right. All right.

33:32.889 --> 33:33.836
I did what you want.

33:33.923 --> 33:34.937
Tell Ricky to let her go.

33:35.024 --> 33:37.039
Calm down, Hellcaster.

33:37.243 --> 33:38.624
Acolyte?

33:40.105 --> 33:42.514
The Hellcaster's
been contained.

33:43.194 --> 33:44.515
You may kill the princess.

33:44.602 --> 33:45.833
Kurtz!

33:45.921 --> 33:47.550
You cheated!

34:22.170 --> 34:23.538
What the hell?

34:31.947 --> 34:33.534
Jellybean.

34:38.654 --> 34:40.335
Jellybean. Oh.

34:40.422 --> 34:41.670
Jug.

34:41.757 --> 34:43.991
I'm so glad
you're okay.

34:46.663 --> 34:47.693
Where's Ricky?

34:47.781 --> 34:50.060
He left
right after you called.

34:50.310 --> 34:52.614
That's another turn
of the screw.

34:52.702 --> 34:54.516
- What?
- No...

34:54.888 --> 34:56.918
Nothing. Come here.
Come here, come here.

34:57.005 --> 34:58.139
Hey.

35:02.949 --> 35:04.777
<i>♪ We won't back down ♪</i>

35:04.865 --> 35:06.694
<i>♪ Write this in the sky ♪</i>

35:06.789 --> 35:08.381
<i>♪ We own the night ♪</i>

35:08.469 --> 35:12.264
<i>♪ And we fear nothing ♪</i>

35:19.996 --> 35:21.676
I heard
your show was amazing.

35:21.764 --> 35:23.522
Mmm-hmm, it was.

35:23.610 --> 35:25.740
I'm really sorry
I didn't get back in time.

35:25.928 --> 35:28.017
Well, it's okay.

35:28.217 --> 35:29.756
You had a lot going on.

35:35.011 --> 35:36.287
Archie,

35:37.653 --> 35:40.191
there's something
I need to tell you.

35:43.905 --> 35:46.569
I have decided to go on tour
with my dad.

35:46.656 --> 35:47.873
What?

35:48.224 --> 35:50.912
Josie, that's...

35:51.264 --> 35:53.643
Wait, when?
Like, over the summer?

35:53.730 --> 35:55.881
No, like, immediately.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.350
You're gonna
come back though, right?

35:58.635 --> 35:59.767
Maybe.

36:00.503 --> 36:01.756
We'll see.

36:03.006 --> 36:05.358
Archie, I've loved
our time together.

36:06.029 --> 36:07.722
But we're not endgame.

36:07.810 --> 36:09.238
And that's okay.

36:09.326 --> 36:12.346
Your life is here in Riverdale,
and mine is

36:13.082 --> 36:14.630
somewhere out there.

36:14.725 --> 36:16.032
Who knows where.

36:16.236 --> 36:17.401
Maybe New York.

36:19.856 --> 36:21.237
Well,

36:21.489 --> 36:23.839
I was gonna ask you
to prom, but...

36:26.996 --> 36:29.745
You're too cute for words.

36:42.779 --> 36:44.649
Dad'll be out of jail
in a couple days.

36:44.737 --> 36:46.743
Attorney McCoy cleared
everything with the judge.

36:46.831 --> 36:49.932
Said he was under duress while
he committed the robbery.

36:50.019 --> 36:51.143
Hmm.

36:51.921 --> 36:53.612
That he was.

36:54.417 --> 36:57.673
You know, people are going to
find out what really happened.

36:57.893 --> 36:59.008
About what you did.

36:59.143 --> 37:01.034
How are you gonna
answer for all that?

37:02.292 --> 37:05.221
First thing tomorrow, me
and JB are hitting the road.

37:05.378 --> 37:06.515
No.

37:06.839 --> 37:08.993
She can't keep going
on the run with you.

37:09.081 --> 37:11.253
She deserves
better than that.

37:11.534 --> 37:13.222
She should stay
with Dad and I.

37:22.097 --> 37:23.530
And so should you.

37:25.688 --> 37:26.921
Stay.

37:29.692 --> 37:31.471
Stay, Gladys.

37:33.229 --> 37:34.877
Face the music.

37:35.175 --> 37:37.698
Whatever happens,
let's get through it as a family.

37:38.101 --> 37:39.615
Jughead,

37:39.854 --> 37:43.120
as wonderful
as that all sounds,

37:43.807 --> 37:46.255
it'll probably be best
for everyone

37:46.448 --> 37:48.743
if I just disappear
for a little bit.

37:49.381 --> 37:51.690
Until your dad
cools off a bit.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.128
And then, what?

37:56.136 --> 37:57.979
Maybe we could try again.

38:04.761 --> 38:06.275
Randy's dead.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.944
Mad Dog left my gym.

38:09.237 --> 38:12.348
Casa Grande's reputation's
been called into question.

38:12.565 --> 38:14.517
Don't worry about your gym.

38:14.682 --> 38:16.612
You still have
my financial support.

38:17.104 --> 38:18.550
What about Andrews?

38:18.807 --> 38:21.182
I really thought he was gonna
kill me the other night.

38:21.650 --> 38:23.024
Let me handle him.

38:23.112 --> 38:24.415
What about your truce?

38:24.503 --> 38:26.487
There are two Archie Andrews.

38:26.886 --> 38:28.626
There's the one
who saved my life

38:28.714 --> 38:31.159
at the hospital
after I'd been shot,

38:31.387 --> 38:33.643
And there's the other Archie,

38:33.890 --> 38:36.081
who pointed a gun
at my head.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.370
He was there to kill me.

38:40.034 --> 38:42.198
That's the real
Archie Andrews.

38:42.659 --> 38:44.547
The one with murder
in his heart.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.479
The Riverdale Reaper.

38:48.704 --> 38:49.885
He's done with boxing.

38:49.972 --> 38:52.237
Yeah, with my daughter
in his corner.

38:54.210 --> 38:56.510
We'll see about that.

38:59.814 --> 39:01.914
Archie, get in here,
I need a sparring partner.

39:06.923 --> 39:08.604
Archie.

39:09.455 --> 39:11.112
You need to get back
on the horse soon,

39:11.221 --> 39:12.354
or you never will.

39:12.450 --> 39:14.846
Yeah, well, maybe that's
exactly the way it should be.

39:14.979 --> 39:17.378
I don't want to be known
as the Riverdale Reaper.

39:17.580 --> 39:19.508
You made amends
with the Ronsons

39:19.596 --> 39:21.283
the best way you could.

39:21.370 --> 39:22.985
And, now,

39:23.276 --> 39:25.020
it's time to look
to the future.

39:25.151 --> 39:27.274
You're not
Riverdale's Reaper.

39:28.065 --> 39:29.492
If anything,

39:29.705 --> 39:31.299
you're its Red Hope.

39:35.610 --> 39:37.043
Please.

39:38.429 --> 39:39.829
For me.

39:47.530 --> 39:48.911
Thanks, Ronnie.

39:48.998 --> 39:50.564
Anytime, champ.

40:03.646 --> 40:06.166
Why can't I just
come with you, Mom?

40:06.260 --> 40:08.846
Because I'm gonna be doing
a bunch of dumb work stuff.

40:09.026 --> 40:11.039
Believe me, you're gonna have
so much more fun here

40:11.127 --> 40:12.701
with your dad and Jughead.

40:12.881 --> 40:14.181
Come here.

40:25.282 --> 40:27.479
You take good care
of my babies.

40:27.670 --> 40:28.869
All right?

40:29.939 --> 40:31.287
And yourself.

40:31.479 --> 40:33.284
You too, Gladys.

Betty.

41:11.573 --> 41:12.914
Betty, where have you been?

41:13.002 --> 41:14.846
I've been calling you nonstop.

41:15.451 --> 41:17.127
Why? What's wrong?

41:18.494 --> 41:20.844
Your dad
and a few other inmates

41:20.932 --> 41:23.557
were being transported
to my father's prison,

41:23.645 --> 41:29.119
and... there was
some kind of accident.

41:30.393 --> 41:32.080
Did he escape?

41:33.302 --> 41:34.950
No.

41:35.057 --> 41:36.437
But Betty,

41:37.506 --> 41:39.580
there were no survivors.
