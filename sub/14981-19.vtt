00:02.309 --> 00:04.276
Beato Michaeli archangelo,

00:04.344 --> 00:06.946
beato Ioanni baptistae,

00:07.013 --> 00:10.449
sanctis apostalies
Petro et paolo.

00:10.517 --> 00:12.651
Confiteor deo...

00:15.956 --> 00:17.656
Faye. Charlie.

00:17.724 --> 00:19.024
Dr. Lightman.

00:20.026 --> 00:23.362
I'm sorry about,
um, Dave and sue.

00:23.430 --> 00:26.765
Yeah, to lose their son and
then die in a car crash.

00:26.833 --> 00:29.101
Life is so unfair.

00:29.169 --> 00:31.103
Beato Michaeli archangelo,

00:31.171 --> 00:35.708
sanctis apostalie
Petro et paolo.

00:37.043 --> 00:38.410
It's time.

00:39.612 --> 00:41.380
It's about time
they killed this monster

00:41.448 --> 00:43.015
for what he did to our nephew.

00:43.083 --> 00:46.618
Death by injection's too good for
this unrepentant son of a bitch.

00:46.686 --> 00:49.488
Ah. Well,
what can I say?

00:49.556 --> 00:52.558
Confiteor deo omnipotenti,

00:52.625 --> 00:56.495
beatae Mariae semper virgini.

01:03.003 --> 01:04.769
You ok?

01:04.837 --> 01:07.106
Ah, don't answer that.

01:07.173 --> 01:09.208
I'll shut up now.

01:09.275 --> 01:13.579
...Omnipotenti, beatae
Mariae semper virgini,

01:13.646 --> 01:16.515
beato Michaeli archangelo.

01:37.704 --> 01:39.605
I'm an innocent man.

01:39.672 --> 01:40.906
Go to hell.

01:40.974 --> 01:42.641
The pied piper
was a rat catcher

01:42.709 --> 01:44.576
who was tricked and
didn't get paid.

01:44.644 --> 01:48.747
He stole the children of Hamelin so
the rich would remember the day.

01:50.417 --> 01:53.552
I didn't take little Rex.

01:54.621 --> 01:56.121
The pied piper did.

01:56.189 --> 01:58.457
I need to talk to the governor.

01:58.525 --> 01:59.491
Cal.

01:59.559 --> 02:00.926
Um, no.
You see, he's telling the truth

02:00.994 --> 02:02.995
when he says he didn't take the boy.
Can I speak to the...

02:03.063 --> 02:04.530
have you lost your mind?
Is he on the phone?

02:04.597 --> 02:06.231
Is that the governor on the phone?!
What are you doing?

02:06.299 --> 02:07.699
The governor
can't speak to you.

02:07.767 --> 02:09.735
He can't speak to me, or he
won't speak to me? Come on.

02:09.803 --> 02:12.237
Oh, no. I'm good.
Come on.

For 2 weeks, this guy makes
terrifying phone calls to the family,

02:54.481 --> 02:56.215
kidnaps their 8-year-old son,
and brutally murders him.

02:56.282 --> 02:57.349
He deserves to die.

02:57.417 --> 02:59.318
Big talk is easy when you're
not the executioner.

02:59.385 --> 03:00.619
You think I'm afraid of that?

03:00.687 --> 03:02.688
Show me the switch, I'd
be happy to throw it.

03:02.755 --> 03:04.223
Yeah, well,
it's gross that he's had

03:04.290 --> 03:05.524
3 hots and a cot for 17 years,

03:05.592 --> 03:08.026
but the real issue's
that Jason Wilkie

03:08.094 --> 03:09.628
randomly chose my nephew.

03:09.696 --> 03:11.597
It could have been
anyone's son.

03:11.664 --> 03:12.764
Putting him to death,

03:12.832 --> 03:15.067
I mean, that's about
ensuring public safety

03:15.135 --> 03:16.335
and deterring other crimes.

03:16.402 --> 03:18.637
That was Charlie Sheridan,
uncle of the murder victim,

03:18.705 --> 03:20.005
speaking to us earlier.

03:20.073 --> 03:22.941
Jason Wilkie never confessed
to the kidnapping

03:23.009 --> 03:26.778
and gruesome murder of 8-year-old
Rex Sheridan 17 years ago.

03:26.846 --> 03:28.847
A last-minute
stay of execution

03:28.915 --> 03:30.816
could only come from the
governor of Virginia.

03:30.884 --> 03:32.885
Can't believe
Lightman is in there.

03:32.952 --> 03:34.486
Why is Lightman in there?

03:34.554 --> 03:38.790
It's the first case he worked on that
led to a death-penalty conviction.

03:38.858 --> 03:40.893
Plus there's
the Zoe connection.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.494
This just in.

03:42.562 --> 03:44.730
Jason Wilkie was
just pronounced dead,

03:44.797 --> 03:46.632
the 104th person
to die by execution

03:46.699 --> 03:50.068
in the state of Virginia
since 1976.

03:54.440 --> 03:57.609
Hey. I need the case files
for the Wilkie trial...

03:57.677 --> 03:59.211
the transcripts,
the tapes... the lot.

03:59.279 --> 04:00.212
Go to city hall.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.147
I... I can't.
It'll take too long.

04:02.215 --> 04:04.416
And you kept copies.
I know you did.

04:04.484 --> 04:05.951
You made the paper.

04:06.019 --> 04:07.986
Look, it's over,
Cal. Please,

04:08.054 --> 04:09.721
for both our sakes.

04:09.789 --> 04:13.559
Look, I saw Wilkie lie dozens
of times during his trial,

04:13.626 --> 04:16.928
all right, but last night,
he was telling the truth.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.596
Wait. So you're
telling me,

04:18.665 --> 04:20.098
the woman who prosecuted Wilkie

04:20.166 --> 04:22.201
based in large part
on your science,

04:22.268 --> 04:23.902
is that you got it wrong?

04:23.970 --> 04:25.404
No, I didn't get it wrong.

04:25.471 --> 04:27.239
When? Last night
or 17 years ago?

04:27.307 --> 04:28.440
Both.

04:28.508 --> 04:30.475
How's that possible?

04:30.543 --> 04:33.312
I don't know. That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

04:33.379 --> 04:35.614
I didn't do it, I swear.

04:35.682 --> 04:36.915
Do what?
Oh, good.

04:36.983 --> 04:38.450
I thought you guys
were fighting about me.

04:38.518 --> 04:39.985
No, we're not fighting.
We're just having...

04:40.053 --> 04:41.887
we're not fighting.
We were having a work-related discussion.

04:41.955 --> 04:43.322
Here you are.

04:43.389 --> 04:44.523
Mwah!

04:44.591 --> 04:46.758
So, hey, congrats on
making the paper.

04:46.826 --> 04:49.194
I thought teenagers didn't
read newspapers anymore.

04:49.262 --> 04:51.396
They do when their dad
goes nuts at an execution.

04:51.464 --> 04:53.966
Yeah, well, don't let it
go to your head, all right?

04:54.033 --> 04:55.100
You ready for school?

04:55.168 --> 04:57.035
Uh, yeah.
I forgot to tell you

04:57.103 --> 04:58.437
I don't need a ride.

04:58.504 --> 05:00.739
Hannah's parents
just got her a new Prius...

05:00.807 --> 05:03.008
Hint, hint...
so she's picking me up.

05:05.945 --> 05:08.146
Look, I need those files,
so, please.

05:08.214 --> 05:09.982
I need you to hear something.

05:10.049 --> 05:12.551
Now, this is the call
that Rex Sheridan's parents

05:12.619 --> 05:14.453
received 17 years ago

05:14.520 --> 05:16.221

he was kidnapped.

05:35.708 --> 05:37.309
All right, now get this.

05:37.377 --> 05:38.710
You know Faye and
Charlie Sheridan,

05:38.778 --> 05:41.179
the aunt and uncle of that same
little boy that got murdered?

05:41.247 --> 05:43.749
Well, Mrs. Sheridan
came back home

05:43.816 --> 05:45.684
after taking the kids
to school this morning,

05:45.752 --> 05:48.487
found this message

06:08.007 --> 06:08.940
Oh, my God.

06:09.008 --> 06:10.642
Yeah.

06:10.710 --> 06:12.577
Well, maybe some clown is just

06:12.645 --> 06:14.313
playin' silly buggers, you know,

06:14.380 --> 06:16.682
after watching Wilkie on tv all week.

06:16.749 --> 06:20.052
Well, look at the
sound wave analysis.

06:21.788 --> 06:23.355
This is new FBI software.

06:23.423 --> 06:25.991
Each voice has features as
unique as fingerprints.

06:26.059 --> 06:28.126
The 2 callers are identical,

06:28.194 --> 06:29.628
17 years apart.

06:29.696 --> 06:30.829
This is no copycat.

06:30.897 --> 06:32.664
Do you think that
Jason Wilkie could have

06:32.732 --> 06:34.499
made this recording
before he was arrested?

06:35.835 --> 06:37.703
Well, if the governor had
taken my bloody phone call,

06:37.770 --> 06:39.171
we'd know for sure,
wouldn't we?

06:39.238 --> 06:42.074
Well, doesn't it prove
it wasn't Jason Wilkie?

06:43.476 --> 06:46.278
Did we help execute
an innocent man?

06:53.553 --> 06:55.053
I could do this alone

06:55.121 --> 06:56.321
if you'd prefer.

06:56.389 --> 06:59.491
You think I got the wrong
person 17 years ago.

06:59.559 --> 07:01.593
Don't you?

07:01.661 --> 07:03.128
Yes.

07:03.196 --> 07:06.031
I think you could have
made a mistake.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.101
So do you.

07:09.168 --> 07:12.337
Zoe was a young prosecutor

07:12.405 --> 07:14.272
eager to get a conviction,

07:14.340 --> 07:16.441
and you wanted to help her.

07:16.509 --> 07:17.442
You still do.

07:17.510 --> 07:20.112
Do you charge
by the hour for this?

07:20.179 --> 07:22.047
Classic. Deflection.

07:23.349 --> 07:25.450
Classic Cal Lightman.

07:25.518 --> 07:28.720
No, look. I saw a man
executed last night.

07:28.788 --> 07:30.088
Go on.

07:30.156 --> 07:33.725
Well, I... I saw something on his
face I'd never seen before.

07:33.793 --> 07:35.527
Well, what did you see then?

07:35.595 --> 07:38.363
Um, well, I don't really
know what it was.

07:38.431 --> 07:41.133
But you need to follow it
to the ends of the earth,

07:41.200 --> 07:42.501
no matter what, knowing you.

07:44.904 --> 07:46.338
All right.

07:46.406 --> 07:47.773
Come on, then.

07:52.879 --> 07:54.780
Have you reached your children?

07:54.847 --> 07:56.782
Abby and Brady are upstairs.

07:56.849 --> 07:58.817
Our oldest son, Oliver,

07:58.885 --> 08:00.185
he's driving back
to college in Baltimore.

08:00.253 --> 08:01.953
We haven't been able
to reach him yet,

08:02.021 --> 08:04.222
but the FBI
is waiting for him there.

08:04.290 --> 08:06.258
Oh, my God.
Brady just turned 8.

08:06.325 --> 08:09.261
Rex was 8 when he was abducted.

08:10.363 --> 08:12.497
Vinyl, still the best, eh?

08:12.565 --> 08:13.832
It's brilliant.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.367
It's the best.

08:15.435 --> 08:17.936
The heavy metal piece,
that's fantastic there.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.008
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

08:24.477 --> 08:26.344
I thought you might
have had a safe.

08:26.412 --> 08:28.413
That sign means a lot to us.

08:28.481 --> 08:29.481
Oh, really?

08:29.549 --> 08:30.816
The home fed diner

08:30.883 --> 08:33.118
is the first property
my father purchased.

08:33.186 --> 08:35.320
Oh. No offense
intended.

08:35.388 --> 08:36.755
So where's the tape?

08:36.823 --> 08:38.523
What tape?

08:38.591 --> 08:40.091
The one that you
used to fake the...

08:40.159 --> 08:41.293
the voice mail you just got,

08:41.360 --> 08:42.360
one from 17 years ago,

08:42.428 --> 08:43.761
the creepy nursery rhyme tape.

08:43.830 --> 08:45.397
That one.
Where is it?

08:46.332 --> 08:48.567
You think we faked
that message?

08:50.102 --> 08:53.038
Oh. Alphabetized books.

08:54.106 --> 08:56.775
Ah, that's a red flag
if ever I saw one.

08:56.843 --> 08:59.411
Hey. Wait a minute!

09:00.646 --> 09:03.648
Charlie, you got a little
quiet all of a sudden,

09:03.716 --> 09:06.051
you know, for someone who's
got such a loud mouth.

09:06.118 --> 09:07.719
You can't come in here and...

09:07.787 --> 09:08.820
no, that message that you claim

09:08.888 --> 09:09.888
you got, that was a hoax.

09:09.956 --> 09:12.157
I mean, you've been
on tv for years.

09:12.225 --> 09:14.626
You've made a career out of
getting Jason Wilkie executed.

09:14.694 --> 09:16.528
Well, now he's been
done, hasn't he?

09:16.596 --> 09:19.831
So how are you gonna
maintain your victim status?

09:20.833 --> 09:22.133
What's wrong with you?

09:22.201 --> 09:25.203
First Wilkie did it.
Then he didn't. Now this?

09:25.271 --> 09:27.305
Either you enjoy
inflicting emotional pain,

09:27.373 --> 09:29.508
or you're a complete fraud,
Dr. Lightman.

09:34.013 --> 09:35.614
Well, you're right.

09:36.983 --> 09:38.049
Sorry.

09:38.117 --> 09:41.520
I'm... I'm sorry about
the books, yeah,

09:41.587 --> 09:44.923
but sometimes you have to use
a pickax to get at the truth,

09:44.991 --> 09:46.258
you know what I mean?

09:46.325 --> 09:47.592
You may work with the FBI,

09:47.660 --> 09:49.327
but I want you out of my house.

09:49.395 --> 09:50.996
I understand

09:51.063 --> 09:52.564
completely.

09:52.632 --> 09:55.534
The FBI initially had 4 other
suspects besides Jason Wilkie...

09:55.601 --> 09:57.502
a school bus driver,
a homeless man,

09:57.570 --> 09:59.471
a phone company repairman,
and a supervisor.

09:59.539 --> 10:02.307
You know, they never pinpointed
the actual source of the calls.

10:02.375 --> 10:04.175
Couldn't trace 'em
for some reason.

10:04.243 --> 10:05.944
Does Lightman
seem weird to you?

10:06.012 --> 10:08.046
Uh, well, he's rude,
impatient, distant.

10:08.114 --> 10:09.881
He seems pretty normal to me.

10:09.949 --> 10:11.383
Yeah, but isn't that weird?

10:11.450 --> 10:13.618
He may have helped execute
an innocent man,

10:13.686 --> 10:15.287
and he has
no emotional reaction.

10:15.354 --> 10:17.022
Doesn't that make him
a sociopath?

10:17.089 --> 10:18.690
Or it's just a mask.

10:18.758 --> 10:21.326
Where is he?
I know he's here.

10:21.394 --> 10:22.994
Dr. Lightman's
at a meeting across town.

10:23.062 --> 10:24.362
Can I help you,
Mr. Wilkie?

10:24.430 --> 10:25.463
Dr. Lightman lied

10:25.531 --> 10:27.966
back when he said Jason
committed that crime.

10:28.034 --> 10:30.101
You turned Jason in
to the authorities.

10:30.169 --> 10:32.571
Because I thought he might
be involved somehow.

10:32.638 --> 10:34.439
Dr. Lightman is the one
who said he was sure.

10:34.507 --> 10:36.007
He's the one
who convinced the jury

10:36.075 --> 10:37.442
to put my brother on death row.

10:37.510 --> 10:39.811
The facts of this case
have not changed.

10:39.879 --> 10:40.946
The calls are happening again.

10:41.013 --> 10:42.314
I saw it on the news.

10:42.381 --> 10:44.115
The real killer is still alive,

10:44.183 --> 10:48.320
and Jason
I-is dead now, and...

10:48.387 --> 10:50.689
what have I done?

10:50.756 --> 10:53.091
Sir, why don't we go sit down?

10:53.159 --> 10:54.426
No. Listen.

10:54.493 --> 10:57.028
You tell Lightman
that I am suing his ass

10:57.096 --> 11:00.665
and the state of Virginia in the
wrongful death of my brother.

11:02.668 --> 11:05.403
All right, Faye, we got
this whole system set up

11:05.471 --> 11:08.773
so that when your home phone
rings, it'll ring here as well.

11:08.841 --> 11:10.408
Which will keep me
out of your hair.

11:10.476 --> 11:12.010
Now, look,
if another call comes in,

11:12.078 --> 11:13.878
don't panic, ok?
Just stick with the script

11:13.946 --> 11:15.547
that Dr. Foster's
wrote out for you.

11:15.615 --> 11:16.615
Let's rehearse again.

11:19.485 --> 11:20.852
Is that him?

11:28.160 --> 11:29.427
Hello.

11:29.495 --> 11:32.097
Mrs. Sheridan,
it's Noah Benson.

11:32.164 --> 11:34.132
It's my son's roommate.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.635
Noah, is everything all right?

11:36.702 --> 11:39.404
Um, an FBI agent is here
looking for Oliver.

11:39.472 --> 11:43.441
He's still not here yet, and
no one knows where he is.

11:50.833 --> 11:51.766
So Oliver was auditioning

11:51.834 --> 11:54.534
for the men of Fincher
college calendar.

11:54.602 --> 11:56.169
We found a schedule
on his computer.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.338
He, uh, had an appointment with
a photographer this afternoon,

11:58.406 --> 12:00.674
which may have been the last
person to have seen him.

12:00.741 --> 12:03.977
What aren't you
telling me, Ben?

12:04.045 --> 12:06.379
Look, there's a lot of people

12:06.447 --> 12:08.048
down at headquarters
that don't think

12:08.116 --> 12:09.850
you should be involved
in this case.

12:09.917 --> 12:12.352
Why? Because it's
too personal?

12:12.420 --> 12:15.422
Or, uh, 'cause they think
I've lost my marbles?

12:15.490 --> 12:19.759
Or that I've already made a mistake
and got an innocent man executed?

12:19.827 --> 12:21.294
They didn't say that.
Yeah, but you did.

12:21.362 --> 12:22.395
Right there.

12:22.463 --> 12:23.964
Look, I'm not the enemy
here, Lightman.

12:24.031 --> 12:25.465
Really?

12:25.533 --> 12:26.600
Really.

12:26.667 --> 12:28.101
Prove it.

12:34.275 --> 12:37.344
Oliver Sheridan was here
for about, uh, 30 minutes.

12:37.411 --> 12:40.013
Do you have any idea
where he went?

12:40.081 --> 12:41.148
None.

12:41.215 --> 12:45.085
See, I was expecting
lads in varsity jackets,

12:45.153 --> 12:46.920
not meat and 2 veg.

12:46.988 --> 12:48.788
Yeah, well, that's what sells.

12:48.856 --> 12:50.390
Yeah. Fair enough.

12:50.458 --> 12:51.858
So where's your pictures
of Oliver, then?

12:51.926 --> 12:55.128
Uh, it's on the second
shelf, red folder.

12:55.196 --> 12:57.063
I'm on a deadline here.

12:57.932 --> 13:00.534
Right.

13:00.601 --> 13:01.768
No. No, no, no.

13:01.836 --> 13:04.037
He's... he's dressed
like an eskimo here.

13:04.105 --> 13:05.639
Um, where's your calendar pics?

13:05.706 --> 13:07.574
Look, just 'cause a guy
is good-lookin'

13:07.642 --> 13:09.676
doesn't mean the camera's
gonna love him.

13:09.744 --> 13:12.445
So how did he handle
this rejection, then?

13:12.513 --> 13:15.348
He was disappointed,
but he took it well.

13:19.754 --> 13:22.355
Well, you... you can't open that
without a search warrant.

13:22.423 --> 13:24.057
Really?

13:24.125 --> 13:26.593
I tell you what.
If you're not ashamed

13:26.661 --> 13:27.827
of anything in there,

13:27.895 --> 13:30.463
all right, you can
call the cops.

13:30.531 --> 13:31.498
Yeah.

13:31.566 --> 13:33.066
Didn't think so.

13:33.134 --> 13:35.802
Just stop him.

13:35.870 --> 13:37.737
What do you got there?

13:37.805 --> 13:39.406
"Young beach studs."

13:39.473 --> 13:40.440
Huh.

13:40.508 --> 13:42.209
"Fraternity fun."

13:42.276 --> 13:44.277
Uh, "21 and hot."

13:44.345 --> 13:45.378
It's research.

13:45.446 --> 13:47.914
All right, I win.
You owe me 10 bucks.

13:47.982 --> 13:49.749
See, whenever anyone says, uh,

13:49.817 --> 13:51.418
"it's for research," I win.

13:51.485 --> 13:53.820
Um, if... if they say,
"that's not mine,"

13:53.888 --> 13:55.355
then he wins, so cough up.

13:55.423 --> 13:56.356
There you go.

13:56.424 --> 13:57.691
Thank you very much.
Congrats.

13:57.758 --> 13:59.159
I think that
this calendar thing,

13:59.227 --> 14:01.328
I think it's just
an excuse for you

14:01.395 --> 14:03.697
to get young men naked
in your apartment.

14:03.764 --> 14:04.731
I run a business.

14:04.799 --> 14:05.665
Really?

14:05.733 --> 14:07.667
What's the matter
with your leg?

14:07.735 --> 14:09.002
What?

14:09.070 --> 14:10.370
You heard me.

14:10.438 --> 14:12.405
Nothing.

14:12.473 --> 14:14.341
Aah! Jeez!

14:14.408 --> 14:15.842
God!

14:15.910 --> 14:16.776
Ouch.

14:16.844 --> 14:19.246
Liar. Let's look at it.

14:19.313 --> 14:21.114
Ah! Heh heh.

14:21.182 --> 14:23.049
I fell.

14:23.117 --> 14:25.885
See, I think you
got fresh with Oliver.

14:25.953 --> 14:28.121
He rejected you.
You got angry...

14:28.189 --> 14:29.723
And violent.

14:29.790 --> 14:31.291
So what happened?
Did you kill him?

14:31.359 --> 14:33.526
Look, he's the one
who got violent.

14:33.594 --> 14:34.761
I rubbed his shoulder,

14:34.829 --> 14:37.664
and he hit me with
a golf club and left.

14:37.732 --> 14:39.766
Do you know where he was going?

14:41.502 --> 14:43.003
Oh, that's a no.

14:43.070 --> 14:45.071
Ah, come on.
You're fishing for a job.

14:45.139 --> 14:48.808
Why, because Jack Rader's made it clear
that he appreciates my research,

14:48.876 --> 14:50.110
that I'm welcome there,

14:50.177 --> 14:52.712
and I have the most leverage
with him now?

14:52.780 --> 14:54.714
Let's face it.
This ship is sinking.

14:54.782 --> 14:56.182
So the rats flee.

14:56.250 --> 14:59.653
Well, you know, news of Lightman's
mistake is already out there,

14:59.720 --> 15:01.454
and once this lawsuit is filed,

15:01.522 --> 15:02.622
this company is finished.

15:02.690 --> 15:05.225
Even if we win,
it'll be too late.

15:05.293 --> 15:06.626
Lightman's reputation'll
be destroyed.

15:06.694 --> 15:08.895
Ours'll be damaged
alongside it.

15:08.963 --> 15:10.563
What about...
what about loyalty?

15:10.631 --> 15:14.200
Well, you know, the way Lightman
insults me on a daily basis,

15:14.268 --> 15:16.036
blind loyalty would
just be self-loathing.

15:16.103 --> 15:20.106
And the best time to look for a
job is when you already have one.

15:20.174 --> 15:23.143
I need you to pull up
Jason Wilkie's final words.

15:26.047 --> 15:28.181
The pied piper
was a rat catcher

15:28.249 --> 15:30.617
who was tricked and
didn't get paid.

15:30.685 --> 15:34.287
He stole the children of Hamelin so
the rich would remember the day.

15:34.355 --> 15:35.855
I didn't take little Rex.

15:35.923 --> 15:37.524
The pied piper did.

15:38.559 --> 15:39.959
There are theories
that the pied piper

15:40.027 --> 15:41.127
is the symbol of death,

15:41.195 --> 15:43.163
that the fairy tale
was concocted

15:43.230 --> 15:45.365
to explain a horrible tragedy
where children died.

15:45.433 --> 15:46.933
Any news about Oliver Sheridan?

15:47.001 --> 15:48.368
He's unaccounted for,

15:48.436 --> 15:50.937
but that doesn't definitely
mean that he's been kidnapped.

15:51.005 --> 15:52.405
You don't believe that.

15:53.541 --> 15:56.276
Do you expect us to just
share this delusion

15:56.344 --> 15:57.410
that Lightman is infallible?

15:57.478 --> 15:59.546
That Jason Wilkie might
not have been innocent?

15:59.613 --> 16:03.149
Without Lightman, you'd be in some
university basement doing research,

16:03.217 --> 16:05.418
and you'd still be
a glorified baggage handler.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.454
Maybe instead of
polishing up your résumés,

16:07.521 --> 16:10.924
you ought to think about what
you can do to help Lightman.

16:14.862 --> 16:16.396
Zoe.

16:16.464 --> 16:17.864
Uh, Cal's not here.

16:17.932 --> 16:20.767
Um, actually,
I came to talk to you.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.137
I'm worried about Cal.

16:24.205 --> 16:28.108
He seems to be handling
things in his own unique way.

16:28.175 --> 16:30.910
He won't even speak
to me about the case.

16:30.978 --> 16:33.380
He won't even
return my phone calls.

16:35.483 --> 16:38.718
I was hoping you could
talk to him, Gillian.

16:40.087 --> 16:44.791
You were the only one
who could always get through.

16:44.859 --> 16:47.894
That's funny. I always
thought that about you.

16:47.962 --> 16:48.928
Heh.

16:52.433 --> 16:57.404
The truth is there's probably only
one person that can reach him.

16:58.305 --> 16:59.339
I can fly over the moon.

17:00.408 --> 17:02.542
I can fly over the moon, ok?

17:02.610 --> 17:04.444
I... I can swim
under the sea.

17:04.512 --> 17:07.146
The only one I tell
my secrets to is Beth.

17:08.449 --> 17:10.049
My poodle.

17:11.819 --> 17:13.685
Right.

17:15.021 --> 17:16.756
Hey.
Hey.

17:16.824 --> 17:18.657
What's going on?

17:18.726 --> 17:20.026
Nothin'.

17:20.094 --> 17:22.694
So Foster sent you over here
to check on me, did she?

17:22.762 --> 17:24.464
Mm-hmm, yeah. Her and mom.

17:24.531 --> 17:26.398
Oh.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.735
You tell 'em I'm fine.

17:29.837 --> 17:32.639
Actually, I need to talk
to you about mom.

17:32.706 --> 17:36.543
She's been acting,
uh, depressed lately,

17:36.610 --> 17:38.011
different.

17:38.078 --> 17:39.479
Well...

17:39.547 --> 17:41.314
She is.

17:43.017 --> 17:45.185
But she's a strong woman.

17:45.252 --> 17:46.386
She'll get through it.

17:46.454 --> 17:48.621
I mean, I know what's going on.

17:48.689 --> 17:52.392
I know it has to do with that
Wilkie guy who was executed.

17:52.460 --> 17:55.094
Yeah. She thinks we might
have made a mistake,

17:55.162 --> 17:56.262
he might be innocent.

17:56.330 --> 17:58.832
Well, was he?

18:00.668 --> 18:02.769
I don't know.

18:02.837 --> 18:04.904
We can rule out
the homeless man

18:04.972 --> 18:07.040
and the phone repairman
based on the old videos,

18:07.107 --> 18:09.209
but we're still looking
at the school bus driver

18:09.276 --> 18:10.443
and the phone company
supervisor.

18:10.511 --> 18:11.811
Well, the problem
with all these

18:11.879 --> 18:13.179
old suspects is lack of motive.

18:13.247 --> 18:15.114
I mean, this...
whoever did this

18:15.182 --> 18:17.317
is probably a raving
lunatic anyway, so...

18:17.384 --> 18:19.652
Hey! I found something in
Wilkie's old interview, right?

18:19.720 --> 18:24.257
He's trying to sound crazy 'cause he's
trying to get off on an insanity plea,

18:24.325 --> 18:25.425
but when he says

18:25.493 --> 18:28.261
he only tells his secrets
to his poodle, Beth,

18:28.329 --> 18:29.696
he's not fakin' it.

18:29.763 --> 18:30.997
He had an ex-girlfriend.

18:31.065 --> 18:33.132
Her name was Beth Lansford.

18:33.200 --> 18:36.369
I think maybe he tells
his secrets to her.

18:36.437 --> 18:37.637
Beth's the key.

18:37.705 --> 18:39.305
Any idea where she is?

18:39.373 --> 18:41.307
Yeah. I spoke
to her mum.

18:41.375 --> 18:44.143
She signed into a psychiatric
hospital 2 days ago,

18:44.211 --> 18:45.678
which is a bit of a
coincidence, don't you think?

18:45.746 --> 18:47.113
Cal, let me give it
to you straight, ok,

18:47.181 --> 18:48.548
'cause you don't
seem to get it.

18:48.616 --> 18:52.318
Nobody cares about Wilkie's
dog or his ex-girlfriend.

18:52.386 --> 18:53.419
Excuse me?

18:53.487 --> 18:54.954
You're off this case,

18:55.022 --> 18:57.390
and this comes from the top.

18:58.859 --> 18:59.893
That's the Sheridan home phone.

19:01.028 --> 19:03.463
You might wanna get that.

19:08.869 --> 19:10.069
Hello.

19:10.137 --> 19:13.473
What's green and
red and goes really fast?

19:13.541 --> 19:14.541
Frog in a blender.

19:14.608 --> 19:18.578
A frog in a blender.

19:19.780 --> 19:22.048
You have a really
beautiful voice.

19:22.116 --> 19:27.220
You remind me of my son Oliver
when he was a little boy.

19:27.288 --> 19:28.988
He loves riddles, too,

19:29.056 --> 19:31.491
um, and baseball and ice cream.

19:31.559 --> 19:33.793
Good. Good. She keeps
humanizing the victim.

19:33.861 --> 19:35.595
What's your name?

19:35.663 --> 19:38.631
Do you wanna know
where Oliver is?

19:38.699 --> 19:40.133
I do.

19:42.603 --> 19:45.071
Yes, I do.
I miss him very much.

19:45.139 --> 19:49.309
Then tell me how you play
the game bloody murder.

19:51.078 --> 19:55.281
You get in a circle with
everyone, and then you...

19:55.349 --> 19:56.349
that's wrong.

20:03.324 --> 20:04.591
Ah, damn it.

20:04.658 --> 20:07.160
The call's comin' up
as if it's comin'

20:07.227 --> 20:09.329
from 300 different cell
phone numbers in Virginia.

20:09.396 --> 20:10.330
We'll never get a trace.

20:10.397 --> 20:11.331
I'm gonna see Beth.

20:11.398 --> 20:12.699
Go home, Lightman.
I'm serious.

20:12.766 --> 20:15.068
You try and do anything
related to this case,

20:15.135 --> 20:16.603
and the FBI will drop the
entire Lightman group.

20:16.670 --> 20:19.939
And quite frankly, you're startin'
to sound a little insane.

20:20.007 --> 20:21.874
Really?

20:21.942 --> 20:23.076
Really.

20:23.143 --> 20:25.411
I was hopin' you'd say that.

20:25.479 --> 20:26.980
He's a bully,
and he's a racist.

20:27.047 --> 20:30.049
And just 'cause he's in the FBI
doesn't make him a God, right?

20:30.117 --> 20:32.118
Besides, they're telling me
to do him in, so...

20:32.186 --> 20:34.454
The, uh, voices?

20:34.521 --> 20:35.888
Yeah. What,
you can't hear 'em?

20:35.956 --> 20:39.325
And they're actually
telling you to kill him?

20:39.393 --> 20:42.495
Yeah. Under a bus or, you know,
just shoot him. Whatever.

20:42.563 --> 20:43.796
Do you own a gun?

20:43.864 --> 20:45.498
Oh, yeah, I do.
Course I do.

20:45.566 --> 20:47.634
Yeah, it's my right.
Yeah. Second amendment.

20:49.670 --> 20:51.738
And what's this
FBI agent's name?

20:51.805 --> 20:52.739
Why?

20:52.806 --> 20:53.940
What, you gonna
warn him, are you?

20:54.008 --> 20:55.008
Heh heh.

20:55.075 --> 20:57.644
Look, the point is
that I'm the victim here.

20:57.711 --> 21:01.214
He's walking around.
He's telling everyone I'm a psycho, all right?

21:01.281 --> 21:03.750
When he's the one
that's driving me crazy.

21:03.817 --> 21:07.153
Look, just calm down.
I'm dealing with it, all right?

21:07.221 --> 21:10.256
I would like you
to, uh, stay with us

21:10.324 --> 21:11.924
for a while,
Mr. Stein.

21:11.992 --> 21:14.694
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
I just came here to get those...

21:14.762 --> 21:17.030
you know, those little white pills,
the ones that help you sleep.

21:17.097 --> 21:20.333
I'm afraid I have to
hold you for 72 hours

21:20.401 --> 21:22.669
for, uh, being
a danger to others.

21:22.736 --> 21:24.203
Can I have jello?

21:40.011 --> 21:41.778
No cheekin' your meds, Beth.

21:41.846 --> 21:44.214
Let me see you swallow 'em.

21:45.383 --> 21:47.183
Good. Thank you.

21:47.251 --> 21:48.184
Right, Professor.

21:48.252 --> 21:49.653
Morning, Stein.

21:49.720 --> 21:51.655
Steen.

21:51.722 --> 21:53.490
Steen.

21:55.826 --> 21:58.828
What do you got?

22:06.604 --> 22:08.071
Cheer up, Ralph.

22:11.776 --> 22:15.812
It's a cheery place, this, isn't it?
Laugh a minute.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.782
What are you in for?
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.

22:18.849 --> 22:21.518
OCD? Panic attacks?

22:21.585 --> 22:23.353
Agoraphobia.

22:24.388 --> 22:25.789
Nymphomania.

22:25.856 --> 22:28.958
I am suicidal.
Now leave me alone.

22:29.026 --> 22:29.993
Oh! Suicide.

22:30.061 --> 22:32.662
I know a thing or two
about suicide

22:32.730 --> 22:36.399
from, you know, an intimate
perspective, you might say.

22:36.467 --> 22:38.268
Mind if I join you?

22:44.909 --> 22:49.345
Did you know Jason Wilkie
named his poodle after you?

22:50.214 --> 22:52.348
Who the hell are you?

22:52.416 --> 22:54.818
Me? I'm just another nut case
lookin' for answers, love.

22:54.885 --> 22:56.853
Hey, hey, hey.
Nurse.

22:56.921 --> 22:59.355
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, you don't wanna do that.

22:59.423 --> 23:02.392
If you call for help, I
will bust your little game.

23:02.460 --> 23:03.727
Game?

23:03.794 --> 23:05.095
You're not suicidal.

23:05.162 --> 23:06.730
You're not even depressed.

23:06.797 --> 23:09.199
What you are is scared.

23:09.266 --> 23:11.167
You're scared for your life.

23:11.235 --> 23:13.336
That's why you're
hidin' out in here.

23:13.404 --> 23:14.771
You don't know
what you're talking about.

23:14.839 --> 23:15.772
Yeah, I do.

23:15.840 --> 23:18.308
I do.

23:18.375 --> 23:20.110
You're in the paranoid chair.

23:20.177 --> 23:22.345
It's... it's the best seat
in the house, really,

23:22.413 --> 23:25.081
'cause no one
can sneak up on you.

23:25.149 --> 23:27.817
See, depressives, they
retreat into themselves,

23:27.885 --> 23:31.254
but you, you're watchin' everybody.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.355
What's your point?

23:32.423 --> 23:34.691
My point is that you
checked in here

23:34.759 --> 23:36.192
the day that Wilkie
was executed.

23:36.260 --> 23:37.861
Right?

23:39.230 --> 23:40.897
Nothin'?

23:40.965 --> 23:42.899
Really? What,
you all right now?

23:42.967 --> 23:44.334
Nurse!

23:44.401 --> 23:46.236
Nurse, I've got... I got
something to tell you.

23:46.303 --> 23:47.971
No. No, it's o...
uh, I'll...

23:48.038 --> 23:50.140
I'll tell you
what you wanna know.

23:52.109 --> 23:54.010
Can I trouble you for a latte?

23:55.780 --> 23:57.947
That's a bit rude, isn't it?

23:59.183 --> 24:00.483
You were sayin'?

24:04.121 --> 24:09.125
A couple of days ago, I got a call
from an old friend of Jason's.

24:09.193 --> 24:11.294
He said he was watching me,

24:11.362 --> 24:13.830
that people
might ask questions.

24:13.898 --> 24:18.735
He said if I said anything
about him and Jason,

24:18.803 --> 24:22.505
he would hunt me down
and kill me.

24:22.573 --> 24:23.907
Who was he?

24:23.974 --> 24:26.176
I don't know his real name.

24:26.243 --> 24:28.945
Jason called him...

24:29.013 --> 24:31.648
What? What'd he call him?

24:34.451 --> 24:35.752
The pied piper.

24:35.820 --> 24:37.687
The pied piper.

24:40.090 --> 24:43.459
How did Jason know him,
this pied piper character?

24:43.527 --> 24:46.930
He said that they met as kids

24:46.997 --> 24:50.300
when they were at some
summer music camp.

24:51.168 --> 24:52.202
Now, look, I just...

24:52.269 --> 24:54.304
I had one lager
too many last night.

24:54.371 --> 24:56.306
I've called my friend.
We're all square,

24:56.373 --> 24:58.041
so I'm ready to be released.

24:58.108 --> 25:00.844
And what about the voices
telling you to kill him?

25:00.911 --> 25:03.713
What voices?
Nah, that was just the beer talking.

25:03.781 --> 25:05.782
You don't believe me, do you?

25:05.850 --> 25:07.217
Well, Mr. Stein, uh...

25:07.284 --> 25:08.484
Steen.

25:08.552 --> 25:11.721
Steen. This is what we call
a flight to recovery.

25:11.789 --> 25:12.889
It's always short-lived.

25:12.957 --> 25:15.892
Look, doctor, I do not
have a mental illness.

25:15.960 --> 25:16.960
Terrific.
Truly.

25:17.027 --> 25:20.296
Well, if you still
don't have one in 2 days,

25:20.364 --> 25:21.598
you'll be discharged.

25:38.983 --> 25:41.618
Well, it was worth a try.

25:41.685 --> 25:43.853
So we found Oliver's
car in a ditch off route 4.

25:43.921 --> 25:46.956
Looks like somebody may
have run him off the road.

25:47.024 --> 25:48.424
We found this nearby.

25:49.360 --> 25:50.860
That's Oliver's
favorite jacket.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.546
Hello.

26:10.614 --> 26:15.885
What feeds
on human blood 5 times a day?

26:19.056 --> 26:23.426
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

26:23.494 --> 26:24.794
Lice.

26:24.862 --> 26:27.463
What insects fly alone
in the dark?

26:28.599 --> 26:30.400
Do you give up?

26:31.635 --> 26:33.136
Locusts.

26:33.203 --> 26:34.570
Please, where's Oliver?

26:34.638 --> 26:39.342
I know, but you don't.

26:40.811 --> 26:43.212
What makes you think
I can break this hold?

26:43.280 --> 26:45.214
Well, you're the lawyer.
You tell me.

26:45.282 --> 26:47.650
Well, you got into this mess
by threatening violence.

26:47.718 --> 26:49.552
You could have always
checked in voluntarily.

26:49.620 --> 26:52.422
No, I needed to be on the locked
ward so I could talk to Beth.

26:52.489 --> 26:53.990
When she mentioned
the pied piper, she was

26:54.058 --> 26:56.759
talking about a real person, so
now I need to get out of here.

26:56.827 --> 26:59.028
Well, you could call
Foster and Reynolds.

26:59.096 --> 27:00.697
They could always handle it.

27:00.764 --> 27:03.366
I already used up my phone
privilege when I called you.

27:04.301 --> 27:06.436
So are you gonna help me
or what?

27:06.503 --> 27:08.338
No.

27:09.640 --> 27:10.940
Though I find it fascinating

27:11.008 --> 27:12.976
that you feel like I'm the
only one you can call,

27:13.043 --> 27:14.978
and yet we can't even have
a real adult conversation.

27:15.045 --> 27:16.179
Right.
What do you wanna know?

27:16.246 --> 27:20.183
Why don't you try telling
me how you really feel?

27:22.353 --> 27:25.221
All right. I'm, um...

27:25.289 --> 27:27.790
I'm upset,

27:27.858 --> 27:29.092
and I'm scared,

27:29.159 --> 27:34.397
and I'm really,
really, really rattled.

27:35.265 --> 27:36.199
I give up.

27:36.266 --> 27:37.700
What, you actually
want me to try

27:37.768 --> 27:39.502
to convince the doctor
that you're not insane?

27:39.570 --> 27:41.904
Well, it's worth a shot, right?

27:48.022 --> 27:49.923
Locust and darkness.

27:49.991 --> 27:52.359
None of this is random.
He has a plan.

27:52.427 --> 27:55.996
Also, he got angry when Faye didn't
know the rules to bloody murder.

27:56.064 --> 27:58.265
He's controlling and
very detail-oriented.

27:58.333 --> 27:59.900
It's the 10 plagues.

27:59.967 --> 28:03.270
Frogs, lice, locusts,
blood, darkness.

28:03.338 --> 28:05.472
And the death of firstborn sons.
Yeah.

28:05.540 --> 28:07.441
Rex was the eldest.
So is Oliver.

28:07.508 --> 28:09.743
All right, everybody, give
us 5 minutes, ok, please?

28:09.811 --> 28:11.511
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

28:13.047 --> 28:16.249
You know, speaking of lunatics,

28:16.317 --> 28:17.651
when I said you sounded insane,

28:17.719 --> 28:20.220
I didn't mean for you to go check
into a psych ward. I know.

28:20.288 --> 28:21.922
You went to see Wilkie's
ex-girlfriend, didn't you?

28:21.989 --> 28:22.856
Yeah.

28:22.924 --> 28:24.491
I couldn't resist it.

28:24.559 --> 28:26.560
It turns out...

28:27.662 --> 28:29.096
Wilkie's not workin'
on his own.

28:29.163 --> 28:30.597
All right, the pied piper

28:30.665 --> 28:32.466
is a nickname
for a real person.

28:32.533 --> 28:34.835
They went to music camp together.

28:34.902 --> 28:36.169
In the... the fairy tale,

28:36.237 --> 28:39.406
the pied piper plays
some sort of flute or clarinet.

28:39.474 --> 28:42.142
Maybe that's what
he played at music camp.

28:42.210 --> 28:43.744
Well, you know, whoever it is,

28:43.811 --> 28:45.512
he's got all the answers.

28:46.381 --> 28:47.581
You do know

28:47.648 --> 28:50.917
that I'm not gonna just
walk away from this.

28:51.786 --> 28:53.587
So tell the bureau to fire me

28:53.654 --> 28:55.188
and to find another
Lightman group.

28:55.256 --> 28:57.057
Good luck on that, by the way.

28:57.125 --> 28:58.692
Just be right this time.

28:58.760 --> 29:01.027
I'll do my level best.

29:07.969 --> 29:09.069
You ok?

29:09.137 --> 29:11.738
Yeah, I'm fantastic.

29:11.806 --> 29:14.040
I'm here if you need me.

29:14.108 --> 29:15.375
You know that, right?

29:15.443 --> 29:16.710
Right.

29:18.146 --> 29:19.980
I know that, love.

29:26.721 --> 29:27.954
Oh. Hello.

29:28.022 --> 29:31.224
So mom has some pictures laid
out from the Wilkie trial,

29:31.292 --> 29:33.260
a few months
after you guys met.

29:33.327 --> 29:35.429
She's looking a little
rounder than usual.

29:35.496 --> 29:36.930
And?

29:36.998 --> 29:38.765
And we've never really
discussed it before,

29:38.833 --> 29:40.567
but I'm pretty good at math.

29:41.469 --> 29:42.702
Your point being?

29:42.770 --> 29:45.906
I was born 7 1/2 months
after you guys married.

29:45.973 --> 29:50.510
Would you believe
that you were premature?

29:50.578 --> 29:52.679
At 8 pounds, 8 ounces?

29:52.747 --> 29:55.615
No, your mum was pregnant
when I married her.

29:55.683 --> 29:58.118
But you couldn't have just
come out and told me that?

29:58.186 --> 30:00.153
No. No, we didn't want to
celebrate our mistakes,

30:00.221 --> 30:01.788
have you go on and copy 'em.

30:01.856 --> 30:02.889
Oh, so I was a mistake?

30:02.957 --> 30:04.024
Course not.

30:04.091 --> 30:06.226
So how'd it happen?

30:06.294 --> 30:07.227
Were... were you drunk?

30:07.295 --> 30:09.229
Was it just
a one-night stand?

30:09.297 --> 30:11.565
Did you even
go on a date first?

30:11.632 --> 30:15.969
Yes, no, and yes.

30:16.037 --> 30:18.271
What's the matter, em?

30:18.339 --> 30:21.608
Did you only marry mom
because you got her pregnant?

30:21.676 --> 30:23.577
No. No, of course not.

30:23.644 --> 30:25.312
I'm not that much
of a gentleman.

30:25.379 --> 30:26.246
No, be serious.

30:26.314 --> 30:28.348
I wanna know if I'm the reason

30:28.416 --> 30:30.617
you guys spent
14 miserable years together.

30:32.386 --> 30:34.454
Look, I married your mum

30:34.522 --> 30:35.856
because I loved her.

30:35.923 --> 30:39.259
Then you comin' along just
helped me pull the trigger.

30:39.327 --> 30:44.397
Plus they were by no means
14 miserable years.

30:45.933 --> 30:50.604
So I didn't, like... like, ruin
your life or something like that?

30:50.671 --> 30:54.608
Ah, no, you were the best
news I ever got, yeah?

30:54.675 --> 30:56.610
Still are.

30:57.478 --> 30:59.012
So you were drunk.

30:59.080 --> 30:59.946
Yeah.

31:00.014 --> 31:01.681
It wasn't
a one-night stand.

31:01.749 --> 31:02.682
No.

31:02.750 --> 31:03.984
And you were dating.

31:04.051 --> 31:04.951
Yeah.

31:05.019 --> 31:07.954
I married your mum
'cause I loved her.

31:08.022 --> 31:11.825
If I had to do it all
over again, you know...

31:11.893 --> 31:14.928
no, I take that back.

31:17.164 --> 31:19.432
Studies have shown
that the strongest deterrent

31:19.500 --> 31:21.568
to a lawsuit is familiarity,
a personal relationship,

31:21.636 --> 31:23.837
so I figure I establish
a rapport with Kevin,

31:23.905 --> 31:26.139
it'll be that much
harder for him to sue

31:26.207 --> 31:27.541
knowing it'll affect
my livelihood.

31:27.608 --> 31:28.975
Well, I'm goin' with you,

31:29.043 --> 31:30.844
because if this works,
I'm not letting you

31:30.912 --> 31:32.312
take all the credit
for saving Lightman.

31:32.380 --> 31:33.446
And if it doesn't work?

31:33.514 --> 31:34.848
Then it's all your fault,

31:34.916 --> 31:37.851
and I'm gonna call the Rader
firm and set up an interview.

31:38.719 --> 31:39.920
So, anyway, we just...

31:39.987 --> 31:42.989
We just wanted to come by
and see how you were doing.

31:43.057 --> 31:44.658
Last time we saw you,

31:44.725 --> 31:46.660
you were pretty upset,
understandably,

31:46.727 --> 31:48.562
so... and, uh...

31:48.629 --> 31:49.563
We...

31:49.630 --> 31:51.598
Well, we brought you
some pastries.

31:52.833 --> 31:54.568
We were worried you might
do something drastic.

31:54.635 --> 31:57.170
I know firsthand what stress can do.
It... it can...

31:57.238 --> 31:59.873
You call what I've been
going through just stress?

31:59.941 --> 32:02.309
Dr. Lightman tried
to stop the execution.

32:02.376 --> 32:04.311
He's devoted himself
to the case.

32:04.378 --> 32:07.180
He's very close to finding someone
else who may have been involved.

32:07.248 --> 32:09.416
That doesn't change
the fact that Jason is dead

32:09.483 --> 32:10.917
because your boss
made a mistake.

32:10.985 --> 32:12.986
Let's cut to the chase.
Why are you really here?

32:13.054 --> 32:15.755
- Mr. Wilk...
- To convince me not to sue Lightman.

32:17.291 --> 32:18.959
I know this might
seem pretty weird,

32:19.026 --> 32:23.296
but, um, if there's
anything you need...

32:24.165 --> 32:26.433
Or if you just wanna talk

32:26.500 --> 32:29.135
or something, that's my number.

32:34.542 --> 32:37.410
It was really nice
getting to know you.

32:39.747 --> 32:40.847
Thank you.

32:40.915 --> 32:44.551
No one can even look me
in the eye these days,

32:44.619 --> 32:46.653
so I appreciate it.

32:49.390 --> 32:51.725
Maybe I'll hold off
on suing Lightman

32:51.792 --> 32:53.560
till I learn what he finds.

32:57.164 --> 32:59.232
I did not hurt that little boy.

32:59.300 --> 33:01.901
You want me to confess,
but I won't.

33:06.107 --> 33:08.141
I did not hurt that little boy.

33:08.209 --> 33:10.877
You want me to confess,
but I won't.

33:17.418 --> 33:18.652
Lightman.

33:18.719 --> 33:21.454
Do you know who the
first liar in the world was?

33:22.790 --> 33:23.890
The devil.

33:23.958 --> 33:26.726
In the bible, he's called
the father of lies.

33:26.794 --> 33:30.196
Is Zoe a lawyer or a liar?

33:30.264 --> 33:32.599
Nah, if we're playin'
20 questions here,

33:32.667 --> 33:34.100
I think it's my turn.

33:34.168 --> 33:38.004
What's your deal
with eldest sons?

33:38.452 --> 33:42.207
Do you know
where your daughter is?

33:42.452 --> 33:45.458
Can she come out and play?

33:53.664 --> 33:55.174
Dial by name.

33:55.909 --> 33:56.984
Emily.

33:57.104 --> 33:58.181
Emily.

34:00.932 --> 34:02.769
- Emily.
- Hey, Cal, it's me.

34:02.889 --> 34:04.701
Emily left her phone here.
She went to see you.

34:04.821 --> 34:06.891
She left my place about an hour ago.

34:07.245 --> 34:08.496
We got a problem.

34:09.264 --> 34:12.367
Hannah said she never picked up Emily.
Tell me exactly what happened.

34:12.487 --> 34:15.387
I got a call on my private line, asking me
if I knew where Emily was.

34:16.789 --> 34:17.904
Was that him?

34:19.047 --> 34:19.972
What did he say?

34:20.092 --> 34:23.080
Yeah, this is Cal Lightman,
calling for Agent Reynolds.

34:23.199 --> 34:24.250
Well find him.

34:24.370 --> 34:26.902
- Tell him it's an emergency.
- What did he say?

34:27.255 --> 34:29.309
Look, the FBI will start a search.
We should just cool.

34:29.429 --> 34:30.962
Emily's friends...

34:34.871 --> 34:38.272
What? I told you Haley was picking me up.
We just went to get something to eat.

34:40.138 --> 34:41.304
You said Hannah.

34:41.373 --> 34:43.007
No, I said Haley.

34:44.342 --> 34:45.909
First there are
the phone calls.

34:45.976 --> 34:47.043
Then he takes your child.

34:47.112 --> 34:48.446
That's the pattern.

34:49.714 --> 34:51.949
Let's just go through
all this stuff again.

34:52.016 --> 34:53.384
What's in that box?

34:54.886 --> 34:57.955
Photos that Wilkie's mother
gave me during the trial

34:58.023 --> 35:00.791
to prove that Jason
was a good boy.

35:01.693 --> 35:03.828
Rex was kept alive for 3 days.

35:03.895 --> 35:05.262
News clippings aren't relevant.

35:05.330 --> 35:06.497
Everything is relevant.

35:06.565 --> 35:07.798
There is a killer
after our daughter,

35:07.866 --> 35:09.934
and the only way to keep
her safe is to catch him.

35:10.001 --> 35:11.836
You don't get to decide
what is and isn't relevant.

35:11.903 --> 35:13.237
That's precisely
what the killer wants.

35:13.305 --> 35:15.606
He wants to panic us into
stopping our search.

35:15.674 --> 35:18.776
The best way that we can
end this is to find him.

35:18.844 --> 35:21.412
I just wanna keep her safe.

35:24.249 --> 35:26.717
Well, the FBI's parked
right outside.

35:26.785 --> 35:30.521
I can't take any more.

35:32.524 --> 35:34.358
You can do this.

35:50.008 --> 35:51.509
Those photographs
from Wilkie's mum,

35:51.576 --> 35:54.845
are they, uh... are they
from when he was a kid?

35:54.913 --> 35:55.846
Yeah.

35:55.914 --> 35:57.081
Well, the Pied Piper and Jason

35:57.148 --> 35:58.516
knew each other
when they were kids,

35:58.583 --> 36:00.551
so there might be
something there.

36:06.391 --> 36:09.493
Kevin's the youngest, right?

36:09.561 --> 36:11.629
Well, look at
the body language.

36:11.696 --> 36:13.063
I mean, he's clearly
in control.

36:13.131 --> 36:14.365
He's dominant.
The other 2,

36:14.432 --> 36:16.267
the older 2, they just...
they adore him.

36:16.334 --> 36:18.135
And who's the older one?

36:19.170 --> 36:20.905
William.

36:20.972 --> 36:23.474
Wilkie's mother said
that her oldest son William

36:23.542 --> 36:26.477
died of pneumonia
when he was just a kid.

36:32.784 --> 36:34.385
Oh, my God.

36:34.452 --> 36:35.953
It's Kevin.

36:37.255 --> 36:38.522
Yeah.

36:38.590 --> 36:40.424
With a clarinet.

36:42.594 --> 36:45.362
Kevin is the pied piper, right?

36:45.430 --> 36:47.031
He made the phone calls.

36:47.098 --> 36:48.532
He kidnapped Rex,

36:48.600 --> 36:50.801
but he had Jason kill him.
They were partners.

36:50.869 --> 36:51.802
Why?

36:51.870 --> 36:54.138
It was revenge for the death

36:54.205 --> 36:55.439
of their eldest
brother, William.

36:55.507 --> 36:56.774
William came down
with pneumonia

36:56.841 --> 36:59.643
after their father lost his
job at the home fed diner.

36:59.711 --> 37:01.445
Right. Now, the diner
was torn down

37:01.513 --> 37:02.947
by the Sheridan company,

37:03.014 --> 37:04.014
their first development deal.

37:04.082 --> 37:05.649
Yeah, the family was
worried about money,

37:05.717 --> 37:07.618
so they didn't take him
to the hospital.

37:07.686 --> 37:08.919
He died after 3 days.

37:08.987 --> 37:11.288
So they blamed the Sheridan
family enough to kill Rex?

37:11.356 --> 37:12.690
And after Jason was executed,

37:12.757 --> 37:14.358
Kevin had to
take revenge again.

37:14.426 --> 37:15.659
All right, so we found

37:15.727 --> 37:16.860
Kevin's car at
the train station.

37:16.928 --> 37:18.596
He's long gone,
and there's no sign

37:18.663 --> 37:19.897
of Oliver at his house.

37:19.965 --> 37:22.066
We must have tipped him off
when we went to talk to him.

37:22.133 --> 37:23.734
We told him Lightman was close
to finding the culprit.

37:23.802 --> 37:28.072
Well, if his M.O. is to kill
the victim on the third day,

37:28.139 --> 37:30.007
Oliver could be dead already.

37:33.878 --> 37:35.312
All right, hit the lights.

37:40.118 --> 37:43.454
Well, the GPS on Kevin's car
shows us he was here 3 days ago.

37:43.521 --> 37:45.389
He was the chief
engineer on this project

37:45.457 --> 37:47.591
before it was shut down
about a month ago.

37:47.659 --> 37:49.994
All right, everybody.
Keep your eye and your ears open.

37:50.061 --> 37:51.295
Let's fan out.

38:04.509 --> 38:06.677
Whoa, whoa.
Shh, shh, shh!

38:09.547 --> 38:10.981
You hear that?

38:14.152 --> 38:15.686
There's someone in there.

38:15.754 --> 38:18.822
Give me something to
open this thing up with.

38:18.890 --> 38:20.057
Yeah.

38:24.596 --> 38:27.264
Ah, damn it!

38:28.700 --> 38:30.734
Heh heh.

38:33.204 --> 38:34.371
I hate rats.

38:34.439 --> 38:36.040
Pritchard, you stay
with Lightman.

38:36.107 --> 38:38.075
You three, come with me.

38:38.143 --> 38:39.443
Let's check upstairs.

38:59.998 --> 39:01.405
This doesn't belong here.

39:09.899 --> 39:11.042
Yeah, hold this.

39:32.057 --> 39:33.881
Oliver, can you hear me?

40:01.434 --> 40:03.665
- Aaah!
- Hold it right there. Don't move.

40:04.590 --> 40:05.706
Cal, you ok?

40:06.291 --> 40:07.652
Yeah, he's in the wall.

40:07.772 --> 40:08.781
Let me see your hands.

40:08.901 --> 40:11.025
- Check on Oliver.
- Come on, we got an agent down.

40:11.077 --> 40:12.018
Right on it.

40:18.982 --> 40:21.751
Mr. Sheridan,
I owe you an apology.

40:21.818 --> 40:24.086
Sorry about being
such an ass earlier.

40:24.154 --> 40:25.087
No, forget it.

40:25.155 --> 40:26.756
And thank you for everything.

40:26.823 --> 40:27.590
Pleasure.

40:27.658 --> 40:28.824
Hey, you're bleedin'.

40:28.892 --> 40:31.027
You sure you don't wanna
go to the hospital?

40:31.094 --> 40:33.129
Nah, these guys
are gonna patch me up.

40:34.598 --> 40:35.965
How 'bout, uh, Wilkie?

40:36.033 --> 40:38.467
We found equipment
he used to make the calls.

40:38.535 --> 40:40.770
He's not talkin' yet,
but he's stable.

40:40.837 --> 40:42.004
Stable?
He's an animal.

40:42.072 --> 40:45.041
If I had my way, he
wouldn't be talking at all.

40:45.976 --> 40:47.143
Good stuff.

40:51.315 --> 40:54.450
Beato Michaeli archangelo,

40:54.518 --> 40:55.451
beato Ioanni...

40:55.519 --> 40:56.686
Oh, turn that off.

40:57.754 --> 40:59.255
Are you ok?

40:59.323 --> 41:01.123
Peachy.

41:02.292 --> 41:04.760
I got hold of Jason Wilkie's
surveillance tape

41:04.828 --> 41:06.095
just before his execution.

41:06.163 --> 41:08.164
His final prayer was in Latin.

41:08.231 --> 41:09.899
It was a confession of sins.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.501
Maybe it was his way
of taking the blame

41:12.569 --> 41:13.936
for... for killing
Rex Sheridan.

41:14.004 --> 41:15.004
Ah.

41:15.072 --> 41:17.640
Well, I'd like to think
this is all over,

41:17.708 --> 41:19.842
but, yeah, I've been
wrong before, so...

41:19.910 --> 41:22.712
We never doubted you, Cal.
Really?

41:22.779 --> 41:25.581
Not for a second.
Really?

41:31.321 --> 41:33.122
I had your back.

41:33.190 --> 41:34.423
Oh, yeah?

41:35.325 --> 41:37.193
Well, I had an exit plan, too.

41:37.260 --> 41:38.327
Yeah. Jack Rader.

41:38.395 --> 41:40.730
Well, I'd have done
the same thing.

41:40.797 --> 41:42.898
Pays better.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.607
Ooh, sorry.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.075
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

41:53.143 --> 41:55.044
No, I'm doing
nothing of the sort.

41:55.112 --> 41:56.379
I'm like Florence Nightingale.

41:56.446 --> 41:58.714
You know, you could make
your life a whole lot easier

41:58.782 --> 42:00.549
if you would just admit
that you need people.

42:00.617 --> 42:02.652
You don't have to be
such a lone wolf, Cal.

42:02.719 --> 42:04.186
Aw, do me a favor.

42:04.254 --> 42:06.522
With you two and Foster
and the rest of the group,

42:06.590 --> 42:07.957
it's a 3-ring
bloody circus.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.325
You know what I mean.

42:09.393 --> 42:12.395
Let the record reflect
that Zoe Landau is correct.

42:12.462 --> 42:13.396
You happy now?

42:13.463 --> 42:14.997
Ecstatic.

42:15.065 --> 42:17.833
Ok, don't move.

42:17.901 --> 42:20.102
Don't move.

42:21.405 --> 42:23.072
Ok. You're all set.

42:23.140 --> 42:24.073
Really?
Yeah.

42:24.141 --> 42:26.075
Let's go get something to eat.

42:26.143 --> 42:30.079
Hey, I'm sorry you guys thought
I was missing earlier.

42:30.147 --> 42:32.281
You know, I thought
of a perfect solution

42:32.349 --> 42:34.150
that'll make sure that
never happens again.

42:34.217 --> 42:35.518
Oh, yeah? Let's hear it.

42:36.586 --> 42:37.753
Buy me a car.

42:37.821 --> 42:39.288
I mean, think about it.

42:39.356 --> 42:43.693
You'll never have to get confused
about who's picking me up.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.461
Ah, that's clever, that is.

42:45.529 --> 42:47.963
Yeah, well, she gets
