WEBVTT

00:01.833 --> 00:02.833
Listen to this.

00:02.900 --> 00:05.433
"Dear Dr. Love,
I'm a professional woman

00:05.500 --> 00:07.566
"who has trouble
with relationships.

00:07.633 --> 00:10.366
"When a man gets
too close, I pull away

00:10.433 --> 00:12.300
"and hurl scathing insults

00:12.366 --> 00:14.500
"which may have cost me
a relationship

00:14.566 --> 00:15.900
"that could have worked.

00:15.966 --> 00:19.600
"How can I find happiness after
the bedspring stops squeaking?

00:19.666 --> 00:22.600
Signed, The Maverick."

00:22.666 --> 00:23.966
So?

00:24.033 --> 00:28.733
So, so, this letter reeks
of Maxine Shaw Esquire.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.400
Not to mention, Kyle,
it's signed, "The Maverick."

00:31.466 --> 00:33.300
Isn't that her nickname?

00:33.366 --> 00:36.133
Well, I've heard her
called "wench

00:37.833 --> 00:40.800
"shrew,
soul‐numbing succubus"

00:42.033 --> 00:44.033
‐ but never "The Maverick."
‐ Mm‐hmm.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.766
I am almost positive that's
what they called her in college.

00:46.833 --> 00:49.066
[laughs]

00:49.133 --> 00:53.333
I cannot wait to wave this
on her little man‐hating face.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.666
[chuckles]

00:55.933 --> 00:57.766
Regine, this is
a national magazine.

00:57.833 --> 01:00.033
Thousands of people write in.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.673
I mean, I could've
just as easily written this.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.806
Check it out,
"Dear Professor Sartorial

01:03.873 --> 01:05.840
"I'm an incredibly
good looking stockbroker

01:05.906 --> 01:08.140
"with a closet
full of stylish designer suits.

01:08.206 --> 01:10.773
Why do my friends
think I am pompous?"

01:13.940 --> 01:16.906
Damn, Kyle,
that sounds just like you.

01:16.973 --> 01:18.240
Hardly.

01:18.306 --> 01:21.006
I would never call myself
"Incredibly good‐looking."

01:21.073 --> 01:23.073
Come on..

01:23.140 --> 01:25.606
Stylishly handsome, perhaps,
but only to friends.

Now, you guys, I know I'm right
about Max writing this letter.

02:02.845 --> 02:03.762
Yeah, right.

02:03.829 --> 02:05.262
Like you were right
about Gary Coleman

02:05.329 --> 02:07.262
proposing to Paula Abdul?

02:09.662 --> 02:10.961
[telephone ringing]

02:12.196 --> 02:15.129
Hello? Hey, daddy.

02:15.196 --> 02:17.129
Wow, he hasn't called here
in six months.

02:17.195 --> 02:18.762
Yeah, he must have
signed up for that

02:18.829 --> 02:21.929
new long distance program,
"Estranged Friends and Family."

02:23.762 --> 02:25.162
No, I don't have
any plans for this weekend.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.829
Why, what's up?

02:28.296 --> 02:29.896
Oh, she is.

02:30.896 --> 02:32.062
Alright, sure, no problem.

02:32.129 --> 02:33.729
Look, I'm kinda busy
right now, daddy.

02:33.796 --> 02:35.696
Love you, bye.

02:35.762 --> 02:37.096
Phew.

02:37.162 --> 02:38.996
Stephanie is coming
to New York for a track meet

02:39.062 --> 02:41.896
and he wants me to babysit
the little spoilt brat.

02:41.962 --> 02:44.496
‐ She is your sister.
‐ Half sister.

02:44.562 --> 02:47.329
Who I haven't seen
since I was fifteen.

02:47.396 --> 02:49.929
When she took my
Fashion Fair mahogany lipstick

02:49.996 --> 02:53.262
and wrote all over my walls,
"Khadijah got big jugs."

02:57.162 --> 02:59.029
Mmm,
Stephanie was only ten then.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.402
I wonder if she's taller.

03:02.669 --> 03:06.069
Hey, the dwarf gene
runs in our family.

03:06.136 --> 03:10.169
Uncle Darren is fifty and still
buys his clothing at Baby Gap.

03:14.569 --> 03:18.236
Overton, if someone wanted
to get into the offices

03:18.302 --> 03:20.536
of a major magazine
to, oh, I don't know

03:20.602 --> 03:23.769
rifle through their files,
how would they go about it?

03:23.836 --> 03:25.402
Well, that's the question

03:25.469 --> 03:27.002
that prompts you
to ask more questions.

03:27.069 --> 03:29.136
Like, what type of alarm
do they have?

03:29.202 --> 03:31.869
Infrared or ultrasonic.

03:31.936 --> 03:34.336
Is there roof access?

03:34.402 --> 03:36.902
Can you land a chopper?

03:36.969 --> 03:38.469
W‐w‐wa‐wa‐wait.

03:38.536 --> 03:40.769
You actually asked him that,
right?

03:40.836 --> 03:42.102
Regine, you are
obsessed with this.

03:42.169 --> 03:44.536
Hey, as you should be, pal.

03:44.602 --> 03:48.002
Now, Max said
that she screwed up

03:48.069 --> 03:49.602
a relationship
that could have worked.

03:49.669 --> 03:52.469
Which means that she is
just an emotional wreck

03:52.536 --> 03:54.936
over your breakup.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.036
Hi, people.

03:58.369 --> 04:00.642
Wow. Okay. Oh ho ho.

04:00.709 --> 04:01.709
Oh.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.109
Mmm.

04:04.176 --> 04:05.276
That's good stuff.

04:05.342 --> 04:08.142
Hey, girl, you seen,
uh, this month's issue of, uh

04:08.209 --> 04:09.409
"Magnifique?"

04:09.476 --> 04:12.342
Yeah, there's a letter in it
from a really pathetic woman

04:12.409 --> 04:14.509
who sabotages relationships.

04:14.576 --> 04:16.076
Interesting, huh?

04:16.142 --> 04:18.076
Maverick.

04:18.142 --> 04:20.076
Not at all, jackass.

04:23.076 --> 04:26.676
Uh, Maverick, you know,
lately I have been wondering

04:26.742 --> 04:29.376
whether the only woman
who ever pulled away from me

04:29.442 --> 04:31.709
regretted it?

04:31.776 --> 04:33.609
I don't know, all I remember
is you pullin' away

04:33.675 --> 04:35.575
after 30 seconds.

04:38.042 --> 04:40.176
Yeah, that's usually
when I open my eyes.

04:43.042 --> 04:44.609
This must stop. Look, Max.

04:44.676 --> 04:46.142
These two little busybodies

04:46.209 --> 04:49.142
think that you wrote
some letter to Dr. Love.

04:49.209 --> 04:50.876
Please, yeah, I wrote a letter

04:50.942 --> 04:53.109
to a‐a magazine
I know you all read.

04:53.176 --> 04:54.542
Well, listen, next month

04:54.609 --> 04:56.709
check out my, uh,
piece in "Highlights."

04:56.776 --> 04:59.942
Uh, trading peanut butter for
baloney, the art of the deal.

05:00.009 --> 05:02.382
Check that out, you two.

05:05.116 --> 05:06.716
She wrote it.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.582
And she know we know.

05:09.649 --> 05:13.016
How she gonna fix her mouth
to lie like that?

05:13.082 --> 05:15.016
Please, the woman lives
and breathes fiction.

05:15.082 --> 05:18.549
You know, girly told me that
she would be my love slave

05:18.616 --> 05:19.882
if I made her pancakes.

05:19.949 --> 05:22.016
After the fourth stack,
she was sound asleep

05:22.082 --> 05:24.449
and I was scrubbing
the grittle in my socks.

05:38.516 --> 05:41.949
Stephanie, from Chicago!

05:42.016 --> 05:44.382
No, Mary, from Liberia.

05:44.449 --> 05:45.782
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:45.849 --> 05:47.982
You're the seventh stranger
I've hugged today.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.482
(man on PA)
'All runners for
the second heat, five minutes.'

05:52.549 --> 05:54.482
Hey, that's, that's Stephanie.

05:54.549 --> 05:57.016
‐ Khadijah! Synclaire!
‐ Hi.

05:57.082 --> 05:59.782
What are you guys doing here?

05:59.849 --> 06:01.956
Oh, you must be covering
the meet for your magazine.

06:02.022 --> 06:04.222
Listen, before you take
my picture, let me run

06:04.289 --> 06:06.422
a couple of laps
so I can get my glow on.

06:06.489 --> 06:09.256
No, actually, I'm here
cause daddy called.

06:09.322 --> 06:11.289
Oh, I get it. Don't tell me.

06:11.356 --> 06:13.656
[imitating daddy]
"Keep an eye on my baby, make
sure she doesn't get mixed up

06:13.722 --> 06:16.689
with any of those
New York City pimps."

06:16.756 --> 06:18.922
You know how your father is
when it comes to you.

06:18.989 --> 06:21.156
You're his little Steffipoo.

06:21.222 --> 06:22.622
Uh, huh, well.

06:22.689 --> 06:26.389
I'm not ten
and my mom is in Chicago.

06:26.456 --> 06:29.056
Oh, look, don't waste
that little attitude on me.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.456
I didn't want to come here
in the first place.

06:31.522 --> 06:33.022
Listen, why don't you
come back after dinner

06:33.089 --> 06:35.022
I'm sure,
dad asked you to burp me.

06:36.889 --> 06:38.889
Oh, she's got a mouth like you.

06:40.789 --> 06:42.189
Bigger.

06:42.256 --> 06:44.189
Uh, uh, smaller.

06:44.256 --> 06:46.489
Uh, whatever would please you,
just don't hit me.

06:50.222 --> 06:51.556
A little more to the left.

06:52.856 --> 06:55.622
Stephanie,
what're you doin' here?

06:55.689 --> 06:58.022
[sigh]
A very big thing.

06:58.089 --> 07:02.196
Listen, I thought about it and
I guess I was kind of snotty.

07:02.262 --> 07:04.129
So, yes, I'm apologizing.

07:04.196 --> 07:06.629
You're welcome.

07:06.696 --> 07:09.462
Well, you know
how I hate apologizing too.

07:09.529 --> 07:12.262
So, I'm not even gonna fake it.

07:12.329 --> 07:14.329
No, no, I really am sorry.

07:14.396 --> 07:17.396
Besides, it's daddy's fault,
you know him, always pressing.

07:17.462 --> 07:18.896
[imitating her father]
"Who's this guy you're dating."

07:18.962 --> 07:20.862
"Don't you pay for your Visa
with your MasterCard."

07:20.929 --> 07:22.262
[laughs]

07:22.329 --> 07:24.929
Now, see, he and my mother
got divorced when I was five.

07:24.996 --> 07:27.896
I didn't have any dates
or credit cards at the time.

07:27.962 --> 07:29.096
You were lucky.

07:29.162 --> 07:31.462
Those finance charges
are worse than homework.

07:33.796 --> 07:37.562
Listen. While you're here, I
might as well give you the tour.

07:37.629 --> 07:40.796
Behold the "Flavor" empire.

07:40.862 --> 07:42.296
This is the reception area.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.762
Where I do all the recepting.

07:44.829 --> 07:47.496
This is our layout
and graphics section.

07:47.562 --> 07:48.896
And this is our Ivan.

07:48.962 --> 07:51.296
Ivan, this is my little sister,
Stephanie.

07:51.362 --> 07:54.929
‐ What's up? Nice to meet you.
‐ H‐hi.

07:54.996 --> 07:58.729
So tell me more about our Ivan.

07:59.962 --> 08:02.802
Well, he is a sophomore at NYU.

08:02.869 --> 08:07.202
Tsk, he's a copy aid here,
and an occasional migraine.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.636
[laughs]

08:08.702 --> 08:10.736
And he's 1200 miles
away from daddy

08:10.802 --> 08:12.802
so he won't be checking up
on us, you know what I'm saying?

08:12.869 --> 08:15.436
[chuckles]
Not really. Chill for a minute.

08:15.502 --> 08:19.436
Um, Ivan. I need you
to do me a favor.

08:19.502 --> 08:20.836
What you need me to do?

08:20.902 --> 08:22.936
Lay an article,
write some headlines

08:23.002 --> 08:26.036
draw you a tepid bath with
pink and white rose petals?

08:29.236 --> 08:31.202
[sigh]
I thought it would be
a good idea

08:31.269 --> 08:33.669
if you and Stephanie
hung out tonight.

08:33.736 --> 08:37.169
Promised my father I'd look out
for her when she was here.

08:37.236 --> 08:39.802
You passing the care of
your little sister onto me?

08:39.869 --> 08:42.202
Well, that's a thrill.
That's an honor.

08:42.269 --> 08:43.402
Well, actually
it's a combination of both.

08:43.469 --> 08:45.736
Like a thronor.

08:45.802 --> 08:47.902
Why don't you just shut up
and ask her out.

08:47.969 --> 08:49.336
Alright.

08:49.402 --> 08:51.369
Uh, Stephanie,
um, I was thinking

08:51.436 --> 08:52.636
you know, if you
weren't busy later‐‐

08:52.702 --> 08:55.369
Six o'clock, at the guest
quarters on East 53rd.

08:55.436 --> 08:57.402
See you later, Khadijah.
Bye, Synclaire.

08:57.469 --> 09:00.442
Oh, and I will see you tonight,
Ivan, dress is casual.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.576
Well, damn, where am I
supposed to take her?

09:08.276 --> 09:10.076
I don't know, where do you
usually go on Friday nights?

09:10.142 --> 09:12.476
Well, I sit on my bike across
the street from your house.

09:16.676 --> 09:19.642
Hey, Max, you'll be able
to relate to this movie.

09:19.709 --> 09:22.142
It's about a man‐hating woman
who joins a convent.

09:22.209 --> 09:24.876
It's called
"Mother Superior Maverick."

09:26.409 --> 09:27.842
Synclaire, your hamster
got loose again

09:27.909 --> 09:29.376
and rolled around
in your makeup.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.476
I don't believe this.

09:32.542 --> 09:34.176
That was Stephanie's roommate.

09:34.242 --> 09:35.342
The girl missed curfew.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.676
[doorbell rings]

09:39.909 --> 09:41.276
Ugh!

09:41.342 --> 09:43.109
Where the hell have you been?

09:43.176 --> 09:44.976
We went to a party.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.676
♪ Party over here
party over here ♪

09:47.742 --> 09:49.342
Ahh!

09:49.409 --> 09:51.376
♪ Party over there ♪

09:51.442 --> 09:53.709
Stephanie, what the hell
is wrong with you?

09:54.776 --> 09:55.709
Mmm.

10:01.016 --> 10:03.016
Oh.

10:03.082 --> 10:06.682
Oh, the little angel's
tuckered out from dancing.

10:09.516 --> 10:11.516
She's stinkin' drunk.

10:20.706 --> 10:21.737
Ivan, talk. Fast.

10:21.804 --> 10:22.904
Well, uh, we was
at a really crowded

10:22.970 --> 10:24.204
dorm party and we got separated.

10:24.270 --> 10:26.204
Next thing I know,
she was dancing with a hat rack.

10:28.070 --> 10:30.870
Uh, listen, I'm sorry,
Khadijah, I let you down, and..

10:30.937 --> 10:32.304
If you need me
I'll be across the street

10:32.370 --> 10:34.304
performing CPR
on my dying heart.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.570
No, all I did was eat
these little jiggly cubes.

10:41.637 --> 10:43.237
I've a green tongue, see?

10:43.304 --> 10:45.370
[giggling]

10:45.437 --> 10:47.104
Yeah, well,
give it some time, honey.

10:47.170 --> 10:49.137
By tomorrow,
the rest of you'll be green too.

10:49.204 --> 10:51.104
[laughs]

10:51.170 --> 10:52.237
Jelly shots.

10:52.304 --> 10:53.670
Gelatin and green alcohol.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.837
That's how grandma
kept the kids quiet. Uh.

10:59.404 --> 11:02.077
Okay, Stephanie,
you missed curfew

11:02.144 --> 11:03.244
you're drunk..

11:03.310 --> 11:05.277
I mean, what do you have
to say for yourself?

11:06.144 --> 11:07.444
Come on, out with it.

11:13.977 --> 11:14.910
[retching]

11:14.977 --> 11:17.177
Oh! Damn!

11:18.644 --> 11:20.244
Well, look on the bright side.

11:20.310 --> 11:21.977
She did it on
Regine's favorite slippers.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.010
What's that?

11:28.077 --> 11:30.810
My special elixir for hangovers.

11:30.877 --> 11:33.144
Tomato juice,
a chocolate yoo‐hoo.

11:33.210 --> 11:34.710
And a boiled egg.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.710
Wow, it's got kick.

11:38.444 --> 11:41.544
Oh, honey, drink this.
It'll make you feel better.

11:41.610 --> 11:43.544
‐ Um, what is it?
‐ Apple juice.

11:47.277 --> 11:48.444
Hmm.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.644
Don't get too comfortable.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.677
I called Coach Braxton
and covered for you.

11:53.744 --> 11:55.310
You got warm‐ups at 1 o'clock.

11:55.377 --> 11:57.510
Thanks,
but I'm not running today.

11:57.577 --> 11:59.110
Or ever.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.317
I'm quitting.

12:00.384 --> 12:01.684
Stephanie!

12:01.750 --> 12:04.017
You can't give up
your dream of‐of‐of winning

12:04.084 --> 12:05.684
the Olympic Decathlon.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.450
That's not my dream.

12:08.517 --> 12:10.450
Yeah, well, it's one of mine.

12:12.384 --> 12:14.750
Okay, hold up there.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.150
You've been running
since junior high school.

12:16.217 --> 12:18.150
Now, all of a sudden
you don't feel like it?

12:19.517 --> 12:23.584
No. When I first
started running I loved it.

12:23.650 --> 12:25.617
But then all of a sudden
I started winning.

12:25.684 --> 12:28.950
And then I didn't have a father,
I had a live‐in coach.

12:29.017 --> 12:31.684
Do you know that man built
a track for me in the backyard?

12:31.750 --> 12:34.517
Four hundred and thirty two
times around is a mile.

12:38.017 --> 12:39.384
Poor little Stephanie.

12:39.450 --> 12:40.917
Daddy made her run
and she ended up

12:40.984 --> 12:43.084
gettin' a college scholarship.

12:43.150 --> 12:44.850
[sigh]
You are just like dad.

12:44.917 --> 12:47.284
You think you're always right.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.650
You know, I don't care.
You can't make me run.

12:49.717 --> 12:52.284
[chuckles]

12:52.350 --> 12:54.084
See, now that's
where you're wrong.

12:54.150 --> 12:55.917
Now, I promised daddy
I would look out for you

12:55.984 --> 12:57.050
while you are here.

12:57.117 --> 12:58.684
And you're going
to that track meet

12:58.750 --> 13:00.284
if I have to drag you.

13:00.350 --> 13:02.990
The only way that's gonna happen
is if you knock me out.

13:11.924 --> 13:13.724
Huh.

13:13.790 --> 13:16.057
Wait, Khadijah, I'm going.
No, I'm going!

13:19.857 --> 13:21.490
[sobs]

13:21.557 --> 13:24.224
What is wrong with you?

13:24.290 --> 13:26.590
First you wipe up her vomit
then you threaten to kill her.

13:26.657 --> 13:28.690
Y'all are bonding.

13:33.990 --> 13:35.024
Kyle.

13:37.190 --> 13:38.124
What?

13:39.657 --> 13:40.790
Styrofoam peanuts for dinner.

13:40.857 --> 13:42.790
What're we having for dessert?
Bubble wrap?

13:44.024 --> 13:46.390
No, silly, it's a decoy bag.

13:46.457 --> 13:50.024
See, whenever I come home with
groceries, Max always shows up.

13:50.090 --> 13:54.290
So, when she gets here, you
will dredge up enough sincerity

13:54.357 --> 13:57.090
to get her to confess
that she wrote the letter.

13:57.157 --> 14:01.797
[sigh]
Regine, you are
a sick, sick woman.

14:02.764 --> 14:04.830
And I love you for it.

14:13.130 --> 14:16.197
Uh, Maxine, Maxine, I got
a serious question to ask you.

14:16.264 --> 14:18.197
Yes, Kyle, I faked
every one of 'em.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.964
Uh, maybe, I ought
to give you two some privacy.

14:31.930 --> 14:33.897
Yeah, that's a good idea,
Regine.

14:33.964 --> 14:35.230
Why don't you come over here.

14:35.297 --> 14:37.930
This bannister might collapse,
I need a little test dummy.

14:37.997 --> 14:39.930
Mmm.

14:39.997 --> 14:42.564
Maxine, look, I know
that our breakup crushed you

14:42.630 --> 14:44.864
and I just want you know
that I'm here for you.

14:44.930 --> 14:46.797
And you can tell me anything.
I mean anything.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.130
Kyle, you're right.

14:51.197 --> 14:52.864
I mean, I guess I should've
come and talked to you

14:52.930 --> 14:54.964
about how I felt
since we broke up.

14:55.030 --> 14:56.364
[sobs]

14:56.430 --> 14:57.364
Pain.

14:58.630 --> 15:00.970
All the pain..

15:01.037 --> 15:03.070
...that you two've been
in my ass.

15:05.937 --> 15:09.204
I told you, I did not
write that freaking letter.

15:10.704 --> 15:13.837
Man, Kyle, you couldn't
get dirt from a dustbuster.

15:15.670 --> 15:18.637
Oh, hold up, you Minute Meda,
let me tell you something.

15:18.704 --> 15:20.337
I'm goin' back upstairs

15:20.404 --> 15:23.237
and do what I was supposed
to be doin' all along

15:23.304 --> 15:26.404
which is
minding my own business.

15:28.837 --> 15:30.104
Buh‐bye.

15:34.304 --> 15:36.004
See, you lyin'!

15:37.304 --> 15:39.270
I mean, I knew I should've
just hypnotized you

15:39.337 --> 15:41.270
with a canned ham.

15:46.770 --> 15:48.237
Can you believe those clowns?

15:48.304 --> 15:49.670
I hear you.

15:49.737 --> 15:51.470
So, they give you a free copy
of the magazine

15:51.537 --> 15:52.837
when they ran your letter?

15:52.904 --> 15:55.870
No, just a release form
and this coupon for tampons.

16:03.077 --> 16:04.844
No, Khadijah.

16:04.910 --> 16:06.810
There's no way I can run.

16:06.877 --> 16:09.010
Sure you can. Come on, now.

16:09.077 --> 16:11.277
One day you're gonna thank me
for dragging you out here.

16:11.344 --> 16:13.844

'Next up,
the women's 100 meters.'

16:13.910 --> 16:16.177
Oh, that's it. Go get 'em, girl.

16:16.244 --> 16:18.177
‐ Okay.
‐ Come on, now.

16:24.244 --> 16:27.844
(man on PA)
'Ready. Set.'

16:27.910 --> 16:28.844

'Push it, Steph, push it.'

16:43.677 --> 16:45.044
I got it.

16:45.110 --> 16:47.210
Oh, damn, I lost it.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.010
Oh, hey there, Stephanie.

16:53.077 --> 16:54.777
I baked you
some victory brownies.

16:54.844 --> 16:56.744
They're in the kitchen
cooling off right now.

16:56.810 --> 16:59.010
And why am I talking
to nobody at all?

17:00.884 --> 17:02.150
What happened?

17:02.217 --> 17:03.284
Well, lets just say
that this time

17:03.350 --> 17:05.750
she made it to the bathroom.

17:05.817 --> 17:08.884

frost on the pumpkin

come out laughing."

17:19.617 --> 17:22.184
Synclaire, you want
to help me out here?

17:22.250 --> 17:25.017
Be good to her, be kind to her.

17:25.084 --> 17:27.983
I don't really get
that squirrels part.

17:28.050 --> 17:29.684
Well, she does seem pretty down.

17:29.750 --> 17:31.684
Maybe, I should go talk to her.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.517
Oh, well.

Ooh, Synclaire,
I think we should, uh

17:52.650 --> 17:53.850
go on upstairs, babe.

‐ No, I want to stay.
‐ No.

Oh, now, now,
wait, hold on a minute.

18:04.824 --> 18:05.824
Few minutes ago,
you were drinkin'

18:05.890 --> 18:07.724
from the fountain of my wisdom.

18:07.790 --> 18:09.724
Now, it's like
I don't know diddly?

18:12.157 --> 18:15.024
Would you excuse us please,
Khadijah, Stephanie?

18:15.090 --> 18:17.224
Overton and I have something
to discuss out in the hallway.

Overton, come along.
We'll be right back.

18:19.324 --> 18:21.324
‐ Oh, no, we won't.
‐ Oh, yes, we will.

18:21.390 --> 18:23.290
‐ Mama, we ain't coming back.
‐ I got something to say.

18:23.357 --> 18:24.557
[indistinct shouting]

18:24.624 --> 18:25.990
What you tellin' me, huh? What?

18:26.057 --> 18:27.657
You tellin' me..

18:33.824 --> 18:34.790
[radio static]

18:34.857 --> 18:36.024
Ow!

18:37.024 --> 18:39.624
How can you party like this?

18:39.690 --> 18:42.257
Listen, I may have
lost the race

18:42.324 --> 18:44.257
but I won the 100‐yard puke.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.024
[laughs]

18:46.090 --> 18:47.990
I feel liberated.

18:48.057 --> 18:49.590
Alright.

18:49.657 --> 18:51.357
You'll be liberated
from that gold card

18:51.424 --> 18:53.557
when daddy finds out
you got drunk.

18:53.624 --> 18:56.190
You never call dad
and when you finally do

18:56.257 --> 18:57.757
it's to tell on me.

18:57.824 --> 18:59.757
Some big sister you are.

18:59.824 --> 19:02.564
Psst. Don't talk to me
about being a good sister.

19:02.630 --> 19:04.730
I seen you twice in ten years.

19:04.797 --> 19:07.097
The first time
I'm hosing down my wall.

19:07.164 --> 19:09.430
The second time
I'm mopping up my floor.

19:09.497 --> 19:10.697
I don't know what's
gonna happen the next time

19:10.764 --> 19:13.930
but everything is
getting covered in plastic.

19:13.997 --> 19:16.130
Like there's
gonna be a next time.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.697
You don't like having me around.

19:18.764 --> 19:21.830
You're jealous because I grew up
with daddy and you didn't.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.064
Well, maybe
I am a little jealous.

19:26.130 --> 19:29.864
I didn't get a funky little
race track around my backyard.

19:29.930 --> 19:32.197
Shoot, I didn't even get
the big pimp speech.

19:33.364 --> 19:34.464
At least you didn't get the

19:34.530 --> 19:36.830
"Why can't you be more
like Khadijah?" speech.

19:38.730 --> 19:40.664
What're you talking about?

19:42.397 --> 19:45.297
"Khadijah held down two jobs
while she was in college.

19:45.364 --> 19:47.830
"Khadijah started
her own magazine.

19:47.897 --> 19:49.997
"Khadijah, the mover, the shaker

19:50.064 --> 19:52.964

on the move."

19:53.030 --> 19:55.030
I could run my whole life.

19:55.097 --> 19:57.030
I'd never catch up to you.

19:58.430 --> 20:01.004
Mover and a shaker, huh?

20:01.070 --> 20:03.870
Dang, maybe I should put
that man's number in speed dial.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.470
You know, you two should talk.

20:06.537 --> 20:08.204
And if you could
come up with a problem

20:08.270 --> 20:09.770
for him to solve
for an hour or so

20:09.837 --> 20:11.737
maybe he'd get off my case.

20:11.804 --> 20:13.404
You don't know what it's like.

20:13.470 --> 20:16.304
He has enough overprotectiveness
for two daughters.

20:16.370 --> 20:18.304
But, I'm the only one there.

20:19.670 --> 20:21.337
Hmm..

20:21.404 --> 20:24.204
And all this time
I thought you were a brat.

20:24.270 --> 20:26.237
But you're really
just a misunderstood girl

20:26.304 --> 20:29.837
who gets too much attention
and everything she wants, huh?

20:31.870 --> 20:34.404
And I thought you were bossy.

20:34.470 --> 20:36.137
But you're just
a regular person who thinks

20:36.204 --> 20:37.737
she's in charge of the world.

20:39.304 --> 20:40.237
Well.

20:41.404 --> 20:43.937
Glad we understand
each other now.

20:44.004 --> 20:46.737
Things should run more smoothly
the next time you come visit.

20:47.904 --> 20:49.370
Next time?

20:49.437 --> 20:50.770
Sure.

20:50.837 --> 20:53.937
Could be nice having
someone around, who idolizes me.

20:57.237 --> 20:59.377
We decided to stay
for the argument.

21:06.210 --> 21:08.144

<i>Don't go away,</i>

21:11.477 --> 21:13.810

21:13.877 --> 21:15.344
You got the speed

21:15.410 --> 21:18.077
the youth and the ability.

21:18.144 --> 21:21.144
But I got one thing on my side.

21:21.210 --> 21:23.210
I'm willing to die
to win this race.

21:24.310 --> 21:26.810
‐ Ahh.
‐ Okay, take your marks.

21:31.510 --> 21:34.144
Get set.

21:34.210 --> 21:35.244
Go!

21:45.210 --> 21:46.144
Okay, okay.

21:46.210 --> 21:48.144
How about the shot put?

21:49.777 --> 21:52.244
Pole vault?
