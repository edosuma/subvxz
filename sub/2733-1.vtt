01:18.000 --> 01:22.712
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Oh, yeah!

01:22.795 --> 01:26.090
Okay, you're great.

01:26.174 --> 01:29.218
- You got the line?
- Yeah. Come on up, slowpoke.

01:35.307 --> 01:38.893
Help!

01:40.269 --> 01:44.023
You okay? You know,
we're 50 miles from anybody.

01:44.106 --> 01:47.025
- Who are you screamin' for?
- You!

01:47.108 --> 01:49.527
Come on.

01:50.612 --> 01:52.905
Just pull me up!

01:55.324 --> 01:57.284
Rich?

01:58.952 --> 02:01.245
Just pull me up.

02:02.705 --> 02:07.709
All right, don't be a dick,
Richie. I need a pull.

02:07.793 --> 02:09.919
Rich?

02:10.002 --> 02:12.714
Rich?

02:14.466 --> 02:17.093
What...

05:42.146 --> 05:45.566
When you plant seed
into your own kin, you anger God.

05:45.649 --> 05:50.903
Still have not been
able to locate the two college students.

05:50.987 --> 05:54.906
Richard Stoker and Halley Smith
have been missing since last Monday...

05:54.990 --> 05:57.075
after failing to return
from a weekend of rock...

07:08.221 --> 07:10.806
- Hey. How are you doin'?

07:10.889 --> 07:14.309
Do you have any idea
what's going on up here?

07:15.644 --> 07:18.062
Tractor jackknifed
about five mile up.

07:18.145 --> 07:20.356
Spilled chemicals and shit
all over the road.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.691
Any idea how long
it'll take to clean up?

07:22.775 --> 07:26.528
- Couple hours.
- Couple hours?

07:26.569 --> 07:29.697
You in a hurry?

07:29.739 --> 07:33.200
Yeah. I need to get
to Raleigh tonight.

07:33.283 --> 07:36.120
- What you oughta do
is get back in your car,
- Mm-hmm.

07:36.203 --> 07:38.497
Fix your hair a couple
hundred more times...

07:38.580 --> 07:41.374
Thank you.

08:03.893 --> 08:07.564
Hey, Doris.
This is Chris Flynn.

08:07.647 --> 08:10.400
I have a 7:00 p.m.
Interview with Mr. Keller.

08:10.483 --> 08:12.943
I'm, uh, running
about 30 minutes late.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.237
- I was wondering if you could...

08:15.320 --> 08:18.281
Hello? Hello?

08:18.322 --> 08:21.075
I'm not gonna make this.

09:08.992 --> 09:12.161
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a pay phone?

09:24.255 --> 09:28.133
Uh, this one's not working. Do you
have another phone I could use?

09:28.175 --> 09:31.178
Long distance?

09:31.220 --> 09:33.805
What isn't long distance
from here, right?

09:33.846 --> 09:35.807
You cuttin' wise
with me, son?

09:35.848 --> 09:39.310
No, sir, I'm just...
I'm runnin' behind...

09:39.394 --> 09:42.312
and I really need
to make a call.

09:42.354 --> 09:45.148
Well, that'n there
is my only phone.

09:45.232 --> 09:47.275
Right.

09:49.068 --> 09:53.322
Well, uh, the highway's
really jammed up.

09:53.364 --> 09:55.866
Do you know of another
route heading south?

09:55.950 --> 09:58.660
- No.
- No.

10:05.290 --> 10:07.876
Why is this Bear Mountain Road
dotted like this?

10:07.960 --> 10:10.671
- Dirt.
- Dirt road?

10:10.713 --> 10:13.965
'Fraid they ain't got around
to pavin' it yet.

10:14.048 --> 10:17.635
It looks like it runs into the highway
about 15, 20 miles. Is that right?

10:17.719 --> 10:19.845
If you say so.

10:21.930 --> 10:25.225
It could work.
Thank you very much.

10:25.308 --> 10:27.309
You take care, okay?

10:38.737 --> 10:42.531
You're the one
gonna need to take care.

12:10.483 --> 12:12.818
Wejust got nailed, man.!

12:12.901 --> 12:15.612
- Jesus Christ.!
- Shit.!

12:15.696 --> 12:17.948
- Goddamn drunken hillbilly!
- Hey. Hey, you all right?

12:17.989 --> 12:21.450
I'm so sorry.
I was just...

12:21.492 --> 12:23.494
- Jesus.
- I was just comin' around the bend.

12:23.536 --> 12:26.330
- I didn't even see... I got distracted.
- My God, you could've died!

12:26.414 --> 12:29.124
- Are you guys all okay?
- Yeah, yeah. You wanna sit down?

12:29.207 --> 12:31.751
- You might be in shock.
- What were you doing
driving so goddamn fast?

12:31.835 --> 12:34.963
- All right, all right.
- Why was your truck parked
in the middle of the road?

12:35.046 --> 12:37.131
Because we blew out
our tires, asshole!

12:37.172 --> 12:40.968
- I'll pay for whatever damage was done.
- That's my mom's car!

12:41.010 --> 12:43.012
All right, Frannie.
The man said he'd pay for...

12:43.052 --> 12:45.805
Oh, looks like you killed
my bike here too.

12:45.888 --> 12:49.434
I'm sorry. L...
How did you blow out your tires?

12:49.517 --> 12:51.977
Someone left some barbed wire
in the middle of the road.

12:52.060 --> 12:54.521
I can't believe someone
just dropped it there.

12:54.604 --> 12:57.858
Nobody dropped anything.

12:57.941 --> 13:00.151
I just found this tied to a tree.
Somebody did this.

13:00.234 --> 13:03.154
Southern hospitality at its finest.

13:03.195 --> 13:05.822
- Redneck assholes.
- I'm gonna try and find a phone.

13:05.864 --> 13:08.658
I think I saw a gas station
like a couple miles back.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.369
- I'm gonna come with you.
- There is no phone.

13:11.453 --> 13:14.872
- I was just there.
- Why don't we just wait for
someone else to come along?

13:14.913 --> 13:17.207
What, like Speed Racer here?

13:17.291 --> 13:21.544
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Okay, you guys go, and
we'll just stay here, Francine.

13:21.627 --> 13:24.714
- And get high.
- Yeah. So what?

13:24.797 --> 13:27.008
- Careful. They don't like stoners.
- Who are you calling a stoner?

13:27.091 --> 13:29.301
- Your mom.
- Hey, what's your name?

13:29.384 --> 13:31.178
Chris Flynn.

13:31.261 --> 13:33.638
You hurt, Chris Flynn?

13:33.722 --> 13:36.724
- No, I'm fine.
- Good.

13:38.893 --> 13:41.687
- 'Cause you're the mule.
- Oh, no.

13:41.771 --> 13:44.981
You know, I can carry that. You just
had the whole car accident thing.

13:45.065 --> 13:47.442
Yeah, we'll just stay here
and maybe get hit again.

13:47.525 --> 13:49.653
- Are you guys sure you're cool?
- Yeah.

13:49.736 --> 13:52.029
Yeah, we'll be just fine.
Thank you.

13:52.112 --> 13:56.033
- Mess you up.
- Yeah, smoke it up there, uh, Skippy.

13:56.075 --> 13:59.202
- Yeah, have fun.
- I don't fuckin'believe this.

14:02.038 --> 14:04.332
Your mom's gonna kick your ass.

14:06.125 --> 14:08.752
God, I cannot get out of my head
what just happened.

14:08.835 --> 14:12.547
- Are you sure you're all right? Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

14:12.631 --> 14:14.965
What are you guys
doing out here?

14:15.049 --> 14:18.219
Uh, uh, oh, camping.
Uh, I don't know. Actually, we're lost.

14:18.260 --> 14:22.389
You know, a lot of people say...
who have been through similar
traumatic experiences...

14:22.472 --> 14:26.935
that the following moments kind of feel
like you're moving kind of in slow motion.

14:27.018 --> 14:29.269
- Do you feel like that?
- No.

14:29.353 --> 14:33.023
I should tell you that my voice
is fairly low and normal speed.

14:37.860 --> 14:41.864
- Pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.

14:45.534 --> 14:47.619
Where'd you get this?

14:47.703 --> 14:50.580
Um, I got it out of my
dad's room, actually.

14:50.664 --> 14:53.916
- You can finish it.

14:58.337 --> 15:00.755
I can't believe
they called us stoners.

15:00.839 --> 15:03.883
Dickheads.

15:03.967 --> 15:06.927
Are you sure
you know where we're going?

15:06.969 --> 15:09.763
Yeah. There was a map
at the gas station.

15:09.805 --> 15:11.890
Oh, I'm so tired already.

15:11.974 --> 15:15.143
I'm starving,
and I'm being eaten by ants.

15:15.226 --> 15:17.270
Are there any on my back?

15:17.353 --> 15:20.815
No, nothing there.
Oh, hey-ho! I call it. Uh, squirrel.

15:20.857 --> 15:24.318
- Well, you said you were hungry, Carly.
- I don't think it's a squirrel.

15:24.359 --> 15:27.362
- It's a mink.
- Really? How do you know?

15:27.446 --> 15:29.739
- Probably ran over it.

15:29.822 --> 15:34.076
In medical school, they make you
work on animal cadavers
before you get to the real thing.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.078
- It's a mink.
- Oh.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.914
It's a mink?

15:39.998 --> 15:42.584
I need to be in Raleigh by 7:00.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.627
Hmm. Better get
a move-on, then.

15:45.753 --> 15:48.255
You know, we should've
just taken her to New York.

15:48.339 --> 15:51.842
No. You know how she loves
this outdoor stuff.

15:51.925 --> 15:53.885
Yeah.

15:53.968 --> 15:56.804
If you ask me, though,
nature sucks.

15:56.846 --> 16:01.808
Well, the next time she gets dumped,
we'll take her to New York.

16:05.187 --> 16:07.480
Drop your pants.

16:07.563 --> 16:09.982
What?

16:10.024 --> 16:12.109
When do people
always show up, Evan?

16:12.193 --> 16:14.862
What are we doing?

16:14.945 --> 16:17.280
Consider it an experiment
in probability theory.

16:17.364 --> 16:19.282
Really?

16:21.868 --> 16:24.828
Mmm. I love you.

16:24.870 --> 16:26.830
I know.

16:26.872 --> 16:30.124
Now get them
trousers off, boy. Don't be a sissy.

16:30.208 --> 16:33.044
- All right.

16:34.879 --> 16:38.799
You know, I've been thinking
about this whole wedding thing...

16:38.882 --> 16:41.343
and I think we should
take a trip down to Mexico.

16:41.385 --> 16:44.429
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm talking about a long weekend...

16:44.513 --> 16:48.808
margaritas, the two of us
on a beach alone, sunset.

16:48.891 --> 16:53.269
And, you know,
I'm talking about just, just eloping.

16:53.353 --> 16:57.315
- You know what I mean?
- Uh, wait a second.

16:57.399 --> 16:59.734
You wanna know what I think?

16:59.818 --> 17:01.735
Yes, please.

17:01.819 --> 17:05.489
- I think if you ever
want to get in my pants again,
- Affirmative.

17:05.571 --> 17:08.241
This is the last time
you use the "E" word.

17:08.324 --> 17:12.328
Okay? Okay.

17:12.412 --> 17:14.579
Yeah, it's a disgusting word.

17:14.664 --> 17:16.748
Hey, guys, hold on.

17:19.835 --> 17:22.878
Hey, is anyone up there?

17:24.505 --> 17:26.589
Hello!

17:26.674 --> 17:30.511
- There must be people nearby.
- Anyone up there?

17:30.594 --> 17:34.556
- Somebody had to start it.

17:34.639 --> 17:36.599
Let's keep moving.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.020
Hello?

17:45.607 --> 17:47.859
Freaky.

17:51.904 --> 17:55.073
Oh, look at this.
It's fucked!

17:55.157 --> 17:58.702
Nothing. Nothing.

18:02.413 --> 18:04.415
Hey, did you find
anything to eat?

18:04.498 --> 18:07.084
They took all my Power Bars.

18:07.126 --> 18:09.919
Um, no.

18:09.961 --> 18:13.548
No. Sorry.

18:17.301 --> 18:21.096
Damn it. Scott and Carly
took all our friggin' sunscreen.

18:23.515 --> 18:25.725
Does he have any good CD's?

18:27.101 --> 18:30.938
Mmm. Definitely not.

18:35.233 --> 18:38.779
You know, I think this guy
must be some kind of doctor.

18:38.819 --> 18:42.823
Maybe we could get him to write us
some prescriptions when he gets back.

18:42.907 --> 18:46.035
He doesn't have
any smokes either.

18:46.118 --> 18:48.078
Almost out.

18:56.251 --> 18:58.212
Evan?

19:09.846 --> 19:12.391
Evan? Where are you?

19:14.267 --> 19:16.478
Hey, baby,
what are you doing?

19:16.520 --> 19:21.315
I'm just... amusing myself.
Whoooo!

19:21.357 --> 19:24.151
You, uh, getting
anything there, chatty?

19:24.234 --> 19:26.569
No, nothing.
I'm gonna miss this thing.

19:26.653 --> 19:30.824
- Why didn't you just fly?
- I put all of my money
into that car back there.

19:30.907 --> 19:35.327
Okay, forget eloping, but there is an idea we
should discuss about the band for our wedding.

19:35.411 --> 19:39.664
I think we should hire a... you know,
a Frank Sinatra-type, uh, lead singer...

19:39.747 --> 19:42.917
as opposed to
a James Brown-type lead singer...

19:43.001 --> 19:45.920
because, you know, really, let's be
honest, there's only oneJames Brown...

19:46.004 --> 19:49.339
and, you know, a faux James Brown
is really quite intolerable.

19:53.218 --> 19:56.971
Evan? Where are you?

19:57.054 --> 20:00.182
You pissing or something?

20:05.812 --> 20:07.731
Evan?

20:37.590 --> 20:41.885
You know, plus he'd be grinding his hips,
and my grandmother would be...

20:41.927 --> 20:47.057
yes, revolted
but also strangely fascinated
in a completely disturbing way...

20:47.140 --> 20:49.600
and, um...

20:51.769 --> 20:53.729
Baby?

20:56.272 --> 20:59.150
Carly, I wa...
I was kidding.

20:59.233 --> 21:01.861
Carly?

21:05.322 --> 21:08.241
- Evan?

21:34.847 --> 21:38.226
Sweetheart?
Hey, guys, hold up!

21:38.268 --> 21:41.812
Guys, hold up
for a second, all right?

21:41.895 --> 21:45.565
Baby, seriously,
this isn't funny.

21:47.401 --> 21:49.819
- Jesus God!

21:49.902 --> 21:52.822
- Baby!

21:52.905 --> 21:56.574
- L...
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

21:56.616 --> 21:59.494
I could've killed you, woman.
I'm-I'm extremely dangerous.

21:59.577 --> 22:02.289
You wanna know
why I love you so much?

22:02.372 --> 22:04.498
Because you're so fun
to play with.

22:04.582 --> 22:07.626
Is that why you love me?
That really scared me, baby.

22:07.710 --> 22:10.837
- I'm sorry.
- That really scared me.
Would you not do that?

22:10.920 --> 22:13.339
Hello.!

22:15.842 --> 22:18.303
Hello.!

22:21.471 --> 22:24.933
There's, uh, nothing
like stating the obvious, huh?

22:25.017 --> 22:29.312
- Hey, baby, look at this.

22:29.395 --> 22:34.149
Whoo! Hey, Carly, I think
this would be good time for you
to confront your fear of...

22:34.190 --> 22:37.485
Don't!
Okay, that is not funny.

22:37.527 --> 22:39.696
Look who's scared now.

22:43.365 --> 22:45.326
- Sorry.
- Whatever.

22:45.367 --> 22:48.370
Just get me to a motel room...

22:48.454 --> 22:50.622
run me a very hot bath...

22:50.663 --> 22:54.334
and be prepared to provide me
with a lot of orgasms.

22:54.417 --> 22:57.836
- Oh!
- I think they need to be alone.

22:57.878 --> 23:00.672
What do you expect?
They just got engaged.

23:00.756 --> 23:02.883
They're happy.
It's a hard thing to find.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.884
Yeah.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.011
- Got it?
- Limber tongue. Got it.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.013
You're stupid.

23:19.563 --> 23:22.358
Maybe we shouldn't
have left Francine and Evan.

23:22.399 --> 23:24.902
Don't worry. They're fine.

23:24.985 --> 23:28.071
- You guys okay?
- Super.

23:31.908 --> 23:34.743
Well, wait, guys.
This road isn't on here.

23:34.826 --> 23:37.704
That's because you don't have
the Redneck World Atlas.

23:37.788 --> 23:41.582
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. I think
we've just been saved, kids.

23:41.666 --> 23:43.793
- Can I get a...

23:51.466 --> 23:55.136
- Make this quick.

23:55.220 --> 23:57.846
Actually, maybe we
should keep walking.

23:57.930 --> 24:01.183
What? The next house is gonna have
a white picket fence?

24:01.225 --> 24:03.686
Yeah, if there is
a next house.

24:06.354 --> 24:08.564
- Hey.
- What?

24:25.913 --> 24:28.331
Hello?

24:28.415 --> 24:31.334
All right, this isn't right.

24:31.418 --> 24:33.336
Hello?

24:39.008 --> 24:41.635
Hello? Anybody home?

24:44.345 --> 24:46.431
- Whoa, baby! Could you... Shh!

24:46.514 --> 24:49.058
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

24:49.142 --> 24:52.936
I was gonna see if they had a phone.
You guys can wait out here if you want.

24:53.020 --> 24:55.606
You can't just go barging
into someone's house like that.

24:55.689 --> 24:58.441
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
I'm just thinkin'...

24:58.482 --> 25:01.152
West Virginia, trespassing...
not a great combination.

25:01.235 --> 25:03.487
Look, I need to pee.

25:03.571 --> 25:06.489
Well, I need to remind you
of a little movie called Deliverance.

25:09.784 --> 25:13.287
Guys, we got two wrecked cars.
I mean, we really need a phone.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.172
Hello?

25:24.255 --> 25:26.633
Hello?

25:26.716 --> 25:28.675
Carly.

25:34.473 --> 25:36.432
Hello?

25:52.238 --> 25:54.156
What the fuck?

25:54.240 --> 25:57.243
Let's just do
what we gotta do and get out ofhere.

26:00.245 --> 26:03.498
Hey, I am not sensing a phone here.

26:03.539 --> 26:05.791
Hello!

26:05.832 --> 26:08.460
Okay, who lives here?

26:08.502 --> 26:12.297
I don't know, but can you
help me find a bathroom?

26:12.339 --> 26:14.465
Baby, I think
this is the bathroom.

26:14.549 --> 26:19.303
Oh, fuck.

26:21.346 --> 26:24.182
Oh, my God.
Look at this place.

26:24.266 --> 26:27.018
Seriously, guys,
I think we should go.

26:27.102 --> 26:29.353
Help me find the bathroom.
Then we'll go.

26:29.395 --> 26:31.981
Baby, what if this place
belongs to some kind of cult?

26:32.022 --> 26:34.692
I read in Newsweek how
economically depressed places...

26:34.775 --> 26:37.986
are like breeding grounds for
all kinds of apocalyptic visionaries.

26:38.027 --> 26:40.822
Order of the Solar Temple, Church of
the Lamb of God, the Chijon family.

26:40.863 --> 26:43.323
- Remember them?
- Hey, brainiac!

26:43.365 --> 26:45.325
Shh!

26:46.535 --> 26:49.329
All right.
Maybe that door.

26:58.296 --> 27:00.714
- Christ!

27:00.755 --> 27:04.217
- You okay?
- It's just a paddle. It's all right.

27:08.053 --> 27:10.598
Whoa.

27:13.058 --> 27:15.685
God, look at this place.

27:15.727 --> 27:18.563
Yeah. It's like
the garage sale from hell.

27:18.646 --> 27:21.189
- Jesus.

27:23.275 --> 27:26.069
Can you believe this?

27:29.030 --> 27:32.617
Jesus, these guys
are ripping people off.

27:32.700 --> 27:37.120
I mean, this is like
$30,000 worth of stuff.

27:39.956 --> 27:42.417
- Chris.
- Mm-hmm.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.960
We should leave.

27:46.879 --> 27:49.423
This is kind of creepy.

27:53.426 --> 27:55.720
- Yeah, this is it.
- Okay. Be quick.

27:55.762 --> 27:58.431
- Okay!
- All right? Two minutes.

27:58.514 --> 28:00.599
All right?
I'll be here.

29:08.575 --> 29:10.493
Ew.!

29:52.696 --> 29:54.740
Guys, guys, check this out.

29:56.325 --> 29:57.659
Oh, no.

30:01.412 --> 30:04.498
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Scott. Scott!

30:04.540 --> 30:07.168
- - Scott, we have to go now!

30:08.752 --> 30:11.004
- Jess! Jessie!
- Jess!

30:11.046 --> 30:14.257
- Hey! Guys, what is it?
- We need to get back to your friends.

30:14.341 --> 30:15.507
- What about a phone?
- There is no phone. Shit!

30:15.507 --> 30:17.218
- What about a phone?
- There is no phone. Shit!

30:19.553 --> 30:22.889
There's a back door.
I saw a back door. Come on.

30:22.931 --> 30:24.891
- Go, go!

30:24.933 --> 30:29.729
- Okay, hurry. Shit! No!
- Shit!

30:29.812 --> 30:34.775
Scott.! Scott.!
It's not gonna budge.! Come on.!

36:47.974 --> 36:50.350
Go.

37:04.070 --> 37:05.614
Go.

37:20.710 --> 37:24.255
Go! Go!

37:24.339 --> 37:26.965
- Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

37:27.049 --> 37:29.885
- Go, you guys! Run!

37:29.927 --> 37:32.638
- Go quickly.
- Come on.

37:40.770 --> 37:43.271
- Where are they going?
- I don't know.

37:43.313 --> 37:46.733
Jesus, did that
really just happen?

37:46.775 --> 37:49.319
Do you think Evan's okay?

37:52.071 --> 37:54.824
- Please.
- I can't. I can't.

37:54.907 --> 37:56.991
Carly, come on!
Get up!

37:57.075 --> 38:00.328
You didn't see what
they did to Francine!

38:00.411 --> 38:04.457
- You didn't see what we saw!
- Carly! Carly! Sweet pea!

38:04.540 --> 38:07.084
Look at me. We are gonna
get out of this, I swear to you.

38:07.167 --> 38:10.671
We are. Okay? We're gonna find a road.
We're gonna get to a town.

38:10.754 --> 38:15.299
And we're going home.
We're gonna get married. All right?

38:15.383 --> 38:18.010
And we are never
going into the woods again.

38:19.512 --> 38:21.680
- All right?
- We gotta go.

38:21.763 --> 38:24.516
- Come on. This way!
- Let's go! Come on!

38:39.195 --> 38:41.156
What is this?

38:51.706 --> 38:53.791
Jesus.

38:55.543 --> 38:57.502
All these people.

38:59.254 --> 39:02.883
Baby. Fuck.

39:07.511 --> 39:10.848
How can they do this?
I don't understand.

39:10.931 --> 39:15.018
- How'd they get away with this?
- Oh, my God. All these people.

39:15.101 --> 39:19.022
Maybe one of them still runs.
Look for keys.

39:19.105 --> 39:21.356
None of these cars
are gonna run.

39:21.482 --> 39:25.194
Come on. Look at them.
Oh, fuck.

39:32.366 --> 39:34.535
Get down! Get down!

39:34.619 --> 39:36.411
- Come on!
- Okay.

40:10.274 --> 40:12.568
What do we do?

40:12.652 --> 40:14.861
- They left their truck running.
- So?

40:14.903 --> 40:17.531
- We gotta take it.
- How are we supposed to do that?

40:17.572 --> 40:20.575
One of us leads them
in the wrong direction...

40:20.659 --> 40:23.786
and the rest commandeer the truck
so they'll run for the runner.

40:25.538 --> 40:27.540
It's a classic military move.

40:27.581 --> 40:30.375
- Who goes?
- Me.

40:30.416 --> 40:34.212
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

40:34.254 --> 40:37.089
Over here!

40:44.637 --> 40:48.141
- Oh, shit. Oh, God.

40:50.768 --> 40:53.061
- Go!

40:53.103 --> 40:56.731
Listen. Help him. Get to the truck.
I'll meet you there.

40:56.815 --> 40:58.567
I love you.

40:58.607 --> 41:02.570
Fuckers!
Asshole motherfuckers!

41:02.653 --> 41:04.738
Assholes!

41:07.323 --> 41:09.242
He's okay. Shh, shh.

41:20.335 --> 41:22.628
Come on.

41:30.218 --> 41:32.637
Here, here. You're okay.

41:34.598 --> 41:37.475
Go ahead. Go, go, go.
Go to the truck.

41:41.270 --> 41:44.147
- Come on. We gotta go.

41:44.189 --> 41:47.442
- I can't.! I can't.!
- Come on! Come on!

41:47.484 --> 41:50.195
Carly, get in!

42:15.216 --> 42:18.511
We gotta find Scott!
We have to find Scott!

42:29.187 --> 42:31.730
Where is he?
Where is he!

42:34.942 --> 42:38.528
There he is!
There he is! Scott!

42:38.611 --> 42:42.365
Run, Scott.!
We're over here.! Scott.!

42:42.406 --> 42:45.992
- Scott.! Come on.!
- Scott, let's go!

42:46.076 --> 42:49.579
- Come on!

42:49.663 --> 42:52.873
- Come on, Scott! Scott!
- Let's go.!

42:52.915 --> 42:55.209
- Scott, come on!
- Come on, Scott!

42:55.251 --> 42:58.045
- Come on, Scott!
- Scott! Scott! What are you doing?

42:58.087 --> 43:00.672
- Scott, what's wrong?
- Scott!

43:00.755 --> 43:02.799
Scott! No!

43:02.882 --> 43:05.760
- No!

43:05.844 --> 43:10.681
Let go of me.! Let me go.!

43:10.722 --> 43:13.851
Scott.!

43:13.934 --> 43:16.853
No!

43:19.188 --> 43:21.732
Drive! Drive!

43:21.816 --> 43:24.025
- No!
- Drive!

43:31.365 --> 43:33.284
Oh, God!

43:34.910 --> 43:37.413
What's happening?

44:02.309 --> 44:05.061
Oh, God, what's happening?

44:09.065 --> 44:14.070
Jess, please,
can we go back? Please!

44:14.153 --> 44:17.614
Carly, we have to
keep going. Okay?

44:21.618 --> 44:25.621
Scott.

44:43.011 --> 44:46.097
Are you sure this is
the road from that map?

44:46.180 --> 44:48.307
It's gotta go somewhere.

44:48.390 --> 44:50.851
This better get us out of here.

44:56.481 --> 44:58.358
Shit.

45:02.945 --> 45:05.823
- Shit!
- Come on!

45:07.533 --> 45:10.952
- Back it up.

45:13.663 --> 45:17.290
- Come on!
- It's not gonna go any farther.
Come on. We have to get out.

45:21.128 --> 45:23.213
We gotta find out
where we are.

45:23.296 --> 45:25.297
The highest ridge is up there.
Come on.

45:25.339 --> 45:28.342
What's the point?
They're gonna find us anyway.

45:28.384 --> 45:32.470
- Come on. Let's go, Carly.
- No. If he's going, I'm not.
He got us into this.

45:32.512 --> 45:35.932
Carly, look at me, okay?
Scott died protecting us.

45:36.015 --> 45:39.476
We need to keep ourselves alive,
or it was for nothing. Okay?

45:39.518 --> 45:41.812
We're all in this together, Carl.

45:41.854 --> 45:43.814
Come on.

45:43.856 --> 45:46.066
I want him back.

45:46.150 --> 45:48.317
Shh.

45:50.027 --> 45:52.029
I know, I know.

45:54.614 --> 45:57.159
- Carl, look at me. Okay? Look.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.661
We're gonna stay alive.
We're gonna get out of this.

45:59.703 --> 46:04.331
We're gonna find the police and
make sure those motherfuckers
are punished for this. Okay?

46:07.960 --> 46:10.211
Carly.

46:10.253 --> 46:13.214
Come on, Carly.
You can do it.

46:14.924 --> 46:17.426
It's gonna get dark soon.
Come on.

46:21.096 --> 46:23.390
We need to find
that road quick.

46:23.432 --> 46:25.391
I know.

46:55.417 --> 46:57.378
Just a little bit farther.

47:01.882 --> 47:03.800
Chris!

47:05.718 --> 47:08.846
- It's a bear trap.

47:43.876 --> 47:46.337
- What's up?
- I gotta rest.

47:56.137 --> 47:58.097
- Hey, guys.

47:58.180 --> 48:00.641
Look.

48:02.143 --> 48:05.812
Oh my God.
It's a watchtower.

48:10.399 --> 48:12.651
- Hello! Is anyone up there?
- Shh! Shh!

48:16.363 --> 48:19.157
- I don't think anyone's up there.
- Doesn't matter.

48:19.198 --> 48:22.160
It may have a phone or a radio.
Maybe we can see the road.

48:22.243 --> 48:23.828
You okay?

48:29.124 --> 48:31.126
Come on.

49:28.008 --> 49:30.886
Guys, I don't see
any roads or towns out there.

49:30.928 --> 49:33.471
Let's not stand by the window.
They might see us.

49:41.853 --> 49:44.231
- Hey.
- We're all gonna die.

49:46.024 --> 49:49.026
Carly, I need you to come help me
look around, please.

50:03.289 --> 50:05.457
Hey, Chris.

50:25.684 --> 50:28.060
- Jess.
- Thanks.

51:06.469 --> 51:09.347
Oh, my God.
It's a radio.

51:13.475 --> 51:15.810
Thing looks prehistoric.

51:15.852 --> 51:18.605
- Do you know how to use this?
- Uh, let me try.

51:18.646 --> 51:22.274
- It could still work.
- Don't move anything.

51:22.358 --> 51:25.152
- Keep it on the frequency they had it on.
- It works.

51:25.194 --> 51:28.321
Can anybody hear me? We have
an emergency. Can anybody hear me?

51:28.404 --> 51:31.115
Say "Mayday."

51:31.199 --> 51:34.202
Look, we have a huge emergency.
Please, does anybody hear me?

51:35.535 --> 51:37.621
Someone is injured.
We need help.

51:37.662 --> 51:40.707
Hello. Please, is anybody
out there that can hear me?

51:40.791 --> 51:43.876
- Hello.
- No.

51:46.879 --> 51:50.048
Get down.
Cover the light.

51:50.131 --> 51:52.133
Shh.

52:06.270 --> 52:08.690
I think they're passing us.

52:19.824 --> 52:21.742
This is Ranger Base Emergency.
Do you copy?

52:21.826 --> 52:25.746
- What is your position? Over.

52:25.830 --> 52:28.373
Do you copy?
What is your position? Over.

52:28.456 --> 52:31.876
- I don't know my position. Just help us.
- Shh.!

52:31.960 --> 52:35.212
I need another copy of that.
I repeat. What is your position?

52:35.295 --> 52:37.423
They're coming.

52:42.802 --> 52:44.929
We don't know our position.
We're in a watchtower.

52:45.013 --> 52:47.515
We must be north
of Bear Mountain Road.

52:47.598 --> 52:51.393
Someone is trying to kill us!
They've murdered our friends!
They're after us right now!

52:51.476 --> 52:54.187
I'm having
some trouble hearing you.

52:54.271 --> 52:56.523
If you're in the tower, stay there.
Do you copy?

52:56.565 --> 52:58.899
Yes, we copy! Just hurry, please!
This is an emergency!

52:58.983 --> 53:01.777
- Help me move this. Come on! Come on!
- We'll come to you.

53:01.861 --> 53:04.280
They're after us.!
Someone's been shot.!

53:04.363 --> 53:07.532
Our friends have been killed,
and we need help.! Please.!

53:07.574 --> 53:09.909
Fuck!

53:35.390 --> 53:37.308
What are they doing?

53:37.391 --> 53:39.393
I don't know.

53:43.104 --> 53:45.648
I think they're going down.

53:45.732 --> 53:47.317
Jess.

54:02.121 --> 54:05.458
Hello? Hello?
Is anybody there?

54:05.541 --> 54:07.751
Can you hear us? Hello?

54:38.152 --> 54:41.656
- Jesus, what are they doing?
- We're on fire.

54:41.739 --> 54:44.116
They're trying to burn us out.

54:46.159 --> 54:49.204
Oh, my God.

54:59.254 --> 55:01.673
Carly.!

55:01.756 --> 55:05.301
- Come here!
- Let go of me! Let go!

55:05.343 --> 55:08.721
I'd rather jump than burn to death!

55:10.431 --> 55:13.058
- Calm down.
- You're right.

55:13.142 --> 55:15.810
- What?
- She's right.

55:15.852 --> 55:19.480
- We have to jump. Those branches
are only a few feet down.
- That's more like 20 feet.

55:19.522 --> 55:23.191
I don't want to burn, and I don't want to
be chopped into pieces. We can do this.

55:23.275 --> 55:25.402
I'll go first.

55:25.485 --> 55:27.404
Chris. Hey.

55:42.292 --> 55:46.503
Oh.

56:15.278 --> 56:18.406
Aaah! Chris!
Chris! Aaah!

56:19.532 --> 56:22.701
- Chris!

56:47.556 --> 56:50.059
- You okay?
- Do you think they saw us?

56:50.142 --> 56:53.395
I don't know.

56:59.776 --> 57:02.403
We gotta move.
Come on.

57:02.486 --> 57:04.655
Shit. Shit.

57:22.753 --> 57:24.672
Carly, come on.

58:30.647 --> 58:34.107
I can do this.
I can do this. I can do this.

58:34.191 --> 58:36.985
I can...
I can do this.

58:38.986 --> 58:41.155
- Car...

58:58.545 --> 59:00.673
- Shh.

59:03.508 --> 59:07.095
- Come on. Come on.

59:27.737 --> 59:31.199
- He's coming.
- I know. I have a plan. Come on.

59:38.747 --> 59:40.748
Jessie, this way.

01:00:04.686 --> 01:00:06.730
- Can you hold this?
- Why?

01:00:06.855 --> 01:00:10.065
'Cause we're gonna knock this fucker
out of the tree. Can you hold it?

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:15.070
- Yeah.
- All right. Don't let go
until I say so. Okay?

01:00:15.154 --> 01:00:19.073
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna make sure he comes this way.

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:21.826
- No. You can't move as quick as I can.
- Jessie.

01:00:21.909 --> 01:00:24.828
Jessie.

01:00:44.554 --> 01:00:47.681
I'm right here!
Come and get me!

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.187
Where are you?

01:00:56.689 --> 01:00:58.733
Here I am!

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:34.180
- What...

01:01:45.399 --> 01:01:48.150
- Hmm?

01:01:54.865 --> 01:01:57.742
- Hey!

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.705
Sorry about your friends.

01:03:41.457 --> 01:03:45.086
Last Friday I came home,
and there's a message on my machine...

01:03:46.254 --> 01:03:49.256
from my boyfriend, who...

01:03:49.339 --> 01:03:52.550
says that we shouldn't
be together anymore.

01:03:55.804 --> 01:04:00.224
Within 20 minutes
of me... telling Carly...

01:04:02.726 --> 01:04:07.438
she had Scott and...
Evan and Francine...

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:10.483
all blowing off work this week
to take me out here.

01:04:11.692 --> 01:04:14.152
That's just the kind
of friends they were.

01:04:17.489 --> 01:04:19.490
And now they're dead.

01:04:28.915 --> 01:04:31.167
It's not your fault.

01:04:32.961 --> 01:04:34.962
It's not.

01:05:00.735 --> 01:05:02.737
They're here!

01:05:10.493 --> 01:05:13.495
No, they're not.
You were dreaming.

01:05:15.372 --> 01:05:18.000
I wish.

01:06:02.038 --> 01:06:04.707
- How's your leg?
- It hurts.

01:06:04.791 --> 01:06:08.543
Which is good.
If it didn't hurt... Road.

01:06:08.627 --> 01:06:10.712
- What?
- Road. Look.

01:06:10.754 --> 01:06:14.423
- We gotta get down there.
- Take that slope right there.

01:06:18.219 --> 01:06:20.595
I can't believe it.

01:06:20.679 --> 01:06:24.224
- How are we gonna get you down?
- I'll get down...

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.310
- Chris!
- Go!

01:06:28.394 --> 01:06:31.564
- Chris! No! Chris!

01:06:32.648 --> 01:06:35.608
Chris.! Chris.!

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:39.654
Chris! Get off of me!

01:06:42.448 --> 01:06:44.074
- Jessie!

01:06:44.116 --> 01:06:46.994
Jessie!

01:06:56.043 --> 01:06:59.462
Hey, stop!
Oh, thank God!

01:06:59.504 --> 01:07:01.464
Are you crazy?

01:07:01.506 --> 01:07:04.342
- They took her. Come on. We gotta...
- Just calm down.

01:07:04.426 --> 01:07:07.595
- We gotta move.
- Are you one of them folks
who called me from the fire tower?

01:07:07.636 --> 01:07:11.432
- Will you shut up and listen.
People are dead!
- Dead? What people?

01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:28.466
Help.!

01:09:28.551 --> 01:09:30.594
No!

01:09:34.139 --> 01:09:37.224
- Mmm.
- No.

01:09:41.812 --> 01:09:43.898
Help me. Please.

01:09:45.273 --> 01:09:48.234
Help me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:09:48.276 --> 01:09:52.904
I'm sorry. Yeah?
Can you help me?

01:09:52.946 --> 01:09:54.990
Please help me.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.285
No!

01:09:59.827 --> 01:10:01.329
No!

01:10:17.426 --> 01:10:23.014
Help.

01:11:20.064 --> 01:11:23.024
Somebody, help me!

01:11:26.778 --> 01:11:28.822
No!

01:11:51.133 --> 01:11:52.926
Help me!

01:12:47.848 --> 01:12:51.227
- You're okay. Come on.

01:12:51.268 --> 01:12:54.729
Just stay with me. You're all right.
Come on. It's okay.

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:57.398
Keep looking at me.
All right? You're okay.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.485
- Thank you.
- Shh. Everything's okay.

01:13:05.989 --> 01:13:08.492
- Chris.!
-

01:14:00.412 --> 01:14:02.830
- Chris!

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:57.711
- Chris.

01:15:09.388 --> 01:15:12.098
- Get off of me!

01:15:25.026 --> 01:15:27.028
Shoot them.

01:15:27.111 --> 01:15:29.364
I only got one shot left.

01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:41.040
Come on, you motherfuckers.
Just die.
