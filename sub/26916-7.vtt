WEBVTT

00:11.480 --> 00:13.640
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.480
Aethelwold has made a pact with the Danes

00:16.560 --> 00:19.320
in the hope of succeeding
the ailing Alfred.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.560
I can be the bridge
between Saxon and Dane.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.200
-Return to Winchester.
-Alfred would kill me.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.720
-Aethelwold is there with the Danes?
-He is.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.560
[Uhtred] Haesten has taken
the sorceress, Skade.

00:32.720 --> 00:36.600
But she continues to hold power
over her former lord, Bloodhair.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.040
I too have been captured by her spell.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.960
She has cursed you all,
and Uhtred allows it.

00:44.040 --> 00:47.800
I will return and if you are here still,
then I will kill you.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.920
[Uhtred] I no longer
have the trust of my men.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.320
Uhtred is cursed and has lost his mind.
Are you with me or not, Dagfinn?

00:55.400 --> 00:57.800
[Uhtred] And even Sihtric has deserted me.

00:57.880 --> 01:01.960
And you are cursed once more,
Uhtred of Bebbanburg, you shall wither.

01:02.040 --> 01:06.480
[Uhtred] After the inglorious death...
of my brother, Ragnar,

01:06.560 --> 01:09.320
his spirit has been banished to Niflheim.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.040
So, with Brida I sought out
the seer, Storri,

01:12.120 --> 01:13.880
to find a way to free him.

01:14.560 --> 01:18.760
And now we must send him
to his rightful resting place: Valhalla.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.000
You must kill the man who killed Ragnar.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.960
[Uhtred] Destiny is all.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.960
[theme music playing]

02:31.200 --> 02:34.040
Oh! [laughing]

02:34.120 --> 02:36.320
-[Osferth] I need ale, slave.
-[Finan] Here.

02:41.440 --> 02:44.200
-[Osferth] What is it?
-[Finan] You mean, "who is it?"

02:45.600 --> 02:46.520
Osferth.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.480
-You're back.
-I'm back.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.440
-[both laughing]
-[Finan] That's good.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.520
[Uhtred] I'm back.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.360
-Sihtric?
-Uh, gone.

03:01.440 --> 03:06.200
Long gone and, um,
with the prisoners, Lord.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.720
-[Finan] Good journey, then?
-[Uhtred] It was.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.440
I know what I must do now.

03:13.480 --> 03:14.760
-Osferth.
-Lord.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.720
-You're still alive?
-Of course.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.000
Reaching Skade will be near impossible.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.160
She's in the middle
of 2,000 Danes or more.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.800
-It can be done.
-[Osferth] How?

03:36.280 --> 03:37.800
With God's help.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.800
I'm joking. I've yet to decide.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.160
-When?
-As soon as I am rested.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.440
When you're rested, you will walk with me.

03:47.840 --> 03:48.800
That is a command.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.560
[clears throat] Uhtred.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.280
-Sihtric's departure--
-Betrayal.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.480
It has disturbed the men.

04:06.160 --> 04:12.080
They feel that you are to share the blame.
You and your quest for Skade.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.079
Some may not want to go looking for her
all over again.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.040
Think on it.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.680
[Aethelflaed] I am provisioning your men
as you asked.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.400
You can ride in a day or less.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.320
[Uhtred] I thought you would ask me
to stay longer.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.000
No argument?

04:34.480 --> 04:36.960
-[Aethelflaed] Do you want an argument?
-I do not.

04:38.520 --> 04:42.320
My husband has written. He'll visit soon.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.000
Urgent matters, it seems.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.560
-Then I will stay until he has gone.
-No.

04:46.640 --> 04:50.440
-Your presence will make things worse.
-Worse than him wanting to kill you?

04:50.520 --> 04:51.680
I will not hide.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.760
This is my estate
and I am wise to him now.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.000
[birds chirping loudly]

04:57.080 --> 04:58.120
Uhtred?

05:01.600 --> 05:04.440
[whispers] Stop, stop. Listen.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.720
He's gone. Like smoke.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.640
You know how to use it?

05:21.960 --> 05:24.120
"Pointy end forward," as Pyrlig would say.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.640
We should divide.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.200
We divide. Pointy end forward.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.800
[shushes]

05:39.560 --> 05:40.400
[grunts]

05:40.480 --> 05:41.760
[urinating]

05:46.720 --> 05:48.360
[muffled screaming]

05:55.920 --> 05:56.760
[grunts]

05:57.920 --> 05:59.040
[grunts]

06:06.040 --> 06:07.760
[both grunting]

06:09.160 --> 06:10.680
There! Shoot, there!

06:17.720 --> 06:19.280
[both grunting]

06:29.720 --> 06:32.640
I know you. I know your face.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.440
It is a common enough face.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.960
You're of Winchester.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.360
Ask me anything
and I will give you the truth. I swear.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.200
Brave man.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.920
-I am no fool.
-[Uhtred] You were at Dunholm.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.640
You're Aethelwold's man.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.080
I am, Lord.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.360
He sent you here to do what?

07:06.120 --> 07:09.360
To... kill you, Lord.

07:09.920 --> 07:13.320
And I am glad to have failed.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.320
-[Finan] Miserably.
-I am glad!

07:16.440 --> 07:20.080
I would like to see my wife and children
once again. Is that so wrong?

07:21.240 --> 07:24.840
When we left Winchester, I did not know
we were going to the Danes.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.160
Why did Aethelwold send men
to kill Lord Uhtred?

07:29.840 --> 07:32.240
Because Uhtred
is Alfred's sword and shield.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.640
Have mercy, Lady. I had no choice.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.880
Offa, you will carry a message
to the Danes and I will let you live.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.560
Lord.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.720
Your family in Winchester
will be my hostages

07:47.280 --> 07:49.800
-should you be tempted to lose your way.
-No, Lord.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.520
[stammers] Yes, Lord.
What is the message, Lord?

07:54.360 --> 07:58.360
You will to return to Aethelwold
and to Haesten, Cnut and Bloodhair.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.880
You will tell them
that Uhtred of Bebbanburg is coming,

08:01.960 --> 08:03.000
as a shadow walker,

08:04.360 --> 08:06.480
and they will die as my brother died.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.560
I will send them all to Niflheim.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.240
I can do that, Lord. I swear.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.680
You will do that.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.120
Like Sihtric, some of you may doubt me.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.840
I understand why.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.560
There have been times
when I've doubted myself.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.159
Those times are behind me now.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.600
I am a lord without wealth, without land.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.159
I can't offer silver
or the walls of a fortress

08:40.240 --> 08:42.840
behind which you can grow fat and lazy.

08:44.039 --> 08:47.600
Follow me and I will take you down
a hard, brutal path.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.040
But it is a path
that leads to the one thing

08:51.120 --> 08:55.200
every true warrior desires: reputation.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.000
Follow me and you will
have my sword and my oath.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.440
For whether you are Dane or Saxon,

09:03.320 --> 09:07.280
I swear I will die
to protect each and every one of you.

09:09.360 --> 09:14.400
My mind is clear about what must be done,
but I cannot do it without you.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.880
[church bells tolling]

10:22.040 --> 10:23.040
What now?

10:24.560 --> 10:27.240
I'm sure whatever it is,
it will not be the end of me.

10:27.720 --> 10:32.320
It is Aethelwold, Lord. He has returned.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.720
Father Pyrlig,
I wish to speak to the king.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.760
I wish to speak to him.
I will not stop asking!

10:43.840 --> 10:45.600
-Father Beocca then.
-He's occupied.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.280
Then any member of the witan!
Edward, even!

10:50.520 --> 10:54.160
-They say he is about to marry.
-[chuckles] You'll be dead by then, Lord.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.560
Then I make my plea to you.
I am misunderstood!

10:58.840 --> 11:01.200
Your time would be better spent in prayer.

11:02.520 --> 11:06.920
Alfred is in danger from those
who would do harm to Wessex.

11:07.480 --> 11:08.800
Men like yourself?

11:09.480 --> 11:12.000
If that is true,
then why have I returned alone?

11:12.920 --> 11:14.360
Without a sword!

11:14.440 --> 11:16.440
[stammers] I tossed it away at the gate!

11:18.000 --> 11:19.600
Without a hope!

11:21.600 --> 11:23.800
[Finan] Why warn the Danes
that we're coming?

11:23.880 --> 11:25.560
[Uhtred] Who asks? The men or you?

11:25.640 --> 11:28.200
[Finan] I'm asking,
but the men would like to know.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.600
[Uhtred] To worry them.
They know I am coming,

11:30.680 --> 11:32.040
but they do not know when.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.840
It will give them sleepless nights,
and when they do sleep,

11:35.920 --> 11:38.400
I want them to dream of a cold, cold hell.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.080
[Osferth] Hell is a place of fire, Lord.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.520
Uh, what are you doing?

11:43.600 --> 11:46.880
Did you believe you were leaving
without me? Not a chance.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.760
[Skade sighs] What do you want of me?

12:31.360 --> 12:32.880
There are things I would know.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.000
This undertaking, Wessex...

12:36.800 --> 12:40.040
When the signs are favorable
and we eventually attack,

12:40.600 --> 12:42.560
which one of us Danes will earn glory?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.960
You saw the death of Alfred.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.680
You said it was me
who took him from his horse

12:50.760 --> 12:52.640
and took an ax to his heart.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.920
I drank with you, more than once.

13:02.920 --> 13:06.320
Then you left me to be passed
from man to man like a drinking cup.

13:06.800 --> 13:11.080
Each of you is as unworthy as the next.

13:11.160 --> 13:14.800
Haesten wants you only to hump.
He doesn't believe in your power.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.840
You abandoned me. Your path has changed.

13:16.920 --> 13:20.400
Yes, I failed you once.
I would not do it again.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.040
Haesten cannot match me,
in strength or in spirit.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.560
And yet, I am his.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.480
He cannot make you a queen.
Only I can defeat Alfred.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.840
Alfred is now destined to die in his bed.

13:39.240 --> 13:41.080
Only I can defeat Uhtred.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.120
You know it to be true.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.680
I have never lied to you, Sigurd.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.520
What you wish for and who you wish for...

13:51.600 --> 13:53.880
It can never be real
while Haesten is alive.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.080
You must kill him.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.600
You like to look?

14:14.520 --> 14:15.960
Why is she eating with us?

14:16.040 --> 14:20.560
Because Bloodhair likes to look
and that is all he can do.

14:20.640 --> 14:21.840
She's trouble.

14:23.000 --> 14:23.920
You wish me dead?

14:26.560 --> 14:28.200
That would benefit whom?

14:29.240 --> 14:31.680
Each of us. All of us.

14:32.560 --> 14:36.760
Including Uhtred. Did he ride you so well
that you now speak for him?

14:36.840 --> 14:39.840
-[laughs]
-You bore me, witch.

14:42.880 --> 14:47.520
Sihtric, answer me this:
does Uhtred wish me dead?

14:49.400 --> 14:53.080
He is undecided. He does not know
if he should hump you or kill you.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.600
[chuckles]

14:56.200 --> 14:58.840
-[Sihtric] He's afraid of you.
-Because she's poison.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.040
She has you all by the balls. Believe it.

15:09.160 --> 15:11.680
-Is Brida your woman or not?
-Soon.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.920
I'm the reason she has returned.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.600
-Soon?
-Her men will be my men.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.680
Tell her to hold her tongue.

15:20.480 --> 15:24.480
You should tell her about your wife,
across the sea.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.520
[laughing]

15:27.280 --> 15:29.640
You betrayed Uhtred. Why?

15:30.320 --> 15:32.440
He's losing men and losing his mind.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.040
Will he come for my woman?

15:37.040 --> 15:39.280
He is afraid of the curse.
He wants it gone.

15:40.120 --> 15:44.160
Yes, he will come, I'm certain.
But he is not the warrior he once was.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.160
Maybe he's more dangerous now.

15:48.440 --> 15:53.360
More reckless, Lord. Unable to plan.
That is why I'm here.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.680
[Cnut] I've given you time enough,
I think.

16:03.760 --> 16:07.200
To sit at a graveside, to roam the land.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.080
-When?
-When what?

16:11.920 --> 16:15.280
When will your men become our men?

16:17.040 --> 16:20.080
A union will make us greater
than Haesten and Bloodhair.

16:20.160 --> 16:23.560
That's no achievement.
They're led by their cocks.

16:23.640 --> 16:24.920
They only think of Skade.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.800
Whereas I think of nothing but Brida.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.800
Let them dream of the seer.
Let them turn on each other.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.080
A split may be to our advantage.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.080
And so I ask...

16:43.920 --> 16:44.840
when?

16:48.520 --> 16:49.560
Tonight.

16:50.600 --> 16:51.560
Now.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.119
Edward, be sure not to fidget.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.640
There's no need to fret.
Your standing has never been greater.

17:18.720 --> 17:23.040
Mother, I'm not fretting.
I'm hoping she is fair.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.800
I'm sure Aelflaed will prove
a fitting match.

17:29.760 --> 17:30.600
Stand upright.

17:36.120 --> 17:40.560
-Lord King. Lady.
-Ealdorman Aethelhelm, Edward you've met.

17:40.640 --> 17:41.800
I have.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.200
May I present my daughter, Aelflaed.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.400
Are the couple to remain
during negotiations,

17:51.480 --> 17:55.000
or should they retire to another room?
Under supervision, of course.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.880
[Aelswith] An excellent idea, Lord.

17:56.960 --> 18:00.760
Edward, perhaps you could
show the Lady Aelflaed the courtyard.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.240
A peaceful place.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.640
I suggest we get down to the haggling.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.360
-May I sit?
-Yes, of course.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.040
I do enjoy a haggle.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.920
You have no reason to be afraid
of the palace or Winchester.

18:29.400 --> 18:33.040
It is my hope
that we can find a happiness.

18:36.600 --> 18:40.480
I will give you no reason to fear me,
if fear is the reason for your silence.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.520
I'm not afraid, Lord.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.560
But words are a torment at times.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.520
I do not wish to say something foolish.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.600
I'm sure you will not.

18:52.480 --> 18:53.760
My father fears it.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.960
He said so again and again,
all the way from Wiltunscir.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.960
Or perhaps I should not have said that?

19:02.240 --> 19:07.240
I think your father and my mother both
could learn about the value of silence.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.480
I worry, too. About words.

19:11.560 --> 19:15.520
I cannot be sure
if mine carry weight. Not yet.

19:16.840 --> 19:20.000
When I am king,
I must choose them with care.

19:21.960 --> 19:25.360
I would be in good company
with a wife who does the same.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.200
Forgive my candor, Lord, but to me,

19:31.920 --> 19:35.440
the bride price you offer
for my daughter seems low.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.640
As does Edward's morning gift to her.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.200
I believe both offers generous silver.
She is to wed a future king.

19:42.920 --> 19:48.120
The morning gift is her protection
against dangers that lie ahead.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.120
Those we know and those
that have yet to reveal themselves.

19:54.600 --> 19:59.360
I mean no insult to you when I say,
Edward is not you.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.800
He is not yet king.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.120
That is the witan's decision.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.400
He proved himself at Beamfleot
and none would say otherwise.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.600
I do not doubt it.

20:08.680 --> 20:12.640
He led as a king would.
His choices were his own.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.080
[Aethelhelm] Nevertheless.

20:14.840 --> 20:20.320
The time when power passes from an elder
to a younger king is fraught with danger.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.680
Things may change for Wessex.

20:26.520 --> 20:27.360
Speak plainly.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.280
I thought I had, Lord.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.800
Others lay claim to your throne.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.520
Your nephew, Aethelwold, is one.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.840
Aethelwold is imprisoned
and will be dealt with.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.640
Edward will be king.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.400
But there is risk, Lord.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.360
That is my point.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.680
What of my daughter's safety then?

20:52.760 --> 20:56.680
The wedding gifts should fit the risk.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.560
Aethelwold is no threat to Edward.

20:59.640 --> 21:03.480
He is a traitor, and will be punished
with the utmost severity.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.640
Aelflaed is in no danger,

21:05.720 --> 21:10.640
but I understand your deep love
for your daughter.

21:12.240 --> 21:15.640
As a mark of goodwill,
I will raise the bride price by a third.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.760
That is near enough silver
to pave Wiltunscir, is it not?

21:22.680 --> 21:23.720
Thank you, Lord.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.120
[Bloodhair] Message from Mercia.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.000
-[Cnut] What's this?
-A message from the Dane-slayer.

21:33.880 --> 21:34.880
Uhtred sent you?

21:36.040 --> 21:36.880
He did, Lady.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.720
And his message is what?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.880
He says he will come for you, Lord.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.640
For all of you.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.880
In the night, as a shadow walker.

21:53.640 --> 21:57.120
He says you will die, as Ragnar died.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.000
He says...

22:01.880 --> 22:04.000
he will send you all to Niflheim.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.360
-I say, let him come.
-Yes.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.560
Feed his guts to Odin's ravens.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.840
I'll make a sacrifice
of the Saxon bastard.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.040
You should have done that at Fearnham.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.040
I hear a rat's wheeze.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.760
I said, if you wished
to make a sacrifice of Uhtred,

22:20.360 --> 22:23.840
you should have done it at Fearnham.
But you chose to run.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.320
Haesten, no.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.960
Mind how you speak.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.680
Oh, you fled, did you not? Ran away.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.720
-[Cnut] Bloodhair, say nothing.
-I lost men in battle.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.920
You lost men in a fortress.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.400
Though I managed to keep hold of my woman.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.080
[Bloodhair] Shut your mouth.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.720
-[Haesten] Shall I show you how I bed her?
-Shut it!

22:42.800 --> 22:47.000
[chuckles] Come on.
Come on, Bloodhair. I'll be gentle.

22:48.040 --> 22:52.080
Come to Haesten,
and I will whelp some pups on you.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.520
-We make this square, you and I.
-Bloodhair, no! Enough of this.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.400
Do you want me to hump you
in the square, Bloodhair?

22:58.480 --> 23:02.200
-We fight! We fight now!
-If that is what you want, then yes!

23:02.280 --> 23:04.280
-[Bloodhair] Fight me!
-Haesten! No more!

23:04.360 --> 23:06.600
-I'll cut your heart out!
-Prepare!

23:06.680 --> 23:07.880
I'm ready!

23:09.000 --> 23:10.160
I'm ready.

23:10.240 --> 23:11.240
[yells]

23:14.800 --> 23:15.720
Square, then.

23:27.080 --> 23:30.360
I'm noticing this village is different
to the others we've passed.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.000
It prospers.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.800
[Finan] In the heart of Danelaw,
it prospers.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.120
[Uhtred chuckles]

23:36.200 --> 23:38.160
I have a thirst, my friends.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.800
[Finan] Everyone here
is as fat as a buttered bishop.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.080
-A buttered bishop?
-A buttered bishop.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.960
Do you have a problem with that?

23:58.320 --> 23:59.440
[man] You!

24:01.920 --> 24:02.920
Who are you?

24:05.320 --> 24:06.200
Who are you?

24:06.280 --> 24:08.960
I am Guthlac, thegn of this place.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.360
I am Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.400
Never heard of it.

24:14.480 --> 24:18.920
We serve the Lady Aethelflaed.
And thus, Mercia. As do you, no doubt.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.200
-We are Mercians, yes.
-Fat Mercians.

24:23.320 --> 24:25.720
-What is it you want?
-Food and ale.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.960
A place to sleep, rest a while.

24:28.640 --> 24:31.480
I'd hope that our beds
will be warmer than your welcome.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.080
No swords.

24:34.680 --> 24:38.480
Leave your weapons with your horses.
My doors will be open to you.

24:39.200 --> 24:43.400
I will not give you my sword,
but you have my word.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.840
We're here for food, ale and rest,
nothing else.

24:45.920 --> 24:49.600
Very well, but be warned,
we don't take kindly to--

24:49.680 --> 24:52.160
-Strangers with swords?
-[Guthlac] Yes, that.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.920
And now he will send
a messenger to the Danes,

25:00.800 --> 25:02.440
which could be to our advantage.

25:05.160 --> 25:07.560
[Aethelred] This is fine land
I gifted my wife.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.440
One day, I should like to take it back.

25:11.360 --> 25:13.000
With her buried underneath it.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.120
You are to make her like you, Aldhelm.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.840
To what end, Lord?

25:21.720 --> 25:23.840
-Hump her, if you wish.
-[chuckles]

25:24.640 --> 25:26.480
To what end, Lord?

25:26.560 --> 25:29.040
Bed her and then I shall divorce her.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.800
You are to become my spy.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.600
Your proposal is unacceptable.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.680
Nevertheless, 30 men will be sent here
to guard you.

25:40.760 --> 25:41.600
Your men.

25:42.160 --> 25:47.600
Outlaws did enter your estate, my dear.
An attempt was made on your life.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.040
Do you want to be absolved

25:49.120 --> 25:51.600
of your responsibilities for my safety
in writing?

25:53.440 --> 25:55.520
My guard is adequate.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.000
Where's your daughter?

25:59.360 --> 26:00.760
The half Dane?

26:01.320 --> 26:04.200
-Your daughter is not half Dane.
-She looks like a Dane.

26:04.280 --> 26:05.120
[snickers]

26:08.760 --> 26:10.680
Do we amuse you, Aldhelm?

26:10.760 --> 26:14.520
Well, I was briefly thinking, Lord,
that you, too, look like a Dane.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.640
[snorts]

26:22.120 --> 26:23.680
This food is intolerable.

26:26.560 --> 26:27.400
I have to vomit.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.800
Do not rile him, Lady.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.720
He is more dangerous than you know.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.080
I am to make you like me.

26:46.840 --> 26:50.600
-Should I sing you a song?
-[chuckles] Another time, perhaps.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.360
I admire you, Lady.

26:56.760 --> 26:57.960
More than that, even.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.920
Accept Aethelred's offer of men,
half the number.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.680
I will choose them myself, and they
will be loyal to you alone. I swear.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.640
I am beginning to believe
you are a good man, Lord Aldhelm.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.080
Not quite, Lady.

27:48.920 --> 27:49.760
It's warm still.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.160
Does he know you're here?

28:03.920 --> 28:05.240
It does not matter.

28:06.520 --> 28:07.360
You know me.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.120
You believe in me.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.480
All I want...

28:15.000 --> 28:16.320
is your victory.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.120
You must win me.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.480
You will be mine once again.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.200
He's slow on his feet. He cannot win.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.880
-He must not win.
-He will not win, I swear.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.600
He cannot win. Never.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.600
I must go.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.640
I must go.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.720
[Danes cheering]

29:12.800 --> 29:14.400
Come on!

29:17.400 --> 29:18.840
[Cnut] It is to the death.

29:22.080 --> 29:26.480
-[grunts]
-Valhalla awaits one man.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.560
[Danes cheering]

29:32.720 --> 29:35.640
-Are you ready?
-[Danes cheering]

29:36.880 --> 29:37.760
[Cnut] Then...

29:39.560 --> 29:41.400
-begin.
-[Danes cheering]

29:55.680 --> 29:56.600
[yelling]

30:05.480 --> 30:06.560
Oh!

30:06.640 --> 30:08.280
Who do you wish to see win?

30:09.480 --> 30:10.680
[Danes shouting]

30:11.480 --> 30:13.280
I am destined for neither.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.360
[yelling]

30:41.240 --> 30:42.720
[laughs]

30:46.320 --> 30:48.080
-[Dane] Come on, Bloodhair!
-[yells]

30:55.280 --> 30:56.320
[yells]

30:59.520 --> 31:01.000
[groans]

31:16.400 --> 31:18.320
[yelling]

31:54.040 --> 31:55.040
Come.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.160
Come.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.480
Come to Haesten!

32:12.520 --> 32:13.480
[yelling]

32:22.040 --> 32:23.840
She is poison to all men.

32:31.800 --> 32:32.800
[exhales]

32:40.560 --> 32:41.800
[Cnut] We will bury him.

32:44.120 --> 32:44.960
As a warrior.

32:46.720 --> 32:51.040
He is feasting in the great halls
with our fathers!

32:55.240 --> 32:56.400
Bury him.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.600
[Guthlac] Stay together.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.320
[laughing]

33:05.800 --> 33:08.640
I had more fun
at the burying of my father.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.800
-You knew your father?
-I knew his fist.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.080
[Osferth] They are here.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.200
I see you watching.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.280
[Mercian] Round the back.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.560
Tell our visitor, Uhtred,
he is surrounded.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.360
Men with weapons, Lord. Some with bows.

33:27.440 --> 33:30.280
He has sent his messenger.
Now he plans to keep us here.

33:30.360 --> 33:33.040
Inside an alehouse?
I can think of worse places.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.640
[both laugh]

33:35.400 --> 33:38.440
Guthlac belongs to the Danes.
They will hear we're trapped

33:38.520 --> 33:39.880
and will ride to kill us.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.560
Which is good.
There will be less men at their camp.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.360
-We are a distraction.
-And we are surrounded.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.240
-Watch that door.
-[man] Lord.

33:50.880 --> 33:51.920
Osferth.

33:55.640 --> 33:58.000
Uhtred, I wish only to talk.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.280
-Then talk.
-I do not wish to fight.

34:01.960 --> 34:05.440
[Uhtred] That is a shame. Nothing
finishes an evening in an alehouse

34:05.520 --> 34:08.120
-so well as a fight.
-Uh, maybe a woman?

34:08.199 --> 34:09.480
[Uhtred] Maybe a woman.

34:09.560 --> 34:12.800
You are outnumbered. There is no way out,
and we have bows.

34:13.800 --> 34:15.040
You should yield.

34:15.679 --> 34:19.520
Yield and your men will live.
They only want Uhtred.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.400
You're a traitor, Guthlac.

34:21.480 --> 34:26.199
[Guthlac] You cannot escape!
I say it again. We only want Uhtred.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.880
You are all free men, free to choose.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.679
[all] We're with you, Lord.

34:31.760 --> 34:32.840
Bar the door.

34:38.920 --> 34:39.880
Ladies.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.920
We cannot climb out, Lord.
The bowmen will have us.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.400
Throw me that ax.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.320
[Finan] What now, Lord?

34:57.880 --> 34:59.840
-[Uhtred] Bring me fire.
-Quickly.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.520
-He just loves burning things.
-He'd love hell.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.000
[Uhtred] Finan.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.000
[Guthlac] Fire!

35:26.080 --> 35:28.400
[men shouting indistinctly]

35:31.080 --> 35:31.920
The roof!

35:35.040 --> 35:36.640
Get water! Save the place!

35:39.680 --> 35:42.840
Stand! Come on! Stand with me!

35:42.920 --> 35:45.360
-[horse whinnies]
-[Guthlac] Cowards!

35:47.040 --> 35:49.240
-More.
-[Finan] More?

35:49.320 --> 35:52.280
-We shall burn the village if we must.
-Lord.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.880
[shouting continues]

35:59.240 --> 36:00.920
Save the alehouse!

36:08.560 --> 36:11.520
Spare me, Lord. Spare me.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.360
The Danes made me comply. I had no choice.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.760
Never forget!

36:18.000 --> 36:21.040
-[groans]
-You serve the Lady of Mercia.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.280
First and last.

36:38.120 --> 36:40.880
[Cnut] Haesten! Haesten!

36:43.840 --> 36:46.080
Uhtred is near.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.040
So he comes for us.

36:49.120 --> 36:52.840
And he is trapped
by the thegn of a village upriver.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.560
I would say we should kill him together,
but one of us must remain here.

36:58.680 --> 37:02.600
Then, he is yours to kill, my friend.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.240
Go and make your reputation.

37:05.320 --> 37:06.920
[both laugh]

37:13.120 --> 37:15.520
We have a Dane-slayer to kill.

37:32.320 --> 37:35.760
[Pyrlig] The witan has gathered
and will hear your plea, Lord.

37:40.080 --> 37:41.920
That is what you wanted.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.560
[Aethelwold] I'm glad to be home,
Lord King.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.000
I hadn't expected this welcome--

38:00.080 --> 38:03.520
Aethelwold, you are accused of conspiring

38:03.600 --> 38:06.000
with the Danes to ride
against Wessex and Mercia.

38:06.920 --> 38:10.920
I understand that is how it appears,
but that is not the truth of the matter.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.720
Father Beocca.

38:14.880 --> 38:18.560
When I traveled to Ragnar Ragnarson's
fortress at Dunholm,

38:19.440 --> 38:21.960
it was Aethelwold himself who welcomed me.

38:22.040 --> 38:24.240
I was pleased to see you, Father Beocca.

38:24.320 --> 38:29.320
He rested easy in the company of Danes,
even as they made plans to take Wessex.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.040
Though I was in fear of my life.

38:31.120 --> 38:35.600
In East Anglia, he was seen with
the Danes Sigurd Bloodhair and Haesten.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.200
And Cnut.

38:37.280 --> 38:40.440
You. You have made an agreement
with these Danes

38:40.520 --> 38:43.720
to seat yourself on this very throne
as their puppet.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.520
-[people murmuring]
-[sighs]

38:47.400 --> 38:48.480
What do you say?

38:50.480 --> 38:53.480
Lord, I was among the Danes
and do not deny it.

38:54.640 --> 38:57.680
But the story
is not as Father Beocca tells it.

38:57.760 --> 39:01.600
You are fond of stories.
What would you have us believe this time?

39:03.880 --> 39:06.720
Lord, through your guidance,
I have grown into a man.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.720
I served you well in battle, did I not?

39:12.800 --> 39:16.000
I went to spy on the Danes,
to bring their secrets to Wessex.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.400
[people muttering]

39:18.480 --> 39:19.880
[Alfred] We will hear him!

39:25.320 --> 39:27.160
I journeyed to Dunholm,

39:27.240 --> 39:30.760
told the Danes lies to make them believe
I had turned on you, Lord.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.640
They brought me into their trust
and revealed their plans.

39:37.480 --> 39:38.760
Uhtred was there.

39:40.760 --> 39:44.520
In truth, it is Uhtred
who has betrayed us.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.760
My own sin was vanity, not treachery.

39:48.840 --> 39:51.800
Uhtred did return to Mercia.

39:51.880 --> 39:54.280
He served us well once again at Beamfleot.

39:54.360 --> 39:57.520
We are here to discuss
Aethelwold's misdeeds, not Uhtred's.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.000
I cannot say during my time
with the Danes,

40:00.080 --> 40:02.920
I was never tempted
by the apple that was offered.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.960
But I realized as I watched them,
that they are...

40:09.560 --> 40:10.800
heathen.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.920
The things they did,
they have unnatural tastes.

40:17.800 --> 40:18.960
Hair.

40:21.400 --> 40:25.000
I could never give myself over to them
and came to warn you, Lord.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.240
-Advise, you even.
-[Aelswith scoffs]

40:30.640 --> 40:32.880
[Aethelwold] I have come
to stand beside you.

40:34.040 --> 40:38.720
And they allowed you to simply walk out
of their camp with no resistance?

40:39.480 --> 40:41.880
Uh, I do not know you,

40:42.680 --> 40:47.240
but I was not allowed
to walk from their camp, not quite.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.640
I told them I'd kill Uhtred.

40:52.720 --> 40:55.640
They fear him, as they should.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.720
He is a danger to us all.

41:00.280 --> 41:03.880
If you did go to spy on the Danes,

41:04.800 --> 41:07.280
why didn't you inform the king
of your intentions?

41:07.360 --> 41:10.920
Lord, who knows what secrets
may have slipped from his tongue?

41:11.920 --> 41:15.600
He must be tried. And he must be executed.

41:15.680 --> 41:16.880
[people murmuring]

41:21.080 --> 41:23.960
What secrets of the Danes
do you claim to have discovered?

41:26.120 --> 41:27.720
They await your death, Lord.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.560
They wish to exploit the chaos thereafter.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.920
[people murmuring]

41:34.000 --> 41:39.320
I wish to swear allegiance...
to the aetheling, Edward.

41:59.240 --> 42:02.400
The king wishes to pray on this matter.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.960
I wish you'd remained with the Danes.

42:39.680 --> 42:42.480
He speaks to you, Lord King?

42:44.160 --> 42:46.560
[Alfred] I have asked but found no answer.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.400
[Aelswith] The witan is waiting.

42:53.840 --> 42:56.160
I should have done more
to stop him straying.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.480
You did all you could, Lord.

42:59.240 --> 43:02.760
What could anyone do for a creature
like Aethelwold? He lacks purpose.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.560
I should have provided purpose.

43:05.360 --> 43:07.440
It seems he has found it himself.

43:09.280 --> 43:12.040
He is weak. Accept it.

43:12.800 --> 43:16.280
He stinks of vice. He was rotten
from the moment he entered the world.

43:16.360 --> 43:19.200
Aethelwold's failings were born
from my own.

43:21.280 --> 43:23.920
Yet it falls to me
to exact judgment on him.

43:24.560 --> 43:28.040
No man could have been
more forgiving than you.

43:29.240 --> 43:30.840
Not even his own father.

43:31.920 --> 43:33.640
My brother, who I loved.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.160
Who am I to take his son's life?

43:39.040 --> 43:41.760
Wickedness must be repaid.

43:47.160 --> 43:50.120
Perhaps God should judge
his servant Aethelwold.

43:54.200 --> 43:58.200
He cannot live, Lord.
Men will think you weak--

43:58.280 --> 44:00.960
So I must take my nephew's life
to prove otherwise?

44:04.600 --> 44:08.840
And to step from the Christian path
of mercy this close to the end?

44:18.640 --> 44:21.000
Might I find the gates of heaven
closed to me?

44:22.640 --> 44:24.360
Never, Lord.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.560
Aethelwold is a man
who believes himself to be king.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.880
He is a danger to Edward...

44:38.520 --> 44:40.520
to your own son.

44:51.360 --> 44:53.560
Cnut and only Cnut.

44:55.320 --> 44:58.120
That's good enough. Less men at the camp.

45:04.680 --> 45:06.680
[indistinct chatter]

45:08.960 --> 45:10.280
Sigebriht, thank you.

45:17.400 --> 45:18.440
May I ask...

45:20.000 --> 45:21.960
how is the girl you once loved?

45:23.680 --> 45:25.400
-Ecgwynn, is it?
-It is.

45:27.120 --> 45:28.600
She is confined to a nunnery.

45:30.240 --> 45:33.440
[Aethelwold] And Edward weds another
without a care, it appears.

45:36.200 --> 45:40.800
I would understand it entirely
if you could not serve him.

45:42.320 --> 45:44.560
But do men like you and me have a choice?

45:44.640 --> 45:46.760
-[door opens]
-[Beocca] The king.

46:01.880 --> 46:02.840
Come forward.

46:09.600 --> 46:14.200
Aethelwold... I am glad
that you have come home.

46:16.200 --> 46:17.440
I have no other, Lord.

46:18.560 --> 46:21.160
I have decided, in part,
to accept your word.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.440
[people murmuring]

46:22.520 --> 46:23.760
Thank you, Lord.

46:23.840 --> 46:26.760
What you say is true.
The Danes are not like us, not yet.

46:28.640 --> 46:30.200
We live by God's laws.

46:32.360 --> 46:38.320
And he has bestowed on us
uncountable blessings and untold mercies.

46:40.040 --> 46:41.920
Wessex is a sacred place...

46:43.040 --> 46:44.960
a place of home and harvest...

46:46.640 --> 46:47.920
of fairness...

46:50.360 --> 46:51.200
and pity.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.520
All that we love...

47:05.360 --> 47:08.680
all that we have built is here.

47:10.800 --> 47:13.760
This land which holds
the promise of England.

47:16.920 --> 47:19.520
That is what you have put in danger.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.040
For turning an eye to the Danes,

47:28.040 --> 47:29.400
the punishment...

47:31.040 --> 47:31.880
is blinding.

47:31.960 --> 47:33.960
[all exclaiming]

47:35.120 --> 47:36.640
Lord, you cannot mean it.

47:38.200 --> 47:42.280
[stammering] Lord, you cannot mean it.
Lord King...

47:42.360 --> 47:44.080
To see is to be wise.

47:46.120 --> 47:48.520
A king sees with both eyes.

47:50.080 --> 47:54.280
Aethelwold should lose both, but I will
be merciful. Only one eye will be taken.

47:56.280 --> 47:59.480
Aethelwold may use the other
to find the path to redemption.

47:59.560 --> 48:00.520
No!

48:02.000 --> 48:04.320
Lord, please.

48:04.880 --> 48:07.040
I have repented. I'm at your mercy.

48:07.120 --> 48:10.080
I have confessed my sins.
Please, Lord. Uncle...

48:10.160 --> 48:11.640
-Steapa.
-Please.

48:11.720 --> 48:15.000
No, no, no, no. No, Lord!

48:15.520 --> 48:19.560
No, please, no! No, no, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, please!

48:20.200 --> 48:22.000
Please! No!

48:34.840 --> 48:36.440
Once night falls,

48:36.520 --> 48:39.400
even the king of shadow walkers
would find no place here.

48:43.120 --> 48:44.400
[Finan] Someone's coming.

48:49.960 --> 48:51.240
[Osferth] It is Sihtric.

48:59.720 --> 49:01.320
You have something to say to me?

49:02.360 --> 49:03.360
I do.

49:06.240 --> 49:07.160
Yield to me.

49:14.760 --> 49:16.520
[both laughing]

49:17.200 --> 49:20.640
You were playing us.
My goodness, they were playing us, Finan!

49:21.280 --> 49:22.720
-Why?
-[laughing]

49:22.800 --> 49:25.080
If you had not believed it,
nor would others.

49:25.160 --> 49:27.040
-[Sihtric] I fooled you.
-No, I knew.

49:27.120 --> 49:29.120
No, you did not. Was I good?

49:29.200 --> 49:30.480
[Osferth] A little.

49:30.560 --> 49:33.040
-I'm telling you, I knew.
-[all laughing]

49:34.800 --> 49:36.400
[Finan] I hope it was worth it.

49:36.480 --> 49:38.760
-[Sihtric] I hope so, too.
-What do you know?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.600
We saw Cnut on the road.

49:41.680 --> 49:43.320
Only Haesten is at the camp.

49:44.040 --> 49:44.880
Bloodhair?

49:45.640 --> 49:46.480
Dead.

49:47.720 --> 49:50.360
He fought with Haesten
and was killed by Skade.

49:50.440 --> 49:51.360
Good Jesus.

49:51.440 --> 49:53.320
She's a witch like no other.

49:54.880 --> 49:56.000
She knows I'm near?

49:56.080 --> 49:58.200
She knows of your promise to shadow-walk,

49:58.280 --> 49:59.840
but there are too many guards.

50:01.680 --> 50:06.400
She is allowed to collect grass and herbs
by a tree for her spells.

50:06.480 --> 50:09.080
-A tree?
-It's a single tree

50:09.160 --> 50:11.640
on the other side of the camp.
You cannot miss it.

50:13.200 --> 50:15.560
Tell her I'm here
and take her there tonight.

50:16.760 --> 50:19.360
And if she refuses?
If Haesten prevents her?

50:19.920 --> 50:23.160
She will not refuse
and Haesten will not refuse her.

50:24.840 --> 50:25.880
[both chuckle]

50:25.960 --> 50:29.280
You have never failed me, Sihtric.
I will see you at the tree.

50:31.160 --> 50:33.440
Let's go. Finan.

51:04.880 --> 51:07.120
[breathing shakily]

51:30.840 --> 51:32.840
[muffled screaming]

51:46.480 --> 51:48.480
[screaming continues]

52:18.200 --> 52:20.160
[Skade] I knew you'd come for me, Lord.

52:23.240 --> 52:24.160
I'm ready.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.160
-I am ready.
-I'm ready.

52:32.120 --> 52:33.160
[Haesten] Skade!

52:34.040 --> 52:35.640
-Can you hear me?
-It is Haesten!

52:35.720 --> 52:37.600
-Kill him for me.
-Not now. Run!

52:37.680 --> 52:40.800
He is here, Lord! Uhtred is here!

52:40.880 --> 52:42.000
With me! Now!

52:42.080 --> 52:45.160
-[Finan] Uhtred, run!
-[Sihtric] There are ships on the river!

52:45.240 --> 52:47.320
[Uhtred] To the river. Sihtric, you lead.

52:47.920 --> 52:48.840
Move!

52:54.880 --> 52:56.480
[Sihtric] We are under attack!

52:56.560 --> 52:58.560
Haesten says to ready the ships!

52:59.520 --> 53:01.800
Now! Untie them now!

53:02.880 --> 53:04.000
[Finan] Come on!

53:14.880 --> 53:16.640
Sihtric, the boat!

53:23.680 --> 53:25.840
Make sure it doesn't list, lads!

53:28.480 --> 53:29.720
Prepare the oars!

53:30.400 --> 53:31.680
Ready the oars!

53:37.600 --> 53:39.000
Steady the oars!

53:41.520 --> 53:44.200
-And pull!
-Pull!

53:44.920 --> 53:47.680
And pull!

53:48.240 --> 53:51.000
-[Haesten] Archers, quickly!
-[Finan] Pull!

53:51.080 --> 53:52.760
Pull like a darn slave!

53:52.840 --> 53:53.760
Pull!

53:54.320 --> 53:58.280
[Finan] Pull! And pull!

53:58.960 --> 54:00.240
Pull!

54:00.760 --> 54:02.680
And pull!

54:03.280 --> 54:04.800
And pull!
