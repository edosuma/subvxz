02:25.114 --> 02:27.032
Are we the first?

02:29.910 --> 02:32.287
Are we the first to arrive here?

03:13.454 --> 03:15.539
Is the interpreter with you?

03:16.665 --> 03:21.628
I'm not a professional interpreter.
My occupation is cartography.

03:22.254 --> 03:23.630
I'm a mapmaker.

03:23.839 --> 03:26.759
Can you translate French into English
and English into French?

03:26.967 --> 03:30.137
Yes, I explained to the team leader
in Villa Hermosa.

03:30.346 --> 03:32.640
I'm just a little taken by surprise.

03:58.332 --> 04:01.335
They're all there! All of them!

04:12.680 --> 04:14.932
Check for landing marks!

04:39.790 --> 04:43.502
Mr. Lacombe wants the numbers
off the engine blocks!

04:46.797 --> 04:49.717
M-447148!

04:49.925 --> 04:54.305
W-445529!

04:54.596 --> 04:57.975
Number 445529, check!

04:58.183 --> 05:02.730
Approximately 46 gallons
in the right tank!

05:02.938 --> 05:04.773
447149, check!

05:05.024 --> 05:07.318
Tell me something.
What's happening here?

05:07.568 --> 05:09.903
- It's flight number 19!
- 19 what?

05:10.154 --> 05:13.907
It's that training mission from the
naval air station at Fort Lauderdale.

05:14.408 --> 05:17.202
They were doing target runs
on an old hulk.

05:17.411 --> 05:19.830
Who flies crates like these anymore?

05:20.080 --> 05:24.793
No one! These planes were reported
missing in 1945.

05:29.882 --> 05:31.550
But it looks brand-new!

05:35.971 --> 05:37.765
Where's the pilot?

05:38.599 --> 05:40.851
I don't understand!

05:41.644 --> 05:43.812
Where's the crew? Hey!

05:47.816 --> 05:50.653
How the hell did it get here?!

06:23.394 --> 06:24.853
He says this guy's local.

06:25.062 --> 06:27.690
He was here last night.
He saw it happen.

06:50.462 --> 06:52.047
Sunburn?

07:08.230 --> 07:11.108
He says the sun came out last night.

07:12.484 --> 07:14.862
He says it sang to him.

07:51.148 --> 07:53.359
Harry, keep an eye on that point-out.

07:53.609 --> 07:55.611
He's on 122.5.

07:55.819 --> 07:57.321
I'll be right back.

07:59.114 --> 08:02.618
Indianapolis Center, you have any
traffic for Air East 31?

08:04.620 --> 08:05.746
Air East 31, negative.

08:05.996 --> 08:10.918
The only traffic I have is a TWA L-1011
in your 6 o'clock position...

08:11.210 --> 08:13.420
...range 15 miles...

08:13.921 --> 08:17.633
...and an Allegheny DC-9 in
your 12 o'clock position, 50 miles.

08:17.841 --> 08:20.719
Stand by. I'll take a look at
broadband, over.

08:21.512 --> 08:24.556
Air East 31 has traffic 2 o'clock,
slightly above and descending.

08:25.391 --> 08:26.809
Air East 31, roger.

08:26.976 --> 08:30.020
I have a primary target
about that position now.

08:30.229 --> 08:31.981
I have no known traffic.

08:32.231 --> 08:34.316
Stand by, I'll check low, over.

08:35.067 --> 08:37.277
Check and see if they know who it is.

08:37.486 --> 08:38.861
Center, Air East 31.

08:39.071 --> 08:41.073
The traffic's not lower than us.

08:41.323 --> 08:44.743
He's 1 o'clock now,
still above me and descending.

08:45.536 --> 08:48.288
Air East 31,
can you say aircraft type?

08:49.164 --> 08:52.835
Negative, Center, no distinct outline.

08:54.253 --> 08:57.006
To tell you the truth,
the target is rather brilliant.

08:57.214 --> 09:01.176
It has the brightest anti-collision
lights I think I've ever seen.

09:01.385 --> 09:03.512
Alternating white to red.

09:03.971 --> 09:05.597
The colours are striking.

09:05.806 --> 09:09.059
Center, this is TWA 517.

09:09.310 --> 09:12.521
Traffic now looks lik e
extra-bright landing lights.

09:12.730 --> 09:15.858
I thought Air East
had his landing lights on.

09:17.151 --> 09:18.610
It could be a satellite.

09:18.861 --> 09:21.655
I have a primary target now
in your 10 o'clock position...

09:21.905 --> 09:22.990
...five miles, over.

09:23.157 --> 09:25.367
- Never seen anything like that.
- Affirmative, 31.

09:25.534 --> 09:28.996
The traffic is proceeding northeast.
No altitude readout.

09:29.204 --> 09:32.124
Roger, Center. It doesn't appear
he'll be a problem.

09:32.374 --> 09:35.711
He's going to descend
about 1500 feet below me.

09:35.919 --> 09:37.504
Wait a second!

09:37.755 --> 09:39.006
Stand by one.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.551
Okay, Center, Air East 31.
The traffic has turned.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.180
He's heading for my windshield.
We're turning immediately.

09:47.973 --> 09:50.267
Air East 31, descend
and maintain flight level 310.

09:50.476 --> 09:52.353
Break Allegheny,
turn right 30 degrees.

09:52.561 --> 09:57.191
Get on the horn to the 45th Recon Wing
and see what they're testing up there.

09:57.441 --> 10:01.320
Do you have test operations
in restricted area 2508?

10:01.528 --> 10:03.113
Air East 31, roger.

10:03.322 --> 10:07.409
The traffic is luminous and
exhibiting non-ballistic motion.

10:07.618 --> 10:10.329
Roger. Continue descent
at your discretion.

10:10.537 --> 10:13.624
Okay, Center. Descent
at pilot's discretion is approved.

10:13.832 --> 10:16.794
The traffic is approaching head-on,
ultra-bright and really moving.

10:17.002 --> 10:20.714
And right by us! Right now!
Now, that was really close.

10:20.923 --> 10:23.759
Air East 31 is out of 340...

10:23.968 --> 10:26.095
Ask if they want to report officially.

10:26.720 --> 10:30.265
TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO?
Over.

10:34.770 --> 10:38.607
TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO?
Over.

10:40.609 --> 10:43.654
Negative. We don't want to report.

10:43.862 --> 10:47.074
Air East 31,
do you wish to report a UFO? Over.

10:48.742 --> 10:51.537
Negative. We don't want
to report one either.

10:52.079 --> 10:55.833
Air East 31, do you wish to
file a report of any kind? Over.

10:56.583 --> 10:59.545
I wouldn't know what kind
of report to file, Center.

10:59.795 --> 11:01.797
Air East 31, me neither.

11:02.006 --> 11:04.466
I'll try to track traffic
to destination, over.

13:33.657 --> 13:36.035
- What are you doing?
- I'm just...

13:40.414 --> 13:42.291
What?

13:51.592 --> 13:52.926
Barry?

14:04.021 --> 14:05.314
Honey?

14:15.574 --> 14:17.242
Honey?

14:21.038 --> 14:22.623
Barry!

14:24.708 --> 14:26.794
Barry.

14:27.461 --> 14:28.962
Barry!

14:42.685 --> 14:45.688
Dad, do my problems for me.

14:47.106 --> 14:51.276
I don't have to do your problems for
you. You do your problems for you.

14:51.485 --> 14:55.072
That's why I graduated,
so I don't have to do problems.

14:55.572 --> 14:58.158
I don't understand these fractions.

14:58.367 --> 15:01.620
All right. What's one-third of 60?

15:02.329 --> 15:04.415
That's a fraction.
I don't understand them.

15:04.623 --> 15:06.000
All right, look.

15:06.333 --> 15:07.876
Let's say...

15:09.003 --> 15:12.464
...that this boxcar is 60 feet long.

15:13.465 --> 15:16.427
And one-third is across
this switch here.

15:16.593 --> 15:19.847
All right? Okay?

15:20.014 --> 15:24.018
And now another train is coming.

15:26.145 --> 15:29.148
How far do you have to move
this boxcar off the track...

15:29.356 --> 15:31.859
...so that the other train
doesn't smash it?

15:32.067 --> 15:34.737
Quickly, Brad, there are thousands
of lives at stake.

15:35.571 --> 15:37.364
Brad, any answer.

15:39.783 --> 15:41.869
Remember last weekend...

15:42.328 --> 15:45.831
...you promised everybody a movie
this weekend?

15:47.916 --> 15:49.168
Honey?

15:51.962 --> 15:55.841
- And you also promised Goofy Golf.
- Oh, yeah.

16:00.638 --> 16:04.308
Roy, what is all this stuff
on my table?

16:04.808 --> 16:07.186
I thought I told you
this was for my stuff.

16:07.394 --> 16:09.355
I mean, you can have that table.

16:09.563 --> 16:11.106
I don't want this on my table.

16:11.357 --> 16:13.484
This can cause tetanus!

16:13.901 --> 16:16.320
- What is this?!
- You know what's playing?

16:16.570 --> 16:19.406
Pinocchio!
The kids have never seen Pinocchio.

16:19.615 --> 16:22.242
You guys have never seen it.
You'll love it.

16:22.451 --> 16:23.702
I don't believe this.

16:23.911 --> 16:28.540
Who wants to go see
some dumb cartoon rated G for kids?

16:28.791 --> 16:30.668
- How old are you?
- Eight.

16:30.876 --> 16:32.586
- You wanna be 9?
- Yeah.

16:32.836 --> 16:35.464
Then you're gonna see Pinocchio
tomorrow night.

16:36.590 --> 16:38.926
That's a wonderful way
to win over your children.

16:39.093 --> 16:43.097
I'm not serious. I'm just saying
that I grew up with Pinocchio.

16:43.305 --> 16:46.225
And if kids are still kids,
they're gonna eat it up.

16:47.559 --> 16:48.686
Okay.

16:48.894 --> 16:51.313
Okay, I'm wrong.
I'm Wrong Roy, all right?

16:51.522 --> 16:55.359
Toby! You are close to death!
Come out here!

17:00.239 --> 17:05.202
Okay, now, I'll give you your choice.
I'm not gonna be biased in any way.

17:05.368 --> 17:09.540
You can either play Goofy Golf, which
means a lot of waiting and pushing...

17:09.748 --> 17:12.084
...or you can see Pinocchio...

17:12.334 --> 17:16.588
...which is a lot of furry animals and
magic and a wonderful time. Okay?

17:16.755 --> 17:18.507
- Now, let's vote.
- Golf!

17:18.715 --> 17:20.342
All right, everybody to bed!

17:20.592 --> 17:24.680
No way! Dad said we could finish
watching The Ten Commandments!

17:25.638 --> 17:28.267
Roy, that movie is four hours long.

17:28.474 --> 17:30.936
I told them
they'd watch only five commandments.

17:31.145 --> 17:32.688
- Hi, Ronnie, it's Earl.
- Hi, Earl.

17:32.855 --> 17:36.066
We got a big problem.
I need your old man in the field.

17:36.275 --> 17:38.277
Roy can't drive at night without me.

17:38.485 --> 17:40.654
We're experiencing an overall outage.

17:40.904 --> 17:43.824
Wait, wait, wait, I can't... Hey, honey.

17:44.533 --> 17:48.078
Jiminy Cricket!
It's Earl on the phone.

17:51.123 --> 17:52.583
Just a second.

17:52.750 --> 17:53.792
- Hello.
- Neary.

17:53.959 --> 17:57.379
Get into your truck
and report to line N in Tolono.

17:57.588 --> 18:01.592
We're losing power across the grid.
Has the outage hit you yet?

18:01.759 --> 18:06.263
Neary? Neary? Neary?

18:14.104 --> 18:15.147
Hey! Lights!

18:41.256 --> 18:43.717
Barry!

18:51.058 --> 18:53.394
Barry!

19:06.115 --> 19:08.158
Help! I'm lost.

19:10.869 --> 19:13.622
You're gonna cough up a little
Tolono, right?

19:14.123 --> 19:17.292
Cough up a Tolono
or an interstate, a Highway 90.

19:17.501 --> 19:19.837
A little familiar landmark
of some sort.

19:20.379 --> 19:23.090
- Cornbread Road, south of 20.
- Cornbread?

19:23.549 --> 19:25.217
Power must have been restored.

19:25.426 --> 19:28.637
Couple hundred neighbours think
it's Saturday night.

19:28.846 --> 19:29.930
Dispatch, this is 411.

19:30.180 --> 19:33.017
Do you want me to disregard
that Tolono call?

19:36.437 --> 19:38.480
You're in the middle of the road,
jackass!

19:39.106 --> 19:42.151
Can you tell me where Cornbread is?
Turkey!

20:10.304 --> 20:13.557
A-34... A-34... F-27.

20:14.850 --> 20:17.978
M-Mary-10 through M-Mary-12. Okay.

20:18.228 --> 20:21.065
Ten-47.

20:24.818 --> 20:25.903
All right.

20:26.070 --> 20:29.990
Stoppage in the single circuits
will lead you right to nowhere.

20:32.701 --> 20:34.286
M-Mary-10.

21:04.650 --> 21:09.196
Unit 211, 10-30, five, sev...

21:40.644 --> 21:42.354
Oh, shit.

23:32.131 --> 23:36.719
Unit 211, I'm back up on the street.
What do you guys got out there?

23:37.386 --> 23:39.221
I don't believe this!

23:39.930 --> 23:42.016
My God! It's bigger than a house!

23:44.018 --> 23:46.103
This thing is lik e a barn.

23:46.895 --> 23:49.315
This is absolutely crazy.

23:51.734 --> 23:53.527
What is your location?

23:53.694 --> 23:57.364
Just off the Telemark Expressway
and east toward Harper Valley.

25:04.056 --> 25:05.891
Barry.

25:06.976 --> 25:08.102
No!

25:08.477 --> 25:09.728
Watch out!

25:15.150 --> 25:17.903
Oh, my God! Lady! Lady!

25:18.112 --> 25:19.989
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

25:20.239 --> 25:23.701
I didn't see him.
He was in the middle of the road.

25:23.993 --> 25:25.995
- Hello?
- Oh, my God.

25:26.161 --> 25:29.540
- Hello! Here!
- What's the matter with you?

25:30.457 --> 25:34.545
Barry, come back here!
Come on, now.

26:04.658 --> 26:06.243
Ice cream!

26:26.221 --> 26:28.057
This is nuts.

26:29.224 --> 26:30.726
No.

27:11.266 --> 27:12.935
Wait a minute!

27:13.686 --> 27:16.105
What are you guys doing? Hey!

27:16.313 --> 27:19.024
That's Ohio! That's a quarter!

27:23.946 --> 27:27.866
Jesus, look at those suckers.
They're glued to the road!

28:15.414 --> 28:17.291
Honey, wake up!

28:18.000 --> 28:21.128
Ronnie, wake up!
You're not gonna believe what I saw!

28:21.378 --> 28:23.005
Don't! Not now.

28:23.213 --> 28:25.966
No, listen!
I never would have believed it!

28:26.175 --> 28:28.761
There was this...
In the cab there was this whole...

28:28.969 --> 28:31.430
It went... It was...
There was a red whoosh that...

28:33.474 --> 28:34.808
Roy.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.185
Ike called you.

28:36.977 --> 28:38.687
And McGovern.

28:38.896 --> 28:41.357
They want you to call.
They couldn't reach you.

28:41.899 --> 28:43.192
I turned the radio off.

28:43.442 --> 28:45.611
Don't do that.
The phone rang off the hook.

28:45.819 --> 28:49.448
It woke Sylvia up two times already.
You'd better call them.

28:49.657 --> 28:52.910
You know those pictures in National
Geographic, the aurora borealis?

28:53.118 --> 28:55.746
This is better than that. This is really...
Come on!

28:55.954 --> 28:57.915
Come on, Ronnie, get up. Come on.

28:58.123 --> 29:00.292
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I don't know.

29:00.501 --> 29:02.795
- Get up! I'm not kidding.
- Is it an accident?

29:02.962 --> 29:05.965
It's not an accident. You wanted
to get out of the house, right?

29:06.215 --> 29:07.800
Not at 4:00 in the morning.

29:08.050 --> 29:11.553
Ronnie, I need you
to see something with me.

29:11.762 --> 29:13.555
It's really important.

29:13.764 --> 29:16.350
Okay. All right.
What about the kids?

29:16.558 --> 29:18.310
What? Oh, the kids! I'll get the kids.

29:18.602 --> 29:20.562
Sylvia, we're going on an adventure.

29:20.980 --> 29:23.607
Toby! Brad! Come on! Get up.

29:23.816 --> 29:25.359
It's better than Goofy Golf!

29:29.738 --> 29:32.116
I'm going as fast as I can!

29:33.158 --> 29:34.243
Come on.

29:35.911 --> 29:39.415
All right, all right.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Harris.

29:39.665 --> 29:41.292
Roy, there's Mrs. Harris.

29:41.500 --> 29:45.045
There better be a good reason for this
because it doesn't make any sense.

29:46.463 --> 29:50.342
All right, Roy, I really think
you've proved your point.

29:50.592 --> 29:53.595
Roy. Roy.

29:53.762 --> 29:56.015
Roy, you're sunburned. Look at you.

30:02.104 --> 30:03.939
Honey, what is that?

30:08.944 --> 30:10.988
Roy, what did it look like?

30:11.989 --> 30:14.199
It was like an ice-cream cone.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.536
What flavour?

30:17.745 --> 30:19.038
Orange.

30:19.913 --> 30:22.458
It was orange.
It wasn't like an ice-cream cone.

30:22.791 --> 30:25.002
It was more like a shell.
You know, like this:

30:25.252 --> 30:26.629
Like a taco?

30:26.879 --> 30:31.508
Was it like one of those Sara Lee
moon-shaped cookies?

30:31.759 --> 30:34.303
Those crescent cookies?

30:42.936 --> 30:45.481
Don't you think I'm taking this
really well?

30:49.109 --> 30:53.072
I remember coming to places like this
just to look at each other.

30:57.618 --> 30:59.119
Snuggle.

33:24.974 --> 33:28.727
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

33:29.478 --> 33:30.896
I don't believe it.

33:31.105 --> 33:32.147
It's the Cotopaxi.

33:32.356 --> 33:35.442
- Why is it here?
- Beats the shit out of me.

34:10.101 --> 34:12.103
Is this the bathroom?

34:29.996 --> 34:33.375
Hey, this is not your toy to play with
every time I turn around.

34:33.626 --> 34:35.418
He looks like a 50l50 Bar.

34:35.628 --> 34:39.255
All right, out of this house.
All of you. Out of my house.

34:39.505 --> 34:41.842
I'm sorry, but you're
not to play with this!

34:42.051 --> 34:44.719
Get out while I clean up your mess!

34:45.012 --> 34:46.847
Thank you very much.

35:05.407 --> 35:07.618
Roy, I found
this overnight-tanning stuff.

35:07.826 --> 35:11.789
I want you to spray it on half
your face, so it's all one colour.

35:11.997 --> 35:15.042
It makes my face look yellow.
What does this remind you of?

35:15.876 --> 35:18.087
Then we'll tell everybody
you fell asleep...

35:18.337 --> 35:20.172
...under the sun lamp
on your right side.

35:20.506 --> 35:21.757
What for?

35:23.342 --> 35:25.803
- Dad, can I ask you a question?
- What?

35:25.970 --> 35:27.471
Are they for real?

35:27.680 --> 35:30.766
That's what for.
No, they are not for real.

35:31.016 --> 35:33.310
Go outside and have a hot dog, okay?

35:33.560 --> 35:35.145
Ronnie, don't tell him that.

35:35.646 --> 35:39.024
Roy, look, don't talk about this until
you know what you're talking about.

35:39.274 --> 35:43.278
If I can't talk about it,
how will I know what's going on?

35:43.529 --> 35:46.407
- What?
- Mom, I believe in them.

35:46.615 --> 35:49.994
- I believe in them too.
- Oh, no, you don't.

35:50.244 --> 35:51.870
Dad says we do.

35:52.121 --> 35:53.914
No, he does not.

35:54.707 --> 35:57.042
- Do you, Roy?
- Ronnie.

35:57.209 --> 36:00.713
All I wanna do is know
what's going on.

36:00.963 --> 36:04.091
Nothing's going on!
It's just one of those things.

36:04.341 --> 36:06.093
Which things? Which things?

36:06.802 --> 36:09.471
- I don't wanna hear about this.
- This is very important!

36:09.722 --> 36:12.558
I won't let it lay here.
I'm gonna call somebody!

36:12.766 --> 36:14.935
I'm not listening. I'm not listening.

36:15.144 --> 36:17.855
I saw something last night
that I can't explain.

36:19.815 --> 36:22.526
I saw something last night
I can't explain.

36:24.486 --> 36:26.780
I'm going out there again tonight.

36:28.949 --> 36:32.244
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

36:32.661 --> 36:35.539
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

36:38.083 --> 36:39.418
No, you're not.

36:39.627 --> 36:40.961
Do they live on the moon?

36:41.211 --> 36:45.424
They got bases there so at night
they can come through your window.

36:45.674 --> 36:48.761
This isn't a moonburn, goddamn it!

36:48.969 --> 36:51.889
- You came through my window.
- You hurt me!

36:52.097 --> 36:54.767
- You took all my covers.
- Roy's not like that.

36:54.975 --> 36:57.561
He loves his work. Don't say that!

36:57.770 --> 37:00.230
What did he do?
He was with us all night!

37:00.439 --> 37:01.940
I won't have to go tonight.

37:02.191 --> 37:04.902
He is not like that at all!

37:05.486 --> 37:07.488
Stop yelling at me!

37:07.946 --> 37:09.948
Can't you tell him about this?

37:10.157 --> 37:11.450
Hello?

37:11.867 --> 37:13.535
I can't believe it.

37:13.744 --> 37:15.037
Roy...

37:15.371 --> 37:17.039
...you got fired.

37:17.998 --> 37:20.084
They didn't even wanna talk to you.

38:34.575 --> 38:36.785
Where were the sounds coming from?

39:03.103 --> 39:06.523
Where did these sounds come from?
Tell us, please.

39:33.634 --> 39:36.095
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

39:40.474 --> 39:44.478
I beg your pardon,
but my English is not good too.

39:47.272 --> 39:48.899
I want to share with you now...

39:49.149 --> 39:52.444
...the breakthrough
that happened in India.

39:52.820 --> 39:55.864
We think it means something.

39:56.991 --> 39:59.827
We think it is important.

40:00.411 --> 40:05.374
To help you learn, I am using the hand
sign created by Zoltán Kodály.

40:06.500 --> 40:11.755
Kodály developed these signs
to teach music to deaf children.

41:36.924 --> 41:38.384
Hello?

41:39.218 --> 41:40.260
Hi.

41:40.469 --> 41:42.846
Hi, how are you? You came here too?

41:43.055 --> 41:44.598
Yes. Jillian Guiler.

41:44.807 --> 41:47.059
Roy Neary.
Sorry about what happened.

41:47.309 --> 41:50.312
- Good night!
- What?

41:52.022 --> 41:54.233
Look at you.

41:57.069 --> 41:59.363
You got the same burn.

41:59.613 --> 42:03.492
Yeah, but it's better on you.
You got it all over at least.

42:03.742 --> 42:06.203
I gotta tan the other side tonight.

42:06.787 --> 42:08.872
How's the kid? I'm really sorry.

42:09.081 --> 42:10.582
I'll be right back.

42:10.791 --> 42:13.836
Raise your head a bit
and give me a smile. Come on.

42:14.003 --> 42:17.172
He's a little young for a record,
don't you think?

42:37.067 --> 42:38.319
Weird.

42:40.154 --> 42:44.742
I know this sounds crazy, but
ever since yesterday on the road...

42:45.492 --> 42:47.411
...l've been seeing this shape.

42:49.747 --> 42:52.791
In shaving cream and pillows...

43:05.179 --> 43:09.266
Damn it, I know this!
I know what this is.

43:14.772 --> 43:16.565
This means something.

43:22.988 --> 43:24.823
This is important.

43:25.741 --> 43:28.577
- Here they come!
- Get the camera!

43:28.786 --> 43:32.164
- Out of the northwest!
- Jimmy, come here.

43:46.095 --> 43:48.931
It's like Halloween for grownups.

43:50.641 --> 43:52.101
Trick or treat.

44:23.173 --> 44:24.425
Wait a minute!

45:17.561 --> 45:18.604
Here are the patterns.

45:18.854 --> 45:22.316
- We received two 15-minute broadcasts.
- Non-random signals?

45:22.566 --> 45:26.278
104 rapid pulses. After a five-second
interval, 40 pulses.

45:26.528 --> 45:28.906
Another five-second break,
and 30 pulses.

45:30.783 --> 45:35.913
Silence, then a new set of numbers.
40, break five. 36, break five. Ten.

45:36.121 --> 45:38.290
- 104 rapid pulses.
- Lord!

45:38.540 --> 45:42.252
Wait 60 seconds and the
whole doggone thing repeats.

45:42.878 --> 45:45.631
- Where are the signals from?
- The neighbourhood.

45:45.839 --> 45:47.800
Light-travel time, roughly 7 seconds.

45:48.050 --> 45:50.177
Well within the plane
of the ecliptic.

45:50.427 --> 45:55.265
Are these non-random signals here,
40, 36, 10, in response to that?

45:55.516 --> 45:58.894
No. They should be. We've sent
this combination out for weeks.

45:59.061 --> 46:01.105
But all we're getting back
are numbers.

46:06.652 --> 46:10.364
This could mean the India sounds
reached a dead end.

46:10.698 --> 46:11.991
They don't mean a thing.

46:12.199 --> 46:14.243
There's so much we don't know.

46:14.451 --> 46:17.079
How about where the signals originate?

46:20.082 --> 46:21.458
Excuse me.

46:23.752 --> 46:25.754
What letter is 104?

46:28.173 --> 46:29.508
Excuse me.

46:32.720 --> 46:35.806
Before I got paid to speak French...

46:38.934 --> 46:40.519
...I used to read maps.

46:42.688 --> 46:44.982
This first number is a longitude.

46:48.902 --> 46:52.072
I've got two sets of three numbers.

46:52.281 --> 46:55.242
Degrees, minutes and seconds.

46:55.451 --> 46:59.663
The first number has three digits,
and the last two are below 60.

47:00.623 --> 47:03.834
It's not in the right ascension
and declination on the sky.

47:05.210 --> 47:07.588
These have to be Earth coordinates.

47:07.796 --> 47:09.798
There's a globe in the office.

47:13.302 --> 47:14.637
This is what we need.

47:14.845 --> 47:17.348
Maybe there's a release pin
underneath here.

47:17.765 --> 47:20.059
That's a $2500 globe!
What are you doing?

47:20.225 --> 47:23.020
- It's heavy, watch your feet.
- Let me hit the mother.

47:38.285 --> 47:42.122
All right, everybody, quiet down!
Hold it down! Quiet!

47:45.334 --> 47:46.710
That's not right.

47:46.877 --> 47:49.213
The antenna. How dumb!

47:49.421 --> 47:51.173
- Which way's it pointing?
- Northeast.

47:51.382 --> 47:52.883
That's Wyoming.

47:59.723 --> 48:02.184
We'll need a geodetic survey map
of Wyoming.

48:02.434 --> 48:04.269
I want it to the square yard.

48:04.520 --> 48:07.606
The Army has a geodetic
survey map of Wyoming.

48:07.773 --> 48:09.858
We not only need...

49:59.426 --> 50:01.053
Toys!

50:02.179 --> 50:04.098
Toys!

51:21.300 --> 51:22.801
Oh, my God!

51:51.580 --> 51:53.916
You can come and play now.

51:54.166 --> 51:55.960
You can come and play now.

52:01.256 --> 52:03.926
Come in through the door.

52:05.803 --> 52:09.139
One, two, three...

52:17.898 --> 52:19.274
Oh, honey.

52:19.483 --> 52:21.610
Mom, look! The sun's here!

52:24.697 --> 52:26.824
Oh, honey.

52:27.491 --> 52:29.326
Oh, my God!

53:07.364 --> 53:08.949
Go away!

53:33.182 --> 53:34.600
Clean everything up!

53:50.866 --> 53:52.993
- Mom, let me listen!
- Wait a minute! Wait.

54:10.636 --> 54:12.179
- Mom, look!
- Oh, my God.

54:20.854 --> 54:23.273
Come in through the door.

54:45.170 --> 54:49.341
Barry! Barry!

54:59.310 --> 55:00.686
Jillian. Jillian.

55:03.731 --> 55:04.982
May we have a statement?

55:05.190 --> 55:08.068
The report you gave to the police
was spectacular.

55:08.319 --> 55:10.404
We need it for the 6:00 news.

55:13.073 --> 55:14.366
They got him.

55:14.533 --> 55:15.576
What?

55:15.784 --> 55:18.370
Is it true you're leaving
to look for your son?

55:18.621 --> 55:21.832
- Has there been a ransom note?
- Where will you start looking?

55:24.501 --> 55:26.337
His name is Barry.

55:27.212 --> 55:29.298
Where is your husband now,
Mrs. Guiler?

55:30.799 --> 55:34.345
Are you involved in any
kind of parapsychologies?

55:35.346 --> 55:37.389
Turn around, please. Turn around!

55:39.600 --> 55:42.853
You gave the police a report.
Would you mind repeating it?

55:46.857 --> 55:49.985
Folks, you can go in now. Room 3655.

55:50.444 --> 55:53.781
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a flying saucer.

55:53.989 --> 55:55.115
That's the one I saw!

55:58.035 --> 56:01.288
I swear that's the same one!
It's the one I saw!

56:02.623 --> 56:05.209
It's made of pewter, made in Japan...

56:05.417 --> 56:08.504
...and thrown across the lawn
by one of my children.

56:10.255 --> 56:14.551
I wanted to point out that we're
not all "polished brass" about this.

56:14.760 --> 56:17.680
And also point out that last year...

56:17.888 --> 56:20.891
...Americans shot more than seven
billion photographs...

56:21.100 --> 56:26.146
...at a record of $6.6 billion
for film equipment and processing.

56:26.313 --> 56:28.232
Now, with all those
shutters clicking...

56:28.399 --> 56:31.193
...where is the indisputable
photographic evidence?

56:31.402 --> 56:34.780
I've been in the news
business for a long time.

56:35.030 --> 56:38.909
We never took a picture
of a plane crash as it happened...

56:39.159 --> 56:42.746
...or an automobile accident
and get it on the 6:00 news.

56:50.879 --> 56:54.258
There are lots of ideas
that would be fun to believe in.

56:54.633 --> 56:56.302
Mental telepathy...

56:56.552 --> 56:58.053
...time travel...

56:58.429 --> 57:00.097
...immortality...

57:00.723 --> 57:02.599
...even Santa Claus.

57:03.225 --> 57:07.396
I know it's no fun to go home and
say, "Guess what happened today?

57:07.604 --> 57:11.317
I was in the shopping centre,
and there was this bright light...

57:11.567 --> 57:13.777
...and I rushed outside...

57:13.986 --> 57:15.988
...and it was an aeroplane."

57:16.280 --> 57:19.199
Excuse me, sir.
I didn't want to see this.

57:20.534 --> 57:21.827
I sure wish I had.

57:22.077 --> 57:23.996
For 15 years I've been looking...

57:24.246 --> 57:27.249
...for these damn silly lights
in the night sky.

57:27.750 --> 57:29.126
I've never found any.

57:29.376 --> 57:32.254
I'd like to, because
I believe in life elsewhere.

57:32.713 --> 57:34.006
Why don't you admit...

57:34.214 --> 57:37.968
...that the Air Force is conducting
tests in the Foothills area?

57:38.177 --> 57:40.846
It would be easy to say yes to that.

57:41.555 --> 57:45.225
But I'm not going to mislead you.
This is not the case.

57:45.809 --> 57:47.811
I don't know what you saw.

57:48.062 --> 57:50.439
You can't fool us by agreeing with us.

57:50.648 --> 57:52.107
No, come on!

57:52.441 --> 57:54.360
I saw Bigfoot once.

57:59.198 --> 58:03.369
1951. Back in Sequoia National Park.

58:03.577 --> 58:07.831
Had a foot on her, 37 inches.
Heel to toe.

58:11.752 --> 58:15.255
Made a sound I would not want
to hear twice in my life.

58:20.177 --> 58:23.013
I believe I've encountered
that gentleman myself.

58:24.139 --> 58:26.767
I was sitting on the porch,
looking through the screen.

58:26.976 --> 58:29.353
I seen this big white dot in the sky.

58:29.561 --> 58:31.855
It turned red and blue and green.

58:36.610 --> 58:41.573
UFOs do not represent a direct
physical threat to national security.

58:42.700 --> 58:46.328
We do not support them,
and we encourage you not to.

59:24.992 --> 59:27.161
Let's get in touch with
the forest service...

59:27.369 --> 59:31.081
...or we'll end up in a wilderness
area with vehicular traffic.

59:31.457 --> 59:35.252
And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff
for those folks in Wyoming.

59:41.675 --> 59:44.219
If this mission fully develops...

59:45.220 --> 59:50.142
...I get white knuckles thinking about
what might be ahead for those folks.

59:51.268 --> 59:53.103
Your flight will be at 2000 hours.

59:53.312 --> 59:56.982
We have a limo that'll take you
to the heliport now.

59:57.524 --> 01:00:01.070
And transportation will be provided
on the other end.

01:00:03.572 --> 01:00:06.200
- I like the flash-flood idea.
- Where do you get the water?

01:00:06.367 --> 01:00:08.035
We've had about two inches of rain...

01:00:08.202 --> 01:00:11.830
We'll tell them one of the reservoirs
is gonna burst.

01:00:11.997 --> 01:00:14.625
Besides, there's not enough water
in those reservoirs!

01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:18.170
Wait! Contaminated water
affects people, crops, animals.

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.588
Disease.

01:00:19.797 --> 01:00:22.466
- Yeah, epidemic.
- What kind of disease?

01:00:22.716 --> 01:00:23.759
A plague epidemic.

01:00:23.968 --> 01:00:26.095
Nobody will believe a plague.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.681
- Anthrax.
- Ranching country.

01:00:28.889 --> 01:00:31.225
There are a lot of sheep in the hills.

01:00:31.433 --> 01:00:32.685
Good, I like that.

01:00:32.893 --> 01:00:35.938
- It'll create a panic.
- But it may not evacuate everybody.

01:00:36.188 --> 01:00:39.108
There's always some joker
who thinks he's immune.

01:00:41.151 --> 01:00:45.322
I need something so scary
it'll clear 300 square miles...

01:00:45.531 --> 01:00:48.409
...of every living Christian soul.

01:01:19.648 --> 01:01:21.358
Help yourself.

01:01:24.403 --> 01:01:28.907
I hate these potatoes.
There's a dead fly in my potatoes.

01:01:29.116 --> 01:01:30.409
It's okay.

01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:18.809
Well, I guess you've noticed...

01:03:19.601 --> 01:03:24.106
...something is a little strange
with Dad.

01:03:27.318 --> 01:03:29.069
It's okay, though.

01:03:31.363 --> 01:03:33.032
I'm still Dad.

01:03:38.078 --> 01:03:42.124
I can't describe it,
what I'm feeling...

01:03:42.374 --> 01:03:44.710
...and what I'm thinking.

01:03:47.338 --> 01:03:49.548
This means something.

01:03:50.799 --> 01:03:53.093
This is important.

01:04:04.229 --> 01:04:06.023
That's not right.

01:04:09.818 --> 01:04:11.320
It's not right.

01:04:13.447 --> 01:04:15.240
That's not right.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.354
What is it?

01:04:46.897 --> 01:04:49.233
What is it?!

01:04:56.615 --> 01:04:58.367
It's not fair.

01:05:03.872 --> 01:05:05.374
Tell me.

01:05:30.149 --> 01:05:34.236
Roy? Roy.

01:05:35.154 --> 01:05:36.947
Open the door, please.

01:05:38.032 --> 01:05:42.244
Please. Roy. Roy!

01:05:42.411 --> 01:05:44.079
Open this door!

01:05:44.330 --> 01:05:46.248
Open this door!

01:05:51.879 --> 01:05:53.380
All right.

01:06:14.693 --> 01:06:17.613
I don't think I know
what's happening to me.

01:06:23.619 --> 01:06:28.248
Look, Roy. What it is,
is family therapy.

01:06:28.457 --> 01:06:31.168
I mean, we all go. We all talk.

01:06:31.418 --> 01:06:35.381
No one is singled out.
Maybe it's not your fault anyway.

01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:40.302
- It's waterproof. It still works.
- Roy! Promise me you'll go!

01:06:40.844 --> 01:06:43.889
You crybaby! You crybaby!

01:06:44.139 --> 01:06:45.975
- You crybaby!
- Get out of here!

01:06:46.225 --> 01:06:47.393
Get out!

01:06:47.601 --> 01:06:50.020
Come on, you guys. Come on.

01:06:50.187 --> 01:06:51.939
You crybaby!

01:06:52.189 --> 01:06:53.732
- Be quiet!
- Stop it!

01:06:53.983 --> 01:06:55.567
I don't understand it!

01:06:55.818 --> 01:06:58.279
- Neither do I.
- Get out!

01:06:58.529 --> 01:07:01.448
Go to your room and close the door.

01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:05.494
- Ronnie?
- Yes.

01:07:05.744 --> 01:07:09.915
I'm really scared.
I want you to help me.

01:07:10.207 --> 01:07:13.252
All this bullshit!
It's turning this house upside down!

01:07:13.419 --> 01:07:15.838
- Ronnie, just...
- I just hate you! That's why!

01:07:16.088 --> 01:07:17.798
- No!
- Ronnie. Ronnie.

01:07:17.965 --> 01:07:21.302
Hold me. Put your arms
around me. It'll really help me.

01:07:21.552 --> 01:07:22.720
It'll really help me.

01:07:22.928 --> 01:07:25.681
Listen! Listen!
Don't you see what's happening?

01:07:26.223 --> 01:07:28.225
None of our friends call us anymore!

01:07:28.434 --> 01:07:30.644
You're out of work! You don't care!

01:07:30.853 --> 01:07:33.480
You're wrecking us!
You're ruining us!

01:07:33.939 --> 01:07:36.442
- Ronnie, just hold on.
- No! No!

01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:37.901
- Hold on.
- No!

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.739
Ronnie.

01:07:42.323 --> 01:07:44.241
Ronnie?

01:07:45.492 --> 01:07:48.537
Ronnie, open the door now.
Come on.

01:08:23.863 --> 01:08:26.908
Well, what do you know?
It's disintegrated.

01:08:30.037 --> 01:08:33.916
Happy birthday, you thing from
another world, you.

01:08:34.457 --> 01:08:36.042
Thank you!

01:08:43.091 --> 01:08:45.051
Well, I guess he's had enough.

01:08:47.513 --> 01:08:49.848
Are you going to yell at me?

01:09:05.531 --> 01:09:08.450
Ronnie? Everything's fine.

01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:20.754
All this stuff is coming down.

01:09:25.718 --> 01:09:28.470
It's all gonna be like it was.

01:09:36.645 --> 01:09:41.734
That's the last straw!
Now I use my secret weapon!

01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:12.765
Roy?

01:10:12.931 --> 01:10:16.644
Roy, I'm sorry about last night. Roy!

01:10:19.688 --> 01:10:21.941
Roy, what are you doing?

01:10:22.942 --> 01:10:24.443
Jesus!

01:10:33.786 --> 01:10:35.079
The plants are fine there!

01:10:36.497 --> 01:10:37.706
Can you hear me?

01:10:38.374 --> 01:10:39.541
Wait!

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:41.752
Wait! What are you doing?

01:10:41.961 --> 01:10:43.128
You're gonna love it!

01:10:43.337 --> 01:10:45.756
- What do you mean?
- You'll really love this.

01:10:45.965 --> 01:10:48.676
Roy, what are you doing?

01:10:54.139 --> 01:10:55.849
Oh, Roy!

01:10:56.642 --> 01:10:57.685
My God!

01:10:59.353 --> 01:11:00.813
Come on, men!

01:11:02.314 --> 01:11:06.527
Dad, after this, can we
throw dirt in my window?

01:11:10.114 --> 01:11:11.448
Stop it.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.410
Stop. Stop it.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.078
Honey!

01:11:16.704 --> 01:11:21.041
If I don't do this, that's when
I'm gonna need a doctor.

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:25.713
What are you doing?

01:11:25.963 --> 01:11:27.631
- I got it.
- What are you doing?

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.302
I figured it out, that's all.
Will you just listen?

01:11:31.552 --> 01:11:36.473
You ever look at something crazy, and
then see it another way and it's not?

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.683
No, I haven't.

01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:39.935
Come on, Ronnie. Just listen.

01:11:40.144 --> 01:11:42.521
- I don't know what you're doing.
- Close your eyes.

01:11:42.688 --> 01:11:46.108
Close your eyes and hold your breath,
everything will be really pretty.

01:11:47.318 --> 01:11:48.360
You're scaring us now.

01:11:48.569 --> 01:11:51.655
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.
I feel really good.

01:11:51.905 --> 01:11:53.657
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:11:53.866 --> 01:11:55.993
I haven't felt this good in years.

01:11:56.243 --> 01:11:58.412
Everything's gonna be okay.
I can feel it.

01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:04.627
- Now what else? What else?
- Like this? Like this?

01:12:05.919 --> 01:12:07.171
Right.

01:12:46.168 --> 01:12:47.461
Like this?

01:12:50.339 --> 01:12:51.715
Chicken wire.

01:13:02.184 --> 01:13:04.269
Whatever you're doing,
it's against the law!

01:13:04.436 --> 01:13:06.105
He's putting it back, Mrs. Harris.

01:13:06.313 --> 01:13:07.398
I'll pay you for this.

01:13:07.564 --> 01:13:08.607
Take it. Take it.

01:13:08.816 --> 01:13:10.609
I'm perfectly fine.

01:13:10.859 --> 01:13:12.945
Let go of this fence.
Come with me.

01:13:13.153 --> 01:13:16.031
Do you want me to hit you?
Let go of that fence!

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.617
Toby! Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:13:18.826 --> 01:13:20.536
Come on, right now.
We're going.

01:13:20.786 --> 01:13:23.914
- I want to stay here!
- Let go of the fence! Come on.

01:13:42.182 --> 01:13:44.351
Stay! Stay!

01:13:48.314 --> 01:13:50.733
- Where we going?
- Where we going?

01:13:50.941 --> 01:13:52.651
- Where are we going?
- Get in the car.

01:13:52.818 --> 01:13:55.779
- Where are we going?
- Quietly, quickly, get in.

01:13:56.196 --> 01:13:57.406
Get in there, Toby.

01:13:57.865 --> 01:13:58.907
Quickly.

01:14:02.036 --> 01:14:04.496
- Dad needs some more help!
- Lock the doors!

01:14:04.705 --> 01:14:06.040
Dad needs some more help!

01:14:06.248 --> 01:14:09.752
Quiet! Just lock the doors.
Roll up those windows.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.463
Dad needs some more help!

01:14:12.713 --> 01:14:14.298
Honey, where you going?

01:14:14.506 --> 01:14:16.425
- What?
- Where are you going?

01:14:17.259 --> 01:14:19.637
Taking the kids to my sister's.

01:14:21.096 --> 01:14:23.307
That's crazy.
You're not even dressed.

01:14:24.433 --> 01:14:25.517
What?

01:14:25.893 --> 01:14:27.269
You said what?

01:14:32.274 --> 01:14:33.943
Ronnie, wait!

01:14:34.193 --> 01:14:36.195
Ronnie, hold it.

01:14:37.696 --> 01:14:39.114
Would you hold it one minute?

01:15:06.392 --> 01:15:07.434
Morning.

01:15:46.974 --> 01:15:50.144
What is wrong with me today?

01:15:56.233 --> 01:15:57.484
Who is it, please?

01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:02.114
It's the mailman. There's a package
for Julie Anderson.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.245
You can just leave it at the door!

01:16:09.913 --> 01:16:14.251
I can't do that.
I'm supposed to C. O.D. Lik e that.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:15.794
And besides...

01:16:16.754 --> 01:16:19.214
...you and I have to have
a little talk...

01:16:20.215 --> 01:16:21.800
...about Kim.

01:16:41.362 --> 01:16:44.239
Lik e sands through the hourglass...

01:16:44.490 --> 01:16:47.451
...so are the Days of Our Lives.

01:17:13.185 --> 01:17:16.981
Good evening. At the top of the news
tonight, a rail disaster.

01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:19.066
At Devil's Tower, Wyoming...

01:17:19.275 --> 01:17:22.736
...a trainload of dangerous
chemical gas went off the rails...

01:17:22.945 --> 01:17:25.572
...and forced the widest
area evacuation...

01:17:25.781 --> 01:17:29.034
...in the history of these
controversial Army rail shipments.

01:17:29.243 --> 01:17:32.579
Whenever you want me to.
Tomorrow is fine.

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.667
I can do other things.

01:17:37.376 --> 01:17:39.628
I'm trying to be.

01:17:40.963 --> 01:17:42.006
Yes, I am.

01:17:42.214 --> 01:17:45.175
The Army and National Guard are
supervising the evacuation.

01:17:45.592 --> 01:17:50.055
I am an adult, okay?
Even though there's no such thing.

01:17:50.264 --> 01:17:51.890
It was a joke!

01:17:52.099 --> 01:17:54.852
- The danger will be over
within 72 hours.

01:17:55.519 --> 01:17:58.314
Ronnie, anything you want.

01:17:58.647 --> 01:18:01.275
Anything you want, I'll do.

01:18:04.236 --> 01:18:05.738
For how long?

01:18:11.744 --> 01:18:13.370
All of you?

01:18:14.705 --> 01:18:19.251
No. Ronnie, I wanna talk
about this in person.

01:18:20.336 --> 01:18:23.881
This is not... We can't talk
about this on the telephone.

01:18:25.299 --> 01:18:27.926
Ronnie! Don't hang up!
Just don't...

01:18:28.093 --> 01:18:34.224
- meat should remain unaffected.
This means order your steak well-done.

01:18:34.391 --> 01:18:37.561
Devil's Tower, Wyoming was
the first national monument...

01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:41.523
...erected in this country by
Theodore Roosevelt in 1915.

01:18:41.774 --> 01:18:45.277
Thousands of civilian refugees
are fleeing the area...

01:18:45.486 --> 01:18:48.906
...spurred by rumours that the
overturned tank er cars...

01:18:49.156 --> 01:18:53.661
...at Walkashi Needles Junction were
filled to capacity with nerve gas.

01:18:53.827 --> 01:18:55.496
In a few minutes,
we're going to be...

01:18:55.704 --> 01:18:59.249
- boasts 400, 000 vacationers.

01:18:59.416 --> 01:19:02.127
Fortunately, during this mishap
there have been no fatalities.

01:19:02.336 --> 01:19:04.880
- Evacuate this area,
which soon...

01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:08.801
...will become the "hot zone,"
depending on the prevailing winds.

01:19:09.051 --> 01:19:12.805
This is as close to the disaster
as we've been allowed to get.

01:19:13.055 --> 01:19:15.724
- Due to a strong prevailing
north-south wind.

01:19:15.933 --> 01:19:18.727
Army engineers and the
Wyoming National Guard...

01:19:18.936 --> 01:19:22.439
...are making every effort to
contain the leaking toxins...

01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:25.818
...and evacuate an area of almost
200 square miles.

01:19:26.026 --> 01:19:29.405
Everyone is being warned:
Stay out of the area.

01:19:29.655 --> 01:19:32.658
Everyone, please,
stay out of the area.

01:19:32.741 --> 01:19:34.910
- And thousands of others
are homeless.

01:19:35.119 --> 01:19:39.540
U.S. Army Materiel Command has
issued these new area restrictions:

01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:42.167
All roadways north of Crowheart on
Interstate 25.

01:19:42.334 --> 01:19:43.377
Shit.

01:19:43.544 --> 01:19:46.755
All roads leading into the
Grand Tetons west of Meteste.

01:19:46.964 --> 01:19:49.883
All multilane undivided
full-traffic interchange...

01:19:50.092 --> 01:19:54.054
...railroad, local and historic
stage roads south of Cody.

01:20:04.356 --> 01:20:07.234
Why aren't there fat lines
instead of these thin ones?

01:20:08.819 --> 01:20:10.362
Yo!

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:14.116
- Holy mother of...
- You're going the wrong way!

01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:18.996
Yo! Turn back around. Back this way.

01:20:19.622 --> 01:20:21.165
What's the matter with you?

01:20:21.457 --> 01:20:23.000
Yes, sir. Sorry, officer.

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:26.086
It's just a rental, officer.
Just a rental.

01:20:26.879 --> 01:20:28.213
My fault! My fault!

01:20:28.464 --> 01:20:30.758
Starting with the letter "F,"
as in "Frank"...

01:20:31.008 --> 01:20:33.177
...to the letter "J" as in "Jack"...

01:20:33.385 --> 01:20:37.765
...please find your way to the loading
platform for immediate boarding.

01:20:41.393 --> 01:20:43.729
You'll be real disappointed
and sorry...

01:20:43.938 --> 01:20:48.442
...if you don't have an early-warning
system, such as a bird, a gas mask.

01:20:48.651 --> 01:20:50.778
Why, even my dog has a gas mask.

01:20:50.986 --> 01:20:53.656
And any of you folks are
worth more than a dog.

01:20:56.408 --> 01:21:00.037
Roy? Roy!

01:21:01.664 --> 01:21:03.666
Roy!

01:21:16.845 --> 01:21:18.097
Roy?

01:21:21.225 --> 01:21:22.977
Roy?

01:21:25.354 --> 01:21:26.897
Roy!

01:21:28.107 --> 01:21:30.025
Roy.

01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:34.071
Roy!

01:21:38.701 --> 01:21:41.704
I don't care where you go,
just get behind the barricade!

01:21:42.871 --> 01:21:45.082
There's no way out!

01:22:08.564 --> 01:22:09.607
What are we doing?

01:22:09.815 --> 01:22:13.193
Only way to get back is cross-country.
We'll break through the fence.

01:22:13.402 --> 01:22:15.237
- Let's go.
- All right, hold on. Hold on.

01:22:39.345 --> 01:22:41.680
The police dragged the river for him.

01:22:41.889 --> 01:22:44.808
I told them he wasn't in the river.
He wasn't.

01:22:45.059 --> 01:22:49.730
Then they went around to every house
within five miles...

01:22:50.731 --> 01:22:54.818
...looking inside
back-yard refrigerators.

01:22:58.864 --> 01:23:02.242
They asked if I'd seen any strangers
in the neighbourhood.

01:24:10.394 --> 01:24:12.605
I don't believe it's real.

01:24:14.732 --> 01:24:16.775
I don't believe it's real.

01:24:18.027 --> 01:24:19.486
It's real.

01:24:26.076 --> 01:24:29.330
Let's get down there. Get some gas
and get down in there.

01:24:32.541 --> 01:24:33.584
What are those?

01:24:58.025 --> 01:25:02.196
Look, I guarantee you.
This whole thing is a put-on.

01:25:49.118 --> 01:25:51.412
What do you want?
Get your hands off!

01:25:53.706 --> 01:25:56.125
- How are you feeling?
- I feel fine!

01:25:56.834 --> 01:26:00.170
According to my birds, the only bad air
is from you guys farting around!

01:26:11.307 --> 01:26:13.225
- Move them out!
- What's happening?

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:15.728
- What? Where are we going?
- Go to the van.

01:26:15.894 --> 01:26:17.271
Where are you taking her?

01:26:17.479 --> 01:26:19.565
Hold it! Why can't we go together?

01:26:19.732 --> 01:26:20.774
Watch your step.

01:26:21.275 --> 01:26:22.818
Roy.

01:26:39.084 --> 01:26:42.087
We have very little time, Mr. Neary.
This is Mr. Lacombe.

01:26:42.254 --> 01:26:44.506
- Hello.
- We need answers from you...

01:26:44.673 --> 01:26:46.800
...that are honest, direct
and to the point.

01:26:47.009 --> 01:26:48.135
Where is Jillian?

01:26:50.429 --> 01:26:53.557
Do you realise the danger you
and your friend have risked?

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.895
In coming here, you've
exposed yourself to toxic gas.

01:26:58.103 --> 01:26:59.688
Well, I'm alive.

01:26:59.897 --> 01:27:01.273
We're talking.

01:27:02.274 --> 01:27:04.318
This is true, Mr. Neary.

01:27:05.235 --> 01:27:08.614
But if the wind blew from
the south instead of the north...

01:27:10.032 --> 01:27:12.242
...this conversation would not be
taking place.

01:27:12.451 --> 01:27:14.328
There's nothing wrong with the air.

01:27:15.829 --> 01:27:17.414
What makes you say that?

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:19.917
I just know.
There's nothing wrong with it.

01:27:20.459 --> 01:27:22.670
Go outside and make me a liar.

01:27:26.882 --> 01:27:29.301
I wanna talk to the man in charge.

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:31.887
Mr. Lacombe is the highest authority.

01:27:32.262 --> 01:27:34.098
He isn't even an American.

01:27:36.475 --> 01:27:39.436
Mr. Neary, are you an artist
or a painter?

01:27:40.604 --> 01:27:41.647
No.

01:27:45.276 --> 01:27:48.362
Have you been hearing a persistent
ringing in your ears?

01:27:48.570 --> 01:27:50.406
Almost an agreeable ringing?

01:27:50.614 --> 01:27:51.657
No.

01:27:53.075 --> 01:27:55.244
Having headaches, migraines?

01:27:55.744 --> 01:27:56.829
Yeah.

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:00.124
An irritation in your eyes
and your sinuses?

01:28:00.374 --> 01:28:01.500
Yeah.

01:28:02.626 --> 01:28:05.838
Do you have hives?
Do you have allergies?

01:28:07.923 --> 01:28:10.175
And burning on your face
and on your body?

01:28:10.384 --> 01:28:12.970
- Yes. Who are you people?
- Look at this.

01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:16.223
I got one like it in my living room.
Who are you people?

01:28:22.104 --> 01:28:24.607
Monsieur Neary, please,
one more question.

01:28:26.358 --> 01:28:28.944
Have you recently had
a close encounter?

01:28:30.112 --> 01:28:33.198
A close encounter
with something very unusual?

01:28:36.118 --> 01:28:38.245
Who are you people?

01:28:44.793 --> 01:28:48.756
- These people strangers to you?
- Yeah. Except for her.

01:28:50.966 --> 01:28:53.802
And the two of you felt compelled
to be here?

01:28:54.928 --> 01:28:56.805
Yeah, you might say that.

01:28:57.306 --> 01:29:00.559
- But what did you expect to find?
- An answer.

01:29:02.186 --> 01:29:04.104
That's not crazy, is it?

01:29:20.371 --> 01:29:23.374
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:24.792
Is that it?

01:29:25.793 --> 01:29:28.212
Is that all you're gonna ask me?

01:29:29.129 --> 01:29:31.632
Well, I got a couple of thousand
goddamn questions.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:36.053
I wanna speak to someone in charge.
I wanna lodge a complaint.

01:29:36.428 --> 01:29:38.722
You have no right
to make people crazy.

01:29:38.931 --> 01:29:43.143
You think I investigate every
Walter Cronkite story there is?

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:47.231
If this is just nerve gas, how come I
know everything in such detail?

01:29:47.439 --> 01:29:49.191
I've never been here before.

01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:52.069
How come I know so much?

01:29:52.361 --> 01:29:54.280
What the hell is going on
around here?!

01:29:54.488 --> 01:29:56.532
Who the hell are you people?!

01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:23.475
Is that it?! Answer me!

01:30:24.184 --> 01:30:27.605
I didn't come this far to get
taken on any bus ride home!

01:30:50.210 --> 01:30:52.296
Five minutes. Five!

01:30:52.963 --> 01:30:55.174
We're gonna hold
for a couple of minutes.

01:31:29.124 --> 01:31:32.461
You brought 12 people to
the decontamination camp...

01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:37.091
...instead of the evacuation centre
where they belong. Why?

01:31:37.299 --> 01:31:40.135
- Because this means something.
- This means something.

01:31:42.012 --> 01:31:45.266
These people have come from
all over their country...

01:31:47.017 --> 01:31:50.437
...to a place they've been told
will endanger their lives.

01:31:50.646 --> 01:31:51.772
Why?

01:31:52.022 --> 01:31:55.734
Because somebody could be trying
to subvert this whole operation...

01:31:55.985 --> 01:31:59.446
...by sending in fanatics, cultists
and Christ knows what all.

01:32:00.239 --> 01:32:01.782
Yes.

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:04.868
Thank you very much.

01:32:07.037 --> 01:32:09.498
This is a small group of people...

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:14.211
...who have shared a vision in common.

01:32:14.837 --> 01:32:16.005
Look.

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:22.219
It's still a mystery to me
why they are here.

01:32:22.469 --> 01:32:24.471
Even they do not know why.

01:32:43.115 --> 01:32:44.867
Jillian!

01:32:45.951 --> 01:32:47.911
- Jillian.
- Don't! You'll be poisoned!

01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:51.582
Listen, there's nothing wrong
with the air around here.

01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:55.794
The Army's getting us out because
they don't want any witnesses.

01:32:56.462 --> 01:32:59.798
If the Army doesn't want us here,
it's none of our business.

01:33:00.049 --> 01:33:03.594
We wanted to see the mountain.
It was a coincidence when I painted it.

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:05.429
You can take it off!

01:33:05.638 --> 01:33:08.432
The air here is better
than in Los Angeles.

01:33:09.391 --> 01:33:13.187
Listen. How many of you people are
for getting out of here?

01:33:18.734 --> 01:33:22.237
I don't know what's happening either.
I must find out what's going on.

01:33:26.992 --> 01:33:31.705
For every one of these anxious,
anguished people who've come here...

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:38.963
...there must be hundreds more touched
by the vision who never made it here.

01:33:39.964 --> 01:33:42.883
Simply because they never watch
the television.

01:33:44.551 --> 01:33:47.846
Or perhaps they watched it, but never
made the psychic connection.

01:33:48.097 --> 01:33:51.892
It's a coincidence. It's not scientific.

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:56.313
Listen to me, Major Walsh...

01:33:56.522 --> 01:33:59.066
...it is an event sociological.

01:34:17.918 --> 01:34:20.129
Hey! Wait a minute!

01:34:36.103 --> 01:34:38.188
- My name's Neary!
- Larry Butler!

01:34:38.397 --> 01:34:40.065
- How are you?
- Okay! You?

01:34:40.316 --> 01:34:42.109
- Fine, fine!
- That's good!

01:34:42.735 --> 01:34:47.197
Everybody keep their masks on until
you're out of here and out of danger.

01:34:47.406 --> 01:34:51.619
Listen, we wanna get out of here!
What's the matter with you?

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:10.179
- Major Walsh, Major Walsh.
- Yes, sir.

01:35:10.346 --> 01:35:12.973
I'll have the rest of them
off the mountain in one hour.

01:35:13.182 --> 01:35:15.935
Major, I want you to use infrared...

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:18.687
...and get me a photo analysis of
the northern face.

01:35:18.896 --> 01:35:20.940
Yes, sir, it's already been ordered.

01:35:21.190 --> 01:35:23.233
Major Walsh, listen.

01:35:23.442 --> 01:35:26.987
I don't lik e to do this. We're in
enough trouble with these cattlemen.

01:35:27.237 --> 01:35:31.116
If you can't get these folks
out of the area by 2000 hours...

01:35:31.367 --> 01:35:33.661
...start dusting with EZ-4.

01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:35.537
What's EZ-4?

01:35:35.788 --> 01:35:39.166
It's a sleep aerosol. Same stuff we
used with the livestock.

01:35:39.375 --> 01:35:40.834
Comes out of Riot Control.

01:35:41.043 --> 01:35:44.964
They'll sleep for six hours and
wake up with a headache, that's all.

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:48.884
We didn't choose this place.
We didn't choose these people!

01:35:49.134 --> 01:35:51.220
They were invited!

01:35:57.268 --> 01:35:59.645
They belong here more than we.

01:36:07.361 --> 01:36:09.029
I shouldn't have given up jogging.

01:36:09.238 --> 01:36:12.616
See that notch in the mountain?
We'll make it in no time.

01:36:12.825 --> 01:36:14.410
Here come three more.

01:36:17.371 --> 01:36:19.331
The authority in this park...

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:23.085
...has been superseded by
the United States government.

01:36:23.419 --> 01:36:25.963
There's a ravine leading straight up.

01:36:26.171 --> 01:36:29.091
- It's an easier climb.
- It's no good.

01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:32.928
When you get to the top, it's
a 300-foot drop down. Get down!

01:36:33.137 --> 01:36:35.723
What do you think is
down on the other side?

01:36:36.432 --> 01:36:39.560
There's a box canyon on the other side
with ravines and trails...

01:36:39.768 --> 01:36:41.979
...if you take this incline
to the right.

01:36:42.187 --> 01:36:44.982
I never imagined that.
I only painted one side.

01:36:45.190 --> 01:36:48.110
- There was no canyon in my doodles.
- Next time, sculpt.

01:36:48.319 --> 01:36:51.238
You give us a lot of credit.
That's an hour's climb.

01:36:51.447 --> 01:36:52.615
Come on, let's go.

01:36:58.162 --> 01:37:00.748
The authority in this park...

01:37:00.956 --> 01:37:05.252
...has been superseded by
the United States government.

01:37:05.461 --> 01:37:10.007
You are entering
a military reservation...

01:37:10.257 --> 01:37:12.926
...and subject to military law.

01:37:13.135 --> 01:37:14.720
Call the bastard.

01:37:18.599 --> 01:37:20.601
Bahama, this is Pyramid. Over.

01:37:20.851 --> 01:37:22.019
Go ahead.

01:37:22.227 --> 01:37:24.563
Nothing to report at midstation.

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:27.650
Up ahead there's thousands
of places to hide.

01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:31.862
We'll need three times the men
to cover this in one hour.

01:37:32.154 --> 01:37:35.324
Get everybody off the northern face,
call the dark side of the moon...

01:37:35.574 --> 01:37:37.284
...and tell them we're gonna dust.

01:38:04.019 --> 01:38:05.396
Get down!

01:38:06.397 --> 01:38:09.191
You are entering a military
reservation...

01:38:09.441 --> 01:38:13.028
...and subject to military law.

01:38:42.641 --> 01:38:45.561
Larry! Larry, come on!

01:39:03.078 --> 01:39:06.248
Larry! Don't let them see you!
Get down!

01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:45.996
They're just crop-dusting.
Los Angeles!

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:52.920
- Larry?
- Don't stop!

01:39:53.504 --> 01:39:55.422
Don't look back! Come on, come on!

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:20.531
Roy!

01:40:26.829 --> 01:40:29.623
Hurry! We're only 10 feet
from the top.

01:40:29.873 --> 01:40:32.876
Just a few more feet! We can
slide down the other side!

01:40:40.217 --> 01:40:42.720
Come on, hurry. I'll come down.

01:40:42.886 --> 01:40:43.929
Don't come down.

01:40:44.972 --> 01:40:46.682
Come on, come on. Come on!

01:40:46.890 --> 01:40:49.018
- Don't worry. We'll make it.
- Roy.

01:40:49.184 --> 01:40:51.312
Come on. Come on. Move it.
Move your ass!

01:40:51.562 --> 01:40:52.980
Come on.

01:40:57.651 --> 01:41:01.363
Roy, come on. Come on.
Please, come on.

01:41:02.489 --> 01:41:03.616
Hurry!

01:41:05.868 --> 01:41:06.952
Hold it!

01:41:11.123 --> 01:41:12.249
Jump! Jump!

01:41:25.304 --> 01:41:28.349
- Do you see that?
- Oh, yes.

01:41:29.058 --> 01:41:30.184
Good.

01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:33.771
Is it on?
Check the speak er system here.

01:41:33.979 --> 01:41:36.148
I want this up all the way.

01:41:39.151 --> 01:41:40.694
Are you reading me on this one?

01:41:41.487 --> 01:41:42.780
How about here?

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:49.286
- Testing. Testing.
- Okay, one, two, three, four.

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:51.956
Testing. Testing.

01:41:52.164 --> 01:41:55.292
One, two, three, testing.

01:42:02.633 --> 01:42:06.428
Gentlemen, ladies.
Tak e your positions, please.

01:42:07.638 --> 01:42:09.598
This is not a drill.

01:42:09.807 --> 01:42:13.310
I repeat, this is not a drill.

01:42:14.311 --> 01:42:17.982
Could we have the lights
in the arena down 60 percent, please?

01:42:18.399 --> 01:42:20.067
60 percent.

01:42:24.405 --> 01:42:28.200
I don't think we could ask for
a more beautiful evening, do you?

01:42:37.042 --> 01:42:39.420
Okay, watch the skies, please.

01:42:40.129 --> 01:42:45.092
We now show uncorrelated targets
approaching from the north-northwest.

01:43:35.017 --> 01:43:38.103
We're the only ones who know.
The only ones.

01:43:47.738 --> 01:43:49.323
You see that?

01:43:51.367 --> 01:43:52.493
Yes.

01:43:53.285 --> 01:43:54.328
Good.

01:44:42.751 --> 01:44:47.256
All ground personnel not
D-class approved...

01:44:47.464 --> 01:44:51.302
...please evacuate the centre
approach mark er.

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:56.348
Audio analysis personnel,
behind the double yellow line.

01:45:02.396 --> 01:45:04.857
ITC, stereo, time and resistance.

01:45:05.524 --> 01:45:06.942
Auto ready?

01:45:07.610 --> 01:45:10.404
- Tone interpolation on interlock.
- Altitude and tabling.

01:45:10.613 --> 01:45:12.615
ARP and interlock now.

01:45:13.157 --> 01:45:15.659
Speed set at seven and a half.

01:45:15.868 --> 01:45:19.121
All positive functions, standing by.

01:45:43.562 --> 01:45:44.813
Go ahead.

01:45:45.147 --> 01:45:46.273
- Sunset.
- Go.

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:50.069
Okay. Start with the tone.

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:58.285
- Tang.
- Go.

01:45:59.328 --> 01:46:01.121
Up a full tone.

01:46:04.333 --> 01:46:06.126
Down a major third.

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.379
Now drop an octave.

01:46:13.467 --> 01:46:14.718
- Cool blue.
- Go.

01:46:14.969 --> 01:46:16.971
Up a perfect fifth.

01:46:19.556 --> 01:46:21.433
Nothing. Nothing at all.

01:46:26.397 --> 01:46:27.606
Give me a tone.

01:46:28.065 --> 01:46:30.276
- "Re" to the second.
- Up a full tone.

01:46:30.484 --> 01:46:32.361
- "Mi" to the third.
- Down a major third.

01:46:32.569 --> 01:46:34.655
- "Do" to the first.
- Drop an octave.

01:46:34.863 --> 01:46:36.573
"Do" up a perfect fifth.

01:46:36.782 --> 01:46:38.450
"Sol" to the fifth.

01:46:54.591 --> 01:46:55.843
I know that.

01:46:58.637 --> 01:46:59.805
Faster.

01:47:15.613 --> 01:47:16.739
Kick that mule!

01:47:20.993 --> 01:47:22.453
Let's go!

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:05.704
I'm very happy tonight.

01:48:06.121 --> 01:48:07.873
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:48:08.582 --> 01:48:11.794
Not a Merle Haggard, but it was great.

01:48:31.438 --> 01:48:32.815
Mr. Lacombe?

01:48:39.405 --> 01:48:42.116
What is it? What's happening?

01:49:37.713 --> 01:49:40.299
Come on. Come on, let's go.

01:49:41.926 --> 01:49:43.385
Keep down.

01:49:49.224 --> 01:49:50.809
They're talking way over my head.

01:51:00.379 --> 01:51:02.298
- Shit.
- Duck, duck!

01:51:38.417 --> 01:51:39.710
Photo one.

01:51:39.918 --> 01:51:43.297
Fantastic! Keep those reloads coming.

01:51:43.505 --> 01:51:45.049
Fantastic!

01:51:51.722 --> 01:51:53.807
- You wanna see better?
- I can see fine.

01:51:54.058 --> 01:51:57.144
- We can't stay here.
- I can.

01:51:58.103 --> 01:52:01.690
- Why?
- Because Barry's not here.

01:52:02.608 --> 01:52:04.610
I'm just not ready.

01:52:08.447 --> 01:52:10.574
I can't stay.
I've gotta get down there.

01:52:10.824 --> 01:52:12.326
I know.

01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:50.030
This is data control to all personnel.

01:52:50.447 --> 01:52:53.659
We monitor no biologic hazards.

01:52:53.867 --> 01:52:56.203
Range safety clear.

01:54:03.729 --> 01:54:06.482
Oh, my God.

01:54:59.994 --> 01:55:02.204
Oh, my God.

01:55:26.186 --> 01:55:27.479
Holy shit.

01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:21.802
There is a safety-hazard zone...

01:57:22.011 --> 01:57:25.889
...extending 25 metres from the ship.

01:57:26.307 --> 01:57:31.145
Special teams are exempt and
should be aware of low gravity.

01:57:31.395 --> 01:57:35.816
Expect some dizziness,
and look out for a static charge.

01:57:38.110 --> 01:57:41.947
All departments at operational
during this phase...

01:57:42.197 --> 01:57:44.366
...signify by beeping twice.

01:57:44.575 --> 01:57:47.620
If everything's ready here on
the dark side of the moon...

01:57:48.037 --> 01:57:49.622
...play the five tones.

01:58:59.149 --> 01:59:01.777
Give her six quavers, then pause.

01:59:02.903 --> 01:59:04.238
She sent us four quavers...

01:59:04.446 --> 01:59:07.741
...a group of five quavers,
a group of four semiquavers.

01:59:22.214 --> 01:59:24.466
All these phrases have
in common are five signals.

01:59:24.633 --> 01:59:27.970
- Hope somebody's taking all this down.
- What are we saying to each other?

01:59:28.137 --> 01:59:30.889
It seems they're trying to teach us
a basic tonal vocabulary.

01:59:31.098 --> 01:59:32.474
It's the first day of school.

01:59:40.816 --> 01:59:43.819
Take everything from the lady.
Follow her pattern note for note.

02:00:00.628 --> 02:00:03.213
We have a translation interlock
on their audio signal.

02:00:03.422 --> 02:00:05.799
We're taking over
this conversation now.

02:01:07.569 --> 02:01:09.405
Let's go! Come on!

02:02:46.126 --> 02:02:47.962
I am Claude Lacombe.

02:02:51.382 --> 02:02:52.800
Frank Taylor...

02:02:53.050 --> 02:02:55.594
...Lieutenant J.G., United States
Navy Reserve...

02:02:55.803 --> 02:02:57.721
...064199.

02:02:57.930 --> 02:03:00.224
Lieutenant, welcome home.

02:03:00.683 --> 02:03:02.434
This way to debriefing.

02:03:02.768 --> 02:03:03.811
Harry Ward Craig...

02:03:04.061 --> 02:03:06.146
...Captain, United States Navy...

02:03:06.355 --> 02:03:08.649
...043431.

02:03:08.857 --> 02:03:12.111
Captain, would you come
right this way?

02:03:13.988 --> 02:03:16.448
Welcome back, Navy. Welcome back.

02:03:18.367 --> 02:03:21.537
"Craig, Harry Ward.
Captain, United States Navy...

02:03:21.745 --> 02:03:23.789
...0434311."

02:03:24.081 --> 02:03:27.251
Disappeared off Chicken Shoals,
flight 19.

02:03:29.253 --> 02:03:32.965
Matthew McMichael, Lieutenant,
United States Naval Reserve...

02:03:33.549 --> 02:03:35.884
...0909411.
- Lieutenant.

02:03:36.093 --> 02:03:37.720
Good to have you back.

02:03:38.679 --> 02:03:40.889
Furlow, Otis B...

02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:44.059
...Lieutenant J. G.,
United States Navy.

02:03:44.268 --> 02:03:47.354
They haven't even aged.
Einstein was right.

02:03:47.563 --> 02:03:49.690
Einstein was probably one of them.

02:03:50.274 --> 02:03:52.526
Erickson, David A...

02:03:52.735 --> 02:03:55.821
...Lieutenant J. G.,
United States Navy...

02:03:56.113 --> 02:04:00.075
...0639552.

02:04:01.201 --> 02:04:03.579
Henkle, Robert F...

02:04:03.787 --> 02:04:07.207
...Lieutenant J. G.,
United States Navy...

02:04:34.485 --> 02:04:39.573
Went missing July 1955,
Pensacola, Florida.

02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:41.075
Monsieur Neary...

02:04:41.825 --> 02:04:43.494
...what do you want?

02:04:46.372 --> 02:04:49.541
I just wanna know that
it's really happening.

02:04:52.836 --> 02:04:57.716
I went up in the air,
and I saw our house.

02:04:57.925 --> 02:05:01.011
I saw you going up in the air.
Did you see me running after you?

02:05:01.178 --> 02:05:03.555
- Yes.
- Yes?

02:05:07.309 --> 02:05:09.395
All right, now we have to talk.

02:05:12.273 --> 02:05:14.275
He wants to speak about
Mr. Neary's case.

02:05:14.566 --> 02:05:17.152
Swensen, Matthew Daniel...

02:05:17.361 --> 02:05:20.948
...reported missing April 1976.

02:05:21.782 --> 02:05:24.618
- Are they going away?
- Yes.

02:05:28.956 --> 02:05:30.040
Wait a second, wait.

02:05:30.249 --> 02:05:34.336
He says these are ordinary people
under extraordinary circumstances.

02:05:35.546 --> 02:05:38.757
Delores, Rudolph E...

02:05:38.966 --> 02:05:42.553
...reported missing
December '51, Bisbee...

02:05:43.053 --> 02:05:44.597
...Arizona.

02:05:48.559 --> 02:05:50.394
Goodbye.

02:06:00.779 --> 02:06:01.822
Monsieur Neary...

02:06:03.991 --> 02:06:05.492
...I envy you.

02:08:03.861 --> 02:08:06.697
I'm told we can count on your
complete cooperation.

02:08:06.947 --> 02:08:09.450
- What's your blood type?
- I don't know.

02:08:09.658 --> 02:08:12.369
- What's your birth date?
- December 4th, 1944.

02:08:12.536 --> 02:08:14.997
Have you been inoculated against
smallpox, diphtheria?

02:08:15.247 --> 02:08:18.250
Is there any liver disease
in your family?

02:09:17.351 --> 02:09:19.895
May the Lord be praised at all times.

02:09:20.104 --> 02:09:22.815
May God help us and grant us
a happy journey.

02:09:23.065 --> 02:09:24.358
Show us your ways.

02:09:24.566 --> 02:09:26.443
And lead us along your paths.

02:09:26.694 --> 02:09:30.239
God has given you
his angels charge over you.

02:09:30.489 --> 02:09:34.034
Grant these pilgrims, we pray,
a happy journey...

02:09:34.285 --> 02:09:39.206
...and peaceful days, so that with
your holy angel as a guide...

02:09:39.415 --> 02:09:42.918
...they may safely reach their
destination...

02:13:24.181 --> 02:13:25.557
Bye!
