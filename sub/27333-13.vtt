KAROLINA:
Previously on Marvel's Runaways...

00:09.393 --> 00:12.483
-What's going on with PRIDE?
-They're declaring war. On you.

00:12.567 --> 00:14.278
New weapons, the whole shebang.

00:14.362 --> 00:15.698
ROBERT: These weapons
were designed specifically

00:15.782 --> 00:17.034
for our kids' powers.

00:17.117 --> 00:19.080
Need we remind you
of the mind-wipe drug we created

00:19.163 --> 00:20.583
for just such an occasion?

00:20.667 --> 00:22.504
You-- you came for me?

00:26.177 --> 00:27.429
The Radiance.

00:27.514 --> 00:29.475
After what happened to her at the crater,
she can't be alone.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.564
-Okay, then you can both go.
-I'm pregnant.

00:31.647 --> 00:33.483
NICO: She's a runaway now--
just like us.

00:33.568 --> 00:35.863
You still got that piece I gave you?
Hold it right.

00:35.947 --> 00:37.576
You don't know what's been done
with it, but I do.

00:37.659 --> 00:39.495
-Why do you want it?
-ALEX: Because I promised Livvie

00:39.580 --> 00:42.167
I would get justice for Darius's murder,
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

00:42.251 --> 00:45.842
-I was actually scared of that Staff.
-Maybe your darkness is you--

00:45.925 --> 00:48.430
your power--
like how my light is for me.

00:49.683 --> 00:50.893
-VICTOR: Son.
-Dad.

00:50.977 --> 00:52.187
Can you come home?

00:52.271 --> 00:54.358
-ALEX: What's going on?
-You're-- you're leaving?

00:54.442 --> 00:55.987
[crying] Chase, you can't do this.

00:56.070 --> 00:57.406
CHASE:
I'm goin' home.

00:58.366 --> 01:00.329
STACEY:
You can be the hero.

01:00.412 --> 01:03.293
All you have to do is step inside
and join us.

01:03.376 --> 01:05.798
-Promise me none of 'em get hurt.
-I promise, son.

01:05.882 --> 01:07.969
I'm Xavin. I've been looking for you.

01:08.679 --> 01:10.390
I don't want to scare you.

01:10.474 --> 01:12.102
Gert, did you stop taking your meds?

01:12.186 --> 01:13.355
I'm not Gert.

01:16.319 --> 01:18.323
I'm your betrothed.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.713
XAVIN:
No one knows the origins of this story.

01:25.797 --> 01:28.385
It passed down
through the generations

01:28.468 --> 01:31.182
until it was just a thing that is known.

01:31.265 --> 01:33.979
A truth. A prophecy.

01:34.063 --> 01:38.656
And at some point, the story
is heard by someone who comes to believe

01:38.739 --> 01:40.952
that the story is about them.

01:42.079 --> 01:44.375
Are they crazy to believe?

01:44.458 --> 01:46.755
Or would it be crazy not to?

01:47.674 --> 01:50.763
Because this story is a love story.

01:50.847 --> 01:53.644
A love story that unites two worlds

01:53.728 --> 01:55.982
and brings peace to the universe.

02:01.618 --> 02:04.875
And so a believer
stowed away on a ship

02:04.958 --> 02:08.214
that carried a family
of exiled Royal Magistrates

02:08.298 --> 02:10.845
at the center of the prophecy.

02:10.928 --> 02:14.101
But the stowaway
did not remain secret for long.

02:14.936 --> 02:19.153
Once exposed, the stowaway
became a help to them,

02:19.236 --> 02:23.662
and soon they had mastered
every skill needed to run the ship.

02:24.790 --> 02:27.837
But peace was not to last.

02:29.048 --> 02:31.553
All seemed lost.

02:31.637 --> 02:35.895
Perhaps the stowaway was not the one
spoken of in the prophecy.

02:35.978 --> 02:38.692
Maybe the prophecy was not even true.

02:39.736 --> 02:41.824
Death would have been a relief

02:41.907 --> 02:44.830
from the uncertainty
the stowaway suffered.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.296
Until there was a light from above.

02:49.380 --> 02:51.467
And it occurred to the stowaway

02:51.552 --> 02:54.473
that this had always been
a part of the prophecy,

02:54.558 --> 02:57.981
that they had crashed
in exactly the right place,

02:58.064 --> 03:01.613
because the light they saw
was their beloved.

03:03.283 --> 03:05.036
My beloved.

03:05.830 --> 03:07.124
My intended.

03:08.544 --> 03:10.297
My betrothed.

03:15.558 --> 03:16.852
Whoa.

03:17.896 --> 03:19.398
That was a trip.

03:25.786 --> 03:27.874
XAVIN:
Are you OK?

03:27.957 --> 03:32.257
I've never done that before
to someone...like you.

03:32.341 --> 03:33.886
I think so.

03:35.096 --> 03:38.938
A little invasive, but... beautiful.

03:39.021 --> 03:44.198
I used familiar concepts
to help you understand...

03:44.281 --> 03:47.329
and so we may find a common language,
and bond.

03:48.749 --> 03:51.420
I don't want you
to be frightened of me.

03:51.505 --> 03:52.966
I'm not scared.

03:53.049 --> 03:56.974
But I sense hesitation
in your response.

03:57.057 --> 03:59.896
It's not that I don't believe you.

03:59.980 --> 04:02.902
I believe that you believe.

04:02.986 --> 04:06.492
It's just a lot to take in.

04:11.712 --> 04:14.843
Our destinies are woven together
by prophecy.

04:14.926 --> 04:20.228
Is-- is there maybe a hard copy
of this prophecy that I could look at?

04:20.310 --> 04:24.319
Preferably written in English
and not projected into my brain.

04:27.618 --> 04:28.662
Wait, what are you doing?

04:28.746 --> 04:30.833
My savior. My soulmate.

04:30.916 --> 04:33.254
I've-- I've known you
for like five minutes.

04:33.337 --> 04:36.135
XAVIN: The love of my life.
Will you be my--

04:36.218 --> 04:37.764
NICO: Sorry.

04:37.847 --> 04:39.308
Am I interrupting?

04:42.064 --> 04:43.650
Who the hell is this?

04:49.996 --> 04:51.750
CHASE:
I understand what you're saying,

04:51.833 --> 04:54.589
but there is no way the other kids
are gonna come back without a fight.

04:54.672 --> 04:56.467
Well, the--
there is one way.

04:56.551 --> 04:58.931
-If you convince them.
-CHASE: Me?

04:59.014 --> 05:01.520
[laughs] No, I am the last guy
they'd listen to right now.

05:01.603 --> 05:02.730
They were mad when I left.

05:02.814 --> 05:04.859
Gert loves you.
I saw it with my own eyes.

05:04.943 --> 05:07.865
And heard it. From you.
A lot of love, Chase, so much.

05:09.201 --> 05:11.581
-Too much?
-CHASE: Gert called me a coward.

05:11.665 --> 05:14.086
To someone like her,
that is the worst thing you can be.

05:14.169 --> 05:17.050
Well, if an emotional plea won't work,
try logic.

05:17.134 --> 05:19.388
There's no longer any need
to stay away.

05:19.471 --> 05:22.435
Jonah's gone,
the past is in the past.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.818
We're asking for a second chance,
and we are offering everything we have.

05:25.901 --> 05:28.615
Doesn't change the fact
that you're still murderers.

05:28.699 --> 05:30.870
Your hands aren't exactly clean anymore.

05:30.953 --> 05:34.711
-Cat, we're trying the nice thing here.
-CHASE: Which I appreciate.

05:34.794 --> 05:37.592
But I woke up with a sore neck,
and I'm pretty sure

05:37.675 --> 05:41.725
it's because Nico stuck pins
in a voodoo doll with my name on it.

05:41.808 --> 05:44.898
Guys, I'm sorry, but I'm not
the right guy for this mission.

05:44.981 --> 05:47.277
I'm afraid you're the only guy.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.826
Son, you have got to give this
your best shot.

05:50.910 --> 05:53.832
Or what?
This whole conversation started

05:53.916 --> 05:55.502
with you saying that
none of 'em will get hurt.

05:58.090 --> 06:01.388
None of 'em will get hurt...
if you succeed.

06:01.472 --> 06:05.438
ROBERT: We have the weapons
necessary to achieve our goal.

06:05.522 --> 06:08.528
We don't want to use them. But...

06:08.612 --> 06:10.532
This is our last act of diplomacy.

06:10.616 --> 06:12.787
STACEY:
If they turn you down,

06:12.870 --> 06:16.085
there's no other choice.
It's war.

06:16.168 --> 06:18.715
And you know what happens in war.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.858
[theme music playing]

07:56.076 --> 07:58.456
How many kingdoms...

07:58.540 --> 08:02.255
how many lives were given
in pursuit of this treasure?

08:04.426 --> 08:06.598
"High-fructose corn syrup."

08:06.681 --> 08:09.979
Uh, many. Many lives.

08:10.062 --> 08:12.484
[laughs]
But for future reference,

08:12.568 --> 08:15.239
we don't really talk
with our mouths full.

08:15.866 --> 08:17.703
Apologies.

08:17.786 --> 08:21.586
Shapeshifter.
Still getting used to having a mouth.

08:21.669 --> 08:22.713
[Leslie chuckles]

08:28.057 --> 08:29.560
GERT:
They're not staying, right?

08:29.644 --> 08:30.812
Please tell me
they're just passing through.

08:30.896 --> 08:32.273
I don't know what Xavin's plan is,

08:32.357 --> 08:33.902
but it's definitely not leaving.

08:33.985 --> 08:36.448
I think it's more
like a quickie courthouse wedding,

08:36.533 --> 08:39.664
followed by eternal happiness
and wandering the universe.

08:39.746 --> 08:42.126
-Creepy.
-I didn't invite her.

08:42.210 --> 08:45.299
But she did stay on the ship,
and she survived our parents' attack.

08:45.383 --> 08:47.136
We have a responsibility.

08:47.220 --> 08:49.809
As for my mom, I don't know.
We haven't talked about it.

08:49.892 --> 08:52.690
Well, this can't be a halfway house
for pregnant PRIDE members

08:52.773 --> 08:54.359
and aliens with fairy tale fixations.

08:54.442 --> 08:56.238
Yeah, I agree. It's too risky.

08:56.321 --> 08:57.908
We don't have any idea
what Xavin's motives are,

08:57.992 --> 09:00.914
and your mom is untrustworthy,
to say the least.

09:00.998 --> 09:04.087
No more roommates who aren't
one hundred percent in.

09:04.170 --> 09:06.341
One is enough.
I don't need to say his name.

09:06.425 --> 09:09.097
-[phone ringing]
-It's Chase.

09:09.180 --> 09:11.310
What did I just say?!

09:11.393 --> 09:13.565
Do not pick up that phone,
Alex Wilder!

09:13.648 --> 09:15.276
-[ringing continues]
-Why not?

09:15.359 --> 09:16.403
OK, I get why not,

09:16.486 --> 09:18.282
but he wouldn't be calling
if it weren't important.

09:18.365 --> 09:20.537
What's important to us
is not important to him.

09:20.621 --> 09:22.541
Can you just decide? The sound
of the phone is really annoying.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.461
-[ringing]
-Alex.

09:24.545 --> 09:26.131
[stops ringing]

09:26.214 --> 09:29.387
-ALEX: Hey.
-Hey. Thanks for answering.

09:29.471 --> 09:31.726
I know Gert's gotta be standing here
making that face.

09:33.605 --> 09:36.276
-Um, no, not really.
-CHASE: Listen,

09:36.360 --> 09:38.030
I need you guys to meet me.

09:38.113 --> 09:39.742
ALEX: Yeah, dude,
that's not happening.

09:39.825 --> 09:41.829
I know you don't trust me,
and I get it,

09:41.913 --> 09:43.374
but if I were gonna rat you out
to our parents,

09:43.457 --> 09:44.877
they'd be in the middle
of your business already.

09:45.796 --> 09:47.925
Fair point. But still,

09:48.008 --> 09:50.137
- you're persona non grata right now.
-CHASE: I understand.

09:50.221 --> 09:53.770
You hate me. But Alex,
I'm trying to keep something...

09:53.853 --> 09:55.691
bad from happening.

09:55.774 --> 09:58.697
-Something really bad.
-Go on.

09:58.780 --> 10:00.116
I need to lay it out in person

10:00.199 --> 10:02.078
so everyone can make the decision
that's best for them.

10:04.416 --> 10:05.502
He wants to meet up.

10:08.257 --> 10:10.554
-They're interested. Continue.
-CHASE: OK.

10:10.637 --> 10:12.014
Pick the time and pick the place.

10:12.098 --> 10:13.727
Anywhere that you guys feel safe,
I'll be there.

10:13.810 --> 10:16.356
-I don't know...
-CHASE: Alex. Alex,

10:16.440 --> 10:19.070
please listen to me.
They have customized weapons.

10:19.154 --> 10:21.993
Serious firepower that
they're gonna use on you guys.

10:22.076 --> 10:23.872
I'm trying to keep that from happening.

10:28.631 --> 10:29.633
ALEX: OK.

10:29.717 --> 10:32.388
-[phone beeps]
-VICTOR: Chase?

10:34.267 --> 10:37.231
Hey. Uh, just called Alex.

10:37.315 --> 10:38.902
It's happening.
They agreed to meet.

10:42.074 --> 10:45.247
-Dad, you OK?
-Yeah. Yeah.

10:45.331 --> 10:46.834
What's going on?
Why are these specs up?

10:46.918 --> 10:49.380
Uh, I don't know.

10:49.464 --> 10:51.259
I don't know, they were like that
when I came down here.

10:51.343 --> 10:53.055
I just thought you left 'em running.

10:53.138 --> 10:54.474
I'm sure I didn't.

10:54.558 --> 10:56.019
Did you adjust these?

10:57.815 --> 10:59.442
Who made these changes?

10:59.527 --> 11:00.904
No, not me.

11:02.616 --> 11:03.827
Dad, are you all right?

11:03.910 --> 11:05.914
These have been tuned

11:05.997 --> 11:08.252
to make them considerably
more dangerous.

11:09.713 --> 11:11.258
Who's doing this?

11:14.974 --> 11:16.769
What is happening to me?

11:17.729 --> 11:19.315
CHASE:
It's getting worse.

11:19.399 --> 11:21.737
-The illness.
-Ohh!

11:21.821 --> 11:23.198
CHASE:
Whatever it is, it's progressing.

11:23.282 --> 11:26.873
VICTOR:
I have these, um, spaces

11:26.956 --> 11:28.793
where I feel like I'm drowning.

11:30.129 --> 11:31.507
CHASE:
Dad.

11:34.513 --> 11:36.308
We will beat this.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.312
I promise.

11:38.395 --> 11:40.441
But for now, please
change the specs back.

11:40.525 --> 11:43.656
If I fail, I don't want
anyone getting hurt...

11:43.740 --> 11:45.619
more than they have to.

11:46.286 --> 11:50.377
I can change the specs back
on the computer, but...

11:50.461 --> 11:52.507
the weapons have already
been produced.

11:54.845 --> 11:56.515
I'm afraid it's too late.

12:03.362 --> 12:06.493
When you were little,
still in a crib,

12:06.577 --> 12:09.959
we used to hear you in the morning,
calling out to us.

12:10.042 --> 12:13.549
"Somebody get the baby!"
[laughs]

12:13.633 --> 12:16.304
I'd come in your room
and you'd hold your arms out to me,

12:16.388 --> 12:18.726
and I'd pick you up and...

12:18.810 --> 12:22.526
for just a few minutes,
it was me and you.

12:22.609 --> 12:26.199
And I just wanted that
to go on and on.

12:26.282 --> 12:28.955
But it couldn't, could it?

12:29.038 --> 12:31.544
It's too late for us, Mom.

12:31.627 --> 12:36.219
You have to go, and be a better mom
to that baby than you were to me.

12:39.017 --> 12:40.979
So you won't forgive me, ever?

12:41.062 --> 12:42.899
Forgiveness is earned.

12:42.983 --> 12:46.072
Over time. With deeds, not words.

12:46.156 --> 12:48.703
Isn't that a fundamental Gibb teaching?

12:48.786 --> 12:50.874
Yes.

12:50.957 --> 12:54.715
Which is a whole other thing
to consider.

12:56.301 --> 12:59.767
After what happened in the crater...

12:59.850 --> 13:02.939
I'm certain you are
the new head of the church.

13:03.023 --> 13:04.693
What are you talking about?

13:04.777 --> 13:07.699
When you took to the sky
and spread your wings,

13:07.783 --> 13:10.747
you confirmed everything
in The Book of Gibborim.

13:10.830 --> 13:14.337
They're gonna be searching for you,
desperate for another encounter.

13:15.005 --> 13:18.261
You're the messiah now, Karolina.
Are you prepared for that?

13:18.345 --> 13:21.309
No. Definitely not.

13:21.392 --> 13:24.482
I can help you navigate all of that,
but not if you push me away.

13:24.566 --> 13:26.570
NICO: You're not coming
because you're not invited!

13:26.654 --> 13:29.158
-Chase doesn't even know you exist.
-XAVIN: I don't require an invitation.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.373
It should be assumed that I'd go along
to protect my betrothed.

13:32.456 --> 13:33.458
NICO:
She protects herself.

13:33.543 --> 13:34.795
And if she needs backup,
I've got it.

13:34.878 --> 13:36.172
-Guys--
-If that's the case,

13:36.256 --> 13:38.218
wouldn't it be better...

13:38.301 --> 13:40.055
if there were twice the backup?

13:40.139 --> 13:41.432
-[others gasp]
-NICO: Holy shit.

13:44.690 --> 13:46.652
Am I-- Am I really this small?

13:46.735 --> 13:48.321
Exact duplicate.

13:48.405 --> 13:50.284
KAROLINA:
Xavin, please change back.

13:50.367 --> 13:52.079
That creeps people out.

13:52.163 --> 13:55.127
-I agree.
-And I don't need your protection--

13:55.210 --> 13:57.298
or anyone's.

13:57.381 --> 14:01.055
I'm not so sure. Is it a bad idea
to bring all the help you can?

14:01.139 --> 14:03.561
Well, great.
Your mom gets a vote now?

14:03.644 --> 14:08.069
I must go on this mission.
It is my destiny to protect my betrothed.

14:08.153 --> 14:10.490
Stop it. I am no one's betrothed.

14:10.575 --> 14:12.621
Or their messiah.

14:12.704 --> 14:15.919
I decide where I go
and who I go with.

14:16.002 --> 14:18.716
And for today,
I'm sticking with my friends--

14:18.799 --> 14:20.427
my old friends.

14:20.511 --> 14:21.889
Sorry, Xavin.

14:21.972 --> 14:23.893
Then where does this leave me?

14:23.976 --> 14:27.191
For now, it leaves you here...

14:27.274 --> 14:30.322
to protect my mom and the house
until we get back.

14:31.491 --> 14:34.748
It is a noble endeavor
to guard the Holy Mother

14:34.831 --> 14:37.378
and the Haven. I accept.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.881
And one more thing.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.177
Would you stop calling me
your "betrothed"?

14:41.261 --> 14:43.933
-It's a weird word.
-As you wish.

14:59.005 --> 15:00.424
CHASE:
Looks good on you.

15:01.927 --> 15:04.432
Safety precaution.
No offense.

15:04.516 --> 15:06.019
GERT:
I would just like it noted

15:06.102 --> 15:08.440
that I am here under duress
and anything that I agree to

15:08.524 --> 15:09.943
should be considered as such.

15:10.027 --> 15:11.739
-MOLLY: She's really pissed at you.
-Totally aware.

15:11.822 --> 15:14.160
-We all are.
-If you can put aside your hurt feelings

15:14.953 --> 15:17.166
for one second, there are
more important things to discuss.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.838
GERT: More important than
the complete betrayal of your friends?

15:19.921 --> 15:21.800
I'm here with an offer
from our parents.

15:21.884 --> 15:24.096
NICO: Oh, my God, you're one of them.
-No I'm not.

15:24.180 --> 15:25.975
Makes total sense.
You always wanted to go home.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.687
OK, will you please listen?

15:27.771 --> 15:30.484
They're coming for you
with everything they've got.

15:30.568 --> 15:32.697
I've seen their weapons,
and you can't win.

15:32.781 --> 15:34.701
We've heard that before,
yet here we are.

15:34.785 --> 15:37.498
But this time it's different.
If they have to hurt you, they will,

15:37.582 --> 15:39.836
and believe me, they can.

15:40.922 --> 15:43.176
But they'd prefer you to come home
without a fight,

15:43.259 --> 15:45.848
and if you're willing to do that,
then PRIDE is ours.

15:45.932 --> 15:48.771
Why would we want
a totally corrupt organization

15:48.854 --> 15:50.733
and the hypocritical life
that comes with that?

15:50.817 --> 15:52.111
CHASE:
Because they would step back.

15:52.194 --> 15:54.115
They would let us run it
however we choose.

15:54.198 --> 15:57.956
We'd have resources for, I don't know,
feminist empowerment projects,

15:58.039 --> 16:00.920
feeding the poor,
educating the marginalized.

16:01.003 --> 16:04.135
The stuff you're always talking about,
we'd actually be able to do.

16:04.218 --> 16:07.224
You really think they would just disappear
and leave us alone?

16:07.307 --> 16:08.727
They're our parents. No way.

16:08.811 --> 16:10.565
Guys, you don't understand.

16:11.859 --> 16:13.319
This is your last chance.

16:13.403 --> 16:14.781
Take it or leave it?

16:18.455 --> 16:20.000
-I'll pass.
-NICO: Me too.

16:20.083 --> 16:22.087
They're gonna use the mind-wipe drug.

16:23.381 --> 16:24.968
All the connections,

16:25.051 --> 16:27.306
all the memories,
everything that binds us together,

16:27.389 --> 16:29.978
[stutters]
will be erased forever.

16:31.732 --> 16:34.236
That might not be
such a bad thing.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.284
-What?
-Some of us didn't even need a drug

16:37.367 --> 16:39.121
to destroy our connection.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.252
If you ask me...

16:42.336 --> 16:44.716
getting rid of my memories
sounds kind of good.

16:49.183 --> 16:51.522
Then I--I guess we're done here.

16:53.274 --> 16:54.653
I'm certain of it.

17:17.196 --> 17:19.034
[phone ringing]

17:23.126 --> 17:25.130
Great.

17:25.213 --> 17:26.257

17:27.384 --> 17:29.598
-Hello.
-TINA: Well?

17:29.681 --> 17:31.810
CHASE:
They turned me down.

17:31.893 --> 17:33.021
I'm not surprised.

17:33.104 --> 17:35.483
If I can get Alex alone, then maybe
I can still convince him.

17:35.568 --> 17:36.737
-If I can do that--
-No, too late.

17:36.820 --> 17:38.991
-Thank you for trying. We've moving on.
-CHASE: Wait. Tina--

17:40.745 --> 17:44.001
-TINA: I'm assuming you all heard that.
-GEOFFREY: We did.

17:44.084 --> 17:45.546

17:45.630 --> 17:48.969
DALE: Ahem! I'm starting to feel
a little... hyperventilating.

17:49.053 --> 17:50.973
Uh, do you mind if we could
just reconvene tomorrow?

17:51.057 --> 17:53.562
Stacey can drive
if you can't handle it.

17:53.646 --> 17:55.566
-Robert?
-ROBERT: Ready.

17:55.650 --> 17:57.779
-TINA: Victor?
-I've got everything I need.

17:57.862 --> 18:01.160
Let's do this. And Tina, remember,
make every shot count.

18:01.243 --> 18:02.622
We can't reload.

I'm scrambled.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.477
KAROLINA:
This drone is doing something to her!

18:58.232 --> 18:59.986
It's covered in solar protection
of some kind.

19:04.954 --> 19:06.541
They're jamming the electronics, too!

19:07.835 --> 19:10.298
-They thought of everything!
-[drone firing]

19:10.381 --> 19:12.553
We gotta split up!
We gotta try and lose 'em!

-NICO: We--

19:59.856 --> 20:01.191

20:02.528 --> 20:04.239
That thing has totally
scrambled your brain.

20:04.323 --> 20:05.826
Victor. Robert.
I ran out of darts.

20:05.910 --> 20:09.082
VICTOR: I knew
you couldn't control yourself.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.337
KAROLINA: We gotta get out of here.
I'm sure our parents are on their way.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.508
There's only one drone and two of us,
so if we split up,

20:13.592 --> 20:17.098
one of us definitely escapes--
but hopefully both.

20:18.142 --> 20:20.396
I-- I don't want--

20:20.480 --> 20:22.860
to leave...you.

20:23.695 --> 20:26.660
There's no leaving each other.
Not anymore.

20:27.452 --> 20:31.795
No matter where we go,
what the distance is between us,

20:31.878 --> 20:34.299
I will always come back to you.

20:35.343 --> 20:38.349
OK? Everything's gonna be all right,
I promise.

20:39.309 --> 20:40.562
I lamp you.

20:43.401 --> 20:44.946
I lump you.

20:45.864 --> 20:48.202

20:55.341 --> 20:58.222
OK, your mom
is definitely driving this thing.

20:58.305 --> 21:00.268
I'm gonna lead it away.

21:03.608 --> 21:04.694
Wait!

21:07.198 --> 21:08.660
I love you.

21:12.752 --> 21:14.087

but that was totally uncalled for.

22:00.179 --> 22:02.016
Yeah, sorry, dude.
Do you have insurance or something?

22:02.100 --> 22:05.481
Insurance is a corporate swindle invented
to capitalize on our inner fears.

24:47.138 --> 24:49.518
-What would you do?
-To be perfectly honest,

24:49.602 --> 24:51.772
we have not had very good luck
with aliens around here.

24:51.856 --> 24:54.277
I actually think you just
need to leave us alone.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.574
-I can't.
-You could!

24:56.657 --> 24:59.538
Karolina's so young,
and in some ways you're even younger.

24:59.622 --> 25:01.918
I think you need to go out
and create a life of your own,

25:02.001 --> 25:04.088
and come back
and see what happens.

25:04.172 --> 25:06.594
You're gonna want my help
when they come for the baby.

25:10.476 --> 25:13.065
-What?
-XAVIN: I read your
biomarkers immediately.

25:14.275 --> 25:16.781
The baby you're carrying
is of royal lineage.

25:17.950 --> 25:21.791
The Magistrate and his family
will not allow you to remain

25:21.874 --> 25:24.003
in sole possession
of one of their own.

25:25.130 --> 25:26.592
It isn't done.

25:28.513 --> 25:29.723
OK, wait.

25:30.850 --> 25:32.813
Wait, wait.

25:32.896 --> 25:34.900
The Magistrate.

25:35.902 --> 25:39.660
-Do you mean Jonah?
-That is what Karolina called him, yes.

25:39.743 --> 25:43.250
And his family-- What family?
We saw that ship explode.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.882
The others escaped when I did.
They are Gibborim.

25:46.966 --> 25:49.763
Unlike me. Xartan.

25:49.847 --> 25:54.565
But in their light form, I believe
they simply took on new hosts.

25:54.648 --> 25:56.401
A vessel that was nearby.

25:56.484 --> 25:59.950
-So he is still out there.
-XAVIN: Gathering his family, no doubt.

26:00.034 --> 26:03.040
And they are...

26:03.123 --> 26:06.547
to put it mildly, problematic.

26:08.885 --> 26:09.970
Wait.

26:11.766 --> 26:14.813
Wait, do you think
this meeting with Chase, this...

26:16.149 --> 26:19.030
Do you think this is part of Jonah's plan
to lure Karolina back?

26:19.113 --> 26:21.076
Very possible.

26:28.591 --> 26:32.181
She's come back out into the open.
Frogtown. Warehouse district.

26:32.264 --> 26:33.601
Where the hell are you, Victor?

26:33.685 --> 26:36.816
The last person to talk to me like that
works in a Malaysian toy factory

26:36.899 --> 26:39.822
-for fifteen cents an hour.
-Last person who talked to me like that

26:39.905 --> 26:41.867
doesn't talk anymore.

26:48.631 --> 26:50.552
[drone buzzing]

26:52.889 --> 26:55.269
-[clank]
-Yes!

26:56.062 --> 26:57.983
[panting]

26:58.066 --> 26:59.987
I lost her!

27:00.070 --> 27:02.158
VICTOR:
It's all right. I'm here.

27:03.285 --> 27:05.540
Though she has
locked herself inside.

27:12.888 --> 27:14.933
[birds chirping]

27:25.872 --> 27:26.957
What are you doin' out here?

27:27.041 --> 27:29.045
Just waiting for Dad to come back.

27:29.838 --> 27:33.261
-Are you worried?
-Shouldn't I be?

27:33.345 --> 27:35.474
Look, I know you love your friends.

27:38.021 --> 27:40.693
They made their choice....
and you made yours.

27:41.987 --> 27:43.240
It's time to move on.

27:44.242 --> 27:45.787
Aren't you ready for a new life?

27:45.870 --> 27:49.085
A new life where I'll remember my friends,
but they won't remember me?

27:50.128 --> 27:51.841
What kind of life is that?

27:51.924 --> 27:54.095
And don't offer to mind-wipe me.

27:59.063 --> 28:01.569
If you have to keep a secret...

28:01.652 --> 28:04.448
so that your friends can survive,
isn't it worth it?

28:04.533 --> 28:07.831
This is exactly the type of thinking
that got you in--

28:07.914 --> 28:10.210
got us into this mess!

28:11.505 --> 28:13.258
No more secrets.

28:16.014 --> 28:19.646
Dad's sick.
Sicker than he's ever been.

28:19.730 --> 28:22.777
Yeah, I've noticed some things.
But he's been through a lot.

28:22.861 --> 28:25.449
I think the tumor's coming back.

28:25.533 --> 28:27.621
And now, weirdly, his skin's flaking.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.252
Flaking how?

28:31.336 --> 28:33.549
White. Scaly.

28:36.680 --> 28:39.101
-Holy shit.
-What?

28:39.185 --> 28:41.064
It's not like dry skin's
worse than a brain tumor.

28:41.147 --> 28:42.734
I mean, maybe he just needs
a good moisturizer.

28:42.817 --> 28:43.903
No, I--

28:46.032 --> 28:48.829
I don't know how to explain it, but...

28:48.913 --> 28:51.543
he was in that healing algorithm
for a long time.

28:51.627 --> 28:53.923
And injected with Jonah's DNA.

28:54.006 --> 28:57.889
What if it's transforming your dad into--

28:57.973 --> 29:00.687
-Into an alien.
-Yeah.

29:00.770 --> 29:04.068
No, no, no. We can't let that happen.
We gotta save him.

29:04.151 --> 29:06.447
Maybe Dad already
gave us what we need.

29:11.374 --> 29:12.544
Come on.

29:16.593 --> 29:18.179
VICTOR:
Karolina.

29:20.142 --> 29:21.687
Sweetheart.

29:23.774 --> 29:25.778
Come on out, now.

29:28.951 --> 29:32.792
There's more at stake here
than just... parents and children.

29:35.047 --> 29:37.594
And anything you might be feeling--

29:37.677 --> 29:40.892
resentment, anger--

29:40.975 --> 29:43.564
it can all be overcome if we...

29:43.647 --> 29:46.862
just sit down together... and talk.

29:48.031 --> 29:50.243
There's no need
to make this difficult.

30:06.610 --> 30:09.365
-[rustling]
-Whoa.

30:09.448 --> 30:11.369
[coughs]

30:11.452 --> 30:13.289
[chuckling]
That was a good one.

30:13.373 --> 30:14.960
Why are you even after me?

30:15.043 --> 30:16.797
You already have Chase.
Why do I matter?

30:16.880 --> 30:19.176
Because you're more important.

30:19.260 --> 30:22.307
Stay down.
I don't want to have to do that again.

30:22.391 --> 30:25.021
I'm not getting up.
I'm getting into position.

30:25.105 --> 30:27.025
-For this.
-[object clatters]

30:28.654 --> 30:30.490
[Karolina groans]

30:34.498 --> 30:35.626
[sighs]

30:36.169 --> 30:37.672
-[clatter]
-[groans]

30:44.393 --> 30:47.024
-[clatter]
-[groans]

30:47.107 --> 30:49.361
[panting]

30:50.030 --> 30:51.950
VICTOR:
So strong.

30:52.034 --> 30:53.954
You make me proud.

30:57.169 --> 30:59.048
Hey! Don't touch that!

31:03.348 --> 31:06.897
Have no fear, my betrothed.
These are simple toys.

31:07.857 --> 31:11.740
Apologies, Karolina.
I'll try harder not to use that word.

31:11.823 --> 31:13.451
Xavin.

31:13.535 --> 31:15.665
Thought you died
in the explosion.

31:15.748 --> 31:17.251
Wishful thinking, I guess.

31:17.334 --> 31:20.382
Nothing will keep me from my destiny,
Magistrate.

31:20.465 --> 31:23.054
Oh, not this shit again.

31:23.137 --> 31:26.352
-Wait. You guys know each other?
-VICTOR: We did.

31:27.563 --> 31:31.697
But since we no longer have a ship,
we no longer have need of you.

31:32.532 --> 31:36.122
You have a nasty habit of inserting
yourself where you're not welcome.

31:36.205 --> 31:37.792
Let me help you with that.

31:37.875 --> 31:39.838
[Xavin cries out]

31:39.921 --> 31:41.424
[Victor exhales]

31:42.593 --> 31:45.641
You have no idea how much
that one can talk.

31:45.725 --> 31:47.436
Especially on a long trip.

31:48.522 --> 31:50.609
KAROLINA: Wait. Dad?

31:50.693 --> 31:53.782
Why are you doing this?
And how is it possible?

31:53.866 --> 31:56.872
I--I don't understand.
I watched you die.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.253
And I'm so sorry about that.

32:04.554 --> 32:06.892
Believe me, it was painful
for both of us.

32:07.935 --> 32:11.025
[sighs] But remember...

32:11.108 --> 32:13.947
I warned you
I was gonna take everything.

32:14.031 --> 32:15.576
That includes you.

32:18.791 --> 32:22.339
Well, that's gonna be a problem.

32:25.930 --> 32:28.309
-We have to get out of here.
-Do we?

32:28.393 --> 32:30.480
What if they're still out there?

32:30.564 --> 32:33.486
We can't just spend the rest of our lives
in a kiosk that sells men's socks.

32:33.570 --> 32:36.117
-I'll go first.
-No--

32:36.743 --> 32:41.252
How did you get to be the strong one?
I'm supposed to be the big sister.

32:41.335 --> 32:44.926
Where do you think
I learned it from? Come on.

32:50.771 --> 32:52.775
MOLLY:
There they are.

32:53.819 --> 32:55.196
-Wait. What?
-Go.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.033
Trust me.
Sisters forever, right?

32:59.622 --> 33:00.958
I'm on Molly.

33:01.751 --> 33:03.463
GERT: Everyone thinks
that you're the nice one.

33:03.547 --> 33:06.093
The levelheaded, concerned mom.
Another lie.

33:06.177 --> 33:07.889
STACEY: Honey, I understand
your disappointment.

33:07.972 --> 33:10.226
Every kid that learns
the truth about their parents

33:10.310 --> 33:12.439
thinks that they've discovered
something really big,

33:12.523 --> 33:14.527
but honestly, it's like finding out
the stove is hot.

33:14.611 --> 33:17.365
It hurts for a while,
and then you get a scar.

33:18.159 --> 33:21.040
-Honey, look! Our special hats!
-Not anymore.

33:21.123 --> 33:22.585
[Stacey groans]

33:28.304 --> 33:29.473
Damn it.

33:35.611 --> 33:37.239
-Mija, ponte en la línea.
-Ayudeme.

33:37.322 --> 33:38.407
Ese hombre me está
persiguiendo.

33:38.491 --> 33:39.536
DALE:
OK, OK.

33:39.619 --> 33:43.752
Sorry. She's got some
boundary issues. You know kids.

33:43.835 --> 33:46.340
But we've got a great therapist we're
workin' with out in the Palisades.

33:46.423 --> 33:47.927
Don't we, sweetie?

33:48.010 --> 33:51.016
No es mi papa.
No dejen que me toque.

33:51.100 --> 33:53.479
-What'd you just say?
-I thought you spoke Spanish, Dale.

33:53.564 --> 33:55.776
I do. Food, mostly.

33:55.859 --> 33:58.114
And you know,
some basic friendly salutation,

33:58.197 --> 33:59.909
which, judging by the looks
of these two,

33:59.993 --> 34:03.584
I could probably use about now.
[laughs nervously]

34:03.667 --> 34:05.378
Why don't we go home, sweetie, OK?

34:05.461 --> 34:07.424
¡Pedófilo! ¡Pedófilo!

34:07.508 --> 34:09.344
That one I understood.

34:09.428 --> 34:12.016
Pedophile?
I'm a concerned parent!

34:12.100 --> 34:13.687
Ya se, amigos, eh.

34:13.770 --> 34:15.815
Do you want some comida?
Ten-- tengo dinero.

34:26.963 --> 34:28.800
STACEY: Hi.
How much is this?

34:28.884 --> 34:30.804
Twenty bucks, two for thirty-five.

34:30.888 --> 34:34.226
Excellent. I'll take both.
Can you break a hundred?

34:34.311 --> 34:35.606
Ahh. I guess, maybe.

34:35.688 --> 34:38.277
You know, let me see if Chuck
at the incense stand has change.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.322
-Great.
-Chuck?

34:43.955 --> 34:46.503
What's happened to you?
This isn't the Stacey I know.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.884
No, it isn't.
It's a better version.

34:49.967 --> 34:52.347
Who doesn't need glasses?

34:52.429 --> 34:54.768
You know, between the poisoning
and the kidnapping,

34:54.851 --> 34:56.523
when did you have time
to get Lasik?

34:56.606 --> 34:58.777
We'll talk about that
when you're awake.

35:00.154 --> 35:01.407
Stacey!

35:07.127 --> 35:08.755
What did you do?

35:08.839 --> 35:11.720
STACEY: I did what was necessary
to restrain the youngling.

35:11.803 --> 35:13.431
Now help me with her extraction.

35:16.103 --> 35:18.399
Was my language
improperly understood?

35:21.948 --> 35:24.453
[engine roaring]

35:31.801 --> 35:33.680
[Alex panting]

35:37.353 --> 35:38.481
MAN: Hey!

35:57.435 --> 35:59.022
I don't see him.

35:59.857 --> 36:02.320
-Shit, we lost him.
-That's impossible.

36:02.403 --> 36:04.199
You saw him come down here,
right?

36:04.282 --> 36:06.286
Yeah, I did. Damn.

36:07.163 --> 36:09.501
-CATHERINE: Is it locked?
-GEOFFREY: Yeah, it's locked.

36:09.585 --> 36:11.631
CATHERINE: Try it again!
Okay, try the other door!

36:11.714 --> 36:13.050
GEOFFREY:
Over there.

36:15.429 --> 36:17.016
CATHERINE:
Where'd he go?

36:17.058 --> 36:19.412
GEOFFREY:
He could be gone.

36:31.044 --> 36:32.548
NICO: Mom?

36:34.175 --> 36:35.679
Come out!

36:36.096 --> 36:38.142
I know you're behind all this!

36:43.862 --> 36:46.158
[waves pulsating]

36:46.241 --> 36:48.622
Oh...
you didn't think the drones

36:48.705 --> 36:51.460
were the only thing
with a subsonic wave generator...

36:52.963 --> 36:54.717
did you?

36:54.800 --> 36:57.013
We have plans inside of plans.

36:58.098 --> 36:59.852
-Flip you.
-TINA: I love what it does

36:59.936 --> 37:00.979
to your language center.

37:01.063 --> 37:02.440
It's really kind of funny.

37:02.524 --> 37:05.530
I don't mangle wander
in order to...glue this!

37:06.156 --> 37:08.620
Good thing we sent the employees
home early.

37:10.707 --> 37:13.713
Seriously, Nico, what do you think
this will accomplish?

37:15.257 --> 37:16.719
Don't make me fight you.

37:16.803 --> 37:18.055
Fly me.

37:19.642 --> 37:21.311
Cry ski--

37:21.395 --> 37:22.940
[grunts]

37:27.198 --> 37:28.492
Yahh!

37:31.373 --> 37:33.377
[Nico groans]

37:38.178 --> 37:41.393
Last time I just had to stand by
and watch. This time I can't.

37:41.476 --> 37:44.775
Nico, this is the last chance.
Please come home.

37:46.529 --> 37:47.698
[Nico cries out]

38:02.853 --> 38:05.692
[all grunting, yelling]

38:25.982 --> 38:27.820
Now I can tell you
what I really think of you.

38:27.903 --> 38:29.698
Don't waste your breath.

38:29.782 --> 38:31.451
So sorry, sweetheart.

38:31.536 --> 38:33.873
[waves pulsating]

38:36.796 --> 38:38.550
[Nico roars]

38:46.774 --> 38:49.905
[Nico groaning]

38:55.374 --> 38:57.461
[roars, grunts]

39:27.438 --> 39:29.400
[crackling]

39:32.281 --> 39:33.868
Tina, what did you do?

39:33.952 --> 39:36.958
This isn't me.
But I've seen this before.

39:43.638 --> 39:47.813
[echoing] Smash!

40:18.958 --> 40:20.587
Robert?

40:20.670 --> 40:22.381
Are you... OK?

40:24.762 --> 40:26.348
Did you see her, Tina?

40:27.475 --> 40:29.103
What's happened to Nico?

40:30.523 --> 40:33.613
There may have been some things
about the Staff I didn't tell you.

40:36.076 --> 40:38.163
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

40:38.246 --> 40:40.752
Don't worry. Don't worry.
Don't worry.

-CATHERINE: Was that a gunshot?

40:46.012 --> 40:47.849
GEOFFREY:
Yeah. Come on.

40:51.732 --> 40:53.360
Is he on the phone?

40:55.114 --> 40:58.538
Wow. You guys really think
you're untouchable, huh?

40:58.621 --> 41:00.374
It would just be easier
if you got in the car.

41:00.457 --> 41:02.211
Oh, I'm not getting in that car.

41:02.294 --> 41:04.633
And if I were you guys,
I'd put those weapons down.

41:04.716 --> 41:07.931
LAPD has a little thing
about black folks waving guns around.

41:10.102 --> 41:12.649
We don't want to do this, Alex.
Don't make us.

41:12.732 --> 41:15.070
I never made you do anything.

41:15.154 --> 41:18.285
And let's be clear.
Everything that you guys have done

41:18.368 --> 41:20.289
has been your choice.

41:20.372 --> 41:22.084
Nobody forced you to kill those kids.

41:24.130 --> 41:26.342
Or to pull that trigger on Darius.

41:28.138 --> 41:30.267
You did that 'cause you wanted to.

41:32.564 --> 41:34.066
And now I get it.

41:35.110 --> 41:37.616
It kinda feels good
to take somebody's life away.

41:38.576 --> 41:40.788
Because with a little help from Tamar

41:40.872 --> 41:43.794
and an anonymous note
to a cold case detective--

41:43.878 --> 41:45.715
[siren wails]

41:45.798 --> 41:48.053
It's dominoes, bitch. Wash 'em!

41:48.136 --> 41:49.556

41:49.640 --> 41:51.017

Hold it right there!

41:51.100 --> 41:53.773
Don't move.
Hands on your heads.

41:53.856 --> 41:56.486
-Just wait a minute, OK? Just wait.
-What's this all about?

41:56.570 --> 41:58.533
We got a call about shots fired.

41:58.616 --> 42:02.039
-And you just assumed it was us?
-There's a lawsuit waiting to happen.

42:04.001 --> 42:06.047
It was on the seat.
Still warm from being fired.

42:06.130 --> 42:08.343
Got a tip about one of these.
If the bullets match,

42:08.426 --> 42:10.264
someone's getting a promotion.

42:10.347 --> 42:11.559
This your vehicle?

42:11.642 --> 42:15.065
As his lawyer,
I'm advising him not to answer.

42:15.148 --> 42:17.194
They're just gonna run the plates, Cat.

42:18.446 --> 42:20.409
Yeah. It's mine.

42:20.492 --> 42:22.581
-Both of you turn around.
-Slowly.

42:31.347 --> 42:33.853
CHASE:
Wait. Did you kill her?

42:34.563 --> 42:36.190
Why would I do that?

42:37.527 --> 42:38.613
She's my daughter.

42:39.990 --> 42:41.075
What?

42:41.159 --> 42:43.288
That prototype is of no use.

42:44.583 --> 42:46.587
-Chase, just throw it.
-[Victor sighs]

42:52.181 --> 42:54.603
I'm really disappointed.

42:54.686 --> 42:57.358
Both of you should be
quicker on the uptake.

42:58.485 --> 43:00.615
If I wanted to use these
on Karolina,

43:00.698 --> 43:01.992
I'd need to protect myself.

43:02.076 --> 43:04.581
This suit is lined
for that specific reason.

43:04.665 --> 43:08.338
But the inhibitors are for...aliens.
That should have worked.

43:08.421 --> 43:10.968
But that's not any alien in there.

43:13.181 --> 43:14.768
That's Jonah.

I know I haven't exactly been
the Father of the Year lately,

43:59.023 --> 44:01.444
but I think in time
you will realize

44:01.528 --> 44:02.572
that what I'm doing is actually

44:02.655 --> 44:04.492
-for your own...
-For my own good.

44:05.870 --> 44:08.333
Please, that's not possible
if it involves being kidnapped

44:08.416 --> 44:10.337
and forced to run away
with you and Mom.

44:10.420 --> 44:13.636
-I agree with you on that.
-Where is Mom?

44:13.719 --> 44:16.265
DALE: Well, honey, that's kind of who
we're running away from.

44:16.349 --> 44:17.434
What?!

44:17.519 --> 44:20.440
Your mom's been acting
a little strange lately.

44:20.525 --> 44:22.570
Erratic. Violent.

44:22.654 --> 44:24.699
Actually, some might say
bloodthirsty.

44:24.783 --> 44:26.077
-You don't say.
-DALE: And your sister,

44:26.160 --> 44:28.958
thankfully, she got away safely,
so I thought the best thing for us to do

44:29.041 --> 44:30.377
would be go on the road.

44:30.460 --> 44:33.509
Off the grid. Just until your mom
works through her issues.

44:33.592 --> 44:35.805
-OK, So let me get this straight.
-DALE: OK.

44:37.140 --> 44:40.397
My murderous father
is taking me on the lam

44:40.480 --> 44:44.488
because he's afraid of
my even more murderous mother.

44:44.573 --> 44:46.200
Pretty much nailed it.

Wha-- Dale!

44:51.879 --> 44:54.341
You know me--

44:54.425 --> 44:58.266
You and I, we have not
gone on a road trip in a long time.

44:58.349 --> 45:00.312
We're gonna have fun,
we're gonna listen to some tunes yo,

TINA: I had a medical emergency
with Robert.

45:41.227 --> 45:44.441

these host personalities in check.

-Unfortunately, no.

He's our son. And you know
how unpredictable he is. Wild.

45:56.340 --> 45:58.929
Perhaps he's struggling
with his host as well.

45:59.013 --> 46:01.643
That still doesn't answer the question
of Brother's whereabouts.
