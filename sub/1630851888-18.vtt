16:21.230 --> 16:23.648
- Is this one of the things
that you feel like

16:23.732 --> 16:25.641
you are starting
to give your wife,

16:25.726 --> 16:27.560
that you're compromising on

16:27.653 --> 16:28.811
<i>so that you can make
your relationship work?</i>

16:28.895 --> 16:29.979
- Oh, for sure.

16:30.063 --> 16:31.572
There's already
a couple of other trips

16:31.657 --> 16:32.648
that we've already booked
as well, too,

16:32.741 --> 16:33.825
and so it's just
one of these things--

16:33.984 --> 16:35.576
- Oh, look at you.
You're travel daddy now.

16:35.736 --> 16:36.661
<i>Okay, I see you. Okay.</i>

16:36.745 --> 16:37.829
<i>Jose's being a little flexible.</i>

16:37.913 --> 16:39.739
- Yes!
<i>- I like that.</i>

16:39.823 --> 16:41.824
<i>All right, I have
a never-before-seen clip</i>

16:41.908 --> 16:44.160
<i>I want to play of Rachel
talking to her friend.</i>

16:44.244 --> 16:46.587
<i>Now, Jose, you might be
a little surprised to hear</i>

16:46.747 --> 16:51.584
<i>that Rachel didn't really know
what you do for a living.</i>

16:51.668 --> 16:53.335
- [laughs]
<i>- Just watch.</i>

16:53.420 --> 16:56.005
- I like that he is passionate
about what he's doing.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.682
- What does he do?
- Good question.

16:57.766 --> 16:59.350
[laughter]

16:59.509 --> 17:01.686
So what's so funny,
it's like, he asked me

17:01.770 --> 17:04.272
and he--you know,
he talked forever.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.848
- Yeah.
- And I was like, "Okay.

17:05.932 --> 17:08.017
That's awesome.
That's interesting."

17:08.101 --> 17:09.527
And then, like,
a couple days later,

17:09.686 --> 17:12.530
I'm like, "I don't think
I quite understand,"

17:12.614 --> 17:14.032
so I'd have
to ask him again, like--

17:14.191 --> 17:16.367
- Oh, okay.
- "Wait, what is it you do?"

17:16.526 --> 17:18.703
And he would
explain it all again to me.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.955
So he works at the Space Center.

17:21.114 --> 17:22.281
- Okay.
- Okay?

17:22.365 --> 17:24.792
And he is...

17:24.951 --> 17:28.621
his official title--he says,
like, mission specialist...

17:28.705 --> 17:29.547
- Mm-hmm.

17:29.631 --> 17:30.965
- There's another word in there.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.550
Mission specialist something.

17:32.709 --> 17:34.543
You know, he doesn't go
into space.

17:34.628 --> 17:36.045
I know that.
- Okay, but what does he do?

17:36.138 --> 17:37.221
- But I do know what he does.
- Yeah?

17:37.306 --> 17:38.964
- Okay, so the astronauts
have space suits.

17:39.058 --> 17:39.974
- Okay, okay.

17:40.133 --> 17:41.976
- He kind of, like,
customizes them.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.562
Every suit has a million
little pieces that go into it.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.472
And it's very interesting.
- Okay.

17:46.556 --> 17:48.066
- I'm sure, as time goes on,

17:48.150 --> 17:49.734
I will understand it
more and more,

17:49.893 --> 17:52.311
but it's literally,
like, rocket science for me.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.814
- [laughs]

17:54.907 --> 17:56.899

do have their space suits,

18:06.076 --> 18:09.754

with many individual parts.

18:09.913 --> 18:12.164
He has to make sure
it's the right piece

<i>- Okay. Wanted to make sure.</i>

20:20.543 --> 20:21.636
Have you kept in touch?

being around Brett.

Can we go back to
the beginning, though, first?

20:40.405 --> 20:43.574
Because you guys had
a pretty good first week

20:43.659 --> 20:45.901
on the honeymoon,

<i>hugs and kisses,

<i>Was that all smoke and mirrors,</i>

21:03.679 --> 21:04.845
<i>or were you really--
You were there?</i>

21:05.005 --> 21:06.005

We were--
- Yeah.

21:07.257 --> 21:09.341

enjoying everything

difficult stuff to deal with.

21:12.262 --> 21:13.688
The--the honeymoon was easy.

21:13.847 --> 21:15.690
The wedding was incredible.

21:15.849 --> 21:18.434
The issues that we had
came later on.

21:18.518 --> 21:19.860
- Let's talk about
some of those issues.

21:19.945 --> 21:24.106
Brett, people kept telling you
you weren't Ryan's type.

21:24.190 --> 21:26.108
Did that begin to weigh on you
and upset you?

21:26.201 --> 21:29.287
- It's not fun to hear it
that many times.

21:29.371 --> 21:32.373
And there's nothing I could do
to change being someone's type,

21:32.457 --> 21:34.041
but I don't think it affected me

21:34.126 --> 21:36.452
or hurt me in any way.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.629
<i>- Mm-hmm. Uh, let's talk
about another issue.</i>

21:38.714 --> 21:39.714
Brett, you also felt that,

21:39.873 --> 21:41.373
like, Ryan was keeping things
from you,

21:41.458 --> 21:43.792
that he wasn't being
as open as he could be.

21:43.885 --> 21:45.461
He was sharing
with everybody but you.

21:45.545 --> 21:46.879
- Yeah, yeah.
<i>- His wife.</i>

21:46.963 --> 21:49.223
<i>Ryan also felt that
he was trying to protect you</i>

21:49.308 --> 21:51.467
by not being 100% honest.
- Right.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.811
- Do you see that
in this situation?

21:53.895 --> 21:56.731
- No, I definitely have
always felt that from him.

21:56.890 --> 21:59.150
I know that
that's likely the reason.

21:59.234 --> 22:01.068
You're gonna hurt
someone's feelings regardless

22:01.153 --> 22:02.895
if you have to tell them
something that you don't like.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.563
It's just prolonging it.

- Kind of, yeah. Yeah.
- No chaser, right? Yeah.

22:10.653 --> 22:12.830
Ryan, do you regret that?
- I do.

22:12.914 --> 22:15.240
I could have went about things
a lot different

22:15.334 --> 22:16.492
as far as communication.

And she's right that,
at the end of the day,

22:18.420 --> 22:20.996
it's inevitably gonna
still hurt that person,

22:21.089 --> 22:24.508
whether it's initially
or--or drawn out.

22:24.667 --> 22:25.918

<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

22:26.011 --> 22:27.678
- Will you be a better
communicator in the future?

22:27.763 --> 22:28.754
- Absolutely.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.589
- Brett, did you see
any growth in him

<i>during this process?</i>

<i>That answer said it all
right there.</i>

22:39.432 --> 22:42.184
Ryan, what did you learn about
yourself through this process?

22:42.277 --> 22:44.019
- I've been so quick
in relationships

22:44.112 --> 22:48.690
to jump
into the physical side of it,

22:48.775 --> 22:50.859
and I learned that--
Well, I've always known

22:50.944 --> 22:54.205
that there's obviously emotions
that come with that.

22:54.364 --> 22:56.957
I just didn't always
consider those emotions

22:57.117 --> 22:58.534
for the other person,
and that was--

22:58.627 --> 22:59.868
- You acted like a guy.
It's okay.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.212
- Yeah.
Yeah, and that's something

23:01.296 --> 23:04.706
that I really was mindful of
in our relationship,

23:04.791 --> 23:09.962
was I didn't want
to push that issue,

23:10.055 --> 23:14.141
have that agenda when
we emotionally weren't there.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.301
That's one thing I learned,
that I can be patient

23:16.386 --> 23:17.469
<i>when it comes to that.</i>

23:17.562 --> 23:19.063
- Brett, what about you?
What did you learn?

23:19.147 --> 23:21.056
- I think that

23:21.141 --> 23:25.986
going through a relationship
that you didn't choose,

23:26.146 --> 23:28.823
you know, you didn't choose
based on,

23:28.907 --> 23:30.825
"Oh, that guy's cute and I'm
gonna go give him my number,"

23:30.909 --> 23:32.660
or like, "Oh, we both
have this in common.

23:32.819 --> 23:35.070
I'm gonna--I want to date you,"

23:35.155 --> 23:39.333
being faced with a lot
of differences on the surface,

23:39.492 --> 23:41.836
and that kind of taught me that

23:41.995 --> 23:44.580
I think I can be
more open-minded

23:44.664 --> 23:46.340
than I originally thought

23:46.499 --> 23:49.084
when it comes to who I date
or who I spend time with.

23:49.177 --> 23:52.004
And I think going forward,
you know,

23:52.088 --> 23:55.591
we can expand the horizons
a little bit.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.601
- Do you think that
if you could rewind, Ryan,

23:57.760 --> 23:59.761
there were some things
you'd do differently?

23:59.855 --> 24:00.846
- If I could do it
all over again,

24:00.939 --> 24:02.940
I would be more open with her

24:03.099 --> 24:05.267
and have the tough
conversations that

24:05.360 --> 24:08.279
neither of us wanted to have.

you know?

32:59.635 --> 33:02.229

dog in your life coming up?

33:02.388 --> 33:03.388
- [sighs] You know, I want to,

33:03.481 --> 33:05.557
but I don't think
I have time right now.

33:05.641 --> 33:07.392
It might have to wait
until next summer.

33:07.476 --> 33:09.644

Now that you look back on this,

33:09.729 --> 33:11.312
is it easier to walk
through the little steps,

33:11.397 --> 33:12.656
<i>as you look back at the steps,
and say,</i>

33:12.815 --> 33:14.649
<i>"Doggone it.
That was the wrong thing"?</i>

33:14.734 --> 33:16.493
'Cause you're talking so calmly

33:16.652 --> 33:18.820
about all these issues
that happened.

33:18.913 --> 33:21.573
- I think--and you can
correct me if I'm wrong--

33:21.666 --> 33:25.419
I think when you--you date
someone, you fall for them,

33:25.503 --> 33:28.163
and then you have a breakup
or a blowout,

33:28.247 --> 33:30.832
there's a lot of, like, emotion
and feelings and contention

33:30.925 --> 33:32.342
and "you did this"
and "you did that,"

33:32.427 --> 33:36.171
and we never really got to that
point in the first place.

33:36.264 --> 33:40.341
We never, like,
emotionally, deeply connected.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.260
Like, we never got
to that point.

33:42.344 --> 33:44.855
So for us
to, like, call it quits

33:44.939 --> 33:49.267
on something that never really,
like, got there,

33:49.360 --> 33:51.186
there's--there's, like,
not a reason to have,

33:51.270 --> 33:55.190
like, animosity or, like,
arguments over this and that

33:55.274 --> 33:57.609
because we're both just like,
"This is what happened

33:57.693 --> 33:59.527
and it didn't work out,
so okay."

33:59.612 --> 34:03.198
I know we're both disappointed
that it didn't, like,

34:03.291 --> 34:04.374
turn into what we both wanted

34:04.533 --> 34:06.376
'cause we both signed up
to do the same thing

34:06.535 --> 34:08.787
and to get married and to have
a family and all of that,

34:08.871 --> 34:11.465
but I think when, you know,

34:11.624 --> 34:13.291
you're still
in that beginning stage

34:13.375 --> 34:15.877
and then it kind of ends,

34:15.970 --> 34:18.889
it is easier
to deal with because--

34:19.048 --> 34:22.300

like, a multiple-week breakup,

34:22.384 --> 34:24.061

34:24.145 --> 34:25.812

It was a slow--

34:25.971 --> 34:28.223
A slow breakup.
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

34:28.316 --> 34:30.141

crossing paths

34:30.234 --> 34:31.309

34:31.402 --> 34:33.153
Both: Yeah.
- We're definitely friends.

34:33.312 --> 34:35.396
I mean, you don't--

34:35.481 --> 34:38.241
Like, I feel like
we're, like, war buddies.

34:38.400 --> 34:42.487
You know, it's like we kinda
went through this really...

34:42.571 --> 34:46.908
stressful, like, transformative,

34:46.992 --> 34:49.911
reflective, like, fun,
crazy thing together,

34:49.995 --> 34:52.080
so, like, of course
we're gonna be friends.

It's the nature of it.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.167

35:07.429 --> 35:08.396
- You got it.
<i>- All right. Thanks, y'all.</i>

35:12.443 --> 35:14.269
Now, this next couple
had a slow build,

35:14.353 --> 35:16.354
but they were both committed
to their marriage

35:16.438 --> 35:18.273

as they got to know each other,

35:18.357 --> 35:20.024

35:20.109 --> 35:21.109

35:21.193 --> 35:23.611

35:23.696 --> 35:26.373

that first kiss.

57:31.531 --> 57:33.440
for somewhat of a lifetime.

57:33.533 --> 57:34.783
But, yeah,
when I heard the news,

57:34.942 --> 57:37.194
I was--I was kind of devastated
for him, for sure.

57:37.278 --> 57:40.706
- Yeah, Johnny, how about you?
'Cause you know Myrla well.

57:40.790 --> 57:42.699
- Yeah.
Uh, I was really shocked

57:42.783 --> 57:45.127
'cause I feel like
Myrla and Gil,

57:45.211 --> 57:47.787
I didn't really see
any negatives.

57:47.872 --> 57:49.372
I thought they were,
like, the golden couple

57:49.466 --> 57:50.466
after these guys.

57:50.550 --> 57:53.302
So when y'all,
after Decision Day,

57:53.461 --> 57:55.721
both said yes, I was like,
"Wow," you know?

57:55.805 --> 57:58.056
Everything seemed fine.
So it was strange.

57:58.141 --> 58:00.800
- I think, yeah,
it's shocking to everybody.

58:00.885 --> 58:02.302
- Never in my life
I've been insecure

58:02.386 --> 58:04.897
about somebody being with me,
but I would absolutely say

58:04.981 --> 58:08.475
that is a--
My number one insecurity now.

58:08.559 --> 58:11.144
<i>- Mm-hmm. Okay.</i>

58:11.237 --> 58:13.155
Nothing's forever.
- So they say.

58:13.314 --> 58:14.981
- And by the way, I'm sure
your DMs are blowing up.

58:15.066 --> 58:16.325
[laughter]

58:20.163 --> 58:21.997
I've got more questions,
so let's keep going.

58:22.156 --> 58:23.165
Zack, you had a long list
of things that you wanted

58:23.249 --> 58:24.750
for the perfect wife,

58:24.834 --> 58:27.327
and you also admitted
that you were a perfectionist.

58:27.411 --> 58:30.080
<i>Has anything changed
since your marriage?</i>

58:30.164 --> 58:32.749
- Um, I mean,
I have the same mindset, like,

58:32.833 --> 58:35.344
in life,
and I still want the best.

58:35.428 --> 58:37.095
I want to be the best,
I want to--

58:37.180 --> 58:38.922
I want the best
for my friends and family.

58:39.006 --> 58:42.175
In terms of a spouse, though,
I--I am, like,

58:42.268 --> 58:43.435
you know, she doesn't need to do

58:43.520 --> 58:44.761
this, this, and this
and this and this, right?

58:44.845 --> 58:46.429
There can be compromises.

58:46.514 --> 58:48.190
So I do think
that, like, I've learned that

58:48.274 --> 58:49.516
that type of mindset,

58:49.600 --> 58:51.610
that, you know, something can
always be better,

58:51.694 --> 58:53.946
isn't the right mindset to have
when you're looking for,

58:54.105 --> 58:55.021
you know, the one.

58:55.106 --> 58:56.365
So I think
I've definitely changed.

58:56.449 --> 58:57.440
- Gil has thoughts
on everything.

58:57.534 --> 58:58.942
I want to hear
his thoughts on this.

58:59.035 --> 59:01.203
[laughter]

59:01.287 --> 59:06.366
- I think we all came in here,
um, expecting something.

59:06.450 --> 59:11.046
Um, obviously, we let
the experts do their thing

59:11.205 --> 59:13.882
and crossed our fingers
and hoped for the best.

59:14.041 --> 59:17.460
And when it comes down to Zack,
he just expected,

59:17.554 --> 59:21.223
you know, her to be something
that he envisioned,

59:21.382 --> 59:23.559
and, unfortunately,
it wasn't that.

59:23.643 --> 59:26.228
And it wasn't something
that he could compromise

59:26.387 --> 59:28.805
because he wouldn't be true
to himself.

59:28.889 --> 59:30.640
- Well said.

59:30.733 --> 59:32.559
- I want to talk about Rachel
and Jose for a second.

59:32.643 --> 59:34.736
<i>And were you guys surprised
when you heard they broke up?</i>

59:34.895 --> 59:36.822
And, you know,
now they are back together,

59:36.981 --> 59:38.315
<i>spending time together.</i>

59:38.399 --> 59:40.242
<i>Jose, I'm not trying
to make you sweat, um, but--</i>

59:40.401 --> 59:41.651
- Hey,
that's what you're doing, man.

59:41.744 --> 59:44.246
Put me on the hot seat, man.
That's what it's been.

59:44.330 --> 59:46.164
- I wasn't surprised
that they broke up

59:46.249 --> 59:48.658
just because I know you guys
had been going through it.

59:48.751 --> 59:51.328
I know it was, like, a tough
situation to get over.

59:51.412 --> 59:52.746
I was more surprised
they got back together.

59:52.830 --> 59:54.247
- Were you?

59:54.332 --> 59:56.258
- Yeah, just because of what
you guys have went through.

59:56.417 --> 59:58.677
But it just--
It's a testament to, like,

59:58.836 --> 59:59.836
your guys' strength.

59:59.920 --> 1:00:00.920
Like, I know
you worked hard for that.

1:00:01.005 --> 1:00:03.015
Like, I know you worked
your ass off

1:00:03.099 --> 1:00:04.182
to get back in her life.

1:00:04.342 --> 1:00:05.508
And, like,
I really appreciate that, Jose,

1:00:05.593 --> 1:00:07.260
because, like, not a lot
of guys will do that.

1:00:07.353 --> 1:00:08.511
- He's still working his ass off

1:00:08.596 --> 1:00:09.929
- Like, yeah, he's still
working his ass off.

1:00:10.023 --> 1:00:12.357
Like, not a lot of guys
would have, like, sacrificed,

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:15.352
would have, like, been,
as vulnerable as you've been.

1:00:15.436 --> 1:00:16.528
So I want to commend you
for that

1:00:16.613 --> 1:00:17.854
because that's
pretty impressive to, like,

1:00:17.947 --> 1:00:20.282
take it back to square one
and do this, do that,

1:00:20.441 --> 1:00:21.783
do that, just to get
your wife back, man.

1:00:21.942 --> 1:00:23.785
That's very, very,
very, very impressive.

1:00:23.870 --> 1:00:25.195
So I was more shocked
about that,

1:00:25.279 --> 1:00:26.613
as opposed to them breaking up.

1:00:26.697 --> 1:00:28.123
<i>- Ryan, do you think
it's gonna be tough for him</i>

1:00:28.207 --> 1:00:30.375
with Rachel's friends
and family?

1:00:30.534 --> 1:00:33.119
- Um, I think at one point--
I think when they did break up,

1:00:33.204 --> 1:00:35.213
I don't think friends or family
were the reason

1:00:35.373 --> 1:00:36.632
for the breakup at all.

1:00:36.716 --> 1:00:41.803
But I do think once she was
in that single category,

1:00:41.962 --> 1:00:44.047
that there were people
that liked her being

1:00:44.131 --> 1:00:46.975
in the single category for--
For both of their enjoyment.

1:00:47.060 --> 1:00:48.644
<i>- Right.</i>
[laughter]

1:00:48.728 --> 1:00:50.646
- I'm not gonna say her name,
but Gil's wife.

1:00:50.730 --> 1:00:52.731
[laughter]

1:00:52.890 --> 1:00:54.066
- Oh, you didn't say that.

1:00:54.150 --> 1:00:56.226
- No, Myrla and Rachel are
really good friends.

1:00:56.319 --> 1:00:59.229
And I think Myrla really liked
Rachel being single.

1:00:59.313 --> 1:01:00.322
- Yep.

1:01:00.481 --> 1:01:01.481
- It was something
that we talked about.

1:01:01.574 --> 1:01:03.325
[laughter]
- Oh, did he say, "yep"?

1:01:03.484 --> 1:01:05.068
- Is that gonna be
a big roadblock, Johnny,

1:01:05.161 --> 1:01:06.495
do you think?

1:01:06.654 --> 1:01:08.330
- Nah, I'm friends with Myrla,
I'm friends with Rachel,

1:01:08.414 --> 1:01:09.748
I'm friends with Jose.

1:01:09.907 --> 1:01:12.084
I was there from the beginning
when they--they broke up

1:01:12.168 --> 1:01:14.753
to when they got back together
and where they are now.

1:01:14.837 --> 1:01:17.414
Um, I like to think
I had a part in it

1:01:17.507 --> 1:01:19.925
'cause I kind of knew
what Rachel was looking for,

1:01:20.009 --> 1:01:22.177
and every now and then,
I'd drop little hints to Jose

1:01:22.261 --> 1:01:24.421
saying, like, "If you did
a little more of this,

1:01:24.505 --> 1:01:25.588
who knows?"

1:01:25.682 --> 1:01:27.766
Because what Rachel was
really looking for

1:01:27.850 --> 1:01:31.353
was just for Jose to stop
hanging out at home so much.

1:01:31.437 --> 1:01:33.096
And you can't do that
with Rachel

1:01:33.180 --> 1:01:34.272
because Rachel likes
to have fun.

1:01:34.357 --> 1:01:35.691
She likes to have experiences.

1:01:35.775 --> 1:01:38.860
It doesn't matter, like,
if it costs $500 for the date

1:01:38.945 --> 1:01:40.270
or it costs $5 for a date.

1:01:40.363 --> 1:01:44.107
She just wants to do things
and have experiences.

1:01:44.191 --> 1:01:46.192
- You know, guys, this season,
there was a real bromance

1:01:46.277 --> 1:01:49.037
that was cooking,
so I want you to watch this.

1:01:49.196 --> 1:01:51.206
- Jose, my man.
- Oh, what's up, brother?

1:01:51.290 --> 1:01:52.115
What's going on?
You all right, man?

1:01:52.208 --> 1:01:53.283
- Yeah, I'm good.

1:01:53.376 --> 1:01:55.210
Jose and I immediately had
this connection.

1:01:55.294 --> 1:01:56.286
Brah, I brought you here

1:01:56.370 --> 1:01:57.546
because you're, like,
Mr. Romance.

1:01:57.630 --> 1:01:59.038
- Oh, man.

1:01:59.123 --> 1:02:00.790
- If I was a chick,
I'd be into Jose.

1:02:00.875 --> 1:02:01.708
<i>All right.</i>

1:02:01.792 --> 1:02:03.710
<i>- ♪ I give you my mustang ♪</i>

1:02:03.794 --> 1:02:05.637
<i>- That was too much there.</i>
- He's gonna be my guy.

1:02:05.722 --> 1:02:06.972
- Yo, baby, you all right?
- Yeah.

1:02:07.131 --> 1:02:08.223
<i>- ♪ I gave you my mustang ♪</i>

1:02:08.307 --> 1:02:09.808
- Me and Johnny, you know,
we already have

1:02:09.892 --> 1:02:11.217
somewhat of a bromance
going on, all right?

1:02:11.310 --> 1:02:12.719
Both: Bro.
<i>Great dude.</i>

1:02:12.803 --> 1:02:14.312
- God, Johnny's my boy, man.

1:02:14.397 --> 1:02:15.731
My boy, Johnny.

1:02:15.815 --> 1:02:16.982
- He's my boy, Johnny.
He's my boy.

1:02:17.141 --> 1:02:18.224
That's good stuff, man.

1:02:18.309 --> 1:02:19.317
That's good stuff. I like that.

1:02:19.477 --> 1:02:21.987
- He's hot and heavy,
like, immediately.

1:02:22.071 --> 1:02:22.988
Like, I felt
like I was dating him.

1:02:23.147 --> 1:02:24.239
That's what I'm going for.

1:02:24.323 --> 1:02:25.407
Which one says, like,
"After this dinner,

1:02:25.491 --> 1:02:27.576
let's get romantic"?
<i>- Johnny, come on!</i>

1:02:27.735 --> 1:02:29.244
I think they both do, man.
- They both do?

1:02:29.328 --> 1:02:31.237
- Hey, it's all--it's all
right here, man.

1:02:31.322 --> 1:02:33.239
Whatever your heart says, bro.
Boom.

1:02:33.332 --> 1:02:34.407
- I need to learn that from you.

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:35.917
- Dude, I'm--I'm here for it.

1:02:36.002 --> 1:02:37.243
Any support you need, man.

1:02:37.328 --> 1:02:38.503
- And I'm here for you too.

1:02:38.588 --> 1:02:40.663
If you every run into anything
with your wife,

1:02:40.748 --> 1:02:42.340
we can just get away
and grab a couple beers

1:02:42.425 --> 1:02:43.500
and talk about it.

1:02:43.584 --> 1:02:45.168
<i>I'm trying to, like,
hit on him, man.</i>

1:02:45.252 --> 1:02:47.095
Jose's vibrance is
like sunshine.

1:02:47.254 --> 1:02:50.840
I hope my bromance
with Jose is forever.

1:02:50.933 --> 1:02:53.351
<i>- ♪ It's all for you, baby,
everything I do ♪</i>

1:02:53.436 --> 1:02:56.021
- [laughs]
I'm sorry, that's so funny.

1:02:56.105 --> 1:02:57.773
- Yo.
- Hearts.

1:02:57.857 --> 1:02:59.015
- Yo, I love you, man.
- I like it.

1:02:59.108 --> 1:03:00.183
- I love you.

1:03:00.267 --> 1:03:02.861
- Jose, talk to me
about this bromance

1:03:02.945 --> 1:03:04.780
and how you feel about Johnny.

1:03:04.939 --> 1:03:06.689
- You know, we just kinda
started clicking.

1:03:06.783 --> 1:03:10.035
And I was there for support
mechanism, vice versa.

1:03:10.194 --> 1:03:12.195
And that's how we did it.

1:03:12.279 --> 1:03:15.290
- Jose's the kind of guy
that he enters a room,

1:03:15.449 --> 1:03:16.958
and he says
"what's up" to everybody.

1:03:17.043 --> 1:03:18.284
Because he's
genuinely interested

1:03:18.369 --> 1:03:19.461
in getting to know everyone,

1:03:19.545 --> 1:03:21.129
introducing who he is.

1:03:21.288 --> 1:03:24.382
He's just this, like,
ball of light.

1:03:24.467 --> 1:03:26.218
And people--like, me,

1:03:26.302 --> 1:03:28.053
I'm just, like, drawn
to the light.

1:03:28.212 --> 1:03:30.138
Like--like a moth, almost.

1:03:30.223 --> 1:03:33.216
And I wanted
part of that sunshine.

1:03:33.300 --> 1:03:35.718
- Do you feel a sense
of protectiveness, Jose?

1:03:35.812 --> 1:03:36.886
<i>Over Johnny?</i>

1:03:36.971 --> 1:03:37.979
- Um, I definitely felt that,
you know,

1:03:38.138 --> 1:03:40.139
throughout the course
of the season,

1:03:40.224 --> 1:03:41.650
there was a lot going on
in his marriage.

1:03:41.734 --> 1:03:43.226
And, yeah,
I definitely felt that,

1:03:43.310 --> 1:03:47.480
hey, I was already that much
further into the relationship

1:03:47.573 --> 1:03:49.324
with where I was with Rachel.

1:03:49.408 --> 1:03:51.568
Why not help him out
and pay it forward

1:03:51.652 --> 1:03:53.653
and be that support mechanism?
So I would say yes.

1:03:53.737 --> 1:03:55.071
- Listen, I want
to tell all you guys,

1:03:55.164 --> 1:03:56.748
thank you for joining me

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:58.917
<i>and speaking so openly
and honestly</i>

1:03:59.076 --> 1:04:00.493
<i>about your experiences.</i>

1:04:00.578 --> 1:04:02.912
I wish you all the best as you
move forward in your lives.

1:04:02.997 --> 1:04:04.163
- Thanks, Kevin.
- Thanks, Kevin.

1:04:04.248 --> 1:04:05.006
- Thanks, Kevin.
- Thank you very much, Kevin.

1:04:09.086 --> 1:04:10.587
- You know, we usually have
couples come out together

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:11.588
regardless of how difficult
their marriage may been,

1:04:11.681 --> 1:04:13.515
but, um, tonight,

1:04:13.599 --> 1:04:15.517
<i>Michaela does not want
to share the stage with Zack.</i>

1:04:15.676 --> 1:04:17.936
<i>So we will talk
to Michaela first.</i>

1:04:18.095 --> 1:04:19.020
<i>Michaela, how you doing?</i>

1:04:19.179 --> 1:04:21.598
- I'm doing good, Kevin.
How are you?

1:04:21.691 --> 1:04:23.600
<i>- Are things that bad
between you and Zack</i>

1:04:23.693 --> 1:04:26.269
<i>that you can't be on the stage
at the same time?</i>

1:04:26.353 --> 1:04:29.439
