00:05.133 --> 00:07.852
<i>I know when to hold 'em</i>

00:08.013 --> 00:10.163
<i>Know when to fold 'em</i>

00:10.333 --> 00:12.130
<i>Know when to walk away</i>

00:12.293 --> 00:14.648
<i>But don 't know when to shut up</i>

00:16.533 --> 00:17.807
Read them and weep.

00:19.773 --> 00:22.128
This is the best day of my life.

00:22.293 --> 00:25.251
Wait, even better than the day
you met the Van Patten family?

00:25.413 --> 00:28.132
Hey, guys.
I remember the best day of my life.

00:28.293 --> 00:31.888
It was when I did
the wild thing for the first time.

00:34.573 --> 00:36.609
<i>I cut out of high school
to go to Soul Train.</i>

00:36.773 --> 00:39.606
The next thing I knew,
me and this honey was knocking boots...

00:39.773 --> 00:42.287
<i>...behind the Soul Train
Scrabble board.</i>

00:44.613 --> 00:46.012
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:46.173 --> 00:48.482
You mean you cut high school
in Akron, Ohio...

00:48.653 --> 00:50.644
<i>...to go to Soul Train,
which tapes in L. A?</i>

00:51.213 --> 00:53.932
Hey, hey.
High school was boring, okay?

00:54.133 --> 00:56.044
Yeah, we believe that one.

00:56.613 --> 00:58.569
Yo, man,
I remember my first time.

00:58.733 --> 01:01.201
Right before I came out here
from Philly.

01:01.813 --> 01:05.965
Miss X gave me an unforgettable
going-away present.

01:06.173 --> 01:09.085
- Miss X.
- What was it?

01:13.133 --> 01:16.603
A key chain, Carlton.
What do you think, man?

01:16.773 --> 01:18.764
All I'm saying is
she was very special...

01:18.933 --> 01:22.562
...and this true mack here
was solid gold.

01:23.093 --> 01:24.765
Man, I remember my first time.

01:24.933 --> 01:27.447
It was everything
a young man could dream of.

01:27.613 --> 01:30.002
And it only cost me 35 bucks.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.843
But, of course,
things were cheaper then.

01:34.013 --> 01:36.368
That's very touching, Jazz.

01:36.573 --> 01:40.122
Carlton, you've been mighty quiet
over there about this here subject.

01:40.693 --> 01:42.684
Maybe he ain't got nothing
to talk about.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.206
Lockjaw.

01:44.613 --> 01:46.569
I thought we were here to play poker.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.367
I think he's more used
to playing solitaire.

01:49.573 --> 01:50.847
Solitaire!

01:54.213 --> 01:55.532
I guess y'all don't know.

01:55.693 --> 01:59.049
The only problem this stallion has
is keeping the names with the faces...

01:59.213 --> 02:00.646
...if you know what I'm saying.

02:00.813 --> 02:03.008
You know, Carlton,
tell them about the time.

02:03.173 --> 02:06.927
- Tell them about the time.
- Not that it's anybody's business...

02:07.093 --> 02:09.401
...but my first time
will be a loving expression...

02:09.573 --> 02:12.531
...of my commitment
to the girl of my dreams.

02:13.053 --> 02:15.521
That's beautiful, Carlton.

02:15.693 --> 02:17.923
I call. Check it out.

02:18.093 --> 02:21.244
Three kings and a virgin.

<i>If I had a hammer</i>

03:42.373 --> 03:43.601
Hey, I do.

03:44.973 --> 03:46.122
Hey, Will.

03:46.293 --> 03:49.330
- Hey, what you doing here?
- I'm here to sign up for the reception.

03:49.493 --> 03:51.802
The dean of the business school's
a Princeton alum.

03:51.973 --> 03:55.886
- You know what that means.
- You'll be kissing more butt than Arsenio.

03:56.453 --> 03:59.365
Look, Dean Morgan
could be my ticket into Princeton.

03:59.533 --> 04:01.524
Kissing up is a small price to pay.

04:01.693 --> 04:05.368
Well, you know what?
Just try not to embarrass yourself again.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.492
What's that supposed to mean?

04:07.893 --> 04:10.566
Last night, Carlton.
I mean, this innocence thing.

04:10.733 --> 04:13.531
In high school, that was cute.
But come on, you're a man now.

04:13.693 --> 04:15.012
Start lying.

04:16.373 --> 04:19.649
I have nothing to be embarrassed about.
I'm waiting for Miss Right.

04:20.173 --> 04:22.323
Carlton, please,
forget about Miss Right.

04:22.493 --> 04:24.802
Go for Miss Right Now.

04:25.773 --> 04:28.731
Will, I don't wanna settle
for just anyone.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.327
When I was a kid,
I used to sit in my tree house...

04:31.493 --> 04:34.132
...thinking for hours
about my dream girl.

04:34.293 --> 04:36.045
I can see her now.

04:37.493 --> 04:39.643
She's got beautiful brown eyes...

04:39.813 --> 04:42.566
...and a smile that lights up a room.

04:46.133 --> 04:49.091
- Carl... Carlton.
- She'll be a great dresser.

04:49.253 --> 04:55.089
Sophisticated.
Beautiful long, dark hair.

04:56.013 --> 04:57.571
- Carlton...
- Let me finish, Will.

04:57.733 --> 04:59.132
She'll love everything I love.

04:59.293 --> 05:03.605
Money, lvy League schools
and America.

05:03.773 --> 05:06.162
<i>Excuse me.
Can I pay for this Business Week now?</i>

05:06.333 --> 05:09.848
The Princeton game is about to start.
I don't wanna miss the national anthem.

05:11.173 --> 05:13.528
Hey, lady, we were talking.

05:16.293 --> 05:19.444
Look, just a second.
I'll be right with you, all right?

05:20.733 --> 05:24.328
- Carlton, man, it's her.
- You think?

05:24.533 --> 05:28.082
Come on, man, baby is all that.
Go on, step to her and ask her out.

05:30.053 --> 05:33.966
- So you're a Princeton fan?
- Not really.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.886
But my favorite singer
is performing the national anthem.

05:37.053 --> 05:39.283
- Who's that?
- Tom Jones.

05:48.333 --> 05:51.086
Stupid, ask her out.

05:51.253 --> 05:53.847
My name's...

05:54.013 --> 05:56.049
Carlton.

05:56.973 --> 05:58.406
Carlton.

05:58.573 --> 05:59.847
Joann.

06:00.013 --> 06:01.731
There's a TV in the student union.

06:01.893 --> 06:04.487
Maybe we could watch
Tom Jones together.

06:04.653 --> 06:06.848
That sounds really nice, Carlton.

06:09.373 --> 06:10.647
Hey, good catch, Carlton.

06:10.813 --> 06:12.405
That girl's a...

06:12.853 --> 06:15.890
That girl's a damn thief.
She stole that magazine. Hey!

06:16.853 --> 06:19.970
Bob, Bob. Bob, calm down.

06:20.133 --> 06:23.330
Bob, judges don't cry.

06:24.213 --> 06:26.681
Bob, this is just an investigation.

06:26.893 --> 06:29.612
Everything's gonna work out fine.
Trust me.

06:29.813 --> 06:32.691
Okay, bye. Yeah. Bye, bye.

06:34.253 --> 06:37.245
- He's dead.
- What's going on, Uncle Phil?

06:37.413 --> 06:40.325
That ethics committee is digging up
dirt on every judge in town.

06:40.493 --> 06:43.530
It's a witch-hunt, man. A witch-hunt.

06:43.693 --> 06:45.411
Goodness. Clumsy me.

06:46.973 --> 06:49.726
Philip, I thought
you were getting the car.

06:49.893 --> 06:53.363
- What's going on?
- That committee nailed another judge.

06:53.533 --> 06:55.842
I sure am glad we don't have
anything to hide.

06:56.013 --> 06:57.651
Will?

06:58.333 --> 07:01.370
Hey, look. I found that Chevette.

07:01.533 --> 07:03.888
The body was already
in the trunk too.

07:05.533 --> 07:07.888
Honey, come on,
we're gonna be late for the party.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.647
I am serious, Will.
You stay out of trouble.

07:10.813 --> 07:13.805
The slightest indiscretion
could cost me my job.

07:16.373 --> 07:19.046
G, what is up with you today, man?

07:19.493 --> 07:21.927
I mean, you're seeming
all jumpy at anything.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.402
Jumpy? No, not me.

07:24.573 --> 07:27.610
- Come on, G, you can...
- Stop persecuting me!

07:29.173 --> 07:31.448
I've done nothing, I tell you. Nothing.

07:33.653 --> 07:36.565
You just can't get good help
these days.

07:46.653 --> 07:49.929
That was the most romantic afternoon
I've ever had.

07:50.093 --> 07:52.766
I knew you'd love
the Tom Jones Museum.

07:52.933 --> 07:55.527
I'm sorry we didn't make it
to the Hall of Sideburns.

07:57.053 --> 07:58.964
Here we are.

07:59.133 --> 08:00.771
Do you live in this hotel?

08:00.933 --> 08:02.810
Oh, just until I find a new apartment.

08:03.013 --> 08:06.289
You could come live at our house.
My little sister is almost 15.

08:06.453 --> 08:08.808
It's time she moved out on her own.

08:10.053 --> 08:13.250
I needed to laugh today. Thank you.

08:13.893 --> 08:16.487
Well, I don't want this to end.

08:16.653 --> 08:18.723
It doesn't have to.

08:22.013 --> 08:23.924
Will you marry me?

08:26.253 --> 08:29.404
You are too adorable for words.

08:30.693 --> 08:32.570
Can I give you a kiss goodbye?

08:32.773 --> 08:34.331
Yes.

08:36.732 --> 08:38.610
Tomorrow morning.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.609
Well, what time should I come back?

09:09.853 --> 09:12.208
Just toast and coffee
this morning, Geoffrey.

09:12.373 --> 09:13.852
Geoffrey's not here, Hilary.

09:14.533 --> 09:16.444
Can he do that?

09:17.933 --> 09:20.322
He was so upset,
I gave him the morning off.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.802
I better go check
to see how he's doing.

09:23.653 --> 09:26.326
Great, so what am I supposed
to do about breakfast?

09:26.973 --> 09:30.443
Oh, here's a crazy idea, Hil.
How about you get it yourself?

09:31.573 --> 09:33.165
Fine.

09:38.093 --> 09:41.642
Bel-Air Hotel? Get me Room Service.

09:54.693 --> 09:56.923
I was up all night
worried sick about you.

09:57.093 --> 10:00.085
Where have you been?
And how come you didn't call me?

10:00.253 --> 10:02.972
Oh, my God, that's my mom's finger.
Get it off my hand.

10:05.413 --> 10:08.007
Pinch me, Will. I'm in love.

10:08.173 --> 10:10.403
I finally found
the woman of my dreams.

10:10.573 --> 10:12.643
And I did it.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.566
The big it.

10:16.453 --> 10:18.762
You mean you and Joann...

10:20.133 --> 10:21.771
...closed the deal?

10:22.453 --> 10:23.932
What are you guys talking about?

10:24.093 --> 10:26.129
Business, Ash.
Here, have some breakfast.

10:26.733 --> 10:31.124
So who put the offer on the table?

10:31.293 --> 10:36.413
She did. And the terms
were so attractive, I jumped on h...

10:36.573 --> 10:38.052
It.

10:38.973 --> 10:40.804
I jumped on it.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.851
And don't worry...

10:44.013 --> 10:47.210
...I protected my investment.

10:50.213 --> 10:53.250
Come on, come on.
Tell me everything, tell me everything.

10:58.733 --> 11:02.521
- What was that all about?
- Carlton lost his virginity.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.772
I'll see y'all later, all right?

11:09.933 --> 11:12.322
Hold on a minute.
Geoffrey has something to tell us.

11:13.013 --> 11:14.731
Hurry up, G. I'm late for work, man.

11:14.893 --> 11:17.327
I have a confession.

11:17.493 --> 11:21.645
Something so shameful, I had hoped
it could remain buried forever.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.166
Oh, I think I got a minute or two
for this one.

11:26.213 --> 11:30.286
I hope this doesn't have anything to do
with the ethics committee investigation.

11:30.453 --> 11:32.728
I'm afraid it does, sir.

11:32.933 --> 11:36.687
I beg your forgiveness
for bringing this pox upon your house.

11:36.853 --> 11:39.526
That's all right,
just don't take another morning off.

11:41.733 --> 11:43.564
Okay, Geoffrey, let's have it.

11:44.413 --> 11:48.691
I'm too ashamed to talk about it.
It's better if I show you.

11:51.093 --> 11:53.323
You did a porno movie?

11:58.413 --> 12:02.406
<i>Montreal,
site of the 1976 Olympics...</i>

12:02.573 --> 12:05.531
<i>... where some athletes become
heroes to their countries...</i>

12:05.693 --> 12:09.732
<i>... and where one man
became the shame of a nation.</i>

12:12.693 --> 12:15.969
<i>Geoffrey Butler, a long-distance runner
representing Great Britain...</i>

12:16.133 --> 12:19.170
<i>... was descended from
a long line of running Butlers.</i>

12:20.533 --> 12:23.764
<i>The hopes of a nation were
on this promising runner's shoulders.</i>

12:24.773 --> 12:28.527
<i>Alas, his best was simply
not good enough.</i>

12:28.693 --> 12:32.368
<i>Halfway through the race,
young Geoffrey Butler hit the wall.</i>

12:34.573 --> 12:37.212
<i>But unfortunately,
he would not accept his defeat.</i>

12:37.373 --> 12:41.366
<i>In this amazing footage shot
by Japanese tourist, Hashi Takashi...</i>

12:41.533 --> 12:45.082
<i>... Geoffrey Butler's unthinkable
actions were captured.</i>

13:01.053 --> 13:03.362
<i>Geoffrey Butler's false victory
was short-lived.</i>

13:04.733 --> 13:07.452
<i>The Takashi footage was released
almost immediately...</i>

13:07.613 --> 13:09.922
<i>... and the public was outraged.</i>

13:16.533 --> 13:20.003
<i>Geoffrey Butler dropped from sight,
never to be seen again.</i>

13:22.813 --> 13:27.762
<i>To his countrymen,
he is the shame of a nation.</i>

13:31.973 --> 13:37.206
That's the shameful secret
I have kept inside for 17 years.

13:45.293 --> 13:50.048
Hey, hey. Hey, G, man.
Hey, we ain't laughing at you, man.

13:50.213 --> 13:52.329
I guess we kind of are.

13:54.173 --> 13:56.448
Hey, G, why don't you
run into the kitchen...

13:56.613 --> 13:58.331
...and get me something.

13:58.493 --> 14:01.132
Or better yet, take a cab.

14:02.893 --> 14:04.531
Sensitive lot, aren't you?

14:04.693 --> 14:08.322
Oh, Geoffrey, the committee won't care
about any of this.

14:08.493 --> 14:09.972
- They won't?
- Of course not.

14:10.133 --> 14:12.124
You're a servant. Get me some cake.

14:14.213 --> 14:17.011
Geoffrey, what you did
was not a crime.

14:17.173 --> 14:19.892
It was stupid.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.802
So you mean I'm not gonna cause you
any embarrassment or scandals?

14:23.973 --> 14:25.565
No, no.

14:25.733 --> 14:28.293
Oh, man. Hey, G, hold on.

14:28.453 --> 14:30.728
You mean,
that's why you came to America?

14:30.893 --> 14:32.963
That's right, Master William.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.164
When did you get your green card?

14:36.013 --> 14:38.368
Green card? What green card?

14:49.173 --> 14:51.209
Welcome to the ULA
Business Reception.

14:52.573 --> 14:54.086
Weenie?

14:56.373 --> 14:58.443
You are what you eat, buddy.

15:00.973 --> 15:03.009
Hey, there he is, ladies.

15:03.173 --> 15:05.926
- The love machine. Okay, one at a time.
- Will.

15:06.093 --> 15:09.210
Okay, two at a time
if you think you're ready, baby.

15:09.373 --> 15:12.490
Come on, Will, it's hard enough for me
to think about anything else.

15:12.653 --> 15:15.690
Oh, man, I understand.
I remember my first time.

15:15.853 --> 15:18.413
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She gave you a key chain.

15:22.653 --> 15:23.927
There's Dean Morgan.

15:24.093 --> 15:26.732
Oh, I can't just walk right up to him.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.726
Haven't you learned anything
from your experience last night?

15:30.133 --> 15:32.089
You want me to sleep with him?

15:34.133 --> 15:36.647
Carlton, I'm saying
when you want something, go for it.

15:36.813 --> 15:39.964
Now, he's over there.
Just walk over and introduce yourself.

15:44.253 --> 15:46.005
Excuse me, Dean Morgan?

15:46.173 --> 15:48.641
Carlton Banks, class of '97.

15:48.853 --> 15:51.811
I read your paper
on the rise and fall of IBM.

15:51.973 --> 15:54.851
I call it the feel-good
financial analysis of the year.

15:55.453 --> 15:58.047
Let the butt-kissing begin.

15:59.213 --> 16:00.931
Yeah, Banks, Banks.

16:01.093 --> 16:04.881
Yes, you're the chap
who wants to transfer to Princeton.

16:05.413 --> 16:07.085
That's my alma mater, you know.

16:07.253 --> 16:10.609
<i>Really? Well, quelle surprise.</i>

16:11.573 --> 16:15.566
Do you know what it takes to be
accepted into Princeton, Mr. Banks?

16:16.453 --> 16:18.683
Inspiration.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.128
And one phone call from me.

16:24.893 --> 16:26.645
Oh, this must be fate.

16:26.813 --> 16:29.043
I had my inspiration yesterday.

16:29.213 --> 16:32.523
I found a woman who makes me believe
that anything is possible.

16:32.693 --> 16:35.491
Well, I feel the same way
about Mrs. Morgan.

16:35.693 --> 16:37.411
Oh, here she is now.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.046
Sweetheart.

16:43.973 --> 16:47.329
Carlton Banks,
I'd like you to meet my wife, Joann.

16:49.693 --> 16:53.971
Hey, it is great to see you two
together again.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.407
You've met my wife?

16:55.573 --> 16:59.009
I mean, it is great to see you two
together again.

16:59.173 --> 17:01.448
Do I know you?

17:01.613 --> 17:03.490
Well, see...

17:03.653 --> 17:07.531
I'm the manager of this place,
and there's a phone call for you.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.843
Well, who is it?

17:10.012 --> 17:11.412
It's your uncle.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.962
My only uncle died three years ago.

17:14.173 --> 17:17.722
Then you should take the call because
it's probably really long-distance.

17:19.292 --> 17:20.964
Excuse me for a minute.

17:21.133 --> 17:23.886
I'll leave you two
to get better acquainted.

17:25.133 --> 17:27.442
I don't think that's possible.

17:30.093 --> 17:31.924
Why didn't you tell me
you were married?

17:32.093 --> 17:33.890
It's not that simple.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.602
You're telling me. I mean,
this will make it very hard for us.

17:40.933 --> 17:44.482
Carlton, there is no us.
My husband and I are separated...

17:44.653 --> 17:47.372
...but he called this morning
and we're working things out.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.967
- But yesterday...
- No, I was upset.

17:51.173 --> 17:53.482
And you were so cute.

17:54.093 --> 17:56.129
Well, you made me feel better.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.930
Look, I'm not proud of myself.

18:02.893 --> 18:04.645
I love you.

18:05.213 --> 18:07.169
Oh, Carlton.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.210
It was just one night.

18:10.813 --> 18:13.964
I've been waiting my whole life
for that one night.

18:15.133 --> 18:17.249
I'm so sorry.

18:21.373 --> 18:23.728
So what happens now?

18:24.493 --> 18:26.290
We say goodbye.

18:33.013 --> 18:35.402
Hey, look, Carlton, man.
I'm s... I didn't...

19:04.413 --> 19:06.973
You have to go through this
every time you come up here?

19:07.133 --> 19:09.044
No, I take the ladder.

19:17.133 --> 19:19.363
She used me, Will.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.763
Of all the students
in all the universities...

19:21.933 --> 19:24.208
...in all the world,
she had to sleep with me.

19:24.773 --> 19:26.843
I feel lower than dirt.

19:27.053 --> 19:29.772
That would be what, rocks?

19:30.853 --> 19:32.525
Yeah, I feel like rocks.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.002
Really dirty rocks.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.166
You were right, Will.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.528
There's no girl of my dreams.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.766
Hey, Carlton, check it out.

19:41.933 --> 19:45.289
How about we go down and
we discuss this on solid ground, huh?

19:45.453 --> 19:47.364
I'll buy you some rocky road, baby.

19:47.933 --> 19:49.446
No.

19:50.093 --> 19:51.811
I'm never coming down.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.202
Carlton, you're gonna have
to eventually come down.

19:56.373 --> 19:58.807
What happens when you gotta go
to the bathroom?

19:58.973 --> 20:01.123
Down the hall,
third door on your right.

20:02.933 --> 20:04.525
I'm so stupid.

20:04.693 --> 20:07.412
I'm a stupid, dirty rock.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.845
Carlton, man...

20:15.733 --> 20:17.405
...I've been thinking.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.209
Maybe if I didn't play you so much...

20:20.373 --> 20:22.568
...about being a virgin...

20:22.733 --> 20:25.531
...maybe you would've took things
a little slower.

20:25.693 --> 20:29.003
And you would've realized
that Joann wasn't "Miss Right."

20:30.773 --> 20:34.652
Maybe if me and Miss X
had taken things a little slower...

20:34.813 --> 20:37.964
...maybe we'd be a little better off
than we are right now.

20:40.093 --> 20:44.006
Is the almighty Will
admitting he was wrong?

20:44.853 --> 20:46.844
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

20:47.053 --> 20:48.884
Of course, you know that.

20:52.253 --> 20:55.006
Look, if you don't mind,
I really wanna be alone right now.

20:56.373 --> 20:58.364
All right, all right.

21:00.253 --> 21:03.689
Hey, you mind
if I use the ladder this time?

21:03.853 --> 21:06.447
- Do whatever you want.
- All right.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.086
You don't hate me, do you?

21:16.213 --> 21:17.965
No.

21:21.533 --> 21:24.252
It's a nice tree house
you got here, man.

21:24.413 --> 21:27.086
At least you didn't outgrow
your furniture, huh?

21:44.973 --> 21:46.531
Oh, you know what?

21:46.693 --> 21:50.606
I'll never forget my first time, man.
It was right before I went back to...

21:51.653 --> 21:53.769
- I remember that time.
- You remember that time?

21:53.933 --> 21:55.525
- I remember that time.
- I was there.

21:55.693 --> 21:58.332
You was there? I remember that time.

21:58.493 --> 22:00.449
I bet she remember it too.

22:00.613 --> 22:01.887
Okay, hold it.

22:02.053 --> 22:03.725
I mess my line up.

22:05.333 --> 22:07.324
That's next year's Emmy right there.
