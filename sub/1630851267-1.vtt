00:59.009 --> 01:02.884
ON APRIL 26, 1986, REACTOR NO. 4
OF THE CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

01:02.967 --> 01:05.217
SUFFERED A CATASTROPHIC EXPLOSION,

01:05.300 --> 01:09.925
CAUSING ONE OF THE LARGEST MAN-MADE
DISASTERS IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.

01:10.009 --> 01:15.842
THIS FILM IS INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS.

01:15.967 --> 01:22.675
THE FILM'S CHARACTERS AND THEIR
LIFE STORIES ARE FICTIONAL.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.509
-Thank you.
-I'll get you the change.

01:49.592 --> 01:51.009
-No, keep it.
-Thank you.

01:52.509 --> 01:54.592
-Come with me.
-I'm busy.

01:54.675 --> 01:58.092
-Some firemen came in. Pick one.
-This is not a dating agency.

01:58.175 --> 01:59.509
You need a man.

01:59.592 --> 02:02.009
-No, I don't.
-You do, more than anyone.

02:12.009 --> 02:13.259
There they are.

02:19.967 --> 02:21.175
I have to go home.

02:21.259 --> 02:23.759
But there's a huge line
of customers waiting outside.

02:28.842 --> 02:32.217
-I'm sorry, I have to go.
-Girls, are you on strike or something?

02:33.092 --> 02:34.092
Come on in.

02:34.675 --> 02:36.092
-Where do I sit?
-Over there.

02:58.092 --> 02:59.300
Hello, Alex.

03:00.800 --> 03:01.800
Hello, Olga.

03:02.842 --> 03:04.467
Have you two met before?

03:08.509 --> 03:09.509
More than ten years ago.

03:12.717 --> 03:14.800
Just don't cut both my ears off, okay?

03:15.925 --> 03:16.759
One will do.

03:25.759 --> 03:27.384
I thought you were in Kiev.

03:29.092 --> 03:30.925
And I thought you were in Kiev, too.

03:33.717 --> 03:36.259
-You haven't changed.
-Liar.

04:04.884 --> 04:05.884
ENTRANCE

04:09.384 --> 04:10.217
Olga…

04:11.759 --> 04:13.717
Come ride with me, for old times' sake.

04:15.175 --> 04:16.509
Just like that?

04:16.592 --> 04:19.467
I could send a formal request,
but it might take until winter.

04:20.759 --> 04:24.050
-Come back in three weeks for a trim.
-Olga, the bus is coming.

04:46.259 --> 04:47.967
Move over, granny.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.092
Dressed up like dollar prostitutes.

04:53.175 --> 04:55.009
That's exactly what we are.

04:56.092 --> 04:57.175
Jesus.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.884
Close your legs, you're not at work.

05:27.009 --> 05:30.925
What's your problem?
Most women would kill for a man like that.

05:37.425 --> 05:38.884
Open the door!

05:42.134 --> 05:44.050
Sorry about that, everyone.

05:45.092 --> 05:46.342
Olga.

05:47.550 --> 05:50.592
Come with me or these
passengers will be stuck here all day.

05:54.050 --> 05:56.134
Miss, you're holding us up.

06:03.884 --> 06:05.884
-Bye, everyone.
-Good riddance.

06:31.675 --> 06:33.134
Well, what do you want?

06:35.259 --> 06:36.342
Nothing.

06:48.009 --> 06:49.300
I want to hug you.

06:55.009 --> 06:55.925
Go on then.

07:26.509 --> 07:27.925
Like a couple of pensioners.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.300
Hi, Olga.

07:32.134 --> 07:33.092
Hi, Alex.

07:40.009 --> 07:42.300
Come on, where do you want to go?

07:43.134 --> 07:46.134
You pulled me off the bus,
so let's hear your suggestions.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.634
Let's go to a restaurant?
Or how about we head into Kiev?

07:52.925 --> 07:56.884
Remember when we had no money,
we shared one ice cream between us?

07:58.467 --> 08:02.134
-Got it. We need an ice cream.
-Two ice creams.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.884
Excuse me, I'm in a terrible rush.

08:12.967 --> 08:16.092
-How many?
-Two. Nice hair, by the way.

08:16.175 --> 08:18.342
ICE CREAM

08:18.425 --> 08:20.134
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

08:25.092 --> 08:26.925
Let's go for a ride on the Ferris wheel?

08:27.009 --> 08:29.009
It won't be open until May Day.

08:29.092 --> 08:32.967
My buddies from the local fire station
did the safety inspection on it.

08:33.050 --> 08:35.967
We can get a private test ride.

08:36.759 --> 08:39.967
-You're just as crazy as when you were 20.
-Who, me? Not at all.

09:31.759 --> 09:33.550
This is far enough. Stop here.

09:38.509 --> 09:39.967
Thanks for the ride.

10:01.092 --> 10:02.842
It was a nice evening, thank you.

10:03.717 --> 10:05.467
What about the cake we bought?

10:07.759 --> 10:09.634
Pulling out your nuclear weapon?

10:10.175 --> 10:12.009
Atomic power to the masses.

10:14.050 --> 10:15.134
I'll pass.

10:24.842 --> 10:27.300
Olga! Wait.

10:28.467 --> 10:29.925
Alex, some other time, okay?

10:31.884 --> 10:33.592
Greetings, fellas! What's the occasion?

10:34.509 --> 10:36.467
Celebrating Soviet technical prowess.

10:37.384 --> 10:39.467
You got a husband in there or something?

10:39.550 --> 10:40.925
No, why?

10:45.467 --> 10:47.050
I promise, no funny business.

10:47.134 --> 10:49.050
I just don't want to say goodbye yet.

10:51.175 --> 10:53.217
I haven't had such a good time in ages.

10:54.467 --> 10:57.092
But you have
a different life now, and so do I.

10:57.967 --> 11:00.425
We can see each other
at the hair salon sometimes.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.675
Olga, my hair grows too slowly.

11:04.467 --> 11:05.300
Bye.

11:19.550 --> 11:21.717
I'm home. How's it going?

11:23.342 --> 11:24.634
I don't like this school.

11:25.592 --> 11:27.175
You'll make friends soon.

11:27.259 --> 11:29.342
They're all scientists' kids,

11:29.425 --> 11:30.509
little smartasses.

11:31.509 --> 11:34.425
Olga?

11:35.259 --> 11:37.550
Olga, I forgot to give you the cake.

11:38.634 --> 11:40.467
-Olga?
-Stop shouting and go away.

11:40.550 --> 11:42.884
If you're ashamed
of your apartment, I live in a dorm.

11:42.967 --> 11:43.884
Go away.

11:51.759 --> 11:53.092
This is my son, Alex.

11:53.175 --> 11:54.342
Alex, this is uncle Alexey.

11:54.425 --> 11:55.925
Please be acquainted.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.259
Come in.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.050
Are you sure this is a good time?

12:02.134 --> 12:03.092
Come in.

12:07.217 --> 12:09.134
-Howdy, namesake.
-Hello.

12:11.675 --> 12:14.134
You two boys chat here
while I go and change.

12:18.009 --> 12:18.884
Who are you?

12:21.300 --> 12:26.009
Who am I? I'm… a sun keeper.

12:26.092 --> 12:27.259
How's that?

12:27.342 --> 12:28.675
Well, for 200,000 years,

12:28.759 --> 12:30.884
people ran around naked
with sticks and stones,

12:30.967 --> 12:33.217
and then we built
our own sun, and I look after it.

12:33.300 --> 12:36.050
I see. Everyone here works at the reactor.

12:36.134 --> 12:38.509
But only the best
work in the fire service.

12:40.384 --> 12:43.717
-But that's not working at the reactor.
-Ever heard of fire inspections?

12:43.800 --> 12:45.884
I've been
over every inch of all four reactors,

12:45.967 --> 12:47.759
and fixed lots of problems.

12:50.550 --> 12:53.384
-What do you have in here?
-Photos of our neighbors.

12:55.134 --> 12:57.300
These ones I know.

12:58.050 --> 12:59.842
But who's this? Is he from Kazakhstan?

13:00.717 --> 13:02.759
That's Jackie Chan, he's from Hong Kong.

13:02.842 --> 13:04.509
He's even tougher than Bruce Lee.

13:06.175 --> 13:09.592
-You're into filmmaking?
-This camera isn't good for that.

13:09.675 --> 13:11.259
It was my grandpa's.

13:15.842 --> 13:17.592
You boys got to know each other?

13:21.967 --> 13:23.342
Can I have a word with you?

13:33.342 --> 13:34.342
How old is he?

13:35.009 --> 13:35.842
He's ten.

13:38.134 --> 13:39.300
Whose is he?

13:41.134 --> 13:42.300
He's mine.

14:12.509 --> 14:13.842
Why didn't you tell me?

14:18.009 --> 14:20.425
How could I tell you
if I didn't even know where you were?

14:28.425 --> 14:31.134
-How's the cake?
-It conforms to state standards.

14:33.092 --> 14:34.592
I'll have a slice, too, then.

14:50.009 --> 14:51.425
Should we tell him?

14:54.300 --> 14:56.217
No need to tell him anything.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.342
Eat your cake.

15:24.509 --> 15:25.550
Right.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.592
What date is tomorrow?
The 12th? I have a day off.

15:28.675 --> 15:30.550
We're all going to Kiev for the day.

15:30.634 --> 15:33.134
I'll be here at 9:00 a.m.,
and I'm bringing presents.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.134
And then we'll have dinner
all together at home.

15:38.342 --> 15:39.634
All right?

15:43.800 --> 15:46.092
-Bye.
-I'm working tomorrow.

15:47.134 --> 15:48.675
Can't you get a day off?

15:52.675 --> 15:54.592
I guess I can switch with Marina.

15:55.175 --> 15:56.217
With Marina…

15:57.550 --> 15:59.634
Perfect. It's a date then.

16:01.925 --> 16:03.384
See you at 9:00 a.m. Sharp.

16:04.259 --> 16:05.717
I'll see myself out.

16:06.342 --> 16:07.217
Bye, Alex.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.217
TWO WEEKS LATER

16:40.092 --> 16:42.050
What can I say, my dear friends.

16:45.467 --> 16:47.884
It is with a heavy heart that I leave you.

16:47.967 --> 16:49.342
I gave you everything I have.

16:50.884 --> 16:56.759
My youth, wisdom, health, beauty,
and my hope for a better future.

16:57.925 --> 16:59.967
-Attention!
-As you were.

17:00.050 --> 17:01.342
You still owe me ten rubles.

17:01.425 --> 17:03.634
A materialist like you
can't be trusted with money.

17:03.717 --> 17:06.759
I'd give it back,
but you'll spend it on a soldering iron.

17:11.009 --> 17:12.592
What will you do without me?

17:13.175 --> 17:15.259
We'll finally put things in order.

17:15.342 --> 17:18.675
We know the drill, Comrade Colonel.
First breakfast, then lunch, then dinner.

17:19.467 --> 17:22.384
It's a solid foundation
for everything else,

17:22.467 --> 17:23.884
unlike your flimsy structure.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.925
Well, guys, keep your hoses dry.

17:39.467 --> 17:40.884
Go ahead, I'm ready.

17:54.925 --> 17:56.425
Do it!

18:10.259 --> 18:11.425
Alex!

18:15.384 --> 18:17.092
Come here, you!

18:49.384 --> 18:51.300
You have no respect for your elders.

18:53.259 --> 18:54.384
Is this Valery?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.842
Yep, my baby brother.

18:56.925 --> 18:59.717
-He's got a PhD, works at the reactor.
-Sergey, cut it out.

19:01.759 --> 19:03.009
Nice to meet you, Alexey.

19:03.634 --> 19:04.759
Likewise.

19:08.967 --> 19:10.092
Here it is.

19:11.717 --> 19:14.509
-Where's the box?
-What box? It's second-hand.

19:15.384 --> 19:17.717
You always need
to keep hold of the packaging.

19:17.800 --> 19:18.884
Let's see.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.217
Here, 500.

19:23.217 --> 19:25.467
-Count it.
-I'll take your word for it.

19:26.842 --> 19:29.050
Here's the camera.
In a box, as it should be.

19:29.842 --> 19:32.342
-I gave it a good cleaning.
-Much appreciated.

19:32.425 --> 19:34.467
And here's the manual.

19:38.675 --> 19:41.759
-Here's a bag.
-Handy.

19:44.925 --> 19:48.425
You're a good firefighter.
You should've stayed on.

19:48.509 --> 19:51.717
I'm just fed up wandering
around corridors checking stuff.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.634
That's part of the job. What do you want?

19:53.717 --> 19:55.592
I want to see Alla Pugacheva in concert.

19:57.175 --> 20:00.634
-She'll come here one day.
-So sit here and wait for her then.

20:00.717 --> 20:03.134
Valery, come
and join us in the dormitory later.

20:03.217 --> 20:06.175
I'm having a farewell party.
It'll be fun. See you then.

20:07.717 --> 20:09.384
See you later, Sergey.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.217
Are you coming or not?

20:41.967 --> 20:45.175
-But this is not Chanel.
-I'm not the Czechoslovakian ambassador.

20:53.842 --> 20:55.675
Bring it back in 24 hours.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.925
-But you said two days.
-And you said Chanel.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.009
You're breaking my heart.

21:10.217 --> 21:12.967
THE PARTY PLANS, WE MAKE IT HAPPEN

21:17.300 --> 21:19.259
WALL OF HONOR

21:39.842 --> 21:45.842
CHERNOBYL NPP

22:38.509 --> 22:40.634
Alex!

22:46.925 --> 22:49.009
-Hey.
-Hi.

22:52.217 --> 22:54.467
I brought you a present. Here.

22:54.550 --> 22:57.259
-What is it?
-A proper film camera.

22:58.384 --> 23:00.300
-No way. Really?
-Yes way, silly.

23:01.134 --> 23:02.384
It's a Lomo.

23:03.134 --> 23:05.842
-How did you get it?
-With a bit of perseverance.

23:06.467 --> 23:07.384
Wow.

23:08.592 --> 23:09.550
Thank you.

23:10.592 --> 23:12.175
Mom and I were waiting for you.

23:14.717 --> 23:17.550
Sorry. I got caught up with work.

23:20.759 --> 23:21.717
And here's the manual.

23:23.467 --> 23:24.592
Here.

23:27.009 --> 23:28.467
What should I tell Mom?

23:35.092 --> 23:37.217
Just tell her
that Father Christmas came early.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.384
See you later.

24:22.884 --> 24:24.550
I remember fire at the third reactor.

24:24.634 --> 24:27.800
We were all sweating like pigs,
could hardly keep hold of our hoses.

24:27.884 --> 24:31.384
Well, Alex stripped down
to his briefs, put his sunglasses on,

24:31.467 --> 24:34.175
and started wetting
the dry wall with buckets of water.

24:34.259 --> 24:35.259
A rainbow above him.

24:36.675 --> 24:40.509
All for Elena from HR,
who was watching him from her window.

24:41.634 --> 24:43.092
You're making stuff up.

24:43.175 --> 24:45.800
The whole brigade got a bonus,
and Alex was demoted to captain.

24:49.175 --> 24:50.967
Alex, I envy you, in a good way.

24:53.050 --> 24:55.592
I envy your freedom
and your willful heart.

24:57.800 --> 25:01.259
You're fearless, you do
as you please, and you answer to nobody.

25:01.967 --> 25:04.300
Well, keep your hose dry, buddy.

25:05.092 --> 25:06.509
-Hurrah!
-Hurrah!

25:08.050 --> 25:09.384
Thanks, Sergey.

25:21.342 --> 25:23.342
-Slow down, Alex.
-I'll be fine.

25:31.300 --> 25:32.717
Was that a made-up story?

25:37.675 --> 25:39.134
I'll be right back.

25:53.467 --> 25:55.884
-Why aren't you eating?
-I'll eat later.

25:58.884 --> 26:01.759
-Stop filming me.
-Stop stopping me.

26:05.259 --> 26:06.842
You'll have to give the camera back.

26:06.925 --> 26:08.550
But, Mom, it's a gift.

26:11.509 --> 26:12.675
I'll get it.

26:16.134 --> 26:17.467
It's Father Christmas!

26:18.342 --> 26:20.884
Alex! What's up?

26:24.050 --> 26:28.050
Damn it, Alex, look at you!

26:28.134 --> 26:30.800
What a little man? Just look at you.

26:30.884 --> 26:32.717
I just can't…

26:33.717 --> 26:34.592
Are you drunk?

26:36.675 --> 26:38.259
I'm drunk with love.

26:40.634 --> 26:41.925
Go play outside.

26:46.342 --> 26:49.259
Mom, can Uncle Alexey stay for dinner?

26:49.342 --> 26:51.759
That's none of your business. Go outside.

26:53.134 --> 26:54.134
Not fair.

27:00.509 --> 27:02.384
May I come in?

27:05.300 --> 27:07.134
Fried potatoes!

27:36.717 --> 27:37.925
Olga, please, I'm sorry.

27:39.634 --> 27:42.467
I got very sick, so sick…

27:44.259 --> 27:45.967
I was at death's door.

27:47.175 --> 27:48.884
Did some nurse save you?

27:57.675 --> 27:59.092
I'm moving to Kiev.

28:00.050 --> 28:01.842
I can't take it here anymore.

28:01.925 --> 28:04.717
I'm a top expert,
and I have nothing to do here.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.134
-Come with me.
-Stop it.

28:07.134 --> 28:08.050
Olga…

28:09.217 --> 28:10.342
come with me.

28:12.259 --> 28:15.800
I'll buy Alex a water pistol,
and we'll put fires out together.

28:17.634 --> 28:20.134
We were waiting
for you that day. I made dinner.

28:25.050 --> 28:26.592
I lied to my colleagues.

28:28.134 --> 28:29.800
I said I don't want to work here,

28:31.050 --> 28:32.259
that I want to leave.

28:32.342 --> 28:33.425
But the truth is…

28:34.967 --> 28:36.050
I just want to be with you.

28:38.634 --> 28:40.800
I don't want to hear any of it.

28:40.884 --> 28:44.342
No. I made up my mind. Really.

28:46.675 --> 28:48.800
I want a family with you.

28:53.050 --> 28:54.759
It's not going to work between us.

28:55.675 --> 28:56.675
Go on your own.

28:58.050 --> 28:59.759
Stop talking nonsense.

29:02.425 --> 29:03.675
Let's go together.

29:04.384 --> 29:07.967
We'll rent a place for a while,
and then apply to get our own apartment.

29:09.467 --> 29:11.175
We're not going anywhere with you.

29:12.134 --> 29:13.259
Leave us alone.

29:15.342 --> 29:17.592
Are you telling me to abandon Alex?

29:19.175 --> 29:21.509
We've been fine without you all this time.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.009
Listen, I'm really going to leave,

30:03.800 --> 30:04.759
and that'll be it.

30:06.550 --> 30:07.384
Forever.

30:10.592 --> 30:13.259
Just make sure
this time you leave for good.

30:26.092 --> 30:26.925
Fine.

30:28.134 --> 30:29.634
Good luck with your life.

30:37.717 --> 30:43.300
Leave.

31:10.550 --> 31:13.342
This is the best spot!
We can see everything from here!

31:24.717 --> 31:26.092
Let's get closer!

31:30.967 --> 31:32.592
Get the camera.

31:44.217 --> 31:46.717
It's too dark
for your camera to record anything.

31:58.092 --> 32:01.509
Our folks will kill us when they find out
we lied about going night fishing.

32:02.092 --> 32:03.384
How would they find out?

32:04.134 --> 32:05.425
We go every week.

32:07.967 --> 32:10.259
-How is it, Alex?
-We need to get closer.

32:34.384 --> 32:35.842
Let's get out of here.

32:38.550 --> 32:39.550
Shoot.

33:03.634 --> 33:05.009
Wait for me!

33:12.717 --> 33:14.967
Wait for me! Damn it!

33:17.800 --> 33:19.259
Wait for me!

33:24.884 --> 33:26.342
Wait!

33:53.175 --> 33:54.467
It's no use.

33:58.634 --> 34:01.925
-Why are you all up at 5:00 a.m.?
-They took all our men away.

34:02.009 --> 34:04.800
-And where were you? Out boozing?
-What happened?

34:04.884 --> 34:08.092
-There's a fire at the station.
-And they disconnected the phones.

34:10.259 --> 34:13.550
Damn it. Just when I got
a transfer out of here…

35:37.842 --> 35:40.175
Stop!

35:42.925 --> 35:45.509
Guys, I need a lift. I'm a fireman.

35:45.592 --> 35:46.884
Got a spare uniform for me?

35:59.050 --> 36:00.842
Hey, brother, is that the reactor?

36:01.467 --> 36:03.634
The pride and joy of the Soviet Union.

36:03.717 --> 36:06.717
Are you from around here?
Do you know why the forest has gone brown?

37:01.842 --> 37:04.925
-Move it!
-Go!

37:08.342 --> 37:10.384
Sir, I need to join my team!

37:10.467 --> 37:11.884
-Are you local?
-Yes, sir.

37:11.967 --> 37:13.842
I think your guys
are over on the other side.

37:13.925 --> 37:14.884
Come on!

37:16.884 --> 37:20.634
Get one more hose over there! Hurry!

37:30.425 --> 37:31.509
Tigran?

37:31.592 --> 37:33.550
Pour the water here!

37:33.634 --> 37:34.467
Tigran?

37:37.092 --> 37:38.509
Tigran?

37:38.592 --> 37:41.384
Tigran… where are our guys?

37:42.342 --> 37:44.009
They're over there.

37:45.509 --> 37:48.384
We were here first. The fire's over there.

37:52.009 --> 37:53.800
More water!

37:54.759 --> 37:56.592
Why are you not with the others?

37:56.675 --> 37:59.759
They told me to go up on the roof.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.425
The light was something unreal.

38:01.509 --> 38:05.509
I looked right into it.
It's unreal, like it's alive.

38:07.675 --> 38:09.009
You're not making any sense.

38:10.467 --> 38:12.092
The reactor exploded.

38:15.634 --> 38:17.925
Are you crazy? How could it explode?

38:37.717 --> 38:39.259
Tigran.

38:42.759 --> 38:44.675
Hang on, buddy.

38:47.050 --> 38:50.259
Over here! Hurry!

38:53.675 --> 38:56.592
-We have a severe case!
-Over here!

39:06.634 --> 39:08.509
Iodine thyroid block, now!

39:31.967 --> 39:35.050
-Careful.
-And lift.

39:35.134 --> 39:36.967
Into the ambulance, quick!

39:51.967 --> 39:53.217
Yuri!

39:55.050 --> 39:56.092
Get down here!

40:20.092 --> 40:23.134
Hang on, buddy.

40:23.842 --> 40:24.884
Lie still.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.175
PRIPYAT

40:31.342 --> 40:34.967
Don't get up. Help's on its way.

40:35.050 --> 40:37.800
-Yuri, get down here!
-Sergey!

40:38.634 --> 40:41.009
Alex, we've got to go up.

40:41.675 --> 40:43.675
Yuri's still on the roof.
Let's go get him.

40:47.300 --> 40:50.842
Hey, give me your breather.

41:13.300 --> 41:14.175
Sergey, you okay?

41:15.967 --> 41:18.259
Up there, the bitumen's on fire.

41:24.050 --> 41:26.300
Stay here. I'll be back in a minute.

41:58.967 --> 42:01.675
Yuri! Where are you? Yuri!

42:12.384 --> 42:14.884
Yuri. Get up.

42:17.884 --> 42:19.342
My face is all burned, right?

42:24.134 --> 42:27.175
Get up. Come on, get up!

42:29.675 --> 42:35.009
I got you. Now let's get out
of here. Come on. Let's go.

42:41.717 --> 42:43.175
Come on, get up.

43:06.050 --> 43:07.509
Come on.

43:07.592 --> 43:10.092
Sergey, you okay?

43:12.134 --> 43:14.634
I'm fine.

43:15.425 --> 43:16.342
You two go.

43:41.384 --> 43:43.884
Medic! Now!

44:05.425 --> 44:11.550
Sergey, I'm here. Come on, get up.

44:11.634 --> 44:15.050
Breathe, Sergey, breathe!

44:17.675 --> 44:19.925
Over here! Hurry!

44:24.134 --> 44:27.259
Boys, we have orders
to extract all the severe cases!

44:27.342 --> 44:28.550
Who's been vomiting?

44:29.717 --> 44:32.342
We picked men up from the third entrance--

44:32.425 --> 44:34.509
Load them in! You get in.

44:34.592 --> 44:37.300
Third entrance. Lots of them.

44:38.300 --> 44:40.675
I have to get them to hospital.

44:40.759 --> 44:43.009
Luda, hurry up.

44:43.092 --> 44:47.800
Luda, hurry up, I have to get them
to hospital. There are more, a lot more.

44:48.509 --> 44:50.634
-Take me with you.
-No, we're full!

44:50.717 --> 44:53.342
-They are my guys.
-There's no room!

44:53.425 --> 44:55.717
Please take me with you.

44:56.300 --> 44:58.759
I have my orders,
only severe cases. Let's go!

44:58.842 --> 45:01.175
-Need to get them to the hospital--
-Start the engine!

45:01.259 --> 45:03.050
Take me with you.

45:04.342 --> 45:05.759
Start the engine!

45:16.842 --> 45:18.717
-Can you drive? Let's go!
-Yes.

45:21.884 --> 45:23.342
-But--
-Move over!

45:49.967 --> 45:51.134
He's not breathing.

45:53.384 --> 45:55.009
Keep going! Don't stop!

46:00.259 --> 46:01.717
Everything's completely swollen up.

46:06.592 --> 46:07.967
Hold his head straight.

46:22.467 --> 46:23.800
Keep it steady!

46:47.925 --> 46:49.300
How is he?

46:51.092 --> 46:52.259
He's breathing.

46:54.092 --> 46:56.134
Go. Go!

47:03.509 --> 47:04.925
Careful!

47:11.509 --> 47:12.759
Get up.

47:22.800 --> 47:24.425
Put him in ward three!

47:28.550 --> 47:30.384
-Where to?
-Ward three is full.

47:38.467 --> 47:39.925
Don't just stand there. Move on.

47:50.342 --> 47:51.925
Kristina, get supplies ready.

47:52.009 --> 47:53.884
-Give this one a shot.
-Take your clothes off.

47:57.050 --> 47:58.800
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

48:33.384 --> 48:35.175
Kristina, diazepam.

48:35.259 --> 48:38.134
-What's that?
-A sedative to calm you down.

48:38.217 --> 48:40.925
-Put him in ward two.
-It's full.

48:41.009 --> 48:42.717
-Ward four then.
-No space there, either.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.634
There's one now,
Shinkarenko didn't make it.

48:45.634 --> 48:47.092
They just took him out.

49:04.300 --> 49:05.342
This way.

49:09.384 --> 49:10.634
Hurry up with the sheets.

49:12.134 --> 49:13.675
Go, I'll finish here.

49:14.550 --> 49:15.675
Lie down.

49:50.134 --> 49:53.425
Alexey, wake up.

49:56.675 --> 49:57.884
Alexey, wake up.

49:58.634 --> 49:59.634
Alexey?

50:00.384 --> 50:02.217
Get up. Are you Alexey Karpushin?

50:05.092 --> 50:05.925
Yes.

50:06.550 --> 50:07.925
How long was I asleep?

50:08.009 --> 50:09.967
Quite a while.
They overdid it with the sedative.

50:14.300 --> 50:15.384
Do you feel nauseous?

50:18.134 --> 50:20.175
-I don't think so.
-Are you feeling okay?

50:23.342 --> 50:24.175
Yes.

50:32.050 --> 50:33.884
Good. Very well then.

50:35.175 --> 50:37.925
Alexey, my name is Dina,
I'm a radiologist from Kiev.

50:38.009 --> 50:40.717
We came here to see you.
They'll bring you new clothes.

50:40.800 --> 50:43.425
I'll wait in the corridor
while you get dressed.

50:56.217 --> 50:57.842
-Nikolai?
-Go away.

50:58.842 --> 50:59.759
Go away!

51:01.509 --> 51:03.925
Nikolai!

51:04.884 --> 51:06.175
Nikolai!

51:11.134 --> 51:13.967
-Go away, go home!
-Please step away from the window.

51:14.717 --> 51:16.175
You could get us in trouble.

51:17.634 --> 51:19.634
Alexey Prihodko?

51:22.967 --> 51:25.050
-Why can't they come in?
-You're contaminated.

51:25.134 --> 51:26.384
What are we contaminated with?

51:30.384 --> 51:32.800
Radiation. You all
react differently to it.

51:32.884 --> 51:34.884
Some die after five minutes of exposure.

51:34.967 --> 51:37.050
Some are fine after five hours.

51:38.050 --> 51:39.800
You got lucky, you only got 14 rem.

51:48.009 --> 51:50.050
All the contaminated clothes
go into the basement.

51:50.134 --> 51:53.759
All of you who just arrived,
leave your clothes by the entrance!

51:55.384 --> 51:57.884
-Here's Karpushin.
-Hold on a minute.

51:59.342 --> 52:00.717
Are you Alexey Karpushin?

52:01.425 --> 52:02.550
Yes, hello.

52:02.634 --> 52:05.550
-From the reactor fire service?
-Chief of watch, sixth brigade.

52:05.634 --> 52:08.134
-Do you know the corridors below?
-Like the back of my hand.

52:08.217 --> 52:09.717
Have you ever scuba dived?

52:10.300 --> 52:11.509
No, only snorkeled.

52:12.134 --> 52:14.800
I see. You're coming with us.

52:14.884 --> 52:17.342
Look, I left the service here
and got a transfer to Kiev.

52:20.134 --> 52:24.092
You're coming with us,
and we'll discuss your transfer later.

52:24.175 --> 52:26.342
Close the door and wait.
I'll be with you shortly.

52:28.634 --> 52:30.009
Doctor, you can stay.

52:32.259 --> 52:33.384
Yes, hello?

53:06.009 --> 53:07.384
The kids are all outdoors.

53:28.050 --> 53:30.925
Comrade Stysin, we can start now.

53:31.009 --> 53:33.509
Hello, Comrade Karpushin.
I'm Mikhail, this is Ivan.

53:33.592 --> 53:36.300
We're with a government commission
responding to the incident.

53:36.384 --> 53:38.425
Hi, Valery. Any news about Sergey?

53:38.509 --> 53:40.592
They took him to Kiev, he's in bad shape.

53:42.842 --> 53:45.717
Comrades, I apologize for
bringing you all here with no explanation.

53:45.800 --> 53:48.092
I shall explain now.
Ivan, please turn on the video.

54:02.050 --> 54:05.842
Between the third and fourth units
is the crater left by the explosion.

54:05.925 --> 54:08.342
The reactor core
is in a sub-critical condition.

54:08.425 --> 54:11.425
All these bright spots
are clumps of burning reactor fuel.

54:12.092 --> 54:14.134
Temperatures could increase to the point

54:14.217 --> 54:17.467
where it melts through the floor
of the reactor and the concrete below.

54:18.425 --> 54:22.675
The coolant water reservoirs
are directly underneath the reactor.

54:23.550 --> 54:27.384
As you know, if enough fuel
burns through and gets to the water,

54:27.467 --> 54:29.092
there will be a steam explosion…

54:29.675 --> 54:32.509
that will cause
further ejection of radioactive material.

54:35.259 --> 54:37.384
If the core reaches the reservoirs,

54:37.467 --> 54:41.467
Kiev, Moscow… and the whole
of Europe will be contaminated.

54:48.050 --> 54:50.217
So we must get the water out of there.

54:51.967 --> 54:53.884
Your departments have staff

54:53.967 --> 54:56.675
who are familiar with
the corridors beneath the reactor.

54:56.759 --> 55:00.425
Comrade Kostenko, water management.
Comrade Maksimov, electrical service.

55:00.509 --> 55:03.967
Valery Goncharuk, cooling systems,
and Comrade Karpushin, fire service.

55:04.050 --> 55:06.550
Colonel Bobylin
will be assisting with the operation.

55:12.092 --> 55:14.550
We need you
to recommend staff from your departments

55:14.634 --> 55:18.259
who know the corridors under the reactor
well enough to open the sluice gates.

55:19.550 --> 55:21.300
How do you intend to do that

55:21.384 --> 55:23.884
if the water management block
is destroyed?

55:23.967 --> 55:25.967
The control panel is under rubble.

55:27.175 --> 55:29.259
We can go through
the pipe conduit corridor

55:29.342 --> 55:31.467
and open the drainage valve manually.

55:41.259 --> 55:43.092
But it's all flooded with hot water.

55:44.675 --> 55:48.842
People will be working in diving gear,
and get diving instruction beforehand.

55:50.259 --> 55:53.550
If the servo is flooded, it'll take half
an hour to open the valve by hand.

55:53.634 --> 55:57.300
Two people working together can do it
in under eight minutes, we were assured.

55:57.384 --> 56:02.300
You want us to volunteer our own people
and send them to boil for eight minutes?

56:04.425 --> 56:07.050
The volunteers will be rewarded.

56:07.884 --> 56:12.217
We're also getting a plane ready
to take them to Switzerland for treatment

56:12.342 --> 56:15.009
in a specialist radiation clinic.

56:15.092 --> 56:16.675
The most outstanding volunteers

56:16.759 --> 56:19.009
will be awarded
private apartments in Moscow.

56:19.592 --> 56:22.717
The General Secretary
will see to it personally.

56:23.675 --> 56:24.634
Isn't that enough?

57:04.217 --> 57:06.217
Well, if the servo motor isn't flooded,

57:06.300 --> 57:08.092
can we power it up directly?

57:12.217 --> 57:15.800
You'll need the nearest junction box,
in case there are breaks in the cables.

57:16.592 --> 57:19.425
One closest to the motor is here.
I don't know how to get to it.

57:19.509 --> 57:22.134
We only go down there
once a year, with guides.

57:22.217 --> 57:23.884
Ivan, where's the map of the corridors?

57:28.717 --> 57:31.967
This is what we know about
the radiation levels down there.

57:32.050 --> 57:35.384
The levels
in the corridors on the western side

57:35.467 --> 57:37.759
are lower than in the conduit corridors,

57:38.342 --> 57:40.467
and there should be less water.

57:40.550 --> 57:42.884
There are too many unknowns.

57:42.967 --> 57:44.550
What if the servo is flooded?

57:44.634 --> 57:48.259
So, you'd rather send inexperienced
divers to work in murky water?

57:49.175 --> 57:51.009
Can you guarantee
that your plan will work?

57:53.634 --> 57:54.467
No.

57:54.550 --> 57:57.592
But everyone
who stays down there long enough

57:58.300 --> 57:59.925
is guaranteed to be exposed.

58:00.009 --> 58:01.717
We won't stay long down there.

58:01.800 --> 58:03.759
The water temperature is 56C, bearable.

58:03.842 --> 58:06.467
And we only have 100 meters to go.

58:06.550 --> 58:08.092
Give us people who can show us

58:08.175 --> 58:10.634
what valves to turn,
then they can go straight back out.

58:12.467 --> 58:14.509
It'd be safest to go via Level 7.

58:15.092 --> 58:17.884
By the time we're done
wandering around this labyrinth,

58:17.967 --> 58:23.175
the water temperature will hit 70C,
and no one will go swimming in that.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.800
Comrade Stysin,
can we go and see the pool now?

58:33.884 --> 58:36.842
Yes, of course. Let's go.

58:51.384 --> 58:52.800
Nikita, let's hear it.

58:52.884 --> 58:56.842
We stayed under for 12 minutes,
but the temperature right now is only 51C.

58:56.925 --> 58:59.009
We'll now increase it to 56C.

58:59.092 --> 59:01.717
As you were. As you can see,
we're preparing thoroughly.

59:01.800 --> 59:05.842
But without your help,
we won't know which valve to open.

59:05.925 --> 59:08.759
There are miles of pipes in murky water.

59:08.842 --> 59:10.384
We won't have a clue what to do.

59:10.467 --> 59:12.092
Have you ever dived in hot water before?

59:13.925 --> 59:15.967
We know about extreme temperatures.

59:16.050 --> 59:18.050
We're talking hot, dirty water
in a confined space,

59:18.134 --> 59:19.509
not in a clean swimming pool.

59:19.592 --> 59:21.634
Engineers aren't trained
for such conditions.

59:23.092 --> 59:25.634
We'll train them here… in the pool.

59:26.509 --> 59:28.884
You'll give your own guys
hyperthermia right here,

59:28.967 --> 59:31.009
and none of them
will even make it to the reactor.

59:34.092 --> 59:37.259
I can't order my people
to do something like this.

59:37.342 --> 59:38.425
They're not soldiers.

59:39.175 --> 59:42.300
Comrades, this is not
a question of can or can't.

59:43.717 --> 59:46.884
It is a question of do or die.

59:59.509 --> 1:00:02.759
I'm sorry, but my men
don't know those corridors well enough.

1:00:02.842 --> 1:00:05.675
No electricity in the station,
not enough people, like you said.

1:00:09.467 --> 1:00:13.134
I can't order my men to do this either.

1:00:15.509 --> 1:00:17.259
If you decide to go in at Level 7…

1:00:19.634 --> 1:00:20.717
I'll go myself.

1:00:23.092 --> 1:00:24.259
Me too.

1:00:31.925 --> 1:00:35.509
Boris… we'll go in at Level 7.

1:00:36.884 --> 1:00:39.175
We have no right
to risk these people's lives.

1:00:46.967 --> 1:00:49.800
Do we have the right
to risk the lives of people in Kiev

1:00:49.884 --> 1:00:52.384
who are getting ready
for the May Day parade?

1:00:59.592 --> 1:01:00.592
Fine.

1:01:02.259 --> 1:01:06.217
Try going in… at Level 7.

1:01:20.134 --> 1:01:22.092
Do we have
the support of the fire service?

1:01:23.884 --> 1:01:27.467
I don't work here as of yesterday.
I don't have any authority to give orders.

1:01:28.550 --> 1:01:31.592
In any case, almost
the entire local brigade is hospitalized.

1:01:34.300 --> 1:01:35.384
I won't go in there.

1:01:41.259 --> 1:01:47.259
Didn't you give an oath to protect
your country with your own life?

1:01:56.384 --> 1:01:58.800
Fine, let's decide on the route.

1:02:23.425 --> 1:02:28.050
Attention, everyone.

1:02:28.134 --> 1:02:30.675
Dear comrades,

1:02:30.759 --> 1:02:35.425
the City Council
of People's Deputies informs you that,

1:02:35.509 --> 1:02:38.009
due to an incident

1:02:38.092 --> 1:02:43.134
at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant,

1:02:43.217 --> 1:02:46.342
there is an adverse radioactive situation

1:02:46.425 --> 1:02:49.425
in the town of Pripyat.

1:02:49.509 --> 1:02:53.259
Authorities and the military

1:02:53.342 --> 1:02:58.134
are taking all necessary measures.

1:02:58.884 --> 1:03:04.675
Nonetheless, in order
to ensure safety of the townspeople,

1:03:04.759 --> 1:03:07.925
children being top priority,

1:03:08.009 --> 1:03:12.509
we need to temporarily evacuate civilians…

1:03:15.634 --> 1:03:18.217
Olga!

1:03:20.884 --> 1:03:22.300
-Olga!
-Alex got very sick.

1:03:22.967 --> 1:03:24.675
-Hey there, Jackie Chan.
-Hi.

1:03:26.842 --> 1:03:28.134
What's wrong with him?

1:03:28.217 --> 1:03:31.134
Same as with everyone.
I don't know. We have to get out of here.

1:03:33.967 --> 1:03:35.300
Have the doctors seen him?

1:03:35.884 --> 1:03:39.217
No. The hospital is packed full
of sick kids, all screaming and crying.

1:03:39.925 --> 1:03:41.592
There's talk of a wave of miscarriages.

1:03:41.675 --> 1:03:43.134
Miscarriages, understand?

1:03:43.675 --> 1:03:45.800
The police have cordoned off the hospital.

1:03:50.342 --> 1:03:52.550
Hey, how are you feeling?

1:03:53.509 --> 1:03:55.800
I saw the explosion and then a glow.

1:03:56.800 --> 1:03:58.092
Did anyone get killed?

1:03:58.175 --> 1:04:00.634
No, it was just an ordinary fire--

1:04:00.717 --> 1:04:01.842
Are you my dad?

1:04:07.259 --> 1:04:08.884
No. Why do you ask?

1:04:21.259 --> 1:04:22.717
Did Mom tell you that?

1:04:23.467 --> 1:04:26.259
We'll talk about this later.
We need to go now.

1:04:27.509 --> 1:04:28.675
Come on, get up.

1:04:28.759 --> 1:04:30.134
You're not a little kid.

1:04:30.217 --> 1:04:32.425
I'm not going anywhere.

1:04:32.509 --> 1:04:33.592
We have to go.

1:04:34.217 --> 1:04:35.342
Come on.

1:04:35.425 --> 1:04:37.217
We're never coming back here, right?

1:04:37.300 --> 1:04:39.300
Of course, we'll come back.

1:04:40.759 --> 1:04:43.134
You're lying!

1:04:43.217 --> 1:04:44.550
-Grab our bag.
-I want my camera!

1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:49.925
I'm not going anywhere! I don't want to!

1:04:50.717 --> 1:04:51.884
I'm not going!

1:05:01.675 --> 1:05:02.634
Olga, let me help.

1:05:05.550 --> 1:05:07.050
No animals allowed.

1:05:07.134 --> 1:05:10.884
-You can't take animals with you.
-But it's my dog! Dad, tell him!

1:05:11.842 --> 1:05:14.092
Sweetie, we'll come back for him later.

1:05:15.050 --> 1:05:17.259
-Give me the key.
-Don't lock him inside.

1:05:17.342 --> 1:05:19.634
-We have a sick child.
-The doctors are over there.

1:05:19.717 --> 1:05:20.842
Olga, follow me.

1:05:23.009 --> 1:05:24.342
Come.

1:05:28.550 --> 1:05:30.050
-Olga, over here.
-Alex…

1:05:37.134 --> 1:05:39.175
Olga, there's an ambulance.

1:05:43.509 --> 1:05:45.717
Sorry, it's an emergency.

1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:48.259
-My child is sick, please help.
-Let's see his throat.

1:05:50.259 --> 1:05:52.717
-Has he been vomiting?
-He vomited yesterday.

1:05:52.800 --> 1:05:56.175
Everyone with radiation sickness
must go to Hospital No. 6 in Kiev.

1:05:56.259 --> 1:05:58.259
He can't even stand. We need an ambulance.

1:05:58.342 --> 1:06:00.259
You'll have to discuss that in Kiev.

1:06:00.342 --> 1:06:01.967
He can hardly breathe!

1:06:02.050 --> 1:06:03.884
What's your name, please?

1:06:06.759 --> 1:06:08.717
Olga Savostina. My son is Alexey Savostin.

1:06:11.467 --> 1:06:13.134
-Can I talk to you?
-Hands off me.

1:06:13.217 --> 1:06:14.300
Just for a second.

1:06:14.384 --> 1:06:16.675
Hands off me.
Can't you see what's going on here?

1:06:16.759 --> 1:06:20.092
Everyone's leaving town on buses.
I don't make decisions here. Name?

1:06:21.384 --> 1:06:22.217
Alexey Savostin.

1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:23.675
Savostin.

1:06:23.759 --> 1:06:24.717
Get on the bus.

1:06:25.342 --> 1:06:26.175
Let's go.

1:07:10.717 --> 1:07:13.259
Mom, I want out of the bus.

1:07:13.842 --> 1:07:15.467
Hang in there, sweetie.

1:07:16.259 --> 1:07:19.300
-Mom…
-Everything will be fine.

1:07:26.134 --> 1:07:30.134
Oh, God, what's happening?

1:07:31.717 --> 1:07:36.259
We'll be in Kiev soon,
we'll get help there. Don't worry.

1:07:36.342 --> 1:07:37.175
Stop it.

1:07:37.925 --> 1:07:39.384
Stop promising.

1:07:40.217 --> 1:07:41.300
Who's going to help us?

1:07:41.384 --> 1:07:43.467
They're transporting us
like cattle. Stop lying!

1:07:45.467 --> 1:07:47.259
I'm not lying. I'm trying to help.

1:07:48.425 --> 1:07:51.884
-I owe you that much.
-You don't owe us anything. Nothing!

1:07:51.967 --> 1:07:55.175
Mom, why are you yelling at him?

1:07:57.967 --> 1:08:00.759
I'm sorry.

1:08:04.009 --> 1:08:05.759
I just can't take it anymore.

1:08:32.050 --> 1:08:33.759
Take this, it's almost 300 rubles.

1:08:34.425 --> 1:08:36.425
I'll arrange
the best treatment there is for Alex,

1:08:36.509 --> 1:08:38.134
but now I have to go back.

1:08:41.884 --> 1:08:44.592
Hang in there, buddy.
You'll be good as new in no time.

1:10:00.342 --> 1:10:01.175
You in charge here?

1:10:01.259 --> 1:10:03.592
This man says he wants to volunteer,

1:10:03.675 --> 1:10:05.259
something about pumping water.

1:10:05.342 --> 1:10:08.050
-Alexey Karpushin, fire service.
-I know you, I was at the meeting.

1:10:08.134 --> 1:10:09.092
I want to volunteer.

1:10:11.467 --> 1:10:12.884
Oleg, talk to Frolov for me.

1:10:15.050 --> 1:10:17.134
Thanks, Captain, we'll take it from here.

1:10:17.217 --> 1:10:20.550
You just missed them, they went off
to the third reactor to check the route.

1:10:20.634 --> 1:10:23.050
You can go with the second group

1:10:23.134 --> 1:10:24.967
if the first group fails.

1:10:25.050 --> 1:10:26.634
How can I join the first group?

1:10:27.300 --> 1:10:30.592
-Comrade Stysin calls shots here.
-I know the corridors better than anyone.

1:10:30.675 --> 1:10:33.800
All right. Wait for them here.
They'll be back in a couple of hours.

1:10:33.884 --> 1:10:35.217
Can I join them there now?

1:10:35.967 --> 1:10:37.342
They'll be back soon.

1:10:39.384 --> 1:10:41.884
-Show me the route they decided on.
-On the board.

1:10:41.967 --> 1:10:43.175
-This one?
-Yes.

1:10:43.259 --> 1:10:46.759
I can't understand these blueprints.
Do you have a fire evacuation diagram?

1:10:47.884 --> 1:10:49.050
To the left.

1:10:56.509 --> 1:10:58.175
-Like that, through Level 7?
-Yes.

1:11:00.592 --> 1:11:04.009
We can cut through here, it's closer.

1:11:05.884 --> 1:11:08.925
-Cut through reinforced concrete?
-There used to be a flight of stairs.

1:11:09.009 --> 1:11:11.842
They took it out
and covered the hole with a metal sheet.

1:11:11.925 --> 1:11:12.800
Where?

1:11:14.300 --> 1:11:15.759
-Here?
-Yes.

1:11:15.842 --> 1:11:17.175
Why didn't they mention it?

1:11:17.259 --> 1:11:20.175
They've been here since the launch,
but I saw the plant being built.

1:11:20.259 --> 1:11:22.509
Take me there,
I'll show you the shortest way.

1:11:23.759 --> 1:11:26.300
Marchenko… get us a helicopter.

1:12:44.634 --> 1:12:46.925
Comrade Stysin, there's a shorter route.

1:12:47.009 --> 1:12:47.842
Show us.

1:12:47.925 --> 1:12:49.342
-Hi, Valery.
-Hi.

1:12:56.342 --> 1:12:57.175
Here it is.

1:12:57.842 --> 1:13:01.009
We can cut through it
and shorten the route.

1:13:04.342 --> 1:13:07.550
I did the calculations already,
this route is 150 meters shorter.

1:13:08.509 --> 1:13:10.217
Why isn't this in the blueprints?

1:13:10.300 --> 1:13:12.217
The blueprints
are verified, but in reality,

1:13:12.300 --> 1:13:14.384
a lot of things were built differently

1:13:14.467 --> 1:13:15.759
to meet deadlines.

1:13:16.634 --> 1:13:17.967
Good news for us, though.

1:13:18.050 --> 1:13:21.175
Comrade Stysin,
we won't be taking the fireman with us.

1:13:21.259 --> 1:13:26.175
We appreciate the tour, but down there
in the dark, we'll need reliable people.

1:13:33.925 --> 1:13:35.592
You'll come with the first group.

1:13:39.009 --> 1:13:42.217
-Are you doing this for the reward?
-What are you doing this for?

1:13:44.509 --> 1:13:46.092
I'm doing my duty.

1:13:54.967 --> 1:13:58.050
Are you Olga Savostina?
You have a phone call from Pripyat.

1:14:15.509 --> 1:14:16.550
-Hello?
-Olga…

1:14:17.259 --> 1:14:19.675
I found you at last. How are things?

1:14:19.759 --> 1:14:23.384
I don't know. They took Alex away.
They're not telling me how he is.

1:14:23.467 --> 1:14:24.384
He'll be fine.

1:14:24.467 --> 1:14:27.009
I'm making arrangements
for the best treatment for him,

1:14:27.092 --> 1:14:29.384
and then we'll all go live by the sea.

1:14:31.009 --> 1:14:33.509
-Olga?
-I can't talk to you anymore.

1:14:33.592 --> 1:14:36.300
-Olga? Hello?
-I'm sorry, I just can't.

1:14:36.384 --> 1:14:37.759
Olga, hello?

1:14:49.634 --> 1:14:52.550
-Comrade Stysin, I have a favor to ask.
-Go ahead.

1:14:53.967 --> 1:14:55.592
My son was exposed to radiation.

1:14:56.217 --> 1:14:58.342
Can he go to Switzerland, too?

1:15:01.425 --> 1:15:02.425
Comrade Tropin.

1:15:03.509 --> 1:15:07.925
Alexey has some conditions he'd like
to discuss before going under the reactor.

1:15:09.675 --> 1:15:13.175
-What conditions?
-No conditions, just a favor to ask.

1:15:16.759 --> 1:15:19.050
My son was near
the reactor when it exploded.

1:15:20.634 --> 1:15:23.675
Would it be possible for him to go
to Switzerland for treatment, too?

1:15:24.509 --> 1:15:28.425
The passenger list will be
confirmed by the General Secretary,

1:15:28.509 --> 1:15:30.425
and only liquidators are on it.

1:15:30.509 --> 1:15:33.425
Surely, it's easier for him
to add a name to a list

1:15:33.509 --> 1:15:35.717
than to evacuate the whole of Kiev?

1:15:36.759 --> 1:15:40.800
You don't quite understand
how the bureaucratic machine works.

1:15:41.550 --> 1:15:43.717
Then can he go instead of me?

1:15:44.217 --> 1:15:47.925
And you can send me to a hospital
in Moscow or Kiev. Could that be done?

1:15:49.884 --> 1:15:52.050
I think we can arrange for that.

1:15:54.425 --> 1:15:55.800
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1:15:55.884 --> 1:15:58.009
Would you mind
showing me your credentials?

1:15:59.175 --> 1:16:00.425
So that I can be sure.

1:16:12.550 --> 1:16:13.925
I'm convinced.

1:16:16.217 --> 1:16:17.300
You should be.

1:16:27.425 --> 1:16:28.634
Here are your masks.

1:16:28.717 --> 1:16:31.300
The water shouldn't be deep,
but take them just in case.

1:16:32.217 --> 1:16:35.134
If you run into
a field of radiation, go around it.

1:16:35.217 --> 1:16:37.550
-We'll manage.
-Ivan, let's hear the drill again.

1:16:37.634 --> 1:16:39.675
You get to mark 01, cut through the floor

1:16:39.759 --> 1:16:42.259
and go along DU-1
to the junction box that powers the servo.

1:16:42.342 --> 1:16:44.134
You hook up the cable and wait.

1:16:44.217 --> 1:16:47.134
We'll power it up in exactly 20 minutes.
Let's synchronize watches.

1:16:49.925 --> 1:16:51.592
Alexey, I found out about Alex.

1:16:51.675 --> 1:16:53.925
The boy
was definitely exposed to radiation,

1:16:54.009 --> 1:16:57.509
but with treatment in Switzerland,
he should make a full recovery.

1:16:57.592 --> 1:16:58.717
Thank you.

1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:02.092
Just do what you have to do,
and we'll take care of the rest.

1:17:02.967 --> 1:17:05.467
-Time for you to go.
-Let's roll.

1:17:07.259 --> 1:17:08.800
Nikita, let's go.

1:17:42.384 --> 1:17:43.800
What force are you with?

1:17:45.050 --> 1:17:46.342
Foreign intelligence.

1:17:46.425 --> 1:17:49.550
Holy cow! Do we have
a lot of enemies out there?

1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:53.425
Your bosses are a bit harsh.

1:17:53.509 --> 1:17:55.342
They are okay. Keep hold of the reel.

1:17:56.550 --> 1:17:57.800
We're here.

1:17:59.717 --> 1:18:01.092
This is where we need to cut.

1:18:22.884 --> 1:18:23.717
How is it?

1:18:27.259 --> 1:18:28.259
Could be worse.

1:18:30.384 --> 1:18:32.384
Let's go. The stairs
are only two meters away.

1:19:22.384 --> 1:19:24.925
There can't be any steam
in the pipes after the accident.

1:19:25.009 --> 1:19:26.259
So, what's this then?

1:19:26.342 --> 1:19:29.675
Water must be getting in
somewhere from above and evaporating.

1:19:29.759 --> 1:19:31.550
The reactor is still hot as hell.

1:19:41.259 --> 1:19:43.217
Alex, let's close these valves!

1:19:43.300 --> 1:19:44.384
Okay.

1:19:46.009 --> 1:19:47.425
Nikita, go for it.

1:19:58.259 --> 1:19:59.592
Nikita, get away from there!

1:20:07.425 --> 1:20:08.509
Let's get him up.

1:20:10.259 --> 1:20:11.550
Sit him down.

1:20:18.092 --> 1:20:21.175
-You need to get out.
-I'll go on, Boris.

1:20:24.175 --> 1:20:26.259
No, wait for us here. We'll be quick.

1:20:26.884 --> 1:20:28.634
I'm fine to continue.

1:20:28.717 --> 1:20:31.967
Don't be stupid.
Wait here. We'll be back soon.

1:20:33.550 --> 1:20:35.425
Nikita, we'll be back soon.

1:20:39.467 --> 1:20:41.175
And lift.

1:21:01.925 --> 1:21:03.092
What's wrong, Valery?

1:21:07.092 --> 1:21:08.675
I'm not going any further.

1:21:39.550 --> 1:21:41.675
I'm sorry, I'm not going any further.

1:21:44.425 --> 1:21:46.342
But we can't do it without you.

1:21:46.425 --> 1:21:47.509
I can't go on.

1:21:52.050 --> 1:21:53.467
Let's talk, shall we?

1:21:57.675 --> 1:22:00.509
Get your breath back,
and then we'll have a little talk.

1:22:05.634 --> 1:22:07.675
I can't go on!

1:22:07.759 --> 1:22:10.634
My wife and kids in Kiev
are preparing to celebrate May Day,

1:22:10.717 --> 1:22:12.759
so stick your "can't go on" up your ass.

1:22:16.050 --> 1:22:17.842
-I'm sorry.
-Valery.

1:22:17.925 --> 1:22:19.800
-I'm sorry.
-You're having a panic attack.

1:22:19.884 --> 1:22:21.467
-Let go of me.
-Look me in the eyes.

1:22:21.550 --> 1:22:22.592
I said let go of me!

1:22:22.675 --> 1:22:26.759
-I'm not going!
-Look at me. Breathe with me.

1:22:26.842 --> 1:22:27.759
In and out.

1:22:27.842 --> 1:22:29.342
Come on, breathe.

1:22:30.717 --> 1:22:33.759
In and out.

1:22:34.467 --> 1:22:37.425
That's it, calm down.

1:22:42.717 --> 1:22:44.259
Do you think I'm not scared?

1:22:44.925 --> 1:22:47.884
Do you think Yuri Gagarin wasn't scared
when they shot him into space?

1:22:47.967 --> 1:22:49.842
He pissed himself inside that spacesuit.

1:22:51.967 --> 1:22:56.009
When we're done here, they'll take us
for a lap of honor around Red Square.

1:22:56.759 --> 1:22:58.800
Like they did with Korolev and Gagarin.

1:22:59.550 --> 1:23:01.384
You know how many women Gagarin had?

1:23:02.884 --> 1:23:05.300
-No.
-More than you, that's for sure.

1:23:08.675 --> 1:23:09.925
You're an idiot, Alex.

1:23:16.509 --> 1:23:18.634
Sergey died in Kiev of radiation sickness.

1:23:46.634 --> 1:23:48.925
Well, Valery,
I am not going to die just yet.

1:23:50.509 --> 1:23:55.092
I still have plans… and dreams.

1:23:57.925 --> 1:24:00.175
Do you think
I'm not scared of going in there?

1:24:12.300 --> 1:24:13.759
My legs won't move.

1:24:15.050 --> 1:24:16.592
Well, you just make them.

1:24:16.675 --> 1:24:19.300
Come on, up you go.

1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:40.134
It's like a sauna in here.

1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:07.217
-Crap!
-Is the cable in one piece?

1:25:07.300 --> 1:25:09.509
Looks like it, but the reel fell down.

1:25:15.134 --> 1:25:16.217
I feel dizzy.

1:25:16.300 --> 1:25:17.800
How many fingers am I holding up?

1:25:17.884 --> 1:25:20.009
Five. I think I might throw up.

1:25:38.175 --> 1:25:39.259
Help me out.

1:25:39.342 --> 1:25:40.634
I got you.

1:25:46.717 --> 1:25:48.467
Boris, it's scalding hot in there.

1:25:55.967 --> 1:25:57.092
You okay?

1:26:01.717 --> 1:26:02.842
We have six minutes.

1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:05.675
-Valery, get my flashlight.
-Okay.

1:26:07.634 --> 1:26:08.509
Give.

1:26:21.759 --> 1:26:23.217
There's the junction box.

1:26:28.217 --> 1:26:29.675
It's hot, but bearable.

1:26:29.759 --> 1:26:31.967
This water
makes you feel as if you're drunk.

1:26:37.342 --> 1:26:39.342
Boris, you stay here
and keep track of the time.

1:26:40.384 --> 1:26:42.384
I'll carry Valery
over to the junction box,

1:26:42.467 --> 1:26:44.217
and he'll hook the cable up.

1:26:44.967 --> 1:26:46.384
You remember the instructions?

1:26:46.925 --> 1:26:47.842
I do.

1:26:49.509 --> 1:26:50.759
Will you manage?

1:26:52.550 --> 1:26:53.384
Yes.

1:26:57.592 --> 1:26:58.467
Three minutes.

1:27:32.925 --> 1:27:34.175
Ninety seconds, Valery!

1:27:51.342 --> 1:27:53.217
Right. Disconnecting the breaker.

1:27:53.884 --> 1:27:54.800
Done.

1:27:57.217 --> 1:27:58.134
You okay?

1:27:58.925 --> 1:28:00.092
Yeah, keep at it.

1:28:05.550 --> 1:28:08.009
Connecting the cable
to the lower contacts of the breaker.

1:28:08.550 --> 1:28:09.884
One minute!

1:28:14.467 --> 1:28:15.759
One…

1:28:17.425 --> 1:28:18.675
and two.

1:28:22.092 --> 1:28:23.509
Connecting the breaker.

1:28:29.759 --> 1:28:31.175
Turning on the switch.

1:28:32.634 --> 1:28:35.175
-Thirty-two.
-I'm done, let's go back.

1:28:43.050 --> 1:28:45.050
Don't carry me, I'll walk.

1:28:48.342 --> 1:28:49.384
Come on.

1:29:14.384 --> 1:29:15.634
It worked!

1:29:16.467 --> 1:29:17.675
Holy crap!

1:29:19.300 --> 1:29:21.467
-We did it!
-Quiet.

1:29:21.550 --> 1:29:23.675
-The tester's lit up.
-Quiet. We should hear it.

1:29:27.509 --> 1:29:30.092
Yes! It worked!

1:29:30.925 --> 1:29:33.634
We did it! It worked!

1:29:34.342 --> 1:29:36.759
Comrade Colonel, it worked! We did it!

1:29:39.092 --> 1:29:40.342
We did it!

1:29:52.550 --> 1:29:55.717
It didn't work.
We'll have to open the valve by hand.

1:29:56.967 --> 1:29:58.467
Maybe we can try hotwiring it again?

1:29:58.550 --> 1:30:01.675
No, they already
powered it up. It didn't work.

1:30:01.759 --> 1:30:05.217
-Maybe the live came loose?
-That's not the problem.

1:30:05.300 --> 1:30:08.509
-Let's check the live--
-That's not the problem, Alex!

1:30:09.342 --> 1:30:11.425
We'll have to open the valve by hand.

1:30:16.467 --> 1:30:19.925
Let's go. We have to go down to the valve.

1:30:21.592 --> 1:30:23.967
-Boris…
-Let's go, guys.

1:30:24.050 --> 1:30:25.384
-Boris?
-No, Comrade Stysin.

1:30:25.467 --> 1:30:29.967
-We must get Boris out.
-It's so hot in here, Mom…

1:30:30.050 --> 1:30:31.050
Boris?

1:30:43.134 --> 1:30:44.217
Where's Nikita?

1:30:50.467 --> 1:30:52.009
Where's Nikita?

1:30:56.634 --> 1:30:58.592
-I left my flashlight. I'll go get it.
-Nikita!

1:30:58.675 --> 1:30:59.884
Be quick.

1:31:24.342 --> 1:31:25.259
Almost there.

1:31:33.884 --> 1:31:34.925
Did you hear that?

1:31:39.050 --> 1:31:39.967
Hear what?

1:31:42.884 --> 1:31:43.717
Water.

1:31:46.217 --> 1:31:47.217
Over there.

1:31:49.634 --> 1:31:51.675
Boris, take it easy.

1:31:52.759 --> 1:31:54.550
We're getting out of here.

1:31:59.175 --> 1:32:02.259
But this is the corridor
that goes straight to the valve.

1:32:03.175 --> 1:32:04.175
Let's go.

1:32:04.759 --> 1:32:06.759
Boris, wait. Boris!

1:32:07.842 --> 1:32:10.342
Wait! Boris, stop!

1:32:15.092 --> 1:32:16.092
Alex, you okay?

1:32:17.675 --> 1:32:20.550
-Go after him.
-Boris! Damn you!

1:32:20.634 --> 1:32:21.800
Boris!

1:32:24.467 --> 1:32:26.884
Boris, it's too close to the reactor!

1:32:28.300 --> 1:32:30.800
Stop! Stop right there!

1:32:32.217 --> 1:32:34.175
It's too close to the reactor, Boris!

1:32:49.467 --> 1:32:51.009
There's light ahead.

1:32:52.675 --> 1:32:55.925
-Stop! Boris!
-I see light!

1:32:57.634 --> 1:32:59.925
Guys, there's light ahead!

1:33:01.425 --> 1:33:02.884
I see light!

1:33:06.342 --> 1:33:09.634
Stop!

1:33:19.884 --> 1:33:20.759
Stop!

1:33:34.967 --> 1:33:38.050
Close the door! You'll burn to death!

1:33:56.009 --> 1:33:58.759
ENTRANCE

1:34:02.884 --> 1:34:04.217
Easy, Boris. Hang on.

1:34:04.300 --> 1:34:06.300
Alex!

1:34:08.592 --> 1:34:09.592
Alex!

1:34:11.884 --> 1:34:12.717
Quick!

1:34:15.175 --> 1:34:16.300
There's magma there.

1:34:17.134 --> 1:34:19.592
Magma. We have to get out.

1:34:22.259 --> 1:34:23.592
We've got to get out.

1:34:32.967 --> 1:34:34.425
Nikita… Where's Nikita?

1:34:35.967 --> 1:34:38.550
Get their clothes off
and get them to decontamination, now!

1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:46.009
There's magma there. Magma.

1:34:47.717 --> 1:34:49.592
Comrade Stysin…

1:34:53.342 --> 1:34:56.550
Let's go back down.
We need to open the valve.

1:34:56.634 --> 1:34:58.134
There's water in the corridors.

1:34:58.217 --> 1:35:00.884
Take it easy, Valery.
You've done your job.

1:35:00.967 --> 1:35:02.592
Call for a helicopter.

1:35:41.342 --> 1:35:42.884
How much did Boris get?

1:35:43.592 --> 1:35:45.050
Seven hundred rem. Perhaps more.

1:36:00.134 --> 1:36:03.675
They're sending liquidators
back in to carry on their work.

1:36:48.259 --> 1:36:49.300
Comrade Stysin.

1:36:59.134 --> 1:37:00.675
You'll have to come with us.

1:37:02.425 --> 1:37:04.050
Are you taking me in?

1:37:04.134 --> 1:37:05.092
Only for a talk.

1:37:05.175 --> 1:37:08.717
Just stand there, and listen quietly
while they dress you down.

1:37:12.134 --> 1:37:13.467
I won't listen quietly.

1:37:14.467 --> 1:37:16.175
Maybe your plan is better than mine.

1:37:16.259 --> 1:37:17.592
You wanna take a bunch of people

1:37:17.675 --> 1:37:19.509
and use them
to plug the hole in the reactor.

1:37:20.217 --> 1:37:23.384
We should've thought better
when they were building the damned thing,

1:37:23.467 --> 1:37:26.717
but we allowed it
to be built so that it would blow up.

1:37:28.175 --> 1:37:30.425
That's what I'm going to tell them.

1:37:31.175 --> 1:37:33.259
They can cover their asses all they want.

1:37:34.300 --> 1:37:36.467
Why don't you just mind your own business?

1:37:37.175 --> 1:37:39.384
Who are you fighting?

1:37:39.467 --> 1:37:42.050
The system? It's like radiation.

1:37:42.134 --> 1:37:46.092
Invisible, ever-present, and everlasting.

1:37:46.175 --> 1:37:47.550
Stop acting like a child.

1:37:49.967 --> 1:37:51.342
But I am a child.

1:37:53.759 --> 1:37:55.675
I'm a child of the Soviet regime.

1:38:44.175 --> 1:38:51.134
WARD NO. 2

1:38:58.217 --> 1:38:59.634
How are you feeling?

1:39:01.134 --> 1:39:03.259
-Fine.
-Get back in bed.

1:39:03.342 --> 1:39:04.425
How's Nikita?

1:39:04.509 --> 1:39:05.509
He's fine.

1:39:06.884 --> 1:39:10.175
Doctor, I'd like to have
five minutes with Alexey if that's okay.

1:39:11.467 --> 1:39:13.759
-You have five minutes.
-Thank you.

1:39:16.092 --> 1:39:17.175
Is that your mother?

1:39:18.175 --> 1:39:19.800
Why is she crying? You're alive.

1:39:21.842 --> 1:39:24.050
I'm gonna go down to open the valve.

1:39:30.884 --> 1:39:32.467
That's a suicide mission.

1:39:40.800 --> 1:39:42.425
There aren't enough volunteers.

1:39:43.384 --> 1:39:44.842
None, to be more precise.

1:39:46.134 --> 1:39:48.925
Only soldiers.
There's more than enough of them.

1:39:50.175 --> 1:39:51.550
But they're not volunteers.

1:39:52.509 --> 1:39:53.342
Yeah.

1:39:54.925 --> 1:39:56.342
They don't get much choice.

1:40:02.259 --> 1:40:03.884
Maybe they'll find another way?

1:40:04.467 --> 1:40:05.842
They can blow a hole in it…

1:40:06.550 --> 1:40:07.884
or pump the water out.

1:40:10.550 --> 1:40:12.175
Maybe they'll blow a hole in it.

1:40:13.925 --> 1:40:15.217
Maybe they won't.

1:40:18.925 --> 1:40:22.092
If whatever they do
doesn't work, it'll blow a hole in itself.

1:40:41.550 --> 1:40:44.092
Right. I'll go back to my mom.

1:41:10.342 --> 1:41:12.509
You're done. Call the next one in.

1:42:21.300 --> 1:42:22.300
Hi, Olga.

1:42:44.717 --> 1:42:46.759
Why did you leave us?

1:42:46.842 --> 1:42:48.967
Why did you leave me back then?

1:42:49.050 --> 1:42:50.259
Why?

1:43:15.759 --> 1:43:17.592
I don't know what's wrong with him.

1:43:18.342 --> 1:43:20.009
They won't let me see him.

1:43:21.509 --> 1:43:24.175
I'm cutting hair here, so stupid…

1:43:35.759 --> 1:43:38.342
Right now, you and I
are going to go and get him.

1:43:40.384 --> 1:43:42.134
We'll put him on a plane to Switzerland.

1:43:42.675 --> 1:43:44.717
He'll get proper treatment there.

1:43:51.092 --> 1:43:52.800
What? What plane?

1:43:53.759 --> 1:43:56.342
I got him a seat
on a charter flight for radiation victims.

1:43:57.884 --> 1:43:59.717
What's wrong with him? Why Switzerland?

1:43:59.800 --> 1:44:03.467
Their doctors are better than ours.
It's the best possible option for him.

1:44:06.175 --> 1:44:08.175
He's going to be fine.

1:44:10.759 --> 1:44:12.550
We just have to get him…

1:44:13.759 --> 1:44:15.300
and put him on the plane.

1:45:09.509 --> 1:45:11.425
My boy, please forgive me.

1:45:11.509 --> 1:45:13.259
They wouldn't let me see you.

1:45:13.342 --> 1:45:16.342
You got to ride
with flashing lights, just like Gorbachev.

1:45:16.967 --> 1:45:19.092
Don't be scared.
You're going to get better there.

1:45:19.175 --> 1:45:20.550
Alexey Savostin?

1:45:21.259 --> 1:45:23.217
Yes, there's our little soldier.

1:45:23.300 --> 1:45:25.217
Please give me
your little soldier's documents

1:45:25.300 --> 1:45:26.509
and say your goodbyes.

1:45:27.592 --> 1:45:30.300
Will there be any doctors
who speak Russian over there?

1:45:30.384 --> 1:45:31.467
I'll be there.

1:45:33.800 --> 1:45:35.050
I love you, sweetie.

1:45:35.759 --> 1:45:37.134
Why are you leaving me?

1:45:39.217 --> 1:45:41.342
I'm not allowed to go with you.

1:45:41.425 --> 1:45:42.384
Don't leave me, Mom!

1:45:42.967 --> 1:45:43.800
Olga…

1:45:46.050 --> 1:45:47.134
Mom!

1:46:04.967 --> 1:46:06.134
Let's go.

1:46:40.384 --> 1:46:41.259
Olga, sit down.

1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:06.300
We didn't ask for the phone number.

1:47:06.384 --> 1:47:07.384
I'll get it.

1:47:09.467 --> 1:47:11.217
We have to call him every day.

1:47:16.634 --> 1:47:18.800
You've done
everything you could. Now relax.

1:47:20.425 --> 1:47:23.050
When he gets back,
he needs you to be strong for him.

1:47:26.592 --> 1:47:27.634
You're right.

1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:30.675
Thank you.

1:47:33.342 --> 1:47:35.217
I promised to be there for you, didn't I?

1:47:54.342 --> 1:47:55.717
I feel bad for how I treated you.

1:47:56.717 --> 1:47:57.842
And I'm scared.

1:48:00.009 --> 1:48:01.550
It's me who should feel bad.

1:48:31.592 --> 1:48:32.467
Alex.

1:48:39.634 --> 1:48:40.717
Alex.

1:48:56.342 --> 1:48:57.259
Alex, no.

1:49:17.300 --> 1:49:21.884
The Soviet nation
celebrates this year's May Day,

1:49:21.967 --> 1:49:26.509
full of vigor and creative energy.

1:49:27.217 --> 1:49:30.717
Festive crowds walked along Khreschatyk,

1:49:30.800 --> 1:49:33.217
Kiev's main thoroughfare.

1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:36.884
Tens of thousands
of people took part in the parade…

1:50:12.592 --> 1:50:13.759
Alex?

1:50:19.467 --> 1:50:20.300
Alex?

1:50:30.675 --> 1:50:34.259
Olga, I'm sorry for leaving you again,
but I have to go back in there.

1:50:34.342 --> 1:50:37.759
You have the best son in the world.
And you picked the best name for him!

1:50:52.092 --> 1:50:53.634
I'm glad you volunteered.

1:50:56.050 --> 1:50:57.967
I wish I could say the same.

1:50:59.884 --> 1:51:03.509
Turns out I lied to you. We won't get
our victory lap around Red Square.

1:51:04.175 --> 1:51:05.842
You're an idiot, Alex.

1:51:08.259 --> 1:51:11.342
It's a shame Boris didn't make it
to see this historic moment.

1:51:16.134 --> 1:51:18.342
It's a good thing
Alex can't talk underwater.

1:52:18.967 --> 1:52:20.050
This way.

1:52:45.217 --> 1:52:48.634
The water's almost 60C… like they said.

1:52:49.967 --> 1:52:53.009
Valery… since nobody can hear us here…

1:52:54.967 --> 1:52:57.050
why did this thing really blow up?

1:52:58.759 --> 1:53:00.050
Because of people.

1:53:04.300 --> 1:53:05.717
Which people exactly?

1:53:10.384 --> 1:53:11.800
Does it matter?

1:53:23.467 --> 1:53:24.509
You ready? Let's go.

1:54:30.509 --> 1:54:31.509
What's the matter?

1:54:33.592 --> 1:54:36.842
I'm not scared,
my hands are just shaking like crazy.

1:54:38.175 --> 1:54:41.175
I'll open the valve myself.
I can't wait any longer, it's too hot.

1:54:41.259 --> 1:54:42.717
Wait for me.

1:54:46.134 --> 1:54:47.217
I can't.

1:57:32.842 --> 1:57:34.717
Ivan, the water's draining.

1:57:46.425 --> 1:57:48.300
The water's draining. They did it.

2:02:54.509 --> 2:02:57.717
They found him after the water drained.
Everyone thought he was dead.

2:03:03.759 --> 2:03:04.842
How do I look?

2:03:06.884 --> 2:03:08.217
Good enough.

2:03:15.717 --> 2:03:17.300
Why don't you take him to Kiev?

2:03:20.342 --> 2:03:23.717
Three hours of being rattled around
on the road won't do him any good.

2:03:25.717 --> 2:03:26.800
Listen.

2:03:30.759 --> 2:03:31.967
He's radioactive.

2:03:32.050 --> 2:03:34.925
Keep contact to a minimum.
It could be very dangerous.

2:03:45.884 --> 2:03:47.259
ISOLATION WARD - STAFF ONLY

2:04:05.509 --> 2:04:12.467
KEEP OUT

2:06:29.217 --> 2:06:33.092
THREE MONTHS LATER

2:08:58.425 --> 2:09:05.384
DEDICATED TO THE CHERNOBYL LIQUIDATORS
