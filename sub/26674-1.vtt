WEBVTT

00:17.974 --> 00:23.110
[upbeat music]

00:25.503 --> 00:27.636
[audience clapping and cheering]

00:33.555 --> 00:35.426
[shower water running]

00:38.386 --> 00:39.517
[man singing indistinctly]

00:39.561 --> 00:42.651
- [Man] Hey! Bunny!
[shower turns off]

00:47.308 --> 00:49.223
- Woman!
- [Bunny] Oh! Stop!

00:49.266 --> 00:51.529
You're not even supposed
to be here! [laughing]

00:51.573 --> 00:52.487
Carlyle!

00:52.530 --> 00:53.444
- You think this is funny?

00:53.488 --> 00:54.445
You think this is funny?

00:55.403 --> 00:56.839
You think this is funny?

00:56.882 --> 00:57.666
- [Bunny] No, don't! You're
getting everything wet!

00:57.709 --> 00:59.233
I have company coming! Stop!

00:59.276 --> 01:00.451
You got this. You started
this. You started this.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.278
- [Bunny] You did!
I'm getting you back.

01:01.322 --> 01:02.714
I'm gettin' you back--

01:02.758 --> 01:04.325
- Gettin' me back by givin'
me third degree burns?

01:04.367 --> 01:06.631
- You purposely cut the shower
off while I was still in it.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.720
- I was trying to
fix the kitchen sink.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.766
- Yeah. You know you
did that on purpose.

01:10.809 --> 01:12.333
To try to be funny.

01:12.376 --> 01:13.725
I didn't even know
you were here!

01:13.769 --> 01:16.250
Then I come out and
Geez is standin' here

01:16.293 --> 01:17.816
with his tongue
hangin' to the floor,

01:17.860 --> 01:20.384
eyes poppin' out, talkin'
about "I didn't see nothin'".

01:20.428 --> 01:22.169
- Aw, well, that
was an accident.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.127
All right, listen, I had no
idea you was gonna run out

01:24.171 --> 01:24.867
of the bathroom naked.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.173
Who walks around naked?

01:27.522 --> 01:28.262
- You do!

01:28.305 --> 01:30.438
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:31.178 --> 01:32.135
- [Bunny] Mom!

01:32.179 --> 01:33.354
- Oh...

01:33.397 --> 01:34.398
- It is not what you
think, Mrs. Charles.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.921
- Well, if it
isn't what I think,

01:35.965 --> 01:38.141
then I'll be very disappointed.

01:38.185 --> 01:40.622
Here. Here, take this
from me. Oh! Whew!

01:40.665 --> 01:42.319
See, that's why I don't
like to use my keys,

01:42.363 --> 01:45.235
'cause I know y'all be runnin'
around here, and I was right.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.280
- Stop playin'.

01:48.630 --> 01:49.848
- Oh...

01:49.892 --> 01:52.547
Boy, here. Go put on
some clothes, please.

01:52.590 --> 01:53.809
- Thank you.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.767
- Whew. Whew.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.335
You know...

01:59.336 --> 02:01.599
You two need to cut this out,
and make somethin' happen.

02:01.643 --> 02:02.905
- Oh, Mom. Don't start.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.254
- You know I'm right.

02:04.298 --> 02:05.603
That Carlyle, he's just too fine

02:05.647 --> 02:07.475
and too nice a man to not...

02:07.518 --> 02:08.431
Oh, wait a minute. Wait.

02:08.476 --> 02:09.651
He isn't gay, is he?

02:10.565 --> 02:11.348
You gay?

02:11.392 --> 02:12.480
- Mom.

02:12.523 --> 02:13.394
- What? Okay. I'm
done with that.

02:13.437 --> 02:14.830
F-For now.

02:17.789 --> 02:21.358
I'm just sayin', now you two
have knowN each other since--

02:21.402 --> 02:22.490
- [Bunny] College.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.274
- A-And yous kept
in touch after,

02:24.318 --> 02:26.450
and you've been livin' together
for six or seven months...

02:26.494 --> 02:27.277
- A year.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.496
- [Roxanne] A year!

02:28.539 --> 02:30.759
- Yeah, but to help
each other financially.

02:31.629 --> 02:32.630
- Do you argue?

02:32.674 --> 02:33.327
- No.

02:33.370 --> 02:34.328
- Is he sloppy?

02:34.371 --> 02:35.590
- No.

02:35.633 --> 02:36.765
- Is he disrespectful
when I'm not around?

02:36.808 --> 02:38.070
- Mom, come on.

02:38.114 --> 02:39.811
You know Daddy taught me
how to spot a gentleman.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.552
- Well, then what is it?

02:41.596 --> 02:43.641
Carlyle, he's, he's
leavin' in a few weeks.

02:43.685 --> 02:44.642
If somethin's gonna happen,

02:44.686 --> 02:46.644
you need to make it happen now.

02:46.688 --> 02:48.690
- Mom, it's complicated.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.474
- It's complicated.

02:50.518 --> 02:51.867
You know, you young people,

02:51.910 --> 02:53.695
y'all bring too much
to a relationship.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.827
You know why? Got
too many options.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.829
That's why I agree with
some of those other cultures

02:57.873 --> 03:00.832
when they try and find a
potential wife for the son,

03:00.876 --> 03:03.270
and a potential husband
for my daughter.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.749
- Oh, please. If
that was the case,

03:04.793 --> 03:07.404
Daddy would've had me
married off at the age of 12,

03:07.448 --> 03:10.233
with one of his
business partner's sons,
like Jack and Jill.

03:10.277 --> 03:13.628
- Honey, he's, he's just
looking out for your future.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.457
And you know, those
aristocratic families,

03:16.500 --> 03:18.502
they do it all the time.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.417
- Um, correct me if I'm wrong,

03:20.461 --> 03:22.767
but I don't remember Queen
Elizabeth, or the Kennedys

03:22.811 --> 03:24.987
being at any one of
our holiday parties.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.858
- The Springers were there.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.295
- They're from Detroit.

03:28.338 --> 03:29.774
- Yeah, but they're
very well off,

03:29.818 --> 03:31.689
and they own a linen company
that makes baby clothes

03:31.733 --> 03:33.256
out of organic cotton.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.475
- [scoffs] The way they act,

03:34.518 --> 03:35.824
you would think they
own the plantation.

03:35.867 --> 03:36.694
- Bunny. Bunny, please.

03:36.738 --> 03:37.913
- Mom, honestly.

03:37.956 --> 03:40.916
Dad picked my debutante,
my senior prom date.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.570
He's not pickin' my husband.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.659
- Look at Lavanya and Eugene.

03:44.702 --> 03:47.705
Now, she took him to
your debutante ball,

03:47.749 --> 03:49.403
and her parents picked
him as her escort,

03:49.446 --> 03:50.708
and they got married.

03:50.752 --> 03:51.753
- Yeah, well, that
was their choice.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.363
That was the family's plan.

03:53.407 --> 03:55.757
And I really never like
Eugene for Lavanya.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.803
I mean, he was nice, but
he was just too rigid.

03:58.847 --> 03:59.804
You see how that turned out.

03:59.848 --> 04:01.328
You see how that turned out.

04:01.371 --> 04:02.503
- Yeah, poor girl.

04:02.546 --> 04:03.721
- Yeah, honestly, Mom.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.070
Arranged marriages
end up in divorce

04:05.114 --> 04:07.029
just as much as
any other marriage.

04:07.072 --> 04:09.553
Now, I would like to
have Daddy's approval

04:09.597 --> 04:11.642
of whoever I end up with, but...

04:11.686 --> 04:12.861
I have the final say.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.428
- Well, I guess, I guess.

04:14.471 --> 04:15.603
I guess you're right.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.039
After all, it will
the person you spend

04:17.082 --> 04:18.649
the rest of your life with,

04:18.692 --> 04:19.998
but your father and I,

04:20.041 --> 04:22.392
we just want you to
have what we have, baby.

04:22.436 --> 04:23.915
And what better way than to help

04:23.959 --> 04:26.266
to pick out Mr.
Right? [chuckles]

04:26.962 --> 04:30.400
And because we love
our daughter so much.

04:30.444 --> 04:31.053
- I know.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.359
- Okay? [smooches]

04:33.055 --> 04:34.317
- Love you.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.579
- Now, what about
this book club?

04:35.623 --> 04:37.929
How is it? Is it like
Avon, or Tupperware?

04:37.973 --> 04:39.453
- Well, you know what?

04:39.496 --> 04:41.324
I actually, I saw these
ladies at the coffee shop,

04:41.368 --> 04:43.413
laughing, having a
really good time.

04:43.457 --> 04:46.460
And then I noticed they went
into some deep conversation.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.984
And I thought, "This
would be a really good way

04:49.027 --> 04:50.855
"to get the girls
together once a month."

04:50.899 --> 04:52.422
And we'll talk about the book,

04:52.466 --> 04:53.815
we'll talk about
our favorite parts,

04:53.858 --> 04:55.338
we'll ask questions,

04:55.382 --> 04:56.992
and then, that will
springboard into

04:57.035 --> 04:59.951
some really good conversation,
and just, good bonding.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.431
- Uh huh. And then...

05:01.475 --> 05:03.564
maybe just segue-way into some

05:03.607 --> 05:04.913
talk about men and...

05:04.956 --> 05:05.827
sex?

05:05.870 --> 05:06.654
- What doesn't?

05:06.697 --> 05:08.090
[both laughing]

05:09.483 --> 05:11.615
You know what? I need to
call and check on the shop.

05:11.659 --> 05:12.921
- Oh, no, no wait. Bunny!

05:12.964 --> 05:13.922
Bunny, unh unh.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.924
Bunny, stop! Put
that phone down.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.056
You opened that
boutique six months ago,

05:18.100 --> 05:19.884
and you haven't taken a day off.

05:19.928 --> 05:22.147
- Okay, and this was a
way to help me get my mind

05:22.191 --> 05:22.887
off the shop.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.411
I know. I know.

05:24.454 --> 05:25.890
- And you already stopped
by there once today, anyway.

05:25.934 --> 05:26.804
Didn't ya?

05:26.848 --> 05:27.936
- Well, yeah, I had to make sure

05:27.979 --> 05:29.372
they put the dresses
in the front.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.374
- You see, that's
why you have a staff.

05:31.418 --> 05:34.334
- [Both] So they can run the
shop when you're not there.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.773
[audience cheering and clapping]

05:39.600 --> 05:41.819
- Aren't you handsome?

05:41.863 --> 05:45.388
Ooh, I just love a man
in upscale sportswear.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.695
So fashionable for
men. [chuckles]

05:47.738 --> 05:49.566
You should see your
father. [chuckles]

05:49.610 --> 05:51.133
Oh, speaking of which...

05:51.176 --> 05:53.570
When Donovan gets back, he's
got a score to settle with you.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.050
- Uh...

05:55.093 --> 05:57.487
Yeah, and I gotta admit, I
got lucky that last round.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.446
18th hole, par 4?

06:00.055 --> 06:03.058
Sank that birdie, one
putt, and usually beats me.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.625
- Usually?

06:04.668 --> 06:05.843
I thought you only played
with my dad once or twice.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.018
- No, we play a
few times a month.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.542
I mean, we all frequent
the same course,

06:08.585 --> 06:09.978
so we get a few games in.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.545
- You knew that, Mom?

06:11.588 --> 06:14.156
- Oh, your father, he always
brags when he wins. [laughs]

06:14.896 --> 06:15.853
- Huh.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.639
You never told me that, Carlyle.

06:19.727 --> 06:20.728
- Well, I didn't know I
had to tell you every time

06:20.771 --> 06:22.120
I play golf with your father.

06:22.730 --> 06:25.646
- I mean, you don't, but
Dad always tells Mom.

06:25.689 --> 06:28.431
- Your father's married. He
has to tell me everything.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.607
[laughs, turns into coughing]

06:31.521 --> 06:32.653
- Mom.

06:32.696 --> 06:33.218
- [Carlylye] Mrs.
Charles, you okay?

06:33.262 --> 06:34.524
- Mom, you okay?

06:34.568 --> 06:35.743
- Yeah, I'm all
right. I'm all right.

06:35.786 --> 06:36.961
[doorbell rings] Get
the door! Get the door.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.920
You guys get the
door. I'll be fine.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.446
[intercom buzzes]
- [Carlyle] Yo.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.926
- [Voiceover] It's Rona.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.015
- [Carlyle] Rona who?

06:47.058 --> 06:48.625
- [Voiceover] Rona!

06:49.626 --> 06:52.020
- All right, you all know I
gotta go, now. [Bunny laughs]

06:52.063 --> 06:53.587
All right. You guys have fun.

06:53.630 --> 06:54.762
- [Bunny and Roxanne] All right.

06:55.676 --> 06:56.764
- Mm hm.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.027
You know you play too much.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.855
- I gotta mess with
you when you come here.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.726
- Yeah, lookin' like one
of my babies' daddys,

07:02.770 --> 07:05.120
and you gonna mess with
me at the wrong time,

07:05.163 --> 07:06.469
Tiger Hood.

07:06.513 --> 07:07.905
- [Bunny] Hey. Watch that left.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.472
She's known for that jab.

07:10.168 --> 07:12.606
- [Bunny and Rona] Kenneth
Wallace. [laughing]

07:12.954 --> 07:14.042
- Let me tell you.

07:14.085 --> 07:14.912
Kenneth Wallace
used to run around,

07:14.956 --> 07:16.610
grabbin' all the girls booties.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.046
- Yes.
- [Bunny] And then Rona and I,

07:18.089 --> 07:20.483
we didn't really know
each other that well,

07:20.527 --> 07:21.789
but we were waitin'
on fifth period.

07:21.832 --> 07:24.008
He walks by, grabs
both of our booties,

07:24.052 --> 07:25.227
at the same time.

07:25.270 --> 07:28.535
I smack him, on the
hand. And he laughs.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.145
[laughs] Remember that?
- [Rona] Mm hm.

07:30.188 --> 07:31.494
- What you do, Rona?

07:31.538 --> 07:33.061
- I knocked his butt out.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.498
- Yeah. That's when I said,
uh, "I'm hangin' with her".

07:35.542 --> 07:36.586
- That's right.

07:36.630 --> 07:37.761
- I'll remember that.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.197
- Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:39.241 --> 07:40.721
You're not stayin'
for the meetin'?

07:40.764 --> 07:42.853
- Oh, no, no. Bunny
doesn't want us boys, uh,

07:42.897 --> 07:44.246
up in this one.

07:44.289 --> 07:46.509
- No, I want to try it
out with the ladies first.

07:46.553 --> 07:47.989
- I'm thinkin', since
I read the book,

07:48.032 --> 07:49.512
she's just afraid that I
might take over the meeting.

07:49.556 --> 07:50.644
- Oh, please.

07:50.687 --> 07:51.993
- Oh, then you
learned something.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.299
- I'm still processing it.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.171
- Uh huh. Well, you
still processing

07:56.214 --> 07:57.781
not being single anymore?

07:57.825 --> 08:00.871
- Ha ha! Good one, Mrs. Charles.

08:00.915 --> 08:03.221
Anyway, Rona, me and the boys,

08:03.265 --> 08:05.615
we gotta, we gotta tee
time in about an hour.

08:05.659 --> 08:09.576
- Oh, is, um,
Monte golfing, too?

08:10.664 --> 08:11.795
- Yeah.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.623
- Mm. Maybe he can
teach me his swing.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.842
- Rona!

08:14.885 --> 08:16.757
- What? I'm just talkin'
about a little golf.

08:16.800 --> 08:17.975
- Uh, he's talkin' about golf.

08:18.019 --> 08:20.021
You sound like you
tryin' to make Mon-tay

08:20.064 --> 08:21.675
your next baby dad-day.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.981
- Ooh, I would [mumbles]
for that one. Cute.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.549
- I'm gonna slip myself out
of the middle of this one.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.942
You ladies have a good one.

08:27.985 --> 08:28.812
- You too.

08:28.856 --> 08:29.813
- Hey, ladies! [laughs]

08:29.857 --> 08:32.554
- Hi. Um, where's your dish?

08:32.599 --> 08:33.817
- [Rona] Oh!
It's pot luck.

08:33.861 --> 08:34.948
- Oh, for real?

08:34.991 --> 08:35.863
Oh, my bad, girl.

08:35.905 --> 08:37.038
You know the evite, it just said

08:37.081 --> 08:38.822
bring the date and
time. I didn't...

08:38.866 --> 08:41.563
- If you would've
scrolled, scrolled down,

08:41.607 --> 08:43.827
you would've seen that
it said "potluck",

08:43.871 --> 08:45.046
big as day.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.178
- [sighs loudly] All
right, well, next time,

08:47.222 --> 08:48.832
we gonna have it
at my place, okay?

08:48.876 --> 08:50.442
- Oh, no.

08:50.486 --> 08:51.922
No, you're not gettin' me with
that one, this time., okay?.

08:51.966 --> 08:54.359
I feel like anytime
at your apartment,

08:54.403 --> 08:56.274
you want to do something,
it's like a decoy,

08:56.318 --> 08:57.667
for tryin' to babysit.

08:57.711 --> 09:00.322
Remember last time?
Me, Lavanya, Brittany?

09:00.365 --> 09:01.889
We were supposed to
have movie night?

09:01.932 --> 09:04.152
We ended up watchin' your
kids for three hours.

09:04.195 --> 09:06.763
While you went to
supposedly get some food.

09:07.242 --> 09:09.592
- I brought back the food.

09:09.636 --> 09:13.248
- You came back with a home
platter from the corner bar.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.946
- Well, anyway, it was
Mookie's birthday party,

09:15.990 --> 09:18.340
and I know y'all booggiebutts
wasn't gonna go anyway.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.951
And my kids was good, all right?

09:20.995 --> 09:24.346
- Yeah, until little Shana
thought she was a beautician.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.871
- [laughs] My baby want
to be a cosmetologist.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.525
- Oh, that is so sweet.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.572
- Yeah, it was sweet until she
ruined Lavanya's $2000 weave.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.878
Yes. Had glue all
up in her hair.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.794
- My baby thought she was
givin' her a perm, honey. Yes!

09:37.838 --> 09:39.753
- I would've permed that hinney.

09:39.796 --> 09:40.667
- [laughs] Mom, stop.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.190
- I'm old school.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.627
- I felt bad, 'cause I was
the one who invited Lavanya.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.760
She definitely didn't
want no kids after that.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.892
- At your store opening,
she told me she loved

09:48.936 --> 09:50.459
being around my kids,

09:50.502 --> 09:53.114
and she wasn't the one who said
she didn't want to have 'em.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.899
You know that was all him.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.422
Truth come out when
you be drinkin'.

09:57.466 --> 09:59.729
- See? She's not here
to defend her husband.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.992
I'm not speakin' on this.
It's not my business.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.820
- All right. So, ladies,
what's on the menu?

10:03.864 --> 10:04.995
- Uh...

10:05.039 --> 10:07.737
Oh, I forgot the
sandwiches in the car.

10:07.781 --> 10:09.434
- Oh, no, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

10:09.478 --> 10:11.654
B-Bunny, Bunny, Bunny.
Now, you're doin' just

10:11.698 --> 10:13.700
way, way, way, way too much.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.397
I'll take care of all of this.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.355
You go, you go get
the sandwiches.

10:17.399 --> 10:20.054
- Okay. Okay. Okay, Ro, can
you help me with the trays?

10:20.097 --> 10:21.229
[Rona groans dramatically]

10:22.839 --> 10:23.971
Thank you.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.364
[chuckles]

10:30.760 --> 10:32.414
- [Audience] Ooh...

10:35.286 --> 10:36.810
[lighter flicking]

10:41.728 --> 10:43.730
- [Bunny] Rona, I thought
you left the door open.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.122
- [Rona] I thought I did.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.776
- [Bunny] Okay. [knocks] Mom?

10:47.385 --> 10:49.431
Mom, can you open
the door, please?

10:52.782 --> 10:54.349
[knocking] Mom!

10:55.785 --> 10:57.961
Mom, could you
please open the door?

10:58.745 --> 10:59.963
- Why didn't you use your key?

11:00.007 --> 11:02.444
- Well, I didn't want to
put the tray on the...

11:03.010 --> 11:03.837
ground.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.142
That's not sanitary.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.715
- Oh! Unh-unh! Bunny!

11:12.759 --> 11:15.196
Bunny, why you got the
potpourri, the Febreze,

11:15.239 --> 11:17.938
and the incense goin'
at the same time, girl?

11:17.981 --> 11:20.941
Got my nostrils
all confused. Ugh!

11:22.333 --> 11:25.859
Smellin' like Martha Stewart
doin' her laundry in Jamaica.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.034
- I didn't light that.

11:27.077 --> 11:29.863
I did not do that.
Mom? Was, was that you?

11:29.906 --> 11:31.429
I don't know. Maybe Carlyle.

11:31.473 --> 11:33.170
He gets to drinkin' those
protein shakes, and you know,

11:33.214 --> 11:35.477
it gets a little stinky
in there sometimes.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.000
[doorbell rings]

11:37.044 --> 11:38.785
Rona, can you get that?

11:40.003 --> 11:41.135
[intercom buzzes]

11:41.570 --> 11:43.311
You're supposed
to ask who it is.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.879
- Well, it's somebody
probably comin' to see you.

11:45.922 --> 11:48.185
And what's wrong with
lettin' somebody in

11:48.229 --> 11:49.926
who's been pushin'
all the buzzers

11:49.970 --> 11:51.841
because her man
won't let her in?

11:51.885 --> 11:54.757
Okay? Because he's upstairs
cheatin' with some other chick

11:54.801 --> 11:56.280
in his apartment!

11:57.934 --> 12:00.415
- That sounds like it's
from personal experience.

12:01.242 --> 12:03.157
- My bad, girl, I
had a flashback.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.333
[sighs] Geez.

12:05.376 --> 12:06.247
[knocking]

12:07.248 --> 12:09.467
Ooh. Um, I'm sorry, girl.

12:09.511 --> 12:10.860
We didn't order no Chinese food.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.253
You got the wrong place.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.254
- I'm Meho.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.212
- You a ho?

12:15.256 --> 12:16.866
Hey, everybody, this
Chinese girl talkin' about

12:16.910 --> 12:19.260
she got some Chinese food and
she's givin' away free boot--

12:19.303 --> 12:22.829
- [stammers] Rona, that's
my friend from the shop.

12:22.872 --> 12:23.786
[laughs] Stop.

12:23.830 --> 12:24.526
- Hey, girl.

12:24.569 --> 12:25.919
- Hi. Don't mind her.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.094
- Yeah, that's all right.
- [Bunny] Thank you.

12:27.137 --> 12:27.921
- Well, you was the
one comin' in here

12:27.964 --> 12:28.878
talkin' about you a ho.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.140
I didn't know what was goin' on.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.926
- It's Meho. But my
friends call me MeMe.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.797
- Oh, see, MeMe.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.234
That's good, because people
could get that confused.

12:37.278 --> 12:39.933
- You don't remember meeting
at the opening of my shop?

12:40.411 --> 12:43.197
- No, no. I vaguely
remember meeting Rona.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.939
But I do remember
meeting this lovely lady.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.071
Hello, Mrs. Charles.

12:48.115 --> 12:50.421
- Oh, MeMe!

12:51.335 --> 12:53.076
The personal trainer.
- [Meho] Mm hm.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.513
- Ooh, look at you,
with your cute self.

12:55.557 --> 12:56.340
How are you?

12:56.384 --> 12:57.907
- Fantastic, thanks.

12:57.951 --> 13:00.518
- And how is that massive
muscle of a man you were with?

13:00.562 --> 13:04.261
- Oh, he was a
chocolaty delight!

13:04.305 --> 13:07.961
- Wait. You were with
that fine young thing?

13:08.875 --> 13:11.138
So, I guess you be
chasin' the brothers, huh?

13:11.181 --> 13:13.401
- Actually, the
brothers be chasin' me.

13:13.444 --> 13:14.881
- I hear that.

13:14.924 --> 13:17.405
- Well, evidently, you
don't mind getting caught.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.886
So, I guess that
make you a slow Meho.

13:19.929 --> 13:20.930
- Rona.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.236
- Well, I just, I'm sorry.

13:22.279 --> 13:23.977
I don't know that many
Chinese people, okay?

13:24.978 --> 13:26.370
- Neither do I.

13:26.414 --> 13:29.547
But I do know quite a few
Vietnamese, like myself.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.201
- Well, what's the difference?

13:31.245 --> 13:33.290
- It'll probably take a
while to explain it to you.

13:33.334 --> 13:34.596
- [Audience] Ooh...

13:36.163 --> 13:36.946
- Try me.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.078
- Okay.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.558
This is the world.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.343
Here's China.

13:42.386 --> 13:44.432
And here's Vietnam.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.042
- And?

13:46.434 --> 13:47.827
- You proved my point.

13:48.262 --> 13:49.437
- Uh, MeMe.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.352
If you don't mind my asking...

13:51.395 --> 13:52.875
- Anything, Mrs. Charles.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.399
- Just how many years are
between you and that young man?

13:55.443 --> 13:59.099
- Oh, let's just say, he's
over the drinking age.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.014
- A sugar mama.

14:01.362 --> 14:04.539
- No. I don't date
broke men of any age.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.324
He has to be extremely
well put together.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.370
See, the guys I date?
- [Roxanne] Mm hm.

14:09.413 --> 14:10.893
- They have their
own businesses,

14:10.937 --> 14:12.503
and they work for
the corporate world.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.115
I just prefer young because,

14:15.158 --> 14:18.161
hell, it's just somethin'
about a young man wantin' you.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.468
If I can have 'em, why not?

14:20.511 --> 14:22.296
- [laughs] I hear that!

14:22.339 --> 14:24.994
A lot of young men
approach me, too.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.126
- I'm sure.

14:26.169 --> 14:26.909
- Mom.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.171
- Well, they do.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.999
- What? Okay. What do you say?

14:30.043 --> 14:31.479
- I just smile, and

14:31.522 --> 14:33.960
maybe I show 'em a little
somethin'. [snaps fingers]

14:34.003 --> 14:35.396
- [Bunny] Oh! Mom!

14:37.137 --> 14:38.529
- [laughs] Your father's
always gettin' compliments

14:38.573 --> 14:39.966
from younger women.

14:40.705 --> 14:43.360
- Mr. Charles is a
very handsome man.

14:43.404 --> 14:47.016
You know, he reminds me
of my first baby daddy.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.583
Except he's got a house,

14:49.236 --> 14:50.541
and a car,

14:50.977 --> 14:52.108
and a job.

14:52.630 --> 14:53.718
- And a wife?

14:53.762 --> 14:55.068
- No, he had a wife.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.244
- So, you're a mom.

14:57.766 --> 15:00.247
- Yes. A proud mother of three.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.205
- That's sweet.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.077
So, how long have
you been married?

15:04.642 --> 15:06.079
- Is that a joke?

15:06.427 --> 15:07.732
- No. I figured if you had kids,

15:07.776 --> 15:09.343
that you may be married.

15:09.386 --> 15:11.519
- Well, I'm not. Okay?

15:12.041 --> 15:13.390
And I know what you're thinkin'.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.958
Just because I'm a
beautiful, young black woman,

15:16.002 --> 15:17.742
doesn't make me a stereotype,

15:17.786 --> 15:19.962
if I got a baby daddy. Okay?

15:20.006 --> 15:22.747
- Okay. That's a lot
more information than
I was asking for.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.054
And I don't see you
as a stereotype.

15:25.446 --> 15:28.188
A statistic, maybe,
but not a stereotype.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.103
- Uh, Bunny.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.062
Was I supposed to cut her?

15:33.106 --> 15:35.238
Because she sounds like
she was tryin' to be snooty

15:35.282 --> 15:36.979
and educational
at the same time,

15:37.023 --> 15:38.241
and she's just got
me all confused.

15:38.285 --> 15:40.461
- Okay. Just, just play nice.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.071
That's all I'm asking.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.116
[doorbell rings] Just
for a little bit.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.291
Can you please get the door?

15:44.334 --> 15:45.945
[Rona sighs dramatically]
Thank you.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.251
Appreciate you.
- [Rona] Mm hm.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.471
You're my friend.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.560
[intercom buzzes]

15:53.169 --> 15:55.345
- [Bunny] Uh, you're
supposed to ask who it is.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.129
- [Rona] Really?

15:56.172 --> 15:57.652
- Yes.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.480
- [thuds] Whoever this is,
you gotta go back downstairs

15:59.523 --> 16:01.743
to the intercom so
I can ask who it is.

16:01.786 --> 16:04.789
- Okay. Just [knocking]
just open the door.

16:04.833 --> 16:05.747
[sighs]

16:08.054 --> 16:09.142
- Oop. Mm-mm.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.189
- [Bunny] Oh, Lavanya.
Hi, beautiful.

16:13.798 --> 16:14.495
- How are you?

16:14.538 --> 16:15.757
- [Bunny] Good.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.758
- Hey, do you think you
can open this for me?

16:16.801 --> 16:17.715
I chilled it earlier.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.456
It's from my vineyard in Sonoma.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.589
- Yes. Yes. This is MeMe.

16:21.632 --> 16:22.546
- Hi.
- [Meho] Hi.

16:22.590 --> 16:23.373
- This is my friend, Lavanya.

16:23.417 --> 16:24.200
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

16:24.244 --> 16:25.375
- Very nice to meet you.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.029
- That's a pretty
dress. Like the colors.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.335
- Thank you so much.

16:28.378 --> 16:29.640
- It's very beautiful.
She always looks nice.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.120
Although, I'd be
honored if she'd wear

16:31.164 --> 16:32.817
one of the dresses
from my boutique.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.471
From time to time, maybe?

16:34.515 --> 16:38.606
- Now, you know my style is
traditional, well-bred chic.

16:38.649 --> 16:39.346
Mrs. Charles.

16:39.389 --> 16:40.390
- Hey, Lavanya.

16:40.434 --> 16:41.870
- Yeah, Bunny.

16:41.913 --> 16:43.567
You know, you don't carry
that in your place, okay?

16:43.611 --> 16:45.613
So, what's that
designer's name, again?

16:45.656 --> 16:49.312
Oh yeah, um, Le Plain Jane.

16:49.356 --> 16:53.664
- Uh, at least I support
a sister, Ms. Jackson.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.232
I feel like I haven't
been in here in forever.

16:57.712 --> 17:00.193
Where'd you get this
painting? It's beautiful.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.759
- Carlyle. He did that.

17:01.803 --> 17:03.326
- Oh, he's really gifted.

17:03.370 --> 17:06.676
It has such a Betye Saar
feel to it. I love it.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.201
- [Bunny] Yeah.
- It's really nice.

17:08.243 --> 17:10.071
- So, how you been?

17:10.116 --> 17:11.377
- I'm doin' well.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.771
I left Derwin asleep in
front of the television.

17:13.815 --> 17:16.818
Dozin' off to some
jazz to soothe him.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.646
Listenin' to my kind of blue.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.126
He loves Miles Davis.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.431
- Aw. How is he?

17:21.823 --> 17:24.173
- He's doing well. He
was sick last night.

17:24.217 --> 17:26.348
His little, he had
a little tummy ache.

17:26.393 --> 17:27.698
You know?

17:27.742 --> 17:30.310
Alena made a special
dish that didn't sit well

17:30.353 --> 17:32.094
with his constitution.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.749
So, I just let him lie down,
and watch him lick himself.

17:34.792 --> 17:35.880
[laughs]

17:35.924 --> 17:37.404
- Wait. Did you
say "lick himself"?

17:38.361 --> 17:40.233
- Yeah. It makes his
tummy feel better.

17:40.276 --> 17:41.799
- You let your man lick himself?

17:41.843 --> 17:44.150
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
He's an Italian Bolognese.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.500
- Okay, now I see why I
haven't been to Italy.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.545
The people over
there are freaky.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.809
- Derwin is her dog, boo boo.

17:51.853 --> 17:55.335
- Derwin is not a dog.
Derwin is a Bolognese.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.250
He's family.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.687
Eugene got him for me for
our fifth year anniversary,

17:59.730 --> 18:01.732
and he's been with
us for five years.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.735
- By the size of that
ring, I'd say you are

18:04.779 --> 18:06.607
a very lucky woman.

18:07.434 --> 18:08.913
- I am.

18:08.957 --> 18:11.394
I can go on forever about
that man, I tell you.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.570
- Oh, no, you know,
let's, let's not, uh,

18:13.614 --> 18:15.572
let's not talk
about men right now.

18:16.182 --> 18:16.834
[doorbell rings]

18:16.878 --> 18:17.879
Uh, that must be...

18:17.922 --> 18:19.272
Yeah, that's Brittany.

18:20.273 --> 18:23.232
- Ugh. Miss
Summa-Here-She-Cum-Laude.

18:23.276 --> 18:26.279
Whew! God, does everybody
in here have a PhD?

18:26.322 --> 18:27.758
Because if you don't, she's
gonna make you feel like

18:27.802 --> 18:28.716
you need three of 'em.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.239
- Oh, come on.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.414
There's nothing wrong
with somebody helping you

18:31.458 --> 18:32.807
with your grammar
from time to time.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.809
- Child, the girl
teaches grade school,

18:34.852 --> 18:36.854
and acts like she's the
professor at Harvard.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.247
- It's better than
you walkin' around

18:38.291 --> 18:39.596
talkin' about conversates.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.945
- I know, that's true.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.251
- Yeah.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.775
She just loves
education. That's it.

18:49.432 --> 18:50.520
- Brace myself.

18:50.564 --> 18:53.349
- [Bunny] Hi.
- Hi! Hello, everyone.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.612
I see we're all
here in attendance.

18:55.656 --> 18:56.787
Fantastic.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.833
You must be Meho Nguyen.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.313
- Yes. How did you know?

19:00.356 --> 19:02.402
- Because I memorized
it. From my contact list.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.969
- [MeMe] Oh, good to see you.
- So glad you came.

19:05.013 --> 19:07.320
Rona. Darling.
- [Rona] Hey, girl.

19:07.798 --> 19:10.323
Lavanya. Glad to see you.
- [Lavanya] Hello.

19:10.366 --> 19:11.280
Good to see you.

19:11.324 --> 19:12.238
- Mrs. Charles.

19:12.281 --> 19:13.456
I have some sticky notes for us

19:13.500 --> 19:15.197
to write our names down, okay?

19:15.241 --> 19:17.678
- Brittany. Why do
we need sticky notes?

19:18.809 --> 19:20.724
- So we all know who
we're speaking to.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.639
- Oh yeah, we kinda
already know each other.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.685
- Yeah, so sit your
crazy butt down.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.469
- Oh, yeah. True.

19:26.991 --> 19:29.472
- Um [clears throat],
you know, I think

19:29.516 --> 19:31.518
this is actually a good
time to get started.

19:31.866 --> 19:34.347
Okay. So, I want to thank
everybody for coming

19:34.390 --> 19:36.218
to our first Ladies Book Club.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.264
Thank you so much. Thank you.

19:38.612 --> 19:39.700
I'm really excited,

19:39.743 --> 19:41.789
and I hope that
this isn't our last.

19:41.832 --> 19:44.531
Okay, so, we'll just
jump right on in

19:44.922 --> 19:46.359
with our first book,

19:46.402 --> 19:49.275
"Know Your Man As Well
As You Know Yourself".

19:50.363 --> 19:52.800
Rona, where's your book?

19:53.496 --> 19:54.541
- I didn't bring it.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.325
I mean, you know, the kids,

19:56.369 --> 19:57.718
they tore out some of the pages.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.241
I read what was there, you know,

19:59.285 --> 20:01.417
the ones that weren't just
tore out of the thing.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.550
- I figured there may
be someone without.

20:03.593 --> 20:05.247
There's always that one.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.380
So, Rona, I brought an extra.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.033
- Oh, well...

20:09.077 --> 20:10.339
- [Brittany] Here you go.

20:10.383 --> 20:11.732
- Thanks. That was
very nice of you.

20:12.341 --> 20:13.603
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.475
Why is my name already in here?

20:15.518 --> 20:16.650
- Um, you know what?

20:16.693 --> 20:19.261
Before we get into
the actual chapters,

20:19.305 --> 20:21.872
does anybody have any comments
about the book, in general?

20:24.310 --> 20:25.485
Okay, go ahead, Brit.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.400
- I do.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.706
Okay, can you
believe that I found,

20:29.750 --> 20:32.579
in this nationally
published literary work,

20:32.622 --> 20:36.887
seven misspelled words,
43 comma splices,

20:36.931 --> 20:38.715
12 dangling participles--

20:38.759 --> 20:40.021
- Brittany. Brittany?

20:40.064 --> 20:41.544
We're not editing the book.

20:41.588 --> 20:44.373
We're just, we're here to
express our thoughts, you know?

20:44.417 --> 20:46.070
Thoughts about the
different chapters,

20:46.114 --> 20:47.594
the author's perspective,

20:47.637 --> 20:49.900
just, talk about
things of that nature.

20:50.771 --> 20:55.297
- Oh. So, no one noticed the
subject pronoun discriminates?

20:55.341 --> 20:59.562
- No one has that much spare
time on their hands, okay?

20:59.606 --> 21:01.390
Spare time ain't got
that much spare time.

21:01.434 --> 21:02.609
[laughing]

21:03.610 --> 21:06.047
- Well, I do have
a favorite chapter.

21:06.917 --> 21:09.398
"How Men View Women".

21:09.442 --> 21:10.921
- Oh ho ho, yes.

21:10.965 --> 21:13.924
Yes, I found that chapter
very interesting myself.

21:13.968 --> 21:16.362
- So, you all agree
that the male gaze

21:16.405 --> 21:18.581
is just a psychological
facade of his fear

21:18.625 --> 21:20.670
of tapping into his femininity?

21:20.714 --> 21:25.022
- Well, my chapter was
"Where the Power Lies".

21:27.373 --> 21:28.722
- Yeah, I taught my baby, Bunny.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.071
I taught her where the power.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.638
I taught her about
that a long time ago.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.117
Before she was even born.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.467
- Preach it, Mrs. Charles.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.338
We need a mature point
of view up in here.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.427
- I agree with the
author when he said,

21:38.471 --> 21:40.516
now, this is a
male-dominated world,

21:40.560 --> 21:42.562
and women, we
automatically think that,

21:42.605 --> 21:44.738
so we relinquish our power.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.957
Uh huh. But let me tell ya.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.786
I taught my baby about power
before she was even born,

21:49.830 --> 21:50.961
when she was...

21:51.005 --> 21:52.354
- She did.

21:52.398 --> 21:53.616
- Let me tell ya.
The house we live in?

21:53.660 --> 21:54.704
I want it.

21:54.748 --> 21:55.879
Power.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.621
Family reunion,
hosting it. Power.

21:58.665 --> 22:00.667
Going to Europe.

22:01.189 --> 22:02.582
Super power!

22:02.625 --> 22:04.627
- Now, that sounds
like manipulation.

22:04.671 --> 22:05.933
- I agree.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.675
- A woman is supposed to
rest at her man's feet.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.503
- Now, that I don't agree.

22:10.546 --> 22:11.765
- Yeah. Like a pet?

22:12.113 --> 22:14.724
- No, not under his
feet. At his feet.

22:14.768 --> 22:17.684
A man is the king of the
castle. The bread winner.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.817
Emasculating him
for selfish reasons

22:20.861 --> 22:23.864
usually leads to the
demise of you both.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.561
- Oh. Nah-uh.

22:25.605 --> 22:28.172
I believe a man should be
the head of his household,

22:28.216 --> 22:32.481
but I am not going to be a
second-class citizen to no man.

22:32.525 --> 22:34.657
He is to cater to
me as I to him.

22:34.701 --> 22:35.876
- Preach it.

22:35.919 --> 22:38.095
- How you say it, givin'
my man a smack-down?

22:38.139 --> 22:41.664
That's not my way of deceiving
him to get what I want.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.927
Uh-uh. Lovemaking,
that's what we do,

22:43.971 --> 22:45.538
as a husband and a wife.

22:45.581 --> 22:47.409
But don't get me wrong
now. Don't get me wrong.

22:47.453 --> 22:48.845
If my husband needs
a little nudge,

22:48.889 --> 22:51.848
mama, I pull out
the bulldozer, now.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.241
But, but...

22:53.284 --> 22:55.069
My husband, he got to
sway me a little bit, too,

22:55.112 --> 22:56.592
to get what he want.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.028
Big Daddy, no, he got
to take care of business

22:58.072 --> 22:59.987
to get them, okay?

23:00.944 --> 23:03.033
- I guess it's different
between Eugene and I

23:03.077 --> 23:04.905
because we have that
special connection.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.515
We're like soulmates.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.082
We always know what the
other one is thinking,

23:08.125 --> 23:10.171
and we make the
proper accommodations.

23:10.998 --> 23:12.216
- You know, I think
this is a perfect time

23:12.260 --> 23:14.480
to segue-way into a
chapter I highlighted,

23:14.523 --> 23:17.221
which is "Are Men
and Women Equal".

23:17.265 --> 23:18.745
- Hell, no!

23:19.006 --> 23:21.487
But we know why they
think they rule the world.

23:21.530 --> 23:24.054
- Hey girl, I know a
few who clearly know

23:24.098 --> 23:27.057
that what they got
ain't rulin' nothin'.

23:27.101 --> 23:30.017
Their egos make them think
they can rule the world.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.584
- Okay, now that I agree with.

23:31.627 --> 23:32.759
I agree with that.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.891
- But men do rule everything.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.763
I mean, they're the
heroes in the movies,

23:36.806 --> 23:38.025
the president,

23:38.068 --> 23:39.200
and they can make the babies,

23:39.243 --> 23:40.636
and not even have to
take care of them.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.725
- That's one of the
points that he makes.

23:42.769 --> 23:43.900
Honestly, and women,

23:43.944 --> 23:45.989
even if we don't see
it or realize it,

23:46.033 --> 23:47.948
subconsciously, we
do not see ourselves

23:47.991 --> 23:48.992
as equal to men.

23:49.036 --> 23:50.516
We don't.

23:50.559 --> 23:51.734
And until we do, we won't
see a female president.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.910
- But as, as for
making babies...

23:53.954 --> 23:55.956
Now, they can only
get what we give them.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.741
- Yeah, but see, us women, we
still need all that comfort,

23:58.785 --> 23:59.655
you know?

23:59.699 --> 24:00.569
- Yeah.

24:00.613 --> 24:01.918
- I don't know, ladies.

24:01.962 --> 24:04.007
I have a different perspective.

24:04.051 --> 24:06.488
I think women can get
exactly what they need

24:06.532 --> 24:08.011
from another woman.

24:08.664 --> 24:11.493
Because they understand the
void which needs to be filled.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.190
Now men, on the
other hand, well,

24:13.234 --> 24:16.280
they find satisfaction
in the external things.

24:16.324 --> 24:18.239
You know, the things that
capture their attention,

24:18.282 --> 24:19.936
and supplements that need.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.329
Like a PlayStation.

24:21.372 --> 24:23.897
- That sounds like somethin'
a lesbian would say.

24:25.115 --> 24:26.769
- Not a lesbian, Rona.

24:26.813 --> 24:29.685
A feminist, who believes
in being empowered.

24:29.729 --> 24:31.121
- Yeah, but see, you're
always talkin' all that

24:31.165 --> 24:34.516
women's lib stuff, but you
never talk about any man

24:34.560 --> 24:37.563
that you have
actually liberated.

24:37.606 --> 24:40.130
- Yes, because I want to
find a man like my father.

24:40.174 --> 24:41.958
So my standards are high.

24:42.002 --> 24:44.787
But this does not include
finances or accomplishments.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.833
Rather, the kind of man.

24:47.660 --> 24:51.185
I-I must say, it's been an
interesting, but fun, search.

24:51.228 --> 24:54.623
There are a lot of alternatives
to traditional dating.

24:55.581 --> 24:58.671
And honestly, this book
has helped influence that.

24:58.714 --> 24:59.715
- Really?

24:59.759 --> 25:00.890
- Yeah.

25:00.934 --> 25:03.240
Some of you, like
Bunny, may not agree

25:03.284 --> 25:04.154
because we've
discussed it before--

25:04.198 --> 25:05.547
- Oh, gosh. Oh, goodness.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.157
Are we talkin'
about online dating?

25:07.201 --> 25:08.811
- Yeah, that is crazy.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.117
- What's wrong with that?

25:10.160 --> 25:11.684
- It's unorthodox.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.163
- Yeah, it's...

25:13.686 --> 25:14.600
What she said.

25:14.643 --> 25:15.992
Yeah, it's just really crazy.

25:16.036 --> 25:17.820
- Look, even if you meet
someone at the club,

25:17.864 --> 25:19.126
or on the street,

25:19.169 --> 25:20.954
sometimes you don't
find out they're crazy

25:20.997 --> 25:22.651
until you go out with them.

25:22.695 --> 25:25.045
At least, you can look
at someone's profile,

25:25.088 --> 25:26.307
email each other.

25:26.350 --> 25:27.569
You can pick some things up.

25:27.613 --> 25:28.570
- Exactly.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.137
- However a person deceives you,

25:30.180 --> 25:31.660
if it's gonna happen,
it's gonna happen.

25:31.704 --> 25:34.576
And truthfully, it's just,
it's just not for me.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.709
It's too much. I don't, I
don't, I think it's weird.

25:37.013 --> 25:38.319
- Who you signed
up with, Brittany?

25:38.362 --> 25:41.931
- Oh, MatchDate.com,
LoveConnections.com--

25:41.975 --> 25:43.890
- DesperateLonelyGeeks.com.

25:45.108 --> 25:46.719
- [laughs] Well,
how does it work?

25:47.371 --> 25:49.591
- You go to a website,
create your profile,

25:49.635 --> 25:51.854
list career, hobbies,
and philosophies,

25:51.898 --> 25:53.682
you know, the things that
people are attracted to,

25:53.726 --> 25:54.857
pay your fee,

25:54.901 --> 25:56.772
and then watch the
requests come in.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.949
- So you pay a fee,
there are requests.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.908
So, it's like a web pimp?

26:03.083 --> 26:04.693
- No, Lavanya.

26:04.737 --> 26:05.999
- Well, show us something.

26:06.042 --> 26:08.044
- Okay. Bunny, go
get your laptop.

26:08.088 --> 26:11.395
- Oh, okay. Laptop on the way.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.920
- This should be
very interesting.

26:13.963 --> 26:15.617
- You all are in for a treat.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.010
- You think so, Mrs. Charles?

26:18.533 --> 26:22.668
You think you could find a
man like Mr. Charles online?

26:23.146 --> 26:24.278
I doubt it.

26:25.018 --> 26:27.324
I know I can't find
a man like Eugene

26:27.368 --> 26:29.152
on an online dating site.

26:29.196 --> 26:33.156
I mean, first of all,
God put us together.

26:33.940 --> 26:38.945
And secondly, Eugene would
never do something so foolhardy.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.861
- Okay, come on, Brittany.
Let's see what you...

26:41.904 --> 26:43.427
[ladies talking over each other]

26:43.471 --> 26:45.734
- All right, ladies, gather
around. Come on, gather around.

26:45.778 --> 26:47.736
- [Roxanne] Ooh. Wait,
wait, wait, wait.

26:47.780 --> 26:48.868
I don't want to miss nothin'.

26:48.911 --> 26:50.260
- Don't worry, I'm
just signing in.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.655
- Oh! What does that mean?

26:53.699 --> 26:56.092
- Wow. 1,000 requests?

26:56.136 --> 26:59.095
- Hold on. No, no, no, no.
She got 1,000 requests?

26:59.139 --> 27:00.401
Honey, well, then sign me up.

27:00.444 --> 27:02.708
All they need to do is
look at this boot-tay

27:02.751 --> 27:04.318
and this thang gonna crash!

27:05.058 --> 27:07.277
- Ohh, that's a cute picture.
- [Brittany] Yeah.

27:07.321 --> 27:08.409
- [Meho] And who is that?

27:08.452 --> 27:11.673
- That's James,
a.k.a. Mr. Magic.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.109
He was one of my
dates from last week.

27:13.153 --> 27:14.894
- Wait. "One" of them?

27:14.937 --> 27:17.374
- Yeah. I did what you
call a date-cation.

27:17.418 --> 27:20.247
So, I went on a date for
breakfast, lunch and dinner

27:20.290 --> 27:21.944
for seven straight days.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.511
- Impressive.

27:23.554 --> 27:26.340
- So, you mean to tell me that
you ate three times a day,

27:26.383 --> 27:27.820
for seven days straight,

27:27.863 --> 27:30.866
with a different man for
every meal, for free?

27:31.432 --> 27:32.955
- [Brittany] Yeah.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.087
- Well, honey, you better
just give me that computer now

27:34.130 --> 27:35.131
because, you know,
me and my kids,

27:35.175 --> 27:37.264
we gonna eat all
year. [laughing]

27:38.004 --> 27:40.310
- It's not used for evil, Rona.

27:40.963 --> 27:43.705
- [Meho] Brittany, weren't
you worried about stalkers?

27:43.749 --> 27:46.273
- Well, you did run into
your borderline psychos,

27:46.316 --> 27:48.928
but I managed to weed out
the possible dangerous ones.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.712
- Oh, girl, the stalker I had?

27:50.756 --> 27:52.845
I had to stalk his ass back.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.150
He'd call me, hang up.

27:54.194 --> 27:56.283
So I'd call him, and hang up.

27:56.326 --> 27:57.545
He'd be sittin' in
front of my house,

27:57.588 --> 27:59.155
and by the time he got
up to leave to go home,

27:59.199 --> 28:02.071
I'd be sittin' in house,
waitin' on his ass.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.986
Then once, he went to my job

28:04.030 --> 28:05.292
when I was on my way to his job,

28:05.335 --> 28:06.772
and we sat in the parking lot,

28:06.815 --> 28:09.035
just staring at each other,
calling and hanging up.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.212
- So, when did it end?

28:12.255 --> 28:13.517
- When I found out he had a wife

28:13.561 --> 28:14.823
'cause she was sittin'
over there in her car,

28:14.867 --> 28:16.216
stalkin' both of us.

28:16.259 --> 28:17.783
So me and him had to
take a restraining order

28:17.826 --> 28:19.349
out on her crazy ass.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.395
- [Lavanya] Oh, wow. Sheesh.

28:21.438 --> 28:24.224
- So, what are these formulas
in the note section here?

28:24.267 --> 28:26.356
- Well, that's a
record of each date.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.185
And you see, right here
is date, time and details,

28:29.229 --> 28:31.884
by all the guys, with
an algorithm by them,

28:31.927 --> 28:33.929
to calculate the results
of my hypothesis.

28:34.364 --> 28:35.496
- Hm?

28:36.105 --> 28:38.455
- You know, who I
would end up with.

28:38.499 --> 28:39.326
- [All] Oh...

28:39.369 --> 28:40.327
- Okay.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.285
- Oh, I was off by one.

28:42.329 --> 28:44.766
- Well, I didn't know
you needed a noble prize

28:44.810 --> 28:46.420
in physics to get a date.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.989
- You don't, but you at least
need to know how to read,

28:50.032 --> 28:51.512
and have a job.

28:53.079 --> 28:54.254
- Hold on, now.

28:54.820 --> 28:59.259
My men do have jobs,
and they can read.

28:59.868 --> 29:02.218
- Well, I don't remember
the classifieds, it listing,

29:02.262 --> 29:04.133
"Looking for Felons, Thieves,

29:04.177 --> 29:06.266
"Repeated Offenders,
or Who Dat Watchers".

29:06.309 --> 29:07.963
- Who Dat Watchers?

29:08.572 --> 29:10.792
- Yeah, you know, the guys
that stand on the corner,

29:10.836 --> 29:12.533
and watch cars go
by, and they're like,

29:13.099 --> 29:15.579
"Who dat?", "Hey, yo,
who dat?" [laughs]

29:15.623 --> 29:17.146
- Girl, bye.

29:17.190 --> 29:20.149
- Well, Brittany, thank you for
your online dating tutorial.

29:20.193 --> 29:22.195
I think you've kinda
broadened our horizons.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.850
- [Meho] I'll be signing up.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.286
- Yeah. [claps]

29:26.329 --> 29:27.983
- Hey, Bunny, can you open
another bottle, please?

29:28.027 --> 29:29.289
[doorbell rings]

29:29.332 --> 29:30.507
- [Brittanty] Oh, I'll
get that. Excusez-moi.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.292
- Yeah. You, you're
not finished with that.

29:32.335 --> 29:34.120
But I'll get it. I gotcha.

29:34.642 --> 29:35.991
- [intercom buzzes] Hello?

29:36.470 --> 29:38.428
- [Voiceover] Hi. I'm
here for the book club.

29:39.125 --> 29:41.388
- [intercom buzzes] Oh,
um, may I ask who this is?

29:42.084 --> 29:43.433
- [Voiceover] Helema.

29:44.086 --> 29:45.174
- [intercom buzzes] Helema?

29:45.653 --> 29:47.829
Shoot. [intercom buzzes] Uh...

29:47.873 --> 29:49.222
Give me one second.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.139
Bunny? I need to speak with you.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.054
Uh, yeah.

29:55.097 --> 29:57.317
There's been a little mistake
with sending out the evites.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.014
- Oh, no mistake.
Everybody's here.

29:59.058 --> 30:01.190
Except for Mary and Yvonne,
but I knew they weren't coming.

30:02.017 --> 30:03.932
- Yeah, but when I
sent out the evites,

30:03.976 --> 30:06.195
I accidentally added a
person on my contact list

30:06.239 --> 30:08.154
from friends I knew
from back in the day.

30:08.589 --> 30:09.895
Because she found
me on Facebook,

30:09.938 --> 30:11.200
and gave me her email address.

30:11.244 --> 30:12.854
So, I just added her
to my friends from

30:12.898 --> 30:14.900
back in the day contact list.

30:14.943 --> 30:16.162
Well, I took those emails,

30:16.205 --> 30:17.424
and then the ones
that you gave me,

30:17.467 --> 30:19.861
and then I created the
book club contact list.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.907
I also added a couple of
people I knew from work,

30:21.950 --> 30:23.430
but I already knew that
they weren't gonna come,

30:23.473 --> 30:25.519
so I just figured I'd
extend the invite anyway.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.086
But could you believe
that out of everyone

30:27.129 --> 30:28.870
that could've come,
it was the one person

30:28.914 --> 30:31.394
that I mistakenly added to
the book club contact list,

30:31.438 --> 30:33.396
from the friends I knew from
back in the day contact list,

30:33.440 --> 30:35.355
well, I didn't know she was
on the book club contact list,

30:35.398 --> 30:36.486
until she just buzzed in--

30:36.530 --> 30:38.401
- Okay, stop,
please, and tell me

30:38.445 --> 30:39.838
who you're talkin' about
before you're the first

30:39.881 --> 30:42.536
of my friends I have
contacted and strangled list.

30:43.232 --> 30:44.364
No, you know, nevermind...
- [Brittany] Uh oh.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.105
- Because I'm gonna
find out, what?

30:48.934 --> 30:50.326
- Oh, shoot.

30:52.241 --> 30:54.156
- Bunny. Hey, girl.

30:54.548 --> 30:55.941
- Helema Jones.

30:56.506 --> 30:58.160
- Don't sound so shocked.

30:58.204 --> 30:59.161
I mean, that's how
everyone sounds

30:59.205 --> 31:00.510
now that I'm back in the city.

31:00.554 --> 31:01.903
Hey, girls.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.905
Actually, you know
what? I'm sorry.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.298
Before I do my hugs and kisses,

31:05.341 --> 31:06.429
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

31:06.473 --> 31:08.170
Can you point me to where...

31:08.214 --> 31:09.345
- Right there. Yep.

31:09.389 --> 31:11.043
- [Helema] Okay,
great. I'll be back...

31:13.175 --> 31:14.394
- You invited her?

31:14.437 --> 31:16.352
- That was all Brittany.

31:16.396 --> 31:19.051
- I-I-I, it was
totally a mistake.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.269
I-I didn't mean it.

31:20.313 --> 31:22.054
- What's wrong with
her? She seems nice.

31:22.097 --> 31:24.360
- What's wrong is that
she used to date Carlyle

31:24.404 --> 31:26.014
and broke his heart.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.495
- Broke? You mean
eviscerated it.

31:28.538 --> 31:29.409
- Smashed it.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.192
- Incinerated it.

31:30.236 --> 31:31.063
- Shredded it.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.020
- Mutilated it.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.282
- Snatched it out of his chest,

31:33.326 --> 31:34.936
swallowed it down with
a bottle of Patron,

31:34.980 --> 31:35.850
then spit it back out again.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.026
- Okay, Rona. I think we get it.

31:38.070 --> 31:39.941
And on top of that, she's
never really liked me

31:39.985 --> 31:41.377
because of Carlyle.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.118
When they were dating, she
always had to find a way

31:43.162 --> 31:44.946
to let me know that was her man.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.513
And then, anytime we were
supposed to hang out,

31:46.556 --> 31:47.731
she would all of
sudden get sick,

31:47.775 --> 31:49.951
or all of a sudden, she
needed him urgently.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.953
- And you didn't like her
'cause you both shared

31:51.997 --> 31:53.085
the same name.

31:53.563 --> 31:55.565
- Ooh, the same name.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.089
- Lucky Carlyle.

31:59.091 --> 32:00.701
- So, how did you
get the name Bunny?

32:00.744 --> 32:02.398
- Oh, I gave her Bunny,

32:02.442 --> 32:05.314
'cause she was our
little bunny-wabbit
when she was a baby.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.535
- Yeah. We went to
high school together,

32:08.578 --> 32:10.015
and then we went to State,

32:10.058 --> 32:11.668
and then we decided
to be roommates.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.540
I had to really go by Bunny
'cause I didn't want people

32:13.583 --> 32:16.412
blaming me for all the
crazy crap she was doin'.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.067
- I haven't like her
since high school

32:19.111 --> 32:21.461
because she dated
everybody's man.

32:21.504 --> 32:22.679
- What? In high school?

32:23.376 --> 32:25.073
- She didn't date
any of my boyfriends.

32:25.117 --> 32:26.466
- That's because by the
time they got to you,

32:26.509 --> 32:28.076
she had already dated 'em.

32:28.120 --> 32:31.036
[laughs] Yeah, you had more
rebounds than Charles Barkley.

32:32.167 --> 32:33.516
- Not my Marty.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.171
He was sweet and innocent.

32:36.215 --> 32:37.999
He never pressured sex.

32:38.043 --> 32:39.261
- Marty the mortician?

32:39.305 --> 32:41.698
He worked at his
father's mortuary.

32:41.742 --> 32:44.571
- Brittany, nobody
wanted him, okay?

32:44.614 --> 32:47.052
Look, he had the
cold, clammy hands.

32:47.095 --> 32:48.705
What was that we
used to call him?

32:49.619 --> 32:51.099
Zombie.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.145
Zombie. [ladies laughing]

32:53.797 --> 32:55.321
- Let me guess...

32:55.364 --> 32:59.281
You're talking about Zombie,
a.k.a. Marty the mortician?

33:00.369 --> 33:01.501
Yeah, I slept with him.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.720
In one of his coffins. Yeah.

33:03.764 --> 33:06.158
He even lined up the
bodies, to watch.

33:06.201 --> 33:07.768
- Ew, creepy.

33:07.811 --> 33:09.639
- [Helema] Yeah, I
had to let him go.

33:09.683 --> 33:11.511
- Well, it sounds
like you enjoyed it.

33:11.554 --> 33:14.035
- Oh, I did, but he
wanted to bring another

33:14.079 --> 33:15.645
female into the mix.

33:15.689 --> 33:16.733
- Who?

33:16.777 --> 33:18.344
- Uh, one of the dead ones.

33:18.387 --> 33:19.519
- [All] Ew.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.435
- I am mortified.

33:23.175 --> 33:26.700
- Mrs. Charles!
You look amazing!

33:28.310 --> 33:31.357
- Helema! Oh, how are you?

33:31.400 --> 33:33.054
What brings you to town?

33:33.098 --> 33:34.621
- Oh, well, you know,

33:34.664 --> 33:36.666
my family still owns the
first house that we have,

33:36.710 --> 33:39.756
and uh, the family that's
living there is moving out.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.064
I'm moving in, getting
situated, and just, you know,

33:43.108 --> 33:44.065
handling some other business.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.371
- Oh...[chuckles]

33:49.723 --> 33:51.072
- Bunny...

33:53.466 --> 33:54.423
Is, uh...

33:55.555 --> 33:56.817
Carlyle living here?

33:57.861 --> 33:59.646
- Yeah. Yeah, he is.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.040
- I guessed right.

34:03.737 --> 34:06.566
I mean, you were so
close in college, and...

34:07.219 --> 34:11.223
there's all the pictures of you
on Brittany's Facebook page.

34:11.571 --> 34:12.789
And you're still here.

34:13.485 --> 34:14.661
- Still here.

34:15.183 --> 34:16.576
Yes, I am.

34:18.186 --> 34:21.362
- Well, Mrs, Charles, I was
told specifically by my mother

34:21.407 --> 34:22.886
to say hello to you.

34:22.929 --> 34:26.411
And to let you know that the
ladies are just so pleased

34:26.455 --> 34:27.891
that you are doing so well.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.589
- It was just a minor scare.

34:30.284 --> 34:31.547
How are your parents?

34:31.591 --> 34:32.766
- Oh, they're fantastic.

34:32.809 --> 34:34.811
They both retired
from their practices,

34:34.855 --> 34:35.725
and they're traveling,

34:35.768 --> 34:36.596
but still in Connecticut.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.293
- Ah, Stanford.

34:39.599 --> 34:40.730
- [laughs] Westbury.

34:40.774 --> 34:43.777
- Oh. Forgive me.
You are The Joneses.

34:44.603 --> 34:47.868
I don't think I've seen your
mother for about five years.

34:47.911 --> 34:48.782
- Yeah.

34:48.824 --> 34:50.304
- Yeah. Last time I saw...

34:50.349 --> 34:52.568
You was, a picture of you
in that big old photo album

34:52.612 --> 34:56.137
she used to carry and bring to
our regional Herald meetings.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.834
You had on a cute little
cheerleader outfit,

34:57.878 --> 34:59.880
and hugged up with
some football player.

35:00.533 --> 35:01.621
- Hmm...

35:01.969 --> 35:04.450
That must have been
the Chargers...

35:04.798 --> 35:07.627
Or maybe the, uh, Eagles.

35:08.454 --> 35:10.325
Or maybe the Dolphins.

35:10.847 --> 35:12.545
I don't know. I was
doing all three.

35:12.588 --> 35:14.329
- What team are you doin' now?

35:15.635 --> 35:16.636
- Rona, is it?

35:17.289 --> 35:18.420
- Yeah.

35:18.768 --> 35:20.640
- You are Bunny's
friend from high school,

35:20.683 --> 35:22.772
who used to come up
to college to visit.

35:22.816 --> 35:24.426
- Yes, I am.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.950
- Yeah. Too bad
you couldn't stay.

35:26.994 --> 35:29.344
- Look, I had
things to do, okay?

35:29.910 --> 35:31.781
- Babies, right?

35:31.825 --> 35:32.826
Like six?

35:32.869 --> 35:34.349
- Don't try me. Three.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.396
- Well, sorry, I just
couldn't keep track.

35:37.439 --> 35:40.399
I mean, every time I saw
you, you were pregnant.

35:40.660 --> 35:41.791
- Helema.

35:43.315 --> 35:44.751
You've come just in time.

35:45.317 --> 35:47.319
Bunny, here, she was
getting ready to, uh,

35:47.362 --> 35:49.277
introduce the next
topic to discuss.

35:49.321 --> 35:50.713
- Ah! [chuckles]

35:54.326 --> 35:55.762
I want to discuss...

35:55.805 --> 35:57.372
I don't know where
my book, oh...

36:00.245 --> 36:01.724
"The Pact".

36:01.768 --> 36:04.553
- Okay. Really not one of
my favorites, in particular,

36:04.597 --> 36:05.772
but okay, Mom.

36:05.815 --> 36:06.947
We'll discuss it.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.341
- Well, the pact? It's settling.

36:09.384 --> 36:12.518
- Yeah, but, but it's
definitely fitting, Brittany.

36:12.561 --> 36:14.650
I mean, it's about
a man and a woman

36:14.694 --> 36:16.522
who've known each other
for quite some time.

36:16.565 --> 36:18.785
She knows him, he knows her.

36:19.612 --> 36:20.787
And they make a pact.

36:20.830 --> 36:23.616
"If we're still single
after five years,

36:23.659 --> 36:25.357
"then let's just get married."

36:26.532 --> 36:28.795
- Bunny, is that what
you and Carlyle have?

36:29.622 --> 36:32.712
- No. And Mom, who
does that? Really.

36:32.755 --> 36:34.366
- The Branches, from
across the street.

36:34.409 --> 36:37.325
They were friends, and they
found each other after 30 years.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.501
- They were 80 years old
when they got married.

36:39.545 --> 36:41.155
They had nobody else.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.505
I mean, they got married on a
Sunday, and died on a Monday.

36:43.549 --> 36:44.854
- Did the sex kill 'em?

36:44.898 --> 36:48.641
- No, no. The point is,
they didn't die alone.

36:50.991 --> 36:54.386
- How about we talk about
"The Three Fs" chapter.

36:54.429 --> 36:58.390
You know: football,
feed him, and fellatio.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.653
- Oh my. My, my, my, my.

37:00.696 --> 37:03.873
- Yes. Highlighted every page.

37:04.439 --> 37:07.399
- Ooh, I think it was
a waste of a chapter.

37:07.877 --> 37:10.576
I mean, my Eugene
despises football,

37:10.619 --> 37:12.795
and our cook prepares our food,

37:13.666 --> 37:14.928
and, uh...

37:16.016 --> 37:18.627
There are some things,
ladies, let's face it,

37:18.671 --> 37:21.500
that just don't
belong in your mouth.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.459
- So, you've never?

37:25.068 --> 37:27.549
- Oh, no. My Eugene
would never look at me

37:27.593 --> 37:28.985
the same way again.

37:29.029 --> 37:31.292
- Well, that's because
you're not doing it right.

37:31.336 --> 37:34.600
Because if you were, his eyes
would be closed and crossed.

37:35.949 --> 37:39.431
- No, it just proves that
you don't have to do all that

37:39.909 --> 37:42.695
to keep your significant other.

37:43.739 --> 37:46.089
- Well [sighs], it's
been proven that most men

37:46.133 --> 37:48.831
fall for the ones who they
have shared interests with.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.921
You know, sports,
habits, hobbies.

37:51.965 --> 37:56.056
That's why I bought a
PlayStation, Xbox, Wii.

37:56.099 --> 37:59.407
So, you know, it's good for
you to be able to beat them.

37:59.451 --> 38:00.713
'Cause it keeps
them around longer.

38:00.756 --> 38:03.803
Their egos just can't
handle losing quietly.

38:04.369 --> 38:07.459
So, they start off as
friends, because, you know,

38:07.502 --> 38:09.330
when you're playing
together all that time,

38:09.374 --> 38:10.897
you start sharing things.

38:10.940 --> 38:12.768
But then, at a certain
point, they realize

38:12.812 --> 38:14.857
that the only thing missing...

38:14.901 --> 38:16.642
is the sex.

38:16.946 --> 38:19.949
And then, you spent
all that time sharing,

38:19.993 --> 38:23.301
now you know how to
satisfy each other.

38:23.866 --> 38:25.868
When the time comes.

38:26.608 --> 38:29.350
- I don't know, Bunny. Sounds
like you and Carlyle to me.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.787
- Well, you know,
Carlyle always said

38:31.831 --> 38:34.399
him and Bunny have a
special connection.

38:34.834 --> 38:37.750
But, you know, he
couldn't detach from me.

38:37.793 --> 38:40.056
And that's where I got
the PlayStation idea.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.363
- Well, you know,
if I'm not mistaken,

38:42.407 --> 38:44.931
word around campus is
you were putting it down,

38:44.974 --> 38:47.499
and out, often.

38:47.542 --> 38:50.371
- Oh, rumors. They
do create popularity.

38:50.415 --> 38:51.938
- Oh, you were very popular.

38:51.981 --> 38:53.592
- Oh, but we both were.

38:53.635 --> 38:56.551
I mean, look at
us. Together again.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.597
The two Helemas.

38:59.119 --> 39:01.469
- We were roommates in college.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.819
- That had to be
confusing for people.

39:03.863 --> 39:05.691
- No, no. They knew
the difference.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.823
- Especially Carlyle.

39:07.867 --> 39:09.782
- Helema. Oh [nervous laugh]...

39:09.825 --> 39:11.740
It sounds like you know
the book quite well.

39:11.784 --> 39:13.002
Did you study it?

39:13.655 --> 39:15.614
- Oh, no. I, uh...

39:16.092 --> 39:18.704
- Well, then how do you
know so much about it?

39:19.444 --> 39:21.576
- Well, I dated the author.

39:22.447 --> 39:25.493
Yeah. He would run things
by me, and you know...

39:27.452 --> 39:29.192
Well, I date a lot
of powerful men.

39:29.236 --> 39:31.020
I think you all know that.

39:31.804 --> 39:34.894
Look, come on. Let me take
you on a trip, ladies.

39:35.677 --> 39:37.592
A trip through the phone.

39:38.550 --> 39:43.555
So, here is, uh, James
Harden and I in Italy.

39:44.817 --> 39:48.124
Yeah, they don't call him
Harden for nothing. [laughs]

39:49.604 --> 39:51.998
Uh, and this is Gronkowski.

39:52.041 --> 39:54.783
You may know him as Gronk.

39:55.131 --> 39:57.438
Mm hm. Yeah, that's
the sound you make.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.701
And, uh, that's us in Tunisia.

39:59.745 --> 40:00.659
- Oh, my.

40:00.702 --> 40:03.096
- Yeah. And uh, here we have--

40:03.139 --> 40:04.489
- Oh, w-w-wait. Go back.

40:04.532 --> 40:05.228
- Mm hm?

40:05.272 --> 40:06.229
- Who's that?

40:06.273 --> 40:07.840
- Oh.

40:07.883 --> 40:09.581
- That's, uh, that's Adrian
Peterson, the football player.

40:09.624 --> 40:12.888
- Yeah, you're on
your game. That is AP.

40:12.932 --> 40:14.977
- Wait, wait. You dated him?

40:16.631 --> 40:18.590
- Well, we're friends.

40:18.633 --> 40:20.156
- You know what that means.

40:20.809 --> 40:23.638
- Hold it. You have a
category called Snakes?

40:24.900 --> 40:26.467
- Oh. [gasping]

40:28.077 --> 40:29.470
[Roxanne coughs]

40:31.777 --> 40:33.126
- Is that real?

40:33.169 --> 40:34.606
- Oh, very.

40:34.997 --> 40:36.999
- Who, who are those guys?

40:37.043 --> 40:38.087
- Friends.

40:38.131 --> 40:40.438
- Why can't we see their faces?

40:40.960 --> 40:41.743
- What for?

40:41.787 --> 40:43.136
- Mom, stop looking.

40:43.658 --> 40:47.488
- Ooh, wait, is
that one crooked?

40:48.054 --> 40:49.490
[audience laughs]

40:50.273 --> 40:52.493
- If I told you
who that one was,

40:52.537 --> 40:55.757
the paparazzi would be
swarming this place.

40:56.541 --> 40:57.367
Yeah.

40:57.411 --> 40:58.760
- Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.

40:58.804 --> 41:00.762
Is that a sexting message
that just came in?

41:00.806 --> 41:02.677
- Wha, what you mean like...

41:03.243 --> 41:05.201
s-sex through texting?

41:05.245 --> 41:06.202
I mean, I don't understand.

41:06.246 --> 41:07.203
How do you, how do you do that?

41:07.247 --> 41:08.901
How does that work out?

41:10.250 --> 41:11.599
Ooh, I see.

41:11.643 --> 41:14.559
Oh, you match the words
with the picture. Mm hm.

41:15.124 --> 41:16.822
- Well, aren't
you gonna respond?

41:17.562 --> 41:19.781
- Ugh. Well, you
know, this is Tim.

41:19.825 --> 41:22.784
And he does this every
so often to rile me up,

41:22.828 --> 41:24.220
but I'm just so over it.

41:24.264 --> 41:26.092
You know, we've never
even met in person.

41:26.135 --> 41:27.833
- What? [stammers] What?

41:28.181 --> 41:29.704
- So we started
seeing each other

41:29.748 --> 41:31.793
when I sent him a text that
was meant for someone else.

41:31.837 --> 41:33.969
And uh, then we just kept
talking through texts,

41:34.013 --> 41:35.797
and then he cheated on
me when he sent me a text

41:35.841 --> 41:37.625
that was meant
for another woman.

41:37.669 --> 41:40.759
So, I dumped his
butt with a text.

41:41.760 --> 41:42.978
- You see, Mrs.
Charles, you can have

41:43.022 --> 41:45.111
a full-blown relationship
through texts.

41:45.154 --> 41:46.634
- Well, I'll be.

41:46.678 --> 41:48.636
- I'm just happy you can't
get pregnant through a text.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.203
- Well, you'll find a way.

41:51.160 --> 41:52.292
[phone rings]

41:53.249 --> 41:54.512
- Excuse me.

41:54.990 --> 41:56.035
Hello?

41:56.818 --> 41:58.907
Oh! He finished the whole thing?

41:59.604 --> 42:02.171
My baby is so smart.

42:03.869 --> 42:05.653
Oh, he can have
the whole cookie.

42:05.697 --> 42:06.741
Mm hm.

42:07.046 --> 42:07.960
Uh-huh.

42:08.003 --> 42:09.701
Okay. All right. Okay.

42:09.744 --> 42:12.094
Okay. Bye, Donna. Thank you.

42:12.617 --> 42:14.096
Sorry, that was the sitter.

42:14.619 --> 42:17.709
- You have a son?
That's, that's wonderful.

42:17.752 --> 42:20.189
- It is, isn't it? Yes.

42:20.233 --> 42:22.191
That's part of the
reason I'm back in town,

42:22.235 --> 42:23.715
to introduce him.

42:23.758 --> 42:25.847
- Oh, well, why
didn't you bring him

42:25.891 --> 42:27.545
if you wanted to introduce him?

42:28.067 --> 42:30.896
- Well, I didn't know if
his father would be here.

42:30.939 --> 42:32.288
- [Bunny] Oh, is his fatherr--

42:32.332 --> 42:35.770
- [Roxanne] Oh, my goodness!

42:37.206 --> 42:38.904
Carlyle, what happened?

42:39.382 --> 42:41.254
- I was practicing my
swing, and accidentally,

42:41.297 --> 42:42.298
the golf club slipped
out of my hand,

42:42.342 --> 42:43.865
and hit Carlyle in the knee.

42:43.909 --> 42:45.214
- Yeah, 'cause of them greasy
fries you was eatin', man.

42:45.258 --> 42:47.390
- Hey, man, those
garlic fries are good--

42:47.434 --> 42:49.784
- Oh, come on, you,
take him over there.

42:49.828 --> 42:51.046
Are you gonna be okay?

42:51.090 --> 42:52.744
- [Carlyle] Yeah,
yeah. I barely felt it.

42:54.093 --> 42:55.573
Helema?

42:56.051 --> 42:57.618
- Hello, Carlyle.

42:58.184 --> 43:00.055
- Uh, Bunny, you didn't
tell me that she was coming.

43:00.099 --> 43:01.709
- I didn't know. I didn't know.

43:01.753 --> 43:03.232
- I invited her, Carlyle.

43:03.929 --> 43:06.235
- And I'm so glad she did.

43:07.106 --> 43:08.716
- For what?

43:10.936 --> 43:12.720
- To introduce you to your son.

43:12.764 --> 43:14.069
- [Audience] Ooh...

43:16.332 --> 43:17.856
- My what?

43:19.684 --> 43:20.772
My son.

43:24.340 --> 43:26.081
Is, is this...

43:26.125 --> 43:27.300
this one of your little
tricks, to get me,

43:27.343 --> 43:28.954
get back in my life?

43:31.696 --> 43:34.133
Helema, how the hell
can you j-just broadcast

43:34.176 --> 43:35.613
somethin' like that on somebody?

43:35.656 --> 43:37.789
Y-You supposed to brace somebody
for somethin' like this.

43:37.832 --> 43:39.660
W-Were you all just talkin'
about it before I came in?

43:39.704 --> 43:40.705
- [All] No, no.

43:40.748 --> 43:42.794
[overlapped talking]

43:48.408 --> 43:49.844
- Listen.

43:51.150 --> 43:55.197
I think we need a
private conversation.

43:55.241 --> 43:58.200
It's a little crowded here.

43:59.114 --> 44:00.115
So...

44:03.162 --> 44:06.818
This is the number

44:06.861 --> 44:10.735
and address where I'm staying.

44:16.392 --> 44:17.393
And um...

44:19.221 --> 44:20.919
call me tomorrow.

44:22.137 --> 44:25.967
And thank Mrs. Charles and
Bunny for the catch-up.

44:29.188 --> 44:30.668
Bye, boos!

44:33.758 --> 44:34.715
[door closes]

44:34.759 --> 44:36.021
- I need to lay down.

44:37.370 --> 44:38.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks.

44:39.024 --> 44:42.027
- Well, that was an
interesting book club meeting.

44:43.028 --> 44:44.856
I think Christopher
will be picking me up

44:44.899 --> 44:46.292
sooner than expected.

44:46.335 --> 44:47.728
- Wait, wait, wait.

44:47.772 --> 44:49.469
I-I thought your
husband's name is Eugene.

44:49.512 --> 44:51.166
- It was. I mean, it--

44:51.210 --> 44:52.211
- It is.

44:55.040 --> 44:56.955
Christopher is my driver.

44:56.998 --> 44:58.130
- Oh.

45:03.048 --> 45:04.397
- Hey, uh, Lavanya,
if you don't mind,

45:04.440 --> 45:06.094
I can, uh, give you a ride home.

45:06.138 --> 45:07.226
- No, I'm good, Monte.

45:07.269 --> 45:09.054
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.

45:09.097 --> 45:10.185
- W-Well, the least
you could do is let me

45:10.229 --> 45:11.752
stand outside with you.

45:11.796 --> 45:13.058
Can't have a pretty lady like
yourself standin' outside

45:13.101 --> 45:14.712
waiting alone for a ride.

45:15.364 --> 45:16.365
- Okay.
- [Monte] Great.

45:16.409 --> 45:17.802
- Goodbye, everyone.

45:18.498 --> 45:19.804
- [Rona] Bye.

45:21.327 --> 45:23.459
Brittany, Brittany, Brittany.

45:23.503 --> 45:25.026
As smart as you think you are,

45:25.070 --> 45:28.160
you can do and say some
very, very dumb things.

45:28.203 --> 45:30.728
- I know. I-I wasn't thinking,

45:31.816 --> 45:33.034
Mrs. Charles, is she okay.

45:33.078 --> 45:34.340
- Yeah, yeah. She's, she's okay.

45:34.383 --> 45:36.211
She just needs to
be alone a sec.

45:36.864 --> 45:39.127
- Mrs. Charles, is she
in love with Carlyle?

45:42.087 --> 45:43.566
- I ain't gonna say nothin'.

45:43.610 --> 45:45.090
- Boy, help me get
some of this stuff.

45:45.133 --> 45:46.918
Get it together, and help
me get it down to the car.

45:46.961 --> 45:48.223
- I ain't gonna say nothin'.

45:48.267 --> 45:50.573
- Chapter nine, "Men
Talk More Than Women".

45:50.617 --> 45:51.966
- That is true.

46:00.409 --> 46:01.759
- He's cute.

46:02.107 --> 46:05.240
- Humph. He's a little
too old for you, though.

46:05.850 --> 46:07.155
- You really have me confused.

46:07.199 --> 46:08.243
- What?

46:08.287 --> 46:10.898
You date young black men.

46:11.899 --> 46:14.815
- And it seems, by your little
sidebar comments all night,

46:14.859 --> 46:16.469
that you have a
problem with that.

46:17.122 --> 46:18.384
Or at least with me.

46:18.906 --> 46:19.951
- No.

46:20.473 --> 46:22.997
I have a problem
with all of you.

46:23.868 --> 46:24.390
- Who?

46:24.433 --> 46:25.565
- Asian women.

46:26.131 --> 46:27.959
- You can't be serious.

46:28.437 --> 46:30.091
- Very.

46:30.135 --> 46:33.529
My father left my mother for
an Asian woman, all right?

46:34.139 --> 46:36.837
He left and had
four other children.

46:36.881 --> 46:38.578
- What does that
have to do with me?

46:38.621 --> 46:40.841
- Well, I don't know
too many of you, okay?

46:40.885 --> 46:43.148
So, I'm using you
as a representative

46:43.191 --> 46:45.237
to curse all of you all out!

46:45.280 --> 46:48.936
- Wow. You sound like a bunch
of girls in my neighborhood.

46:48.980 --> 46:50.982
- [laughs scornfully]
You're neighborhood?

46:51.025 --> 46:52.287
- [Meho] Yeah.
- Please.

46:52.331 --> 46:54.463
- Look. I grew up in Bankhead.

46:55.595 --> 46:57.292
You'd never know what
it's like to be Vietnamese

46:57.336 --> 46:58.903
and be called Chinese,

46:59.338 --> 47:02.515
'cause people are too
lazy to ask. Okay?

47:03.646 --> 47:06.562
And then the Chinese
people, pissed at you,

47:06.606 --> 47:09.827
because how dare people
mistake you for Chinese.

47:10.958 --> 47:13.004
You see, Rona, my mother...

47:14.266 --> 47:17.573
went to the States when we
were chased out of Vietnam.

47:17.617 --> 47:21.186
The government put my people
up in black communities.

47:21.229 --> 47:24.885
So that the white folks
wouldn't have to deal with us.

47:25.930 --> 47:27.061
They gave us a
little bit of money,

47:27.105 --> 47:28.323
to open up our stores,

47:28.367 --> 47:31.196
for retribution for
blowing up our country.

47:32.023 --> 47:33.502
But what they didn't tell us

47:33.546 --> 47:36.027
is that it would piss
the black people off

47:36.070 --> 47:38.551
because y'all was still
tryin' to get your share.

47:38.594 --> 47:40.379
And every day,

47:40.988 --> 47:44.165
I had to pay for being
given your share.

47:45.688 --> 47:47.952
We didn't know what you
all had been through here.

47:49.040 --> 47:51.216
Nor do we ask to be scapegoats

47:52.957 --> 47:55.046
so they can find
someone to blame.

47:58.005 --> 48:01.095
The white girls would
call me the black girl

48:01.574 --> 48:02.705
with chinky eyes.

48:02.749 --> 48:04.359
And then the black
girls would tease me

48:04.403 --> 48:06.361
because my hair was different.

48:06.971 --> 48:08.363
But then the black
girls figured,

48:08.407 --> 48:11.018
"Hey, she's not going
anywhere no time soon."

48:11.062 --> 48:13.020
So, they became my friends.

48:14.413 --> 48:16.894
Sounding hip doesn't
make you black, Rona.

48:18.983 --> 48:20.636
I just did what my friends did.

48:20.680 --> 48:23.161
I grew up an American.

48:24.423 --> 48:26.033
I didn't know nothin' else.

48:27.295 --> 48:30.516
I was just a little American
girl with chinky eyes.

48:31.560 --> 48:35.347
So, at the end of the
day, I'm a woman first.

48:35.695 --> 48:40.221
So, my womanly needs
outweigh my ethics on race.

48:40.265 --> 48:41.527
Tell Bunny I said bye.

48:41.570 --> 48:43.398
[audience clapping and cheering]

48:44.617 --> 48:45.966
- Oh, whoa, hey.

48:46.010 --> 48:47.185
- [Meho] Hey.
[indistinct conversation]

48:47.228 --> 48:50.101
- No, I'm not. Tell
Bunny I'ma call her.

48:50.797 --> 48:52.059
- Okay.

48:52.755 --> 48:54.453
- Excuse me. Let
me get that for ya.

48:54.496 --> 48:55.976
- [Rona] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

48:56.455 --> 48:57.456
- [Monte] What's up, ma'am?

48:58.065 --> 48:58.631
- [Brittany] Hey, guys.

48:58.674 --> 48:59.980
- [Monte] Hey.

49:00.024 --> 49:00.981
- All right. Um...

49:01.025 --> 49:03.201
Looks like I'm all done here.

49:03.244 --> 49:04.680
Um, I'll be going.

49:04.724 --> 49:06.073
- Take care of
yourself, girl-girl.

49:06.117 --> 49:07.683
- [Brittany] Oh, will do.
- All right.

49:07.727 --> 49:09.120
- Toodles.

49:09.729 --> 49:11.383
- She been takin' care
of herself, all right.

49:11.426 --> 49:13.298
- Yo, hey, she had a bunch
of shorties up in here, man.

49:13.341 --> 49:14.255
- Man, it's crazy.

49:14.299 --> 49:15.387
- Gettin' the drink on.

49:16.083 --> 49:17.432
- Need to come more often, man.

49:17.476 --> 49:19.478
- Got us a little brew,
somethin' up here.

49:19.521 --> 49:21.175
Give me some wine.
- [Monte] Yeah. I had a beer.

49:21.219 --> 49:23.047
- [Geez] Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

49:23.090 --> 49:24.222
You all right, man?

49:24.265 --> 49:25.658
- Yeah, you hit me
real good, though.

49:25.701 --> 49:27.094
- Let me get you some ice.
Have a seat there, brah.

49:27.138 --> 49:28.704
- Well, you soft?

49:28.748 --> 49:29.967
- What?

49:30.663 --> 49:32.143
- It wasn't that bad.

49:32.186 --> 49:34.275
- Damn garlic french fries
almost took my leg off.

49:34.319 --> 49:35.494
[laughing]

49:37.104 --> 49:39.280
On the knee, on the
knee, on the knee.

49:39.324 --> 49:40.934
- I'm sorry there, bud.

49:40.978 --> 49:44.677
Yeah, Monte went to walk that
fine-assed Lavanya downstairs,

49:44.720 --> 49:48.594
and I went to walk
that fine-assed Mrs.
Charles downstairs.

49:48.637 --> 49:49.638
- Chill, man.

49:49.682 --> 49:51.292
[chuckling]

49:52.641 --> 49:56.080
- Yo, man, is she like a, a,
a chain-smoker, or somethin'?

49:56.558 --> 49:57.646
- Who, Mrs. Charles?
- [Geez] Yeah.

49:57.690 --> 49:59.344
- Oh, no. She better
not be smokin'.

50:00.606 --> 50:02.434
I mean, she had a, she had a

50:02.477 --> 50:03.783
cancer scare last year.

50:03.826 --> 50:05.263
Why you ask?

50:05.306 --> 50:06.742
- Damn. I mean, 'cause when
I went down to the car,

50:06.786 --> 50:08.309
you know, I went in the trunk
to put the stuff in there,

50:08.353 --> 50:10.311
I moved a few things
around and she had, like,

50:10.355 --> 50:12.139
three cartons of cigarettes
sittin' up in there.

50:12.183 --> 50:14.620
Like, like she was, like, tryin'
to hide 'em, or somethin'.

50:14.663 --> 50:16.056
- What'd she say
when you saw 'em?

50:16.100 --> 50:17.492
- She was inside of the
car. She didn't see me.

50:17.536 --> 50:19.451
- Oh, man, well...

50:20.278 --> 50:21.757
I hope she ain't smokin'.

50:22.323 --> 50:25.370
I mean, she, she's been
havin' complications.

50:26.110 --> 50:28.329
Always coughin',
pain in her chest.

50:28.373 --> 50:29.417
They did a bunch
of tests on her,

50:29.461 --> 50:31.550
and they found that she had a...

50:31.593 --> 50:34.335
a mass on her lungs,
or somethin' like that.

50:34.379 --> 50:36.076
The doctors removed it.

50:36.120 --> 50:37.599
The procedure was a success.

50:37.643 --> 50:39.253
And they even got
her into therapy,

50:39.297 --> 50:41.081
to help her quit smokin'.

50:41.125 --> 50:43.692
And she assured us, promised
us, that she stopped.

50:44.476 --> 50:45.825
Bunny ain't gonna take to that.

50:45.868 --> 50:47.696
- For sure.
- [Geez] No.

50:47.740 --> 50:48.697
- That's messed up.

50:48.741 --> 50:50.351
Speaking of Bunny, man, you, uh,

50:50.395 --> 50:52.136
you think she mad
at you for that?

50:55.487 --> 50:57.576
- More disappinted
than mad, I guess.

50:58.316 --> 50:59.578
You know what I mean?

51:00.274 --> 51:01.797
I was irresponsible to someone

51:01.841 --> 51:03.799
who wasn't 100%
for me, you know?

51:03.843 --> 51:05.192
- Yeah.

51:05.236 --> 51:06.541
Dude, you ever
fantasize about Bunny?

51:06.585 --> 51:08.369
Like, you know, when
you with somebody else?

51:08.413 --> 51:09.849
- No. What's wrong
with you, man?

51:09.892 --> 51:10.458
- [Geez] You don't?

51:10.502 --> 51:11.242
- No!

51:11.285 --> 51:12.721
- I do. [laughis]

51:13.505 --> 51:15.289
- You got problems.
You got problems.

51:15.333 --> 51:16.769
[laughing]

51:17.248 --> 51:20.251
- You know, there was this
chapter in the book, right?

51:20.294 --> 51:21.252
They talked about---

51:21.295 --> 51:22.122
- [laughs] Wait a minute.

51:22.166 --> 51:23.558
- Did you say "book"?

51:23.602 --> 51:25.038
Did he just say book?
- [Monte] You read the book?

51:25.082 --> 51:26.126
- Yeah, I read the book.
What's wrong with you guys?

51:26.170 --> 51:27.649
- Uh-huh.
- [Monte] All right.

51:27.693 --> 51:28.737
- It was layin' around, she
suggested that I read it.

51:28.781 --> 51:30.174
So I read it because I read.

51:30.217 --> 51:31.610
- [Monte and Geez] Okay. Uh-huh.

51:31.653 --> 51:32.698
- Anyway, there was this
chapter in the book called

51:32.741 --> 51:34.743
"Can Men and Women be Friends".

51:34.787 --> 51:36.267
And there were a
series of questions

51:36.310 --> 51:37.746
at the end of the chapter
that I just couldn't

51:37.790 --> 51:39.270
bring myself around to answer.

51:39.313 --> 51:40.488
- Why not?

51:41.272 --> 51:43.274
- Because they would
determine if you were...

51:43.317 --> 51:44.710
[laughing]

51:45.493 --> 51:46.494
You guys are asses.

51:46.538 --> 51:48.017
[laughing]
You guys are asses.

51:48.061 --> 51:51.456
- Yo, yo, no, no, nope, find
his book. Oh, there we go.

51:51.499 --> 51:53.327
- Tell you what.
- [Geez] Here we go.

51:53.371 --> 51:55.634
- I'm not playin'
your games, man.

51:55.677 --> 51:57.331
- Oh, oh, right
here, right here.

51:57.375 --> 51:58.419
- I'll keep score. Here we go.

51:58.463 --> 51:59.768
- All right. Uh...

51:59.812 --> 52:02.467
The list to see if you
are dating your friend.

52:03.207 --> 52:04.599
All right, let's see here. Um...

52:04.643 --> 52:05.731
Oh, here you go.

52:05.774 --> 52:06.906
Do you talk every day?

52:09.343 --> 52:11.650
- Mm. Yeah.

52:11.693 --> 52:12.738
- U-huh.
- [Monte] Of course.

52:12.781 --> 52:14.305
- Okay.

52:14.348 --> 52:16.133
Do you ever tell each other
when you're goin' on dates?

52:17.308 --> 52:18.787
- Nah. Not really.

52:18.831 --> 52:20.746
But you know, we do talk
about the ones we don't like.

52:20.789 --> 52:22.487
- Ah, see, see? Okay. Okay.

52:22.530 --> 52:24.750
When was the last time you
had a girl stay over here?

52:24.793 --> 52:26.665
- I ain't goin' to that spot.

52:27.927 --> 52:29.189
- All right.

52:29.233 --> 52:31.322
Does she prefer maxi
pads or tampons?

52:31.365 --> 52:32.627
- Maxi pads.

52:33.237 --> 52:34.325
- You answered that a
little too quick, brah.

52:34.368 --> 52:35.543
- Way too fast.

52:35.935 --> 52:38.198
- All right. The
last guy she dated?

52:39.243 --> 52:40.461
- What was his name?

52:40.505 --> 52:42.550
Jonah, or Ron, Mitch,
somethin' like that.

52:42.594 --> 52:44.683
Brought her daisies.
She, she allergic.

52:44.726 --> 52:45.858
But there was this one dude.

52:45.901 --> 52:50.819
His name was, um,
Rashid Kadhir Hassan X,

52:50.863 --> 52:52.212
or somehin' like that.

52:52.256 --> 52:54.345
He was a cool, down-to-earth
dude. You know?

52:54.388 --> 52:56.303
Knowledgable, respectful.

52:56.347 --> 52:57.783
I thought they could hit it off.

52:57.826 --> 52:58.827
- All right, all right.

52:58.871 --> 53:00.307
- What was, what
was the problem?

53:00.351 --> 53:01.526
- Oh, his four wives.

53:01.569 --> 53:03.658
- [Monte] Oh sh...[laughs]
- Oh, damn.

53:03.702 --> 53:04.877
All right. Let's
see whatcha got.

53:04.920 --> 53:07.358
- Okay. Two points
for each question.

53:07.401 --> 53:09.229
With a total of...

53:09.273 --> 53:10.796
- Mm. Mm.

53:10.839 --> 53:11.927
- What's it say?

53:12.450 --> 53:13.625
- Well, you're not datin'.

53:13.668 --> 53:14.930
- [Carlyle] Like a said.

53:14.974 --> 53:16.410
- [Both] You're married.

53:17.890 --> 53:19.326
- Ah, shit!

53:19.892 --> 53:20.980
[laughing]

53:29.641 --> 53:30.859
[phone rings]

53:31.730 --> 53:33.340
- [Bunny] [clears throat] Hello?

53:33.384 --> 53:35.037
- [Voiceover] It's
Lavanya, downstairs.

53:35.081 --> 53:36.604
Can you let me in?

53:36.648 --> 53:38.215
- Yeah, yeah.

53:43.829 --> 53:44.699
[intercom buzzes]

53:51.445 --> 53:52.577
[light knocking]

53:55.406 --> 53:56.711
Hi. [Lavanya sniffles]

53:56.755 --> 54:00.324
Oh my gosh. Van.

54:01.455 --> 54:03.022
What is goin' on?

54:05.329 --> 54:06.721
You, wait. Okay.

54:07.374 --> 54:08.506
Here, put your arm around me.

54:08.549 --> 54:09.898
- No. I know where the couch is.

54:09.942 --> 54:11.900
- You okay? Okay. All right.

54:11.944 --> 54:12.945
Where have you been?

54:12.988 --> 54:14.468
What is goin' on?

54:14.816 --> 54:16.557
- Um, I read that book.

54:16.601 --> 54:18.646
The book said go out, socialize,

54:18.690 --> 54:20.300
and meet people like you,

54:20.344 --> 54:21.562
so I went out.

54:21.606 --> 54:22.955
- Okay. Well, you know what?

54:22.998 --> 54:25.436
I think you might've
misinterpreted what

54:25.479 --> 54:27.307
the author was meaning.

54:27.351 --> 54:29.788
Everything isn't meant for
everybody, in that book.

54:30.832 --> 54:32.791
- I was just listening
to all the stuff you guys

54:32.834 --> 54:33.748
were talking about.

54:33.792 --> 54:35.924
You know, about connection,

54:35.968 --> 54:38.623
and havin' fun, and sex.

54:39.406 --> 54:40.842
- [Bunny] Okay.

54:40.886 --> 54:43.454
- So, I decided like, I
wanted to live. I feel dead.

54:43.497 --> 54:45.934
I felt like I was
dead, so I went out.

54:46.935 --> 54:48.023
And...

54:48.067 --> 54:50.591
You know, I started
thinking about

54:50.635 --> 54:53.638
what would Eugene say if he knew

54:53.681 --> 54:55.814
I was having these feelings.

54:57.381 --> 54:58.904
- What do you think?

54:58.947 --> 55:00.993
- You know, he
would say nothin'.

55:01.036 --> 55:02.908
He's dead, Bunny.

55:02.951 --> 55:05.127
He died two years ago.

55:05.171 --> 55:06.868
He's dead. It's okay. I said it.

55:06.912 --> 55:08.479
- Okay, Van. All right.

55:09.088 --> 55:11.046
- Listen. I know
what you guys do.

55:11.090 --> 55:12.483
I can see you do it.

55:12.526 --> 55:15.486
I know you do it because
you love me, you know?

55:15.529 --> 55:18.358
But I also see the way
you look at each other.

55:18.402 --> 55:19.881
I saw your mother's face.

55:20.491 --> 55:22.971
I see the way you look at each
other when I say his name.

55:24.016 --> 55:27.541
You don't want to upset
your widow friend.

55:27.585 --> 55:29.848
I know, but listen.

55:30.501 --> 55:32.981
I went out. I went out.

55:33.025 --> 55:35.810
I went to a bar,
and I met a guy.

55:35.854 --> 55:37.595
And I had drinks.

55:38.987 --> 55:41.555
And then, we went to a motel,

55:41.599 --> 55:43.514
and we had sex.

55:44.689 --> 55:46.038
Sex.

55:46.081 --> 55:48.997
And then, when it was
over, he gave me his card,

55:49.694 --> 55:50.869
and he left.

55:51.173 --> 55:53.393
Then, I went back
to that same bar,

55:53.437 --> 55:55.090
and I met another guy,

55:55.134 --> 55:57.136
and I went to another motel.

55:57.876 --> 55:59.399
I didn't want to get caught.

55:59.443 --> 56:02.402
And then, I had sex with him.

56:03.229 --> 56:07.929
And then I realized
that I'm still dead.

56:08.626 --> 56:10.758
I died with Eugene, Bunny.

56:10.802 --> 56:12.020
- No.

56:12.064 --> 56:15.415
- Yes. We collapsed on
that floor together,

56:15.459 --> 56:16.982
and we never came back.

56:17.025 --> 56:18.636
And you know, it's...

56:19.593 --> 56:21.987
it's hard because
he was everything.

56:22.030 --> 56:23.118
He did everything for me.

56:23.162 --> 56:24.424
He was all I knew.

56:24.468 --> 56:25.512
You know...

56:25.556 --> 56:27.122
him and my parents groomed me

56:27.166 --> 56:29.037
to be the perfect wife.

56:31.605 --> 56:34.869
And you know what happens
when the perfect husband dies?

56:34.913 --> 56:39.004
The perfect wife continues
on, like nothin' happened.

56:41.180 --> 56:42.660
And you know what?

56:42.703 --> 56:45.793
I thought I was gonna find
somethin' in those men.

56:45.837 --> 56:49.449
I thought I was gonna find
somethin' in that damn book.

56:50.929 --> 56:52.104
Nothin'.

56:53.105 --> 56:55.586
I don't even, I don't have kids,

56:56.543 --> 56:58.110
I don't have a career.

56:58.153 --> 57:00.025
I don't even have
a Facebook page.

57:00.068 --> 57:00.982
And you know what?

57:01.026 --> 57:03.028
I don't even know how to drive.

57:03.071 --> 57:05.030
- Oh, it's okay.

57:05.073 --> 57:06.423
It's okay.

57:07.119 --> 57:09.991
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

57:10.035 --> 57:14.474
- You know, I'm just,
I'm angry. So angry.

57:14.518 --> 57:17.738
I'm angry! 'Cause he
left me by myself.

57:17.782 --> 57:19.958
And I'm lonely,
and I see you guys,

57:20.001 --> 57:21.568
and you have fun,

57:21.612 --> 57:22.613
and you go on dates.

57:22.656 --> 57:24.092
And I'm just by myself.

57:24.136 --> 57:27.922
I'm walkin' around here
like a slave with no master,

57:27.966 --> 57:30.925
and I just feel bad. [sobbing]

57:31.796 --> 57:33.014
- I'm sorry.

57:34.538 --> 57:36.104
I'm so sorry.

57:36.975 --> 57:39.107
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

57:39.978 --> 57:41.893
I promise you.

57:42.720 --> 57:44.069
I'm your friend, okay?

57:44.112 --> 57:46.201
And I'm not gonna let you
go through this alone.

57:47.855 --> 57:48.943
All right?

57:48.987 --> 57:49.944
We're gonna get
you some therapy.

57:49.988 --> 57:51.337
We're gonna get you a counselor,

57:51.380 --> 57:53.034
and we're gonna get to
the bottom of everything.

57:53.078 --> 57:54.645
I promise you. Okay?

57:54.688 --> 57:57.125
But for now, I want you, I
need you to get some rest.

57:57.169 --> 57:59.127
- I need to learn how to drive.

57:59.171 --> 58:00.607
- Well, you're gonna do that.

58:00.651 --> 58:01.782
We gonna do, we're gonna
get you some driving lessons

58:01.826 --> 58:04.132
and some therapy, okay?

58:04.959 --> 58:06.657
Come on. Let me
take you to my room,

58:06.700 --> 58:07.571
so you can lay down.

58:07.614 --> 58:08.963
- Oh, no, no. I can go home.

58:09.007 --> 58:10.661
That's what I got
Christopher for.

58:10.704 --> 58:11.792
- No, are you kidding me?

58:11.836 --> 58:14.491
You are staying
here. Okay? Come on.

58:15.666 --> 58:17.232
- I'm gonna get up. Ready?

58:17.276 --> 58:19.583
- [Bunny] All right.
You got it? This way.

58:19.626 --> 58:21.106
- Of course, I've got it.

58:21.149 --> 58:22.281
- Oh, okay.

58:22.324 --> 58:23.804
Well, I'm just makin' sure,

58:23.848 --> 58:26.154
'cause you look a little
discombobulated right now.

58:26.198 --> 58:29.941
I'll get you some aspirin, and
some water. [Lavanya mumbles]

58:29.984 --> 58:32.117
I'll get, I'll get that.
Don't worry about it.

58:32.987 --> 58:34.119
This way.

58:34.162 --> 58:36.121
Got you out here all barefoot.

58:36.164 --> 58:37.775
[indistinct conversation]

58:41.169 --> 58:43.607
Call out if you
need anything, okay?

58:46.392 --> 58:47.001
- [Carlyle] Hey.

58:47.045 --> 58:48.220
- Hey.

58:48.263 --> 58:50.178
I'm sorry, did we wake you up?

58:50.701 --> 58:51.832
- Oh, no, no. I can't sleep.

58:51.876 --> 58:53.573
Not with this, not
with this throbbing.

58:53.617 --> 58:54.748
- [Bunny] Yeah.

58:54.792 --> 58:55.923
- And I need to get
some ice, anyway.

58:55.967 --> 58:58.883
- Okay, I was just
gonna get some aspirin.

58:59.710 --> 59:02.756
Oh, it's not there.
Where's the aspirin?

59:03.322 --> 59:06.238
I have to, okay, well, I'll
take her some water first.

59:18.119 --> 59:19.251
[clears throat]

59:21.949 --> 59:24.082
Um, I'm sorry about, um...

59:25.039 --> 59:26.650
Helema bein' here.

59:28.086 --> 59:29.696
I don't know how that
happened, honestly.

59:29.740 --> 59:31.306
I guess Brittany
emailed somebody--

59:31.350 --> 59:34.179
- Yeah, don't, don't even
worry about it. Okay?

59:34.222 --> 59:38.357
'Cause Helema went
the wrong way,

59:38.400 --> 59:40.794
totally the wrong way
with that. Period.

59:41.316 --> 59:42.579
- Yeah.

59:49.673 --> 59:51.370
- Are you disappointed in me?

59:56.680 --> 59:59.770
- Um, if I was 18...

01:00:01.293 --> 01:00:02.903
I would say yeah,

01:00:04.296 --> 01:00:05.950
but we're grown.

01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:11.259
I know you, I know you really
wanted it to work with her.

01:00:11.303 --> 01:00:13.000
I know you cared about her.

01:00:15.263 --> 01:00:18.397
Honestly, I'm sorry everything
worked out like this.

01:00:21.226 --> 01:00:22.227
[clears throat]

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:26.405
I want the best for you.

01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:28.363
I really do.

01:00:30.148 --> 01:00:31.279
- Thank you.

01:00:31.323 --> 01:00:32.977
That means a lot.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.809
You know, I feel
like she came here...

01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:42.203
I feel like she
came here with...

01:00:43.378 --> 01:00:45.685
the idea to just get up
under your skin. You know?

01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:48.383
Like, the way she
looks in your face,

01:00:48.427 --> 01:00:52.736
a-a-and smiles, a-and
tries to call you friend.

01:00:52.779 --> 01:00:54.868
It's as though she's just
always jealous of you.

01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:56.870
- I don't know why.

01:00:56.914 --> 01:00:58.480
I really don't get it because

01:00:58.524 --> 01:00:59.960
you two are the ones that dated,

01:01:00.004 --> 01:01:02.354
and I'm the one who hooked
you up freshman year.

01:01:02.397 --> 01:01:03.834
- That is right.

01:01:03.877 --> 01:01:04.922
- [Bunny] Right?

01:01:05.444 --> 01:01:06.837
- Lunch room.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.490
It was lunchtime
outside in the quad.

01:01:08.534 --> 01:01:09.840
- [Bunny] Yeah.

01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:12.973
- I don't know what
I saw in that girl.

01:01:13.017 --> 01:01:14.366
- She was hot.

01:01:15.193 --> 01:01:16.194
Don't get me wrong, though.

01:01:16.237 --> 01:01:17.717
I was hot, too.

01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:21.982
But [chuckles] I do kinda
remember what happened, though.

01:01:22.026 --> 01:01:25.072
She was really tryin'
to get with Mike Krump,

01:01:25.812 --> 01:01:27.292
freshman week.

01:01:27.335 --> 01:01:29.424
And so, I think he walked
by, and she called him over,

01:01:29.468 --> 01:01:31.862
and then she got
flirty, of course,

01:01:31.905 --> 01:01:33.994
and I don't know,
for whatever reason,

01:01:34.038 --> 01:01:34.952
you okay?

01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:36.475
- Yeah, yeah, it's just...

01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:40.348
- For whatever reason, he
wanted to talk to me, and--

01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:41.480
- [Carlyle] For whatever reason?

01:01:41.523 --> 01:01:42.873
- Yeah, I, whatever.
[Carlyle laughs]

01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:45.484
And she just was actin'
devastated and dramatic,

01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:47.138
and I felt guilty.

01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:48.792
And then, I saw you walk past.

01:01:48.835 --> 01:01:50.358
And I was like, "You know
what? Maybe I could just

01:01:50.402 --> 01:01:52.143
"hook her up with Carlyle."

01:01:52.186 --> 01:01:54.232
And that's pretty
much how it happened.

01:01:54.275 --> 01:01:55.450
I mean, we were lab partners,

01:01:55.494 --> 01:01:57.757
so I made up some story about--

01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:58.932
- Forgetting to
write your notes,

01:01:58.976 --> 01:02:00.194
which I thought
was suspect because

01:02:00.238 --> 01:02:02.153
everyone always goes
to you for notes.

01:02:02.936 --> 01:02:04.372
- [laughs] Right.

01:02:04.416 --> 01:02:07.462
And then, that was your
excuse to come to class,

01:02:07.506 --> 01:02:09.029
to see her pretty
much every day.

01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:10.465
- Well, I will always
appreciate that

01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:12.206
because when I was
there waiting for her,

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:14.513
acting like I wasn't
waiting for her,

01:02:14.556 --> 01:02:16.210
I got my homework done.

01:02:16.254 --> 01:02:19.387
- Oh, yeah. You
were always drawing.

01:02:19.431 --> 01:02:23.522
Like, that's why your butt got
in so much trouble in class

01:02:23.565 --> 01:02:25.219
'cause you were just
sketching all the time.

01:02:25.263 --> 01:02:26.873
Sketchin' away.

01:02:27.439 --> 01:02:29.528
But, I mean, you know,
it worked out, so...

01:02:30.398 --> 01:02:32.139
Thank goodness. [laughs]

01:02:32.879 --> 01:02:33.793
- Yeah.

01:02:33.837 --> 01:02:35.099
- [Bunny] Yeah.

01:02:37.971 --> 01:02:39.277
- You know...

01:02:41.148 --> 01:02:44.108
You really helped me
through freshman year.

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:47.285
You were the first...

01:02:48.939 --> 01:02:50.375
first woman, other
than my mother,

01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:53.900
that I shared so
much of myself with.

01:02:55.293 --> 01:02:58.949
- And I have to say
that you're the only man

01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:01.952
that I've shared
certain things with

01:03:01.995 --> 01:03:04.302
that I never thought I
would share with anybody.

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:07.914
I appreciate your point of view.

01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:10.438
I need your point
of view. Thank you.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.313
Yeah. Oh, should I
thank Helema? [laughs]

01:03:15.356 --> 01:03:17.576
- I think we both
should. [laughs]

01:03:18.533 --> 01:03:21.406
I can't believe that girl
didn't give me no play

01:03:21.449 --> 01:03:23.016
until junior year.

01:03:23.451 --> 01:03:24.278
Crazy.

01:03:24.322 --> 01:03:26.019
- That's weird. [laughs]

01:03:27.194 --> 01:03:28.326
I don't...

01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:31.633
I don't get that
girl. I really don't.

01:03:31.677 --> 01:03:33.418
- [Carlyle] Oh, you and me both.

01:03:33.461 --> 01:03:34.636
- I don't get her.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.637
I just, I couldn't stand
how people called us

01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:37.117
"the two Helemas".

01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:38.466
'Cause we were so different.

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:41.382
I had to nip that in
the bud. I really did.

01:03:41.426 --> 01:03:43.254
[laughs] I couldn't have that.

01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:44.342
And what...

01:03:44.951 --> 01:03:46.387
And what's really weird is that

01:03:46.431 --> 01:03:48.433
I didn't get with Mike
because she liked him so much.

01:03:48.476 --> 01:03:50.130
I didn't want to
hurt her feelings.

01:03:50.565 --> 01:03:52.132
- Wow.

01:03:52.176 --> 01:03:54.874
Man, this competition thing
sat with her for a while.

01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:56.093
- I really don't know
why 'cause, I mean,

01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:57.529
she still slept with him.

01:03:58.095 --> 01:03:58.965
- Really?

01:03:59.009 --> 01:03:59.705
- You didn't know that?

01:03:59.748 --> 01:04:00.967
- I didn't know that.

01:04:01.011 --> 01:04:02.055
You see, that's the
problem with her.

01:04:02.099 --> 01:04:03.927
She's always
chasin' the hot guy.

01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:05.667
Isn't there a
chapter in the book

01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:08.409
about always wanting
what everybody else has?

01:04:08.453 --> 01:04:09.933
- You've been readin' the book.

01:04:09.976 --> 01:04:12.370
You learned a little somethin'
somethin' from the book.

01:04:12.413 --> 01:04:13.937
How about it?

01:04:14.633 --> 01:04:16.069
[laughs] That's funny.

01:04:16.113 --> 01:04:17.244
But you were a hot guy.
What are you talkin' about?

01:04:17.288 --> 01:04:18.985
- Oh, please.

01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:20.552
What are you talkin' about?

01:04:20.595 --> 01:04:22.510
I wasn't a baller, I didn't
have no money. I was broke.

01:04:22.554 --> 01:04:23.903
- Oh, true.

01:04:23.947 --> 01:04:25.209
- What do you mean by true?

01:04:26.036 --> 01:04:27.167
- You know you was broke.

01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:28.690
[laughing]

01:04:28.734 --> 01:04:30.170
A little broke.

01:04:30.605 --> 01:04:33.130
But, no, you were definitely
one of the hot guys.

01:04:33.173 --> 01:04:36.002
I mean, you have your
athletic hot guys,

01:04:36.046 --> 01:04:37.351
and then you have
your flashy hot guys,

01:04:37.395 --> 01:04:39.658
and then you have you.

01:04:40.398 --> 01:04:41.921
And you're just handsome,

01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:45.577
and intelligent, and
cool, and different.

01:04:46.621 --> 01:04:48.362
All of the guys in your crew.

01:04:48.406 --> 01:04:50.495
Y'all were just some cool dudes.

01:04:50.538 --> 01:04:52.105
You guys weren't in a frat,

01:04:52.149 --> 01:04:54.368
but remember you chartered
your own organization?

01:04:54.412 --> 01:04:57.937
And then the frat guys joined
your organization. [laughs]

01:04:57.981 --> 01:05:00.635
- Brothers! To
infinity! [laughs]

01:05:02.724 --> 01:05:04.030
- Wow.

01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:05.249
- You know, I still
talk to Jason and Rob.

01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:06.946
As you can see, I
still hang with Monte.

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:09.079
- Yeah, y'all had some
of the livest parties.

01:05:09.122 --> 01:05:10.602
- [Carlyle] Yeah, yeah.

01:05:10.645 --> 01:05:12.517
- And remember, you still
had time to involve yourself

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.649
in community work,
and social work.

01:05:14.693 --> 01:05:16.129
I don't know how you did it.

01:05:16.173 --> 01:05:18.523
And the, the Frederick
Douglas statue.

01:05:18.566 --> 01:05:20.307
That really wouldn't be
there, if it wasn't for you.

01:05:20.351 --> 01:05:21.961
You had a lot to do with that.

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:23.180
We were at that all-white school

01:05:23.223 --> 01:05:25.051
with the 40% black
enrollment, and then--

01:05:25.095 --> 01:05:27.010
- And they had all these
statues of white figures,

01:05:27.053 --> 01:05:27.967
and no blacks.

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:29.012
That doesn't work.

01:05:29.055 --> 01:05:30.100
- [Bunny] Right.

01:05:30.143 --> 01:05:31.405
- Had to do
somethin' about that.

01:05:31.449 --> 01:05:32.972
- And that's what you
did. You took a stand.

01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:35.061
You made a stand, and that's
what women are attracted to.

01:05:35.105 --> 01:05:36.410
Trust me.

01:05:36.454 --> 01:05:38.021
You were a hot guy.

01:05:38.717 --> 01:05:39.674
- Well, thanks a lot.

01:05:39.718 --> 01:05:42.199
I never looked at it that way.

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:44.723
That's why I love you, girl.

01:05:45.593 --> 01:05:47.030
- I love you, too.

01:05:47.552 --> 01:05:49.336
I really do.

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:06.179
[doorbell ringing]

01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:11.141
- Now, who the hell
buzzin' my house?

01:06:16.102 --> 01:06:17.364
[intercom buzzes] Hello.

01:06:18.061 --> 01:06:19.279
- [Voiceover] Oh. Hi, Carlyle.

01:06:19.323 --> 01:06:20.715
It's Mrs. Charles.

01:06:20.759 --> 01:06:22.630
- Hey, Mrs. Charles. Come on up.

01:06:25.677 --> 01:06:27.026
[knocking]

01:06:28.854 --> 01:06:30.464
Hey, how you doin'? Come on in.

01:06:30.508 --> 01:06:32.162
- Good afternoon.

01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:34.425
I don't want to disturb you,

01:06:34.468 --> 01:06:35.556
but I'm just bringin'
back those bowls

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.470
I took home yesterday.

01:06:36.514 --> 01:06:37.645
I told Bunny I'd drop 'em by.

01:06:37.689 --> 01:06:39.038
I'll just be a sec.

01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:40.344
- Yeah, no problem.

01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:44.435
Mrs. Charles, when was
the last time we talked?

01:06:44.739 --> 01:06:45.610
- Yesterday.

01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:47.220
- No, I mean, you know...

01:06:47.264 --> 01:06:48.308
talked talked.

01:06:48.787 --> 01:06:49.831
- You need to borrow some money?

01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:51.137
- [laughs] No, no, no, no.

01:06:51.181 --> 01:06:53.357
I just wanna know how
my play mama's doin'.

01:06:54.184 --> 01:06:56.490
- That is so sweet of you.

01:06:56.534 --> 01:06:58.666
Well, hey. I'm doin' fine.

01:06:59.406 --> 01:07:01.626
I mean, things
couldn't be better.

01:07:01.669 --> 01:07:03.193
- [Carlyle] Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:07:03.236 --> 01:07:04.672
How are you?

01:07:04.716 --> 01:07:07.197
- Well, now that I know
what a golf ball feels like,

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.328
I'm great.

01:07:08.372 --> 01:07:09.764
Can't wait to start work.

01:07:09.808 --> 01:07:12.071
- Oh, it must be a very good job

01:07:12.115 --> 01:07:14.073
for you to leave my
baby daughter here

01:07:14.117 --> 01:07:15.509
all alone by herself.

01:07:15.553 --> 01:07:17.555
- If I knew that
Bunny needed me,

01:07:17.598 --> 01:07:19.426
I would never leave her alone.

01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:21.385
And yes, it's an awesome job.

01:07:21.776 --> 01:07:23.300
You know, I'll be
creating a new video game

01:07:23.343 --> 01:07:24.518
for the next two years.

01:07:24.562 --> 01:07:27.782
And they put a bunch
of really, really great

01:07:27.826 --> 01:07:29.784
graphic designers together,
and I'm just so honored

01:07:29.828 --> 01:07:31.525
that they considered
me one of 'em.

01:07:31.569 --> 01:07:34.528
Especially, freelancing for
the last five long years.

01:07:34.572 --> 01:07:37.314
- Oh, wow. You deserve it.

01:07:37.357 --> 01:07:38.663
- Well, thank you.

01:07:38.706 --> 01:07:40.230
Well, you look great.

01:07:41.448 --> 01:07:43.537
I mean, you enjoying retirement?

01:07:43.581 --> 01:07:46.410
- Oh, child! Am I? Oh, yeah.

01:07:46.453 --> 01:07:47.672
- You been by the
college lately?

01:07:47.715 --> 01:07:49.717
- Well, I wanna
go, but it's hard.

01:07:49.761 --> 01:07:51.110
You know, you see
those students,

01:07:51.154 --> 01:07:53.634
you want to come right
back out of retirement.

01:07:53.678 --> 01:07:56.724
But, oh, I just try to
keep up after Donovan,

01:07:56.768 --> 01:07:57.899
do what I can for Bunny,

01:07:57.943 --> 01:08:00.380
and I mentor a few
students at the Herald,

01:08:00.424 --> 01:08:02.861
but uh, for the most part,
you just find yourself alone

01:08:02.904 --> 01:08:04.558
just tryin' to find
somethin' to do.

01:08:04.602 --> 01:08:07.257
- Well, I'm sure you're
story's quite a testament

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.606
to those young ladies.

01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:11.435
- I don't share that with them.

01:08:11.478 --> 01:08:13.524
Only a few of the old ones know.

01:08:13.567 --> 01:08:14.786
Those girls, they look up to me.

01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:16.395
- Well, that's exactly
why you're, you're,

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:18.136
you're story's so important.

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.486
Life-saving.

01:08:21.358 --> 01:08:24.361
You know, I was so pissed
at my mom when she died.

01:08:25.752 --> 01:08:27.363
Her pride killed her.

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:30.758
You know, I vowed that...

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:33.587
I was gonna learn
everything about diabetes

01:08:33.631 --> 01:08:35.633
so that I wouldn't die from it.

01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:46.948
- You know, you are
still young, Carlyle.

01:08:46.992 --> 01:08:48.689
You don't understand.

01:08:48.733 --> 01:08:50.212
- I understand.

01:08:50.822 --> 01:08:53.694
I understand that bad habits
are made to be broken.

01:08:54.956 --> 01:08:56.697
Like when you were
a smoker. Okay?

01:08:56.741 --> 01:08:58.176
You realized...

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.701
You realized that you weren't
just hurtin' yourself,

01:09:00.745 --> 01:09:02.486
but you were
hurtin' your family.

01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:05.880
That was a rough time.

01:09:05.924 --> 01:09:07.491
- I remember, Carlyle.

01:09:07.533 --> 01:09:09.710
- We were, we were
all so worried

01:09:09.754 --> 01:09:11.277
when you went into the hospital.

01:09:11.321 --> 01:09:14.975
A-and, and Bunny,
she, she pulled back

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.413
on the store opening, and....

01:09:17.457 --> 01:09:20.895
Mr. Charles, he cancelled
all of his meetings overseas.

01:09:22.854 --> 01:09:24.247
He...

01:09:25.813 --> 01:09:27.772
He knew that there was
nothing more important

01:09:27.814 --> 01:09:29.469
than losing his wife.

01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:35.432
It's a blessing that the
family got through it.

01:09:36.911 --> 01:09:38.652
And just God forbid
if anything like that

01:09:38.696 --> 01:09:40.524
were to happen again.

01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:45.442
You are an amazing
woman, Mrs. Charles.

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:47.879
Cancer survivor.

01:09:49.707 --> 01:09:53.276
That is a story that those
young girls should hear.

01:09:56.627 --> 01:09:57.758
Hate to leave you out here,

01:09:57.802 --> 01:09:59.412
but I gotta go finish
gettin' dressed.

01:10:00.283 --> 01:10:01.458
- Stop.

01:10:03.503 --> 01:10:04.417
Go.

01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:07.507
I'll be all right.

01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:08.856
I'll let myself out.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.206
- All right.

01:10:26.526 --> 01:10:27.571
- Oh, lord.

01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:29.790
[audience claps]

01:10:29.834 --> 01:10:31.836
Oh. Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:32.967
What you doin' home so early?

01:10:33.011 --> 01:10:34.882
- Uh, my office
computer crashed,

01:10:34.926 --> 01:10:37.450
so I'm grabbin' my
laptop really quick.

01:10:37.494 --> 01:10:40.801
- Oh. Okay, I'll talk
to you later, okay?

01:10:40.845 --> 01:10:41.541
- Mom.

01:10:41.585 --> 01:10:42.716
- Huh?

01:10:43.369 --> 01:10:44.544
- You okay?

01:10:44.588 --> 01:10:46.764
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:48.374
I'm just...[sighs]

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:52.900
I'm just startin' to realize
how much I love your daddy,

01:10:52.944 --> 01:10:54.859
and how much I love you,

01:10:54.902 --> 01:10:58.515
and how much y'all love me.

01:10:59.907 --> 01:11:01.909
[smooches] I'll see ya later.

01:11:02.606 --> 01:11:03.607
- [Bunny] Okay.

01:11:04.042 --> 01:11:05.348
- [Roxanne] Oh, gosh.

01:11:05.391 --> 01:11:07.001
- [Bunny] Oh, Mom
[chuckles]. I love you.

01:11:08.046 --> 01:11:09.003
- Hey, Mrs. Charles...

01:11:09.047 --> 01:11:10.309
Oh, you're home early.

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:11.528
- Yeah.

01:11:11.571 --> 01:11:14.313
I, um, I've just gotta
grab a few things.

01:11:14.357 --> 01:11:15.923
Office computer crashed.

01:11:16.794 --> 01:11:17.925
- Yeah, okay.

01:11:18.926 --> 01:11:21.451
Yeah, um, Helema, she's
comin' by to talk.

01:11:21.973 --> 01:11:23.757
- Oh. Okay. Well, good.

01:11:23.801 --> 01:11:26.064
Uh, let me just, I'll
get a few things,

01:11:26.107 --> 01:11:28.588
then I'm just gonna get
out of your way, I guess.

01:11:30.503 --> 01:11:31.722
[doorbell rings]

01:11:31.765 --> 01:11:33.593
I'll get that, okay?
Let me just get that.

01:11:34.072 --> 01:11:36.074
[intercom buzzes] Hello?

01:11:38.642 --> 01:11:39.860
Hello?

01:11:40.644 --> 01:11:42.298
- [Voiceover] It's Helema.

01:11:43.386 --> 01:11:45.649
- [clears thorat]
Hey, just one thing.

01:11:46.824 --> 01:11:48.347
Whatever you do,

01:11:48.391 --> 01:11:51.829
don't let emotions make
the decision for you, okay?

01:11:52.438 --> 01:11:53.918
Helema is who she is.

01:11:55.006 --> 01:11:56.877
She's never gonna change, okay?

01:11:56.921 --> 01:11:58.052
So...

01:11:59.445 --> 01:12:00.794
I should've let her
go freshman year.

01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:02.143
And I can't let her
affect me anymore,

01:12:02.187 --> 01:12:04.015
so I'm not, I'm
not gonna allow it.

01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:05.756
Just...

01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:08.933
- Bunny.

01:12:08.976 --> 01:12:09.847
- Yeah?

01:12:10.413 --> 01:12:11.588
[knocking]

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:22.860
- Oh. Bunny.

01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:25.863
Were you planning on being
here for this meeting?

01:12:26.559 --> 01:12:29.040
- No. No, you and
I have closure.

01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:31.695
- Ah. Since when?

01:12:32.609 --> 01:12:34.915
- Since now. Excuse me.

01:12:38.702 --> 01:12:41.531
- Carlyle, you look amazing!

01:12:41.574 --> 01:12:44.447
- Let's get to why
we're here. Okay?

01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:46.710
Is he mine?

01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:50.366
- You're not even gonna
offer me something to drink?

01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:52.933
Not even a glass of wine?

01:12:57.111 --> 01:12:58.896
- Red or white?

01:12:59.636 --> 01:13:01.464
- You forgot I like red.

01:13:02.943 --> 01:13:05.642
- Well, evidently, there's
a lot that I don't remember.

01:13:08.993 --> 01:13:10.560
- [sighs] Well...

01:13:11.735 --> 01:13:14.477
Yes. He's yours.

01:13:15.695 --> 01:13:17.567
And if you want
a paternity test,

01:13:18.132 --> 01:13:19.003
I'm fine with that.

01:13:19.046 --> 01:13:20.396
- Well, you're damn right.

01:13:20.831 --> 01:13:22.746
'Cause you kept dumpin'
me and comin' back,

01:13:23.181 --> 01:13:25.183
whenever you thought
whoever was better.

01:13:25.226 --> 01:13:26.532
And when you realized
that they weren't,

01:13:26.576 --> 01:13:28.012
you kept comin' back to me.

01:13:29.056 --> 01:13:30.971
- But you kept letting me back.

01:13:31.972 --> 01:13:33.931
- That's because that's
what I thought you did

01:13:33.974 --> 01:13:35.628
with people you love.

01:13:38.501 --> 01:13:40.459
- I had to learn that, too.

01:13:40.764 --> 01:13:43.070
See, Carlyle,

01:13:43.636 --> 01:13:44.594
when I found out I was pregnant,

01:13:44.637 --> 01:13:46.552
we were broken up.

01:13:46.596 --> 01:13:47.988
And you were going through
financial troubles,

01:13:48.032 --> 01:13:49.773
and then I moved, and...

01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:52.950
I mean, I could've had
the baby and not told you,

01:13:52.993 --> 01:13:55.518
but that wouldn't be fair.

01:13:56.606 --> 01:13:58.564
You're an amazing man.

01:13:58.608 --> 01:14:01.001
And then I saw baby
Carlyle, and I just,

01:14:01.045 --> 01:14:04.744
I knew I missed you, and
that you just needed time.

01:14:04.788 --> 01:14:07.225
- You figured that
I just needed time?

01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:08.922
- Well, yes.

01:14:08.966 --> 01:14:10.141
That's why this is
more than just about

01:14:10.184 --> 01:14:11.403
you being his father.

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:14.972
This is about me and you
having a clean slate,

01:14:16.103 --> 01:14:18.279
and starting our lives together,

01:14:18.323 --> 01:14:19.977
as a family.

01:14:23.763 --> 01:14:24.982
- You're kidding.

01:14:25.809 --> 01:14:27.245
- I"m serious.

01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:29.247
Being a mommy changes you.

01:14:31.336 --> 01:14:33.033
- So, what happens?

01:14:33.077 --> 01:14:34.687
What happens when
our son grows up,

01:14:34.731 --> 01:14:36.123
and he's on his own?

01:14:36.167 --> 01:14:39.475
Is that when the, the
old Helema returns?

01:14:39.997 --> 01:14:41.259
Is, is that how it works?

01:14:41.302 --> 01:14:42.956
- Carlyle...

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.005
by then, we'll have two or
three more baby Carlyles.

01:14:53.706 --> 01:14:56.840
- Dammit. Why now?

01:14:57.928 --> 01:14:59.669
Why now, Helema?

01:15:00.844 --> 01:15:02.280
- You did it, didn't you?

01:15:03.194 --> 01:15:04.674
- What?

01:15:05.849 --> 01:15:08.504
- You and Bunny. What else?

01:15:09.766 --> 01:15:11.289
- See, that...

01:15:11.332 --> 01:15:13.857
that's, that's always
a thing with you.

01:15:14.684 --> 01:15:16.860
It's always been
the thing with you.

01:15:17.861 --> 01:15:19.732
- Carlyle, I've always had you.

01:15:20.733 --> 01:15:23.301
And I can still have you.

01:15:24.694 --> 01:15:26.260
Think about it.

01:15:26.304 --> 01:15:31.309
You, me, and baby
Carlyle, together

01:15:31.962 --> 01:15:34.704
as one happy family.

01:15:34.747 --> 01:15:37.663
It's what you've always wanted.

01:15:42.233 --> 01:15:44.017
- What I've always wanted.

01:15:44.757 --> 01:15:45.889
- Mm-hm.

01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:49.849
- What about you?

01:15:49.893 --> 01:15:51.764
- It's what I want, too.

01:15:58.205 --> 01:16:00.643
- Who was a hot boy on campus?

01:16:04.168 --> 01:16:05.343
- Um, what?

01:16:05.386 --> 01:16:07.737
- Who was a hot boy,
when we were in school?

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:09.652
Who did you consider
the hot boy?

01:16:12.089 --> 01:16:13.133
- Um...

01:16:14.221 --> 01:16:15.048
Seriously?

01:16:15.092 --> 01:16:16.223
- Yeah.

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:18.748
- Um...

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.927
Mike Krump, Ace, um...

01:16:24.797 --> 01:16:25.972
Grant Elliot?

01:16:29.367 --> 01:16:32.196
- That's funny. That's
exactly what Bunny said.

01:16:35.242 --> 01:16:38.332
- So? Where do we stand?

01:16:41.684 --> 01:16:43.337
- I guess I'll see you later.

01:16:44.121 --> 01:16:47.994
- Why see me later when
you can see me now,

01:16:48.038 --> 01:16:49.430
in your room?

01:16:50.388 --> 01:16:51.781
- I think it will be better
when the judge is there

01:16:51.824 --> 01:16:54.392
to tell me what my
parental rights are,

01:16:54.435 --> 01:16:57.003
my financial
obligations will be.

01:16:58.309 --> 01:17:00.093
- Carlyle, are you
seriously turning down

01:17:00.137 --> 01:17:02.139
everything I'm offering you?

01:17:03.009 --> 01:17:04.315
- Didn't ask for it.

01:17:04.358 --> 01:17:06.709
[audience clapping and cheering]

01:17:10.495 --> 01:17:11.975
- Uh, leave that.

01:17:12.018 --> 01:17:13.454
That belongs to me.

01:17:14.325 --> 01:17:17.110
If you say he is, and everything
in my tells me that he is,

01:17:17.154 --> 01:17:19.635
then you won't
mind me keepin' it.

01:17:20.461 --> 01:17:25.162
- Well, I guess I know where
your heart and your head lie.

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:28.731
- You know, that's
the problem with us.

01:17:30.167 --> 01:17:31.995
You don't, and never did.

01:17:33.518 --> 01:17:35.868
- [Helema] [sighs] Lame.

01:17:50.361 --> 01:17:55.061
[slow upbeat music]

01:17:56.541 --> 01:17:59.022
[audience clapping and cheering]

01:18:01.502 --> 01:18:03.461
- Oh, that was nice, everybody,

01:18:03.504 --> 01:18:05.898
but me and my husband,
we gonna call it a night.

01:18:07.204 --> 01:18:10.337
- It's getting late, so I'm
gonna be goin', as well.

01:18:10.381 --> 01:18:11.817
- You drivin' yet?

01:18:11.861 --> 01:18:13.906
- Oh no, I'm still
doin' my lessons,

01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:15.125
but in like in two
or three months,

01:18:15.168 --> 01:18:16.866
I will be downstairs,
beepin' the horn,

01:18:16.909 --> 01:18:18.302
comin' to pick you up.

01:18:18.345 --> 01:18:20.870
- Aww. I like that.
That's fantastic.

01:18:20.913 --> 01:18:23.873
- Until then, I've got
good ole Christopher.

01:18:23.916 --> 01:18:26.440
- All right. [laughs]
- [Lavanya] Love ya.

01:18:26.484 --> 01:18:27.964
- Love you, too.

01:18:28.007 --> 01:18:28.529
- Hey, Lavanya, I can, uh,
I can give you a ride home,

01:18:28.573 --> 01:18:29.835
if you need it.

01:18:29.879 --> 01:18:31.097
- Uh, no, I'm okay.
I have Christopher.

01:18:31.141 --> 01:18:32.359
- I mean, you live in
Westchester, right?

01:18:32.403 --> 01:18:33.752
- [Lavanya] I do.

01:18:33.796 --> 01:18:35.058
- Well, I mean, it, uh,
it'd be a few minutes

01:18:35.101 --> 01:18:36.146
before your driver gets
here, and by that time,

01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:37.321
we'd be halfway home,

01:18:37.364 --> 01:18:38.496
and I'm already
headed that direction.

01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:40.324
Plus, I got a dog-sitter
for the night, so...

01:18:40.367 --> 01:18:42.326
- Oh, you're a dog
lover. What kind of dog?

01:18:42.369 --> 01:18:44.284
- Um, Italian Bolognese.
What you know about it?

01:18:44.328 --> 01:18:45.416
- I have one of those.

01:18:45.459 --> 01:18:46.765
- Oh, okay. Well,
I just got her.

01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:48.462
You, uh, you mind givin'
me a few pointers?

01:18:48.506 --> 01:18:49.507
- Not at all.

01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:50.856
- Okay. Well, let's go.

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.902
- All right. All right.
Goodbye, everybody.

01:18:52.945 --> 01:18:54.468
- All right, goodnight, folks.
[overlapping goodbyes]

01:18:54.512 --> 01:18:55.905
- [Carlyle] Don't go too far.

01:18:55.948 --> 01:18:57.036
- Gotcha.

01:18:57.384 --> 01:18:58.255
- All right, baby.

01:18:58.298 --> 01:18:59.778
- I'm outta here. All right.

01:18:59.822 --> 01:19:01.998
And by the way, that is a
beautiful dress you have on.

01:19:02.041 --> 01:19:02.912
- Thank you.

01:19:02.955 --> 01:19:04.348
I got it from my girl's shop.

01:19:04.391 --> 01:19:07.960
- Oh. Mwah!
Goodnight! Thank you!

01:19:09.396 --> 01:19:10.441
- [Rona] MeMe?

01:19:10.484 --> 01:19:11.529
- Yes?

01:19:12.399 --> 01:19:13.270
- Wait?

01:19:13.923 --> 01:19:14.924
- Sure.

01:19:18.275 --> 01:19:19.363
- Okay.

01:19:21.887 --> 01:19:23.236
Look, um...

01:19:24.498 --> 01:19:26.892
I don't want you to think
that I'm a bad person,

01:19:26.936 --> 01:19:30.243
or [sighs] a racist,
or anything like that.

01:19:30.287 --> 01:19:31.549
It's just...

01:19:33.464 --> 01:19:36.293
Me and my father
have so many things

01:19:36.336 --> 01:19:39.252
that I just haven't
addressed yet, and...

01:19:41.037 --> 01:19:42.995
when you said all
that a month ago,

01:19:44.431 --> 01:19:46.477
it just really got to me.

01:19:48.261 --> 01:19:51.830
Look, it's not about
an Asian person,

01:19:51.874 --> 01:19:53.832
black, white, whatever.

01:19:56.269 --> 01:19:58.184
It's about me and my father.

01:19:59.185 --> 01:20:01.231
I realize that, and...

01:20:02.101 --> 01:20:04.147
for everything
that I said to you,

01:20:05.888 --> 01:20:07.454
I apologize for that.

01:20:09.108 --> 01:20:11.197
- Now knowing the Rona I know,

01:20:11.241 --> 01:20:12.808
that's pretty big.

01:20:13.983 --> 01:20:16.550
I've held grudges
myself, when I was young,

01:20:16.594 --> 01:20:18.639
because I was teased
by black people,

01:20:18.683 --> 01:20:20.511
but my mother
always told me that

01:20:20.554 --> 01:20:22.600
there are good people and bad,

01:20:23.166 --> 01:20:26.038
and that the good
always outweigh the bad.

01:20:27.387 --> 01:20:28.998
When she was in Vietnam,

01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:30.956
soldiers were
bombing her villiage.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.611
And the Americans were supposed
to clear the civilians.

01:20:34.481 --> 01:20:36.483
Well, there was one they forgot.

01:20:36.527 --> 01:20:41.010
A little scared girl in
a bamboo basket. Hidden.

01:20:42.098 --> 01:20:44.448
But there was one
soldier who went

01:20:44.491 --> 01:20:46.493
to all the different houses,

01:20:46.537 --> 01:20:48.278
making sure no one was left.

01:20:49.366 --> 01:20:51.324
And there was one
house he went to,

01:20:51.368 --> 01:20:53.109
went inside, opened
up the basket,

01:20:53.152 --> 01:20:54.893
and my mother looked up,

01:20:54.937 --> 01:20:58.027
and there stood
Private Merle Hollis,

01:20:58.375 --> 01:21:00.072
a black soldier.

01:21:01.552 --> 01:21:02.901
My mom couldn't
pronounce his name,

01:21:02.945 --> 01:21:04.860
so she kept callin' him Meho.

01:21:05.382 --> 01:21:08.037
So now, you see, Rona,
there are several reasons

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.908
why I am the person I am.

01:21:10.604 --> 01:21:13.085
Except for the fact that Meho
is an Australian boy's name,

01:21:13.129 --> 01:21:14.086
which I found out
later. [laughs]

01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:15.348
- What? [laughs]

01:21:16.219 --> 01:21:18.308
- But it was my mom's
way of sayin' thank you

01:21:18.351 --> 01:21:21.050
to Merle Hollis,
for saving her life.

01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:25.097
So, apology accepted.

01:21:26.098 --> 01:21:27.360
- Good.

01:21:27.404 --> 01:21:28.187
Sorry about that.

01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:29.362
- It's okay.

01:21:29.406 --> 01:21:30.494
- Phew!

01:21:34.454 --> 01:21:36.674
- Oh, is this some
book club love

01:21:36.717 --> 01:21:38.328
over here goin' on?

01:21:38.371 --> 01:21:39.242
- Yes.

01:21:39.285 --> 01:21:40.417
- A little bit, a little bit.

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:42.201
- Uh, nice, nice.
Thank y'all for comin'.

01:21:42.245 --> 01:21:43.376
I really appreciate it.

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:44.551
- Great time, as always.

01:21:44.595 --> 01:21:45.552
- Mwah!

01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:47.032
- Girl...

01:21:47.076 --> 01:21:48.120
- Mwah!

01:21:48.164 --> 01:21:49.252
- Plus, it's early.

01:21:49.295 --> 01:21:50.731
There's some stuff to get into.

01:21:50.775 --> 01:21:51.689
- Well, I hear that.

01:21:51.732 --> 01:21:53.343
- So, if you want to hang, Rona,

01:21:53.778 --> 01:21:55.084
you can roll with me.

01:21:56.172 --> 01:21:56.999
What do you think?

01:21:57.042 --> 01:21:58.261
- You know, MeMe, I, um,

01:21:59.131 --> 01:22:00.741
I got these kids....
- [Meho] Oh, come on.

01:22:00.785 --> 01:22:02.439
- And I need to
call the babysitter.

01:22:02.482 --> 01:22:03.570
- [Meho] One night.

01:22:03.614 --> 01:22:04.658
- And I'm gonna tell
her to buckle up

01:22:04.702 --> 01:22:06.008
'cause I'm hanging with you!

01:22:06.051 --> 01:22:08.445
- There you go.
Let's do it, girl.

01:22:08.488 --> 01:22:09.750
Let's do it. Let's go.

01:22:09.794 --> 01:22:10.708
- All right.

01:22:11.187 --> 01:22:12.928
- Hey, hey. Hey, Rona.

01:22:13.276 --> 01:22:14.407
You do saki?

01:22:14.451 --> 01:22:16.061
- Ooh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, no, no, no.

01:22:16.105 --> 01:22:17.976
I won't be doin' that little
Asian fready stuff, okay?

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.674
I watch the internet, and I
see what y'all be doin', girl.

01:22:21.458 --> 01:22:22.198
- No.

01:22:22.241 --> 01:22:24.722
- No. Rona, saki.

01:22:24.765 --> 01:22:26.985
- It's a hot alcoholic beverage.

01:22:27.029 --> 01:22:28.291
- Girl, you 're so crazy.

01:22:28.334 --> 01:22:29.466
- What, wait a minute...

01:22:29.509 --> 01:22:31.207
wait, who's gonna be
saki-ing it to me?

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:34.253
- It's a hot, alcoholic,
Asian beverage.

01:22:34.297 --> 01:22:35.472
It's a Japanese drink.

01:22:35.515 --> 01:22:38.127
- Oh, okay. Well, in
that case, I'm down.

01:22:38.170 --> 01:22:39.998
I didn't know what you
all was talking about.

01:22:40.042 --> 01:22:45.047
Okay, but um, I've never ever
had my alcohol hot, okay?

01:22:45.438 --> 01:22:46.265
On purpose.

01:22:46.309 --> 01:22:48.006
- Oh, god. Get out, girl.

01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:49.486
If you don't get
outta here...[laughs]

01:22:49.529 --> 01:22:52.010
- Love ya. See you. Bye.

01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:06.633
- Oh, okay. What's, what's, uh,

01:23:06.677 --> 01:23:08.505
what 's that for, Mrs. Charles?

01:23:08.548 --> 01:23:10.376
- Well, in my session this week,

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.161
my therapist told me
to hug five people

01:23:12.204 --> 01:23:13.640
that have affected my life.

01:23:13.684 --> 01:23:17.079
Thus far, I hugged my
husband, I hugged my daughter,

01:23:17.122 --> 01:23:18.602
I hugged my therapist,

01:23:18.645 --> 01:23:20.082
I hugged my doctor,

01:23:20.865 --> 01:23:23.259
and I hugged you. [chuckles]

01:23:23.694 --> 01:23:25.130
Don't you be no stranger.

01:23:25.174 --> 01:23:27.306
- Oh, I could never be a
stranger to my play mom.

01:23:32.137 --> 01:23:33.051
All right.

01:23:33.095 --> 01:23:34.531
- Thank you, son. Take care.

01:23:34.574 --> 01:23:35.227
- All right. We gotta get
back on that golf course.

01:23:35.271 --> 01:23:36.359
- Oh, we will. We will.

01:23:36.402 --> 01:23:37.664
We definitely will.
Take care now.

01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:39.623
- Good seeing you.
Thanks for comin'.

01:23:39.666 --> 01:23:40.493
- Take care of yourself now.

01:23:40.537 --> 01:23:41.364
- Bye. Thank you, Daddy.

01:23:42.408 --> 01:23:43.496
Oh, you got it?

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.671
- Yeah, I got it. Don't worry.

01:23:44.715 --> 01:23:47.587
Mwah! Kisses. Mwah. No, darling!

01:23:47.631 --> 01:23:49.633
Have a great evening!
- [Bunny] Be safe.

01:23:49.676 --> 01:23:50.808
Bye.

01:23:56.118 --> 01:23:57.684
- So, what I sayin'
is that, you know,

01:23:57.728 --> 01:23:59.338
if the rest of these
clowns can do a book,

01:23:59.382 --> 01:24:00.339
I know I can do a book.

01:24:00.383 --> 01:24:01.514
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:24:01.558 --> 01:24:02.733
So, wait 'til you
read my, I mean,

01:24:02.776 --> 01:24:04.343
I'm not sayin' that
because I'm a clown,

01:24:04.387 --> 01:24:05.475
that I could right a book.

01:24:05.518 --> 01:24:06.563
I'm just sayin'
that, like, people,

01:24:06.606 --> 01:24:08.043
I got stuff to tell people...

01:24:08.695 --> 01:24:11.133
Yo! Yo, where'd everybody go?

01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:12.351
Where's Monte?

01:24:12.395 --> 01:24:14.092
- Oh, he left a while
ago with Lavanya.

01:24:14.136 --> 01:24:15.615
- Yo, he's my ride, man.

01:24:15.659 --> 01:24:16.747
See what I'm talkin' about?

01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:19.097
Chapter one, "Flaky
Friends". See?

01:24:19.141 --> 01:24:20.620
That's in my book.
I'll see ya all later.

01:24:20.664 --> 01:24:24.146
Monte! Mr. Charles! One of
you give me a ride home!

01:24:24.494 --> 01:24:25.234
- Bunny, you good?

01:24:25.277 --> 01:24:26.365
- Yeah.

01:24:26.409 --> 01:24:27.279
- You mind if I
chill out for a bit?

01:24:27.323 --> 01:24:29.064
- Oh, sure. Yeah. That's cool.

01:24:29.368 --> 01:24:31.370
- Carlyle. Put a movie in?

01:24:31.414 --> 01:24:33.242
- Yeah. Yeah. The new
ones are on the top shelf.

01:24:33.285 --> 01:24:34.547
- Okay. Bye, Bunny.

01:24:34.591 --> 01:24:35.722
- Bye.

01:24:41.337 --> 01:24:42.729
How's the knee?

01:24:42.773 --> 01:24:45.863
- Oh, yeah. It's, it's
good. It's much better now.

01:24:47.473 --> 01:24:50.868
- When's the, um, next time
you get to see little Carlyle?

01:24:50.911 --> 01:24:53.479
- Uh, this week. Yeah, um...

01:24:54.437 --> 01:24:55.829
Me and Helema, we've uh,

01:24:55.873 --> 01:24:58.702
we're arranging
visitation ourselves.

01:24:58.745 --> 01:24:59.616
So, I'm gonna bring him by here

01:24:59.659 --> 01:25:01.705
so he can see his Aunt Bunny.

01:25:01.748 --> 01:25:03.750
- Oh, he's so adorable.

01:25:03.794 --> 01:25:05.056
- [Carlyle] Yeah.

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:07.363
- And he's very blessed
to have you as a father.

01:25:07.885 --> 01:25:09.669
- Thanks.
- [Bunny] Yeah.

01:25:11.802 --> 01:25:16.328
- Bunny, we haven't, um, we
haven't spoken since that night.

01:25:17.199 --> 01:25:20.289
I know it's because, uh, maybe
you're busy with the shop,

01:25:20.332 --> 01:25:21.725
and you know, I-I'm packin'.

01:25:21.768 --> 01:25:24.206
We're both so, so busy...

01:25:24.467 --> 01:25:25.642
- Avoiding it.

01:25:26.469 --> 01:25:27.600
- [Carlyle] Is that it?

01:25:27.644 --> 01:25:31.213
- Yeah, we're both
so busy avoiding it.

01:25:31.865 --> 01:25:34.346
That's one thing
about you and me.

01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:36.827
We can talk about
anything under the sun,

01:25:37.523 --> 01:25:39.438
except for you and me.

01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:42.485
I mean, don't get
me wrong, though.

01:25:42.528 --> 01:25:45.488
I mean, I'm, I'm glad
nothin' happened.

01:25:47.359 --> 01:25:50.232
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, me too.

01:25:51.233 --> 01:25:52.495
- [Bunny] Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:25:55.976 --> 01:25:57.674
You know, it's not like...

01:25:58.762 --> 01:26:01.243
Okay, we found ourselves in
what could be called a...

01:26:02.505 --> 01:26:05.812
I don't know, sensual,
or sexual, you know...

01:26:05.856 --> 01:26:07.336
- It was intimate.

01:26:07.379 --> 01:26:08.946
- Intimate setting.

01:26:08.989 --> 01:26:10.774
But that doesn't mean that you
gotta take advantage of it.

01:26:10.817 --> 01:26:12.341
- [Bunny] Right.

01:26:12.384 --> 01:26:13.907
- I felt like I was breaking
the trust that I have with you.

01:26:13.951 --> 01:26:17.389
Even though we've never talked
about what that trust is,

01:26:18.782 --> 01:26:20.175
I think it's till there.

01:26:21.263 --> 01:26:24.004
- I mean, it's like not quite

01:26:24.048 --> 01:26:25.789
a brother and sister
feeling, but...

01:26:25.832 --> 01:26:26.833
- [Carlyle] Yeah.

01:26:26.877 --> 01:26:28.966
- It's like somebody
significant.

01:26:29.619 --> 01:26:31.621
A special man that I do love,

01:26:31.664 --> 01:26:34.885
but I'm not necessarily
in love with.

01:26:35.712 --> 01:26:36.843
I don't know. I mean, I don't...

01:26:36.887 --> 01:26:39.237
I-I can't explain it.

01:26:40.064 --> 01:26:41.457
I really, I can't.

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.676
- I don't know if we
should be tryin' to

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.678
figure it out, if we
should be, you know,

01:26:45.722 --> 01:26:47.245
tryin' to label it for
someone to understand,

01:26:47.289 --> 01:26:48.420
put in a book.

01:26:48.899 --> 01:26:50.379
- I mean, I just, you know...

01:26:50.422 --> 01:26:54.034
I think there's
some things in life,

01:26:54.078 --> 01:26:55.819
special things, that you just

01:26:56.733 --> 01:26:59.344
shouldn't fight for
an explanation for.

01:26:59.736 --> 01:27:00.998
The heavens,

01:27:01.738 --> 01:27:03.435
human existance,

01:27:05.568 --> 01:27:06.699
us.

01:27:08.919 --> 01:27:11.443
I'm gonna miss you, roommate.

01:27:14.751 --> 01:27:16.970
- Helema Bunny Charles,

01:27:17.014 --> 01:27:19.364
my dearest friend,

01:27:21.801 --> 01:27:23.020
I love you.

01:27:24.891 --> 01:27:26.893
Carlyle Suggs,

01:27:27.851 --> 01:27:29.505
I love you, too.

01:27:45.347 --> 01:27:46.913
- Hey, if we're not,

01:27:46.957 --> 01:27:49.394
if we're not married
in five years,

01:27:49.438 --> 01:27:50.787
you wanna just...

01:27:52.745 --> 01:27:53.790
Nah.

01:27:54.138 --> 01:27:56.009
[audience laughing]

01:28:00.797 --> 01:28:03.278
[receding footsteps]

01:28:06.933 --> 01:28:08.587
[exhales slowly]

01:28:09.458 --> 01:28:11.938
[audience cheering and clapping]

01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:17.814
[upbeat music]
