That was on lsla Sorna,

09:00.540 --> 09:04.084
We bred the animals there,
and nurtured them
for a few months,

09:04.169 --> 09:06.503
then moved them

Call it an act of God.

09:18.642 --> 09:21.644

were released

or constraining technology.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.996

09:41.748 --> 09:45.209
l've tried to keep it safe
from human interference.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.587
That's right. Hopefully,
you've kept the island

09:48.672 --> 09:51.131
quarantined and contained.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.259
But l'm in shock
about all this.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.344
l mean, that they're
still alive.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.680
You bred them
lysine-deficient.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.932
Shouldn't they have
kicked after seven days

10:00.016 --> 10:01.642
without supplemental enzymes?

10:01.726 --> 10:04.228
Yes! But, by God,
they're flourishing.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.523
That's one of

10:08.817 --> 10:09.858
Yes.

10:10.527 --> 10:14.697

an expedition to go in,

10:15.240 --> 10:17.616

and document them.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.582

You mean with people?

10:25.709 --> 10:29.211
Yes, the animals
won't know they're there.
Very low impact.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.089
Strictly observation
and documentation.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.258
HAMMOND:
Our satellite infrareds

10:34.342 --> 10:37.303
show the animals
are fiercely territorial.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.806
The carnivores
are isolated in the
interior of the island

10:40.890 --> 10:43.434
so the team can stay
on the outer rim.

10:43.810 --> 10:47.438
Don't worry. l'm not making
the same mistakes again.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.149
No, you're making
all new ones.

10:51.401 --> 10:55.446
John ! So, there's
another island
with dinosaurs,

10:55.572 --> 10:59.158
no fences this time,
and you want to send
people in,

10:59.326 --> 11:02.745
very few people,
on the ground, right?

11:03.288 --> 11:06.248
Who are the four lunatics
you're trying
to con into this?

11:06.333 --> 11:09.376
lt was difficult
to convince them as to
what they would see,

11:09.461 --> 11:12.004
in the end had
to use my checkbook
to get them there.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.673
But there's Nick Van Owen,

11:14.758 --> 11:16.592
who is
a video documentarian,

11:18.345 --> 11:21.930
Eddie Carr,
who's a field
equipment expert.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.601
We have
our paleontologist

11:26.019 --> 11:29.813
and l was hoping
that perhaps you might
be the fourth.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.650
We've been on the verge
of Chapter 1 1

11:33.735 --> 11:35.611
ever since that
accident in the park.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.112
There are those
in the company

11:37.197 --> 11:39.490
who wanted to
exploit Site B

11:39.574 --> 11:41.450
in order to bail us out.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.577
They've been
planning it for years,

11:43.661 --> 11:46.038
and l've been able
to stop them until now.

11:46.247 --> 11:50.376
But, a few weeks ago,
a British family
on a yacht cruise

11:50.960 --> 11:55.923
stumbled across the island
and their wee girl
was injured.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.258
She's fine.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.596
But the board
has used the incident

12:02.680 --> 12:04.348
to take control
of lnGen from me.

12:05.183 --> 12:08.310
Now it's only a matter
of time before this

12:08.853 --> 12:11.647
lost world
is found and pillaged.

12:13.441 --> 12:16.402
Public opinion is
the one thing l can use
to preserve it,

12:16.486 --> 12:18.404
but to rally that support

12:18.822 --> 12:21.407
l need a complete
photo record

12:21.491 --> 12:24.535
of those animals alive
and in their
natural habitat.

12:25.036 --> 12:28.372
So you went from
capitalist to naturalist
in just four years.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.666
That's something.

12:33.378 --> 12:37.214
lt's our last chance
at redemption.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.177
John,

12:43.221 --> 12:44.430
no.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.224
Of course, no.

12:47.350 --> 12:51.145
And l'm going to contact
the other three members
of your team

12:51.229 --> 12:53.272
and stop them from going.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.691
Who's the paleontologist,
by the way?

12:56.025 --> 12:58.360
She came to me,
l want you to know this.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.529
Who did?

13:01.030 --> 13:03.991
Leave it to you, lan,
to have associations,
affiliations,

13:04.075 --> 13:07.327
even liaisons,
with the best people
in so many fields.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.662
Not Sarah.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.707
Paleontological behavior
study is a new field,

13:11.791 --> 13:13.459
and Sarah Harding
is on that frontier.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.586
Her theories on
parenting and nurturing

13:15.670 --> 13:17.963
amongst carnivores
have framed the debate.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.465
What are you doing?

13:19.549 --> 13:20.883
Where's your phone?

13:24.304 --> 13:25.888
HAMMOND: lt's too late.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.474
She's already there.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.058
(PHONE BEEPS OFF)

13:33.563 --> 13:36.064
The others are
meeting her in three days.

13:41.279 --> 13:44.406
You sent my girlfriend
to this island alone?

13:45.074 --> 13:48.202
"Sent" is hardly the word.
She couldn't be restrained.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.204
She was already
working in San Diego,

13:50.288 --> 13:52.331
doing some research
at the animal park.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.917
lt's only a couple
of hours' flight from there.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.670
She was adamant,
absolutely adamant about,
here you are,

13:58.796 --> 14:01.757
about making the initial
foray by herself.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.092
She thinks
she's Dian Fossey.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.261
"Observation
without interference,"
she said.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.680
She went on and on.
You know how it is.

14:08.765 --> 14:12.351
After you were
injured in the park,
she sought you out.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.896
Then she went all
the way to a hospital
in Costa Rica

14:15.980 --> 14:19.691
to ask somebody
who she didn't even know
if the rumors were true.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.611
lf you want
to leave your name
on something, fine.

14:22.737 --> 14:26.114
But stop
putting it on other
people's headstones.

14:26.449 --> 14:31.078
She'll be fine.
She's spent years studying
African predators.

14:31.162 --> 14:34.790
Sleeping downwind and all.
She knows what she's doing.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.626
And, believe me,
the research team will. . .
