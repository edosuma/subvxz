42:42.852 --> 42:44.562

42:44.645 --> 42:46.981

you've been a danger to Franny.

43:13.049 --> 43:15.093
Is that true?

he should come to Afghanistan.

was gonna take me up on it.

44:12.358 --> 44:14.110

I showed up at Bagram

44:14.193 --> 44:15.695

was on the fucking tarmac.

No.

44:34.630 --> 44:37.049
But the FBI
most certainly will.

44:38.384 --> 44:41.888

the focus of an investigation

the rest of your life.

keeping me here,
