00:12.912 --> 00:14.243
We got company.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.656
Attention, unidentified aircraft.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.527
This is Colonel Steve Conway
of the United States Air Force.

00:30.563 --> 00:31.860
- Hi!
- Hi!

00:31.898 --> 00:33.525
You're currently flying
in restricted air space.

00:33.566 --> 00:34.931
- Oh, damn it.
- What?

00:34.968 --> 00:37.163
You will follow us
to the nearest landing area.

00:37.203 --> 00:41.936
If you fail to comply,
we will not hesitate to shoot you down.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.602
What are you doing?
We don't have time for this.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.149
Let me handle this.

00:52.185 --> 00:57.122
Sir, your craft is unregistered,
and you failed to file a flight plan.

00:57.157 --> 00:58.715
Just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

00:58.758 --> 01:00.589
Don't you people have
anything better to do...

01:00.627 --> 01:03.118
than harass innocent people
trying to get to Marrakesh?

01:03.163 --> 01:04.721
Zip it, Grandpa.
I'm speaking to the pilot.

01:04.763 --> 01:06.629
Grandpa?
Well, I'll have you know...

01:06.666 --> 01:08.634
Sir, I am not gonna tell you again.

01:08.668 --> 01:11.296
It's all right, soldier.
I got special clearance.

01:11.337 --> 01:13.669
I'm with a top-secret
branch of the government.

01:13.706 --> 01:16.800
So if you don't mind, we have
a mission to get back to.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.174
Sir.

01:18.211 --> 01:20.179
This I.D. Expired six months ago.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.009
Great.

01:23.049 --> 01:24.914
When Marrakesh is overrun
by mutant lizard people...

01:24.951 --> 01:26.282
don't come crying to me.

02:17.871 --> 02:21.238
Grandpa! How dare they!

02:21.274 --> 02:23.265
I'm only 43.
Still a young man.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.004
Maybe a little frayed around the edges...

02:25.044 --> 02:28.013
but who wouldn't be between my work
and raising two boys?

02:28.047 --> 02:29.742
Crap. Who am I kidding?

02:29.782 --> 02:31.010
My looks are going down the toilet...

02:31.050 --> 02:33.416
faster than an unwanted
pregnancy on prom night.

02:33.453 --> 02:37.082
I was Rusty Venture, boy-friggin'-wonder.

02:37.123 --> 02:38.488
Now look at me.

02:42.562 --> 02:44.792
I can't go on denying the world
my extra-greatness.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.959
I should be out there mixing it up,
having fun.

02:48.001 --> 02:52.870
That's it! I just need a little "me" time
to put the spring back in my step.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.737
Oh, and a super-hot car!

03:00.747 --> 03:02.146
Don't worry, Brock.

03:02.181 --> 03:04.445
You'll be able to
kill guys again in no time!

03:04.484 --> 03:06.714
And fly jets and do secret agent stuff.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.482
Hank and I are on the case.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.547
With our help, you're sure to ace
the agent's exam, no prob.

03:16.262 --> 03:19.026
Whoa! Look at those wheels!

03:19.065 --> 03:21.295
Hey, Gloomy Gus. Hop in.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.427
I've got a top-secret mission
for you, buddy.

03:23.469 --> 03:25.198
I can't.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.830
I'm not a secret agent anymore.

03:28.308 --> 03:31.402
You don't need a license
for Operation "Get Me Some."

03:31.444 --> 03:33.071
What's got into you?

03:33.112 --> 03:35.842
Come on, Brock.
Two young studs like us...

03:35.882 --> 03:38.715
we're show ponies.
We need to strut our stuff.

03:38.751 --> 03:41.117
What say we make the scene?

03:41.154 --> 03:43.179
I gotta see this.

03:43.222 --> 03:45.315
Move over. I'm driving.

03:45.358 --> 03:46.791
Where are you guys going?

03:46.826 --> 03:49.886
And why are you dressed like
the clown on my lamp, Pop?

03:49.929 --> 03:52.124
Boys' night out.
Don't wait up for us.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.463
Dean, you're in charge.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.762
Ciao.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.373
You hear that? I'm in charge...

04:01.407 --> 04:04.934
and I think it's just about
wittle Hanky's bedtime.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.502
Oh, take a bow.

04:06.546 --> 04:08.138
Poughkeepsie!

04:13.453 --> 04:15.683
Oh, hold on a sec.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.017
How do I look? Be brutal.

04:19.058 --> 04:21.685
You look like a big...

04:21.728 --> 04:23.025
doll.

04:23.062 --> 04:25.758
Rusty is back.

04:31.170 --> 04:33.900
Oh, pretty dead in here, huh?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.465
Not a whole lot of talent.

04:36.509 --> 04:39.171
Doesn't usually get jumpin' till 11:00.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.180
And, you know, on a Friday.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.511
Can I help you gentlemen?

04:42.548 --> 04:44.641
- Bud.
- You got it, ape-drape.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.209
A Bud for Captain Mullet-head.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.818
How 'bout you, Professor?

04:57.230 --> 04:59.755
I'll have a Rob Roy.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.323
What?

05:03.102 --> 05:05.127
So, teach me, Brock.
I'm a quick study.

05:05.171 --> 05:07.469
How do you pick up the women?

05:07.507 --> 05:09.839
Just gotta throw the vibe out there.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.477
Well, the welcome mat's out.
Let's see who comes a-knocking.

05:16.516 --> 05:20.008
Oh, Brock, check out the main stage,
but don't make it obvious.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.782
Rusty like.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.652
She's looking at me.
What do I do?

05:23.690 --> 05:25.749
Give her, like, five bucks.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.323
Can you break this?

05:36.202 --> 05:38.568
That's a nice medallion
you got there, baby.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.469
Oh, this?

05:40.506 --> 05:42.269
Science prize, '79.

05:42.308 --> 05:43.798
The best paper I ever wrote.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.209
Turned the whole gravity thing
upside down.

05:46.245 --> 05:48.611
And that pun was intentional, honey.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.081
She's totally into me.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.606
This is too easy.
Where's the capture and kill?

05:52.685 --> 05:53.845
Bye!

05:53.886 --> 05:55.319
Shall I follow her?

05:55.354 --> 05:56.787
Be right back.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.852
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:04.997 --> 06:06.589
OK. Let me get this straight.

06:06.632 --> 06:11.001
$15, Grandpa's catcher's mitt,
and you'll be my slave for the night.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.435
- Give it.
- The whole thing.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.042
Dude, I spit in that.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.739
I can't do this!

07:01.420 --> 07:02.887
Oh, you're back.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.287
You didn't miss much.

07:04.323 --> 07:05.950
Oh, one of them was dressed
like a cheerleader...

07:05.992 --> 07:08.153
and said she was nineteen,
but she had a Cesarean scar...

07:08.194 --> 07:10.958
and her face had more lines on it
than a mirror at Studio 54.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.056
- I gotta go.
- Wait a minute!

07:13.099 --> 07:16.296
You're not allowed to ditch me!
You're my bodyguard!

07:16.335 --> 07:18.030
How can I be?

07:18.070 --> 07:19.935
Leaving us so soon, hockey hair?

07:25.344 --> 07:28.609
Compliments of the lady
at the end of the bar.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.343
He's coming over.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.911
He took the bait!
Excellent.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.582
It's all going according to plan.

07:37.623 --> 07:41.923
Proceed with phase two,
Dr. Girlfriend... ensnarement.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.324
Make it shine, Gunga Din.

07:49.368 --> 07:51.495
Yes, Effendi.

07:51.537 --> 07:54.665
So I said, "Listen, my Dad
invented Univac...

07:54.707 --> 07:56.072
"so I think I would know."

07:56.108 --> 07:59.077
Well, that uppity little T.A.
Didn't give me any more trouble...

07:59.111 --> 08:00.476
the rest of the semester.

08:03.749 --> 08:05.341
You dog, you.

08:05.384 --> 08:07.147
That's it, precious.

08:07.186 --> 08:08.744
Make him think you're interested.

08:08.788 --> 08:13.054
Now, twirl your hair. Good.

08:13.092 --> 08:15.151
OK, run your finger
around the rim of your...

08:15.194 --> 08:16.821
oh, excellent. Just like that.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.455
You're doing great, Pumpkin.

08:18.497 --> 08:19.862
So, I didn't catch your name.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.333
Oh, crap!
We never planned for this contingency.

08:22.368 --> 08:23.699
Quick! Make something up!

08:29.675 --> 08:31.336
No way, Jose!

08:31.377 --> 08:34.403
Drink it, slave!
Your master commands you.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.410
- Hey, Brock!
- Go to bed.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.054
Why would you dress like that?

08:43.089 --> 08:45.216
Dean lost a bet, and now he's my slave...

08:45.258 --> 08:47.954
and he's refusing
a direct order to drink this.

08:47.994 --> 08:50.292
You never welch on a bet, Dean.

08:50.329 --> 08:52.820
Be a man. Drink it.

08:52.865 --> 08:56.323
You go to bed.
Your father's gonna be...

09:03.209 --> 09:05.040
Brock looks like hell.

09:05.077 --> 09:06.635
Drink it.

09:06.679 --> 09:10.012
So, uh... this is me.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.476
OK, Charlene.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.919
How 'bout I give you my number...

09:15.955 --> 09:18.423
to my private two-way
wrist communicator watch?

09:18.457 --> 09:22.223
How about I give you
a ride to your place?

09:31.337 --> 09:33.635
Yes, yes. More tongue.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.140
Stroke his ear.

09:35.174 --> 09:36.368
Like that, yes.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.934
Yes.

09:38.978 --> 09:40.445
Oh, you're good.

09:40.479 --> 09:42.106
You are good.

09:42.148 --> 09:45.174
That's my good girl.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.497
What are you doing?!

09:59.532 --> 10:01.762
I was getting juice.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.234
I'm thirsty.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.164
Do you have any condoms?

10:06.205 --> 10:08.503
- What?
- Just a mo.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.532
Wait a minute.
You're not supposed to sleep with him!

10:19.418 --> 10:20.976
Condoms.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.614
Rusty doesn't need gadgets
to please a woman.

10:26.258 --> 10:27.953
So you like it rou...

10:30.563 --> 10:33.691
No worries, Brock.
I'll walk you through the written portion.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.826
Question one.

10:35.868 --> 10:39.201
You're in Prague.
A sniper's in the window above you.

10:39.238 --> 10:42.833
There's an alligator behind you
and a grizzly bear in front of you.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.604
What do you do? Do you...

10:44.643 --> 10:47.203
Back somersault.
Pry off the alligator's jaw.

10:47.246 --> 10:49.009
Use it as a boomerang
to take out the sniper.

10:49.048 --> 10:50.538
When he falls out the window...

10:50.583 --> 10:52.517
the grizzly will go straight
for the easier meal.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.384
The answer's "C."

10:57.423 --> 10:59.755
Morning, all.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.225
Hey, Pop.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.990
Wow, I'm bushed.
Didn't get a lick of sleep.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.657
What happened to your neck?

11:05.698 --> 11:06.995
Oh, this?

11:07.033 --> 11:08.660
Love bite.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.828
You'll understand when you're older.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.667
Brock, I'm all out of condom.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.536
Could you pick me up one
if you go out?

11:16.275 --> 11:17.936
OK, next question.

11:17.977 --> 11:21.504
You hear muffled whimpers
coming from the trunk of a limousine.

11:21.547 --> 11:23.674
Well, I'll see you fellas a little later.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.843
- However...
- Going back upstairs.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.580
The limousine has diplomatic plates.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.451
With my two coffees.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.856
Monarch's outside.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.796
Rise and shine, lovin' spoonful.

11:38.831 --> 11:42.392
Care for a little pick-me-up
before round two?

11:44.136 --> 11:45.763
Fun stuff?

11:54.847 --> 11:56.906
Tell him you're going out
with the girls tonight or something.

11:56.949 --> 11:59.509
- I don't care.
- He's not buying it.

11:59.552 --> 12:03.488
Oh, I know!
Tell him you think it's moving too fast.

12:03.522 --> 12:05.149
Let's cut right to the grate.

12:05.191 --> 12:10.652
How 'bout you swing by, I don't know,
I'm thinking like six-thirty-ish...

12:10.696 --> 12:12.721
and pick ol' Doc up?

12:12.765 --> 12:14.164
Oh, don't be foolish.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.964
You don't need to wash your hair
before our date.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.430
OK, fine. I'll pick you up at six...

12:20.473 --> 12:21.997
- What?
- Thirty.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.338
I forbid it!

12:23.375 --> 12:26.173
He wouldn't take no for an answer.
I have to go.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.180
Not unless you're going to plant
a bomb in his car.

12:28.214 --> 12:30.114
It'll look suspicious if I don't.

12:30.149 --> 12:31.514
Poison his drink?

12:31.550 --> 12:33.177
I have to get ready.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.380
You're falling in love with him.

12:36.722 --> 12:40.214
You slept with him, didn't you?

12:41.794 --> 12:46.060
Well, I scored your sample test, Brock,
and, well, you did better than Hank did...

12:46.098 --> 12:50.034
but let's just say you're gonna have to do
awfully well on the physical portion.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.629
No problem.
Your training begins now.

12:52.671 --> 12:54.798
Drink up!

12:54.840 --> 12:56.535
Your ass is mine, Samson.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.133
When I get through with you...

12:58.177 --> 13:00.771
you're gonna eat lightning
and crap thunder!

13:00.813 --> 13:04.180
Looks more like he's gonna
drink eggs and crap... eggs.

13:04.216 --> 13:06.343
Well, I'm off on my date.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.683
Brock, watch the boys
while I'm gone, will you?

13:08.721 --> 13:10.245
You're still allowed to do that much, right?

13:10.289 --> 13:12.416
I'm a little worried about that hickey, Doc.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.983
Oh, Brock, don't worry.

13:15.027 --> 13:16.654
I'm not falling in love.

13:16.695 --> 13:17.992
That's not what l...

13:18.030 --> 13:19.327
And what would be wrong
with that if I was?

13:19.365 --> 13:21.026
The boys need a new mommy.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.556
Rusty needs a new mommy.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.728
We don't even know
who our old mommy was.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.829
That's right.

13:26.872 --> 13:28.567
I've never really told you about her.

13:29.808 --> 13:31.173
Well, she was...

13:31.210 --> 13:33.075
That'll be Charlene.
Gotta run, boys.

13:33.112 --> 13:34.704
Don't stay up too late!

13:36.782 --> 13:37.976
Did you spit in this?

13:38.017 --> 13:40.679
Don't eyeball me, Samson.
Drink it!

14:11.350 --> 14:13.215
Come on, Brock!

14:13.252 --> 14:15.914
You need strong cardiovascular
and agility training.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.217
No.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.931
You're nothing! You're weak!

14:30.970 --> 14:33.336
Why do you even want to be
a secret agent, boy?

14:33.372 --> 14:34.669
You think you're good enough?

14:34.707 --> 14:38.336
Hank, seriously, when I get
my license back, I'm allowed to kill you.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.538
Sorry, Brock.

14:43.082 --> 14:45.949
I packed a lunch for you,
bologna and cheese...

14:45.985 --> 14:47.850
and I cut the crusts off the way I like.

14:47.886 --> 14:51.151
And I downloaded a bunch of crib notes
into your communicator watch.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.817
You get stuck on one
of the hard questions...

14:52.858 --> 14:54.086
just look it up.

15:06.038 --> 15:07.369
What's wrong?

15:07.406 --> 15:08.634
What's the matter?

15:08.674 --> 15:10.266
I have something to show you all.

15:10.309 --> 15:13.005
Those of you with weak stomachs
should leave now.

15:14.280 --> 15:19.081
What you're about to see is a nightmare
inexplicably torn from the pages of Kafka.

15:19.118 --> 15:21.484
Holy crap! What happened?

15:21.520 --> 15:26.150
Apparently, this is the reward I get
for years of screwing with super science.

15:26.191 --> 15:29.854
In short, I pissed in God's eye,
and he blinked.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.055
Golly. Does it hurt?

15:31.096 --> 15:33.656
No, but the poking does.
Let's stop that now.

15:33.699 --> 15:36.668
Sorry. Hey, what's H.E.L.P.eR. Gotten into?

15:36.702 --> 15:39.535
That appears to be my dermis.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.698
Wow. I bet if you put that
under your pillow...

15:41.740 --> 15:43.571
the tooth fairy will give you, like, a grand!

15:43.609 --> 15:46.476
OK, Hank, you are taking this way too well.

15:46.512 --> 15:47.706
Well, gee, Dad...

15:47.746 --> 15:50.078
we've seen a lot of
strange stuff over the years.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.310
Last week we were fighting
a giant dinosaur.

15:52.351 --> 15:54.649
Granted, but I wasn't the dinosaur.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.348
Can't you see where
this is maybe different?

15:56.388 --> 15:58.015
Where's Brock? Where's Dean?

15:58.057 --> 16:01.254
I can't believe I'm hearing this!

16:01.293 --> 16:04.456
He's turned you against me
with his oily sex...

16:04.496 --> 16:06.987
That cunning Casanova.

16:07.032 --> 16:08.329
I'm not against you.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.494
I just feel bad about what I did.

16:10.536 --> 16:13.835
You should!
Screwing him was never part of the plan!

16:13.872 --> 16:18.002
Not that. I mean injecting him
with that horrible serum.

16:18.043 --> 16:21.137
No, see, that part
you should feel good about.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.011
That was the plan!

16:23.048 --> 16:26.415
He's not such a bad guy
if you take the time to get to know him.

16:26.452 --> 16:29.114
You two actually have a lot in common.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.418
Yeah, we do now.

16:31.457 --> 16:33.823
I didn't sleep with him.

16:35.060 --> 16:36.220
Prove it.

16:37.363 --> 16:39.923
What the hell am I going to do?
H.E.L.P.eR!

16:40.999 --> 16:44.457
I need you to be my hands
if I'm to find an antidote to this dilemma.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.404
OK, we'll start
with the chlorophosphate.

16:47.439 --> 16:49.202
Maybe a little diasporous peptides.

16:49.241 --> 16:51.038
A little... ugh!

16:51.076 --> 16:53.101
The green one, the red one,
and the blue one!

16:56.915 --> 17:00.510
Yeah, I'm here to take my...
secret agent test.

17:00.552 --> 17:03.715
Ah, Mr. Samson. Excellent. OK.

17:03.756 --> 17:04.983
Please empty your pockets...

17:05.022 --> 17:06.786
of any pieces of paper
you might have on your person...

17:06.825 --> 17:08.416
and I'll escort you to the testing area.

17:09.661 --> 17:12.653
Oh, and please remove
your two-way communicator watch.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.892
Damn it.

17:13.932 --> 17:15.194
No.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.602
Bad robot.
Bad H.E.L.P.eR!

17:18.637 --> 17:21.628
We don't do that!
We do not eat test tubes.

17:21.673 --> 17:23.367
Come here.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.809
I'm not playing games here.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.103
What? You don't feel well now?

17:29.148 --> 17:30.706
Well, what did you expect?

17:30.749 --> 17:32.444
You're mixing acids and bases there.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.210
No! H.E.L.P.eR!

17:36.255 --> 17:37.449
No!

17:42.694 --> 17:47.256
This test will test your acumen
with firearms.

17:47.299 --> 17:50.462
- You'll have two min...
- No guns. I don't use guns.

17:50.502 --> 17:53.699
The nine millimeter Glock
is standard issue to all agents in the field.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.105
- You're required to...
- Guns are for...

18:22.000 --> 18:23.627
Oh, just do it, H.E.L.P.eR!

18:23.669 --> 18:25.193
Use the special hand attachments
I gave you...

18:25.237 --> 18:27.432
and just pull the trigger!

18:30.542 --> 18:33.909
Oh, you ungrateful metal pansy!

18:33.946 --> 18:35.311
Some help you...

19:00.839 --> 19:03.706
Well, let's see here, Mr. Samson.

19:03.742 --> 19:06.939
On the driving portion, you totaled
every car but the one you were driving.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.675
On the pistol range,
you refused to use a gun.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.650
And oh, ha! Yeah, here's my favorite.

19:12.684 --> 19:15.278
On the written, you drew
a little guy with wings...

19:15.320 --> 19:17.015
from the Led Zeppelin records.

19:17.055 --> 19:18.454
Icarus.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.459
So, uh, what are you
trying to tell me here, little man?

19:21.493 --> 19:23.017
That you don't like Zepp?

19:26.965 --> 19:29.957
My father is General Traceter.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.435
You saved his life.

19:31.470 --> 19:34.303
The man spoke of you as a god...

19:34.339 --> 19:36.170
and you did not disappoint.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.607
Oh, yeah.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.907
I used to baby-sit you.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.548
Hey, Pop.

19:46.585 --> 19:47.847
What are you doing?

19:47.886 --> 19:49.751
I don't know.
I can't stop myself.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.585
I'm compelled.

19:51.623 --> 19:52.988
Looks hard.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.391
Not really. The little back legs
do most of the work.

19:55.427 --> 19:56.758
Can I try?

19:56.795 --> 19:58.160
Listen to me, Hank.

19:58.196 --> 20:00.926
I don't know what's gonna happen to me
when I finish with this.

20:00.966 --> 20:04.060
I could turn into something new
and hideous, monstrous.

20:04.102 --> 20:07.503
Upon exiting this horrible thing,
I might try to kill one or all of you.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.801
Golly!

20:08.840 --> 20:10.671
Do you know how to fire a shotgun, Hank?

20:10.709 --> 20:11.869
Answer me!

20:11.910 --> 20:16.779
Daddy, there's a lady
with a super-deep voice here to see you.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.009
Charlene?

20:18.050 --> 20:19.677
No! She can't see me this way.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.915
Tell her l... Hi, sweetie.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.082
So now you know why I haven't called.

20:25.123 --> 20:27.284
That's our cue, wuss.

20:29.094 --> 20:31.426
Are you really gonna kill Dad?

20:31.463 --> 20:33.727
You're a worm, Rusty.

20:33.765 --> 20:36.598
I would have called, but...
Oh, right. This.

20:36.635 --> 20:37.932
I'm in the super science racket.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.494
These things happen.

20:39.538 --> 20:42.473
So, I guess this is good-bye.

20:42.507 --> 20:45.101
I will remember these
last few days with you...

20:45.143 --> 20:46.940
as the happiest of my life...

20:46.979 --> 20:49.072
well, except for the caterpillar part, I mean.

20:49.114 --> 20:53.346
Could I have one last kiss
before I leave?

20:53.385 --> 20:56.582
Well, all right, but don't touch those
thick hairs on my back.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.146
I think they're my new ears.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.687
Wow, you're a dirty girl!

21:01.727 --> 21:04.252
This is turning you on, isn't it,
you little slu...

21:10.202 --> 21:12.136
Hey, if it isn't Franken-mullet.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.331
What can I do you for?

21:56.982 --> 21:58.745
What the hell happened?

21:58.784 --> 22:00.547
Go, Team Venture!

22:03.689 --> 22:06.180
That's good soup!
