39:30.620 --> 39:33.456
(MUSIC PLAYING)

39:39.921 --> 39:42.507
This is great. Boy meets girl,
girl gets dug up

39:42.590 --> 39:44.092
and reburied
with boy's corpse.

39:44.175 --> 39:46.386
-I love a happy ending.
-Just one more hole to dig.

39:46.469 --> 39:48.888
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

40:04.279 --> 40:06.281
(MUFFLED CRIES)

40:09.200 --> 40:10.493
(PHONE BEEPS)

40:10.577 --> 40:12.162
(MOBILE RINGS)

40:14.622 --> 40:16.166
(MUFFLED SCREAMS)

40:27.594 --> 40:29.054
Yeah, you go.

40:29.137 --> 40:30.305
I'll finish up here.

40:36.978 --> 40:39.731
(GASPS)

40:40.940 --> 40:42.442
Sarah.

40:42.525 --> 40:44.069
Don't... Don't leave me.

40:47.530 --> 40:48.573
(MUFFLED CRIES)

40:49.866 --> 40:50.867
Mark!

40:53.995 --> 40:56.539
There you are, Isobel.
Together at last.

40:57.374 --> 40:58.625
JED: Mark!

41:21.898 --> 41:23.858
RYAN: Paramedics said
he'd been drinking.

41:25.777 --> 41:28.113
They think he choked
on his tongue.

41:30.365 --> 41:31.866
Bullshit.

41:31.950 --> 41:34.160
Yeah, well...

41:34.244 --> 41:35.912
As long as that's
what they're thinking.

41:38.957 --> 41:41.292
I could have stopped this,
you know.

41:41.376 --> 41:42.669
You tried.

41:46.506 --> 41:49.384
I told him to go.
I told him to get on
that bloody plane.

41:49.467 --> 41:51.678
Jed. You tried.

41:54.889 --> 41:57.267
Everywhere I go
it's always the same.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.020
What do you mean?

42:02.522 --> 42:05.233
People realise I'm a freak

42:05.316 --> 42:08.570
and they get scared of me,
they blame me
for stuff and then...

42:11.281 --> 42:13.450
And then I end up back inside.

42:17.996 --> 42:20.040
I just want a normal life,
you know.

42:25.003 --> 42:26.880
I'm never gonna have that,
am I?

43:14.886 --> 43:16.137
What's wrong, Kate?

43:18.640 --> 43:20.225
Nothing.

43:20.308 --> 43:21.810
Kate, talk to me.

43:23.603 --> 43:24.604
Nothing.

43:28.775 --> 43:32.153
Everything's fine.
Everything's okay.

43:33.613 --> 43:36.074
(SOBS) I need to
get away from here.

43:40.745 --> 43:41.746
What happened?

43:42.414 --> 43:43.415
Just...

43:44.666 --> 43:46.126
-I can't be here.
-Yeah.

43:46.209 --> 43:48.086
We'll leave, right?

43:48.169 --> 43:50.630
We'll leave, but you need
to tell me what happened.

43:50.714 --> 43:51.840
You were right.

43:53.633 --> 43:54.884
My dad.

43:58.555 --> 44:00.056
I'm gonna sort it out, okay?
