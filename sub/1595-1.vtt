02:51.367 --> 02:55.201
This T-shirt with this neck,

03:17.327 --> 03:19.283
< l've a few for you.

03:19.327 --> 03:21.716
Get some conditioner on that hair,

03:21.767 --> 03:24.076
and to lose weight, try less make-up.

03:24.127 --> 03:25.082
l was only asking.

03:25.127 --> 03:27.960
Like l'm only telling. Now fuck off!

- Cheers, Kev.

Are you epileptic?

07:31.687 --> 07:35.077
Oh, nothing like that in our family!

let people take advantage.

What happened here?

08:10.807 --> 08:13.924
Silver lining on a very murky day.

08:13.967 --> 08:15.161
Thanks for that, Kev.

08:15.207 --> 08:18.165
l thought you wanted
a live-in as the keyholder?

08:18.207 --> 08:21.279
She's a looker, she's homeless
and she's no big drinker.

08:21.327 --> 08:22.316
Yes, Frank.

08:22.367 --> 08:24.961
Pint and a couple of Es, Kev.

08:26.007 --> 08:30.046
Deliver us from evil, or grant us
the certainty of being caked enough

08:30.087 --> 08:33.557
to give not one iota of a fuck. Amen.

08:33.607 --> 08:35.837
Thank you.

08:39.366 --> 08:42.164
How can you live in
if you've just moved into a flat?

08:42.207 --> 08:44.880
Just rented it out.
Coupla young blokes over there.

08:44.927 --> 08:46.155
When did this happen?

08:46.207 --> 08:47.799
Just now.

08:47.847 --> 08:51.203
You got a job, accommodation,
and sub-let while l had a slash?

08:51.247 --> 08:53.715
You're making yourself sound old, Kev.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.485
Stay awake, won't you?

08:55.527 --> 08:57.722
Karen, we'll need a few tonics up the other end.

08:57.767 --> 09:00.600

09:23.447 --> 09:25.278
There!

09:25.327 --> 09:27.204
And you went back to bed?

09:27.247 --> 09:28.475
Only for an hour.

09:28.527 --> 09:31.724
Leave the kids here for an hour? Would you?

09:31.767 --> 09:35.077
l wouldn't, would l?

09:35.127 --> 09:37.482
Maybe l put 'em in the spare room!

09:37.527 --> 09:38.960
No, we've gone right round the house, Sheila.

09:39.007 --> 09:43.285
Oh God! Oh God! Where are you?
Where are you? Where are you?

09:48.847 --> 09:50.724
Who are you?

09:50.767 --> 09:54.555
Neville Gallagher. Their grandpa.
We've been for a stroll down t'shops.

09:54.607 --> 09:58.566
Oh, Neville, l'm so sorry.

09:58.607 --> 10:01.679
l thought l'd dreamt you.

10:01.727 --> 10:06.278
Oh, my babies! My lovely, darling babies!

10:06.327 --> 10:09.558

10:09.607 --> 10:10.676
l'm so sorry!

10:10.727 --> 10:14.037
Sheila, forget it. As long as the kids are OK.

10:14.087 --> 10:18.842
But you've all rushed round here
and called out the dogs and stuff.

10:18.887 --> 10:21.321
As long as they're safe, Sheila.

10:21.367 --> 10:25.406
We'll leave you to it.
l wish all these call-outs ended like this.

10:25.447 --> 10:29.201
Most of 'em don't, believe me!
Most are pretty gruesome.

10:29.247 --> 10:30.521

Would you like a...vodka?

10:39.847 --> 10:41.075
Nah, we'll leave you to it.

10:41.127 --> 10:43.197
Thank you, gentlemen.

10:44.407 --> 10:47.240
Don't let Frank know about this!

10:47.287 --> 10:50.006
Faster she gets sectioned,
sooner we can retire.

10:50.047 --> 10:52.845
Did you see the size of the dildos
under the bed?

10:52.887 --> 10:54.525
No wonder she can't see straight!

10:57.567 --> 10:59.285
Hiya.

11:00.687 --> 11:02.564
What you doing here?

11:02.607 --> 11:04.916

- Kev.

11:04.967 --> 11:07.037
- Nipped out.
- Did he leave me house keys?

11:07.087 --> 11:08.122
He did, yeah.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.964
Can l have 'em?

11:10.007 --> 11:12.840
lf l could remember where he put 'em...

11:12.887 --> 11:14.115
You haven't even looked.

11:14.167 --> 11:17.125
l'm not going to, the way you talk to me.

11:17.167 --> 11:21.001
Karen, give me the keys
unless you want a twatting.

11:21.047 --> 11:24.357
''Keys, please, Karen.''

11:24.407 --> 11:25.362
Fuck off!

11:25.407 --> 11:28.285
BOTH SCREAM

11:30.567 --> 11:31.920
Right, you. Out! You're barred!

11:31.967 --> 11:33.605
You can't bar me! My husband works here!

11:33.647 --> 11:36.161
Maybe he won't if you can't behave!

11:36.207 --> 11:40.883
Sorry, Jez. Won't happen again.
Cross me heart and hope to die.

13:02.487 --> 13:04.125
Yeah, not bad for a dead man, eh?

13:04.167 --> 13:05.725
What?

13:05.767 --> 13:08.281
Little joke of your dad's, apparently.

13:09.327 --> 13:12.125
Not much, but it's been thought through.

13:13.327 --> 13:17.525
Spending the winter in Benidorm's
the only time to see it,

13:17.567 --> 13:20.365

13:20.407 --> 13:21.396
There you go.

13:21.447 --> 13:22.800
Thanks!

13:22.847 --> 13:27.841
Now, all of these were actually MADE

13:27.887 --> 13:31.721
by good, honest, artisans.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.645
Locals working with their hands.

13:34.687 --> 13:36.757
What are you up to here, then?

13:36.807 --> 13:41.278
Steve and Fiona's house. We normally
need permission to go round there,

13:41.327 --> 13:45.400
- but you're allowed, definitely.

13:53.727 --> 13:55.718
Good lad.

13:57.167 --> 13:58.680
Here you go, Grand...

13:58.727 --> 14:00.638
Now you're spoiling me!

14:03.207 --> 14:05.675
Grandad. Brown sauce.

14:06.367 --> 14:10.724
Mug of tea, pint of lager and a bacon sarnie.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.679
l could still be in Spain!

14:13.727 --> 14:15.319
Quick, Fiona!

14:18.207 --> 14:20.004
- What?
- Hiya.

14:20.047 --> 14:22.845
Fuck have l told you
about coming round this side?

14:22.887 --> 14:25.242
< Language, language!

14:28.007 --> 14:30.043
When did you get back?

14:30.087 --> 14:31.076
Yesterday.

14:32.527 --> 14:35.166
Grandad, this is Steve.

14:36.207 --> 14:37.845
< l've heard a lot about you.

14:37.887 --> 14:39.002
You're a very lucky lad.

14:39.047 --> 14:41.720
That's what it feels like most days.

14:41.767 --> 14:46.318
l'm serious. He'll drive Sheila round the bend.

14:46.367 --> 14:48.119
Yeah, but we don't want him back.

14:48.167 --> 14:53.560
All l'm saying is, you need to make sure
she's getting some respite.

14:53.607 --> 14:55.518
She's not a well woman.

14:55.567 --> 14:57.523
She's happy enough.

14:57.567 --> 15:01.685
But as a favour to me,
you'd make an effort, wouldn't you?

15:03.727 --> 15:07.402
Fair dos, Neville.
We've got enough to worry about

15:07.447 --> 15:11.201
without thinking about Frank and Sheila.
All right?

15:11.247 --> 15:14.762
No offence, son. This is a family conversation.

15:21.007 --> 15:24.283
Fine. Like what?

15:24.327 --> 15:27.478
Sheila needs a babysitter tonight.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.677
l'll do it!

15:29.727 --> 15:30.716
Older than you.

15:30.767 --> 15:33.281
l could do a few hours.

15:33.327 --> 15:35.397
< Older than you.

15:37.047 --> 15:39.481
OK.

15:39.527 --> 15:42.485
You stay in, me and Steve'll go and sit.

15:42.527 --> 15:44.836
Cool. How long's Sheila gonna be?

15:44.887 --> 15:47.355
Ah... Depends...

15:49.167 --> 15:54.002
Depends where our Frank takes us for a meal.

15:54.207 --> 15:57.358
You can't barge in there nutting people!
Not women, anyway!

15:57.407 --> 16:02.242
l'll do it again if she talks to me like that,
the spoon-faced bitch!

16:02.287 --> 16:05.040
l'm as surprised as you are.
But l didn't get her the job.

16:05.087 --> 16:08.284
You lying fuck!
l watched you sniffing round her.

16:08.327 --> 16:13.117
lf l catch you within an inch
of that two-faced pan-faced magpie,

16:13.167 --> 16:16.000
- l'll cut your lumpy little dick off.
- l didn't get her the job!

16:16.047 --> 16:17.446
Well, l'm barred now!

16:17.487 --> 16:19.284
Not if you pay the fine.

16:19.327 --> 16:24.242
Like FUCK! That's my local,
she's on my patch. Get rid of her!

16:24.287 --> 16:26.881
Veronica! Be reasonable!

16:26.927 --> 16:32.240
l want that twisted little bitch's head
on a big fucking stick!

16:34.247 --> 16:37.000
Frank? Frank! >

16:42.927 --> 16:45.077
My God, what's happened to you?

16:45.127 --> 16:46.958
Gas Board van reversed into us.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.565
Not again!

16:51.647 --> 16:54.081
l'm doing fishcakes and l've forgotten -

16:54.127 --> 16:57.085
do you like 'em with or without the fish?

16:57.127 --> 17:00.119
We're going out for a meal.

17:00.167 --> 17:02.681
What do you mean?

17:03.727 --> 17:06.400
We're going out for a meal.

17:07.446 --> 17:08.846
l ca...

17:08.887 --> 17:12.846
l can't eat in front of other people, Frank.

17:13.847 --> 17:17.886
lt's not my idea. And it's not other people.

17:21.727 --> 17:23.718
Just me.

17:23.767 --> 17:25.962
Just me and me dad.

17:30.287 --> 17:34.485
l could wear that dress l bought online
for the millennium!

17:37.447 --> 17:40.996
Your mother was one of the finest
trade unionists that ever lived!

17:41.047 --> 17:45.086
She wiped the floor with Vic Feather,
and he thought he was somebody!

17:45.127 --> 17:50.759
She worshipped you. And made
the most pathetic excuses for you!

17:50.807 --> 17:53.799
l didn't realise you weren't autistic!

17:53.847 --> 17:59.922
Till you called me a cunt
in suspiciously fitting circumstances!

18:09.487 --> 18:11.000
Oi! Down here! >

18:12.687 --> 18:14.359
Here!

18:17.167 --> 18:21.126
Fuck's sake! She'll bar you permanently
if she sees you.

18:21.167 --> 18:23.362
So she won't.

18:25.327 --> 18:26.316
Yes, ladies?

18:26.367 --> 18:29.439
- We're sorted, thanks, love.
- Spoon-faced slapper!

18:29.487 --> 18:31.398
What did you say?

18:31.447 --> 18:35.042
He said it's his birthday,
he's never felt happier.

18:44.607 --> 18:46.882
Gallagher for three.

19:01.967 --> 19:05.084
l mentioned on the phone
we'll eat absolutely anything

19:05.127 --> 19:09.120
but ideally l'd like a prune and vodka sorbet

19:09.167 --> 19:13.843
with custard on a side plate for pudding.
lf you do one. At all.

19:13.887 --> 19:16.037
Thank you.

19:32.527 --> 19:34.119
She's getting all Kev's tips!

19:34.167 --> 19:35.919
Give over, it's only coppers.

19:35.967 --> 19:40.119
Yeah, 25 quid a week in coppers!
She's only been here a fucking day.

19:40.167 --> 19:44.240
Keep your voice down! You won't
last long enough to finish your drink!

19:50.527 --> 19:53.041
Shit!

19:55.367 --> 19:57.358
Merci, merci.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.202
Very good lamb, in't it, Neville?

20:25.247 --> 20:29.126
Cooked by a man
who knows the landscape, Sheila.

20:29.167 --> 20:31.727
Rosemary, mint and...?

20:31.767 --> 20:33.962
Um...

20:34.007 --> 20:34.996
Port, l think!

20:35.047 --> 20:36.036
Correct.

20:36.087 --> 20:37.725
Oh, thank you!

20:37.767 --> 20:42.841
When l bought this dress,
l never imagined it'd see the light of day.

20:42.887 --> 20:47.039
Fortnight back, it was nearly cushions!
So l'm thrilled!

20:47.087 --> 20:50.841
Whatever! l just don't see the point
of paying for food.

20:50.887 --> 20:54.960
lt's not for you. lt's a gift for the lady wife
for all her hard work.

20:55.007 --> 20:57.999
The point is, you are paying for it.

21:00.367 --> 21:01.356
Mine or yours?

21:01.407 --> 21:04.956
All three. To celebrate the fact
you start work next week.

21:05.007 --> 21:08.716
- As what?
- We'll have to wait and see. Won't we?

21:12.007 --> 21:13.884
SlREN WAlLS

21:14.847 --> 21:18.283
How much is that slapper in the bike shed?

21:18.327 --> 21:20.795
The one with the arse like a whale

21:20.847 --> 21:24.044
They reckon she sucks and she swallows

21:24.087 --> 21:25.236
And her na-me is Abigail!

21:25.287 --> 21:26.356
Dickhead!

21:26.407 --> 21:27.999
How's it hanging, Abi?

21:28.047 --> 21:31.084
Chubby chops! Chubby salty chops!

21:36.447 --> 21:38.961
Who let you off your fucking lead?

21:51.687 --> 21:53.279
- All right?
- All right.

22:07.847 --> 22:09.439
How many hours?

22:09.487 --> 22:13.366
Four on the first day, just to break us in.

22:13.407 --> 22:14.362
How many houses?

22:14.407 --> 22:16.238
1 0, 1 5. >

22:16.287 --> 22:20.838
Big houses up Sandown Cross.
Totally knackering.

22:20.887 --> 22:23.959
Feel me arms. New muscles.

22:24.007 --> 22:25.759
You look completely different, Frank.

22:25.807 --> 22:28.002
lt's been an eye-opener.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.242
Gaffer reckons l'm a natural.

22:30.287 --> 22:33.916
See! How much better do you feel
for an honest day?

22:33.967 --> 22:35.844
You're right, Dad.

22:35.887 --> 22:38.526
l've got blood going everywhere. Fingers, toes.

22:38.567 --> 22:41.240
l could seriously get to like it.

22:41.287 --> 22:43.323
< What did l tell you?

22:43.367 --> 22:46.200
Wake the dead! l said l was determined.

22:46.247 --> 22:51.799
So how can you do a round
if you haven't got a van?

22:51.847 --> 22:57.683
Gaffer picks us up, drops us
at various sites up and down...

22:57.727 --> 23:03.279
and then, er, we all meet for a fry-up at midday.

23:03.327 --> 23:05.921
Great lads. Cracking banter.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.083
l think they can't believe it

23:08.127 --> 23:11.358
cos l get on with ALL of 'em.
Band of brothers and that.

23:11.407 --> 23:14.558
Why doesn't he just keep
the ladders in the van?

23:14.607 --> 23:17.804
Will you fuck off and leave us alone?!

23:17.847 --> 23:22.796
l ju... You know...cos... l can't think here.

23:22.847 --> 23:24.838
He's exhausted!

23:24.887 --> 23:27.276
Let's get you home and fed.

23:27.327 --> 23:31.366
Well, look after yourself, Dad.
Don't leave it so long next time.

23:31.407 --> 23:32.920
No...

23:32.967 --> 23:36.880
lt looks as if l'll be in your hair
for a while longer.

23:38.247 --> 23:42.001
l've offered Neville our Karen's room
while his flat's painted.

23:42.047 --> 23:44.925
And very kind you are, too.

23:47.647 --> 23:50.719
He's bringing all his photo albums
to show the twins.

23:51.607 --> 23:54.360
l'm bidding for a photocopier on eBay...

23:54.407 --> 23:58.116
which closes in half an hour,
so l'd better get a move on.

23:59.567 --> 24:01.523
How... How long for?

24:01.567 --> 24:04.240
Only a week or so from Tuesday.

24:04.287 --> 24:07.723
'Cept you know what the council's like...

24:07.767 --> 24:09.883
Think of a number and double it.

24:11.447 --> 24:14.280
Fine. l'll just...

24:14.327 --> 24:16.318
SOBBlNG

24:24.647 --> 24:25.636
SHE KNOCKS

24:30.807 --> 24:33.241
You're gonna need a bit of help, aren't you?

24:51.167 --> 24:53.635
There's a barrel wants changing, Kev.

25:01.887 --> 25:05.197
Don't spend too long talking to the lads.

25:06.447 --> 25:08.961
Which lads?

25:10.007 --> 25:12.885
Any lads.

25:14.367 --> 25:15.356
Yes, love.

25:15.407 --> 25:16.840
Pint of bitter, please. >

25:16.887 --> 25:18.764
Veronica, you look a dick. >

25:18.807 --> 25:20.160
Dirty old bastard! >

25:20.207 --> 25:22.118
Don't use her name.

25:22.167 --> 25:24.317
Sorry. She's here!

25:25.007 --> 25:27.646
l've just realised who you remind me of.

25:27.687 --> 25:30.326
Remember that bloke on the way to school?

25:30.367 --> 25:33.598
When we got level he used to get his knob out?

25:36.047 --> 25:40.199
Right, Veronica, last warning, let's have you!

25:58.567 --> 26:02.446
Bit of a temperature,
and she says she's feeling a bit queasy.

26:02.487 --> 26:03.681
Ooh, you're burning up!

26:03.727 --> 26:06.605
Shops aren't open yet.
Have you got any aspirin?

26:06.647 --> 26:09.844
l don't think so. But as luck would have it...

26:09.887 --> 26:11.718
made a Martini sorbet yesterday.

26:11.767 --> 26:15.521
Oh, sorry,
l think l might have had that last night.

26:24.887 --> 26:26.798
Ah, she's not well!

26:28.407 --> 26:30.602
Can l walk to work with you, Dad?

26:30.647 --> 26:31.636
No!

26:31.687 --> 26:33.279
What?

26:33.327 --> 26:38.720
Oh, yeah... What... Yeah, all right.
Wave me off.

26:43.327 --> 26:45.283
He's still there.

26:46.927 --> 26:49.566
He's watching us!

26:49.607 --> 26:52.041
< Just trust me.

26:52.087 --> 26:54.157
lf he finds out, he'll have me.

26:54.207 --> 26:59.156
Stop looking so obvious and he won't.
Talk to him. Talk to him!

27:03.247 --> 27:05.317
All right, mate.

27:05.367 --> 27:07.927
FRANK SlMULATES A CONVERSATlON

27:18.167 --> 27:20.442
Over there now! Go! Quick!

27:50.487 --> 27:52.205
People are complaining about your ladders.

27:52.247 --> 27:55.319
They can have 'em!
When's the meat and tattie pie ready?

27:55.367 --> 27:56.561
Can you afford it?

27:56.607 --> 27:59.326
Our Debbie's subbed us.

27:59.367 --> 28:02.518
How long do you think you can camp out here?

28:02.567 --> 28:06.526
Six nights and seven more days!
l can't get shot of him!

28:06.567 --> 28:11.083
Wouldn't it be easier to actually GET a job
till your dad's gone?

28:15.727 --> 28:18.116
l'll bring your pie over when it's ready.

28:18.167 --> 28:20.237
With the right change!

28:32.367 --> 28:33.686
What time is it?

28:33.727 --> 28:36.241
Half past seven.

28:36.287 --> 28:38.357
But look at this!

28:38.407 --> 28:42.241
Your mother when she first worked
as a clippie on the buses!

28:43.967 --> 28:46.197
That could be you in a skirt!

28:50.287 --> 28:52.403
How much do you look like her?

28:52.447 --> 28:55.598
Wakey-wakey, working man! >

28:55.647 --> 28:59.196

TOlLET FLUSHES

29:06.327 --> 29:07.726
Fuel for the worker!

29:07.767 --> 29:12.158
Workers. All mothers are workers,
and that's a fact.

29:14.287 --> 29:19.645
Formally acknowledged in the
TUC Women's Charter of 1 983, etcetera.

29:21.287 --> 29:23.357
Anyway, thank you for the tea.

29:38.527 --> 29:41.644
Oh my God! Are you sure you don't need me?

29:41.687 --> 29:44.201
Give over! Put your feet up, take your tablets.

29:44.247 --> 29:46.761
l think l'd better!

29:48.807 --> 29:50.798
C'mon, c'mon!

29:50.847 --> 29:52.883
Got a test today. l'd best get to school.

29:52.927 --> 29:54.963
Fuck's sake, don't let him see you.

29:55.007 --> 29:56.406
Have you got that tenner you borrowed?

29:56.447 --> 29:58.915
Have l fuck! Pay you Friday.

30:05.767 --> 30:07.200
They're still being breast-fed.

30:07.247 --> 30:11.923
l know! But they can look, can't they?!

30:11.967 --> 30:15.926
l'll get that washing-up done before l shoot off.
See you, Dad!

30:52.367 --> 30:55.643
FOOTSTEPS

31:01.287 --> 31:06.407
Nothing better to do, so l thought
l'd give you and the lads a hand.

31:06.447 --> 31:08.438
No.

31:08.487 --> 31:10.842
Yeah, but l'm...

31:10.887 --> 31:13.685
They want me down this side today.

31:13.727 --> 31:15.718
Kind of...

31:15.767 --> 31:19.237

31:19.287 --> 31:21.881
So soon?

31:21.927 --> 31:23.645
Congratulations. >

31:25.927 --> 31:29.237
Right, let's get tucked in, then.

Fuck are you up to?

31:34.607 --> 31:37.519
l'm doing your windows, Lilian, love.

31:37.567 --> 31:41.560
Just help us out! Just let it ride!

31:41.607 --> 31:45.759
Bugger off! We lost two tellies
and a PlayStation last month,

31:45.807 --> 31:49.925
and l can't get insurance any more!
l'm going to phone the police!

31:49.967 --> 31:51.878
Lilian, love... Oh!

31:53.167 --> 31:54.964
SHE MOUTHS

31:55.007 --> 31:59.558
Hey, hey, hey! Fuck's sake!
Me stomach's doing somersaults here!

31:59.607 --> 32:05.955
You filthy, scummy, bone-idle little shite!

32:08.967 --> 32:12.960
Hey, no, come on. Cut it out, Dad,
you'll break me neck!

32:13.007 --> 32:17.717
Two minutes after you were born,
they let me cut the cord.

32:17.767 --> 32:20.964
One of the proudest moments of my life.

32:21.007 --> 32:24.044
lf l'd known what a fucking heretic you'd be,

32:24.087 --> 32:26.999
l'd have let you bleed to death right there!

32:27.047 --> 32:28.196
Dad!

32:30.007 --> 32:34.637
When your mother died,
she made me promise l'd take care of you.

32:34.687 --> 32:37.440
So l WlLL!

32:37.487 --> 32:39.557
Sorry! Sorry!

32:39.607 --> 32:42.075
You killed her!

32:42.127 --> 32:46.882
She's up there now,
cursing her own fucking womb!

32:46.927 --> 32:49.885
With good men and women
standing beside her!

32:49.927 --> 32:52.316
And going...

33:02.967 --> 33:04.446
HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

33:22.167 --> 33:24.203
You're still pay-as-you-go!

33:25.767 --> 33:27.962
Meaning...

33:28.007 --> 33:31.124
no pay, no go!

33:31.447 --> 33:33.722
You're out of credit!

33:39.447 --> 33:42.041
You...

33:42.087 --> 33:46.638
You vicious, mean,

33:46.687 --> 33:49.963
up-your-own-arse old man.

33:51.687 --> 33:53.643
And them's not my words.

33:53.687 --> 33:55.917
That's what me mam used to call you.

33:56.967 --> 33:59.356
Yeah! Yeah!

33:59.407 --> 34:03.559
Other things that made us both smile were
''sanctimonious old goat''

34:03.607 --> 34:05.837
and ''devious old cunt''.

34:10.246 --> 34:12.966
Cos she knew

34:13.007 --> 34:15.885
she was BETTER than you!

34:15.927 --> 34:19.123
So did everybody in the TUC.

34:19.167 --> 34:23.319
Three years younger
and flying way beyond you.

34:23.367 --> 34:26.199
Which is the only reason you got...

34:28.167 --> 34:30.556
..that you got her pregnant!

34:31.887 --> 34:35.721
That's the only reason you smiled
when l was born!

34:39.567 --> 34:42.206
Cos you knew you'd slowed her down.

34:47.766 --> 34:50.121
BlTTER LAUGHTER

34:50.167 --> 34:54.445
You know my only promise to Mam
before she died? Eh?

34:55.567 --> 34:58.718
l'd have you cremated.

34:58.767 --> 35:03.283
Cos she knew how much you wanted
to be buried for us all to blub over.

35:03.327 --> 35:08.321
Then bury your ashes round the toilet
block of the Conservative Club.

35:10.447 --> 35:13.166
Which l promised,

35:13.207 --> 35:17.644
so l fucking will!

35:41.807 --> 35:43.445
Oi!

35:43.487 --> 35:46.445
ln your corner, Mitzi.

35:47.487 --> 35:49.557
< Get your hands off my lager,

35:49.607 --> 35:52.519
and get the fuck out of my house.

35:52.567 --> 35:56.276
Karen bought that for you, along with the rest.

36:01.927 --> 36:05.966
The only reason l got the job
is Jez thinks l'm gay.

36:06.007 --> 36:09.636
l'm not interested in a bloke
with that much hair.

36:10.287 --> 36:14.803
You're trying to get her the sack
and she's done fuck-all wrong.

36:14.847 --> 36:19.079
Except for defending myself
when you have a go, which l apologise for.

36:19.127 --> 36:23.962
l'll get your suspension lifted
and l'll knock a few bob off your bill.

36:24.007 --> 36:28.922
And all my tips are gonna
be shared with Kev 50-50.

36:36.207 --> 36:39.005
Yeah, l'm sorry and all.

36:39.047 --> 36:42.039
Jockey tonight? Me own clothes?

36:42.087 --> 36:46.080
See, this is what she's like
after we've had a barney.

36:46.127 --> 36:50.518
Calls me a spack with a lumpy little dick
and thinks ''sorry'' is enough.

36:50.567 --> 36:51.920
Don't know what you're on about.

36:51.967 --> 36:53.480
lt's Jez that needs convincing.

36:53.527 --> 36:57.042
So you're far from out the fuckin' woods,
Gobby Bear.

37:00.687 --> 37:02.245
Ah, fuck!

37:02.287 --> 37:05.723
Jez? Can l nip to the loo while it's quiet?

37:05.767 --> 37:09.362
Course you can, sweetheart.
What can l get you?

37:09.407 --> 37:13.764
Jez, do you mind if l nip for a slash
while it's quiet?

37:13.807 --> 37:16.401
Not one of your long 'uns.

37:20.007 --> 37:24.523
Back in a sec. lf you help yourself,
l'll cut your hands off.

37:24.567 --> 37:26.125
lt's a waste if you ask me.

37:28.327 --> 37:30.522
lt's not my fault! She dived on me!

37:30.567 --> 37:32.842
You filthy two-timing cow!

37:32.887 --> 37:35.720
Don't tell Kev, Jez. God, please!

37:35.767 --> 37:37.758
Back to work, you.

37:39.967 --> 37:44.722
l might have known! The hypocrites
l've put up with! lt's always women!

37:44.767 --> 37:47.918
l'll drink down The Butterfly.
You can bar me forever.

37:47.967 --> 37:49.798
Just don't tell Kev.

37:51.407 --> 37:53.045
So what d'you think, then?

37:53.087 --> 37:54.884
Dunno.

37:54.927 --> 37:56.645
She's a foxy little tinker, in't she, our Karen?

37:56.687 --> 37:58.723
Well, yeah!

37:58.767 --> 38:03.079
lt's never happened to me before.
She makes me fanny go all wavy.

38:03.127 --> 38:07.086
Touch her again, you'll have me to answer to.

38:07.127 --> 38:09.436
Might not be a bad thing. >

38:09.487 --> 38:12.877
Tidy yourself up and l'll pay you a drink on.

38:23.247 --> 38:26.364
l've got the biggest hard-on you've ever seen.

38:28.407 --> 38:31.126
Get in here, you dirty bitch!

38:31.167 --> 38:33.158
SHE CHUCKLES

38:36.887 --> 38:40.641
l pumped his chest and blew in his...thingy

38:40.687 --> 38:43.963
till the ambulance arrived.

38:44.007 --> 38:47.044
And l said, ''Can l go with him?''

38:47.087 --> 38:49.396
They said, ''No. No point, mate.''

38:49.447 --> 38:53.759
Steve, get over here now.
l need a lift. Where did they take him?

38:55.327 --> 38:58.285
Fuck do l know! They just drove off...

39:00.687 --> 39:02.837
l'll tell you when you get here.

39:05.087 --> 39:05.917
lt's an ambulance.

39:05.967 --> 39:09.118
l know! l want to know where it took him!

39:09.167 --> 39:11.601
No, here. There's an ambulance here.

39:11.647 --> 39:13.080
What for?

39:31.127 --> 39:33.960
Guess who's not dead! Again!

39:37.687 --> 39:39.564
Hiatus hernia.

39:39.607 --> 39:44.203
They slugged me full of antacids
and it faded like a bad dream.

39:44.247 --> 39:47.762
ln and out of casualty
in less than seven hours. >

39:47.807 --> 39:50.082
Pretty good for a free service. >

39:50.127 --> 39:51.640
You look good to me. >

39:51.687 --> 39:55.726
You look wonderful, Neville.
We thought you'd died!

40:05.367 --> 40:09.406
lmagine how you'd feel if you thought
your dad was dead and he wasn't!

40:09.447 --> 40:12.837
l wouldn't...l know, Sheila, shocking!

40:13.887 --> 40:18.642
Medical staff said you were to be commended
on all your first aid.

40:19.687 --> 40:20.676
Yeah?

40:20.727 --> 40:24.606
Very much so. Witnesses testified.

40:24.647 --> 40:27.115
That so?

40:32.167 --> 40:33.486
So...

40:40.127 --> 40:43.119
You take back every single word.

40:43.167 --> 40:45.476
Ha ha ha! Get fucked!

40:46.647 --> 40:48.126
She totally worshipped me. >

40:48.167 --> 40:51.284
She used to piss in your bait box.

40:52.327 --> 40:55.763
Oof! Don't overdo it!
We don't want a repeat, do we?

40:57.327 --> 41:01.843
He wants to go back to his own flat.
Bit excited about the paint job.

41:03.847 --> 41:08.967
(Shelia) 'Being an only child,
l was touched by the warmth of the big family.

41:09.007 --> 41:10.963
'l loved it.'

41:12.887 --> 41:15.321
Eric, your new temporary foster parents.

41:15.367 --> 41:17.278
Veronica and Kelvin Ball.

41:17.327 --> 41:21.400
From now on,
we've just got to try really hard not to kill him.

41:21.447 --> 41:22.357
Eric?

41:22.407 --> 41:24.602
Don't! You'll flood the engine!

41:24.647 --> 41:26.922
Green Cherokee, Easton Street.

41:26.967 --> 41:29.197
You've been caught on CCTV, Steve.

41:29.247 --> 41:31.158
- Whose is it?
- Chief lnspector's.

41:31.207 --> 41:34.404
Do you remember school?
The fucking cannibal.

41:35.967 --> 41:40.119
You can't snatch your kid and expect
to get away with it, you daft sod!

41:40.167 --> 41:41.156
lt were turning him over!

41:41.207 --> 41:43.038
Fucking shit!

41:43.087 --> 41:45.920
lt's not funny, Steve. He's freaking me out.

41:45.967 --> 41:48.686
l keep dreaming about the house on fire!

41:48.727 --> 41:51.560
CHEERlNG

42:32.207 --> 42:36.280
Whatever Frank and Sheila are having
and a quick Scotch for me.

42:40.487 --> 42:42.478
This is on me, son.

43:01.527 --> 43:02.755
Tell you what, Dad...

43:02.807 --> 43:05.401
Stick it right up your arse.

43:05.447 --> 43:07.483
No, Frank...

43:07.527 --> 43:09.324
l did that before l came in here.

43:11.527 --> 43:13.483
Cheers!

43:13.527 --> 43:15.722
Drinks are on Frank.
