Rip the tusks out.

00:06.283 --> 00:07.648
This is disgusting.

00:07.718 --> 00:09.811
l say we go in there
and skin them poachers.

00:09.887 --> 00:11.149
So we're going to Kenya.

00:11.922 --> 00:13.355
[tires screeching]

00:14.858 --> 00:16.621
Don't know
who you're dealing with.

00:16.694 --> 00:17.752
A disease.

00:18.228 --> 00:21.288
This is your roots.
This is dirt, fool.

00:21.398 --> 00:23.628
We'll just see
how really good they are.

00:28.973 --> 00:31.771
Yeah, they don't make
the bad guys
like they used to, do they?

00:33.811 --> 00:36.405
(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:36.480 --> 00:38.311
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:38.382 --> 00:39.872
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:39.950 --> 00:41.315
These men promptly escaped...

00:41.385 --> 00:42.909
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:42.987 --> 00:44.249
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:44.321 --> 00:46.084
Today,
still wanted
by the government...

00:46.156 --> 00:47.953
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

00:48.025 --> 00:50.493
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

00:50.561 --> 00:51.994
and if you can find them...

00:52.062 --> 00:54.053
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

Horton, go check the traps.

02:53.517 --> 02:56.350
Steele spotted
a pride of lions
coming up from the river.

03:10.667 --> 03:13.067
You're under arrest.
Drop your weapons.

03:18.709 --> 03:21.269
This is a government
animal preserve.

03:21.345 --> 03:25.145
All of the animals
are protected by law,
and you are all under arrest.

03:25.215 --> 03:26.773
We were just doing
a little hunting.

03:26.850 --> 03:29.114
You've been
poaching this area
for over two weeks now.

03:29.186 --> 03:31.518
And l've come across
more than 40 carcasses.

03:31.755 --> 03:33.484
And l've spotted your tracks.

03:34.024 --> 03:35.150
Don't move.

03:36.793 --> 03:37.919
Any of you.

03:46.270 --> 03:49.501
This is Rover Two to Base.
Rover Two to Base.

03:53.310 --> 03:54.868
l swear,
l'll drop you right here.

03:54.945 --> 03:57.539
'Cause l got the authority
and the motivation.

(Kamarra)
Rover One to Rover Two.
Come in, Kim.

03:59.950 --> 04:01.918
I'm out in the field.
What's going on?

04:01.985 --> 04:04.146
l've got them, Kamarra.
lt is Madrid.

04:04.221 --> 04:05.449
Do you want me
to come help?

04:05.522 --> 04:08.355
No.
l'm going to take them
right into Mbabwe...

04:08.725 --> 04:11.023
and send them over
to the constabulary.

04:11.261 --> 04:13.695
Hopefully, we can find out
who they're working for.

Kim!

Kim!

04:28.845 --> 04:30.403

06:14.685 --> 06:16.653
Excuse me, l wanted to go up.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.086
Not if you're looking
for the A-Team, ma'am.

06:35.405 --> 06:36.963
Thanks, Murdock.

06:37.774 --> 06:40.402
Allow me to introduce you.
This is Templeton Peck...

06:40.477 --> 06:42.172
the guy with the hat
is Murdock...

06:42.245 --> 06:44.304
the big fellow there
is B.A. Baracus.

06:44.381 --> 06:45.814
Very pleased
to meet you.

06:45.882 --> 06:47.509
l'm sorry
about this elaborate ruse...

06:47.584 --> 06:49.711
but we had to be sure
you are who you say you are.

06:49.786 --> 06:51.720
We're sorry to hear
about your brother.

06:51.788 --> 06:53.255
Mr. Lee told us.

06:54.124 --> 06:56.684
My brother and l have spent
our entire lives...

06:56.760 --> 06:59.524
trying to stop
the senseless slaughtering
of the animals.

06:59.596 --> 07:03.054
lt's been
a near impossible task,
with funds being restricted.

07:03.133 --> 07:06.728
Two wardens
for hundreds of acres
and thousands of animals...

07:06.803 --> 07:10.068
but Kim was determined.
So determined, he's dead.

07:10.207 --> 07:11.674
Now let's sit down.

07:12.309 --> 07:15.767
You, uh, told Mr. Lee
the poachers
killed your brother.

07:15.946 --> 07:17.311
They did.

07:17.381 --> 07:20.475
l can't prove it,
but l know they did.

07:21.718 --> 07:24.687
The local constable
has written it off
as an accident.

07:24.755 --> 07:26.416
And those men
have continued poaching.

07:26.490 --> 07:27.821
Well,
l should think they would.

07:27.891 --> 07:30.883
The ivory from the elephant
tusks alone would make it
worth their while.

07:30.961 --> 07:33.657
Yeah, averaging, uh,
30 pounds a tusk...

07:33.730 --> 07:37.257
with the going rate
in the Hong Kong market
of $100 a pound...

07:37.334 --> 07:39.268
say you get
40 tusks a day...

07:39.336 --> 07:44.171
that comes out
to, um, $1 20,000.

07:44.474 --> 07:46.271
Which isn't bad
for a day's work.

07:46.343 --> 07:48.311
But we're not detectives,
Miss Keboko.

07:48.378 --> 07:51.108
l mean, if the local
authorities couldn't prove
Madrid and his men...

07:51.181 --> 07:53.513
were the murderers,
what do you expect us to do?

07:53.583 --> 07:56.279
l want you to protect
what my brother
gave his life for.

07:56.353 --> 07:59.481
lf they continue to destroy
everything he stood
and fought for...

07:59.656 --> 08:01.055
his death meant nothing.

08:01.224 --> 08:04.022
Hey, man,
l say we go in there
and skin them poachers.

08:05.796 --> 08:07.491
So you'll take the job?

08:07.731 --> 08:10.564
Uh, Kenya is a big country.
And, um...

08:11.001 --> 08:13.765
finding a couple of poachers
wouldn't be that easy a job.

08:13.837 --> 08:15.395
Not to mention expensive.

08:15.472 --> 08:18.441
With food, rooms, supplies,
travel arrangements--

08:18.508 --> 08:21.238
The four of you can stay
at the animal preserve.

08:21.945 --> 08:23.572
l've got some money
that l saved...

08:23.647 --> 08:26.673
to send
my brother to school
here in the United States.

08:28.051 --> 08:30.076
l won't be needing it anymore.

08:30.854 --> 08:32.253
lt's about $5,000.

08:32.823 --> 08:34.791
l couldn't think of
a better way to spend it...

08:34.857 --> 08:37.190
than to bring my brother's
killers to justice.

08:37.260 --> 08:38.989
$5,000. That's--

08:39.062 --> 08:40.893
That's more than enough.

08:41.097 --> 08:42.121
[clearing throat]

08:42.198 --> 08:45.134
$5,000 won't even cover
airfare to Kenya
for the four of us.

08:45.202 --> 08:46.260
l know.

08:46.336 --> 08:47.701
Can you go to Kenya?

08:47.771 --> 08:49.204
Sure, we can go to Kenya.

08:49.272 --> 08:52.366
l can see it now, that expanse
of African plain...

08:52.542 --> 08:54.942
the full moon, rising...

08:55.011 --> 08:56.808
then out of the darkness....

08:58.248 --> 09:00.842
[growling]

09:06.356 --> 09:09.348
Of course,
we do have one problem,
though.

09:10.527 --> 09:12.961
We're going to have
to fly to Kenya.

09:13.029 --> 09:16.396
And B.A. is, well,
he's not that fond
of airplanes.

09:16.466 --> 09:18.195
What you talking about, man?

09:18.268 --> 09:20.498
Ah, well, you know,
uh, you're, uh....

09:20.570 --> 09:21.559
Scared.

09:21.638 --> 09:24.471
The word is scared.
Scared. You scared to fly.

09:24.541 --> 09:26.975
Huh, me?
Scared of flying?

09:27.677 --> 09:29.645
That's just an act
l put on sometimes.

09:29.846 --> 09:31.643
l ain't afraid of nothing.

09:32.983 --> 09:35.508
Great. There's a flight
that leaves tonight.

09:36.019 --> 09:37.782
[mimicking
elephant trumpeting]

09:44.494 --> 09:45.893
[people chattering]

09:45.962 --> 09:47.589
Well, how're you feeling,
B.A.?

09:47.664 --> 09:48.722
Fine, man.

09:49.332 --> 09:53.496
There ain't no reason
on this earth why you
shouldn't feel fine, big guy.

09:53.570 --> 09:56.835
l can't imagine
the excitement that must be
pulsing through your veins.

09:56.907 --> 09:58.306
Do you know
where you're going?

09:58.375 --> 09:59.842
Does he know
where he's going?

09:59.910 --> 10:03.402
You're going to your homeland.
You going back home.
To Kenya.

10:03.480 --> 10:06.381
lt's the homeland
of your great-great-
great-granddaddy.

10:06.449 --> 10:08.474
And l can't tell you
how happy l am for you.

10:08.552 --> 10:12.044
l can't wait to see
the expression on your face
when you get off the plane.

10:12.122 --> 10:14.386
Plane?
Plane. Jumbo.

10:14.591 --> 10:16.354
Four big engines.

10:16.426 --> 10:19.623
60 million pounds
of thrust at full throttle.

10:19.696 --> 10:21.755
You really like to fly.
Oh, l love to fly.

10:21.831 --> 10:23.560
Yeah, l love flying, too.

10:23.633 --> 10:25.362
Do you really? You ain't
kidding me, are you?

10:25.435 --> 10:26.493
'Cause if you
love to fly...

10:26.570 --> 10:29.368
that means we have
something to converse about
when we get on the plane.

10:29.439 --> 10:30.531
l mean,
you just think about it.

10:30.607 --> 10:33.167
There ain't nothing between
you and the outside world...

10:33.243 --> 10:37.907
but one little piece of sheet
metal as you're traveling
at 600 miles an hour.

10:37.981 --> 10:40.279
And there ain't
almost nothing
that can go wrong.

10:40.350 --> 10:43.945
l mean, if you lost three
out of four of your engines,
that baby could still land.

10:44.020 --> 10:45.578
And if the fourth engine
caught fire...

10:45.655 --> 10:48.123
there'd be an
automatic fire extinguisher
to put the fire out.

10:48.191 --> 10:50.159
And those babies
almost never explode.

10:50.226 --> 10:54.390
Even though there is
almost 100,000 gallons
of fuel in the wings.

11:05.408 --> 11:07.876
(B.A.)
l felt the wheels
leave the ground, Hannibal.

11:07.944 --> 11:09.809
l felt the wheels
leave the ground.

11:09.879 --> 11:11.278
(Hannibal)
Calm down, B.A., so did l.

11:11.348 --> 11:12.645
That's not at all
unusual.

11:12.716 --> 11:13.808
We're in the air.

11:13.883 --> 11:15.475
(Murdock)
Standard procedure, big guy.

11:15.552 --> 11:16.951
The captain shoves
those throttles forward

11:17.020 --> 11:19.147
and two million pounds
of ramjet thrust shudders--

11:19.222 --> 11:21.747
(B.A.)
Shut up, Murdock. Shut up.
l'm getting out of here now.

11:21.825 --> 11:22.883
[clattering]
(Hannibal)
Sit down, B.A.

11:22.959 --> 11:25.086
Let go of me!
l don't want to!

11:25.762 --> 11:27.195
l told you to bring
his medication.

11:27.430 --> 11:28.419
Hurry.

11:28.698 --> 11:30.097
(Murdock)
Easy, big guy, easy.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.065
(Face)
What's going on here?

11:32.135 --> 11:34.103
[people clamoring]

11:34.371 --> 11:36.100
You gotta hold him.
(Hannibal)
Hold still.

11:37.474 --> 11:38.771
Easy, easy.

11:39.409 --> 11:40.933
[crashing continues]

11:42.846 --> 11:45.474
There you go.
Didn't hurt a bit. See?

11:48.184 --> 11:49.173
[crashing]

11:49.653 --> 11:53.214
l love it when B.A.
comes together. To sleep.

12:15.211 --> 12:17.304
[grunting]

12:20.183 --> 12:21.707
[gibbering]

12:22.952 --> 12:24.476
Hey, Hannibal!

12:24.554 --> 12:26.021
Get this thing off me.

12:28.591 --> 12:32.288
Kong, come here.
Don't bother the nice man.

12:32.362 --> 12:34.626
[birds chirping]
First we find out
you afraid to fly.

12:34.698 --> 12:36.962
Then we find out
you afraid of simians.

12:37.033 --> 12:38.261
Monkeys.

12:38.334 --> 12:40.359
Why didn't you just say
you were afraid to fly?

12:40.437 --> 12:43.201
l ain't afraid to fly.
l ain't afraid of no monkeys,
either.

12:43.273 --> 12:46.367
This is Kong. He belongs
to the animal preserve.

12:46.509 --> 12:47.976
Poachers shot his mother.

12:48.044 --> 12:50.137
l think he looks
kind of, kind of cute.

12:50.513 --> 12:52.208
Why don't you get to know him?

12:52.282 --> 12:55.410
[Muttering}
Get.... Get that thing
away from me.

12:56.019 --> 12:58.886
Well, that's the worst case
of jet lag l've ever seen.

12:58.955 --> 13:01.048
Look, B.A.,
let me show you how it's done.

13:01.124 --> 13:04.025
All you got to do
is open up your arms
and say, ''Come here, baby.''

13:04.094 --> 13:05.152
[Kong chattering]

13:05.228 --> 13:06.661
Now, see how easy that is?

13:06.730 --> 13:09.460
Yeah, that's because you both
have the same lQ.

13:09.866 --> 13:13.267
Face, that Amsterdam shipment
is exactly what you ordered.

13:13.336 --> 13:15.167
l put the grenades
in your room.

13:16.473 --> 13:17.565
All right.

13:19.676 --> 13:20.665
Now...

13:21.444 --> 13:25.312
according to Kamarra,
there've been three hits
here by the Cherangani hills.

13:25.381 --> 13:27.781
The elephant herds
often stop for water...

13:28.852 --> 13:31.650
here, at the Kendu Reservoir.
They've found
three carcasses there.

13:31.721 --> 13:33.279
Now the poachers
trail the herds...

13:33.356 --> 13:35.119
and then attack
when they're by water...

13:35.191 --> 13:36.852
'cause the animals
usually stop there.

13:36.926 --> 13:38.188
Sometimes
for a couple of days.

13:38.261 --> 13:39.785
How are they
finding the herds?

13:39.863 --> 13:43.264
Kim always thought that
they were doing it by air.
Otherwise, the poachers...

13:43.333 --> 13:46.598
would have to track too long
and they'd risk getting caught
by our patrols.

13:46.669 --> 13:49.695
We'd do it by air,
if it was Kong and me.
Right, boy?

13:50.707 --> 13:53.676
They probably ship
their stuff out by air
to avoid the customs.

13:53.743 --> 13:56.109
Looks like a strong
organization which means...

13:56.179 --> 13:59.512
the only way we can
shut it down is to strangle
the entire pipeline.

13:59.582 --> 14:02.244
Yeah, but just not the guys
doing the actual killing.

14:02.318 --> 14:05.845
lt's easy to go out and hire
another bunch of goons
to go out and kill animals.

14:05.922 --> 14:08.220
lt's the shipping
and sales end
of this operation...

14:08.291 --> 14:09.451
we have to shut down.

14:09.526 --> 14:11.187
Well, how are we
gonna do that?

14:11.261 --> 14:13.593
We start with this guy,
Madrid, and work our way
backwards.

14:13.663 --> 14:15.722
lf they are
spotting them by air...

14:15.799 --> 14:19.701
it's very likely that the guy
in the plane is giving
the position of the animals...

14:19.769 --> 14:21.259
to the shooters
on the ground.

14:21.337 --> 14:23.202
That means they're on
a special wavelength.

14:23.273 --> 14:26.902
Yeah. And there can't be
too many places where
they can land and take off.

14:26.976 --> 14:29.171
No. As a matter of fact,
there's only one.

14:29.546 --> 14:30.535
Nice.

14:32.115 --> 14:33.673
[birds chirping]

14:55.205 --> 14:56.194
Hey.

14:59.375 --> 15:00.740
What are you doing in there?

15:00.810 --> 15:03.404
When's the last time
you had the airframe
on this bird checked?

15:03.479 --> 15:05.447
The airframe?
What's that got to do with it?

15:05.515 --> 15:06.982
Working on
my pilot's license.

15:07.050 --> 15:09.518
l like to sit up there
and look at things.

15:09.586 --> 15:12.146
You know
your ashtrays are full
and your carpet's dirty?

15:12.222 --> 15:14.554
My ashtrays?
Yeah, and look over here.

15:14.624 --> 15:17.218
You see? Brake fluid
on that right tire.

15:17.293 --> 15:19.853
Hey, look. l know all
about that.
That's just fine.

15:19.929 --> 15:23.695
What's that got to do
with you crawling around
inside my cockpit, huh?

15:23.766 --> 15:24.858
Well...

15:26.069 --> 15:27.832
no sense
getting excited about that.

15:27.904 --> 15:30.304
Why don't you just gas it up,
huh? So l can get out of here.

15:30.373 --> 15:31.704
Well, it's your funeral.

15:31.774 --> 15:34.402
Look, don't go
sticking your nose
in other people's property...

15:34.477 --> 15:35.944
where it don't belong.

15:37.180 --> 15:39.045
Neatness counts, fellow.

15:39.315 --> 15:40.680
Gas it up.

16:08.211 --> 16:10.611
[plane engine roaring]

16:42.545 --> 16:44.308
Okay, Madrid,
the party's on.

16:44.380 --> 16:46.814
l'm about two miles
above the Zambezi.

16:46.883 --> 16:50.080
Following a herd of elephants,
maybe 12, 15.

16:50.153 --> 16:51.882
It looks like
they've got good tusks.

16:51.988 --> 16:54.320
From where they're going,
it's along the Nandu rift.

16:54.390 --> 16:56.381
Probably heading
for the Undala watering hole.

16:56.459 --> 16:57.858
(Madrid)
Come on, let's go.

16:58.695 --> 17:00.253
The Nandu is right here.

17:00.330 --> 17:03.060
And the watering hole
is two miles north,
right about there.

17:03.533 --> 17:05.558
That's it.
Let's hit it.

17:08.404 --> 17:10.133
Be careful, please. l....

17:11.607 --> 17:14.440
lt just reminds me of
when Kim went after them.

17:14.577 --> 17:16.602
Don't worry,
we'll be all right.

17:19.848 --> 17:21.578
[car engine starting]

17:24.654 --> 17:27.020
(Hannibal)
We'll beat them there
by half an hour.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.024
Keep an eye out
for the airplane.

17:30.526 --> 17:32.892
[trumpeting]

17:39.635 --> 17:43.162
Well, B.A. Baracus,
what does it feel like
now you're here?

17:43.239 --> 17:45.104
You taking it all in?

17:45.742 --> 17:47.039
lt's hard
to imagine that...

17:47.110 --> 17:50.477
centuries ago
your tribesmen
settled right here.

17:50.546 --> 17:52.605
On this ground
upon which we lay.

17:54.050 --> 17:57.042
Look at the dirt.
Go on, look at it.
Look at it, look at it.

17:57.487 --> 17:59.387
The tips of their toes...

17:59.455 --> 18:03.255
curled around each
particle of dirt right here
in the palm of my hand.

18:03.459 --> 18:06.986
The ashes from
their campfires, right here
in the palm of my hand.

18:07.063 --> 18:10.294
The drippings from their
pots and pans, right here
in the palm of my hand.

18:10.366 --> 18:13.824
The leftovers, after
Sunday dinner, right here
in the palm of my hand.

18:13.903 --> 18:16.235
B.A. Baracus,
this is your roots.

18:16.806 --> 18:18.239
This is dirt, fool.

18:18.307 --> 18:20.901
Which l'm gonna
stuff in your face
if you don't shut up.

18:20.977 --> 18:22.638
[elephant trumpeting]

18:23.012 --> 18:24.639
[birds chirping]

18:27.450 --> 18:29.008
What's the matter with him?

18:29.719 --> 18:30.947
Nostalgia.

18:37.794 --> 18:39.261
(Hannibal)
There they are.

18:47.503 --> 18:49.300
They're here.
Can you see them?

18:49.372 --> 18:51.738
Yeah. l got them, Colonel.
About 1 2:00 high.

18:51.808 --> 18:54.709
(Murdock)
There's four of them.
They look pretty mean, too.

18:54.777 --> 18:57.644
Right. You and Face cover us.
We're gonna take them.

19:01.918 --> 19:03.545

19:09.592 --> 19:10.854
[gun firing]

19:30.079 --> 19:31.512
(Hannibal)
Now, step back.

19:32.248 --> 19:33.806
Who in the hell
are you?

19:34.283 --> 19:36.012
Volunteer game wardens.

19:36.085 --> 19:39.179
The game warden that works
this area disappeared
more than a week ago.

19:39.255 --> 19:40.620
We're his replacements.

19:40.690 --> 19:43.659
We figure the last game warden
was murdered by some poachers.

19:43.893 --> 19:45.155
(Hannibal)
You got any idea,

19:45.228 --> 19:46.252
where we might find
some poachers?

19:46.329 --> 19:49.389
The last guy disappeared
'cause he just
wouldn't listen.

19:49.565 --> 19:52.056
But the guy before him retired
a nice rich man.

19:52.135 --> 19:54.330
l'm not retiring
and l'm already rich.

19:54.670 --> 19:56.297
And l'm already mean.

19:56.372 --> 19:58.237
B.A., get their rifles.

20:02.445 --> 20:03.673
Terrific.

20:07.049 --> 20:08.038
[grunting]

20:08.117 --> 20:10.415
You take the one
on the right.
l'll go left.

20:20.429 --> 20:21.418
[grunting]

20:29.839 --> 20:31.306
All right, hold it.

20:35.344 --> 20:37.710
You guys are shut down,
you understand?

20:38.281 --> 20:40.249
l want you to go
back to your boss...

20:40.316 --> 20:41.305
[thudding]

20:41.884 --> 20:45.251
...and tell him,
that the new game wardens
punched your ticket.

20:46.455 --> 20:47.615
Now, don't step...

20:47.690 --> 20:48.679
[thudding]

20:49.358 --> 20:50.347
...foot...

20:51.561 --> 20:52.892
on this preserve again.

20:54.096 --> 20:57.395
Or we'll skin you
and sell your hides.

21:08.377 --> 21:10.208
Well, that was terrific,
Hannibal.

21:10.279 --> 21:11.940
Now they're gonna
want to get even.

21:12.014 --> 21:13.106
l hope so.

21:19.855 --> 21:22.050
(Hannibal)
B.A., we'll stay back
about two miles...

21:22.124 --> 21:23.591
and follow their signal.

21:24.594 --> 21:27.324
(B.A.)
Looks like he's following
the river bed, Hannibal.

21:27.396 --> 21:29.864
(Hannibal)
l can hardly wait to find out
what happens next.

21:30.132 --> 21:32.293
[Murdock imitating bird]

21:34.804 --> 21:36.237
(Novarro)
But there were four of them.

21:36.505 --> 21:37.699
And four of you.

21:37.773 --> 21:42.403
l pay you to bring back tusk
and animal skins.

21:42.478 --> 21:44.036

about game wardens.

These guys had machine guns.
What were we supposed to do?

21:50.653 --> 21:51.950
[snake hissing]

21:52.021 --> 21:53.613
You know what this is?

21:55.057 --> 21:56.046
Eh?

21:57.893 --> 21:59.360
lt's the Mamba.

22:00.863 --> 22:03.491
The deadliest snake
in the whole world.

22:05.701 --> 22:09.467
One bite has enough poison
to kill 30 men.

22:12.408 --> 22:14.808
l have a lot of respect
for this animal.

22:15.444 --> 22:19.403
But if we were
to remove its fangs,
we lose that respect.

22:21.350 --> 22:23.750
Always keep your fangs,
Madrid.

22:24.553 --> 22:26.783
You let these men
push you back.

22:27.189 --> 22:28.417
That's not good.

22:33.362 --> 22:34.522
Now...

22:35.564 --> 22:37.930
we have a shipment
to deliver tomorrow.

22:39.135 --> 22:41.535
l want to deliver
what l promise.

22:49.312 --> 22:52.372

23:10.933 --> 23:13.868
My name's Hannibal Smith.
l heard you wanted to see me.

23:13.936 --> 23:16.928
You are a man with a very
short lifespan, sir.

23:17.073 --> 23:19.667
Well, l got nine lifespans.
Like a cat.

23:20.743 --> 23:22.768
Now, we're only
down here to see you...

23:22.945 --> 23:24.810
because we want
to be sure...

23:24.880 --> 23:28.577
that your, uh, boys over there
gave you the correct message.

23:28.651 --> 23:30.346
They look so irresponsible.

23:30.419 --> 23:34.116
You're not only shut down,
you've got a little debt.
Face?

23:34.190 --> 23:37.785
Right. Yeah,
let's see, that's, uh...

23:37.860 --> 23:42.593
yeah, $472,000.19
for the slaughtered elephants.

23:42.898 --> 23:44.297
lncluding tusks.

23:45.067 --> 23:49.470
Yeah, you can
consider it a contribution,
to the Kenyan Game Preserve.

23:50.106 --> 23:53.542
And we want all the skins
and tusks you've got
stored for shipment.

23:53.609 --> 23:56.476
Hey, l wonder how
your white suit would look
hanging up on a wall.

23:56.545 --> 23:58.638
Or maybe in front
of a fireplace
like a throw rug.

23:58.714 --> 24:00.705
You'll never
get away with this.

24:00.783 --> 24:02.614

who you're dealing with.

24:07.456 --> 24:09.321
we already
got away with it.

who we're dealing with.

poachers.

24:21.937 --> 24:24.497
That's a crummy looking
bookcase you got there.

24:25.007 --> 24:28.238

the money and the skins.

24:28.711 --> 24:30.144
You better listen to him.

as fast as you can.

Airstrip tomorrow morning
is the earliest.

(Madrid)
Yes, we--

25:08.284 --> 25:10.775
(Novarro)
I don't care how you do it,
I want it done.

25:11.754 --> 25:13.517
lt's not coming in too clear,
Hannibal.

25:13.589 --> 25:15.352
Why'd you drop it
in the glass?

25:15.424 --> 25:16.618
l thought
it was waterproof.

25:16.692 --> 25:20.856

but those Mai Tais
are death on transistors.

for that shipment that goes
out tomorrow afternoon.

l follow you, Colonel.

to get some air maps.

25:29.405 --> 25:31.532
We're gonna need you
up there.

25:31.607 --> 25:33.040
He's always up there.

25:33.309 --> 25:36.369
That's true, but--
But this time...

25:37.146 --> 25:38.511
we need you to fly.

25:38.881 --> 25:40.940
Colonel,
when the going gets tough...

25:41.217 --> 25:42.878

get aeronautical. But...

25:44.653 --> 25:46.746
can l take
Kong with me?

No,
but you can have Face.

25:52.862 --> 25:54.295
That's not the same thing.

25:54.363 --> 25:55.523

25:56.298 --> 25:58.766
Now, Face,
l know this prop man in L.A.

25:59.268 --> 26:00.394
We need some stuff,

26:00.469 --> 26:02.869
but it's got to be
on this continent
by tomorrow morning.

26:02.938 --> 26:04.599
Oh, well, no problem.

26:04.707 --> 26:07.232
We need some fake
animal skins,
some plastic elephant tusks,

26:07.309 --> 26:08.571
and it's gonna cost.

26:08.644 --> 26:09.941
Well, why not?

26:10.012 --> 26:13.106
We're already over $3,000
in debt on this job.

26:14.149 --> 26:16.583
Not that that's any problem.

26:16.752 --> 26:17.980

26:18.053 --> 26:19.350
Well, yes.

What's you got
to be afraid of?

Lions, tigers, panthers,
poisonous snakes, rhinos,

to be afraid of.

27:01.964 --> 27:03.192

and keep me company.

don't start--
Get them on and move it.

but 230 pounds of pure fear.

You shouldn't sneak up on me
like that.

l'm sorry.
l thought you heard me.

27:37.466 --> 27:39.331
What are you doing
up this time of night?

27:39.401 --> 27:41.392
Kim used to come
out here at night.

27:42.371 --> 27:44.805
Listen to the sounds
of the world around him.

27:44.873 --> 27:47.535
He used to say they were
peaceful and reassuring.

27:47.610 --> 27:49.874
Personally, they scared me
when l first heard them.

27:49.945 --> 27:51.776
Yeah,
they scare Murdock, too.

and things are happening...

laying there in the dark...

28:04.259 --> 28:07.660
there's nothing to do
but think. Then
it all becomes so real.

28:08.063 --> 28:11.999
His face becomes so clear
and his voice just....

28:13.636 --> 28:15.160
l understand, Kamarra.

28:15.304 --> 28:17.499
Losing someone
you love is hard.

28:17.573 --> 28:20.736
There's nothing
anyone could say or do
that'll make it any easier.

28:20.843 --> 28:24.745
lt's just gonna take time.
That's the only thing
that's gonna make it easier.

28:25.147 --> 28:26.705
Just time.

28:42.498 --> 28:44.466
(Hannibal)
That ought to do just fine.

29:19.601 --> 29:21.501
Get those crates unloaded.

29:27.209 --> 29:28.642
Hey, what's so important,
huh?

29:28.711 --> 29:31.874
[birds chirping]
l get a call at 4:00 to get
down here on the double.

29:31.947 --> 29:33.812
We're still moving
the same stuff, right?

29:33.882 --> 29:35.474
Don't ask
so many questions, Steele.

29:35.551 --> 29:37.416
Just make sure
you get this load through.

29:38.353 --> 29:39.820
lt'll get through.

29:39.922 --> 29:41.116
[door closing]

29:41.690 --> 29:42.714
Okay.

29:42.791 --> 29:45.191
McKaydoo will have the truck
waiting for you when you land.

29:45.260 --> 29:48.752
You sure everything's okay?
You just worry about
getting that plane up.

29:49.131 --> 29:50.758
How's everything going
under there?

29:50.833 --> 29:52.494
Yeah, l got that leak
down to a drip.

29:52.568 --> 29:55.401
You wanna get rid
of that drip, it's gonna
take you another 20 minutes.

29:55.471 --> 29:58.235
You want it fixed right,
put in a new pipe,
take two hours.

29:58.307 --> 29:59.672
Two hours?

29:59.742 --> 30:01.869
l can't wait
around here that long--
Hey...

30:01.944 --> 30:04.242
l don't know who it is
you're worried about.

30:04.313 --> 30:08.113
But l'm not accepting
responsibility for that load
till l'm in the air.

30:08.517 --> 30:09.506
Horton.

30:10.018 --> 30:12.350
You and Lloyd stay with him
until he gets off.

30:12.421 --> 30:14.480
Then you meet us
back at Novarro's.

30:14.857 --> 30:16.825
(Madrid)
Abdul, let's go.

30:37.146 --> 30:40.172
lt's all taken care of.
l put it on your regular bill.

30:42.885 --> 30:44.477
[squeaking]

31:29.932 --> 31:32.162
(Hannibal)
Sorry to ruin your day, pal.

31:45.547 --> 31:47.811
(Steele)
My forward engine
just caught on fire.

31:47.883 --> 31:49.817
I'm gonna put down
on the river road.

31:51.954 --> 31:54.752
(Hannibal)
Face, he's gonna land
on the river road.

32:17.379 --> 32:19.404
[gibbering]

32:19.481 --> 32:21.073
[trumpeting]

32:22.117 --> 32:23.675
[gibbering]

32:46.475 --> 32:47.965
[gibbering]

33:06.595 --> 33:07.960
Hey, what's
going on here?
Well...

33:08.030 --> 33:10.123
just do what we say and
l think you'll figure it out.

33:10.198 --> 33:11.256
Let's move.

33:19.441 --> 33:20.908
Murdock, that was fantastic.

33:20.976 --> 33:23.171
l think you just found
your true calling in life.

33:23.245 --> 33:24.269
Thanks.

33:24.346 --> 33:26.473
Colonel, l'll ride
those babies anytime
you want me to.

33:26.548 --> 33:29.676
But next time, you're gonna
have to get somebody else
to change their oil.

33:29.751 --> 33:32.481
[elephant trumpeting]
Captain, that was nice,
really nice.

33:32.921 --> 33:35.822
Okay, let's get those crates
off the plane and put
our own crates on.

33:35.891 --> 33:37.984
Now, Hannibal, we got a lot
of balls juggling here.

33:38.060 --> 33:40.688
l just hope your, uh, plan
comes together.

33:40.762 --> 33:42.354
Have a little faith,
Lieutenant.

33:42.431 --> 33:44.296
Bring him along.
He can carry crates, too.

33:44.366 --> 33:46.391
(Hannibal)
B.A., let's get
this oil line fixed.

33:46.468 --> 33:48.493
lsn't that nice?
You get to carry crates, too.

34:56.271 --> 34:57.761
This is crazy, you know.

34:57.839 --> 35:01.240
l got a truck waiting for me.
How're you gonna get away
with this?

35:01.443 --> 35:04.708
Watch. Life is full
of wonderful surprises.

35:04.780 --> 35:05.838
When we land...

35:05.914 --> 35:10.214
you just look out the window,
smile and let them unload
the crates. You got that?

35:10.652 --> 35:15.021
And to help remind you,
l'll, uh, l'll have this .357
stuck in your guts.

35:43.752 --> 35:47.051
All right, keep the engines
running and tell them
to unload the crates.

35:48.790 --> 35:51.816
You're late.
l had some
mechanical problems.

35:51.893 --> 35:54.418
Look, uh, l got one more stop.

35:54.496 --> 35:56.430
So get those crates
unloaded, right?

35:57.432 --> 35:58.626
[plane engine running]

35:58.700 --> 36:01.726
Very good.
l even believed you.

36:03.305 --> 36:04.294
[Face exclaiming]

36:06.708 --> 36:07.732
Got you.

36:12.714 --> 36:15.046
You can take off now,
you're unloaded.

36:16.051 --> 36:17.848
Okay. Thanks a lot.

36:18.086 --> 36:19.576
See you around.

36:29.965 --> 36:31.296
They gonna buy that?

36:31.366 --> 36:32.890
Of course,
they're gonna buy that.

36:32.968 --> 36:34.902
Let's get out of here.
We're moving.

36:34.970 --> 36:35.959
[plane engine roaring loudly]

36:51.386 --> 36:53.718
l don't believe that.
You believe that?

36:53.788 --> 36:55.415
You believe
those guys bought that?

36:55.490 --> 36:57.481
Look, you can fool
some of the people
all the time...

36:57.559 --> 36:59.288
and all of the people
some of the time.

36:59.361 --> 37:02.228
But that sucker back there,
we could have fooled
every time.

37:02.297 --> 37:05.289
Yeah, they don't
make the bad guys like
they used to, do they?

37:14.342 --> 37:15.400
(Face)
Yeah, there they are.

37:15.477 --> 37:17.877
They're going about, oh,
about 50 miles an hour.

37:18.346 --> 37:21.406
Well, l can keep
this baby at about 70,
minimum air speed.

37:21.483 --> 37:24.680
Do a few 360s, uh, loop turns
and stay with them.

37:25.253 --> 37:27.448
Could you do it
without the loops?
Uh-uh.

37:34.296 --> 37:36.787
Hey, hey.
Take it easy
with them crates.

37:36.865 --> 37:38.423
l got ivory tusks
in there.

37:40.402 --> 37:43.701
That's everything
off the truck.
Well, it's about time.

37:43.805 --> 37:47.332
l mean, l only got customers
from all over Europe
yelling at me for these...

37:47.409 --> 37:49.536
furs around here. Hey.

37:49.611 --> 37:51.670
Get a wire off to Germany
and tell them we're...

37:51.746 --> 37:54.078
gonna have them furs
out of here right away.

37:54.516 --> 37:56.450
Freeze.
Freeze. Right.

37:56.518 --> 37:58.042
All right, over there.
Over there.

37:58.119 --> 37:59.211
What is this?

37:59.454 --> 38:00.785
You got a warrant?
Uh-huh.

38:00.855 --> 38:02.482
What's with you guys?

38:02.557 --> 38:05.082
We take care of you. We're
not supposed to be raided.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.559
We make our paydays.

38:06.628 --> 38:08.289
Payday?
Payday? What's payday?

38:08.363 --> 38:09.523
Yeah, wouldn't know
about that.

38:09.598 --> 38:10.530
No.
No.

38:10.599 --> 38:14.296
No, the warrant here
says illegal animal hides
and elephant tusks...

38:14.369 --> 38:15.461
you see, so...

38:15.537 --> 38:18.028
l'm terribly afraid
if we find any
of those here...

38:18.106 --> 38:19.573
we're going
to have to take you in.

38:19.641 --> 38:20.903
Yes.

38:20.976 --> 38:22.409
Open those crates.
Yes, open them.

38:22.477 --> 38:23.501
Open them.

38:23.578 --> 38:24.943
(Face)
Do as he says.

38:26.648 --> 38:29.014
Now, stand back.
Stand back.

38:29.084 --> 38:30.278
(Face)
There you go.

38:30.819 --> 38:32.343
This is disgusting.

38:32.420 --> 38:33.580
Yes.

38:33.822 --> 38:35.517
l suppose you're unaware
of the fact...

38:35.590 --> 38:38.718
that you're prohibited
from taking elephant tusks
and selling them, right?

38:38.793 --> 38:41.455
Of course.
You are a disease.

38:41.830 --> 38:45.322
You are infection and l only
wish a court of law recognized
the antidote.

38:45.800 --> 38:48.268
We can, uh, we can
explain all this.

38:48.336 --> 38:50.531
Gibbons, feel this.

38:52.674 --> 38:53.663
Mmm.

38:53.808 --> 38:57.369
lt's plastic.
Exactly. Mmm.

38:59.314 --> 39:01.714
Templeton, feel this.

39:03.151 --> 39:04.778
lt's nylon?
Nylon.

39:04.919 --> 39:05.943
(Face)
Oh-oh.

39:06.021 --> 39:08.854
We've made a terrible mistake.
Terrible mistake.
Terribly sorry.

39:08.923 --> 39:12.359
Well, of course, it's, uh,
nylon. We'd never deal in...

39:12.427 --> 39:14.019
in real animal hides.

39:14.562 --> 39:16.223
Well, l don't quite know
what to say.

39:16.298 --> 39:18.061
We've been rude.
Yes, very rude.

39:18.133 --> 39:19.691
Terribly rude.
Yes.

39:19.768 --> 39:22.396
Was this your idea?
No, it must have come
from the front office.

39:22.470 --> 39:24.665
The front office.
Yes, yes,
you're obviously legitimate.

39:24.739 --> 39:27.207
There's no law against selling
plastic and nylon, is there?

39:27.275 --> 39:28.674
Plastic and nylon
are all right.
No.

39:28.743 --> 39:30.210
Animal hides
and elephant tusks--

39:30.278 --> 39:31.711
Are what we're looking for.

39:31.780 --> 39:33.907
Yes. So, carry on.
(Murdock)
Terribly sorry.

39:33.982 --> 39:35.006
Carry on.

39:35.083 --> 39:37.916
Plastic and nylon
are all right.
So sorry.

39:38.953 --> 39:40.215
What did he mean
by payday?

39:40.288 --> 39:41.312
Don't know.

39:47.529 --> 39:49.292
Novarro's pulling
a scam on me.

39:50.532 --> 39:52.124
Sending me fakes!

39:54.302 --> 39:57.465
Well, he's a dead man.
Get the jeep.

40:01.743 --> 40:04.143
You're a dead man,
Mr. Novarro.

40:06.114 --> 40:08.139
You were right.
McKaydoo took the bait.

40:08.550 --> 40:10.780
He's headed
for Novarro's place.
Beautiful.

40:11.586 --> 40:14.111
McKaydoo'll go after Novarro.
With a little bit of luck...

40:14.189 --> 40:15.918
shut down his end
of the operation.

40:15.990 --> 40:17.116
Well, l sure hope so.

40:17.192 --> 40:18.955
l'll meet you back here.

40:20.829 --> 40:22.524
The only loose end
is Madrid.

40:22.597 --> 40:23.928
[gun firing]

40:23.998 --> 40:25.590
Madrid?
Better check it out.

40:27.869 --> 40:29.166

[Kong grunting]

40:53.728 --> 40:55.992
Now, let's get out of here.
l'm gonna shut
that monkey up.

40:56.064 --> 40:57.122
No. Kong, run.

l mean, l thought that--

41:55.356 --> 41:56.345
[whimpering]

41:56.424 --> 41:58.483
What's the matter?
Where is everybody?

42:02.530 --> 42:03.792
They got Kamarra.

42:07.101 --> 42:10.628
Base to Rover Two.
Base to Rover Two.
Do you read?

42:10.905 --> 42:12.736
B.A., are you out there?

42:12.974 --> 42:14.566
Yeah, Faceman, l read you.

42:14.642 --> 42:17.634
Where are you guys?
We were tracking
Madrid's jeep.

42:17.712 --> 42:20.772
We're about two miles
south of Novarro's place.
They stopped up ahead.

42:20.849 --> 42:23.374
So Hannibal went
to check it out.
All right, we're on our way.

42:23.451 --> 42:25.043
Okay. Hurry up, man.

42:29.057 --> 42:30.524
They're in a warehouse.

42:30.859 --> 42:34.295
lt's probably where Novarro
holds his stuff before
he ships it to McKaydoo.

42:34.362 --> 42:36.660
Face just called.
Him and Murdock
is on the way.

42:36.731 --> 42:38.699
Good. We'll hit them
as soon as they get here.

42:38.766 --> 42:41.257
(Novarro)
l swear to you, McKaydoo.
This is a mistake.

42:41.336 --> 42:43.463
lf l get so much as
one little complaint...

42:43.538 --> 42:46.234
from all the orders l shipped
out of here last week,
and l'll get you.

42:46.307 --> 42:49.071
l swear to you,
all those goods
were 100 percent.

42:49.143 --> 42:52.977
This is where l store it all.
l'm empty because l shipped
them out to you.

42:53.248 --> 42:56.012
lt was just that last order
that was intercepted.

42:56.084 --> 42:57.312
And as l was telling you--

42:57.385 --> 43:00.115
lt scares me, Novarro.
lt scares the hoot out of me.

43:00.188 --> 43:02.679
That you let this little girl
give you this much trouble.

[Kong gibbering]

46:29.130 --> 46:31.928
Kamarra, you gotta
call your boss and tell him
to bring a truck.

46:31.999 --> 46:35.332
Tell him we've got
a bunch of renegade
baboons to bring in.

When souls have touched,
friends are never apart.

46:50.151 --> 46:52.676
l'll never forget what
you guys did here today.

46:54.021 --> 46:55.648
Well, that's nothing.

46:56.457 --> 46:59.017
But unfortunately there will
always be bad people...

46:59.093 --> 47:01.960
who will try to destroy
the wildlife of your country
for profit.

47:03.598 --> 47:06.829
At least we got Novarro,
McKaydoo, and Madrid.

47:07.068 --> 47:08.126
lt's a start.

47:08.202 --> 47:10.693
Uh, yeah, speaking
of starts,
it's time we got started.

47:10.772 --> 47:12.763
The plane leaves
in less than an hour.

47:12.874 --> 47:14.432
Right. Goodbye.
