WEBVTT

00:21.488 --> 00:24.658
I was born to slay this beast! Power!

00:27.394 --> 00:31.899
I'm so proud that I served my country.
And I'll win this game.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.111
<i>I can set an example for my sons.</i>

00:44.178 --> 00:46.246
I want to do it in my father's name.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.785
<i>That's right, exactly. I'm short...</i>

00:51.852 --> 00:53.153
...but I'll be the champion.

00:56.456 --> 00:57.691
Power!

01:06.567 --> 01:08.368
-Brazil!
-Mexico!

01:22.416 --> 01:24.685
Careful, Muscle Samurai!

02:19.406 --> 02:22.075
Come on! Yes!

02:22.142 --> 02:24.678
I'm very excited. It's a giant video game!

02:24.745 --> 02:27.648
-I'm in Super Mario Brothers!
-It's very cool, right?

02:27.714 --> 02:31.351
-It's Super Mario Brothers.
-It's Super Hyper Ultra Mario Brothers.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.740
<i>My name is Shoji Nakayama.</i>

02:53.807 --> 02:56.343
I'm 37, from Fukuoka Prefecture.

02:57.744 --> 03:01.848
<i>The Japanese revere samurai as heroes.</i>

03:01.915 --> 03:06.053
<i>I add "muscle" to that,</i>
<i>calling myself Muscle Samurai.</i>

03:09.089 --> 03:12.092
<i>As a participant representing Japan,</i>

03:12.159 --> 03:15.896
<i>I'm hoping to bring Muscle Samurai</i>
<i>into the global limelight.</i>

03:18.932 --> 03:22.269
At the end of this <i>Ultimate Beastmaster,</i>

03:22.769 --> 03:25.439
<i>surely only I shall remain.</i>

03:26.606 --> 03:27.474
Power!

04:52.192 --> 04:53.894
-Can he hold on?
-There, he's got it!

04:53.960 --> 04:55.862
-Looking strong!
-Come on, Muscle Sam!

05:11.778 --> 05:13.614
He's going for the Thruster...

05:14.748 --> 05:17.484
Oh no! What happened? He couldn't make it!

05:21.154 --> 05:23.423
-He lost his wig!
-Oh, he lost his wig!

05:23.490 --> 05:25.158
What is happening?

05:42.576 --> 05:48.582
For a samurai, losing this hair
amounts to ritual suicide.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.319
It is a samurai's life.

07:35.188 --> 07:40.026
I served in Special Forces
for four years, safe and sound.

07:40.093 --> 07:45.332
<i>I've learned a lot. And I'll do my best.</i>

07:45.398 --> 07:47.100
No regrets. Go, Korea!

08:10.224 --> 08:11.491
-Yeah!
-He made it!

08:18.832 --> 08:20.234
Yeah! Go, Mexico!

08:41.455 --> 08:43.457
Ah! But now he's fallen!

09:44.884 --> 09:48.655
He did it! The Brazilian did it.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.557
Very good.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.199
Go...

11:22.349 --> 11:25.853
I wanted to take everything I could.
I'll get everything.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.788
I want all the points.

13:08.388 --> 13:12.159
Anderson, now that the Brazilian is ahead,
do you hope the American falls in?

13:12.226 --> 13:15.295
-No, I'm not hoping the American...
-You are kidding, right? I am.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.397
I'm not hoping the American falls
in the water, no.

13:23.871 --> 13:27.074
The Olympic swimmer Ed Moses fell off.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.544
Now he's going to use his swimming
techniques in the Beast's blood.

13:30.611 --> 13:31.812
Exactly.

14:07.914 --> 14:12.218
<i>I grew up in a slum. We were very poor,</i>

14:12.285 --> 14:13.953
<i>and it was a difficult childhood.</i>

14:14.020 --> 14:17.990
<i>Capoeira gave me an opportunity</i>
<i>to believe in myself.</i>

14:18.058 --> 14:20.928
<i>I am one of the best athletes</i>
<i>for this competition.</i>

14:31.104 --> 14:33.306
She fell off!

15:06.039 --> 15:07.307
What is this?

15:26.627 --> 15:29.196
She made it there, but slipped right over!

15:29.262 --> 15:32.465
-She got too far up there! Exactly.
-She slipped.

15:32.532 --> 15:35.435
I'll tell you one thing,
her feet got further than she expected.

15:35.501 --> 15:36.469
That was a good jump!

16:06.800 --> 16:10.637
<i>My father left us when I was 12.</i>

16:10.704 --> 16:13.807
I was very upset and started eating a lot

16:13.873 --> 16:16.609
<i>and became quite chubby.</i>

16:18.445 --> 16:21.048
<i>One day, I realized I had to change</i>
<i>something in my life</i>

16:21.114 --> 16:24.518
and should not give up

16:24.585 --> 16:26.053
<i>but go my own way.</i>

16:26.119 --> 16:28.255
<i>I am the Ultimate Beastmaster.</i>

16:43.136 --> 16:47.574
Germany!

17:05.858 --> 17:08.227
Directly into the Energy Coils.

17:27.648 --> 17:28.649
Yes.

18:41.889 --> 18:45.325
And now he is slipping.

18:45.392 --> 18:48.462
He slipped.
He didn't know where to go next.

19:05.946 --> 19:10.551
I really wanted to complete this,
but it will still work. I think I'm okay.

19:57.397 --> 20:02.035
I saw that it's difficult, requires a lot
of concentration, a lot of precision.

20:08.008 --> 20:10.511
It is a samurai's life.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.413
<i>I'll give the second stage my all.</i>

20:13.480 --> 20:14.648
Power!

20:21.855 --> 20:27.194
I want to show my mother with this
how important she is to me,

20:27.259 --> 20:33.265
but I also want to show my father
what became of me.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.057
This is going to be hard. Abort!

21:04.730 --> 21:06.732
Almost in the blood!

22:21.473 --> 22:27.947
Thanks to my calisthenics
and free athletics workouts,

22:28.013 --> 22:30.683
I am used to moving
my own body weight very fast

22:30.751 --> 22:33.820
over different obstacles.

23:12.860 --> 23:16.029
And now a controlled jump
onto the Dreadmill.

23:19.233 --> 23:23.136
No, that was not a good jump.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.676
I should have run up the tube faster,
then I might have made it.

23:31.378 --> 23:34.681
I hit the Point Thruster,

23:35.014 --> 23:36.715
but I should have made it further.

23:47.793 --> 23:51.497
The thing I'm most proud of doing?
Having my son.

23:52.266 --> 23:55.669
<i>"A father is strong."</i>

23:55.736 --> 23:59.306
<i>I wanted to show everybody</i>
<i>how to break yourself out of the shell.</i>

24:20.893 --> 24:24.330
My son, you didn't see that, okay?

24:36.610 --> 24:41.982
-All of Mexico's guts there!
-Yeah, he made it! Yeah!

24:53.158 --> 24:55.594
I had to make it. There was no other way.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.863
<i>I had to do it out of pure pride!</i>

25:22.990 --> 25:24.825
-Whoa there!
-Careful, Muscle Samurai!

25:24.892 --> 25:26.193
Careful, Muscle Samurai!

25:37.803 --> 25:40.739
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>my landing just didn't go well.</i>

25:41.206 --> 25:44.510
At least I was able to save my topknot.

26:44.304 --> 26:47.074
He is spinning as if he had drunk

26:47.140 --> 26:48.775
a lot of bottles of whiskey.

27:22.809 --> 27:25.179
Anderson, now is the time.

27:25.245 --> 27:27.548
Now is the time
to separate children from adults.

27:35.088 --> 27:37.925
Very well. Can I speak? Very well.

27:37.990 --> 27:42.794
Don't be sad. It means that the Brazilian
has a chance to continue leading.

28:33.780 --> 28:34.982
Let's go, Johannes!

28:36.648 --> 28:38.116
Go for it, bro.

28:53.901 --> 28:58.505
-Look at his face, Anderson.
-He's focused. His dad is German.

28:58.572 --> 29:02.342
-But he is Brazilian.
-Take a look.

29:47.753 --> 29:52.257
He managed to jump! Very well!
That's great!

30:01.034 --> 30:05.105
Holy crap, man.
Unfortunately, Johannes fell, guys.

30:05.172 --> 30:07.741
-What did he do? I don't get it.
-Oh, boy...

30:14.112 --> 30:19.518
I'm happy to take Brazil ahead.
Again, the leadership is mine.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.587
The American is going to have trouble
taking it from me.

30:22.656 --> 30:24.057
He won't be able to.

30:34.134 --> 30:35.435
Come on, Angie!

30:35.502 --> 30:39.139
All of Mexico's with you, girl!

30:39.206 --> 30:40.340
-Mexico!
-Mexico!

31:40.701 --> 31:43.537
-Look at Angie, my girl!
-That's another 20 points!

32:13.934 --> 32:16.770
-Ay, my girl!
-No!

32:24.311 --> 32:28.148
I lacked on that jump, I think,
and I couldn't grab it hard.

32:28.215 --> 32:30.851
But if this is God's will...

33:19.364 --> 33:24.402
I am confident. As I was first on Level 1

33:24.471 --> 33:27.040
and first on Level 2,

33:27.107 --> 33:29.109
I hope it's the same now at Level 3.

33:48.762 --> 33:52.065
I think the important thing
for you is the start.

33:52.132 --> 33:54.101
Imagine both of us in the final.

33:54.168 --> 33:55.903
Let's show them what Koreans are.

33:55.967 --> 33:57.469
Cheer for each other.

34:02.843 --> 34:07.614
I am about to make it.

34:07.681 --> 34:11.385
I want to take this thing home to Germany,
as you can see.

34:11.451 --> 34:13.787
I would hate to fail
just before the finish line.

34:33.674 --> 34:37.277
He is holding on! Yes, David!

35:01.001 --> 35:04.204
-I'm thinking he is not going to make it.
-Me too.

35:08.141 --> 35:10.143
He did it! Wow, he shut my mouth up.

35:10.210 --> 35:12.846
I'll never talk about a German again.

35:12.913 --> 35:15.916
-Me neither!
-Those Germans just shut my mouth up.

36:25.786 --> 36:27.821
-It is a matter of centimeters.
-Lie down, man.

36:27.888 --> 36:29.256
And he is falling!

36:29.323 --> 36:30.624
He couldn't hold it!

37:39.593 --> 37:42.696
-And he is falling!
-He fell!

37:42.763 --> 37:45.966
He had the rope in his hand,

37:46.264 --> 37:49.667
but he could not hold on!

38:02.781 --> 38:04.649
Here comes Jinbong Lee!

38:04.716 --> 38:07.986
-Go, Korea!
-Go, Korea!

38:08.055 --> 38:09.857
Jinbong!

38:19.898 --> 38:22.433
-Yes, a good start.
-Very good.

38:22.503 --> 38:25.239
-And now...
-Grab it!

38:42.756 --> 38:44.124
It's harder...

38:46.260 --> 38:47.427
...than it looks.

38:54.234 --> 38:57.337
Lee Koohun, here he comes...

38:57.404 --> 39:00.140
<i>It's good to be Top 5.</i>

39:00.205 --> 39:05.276
I want to see what I can do on Level 3.

39:16.456 --> 39:17.958
And now...

39:18.025 --> 39:19.526
-Very good.
-Koohun Lee.

39:32.940 --> 39:34.908
You shouldn't wait for the jump point.

42:04.989 --> 42:07.091
This motivates me
to have a great performance.

42:07.158 --> 42:10.328
If I am here,
I will take this title to Brazil.

42:10.397 --> 42:11.798
I need to take it to Brazil.

42:16.734 --> 42:19.370
Ladies and gentlemen,
now for our Brazilian!

42:19.437 --> 42:21.339
Brazil!

42:24.044 --> 42:25.712
We are a bit goofy,

42:25.777 --> 42:28.446
but that's
because we are rooting for our Johannes,

42:28.513 --> 42:30.581
who has qualified in the first position.

42:30.651 --> 42:35.522
And folks, he needs to get
to the Prism Strike ropes.

42:35.589 --> 42:37.391
The last of the Mohicans.

42:37.457 --> 42:39.760
Okay, Anderson. I'm turning around.
I can't watch.

42:39.826 --> 42:42.462
-Oh, man...
-I'm not watching. I'm going to hide.

42:42.529 --> 42:44.598
I can't watch, either. I'm going with you.

42:44.662 --> 42:46.030
Let's see how they react.

43:02.850 --> 43:05.485
-Let's go, Johannes.
-Look at him, man.

43:05.552 --> 43:07.888
-Let's go, Johannes, for God's sake.
-He left!

43:07.955 --> 43:09.723
-Easy, easy, easy.
-Let's go!

43:18.599 --> 43:20.367
I can't believe it!

43:49.563 --> 43:52.232
I slipped in the end.

43:53.064 --> 43:56.033
I slipped, lost my balance
at the time of the jump.

43:56.901 --> 44:00.004
That sucks.

45:00.064 --> 45:03.434
-Let's go!
-Let's go, Germany!

46:32.292 --> 46:34.261
Come on, David! Pull yourself up!

46:34.328 --> 46:35.729
Let's go, David!

46:37.431 --> 46:39.967
<i>Yeah, David! Pull yourself up.</i>

46:57.851 --> 46:59.620
Come on, David!

46:59.684 --> 47:02.420
He will get the next points.

47:35.255 --> 47:37.457
Eight, seven, six...

47:47.701 --> 47:54.141
David Manthei won $10,000!

47:54.208 --> 47:55.209
<i>David!</i>

48:15.863 --> 48:18.432
I won. Unbelievable!

48:18.498 --> 48:20.167
I am so happy!

48:20.234 --> 48:24.505
Germany!

48:24.571 --> 48:28.175
It is as if my heart was beating
in my fingertips.

48:28.275 --> 48:32.913
I am Beastmaster,
and want to become Ultimate Beastmaster.
