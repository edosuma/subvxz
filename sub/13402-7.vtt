00:06.400 --> 00:09.267
- 'They had a funeral for her.‘
- I'll delete the call.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.532
When Toby and I broke up

00:10.540 --> 00:12.132

You should know better
than to take my mom is things.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.408
I'd like you to explain
a few things.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.115
Maybe there's something in here
that can help you

00:21.120 --> 00:22.712
find a connection
between Mary and Elliot.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.314
Look into him, please. See
if you can find out anything.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.742
- Are you okay?
- I will be.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.354
You should tell Caleb
that you and Jordan broke up.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.123
She was looking
at your computer.

00:31.130 --> 00:32.882
- Really?
- Elliott Rollins is a fraud.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.926
Somehow, you knew his real
identity before anyone else.

00:35.930 --> 00:37.227
Will you marry me?

00:38.130 --> 00:39.620

00:48.540 --> 00:50.599

- I'm not afraid of Jenna.

00:50.610 --> 00:52.771
- I'm not talking about Jenna.

01:01.690 --> 01:03.317
What are these?

01:03.330 --> 01:04.479
Well, by no means

01:04.490 --> 01:06.754
can they top
that rock on your finger.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.021
But..

01:10.030 --> 01:11.861
...after what happened to Ali

01:11.870 --> 01:13.292
'I started thinking..'

01:14.640 --> 01:18.064
...that we're like this crazy,
dysfunctional family.

01:18.070 --> 01:21.471
But we work together.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.971
And I've just decided
that I'm at a point in my life

01:23.980 --> 01:25.345
where I'm wanna put the people

01:25.350 --> 01:27.568
who've had my back
before anything else.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.087
I'm right there with you.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.415

and to our friendship.

01:40.430 --> 01:43.558
To Aria. Congratulations.

01:43.570 --> 01:46.323
- And I better be a bridesmaid.
- You kidding me?

Ali, what is it?

02:02.520 --> 02:05.444
"Roses are red,
violets are blue

02:05.450 --> 02:07.748
you killed Elliott,
and I could have killed you."

02:10.260 --> 02:11.852
A.D. knows that we killed him.

[indistinct chattering]

02:54.700 --> 02:57.134
It's Sara Harvey.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.402
She's dead.

03:03.610 --> 03:06.078
Got a secret_
can you keep It?

03:06.080 --> 03:08.674
Swear this one you'll save

03:08.680 --> 03:11.069
Better lock it
in your pocket

03:11.090 --> 03:13.615
Taking this one to the grave

03:13.620 --> 03:16.009
If I show you
then I know

03:16.030 --> 03:18.681
You won't tell what I said

03:18.690 --> 03:21.124
'Cause two can keep a secret

Look at that. Pretending
to be Sara's best friend.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.609
Didn't they just meet?

in the shower and hit her head.‘

Em, are you okay?

04:10.010 --> 04:12.001
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:12.010 --> 04:14.979
Sara said that Jenna wasn't
the one we should be afraid of.

04:16.150 --> 04:17.640
I also saw a file on her desktop

04:17.650 --> 04:19.515
labelled
"Charlotte DiLaurentis."

04:20.820 --> 04:22.788
Well, something in there
could link up to AD.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.887
We need to steal that laptop.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.226
Well, if you do
want to talk about Sara

04:32.230 --> 04:33.265
I'm here for you.

04:33.270 --> 04:35.534
Thanks, I just
can't right now.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.766
You know, we really
should be doing intervals.

Boosts the heart rate
and metabolism.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.500
I'm out in nature,
and I'm jogging.

04:42.510 --> 04:45.502
Em, give your mom
a little credit.

04:45.510 --> 04:47.569
So what do you wanna do
for your birthday?

04:47.580 --> 04:49.070
- Em, we already about this.
- Well, I know.

I was just, I was thinking,
you know I'm working--

04:50.890 --> 04:53.518
No, Em , that's okay.
That's fine, really.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.818
I-I-I,
I don't wanna do anything.

04:55.820 --> 04:59.449
I mean, let's just treat this
like every other day, okay?

04:59.460 --> 05:02.952
Where I have to jog to erase
the eclair I ate last night.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.198
Okay, well, I was just gonna say

05:04.200 --> 05:05.622
you could come by
after my shift.

05:05.630 --> 05:07.166
I could buy you dinner.

05:07.170 --> 05:09.297
Look, it's just a meal.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.766
[sighs]
Alright.

05:10.770 --> 05:13.261
Alright, just promise me
you'll keep it low key.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.032
Might as well go in our sweats.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.600
I'm gonna have to go on my
sweats, 'cause after this jog

05:17.610 --> 05:19.202
I'm not gonna be able to move.

05:19.210 --> 05:20.677
Well, I'll race you to the car.

05:20.680 --> 05:21.772
Oh, hey!

05:21.780 --> 05:23.008
[laughing]

05:43.040 --> 05:45.008
So..

05:45.010 --> 05:46.568
So..

05:46.580 --> 05:48.639
She told us
that she came back to town

05:48.640 --> 05:50.232
for your engagement dinner.

05:50.250 --> 05:53.276
You really think I would invite
Jenna to my engagement dinner?

05:53.280 --> 05:54.838
So what is she doing
back here?

05:54.850 --> 05:56.511
You know what,
that's always one of the things

05:56.520 --> 05:59.318
I loved about you.
Your tenacity, your..

05:59.320 --> 06:01.584
Abrasiveness?

06:01.590 --> 06:03.080
What is she doing here, Toby?

06:06.260 --> 06:08.626
She was looking for forgiveness.

06:14.670 --> 06:17.195
That one cracked in the middle.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.859
Those are my favorite.

06:23.110 --> 06:25.249
You know, it took a lot
for my dad to convince me

06:25.250 --> 06:26.501
to come on this trip.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.078
- I get it. I just--
- No, wait. J-Just wait.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.072
Let me, let me get this off.

06:31.090 --> 06:32.409
I'm glad that I came.

06:33.890 --> 06:36.313
You know, maybe this could be
the start of a new tradition.

06:36.330 --> 06:37.888
Hmm.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.030
You okay?

06:52.710 --> 06:54.029
Toby.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.701
Yeah?

06:58.180 --> 06:59.772
I'm afraid.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.443
There are some things that..

07:04.490 --> 07:08.153
_ ...I can't see
In my mind anymore.

07:10.660 --> 07:12.924
They're slipping away.

07:15.730 --> 07:16.924
Like you.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.458
And your face.

07:22.140 --> 07:23.664
Here.

07:30.980 --> 07:32.208
Here.

07:46.830 --> 07:48.650
I can see you.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.927
Jenna.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.259
I-I-I thought you--

07:54.270 --> 07:55.794
You thought wrong.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.232
Jenna let? that night.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.702
I haven't seen her since.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.076
Not-not until she came back
to town recently.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.910
I'm so sorry, Toby.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.212
Why didn't you ever tell me?

08:16.260 --> 08:17.386
We were broken up.

08:17.390 --> 08:19.187
I wasn't gonna
bother you in DC.

this morning in a panic.

I had a dream
he was coming for us.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.488
And that feeling, it..

08:48.490 --> 08:50.913
...stayed with me
through breakfast.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.819
But then I realized you're here.

When did you get in? I thought
your plane landed at five.

09:09.010 --> 09:12.173
Oh. I caught an earlier one.
I couldn't wait to see you.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.841
Look at this.

and some Warby Parkers

- Yes.

as Ali's primary caretaker.

You haven't even met
the woman yet.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.558
Well, that woman is the reason

10:01.560 --> 10:03.653
you were
institutionalized, Ali.

10:03.670 --> 10:04.967
She locked you away
like Charlotte

10:04.970 --> 10:06.460
so she could take our money.

10:06.470 --> 10:08.859
She was working with Elliott.
And he was the one

10:08.870 --> 10:10.235
that sucked her in,
just like he did with me.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.003
How could you get married
without telling me?

10:12.010 --> 10:13.830
Because you weren't here!

in a long time.

Jason, I'm not saying
that she's a saint.

10:25.050 --> 10:27.689
But when she realized
how far Elliott was taking it

10:27.690 --> 10:29.055
she got me out of Welby.

10:29.060 --> 10:30.982
Because it was
the right thing to do.

10:34.530 --> 10:36.623
I have no one.

10:36.630 --> 10:39.190
Not dad, not you.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.737
You're here now, but I never
know how long you'll stay.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.738
So please give her a chance.

She's our aunt.

get to know her?

stay here at the hospital.

Just get here when you can.

11:40.630 --> 11:42.450
Are you okay?

11:42.460 --> 11:44.121
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm good.

11:44.130 --> 11:47.293
Just, uh, just having a little
trouble breathing. That's all.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.995
But I'm great.

You know, we don't have to use
all these decorations.

Maybe. .

12:09.420 --> 12:10.648
Okay, that-that sounded lame.

But, no,
I'm not talking of like

12:11.960 --> 12:15.452
all of this wedding chapel,
I'm thinking villa

12:15.460 --> 12:17.553
in Tuscany.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.027
- Are you serious?
- Yes, yes.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.838
Family friend, Geo,
he owns this villa in Barca.

12:22.840 --> 12:26.332
It's on this hill.
It overlooks a vineyard. It's--

12:26.340 --> 12:28.672
You are serious?

12:28.680 --> 12:30.898
Will you
at least think about it?

12:37.990 --> 12:40.288
[instrumental music]

13:20.200 --> 13:22.088
Oh, my God, Caleb!
What are you doing here?

13:22.100 --> 13:24.489
Sorry, I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.219
Your mom hired me
to beef up the hotel security.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.390
I saw you come in.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.594
Look"

13:30.610 --> 13:33.261
I don't think what happened
to Sara was an accident.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.759
And I'm betting
you don't either.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.475
Em saw something
on Jenna's laptop

13:36.480 --> 13:38.038
that can link back to AD.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.972
It might explain
what happened to Sara.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.940
I know a way we can get
the key to the lock box

13:42.950 --> 13:45.043
but I'm gonna need your help.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.056
(Aria)
'Are we actually
considering this?‘

13:50.060 --> 13:53.052
You think we can seriously
pull off an elopement?

13:53.060 --> 13:55.528
Aria, Sara Harvey
was found dead at The Radley.

13:55.530 --> 13:59.261
Let's just go
and get out of this town.

13:59.270 --> 14:02.364
Don't you think skipping town
might seem a little suspicious?

14:02.370 --> 14:04.998
Well, s-suspicious to you?
You didn't kill Sara.

14:06.110 --> 14:07.907
Did you?

14:08.280 --> 14:09.599
Aria

14:09.610 --> 14:11.237
we could be wine-tasting

14:11.250 --> 14:12.842
under the Tuscan sun by Friday.

14:12.850 --> 14:16.274
I love the idea, I do, but..

14:16.280 --> 14:18.077
[sighs]

14:18.090 --> 14:20.081
It's a really big decision.

14:20.090 --> 14:22.979
Yeah, today's rushing it.

14:24.690 --> 14:26.282
Tomorrow?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.627
[chuckles]

14:30.300 --> 14:31.858
[phone ringing]

14:38.840 --> 14:42.105
No escape hold on tight

14:42.110 --> 14:46.001
Make no mistake
you know you're right

14:46.010 --> 14:50.117
Not gonna claim
that you can't explain

14:50.120 --> 14:53.044
You're hurting faking
but know your pain

14:53.050 --> 14:54.915
Shut up

14:55.590 --> 14:56.614
Hi, Emily.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.521
I always knew
you'd never get out of Rosewood.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.223
Know your pain shut up

15:08.670 --> 15:09.967
(Aria)
'Wow.'

15:09.970 --> 15:12.609
Traveling really brought out
the rugged in you.

15:12.610 --> 15:14.202
[chuckles]

15:14.210 --> 15:16.701
And you kept the beard.

15:16.710 --> 15:18.007
You look great.

15:22.550 --> 15:25.212
I'm engaged.

15:25.220 --> 15:26.244
To Liam?

15:29.360 --> 15:30.679
To Ezra.

15:32.930 --> 15:33.988
[sighs]

15:34.000 --> 15:35.353
Congratulations.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.492
- Thank you.
- He's a very lucky guy.

15:44.840 --> 15:48.207
You haven't told anyone..

15:48.210 --> 15:50.531
...about us, have you?

15:50.550 --> 15:51.630
No.

15:51.650 --> 15:55.768
I haven't told All
or Ezra or anyone.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.509
So let's keep it our secret.

15:59.350 --> 16:02.012
That's not why
I asked you here, Aria.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.557
I need your help
with Ali.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.027
Okay.

16:06.030 --> 16:08.419
Well, she seems to be
completely under Mary's spell.

16:08.430 --> 16:10.853
I'm worried about her,
and she's not listening to me.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.462
Right before I left Ethiopia,
I discovered

16:12.470 --> 16:14.119
our Carissimi non-profit
had been

16:14.140 --> 16:15.960
completely drained of funds.

16:15.970 --> 16:17.460
Elliott?

16:17.470 --> 16:19.802
He didn't just
steal Ali's money--

16:19.810 --> 16:21.209
He took everything.

16:21.210 --> 16:24.577
[sighs]
Jason, I'm so sorry.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.275
I know how much your work
means to you

16:26.280 --> 16:28.271
and how important it is
to those kids.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.316
I hired a forensic accountant.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.049
I'm still trying to prove
Mary's involved

16:32.050 --> 16:34.211
but in the meantime..

16:34.220 --> 16:36.484
...I need your help.

16:37.760 --> 16:38.988
[instrumental music]

16:44.870 --> 16:48.328
It was so nice of the hotel
to comp a spa day.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.490
It's been a stressful 24 hours.

17:06.690 --> 17:08.681
[Oriental music on speakers]

17:16.730 --> 17:17.958
So what, you couldn't find

17:17.970 --> 17:19.267
Jenna's laptop,
but you found a lock box?

17:19.270 --> 17:20.965
Yeah. It's big enough.

17:20.970 --> 17:22.062
The laptop could be in there.

17:22.070 --> 17:24.334
Or it could be
something else.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.808
Did you tell Caleb?

17:31.380 --> 17:32.677
No.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.679
[instrumental music]

17:40.020 --> 17:41.442
You know,
you can turn the lights on.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.349
She wouldn't know
the difference.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.122
[instrumental music]

18:01.680 --> 18:04.137
No laptop, just papers.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.603
Got it.

18:13.150 --> 18:14.549
[door opens]

18:19.530 --> 18:20.849
[intense music]

18:53.900 --> 18:55.026
[grunts]

18:55.030 --> 18:56.395
[sniffs]

19:06.610 --> 19:09.033
Hi, I'm calling again
for Dr. Cochrane.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.406
'It's Noel Kahn.‘

19:11.410 --> 19:14.470
Tell her I'm running
out of time and patience.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.172
[sighs]

19:19.990 --> 19:21.480
[grunts]

19:27.700 --> 19:29.429
Good evening, I'm Emily

19:29.430 --> 19:30.920
and I'll be taking care
of you tonight.

19:30.930 --> 19:32.761
Well, look at you.

19:32.770 --> 19:34.567
[chuckles]

19:34.570 --> 19:35.696
This is the first time
you've seen the place

19:35.700 --> 19:37.133
since it's been
renovated, right?

19:37.140 --> 19:38.596
Yeah. Yeah.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.649
Yeah, uh, sorry, it's, uh..

19:48.650 --> 19:49.571
...a lottery alert.

19:49.580 --> 19:52.071
- Two hundred million.
- Ooh.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.614
Maybe we should get a ticket.

19:53.620 --> 19:54.689
Yeah.

19:54.690 --> 19:56.817
'Yo, what's up?‘

19:56.820 --> 19:58.310
[all screaming]

20:01.860 --> 20:03.851
[indistinct shouting]

20:05.500 --> 20:06.990
(woman)
'Bartender. .'

20:07.000 --> 20:08.092
Wow.

20:08.100 --> 20:10.239
They look...really excited.

20:16.310 --> 20:18.278
That why the Airstream
was broken into.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.043
Noel wanted that file.

20:20.050 --> 20:21.278
Well, if Noel did steal it

20:21.280 --> 20:23.111
then there's something in it
we didn't see.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.918
Yeah, something worth
breaking and entering for.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.017
[sighs]

20:28.020 --> 20:31.410
Okay, you beautiful mind.
What's that code mean?

20:32.560 --> 20:33.754
I don't know.
I'm gonna need

20:33.760 --> 20:35.921
some extra caffeine
to figure that out.

20:35.930 --> 20:39.991
Well, this is like some sort
of test, right? For Mary?

20:44.340 --> 20:45.898
Uh, yeah.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.736
It's her DNA.

20:52.680 --> 20:53.942
[all screaming]

20:55.920 --> 20:57.649
Is it as good as yours?

20:57.650 --> 20:59.208
- What?
- The steak.

20:59.220 --> 21:00.778
Is it as good
as you make it?

21:00.790 --> 21:04.157
Oh, it,
it was good, not great.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.583
It was, it was okay.

21:08.860 --> 21:10.327
[clears throat]

21:12.700 --> 21:14.725
Mom, what's wrong?

21:16.340 --> 21:17.568
It's dad, isn't it?

21:18.440 --> 21:20.704
I'm sorry, Em,
it's just that..

21:20.710 --> 21:22.678
[phone ringing]

21:22.680 --> 21:24.500
'You know it sounds silly,
but..'

21:24.510 --> 21:26.876
...I just, 1-1 feel guilty

21:26.880 --> 21:29.371
if I have fun
without your dad.

21:30.590 --> 21:33.150
Mom, remember that one birthday

21:33.150 --> 21:36.358
when we took dad to that
all-you-can-eat sushi buffet?

21:36.360 --> 21:39.852
- Okay, and he ate--
- Nine rolls. Yeah.

21:39.860 --> 21:43.352
- I remember.
- Dad didn't hold back.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.659
I mean, he loved us
and he loved life.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.197
You should, too.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.599
I know.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.285
No, thanks.

22:11.290 --> 22:13.588
- He doesn't drink.
- My apologies.

22:13.590 --> 22:15.797
I'll take it, Mary.
Thanks.

22:16.730 --> 22:18.550
Sorry, I should have told you.

22:33.410 --> 22:34.775
Well, this is nice.

22:36.320 --> 22:37.469
Just the three of us.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.718
[doorbell rings]

22:39.590 --> 22:41.319
Mm. I hope you guys don't mind

22:41.320 --> 22:43.015
but I invited a friend
to dinner.

22:44.460 --> 22:46.485
That's fine.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.458
We have enough food
to feed an army.

22:57.970 --> 22:59.460
Yvonne?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.979
Oh, Spencer, hi.

23:04.980 --> 23:06.607
Hi, how are you feeling?

23:06.610 --> 23:10.114
Uh, got some bruises,
cracked rib.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.917
But the doctors say
I'm lucky.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.649
[both laugh]

23:13.650 --> 23:16.118
What do they know, right?

23:16.120 --> 23:17.553
Hey.

23:17.560 --> 23:20.552
Babe, uh, they need you to sign
the release papers.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.391
- Yeah.
- Need some help?

23:22.400 --> 23:24.994
Don't be silly.
I'll be fine. Bye.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.092
Okay.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.639
I went to get Yvonne's things

23:34.640 --> 23:37.302
and the only thing missing
in that Airstream

23:37.310 --> 23:39.642
was that file.

23:39.650 --> 23:43.017
I'm so sorry that I dragged you
into the middle of this.

23:43.020 --> 23:45.409
Toby, I feel terrible.

23:45.420 --> 23:47.115
Well, I'm gonna find out
who took it.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.008
Listen, the only thing
that you need to do

23:49.020 --> 23:50.578
is pack up your things
and get Yvonne

23:50.590 --> 23:52.683
as far away
from this place as possible.

23:54.230 --> 23:55.891
What do you know that I don't?

24:01.500 --> 24:03.365
Toby, you're building
her a house.

24:03.370 --> 24:05.565
You can build her
a house anywhere.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.128
Okay? I need to
be here right now

24:07.140 --> 24:08.801
but you and Yvonne don't.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.604
Please.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.139
No one's ever really safe
in Rosewood.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.610
[excited chatter]

24:26.390 --> 24:28.688
Mom. Mom!

24:28.700 --> 24:31.351
I'm sorry, this is not how I
thought tonight was gonna be.

24:32.870 --> 24:34.360
(male #3)
'Here you are, ladies.‘

24:34.370 --> 24:36.065
- What?
- Um..

24:36.070 --> 24:37.697
No, we didn't order these.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.564
(male #3)
'Yeah, it's a, it's a gift.‘

24:41.780 --> 24:45.944
Oh! It's a, it's a peace
offering from the brides to be.

24:46.780 --> 24:48.975
- Hi.
- HI.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.178
They look like
they're having fun.

24:52.190 --> 24:55.546
You know what, I'm,
I'm gonna go thank them.

24:57.790 --> 24:59.257
Oh, I forgot my Cosmo.

25:00.130 --> 25:01.779
[indistinct chatter]

25:07.500 --> 25:08.762
[cheering]

25:09.800 --> 25:12.030
(Mary)
'Time for the main course.‘

25:15.740 --> 25:18.777
Tonight was supposed to be
about you giving her a chance.

25:18.780 --> 25:20.941
You've hardly said two words
to Mary since we sat down.

25:20.950 --> 25:22.577
Oh, I have words, Ali,
believe me.

25:22.580 --> 25:25.014
You just don't wanna listen.
You're too busy defending her.

25:25.020 --> 25:27.045
What the hell
are you doing here?

25:27.050 --> 25:28.711
You can at least
make an effort, Jason.

25:28.720 --> 25:29.982
Yeah, well, while you're
making an effort

25:29.990 --> 25:32.413
she's making off
with our silverware.

25:32.430 --> 25:34.182
Jason's just worried
about you.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.656
Elliot didn't just
drain your money.

25:35.660 --> 25:36.991
He drained
the Carissimi Group funds.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.627
And you know that Mary
was a part of it.

25:38.630 --> 25:40.860
- So you think she's playing me?
- She admitted to it.

25:40.870 --> 25:43.031
That she and Elliot were trying
to steal back Charlotte's money.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.667
Yeah, but she didn't
end up doing it.

25:44.670 --> 25:45.694
(Aria)
'You believe that?‘

25:45.710 --> 25:46.734
If she stole the money

25:46.740 --> 25:48.059
why would she still be here?

25:48.080 --> 25:50.469
Ali, I think
that you want to accept her

25:50.480 --> 25:51.777
more than you actually should.

25:51.780 --> 25:53.441
So that's why you're here.

25:53.450 --> 25:55.099
It's two against one.

25:59.390 --> 26:01.085
Hope you're hungry.

26:01.660 --> 26:03.355
Beef Wellington.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.816
My specialty.

26:06.090 --> 26:08.684
- Your specialty?
- Mm-hmm.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.099
That was my mom's specialty.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.523
She made it for
our birthdays every year.

26:12.530 --> 26:15.363
I suppose
it's a family recipe.

26:15.370 --> 26:18.168
And do you suppose you stole
my mother's necklace as well?

26:18.170 --> 26:19.637
(Ali)
'Jason!‘

26:21.480 --> 26:23.471
I gave it to her.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.879
You gave her mom's necklace?

26:26.480 --> 26:28.107
Can't you see?
She's manipulating you, Ali.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.418
It's working.
I mean, she's not mom.

26:30.420 --> 26:32.888
Jason, relax.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.845
(Mary)
'It's fine.‘

26:35.860 --> 26:39.921
I understand
how he must think of me.

26:39.930 --> 26:42.057
I mean, you never even got
the chance to know me.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.994
Your mom always kept us apart.

26:44.570 --> 26:45.594
What do you mean?

26:45.600 --> 26:47.363
Once these two were old enough

26:47.370 --> 26:48.394
to have any memories of me

26:48.400 --> 26:49.731
'she forbid me from coming back'

26:49.740 --> 26:50.968
'to Rosewood.‘

26:52.670 --> 26:55.662
But I did see Jason
some years ago.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.738
I'll just stay
for tonight, then.

26:56.740 --> 26:57.775
That's not a good idea.

26:57.780 --> 26:59.077
It's a mess in there.

26:59.080 --> 27:00.502
I don't care.
Mom, it's one night.

27:00.510 --> 27:02.148
I said no, Jason.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.714
I'll be done in a hour.

27:04.720 --> 27:05.948
I'll see you at home.

27:08.990 --> 27:10.389
[thud]

27:12.260 --> 27:15.320
- Is someone in there?
- That's just the wind.

27:29.380 --> 27:31.905
[car starts]

27:34.620 --> 27:37.544
Really, Mary,
pull yourself together.

27:37.550 --> 27:38.915
How could you be so cruel?

27:38.920 --> 27:41.582
I just found out
that my child is dead.

27:41.590 --> 27:43.057
I left him in your care.

27:43.060 --> 27:46.120
And I gave Charles the best life
that I could, Mary.

27:46.130 --> 27:47.779
I loved him with all my heart.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.098
How did it happen?

27:50.100 --> 27:52.455
I need to know. I need answers.
Please, tell me.

27:52.470 --> 27:55.325
You're not supposed to be here,
Mary. You know that.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.331
Jessica, please.

27:57.340 --> 27:59.900
It wasn't my fault.

27:59.910 --> 28:01.468
I gave him everything
that I could.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.836
I just don't understand why you
won't tell me what happened.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.909
You're not the victim here.

28:06.910 --> 28:10.516
You gave birth,
but he was my son.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.818
Don't ever forget that.

28:12.820 --> 28:14.219
And don't ever come back here.

28:30.400 --> 28:33.301
That's terrible that she didn't
tell you more about Charlotte.

28:33.310 --> 28:36.029
When Jessica decided
that a conversation was over..

28:37.480 --> 28:39.107
...it was over.

28:44.650 --> 28:46.811
Aunt Carol had
a storm cellar?

28:51.390 --> 28:52.414
[all laughing]

28:55.130 --> 28:57.519
Mary said Jessica used to have
a storm cellar

28:57.530 --> 28:59.054
she would spend
a lot of time in.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.197
It was news
to Ali and Jason, too.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.033
Uh, yeah, I used to hide
in my closet. And?

29:04.040 --> 29:05.792
Considering all the secrets
Jessica kept

29:05.810 --> 29:07.539
about Mary and Charlotte,
who knows what we'll find

29:07.540 --> 29:09.030
in that secret storm cellar?

29:09.040 --> 29:10.507
Wait, okay, so you think

29:10.510 --> 29:12.000
there might be something
down there

29:12.010 --> 29:13.978
that could help us find out
who she was close to?

29:13.980 --> 29:16.369
Or link us to someone
who might want revenge

29:16.380 --> 29:17.642
for Charlotte's murder.

29:17.650 --> 29:20.187
Emily, come on. Come on.

29:20.190 --> 29:21.817
Okay, look,
can we do this tomorrow?

29:21.820 --> 29:23.356
It's my mom's birthday.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.351
I, I can't tomorrow.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.521
It has to be tonight.

29:28.060 --> 29:29.129
Why?

29:30.500 --> 29:32.149
Ezra wants to elope.

29:33.100 --> 29:34.692
To Tuscany.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.395
Wow.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.805
But I could never do that.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.276
I, I mean,
not have you guys there?

29:44.280 --> 29:47.670
Aria, if-if that's what you
want, that's what you should do.

29:47.680 --> 29:50.808
I don't know. I think so.

29:51.950 --> 29:53.281
Em, you know what, no.

29:54.690 --> 29:56.487
I could never leave you guys.

29:56.490 --> 29:57.787
'Emily!‘

30:00.430 --> 30:02.728
In 20 years, you're not gonna
look back or remember

30:02.730 --> 30:05.426
that time you missed
breaking into a storm cellar.

30:05.430 --> 30:08.092
Okay, you're gonna remember
when you and Ezra

30:08.100 --> 30:10.591
became husband and wife.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.932
Hey, Hanna and Spencer and I
will go to Ali's aunt's

30:12.940 --> 30:14.009
tomorrow night
when no one's around

30:14.010 --> 30:15.966
and we'll fill you in.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.107
Aria, you're doing this for us.

30:18.110 --> 30:20.442
Please, go get hitched.

30:22.980 --> 30:24.845
I'm actually gonna do this.

30:26.550 --> 30:27.847
[indistinct chatter]

30:40.270 --> 30:42.488
I recognize the pattern,
but I'm not familiar

30:42.500 --> 30:43.899
with this encryption.

30:54.580 --> 30:55.604
[sighs]

30:55.620 --> 30:57.178
Jordan and I broke up.

30:59.750 --> 31:01.149
I thought you should know.

31:09.930 --> 31:11.329
Are you okay?

31:12.630 --> 31:15.963
Yeah, it's just...weird.

31:17.340 --> 31:20.207
Being so close to someone
and then..

31:20.210 --> 31:22.974
...having to cut them out
of your life completely.

31:25.180 --> 31:27.603
It's like losing a limb
or something or..

31:28.480 --> 31:30.038
...a part of you.

31:32.790 --> 31:35.042
[sighs]

31:35.860 --> 31:37.589
It'll get better, Han.

31:39.990 --> 31:41.582
I'm not talking about him.

31:50.740 --> 31:52.435
Are we still friends?

31:55.740 --> 31:57.037
Always.

32:11.530 --> 32:13.725
[excited chatter]

32:13.730 --> 32:15.083
So..

32:15.100 --> 32:16.624
...I'm meeting Margaret and Bree

32:16.630 --> 32:18.427
for book club on Saturday.

32:18.430 --> 32:19.692
But they are not inviting Keith

32:19.700 --> 32:21.065
so I really can't say anything.

32:21.070 --> 32:23.231
And then after that,
we're gonna go for tea

32:23.240 --> 32:25.367
at Margaret's, and I offered
to make some of those

32:25.370 --> 32:27.361
cucumber sandwiches
that you love so much.

32:27.370 --> 32:29.167
So I can save you some
if you want.

32:29.180 --> 32:30.670
Wow, you made some friends.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.477
Some actual fun friends.

32:32.480 --> 32:36.007
You know, Em, I have to admit,
tonight has really been a blast.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.612
- Good.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

32:37.620 --> 32:38.644
Ooh.

32:40.190 --> 32:41.646
[pop song on speaker]

32:42.460 --> 32:44.416
[cheering]

32:45.490 --> 32:47.048
Come on.

33:01.410 --> 33:03.071
Toby!

33:03.080 --> 33:05.071
Hey. Come in.

33:08.550 --> 33:12.247
So I've been, uh,
thinking a lot

33:12.250 --> 33:14.309
about what you said today.

33:14.320 --> 33:17.050
Ijust wanna be
honest with you.

33:20.430 --> 33:22.125
Okay.

33:25.230 --> 33:27.767
I didn't start building
the house for Yvonne.

33:30.940 --> 33:33.204
I was building it for you.

33:38.910 --> 33:41.242
But then, um..

33:41.250 --> 33:43.070
In those few minutes
that it took for me

33:43.080 --> 33:46.140
to get to the hospital,
I just..

33:48.560 --> 33:51.120
I couldn't imagine
my life without her.

34:00.100 --> 34:03.069
Yvonne has family in Maine.

34:05.110 --> 34:07.203
It's a small town.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.368
You like those.

34:11.010 --> 34:14.104
We both do, um, 50..

34:16.750 --> 34:19.218
We're gonna start
our family there.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.226
That sounds perfect.

34:29.960 --> 34:32.224
Well, nothing's ever perfect.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.195
But this is really close.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.352
I'll see you.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.457
Yeah.

35:22.550 --> 35:24.142
[sobbing]

35:25.720 --> 35:27.642
Goodbye.

35:37.200 --> 35:40.124
So Noel Kahn stole
Mary's Radley file

35:40.130 --> 35:41.461
and is shacking up with Jenna.

35:41.470 --> 35:42.892
Well, we don't know
if they're together

35:42.900 --> 35:44.231
but he definitely has in-and-out

35:44.240 --> 35:46.094
privileges in her hotel room.

35:46.110 --> 35:47.737
Maybe he's the reason
Sara Harvey

35:47.740 --> 35:48.764
slipped in the shower.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.976
There's nothing here.

35:51.980 --> 35:53.902
Cellars are
below ground, Hanna.

36:03.790 --> 36:04.859
Guys.

36:10.900 --> 36:12.549
[cellar door creaks]

36:14.170 --> 36:16.229
(Aria)
'Ugh! What's that smell?‘

36:16.240 --> 36:18.561
'Smells like grandma's house.‘

36:18.570 --> 36:21.130
Yeah, if grandma died,
was eaten by her cats

36:21.140 --> 36:23.404
and then found five days later.

36:23.410 --> 36:24.832
(Emily)
'Dark much?‘

36:24.850 --> 36:26.670
Well, it's just dark enough.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.087
'Guys, look at this.‘

36:34.090 --> 36:36.411
Jessica had a file
on each of us.

36:36.420 --> 36:38.285
She was investigating us.

36:39.590 --> 36:41.683
Yeah, all of us except Aria.
She doesn't have a file.

36:43.460 --> 36:44.688
Do you think somebody took it?

36:44.700 --> 36:45.928
Yeah, but why?

36:47.470 --> 36:49.722
She'd hidden
Mary's medical files, too.

36:52.270 --> 36:54.807
Jessica was in charge
of Mary's care.

36:56.640 --> 36:57.834
'Oh, my God!‘

36:57.840 --> 37:00.343
She authorized
electroshock therapy.

37:00.350 --> 37:02.500
Wait, back then, that was
like torture, right?

37:02.520 --> 37:03.441
Yeah!

37:03.450 --> 37:04.940
- Oh!
- What is it?

37:07.750 --> 37:09.115
Mary had a second child.

37:09.120 --> 37:10.280
- What?
- Wait, a second what?

37:10.290 --> 37:11.314
Boy or girl?

37:11.330 --> 37:13.116
All it says is "no complications

37:13.130 --> 37:14.757
'due to prior birth."'

37:14.760 --> 37:17.251
Hey, the kid would've been
our age by now.

37:18.400 --> 37:22.496
So Charlotte had
a biological brother or sister.

37:22.500 --> 37:24.161
Who might wanna revenge.

37:24.170 --> 37:25.467
(Hanna)
'Well, that's great.‘

37:25.470 --> 37:26.732
Now, you have another cousin
who wants

37:26.740 --> 37:27.764
to kill us.

37:31.910 --> 37:33.377
Passports, check.

37:33.380 --> 37:35.974
Luggage tags, check.

37:35.980 --> 37:40.246
Uh, we actually don't have
a luggage tag

37:40.250 --> 37:41.683
for the dress.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.487
Oh, no, no.

37:43.490 --> 37:46.584
We will not be checking
the wedding dress.

37:46.590 --> 37:49.559
It's delicate and lacy.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.289
Trust me. You're gonna
thank me later.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.297
[knock on door]

38:03.580 --> 38:06.504
- Are you Ezra Fitz?
- Yes.

38:06.510 --> 38:09.968
I'm Agent Lee from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

38:09.980 --> 38:12.676
_ You were involved
wrth NIcole Gordon, correct?

38:13.650 --> 38:14.514
Yes, I was.

38:14.520 --> 38:15.544
We have reason to believe

38:15.560 --> 38:17.380
that she may be alive.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.893
Why does your mom have
all these photos of us?

38:30.900 --> 38:33.562
And me when I was searching
for you guys.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.707
Damn, my hair looked good.

38:40.410 --> 38:42.674
The person my mom
was looking for was me.

38:47.350 --> 38:51.514
Last memory I have of her is
when she was burying me alive.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.855
'She knew I got out.'

39:01.640 --> 39:03.835
She never stopped searching.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.606
So this place
was kinda like her lair.

the keys are in the car.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.417
Just get inside, shut the doors.

It'll shut up
if you shut the doors.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.698
- Spencer, what are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

- What the hell is happening?
- You tell me, it's your car.

- Hanna, shut up.

Spence, do you have
a jack or anything

'under the seat to break
the window?‘

39:49.620 --> 39:51.349
I don't know. I'm really bad
at car maintenance.

39:51.350 --> 39:52.612
Spence, you have
to have something.

39:52.620 --> 39:54.542
It's probably
in the trunk, Emily.
