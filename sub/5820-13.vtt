00:01.600 --> 00:03.489
( Alarm blaring )

00:03.640 --> 00:05.005
Maggie:
They need our help.

00:05.160 --> 00:07.083
- ( Walkers growling )
- ( footsteps )

00:07.240 --> 00:09.641
-(snafls)
- ( slashes )

00:09.800 --> 00:11.325
( body thumps)

00:11.480 --> 00:14.723
( blaring continues )

00:14.880 --> 00:17.360
You are staying here.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.408
( Rustling )

00:30.920 --> 00:31.921
( hammer clicks )

00:34.200 --> 00:37.044
- ( man groans)
- Damn it, Maggie, let's go!

00:38.320 --> 00:39.685
Not until it's done.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.922
( Panting )

00:42.080 --> 00:44.811
Woman:
Stop! Or she's dead.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.088
( Hammers click)

00:50.240 --> 00:53.289
Woman: Guns, knives
on the ground right now.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.363
Nice jacket.

00:58.520 --> 01:00.488
For a murderous bitch.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.608
Woman: Well, we'll take it off her
before we shoot her.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.482
( Alarm continues )

01:17.000 --> 01:19.128
Man: It ain't on there right,
I can feel it. It ain't stopping.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.248
Woman #2: I'm getting it tighter.
Jesus, give me a second.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.811
Man: Son of a bitch,
you're cutting off my circulation.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.928
Woman #2:
Well, sport, it's supposed to.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.764
- ( Distant gunfire popping )
- Woman #3: Hell was that?

01:31.640 --> 01:34.371
Woman #1:
It's Primo.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.807
Damn it, they've got him.
Give me the walkie.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.531
Babe, what's happening?

01:39.680 --> 01:42.206
( Static crackling )

01:42.360 --> 01:44.522
Lower your gun, prick.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.089
Woman:
You, with the Colt Python.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.846
All of you,
lower your weapons right now.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.525
( Static crackles )

01:59.200 --> 02:00.964
( static crackles )

02:01.120 --> 02:03.646
Come on out. Let's talk.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.041
Woman #2:
How many we got?

02:06.200 --> 02:08.043
Woman:
Eight in sight.

02:08.199 --> 02:09.610
Too many.

02:09.759 --> 02:12.047
No, we can take 'em.
We took more.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.804
- ( Static hisses )
- We're not coming out,

02:16.960 --> 02:18.564
but we will talk.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.722
Names.

02:20.880 --> 02:24.089
- Names!
- I'm Maggie, she's Carol.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.720
Woman: We've got a Carol
and a Maggie.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.645
I'm thinking that's something
you want to chat about.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.121
Now, we're gonna
work this out right now,

02:34.280 --> 02:37.090
- and it's going to go our way.
- ( static hisses )

02:39.160 --> 02:42.846
( Silent )

02:43.000 --> 02:44.764
( static hisses )

02:44.920 --> 02:48.129
You can see we have
one of yours.

02:48.280 --> 02:49.805
We'll trade.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.088
- ( Static hisses )
- I'm listening.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.447
Rick on radio: First I want to talk
to Maggie and Carol,

02:54.600 --> 02:56.807
- make sure they're all right.
- ( walker growling )

02:56.960 --> 02:58.485
I'm gonna put you on.
You say you're fine.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.369
I'll know if you try
anything else.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.921
Rick, it's Carol.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.162
- I'm-- I'm fine, but--
- Now you.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.970
Rick, it's Maggie.
We're both okay.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.844
- We'll figure thi--
- Shut up.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.088
Woman: You have your proof.
Let's talk.

03:11.240 --> 03:15.040
Rick: All right,
this is the deal right here.

03:15.200 --> 03:19.444
Let 'em go, and you can have
your guy back and live.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.206
Two for one,
that's not much of a trade.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.204
Rick:
You don't have another choice

03:25.360 --> 03:27.681
or you would've done
something about it already.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.651
We have to get him back.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.529
Primo can take care of himself.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.808
He can patch me up.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.406
I need him,
thanks to that bitch.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.842
You lost your balls, Paula.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.048
You should've shot her in the head
so they could hear her die.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.368
If you could just shut up,
I'll solve this.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.569
- Then make the deal or we go in.
- She said shut up, so shut it.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.165
You should be glad
she doesn't have

03:51.320 --> 03:53.641
- a sack of gonads to trip over.
- ( static hisses )

03:53.800 --> 03:56.087
Rick: Look, I know
you're talking it over.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.844
It's a fair trade.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.561
Just come out, we do this,

04:01.760 --> 04:03.728
we all walk away.

04:03.880 --> 04:06.042
Smug prick.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.089
He must think we're stupid.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.924
- That's a good thing.
- ( static hisses )

04:10.080 --> 04:14.529
- Rick: Do we have a deal?
- ( walker snarling )

04:14.680 --> 04:16.728
- ( static hisses )
- Paula: I'll get back to you.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.928
( Growling continues )

04:25.360 --> 04:28.443
( theme music playing )

05:03.200 --> 05:04.884
( panting )

05:05.040 --> 05:06.724
Paula:
Move!

05:12.400 --> 05:14.243
Turn.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.729
Paula:
Wait.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.448
( Car door closes )

05:27.600 --> 05:29.329
- ( static hisses )
- Paula: Omega, omega, Saviors down.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.767
Go to Gamma, code "fire."

05:33.080 --> 05:34.923
( static hisses )

05:35.080 --> 05:37.242
Paula: Alpha channel is not clear.
We follow the protocol.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.090
( Static hisses )

05:39.240 --> 05:41.083
Paula:
Where the hell are you guys?

05:41.240 --> 05:42.651
( Static hisses )

05:42.800 --> 05:44.325
Man on radio:
Out west of the--

05:44.480 --> 05:47.211
- ( static hissing )
- Man: 15 mi-- on-- way.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.771
Paula:
We're headed to the break point.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.366
Switch to Theta channel,
same code.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.363
If I'm not there,
toggle to Alpha, listen in.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.807
- ( Static hisses )
- Man: Copy that.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.968
(keys jingle)

05:58.120 --> 06:00.964
-( lock clicks )
- ( door squeaks )

06:01.120 --> 06:03.600
Woman #2:
I hate this damn place.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.802
- Safe house.
- ( walkers growling )

06:05.960 --> 06:07.530
Ain't nothing safe about it.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.802
Paula: This place
is gonna save our asses.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.689
( Door closes )

06:13.440 --> 06:16.125
( snarling )

06:24.520 --> 06:26.648
Paula:
Get on the ground.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.484
You, there.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.960
You, over there.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.686
You're wondering
if there's a way out of this.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.923
There isn't.
Not unless I say so.

07:09.240 --> 07:11.527
( Duct tape ripping )

07:19.320 --> 07:21.971
- ( walker growling )
- Woman #3: Paula, I need backup!

07:22.120 --> 07:24.009
(gunfire)

07:26.040 --> 07:29.522
I want to kill you both right now.
It's taking all I have not to,

07:29.680 --> 07:31.444
so go ahead, I dare you,
try something.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.364
Just see what happens.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.249
( slams )

07:39.680 --> 07:41.682
( faint gunfire rattles )

07:46.280 --> 07:48.487
( distant walker snarling )

07:48.640 --> 07:50.642
( gunfire continues )

07:58.960 --> 08:00.883
( scraping )

08:01.080 --> 08:03.481
(grunts)

08:20.680 --> 08:22.409
(grunts)

08:24.040 --> 08:26.441
( gunfire stops )

08:41.440 --> 08:44.364
( panting )

08:50.280 --> 08:52.248
( panting continues )

08:53.760 --> 08:55.364
When's the last time
anyone checked this place?

08:55.520 --> 08:57.409
Woman #3:
It was fine a month ago.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.289
Woman #2: Sweetie, that was
a month ago. Shit hards quick.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.886
The guns have gone bye-bye,
the food's gone bye-bye,

09:02.040 --> 09:04.281
and we got growlers
up and down the halls.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.482
Man: Means people
can get through, too.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.130
- Maybe we should get gone.
- Carol!

09:08.280 --> 09:09.441
- Woman #3: Yeah? Where the hell to?
- Nowhere.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.762
Got dead in the halls?
Free security.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.127
Those assholes get here
before our people,

09:14.320 --> 09:16.049
the cold bloods
will buy us some time.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.163
- ( Panting continues )
- Shut up.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.322
Jesus, it's bleeding.
It's not supposed to keep bleeding.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.643
- Molly, give me the rope.
- Man: I'm not losing it. I'm not.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.609
Woman #3: So you grind it out.
Jesus, Donnie.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.650
Donnie: Screw you, 'Chelle!
We have to get him back.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.609
He can fix it.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.649
- We have to, Paula.
- No.

09:32.840 --> 09:36.162
I saw them, you didn't.
They took the place down,

09:36.320 --> 09:37.845
they got the guns,
they'll kill us, too.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.240
( Maggie, muffled )
Hey!

09:39.400 --> 09:42.290
I'm not going down like that,
not after making it this far.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.010
( Muffled )

09:44.160 --> 09:46.481
- Maggie: Hey!
- ( Carol panting )

09:49.160 --> 09:51.128
What?

09:51.280 --> 09:54.204
She's hyperventilating.
Somebody needs to take her gag off.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.968
( Panting continues )

10:01.560 --> 10:04.450
She's a nervous little bird,
ain't she?

10:06.040 --> 10:07.690
( Gasps )

10:07.840 --> 10:09.490
( hammer clicks )

10:11.320 --> 10:13.607
Look at you.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.683
Bitch, how did you
make it this far?

10:15.880 --> 10:18.167
Honey, you need to take
some yoga breaths

10:18.320 --> 10:20.641
and calm your ass down.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.802
( Panting )
I can't--

10:28.520 --> 10:31.046
( panting continues )

10:36.160 --> 10:37.400
Molly:
Oh.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.531
You're one of those.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.562
( Gasping slows )

10:55.920 --> 10:58.127
What are you so afraid of?

11:03.360 --> 11:06.091
Are you actually afraid to die?

11:07.680 --> 11:09.091
( Scoffs )

11:09.240 --> 11:13.768
All this and you're scared
of getting your ticket punched.

11:17.240 --> 11:20.084
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.210
Just don't hurt Maggie.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.169
Don't hurt the baby.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.208
'Chelle:
Yeah, right.

11:41.920 --> 11:44.526
Donnie: She got a bun in the oven,
she doesn't look it.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.451
Maggie: I'm only two months,
I think.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.450
You're some kind of stupid,

11:50.640 --> 11:52.722
getting knocked up
at a time like this.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.281
You think that's funny?

11:55.480 --> 11:58.802
When was it ever smart
to get knocked up?

11:58.960 --> 12:01.964
Women used to just die
in childbirth.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.327
And they always thought
the world was gonna end.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.324
Living through it,
why would you just give up?

12:07.480 --> 12:10.245
But are you gonna
live through it?

12:12.200 --> 12:14.726
Anyway, that's cute.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.241
Babies are the point.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.721
Children are our future.

12:21.480 --> 12:24.848
Making bite-size snacks
for the dead.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.731
The point is to stay standing.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.803
No.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.611
Walkers do that.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.161
I'm choosing something.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.842
That's right.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.889
You are.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.042
You did.

12:49.840 --> 12:53.128
- ( Door slams )
- ( Donnie groaning)

12:57.160 --> 12:59.401
- ( lighter clicks )
- ( Donnie grunts)

13:03.200 --> 13:06.329
( Molly coughing )

13:07.880 --> 13:10.042
Carol:
The baby.

13:11.760 --> 13:15.082
(laughing)

13:17.720 --> 13:21.202
Honey, in case
you haven't noticed,

13:21.400 --> 13:25.086
you've got bigger problems
than a little secondhand smoke.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.287
Molls.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.324
Y'all are worse than a bunch

13:37.480 --> 13:41.246
of evangelical second graders.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.801
(coughing )

13:43.960 --> 13:46.122
( hacking )

13:53.240 --> 13:56.084
Those things'll kill you.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.368
They already have.

13:58.560 --> 14:02.007
I'm a dead woman walkin'.

14:02.160 --> 14:06.529
Which puts us
in exactly the same boat.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.923
( laughs, coughing )

14:11.520 --> 14:13.807
( coughing continues )

14:22.960 --> 14:25.804
Agh!
(groaning )

14:25.960 --> 14:27.803
My arm feels like it's on fire.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.611
You pull that off, you gonna be
nothing but a spigot.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.962
- Okay, hold on.
- ( grunts )

14:33.120 --> 14:36.647
Scout crew is coming.
They're 30 minutes out, maybe less.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.246
Maggie:
He doesn't have 30 minutes.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.966
His nerves are dying.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.441
If he doesn't get medical help,
he's gonna lose his arm,

14:44.600 --> 14:47.570
maybe his life.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.042
I'm not a doctor, but my dad
lost his leg, and I know that much.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.689
Your man, Primo,
you think he can help you?

15:02.760 --> 15:05.001
It's time to end this.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.322
Talk to Rick.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.083
30 minutes.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.970
You know my problem?
( panting )

15:34.200 --> 15:36.965
She did this to me.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.810
She did it
and she's just sitting there

15:38.960 --> 15:40.610
right as rain, fully intact.

15:40.760 --> 15:44.207
- Paula: Hey.
- No, you're not gonna make the trade.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.681
And we just do 'em both now.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.204
Paula:
No, we wait for the others.

15:50.360 --> 15:53.409
We have to be smart.
We need insurance.

15:53.560 --> 15:54.846
Then shoot her in the arm, too.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.048
( Chuckles )
No.

15:57.200 --> 16:01.205
You really gonna stick up
for some gutless bitch over me?

16:04.600 --> 16:07.888
- God damn it!
- Paula: Shut up.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.849
Donnie:
Don't push me, Paula.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.367
- ( Donnie groans )
- Paula: Shut up!

16:18.840 --> 16:20.251
Leave her alone!

16:23.320 --> 16:25.721
No! No!

16:25.920 --> 16:27.445
( Screams )

16:27.600 --> 16:29.921
You dumb, uppity bitch!

16:33.640 --> 16:36.007
(grunting )

16:37.560 --> 16:39.483
(thumps)

16:43.960 --> 16:47.043
You really are
some kind of stupid.

16:49.160 --> 16:52.403
Take her out.
See if she knows anything.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.881
Should've done that before.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.729
Move.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.680
- ( Walkers growling )
- ( door slams )

17:11.839 --> 17:14.445
(growling )

17:19.920 --> 17:22.127
'Chelle:
You got nice clothes,

17:22.280 --> 17:25.647
time to make babies.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.043
You're holed up
somewhere good.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.682
- Tell me where.
-(sass)

17:35.960 --> 17:39.328
( retches )

17:48.440 --> 17:50.124
Don't draw this out, bitch.

17:50.280 --> 17:53.648
Just tell me where.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.969
Help yourself
and the baby in your belly.

17:58.440 --> 18:02.081
The way you stay alive
is you produce for us.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.800
You're not the good guys.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.527
You should know that.

18:15.360 --> 18:18.842
- Molly: He got you good, kid.
- He's in pain.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.207
Guys can't handle pain.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.603
- Carol: Excuse me?
-( Paula sighs)

18:29.480 --> 18:31.767
Just wanted to say
thank you

18:31.960 --> 18:35.487
for helping Maggie,
for helping me.

18:38.280 --> 18:39.770
My husband Ed, he used to--

18:39.920 --> 18:42.287
Yeah?
I don't care if your old man

18:42.440 --> 18:44.408
used to ring your bell.

18:44.600 --> 18:49.401
I see exactly
who you are, Carol.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.962
I know.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.724
You're pathetic.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.645
You wanna think
we're just the same?

18:57.800 --> 19:01.327
Go ahead.
You're wrong.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.529
He's just a warm body
for my bed.

19:04.680 --> 19:08.526
That's it.
I could kill him in his sleep.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.608
( Chuckles )

19:24.000 --> 19:26.810
Do you really believe
in that crap?

19:32.920 --> 19:36.367
My faith got me through the death
of my daughter.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.567
Paula:
Hmm.

19:37.720 --> 19:41.042
Well, the good news is
maybe you'll see her again soon.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.882
( 'Chelle wincing )

19:49.560 --> 19:51.961
Maggie:
What happened?

19:53.400 --> 19:55.721
I stole something.
Got caught.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.488
What?

19:59.640 --> 20:02.769
Gas, from this place.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.649
- Why?
- To get a new car.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.962
And look
for my boyfriend's body.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.885
Did you find him?

20:11.040 --> 20:13.486
He was blown up.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.927
Not much to find.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.524
"Frankie."

20:22.680 --> 20:25.524
- Was that his name?
- Hell, no.

20:25.680 --> 20:29.287
I barely knew him.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.124
He was a dick.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.721
Frank was my dad.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.881
And that's what I was
gonna name the baby.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.930
- I'm sorry.
- No.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.722
You aren't.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.087
I'm not planning to die today.

21:00.240 --> 21:03.289
Yeah, me neither.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.286
Thing is, one of us is wrong.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.450
Just tell me where.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.649
( 'Chelle sighs )

21:29.800 --> 21:32.770
Rick on radio:
Have you thought about it?

21:32.920 --> 21:34.285
Talk to me.

21:34.440 --> 21:37.171
(walkers growling )

21:37.320 --> 21:39.766
- ( static hissing )
- You weren't listening.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.321
I said I'd contact you.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.084
- ( Static hissing )
- Rick: Would it make a difference

21:44.280 --> 21:46.282
if I said I was sorry
about that?

21:46.440 --> 21:48.602
What do you think?

21:48.760 --> 21:51.843
- ( Static hissing )
- I think we're gonna make the trade,

21:52.000 --> 21:53.650
so tell me where.

21:56.280 --> 21:58.362
We haven't agreed to that.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.444
- ( Static hissing )
- Rick: You will.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.809
You know what?
I'm not so sure.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.361
We'd be taking
most of the risk,

22:08.520 --> 22:11.171
not getting much
in the way of a reward.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.810
( Static hissing )

22:12.960 --> 22:15.884
Rick: The other option
won't work out for you.

22:19.120 --> 22:22.044
We'll take our chances.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.684
( Sighs )
You don't have to do this.

22:32.840 --> 22:37.323
- You don't have to fight.
- Your people killed all of my people.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.686
Of course we gotta fight.

22:38.840 --> 22:42.208
- We didn't want to.
- But you did.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.488
So tell me why.

22:47.080 --> 22:50.243
Your people ambushed
my people on the road,

22:50.400 --> 22:52.528
tried to take everything
we had.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.605
They were gonna kill them.

22:58.760 --> 23:01.331
Well, damn.

23:01.520 --> 23:05.969
So now we know
what happened to T's group.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.805
Those idiots.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.849
Probably put on a big show.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.049
Okay, fair play.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.051
You were just defending
yourselves.

23:20.640 --> 23:25.328
But, see, your people killed them
on the road, right?

23:25.480 --> 23:28.609
Blew them to pieces.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.007
So, why not stop?

23:35.840 --> 23:38.366
They said they were working
for Negan.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.371
And what do you think
you know about Negan?

23:44.520 --> 23:48.127
He sounded like a maniac.
We were scared. We had to stop him.

23:48.320 --> 23:51.164
Sweetie, sweetie.

23:51.360 --> 23:54.045
We are all Negan.

23:57.120 --> 24:00.806
- What do you mean?
- ( Molly coughing )

24:03.480 --> 24:05.721
What does that mean?

24:05.920 --> 24:09.527
(coughing )

24:20.440 --> 24:23.489
( walkers growling faintly )

24:27.720 --> 24:29.370
Can I have one?

24:30.640 --> 24:33.564
Well, look at you,
little bird.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.690
I didn't think you approved.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.002
I don't.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.251
( Lighter clicks )

25:01.280 --> 25:04.762
You are weak.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.241
What are you so afraid of?

25:09.600 --> 25:12.729
So scared, you can't even stick
to your own principles.

25:15.800 --> 25:18.963
You don't want me
to stick to my own principles.

25:28.440 --> 25:32.331
I was a secretary before.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.731
I fetched coffee for my boss

25:38.880 --> 25:41.611
and made him feel good
about himself.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.728
I spent most
of my days reading

25:43.880 --> 25:46.326
stupid inspirational e-mails

25:46.520 --> 25:48.921
to try and feel good
about myself.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.482
There was this one
that kept going around.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.689
A young woman
was having a hard time

25:55.840 --> 25:58.605
and told her mom
she wanted to give up,

25:58.760 --> 26:00.410
so her mom went
to the kitchen

26:00.560 --> 26:03.803
and started boiling
three pots of water.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.361
She put a carrot in one,
an egg in another,

26:06.520 --> 26:09.046
and ground coffee beans
in the last one.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.369
After they had boiled a while,
her mom said,

26:12.520 --> 26:16.161
"Look, all three things went through
the same boiling water.

26:16.320 --> 26:19.608
The carrot went in strong
and came out soft.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.963
The egg was fragile
and came out hard.

26:23.120 --> 26:27.170
But the coffee beans
changed the water itself."

26:30.680 --> 26:33.570
You're supposed to want to be
the coffee beans.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.121
See, to me,
coffee was just a thing

26:39.320 --> 26:41.049
that my boss would drink up.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.163
No matter how many times
I refilled his damn cup,

26:43.320 --> 26:46.130
it was just never enough.

26:49.880 --> 26:53.441
I was at work when the Army
took over DC.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.529
We weren't allowed to leave.

26:56.680 --> 27:00.127
They had to evacuate
all the important people first--

27:00.280 --> 27:03.841
members of Congress,
government employees.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.924
So I was stuck with my boss.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.367
Not my family--

27:09.560 --> 27:11.881
my husband,

27:12.040 --> 27:14.281
my four girls...

27:19.320 --> 27:21.561
( sniffles )

27:25.520 --> 27:28.046
My boss was weak and stupid
and he was going to die

27:28.200 --> 27:30.521
and he was going
to take me down, too.

27:30.680 --> 27:33.411
He was the first person
I killed

27:33.560 --> 27:35.528
so that I could live.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.769
I stopped counting
when I hit double digits.

27:39.920 --> 27:43.083
That's right around the time
I stopped feeling bad about it.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.287
I am not like you.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.127
I'm still me, but better.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.489
I lost everything
and it made me stronger.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.449
You sure about that?

27:57.600 --> 27:59.125
I'm alive.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.527
With those people, those killers.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.728
Your people are killers, Carol.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.804
That makes you a killer.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.802
You-- you're the one.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.724
Excuse me?

28:23.880 --> 28:26.451
You're the one
who's afraid to die.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.246
And you're going to.

28:29.400 --> 28:32.882
You will die.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.371
It's what's gonna happen
if you don't work this out.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.486
Are you going to kill me?

28:45.160 --> 28:47.481
I hope not.

28:55.640 --> 29:00.407
- ( Static hissing )
- Asshole, are you there?

29:00.560 --> 29:02.562
Rick on radio:
I'm here.

29:05.120 --> 29:08.169
We've thought about it.
We want to make the trade.

29:08.320 --> 29:10.641
Rick:
That's good.

29:10.800 --> 29:14.168
There's a large field with a sign
that says "God is dead"

29:14.320 --> 29:17.642
about two miles down I-66.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.371
Good visibility in all directions.

29:20.520 --> 29:24.525
Rick: We'll meet you there.
10 minutes?

29:24.680 --> 29:26.569
10 minutes.

29:29.800 --> 29:33.168
Mm-mm.
Now, that was too easy.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.766
Molly: Maybe they're just itching
to get their people back.

29:35.960 --> 29:37.803
Paula: No, there was no static.
There should've been static.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.889
They're close.
They're probably already here.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.530
We were careful,
but there were tracks.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.125
- There had to be.
- No...

29:43.280 --> 29:45.009
They killed everybody back home.
They have the weapons.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.209
They know what they're doing.
They're probably waiting to kill us

29:48.360 --> 29:49.725
as soon as we walk out
those doors.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.008
- That's what we'd do.
- Carol: No.

29:54.720 --> 29:57.724
You have to listen to me, please.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.565
Rick is a man of his word.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.451
He wouldn't put me and Maggie
at risk to attack.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.604
Then he's just as stupid
as you are.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.444
( Knob clicking )

30:08.600 --> 30:10.682
- ( static hisses )
- What's your ETA?

30:10.840 --> 30:12.524
- ( Static hisses )
- Man on radio: A few minutes away,

30:12.680 --> 30:14.682
- but the car is running on fumes.
- Paula: We have gas.

30:14.840 --> 30:16.649
We'll fill you up
and then we move.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.802
Radio when you're back
in the perimeter.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.446
- ( Static hisses )
- Man: Copy that.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.568
We gotta get ready.

30:23.720 --> 30:26.769
Pull 'Chelle out so she doesn't
get stuck in a fight.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.809
We have to be ready
to move at any second.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.564
Molly:
What about the girl?

30:32.440 --> 30:36.411
Leave her for now.
If we leave, we travel light.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.922
And if the pricks are here,
we pick 'em off at the door.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.606
( Snarling )

30:50.520 --> 30:52.568
Paula:
Molls, we need this hall clear.

31:02.400 --> 31:05.529
( Sighs )

31:09.480 --> 31:11.608
( scraping )

31:26.240 --> 31:29.244
(walker snarling )

31:31.040 --> 31:32.724
( panting )

31:32.880 --> 31:35.326
Just a sec, sugar.

31:38.720 --> 31:40.529
(grunts)

31:51.080 --> 31:52.809
( gasps )

32:04.160 --> 32:05.844
Are you okay?

32:06.000 --> 32:08.241
I have to be.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.204
They've spread out, but I think
we can make it past them.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.880
- We have to try.
- We can't leave them alive.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.168
- No, we should just go.
- Carol, we have to finish this.

32:15.320 --> 32:17.163
We have to.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.285
( Blood tricking )

33:00.360 --> 33:02.442
( breath rasping )

33:03.880 --> 33:06.121
He was already dead.

33:06.280 --> 33:09.762
- He's turning.
- We should go.

33:11.160 --> 33:12.969
We need a gun.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.925
Give me that.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.764
( Faint growling )

33:34.240 --> 33:36.208
- ( snarling )
- ( screaming )

33:45.080 --> 33:48.721
Eat shit and die, Donnie!

33:48.920 --> 33:51.366
Where are ya, magnolia?

33:51.520 --> 33:53.966
I wanna bloody up that nice--

33:54.120 --> 33:55.804
(gags)

33:55.960 --> 33:58.691
Agh!

33:58.840 --> 34:00.330
(thumping )

34:00.480 --> 34:04.041
( shouting )

34:04.200 --> 34:06.487
( screams, panting )

34:08.040 --> 34:09.690
Maggie:
Go.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.768
( Door slams )

34:36.239 --> 34:38.129
( Clicks )

34:41.960 --> 34:44.007
( walkers snarling )

34:55.360 --> 34:58.728
Carol: They're using them
to keep us in, keep the others out.

35:01.640 --> 35:05.531
Maggie: Come on.
We have to find 'em.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.241
( Gunshots )

35:11.400 --> 35:13.402
( trigger clicks )

35:17.480 --> 35:19.289
( hammer clicks )

35:19.440 --> 35:20.680
Just run.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.842
<i>Shoot her.</i>

35:23.000 --> 35:27.289
- ( blade rings )
- Go on, do it.

35:27.440 --> 35:31.206
You've killed Donnie,
you've killed Molly.

35:31.360 --> 35:34.250
Your people have
destroyed my home.

35:34.440 --> 35:36.169
- Get outta here.
- Carol.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.522
You have no idea.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.251
The things I've done,

35:41.400 --> 35:43.209
what I've given up,

35:43.360 --> 35:46.250
what I had to do.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.368
- Just run.
- Maggie: Carol, shoot her.

35:48.520 --> 35:51.729
Go ahead.
I've already lost everything.

35:51.880 --> 35:53.484
-(snafls)
-(gunshot)

35:53.640 --> 35:55.927
(grunts)

35:56.080 --> 35:58.287
'Chelle:
Paula?

35:58.440 --> 36:00.204
Paula?

36:00.360 --> 36:02.089
( Door squeaks )

36:02.240 --> 36:04.242
'Chelle:
Molly?

36:06.160 --> 36:09.004
(grunting )

36:15.240 --> 36:17.561
You lying bitch!

36:17.720 --> 36:20.200
( Panting )

36:25.280 --> 36:27.123
(walkers growling )

36:30.600 --> 36:32.489
( Paula groans )

36:35.920 --> 36:37.763
I'll do it.

36:39.440 --> 36:42.091
( Paula laughs )

36:42.240 --> 36:45.005
You're good.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.481
Nervous little bird.

36:48.720 --> 36:51.087
You were her.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.883
But not now, right?

36:58.960 --> 37:00.325
Me, too.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.203
I told you to run.

37:05.360 --> 37:08.330
Paula:
If you could do all this,

37:08.480 --> 37:12.087
what were you
so afraid of, Carol?

37:24.320 --> 37:27.130
I was afraid of this.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.362
( laughs )

37:33.000 --> 37:34.684
(grunting )

37:43.760 --> 37:46.206
( screaming )

37:47.520 --> 37:49.682
(grunts)

37:49.840 --> 37:52.286
( screaming )

37:56.280 --> 37:58.248
Man on radio: Paula,
we're approaching the perimeter.

37:58.400 --> 38:01.449
- Are we a go?
- ( Paula screaming )

38:03.080 --> 38:05.321
(Paula gurgling)

38:11.240 --> 38:13.447
Man:
Do you copy?

38:18.280 --> 38:21.363
( Static hisses )

38:21.520 --> 38:24.000
( imitating Paula )
Meet us on the kill floor.

38:28.920 --> 38:32.766
I think I might have killed
18 people.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.445
20.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.601
I should've killed
Donnie, too, in the woods.

38:39.760 --> 38:42.604
I had a clear shot.
I didn't miss.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.924
None of this would've happened
if I had just killed him.

38:49.080 --> 38:52.323
- Don't think about it.
- I can't stop.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.967
We're almost done.

38:56.120 --> 38:58.327
( Footsteps passing )

39:12.360 --> 39:14.727
Man:
Careful. The floor's slick.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.450
Man #2:
You sure this is it?

39:16.600 --> 39:18.602
Man:
She said "kill floor."

39:18.760 --> 39:21.047
( lighter clicks )

39:21.200 --> 39:24.283
Man #3:
Hey, this one's locked.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.966
( Rumbling )

39:28.440 --> 39:29.965
What the hell?! Agh!

39:30.120 --> 39:32.122
( Screaming,
pounding on door)

39:33.720 --> 39:36.451
( screaming,
pounding continue )

40:08.080 --> 40:11.323
( distorted growling )

40:43.400 --> 40:45.209
( voice echoes )
Maggie.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.646
You okay?

40:46.800 --> 40:49.007
We got your trail.

40:49.160 --> 40:51.606
- You start a fire?
- Yeah.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.087
Hey. you good?

40:54.240 --> 40:55.890
No.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.769
Come here.

40:59.240 --> 41:02.084
They're dead. They're all dead,
the ones that took us.

41:02.240 --> 41:04.083
They're all dead.

41:04.240 --> 41:07.687
Hey. are you okay?

41:07.840 --> 41:10.241
I just...

41:10.440 --> 41:13.364
I can't anymore.

41:13.520 --> 41:16.888
- Glenn: It's okay.
- Your friends are dead.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.646
No one's coming for ya.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.165
So you might as well talk.

41:21.320 --> 41:24.244
Let him burn.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.961
I'm gonna ask you
one last time...

41:28.120 --> 41:30.600
- how'd you get the bike?
- We found it.

41:30.760 --> 41:32.842
- Daryl: Like hell you did.
- We found it.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.570
Was Negan in that building
last night

41:34.760 --> 41:36.444
or was he here?

41:39.600 --> 41:42.046
(grunts)

41:42.200 --> 41:44.043
Both.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.321
I'm Negan, shithead.

41:49.800 --> 41:52.371
There's a whole world of fun
that we can talk about,

41:52.520 --> 41:54.727
- so let's have a chat.
- I'm sorry it had to come to this.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.531
( Gunshot echoes )

42:16.720 --> 42:19.644
( theme music playing )
