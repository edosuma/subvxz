I chose to live with my dad

I'm nervous to leave him alone.
I think he'll be lonely.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.636
He neglects his appearance.

02:16.719 --> 02:21.975
He just kind of dresses in a funny way,
because he kind of takes on that, like,

02:22.725 --> 02:24.227
funny big guy persona.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.353

02:30.024 --> 02:31.985
When did your parents get divorced?

02:32.068 --> 02:33.194
Six years ago now.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.905
And they were struggling a lot
before that.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.825
The weird part about it, though,
is that my mom and dad,

02:38.908 --> 02:39.868
they're best friends.

02:39.951 --> 02:40.785
That's cute.

-Yes.

is borderline not healthy.

Since my divorce,
I just never had the gumption,

03:09.564 --> 03:12.442
I guess is a way of phrasing it,
to get back out there.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.069

03:15.737 --> 03:18.072
Not someone that anyone
would wanna be with.

03:18.656 --> 03:19.908

really, really confident.

he's worthy of love.

-Yeah.

-Why is there a lady's top in here?

07:25.653 --> 07:27.321
Why didn't she take it today?

wear any of it again.

-if I get rid of her stuff.
-No. It's your house.

to come and get it.

are basically all of her stuff.

your hanging stuff was. Interesting.

from your bed.

of ruffling feathers or anything?

09:03.918 --> 09:06.087
Love to keep my hair slicked back.

09:06.170 --> 09:10.383
So that's what I love to use all the time.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.592
I noticed.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.843
[laughs]

09:12.927 --> 09:14.971
If a brick fell from the sky,

09:15.054 --> 09:16.639
I do believe that you would survive it

09:16.722 --> 09:18.724
because it would bounce off the gel
in your hair,

09:18.808 --> 09:21.602
but I love that about you,
'cause safety first.

09:21.686 --> 09:22.520
[laughs]

09:22.937 --> 09:25.690
-[Karamo] Why are there two recliners?
-[Bobby] I don't know.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.236
[Antoni]
Oh, my gosh. Look at the state of that.

09:33.990 --> 09:34.991
Oh, that's not good.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.285
This is bad.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.915
When it comes to looking in the mirror
and liking what you see,

09:42.999 --> 09:44.333
where does that land for you?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.711
[Kevin] When I look in the mirror,
I just see a strange person

09:46.794 --> 09:48.713
because I have lost teeth.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.924
I'm afraid of what they're thinking
when they see me smile,

09:52.008 --> 09:53.843
and they see that teeth are missing,

09:53.926 --> 09:56.804
and they're like, "What's up with him?"

09:56.887 --> 10:00.474
You know? And I think that takes away
from meeting other people.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.561
But even you as you are
right here, right now,

10:03.644 --> 10:06.397
are completely lovable
and completely acceptable.

10:06.522 --> 10:07.481
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.233
I wanna, like, kind of uncover

10:09.317 --> 10:10.860
what's going on beneath that beard.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.945
I want a dry, soft touch,

10:13.029 --> 10:15.072
where you can run your fingers
through your hair

10:15.156 --> 10:16.907
and maybe even someday...

10:17.408 --> 10:18.534
Have a woman do that to me?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.036
-Yes. Look.
-I would love that, too.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.538
[Tan] Somebody else will run their fingers
through your hair.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.708
-I wanna look at your closet, though.
-[Jonathan] Go! Frolic! I'll be in here.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.669
This actually reminds me
of a pair of underwear I have.

10:28.753 --> 10:29.920
They're one of my favorites.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.549
-[Karamo] I bet it does, you nasty freak.
-[laughs]

10:33.799 --> 10:35.426
[Kevin] Be careful, it's kind of narrow.

10:35.509 --> 10:36.594
[Tan] Okay.

10:37.511 --> 10:40.473
Basements usually worry me a little bit,
but okay.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.851
-Oh, my.
-[Kevin] That's my closet.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.311
-[Tan] This is it?
-This is it, yes.

10:45.394 --> 10:49.315
Oh, my gosh. It's not actually a closet.
It's not even a clothing rack.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.067
It's a pipe!

10:51.776 --> 10:52.610
Oh, my.

10:52.693 --> 10:55.112
-This is what I wear to work.
-What are you doing for work?

10:55.196 --> 10:56.405
I'm a mortgage closer.

10:56.489 --> 11:01.035
And where I'm working,
we can dress business casual or casual.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.913
But this isn't business casual or casual.
This is activewear.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.165
I know, but I can get away with it,
though.

11:06.248 --> 11:08.250
I don't want you to just get away
with something.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.044
I want you to feel good in what you wear.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.338
I'm gonna shock you with
what I'm wearing for the wedding.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.631
-I wanna see it, please.
-Okay. Yes.

11:15.049 --> 11:18.511
Me and two of my brothers
are gonna be wearing that for the wedding.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.596
Did you choose this,
or did Haley choose this?

11:21.347 --> 11:24.016
I chose it, because whenever we do
anything as a family...

11:24.100 --> 11:25.434
-Yeah?
-Break out the kilt for it.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.644
I think the kilt's beautiful.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.938
What are you wearing on top?
Is it a jacket or something?

11:29.021 --> 11:30.523
I have this jacket that I'm gonna wear.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.109
The only time I usually wear this is
in the wintertime,

11:33.192 --> 11:35.152
-to funerals and stuff like that.
-Okay.

11:36.612 --> 11:37.488
Kev!

11:38.280 --> 11:41.659
[laughs] I know. It's way too big.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.286
I could fit in there with you.
You're drowning in it, and...

11:44.370 --> 11:46.539
-Come on in! Bring it in. [laughs]
-It's a bit warm for that.

11:46.622 --> 11:49.625
There's this common misconception,
when someone loses a bunch of weight,

11:49.709 --> 11:51.669
that if they wear super baggy clothes,

11:51.752 --> 11:53.629
that shows how much weight they've lost.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.132
You did all the work of losing the weight

11:56.215 --> 11:58.259
and then this puts it all back on.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.052
How do you want to feel on the wedding?

12:00.803 --> 12:02.221
-It's an important day for you, too.
-[sighs]

12:03.347 --> 12:07.351
I don't know. Basically more confident,
that I can hold my head up high,

12:07.435 --> 12:08.394
-and smiling.
-Yeah.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.479
And try not to cry
walking her down the aisle.

12:12.773 --> 12:15.401
[Bobby]
It's the kitchen. It's the living room.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.696
It's the... recliner room.

12:19.488 --> 12:20.614
That's what-- [laughs]

12:20.698 --> 12:23.659
I have not decorated anything
in this house, except for my recliners.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.454
-Maureen basically did everything else.
-Okay.

12:26.537 --> 12:29.290
What are you doing with your horsey?
Can I ride with you?

12:29.373 --> 12:30.750
Yeah, you can.

12:30.833 --> 12:31.709
Grow up!

12:31.792 --> 12:34.128
You're gonna break his Christmas stuff.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.922
How would you like this home
to function now for you?

12:37.006 --> 12:39.633
Because this is your home now.
It's not Maureen's. It's not Haley's.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.385
How is it gonna work for Kevin?

12:41.469 --> 12:43.679
I would like to brighten up this area,

12:43.763 --> 12:47.475
'cause, like, it's just dreary
and depressing.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.392
On the weekends,

12:48.476 --> 12:51.520
do you wanna have Haley
and her husband over

12:51.604 --> 12:53.731
to cook and, like, have dinner?

12:53.814 --> 12:56.484
If they're gonna cook for me,
hey, no problem. I would love that.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.985
I'm cooking for myself all week.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.113
[Antoni] What do you cook for yourself
whenever you're here solo?

13:01.197 --> 13:03.115
My goto is something in the crockpot.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.700
Chicken and broccoli.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.285
-So, you enjoy cooking?
-Yes, I do.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.204
Now I have to learn how
to just cook for one.

13:08.287 --> 13:12.249
Doing that with myself is probably one
of the hardest things.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.001
'Cause cooking's how I connect
with other people.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.544
I wanna cook for whoever.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.171
You wanna share it with somebody.

13:17.254 --> 13:18.339
At the end of the week,

13:18.422 --> 13:19.882
you're gonna be hosting
the rehearsal dinner

13:19.965 --> 13:21.675
-in your own backyard.
-Yes.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.302
-How many people?
-Forty people.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.972
My brother's making homemade
seven cheese macaroni and cheese.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.058
[laughing]

13:29.141 --> 13:30.935
-That's intense, yeah.
-I'm in charge of everything else.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.479
I have no idea what I'm gonna make,
but I will figure it out.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.564
-I'm gonna help you with that challenge.
-[laughs]

13:37.399 --> 13:40.152
[Karamo] At the end of this week,
your daughter's getting married.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.487
Are you ready for the first dance?

13:42.154 --> 13:42.988
No.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.657
-The father-daughter dance?
-[Kevin] No.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.283
-I don't know how to dance.
-Okay.

13:46.367 --> 13:50.788
But Haley, when she was in fifth grade,
she was in a ballroom competition,

13:51.247 --> 13:54.333
so instead of her leading me,
I had to learn to lead her.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.460
[Antoni] Aww. That's sweet.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.837
-[Jonathan] That's really cute.
-[Karamo] It is.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.296
[Antoni] Think about that excitement,

13:59.380 --> 14:01.715
-with all the other feelings going on.
-[all] Yes!

14:01.799 --> 14:03.300
So, this is your daughter's wedding.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.303
We are feeling good.
We are feeling happy.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.388
Yeah! Oh--

14:07.471 --> 14:08.514
-Yeah?
-Yes.

14:08.597 --> 14:09.515
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

14:09.598 --> 14:12.977
Because we are kicking
this wedding week off right.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.562
Yeah!

14:16.772 --> 14:20.568
<i>♪ I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up ♪</i>

14:20.651 --> 14:23.529
Ever since Kevin's divorce,
he's been stuck in limbo.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.197
He has not moved on in any way.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.075
He's still clearly dressing
for the body that he used to have.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.578
I need him to start to focus
on his future life.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.122
He really just struggles
with self-confidence,

14:33.205 --> 14:35.624
so I wanted Kevin to realize
there's a stronger look

14:35.708 --> 14:39.920
that could give him more confidence
to reveal the beautiful man he is.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.673
[Bobby]
He's done nothing but people-please.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.009
From his ex-wife to Haley,

14:45.092 --> 14:48.137
he's never done anything
to make that home for him,

14:48.220 --> 14:50.264
so this week, I wanna make this home

14:50.347 --> 14:51.765
all about Kevin.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.017
<i>♪ I'm not giving up... ♪</i>

14:53.142 --> 14:56.186
[Karamo] Kevin is afraid to let go because
he's scared of losing his daughter,

14:56.270 --> 15:00.357
but what he needs to realize is that
just because something changes

15:00.441 --> 15:01.442
doesn't mean it's gone.

15:03.193 --> 15:07.364
Making something special for someone
is such a beautiful act of love.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.617
I want him to surprise Haley

15:09.700 --> 15:11.911
with the perfect meal
for the rehearsal dinner.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.623
[rock music playing]

15:26.091 --> 15:28.135
[Tan] Welcome to our loft.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.846
Here you are, my dear.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.306
-Cheers to you.
-Cheers.

15:32.389 --> 15:33.265
And Haley.

15:34.475 --> 15:35.392
And to Haley.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.603
Speaking of Haley, she's wonderful.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.896
I know she's wonderful.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.899
It's just everything coming up
is just a lot to process.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.192
And I'm still processing. [laughs]

15:43.275 --> 15:46.111
-Well, we want to help you get there.
-Who can lift this up?

15:46.195 --> 15:47.363
[laughing]

15:47.446 --> 15:50.199
-Sorry.
-No, here's the thing.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.409
Your self-deprecating humor...

15:53.410 --> 15:54.495
I don't love.

15:55.204 --> 15:58.082
That isn't nice.
That's not a nice feeling for you.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.334
I wanna laugh with you,
but I don't laugh at your weight.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.754
I do that just to, I guess,
make light for myself.

16:03.837 --> 16:07.049
I know you do.
I don't want you to feel that way anymore.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.175
You're lovely.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.302
You've got a lovely personality.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.097
You are clearly a frickin' wonderful dad.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.140
Your daughter's great.
You've raised her well.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.225
She's getting married.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.768
Now, sir, it's your turn.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.563
Kevin wants to start afresh,
but he's not gonna be able to do that

16:21.647 --> 16:24.191
unless he starts
to show himself more respect,

16:24.274 --> 16:26.151
and that means no more self-deprecation

16:26.235 --> 16:29.446
and actually dress for the life
that he wants to have.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.282
So, J. Hilburn has sent you
a bunch of stuff.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.325
Oh, wow.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.953
Great shirting, some suiting,

16:36.036 --> 16:39.707
some more casual pieces
and appropriate trousers and shoes.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.083
So, your glasses,

16:41.166 --> 16:43.335
these dark frames are hiding your eyes.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.629
I wanted to get you a lighter frame
to show off your eyes,

16:45.713 --> 16:47.548
so just try them on, let's see.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.509
These are a little more fresh.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.011
I really do like them.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.888
Good. Once you've got the rest
of your look on, you'll really feel it.

16:54.972 --> 16:55.806
I'm positive.

16:55.889 --> 16:56.932
-I'm ready.
-Okay, great.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.311
Kev, come on out, I want you to see this.

17:01.395 --> 17:04.064
Okay, stand here for me.
We have a mirror for you.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.818
Oh, wow. I clean up good. [laughs]

17:07.901 --> 17:09.319
You sure do.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.488
This blazer is close
to fitting you perfectly.

17:11.572 --> 17:14.491
It actually highlights
just how much weight you've lost.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.828
Before, I would never have known it
with how massive that blazer was

17:17.911 --> 17:18.746
that you had.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.914
This blazer just needs a couple of tweaks,
and it's done.

17:21.457 --> 17:25.002
I don't think Kevin's felt this way
in a very long time.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.255
If I saw you out at a restaurant or a bar
with your friends,

17:28.338 --> 17:31.175
I'd be thinking, "I wonder if he's single.
He looks wonderful."

17:31.258 --> 17:32.926
[Kevin]
And would you come over and ask me out?

17:33.343 --> 17:36.138
I know I'd be let down,
but if I was an older lady,

17:36.221 --> 17:38.390
looking for a man, I'm sure I would.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.267
[woman] Hello.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.102
[Tan] Hi, Stephanie, how are you?

17:42.186 --> 17:43.437
Come on up for me, my love.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.938
Stephanie's from J. Hilburn,

17:45.022 --> 17:47.858
the company
that has made this product for you.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.485
-Thank you.
-[Stephanie] You're welcome.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.154
You guys have a very special surprise
for him,

17:52.237 --> 17:54.114
which is a suit

17:54.198 --> 17:55.991
for the rehearsal dinner

17:56.075 --> 17:57.701
for your daughter's wedding.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.995
Oh, my goodness.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.457
That is beautiful.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.043
There's a lot of pressure
on Kevin this week.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.544
This is his daughter's wedding.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.713
I want him to feel on top of the world.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.673
-Kevin, you ready?
-Yes, I'm ready.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.300
[Tan] Do you wanna come out for us?

18:13.383 --> 18:14.301
Okay, my dear.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.220
It's good, right?

18:16.303 --> 18:18.639
I feel like I'm gonna knock women dead
with this.

18:18.722 --> 18:19.723
-Good.
-You are.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.016
[Tan] Let's start with the shoulder.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.061
So, your shoulder seam should actually be
on your shoulder.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.145
On the shoulder.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.106
If it starts to pass your shoulder,
it's too big.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.191
We're gonna just clip it for now.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.194
Your sleeve should hit the palm
of your hand,

18:32.277 --> 18:36.782
and then this should be a third of an inch
shorter than that.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.618
[Kevin] I always thought that the sleeve
had to cover over the shirt.

18:39.701 --> 18:42.871
-[Stephanie] A little bit of cuff to show.
-[Kevin] Yeah. I never knew that.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.332
It looks more refined,
and it looks custom.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.626
[Kevin]
I feel confident with what I'm wearing,

18:47.709 --> 18:50.462
which is rare for me to have that.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.048
Yeah. Hi, K.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.133
You look gorgeous.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.801
Thanks. What about our friend Kev?

18:55.884 --> 18:59.388
Oh, my gosh, Kevin!
You can't get any more handsome.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.931
-How do you feel?
-Hot.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.683
[laughing]

19:02.766 --> 19:04.268
-Yeah.
-Go get changed, my love.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.769
Thank you, thank you so much.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.820
How was that?
That suit, it looked really good on you.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.948
That's a whole new Kevin
that's coming out.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.032
Yes!

19:19.116 --> 19:21.743
I think...
I think it's gonna be a great day.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.662
This is a joyous moment.

19:23.745 --> 19:26.623
-Your daughter is getting married.
-I know.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.334
But it's gonna be very hard for me
to give her away.

19:30.043 --> 19:35.549
And now, I have to actually get used
to now being alone.

19:36.091 --> 19:39.803
Do you know why you're afraid to be alone?

19:40.470 --> 19:44.391
When the divorce became finalized,
I thought I could move on,

19:44.516 --> 19:47.728
but I've had a hard time moving on.

19:47.811 --> 19:51.148
And Haley and I have got very, very close,

19:51.231 --> 19:53.942
and she is actually my rock right now.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.779
I wouldn't be who I am without her.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.490
I want you to understand something.
You're not alone.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.451
Think about when the divorce happened,

20:02.534 --> 20:04.411
your relationship evolved
into something new.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.205
That's the same thing with your daughter.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.498
-Do you see the parallel?
-Yeah, I do.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.042
I want you to think about this.

20:10.125 --> 20:14.004
Your relationships are evolving,
but you have to grow with them.

20:14.087 --> 20:14.963
Yeah.

20:15.631 --> 20:19.134
You have to be open
to all these new, amazing chapters

20:19.218 --> 20:21.428
in your life
that you weren't even expecting.

20:22.804 --> 20:26.183
-Hey! So I invited them here...
-Hi!

20:26.308 --> 20:28.769
...because you're nervous about
that first dance.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.146
[Kevin laughs] Oh, yeah, that thing! Yeah.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.690
And there's somebody else here
who you're gonna practice with.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.150
Ta-da!

20:35.234 --> 20:38.570
Hey, Dad! Hey, what's up? [laughs]

20:38.654 --> 20:39.988
Hi, baby.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.074
The father-daughter dance
is really important to him.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.076
This is our dance instructor.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.535
-Shana.
-I'm Kevin.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.038
So, I want to give him some skills
so that he feels confident

20:48.121 --> 20:49.998
in doing this dance with his daughter.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.292
[Shana]
We're gonna put father-daughter together.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.336
-You guys can do it too if you want.
-Thank you!

20:54.419 --> 20:55.837
[Shana] You have to choose
who's gonna lead and follow.

20:56.755 --> 20:57.923
[Tan] You can lead.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.216
-[Antoni] You can lead.
-[Tan] No, you lead.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.425
[laughing]

21:00.550 --> 21:01.802
Pay attention!

21:02.386 --> 21:04.888
[Shana]
Now we are gonna start with a box step.

21:04.972 --> 21:08.267
You can use it in many dances,
but it is the basic of your rumba.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.811
Dad, you start with your left foot.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.854
So step and side together.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.274
Oh! Feet together for me.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.278
-No, don't make that noise! Focus!
-[laughing]

21:20.320 --> 21:21.154
Sorry.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.823
[Shana] Now back on your right.

21:22.906 --> 21:23.865
There you go.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.617
And side and together.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.954
Do you see how it's the foot
on the outside of the box that's moving?

21:29.037 --> 21:30.956
-Very good.
-[Haley] Good job, Dad.

21:31.039 --> 21:33.375
-[Jonathan] Wow, wow, wow!
-[Shana] Now, let's take dance position.

21:33.458 --> 21:37.504
So, our rhythm is slow, quick, quick.

21:37.587 --> 21:39.673
Slow... Like this, watch me.

21:39.756 --> 21:41.758
Slow, quick, quick.

21:41.842 --> 21:42.676
Slow...

21:42.759 --> 21:43.677
Oh!

21:43.760 --> 21:45.595
Keep forgetting that last part.
I did it wrong.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.222
[Shana] You're fine.
Ready, step forward on the left foot.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.765
And this goes slow,

21:48.849 --> 21:50.642
quick, quick. Slow...

21:50.726 --> 21:52.311
[Bobby] Boop, beep. Boop, beep.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.813
[Jonathan] No, Bobbers, that's a triangle
that you're doing!

21:54.896 --> 21:56.606
How do I let her know which way I'm going?

21:56.690 --> 21:58.233
[Shana]
You can go whatever direction you want,

21:58.317 --> 21:59.985
as long as you use foot that's next.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.696
And be clear about your direction.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.948
-Put your hips into it, Bobby.
-Oh!

22:05.032 --> 22:07.326
[Shana] We go slow, quick, quick

22:07.409 --> 22:09.911
and slow, shoulder-width sidesteps for me,
so it's comfortable.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.371
And back on your right-- oh!

22:11.455 --> 22:12.414
Start over.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.665
And side together.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.083
And back together.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.711
You guys, very nice. Pretty good, yeah?

22:18.211 --> 22:19.629
[Antoni] Let's try some other moves.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.216
Yes! And then I just fall and you drag.

22:24.468 --> 22:28.221
-[Karamo] Yes!
-[laughing]

22:28.638 --> 22:31.683
You're having fun with the box steps,
which are really important.

22:31.767 --> 22:34.186
On Sunday, even if you mess up,

22:34.269 --> 22:36.188
it doesn't matter
because what is it about?

22:36.271 --> 22:39.024
-The connection between you two.
-Yeah, 'cause it's fun!

22:39.691 --> 22:41.109
[Karamo] Oh!

22:41.234 --> 22:43.403
-Good job!
-[laughing]

22:44.196 --> 22:45.864
[Karamo] Good job!

I'm gonna pop on that couch right there
and go to sleep.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.299
[laughing]

23:05.050 --> 23:09.096
I wanted to bring you in here
because I feel like this kind of fits

23:09.179 --> 23:10.597
for your lifestyle.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.557
-Like, it's still stylish, but comfortable
-Yes.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.850
and livable.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.103
I can tell you, I am not a stylish person.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.230
I never really worried about what I like.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.108
His opinions have always
just been based on

23:21.191 --> 23:23.819
what made everybody else around him happy.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.738
I wanna know what his opinions are,
to make him happy.

23:26.863 --> 23:29.825
-So, in your living room...
-Yes.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.701
..that big, massive sectional

23:31.785 --> 23:33.662
becomes that one big piece,

23:33.745 --> 23:34.871
just taking up everything.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.999
Yeah, and you're not able
to add a little bit more personality,

23:38.125 --> 23:41.378
so you're not able to add a nice armchair.
Take a seat.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.258
I need something a little bit higher,

23:46.341 --> 23:48.218
-because I have long legs. [laughs]
-Yeah.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.345
Your knees are up by your chest right now!

23:50.429 --> 23:51.930
Come on, Goldilocks,
let's go find a better one.

23:52.013 --> 23:55.392
I was thinking something like this,

23:55.475 --> 23:57.727
which is also a recliner.

23:57.811 --> 23:58.979
You probably like them.

23:59.062 --> 24:01.690
Yes, because I get to keep my legs up
off the ground.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.401
-Ooh.
-Yeah?

24:04.484 --> 24:05.402
-Oh, yeah.
-[laughs]

24:05.902 --> 24:08.447
[snores, laughs]

24:08.572 --> 24:09.614
I think we found it.

24:10.198 --> 24:11.658
In your kitchen right now,

24:11.741 --> 24:13.952
you've got that table all pressed up
into the corner.

24:14.035 --> 24:15.078
Yes, it's too big.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.414
In a smaller space, you need a round one.

24:17.497 --> 24:20.876
-A round one utilizes all sides.
-All sides.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.170
I was thinking about doing something
like this banquette.

24:23.253 --> 24:27.090
Yes. It would pop. [laughs]

24:27.215 --> 24:28.049
Let's keep looking.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.303
What about this one?

24:31.386 --> 24:32.220
[Kevin] I like that print.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.431
-We've got every shade of it right here.
-Yes, we do.

24:34.514 --> 24:35.390
[laughing]

24:35.474 --> 24:38.435
It's really cute to see Kevin absorbing
all this information like a sponge.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.103
[Kevin] Ooh, I like that.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.439
-It's soft, and it's got texture.
-Yep.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.025
I can tell he's really enjoying
having an opinion

24:45.108 --> 24:46.693
and realizing he has good ones.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.069
Bedding.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.070
[Kevin] I like that color.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.447
-[Bobby] The gray?
-That would look nice.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.157
[Bobby] You said you had no design style.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.825
I'm getting into that gray area.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.368
[laughing]

24:55.452 --> 25:00.332
<i>♪ It all starts right here ♪</i>

25:01.249 --> 25:03.543
<i>♪ Nothing to fear ♪</i>

25:04.669 --> 25:05.670
[Antoni] Do you know this place?

25:05.754 --> 25:08.006
-Fiore.
-I've walked past it a few times.

25:08.089 --> 25:10.133
-[Antoni] Okay. It is awesome.
-But I've never actually been in.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.259
[Antoni] Thank you.

25:11.635 --> 25:14.054
Kevin needs to plan
the perfect rehearsal dinner.

25:14.471 --> 25:17.224
I want him to be able to show up
for his daughter, entertain

25:17.307 --> 25:20.810
and really have a good time because this
day is really important for him as well.

25:21.102 --> 25:23.146
-I did a little intel.
-Uh-oh.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.023
-[laughs]
-So, you know who Tierra is?

25:25.106 --> 25:26.483
Yes, I know who Tierra is.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.401
I called Tierra, Haley's best friend.

25:28.485 --> 25:31.321
Apparently, Haley is low-key bougie.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.199
And she's been trying out
some new things differently.

25:34.282 --> 25:36.868
You're gonna surprise her
with one of her new favorite things.

25:36.952 --> 25:39.079
-Okay.
-Are you familiar with beef short ribs?

25:39.788 --> 25:40.622
[Kevin] Not really, no.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.165
Really? So, this is new?

25:42.249 --> 25:43.583
-Yes.
-Okay.

25:43.667 --> 25:47.170
This is sort of a slow-cooked dish
that we can make ahead of time,

25:47.254 --> 25:49.172
and it's something
that's just gonna stay warm

25:49.256 --> 25:50.173
with a crockpot.

25:50.257 --> 25:53.051
And it is gonna go so well
with your brother's mac 'n' cheese.

25:53.134 --> 25:57.931
Awesome. This is basically her day,
and I want to make it for her.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.140
Yes!

25:59.224 --> 26:02.477
Yes, he's doing this for Haley,
but he's also really doing it for himself

26:02.561 --> 26:05.480
because food can really help him connect
with other people.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.608
And, like,
it makes for a much less lonely life.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.777
The base for our braised short rib

26:10.860 --> 26:14.155
is gonna have the holy trinity of onions,
carrot and celery.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.784
We wanna have nice, thin, little strips.

26:17.867 --> 26:21.121
And you're gonna cut down like this,
so we have little cubes.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.415
Exactly.

26:23.498 --> 26:24.583
And I'm not crying.

26:24.666 --> 26:25.667
-Go figure.
-There you go.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.544
You have very good instincts.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.088
You're holding your fingers
exactly where you should be.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.507
-Do you ever cook with vegetables?
-Sometimes.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.718
You know, like, not too often.

26:34.801 --> 26:37.053
I think it's a nice little moment
with yourself,

26:37.137 --> 26:39.598
just to do something
that's kind of for you.

26:39.681 --> 26:42.517
You're gonna have a little more of that
with Haley being out of the house.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.852
Yes, I will.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.147
How are you feeling about all that?

26:47.981 --> 26:51.735
It's like I'm leading her
into her next chapter of her life.

26:52.944 --> 26:55.363
She's gonna go one way in her chapter,

26:55.447 --> 26:58.074
and I'm gonna go another way
in my chapter.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.159
Yeah.

26:59.993 --> 27:01.703
So, we're gonna let this heat up.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.247
Now, we have to flavor our beef short rib.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.542
Salt is gonna really helped tenderize it
and bring out all of that flavor.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.169
-[Kevin] So, it will fall off the bone.
-Exactly.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.838
Pan is plenty hot now,
so be careful when you put it in.

27:11.921 --> 27:13.632
[Kevin laughs] It smells good.

27:13.715 --> 27:16.926
Beef and salt and fat,
there are worse things to smell, right?

27:17.010 --> 27:18.637
-See that nice crust?
-That looks good.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.388
That's how we want every one to look.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.223
[Antoni] That's exactly how we want
every side to be.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.893
We have beautiful fat here.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.853
-Now we're ready for our vegetables.
-Okay.

27:28.021 --> 27:28.938
This is tomato paste.

27:29.022 --> 27:32.067
This is gonna add a nice acidity
and a nice base for it.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.237
Now we have some liquids
that we're gonna be adding.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.364
Red wine.

27:37.447 --> 27:38.573
-Cola.
-Really?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.450
So, that's gonna be our caramel portion.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.911
-You wanna smell this?
-[sniffs]

27:43.244 --> 27:45.246
-It smells like coffee.
-It's espresso.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.666
-Oh.
-That's gonna add nice bitterness to it.

27:48.500 --> 27:52.879
I'm actually just gonna add a little bit
of canned chipotles and adobo.

27:52.962 --> 27:54.172
These are very spicy.

27:54.255 --> 27:56.966
Now our short ribs in here like so.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.426
-[Kevin] All of them?
-All of them.

27:58.551 --> 28:01.179
Garlic. Let's use four.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.263
Oh, put all six in.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.640
-All six?
-All six.

28:03.723 --> 28:04.891
You know what? This is your dish.

28:04.974 --> 28:06.935
-Go big or go home!
-Go big or go home.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.812
I'm gonna put this in the oven.

28:09.354 --> 28:12.065
Set on 350 for about two,
two and a half hours.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.318
-That's why the crockpot comes in handy.
-Okay.

28:15.402 --> 28:18.279
It's gonna sit there and all the flavors
are gonna melt together

28:18.363 --> 28:20.156
into this beautiful braised short rib.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.491
That's awesome.

28:21.574 --> 28:24.411
My hope for Kevin is that
he doesn't linger too much

28:24.494 --> 28:26.246
on missing his daughter,

28:26.996 --> 28:31.000
but instead, gets excited about
what his life can evolve and turn into.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.044
Now we get to enjoy our creation.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.171
-Okay.
-That looks delicious.

28:37.507 --> 28:38.341
How's that?

28:38.425 --> 28:41.428
Oh, my God. These taste unbelievable.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.763
I think Haley's gonna be really impressed.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.099
I'm actually looking forward
to being able to...

28:46.433 --> 28:48.184
-make this for somebody someday.
-Aww.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.602
I eventually will.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.438
-That's my goal.
-Right.

28:51.521 --> 28:54.441
[laughs] Mm!

28:54.524 --> 28:56.526

29:05.577 --> 29:07.245
<i>♪ Yeah... ♪</i>

29:08.204 --> 29:11.291
I can tell that Kevin is a little worried

29:11.374 --> 29:14.627
about being in an empty nest,
being a bachelor, his daughter being gone.

29:14.711 --> 29:17.338
I really want to make sure
that I design this home

29:17.422 --> 29:19.215
for Kevin's new chapter

29:19.299 --> 29:22.469
so that he realizes this is actually
an exciting time in his life.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.971
-Is she working?
-[man] Well, let's try.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.642
Oh. Let's see.

29:30.143 --> 29:30.977
Wow!

29:40.987 --> 29:43.323
Isn't this cute? I love this part of town.

29:43.740 --> 29:44.574
Come on in.

29:44.657 --> 29:46.493
-Okay.
-She's very bustling.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.537
-[Kevin laughs] I like your shoes.
-Thank you!

29:49.621 --> 29:50.830
Take a seat.

29:51.206 --> 29:54.834
Okay. So, is this the typical shape
that you wear your hair as,

29:54.918 --> 29:58.087
kind of out of your face
and you do your little gel approach?

29:58.171 --> 30:00.048
Yes. I usually keep it really short.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.175
Don't have to worry about
doing anything to it.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.969
Kevin is in a monogamous relationship

30:05.053 --> 30:07.263
with hard, firmest hold gel.

30:07.347 --> 30:10.683
That is a monogamous relationship
that I can just not get behind.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.144
I think that the slick back
is a little severe.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.647
It's definitely a trick
you can pull out of your pocket,

30:15.730 --> 30:18.316
but we wanna have, like,
more than one way of wearing our hair.

30:18.399 --> 30:20.735
I want to do something
that's a little bit more classic.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.111
And then for your beard,

30:22.195 --> 30:25.281
I wonder what you'd look like
with a short little stubble.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.283
I don't know. It'll still be white.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.327
Yeah, but that's hot. I love that story.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.245
[laughs]

30:30.703 --> 30:32.038
-[Jonathan] We're doing it.
-Go for it.

30:32.121 --> 30:34.123
-"I want you to reveal my face."
-[laughs]

30:34.666 --> 30:37.710
[Jonathan] I love the color of this hair.
I think it's so handsome.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.796
But I look like I'm...

30:39.879 --> 30:43.800
Are you into, like,
ladies who are, like, 59?

30:44.259 --> 30:47.095
'Cause my mom's single,
and she's really cute.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.932
She's got curves and swerves.
She's gorgeous.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.518
Do you wanna be my stepdad?

30:53.643 --> 30:54.561
[laughs]

30:54.644 --> 30:55.603
Oh, my God!

30:55.687 --> 30:57.689
I want Kevin to date my mom!

31:00.358 --> 31:02.777
I feel like you are my clay,

31:02.861 --> 31:04.654
and I am Michelangelo.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.490
-[Kevin] That's a lot.
-Whoo.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.450
Come<i> conmigo, amigo.</i>

31:12.412 --> 31:14.873
We're doing stimulating shampoo
and conditioner on you,

31:14.956 --> 31:17.584
which is really good for people
that use heavy gel,

31:17.667 --> 31:20.545
'cause it'll help clarify any build-up.

31:21.087 --> 31:23.172
-Okay.
-Don't look in the mirror.

31:24.299 --> 31:27.093
If you could envisage yourself
a year from now,

31:27.677 --> 31:30.597
what would your hope for yourself be?

31:31.389 --> 31:34.058
Hopefully be ten pounds lighter. [laughs]

31:34.350 --> 31:35.226
And...

31:36.311 --> 31:39.981
hopefully being with somebody
that I care about and love.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.566
I think that could very well happen.

31:41.649 --> 31:42.901
But, like, here's the thing.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.819
You've been spending
all this time with your ex.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.071
You don't need to co-parent anymore
because guess what.

31:47.822 --> 31:49.240
-[Kevin] She's an adult.
-Yes, yes, yes, yes.

31:49.782 --> 31:51.659
You're gonna have to get out
and meet people.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.329
Make that a priority,
because you will have the time now.

31:54.621 --> 31:55.455
[Kevin] I'd like to.

31:55.538 --> 31:58.958
That would be kind of an amazing
new life for Kevin.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.168
[Jonathan] Yeah, for sure.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.379
For your hair, I love mousse

32:03.546 --> 32:06.674
'cause mousse will give your hair
a little bit of direction,

32:06.758 --> 32:08.301
just a little bit of texture.

32:09.302 --> 32:12.263
-You look really handsome, honey!
-[laughs]

32:12.347 --> 32:14.432
I'm glad to see I haven't lost my touch.

32:14.515 --> 32:17.185
Are you ready to see the new, gorgeous,
little baby Kevin?

32:17.268 --> 32:19.103
-Sure.
-The new you.

32:23.232 --> 32:24.692
Oh, my God. I didn't even--

32:25.026 --> 32:25.860
Where...

32:25.944 --> 32:27.236
Oh, my gosh.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.571
Who is that guy in the mirror?

32:28.655 --> 32:29.864
I love it.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.157
-Right?
-Yes.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.744
I actually like the stubble beard. It's...

32:34.869 --> 32:36.788
It's a little bit edgy and sexy
with the hair.

32:36.871 --> 32:38.665
Santa Claus has gone away! [laughs]

32:46.881 --> 32:48.383
[Jonathan] Good morning, gorgeous Kevin!

32:48.466 --> 32:50.885
-[Kevin] Good morning.
-Welcome to this stunning dental facility.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.261
After you, monsieur.

32:52.553 --> 32:54.263
Hi, guys.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.975
-Look at this handsome man.
-[man] So handsome.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.435
-Can you even handle?
-It's a big week. I can't handle.

32:59.519 --> 33:03.314
[Jonathan] Kevin has smile issues,
and it really affects his confidence.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.608
But now, we want Kevin to see himself

33:05.692 --> 33:08.695
as a proud-ass, gorgeous person.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.697
[Ben] All right! It's an exciting moment.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.408
So, is this essentially like
an adult flipper?

33:13.491 --> 33:14.951
[Ben] It's a partial denture.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.911
[Jonathan] A partial dench.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.830
[Kevin] Not a Judy Dench, a partial dench.

33:18.913 --> 33:21.082
-[Jonathan] Yes! There's the jokes.
-[Kevin] Right.

33:21.165 --> 33:22.458
[Jonathan]
Oh, my God, I can't wait to see.

33:22.542 --> 33:23.710
[Ben] Here we go.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.294
[Jonathan] Yes, Dr. Ben, we are coming in.

33:27.046 --> 33:28.589
Holy... [bleeps] that looks amazing.

33:28.673 --> 33:32.343
We are giving full smile realness here.

33:32.427 --> 33:35.388
-[laughs]
-[Ben] Now the bottoms. Bite together.

33:35.930 --> 33:38.224
-Kevin!
-[Kevin] They feel awesome.

33:38.307 --> 33:40.018
-They really do.
-It's a whole new you.

33:40.101 --> 33:42.562
So, come on in and say hello.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.231
[gasps] Oh, my gosh

33:45.314 --> 33:46.566
Oh, my gosh.

33:47.775 --> 33:50.903
[gasps] It's my smile. It's back.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.281
I love it. I love it.

33:56.075 --> 33:57.744
[sniffles] I love it.

33:57.827 --> 34:00.288
-Thank you, Doctor.
-I'm so happy for you, Kevin.

34:00.371 --> 34:01.330
-[Kevin] Thank you.
-Absolutely.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.207
[Kevin] Thank you. Thank you.

34:05.960 --> 34:09.172
Wow. [laughs]

34:09.255 --> 34:11.841
I can actually smile when I'm happy.
[laughs]

34:11.924 --> 34:14.010
Look at this gorgeous,
glowing father of the bride.

34:14.093 --> 34:16.012
-I can't wait till your daughter sees.
-Right?

34:16.095 --> 34:18.097

Look at this smile, how handsome he is.

-[Karamo] I wouldn't.

-Probably will.
-'Cause look! [gasps]

-Is this my house?
-[Karamo] This is your house.

35:16.656 --> 35:19.200
I'm sorry.
For once, I'm at a loss for words.

35:19.283 --> 35:20.868
Oh, my God, your teeth!

35:20.952 --> 35:23.955
They look so good! Oh, my God.

35:24.038 --> 35:25.790
Your smile!

35:25.873 --> 35:27.291
Okay, now we can see the house. Sorry. Go!

35:27.375 --> 35:28.292
[Karamo] Look at this house.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.545
-[Bobby] Notice how bright and light?
-Yes.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.963
[Bobby] Feels way bigger.

35:32.046 --> 35:33.923
[Kevin] Yeah, a lot bigger than it was.

35:34.006 --> 35:36.801
[Antoni]
And look how cute reclining chairs can be!

35:36.884 --> 35:38.553
This is the chair you picked out.

35:39.387 --> 35:40.763
-I love it.
-Nice.

35:41.097 --> 35:43.933
And since I used so many light colors
in here,

35:44.016 --> 35:46.018
I was able to do a dark color
in the dining room

35:46.102 --> 35:48.896
to define that area and make it feel
more intimate.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.982
[Kevin] Ooh, wow.

35:51.482 --> 35:53.067
Oh, my gosh.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.695
It's just amazing.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.532
Oh, my gosh.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.034
This is not my kitchen.

36:05.371 --> 36:08.249
[Bobby]
All new cabinets, all new countertops.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.252
[Kevin] I can actually see what's in
my cabinet without having to look for it.

36:11.335 --> 36:12.420
[gasps]

36:12.879 --> 36:15.715
[Jonathan] A breakfast nook!
Can you imagine?

36:15.798 --> 36:16.883
[Bobby] You love a good nook.

36:16.966 --> 36:18.050
[Antoni] Check this out.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.386
You know how we were touching our hands
with the beef

36:20.469 --> 36:23.097
and you have to wash your hands
when you're touching raw meat?

36:23.181 --> 36:26.309
Well, now you can just press
for the water to turn on.

36:26.392 --> 36:28.144
You can even hit your elbow with it

36:28.227 --> 36:30.396
-if you're filling something up.
-Oh, awesome.

36:30.479 --> 36:32.940
It's very good for cleanliness
and making sure you don't get bacteria

36:33.024 --> 36:34.567
or germs where you don't want them.

36:34.650 --> 36:38.112
Alexa, ask Delta faucet
to dispense one cup of water.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.113
<i>Okay.</i>

36:39.197 --> 36:40.698
-And then it turns on.
-Oh, my gosh.

36:40.781 --> 36:43.034
Oh, I was so thirsty. Thank you.
Oh, my gosh.

36:43.117 --> 36:44.619
[Antoni] Show us more, Bobby!

36:44.702 --> 36:47.371

-Oh, you can.

36:55.922 --> 36:57.298
I love it.

36:59.467 --> 37:02.094
I would never expect my bed to be there.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.513
This is the perfect little nook
for the bed.

37:04.597 --> 37:05.431
Yeah.

37:05.514 --> 37:07.266
Now you have easy access to your closet.

37:08.267 --> 37:10.519
Maureen, if you're in there,
you better come out!

37:10.603 --> 37:12.271
If you're up in there,
you better get out!

37:12.355 --> 37:14.106

-We changed the locks.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.151
[Tan] We're gonna try on clothes.

37:17.276 --> 37:18.736
-You go do your thing.
-All right.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.114
[Tan] I wanna talk
about the wedding looks.

37:23.115 --> 37:24.617
This is what you should be wearing

37:24.700 --> 37:27.411
-with a kilt.
-Oh, my God. No.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.372
Oh, no, you didn't.

37:29.455 --> 37:30.373
We did.

37:30.456 --> 37:32.041
You'll wear a white shirt with that.

37:32.124 --> 37:33.751
We've gotten you a bow tie as well.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.295
-It's gonna look a lot more sophisticated.
-I love this.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.755
[Tan]
Now I'd like you to try some things on

37:37.838 --> 37:40.466
so the boys can see how wonderful you look
in your new wardrobe.

37:41.050 --> 37:43.094
-Kevin Abernathy.
-Yes, sir.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.929
Will you join me, please, my love?

37:45.012 --> 37:46.013
[Kevin] I'd love to!

37:46.973 --> 37:49.100
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh!

37:49.183 --> 37:51.686
You're a handsome devil!

37:51.769 --> 37:53.187
[Karamo] These are different glasses.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.772
-[Tan] They're different glasses, yeah.
-[Karamo] Sexy.

37:54.855 --> 37:57.191
[Antoni]
That's the right pair of denim for you.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.402
-[Bobby] I like that color.
-[Tan] They're nice, right?

37:59.485 --> 38:00.736
How do you feel in it?

38:00.820 --> 38:02.238
-Comfortable.
-[Tan] Yeah.

38:02.321 --> 38:04.657
And may I say, sexy.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.659

-[Tan] You may.

38:06.742 --> 38:07.952
Do you know what a DILF is?

38:08.035 --> 38:10.746
Well, I know what a MILF is.
I guess it's a dude I'd love to...

-[Jonathan] No.
-...have fun with. [laughs]

38:13.124 --> 38:14.125
A dad.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.710
Oh, a dad, okay.

38:15.793 --> 38:16.794
[Tan] You're looking real dilfy.

38:16.877 --> 38:19.797
Coming from you guys, I take that
as very much of a compliment.

38:19.880 --> 38:20.715
Yeah!

38:20.798 --> 38:23.009
Take your jacket off for now
and come sit with us.

38:23.092 --> 38:24.427
Yes, confidence!

-Come on in.
-[Tan] Yeah, come join us.

38:26.262 --> 38:27.096
Yeah.

38:27.596 --> 38:31.058
You all have made me feel like
a brand-new Kevin.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.769
I was really scared

38:33.853 --> 38:36.230
when the week started,

38:36.314 --> 38:39.692
and I was kind of fearful of, like...

38:39.775 --> 38:40.693
fearful of change.

38:41.444 --> 38:43.863
But I'm gonna start my next chapter.

38:43.946 --> 38:47.908
of being better to myself, through myself.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.077
-Mm-hmm.
-And this way, if I'm better for myself,

38:50.161 --> 38:51.912
I can be better for someone else.

38:52.705 --> 38:55.541
Where you're evolving to
is a beautiful place,

38:55.624 --> 38:57.710
and that's the place you always need
to look towards.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.879
-[Kevin] I will take that with me.
-[Tan] Mm-hmm.

38:59.962 --> 39:02.256
And I thank you very much for that,
I really do.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.092
I am eternally grateful
to each and every one of you.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.469
I thank you so much.

39:06.552 --> 39:09.805
[Jonathan] We love you. You have
a gorgeous wedding to get excited for.

39:21.901 --> 39:22.818
Oh, my gosh. [laughs]

39:22.902 --> 39:26.238

for his relationships to evolve.

Still gonna be your best friend.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.366
Yes.

42:15.449 --> 42:18.536
You can still maintain
some sort of relationship,

42:18.619 --> 42:19.954
but it needed to evolve.

It's traditional. His family's Scottish.
He's embracing it.

-He looks so handsome!
-[Antoni] That's a great bow tie.

-Hi.

43:38.907 --> 43:42.453
He really looks fantastic,

43:42.536 --> 43:44.997
and it really isn't about
how you look on the outside.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.540
It's obviously about our energy

43:46.624 --> 43:48.500
-and how we feel, but...
-[Tan] It affects how we feel.

43:48.584 --> 43:51.712

carry himself differently, it's gorgeous.
