WEBVTT

01:12.338 --> 01:14.607
- I love you, Henry.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.445
- Mr. Dawles?

01:53.446 --> 01:54.646
- I'm Henry Dawles.

01:54.647 --> 01:57.015
- I'm an associate
of Mr. Remiel.

01:57.016 --> 02:00.053
Please, get in.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.578
Mr. Remiel's very appreciative

02:26.579 --> 02:28.814
of you coming on
such short notice.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.749
We do hope it wasn't

02:29.750 --> 02:30.949
too much of an inconvenience.

02:30.950 --> 02:33.685
- Oh, not at all.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.020
To be honest, I needed the work.

02:35.021 --> 02:37.289
It hasn't really
been easy to come by.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.824
- Ah.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.125
Well, then I hope
this is the first step

02:40.126 --> 02:43.128
toward reversing your fortune.

02:43.129 --> 02:44.363
- Yeah, me, too.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.732
My wife and I, we're
expecting a kid.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.934
- Congratulations, Mr. Dawles.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.169
- Thank you.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.137
- Is this your first?

02:52.138 --> 02:55.340
- Yes, it is.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.742
- Might I ask,

02:56.743 --> 02:58.544
boy or girl?

02:58.545 --> 03:00.045
- We actually don't know.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.046
- Ah.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.681
Another surprise.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.518
How delightful.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.489
Don't worry, Mr. Dawles.

03:10.490 --> 03:14.060
This bridge has
proven quite reliable.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.139
- We're sorry, your call

03:27.140 --> 03:28.840
did not go through.

03:28.841 --> 03:30.042
- I wouldn't fidget
with that too much,

03:30.043 --> 03:33.880
Mr. Dawles, service
out here can be scarce.

03:34.681 --> 03:36.248
- Great.

03:36.249 --> 03:37.950
My wife's gonna think
I left for good.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.952
- I'm sure she'll understand.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.620
- I don't think so.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.222
- Ah.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.190
Well,

03:45.191 --> 03:47.760
here we are.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.700
It's a beautiful
structure, isn't it?

04:28.701 --> 04:30.369
- Late 18th century?

04:30.370 --> 04:31.970
- Precisely.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.605
Word to the wise, Mr. Dawles,

04:33.606 --> 04:37.309
Mr. Remiel can be a
rather demanding soul.

04:37.310 --> 04:40.145
Just do ask he asks
and I promise you

04:40.146 --> 04:43.582
the compensation can
be quite generous.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.950
- Let me give you
a little something.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.552
- No need for
gratuity, Mr. Dawles.

04:47.553 --> 04:50.656
It's all been taken care of.

04:50.657 --> 04:51.990
- Thank you.

04:51.991 --> 04:53.892
When can we expect you back?

04:53.893 --> 04:55.160
- Hmm.

04:55.161 --> 04:58.898
Well, that is entirely
up to you, Mr. Dawles.

04:59.866 --> 05:02.267
Oh, uh, yes.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.536
Have a good stay.

05:04.537 --> 05:06.205
Hmm?

05:35.568 --> 05:37.336
- May I help you?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.004
- I'm Henry Dawles.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.206
Here to appraise the estate.

05:41.207 --> 05:43.141
- Mr. Remiel has
put you in the north

05:43.142 --> 05:47.346
end of the house,
overlooking the pond.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.981
Once you've settled,
you're to join him

05:49.982 --> 05:53.186
for a nightcap in the library.

06:05.498 --> 06:08.835
This will be your room.

06:11.170 --> 06:12.371
You'll find the bathroom at

06:12.372 --> 06:14.506
the far end of the hall.

06:14.507 --> 06:17.243
- It's wonderful, thank you.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.177
- It is widely believed

07:59.178 --> 08:03.449
that Bach died from
complications of eye surgery.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.818
An infection festered

08:06.819 --> 08:08.687
when a traveling
oculist attempted

08:08.688 --> 08:11.089
to remove cataracts

08:11.090 --> 08:13.525
from his eyes.

08:13.526 --> 08:16.828
The procedure failed mightily

08:16.829 --> 08:19.898
and within four months,

08:19.899 --> 08:22.868
Bach was dead.

08:22.869 --> 08:25.070
The greatest composer the world

08:25.071 --> 08:27.572
has ever known

08:27.573 --> 08:30.709
chose to fight his blind fate

08:30.710 --> 08:34.614
rather than accept it.

08:35.481 --> 08:39.885
Pride was his undoing.

08:39.885 --> 08:42.419
- I'm not proud, but I am happy

08:42.421 --> 08:43.922
and happiness blinds, I think,

08:43.923 --> 08:46.091
more than pride.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.826
- Alexandre Dumas.

08:47.827 --> 08:49.694
- The Count of Monte Cristo.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.162
My wife made me read it.

08:51.163 --> 08:52.697
- Smart woman.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.366
- You have no idea.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.234
- Mr. Dawles, I presume.

08:56.235 --> 08:58.870
- Please, call me Henry.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.171
- Come, Henry,

09:00.172 --> 09:02.541
join me by the fire.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.810
I hope your journey
wasn't too uncomfortable.

09:05.811 --> 09:07.979
- Oh no, not at all.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.447
- Would you care to join me for

09:09.448 --> 09:11.116
an evening spirit?

09:11.117 --> 09:14.020
- Yes, I would love to.

09:23.796 --> 09:26.332
Thank you.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.736
- Thank you, Mrs. Gates.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.205
Cheers.

09:34.206 --> 09:35.741
- Cheers.

09:43.349 --> 09:46.117
You've got a
beautiful home here.

09:46.118 --> 09:47.586
- Thank you.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.591
Sadly, I'm the last
of a dying breed.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.360
I fear once I'm gone,

09:55.361 --> 09:57.896
the estate will follow suit.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.931
- No family?

09:59.932 --> 10:04.270
- My late wife was
unable to bear children.

10:05.838 --> 10:09.541
Adoption was always
a conversation,

10:09.542 --> 10:12.444
rather than reality.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.513
- I apologize if I'm
overstepping my bounds,

10:15.514 --> 10:17.816
but without a
beneficiary, why bother

10:17.817 --> 10:20.318
with the appraisal?

10:20.319 --> 10:23.121
- Curiosity, I suppose.

10:23.122 --> 10:27.158
Even I don't know
everything about this place.

10:27.159 --> 10:29.694
Then again,

10:29.695 --> 10:32.864
maybe I just wanted the company.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.866
- Well then,

10:34.867 --> 10:37.636
to paid company.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.573
- To you, Henry.

10:44.010 --> 10:48.346
My old body is
begging for some rest.

10:48.347 --> 10:51.816
Feel free to look around
the place, if you like.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.119
I'll see you in the
morning for breakfast.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.787
Goodnight, Henry.

10:55.788 --> 10:58.257
- Goodnight.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.395
- Mr. Dawles.

14:57.396 --> 15:01.099
The attic is very
dangerous at night.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.969
May I suggest you
wait 'til morning?

15:04.970 --> 15:07.171
- Of course.

15:07.172 --> 15:10.943
- Good evening, Mr. Dawles.

16:42.701 --> 16:45.870
- Back there, about 300 yards,

16:45.871 --> 16:47.972
my mother built herself a little

16:47.973 --> 16:50.508
home away from home.

16:50.509 --> 16:54.813
We lovingly refer
to it as a madhouse.

16:55.647 --> 16:58.182
A small cottage where she could

16:58.183 --> 17:00.752
cool the daily agitations

17:00.753 --> 17:03.521
that my father presented her.

17:03.522 --> 17:07.325
You see, my father
was a drinker.

17:07.326 --> 17:09.694
My mother was a Methodist.

17:12.998 --> 17:15.733
- Well, my parents
divorced when I was 15.

17:15.733 --> 17:18.002
Maybe your mother
was on to something.

17:18.002 --> 17:20.137
- Maybe she was.

17:20.138 --> 17:22.574
Maybe she was.

17:25.444 --> 17:29.515
The house has been vacant
for over two decades.

17:30.315 --> 17:32.984
Due to my declining health,

17:32.985 --> 17:36.422
I haven't seen it
nearly that long.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.693
Would you mind
taking a few pictures

17:42.694 --> 17:45.263
to share with me
at dinner tonight?

17:45.264 --> 17:47.565
- Yeah, whatever you need.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.068
- Thank you.

17:50.069 --> 17:54.339
Holler if you need anything.

19:40.145 --> 19:41.513
- No way.

20:53.752 --> 20:54.752
Not bad.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.209
Holy shit!

22:37.155 --> 22:39.824
- I'm sad to say,

22:39.825 --> 22:41.459
he is not the first that we've

22:41.460 --> 22:45.196
dealt with over the years.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.399
Transients, drifters,

22:48.400 --> 22:51.569
even fugitives

22:51.570 --> 22:54.939
have sought asylum in our woods.

22:54.940 --> 22:57.241
Property this large

22:57.242 --> 23:00.979
lends itself to stowaways.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.982
Did you find anything
else on the body?

23:04.983 --> 23:07.752
Any sort of identification?

23:07.753 --> 23:10.121
- No, I didn't look.

23:10.122 --> 23:13.891
Legally, I shouldn't have
even touched the note.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.394
- What a sin.

23:16.395 --> 23:20.297
To give up on life so easily.

23:20.298 --> 23:23.300
- Well, we should
call the police.

23:23.301 --> 23:26.337
- I'll take care of
that, Mr. Dawles.

23:26.338 --> 23:29.206
I'll see that the body
is properly disposed of.

23:29.207 --> 23:31.809
- Disposed of?

23:31.810 --> 23:34.979
- Poor choice of words.

23:34.980 --> 23:38.850
A proper burial, of course.

23:40.252 --> 23:44.155
I do hope you'll stay
and finish the appraisal.

23:44.156 --> 23:47.892
I'm prepared to
offer you greater pay

23:47.893 --> 23:51.328
to compensate for
today's unpleasantries.

23:51.329 --> 23:55.332
- I don't think that
would be appropriate.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.601
- $5,000.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.771
On top of your fee.

24:00.772 --> 24:01.772
- That's a sizable offer.

24:01.773 --> 24:05.210
- $7,000.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.815
- Mr. Remiel, I
think you should find

24:10.816 --> 24:13.418
someone else.

24:15.921 --> 24:18.456
- Tell me, Mr. Dawles,

24:18.457 --> 24:22.793
just what will your
departure accomplish, hmm?

24:22.794 --> 24:26.964
An ethical victory?

24:26.965 --> 24:29.700
Moral triumph?

24:29.701 --> 24:31.101
Because it certainly won't help

24:31.102 --> 24:34.772
to take care of your wife.

24:34.773 --> 24:38.275
Or your unborn child.

24:38.276 --> 24:40.711
- How do you know
about my family?

24:40.712 --> 24:42.847
- My driver and I,

24:42.848 --> 24:45.516
we spoke.

24:45.517 --> 24:47.551
I understand this
job is very important

24:47.552 --> 24:50.287
to you, Mr. Dawles.

24:50.288 --> 24:52.289
- Yeah.

24:52.290 --> 24:54.692
It is.

24:54.693 --> 24:58.329
- I am offering you a
great deal of money.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.799
Enough to spoil
your growing family.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.034
Please,

25:04.035 --> 25:07.671
don't allow a fool's
poor judgement

25:07.672 --> 25:11.376
to determine yours.

25:12.844 --> 25:15.279
- $10,000.

25:15.280 --> 25:18.182
On top of my fee.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.286
- We have a deal.

25:24.923 --> 25:28.527
I do hope you enjoy lamb.

25:30.629 --> 25:31.996
- The madhouse definitely has

25:31.997 --> 25:33.597
some interesting stuff.

25:33.598 --> 25:36.701
Like that, for instance.

25:38.436 --> 25:40.471
- Yes.

25:40.472 --> 25:44.208
We named him Henry,
coincidentally.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.378
He was a gift to my mother.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.613
Brought back from China

25:49.614 --> 25:52.283
nearly 60 years ago.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.285
- Well, that's quite a gift.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.920
- My family has never been one

25:55.921 --> 25:58.522
for the obvious, Mr. Dawles.

25:58.523 --> 26:00.391
Can I take a look?

26:00.392 --> 26:03.394
That is beautiful.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.396
You have quite an eye.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.264
- I've had a lot of practice.

26:07.265 --> 26:08.866
- In what way?

26:08.867 --> 26:10.534
- I used to be a photographer.

26:10.535 --> 26:12.236
- Professionally?

26:12.237 --> 26:14.438
- Yep, for a number of years.

26:14.439 --> 26:15.973
I had my own studio

26:15.974 --> 26:18.509
in this broken down warehouse.

26:18.510 --> 26:20.444
I mean, we had brown water

26:20.445 --> 26:22.846
and the occasional rat, but

26:22.847 --> 26:25.516
I loved everything
about that place.

26:25.517 --> 26:28.419
- What changed?

26:28.420 --> 26:31.089
- It's a long story.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.629
- I have all the
time in the world.

26:41.199 --> 26:43.033
- One day, this
drop-dead brunette

26:43.034 --> 26:45.569
walked in my doors.

26:45.570 --> 26:47.471
She had these little
cut-off shorts,

26:47.472 --> 26:49.173
porcelain skin.

26:49.174 --> 26:50.174
Honestly, she was
the most beautiful

26:50.175 --> 26:52.309
thing I'd ever seen.

26:52.310 --> 26:54.411
She asked me if
I took head-shots.

26:54.412 --> 26:57.214
She wanted to be an
actress out in Hollywood.

26:57.215 --> 26:59.750
Now, I had never taken
a headshot in my life.

26:59.751 --> 27:01.085
But I lied right to her face and

27:01.086 --> 27:05.489
said with a smile,
of course I do.

27:05.490 --> 27:06.957
Tragically enough,
that young lady

27:06.958 --> 27:08.692
never did make it to Hollywood.

27:08.693 --> 27:10.494
- Oh?

27:10.495 --> 27:13.999
- Because I married
her three months later.

27:16.434 --> 27:19.069
About a year after the marriage,

27:19.070 --> 27:21.171
my business was failing.

27:21.172 --> 27:23.774
The market was diluted.

27:23.775 --> 27:25.376
My father-in-law had
thrown me a line,

27:25.377 --> 27:27.211
he offered me this gig.

27:27.212 --> 27:28.946
Steady pay, good benefits

27:28.947 --> 27:30.080
and we wanted to start a family,

27:30.081 --> 27:33.485
so I couldn't afford to say no.

27:35.353 --> 27:37.521
Closed the studio, sold
all of my equipment

27:37.522 --> 27:41.326
and that's that.

27:45.463 --> 27:50.034
- How easily we betray
the things we love.

27:50.035 --> 27:52.202
- Yeah.

27:52.203 --> 27:55.272
- That's enough
reminiscing for one night.

27:55.273 --> 27:59.443
Now try to get some
rest, Mr. Dawles.

27:59.444 --> 28:01.478
I have something
special to show you

28:01.479 --> 28:03.480
in the morning.

28:03.481 --> 28:06.618
- Looking forward to it.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.820
- Have a good night, Henry.

28:09.821 --> 28:11.923
- You, too.

28:51.863 --> 28:53.497
- We're sorry, your call

28:53.498 --> 28:55.734
did not go through.

29:04.442 --> 29:05.909
- We're sorry, your call

29:05.910 --> 29:08.113
did not go through.

30:35.867 --> 30:38.169
- Ahh, shit.

31:33.291 --> 31:36.260
- Good morning.

31:36.261 --> 31:38.028
- Coffee.

31:38.029 --> 31:39.296
- Thanks.

31:39.297 --> 31:42.332
Big tray for a little cup.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.401
- May I get you anything else?

31:44.402 --> 31:47.171
- No, ma'am.

32:05.556 --> 32:09.594
- Something on your mind?

32:10.862 --> 32:13.163
- You got any horses
in that stable?

32:13.164 --> 32:14.765
- Not for many years.

32:14.766 --> 32:17.434
I never took much to them.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.603
And in return,

32:19.604 --> 32:22.506
they never took much to me.

32:22.507 --> 32:24.608
Shall we?

32:24.609 --> 32:29.112
This farm has been in our
family for generations.

32:29.113 --> 32:33.517
Centuries of history
under our very feet.

32:33.518 --> 32:38.589
At one time, the main
house was an inn.

32:39.390 --> 32:40.657
A bed and breakfast of sorts for

32:40.658 --> 32:45.295
travelers heading north
into the mountains.

32:45.296 --> 32:48.465
Many nights, I've
imagined all the souls

32:48.466 --> 32:51.335
that must have
passed through here.

32:51.336 --> 32:55.807
Each with their
own story to tell.

32:57.842 --> 33:00.979
Ah, here we are.

33:34.679 --> 33:37.849
- We've been looking for you.

33:43.955 --> 33:46.456
- Tell me that their beauty

33:46.457 --> 33:49.493
isn't absolutely undeniable.

33:49.494 --> 33:51.595
- These are incredible.

33:51.596 --> 33:53.964
- Each and every piece

33:53.965 --> 33:57.701
machined from scratch.

33:57.702 --> 34:02.105
10,000 hours to create.

34:02.106 --> 34:03.441
- Did you build these?

34:04.275 --> 34:05.942
- Oh, no.

34:05.943 --> 34:08.712
I'm not nearly patient enough.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.681
'Twas my father who made them.

34:11.681 --> 34:12.483
- Amazing.

34:12.484 --> 34:13.516
Do they still run?

34:13.518 --> 34:14.951
- Of course.

34:14.952 --> 34:16.152
Though I wouldn't dare venture

34:16.154 --> 34:19.690
them out on that
old track out there.

34:20.491 --> 34:22.826
I can't help but feel

34:22.827 --> 34:25.295
that the majority of people take

34:25.295 --> 34:28.598
the world's beauty for granted.

34:28.599 --> 34:32.668
It's time spent incepting,

34:32.670 --> 34:37.074
designing, creating

34:37.074 --> 34:40.744
all that is.

34:40.745 --> 34:45.514
These objects in space.

34:45.516 --> 34:48.018
Needless to say, I feel it is my

34:48.018 --> 34:51.321
God-fearing responsibility

34:51.322 --> 34:53.889
to preserve that beauty

34:53.891 --> 34:57.461
and, when need be,

34:57.462 --> 35:00.797
give it a little polish
from time to time.

35:00.798 --> 35:02.299
- These are works
of art, Mr. Remiel,

35:02.300 --> 35:04.768
there's no question about it.

35:04.769 --> 35:05.802
But I'll be honest,
when it comes

35:05.803 --> 35:07.904
to their worth,

35:07.905 --> 35:10.006
I don't even know
where I'd start.

35:10.007 --> 35:12.943
- That's easy, Henry.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.712
They're priceless.

35:15.713 --> 35:17.347
- Yeah.

35:17.348 --> 35:19.116
- Through there,
you'll find a staircase

35:19.117 --> 35:22.452
on your left leading
to the storage garage.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.621
Between that and
the machine shop,

35:24.622 --> 35:29.093
you should find plenty
of work to fill your day.

38:23.334 --> 38:25.436
- Henry.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.986
- Hello?

43:42.519 --> 43:44.355
- Oh, shit!

45:25.189 --> 45:28.058
- What's wrong?

47:23.807 --> 47:26.176
- Run.

47:39.656 --> 47:41.592
Ugh.

47:49.700 --> 47:53.202
- Mr. Dawles.

47:53.203 --> 47:56.572
A word.

47:56.573 --> 47:58.808
- Who the hell was that?

47:58.809 --> 48:00.743
- You need to calm down, Mr.

48:00.744 --> 48:02.945
- Don't you tell
me to calm down!

48:02.946 --> 48:04.580
Do you see that?

48:04.581 --> 48:08.017
I was attacked on your
property, understand?

48:08.018 --> 48:12.256
- Are you threatening me?

48:14.258 --> 48:18.728
- I need to know what's
going on right now.

48:18.729 --> 48:21.130
- You're in shock, Henry.

48:21.131 --> 48:24.166
You have suffered a
sharp blow to your head

48:24.167 --> 48:27.336
and I suspect are
victim to a concussion.

48:27.337 --> 48:29.472
- You didn't answer me.

48:29.473 --> 48:33.142
- Take a moment, Mr. Dawles.

48:33.143 --> 48:35.745
Calm your nerves.

48:35.746 --> 48:38.180
And when you have done so,

48:38.181 --> 48:39.982
meet me in the kitchen

48:39.983 --> 48:44.487
for a civilized conversation.

48:44.488 --> 48:46.756
In the meantime, I
shall fetch Mrs. Gates

48:46.757 --> 48:50.193
to tend to your wound.

49:03.674 --> 49:05.641
You have taken liberties with my

49:05.642 --> 49:08.844
hospitality, Mr. Dawles.

49:08.845 --> 49:10.713
- There is something
in that barn.

49:10.714 --> 49:13.716
- A rail thin creature

49:13.717 --> 49:17.086
ravaging an unlucky hen.

49:17.087 --> 49:18.721
Is that correct?

49:18.722 --> 49:20.623
- You saw what was
left of that bird.

49:20.624 --> 49:23.159
- What I saw was
the rotten remains

49:23.160 --> 49:25.761
of an escaped farm animal.

49:25.762 --> 49:29.031
Nothing more.

49:29.032 --> 49:31.734
- I'm telling you the truth.

49:31.735 --> 49:34.870
- See it through my eyes.

49:34.871 --> 49:39.943
I find you in the stable, alone,

49:41.044 --> 49:44.347
your head bleeding and
your camera smashed,

49:44.348 --> 49:47.917
an empty glass of
bourbon on the porch.

49:47.918 --> 49:51.854
Can you at least
appreciate my perspective?

49:51.855 --> 49:54.724
- I understand how it must look.

49:54.725 --> 49:58.695
- What's really troubling
you, Mr. Dawles?

49:59.830 --> 50:02.365
It's in your eyes.

50:02.366 --> 50:05.634
Something deeper.

50:05.635 --> 50:08.671
Something personal.

50:08.672 --> 50:11.907
- I'm just trying to do
my job and that's it.

50:11.908 --> 50:15.745
- You are here to
perform a service, Henry.

50:15.746 --> 50:19.982
One that means a
great deal to me.

50:19.983 --> 50:23.353
Can I count on you?

50:24.955 --> 50:26.922
- Yeah.

50:26.923 --> 50:28.424
- Good.

50:28.425 --> 50:31.861
I had faith you'd
muster the will.

50:31.862 --> 50:33.896
Besides,

50:33.897 --> 50:37.734
I am growing quite
fond of your company.

50:38.568 --> 50:40.536
Get a good night's rest.

50:40.537 --> 50:43.640
I'll see you in the morning.

53:30.407 --> 53:33.375
Â™Ş Will the circle

53:33.376 --> 53:37.046
â™Ş Be unbroken

53:37.047 --> 53:39.448
â™Ş By and by

53:39.449 --> 53:42.986
â™Ş Lord, by and by

53:44.087 --> 53:47.122
â™Ş There's a better

53:47.123 --> 53:50.593
â™Ş Home a'waitin'

53:50.594 --> 53:55.599
â™Ş In the sky, Lord, in the sky

53:57.701 --> 54:00.769
â™Ş Will the circle

54:00.770 --> 54:04.373
â™Ş Be unbroken

54:04.374 --> 54:08.077
â™Ş By and by, Lord

54:08.078 --> 54:11.447
â™Ş By and by

54:11.448 --> 54:15.050
â™Ş There's a better

54:15.051 --> 54:18.320
â™Ş Home a'waiting

54:18.321 --> 54:23.326
â™Ş In the sky, Lord, in the sky â™Ş

54:31.835 --> 54:35.271
- Salena?

54:35.272 --> 54:39.009
You can't be here.

54:42.679 --> 54:43.979
My wife.

54:43.980 --> 54:46.983
Please.

55:18.114 --> 55:22.085
No, I am not doing this.

56:28.284 --> 56:31.754
- May I?

56:31.755 --> 56:34.456
- I don't know what's
happening here.

56:34.457 --> 56:37.259
- I'm not sure I
know what you mean.

56:37.260 --> 56:41.563
- You're telling me you
don't feel something

56:41.564 --> 56:45.267
evil?

56:45.268 --> 56:48.804
Nothing?

56:48.805 --> 56:53.075
- I was raised in a house
of refuge, Mr. Dawles.

56:53.076 --> 56:57.246
A reform school
for teenage girls.

56:57.247 --> 57:01.049
By societal standards,
we were classified as

57:01.050 --> 57:04.520
undesirable.

57:04.521 --> 57:08.223
But to the sexual
appetites of deep-pocketed

57:08.224 --> 57:12.194
men, we were quite the opposite.

57:12.195 --> 57:14.930
And when we matured and lost our

57:14.931 --> 57:19.669
childlike appeal, we
became something else.

57:23.106 --> 57:26.810
Disposable.

57:30.580 --> 57:32.448
To answer your
question, Mr. Dawles,

57:32.449 --> 57:37.220
I have felt evil many times.

57:38.054 --> 57:41.758
But never in this place.

58:46.456 --> 58:48.725
- Hello?

59:42.178 --> 59:44.948
Mr. Remiel?

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:23.486
Who are you?

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:27.790
- I'm you.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.905
Oh, shit.

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:11.767
- Henry?

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:15.538
Henry, is that you?

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:20.108
- Hi, Rebecca.

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:22.377
- Where have you been?

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:23.845
I was so worried.

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:26.481
- I'm working.

01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:29.051
- I've been calling you.

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:32.120
- There's no service here.

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:35.090
- You sound tired.

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:38.127
- I am.

01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:43.433
- Are you with her?

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:56.712
- I have to go.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:59.215
- I love you, Henry.

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:45.287
- You overslept, Mr. Dawles.

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:48.089
- I wasn't feeling
well, I'm sorry.

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:50.125
- Are you leaving us?

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:52.260
- My wife needs me home.

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:53.795
- Is that all?

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:55.497
- I need to be home.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:58.700
- I thought we had
a deal, Mr. Dawles.

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.068
- Well, you can keep the money.

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:04.407
- Let us amend our agreement.

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:10.213
I detest ending on poor terms.

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:14.282
It is clear that
you are headstrong

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:16.751
in your decision, but my driver

01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:20.121
will not be available
until morning.

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:22.891
So here is my compromise.

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:26.061
If you will work
through the night

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:29.531
to make up for your
daytime repose,

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:33.869
I will see that you
are fully compensated.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.204
- I appreciate the
offer, Mr. Remiel,

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:38.440
I really do,

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:41.943
but I can't finish
this job in one night.

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:45.580
- That's quite all
right, Mr. Dawles.

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:48.885
There will always be others.

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.771
- One more night.

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.406
Full pay.

01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:14.576
And I leave at dawn.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:17.879
- That's
fine, Mr. Dawles.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.981
You'll find the
barn a quarter mile

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:22.817
south of the main house,

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:26.122
just past an old fishing pond.

01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:30.986
I'm sorry, Jesus.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:32.754
I didn't want to hurt her.

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:34.957
- Hello?

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:48.003
It's hers, not mine.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:50.338
I promise I'll be good.

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:52.908
- Hello?

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:02.151
Please, Jesus.

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:11.427
I just want to go home.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.008
- Oh!

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:43.525
I'm Henry.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:46.595
What's your name?

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:05.681
Why are you praying?

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:13.689
Is someone out there?

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:25.767
- Stop!

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:27.234
- No, no, no.

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:30.673
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

01:08:32.073 --> 01:08:35.478
Will you take that off?

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:39.714
Please?

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:42.484
I just want to talk to you.

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:49.390
Can I take it off?

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.707
Ah, oh!

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:20.421
Who did that to you?

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:25.292
We need to get you out of here.

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:27.196
We gotta get you some help.

01:09:33.234 --> 01:09:36.337
Hey, where'd you go?

01:09:36.337 --> 01:09:38.474
Hey!

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:42.711
Oh, goddamnit.

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:34.997
What the hell was that?

01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:51.714
Oh, shit.

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:53.341
- Ah, you've awakened.

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:54.776
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:55.577
Okay, my friend.

01:11:55.578 --> 01:11:56.644
- Who the hell are you?

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:59.347
- My name is Ahmad.

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:01.482
I found you unconscious
near the woods.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:02.717
I hope you don't mind,
I took the liberty

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:06.054
of cleaning your wounds.

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:08.122
- How'd you get out here?

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:12.094
- I may ask you the same
question, my friend.

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:18.534
- You're a fugitive.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.635
- Ah.

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:23.271
I thought I had escaped.

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:25.873
But I am far from free.

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:28.142
- What did you do?

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:32.213
- I took what is not mine.

01:12:32.214 --> 01:12:33.648
I bring you no harm.

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:36.785
Please, sit.

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:43.525
Are you hungry?

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:55.636
Take it easy, my friend.

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:57.071
The meat is rich.

01:12:57.072 --> 01:13:00.309
You'll make yourself ill
if you eat too quick.

01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:04.746
- Thank you for this.

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:07.215
- The pleasure's mine.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.183
I must confess,

01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:12.520
I haven't shared a
meal in many days.

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:15.556
And I fear the solitude
breeds madness.

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:16.691
- Well I suspect if
you were gonna kill me,

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:18.893
you wouldn't feed me first.

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:19.862
- Well, that would depend on

01:13:19.863 --> 01:13:22.931
the degree of my madness.

01:13:26.368 --> 01:13:29.872
I'm just messing
with you, my friend.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.247
- So where you from?

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:43.317
You hear those?

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:45.186
- How could I not?

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:47.722
- I've been hearing things.

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:48.890
I've been seeing
all kinds of things

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:50.658
that don't make sense.

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:54.061
- I fear these things
are quite real.

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:56.297
They accompany my day

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:59.066
and my nightmares as I sleep.

01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:00.868
- Yeah, what the hell are they?

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:02.103
- I do not know.

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:05.773
But the fire seems to
keep them at a distance.

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:09.043
In my religion, when
you're very young,

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:11.779
we are taught of the djinn.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:14.282
Are you familiar with this term?

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:15.883
- Only the liquor.

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:17.418
- I am Muslim.

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:19.454
Not the liquor.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:23.458
The djinn are dark
beings created by Allah.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.660
- You're talking about demons.

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:27.261
- Not demons.

01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:30.231
But not human, either.

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:32.533
They are depraved creatures

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:34.569
caught between worlds.

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:37.104
Living in the shadows,
forever wandering,

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:41.042
until their day of judgement.

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:43.878
- Maybe you have been
out here too long.

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:46.914
- Well, that may be.

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:50.985
But then I must ask you
a question, my friend.

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.454
Do you have a better theory?

01:14:54.122 --> 01:14:55.957
Stay close, my friend.

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.058
As the darkness grows,

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:59.694
so too does their impatience.

01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:02.964
I plan to move at first light.

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:06.702
Will you join me?

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:16.277
- Let's get the
hell out of here.

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:17.778
- I'll be quick, my friend.

01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:20.181
Until then, you keep
the flames bright.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:22.451
- Yeah.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:48.270
- What are you doing?

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:49.604
- Don't move!

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:51.072
Please,

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:51.974
don't move.

01:16:51.975 --> 01:16:52.975
- What are you doing?

01:16:52.976 --> 01:16:55.142
- I know you.

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:56.477
You've been here before.

01:16:56.478 --> 01:16:58.346
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:16:58.347 --> 01:16:59.780
- They didn't follow you here.

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:01.849
You led them to me.

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:02.917
You're one of them.

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:04.518
- One of who?

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:05.387
- The djinn.

01:17:05.388 --> 01:17:07.656
- That's insane

01:17:09.024 --> 01:17:11.426
- They're here.

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:32.980
If it is my time, I
will take you with me.

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:35.883
I swear to you.

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:39.520
- I"m not one of them.

01:17:39.521 --> 01:17:42.591
You fed me.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:46.560
You treated my wounds.

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:48.562
I'm human, flesh and
blood, just like you.

01:17:48.563 --> 01:17:49.664
- Don't lie to me!

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:50.432
- I'm not.

01:17:50.433 --> 01:17:52.267
You heard me.

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:56.504
I'm your friend.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.240
Ahmad, please.

01:17:59.107 --> 01:18:02.376
Ahmad, please.

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:05.546
Please.

01:18:05.547 --> 01:18:08.483
Ahmad, please.

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.226
- I'm sorry.

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:20.661
I'm sorry.

01:18:20.662 --> 01:18:22.597
I'm so sorry.

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:30.872
We must run.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:30.432
- What are you doing?

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:37.605
Ahmad!

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.273
Ahmad, what's going on?

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:40.908
Hey, what's happening?

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:41.909
Ahmad, what are you doing?

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:42.744
We gotta get out of here.

01:19:42.745 --> 01:19:43.945
We gotta go now!

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:47.815
- Go on!

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:49.383
- No, goddamnit, I'm
taking you with me.

01:19:49.384 --> 01:19:50.318
Come on!

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:51.652
Come on, get up.

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:52.787
- Get out of here.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:53.921
- Come on!

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:55.756
- Go alone, my friend.

01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:58.760
Now!

01:23:33.508 --> 01:23:36.111
- Remiel!

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:08.910
I am done with your bullshit!

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:06.533
I found that body
you disposed of!

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:08.602
And Mrs. Gates.

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:11.973
You son of a bitch!

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:19.948
Goddamnit, Remiel, you face me!

01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:27.347
- Of all the music of man,

01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:32.320
this is undeniably
the most sorrowful.

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:39.160
Don't you agree?

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:46.033
I apologize for that.

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:50.638
It was purely self
defense, I assure you.

01:26:51.406 --> 01:26:53.041
- Is this hell?

01:26:55.476 --> 01:26:57.744
- Oh no, Mr. Dawles.

01:26:57.745 --> 01:27:00.747
This most certainly is not.

01:27:00.748 --> 01:27:02.749
- Why did you kill Mrs. Gates?

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:04.418
- Kill?

01:27:04.419 --> 01:27:09.056
For shame, Mr. Dawles,
I am no murderer.

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:10.657
She has been freed.

01:27:10.658 --> 01:27:13.161
- She's dead!

01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:28.942
- That

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:30.744
was rude,

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:34.048
Mr. Dawles.

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:41.288
- Why am I here?

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:44.726
- To appraise the
estate, of course.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.363
- Bullshit.

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:52.833
- You have a
visitor, Mr. Dawles.

01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:54.668
- A visitor?

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:56.303
- What is it about
visitor that you

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:59.806
don't understand?

01:27:59.807 --> 01:28:01.675
- Who?

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:04.712
- See for yourself.

01:28:54.896 --> 01:28:58.132
- Rebecca?

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:07.140
How did you get here?

01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:10.545
- Same way you did.

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:15.817
- I don't understand.

01:29:20.722 --> 01:29:22.155
We need to leave, Rebecca,

01:29:22.156 --> 01:29:25.460
we have to go right now.

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:32.165
- How was she?

01:29:32.166 --> 01:29:35.469
- Who?

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:38.840
- Lying only makes
it hurt more, Henry.

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.881
- Oh, no.

01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:51.118
Oh, shit.

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:53.020
Oh.

01:29:56.924 --> 01:29:59.860
Oh, Rebecca.

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:02.195
Rebecca, what happened?

01:30:02.196 --> 01:30:05.532
- I knew from the beginning

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:07.334
and I tried to convince myself

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:11.204
that you wouldn't do that to me.

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:14.274
To us.

01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:18.178
To our baby girl.

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:21.382
I held it all in.

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:26.887
The pain and the heartbreak.

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:31.225
I thought I'd been strong.

01:30:32.326 --> 01:30:36.497
But I wasn't strong
enough for both of us.

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:39.666
- What are you doing?

01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:41.768
Rebecca, put down the gun.

01:30:41.769 --> 01:30:45.673
- She died inside me, Henry.

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:48.308
I was pregnant
with our dead child

01:30:48.309 --> 01:30:49.576
while you were
out there sleeping

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:52.746
with that woman.

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:55.982
That whore!

01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:59.654
- Rebecca, please.

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:05.593
- I loved you.

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:09.763
I loved her.

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:12.365
- I do love you.

01:31:12.366 --> 01:31:14.167
Ever since the first
time I saw you,

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:16.837
I've always loved you.

01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:20.907
- You brought her
into our home, Henry.

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:23.743
Into our bedroom.

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:25.545
In our bed!

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:27.113
- I know.

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:30.083
It was a mistake, it
was a horrible mistake.

01:31:30.084 --> 01:31:33.820
And I ended it.

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:35.789
- It's over?

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:37.858
- Yeah, it's over.

01:31:37.859 --> 01:31:41.062
I swear.

01:31:42.129 --> 01:31:45.131
That's right, baby,
just put down that gun.

01:31:45.132 --> 01:31:49.270
We need to get you
to a hospital, okay?

01:31:52.373 --> 01:31:57.445
- Love is the true seed
of every virtue in you.

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:02.683
And for all acts for
which you must atone.

01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:10.650
- No.

01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:12.286
- I love you, Henry

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:48.855
- I'm sorry,

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:52.493
I'm so sorry.

01:34:34.802 --> 01:34:37.937
- Many nights I've
imagined all the souls

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:40.740
that must have
passed through here.

01:34:40.741 --> 01:34:43.843
Each with their
own story to tell.

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.412
- They're depraved creatures

01:34:45.413 --> 01:34:47.280
caught between worlds.

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:49.683
Living in the shadow,
forever wandering,

01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:52.285
'til the day of judgement.

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:55.488
- But I can't finish
this job in one night.

01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:58.291
- That's quite all
right, Mr. Dawles.

01:34:58.292 --> 01:35:00.126
There will always be others.

01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:02.262
- Rebecca?

01:35:02.263 --> 01:35:05.598
How did you get up here?

01:35:05.599 --> 01:35:09.603
- The same way you did.

01:35:39.033 --> 01:35:42.368
- Are we dead?

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:46.674
- Yes, Henry.

01:35:49.844 --> 01:35:53.913
- I'm sorry.

01:35:53.914 --> 01:35:57.952
I never meant to hurt you.

01:36:00.254 --> 01:36:03.590
I was lonely.

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:08.596
And I was weak.

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:13.566
I'm so sorry.

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:16.035
- You broke my heart.

01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:18.905
But I put us here.

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:21.007
- What can I do?

01:36:21.008 --> 01:36:24.043
- You must repent.

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:27.747
Just as I will.

01:36:27.748 --> 01:36:31.151
- How?

01:36:31.152 --> 01:36:34.355
- He's waiting for you.

01:36:43.798 --> 01:36:48.869
- So good of you to
join me, Mr. Dawles.

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:51.371
- What is this place?

01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:55.074
- And so he created a
place of purification.

01:36:55.075 --> 01:36:58.511
A land of provisional torment

01:36:58.512 --> 01:37:03.584
for those who are
not yet worthy.

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:09.190
A place where the
glutton shall starve,

01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:15.930
where the envious
shall be blinded,

01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:20.868
where the slothful
shall never rest,

01:37:21.869 --> 01:37:26.606
where the prideful shall serve,

01:37:26.607 --> 01:37:31.679
where the greedy
shall be chained,

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:35.883
where the wrathful shall mourn,

01:37:37.218 --> 01:37:42.022
and where the
lustful shall burn.

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:46.125
I'm proud of you, Mr. Dawles.

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:50.196
You are doing far
better than ever before.

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:52.532
- What do you mean before?

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:55.068
- Don't you remember?

01:37:55.069 --> 01:37:57.503
You have failed

01:37:57.504 --> 01:38:00.975
many times.

01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:06.546
- So what are you?

01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:09.449
- Isn't that entirely clear?

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:12.819
I am the overseer of this land

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:15.722
and the guardian of the process.

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:19.259
My role is quite simple,

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:23.830
to purify.

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:25.665
- What do I have to do?

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:30.169
- The flames will
judge the lustful soul.

01:38:30.170 --> 01:38:32.205
And if it proves worthy,

01:38:32.206 --> 01:38:36.309
the spirit will ascend.

01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:40.381
- And if not?

01:38:45.252 --> 01:38:46.853
This is insane.

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:50.590
- There is no alternative
for repentance.

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:53.359
The lustful soul

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.629
must cross the flames.

01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:58.197
- I can't.

01:38:58.198 --> 01:39:00.767
- You must!

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:03.503
- I won't leave her!

01:39:03.504 --> 01:39:05.238
Not again.

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:08.641
- She is one of the suffering.

01:39:08.642 --> 01:39:12.345
It is not yet her time.

01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:14.747
- Then I will wait

01:39:14.748 --> 01:39:17.016
however long it takes.

01:39:17.017 --> 01:39:21.821
- This is your final
opportunity for salvation.

01:39:21.822 --> 01:39:26.860
Deny it and you will be damned.

01:39:27.528 --> 01:39:31.197
- Then I'll be damned.

01:39:31.198 --> 01:39:33.399
- And you will.

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.768
- Henry.

01:39:35.769 --> 01:39:38.371
Cross the fire.

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:41.307
Repent.

01:39:41.308 --> 01:39:44.310
I love you.

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:46.946
- That's it, Mr. Dawles.

01:39:46.947 --> 01:39:49.816
Walk into the flame.

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:51.851
Become

01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:55.122
penitent.

01:40:40.467 --> 01:40:44.337
- Mr. Remiel can be a
rather demanding soul.

01:40:44.338 --> 01:40:47.140
Just do as he asks
and I promise you,

01:40:47.141 --> 01:40:50.077
compensation can
be quite generous.

01:40:57.718 --> 01:41:00.019
- May I help you?

01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:02.255
Mr. Remiel has put
you at the north end

01:41:02.256 --> 01:41:05.858
of the estate,
overlooking the pond.

01:41:05.859 --> 01:41:08.594
Once you've settled,
you're to join him

01:41:08.595 --> 01:41:12.533
for a nightcap in the library.

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:32.586
- Ma'am.

01:41:34.688 --> 01:41:37.357
Your room.
