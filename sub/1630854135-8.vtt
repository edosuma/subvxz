00:04.526 --> 00:07.137
<i>In the nation's
largest city,</i>

00:07.137 --> 00:09.879
<i>the vicious and violent
members of the underworld</i>

00:09.879 --> 00:11.489
<i>are hunted by the detectives</i>

00:11.489 --> 00:14.710
<i>of the Organized Crime
Control Bureau.</i>

00:14.710 --> 00:17.234
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:18.583 --> 00:20.455
<i>My husband's
a dangerous man.</i>

00:20.455 --> 00:22.152
We can give you protection
if you need it.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.806
I can take care
of myself right now.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.895
Financing, mob connections.

00:25.895 --> 00:27.288
It explains everything.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.725
Agent Leonetti
and I worked a number

00:29.725 --> 00:31.988
of high profile
racketeering cases.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.120
It's good to see you again.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.338
It's nice to see you, Tia.

00:34.338 --> 00:35.731
<i>I could sure use a drink.</i>

00:35.731 --> 00:37.820
- Where you at?
<i>- I'm outside your door.</i>

00:37.820 --> 00:39.691
Are you going to let me in?

00:41.998 --> 00:43.782
<i>You opened up
an investigation</i>

00:43.782 --> 00:45.219
when I told you to wait.

00:45.219 --> 00:47.264
I will not be undermined.
Is that clear?

00:47.264 --> 00:49.179
Very clear.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.746
<i>It's time for everyone
to move on.</i>

00:50.746 --> 00:51.703
<i>End on a high note.</i>

00:51.703 --> 00:53.183
Wait, end?

00:53.183 --> 00:54.706
Stabler's not a good
alliance for you anymore.

00:54.706 --> 00:57.100
It's time for you
to go to the next level.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.584
Mm. We've been on the Moon.

01:02.584 --> 01:03.672
Hmm?

01:03.672 --> 01:05.152
Mankind has
walked on the Moon,

01:05.152 --> 01:06.718
and this is still the
cutting edge of coffee-making?

01:06.718 --> 01:08.416
I don't get it.

01:08.416 --> 01:09.721
Some say the Moon landing was
a hoax to spook the Russians.

01:09.721 --> 01:12.333
Yeah, well,
some people are morons.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.204
What's up, colleagues?

01:14.204 --> 01:15.423
Moon landing, real or not?

01:15.423 --> 01:17.686
Who says there's even a Moon?

01:27.261 --> 01:28.436
Sergeant Bell.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.700
Oh, no, leave it open.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.615
Around here, a closed door
sends a message.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.712
You're closing
the OC Task Force.

01:43.712 --> 01:45.801
Why wasn't I consulted
about this?

01:45.801 --> 01:48.934
Because it wasn't
your decision.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.936
Ayanna, congratulations.

01:50.936 --> 01:54.549
The commissioner approved your
promotion to deputy inspector.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.899
You have a new desk
waiting for you at 1PP.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.860
You do know
what a big deal this is?

02:01.860 --> 02:03.253
What about my detectives?

02:03.253 --> 02:04.733
They'll be reassigned.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.300
I get a say in that.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.649
Of course.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.479
Hey, what about
all of our open cases?

02:11.479 --> 02:12.958
I mean, who's gonna
handle those?

02:12.958 --> 02:14.438
We'll hand them off.

02:14.438 --> 02:16.005
If you want to be part of
the process, fine by me.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.267
Just don't open any new ones.

02:22.794 --> 02:24.579
So this is a done deal?

02:24.579 --> 02:26.450
Not for at least a week.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.939
Hey.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.375
What's going on in there?

02:38.375 --> 02:40.638
The end of days.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.563
Good morning.

02:52.563 --> 02:55.392
Do you have any aspirin?

02:55.392 --> 02:57.177
I've got...

02:59.701 --> 03:01.572
Advil and...

03:03.400 --> 03:05.272
Coconut water.
It's my mom's.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.490
That'll do the trick.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.013
You want some toast?

03:08.013 --> 03:10.102
Mm-mm.

03:10.102 --> 03:11.539
Was the couch okay?

03:13.671 --> 03:15.630
The couch?

03:15.630 --> 03:16.631
- The couch.
- Yeah.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.023
I sleep there all the time.

03:18.023 --> 03:19.590
That's fine, that's fine.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.853
Coffee?
- Espresso.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.292
There you go.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.688
I've never had this much
Grappa in my life.

03:30.688 --> 03:34.344
I'm Italian, and I'll never
drink Grappa again ever.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.346
- Well--
- That's how much I had.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.218
We're celebrating.

03:38.218 --> 03:42.526
Yeah, we had a
good time, I think?

03:42.526 --> 03:44.441
- You don't remember?
- No, I do.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.661
I remember some things.

03:46.661 --> 03:48.837
The important parts,
I guess, yeah.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.839
Good. Mm.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.232
Except her name.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.494
Whose name?

03:56.105 --> 03:58.934
You said there was a woman
you were in love with.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.383
I did?

04:22.566 --> 04:25.874
Love shouldn't
be complicated.

04:25.874 --> 04:28.485
Love affairs, yes.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.008
They can get messy.

04:30.008 --> 04:33.577
But love, that's different.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.713
I'm happy for you.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.979
I booked a flight, by the way.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.592
No reason for me to stay.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.291
Is there?

05:06.915 --> 05:08.656
Detective Stabler.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.704
Teddy Silas.

05:15.924 --> 05:18.622
<i>Carl, how about a wave
for the camera?</i>

05:18.622 --> 05:20.755
<i>When's the casino
gonna open?</i>

05:20.755 --> 05:23.323
One too many, Pearl?

05:25.673 --> 05:26.848
Some creep posted it

05:26.848 --> 05:28.502
right after I got a call
from the hospital.

05:28.502 --> 05:29.590
You know nobody stopped
to help her

05:29.590 --> 05:31.722
till the EMTs arrived?

05:31.722 --> 05:33.376
What do the doctors say?

05:33.376 --> 05:34.464
The doctors, I don't know,

05:34.464 --> 05:35.726
these idiots
won't tell you anything.

05:35.726 --> 05:37.772
They just run tests,
run tests, run tests.

05:37.772 --> 05:40.470
So what can you tell me
about the club?

05:40.470 --> 05:42.603
Some celebrity safe space
we belong to,

05:42.603 --> 05:44.648
but, uh, I never trusted it.

05:44.648 --> 05:45.649
She's not gonna be
responsive right now,

05:45.649 --> 05:47.738
but you can see her.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.174
Doctor.

05:49.174 --> 05:50.828
Detective Stabler.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.482
What can you tell me about
what's going on in there?

05:52.482 --> 05:54.484
I can't say for certain
what entered her system,

05:54.484 --> 05:56.573
but based on the labs
we have run,

05:56.573 --> 05:58.314
pretty confident
something is in there.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.881
The rest I'm not
at liberty to say.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.186
- I understand.
- Excuse me.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.492
Mm-hmm.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.112
This was a message.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.505
What do you mean, a message?

06:17.594 --> 06:20.597
Everyone in my family
is a target.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.382
Constantly getting
death threats.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.819
People hate success
in this city.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.951
Who do you think
is responsible?

06:26.951 --> 06:29.084
I don't know.
That's why I called you.

06:34.481 --> 06:35.569
Sorry.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.746
I just, uh--

06:38.746 --> 06:40.791
I just don't know who to trust.

06:42.576 --> 06:43.751
You call your father?

06:48.190 --> 06:49.887
Pearl trusted you,

06:49.887 --> 06:52.281
even after everything
that happened.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.152
And I want what's best for her.

06:54.152 --> 06:57.939
So please,
find out who did this, okay?

07:53.995 --> 07:56.519
So Teddy's convinced Pearl
was targeted

07:56.519 --> 07:58.434
to send a message
to the family.

07:58.434 --> 07:59.957
She gave us a thumb drive
that has the potential

07:59.957 --> 08:02.046
to bury that family,
and 48 hours later,

08:02.046 --> 08:03.483
there's an attempt made
on her life.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.788
Okay.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.398
So what are you thinking?

08:06.398 --> 08:07.922
Before I start
thinking anything,

08:07.922 --> 08:09.924
I'd like to retrace her steps,
starting with the club.

08:09.924 --> 08:13.754
Robert Silas called me as
soon as you left the hospital.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.103
Why's he calling you?

08:15.103 --> 08:16.800
Well, he heard
from Teddy that

08:16.800 --> 08:18.498
you were gonna be investigating,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.500
and he's worried
you might be biased.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.718
What he's worried about is,

08:21.718 --> 08:23.285
he's the head of a
very dirty family,

08:23.285 --> 08:24.808
and Pearl's not one of them.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.202
Well, we can't take on
any new cases right now.

08:30.161 --> 08:33.687
So I need you
to hand this off.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.954
What exactly did you
and Robert talk about?

08:39.954 --> 08:42.260
This has nothing
to do with Robert.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.654
But I do need to talk
to you about something,

08:44.654 --> 08:47.135
so maybe we can
get a drink later.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.528
What's up?

08:53.010 --> 08:54.925
Let me know.

08:54.925 --> 08:57.362
Elliot.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.713
Yeah?

08:59.713 --> 09:00.888
Hand it off.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.369
Copy.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.463
Whelan, grab a coat.

09:11.463 --> 09:14.379
Let's roll.

09:14.379 --> 09:15.598
What's up?

09:15.598 --> 09:17.644
If anyone asks,
this was the handoff.

09:22.953 --> 09:23.954
Jet.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.176
You find anything on that
thumb drive Pearl gave us?

09:28.176 --> 09:30.178
Most of the financials
are heavily encrypted.

09:30.178 --> 09:32.833
Gonna take
a little bit of time.

09:32.833 --> 09:35.749
Are we under some kind
of deadline to get things done?

09:37.141 --> 09:38.142
Are you?

09:38.142 --> 09:39.796
Do I need to be
under a deadline

09:39.796 --> 09:41.406
for you to do
what I tell you to do?

09:41.406 --> 09:42.756
No, I just--

09:42.756 --> 09:45.280
I thought I was sensing
something in the air.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.586
That's all.

09:57.074 --> 10:00.077
Detectives, I'm Gil.
I'm one of the managers here.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.732
Would you mind if we move this
conversation off the floor?

10:02.732 --> 10:05.169
Last night, one of your
members, Pearl Serrano,

10:05.169 --> 10:07.737
she collapsed outside
after dining here.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.130
Yes, we called
the paramedics.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.174
How is she doing?

10:10.174 --> 10:12.568
Was she alone?

10:12.568 --> 10:13.917
I'm afraid house rules
prohibit me

10:13.917 --> 10:15.527
from giving out information

10:15.527 --> 10:17.573
about who our members
dine with.

10:17.573 --> 10:20.445
Okay, Gil, Mrs. Serrano
is in a coma

10:20.445 --> 10:23.231
at Saint Benjamin's, so...

10:23.231 --> 10:25.276
if the cause of that
started here,

10:25.276 --> 10:27.888
we will find out
who she was here with,

10:27.888 --> 10:29.367
with or without your help.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.326
Subpoena the entire
clientele list?

10:31.326 --> 10:32.632
- And employees.
- Mm-hmm.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.459
Spouses too.

10:34.459 --> 10:35.852
She came in for a drink.

10:35.852 --> 10:36.897
Just herself.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.768
She does that sometimes.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.509
Wasn't here long at all.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.250
Security footage.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.392
What's going on?
What's wrong?

10:54.392 --> 10:55.916
There's nothing here.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.135
Last night's completely erased.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.790
That doesn't look
suspicious at all.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.966
Someone had to
do it manually.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.664
- Where?
- Here.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.970
Who was the last person
in here?

11:06.970 --> 11:09.799
The bartenders come in
to count the cash.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.540
Jace Porter worked last night.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.803
He's one of our new bartenders.

11:13.803 --> 11:16.284
And he never showed up today.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.809
You want me to do what?

11:19.809 --> 11:21.593
The G-6, send it to Berlin

11:21.593 --> 11:23.160
to get Dr. Schneider.
- Why?

11:23.160 --> 11:24.727
'Cause he's the best
hematologist on the planet.

11:24.727 --> 11:25.902
He can tell us
what's wrong with Pearl.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.948
Can you put the
damn phone down, please?

11:27.948 --> 11:29.340
Look at this--
conspiracy theories.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.386
It's a Russian plot.
We're next.

11:31.386 --> 11:32.474
Is that Twitter?

11:32.474 --> 11:33.605
Pearl's lying
in a hospital bed,

11:33.605 --> 11:34.868
nobody can tell
us what's wrong,

11:34.868 --> 11:35.738
and the trolls are out here
making it worse.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.479
Forget that.

11:37.479 --> 11:40.961
You need to divest her
of her casino holdings.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.397
What are you talking about?

11:42.397 --> 11:44.921
Let me ask you something.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.315
Have you thought for one second
who stands to gain

11:47.315 --> 11:49.186
if, God forbid,
the worst happens here?

11:49.186 --> 11:52.102
Her family can claim ownership
of her assets.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.626
And they will, believe me.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.106
How could you think something
like that right now?

11:56.106 --> 12:00.067
When are you gonna
start thinking like that?

12:00.067 --> 12:02.025
You need
to understand something.

12:02.025 --> 12:05.072
When it comes to business,
some of the last people

12:05.072 --> 12:07.204
you can trust are family.

12:07.204 --> 12:09.554
So we need
to protect ourselves.

12:09.554 --> 12:13.210
Divest her of her holdings
until we know what's happened,

12:13.210 --> 12:15.778
or I will divest you of yours.

12:20.696 --> 12:21.784
<i>Jet found a ton on this guy.</i>

12:21.784 --> 12:23.003
Oh, yeah?

12:23.003 --> 12:24.308
Did a year
at Rikers for assault,

12:24.308 --> 12:26.223
and then arrested
three times for drugging

12:26.223 --> 12:29.052
women's drinks at Bowery bars.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.924
I guess the nightclub didn't
bother to do

12:30.924 --> 12:32.664
a background check
before they hired him.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.231
Guess they were
going for a type.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.889
That's our type.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.372
Jace Porter?

12:44.372 --> 12:46.113
Who are you guys?

12:46.113 --> 12:47.941
Detective Stabler.
Detective Whelan.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.030
How you doing today?

12:50.030 --> 12:51.248
What do you want?

12:51.248 --> 12:53.642
Just want to talk.
How you doing today?

12:53.642 --> 12:55.078
Look at this.

12:55.078 --> 12:58.255
Deca-Durabolin,
Winstrol, clenbuterol?

12:58.255 --> 13:00.214
Jesus, you really hate
your liver, don't you?

13:00.214 --> 13:02.346
- Those are legal.
- Okay, Mr. Legal,

13:02.346 --> 13:04.087
you're supposed to be
at work today, correct?

13:04.087 --> 13:05.872
They sent the cops because
I didn't show up for work?

13:05.872 --> 13:07.134
You know anything
about some erased

13:07.134 --> 13:09.092
security footage from the club?

13:09.092 --> 13:11.007
- No.
- You work last night?

13:12.835 --> 13:14.794
Do you know Pearl Serrano?

13:17.231 --> 13:20.147
Flunitrazepam.
It's a fancy name for Rohypnol.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.629
Is that legal?

13:24.629 --> 13:26.457
Date rape drug?

13:26.457 --> 13:28.068
Jace?

13:28.068 --> 13:29.634
You know Pearl Serrano?

13:33.464 --> 13:36.598
You just assaulted
a police officer.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.687
Can he fit in the back seat?

13:38.687 --> 13:41.908
We're could always strap him
to the top of the car.

13:41.908 --> 13:45.128
One, two, three.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.130
What happened
to handing it off?

13:47.130 --> 13:49.132
I did hand it off.
To Jamie.

13:49.132 --> 13:51.134
Oh, that's what
you thought I meant?

13:51.134 --> 13:53.571
Beefcake in there
was running a roofie ring,

13:53.571 --> 13:55.443
and we shut it down.
I mean, he confessed.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.314
He was spiking the drinks
of what he called

13:57.314 --> 14:00.013
famous people, celebrities,
sports figures,

14:00.013 --> 14:01.579
and when they start
acting goofy,

14:01.579 --> 14:02.754
would text his girlfriend,

14:02.754 --> 14:04.104
she'd come down
and record them,

14:04.104 --> 14:05.888
and then they sold
the footage to the tabloids.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.716
Did he confess
to drugging Pearl?

14:07.716 --> 14:08.935
Well, he lawyered up.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.501
Okay, so we don't know
what he did?

14:10.501 --> 14:13.330
A lot of things around here
we don't know.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.767
But look, we've been
working the Silas family

14:15.767 --> 14:16.768
ever since Henry Cole.

14:16.768 --> 14:19.380
No, you broke your word.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.952
Yes?

14:25.952 --> 14:28.171
Labs came back on Pearl.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.912
No Rohypnol
in her blood at all.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.696
Not even alcohol.
- Mm.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.263
She wasn't drinking?

14:33.263 --> 14:34.917
Lab said whatever
was in her system

14:34.917 --> 14:36.440
didn't come from something
she drank.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.007
Well, then,
what is the bartender doing

14:38.007 --> 14:39.966
erasing the security tape?

14:39.966 --> 14:41.489
His girlfriend's
social accounts show

14:41.489 --> 14:44.057
two other club members
acting out that night.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.928
Jace had targets.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.712
They just weren't Pearl.

14:54.806 --> 14:55.851
Okay.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.287
Thanks, doc.

15:01.248 --> 15:03.467
So what you get?

15:03.467 --> 15:04.991
Pearl's doc confirmed
that there was

15:04.991 --> 15:07.384
an unidentifiable substance
in her blood

15:07.384 --> 15:10.648
not tied to any known
medical condition.

15:10.648 --> 15:11.954
So if she was the target

15:11.954 --> 15:13.303
and it didn't happen
in the club,

15:13.303 --> 15:14.739
how did it get in her system?

15:19.788 --> 15:23.096
Hey, Jet, can you pull up
the post of Pearl

15:23.096 --> 15:24.836
leaving the club?

15:24.836 --> 15:27.665
<i>Pearl, how about
a wave for the camera?</i>

15:27.665 --> 15:29.058
<i>When's the casino
gonna open?</i>

15:29.058 --> 15:31.147
It's like it hit her
out of nowhere.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.630
And do you have a post
of her entering?

15:37.675 --> 15:40.504
God, people do love to post
about the rich and famous,

15:40.504 --> 15:42.463
don't they?

15:42.463 --> 15:43.638
She enters, she's fine.

15:43.638 --> 15:46.858
She leaves, she's not.

15:46.858 --> 15:47.990
Freeze it.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.868
What's the difference
in these images?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.960
Guys, I'm lost.
What are we looking for?

16:02.396 --> 16:03.745
The scarf.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.573
There's something
about the scarf.

16:05.573 --> 16:08.532
Something about the scarf.

16:08.532 --> 16:10.012
Jet, I want you to go down
to the hospital.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.275
See if the scarf
is with her belongings.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.407
I'm gonna get a test.

16:13.407 --> 16:14.582
Got it.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.281
Where are you
going with this?

16:18.281 --> 16:20.327
Oh, it's a hunch in search
of a second opinion,

16:20.327 --> 16:24.026
but if I'm right, we need
to get into Teddy's apartment.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.208
So you think Teddy had
something to do with this?

16:32.208 --> 16:33.862
Or he's a target.

16:33.862 --> 16:36.560
So to be safe, let's protect
him for the time being.

16:44.655 --> 16:47.832
Mr. Silas,
Detective Whelan and Reyes.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.138
Right. Yeah, you have news?

16:49.138 --> 16:50.400
Come in.
- Thank you.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.315
Uh, with your permission,
we'd like to have

16:52.315 --> 16:55.536
our forensic people
take a look in your apartment.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.016
What for?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.887
It's possible the substance
used against your wife

16:58.887 --> 17:00.932
could have originated here,
and if so,

17:00.932 --> 17:04.153
you could be in danger.
- Wait.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.721
I go to Stabler for help,
he's making me a suspect?

17:06.721 --> 17:08.505
No.
No one said you're a suspect.

17:08.505 --> 17:09.506
You're searching
my apartment.

17:09.506 --> 17:10.551
Seems like it.

17:10.551 --> 17:11.769
It's for your safety.

17:11.769 --> 17:12.901
Right.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.859
You tell Stabler I trusted him,

17:14.859 --> 17:16.470
but if he's gonna send his
lackeys by

17:16.470 --> 17:18.776
to kick me out of my own house,
I don't feel safe anymore.

17:18.776 --> 17:19.777
Goodbye.

17:21.475 --> 17:22.911
Goodbye!

17:32.747 --> 17:34.401
I was in the shower
when you texted.

17:34.401 --> 17:35.880
What time's your flight?

17:35.880 --> 17:37.578
What the hell happened
to your room?

17:37.578 --> 17:39.058
Looks like Fashion Week
blew up.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.408
I swear I didn't have this
much when I first packed.

17:41.408 --> 17:43.801
Did you get my text?
Make sense?

17:43.801 --> 17:48.197
Uh, "Do you remember
the ascot murders?"

17:48.197 --> 17:49.416
The Caligari family, yes.

17:49.416 --> 17:50.591
- Yes.
- What about them?

17:50.591 --> 17:51.940
Remember how those
murders went down?

17:53.898 --> 17:55.422
They had poison laced
into their clothing.

17:55.422 --> 17:56.945
One was an ascot.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.077
It took months to figure out.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.122
It was you who came up
with the theory.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.690
There's a young woman
named Pearl Serrano.

18:02.690 --> 18:05.736
She's a part of a very powerful
family here in New York.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.738
They've got mob ties.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.958
She was at a club.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.874
Put on a scarf, collapses,
and she's now in a coma.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.180
Huh.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.616
What kind of business?

18:15.616 --> 18:16.965
Builders.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.619
Right now,
they're building a casino,

18:18.619 --> 18:20.708
and Pearl's been
pointing fingers

18:20.708 --> 18:22.927
at some very
high level associates.

18:22.927 --> 18:25.104
So they found out and they
tried to take her down?

18:28.281 --> 18:29.891
It's a theory.

18:29.891 --> 18:32.285
I know you long enough
to know better than to doubt

18:32.285 --> 18:33.938
when you have a theory.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.158
The toxicology report
came back, it was inconclusive,

18:36.158 --> 18:39.466
so the lab is now
analyzing the clothes.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.642
Elliot,

18:41.642 --> 18:43.818
are you asking me to stay?

18:47.169 --> 18:49.389
Hey, Jet, you got
it tested already?

18:49.389 --> 18:51.652
I could tell you all
the favors I called in,

18:51.652 --> 18:52.870
but it won't make
you appreciate me

18:52.870 --> 18:54.959
any more than you already do.

18:54.959 --> 18:57.788
Atropa belladonna, gets its
name from the Italian words--

18:57.788 --> 19:00.356
both:
Beautiful lady.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.184
I was gonna do that.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.707
The plant is high
in toxic chemicals

19:03.707 --> 19:05.840
solanine, hyoscine,
and atropine.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.582
It's also called
deadly nightshade.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.018
I-I just Googled it.

19:10.018 --> 19:11.541
So that's what was
on the scarf?

19:11.541 --> 19:14.327
Yes--and it's not the first
time poison-laced clothing

19:14.327 --> 19:17.199
has been used in an
attempted plot to kill.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.332
Sasha Krupin,
big Kremlin critic,

19:19.332 --> 19:22.726
had Russian FSB officers
put some in his underwear

19:22.726 --> 19:25.381
back in 2020 to take him out,
and look at this.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.949
Former Mafia enforcers
all convicted and serving

19:27.949 --> 19:31.692
life sentences mysteriously
died from the same poison

19:31.692 --> 19:33.433
back in Sicily four years ago.

19:33.433 --> 19:34.869
You don't say.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.218
If you dig a little deeper
into that article,

19:36.218 --> 19:37.567
her name's in it.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.134
Detective Stabler
declined to comment,

19:39.134 --> 19:41.397
but it was his theory
that solved the case.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.660
- It was a scarf.
- It was.

19:43.660 --> 19:46.228
So we think the mob
went after Pearl.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.012
Why?

19:48.012 --> 19:49.536
You find anything on the thumb
drive that can confirm motive?

19:49.536 --> 19:50.928
I'm working on it.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.582
Oh, someone didn't
finish the job.

19:52.582 --> 19:54.497
We need to move fast.

19:54.497 --> 19:56.847
This is Detective Stabler
regarding Pearl Serrano...

19:56.847 --> 19:58.240
Stellar work, by the way.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.201
You know, I forgot to mention
I have a Dutch passport,

20:02.201 --> 20:04.725
so working overseas
isn't a problem for me.

20:04.725 --> 20:05.726
That's great.
Thank you.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.597
Offer still stands.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.122
I called the hospital.
Pearl's awake.

20:13.690 --> 20:15.431
Follow up with Toxicology.
I'll talk to her.

20:19.870 --> 20:22.438
Hey, doc. Pearl Serrano.

20:22.438 --> 20:23.570
Did she get moved
to another room?

20:23.570 --> 20:24.919
Oh, you just missed her.

20:24.919 --> 20:26.355
What do you mean
I just missed her?

20:26.355 --> 20:28.314
A private ambulance
company showed up,

20:28.314 --> 20:31.578
said they were with her family,
and they transported her out.

20:31.578 --> 20:32.796
Where did they take her?

20:32.796 --> 20:34.407
Sorry, I don't know.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.539
Once she leaves the hospital,
we have no idea where they go.

20:36.539 --> 20:37.714
Good luck.

20:39.020 --> 20:39.890
T, you're not gonna
believe this.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.065
Get ready to move.

20:45.635 --> 20:48.421
<i>I made a call to the
NYPD liaison at the hospital</i>

20:48.421 --> 20:49.683
who heads up hospital security.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.119
He did us a solid,

20:51.119 --> 20:52.729
checked out the
ambulance visit database.

20:52.729 --> 20:53.904
Good. What you got?

20:53.904 --> 20:55.254
<i>Ambulance that left
with Pearl,</i>

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
<i>headed to 32nd Ave
and Linden Place.</i>

20:57.256 --> 20:58.561
Jet, you're amazing.

20:58.561 --> 20:59.562
<i>I know.</i>

20:59.562 --> 21:00.650
And humble.

21:03.566 --> 21:06.265
You sure Jet got us
the right address?

21:08.136 --> 21:09.442
She's never wrong.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.329
- Hi.
- Hi, Eva.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.417
How you doing?

21:28.417 --> 21:30.289
I'm good.
Can I help you?

21:30.289 --> 21:32.552
We're looking for Pearl.

21:32.552 --> 21:35.685
She's actually not here.

21:35.685 --> 21:38.122
We have reason to believe
her life is still in danger.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.689
Look, you're her sister.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.778
You want to help her?
Let us in.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.787
Okay, just wait here.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.620
I told you not
to let anybody in.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.405
I'm sorry, but they're cops,
and they wouldn't

21:59.405 --> 22:01.276
take no for an answer.

22:02.625 --> 22:05.106
How'd you find me?

22:05.106 --> 22:08.196
How are you feeling?

22:08.196 --> 22:09.589
Well, I woke up
in the hospital

22:09.589 --> 22:11.373
not knowing
what happened to me,

22:11.373 --> 22:13.332
and the doctors told me
I was poisoned.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.203
So how do you think I feel?

22:17.031 --> 22:18.902
I asked Eva to pick me up.

22:18.902 --> 22:20.469
I don't trust anybody else.

22:20.469 --> 22:22.341
Who do you think
did this to you?

22:24.517 --> 22:26.997
You think Teddy might have
had something to do with it?

22:29.130 --> 22:32.873
I don't want to believe
he did.

22:32.873 --> 22:35.092
But I don't know.

22:35.092 --> 22:36.746
Well, if he
wants to find you,

22:36.746 --> 22:38.661
don't you think your sister's
is the first place he'll look?

22:38.661 --> 22:41.055
Well, it's her friend's
place, and she's out of town,

22:41.055 --> 22:42.796
so he won't know that I'm here.

22:42.796 --> 22:46.365
Well, the scarf you wore
the night you collapsed

22:46.365 --> 22:49.411
was laced with poison.

22:49.411 --> 22:52.327
Do you recall anyone
touching it at the club?

22:52.327 --> 22:54.808
Ever leave your sight?

22:54.808 --> 22:57.941
Um, no, it was delivered
by a dry cleaners,

22:57.941 --> 22:59.813
and I put it in my purse,

22:59.813 --> 23:01.728
and the purse
never left my side.

23:03.469 --> 23:06.297
Who's your dry cleaners?

23:06.297 --> 23:08.517
Well, thanks for your time.
I appreciate it.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.258
Doorman from her building
said it wasn't

23:10.258 --> 23:12.956
the normal delivery person.

23:12.956 --> 23:14.741
Do we know who it was?

23:14.741 --> 23:16.395
Well, doorman
had him sign in.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.398
Put down the dry cleaning
company as "Belucci."

23:22.575 --> 23:24.838
In relation to Luca Belucci,
you think?

23:24.838 --> 23:27.318
Castellammare soldier
out of Sicily?

23:28.842 --> 23:30.409
I have a contact here
in New York.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.714
We can find out.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.063
Let's find out.

23:42.159 --> 23:43.552
<i>Ciao bella, come stai?</i>

23:43.552 --> 23:45.424
<i>- Bene, bene.</i>
- Good.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.860
<i>Andiamo.</i> Come here.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.252
Please, sit.

23:48.252 --> 23:51.299
Federico, antipasto
and Grappa for my friends--

23:51.299 --> 23:53.519
both:
No Grappa.

23:53.519 --> 23:56.870
Detective Stabler and I
are here on business.

23:56.870 --> 23:58.306
Something serious?

24:00.439 --> 24:02.484
What do you need from me?

24:02.484 --> 24:04.921
We're working a case
involving someone

24:04.921 --> 24:07.141
we are all familiar with.

24:07.141 --> 24:08.185
Luca Belucci.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.927
He's a bad seed.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.625
He in town?

24:12.625 --> 24:14.496
When Luca's in town,
everyone knows it.

24:14.496 --> 24:15.932
So is he in town?

24:15.932 --> 24:18.587
Yes, he's here.

24:18.587 --> 24:19.806
And do you know where
we could find him?

24:21.764 --> 24:23.549
His cousin Francesca
has a dry cleaning

24:23.549 --> 24:25.681
and tailor shop
on Broome Street.

24:25.681 --> 24:28.597
When Luca's here,
he stays with her.

24:28.597 --> 24:30.120
Upstairs apartment.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.557
But Tia--

24:31.557 --> 24:32.993
We didn't hear it from you.

24:32.993 --> 24:34.995
<i>Grazie mille.</i>

24:34.995 --> 24:36.170
<i>Ciao.</i>

24:36.170 --> 24:37.519
You know the dry cleaners
on Broome?

24:37.519 --> 24:38.999
I want to get
a warrant first.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.783
Pearl ID'd him.
We have probable cause.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.132
Which means we have enough
for a warrant.

24:42.132 --> 24:43.569
Don't worry about it.
It's not like Sicily.

24:43.569 --> 24:44.918
I got a friend.
I'll make a call.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.223
We'll have it before
we're across town.

24:46.223 --> 24:48.225
You got a friend?

24:48.225 --> 24:50.053
It's exactly like Sicily.

25:02.849 --> 25:04.807
We'll take the front.
You guys secure the back.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.026
Copy that.

25:08.071 --> 25:09.551
Know how to use this?

25:09.551 --> 25:11.248
The numbers are in English,
but the--

25:11.248 --> 25:12.336
Funny.

25:19.039 --> 25:20.910
Hey, Luca. NYPD.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.872
Back out the way.

25:49.243 --> 25:50.592
Get out of the way!

25:54.683 --> 25:56.598
Police! Don't move!
Don't move!

26:05.302 --> 26:07.740
You're telling us
you decided to travel

26:07.740 --> 26:09.306
all the way from Sicily
to New York for a suit.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.570
No one fits a silhouette
like my cousin Francesca.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.788
Right, because it's
so difficult to find

26:12.788 --> 26:14.311
a decent tailor in Italy.

26:14.311 --> 26:16.487
Clearly neither one
of you would understand

26:16.487 --> 26:17.924
when it comes to fashion.

26:17.924 --> 26:19.273
Well, what I
consider fashionable

26:19.273 --> 26:21.318
is seeing you
in an orange jumpsuit.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.320
I can get you fitted
for one if you'd like.

26:25.105 --> 26:27.803
This guy's name ever
come up on a thumb drive?

26:27.803 --> 26:29.022
Not yet.

26:31.981 --> 26:36.029
So earlier, you asked me
about a deadline.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.641
It sounded like you were
fishing for something.

26:39.641 --> 26:41.121
I wasn't.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.515
Okay.

26:44.515 --> 26:47.388
'Cause, you know, one thing
I don't want in this office

26:47.388 --> 26:50.043
is for there to be
rumors spreading.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.046
Am I clear?

26:53.046 --> 26:54.482
Yeah, absolutely.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.360
<i>You know what I think?</i>

27:03.360 --> 27:05.188
<i>You were sent here
to do a job,</i>

27:05.188 --> 27:07.408
and that job
was to kill Pearl Serrano.

27:07.408 --> 27:08.278
Ah, come on.

27:08.278 --> 27:10.933
Luca.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.022
You delivered a scarf
laced with poison

27:13.022 --> 27:14.545
from your cousin's cleaners.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.199
So I delivered it.

27:16.199 --> 27:18.201
I didn't know
there was anything on it.

27:18.201 --> 27:20.203
So why'd you run when we
came knocking on your door?

27:20.203 --> 27:22.075
Where I'm from,
you see men with guns,

27:22.075 --> 27:23.903
you either shoot back,
or you run.

27:23.903 --> 27:26.035
Or because Pearl
is still alive,

27:26.035 --> 27:27.863
you thought we were
the guys sent to whack you

27:27.863 --> 27:29.169
because you botched the job.

27:29.169 --> 27:30.649
Mr. Belucci,
not another word.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.215
Excuse us.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.696
This is Ms. Gleeson,
his lawyer.

27:34.696 --> 27:37.612
Unless you're charging my
client, we're out of here.

27:42.399 --> 27:44.271
He can go.

27:44.271 --> 27:45.881
I'm sure we'll see you again.

27:45.881 --> 27:47.274
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

27:51.234 --> 27:54.020
I want Reyes and Jamie
following him

27:54.020 --> 27:56.239
everywhere he goes,
but discreetly.

27:56.239 --> 27:58.807
That lawyer, she was
at the groundbreaking ceremony

27:58.807 --> 28:00.461
of the casino in September.

28:02.115 --> 28:04.465
I think she represents
Teddy Silas.

28:04.465 --> 28:06.075
You sure?

28:06.075 --> 28:08.861
I'd like to see him
deny it to my face.

28:08.861 --> 28:10.340
Let's take a ride.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.955
So I spoke to my girl at 1PP.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.565
About?

28:17.565 --> 28:19.001
Our unit.

28:19.001 --> 28:21.482
If we're really
being shut down.

28:21.482 --> 28:22.613
Rumors are true.

28:22.613 --> 28:24.746
No.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.269
My girl wouldn't lie.

28:26.269 --> 28:27.880
It makes no sense.
We're killing it here.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.359
I know.

28:29.359 --> 28:31.448
The Russo take-down,
Vaughn and his crew.

28:31.448 --> 28:32.885
And not to mention
the Brotherhood

28:32.885 --> 28:34.364
before we even got here.

28:34.364 --> 28:35.322
Mm-hmm.

28:37.150 --> 28:39.500
Maybe we're just too good.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.762
What?

28:40.762 --> 28:42.285
Maybe somebody got
nervous at the top,

28:42.285 --> 28:44.635
and they worried that
we might come after them too.

28:44.635 --> 28:46.725
What's up with you and your
conspiracy theories today?

28:46.725 --> 28:48.770
You know how many turn out to
be true when you really look?

28:48.770 --> 28:53.732
Or, get this, it sounds
even crazier, budget cuts.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.647
It could be as simple as that.

28:56.647 --> 28:57.997
You're a detective.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.215
You gotta keep
every possibility open

28:59.215 --> 29:00.608
until proven otherwise.

29:03.654 --> 29:04.786
<i>Are you serious?</i>

29:04.786 --> 29:06.570
You're accusing Teddy
of being involved

29:06.570 --> 29:08.485
with what happened
to his wife now?

29:08.485 --> 29:10.313
No, I simply want him
to explain why he shares

29:10.313 --> 29:11.750
the same lawyer as Luca.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.926
I share a lawyer
with a Democratic senator.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.579
Doesn't make me blue.

29:19.061 --> 29:20.671
Italian proverb.

29:20.671 --> 29:24.327
It means it's good to trust,
but it's better not to.

29:26.982 --> 29:28.201
Who are you?

29:28.201 --> 29:30.420
Interpol, Rome.

29:31.595 --> 29:33.032
What the hell's
going on here?

29:33.032 --> 29:35.469
What's going on here,
your family has Mafia ties,

29:35.469 --> 29:37.863
and I'm here to tell them
how they fit together.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.212
What Mafia ties?

29:39.212 --> 29:40.561
We met your friend
Luca Belucci.

29:40.561 --> 29:41.823
Who?

29:41.823 --> 29:44.957
Business associate,
to be more precise.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.002
But your lawyer will
tell you since you both pay her

29:47.002 --> 29:48.090
to cover your asses.

29:48.090 --> 29:49.265
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.832
Luca Belucci, I know that name.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.486
What is he--he has
something to do with Pearl?

29:52.486 --> 29:54.140
- You're not talking to them.
- Does he know where she is?

29:54.140 --> 29:55.315
- You're not talking to them.
- If they know where she is--

29:55.315 --> 29:57.839
Go. I'll handle this.

30:04.541 --> 30:08.371
Detective, you are beyond
wearing out your welcome.

30:08.371 --> 30:11.374
My place, my rules,
as you well know,

30:11.374 --> 30:13.768
and I want you gone now.

30:15.465 --> 30:18.773
Or I can call my lawyer,
who, as you can guess,

30:18.773 --> 30:20.993
has a direct line at 1PP.

30:31.264 --> 30:34.093
I was very impressed
with you back there.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.572
Why? I didn't get anything.

30:35.572 --> 30:38.401
You translated
my Italian perfectly.

30:38.401 --> 30:40.751
My Italian's not that bad.

30:44.190 --> 30:45.626
Really?

30:45.626 --> 30:46.757
Mm-hmm.

30:52.285 --> 30:54.113
You got everything
you need now.

30:54.113 --> 30:56.158
It's time for me to go.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.727
I like having you here.

31:01.598 --> 31:03.905
You go back to your life,
I go back to my hotel room,

31:03.905 --> 31:05.385
finish packing.

31:05.385 --> 31:08.910
Catch the flight tonight.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.477
Okay?

31:12.827 --> 31:14.220
As you wish.

31:22.706 --> 31:25.100
Want me to put in a call
to Fazio?

31:25.100 --> 31:26.928
Put in a good word?
- No.

31:26.928 --> 31:29.452
I'm gonna get a slap
on my wrist no matter what.

31:29.452 --> 31:32.064
He knows who he's dealing with.
- So do I.

31:38.331 --> 31:40.202
Goodbye, Elliot.

31:59.134 --> 32:00.744
Hey.

32:00.744 --> 32:03.878
Whoever it is
you're in love with,

32:03.878 --> 32:05.401
she's a lucky woman.

32:10.885 --> 32:11.886
<i>Ciao.</i>

32:15.846 --> 32:18.023
Reyes, what's up?

32:27.597 --> 32:29.469
Double check everything?
- Triple.

32:29.469 --> 32:31.384
Registered to the Office
of Luca and Teddy's attorney.

32:31.384 --> 32:33.168
Jamie's got eyes on him.

32:33.168 --> 32:34.169
Parking garage.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.972
Teddy, drop the bat.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.760
Teddy.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.848
Drop the bat.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.248
He tried to kill my wife.

33:16.168 --> 33:18.039
Where the hell's the bus?

33:18.039 --> 33:19.214
Guys are saying
they're stuck in traffic.

33:19.214 --> 33:22.565
Three minutes.

33:22.565 --> 33:24.480
- Is he dead?
- Not yet.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.047
- I hope he dies.
- Do you?

33:26.047 --> 33:28.049
Because right now,
it looks like you hired him

33:28.049 --> 33:29.833
to kill your wife,
and then when he failed,

33:29.833 --> 33:31.531
you tried to kill him
to shut him up.

33:31.531 --> 33:32.836
Right now,
you're one breath away

33:32.836 --> 33:34.229
from being charged
with first degree murder,

33:34.229 --> 33:35.665
so if there's anything
else you want to tell me,

33:35.665 --> 33:37.276
now's your shot.

33:38.712 --> 33:39.887
I know I'm not a good person.

33:39.887 --> 33:42.890
I'm not a good husband.

33:42.890 --> 33:45.110
But I love my wife.

33:45.110 --> 33:47.677
She's my world.

33:47.677 --> 33:50.332
And I did not hire
that man to kill her.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.030
So why beat his brains in?

33:52.030 --> 33:53.509
When you told me that
we shared the same lawyer,

33:53.509 --> 33:56.512
I came here to confront him.

33:56.512 --> 33:58.775
"Did you poison Pearl?"

33:58.775 --> 34:01.169
He didn't deny anything, so...

34:03.302 --> 34:04.912
I had to.

34:06.218 --> 34:07.741
Why?

34:09.656 --> 34:11.484
You don't believe me.

34:11.484 --> 34:14.226
It doesn't matter.

34:14.226 --> 34:15.792
Pearl is pregnant!

34:19.970 --> 34:22.060
Luca's trying
to say something.

34:26.194 --> 34:27.717
Luca, it's Detective Stabler.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.023
Can you hear me?

34:31.330 --> 34:33.201
Luca, can you hear me?

34:35.290 --> 34:36.639
Yeah, what?

34:36.639 --> 34:39.860
Are you Catholic?

34:39.860 --> 34:43.298
Yes, I am Catholic.

34:51.306 --> 34:53.221
I can do that.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.706
In the name of the Father
and Son and the Holy Ghost.

34:59.706 --> 35:02.100
May Christ who was
crucified for you...

35:04.711 --> 35:07.670
Bring you freedom and peace.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.585
May Christ who died
for you admit you

35:09.585 --> 35:11.848
into his garden of paradise.

35:11.848 --> 35:14.068
May Christ,
the true Shepherd...

35:16.070 --> 35:20.118
Acknowledge you as one
of His flock.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.902
May He forgive you your sins

35:21.902 --> 35:24.339
and set you among those
He's chosen.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.778
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

35:28.778 --> 35:29.910
Amen.

35:34.436 --> 35:35.437
What?

35:45.012 --> 35:46.187
That the truth?

35:55.501 --> 35:59.200
Sarge, Robert Silas is gone.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.288
Yeah.

36:00.288 --> 36:01.724
Well, that's where
I'm going now.

36:09.384 --> 36:10.994
Teddy.

36:10.994 --> 36:12.387
You heard from Pearl?

36:12.387 --> 36:14.694
I did.

36:14.694 --> 36:15.912
She's doing good.

36:15.912 --> 36:17.479
She's good.

36:17.479 --> 36:18.741
The baby?

36:18.741 --> 36:19.742
Same.

36:19.742 --> 36:22.049
Good, good.

36:23.790 --> 36:26.053
So is she gonna come see me?

36:26.053 --> 36:27.924
She didn't say. I don't know.

36:27.924 --> 36:30.405
You told her what
I did for her, right?

36:30.405 --> 36:31.841
You told her that
I did this for her?

36:31.841 --> 36:34.104
I did, Teddy, yes.

36:34.104 --> 36:36.498
But I'm here for another
reason, and I gotta...

36:38.326 --> 36:41.242
Say something to you that's
gonna be very hard to hear.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.986
Your father was the one who--

36:48.771 --> 36:49.685
Your father was
the one who paid

36:49.685 --> 36:51.992
to have your wife murdered.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.128
- How do you know that?
- Luca told me.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.568
We tried to arrest him,
he split.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.526
Any idea where he might go?

37:06.049 --> 37:07.137
No, I don't.

37:07.137 --> 37:08.356
I'd like to go back to my cell.

37:08.356 --> 37:09.488
Teddy.

37:09.488 --> 37:11.707
I would like
to go back to my cell.

37:11.707 --> 37:13.274
Thank you.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.150
He's a dangerous man.

37:22.109 --> 37:23.458
Only you can put a stop to it.

37:26.374 --> 37:28.637
Robert Jr.

37:28.637 --> 37:30.509
What?

37:30.509 --> 37:33.338
Wanted us to name
his grandson after him.

37:34.861 --> 37:37.516
And we were going to.

37:40.823 --> 37:42.260
To honor him.

38:02.062 --> 38:03.542
Elliot, can I?

38:12.768 --> 38:14.509
You can close the door.

38:14.509 --> 38:17.251
I wanted to discuss this
with you outside the office,

38:17.251 --> 38:19.732
but you know,
time has become a thing.

38:19.732 --> 38:21.560
Always is, right?

38:21.560 --> 38:22.561
What's up?

38:28.131 --> 38:31.004
I'm taking a promotion.

38:31.004 --> 38:33.920
Congratulations.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.138
Deputy inspector.

38:35.138 --> 38:38.228
That's great.

38:38.228 --> 38:40.013
Taking the job
is gonna change

38:40.013 --> 38:41.493
some things around here now.

38:41.493 --> 38:43.016
Oh, I know.

38:44.757 --> 38:46.280
You know what?

38:47.673 --> 38:50.066
About the promotion.

38:50.066 --> 38:51.503
About the task force
being broken up.

38:51.503 --> 38:53.243
You knew?

38:53.243 --> 38:55.768
You work in a place filled
with detectives, you know.

38:55.768 --> 38:56.986
I've known for a while.

38:56.986 --> 38:58.510
Wait, wait,
so everybody knows?

38:58.510 --> 39:00.294
I don't know about that.
I haven't said anything.

39:00.294 --> 39:01.687
You'd have to ask them.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.602
Well, why didn't you
ask me about it?

39:05.691 --> 39:07.606
Look, we're friends.

39:07.606 --> 39:11.914
I figured when you were ready,
you'd come to me.

39:11.914 --> 39:14.308
If not, you know,
none of my business.

39:16.310 --> 39:17.703
So you're okay with this?

39:17.703 --> 39:19.226
Oh, no.

39:19.226 --> 39:21.750
No, not by a long shot.

39:25.711 --> 39:28.366
Just wish you'd told me sooner.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.672
Well, I was still
trying to decide.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.152
There you go.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.594
Maybe I could have
helped you decide.

39:39.594 --> 39:42.467
Okay.

39:42.467 --> 39:45.034
So that's what your
little attitude is about.

39:45.034 --> 39:47.428
My little attitude?

39:47.428 --> 39:49.343
I'm not the one keeping secrets

39:49.343 --> 39:50.866
that's gonna screw
with people's lives.

39:50.866 --> 39:54.304
And because you feel guilty
about your decision,

39:54.304 --> 39:57.438
don't place the
little attitude thing on me.

39:57.438 --> 40:00.441
Okay, well,
maybe you were just pissed

40:00.441 --> 40:03.270
because I didn't ask
for your permission.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.143
Okay, this task force
was started because

40:07.143 --> 40:09.015
of what happened to my wife.

40:11.670 --> 40:17.066
My heart and soul are in this
place, and you knew that.

40:17.066 --> 40:18.459
So either you chose
to ignore it,

40:18.459 --> 40:20.635
or you decided that
it didn't matter.

40:20.635 --> 40:23.725
But, hey, you're the boss, so
it's your prerogative, right?

40:25.771 --> 40:28.164
Thanks for the drink.

40:50.883 --> 40:52.232
So you all knew?
