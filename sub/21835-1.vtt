WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.099
This programme contains
some strong language,

00:04.123 --> 00:06.176
scenes which some viewers
may find upsetting

00:06.200 --> 00:07.736
and some scenes of a sexual nature

00:07.760 --> 00:10.175
The acid murder case,
which has been dominating

00:10.199 --> 00:12.056
the press for the
last three months,

00:12.080 --> 00:15.056
has seen a total of seven bodies
discovered across the city, their

00:15.080 --> 00:18.976
faces brutally burnt with acid in
order to conceal their identities.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.096
Following an arrest attempt.

00:21.120 --> 00:24.280
He died at the scene. His
family have been informed.

00:25.440 --> 00:29.176
He was believed to be suffering
from paranoia and schizophrenia.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.735
The IPCC commissioner said,
"Fatal shootings by police

00:32.759 --> 00:35.736
"are extremely rare and
understandably raise"

00:35.760 --> 00:37.816
"very significant
community concerns."

00:37.840 --> 00:39.720
There will be a full investigation.

01:32.480 --> 01:35.160
Excuse me, sir, we don't
sell any alcohol between...

01:37.880 --> 01:39.400
Keep the change.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.400
Thanks.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.456
OK? Promise you'll come and
see your mother with me,

02:16.480 --> 02:18.816
and then everything'll
be back to normal.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.360
Why can't you just tell
me what's going on?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.616
And then everything'll
be back to normal.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.496
Why can't you just tell
me what's going on?

02:27.520 --> 02:30.936
OK? Promise you'll come and
see your mother with me,

02:30.960 --> 02:33.080
and then everything'll
be back to normal.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.360
Beth!

04:27.000 --> 04:29.840
Sorry about that. Queenie,
what's the matter with you?!

04:51.200 --> 04:54.840
Beth! Beth!

04:58.840 --> 05:00.080
Steven Mills?

05:02.840 --> 05:04.400
Mr Mills, I'm DCI Markham.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.936
But you know who I am, don't you?

05:08.960 --> 05:10.000
You're not...

05:11.960 --> 05:13.656
Where are they?

05:13.680 --> 05:15.656
Your wife and daughter are with us.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.576
They're safe.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.720
Get back!

05:20.840 --> 05:24.016
I need to speak to her.
I need to know...

05:24.040 --> 05:26.240
Put your weapon down
and come with me.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.376
It's not me.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.816
Are you armed, Steven?

05:30.840 --> 05:33.856
They need to know, I had to.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.440
I fucking had to!

05:37.280 --> 05:40.056
You can see your family, Steven.

05:40.080 --> 05:44.280
But first you need to calm down
and you need to come with me.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.776
Now. I need to speak
to them right now.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.080
Look around you, Steven.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.280
There are armed officers
watching every move you make.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.016
Suspect in our sights, stay back.
He may be armed.

06:11.040 --> 06:14.576
Put your hands behind your head
and get down on your knees.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.000
They need to know the truth.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.816
I have to speak to them now.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.520
He's reaching for his gun.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.760
He was reaching for his phone.

08:05.240 --> 08:08.120
- Are we home?
- Yes, love. Ssh, shh, shh, shh.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.360
When's Daddy coming home?

08:13.640 --> 08:15.376
It's all right, Ali.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.736
Let's just get you to bed.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.000
There we are.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.680
You came.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.360
Yeah.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.016
The boys are really getting on it.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.440
Yeah. They're celebrating.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.376
You're not going to have a drink?
Not even now?

10:19.400 --> 10:21.016
Don't see any reason to.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.016
We just shot a guy
reaching for his phone.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.976
A very scared guy.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.920
A guy who killed seven people.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.600
And what he did to you...

10:32.680 --> 10:34.176
It's a win, Gabriel.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.256
A big win.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.736
Why do people keep telling me that?

10:37.760 --> 10:40.856
We found unmistakable forensic
evidence at the crime scene.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.816
We've been here before,
with Christine.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.413
Thinking we had
it all figured out.

10:44.437 --> 10:45.296
This is different.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.720
Is it?

10:49.040 --> 10:51.056
What if we killed an innocent man?

10:51.080 --> 10:52.520
Gabriel, he did it.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.200
We caught a break.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.896
Or someone knew we
were getting close

10:59.920 --> 11:01.520
so they did something about it.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.416
I mean, he was one of
Isaac Taylor's patients.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.176
Why... Why didn't I see that?!

11:08.200 --> 11:09.840
Would it have made a difference?

11:10.960 --> 11:12.320
Yeah.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.016
I don't know.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.440
Maybe.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.176
You just need some proper rest.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.800
You're not thinking straight.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.216
No.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.280
I'm not.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.560
I still see you the way I did.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.440
I don't see the scars.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.080
Talk to me.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.816
I thought that's
what we were doing.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.360
You know what I mean.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.560
Talking doesn't fix
anything, though, does it?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.200
I love you, Gabriel.

12:43.640 --> 12:44.840
You should go.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.456
I understand the visitation right.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.056
Lucy, these are my children,
I can see them when I want.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.120
No, she didn't.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.296
Ready for us.

13:46.320 --> 13:47.960
I've got to go.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.696
Steven Mills' name is
all over the news.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.136
Any idea who might've leaked it?

13:54.160 --> 13:56.416
High-profile case, hard to contain.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.880
Gabriel...

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
people would understand if
you'd rather sit this one out.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.776
I told you, I'm fine.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.936
That counsellor you stuck
me with say any different?

14:06.960 --> 14:10.816
No. Not at all, she
says you're doing well.

14:10.840 --> 14:13.416
But we're talking about leading
the arrest of the person

14:13.440 --> 14:14.145
who attacked you.

14:14.169 --> 14:16.256
Right now he's a suspect
in one murder, that's all.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.696
Oh, come on.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.016
You have to understand, this
is not an easy call to make.

14:20.040 --> 14:23.896
If you want me off the case, you're
going to have to make it an order.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.160
We both know why you won't.

14:28.720 --> 14:29.920
Let me do this.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.216
This is Steven Mills.

14:45.240 --> 14:48.216
His fingerprints were found at this
morning's murder scene, which makes

14:48.240 --> 14:51.376
him the primary suspect in at least
six other murders with the same MO.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.776
This has been a long time coming.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.336
People are scared.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.136
Let's do this right, OK?

14:56.160 --> 14:57.280
Gabriel.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.400
Mills suffers from schizophrenia.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.016
He's displayed violent
behaviour in the past,

15:13.040 --> 15:15.376
and chances are he's armed -

15:15.400 --> 15:18.736
there were reports of gunshots
at the crime scene this morning.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.896
Tactical Firearms Unit
will provide backup.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.616
But I shouldn't have to say

15:23.640 --> 15:27.256
we'd all rather this happened
quietly and peacefully.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.520
OK?

15:30.200 --> 15:31.440
OK.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.896
Come on. Come on!

15:46.920 --> 15:48.416
Enough, enough! Finish!

15:48.440 --> 15:50.096
Asim! What's wrong with you?

15:50.120 --> 15:52.496
- This is none of your business.
- Calm it down, yeah?

15:52.520 --> 15:54.600
- I'm fine. - You sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Let go.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.416
Look, is this going
to be a problem?

15:57.440 --> 15:59.496
What's going on with the
two of you, anyway?

15:59.520 --> 16:01.776
Why are you at each
other's throats?

16:01.800 --> 16:03.120
Ask him.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.320
Let's break it up, let's go.
Let's go.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.696
Just walk away.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.280
Walk away!

16:12.840 --> 16:14.496
What the hell was that about?

16:14.520 --> 16:15.640
No idea.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.160
Sooner we find this
bastard, the better.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.896
The name of the prime suspect
in the acid murders case

16:56.920 --> 16:58.336
has been leaked to the press.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.936
He has been identified as
42-year-old Steven Mills.

17:01.960 --> 17:03.800
You all right, boss?

17:06.720 --> 17:07.839
Yeah, just thinking.

17:10.119 --> 17:11.599
About Steven Mills.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.816
About why anyone would kill all
those people, the way he did...

17:17.839 --> 17:20.215
He wasn't right in
the head, was he?

17:20.240 --> 17:21.720
He was off his medication...

17:23.960 --> 17:27.376
Being a schizophrenic doesn't
make you a murderer.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.160
And if he was off
his meds, then why?

17:31.200 --> 17:32.256
I mean...

17:32.280 --> 17:34.120
no answer's ever
that simple, is it?

17:35.680 --> 17:36.920
Look at this guy.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.320
He's doing this for
the money, right?

17:43.120 --> 17:45.840
At some point, he thought
the whole thing through.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.776
That the materials
cost next to nothing.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.016
He's got a captive customer.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.856
And the chances are someone's
going to be backwards enough

17:54.880 --> 17:56.136
to give him some loose change

17:56.160 --> 17:59.536
for throwing a bucket of
water over their windscreen.

17:59.560 --> 18:02.616
Then look at the track
marks on his arm,

18:02.640 --> 18:04.200
his eyes...

18:05.320 --> 18:09.240
most likely, that's the reason
he's doing this. To score.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.520
But go back past that...

18:14.760 --> 18:18.856
find out how he came to be
hooked in the first place,

18:18.880 --> 18:20.216
and there's the real reason

18:20.240 --> 18:23.416
he's stood out here
tap-dancing through traffic.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.480
Nah, nah. Jog on. Nah.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.736
If we could go back far enough,

18:30.760 --> 18:34.056
if we could understand why
people do what they do -

18:34.080 --> 18:37.736
if we could understand the motive -

18:37.760 --> 18:41.040
maybe we wouldn't have spent so
much time chasing our own tails.

18:42.520 --> 18:43.896
We're going to get the guy, sir.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.400
That's all that matters.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.000
And what if we let someone slip
through the cracks on our way here?

18:59.480 --> 19:02.776
Final call for Maiden
Airways Flight 386,

19:02.800 --> 19:05.240
closing now at gate number 37.

19:09.120 --> 19:12.256
It's fine, sir, they called
ahead to say you were boarding.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.600
Thank you.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.800
To the left. There you are, sir.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.440
That'll teach me to give
up the gym membership.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.760
Sorry.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.416
Look at those clouds.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.800
Good time to get away.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.080
Yes.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.680
Yes, it is.

20:04.120 --> 20:08.520
Have you been feeling less
drowsy on the new medication?

20:12.320 --> 20:15.640
And the thoughts you
have - the urges...

20:17.320 --> 20:20.040
on a scale of 1 to 10, how
do they compare since taking...

20:24.680 --> 20:26.520
Would you excuse me? I'm so sorry.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.536
Christ's sake, Jules. You've
worked here long enough

20:39.560 --> 20:41.469
not to interrupt
me during a session.

20:41.493 --> 20:43.016
I know, I know. - What is it?

20:43.040 --> 20:45.336
I just... I thought
you'd want to know.

20:45.360 --> 20:49.016
Steven Mills has been named
as the prime suspect.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.336
The police have given the
following advice to the public...

20:52.360 --> 20:54.496
Don't disturb me again.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.240
Do not approach him as he
may be armed and dangerous.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.600
Sorry about that.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.176
The teeth were removed
and the fingertips

21:12.200 --> 21:15.360
and faces burned beyond recognition
with hydrochloric acid.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.536
Our sources say the evidence
against Mr Mills is decisive,

21:19.560 --> 21:22.800
and they are expecting an
arrest within the hour.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.416
I don't know why I have to be
the one to get the damn dog.

21:32.440 --> 21:35.520
People walk their dogs in the park.
So you're walking the dog.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.656
Sorry about that.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.640
Queenie, what's the
matter with you?!

22:32.320 --> 22:34.376
Busted.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.936
I thought you quit.

22:35.960 --> 22:37.000
I did.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.001
That reported sighting of Steven

22:45.025 --> 22:47.240
Mills, in Gown Street
- false alarm.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.416
- Another one.
- Yeah.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.056
Everyone's so desperate to be the
one to find this guy, they're

22:53.080 --> 22:56.936
reading rights to every white
male in his 40s they can find.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.896
What do you think it
is about this one

22:58.920 --> 23:00.800
that's got everyone so worked up?

23:02.920 --> 23:03.960
The uncertainty.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.696
We don't know why
they're being killed,

23:07.720 --> 23:09.680
we don't even know who they are.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.400
People start to think
they might be next.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.736
Other people - they think
they're invincible.

23:18.760 --> 23:21.496
That bad things don't
happen to them.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.720
Until they turn up right
on their doorstep.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.256
She'll be here soon.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.520
Hey!

23:42.160 --> 23:43.640
Are you sure?

23:48.680 --> 23:50.720
Yeah. I'm sure.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.376
Are we there yet?

24:02.400 --> 24:03.560
I think so, love.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.920
Good girl.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.280
It's just this way.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.256
- What happened there, Mummy?
- Ali, come on.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.840
Hold my hand.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.056
I'm bored.

26:21.080 --> 26:25.056
I know, love, I know... Um...

26:25.080 --> 26:27.816
I'm sure it won't be too long now.

26:27.840 --> 26:28.880
Here...

26:32.000 --> 26:34.056
What colour shall we do the snail?

26:34.080 --> 26:36.200
- Blue!
- Course, love...

26:42.320 --> 26:44.400
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.840
I'm DCI Markham.
This is DI Shepard.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.400
Can you, um...

26:56.480 --> 26:58.496
can you tell me what's going on?

26:58.520 --> 27:00.136
You must be Ali.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.256
Did you know that we have three
vending machines around the corner?

27:03.280 --> 27:04.696
- No?
- Chocolate, crisps...

27:04.720 --> 27:06.256
Can I have one?

27:06.280 --> 27:08.176
Yeah! Mark can take you down.

27:08.200 --> 27:08.996
Bye, Mummy.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.480
I'll be right here. Go on,
love, it's going to be OK.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.696
Please, just tell me
what's happening.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.776
Because no-one is
telling me anything.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.856
I need to speak to your husband.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.976
My husband? Why?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.200
You've heard of those
murders, in the news?

27:28.120 --> 27:30.616
You're that detective. The
one who was attacked.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.856
I'm also the investigating
officer on this case.

27:33.880 --> 27:38.120
But how... how is Steven... er...

27:41.760 --> 27:44.376
You think he's involved?

27:44.400 --> 27:46.256
Steven?

27:46.280 --> 27:48.496
No, that's... that's mad.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.056
No, no way...

27:50.080 --> 27:52.400
Right now, all we want
is to talk to him, Beth.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.976
We found fingerprints at the crime
scene that match your husband's.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.336
- No...
- He's got a history of violence.

27:59.360 --> 28:02.040
No, he's on medication.
He's fine now.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.616
The officers who
brought you in tell me

28:06.640 --> 28:08.616
your phone's been
switched off for a while.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.176
He hasn't had an episode for years.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.016
So why would he suddenly just...

28:12.040 --> 28:15.056
- Beth, he has a record.
- He can't. He's just, um...

28:15.080 --> 28:17.696
It can't be... him.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.496
He's not a killer, OK?

28:20.520 --> 28:24.896
He works nine to five, he takes
Ali swimming at the weekends...

28:24.920 --> 28:29.176
Right now, Beth, all we
know is that he was there.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.176
At the crime scene. We know that.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.056
But we don't know how
he was involved,

28:33.080 --> 28:34.856
or what he was doing there.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.616
So we need to talk to
him, to understand.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.136
Maybe we can help him.

28:40.160 --> 28:44.560
And maybe he can help us.
Do you see?

28:46.080 --> 28:49.056
The officers who
brought you in tell me

28:49.080 --> 28:52.376
your phone's been switched
off all morning, yeah?

28:52.400 --> 28:57.176
Yeah, I took Ali to the
play centre, and... I...

28:57.200 --> 28:58.986
Yeah, I didn't switch
it back on because

28:59.010 --> 29:00.600
I like to have the
mornings with...

29:03.040 --> 29:05.640
- Do you have your phone now?
- Yeah.

29:22.280 --> 29:25.680
If he was there, at this crime
scene, then there was a reason.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.416
And you'll find out
when you talk to him.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.400
You'll see. He would never...

29:35.560 --> 29:38.080
He would never do
something like that.

29:45.840 --> 29:48.080
Three messages. All
from withheld numbers.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.120
Put it on speaker.

29:56.120 --> 29:57.936
Love, it's me.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.880
I... I need to speak to you.

30:01.160 --> 30:04.160
I can't use my mobile.
They might be listening.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.376
Beth, please.

30:07.400 --> 30:12.280
Beth! If you get this,
please leave your phone on.

30:18.440 --> 30:21.680
CHRIST, BETH, WHERE ARE YOU?!

30:39.960 --> 30:41.976
What is it that you want from me?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.376
Your help.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.936
We're going to sit here and
we're going to wait for him

30:45.960 --> 30:47.880
to call again, OK?

31:07.680 --> 31:09.456
Anything?

31:09.480 --> 31:11.216
Guy's clicked on some weird porn.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.120
Loads of naked women sleeping.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.416
Maybe we should pocket
these ones for Asim.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.416
Listen, we're on the job here.
We're not down the pub.

31:19.440 --> 31:22.296
And Asim wouldn't want to wear
them anyway - they're too tight.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.601
His arse has enough to cope
with, if you know what I mean.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.816
Are you bloody joking?

31:27.840 --> 31:30.136
If you lot were doing your
jobs, you'd know that

31:30.160 --> 31:33.440
I got here five minutes ago and was
through there, in the bedroom.

31:34.480 --> 31:37.320
Me and the other officers,
in silence, doing our jobs.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.976
And we heard every last word.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.456
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Hey - it was just...

31:44.480 --> 31:46.056
Don't you dare try to defend it.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.456
Or we'll see what the
Professional Standards Department

31:48.480 --> 31:51.080
thinks of it, shall we? We'll
see if they think it's a joke.

32:31.360 --> 32:34.096
Hey, you OK?

32:34.120 --> 32:36.000
Does it hurt?

32:37.200 --> 32:38.976
'Scuse me?

32:39.000 --> 32:40.440
Does your face hurt?

32:42.160 --> 32:44.456
Yeah. Sometimes.

32:44.480 --> 32:45.800
Sorry.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.896
It's OK.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.120
Gabriel!

33:03.760 --> 33:05.256
I need to see you.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.656
Why? What's happening?

33:07.680 --> 33:11.256
I can't explain. I mean...

33:11.280 --> 33:13.336
I can explain in person.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.960
You're the only one
I can trust, Beth.

33:17.440 --> 33:18.600
You're the only one...

33:20.240 --> 33:21.640
Where are you?

33:23.280 --> 33:25.616
- I'm in a playground.
- The usual one?

33:25.640 --> 33:26.976
Yeah.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.400
You with Ali?

33:31.200 --> 33:33.000
Yeah. With Ali.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.216
Good. Good.

33:36.240 --> 33:39.480
Why can't you just tell
me what's going on?

33:41.200 --> 33:43.576
You never know, do you?
You never know...

33:43.600 --> 33:46.016
who's listening.

33:46.040 --> 33:49.280
You can't... Jesus...

33:50.360 --> 33:54.576
Look, I know things have
been hard recently...

33:54.600 --> 33:56.136
Between us.

33:56.160 --> 33:59.720
And I know I've been...
distant. I'm sorry.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.816
I'm sorry for a whole
lot of things, Beth.

34:03.840 --> 34:06.816
Like, I know I always say I'm too
busy to go and see your mother,

34:06.840 --> 34:09.936
like, I don't have time, y'know?
But after all this,

34:09.960 --> 34:12.936
- we'll go and see her. OK? OK?
- Steven...

34:12.960 --> 34:15.896
Promise you'll come and
see your mother with me.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.960
And then everything'll be back
to normal. Then you'll know.

34:21.040 --> 34:23.696
Just give me a couple of hours.

34:23.719 --> 34:24.880
Yes...

34:44.880 --> 34:46.239
You did really well, Beth.

34:47.280 --> 34:50.656
We're going to do everything in our
power to bring him in peacefully.

34:50.679 --> 34:54.775
He didn't kill anyone. He wouldn't.
I know him.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.815
When he mentioned your mother,

34:56.840 --> 34:59.800
you reacted like you didn't
know what he was talking about.

35:02.720 --> 35:05.776
It doesn't mean anything,
he's just confused.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.496
And just because he's confused
doesn't mean he'd hurt anyone.

35:08.520 --> 35:09.800
Confused about what?

35:11.040 --> 35:13.040
My mother died 13 years ago.

35:14.360 --> 35:16.136
What was your mother's name?

35:16.160 --> 35:17.616
Excuse me?

35:17.640 --> 35:21.160
Steven mentioned your mother. I was
just wondering what her name was.

35:23.080 --> 35:27.800
Edith. Edith Grey, my maiden name.
Why?

35:30.360 --> 35:33.760
Doesn't matter. I'm sure
it doesn't mean anything.

36:00.480 --> 36:01.520
Did you hear him?

36:02.920 --> 36:04.040
The way he was talking.

36:05.240 --> 36:06.400
It could really be him.

36:07.840 --> 36:08.880
It's him.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.320
All this time.

36:12.960 --> 36:16.216
All this time I was so sure
it was Christine Levison.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.456
The way she acted...

36:18.480 --> 36:21.040
the fire in the station, and now...

36:22.600 --> 36:24.080
Now we're going to catch him.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.760
We're going to catch
the man who hurt you.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.240
I got your message.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.976
- So where are you going to go?
- I don't know.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.936
I've just got to get away.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.976
I should be going with you.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.256
I know, and you will.
You'll join me. OK?

37:11.280 --> 37:12.320
Why the rush?

37:15.160 --> 37:16.520
Because I can't stay here.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.176
Everywhere I look it's
on the fucking news...

37:20.200 --> 37:22.056
This guy, this Steven Mills...

37:22.080 --> 37:25.376
I know. So let me come.

37:25.400 --> 37:28.080
Not together. You know
that's not a good idea.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.776
Look.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.040
You'll join me.

37:45.080 --> 37:47.560
When I get there, I'll call.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.160
It's going to be all right.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.040
It's going to be fine.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.656
We'll need the
firearms team as well.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.896
There were reports of
shots this morning.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.840
Good work. We really
needed this break.

38:38.640 --> 38:39.920
You OK?

38:41.240 --> 38:44.296
Cos ever since you got back

38:44.320 --> 38:46.816
you've been acting like
I've done something wrong

38:46.840 --> 38:49.096
and if I have, I'd love
to know so I can...

38:49.120 --> 38:50.280
do something about it.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.360
I'll let you know when it's
time for the briefing.

39:03.680 --> 39:06.256
Boss, the warrant came through.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.720
These are Steven
Mills' health records.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.376
You OK?

39:13.400 --> 39:15.520
Yeah, sure. Just, uh,
girlfriend issues.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.336
Apologise.

39:18.360 --> 39:22.376
I don't care if it's what
you've done or what she's done.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.240
But it's the only
way you're ever...

39:25.600 --> 39:27.240
What? What is it?

39:29.120 --> 39:31.080
I don't know how I missed it.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.560
Steven Mills was one of
Isaac Taylor's patients.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.480
Um... bottle of still
water, please.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.640
Must knacker you out,
all that cleaning.

41:10.520 --> 41:15.600
Our skin sheds around ten
million cells a day.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.616
It's left over benches and door
handles, shopping trolleys,

41:20.640 --> 41:22.976
cash machines...

41:23.000 --> 41:26.216
It's never-ending, people
sharing their bacteria.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.640
Infecting each other.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.696
I try not to think about it.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.200
Maybe you should.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.536
Where are you?

41:53.560 --> 41:55.936
I waited outside, but
it's just too noisy.

41:55.960 --> 41:57.896
I'm inside by the doors. Call me.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.560
OK? You owe me that at least.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.280
Women, eh?

42:06.320 --> 42:08.536
An old patient, actually.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.896
Oh. Are you a doctor?

42:10.920 --> 42:12.336
Psychiatrist.

42:12.360 --> 42:15.520
Yeah. Makes sense.

42:29.360 --> 42:32.656
Just keep on using the moisturiser
as often as you can. And...

42:32.680 --> 42:34.856
You know what I'm going
to say, don't you?

42:34.880 --> 42:36.856
The Lamala clinic.

42:36.880 --> 42:39.176
I don't have time to go to France.

42:39.200 --> 42:41.696
The work they do
there is fantastic.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.856
Any other complaints? Issues?

42:43.880 --> 42:44.920
Um...

42:46.160 --> 42:47.800
I'm having trouble swallowing.

42:48.920 --> 42:53.296
Would you say that's all the time,
or just when eating and drinking?

42:53.320 --> 42:56.536
Eating. Sometimes. I don't know...

42:56.560 --> 42:59.256
That could be the scar tissue
tightening around the neck.

42:59.280 --> 43:02.336
Which is a good thing, because
it means it's healing,

43:02.360 --> 43:05.280
but there are other things
that we can do to help...

43:07.600 --> 43:09.696
- Markham.
- They've found another body.

43:09.720 --> 43:11.096
On my way.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.856
I have to go.

43:12.880 --> 43:14.856
Gabriel, you can keep
on getting better.

43:14.880 --> 43:17.256
I can help you with that. But
you've got to help me too.

43:17.280 --> 43:18.837
You've got to commit
to some of these

43:18.861 --> 43:20.336
treatments that
we're offering you.

43:20.360 --> 43:23.440
I'll get better when I catch the
fucker who did this to my face.

43:46.080 --> 43:47.936
Well, it's not the
same as the others.

43:47.960 --> 43:50.995
For a start, we're
not in a playground.

43:51.019 --> 43:52.016
No shit.

43:52.040 --> 43:55.016
The victim was killed before the
acid was poured on his body

43:55.040 --> 43:57.816
but victim's throat
was slit this time.

43:57.840 --> 44:00.056
And it looks like the
killer was interrupted.

44:00.080 --> 44:02.440
No time to move the body.

44:05.040 --> 44:08.336
We got an anonymous tip reporting
gunshots in the vicinity.

44:08.360 --> 44:11.816
So maybe someone heard something,
came in and disturbed our killer.

44:11.840 --> 44:15.496
They take a few shots, and then
run. Killer made a mistake, though.

44:15.520 --> 44:19.256
In the rush, left something behind.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.336
The acid compound.

44:21.360 --> 44:23.936
Forensics are running it now.
Fingerprints.

44:23.960 --> 44:26.880
- I think this might be it.
- Let's hope so.

44:30.760 --> 44:32.800
Fumes are making me feel sick.

44:56.040 --> 44:57.080
You've quit?

44:58.600 --> 44:59.640
For good this time.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.096
Right.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.080
Listen, we should probably talk.

45:09.800 --> 45:12.280
You sure you wouldn't rather
do that over a drink?

45:14.760 --> 45:16.720
You know what happens
if we do that.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.480
And what's wrong with that?

45:31.920 --> 45:34.480
I'm sorry. It's time.

45:35.880 --> 45:39.896
I know. Yep, it's time.

45:39.920 --> 45:42.456
Maybe it's been time for a while.

45:42.480 --> 45:45.056
I should probably get my key back.

45:45.080 --> 45:47.496
Of course. It's at the station.

45:47.520 --> 45:49.320
I'll give it to you later.

45:50.920 --> 45:54.456
I'm going to question Christine.
She's the only suspect we've got.

45:54.480 --> 45:56.856
I'll get started on the
paperwork down at the station.

45:56.880 --> 45:59.400
I'll call you as soon as I
hear anything from forensics.

46:15.160 --> 46:16.656
Do you fancy a cake?

46:16.680 --> 46:18.616
Not really. Do you?

46:18.640 --> 46:20.456
No.

46:20.480 --> 46:23.160
Yeah, you do. That's
why you asked me.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.600
You want me to have one
so you can have one.

46:27.960 --> 46:31.085
Well, go on, you can
still have one, you know.

46:31.109 --> 46:32.136
Nah.

46:32.160 --> 46:34.096
You are ridiculous.

46:34.120 --> 46:36.080
Hey. Not in here.

46:37.640 --> 46:41.576
What? Afraid your dad might
walk in? Someone we work with?

46:41.600 --> 46:44.680
Someone you once went to
school with 15 years ago?

46:46.000 --> 46:48.816
- What are you so afraid of?
- I'm not ready to tell people.

46:48.840 --> 46:50.240
Why can't you just let it be?

46:53.600 --> 46:55.880
All right, fine. See you
back at the station.

46:57.400 --> 46:59.176
I thought we were going together.

46:59.200 --> 47:03.320
Yeah, well, get a bus. And find
somewhere else to sleep tonight.

47:11.760 --> 47:13.240
You can't stay away, can you?

47:15.160 --> 47:16.400
You know me, Christine.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.336
Nothing else better to do.

47:19.360 --> 47:21.056
So when's the operation?

47:21.080 --> 47:22.936
Today.

47:22.960 --> 47:25.176
Operation number...

47:25.200 --> 47:27.936
Christ, I've lost count.

47:27.960 --> 47:29.896
Contracture issues on my eyelids.

47:29.920 --> 47:31.816
Needs another skin graft.

47:31.840 --> 47:34.696
Maybe they'll take the
skin from my arse.

47:34.720 --> 47:36.880
One way to tighten that
bastard up, right?

47:38.360 --> 47:42.576
There's been another body. I've
just come from the crime scene.

47:42.600 --> 47:43.396
So?

47:43.420 --> 47:45.880
So, you're still a
suspect in this case.

47:46.960 --> 47:48.560
I'm in hospital.

47:49.760 --> 47:51.644
The charge nurse
tells me you signed

47:51.668 --> 47:53.296
out at 7:50 and back in at 9am.

47:53.320 --> 47:55.640
I had an emergency.

47:57.160 --> 48:00.376
What emergency? You were
here for an operation.

48:00.400 --> 48:03.336
Where did you have to be
that was so important?

48:03.360 --> 48:05.680
I had a call from my mum.
She needed my help.

48:06.720 --> 48:09.536
She called, needing money,
and by the time I got there,

48:09.560 --> 48:10.680
bastard didn't show.

48:12.680 --> 48:14.296
Heard from her since?

48:14.320 --> 48:15.360
No.

48:17.760 --> 48:20.816
I didn't kill those people, and
I didn't do that to your face.

48:20.840 --> 48:22.896
I don't know how many times
you want me to say it.

48:22.920 --> 48:25.400
Just saying it isn't
enough, Christine.

48:29.840 --> 48:32.216
That's a plainclothes
police officer.

48:32.240 --> 48:35.056
He's here to make sure you don't
go on any more day-trips.

48:35.080 --> 48:37.616
Do you know why I went to prison?

48:37.640 --> 48:39.416
I read the police report.

48:39.440 --> 48:42.920
I was 15. Some dickhead my
mum was screwing around on.

48:44.280 --> 48:46.720
He realised what she was
up to, got drunk and...

48:48.600 --> 48:50.216
did it for payback, he said.

48:50.240 --> 48:52.376
Thought that if he messed
her face up like that,

48:52.400 --> 48:54.096
no-one else would want her.

48:54.120 --> 48:56.336
He was right. Sent
her over the edge.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.680
Put her on the hard stuff.

48:58.920 --> 49:01.456
Now no-one'll touch
her with a bargepole.

49:01.480 --> 49:04.696
The look on his face, though,
when I did it back to him...

49:04.720 --> 49:06.200
You enjoy it then, did you?

49:07.600 --> 49:09.856
Some psychiatrist once
told me I did what I did

49:09.880 --> 49:12.776
because I wanted to turn
him into a monster.

49:12.800 --> 49:14.336
So that he could
look more like me -

49:14.360 --> 49:17.016
because that's what I
look like on the inside.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.181
He also said I was
a "narcissist with

49:19.205 --> 49:21.176
unfulfilled
psychopathic ideation"

49:21.200 --> 49:22.760
so what does he know?

49:28.160 --> 49:30.896
Point is, I had a
reason for what I did.

49:30.920 --> 49:33.160
This lot you're talking about?
It wasn't me.

49:34.520 --> 49:35.880
We're ready.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.376
Good luck with your operation.

49:42.400 --> 49:45.136
It's good to know you've got
my best interests at heart.

49:45.160 --> 49:48.120
I don't. I just don't want
you taking the easy way out.

49:52.200 --> 49:53.680
Don't let her out of your sight.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.456
Markham.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.776
We've got a hit on the
fingerprints found at the scene.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.576
His name's Steven Mills.

50:02.600 --> 50:05.536
Works as a contractor in Stratford.
Married, one kid.

50:05.560 --> 50:07.656
He's a history of
mental health issues -

50:07.680 --> 50:10.096
he was arrested 15 years
ago for violent behaviour.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.520
Where can we find him?

51:04.480 --> 51:06.096
That's really good, love.

51:06.120 --> 51:08.400
Now let's get Mummy a coffee.

51:33.920 --> 51:35.480
Do you think Daddy will like it?

52:46.280 --> 52:48.440
- What's this?
- I made you coffee.

52:54.520 --> 52:56.776
- That's good.
- Thanks.

52:56.800 --> 52:58.736
You're still grounded, though.

52:58.760 --> 53:00.416
For how long?

53:00.440 --> 53:02.016
You're lucky it's not for life.

53:02.040 --> 53:03.416
I've said I'm sorry.

53:03.440 --> 53:05.016
I know that. But it's not enough.

53:05.040 --> 53:06.656
But how long for?

53:06.680 --> 53:08.800
Dad, please. I'm
sorry, you know I am.

53:09.840 --> 53:10.880
Six weeks.

53:12.200 --> 53:14.976
That's so long. Mum?

53:15.000 --> 53:16.040
Six weeks.

53:17.520 --> 53:20.096
You can't play me and your
dad off against each other.

53:20.120 --> 53:21.760
You can try. But you'll fail.

53:24.640 --> 53:26.816
Now, come on, breakfast.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.280
Shit. I'm late.

53:29.320 --> 53:30.960
Wait.

53:32.280 --> 53:34.416
Have an amazing day, Dad.

53:34.440 --> 53:35.520
Still six weeks.

53:42.240 --> 53:44.480
Wait - you can have
this on the way.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.120
Is that for me?

53:51.200 --> 53:54.120
You're going to speak
to her today, then?

53:55.880 --> 53:59.256
- Yeah.
- Like you were going to yesterday?

53:59.280 --> 54:01.136
When the time's right,
I'll talk to her.

54:01.160 --> 54:04.560
You end your affair with that
woman today. Or we're over.

54:05.960 --> 54:08.840
- Do you understand?
- I said I would and I will.

54:10.280 --> 54:13.200
And don't speak to me like I'm
the only guilty person here.

55:05.640 --> 55:09.160
You're not going to
let me live, are you?

55:32.400 --> 55:34.080
I'm sorry...
