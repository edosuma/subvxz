THERE'S A NEW BOOK

NOT DOING WELL
IN EUROPEAN HISTORY.

00:38.367 --> 00:40.600
THAT'S WHY I'M
NOT DOING WELL.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.000
I DON'T HAVE
ANY HANDS-ON
EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.300

09:46.600 --> 09:47.834
I LEFT HALF
THE TEST BLANK.

09:47.834 --> 09:49.600
THAT COULD HURT YOU.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.834
YEAH. I SHOULD
HAVE JUST TAKEN
THE ANSWERS

09:51.834 --> 09:54.200
WHEN TORIE
OFFERED THEM TO ME.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.800
THAT WAS THE END
OF A VERY GOOD STORY.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.600
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
TO TELL ME THE REST?

09:59.600 --> 10:00.867
I DIDN'T TAKE
THE ANSWERS

10:00.867 --> 10:03.033
BECAUSE IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN CHEATING.

10:04.367 --> 10:06.233
YEAH.

10:06.233 --> 10:09.567
SHE WANTED SOMETHING
FROM ME IN EXCHANGE.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.000
WHAT?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.700
ME.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.600
OHH.

10:16.967 --> 10:18.000
STUPID!

10:18.000 --> 10:19.500
STUPID! STUPID!
STUPID! STUPID!

10:19.500 --> 10:20.500
GENTLEMEN...

10:20.500 --> 10:24.100
OUT OF SOME
MORBID CURIOSITY,

10:24.100 --> 10:27.033
I WAS ANXIOUS TO SEE
HOW YOU DID ON YOUR TESTS.

10:27.033 --> 10:29.934
MR. MARSDEN,
YOU RECEIVED A "B."

10:29.934 --> 10:31.100
A "B"! A "B"!

10:31.100 --> 10:32.400
I GOT A "B"!

10:32.400 --> 10:33.600
YES, MR. MARSDEN,

10:33.600 --> 10:35.233
AND NOW THAT
YOU'VE ACHIEVED IT,

10:35.233 --> 10:36.967
I DON'T EXPECT
ANYTHING LESS.

10:38.767 --> 10:42.400
YOU KNOW,
YOU TAKE THE JOY
OUT OF EVERYTHING.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.100
THANKS.

10:46.100 --> 10:49.500
MR. MATTHEWS,
YOU EARNED AN A-MINUS.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.100
I THINK YOU OWE

10:52.100 --> 10:55.700
A DEBT
OF GRATITUDE
TO MISS HART.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.300
YEAH...

10:57.300 --> 10:58.600
I OWE HER SOMETHING.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.734
HEY, TORIE.

11:01.734 --> 11:03.467
HOW DO YOU GET
AN A-MINUS

11:03.467 --> 11:05.600
WHEN YOU LEAVE
HALF THE TEST BLANK?

11:05.600 --> 11:09.567
THAT HELPED.
I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO
MUCH ERASING.

11:09.567 --> 11:11.700
I DIDN'T WANT
TO DO IT THIS WAY.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.400
WHICH WAY?

11:13.400 --> 11:14.500
THIS WAY?

11:14.500 --> 11:16.200
I WANTED TO
EARN THE GRADE

11:16.200 --> 11:18.500
TO PROVE
I WAS SMART.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.900
WHY? YOU'VE GOT
SO MUCH ELSE
GOING FOR YOU.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.100
YOU'RE CHARMING,
YOU'RE FUNNY,

11:23.100 --> 11:25.500
YOU'VE GOT THESE
KISSABLE LITTLE DIMPLES--

11:25.500 --> 11:28.767
HEY. YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN EARN A GOOD GRADE

11:28.767 --> 11:30.133
BY MYSELF, DO YOU?

11:30.133 --> 11:34.834
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER
YOU SET YOUR CUTE
LITTLE MIND TO.

11:34.834 --> 11:37.600
I'M JUST LIKE
SOME OBJECT TO YOU, HUH?

11:37.600 --> 11:41.300
YOU THINK I'M A BIMBO?

11:41.300 --> 11:44.200
I AM NOT A BIMBO.

11:48.767 --> 11:52.700
HEY, HOW COME YOU GUYS
GET A COUCH?

11:54.033 --> 11:55.700
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.100
IT'S LIKE NEW.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.934
IT'S BETTER. ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS MY BIKE?

11:59.934 --> 12:02.767
CHECK THE SERIAL NUMBER.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.000
IT'S FILED OFF.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.233
I DID THAT FOR YOU.

12:09.867 --> 12:13.734
THERE SEEMS TO BE
A DECIMAL PROBLEM
WITH THIS BILL.

12:13.734 --> 12:14.967
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

12:14.967 --> 12:17.667
I'M SAYING $1,500?
THAT'S NUTTY!

12:17.667 --> 12:19.400
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO TAKE IT UP

12:19.400 --> 12:20.567
WITH OUR COMPLAINT
DEPARTMENT.

12:20.567 --> 12:21.867
I WOULD!

12:21.867 --> 12:23.300
WHAT!

12:26.233 --> 12:27.767
HEY. MR. TURNER.

12:27.767 --> 12:30.100
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
MY UNCLE MIKE
WOULD DO YOU RIGHT?

12:30.100 --> 12:31.600
HE'S DOING ME
RIGHT NOW.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.300
UNCLE MIKE. I CAN'T
TAKE MY EYES OFF YOU

12:39.300 --> 12:40.400
FOR ONE SECOND?

12:42.400 --> 12:44.100
THAT IS
A LEGITIMATE BILL.

12:44.100 --> 12:47.567
"LABOR--1,600 HOURS."

12:47.567 --> 12:49.800
IT SURE SEEMED LIKE IT.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.934
UNCLE MIKE, THIS GUY
IS MY TEACHER.

12:52.934 --> 12:56.567
YOU HURT HIM,
I HURT YOU.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.600
IS THAT A THREAT?

13:00.600 --> 13:02.500
YEAH. IT IS.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.000
MY BROTHER'S SON.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.600
O.K., PROFESSOR.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.867
$300. SUDDENLY,
I'M A MAN
OF MY WORD.

13:13.867 --> 13:16.867
I JUST WISH
YOUR MOTHER WAS
ALIVE TO SEE THIS.

13:17.934 --> 13:19.500
SHE IS.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.500
OH. I SHOULD
GIVE HER A CALL.

13:24.767 --> 13:26.867
IT'S MIDNIGHT,
MY SON IS STUDYING.

13:26.867 --> 13:29.100
HE'S ACTUALLY
READING A BOOK.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.800
WHERE'S THE GIRL?

13:30.800 --> 13:33.100
THERE ARE NO GIRLS.
THERE ARE NEVER ANY GIRLS.

13:33.100 --> 13:34.767
THERE ARE NO BABES
IN HISTORY.

13:34.767 --> 13:36.400
YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY'D DO TO ONE?

13:36.400 --> 13:38.100
BURN HER
AT THE STAKE.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.600
DOPES.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.000
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.800
I GOT TO GO.
I GOT A GIRL.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.767
[RING]

13:55.767 --> 13:56.967
HI, ERIC.

13:56.967 --> 13:58.767
HOW'D YOU KNOW
IT WAS ME?

13:58.767 --> 14:00.500
A GUY WHO WANTS
TO GO TO EUROPE

14:00.500 --> 14:02.133
THE NIGHT
BEFORE THE TEST?

14:02.133 --> 14:04.467
LUCKY GUESS.
WHAT'S UP?

14:04.467 --> 14:07.734
I'M STUDYING,
AND THERE'S MORE
MATERIAL THAN I THOUGHT.

14:07.734 --> 14:10.133
I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD HELP ME FOCUS

14:10.133 --> 14:12.567
ON THE AREAS
I'LL NEED FOR THE TEST.

14:12.567 --> 14:13.467
O.K.

14:13.467 --> 14:14.500
ALL RIGHT.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.033
1--D.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.667
2--L.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.300
3 IS X--

14:19.300 --> 14:21.367
I DON'T
WANT THE ANSWERS.

14:21.367 --> 14:23.200
I WANT YOU
TO HELP ME STUDY.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.834
I'VE SEEN THIS TEST.
IT'S TOUGH.

14:25.834 --> 14:27.767
YOU DON'T THINK
I'LL DO WELL?

14:27.767 --> 14:30.200
I THINK YOU'LL NEED
A LITTLE HELP.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.500
WHAT IF I STUDY
ALL NIGHT?

14:32.500 --> 14:34.567
ERIC, IF YOU WANT
TO GO TO EUROPE,

14:34.567 --> 14:37.400
I DON'T SEE
ANY OTHER WAY.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.867
WRITE THEM DOWN.
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DECIDE NOW.

14:39.867 --> 14:43.800
O.K.? 1 IS D...

14:43.800 --> 14:45.300
2--L...

14:45.300 --> 14:48.200
3--X...

14:48.200 --> 14:51.300
4--M...

15:05.667 --> 15:08.300
THERE HE IS,
MR. EUROPE!

15:08.300 --> 15:10.300
YOU DIDN'T TELL
US YOU'RE DOING
MUCH BETTER.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.900
I DIDN'T DO MUCH.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.934
MR. FEENY SAID
YOUR AVERAGE CAME UP
A FULL GRADE.

15:14.934 --> 15:16.233
I GUESS IT DID.

15:16.233 --> 15:19.200
THOUGHT A GUY
GOING TO EUROPE
COULD USE THIS!

15:19.200 --> 15:21.600
I KNOW WE WERE TOUGH
ON YOU, SWEETHEART,

15:21.600 --> 15:24.100
BUT WE KNEW
YOU COULD DO IT.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.667
YOU SHOWED US
WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.567
YEAH. THIS IS
REALLY NICE,

15:28.567 --> 15:29.600
BUT I DON'T
DESERVE THIS.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.600
I REALLY DON'T
DESERVE THIS.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.233
YOU WORKED HARD.
YOU SHOULD FEEL
GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.

15:34.233 --> 15:37.200
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT
MYSELF AND MY SCHOOLWORK.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.467
I FEEL SO GOOD ABOUT
MYSELF AND MY SCHOOLWORK,

15:39.467 --> 15:43.300
I'M GOING BACK THERE NOW.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.967
HEY, MR. FEENY.

15:51.967 --> 15:54.934
SOMETHING I CAN DO
FOR YOU, MR. MATTHEWS?

15:54.934 --> 15:58.567
UM, YEAH. I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU

15:58.567 --> 16:00.100
ABOUT SUMMER SCHOOL.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.500
WHAT ABOUT IT?

16:06.934 --> 16:09.133
YOU KNOW THE TESTS
I'VE BEEN TAKING

16:09.133 --> 16:11.967
WHERE SUDDENLY
I WAS DOING
SO MUCH BETTER,

16:11.967 --> 16:13.967
IT WAS TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE?

16:13.967 --> 16:15.767
WAS IT?

16:15.767 --> 16:17.934
O.K. O.K.
I FEEL BETTER.

16:17.934 --> 16:18.934
THANKS.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.900
CHAIR!

16:25.400 --> 16:27.000
I CHEATED, MR. FEENY.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.467
I HAD THE ANSWERS
TO THE TEST

16:28.467 --> 16:31.000
WRITTEN ON MY HAND.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.500
AND YOU ONLY MANAGED
AN A-MINUS?

16:33.500 --> 16:37.867
I SNEEZED OFF
A COUPLE OF THE ANSWERS.

16:39.367 --> 16:42.934
ALL RIGHT,
WHO GAVE YOU THE ANSWERS?

16:42.934 --> 16:46.667
OH. UH, WHY WOULD YOU
HAVE TO KNOW THAT?

16:46.667 --> 16:49.233
BECAUSE TWO PEOPLE
ARE INVOLVED IN THIS,

16:49.233 --> 16:51.734
AND IF I PUNISH TWO
INSTEAD OF ONE,

16:51.734 --> 16:55.500
I GET A BONUS
AT THE END OF THE WEEK.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.133
A GUY IN YOUR CLASS
LAST YEAR.

16:58.133 --> 17:00.667
HE SOLD ME
THE ANSWERS.

17:00.667 --> 17:03.200
WHY DID YOU DO THIS,
MR. MATTHEWS?

17:03.200 --> 17:06.000
I REALLY WANTED
TO GO TO EUROPE,

17:06.000 --> 17:09.200
AND I GUESS I SAW
MY TRIP SLIPPING AWAY.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.567
THAT'S SUPERFICIAL,
MR. MATTHEWS.

17:11.567 --> 17:14.667
PERHAPS IT'S SOMETHING
A LITTLE DEEPER?

17:14.667 --> 17:17.834
THERE IS NO DEEPER
WITH ME, MR. FEENY.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.300
I'M NOT A GOOD STUDENT.

17:19.300 --> 17:23.000
I'M AN AVERAGE GUY
WHO GETS BY
WITH A NICE SMILE.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.834
I'M NEVER GOING
TO GET AN "A,"

17:25.834 --> 17:28.600
NEVER GOING
TO MAKE THE HONOR ROLL.

17:28.600 --> 17:29.834
THAT'S WHO I AM!

17:29.834 --> 17:31.667
JUST ACCEPT IT.
I HAVE.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.200
THE ONLY THING
THAT LIMITS YOU,
MR. MATTHEWS,

17:34.200 --> 17:36.100
IS YOUR LAZINESS.

17:36.100 --> 17:38.500
YOU'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR AN EXCUSE

17:38.500 --> 17:39.834
TO NEVER GET THE GRADES

17:39.834 --> 17:42.133
I KNOW YOU'RE CAPABLE
OF GETTING.

17:42.133 --> 17:45.000
I'M NOT CAPABLE. AND
THEY'RE JUST GRADES.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.767
JUST GRADES?

17:46.767 --> 17:47.900
OH. WELL.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.133
IT'S JUST EUROPE.
AND THEY'RE JUST GIRLS.

17:53.133 --> 17:55.100
AND IT'S JUST A BEACH,

17:55.100 --> 17:57.734
UNLESS YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
THAT ON THAT BEACH

17:57.734 --> 18:01.500
IN JUNE OF 1944,
150,000 TROOPS LANDED

18:01.500 --> 18:04.200
AND BEGAN THE LIBERATION
OF EUROPE...

18:04.200 --> 18:05.567
SO THAT 50 YEARS LATER

18:05.567 --> 18:09.100
THOSE GIRLS COULD
RUN AROUND ON THAT BEACH
IN FREEDOM.

18:09.100 --> 18:12.600
1944. THAT WAS "Q."

18:12.600 --> 18:15.200
I PUT "L."

18:15.200 --> 18:16.734
AM I INTERRUPTING?

18:16.734 --> 18:18.467
AH, MISS HART.
PLEASE COME IN.

18:18.467 --> 18:20.867
IN A WAY,
THIS INVOLVES YOU.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.300
IT DOES?

18:22.300 --> 18:25.000
YES. MR. MATTHEWS JUST
DROPPED BY TO CONFESS

18:25.000 --> 18:27.600
THAT HE HAS BEEN CHEATING
ON HIS TESTS.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.100
HE HAS...

18:29.100 --> 18:31.734
YES. AND SINCE
YOU'VE BEEN TUTORING HIM,

18:31.734 --> 18:32.734
I ASSUMED--

18:32.734 --> 18:34.867
DID HE SAY
I GAVE HIM THE ANSWERS?

18:34.867 --> 18:37.900
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
MR. MATTHEWS CLAIMED--

18:37.900 --> 18:39.467
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU,
ERIC.

18:39.467 --> 18:41.400
I JUST TRIED
TO HELP YOU.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.567
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

18:43.567 --> 18:44.800
I DIDN'T.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.000
I THINK THE QUESTION,
MISS HART,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.500
IS HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO HIM?

18:53.500 --> 18:56.867
I DIDN'T THINK
HE COULD PASS THE TEST.

18:56.867 --> 18:59.233
OH? WHY NOT?

18:59.233 --> 19:02.667
YOU SEE NO POTENTIAL
IN HIM AS A STUDENT?

19:02.667 --> 19:06.367
I JUST DON'T THINK
HE'S THE STUDENT TYPE.

19:06.367 --> 19:08.200
I SEE.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.567
AND ARE YOU
THE TEACHER TYPE...

19:12.567 --> 19:15.734
OR THE TYPE THAT JUST
WRITES PEOPLE OFF?

19:15.734 --> 19:18.100
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I DIDN'T LIKE YOU.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.133
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
DON'T RESPECT HIM.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.667
THIS IS WHAT I GET
FOR SELECTING A PRETTY GIRL

19:26.667 --> 19:27.967
AS A TEACHING ASSISTANT.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.767
EXCUSE ME?

19:29.767 --> 19:31.867
OH, YOU RESENT THAT? HM?

19:31.867 --> 19:34.500
BECAUSE GROWING UP
WITH A PRETTY FACE,

19:34.500 --> 19:36.000
YOU HAD TO WORK
TWICE AS HARD

19:36.000 --> 19:37.400
TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY?

19:37.400 --> 19:41.233
YOU MORE THAN MOST
SHOULD WANT TO HELP HIM

19:41.233 --> 19:44.700
HAVE HIS CHANCE
AT BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

19:46.800 --> 19:50.600
ARE YOU FIRING ME,
MR. FEENY?

19:50.600 --> 19:52.934
DID YOU LEARN SOMETHING
TODAY, MISS HART?

19:52.934 --> 19:55.200
YES, SIR. I DID.

19:56.900 --> 19:59.100
WELL, THEN, YOU CAN GO.

20:06.033 --> 20:08.900
SO HOW COME
YOU DIDN'T FIRE HER?

20:08.900 --> 20:11.967
I DON'T WRITE PEOPLE OFF.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.500
YOU'RE A GOOD TEACHER,
MR. FEENY.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.967
YES. AND YOU'RE SMARTER
THAN YOU LOOK.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.767
I LOOK FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH YOU

20:22.767 --> 20:24.934
IN SUMMER SCHOOL.
