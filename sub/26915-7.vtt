Because I am going camping.

Exactly. We usually go in warmer weather,

raise a barn to shelter the harvest.

And at the end of the day,
when the barn was finished,

one of the children was missing.

she ran away to the city

14:46.302 --> 14:48.053
Safe and sound.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.306
-Ethan, you okay?
-Yeah.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.642
-Embarrassed, but good.
-[all chuckle]

14:53.726 --> 14:55.311
Did Speedy scare you?

14:56.645 --> 14:59.023
He must've jumped the fence,
come to find me.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.276
Well, it's okay. He's a cool dog.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.821
A cool wolf, you mean?

15:06.155 --> 15:07.573
[chuckles]

15:07.656 --> 15:10.576
[laughter]

15:12.119 --> 15:14.371
-[Billy] You charged up your phones?
-[Skye] Yup.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.206
-[Billy] Flashlights?
-[Olivia] Check.

15:16.498 --> 15:21.086
And I brought some extra batteries
because you never know.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.547
Mom, we know it's just a story.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.050
But it's a fun one, you gotta admit it.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.386
[stammers]
Uh, Billy, you got the name right, huh?

15:29.470 --> 15:31.639
-[Olivia] It's...
-It's the Autumn Ghost.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.807
Don't you worry, it's not angry or bitter.

15:33.891 --> 15:34.850
Okay.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.728
This is gonna be
an awesome ghost night.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.816
Awesome ghost night.
Awesome ghost night.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.818
It's an awesome ghost night.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.447
[owl hooting]

15:53.911 --> 15:54.787
Ooh.

15:58.540 --> 16:02.836
[sighs] So, people say
that the Autumn Ghost

16:02.920 --> 16:06.882
used to love coming here
to visit her ancestors.

16:07.341 --> 16:12.179
They say she would come after school
to visit her great-grandparents,

16:12.262 --> 16:14.640
her great-great-grandparents...

16:15.182 --> 16:18.060
Great-great-great-grandparents?

16:18.143 --> 16:19.311
[Skye laughs]

16:19.395 --> 16:20.896
[Billy] Exactly.

16:21.271 --> 16:25.192
The people who used to live here long ago.

16:27.528 --> 16:28.362
Oh, no.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.990
Good thing you brought
those extra batteries.

16:31.073 --> 16:31.907
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.995
Oh, that's weird.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.080
At least my...

16:41.333 --> 16:43.585
[Billy] What are the chances?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.046
Know what I'm thinking?

16:46.130 --> 16:48.007
-Exactly what I'm thinking?
-Yeah.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.550
[all] Back to the tent!

16:49.633 --> 16:51.927
Oh, my gosh! Oh, oh, oh.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.097
[owl hooting]

16:55.180 --> 16:57.725
[wind howling]

17:04.273 --> 17:05.149
[beeps]

17:05.232 --> 17:06.400
Shh, shh!

17:06.483 --> 17:08.402
-What?
-You heard something?

17:09.528 --> 17:11.280
I thought I heard a footstep.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.533
Did you?

17:17.494 --> 17:19.163
Nah, no.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.541
Aunt Courtney and I used to hear
"sounds" in the night.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.585
That's why we never made it through.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.713
-But I thought I grew out of that.
-[chuckles]

17:27.796 --> 17:29.673
[ghostly voice] Billy.

17:29.757 --> 17:34.136
Why did you always leave?

17:34.219 --> 17:36.472
[stammers] Autumn Ghost?

17:36.555 --> 17:37.806
No, no, no.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.685
Wait a second. I know that voice.

17:42.603 --> 17:43.437
You do?

17:44.396 --> 17:45.397
You do?

17:46.231 --> 17:47.941
[ghostly wailing]

17:50.527 --> 17:52.905
-[wailing]
-[all gasp]

17:52.988 --> 17:54.782
Courtney, you made it!

17:57.076 --> 17:58.368
-Courtney?
-Courtney?

17:58.452 --> 18:02.498
Or maybe I'm the Autumn Ghost
disguised as Courtney.

18:02.581 --> 18:06.668
Oh, nice try! We were just about to go out
and look around some more.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.546
I'm not going back out there.
It's freezing.

18:10.422 --> 18:11.507
[both chuckle]

18:14.259 --> 18:18.055
Friendly. Friendly. Friendly.

18:19.848 --> 18:22.267
-Come here.
-Still a ghost, though.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.561
Okay.

18:27.815 --> 18:31.276
-Let's stick together.
-You're not leaving my sight.

18:37.908 --> 18:43.497
Autumn Ghost, where are you?

18:44.623 --> 18:48.043
I'm gonna walk around a bit.
I'll meet you back at the tent.

18:48.544 --> 18:52.339
Hey, girls, thanks for coming.
This is fun!

18:55.467 --> 18:59.429
Fun? This is her idea of fun?

19:01.390 --> 19:04.059
-That is one strange--
-Shh!

19:04.893 --> 19:06.145
[howling]

19:06.228 --> 19:08.605
I think I hear something.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.318
That would be my heart...

19:13.402 --> 19:15.112
beating out of my chest.

19:16.029 --> 19:18.699
-You're funny.
-Not a joke.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.325
[Olivia whimpers] Oh, gosh!

19:23.036 --> 19:24.496
[Skye sighs]

19:26.832 --> 19:28.750
How is it that you're not scared?

19:29.334 --> 19:34.173
I like being with my mom.
I think she's really happy that we came.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.843
And I think the Autumn Ghost
is happy that we came, too.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.888
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.973
I think she loves visitors.

19:43.432 --> 19:48.270
Wouldn't you want a visitor
after a hundred years? [shudders]

19:48.353 --> 19:53.483
When you put it that way, I guess
I'm maybe, kinda, hope we see her.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.989
Autumn Ghost? Are you here?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.824
Autumn Ghost?

20:01.533 --> 20:02.701
[both scream]

20:02.784 --> 20:05.120
[panting, whimpers]

20:05.204 --> 20:06.455
Are you guys okay?

20:06.538 --> 20:07.372
Oh!

20:09.833 --> 20:12.461
It was just... a pumpkin.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.380
[sighs]

20:16.381 --> 20:17.674
Do you feel that?

20:17.758 --> 20:19.801
It's kind of dropped in temperature, no?

20:19.885 --> 20:22.179
I do feel a little chilly.

20:22.679 --> 20:27.851
We could stay here overnight, you know,
waiting for the Autumn Ghost,

20:28.644 --> 20:32.522
or we could go home like sane people.

20:33.273 --> 20:37.903
And make popcorn,
watch a movie about ghosts.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.405
Under a blanket.

20:43.408 --> 20:46.536
Oh, I vote for going home.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.331
Hey, just like Aunt Courtney and me.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.750
We never even made it through the night.

20:51.833 --> 20:54.336
-Oh, come on guys.
-Come here, you two.

20:54.836 --> 20:55.963
-So brave.
-[chuckles]

20:56.046 --> 20:57.756
Okay, come on, let's go.

20:57.839 --> 20:58.674
Yep.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.384
[Billy] Let's get Aunt Courtney.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.596
[creepy music playing on TV]

21:04.680 --> 21:06.306
-[Skye] We're back!
-[Olivia] Hi.

21:06.390 --> 21:11.520
Well, so, how was camping out,
waiting for a ghost?

21:11.770 --> 21:14.690
You're probably thinking
we were scared out of our minds,

21:14.773 --> 21:17.526
totally bailed
and we're scared like chickens.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.236
Ah, pretty much.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.363
Yeah. [chuckles]

21:21.446 --> 21:24.700
The legend says that sometimes
the ghost doesn't appear at all.

21:25.742 --> 21:27.369
We'll try next year, right?

21:27.452 --> 21:28.787
Uh, not next year.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.872
Not the year after.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.875
So, how did the corn maze go?

21:34.376 --> 21:35.502
Good.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.379
No one got lost, did they?

21:37.462 --> 21:39.715
-[girls] Uh...
-Long story.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.216
[laughter]

21:41.300 --> 21:42.384
Okay.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.595
-Popcorn's ready.
-Ah!

21:45.679 --> 21:47.472
Monsters of the Corn!

21:47.556 --> 21:49.641
[cheering]

21:49.725 --> 21:51.101
Boo!

21:51.977 --> 21:53.770
[laughter]

21:53.854 --> 21:54.896
Okay.
