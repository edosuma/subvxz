00:04.080 --> 00:05.920
Hey, Mrs. Forman.
Hey, Red.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.400
Hello, boys.
You're up bright and early this morning.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.320
Yeah.
We're going to Funland!

00:11.400 --> 00:13.840
It's super fun!

00:13.880 --> 00:17.040
Oh, Red, remember how we used
to take Eric there when he was little?

00:17.120 --> 00:19.800
Remember how I used to get on
the roller-coaster with him...

00:19.880 --> 00:23.120
and then, just before we took off,
I'd jump out and wave good-bye?

00:24.920 --> 00:26.840
Boy, did he scream.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.600
Well, it sounds like fun.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.520
Super fun!

00:31.600 --> 00:34.840
And we figured Eric could use some fun,
you know, since he and Donna broke up.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.840
- What?
- Broke up?

00:36.920 --> 00:39.720
Yeah, I heard Donna
dumped his ass.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.320
That's funny.
I heard Eric was the one who dumped Donna.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.760
- Sure, he did.
- Yeah, right.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.440
Well, Eric must be just a wreck.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

01:10.200 --> 01:13.520
Fine.
I'll just listen to A.M.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.960
That's just cruel.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.380
Come on, Forman.
Get out of bed.

02:09.460 --> 02:12.660
Yes, we have to go to Funland
before all the fun is gone.

02:14.140 --> 02:16.060
I'm not going.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.500
- Geez.
- Forman, man, snap out of it.

02:28.580 --> 02:32.420
So you had one of the hottest chicks
in Point Place and you blew it.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.500
Could be worse.

02:37.980 --> 02:40.100
No, it couldn't.

02:40.180 --> 02:42.260
Eric, it's not all bad.

02:42.300 --> 02:45.140
Think about Bob being
your father-in-law.

02:45.180 --> 02:49.060
That guy'd be in all
your wedding pictures.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.860
Guys, I don't want
to talk about Donna...

02:52.900 --> 02:55.300
and I don't want to go to Funland.

02:55.380 --> 02:57.540
Fine. If you're not going with us,
we'll stay here with you.

02:57.620 --> 02:59.540
We're not going to Funland?

03:05.700 --> 03:07.580
Don't...

03:07.620 --> 03:09.700
touch the G.I. Joes.

03:16.380 --> 03:19.460
- Hey, Eric, did you...
- Hey, buddy, can we not talk?

03:21.060 --> 03:22.980
Thanks.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.620
Fine.
We're going to Funland.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.460
Good. Go.

03:31.540 --> 03:34.340
You know what?
I'm glad you are not going to Funland...

03:34.420 --> 03:37.020
because you will suck the fun
right out of it.

03:38.980 --> 03:42.780
And then... And then it would
just be called "Landland."

03:45.700 --> 03:48.740
I'm sorry. I'll get you
a candy apple, okay?

03:55.380 --> 03:58.700
Okay, okay, I got Eric out of bed.
He's on his way down.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.580
Now remember,
don't say anything about Donna.

04:01.660 --> 04:03.540
He'll talk
when he's ready.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.580
Okay.

04:17.820 --> 04:21.100
Gee, Son, you look like
you've just been dumped.

04:30.780 --> 04:32.740
I wasn't dumped, okay?

04:33.700 --> 04:35.580
We broke up.

04:35.620 --> 04:38.580
Yeah, well, run it off.

04:44.860 --> 04:47.820
Do you want to
talk about it, honey?

04:47.900 --> 04:49.420
No.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.380
Okay.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.540
Are you sure?

04:54.620 --> 04:57.980
Yes. Yes, I'm sure.

04:58.060 --> 05:01.820
Okay. Let's not talk.

05:07.700 --> 05:12.540
Eric, you are a handsome young man
with a lot to offer.

05:12.620 --> 05:15.060
Okay.
Can I go now?

05:15.100 --> 05:17.580
No, no, no.
Not until you eat.

05:17.660 --> 05:19.780
You look like you
haven't eaten for a week.

05:19.860 --> 05:23.020
Oh, come on, Kitty.
He always looks like that.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.940
Well, maybe so.

05:25.020 --> 05:28.500
But he won't have the strength
to get over Donna if he doesn't eat.

05:28.580 --> 05:30.500
Fine!

05:32.260 --> 05:34.180
I'll eat.

05:35.740 --> 05:37.620
Just no more
talking about Donna.

05:37.700 --> 05:41.660
For one minute,
I'd like to not...

05:41.740 --> 05:43.580
think about Donna.

05:43.660 --> 05:46.260
No Donna.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.380
- Red, you should go talk to him.
- What?

06:14.940 --> 06:16.780
Why me?

06:16.860 --> 06:19.860
Because I don't really know
how to mend a broken heart.

06:21.260 --> 06:23.300
I've never been dumped.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.820
Oh, I don't believe that.

06:31.860 --> 06:33.780
Why not?

06:35.380 --> 06:38.140
Well, there are certain things
about you that are annoying...

06:39.420 --> 06:44.340
that other people might not
have been as tolerant of.

06:44.380 --> 06:47.060
You're bald!

06:50.140 --> 06:52.180
See? Like that!

07:02.260 --> 07:05.140
Okay, Michael,
we have to stay together.

07:05.180 --> 07:09.060
Every time we come here
you get lost.

07:10.660 --> 07:13.740
Damn, Jackie,
there's fun around every corner.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.420
Michael, what are the rules?

07:17.500 --> 07:22.140
Uh, no hitting you from
behind with the bumper cars.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.860
And?

07:23.940 --> 07:26.140
And...

07:26.220 --> 07:29.180
no riding the goats
at the petting zoo.

07:31.020 --> 07:33.140
And?

07:33.220 --> 07:36.900
- We have to stay together, Michael!
- Fine!

07:36.980 --> 07:38.980
- Balloons!
- Stay!

07:40.540 --> 07:42.420
Hey there, kids!

07:42.460 --> 07:47.820
I'm Woofy, the Funland Dog, and I'm here
to make sure that you have fun, fun, fun!

07:48.780 --> 07:50.620
Touch me like that again...

07:50.700 --> 07:53.020
you're gonna eat your Alpo
through a straw, straw, straw!

07:53.100 --> 07:54.940
Oh. Okeydokey.

07:55.020 --> 07:59.380
Well, I'm going down to the saloon
to look for the guy who shot my paw.

08:03.620 --> 08:07.700
Oh, my God!
That was Woofy, and he talked to us!

08:09.940 --> 08:13.140
Guys, we gotta pick a place to meet
in case we split up.

08:13.180 --> 08:17.020
How about the corner
of Fun Street and Fun Boulevard?

08:17.100 --> 08:20.260
I mean, that should be easy enough
for even Michael to remember.

08:22.540 --> 08:24.820
Michael?

08:24.860 --> 08:28.020
- Great. Now we'll never find him.
- Sure we will.

08:28.060 --> 08:31.620
All we have to do is show people his picture,
and they'll help us find him.

08:31.700 --> 08:34.340
You have a picture
of Kelso in your wallet?

08:35.620 --> 08:38.460
Of course.
I carry pictures of all my friends.

08:40.860 --> 08:43.380
You're friends
with Nipsey Russell?

08:44.380 --> 08:47.340
I want to be.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.660
I know he's in there.
Go talk to him.

08:49.740 --> 08:52.180
- I don't want to.
- Fine.

08:52.260 --> 08:57.260
But when I broke up with Archie Wilkins,
he lived with his parents until he was 40.

08:59.660 --> 09:01.860
Good God, Kitty.

09:01.940 --> 09:04.180
That's another 23 years!

09:05.340 --> 09:07.220
All right.
I'm going in.

09:08.860 --> 09:10.700
Hey, Eric.

09:10.780 --> 09:12.660
How you doin'?

09:14.780 --> 09:17.620
Dad, I'm really not
in the mood for conversation.

09:17.660 --> 09:20.700
Good. Then I'll talk
and you listen.

09:21.860 --> 09:24.060
I ever tell you the story...

09:24.140 --> 09:27.100
about Larry "No Foot" Mulligan?

09:30.100 --> 09:32.900
Well, I can guess.

09:32.980 --> 09:34.860
He had no foot?

09:34.940 --> 09:39.740
Larry was a buddy of mine
who lost his foot during the war.

09:39.820 --> 09:43.340
And then, on his way
back to the States...

09:43.420 --> 09:45.260
ol' One Foot...

09:45.340 --> 09:48.620
at that point
we were calling him One Foot...

09:48.700 --> 09:51.100
had his ship go down...

09:51.180 --> 09:53.660
and a shark
ate his other foot.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.620
But he made it
all the way back home.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.900
And do you know what happened to him
when he got here?

09:59.980 --> 10:02.740
He overcame his handicap...

10:02.780 --> 10:05.340
and, ironically,
became a shoe salesman?

10:12.700 --> 10:14.540
No.

10:14.620 --> 10:16.500
His girlfriend dumped him.

10:21.380 --> 10:25.300
Well, thank God
it had a happy ending.

10:26.740 --> 10:31.460
Look, the point of the story is,
you've got both feet.

10:32.820 --> 10:34.660
You'll be fine.

10:34.740 --> 10:38.220
Now, put some shoes on,
go on down and trim the hedges.

10:39.660 --> 10:43.820
Yeah. Well, you know,
I think I'm just gonna stay up here.

10:43.900 --> 10:47.460
Yeah. Well, you know,
I think you're <i>not.</i>

10:49.660 --> 10:51.940
Hi.
Have you seen him?

10:52.020 --> 10:53.900
His name is Kelso.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.740
Kelso's trapped in a box?

11:00.860 --> 11:04.060
Hey!
Fez, check it out.

11:05.180 --> 11:07.020
"Fun University."

11:07.100 --> 11:08.980
Now check out the back.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.860
"F.U."

11:19.980 --> 11:21.900
I don't get it.

11:23.460 --> 11:25.460
F.U., man.

11:26.540 --> 11:28.460
F.U.!

11:34.620 --> 11:37.660
Oh, right.
"Fu."

11:39.420 --> 11:42.700
That's a good one.
That's a good one.

11:42.780 --> 11:46.460
I tried to look for Michael,
but I can't see over the crowd.

11:46.540 --> 11:50.300
I wish Donna was here.
She's a giant.

11:51.260 --> 11:53.100
Don't remind me.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.980
I asked her and asked her and asked her
to come, and she just kept saying...

11:56.060 --> 11:58.060
"Get out of my bathroom, Fez!"

12:00.180 --> 12:02.980
Well, we still have to find Michael.
What time is it?

12:03.060 --> 12:06.100
Did someone ask
what time it is?

12:06.180 --> 12:09.900
Why, here in Funland,
it's always "Fun o'clock!"

12:19.580 --> 12:21.540
Yeah, yeah,
thanks a lot, you morons.

12:27.460 --> 12:30.620
Hey, you guys wouldn't happen
to know what time it is, would you?

12:34.300 --> 12:37.620
Oh, yeah!

12:40.700 --> 12:44.060
Rock on!

12:44.140 --> 12:45.980
I thought we were in love.

12:46.060 --> 12:47.980
Oh, God.

12:49.620 --> 12:52.420
And then it all
just blows apart.

12:52.500 --> 12:56.500
And all that's left
is this big hole, you know?

12:56.540 --> 12:58.580
Uh, no, I don't.

12:58.660 --> 13:01.860
Oh! But there is
a gopher hole out back.

13:01.940 --> 13:04.940
And if you shove the hose down
and flush him out...

13:05.020 --> 13:08.700
I'll stand at the other end
and hit him in the head with a shovel.

13:08.780 --> 13:12.460
Uh-huh.
Just go, Dad.

13:12.540 --> 13:14.420
Thanks.
Thank you.

13:19.820 --> 13:24.500
Well, I see sunshine outside,
but I don't see sunshine inside.

13:24.540 --> 13:26.660
Wanna talk about
the breakup, Bambi?

13:26.740 --> 13:30.500
No, Dad, I don't
want to talk about it.

13:30.580 --> 13:32.420
You know, we were happy.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.340
But he had to push me.

13:34.420 --> 13:37.220
He had to define everything
and get his little ring on me.

13:37.300 --> 13:41.100
By the time it was over,
we weren't even together anymore.

13:42.820 --> 13:44.700
I'm fine.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.260
Son of a bitch.

13:47.340 --> 13:50.140
Listen, when you're done...

13:50.180 --> 13:53.380
I know, I know.
Put the bags on the curb.

14:02.620 --> 14:06.020
- Hey.
- "Hey"?

14:06.100 --> 14:08.660
Is that all you have
to say to me?

14:08.740 --> 14:13.060
Well, what do you
have to say to me?

14:13.140 --> 14:14.980
Huh.

14:15.060 --> 14:17.380
How about this?
"Hey."

14:17.460 --> 14:20.180
- I'm not wrong!
- You <i>are</i> wrong, you dill-hole!

14:20.220 --> 14:23.860
Oh, great. That's nice.
That's really mature.

14:23.940 --> 14:26.060
Double dill-hole!

14:27.940 --> 14:29.860
"Double dill-hole"?

14:35.420 --> 14:41.020
Oh, geez! You were outside.
You were happy.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.300
Why are you back in bed?

14:44.940 --> 14:46.780
Well, I guess all
that fresh air...

14:46.860 --> 14:49.460
got me thinking
that I'd rather be in bed.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.340
Yeah, well, get up.
It's time to go to work.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.340
Fine.

14:56.420 --> 14:59.460
Oh, and, uh, you don't have
to worry about that gopher.

14:59.540 --> 15:01.740
It's as dead
as you and Donna.

15:05.020 --> 15:06.940
Too soon, huh?

15:20.340 --> 15:22.220
I can't believe you two.

15:22.260 --> 15:27.020
Poor Michael is lost, and all you've done
is gone on rides and have fun.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.980
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
The Funland Princess!

15:33.140 --> 15:35.020
The Funland Princess?

15:35.060 --> 15:37.660
I haven't been
on that ride yet.

15:42.940 --> 15:46.420
So, I figured this is the lost and found
and I lost my friends...

15:46.500 --> 15:49.340
so they're bound to show up here
sooner or later.

15:51.740 --> 15:53.660
Right?

15:54.900 --> 15:56.940
I miss my friends.

15:58.340 --> 16:00.180
"I miss my friends."

16:00.260 --> 16:02.980
- What?
- "What?"

16:03.020 --> 16:05.220
- Stop it.
- "Stop it."

16:05.260 --> 16:07.540
- Stop copying me!
- "Stop copying me!"

16:09.660 --> 16:11.740
- I'm stupid.
- You're stupid.

16:11.820 --> 16:13.700
Damn it!

16:20.460 --> 16:24.020
Hey, how about
that new cashier at work?

16:24.100 --> 16:25.980
Not bad, huh?

16:26.060 --> 16:28.500
Single too.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.500
- Dad, I'm not...
- What?

16:32.580 --> 16:34.500
Is it the braces?

16:34.580 --> 16:36.460
Well...

16:36.500 --> 16:39.820
you know what helps a fella
get over a gal?

16:39.860 --> 16:42.740
Pimiento loaf.

17:03.620 --> 17:06.660
What happened here, Red?
I thought you were gonna help him.

17:06.700 --> 17:09.900
Kitty, I yelled at him all day.

17:10.940 --> 17:13.500
I don't know
what else to do.

17:13.579 --> 17:16.900
Well, how did you get through
your first breakup?

17:16.980 --> 17:18.940
What's to get over?

17:19.020 --> 17:21.859
It happened.
I took it like a man.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.300
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

17:30.660 --> 17:32.540
Oh, Eloise.

17:34.820 --> 17:37.660
Oh, Eloise!

17:41.380 --> 17:43.260
My life is over!

17:52.700 --> 17:55.900
Yup.
Took it like a man.

18:03.340 --> 18:05.740
<i>That</i> was
the House of Mirrors?

18:05.820 --> 18:08.700
I have more mirrors
than that in my purse.

18:11.180 --> 18:13.060
Why is everyone leaving?

18:13.140 --> 18:15.980
Oh, my God.
What time is it?

18:16.940 --> 18:19.940
Did someone ask
what time it is?

18:20.020 --> 18:23.060
Yeah, we know.
It's fun o'clock. Get killed.

18:23.140 --> 18:27.500
No, it's closing time, kids.
Time for you to go.

18:27.580 --> 18:30.620
But, Woofy,
we still haven't found our friend.

18:30.700 --> 18:35.140
Yeah? Well, golly gee, that's just too...
Come on! Get out!

18:36.620 --> 18:38.900
Except for you!

18:43.980 --> 18:46.580
- All right. Let's go.
- What about Michael?

18:46.660 --> 18:49.460
Look, there's been lost dogs
who've traveled hundreds of miles...

18:49.540 --> 18:51.860
to be reunited
with their families.

18:51.940 --> 18:54.740
Now, Kelso
is not as smart as that...

18:54.820 --> 18:58.500
but I'm sure he can make it
the 12 miles back to Forman's.

19:01.620 --> 19:05.220
So, me and this girl Eloise
were together for a while.

19:05.260 --> 19:07.140
Everything was great.

19:07.180 --> 19:11.420
But when things started getting serious,
she dumped me.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.980
Man, that...
that hurt like hell.

19:16.980 --> 19:19.060
- Did you cry?
- No!

19:20.780 --> 19:23.020
No, no.

19:23.100 --> 19:27.260
But there were times when I thought
I would never get over it.

19:28.540 --> 19:31.100
But time passed.

19:31.180 --> 19:33.700
I moved on.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.820
And then the day came when
I didn't think about her as much.

19:36.900 --> 19:40.860
Then a couple more days came along,
and, why, I thought about her even less.

19:42.060 --> 19:45.420
Then one day,
I didn't think about her at all.

19:46.380 --> 19:48.580
And then <i>that</i> made me sad.

19:52.020 --> 19:55.220
We've got a little Irish in us,
don't we, Dad?

19:56.460 --> 19:58.380
Yes, we do.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.780
It's just...

20:03.860 --> 20:06.180
It hurts.
You know?

20:10.060 --> 20:13.380
Listen, I'm gonna give you a few days
to pull yourself together.

20:14.540 --> 20:18.460
You can stay in bed and sleep.
Watch TV.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.540
Whatever you need to do.

20:22.660 --> 20:24.540
Thank you, Dad.

20:25.660 --> 20:27.500
And, you know...

20:27.580 --> 20:30.940
not that it matters,
but Donna didn't dump me.

20:32.140 --> 20:34.180
I broke up with her.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.380
Whatever you need to tell yourself
to make it better.

20:41.280 --> 20:44.440
Thanks a lot for the ride,
Mrs. Anderson.

20:44.520 --> 20:47.040
Hey, Einstein,
you gonna eat that ice cream?

20:47.120 --> 20:49.840
My name's not Einstein.

20:49.920 --> 20:53.240
It's Kelso.
And, yeah, I'm gonna eat it.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.080
That's it.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.120
Get out!

21:01.200 --> 21:03.480
- They started it!
- Get out!

21:05.560 --> 21:08.080
See ya, Einstein.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.000
It's not Einstein!
It's Kelso!
