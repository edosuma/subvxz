WEBVTT

00:00.206 --> 00:01.741
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.861 --> 00:04.241
You slept with him? Girl,
what is wrong with you?

00:04.260 --> 00:06.676
I think you're in a position
to become the spokesperson

00:06.696 --> 00:08.647
the foster community has been waiting for.

00:08.706 --> 00:09.857
So, you're flunking out, huh?

00:09.868 --> 00:12.352
Yeah, I can't go back unless
I want to keep taking steroids,

00:12.384 --> 00:13.991
- and I don't.
- What is that for?

00:13.992 --> 00:15.891
Oh, we used to have somebody
come play happy hours.

00:15.920 --> 00:16.687
Why, you play?

00:16.762 --> 00:19.532
Those people you almost
killed, it was the Fosters.

00:19.569 --> 00:22.909
What do you think's gonna happen if I
arrest the only family he's got left?

00:22.958 --> 00:24.936
Can we at least wait
till after the funeral?

00:24.963 --> 00:25.931
Either you comin' with me,

00:25.947 --> 00:27.658
or you ain't never gonna see me again.

00:28.653 --> 00:29.479
Let's go.

00:29.480 --> 00:32.337
Doctor: She has what we call
"stage zero" breast cancer.

00:58.706 --> 01:00.119
So, I've been doing some research,

01:00.121 --> 01:02.143
and they just published this 20-year study

01:02.150 --> 01:04.542
on women with what you have, DCIS,

01:04.580 --> 01:07.549
and the mortality rate for
women who opted for mastectomy

01:07.570 --> 01:10.453
was no less than the women who
opted for radiation and lumpectomy.

01:10.464 --> 01:12.090
Uh, okay. What does that mean?

01:12.104 --> 01:13.879
It means that a lot of people

01:13.885 --> 01:16.869
are choosing really extreme
measures when they don't have to.

01:16.870 --> 01:20.479
In fact, there are some doctors here
who recommend active surveillance

01:20.495 --> 01:22.151
over any kind of surgery.

01:22.184 --> 01:24.909
You mean, like, doing nothing?

01:24.910 --> 01:26.510
No, no, you keep a close eye on things,

01:26.531 --> 01:29.185
you have your mammograms
and your MRIs twice a year.

01:29.495 --> 01:33.101
Well, that's not exactly an
option that Dr. Kopack offered.

01:33.101 --> 01:34.668
- I don't...
- I think the point is

01:35.071 --> 01:37.610
that a lot of people
hear the word cancer and

01:37.670 --> 01:39.870
they can overreact.

01:40.032 --> 01:42.019
You know, this is not
an emergency situation.

01:42.072 --> 01:45.342
I just... I think that I'm just
feeling a little overwhelmed.

01:45.678 --> 01:48.423
I just... I can't talk
about this right now.

01:48.449 --> 01:49.606
If that's okay?

01:51.817 --> 01:53.079
We can talk about it whenever you're ready.

01:53.199 --> 01:54.089
Okay.

01:54.304 --> 01:55.646
I just...

01:57.090 --> 01:58.852
You're not alone in this.

01:59.467 --> 02:00.220
I know.

02:29.646 --> 02:30.438
Um...

02:31.475 --> 02:33.803
I'm sorry, I just... I think I feel...

02:34.483 --> 02:35.666
a little...

02:35.726 --> 02:37.494
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

02:37.877 --> 02:38.617
It's okay.

02:38.638 --> 02:40.045
I'm not trying to push you away.

02:40.045 --> 02:41.683
I know. It's really okay.

02:52.364 --> 02:53.952
"Lexi for Prexi," really?

02:53.986 --> 02:55.428
What are we, in the sixth grade?

02:55.647 --> 02:57.481
She's never even been
interested in student government,

02:57.481 --> 03:00.080
she just wants to win this
stupid popularity contest.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.163
- _
- She's supposed to be my best friend.

03:02.559 --> 03:04.014
I feel like Taylor Swift when Katy Perry

03:04.044 --> 03:05.468
- stabbed her in the back.
- Callie: What?

03:05.507 --> 03:08.341
Except in my case, Lexi didn't
just poach my backup dancer,

03:08.371 --> 03:09.533
she stole my music too.

03:09.546 --> 03:11.580
Ugh. Talk about bad blood.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.462
But you know what? It's on.

03:17.233 --> 03:18.971
Well, thanks for the sympathetic ear.

03:19.770 --> 03:21.076
Really appreciate it.

03:21.312 --> 03:23.627
(piano playing)

03:28.148 --> 03:29.490
Hey, are you busy?

03:29.499 --> 03:32.128
Uh, yeah, I'm kinda practicing.

03:32.287 --> 03:34.029
- It's late.
- Yeah. I wanna get in

03:34.050 --> 03:36.408
at least four hours a day
before my Juilliard audition.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.047
And now that I'm working at the Smokehouse,

03:38.060 --> 03:40.494
this is the only time I've got, so...

03:41.170 --> 03:42.417
What's wrong?

03:43.101 --> 03:47.263
Did... did you ever tell
anyone about what we did

03:47.534 --> 03:48.721
in Idyllwild?

03:49.685 --> 03:50.774
No.

03:53.579 --> 03:54.625
Why?

03:56.651 --> 03:57.701
Did you?

04:43.553 --> 04:45.420
All right, here we go.

04:45.463 --> 04:46.676
Dig in.

04:48.260 --> 04:50.850
So, it's not... real sausage?

04:51.349 --> 04:52.304
It's real.

04:52.424 --> 04:53.401
It's soyrizo.

04:53.457 --> 04:54.812
It's just never had a face.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.881
And can I just say how awesome it is

04:56.900 --> 04:59.225
to have some fellow vegans in the house.

04:59.277 --> 05:00.610
That's me!

05:00.769 --> 05:02.542
Vegan and loving it.

05:02.564 --> 05:05.951
Well, you guys know, every vegan
saves over 100 animals a year.

05:05.981 --> 05:07.380
I'm not gonna lie,

05:07.397 --> 05:08.546
(whispering) I miss bacon.

05:09.097 --> 05:12.309
"Love goes toward love as
schoolboys from their books,

05:12.386 --> 05:15.785
but love from love, toward
school with heavy looks."

05:16.530 --> 05:17.747
What's that supposed to mean?

05:17.777 --> 05:21.296
It means being apart from
the one you love is hard.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.201
Yeah, tell me about it.

05:26.090 --> 05:27.226
Stef: Morning everyone.

05:27.256 --> 05:28.439
Sharon: Good morning.

05:28.470 --> 05:30.109
Thank you for making breakfast.

05:30.126 --> 05:31.889
- Stef: Look at that.
- Mariana: It's vegan sausage.

05:31.890 --> 05:34.554
- Oh, that looks good...
- (coughs)

05:34.796 --> 05:37.216
(mumbles) What... is this thing?

05:37.216 --> 05:38.459
Hey, Mama,

05:38.492 --> 05:40.041
do I have to take Shakespeare?

05:40.073 --> 05:42.916
Yes, it's a requirement. Just
like your senior projects.

05:42.921 --> 05:44.736
Have you guys given any
thought to what you're gonna do?

05:44.753 --> 05:46.620
But, doesn't my audition
for Juilliard count?

05:46.638 --> 05:48.199
Sorry, doesn't work like that.

05:48.595 --> 05:52.296
I'm thinking about
doing a photo essay on...

05:53.182 --> 05:54.042
something.

05:54.162 --> 05:55.226
On something. Okay.

05:55.273 --> 05:56.995
Well, you guys better
figure it out quickly.

05:57.038 --> 05:58.384
And also you need to get a move on

05:58.389 --> 05:59.976
because I have a dentist appointment.

05:59.989 --> 06:01.370
You're all riding with
Brandon this morning.

06:01.396 --> 06:04.382
You actually expect all of
us to fit in that sardine can?

06:04.438 --> 06:05.492
You could walk?

06:05.824 --> 06:07.411
Or we could drive ourselves

06:07.445 --> 06:10.780
if anyone around here had the time
to help us log our permit hours.

06:10.806 --> 06:12.694
Okay, enough, enough.

06:12.707 --> 06:14.526
Enough. You guys get
going. Please, get going.

06:16.948 --> 06:19.499
Hey, Mariana, feel free
to clear your pla...

06:19.619 --> 06:20.641
Oh, my god.

06:20.761 --> 06:23.070
Oh, I need money for
a new wrestling uniform

06:23.190 --> 06:24.967
'cause I don't fit in the old one anymore.

06:26.141 --> 06:28.430
Uh, Jesus, you're, um...

06:29.712 --> 06:31.532
not gonna be wrestling this year.

06:32.310 --> 06:33.816
What... What... Why?

06:33.851 --> 06:36.806
Because your actions at Flintwood
have to have consequences.

06:36.850 --> 06:39.362
I thought the consequence was
not getting to go back there?

06:39.375 --> 06:41.733
You gave into peer pressure, and
you made some really bad decisions.

06:41.759 --> 06:43.447
Yeah, but I stopped taking the steroids

06:43.477 --> 06:45.540
- and I told you guys.
- Well, this is not up for discussion.

06:45.561 --> 06:48.694
And feel free to not
clear your plate either.

06:50.252 --> 06:52.321
Are you sure that's good parenting?

06:53.758 --> 06:56.517
Or, let me rephrase that question.

06:56.525 --> 06:59.688
Do you think it's a good
idea to take away from him

06:59.714 --> 07:01.366
something that he really loves,

07:01.405 --> 07:04.515
which also helps him get
that testosterone out?

07:04.533 --> 07:07.730
Mom, it's not a consequence if
it's not something that he loves.

07:07.756 --> 07:08.758
Okay.

07:09.421 --> 07:11.314
- I'm just gonna mind my own business.
- Pfft.

07:11.736 --> 07:14.107
Um, I just wanna tell you

07:14.132 --> 07:17.536
that I'm not in any rush to go on my trip.

07:17.752 --> 07:18.737
So,

07:19.086 --> 07:23.225
I'm gonna stay here and see you
through the mastectomy and recovery.

07:23.242 --> 07:25.685
And I wanna be here just
as long as I can be helpful.

07:25.707 --> 07:28.995
Sharon, we don't know that
she's having a mastectomy.

07:31.671 --> 07:33.087
She has breast cancer.

07:33.138 --> 07:37.070
She has a pre-cancerous condition
that may not turn into cancer.

07:37.083 --> 07:37.978
All right, well, you know what?

07:38.004 --> 07:40.577
When the doctor told me I had
pre-cancerous cells in my uterus,

07:40.594 --> 07:43.507
I didn't mess around. I got
a hysterectomy like that!

07:43.533 --> 07:45.030
Okay, well, there are studies now

07:45.078 --> 07:47.556
that are saying that most
hysterectomies are probably unnecessary.

07:47.568 --> 07:50.090
You know, they have a different
study every five minutes.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.129
I mean, at first they say that

07:52.249 --> 07:54.521
"Oh, red wine is the fountain of youth."

07:54.521 --> 07:56.914
And the next it's, "oh, it's liquid death."

07:56.957 --> 07:58.643
Come on, Stefanie, look,

07:59.091 --> 08:01.801
when you have cancer, you just cut it out.

08:01.844 --> 08:03.712
I really think we need
to be proactive here.

08:03.768 --> 08:06.828
Okay, and I think we need to take our time

08:06.849 --> 08:07.925
and make an informed decision.

08:07.938 --> 08:11.302
And I think that you should
go on your vacation, Mom.

08:11.342 --> 08:12.611
Have fun, yeah?

08:13.855 --> 08:16.467
I'm not gonna have any fun
till I know what the plan is.

08:16.686 --> 08:17.619
So,

08:18.893 --> 08:20.222
until then...

08:21.014 --> 08:23.806
we were wondering if we could
pull the RV into your driveway?

08:23.832 --> 08:25.996
Oh, yeah, we need to
borrow some electricity.

08:26.168 --> 08:27.755
Not quite off the grid yet, Will?

08:28.005 --> 08:30.203
- I'm looking into solar panels.
- Mmm.

08:30.323 --> 08:32.101
Oh, hey, I got something for you.

08:33.561 --> 08:35.440
- What's this?
- Cannabis oil.

08:35.441 --> 08:38.744
High in antioxidants, being used to
suppress cancers, among many other things.

08:38.783 --> 08:40.549
I take a drop under my
tongue every morning.

08:40.551 --> 08:41.532
- Do you?
- Yeah.

08:41.544 --> 08:43.515
It can also be vaporized or

08:43.635 --> 08:45.313
use it as a suppository.

08:45.765 --> 08:48.127
I've been putting it on
my elbows for my psoriasis,

08:48.148 --> 08:50.644
and look, it's just
smooth as a baby's butt.

08:52.714 --> 08:54.014
I am a cop.

08:54.310 --> 08:56.853
- You do remember that, right, Mom?
- (phone buzzing)

08:56.863 --> 08:59.139
_

09:00.051 --> 09:01.152
I'll be right back.

09:01.272 --> 09:04.698
(dialing, ringing)

09:05.038 --> 09:05.924
Mike: Hey.

09:05.954 --> 09:07.766
Hey, what, are you puking or something?

09:07.800 --> 09:11.600
Huh? Oh, no, no. I'm just...
I'm just taking a personal day.

09:12.378 --> 09:13.523
You all right?

09:13.773 --> 09:15.055
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.372
Um...

09:19.456 --> 09:21.415
So, what time is the funeral tomorrow?

09:21.416 --> 09:22.774
Uh, 3:00.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.930
I'll take Ty in after?

09:25.209 --> 09:26.117
Yup.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.006
Okay, I'll see you later.

09:28.286 --> 09:29.297
Bye.

09:36.839 --> 09:39.804
_

09:44.192 --> 09:46.562
Mariana: Finally, my legs are asleep.

09:46.682 --> 09:48.487
- (engine revs)
- Whoa!

09:49.248 --> 09:50.574
You see this guy?

09:51.030 --> 09:52.199
Hey!

09:52.889 --> 09:55.099
Hey, you nearly took my door off.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.846
Sorry, dude, I didn't see you...

09:58.018 --> 09:59.484
all. Damn.

09:59.527 --> 10:01.171
How many clowns you got in that car?

10:01.196 --> 10:02.466
- Excuse me?
- Hey.

10:02.488 --> 10:03.722
Jesus, settle.

10:04.398 --> 10:06.236
Hi, I'm Mariana Foster.

10:06.279 --> 10:07.208
You must be new here?

10:07.230 --> 10:08.998
- Yeah, I'm Nick.
- What year are you in?

10:09.024 --> 10:10.099
- Junior.
- Hmm.

10:10.289 --> 10:12.834
I'm a junior, too. And I'm
running for class president.

10:12.864 --> 10:14.521
I'd love your vote.

10:14.797 --> 10:16.119
Welcome to Anchor Beach.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.199
Come on.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.040
Need a hand?

10:33.110 --> 10:34.921
Uh, sure.

10:39.150 --> 10:40.159
Oh.

10:45.889 --> 10:47.735
- Thanks for that.
- Yeah.

10:47.984 --> 10:49.275
What are you doing?

10:49.529 --> 10:51.736
Oh, hey, I was, um, I was just...

10:51.796 --> 10:53.543
helping her with the poster.

10:53.663 --> 10:54.588
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

10:55.324 --> 10:56.821
Lexi for Prexi?

10:58.173 --> 11:01.207
Oh, and I suppose you're just helping, too?

11:01.327 --> 11:03.403
Cupcakes? Seriously?

11:03.437 --> 11:05.782
Yeah, and it's my job.

11:05.838 --> 11:07.627
I'm Lexi's campaign manager.

11:10.105 --> 11:11.155
Heard you were back.

11:11.602 --> 11:12.751
That's too bad.

11:13.581 --> 11:14.978
- Can I have one?
- All: No!

11:15.042 --> 11:16.747
Pfft. Okay, then.

11:18.565 --> 11:20.464
Well, hey, can I get your keys?

11:20.480 --> 11:23.061
I'm gonna go to Girls United
at lunch to talk to Daphne.

11:23.181 --> 11:25.520
Still don't understand why you
told her in the first place.

11:25.555 --> 11:27.392
I'm sorry, okay? I just
needed somebody to talk to.

11:27.409 --> 11:29.714
You think I don't wish
I had someone to talk to?

11:30.321 --> 11:33.415
You know, that's how secrets
stop being secret, Callie.

11:33.824 --> 11:35.035
When you tell people.

11:38.415 --> 11:39.379
Come here.

11:40.708 --> 11:41.775
What are you doing?

11:41.844 --> 11:44.391
You know my history with Hayley.
She totally stole my dance routine.

11:44.438 --> 11:45.453
Dance routine?

11:45.484 --> 11:47.506
Mariana, Emma stole my boyfriend.

11:47.566 --> 11:50.716
Uh, you do know that Hayley
stole Jesus, too, right?

11:50.720 --> 11:51.817
Yeah, from Emma,

11:51.825 --> 11:53.727
which puts Hayley and me on the same team.

11:53.775 --> 11:56.067
Look, my old friends
weren't there for me, so

11:56.110 --> 11:58.268
- I had to make new ones.
- You know what, Lexi?

11:58.659 --> 12:00.759
This election isn't a popularity contest.

12:00.806 --> 12:02.127
It's about ideas.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.024
- I have ideas.
- Oh, really, like what?

12:05.045 --> 12:08.875
Hey, Lexi, love your plan to
install composting bins in the quad.

12:08.944 --> 12:11.457
Thanks, Sally, I just
hate seeing all that waste,

12:11.478 --> 12:13.438
just like, go to waste, you know?

12:13.440 --> 12:14.489
Totally.

12:14.528 --> 12:16.619
- Hey, Mariana.
- Hi, Sally.

12:18.034 --> 12:19.665
That was my idea.

12:19.708 --> 12:20.736
Was it?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.380
I better get to class.

12:27.638 --> 12:29.535
Lexi stole our composting idea.

12:29.591 --> 12:31.893
And our Student Body President
practically endorsed her just now.

12:31.897 --> 12:33.704
You want Sally Benton's endorsement?

12:33.824 --> 12:37.271
We just have to show her
who has the real ideas, so...

12:38.982 --> 12:40.893
We challenge Lexi to a debate.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.923
And then it just disappeared?

12:45.966 --> 12:48.715
Yeah, I guess whoever put the
comment up must have taken it down.

12:48.766 --> 12:50.741
Maybe it was Brooke messing with you?

12:50.775 --> 12:52.999
She's in juvie, how would
she even get to a computer?

12:53.029 --> 12:54.940
Maybe she made her freaky boyfriend do it?

12:55.710 --> 12:58.059
Tell Brandon I didn't tell
nobody about you two at Idyllwild

12:58.071 --> 12:59.887
so he can stop being mad at me.

13:00.705 --> 13:02.361
How is it with you and him?

13:02.481 --> 13:03.905
I mean, it's hard.

13:04.592 --> 13:06.005
But, um...

13:06.628 --> 13:09.890
You know, we're friends first,
so, at least we're in it together.

13:11.998 --> 13:16.529
I think I'm going to this
comic convention thing with AJ.

13:16.572 --> 13:17.290
Oh, yeah?

13:17.298 --> 13:19.041
- You back in the saddle with him?
- No!

13:19.062 --> 13:21.412
Stop. It's not, like, a "date" date.

13:21.438 --> 13:23.224
- It's just a...
- A good idea?

13:23.245 --> 13:24.768
- 'cause he is fine.
- Shush!

13:25.113 --> 13:26.787
His grandma just died, so...

13:26.942 --> 13:28.138
Oh.

13:28.370 --> 13:29.368
That's too bad.

13:29.488 --> 13:31.653
I tried to text him to see if he
wanted me to come to the funeral,

13:31.682 --> 13:33.989
but, um, he didn't
answer. I hope he's okay.

13:34.243 --> 13:36.252
Maybe he just needs some time, you know?

13:39.440 --> 13:42.060
I mean, do you have any idea what
it's like trying to get over someone

13:42.086 --> 13:43.699
when you have to see them every day?

13:46.341 --> 13:47.864
Yeah. That must be hard.

13:47.881 --> 13:50.221
And now she's running for
Junior Class President,

13:50.286 --> 13:52.949
and her picture's plastered everywhere,
so I can't get away from her.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.641
- At least you don't have to live with her.
- What?

13:57.573 --> 14:00.279
Look, if you're this
hung up on her, just...

14:00.477 --> 14:01.807
get back together with her.

14:01.927 --> 14:04.685
I mean, it's not like there's some
insurmountable obstacle keeping you apart.

14:04.805 --> 14:07.693
I just wish there was something
else I could think about, you know?

14:09.280 --> 14:11.909
Hey, what about our senior project?

14:13.036 --> 14:15.063
- Maybe we could do something together?
- You know what I need?

14:15.407 --> 14:17.166
I need to meet someone new.

14:17.333 --> 14:20.350
I need a hottie to drop out of
the sky and turn my head around.

14:24.524 --> 14:26.143
You know what I mean?

14:31.716 --> 14:33.211
Hello?

14:33.722 --> 14:36.853
Uh, yeah, I do. I'll be right back.

14:38.031 --> 14:39.580
Are you gonna finish that?

14:39.581 --> 14:41.871
So, what else is going
on with Fost and Found?

14:42.102 --> 14:44.244
Is that lady really gonna
put all that money into it?

14:44.248 --> 14:46.331
Justina? Yeah, I think so.

14:46.346 --> 14:48.868
She wants me to do a
photoshoot next weekend.

14:48.884 --> 14:49.933
A photoshoot?

14:49.981 --> 14:51.708
- Damn.
- No, not like that.

14:51.998 --> 14:54.920
It's probably gonna just be like
her and her phone. It's low-key.

14:55.147 --> 14:59.530
She's really, really pushing
this whole role model thing.

14:59.531 --> 15:01.191
What's wrong with that?

15:01.896 --> 15:03.612
Nothing, I guess.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.462
Hey, I just thought of something.

15:07.510 --> 15:10.366
What if the person who posted that
comment was talking about Liam?

15:12.835 --> 15:15.298
So, are you, like, stalking me now?

15:15.883 --> 15:17.099
Hey.

15:17.219 --> 15:18.938
What are you doing here?

15:18.987 --> 15:21.697
Oh, my school is just around there.

15:21.703 --> 15:22.945
Oh, right.

15:23.065 --> 15:24.661
Yeah. Heh.

15:24.898 --> 15:28.217
So, is this, like, your spot?

15:28.260 --> 15:30.395
Yeah. Best break in San Diego.

15:30.432 --> 15:33.212
- You ever get out on the water?
- Me? Oh, no, no.

15:33.749 --> 15:36.498
Too busy, and... lame.

15:36.525 --> 15:39.338
You go to school on the
beach and you don't surf?

15:39.348 --> 15:41.301
- Ha. Yeah.
- You are lame.

15:41.421 --> 15:43.065
Yeah.

15:43.185 --> 15:45.717
Well, hey, if you ever
wanna, you know, learn,

15:45.749 --> 15:48.765
- I could teach you a few things.
- Okay. Uh, yeah.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.912
So, maybe sometime
that... that'd be... rad.

15:52.148 --> 15:54.461
You know surfers don't
really talk like that, right?

15:54.536 --> 15:56.402
Yeah, no, no, I... I know, I...

15:56.434 --> 15:57.950
I'm just teasing.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.758
Yeah, that would be rad.

16:02.366 --> 16:03.721
Um,

16:04.937 --> 16:06.739
all right. So, I'll see you at work?

16:06.787 --> 16:08.008
Okay.

16:11.993 --> 16:13.530
Hey, you hungry?

16:13.531 --> 16:17.234
Will made some tempeh sliders.

16:17.237 --> 16:20.087
I, uh... I'm not really
hungry. I don't wanna

16:20.108 --> 16:22.324
- ruin dinner.
- Good thinking.

16:24.196 --> 16:26.008
So, how you holding up, honey?

16:26.901 --> 16:27.708
I'm fine.

16:27.724 --> 16:30.719
You know, when Frank and I were
first married he was in the Navy,

16:30.779 --> 16:35.124
and we did that long distance
thing for three years.

16:35.189 --> 16:36.576
What was that like?

16:37.200 --> 16:38.297
It sucked.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.201
But when he did get a leave,

16:41.217 --> 16:42.669
and we had a few days together,

16:42.680 --> 16:44.508
it just made them all the more precious.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.692
And our feet barely hit the
floor, if you know what I mean.

16:47.735 --> 16:50.321
- But not that I'm encouraging that kind of thing,
- I know, Grandma

16:50.354 --> 16:52.289
I'm just saying, you know, I... Well, okay.

16:52.350 --> 16:54.871
I mean, my point is that sometimes

16:54.877 --> 16:58.441
the distance actually does
make the heart grow fonder.

16:59.650 --> 17:01.363
- Pigweed.
- Huh? What?

17:01.410 --> 17:03.972
I was out foraging and I found pigweed
growing right out there in the backyard.

17:03.993 --> 17:05.539
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:05.586 --> 17:07.098
- Huh.
- Try this.

17:07.132 --> 17:09.102
Oh, thanks.

17:10.964 --> 17:12.470
- Mmm. Yeah.
- Good?

17:12.483 --> 17:15.098
That's... awesome.

17:15.442 --> 17:17.692
Anyway, what I'm saying is

17:17.694 --> 17:21.190
that it's best just to focus
on how nice it's going to be

17:21.217 --> 17:23.092
when you do see Connor as opposed to

17:23.153 --> 17:24.726
how bad it feels when you don't.

17:24.759 --> 17:28.685
- I'll try. Thanks, Grandma.
- You bet.

17:31.105 --> 17:34.964
Well, it's nice to see that somebody
around here appreciates my advice.

17:35.502 --> 17:37.788
As opposed to my daughter, who, you know,

17:37.814 --> 17:40.369
if I say orange, she says tangerine.

17:40.380 --> 17:41.482
You know, when she was little,

17:41.515 --> 17:43.956
the only way I could ever get her to
do anything I really wanted her to do

17:43.983 --> 17:46.731
- was say, "oh, don't do that."
- Did that work?

17:49.379 --> 17:50.742
Every time.

17:51.006 --> 17:53.503
Do you actually think
someone would be that cruel

17:53.541 --> 17:55.639
to ask if you had sex with Liam?

17:55.673 --> 17:57.371
He wasn't convicted of rape,

17:57.403 --> 17:58.984
and I'm sure there are people out there

17:59.011 --> 18:01.636
who are gonna think
whatever they're gonna think.

18:02.286 --> 18:05.046
And he was my foster brother, so...

18:05.256 --> 18:07.052
Yeah, you're probably right.

18:07.116 --> 18:08.918
They're probably talking about Liam.

18:09.833 --> 18:11.543
Guess I should feel relieved.

18:11.597 --> 18:13.812
No, you shouldn't. It's sick.

18:15.937 --> 18:17.469
Of course, I did

18:17.706 --> 18:19.703
have sex with a foster brother.

18:19.823 --> 18:22.064
- Callie, don't.
- What, I did.

18:22.089 --> 18:23.944
And what if somebody does find out?

18:23.978 --> 18:25.753
We didn't do anything wrong, okay?

18:25.803 --> 18:28.076
- We really thought you were never getting adop...
- Shh!

18:28.103 --> 18:29.942
We never thought you
were gonna get adopted.

18:29.958 --> 18:33.403
Are we just telling ourselves that?
I mean, I have this huge secret.

18:33.423 --> 18:35.702
How am I supposed to
let people think that I'm

18:35.904 --> 18:38.734
- some kind of role model?
- Because you are.

18:39.413 --> 18:40.792
You are.

18:40.846 --> 18:43.050
Callie, you survived the system,

18:43.070 --> 18:45.174
and you've helped a lot of people.

18:50.565 --> 18:52.521
I think you're just afraid...

18:54.169 --> 18:58.579
To be more than the poor foster girl
with the sad story and the hard life.

18:58.699 --> 19:00.811
But that's not who you are anymore.

19:00.872 --> 19:04.677
You have the chance to be so much more.

19:05.215 --> 19:06.815
To be happy.

19:06.848 --> 19:10.331
And to go out and shine in the world.

19:11.306 --> 19:14.546
The only thing holding you back is you.

19:16.845 --> 19:19.077
And you're holding me back too.

19:22.848 --> 19:25.994
I'm sorry, I thought we
were in this together.

19:26.646 --> 19:28.784
We can't be in this together.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.726
Not if we want to move on.

19:40.604 --> 19:41.837
Yeah, come in.

19:41.838 --> 19:43.668
- Hi.
- Hi, Ma.

19:43.675 --> 19:44.979
Um...

19:45.826 --> 19:48.408
I just wanted to tell you that, uh...

19:48.768 --> 19:49.961
I've changed my mind.

19:50.081 --> 19:52.696
After a lot of consideration,
I've decided that

19:52.898 --> 19:56.784
it's really, really not a good
idea to have the mastectomy.

19:57.161 --> 19:59.688
Okay. Thanks for the update.

19:59.723 --> 20:02.519
I do think that you
should have the lumpectomy,

20:02.553 --> 20:05.948
as well as looking into other
therapies along with the cannabis oil.

20:06.068 --> 20:08.569
Like, um, you know, acupuncture,

20:08.603 --> 20:11.738
and the white light meditation,

20:11.769 --> 20:14.579
and the art of positive thinking.

20:15.037 --> 20:17.974
But I definitely don't think that
you should do anything prophylactic.

20:18.599 --> 20:19.927
I don't think so.

20:20.555 --> 20:21.993
Got it.

20:22.767 --> 20:25.650
- Thanks, Mom.
- Okay.

20:28.599 --> 20:30.967
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

20:37.068 --> 20:38.977
Well, that was a 180.

20:38.978 --> 20:41.589
Maybe she's read the research?

20:43.942 --> 20:48.286
Did you... Did you read any of
the articles that I sent you?

20:48.505 --> 20:50.925
No, but I will.

20:51.471 --> 20:54.698
I will. I just really want to
get this thing with Ty over with.

20:54.698 --> 20:57.244
After we arrest him tomorrow,

20:57.261 --> 21:00.025
I'm gonna make a decision
about what I'm gonna do.

21:01.303 --> 21:05.017
Which we will talk about.

21:05.269 --> 21:07.883
Together. I promise. Okay?

21:11.766 --> 21:14.867
(organ playing)

21:25.665 --> 21:28.254
Should we wait a bit longer?

21:28.296 --> 21:30.570
Uh, no, I don't think they're coming.

21:30.573 --> 21:33.042
- We should probably get started then.
- Okay.

21:48.630 --> 21:50.123
Hey.

21:50.593 --> 21:52.953
- Hey.
- Where'd you get the board?

21:52.953 --> 21:56.404
- Uh, it's my brother's.
- That your brother's wetsuit, too?

21:56.444 --> 21:57.654
No.

21:57.661 --> 21:59.449
No, it's...

21:59.483 --> 22:01.258
(laughing)

22:01.271 --> 22:02.992
What, you make fun of all your students?

22:03.006 --> 22:06.226
Just the most promising ones. You ready?

22:07.684 --> 22:10.145
Um...

22:10.467 --> 22:13.661
Are you sure there's not, like,
a second best break in San Diego?

22:13.688 --> 22:15.180
- (laughing)
- One that's, like, smaller?

22:15.214 --> 22:17.903
Relax. You're just gonna
practice on the shorebreaks.

22:17.950 --> 22:19.577
Come on.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.945
(sighs)

22:43.046 --> 22:45.117
Where are they, Mike?

22:48.545 --> 22:50.757
I thought they'd show up for
their grandmother's funeral.

22:50.758 --> 22:53.218
Look, Stef, I swear I didn't tip off AJ.

22:53.238 --> 22:56.822
Maybe Ty got spooked, when you brought
Olsen back in for questioning again.

22:57.514 --> 22:59.857
Look, I'm sorry. I know you're angry,

22:59.858 --> 23:01.579
and it was my idea to wait
till after the funeral,

23:01.613 --> 23:03.045
so go head, let me have it.

23:03.381 --> 23:04.793
(sighs)

23:05.290 --> 23:07.502
We'll just have to find them.

23:10.908 --> 23:11.908
That's it?

23:12.672 --> 23:14.823
Could be worse, I could have cancer.

23:15.193 --> 23:16.470
That's not funny.

23:16.511 --> 23:18.272
Stef: No, it's not.

23:19.187 --> 23:20.955
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:21.075 --> 23:22.313
Yeah?

23:23.970 --> 23:25.049
Is something going on?

23:25.050 --> 23:26.702
You okay?

23:26.960 --> 23:29.280
I'm fine. I just... I have,

23:29.313 --> 23:32.500
they call it stage zero breast cancer.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
What?

23:35.010 --> 23:37.019
What does that mean, stage zero?

23:37.020 --> 23:38.989
It means that I don't have it...

23:38.990 --> 23:41.091
yet. But, I could get it.

23:41.152 --> 23:44.533
- I don't know. It's just kinda confusing.
- Well, so...

23:44.587 --> 23:46.059
what are you supposed to do?

23:46.060 --> 23:49.043
Well, I could get a
lumpectomy and have radiation,

23:49.070 --> 23:51.201
or I could have a mastectomy.

23:51.558 --> 23:54.178
- What do you want to do?
- Well, you know me.

23:54.239 --> 23:57.079
I really don't want to sit
around waiting and wondering.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.986
I would rather just, uh...

24:00.779 --> 24:03.730
just get a mastectomy and
not have to worry about it.

24:04.873 --> 24:06.159
Sorry, Stef.

24:07.354 --> 24:09.552
Now I can get that boob
job I've always wanted.

24:09.592 --> 24:11.179
What are you talking about?
You've got great boobs.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.029
Eh, you haven't seen 'em lately.

24:13.030 --> 24:14.775
(laughing)

24:14.809 --> 24:17.518
- Did this just get awkward?
- Yeah, it sure did.

24:18.970 --> 24:20.516
I'll see you later.

24:25.323 --> 24:28.180
Mariana: Not only am I well aware
of our current parking lot crisis,

24:28.200 --> 24:31.414
but I'm already in talks with the
Vice Principal to find overflow spaces

24:31.427 --> 24:34.373
- for all of our new students.
- (applause)

24:34.970 --> 24:38.608
How do we know that you'll be able to
follow through on all these promises of yours

24:38.642 --> 24:41.903
when the Vice Principal is your own mother?

24:42.023 --> 24:46.062
Well, last year I led the entire
sophomore class on a walkout

24:46.113 --> 24:48.230
to protest against the firing
of one of our favorite teachers,

24:48.281 --> 24:50.743
and my mother re-hired him.

24:50.743 --> 24:54.373
Or, I'm sorry, were you not there for that?

24:57.827 --> 24:59.205
Mariana,

24:59.325 --> 25:01.743
what's your position on prescription drugs

25:01.768 --> 25:03.736
being sold to students at Anchor Beach?

25:03.736 --> 25:07.848
Um, well, obviously,
I mean, I'm against it.

25:07.850 --> 25:10.485
It's definitely something
that we should combat.

25:10.949 --> 25:12.448
Lexi,

25:12.568 --> 25:15.488
what's your stance on having
free condoms in the bathrooms?

25:16.019 --> 25:18.436
- (crowd gasps)
- Well, I, um...

25:18.556 --> 25:20.788
Safe sex is important,

25:20.805 --> 25:24.839
and we obviously want to prevent pregnancy,

25:24.959 --> 25:27.864
At the time, or the morning after?

25:27.984 --> 25:30.872
(crowd murmuring)

25:30.922 --> 25:33.990
Well, I can say as your
Junior Class President,

25:34.040 --> 25:36.348
- I can be trusted.
- Trusted?

25:36.468 --> 25:39.044
How can you trust someone who
stabs their best friend in the back?

25:39.071 --> 25:40.804
I did not stab you in the back.

25:40.805 --> 25:42.217
Please, you're just running against me

25:42.218 --> 25:44.183
because you're jealous I'm not
living in your shadow anymore.

25:44.221 --> 25:45.436
Lexi: Jealous of you? Get real.

25:45.485 --> 25:47.001
Emma: Okay, I think we need
to get back on topic here.

25:47.028 --> 25:49.008
Okay, and you're the one
that stabbed me in the back.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.724
Wait, how did I stab you in the back?

25:50.729 --> 25:51.837
You know what, just shut up.

25:51.853 --> 25:53.500
- No, you shut up!
- You shut up!

25:53.543 --> 25:55.625
- (both shouting)
- (whistles)

25:56.297 --> 25:58.482

26:17.717 --> 26:19.583

26:58.163 --> 27:01.714

it was just gonna be you and your

- Oh, god no, I can't take a decent selfie.

27:05.263 --> 27:07.577
- (laughs)
- Callie.

27:07.697 --> 27:10.534
Callie, you're not just an
inspiration, you're an aspiration.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.100
I mean, for foster kids everywhere.

27:12.126 --> 27:14.540
I mean, if they can see it, they can be it.

27:14.923 --> 27:16.879
So, let's show them all they can be.

27:18.176 --> 27:19.823
Okay, now, don't kill me,

27:19.857 --> 27:22.943
but I was at the mall today,
shopping for myself, I swear,

27:23.063 --> 27:26.478
and I found a few things
that would look great on you.

27:26.498 --> 27:28.871
Wouldn't this look amazing on you?

27:31.937 --> 27:33.443
What's wrong?

27:34.532 --> 27:36.072
Nothing. I love it.

27:36.966 --> 27:40.092
(both laughing)

27:47.042 --> 27:50.780
That... apparently is why I don't surf.

think this was a date?

28:13.178 --> 28:17.017
No. No, no, no, not like a "date" date.

28:17.595 --> 28:22.341
I mean, did you not think that... anything?

28:23.874 --> 28:27.357
- Well...
- Okay. Feeling like a complete idiot now.

28:27.377 --> 28:29.622
No, no, I mean...

28:29.742 --> 28:32.150
It's definitely...

28:32.520 --> 28:35.767
Um, I'm just kind of
getting out of something.

28:35.827 --> 28:37.676
You know?

28:37.716 --> 28:39.430
Yeah.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.562
I do know, actually.

28:41.898 --> 28:43.666
What's her name?

28:44.425 --> 28:46.252
Uh...

28:47.847 --> 28:50.624
I can't really talk about it.

28:50.893 --> 28:52.876
Oh, no, you're right.

28:52.916 --> 28:55.653
That's more of a second
"non-date" date conversation.

28:55.773 --> 28:58.082
(both laughing)

28:58.967 --> 29:01.312
You know, it's fine.

29:02.375 --> 29:03.935
It was mutual.

29:04.055 --> 29:07.431
We, uh... And it wasn't because
we didn't want to be together.

29:07.485 --> 29:09.312
It was... There was, um...

29:10.484 --> 29:13.375
These reasons that got in the way.

29:13.980 --> 29:18.451
And we thought the main reason went away,

29:19.170 --> 29:21.489
so we finally...

29:21.609 --> 29:23.351
Hooked up?

29:24.098 --> 29:25.200
Yeah.

29:25.214 --> 29:28.494
And then that reason came crashing back.

29:28.777 --> 29:30.988
So, you're star-crossed lovers?

29:31.042 --> 29:32.750
(chuckling)

29:33.247 --> 29:35.442
I guess you can say that.

29:35.443 --> 29:36.774
- Hmm.
- What about you?

29:36.774 --> 29:39.043
Did you really break up with someone,

29:39.060 --> 29:41.119
or are you just trying
to let me down gently?

29:41.757 --> 29:43.592
No, I, um,

29:43.593 --> 29:47.489
I did, actually, recently have a breakup,

29:47.942 --> 29:51.118
- but I'm pretty much over it.
- Wow.

29:51.152 --> 29:55.320
- How'd you do that? Any advice?
- I surf.

29:55.530 --> 29:57.295
Great.

29:57.593 --> 30:00.949
It's where I work things
out. It's in the water.

30:01.361 --> 30:03.681
And then, when I get back to my life,

30:03.731 --> 30:08.185
all of a sudden, my problems just
don't seem so problematic anymore.

30:09.849 --> 30:12.907
You must have something in your
life that makes you feel that way?

30:14.353 --> 30:16.664
Sometimes my music.

30:18.075 --> 30:20.168
Well, there you go.

30:34.453 --> 30:36.563
It's probably a sign, huh?

30:38.108 --> 30:42.411
- I'm sorry that got so ugly.
- Me too.

30:42.427 --> 30:44.158
I know you're not jealous of me.

30:44.278 --> 30:46.226
I kinda am, actually.

30:46.346 --> 30:49.041
I mean, I had to go back to Honduras

30:49.041 --> 30:51.041
and you got to stay here.

30:51.621 --> 30:53.789
I missed a whole year and w

30:54.823 --> 30:56.949
hen I got back you were different.

30:57.579 --> 31:00.251
More confident and prettier,

31:00.486 --> 31:02.805
and running for Junior Class President.

31:02.925 --> 31:05.478
I felt like everyone
had forgotten about me.

31:05.598 --> 31:09.473
- I didn't forget you.
- But you had new friends, like Emma.

31:09.593 --> 31:12.759
You know, first she
stole Jesus, and then you,

31:13.011 --> 31:15.070
and now she's your best friend.

31:15.190 --> 31:17.986
No, Emma's not my best friend.

31:18.280 --> 31:21.053
You're my best friend
and you always will be.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.506
No matter how much we change.

31:24.977 --> 31:28.499
I don't even really want to
be Junior Class President.

31:28.810 --> 31:30.885
You could always drop out.

31:32.188 --> 31:33.902
Well...

31:34.759 --> 31:36.802
I've come this far.

31:41.876 --> 31:44.137
Circus left town without you, huh?

31:44.868 --> 31:46.877
Yeah, I guess so.

31:49.061 --> 31:50.709
You want a ride?

31:52.789 --> 31:54.271
Thanks.

32:01.341 --> 32:05.080
This is sick. It's yours?

32:05.114 --> 32:07.013
Yeah, it's one of the few
perks of being an only child.

32:07.021 --> 32:09.374
I get 700 horse power all to myself.

32:09.416 --> 32:12.467
Yeah, but you don't actually
get to use it though around here?

32:12.475 --> 32:15.251
- Dude, I took it up to 120 last weekend.
- Shut up.

32:16.044 --> 32:17.778
Where?

32:17.779 --> 32:20.239
Oh my god, girl, you look amazing.

32:20.246 --> 32:21.878
(giggles)

32:21.879 --> 32:23.858
Ooh, and you're totally
smizing in this one.

32:23.859 --> 32:26.358
- Smizing?
- Smiling with your eyes.

32:26.478 --> 32:27.878
(laughs)

32:31.198 --> 32:32.518
What happened to you?

32:32.518 --> 32:34.963
She had a photoshoot for Fost and Found.

32:35.083 --> 32:37.779
Oh, so you're, like,
America's Top Foster Model now?

32:37.899 --> 32:40.653
Hey, don't be a jerk. She looks gorgeous.

32:40.773 --> 32:42.930
No, I'm sorry. I just...

32:42.964 --> 32:44.828
You don't really look like you.

32:52.165 --> 32:54.031
Mmm.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.148
- You don't get to do that.
- What?

32:58.165 --> 33:01.130
You don't get to tell me to
go out and shine in the world

33:01.156 --> 33:02.950
- and then make me feel bad.
- No, I wasn't trying to...

33:02.977 --> 33:04.537
No, you hold me back, too, Brandon.

33:04.574 --> 33:06.166
It's not just on me.

33:06.467 --> 33:09.291
No, you like me as the poor foster girl

33:09.328 --> 33:10.248
who needs you to save her.

33:10.259 --> 33:12.819
So, if you wanna move on,
if you want me to move on,

33:12.878 --> 33:14.848
do not drag me back down.

33:19.418 --> 33:20.832
Hey.

33:21.139 --> 33:22.419
You look beautiful.

33:23.075 --> 33:24.097
Thank you.

33:24.129 --> 33:25.630
You're welcome. Hey, Cal?

33:25.662 --> 33:27.012
Have you, um...

33:27.743 --> 33:31.406
You seen or heard from AJ at all?

33:31.459 --> 33:32.890
Uh, no.

33:32.933 --> 33:35.741
No, he hasn't been
answering any of my texts.

33:35.784 --> 33:38.840
- You?
- Uh, he doesn't have his phone.

33:39.293 --> 33:42.408
Um, he, uh... He took off.

33:44.226 --> 33:45.915
Why?

33:46.209 --> 33:47.873
Don't know.

33:48.075 --> 33:50.344
We think he's with his brother.

33:50.789 --> 33:53.588
Anyway, if you hear from
him, you let me know.

33:53.708 --> 33:57.000
- Yeah.

I know that you don't know what
you're going to do yet, but I...

35:16.365 --> 35:20.466
There are some things that I think
we should talk about as a couple.

35:20.491 --> 35:22.406
Like what?

35:24.104 --> 35:27.684
Well, if... if you decide that

35:28.053 --> 35:32.574
you need to do something as
aggressive as a mastectomy,

35:33.515 --> 35:36.591
from what I'm reading, after a
surgery like that, a lot of women

35:36.711 --> 35:38.322
suffer from depression.

35:38.540 --> 35:41.826
And loss of self-esteem, lack of sex drive.

35:42.650 --> 35:44.557
Mine or yours?

35:45.516 --> 35:46.715
What do you mean?

35:46.747 --> 35:49.322
You afraid you're not gonna
be attracted to me anymore?

35:49.546 --> 35:50.585
No.

35:50.705 --> 35:53.210
That's not what I'm saying at all.

35:53.566 --> 35:54.625
Okay.

35:58.576 --> 35:59.836
Honey, it's...

36:00.078 --> 36:02.247
It's major surgery.

36:02.616 --> 36:04.378
It's not like getting
implants or something.

36:04.636 --> 36:06.992
You might... You might be...

36:07.586 --> 36:08.908
Disfigured?

36:10.857 --> 36:13.089
You might not like the way you look.

36:14.606 --> 36:17.862
And in most cases it
requires multiple surgeries

36:17.882 --> 36:19.724
over a long period of time.

36:19.751 --> 36:21.963
It's not like they just cut
them off and it's done with.

36:24.061 --> 36:25.645
Sorry.

36:25.765 --> 36:28.655
No, I... I know.

36:31.496 --> 36:33.789
All I'm saying is

36:34.037 --> 36:39.073
why do something so drastic to your
beautiful body if you don't have to?

That's all I got so far,

37:08.896 --> 37:11.655
- but what do you think?
- A rock opera.

37:13.516 --> 37:14.705
Yeah, why not?

37:14.706 --> 37:17.811
Well, Shakespeare's pretty... intense.

37:17.818 --> 37:20.144
Well, you know, we'll edit down the play,

37:20.184 --> 37:21.972
you know, to basic story points,

37:22.092 --> 37:23.666
and we'll make all the
lyrics in modern English.

37:23.686 --> 37:26.019
Still, it sounds like a lot
of work for a senior project.

37:26.059 --> 37:27.800
Well, it'll be fun.

37:27.821 --> 37:30.503
Come on. And this will give
you a chance to pour all that

37:30.550 --> 37:33.603
heartbreak into it. You
know, like a catharsis.

37:33.845 --> 37:35.862
That's really why I thought of it.

37:35.982 --> 37:37.666
Oh.

37:38.846 --> 37:40.460
Thanks, man.

37:40.991 --> 37:42.656
No problem.

37:43.230 --> 37:44.696
I'm in.

- Let's do it.
- Okay.

37:49.022 --> 37:52.812
Nick: Yeah, it's an old factory road or
something. Nobody ever comes down here.

37:52.932 --> 37:54.487
Whoa, what are you doing?

37:54.528 --> 37:56.337
We didn't come out here
so you could ride shotgun.

37:56.457 --> 37:58.763
- But I just have my permit.
- I don't care.

37:58.965 --> 38:01.808
- Well, cops might.
- The cops don't even know this road is here.

38:01.835 --> 38:04.155

39:19.073 --> 39:21.621
your pictures are already
up on Fost and Found.

39:26.931 --> 39:30.044

you've already gotten.

39:58.117 --> 40:00.147
Well, here they are.

40:01.983 --> 40:04.047
Hey, Ma, um...

40:04.457 --> 40:07.227
I've decided to get the lumpectomy.

40:08.382 --> 40:09.854
What?

40:10.104 --> 40:12.752
No. No. No.

40:13.397 --> 40:15.045
No? Oh my...

40:15.064 --> 40:18.219
- I thought that's what you wanted me to do!?
- Well, I only told you to do that

40:18.246 --> 40:20.276
so that you would do the
opposite like you always do.

40:20.289 --> 40:21.759
That's ri... That's ridiculous.

40:21.762 --> 40:24.021
- What are you talking about?
- You never agree with me on anything.

40:24.064 --> 40:27.052
That's not true, Mom! That's not true!

40:27.084 --> 40:30.001
- You're disagreeing with me right now.
- Ma, oh my...

40:30.732 --> 40:33.944
So you used reverse
psychology on me about this?

40:34.064 --> 40:35.564
Well, it always worked
when you were a child.

40:35.589 --> 40:38.236
Okay, first of all, Mom,
I'm not a child anymore,

40:38.261 --> 40:41.161
and I don't appreciate you using
these kind of mind games on me

40:41.164 --> 40:42.347
on something that's so important!

40:42.347 --> 40:44.426
- I just wanted you to make the right decision.
- And I have.

40:44.475 --> 40:45.625
- You haven't.
- I have.

40:45.647 --> 40:47.013
- You have not, Stefanie!
- That's it, Mom.

40:47.029 --> 40:48.906
This is done! I am done!

40:49.144 --> 40:50.144
Okay.

40:50.145 --> 40:51.069
Done.

40:51.085 --> 40:54.990
I will be in the RV when you come to
your senses and decide to outlive me.

- Hey.

41:15.678 --> 41:20.426
- Anything good?
- Just, uh, bills, you know.
