How long
have you been selling?

11:28.588 --> 11:31.057
of developing the product
four years ago,

11:31.057 --> 11:32.692

last summer.

Exactly.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.758

maybe that happens.

and I have to wait
a very long time.

get back my capital

over the next year,

and maybe with the help
of a Shark,

13:31.678 --> 13:33.846

that manufacturing cost down

13:33.846 --> 13:35.815
to where there's margin
that we can go to retail.

what do you dream

basically.
Yeah.

I love this for so many reasons,

13:49.896 --> 13:51.330
but I think that
the manufacturing

13:51.330 --> 13:52.465
is going to be
your pain point

13:52.465 --> 13:55.468
'cause you have
to constantly raise.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.170
I think this is something where

13:57.170 --> 13:58.738
it's a fusion of a license,

13:58.738 --> 14:02.375
where you get somebody
to make the goods as a license,

14:02.375 --> 14:04.077
you get to sell it
online direct,

14:04.077 --> 14:06.813
and they do all
the big-box stores and all that

14:06.813 --> 14:08.014
because
they're already in there.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.348

something in here.

of a hugely successful business

which is not easy to do, right?

14:24.530 --> 14:27.433

34:29.200 --> 34:31.770
and he's crying
'cause now he can't eat it.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.105
And I was like,
"There has to be a better way."

34:34.105 --> 34:35.840
I thought, "Why don't
we just have a nice cake

34:35.840 --> 34:37.542
that we don't
have to assemble?"

34:37.542 --> 34:38.910
And I thought it'd be
a lot more fun

34:38.910 --> 34:40.245
if there was
a story to go with it.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.180
And what is included
in your little packet?

34:42.180 --> 34:44.115
So, each set comes
with the baking pan

34:44.115 --> 34:45.750
and the gnome and the book.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.986
And what do you sell it for,
and where do you sell it?

34:47.986 --> 34:49.754
I sell it online.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.256
It's $60 per set.

34:51.256 --> 34:52.390
That's pretty pricey,
do you think?

34:52.390 --> 34:53.592
What's it cost you
to make?

34:53.592 --> 34:54.926
$15 a set.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.028
And so tell us about
the company, the sales.

34:57.028 --> 34:59.230
I launched October 7th
of last year.

34:59.230 --> 35:02.100
I ended up selling out
all 5,000 sets

35:02.100 --> 35:04.002
that I was able to have
in my inventory.

35:04.002 --> 35:05.203
Really?
And how quick?

35:05.203 --> 35:07.172
In 35 days.
Wow.

35:07.172 --> 35:09.107
That's great.
Congrats.
And how did you get
the customers?

35:09.107 --> 35:11.776
I had a static-graphic
Facebook ad that I ran.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.612
It just said
"A new Christmas tradition,"

35:13.612 --> 35:15.246
and people
just clicked the link.

35:15.246 --> 35:17.215
You said 5,000 units.

35:17.215 --> 35:18.350
I don't know
if you discounted them.

35:18.350 --> 35:19.951
What was
the dollar amount?

35:19.951 --> 35:24.789
Right. I did $200,000 in that
35-day period when I ran the ad.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.257
And how much
did the ad cost?

35:26.257 --> 35:28.827
I believe it was
about $40,000.

35:28.827 --> 35:29.961
That's not bad.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.930
That's a profitable return
on ad spend.

35:31.930 --> 35:34.666
Did you have a history
in online?

35:34.666 --> 35:36.668
No, not at all.
I've been a stay-at-home mom

35:36.668 --> 35:39.571
for the last eight years
and homeschooled my kids.

35:39.571 --> 35:40.905
What is
your background?

35:40.905 --> 35:44.609
Well, one interesting part
that has sort of made me

35:44.609 --> 35:45.977
a little Christmas-obsessed

35:45.977 --> 35:49.814
is I left a religious cult
that I was raised in.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.883
We didn't celebrate holidays
growing up.

35:51.883 --> 35:53.652
We didn't celebrate birthdays,
Christmas,

35:53.652 --> 35:56.521
Mother's Day, Father's Day,
and so, after I left,

35:56.521 --> 35:58.790
I was able to experience
Christmas for the first time.

35:58.790 --> 36:01.626
I just really was
so amazed.

36:01.626 --> 36:03.428
I was blown away
at how magical it is,

36:03.428 --> 36:04.929
and it's just so beautiful.

36:04.929 --> 36:06.531
And so,
when I had my own kids,

36:06.531 --> 36:09.000
I wanted to just really
immerse them in, like,

36:09.000 --> 36:10.335
all of the traditions.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.903
I mean, I see this
being something

36:11.903 --> 36:13.705
that could be
the next Elf on the Shelf.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.007
It could blow up
into a tradition

36:16.007 --> 36:17.609
that everyone wants
to take part in.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.277
The book has had rave reviews,

36:19.277 --> 36:20.912
and kids absolutely love it.

36:20.912 --> 36:21.980
It's a great gift item.

36:21.980 --> 36:22.947
It is such a good gift.

36:22.947 --> 36:24.416
Did you write
this book yourself?

36:24.416 --> 36:26.384
I wrote it
and illustrated it.

36:26.384 --> 36:28.787
You're hot stuff, really.
You've done it all.

36:28.787 --> 36:29.921
John: You know,
I'm curious.

36:29.921 --> 36:32.023
I want to know
what your expectations are

36:32.023 --> 36:35.260
on the participation of
the Shark, besides money.

36:35.260 --> 36:38.730
I want mentorship.
I am really creative.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.532
I'd love to come up
with another concept

36:40.532 --> 36:41.866
that branches off of this.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.401
I'd love more
of a product line.

36:43.401 --> 36:45.937
I am not a businessperson
at heart.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.472
Yeah, you could've fooled us.
You've fooled us.

36:47.472 --> 36:49.240
Vaughn: Thank you.
And how much have
you personally invested?

36:49.240 --> 36:51.109
$150,000, roughly.

36:51.109 --> 36:52.510
Ooh, that's a lot.
Where'd you get that from?

36:52.510 --> 36:54.946
Yeah,
we mortgaged the house...
Damn.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.381
...took a loan against the car.
O'Leary: Whoa.

36:56.381 --> 36:57.916
You and your partner,
husband?

36:57.916 --> 36:59.484
It's all been paid back.
Yeah.

36:59.484 --> 37:02.921
Look, I think it's so simple,
so eloquent, such an easy story.

37:02.921 --> 37:05.957
I get it.
I'd do the deal for 25%,

37:05.957 --> 37:07.392
and the way it works is

37:07.392 --> 37:10.095
when you take out a dollar,
I get 25 cents.

37:10.095 --> 37:12.130
And you don't have to
take out a dollar,

37:12.130 --> 37:14.165
but at some point,
you have to pay yourself,

37:14.165 --> 37:15.834
and I want
to get paid, too.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.202
So, what do you need
the money for?

37:17.202 --> 37:19.571
I want to be able
to bulk up my inventory

37:19.571 --> 37:21.005
and financing purchase orders.

37:21.005 --> 37:23.975
If I were to get
a hard purchase order

37:23.975 --> 37:25.176
and make a deal with anyone --

37:25.176 --> 37:26.845
You don't want to sell
in retail, do you?

37:26.845 --> 37:27.979
I do.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.647
Who's asked you
to go to retail?

37:29.647 --> 37:30.982
My heart.

37:30.982 --> 37:33.084
Oh, you want to go to...
[ Laughs ] I love that.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.488
You want to go to retail
when you've got a hit online?
Oh, I know, but --

37:36.488 --> 37:38.022
That's kind of taken
a little air out for me.

37:38.022 --> 37:39.157
She's on a mission, Kevin.

37:39.157 --> 37:40.592
This is not a company.
It's a mission.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.494
She says she wants it to be
like Elf on the Shelf.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.295
Vaughn: That's the thing. It's
not just selling a cake pan.

37:44.295 --> 37:45.930
You're selling a tradition.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.433
Eventually,
if you do well enough

37:48.433 --> 37:51.903
and you start to build the name
and the legend and the brand,

37:51.903 --> 37:55.306
I see it at Valentine's Day
with a cute Valentine's house

37:55.306 --> 37:57.575
with a hidden heart
or something inside.
Yes.

37:57.575 --> 38:00.078
I see it year round,
but a fun tradition

38:00.078 --> 38:01.813
where the kids are waiting
to find the thing

38:01.813 --> 38:03.681
and they get the good luck
for that holiday.

38:03.681 --> 38:07.085
Or birthdays and just have it
be totally evergreen.
Birthdays. All of that.

38:07.085 --> 38:08.153
So, here's my offer.

38:08.153 --> 38:11.089
$200,000,
but 33.33%.

38:11.089 --> 38:14.893
I know it's steep,
but, you know, it takes work.

38:14.893 --> 38:15.894
Okay, thank you.

38:15.894 --> 38:16.928
Cuban: And I'll
clear the deck some.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.429
That's better than
I could possibly do.

38:18.429 --> 38:19.831
I'm out.
Okay, thank you.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.533
I think what you're really
looking for

38:21.533 --> 38:25.537
is a team of mentorship,
because there's nothing better

38:25.537 --> 38:28.006
than having a team of people
surrounding you.

38:28.006 --> 38:32.443
I get around my entrepreneurs,
not only one-on-one with them,

38:32.443 --> 38:33.945
but everyone
in my office

38:33.945 --> 38:35.513
knows everything
about their business.

38:35.513 --> 38:37.382
We constantly
have brainstorming.
Mm-hmm.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.884
So I would love
to make you an offer,

38:39.884 --> 38:41.719
and it's going to be
a little less greedy

38:41.719 --> 38:45.023
than Mr. Wonderful here,
and a lot less greedy...
I'm not even
the greediest.

38:45.023 --> 38:48.726
...than Mrs. Not So Wonderful
next to him, okay?
I think "The Greedette."

38:48.726 --> 38:51.996
But I'm going to offer you
$200,000 for 20%.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.766
But what I guarantee
is you will be focused,

38:54.766 --> 38:56.401
and you will find
all the right answers.

38:56.401 --> 38:59.103
And you're a phenomenal
businessperson, by the way.

38:59.103 --> 39:00.405
Don't ever say
you're not again.

39:00.405 --> 39:01.973
John: Barbara, would you
let me come in on that?

39:01.973 --> 39:04.175
If we do it for 25% --
We don't need you.
I got so many --

39:04.175 --> 39:07.011
Come on, Barbara, 25%.
I come in with it.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.981
I help with
the publishing side...
No, it's too greedy. No.

39:09.981 --> 39:12.517
...and all that good stuff.
No, no, no. No, thank you.
I don't need you.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.085
O'Leary:
So, you have three offers.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.821
Lori, would you want to
get it into retail?

39:16.821 --> 39:18.556
Is that something
that you think is a good idea?

39:18.556 --> 39:20.858
I am a believer
that we do a master plan

39:20.858 --> 39:23.895
and then we strategically
go into retail.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.330
Lori, you let me in
on your deal?

39:25.330 --> 39:28.032

I need another Shark.
