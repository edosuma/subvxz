WEBVTT

01:24.417 --> 01:25.877
Pour vous.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.978
Didn't Mom used
to put pineapples on it?

04:30.061 --> 04:31.938
I looked,
I, I couldn't find any.

04:32.021 --> 04:34.774
Well, it's going
to be perfect.

04:34.857 --> 04:38.403
Um... Let's use
the fancy glasses.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.488
Yeah?

04:54.544 --> 04:56.796
Hey!

04:58.381 --> 04:59.298
Get! Get!

05:13.896 --> 05:14.856
Hey.

05:16.315 --> 05:17.316
Just one more.

05:18.651 --> 05:19.736
That's it.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.488
Look what I
found upstairs.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.367
Oh, wow.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.536
Mom's Christmas sweaters.

05:28.619 --> 05:29.370
She kept all of them.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.873
She bought a new one
for this year.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.085
Might be Dad.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.298
Nope, it's the DA.
Won't fucking let up.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.844
-Jesus!

05:50.683 --> 05:51.350
It's your Auntie Blair. Hmm?

05:53.895 --> 05:55.188
I got it. I got it.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.072
-Good luck.
-Yes. Hello?

06:04.155 --> 06:04.947
Blair
Merry Christmas, Margie.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.366
Merry Christmas to you.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.327
Did you get to mass?

06:09.410 --> 06:10.453
No, we didn't
make it to church.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.581
-But you prayed, though.
-Yeah, we prayed.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.251
Margie, I've been thinking
about Thanksgiving,

06:17.335 --> 06:18.544
what we spoke about?

06:18.628 --> 06:19.962
This has nothing
to do with that.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.089
I don't want
to talk about it.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.882
But I've been thinking
about you girls,

06:22.965 --> 06:25.093
-about what happened
in Germany.
-You know we don't...

06:26.260 --> 06:27.970
remember Germany.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.890
Look, our ham is ready.
I got to go.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.391
-Okay. I'm here
if you need me.
-Merry Christmas.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.685
-God bless you girls.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.907
-Got it?

06:47.990 --> 06:49.325
-- Yeah.
-- It's Dad.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.080
Electronic voice:
This is a call from
the Durham County Jail.

06:54.163 --> 06:56.415
Do you accept the charges?

06:56.499 --> 06:58.334
Yes, I accept the charges.

06:58.417 --> 06:59.210
Well, isn't that
sweet of you?

06:59.293 --> 07:02.088
I cover your ass
for 25 years,

07:02.171 --> 07:04.173
and now you're finally willing
to cough up some dough.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.300
Yeah, for now.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.094
I mean, it depends how long
they keep you in there for.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.805
Has your bail posted yet?

07:10.888 --> 07:11.722
Any day now.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.975
Uh, put Margaret
on the phone, will you?

07:16.811 --> 07:20.606
-Hey, Dad.
-You guys
unwrap presents yet?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.108
Uh, no, not yet.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.818
They're not gonna
do it themselves.

07:23.901 --> 07:26.696
I know. It's just,
it's not the same without you.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.406
Honey, nothing
feels right about this.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.703
The DA keeps calling.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.246
Well, you just
keep ignoring him.

07:35.329 --> 07:40.459
So, have you spoken
to Candace or Lori?

07:40.543 --> 07:41.085
I haven't gotten through.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.713
Uh-uh, no.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.548
What? Really? Nothing?

07:45.631 --> 07:46.465
No.

07:50.845 --> 07:54.473
Look, just make sure
everyone sticks together.

07:55.474 --> 07:56.601
I miss you.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.894
I miss you, too.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.228
We all do.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.730
I'll, I'll see you soon.

08:00.813 --> 08:01.564
-Alright?
-Okay.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.066
-I love you.
-I love you.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.651
-Love you.
-Love you, Dad.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.485
Love you. Bye.

08:28.299 --> 08:31.093
Hi, you've reached Mark, Ash,
and Candace Zamperini.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.386
-Leave a message.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.806
Automated
This is a call from
the Durham County Jail.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.351
Mark, darling,
would you stoke the fire.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.477
It's getting
a little chilly.

08:40.853 --> 08:41.520
Sure.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.540
-Jesus, man, be careful.
-Oh, fuck off, Todd.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.920
Caitlin,
open your present.

09:10.299 --> 09:12.718
She remembered what I wanted.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.361
It's the wrong one.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.614
Well, she, she has lots
of presents to buy, so...

09:35.449 --> 09:36.617
Had...

09:36.701 --> 09:39.495
Mom just made a mistake.

09:39.578 --> 09:42.331
People keep saying that
she just... made a mistake.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.710
Like it's her fault
that she died.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.879
Look, it could happen
to anyone.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.882
Alright? She just had
too much to drink and--

09:51.966 --> 09:54.343
Stop saying
that she was drunk.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.221
No one said Mom
did anything wrong.

09:58.597 --> 10:00.474
-It just happened.
-She had some wine.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.019
She was stressed out because
she had to make money and work

10:03.102 --> 10:04.562
-and take care of everybody!
-Caitlin, Caitlin--

10:04.645 --> 10:06.772
No, she wasn't drunk,
Todd, okay,

10:06.856 --> 10:08.524
you fucking asshole!

10:08.607 --> 10:11.360
Why, why are you suddenly
calling her Mom?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.321
It's not like you
ever called her that.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.327
I mean, if she just
fell down the stairs...

10:22.747 --> 10:25.541
You know, this--
this seems so fucking pointless.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.045
Did you get those waiters?

11:12.463 --> 11:14.006
For Saturday?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.966
The ones with the bow ties.

11:16.050 --> 11:16.717
Yeah. For Sunday.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.512
Saturday.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.056
The fundraiser's on Sunday.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.811
-Who told you that?
-You did, Michael.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.730
I'll be in New York on Saturday
for Caitlin's parents' weekend.

11:31.857 --> 11:32.983
Shit.

11:36.195 --> 11:36.695
You think anyone's
going to show?

11:40.074 --> 11:41.826
You always worry
about these things,
and they always work out.

11:45.287 --> 11:47.039
They work because of you.

11:54.672 --> 11:55.881
I'll be there.

11:56.757 --> 11:57.842
Don't you worry.

12:07.435 --> 12:10.146
Remember we promised you'd
give Clay a lift to school.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.939
I remember!

12:55.774 --> 12:56.901
Thanks for the ride.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.152
Dad said
it wasn't a big deal

12:58.235 --> 12:59.445
since it's on
your way to work.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.697
It gives us
a chance to catch up.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.199
It's hard when
everyone's so busy.

13:03.282 --> 13:03.866
Yeah.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.076
So what have you
been up to?

13:07.369 --> 13:08.871
Uh, you know,
just trying to figure out

13:08.954 --> 13:10.206
my money situation.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.875
It's, uh...
it's, it's tight.

13:12.958 --> 13:16.003
Yeah. There never seems
to be enough, right?

13:16.795 --> 13:19.381
And Becky?
Work's good for her?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.050
You guys are good?

13:21.133 --> 13:21.926
Yeah, we're, it's fine.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.774
Woman
Was the attack on
the World Trade Center...

13:37.608 --> 13:39.944
In your professional opinion,

13:40.027 --> 13:41.779
do you think we're
going to experience

13:41.862 --> 13:42.530
a massive outbreak...

13:45.491 --> 13:47.409
-It's not your fault.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.999
Ma'am, it's a mercy.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.000
That's what we do.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.003
Thank you, Officer.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.604
You reach a clearing
in the middle of a forest.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.773
Your footsteps are light.

14:19.858 --> 14:22.611
Count each step
in your mind.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.989
One...

14:26.865 --> 14:28.158
...two...

14:29.368 --> 14:31.120
...three...

14:31.203 --> 14:33.414
-...four...
-Four.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.498
-...five...

14:34.582 --> 14:36.625
-Hi. Oh.
-...six...

14:36.709 --> 14:39.295
-Am I interrupting?
-...seven...

14:39.378 --> 14:41.630
-...eight...
-I had a weird morning.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.300
-...nine...
-Well, John and Frank Dunn

14:44.383 --> 14:44.883
want a meeting.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.221
-And again...
-When?

14:49.305 --> 14:50.931
Later this afternoon.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.891
One, two...

14:52.975 --> 14:54.435
Well, about what?

14:54.518 --> 14:56.812
...three, four...

14:56.895 --> 14:57.521
Okay. Thanks.

14:57.605 --> 15:01.066
-...five...
-Sure.

16:11.762 --> 16:12.971
You served?

16:15.474 --> 16:17.184
-Marines. You?
-Same.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.104
-Semper Fi till I die.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.526
You from around here?

16:25.609 --> 16:27.528
Nah. Just visiting.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.322
Thought I'd
check out the scene,

16:31.281 --> 16:32.408
see what Durham's about.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.329
Yeah...

16:42.584 --> 16:44.795
You want to, uh...

16:46.171 --> 16:47.840
want to tell me
what it's about?

16:50.676 --> 16:52.010
Oh, you know...

16:55.180 --> 16:56.223
it's about...

16:57.349 --> 16:58.600
this and that.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.321
-ManMortgages, man.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.823
I'm telling ya.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.033
That's where
the money's going.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.161
Ya know?

17:22.207 --> 17:24.626
Is it just me,
or is it like a sauna in here?

17:36.513 --> 17:37.848
Man
Mr. Peterson.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.975
Jim!

17:40.893 --> 17:43.020
Read your column
this week.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.773
The target on my back
is getting pretty heavy.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.275
You keep going after
the little guys.

17:48.358 --> 17:49.860
You know, you rack up wins.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.363
If you tackled a real issue,
I'd let up.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.076
Mm. Well...

17:57.159 --> 18:00.496
I'm sorry.
Sometimes the truth hurts.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.997
You keep on lookin'
for the truth.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.294
One day, you might
trip right over it.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.301
So Nortel is going
to write you a check

18:14.384 --> 18:15.469
for Kathleen's backpay.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.805
That'll cover bail,

18:18.597 --> 18:20.599
Rudolf's retainer, initial fees.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.227
I, um...

18:24.436 --> 18:26.313
I don't know how we're
going to swing the rest.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.107
We got bigger things
to worry about.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.446
Candace and Lori,

18:34.530 --> 18:36.532
they're not
answering my calls.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.077
Do you think
the DA got to 'em?

18:43.997 --> 18:46.542
It's horseshit.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.710
I mean, they never,
never liked me.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.174
I'm going
to need a favor.

18:57.135 --> 18:58.929
I need you to tell
the kids about...

19:02.266 --> 19:05.269
-You want me
to tell them about--
-The photos.

19:05.352 --> 19:09.857
You know, and, uh,
you know, my interest in, um...

19:13.735 --> 19:16.280
They're going to ask,
is it just the photos...

19:18.490 --> 19:20.742
...or were you,
you having an affair.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.327
Oh, Bill,
for Christ's sake.

19:23.161 --> 19:24.288
An affair?

19:24.371 --> 19:26.748
Kathleen was the only one.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.294
She really knew me.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.461
Kathleen knew everything?

19:31.545 --> 19:33.547
Of course.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.967
Uh, the police

19:37.050 --> 19:42.431
found some photos
on your dad's computer.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.934
Um,

19:46.018 --> 19:50.105
well, the photos were
of an intimate nature.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.360
And, and that nature
was homosexual.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.947
They were, uh,
homosexual... photos.

19:59.031 --> 20:04.536
Just a bunch
of stupid, stupid photos.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.793
Okay?

20:15.881 --> 20:17.883
-Kids, you, you have any--
-So Dad's gay?

20:17.966 --> 20:19.551
-What?
-No.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.302
No, no, no, no.
He likes women.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.846
He loved Kathleen.
Uh, just...

20:22.930 --> 20:27.351
Uh, he likes
the idea of men.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.648
Right now, I know
this is a lot to process,

20:32.731 --> 20:35.067
but it, it gets easier.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.693
Wait, when did you
find out?

20:36.777 --> 20:39.196
Uh, I guess I've...

20:40.697 --> 20:41.823
always known

20:42.908 --> 20:44.493
since we were little.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.537
You know, life wasn't
always easy for your dad.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.121
So Dad's bisexual?

20:48.205 --> 20:50.374
Bingo.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.459
Did you guys know?

20:53.877 --> 20:57.005
Remember those jean shorts?

20:57.089 --> 20:59.675
-The really short ones.
-Did Mom know?

20:59.758 --> 21:02.094
-Those fucking shorts.
-I tried to throw 'em away.

21:02.177 --> 21:02.844
No, wait, did Mom know?

21:02.928 --> 21:05.639
Yes, uh, Kathleen knew.

21:09.267 --> 21:11.019
Alright.
Well, this doesn't matter.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.565
-I mean, Dad's Dad.
-Right. Dad's Dad.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.072
Is that it?

21:22.614 --> 21:24.574
Yeah.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.116
David
You've been locked up
too long.

22:06.199 --> 22:08.910
Let's get you
the fuck out of here.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.746
Make a path.
Make a path. Make a path.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.710
Take your time.
We have nothing to hide.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.086
Michael, excuse me...

22:26.386 --> 22:28.930
We'll be making
a statement at a later date.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.766
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.059
Excuse me.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.978
So, we're going
to need access

22:35.062 --> 22:36.980
to your accounts,

22:37.064 --> 22:38.440
all your financials.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.484
Bill, didn't you give
this man his money?

22:40.567 --> 22:42.402
-- Yeah. Of course.
-- No, no, no, no.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.696
We need to do
forensic accounting.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.616
The DA's going to say you killed
Kathleen because of your debt.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.702
I killed her for the money?
I just optioned my book.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.455
Oh? Well, how, how much
you get for that?

22:53.538 --> 22:56.291
He got ten.
Ten, ten thousand.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.919
-Oh.
-The backend's ridiculous.

22:59.002 --> 23:02.130
Well, uh, Tom Maher's going
to take care of financials.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.799
-You met Tom yet?
-No.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.008
Bill, you just got to go.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.259
They'll, they'll
get out of the way.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.011
What are we going
to do about the DA?

23:08.095 --> 23:09.304
-That's it.

23:09.387 --> 23:09.971
There you go.
That's it.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.099
Have you read the papers?

23:12.182 --> 23:13.475
Hardin's trying
to make me look like,

23:13.558 --> 23:14.601
like Satan incarnate.

23:14.684 --> 23:15.560
Don't sweat Hardin.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.144
We got Judge Orlando Hudson.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.229
Who's he?

23:17.312 --> 23:20.190
He and I go way back.
He's a good one.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.691
Uh, is that it, Ron?

23:21.775 --> 23:23.777
Uh, what about
those French guys?

23:23.860 --> 23:25.153
Ah, right.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.530
This is a first for me.

23:26.613 --> 23:30.283
Uh, I got a call from
a couple documentarians.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.536
I looked into them myself.
They're legit.

23:32.619 --> 23:33.703
They even got a flick out now
with some Oscar buzz.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.957
They want to make a movie
about the US justice system.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.834
Our case would be
some sort of example.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.918
Really?

23:40.502 --> 23:42.170
What do you think?

23:42.254 --> 23:44.548
We could get a call lined up,
but let's sit on it.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.800
Not a priority.

23:46.883 --> 23:49.427
Well, the French
do have good taste.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.140
He's here!

23:57.686 --> 24:01.189
-I love you!
-Margaret; Oh, we missed you.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.567
It's so good to see you.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.527
Mm.
Hey, kid, get over here.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.113
-Come on.
-It's good
to have you home.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.281
That's better. That's better.
-- Are you okay?

24:09.364 --> 24:11.366
Alright, hold on, hold on.

24:11.449 --> 24:14.578
-Let me go take a shower.
-We missed you!

24:14.661 --> 24:16.121
And get some of
the stink off me.

24:16.204 --> 24:18.582
I'm making you lasagna.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.458
Got a nice bottle
of red for you.

24:20.542 --> 24:23.211
Uh, you guys talked
to Uncle Bill, right?

24:23.295 --> 24:24.045
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
-It went well?

24:24.129 --> 24:26.381
-It went well.
-Good.

24:27.257 --> 24:27.424
Good!

24:46.443 --> 24:47.986
I got it!

24:51.239 --> 24:53.742
Fred.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.327
My dad's here.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.079
Hi, girls.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.247
Hi.

25:00.040 --> 25:03.043
I am, um, so sorry.

25:04.836 --> 25:05.837
Thank you, Fred.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.132
Let's just go outside.

25:13.637 --> 25:17.015
I don't want
to be indelicate here,

25:17.098 --> 25:19.476
but your mom's backpay
from Nortel,

25:20.393 --> 25:22.103
they paid it out.

25:22.187 --> 25:25.523
Plus the life
insurance money, I mean.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.109
It's, it's a lot.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.402
I mean, enough
to rent something

25:29.486 --> 25:31.154
while all of this
is happening.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.490
Everyone can move together.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.955
Mike... didn't
mention anything?

25:40.705 --> 25:41.498
No.

25:41.581 --> 25:44.793
They don't really have time
to talk to me

25:44.876 --> 25:46.419
unless it's about,

25:46.503 --> 25:48.546
like, scheduling
an interview or something.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.471
Candace keeps leaving
these crazy messages

25:56.554 --> 25:59.557
about Mike and, like,
things in the house

25:59.641 --> 26:01.685
he could have used to...

26:03.728 --> 26:05.522
She wants me to go
and check and see

26:05.605 --> 26:07.190
if anything's missing.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.984
I am so sorry, Cay.

26:10.568 --> 26:12.404
She keeps trying
to tell me

26:12.487 --> 26:15.073
what I already know,
that...

26:18.076 --> 26:19.703
You already know what?

26:21.830 --> 26:23.373
Mike is bisexual.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.005
Okay.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.717
Did Mom ever say
anything to you?

26:33.800 --> 26:34.634
About Mike and that stuff?

26:37.429 --> 26:39.222
Uh, no. No.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.183
Your mother and I,
basically, um,

26:42.267 --> 26:44.102
just talked about you.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.397
I, uh...

26:47.480 --> 26:49.733
Cay, I don't know
how to say this, but, uh...

26:52.319 --> 26:53.778
the DA called.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.238
Yeah, they're calling
everyone.

26:55.322 --> 26:59.200
Yes. But there's photos
of Kathleen.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.454
They were taken
after she fell.

27:02.537 --> 27:05.248
And they're going
to be released.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.417
And it sounds like
these photos are,

27:08.084 --> 27:10.128
are pretty bad, Caitlin.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.922
And I do not want you
to see them, you know,

27:13.006 --> 27:17.844
just accidentally on the cover
of a newspaper or on TV

27:17.927 --> 27:19.637
or, or God knows where.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.016
-Oh, sweetheart.

27:26.853 --> 27:27.979
It's okay.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.399
It's okay.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.193
Why don't you,

27:33.276 --> 27:34.569
why don't you come stay
with me tonight.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.156
At the hotel?

27:43.078 --> 27:45.080
Okay?

27:50.668 --> 27:52.545
So catering's
all set for Saturday.

27:52.629 --> 27:56.549
And I thought
you might want these.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.760
Oh, thanks.
Hey, did you hear anything?

27:58.843 --> 28:02.055
Now management's saying
that they got it figured out,

28:02.138 --> 28:03.556
so they don't need
the meeting.

28:03.640 --> 28:03.681
Figured what out?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.601
I don't know.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.812
And Caitlin's on line three.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.398
Oh.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.692
Okay.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.489
Wait. What?
What do you mean
you're not coming?

28:19.572 --> 28:22.117
Kathleen
Well, I, I have to help
Mike with his fundraiser.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.493
I'm really sorry.

28:23.576 --> 28:26.454
Why can't you make it up
to Mike, Mom?

28:26.538 --> 28:29.374
Honey, the fundraiser
is very important.

28:29.457 --> 28:32.877
And it's happening this weekend,
whether I want it to or not.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.300
How about I come see you
in two weeks?

28:39.384 --> 28:41.803
No. It's not the same.
I'll...

28:41.886 --> 28:43.513
I'll just, I'll see you
at Thanksgiving then.

28:43.596 --> 28:44.931
No, don't be like that.

28:45.014 --> 28:45.932
No, I got to go.

28:47.892 --> 28:48.685
No...

28:52.021 --> 28:54.232
It's going to be
a feature-length documentary

28:54.315 --> 28:57.485
focusing on the prosecution,
defense, and the judge.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.612
I got to say,
I'm, I'm real concerned

28:59.696 --> 29:01.322
with confidentiality.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.117
The tapes are being sent
to Paris as we film.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.910
It'll get
a lot more complicated

29:05.994 --> 29:07.495
than just, um,
shipping some tapes.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.790
Absolutely.
But we've been there

29:10.874 --> 29:12.500
with our last movie.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.420
Well, we haven't and
that's what's important.

29:15.503 --> 29:18.590
That's irrelevant...

29:18.673 --> 29:21.176
So what you're saying is
you, you want to leave Paris

29:21.259 --> 29:23.720
and come to Durham?

29:23.803 --> 29:24.721
Yes, we'd relocate.

29:24.804 --> 29:27.932
Well,
that's absolute insanity.

29:28.016 --> 29:28.683
I mean, Paris is beautiful.

29:28.766 --> 29:33.313
And Durham is, um...
Durham.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.193
Uh, Michael, Jean here.

29:38.276 --> 29:41.070
Um, do you know
Paris well?

29:41.154 --> 29:43.656
Intimately. Kathleen
and I wanted to retire there.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.700
And we wanted to get
a little place in the Marais.

29:47.827 --> 29:50.538
Whichever case
we focus on,

29:50.622 --> 29:52.707
we'll be making something
for the ages.

29:55.668 --> 29:57.295
You're talking
to other people?

29:57.378 --> 30:00.298
Yes. A few.
It's, it's standard.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.225
I-I'm worried
about some things

30:10.308 --> 30:12.810
that will come to light,
so to speak.

30:12.894 --> 30:17.774
Well, I'm, I'm happy to,
to address these concerns.

30:18.816 --> 30:24.322
Kathleen and I were
very much in love.

30:24.405 --> 30:27.575
She was my soulmate.
Of that, I'm, I'm sure.

30:27.659 --> 30:31.204
But I'm,
I'm also bisexual,

30:32.539 --> 30:34.582
which happens to be a problem

30:34.666 --> 30:37.168
for some people, you know,
especially in Durham.

30:38.836 --> 30:41.256
Uh, Michael, for, for us,

30:41.339 --> 30:43.007
your sexuality
is not a problem.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.804
Listen, um...

30:49.764 --> 30:51.558
we'll give it some thought.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.393
Great.
Let's stay in touch.

30:53.476 --> 30:54.686
Thank you.

30:59.232 --> 31:01.693
-Hey.
-Hi.

31:04.153 --> 31:06.447
-How's the hotel?
-It's fine.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.032
Thanks for meeting me here.

31:09.951 --> 31:13.580
The house is so...
stressful.

31:13.663 --> 31:15.707
Can't wait
until they clean...

31:17.750 --> 31:19.210
everything up.

31:27.051 --> 31:27.844
Um...

31:30.597 --> 31:34.392
So I-I've been thinking...

31:37.812 --> 31:39.897
Mike... lied to us.

31:43.860 --> 31:44.569
What do you mean?

31:44.652 --> 31:49.490
About... like, small things.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.492
I mean, Dad tells stories.

31:51.576 --> 31:55.121
Yeah. But like,
the Purple Heart thing. And...

31:55.204 --> 31:58.249
Like, we didn't know
that he was gay.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.336
-Bisexual
-Okay, bisexual. Whatever.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.337
That's like
an important part.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.756
It's a very important part
of who somebody is.

32:04.839 --> 32:08.760
And he...
he kept that from us.

32:08.843 --> 32:11.054
From... from all of us.

32:11.137 --> 32:14.515
-I mean, not from Mom.
-No, she would have told me.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.517
What, she would have told you
about her sex life?

32:16.601 --> 32:17.644
No, not the details,

32:17.727 --> 32:19.270
but she would have
found a way

32:19.354 --> 32:19.854
to let me know.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.150
Like, she told me.
She told me what happened

32:24.233 --> 32:25.902
with my Dad, Fred,
what he did,

32:25.985 --> 32:27.528
and how he cheated on her.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.364
Yeah, but Dad
didn't cheat on Mom.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.365
-You think it's gross?
-No, I don't think it's gross.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.700
I think it's...

32:32.784 --> 32:34.327
wrong, okay.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.788
They were married,
and she loved him.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.713
How did a woman

32:46.839 --> 32:51.386
end up at the bottom
of the stairs dead

32:55.556 --> 32:57.892
from blunt force trauma?

33:00.645 --> 33:02.397
With an object

33:03.314 --> 33:04.816
heavy enough to kill

33:06.150 --> 33:10.905
but light enough
not to fracture a skull.

33:10.988 --> 33:13.408
Now that's a difficult
combination to replicate...

33:13.491 --> 33:14.826
for most.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.578
But not for us.

33:18.204 --> 33:21.332
At SBI, we get it done.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.762
You want me to run inside

33:34.846 --> 33:37.181
so you can
continue ruminating?

33:38.015 --> 33:38.141
Hmm?

33:40.560 --> 33:42.562
Need anything?

33:42.645 --> 33:44.439
Only that you'll
hurry back, right?

34:18.598 --> 34:20.016
That be it for you?

34:24.771 --> 34:28.149
I, uh, I gotta get going.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.000
-What happened?
-Nothing.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.502
It's nothing, I think.

34:54.801 --> 34:58.846
It's a big day for us.
Hmm?

35:08.940 --> 35:10.066
We've got
two stories to tell.

35:12.276 --> 35:15.363
The story of what
happened that night

35:15.446 --> 35:18.533
and the story
of the great love

35:18.616 --> 35:20.701
between you and Kathleen.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.329
I haven't been able
to find anyone

35:23.412 --> 35:26.541
that's willing to say
one bad thing about you two.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.876
Most folks were jealous.

35:28.960 --> 35:29.710
I hate to think
what my neighbors would say

35:29.794 --> 35:30.878
about me and the wife.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.130
Right.
But we can't find anyone

35:33.214 --> 35:35.049
willing to testify
that Kathleen knew

35:35.132 --> 35:39.428
about... your...
diverse interests.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.267
You talked to my friends
about that?

35:46.769 --> 35:47.103
That's what we do.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.899
Got to know what the DA
is going to dig up on you.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.442
As long as you're
honest with us,

35:53.526 --> 35:56.529
we don't expect
any surprises from the DA.

35:56.612 --> 35:59.240
-Right, Ron?
-I got eyes
in the courthouse.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.454
Which is how I came
about these.

36:07.164 --> 36:09.959
Uh, hold up.
So these are,

36:10.042 --> 36:13.170
uh, Kathleen's
autopsy photos.

36:19.343 --> 36:20.303
You need to look at them.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.267
Why?

36:26.350 --> 36:30.813
All autopsy photos
are bad... Mike.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.106
These are worse.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.735
I don't want you to be
surprised in the courtroom.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.529
I'm a veteran, David.

36:39.655 --> 36:40.907
I've seen death.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.619
Doesn't mean I need
to see more of it.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.204
I wouldn't ask you
if I didn't think
it was important.

36:47.288 --> 36:49.790
Well, I, uh,
I'm not looking at them.

36:49.874 --> 36:53.294
Not tonight.
Not ever.

36:53.377 --> 36:56.297
You see that?
That's how my wife
deserves to be remembered.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.298
Hmm?

36:57.381 --> 36:59.717
Photos of her lying
in some morgue,

36:59.800 --> 37:02.011
that's not Kathleen.

37:02.845 --> 37:04.472
Look, we hear you, Mike,

37:04.555 --> 37:06.098
but we need you to take
a look at these photos.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.100
I, I don't even know
why I'm listening to this.

37:08.184 --> 37:10.269
Fuck. I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.945
Hey, you want to see what
your mom looked like, huh?

37:19.028 --> 37:20.655
Of course not, Dad.
Never.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.156
Oh, good. That's good.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.892
You're a beautiful
young woman.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.562
Your mother
was beautiful as well.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.189
Inside and out.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.277
Can you tell me about her?

38:03.489 --> 38:05.116
I'm sorry, do you mind
if we don't talk

38:05.199 --> 38:06.367
about my mom right now?

38:07.743 --> 38:09.286
Of course. Of course.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.290
You have two stepsisters,

38:14.208 --> 38:15.835
Margaret
and Martha Ratliff.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.963
How are you all
holding up?

38:19.046 --> 38:19.297
We're okay.

38:21.590 --> 38:24.844
At least we're,
we're trying to be okay.

38:26.762 --> 38:28.139
This is a tough time.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.435
Yeah, it is.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.855
It's made even more difficult

38:35.938 --> 38:38.607
by seeing your stepfather,
Michael Peterson,

38:38.691 --> 38:42.403
being accused of hurting,
of killing your mother.

38:44.488 --> 38:45.448
You clearly think
so highly of him.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.663
"Michael Peterson stopped
my mother's tears.

38:52.747 --> 38:56.083
"He restored her strength
and her confidence

38:56.167 --> 38:57.918
"and showed her that
she could find true love

38:58.002 --> 38:59.587
after my father's deceit--"

38:59.670 --> 39:00.546
Wait, where did you get that?

39:01.839 --> 39:03.132
It's a school paper
you wrote.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.426
Yes, but how did you get it?

39:05.509 --> 39:08.596
David, Mr. Rudolf,
gave it to me.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.347
Yeah. Uh, Mike saved it

39:10.431 --> 39:12.266
uh, and thought
you'd like to share it

39:12.349 --> 39:13.768
considering
the circumstances.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.234
I, I think actually
I need a minute.

39:22.318 --> 39:25.071
I-I'm sorry, can I use,
can I use your bathroom?

39:56.811 --> 39:58.771
Mike, you upstairs?

39:58.854 --> 40:00.272
That looks great,
you guys.

40:00.356 --> 40:01.941
So just through
to the dining room.

40:04.860 --> 40:07.404
Michael, will you
please grab my shoes?

40:07.488 --> 40:10.449
Just straight through there.
Thank you so much.

40:10.533 --> 40:11.534
Hi!

40:11.617 --> 40:12.493
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.995
-Thank you.
-The place looks great.

40:15.079 --> 40:16.872
You're going to make Mike
a million bucks.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.290
I'd settle for ten grand.

40:18.374 --> 40:20.126
And look who I ran into
at the florist?

40:20.209 --> 40:21.752
-Dennis the Menace.
-Hey.

40:21.836 --> 40:24.338
Oh my gosh. Dennis Rowe.
Here, thank you.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.508
I hope you don't mind
an underdressed guest.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.635
Oh, come as you are,
as long as you got a checkbook.

40:29.718 --> 40:30.302
Let's go get
the rest of the flowers.

40:30.386 --> 40:31.137
-Yeah.
-Thanks, you guys.

40:31.220 --> 40:32.471
-See you in a minute
-Yeah. See ya.

40:35.599 --> 40:38.102
Mike, uh, let me
introduce you to the team.

40:38.185 --> 40:41.105
Henry Lee, our blood guy.

40:41.188 --> 40:41.856
Werner Spitz,
who wrote the book

40:41.939 --> 40:44.692
on forensic pathology.

40:44.775 --> 40:46.402
Faris Bandak,
injury biomechanics.

40:46.485 --> 40:50.447
And, uh, Tim Palmbach,
our crime scene analyst.

40:51.490 --> 40:54.243
Why don't we, uh,
take a look up close?

40:57.371 --> 40:59.206
Faris, why don't you,
uh, get in there

40:59.290 --> 41:03.627
and see if, uh,
you need to be close up.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.546
-Werner.
-Nah, this is too tight.

41:10.801 --> 41:13.095
-Hey.
-Brent
It's Brent. how's it going?

41:13.179 --> 41:14.388
I only got a minute.

41:14.471 --> 41:16.682
-I got a big event tonight.
-Oh, yeah?

41:16.765 --> 41:17.558
I'm kind of a,
kind of a powerful guy.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.602
You could show me next week.

41:19.685 --> 41:22.188
Let's make sure our dates
don't change again.

41:22.271 --> 41:23.731
-I really want to meet you.
-I promise.

41:23.814 --> 41:26.150
-- Mike!
Guests are arriving!
-- Next week.

41:26.233 --> 41:27.651
See you then.

41:30.696 --> 41:32.948
Come on. What are you doing?
People are here.

41:33.032 --> 41:35.075
-Jesus, look at you.
-What?

41:35.159 --> 41:36.118
Aah!

41:43.209 --> 41:46.086
Bam,
the head only hits once,

41:46.170 --> 41:47.630
but the impact causes
multiple wounds.

41:50.633 --> 41:51.550
The flesh splinters.

41:54.094 --> 41:56.263
Even so...

41:56.347 --> 42:00.601
one fall can't explain
seven lacerations.

42:00.684 --> 42:01.685
Two falls then?

42:03.938 --> 42:06.440
It helps to explain the blood
on the soles of her feet.

42:15.866 --> 42:16.575
-Hey, come--

42:18.535 --> 42:19.954
So we're in the locker room,

42:20.037 --> 42:23.040
and Hardin's whining
about my articles.

42:23.123 --> 42:25.668
That bingo hall expose
was incendiary stuff.

42:25.751 --> 42:29.421
Honestly, we, we got rapists
running around Durham,

42:29.505 --> 42:31.799
and Hardin's wasting
finite resources

42:31.882 --> 42:33.259
going after bingo halls.

42:33.342 --> 42:34.301
Hope none of your
grandmothers got busted.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.804
Oh, unless
they're also rapists.

42:39.223 --> 42:42.518
Dennis, meet Michael,
Kathleen's husband.

42:42.601 --> 42:45.437
Oh, uh, Dennis Rowe.
Nice to meet you.

42:45.521 --> 42:48.023
You're the one
running for office?

42:48.107 --> 42:51.110
Uh, yes, yes.
A pleasure.

42:51.193 --> 42:52.987
Now, where is that,
that wife of mine?

42:56.240 --> 42:57.866
Now's just,
it's really not a good time.

42:57.950 --> 43:00.703
Um... can you just send

43:00.786 --> 43:02.788
the, the documents
to my email?

43:02.871 --> 43:04.456
Devon
I'll get that right over.
Did you bring

43:04.540 --> 43:05.332
-your laptop home?
-Yeah, of course.
I brought my laptop home.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.501
It's, you know,
it's my third leg.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.169
Kathleen,
where are you hiding?

43:09.253 --> 43:10.838
I've got more to go over
with you, like the--

43:10.921 --> 43:13.215
Let me call you back.
Yes, I'll call you back.

43:20.139 --> 43:22.599
Uh, you can put the checks
in the basket there.

43:22.683 --> 43:23.892
Thank you!

43:28.230 --> 43:32.401
So this is where
she's falling back

43:32.484 --> 43:33.902
down the stairs,

43:34.945 --> 43:36.947
and then she hits
her head...

43:38.741 --> 43:39.783
right here.

43:40.409 --> 43:41.827
The back.

43:41.910 --> 43:43.412
Then she goes down,

43:43.495 --> 43:46.123
hitting her head
a second time here

43:46.707 --> 43:48.917
and ended up here,

43:49.001 --> 43:51.086
then the cough.

43:53.005 --> 43:56.842
And on this side and she turns
over her head and then...

43:59.553 --> 44:01.221
See, that's both sides.

44:01.305 --> 44:05.768
And then she will try
to pull herself up.

44:05.851 --> 44:08.604
That's why the blood marks
on the, on the wall,

44:08.687 --> 44:10.064
and then loses her balance,

44:10.147 --> 44:12.232
goes back...

44:14.026 --> 44:15.569
all the way here.

44:15.652 --> 44:18.072
And then that is
her last position.

44:22.785 --> 44:24.370
Speech.
Speech, Michael.

44:24.453 --> 44:25.871
Let's hear
from the candidate.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.832
Uh, that would be me.

44:28.916 --> 44:30.084
-Okay.

44:30.167 --> 44:31.043
Um...

44:32.711 --> 44:34.588
Oh. Uh, alright.
Thank you.

44:37.383 --> 44:41.595
Every man deserves
a second chance.

44:41.678 --> 44:43.764
But not every man gets one.

44:43.847 --> 44:48.602
So I'm honored to receive
so much support for mine.

44:48.685 --> 44:52.106
I couldn't be happier
to be running
for city council.

44:52.189 --> 44:54.942
Durham means
the world to me.

44:55.025 --> 44:55.651
And so do all of you.

44:58.195 --> 45:00.239
But before it gets
too late,

45:01.407 --> 45:03.033
let me introduce

45:03.117 --> 45:05.077
the evening's entertainment.

45:07.746 --> 45:09.456
The Durham Dance Company.

46:03.677 --> 46:06.180
Look at what you've done.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.515
Look at this.

46:09.099 --> 46:10.267
You're incredible.

46:40.839 --> 46:42.216
I'm tired, Michael.

46:43.091 --> 46:47.095
Like, all the time.
To my bones.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.181
I need help.

46:50.140 --> 46:51.433
I know, baby.

46:51.517 --> 46:52.518
I know.

46:53.852 --> 46:55.437
I'll make it easier,
I promise.

46:55.896 --> 46:57.022
I promise.

47:00.192 --> 47:00.734
Woman
Help!

47:03.362 --> 47:05.739
Help! Anybody!

47:07.157 --> 47:08.575
Help me!

47:09.076 --> 47:10.327
Somebody!

47:11.119 --> 47:13.080
Help!

47:13.163 --> 47:14.665
I need help!

47:15.082 --> 47:16.333
Anybody!

47:17.376 --> 47:19.586
Help me!

47:19.670 --> 47:21.547
-- Mike.
-- Help!

47:23.173 --> 47:24.258
-- Mike... help me.
-- Please!

47:24.341 --> 47:26.426
Hey, buddy.

47:27.344 --> 47:28.345
Help!

47:28.428 --> 47:31.056
Let's take a walk.

47:31.139 --> 47:33.100
I need help! Anybody!

47:33.183 --> 47:35.435
Help me!

47:36.019 --> 47:37.229
Help!

47:38.772 --> 47:40.482
Anybody. Hel--

47:56.707 --> 48:00.961
She's on the stairs.
You're by the pool.

48:01.044 --> 48:03.297
You couldn't hear
a goddamn thing out here.

48:04.214 --> 48:06.300
Nothing.

48:29.156 --> 48:30.991
Hey, you've
reached Caitlin Atwater.

48:31.074 --> 48:31.825
Please leave
your name and number,

48:31.908 --> 48:34.244
and maybe
I'll get back to you.

48:34.328 --> 48:35.537
-Honey, it's me.

48:35.621 --> 48:37.873
Uh, I wanted to say sorry

48:37.956 --> 48:39.625
for missing
parents' weekend.

48:40.626 --> 48:43.920
Um, Mike's night was a, a hit.

48:44.963 --> 48:46.882
He may even win this thing.

48:46.965 --> 48:48.717
Uh... listen.

48:48.800 --> 48:52.012
Sometimes things
happen in life,

48:52.095 --> 48:56.516
and, uh, you got to make
a choice about what to do.

48:57.434 --> 48:59.978
And there's
no clear right way,

49:00.062 --> 49:02.898
and there's
no clear wrong way.

49:02.981 --> 49:04.942
What I'm trying
to say is, uh, sometimes

49:05.025 --> 49:08.695
there's no option that's
going to make you feel

49:09.196 --> 49:10.113
completely good.

49:10.197 --> 49:14.910
So, uh, you gotta look
at your choices and...

49:17.621 --> 49:18.955
make a tough decision.

49:22.709 --> 49:24.336
I know you're upset,

49:25.504 --> 49:25.921
but I'll make it up to you.

49:28.340 --> 49:29.508
'Cause I'm your mom.

49:31.134 --> 49:32.344
I love you.

49:35.889 --> 49:37.724
You're stuck with me, kid.

49:55.534 --> 49:56.702
Shit.

50:04.292 --> 50:06.002
-Oh my god!

50:37.159 --> 50:41.288
Kathleen suffered
numerous injuries.

50:41.371 --> 50:42.330
For fuck's sake.

50:42.414 --> 50:44.750
After tonight,

50:44.833 --> 50:47.461
we can account
for nearly all of them.

50:49.045 --> 50:49.129
Alright?

50:51.506 --> 50:53.300
She wasn't beaten
to death by her husband

50:53.383 --> 50:54.593
with some sort of a weapon.

50:54.676 --> 50:57.804
She wasn't, uh,
attacked by an intruder.

50:57.888 --> 50:59.055
Kathleen fell.

51:00.307 --> 51:01.266
Twice.

51:03.268 --> 51:04.895
Mike and Kathleen
eat dinner.

51:05.812 --> 51:08.482
They watch a movie,

51:08.565 --> 51:11.026
uh, "America's Sweethearts."

51:11.109 --> 51:13.987
She speaks briefly
to a coworker

51:14.070 --> 51:16.823
before they decide to end
an already lovely evening

51:16.907 --> 51:19.242
by taking in the stars.

51:30.545 --> 51:31.797
Stay for one more.

51:33.882 --> 51:37.511
Why shut out the day
before it is done?

51:37.594 --> 51:39.554
Because
some of us have jobs.

51:41.765 --> 51:43.517
I got to get some
stuff done before bed.

51:43.600 --> 51:44.351
Hmm.

51:44.434 --> 51:46.686
You take a pill
to help you sleep?

51:46.770 --> 51:47.813
Yeah.

51:48.855 --> 51:49.064
Come to bed soon, okay.

52:31.940 --> 52:33.483
Oh.

52:36.486 --> 52:37.779
Let's do it tomorrow.

52:43.493 --> 52:45.161
-Oh.

53:26.536 --> 53:27.579
Oh!

53:52.103 --> 53:54.314
Oh god, Michael,
help me!

54:35.939 --> 54:37.941
And when Mike finds her,

54:38.024 --> 54:39.859
she's still breathing.

54:39.943 --> 54:43.405
So... he holds her,

54:44.447 --> 54:46.908
he grabs towels,

54:46.992 --> 54:48.868
wipes her face clean.

54:48.952 --> 54:50.578
He calls 911.

54:52.038 --> 54:53.248
Begs for help.

54:54.791 --> 54:56.042
But...

54:57.460 --> 54:58.461
it's too late.

55:02.465 --> 55:05.552
You know, sometimes,
when we do everything we can,

55:05.635 --> 55:07.721
it's...

55:09.556 --> 55:11.224
it's still not enough.

55:14.019 --> 55:15.520
It's never enough.

55:25.947 --> 55:28.283
Alright, so she falls twice.

55:29.826 --> 55:31.286
Um, blood's everywhere.

55:31.369 --> 55:32.328
What about the scratches
on her face?

55:34.372 --> 55:37.083
What, what about the,
you know, broken,

55:37.167 --> 55:38.460
you know, neck bone?

55:38.543 --> 55:39.252
-Thyroid--
-I'm sorry.

55:39.335 --> 55:41.755
-Thyroid cartilage.
-Thank you.

55:41.838 --> 55:43.798
I mean, do we say
how she got those?

55:43.882 --> 55:45.592
-No.
-Why not?

55:45.675 --> 55:48.678
Because you don't get them
falling down the stairs.

55:55.268 --> 55:57.187
Maybe her throat hit the wood,
her face banged the wall.

55:57.270 --> 55:59.189
I don't, I just,
I'm not worried about it.

56:05.028 --> 56:06.196
Sorry I'm late.

56:06.279 --> 56:07.947
This is Miss Black.

56:08.031 --> 56:08.990
She's my assistant DA
on the case.

56:09.074 --> 56:10.700
I know,
she left messages.

56:10.784 --> 56:13.119
Caitlin.

56:13.203 --> 56:14.704
Uh, Fred Atwater.

56:14.788 --> 56:15.330
-Caitlin's father.
-Fred?

56:15.413 --> 56:17.415
Well, isn't that something?

56:17.499 --> 56:18.833
I'm Freda.

56:18.917 --> 56:21.086
Uh, my daddy wanted a boy,
but he got me instead,

56:21.169 --> 56:24.923
so he just went ahead
and added an A--

56:25.006 --> 56:26.674
Can we just get on
with it, please?

56:27.342 --> 56:28.593
Yes, ma'am.

56:29.803 --> 56:32.472
As we said,
autopsy photos fall

56:32.555 --> 56:33.681
into public domain.

56:36.851 --> 56:38.853
That means that eventually,
they'll be everywhere.

56:38.937 --> 56:41.523
For anyone to see.

57:05.046 --> 57:06.631
How bad was she hurt?

57:07.799 --> 57:09.801
There were
a variety of injuries.

57:09.884 --> 57:13.680
Uh, bruises, scratches,

57:13.763 --> 57:15.640
lacerations.

57:18.101 --> 57:20.228
Defensive wounds.

57:20.311 --> 57:22.272
Your mom lost
a lot of blood.

57:26.901 --> 57:30.530
Her blood alcohol was 0.07

57:30.613 --> 57:34.742
with a Valium level
of 0.15 milligrams per liter.

57:34.826 --> 57:37.662
To put it simply,
by legal standards,

57:37.745 --> 57:40.415
she wasn't intoxicated
when she died.

57:48.673 --> 57:50.175
Oh god.

57:51.134 --> 57:51.759
Oh god.

57:51.843 --> 57:54.262
Oh god. Oh god!

57:59.350 --> 58:03.479
Caitlin, we firmly believe
your mom didn't die

58:03.563 --> 58:05.064
from an accidental fall.

58:06.316 --> 58:09.444
We believe
Michael Peterson killed her.

58:11.946 --> 58:14.324
With what?
What does that?

58:15.241 --> 58:16.409
The weapon's yet
to be identified.

58:20.205 --> 58:21.664
Wait, what the fuck?

58:21.748 --> 58:22.540
Yeah.
What the fuck is right.

58:22.624 --> 58:24.584
I thought she was
smarter than that.

58:24.667 --> 58:25.877
But Fred's an idiot, so...

58:25.960 --> 58:27.545
What does this mean?

58:27.629 --> 58:31.007
Well, clearly, it means
we can't talk to her anymore.

58:31.090 --> 58:33.343
We, we, we can't talk
to anyone.

58:34.010 --> 58:35.678
Family is all we got.

58:38.014 --> 58:41.601
Remember, this takes time.

58:41.684 --> 58:43.394
The trial's not going
to start for months.

58:43.478 --> 58:46.105
Caitlin has one hour.

58:46.189 --> 58:49.067
She needs to stick
to her room, only her room.

58:49.150 --> 58:51.486
She would like some of
Kathleen's jewelry,
if possible.

58:51.569 --> 58:53.947
That, that will be settled
with the estate.

58:54.030 --> 58:55.990
Uh, now there's
one more thing.

58:56.074 --> 58:59.869
Some filmmakers are going
to be making a documentary
about the case.

59:02.872 --> 59:06.334
-Is this a good idea?
-It's not necessarily a bad one.

59:06.417 --> 59:10.004
It could be a good way for me
to tell my side of the story.

59:10.088 --> 59:11.506
Do we have to do anything?

59:12.257 --> 59:13.466
No.

59:13.549 --> 59:14.968
Girls, just go back
to school.

59:15.051 --> 59:16.678
Live your lives.

59:18.596 --> 59:20.682
Clay, you gotta move
to Baltimore with Becky.

59:22.850 --> 59:24.978
Hmm? Keep you out
of the spotlight.

59:26.271 --> 59:27.981
And Todd,

59:28.064 --> 59:29.899
you got to step up,
be the man of the house

59:29.983 --> 59:32.026
while I'm distracted
by all this fucking nonsense.

59:40.243 --> 59:41.995
I have to get my hair stuff.

59:42.078 --> 59:43.329
It's in the bathroom.

1:00:32.962 --> 1:00:35.798
Your home, it's lovely.

1:00:35.882 --> 1:00:36.883
We're excited
to begin the process.

1:00:36.966 --> 1:00:38.217
Oh, as am I.

1:00:38.301 --> 1:00:40.970
So where do we, uh,
start this thing?

1:00:41.054 --> 1:00:42.472
How about where
the night began?

1:00:42.555 --> 1:00:45.600
Kathleen and I
were watching a movie,

1:00:45.683 --> 1:00:47.101
uh, "America's Sweethearts."

1:00:47.185 --> 1:00:49.896
I think it was probably
around eleven o'clock.

1:00:49.979 --> 1:00:50.688
And, uh,

1:00:52.482 --> 1:00:54.776
uh, it's something
we would do.

1:00:54.859 --> 1:00:56.361
You know,
watch movies.

1:00:56.444 --> 1:01:00.573
And when the movie ended,
we took our wine.

1:01:00.656 --> 1:01:02.575
And, uh, what we
would usually do

1:01:02.658 --> 1:01:06.412
on a nice night
is, um, we would...

1:01:06.496 --> 1:01:09.374
come on,
come on out to the pool.

1:01:10.208 --> 1:01:12.418
Because it's,
I always think about

1:01:12.502 --> 1:01:15.546
um, pretty much
the nicest place

1:01:15.630 --> 1:01:16.756
on the property.

1:01:18.007 --> 1:01:19.884
Uh, keep walking.

1:01:19.967 --> 1:01:20.635
We're doing a wide shot.

1:01:28.684 --> 1:01:30.812
So I stayed out by the pool,

1:01:30.895 --> 1:01:33.439
and Kathleen had
a conference call,

1:01:33.523 --> 1:01:37.026
you know, some kind of
work obligation in the morning.

1:01:44.283 --> 1:01:47.912
So... that was it.

1:01:47.995 --> 1:01:49.455
Down by the pool,

1:01:49.539 --> 1:01:54.168
that was the last time
I saw Kathleen, uh, alive.

1:01:54.252 --> 1:01:57.130
No, she was alive when I,
when I found her here.

1:01:57.213 --> 1:02:00.508
But... barely.

1:02:11.394 --> 1:02:15.481
Michael, um,
making a documentary

1:02:15.565 --> 1:02:18.276
is, is more than filming
and talking.

1:02:18.359 --> 1:02:20.778
It's, it's about
a relationship.

1:02:20.862 --> 1:02:23.823
And you and I, we're just
getting to know each other huh?

1:02:23.906 --> 1:02:26.033
So it's always

1:02:26.117 --> 1:02:28.578
a little strained
in the beginning.

1:02:28.661 --> 1:02:31.164
You thought
I was strained?

1:02:31.247 --> 1:02:32.957
We'll just do it again.

1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:34.750
-Do it again?
-Yes.

1:02:34.834 --> 1:02:38.546
With, um,
with more emotion.

1:02:38.629 --> 1:02:40.506
I want to see
how you really feel.

1:02:40.590 --> 1:02:42.508
I just told you how I feel.

1:02:44.051 --> 1:02:45.720
Yes, of course.
Of course. But, um...

1:02:47.763 --> 1:02:49.515
when you go to bed
at night, you know,

1:02:49.599 --> 1:02:53.060
and, uh, and the room
becomes dark

1:02:53.144 --> 1:02:55.354
and you start thinking
about your wife.

1:02:55.438 --> 1:02:58.024
No. No, I'm not going
to prostrate myself

1:02:58.107 --> 1:02:59.525
for the sake of your film.

1:02:59.609 --> 1:03:00.818
Okay? You go talk
to the DA for that.

1:03:02.987 --> 1:03:04.405
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

1:03:07.116 --> 1:03:08.784
Who's that?

1:03:08.868 --> 1:03:09.952
That's my mother.

1:03:11.621 --> 1:03:13.331
I mean, Patty told me she booked
a room at the Holiday Inn,

1:03:13.414 --> 1:03:14.707
I didn't believe her.

1:03:15.833 --> 1:03:17.126
Hello!

1:03:17.210 --> 1:03:18.377
I saw that you were busy,

1:03:18.461 --> 1:03:20.796
and I didn't want to bother you.

1:03:33.559 --> 1:03:35.811
You did the right thing.

1:03:39.315 --> 1:03:41.651
I know Kathleen loved
those girls, but...

1:03:42.902 --> 1:03:44.946
they're a lost cause now.

1:03:46.155 --> 1:03:47.532
You know that
she'd been laying there

1:03:47.615 --> 1:03:49.200
a whole hour
before she died?

1:03:50.701 --> 1:03:53.204
Do you think she was
in a lot of pain?

1:03:57.750 --> 1:03:59.377
Oh my god.

1:04:02.296 --> 1:04:03.631
Oh my god.

1:04:05.716 --> 1:04:07.677
Oh my god.

1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:09.345
What are you doing?

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:12.974
That son of a bitch.

1:04:14.016 --> 1:04:15.226
What are you doing?

1:04:20.898 --> 1:04:23.776
-Candace!
-What are you doing?

1:04:25.903 --> 1:04:27.989
-Candace, stop!

1:04:30.950 --> 1:04:32.368
-- Candace, stop!
-- Candace!

1:04:32.451 --> 1:04:35.162
You're scaring us.

1:04:37.039 --> 1:04:37.915
Son of a bitch.

1:04:41.335 --> 1:04:43.713
That son of a bitch
used the blow poke.

1:04:46.215 --> 1:04:48.342
That son of a bitch
used the blow poke!
