00:04.504 --> 00:06.505
Oh, that must be
bud's new truck.

00:06.506 --> 00:09.307
I told you
he was getting one.
Yeah.

00:11.844 --> 00:12.910
Hi, mr. Harper.

00:12.911 --> 00:15.080
So, what brings you
out on location?

00:15.081 --> 00:17.082
What brings me out here

00:17.083 --> 00:20.485
Is I'm your boss
and I sign your paycheck.

00:20.486 --> 00:23.321
And what lovely penmanship
you have, sir.

00:23.322 --> 00:25.490
Al, nobody likes
a suck-up.

00:25.491 --> 00:27.425
Oh, by the way, tim,

00:27.426 --> 00:29.660
Thanks for the custom
gear-shift knob

00:29.661 --> 00:32.030
You got me for my truck.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.099
It's ok, boss.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.701
Bud, there's a telephone call
for you inside.

00:36.702 --> 00:37.936
Thanks, heidi.
Sure.

00:37.937 --> 00:39.938
All right, al,
once we go on the air,

00:39.939 --> 00:41.939
I'll go up and nail
that facia board

00:41.940 --> 00:44.743
And you'll give the tips
on winter painting,
all right?

00:44.744 --> 00:47.946
Be careful. You don't
want to drop anything
on bud's new truck.

00:47.947 --> 00:50.715
Well, why don't you
just move it?

00:50.716 --> 00:53.785
Heidi, I'll need
some masking tape.
Sure. Here you go.

00:53.786 --> 00:56.388
Thanks.
Hey, tim!

00:56.389 --> 00:59.891
This new gear-shift knob
doesn't have any numbers
or letters on it.

00:59.892 --> 01:01.626
Which one is reverse?

01:01.627 --> 01:04.796
Uh, over and down.

01:04.797 --> 01:08.233
No, up and over that -

01:08.234 --> 01:10.302
Ok, my left.
Your left would be -

01:10.303 --> 01:13.404
My - my left.

01:13.405 --> 01:14.606
Yeah.

01:19.045 --> 01:21.012
Aah!

01:24.183 --> 01:27.552
Tim!
Are you all right?

01:27.553 --> 01:31.456
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
The truck broke my fall.

01:32.658 --> 01:35.526
<i>(groans)</i>
oh, no,
look at this truck.

01:35.527 --> 01:38.830
Do you think we can
clean the paint off
before bud sees it?

01:38.831 --> 01:40.432
Oh, no!

02:30.082 --> 02:33.585
Hey, mark, lookin' good.

02:33.586 --> 02:37.455
Thanks.
I only got one more decal
to put on, and I'm done.

02:37.456 --> 02:40.024
How are you doin'?
What do you think?

02:42.695 --> 02:44.930
Doesn't really
look like a spitfire.

02:44.931 --> 02:47.932
That's because it's
a combination spitfire
and mustang.

02:47.933 --> 02:53.371
I don't what to call it -
a spitstang or a musfire.

02:53.372 --> 02:56.675
I've never seen mag wheels
on a plane before.

02:56.676 --> 03:01.046
Or a real spoiler
and dual exhaust. Huh?

03:01.047 --> 03:03.381
Why would you need
all that stuff?

03:03.382 --> 03:07.485
In case you pull up
next to a guy on a cloud
who wants to race, that's why.

03:07.486 --> 03:10.021
Hi, guys.
Hi, honey.

03:10.022 --> 03:13.224
Dad and I finished
building our planes.

03:13.225 --> 03:14.558
Oh, wow.

03:14.559 --> 03:18.697
Mark, your spitfire
looks great.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.197
How about mine?

03:25.204 --> 03:28.873
I think
you should spit on it
and set it on fire.

03:28.874 --> 03:31.776
I think this is the best one
I've made so far.

03:31.777 --> 03:34.445
I'm gonna go put it
with my others.
It's beautiful.

03:34.446 --> 03:36.480
I'm so glad
you found a hobby.

03:36.481 --> 03:39.517
It is so great he finally
found something he likes doing.

03:39.518 --> 03:41.453
No one could be happier
than me.

03:41.454 --> 03:44.623
One thing I've always said
about my boys - if they
can't learn to love cars,

03:44.624 --> 03:48.093
Please, god,
let them love something
with an engine.

03:48.094 --> 03:50.928
You know
where you could take him?
The yankee air museum.

03:50.929 --> 03:54.266
I just read they're having
some kind of special exhibit.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.167
That's a great idea.
I'll take him Saturday.

03:56.168 --> 04:00.738
I won't have to suffer
through one of your
piano lessons again.

04:00.739 --> 04:03.008
Excuse me.
Did you say "suffer"?

04:03.009 --> 04:05.242
Well, suffer in a good way.

04:07.346 --> 04:11.215
We all know that... Suffering
makes us stronger.

04:13.819 --> 04:17.956
Tim, do you have any idea
how lame that was?

04:17.957 --> 04:20.725
I'm never sure
till I'm done.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.666
<i>(â™ª beethoven's</i>
<i>"moonlight" sonata)</i>

04:40.780 --> 04:42.980
<i>(plays wrong note)</i>

04:45.984 --> 04:48.219
<i>(wrong chords)</i>

05:01.133 --> 05:03.501
<i>(wrong notes)</i>

05:03.502 --> 05:06.738
You know, I really need
to get this piano tuned.

05:06.739 --> 05:09.773
I don't think
it's the piano.

05:09.774 --> 05:12.376
You obviously
haven't been practicing.

05:12.377 --> 05:14.678
Oh, yes, I have.
Thirty minutes a day?

05:14.679 --> 05:16.014
Yes.
Every day?

05:16.015 --> 05:17.315
Every day, almost.

05:17.316 --> 05:19.851
Which means
once a week.

05:19.852 --> 05:23.254
And when she is playing,
she's usually talking
on the phone.

05:24.923 --> 05:28.525
Complaining how annoying
her teacher is.

05:28.526 --> 05:29.728
Really?

05:29.729 --> 05:33.564
No! No, not you.
That's my psychology teacher.

05:33.565 --> 05:36.134
Thanks a lot, boys.
You've been a big help.

05:36.135 --> 05:38.202
Hey, any time.

05:38.203 --> 05:43.107
Jill, why do you want
to play the piano?

05:43.108 --> 05:47.145
Well, um,
when I was a child,

05:47.146 --> 05:50.548
Everybody said
that I showed a lot of promise.

05:50.549 --> 05:53.885
Apparently that promise
has been broken.

05:56.021 --> 05:58.022
Are you saying
I should just give up?

05:58.023 --> 06:00.859
No, I'm saying
that if you want
to learn to play,

06:00.860 --> 06:04.295
You have to commit to it
and focus.

06:04.296 --> 06:06.330
I am focused.
I'm focused!

06:06.331 --> 06:08.733
I just - I have
a very hectic schedule.

06:08.734 --> 06:13.337
I have three boys,
and my husband is insane,
and I go to school.

06:13.338 --> 06:17.342
I had tons of homework
this week -
can it!

06:17.343 --> 06:19.276
I've been teaching
for 50 years.

06:19.277 --> 06:21.979
I've heard every excuse
in the book.

06:21.980 --> 06:26.050
"I broke a nail."
"dog ate my music."

06:26.051 --> 06:30.054
"had to go fight
in world war ii."

06:30.055 --> 06:34.325
Fighting for your country
is not a good excuse?

06:34.326 --> 06:35.960
Not for me.

06:35.961 --> 06:38.830
Jill, I have no tolerance
for slackers.

06:38.831 --> 06:40.932
If you want
to be my student,

06:40.933 --> 06:44.401
You have to practice
30 minutes every day

06:44.402 --> 06:47.839
And focus, focus, <i>focus.</i>

06:47.840 --> 06:51.376
You know, I love
what you're doing
with your hair.

06:52.778 --> 06:55.379
<i>(playing badly)</i>

07:00.986 --> 07:02.987
Man, I thought
when you practice,

07:02.988 --> 07:04.889
You're supposed
to get better.

07:04.890 --> 07:09.727
That only works if you have
a little thing called talent.

07:09.728 --> 07:13.297
You know,
maybe it's just us.

07:14.899 --> 07:18.802
<i>(wrong notes)</i>

07:18.803 --> 07:21.606
It's not us.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.609
Hey, I've got an idea.
Come on.

07:24.610 --> 07:28.546
Hey, mom, the music
sounds fantastic.

07:28.547 --> 07:29.981
You think?

07:29.982 --> 07:32.350
I actually thought
I was listening
to a radio.

07:32.351 --> 07:35.386
Well, I still have
the rest of the half-hour
to do, you know.

07:35.387 --> 07:38.790
I gotta play this...
Four more times.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.593
That would be
a big mistake.

07:41.594 --> 07:43.428
Really? How come?

07:43.429 --> 07:46.231
There is a danger
in over-practicing.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.566
There's a bigger danger

07:48.567 --> 07:52.637
In trying to pull a fast one
on your mother.

07:52.638 --> 07:56.007
Now listen, guys,
I'm going to play this
until I get it right.

07:56.008 --> 07:58.042
All right,
but don't blame us

07:58.043 --> 08:01.112
When you miss
your grandchildren's
weddings.

08:16.195 --> 08:19.464
Sounds great, honey.
I thought I was listening
to the radio.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.134
Brad and randy
already tried that.

08:23.135 --> 08:25.169
Really?
Did they try this?

08:25.170 --> 08:29.407
If you don't stop playing
that piano, I'm going to
kill myself.

08:29.408 --> 08:33.111
No, they didn't.
How was the airplane museum?

08:33.111 --> 08:35.913
The best. You should see
what they have there, mom.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.914
A b-52 stratofortress
and our favorite -

08:37.916 --> 08:43.354
An f-102 delta dagger,
and best of all,
no piano.

08:43.355 --> 08:45.756
And they let us go up
in one of those
turboprops.

08:45.757 --> 08:49.460
Ooh, one of those
simulator things?
No, a little plane.

08:49.461 --> 08:52.397
You took him
up in a little plane?
<i>(both)</i> yeah.

08:52.398 --> 08:55.066
Those things are disasters
waiting to happen.

08:55.067 --> 08:59.003
They're like <i>tool time</i>
with wings.

08:59.004 --> 09:00.638
No, they're not.

09:00.639 --> 09:03.141
Dad said I could
take flying lessons

09:03.142 --> 09:05.577
If you said it was ok.

09:05.578 --> 09:09.614
Oh. Did he?

09:09.615 --> 09:13.017
He might have.

09:13.018 --> 09:15.186
So, what do you say?

09:15.187 --> 09:17.521
I say that this is
one of those things

09:17.522 --> 09:20.190
Your father and I
need to discuss in private.

09:20.191 --> 09:22.793
Ok, but just remember,

09:22.794 --> 09:26.396
I've never wanted
to do anything more
in my entire life.

09:29.567 --> 09:34.972
Only you could turn
a trip to the museum
into a journey to death.

09:34.973 --> 09:37.474
Before you get
all bent out of shape,

09:37.475 --> 09:40.477
Let's just take a look
at the facts in here.
No, here is a fact.

09:40.478 --> 09:42.980
There is no one
who's going to convince me

09:42.981 --> 09:45.850
That an 11-year-old child
should be taking flying lessons.

09:45.851 --> 09:48.853
They teach a lot of kids
how to fly, a lot of them
younger than mark.

09:48.854 --> 09:50.555
That doesn't make it safe.

09:50.556 --> 09:53.224
They have a lot of sistis-
sti- sis- stit-

09:53.225 --> 09:56.760
There's sta- stistis-
there's ta-ta-ta-

09:56.761 --> 10:00.698
There's facts in here
that show that flying
a small plane

10:00.699 --> 10:03.301
Is safer
than driving a car.

10:03.302 --> 10:06.104
Well, sure,
the way you drive.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.539
Look, he'd be trained
by a highly experienced
instructor

10:08.540 --> 10:10.874
Who's logged over 1,00 hours
in this plane.

10:10.875 --> 10:12.876
I don't care
if it's a million hours.

10:12.877 --> 10:17.014
It only takes ten seconds
to crash.
Honey, honey, honey,

10:17.015 --> 10:20.384
We in the aviation
business...

10:20.385 --> 10:22.486
Don't use the word "crash."

10:22.487 --> 10:25.189
It sounds so negative.

10:25.190 --> 10:29.293
Well, honey, some of us
think a plane going down
in flames

10:29.294 --> 10:31.963
Is kind of a negative thing.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.198
These planes
are perfectly safe.
They're checked.

10:34.199 --> 10:37.168
Every 100 hours,
they inspect the engine,
the airframe.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.002
Do they inspect
the brains of the parents

10:39.003 --> 10:41.972
Who sign their kids up
for these classes?
Maybe. Read the brochure.

10:41.973 --> 10:44.075
I haven't read
the whole thing.

10:44.076 --> 10:46.577
There is no way
I'm gonna let mark do this.

10:46.578 --> 10:48.946
He's finally found something
he likes to do.

10:48.947 --> 10:51.682
He's got a hobby now.
No, fishing is a hobby.

10:51.683 --> 10:54.184
Building model planes -
that's a hobby.

10:54.185 --> 10:57.989
Flying kamikaze missions
over detroit - not a hobby.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.924
Kamikaze missions?

10:59.925 --> 11:02.927
You know what happens
when a mother babies
her son like this?

11:02.928 --> 11:04.628
He turns into al.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.199
So, can I take
flying lessons?

11:09.200 --> 11:12.136
I'm sorry, honey,
but your father and I
discussed it,

11:12.137 --> 11:16.340
And <i>we</i> decided
that it's really
not a good idea.

11:16.341 --> 11:20.478
In other words,
mom said no and you caved.

11:21.713 --> 11:23.681
I didn't cave. She thi-

11:23.682 --> 11:27.485
She and I...
Think it'd be better
if you got a little older

11:27.486 --> 11:29.487
To take these lessons.

11:29.488 --> 11:30.922
How old?

11:30.923 --> 11:34.024
Ever heard of a man
named methuselah?

11:40.599 --> 11:43.601
Hi there. Welcome back
to a very special <i>tool time.</i>

11:43.602 --> 11:46.604
Al, I guess we should move
back to our interview area.

11:46.605 --> 11:49.607
Better yet, let's have
the interview area move to us.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.642
Good idea. Heidi,
the interview area, please.

11:51.643 --> 11:54.078
Here you go, tim.

12:01.620 --> 12:04.021
Two years ago,
we were fortunate enough

12:04.022 --> 12:06.223
To have the crew
of the space shuttle <i>endeavour.</i>

12:06.224 --> 12:08.225
Today we're honored
to meet the crew

12:08.226 --> 12:10.061
Of the space shuttle
<i>columbia.</i>

12:10.062 --> 12:11.762
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

12:15.834 --> 12:18.069
It's amazing
that they're here, right?

12:18.070 --> 12:20.571
Yes, it is, especially
after you tried to steal

12:20.572 --> 12:22.573
One of the <i>endeavour</i> crew's
space tools.

12:22.574 --> 12:26.043
I borrowed it in case
I was taking my family
to the gas giant.

12:26.044 --> 12:28.913
That would be jupiter,
not your mother.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.949
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's have a warm welcome

12:31.950 --> 12:35.086
For the crew
of the space shuttle <i>columbia.</i>

12:35.087 --> 12:37.688
<i>(cheers and whistles)</i>

12:56.141 --> 12:58.008
First let's welcome
ken bowersox,

12:58.009 --> 13:00.344
Who's been here
with us before
on <i>tool time.</i>

13:00.345 --> 13:02.212
He was with <i>endeavour</i>
last time.

13:02.213 --> 13:04.248
Welcome aboard.
Thank you, tim.

13:04.249 --> 13:07.451
For the record,
I'd like to say that
you did try to steal that tool.

13:07.452 --> 13:09.854
And for the record,
I'd just like to say

13:09.855 --> 13:12.189
"bowersox" is still
a real funny name.

13:13.792 --> 13:16.027
Next to ken
is cady coleman.

13:16.028 --> 13:18.563
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

13:18.564 --> 13:20.364
And next to her,
kathryn thornton,

13:20.365 --> 13:23.834
Who's spent
over 1,000 hours in space.

13:23.835 --> 13:25.436
That's right, tim.

13:27.405 --> 13:30.341
Tim, and 21 of those hours
were outside the cabin.

13:30.342 --> 13:33.043
Anything to get away
from ken, huh?

13:33.044 --> 13:34.945
No, tim,
we were doing things

13:34.946 --> 13:37.448
Like trying to repair
the hubble space telescope.

13:37.449 --> 13:40.751
Aw, you don't have to
cover for him.

13:40.752 --> 13:42.319
And last but not least

13:42.320 --> 13:46.890
Payload specialists
fred leslie and <i>al</i> sacco.

13:49.928 --> 13:52.496
Let me ask a question
I'm sure most of us
want to know.

13:52.497 --> 13:55.266
Do your mothers
worry about you being
in outer space? Ken?

13:55.267 --> 13:58.302
No, my mom never has a problem
with me orbiting around
the earth.

13:58.303 --> 14:01.305
She only gets nervous
when I fly in those
small airplanes.

14:01.306 --> 14:06.043
<i>(mutters)</i> ...Jill, I'm sure
he's just kidding around.

14:06.044 --> 14:09.747
So, al,
guess what I have in common
with all these astronauts.

14:09.748 --> 14:12.249
You've all had a fire lit
under your butt

14:12.250 --> 14:14.818
And shot into space?

14:14.819 --> 14:16.420
Well, that, and a ph.D.

14:16.421 --> 14:19.423
If you remember
a couple months ago,
I got a ph.D.

14:19.424 --> 14:21.425
All the astronauts
also have ph.D.'s.

14:21.426 --> 14:23.427
Actually, tim,
that's not true.

14:23.428 --> 14:25.596
Everyone has one
but me.

14:25.597 --> 14:28.332
Well, isn't that
a shame, ken?

14:28.333 --> 14:31.369
Do you guys razz him
for not havin'
a doctorate?

14:31.370 --> 14:33.971
No, we don't, tim.
Why not?

14:33.972 --> 14:37.375
'cause he's
the commander.

14:37.376 --> 14:41.011
Fred, why don't you tell us
a little something about
what you guys did up there?

14:41.012 --> 14:44.548
Al, we had a 16-day mission,
where we conducted a number
of scientific experiments.

14:44.549 --> 14:47.385
And we focused on things
like the physics of fluids.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.419
<i>(chuckles)</i>
give me a couple beers,

14:49.420 --> 14:53.824
I'll teach you
all you need to know
about physics of fluids.

14:53.825 --> 14:56.994
Then I guess our mission
was completely unnecessary.

15:02.901 --> 15:04.801
Before the astronauts
went up in space,

15:04.802 --> 15:07.003
I put a little
care package together
for nasa -

15:07.004 --> 15:08.672
A special screwdriver
I made

15:08.673 --> 15:10.675
And some classic episodes
of <i>tool time.</i>

15:10.676 --> 15:13.477
They came in very handy.
Who got to use
the screwdriver?

15:13.478 --> 15:16.647
That was me, and I
brought along a videotape
of me using it in space.

15:16.648 --> 15:18.815
Thanks, kathryn.
Heidi, let's take
a look at it.

15:24.422 --> 15:26.257
Congratulations, tim,

15:26.258 --> 15:29.159
On your first
intergalactic screwup.

15:31.129 --> 15:33.998
Well, you enjoyed
the <i>tool time</i> episodes,
didn't ya?

15:33.999 --> 15:37.034
We watched 'em every night.
It really helped us unwind
after a hard day in space.

15:37.035 --> 15:39.303
<i>(tim)</i> let's take a look
at that.

15:39.304 --> 15:41.438
Ah, the porta-potti episode.

15:41.439 --> 15:44.041
<i>(al on video) ...Truly</i>
<i>the unsung hero...</i>

15:47.979 --> 15:50.281
We never slept better, tim.

15:58.156 --> 16:01.091
<i>(muted notes)</i>

16:07.565 --> 16:09.133
Brad!

16:10.235 --> 16:12.336
Randy!

16:12.337 --> 16:14.238
Yeah, mom?

16:14.239 --> 16:16.807
How do you explain this?

16:16.808 --> 16:19.276
We were looking
for the hamper

16:19.277 --> 16:21.378
In the middle
of the night,

16:21.379 --> 16:24.315
And obviously
we were a little off.

16:28.152 --> 16:30.120
Am I that bad?

16:30.121 --> 16:31.922
Let me put it this way.

16:31.923 --> 16:35.092
Have you ever seen us
pick up our dirty laundry
before?

16:35.093 --> 16:38.094
No, you're right,
but now you can pick it up

16:38.095 --> 16:41.198
And go put it
on the washing machine, ok?

16:46.004 --> 16:48.471
Hi, mark.

16:48.472 --> 16:50.674
You're still not talking
to me?

16:50.675 --> 16:54.011
Ohh, honey. Look, look.

16:54.012 --> 16:56.013
I got you something
really cool.

16:56.014 --> 16:59.316
This is
a p-38 lightning.
Keep it.

16:59.317 --> 17:01.485
I don't care about planes
anymore.

17:01.486 --> 17:03.988
Well, couldn't you
find another hobby?

17:03.989 --> 17:06.323
Like what,
stamp collecting?

17:06.324 --> 17:08.892
Well, that'd be good.
Or coins. Or paperweights.

17:08.893 --> 17:11.962
I, as a child,
collected butterflies.

17:11.963 --> 17:15.031
I, as a child,
could care less.

17:24.642 --> 17:27.545
<i>(grunts)</i>

17:27.546 --> 17:29.112
Wilson?

17:32.551 --> 17:34.819
Well, hi-ho,
good neighbor.

17:38.723 --> 17:41.158
Are you trying
to get pneumonia

17:41.159 --> 17:45.629
Or rehearsing for a production
of <i>no, no, nanette?</i>

17:45.630 --> 17:48.699
No, no, no, jill.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.435
Have you ever heard
of the polar bear club?

17:51.436 --> 17:55.139
Yeah, it's that group
of maniacs that swim
in the middle of winter.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.274
Well, say hello
to the head maniac.

17:58.710 --> 18:01.112
Boy, this could be
an invigorating hobby.

18:01.113 --> 18:04.381
At least it's less dangerous
than the one mark wants to have.

18:04.382 --> 18:06.484
He wants
to take flying lessons.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.752
Oh. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.

18:08.753 --> 18:11.455
And tim is trying
to convince me
of how safe it is.

18:11.456 --> 18:13.924
As an experienced pilot,
I can assure you

18:13.925 --> 18:16.693
That learning with
a licensed instructor
is quite safe.

18:16.694 --> 18:19.196
I didn't know
you were a pilot.
Oh, yes, indeedy.

18:19.197 --> 18:22.867
I've logged over 1,000 hours
since I flew spy planes
during the war.

18:22.868 --> 18:25.669
You were a spy?

18:25.670 --> 18:27.171
Which war?

18:27.172 --> 18:29.706
I'm not at liberty to say.

18:31.510 --> 18:36.313
Well, I just hate the idea
of mark flying in those planes.

18:36.314 --> 18:39.316
My father flew in those
small military planes
all the time...

18:39.317 --> 18:41.318
Right.
...And even though
it was peacetime,

18:41.319 --> 18:44.421
My mother was always
a basket case until he got back.

18:44.422 --> 18:46.089
You know, we all were.

18:46.090 --> 18:48.926
Well, jill,
from what you tell me
of your family,

18:48.927 --> 18:51.895
I am reminded
of the behavior of baboons.

18:53.765 --> 18:56.166
The studies have shown
that the offspring
of baboons

18:56.167 --> 18:58.001
Pick up
their parents' fears

18:58.002 --> 19:00.337
Whether those fears
are justified or not.

19:00.338 --> 19:02.672
So you're saying
that I'm afraid for mark

19:02.673 --> 19:05.175
Because my mother
projected her fears onto me.

19:05.176 --> 19:07.211
Well, I can't say that
for sure.

19:07.212 --> 19:10.014
Jill, have you ever been
up in a small plane?

19:10.015 --> 19:11.915
Of course.

19:11.916 --> 19:15.352
The dumbo ride
at disney world.

19:15.353 --> 19:17.821
Well, I think
what would really help you

19:17.822 --> 19:20.224
Is to take a ride
in a small aircraft

19:20.225 --> 19:22.793
Just to see how darn safe
they really are.

19:22.794 --> 19:26.196
I don't think so.
I'd be too scared.

19:26.197 --> 19:30.834
Well, are you really scared,
or are you just echoing
your mother's fears?

19:30.835 --> 19:32.569
I don't know.

19:32.570 --> 19:36.140
I'd hate to think
that I was passing my fears
on to the kids, though.

19:36.141 --> 19:39.009
Thanks to their father,
they're already afraid
of glues, hammers

19:39.010 --> 19:41.679
And anything in reverse.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.547
Well, I'd be glad
to take you up.

19:44.548 --> 19:47.918
It's just that
there are a few countries
I can't fly over.

19:49.854 --> 19:51.288
Which ones?

19:51.289 --> 19:54.191
I'm not at liberty to say.

19:58.129 --> 20:00.230
How am I doin', wilson?

20:00.231 --> 20:02.099
Very well.

20:04.635 --> 20:07.704
Especially for someone
who's never taken
a flying lesson.

20:07.705 --> 20:10.173
You seem to have
a natural aptitude.

20:10.174 --> 20:11.675
He sure does.

20:11.676 --> 20:14.811
Hey, mark, watch out
for the skydiver
by the crosswalk!

20:14.812 --> 20:16.313
<i>(laughs)</i>

20:16.314 --> 20:18.549
How's it goin'
back there, jill?

20:18.550 --> 20:19.849
Pretty good!

20:19.850 --> 20:22.686
It's not near as scary
as I thought it would be.

20:22.687 --> 20:24.254
Well, then perhaps
you'd consider

20:24.255 --> 20:26.924
Removing your fingernails
from my thigh.

20:26.925 --> 20:29.126
Sorry.

20:29.127 --> 20:31.194
This is really cool,
isn't it, mom?

20:31.195 --> 20:33.464
Way cool!

20:33.465 --> 20:35.365
Boy, you can sure see
a lot of stuff.

20:35.366 --> 20:38.035
Look, the silverdome's
over -
aah!

20:38.036 --> 20:39.269
Whoops!
Oh-oh.

20:39.270 --> 20:40.938
What'd I do?

20:40.939 --> 20:42.705
"whoops" is not a word
I want to hear

20:42.706 --> 20:44.807
2,000 feet up in the air.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.543
<i>(engine dies)</i>

20:46.544 --> 20:49.213
Oh, my god. Oh, my god,
what's happening?

20:49.214 --> 20:52.916
Tim hit the mixture control,
which caused the engine to die.

20:52.917 --> 20:55.019
"die" is even worse
than "whoops"!

20:55.020 --> 20:57.054
Don't panic, jill.

20:57.055 --> 20:59.623
I'll just readjust
the mixture,

20:59.624 --> 21:02.092
And I'll level
the course.

21:02.093 --> 21:05.462
There, that's better.

21:05.463 --> 21:08.798
I'm sorry, everybody.
Is there something
I can do, wilson?

21:08.799 --> 21:11.902
Well, actually, tim,
there's a very special job
I have for you.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.204
Great. What is it?
Take your hands...

21:14.205 --> 21:18.274
Got 'em.
Place them firmly
under your butt...

21:18.275 --> 21:19.510
Ok.

21:19.511 --> 21:23.781
...And leave them there
for the rest of the flight.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.517
So, mom, can I
take flying lessons?

21:26.518 --> 21:30.620
Yeah... As long as you
leave your father home.

21:30.621 --> 21:32.856
Wilson, can we land now?

21:32.857 --> 21:35.759
Land? I never learned
how to do that.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.194
Oh, no.

21:37.195 --> 21:38.996
He's kidding.

21:38.997 --> 21:42.565
You're kiddin', right?
I'm not at liberty to say.

21:46.137 --> 21:49.339
<i>(playing badly)</i>

21:59.116 --> 22:03.653
What happened
to focus, focus, focus?

22:03.654 --> 22:07.858
It went out the window,
window, window.

22:07.859 --> 22:11.427
Jill, you were supposed
to practice every day.

22:11.428 --> 22:13.964
I... I tried, I tried,
but my kids,

22:13.965 --> 22:19.102
They just kept stuffing
their dirty laundry
in my piano.

22:19.103 --> 22:21.104
Laundry in the piano?

22:21.105 --> 22:22.539
Yeah. Yeah.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.975
Jill, if you weren't
going to practice,

22:24.976 --> 22:27.343
You might have spent
the time

22:27.344 --> 22:30.013
Coming up
with a better excuse.

22:32.450 --> 22:35.352
You know, bowersox,
up in space,
you may be commander,

22:35.353 --> 22:38.888
But down here,
I am... Mission control.

22:38.889 --> 22:41.591
You guys are good
at getting out of
tight situations?

22:41.592 --> 22:43.593
Try this.

22:53.104 --> 22:56.039
We'll be right back
after these few messages
from binford.
