00:12.298 --> 00:16.134
It's easier
with the lips slightly wet.

00:16.135 --> 00:19.137
In through the nose...

00:19.138 --> 00:21.639
Out through the mouth.

00:21.640 --> 00:25.376
Remember, each breath
is a bridge to another breath.

00:25.377 --> 00:27.845
Each breath is a bridge.

00:27.846 --> 00:31.617
All right, duncan, i think
that's enough for today.

00:36.855 --> 00:38.156
Duncan, listen to me.

00:38.157 --> 00:40.191
Yes, miss rutledge.

00:40.192 --> 00:41.792
Tomorrow's
a really important day, okay?

00:41.793 --> 00:44.129
For both of us.
Everyone's coming.

00:44.130 --> 00:45.630
Your grandmother is coming.

00:45.631 --> 00:49.400
So can you do me
a really big favor, please?

00:49.401 --> 00:51.236
Try and practice
before bed...

00:51.237 --> 00:52.637
Just a little.

00:52.638 --> 00:54.905
I will, certainly.

00:54.906 --> 00:56.741
Um, did your mom leave
a check?

00:56.742 --> 00:58.177
Oh. Yeah.

01:08.554 --> 01:11.289
Ew.

02:17.256 --> 02:18.756
I hope
i wasn't too fast for you.

02:18.757 --> 02:22.394
Oh, no, i thought you were
rather sluggish tonight.

02:24.330 --> 02:26.564
After you, maestro.

02:26.565 --> 02:29.267
Beautiful, as always.
-Thank you. Thank you.

02:29.268 --> 02:31.536
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

02:31.537 --> 02:34.038
Good luck.

02:34.039 --> 02:35.072
Yeah.

02:35.073 --> 02:37.575
Thank you so much.

02:37.576 --> 02:38.576
Joshua bell.

02:38.577 --> 02:42.046
Safe trip to beijing tonight.

02:42.047 --> 02:43.781
Well...

02:43.782 --> 02:45.716
As most of you know,

02:45.717 --> 02:50.120
Tonight's concert
marks the final performance

02:50.121 --> 02:52.357
that i shall give
as the conductor

02:52.358 --> 02:55.360
of this very fine orchestra.

02:55.361 --> 02:57.161
Thank you.

02:57.162 --> 02:58.863
Thank you.

02:58.864 --> 03:01.532
Now, just because
you won't see me here,

03:01.533 --> 03:04.134
It doesn't mean to say
that i won't be here.

03:04.135 --> 03:06.337
In fact,
it's just the opposite.

03:06.338 --> 03:10.275
I have gratefully accepted
the newly minted role

03:10.276 --> 03:14.379
Of executive musical director
Emeritus...

03:14.380 --> 03:16.414
Whatever the hell that means.

03:16.415 --> 03:20.017
Before i do go,
i would just like to say

03:20.018 --> 03:21.319
A heartfelt thanks

03:21.320 --> 03:25.556
To some very special people
here tonight.

03:25.557 --> 03:28.058
They are my colleagues,

03:28.059 --> 03:31.061
My friends...

03:31.062 --> 03:32.630
My family.

03:32.631 --> 03:36.767
They are the men and women
of your symphony.

03:36.768 --> 03:37.935
Please.

03:42.841 --> 03:45.710
And now will you please
warmly welcome

03:45.711 --> 03:47.445
the woman behind the curtain,

03:47.446 --> 03:52.082
the board chairperson herself,
Mrs. Gloria windsor?

03:52.083 --> 03:53.183
Thank you.

03:56.021 --> 03:58.222
Good evening.
Good evening.

03:58.223 --> 04:02.293
Thank you, Thomas,
for everything.

04:02.294 --> 04:04.795
And so...

04:04.796 --> 04:08.499
As one movement ends,
another must begin.

04:12.438 --> 04:15.773
It is my honor
to introduce to you

04:15.774 --> 04:17.841
Someone special.

04:17.843 --> 04:21.446
at 12 years old,
he was the youngest person

04:21.447 --> 04:24.649
To ever win the mahler award
for young conductors.

04:24.650 --> 04:28.353
At 23,
he conducted at la scala.

04:28.354 --> 04:32.289
At 25,
he lifted the oslo symphony

04:32.290 --> 04:33.758
out of bankruptcy

04:33.759 --> 04:38.095
And placed them amongst
the finest on the world stage.

04:40.532 --> 04:43.934
He has been courted

04:43.935 --> 04:45.603
by Boston,

04:45.604 --> 04:50.040
Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Munich,

04:50.041 --> 04:53.344
and we got him.

04:53.345 --> 04:55.846
Please join me
in welcoming a man

04:55.847 --> 04:58.949
who need only be introduced
by his first name,

04:58.950 --> 05:03.053
Your new conductor
and musical director...

05:03.054 --> 05:04.789
Ah!
-Rodrigo!

05:23.008 --> 05:24.409
Mwah.

05:24.410 --> 05:26.711
I love you.

05:26.712 --> 05:28.946
I love you.
I love you.

05:50.035 --> 05:52.369
Oh.

05:54.305 --> 05:55.573
Oh. Aw.

05:55.574 --> 05:58.443
I had to.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

05:58.444 --> 05:59.777
I love you.

05:59.778 --> 06:02.212
Does he also do
children's parties?

06:02.213 --> 06:03.681
I think he's amazing.

06:03.682 --> 06:07.618
That was a great performance
tonight, maestro.

06:07.619 --> 06:09.286
Look, gloria, i love you,

06:09.287 --> 06:11.989
but don't ever
underestimate me.

06:11.990 --> 06:15.159
Darling, i think
you go to the same hairdresser.

06:16.728 --> 06:19.096
So i'm playing this
rich-bitch gig in sag harbor,

06:19.097 --> 06:20.931
And the hostess is working
my shaft, my balls,

06:20.932 --> 06:22.933
My shaft, my balls,
and i'm totally fucking hammered

06:22.934 --> 06:24.669
Off of six glasses
Of riesling,

06:24.670 --> 06:26.170
And then i pass out.

06:26.171 --> 06:27.438
And then...
-Good night, boys.

06:27.439 --> 06:29.206
Good night.
-Good night, cynthia.

06:29.207 --> 06:30.575
And then chomp...

06:30.576 --> 06:32.477
Hey, sexy,
you going downtown?

06:32.478 --> 06:34.812
Oh, i'm sorry, Cynthia.
I'm going uptown.

06:34.813 --> 06:37.247
Shit. I got to be
in times square in ten minutes.

06:37.248 --> 06:38.483
Two-a-nights?

06:38.484 --> 06:41.418
Oh.
Oh, i remember those days.

06:41.419 --> 06:42.687
Here, you take it.

06:42.688 --> 06:45.156
You're fantastic.

06:47.693 --> 06:51.829
Well, bruno,
she played you beautifully.

06:51.830 --> 06:52.663
Ah...

06:52.664 --> 06:54.699
<i>bellissima,</i> eh?

06:54.700 --> 06:56.166
Thomas, darling,

06:56.167 --> 06:57.968
Over here.

06:57.969 --> 06:59.804
Have a good night.

06:59.805 --> 07:02.406
Yes.
Good night, maestro.

07:02.407 --> 07:04.174
Maestro.
-what? What's this?

07:04.175 --> 07:05.510
The press release.
-oh.

07:05.511 --> 07:07.478
They'll need a quote

for this pretty young lady,

08:14.580 --> 08:16.313
Tonight would've been
a disaster.

08:16.314 --> 08:17.715
I owe you.

08:17.716 --> 08:20.050
May i offer you a ride home?
-Easy, bernard.

08:20.051 --> 08:22.119
What's your name?
-I'm hailey.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.689
Hailey, you're coming with me.
-okay.

08:24.690 --> 08:26.991
Deborah...
-You're welcome.

08:26.992 --> 08:27.992
For what?

08:27.993 --> 08:29.727
Keeping bernard
Out of your pants.

08:29.728 --> 08:31.696
I thought i knew
Every oboist in town.

08:31.697 --> 08:33.230
I'm Cynthia.
-Cynthia Taylor, i know.

08:33.231 --> 08:35.164
You're second cello
in the New York symphony.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.500
It's a real honor.

08:36.501 --> 08:38.869
You drink, i hope.

08:38.870 --> 08:39.669
Uh...

08:39.671 --> 08:42.139
To Rodrigo!

08:42.140 --> 08:43.240
Rodrigo!

08:43.241 --> 08:44.474
I just love these ideas.

08:44.475 --> 08:46.311
They're so fresh,
so innovative.

08:49.480 --> 08:53.150
Thomas,
i'm so glad you came.

08:53.151 --> 08:55.686
Can we get a glass of champagne?
-It won't be necessary.

08:55.687 --> 08:58.555
I won't be staying that long.

09:02.761 --> 09:04.595
Is this a joke?

09:07.666 --> 09:11.736
"Under the guidance
of our new conductor,

09:11.737 --> 09:14.038
"Rodrigo Desousa,

09:14.039 --> 09:16.506
"our coming season will feature
some surprising highlights,

09:16.507 --> 09:19.276
"such as turning off
the house lights

09:19.277 --> 09:24.114
and playing selected pieces
in complete darkness."

09:24.115 --> 09:27.284
We hired Rodrigo
to bring new ideas,

09:27.285 --> 09:28.753
A youthful point of view.

09:28.754 --> 09:30.921
You were in on the decision.

09:30.922 --> 09:33.357
You continue to be in on every
decision that we make here.

09:33.358 --> 09:34.759
What next...

09:34.760 --> 09:37.327
"Bring a pet
to the symphony" day?

09:37.328 --> 09:39.830
Our subscribers,
they're not gonna stand for...

09:39.831 --> 09:42.667
Oh, put that champagne down,
sergeant Pepper.

09:42.668 --> 09:45.135
Champagne is for celebrating,

09:45.136 --> 09:47.938
And i don't consider
the erosion

09:47.939 --> 09:50.775
Of a magnificent institution
like this...

09:50.776 --> 09:54.111
Stop being so dramatic.

09:54.112 --> 09:55.512
I'm gonna go.

09:55.513 --> 09:58.348
Thank you, Gloria.
Thank you.

09:58.349 --> 10:01.185
It's been lovely.
Maestro, court, thank you.

10:01.186 --> 10:02.386
Thank you.

10:02.387 --> 10:05.923
Haven't you got anything
to say for yourself?

10:05.924 --> 10:08.660
In english, preferably.

10:20.071 --> 10:23.340
Emily Wu, the first violin...

10:23.341 --> 10:27.745
She played sharp 17 times
in the first movement alone.

10:27.746 --> 10:30.815
And then the horns
came a bar late,

10:30.816 --> 10:32.817
Which completely threw off
the clarinet,

10:32.818 --> 10:34.384
And we weren't able to perceive

10:34.385 --> 10:38.388
Tchaikovsky's desired dynamic
shift from bars 27 to 34.

10:38.389 --> 10:41.458
And Bruno, Bruno Cassel,

10:41.459 --> 10:43.660
the bass player...

10:43.661 --> 10:45.930
He's old.

10:45.931 --> 10:48.666
He can barely hold his bow.

10:49.835 --> 10:52.302
I don't know
who you were torturing more...

10:52.303 --> 10:54.940
Me or him.

10:57.843 --> 11:01.713
You prick.

11:03.882 --> 11:06.417
Changes will be made.

11:07.853 --> 11:10.220
And, maestro,
i hope i don't disappoint you

11:10.221 --> 11:14.826
Or the values
of this great institution.

11:16.494 --> 11:19.196
Hailey rutledge, oboist.

11:19.197 --> 11:21.631
Yeah, that's my parents' idea
of a christmas present, so...

11:21.632 --> 11:23.968
I like the drawing.

11:23.969 --> 11:27.137
So i have
on the rocks for you.

11:27.138 --> 11:30.841
Oh, thank you.
-And a neat for you.

11:30.842 --> 11:33.343
And actually, um,
this round's gonna be on me.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.645
Oh, thank you.
-Yeah, of course. My pleasure.

11:35.646 --> 11:38.216
Thanks.

11:39.484 --> 11:40.951
Cute ass, right?

11:40.952 --> 11:43.620
Totally.

11:43.621 --> 11:45.089
I bet he's a dancer.

11:45.090 --> 11:47.491
They're the best.
-The best?

11:47.492 --> 11:50.795
Anecdotal evidence and
my personal scientific research

11:50.796 --> 11:52.963
Suggest there's
a direct correlation

11:52.964 --> 11:55.532
Between what a man does for
a living and the way he fucks.

11:55.533 --> 11:56.700
Mm.

11:56.701 --> 11:58.435
Violinists, for example...

11:58.436 --> 12:00.070
Yeah, come on.

12:00.071 --> 12:03.875
They tend to come quickly.
it's all those arpeggios.

12:07.445 --> 12:10.815
Percussionists pound you
like you're in a porno.

12:15.253 --> 12:17.121
Kind of fun
for about ten minutes.

12:17.122 --> 12:19.957
Good cardio, though.

12:19.958 --> 12:21.358
What about them?

12:21.359 --> 12:23.260
Pianists... Tricky.

12:23.261 --> 12:25.395
Typically they fall
into two general groups...

12:25.396 --> 12:26.496
Jazz and classical.

12:26.497 --> 12:28.967
I go for jazz.
-Why?

12:30.168 --> 12:33.838
Improvisation...
They play off you.

12:33.839 --> 12:38.642
Also, they're into ensembles.

12:43.949 --> 12:46.516
What about, um, conductors?

12:46.517 --> 12:49.186
Too complicated.

12:49.187 --> 12:53.223
Hailey, oboists are
a rare commodity these days.

12:53.224 --> 12:54.959
Strings, on the other hand...

12:54.960 --> 12:58.595
We're like hyenas fighting
over the same dead animal.

12:58.596 --> 13:00.497
You're really good.

13:00.498 --> 13:01.832
Thank you.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.968
Okay, so can i get you
anything else, ladies?

13:03.969 --> 13:04.969
Your name.

13:04.970 --> 13:06.503
Excuse me?

13:06.504 --> 13:08.172
Your name, skinny jeans.

13:08.173 --> 13:10.107
I'm Alex.

13:10.108 --> 13:12.742
You look like a dancer, Alex.
Am i right?

13:12.743 --> 13:14.845
Yeah, i-i am, actually...
Ballet.

13:14.846 --> 13:16.580
I'm training at juilliard.

13:16.581 --> 13:18.883
Alex, Hailey.
Hailey, Alex.

13:18.884 --> 13:21.151
Hailey is an oboist
from North Carolina.

13:21.152 --> 13:23.520
Alex is a ballet dancer
here in New York.

13:23.521 --> 13:26.556
Nice to meet you.
-Yeah, yeah, you too, Hailey.

13:28.894 --> 13:31.228
Uh, listen, i better be going.

13:31.229 --> 13:34.198
Why don't you, uh, sit down
and the two of you chat awhile?

13:34.199 --> 13:36.433
Oh, well, actually, we could
probably share a cab, so...

13:36.434 --> 13:38.435
I'm not taking a cab,
but i'll call you.

13:38.436 --> 13:40.204
Let's stay in touch.
-Change or, uh...?

13:40.205 --> 13:42.472
Have a fantastic time.
-Oh, thank you.

13:42.473 --> 13:43.740
It's all good.

13:43.741 --> 13:46.543
Your friend's awesome.
What is it, like, an $40 tip?

13:46.544 --> 13:48.113
Yeah.

13:50.515 --> 13:53.483
You don't actually have to stay
here and talk to me.

13:53.484 --> 13:56.020
Well, hey, you know,
i'm actually about to get off.

13:56.021 --> 13:58.455
Uh, a bunch of us are probably
gonna go out later.

13:58.456 --> 13:59.489
Want to come with?

13:59.490 --> 14:00.690
Oh, i'd love that.

14:00.691 --> 14:02.126
I just, um...

14:02.127 --> 14:04.794
I have to get up so early.

14:04.795 --> 14:05.996
Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

14:05.997 --> 14:07.797
All right, well, um...

14:07.798 --> 14:09.233
That's cool.
Enjoy your drink and...

14:09.234 --> 14:10.901
Drinks.
-Drinks, plural.

14:10.902 --> 14:12.336
Yeah.

14:12.337 --> 14:14.439
My loss.

14:21.212 --> 14:24.881
This is a $350.000 cello,
you asshole.

14:24.882 --> 14:26.250
Get in.

14:26.251 --> 14:27.517
Don't treat me like a hooker.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.553
I shouldn't have taught you
how to text.

14:29.554 --> 14:30.554
Pop it.

14:30.555 --> 14:35.326
Ah, my whole world
is falling apart.

14:37.862 --> 14:40.598
He's good, isn't he?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.101
Oh, well, don't tell me
You wouldn't fuck him.

14:44.102 --> 14:47.904
Oh, please. Is this
the kind of night it's gonna be?

14:47.905 --> 14:49.974
Let me out.

14:49.975 --> 14:54.078
Forget that.
keep going.

14:54.079 --> 14:55.879
If you have to ask
the question,

14:55.880 --> 14:57.414
You already know the answer.

14:57.415 --> 14:59.583
Yes, he's good.

14:59.584 --> 15:01.118
He's a monster.

15:01.119 --> 15:02.987
He's making cuts...

15:02.988 --> 15:07.291
Woodwinds and brass for now.

15:07.292 --> 15:10.427
The union will have something
to say about that.

15:10.428 --> 15:13.030
You can't just come in
and install your friends.

15:13.031 --> 15:15.599
Oh, i doubt
he has any friends.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.467
I was him once.

15:17.468 --> 15:20.138
You still are.

15:25.910 --> 15:29.579
Let's get bizet!

15:29.580 --> 15:30.914
Whoo!

15:35.386 --> 15:38.122
Oh, shit!
Look who got here.

15:38.123 --> 15:40.557
This party's about to get
fucked up!

15:44.862 --> 15:46.930
You got to try
my new invention.

15:54.272 --> 15:56.640
I call it the "ganjanome."

15:56.641 --> 15:57.774
Nice.

15:57.775 --> 15:59.876
Okay, i'm gonna go to bed.

15:59.877 --> 16:01.311
Oh, just stay up a while.

16:01.312 --> 16:03.080
Have a drink, relax,
you know, go fucking apeshit.

16:03.081 --> 16:05.915
You go fucking apeshit.
-I am fucking apeshit!

16:05.916 --> 16:07.551
Listen, hot guys
are on their way over.

16:07.552 --> 16:09.853
Do you want me to save you one?
-No.

16:09.854 --> 16:11.188
Well, there's a flutist
out here,

16:11.189 --> 16:12.889
And he wants to play you
in "showdown",

16:12.890 --> 16:15.859
And he thinks he's awesome,
but i think you can destroy him.

16:15.860 --> 16:17.294
No.

16:17.295 --> 16:19.029
He said the oboe was
an undernourished clarinet.

16:19.030 --> 16:21.098
Fuck you, love you,
goodnight, Lizzie.

16:21.099 --> 16:24.234
Hailey! Hailey! Hailey!

16:24.235 --> 16:27.737
Hailey! Hailey! Hailey!

16:29.207 --> 16:31.175
I hate you guys.

16:31.176 --> 16:34.178
All right, okay.
Everybody shut up.

16:34.179 --> 16:35.579
Final bets.

16:35.580 --> 16:37.947
Oh, 20, all right.

16:37.948 --> 16:39.483
Place your bets.

16:39.484 --> 16:42.120
Final bets.

16:50.395 --> 16:53.764
Whoo! Romantic, baby.
-Two shots.

16:59.670 --> 17:02.073
Two shots!

17:07.011 --> 17:09.613
This is
the piano arrangement.

17:09.614 --> 17:12.516
It doesn't matter.

17:31.035 --> 17:33.204
Boom.

17:35.973 --> 17:38.276
Come on, come on, come on.

17:39.177 --> 17:41.312
Oh.
-Baroque. Three shots!

18:03.134 --> 18:04.368
Yeah!

18:04.369 --> 18:06.102
Take that, bitch!

18:06.103 --> 18:08.938
Not bad.

18:15.780 --> 18:18.182
Round and round it goes.

18:18.183 --> 18:20.484
Who knows
where it's gonna end up?

18:36.334 --> 18:38.101
Whoo!

18:57.021 --> 19:00.924
Oh!

19:00.925 --> 19:02.025
Yes.

19:02.026 --> 19:03.327
Yes! Yes!

19:03.328 --> 19:05.094
I got to put pants on.

19:11.769 --> 19:13.537
Shit.

19:13.538 --> 19:15.339
How do i look?
Tranny train wreck?

19:15.340 --> 19:17.974
No, you look fine.
You look totally fine.

19:17.975 --> 19:19.142
Yeah?
-why?

19:19.143 --> 19:20.544
Well,
Those dancers are here.

19:20.545 --> 19:22.379
One of them,
Alex merriweather...

19:22.380 --> 19:25.515
My friend says he's, like,
the hottest thing at juilliard.

19:25.516 --> 19:28.117
I'm gonna seduce him.

19:28.118 --> 19:30.053
What are you talking about?
-So, yeah, it was, like...

19:30.054 --> 19:32.856
It's been incredibly hard
since my boyfriend died.

19:32.857 --> 19:34.358
I've been really lonely.

19:34.359 --> 19:35.792
Hey.
-Hi.

19:35.793 --> 19:38.094
Is it, uh, cool
if i join you guys out here?

19:38.095 --> 19:40.597
Yeah, i'm Lizzie.
this is my place.

19:40.598 --> 19:42.666
That's my roommate.
-Hey.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.033
Yeah, we met.

19:44.034 --> 19:45.602
I'm sorry
about your boyfriend.

19:45.603 --> 19:48.572
That's... That's horrible.
How'd he die?

19:48.573 --> 19:49.939
Ebola.

19:49.940 --> 19:52.909
I got it, too,
but i made it.

19:54.312 --> 19:56.380
Lizzie,
you better get in here.

19:56.381 --> 19:59.383
There's kind of an emergency...
Vomit in your victrola.

19:59.384 --> 20:02.452
Oh, fuck!
That's an antique!

20:02.453 --> 20:03.920
Most victrolas are antiques.

20:03.921 --> 20:06.222
I'm just gonna purel
this bitch right quick,

20:06.223 --> 20:07.958
And, um, i'll find you.

20:17.768 --> 20:19.803
You want some?

20:19.804 --> 20:22.706
Oh, no, thanks.
Smoke is the enemy.

20:22.707 --> 20:25.309
Shit. Sorry.

20:25.310 --> 20:28.011
Oh, it's freezing.

20:28.012 --> 20:29.546
Oh, here.

20:29.547 --> 20:34.384
So... So you play just, like,
unbelievably well.

20:34.385 --> 20:37.220
Thanks.

20:37.221 --> 20:41.258
North Carolina, right?
I'm from Nashville.

20:42.427 --> 20:44.694
That's kinda close,
i guess.

20:44.695 --> 20:45.695
Yeah.

20:45.696 --> 20:47.263
Yeah.

20:47.264 --> 20:49.967
Kind of.

20:55.840 --> 20:59.776
It's a pretty
overwhelming place, huh?

20:59.777 --> 21:02.446
Totally.

21:02.447 --> 21:05.415
I feel like all i spend
my time doing

21:05.416 --> 21:08.352
Is, like, figuring out
how to make money

21:08.353 --> 21:11.521
And then figuring out
how to be a good roommate

21:11.522 --> 21:12.822
and a good daughter,

21:12.823 --> 21:16.225
and, like, none of it
is about the art.

21:16.226 --> 21:17.961
So when i'm successful...

21:17.962 --> 21:18.962
You think it'll be easier?

21:18.963 --> 21:21.999
It better be.

21:23.468 --> 21:25.702
You know...

21:25.703 --> 21:28.772
I've always
wondered something.

21:28.773 --> 21:32.241
Do your lips hurt
after you play like that?

21:32.242 --> 21:36.245
Um, i mean,
they used to.

21:36.246 --> 21:37.647
But now i guess they're, like,

21:37.648 --> 21:41.619
Kind of used
to being used, so...

21:48.593 --> 21:52.462
That shit
was fucking disgusting.

21:52.463 --> 21:55.532
And hank had an accident
on your bed too.

21:55.533 --> 21:59.035
Oh, shit.
Okay, thanks for your scarf.

21:59.036 --> 22:01.739
Sorry.

22:04.442 --> 22:07.611
It's freezing outside
my apartment.

22:07.612 --> 22:10.480
Feel like my tits
are gonna fall off.

22:10.481 --> 22:13.583
'Cause they're frozen.

22:13.584 --> 22:15.351
Can i borrow that?

22:26.897 --> 22:29.833
Oh, my god.

22:29.834 --> 22:33.903
What the fuck, mom?
-Sorry.

22:49.286 --> 22:51.354
I sound horrible.
I suck.

22:51.355 --> 22:52.789
But i practiced last night.

22:52.790 --> 22:54.323
I focused on my breathing
like you said.

22:54.324 --> 22:56.726
Duncan, shut up.
Just... Just shut up.

22:56.727 --> 22:58.462
Get me a glass of water.

22:58.463 --> 23:01.931
I'm extremely hungover,
and i'm not proud of it.

23:03.834 --> 23:07.605
Okay, i know.

23:09.674 --> 23:11.575
Each breath is a bridge
to another breath.

23:12.677 --> 23:14.210
Hailey, it's cynthia.

23:14.211 --> 23:16.145
I don't care what the hell
you're doing right now.

23:16.146 --> 23:18.314
Drop it and get over
to the symphony hall.

23:18.315 --> 23:19.549
Rodrigo is holding auditions.

23:19.550 --> 23:20.850
They're seeing woodwinds
until 11:00.

23:20.851 --> 23:22.819
You didn't hear it from me.

23:22.820 --> 23:25.689
I can't fucking believe
this is happening.

23:25.690 --> 23:28.858
Okay, where were we?

23:28.859 --> 23:30.760
Hailey, go.

23:30.761 --> 23:33.463
You can sneak out through
the service elevator.

23:33.464 --> 23:34.631
What about your mom?

23:34.632 --> 23:35.732
I'm not afraid of her.

23:35.733 --> 23:37.266
And anyway,
if you get that job,

23:37.267 --> 23:39.435
She'll brag to everybody
that her son takes lessons

23:39.436 --> 23:41.605
from an oboist
at the new york symphony.

23:41.606 --> 23:44.874
Get out of here.

23:44.875 --> 23:46.643
Bye.

24:09.299 --> 24:12.537
What do you think?

24:17.474 --> 24:19.809
I-i...
-Perfect, right?

24:19.810 --> 24:22.145
Yes.

24:22.146 --> 24:24.113
Next!

24:24.114 --> 24:25.715
<i>Grazie.</i>

24:53.443 --> 24:55.478
Write this down.

24:55.479 --> 24:59.315
I want a turkey sandwich

24:59.316 --> 25:02.218
With no mayonnaise.

25:02.219 --> 25:03.920
What does it say?

25:03.921 --> 25:07.023
Turkey sandwich
with no mayonnaise.

25:07.024 --> 25:08.858
Okay.

25:34.819 --> 25:39.122
Thank you.
Next.

25:39.123 --> 25:41.625
It's over, sir.

26:17.027 --> 26:19.764
Fuck.
