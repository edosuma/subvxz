Cheers <i>is filmed</i>           
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i>

00:03.869 --> 00:05.753
Sounds great, Kelly.      
     I'll see you Saturday.

00:05.787 --> 00:07.755
Yeah. Okay.

00:07.789 --> 00:09.257
Guess what, guys?       
What?

00:09.291 --> 00:11.893
I'm going to my first      
      country club dance.

00:11.927 --> 00:13.061
SAM:                            
Whoo-hoo!                       
                All right.

00:13.095 --> 00:15.430
Yeah, I gotta check       
    the bus schedule.

00:15.464 --> 00:16.731
Wait, wait, Woody--       
     you're going out with

00:16.765 --> 00:18.733
the boss's daughter and you're 
    riding around on a bus?

00:18.767 --> 00:20.685
Yeah, it's getting to be    
    a real drag, too.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.787
Especially when         
    you can't sit together.

00:25.390 --> 00:26.941
Maybe I can borrow Sam's car.

00:26.975 --> 00:27.942
CLIFF:             
        Whoa, whoa, hey.

00:27.976 --> 00:29.177
Hold up there, Woodster.

00:29.212 --> 00:31.979
Lest you forget the
             Ten Commandments   
             of Sam Malone.

00:32.014 --> 00:33.331
Hence, commandment              
number three:

00:33.365 --> 00:35.032
"Thou shall not
                 loan thy car."

00:35.067 --> 00:36.968
I thought that was              
commandment number four.

00:37.002 --> 00:38.202
That's              
            "Honor thy hair."

00:39.705 --> 00:42.073
I think Sam might make     
          an exception

00:42.107 --> 00:43.858
in my case.
                     Hey, Sam?

00:44.927 --> 00:46.711
Sam?

00:46.745 --> 00:47.695
Can I borrow your car?

00:47.729 --> 00:49.347
My car?

00:49.382 --> 00:50.815
Yeah, I'll be real              
careful with it.

00:50.849 --> 00:51.983
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:52.017 --> 00:53.702
No, I'll bring it home early

00:53.736 --> 00:55.704
and I'll wash it                
the next day.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.088
( <i>cackling</i> )

00:57.123 --> 00:58.606
Well, food for thought.

01:01.177 --> 01:03.644
So, Wood, is he gonna   
        loan you the car?

01:03.679 --> 01:06.247
He didn't come right out and  
 say it, but I like my chances.

01:06.282 --> 01:07.915
He's in a great mood today.

01:09.185 --> 01:12.887
( <i>laughing hysterically</i> )

I wish you luck, Woody,

02:23.158 --> 02:24.909
because if Sam does
             lend you that car,

02:24.943 --> 02:25.793
you're home free.

02:25.827 --> 02:28.212
That thing is          
     a rolling aphrodisiac.

02:28.246 --> 02:29.664
Absolutely.           
You know, any female that rides

02:29.698 --> 02:30.865
around with Sam in that car...

02:30.899 --> 02:31.866
Yeah?

02:31.900 --> 02:33.134
...ends up going straight       
        to bed with him.

02:33.168 --> 02:35.403
I've ridden in that car.

02:35.437 --> 02:36.954
Right.

02:39.024 --> 02:41.158
Well, I didn't go           
    to bed with him.

02:41.193 --> 02:43.261
Huh. Right, and they
            always deny it

02:43.296 --> 02:44.962
afterwards,
                     you know?

02:44.997 --> 02:46.664
I hate you guys.

02:46.699 --> 02:50.402
Yeah, then they always cop that 
 anti-male attitude, you know?

02:50.436 --> 02:53.053
Oh, Sammy, mind if I cut out  
          for an hour?

02:53.088 --> 02:55.390
I want to catch                 
the last couple of innings

02:55.424 --> 02:57.124
of my kid Ludlow's              
T-ball game.

02:57.159 --> 02:59.361
Hey, I thought he was the       
  intellectual of the family.

02:59.395 --> 03:00.395
He's into baseball, huh?

03:00.429 --> 03:02.464
Well, he didn't go willingly.

03:02.498 --> 03:03.898
I had to trick him.

03:03.932 --> 03:05.933
I used the old         
     "going to the library

03:05.968 --> 03:07.201
"but running out of gas

03:07.236 --> 03:09.070
in front of the ballpark"       
            routine.

03:09.104 --> 03:11.022
Seems kind of drastic,
          doesn't it?

03:11.056 --> 03:12.390
Come on, Sammy,                 
please.

03:12.424 --> 03:14.258
I don't want                    
the kid growing up

03:14.293 --> 03:15.794
to be a soft,                   
doughy wimp

03:15.828 --> 03:18.329
wearing an argyle sweater       
and smoking a pipe.

03:23.969 --> 03:25.036
SAM:               
             Go ahead, take off.

03:25.071 --> 03:26.871
And don't worry about Lud;      
         he'll be fine.

03:26.906 --> 03:29.307
"Lud: you know,   
              that's Carla's son

03:29.341 --> 03:32.643
by Bennett Ludlow.      
        He's a cute little tyke.

03:32.677 --> 03:34.845
Carla bore a son                
to Bennett Ludlow--

03:34.880 --> 03:37.215
the eminent psychiatrist,       
your mentor?

03:37.249 --> 03:38.682
Oh, this is prime dish.

03:38.717 --> 03:41.786
I can't wait                    
to tell the girls               
in the sleep disorder lab.

03:41.820 --> 03:44.122
So, Carla, tell, tell.

03:44.156 --> 03:46.257
Have you bedded                 
any other Rhodes scholars?

03:47.393 --> 03:51.263
Uh... no.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.965
But one egghead, long-distance, 
        phone-in father

03:53.999 --> 03:55.900
is enough for          
    this baby factory.

03:55.934 --> 03:57.802
In spite of the fact      
     that Dr. Ludlow's work

03:57.836 --> 03:59.203
takes him out          
        of the country,

03:59.238 --> 04:02.690
I'm sure he's          
      a marvelous parent.

04:02.725 --> 04:05.827
No, a good parent           
    is someone who's there.

04:05.861 --> 04:07.528
Who's there to help them out  
      with their homework.

04:07.563 --> 04:10.398
There when they wake up     
in the middle of the night

04:10.432 --> 04:11.699
crying their eyes out.

04:11.734 --> 04:13.634
He's there with         
     the bottle of Bactine

04:13.669 --> 04:15.603
when they give themselves       
         a bad tattoo.

04:17.456 --> 04:18.790
Well, I've been there.

04:18.824 --> 04:21.426
I raised eight kids       
    on a waitress's salary,

04:21.459 --> 04:23.594
and I want you to know     
     they're all good kids,

04:23.629 --> 04:25.029
and not one of them             
has had a conviction

04:25.063 --> 04:27.565
that stood up on appeal.

04:29.502 --> 04:31.169
I stand corrected, Carla.

04:32.738 --> 04:33.904
Mom, how could you

04:33.939 --> 04:35.823
do that to me?

04:35.858 --> 04:37.291
Luddy, how did you          
        get here?

04:37.325 --> 04:38.726
Did the coach drop you off?

04:38.761 --> 04:39.577
Yes.

04:39.611 --> 04:41.579
Oh, then the game               
ended early.

04:41.614 --> 04:42.580
So how'd you do?

04:42.615 --> 04:45.834
Coach me had on the bench       
         all afternoon.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.135
Well, what do you mean?

04:47.169 --> 04:48.502
You didn't play at all?

04:48.537 --> 04:50.221
Well, they finally put me in

04:50.256 --> 04:51.989
after the kid          
    with the cast on his leg

04:52.024 --> 04:54.526
and the two fat girls left.

04:56.362 --> 04:57.495
So what did you do?

04:57.530 --> 05:01.399
I hit the ball,         
 but they <i>still</i> made fun of me.

05:01.433 --> 05:04.735
Like everybody's just supposed 
to <i>know</i> which way to run.

05:06.905 --> 05:09.156
I'm going to go clean up        
your specs.

05:10.659 --> 05:12.093
Carla's got herself a real      
Poindexter there, huh?

05:12.128 --> 05:13.178
Yeah.

05:13.212 --> 05:14.179
It's sad to say

05:14.213 --> 05:15.946
that kids not accepted          
by their peers

05:15.981 --> 05:17.882
really never learn how          
to get along with people

05:17.916 --> 05:19.016
in the big grown-up world.

05:19.051 --> 05:20.485
Why is that, Cliff?

05:20.519 --> 05:23.655
'Cause they keep    
            boring everyone and 
            driving them crazy

05:23.689 --> 05:26.791
with long speeches      
        filled with meaningless 
        statistics?

05:26.825 --> 05:27.792
Yep, yeah.

05:27.826 --> 05:32.163
63% of them live lives          
of quiet desperation.

05:32.198 --> 05:34.399
And how about those     
        who sit next to them?

05:36.068 --> 05:39.036
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane,     
a friend of your father's.

05:39.071 --> 05:40.037
I understand

05:40.072 --> 05:42.039
you had a rough 
                afternoon.

05:42.074 --> 05:44.442
You must never let the bullies 
         of this world

05:44.476 --> 05:45.910
diminish your inner spirit

05:45.944 --> 05:47.878
nor put out the fire      
  of your competitive nature.

05:47.913 --> 05:49.046
Sir?                    
                    Yes, son?

05:49.081 --> 05:51.549
You're kneeling         
          on some gum.

05:53.485 --> 05:55.286
Heavens,            
            my new gabardines!

05:55.321 --> 05:56.287
You and gum.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.223
He attracts it  
                like a magnet.

06:00.092 --> 06:01.125
We'll swing by our place

06:01.159 --> 06:02.793
and pick up another pair
        on our way to the opera.

06:02.828 --> 06:04.995
Which opera are you going to?

06:05.030 --> 06:07.915
<i>Die Meistersinger.</i>

06:07.950 --> 06:09.483
Oh, I know that one.

06:09.518 --> 06:10.985
That's where all        
    the master singers

06:11.020 --> 06:14.022
get together in Nuremberg       
     and have a big contest

06:14.056 --> 06:15.790
to find out who's best.

06:15.824 --> 06:18.876
Oh, yeah, kind of           
    like <i>Star Search.</i>

06:18.911 --> 06:22.379
Basically.

06:22.414 --> 06:24.015
Frasier...

06:25.451 --> 06:28.420
Frasier, I just had             
a delicious idea.

06:28.454 --> 06:29.621
Why don't we buy                
an extra ticket

06:29.655 --> 06:31.723
and take young Lud              
to the opera with us?

06:31.757 --> 06:33.057
LUD:                            
Oh, wow, great!

06:33.091 --> 06:36.327
But I have to ask my mom.

06:36.361 --> 06:38.196
Mommy, Dr. Crane and his wife

06:38.230 --> 06:40.798
invited me to go        
    to the opera with them.

06:40.832 --> 06:42.316
Well, you don't     
            have to be polite.

06:42.350 --> 06:44.018
Just tell them to bug off.

06:46.622 --> 06:49.524
But, Mom, I <i>want</i> to go.     
            Please?

06:49.558 --> 06:51.425
Carla, may I have a word        
with you?

06:51.460 --> 06:54.228
Yeah. Sammy,        
            entertain the kid.

06:55.930 --> 06:57.999
Carla, you'd be doing   
        us all a favor.

06:58.033 --> 07:00.401
Allowing Frasier and me 
        to spend some time

07:00.435 --> 07:03.337
with your son might help us 
    to formulate a decision

07:03.371 --> 07:06.073
that's been under much  
        discussion as of late.

07:06.107 --> 07:08.809
You see, the two of us are  
    considering whether or not

07:08.844 --> 07:10.678
we wish to reproduce.

07:12.848 --> 07:15.232
You're thinking                 
of having a baby, huh?

07:16.602 --> 07:18.335
So, tell me,                    
how long does it take

07:18.369 --> 07:20.337
one of your pods                
to hatch, anyway?

07:22.340 --> 07:25.810
Listen, you want                
to baby-sit Lud,                
be my guest.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.411
What's that                     
on your shirt?

07:27.446 --> 07:28.980
Huh? Ooh!

07:30.415 --> 07:33.150
You're good.
                    You're good.

07:33.185 --> 07:35.520
Okay, Luddy,                    
you're going to the opera.

07:35.554 --> 07:37.054
Yay!

07:37.088 --> 07:38.372
Yeah, you're going              
to love it, kid, too.

07:38.407 --> 07:39.440
You know that Wagner,

07:39.474 --> 07:41.475
he wrote all those pieces       
when he was stone deaf.

07:41.510 --> 07:42.760
No, that was Beethoven.

07:42.795 --> 07:43.594
I meant blind.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.079
That was Milton.

07:45.114 --> 07:46.263
He had warts.

07:46.297 --> 07:47.632
That was you.

07:49.001 --> 07:51.135
I told you                      
not to tell anybody.

07:56.307 --> 07:57.775
Shouldn't they be back          
by now?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.011
How long can an opera last?

08:00.045 --> 08:01.362
Well, the last one              
I remember

08:01.397 --> 08:02.930
lasted about eight months.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.702
Yeah, I just hope           
    everything's all right.

08:07.736 --> 08:12.156
Carla, look, I know 
            you love your kids  
            and everything...

08:12.190 --> 08:15.092
I mean, like your kids.

08:15.126 --> 08:18.396
I mean, I know  
                you have kids...

08:18.430 --> 08:20.698
but I have never seen you   
    this concerned before.

08:20.733 --> 08:21.649
Well, Lud's special.

08:21.683 --> 08:22.800
Yeah?

08:22.835 --> 08:23.801
Yeah.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.237
I mean, whenever I come home  
        at night,

08:26.271 --> 08:28.973
he always brings me a pan       
of hot water for my feet.

08:29.007 --> 08:31.542
He actually asks me       
        how my day went.

08:31.577 --> 08:34.429
I don't know                    
if I ever told                  
anybody this before...

08:34.462 --> 08:35.429
I love him.

08:35.464 --> 08:38.131
You don't have to be
            shy about saying

08:38.166 --> 08:40.100
that you love   
                your kids.

08:40.135 --> 08:42.653
Oh, why don't you just take out 
an ad in the Yellow Pages?

08:44.356 --> 08:46.390
( <i>Rebecca whistling</i> )

08:46.425 --> 08:48.693
Hey, Normie, I almost forgot

08:48.727 --> 08:50.528
how much Sam's Corvette girls  
        love to whistle.

08:50.563 --> 08:52.329
( <i>groans</i> )

08:52.364 --> 08:54.765
I wish I had a nickel   
        for every time

08:54.799 --> 08:56.667
I heard that sound, huh?

08:56.701 --> 08:59.469
Classic slamming of the door.

08:59.504 --> 09:02.323
( <i>laughing</i>      
                 <i>hysterically</i> )

09:05.027 --> 09:07.828
So Sam still    
                won't loan you  
                his car, huh?

09:07.863 --> 09:11.732
No, but I'm starting      
to love that man's laugh.

09:11.767 --> 09:14.151
Sammy, come on,
                 give the kid a 
                 break, will ya?

09:14.186 --> 09:16.020
Just let him    
                borrow your car.

09:16.054 --> 09:16.670
Please, Sam?

09:16.705 --> 09:18.188
Kelly's the best girl      
        I've ever dated,

09:18.223 --> 09:20.124
and she loves Corvettes.

09:20.158 --> 09:21.308
Well, I tell you what, Woody.

09:21.343 --> 09:22.877
I'll give her a lift in my car.

09:22.911 --> 09:23.928
No way, Sammy.

09:23.962 --> 09:25.496
Every girl who goes             
for a ride in your Corvette

09:25.530 --> 09:26.563
winds up going                  
to bed with you.

09:26.598 --> 09:27.698
Right, Miss Howe?

09:27.732 --> 09:29.333
( <i>shrieks</i> )

09:31.536 --> 09:35.123
Well, now she's         
        just being redundant.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.458
It's okay, Sam, I understand  
      about the car thing.

09:37.492 --> 09:38.393
Oh, good.

09:38.427 --> 09:41.212
I didn't mean to put
            you on the spot.

09:41.246 --> 09:43.914
And, uh, I want you to know 
    that, even though you won't

09:43.949 --> 09:45.883
let me borrow your car,     
    there's no hard feelings.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.584
And if I ever have  
            a car of my own,

09:47.619 --> 09:49.519
and you want    
                to borrow it,   
                it's yours.

09:49.554 --> 09:51.039
Ah, I know what                 
you're trying to do.

09:51.073 --> 09:53.441
You're trying to guilt me       
into giving you my car.

09:53.475 --> 09:55.743
No, I'm not.        
            I wouldn't do that.

09:55.777 --> 09:57.211
You're my best friend.

09:57.246 --> 10:00.564
Ah, man, you're scum!

10:00.598 --> 10:03.100
I mean it, Sam, 
                I love you.

10:03.135 --> 10:05.535
Hey, fine.                      
Here, take the damn car.

10:05.570 --> 10:07.537
What just happened?

10:07.572 --> 10:09.606
You outsmarted him.

10:09.641 --> 10:12.376
So that's what it feels like.

10:13.611 --> 10:17.248
Mom, Mom!               
    The opera was so great!

10:17.282 --> 10:20.017
All the singing,                
and costumes.

10:20.051 --> 10:22.403
This was the best           
        day of my life!

10:22.437 --> 10:24.405
That's          
                terrific, Lud.

10:24.439 --> 10:25.907
I never seen him
                so excited.

10:25.941 --> 10:26.908
Thanks, guys.

10:26.942 --> 10:29.109
Oh, Carla, it was our pleasure.

10:29.144 --> 10:30.645
He's an extraordinary child.

10:30.679 --> 10:32.980
Yes, we had             
        an extensive discussion

10:33.015 --> 10:34.849
on the way back 
                about opera,

10:34.883 --> 10:36.634
the arts, film...

10:36.668 --> 10:39.971
Oh, Carla, may we take Lud      
to the movies tonight?

10:40.005 --> 10:43.374
There's a revival       
        of <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i>        
        <i>we'd love him to see,</i>

10:43.408 --> 10:44.859
and then we were thinking       
he could sleep over,

10:44.893 --> 10:46.994
We could have brunch and a      
matinee of <i>Peter and the Wolf.</i>

10:47.029 --> 10:50.131
Gee, I don't know.

10:50.165 --> 10:51.365
He's never stayed           
     away from home before.

10:51.399 --> 10:52.466
He's only six.

10:52.500 --> 10:56.938
Please, Mommy?                  
Please?

10:56.972 --> 11:00.507
Oh, heck, you really want       
      to go that bad, huh?

11:00.542 --> 11:02.776
Go, go, go ahead.               
Have a good time.

11:02.811 --> 11:03.844
Stay as long as you want.

11:03.878 --> 11:05.045
I'll see you when you get back.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.046
Thank you, Carla.

11:06.081 --> 11:08.048
We'll take good care of him,    
don't worry.

11:11.853 --> 11:12.953
Well, that's that.

11:14.422 --> 11:15.806
I lost my baby.

11:23.331 --> 11:24.432
Listen, Sam,    
                I hope it's okay

11:24.466 --> 11:25.566
that I keep     
                asking you this,

11:25.600 --> 11:27.200
but I just want 
                to make sure    
                one last time

11:27.235 --> 11:28.536
that you haven't    
            changed your mind

11:28.570 --> 11:29.637
about me        
                using your car.

11:29.671 --> 11:30.755
No, Woody.

11:30.789 --> 11:32.240
No, you haven't     
            changed your mind

11:32.274 --> 11:33.540
or no, I can't  
                use your car

11:33.575 --> 11:34.909
or no, it's not 
                okay to ask?

11:34.943 --> 11:38.846
No, get out of my face          
before I hurt ya.

11:38.881 --> 11:41.082
He's special.

11:44.552 --> 11:47.889
Hey, Carla, still listening   
      to that opera stuff?

11:49.057 --> 11:50.357
She can't       
                hear you, Cliff.

11:50.392 --> 11:52.126
She's got the music 
            blasting in her ear.

11:52.161 --> 11:53.661
You mean she                    
can't hear me

11:53.695 --> 11:55.329
if I say                        
she reminds me of

11:55.363 --> 11:57.965
one of those little             
plastic troll dolls?

12:00.836 --> 12:02.302
Hey, what's...         
      what's the big idea?

12:02.337 --> 12:03.871
I thought               
     you couldn't hear me.

12:03.905 --> 12:05.556
No, but I can see,  
            and you're ugly.

12:09.628 --> 12:12.763
So, are you still cramming all  
that high-Q stuff in your head?

12:12.797 --> 12:15.566
You know, Sammy, I      
        don't have any choice.

12:15.601 --> 12:18.669
I mean, ever since      
        Dr. Cyclops and Morticia

12:18.704 --> 12:22.139
started introducing 
            Lud to all this     
            culture crap,

12:22.173 --> 12:23.974
it's like I don't   
            have anything to    
            talk to him about.

12:24.008 --> 12:26.026
So I'm listening    
            to all this music,

12:26.060 --> 12:28.829
and I'm plowing through 
        all these books here.

12:28.864 --> 12:30.330
Look at this.

12:30.365 --> 12:31.999
Good heavens, man.

12:32.033 --> 12:33.868
<i>History of Modern Art.</i>

12:35.704 --> 12:39.406
<i>Comprehensive Guide</i>            
 <i>to the World Of Opera.</i>

12:39.440 --> 12:41.274
<i>Hollywood Wives.</i>

12:41.309 --> 12:43.694
Yeah, I'm getting       
        into literature, too.

12:45.030 --> 12:46.697
I've read this.

12:49.567 --> 12:53.020
Oh, man, who am 
                I trying to kid?

12:53.054 --> 12:54.922
I'm just stupid.

12:54.956 --> 12:55.990
Hey, you are not stupid.

12:56.024 --> 12:59.493
Oh, how would you know? 
        You're stupid.

12:59.528 --> 13:02.462
If you were really stupid,      
you wouldn't know that about me.

13:02.497 --> 13:04.798
Good point.

13:04.833 --> 13:06.299
Greetings, Carla.

13:06.334 --> 13:08.235
We just dropped     
            your son off at home

13:08.269 --> 13:09.620
after a lovely sojourn

13:09.654 --> 13:11.321
at the Museum   
                of Fine Art.

13:11.356 --> 13:13.891
You know, that child
            is such a love.

13:13.925 --> 13:16.277
He's so bright, 
                inquisitive,    
                creative.

13:16.311 --> 13:18.880
He reminds me of    
            myself as a child.

13:18.914 --> 13:20.982
Of course,          
            he has more hair.

13:22.717 --> 13:23.934
We were wondering               
if we could

13:23.968 --> 13:25.536
treat Lud to dinner             
this evening.

13:25.570 --> 13:27.321
Come on, guys.

13:27.355 --> 13:29.757
You've had him out              
every night this week.

13:29.791 --> 13:32.459
Besides, I had a special    
    family evening planned.

13:32.494 --> 13:34.562
I was gonna cook        
      a big bowl of pasta,

13:34.596 --> 13:36.831
and we're all gonna       
      sit around and watch

13:36.865 --> 13:38.332
<i>America's Most Wanted,</i>

13:38.366 --> 13:40.234
and see if we could       
     rat on our neighbors.

13:42.453 --> 13:45.005
Yes, but, you see, Carla,       
     this is special, too.

13:45.039 --> 13:47.675
I mean, I've just managed       
    to finagle reservations

13:47.709 --> 13:49.176
for Magritte's.

13:49.211 --> 13:51.845
It's the most exclusive     
  restaurant in all of Boston.

13:51.879 --> 13:52.996
I never heard of it.

13:53.031 --> 13:53.714
Precisely.

13:56.067 --> 13:57.117
Carla, please.

13:57.151 --> 13:58.886
It would mean a lot       
         to the child,

13:58.920 --> 14:03.223
and I think Lud         
      would enjoy it also.

14:03.258 --> 14:04.508
Oh, all right.  
                Who cares?

14:04.543 --> 14:06.477
More spaghetti for  
            the rest of us.

14:09.314 --> 14:10.881
SAM:        
                    Hey, Fras.

14:10.915 --> 14:14.385
Listen, why don't you invite  
Carla to dinner with you?

14:14.419 --> 14:16.920
Well, now, Sam, uh...

14:16.954 --> 14:20.690
Carla is a fine woman   
        and a good friend.

14:20.725 --> 14:21.691
Actually,       
                she's neither.

14:21.726 --> 14:23.227
And why would I want
            to eat with her?

14:26.080 --> 14:29.099
Frasier, dear, I think          
we should invite Carla.

14:29.134 --> 14:31.635
I think it would                
be very, very nice.

14:32.737 --> 14:36.540
Do you know what    
            would be very,      
            very nice, Lilith?

14:36.574 --> 14:40.144
If you would stop   
            digging your nails  
            into my palm.

14:40.178 --> 14:42.146
But I'm sure I'll choose
        to see your point

14:42.180 --> 14:43.681
before you draw blood.

14:48.854 --> 14:51.989
Carla? Carla, what say     
        we make it four

14:52.023 --> 14:54.592
at Magritte's                   
tonight, huh?

14:54.626 --> 14:55.058
You buying?

14:56.044 --> 14:57.178
I'm going.

14:57.212 --> 14:59.013
Well, good.                     
We're on, then.

14:59.047 --> 15:00.514
We'll call for you at 8:00.

15:00.548 --> 15:03.951
By the way, Carla,  
            please bear in mind

15:03.986 --> 15:05.786
that this is a very

15:05.820 --> 15:07.772
posh establishment.

15:07.806 --> 15:09.306
Need I say more?

15:09.340 --> 15:10.307
Oh, no, no, no.

15:10.341 --> 15:11.709
I get the picture           
        loud and clear.

15:11.743 --> 15:14.578
I'll shave my legs.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.718
I hope this table               
is satisfactory.

15:20.752 --> 15:22.252
Oh, this is wonderful.

15:22.287 --> 15:24.855
You know, the place is just   
     as I had heard it was.

15:24.890 --> 15:27.024
It's delightful.

15:31.195 --> 15:33.280
Everything looks        
     absolutely exquisite.

15:33.314 --> 15:35.950
The menu is           
    a delightful combination

15:35.984 --> 15:39.486
of nouvelle and provincial

15:39.521 --> 15:41.922
with a nod toward           
     domestic ingredients.

15:43.141 --> 15:46.643
And get a load                  
of all this ambiance.

15:46.677 --> 15:48.145
The artwork 
                    is stunning.

15:48.179 --> 15:52.382
Yes, well, there's  
            a delightful example
            of modern art.

15:52.417 --> 15:58.505
If I might venture a guess,     
I would say it's a "Schnaybel."

15:58.539 --> 15:59.673
It isn't.

15:59.707 --> 16:02.676
But, even if it was, it would be
    pronounced "Schnahbel."

16:02.710 --> 16:04.979
Excuse me.              
It's a little hard to tell

16:05.013 --> 16:07.147
this far from our "tahbel."

16:08.816 --> 16:11.585
That's funny, Mom.

16:11.619 --> 16:13.937
Ludlow, please,                 
we're not here to have fun.

16:13.972 --> 16:15.806
We're here                      
to enjoy ourselves.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.441
Now...

16:17.475 --> 16:18.609
would it                        
please everyone

16:18.643 --> 16:20.243
if I ordered                    
for the whole table?

16:20.278 --> 16:21.412
It would        
                be delightful.

16:21.446 --> 16:22.413
Fine. Thank you.

16:22.447 --> 16:23.414
Now, I know that

16:23.448 --> 16:24.948
Lilith's delicate constitution

16:24.982 --> 16:26.350
is not amenable to shallots.

16:26.384 --> 16:28.686
Is there anything else      
    I should be mindful of?

16:28.720 --> 16:31.455
How considerate of you     
        to ask, Frasier.

16:31.489 --> 16:34.191
Actually, I have a delicate   
     constitution, as well.

16:34.225 --> 16:36.427
No extra-heavy barbecue sauce.

16:36.461 --> 16:38.295
I'll be repeating           
    like a Howitzer.

16:44.168 --> 16:46.169
Delightful.

16:49.874 --> 16:52.643
Boy, this sure  
                beats taking the
                bus, doesn't it?

16:52.677 --> 16:56.012
Just you and me,
                the open road.

16:59.517 --> 17:02.285
I'm getting kind    
            of tired of driving.

17:03.455 --> 17:05.255
What do you say     
            we park somewhere

17:05.289 --> 17:07.089
and look at the stars   
        for a while?

17:07.124 --> 17:09.626
Oh, that sounds                 
nice, Woody.

17:10.795 --> 17:13.262
Hey, Sam, where's   
            a good place        
            to go next?

17:13.297 --> 17:15.215
SAM:            
                Make a right    
                at the light!

17:15.218 --> 17:17.617
And not so      
                fast this time!

17:26.327 --> 17:27.461
Thank you.

17:27.494 --> 17:28.929
Oh, and please tell Paul

17:28.964 --> 17:31.732
that the salad course           
was an absolute treasure.

17:31.767 --> 17:33.700
His subtle                      
yet assertive dressing

17:33.735 --> 17:36.103
was the perfect balance         
for the arugula.

17:36.138 --> 17:39.389
I concur in spades.

17:41.442 --> 17:43.627
He'll be pleased
                to hear it.

17:43.661 --> 17:47.447
Well, shall                     
we bouillabaisse?

17:47.482 --> 17:49.567
Ah, now...

17:49.601 --> 17:52.870
smell                           
the piquant bouquet.

17:52.904 --> 17:55.138
Taste it with every             
part of your tongue,

17:55.173 --> 17:57.641
and then let it just            
dance down your throat.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.643
Frasier, as usual,  
            your anticipation

17:59.678 --> 18:01.779
is interfering      
            with my enjoyment.

18:06.417 --> 18:09.186
Yeah, Eddie has         
    that problem, too.

18:14.075 --> 18:16.310
Ludlow, you're not eating.

18:16.344 --> 18:19.012
None for me,          
    thanks, Dr. Crane.

18:20.348 --> 18:22.149
He doesn't like fish.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.185
Look, Carla,                    
this is not something

18:24.219 --> 18:26.086
that comes out                  
of your cupboard

18:26.121 --> 18:28.189
in a tin can                    
with a mermaid on it.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.725
This is <i>fruits de mer.</i>

18:31.759 --> 18:35.930
At $32 a pop, I think           
the lad should give it a try.

18:37.849 --> 18:40.851
Now, Ludlow, you've             
been very open-minded

18:40.885 --> 18:42.553
about everything else.

18:42.587 --> 18:44.287
Make him happy. Take a bite.

18:44.322 --> 18:45.789
If you don't like it,

18:45.824 --> 18:48.191
you can spit it out       
      in your napkin. See?

18:50.361 --> 18:52.696
Carla, we are not here          
to make me happy.

18:52.730 --> 18:55.482
We are here to enrich           
the lad's experience,

18:55.516 --> 18:59.402
which, if I must say so,        
I do believe is my provenance.

18:59.437 --> 19:04.107
Now, Lud, you know we all have  
certain things we don't like.

19:05.143 --> 19:08.078
I detested fish         
      when I was a child,

19:08.113 --> 19:11.949
but I kept eating it and,       
finally, I overcame my aversion.

19:11.983 --> 19:13.200
LILITH:                         
Likewise.

19:13.234 --> 19:14.601
When I first
                    met Frasier,

19:14.635 --> 19:16.303
I detested him.

19:18.472 --> 19:22.642
Yes, but the point              
is you love me now.

19:22.677 --> 19:24.544
And Lud will          
      love bouillabaisse.

19:25.580 --> 19:26.847
Try it.

19:26.881 --> 19:29.599
Okay.

19:33.488 --> 19:35.289
Eww! Fish!

19:35.323 --> 19:36.924
You barely                      
tasted the broth.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.993
Give it a better                
chance than that.

19:39.027 --> 19:41.395
No! I want  
                    a hamburger!

19:41.429 --> 19:45.199
This restaurant does            
not serve hamburgers.

19:46.434 --> 19:48.302
Now, eat                        
your bouillabaisse.

19:48.336 --> 19:50.037
No! This fishy soup stinks!

19:50.071 --> 19:51.989
And I hate it!

19:55.893 --> 19:57.694
What an imp!

19:59.280 --> 20:01.448
Luddy?      
What are you doing?

20:01.482 --> 20:03.417
I'm going to try to get him   
     out from under there.

20:03.451 --> 20:05.519
No, Carla. Carla,               
that's exactly what             
he wants you to do.

20:06.321 --> 20:08.638
One must not play               
the game by his rules.

20:08.672 --> 20:10.740
Now, I've taught                
a seminar or two

20:10.774 --> 20:11.992
on developmental                
behavior,

20:12.026 --> 20:14.527
and the first rule in           
these acting-out situations

20:14.562 --> 20:16.597
is to simply ignore             
the offending child.

20:16.631 --> 20:18.865
Just pretend that               
he doesn't exist.

20:18.900 --> 20:21.485
Eventually, he'll               
get bored and come out.

20:21.519 --> 20:25.121
So... what a lovely meal.

20:27.342 --> 20:29.059
Mmm! Do you know,               
I heard

20:29.093 --> 20:32.362
that the chef here              
was a protégé of...

20:32.397 --> 20:34.931
Do you smell        
            something burning?

20:34.966 --> 20:36.734
Yes. That's my shoe.

20:36.768 --> 20:39.803
I heard that                    
he was a protégé of...

20:39.838 --> 20:42.172
Your shoe   
                    is on fire? 
        Yes.

20:42.206 --> 20:44.040
LILITH:                         
Isn't that painful?

20:44.075 --> 20:45.876
Excruciating.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.748
But I'm not going               
to give the child

20:50.782 --> 20:53.183
the pleasure                    
of hearing me cry out.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.419
So, you see,

20:56.454 --> 20:57.788
it seems                        
he was educated

20:57.822 --> 20:59.857
in a small village              
on the Rhine.

20:59.891 --> 21:01.792
He...

21:01.826 --> 21:04.160
Oh, Lud.

21:04.195 --> 21:08.766
One hotfoot might               
be considered                   
a puckish prank.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.136
But, if you light               
that other match,

21:12.170 --> 21:15.139
it is the end                   
of our tutelage.

21:15.173 --> 21:17.440
Is that                         
perfectly clear?

21:19.010 --> 21:19.760
That's it!

21:19.794 --> 21:21.478
That's it! I've had it!

21:21.512 --> 21:23.480
That severs                     
the relationship!

21:23.514 --> 21:24.981
Frasier,        
                everyone thinks

21:25.015 --> 21:28.151
you're arguing  
                with your clams.

21:37.161 --> 21:40.029
Is there                        
a problem here?

21:40.064 --> 21:41.015
No, no. Of course not.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.883
The boy just slipped
            under the table,

21:42.917 --> 21:45.152
and his mother was      
        about to get him out.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.672
His mother.                     
Uh... yes, yes.

21:48.706 --> 21:50.940
Carla, could you                
take care of this?

21:50.975 --> 21:53.010
Gee, I don't know if I could.

21:53.044 --> 21:56.613
I... I've never taken      
     a psychology seminar.

21:58.016 --> 22:00.784
Sir, we have a very             
nice table in the kitchen.

22:02.653 --> 22:05.455
Please, Carla.                  
Please, please.

22:06.490 --> 22:08.692
Hey, Lud, burger time.

22:08.726 --> 22:10.961
Yay!

22:10.995 --> 22:13.263
Ha-ha!          
                Hotfoot, huh?

22:13.298 --> 22:15.999
My genes must          
     be in there somewhere.

22:18.186 --> 22:19.653
Let's go, Mommy.

22:19.687 --> 22:22.021
First, apologize
                to Dr. Crane.

22:23.374 --> 22:24.541
I'm sorry, Dr. Crane.

22:24.575 --> 22:27.043
I guess I shouldn't       
      have acted this way.

22:27.077 --> 22:29.012
Well, no hard                   
feelings, son.

22:29.047 --> 22:31.314
Let's have dinner               
again sometime

22:31.348 --> 22:34.350
when you're about,              
oh, in your late 30s.

22:34.385 --> 22:35.235
Bye.

22:35.353 --> 22:36.486
Bye.

22:38.689 --> 22:40.157
Uh... I was wondering.

22:40.191 --> 22:41.658
Do you have frog legs?

22:41.692 --> 22:42.659
Why, yes.

22:42.693 --> 22:43.827
They're     
                    nice pants.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.128
No one will 
                    ever notice.

22:45.163 --> 22:46.129
( <i>laughing</i> )

22:46.164 --> 22:47.630
I always wanted 
                to do that.

22:47.665 --> 22:49.733
You're the best mommy           
in the world.

22:49.767 --> 22:51.969
Yeah. Tell me   
                something       
                I don't know.

22:54.572 --> 22:56.473
You know, Lilith,   
            I think we've all

22:56.507 --> 22:58.242
learned something   
            here tonight.

22:58.276 --> 23:00.410
I'm going to try        
     to tell you what it is

23:00.444 --> 23:02.846
before you coat         
 my blistering feet with butter

23:02.881 --> 23:05.015
and drop me off         
     at the emergency room.

23:13.323 --> 23:14.925
You see...

23:14.959 --> 23:17.126
this incident has made something
    very clear to me.

23:17.161 --> 23:21.130
I... I believe my initial       
    instincts were correct.

23:21.165 --> 23:22.866
We shouldn't have children.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.335
I don't think I'd   
            make a good father.
