17:55.658 --> 17:58.911
‐ OR STEAL AN INSANE AMOUNT.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.458
[gunshots]

18:08.129 --> 18:09.672
‐ NOW, SEE WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU KEEP YOUR KNEES BENT?

18:09.755 --> 18:11.424
‐ YEAH. MAKES ME FEEL SOLID
AS A LINEBACKER.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.009
‐ YEAH.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.515
LET'S KEEP WORKING
ON YOUR STANCE.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.522
[gunshots]

18:29.567 --> 18:30.943
‐ THEY LIKE YOU, MY MEN.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.404
‐ THEY'RE DOING WELL.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.823
‐ HOW MUCH MORE TIME
DO THEY NEED?

18:35.906 --> 18:37.116
‐ TWO, THREE MONTHS.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.535
‐ THAT LONG?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.162
‐ IF YOU WANT THEM
TRAINED PROPERLY.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.247
‐ THEY ARE DISCIPLINED.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.959
THEY HIT THE TARGET.
THEY SAY "SIR."

18:47.043 --> 18:48.544
THE OTHER GANGS
THEY'LL BE GOING UP AGAINST

18:48.628 --> 18:50.004
ARE JUST A DUMB BUNCH
OF CATTLE.

18:50.004 --> 18:53.049
‐ DUMB CATTLE.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.092
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

18:55.176 --> 18:58.763
‐ YOU WILL END
THEIR TRAINING SOON.

18:58.846 --> 19:02.350
GO DO YOUR JOB.
‐ YES, SIR.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.987
‐ HOWDY, PARTNER.
‐ HEY, YOU GOT A SECOND?

19:14.987 --> 19:17.406
‐ YEAH.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.033
‐ I WANTED TO PICK YOUR BRAIN
ABOUT SOMETHING.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.576
‐ SHOOT.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.787
‐ I'M NOT REALLY
MOVING UP WITH BELLO.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.330
‐ YOU'RE NOT MOV‐‐
[chuckles]

19:24.413 --> 19:25.706
YOU JUST GOT UNDER, MIKE,

19:25.790 --> 19:26.999
AND YOU'RE ALREADY
TRAINING HIS ARMY.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.876
‐ RIGHT, BUT I'M
NOWHERE NEAR HIM

19:28.959 --> 19:30.419
WHEN HE'S MAKING HIS DEALS.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.130
‐ YEAH. OKAY, WELL,
YOU KNOW, SLOW AND STEADY.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.423
‐ AREN'T YOU
THE ONE WHO SAID,

19:34.507 --> 19:36.008
"NEVER LET A GOOD CRISIS
GO TO WASTE"?

19:36.008 --> 19:37.968
‐ UH, ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT EDDIE HERE?

19:37.968 --> 19:40.554
‐ YEAH, THERE'S A REALLY WEIRD
ENERGY AROUND THERE SINCE THEN.

19:40.638 --> 19:43.641
‐ YEAH. AND BELLO HAD THE BALLS
TO TAKE OUT HIS NUMBER TWO.

19:43.724 --> 19:46.143
YOU KNOW THE REST OF THOSE GUYS
GOTTA BE PRETTY NERVOUS.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.104
‐ I FEEL LIKE HE'S GOTTA BE
WORRIED ABOUT HIS OWN SAFETY.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.855
YOU KNOW, ONE OF
HIS OWN GUYS POPS HIM,

19:49.939 --> 19:51.524
OR ONE OF THESE OTHER CREWS
SENSES WEAKNESS.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.318
‐ YEAH.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.278
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

19:56.362 --> 19:57.571
THINK ABOUT
POSITIONING YOURSELF

19:57.655 --> 19:58.989
TO BECOME
HIS NEW BODYGUARD.

19:59.073 --> 20:00.157
I MEAN, HE ALREADY KNOWS
YOU CAN SHOOT BETTER

20:00.241 --> 20:01.992
THAN THE REST OF HIS GUYS.

20:02.076 --> 20:03.869
‐ OKAY. OKAY.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.621
ANY IDEAS ON HOW
I'D APPROACH HIM WITH THAT?

20:05.705 --> 20:08.708
I MEAN, I COULD SAY THAT
I'M NO LONGER ON ACTIVE DUTY,

20:08.791 --> 20:10.835
AND I CAN BE
HIS 24 HOURS A DAY.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.629
‐ YEAH, THAT'S A START.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.589
SEE, MIKE, THE THING IS
THAT A POSITION LIKE THAT

20:15.673 --> 20:18.718
REQUIRES A VERY, VERY
HIGH LEVEL OF INTIMACY.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.261
I MEAN, YOUR BODYGUARD IS
THE GUY THAT YOU KNOW

20:20.344 --> 20:21.971
WILL COME DRAG YOUR GIRLFRIEND
OUT OF THE HOUSE

20:21.971 --> 20:23.305
WHEN YOUR MISTRESS POPS BY.
‐ MM‐HMM.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.974
‐ DO YOU HAVE THAT LEVEL
OF INTIMACY WITH BELLO?

20:25.057 --> 20:26.434
‐ I DON'T THINK SO.

20:26.517 --> 20:27.977
‐ DO YOU PLAY CARDS
WITH THE GUY?

20:27.977 --> 20:30.646
‐ UH‐UH.

20:30.730 --> 20:34.275
CHECK THIS OUT, THOUGH.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.236
BELLO SAID SOMETHING TODAY.
‐ MM‐HMM.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.988
‐ HE SAID THAT
THE OTHER GANGS WERE LIKE

20:39.071 --> 20:40.573
A DUMB BUNCH OF CATTLE.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.617
IT SOUNDED PRETTY SPECIFIC,
SO I LOOKED IT UP.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.536
IT'S FROM THIS OLD WESTERN,
<i>CITY OF BAD MEN.</i>

20:45.619 --> 20:48.456
‐ AH, OUR NIGERIAN HAS

20:48.539 --> 20:51.125
A GOOD OLD AMERICAN
RAWHIDE FETISH, HUH?

20:51.208 --> 20:52.960
‐ [in a Western drawl]
I'M AIMIN' TO FIND OUT.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.336
‐ SHOOT STRAIGHT, PARTNER.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.096
‐ HALF A MIL, ALL REAL.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.223
THAT'S A HELL OF A SIGHT.
‐ SURE IS.

21:06.307 --> 21:09.018
‐ COMMAND POST'S
A LITTLE FAR FROM HERE, NO?

21:09.018 --> 21:11.312
‐ WELL, YOU KNOW, GIVEN
QUINN'S PENCHANT FOR PARANOIA,

21:11.395 --> 21:13.063
WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT NOT
TAKE ANY CHANCES.

21:13.147 --> 21:15.316
‐ ALL RIGHT, IF THIS GOES
SIDEWAYS, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

21:15.399 --> 21:17.443
‐ SEMI‐AUTOMATIC
UNDER EACH BED,

21:17.526 --> 21:19.361
AND YOURS TRULY WILL BE
30 SECONDS AWAY,

21:19.445 --> 21:21.697
HEARING EVERYTHING.
‐ OKAY.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.949
‐ WHAT CAN I EXPECT
FROM THE TWO OF YOU?

21:24.033 --> 21:24.992
‐ OH, YOU KNOW,
QUINN WANTS TO PARTY.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.077
HE LIKES TO USE
HIS OWN STUFF...SO DO WE.

21:27.161 --> 21:29.038
SO I BROUGHT THE RIGS AND HEMO.
‐ THAT'S COOL. THAT'S COOL.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.540
I MEANT MORE...SEXUALLY.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.709
LOOK, I AIN'T GONNA LIE
TO YOU GUYS.

21:33.793 --> 21:34.960
ME AND PAIGE HEARD YOU
THE OTHER NIGHT.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.962
WE GOT A BET GOING,
AND I GOT A LOT RIDING

21:37.046 --> 21:38.589
ON THE TWO OF YOU
NOT GETTING DOWN.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.466
‐ DO ME A FAVOR.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.009
STAY OUT OF
OUR BUSINESS, JOHNNY.

21:42.092 --> 21:45.054
‐ I'M TALKING A WEEK
OF FREE DRINKS, CHARLIE.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.847
YOU'RE SELFISH.

21:46.931 --> 21:51.101
‐ SO, JOHNNY, YOU BET
THAT WE WOULDN'T HOOK UP?

21:51.185 --> 21:53.020
‐ YEAH. I GOT FAITH
YOU WALK THE WALK.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.980
‐ MM. QUINN'S GOT
THE ROOM NUMBER, RIGHT?

21:54.980 --> 21:56.982
‐ YEAH.
‐ HE SHOULD BE EN ROUTE.

21:57.066 --> 22:00.736
LET'S WALK THAT WALK, JT.
‐ WALK THAT!

22:02.988 --> 22:07.201
‐ WHICH ONE OF THEM
IS THE BEST FROM THE GROUP?

22:07.284 --> 22:09.078
‐ RANDALL'S GOT
THE BEST ATTITUDE.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.664
HE'S A GOOD SHOT,
AND HE BELIEVES IN YOU.

22:11.747 --> 22:12.957
‐ HE DOES?
‐ HE DOES.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.917
ALL THE OTHER GUYS ARE...

22:15.000 --> 22:16.168
A LITTLE NERVOUS
SINCE EDDIE DIED.

22:16.252 --> 22:19.922
BUT I THINK
YOU CAN GET THEM BACK.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.049
I'M SORRY, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT.

22:22.132 --> 22:25.094
‐ NO, YOU'RE SPEAKING
THE TRUTH.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.428
I NEED TO HEAR MORE OF THAT.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.180
‐ HMM.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.099
OTHERS DON'T LOOK
PAST THE END OF THEIR GUNS,

22:30.182 --> 22:32.768
BUT YOU SEE THE HANDWRITING
ON THE WALL.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.773
‐ IT'S AN INTERESTING CHOICE
OF WORDS.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.692
THEY JUST ROLL OFF
YOUR TONGUE LIKE THAT.

22:39.775 --> 22:44.154
‐ NO, IT'S...SOMETHING I CAUGHT
ON TV THE OTHER NIGHT.

22:44.238 --> 22:47.032
KIND OF CLASSIC.
STUCK WITH ME.

22:47.116 --> 22:50.077
‐ <i>CITY OF BAD MEN.</i>
VERY GOOD TITLE, NO?

22:50.160 --> 22:53.038
‐ IT'S VERY ACCURATE.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.040
‐ WHAT DID YOU THINK?

22:55.124 --> 22:57.126
‐ I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.544
I LIKED THE JOHNNY RINGO
CHARACTER,

22:58.627 --> 23:01.589
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
THE STORY DID HIM JUSTICE.

23:04.508 --> 23:07.595
‐ DISMISS THE MEN.
GET IN.

23:07.678 --> 23:10.598
‐ RANDALL.
[whistles]

23:12.016 --> 23:14.435
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

23:14.518 --> 23:16.770
‐ TO FIND JOHNNY RINGO.

23:16.854 --> 23:18.480
‐ HEY, GRAB ME
SOMETHING GOOD.

23:18.564 --> 23:21.859
[cell phone chirps]
IT'S QUINN.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.068
HE'S RUNNING LATE.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.279
‐ RUNNING LATE, HUH?
‐ YEAH.

23:25.362 --> 23:29.742
‐ THEY HAVE RUM.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.119
‐ IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE
A JOHNNY RINGO FILM,

23:32.202 --> 23:35.039
IT HAS TO BE
<i>THE GUNFIGHTER.</i>

23:35.039 --> 23:38.042
THE WESTERN WAS A BIG REASON
WHY I CAME TO AMERICA.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.961
‐ YOU FELL IN LOVE
WITH THE LANDSCAPE?

23:41.045 --> 23:43.756
‐ NO. THE COWBOY.

23:43.839 --> 23:47.968
EVERY CULTURE HAS
ITS ROMANTIC HERO, EH?

23:48.052 --> 23:52.014
JAPAN HAS ITS SAMURAI,
EUROPE HAS THE VIKING,

23:52.097 --> 23:54.016
AND AMERICA HAS THE COWBOY,

23:54.099 --> 23:55.851
BUT HE IS DIFFERENT.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.686
‐ WHY IS THAT?

23:57.770 --> 24:00.022
‐ BECAUSE HE DOESN'T FIGHT
FOR A LORD

24:00.105 --> 24:02.232
OR FOR GOVERNMENT
OR FOR SILVER.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.526
HE FIGHTS FOR HIMSELF.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.112
‐ THAT'S THE AMERICA
OF THE PAST.

24:07.196 --> 24:11.116
‐ NO, MIKE, AMERICA'S
ALWAYS THE SAME.

24:13.494 --> 24:18.332
THIS ONE...
LET'S SEE HOW IT PLAYS.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.250
YOU, BOY, COME.

24:20.334 --> 24:23.462
‐ DID YOU JUST CALL ME "BOY"?

24:23.545 --> 24:24.797
‐ PUT THIS ON THERE.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.048
I WANT TO SEE
THE TELEVISION WORK.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.133
‐ WE DON'T DO THAT.

24:28.217 --> 24:29.969
‐ OH, COME ON, MAN,
WE JUST WANT TO SEE

24:29.969 --> 24:31.053
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
BEFORE WE BUY IT.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.429
‐ IT'S NOT POLICY.

24:32.513 --> 24:35.599
‐ IT'S NOT POLICY
TO HELP THE CUSTOMER?

24:35.683 --> 24:38.185
‐ WE DON'T LET THUGS TELL US
WHAT TO PUT UP ON THE SCREENS.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.779
‐ YOU'RE GONNA SHOW US
THE VIDEO,

24:48.862 --> 24:50.280
AND YOU'RE GONNA APOLOGIZE,
GOT IT?

24:50.364 --> 24:51.907
‐ I'M SORRY.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.993
‐ SAY "THE CUSTOMER'S
ALWAYS RIGHT."

24:54.076 --> 24:56.870
‐ THE CUSTOMER'S
ALWAYS RIGHT.

25:04.878 --> 25:07.923
‐ HOW DID WE END UP
ALL OVER EACH OTHER BACK THEN?

25:08.007 --> 25:10.801
‐ BEFORE WE MET,
YOUR REPUTATION PRECEDED YOU.

25:10.884 --> 25:13.429
YOU WEREN'T A MAN,
YOU WERE A MYTH.

25:13.512 --> 25:17.057
SOMETIMES I THINK
YOU STILL ARE.

25:17.141 --> 25:19.059
‐ WOW.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.352
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I WAS GOING RHETORICAL

25:20.436 --> 25:22.563
WITH THAT QUESTION.

25:22.646 --> 25:23.981
‐ OH.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.900
WELL, WHATEVER.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.486
WE WERE JUST
SOME YOUNG, CRAZY KIDS.

25:29.570 --> 25:31.613
‐ YEAH.
‐ YEAH.

25:31.697 --> 25:36.577
‐ THAT'S BETTER.
BUT WAIT A SECOND.

25:36.660 --> 25:40.080
I MEAN, WAS HOOKING UP
WITH A MYTH REALLY ALL THAT BAD?

25:40.164 --> 25:42.041
[over surveillance radio]
‐ KIND OF.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.209
I MEAN, YOU NEED SOMETHING REAL
IN YOUR LIFE, YOU KNOW?

25:44.293 --> 25:46.962
‐ YEAH, CHARLIE.
[chuckles]

25:47.046 --> 25:51.050
NOTHING KILLS THE MOOD
LIKE A GIRL GETTING SERIOUS.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.801
TEAM ONE, TEAM TWO,
WE GOT INCOMING.

25:59.016 --> 26:01.185
WELCOME TO LA NIEBLA.
YOU GUYS CHECKING IN?

26:01.268 --> 26:02.978
‐ WHERE'S PETE?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.438
‐ OH, HIS KID HAS
THE STOMACH FLU,

26:04.521 --> 26:05.564
SO I'M FILLING IN FOR HIM.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.357
‐ I DON'T KNOW YOU.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.109
‐ YOU KNOW EVERYBODY
THAT PARKS YOUR CAR, SIR?

26:09.193 --> 26:12.321
‐ YEAH, ACTUALLY, I DO.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.032
IF I DON'T, I LEAVE.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.950
BACK IN THE CAR.

26:17.034 --> 26:21.038
‐ SIR, I CAN GRAB
THE MANAGER IF YOU NEED IT.

26:21.038 --> 26:25.000
[engine revs]

26:25.000 --> 26:27.753
YOU GUYS
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.591
LITTLE PARANOID
SON OF A BITCH.

26:34.635 --> 26:37.096
‐ CHUCK FIGURES YOU GOT
A LITTLE EXTRA CONSIDERATION

26:37.179 --> 26:39.098
COMING TO YOU AROUND HERE.
IS THAT RIGHT?

26:39.181 --> 26:40.641
‐ NOPE.
‐ HOW'S THAT MYSTERY GOING?

26:40.724 --> 26:43.185
‐ YOU IMPRESSED ME TODAY.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.979
‐ I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY
HE WAS SPEAKING TO YOU.

26:46.063 --> 26:48.398
‐ I OWE YOU ONE, MIKE.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.275
‐ YOU MEAN THAT?

26:53.695 --> 26:55.989
LET ME PROTECT YOU.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.741
‐ YOU WANT TO BE
MY BODYGUARD?

26:57.825 --> 27:01.620
‐ THAT'S IT.

27:01.703 --> 27:05.165
‐ THIS IS WHAT
YOU ARE ASKING OF ME?

27:08.168 --> 27:11.588
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO ASK
TO BORROW MY MOVIE.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.799
‐ SURE. I MEAN,
YOU CAN THROW THAT IN TOO.

27:13.882 --> 27:18.303
‐ I LIKE YOU, MIKE.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.013
‐ AND HE DON'T MEAN
NO REAL HARM, MR. RINGO.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.348
‐ THAT'S YOU.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.183
‐ THE GUNFIGHTER?
‐ UH‐HUH.

27:23.267 --> 27:26.478
‐ DOES THAT MEAN YES?

27:30.899 --> 27:32.568
‐ YOU SEE THAT?
‐ YES, SIR.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.487
‐ HE DREW FIRST.
YOU SEE IT?

27:35.571 --> 27:37.990
‐ YES.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.576
‐ [chuckles]
"QUINN SPOOKED. MEETING PUSHED.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.202
NO IDEA HOW LONG."

27:42.286 --> 27:45.914
‐ ALL RIGHT,
SO WE'RE IN A HOLDING PATTERN.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.082
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

27:47.165 --> 27:51.336
‐ MAYBE WE SHOULD, UH,
ORDER SOME ROOM SERVICE,

27:51.420 --> 27:52.754
A LITTLE PAY‐PER‐VIEW.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.548
BILL IT TO THE GOOD TAXPAYERS
OF CALIFORNIA.

27:54.631 --> 27:55.799
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
‐ LET'S DO IT.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.010
‐ ALL RIGHT.
[both laugh]

28:01.889 --> 28:03.932
‐ ALL RIGHT, SO I TOLD YOU
WHY I LIKED YOU.
