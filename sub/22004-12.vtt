WEBVTT

00:34.168 --> 00:35.736
Help me.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.706
Please!

00:38.739 --> 00:40.808
Help me!

00:50.884 --> 00:53.621
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:53.654 --> 00:56.257
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

00:56.290 --> 00:58.759
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:58.792 --> 00:59.860
* How, how, how, how

00:59.893 --> 01:02.496
* Hey, hey

01:08.336 --> 01:09.703
* You gotta come on.

01:12.340 --> 01:13.641
All right, Percy, go long.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.509
Boy, ain't no long in here.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.511
You know what I mean.
Run and look over your shoulder.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.512
All right. Come on. Hustle.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.381
Hustle. Hustle. Whoa!

01:20.414 --> 01:21.349
LASALLE:
Oh, come on, Percy.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.283
That was a perfect throw.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.751
He's just trying
to avoid playing our game.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.687
That's right.
Okay. Calling your bluff.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.889
Go for it.
All right.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.858
Truth or dare?
Truth.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.826
When'd you lose your virginity,
high school or college?

01:32.860 --> 01:36.197
Wait, you can't ask me the same
question you just asked her.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.732
Who says? Uh-huh.
Like I said, avoiding.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.771
Oh, let me guess.
Saved by a case?

01:43.804 --> 01:46.174
It is King.
He says he's in Baton Rouge,

01:46.207 --> 01:48.309
and if we don't have anything
going on, we can leave early.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.178
Ooh, don't got to tell me twice.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.812
I love when Pride's
spending time with his daughter.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.514
It means nobody's coming
in here saying...

01:53.547 --> 01:54.782
We got a case.
Exactly.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.151
No, really, we got a case.
I just found out.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.287
A naval civvy
employee was murdered.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.354
Well, how'd you
find out, Sebastian?

02:00.388 --> 02:01.622
We didn't get the call.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.224
Oh, you will.
It's all over social media.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.625
"GameCon Killing."

02:04.658 --> 02:06.294
This is huge.
And these are my peeps.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.128
We got to roll!

02:11.599 --> 02:13.734
I fixed this thing yesterday.
Come on!

02:13.767 --> 02:14.935
Yes.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.237
I'll drive.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.639
Who died and made him King?

02:18.672 --> 02:19.773
Funny.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.442
Anybody know
what GameCon is?

02:21.475 --> 02:22.910
SEBASTIAN:
Are you kidding?

02:22.943 --> 02:24.912
This is, like,
the best convention ever

02:24.945 --> 02:25.846
to come to New Orleans.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.215
You got your Fall Fest,

02:27.248 --> 02:28.649
your Mac N' Cheese Fest,

02:28.682 --> 02:30.651
your Burlesque Fest,
you know, but this...

02:30.684 --> 02:32.553
this is geek fest.
Why the costumes?

02:32.586 --> 02:33.887
SEBASTIAN:
Well, why not?

02:33.921 --> 02:35.656
This is your chance to say,
"This is who I am.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.758
"This is what I like.
I am Lanky Pants.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.261
I'm not ashamed to admit it."
Whoa, Lanky Pants?

02:40.294 --> 02:42.563
It's a high school nickname that
I should not have just shared.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.399
But, uh...
What do we got, Loretta?

02:45.433 --> 02:48.302
Hey, don't mind him, Doc.
Uh, he's amongst his peeps.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.803
Oh.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.706
Anyway, uh,
the victim's Nate Carr.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.911
Multiple stab wounds
to the abdomen, chest and back.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.847
Defensive wounds

02:59.880 --> 03:01.549
indicates he fought
his attacker.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.851
But not here.
Looks like the blood trail

03:03.884 --> 03:05.486
leads in from the door.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.688
NOPD said that
he was attacked upstairs

03:07.721 --> 03:08.789
in his hotel room.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.324
Must have escaped somehow.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.859
Wait, he was staying
at the hotel?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.694
Apparently. Why?

03:13.727 --> 03:15.229
Well, either
that's a coincidence

03:15.263 --> 03:17.431
or PluckyDogXX was right.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.434
Plucky who?
Just, uh, someone who posted
on my message board.

03:20.468 --> 03:21.702
It's a place for
people to post

03:21.735 --> 03:22.836
conspiracy theories,
so you never know

03:22.870 --> 03:24.838
who or what to believe, but...
LASALLE: Wait a second.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.740
You were warned about this
in advance?

03:26.774 --> 03:28.008
I mean, I think so. Maybe.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.577
All he said was that

03:29.610 --> 03:30.978
he had a friend that
was staying here

03:31.011 --> 03:32.946
and that he thought
he was being watched,

03:32.980 --> 03:35.283
but, you know, it sounded like
average, everyday paranoia.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.585
So, wait, this Plucky person
warned you about our victim?

03:37.618 --> 03:38.919
Did he say anything else?

03:38.952 --> 03:40.788
No, just that he was, uh...

03:40.821 --> 03:42.823
needed my help, and he
was hoping I'd come to...

03:42.856 --> 03:44.558
GameCon.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.927
All right.
Hold on.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.430
Is it me, or was that wizard
just staring at us?

03:49.463 --> 03:50.931
Everyone's staring at us.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.267
Now who's paranoid?

03:53.301 --> 03:54.535
Yeah, but the point is...

03:54.568 --> 03:57.538
somebody cried out,
and I missed it.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.939
All right. Lasalle.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.608
You comb through
Carr's hotel room.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.643
Gregorio, you catch up
with NOPD witnesses.

04:02.676 --> 04:03.777
And Percy, you pull surveillance

04:03.811 --> 04:06.414
while I check out that
limited edition Batman poster

04:06.447 --> 04:07.515
just real quick.
No, Sebastian.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.016
No, no, it's fine; it'll be
all right. Learn things.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.352
No, real quick.
I'll be right back.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.720
Are you ki...?

04:13.821 --> 04:16.657
Are we missing Pride yet?

04:20.761 --> 04:23.964
Majority of the blood
was found just inside the door.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.966
Likely the killer
was already inside

04:25.999 --> 04:27.701
when Carr returned to his room.

04:27.735 --> 04:28.936
Think he was lying in wait?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.571
Or he was there
looking for something

04:30.604 --> 04:32.039
and Carr surprised him.

04:32.072 --> 04:35.343
Anything stolen?
Well, it doesn't look like it.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.877
Even his laptop
was still in the room,

04:36.910 --> 04:37.945
although it was
pretty well hidden.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.647
The killer may not have had time

04:39.680 --> 04:41.048
to find it before Carr arrived.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.717
Too many questions,
not enough answers.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.920
We need to figure out why
PluckyDog warned me about Carr.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.422
Come on, people.
We're missing something here.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.425
I'm pushing my luck, aren't I?
No.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.993
Nah.
No, I am. I'm sorry.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.895
I'm still really upset that I
didn't take this more seriously.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.930
You know? Which is why...
Take what more seriously?

04:56.964 --> 04:58.999
Just one second. Which is why
we need to figure out...

04:59.032 --> 05:01.502
that Pride is back now...
SONJA: Yes.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.936
...and I need to shut up.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.406
Hello. Hi.
Welcome back, King.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.675
Yep, and not a moment too soon.
Trust me.

05:07.708 --> 05:08.842
PRIDE:
I don't know about that.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.078
Patton downloaded me
on the case so far.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.080
Sounds like you're
on the right track.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.516
Told you all to take initiative
while I was away.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.750
Sounds like you're doing it.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.619
Continue.
Okay.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.087
Yeah. All right. Well, uh...

05:20.120 --> 05:20.954
Percy, did you
pull surveillance

05:20.988 --> 05:22.523
from the hotel at all?

05:22.556 --> 05:24.425
As a matter of fact, I did.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.460
So, I got Carr

05:26.494 --> 05:30.498
leaving his hotel room
just after being attacked.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.433
Anyone leave after him?
No, the killer must
have ducked out

05:32.466 --> 05:34.535
through the adjoining room,
but you remember that wizard

05:34.568 --> 05:35.969
you said was checking us out?
Yeah.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.606
He entered and exited
Carr's room

05:38.639 --> 05:40.474
about an hour before TOD.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.809
Maybe he's our murderer.

05:41.842 --> 05:42.843
Or it could be Carr's friend,

05:42.876 --> 05:45.012
that PluckyDog guy
trying to get Sebastian's help.

05:45.045 --> 05:45.813
We don't know.
SEBASTIAN: Looks like

05:45.846 --> 05:47.147
he's still trying
to get my help.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.482
He just texted me,
he wants to meet.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.883
Saying he's, uh...

05:49.917 --> 05:51.619
scared for his life,
too, now.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.887
Well, you need to find out who
he is so we can check him out.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.656
Well, I-I mean, I tried earlier
on the message board.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.558
He's not saying.
Could be a trap.

05:57.591 --> 05:58.992
I don't like it.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.628
What do you think,
Sebastian?

06:00.661 --> 06:02.062
Your case, your call.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.031
Well, based on the fact
that he reached out to me

06:04.064 --> 06:06.133
before Carr was murdered,
I think he's legit.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.001
I also think
I have to do everything I can

06:08.035 --> 06:10.037
to make sure
he's not the next victim.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.605
All right. Go.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.474
But take Gregorio
just to be safe.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.142
Okay. Well, uh,
Percy and Lasalle,

06:15.175 --> 06:17.077
you guys head to Belle Chasse
and see if Carr's job

06:17.110 --> 06:18.111
had anything to do with it,
while Pride,

06:18.145 --> 06:19.713
you and Patton do a deep dive,

06:19.747 --> 06:21.549
tear that laptop apart. Come
on, New York. Let's roll.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.817
Now you're pushing your luck.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.091
Oh, no.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.593
Oh, no, what?

06:32.626 --> 06:34.595
What is that?

06:34.628 --> 06:38.065
That is Triple P's worst
nightmare, is what that is.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.500
Damn!

06:39.533 --> 06:41.602
I've been jackaled.

06:41.635 --> 06:42.903
The good news?

06:42.936 --> 06:44.037
Definitely must have
been something

06:44.071 --> 06:46.139
on Carr's laptop
worth killing for.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.508
Bad news?

06:47.541 --> 06:49.510
Whatever it was is long gone.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.078
It some kind of virus?
Yeah.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.613
Sent by The Jackal.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.582
He's not just
my worst nightmare--

06:54.615 --> 06:56.116
he's FBI's, too.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.752
World-class hacker.
No way to stop him,

06:58.786 --> 06:59.987
nobody can find him.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.855
And once he put that digital gun
to your head,

07:01.889 --> 07:03.056
you're screwed.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.191
Well, why didn't he just...

07:04.224 --> 07:06.026
hack into Carr's laptop
at the hotel?

07:06.059 --> 07:07.995
Why try to steal it?

07:08.028 --> 07:10.163
Maybe to make it look
like a break-in

07:10.197 --> 07:12.500
so Carr wouldn't really know
what he was after.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.901
All the more reason

07:13.934 --> 07:16.203
to figure out
what was really on there.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.038
Pride, ain't gonna happen.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.841
I hate to say it,
but I done met my match.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.075
P.
Even your friend Elvis

07:22.109 --> 07:25.713
wouldn't be able
to crack into this laptop.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.581
Although...
What?

07:27.615 --> 07:29.750
This virus was sent remotely.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.951
That mean you can trace it?

07:30.984 --> 07:33.521
If I can...

07:33.554 --> 07:35.689
we might get more
than what he stole.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.726
We might hit
the cyber hacker jackpot.

07:41.762 --> 07:45.132
Pride said to watch our sixes.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.034
Might be more to the case
than we realize.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.201
All the more reason

07:48.235 --> 07:50.270
to make sure nothing
happens to PluckyDog.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.106
You realize you're saying that
like it's a real name, right?

07:53.140 --> 07:56.744
So?
Well, it's not real.

07:56.777 --> 08:00.147
Okay? You ask me, too many
people are walking around here,

08:00.180 --> 08:01.682
thinking they're making
connections when they're not.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.283
It's just not healthy.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.786
Well, I mean, I could argue
the exact opposite, you know?

08:05.819 --> 08:08.188
People like me, admittedly
a little shy, a little geeky.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.991
I mean, we didn't have a way to
connect until we got on...
No. No, no, no.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.826
Computers are not connecting.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.061
Okay, talking's connecting.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.796
Eye contact.
Knowing someone's real name.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.566
That's connecting.
See what I'm saying?
Mm.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.200
Let me ask you a question.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.902
And don't get offended.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.837
When's the last time
you had a date?

08:23.871 --> 08:26.206
What does that have to do
with anything?

08:26.239 --> 08:28.008
It's been a long time, right?
It's been a dry spell.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.643
That's my point. This is
what I'm talking about.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.145
This social media stuff
is crazy. I don't like it.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.847
I don't like it at all.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.683
And what I really don't like
is that I got to walk

08:35.716 --> 08:37.785
into an abandoned building to
save somebody named PluckyDog.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.854
How do you really feel, though?

08:45.759 --> 08:47.728
GREGORIO:
I don't like this.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.697
Yeah, I know. I heard.
No, I don't mean my rant.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.899
This place.
Who would want to meet here?

08:51.932 --> 08:53.567
Someone who's really scared.

08:56.604 --> 08:59.339
"Take the elevator upstairs."

08:59.372 --> 09:00.841
What? No.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.910
There's not even any power.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.778
Wait.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.947
Hold on. Don't move.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.381
Pride?

09:08.415 --> 09:11.251
Pride. Yeah. No, wait.
I can't hear you. Hold on.
PRIDE: Can you hear me?

09:11.284 --> 09:13.253
GREGORIO: Hey. Yeah, Pride,
I can hear you now.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.656
What's up
What about The Ja...?

09:16.824 --> 09:18.325
He's here?

09:18.358 --> 09:20.260
Don't go in there.
It's a trap! Sebastian!
Oh...

09:20.293 --> 09:21.695
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:21.729 --> 09:22.630
Sebastian!

09:41.715 --> 09:43.183
*

09:56.029 --> 09:58.131
Stop.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.667
Identify yourself.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.602
Lanky Pants, it's me.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.372
Adrian?

10:05.405 --> 10:08.141
Adrian Cohen?
Sebastian.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.210
I'm so scared.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.379
That's why I contacted you.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.214
Wait, you're PluckyDog?

10:14.247 --> 10:16.083
Yeah.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.018
It's a long story.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.353
You look good.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.690
Oh. Um...
How have you been?

10:26.894 --> 10:27.961
FBI. Hands up! Now!

10:31.732 --> 10:33.801
You know what, maybe we'll
just catch up a little later.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.081
Wait, you really think

10:48.115 --> 10:48.916
that she's The Jackal?
Are you serious?

10:48.949 --> 10:51.051
FBI's been tracking
IP addresses,

10:51.084 --> 10:52.853
led us right to her.
Sebastian, what's going on?

10:52.886 --> 10:54.054
I don't understand.
You know her?

10:54.087 --> 10:55.956
Yeah, we went to high school
together. Listen, listen, you're

10:55.989 --> 10:57.858
making a huge mistake, okay?
I mean, she reached out to me

10:57.891 --> 11:00.027
for help. Why would she do
that if she's the Jackal?

11:00.060 --> 11:01.995
Look, this isn't
an NCIS case, it's FBI.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.864
You don't like it,
take it up with the SAC.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.699
We-we got to do
something, Tammy.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.001
I can't let this happen.
How well do you know this girl?

11:08.035 --> 11:09.870
Well enough to know that
she's not who they think she is.
All right.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.873
Hold up. Hey, hey, hey,
actually, this is an NCIS case.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.742
You're, uh, suspect,
Adrian, uh...

11:14.775 --> 11:17.811
Cohen, Adrian Cohen.
Ms. Adrian Cohen is our suspect

11:17.845 --> 11:19.179
in the murder
of a naval employee,

11:19.212 --> 11:20.413
and since homicide
takes precedence

11:20.447 --> 11:21.849
over cyber crimes...

11:21.882 --> 11:23.383
Wait, you guys
think that I killed Nate?

11:23.416 --> 11:24.785
No, of course not.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.486
I mean, uh, maybe. Yeah.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.722
It's a possibility. So that's
why we got to take you in

11:28.756 --> 11:30.490
for questioning.
Let's go.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.059
What's going...?

11:35.228 --> 11:36.764
SEBASTIAN:
Thank you.

11:36.797 --> 11:37.831
She better be as innocent
as you say she is,

11:37.865 --> 11:39.032
or we'll be
in a lot of trouble.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.768
ISLER:
You are in a lot of trouble.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.235
Do you know how
long the FBI's

11:42.269 --> 11:43.871
been looking for the Jackal?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.773
You can't just
steal our suspect.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.408
Technically, she was
our suspect first.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.043
But I didn't kill anybody!

11:50.077 --> 11:51.812
Oh, Adrian, don't worry
about it. We got this.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.881
No, you don't got this,
I got this.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.849
Raymond, just hold on.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.117
This isn't just
any small-time hacker.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.886
Do you know
how many government agencies

11:58.919 --> 12:00.453
have been compromised
because of her?

12:00.487 --> 12:02.856
She's not The Jackal, all right?
That's not possible.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.858
And how do you know?
They went to high school
together.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.794
And we were both
on academic decathlon.
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.295
Well, hey, in that case,
never mind.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.263
I mean, what was I thinking?
PRIDE: Sebastian,

12:10.297 --> 12:11.865
take Adrian out
to the courtyard

12:11.899 --> 12:12.966
while we sort this out.
Pride?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.534
Okay, and don't let her

12:14.567 --> 12:15.936
out of your sight, understand?

12:15.969 --> 12:17.771
Okay, I promise.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.807
Come on, let's go.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.444
Raymond, look, it's a
complicated situation.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.946
Mm-hmm.
A lot of moving pieces,

12:25.979 --> 12:27.214
a lot at stake

12:27.247 --> 12:29.449
for both FBI
and NCIS.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.851
Agreed?
Agreed.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.886
And since we all want answers,

12:32.920 --> 12:35.155
I suggest that
we work together.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.857
A joint investigation?

12:36.890 --> 12:39.092
Yes, and see where it all leads.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.862
I swear to you, Sebastian,

12:41.895 --> 12:43.163
I don't know what's going on.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.032
I don't understand
why any of this is happening.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.334
Okay, okay, I-I know,
I believe you.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.535
Do you, really?

12:48.568 --> 12:49.870
Well, yeah.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.571
I just...

12:51.604 --> 12:53.941
How did you know that something
was gonna happen to Carr

12:53.974 --> 12:56.109
before it even did, and-and why
all the secrecy, you know?

12:56.143 --> 12:57.444
Why the PluckyDog stuff?

12:57.477 --> 12:59.913
Just-just pick up the phone
and call me.

12:59.947 --> 13:03.016
I... I wasn't sure you'd answer.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.319
ISLER:
Ms. Cohen?

13:06.353 --> 13:08.321
It's okay.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.823
Okay.
Just-just tell 'em
what you know.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.859
Okay.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.475
What?

13:28.508 --> 13:31.344
Sure you haven't seen her
since high school?

13:31.378 --> 13:33.847
Yeah, why?
Nothing. Relax.

13:33.881 --> 13:36.149
I'm just... picking up
on a little vibe, you know?

13:36.183 --> 13:37.450
Connection.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.551
Can you not, right now?

13:39.987 --> 13:41.955
All right, let's go watch.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.023
Man.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.992
ISLER:
These are all illegal hacks,

13:45.025 --> 13:46.526
each perpetrated by The Jackal.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.528
And each digitally tracked

13:48.561 --> 13:50.297
by the FBI's
cyber crimes division

13:50.330 --> 13:52.599
to your computer,
Ms. Cohen.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.002
I'm telling you, I don't know
anything about these.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.937
I barely even use
my home computer.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.338
I use my cell.
Which is how

13:58.371 --> 13:59.639
we tracked
you down today,

13:59.672 --> 14:01.241
tracing your computer's IP

14:01.274 --> 14:02.642
directly to your cell.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.444
A cell which initiated

14:04.477 --> 14:06.413
several
high-profile hacks

14:06.446 --> 14:10.918
and stole top secret software
and held them for ransom.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.921
Which is exactly
what Nate was worried about.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.056
We were working on a gaming app
and he was convinced

14:16.089 --> 14:17.457
that someone was trying
to steal it.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.192
At first I just,
I-I don't know,

14:19.226 --> 14:21.628
I thought he was
being paranoid, and...
PRIDE: But you must have

14:21.661 --> 14:23.396
thought something wasn't right,

14:23.430 --> 14:26.099
otherwise why reach out
to Sebastian for help?

14:26.133 --> 14:29.436
I wasn't sure. I thought
that he could check it out.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.072
But I didn't want him to think
that I was paranoid, too,

14:32.105 --> 14:34.607
so I-I didn't want him
to know who was asking.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.110
What were you doing
in Nate's hotel room

14:37.144 --> 14:38.912
just before he was murdered?

14:38.946 --> 14:42.049
I was worried about him.
We're partners.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.117
I still hadn't heard back
from Sebastian,

14:44.151 --> 14:46.219
and I wanted to make sure
that he was okay.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.121
And then when
Nate was killed...

14:48.155 --> 14:49.923
I'm telling you,
somebody's setting me up.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.559
Someone is trying to make me
look like your Jackal.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.995
If so, they're doing
a masterful job at it.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.033
See here?

15:00.067 --> 15:02.970
That's $3 million transferred
to an offshore account

15:03.003 --> 15:06.006
in your name, from
your IP address.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.341
What?
Can you explain to me
where that came from?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.243
ADRIAN: I-I don't know.
You know what, this is...

15:10.277 --> 15:12.645
this is crazy, all right?
This doesn't make any sense.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.414
She-she's got to be
getting set up.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.683
Or maybe not.
Don't bite my head off.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.085
I'm just saying you
haven't seen her in years.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.586
You know, people change.
It could be that...

15:19.619 --> 15:21.088
She's not The Jackal, Tammy.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.090
All right? And she's
no killer either.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.724
Adrian couldn't dissect
a frog in the tenth grade.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.792
You're telling me
she stabbed somebody?

15:25.825 --> 15:28.728
I'm not sure that argument'll
hold up in court.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.363
All right, let's just say
you're right,

15:30.397 --> 15:32.365
let's say she's not responsible
for any of this--

15:32.399 --> 15:35.068
why would somebody go through
all this trouble to set her up?

15:35.102 --> 15:37.337
I don't know.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.739
But I do know she's
counting on me to figure it out.

15:39.772 --> 15:43.076
PRIDE:
Raymond, let's talk.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.012
You may not have
much of a case, but I do.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.014
I'm taking her in.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.416
Yeah, I'm not sure she's guilty
of either yet, Raymond.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.185
She comes across as more victim
than criminal on both cases.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.187
The facts say otherwise.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.755
You haven't proven
anything yet.
I don't need proof,

15:55.788 --> 15:58.191
I just need probable cause,
and I have that in spades.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.260
You... Anything more
on the virus?

16:00.293 --> 16:03.263
I traced it back to the location
where you found Adrian.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.098
Trail stops there.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.000
That's not possible.
You keep saying that.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.768
PATTON: I'll tell you
what also isn't possible:

16:08.801 --> 16:10.270
how The Jackal

16:10.303 --> 16:12.139
was able to get through
my firewalls

16:12.172 --> 16:13.540
to even get to Carr's laptop.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.675
After we got infiltrated
last year, I turned this place

16:15.708 --> 16:18.178
into a digital fortress.
But if The Jackal's that good,

16:18.211 --> 16:19.779
why were you able
to trace it at all?

16:19.812 --> 16:22.349
Exactly. It doesn't make sense.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.684
Unless Adrian's being set up
and he wanted the trail

16:24.717 --> 16:26.153
to lead to her.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.621
Listen, just give us
till the morning, all right?

16:28.655 --> 16:31.124
Let us see if we can figure out
what's really going on.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.061
It won't do you any good if you
bring her in and you're wrong,

16:34.094 --> 16:36.496
and The Jackal's
still out there.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.231
All right.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.067
But if you can't prove
that she's being set up

16:40.100 --> 16:43.036
or that she's the murderer,
she's mine.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.738
Thanks, Pride.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.207
Don't thank me yet.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.076
Banking a lot
on you trusting your friend.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.378
But you better find proof
to exonerate her

16:51.411 --> 16:53.646
and fast, otherwise
there's nothing I can do.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.647
Yeah. Let's go.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.216
Call Chris and Sonja.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.550
They're on their way
to Loretta's.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.786
Fill 'em in.
Jackal or not,

16:59.819 --> 17:01.454
our job is to find out
who killed Carr.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.022
Copy that.

17:03.056 --> 17:06.626
GREGORIO: How 'bout the base?
Anything there?
No, no, nothing Carr was doing

17:06.659 --> 17:08.061
at Belle Chasse
raised any flags.

17:08.095 --> 17:10.430
Look, we're walking
into autopsy now,

17:10.463 --> 17:12.632
we will let you know
what we find.
GREGORIO: All right.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.068
Not sure what we're gonna find
is gonna help Sebastian's friend

17:15.102 --> 17:17.604
either way. Sounds like she's
in a whole heap of trouble.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.672
Yeah, makes you wonder
why she reached out for help

17:19.706 --> 17:22.409
from Sebastian
after all these years.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.245
First love, maybe
high school sweetheart?

17:25.278 --> 17:27.080
Mmm... I'm thinking Sebastian

17:27.114 --> 17:29.616
was more into robotics
in high school than girls.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.351
Miss Loretta.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.486
Was just coming to see you.
Did you find anything

17:33.520 --> 17:35.122
to help us figure out
who killed Carr?

17:35.155 --> 17:38.458
I was just about to call Dwayne.
I found skin samples

17:38.491 --> 17:39.792
under the victim's fingernails.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.128
Looked like he put up
quite a fight.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.495
Any chance
it matched somebody

17:42.529 --> 17:44.131
named Adrian Cohen?

17:44.164 --> 17:46.633
No. They matched an ex-con.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.868
Somebody by the name
of Martin Farrel.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.104
Why?
Is that a problem?

17:51.138 --> 17:53.206
ISLER:
Time's up.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.208
A deal's a deal.
She's FBI's now.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.244
Sebastian?
Pride?

17:57.277 --> 17:59.212
Sorry, Sebastian,
she's not a suspect anymore,

17:59.246 --> 18:00.247
we can't hold her.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.381
Okay, okay, all right,
h-hold on.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.283
So, what if the two
cases are connected?

18:03.316 --> 18:05.218
What're you talking about?

18:05.252 --> 18:07.420
Well, whatever The Jackal wanted
was on Carr's laptop, right?

18:07.454 --> 18:09.289
That's why he erased it.
That's why she erased it.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.258
Why would I erase something

18:11.291 --> 18:13.460
that I helped him create--
or steal it? We were partners.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.428
You wouldn't be the first person
to kill their partner.

18:15.462 --> 18:18.131
Except she's not the killer,
Martin Farrel is.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.468
Yeah, which means chances are
that Farrel killed Carr

18:21.501 --> 18:23.170
so that the real
Jackal could

18:23.203 --> 18:24.604
get whatever was on
that laptop, right.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.239
But The Jackal...
he didn't want anyone to know

18:26.273 --> 18:27.174
that it was actually a hack,

18:27.207 --> 18:30.210
so he had to hire muscle
to try to steal it.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.811
But when Carr tried
to stop Farrel,

18:31.844 --> 18:34.681
Farrel had no choice
but to kill him.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.485
Okay, is anybody
following this?

18:38.518 --> 18:40.487
I think the point is,

18:40.520 --> 18:44.157
The Jackal and the
murder are connected,

18:44.191 --> 18:45.758
which would still
make this

18:45.792 --> 18:46.693
a joint investigation.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.329
All right, this is not
a turf war, Raymond,

18:49.362 --> 18:50.897
We're all just
after the same thing.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.465
No, no, no, I'm after the truth,
he's just trying

18:52.499 --> 18:54.201
to protect his old girlfriend
from high school.

18:54.234 --> 18:57.770
She barely even noticed me.
He barely even noticed me.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.341
Still, I can't deny that

19:01.374 --> 19:02.575
there's some merit
to what you're saying.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.577
Agreed.
To that end,

19:04.611 --> 19:06.246
what if Sebastian

19:06.279 --> 19:07.580
goes with your agents,

19:07.614 --> 19:09.316
try and help them
figure out

19:09.349 --> 19:11.551
why somebody is
setting up Adrian--

19:11.584 --> 19:13.320
if she's being set up--

19:13.353 --> 19:15.322
while you stay here

19:15.355 --> 19:16.589
and help with all
the cyber tracking.

19:16.623 --> 19:20.393
A little FBI clout might help
Patton cut a few timely corners.

19:20.427 --> 19:23.596
Since when do you
need help cutting corners?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.699
All right.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.244
Good job.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.379
Go learn things.
Yeah, all right.
Thank you.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.391
Hey.

19:53.726 --> 19:57.230
Sorry I didn't try
to help out sooner.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.965
You know, maybe none of this
would have happened.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.368
No, it's not your fault.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.803
Like you said,
I should have called.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.305
I would have answered.

20:05.338 --> 20:08.241
Yeah?

20:08.275 --> 20:09.376
Yeah.

20:09.409 --> 20:13.280
I wasn't even sure
you'd remember me.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.782
Are you kidding me?
Of course I'd remember you.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.385
You were, like,
the coolest girl in...

20:18.418 --> 20:21.321
You were the coolest,
uh, woman in high school.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.957
Even though, technically,
we were 16,

20:24.991 --> 20:26.759
so I don't know
if you were a woman.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.428
I don't really know
how that works.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.965
How come you never
asked me out?

20:32.999 --> 20:35.568
You mean on, like, a date?

20:35.602 --> 20:36.903
Are you serious?

20:36.936 --> 20:38.638
It's an unwritten
high school law--

20:38.671 --> 20:41.274
you never ask out anybody
who's out of your league.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.775
It's punishable by death.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.512
Or worse, you know...
humiliation.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.247
Yeah, well, look who's
humiliated now.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.755
Listen to me.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.058
I'm gonna help you
get out of this, okay?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.494
I promise.

21:02.529 --> 21:03.530
Get down, get down!

21:13.906 --> 21:15.041
What are we gonna do?
Ah...

21:19.479 --> 21:21.348
Let's go.
Go

21:21.381 --> 21:22.549
Away from the bullets.
Come on.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.319
Go, go, go, go.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.634
Did you really just
do that, Lanky Pants?

21:41.668 --> 21:43.035
Yeah, I think so.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.504
And don't call me
"Lanky Pants," all right?

21:44.537 --> 21:46.873
I hate Lanky Pants.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.675
Come on, let's go.
Let's go!

21:59.051 --> 22:01.854
All that matters is that you
and Adrian are all right.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.891
Just get back here quick.
We'll figure it out.
SEBASTIAN: Okay.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.059
They're pretty shook up,
but okay.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.795
Thank God.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.062
Can't believe Sebastian
blew up a car to get away.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.898
That's pretty impressive.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.700
Yeah, but how'd The Jackal
even know to attack

22:13.733 --> 22:15.402
the car in the first place?
Don't know,

22:15.435 --> 22:16.869
but we need to find out.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.905
Are your agents all right?
Stable, thankfully.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.940
Sounds like they're lucky
to be alive.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.909
What did Sebastian have to say?
PRIDE: Two gunmen.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.412
One he recognized
as Carr's killer,

22:25.445 --> 22:27.046
Farrel. They were
lying in wait,

22:27.079 --> 22:28.381
opened fire.

22:28.415 --> 22:29.782
But why?
LASALLE: Well, obviously,

22:29.816 --> 22:31.017
to kill Adrian
and thanks to Sebastian,

22:31.050 --> 22:32.452
that didn't happen.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.053
Yeah, but if The Jackal
is behind this,

22:34.086 --> 22:36.923
why would he first try to
frame Adrian,

22:36.956 --> 22:39.826
and then suddenly turn around
and try to kill her instead?

22:39.859 --> 22:42.128
And I repeat, how did he know
she was being moved

22:42.161 --> 22:44.030
to the FBI?
They just left.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.599
ISLER: Don't look at me.
After the last mole,

22:46.633 --> 22:48.501
the FBI re-vetted every agent.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.537
Changed our entire
digital security, too.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.171
Wouldn't necessarily be enough
to stop somebody

22:52.204 --> 22:54.073
like The Jackal.
PATTON: And it won't

22:54.106 --> 22:56.042
stop him here, either.
Turn everything off now.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.744
Computers, plasmas.
Shut it all down.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.111
LASALLE:
What's going on, Patton?

22:59.145 --> 23:01.147
I kept trying to trace
The Jackal's virus,

23:01.180 --> 23:02.682
looking for his
digital signature,

23:02.715 --> 23:05.084
I found it.
It's all over us.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.554
He didn't just penetrate
our firewalls.

23:07.587 --> 23:08.855
He's listening
to everything we do.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.122
In fact, dump your cell phones,

23:10.156 --> 23:11.924
and your Bluetooth watches.
Everything.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.159
ISLER: Adrian must know
something awfully important

23:13.192 --> 23:14.661
for him to go through all this.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.496
Let's figure that out later.

23:16.529 --> 23:19.065
Is anything safe here?
I doubt it.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.833
I wouldn't even trust the FBI
at this point, either.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.134
The Jackal is that good.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.670
That's why he tried
to kill Adrian.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.438
Knows that we're not buying
the setup.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.006
All right. You and Sonja
call Sebastian.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.908
Use the pay phone
on Bourbon Street.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.910
Tell him not to come back here.
Ditch his cell phone.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.945
And get Adrian
someplace safe.

23:32.979 --> 23:36.048
Okay, but how are we supposed
to contact him after that?

23:36.082 --> 23:37.750
Tell him when this is all over,

23:37.784 --> 23:39.552
we're gonna go celebrate.

23:39.586 --> 23:40.787
Copy that.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.121
All right.
And then go to where

23:42.154 --> 23:44.090
Sebastian and Adrian
were ambushed.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.693
We need leads if we're
gonna find The Jackal.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.127
You got it.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.997
Yeah, but how are we supposed
to do any of this

23:51.030 --> 23:53.032
without technology?

23:53.065 --> 23:55.234
Don't need technology.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.470
We're gonna go old school.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.510
I just got this.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.984
All right, come on, come on.

24:12.018 --> 24:15.021
We got to move.
Let's go.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.689
What's the matter?

24:16.723 --> 24:19.025
What's the matter?
What

24:19.058 --> 24:20.827
Somebody just tried
to kill us.

24:20.860 --> 24:24.631
Well, actually, I think they're
really only after you, so...

24:24.664 --> 24:25.965
That didn't come out
right, at all.
I don't understand.

24:25.998 --> 24:26.966
Why is this happening?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.100
Why does someone
want to hurt me?

24:28.134 --> 24:29.869
I-I didn't do anything.
I'm nobody.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.804
Whoa, whoa. H-Hold on.
You're not nobody, okay?

24:31.838 --> 24:33.740
I mean, you weren't a
nobody in high school

24:33.773 --> 24:35.575
when you were making, like, the
greatest zine I've ever read.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.043
And you're not a nobody now,

24:37.076 --> 24:38.878
when everyone
wants to kill you.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.581
Point being,
in my experience,

24:41.614 --> 24:43.115
if there are, like,
bad guys after you,

24:43.149 --> 24:47.720
you're pretty
important, okay?

24:47.754 --> 24:48.921
What?

24:48.955 --> 24:51.223
Nothing. It's just, I...

24:51.257 --> 24:54.994
I can't believe
how much you've changed.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.229
Nerdy, geeky, pimply.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.065
I was, I was pretty pimply.

24:59.098 --> 25:02.001
I was gonna say quiet.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.903
But now you're like...

25:03.936 --> 25:06.272
I don't know... badass.

25:06.305 --> 25:09.208
Badass? Hello.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.611
Really

25:11.644 --> 25:13.646
You just blew up a car
and saved my life.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.214
Yeah, I think so.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.116
Yeah. You know, I don't want
to brag, either, but that's,

25:17.149 --> 25:19.118
that's not the first
car I've blown up.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.788
Come on, we got to go.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.790
You got to help me figure out
why The Jackal wants you dead

25:23.823 --> 25:27.059
before he
actually kills you.

25:27.093 --> 25:30.129
PATTON:
Oh, man, Pride.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.164
1980s flashback.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.100
Baby, when you said old school,
Pride, you meant old school.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.202
I haven't seen some of
this stuff in years.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.137
: I haven't seen
some of this stuff ever.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.072
Girl, stop. You ain't
that much younger than us.

25:40.106 --> 25:43.042
Some of it's leftover
from the garage sale

25:43.075 --> 25:45.645
I never got around to
after my divorce.

25:45.678 --> 25:48.615
And the rest is from my
post-Katrina emergency kit.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.883
Oh, is this part of your kit?

25:50.917 --> 25:53.252
That was Laurel's.
It's a keepsake.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.855
Hmm.
PRIDE:
I haven't used a landline

25:55.888 --> 25:56.989
since the bar
got blown up.

25:57.023 --> 26:00.192
I'm hoping it works.
PATTON:
Only one way to find out.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.894
Plug it in.
Still not sure how we're

26:01.928 --> 26:04.363
gonna find this cyber
king without cyber.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.198
Same way we used to find things:

26:06.232 --> 26:08.167
with good old-fashioned
police work,

26:08.200 --> 26:09.902
and boots on the ground.
Yeah, but we don't even

26:09.936 --> 26:11.971
know who The Jackal is.
We don't know what he's up to.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.205
We don't even know
where to begin.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.274
We begin with the muscle.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.276
We find Farrel,
we find The Jackal.

26:17.309 --> 26:20.146
Although we may not be able to
communicate, they still have to.

26:20.179 --> 26:23.249
Yeah, and trying to kill Adrian
the way he did leaves a trail.

26:23.282 --> 26:26.753
A real trail. Hopefully,
some of the clues

26:26.786 --> 26:28.655
that Chris and Sonja
found at the scene

26:28.688 --> 26:31.290
will help us.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.660
Dial tone. Uh-huh.
That's great.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.194
Meanwhile, we need
to try and figure out

26:35.227 --> 26:37.630
what The Jackal
ultimately wants.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.231
According to Isler,
he wants money,

26:39.265 --> 26:41.167
so he's like
a digital bank robber.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.936
It must be a lot of money for
him to go through all of this.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.638
Yes.
Hey, could you
help me unfurl this map?

26:45.672 --> 26:47.206
Yeah.
Yeah, and it's got
to be connected

26:47.239 --> 26:50.009
to whatever he stole
from Carr's laptop.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.143
What are these stickers?

26:51.177 --> 26:52.712
These are IP addresses

26:52.745 --> 26:53.980
The Jackal bounced signals
off of

26:54.013 --> 26:55.181
when I was tracing his virus.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.849
I tried to narrow down
potential hideouts

26:56.883 --> 26:58.384
when we had to go dark.

26:58.417 --> 26:59.886
Krewe Du Brew Cafe.

26:59.919 --> 27:02.154
Oh, that's a high-speed
Internet cafe.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.355
That's one of
the possibilities.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.724
What is it, Pride?

27:04.757 --> 27:08.160
Chris...

27:08.194 --> 27:12.164
Chris found a Krewe Du Brew
coffee cup at the ambush.

27:12.198 --> 27:14.834
Could have fallen out of
Farrel's car during the attack.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.235
Go tell Chris and Sonja
forget the supplies.

27:16.268 --> 27:17.904
They need to go
stake out this cafe.

27:17.937 --> 27:18.938
Do you want me
to stay with them?

27:18.971 --> 27:20.072
No, we're low on manpower.

27:20.106 --> 27:21.273
Come right back.
Okay.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.875
All right. And I...

27:22.909 --> 27:25.311
will call Isler for backup.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.918
I still don't understand what
we're doing in a high school.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.353
Well, you said that Nate backed
up everything on a cloud, right?

27:34.386 --> 27:36.222
Actually, several clouds.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.691
Other people's clouds.
People that didn't even know.

27:38.725 --> 27:40.226
That's how paranoid he was.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.194
Right, well, that paranoia
might help us figure out

27:42.228 --> 27:43.796
just what The Jackal stole.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.364
Maybe stop him from doing
whatever it is

27:45.397 --> 27:47.033
that he wants to do.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.801
Just as long as he hasn't
found the backup first.

27:48.835 --> 27:51.337
But won't he find us the moment
I go online to search?

27:51.370 --> 27:54.440
Not if we keep
switching computers,

27:54.473 --> 27:57.343
bouncing the signal
around just like he does.

27:57.376 --> 28:00.479
Sauce for the
goose, Mr. Saavik.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.214
I'm sorry.
What's that?

28:02.248 --> 28:04.150
Ancient proverb?

28:04.183 --> 28:06.385
No, it's, uh, Star Trek II:
Wrath of Khan.

28:08.821 --> 28:09.956
You've never seen
Wrath of Khan?

28:09.989 --> 28:11.157
Come on, that's a classic.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.491
You got Kirstie Alley,
she's in her prime,

28:12.524 --> 28:15.327
before Cheers.
She's a half Vulcan, you know.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.963
They put these
little bugs in peoples'...

28:16.996 --> 28:19.966
I just went from, like,
badass to geek in no time flat.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.334
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay. That's fine.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.203
I just, uh...
Get over here,

28:24.236 --> 28:26.272
and start searching.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.378
So just, um,
out of curiosity,

28:32.411 --> 28:35.314
you know, to follow up on what
we were talking about before,

28:35.347 --> 28:37.917
if I was a badass
back in high school,

28:37.950 --> 28:39.518
do you think, um...
I don't know,

28:39.551 --> 28:41.420
you think you would have
gone out with me?

28:43.189 --> 28:45.057
I would have
gone out with you anyway.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.394
Really?

28:48.427 --> 28:52.965
Even though we were in, like,
totally different leagues?

28:52.999 --> 28:54.266
I didn't think so.

28:54.300 --> 28:58.104
You just never asked.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.808
Oh, yeah, I didn't really.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.409
:
Stupid.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.544
I'm in.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.113
I've got Nate's files.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.147
Already?

29:08.180 --> 29:09.215
Wait, hold on. Switch.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.983
Ooh.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.223
A lot of files
to go through.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.224
I mean, how do you know
which ones...?

29:18.257 --> 29:21.427
ADRIAN:
Holy crap.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.995
Someone put out
a malware virus

29:23.029 --> 29:24.430
to search the
Internet for...

29:24.463 --> 29:27.834
For Nate's gaming app.
No, no, no. Mine. Side-U.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.301
Nate was testing
it out for me.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.403
That's why it was
on his laptop.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.139
The Jackal stole my game.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.407
Well, why
Nothing special.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.177
Other than it can learn

29:38.210 --> 29:40.346
how players like
to play the game,

29:40.379 --> 29:43.015
and then it can take over for
them if they want it to.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.985
Take over? You mean, like,

29:46.018 --> 29:48.287
like artificial intelligence
take over?

29:48.320 --> 29:50.322
You made a game that can adapt
and think for itself?

29:50.356 --> 29:51.590
I guess, yeah.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.126
Well, I mean, come on.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.162
That's badass.

29:56.195 --> 29:58.865
Actually, you know what?
It might be just bad.

29:58.898 --> 30:01.533
'Cause if The Jackal is as good
as everyone thinks that he is,

30:01.567 --> 30:03.302
then he can use it
to take over

30:03.335 --> 30:04.603
a hell of a lot more
than just games.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.172
I mean, he could
take over banks,

30:06.205 --> 30:08.174
defense systems,
anything he wants.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.342
This could be like
Terminator bad.

30:11.377 --> 30:14.146
Terminator
No.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.282
Okay, that's fine.
That's just a movie that
everyone on Earth has seen.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.349
Not me.
You know what?

30:17.383 --> 30:19.151
It wouldn't have worked
between us in high school.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.552
Probably not.
I feel much better.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.554
Yeah, me, too.
Here, go, switch. Come on.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.227
LASALLE:
We should go in.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.629
See if Farrel's inside.
No, no.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.065
Gregorio said Pride wants
us to wait for backup.

30:33.099 --> 30:34.633
Yeah, well, there sure
is a lot of waiting

30:34.666 --> 30:36.568
doing things old school.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.504
It's a miracle they
got anything done.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.239
There. That's Farrel.

30:46.278 --> 30:49.148
SONJA:
Wait. Did that guy...?

30:49.181 --> 30:50.950
Did he just spot us?

30:50.983 --> 30:53.352
How does he even
know who we are?

30:53.385 --> 30:55.221
He could if he's The Jackal.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.923
Don't lose him.
Don't worry.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.163
That won't be necessary.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.202
Turn left here.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.438
Wish we could call it in.
Just ram him.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.080
THE JACKAL:
Almost there.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.185
Got him.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.992
Unbelievable.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.694
What happened?
I don't know.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.263
The thing just shut off.

31:43.102 --> 31:44.436
We've been jackaled.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.243
(horns honking,
cackling continues)

32:01.387 --> 32:04.456
All right, just stay offline,
and stay put.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.292
You and Adrian are safe
where you are for now.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.559
PATTON:
Hey, where y'all been?

32:07.593 --> 32:09.295
Did you guys find Farrel?
Yes and no.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.230
We tried calling,
but the line was busy.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.332
At least that's what I think
that beeping tone was.

32:13.365 --> 32:14.733
Yeah. Talking to Sebastian.
What happened?

32:14.766 --> 32:16.468
We got jackaled
is what happened.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.137
Wait, you saw him, The Jackal?

32:18.170 --> 32:19.571
If so, he spotted us first.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.974
And he hacked into the SUV
and shut it down completely.

32:22.008 --> 32:24.176
It's still stuck.
We had to hoof it back here.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.712
Dude. He used your license plate
to get your VIN number

32:26.745 --> 32:28.580
to hijack your SUV's

32:28.614 --> 32:30.316
CAN system.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.718
This dude is fast.
I couldn't even do that.

32:32.751 --> 32:35.321
Yeah, because you
don't have the AI app

32:35.354 --> 32:36.388
that he stole from Carr.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.290
AI

32:38.324 --> 32:40.192
No, not Carr's, Adrian's.

32:40.226 --> 32:43.329
According to Sebastian, The
Jackal stole her gaming app,

32:43.362 --> 32:46.665
so that he could use it to-to
take over any network he wants.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.500
So he can control it.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.502
It's like having
a digital skeleton key.

32:50.536 --> 32:51.570
SONJA:
Is that how he hacked into

32:51.603 --> 32:54.373
the squad room and knew
everything we were doing?

32:54.406 --> 32:56.342
Obviously not his end goal,
though.

32:56.375 --> 32:59.178
Which begs the question-- what
does he want with Adrian's app?

32:59.211 --> 33:01.347
Looks like $20 million,

33:01.380 --> 33:03.182
but I'm guessing
that's just for starters.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.583
Got an alert
he just hacked into

33:04.616 --> 33:07.253
Atlanta International.
Apparently, he's taken over

33:07.286 --> 33:09.488
air traffic control.
FAA's locked out completely.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.523
Says if he doesn't get
his money in three hours,

33:11.557 --> 33:13.292
planes start crashing
into each other.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.561
Can he really do that?
Nothing stopping him so far.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.463
Unless we stop him.

33:17.496 --> 33:21.300
He's got to be controlling
it remotely, right?

33:21.333 --> 33:22.501
Which means,
theoretically,

33:22.534 --> 33:24.703
you can trace it to where he is.

33:24.736 --> 33:27.306
And if it's the same guy that
hacked into the SUV, he's still

33:27.339 --> 33:29.275
in town, too.
You know what?

33:29.308 --> 33:30.776
That narrows down
the possibilities,

33:30.809 --> 33:32.544
since he'd need
some serious bandwidth

33:32.578 --> 33:34.713
to hijack something as powerful
as air traffic control.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.782
Probably like

33:36.815 --> 33:38.750
microwave links, like...
Cell towers?

33:38.784 --> 33:41.420
Exactly, except
only recently updated ones,

33:41.453 --> 33:43.522
fiber optic cables, but there's
not that many in this area.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.824
All right, let's
split up, find 'em.
PRIDE: Okay.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.127
But be careful. If
The Jackal's at any one

33:48.160 --> 33:50.129
of those towers, that means
that Farrel will be there, too.

33:50.162 --> 33:52.098
LASALLE:
Got it.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.539
Any chance you can override it?

34:00.572 --> 34:02.841
Man, not with this relic.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.476
Maybe not
with anything.

34:04.510 --> 34:07.446
You know, the only person
who might have a chance

34:07.479 --> 34:10.816
is the person who created
the app in the first place.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.785
I can't destroy my own app.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.555
I mean, I wouldn't
even know how to.

34:16.588 --> 34:19.391
Yeah, but don't you have
a, like, a back door, you know?

34:19.425 --> 34:20.659
Another way in?
No.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.494
It's just a gaming app.
I never imagined

34:22.528 --> 34:24.830
that it was gonna be used
to possibly kill people!

34:27.666 --> 34:31.337
All right, Adrian, look,
I-I know that this is a lot.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.472
Okay? I mean, this stuff
freaked me out, too,

34:33.505 --> 34:37.243
at first, but believe me, if
I can do it, then you can...

34:37.276 --> 34:39.345
Sebastian,
I'm not freaking out.

34:39.378 --> 34:40.412
I'm thinking.
Yeah, that's...

34:40.446 --> 34:41.513
Okay.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.182
I might not be able
to destroy the app,

34:43.215 --> 34:45.784
but I might be able
to make a back door.

34:45.817 --> 34:48.820
At least I can try.
Wait. What are you doing?

34:48.854 --> 34:51.623
I can't make a back door
if I can't get to the app.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.625
Since we know where and
how he's working now,

34:53.659 --> 34:55.294
I should be able
to find it.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.596
Yeah, but-but if you go online
to find it, doesn't that mean

34:57.629 --> 34:59.665
he can then find us here,
like, right away?

34:59.698 --> 35:01.633
I'm not letting people
die because of me.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.469
SEBASTIAN: Totally,
but, uh, hear me out.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.904
What if those people are named
Sebastian and Adrian?

35:05.937 --> 35:08.574
Thought you
were a badass?

35:08.607 --> 35:12.511
Well, obviously,
I'm a badass.

35:12.544 --> 35:15.181
I'm just not
a stupid badass.

35:16.882 --> 35:19.651
That was Gregorio.
She struck out.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.220
Chris and Sonja, too.

35:21.253 --> 35:22.821
No sign of The Jackal
at any of the cell towers.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.457
Maybe we should pay the ransom.
We can't.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.626
He'll just keep holding
up more networks,

35:27.659 --> 35:30.529
putting more people at risk
unless we stop him now.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.398
We have two hours
and three minutes to stop him

35:32.431 --> 35:33.632
before planes start falling
out of the sky.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.602
Okay. Any luck
backtracing the signal?

35:36.635 --> 35:38.637
Doing the best I can.
This thing is a dinosaur.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.473
It's not a speed demon.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.209
All right, all
right, all right.

35:43.242 --> 35:44.443
Score one for the good old days.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.545
The Jackal is
controlling everything

35:46.578 --> 35:48.780
from the airport in Slidell.
PRIDE: Yeah, that makes sense.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.582
Air traffic controls
are connected, right?

35:50.616 --> 35:52.918
Which means that you can use
one to hack into the other,

35:52.951 --> 35:54.620
especially if there's
little security.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.722
I'll call for backup on the way.
All right. Good work, P.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.624
Tell the team where
we're headed when they call.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.791
Copy that.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.434
Hello? Tru Tone.
SEBASTIAN: Patton, thank God.
Listen to me.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.436
We're at this high school
right now, we're trying...

36:10.469 --> 36:12.571
Sebastian, calm down.
We need backup.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.506
There's no backup here
to be had.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.708
What are you talking about?
I'm here by myself.

36:22.581 --> 36:25.784
Federal agents!
Clear out! ATC office?

36:25.817 --> 36:28.854
Check over there.
No one gets in or out.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.190
MAN: Clear the
rear entrance!

36:48.640 --> 36:50.676
Cocky bastard.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.644
Just better hope
Adrian can stop it.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.590
Uh, I don't want
to pressure you,

37:04.623 --> 37:07.359
but we're running out of time.
I'm almost in.
I just need

37:07.393 --> 37:08.894
a couple more minutes.
We don't really
have a couple of minutes.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.996
Why not?

37:12.464 --> 37:13.599
That's why not.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.036
What are we gonna do?!
I have no idea.

37:34.986 --> 37:39.791
You, that way! Go!

37:42.494 --> 37:44.496
Do you think
they got scared off?

37:44.530 --> 37:45.997
I doubt it.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.636
Please tell me you know
how to shoot a gun.
No!

37:50.669 --> 37:53.472
No. Okay. Yeah, sure. All right,
uh, hold it with two hands.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.774
Oh, what?
All right, and if you have to
shoot, shoot it at his chest,

37:55.807 --> 37:57.343
all right
You got it.
I don't know.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.945
Stay here.
Okay. Okay.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.399
Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him!

38:30.409 --> 38:31.377
Well...

38:43.455 --> 38:45.791
You two all right?
I think so, yeah.
Are you all right?

38:45.824 --> 38:48.494
I don't know. I don't know. I...

38:48.527 --> 38:50.996
It's been a hell of a couple
days, that's for sure.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.431
All right.
All right.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.500
How did you guys
even find us?

38:54.533 --> 38:55.767
I mean, I'm-I'm
not complaining.

38:55.801 --> 38:58.404
Yeah, well, you hung up
just before we got back

38:58.437 --> 38:59.905
to Pride's bar,
so Patton told us.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.573
Look, come on,
let's get you two out of here

39:01.607 --> 39:02.974
in case
Jackal sent someone else.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.910
Pride hasn't found him yet?
Afraid not.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.545
And, look, we're running out
of time, too,

39:06.578 --> 39:07.779
so let's go.

39:07.813 --> 39:09.948
You can find him,
though, right?

39:12.818 --> 39:14.386
Yeah.

39:14.420 --> 39:15.687
Yeah.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.389
Okay, come on. Come on.

39:26.598 --> 39:29.134
You're cutting it close.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.102
Did they transfer
all of the money?

39:31.136 --> 39:33.472
SEBASTIAN: Nope. Oh, and those
planes are still in the sky.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.506
Who is this?

39:38.143 --> 39:39.778
SEBASTIAN:
You know it's not safe

39:39.811 --> 39:41.513
to talk on your phone
and drive, right?

39:41.547 --> 39:43.181
It also was not a smart idea
to pair it

39:43.214 --> 39:44.716
to your car
since that's how we hacked it.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.853
You can call it car-ma.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.655
Who are you?

39:49.688 --> 39:52.524
What? Oh, I am NCIS, pal,

39:52.558 --> 39:54.993
and you are under arrest
for, like, a lot.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.462
Uh, underestimating my friend

39:56.495 --> 39:58.196
whose app you stole,
among other things.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.699
Including killing my friend.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.968
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, right. So, listen, this is
the way I see this going down.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.570
You've got one of two options.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.505
One is, you can run

40:06.538 --> 40:08.974
and hope that alligators
don't like the taste of Jackal,

40:09.007 --> 40:11.810
or you can just sit there
and wait for the FBI helicopter

40:11.843 --> 40:15.046
that is currently en route to
arrest you right now.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.882
ADRIAN: What are you doing?
That's a jackal.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.585
Is that more of a hyena?
It's a wild animal of some sort

40:19.618 --> 40:21.853
that lives in the Sahara.
You know what?

40:21.887 --> 40:24.723
Why don't you try to do it?

40:30.596 --> 40:32.564
PRIDE:
All right, here's the deal.

40:32.598 --> 40:34.666
To Sebastian.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.835
You took the lead
and caught The Jackal.

40:38.537 --> 40:39.738
Hey!
Hear, hear!

40:39.771 --> 40:41.607
To be fair, Adrian
caught The Jackal, you know,

40:41.640 --> 40:43.108
or at least
tracked him down.

40:43.141 --> 40:45.477
Hey, all I care about,
all the FBI cares about

40:45.511 --> 40:47.546
is that he's finally
behind bars, so...
Amen.

40:47.579 --> 40:48.780
Thanks to Lanky Pants!

40:50.549 --> 40:51.950
Patton, I love you, seriously,

40:51.983 --> 40:53.952
but if I hear that name again,
I-I might kill you.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.954
SONJA: Ooh, murder.
Ooh. Cranky Lanky Pants.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.188
Hey!

40:57.222 --> 40:58.524
That's more accurate.

40:58.557 --> 40:59.525
PRIDE:
But seriously,

40:59.558 --> 41:01.092
you all did good,
all of you.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.094
I'm proud of you.

41:03.128 --> 41:06.865
Might just start taking
a little more time off.
Well, I'll drink to that.

41:06.898 --> 41:09.501
How come Adrian's not here?
I mean, where is she, man?

41:09.535 --> 41:11.770
Yeah, hey, without her, we
wouldn't have caught The Jackal.
Yeah.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.939
You're not just gonna
let her go, right?
Right?

41:13.972 --> 41:16.107
What do you mean?
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

41:16.141 --> 41:18.209
She likes you.
No.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.678
Yeah, it's called a connection,
like the old days,

41:19.711 --> 41:21.680
before all this
technology crap.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.515
You know what? What are you even
doing sitting here right now?
Exactly.

41:23.549 --> 41:25.517
You should be out
looking for her!
I'm hanging out with my friends

41:25.551 --> 41:26.885
after, like,
a high-octane adventure.
Where are they going?!

41:26.918 --> 41:28.687
They're not going
anywhere. Come on!

41:28.720 --> 41:30.656
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, all right. Okay.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.991
I'm going. All right,
all right. Enough!
Go!

41:33.024 --> 41:35.561
SEBASTIAN: I'm going.

41:35.594 --> 41:37.829
(techno music playing,
lively chatter)

41:46.605 --> 41:48.940
Oh! Excuse me.
Oh. I'm sorry. That was
way harder than I meant.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.576
I can't see in this...
Sebastian?

41:50.609 --> 41:52.611
Yeah. How'd you know
it was me?

41:52.644 --> 41:54.680
Lucky guess.

41:54.713 --> 41:57.282
What are you doing here?

41:57.315 --> 42:00.686
Oh, uh, well, you know,
I'm just wondering

42:00.719 --> 42:05.924
if maybe sometime,
if you're not busy, that is,

42:05.957 --> 42:07.559
uh, refusing to watch
really popular movies,

42:07.593 --> 42:10.128
you want to get together,
you know?

42:10.161 --> 42:12.163
We can talk about all
the times that we almost died,

42:12.197 --> 42:13.899
or we, you know, or we don't
have to. You're busy.
Wait.

42:13.932 --> 42:16.702
Are you asking me out?
Yes, kind of, yeah.

42:16.735 --> 42:21.607
I just, you know, I figured,
better late than never.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.242
Yes, I'll go out with you.

42:24.275 --> 42:26.712
Yeah?
