WEBVTT

00:22.974 --> 00:24.129
Everyone down!

00:24.229 --> 00:26.408
Down on the floor! Down on the ground!

00:26.508 --> 00:29.734
Just listen to me,
and no one will get hurt.

00:29.834 --> 00:33.077
- Lock the door. Lock it.
- No, no. Please, please don't.

00:42.323 --> 00:44.209
Wake up.

00:45.493 --> 00:47.606
Wake up, sleepy head.

00:54.335 --> 00:55.999
Hi.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.849
Hi.

01:00.708 --> 01:02.567
Hey, are you okay?

01:03.445 --> 01:05.681
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

01:05.781 --> 01:07.478
I don't know. It's just...

01:07.949 --> 01:12.265
these past couple days
you just seem... different.

01:14.622 --> 01:16.435
I'm okay.

01:23.731 --> 01:26.191
Look, we're going to make this work.

01:26.291 --> 01:29.738
We're going to get on our feet.
We're going to get out of this town.

01:29.838 --> 01:33.852
We're never going to look back. Ever.

01:38.046 --> 01:40.182
This whole county was Indians.

01:40.282 --> 01:43.105
Just open land as far
as the eye could see.

01:43.205 --> 01:47.107
- You know how the settlers took over?
- I heard they won it in a poker game.

01:48.457 --> 01:52.461
- I'm serious here.
- Okay. They had superior fire power?

01:52.561 --> 01:54.346
Nope. More complicated than that.

01:54.446 --> 01:58.384
They couldn't just go in there guns blazing.
They were hopelessly outnumbered.

01:58.634 --> 02:01.436
What they did was they pitted
the tribes against each other

02:01.754 --> 02:04.740
and they stirred up
a whole bloody Indian war.

02:04.840 --> 02:08.301
After the dust settled and the tribes
had just about wiped each other out,

02:08.602 --> 02:13.149
those old generals just waltzed in
and took it for themselves.

02:13.649 --> 02:15.551
At least they got to keep the casinos.

02:15.651 --> 02:19.088
I'm telling you...
we've been cursed ever since.

02:19.188 --> 02:22.858
Cursed? No, I'm not cursed.

02:22.958 --> 02:25.023
You're cursed.

02:41.108 --> 02:42.997
You guys ready?

02:43.097 --> 02:44.693
Yeah.

02:46.313 --> 02:49.280
- You okay?
- Yeah.

02:49.380 --> 02:51.219
Usually I'm the jittery one.

02:51.319 --> 02:54.399
All right. We got this.
Get your game face on.

03:20.716 --> 03:22.518
- Everyone down!
- Oh, God!

03:22.618 --> 03:26.122
Down on the floor! Down on the ground!

03:26.822 --> 03:29.858
Just listen to me,
and no one will get hurt.

03:29.958 --> 03:33.107
Just do as we say, and you can get back
to robbin' everybody else, you got it?

03:33.207 --> 03:35.364
- No, no. Please, please don't.
- Stay down.

03:35.464 --> 03:37.133
- Lock the door.
- I got it.

03:38.133 --> 03:40.436
What the fuck was that?

03:40.836 --> 03:44.273
It's okay. You're going to be okay.
No one's going to get hurt.

03:44.373 --> 03:46.308
Get your cell phone out now.
You got a cell phone?

03:46.408 --> 03:48.874
- Here.
- What about you?

03:48.974 --> 03:51.290
The purse? Great.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.691
How about you, granny?

04:01.906 --> 04:03.719
Jesus Christ.

04:04.326 --> 04:06.929
Hey, hey, hey.
What the fuck you talking to her for?

04:07.029 --> 04:09.811
Get over there in the corner.
You, too. Hurry up.

04:09.911 --> 04:13.062
Hurry up. Now, now.
Move, move, move, move, move.

04:13.402 --> 04:15.114
Stop right there.

04:17.237 --> 04:18.805
Sam?

04:22.734 --> 04:24.555
Hut.

04:35.078 --> 04:37.276
Go, go.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.396
All right, here we go. Right F, 32 dye.

04:41.496 --> 04:44.733
No, listen up. 10, 43, action.

04:44.833 --> 04:48.353
Sam, what's the point?
We're down by 14, man. The game's over.

04:48.453 --> 04:50.940
We're not going to lie down.
We're going to finish this. Come on.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.987
- I'm with you.
- On one. Ready?

05:02.700 --> 05:04.610
Come on.

05:08.956 --> 05:10.318
Ready.

05:10.418 --> 05:12.878
Set. Hut.

06:11.052 --> 06:14.389
You look pretty good for a guy
who just got his ass kicked.

06:14.489 --> 06:16.301
Oh, really?

06:22.296 --> 06:23.999
What?

06:24.599 --> 06:27.302
I just want to remember you like this.

06:27.402 --> 06:30.072
Just like the way you are right now.

06:30.272 --> 06:33.709
Before you go off
to your big fancy college,

06:33.809 --> 06:35.644
big fancy scholarship.

06:35.844 --> 06:38.662
Your fans are going
to be screaming and...

06:39.961 --> 06:41.755
all the girls.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.798
I want to be with you...

06:53.488 --> 06:55.035
and that's never going to change.

07:14.215 --> 07:17.597
Kate? You look beautiful.

07:18.387 --> 07:20.689
You're just saying that.

07:20.789 --> 07:22.400
Hey.

07:27.728 --> 07:29.541
Come here.

07:33.267 --> 07:35.777
I just want to be able
to take care of you.

07:36.305 --> 07:38.850
Well, I can take care of myself.

07:40.241 --> 07:42.947
No, I mean really take care of you.

07:49.583 --> 07:52.061
We used to have plans, you know?

07:53.321 --> 07:55.218
I know.

07:56.590 --> 07:58.670
They're all going to happen.

07:59.394 --> 08:01.763
Everything's going to turn around.

08:02.163 --> 08:05.033
It's just going to take a little
more time than we thought.

08:05.633 --> 08:07.405
That's all.

08:09.737 --> 08:12.551
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

08:21.982 --> 08:24.696
- Don't be late for work.
- I won't.

09:37.091 --> 09:39.060
Look, look, I get it, all right?

09:39.160 --> 09:41.467
You want to work hard, make
an honest living, do it the way dad did it.

09:41.567 --> 09:44.566
But let me tell you something, in case you
haven't noticed, that whole American dream?

09:44.666 --> 09:48.336
That ship has sailed. The world
doesn't work like that anymore.

09:48.436 --> 09:51.707
- You want to see me selling dope?
- It's not about drugs. It's about us.

09:51.807 --> 09:55.210
It's family. You're my little brother,
and I'm trying to help you out.

09:55.310 --> 09:58.997
- I know you're in a tight spot right now.
- And you've got it all figured out?

09:59.097 --> 10:01.950
I hope he doesn't think
he's giving you advice out here.

10:02.050 --> 10:05.086
- How's it going, Annie?
- Oh, it's going.

10:05.186 --> 10:06.738
She needs to take a nap.

10:06.838 --> 10:11.102
Oh, Justice you're so sleepy. I know.

10:13.143 --> 10:16.464
Sam, I'm not just telling you this
to hear myself talk.

10:16.564 --> 10:19.201
This could be a good thing
for both of us.

10:19.901 --> 10:22.595
Yeah. I better go.

10:23.221 --> 10:25.434
Come on. Bring it in.

10:28.876 --> 10:31.894
- Keep punching that clock.
- Yeah.

12:00.701 --> 12:03.705
Hey, come on in.
Yo, you need a beer? Anything?

12:03.805 --> 12:06.507
- No, I'm good.
- Yo, we're going upstairs.

12:06.607 --> 12:08.419
All right.

12:33.734 --> 12:34.936
Sweet.

12:35.036 --> 12:38.182
- You don't want to smoke one?
- I gotta get back.

12:39.974 --> 12:43.712
- You catch the game last night?
- No, I missed it.

12:44.112 --> 12:46.047
I thought everyone around here
watched the games.

12:46.247 --> 12:49.418
Actually, the dude used to play.
A couple of years ago, right?

12:49.518 --> 12:51.897
He busted his ankle first game out.

12:56.356 --> 12:57.742
That's terrible.

12:57.842 --> 13:01.073
- You got any E?
- What you see is what you get.

13:06.066 --> 13:08.772
Sweet, all right. Well...

13:09.571 --> 13:12.440
- Nice doing business with you.
- Yeah.

13:12.540 --> 13:13.671
Come back with some E.

13:42.970 --> 13:45.373
- This is the last one tonight?
- Last one.

13:45.473 --> 13:47.552
Let's get the hell out of here.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.903
Oh, hang on.

14:15.003 --> 14:18.573
- I got a little something for you.
- Oh, shit. Thanks, man.

14:19.173 --> 14:21.720
- It's not bad.
- It's good to have you back.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.505
Yeah.

14:25.145 --> 14:26.749
Dude, that was good.

14:28.149 --> 14:30.067
Hey.

14:30.167 --> 14:32.725
What do you think the markup is on E?

14:34.088 --> 14:36.997
It's a hell of a lot better than weed.

14:37.892 --> 14:39.904
Why do you ask?

14:41.628 --> 14:43.408
Just thinking.

14:43.948 --> 14:45.660
All right.

15:15.128 --> 15:17.500
- Sam?
- Hey.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.557
Where have you been?

15:21.202 --> 15:23.608
I thought I told you
I was picking up an extra shift.

15:25.506 --> 15:28.099
I went down there, Sam.

15:28.543 --> 15:30.011
I went to the factory.

15:30.111 --> 15:32.242
I thought I'd bring you some lunch...

15:32.342 --> 15:36.385
and you weren't there
and they said you got laid off.

15:37.385 --> 15:41.377
So tell me where you were and tell me
what you were doing, and don't lie to me.

15:53.367 --> 15:54.369
What is that?

15:54.469 --> 15:57.982
I figured I ought to make something
out of my college experience.

16:01.775 --> 16:04.212
- You're working for Mike?
- This is for us.

16:04.312 --> 16:07.482
This is not for us, Sam.
I don't need this.

16:07.582 --> 16:09.384
You want to raise our kid here?

16:09.484 --> 16:12.570
What about getting out of here?
Getting out of this town?

16:12.670 --> 16:15.029
You're not a criminal.

16:15.129 --> 16:17.860
You're not Mike. You don't even know
the first thing about it.

16:19.060 --> 16:21.239
It turns out there's not much to it.

16:24.231 --> 16:25.850
Do I have any say in this?

16:25.950 --> 16:28.162
How long have we been saving?

16:33.890 --> 16:37.378
Every week you put half your tips in there,
and at the end of the month it's all gone.

16:37.478 --> 16:39.914
And we still can't pay the bills.

16:40.014 --> 16:41.716
I get it.

16:41.816 --> 16:44.161
But where does it end?

16:47.020 --> 16:49.691
Get them over there.
In the corner. Now. Go.

16:49.791 --> 16:52.260
You think you can come in here
and threaten me? Come in here with a gun?

16:52.360 --> 16:53.745
Who the hell do you think you are?

16:53.845 --> 16:56.864
The money you stole, that's all we want.
Just give us the keys to the safe.

16:56.964 --> 16:58.533
Who are you? Robin Hood?

16:58.633 --> 17:01.636
Hey, check his desk for the keys.

17:02.336 --> 17:04.789
Go ahead. Look all you want.
There's nothing in there.

17:04.888 --> 17:06.657
I never keep the keys on site.

17:07.407 --> 17:09.060
Your father'd be really proud
of you right now.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.906
Don't! Don't you talk about him.

17:13.980 --> 17:16.217
There's nothing in there.

17:16.517 --> 17:19.854
He's lucky he didn't live
to see this. Pathetic.

17:20.654 --> 17:22.424
- No keys.
- That's what I told you.

17:22.523 --> 17:24.492
You want to play it that way, pops?

17:24.592 --> 17:27.628
Look, I've been telling you, there's nothing
in there. You're just not listening to me.

17:27.729 --> 17:29.947
Just give us the money
and let us get out of here.

17:30.047 --> 17:31.783
- You wouldn't be lying to us?
- Fuck you.

18:19.346 --> 18:22.884
Look at that tall drink of water.
Sweet baby Owen.

18:23.184 --> 18:26.598
- Did they pop your cherry in there?
- Lick me.

18:36.163 --> 18:40.202
Well, sweet cheeks, the important thing
is did you learn your lesson?

18:41.402 --> 18:43.682
I learned never
to underestimate a mall cop.

19:03.256 --> 19:07.161
No, numb nuts, don't get caught.

19:07.261 --> 19:08.540
Don't get caught.

19:22.142 --> 19:24.979
You better not have said nothing
to nobody in there.

19:25.079 --> 19:27.280
I didn't say shit.

19:28.115 --> 19:30.385
You better not have or I'll kill you.

19:30.485 --> 19:34.288
I'll drop your body off somewhere
where nobody'll ever find it.

19:34.388 --> 19:36.324
Not even your dear old dad.

19:36.424 --> 19:39.613
Don't be writing no checks
you can't cash, Tuckey.

19:39.778 --> 19:41.329
Come on.

19:41.429 --> 19:44.475
I was just playing. You guys know that.

19:45.999 --> 19:49.420
Dad, why do you hang out
with these assholes?

19:49.520 --> 19:51.773
Come on, now, son. Make up and be nice.

19:52.173 --> 19:54.985
You don't want to hurt
anybody's feelings.

19:56.443 --> 19:59.547
- You got anything lined up?
- Actually, yeah.

20:00.047 --> 20:02.566
Sam wants me to do
a couple runs with him.

20:02.666 --> 20:05.970
Well... Mr. All-American.

20:06.070 --> 20:07.855
You know, it's a good gig.

20:07.955 --> 20:09.821
These college kids will pay top dollar

20:09.921 --> 20:12.293
for some shit that Mike
gets in the city for nothing.

20:12.593 --> 20:14.662
Don't get mixed up
with people like that.

20:14.962 --> 20:16.690
Sam?

20:17.432 --> 20:19.584
We've been best friends
since I was three.

20:19.684 --> 20:22.686
There's two rules that everybody knows.

20:22.786 --> 20:27.296
First one is, don't go in with anybody
who's got more to lose than you do.

20:27.396 --> 20:31.446
- What's the other rule?
- You got cement in your ears?

20:32.146 --> 20:34.215
Don't get caught.

20:34.715 --> 20:37.011
Don't get caught.

20:41.287 --> 20:42.823
All right. Just keep
your mouth shut, okay?

20:42.923 --> 20:45.426
- What am I going to say?
- Nothing. I'm going to do all the talking.

20:45.526 --> 20:47.591
Sam, tell your brother I'm going
to pound him if he says one more thing...

20:47.691 --> 20:50.767
Sam, could you tell your stupid
idiot friend that if he blows this deal...

20:50.867 --> 20:53.084
You're going to make us go back to Everett
with nothing but our dicks in our hands.

20:53.184 --> 20:55.663
Guys, just take it easy.

20:59.072 --> 21:01.318
Is that an antelope?

21:14.821 --> 21:16.023
You got our E or what?

21:16.123 --> 21:18.836
- Hey, what'd I say?
- What?

21:20.760 --> 21:22.841
E's for fucking punks.

21:27.033 --> 21:29.270
This is the real shit.

21:29.370 --> 21:31.172
Molly.

21:31.472 --> 21:37.912
No additives, no preservatives,
just 100% pure MDMA.

21:38.412 --> 21:44.118
You unload this at 25 a pop, you boys'll
make yourself a nice little profit.

21:44.618 --> 21:47.098
Not bad for a few days' work.

21:55.428 --> 21:57.431
I feel good about this.

21:57.531 --> 21:59.754
I like you guys.

22:00.254 --> 22:02.515
Come on, let's celebrate.

22:06.639 --> 22:08.352
There you go.

22:14.414 --> 22:15.768
Nice.

22:16.484 --> 22:18.117
No.

22:18.217 --> 22:20.376
Don't mind if I do.

22:36.569 --> 22:40.242
I'm trusting you boys
with $62,000 of my product.

22:41.642 --> 22:43.459
You all know about Lawrence, right?

22:57.457 --> 23:00.404
I don't want another Lawrence situation.

23:12.472 --> 23:14.341
He's onto us.

23:14.441 --> 23:17.445
If he was onto us,
he would've already pulled us over.

23:18.045 --> 23:20.214
- Mike!
- What?

23:20.314 --> 23:22.364
Just relax, man.

23:23.851 --> 23:25.953
I'm going to turn off up here,
and if he turns off too,

23:26.053 --> 23:28.299
then we'll know that he's onto us.

23:52.947 --> 23:56.151
- Green light, boys.
- Go, go, go, go.

23:57.051 --> 23:59.129
Fuck, man.

24:09.696 --> 24:11.766
We're fine. We're fine.

24:12.566 --> 24:14.335
What are you doing?
Hey, hey, don't do this.

24:14.435 --> 24:16.481
- I'm not going back to prison again.
- Owen!

24:21.140 --> 24:23.153
God dammit.

24:54.007 --> 24:55.288
One second.

25:33.546 --> 25:35.732
Doug's going to kill us.

26:06.378 --> 26:08.091
Mike.

26:09.449 --> 26:11.529
You're a fucking idiot.

26:15.789 --> 26:17.792
What the fuck are we going to do now?

26:17.892 --> 26:19.460
- We got to go back.
- Go back where?

26:19.560 --> 26:22.229
To Doug. Tell him what happened,
ask for more time.

26:22.329 --> 26:24.915
Who do you think you're talking about?

26:25.532 --> 26:28.936
He's a businessman. He doesn't get
anything out of us being dead.

26:29.036 --> 26:31.238
He's a killer, Sam.

26:31.338 --> 26:33.607
If he kills us, he gets nothing.

26:33.707 --> 26:36.677
He gets insurance that nobody
will ever fuck him over again.

26:36.777 --> 26:38.012
Sam, you don't know how this works.

26:38.112 --> 26:42.559
You do not show up to a guy
like Doug empty-handed.

26:44.283 --> 26:46.163
No way.

27:06.873 --> 27:09.643
So we... we ran into a little trouble.

27:09.743 --> 27:13.548
The cops were all over us.
We had to dump the drugs.

27:13.948 --> 27:16.728
We're going to get your money, we just...
we just need a little more time.

27:19.652 --> 27:22.790
Children are supposed
to be afraid of fairy tales.

27:22.890 --> 27:26.510
It's through these stories
they learn to fear the big bad wolf,

27:26.610 --> 27:29.980
beware the old lady who lives
in the candy cane house,

27:30.230 --> 27:32.846
and the troll under the bridge.

27:33.867 --> 27:37.214
Each one is a little warning.

27:47.813 --> 27:51.719
The messages, they've...
they've become forgotten.

27:51.819 --> 27:54.956
They lose their power.

27:55.456 --> 27:57.155
So...

27:57.642 --> 27:59.583
stories...

28:02.150 --> 28:03.957
they need to be retold.

28:06.199 --> 28:08.035
I like you, man.

28:08.535 --> 28:11.028
I prefer a happy ending.

28:18.244 --> 28:20.491
You got 48 hours.

28:39.231 --> 28:43.147
If we're going to pull this off,
we better have a plan.

28:45.371 --> 28:49.243
Entrance, main office,
four employees, Pete's office,

28:49.543 --> 28:51.612
Pete's safe.

28:52.062 --> 28:54.515
Average police response time
is 8 to 10 minutes.

28:54.615 --> 28:57.652
- What's the security like?
- None.

28:58.552 --> 29:01.431
We're in and out in seven minutes.

29:04.090 --> 29:06.203
Oh, shit.

29:09.945 --> 29:13.133
Robbery in progress. I request backup.

29:13.233 --> 29:16.170
3013. Request 3013 Colby.

29:16.270 --> 29:18.605
Repeat, request backup.
Robbery in progress.

29:18.705 --> 29:22.876
<i>10-4. 3013 Colby Avenue.
Requesting additional units.</i>

29:22.976 --> 29:25.846
<i>Will advise. Proceed with caution.</i>

29:25.946 --> 29:28.058
<i>All available units...</i>

29:38.624 --> 29:41.695
Hey, just give us the money
and let us get out of here.

29:41.795 --> 29:44.765
- Pete?
- What the fuck is going on back there?

29:45.390 --> 29:47.101
Jesus, man.

29:47.201 --> 29:48.572
Hey!

29:48.872 --> 29:51.882
- Enough!
- Then you get the keys.

29:57.152 --> 29:59.913
- Please just let us go.
- Somebody please shut her the fuck up.

30:00.013 --> 30:02.583
- Get the fuck... get on the ground.
- She's scared. She's scared.

30:02.683 --> 30:04.618
Didn't I tell you
not to fucking touch her?

30:04.718 --> 30:09.823
This isn't your problem, all right?
Just stay cool. This is not about you.

30:09.923 --> 30:11.960
Pu the gun down!

30:13.660 --> 30:16.797
- What are you doing here?
- I know all about you guys.

30:16.897 --> 30:18.957
- Jerome...
- How do you know anything?

30:19.057 --> 30:20.665
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Put it down.

30:20.765 --> 30:22.279
You put it down.

30:33.079 --> 30:36.750
- And your dinner is served.
- Thank you.

30:36.850 --> 30:39.353
I even snuck in extra coleslaw for you.

30:39.928 --> 30:41.059
Don't tell.

30:42.890 --> 30:47.628
Why do they make you do this?
If you're, like... you know.

30:47.728 --> 30:50.297
Nobody makes me do anything.

30:50.397 --> 30:52.666
Plus, they say it's actually good
to be on your feet.

30:52.766 --> 30:55.680
It... helps the baby get into position.

30:58.337 --> 31:01.725
So, you got any big plans tonight?

31:01.825 --> 31:05.096
Just... just heading over to the tavern.

31:05.546 --> 31:09.149
Oh, the tavern? Is that right?

31:09.449 --> 31:12.520
Is there anybody you're looking
to see over there?

31:12.620 --> 31:14.254
No.

31:14.354 --> 31:18.035
No one named, I don't know, Brandy?

31:20.226 --> 31:23.231
- What did I tell you about her?
- I know. I know.

31:24.231 --> 31:25.966
And you just keep going back?

31:26.066 --> 31:29.803
Did you ever wish that things
were different?

31:29.903 --> 31:31.907
You know, like...

31:32.964 --> 31:34.841
in your life?

31:34.941 --> 31:35.945
Jerome...

31:36.445 --> 31:39.167
you think I want to be working here
everyday living in a shoebox

31:39.267 --> 31:40.858
waiting for this baby to pop?

31:43.515 --> 31:44.928
I...

31:47.687 --> 31:50.657
Look, if you see my fiance there,

31:50.757 --> 31:53.026
you tell him the beer's cheaper
in our fridge, all right?

31:53.126 --> 31:56.540
- Yeah.
- All right. Have a good night.

32:28.060 --> 32:29.663
Face it, we're fucked.

32:29.763 --> 32:34.302
We're not fucked, we just...
need to come up with a game plan.

32:35.402 --> 32:36.563
I may have something.

32:38.271 --> 32:40.574
If you were going to rob someone,
who would it be?

32:40.674 --> 32:42.444
- Somebody rich.
- Yeah.

32:42.544 --> 32:46.013
Rich... rich is good, but how about somebody
who couldn't say shit about it?

32:46.513 --> 32:47.815
Like?

32:47.915 --> 32:50.867
Back at Thanksgiving, while you and K
were eating your pumpkin pie,

32:50.967 --> 32:54.087
Uncle Pete wouldn't shut up
about his new boat...

32:54.674 --> 32:56.700
I got some information.

32:59.492 --> 33:01.928
You want to steal from Uncle Pete?

33:02.028 --> 33:06.200
Yeah. He can't say shit because
he's already in it up to his elbows.

33:06.300 --> 33:08.602
Remember when he had to get
that call and he went outside?

33:08.702 --> 33:12.706
I went outside to smoke, and I heard him
talk about some guy named Fergus.

33:12.806 --> 33:16.276
Fergus did what? Are you kidding me?

33:16.376 --> 33:19.280
Jesus Christ. He shot himself?

33:19.780 --> 33:22.749
Look, don't you be going
all chicken shit on me here.

33:22.849 --> 33:26.420
Just keep your mind on what this is
all about. All of that cash.

33:27.120 --> 33:31.292
Fuck Fergus. That bastard'd be
singing like a canary anyway.

33:32.392 --> 33:36.139
This is a better split.
Two ways instead of three.

33:37.930 --> 33:42.626
So I did some detective work,
and it turns out that our friend Fergus,

33:42.976 --> 33:46.773
the one who killed himself,
is formerly of Everett Bank and Trust,

33:46.873 --> 33:50.310
and he had been under indictment
for fraud. Check this out...

33:50.410 --> 33:55.082
more than $500,000 in cash
still unaccounted for.

33:55.182 --> 33:56.283
Holy shit.

33:56.383 --> 33:58.852
Sam worked for him all through high school.
He knows better than anyone.

33:58.952 --> 34:01.618
Anything that Uncle Pete gives
two shits about is in that little save

34:01.718 --> 34:04.641
- in his office, right?
- That was years ago.

34:04.741 --> 34:07.461
Uncle Pete's the kind of guy who's been
wearing the same suit for 20 years.

34:07.561 --> 34:11.697
You're the kind of guy who makes
assumptions that are not always right.

34:11.797 --> 34:15.135
Sam, this is our way out. It's perfect.

34:15.335 --> 34:17.804
What's he going to say? I stole some money
and then they stole it from me?

34:17.904 --> 34:20.216
And then he goes to jail, too.

34:26.145 --> 34:29.917
Hey, can I... Brandy.

34:30.016 --> 34:31.520
Oh, man, Brandy.

34:33.469 --> 34:36.123
- What do we know about robbery anyone?
- It's not a real robbery.

34:36.223 --> 34:39.259
- You just walk in and take it.
- Shut up.

34:39.759 --> 34:41.962
- You guys look so serious.
- Hey, Brandy.

34:42.062 --> 34:43.797
We're... we're busy.

34:43.897 --> 34:46.857
Can I buy you guys some shots?

34:47.534 --> 34:50.170
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose so.

34:50.570 --> 34:53.507
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Brandy.

34:54.206 --> 34:58.312
- What are you doing, man?
- What? What do you mean what am I doing?

34:58.712 --> 35:01.259
She asked if we could have shots.
I said yes.

36:40.145 --> 36:42.559
My parents are sleeping.

36:45.851 --> 36:48.230
Hey, come here. What are you doing?

36:48.330 --> 36:51.801
- What? Let me just get a beer.
- Nope. You're coming with me.

37:34.350 --> 37:37.905
- I gotta go.
- Wait. Talk to me.

37:39.105 --> 37:41.903
I just got to get out of here. This...

37:42.003 --> 37:44.053
was a mistake.

38:02.928 --> 38:06.416
You've... you have everything.
Man, you have everything that you want.

38:06.516 --> 38:10.036
- What are you talking about?
- Any girl. They just throw themselves at you.

38:10.136 --> 38:12.272
You don't know me.
You don't know anything about me.

38:12.372 --> 38:13.907
Jerome.

38:14.407 --> 38:17.694
Jerome, just stay cool. Just stay cool.

38:17.794 --> 38:20.814
Stay cool. Lock the door. Lock the door.

38:21.214 --> 38:23.050
Fuck. I thought I locked it.

38:23.550 --> 38:25.886
- Jerome, give me the gun.
- Hey, face the wall.

38:25.986 --> 38:29.623
- I just can't let your guys do this.
- Sure you can.

38:29.723 --> 38:31.992
We're not even stealing.
The money's already been stolen.

38:32.792 --> 38:36.696
- This is my job.
- Jerome, listen to me.

38:36.796 --> 38:39.133
We need this money. We need it.

38:39.733 --> 38:42.335
We've... we've all known
each other a long time.

38:42.435 --> 38:44.638
Soon this'll all be over.

38:45.038 --> 38:46.792
You'll never hear from us again.

38:52.077 --> 38:53.506
Just give me the gun, Jerome.

38:54.814 --> 38:56.650
Give me the gun.

38:57.350 --> 38:59.262
Give me the gun.

39:06.110 --> 39:07.644
- Fuck.
- What the hell?

39:07.744 --> 39:10.764
- What the...
- Don't stop the party on my account, boys.

39:10.864 --> 39:14.678
- Put the gun down.
- Don't point that gun at me.

39:21.172 --> 39:22.451
Was that...

39:37.406 --> 39:38.475
Mike?

39:39.497 --> 39:42.227
- Mike?
- Oh, God!

39:47.433 --> 39:49.219
Mike.

39:50.320 --> 39:54.885
Mike, Mike, stay with me.
Stay with me, Mike. Stay with me.

40:01.046 --> 40:03.917
Here's to you, the man with the plan.

40:04.762 --> 40:06.703
It's a little early to celebrate
if you ask me.

40:06.803 --> 40:07.887
What are you worried about?

40:07.987 --> 40:11.391
Come on, it's a robbery.
A million things could go wrong.

40:11.691 --> 40:13.059
Like what?

40:13.159 --> 40:16.429
Do you remember the gas station
robbery out on Route 12?

40:16.529 --> 40:18.665
- Sure.
- What did you hear?

40:18.765 --> 40:21.818
One comes in, Randy pulls out a gun

40:21.918 --> 40:23.303
and fucking shoots him
and saves the today?

40:23.403 --> 40:25.054
- Yeah.
- Come on, Randy?

40:25.154 --> 40:27.540
I don't know.
I don't fucking know Randy.

40:27.640 --> 40:29.409
You know Randy. The motherfucker
with the shit in his ears and...

40:29.509 --> 40:31.577
I don't know him that well.
Maybe he fucking got lucky.

40:31.677 --> 40:34.781
- Okay. Well, two guys come in the store...
- I thought there was only one guy.

40:34.881 --> 40:36.884
You gotta fucking listen to me.
Just let me tell the story.

40:37.084 --> 40:39.824
Two guys come in, ski masks on,

40:40.824 --> 40:43.959
coming in with guns,
pull Randy over the counter.

40:45.859 --> 40:48.879
- Gives us the combination. Give it up.
- I don't know.

40:48.979 --> 40:52.242
They don't fucking give us the combination.
Please don't fucking...

40:56.101 --> 40:57.070
You killed him.

40:57.170 --> 40:59.190
Zip freaks out, pulls his mask off,

40:59.290 --> 41:01.583
loses his shit, gets caught
on the security camera,

41:01.683 --> 41:03.910
the guy that he's with... boom...
bangs him in the chest,

41:04.010 --> 41:05.782
lays him out, leaves the gun,

41:06.982 --> 41:09.483
Randy takes the credit,
and as we know it today,

41:09.583 --> 41:13.096
Randy is this fucking bad-ass
gas station gunslinger.

41:15.254 --> 41:17.524
- Where'd you hear that?
- It doesn't matter where I heard it.

41:17.624 --> 41:19.025
I'm just saying we got
to be ready for anything.

41:19.125 --> 41:22.597
I'm not saying you guys are going
to lose your shit like Zip, but...

41:23.197 --> 41:25.298
we have to have a plan.

41:25.398 --> 41:28.968
This seven minutes and out
fantasy is not a plan.

41:29.068 --> 41:33.006
Sounds like a plan to me.
It's a stickup, it's not rocket science.

41:33.606 --> 41:36.409
- Why? Because you say so?
- You got a better idea?

41:36.509 --> 41:37.841
- Who the fuck are you?
- Master criminal?

41:37.941 --> 41:40.747
I don't fucking flush drugs
when I don't have to, you fucking idiot.

41:40.847 --> 41:41.978
- We're trying to come up with a plan.
- Mike.

41:42.078 --> 41:44.665
I was trying to save us all from the cops.
Why you got to bring that shit up?

41:44.765 --> 41:46.496
This isn't helping!

41:51.256 --> 41:54.227
Maybe we are crazy.
Maybe we should just go to the cops.

41:54.327 --> 41:58.315
You want to go to the fucking cops?
And say what? That's crazy.

41:58.415 --> 42:00.600
We could tell that about Doug.
That's got be worth something.

42:00.700 --> 42:02.387
We can't...

42:02.487 --> 42:05.038
If we tell them about Doug, he will find
a way to kill us, all right?

42:05.138 --> 42:09.008
Stop, stop. We're going to go in there,
get the money, and get out of town.

42:09.108 --> 42:11.144
All right?
Enough of this pussy worrying.

42:11.244 --> 42:13.880
No one at Uncle Pete's
is going to want to get shot.

42:13.980 --> 42:16.215
They're going roll over
and show us the goods.

42:16.315 --> 42:19.419
We'll be in and out in seven minutes.
Like my brother said.

42:20.219 --> 42:23.289
- We should have code names.
- What's the point?

42:23.389 --> 42:26.593
So that we can talk to each other
without using our actual names.

42:26.693 --> 42:30.563
- That's ridiculous.
- It's fucking awesome.

42:30.663 --> 42:33.633
It's actually not the worst idea
he's ever had.

42:33.733 --> 42:37.037
If we need each other's attention,
we could just say like, "yo", you know?

42:37.137 --> 42:38.772
Hey, get over.

42:38.872 --> 42:41.808
- Give me all you money!
- That's pretty good. That's pretty good.

42:41.908 --> 42:44.154
Come on, man, be serious.

42:48.513 --> 42:50.618
Oh, yeah? You want to go?

42:52.118 --> 42:54.664
Gorilla versus Death.

42:56.155 --> 42:57.857
I fucking can't see.

42:57.957 --> 43:00.370
- Hey.
- Jesus, man.

43:04.096 --> 43:07.176
That's good. That's scary.

43:13.071 --> 43:16.387
Fucking $14 for a piece of plastic?

43:18.911 --> 43:21.481
Lucky I got that five-finger discount.

43:21.981 --> 43:24.127
Worked out real good last time.

43:27.586 --> 43:29.678
- This all?
- Yeah.

43:30.857 --> 43:34.527
- How's Justice?
- She's good. She's getting big.

43:34.627 --> 43:37.340
I bet she's a cutie just like her papa.

43:38.997 --> 43:42.068
By the way, Brandy's been talking some shit
about you. Says you're a big asshole.

43:42.468 --> 43:45.688
Oh, yeah? Doesn't know
what she's talking about.

43:45.788 --> 43:48.491
That's what I said.
You want a bag for this?

43:49.019 --> 43:52.421
- Nah.
- Yes. Just put it in the bag.

43:55.347 --> 43:58.027
- By, Kirsten.
- Bye.

44:14.733 --> 44:18.147
- You might want to keep that hidden.
- It's in a bag.

44:28.413 --> 44:30.867
- What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

44:30.967 --> 44:32.712
It don't look like nothing.

44:35.487 --> 44:38.325
Hey, pops. How you doing?

44:39.675 --> 44:42.410
One of you suckers got a cigarette?

44:43.029 --> 44:45.298
Yeah, got you covered.

44:48.116 --> 44:50.129
Much obliged.

44:59.878 --> 45:03.316
These bastards are up to some bullshit.

45:04.016 --> 45:06.062
I can smell it.

45:21.667 --> 45:23.169
Dude.

45:23.269 --> 45:27.273
- I've been saving this for a rainy day.
- You got an arsenal.

45:27.373 --> 45:29.943
You never know when you're going
to need some superior firepower.

45:30.043 --> 45:31.611
Don't point it at me.

45:31.711 --> 45:33.574
- It's loaded and ready to go.
- What? Seriously.

45:33.674 --> 45:35.191
Yeah.

45:37.215 --> 45:40.186
All right. If we get in there
and we get 500 Gs,

45:40.286 --> 45:43.016
take away the 60 that we owe Doug,

45:43.116 --> 45:45.792
split it between us, we're still going
to be way ahead of the game.

45:46.292 --> 45:47.861
- Is it 145?
- 145.

45:47.961 --> 45:50.006
145 G's each.

46:12.083 --> 46:14.597
All right. Who's next?

46:24.029 --> 46:26.766
This is no time
to lose sight of the plan.

46:27.266 --> 46:29.769
- Fuck you!
- Stay focused.

46:29.869 --> 46:31.768
- What is he talking about, Sam?
- Let us go, please.

46:31.868 --> 46:33.839
- What's going on?
- Look at what you've done.

46:33.939 --> 46:37.077
- You killed her. You killed her!
- Shut up!

46:37.177 --> 46:40.513
You saw, the bitch went crazy.
I didn't have a choice.

46:40.613 --> 46:43.850
No, this is your fault. You did this.

46:44.350 --> 46:48.037
- We're lucky she only shot one of us.
- There is no "us," Tuckey.

46:48.137 --> 46:52.535
I ain't dropping this gun, boy.
And I ain't gonna die.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.431
You gonna tell him or should I?

46:58.131 --> 47:00.376
Sam, what the hell is going on?

47:34.432 --> 47:37.404
We're closed, Tuck. Come back tomorrow.

47:38.404 --> 47:40.873
I got a sweet tooth.

47:41.527 --> 47:43.234
You know.

47:46.477 --> 47:48.058
How about a piece of that pie?

48:08.033 --> 48:09.323
Attagirl.

48:20.078 --> 48:23.392
- Whipped cream on that?
- Yes, ma'am.

48:35.327 --> 48:37.139
Thank you.

48:42.634 --> 48:45.548
You ever think about
getting out of this town?

48:49.607 --> 48:51.755
I doubt you picked that lock
for the small talk.

48:56.431 --> 48:58.435
Ran into your boy the other day.

48:58.885 --> 49:02.255
Seemed like he was up
to some strange shit.

49:02.355 --> 49:03.924
What's that supposed to mean?

49:04.924 --> 49:07.160
Oh, I don't know.

49:07.960 --> 49:11.598
Seemed like he and his friend Owen
were up to a little caper.

49:12.298 --> 49:15.035
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

49:16.735 --> 49:18.870
You know.

49:19.538 --> 49:21.527
Look, Tuck,

49:22.686 --> 49:27.628
I'm pregnant, and my heart's
racing really fast right now so...

49:29.136 --> 49:31.984
whatever you're doing here,
it's not funny.

49:32.084 --> 49:35.439
Okay? So can you just leave, please?

49:38.556 --> 49:41.041
I wasn't trying to be funny.

49:42.094 --> 49:45.810
And as far as I'm know, an increased
heart rate never hurt a fetus.

49:47.200 --> 49:49.571
I saw a TV show...

49:49.671 --> 49:52.031
about a pregnant woman
who fell eight stories,

49:52.870 --> 49:56.895
landed flat on her belly,
deader than a door nail,

50:00.899 --> 50:02.912
but her baby...

50:03.412 --> 50:05.605
her baby was just fine.

50:08.630 --> 50:09.732
Boo.

50:31.576 --> 50:34.814
- I got her pretty good, didn't I?
- Shut up, Brucey.

50:35.414 --> 50:37.818
Look at your sweet belly.

50:38.918 --> 50:43.356
Just do it for the kid, Kate.
Tell me what I need to know.

50:43.956 --> 50:46.259
I don't know anything.

50:46.359 --> 50:48.160
I already told you.

50:48.260 --> 50:50.096
That's okay.

50:50.196 --> 50:52.775
'Cause I bet you mean
something to somebody.

51:00.322 --> 51:02.147
Sam, why wouldn't you say anything?

51:03.576 --> 51:05.444
That's right.

51:05.544 --> 51:09.391
Let's finish this, fucking amateurs.

51:12.416 --> 51:15.997
Don't fucking look at me.
You turn around and look at the wall.

51:33.204 --> 51:34.974
I am not Sam.

51:35.674 --> 51:39.295
I will not hesitate to blow your kidneys,
intestines, bladder,

51:39.395 --> 51:42.231
and everything else all over this floor.

51:42.481 --> 51:45.895
Now, give me the keys to the safe.

51:50.388 --> 51:52.692
See how easy that was?

51:52.792 --> 51:54.526
That money's not going to change you.

51:54.626 --> 51:58.564
You'll still be the same old
piece of shit you've always been.

52:00.726 --> 52:02.439
Okay.

52:03.903 --> 52:05.518
Oh, God!

52:08.139 --> 52:11.154
Sam? God, he's going to kill him.

52:40.138 --> 52:42.150
Wake up.

52:43.741 --> 52:45.667
Wake up, sleepy head.

52:47.513 --> 52:49.248
Hi.

52:49.348 --> 52:51.084
Hey.

52:51.484 --> 52:53.519
Are you okay?

52:53.619 --> 52:56.489
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

52:56.589 --> 52:59.191
It's just that these past couple days

52:59.291 --> 53:01.298
you seem a little bit different.

53:02.127 --> 53:03.839
I'm okay.

53:06.230 --> 53:10.269
I was doing the laundry earlier and I saw
you had Uncle Pete's card in your pocket.

53:10.369 --> 53:13.440
Is he finally going to give you
a job down there?

53:14.440 --> 53:16.651
Something like that.

53:18.810 --> 53:21.005
Is there something
you're not telling me?

53:21.959 --> 53:24.827
No. Nothing. Don't worry about it.

53:27.285 --> 53:29.888
Look, we're going to make this work.

53:29.988 --> 53:33.423
We're going to get on our feet,
we're going to get out of this town,

53:33.523 --> 53:37.406
and we're never going
to look back. Ever.

53:40.565 --> 53:41.491
Sam?

53:43.869 --> 53:45.558
Sam?

53:45.658 --> 53:47.600
Sam, wake the fuck up.

53:49.907 --> 53:53.078
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'm not going anywhere.

53:53.178 --> 53:55.481
Get the fuck over there with them.

53:55.581 --> 53:57.917
Yeah, scurry. You fucking idiot.

53:58.017 --> 53:59.486
Get the fuck on your belly.
How do you like it?

53:59.586 --> 54:01.487
Make sure you interlock
your fingers behind your back.

54:01.587 --> 54:04.200
You ever had that happen to you,
motherfucker?

54:12.296 --> 54:14.977
That's what I'm talking about.

54:16.997 --> 54:21.040
- Let's just get out of here.
- It ain't that simple.

54:21.540 --> 54:26.000
- What are you talking about?
- We got two dead bodies already.

54:26.512 --> 54:30.015
Any more than that ain't going
to matter in a court of law.

54:30.115 --> 54:33.319
So you can die with them
or come with me.

54:33.819 --> 54:35.964
It's your call.

54:43.595 --> 54:45.832
I'm not killing anyone.

54:46.532 --> 54:48.767
What the fuck are you doing?
Get against the wall.

54:48.867 --> 54:50.969
Sam, hurry the fuck up.

54:51.069 --> 54:54.784
Keep looking at me like that. I'm going
to bust your face up. I promise you.

54:59.344 --> 55:02.115
Get up. Get up.

55:03.315 --> 55:05.885
Remember what your daddy taught you?

55:06.385 --> 55:08.697
Don't get caught.

55:53.898 --> 55:55.711
What's up?

55:57.302 --> 56:01.173
- I thought I was a big asshole.
- Where'd you hear that?

56:01.273 --> 56:04.344
- Everywhere.
- I'm sorry.

56:05.144 --> 56:08.647
Look, look, look.
Hey, you know about me and Annie.

56:08.747 --> 56:11.350
For the sake of Justice
now I can't keep running around.

56:11.750 --> 56:13.585
You weren't thinking about Justice
the other night.

56:13.685 --> 56:16.222
Yeah, because I was thinking
with my dick.

56:16.979 --> 56:19.434
I like that line of thought.

56:23.795 --> 56:26.431
- Brandy.
- You want me to be a little more discreet.

56:26.531 --> 56:28.435
- I get it.
- Okay. Seriously...

56:28.535 --> 56:32.004
Look, look, hey, hey.
You're a beautiful girl. You're great.

56:32.104 --> 56:36.108
- It's just... it's not going to...
- Come on. Don't play hard to get.

56:36.208 --> 56:39.121
- What's this?
- It's nothing.

57:11.776 --> 57:13.979
- You need a lift?
- No, I'm fine.

57:14.079 --> 57:18.050
- Now... come on. It's cold outside.
- No. I'm fine.

57:18.650 --> 57:23.565
All right. Well, I'm just going to drive
alongside you until you make it home safe.

57:26.424 --> 57:32.207
Fine. Want to give me a ride?
Give me a ride if it makes you happy.

57:54.352 --> 57:55.760
Tomorrow.

57:58.522 --> 58:00.093
Tomorrow it is.

58:19.443 --> 58:22.524
I've never been in the front
of one of these before.

58:26.918 --> 58:30.055
What am I doing?
He's got a kid and a wife.

58:30.155 --> 58:32.367
He's bad news.

58:34.892 --> 58:37.896
- Oh, God.
- Are... are you okay?

58:37.996 --> 58:39.431
- You gotta pull over.
- Okay.

58:39.531 --> 58:42.678
- Pull over. Pull over.
- Okay. Okay.

58:54.245 --> 58:56.315
He's a fucking asshole, isn't he?

58:57.215 --> 58:59.118
Why don't you get back in the car?

58:59.918 --> 59:02.419
You know what he had in his pants?

59:02.519 --> 59:04.940
He had a gun. It was loaded.

59:05.040 --> 59:07.059
- I could tell.
- Don't make up stories.

59:07.159 --> 59:11.380
I don't know what he's going to do with it,
but he is up to something. I know that.

59:11.480 --> 59:14.233
You've had a few drinks, all right?
Just... just simmer down.

59:14.333 --> 59:18.171
I'm not lying. He showed it
to me and everything.

59:19.371 --> 59:22.251
Just come on. Get in the car.
Get in the car.

59:38.689 --> 59:40.743
Here you go.

59:41.093 --> 59:45.163
Thanks, Jerome. You've been real sweet.

59:45.263 --> 59:49.278
Oh, my God. Gross!
Jerome, what are you doing?

59:59.844 --> 01:00:01.542
Look...

01:00:02.142 --> 01:00:03.634
I'm sorry.

01:00:06.183 --> 01:00:08.263
I gotta go.

01:00:26.804 --> 01:00:30.509
- Hey, baby, I'm just on my way home.
- <i>Well, hello, cutie pie.</i>

01:00:30.959 --> 01:00:32.901
Who the fuck is this?

01:00:34.413 --> 01:00:36.658
It's your new partner.

01:00:37.582 --> 01:00:41.119
<i>Now you do what I tell you.
You don't say a word to anyone else,</i>

01:00:41.219 --> 01:00:46.740
<i>and maybe you'll get to see
your girlfriend again. You got it?</i>

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.512
Hello?

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:36.335
<i>Hello, Sam, is that you?</i>

01:01:44.815 --> 01:01:47.234
What's going on, babe?

01:01:50.236 --> 01:01:52.100
It's nothing.

01:03:43.334 --> 01:03:45.036
All right.

01:03:45.136 --> 01:03:46.865
Bye.

01:03:48.139 --> 01:03:50.418
I love you, Justice.

01:04:15.866 --> 01:04:18.173
Did you call me last night?

01:04:19.339 --> 01:04:22.561
Yeah. By mistake.

01:04:28.779 --> 01:04:31.860
- You see that moon?
- Yeah.

01:04:34.418 --> 01:04:38.123
What do they say about a full moon?
Is that good luck or bad luck?

01:04:38.223 --> 01:04:40.130
Full moon.

01:04:41.993 --> 01:04:44.306
They say it's good luck.

01:04:46.664 --> 01:04:48.671
It's good luck.

01:04:56.139 --> 01:04:58.186
I'll go get him.

01:05:36.447 --> 01:05:38.983
This whole county was Indians.

01:05:39.083 --> 01:05:42.621
It was just open land as far
as the eye could see.

01:05:43.021 --> 01:05:45.257
You know how the settlers took over?

01:05:45.357 --> 01:05:47.159
I heard they won it in a poker game.

01:05:47.659 --> 01:05:51.443
- I'm serious here.
- Okay. They had superior firepower.

01:05:51.543 --> 01:05:54.838
No. It was more complicated than that.
They couldn't just go in there guns blazing.

01:05:54.938 --> 01:05:57.628
They were hopelessly outnumbered.

01:06:05.008 --> 01:06:06.121
Bruce?

01:06:09.112 --> 01:06:11.183
You know you're never
going to see him again.

01:06:11.283 --> 01:06:14.119
Still not listening to you.

01:06:14.919 --> 01:06:18.423
What do you think Tuckey's going to do
when he gets all that money?

01:06:18.523 --> 01:06:21.928
You think he's going to rush back here
to share it with you?

01:06:23.328 --> 01:06:27.032
I know Tuckey better than anyone.

01:06:27.732 --> 01:06:30.695
That's right. You do.

01:06:34.338 --> 01:06:36.675
Every second that you sit there
is another second Tuckey

01:06:36.775 --> 01:06:39.939
- has to get away with all that cash.
- Goddammit.

01:06:40.945 --> 01:06:44.149
- Shut up!
- I mean, you said it yourself.

01:06:44.649 --> 01:06:46.261
You know him better than anyone.

01:06:55.942 --> 01:06:58.857
- Wait. What are you doing? Stop.
- Let's go.

01:07:01.932 --> 01:07:03.601
No.

01:07:03.701 --> 01:07:05.169
No.

01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:08.321
You thought I was just going to leave you
here all by your lonesome?

01:07:08.421 --> 01:07:09.383
Let me out!

01:07:31.929 --> 01:07:34.466
- Just let us go.
- Quiet.

01:07:34.566 --> 01:07:39.070
Let's stop. Just... I know things
have gotten out of control,

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:42.241
but just stop for a second
and think about what you're doing.

01:07:42.741 --> 01:07:44.693
Two people are already dead.

01:07:44.793 --> 01:07:48.497
Just get out of here. Just go
while you still have the chance.

01:07:48.947 --> 01:07:52.951
We just want to live, and I'm sure
that that's what you want too.

01:07:53.051 --> 01:07:56.288
You know, you don't want
a shoot out or a standoff.

01:07:56.388 --> 01:07:58.523
Just take what you want and go.

01:07:58.623 --> 01:08:01.770
That is some coincidence
you coming in here.

01:08:09.599 --> 01:08:12.320
Bet you wish you never walked
through that door.

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.672
Please, please don't kill me.

01:08:13.772 --> 01:08:16.397
Maybe you should've thought about that
before you stuck your nose

01:08:16.497 --> 01:08:18.692
in other people's bees wax.

01:08:20.178 --> 01:08:21.930
Tuckey, you're not going
to kill these people.

01:08:26.817 --> 01:08:30.665
No. I've done enough killing for today.

01:08:34.892 --> 01:08:37.171
This is your show.

01:08:39.746 --> 01:08:42.853
Go on. Do what your heart tells you.

01:08:48.537 --> 01:08:51.413
- What are you doing? Sam? Please.
- Please, Sam.

01:08:51.814 --> 01:08:54.312
- Please, Sam.
- Sam?

01:08:54.412 --> 01:08:57.792
I know she loves you very much.

01:09:00.917 --> 01:09:03.531
That-a boy.

01:09:06.622 --> 01:09:08.237
Please, Sam. No.

01:09:17.634 --> 01:09:19.837
I figured as much.

01:09:52.769 --> 01:09:56.337
- Don't shoot. We're coming out.
- You, get on the ground!

01:10:15.293 --> 01:10:19.030
<i>This is the police. Come out
with your hands above your head.</i>

01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:20.198
We're fucked, man.

01:10:20.298 --> 01:10:22.650
<i>We have you surrounded.
Put down your weapon.</i>

01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:24.666
<i>You have one minute.</i>

01:11:35.705 --> 01:11:37.675
<i>This is your final warning.</i>

01:11:37.975 --> 01:11:41.656
Prepare to fire. Fire.

01:12:27.157 --> 01:12:29.771
There's no way out, boy.

01:13:32.631 --> 01:13:35.036
We're coming out. Hold your fire.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.514
Clear the hallways.
I want every room clear!

01:15:04.347 --> 01:15:07.862
Mike's dead. We fucked up.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.780
I'm so sorry.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:14.502
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
