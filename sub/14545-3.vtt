<i>(Tessa) In the animal kingdom,</i>

00:03.148 --> 00:05.416

00:10.038 --> 00:13.391
<i>A neighboring matriarch will</i>

00:14.793 --> 00:16.494
What's this?

00:18.563 --> 00:20.114
Are you kidding?

00:20.148 --> 00:23.367
Again with the no pudding.
This is absurd.

00:23.402 --> 00:24.769
Who made you that lunch?

00:24.803 --> 00:26.704
<i>The thing is, dad was</i>
<i>pretty territorial himself.</i>

00:26.738 --> 00:28.656
I don't know, George.
One of the moms.

00:28.690 --> 00:30.491
Which mom?

00:30.542 --> 00:33.277
Sheila? Was it Sheila Shay?

00:33.311 --> 00:35.830
Okay, look, sometimes Sheila
makes me lunch,

00:35.881 --> 00:37.515
and it's usually pretty good.

00:37.549 --> 00:39.850
She's a magician
with the chicken salad.

00:39.885 --> 00:41.485
A magician? Really?

00:41.520 --> 00:42.820
Yeah, but recently, she's been
crapping out on the pudding,

00:42.871 --> 00:44.755
and... (Inhales sharply)
I'm not sure how to broach it.

00:44.790 --> 00:47.617
You don't think it's a little
weird that she makes you lunch...

00:47.618 --> 00:49.176
You're the one who wanted
to move here. Not me.

00:49.211 --> 00:50.628
When I leave you lunch money
every day?

00:50.662 --> 00:52.997
Almost every day.
You forgot twice last week.

00:53.031 --> 00:54.999
But it's not a big deal, George.
On the days you forget,

00:55.033 --> 00:56.967
I either go
surrogate brown bag,

00:57.002 --> 00:58.436
or I withdraw cash

00:58.470 --> 01:00.905
from the college fund
that Sheila started in my name.

01:00.939 --> 01:02.973
I mean, you're kidding.

01:03.008 --> 01:04.375
It's a very robust account.

01:04.409 --> 01:07.211
Throws off...
(Whispers) A lot of interest.

01:07.245 --> 01:10.214
<i>It wasn't just the college fund</i>
<i>that was bothering dad.</i>

01:10.248 --> 01:11.782
Thank you, George.

01:11.817 --> 01:13.701
The neighborhood thanks you.

01:13.752 --> 01:15.619
<i>- It was Sheila Shay.</i>
- Ha!

01:15.654 --> 01:17.121
You missed a spot.

01:17.155 --> 01:20.958
<i>She said she was</i>
<i>just being "neighborly,"</i>

01:20.992 --> 01:24.011
<i>but it was pretty obvious</i>
<i>she was trying to co-parent,</i>

01:24.062 --> 01:26.564
<i>one capful at a time.</i>

01:27.999 --> 01:30.434
Get your bag.

01:30.468 --> 01:32.086
I'm driving you
to school today.

01:32.120 --> 01:34.004
Are you sure?
Because Sheila offered.

01:34.038 --> 01:35.606
Get your bag.

All hands on deck.

01:53.625 --> 01:55.125
What deck?

01:55.143 --> 01:58.629
Oh, George! Hey. I'm just doing
a little P.T.A. recruitment.

01:58.663 --> 02:00.181
We lost Joann Junebach.

02:00.232 --> 02:03.200
She was the one who was arrested
for giving her daughter Botox.

02:03.235 --> 02:04.768
She gave her daughter Botox?

02:04.802 --> 02:06.337
Anyhoo, Joann lost custody,

02:06.371 --> 02:08.372
and after that,
she really fell apart.

02:08.406 --> 02:10.473
Well, sure. I imagine,
losing your daughter...

02:10.508 --> 02:12.193
No, I'm talking about
her daughter.

02:12.244 --> 02:14.578
Without the Botox,
she fell apart.

02:14.613 --> 02:16.780

02:16.848 --> 02:18.882
I swear, the saddest thing.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.084
She got these...

02:20.118 --> 02:22.186
And then she got these...

02:22.220 --> 02:23.604
Tessa! All good on lunch?

02:23.638 --> 02:24.972
All good on lunch.

02:25.023 --> 02:27.258
Oh, all good on lunch, Sheila.
Bye, honey. (Clears throat)

02:27.292 --> 02:28.576
Bye.

02:28.627 --> 02:31.128
Look, I-I-I really appreciate
the gesture,

02:31.162 --> 02:33.130
but you don't need
to do that anymore.

02:33.148 --> 02:34.932
I've got it covered.
You can stop.

02:34.966 --> 02:36.600
It's my sincere pleasure,
George.

02:36.634 --> 02:38.202
N-no. I don't think
you understand.

02:38.236 --> 02:40.938
What I'm saying is I want you to stop.
(School bell rings)

02:40.972 --> 02:42.973
I understand what you're saying,
but I'm not gonna stop.

02:42.991 --> 02:45.209
Bye, mom.
See, as President of the P.T.A.,

02:45.243 --> 02:47.778
I see all the children
as my own.

02:47.812 --> 02:50.247
- I said bye.
- That's why each and every one of them

02:50.282 --> 02:52.199
gets my undivided attention.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.196
I'm going to class.

02:53.197 --> 02:55.786
All right! You're going to class.
Congratulations.

02:55.820 --> 02:57.671
I'll see you at pickup, honey.

02:57.706 --> 02:59.290
You know, maybe I should
join the P.T.A.

02:59.324 --> 03:00.824
Sounds... sounds like a fun way

03:00.842 --> 03:02.876
for a hands-on parent such as
myself to get involved. (Gasps)

03:02.928 --> 03:05.546
(Laughs) You in the P.T.A.?
God, no.

03:05.597 --> 03:07.665
Are you telling me
I cannot join the P.T.A.?

03:07.699 --> 03:11.168
No, I'm telling you
you shall not join the P.T.A.

03:11.186 --> 03:13.053
- I can't?
- You shan't.

03:13.104 --> 03:15.105
Oh, but I shall, Sheila.

03:15.140 --> 03:16.707
The thing is,

03:16.741 --> 03:18.142
I shall.

03:18.176 --> 03:21.378
My, this is getting
downright elizabethan.

03:21.413 --> 03:23.581
<i>The school hallway can be</i>
<i>a hostile environment,</i>

03:23.615 --> 03:25.015
<i>so I decided to take a cue</i>

03:25.050 --> 03:27.217
<i>from the giant mudskipper</i>
<i>of Borneo</i>

03:27.252 --> 03:29.920
<i>and burrow</i>
<i>in the girls' room.</i>

03:29.955 --> 03:32.439
(Knock on door)
(Mr.Wolfe) Tessa, can I come in?

03:32.474 --> 03:35.225
(Door creaks)

03:35.260 --> 03:36.760
What are you doing
in the girls' room?

03:36.795 --> 03:38.862
I could ask you the same thing.

03:38.897 --> 03:41.265
Tessa, your third period is
an elective.

03:41.299 --> 03:45.502
I know. I elect to read...
In the bathroom.

03:46.288 --> 03:51.041
There are many enriching
electives to choose from...

03:51.075 --> 03:52.509
Day trading...

03:52.544 --> 03:53.827
(Telephone rings)

03:53.862 --> 03:56.080
Flat-ironing...

03:57.265 --> 03:58.265
Drama...

03:58.300 --> 04:00.050
Because I said
that I was into him,

04:00.085 --> 04:01.919
and you both went for him
anyway.

04:01.953 --> 04:04.955
- We didn't go for him, Kimantha.
- He went for us, Kimantha.

04:04.990 --> 04:09.193
Kaitlyn, Kenzie,
you skanks are real whores.

04:09.227 --> 04:10.878
- You're a whore!
- No, you're a whore!

04:10.912 --> 04:12.229
You're a whore.

04:12.263 --> 04:14.632
Yeah, I'd like to avoid
dealing with the K.K.K.

04:14.666 --> 04:16.567
(Kaitlyn) - You're a whore!
(Kimantha) - No, you're a whore.

04:16.601 --> 04:17.834
Kenzie, Kaitlyn,
and Kimantha.

04:17.869 --> 04:19.870
- You're <i>both</i> whores.
- Okay...

04:19.904 --> 04:21.404
Tessa, I'm stumped.

04:21.439 --> 04:24.742
What kind of elective
<i>are</i> you interested in?

04:24.776 --> 04:27.911
Do you have anything unpopular
and poorly supervised?

04:27.946 --> 04:30.881
School newspaper.
But you don't want that.

04:30.915 --> 04:32.249
Don't I?

04:32.283 --> 04:34.652
(Keyboard clacking)
<i>Located in the basement,</i>

04:34.686 --> 04:36.887
<i>"the Chatswin chronicle" was</i> <i>the
perfect place...</i> (Knock on door)

04:36.921 --> 04:38.789
<i>to fly below radar.</i>
(Door squeaks)

04:38.823 --> 04:39.990
Hello?

04:40.025 --> 04:41.558
Hello.

04:41.593 --> 04:43.594
Hey. I'm Tessa.

04:45.730 --> 04:47.665
I signed up
for the school newspaper

04:47.699 --> 04:49.700
as an elective or whatever.

04:49.734 --> 04:52.202
Look, I don't know
what you're expecting,

04:52.237 --> 04:54.371
but you're gonna need
to lower your expectations.

04:54.406 --> 04:56.774
I think we're good.
I expect nothing.

04:56.808 --> 05:00.010
No one reads
"the Chatswin chronicle."

05:01.413 --> 05:04.381
<i>They line the hamster cage</i>
<i>with it in the science lab.</i>

05:04.416 --> 05:06.116
<i>They clean up vomit with it</i>
<i>in the cafeteria.</i>

05:06.151 --> 05:07.785
<i>I'm told they use</i>
<i>three copies</i>

05:07.819 --> 05:09.353
<i>to steady a table leg</i>
<i>in the teachers' lounge.</i>

05:09.387 --> 05:11.221
I think that hurts the most.

05:11.256 --> 05:14.324
So if no one reads it,
why do you publish it?

05:14.359 --> 05:16.293
Um, because I believe?

05:16.327 --> 05:18.929
That's why I dedicate
all my free time to the paper.

05:18.963 --> 05:20.431
Except Wednesday nights.

05:20.465 --> 05:22.199
What's Wednesday nights?

05:22.233 --> 05:24.101
That's when
the "medium" fan club meets

05:24.135 --> 05:26.470
to re-enact scenes
from the TV show "medium."

05:33.645 --> 05:36.380
<i>If the school paper</i>
<i>wasn't already unpopular,</i>

05:36.414 --> 05:39.183
<i>this kid's name on the masthead</i>
<i>wasn't gonna help.</i>

05:40.452 --> 05:41.919
(Chuckles)

05:41.953 --> 05:43.954
Ladies, I would like
to introduce everyone

05:43.988 --> 05:47.074
to our newest and only member
with a member...

05:47.108 --> 05:48.625
(Laughter)
(Chuckles) George Altman.

05:48.660 --> 05:50.260
Oh, wow. Okay.
(Applause)

05:50.295 --> 05:53.147
Well, I-I-I promise not to hold
my membership against you.

05:53.198 --> 05:54.531
Oh! (Laughs)
(Laughter)

05:54.566 --> 05:56.049
All right,
can we settle, please?

05:56.101 --> 05:57.367
Can we focus up and settle?

05:57.402 --> 06:00.921
Can I have all eyes up here,
please, and settle?

06:00.972 --> 06:03.140
First order of business...

06:03.174 --> 06:07.060
Ah! Has Tessa Altman
had all of her shots?

06:07.095 --> 06:11.615
Is she up to date
on her immunizations?

06:11.649 --> 06:12.883
You're kidding me.

06:12.917 --> 06:15.752
Well, we know that you tend
to be a little busy.

06:15.770 --> 06:18.038
Okay, you know what?

06:18.072 --> 06:20.457
I may not mother the way
you mothers mother,

06:20.492 --> 06:24.394
but I am a caring
and responsible parent.

06:24.429 --> 06:26.530
And, yes, I also happen
to be a working parent.

06:26.564 --> 06:28.649
In case you've never met one
before, hello. How do you do?

06:28.700 --> 06:29.983
How do you do?

06:30.018 --> 06:32.236
And working parents
sometimes forget things,

06:32.270 --> 06:33.687
and sometimes they run late,

06:33.738 --> 06:36.340
but that is because we are
juggling more than you.

06:36.374 --> 06:38.509
(Women gasp)
George.

06:38.543 --> 06:40.944
How dare you.
We work very hard.

06:40.979 --> 06:43.380
With all due respect,
the P.T.A. is not a job.

06:43.414 --> 06:44.915
It's a club.

06:44.949 --> 06:47.050
(Women gasp) And certain
club members need to realize

06:47.085 --> 06:50.954
that life isn't all
lemon bars and lemonade.

06:50.989 --> 06:52.539
(Crunches)

06:52.590 --> 06:55.058
Although
these are top-notch.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.564
Also,
the lemonade is very good.

07:00.598 --> 07:02.549
You are out of order,
George.

07:02.584 --> 07:03.867
What's the matter, Sheila?

07:03.902 --> 07:06.203
Not enjoying my unsolicited opinions
and overbearing presence?

07:06.237 --> 07:08.138
All right, you know what?
That's it! I am gaveling you!

07:08.173 --> 07:09.706
You are being gaveled!

07:09.724 --> 07:12.593
You're gaveling me? Maybe it's
time somebody gaveled <i>you.</i>

07:12.644 --> 07:13.944
(Woman gasps)
Oh. Oh.

07:13.978 --> 07:15.879
The P.T.A. has not
been this exciting

07:15.897 --> 07:18.882
since Konnie Kushell
had her psychotic break.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.434
Ooh, which one's Konnie?

07:20.485 --> 07:21.785
Right here.

07:25.034 --> 07:26.534
So you're gonna
drop out, right?

07:26.568 --> 07:28.869
No. No. If I quit
the P.T.A. now, Sheila wins.

07:29.777 --> 07:31.911
I just don't understand it.
Women usually like me.

07:31.962 --> 07:35.048
George,
cucumber-infused washcloth?

07:35.099 --> 07:37.350
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, you are.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.788
Seriously, though, man,

07:41.822 --> 07:43.706
what do you think
I should do?

07:43.740 --> 07:45.875
Well, if I were you,
I'd ask her out.

07:45.909 --> 07:47.927
What? Sheila?

07:47.978 --> 07:51.698
No. Jocelyn the washcloth girl.
Man, what is wrong with you?

07:51.749 --> 07:53.616
You are so obsessed
with M.I.L.F.S,

07:53.650 --> 07:55.935
that you don't even notice
the I.L.F.S.

07:57.938 --> 07:59.922
<i>Malik needed</i>
<i>some honest feedback,</i>

07:59.940 --> 08:02.108
<i>and honestly,</i>
<i>"the Chatswin chronicle"</i>

08:02.142 --> 08:04.660

08:04.695 --> 08:07.447
And I see you spent

08:07.498 --> 08:08.965

08:08.999 --> 08:10.366
Hey, I broke
"no more fish tacos"

08:10.401 --> 08:13.052
a full week
before the announcement.

08:13.087 --> 08:14.570
Cool.

08:14.605 --> 08:16.055
I know. And still, no one reads
"the Chatswin chronicle."

08:16.106 --> 08:18.241
"Chronicle's"
not even a word.

08:18.275 --> 08:20.276
It is a word.

08:20.310 --> 08:22.445
"Chronicle" sounds like
something on the side of a boat.

08:22.479 --> 08:24.247
You mean "barnacle"?

08:24.281 --> 08:26.249
Maybe we should change
the name of the paper.

08:26.283 --> 08:28.601
It's obviously
confusing some people.

08:28.635 --> 08:30.886
Yeah, and also, it's boring.

08:30.904 --> 08:32.905
But, you guys, seriously,
you know who has fat knees?

08:32.956 --> 08:36.491
Hannah Mccleary. And it's weird
because the rest of her is thin.

08:36.510 --> 08:39.395
Malik, that's the kind of stuff
these people care about,

08:39.429 --> 08:40.929
not word jumbles.

08:40.964 --> 08:42.198
But it's a newspaper.

08:42.232 --> 08:44.667
Well, it was news to me
when I saw her fat knees.

08:44.701 --> 08:46.069
Don't you see?

08:46.103 --> 08:48.071
The reason these kids
aren't reading your paper

08:48.105 --> 08:49.405
is because most of them are

08:49.440 --> 08:53.810
gossipy, superficial,
mean-spirited materialists,

08:53.844 --> 08:55.912
like Dalia.

08:55.946 --> 08:58.281
Yeah. And you know what else?

08:58.315 --> 09:00.466
I heard Terry Garsen
from Boys' Lacrosse

09:00.501 --> 09:03.252
lost his virginity
to Stacy Unger from cheer,

09:03.287 --> 09:05.388
and I know for a fact...

09:05.422 --> 09:07.857
- She has cellulite.
- There you have it.

09:07.875 --> 09:10.059
So you're saying if I want
people to read my paper,

09:10.094 --> 09:12.261
all I have to do is trash
the kids we go to school with?

09:12.296 --> 09:14.644
And I understand why you
might not want to do that...

09:14.645 --> 09:15.831
I'm in!

09:17.751 --> 09:19.836
<i>Since I was forced</i>
<i>to take an elective,</i>

09:19.870 --> 09:21.437
<i>i elected to help.</i>

09:21.472 --> 09:23.122
We can call it
"the Chatswin chatterer."

09:23.173 --> 09:25.675
"Chatterer" is not a word.

09:25.709 --> 09:27.042
I mean...

09:27.060 --> 09:29.011
It is.

09:30.514 --> 09:32.115
(Grunts)

09:32.149 --> 09:33.616
(Beep)
104.

09:33.634 --> 09:36.519
George!
Oh, I'll be right back, hon.

09:36.553 --> 09:37.570
George!

09:37.604 --> 09:39.188
- George, hey!
- Hey.

09:39.223 --> 09:40.623
I'm glad I caught you.

09:40.657 --> 09:42.208
I want to talk to you
about something

09:42.242 --> 09:46.045
that may be none of my business,
but also kinda is.

09:46.079 --> 09:48.131
You need to drop out
of the P.T.A.

09:48.165 --> 09:49.498
What? Why?

09:49.516 --> 09:51.467
Today's meeting was
a total disaster,

09:51.501 --> 09:53.269
in case you didn't notice.

09:53.303 --> 09:55.521
You offended just about
every one of those women.

09:55.556 --> 09:57.156
Yeah, well,
they offended me.

09:57.207 --> 09:59.108
Individually,
they're harmless,

09:59.143 --> 10:02.345
but when they work together,
they can be a real bitch.

10:02.379 --> 10:05.331
I'm not gonna just disappear
because Sheila doesn't like me.

10:05.365 --> 10:08.417
George, these women
are pack animals.

10:08.452 --> 10:09.919
Hey, Beth.

10:09.953 --> 10:13.256
And like it or not, you're never
gonna be a part of their pack.

10:13.290 --> 10:14.790
Well, that's fine, but I'm not
quitting the P.T.A.

10:14.808 --> 10:16.559
Those women are judging me,

10:16.593 --> 10:18.928
and I have just as much right
to be there as they do.

10:18.962 --> 10:21.280
Well, I suspect Sheila is gonna
do everything in her power

10:21.315 --> 10:23.082
to make you feel otherwise.

10:23.116 --> 10:25.568
Oh? Oh, really? Well, let me
assure you of one thing, Dallas.

10:25.602 --> 10:27.370
In the... in the fight
between, uh,

10:27.404 --> 10:29.639
Sheila Shay
and George Altman,

10:29.673 --> 10:31.457
it's gonna be Altman.

10:34.044 --> 10:37.747
You can't take those towels
off the property!

10:37.781 --> 10:39.031
<i>The next day,</i>

10:39.082 --> 10:41.200

11:15.969 --> 11:18.220
Great party.

11:18.255 --> 11:21.423
I can't believe he had
the nerve to show up.

11:21.474 --> 11:23.976
Okay, plan "B." Let's go.

11:25.412 --> 11:27.296

Tonight we are united as moms.

11:30.750 --> 11:31.934
Hear, hear.

11:31.968 --> 11:34.303
And as moms,
we all know the stress

11:34.354 --> 11:35.554
that carrying a child

11:35.589 --> 11:39.058
can place on our <i>chi</i>

11:39.092 --> 11:41.343
(Laughter)
So tonight's activity

11:41.394 --> 11:43.295

That's the problem.

13:07.063 --> 13:09.264
Men need to be needed.

13:09.299 --> 13:11.850
- Your husband feels...
- Emasculated?

13:11.868 --> 13:13.519
- Definitely.
- Marginalized?

13:13.553 --> 13:14.954
- No question.
- Impotent?

13:14.988 --> 13:16.922
I'm not a doctor, but look,

13:16.940 --> 13:18.891
if you want him to want you,

13:18.925 --> 13:22.328
just let him come to the rescue
every now and then.

talking about my situation.

13:44.917 --> 13:46.485
One at a time, ladies.
Don't grab.

13:46.519 --> 13:49.421
So wait. You joined the P.T.A.
so that you could

13:49.456 --> 13:51.490
put a self-righteous mom
in her place,

13:51.524 --> 13:55.511
and now you are the head of the
self-righteous moms? (Cell phone ringing)

Are you coming
to the pep rally, Malik?

14:21.587 --> 14:23.222

a back handspring.

14:23.256 --> 14:24.523

Hi, Tessa. I made you
a rice krispie treat.

14:34.968 --> 14:37.836

I'm about to go pee.

14:57.006 --> 15:00.142
Lisa Shay...
she's a thumb-sucker.

15:02.328 --> 15:03.562
Dalia says she goes
to nonfiction

15:03.596 --> 15:05.064
during study hall to do it.

15:05.098 --> 15:08.067
Oh, my God! What was Dalia
doing in nonfiction?

15:08.101 --> 15:10.769
Who cares? Front page
of "the Chatterer," bitches!

15:10.804 --> 15:12.404
Malik,
we can't run this story.

15:12.439 --> 15:13.872
It's messed up.

15:13.907 --> 15:15.140
Yeah, well, everything
we publish is messed up,

15:15.175 --> 15:16.975
and that was your idea,

15:17.010 --> 15:18.653
and now the paper's a huge hit.
<i>Ba-nay-nay. </i>

15:18.654 --> 15:19.711
Why do you keep saying that?

15:19.746 --> 15:21.587
It's my new catchphrase.
You don't like it?

15:21.588 --> 15:22.047
I hate it.

15:22.082 --> 15:25.517
Well, I could try
<i>banizz-nas...</i> instead.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.954
Stick with <i>ba-nay-nay.</i>

15:31.991 --> 15:34.860
Okay, first order of business...

15:34.894 --> 15:36.628
Uh, Rhonda.

15:36.663 --> 15:40.182
My husband says he doesn't want
to go out because he's tired,

15:40.216 --> 15:43.802
but then he spends the whole
night awake watching ESPN.

15:43.837 --> 15:46.071
Oh, what he means is he's tired
of doing what you want to do.

15:46.105 --> 15:47.573
And in the past, have you tried

15:47.607 --> 15:49.591
engaging in hobbies
that he enjoys?

15:49.626 --> 15:53.078
Mm-hmm. I've tried, but I don't
like Internet pornography.

15:53.113 --> 15:56.248
George, Teacher Appreciation Day
is on Monday,

15:56.282 --> 15:58.083
and we still haven't decided

15:58.118 --> 16:00.886
on how we plan to show
our gratitude to the faculty.

16:00.904 --> 16:03.272
Right. I think we should do it
by saying "thank you."

16:03.323 --> 16:04.823
- With?
- Our mouths.

16:04.858 --> 16:06.441
- And also?
- Hand gestures?

16:06.493 --> 16:07.893
(Whispers)
Individual rose bouquets.

16:07.911 --> 16:09.728
Yes, of course,
individual rose bouquets.

16:09.762 --> 16:11.246
Um, now in the past,

16:11.281 --> 16:13.582
Sheila has harvested the rose
bouquets from her garden.

16:13.616 --> 16:14.867
Perfect.

16:14.901 --> 16:17.369
<i>Ah.</i> Sheila's no longer
with us.

16:17.403 --> 16:20.255
Right. Okay. So who wants
to do the rose bouquets?

16:20.290 --> 16:22.374
<i>(Birds chirping)</i>

16:22.408 --> 16:24.309
Nobody? Okay, fine.
I'll do it.

16:24.344 --> 16:26.111
Um, but you're doing
the refreshments.

16:26.146 --> 16:29.014
Well, I'll do the refreshments
<i>and</i> the rose bouquets.

16:29.048 --> 16:31.133
But you still need
to finish my skylight.

16:31.184 --> 16:33.218
<i>George was quick learning</i>
<i>that life with the mothers</i>

16:33.252 --> 16:35.487

16:50.522 --> 16:51.689
What?

16:51.723 --> 16:53.724
Oh, just something
I'm working on.

16:56.862 --> 16:59.764
What are you doing?
I thought we were friends.

16:59.798 --> 17:01.299
I thought we were, too,

17:01.333 --> 17:02.967
but I also thought we were
friends with Lisa Shay.

17:03.001 --> 17:05.502
Why did you think we were
friends with Lisa Shay?

17:05.537 --> 17:07.338
Because I live
across the street from her.

17:07.372 --> 17:09.339
Guess what. I don't.

17:09.374 --> 17:11.224
Look what's happened to you.

17:11.260 --> 17:13.042
You used to have
journalistic integrity.

17:13.060 --> 17:17.647
I mean, you were the reporter
who broke "no more fish tacos,"

17:17.683 --> 17:19.550
and now you' going to rallies
with the K.K.K.

17:19.585 --> 17:21.886
- The K.K.K.?
- Kenzie, Kaitlyn, and Kimantha.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.422
The old Malik never would've
hung out with those girls.

17:24.455 --> 17:26.156
Yeah, the old Malik
never would've been invited

17:26.191 --> 17:27.289
to hang out with those girls.

17:27.290 --> 17:28.894
I like the new Malik.
He's ballin'.

17:28.895 --> 17:31.696
Well, I like the old Malik
because he wasn't ballin'.

17:31.730 --> 17:34.365
He was just a nice guy...
I think.

17:34.399 --> 17:38.536
Honestly, I haven't spent that
much time with the old Malik

17:38.570 --> 17:40.538
but I wanted to.

17:40.572 --> 17:42.440
Really? You wanted to?

17:42.474 --> 17:43.541
(Knock on door)

17:43.575 --> 17:45.877
I finished
last week's word jumble.

17:45.911 --> 17:49.146
It says I get a free milk.

17:53.585 --> 17:55.186
Thanks.

17:55.220 --> 17:56.921
Hey, just a heads-up,

17:56.955 --> 17:59.140
some people really care about
"the Chatswin chronicle,"

17:59.191 --> 18:01.359
and they started a petition
to get it back.

18:01.393 --> 18:03.978
I only have two signatures
so far,

18:04.029 --> 18:06.364
and... they're both mine.

18:08.467 --> 18:11.068
We're expecting a few more.

18:11.103 --> 18:13.971
<i>Lisa's petition got</i>
<i>two more signatures that day.</i>

18:14.006 --> 18:17.475
<i>It turned out those were</i>
<i>the only two she needed,</i>

18:17.509 --> 18:19.944
<i>and with "the Chatswin</i>
<i>chronicle"</i> <i>restored,</i>

18:19.978 --> 18:22.914
<i>it was time to focus my efforts</i>
<i>on dad.</i>

18:22.948 --> 18:24.448
We're out of juice,

18:24.466 --> 18:26.817
and we've been out of juice
for, like, a week.

18:26.852 --> 18:28.586
<i>He had stopped hunting</i>
<i>and gathering.</i>

18:28.620 --> 18:29.971
I'm sorry, honey.

18:30.005 --> 18:32.890
The P.T.A. thing...
It's consuming all of my time.

18:32.925 --> 18:34.425
And all of our bread,
apparently,

18:34.459 --> 18:36.143
because we are out
of that, too.

18:36.178 --> 18:39.330
Oh. Us moms had this duck
charity thing down at the pond.

18:39.364 --> 18:41.766
The baby mallards
are <i>beyond</i> cute.

18:41.800 --> 18:45.269
We are spiraling out of control
here, George.

18:45.304 --> 18:46.737
You're talking
about baby ducks

18:46.772 --> 18:48.506
and spending all your time
with middle-aged women.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.942
What?

18:50.976 --> 18:53.644
Don't you think it's time
you hung up those mom jeans

18:53.679 --> 18:56.146
and went back to being a dad?

18:56.164 --> 18:58.032
These aren't mom jeans. I've got them
from a garrage sell.

18:58.083 --> 19:00.117
Yeah, but whose garage sale,
George?

19:00.152 --> 19:01.836
<i>Whose</i> garage sale?

19:01.870 --> 19:05.056
Rhonda's. I got them
at Rhonda's garage...

19:06.491 --> 19:08.759
I'm wearing Rhonda's jeans.

19:08.794 --> 19:10.328

19:21.690 --> 19:23.173
I beg your pardon.

19:23.191 --> 19:25.026
I'm sorry, Sheila.
You were right.

19:25.060 --> 19:27.745
The P.T.A. is not for me,
so go on, please.

19:27.779 --> 19:29.880
I'm not sure I want it,
George.

19:29.915 --> 19:32.817
I have rather been enjoying
my free time.

19:32.851 --> 19:34.318
I've been working
on my suntan.

19:34.352 --> 19:36.020
I have read
"the lovely bones."

19:36.054 --> 19:40.424
Why, just yesterday,
I tried <i>black cherry soda.</i>

19:40.459 --> 19:42.226
Oh, well, that is
a delicious flavor of soda,

19:42.260 --> 19:44.862
but seriously, Sheila,

19:44.896 --> 19:47.098
I can't give these women
what they need.

19:47.132 --> 19:49.300
You have to come back.

19:49.334 --> 19:52.386
I don't have it in me.
Not anymore.

19:52.421 --> 19:53.904
Fine.

19:53.939 --> 19:55.906
Well, I hope
at the very least,

19:55.941 --> 19:58.743
you'll attend our P.T.A. picnic
at Redmond field.

19:58.777 --> 20:01.245
Redmond field? That's right
next to the petrol station.

20:01.279 --> 20:02.680
Think of the fumes!

20:02.714 --> 20:04.732
See, that's just the thing.

20:04.766 --> 20:07.885
Sheila, I-I-I-I didn't think
of the fumes.

20:07.919 --> 20:09.387
(Scoffs)
You did.

20:09.421 --> 20:12.523
You always think
of the fumes.

20:16.061 --> 20:19.797
Visit adjourned.

20:19.831 --> 20:23.868
Oh, and, George, you wear
the hell out of those jeans.

20:23.902 --> 20:26.837
(Chuckles)

20:29.741 --> 20:32.176
All right, I'm leaving
for work in five.

20:32.210 --> 20:34.178
You want me to pack you
a lunch today,

20:34.212 --> 20:35.613
or are you gonna buy
something at school?

20:35.647 --> 20:37.581
Oh, it says here the special
is beef Stroganoff.

20:37.616 --> 20:39.116
I know.

20:39.151 --> 20:42.353
I helped break that story.

20:42.387 --> 20:47.308
(Laughs) Wow. Princeton's
gonna be really impressed.

20:47.342 --> 20:49.427
Mm.

20:49.461 --> 20:51.228
I'm not going to college.

20:53.465 --> 20:54.865
(Chuckles)

20:54.900 --> 20:56.701
Yeah, you are.

20:56.735 --> 20:59.036
(Laughs)

20:59.071 --> 21:02.373
No, seriously.
I-I decided I'm not going.
