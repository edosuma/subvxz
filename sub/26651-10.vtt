East Berlin, East Germany

00:21.720 --> 00:22.520
Excuse me...

00:22.600 --> 00:23.840
Do you have a light?

00:31.520 --> 00:33.520
The HVA just made a deal.

00:35.560 --> 00:38.920
Submarine parts are being smuggled
to the SADF in a cruise ship.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.440
Around the UN sanctions.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.440
They call it "Operation Love Boat."

00:43.080 --> 00:44.800
Lenora is deeply involved.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.360
I have proof.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.840
Will you be able to bring her in tomorrow?

00:50.320 --> 00:52.120
You do want her alive, don't you?

00:53.840 --> 00:54.640
I'm joking.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.640
Consider it done.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.360
Meet me at Tucholskystrasse
tomorrow at 10.00 p.m.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.960
Right next to the US Embassy.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.560
I'll arrange passage into the West
for the three of you.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.560
The boy is also coming,

01:11.720 --> 01:12.560
isn't he?

01:12.640 --> 01:13.480
Yes.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.840
Tell Brigitte Winkelmann
everything will go as planned.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.160
(English) - What do you think?
-Exciting stuff.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.200
Right?
Everyone loves Rocky Horror!

02:13.600 --> 02:18.760
We dress up, get the audience involved,
show what freedom feels like.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.600
-I... I don't know.
-Come on.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.600
You would be a great Brad.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.520
And I'll be Janet.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.440
It'll be fun.

02:35.440 --> 02:40.440
-Why not West Side Story?
-Rocky Horror gets everyone involved.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.960
(The door opens)
Comrades, I have bad news.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.840
Operation Love Boat

03:13.920 --> 03:15.400
has been sunk.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.160
(Echoing thump)

03:17.240 --> 03:20.360
"These pictures will be sent
to the West German press immediately

03:20.520 --> 03:22.800
if you don't turn the ship around."

03:24.240 --> 03:26.680
The boat is currently
in international waters

03:26.960 --> 03:28.680
off the coast of the Netherlands.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.880
The passengers have no idea
about any of this shit.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.720
We have no choice
but to bring the boat back.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.960
No.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.000
(Booming, distant bass)

03:37.080 --> 03:40.160
We still owe 30 million DM
for the bloody ship.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.280
If the sub parts don't reach South Africa,
we don't get paid.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.280
Money isn't the only thing at stake here.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.080
Oh, yes? What else is?

03:47.160 --> 03:49.960
-Barbara.
-This isn't a popularity contest.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.680
Since when did we care
what the West Germans think about us?

03:54.120 --> 03:55.560
What do we have to lose?

03:56.160 --> 03:57.320
Our good reputation?

03:58.520 --> 04:00.920
The lying western press
will soon lose interest in this.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
-But our creditors won't.
-I think you're right.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.480
We shouldn't let ourselves
be steered off course.

04:06.640 --> 04:07.680
A-ha?

04:07.760 --> 04:11.640
And what do you think the legal
repercussions will be if this comes out?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.600
We're a member of the UN

04:13.680 --> 04:14.680
and this deal

04:15.080 --> 04:17.640
is a clear violation of the UN embargo.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.560
The legal repercussions
are irrelevant at the moment.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.840
It'll take five years
before this comes to court.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.080
And who knows
if we'll still exist in five years?

04:27.840 --> 04:31.080
We're in the greatest economic crisis
in the history of East Germany.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.280
We deliver the goods,

04:33.760 --> 04:34.960
we get the money.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.080
Then we pay off the next installment
of our international debts.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.520
-It's still my call.
-I have to tell you once again.

04:41.680 --> 04:45.640
We stand to lose 30 million DM
if we turn that ship around.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.880
I'll make a decision by the end of today.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.760
In the meantime,
find out who wrote the letter.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.520

04:55.240 --> 04:57.560
West Berlin, West Germany

04:57.640 --> 05:00.080
Shouldn't we give the photos
to Spiegel Magazine?

05:00.160 --> 05:01.240
Not yet.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.240
We can still do that
if our threat isn't enough.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.000
But it would be a huge chance.

05:07.080 --> 05:07.960
Professor Tischbier,

05:09.040 --> 05:11.720
what will you do
to get my girls out of there?

05:11.880 --> 05:14.080
The Federal Ministry
has people on the ground.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.840
They will find your family.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.200
When?

05:18.440 --> 05:19.400
Tina.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.720
These things take time.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.840
It's already taken too long!

05:22.920 --> 05:24.560
(Rising ambient tones)

05:25.040 --> 05:27.240
When I think about my husband in jail,

05:28.160 --> 05:29.480
or about Marianne...

05:31.440 --> 05:34.760
Every moment
my girls are alone out there, without us,

05:35.880 --> 05:38.120
it feels like my heart
is being ripped out.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.600
Please.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.280
You have no idea how brutal they can be.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.160
WE KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE INVOLVED IN

06:18.000 --> 06:20.520
Let's leave for Austria tonight.
I booked flights to Vienna.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.040
I'm not going anywhere tonight.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.560
What do you mean?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.400
I just need more time.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.080
Alone.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.480
We've been apart all spring.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.000
I was by myself in Cape Town
for two months.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.520
I had to help my mother.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.200
But I need you now.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.840
This isn't about you.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.720
It's about me.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.800
We should have had children.

06:58.440 --> 06:59.440
What?

07:04.880 --> 07:06.320
If we'd had children...

07:10.320 --> 07:11.520
It's over, Frank.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.280
I don't love you anymore.

08:32.280 --> 08:36.880
On the wall, on the lookout
Sits a little bug

08:37.760 --> 08:38.640
There.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.080
Look, Mama.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.280
Aren't you a real snail expert, darling!

08:47.400 --> 08:48.680
So sticky.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.280
Come on, let's go.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.000
(Boy pants excitedly)

08:53.360 --> 08:54.800
I bet you're hungry.

On the wall, on the lookout

09:05.840 --> 09:07.760
(Bubbling)

09:23.920 --> 09:26.720
WHERE ARE TINA'S CHILDREN?
THEY DID NOT ARRIVE!

09:27.200 --> 09:28.280
(Door closing)

09:28.360 --> 09:29.160
Hi, Mama.

09:30.120 --> 09:30.920
Hey.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.760
You're just in time,
lunch is almost ready.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.360
Ah, I'm really hungry.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.320
(Music fades, he sighs)

09:40.600 --> 09:41.440
Say...

09:41.720 --> 09:43.680
have you ever taken Max into the city?

09:45.520 --> 09:47.240
He's still a little young for museums.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.600
But he likes to ride the S-Bahn.
And trains.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.440
-He does?
-Oh yes. He loves trains.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.120
Just like you used to.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.520
(They laugh)

09:55.760 --> 09:56.560
Why?

09:56.760 --> 09:59.200
I've just been thinking about things
we can do together.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.160
Did you make plans with Annett?

10:01.400 --> 10:05.480
To be honest, she made it pretty clear
that she wants to keep Max away from me.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.040
She said it like that?

10:09.440 --> 10:10.960
Well, between the lines, yes.

10:13.880 --> 10:14.680
Well.

10:15.720 --> 10:19.120
You have to give her time
to get used to the idea of you.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.480
She's been raising that boy alone
from the start.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.840
You'll have to be a little patient.

10:28.280 --> 10:29.400
Yes, maybe.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.520
At the orphanage I worked at in Angola...

10:37.800 --> 10:39.000
there was a boy.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.560
He was smaller than the others.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.640
We were close and I took care of him.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.440
But when I got the chance to come home,

10:51.200 --> 10:52.600
I just left him.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.880
I keep thinking about him.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.080
Now he's down there and I'm here.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.920
Hm, and Annett won't even let me see Max.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.040
I'm beginning to wonder
if I made a terrible mistake.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.080
That's the worst thing.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.320
Hm?

11:18.400 --> 11:20.520
When parents are separated
from their children.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.560
Do you remember Tina, Thomas' sister?

11:29.280 --> 11:30.200
Yes, of course.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.400
Hm.

11:31.760 --> 11:32.920
She was in jail.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.800
Was bought out of East Germany
by the West,

11:36.400 --> 11:38.160
but they refused to release the children.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.600
Oh.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.360
And where are they now?

11:46.080 --> 11:46.920
I don't know.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.840
(A car approaches)

11:52.760 --> 11:55.680
The captain read me
the entire passenger manifest.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.040
Rose's name wasn't on it.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.520
She must be traveling incognito.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.440
I described her to the captain.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.600
(Bass and keyboard set in)

12:02.760 --> 12:03.760
He said...

12:05.680 --> 12:07.600
there was no one like her on board.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.280
You mean no one who...

12:10.920 --> 12:12.720
-Yes.
-Okay.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.080
It's not like she's easy to overlook.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.400
(Guitar notes set in)

12:19.480 --> 12:21.000
So where did she go?

12:21.080 --> 12:24.000
Could Rose have gone to the western press,
after swimming ashore?

12:27.280 --> 12:30.640
I spoke with our surveillance team
at Hotel Panorama.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.000
The night before the boat set sail,

12:33.080 --> 12:35.880
the hotel switchboard
put through a call to West Berlin.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.040
Could we trace the call?

12:38.120 --> 12:39.000
Yes.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.120
It came from Fuchs' hotel room.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.520
And... was it recorded?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.000
Unfortunately, no.

12:45.640 --> 12:46.960
It was a secure line.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.280
-You asked to see me, Comrade Fuchs?
-Sit down.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.760
(Cabinet shuts, music fades)

12:51.840 --> 12:53.000
I'd rather stand.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.040
As you wish.

12:55.840 --> 12:59.160
A series of unfortunate events
has come to my attention, Comrade Rauch.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.440
At first glance seemingly disconnected.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.360
But the signs keep pointing to you.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.440
To me?

13:06.760 --> 13:08.480
Whether it was you or Rose

13:09.320 --> 13:13.520
who made the phone call to West Berlin
from my hotel room in Rostock

13:13.600 --> 13:14.800
is completely irrelevant.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.320
Phone call? We didn't make a...

13:16.760 --> 13:18.480
Someone made a call!

13:19.320 --> 13:21.000
And I know it wasn't me!

13:21.720 --> 13:22.800
And this threat

13:23.440 --> 13:25.920
to publish our deals
in the western press...

13:26.240 --> 13:27.880
(Ambient noise fades)

13:28.120 --> 13:29.200
You two,

13:29.880 --> 13:32.400
as well as myself and Comrade Dietrich,

13:32.840 --> 13:35.480
were the only ones in Rostock
who knew about the deal.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.160
Your accusation is preposterous.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.480
I'm the one who set
the deal up in the first place.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.360
Why would I of all people...

13:43.440 --> 13:45.080
I have a sneaking suspicion

13:45.160 --> 13:46.840
that you're not coming to terms

13:46.920 --> 13:48.640
with the current state of affairs,
Comrade.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.400
And I suspect that
your loyalty to the ANC,

13:51.720 --> 13:52.960
or perhaps to Rose,

13:53.040 --> 13:55.080
is stronger than your loyalty to us!

13:55.160 --> 13:57.200
Comrade Fuchs, do you know what I suspect?

13:58.360 --> 13:59.400
I suspect that you

13:59.480 --> 14:02.240
and our state
have gone off course.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.120
On that front,

14:07.280 --> 14:09.440
I ordered the ship back to Rostock.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.640
What?

14:10.720 --> 14:13.280
We don't want the weapons
getting confiscated.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.200
Neither do our distinguished workers.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.120
By the way,

14:16.280 --> 14:17.720
Rose Seithathi has disappeared.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.880
(Booming bass returns)

14:19.120 --> 14:20.600
Rose isn't on the ship anymore?

14:20.800 --> 14:21.720
Comrade Rauch...

14:22.720 --> 14:25.200
from here on, you will be quiet.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.600
(High-pitched tone)

14:26.680 --> 14:29.800
I'm removing you from field service
effective immediately.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.520
And I'm withdrawing
your special travel permit.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.120
(Distant keyboard melody)

14:50.560 --> 14:52.960
(A door opening, closing)

14:56.760 --> 14:58.560
(Approaching footfall)

15:12.800 --> 15:14.040
Long time no see.

15:15.880 --> 15:16.680
Yes.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.200
You look good.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.320
Good for a dead guy,
is that what you mean?

15:39.280 --> 15:42.200
I only learned two weeks ago
that you survived.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.480
Hm.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.760
And I couldn't really believe it.

15:48.800 --> 15:49.840
Until now.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.320
I was so sure you were dead.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.600
Yes. I noticed.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.920
I saw you run away in Angola.

16:02.560 --> 16:03.720
Where's Ingrid?

16:04.440 --> 16:05.280
Asleep.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.320
(Cacophonous piano notes)

16:12.640 --> 16:14.080
She's sleeping, Lenora.

16:14.680 --> 16:15.520
Sorry.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.920
Do you know who saved me?

16:19.320 --> 16:20.600
Gary Banks, of all people.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.280
Gary Banks is really dead.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.160
Shot.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.440
And how do you know that?

16:25.920 --> 16:28.080
I saw it. At the Rostock docks.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.480
Maybe it was Rose.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.400
Fuchs says Rose isn't on the cruise ship.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.120
I have no idea where she might be.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.160
And I can't look for her.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.600
Anything might have happened.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.600
The South African government
has mercenaries everywhere

16:44.680 --> 16:46.120
to hunt down ANC operatives.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.600
Sorry.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.840
I'm a little drunk.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.600
(Sighs)

16:53.680 --> 16:54.560
(Cacophonous piano notes)

16:57.760 --> 16:59.720
And now Fuchs is ordering the ship back

17:00.320 --> 17:02.720
and blaming me for the whole fiasco.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.360
What fiasco?

17:04.520 --> 17:07.400
Someone found out that East Germany
is arranging weapons deals

17:07.480 --> 17:09.440
between West Germany and South Africa.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.960
They're threatening to go to the press,
and Fuchs thinks that

17:13.440 --> 17:17.280
I made a phone call and informed someone.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.040
(Laughs)

17:19.800 --> 17:20.880
(Sighs histrionically)

17:22.160 --> 17:23.240
Maybe it was you.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.040
(Violin bowing)

17:25.200 --> 17:26.240
The phone call.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.640
Fuchs took away my travel permit.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.280
And I already have a return ticket
to Cape Town.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.600
Why...

17:38.120 --> 17:40.320
would I rat out my own deal?

17:40.920 --> 17:41.760
Why?

17:43.160 --> 17:45.960
I had something
completely different in mind.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.520
Aha. Namely?

17:51.680 --> 17:54.400
The cruise ship's cargo,
the submarine parts for the SADF,

17:54.480 --> 17:56.960
were to be intercepted
by the ANC in Angola.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.240
Or that was my plan.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.960
What? You wanted to sabotage the deal?

18:02.800 --> 18:03.720
You?

18:04.520 --> 18:06.320
(Distant, thunderous bass)

18:07.000 --> 18:08.640
I never would have thought...

18:08.720 --> 18:11.320
Well, that doesn't help me now, either.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.560
Now I'm stuck here.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.240
In this doomed country.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.400
What if I could get you over the border?

18:27.240 --> 18:28.720
What would you do for that?

18:29.840 --> 18:31.520
(Storm-like keyboard tones)

18:33.000 --> 18:33.880
Anything.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.240
Kleinmachnow, East Germany

18:35.320 --> 18:36.360
(Electronic hiss, synth music)

18:42.040 --> 18:43.080
And now?

18:43.200 --> 18:46.640
Now you have to get your hands dirty
one last time.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.680
(Music grows more thunderous)

18:58.880 --> 19:00.400
(Music fades to an insistent hiss)

19:14.280 --> 19:15.440
(Crashing, tense synth tones)

19:36.120 --> 19:37.480
(Music fades)

19:43.040 --> 19:45.520
(Two-stroke engine, percussion tones)

19:51.440 --> 19:53.360
(Ambient synth)

19:56.080 --> 19:57.240
Max?

19:58.080 --> 19:59.320
(Echoing creak)

19:59.400 --> 20:00.400
Max?

20:02.400 --> 20:04.280
(Thunderous, then calm synth)

20:08.400 --> 20:10.280
(Music fades, birdsong)

20:23.120 --> 20:24.000
Hey, Max.

20:24.760 --> 20:25.720
Good morning.

20:29.960 --> 20:30.760
Don't worry.

20:30.840 --> 20:31.840
I'm your dad.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.960
I'd suspected Martin is only here
because of Max.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.720
But that he wanted to kidnap him...

20:43.320 --> 20:44.360
With your help?

20:44.640 --> 20:47.360
Well, he is his father, after all.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.200
This also has great advantages for you.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.160
You can focus on your career.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.040
No more juggling work and family.

20:55.360 --> 20:58.440
Just work, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.320
The formula for success.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.040
Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.680
(She laughs)

21:06.560 --> 21:09.240
And Martin is going to be
a fantastic father.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.000
(She laughs)

21:11.080 --> 21:12.520
(Doorbell buzzes)

21:16.800 --> 21:17.800
What's going on?

21:17.960 --> 21:18.960
(Child cries)

21:19.040 --> 21:20.440
-Huh?
-Take him. He's crying non-stop.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.440
Oh, Maxi. Aww. Does Annett know?

21:23.760 --> 21:24.560
Well, I...

21:24.640 --> 21:26.040
Oh, what's wrong?

21:26.400 --> 21:28.040
What's wrong?

21:29.440 --> 21:31.160
Come, let's set up the train set.

21:31.320 --> 21:32.600
(She coos placatingly)

21:40.000 --> 21:41.680
You're going to kidnap the child now?

21:41.760 --> 21:43.080
That was my plan.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.400
You're not serious.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.320
I am.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.960
Mama, this isn't my country anymore.
I don't want Max growing up here.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.280
My dear friend,

21:50.840 --> 21:52.520
you didn't grow up in a country.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.360
You grew up in my house.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.680
The child's mother is here.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.040
Yeah. Annett.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.280
You told me that Annett is never there.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.600
-Annett is...
-...much more reasonable than you,

22:02.680 --> 22:04.120
as far as Max is concerned.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.440
(Boy cries for his mother)

22:05.520 --> 22:06.880
Maxi, I'll be right there.

22:07.240 --> 22:10.000
(Keyboard melody becomes apparent)

22:13.880 --> 22:15.600
I want Max to be free, Mama.

22:17.560 --> 22:18.720
What does free mean?

22:19.160 --> 22:20.600
I'm getting out of the business.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.600
-No one gets out.
-You'll see.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.600
Can you take care of Max today, please?

22:27.120 --> 22:28.240
(Tense string tones)

22:28.320 --> 22:29.280
Where are you going?

22:29.360 --> 22:31.280
Good morning, Berlin!
Thank you for coming!

22:31.440 --> 22:32.800
(A crowd hollers)

22:33.720 --> 22:36.880
First of all, let me remind you all
that AIDS is a disease,

22:37.640 --> 22:39.160
not a moral affliction.

22:42.840 --> 22:44.240
Oh, Comrade Dietrich.

22:44.760 --> 22:45.560
Coffee?

22:45.640 --> 22:47.240
-Gladly.
-It's the good stuff.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.320
(The door closes)

22:49.720 --> 22:52.600
MAN (on TV): AIDS doesn't differentiate
between good and bad people.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.920
AIDS treats us all the same.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.480
Regardless of race...

22:59.680 --> 23:02.520
Thank God we don't have gay men
in this country.

23:02.760 --> 23:06.000
Last quarter, we made almost as much
from selling donated blood

23:06.080 --> 23:08.080
as we did from apples and pears combined.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.040
Imagine if we had
to screen it all for AIDS.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.080
To what do I owe the honor of your visit?

23:15.240 --> 23:16.640
I'm looking for Annett Schneider.

23:18.120 --> 23:19.240
She's not in yet?

23:20.320 --> 23:22.360
-Did she call in sick?
-All I know

23:22.440 --> 23:25.200
is she's in an inappropriate relationship
with our client at Sprembex.

23:25.640 --> 23:27.040
Oh, you mean Herr Amend?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.720
-Who else?
-And by inappropriate, you mean...

23:31.200 --> 23:33.480
You just have to give
young people opportunities.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.960
And to grow with their challenges.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.920
(TV from the off)

23:38.000 --> 23:41.280
I knew from the very beginning
that Annett Schneider had high potential.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.600
-Comrade Fuchs has a nose for talent.
-Exactly.

23:45.840 --> 23:48.200
And the Sprembex deal can now continue.

23:48.280 --> 23:49.360
-Excellent.
-Hm.

23:50.200 --> 23:53.080
MAN (on TV):
But to distract from these facts,

23:53.880 --> 23:56.200
the government of East Germany

23:56.560 --> 23:58.240
has been perpetuating a rumor

23:59.160 --> 24:03.920
that AIDS was developed
by the US military in a laboratory

24:04.440 --> 24:05.720
as a weapon.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.080
They call it:

24:07.160 --> 24:08.480
Operation Infection.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.360
Operation Infection.

24:11.640 --> 24:12.720
That's the KGB.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.320
(Crowd boos and hisses)

24:16.400 --> 24:17.880
He wants to blame us?

24:17.960 --> 24:22.000
But over there our East German friends
are also suffering from AIDS.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.800
And I have proof.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.880
(Applause, cheering)

24:29.760 --> 24:31.120
(A booming)

24:35.480 --> 24:36.720
(Doorbell buzzes)

24:46.840 --> 24:48.120
-Already?
-Change of plans.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.360
Where is he?

24:49.440 --> 24:50.760
Stay calm, Annett.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.920
Max is fine, he's with his grandma.

24:53.760 --> 24:54.920
Ah.

24:55.280 --> 24:56.800
Ingrid is involved, is she?

24:57.720 --> 24:58.760
Sit down, Annett.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.680
We have to talk.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.280
Hm?

25:18.400 --> 25:20.240
Listen, Annett, I want to be honest.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.120
I have something planned
and need your help.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.880
Why should I help you?

25:29.080 --> 25:32.440
If you ever want to see Max again,
you'll do exactly as I say.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.000
You wouldn't do that.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.800
Then you don't know me very well.

25:38.520 --> 25:39.920
Where are Tina Fischer's daughters?

25:44.080 --> 25:45.640
(Loud two-stroke motor)

25:49.800 --> 25:51.040
(Gears grind)

25:53.240 --> 25:54.720
MAN (on TV):
To find a cure,

25:55.520 --> 25:57.040
we have to work together.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.560
And to work together,

25:59.600 --> 26:02.920
we have to throw off
the shackles of prejudice...

26:03.880 --> 26:04.920
Whatever that means.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.520
This disease has been taboo
for far too long.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.480
But we have to face the truth.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.520
(A keyboard booms)

26:12.960 --> 26:15.640
Today I want to say that I...

26:16.000 --> 26:18.640
That I'm a fucking Stasi agent.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.440
That I'm HIV positive.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.800
Tischbier is what?

26:23.360 --> 26:26.000
I was afraid he was going
to out us as well.

26:26.640 --> 26:27.720
(Applause, shouting)

26:27.800 --> 26:29.920
As HVA, Hartmann. As HVA.

26:31.040 --> 26:34.120
And I will spend my remaining time
on this planet

26:35.200 --> 26:36.640
fighting for a cure.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.120
(Cheering)

26:39.240 --> 26:40.040
Well.

26:41.880 --> 26:44.600
Don't forget we have that event
at the US Embassy tonight.

26:45.840 --> 26:46.920
7 p.m. sharp.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.760
The Horry Rocky Show.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.880
It might be funny.

26:51.960 --> 26:52.760
Yeah.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.080
Call Nina,
she should take care of Winkelmann.

26:55.840 --> 26:56.640
Okay.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.240
(Booming)

27:01.280 --> 27:03.280
Orphanage, East Germany

27:03.360 --> 27:05.360
It's so generous of the two of you

27:05.440 --> 27:07.320
to take in older children.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.880
So many young parents
are only interested in babies.

27:15.920 --> 27:18.360
Why don't you tell me
a bit about yourselves?

27:22.560 --> 27:24.040
Would you like to start, darling?

27:27.160 --> 27:27.960
Yes.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.560
We are still very young.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.080
But we've been together for a long time,
since high school.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.400
And we always wanted to have kids.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.920
We actually had a son.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.280
Max.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.120
You can tell her, darling.

27:46.520 --> 27:49.880
For a long time,
I thought I'd never recover from the loss.

27:50.920 --> 27:54.240
It seemed so unjust
he had been taken from me so early.

27:55.520 --> 27:58.960
The only way to bear it
is to hold on to the little moments.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.480
Moments of joy, however brief.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
I'll never forget how it felt
to hold Max in my arms.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.160
But I realized

28:11.320 --> 28:15.800
that there is so much
one can't control in life. Right, darling?

28:23.000 --> 28:23.800
Yes.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.520
The day comes when you have
to look forward and go on.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.200
Yes, we have to go on.

28:30.600 --> 28:31.440
Yes.

28:33.680 --> 28:36.600
I can see that
there's a lot of love in your home.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.560
And no doubt good socialist values.

28:46.480 --> 28:50.320
I'll bring you the sisters whose parents
abandoned them for the West.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.600
Thank you.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.560
(Children singing in the distance,
the door closing)

29:05.160 --> 29:06.920
(Door opens, footsteps)

29:08.600 --> 29:10.440
This is Christa and Michaela.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.000
You can go out again.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.600
Please wait outside.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.280
I don't know.

29:26.360 --> 29:27.880
I imagined them differently.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.040
(Incredulous snorting)

29:29.280 --> 29:31.160
This is not a bowl of cherries!

29:31.560 --> 29:33.560
Besides, what do you expect
on such short notice?

29:33.640 --> 29:35.800
Well, it has to fit, doesn't it?

29:37.440 --> 29:39.120
I have a bad feeling about this.

29:39.760 --> 29:40.560
Yes.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.720
Do you have another pair of sisters?

29:43.720 --> 29:45.280
Those two are very nice but...

29:45.360 --> 29:47.560
We do have another
pair of sisters, the Fischers.

29:47.640 --> 29:49.520
-Yes.
-But they're already taken.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.120
They will be picked up early next week.

29:55.640 --> 29:56.560
(A boom)

29:56.640 --> 29:58.600
Maybe there's something
we can do about that.

29:59.520 --> 30:02.080
We have an important mission,
and it's urgent.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.600
Top-secret.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.560
Yes.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.440
We'd like to see the other sisters.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.760
This is Steffi and Sandra.

30:19.320 --> 30:20.280
You may leave again.

30:20.840 --> 30:22.280
Please wait outside.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.600
(Door closes, echoes)

30:26.760 --> 30:29.280
The Fischers are definitely HVA material.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.760
Yes, and we'd like
to take them with us now.

30:33.960 --> 30:34.760
Yes.

30:36.440 --> 30:38.960
Please go ahead.
I need to fill out the paperwork.

30:39.120 --> 30:39.920
Yes.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.120
Thank you very much.

30:42.320 --> 30:44.840
The girls will do
a great service to East Germany.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.560
And you personally contributed to it.

30:49.920 --> 30:50.720
Good luck.

30:51.000 --> 30:51.880
Thank you.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.040
Have a nice day.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.760
(Mellow guitar kicks in)

30:55.840 --> 30:58.680
(Song: "Science Fiction/Double Feature")

31:00.000 --> 31:01.720
(From: The Rocky Horror Picture Show)

31:05.040 --> 31:07.480
(Vocal sets in)

31:13.880 --> 31:15.280
(Rapid footfall, door closes)

31:15.440 --> 31:17.240
Your mother sent us.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.080
-I don't believe you.
-Come on.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.600
I'm not getting in there.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.000
Okay, listen.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.920
We've known your mother since childhood.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.440
Her name is Tina, her nickname is Knupsi,

31:26.960 --> 31:29.840
and she has a birthmark
between the shoulder blades. Right here.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.120
Steffi?

31:32.840 --> 31:33.680
Sandra!

31:33.840 --> 31:35.360
-We have to hurry.
-Come on.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.800
Steffi!

31:36.880 --> 31:37.840
(Motor starts)

31:37.920 --> 31:38.960
Sandra!

31:44.480 --> 31:47.560
U.S. Mission to East Germany, East Berlin

31:50.120 --> 31:51.320
(German)  Welcome.

31:52.280 --> 31:55.880
Welcome to the Embassy
of the United States of America.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.320
The program contains
the German translation of the movie.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.280
You'll need it...

31:59.520 --> 32:00.720
Your toilet paper roll.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.360
Welcome.

32:05.800 --> 32:08.400
Take a seat in the front row.
It's more fun.

32:11.560 --> 32:14.480
(English) - Enjoy.
-You're looking good. Looking good?

32:14.880 --> 32:18.320
Nothing like sharing the very best
of American culture with our enemies.

32:18.720 --> 32:21.320
Do not underestimate
the value of cultural diplomacy!

32:21.920 --> 32:24.080
Even if everyone in the audience
works for the Stasi?

32:24.480 --> 32:26.480
Especially if everyone in the audience
works for the Stasi!

32:26.880 --> 32:28.320
-Program?
-Yes.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.600
-Ready for your close up, Frau Netz?
-Yes, but...

32:34.000 --> 32:36.960
after the show I need
your help for something important.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.600
Okay.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.920
You're welcome.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.240
(Song fades)

33:00.600 --> 33:01.520
Thank you.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.000
(Motor starts again)

33:06.680 --> 33:07.840
(She guns the engine)

33:09.320 --> 33:11.120
BND Field Office,
West Berlin, West Germany

33:11.200 --> 33:13.040
(Beating synth kicks in)

33:31.960 --> 33:32.800
(Sighs)

33:36.800 --> 33:39.040
(Booming as of a power outage)

33:41.160 --> 33:42.720
(Bar music and chatter)

34:04.760 --> 34:05.840
Gianni,

34:06.480 --> 34:08.320
another Martini with a twist.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.600
And one for the lady, too.

34:19.240 --> 34:20.040
May I?

34:20.680 --> 34:21.880
The seat is free.

34:26.840 --> 34:28.680
I left my wife this morning.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.160
Lucky me.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.040
In truth, I tried to run,

34:42.120 --> 34:44.680
but there are no flights
to Cape Town until tomorrow.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.160
Then at least we have tonight.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.640
(Electro thunder)

34:52.960 --> 34:54.880
(Staccato keyboards)

35:09.240 --> 35:10.760
(Rain and thunder)

35:13.200 --> 35:15.200
(Laughter)

35:21.280 --> 35:23.360
(Song: "Over The Frankenstein")

35:36.840 --> 35:38.480
(Lightning striking)

35:45.680 --> 35:46.720
(Drum-rolls)

36:23.120 --> 36:25.120
(Song closes)

36:34.680 --> 36:35.560
Herr Rauch.

36:36.720 --> 36:37.560
Come here, please.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.040
(Clucking)

36:44.200 --> 36:45.440
What are their names?

36:45.680 --> 36:47.440
Steffi, Sandra, Lenora.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.160
That's Katie and I'm Hilde.

36:51.760 --> 36:52.760
Hi, don't worry.

36:52.840 --> 36:54.240
We were at a play.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.360
We dressed up.

36:55.440 --> 36:58.800
Yes, and now Katie will put some
fancy makeup on you, okay?

37:01.920 --> 37:05.160
Our colleague from the US Embassy
will drive you across.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.000
They don't check diplomatic vehicles.

37:07.080 --> 37:08.320
We have two cars.

37:08.760 --> 37:09.560
Good.

37:09.840 --> 37:10.920
Where's the boy?

37:13.080 --> 37:13.920
He's staying here.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.520
(Footsteps hurrying away)

37:27.160 --> 37:28.080
Thank you.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.000
Take care.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.400
(Car door thuds)

37:35.560 --> 37:37.800
Okay. Who's ready for a real adventure?

37:38.920 --> 37:40.880
I'll turn the music way up,

37:41.120 --> 37:42.480
and we'll all dance.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.920
And when we go across the border,

37:45.080 --> 37:46.000
you just smile.

37:47.280 --> 37:48.400
All right?

37:49.440 --> 37:51.040
We can do it, hm?

37:52.600 --> 37:54.400
(80s beat, Def Leppard's
"Rock Of Ages" kicks in)

38:07.000 --> 38:07.680
Yeah!

38:48.360 --> 38:49.920
(Beeper)

38:54.040 --> 38:55.920
(Enthusiastic roaring)

39:02.640 --> 39:04.080
(Drum crash, music fades)

39:11.160 --> 39:12.560
(A car approaching)

39:22.040 --> 39:23.440
(Ambient soundtrack)

39:24.000 --> 39:25.160
Good luck, you two!

39:25.320 --> 39:26.120
Take care.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.080
Don't worry, okay?

39:27.200 --> 39:28.600
(English)  Take care.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.840
-Thank you very much.
-Bye.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.440
(German)  Now we have to see

39:36.480 --> 39:37.480
where your mother is.

39:40.000 --> 39:40.800
There's Mama!

39:40.880 --> 39:42.000
Mama!

39:42.960 --> 39:43.880
Mama!

39:44.240 --> 39:45.840
(Soothing keyboard melody)

39:50.360 --> 39:51.920
I've missed you so much.

39:59.880 --> 40:00.840
Uncle Thomas!

40:04.200 --> 40:05.360
Where's Dad?

40:11.000 --> 40:12.160
Brigitte Winkelmann!

40:14.920 --> 40:16.160
What are you doing here?

40:16.640 --> 40:17.760
Having you arrested.

40:19.840 --> 40:20.760
Where's Martin?

40:23.480 --> 40:25.440
(An approaching car
drowns out the keyboard)

40:25.760 --> 40:26.680
Where is Martin?

40:27.840 --> 40:29.000
Martin isn't coming.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.360
(Car screeches, piano booms)

40:31.440 --> 40:33.320
I can get in by myself.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.840
I can get in by myself!

40:37.040 --> 40:38.560
(Tires screech)

40:47.400 --> 40:48.720
(A booming)

40:49.840 --> 40:52.080
(Taps keys, receipt rolls)

40:52.400 --> 40:54.360
(Panicky breathing)

40:55.400 --> 40:56.440
(Sniffles)

41:00.400 --> 41:01.440
What's going on here?

41:05.480 --> 41:06.440
The cruise ship,

41:06.600 --> 41:09.200
a loss of 30 million DM.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.320
The Würfel & Struth torpedoes,

41:11.600 --> 41:13.480
a loss of 20 million DM.

41:13.760 --> 41:16.960
The sabotaged Sprembex trial,

41:17.440 --> 41:19.120
a loss of 50 thousand DM.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.400
Projected revenue
from fruit and vegetable sales,

41:21.480 --> 41:24.800
lost due to contamination from Chernobyl,
a loss of half a billion DM.

41:24.880 --> 41:28.000
-Stop it.
-These are only the tip of the iceberg.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.480
We'll have new ideas.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.520
I don't want to hear any new ideas!

41:32.240 --> 41:35.200
The bedrock of our export revenue
is blood sales,

41:35.280 --> 41:36.640
transfusion bulk and plasma.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.840
Hospitals and pharmaceutical companies
in the West

41:39.920 --> 41:41.280
can't get enough of it.

41:41.360 --> 41:42.480
And the best part?

41:43.480 --> 41:45.160
It costs us almost nothing to produce.

41:45.240 --> 41:48.200
Our lazy citizens produce it for free.

41:48.880 --> 41:50.760
We just pump, bag and ship!

41:51.720 --> 41:52.920
Easy money.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.800
But now some sick little faggot
in the West

41:55.880 --> 41:57.200
goes on TV

41:57.640 --> 42:00.080
and announced that the AIDS virus

42:01.120 --> 42:02.680
is spreading like wildfire over here.

42:02.760 --> 42:05.080
One person cannot bring down
an entire country.

42:05.160 --> 42:07.720
If the country is only
propped up on rickety stilts?

42:07.800 --> 42:08.760
Yes, he can.

42:08.840 --> 42:13.600
This country still stands on
a strong foundation of good values.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.000
Good values don't pay the rent.

42:16.440 --> 42:17.560
Money pays the rent.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.000
Good values are just...

42:19.480 --> 42:20.560
window dressing.

42:20.640 --> 42:21.760
Here.

42:22.560 --> 42:24.640
(Sobs, blows her nose)

42:31.440 --> 42:34.120
Our celebrations
could have been so wonderful.

42:34.360 --> 42:36.240
The 25th anniversary of the Wall?

42:36.440 --> 42:37.280
Yes.

42:37.360 --> 42:41.040
Fireworks, blue skies, raspberry bushes.

42:43.560 --> 42:45.800
A celebration of everything
we've achieved here.

42:47.120 --> 42:49.240
Now it will just be a parade.

42:51.680 --> 42:53.480
Better a parade than...

42:57.160 --> 42:59.640
I'll still call Mielke
about the raspberries.

43:20.120 --> 43:21.160
(Exhales)

43:32.200 --> 43:33.000
Yes?

43:33.080 --> 43:34.000
Who's there?

43:34.320 --> 43:35.160
Hey!

43:40.200 --> 43:42.480
(English)  How'd you like the show?

43:44.600 --> 43:46.400
It's the middle of the night.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.920
It's actually early in the morning.

43:50.640 --> 43:53.920
I was thinking
you might have a key to my place.

43:55.560 --> 43:57.480
I... Why?

43:59.120 --> 44:01.840
Because I lost mine in Kreuzberg.

44:02.240 --> 44:05.240
And I don't want to wake up
my wife Maria because

44:05.640 --> 44:08.560
if she finds out I was dancing with Katie
she's gonna kill me.

44:08.960 --> 44:12.600
I mean, why do you think
I have a key to your apartment?

44:14.560 --> 44:16.080
I'll tell you what.

44:16.440 --> 44:18.880
I'm gonna wait right here,

44:19.760 --> 44:22.360
and you will call
whoever you have to call.

44:23.440 --> 44:24.960
I owe you one.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.720
(Synthetic, wind-like tones)

44:48.280 --> 44:50.400
(Bass sets in)

44:57.040 --> 44:58.920
(Melody weaves in and out)

45:10.440 --> 45:12.640
(Cello sets in)

45:22.960 --> 45:24.080
(Music fades)

45:25.240 --> 45:27.520
(Synth assumes the melody)

45:38.120 --> 45:39.480
(Building to a crescendo)

45:39.720 --> 45:41.400
(Gulls call)

45:50.560 --> 45:52.040
(Modem tones)

45:57.200 --> 45:58.800
(Beeping becomes a fixed pitch)

46:00.040 --> 46:01.600
(Phone ringing)

46:03.320 --> 46:04.840
(Phone ringing)

46:05.960 --> 46:06.760
Hello?

46:06.840 --> 46:08.520
(Beeping down the line)

46:08.600 --> 46:10.640
(Music races)

46:12.520 --> 46:14.320
SAFE IN CAPE TOWN.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.920
I'M WAITING FOR YOU, MY LOVE.

46:19.600 --> 46:22.840
MAN (on TV): Mr. Posimski, we've
heard you are working on a new book.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.640
I think your fans would love
to know what it's about.

46:25.720 --> 46:28.280
Well. Inspiration struck me
like a lightning bolt.

46:28.560 --> 46:32.320
It's a story about
a reluctant spy from East Germany.

46:32.400 --> 46:35.600
He wants to get out
of the spy game, go home,

46:35.960 --> 46:37.320
and live the simple life,

46:37.400 --> 46:39.680
but his reputation precedes him.

46:39.760 --> 46:43.360
Everywhere he goes,
people either want his help

46:43.440 --> 46:44.760
or want to kill him.

46:46.480 --> 46:49.800
A Candide of the 20th century.

46:50.200 --> 46:51.240
Sounds interesting.

46:51.840 --> 46:53.440
And what is it called?

46:54.160 --> 46:55.560
I think I'll call it:

46:56.200 --> 46:58.440
(Patriotic, anthemic song,
The Song of Turbulent Youth, sets in)

46:58.520 --> 47:00.240
The Legend of Kolibri.

47:25.040 --> 47:27.320
(Suspenseful music)

48:03.320 --> 48:05.040
(Eerie music)

49:11.480 --> 49:13.080
