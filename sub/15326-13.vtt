09:53.926 --> 09:56.345
- NO.

09:56.429 --> 10:00.182
IT'S VERY FLAVORFUL,

10:00.266 --> 10:03.019
LIKE THE ATLANTIC.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.187
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:05.271 --> 10:09.358
OH, GOD.
OH.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.736
THAT'S HORRIBLE.
NOW WE DON'T HAVE AN APPETIZER.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.903
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

10:12.987 --> 10:14.530
- IF I WERE YOU,
I'D GO CHECK THE ENTREE.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.699
- THE ENTREE'S FINE.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.993
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
THE ENTREE.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.745
[doorbell rings]

10:24.582 --> 10:25.458
- WHOA.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.961
PAGING DOCTOR YOU-DA-MAN.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.216
BEVERLY!
- CHARLES, LOVELY TO SEE YOU.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.093
- ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.929
- OH, THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL HOME.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.723
MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED
THAT PROMOTION.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.893
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE PAYING YOU
TOO MUCH ALREADY.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.395
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
MY MIDDLE KID HAS NO SHOES.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.646
[laughter]

10:47.730 --> 10:52.777
- NO SHOES.
OH, BUT A VERY STYLISH NANNY.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.821
I LOVE YOUR EARRINGS.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.198
- THANK YOU,
BUT I'M NOT THE NANNY.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.116
I'M STEPHANIE.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.576
- OH.

11:00.659 --> 11:02.244
CHARLES, WHEN YOU SAID YOU HAD
A NEW WIFE,

11:02.328 --> 11:06.374
YOU DIDN'T SAY SHE WAS FRESH
OUT OF THE BOX.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.125
SHE'S ADORABLE.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.668
WHERE ARE YOUR OTHER CHILDREN?

11:09.752 --> 11:13.339
- OH, THEY'RE--
WAIT. WHAT?

11:13.422 --> 11:14.632
- I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM
SINCE THE DIVORCE.

11:14.715 --> 11:20.179
OH, SUCH A TRAGEDY.
I KNOW MINE WAS EVISCERATING.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.680
OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THE CHILDREN.

11:21.764 --> 11:25.601
I REMEMBER YOUR FIRST WIFE
WAS RAISING THEM SO WELL.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.104
- WELL, MY SECOND WIFE IS DOING
PRETTY NICELY HERSELF.

11:28.187 --> 11:31.941
YOU'LL SEE FOR YOURSELF
WHEN THEY JOIN US FOR DINNER.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.194
- YEAH.
WAIT. WHAT?

11:35.277 --> 11:36.946
CHARLIE, CAN YOU HELP ME
IN THE KITCHEN?

11:37.029 --> 11:37.446
- [clears throat]

11:37.530 --> 11:39.615
EXCUSE ME.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.992
- CHARLIE,
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

11:42.076 --> 11:43.702
INCLUDING THE KIDS AT DINNER?

11:43.786 --> 11:44.912
- I'M THINKING I'M GONNA PROVE
YOU'RE A GREAT MOTHER.

11:44.995 --> 11:47.957
- WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOOD
FOR SIX PEOPLE.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.625
- WELL, THE KIDS DON'T EAT
THAT MUCH,

11:49.708 --> 11:51.627
AND SQUAB IS LIKE A TURKEY,
RIGHT?

11:51.710 --> 11:55.506
- NO, IT'S A PIGEON--
A TINY PIGEON.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.425
AND I DON'T SEE WHY I HAVE TO
PROVE ANYTHING TO THAT WOMAN.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.552
WHAT IS HER PROBLEM ANYWAY?

11:59.635 --> 12:00.886
- OH, WHO KNOWS.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.805
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
A LITTLE DIFFICULT.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.099
- BELIEVE ME,
NO ONE WAS SURPRISED

12:05.182 --> 12:09.103
WHEN HER HUSBAND LEFT HER
FOR A YOUNGER WOMAN.

12:09.186 --> 12:12.064
OKAY, WE MAY HAVE A PROBLEM.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.859
- HOW COULD YOU NOT
TELL ME THAT?

12:14.942 --> 12:16.527
- I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS IMPORTANT.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.820
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH US.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.947
- WELL, GOOD THING WE EXPANDED
THE TABLE

12:20.030 --> 12:22.908
SO THERE'D BE EXTRA ROOM
FOR HER BAGGAGE.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.827
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
NO PROMOTION IS WORTH THIS.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.203
I'LL JUST GO OUT THERE
AND TELL HER,

12:26.287 --> 12:27.830
IF SHE CAN'T SPEAK TO YOU
RESPECTFULLY,

12:27.913 --> 12:28.831
THEN SHE NEEDS TO LEAVE.

12:28.914 --> 12:29.957
- NO, NO, NO.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.333
I CAN HANDLE ANYTHING
FOR ONE NIGHT.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.127
- GOOD, BECAUSE I REALLY WANT
THAT PROMOTION.

12:36.130 --> 12:36.964
- I'M GONNA FIND MY FRAZZLE.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.008
- I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.343
- THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.679
AND YOU ALREADY DRANK ONE.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.347
IF YOU DIDN'T DRINK IT,
AND I DIDN'T DRINK IT,

12:45.431 --> 12:46.390
WHO DRANK IT?

12:46.474 --> 12:48.809
- PARTY!

12:48.893 --> 12:51.145
WE HAVE A PARTY UP
IN THIS HOUSE, LADIES!

12:51.228 --> 12:52.146
PARTY!

12:52.229 --> 12:56.358
PARTY!

12:56.442 --> 12:57.735
PARTY, PARTY, PARTY, PARTY!

12:57.818 --> 12:59.403
COME ON, DANCE, PEOPLE.
DANCE PARTY.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.781
PARTY! PARTY!

13:02.865 --> 13:05.326
WHOO, THIS IS A PARTY!

13:09.955 --> 13:12.750
- GABBY, I DON'T KNOW WHO DRANK
YOUR FRAZZLE.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.084
MAYBE NOBODY DID.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.379
- [screaming]

13:17.463 --> 13:19.173
- MAYBE AARON DID.

13:19.256 --> 13:23.677
- I'M GONNA WEAR ALL MY CLOTHES
AT THE SAME TIME!

13:25.596 --> 13:28.557
- ANYONE KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED?

13:28.641 --> 13:29.391
FRAZZLE?

13:29.475 --> 13:31.185
YOU GAVE HIM AN ENERGY DRINK?

13:31.268 --> 13:32.269
- NO, HE JUST STOLE IT

13:32.353 --> 13:33.395
FROM WHOEVER BROUGHT IT
INTO THE HOUSE.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.065
I BET IT WAS DAD.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.233
- [breathes deeply]

13:37.316 --> 13:38.567
NOT GONNA PANIC.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.153
JUST ANOTHER BALL IN THE AIR.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.364
EVERYBODY,
PUT ON YOUR CHURCH CLOTHES.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.365
YOU'RE HAVING DINNER WITH US.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.033
- ARE YOU GONNA TELL DAD
ABOUT THIS?

13:46.116 --> 13:47.576
- NOT IF YOU HANDLE THAT.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.288
- I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS!

13:53.332 --> 13:55.125
- ALL RIGHT,
HERE IS THE RADICCHIO,

13:55.209 --> 13:59.380
AND I HATE TO BRAG,
BUT IT IS RAD-ICULOUSLY GOOD.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.257
[forced laughter]

14:01.340 --> 14:03.968
- I DON'T GET IT,
BUT IT'S HILARIOUS.

14:04.051 --> 14:06.262
- STEPHANIE IS ALWAYS
MAKING US LAUGH.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.096
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY:

14:07.179 --> 14:09.431
LAUGHTER IS THE BEST MEDICINE.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.725
- UNLESS YOU'RE DYING.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.770
- OKAY.
WHO NEEDS SOME WINE?

14:14.853 --> 14:16.146
I KNOW I DO.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.189
- ME TOO!

14:17.273 --> 14:18.399
AND SOME PEANUT BUTTER
AND JELLY

14:18.482 --> 14:19.817
AND A HOT DOG
AND A CHICKEN WING.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.362
- UH, BEVERLY, CAN I POUR YOU
A GLASS?

14:23.445 --> 14:24.905
- YES, BUT I HAVE TO WARN YOU,

14:24.989 --> 14:25.823
I AM A BIT OF A WINE SNOB.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.616
- WELL, THEN YOU'LL LOVE THIS.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.286
IT IS A VERY RARE PINOT NOIR.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.579
[chuckles]

14:33.414 --> 14:34.999
HOW DOES IT TASTE, BEVERLY?

14:35.082 --> 14:37.001
- LIKE YOU WERE MAKING MOONSHINE
IN YOUR DORM ROOM.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.131
- MM.
WOW.

14:42.214 --> 14:45.384
THAT IS NOT GOOD.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

14:45.467 --> 14:49.138
- PERHAPS YOU LEFT IT IN THE SUN
DURING CHEERLEADING PRACTICE.

14:49.221 --> 14:52.224
- OKAY, BEVERLY, I WAS GONNA LET
"DORM ROOM" GO

14:52.308 --> 14:53.601
BECAUSE I WAS...

14:53.684 --> 14:54.643
KIND OF FLATTERED,

14:54.727 --> 14:55.519
BUT--

14:55.603 --> 14:57.813
- IS THAT THE KITCHEN TIMER?

14:57.896 --> 14:59.523
CHARLIE.
A LITTLE HELP.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.317
GABBY, JAMES,
HOLD DOWN THE FORT.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.443
HE'S THE FORT.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.198
CHARLIE, I KNOW YOU WANT
TO STICK UP FOR ME,

15:08.282 --> 15:09.450
BUT EYES ON THE PRIZE.

15:09.533 --> 15:10.868
WE JUST HAVE TO SUCK IT UP
FOR ONE NIGHT.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.453
- IT STINKS.
- I KNOW.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.954
BUT WE'RE TALKING A COUPLE
OF HOURS FOR YOUR FUTURE.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.790
- NO, SERIOUSLY,
SOMETHING STINKS.

15:16.874 --> 15:17.916
- [sniffs]

15:18.000 --> 15:20.878
[gasps]
MY PIGEONS!

15:24.089 --> 15:26.300
GABBY, JAMES, MAY I SEE YOU?

15:26.383 --> 15:28.510
- I SMELL SMOKE.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.304
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?

15:32.848 --> 15:33.515
- LET'S PLAY
DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.351
DUCK...
DUCK...

15:35.434 --> 15:37.978
{\an5}DUCK...
DUCK...

15:38.062 --> 15:39.563
DUCK...
- GOOSE.

15:44.526 --> 15:47.655
- WHAT IS THIS?
- SQUAB?

15:47.738 --> 15:50.616
- NO, IT'S MY STUFF.
YOU MELTED MY CHILDHOOD.

15:50.699 --> 15:51.700
- HEY.
- JAMES!

15:51.784 --> 15:53.035
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.787
- WHY IS AARON ACTING LIKE
THAT CRAZY SQUIRREL

15:54.870 --> 15:55.663
AT OUR WEDDING?

15:55.746 --> 15:57.122
- GABBY GAVE HIM FRAZZLE.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.083
- I DIDN'T GIVE IT TO HIM.
HE STOLE IT.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.460
- BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO HAVE FRAZZLE.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.878
YOU'RE GROUNDED.

16:02.961 --> 16:05.547
- THAT'S SOME GOOD PARENTING,
DAD.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.632
- YOU'RE GROUNDED TOO.

16:06.715 --> 16:07.716
- FOR WHAT?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.718
- FOR STEALING AND MELTING
MY STUFF.

16:09.802 --> 16:13.097
- AND FOR RUINING MY SQUAB!

16:13.180 --> 16:16.600
- OH, THAT'S SQUAB.
I WOULD NOT HAVE GUESSED THAT.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.353
- IS EVERYBODY OKAY?
I SAW SMOKE.

16:19.436 --> 16:22.815
AND NOT BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING
THROUGH YOUR WINDOW.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.233
- YOU NEVER LEFT?

16:24.316 --> 16:25.567
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE SITTING
OUT THERE

16:25.651 --> 16:27.194
WAITING FOR ME TO FAIL,

16:27.277 --> 16:28.445
BUT I DIDN'T FAIL.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.489
I WAS JUGGLING JUST FINE
UNTIL YOU ALL CAME IN

16:30.572 --> 16:33.242
THROWING CHAINSAWS.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.119
- I WANT TO PLAY WITH CHAINSAWS.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.204
- HERE. HERE.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.414
- HEY!

16:38.497 --> 16:40.082
I'M GONNA GO PLAY CHAINSAW
WITH THAT LADY!

16:40.165 --> 16:41.083
LADY!

16:41.166 --> 16:42.793
- KIDS, HANDLE THAT!

16:42.876 --> 16:45.462
- WE'RE GONNA NEED DINNER.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.756
LET'S SEE.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.591
I'VE GOT HOT SAUCE, TUNA,
AND PEANUT BUTTER.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.468
WHAT CAN I MAKE WITH THAT?

16:51.552 --> 16:54.388
SPICY NUT FISH?

16:54.471 --> 16:55.347
- OR CHICKEN MARSALA.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.057
- HOW CAN YOU MAKE
CHICKEN MARSALA

16:57.141 --> 16:58.434
WITH HOT SAUCE, TUNA,
AND PEANUT BUTTER?

16:58.517 --> 17:00.519
- THROW IT ALL AWAY AND GO GET
THE CHICKEN MARSALA I MADE

17:00.602 --> 17:03.397
OUT IN THE CAR.

17:07.943 --> 17:12.196
- I HOPE EVERYONE SAVED ROOM
FOR CREME BRULEE.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.656
- CREME BRULEE.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.451
NOT BAD.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.868
CHICKEN WAS EDIBLE TOO.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.203
MAYBE A BIT DRY.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.038
- WHAT?

17:19.663 --> 17:21.749
- WHAT WAS THAT?

17:21.832 --> 17:23.125
- WE HAVE A BIRD.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.376
- WE KEEP LEAVING THE CAGE OPEN,

17:24.460 --> 17:25.042
BUT SHE WON'T FLY AWAY.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.465
- YUM.
YUM.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.674
- OH, NO, NO, NO, SWEETIE.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.093
YOU BREAK THE SHELL WITH
THE BACK OF YOUR SPOON.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.971
- WHOA.
A DESSERT AND A GAME.

17:36.054 --> 17:38.307
- LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT,
BUDDY.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.100
HERE, PLAY WITH YOUR NAPKIN.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.603
- I'M A HELICOPTER.
WHOO!

17:42.686 --> 17:44.396
WHOO!

17:44.480 --> 17:46.023
- GROSS, MINE'S BURNT.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.483
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.817
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOURS DOES
LOOK A LITTLE BURNT.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.110
LET ME PUT IT OUT FOR YOU.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.199
- HEY, I WANTED TO EAT THAT.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.743
IF I DIDN'T EAT STEPHANIE'S
BURNT THINGS,

17:57.826 --> 17:58.786
I WOULD STARVE.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.163
YOU OWE ME A CREAM THINGY.

18:01.246 --> 18:01.288
[all scream]

18:04.500 --> 18:06.043
- I'M SO SORRY.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.544
- LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.172
THIS CHEAP SWILL
IS NEVER GONNA COME OUT.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.673
- HERE, LET ME GET YOU
SOME WATER FOR THAT.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.468
- HEY, I GOT WATER.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.469
- OH!

18:15.552 --> 18:16.929
- YEAH.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.138
- THAT'S IT, CHARLES.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.516
I'M NOT GONNA STAY HERE
ANOTHER MINUTE

18:20.599 --> 18:23.477
WITH YOUR TEEN BRIDE AND THESE
MONSTERS YOU CALL CHILDREN.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.937
- BEVERLY--
- I'M SORRY.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.815
BITTER LADY IN THE TACKY DRESS
SAID WHAT?

18:27.898 --> 18:29.358
LISTEN UP, DR. MISSY.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.027
ALL YOU'VE DONE SINCE YOU'VE GOT
HERE IS TAKE SHOTS AT ME

18:32.110 --> 18:36.031
AND WEAR THE WRONG COLOR
LIPSTICK.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.033
YOU WANT TO GO AFTER ME BECAUSE
YOUR HUSBAND LEFT YOU

18:38.116 --> 18:39.034
FOR A YOUNGER WOMAN?

18:39.117 --> 18:39.993
FINE.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.411
BUT GO AFTER MY CHILDREN,

18:41.495 --> 18:44.081
I WILL HAVE TO SHUT YOU DOWN.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.249
THESE ARE GREAT KIDS.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.875
NO MATTER WHO'S SETTING FIRES

18:46.959 --> 18:48.877
OR GETTING FRAZZLED,

18:48.961 --> 18:51.046
AND THIS FAMILY MIGHT LOOK
LIKE CHAOS TO YOU,

18:51.129 --> 18:52.881
BUT IT IS SOLID.

18:52.965 --> 18:53.882
TRUST.

18:53.966 --> 18:54.967
[all gasp]

19:00.806 --> 19:02.766
- YOU OKAY?
- [sighs]

19:02.850 --> 19:03.725
I'M SORRY, CHARLIE.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.894
I COULDN'T HOLD IT IN ANYMORE.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.480
AND NOW YOU'LL NEVER BE
THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.566
- PROBABLY NOT.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.442
- SO WHY ARE YOU SMILING
LIKE THAT?

19:12.526 --> 19:15.571
- BECAUSE YOU CALLED THEM
YOUR CHILDREN.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.073
- SO?

19:18.156 --> 19:21.326
- SO I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU
SAY THAT BEFORE.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.078
THAT'S WHAT MAKES A MOTHER.

19:23.161 --> 19:25.747
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
MY MOTHER SAYS.

19:25.831 --> 19:30.961
SHE SAYS IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE
TO JUGGLE A MILLION BALLS.

19:31.044 --> 19:35.507
- NAH, IT'S KNOWING WHEN
THE MILLION BALLS DROP,

19:35.591 --> 19:38.343
WHICH THREE TO CATCH.

19:38.427 --> 19:42.264
THAT SAID, NEXT TIME BEVERLY
COMES FOR DINNER,

19:42.347 --> 19:44.641
WE'RE CATERING.

19:44.725 --> 19:45.809
- GOOD.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.561
I'LL LET YOUR THIRD WIFE KNOW.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.228
[both laugh]

19:52.649 --> 19:53.901
- AARON FINALLY RAN OUT OF GAS.

19:53.984 --> 19:54.735
- YEAH.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.111
- PUTTING HIM ON THE TREADMILL

19:56.194 --> 19:57.404
WAS A GOOD IDEA.

19:57.487 --> 20:00.157
I DID FEEL BAD ABOUT THE WAY
HE FLEW OFF AT THE END.

20:00.240 --> 20:04.161
- GOOD THING HE WAS WEARING
A HELMET.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.246
- GABBY, I HOPE YOU LEARNED
YOUR LESSON ABOUT FRAZZLE.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.456
- YOU'RE KIDDING?

20:07.539 --> 20:08.957
I'M NEVER BUYING
AN ENERGY DRINK AGAIN.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.000
- GOOD.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.627
THEN GO GET ME
THE OTHER THREE CANS.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.045
- I DON'T HAVE THEM.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.796
- JAMES?
- DON'T LOOK AT ME.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.299
- WELL, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM
AND YOU DON'T HAVE THEM,

20:17.382 --> 20:19.593
AND HE DIDN'T DRINK THEM,
WHERE'D THEY ALL GO?

20:19.676 --> 20:22.221
- LET'S GET THIS DINING ROOM
ALL CLEANED UP!

20:22.304 --> 20:24.598
I WASHED THE DISHES!
POLISHED THE SILVERWARE!

20:24.681 --> 20:25.307
PAINTED HALF THE DEN!

20:25.390 --> 20:27.809
WHO'S UP FOR ZUMBA?
