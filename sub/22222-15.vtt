WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.586
Previously on Farscape.

00:02.670 --> 00:06.333
Furlow:
The ability to create a
stable wormhole travel

00:06.424 --> 00:08.665
through space and time
would be...

00:08.759 --> 00:09.623
Profitable.

00:09.719 --> 00:10.834
Probably.

00:10.928 --> 00:14.136
You made me think you
were my father!

00:14.223 --> 00:16.635
Show me what you really
look like.

00:18.853 --> 00:23.267
Jack:
On our travel to the new world,
we saw this.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.815
Your module, being flown
through an unstable wormhole,

00:26.903 --> 00:29.144
piloted by this creature.

00:29.238 --> 00:30.398
Crichton:
Who the hell is that?

00:30.489 --> 00:32.195
Are you saying this is
a duplication?

00:32.283 --> 00:34.569
Scorpius didn't copy
your module.

00:34.660 --> 00:35.740
So who did it?

00:35.828 --> 00:37.159
What do you think?

00:37.246 --> 00:38.361
Furlow.

00:38.456 --> 00:41.038
Got a nice detailed scan
last time you were here.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.456
Put 'em on. Flare's coming.

00:42.543 --> 00:43.407
How do you know?

00:43.502 --> 00:45.003
I can sense them.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.917
( screaming )

00:50.343 --> 00:52.425
Talyn is blinded and so am I!

00:53.095 --> 00:54.255
Here they come!

00:58.184 --> 01:00.300
If it isn't my favorite flyboy.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.100
Just couldn't stay away
from me, huh?

01:02.188 --> 01:04.645
You fear me.
-No, you just smell.

01:04.732 --> 01:09.977
He did tell me that there's
a Scarran Dreadnought heading
for this planet.

01:10.071 --> 01:13.154
It will arrive within six arns.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.651
How much data did they get?

01:14.742 --> 01:17.358
Oh, enough to make their
own Phase Stabilizer,

01:17.453 --> 01:21.696
but I guarantee, the Dreadnought
will still get here.

01:21.791 --> 01:24.328
Rygel:
Charrid cowards couldn't hit
a pregnant lobboth!

01:25.419 --> 01:27.535
(moaning)

01:27.630 --> 01:29.461
Crichton:
I knew about the stuff you
guys put in my head.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.084
How?
-Guy named Scorpius.

01:31.175 --> 01:32.881
He discovered the info
was there

01:32.969 --> 01:37.087
and he put a neurochip in my
head to extract the information.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.888
I will fight you
and I will win.

01:40.643 --> 01:42.133
( screaming )

01:44.480 --> 01:46.391
(choking and gasping)

01:51.362 --> 01:53.774
Crichton-Scorpius:
Officer Sun.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.150
What luscious lips,

01:56.242 --> 01:59.200
amongst other things.

01:59.287 --> 02:03.200
Crichton was a very lucky man.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.406
Where is he?

02:04.500 --> 02:06.161
Gone.

02:06.252 --> 02:08.038
Gambled and lost.

02:11.257 --> 02:12.212
Oh...

02:13.301 --> 02:15.417
And now, on Farscape...

02:15.511 --> 02:18.218
How unfortunate you must
lose as well.

02:18.306 --> 02:21.890
And Zhaan gave herself for you.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.392
What a waste, wouldn't you say?

02:32.194 --> 02:34.150
Well.

02:34.238 --> 02:38.231
That's hardly sporting, is it?

02:38.326 --> 02:40.362
I should have a weapon as well.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.909
Then we can settle this.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.032
One-on-one.

02:44.123 --> 02:45.329
Dont

02:45.416 --> 02:46.997
(grunts)

02:50.212 --> 02:55.377
It's not easy, is it?

02:55.468 --> 02:58.255
Putting a pulse blast in
John Crichton?

02:59.096 --> 03:00.176
You're not John.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.880
Not up here, no.

03:02.975 --> 03:05.352
But the rest of his
body's intact.

03:05.436 --> 03:08.894
Be a shame to spoil it
with that.

03:08.981 --> 03:12.974
I'm much more reasonable
than John is.

03:13.069 --> 03:16.106
He didn't want to share
his mind with me,

03:16.197 --> 03:20.657
but I'm more than willing to
share his body with you.

03:24.789 --> 03:26.199
No!

03:26.290 --> 03:27.405
Stand clear.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.831
Jack:
No, don't!

03:28.918 --> 03:31.284
It isn't John.
-It is John.

03:31.379 --> 03:32.209
Look.

03:32.296 --> 03:34.252
Thank you, Daddy.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.830
Look at him.

03:35.925 --> 03:38.132
The clone is dying.

03:38.219 --> 03:41.427
He wants you to shoot him
so John dies, too.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.342
Officer Sun.

03:45.226 --> 03:50.892
Next time, be more decisive.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.723
Shoot”

03:55.194 --> 03:57.059
quicker.

04:01.117 --> 04:03.153
A soldier...

04:03.244 --> 04:06.111
must not be weak.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.250
Weakness means defeat.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.620
(agonized screaming )

04:30.396 --> 04:32.478
Hey, baby.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.193
He's gone.

04:41.824 --> 04:44.315
He's finally gone.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.527
It's just me.

05:20.738 --> 05:22.319
Stark:
Can anyone hear me?

05:22.406 --> 05:24.397
Aeryn? Crichton? Rygel?

05:24.492 --> 05:27.734
Forget the comms! Run a check
on all the airlocks and
docking bays.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.908
What for?

05:28.996 --> 05:31.533
Damage, malfunction, anything.
-Why?

05:31.624 --> 05:37.335
Because I know this ship and...
and something is out of balance.

05:37.421 --> 05:39.662
You're imagining things...

05:39.757 --> 05:42.294
although this is strange.
-What?

05:42.384 --> 05:46.423
Docking Bay Two recently
performed an atmosphere
replenish as if it had been opened.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.926
But we landed the Pod
in Bay One.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.008
Talyn! Seal all hatches!

05:53.312 --> 05:55.223
( screaming )

06:01.362 --> 06:03.978
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

06:04.073 --> 06:07.782
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

06:07.868 --> 06:09.199
I'm trying to stay alive...

06:09.286 --> 06:11.197
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

06:11.288 --> 06:14.246
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.789
If you can hear me...
Beware.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.867
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

06:17.962 --> 06:20.419
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

06:20.506 --> 06:25.216
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.384
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

06:27.471 --> 06:30.213
Not show them...
You exist...

06:30.307 --> 06:34.016
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

07:11.682 --> 07:16.096
I've had Scorpy in my head
for so long that I've
gotten used to it,

07:16.186 --> 07:19.053
and... and not having him...

07:20.733 --> 07:25.693
it's like being in pain
your whole life and
suddenly it's gone.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.647
Furlow:
Jack, I managed to find some
e-transmitter coils.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.573
They'll need a bit of work.

07:34.038 --> 07:35.198
This is it?

07:35.289 --> 07:36.449
Can't find anything better?

07:36.540 --> 07:39.122
I had to search half the
complex just to find that.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.746
Then search the other
half, Furlow.

07:50.429 --> 07:51.965
John?

07:52.056 --> 07:55.219
It's time to go to work. If
you're feeling strong enough.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.015
I'm good.

07:57.102 --> 08:01.220
But, ah, you'd better unlock
that wormhole information
inside my head.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.647
ljust did.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.895
You did? Really?

08:05.986 --> 08:08.568
It doesn't happen
instantaneously.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.898
Your mind couldn't process all
those equations at once.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.528
Give it a little time.

08:13.619 --> 08:16.235
( explosion )

08:16.330 --> 08:17.661
Aeryn:
That's not good.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.409
Man, that one was closer.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.093
Alcar:
Who are you?

08:37.184 --> 08:40.676
Merely commerce traders,
seeking repairs for our ship.

08:40.771 --> 08:43.513
This is some sort of
Peacekeeper ship.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.768
Tell no lies.

08:46.652 --> 08:49.189
Are you a Peacekeeper?

08:49.279 --> 08:51.361
What is your rank?

08:51.448 --> 08:53.188
lam...

08:53.283 --> 08:56.195
I am not a Peacekeeper.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.446
l have no rank.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.120
How did you get this ship?

09:00.207 --> 09:02.072
I will tell you.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.374
He stole it.
-What?

09:04.461 --> 09:06.668
Uh, he was a captain but
now he's a renegade.

09:06.755 --> 09:09.212
He stole this Leviathan mutant
from the Peacekeepers,

09:09.299 --> 09:11.676
and now they want him dead.
They want all of us dead.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.842
Who are you?

09:13.929 --> 09:16.466
I'm a Banik slave. His slave.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.673
And I hate him.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.928
He brought me on board this
ship to help him fix it.

09:21.019 --> 09:24.227
Kill him and make me
your slave.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.305
Kill him?

09:26.400 --> 09:29.107
Is this is the truth?

09:29.194 --> 09:31.731
Yes, yes! Every word!

09:32.239 --> 09:34.195
(moaning)

09:35.951 --> 09:39.193
Make this ship operational.

09:39.288 --> 09:43.998
And I'll grant you
an easy death.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.622
You sure this thing's unlocked?
I'm not feeling any smarter.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.419
Give it some time.

09:49.506 --> 09:53.294
All right, but something better
kick in before that
Dreadnought gets here.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.250
It will.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.712
This may require an
oscillation damper.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.384
Here ya go. Use that.

10:04.188 --> 10:05.143
Perfect.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.186
Thanks. Why'd you
pick this one?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.980
You said you wanted an
oscillation damper.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.649
I figured you could modify
the rillon valve.

10:11.737 --> 10:13.602
I can.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.562
But how did you know that?

10:21.330 --> 10:23.412
That's cool.

10:31.673 --> 10:32.879
(gasps )

10:32.966 --> 10:34.627
(explosions)

10:42.726 --> 10:44.557
(moaning)

10:50.484 --> 10:51.644
Oh!

10:52.444 --> 10:54.184
What... what happened?

10:54.279 --> 10:55.940
What happened to you?

10:56.031 --> 10:57.692
Piece of shrapnel.

10:57.783 --> 10:58.898
Why are we still here?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.323
Where the yotz is Talyn?

11:00.410 --> 11:01.786
Don't know.
The comms are still out.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.155
Here, I'll take over.

11:03.247 --> 11:05.238
No, no, you're still mobile.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.914
I'm not. Just bring me food!

11:08.001 --> 11:09.707
You want to eat now?

11:09.795 --> 11:12.707
Bring me food, and
I'll keep going.

11:12.798 --> 11:15.164
Crichton:
It's starting to make sense.
It's all coming together.

11:15.259 --> 11:18.217
Jack:
Well, we still need an inversion
loop, and I don't have the right parts to build it.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.759
Sure you do.

11:19.847 --> 11:23.135
Use this to set up the
resonance, and this to flip it.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.391
( chuckles ):
Good.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.309
What an elegant solution.

11:28.397 --> 11:30.888
I couldn't accomplish this
without you.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.224
Jack, what the hell are
we building?

11:34.611 --> 11:36.192
A Displacement Engine.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.646
Yeah, and whatever it is will
take out a Scarran Dreadnought.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.319
Yes.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.025
And then?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.155
What do you mean?

11:44.246 --> 11:46.908
I mean, how far are you
gonna take this?

11:46.999 --> 11:51.288
Is this the end, or are you
going to try to put all the
toothpaste back in the tube?

11:52.838 --> 11:54.248
I doubt that's possible.

11:54.339 --> 11:57.001
But you're going to give it the
old college try, aren't ya?

11:57.092 --> 12:01.836
You're going to kill me,
Furlow and Aeryn.

12:03.599 --> 12:06.215
Aeryn poses no threat.

12:06.602 --> 12:08.183
Furlow?

12:08.270 --> 12:10.056
l'm uncertain.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.346
And what about me?

12:17.237 --> 12:20.195
I no longer doubt your
intentions, John.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.041
Coils are almost ready.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.117
What's the tolerance?

12:34.212 --> 12:36.123
Lurg three.
Close as I can get 'em.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.499
Should be close enough.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.582
Rygel's keeping the Charrids
at bay, but barely.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.337
Where do we stand?
-We're almost done.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.964
I need a quarter arn.

12:43.055 --> 12:46.092
l have to install the partanium
and build the emitter array.

12:46.183 --> 12:49.767
I want you to stay clear of this
hangar until I give the okay.

12:49.853 --> 12:53.437
I don't want you exposed
to this radiation.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.310
Well, I can check the area
outside the hangar doors again.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.437
You want some company?
-Sure.

13:04.368 --> 13:06.154
Aeryn:
I still can't raise Talyn.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.656
Crichton:
And the Dreadnought is due
in what, two more arns?

13:08.747 --> 13:11.739
We may not even have
that much time.
-You think they're in trouble?

13:11.833 --> 13:15.667
Or Scarrans will send an
advance scout unit before
committing the main force.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.290
Like what? A Prowler detail?

13:17.381 --> 13:19.918
Anything from a one-man stealth
capsule to a full fighter squad.

13:20.008 --> 13:24.297
But with Talyn blinded, they
may be upon him before
he can Starburst away.

13:24.388 --> 13:27.801
Well, hell. We didn't have
enough to worry about.

13:56.253 --> 13:57.584
Furlow!

13:58.714 --> 14:01.581
Here you go. This all you need?

14:01.675 --> 14:02.881
Yeah.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.299
This case could be stronger.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.967
Eeh...

14:06.054 --> 14:09.512
Don't worry, I haven't initiated
the partanium reaction yet.

14:09.599 --> 14:13.183
Uh-huh. When you do, just in
case something goes wrong,

14:13.270 --> 14:16.888
where is the emergency
shutdown control?

14:16.982 --> 14:18.438
There isn't one.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.562
Once the device is activated,
you can't shut it down.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.186
Then what does it do?

14:24.281 --> 14:25.566
Blow up?

14:25.657 --> 14:27.488
You building a bomb here, Jack?

14:27.576 --> 14:29.191
Not at all.

14:29.286 --> 14:32.653
After 1.4 arns, a meltdown
occurs and destroys the device.

14:32.748 --> 14:37.287
So, you only got one shot at
whatever it is this thing does.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.288
That's all I should need.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.128
l'm launching soon.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.001
You're flying the module?

14:44.092 --> 14:45.172
Yes.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.796
Does Johnny know about this?

14:46.887 --> 14:49.128
No, and I don't want to have an
argument with him about it.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.838
As soon as he and Aeryn give
the all-clear from the outside,

14:51.933 --> 14:53.548
I want you to open those
hangar doors.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.304
Now, go on.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.555
Well, go on. I'm about
to start the reactor.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.436
I can't let you do that, Jack.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.857
Back off.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.200
This is the only chance we have
to keep the Scarrans from...

15:09.284 --> 15:12.776
From paying me a lot of money.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.236
Now...

15:16.541 --> 15:20.250
You ain't goin' nowhere.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.377
(thud)

15:35.352 --> 15:37.263
(whistles sharply)

15:44.694 --> 15:47.106
You had to kill him?

15:47.197 --> 15:49.279
He would have made a
useful prize.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.732
You think he'd have cooperated?

15:51.827 --> 15:53.283
Forget it.

15:53.370 --> 15:55.986
This, my friend, is the prize.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.037
Ha... What is it?

15:58.125 --> 16:00.457
Well, it's a, um...

16:00.544 --> 16:02.626
I don't exactly know
what it is,

16:02.712 --> 16:07.581
but I do know that our friend
here seemed to think that it
could kill a Dreadnought.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.292
Ha, it hardly seems finished.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.719
No, sure it is.
Just a little here...
there... ya know.

16:12.806 --> 16:18.096
Anyway, you know, I really
think we oughtta scoot while
we got the chance.

16:18.186 --> 16:19.392
Agreed.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.222
Excuse me, ah, where
are you going?

16:23.316 --> 16:27.730
Cause, ah, see, I... I'm the
one who's flying the Module
here, not... not you.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.937
Incorrect.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.867
No, come on, you know.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.662
I need you guys to cover me
when I retreat, and...

16:39.749 --> 16:41.250
No.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.746
See, we don't trust you
any longer.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.623
What?

16:45.714 --> 16:50.299
'Cause you've allowed
too many of us to die.

16:50.385 --> 16:53.252
I had to do that, you know?
Don't you get it?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.428
If they knew I was on
your side, then...

16:55.515 --> 16:59.849
We're not sure whose
side you're on!

16:59.936 --> 17:03.599
I will fly the module alone.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.898
You, reattach that to
the module!

17:09.404 --> 17:10.484
Hm!

17:12.199 --> 17:13.439
(gunfire)

17:13.533 --> 17:15.034
Jack!

17:16.620 --> 17:18.360
Furlow:
Charrids.

17:18.455 --> 17:20.286
They snuck in.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.364
I nailed them, but...

17:23.043 --> 17:24.658
They got Jack.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.836
No. No, no, no, no.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.143
It's okay.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.893
It's okay. Jack.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.528
I'll finish it.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.025
We'll keep your Ancients
safe and sound.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.933
What happened?
How did they get in?

18:24.354 --> 18:26.185
You tell me.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.685
I thought you and the short one
were supposed to be guarding
the place.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.232
Well, what about your
supposed booby traps?

18:31.319 --> 18:32.183
What about them?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.564
I think you should check them.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.146
Fine. lwill.

18:36.241 --> 18:40.029
John, we have two arns at
most before the Dreadnought
gets here.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.735
Can you operate this device?

18:42.455 --> 18:44.286
It's not finished.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.989
Can you finish it?

18:46.084 --> 18:47.540
I'm not even sure what it does.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.163
Well, you have to.

18:49.254 --> 18:54.374
I... I thought that the
knowledge was starting
to open up in you.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.301
Maybe I'll pick it up
as I go along.

19:05.729 --> 19:08.266
Stark:
Talyn's senses are
beginning to recover.

19:08.356 --> 19:11.018
Once they do, he can target the
Scarran and shoot him.

19:11.109 --> 19:13.441
It will take heavy and
prolonged fire to bring
down a Scarran.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.314
He won't just stand there...
-Work! Work!

19:15.405 --> 19:19.694
I can find no Pilot on board
this Leviathan.

19:19.784 --> 19:22.116
There isn't one.
It doesn't need it.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.114
There is a direct interface.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.285
Stark!

19:25.373 --> 19:27.284
Let him speak.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.036
Shut up!

19:29.127 --> 19:32.961
The best way to operate
this ship is via a
Neural Transponder.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.333
Look.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.921
Here's the socket.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.297
You see?

19:40.388 --> 19:43.300
His transponder was damaged
so we had to remove it.

19:43.391 --> 19:46.428
But the ship can construct
a replacement.

19:46.519 --> 19:51.309
You will have the ship
make one for me.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.900
Yes, yes.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.066
Whatever you say.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.406
I had to tell him.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.655
He would have forced it
out of you anyway.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.282
You did well.

20:06.373 --> 20:10.207
Instruct Talyn to prepare
a Neural Transponder.

20:10.293 --> 20:11.453
Two, in fact.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.579
Two?

20:12.670 --> 20:15.878
One for me and one
for the Scarran.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.290
( beeping )

20:26.601 --> 20:28.102
It's gonna work.

20:28.186 --> 20:30.177
It's all coming together.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.354
I got it.

20:38.530 --> 20:41.693
Aeryn, I got it.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.193
It all fits. Everything fits.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.945
I... l... I know how
to do this.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.199
I can build this thing.
I know what it does.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.030
Can it destroy the Dreadnought?

20:53.086 --> 20:54.872
Um...

20:55.797 --> 20:57.879
It could destroy a planet.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.841
Jack.

21:03.221 --> 21:06.463
All right, he's built it so it
self-destructs after one use.

21:06.558 --> 21:09.641
That's... that's good.
That's smart.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.979
Big hole in the sewage outlet.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.145
Think I might have found
where the Charrids got in.

21:14.232 --> 21:15.597
Did you seal it?

21:15.692 --> 21:17.774
With what?

21:19.154 --> 21:20.394
I'll seal it.

21:20.488 --> 21:22.194
(mocking tone ):
I'll seal it.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.445
Feeble Sebacean.

21:26.536 --> 21:33.749
You believe that even with
vessels like this, you can
defeat Scarrans?

21:36.254 --> 21:37.960
Slave.

21:40.008 --> 21:42.090
The Neural Transponder?

21:42.177 --> 21:43.838
Soon. Nearly finished. Soon.

21:43.928 --> 21:48.012
It will give me absolute
control of the ship?

21:48.099 --> 21:49.305
Yes, yes.

21:49.392 --> 21:51.383
You will think as one.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.515
Assist your captain.

21:54.606 --> 21:56.221
Yes, yes.

21:56.316 --> 21:59.149
How many other people
have this weapon?

21:59.235 --> 22:00.816
No one.

22:00.904 --> 22:03.190
That's right. Gettin' the idea?

22:03.281 --> 22:04.987
Elucitin capacitor.

22:06.242 --> 22:10.281
See, ah, we can sell it to
everyone as deterrents.

22:10.371 --> 22:13.613
Give it to no one and charge
'em to maintain the balance.

22:13.708 --> 22:19.499
Or, of course, we could just
keep it ourselves and find a
peaceful application.

22:20.632 --> 22:24.341
Furlow, is it always
about the money?

22:26.638 --> 22:28.299
Is there anything else?

22:28.389 --> 22:31.347
I mean, how much sex
can you have?

22:31.434 --> 22:34.392
I don't know.
I haven't maxed out yet.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.312
The Scarrans have your data.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.890
That's a blueprint that
has to be destroyed.

22:40.985 --> 22:47.606
Okay, so we use this box to
stop 'em, but later,
we talk business.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.284
You help me and I will make you
Miss 21st Century Wormhole.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.157
Outstanding.

22:53.248 --> 22:55.113
Now, what'd ya need?

22:55.208 --> 22:57.915
Clear a launch path.
Get rid of that crap.

22:58.002 --> 23:00.209
Comin' right up.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.163
Tight fit through the
exit portals.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.249
Shield doors don't open
all the way.

23:05.343 --> 23:10.337
You better go eyeball the angle
or you'll shear off a
wingtip for sure.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.967
All right.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.436
So...

23:19.524 --> 23:21.230
partners?

23:22.193 --> 23:23.399
Partners.

23:32.328 --> 23:34.910
There's still plenty of
them out there.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.911
Enough of them to squeeze
us into a crossfire.

23:39.002 --> 23:40.617
Why haven't they?

23:41.421 --> 23:42.786
Furlow?

23:45.550 --> 23:48.633
(engine revving)

23:48.720 --> 23:50.176
Furlow!

23:50.263 --> 23:52.345
Come on in, John.

23:54.142 --> 23:57.225
Around the front, so I don't
have to twist my neck.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.893
This is a big mistake.

24:02.984 --> 24:06.818
If you wanna save your life,
you're gonna have to cooperate.

24:06.904 --> 24:11.364
I know it looks great on you
but... two fingers. Pistol.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.618
And, uh, goggles.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.414
Drop 'em.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.087
Now step on 'em.

24:29.677 --> 24:31.338
(crunching)

24:33.681 --> 24:36.388
There's a Scarran Dreadnought
on the way.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.182
Where you gonna go, Furlow?

24:38.269 --> 24:39.679
To meet 'em.

24:39.771 --> 24:41.432
To save my life.

24:41.522 --> 24:45.231
You know, when the Scarrans get
this baby they'll go away.

24:45.318 --> 24:46.808
Don't do this.

24:46.903 --> 24:50.191
Wormhole full of reasons
why I should.

24:51.616 --> 24:54.904
And no upside in crossing
the Scarrans.

24:58.081 --> 25:00.572
I got to go while I got cover.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.282
Don't stand in my way, John.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.333
(engine revving)

25:05.129 --> 25:06.539
Aeryn!

25:20.311 --> 25:23.223
Aeryn:
Why have they stopped shelling?

25:23.314 --> 25:25.350
What are we missing?

25:25.817 --> 25:27.227
What?

25:29.112 --> 25:30.227
What's that?

25:30.321 --> 25:31.231
It's John.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.404
Frell!
-Cover us.

25:36.452 --> 25:37.862
John!

25:43.209 --> 25:44.710
Furlow's with the Scarrans.

25:44.794 --> 25:47.160
That would explain why the
Charrids have stayed on
the perimeter.

25:47.255 --> 25:49.211
Explains a lot of things.

25:52.301 --> 25:53.882
You know, we are running
out of time.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.551
We still got time.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.386
You know, this new knowledge
you've got in your head?

26:01.477 --> 26:04.344
Yeah.
-Can you use it to get home?

26:04.439 --> 26:07.806
Yeah.
-Let's do what we have to do
here and then we'll go.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.318
What the...

26:13.406 --> 26:14.612
Frell.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.084
(weak electric crackling )

26:30.757 --> 26:32.088
You'll never guess.

26:32.175 --> 26:34.587
It doesn't work?
-No!

26:34.677 --> 26:38.886
How the hell can we have the
only gun on the planet
that doesn't work?!

26:38.973 --> 26:40.804
It's your fault!
-My fault?

26:40.892 --> 26:43.634
Well you know if I was here
on my own, it would be
working right now.

26:43.728 --> 26:47.095
Well I hope you got a plan,
baby, 'cause I'm fresh
out of ideas.

26:49.025 --> 26:51.607
It's a plan. He has to
follow our tracks.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.776
All right, you get Furlow.
I've got your back.

26:53.863 --> 26:54.898
I love you.

26:54.989 --> 26:56.195
Love you.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.376
(engine revving)

27:43.746 --> 27:45.407
( softly ):
Run away.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.161
Be smart.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.369
( louder ):
Run away.

27:59.262 --> 28:01.048
(sighs)

28:01.514 --> 28:03.175
Should'a run.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.686
(grunting)

28:36.966 --> 28:39.878
Furlow:
You know, you shoulda git
while you had the chance.

28:39.969 --> 28:41.630
You should have done
the right thing.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.382
How well you know me?

28:43.472 --> 28:45.303
You think I like the Scarrans?

28:45.391 --> 28:48.053
They sent in the Charrids,
slaughtered my crew,
tortured me...

28:48.144 --> 28:50.556
You think | faked
all my wounds?

28:50.646 --> 28:52.978
Turn around and walk away.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.646
I'd rather be dead, John.

28:54.734 --> 28:55.974
Too old to start over.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.274
Got nothing left.

28:57.361 --> 28:59.773
Won't leave without that.

28:59.864 --> 29:01.980
Furlow, I don't have
time for this.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.490
Oh, damn!

29:09.081 --> 29:10.241
Ready.

29:10.333 --> 29:13.245
Where is the Neural
Transponder?

29:13.336 --> 29:16.544
Why do I not yet have
control of this vessel?

29:16.631 --> 29:18.667
Because,because,
because I'm still...

29:18.758 --> 29:21.170
Ah, these controls!
See for yourself.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.297
Are you subverting my commands?

29:24.388 --> 29:25.252
No, truly...

29:25.348 --> 29:26.383
Scarran.

29:26.474 --> 29:28.760
I subvert your commands.

29:28.851 --> 29:32.639
You deny me the Transponder?

29:32.730 --> 29:34.311
Do you still want it?

29:34.398 --> 29:36.684
Without delay.

29:36.776 --> 29:39.563
Then... you shall have it.

29:39.654 --> 29:40.643
( groans )

29:40.738 --> 29:42.649
Talyn! Fire!

29:44.909 --> 29:46.649
( screaming )

29:49.246 --> 29:50.952
E64 “F E”;

29:51.040 --> 29:52.496
Get down!

29:59.465 --> 30:02.582
(groaning)

30:05.680 --> 30:07.090
Thank you.

30:07.181 --> 30:09.388
It may not happen again.

30:10.226 --> 30:12.057
Crichton:
Furlow, look.

30:12.144 --> 30:15.227
The device. It's active.

30:16.023 --> 30:18.309
You can't shut it off.

30:18.401 --> 30:20.232
By the time you get it to the
Scarrans, it'll be useless.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.231
It'll be slag.
-Fre|l!

30:23.322 --> 30:27.907
I can't deactivate it, but you
got to let me use it to take
out the Dreadnought.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.530
Casing's open, John.

30:29.620 --> 30:30.826
I can close it.

30:30.913 --> 30:33.199
Furlow:
Uh-uh. It's too late already.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.155
The reaction's building
too fast.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.242
I think we both better
get outta here.

30:38.129 --> 30:39.289
No, you go.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.211
Don't be the hero, John.

30:41.298 --> 30:44.256
Always be the one to walk away
while the hero dies.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.334
That's my motto.

30:58.566 --> 31:00.352
Okay.

31:10.578 --> 31:12.569
Okay, one...

31:13.122 --> 31:14.328
Two...

31:14.790 --> 31:17.327
Three.

31:17.418 --> 31:20.034
(warbling electronic tone)
( screams )

31:50.034 --> 31:51.899
You okay?

31:52.411 --> 31:55.323
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.661
We have to hurry.

32:01.504 --> 32:04.337
Crichton. Aeryn. Rygel.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.799
What is your status?

32:05.883 --> 32:08.841
Frelled. Mivonks on a plate.
Frelled.

32:08.928 --> 32:12.295
What's your status?
-I am partially sighted.

32:12.389 --> 32:15.301
Talyn has recovered
sufficiently to attempt
Starburst.

32:15.392 --> 32:18.054
Well, pick me up and let's go!

32:18.145 --> 32:19.180
Crichton? Aeryn?

32:19.271 --> 32:22.138
Crichton:
Crais. We got one shot at this.

32:22.233 --> 32:25.020
The, uh, Displacement Engine
will take out the Scarrans.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.193
You need to pick up Sparky and
get the hell out of here.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.315
Yes. Starburst immediately.

32:29.406 --> 32:30.316
No.

32:30.407 --> 32:31.863
It is unanimous.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.282
We stay.

32:33.369 --> 32:35.405
Oh dammit, Crais, knock it off.

32:35.496 --> 32:37.452
You're gonna make me
start liking you.

32:37.540 --> 32:38.996
Is there anything we can do?

32:39.083 --> 32:41.790
Yeah. It would be helpful to
have the Dreadnought

32:41.877 --> 32:45.210
directly in line with the
mouth of the wormhole.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.412
What wormhole?

32:46.507 --> 32:48.247
The one I'm about to rustle up.

32:50.344 --> 32:53.381
We will attempt to lure them.
Good fortune.

32:54.223 --> 32:56.054
John? Are you hurt?

32:56.142 --> 32:57.598
No. No, I'm fine.

32:57.685 --> 32:59.175
What happened?
What did she do to you?

32:59.270 --> 33:01.352
No, she didn't do anything.
-What's the matter?

33:01.438 --> 33:03.053
She didn't...

33:04.817 --> 33:07.058
What is the matter?

33:09.238 --> 33:10.774
Radiation.

33:11.574 --> 33:13.735
Massive radiation.

33:16.704 --> 33:19.286
I couldn't... help it.

33:20.416 --> 33:22.327
I couldn't stop it.

33:24.253 --> 33:27.040
There has to be something
you can do.

33:27.131 --> 33:28.587
No, l have to finish this.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.130
You're finished here.
I'm flying the mission.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.424
Aeryn, you don't know
what to do.
-You will talk me through it.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.048
You will get help and you will
not argue with me on this one.

33:35.139 --> 33:38.723
Dammit! This is not something
I can coach you through.

33:38.809 --> 33:43.473
It's half intuition, it's half
feel and I know it like
I invented it.

33:43.564 --> 33:45.976
So it's your life for
everyone else's.

33:49.111 --> 33:50.567
And you're different? How?

33:50.654 --> 33:53.270
I'm different because
I love you.

33:57.661 --> 34:01.245
Then you know I have to do this.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.336
I'm coming back.

34:28.651 --> 34:33.236
Scarran Dreadnought, this is
Captain Bialar Crais.

34:33.322 --> 34:35.153
Peacekeepeh

34:35.241 --> 34:40.781
Approach any closer, you will
be engaged and destroyed.

34:42.623 --> 34:44.909
They must be terrified.

34:56.387 --> 34:57.843
(sighs)

35:01.308 --> 35:03.549
(sighs)

35:03.644 --> 35:06.602
Crais, where is it? I can't see
that damn Dreadnought anywhere.

35:06.689 --> 35:09.897
Closing fast on an intercept
vector with Talyn.

35:09.984 --> 35:13.226
But, Crichton, there is no
wormhole to maneuver them.

35:14.989 --> 35:19.198
Oh, there's my flare.
Mama Crichton's baby boy
makin' wormholes.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.293
Stark:
Close... Close...

35:29.378 --> 35:31.289
Very close.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.094
(electronic beeping )

35:41.181 --> 35:42.170
This is...

35:42.266 --> 35:44.177
We're being targeted.

35:51.358 --> 35:53.019
What was that?

35:53.110 --> 35:55.351
I destroyed Furlow's lab.

35:59.575 --> 36:02.282
There's nothing left.

36:02.369 --> 36:05.361
Okay, Displacement Engine,
time to displace.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.168
Scarran Dreadnought.

36:13.255 --> 36:18.124
Withhold your fire.
We surrender.
I repeat, we surrender.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.470
Talyn, stand down your
weaponry.

36:20.554 --> 36:22.761
Make them believe.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.839
Draw them in.

36:28.896 --> 36:30.386
John.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.021
I'm almost there.

36:43.619 --> 36:46.907
The wormhole is touching
the star.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.737
It's touching the star.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.165
Okay, Jack. This one's for you.

37:29.415 --> 37:32.122
I have no prayer for that.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.378
John, are you...

37:44.346 --> 37:46.758
Crichton:
Yeah. Baby, I'm...

37:46.849 --> 37:49.010
I'm still here.

37:52.855 --> 37:55.221
Told you I'd come back.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.948
( coughs )

38:27.931 --> 38:30.183
The...

38:30.267 --> 38:34.385
radiation sickness treatments
from Talyn's emergency
kit should...

38:34.480 --> 38:36.721
Relax.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.397
It was a big hit.

38:39.485 --> 38:41.601
Nothing to be done.

38:42.571 --> 38:44.983
And I hate long goodbyes.

38:48.202 --> 38:54.289
Your sacrifice does not go
unnoted, Commander.

38:54.374 --> 38:56.035
Crais...

38:58.337 --> 38:59.918
You...

39:01.465 --> 39:04.502
find the better part
of yourself.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.381
You...

39:08.472 --> 39:10.963
have to take care of them.

39:15.437 --> 39:17.644
|wi||.

39:21.652 --> 39:24.143
hope you can believe that.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.317
Goodbye, Crichton.

39:37.543 --> 39:41.877
Hey, hey, hey, Sparky.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.843
They say it's not good.

39:51.098 --> 39:53.180
Sparky, come here.

39:54.351 --> 39:56.558
My stuff.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.390
You can't have it.

40:00.107 --> 40:03.349
(laughing)

40:04.194 --> 40:06.150
( coughs )

40:06.238 --> 40:10.197
It will be hard not to
think of you.

40:10.284 --> 40:12.696
I'm gonna miss you, Dominar.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.242
(moans)

40:22.254 --> 40:23.619
Stark.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.876
It's okay.

41:18.352 --> 41:20.468
I'm very angry.

41:22.356 --> 41:24.517
Me, too.

41:26.318 --> 41:28.775
We had good times.

41:30.364 --> 41:33.322
I wouldn't change it
for the world.

41:37.954 --> 41:40.206
You made me...

41:40.290 --> 41:42.246
a better person.

41:44.378 --> 41:46.664
That wasn't hard.

41:54.179 --> 41:57.387
I love you. So much.

41:59.643 --> 42:02.305
I love you.

42:08.318 --> 42:10.730
I would have gone to Earth.

42:14.574 --> 42:19.159
I'm sorry you never got
to meet my dad.

42:19.246 --> 42:22.409
My real dad, I mean.

42:23.375 --> 42:26.037
Sorry I never met your dad.

42:28.839 --> 42:30.875
I'm sorry about a lot of things.

42:30.966 --> 42:32.581
No.

42:32.676 --> 42:35.713
Don't be. I don't want
you to go that way.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.178
I won't.

42:42.519 --> 42:43.884
Huh.

42:43.979 --> 42:45.344
What?

42:47.733 --> 42:49.940
They say...

42:50.026 --> 42:55.692
it's a lucky or an unambitious
man who goes when he's ready.

42:58.034 --> 43:00.491
That said,

43:02.247 --> 43:04.909
Scorpius is gone.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.657
I'm at peace.

43:10.964 --> 43:13.171
I don't hurt.

43:15.886 --> 43:18.047
x 1: 1:
“.17

43:18.638 --> 43:21.220
I did some good things.

43:23.852 --> 43:26.218
I'm proud of my life.

43:30.984 --> 43:33.225
And I'm with you.

44:05.811 --> 44:08.393
Don't worry about me.

44:12.234 --> 44:15.317
I've never felt better.
