01:37.200 --> 01:38.926
I was only clipped
by the car.

01:39.064 --> 01:40.514
- It's my shoulder.
- Alright, Addison.

01:40.652 --> 01:42.309
We can only do it
- until we fully assess you.
- Aah!

01:42.447 --> 01:44.104
Okay, sorry, sorry.
- Okay, okay, okay, sorry.
- My shoulder. Ow!

01:44.242 --> 01:46.520
Bed 5.

01:46.658 --> 01:48.246
I need an update
from Chief of Security.

01:48.384 --> 01:49.695
- Bailey!
- Yeah, I'm still here.

01:49.833 --> 01:52.250
Bailey.
Go check on Tia.

01:52.388 --> 01:53.043
- Someone page X-ray.
- Come on, come on.

01:53.182 --> 01:55.045
- I'm on it.
- Go.

Thank God.
Proof of life.

02:03.675 --> 02:06.229
They said you were handling
clinic patients...

02:06.367 --> 02:07.679
I wasn't out there.
...and so I called
and you didn't answer

02:07.817 --> 02:09.025
and my mind
- went to a place.
- I'm sorry, I just--

02:09.163 --> 02:11.131
Hey, um...

02:11.269 --> 02:13.374
It's all good.
Question answered.

02:13.512 --> 02:15.100
- I've gotta get back.
- Yeah, of course.

02:15.238 --> 02:16.446
Okay, Yasuda, let's type
and cross for blood.

02:16.584 --> 02:17.965
Call the blood bank
and tell them to activate

02:18.103 --> 02:19.553
massive transfusion protocol.

02:19.691 --> 02:20.692
On it. Okay.

02:20.830 --> 02:22.556
What do you see, Adams?

02:22.694 --> 02:24.040
Free fluid in the perihepatic
and perisplenic areas.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.455
We need to get her
to CT.

02:25.593 --> 02:27.112
Not until I see
the baby's tracing.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.631
I wish I wasn't a doctor.

02:28.769 --> 02:30.736
I wish I didn't understand
how bad this is.

02:30.874 --> 02:32.566
We're doing
everything we can.

02:32.704 --> 02:34.913
- Connor.
- Who's Connor?

02:35.051 --> 02:37.260
C-Connor, that's his name.

02:37.398 --> 02:39.642
A-After my father-in-law.

02:39.780 --> 02:42.576
Dr. Wilson, promise me that
you're not gonna deliver him.

02:42.714 --> 02:44.336
It's too early. His lungs
are not mature enough yet.

02:44.474 --> 02:47.097
He's not ready.
He needs more time.

02:47.236 --> 02:50.308
You and I both know
he needs more time.

02:50.446 --> 02:51.930
Please.

02:52.068 --> 02:53.311
ACB has been activated,
blood is on the way.

02:53.449 --> 02:54.760
I need you to take
some deep breaths.

02:54.898 --> 02:56.762
Okay, repetitive late decels.
The baby's in distress.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.937
We need to get her upstairs
- right now.
- Yeah.

02:59.075 --> 02:59.903
Damn it, V-fib.

03:00.041 --> 03:01.940
Let's get a crash cart.

03:02.078 --> 03:04.253
Okay, let's turn her on her left
side and get ready to intubate.

03:04.391 --> 03:06.945
Let's drop some etomidate
and succs.

03:07.083 --> 03:09.706
- Here's a cardiac board.
- Good girl.

03:09.844 --> 03:13.572
Alright, and I'm coming
around to do compressions.

03:13.710 --> 03:14.815
Okay.

03:14.953 --> 03:15.919
Charge to 200, okay?

03:16.057 --> 03:17.714
Clear!

03:17.852 --> 03:20.786
Okay, alert the O.R.

03:20.924 --> 03:23.962
Again.
Charge 200.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.446
You didn't lose consciousness,
get dizzy,

03:25.584 --> 03:27.137
notice
any vision changes?

03:27.276 --> 03:29.623
- I'm fine.
- Left shoulder's dislocated.

03:29.761 --> 03:31.694
We need to reduce it under
sedation and get you an MRI.

03:31.832 --> 03:33.005
I'm fine.
I-- Ow!

03:33.143 --> 03:34.800
I need to help Tia.

03:34.938 --> 03:36.733
She's right next door
and she's got six

03:36.871 --> 03:37.976
very capable doctors
around her.

03:38.114 --> 03:39.736
I'm gonna lift your arm
a little bit.

03:39.874 --> 03:41.738
Ow!

03:41.876 --> 03:43.395
What happened to you?

03:43.533 --> 03:44.810
I was grazed
with a brick.

03:44.948 --> 03:46.053
The one thrown
through the window?

03:46.191 --> 03:48.814
Has anyone ruled out
a head injury?

03:48.952 --> 03:50.402
Let's go.
I'm fine.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.266
People need to
stop saying that.

03:52.404 --> 03:53.750
I'm coming back.
Ready for the ambu bag.

03:53.888 --> 03:56.822
Ooh.
Just pop it back in.

03:56.960 --> 03:57.892
Not without some sedation.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.998
Just pop it back in,
damn it!

04:00.136 --> 04:01.586
Griffith,
stand behind her.

04:01.724 --> 04:03.484
Stabilize her shoulder.

04:03.622 --> 04:04.796
Charge to 300.

04:04.934 --> 04:06.315
Okay.
Clear!

04:06.453 --> 04:08.386
One, two--

04:08.524 --> 04:10.250
Aah! F--

04:12.079 --> 04:14.495
Okay.

04:14.633 --> 04:16.808
Okay.
Griffith, come with me.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.745
And clear!

04:22.883 --> 04:24.091
What's happening?

04:24.229 --> 04:25.161
No variability
on fetal monitor.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.507
It's category three tracing.

04:26.645 --> 04:28.406
How long?

04:28.544 --> 04:29.683
How long?!

04:29.821 --> 04:31.098
Almost two minutes.

04:31.236 --> 04:33.203
We tried multiple rounds
of shock, epi, and boluses.

04:33.342 --> 04:34.860
She is bleeding out
through her abdomen.

04:34.998 --> 04:36.448
CPR's not gonna work.

04:36.586 --> 04:38.070
Go ahead and prep the abdomen
for a C-section.

04:38.208 --> 04:39.693
- Addison.
- Gown and glove me.

04:39.831 --> 04:42.868
That baby is not gonna survive
in the uterus any longer.

04:43.006 --> 04:44.456
We've got
to get the baby out.

04:44.594 --> 04:45.630
I'm not gonna let that person
behind the wheel

04:45.768 --> 04:47.735
take two lives
out of this family.

04:47.873 --> 04:49.047
Okay.

04:49.185 --> 04:51.360
Let's get an ex lap tray
and some towels.

04:51.498 --> 04:53.707
Hang two units of blood.
Page the NICU.

04:53.845 --> 04:56.606
We need an incubator and
a resuscitation team down here.

04:56.744 --> 04:59.091
Okay, I'll get gowned and
gloved. Adams, take over.

04:59.229 --> 05:01.611
Alright,
get the lap pads ready.

05:01.749 --> 05:03.095
I'm so sorry.

05:06.271 --> 05:07.721
Okay,
we need to move faster.

05:07.859 --> 05:09.723
Come on, come on.

05:09.861 --> 05:11.207
Are we ready?

05:11.345 --> 05:12.898
10-blade.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.040
Stopping
compressions.

05:17.178 --> 05:18.559
Incision.

05:41.824 --> 05:44.033
I'm going to extend
the incision.

05:44.171 --> 05:46.415
Suction.
Let's give another
round of epi.

05:46.553 --> 05:48.209
Dr. Yasuda, break's over.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.972
If they don't need you in there,
go do intake on bed 4.

05:52.110 --> 05:54.561
I need more retraction.

05:54.699 --> 05:56.114
Okay, there's bleeding
in the liver and spleen.

05:56.252 --> 05:57.598
- Lap pads.
- Isn't she already gone?

05:57.736 --> 05:59.117
Why are we packing her--'Cause we don't stop

05:59.255 --> 06:00.014
until we do everything
that we can, okay?

06:00.152 --> 06:01.084
More lap pads.

06:01.222 --> 06:02.258
How we doing, DeLuca?

06:02.396 --> 06:04.364
I've got him.
He's out.

06:04.502 --> 06:06.296
Wilson, cut the cord. Yep.

06:06.435 --> 06:08.782
Oxygen mask and prepare
for suction and intubation.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.887
Hey, baby boy.
Hang on for us.

06:11.025 --> 06:13.027
Okay, restarting
chest compressions.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.616
Okay, hang two units of blood
- and push one of epi.
- Come on, Tia.

06:15.754 --> 06:17.342
Come on.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.689
Come on, Tia.

06:19.827 --> 06:21.381
Come on.

06:24.522 --> 06:25.454
There!
- Wow.

06:25.592 --> 06:26.558
Okay.

06:26.696 --> 06:28.491
Oh, thank God.

06:28.629 --> 06:29.975
Let's get her to the O.R.
while she still has a pulse.

06:30.113 --> 06:31.632
And can somebody get me
her husband's number?

06:31.770 --> 06:33.254
I'm on it.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.084
Okay, I'm intubating
the baby now.

06:35.222 --> 06:37.086
Griffith, make sure
NICU knows we're coming.

06:37.224 --> 06:38.467
Yes,
Dr. Montgomery.

06:42.056 --> 06:44.404
Essential personnel only.

06:44.542 --> 06:45.819
We're first responders.

06:45.957 --> 06:47.268
You guys got patients
with you?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.236
My wife runs the clinic.
Miranda Bailey.

06:49.374 --> 06:50.548
Our daughter is upstairs
in the daycare.

06:50.686 --> 06:52.135
This entrance is closed.

06:52.273 --> 06:53.654
Dr. Altman!
Teddy!

06:55.622 --> 06:56.485
It's okay.
They're with me.

06:56.623 --> 06:58.003
Essential personnel only.

06:58.141 --> 06:59.419
I'm chief of surgery.
They're essential.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.492
- Have you seen Carina?
- She's in surgery.

07:03.630 --> 07:05.563
- Oh, my God.
- No, she-- she's <i>doing</i> surgery.

07:05.701 --> 07:07.565
She's okay
and Bailey's okay, too.

07:07.703 --> 07:09.359
Oh, thank God.

07:09.498 --> 07:11.016
If anyone else gives you
trouble, just have them page me.

07:11.154 --> 07:12.017
- Alright. Thanks, Teddy.
- Thank you.

07:13.985 --> 07:16.194
This process seems to take
a lot longer

07:16.332 --> 07:17.229
when you're
on the other side of it.

07:17.367 --> 07:19.680
<i>Almost done.</i>

07:19.818 --> 07:23.132
Remember when being a doctor
was considered heroic?

07:23.270 --> 07:25.686
Like firefighters
and teachers?

07:25.824 --> 07:27.377
Who does this?

07:27.516 --> 07:29.414
I mean, who throws bricks
and runs cars into doctors?

07:29.552 --> 07:31.623
Scans are up.

07:31.761 --> 07:33.280
What do you see?

07:33.418 --> 07:37.146
Uh, no bleeding,
no fractures...

07:37.284 --> 07:39.528
<i>No traumatic
brain injuries.</i>

07:39.666 --> 07:40.874
Then can someone get me
out of here

07:41.012 --> 07:42.565
so I can go back to work? <i>Not so fast.</i>

07:42.703 --> 07:44.291
<i>You could be concussed,
so you should go home.</i>

07:44.429 --> 07:45.361
I live alone.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.707
If I go home and fall asleep,

07:46.845 --> 07:48.398
I could die
and no one would know.

07:48.537 --> 07:50.711
<i>Okay, fine, but you need
to be supervised</i>

07:50.849 --> 07:52.402
<i>and undergo regular
neuro checks.</i>

07:52.541 --> 07:53.887
Wha-- I-I don't want
to supervise him.

07:54.025 --> 07:55.336
Well, I don't care.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.407
He can't do any procedures
or scrub in.

07:57.546 --> 07:59.720
Only let him do notes
and patient intake.

07:59.858 --> 08:02.551
And page if he has
any dizziness or headaches.

08:02.689 --> 08:04.553
<i>Hello?</i>

08:04.691 --> 08:05.657
Hello?

08:08.695 --> 08:10.800
Hey.
Hey.

08:10.938 --> 08:12.146
Did you need something?

08:12.284 --> 08:13.734
No, I just wanted
to check in.

08:13.872 --> 08:16.357
Dr. Pierce.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.360
Well, Mr. Lingenfelser's post-op
cardiac index is improving.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.742
I think we can discharge
in the morning.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.848
Okay, that's good.

08:23.986 --> 08:26.298
I was actually
checking on <i>you.</i>

08:26.436 --> 08:28.922
Uh...

08:29.060 --> 08:30.613
Is everyone okay?

08:30.751 --> 08:33.305
Uh, there's a pregnant doctor
who might not be.

08:34.824 --> 08:36.619
I just...

08:36.757 --> 08:40.347
I cannot process this, so I just
need to focus on my patients.

08:40.485 --> 08:42.349
Like, if I keep telling myself
that everything is fine,

08:42.487 --> 08:44.696
then eventually,
that will make it true, right?

08:44.834 --> 08:47.423
Yeah. The world doesn't make
a whole lot of sense right now.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.356
No, it doesn't.

08:49.494 --> 08:51.531
Oh, uh, <i>Sound Science</i>
sent copies of the issue

08:51.669 --> 08:53.291
for the partial heart
transplant feature.

08:53.429 --> 08:54.361
So I left one for you
in the lounge.

08:54.499 --> 08:55.673
Oh.

08:55.811 --> 08:56.881
What did you think?

08:58.745 --> 09:00.022
You didn't read it?

09:00.160 --> 09:02.300
I got paged as soon
as I started it.

09:02.438 --> 09:04.129
But I'm sure
you did great.

09:06.925 --> 09:08.858
Winston.

09:08.996 --> 09:09.963
Yeah?

09:12.034 --> 09:13.553
Thanks for checking in.

09:17.626 --> 09:20.525
"M" as in "Mary", "I" as in
"Igloo", "L" as in "Larry."

09:20.663 --> 09:21.630
Yes, Ms. Anderson.

09:21.768 --> 09:23.321
I have paged Dr. Millin,

09:23.459 --> 09:24.736
but Dr. Yasuda should
have done your intake.

09:24.874 --> 09:25.737
- Max?
- Where did she--

09:25.875 --> 09:26.980
Jules!

09:27.118 --> 09:27.808
What are you doing here?

09:27.946 --> 09:29.327
Being paranoid.

09:29.465 --> 09:31.398
Norma needs
a knee replacement.

09:31.536 --> 09:33.503
Maxine thinks
she's a doctor.

09:33.642 --> 09:35.920
Ms. Douglas,
your knee <i>is</i> very swollen.

09:36.058 --> 09:38.094
You see? I told you.

09:38.232 --> 09:40.476
We heard some doctors
got hit by a car.

09:40.614 --> 09:41.408
Was that you?

09:41.546 --> 09:43.065
No, no.

09:43.203 --> 09:45.515
Uh, I'm okay, but thanks
for your concern.

09:45.654 --> 09:47.241
Ms. Douglas, have you had
a fall recently?

09:47.379 --> 09:49.278
No.
Any history of gout,

09:49.416 --> 09:51.142
rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis?

09:51.280 --> 09:52.488
Unh-unh.
Okay.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.939
Dr. Millin,
page ortho for her knee.

09:55.077 --> 09:57.010
Wait. She won't tell you,
but I will.

09:57.148 --> 09:59.081
It burns when she pees.

09:59.219 --> 10:00.392
Norma!

10:00.530 --> 10:01.670
Max, you have to
say something.

10:01.808 --> 10:03.188
Remember what happened
last time?

10:03.326 --> 10:04.845
Could be another UTI.

10:04.983 --> 10:06.675
I'll get you a cup
for a urinalysis.

10:06.813 --> 10:08.573
Anything else?

10:08.711 --> 10:10.299
Orange spice tea?

10:10.437 --> 10:12.163
- You know the one I like.
- I'll see what I can do.

10:15.753 --> 10:17.271
Your grandma's
a piece of work.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.135
Oh, Max isn't my grandma.
She's my roommate.

10:20.585 --> 10:22.276
<i>How severe
are her injuries?</i>

10:22.414 --> 10:24.140
Uh, we won't know until
we get her into the O.R.,

10:24.278 --> 10:26.108
but your wife has lost
a lot of blood.

10:26.246 --> 10:28.524
<i>Dr. Bailey, I've been married
to a doctor for five years.</i>

10:28.662 --> 10:30.457
<i>I know when you're hedging.</i>

10:30.595 --> 10:32.632
<i>Please just tell me
what's going on.</i>

10:32.770 --> 10:35.876
Okay, uh, Tia went into cardiac
arrest in the trauma bay,

10:36.014 --> 10:39.328
which forced us to have to
perform an emergency C-section.

10:39.466 --> 10:42.227
We have a team resuscitating
the baby as we speak.

10:42.365 --> 10:44.160
<i>The baby?
That's our baby?</i>

10:44.298 --> 10:46.162
Yes. Your baby.
Your-- Your son.

10:46.300 --> 10:47.888
<i>I will be
on the first flight.</i>

10:48.026 --> 10:50.719
<i>Do whatever you have to do
to save them.</i>

10:50.857 --> 10:52.065
<i>Please.</i> You have my word.

10:52.203 --> 10:54.067
<i>Thank you.</i>

10:54.205 --> 10:57.967
Okay, tell reception to keep
an eye out for Mr. Marwood,

10:58.105 --> 10:59.279
and then scrub in.

10:59.417 --> 11:00.211
Will do.

11:07.114 --> 11:09.669
Thank you.

11:15.191 --> 11:16.123
I'm okay.

11:21.646 --> 11:23.510
Umbilical lines are in.

11:23.648 --> 11:25.098
First hurdle's cleared.

11:25.236 --> 11:26.306
What's that?

11:26.444 --> 11:27.790
Getting him here alive.

11:30.241 --> 11:31.380
O2 is dropping.

11:31.518 --> 11:32.588
Heart rate's in the 60s,
falling fast.

11:32.726 --> 11:33.485
Ambu him.

11:41.528 --> 11:43.288
Yeah, breathing's equal
on both sides.

11:43.426 --> 11:45.359
I'm gonna start
chest compressions.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.016
Okay, little man.

11:47.154 --> 11:48.535
When your mama gets out
of surgery,

11:48.673 --> 11:50.986
she's gonna want to see you
on the other side.

11:51.124 --> 11:54.714
She's been through way too much
for you to give up now, okay?

11:54.852 --> 11:57.061
So I am not gonna
let you give up.

11:57.199 --> 11:58.614
Not today.

12:01.997 --> 12:03.619
Sats are improving.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.241
He's back.

12:05.379 --> 12:07.036
Oh, thank God.

12:07.174 --> 12:08.969
- You doing okay over there?
- Yeah.

12:09.107 --> 12:11.247
I think I held my breath
for that entire time.

12:11.385 --> 12:13.629
That was--
Scary?

12:13.767 --> 12:15.735
Abject terror
is more like it.

12:15.873 --> 12:18.289
Welcome to the NICU.

12:29.472 --> 12:32.337
What's the best approach
for dural sutures?

12:32.475 --> 12:33.994
Do <i>you</i> know the best approach
for dural suturing?

12:36.238 --> 12:39.241
Eh, you're fine.
And it's continuous sutures.

12:39.379 --> 12:41.622
Okay.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.348
- I got a question for you.
- Hmm?

12:43.486 --> 12:45.247
Why do you live
with a 90-year-old?

12:45.385 --> 12:47.007
Uh, Maxine is 81,

12:47.145 --> 12:49.285
and I was friends
with her grandson in med school.

12:49.423 --> 12:51.840
She offered to sublet me
her extra room

12:51.978 --> 12:54.187
for a third of what I would pay
anywhere else.

12:54.325 --> 12:56.776
She also makes amazing
matzo ball soup

12:56.914 --> 12:58.294
and I don't have
to worry

12:58.432 --> 12:59.813
about being quiet
when I come home late

12:59.951 --> 13:00.918
because she takes her
hearing aids out at night.

13:01.056 --> 13:02.574
It's a win-win.

13:02.712 --> 13:04.024
Hi.

13:04.162 --> 13:05.957
So, her knee's okay?

13:06.095 --> 13:08.270
According to the X-ray,
there is no sign of a fracture.

13:08.408 --> 13:11.549
- Told ya.
- However, there is a lot
of fluid buildup.

13:11.687 --> 13:14.034
I'd like to take a sample
to rule out septic arthritis.

13:14.172 --> 13:15.484
Can I take a look?

13:15.622 --> 13:17.693
You can look at anything
you want.

13:17.831 --> 13:18.867
Hey, easy, Norma.

13:19.005 --> 13:20.696
For God's sake, Norma.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.111
Jules tells me all the time.

13:22.249 --> 13:23.457
We can't talk like that anymore.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.701
Have you seen him?

13:25.839 --> 13:27.496
What do you think, Doc?

13:27.634 --> 13:29.222
These popsicle sticks
got me all the way

13:29.360 --> 13:32.121
to State Championship
back in my majorette days.

13:32.259 --> 13:34.503
Norma's worse than me.

13:36.298 --> 13:38.645
Okay, you ready to learn
how to aspirate a knee?

13:38.783 --> 13:41.061
- Absolutely.
- Uh. I'll do it.

13:41.199 --> 13:42.476
Concussions
to the back.

13:46.308 --> 13:48.310
Okay, we're gonna
tap the knee now.

13:49.967 --> 13:50.899
I'd like to tap <i>that.</i>

13:54.868 --> 13:57.250
Okay.

13:57.388 --> 13:59.252
Oh. Chief Altman!
Can I walk with you?

13:59.390 --> 14:00.909
If you can walk fast.

14:01.047 --> 14:02.980
How are you
holding up today?

14:03.118 --> 14:04.774
Today must be a crazy day
to be chief.

14:04.913 --> 14:06.846
I've got Seattle PD
and hospital security

14:06.984 --> 14:08.261
briefing me every minute,

14:08.399 --> 14:10.090
planning for every
possible threat.

14:10.228 --> 14:12.437
You know, I am really good
in a crisis,

14:12.575 --> 14:14.474
but no matter how many times
you've been in literal warfare,

14:14.612 --> 14:16.027
it never gets easier.

14:16.165 --> 14:17.995
Also,
I haven't eaten in hours,

14:18.133 --> 14:19.272
and if one more person mentions

14:19.410 --> 14:21.032
"risk assessment"
or "liability,"

14:21.170 --> 14:23.517
I might just walk out of here
and never come back.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.279
Though, I'm kinda feeling
better. Thanks for asking.

14:26.417 --> 14:29.558
Yeah, I was actually going to
ask your advice about something.

14:29.696 --> 14:32.250
So, the <i>Sound Science</i> article
came out today

14:32.388 --> 14:34.804
about the partial
- heart transplant.
- Congratulations.

14:34.943 --> 14:36.945
- Yeah.
- I'm looking forward to reading
it once things calm down.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.636
Maybe skip the part
where they quoted me

14:38.774 --> 14:41.639
saying that I assembled a team
of highly skilled <i>assistants,</i>

14:41.777 --> 14:44.607
including my husband,
Dr. Winston Ndugu.

14:44.745 --> 14:46.230
Did you say that?

14:46.368 --> 14:48.957
I also said that
he's a highly skilled surgeon

14:49.095 --> 14:50.372
and that it was
a 50/50 effort,

14:50.510 --> 14:52.098
but they didn't
print that.

14:52.236 --> 14:53.582
Well, now it looks like
you're taking all the credit

14:53.720 --> 14:55.308
- and insulting your husband.
- Exactly.

14:55.446 --> 14:57.206
Alright, how can I help
you out with this?

14:57.344 --> 15:00.347
Can the hospital ask
for a correction?

15:00.485 --> 15:01.417
Please.

15:02.729 --> 15:04.904
I-I wouldn't ask if this
wasn't urgent.

15:05.042 --> 15:06.802
Okay, I will put a call
into the PR department

15:06.940 --> 15:08.493
once I get through today,

15:08.631 --> 15:11.496
but, Pierce, you really
should talk to your husband.

15:11.634 --> 15:12.877
Owen and I didn't talk
for months,

15:13.015 --> 15:14.603
and it nearly broke us.

15:14.741 --> 15:17.088
Do not wait for the hospital
to issue a statement.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.991
Okay, let's get started.
Sorry I'm late.

15:24.785 --> 15:26.649
Excuse me.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.690
All that chaos
outside, and look at her.

15:32.828 --> 15:35.417
Not a care in the world.
Just putting ears on a potato.

15:39.248 --> 15:40.836
Really shifts your perspective,
doesn't it?

15:48.395 --> 15:50.190
How's she doing?

15:50.328 --> 15:52.227
It's Addison.

15:52.365 --> 15:55.264
She isn't listening to anyone,
including her own body,

15:55.402 --> 15:56.956
so that she can take care
of a patient.

15:57.094 --> 15:58.854
But I know she's in pain
because she's biting her lip,

15:58.992 --> 16:00.545
which is something
that she does

16:00.683 --> 16:02.306
when she's trying to
distract herself from something.

16:02.444 --> 16:05.205
Yeah, I know she means
a lot to you."A lot" doesn't describe it.

16:05.343 --> 16:07.967
I think the universe
felt badly

16:08.105 --> 16:10.797
when I got stuck with my
three biological sisters,

16:10.935 --> 16:16.285
so eventually, it gave me
Addison and Meredith and Maggie.

16:16.423 --> 16:18.080
Mm.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.050
They need me in the ICU.

16:22.188 --> 16:24.224
Go. I could stay.

16:24.362 --> 16:26.226
I'll observe
her range of motion

16:26.364 --> 16:29.229
and keep an eye out
for that lip bite.

16:29.367 --> 16:31.991
She still needs
that follow-up X-ray, MRI,

16:32.129 --> 16:34.062
and another
neurovascular exam.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.546
Amelia...

16:35.684 --> 16:36.443
I've got her.

16:56.877 --> 16:58.086
Dr. Yasuda.

16:58.224 --> 16:59.363
Yeah.

17:01.503 --> 17:03.988
Yasuda,
are you okay?

17:04.126 --> 17:05.024
I don't think I am.

17:07.578 --> 17:09.200
She's decompensating.
Her spleen's shattered.

17:09.338 --> 17:10.960
Multiple lacerations
to the liver, as well.

17:11.099 --> 17:13.722
Let's prep for
a splenectomy and give her cryo.

17:13.860 --> 17:16.932
You know she was our very first
applicant for the fellowship?

17:17.070 --> 17:18.796
I remember.

17:18.934 --> 17:20.694
In the interview, we told her
we were concerned her pregnancy

17:20.832 --> 17:22.455
could make the timing challenging

17:22.593 --> 17:23.973
because she was coming
all the way from Tennessee.

17:24.112 --> 17:25.458
Then she said, "I'm about
to become a mother.

17:25.596 --> 17:27.184
What could be more
challenging than that?"

17:27.322 --> 17:28.909
No one could've seen
this coming, Bailey.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.223
Coming here wasn't
a requirement of her program.

17:32.361 --> 17:34.467
But she came anyway,
while pregnant,

17:34.605 --> 17:37.056
because she wanted to help
other pregnant women.

17:37.194 --> 17:39.127
And today,
she became a mother.

17:39.265 --> 17:40.783
That's our patient.
That's who we're saving.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.167
She's coding.
Hold on, Tia.

17:52.036 --> 17:53.589
Hang more FFP.Bailey: Removing the spleen.

17:56.696 --> 17:58.767
Dr. Bailey, it's yours.
It's Tia's husband.

17:58.905 --> 18:00.562
Okay, we'll call him
when we can.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.219
Ugh, she's still
bleeding everywhere.

18:02.357 --> 18:04.566
Her body can't clot
or oxygenate.

18:04.704 --> 18:06.188
Liver's still oozing.

18:06.326 --> 18:07.086
I just need a little more time
to control these bleeders.

18:07.224 --> 18:08.742
- Dr. Bailey.
- Silence it!

18:08.880 --> 18:10.330
- I'm on it.
- How are we, Knox?

18:10.468 --> 18:12.263
She's severely acidotic.
Base deficit is minus 10.

18:12.401 --> 18:13.437
I'm giving TXA.

18:13.575 --> 18:14.921
There's blood
in her NG tube.

18:15.059 --> 18:16.681
Her temperature's
dropping fast. Dr. Hunt?

18:16.819 --> 18:18.511
She didn't give up downstairs.
I am not giving up in here.

18:18.649 --> 18:20.202
If we continue operating, she
won't make it out of this O.R.

18:20.340 --> 18:23.861
Look, she's acidotic,
hypothermic, and coagulopathic.

18:23.999 --> 18:26.208
Let's take her to the ICU
and give her a break.

18:27.416 --> 18:29.418
Fine. Let's pack her.

18:29.556 --> 18:30.764
Give me as much lap pads
as you have.

18:30.902 --> 18:31.765
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

18:40.498 --> 18:42.259
You're okay.

18:42.397 --> 18:44.192
I-I have a patient
at six centimeters, so I--

18:44.330 --> 18:46.090
- Yeah, you have to go.
- I have to go.

18:48.851 --> 18:49.645
Thank you for coming.

18:53.684 --> 18:54.616
Hey, Jackie.

19:08.492 --> 19:13.704
Um... the cold will help ground
you in the present...

19:13.842 --> 19:14.946
break the shock.

19:18.709 --> 19:21.021
Will you take a look
around this room

19:21.160 --> 19:23.610
and name five objects
that you see?

19:23.748 --> 19:25.509
A bedpan.

19:25.647 --> 19:26.786
That's one.

19:26.924 --> 19:28.408
Stool.

19:28.546 --> 19:29.892
Two.

19:30.030 --> 19:31.170
Lab coat.

19:31.308 --> 19:33.586
Mm-hmm, three.

19:33.724 --> 19:35.760
I am mortified.

19:35.898 --> 19:38.660
I just froze.
Surgeons can't freeze.

19:38.798 --> 19:40.593
You weren't in an O.R.

19:40.731 --> 19:42.836
No, I can't get Tia out
of my head, just lying there.

19:42.974 --> 19:45.701
And I-I just keep thinking that
it could have been any of us.

19:45.839 --> 19:48.911
It could've been me.
I'm a monster for saying it.

19:49.049 --> 19:51.293
You're not.

19:51.431 --> 19:55.435
And do not apologize for your
reaction to a traumatic event.

19:55.573 --> 19:58.369
Today was not normal.

19:58.507 --> 20:00.613
It was violent.

20:00.751 --> 20:02.511
The clinic was attacked.
<i>You</i> were attacked.

20:02.649 --> 20:04.133
You didn't sign up
for that,

20:04.272 --> 20:06.101
and that is not what this job
is supposed to be.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.935
So, look,
take whatever time you need.

20:13.073 --> 20:14.799
Whatever space. Okay.

20:14.937 --> 20:16.525
That's what
makes you human.

20:23.912 --> 20:25.879
What's 64 divided by 8?

20:26.017 --> 20:28.054
- Eight.
- I wasn't asking you.

20:28.192 --> 20:29.573
Don't you have
other patients to bother?

20:29.711 --> 20:33.093
Oh, Norma and Maxine's prelim
test results are in.

20:37.132 --> 20:38.823
We have
your initial results.

20:38.961 --> 20:40.791
Uh, Max, would you like
to come with me?

20:40.929 --> 20:42.137
Nonsense.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.311
Whatever you have to say
to one of us,

20:43.449 --> 20:45.002
you can say to both of us.

20:45.140 --> 20:46.210
Are you comfortable
with this?

20:46.348 --> 20:47.832
Oh, you know me.

20:47.970 --> 20:50.766
I haven't cared about
propriety since 1986.

20:54.356 --> 20:57.083
You have gonorrhea.

20:57.221 --> 20:59.672
Both of you,
if that wasn't... clear.

20:59.810 --> 21:01.018
Yours settled
in your knee.

21:01.156 --> 21:03.676
It's called
gonococcal arthritis.

21:03.814 --> 21:07.093
Uh, gonorrhea is contracted
by having sexual intercourse--

21:07.231 --> 21:09.129
We know
how you get it.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.649
We have to ask you to call
all of your sexual partners.

21:11.787 --> 21:13.582
Now?

21:13.720 --> 21:17.206
I-It's advisable to, um,
get anyone who's been exposed

21:17.345 --> 21:19.933
treated regardless
of their test results.

21:20.071 --> 21:23.040
You didn't tell me you
were sleeping with someone.

21:23.178 --> 21:25.111
You didn't tell me, either.

21:25.249 --> 21:28.356
I wanted to, but it's not
exactly the conversation

21:28.494 --> 21:30.081
for the Mahjong table.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.085
<i>Hi. This is Happy Hal.</i>

21:34.223 --> 21:35.639
<i>I'm sorry I missed you.</i>

21:35.777 --> 21:37.606
<i>I'm out on the town
doing my thing.</i>

21:37.744 --> 21:39.608
<i>Please leave your name
and number</i>

21:39.746 --> 21:41.886
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

21:42.024 --> 21:43.543
Well, this is awkward.

21:50.274 --> 21:51.620
I thought we might
find you here.

21:51.758 --> 21:53.242
Carina's
delivering a baby.

21:53.381 --> 21:55.072
She operated on the doctor
who got hit.

21:55.210 --> 21:56.453
She delivered
that doctor's baby,

21:56.591 --> 21:57.902
and now she's delivering
another baby

21:58.040 --> 21:59.421
and she's
a miracle worker.

21:59.559 --> 22:01.009
I don't stop to think
about it enough,

22:01.147 --> 22:03.183
but my wife
is a bringer of life.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.909
I'm sorry, I just needed
to hear her voice.

22:05.047 --> 22:07.912
No, I get it. I get it.
It's a scary day.

22:08.050 --> 22:10.156
Guess this is
what it feels like.

22:10.294 --> 22:13.193
- What do you mean?
- To be married to us.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.574
When you and I found out
that something had happened

22:14.712 --> 22:16.818
at the clinic,
we both ran here.

22:16.956 --> 22:18.682
We had to know
that they were okay.

22:18.820 --> 22:21.029
We had to-- Oh.

22:21.167 --> 22:22.582
We had to see it. Yeah.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.689
My stomach literally
went upside down.

22:25.827 --> 22:28.277
Like, I-I felt it turn, like,
I actually might need surgery.

22:28.416 --> 22:31.280
Well, we do that to them
on a daily basis.

22:31.419 --> 22:33.421
God, it feels awful.
We're awful people.

22:35.526 --> 22:37.597
But they knew what they were
getting into, though, right?

22:37.735 --> 22:39.219
I think Carina did.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.946
Bailey married you
when you were still a doctor.

22:42.084 --> 22:44.466
Okay, vitals look good.
He looks stable for now.

22:48.505 --> 22:50.196
Griffith,
you need a break?

22:50.334 --> 22:52.923
I mean, I'm kinda the one
who got hit by a car over here.

22:53.061 --> 22:55.788
Sorry. I just...

22:55.926 --> 22:57.962
I was in here
when I was born.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.137
In the NICU?
In <i>this</i> NICU.

23:00.275 --> 23:03.727
My mom was somewhere on another
floor, fighting for her life.

23:03.865 --> 23:05.384
And I'm just...

23:05.522 --> 23:07.178
amazed.

23:07.316 --> 23:09.284
Amazed by what?

23:09.422 --> 23:10.803
Someone like you
did this for me.

23:10.941 --> 23:12.908
Someone like you
saved my life.

23:13.046 --> 23:14.462
He's bradycardic.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.118
Start chest compressions
and keep 'em coming.

23:20.951 --> 23:22.228
No breath sounds.
Ambu him.

23:22.366 --> 23:23.816
Sats are dropping.
Do we need an X-ray?

23:23.954 --> 23:25.507
There's no time for that.
Give me your pen light.

23:25.645 --> 23:27.647
Wh-- Wh--Ask questions later, Griffith.

23:27.785 --> 23:29.373
Okay, and turn
that light off. Now.

23:34.896 --> 23:38.002
See how this side lights up
and this side doesn't?

23:38.140 --> 23:40.660
He's got a pneumothorax. I need
a 22-gauge needle and a syringe.

23:40.798 --> 23:41.558
Hurry, please.

23:50.705 --> 23:51.499
Go ahead.

23:52.707 --> 23:53.742
10 cc's of air.

24:01.336 --> 24:02.682
And I have breath sounds.

24:02.820 --> 24:04.926
Heart rate's coming up.
Sats are normalizing.

24:05.064 --> 24:06.859
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

24:06.997 --> 24:08.930
Can you get an oscillator
and prep for a chest tube

24:09.068 --> 24:12.243
and give him
another dose of surfactant?

24:12.381 --> 24:14.142
Okay.

24:16.662 --> 24:18.526
No, I've got this, Wilson.

24:18.664 --> 24:20.493
Y-You go check up
on your other patients.

24:20.631 --> 24:22.115
Are you sure? Because I-I know
that she just--

24:22.253 --> 24:23.254
I'm sure.

24:25.049 --> 24:26.085
Okay.

24:53.733 --> 24:54.734
<i>Hi. You've reached
Brandon Marwood.</i>

24:54.872 --> 24:55.908
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

24:58.566 --> 25:03.432
Uh, y-- Mr. Marwood, uh,
it's Dr. Bailey from Grey-Sloan.

25:03.571 --> 25:07.160
I know you're on a plane
right now, but I have an update.

25:07.298 --> 25:11.268
Tia has been transferred
to the ICU.

25:11.406 --> 25:13.442
We're gonna let her rest
for a few hours,

25:13.581 --> 25:16.273
and then
take her back to the O.R.

25:16.411 --> 25:19.483
and finish repairing
her injuries.

25:21.347 --> 25:24.764
Um... we'll be right here
waiting for you.

25:24.902 --> 25:26.697
I won't leave her side.

25:37.984 --> 25:40.953
So, <i>she's</i> your Tuesday night
- "standing canasta game"?
- Oh!

25:41.091 --> 25:42.782
And she's your "Well,
I'll just go take a nap

25:42.920 --> 25:43.956
in the community room"?

25:44.094 --> 25:45.198
Ladies, please.

25:45.336 --> 25:47.200
You said you didn't even
like blondes!

25:47.338 --> 25:48.339
She's not
a natural blonde.

25:48.477 --> 25:49.962
I am so!

25:50.100 --> 25:51.032
Okay, Max, calm down,
calm down.

25:51.170 --> 25:52.412
Norma,
you calm down, too.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.968
Hal, if you could just
sit by Dr. Kwan.

25:56.106 --> 25:57.797
Sir, your results should be
back soon,

25:57.935 --> 25:59.488
but we'd like to give you
the shot anyway

25:59.627 --> 26:01.801
because you're likely
the... source.

26:01.939 --> 26:05.494
That's impossible.
I am healthy as a horse!

26:05.633 --> 26:07.945
The most common STD symptoms
are often no symptoms at all.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.465
- Oh, my God.
- You'll need to contact
your sexual partners.

26:10.603 --> 26:11.466
All of 'em?

26:11.604 --> 26:13.641
Yes.
Hal.

26:13.779 --> 26:16.885
Oh, geez.

26:17.023 --> 26:18.577
Uh...

26:18.715 --> 26:21.925
Hazel Rothman, Judy Booth...

26:22.063 --> 26:24.583
Oh, yeah.
Martha from water aerobics.

26:24.721 --> 26:25.825
Not Martha!

26:25.963 --> 26:27.827
She's 98!

26:27.965 --> 26:29.277
You're an ageist!

26:29.415 --> 26:31.106
- And you're a liar!
- You son of a bitch!

26:31.244 --> 26:32.107
And you're a filthy liar,
and you're not even
that good in bed.

26:32.245 --> 26:34.247
This is officially
an outbreak.

26:34.385 --> 26:36.284
Contact the housing manager
and let them know

26:36.422 --> 26:39.494
that the residents are spreading
gonorrhea and need tests.

26:39.632 --> 26:41.945
- And condoms.
- But Millin lives there.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.429
Can't she just leave a note on
the social halls or something?

26:43.567 --> 26:45.776
I don't care.
Just somebody let them know.

26:45.914 --> 26:48.089
Sooner
rather than later.

26:48.227 --> 26:51.195
It's remarkable. Hmm.

26:51.333 --> 26:54.440
It's the resilience,
the will to live.

26:54.578 --> 26:57.132
Yeah.
Never ceases to amaze me.

27:02.068 --> 27:04.553
Tia?
Stable, for now.

27:04.692 --> 27:07.971
And Dr. Lincoln
is waiting for you.

27:08.109 --> 27:09.662
Yeah. Tell him
I'll be there soon.

27:09.800 --> 27:12.216
Yeah, see, he said you'd say
that, and that I should say

27:12.354 --> 27:16.220
if you want to operate again,
"soon" should be... now.

27:16.358 --> 27:18.947
And then, he said that if I
couldn't get you to come out,

27:19.085 --> 27:21.950
he'd make me pay for it.

27:22.088 --> 27:22.951
Personally.
Oh, my God.

27:23.089 --> 27:25.505
Alright.
I'm coming. Just...

27:25.644 --> 27:28.163
page me if anything changes, immediately.

27:34.687 --> 27:37.276
Uh, mind if I stay
with Connor?

27:39.140 --> 27:42.764
I-I heard Tia tell Dr. Wilson
they were gonna name him Connor.

27:44.524 --> 27:45.629
Hi, Connor.

27:58.228 --> 27:59.470
What do you need,
Yasuda?

27:59.608 --> 28:01.093
Sorry I disappeared.

28:01.231 --> 28:03.405
Did I miss anything?

28:03.543 --> 28:05.097
Right.

28:05.235 --> 28:06.926
Could I sit with her
for a minute?

28:07.064 --> 28:09.342
Let you take a break,
grab some coffee?

28:09.480 --> 28:12.000
No.
Oh, um...

28:12.138 --> 28:13.243
Okay.
Then I'm-- I'm--

28:13.381 --> 28:16.108
No, she's hypotensive
and slightly tachy.

28:16.246 --> 28:18.420
She's still bleeding
from her abdomen.

28:20.008 --> 28:21.596
Oh, look at
the wound vac.

28:21.734 --> 28:22.873
Okay, uh, call the O.R.

28:23.011 --> 28:24.806
Get the team up here.
Get over here.

28:24.944 --> 28:26.428
S-Shouldn't we be taking her
back to the O.R.?

28:26.566 --> 28:27.429
No time.

28:29.086 --> 28:30.639
Y-Yasuda.

28:30.778 --> 28:32.814
If I'm going to open this woman
up, I need your hands.

28:32.952 --> 28:35.437
- We're opening her up here?
- We need to move,
right now!

28:38.786 --> 28:41.650
You'll have to wear the sling
for about four weeks,

28:41.789 --> 28:43.445
but keep your elbow, wrist,
and hand moving.

28:43.583 --> 28:45.068
It'll help.

28:45.206 --> 28:47.139
And don't ignore
the PT exercises

28:47.277 --> 28:48.727
no matter
how exhausted you get.

28:52.489 --> 28:53.973
Honestly, it...

28:54.111 --> 28:55.837
it wouldn't be
a terrible idea

28:55.975 --> 28:58.081
to take a break from the road
for a couple of weeks.

29:02.464 --> 29:04.535
Thank you.

29:08.022 --> 29:10.162
It's me.

29:12.958 --> 29:15.098
Talk to me.

29:15.236 --> 29:17.686
You know, the irony...

29:17.825 --> 29:20.828
of all of this
is that these people

29:20.966 --> 29:23.416
are targeting me
for the abortion care

29:23.554 --> 29:24.935
that I provide

29:25.073 --> 29:29.008
when that is actually
the least common procedure

29:29.146 --> 29:31.424
I am doing in the PRT.Mm.

29:31.562 --> 29:34.358
I'm mostly providing
wellness checks,

29:34.496 --> 29:39.018
prenatal care, annual...
pelvic exams, pap smears.

29:39.156 --> 29:41.365
Since so many clinics
have closed

29:41.503 --> 29:44.852
in the last several months,
I'm the only option they have.

29:44.990 --> 29:47.199
It's exhausting.

29:52.169 --> 29:53.239
It's a disaster.

29:53.377 --> 29:54.482
Hmm.

29:56.346 --> 29:59.107
And I can't take a break.

29:59.245 --> 30:01.800
If I take a break, I mean,
who-- who's gonna do the work?

30:01.938 --> 30:03.284
When he suggested
that you take a break,

30:03.422 --> 30:05.320
I thought you were gonna
throw the tablet at him.

30:05.458 --> 30:06.528
Oh, I almost did.

30:08.254 --> 30:09.393
What happened?

30:09.531 --> 30:10.705
Wound vac
was soaked with blood.

30:10.843 --> 30:11.982
She's still bleeding out.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.812
I found it.
It's the liver.

30:13.950 --> 30:14.985
What do you want to do?

30:15.123 --> 30:16.953
- Uh, Pringle maneuver.
- Bedside?

30:17.091 --> 30:18.230
Atraumatic clamps, please.

30:18.368 --> 30:20.819
Yasuda, put your hand
where my hand is.

30:20.957 --> 30:22.303
You're gonna hold
the bleeding here

30:22.441 --> 30:25.064
while Wilson clamps
the blood flow to the liver.

30:25.202 --> 30:27.239
Then I will try
and control the bleeding.

30:27.377 --> 30:28.343
Come on, come on.
Follow my hand.

30:28.481 --> 30:30.518
Okay.
Yeah. Here, I'll help.

30:30.656 --> 30:32.002
- Alright, alright.
- Like that?

30:32.140 --> 30:33.245
Exactly like that.

30:33.383 --> 30:34.660
- Okay, go, Wilson.
- Okay.

30:34.798 --> 30:36.731
Hepatoduodenal ligament
is clamped.

30:36.869 --> 30:38.629
Okay, good.
O-chromic liver suture.

30:38.767 --> 30:40.631
Great. Okay, alright.

30:40.769 --> 30:42.012
Alright, I'm going deep.

30:43.772 --> 30:44.635
I see it.

30:47.984 --> 30:49.192
Okay, pressure's climbing.

30:51.125 --> 30:52.402
Okay, scissors.

30:57.579 --> 30:59.581
Okay, let's pack her
- and get a new wound vac.
- Okay.

30:59.719 --> 31:01.687
Not yet, Tia.

31:01.825 --> 31:03.206
Too many people need you.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.698
No sexual activity
for a week.

31:12.836 --> 31:15.218
We want to give the antibiotics
time to do their job.

31:15.356 --> 31:17.530
You already told me, dear.

31:17.668 --> 31:21.741
And I heard it
when you told Norma and Hal.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.641
Just making sure.
Can't have a sick roomie.

31:24.779 --> 31:26.954
Who else is gonna make me
the world's best French toast

31:27.092 --> 31:28.541
when I work
the night shift?

31:28.679 --> 31:31.234
It's all about
a drop of vanilla.

31:31.372 --> 31:33.684
And I'm sorry that Hal
turned out to be such a jerk.

31:33.822 --> 31:35.894
Me too.
Guys can be pigs.

31:36.032 --> 31:37.309
Gay ones, too.

31:39.207 --> 31:40.450
Women can be...

31:42.279 --> 31:45.489
At first, they tell us
not to have sex at all

31:45.627 --> 31:48.320
and that we're sluts
if we enjoy it.

31:48.458 --> 31:51.150
And then they tell us
if we get pregnant,

31:51.288 --> 31:53.221
we must carry the baby
no matter what.

31:53.359 --> 31:57.329
And once we're mothers,
whether by force or by choice,

31:57.467 --> 31:59.503
they judge us for that, too.

31:59.641 --> 32:03.231
Because there's certainly
no way to be a perfect mother.

32:03.369 --> 32:06.614
So, as women,
we get judged and attacked

32:06.752 --> 32:09.444
for every single decision
we ever make.

32:09.582 --> 32:11.999
You want to know the upside
of this misogyny,

32:12.137 --> 32:13.966
this patriarchy?

32:14.104 --> 32:17.694
Women become invisible
around the age of 60,

32:17.832 --> 32:20.697
and then you can do
whatever the hell you like,

32:20.835 --> 32:25.944
including having a lot of great
sex, because no one cares.

32:26.082 --> 32:30.810
And now, I have an antibiotic
and no regrets.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.573
Except, perhaps, for waiting
so long to live my best life.

32:35.884 --> 32:37.196
See you at home, dear.

32:51.728 --> 32:54.041
Winston, I...

32:56.181 --> 32:57.216
They cherry-picked
my quotes,

32:57.354 --> 33:00.909
took everything
out of context.

33:01.048 --> 33:03.705
But I'm making them change it,
and Teddy will help.

33:03.843 --> 33:05.466
But you said it, so...

33:05.604 --> 33:08.400
I also said that you were one
of the most brilliant surgeons

33:08.538 --> 33:11.161
I have ever worked with,
and that we were equal partners.

33:11.299 --> 33:13.508
We came up with
that procedure together.

33:13.646 --> 33:15.752
I-I didn't
even get a mention.

33:15.890 --> 33:17.236
Just one of
the "assistants."

33:17.374 --> 33:19.169
Journalists always want
to characterize me

33:19.307 --> 33:21.137
as some kind of wunderkind
in a league of my own.

33:21.275 --> 33:23.139
And it's just clickbait.
That's it.

33:23.277 --> 33:24.761
Okay, so it's
the journalist's fault.

33:24.899 --> 33:26.901
Winston, I--Take some responsibility.

33:27.039 --> 33:28.592
For once!

33:31.457 --> 33:34.012
I can't control what other
people write about me.

33:35.392 --> 33:36.773
Alright.

33:36.911 --> 33:39.569
When did we stop giving each
other the benefit of the doubt?

33:43.573 --> 33:46.369
I think it's when you said
you don't respect me.

33:46.507 --> 33:49.372
And this article
<i>really</i> drives that home.

33:56.482 --> 33:59.106
I want to fix this.

33:59.244 --> 34:01.453
Tell me what to do
to fix this.

34:01.591 --> 34:04.456
- I want to fix us.
- Maggie, there's no fix.

34:04.594 --> 34:07.459
T-There's just--
There's feelings.

34:07.597 --> 34:10.117
Like, my God,
say you're sorry.

34:10.255 --> 34:13.051
Say you
got some things wrong.

34:13.189 --> 34:14.086
Say you didn't mean
to hurt me.

34:14.224 --> 34:15.950
Say you understand
how I feel.

34:16.088 --> 34:18.953
Say you love me
and mean it.

34:19.091 --> 34:21.059
Say you respect me
and mean it.

34:22.439 --> 34:24.648
I respect you, Winston.

34:26.547 --> 34:28.031
I don't believe you.

34:36.626 --> 34:38.973
Woman over P.A.:
<i>Dr. Sellers, 4619.</i>

34:39.111 --> 34:40.319
<i>Dr. Mari Sellers, 4619</i>

34:40.457 --> 34:42.321
Hey.

34:42.459 --> 34:44.841
They caught the driver.

34:44.979 --> 34:46.601
They lifted
the hospital lockdown,

34:46.739 --> 34:49.017
and if you want to keep
the clinic closed

34:49.156 --> 34:52.090
for a couple days,
everyone would understand.

34:52.228 --> 34:54.437
It'll be open
tomorrow morning.

34:54.575 --> 34:56.059
Dr. Bailey.

34:56.197 --> 34:58.337
This is Brandon Marwood,
Tia's husband.

35:01.478 --> 35:03.894
Sh-- Is she, uh...

35:04.032 --> 35:05.620
Is she gonna live?

35:05.758 --> 35:07.967
Well, she's stable,
for now.

35:08.106 --> 35:11.523
We are giving her fluid and
putting her on sedation breaks

35:11.661 --> 35:13.628
to monitor
her brain function.

35:13.766 --> 35:16.528
After all that she's been
through, there's no guarantees,

35:16.666 --> 35:19.324
but we are hopeful
that she will wake up.

35:19.462 --> 35:21.636
Okay.
If Tia has shown us
anything today,

35:21.774 --> 35:23.880
it's she's strong
and determined.

35:24.018 --> 35:26.089
Yeah.
She always has been.

35:26.227 --> 35:28.781
Wanna go in
