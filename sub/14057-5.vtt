00:01.000 --> 00:01.756
Previously on The O.C:

00:01.757 --> 00:05.484
- I'm officially giving up men.
- You cannot live without a man, not even for a week.

00:05.485 --> 00:09.324
I will not so much as bat an eyelash at a man,
and you will stay out of trouble.

00:09.325 --> 00:12.263
Solar panels on all our
dormitories or we revolt!

00:12.264 --> 00:16.300
I just want to give you room to keep doing what
you're doing, 'cause I think it's pretty amazing.

00:16.302 --> 00:19.302
So if you don't hear from me for a while,
it's not because I don't love you

00:19.303 --> 00:20.391
it's because I do.

00:20.392 --> 00:23.180
The only way I can get a divorce
is if one of us was unfaithful,

00:23.181 --> 00:24.973
and I didn't think you'd sign
if you knew the truth.

00:24.975 --> 00:28.090
Getting mixed up in other people's lives
and helping them out of jams,

00:28.093 --> 00:30.066
seems to be what you do.

00:40.809 --> 00:42.360
Bollywood, huh?

00:42.436 --> 00:45.786
I didn't know you're such a world cinema buff,
especially at 2:30 in the morning.

00:45.789 --> 00:47.333
- What are you doing up?
- I had a dream

00:47.336 --> 00:50.660
Summer was marrying Ralph Nader and
I was playing the marimba at the wedding.

00:50.668 --> 00:52.591
Good gig. Why don't you call her?

00:52.598 --> 00:55.822
I'm giving her space, remember?
I promised myself I'd wait at least a week

00:56.448 --> 00:58.293
before calling.
What are they dancing about?

00:58.298 --> 01:00.353
This guy just saw his girlfriend's ankle.

01:00.718 --> 01:03.780
- You think it's about time to talk to someone?
- Nobody ever died of insomnia.

01:03.788 --> 01:08.102
Fine. You know what? I'm sort of in the mood for a
chaste Hindu love story with lots of needless dancing.

01:08.107 --> 01:09.930
Seth, go to bed.

01:09.937 --> 01:12.800
No can do.
If you're awake, I'm awake.

01:59.428 --> 02:01.383
Come on. Love is...

02:02.457 --> 02:04.982
- Nice.
- Thank you.

02:05.206 --> 02:08.252
You know, you'd be a lot sharper
if you didn't sleep on the couch.

02:08.257 --> 02:11.413
You know, maybe you should invest in
some less-comfortable furniture.

02:11.415 --> 02:13.460
Why don't you chew on that for a while?

02:13.465 --> 02:15.752
- Morning, all.
- Hey, how'd it go?

02:15.756 --> 02:17.560
Oh. I'll get it.

02:17.816 --> 02:19.981
Five feet, glassy,

02:19.988 --> 02:24.450
and I got that skinflint Sweeton to pledge
$30,000 to the PD's Youth Outreach Program.

02:24.456 --> 02:28.822
Oh, they are so lucky that you
are organizing that event.

02:28.875 --> 02:30.470
You are amazing.

02:31.795 --> 02:33.391
Uh-huh.

02:33.917 --> 02:36.733
- What do you need?
- I just need a slogan for New Match.

02:37.055 --> 02:42.382
So far, your son has come up with
"Love is Nice" and "Love Schmov."

02:43.247 --> 02:46.590
"Love is a smoke made with the fumes of sighs

02:46.596 --> 02:49.720
being purged a fire sparkling
in lovers' eyes."

02:49.727 --> 02:52.443
- Taylor, that's beautiful.
- Shakespeare.

02:52.447 --> 02:54.342
Old Bill's always good for a line.

02:54.358 --> 02:55.943
Julie left this in my car.

02:55.945 --> 02:58.890
So, um, I was in the neighborhood,
I thought I'd drop it by in case you needed it.

02:58.897 --> 03:01.263
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm going to go give Ryan some coffee.

03:01.266 --> 03:02.851
- Um, I can do that.
- Thank you.

03:17.426 --> 03:18.883
Hello?

03:20.775 --> 03:22.322
Easy, girl.

03:24.937 --> 03:27.012
Taylor, what are you doing here?

03:27.018 --> 03:30.632
Um, I'm just, uh, bringing
Kirsten some papers.

03:30.636 --> 03:32.442
- This is for you.
- Oh, thanks, but actually,

03:32.448 --> 03:34.462
I'm kind of not drinking coffee right now.

03:35.886 --> 03:39.832
Well, Ryan, I just wanted to thank you again
for helping me with my husband,

03:39.835 --> 03:42.241
- and I am...
- You don't have to pay me back.

03:42.246 --> 03:43.753
Are you kidding?

03:43.755 --> 03:46.102
If it wasn't for you, I would be in France right now,

03:46.125 --> 03:48.460
trapped in a loveless marriage.

03:48.778 --> 03:50.723
You saved my life,

03:50.736 --> 03:53.200
and I am at your command.

03:53.256 --> 03:56.270
Anything you want...
anything.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.563
You could hand me that shirt.

04:05.317 --> 04:07.471
You joker.

04:08.266 --> 04:09.400
Here.

04:09.407 --> 04:11.071
Um, I'm serious.

04:11.075 --> 04:12.991
You're not getting out of this so easily.

04:12.996 --> 04:16.091
You know, in some cultures, they say that if you save
someone's life,

04:16.737 --> 04:19.503
- you're bound to them forever.
- Oh.

04:23.117 --> 04:24.563
Bye.

04:25.707 --> 04:27.370
Here she comes.

04:30.288 --> 04:32.480
You know, it's odd, but I never

04:32.495 --> 04:35.193
appreciated how funny Ryan is.

04:37.488 --> 04:39.823
Life-- such a journey.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.051
Well, have a nice day.

04:45.737 --> 04:47.743
She said Ryan was funny.

05:30.017 --> 05:31.733
Oh, my God.

05:31.757 --> 05:34.533
- Wake up! Wake up!
- Oh, what are you doing?

05:34.537 --> 05:37.230
It's almost 8:00. You have to get out of here
before my daughter wakes up.

05:38.335 --> 05:39.942
Schnell!

05:41.646 --> 05:43.512
Oh, my God.

05:48.485 --> 05:51.463
- Are you my new daddy?
- Oh, uh, good morning.

05:51.466 --> 05:53.550
I'm, I'm your mom's personal trainer.

05:53.555 --> 05:55.350
We were just doing an early
morning workout.

05:55.358 --> 05:57.920
Oh, really?
How much do you charge for that?

05:58.425 --> 06:00.232
- Well...
- Save it, okay?

06:00.238 --> 06:02.990
If my mom wants to club five nights a week,
sleep till noon,

06:02.996 --> 06:06.351
and hook up with some 25-year-old Bavarian beefcake,

06:06.357 --> 06:08.383
it just means she's got less time for me.

06:09.326 --> 06:11.570
- The door is that way, Hans.
- Okay.

06:21.615 --> 06:27.233
Kaitlin... You are having breakfast alone?

06:27.668 --> 06:30.291
- Yeah, why? Who else would be here?
- No one.

06:30.718 --> 06:33.680
Uh, although my new personal
trainer was going to come over.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.661
You know, we single women have to stay in shape.

06:37.077 --> 06:39.252
Well, I'm sure he'll give you
a very good workout.

06:48.556 --> 06:49.873
Oh, no.

06:50.627 --> 06:51.810
Seth!

06:52.448 --> 06:54.362
- Good, you're here.
- Actually, I was just, I was...

06:54.367 --> 06:58.882
You might want to sit down.
I have huge news and a favor to ask you.

06:58.887 --> 07:02.001
You like Ryan and you want my help
convincing him to date you?

07:02.015 --> 07:03.181
Wow.

07:03.187 --> 07:05.141
You said he was funny;
that's kind of a giveaway.

07:05.148 --> 07:07.442
I know, it's crazy. I mean,
I've always thought

07:07.446 --> 07:10.410
"Cute guy, might be good for a night
of rough-and-tumble fun,

07:10.427 --> 07:12.260
but it's not like we have anything in common."

07:12.265 --> 07:13.802
So ignore it. It's probably just gas.

07:13.806 --> 07:16.053
But then when he helped me with
my husband and he kissed me,

07:16.055 --> 07:18.902
it was like Dorothy landing in Oz.

07:18.908 --> 07:21.140
-  Everything just popped into Technicolor.
- Ah

07:23.148 --> 07:24.900
You think I don't know what that means?

07:25.017 --> 07:26.820
I said, "Ah."

07:26.838 --> 07:30.761
Meaning, "Ah, that Taylor,
she is so pathetic."

07:30.766 --> 07:34.210
Someone's the least bit nice to her
and she becomes totally obsessed with them.

07:34.218 --> 07:38.213
First me, and then her French husband
when he lent her a subway ticket, now Ryan.

07:38.217 --> 07:41.011
- Well, you know, isn't it kind of true?
- So what?

07:41.615 --> 07:44.630
Yes, I have a psychological predilection

07:44.638 --> 07:47.060
to become romantically attached
to men who are nice to me

07:47.067 --> 07:49.421
due to the fact that I was raised by
a she-wolf of a mother

07:49.428 --> 07:51.143
who practiced emotional terrorism.

07:51.148 --> 07:54.660
Does that mean that if by some miracle,
love does come into my life, I should deny it?

07:54.668 --> 07:57.181
What kind of person would that make me?
What kind of life...

07:57.186 --> 08:00.421
- Taylor, what do you want me to do?
- Find out if he's ready to start dating.

08:00.425 --> 08:01.390
Okay.

08:10.655 --> 08:12.812
- Hello?
- Hey, you're doing a great job.

08:13.436 --> 08:15.390
- Thanks.
- Did you finish the movie last night?

08:15.398 --> 08:16.742
- Uh, which one?
- Uh-huh.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.491
- Are you ready to date again?
- What?

08:18.606 --> 08:21.610
- Simple question.
- I have no idea. Why?

08:21.618 --> 08:22.881
Okay, cool.

08:25.026 --> 08:27.483
He's not sure. Listen,

08:27.767 --> 08:29.793
you don't want to get involved
with him right now, okay?

08:29.797 --> 08:32.243
He slept like four hours in the last week.

08:32.248 --> 08:34.323
- He's a mess.
- Really?

08:34.326 --> 08:35.760
Interesting.

08:48.918 --> 08:51.740
Excuse  me? Can you not do that now?

08:52.217 --> 08:54.190
- Excuse me.
- Hey, we're supposed to clean, buddy.

08:54.197 --> 08:55.890
Yeah, and I am in the middle of something.

08:55.906 --> 08:57.952
- What's this one's name?
- Don't touch that.

08:57.958 --> 09:00.111
They're part of an experiment.

09:01.635 --> 09:02.922
You're a janitor?

09:02.925 --> 09:04.062
- Uh
- huh.

09:04.065 --> 09:06.170
Uh, you know, we can just go.
Betty, we'll come back later.

09:06.173 --> 09:08.496
Yes, Lou, we should go.

09:17.779 --> 09:19.890
So you're going to hold the ball gently, okay, like, um,

09:20.126 --> 09:22.446
like you're holding ice cream.
I stopped eating ice cream.

09:22.449 --> 09:24.733
- So what do you eat?
- Nonfat, non-dairy yogurt.

09:25.287 --> 09:27.303
Fine, hold the ball like nonfat yogurt.

09:27.308 --> 09:29.363
Okay. But if I serve this one in,

09:29.377 --> 09:31.212
you have to go out with me.

09:31.227 --> 09:33.892
Kaitlin, how many times I got to say this?

09:33.898 --> 09:36.042
- You're 15.
- So a kiss is still out of the question?

09:36.398 --> 09:38.230
Just serve the ball.

09:43.445 --> 09:46.763
- There it is, it's over the net.
- Well, I was wondering if maybe

09:46.766 --> 09:49.080
you wanted to squeeze me in for a training session tonight.

09:56.406 --> 09:58.270
Easy girl.

09:58.808 --> 10:00.493
Hold on a second.

10:00.618 --> 10:02.772
Eye on the ball. Come on.

10:02.845 --> 10:04.420
Kaitlin,

10:04.435 --> 10:06.340
you didn't tell me you had a new instructor.

10:06.348 --> 10:08.490
Hi, I'm Julie Cooper, Kaitlin's mother.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.022
How you doing? Spencer.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.253
Uh, your daughter, she's got a lot of potential.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.940
- So you play?
- Oh, no, I used to, but...

10:22.138 --> 10:24.330
I was actually thinking about getting back into it.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.851
Wow.

10:26.857 --> 10:29.933
- Hey. You're early.
- Well, I wanted to see the new place up and running...

10:29.938 --> 10:31.522
- and give you this.
- Oh...

10:32.055 --> 10:35.740
- So Julie already took off, huh?
- She had to pick up Kaitlin at tennis.

10:36.445 --> 10:39.982
Oh, it's a Wonder Woman paperweight.

10:39.985 --> 10:42.150
Seth gave me his employee discount.

10:42.157 --> 10:44.472
Well, it may end up being a souvenir.

10:46.537 --> 10:48.072
What are you talking about?

10:48.085 --> 10:51.842
Remember that woman that I told you about
in Laguna that has a high-end dating service?

10:51.845 --> 10:53.822
Yeah, she's going to retire, sell you her client list.

10:53.826 --> 10:56.603
Well, she got another offer,
four times ours,

10:56.608 --> 10:59.073
and right now we don't have enough
money to counter,

10:59.075 --> 11:01.301
which means that all of this
could be short-lived.

11:01.306 --> 11:02.682
What about taking on a backer?

11:02.686 --> 11:04.621
I could you put in touch with
the donors I've been talking to.

11:04.625 --> 11:06.521
I'm playing golf tomrow with Gordon Bullet.

11:06.527 --> 11:08.372
- The oil tycoon?
- Yeah.

11:08.845 --> 11:12.052
- Didn't he go to jail for tax evasion?
- Yeah, but he's out now.

11:12.395 --> 11:14.182
I had dinner with him last month.

11:14.187 --> 11:16.702
He's really not a bad guy for being a total pig.

11:16.705 --> 11:18.201
I don't know.

11:18.315 --> 11:20.373
We just wanted to do this ourselves.

11:20.705 --> 11:23.653
And besides, having a silent partner,
they always have an opinion.

11:23.658 --> 11:25.862
Well, it's my impression he's
got a lot of fish to fry.

11:25.866 --> 11:28.470
So I doubt he'd be involved in your
day-to-day, but I could ask him.

11:29.245 --> 11:31.100
Okay.

11:31.378 --> 11:32.901
Thanks.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.343
Clear.

11:50.216 --> 11:52.492
Did you find out what they were doing with them?

11:52.975 --> 11:54.241
Does it matter?

11:54.246 --> 11:58.170
If it wasn't evil, they wouldn't have
to keep them locked in cages like animals.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.891
What's the plan again?

11:59.895 --> 12:04.272
The plan is to set them loose and
then lead them to the forest.

12:04.278 --> 12:06.293
The forest, across the river.

12:06.298 --> 12:07.713
Lead them, how?

12:07.717 --> 12:09.410
- I brought my flute.
- Your flute?

12:09.418 --> 12:10.712
Like the Pied Piper?

12:10.728 --> 12:13.021
Uh, no, scientific study shows

12:13.035 --> 12:15.851
that music actually triggers a reaction

12:15.867 --> 12:18.091
inside the pleasure center of the rabbit's brain.

12:18.095 --> 12:19.221
Check this out.

12:19.396 --> 12:21.400
Ah...

12:21.856 --> 12:23.371
Feel his heartbeat. It's calmer.

12:23.498 --> 12:27.092
It's just to keep them calm. But trust me, as soon
as they feel the free air on their faces,

12:27.095 --> 12:28.853
they're going to be leading us.

12:28.856 --> 12:29.922
Hi.

12:30.406 --> 12:31.960
You're a fat bunny.

12:32.256 --> 12:34.221
You're name is Pancakes.
Did you know that?

12:34.837 --> 12:37.112
Huh? Pancakes.

12:37.425 --> 12:39.033
Hey, come here.

12:39.035 --> 12:42.733
Okay, when I open this door we've got about
60 seconds till the storm troopers arrive.

12:42.986 --> 12:44.881
You ready to do this?

12:44.888 --> 12:46.260
Yeah.

12:47.836 --> 12:50.981
Welcome to liberty, my friends.

12:57.725 --> 12:59.470
Come on, Pancakes.

13:17.268 --> 13:18.551
- Taylor?
- Ryan,

13:18.556 --> 13:21.640
you can't sleep, can you?
You poor thing.

13:22.358 --> 13:24.731
- It's 3:00 in the morning.
- Seth told me everything.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.603
But lucky for you, junior year,

13:26.607 --> 13:29.653
I won the state science fair
for my study in sleep disorders.

13:29.655 --> 13:31.153
I can help you.

13:31.155 --> 13:33.692
Oh, well, that's really nice, but actually,
you know, I'm fine.

13:33.707 --> 13:35.642
It's the middle of the night,
and you're wide awake.

13:35.645 --> 13:37.942
- So are you.
- Well, I never sleep more than four hours a night.

13:37.958 --> 13:41.312
It's unproductive.
Ryan, don't you see, this is how I'll pay you back.

13:42.587 --> 13:45.541
Yeah. You know what? Actually, I'm kind of tired.

13:45.547 --> 13:46.922
Stop lying.

13:46.925 --> 13:49.170
I want you to meet me tomorrow
morning at 8:00, at the diner.

13:49.175 --> 13:50.910
And  I won't take no
for an answer.

13:51.676 --> 13:53.032
Fine.

13:53.188 --> 13:54.480
Ryan?

13:54.955 --> 13:56.041
Yeah?

13:56.045 --> 13:57.172
Good night.

13:57.176 --> 13:58.583
Good night, Taylor.

14:32.525 --> 14:34.770
Okay, just relax.
Be normal.

14:36.646 --> 14:38.130
You can do this.

14:41.617 --> 14:43.660
- Good morning, Ryan.
- Hi.

14:43.668 --> 14:45.593
Oh, you poor thing.
You look exhausted.

14:45.608 --> 14:46.911
Yeah, well, look, Taylor,

14:46.917 --> 14:48.761
I don't know what Seth told you,
but I'm fine, really.

14:48.775 --> 14:50.850
- I've got work, so...
- Did you sleep at all last night?

14:51.516 --> 14:53.921
- No, but, uh...
- And how about the night before?

14:54.636 --> 14:58.381
Ryan, insomnia can go on for months.

14:58.528 --> 15:00.422
What's the harm in letting me try and help you?

15:02.387 --> 15:06.203
- Fire away.
- Okay. So, um, first off...

15:08.258 --> 15:10.330
How much of this is related to Marissa?

15:10.475 --> 15:13.613
I'm really sorry to ask,
but if that's what's going on,

15:14.065 --> 15:17.002
I think we need to know.
Well, I need to know.

15:17.195 --> 15:18.663
It's not about her.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.150
It started after Thanksgiving.

15:23.775 --> 15:25.662
Right after Volchok turned himself in?

15:25.827 --> 15:27.662
- Yeah, I guess, why?
- Ryan

15:28.827 --> 15:30.783
- I'm just spit-balling here...
- Yeah, yeah.

15:30.787 --> 15:32.920
But, um, this is the guy you
wanted revenge on, right?

15:33.478 --> 15:35.950
So you probably went to bed every night thinking,

15:35.956 --> 15:37.473
"I'll get him tomorrow."

15:37.627 --> 15:39.590
But now that purpose is gone so

15:39.596 --> 15:41.720
what's the point, in going to bed

15:42.178 --> 15:43.993
if there's no p
in waking up?

15:45.648 --> 15:47.612
- I hadn't thought about that.
- Oh, my God.

15:47.937 --> 15:49.762
I am such an awesome sleep therapist.

15:50.096 --> 15:51.832
And this is only our first session.

15:53.038 --> 15:54.662
Yeah, listen, I better go.

15:56.147 --> 15:57.350
Yes.

15:58.707 --> 16:01.683
But, uh, thanks.
This was, uh...

16:02.626 --> 16:03.672
Good.

16:04.508 --> 16:06.101
Well, my pleasure.

16:20.678 --> 16:22.101
Bye.

16:28.735 --> 16:30.040
You ready?

16:34.736 --> 16:37.210
- Nice shot, Julie.
- Thank you, Spencer.

16:37.327 --> 16:39.562
You know, this is supposed
to be my tennis lesson.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.913
Don't you think it's fun
to do mother-daughter stuff?

16:42.878 --> 16:44.313
Please.

16:47.655 --> 16:50.110
Come on, keep your eye on the ball, Kaitlin.
Let's go.

17:07.747 --> 17:09.130
Do you mind?

17:09.137 --> 17:11.000
- It's the third time.
- Sorry.

17:19.058 --> 17:20.510
Are you all right?

17:20.517 --> 17:22.321
- This will help with the serve.
- Right.

17:22.327 --> 17:24.031
I think I really strained it.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.691
- I'm strong.
- You are strong.

17:26.695 --> 17:28.082
I'm pretty impressed.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.201
Ooh, perfect.

17:41.075 --> 17:42.701
Where's my racket?

17:42.708 --> 17:44.501
Oh, that's weird.

17:44.777 --> 17:46.410
You  know, I'm ready when you are.

17:46.418 --> 17:48.613
Well, I get that she did a fine job

17:48.618 --> 17:50.373
in that whole Middle East thing but,

17:50.376 --> 17:53.220
I'm sorry Madeline Albright-- not hot.

17:53.307 --> 17:55.953
- Well, Gordon...
- I told you to call me Bullet.

17:55.957 --> 17:58.202
Well, Bullet, call me crazy,

17:58.205 --> 18:00.822
but maybe Madeline Albright
doesn't need to be hot.

18:00.828 --> 18:02.922
Oh, well, that's an interesting
point of view, Sandy.

18:02.926 --> 18:05.863
Hey, your donation to the PD's Outreach Program
was really generous, thank you.

18:05.865 --> 18:09.001
Oh, well, you caught me at the right time.
I was in bed with those Arab fellas.

18:09.606 --> 18:10.970
That's a metaphor.

18:10.978 --> 18:13.911
Them boys cooked the books on me,
so I sold out.

18:13.918 --> 18:16.092
Left them high and dry.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.513
They never should have messed
with old Bullet. Bang.

18:18.516 --> 18:19.973
All righty.

18:23.197 --> 18:25.003
Look at that.

18:25.007 --> 18:27.281
Shii-ite Muslim.

18:28.907 --> 18:32.833
You see, the point is, I'm cash-rich right now,
and I don't know what to do with all the stuff.

18:32.835 --> 18:34.342
Really?

18:34.347 --> 18:35.952
- Cigar?
- No, thanks.

18:35.967 --> 18:38.532
They're Cuban.
Commie bastards do one thing right.

18:38.537 --> 18:41.002
You know, my wife just started a business,
and she and her partner

18:41.008 --> 18:43.021
are thinking about taking on investors.
In fact, you could talk

18:43.026 --> 18:45.860
to them about it tomorrow at the benefit--
you know, get the details.

18:45.876 --> 18:47.972
Well, I don't think I'm
going tomorrow, Sandy.

18:48.216 --> 18:50.702
You see, my date went
back to her husband.

18:50.706 --> 18:52.852
I'm going to do you a favor.
You should talk to my wife,

18:52.857 --> 18:55.833
because that's the business she's in,
and her partner is newly single.

18:56.256 --> 18:57.890
She hot?

18:59.708 --> 19:02.892
And I was into recycling
way before it was cool.

19:02.898 --> 19:06.171
Al Gore got half that stuff from a paper
I wrote in sixth grade.

19:06.348 --> 19:08.341
I just don't, you know, make a stink,

19:08.346 --> 19:11.030
- because he's doing good work.
- Well, when are you allowed to call Summer again?

19:11.035 --> 19:13.283
10:03 tomorrow. Am I driving you crazy?

19:13.288 --> 19:14.162
No, no.

19:14.788 --> 19:17.852
Hi Seth. Ryan, I need your keys.
I have to get your room ready.

19:17.858 --> 19:20.190
- What?
- Oh, I'm Ryan's sleep therapist.

19:20.346 --> 19:21.743
Right.

19:22.417 --> 19:24.222
Uh, that's your tacos.

19:30.366 --> 19:31.941
- Because you can't.
- Why not?

19:31.947 --> 19:33.850
I did not tell you about Ryan's sleep problems,

19:33.856 --> 19:35.950
so you could use it for some weirdo seduction.

19:35.955 --> 19:38.120
- I'm not...
- Are you a sleep therapist? Are you certified?

19:38.128 --> 19:42.482
Sleep ther... Do you have a little certificate
from the American Institute of... uh, the sleep place?

19:42.486 --> 19:44.333
And what if I can help him?
He wins, I win.

19:44.335 --> 19:46.143
- They call it win-win for a reason.
- It doesn't matter.

19:46.156 --> 19:48.150
- You can't.
- Just say what you're really thinking, Seth.

19:49.816 --> 19:51.331
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
- Great.

19:51.336 --> 19:53.652
Could you go get me some
pico de gallo?

19:54.315 --> 19:55.903
Yeah. Sure.

19:58.187 --> 20:00.741
It's true-- you don't think
"Oh, Taylor, she's so funny,

20:00.747 --> 20:02.472
what a kook, but her and Ryan, please."

20:02.477 --> 20:04.521
- You need help, do you know that?
- "I mean, she's no Marissa."

20:07.166 --> 20:08.572
Exactly.

20:09.195 --> 20:10.402
Here you go.

20:10.527 --> 20:12.421
Thanks, I've got to get
back to the shop.

20:12.426 --> 20:13.930
Yeah, I better go, too.

20:16.745 --> 20:18.033
Hey, Amber. Did Seth...?

20:18.037 --> 20:19.723
Your boyfriend didn't call.

20:20.645 --> 20:22.740
I thought he was
giving you space.

20:22.968 --> 20:25.131
Uh... he is. It doesn't mean
that I can't call him.

20:25.138 --> 20:26.592
Oldest trick in the book.

20:26.596 --> 20:29.630
I'm giving you space so you can call
first and look like the needy one.

20:30.025 --> 20:31.960
- Seth isn't doing that.
- Of course not.

20:32.777 --> 20:35.213
Oh, but the dean's office called.
They want to see you tomorrow.

20:35.316 --> 20:37.523
- What? Did they say what for?
- No.

20:38.596 --> 20:42.232
Hey, did you hear that someone set free
the bunnies in one of the science labs?

20:43.047 --> 20:44.422
Huh, really?

20:44.986 --> 20:46.980
Well, maybe someone
thought it was inhumane.

20:46.987 --> 20:49.293
Maybe someone didn't know
they were only being studied

20:49.295 --> 20:52.673
for their socialization patterns and
lived a pretty cushy life.

20:53.207 --> 20:54.983
By the way, there's a rabbit
under your bed.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.220
- Che.
- I got the call, too.

21:01.226 --> 21:03.452
That scientist picked us
out of a face book.

21:03.458 --> 21:06.220
Apparently the chiseled features of freedom,
not that hard to recognize.

21:06.225 --> 21:08.523
- What are you going to do?
- Breathe, caterpillar.

21:08.525 --> 21:10.710
It's  all going to be okay. I went
through the same exact

21:10.715 --> 21:12.963
thing when they tried to frame me for
flooding the trustee dinner.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.903
But you did flood
the trustees' dinner.

21:14.906 --> 21:16.943
Yeah, but they didn't know that.
Flax and Oats?

21:16.946 --> 21:18.490
I don't think I can lie.

21:18.507 --> 21:20.121
Of course you can't.

21:20.776 --> 21:23.322
No more than the wind could lie,
or a tree.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.212
Oh...

21:27.368 --> 21:29.242
I have to go write a song.

21:29.245 --> 21:32.411
I just came by to tell you that
I am with you until the end.

21:34.485 --> 21:36.272
But, Che, what if they kick us out?

21:37.757 --> 21:40.811
Then in the words
of the great Chief Aupumut--

21:40.818 --> 21:42.642
I will sing my death song

21:43.115 --> 21:46.073
and die like a warrior going home.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.400
Pancakes.

22:03.866 --> 22:05.570
I thought we were going
to the beach.

22:05.575 --> 22:08.523
In a minute. I just want him
to see me in my bikini first.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.602
You mean you want him to molest you.

22:10.605 --> 22:13.070
All right, shut up.
I have real feelings for this guy...

22:15.108 --> 22:16.792
Oh, my God.

22:17.847 --> 22:19.802
Wow, looks like your mom has some
feelings, too--

22:19.807 --> 22:21.463
for that guy's butt.

22:21.666 --> 22:24.901
Dude, why are you talking
about that guy's butt?

22:24.955 --> 22:26.833
- Shut up.
- You're so gay sometimes.

22:47.118 --> 22:48.541
Oh, my God.

22:48.946 --> 22:51.120
- Welcome home, Ryan.
- Taylor.

22:54.965 --> 22:57.223
Taylor, Taylor.
This, um...

22:57.227 --> 22:59.092
- Are you wearing pajamas?
- Oh, yes.

22:59.096 --> 23:01.662
Many people sleep better with
a warm body beside them.

23:02.527 --> 23:04.431
Don't worry.
It's completely non-sexual.

23:04.436 --> 23:07.021
Yeah.
I've got to ask, though.

23:08.586 --> 23:10.151
Is this...

23:11.148 --> 23:13.191
I mean, you don't,
you don't

23:15.216 --> 23:17.490
Yeah, I like you.
We're friends.

23:17.498 --> 23:19.023
No, I mean, the, um...

23:24.217 --> 23:27.492
My goodness, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

23:28.087 --> 23:30.902
I just, you know, I want
to pay you back and, um...

23:30.905 --> 23:33.152
I happen to be really interested
in sleep disorders.

23:38.085 --> 23:41.153
- Okay.
- Great. Shall we start with a massage?

23:53.045 --> 23:54.121
Whoa!

23:54.216 --> 23:55.641
What the...? Hey

23:55.978 --> 23:57.912
what are you doing here?

23:57.915 --> 23:59.910
Me? What are you doing here?

23:59.936 --> 24:02.520
Uh, bringing Ryan coffee,
and I live here.

24:03.066 --> 24:05.323
- Did you stay the night?
- No. Well,

24:05.357 --> 24:06.920
yeah, kind of.

24:06.947 --> 24:09.020
Can I just have one of these?

24:09.917 --> 24:11.612
You didn't put any
sweetener in, did you?

24:11.617 --> 24:13.750
'Cause I read that aspartame
can cause brain tumors

24:13.755 --> 24:15.412
quicker than you can say
Jack Robinson. Hey.

24:15.417 --> 24:16.682
Taylor.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.262
I was just helping Ryan
with his sleep.

24:19.567 --> 24:21.600
Have you seen him?
He was gone when I woke up.

24:21.606 --> 24:23.750
Hey! I went for a jog. Uh...

24:26.587 --> 24:27.683
Yeah.

24:28.315 --> 24:30.023
It's, uh, this isn't
what it looks like.

24:30.025 --> 24:31.180
Totally.

24:31.786 --> 24:33.432
- Yeah, you know...
- Well, kind of.

24:35.025 --> 24:37.773
We did sleep in the same bed.
No, actually, uh, you slept in the bed.

24:37.775 --> 24:39.393
I was reading in the chair all night.

24:39.398 --> 24:41.120
This is too weird for this early in the morning.

24:41.126 --> 24:42.601
I'm just going to... here.

24:48.536 --> 24:50.720
Well, that was good.

24:50.728 --> 24:54.641
So you really didn't
sleep at all?

24:54.646 --> 24:56.290
Is it because I snored?

24:56.646 --> 24:59.201
My mom always wanted me to get an operation
for a deviated septum.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.522
You didn't snore.

25:01.488 --> 25:04.043
We should talk about what happened
so I can adjust the plan for tonight.

25:04.048 --> 25:06.623
Taylor, look, I appreciate
everything you've done.

25:06.625 --> 25:07.683
I really do.

25:07.687 --> 25:09.433
And I think you're probably
right about Volchok.

25:09.995 --> 25:12.962
But I also think it's something
I need to go through on my own.

25:14.196 --> 25:16.251
So let's call it even, okay?

25:17.847 --> 25:18.983
Okay.

25:19.378 --> 25:20.840
All right.

25:21.168 --> 25:23.151
I'm going to go jump
in the pool.

25:34.385 --> 25:37.562
So what, Sandy just served me up
like a piece of meat?

25:39.006 --> 25:40.550
How rich is he?

25:41.916 --> 25:43.492
5:00 will be fine.

25:45.227 --> 25:46.501
Hi, honey.

25:46.918 --> 25:48.992
You going on a date?
Yes, I'm going to Sandy's

25:48.995 --> 25:51.252
delinquent benefit with a man
called "The Bullet."

25:51.488 --> 25:53.263
Apparently, he owns Texas.

25:53.287 --> 25:55.332
Oh, well, that sounds like fun.

25:56.957 --> 26:00.111
Um, do you think Mr. Cohen
would mind if I crashed?

26:01.097 --> 26:02.790
Yeah, I think that'd be okay.

26:03.028 --> 26:04.510
I'll have to leave you
some cab money.

26:04.518 --> 26:07.022
Well, what if I invited
a friend who drives?

26:07.436 --> 26:09.101
That works, too.

26:09.158 --> 26:11.120
It's nice to see you
interested in charity.

26:13.218 --> 26:14.623
That's me.

26:21.076 --> 26:23.372
Ms. Roberts, the reason we called you in today...

26:23.375 --> 26:24.762
I helped free the bunnies.

26:24.766 --> 26:26.742
I didn't know that they were only
being studied

26:26.748 --> 26:28.153
for how they interacted.

26:28.156 --> 26:29.560
I know it doesn't excuse it.

26:29.568 --> 26:32.481
Well, the board appreciates
your candor.

26:32.485 --> 26:34.880
Can you tell us
who else was involved?

26:35.236 --> 26:36.543
No, I'm sorry.

26:37.386 --> 26:38.592
I see.

26:38.967 --> 26:42.150
There have been other acts
of political activism this semester

26:42.157 --> 26:44.371
that cross the line of legality:

26:44.598 --> 26:47.732
- An incident at the Board of Trustees Dinner...
- I wasn't involved in that.

26:47.808 --> 26:49.420
Do you know who was?

26:50.528 --> 26:52.051
Ms. Roberts,

26:52.055 --> 26:57.093
the severity of your punishment will be influenced
by how cooperative you are today.

26:57.195 --> 26:59.882
Dean-- other deans,

27:00.745 --> 27:03.241
I really, really love Brown.

27:03.646 --> 27:05.990
I have changed so much here.

27:07.516 --> 27:10.590
But I'm afraid if I tell you
who did those other things,

27:11.206 --> 27:13.021
then I'd be betraying the new me,

27:13.537 --> 27:15.101
and I can't do that.

27:17.496 --> 27:19.452
One final question.

27:20.007 --> 27:23.311
- There is still one rabbit missing.
- I don't know anything about that.

27:23.507 --> 27:26.823
Taylor, did you take my lip gloss
with the bee pheromones in it?

27:27.315 --> 27:29.292
It's on the dresser.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.752
Are you okay?

27:33.115 --> 27:34.620
Yeah, peachy.

27:35.587 --> 27:36.743
Talk.

27:38.828 --> 27:41.211
Okay, what do you do when you like a boy

27:41.218 --> 27:43.781
and he barely knows you're alive

27:43.786 --> 27:46.293
and you already pretended to be his sleep therapist

27:46.297 --> 27:48.753
and... I'm out of options?

27:49.388 --> 27:50.982
Okay.

27:51.806 --> 27:53.541
Well, this may sound a little weird,

27:53.556 --> 27:56.682
but try dressing up fabulous

27:56.687 --> 27:58.732
and going to a place where you
know you'll run into him.

27:59.837 --> 28:01.053
That's it?

28:01.057 --> 28:02.263
That's it.

28:02.767 --> 28:05.081
- That really works?
- Almost every time.

28:05.587 --> 28:08.253
And I mean, touching his arm
when you guys are talking

28:08.257 --> 28:12.200
is always good and dancing
and body contact.

28:12.668 --> 28:14.183
And laugh at his jokes.

28:14.186 --> 28:15.951
I mean, even if they're
not that funny.

28:15.957 --> 28:18.673
Ooh, I-I do that already.
Okay, what else?

28:19.528 --> 28:21.490
You could walk in front of him,

28:21.497 --> 28:23.082
I mean, if he's a butt guy.

28:23.625 --> 28:25.761
- I don't know if he's a butt guy.
- Well, it can't hurt.

28:25.767 --> 28:27.671
I mean, girl, you've got a great butt.

28:28.185 --> 28:30.761
You are such a sweetie.
Tell me more.

28:31.898 --> 28:35.920
I just want to thank you again on behalf
of the entire Public Defender's Office.

28:35.925 --> 28:38.541
So please, drink, dance
and have a great time. Thank you.

28:45.595 --> 28:47.050
Hello.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.762
- This is wonderful.
- Thank you.

28:49.788 --> 28:51.773
So how's Julie and The Bullet doing?

28:51.778 --> 28:53.391
See for yourself.

28:53.395 --> 28:56.502
So there was this big, white-tailed Texas deer

28:56.507 --> 28:58.402
coming across there, so I wheel around like

28:58.406 --> 28:59.910
- Dick Cheney and go... bang!
- Oh!

29:02.377 --> 29:04.180
I got him. Bang!

29:30.827 --> 29:32.230
Bonjour Ryan.

29:32.248 --> 29:34.050
Taylor, salut.
Tu est, hum...

29:34.056 --> 29:35.621
Je suis belle?

29:35.846 --> 29:37.510
Belle, ouai, c'est le mot
que je cherchai.

29:37.517 --> 29:38.942
Et bien, toi aussi.

29:39.026 --> 29:42.040
- Sa te dirais de danser?
- En fait, je suis pas trop un danseur.

29:42.236 --> 29:43.672
Ca doit probablement
te choquer.

29:43.677 --> 29:45.980
Peut être que cet exercice
va te fatigué.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.741
C'est pas de la thérapie.

29:47.747 --> 29:49.491
Non, on fait plus ça maintenant.

29:49.498 --> 29:51.571
C'est juste, tu sais,
de l'amusement.

29:53.985 --> 29:55.381
Ouai, Ok.

29:55.736 --> 29:56.933
Ok.

30:08.475 --> 30:10.152
Okay, just a second.

30:13.006 --> 30:14.611
He wants to talk numbers Monday.

30:14.616 --> 30:16.241
- Who?
- The Bullet. He's getting drinks.

30:16.245 --> 30:18.371
But he's in, Kiki.
He loves New Match.

30:18.377 --> 30:19.720
- That's great.
- I know.

30:20.917 --> 30:22.643
- Mom.
- Kaitlin.

30:22.648 --> 30:24.351
Look at who I brought with me.

30:26.228 --> 30:27.862
What are you doing here?

30:29.335 --> 30:31.302
You said your mom
told you to bring me.

30:32.607 --> 30:35.053
- Uh, Julie, what's going on?
- Is that your date?

30:37.898 --> 30:39.610
You and I will talk later.

30:39.615 --> 30:42.351
- Bullet, this is...
- What the hell are you doing here, boy?

30:42.987 --> 30:44.583
You know each other?

30:44.587 --> 30:46.163
You're on a date with my dad?

30:46.285 --> 30:47.752
- What?
- What?

30:47.756 --> 30:48.870
Oh, God.

30:55.385 --> 30:57.032
You ditching my party already?

30:57.476 --> 30:59.203
I was thinking about calling Summer.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.711
I'm not supposed to call her until 10:03,

31:01.718 --> 31:02.890
but technically,

31:02.898 --> 31:06.290
it is 10:03 on the East Coast,
so that's not cheating, is it?

31:06.298 --> 31:07.331
Sorry, Seth.

31:07.338 --> 31:09.163
I'd say, yeah, that'd be cheating.

31:09.495 --> 31:11.961
Hey, did I see Taylor leaving
the pool house this morning?

31:12.516 --> 31:16.173
Yeah, she's pretending to be Ryan's sleep therapist
so he falls in love with her.

31:16.535 --> 31:18.013
That's new.

31:18.408 --> 31:20.491
That'd explain the way
they're dancing in there.

31:21.356 --> 31:22.922
I hope it works out.

31:23.417 --> 31:25.450
You're supporting
this seduction plot?

31:25.458 --> 31:28.472
Well, you don't have to be a shrink
to see that Ryan's still working through things.

31:29.367 --> 31:32.641
You know, I think he could use the
human connection.

31:32.646 --> 31:34.170
Yeah, but those two...

31:34.175 --> 31:35.321
I don't know.

31:35.326 --> 31:37.142
Well, they're not the most obvious couple,

31:37.738 --> 31:40.263
but then neither were you
and Summer once upon a time.

31:42.097 --> 31:43.842
And Taylor thinks Ryan is funny.

32:03.086 --> 32:05.783
- We-we did not hate you.
- Oh, you totally hated me.

32:06.095 --> 32:08.720
Come on, you were probably the president
of the "We Hate Taylor Club."

32:08.728 --> 32:11.201
I was the secretary.
I took the notes.

32:11.205 --> 32:13.080
Ryan, you made a real joke.

32:13.086 --> 32:15.363
Yeah, well, a pretty bad one.
But I made a real joke.

32:15.378 --> 32:17.501
Thank you, but don't tell anyone.

32:27.158 --> 32:28.681
You want a drink?

32:28.686 --> 32:30.542
- That'd be nice.
- Okay.

32:33.958 --> 32:35.240
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:35.247 --> 32:36.901
I saw you dancing with Taylor.

32:36.906 --> 32:39.062
Yeah, is that look supposed to mean
something or...?

32:39.065 --> 32:40.712
Crazier things have happened.

32:40.978 --> 32:42.672
Nothing I can recall this instant, but...

32:42.678 --> 32:44.513
- Okay, I don't think so.
- Ask yourself why.

32:44.517 --> 32:47.240
She's smart, she's funny.
Dude, just forget about it, okay?

32:47.247 --> 32:48.903
I'm not going to date Taylor.

32:51.605 --> 32:53.353
Um, I was just...

32:57.678 --> 32:59.231
Excuse me.

33:08.857 --> 33:10.792
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor...

33:10.795 --> 33:12.183
Hold on, let me explain.

33:12.187 --> 33:14.002
Oh, I think you were pretty clear, Ryan.

33:14.005 --> 33:17.682
And, yes, I lied when you asked me if I liked you.

33:17.688 --> 33:18.732
But...

33:20.565 --> 33:22.222
What was I even thinking?

33:22.228 --> 33:23.843
I an, you and me...

33:23.966 --> 33:26.712
- I must be totally crazy.
- You're not crazy, okay?

33:26.715 --> 33:30.162
Ryan, I pretended to be a sleep therapist to seduce you.

33:30.525 --> 33:32.393
- That was crazy.
- Don't worry, because I'm sure

33:32.397 --> 33:35.133
next week I'll be totally obsessed with some guy who
gives me change for parking.

33:35.136 --> 33:37.453
Look, what I said has absolutely
nothing to do with you, okay?

33:37.458 --> 33:39.251
- It's just...
- What?

33:39.825 --> 33:42.570
That for the longest time all
you could feel was your desire

33:42.575 --> 33:44.333
to kill Volchok, now that's gone,

33:44.336 --> 33:45.601
so you feel empty.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.783
You can't feel anything,
least of all anything for me.

33:47.788 --> 33:49.593
How do you keep doing that?

33:49.807 --> 33:51.211
- Doing what?
- That

33:51.216 --> 33:54.101
you keep telling me what I'm thinking
before I feel it.

33:54.427 --> 33:56.361
Because I think about you.

33:56.815 --> 33:59.421
You know, I want you to be happy, and

34:00.128 --> 34:02.101
I think that if you gave it a chance,

34:02.106 --> 34:03.930
you might feel something, too.

34:05.486 --> 34:06.782
Taylor...

34:07.827 --> 34:10.081
Are you going to tell me that
you really like me as a friend?

34:11.458 --> 34:12.841
Maybe.

34:16.976 --> 34:18.713
How does she do that?

34:19.877 --> 34:22.202
Do you have any idea what
you just did in there?

34:22.208 --> 34:23.922
Screwed up things with
your new boyfriend?

34:23.928 --> 34:25.322
Thought you were all, "I'm off men.

34:25.335 --> 34:27.190
I'm going to start focusing
on the new business."

34:27.197 --> 34:30.130
That was about business, Kaitlin.
That man was going to give us money,

34:30.136 --> 34:32.973
money that we need.
Then why'd you have to hook up with Spencer?

34:33.087 --> 34:34.960
I mean, couldn't you see that I liked him?

34:35.178 --> 34:38.152
He's ten years older than you,
and no, I couldn't see that.

34:38.158 --> 34:40.492
- Well, I was flirting with him.
- You flirt with everybody.

34:40.496 --> 34:42.489
- So do you.
- You're 15 years old.

34:42.536 --> 34:43.831
And you're my mother.

34:43.837 --> 34:47.422
I don't have to see guys sneaking down the stairs
while I'm trying to eat breakfast.

34:47.487 --> 34:49.290
- It makes me want to barf.
- That...

34:52.016 --> 34:53.952
That is completely fair.

34:53.966 --> 34:55.920
Oh, my God, honey.

34:55.928 --> 34:58.390
What is wrong with me?
I am so sorry.

34:59.136 --> 35:00.543
It's okay.

35:01.147 --> 35:02.871
Just try to pick one guy.

35:03.135 --> 35:05.031
One that I don't like.

35:07.846 --> 35:10.160
How did you know that
Spencer was Bullet's son?

35:10.275 --> 35:12.512
- I didn't.
- It was just coincidence?

35:13.956 --> 35:15.500
That's weird.

35:22.545 --> 35:25.110
- Summer, hey. What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.

35:25.117 --> 35:27.272
Have you been talking to the board
this whole time?

35:28.988 --> 35:33.553
Summer, have I accomplished
anything this semester?

35:33.556 --> 35:37.562
Are you kidding? Che, there would be no political
activism at Brown without you.

35:38.437 --> 35:42.513
- Oh, my God, are you getting kicked out?
- No, no, but I think you might be.

35:42.715 --> 35:44.022
What?

35:44.696 --> 35:46.343
Yeah, they needed a scapegoat.

35:46.346 --> 35:48.900
You said yourself, I'm too important
to the movement, so...

35:48.906 --> 35:50.341
What did you tell them, Che?

35:50.348 --> 35:53.762
Uh, just that you flooded the trustee's dinner,

35:53.885 --> 35:57.092
and disabled the maintenance vehicles in October...

35:57.096 --> 35:59.652
And, well, there's a whole list of stuff.

35:59.655 --> 36:02.982
I was only going to say a couple, but then, you know,
I thought, if Summer's going down anyways...

36:03.508 --> 36:05.260
may as well have her go down in style.

36:05.265 --> 36:08.093
Well, Che, you did all of those things and I protected you.

36:08.098 --> 36:08.903
I know.

36:09.386 --> 36:11.032
And the movement will never forget it.

36:11.035 --> 36:13.450
Shut up about the movement, okay?
This is not Cuba.

36:13.456 --> 36:15.692
We are in college. We have dining cards.

36:15.777 --> 36:17.842
- I'm going to get kicked out.
- Caterpillar.

36:17.847 --> 36:20.100
No, okay, don't call me that.
Okay, just stay away from me.

36:23.548 --> 36:25.080
Well, fine.

36:25.536 --> 36:28.441
Fine. You'll have your money tomorrow.

36:28.467 --> 36:29.940
Senators.

36:30.205 --> 36:32.743
Well, if it's not the little pot stirrer.

36:32.748 --> 36:35.210
Have you seen my idiot son?
He's probably somewhere banging

36:35.218 --> 36:37.823
- his head against the wall.
- Dude, no one cares that he's your son.

36:38.386 --> 36:40.290
You should invest in my mother's business.

36:40.296 --> 36:41.880
Or what?
You going to tell everyone

36:41.885 --> 36:45.171
what a meanie old Bullet is and I'm going
to have to sit alone at lunch?

36:45.517 --> 36:46.901
Oh, boo-hoo, boo-hoo.

36:46.916 --> 36:48.431
My mother is awesome.

36:48.437 --> 36:50.101
She ran the Newport Group.

36:50.107 --> 36:53.443
And when she broke up with her
fiancee, she got his house.

36:53.677 --> 36:55.210
She'll make you a lot of money.

36:55.218 --> 36:56.901
Already got a lot of money, squirt.

36:57.445 --> 37:00.332
- Just thought it might be some fun.
- Well, if that's all you're in for,

37:00.335 --> 37:01.840
then knowing my mother,

37:01.845 --> 37:05.003
will be the best investment
you've ever made.

37:06.327 --> 37:09.660
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

37:15.236 --> 37:16.752
- Tired?
- Exhausted.

37:16.797 --> 37:18.633
Hey, how'd it go with the Bullet?

37:18.645 --> 37:22.682
Well, as it turns out, Julie was
dating his 25-year-old son.

37:23.668 --> 37:25.953
- That's a weird coincidence.
- That about sums it up.

37:25.957 --> 37:28.880
Sandy, mind if I borrow your wife for a second?

37:29.927 --> 37:31.900
Come on, blondie, I won't bite.

37:38.186 --> 37:41.042
- Hey, you ready to go home?
- Yeah. Where's Spencer?

37:41.116 --> 37:44.560
I figured you guys would have made up
and he'd be showing you his half volley.

37:44.565 --> 37:48.960
I told him it's over and that if he ever came
near you again, I would crush him.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.333
Julie?

37:51.007 --> 37:52.180
We're back on.

37:52.188 --> 37:53.982
Bullet wants to come by
the office on Monday.

37:54.078 --> 37:57.123
- What?
- Apparently Kaitlin can be quite persuasive.

37:58.257 --> 37:59.703
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

38:00.968 --> 38:03.110
Yeah, I got game.

38:04.468 --> 38:06.441
- You want to get some ice cream?
- I stopped eating.

38:07.408 --> 38:08.860
What the hell.

38:08.875 --> 38:12.510
- The guy at the ice cream store is so hot.
- That's my girl.

38:20.458 --> 38:21.991
Well, close enough.

38:21.996 --> 38:23.082
Seth.

38:23.816 --> 38:26.401
Taylor, what are you doing in here?

38:26.407 --> 38:30.713
When I had really bad insomnia last year,
a Chinese doctor gave me this herbal tea.

38:31.325 --> 38:33.273
And I thought it might help Ryan sleep.

38:33.526 --> 38:36.361
I would have given it to him before,
but I was trying to seduce him. So...

38:36.928 --> 38:38.561
So why can't you just give it to him?

38:39.025 --> 38:40.751
Because I'm too embarrassed.

38:41.328 --> 38:45.963
You were totally right. Here I am, getting a divorce,
I'm living like a refugee at Julie's.

38:45.966 --> 38:48.771
Ryan's nice to me so I fall for him?

38:48.778 --> 38:50.672
It's just totally pathetic.

38:51.258 --> 38:53.023
Just please give that to him.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.621
Wow, I never thought I'd see you quitting.

38:58.748 --> 39:01.151
Well, it's completely hopeless, Seth. You heard him.

39:01.158 --> 39:03.770
Yeah, I know, just you're
rolling over like an old dog.

39:03.778 --> 39:05.551
Not the Taylor I remember.

39:05.555 --> 39:07.802
Are you seriously trying
to Jedi mind trick me?

39:07.805 --> 39:09.933
Taylor Townsend, quitter.

39:09.945 --> 39:11.711
I guess I'll just have
to get used to that.

39:15.316 --> 39:16.401
Fine.

39:25.477 --> 39:26.863
Hello.

39:26.868 --> 39:27.871
Hey.

39:27.877 --> 39:30.240
Hey. Summer, I was just about to call you.

39:30.247 --> 39:31.750
- Oh, you were?
- Yeah.

39:31.755 --> 39:33.931
I wanted to call you, but I
didn't want to seem needy.

39:33.935 --> 39:35.782
Are you kidding? I been wanting
to call you all week.

39:37.798 --> 39:40.360
Seth, you still love me, right?

39:40.486 --> 39:42.232
Of course I do.
What's going on?

39:43.816 --> 39:45.490
Well...

39:46.695 --> 39:48.273
I got a rabbit.

39:49.468 --> 39:50.993
Okay.

39:50.998 --> 39:53.070
What's its name?

39:53.347 --> 39:55.670
Wait, no, let me guess.

39:55.676 --> 39:58.012
- Is it Cyclotron?
- No.

39:58.026 --> 40:01.381
Are you lying?
Is it, uh, Gorgon

40:01.388 --> 40:02.901
the Destroyer of Carrots?

40:02.906 --> 40:04.843
- No.
- Is it Larry?

40:04.845 --> 40:06.093
Larry?

40:06.518 --> 40:08.291
You're not Larry.

40:16.438 --> 40:17.621
Hi.

40:17.625 --> 40:18.712
Hey.

40:19.265 --> 40:20.581
Um, I brought you some tea.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.611
I'm not trying to be your therapist again.

40:22.617 --> 40:24.683
I just thought it might help you sleep.

40:24.688 --> 40:26.182
Oh, thanks.

40:31.188 --> 40:33.270
Oh, God, what am I doing.

40:33.276 --> 40:35.822
Wait, hold on.
Look, I've got to say something.

40:37.665 --> 40:40.451
I think you've got this idea that
you're this strange person

40:40.456 --> 40:42.363
that has to trick people
into liking you.

40:42.378 --> 40:44.050
That's not true.
You're, um...

40:44.566 --> 40:46.211
You're amazing.

40:50.028 --> 40:51.590
Oh, my God. You just did it to me.

40:51.597 --> 40:54.691
Did what?
You said exactly what I was feeling.

40:54.696 --> 40:57.000
Well, except for the amazing part.

40:58.275 --> 41:00.250
Well, it's true.

41:00.697 --> 41:03.520
Honestly, you know, I wish
I did feel something.

41:06.175 --> 41:07.632
Kiss me.

41:07.635 --> 41:08.831
Uh, what?

41:08.836 --> 41:10.552
I think there's something there.

41:10.776 --> 41:13.393
And I think that if you kiss me
you'll feel it, too.

41:13.395 --> 41:15.991
- I think we already did that.
- Nope, uh-uh.

41:16.168 --> 41:18.202
You kissed me,
I didn't kiss you.

41:19.188 --> 41:21.441
Come on. Just... If you don't feel anything,

41:21.457 --> 41:23.420
I will never mention it again.

41:24.188 --> 41:26.433
That's the best deal you'll ever get.
Ask Seth.

41:27.277 --> 41:28.331
Just one kiss.

41:30.868 --> 41:32.332
One kiss.

41:34.398 --> 41:35.602
- One kiss.
- Okay.

41:35.615 --> 41:36.952
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:36.958 --> 41:38.892
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:57.145 --> 41:58.691
I'm sorry.

42:17.565 --> 42:18.992
Whoa.

42:21.738 --> 42:24.061
Thanks for talking to me, Cohen.
I really miss you.

42:24.155 --> 42:25.901
Get some sleep,
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

42:25.906 --> 42:27.681
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

42:43.415 --> 42:45.471
Hey, I figured you'd be up.
