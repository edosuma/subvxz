WEBVTT

00:01.793 --> 00:03.000
With Pentecost tomorrow,

00:03.128 --> 00:05.791
I believe our killer
will be compelled to act.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.209
We plan on using a decoy.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.087
Do not betray your own kind,
Roosevelt.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.385
You'll find yourself
with no friends.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.555
You have no right to live
among decent people.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.053
I'm a Van Bergen!
You're a nobody!

00:23.649 --> 00:25.168
You don't have the courage
to see yourself

00:25.192 --> 00:28.230
for who you really are
because you're a coward.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.655
I can take you away.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.241
Stop him!

00:42.292 --> 00:43.578
Cyrus?

00:43.710 --> 00:45.042
- Where is he?
- He got away.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.539
Is that closer, Stevie?

01:23.667 --> 01:25.659
No.
That ain't him neither.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.588
Are you quite sure the eyes
weren't further apart?

01:30.716 --> 01:32.316
No. I told you.
The eyes were bunched up.

01:32.384 --> 01:33.653
The forehead was as big
as a wall.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.964
That could have been the angle
you saw him from.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.881
- He was a tall man.
- Don't put words in his mouth.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.661
The one thing I know better
than you is how to draw.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.017
The drawings may be yours,

01:43.145 --> 01:45.057
but it's Stevie who saw
the man's face, not you.

01:45.188 --> 01:48.272
Listen to what he tells you.
Don't tell him what he saw.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.642
He's telling me what he saw.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.143
But you're not listening.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.736
You're drawing
what you want to draw.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.196
Why don't you draw it, then?

01:55.324 --> 01:58.237
All that's required is you put
aside your preconceived notions

01:58.368 --> 02:00.305
of who the killer is and just
listen to what's being...

02:00.329 --> 02:01.661
I am listening!

02:01.788 --> 02:02.949
Stop!

02:05.584 --> 02:06.995
Stop it!

02:11.465 --> 02:13.673
We ain't gonna find nobody
like this.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.820
Doctor, do you not find it
ironic that an immigrant child

02:39.951 --> 02:41.638
was left at the foot
of Lady Liberty herself?!

02:41.662 --> 02:42.698
Doctor!

02:58.345 --> 02:59.836
You can't be in here.

02:59.971 --> 03:03.590
Mr. Tuthill, it's all right.
They're here at my request.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.400
Has the child been identified?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.191
His name is Ernst Lohmann.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.071
He called himself Rosie.

03:22.661 --> 03:25.449
He worked at the brothel
we were watching.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.247
As we've observed
with the others,

03:28.375 --> 03:30.458
removal of the genitalia,

03:30.585 --> 03:32.827
severing of the right hand
above the wrist,

03:32.963 --> 03:35.626
both ulna and radius
cleanly cut,

03:35.757 --> 03:37.419
massive damage to the thorax,

03:37.551 --> 03:40.214
with lateral lacerations
to the abdomen.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.096
He only cut out one eye.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.716
Perhaps he was interrupted.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.637
He's taken his heart.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.774
That's new.

03:56.027 --> 03:59.236
Also, he's removed
this section of scalp

03:59.364 --> 04:01.777
covering the parietal bone.

04:01.908 --> 04:02.989
Scalped.

04:03.118 --> 04:06.236
I've only ever seen the likes
of that out West.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.657
What did you say?

04:11.793 --> 04:15.127
I saw something similar when
I was ranching in the Dakotas.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.872
I had the misfortune
to look upon the corpses

04:18.007 --> 04:22.878
of several white men mutilated
after an Indian massacre.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.970
Look at the body, please.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.181
Are you sure what you saw
was similar?

04:34.941 --> 04:37.433
Similar, yes.
The eyes.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.607
The lower parts.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.107
Of course.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.826
After you've finished,
re-examine the correspondence

04:50.957 --> 04:53.665
we received from the mental
hospitals, the asylums.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.354
Look for any mention of patients
with a connection to the West...

04:56.379 --> 04:58.996
Indians, settlers,
laborers on the railroad.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.294
We make no distinction...
not yet.

05:03.553 --> 05:06.717
Miss Howard will be needed
to assist them.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.215
Now if I may have a moment
alone.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.731
You who have no children.
You have no soul.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.394
He has no children of his own,

07:23.526 --> 07:26.940
so he must use the children of
others to prove his crazy ideas!

07:27.072 --> 07:28.904
Our children!

07:44.381 --> 07:45.872
Get in.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.294
Good morning, gentlemen.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.849
What happened?

07:57.978 --> 08:01.562
Another kid was gutted, this
time right under our noses.

08:03.692 --> 08:06.651
It wasn't Van Bergen
what done it.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.110
Not him?

08:08.238 --> 08:11.447
Uh, the... the... the timing.

08:11.574 --> 08:14.783
It... don't fit right.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.493
He was already...

08:16.997 --> 08:19.660
He was already what?

08:20.291 --> 08:21.657
Well, speak up, man.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.335
'Twas an accident.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.544
What did you do to him?!

08:35.140 --> 08:37.381
Keep an eye on him, I said!

08:37.517 --> 08:39.383
What do I pay you for, anyway?!
Jesus!

08:39.519 --> 08:40.726
Don't worry.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.890
Chief, he won't be found.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.730
I took care of it!

09:02.375 --> 09:06.585
Let me tell you how this city
is run, you stupid mick.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.542
We serve the rich.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.719
And in return, they raise us
above the primordial filth.

09:16.347 --> 09:21.058
And God help us if we don't keep
our end of the bargain.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.894
You see, to them...

09:25.607 --> 09:29.226
...you and me are nothing
but dumb animals...

09:29.944 --> 09:31.606
...no better than the lowlifes

09:31.738 --> 09:34.947
and the tenement scum
we protect them from.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.739
It don't matter that they...
that they got soft hands

09:38.870 --> 09:41.863
and that they dress
in silk bloomers.

09:43.792 --> 09:47.957
So long as they have money,
we do their bidding.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.963
And if you don't, they'll pay
someone twice your size

09:55.095 --> 09:56.631
to sink you to the bottom
of the river,

09:56.763 --> 09:59.346
like you no doubt done
to their son.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.266
Chief.

10:17.826 --> 10:21.445
So don't tell me that
you bloody took care of it.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.632
Can I drop you gentlemen
somewhere?

10:39.764 --> 10:42.427
The Natural History Museum
if it's convenient.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.721
- 77th and...
- I know where it is.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.762
West 77th and Central Park,
Jack.

10:47.897 --> 10:48.897
You got it, boss.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.777
I once read a monograph
you wrote.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.067
I even understood some of it.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.065
Is that what we're here
to discuss?

11:00.201 --> 11:03.990
"The Harm We Do to Our Children
Is Revisited on Ourselves."

11:04.664 --> 11:05.996
Catchy title.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.533
Have you children, Mr. Kelly?

11:09.127 --> 11:12.791
I count all the poor
of the Five Points as mine.

11:12.922 --> 11:17.383
Abused by their betters,
swindled by Wall Street,

11:17.510 --> 11:20.173
shunned by the swells
on Millionaires Row.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.888
I was proud of my people
back there.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.598
They've gotten off their knees
for once.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.017
But you know how mobs can be.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.353
Arranged by yourself, no doubt.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.346
Oh.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.143
You're looking a little more
chipper than last time we met.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.769
Where was that again?

11:39.657 --> 11:41.990
In this case,
what do we owe you for the ride,

11:42.118 --> 11:44.485
other than our gratitude?

11:44.621 --> 11:45.828
Whoa there!

11:45.955 --> 11:49.369
Well, now that you're asking...

11:50.293 --> 11:51.704
...you could deliver
a gentle word

11:51.836 --> 11:54.374
into the ear of your friend
Mr. Roosevelt.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.710
He keeps my brothels shut down
any longer,

11:57.842 --> 11:59.674
and he will have hell to to pay.

12:00.178 --> 12:05.173
You can let him know... the
rioting today was just a taster.

12:05.308 --> 12:09.643
It was our idea to close
the brothels, Mr. Kelly.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.101
Sure.
I know.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.059
And I applaud your efforts.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.938
So let me tell you, Doctor.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.907
You are fighting a monster,

12:24.035 --> 12:25.776
one that reaches
from Millionaires' Mile

12:25.912 --> 12:28.245
all the way down
to Mulberry Street.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.827
And if you're not careful,

12:30.959 --> 12:35.044
it will devour you long before
you find your child killer.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.337
Excuse us
for being late, Miss Howard.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.818
Let's get started.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.983
Here's the correspondence
from the mental hospitals

13:02.115 --> 13:04.107
that the doctor wanted us
to re-examine.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.693
Shall we?

13:08.621 --> 13:11.489
I hope you're not implying
the native customs

13:11.624 --> 13:14.332
have anything to do
with these murders.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.167
I mean, we have got
already enough trouble

13:16.296 --> 13:19.255
changing the public view
of the natives.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.965
That's what we've come
to find out, Franz.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.797
My own knowledge
about the Plains tribes

13:24.929 --> 13:26.511
is poorly inefficient,

13:26.639 --> 13:29.928
but I have a young colleague
who may be able to help you.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.978
What is it?

13:39.652 --> 13:43.521
A detailed description,
uh, from an asylum inmate

13:43.656 --> 13:46.319
who witnessed the battlefield
after Little Bighorn.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.321
Well, read it aloud.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.618
He's too old to be our man.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.739
Besides, he's still locked up.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.532
Please don't look at me
like that.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.586
Or each other.

14:11.934 --> 14:15.268
"The bodies were heaped
around four great boulders.

14:15.396 --> 14:20.266
I saw eyeballs torn out
and smeared on the rocks.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.063
Brains too.

14:22.195 --> 14:26.030
Noses and ears were hacked off
and entrails exposed.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.410
General Custer's body lay
in the middle of the carnage.

14:31.537 --> 14:35.247
His thighs had been slashed
to the bone, his ears slit.

14:35.375 --> 14:39.369
And at least a dozen arrows
pierced his groin."

14:40.338 --> 14:42.250
Castration and mutilation
of the genitals

14:42.382 --> 14:43.463
were quite common.

14:43.591 --> 14:47.676
The Sioux believed that
each man's nagi, his spirit,

14:47.804 --> 14:49.966
entered the afterlife
in the exact same form

14:50.098 --> 14:51.555
he left the world at his death.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.425
So if a warrior truly hated
his enemy,

14:54.560 --> 14:56.973
he'd chop off his manhood
to prevent him from enjoying

14:57.105 --> 14:59.472
the pleasures of copulation
in the spirit world.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.223
Spirits copulate?

15:01.359 --> 15:04.443
I, uh, suppose there's
not much else to do.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.570
Hm.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.820
What about the eyes?

15:06.948 --> 15:09.611
The belief is the nagi has to
take a perilous journey

15:09.742 --> 15:11.153
to reach the spirit world.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.493
If the eyes are missing,
they can't find their way

15:13.621 --> 15:16.159
and thus will be forced
to return to our world

15:16.290 --> 15:19.078
and wander forever
as a lost and forlorn ghost.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.076
Of course,
that's one big difference

15:21.212 --> 15:23.329
with the mutilations
you're investigating.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.173
And that is?

15:25.299 --> 15:26.756
Children.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.215
No self-respecting Plains Indian
would ever commit

15:30.346 --> 15:32.929
this kind of ritual mutilation
on a child.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.925
It would mean admitting you
considered the child a threat,

15:36.060 --> 15:39.269
and that would be deemed, uh,
shameful and cowardly.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.889
Then you don't believe
that our mutilations

15:42.024 --> 15:43.390
were part of an Indian ritual?

15:43.526 --> 15:46.815
To anyone who understands
the culture, most decidedly not.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.609
What about someone who doesn't
understand the culture,

15:49.740 --> 15:52.608
someone who has perhaps
witnessed mutilations

15:52.743 --> 15:55.326
such as these
without knowing what they mean?

15:55.455 --> 15:58.448
Then I'd say they would apply
to them their own meaning.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.787
"Dirtier than a red Injun."

16:01.919 --> 16:04.002
It's in the letter he wrote
to Mrs. Santorelli.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.497
He's witnessed these things,
probably as a child,

16:06.632 --> 16:09.420
since there's been no account
of a massacre for 20 years.

16:09.552 --> 16:10.838
Not by Indians, anyway.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.461
And Van Bergen was never
out West.

16:12.597 --> 16:13.883
Exactly.

16:14.015 --> 16:17.008
We blundered last night, John,
but we're getting closer.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.246
Miss Joanna?

16:44.045 --> 16:46.583
I'm glad you were able
to get here so quickly.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.047
Miss Joanna would make you
Mr. Laszlo.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.751
Miss Crawford.
How is he?

16:51.886 --> 16:54.094
He was asking
if you'd been to visit.

16:54.222 --> 16:55.929
I brought him some food.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.891
The fare at hospitals
can be less than flavorful.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.063
Cyrus told me
you've found employment.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.648
Yes, at <i>The Philadelphia
Tribune.</i>

17:07.777 --> 17:09.063
Excellent.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.685
They only pay me by the article,

17:10.820 --> 17:12.436
but I'll be able
to reimburse you soon.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.483
The money I gave Cyrus
for your education

17:15.617 --> 17:17.609
requires no repayment.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.486
The service he's provided me
over the years

17:19.622 --> 17:21.079
is quite sufficient.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.911
You mean nearly getting himself
killed?

17:26.753 --> 17:29.713
I see I have offended you
without knowing why.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.254
You could have released him from
your services a long time ago.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.093
That was your decision to make.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.510
I have as much need of him
as he has of me.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.758
More, I'd say.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.102
I was speaking of friendship.

17:44.230 --> 17:48.941
Your friend spends most
of his time in the stables.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.693
My uncle may take
acts of kindness

17:51.821 --> 17:54.063
as a mark of your decency,

17:54.198 --> 17:56.190
but I see keeping him
downtrodden

17:56.325 --> 17:58.282
through courtesy
and progressive ideas

17:58.411 --> 18:02.075
as simply more effective
than using shackles and a whip.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.618
Thank you for letting me know
about my uncle, Doctor.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.370
And thank you as well
for paying for my schooling.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.623
I still intend to reimburse you.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.328
- Here's another one.
- In the same hospital?

19:25.456 --> 19:27.163
Of the patients who match
our description

19:27.291 --> 19:28.977
that have spent time in
the West, these four were sent

19:29.001 --> 19:30.867
to St. Elizabeth's Hospital
in Washington.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.744
Look at this one.

19:33.673 --> 19:37.041
Rudolf Bunzl...
released and later committed

19:37.176 --> 19:40.544
to Blackwell's Island
right here in the city.

19:41.055 --> 19:43.172
That means they'll have records
on him.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.014
I've asked Mary
to vacate her room

19:53.150 --> 19:55.230
so you'd have a more comfortable
place to convalesce.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.855
Mm.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.609
I'd like to thank you both
for your help.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.031
Frankly, it was more than help.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.078
You've put yourselves
at great risk.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.998
What I mean to say is that I
take responsibility for the fact

20:14.130 --> 20:16.167
that you came so close to...

20:21.971 --> 20:25.135
What I really mean to say
is that, uh...

20:25.266 --> 20:27.053
I apologize.

20:30.688 --> 20:34.523
I feel I've taken your loyalty
and trust for granted.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.152
Doctor.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.149
You don't have to apologize.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.573
Right, Stevie?

20:48.289 --> 20:49.655
Right.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.868
Well...

20:55.921 --> 20:57.787
...I hope you'll be comfortable.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.637
Egg cream, please.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.055
Mm-hmm.
Coming up.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.334
John.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.836
John?

22:22.216 --> 22:24.048
Laszlo?

22:24.844 --> 22:26.836
You've been chloroformed.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.258
I could smell it
when I got in the wagon.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.677
By whom, I don't know.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.852
Whoa!

22:54.498 --> 22:57.366
What happened to your uniform,
Captain?

23:00.129 --> 23:01.836
Go on.
Get, society boy.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.755
Well, Laszlo,
it seems we find ourselves

23:45.883 --> 23:48.842
in the presence
of a great many sainted men.

23:51.138 --> 23:54.131
Dr. Kreizler, we are
aware of your investigation

23:54.266 --> 23:58.385
and demand that you
and your colleagues desist.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.182
Yes.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.643
Bishop Potter, I wonder why you,

24:02.775 --> 24:05.392
a leader of the church
and a pillar of the community,

24:05.527 --> 24:06.984
would want to stop us
in our quest

24:07.112 --> 24:09.479
to find the perpetrator
of these terrible murders.

24:09.615 --> 24:12.528
Because it's a matter
for the police.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.619
The man responsible
for these crimes

24:16.747 --> 24:18.079
has been active for some time,

24:18.207 --> 24:22.247
but the police seem to be unable
or unwilling to stop him.

24:22.378 --> 24:25.997
Some of the victims were killed
during your tenure, Mr. Byrnes.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.174
Not a day goes by in this city

24:30.302 --> 24:33.966
without some little grifter
being found dead on misery lane.

24:34.098 --> 24:35.464
Murder is murder.

24:35.599 --> 24:38.433
Not when it leads to the door
of an innocent man.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.426
Willem Van Bergen did not commit
these murders.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.019
Of that I'm quite certain.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.730
Oh, no. That's a lie.
He don't believe that.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.771
No, you and criminals
like Paul Kelly,

24:47.903 --> 24:51.237
along with the agitators and
the socialists on his payroll,

24:51.365 --> 24:52.651
are subverting the law.

24:52.783 --> 24:55.446
My only concern is that
of seven dead children.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.069
Gentlemen.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.167
Gentlemen.

25:07.131 --> 25:10.670
Do you know why I collect art?

25:12.511 --> 25:16.050
It persuades me that the world
is a more beautiful place

25:16.181 --> 25:18.138
than I know it to be.

25:18.267 --> 25:21.681
I take comfort
in that which I can understand.

25:22.563 --> 25:26.682
And a man who kills
for no apparent reason

25:26.817 --> 25:29.150
is beyond my comprehension.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.361
Mr. Morgan...

25:31.864 --> 25:33.901
...you are a pioneer
in your field.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.446
You've turned finance
into a science.

25:36.577 --> 25:39.411
I hope to do the same
for the human mind,

25:39.538 --> 25:42.030
criminal or otherwise.

25:42.166 --> 25:45.580
By looking at the man's methods,
his appetites, and his victims,

25:45.711 --> 25:47.577
I believe I can build
a clear enough picture

25:47.713 --> 25:52.378
to understand his motives
and thereby capture him.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.796
Hm.

26:03.771 --> 26:07.310
Bishop Potter, may I suggest
that you take your leave

26:07.441 --> 26:09.603
and talk to the family
of the boy in question?

26:09.735 --> 26:13.820
Let them know that their son
is no longer under suspicion.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.784
It's the least we can do...

26:21.789 --> 26:24.577
...seeing as how
these false accusations

26:24.708 --> 26:27.746
have forced the boy to flee
the country.

26:29.004 --> 26:32.088
Mr. Byrnes, why don't you
accompany the bishop?

26:32.216 --> 26:34.096
I'm sure the family
would like a reassuring word

26:34.134 --> 26:36.000
from you as well.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.136
Hmm?

26:54.947 --> 26:59.066
Doctor, your beliefs...
are interesting.

27:00.077 --> 27:04.993
I believe there are two reasons
why a man does what he does...

27:05.124 --> 27:09.038
the good reason
and the real reason.

27:09.169 --> 27:11.001
Then why don't you tell us
the real reason

27:11.130 --> 27:13.668
why you forced us here?

27:16.218 --> 27:18.505
This city is changing.

27:18.637 --> 27:22.551
In four years' time, we'll be
entering the 20th century,

27:22.683 --> 27:25.266
and New York is poised to become

27:25.394 --> 27:28.887
the greatest economic powerhouse
this world has ever seen.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.144
But to do so...

27:33.944 --> 27:36.982
...we need
a compliant workforce.

27:38.866 --> 27:40.823
The civil unrest caused
by these murders

27:40.951 --> 27:44.115
troubles me a great deal...
a great deal indeed.

27:44.246 --> 27:47.956
Possibly even more
than the murders themselves.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.542
A harsh truth
but a truth nonetheless.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.380
Would you like a lemonade,
Mr. Moore?

27:56.008 --> 27:58.170
No.
Thank you.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.557
What happened?

28:14.693 --> 28:16.980
It looks as though
that fat son of a bitch

28:17.112 --> 28:21.356
is going to let that alienist
continue with his investigation.

28:24.494 --> 28:27.328
They suspect something.
I know it.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.866
Well, you'd better hope
that it stays a suspicion.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.583
Let's go!

28:40.385 --> 28:42.968
Better get the Swede back.

28:43.096 --> 28:45.383
Tell him to bring more
than chloroform this time.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.967
Gentlemen,
you have made yourself

28:50.103 --> 28:53.312
a very wide variety
of very powerful enemies

28:53.440 --> 28:55.272
in a very short period of time.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.983
Now, I can offer you
no public support,

28:58.111 --> 28:59.943
but a quick resolution
to this sordid affair

29:00.072 --> 29:01.608
is in everyone's best interest.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.572
Therefore,
if you should find yourself

29:03.700 --> 29:06.363
in need of any resources in
your quest to find this man...

29:06.495 --> 29:10.114
Thank you, Mr. Morgan,
but there would be no advantage

29:10.249 --> 29:13.413
to our investigation to have
your financial involvement,

29:13.543 --> 29:16.456
especially if it were ever
to be made public.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.340
I see.
Hm.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.635
Mm-hmm.

29:30.394 --> 29:32.852
You gentlemen have yourselves
a good day.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.181
Why would you turn down his
offer if he wants to help you?

29:36.316 --> 29:38.683
Men such as J.P. Morgan
are only capable of doing

29:38.819 --> 29:41.311
what they perceive to be
in their best interest.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.216
You don't take something
from people like that

29:43.240 --> 29:45.448
without them expecting something
in return.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.988
But what could a man
like J.P. Morgan want from you?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.120
I don't know.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.787
But I'm most unwilling
to find out.

30:48.555 --> 30:51.172
Help me.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.679
I'm not crazy. Help me.

30:56.688 --> 30:57.769
Miss!

31:11.119 --> 31:13.156
Help me!

31:31.765 --> 31:35.884
You're Miss Howard from
Commissioner Roosevelt's office?

31:36.019 --> 31:37.305
Yes.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.717
You wrote a letter
some time back

31:38.814 --> 31:42.478
making inquires about patients,
I believe.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.145
Yes.

31:44.277 --> 31:49.147
And we have no one here who fit
the parameters of your search.

31:49.282 --> 31:50.944
At the time, no.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.796
However, upon looking
through correspondence

31:52.869 --> 31:54.847
from another hospital, it
appears there's a patient here

31:54.871 --> 31:57.329
who matches certain
other reference points.

32:06.216 --> 32:08.208
St. Elizabeth's.

32:09.302 --> 32:11.635
Rudolf Bunzl.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.847
Mr. Bunzl was released
six years ago.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.353
May I see his records?

32:21.982 --> 32:25.475
Blackwell's male patients have
been moved to another facility

32:25.610 --> 32:28.603
and all records along with them.

32:28.738 --> 32:33.654
I'm afraid I couldn't say where
Mr. Bunzl's file is right now.

32:36.746 --> 32:41.616
You could ask St. Elizabeth's
for their records.

32:51.178 --> 32:52.339
Excuse me.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.427
Can I ask why St. Elizabeth's
receives patients

32:57.559 --> 32:59.676
from the Western states
and territories?

33:02.189 --> 33:05.899
You work directly
for Commissioner Roosevelt?

33:06.026 --> 33:07.483
I do.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.651
Because it's
a government hospital.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.983
Pardon me?

33:15.535 --> 33:17.902
St. Elizabeth's...
Its official name

33:18.038 --> 33:19.950
is the Government Hospital
for the Insane,

33:20.081 --> 33:22.619
but it's referred to
as St. Elizabeth's

33:22.751 --> 33:26.335
out of courtesy
for its patients.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.375
And who are its patients?

33:29.341 --> 33:31.833
Soldiers and sailors
deemed unfit for service

33:31.968 --> 33:33.630
due to mental problems.

33:33.762 --> 33:35.173
Soldiers?

33:35.722 --> 33:36.722
Yes.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.844
Sent from out West?

33:41.144 --> 33:42.476
Some.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.392
Thank you.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.219
Mary?

34:34.406 --> 34:36.272
I've been thinking
of the circumstances

34:36.408 --> 34:40.947
in which you live...
that is, in which <i>we</i> live.

34:43.540 --> 34:47.409
I have no doubt that what
happened early in your life

34:47.543 --> 34:50.286
was the result of events
that provoked

34:50.422 --> 34:53.880
an aberrant outburst of violence
on your part.

34:55.885 --> 34:59.754
However, I believe
that is behind you.

35:04.894 --> 35:08.137
So I wonder if it might be
best for you...

35:10.275 --> 35:12.437
...to strike out on your own.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.151
You're a woman now...

35:22.412 --> 35:25.450
...and capable of living
by yourself.

36:06.289 --> 36:08.076
Sara.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.325
He's a soldier.

36:10.460 --> 36:11.701
What?

36:11.836 --> 36:14.328
I think he may have been
a soldier.

36:14.464 --> 36:17.753
I went to Blackwell's Island
today.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.501
That must have been difficult.
Are you all right?

36:20.637 --> 36:22.845
Yes.
Thank you.

36:24.224 --> 36:26.466
I went there
to ask after a patient,

36:26.601 --> 36:29.560
a man with a history of violence
toward children.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.226
He was once committed to
a mental hospital in Washington,

36:32.357 --> 36:33.438
sent there from out West.

36:33.566 --> 36:34.898
I don't see the connection.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.733
St. Elizabeth's
is the Government Hospital

36:36.861 --> 36:38.022
for the Insane.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.754
It's where they send soldiers
and sailors

36:39.781 --> 36:41.238
deemed unfit for duty.

36:41.366 --> 36:42.573
What did you find out?

36:42.701 --> 36:46.035
He was released from Blackwell
six years ago.

36:46.162 --> 36:48.265
I rang St. Elizabeth's and asked
them to tell me more about him,

36:48.289 --> 36:50.747
but they wouldn't provide any
information over the telephone.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.411
I propose that I go there
in person.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.627
- Have you told Kreizler?
- You'll have to tell him.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.086
Come on, then.
We'll go together.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.214
No.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.633
Sara, what's wrong?

37:02.804 --> 37:05.046
Has something happened
between you?

37:05.890 --> 37:08.223
He was right about one thing.

37:09.310 --> 37:13.054
Given certain circumstances,
we're all capable of violence.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.896
Did he hurt you?

37:54.355 --> 37:55.846
Ezra?

37:57.525 --> 37:59.437
Ezra!

38:00.236 --> 38:02.228
Where did you get this?

38:08.453 --> 38:10.115
A knife is not a toy.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.670
Just couldn't sleep?

38:25.261 --> 38:26.422
Come on.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.069
He likes you.

38:47.242 --> 38:49.234
Let's put him to bed.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.500
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?

39:00.338 --> 39:01.419
John.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.164
John, this is Ezra.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.334
Hello, Ezra.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.587
Think you can sleep now?

39:10.849 --> 39:13.933
Well, then good night.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.810
What's the matter, John?

39:20.942 --> 39:23.309
You seem disquieted
by something.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.361
What did you do to her?

39:28.283 --> 39:30.400
- To whom?
- Sara.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.615
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.322
What happened?

39:36.457 --> 39:40.201
That's why you've come...
to ask me about Sara?

39:40.336 --> 39:42.578
I've come to tell you
it's possible our killer

39:42.714 --> 39:44.376
was once a solider out West.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.591
How did you arrive at this?

39:47.719 --> 39:49.255
Sara.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.757
She intends to go to Washington
to continue investigating.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.601
It would only draw attention
to Roosevelt.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.561
We'll make the trip ourselves.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.851
Tell me what happened
between you.

40:01.983 --> 40:04.475
Sara felt entitled to bring up
certain things...

40:04.611 --> 40:07.979
personal things that I would
rather not discuss with you.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.606
May I remind you it was I
that introduced you?

40:10.742 --> 40:14.201
Yes... our handsome but indolent
mutual friend.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.661
Is that what you think of me?

40:16.789 --> 40:18.325
No.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.745
It's what Sara thinks of you.

40:24.839 --> 40:26.580
I'm sorry to say it, John,

40:26.716 --> 40:29.584
but I'm afraid that's all
she'll ever think of you.

40:30.887 --> 40:34.551
She's far too kind to say it, so
it's best you hear it from me.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.555
Be careful, Laszlo...

40:38.686 --> 40:41.770
or you're going to end up
a lonely old man.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.329
Come on! Knock him out!

41:10.718 --> 41:12.926
Twenty on Eat 'Em Up Jack.

41:14.055 --> 41:14.889
Okay.

41:14.890 --> 41:16.130
Come on, Jack!

41:17.308 --> 41:18.469
Eat 'em up!

41:22.855 --> 41:25.347
Yo ho!

41:53.678 --> 41:55.590
Yeah!

42:17.368 --> 42:19.234
You lost, society boy?

42:19.370 --> 42:22.033
Wandered out
of your own neighborhood?

42:22.957 --> 42:24.789
Then again...

42:25.960 --> 42:28.452
...you seem to like it
down here...

42:30.798 --> 42:34.132
...with all the fairies
and the sodomites.

42:34.260 --> 42:38.220
Must be a fairy yourself, huh?

42:42.477 --> 42:44.139
Am I right?

42:45.229 --> 42:46.640
Look at me.

42:48.858 --> 42:49.974
Look at me!

42:57.533 --> 43:00.992
You're in well over your head,
you and that alienist.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.746
Do you hear me?

43:10.088 --> 43:13.126
You don't scare me, Connor.

43:54.882 --> 43:56.214
Mary...

44:00.054 --> 44:03.638
...after all that's happened
in the past 24 hours, I...

44:12.817 --> 44:15.309
If it's not a presumption, I...

44:16.154 --> 44:19.318
...I'd very much like
if you would join me for dinner.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.688
Please sit closer.

45:15.755 --> 45:18.042
I don't know why I didn't ask
before.

45:35.399 --> 45:39.143
This is "O Patria Mia" from...
from Verdi's "Aida."

45:41.322 --> 45:43.609
Of course you know that.
