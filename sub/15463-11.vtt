HIDE-AND-GO-SEEK
WITH ME.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.336
THAT'S ALL.

18:50.921 --> 18:53.715
HEY, WHERE'S THE BABY-SITTER?

18:53.799 --> 18:56.009
{\an1}HELLO, MR. DRAWN TOGETHER.
THE OTHERS ARE IN BED,

18:56.093 --> 18:58.136
BUT THESE 4 ARE
SO WELL-BEHAVED,

18:58.220 --> 18:59.638
I LET THEM STAY UP TO PLAY.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.098
{\an1}LISTEN, HONEY, I'LL GO AHEAD
AND TAKE THE SITTER HOME.

19:01.181 --> 19:05.394
OH, GOOD. I'VE BEEN
BREWING A MAJOR STEAMER,

19:05.477 --> 19:06.061
AND IF I DON'T
DROP IT OUT SOON,

19:06.144 --> 19:08.814
{\an1}IT'S GONNA TEAR ME
TO SHREDS.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.983
{\an1}WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE SO DISGUSTING?!

19:11.066 --> 19:14.486
{\an1}SO, CHARLOTTE,
YOU TOLD YOUR PARENTS

19:14.570 --> 19:17.656
{\an1}YOU WOULDN'T BE HOME
FOR ANOTHER HOUR, RIGHT?

19:17.739 --> 19:19.908
UH, RIGHT. OF COURSE.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.704
{\an1}WELL, I FORGOT
TO GIVE YA A TIP.

19:24.621 --> 19:28.834
{\an1}[CRYING]

19:28.917 --> 19:32.004
{\an1}I GUESS THIS IS
WHAT WE GET FOR LYING.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.839
{\an1}THANKS FOR COVERING,
HERO.

19:33.922 --> 19:36.758
{\an1}I GUESS YOU LEARNED NOBODY
LIKES A TATTLETALE.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.719
YEAH, RIGHT.
WHATEVER.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.888
LISTEN, I'M GONNA
BE A WHILE.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.599
YOU GUYS RUN ALONG.

19:43.682 --> 19:48.145
I'M GONNA SPEND SOME
TIME WITH MY NEW FRIEND.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.106
{\an1}AND THAT IS HOW
CAPTAIN HERO LEARNED

19:51.189 --> 19:55.152
{\an1}THAT DEAD BODIES
ARE GAME FOR ANYTHING.

19:55.235 --> 19:59.948
AND I DO MEAN <i> ANYTHING.</i>

20:00.032 --> 20:00.699
GOOD NIGHT.

20:00.782 --> 20:04.328
{\an1}AND...YOU.
