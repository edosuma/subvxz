00:01.761 --> 00:03.807
Previously onCharmed...MEL: Tell the Elders

00:03.850 --> 00:06.549
I will do anything
to save her. Anything.

00:06.592 --> 00:07.593
It's a powerful history

00:07.637 --> 00:08.942
rewriting spell.

00:08.986 --> 00:11.075
MEL: To make it
as if Niko and I never met.

00:11.119 --> 00:12.120
HARRY: There will be
ripple effects and other

00:12.163 --> 00:13.512
unintended consequences

00:13.556 --> 00:15.079
that simply cannot be foreseen.

00:15.123 --> 00:15.993
Oh, my God.

00:16.037 --> 00:17.516
I never got this job.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.083
Nice to meet you,
Maggie. I'm Summer.

00:19.127 --> 00:21.216
Look, I should
probably explain...How you got together

00:21.259 --> 00:22.869
with someone else, like,
a minute after we kissed?

00:22.913 --> 00:24.654
You mean after you blew me off
several times.

00:24.697 --> 00:25.872
I got the message,
and I moved on.

00:25.916 --> 00:27.396
Got the right message, didn't I?

00:27.439 --> 00:29.224
HARRY: A mark like that
cannot be dismissed.

00:29.267 --> 00:30.616
We need to know
exactly what it looked like.

00:30.660 --> 00:32.140
I need you to do
a social media deep dive

00:32.183 --> 00:34.316
and find out
who Parker cheated with.

00:34.359 --> 00:36.274
Ta-da. Found her.

00:36.318 --> 00:38.972
You are finished
at Kappa.

00:39.016 --> 00:40.539
I never want
to see your face

00:40.583 --> 00:41.540
again.

00:43.629 --> 00:45.762
MAGGIE:
Wakey, wakey.

00:45.805 --> 00:48.069
Hi, sunshine.

00:48.112 --> 00:49.635
You've been asleep
all day.

00:49.679 --> 00:51.550
The light.Good thing

00:51.594 --> 00:53.204
we're witches, not vampires.

00:53.248 --> 00:55.032
I was being constructive,
I swear.

00:55.076 --> 00:56.512
I was researching
something,

00:56.555 --> 00:59.167
and I passed out.Okay, we know
you're still hurting

00:59.210 --> 01:01.952
over Niko...But you can't stay moping
in bed forever.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.475
It's time to shower,

01:03.519 --> 01:05.129
put on something
other than yoga pants...

01:05.173 --> 01:07.044
And face the world.

01:07.088 --> 01:08.263
I wasn't moping.

01:08.306 --> 01:10.134
I was keeping busy.

01:10.178 --> 01:12.180
Look, the pattern
that was found on Mom

01:12.223 --> 01:14.182
and the other Elders
that were killed is something

01:14.225 --> 01:15.748
called a Lichtenberg figure.

01:15.792 --> 01:17.272
Yeah, I've
heard of them.

01:17.315 --> 01:20.840
They're associated
with high-voltage electricity.Exactly.

01:20.884 --> 01:22.277
And they're found
on people or places

01:22.320 --> 01:24.148
that have been struck
by lightning.

01:24.192 --> 01:26.629
So Mom was killed
by some sort of...

01:26.672 --> 01:28.152
lightning demon?

01:28.196 --> 01:29.936
MEL:
Seems like it.

01:29.980 --> 01:31.938
But, so far,
I've found 893 demons

01:31.982 --> 01:34.115
associated with lightning
and electricity.

01:34.158 --> 01:36.639
Why is it always hundreds
and never, like, five?

01:36.682 --> 01:37.727
Trust me,

01:37.770 --> 01:39.337
I'll find it.

01:39.381 --> 01:40.991
Okay, that's enough.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.471
You need to get
some fresh air.

01:42.514 --> 01:44.255
It smells
like old gym socks in here.

01:44.299 --> 01:45.343
Yeah, look,
you're not gonna crack

01:45.387 --> 01:48.346
this clue tonight.
So, I'm suggesting

01:48.390 --> 01:50.174
Mojito Night at the Haunt?

01:50.218 --> 01:51.523
Yes. Yes!

01:51.567 --> 01:52.524
Come on.
The Haunt.

01:52.568 --> 01:53.699
No excuses.

01:53.743 --> 01:54.700
You love the Haunt.

01:54.744 --> 01:56.354
You love the Haunt.

01:58.008 --> 01:59.749
♪ Work, work, harder, harder

01:59.792 --> 02:01.838
♪ We work, work
for the dollar, dollar ♪

02:01.881 --> 02:03.622
Cheers, bitches.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.189
What did you call us?

02:05.233 --> 02:07.191
Mm. :
It's code.

02:07.235 --> 02:08.497
You know,
pretend I'm saying

02:08.540 --> 02:11.064
the W-word instead.You know,

02:11.108 --> 02:14.416
I really am starting
to warm to your inane chatter.

02:14.459 --> 02:16.940
I may actually miss it
once the Elders determine

02:16.983 --> 02:18.420
it's time for me to move out.

02:18.463 --> 02:20.161
MEL: And when is
that, exactly?

02:20.204 --> 02:21.858
We do have The Book of Shadows
back.

02:21.901 --> 02:23.338
Well, I'm sure
their decision is imminent.

02:24.904 --> 02:27.037
Congratulations.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.604
To getting Mel out of the house.

02:28.647 --> 02:30.432
Yesh.

02:30.475 --> 02:32.434
Oh. Your shirt
is on inside out.

02:32.477 --> 02:33.739
I showered.

02:33.783 --> 02:35.654
That was your only requirement.

02:37.700 --> 02:40.442
Doesn't it feel so good
to be out, guys?

02:40.485 --> 02:41.530
I've practically
been an agoraphobe

02:41.573 --> 02:43.358
since Lucy kicked
me out of Kappa.

02:43.401 --> 02:45.447
You okay?Now my Insta's
full of...

02:45.490 --> 02:48.667
happy pledges, all excited
for Initiation Week.

02:48.711 --> 02:51.322
I would have been a full-fledged
Kappa sister tomorrow.

02:51.366 --> 02:53.585
You'll find
another group to join.

02:54.978 --> 02:56.284
Greek life is toxic anyway.

02:56.327 --> 02:57.894
MACY: Well, I'm glad
we're out, too.

02:57.937 --> 03:00.375
I can't stop thinking
about that mark on Galvin,

03:00.418 --> 03:02.638
and I haven't been able to find
it in The Book of Shadows.

03:02.681 --> 03:06.294
Galvin's seemingly
normal outward appearance

03:06.337 --> 03:08.165
doesn't preclude him
from danger.

03:08.209 --> 03:10.080
I've done some research.

03:10.123 --> 03:13.475
There are several
recently recorded instances

03:13.518 --> 03:15.390
of mortals being marked
by demons

03:15.433 --> 03:17.348
as part of--
one assumes--

03:17.392 --> 03:19.829
a larger plan.

03:19.872 --> 03:22.353
A demon could be using Galvin
to get to the three of you.

03:22.397 --> 03:24.355
You must remain
on your guard.

03:24.399 --> 03:25.748
Mm-hmm.

03:25.791 --> 03:26.749
Here you go.Thank you.
Oh.

03:26.792 --> 03:28.098
Thank you.So kind.

03:29.708 --> 03:31.580
Can anyone spot me?

03:31.623 --> 03:33.756
No job means no check.

03:33.799 --> 03:35.410
Oh, on that subject,

03:35.453 --> 03:37.847
there's an opening
in the administrative department

03:37.890 --> 03:39.283
at the university.

03:39.327 --> 03:40.850
I pulled some strings
and got you an interview

03:40.893 --> 03:41.851
tomorrow afternoon.

03:41.894 --> 03:43.156
Hey, that's great.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.245
The administrative department?

03:44.288 --> 03:45.289
It is a paycheck.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.595
And it gets you out
of the house.

03:46.638 --> 03:47.987
Fine.

03:48.031 --> 03:49.075
Whatever.

03:49.119 --> 03:51.034
It's just an interview.

03:51.077 --> 03:52.122
Good.WOMAN: Hi, Lucy!

03:52.165 --> 03:53.993
LUCY :
Yes!

03:54.037 --> 03:55.908
Oh, my gosh. Hey, Ben.Hey. What's up?

03:55.952 --> 03:57.301
LUCY :
How's it going?

03:57.345 --> 04:00.086
WOMAN 2: Hey, girl.LUCY: My ladies.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.098
MACY:
Should we...

04:12.142 --> 04:14.971
finish our drinks
and go home?No.

04:15.014 --> 04:17.365
Maybe this is my chance
to clear the air.

04:17.408 --> 04:18.801
I'll bring over a pitcher
of skinny mojitos

04:18.844 --> 04:20.542
as a peace offering.

04:26.765 --> 04:28.071
Hi.

04:29.899 --> 04:32.075
Um...

04:32.118 --> 04:33.337
I know I'm probably, like,

04:33.381 --> 04:35.644
the last person you want
to see right now.

04:35.687 --> 04:37.210
But I just
want to say,

04:37.254 --> 04:39.169
again,

04:39.212 --> 04:41.127
I'm sorry.

04:41.171 --> 04:42.825
I really screwed up.

04:44.609 --> 04:46.002
I can't change
what happened,

04:46.045 --> 04:49.179
but at least you can
have a round on me.

04:49.222 --> 04:51.529
You know, that is
just what I need.

04:51.573 --> 04:54.227
Mm. A round on you.

05:01.278 --> 05:02.323
Don't.

05:02.366 --> 05:03.933
Let her do it.

05:03.976 --> 05:06.370
If she lets it all out,
maybe she'll forgive me.

05:06.414 --> 05:07.632
Maggie.

05:07.676 --> 05:09.982
I kissed her boyfriend,
and I lied about it.

05:10.026 --> 05:13.072
I deserve to be drenched
in rum and aspartame.

05:13.116 --> 05:14.073
Nobody deserves that.

05:22.299 --> 05:24.170
I meant to do that.

05:24.214 --> 05:25.171
Those boots

05:25.215 --> 05:26.912

05:26.956 --> 05:29.350
Stay away from me, Maggie.

05:30.176 --> 05:32.091

I think something's up at Kappa.Agree.

09:42.037 --> 09:43.995
They're internalizing the
patriarchy, for starters.

09:44.039 --> 09:45.475
I'm serious.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.651

09:47.695 --> 09:50.088
Why would you do that,
after what she did to you?

09:50.132 --> 09:51.655
You're missing the point.

09:51.699 --> 09:54.136
There was a new sister.

09:54.179 --> 09:55.354
Brenda.

09:55.398 --> 09:56.704
I've never seen her before

09:57.748 --> 09:59.271
That doesn't mean anything.

09:59.315 --> 10:01.230
Remember Summer the Succubus?

10:01.273 --> 10:04.668
You thought she was a demon when
she actually was just amazing.

10:04.712 --> 10:06.322
You're just projecting.

10:06.365 --> 10:08.150
No, you don't understand.

10:08.193 --> 10:10.152
If Brenda were a real Kappa,
I would know.

10:10.195 --> 10:12.545

to memorize every Kappa's name,

10:19.640 --> 10:21.337

can't find her.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.564

and fell off the Kappa roof.

10:31.608 --> 10:33.349
February 13.

10:33.392 --> 10:35.351

10:35.394 --> 10:38.267
Well, that explains
the eye shadow.

10:38.310 --> 10:40.399
Brenda from Kappa's
a freaking ghost.

10:47.058 --> 10:49.800
A ghost. Oh, dear.Don't tell me a ghost

10:49.844 --> 10:50.888
is worse than a demon.

10:50.932 --> 10:52.107
Well, that all depends
on the type

10:52.150 --> 10:54.152
of ghost, I'm afraid.
There are...

10:54.196 --> 10:56.154
Five?Hundreds.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.156

from Casper

10:58.200 --> 10:59.723

11:01.072 --> 11:02.813
No! Oh...

11:05.816 --> 11:08.558
HARRY: Oh, dear,
it looks awful.

11:08.601 --> 11:09.864
Galvin didn't want
to invite me anyway,

11:09.907 --> 11:11.343
Summer already thinks
I'm some jealous clinger,

11:11.387 --> 11:13.302
and now I'm the weirdo
bringing the burnt pie.

11:13.345 --> 11:14.912
Maybe I
shouldn't go.

11:14.956 --> 11:16.522
Yeah, it sounds like you need
help identifying this ghost.

11:16.566 --> 11:17.741
Macy, you can't ignore
this mark.

11:17.785 --> 11:19.264
It's glowing brighter.

11:19.308 --> 11:20.831
Danger could be imminent.MEL: Don't worry.

11:20.875 --> 11:23.486
I'll help Maggie
with the ghost.And youhave

11:23.529 --> 11:24.487

11:24.530 --> 11:26.532
This is obviously
more important.

11:26.576 --> 11:27.577
I think Maggie
can handle

11:27.620 --> 11:28.752
looking up a spell in the Book.

11:28.796 --> 11:30.058
Plus, you hate Kappa.I'm not gonna

11:30.101 --> 11:32.800
let you face
a demonic ghost alone.

11:32.843 --> 11:35.150
HARRY: Fine.
Consult the Book.
It will tell you

11:35.193 --> 11:36.891
how to identify
the type of specter

11:36.934 --> 11:38.370
and then how
to vanquish it.

11:38.414 --> 11:39.545
Keep me posted.

11:39.589 --> 11:41.243
In the meantime...

11:41.286 --> 11:43.332
why don't I accompany you
to your soiree.

11:44.768 --> 11:46.030
Maggie couldn't see the mark,

11:46.074 --> 11:47.031
but perhaps I can.

11:47.075 --> 11:48.641
And Summer
won't think you're

11:48.685 --> 11:50.731
the jealous type if you arrive
with a chap on your arm.

11:52.123 --> 11:53.777
I guess that's true.

11:53.821 --> 11:56.475
I also happen to have
a delightful recipe

11:56.519 --> 11:58.608
for Welsh rarebit.

11:59.217 --> 12:00.566
Welsh rabbit?

12:00.610 --> 12:03.569
Rarebit. It's an exquisite
cheese sauce on toast.

12:03.613 --> 12:04.788
A real hit

12:04.832 --> 12:06.834
at gatherings. It's...O-Okay.

12:06.877 --> 12:08.487
Yeah, fine.
I-I guess you can come.

12:08.531 --> 12:09.837
Splendid.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.403
Have fun, you two.

12:12.709 --> 12:13.754
Mmm.

12:13.797 --> 12:17.670
How do we identify a ghost?

12:21.674 --> 12:23.415
"Call to a restless spirit."

12:23.459 --> 12:24.808
Okay, so to determine
what type of ghost,

12:24.852 --> 12:26.418
we need to know
what she wants,

12:26.462 --> 12:28.159
why she's haunting.

12:28.203 --> 12:30.205
We need to recreate the moment
that the ghost can't

move on from
with this spell.

Brenda Mancini

14:52.390 --> 14:55.176

It's Mom.

15:14.412 --> 15:16.501
Wait, but what about Brenda?

15:16.545 --> 15:18.503
We already know what
they did to her.

15:18.547 --> 15:20.157
This is Mom.

15:21.985 --> 15:24.945
You were just with the doctor?
What did he say?

15:24.988 --> 15:27.164
The doctor says
everything's fine.

Marisol, you can't
keep obsessing like this.

15:44.573 --> 15:46.096

No, this is
more than that.

15:52.233 --> 15:54.975

wrong with the baby.

15:57.803 --> 15:59.980
Really wrong.

16:15.647 --> 16:18.041
Why did it end?
I wanted to see more.

16:18.085 --> 16:19.825
Me too.

16:19.869 --> 16:21.827
She was so young.

16:25.092 --> 16:26.702

16:26.745 --> 16:29.574
Well, obviously Macy
came out fine.

16:31.098 --> 16:33.317
And I think we know
what kind of ghost Brenda is.

16:33.361 --> 16:35.841
She must be a banshee.
She died in pain,

16:35.885 --> 16:38.192
and now she's spreading
sorrow and misery.

16:38.235 --> 16:40.063
Do we really have
to get rid of her?

16:40.107 --> 16:43.197

a little sorrow and misery.

20:06.704 --> 20:10.447
I should get course credit
for being a witch.

20:10.491 --> 20:11.796
It's not working.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.450
Are you sure about this?

20:13.494 --> 20:15.626
Yes. I saw Niko do it once.

20:28.465 --> 20:30.815
Where are they?

20:54.535 --> 20:56.493
That crazy bitch
left with Lucy.

20:56.537 --> 20:58.495
Was it the crazy bitch with
the janky two

20:58.539 --> 21:00.671
Brenda?Yes.

21:00.715 --> 21:03.370
I think I peed my skinnies.

21:03.413 --> 21:05.328
This is weird.

21:05.372 --> 21:07.591
These girls aren't
under Brenda's spell.

21:07.635 --> 21:09.680
But Lucy was.
She thought Brenda was a sister.

21:09.724 --> 21:12.074
So she's not haunting everyone.

21:12.117 --> 21:13.554
Just Lucy.

21:15.295 --> 21:16.861
Any idea on where they went?

21:16.905 --> 21:18.298
Uh, I don't know.

21:18.341 --> 21:20.517
Uh, th-that Brenda girl

21:20.561 --> 21:23.215
was talking about some,
um, treacherous friend

21:23.259 --> 21:25.305
and how it was unfair.

21:26.349 --> 21:27.611
A treacherous friend.

21:27.655 --> 21:29.787
She must mean...Jenna,

21:29.831 --> 21:32.050
the mean girl from the
quad who betrayed her.

21:32.094 --> 21:33.704
Brenda wants revenge.

21:33.748 --> 21:35.140
And because
she doesn't have a body,

21:35.184 --> 21:36.664
she needs Lucy
to do her bidding.

21:36.707 --> 21:38.230
Jenna's in danger.

21:38.274 --> 21:39.275
Oh, God.

21:39.319 --> 21:40.450
We have to find her.

21:41.582 --> 21:43.453
Um, keep them frozen.

21:43.497 --> 21:44.672
I have an idea.

22:05.432 --> 22:07.477
I found her. Harry!

22:08.826 --> 22:10.828
We have to save a middle-aged
sorority sister.

22:10.872 --> 22:12.134
I'm sorry... what?

22:12.177 --> 22:13.701
No time to explain.

22:13.744 --> 22:16.399
Her name is Jenna Gordonson
and she's in danger.

22:16.443 --> 22:18.662
Can you access the alumni
database and find her address?

22:18.706 --> 22:19.620
Well, yes, but I...

22:19.663 --> 22:21.622
And wipe their
memories. Hurry!

22:21.665 --> 22:22.753
Good God,

22:22.797 --> 22:24.189
a Whitelighter's work
is never done.

22:31.936 --> 22:35.287
MACY:
"The cowrie shell shields
the bearer."

22:35.331 --> 22:36.332
Hmm.

22:36.376 --> 22:37.420
Sorry about that,
your sisters

22:37.464 --> 22:39.379
are on the trail of a banshee.

22:39.422 --> 22:41.468
Are they okay?Thus far.

22:41.511 --> 22:43.426
Now, were were we?

22:43.470 --> 22:45.428
I think Galvin's mark
is a cowrie shell.

22:45.472 --> 22:46.864
The Booksays
in Yoruba tradition

22:46.908 --> 22:48.170
it's placed upon infants
to give them

22:48.213 --> 22:50.085
lifelong protection
from magical beings.

22:50.128 --> 22:51.129
Good news, then.

22:51.173 --> 22:53.262
This mark is not
of demonic origin.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.830
It still doesn't explain why I'm
the only one who can see it.

22:55.873 --> 22:58.528
Well, is it possible you're
the one who activated it,

22:58.572 --> 23:00.748
with that kiss on Halloween?

23:00.791 --> 23:02.402
It would explain
why you and Galvin

23:02.445 --> 23:03.968
were driven apart
in the time since.

23:04.012 --> 23:07.494
I don't know if I can
blame that on the mark.

23:07.537 --> 23:09.844
I pretty much drove him away.

23:09.887 --> 23:13.804
I've been pretty unapproachable
as long as I've known him.

23:13.848 --> 23:16.633
Don't say that
about yourself, Macy.

23:16.677 --> 23:18.505
You're not like
that at all.

23:21.638 --> 23:24.511
Thanks, Harry.

23:24.554 --> 23:26.687
Thanks for coming
to Galvin's party with me.

23:26.730 --> 23:28.471
My pleasure.

23:28.515 --> 23:30.125
You're a good friend.

23:30.168 --> 23:33.345
Well, thank you.

23:33.389 --> 23:37.001
I enjoy you and your
sisters' company, too.

23:38.525 --> 23:42.746
In truth, the Elders
decided days ago

23:42.790 --> 23:44.966
you three no longer need
added protection,

23:45.009 --> 23:47.621
now the Bookhas been returned,
but I-I must confess,

23:47.664 --> 23:49.884
I've been rather
reluctant to leave.

23:49.927 --> 23:52.452
As exotic and thrilling
as my life may seem,

23:52.495 --> 23:55.672
it can be isolating.

23:55.716 --> 23:58.414
Being here has
been a nice change.

23:59.981 --> 24:01.896
I suppose what I'm
trying to say

24:01.939 --> 24:03.941
is I consider you three...

24:05.900 --> 24:07.554
friends, as well.

24:07.597 --> 24:11.514
Harry, that is so sweet.

24:11.558 --> 24:14.386
Good.

24:17.477 --> 24:19.391
Hey, you know
what Galvin told me?

24:19.435 --> 24:21.219
He has family from Haiti.

24:21.263 --> 24:23.265
I'm pretty sure forms

24:23.308 --> 24:25.354
of the Yoruba religion
are practiced there.

24:34.624 --> 24:36.974
Bingo. A priestess.

24:37.018 --> 24:40.935
Haitian Yoruba practitioner
not far from here.

24:40.978 --> 24:42.893
Four stars on
Yelp, no less.

24:42.937 --> 24:44.155
Let's go.

24:44.199 --> 24:46.114
Maybe she can tell me

24:46.157 --> 24:47.550
why I'm the only one
who can see this mark.

24:47.594 --> 24:49.552
Dr. Vaughn,
the scientist,

24:49.596 --> 24:52.990
wishes to seek counsel
from a priestess?

24:53.034 --> 24:55.427
Well, Harry,
this is a scientist

24:55.471 --> 24:57.038
who got dressed
with her mind this morning.

24:57.081 --> 24:58.822
Fair point.

24:58.866 --> 25:01.608
WOMAN: You're reporters from BuzzFeed?

25:01.651 --> 25:03.566
Yeah. We're, uh,
intrepid reporters.Ah.

25:03.610 --> 25:06.395
And you're Jenna Gordonson,
Kappa alum, correct?

25:06.438 --> 25:08.484
Yes.

25:08.528 --> 25:11.835
I was president
in the late '80s.

25:11.879 --> 25:14.838
And you're safe,
so that's good.

25:14.882 --> 25:17.580
What is it you ladies
wanted to ask me?

25:17.624 --> 25:19.495
Oh, we are doing an article:

25:19.539 --> 25:21.279
ten spookiest deaths
in the Greek system,

25:21.323 --> 25:23.543
and we wanted to ask you
about one of them.

25:23.586 --> 25:25.893
Why, has there been
another death at Kappa?

25:25.936 --> 25:27.895
Anotherdeath at Kappa?

25:28.896 --> 25:30.375
What do you mean?

25:34.423 --> 25:36.425
Brenda's death
really shook me.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.906
As Kappa president,
I tried to cut down

25:38.949 --> 25:41.256
on the drinking on Greek Row.

25:41.299 --> 25:43.867
But that wasn't
very popular, so...

25:43.911 --> 25:46.261
girls kept dying
in the same way.

25:46.304 --> 25:50.047
Getting drunk,
climbing up on the roof...

25:50.091 --> 25:52.136
and falling to their deaths.

25:52.180 --> 25:54.095
Why is this this first I'm
hearing of these accidents?

25:54.138 --> 25:55.531
Because the alumni board
covers it up.

25:55.575 --> 25:57.707
But it's in the papers.

25:57.751 --> 25:58.839
JENNA:
Sure, it's in the papers,

25:58.882 --> 26:00.580
but you won't find
any link to Kappa.

26:00.623 --> 26:02.973
And Brenda was the first
of these deaths?

26:03.017 --> 26:04.584
What exactly
happened with her?

26:04.627 --> 26:07.935
We know she was bullied and
kicked out of pledge class.

26:07.978 --> 26:09.066
Bullied?

26:09.110 --> 26:12.809
Brenda was the bully.

26:12.853 --> 26:14.637
We don't bully at Kappa.

26:14.681 --> 26:16.596
Exactly.

26:16.639 --> 26:17.988
See? This is what
I've been telling you.

26:18.032 --> 26:19.860
I don't get it.

26:19.903 --> 26:22.427
You were her friend
and you kicked her out.

26:22.471 --> 26:23.472
JENNA:
You would have kicked
her out, too,

26:23.515 --> 26:25.735
if you knew what
she was really like.

26:25.779 --> 26:29.609
Cruel. Manipulative.
No loyalty.

26:29.652 --> 26:32.612
She slept with Heather M.
and Heather B.'s boyfriends.

26:32.655 --> 26:34.309
The night after
we cut her,

26:34.352 --> 26:36.964
she broke into Kappa,

26:37.007 --> 26:39.183
stole her initiation candle--
God knows why--

26:39.227 --> 26:43.579
then climbed up onto the roof to
hang a banner saying all kinds

26:43.623 --> 26:46.669
of nasty stuff about us.

26:46.713 --> 26:50.020
But she was drunk
on wine coolers...

26:50.064 --> 26:52.501
and she fell.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.635
We got this all wrong.

26:55.678 --> 26:57.637
Brenda died in anger.
She's a revenant.

26:57.680 --> 27:00.291
And she's been killing sisters
the same way she died.

27:00.335 --> 27:02.076
Oh, my God.

27:02.119 --> 27:04.165
Brenda's gonna kill Lucy.

27:07.255 --> 27:10.171
Can't we go back
to the store

27:10.214 --> 27:12.129
for something less
cough

27:12.173 --> 27:14.088
Shut up and chug, loser.

27:14.131 --> 27:16.133
Okay.

27:30.495 --> 27:32.802
MACY:
Nails, too.

27:32.846 --> 27:36.414
Well, this priestess
certainly knows how to hustle.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.590
We all have day jobs, Macy,

27:38.634 --> 27:40.244
and they come in various forms.

27:40.288 --> 27:43.987
Consider me, a learned
Women's Studies professor wi...

27:45.423 --> 27:46.468
Harry?

27:46.511 --> 27:48.252
Your sisters
are calling me again.

27:48.296 --> 27:49.819
Can you proceed solo?

27:49.863 --> 27:51.429
Of course.

27:57.871 --> 27:58.959
MAMA ROZ:
So...

27:59.002 --> 28:00.743
my dear,

28:00.787 --> 28:03.224
you seek the light
of knowledge?

28:05.487 --> 28:08.838
You've come to
the right place.

28:08.882 --> 28:11.754
It's $20 for ten minutes.

28:11.798 --> 28:14.235
This is a rare chance

28:14.278 --> 28:17.542
to hear from someone
who has the sight.

28:17.586 --> 28:18.805
The ability to hear

28:18.848 --> 28:21.764
precisely what you need to know.

28:21.808 --> 28:23.940
Trust Mama Roz.

28:23.984 --> 28:26.029
I have the gift.

28:26.073 --> 28:28.249
And bills to pay,
so, if you don't mind.

28:28.292 --> 28:30.077
Mm.

28:33.167 --> 28:37.954
So I just need to know
more about this symbol.

28:42.742 --> 28:45.701
Where did you see this mark?

28:45.745 --> 28:47.268
On a friend.

28:47.311 --> 28:49.139
And yousaw it?

28:49.183 --> 28:50.924
Yes.

28:50.967 --> 28:52.621
I think it's
some kind of

28:52.664 --> 28:54.797
protection ward, right?

28:56.930 --> 28:58.453
Yes.

28:59.933 --> 29:01.848
Fates step in
if the wearer of the mark

29:01.891 --> 29:03.371
gets too close.

29:03.414 --> 29:06.853
Close, mOh, no.

29:06.896 --> 29:09.899
Stay away from him...
or her.

29:10.857 --> 29:12.249
They're not for you.

29:12.293 --> 29:13.816
Why?

29:13.860 --> 29:17.428
Because...

29:17.472 --> 29:19.953
you've got the Ibi in you.

29:19.996 --> 29:21.955
What does the Ibi mean?

29:21.998 --> 29:24.740
I believe your time is up.

29:27.308 --> 29:28.831
Tell me.

29:35.533 --> 29:37.318
It means darkness.

29:37.361 --> 29:41.235
You've got darkness
inside you.

29:41.278 --> 29:42.671
Since you were born.

29:42.714 --> 29:44.847
:
Forget it.

29:44.891 --> 29:46.022
I don't know what I
was thinking consulting

29:46.066 --> 29:47.850
a psychic for answers.

29:47.894 --> 29:50.592
You're different from
your sisters, child.

29:52.681 --> 29:54.857
Search within.

29:54.901 --> 29:57.773
Don't you feel it?

30:00.820 --> 30:03.823
The pillar of your path holds
the key to your darkness.

30:14.572 --> 30:18.446
Maybe we should
go back down, Brenda.

30:18.489 --> 30:20.883
We're not supposed
to be up here.

30:20.927 --> 30:22.667
Stop being such
a buzzkill.

30:22.711 --> 30:24.887
The fun is just
getting started.

30:24.931 --> 30:28.891
But I'm afraid of heights.

30:28.935 --> 30:30.153
Oh, don't worry.

30:30.197 --> 30:31.894
You won't be here long.

30:31.938 --> 30:34.375
'Cause you're gonna jump.

30:34.418 --> 30:36.116
What?

30:36.159 --> 30:38.248
After this wine cooler

30:38.292 --> 30:39.902
you will be
just drunk enough.

30:39.946 --> 30:41.730
You're gonna jump, Lucy.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.079
You are gonna die,

30:43.123 --> 30:46.778
just like I did.

30:46.822 --> 30:50.521
Brenda... I can't.

30:50.565 --> 30:52.393
You can and you will.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.833
Oh, for the love of God,

30:57.877 --> 30:59.574
that really takes it out of me.

30:59.617 --> 31:01.706
Sorry, Harry, but this
is a real Kappamergency.

31:01.750 --> 31:03.621
Guys!

31:03.665 --> 31:04.927
Lucy, stop!

31:04.971 --> 31:06.537
Mel, start the
Revenant Vanquishing spell.

31:06.581 --> 31:08.148
Okay. Okay.

31:08.191 --> 31:09.497
Audi nos, refer

31:09.540 --> 31:10.890
te unde subivieris.

31:15.111 --> 31:17.853
Sorry. Yeah, still here.

31:17.897 --> 31:19.463
Bummer-rama for you.

31:19.507 --> 31:21.074
Oh, my God,
why didn't it work?

31:21.117 --> 31:23.511
LUCY:
Leave me alone!

31:23.554 --> 31:25.426
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

31:25.469 --> 31:27.254
for me every time you show up

31:27.297 --> 31:29.691
reminding me
of what you did?!

31:29.734 --> 31:32.955
We were friends, Maggie.

31:32.999 --> 31:34.914
I trusted you.

31:34.957 --> 31:36.916
Oh, my God.

31:38.004 --> 31:39.048
I get it. I did this.

31:39.092 --> 31:40.920
I'm the treacherous friend.

31:40.963 --> 31:42.486
Lucy, I'm so sorry!

31:42.530 --> 31:43.879
I've been so selfish.

31:43.923 --> 31:45.794
Maggie doesn't care about you.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.491
You know what would
hurt her the most?

31:47.535 --> 31:49.102
If you jumped
to your death.

No!Time to bounce, Lucy. Jump!

32:04.334 --> 32:06.467
No!

32:08.599 --> 32:10.123
No!

32:12.386 --> 32:14.518
She's trying
to break my concentration.

32:14.562 --> 32:17.043
Figure out what the hell
this is, or Lucy is toast!

32:17.086 --> 32:18.435
Mortals can sometimes
conjure ghosts.

32:20.176 --> 32:22.918
"In which case, one
must heal the hurt

32:22.962 --> 32:24.528
of the conjurer
to vanquish it."

32:24.572 --> 32:27.096
We need to heal Lucy's hurt,
and not Brenda's,

32:27.140 --> 32:28.097
and I'm the one
who hurt her.

32:28.141 --> 32:30.056
Whatever it is, do it fast.

32:30.099 --> 32:31.492
Harry, can't you teleport
up there and get her?

32:31.535 --> 32:33.450
Oh, teleport into midair?Yeah.

32:33.494 --> 32:36.192
Oh, it's a bit unorthodox,
but yes, I suppose so.

32:43.547 --> 32:45.462
Lucy,

32:45.506 --> 32:47.595
I'm so sorry.

32:47.638 --> 32:50.467
She's lying.
Lucy, kill her!

32:52.469 --> 32:53.296
Maggie!

32:53.340 --> 32:55.690
Don't.
I was selfish.

32:55.733 --> 32:57.213
I wasn't a loyal friend,

32:57.257 --> 32:59.824
and then I played the victim,
like Brenda,

32:59.868 --> 33:02.218
because I felt excluded.

33:02.262 --> 33:04.351
I kept trying
to get you to forgive me,

33:04.394 --> 33:07.049
when what you really needed
was space.

33:07.093 --> 33:09.704
And I'm so sorry.

33:10.748 --> 33:12.924
Thank you.

33:17.146 --> 33:19.279
Whoa.

33:35.121 --> 33:37.645
You again.

33:39.908 --> 33:43.172
Ugh. My head is killing me.

33:43.216 --> 33:45.087
You, um...

33:45.131 --> 33:47.350
drank a lot
of wine coolers tonight.

33:47.394 --> 33:49.613
Wine coolers?

33:49.657 --> 33:52.007
That's a new low.

33:52.051 --> 33:55.663
Wait, what are
you doing here?

33:55.706 --> 33:58.753
And why do I feel
less mad at you?

33:58.796 --> 34:01.016
We had a talk
while you were drunk.

34:03.062 --> 34:06.152
And I'm gonna
give you some space.

34:06.195 --> 34:09.633
I would love if we could
be friends again someday.

34:09.677 --> 34:11.722

34:28.043 --> 34:31.002
Well, I have
to give her some space,

34:31.046 --> 34:33.962
but at least
she doesn't hate me.

34:34.005 --> 34:37.574
What about Kappa?

34:37.618 --> 34:39.794
Yeah, it's not happening.

34:41.535 --> 34:43.624
I'm sorry.

34:43.667 --> 34:47.149
I wasn't hearing how
important Kappa was to you.

34:47.193 --> 34:49.760
And we all need lives
outside of being a witch.

34:51.414 --> 34:54.374

start rebuilding mine.

34:56.941 --> 34:59.292

35:05.080 --> 35:07.735
I can feel
how sad you are.

35:07.778 --> 35:11.260
And I can smell how long
you've been wearing that shirt.

35:13.349 --> 35:15.917
I wore this the day we met.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.789
And it's like I don't
want to take it off,

35:18.833 --> 35:21.314

real, you know?

35:21.357 --> 35:24.143

And that's why I haven't
wanted to look for a new job.

35:27.146 --> 35:30.192
Then I'm really
starting a new life...

35:30.236 --> 35:31.802
without her.

35:32.890 --> 35:34.762
Yeah, it's hard to let go.

35:36.285 --> 35:39.636

36:10.885 --> 36:12.800
Yeah. What is it?

36:12.843 --> 36:15.542

about Galvin's mark.

36:15.585 --> 36:17.718
Uh, a priestess, really.

36:17.761 --> 36:20.024
She told me
I have darkness in me.

36:20.068 --> 36:22.331
