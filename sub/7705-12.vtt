00:13.280 --> 00:16.615
Willie...your Uncle Doug
is dead.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.952
Uncle Doug's been dead
for two years.

00:19.954 --> 00:23.989
I know. So, stop sending him
Christmas cards.

00:23.991 --> 00:25.958
Oh, Willie,
I-I want you to see this.

00:25.960 --> 00:29.128
Look, here. The very first
Christmas card we ever got.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.462
[groans]

00:30.464 --> 00:32.664
"From our good friends..

00:32.666 --> 00:35.167
...at the gas company."

00:35.169 --> 00:37.369
Oh, that was a good first
Christmas, wasn't it?

00:37.371 --> 00:39.905
We relaxed,
we-we stayed in bed late.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.740
Hmm, it was too cold to get up.

00:41.742 --> 00:44.143
Our friends at the gas company..

00:44.145 --> 00:46.145
...turned off the heat.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.813
But, uh, as I recall

00:47.815 --> 00:50.315
we, uh, we weren't in any
big hurry to get up anyway.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.484
- Hmm.
- 'Merry Christmas!'

00:58.426 --> 01:00.659

01:00.661 --> 01:03.495
I've hidden all the eggs.

01:03.497 --> 01:07.066
ALF, we hide eggs at Easter,
not at Christmas.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.200
Oh, that's right.

01:08.202 --> 01:11.737
Christmas is when
we carve the pumpkin.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.672
Oh, you two get these
holidays straightened out

01:13.674 --> 01:15.674
I think I'll just go
make breakfast.

01:15.676 --> 01:19.011
Not necessary.
I already made breakfast.

01:19.013 --> 01:21.180
Sloppy Joes and fiberglass.

01:23.017 --> 01:25.117
I'll just go find the eggs.

01:26.187 --> 01:29.121
Why did you, uh,
make us breakfast?

01:29.123 --> 01:30.622
Because of the list.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.691
- What list?
- Santa's.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.394
You know, the fat guy
that dresses in velvet?

01:35.396 --> 01:38.197
I found out that he watches
everything you do..

01:38.199 --> 01:39.364
...writes it down

01:39.366 --> 01:42.201
and if your naughties
outnumber your nices..

01:42.203 --> 01:44.269
...you don't get toys.

01:44.271 --> 01:47.539
- So, you made us breakfast.
- It can't hurt.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.641
Oh, oh, and I've got
another surprise for ya!

01:49.643 --> 01:51.076
- 'Yeah?'
- 'Willie.'

01:51.078 --> 01:53.445
(Kate)
'Our Christmas tree!'

01:53.447 --> 01:56.215
ALF, what have you done?

01:56.217 --> 01:58.350
I don't wanna spoil
the surprise.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.791
ALF, you cut our tree
into firewood.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.961

There's, uh, there's Dasher,
Dancer, Comet, Cupid.

03:31.912 --> 03:35.347
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

03:35.349 --> 03:38.984
No, it's Prancer, Dancer..

03:41.722 --> 03:43.388
Huey, Dewey and Louie.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.692
No, those are ducks.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.995
Then how do they
pull the sled?

03:49.997 --> 03:53.532
Okay, the lights are ready.
Now, all we need is a tree.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.001
Well, your dad should be here
with a new one soon.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.670
- What's taking him so long?
- Oh, you know your father.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.372
He has to find
just the perfect tree.

04:00.374 --> 04:03.542
Well, I hope he makes
it back before it snows.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.877
It's gonna snow? Neat!

04:05.879 --> 04:08.213
- No, it's not!
- Sure, it is.

04:08.215 --> 04:12.117
It always snows at Christmas.
I saw it on TV.

04:12.119 --> 04:16.722
All the stuff floats down
and covers the whole town

04:16.724 --> 04:20.192
and people go sledding
and make snowmen.

04:20.194 --> 04:24.096
Then Santa slides in
on a rotary shaver.

04:24.098 --> 04:27.966
ALF, it doesn't snow
in this part of the state.

04:27.968 --> 04:32.771
Wait a minute. I saw snow on
"Mr. T's Christmas Special."

04:32.773 --> 04:35.307
And they tape in Burbank.

04:35.309 --> 04:39.378
- ALF, that was fake snow.
- Well, that's it for Christmas.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.382
ALF, uh, it is possible
to have Christmas without snow.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.985
I don't wanna talk about it.
Let's move on to New Year's.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.887
Mom, I found another egg.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.456
Oh, ALF, you said
you got them all.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.158
All but that one. I swear.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.761
Here's one more.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.563
And the one in the philodendron.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.499
Oh, hi. I'm sorry, I'm late.

05:00.501 --> 05:03.635
- Hi, dad. What's in the box?
- 'Hi, honey.'

05:03.637 --> 05:05.737
Where's the tree?
Where's the tree?

05:05.739 --> 05:08.073
The tree. The-the box.

05:08.075 --> 05:11.576
Uh...let-let me just explain.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.045
Why-why are you holding eggs?

05:14.181 --> 05:16.782
- Didn't you get a tree?
- Oh, no.

05:16.784 --> 05:20.252
I mean, yes.
I-I-I mean...yes.

05:20.254 --> 05:22.587
Let's start with
a simple question.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.423
What's your name?

05:24.425 --> 05:27.993
Please, please, let me try
to explain this in my way.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.629
You see, I went
to every lot in town.

05:30.631 --> 05:33.432
I found lots. Empty lots.

05:33.434 --> 05:37.069
Except one where
this man named Fahid..

05:38.172 --> 05:40.272
...had just this one tree left.

05:40.274 --> 05:41.473
So, where is it?

05:41.475 --> 05:45.010
He was auctioning it off
to the highest bidder.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.479
I-I dropped out
when the price got to a $100.

05:47.481 --> 05:50.182
- I-I have my pride.
- And we have no tree.

05:50.184 --> 05:54.453
We have a tree.
We have a Christmas tree.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.288
And it's right here.

05:56.290 --> 05:57.789
Behind the box?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.224
It's in the box.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.226
A fake tree.

06:02.162 --> 06:05.230
It's a lifelike simulated tree.
Yes.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.966
What do you do?
Just add water?

06:07.968 --> 06:11.336
No, we put it together,
together.

06:11.338 --> 06:14.239
Yeah, it-it'll be
a fun family project.

06:14.241 --> 06:17.509
And it comes with
a can of simulated snow.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.977
If you had gotten two cans

06:18.979 --> 06:21.546
we could have made
a simulated snowman.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.818
"One hundred and twenty five."
What does that mean?

06:26.820 --> 06:30.355
"$125." That's the price.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.890
Is my math way off

06:31.892 --> 06:34.926
or is that more than
you would've paid Fahid?

06:35.829 --> 06:38.697
It's more, but it's less.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.298
I'm talking to Carnac.

06:41.335 --> 06:44.669
It's more now,
but it will be less

06:44.671 --> 06:49.241
because you see this tree
is guaranteed for 25 years.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.343
Now, if you amortize that
for the whole period

06:51.345 --> 06:53.445
that's just, that's just
five dollars a year.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.882
So, uh, we're gonna be stuck
with this thing

06:56.884 --> 06:59.017
for over a quarter of a century.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.353
When you see it assembled
it will be fine.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.188
- You'll see.
- I agree.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.791
- I think a fake tree is fine.
- Mm-hmm. And I'm with Lynn.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.192
It doesn't matter
what kind of tree it is.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.461
The tree is just a symbol.
Right, Brian?

07:09.463 --> 07:12.097
- What's a symbol?
- He agrees.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.199
Well, this whole thing
stinks if you ask me.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.467
Nobody is asking you.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.036
Well, I'm not waiting
for an invitation.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.038
First, you dropped
the fake snow on me

07:20.040 --> 07:22.140
then you come waltzing in here

07:22.142 --> 07:24.042
with this miserable
excuse for a tree.

07:24.044 --> 07:28.113
May I remind you, it was<i> you </i>
who chopped up our real tree?

07:28.115 --> 07:29.881

No, no. ALF, they're caroling.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.461
Then why are they singing?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.964
- Kevin's out there!
- Yeah.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.233
- And Melisa.
- Hi!

07:48.235 --> 07:50.769
- Can I go with them?
- Well, I don't see why not?

07:50.771 --> 07:52.971
- Let's all go.
- Yeah.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.073
- Honey, let's go.
- Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just..

07:55.075 --> 07:58.009
Uh, no, you know what,
I-I wanna stay here

07:58.011 --> 07:59.778
a-a-and-and assemble the tree.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.347
I'll catch up with you at
the manger by the gas station.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.082
Well, honey, I don't want
you to miss the caroling.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.319
I'm not gonna miss the caroling.
No, no!

long to put together

08:09.423 --> 08:11.189

when you get back.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.192
- Okay.
- Bye.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.828

let Brian go caroling?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.430
Well, sure, why not?

08:18.432 --> 08:22.434
Well, on Melmac, caroling was
definitely not for children.

08:22.436 --> 08:23.668
How come?

be worried sick about me.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.367
- Well, do you wanna go home?
- Yes.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.637
I mean, I haven't even seen
that snow you promised.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.639
Just mud.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.941
I never promised snow. You did.

11:16.943 --> 11:20.779
Oh, yeah.
You promised trees.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.714
Alright. You win!

11:22.716 --> 11:24.349
We'll turn around
to the next road

11:24.351 --> 11:26.685
we'll go home,
I'll work on the plastic tree

11:26.687 --> 11:28.153
until it's finished.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.989
Great! We'll have
Christmas in March.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.458
Will you just tell me
where the next road is, okay?

11:33.460 --> 11:34.793
Fine.

11:37.631 --> 11:40.298
Alright, there's, uh, there's
a road coming up right now.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.133
- Where?
- Uh, up ahead.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.568
- Where?
- Uh, there it is now.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.570
- Turn here. Quick!
- Uh, you sure there's a road--

11:45.572 --> 11:47.338
Yes, yes, right here.
I'm sure. I'm positive!

11:47.340 --> 11:49.274
- Alright!
- Yeah.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.382
No, wait.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.289
Fine. Now, we're stuck.

12:06.760 --> 12:10.862
If I'm not home before Santa
gets there, I'll sue you.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.630
[instrumental music]

12:18.672 --> 12:19.938
Willie!

12:19.940 --> 12:22.173
ALF!

12:22.175 --> 12:23.441
Anybody?

12:23.443 --> 12:26.244
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

12:28.181 --> 12:31.750
See. I told you
this is how it's gonna look.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.853
I'm sure dad isn't
finished with it yet.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.321
I wonder where they are.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.356
Here we go.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.392
Oh, they went to
cut down a real tree.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.228
Mom, they've been
gone a long time.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.463
They went to
"McCarnal's Tree Farm."

12:45.465 --> 12:46.865
You know, we used to cut
our Christmas tree

12:46.867 --> 12:48.800
down there every year.

12:48.802 --> 12:51.736
First, we got lost there
every year too.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.471
¶ Deck the halls

12:53.473 --> 12:54.806

12:54.808 --> 12:56.207

12:56.209 --> 12:59.210
Knock, knock. Guess who?

12:59.212 --> 13:01.279
(in unison)
Mr. Ochmonek!

13:01.281 --> 13:02.781
How is everybody?

13:02.783 --> 13:06.317
Oh, well, actually, we're, uh..
We're-we're fine, Trevor.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.719
Come on in.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.088
- Thanks, Kate.
- Oh.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.689
Merry Christmas!

13:12.292 --> 13:13.625
[kissing]

13:13.627 --> 13:16.294
[chuckling]
Merry Christmas, Trevor.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.763
Gosh! I love this holiday.

13:18.765 --> 13:19.998
Good will..

13:20.000 --> 13:22.133
...visiting with
the neighbors..

13:22.135 --> 13:24.335
...sharing a little eggnog.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.740
<i> Sharing a little eggnog.</i>

13:28.742 --> 13:30.408
Would you like some eggnog,
Mr. Ochmonek?

13:30.410 --> 13:31.776
If it's not too much trouble.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.312
- I'll get you some.
- Heavy on the brandy.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.814
[scoffs]
I know.

13:36.650 --> 13:37.515
Yeah.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.450
Place looks great.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.985
Oh, thank you.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.787
Beautiful decorations.

13:42.789 --> 13:46.357
Stockings hung
by the chimney with care.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.992
What the hell is this?

13:48.962 --> 13:50.662
It's our Christmas tree.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.697
I thought it was a coatrack.

13:52.699 --> 13:56.134
No. Dad hasn't finished
putting it together.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.735
Aah! hmm.

13:59.673 --> 14:00.939
Aah!

14:00.941 --> 14:04.142
- So where is the old man?
- He's in the woods.

14:04.144 --> 14:07.378
You mean like a religious
thing? A pilgrimage?

14:07.380 --> 14:10.448
Well, uh, he brought home this
artificial Christmas tree--

14:10.450 --> 14:11.950
So you kicked him out.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.786
No, uh, he went to
cut down a real one.

14:14.788 --> 14:18.056
In that case,
I'll have another eggnog.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.157
Hold the eggnog this time.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.359
[chuckles]
I know.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.627
[chuckling]

14:22.629 --> 14:24.429
[instrumental music]

14:25.832 --> 14:28.900
Okay, I've put the board in
the wheel and I'm gonna push.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.468
So when I say now

14:30.470 --> 14:32.971
you release the brake
and press accelerator, okay?

14:32.973 --> 14:34.172
Do what?

14:34.174 --> 14:37.308
<i> Release the brake</i>
<i> and press the accelerator.</i>

14:37.310 --> 14:38.643
<i> Okay.</i>

14:39.212 --> 14:40.245
[engine revving]

14:40.247 --> 14:43.047
Turn it off, turn it off!

14:57.097 --> 14:58.830
Well, thank you.

15:00.667 --> 15:04.502
Now...we are completely stuck.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.905
Alone till spring.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.375
This is just terrible.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.411
I'm stranded...on Christmas Eve.

15:13.413 --> 15:17.448
Yeah, this would never happen
to Sonny Crockett.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.350
- What?
- It wouldn't.

15:19.352 --> 15:22.086
He has a car phone.
He can call for help.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.524
I'd love to do that, ALF.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.693
I'd love to be Superman.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.429
Then I could fly out of here.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.765
Well, now you're being silly.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.466
[exhales]

15:38.104 --> 15:39.604
[clicks tongue]

15:39.606 --> 15:41.706
A whisker for your thoughts.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.875
[chuckles]
What?

15:43.877 --> 15:47.445
On Melmac, that's how
you get someone to open up.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.717
Oh, I was just thinking..

15:52.719 --> 15:55.553
...about it's being Christmas..

15:55.555 --> 15:57.789
...not having a tree.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.657
It sounds like
it's gonna be sentimental.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.659
- No.
- Mind if I turn on some music?

16:01.661 --> 16:04.395
Yeah, go ahead.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.397
I don't know,
even when I was a kid

16:06.399 --> 16:08.967
I think the most
important thing was..

16:08.969 --> 16:11.636
...that we had that tree.
A real tree.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.738
My dad used to bring it home
on Christmas Eve

16:13.740 --> 16:16.307
and we'd all decorate it,
the whole family.

16:16.309 --> 16:20.511
We'd all pitch in, me and
my brother, my Uncle Dough.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.413
Incidentally my condolences.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.048
Oh, thanks.

16:26.252 --> 16:30.088
You know, sometimes there wasn't
enough money to buy presents.

16:30.090 --> 16:34.025
But there always was that tree.
A real tree.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.996
We'd keep that tree up until..

16:37.998 --> 16:40.665
...every last needle was gone.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.767
I remember one 4th of July--

16:42.769 --> 16:45.169
Mind if I switch on
to the ball game?

16:46.873 --> 16:48.873
You just..
You don't get it, do you?

16:48.875 --> 16:50.775
Sure, I do.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.844
I'm just trying
to keep from crying.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.513
Yeah, huh?

16:56.616 --> 16:59.450
Then, let's just, uh, sit here..

16:59.452 --> 17:01.285
...and be quiet, okay?

17:01.287 --> 17:02.553
Okay.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.390
Being quiet.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.924
Waiting patiently.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.794
Saying nothing.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.831
How did your Uncle Dough die?

17:13.833 --> 17:16.801
He was talking too much
and somebody hit him.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.773
Fine, back to quiet.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.576
We'll just sit here
and listen to the mud.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.051
[instrumental music]

17:39.325 --> 17:42.093
- Oh!
- Oh!

17:42.095 --> 17:45.730
Oh, mother!
Everything looks so<i> beautiful.</i>

17:45.732 --> 17:48.399
Yeah, I can't wait for dad
to get here with the tree

17:48.401 --> 17:52.870
so we can decorate it together.
Like we do every year.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.273
Nothing is as much fun
without him as it is with him.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.607
[sighs]
Oh, yes.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.776
He is an excellent
husband and father.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.545
[Willie scatting]

18:00.547 --> 18:02.580
That must be him now.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.681
I'll get the door.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.017
No, let me.

18:06.019 --> 18:09.253
- Why don't we all go?
- Fine.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.988
[Willie scatting]

18:13.526 --> 18:14.692
[sighs]

18:14.694 --> 18:16.527
Merry Christmas, everyone.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.695
[all gasping]

18:17.697 --> 18:20.064
What a<i> beautiful tree!</i>

18:20.066 --> 18:22.767
Oh, dad, it's even more
beautiful than last year.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.936
Oh, you really outdid yourself.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.071
- Thank you.
- Where ever did you get it?

18:27.073 --> 18:29.874
Fahid gave it to me.
Absolutely free.

18:29.876 --> 18:34.112
He's such a nice man.
Now, we can decorate it.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.780
Isn't this great?

18:35.782 --> 18:38.716
Two perfect kids,
a beautiful wife.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.886
A big tree!
Could anyone want more?

18:41.888 --> 18:45.223
I agree. It really
is a wonderful life.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.324
How could it not be?

18:46.326 --> 18:48.059
I mean, it's not like
we've got an alien

18:48.061 --> 18:49.560
living with us or anything.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.929
Oh, why, dad, why would
you say a thing like that?

18:51.931 --> 18:55.066
Oh, uh-huh.
I don't know.

18:55.068 --> 18:58.236
Brian, why don't you get
the cranberries and popcorn?

18:58.238 --> 18:59.504
I'll get the tinsel.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.906
- Come on, Brian.
- Don't forget the star.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.075
[gasps]
Oh, excuse me, dear

19:04.077 --> 19:07.678
but doesn't the tree lean a
little bit too much to the left?

19:07.680 --> 19:10.248
Oh, I don't think so.
It looks fine to me.

19:10.250 --> 19:14.152
[scoffs]
Well, it's not fine to me.
Not fine at all.

19:14.154 --> 19:17.121
I'd better call
the tree repairman.

19:17.123 --> 19:19.423
Operator, get me
the tree repairman.

19:19.425 --> 19:20.925
The tree repairman?

19:20.927 --> 19:22.527
Oh, I don't think there's
any such thing as a--

19:22.529 --> 19:23.761
He's on his way.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.263
[doorbell dings]

19:25.265 --> 19:26.831
Maybe that's him now.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.433
But...but we don't<i> need</i> any..

19:29.435 --> 19:31.669
Tree repairman.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.472
Oh, see you got
a leaner there.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.141
Oh, my God! It's him!

19:37.143 --> 19:39.977
Kate, don't let him
touch the tree.

19:39.979 --> 19:43.414
Relax, pal,
I'll only be a minute.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.150
What are you doing here?

19:46.152 --> 19:48.119
This is my dream.
You can't be in this.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.954
[scoffs]
Oops! Here, hold this.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.822
Get away from my tree!

19:51.824 --> 19:53.624
Oh, here we go, lady!

19:53.626 --> 19:56.327
I found the problem
with your tree.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.628
It's a fake!

19:57.630 --> 20:01.332
You bought a fake tree?

20:01.334 --> 20:03.000
Willie, you should be ashamed.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.835
But, it's-it's not a fake.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.305
I mean, it wasn't
until he got here!

20:07.307 --> 20:11.809
Look at our perfect Christmas.
It's unravelling.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.011
[scoffs]
What's he whining about now?

20:14.013 --> 20:15.846
He bought a fake tree.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.816
<i> That figures.</i>

20:18.818 --> 20:20.685
Why are you dressed like that?

20:20.687 --> 20:22.520
My boyfriends are
coming by to get me

20:22.522 --> 20:26.290
so I don't have to help decorate
this synthetic stump.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.494
You're ruining my dream.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.063
I can't fix this here.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.298
I'm gonna have to
take it into the shop.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.568
Bye, mom,
I'm leaving for some

20:37.570 --> 20:39.537
unnamed
Central American country.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.205
Mm-hmm.

20:41.207 --> 20:44.342
But, Brian, I thought we
were gonna decorate the tree.

20:44.344 --> 20:48.012
Later, dad, I'm off to
stem the tide of communism.

20:52.518 --> 20:53.517
[doorbell dings]

20:53.519 --> 20:55.253
That'll be my lover.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.994
You're ready to go, babe?

21:04.430 --> 21:05.563
Don't wait up.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.098
He he he.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.700
This is your fault.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.203
You tree should be
ready around Easter.

21:12.205 --> 21:13.437
But call first.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.373
Here's your stuff.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.375
You are not taking my tree.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.709
I want my tree.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.544
I want my tree.

21:20.546 --> 21:21.646
- I want my tree.
- 'Ah!'

21:21.648 --> 21:22.913
I want my tree.

21:22.915 --> 21:26.217
I want my tree.
I want my tree.

21:26.219 --> 21:29.387
Lighten up, Willie.
You got it.

21:29.389 --> 21:32.790
- Oh, wha-what's going on here?
- Nothing.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.059
I just loaded
a tree into the car.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.727
W-where did you get it?

21:36.729 --> 21:39.830
Think, Willie,
where do we get trees?

21:39.832 --> 21:40.898
Do you mean
you went out to the woods

21:40.900 --> 21:42.733
to cut down this tree for me?

21:42.735 --> 21:44.435
Isn't that what
we came here for?

21:44.437 --> 21:47.638
ALF! Oh, I don't-I don't
know what to say?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.006
Well, you better say it quick.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.175
There's a forest ranger
headed this way.

21:51.177 --> 21:53.778
He must have heard the chainsaw.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.112
Well, at least..

21:55.114 --> 21:56.614
At least we're going
to get help.

21:56.616 --> 21:57.815
And we're going to get home.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.551
And...we're going to get fined.

22:03.589 --> 22:06.490
Willie! Willie, look!

22:06.492 --> 22:08.592
- It's snow.
- Snow!

22:08.594 --> 22:11.929
I finally get to see snow.

22:11.931 --> 22:15.399
(male #1 on loudspeaker)
'You in there, I wanna talk
to you about that tree.'

22:21.007 --> 22:22.440
Merry Christmas, ALF.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.709
(ALF)
'Merry Christmas, Willie.'

22:24.711 --> 22:26.110
Yes.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.046
[instrumental music]

22:33.886 --> 22:35.119
[instrumental music]

22:36.656 --> 22:38.122
This is great, Brian.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.791
It's for giving eye exams,
right?

22:40.793 --> 22:44.095
No, you look into it
and you push the button.

22:45.631 --> 22:47.531
It's Sylvester and Tweety.

22:48.401 --> 22:51.068
Hah! Die, cat, die!

22:51.070 --> 22:53.537
- Yeah!
- What a great Christmas!

22:53.539 --> 22:57.241
Yeah, and we ended up
with a really beautiful tree.

22:57.243 --> 22:58.476
It should be.

22:58.478 --> 23:03.414
It cost me $367, what,
with the fine and the tolling.

23:03.416 --> 23:08.819
A small price to pay for keeping
a poor boy's dream alive.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.988
Who are these presents for?

23:10.990 --> 23:12.757
Oh, I almost forgot.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.893
A few tokens from the old ALFer.

23:15.895 --> 23:19.897
Oh, you got us presents?
ALF, you can't shop.

23:19.899 --> 23:23.667
This is America, Kate.
Everybody can shop.

23:23.669 --> 23:27.104
- I used a catalogue.
- A catalogue? From where?

23:27.106 --> 23:29.006
The Hardware Hamlet.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.142
- My account?
- Who else's?

23:32.378 --> 23:35.413
Thanks, ALF.
Look, a staple gun.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.782
Neat! A leaf blower.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.017
I hope that's the kind you like.

23:40.019 --> 23:43.854
Goodness!
Uh, a rotary sander for me.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.356
Weather stripping.

23:45.358 --> 23:46.557
My, my!

23:46.559 --> 23:48.426
It is the thought that counts.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.362
And the important thing is
we're all together.

23:51.364 --> 23:55.633
In the words of the immortal
St. Frosty The Snowman

23:55.635 --> 23:58.836
"God bless us all. Everyone."

24:00.440 --> 24:02.640
[whirring]

24:02.642 --> 24:04.809
[instrumental music]

24:07.146 --> 24:09.013
[theme music]

24:34.440 --> 24:36.407
Merry Christmas!
