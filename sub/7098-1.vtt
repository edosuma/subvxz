Help! Help! Help! Help!

04:17.903 --> 04:20.264
Help! Help! Help!

04:20.384 --> 04:23.945
Oh, God, no!

04:30.627 --> 04:33.108
Help!

04:38.829 --> 04:42.030
Please! Please! Stop! Stop!

04:46.111 --> 04:48.872
No! No!

04:50.953 --> 04:53.634
Please! Please!

04:53.754 --> 04:56.995
No! No!

04:57.115 --> 04:59.115
Please, no!

05:12.519 --> 05:15.320
No! Stop it! Please! No! No! No!

05:16.321 --> 05:21.282
- Put her down! Put her down!
- Let me go! No! Stop it!

05:22.763 --> 05:25.723
- No! No!
- Come on!

05:26.684 --> 05:29.565
Shut up! Shut up!

05:53.132 --> 05:55.533
Who the fuck are you?

06:01.174 --> 06:03.695
Death.

06:45.827 --> 06:47.868
Please... please...

06:49.148 --> 06:51.869
Please don't... Don't do it, please.

06:53.070 --> 06:55.070
Please don't! Please!

07:20.718 --> 07:24.198
Traffic light
heading into downtown Los Angeles.

07:24.319 --> 07:30.041
Expect temperatures in the high 80s and about
10 degrees warmer in the San Fernando Valley.

07:30.161 --> 07:33.161
You're listening to KBLA Los Angeles.

07:46.886 --> 07:48.886
Working hard, huh?

07:50.126 --> 07:54.928
- Hi, Erica.
- Is this your design for the new art centre?

07:55.048 --> 07:58.009
- It must be a real charge.
- It is.

07:58.129 --> 08:01.450
- I did some new drawings.
- Let me see them.

08:08.132 --> 08:12.493
- You feeling OK?
- Yeah, sure. What do you think?

08:18.455 --> 08:21.456
- Look s pretty good.
- Yeah?

08:23.217 --> 08:26.297
Yeah. Not great, but pretty damn good.

08:27.738 --> 08:30.658
Hold on a minute.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.900
- Hello?
- How's it going?

08:38.020 --> 08:40.701
Everything's fine. Erica's here.

08:40.821 --> 08:44.502
- Thank s for working with her.
- She's a pleasure.

08:44.623 --> 08:47.824
Very talented too, which reminds me...

08:47.944 --> 08:52.785
- Your article on battered wives, good story.
- Did you like it?

08:52.905 --> 08:55.587
- Did it make you angry?
- Absolutely.

08:55.706 --> 09:00.588
- Are you still coming for dinner?
- Sure. I'll leave here about six.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.390
- Be home by 10.30.
- 10.30?

09:10.511 --> 09:15.672
- 11.00.
- Mom! That's Randy. Got to go.

09:15.792 --> 09:21.194
- When I say 11.00, I mean 11.00.
- All right. If I were you guys,

09:21.314 --> 09:24.195
I'd forget the movie and stay home.

09:24.315 --> 09:27.076
Oh, yeah? Get out of here.

09:27.196 --> 09:29.196
Bye.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.720
- How are you doing?
- Great.

10:27.333 --> 10:32.695
What do you think I am? The starvation army?
You don't pay, you don't play.

10:32.815 --> 10:38.057
- Come on, man. Come on, JoJo. Come on.
- You heard the man. Take a walk.

10:48.300 --> 10:51.301
- Hey, guys.
- How are you doing, man?

10:51.420 --> 10:55.542
- Look at her. Ain't she cute? Let's chat.
- I'll be right with you.

10:55.662 --> 11:00.023
- We've got business to discuss.
- We do? Thank you very much.

11:00.144 --> 11:03.145
- I'll get Erica.
- What have you got planned?

11:05.625 --> 11:11.627
Erica, I've got some special chips for you.
Hey, just like I promised.

11:15.148 --> 11:18.189
- You're gonna love them.
- Thank s.

11:18.309 --> 11:23.190
Remember, there's just enough for you,
so don't tell your boyfriend.

11:23.310 --> 11:24.830
Yeah, sure.

11:26.671 --> 11:29.272
The movie starts at 8.30.

11:29.352 --> 11:34.193
Two-hour movie. It means we can get back
before Erica gets home.

11:34.313 --> 11:39.915
- Good.
- What do you think about that boy Randy?

11:40.035 --> 11:45.997
Well, he does well in school.
He's a nice kid. Why?

11:46.117 --> 11:50.159
I'm just worried about Erica.
I feel like she were my daughter.

11:50.918 --> 11:55.480
That's nice. She feels the same way about you.
She loves you.

11:58.160 --> 12:02.202
- So do I.
- And I love you both.

12:02.322 --> 12:08.444
- We'd better go or we'll miss the movie.
- You are not getting out of it that easily.

12:11.444 --> 12:14.526
We've been going out for two years now...

12:15.846 --> 12:17.846
...and...

12:19.647 --> 12:22.448
You want a commitment.

12:22.568 --> 12:26.169
Yeah. I would like that.

12:31.570 --> 12:33.571
Hello. Yes.

12:37.293 --> 12:39.053
Oh, my God!

12:40.413 --> 12:43.735
- Randy, what's going on?
- Mrs. Sheldon? I'm Dr. Rosenblatt.

12:43.855 --> 12:46.335
- What happened?
- She had a cocaine overdose.

12:46.455 --> 12:49.536
- Erica doesn't use drugs!
- She did tonight.

12:49.656 --> 12:54.377
- Code Blue in Room Six.
- Doctor, she's arrested with no pulse.

12:54.497 --> 12:57.738
- She get Narcan and glucose?
- Four amps. No response.

12:57.858 --> 13:02.379
- You can't come in. Wait outside.
- Alice, we've got to shock her.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.820
Everybody off? Off? Clear!

13:07.341 --> 13:11.062
Continue CPR. Come on, don't stop.
Give me 300 Watts.

13:16.704 --> 13:20.225
Everybody off! Everybody off! Clear!

13:20.345 --> 13:24.027
Continue. She's still fibrillating.
All right, let's give her lidocaine.

13:24.147 --> 13:27.107
75mg, IV, and shock her one more time.

13:27.227 --> 13:30.948
- Fixed and dilated.
- Don't stop! Let me see that.

13:33.750 --> 13:37.711
We've lost her.

13:43.792 --> 13:45.793
Mrs. Sheldon...

13:47.594 --> 13:49.914
I'm really sorry.

14:39.489 --> 14:41.489
You bastard!

14:43.010 --> 14:45.531
Leave your hands off me! Get out!

15:02.415 --> 15:06.457
It ain't my fault about your girlfriend.
The stuff was too strong.

15:08.698 --> 15:09.898
Bullshit!

15:11.218 --> 15:13.219
You killed her!

15:16.980 --> 15:23.342
- I didn't kill anyone. Nobody made her smoke it.
- Let's see what the cops have to say.

15:25.102 --> 15:31.424
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You figure it out! You gave her the package.

15:32.344 --> 15:36.265
I'm going to the police!
I'm going to tell them everything!

15:40.067 --> 15:44.708
Read my lips! Cops! Policemen!
You're gonna die like she died!

15:46.148 --> 15:48.950
Kiss your white ass goodbye, my man!

16:00.473 --> 16:02.554
Hey!

16:25.400 --> 16:29.402
Stay in your cars! Stay in your cars!
Cut the power!

16:29.522 --> 16:33.282
Cut the goddamn power! Jesus! Cut the power!

16:43.246 --> 16:46.006
- What do you figure?
- JoJo was a dealer.

16:46.127 --> 16:50.728
He gets hassle from Randy Viscovich,
stabs him and gets shot by another dealer.

16:50.848 --> 16:54.649
- Why?
- They don't need a reason to kill each other.

16:54.770 --> 16:59.371
Sergeant Reiner,
this kid saw the guy who did the shooting.

16:59.490 --> 17:02.251
- Not his face, but the car.
- Yeah?

17:02.371 --> 17:07.012
- Yeah. It was a Toronado. A blue Toronado.
- Did you get the license?

17:07.133 --> 17:12.334
- I got the last three numbers. It was 226.
- Sure that's all you remember?

17:12.454 --> 17:16.415
- I ain't a fucking detective, man. You are.
- Come on.

17:17.336 --> 17:20.176
Nice kid.

17:20.297 --> 17:23.778
- So, Phil, go play detective.
- Right.

18:11.392 --> 18:13.592
- Hello?
- Mr. Kersey?

18:13.712 --> 18:15.713
- Yes.
- You got my note?

18:15.833 --> 18:19.435
- Who is this?
- I think we should meet

18:19.555 --> 18:22.355
to discuss something of mutual interest.

18:22.475 --> 18:27.197
I'm not going anywhere
until I know who this is and what you want.

18:27.317 --> 18:32.319
If you refuse, I'll tell the police all I know,
and I know a lot.

18:32.439 --> 18:35.439
Do I have your attention now? Good.

18:36.400 --> 18:40.440
If you look out your window,
you'll see a limousine out front.

18:50.644 --> 18:53.484
I'm looking forward to our meeting.

19:30.096 --> 19:32.096
Mr. Kersey.

19:33.577 --> 19:36.217
Good evening, Mr. Kersey.

19:36.337 --> 19:39.579
Or should I say, Mr. Vigilante?

19:41.138 --> 19:45.860
Listen, if this is about blackmail,
you're wasting your time.

19:45.980 --> 19:51.662
This place must be worth more than...
than I can make the rest of my life.

19:51.782 --> 19:55.063
- Do you know who I am?
- Should I?

19:56.143 --> 20:00.064
Does the name Nathan White
mean anything to you?

20:01.585 --> 20:04.425
You own a newspaper.

20:05.586 --> 20:09.107
It's not your money I'm after, Kersey.

20:09.227 --> 20:12.148
It's your professional skill.

20:13.149 --> 20:15.589
I want you to kill someone.

20:20.750 --> 20:24.672
My wife died in a car crash ten years ago.

20:24.792 --> 20:28.113
My daughter Lisa became my whole life.

20:29.634 --> 20:34.235
Last year, she started college.
Things were going wonderfully well.

20:35.355 --> 20:41.556
Then, suddenly everything changed. Her grades
went downhill, she dropped out of school.

20:45.278 --> 20:48.199
You see, she started using cocaine.

20:51.559 --> 20:53.561
Three months ago...

20:55.201 --> 20:57.282
...she died of...

21:01.842 --> 21:05.564
I know about your friend's daughter, Mr. Kersey.

21:05.684 --> 21:10.085
I know you shot the pusher who sold the drugs.
I ask you, sir...

21:12.046 --> 21:14.767
...what about the people behind him?

21:15.327 --> 21:19.328
How many children do we let them destroy

21:19.448 --> 21:24.049
before we say, "Enough", Mr. Kersey?
How many?

21:25.850 --> 21:31.212
I've spent a fortune buying information
on the major dealers in Los Angeles.

21:31.331 --> 21:34.893
I'll give you money, weapons,
names, anything you want.

21:39.694 --> 21:45.696
They're all murderers, Kersey, from the smallest
street-corner pusher to the fat cat at the top.

21:46.336 --> 21:49.337
Anybody connected with drugs deserves to die.

21:50.298 --> 21:52.698
They have to be stopped, Kersey.

21:54.898 --> 21:58.059
I need a few days to think about this.

22:10.103 --> 22:13.984
When Michael died, Erica was only five.

22:15.985 --> 22:18.585
I made a promise to her...

22:19.306 --> 22:25.388
...that no matter what happened,
she would always come first. I let her down.

22:25.508 --> 22:29.749
I was too involved with work
to see what was going on.

22:34.230 --> 22:38.912
You have to stop this.
I know how you feel because I've been there.

22:39.032 --> 22:45.033
You think you should have done something
different but it's not your fault that Erica died.

22:45.154 --> 22:47.514
It's those drugs.

22:48.755 --> 22:50.876
I'm so angry!

22:53.237 --> 22:57.517
I feel so helpless. I... I want to do something,

22:57.637 --> 23:01.959
but I don't know what to do.

23:03.279 --> 23:06.480
You're a writer. Write about it.

23:06.600 --> 23:10.921
Let people know about drugs.
Just keep pounding on it.

23:17.403 --> 23:20.204
- What story did you want to do?
- Drugs.

23:22.164 --> 23:27.166
- Oh, Karen, every single...
- I know I'm involved. That's why I have to do it.

23:27.286 --> 23:31.008
I want to know why she died
and who's responsible.

23:31.127 --> 23:36.329
Nobody cares. Everybody uses drugs now,
not just street junkies.

23:36.449 --> 23:39.930
Rich people, middle-class people,
doctors, secretaries...

23:40.050 --> 23:46.492
It's the new American way of life, Karen.
They know about it and they don't care.

23:46.612 --> 23:49.733
- We have to make them care.
- Come on, Karen.

23:49.853 --> 23:52.374
Pat, this is important to me.

23:52.494 --> 23:55.495
All right, but let me know what you're doing.

23:55.614 --> 23:59.616
I don't want the cops
finding your body in an alley. OK?

23:59.736 --> 24:01.337
All right.

24:03.617 --> 24:07.339
- You're sure you want to do this?
- Yes.

24:07.458 --> 24:11.060
OK. I just hope you've got a strong stomach.

24:11.860 --> 24:15.181
<i>- What paper did you say you were with?
- Tribune.</i>

24:16.381 --> 24:20.822
- You want to see the drug-related ones, right?
- Right.

24:22.263 --> 24:25.264
Ah... 18-year-old male.

24:25.384 --> 24:29.945
Died when his freebasing pipe exploded
in his face.

24:30.065 --> 24:32.666
Did you want to see the body?

24:46.310 --> 24:51.671
19-year-old male. Robbed a liquor store
to get money to buy drugs.

24:57.993 --> 25:00.594
17-year-old female.

25:02.675 --> 25:06.316
Died of a stroke from repeated cocaine use.

25:08.957 --> 25:13.959
13-year-old little girl. She was selling herself
on the street to support her habit

25:14.078 --> 25:17.959
- and one of her customers slashed her throat.
- 13 years old?

25:24.121 --> 25:26.322
Oh, God...

25:27.523 --> 25:29.523
They're all children!

25:30.323 --> 25:34.044
Yeah, that look s good. Here you go, my man.

25:34.164 --> 25:39.726
You have a good time. Enjoy yourselves.
You know where to come if you want more.

25:39.846 --> 25:41.846
Hello, hello.

25:43.647 --> 25:48.449
Yeah, hello, hello.
Look s like you're going to have a party tonight.

25:48.569 --> 25:52.930
You came to the right place.
I've got the primest prime money can buy.

25:53.050 --> 25:55.811
I don't want that. I want information.

25:55.930 --> 25:59.172
Brake to the left!

26:00.172 --> 26:04.613
- What kind of information?
- Who sells what, who work s for who?

26:04.733 --> 26:08.335
- What do you want it for?
- Does it matter?

26:08.455 --> 26:13.696
- You're no cop. You must be a reporter.
- If you're not interested, I'll go someplace else.

26:13.816 --> 26:19.458
I didn't say I wasn't interested. The information
you're talking about is going to cost more.

26:19.578 --> 26:23.339
- A lot more.
- How much more?

26:23.459 --> 26:29.461
This will be the last time we meet in my home.
We've got to be extremely cautious.

26:30.661 --> 26:33.462
There are two major drug organizations.

26:33.581 --> 26:39.184
One is run by Ed Zacharias, the other
by two brothers, Jack and Tony Romero.

26:39.304 --> 26:44.385
Between them, they control 90 per cent
of the narcotics traffic in Southern California.

26:44.505 --> 26:48.986
According to my sources,
the pusher you shot work s for Ed Zacharias.

26:49.106 --> 26:53.028
This is everything you'll need
on the Zacharias, Romero organizations,

26:53.148 --> 26:55.909
photos, biographies, everything.

26:58.069 --> 27:01.750
A year ago, Jack and Tony invaded
Zacharias's territory.

27:01.870 --> 27:06.231
It was the beginning of a gang war.
Zacharias negotiated a truce,

27:06.351 --> 27:11.033
but you can take it from me, the fuse was lit.
It's getting shorter.

27:13.434 --> 27:17.755
- I'll handle it my way, no interference from you.
- All right.

27:17.875 --> 27:21.556
I'll need a few things.
You said you could supply weapons?

27:24.958 --> 27:28.118
This is your man. He'll give you all you want.

27:35.081 --> 27:38.961
- Detective Gruer, call for line two.
- You won't believe this.

27:39.081 --> 27:44.203
I just talked to Forensics. They checked
the 9mm slug that killed JoJo Ross.

27:44.323 --> 27:47.124
I can never do these damn puzzles.

27:48.844 --> 27:53.046
It matches the slug from the mugger
shot two years ago.

27:53.166 --> 27:56.007
- So?
- He was killed by the vigilante.

27:56.126 --> 28:00.688
- Come on, Phil. The vigilante retired years ago.
- Look s like he's back.

28:00.808 --> 28:04.529
- It was him in the Toronado?
- Just came over the computer.

28:04.649 --> 28:09.410
There are 28 blue Toronados in the state
with the last three numbers 226.

28:09.530 --> 28:13.052
- Nine of them are in LA.
- Jesus...

28:13.891 --> 28:17.973
The vigilante...
Well, let's check them out.

28:18.774 --> 28:22.534
Send a copy to Michael Eddy and David Boston.

28:22.654 --> 28:25.256
- Mr. Kersey?
- Yes.

28:25.376 --> 28:30.257
- I'm Sergeant Reiner. This is Sergeant Nozaki.
- How can I help you?

28:30.377 --> 28:34.698
We're talking to a number of people
as part of a routine investigation.

28:34.818 --> 28:40.260
Could you tell us where you were last Tuesday
evening between seven and nine?

28:40.380 --> 28:43.821
Tuesday, I leave here about six.

28:44.861 --> 28:48.902
With the traffic and everything,
I get home about 6.45.

28:49.022 --> 28:52.823
- So you were home that night?
- As far as I remember.

28:52.943 --> 28:55.424
- Can someone confirm that?
- I was alone.

28:55.544 --> 28:58.145
I see.

28:58.265 --> 29:00.866
- Do you own a gun?
- No.

29:00.986 --> 29:03.386
- Are you married?
- No.

29:03.506 --> 29:05.508
Divorced?

29:06.428 --> 29:10.469
- My wife and daughter are dead.
- I'm very sorry.

29:10.589 --> 29:13.509
- Car accident?
- No.

29:13.629 --> 29:17.151
Well, that's about it. Sorry to have bothered you.

29:21.232 --> 29:26.234
- So, what do you think?
- We'd better find out more about Paul Kersey.

29:33.836 --> 29:38.037
Ed Zacharias grew up
in New York's South Bronx slum tenements.

29:38.157 --> 29:41.598
Started running errands for the mob
when he was 12.

29:41.718 --> 29:45.000
Graduated to numbers
and was recruited by the Mafia.

29:45.119 --> 29:47.800
Committed his first murder at 19.

29:47.920 --> 29:53.722
Charming delightful fellow.
Loves his work and indulges his fantasies.

30:15.728 --> 30:17.329
All right!

30:18.289 --> 30:24.090
I said no cake! There wasn't supposed to be
a cake. You're full of...

30:24.210 --> 30:27.692
- Happy birthday.
- Come on, Ed, blow the candles out.

30:27.812 --> 30:30.413
Watch this. Watch this.

30:31.052 --> 30:34.014
Let's see what you've got left. Let's go, Boss.

30:35.454 --> 30:39.095
- Come on!
- Go, go, go!

30:53.220 --> 30:55.981
- Champagne.
- We need ice.

30:56.101 --> 30:58.701
I'll get it. They want champagne.

31:04.943 --> 31:08.344
- How was the candle?
- Better than the cake.

31:08.464 --> 31:12.065
Oh, shit. Who invited them?

31:12.185 --> 31:14.666
I did. It's my party, remember?

31:21.268 --> 31:24.789
Jack, glad you could make it.
Still playing babysitter, huh?

31:26.670 --> 31:29.070
Hey, happy birthday.

31:31.551 --> 31:35.112
- Should I call the bomb squad?
- That's funny, Eddy.

31:35.872 --> 31:39.873
- It's Alex.
- Ferrino, hold that. Hello? Hello?

31:41.274 --> 31:44.234
Yeah. What?

31:50.197 --> 31:53.837
- Where's Vincent? Bring him to the game room.
- Sure.

32:07.561 --> 32:11.163
- Hey, Jack, Tony, I want to talk to you.
- Oh.

32:56.817 --> 33:00.737
- What's this all about?
- Somebody killed one of my pushers,

33:00.857 --> 33:03.939
a guy named JoJo Ross.

33:04.059 --> 33:09.700
I was wondering if maybe,
you knew something about it.

33:09.861 --> 33:12.501
- We didn't touch your errand boy!
- Shut up.

33:12.621 --> 33:15.102
Hey, just knock it off!

33:18.063 --> 33:22.464
I'm telling you, Ed...
we don't know a damn thing about this.

33:23.784 --> 33:27.946
You know, Jack,
I'd hate for trouble to start between us again.

33:29.066 --> 33:33.507
A lot of people could get hurt.
You understand what I'm saying?

33:33.627 --> 33:37.749
Ed, we're not looking for trouble.
We want to keep the peace.

33:37.868 --> 33:40.709
Good. Very good.

33:43.710 --> 33:48.352
- Vincent! How are you doing, lad?
- OK.

33:48.472 --> 33:52.473
- You know Jack and his brother Tony?
- Hey, Tony.

33:52.593 --> 33:56.274
- How are you? How about a drink?
- I'll have a screwdriver.

33:56.394 --> 34:00.235
- How was Colombia?
- Oh, terrific!

34:00.355 --> 34:04.716
The women had great tans.
Tits out to here, flopping all over.

34:04.836 --> 34:09.678
- You ought to go there.
- Oh, I know. Er... Vincent...

34:09.797 --> 34:13.639
I talked to Alex. He said you were right.

34:13.759 --> 34:16.159
- The shipment was light.
- I told you.

34:16.280 --> 34:20.402
I knew Rodriguez was skimming us.
You can't trust Colombians.

34:20.521 --> 34:24.362
- I know what you mean.
- You want me to take care of it?

34:24.483 --> 34:30.284
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll take care of that fuck personally.

34:34.284 --> 34:37.007
Rodriguez was not skimming.

34:37.846 --> 34:40.288
You were.

34:45.809 --> 34:49.130
Like I said, I don't like trouble.

35:04.014 --> 35:07.735
- What are you doing in here?
- I was using the toilet.

35:07.855 --> 35:09.856
Step out here.

35:12.297 --> 35:15.298
- What's your name?
- The name is Leo.

35:16.818 --> 35:20.300
Well, Leo, you look like a pretty smart guy.

35:20.419 --> 35:25.260
If you keep your mouth shut,
you could make some money.

35:25.381 --> 35:28.902
- Yeah. Right. I don't know nothing.
- Good.

35:29.022 --> 35:32.782
Since you're here,
why don't you help carry out the body?

36:34.842 --> 36:39.242
Ed Zacharias's organization functions
on the concept of fear.

36:39.363 --> 36:43.244
His main enforcers, Danny Moreno,
Art Sanella and Jack Stein,

36:43.364 --> 36:46.885
were expensively recruited
to execute this policy.

36:47.005 --> 36:51.847
They are efficient, always work together
and have a preference for Italian food.

36:51.967 --> 36:55.007
- Gino.
- Good afternoon, my friends.

36:55.128 --> 36:58.568
- Are we too late?
- We're open for you, Mr. Moreno.

36:58.689 --> 37:01.930
- Mr. Stein, Mr. Sanella.
- How is your family?

37:02.050 --> 37:04.530
They're fine, thank s. Come this way.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.863
Thank s.

37:48.824 --> 37:51.825
Hey, watch the water! You got it over me.

37:51.945 --> 37:54.785
- I'm sorry!
- Get back in the kitchen.

37:54.905 --> 37:56.906
Jesus!

38:01.107 --> 38:04.108
- Hi.
- Afternoon, sir. What can I do for you?

38:04.228 --> 38:09.590
My name is Jack Kimble.
I represent Sautelle Winery.

38:09.709 --> 38:12.351
It's a new winery in Napa Valley.

38:12.470 --> 38:16.671
I have a sample of the first pressing.
I thought you'd like a taste.

38:16.792 --> 38:20.473
- Have a glass handy?
- Sure.

38:21.473 --> 38:26.715
- You been to Napa Valley?
- No. I spend most of my time on the beach.

38:26.835 --> 38:30.436
- Beautiful country. You ought to go up there.
- I will.

38:31.236 --> 38:33.917
Tell me what you think.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.961
- Not bad.
- Let's see what your customers say.

38:46.081 --> 38:49.402
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- They'll love it.

38:54.003 --> 38:59.324
Gentlemen, it's your lucky day.
A bottle of wine on the house.

38:59.444 --> 39:02.646
- Don't I know you?
- I don't think so.

39:04.526 --> 39:09.207
Yeah, I know your face.
Did you ever live in San Francisco?

39:09.327 --> 39:13.049
- I'm from Idaho.
- I got a brother in Idaho. What city?

39:13.169 --> 39:15.570
- Boise.
- Boise.

39:15.690 --> 39:19.050
- I never forget a face.
- What the hell?

39:28.333 --> 39:32.655
- What the fuck is going on?
- I put the word out.

39:32.774 --> 39:35.176
- And?
- Nothing.

39:35.296 --> 39:40.737
- Bullshit. Somebody's trying to push us out.
- Maybe it's the Romeros.

39:40.857 --> 39:44.458
Oh, no, no, no. They wouldn't dare.

39:44.578 --> 39:47.579
- Who else could it be?
- I don't know.

39:47.699 --> 39:51.140
That's why I pay you,
to find out what's happening.

39:51.260 --> 39:54.902
So, do your job, or I'll get somebody else.

40:07.785 --> 40:12.346
The head of the Romero
street-dealing operations is Max Green.

40:12.466 --> 40:17.908
Numerous arrests for pimping,
child pornography, drug dealing, murder.

40:18.028 --> 40:20.028
No convictions.

40:20.148 --> 40:23.829
Witnesses against Max
have a habit of disappearing.

40:23.950 --> 40:27.431
He is a resident of Vegas, but when in LA,

40:27.551 --> 40:31.752
he operates out of a video rental store
on the West Side.

40:53.038 --> 40:56.039
I don't care if his dog brings it.

40:56.160 --> 41:01.841
I want that shipment by Friday
or I'll cut off his balls and make him eat them.

41:01.961 --> 41:04.402
Got that? Good.

41:13.324 --> 41:16.085
- What do you want?
- You.

41:16.205 --> 41:20.607
- I didn't do nothing.
- No, you just sell drugs to children.

41:20.727 --> 41:27.369
It's a business. I'm a supplier.
I don't make kids use drugs. It's their choice.

41:27.489 --> 41:32.170
- You don't do it, someone else will?
- That's right. That's exactly right.

41:33.330 --> 41:35.892
- How many?
- How many what?

41:36.012 --> 41:39.252
How many children have you killed
with this shit?

41:51.136 --> 41:57.697
- Six dead in 48 hours. We've got a gang war.
- We could just let them blow each other away.

41:57.818 --> 42:01.299
Bodies don't make good press
and there's an election coming.

42:01.419 --> 42:04.980
Well, we could run one of these suckers
for office.

42:05.100 --> 42:09.141
The Romeros lost three men.
Maybe they'll hit back. Who's their best shooter?

42:09.261 --> 42:12.222
- Frank Bauggs.
- OK, stake him out.

42:12.343 --> 42:17.303
- Maybe we'll get lucky.
- We've been after the vigilante. We're close...

42:17.424 --> 42:20.425
Forget the vigilante. This case has priority.

42:22.705 --> 42:25.546
Who does Zacharias think he's playing with?

42:25.666 --> 42:30.028
- It doesn't make sense. Why would he hit us?
- He wants a war.

42:30.148 --> 42:34.428
- Somebody's killing his men, too.
- I don't believe it. You know what I think?

42:34.549 --> 42:39.230
He did it and he's trying to blame us.
He's playing us for suckers.

42:39.350 --> 42:45.592
- He wants our territory.
- If there's war, he loses as much as we do.

42:45.712 --> 42:49.953
Come on, wake up!
Zacharias is trying to jack us up.

42:50.073 --> 42:53.234
It's either him or us. I say we blast him.

42:54.714 --> 42:58.476
The Romeros' number-one hit man
is Frank Bauggs.

42:58.596 --> 43:02.557
One conviction for assault with intent to kill.
Served easy time.

43:02.677 --> 43:08.199
Those who know his reputation for violence
would be surprised that he is a trained baritone.

43:09.199 --> 43:13.961
He is an upwardly-mobile super-achiever
and lives in a condo on Wilshire Boulevard.

43:14.081 --> 43:18.282
If you can get to his phones,
we'll have our leads.

43:18.401 --> 43:22.403
- God damn it, hurry up! We'll be late!
- My zipper's stuck.

43:22.523 --> 43:26.164
That's 'cause you eat like a horse.
Drop some weight.

43:26.284 --> 43:28.885
Drop dead, why don't you?

43:36.328 --> 43:39.928
For Christ's sake,
come out of there! Jesus...

43:42.729 --> 43:45.129
- How do I look?
- Like shit.

43:45.250 --> 43:49.131
- Stick it up your kazoo!
- Shut up and let's go.

43:58.734 --> 44:03.336
- What's wrong with my dress?
- I'm tired of this. I said it was tacky.

44:03.456 --> 44:06.536
The one you picked had purple roses.

44:06.656 --> 44:11.457
You look like a giant rooster in that one.
You wouldn't have been so long.

44:11.577 --> 44:15.379
- It's easier to put on.
- This one's easier to take off.

44:15.499 --> 44:20.340
- What are you complaining about?
- I don't know.

44:33.104 --> 44:36.506
So he pulled the trigger
and guess what?

44:36.626 --> 44:39.546
- What?
- The asshole forgot to load it.

44:39.666 --> 44:44.747
- Come on, Sid!
- A Mafia hit man and he forgot to load his gun.

44:54.350 --> 44:57.152
Here they are, folk s, Mr. And Mrs. Scumbag.

44:58.232 --> 45:02.113
- Why do we gotta go to the opera?
- 'Cause I like it.

45:02.233 --> 45:06.114
- At least they could sing in English.
- How would you know?

45:06.235 --> 45:10.235
- You can't speak English.
- Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.

45:10.355 --> 45:12.876
- You did.
- You came in second.

45:14.957 --> 45:17.558
Did you remember the tickets?

45:19.678 --> 45:24.840
- Damn! Joey, wait. I've got to go back.
- You'd forget your head if it wasn't screwed on.

45:24.960 --> 45:27.120
- Be right back.
- Don't hurry.

45:29.521 --> 45:31.842
What the hell?

47:05.110 --> 47:07.710
Hey, Joey, you got a light?

47:12.392 --> 47:16.113
He was in such a hurry.
He's probably playing with himself.

47:44.441 --> 47:47.882
Come on out, asshole. Come on out!

47:52.083 --> 47:56.285
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I was making a sandwich.

48:22.293 --> 48:26.894
Now, you're going to tell me
what the fuck you're doing here!

48:45.420 --> 48:49.381
He's such a jerk. I wish he'd drop dead.

48:56.023 --> 48:57.863
Christ!

49:01.024 --> 49:05.505
- Hold it!
- Let me go! Let me go!

49:07.026 --> 49:10.747
- Which apartment? You've got one second!
- 1201, all right?

49:10.867 --> 49:15.108
- Good boy. Check out anybody suspicious.
- Right.

49:15.228 --> 49:17.229
Let me go!

49:49.199 --> 49:51.199
It's terrible.

50:06.284 --> 50:08.885
- See anybody?
- No.

50:09.004 --> 50:11.806
I'll call it in.

50:47.936 --> 50:50.537
According to my sources,

50:50.657 --> 50:56.739
Zacharias uses an old fish cannery in San Pedro
to process and move his drugs.

51:04.702 --> 51:06.702
This operation feeds his organization

51:06.822 --> 51:11.463
and depends on shipments of raw cocaine
from South America.

51:11.583 --> 51:15.105
Interrupt this supply
and we can tear out his guts.

51:15.225 --> 51:21.266
The lunch break between 11.30 and 12.00
is a good time to mingle with the workers.

51:21.386 --> 51:25.467
The factory is in two parts.
The first, which is a front,

51:25.587 --> 51:30.068
does, in fact, process fish,
mainly for the pet-food market.

51:30.189 --> 51:32.790
It even makes a profit for Zacharias,

51:32.910 --> 51:36.431
largely employing unskilled labor
on daily hire basis,

51:36.551 --> 51:39.592
so access to this area should be straightforward.

51:39.712 --> 51:43.033
Getting to the second will not be so easy.

52:22.084 --> 52:27.326
Hey! Where do you think you're going?
What section are you in?

52:27.446 --> 52:30.847
- Er... I don't know. Just hired.
- What's your name?

52:30.967 --> 52:33.448
Name is Kimble.

52:57.855 --> 53:00.655
- You finished, Tony?
- You want out?

53:00.775 --> 53:02.777
You got it.

53:27.864 --> 53:32.585
- Hold it. You don't belong here.
- I was told to put this in there.

53:32.705 --> 53:34.906
Your lunch?

54:30.522 --> 54:32.883
Hey! You!

54:33.764 --> 54:36.004
What's going on?

54:57.371 --> 55:02.692
Get that son of a bitch!
A thousand buck s for the man who nails him!

55:02.812 --> 55:05.453
That guy is crazy!

55:06.654 --> 55:10.334
A thousand buck s! Get that son of a bitch now!

57:19.973 --> 57:23.695
Are you crazy?
You're not supposed to come to this house.

57:23.814 --> 57:29.016
It's important.
I think I know who's been giving you trouble.

57:29.136 --> 57:35.858
- Does he work for the Romeros?
- Not as far as I can tell. He also killed Bauggs.

57:38.579 --> 57:42.099
- Then who does he work for?
- I don' t know.

57:42.220 --> 57:47.101
- Find out. When you do, you kill him.
- I don't do that.

57:47.221 --> 57:49.942
You do now.

58:01.545 --> 58:07.307
- I'm leaving now, Mr. Kersey. Goodnight.
- Goodnight. See you in the morning.

58:29.434 --> 58:33.315
- Good evening, Mr. Kersey.
- Sergeant?

58:34.796 --> 58:40.117
- What can I do for you?
- I wanted see how you are doing,

58:40.237 --> 58:45.759
since we didn't have a chance to say hello
the other night at Frank Bauggs' place.

58:52.921 --> 58:58.962
You've made a lot of people unhappy,
Mr. Kersey, especially Ed Zacharias.

58:59.083 --> 59:03.084
He asked me to deliver
his message of distress personally.

59:03.204 --> 59:08.005
- You work for Ed Zacharias?
- Being a cop's too dangerous.

59:08.126 --> 59:11.166
I want to retire early and he pays well.

59:12.607 --> 59:15.848
Now, I don't have to kill you.

59:17.128 --> 59:22.730
I just want to know who you're working for.
I know it's not the Romeros.

59:23.850 --> 59:28.011
- Who is it?
- I don't work for anybody. This is my work.

59:28.132 --> 59:34.613
Don't play games with me.
I can make this scene really painful,

59:34.733 --> 59:37.894
or I can walk out of here.

59:38.014 --> 59:41.735
- All I need is a name.
- I don't have a name.

59:45.537 --> 59:48.938
I can be very nasty if I want to be.

59:56.500 --> 59:59.381
So can I.

01:00:18.346 --> 01:00:23.628
I'm off duty, Higuera, and I'm missing
my beauty sleep, so what's so important?

01:00:23.748 --> 01:00:26.749
A jogger found the body hidden by the trail.

01:00:26.869 --> 01:00:30.150
Aww... another piece of shit in your gang war?

01:00:31.431 --> 01:00:34.192
It's Phil Nozaki.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.273
Phil?

01:00:38.393 --> 01:00:41.633
- How?
- Look s like one shot through the chest.

01:00:42.833 --> 01:00:44.834
I'm sorry.

01:00:58.038 --> 01:01:01.759
So, somehow,
Phil Nozaki figured out who the vigilante is?

01:01:01.879 --> 01:01:07.041
- And the vigilante killed him.
- How did he find out?

01:01:07.161 --> 01:01:11.402
Phil and I were checking out
suspects from the DMV computers.

01:01:11.522 --> 01:01:17.924
When I went through Phil's desk this morning,
I found the list... with one name circled on it.

01:01:20.845 --> 01:01:23.046
Paul Kersey?

01:01:23.166 --> 01:01:29.687
I did some checking. The guy's wife was killed
by burglars in New York in 1975.

01:01:30.968 --> 01:01:35.970
Then, in 1981,
his daughter was raped and murdered in LA.

01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:42.211
I think Kersey's our man. I want a warrant.

01:01:43.011 --> 01:01:48.093
I don't know. It's very little to go on.
We'd have trouble convincing a judge.

01:01:49.894 --> 01:01:53.255
Damn it, Higuera, he killed Phil Nozaki.

01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:56.816
I know he did. I want him.

01:01:57.936 --> 01:02:02.818
Nozaki is dead.
I lay you ten to one it was the Romeros.

01:02:02.938 --> 01:02:04.938
No, no.

01:02:05.058 --> 01:02:08.180
- Nozaki said it was somebody else.
- Yeah?

01:02:08.299 --> 01:02:11.180
- Who?
- I don't know.

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:15.862
Somebody's playing us off against each other.

01:02:17.262 --> 01:02:20.583
Hello? Let me talk to Jack. Please.

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:23.864
- Who is it?
- Ed Zacharias.

01:02:27.225 --> 01:02:29.225
Zacharias.

01:02:31.146 --> 01:02:36.548
- Yeah, this is Jack.
- Jack, we need to talk.

01:02:36.668 --> 01:02:41.429
- Yeah? Why?
- I think we're being set up. We'd better meet.

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:44.870
- All right. Where?
- How about Antonio's?

01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:50.151
No, no. You're crazy. You own Antonio's.
It's got to be a neutral territory.

01:02:50.872 --> 01:02:55.953
All right, how about the oilfields...
around five o'clock?

01:02:56.073 --> 01:02:58.074
We'll be there.

01:03:02.836 --> 01:03:04.956
He wants a meeting.

01:03:06.357 --> 01:03:09.717
I don't trust him. I think it's a set-up.

01:03:10.878 --> 01:03:12.878
We'll be prepared.

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:28.021
You wanted to talk. Talk.

01:04:28.141 --> 01:04:32.262
Jack, a lot of things have happened
in the last few days.

01:04:32.382 --> 01:04:36.503
- A bunch of my men have been killed.
- Get to the point.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:40.304
- Someone's playing us against each other.
- What are you talking about?

01:04:40.425 --> 01:04:44.506
- Somebody wants us to go after each other.
- For what?

01:04:44.626 --> 01:04:48.908
- Don't listen to that trash, Jack!
- I'm talking to Jack!

01:04:49.027 --> 01:04:54.428
- It's you! You're trying to screw us over!
- Goddammit, Jack, can't you see?

01:04:54.548 --> 01:04:57.630
- That's what he wants.
- You think we're crazy?

01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:00.951
- Keep messing with us and we'll bury you!
- Tony!

01:05:03.712 --> 01:05:07.152
- Argh!
- Jack! It's a set-up!

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.210
Nick!

01:06:10.771 --> 01:06:12.773
Nick!

01:06:16.734 --> 01:06:18.734
Nick!

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.660
Nick!

01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:13.991
Nick! Nick!

01:08:06.246 --> 01:08:10.247
- Who are you?
- I'm the guy that set you up.

01:08:10.367 --> 01:08:12.368
Why?

01:08:16.849 --> 01:08:19.729
I don't even know the girl.

01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:22.810
I do.

01:08:40.737 --> 01:08:43.857
While you were playing hide-and-seek
with Kersey,

01:08:43.977 --> 01:08:46.898
Zacharias and the Romeros were playing war.

01:08:47.018 --> 01:08:50.779
Come on, does anybody care
if they killed each other?

01:08:50.899 --> 01:08:55.261
- They saved the taxpayer some money.
- Kersey's lawyer called the chief.

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:59.381
- He's threatening to sue.
- He's trying to get us to back off.

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:04.542
- I'm telling you, Kersey's our man.
- You took your shot and you blew it.

01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:08.064
Now, stay away from Kersey. That's an order.

01:09:12.826 --> 01:09:16.346
I've been reading about the job you did.
Congratulations.

01:09:16.466 --> 01:09:20.828
Zacharias and the Romeros
won't kill kids with their drugs any more.

01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:24.948
Thank God. There's something
I would like to talk about.

01:09:25.069 --> 01:09:28.630
Can we meet at the Brentwood Golf Course
about eight?

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:31.312
I'll be there.

01:10:07.763 --> 01:10:10.763
- Where's White?
- I'll take you to him.

01:10:10.883 --> 01:10:15.685
- He said he'd meet me here.
- He had business to take care of.

01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:38.411
Hey!

01:10:42.813 --> 01:10:44.813
Hey!

01:11:57.915 --> 01:12:00.916
How did you get in? This is private property.

01:12:01.036 --> 01:12:04.637
- I want to see Nathan White.
- He is not available.

01:12:04.757 --> 01:12:07.358
He is to me.

01:12:12.639 --> 01:12:16.041
- Sir, he has a gun.
- What's the meaning of this?

01:12:16.161 --> 01:12:20.842
- I wanted to see Nathan White.
- I am Nathan White. Who are you?

01:12:21.643 --> 01:12:25.484
- You? You're Nathan White?
- I ought to know my own name.

01:12:25.604 --> 01:12:31.366
- Who was the man that was here last week?
- No one. I've been in Europe for three months.

01:13:02.615 --> 01:13:05.216
Get out of the car.

01:13:10.017 --> 01:13:15.018
- What did I do? Why did you stop me?
- Well, well, well...

01:13:17.939 --> 01:13:20.540
- You're under arrest.
- What for?

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:23.661
- Murder.
- Who am I supposed to have killed?

01:13:23.781 --> 01:13:27.782
A homicide detective downtown
will explain that to you. Let's go.

01:13:27.902 --> 01:13:30.783
Come on, in the car.

01:13:30.903 --> 01:13:33.584
In the car! Back!

01:13:49.469 --> 01:13:53.470
Hey, if you're taking me downtown,
why are we going west?

01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:56.390
Why don't you just shut up?

01:13:59.472 --> 01:14:05.473
Don't I know you
from the Sunset Police Station?

01:14:05.593 --> 01:14:07.594
Could be.

01:14:09.755 --> 01:14:12.356
That's what I thought.

01:14:14.916 --> 01:14:20.518
- What the? Shoot the son of a bitch!
- OK, that's enough! Freeze right there!

01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:13.951
Are you fucking deaf? I said everything's great.
We should have the whole operation sewed up.

01:16:14.071 --> 01:16:19.753
Zacharias's dealers are ready to work for us.
Romero boys won't, but we'll push them in line.

01:16:19.873 --> 01:16:25.755
We want our first shipment in a couple of days.
I'll talk to you then. Goodbye.

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:32.837
- How did you let Kersey get away?
- We made a mistake.

01:16:32.958 --> 01:16:37.279
Mistake? Go on, get out of here! Go on!
Get out of here!

01:16:38.199 --> 01:16:41.600
- Asshole!
- Something wrong?

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:47.562
- Yeah. Kersey's still alive. That's what's wrong.
- So what? He doesn't know anything.

01:16:47.682 --> 01:16:51.363
- He could put the cops onto us.
- You worry too much.

01:16:52.083 --> 01:16:57.124
Look, stupid, your boss is dead and I'm alive
because I'm smarter than he was.

01:16:57.244 --> 01:17:00.326
That's why you came to work for me.

01:17:00.846 --> 01:17:05.848
- As long as Kersey's breathing he's dangerous.
- What do you want me to do?

01:17:08.688 --> 01:17:12.529
We need an edge.
Something to make Kersey come to us.

01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:17.611
Karen Sheldon.

01:17:17.731 --> 01:17:21.732
This is Jesse.
I've got some information you'll be interested in.

01:17:21.852 --> 01:17:25.973
- About that shoot-out at the oilfield last night.
- What about it?

01:17:26.093 --> 01:17:33.376
- Who do you think I am? This will cost you.
- It better be worth it. Where should I meet you?

01:17:34.856 --> 01:17:39.818
I'm in the parking lot behind your office.
Look for the red Mazda RX-7.

01:18:34.434 --> 01:18:36.434
Hello, Kersey.

01:18:38.275 --> 01:18:41.235
Put your hands up.

01:18:41.356 --> 01:18:43.356
Real high.

01:18:44.796 --> 01:18:46.797
Come over here.

01:18:50.318 --> 01:18:52.359
Turn around.

01:19:07.203 --> 01:19:10.204
You killed a cop, Kersey.

01:19:10.324 --> 01:19:13.525
Not just any cop, my partner.

01:19:15.085 --> 01:19:18.646
- Now I'm going to kill you.
- Your partner was dirty.

01:19:18.767 --> 01:19:21.488
- Bullshit.
- He worked for Ed Zacharias.

01:19:21.608 --> 01:19:24.048
You're lying!

01:19:27.209 --> 01:19:30.210
- He was going to kill me.
- Why?

01:19:32.971 --> 01:19:37.533
He knew I was setting up Zacharias
and the Romeros to kill each other.

01:19:40.053 --> 01:19:45.015
- You engineered that whole thing at the oilfield?
- Yes. I'm the vigilante, remember.

01:19:45.135 --> 01:19:49.737
When your partner found out,
he told Zacharias, who told him to kill me.

01:19:51.337 --> 01:19:54.057
I don't believe one word you're saying.

01:19:54.177 --> 01:19:58.739
- Phil Nozaki was a good cop.
- Check his safety deposit box.

01:19:58.859 --> 01:20:02.260
- You'll find a lot of cash.
- You're a liar!

01:20:05.741 --> 01:20:11.623
Hi. This is Paul.
Leave a message and I'll get back to you.

01:20:12.423 --> 01:20:17.304
Hello, Kersey.
A friend of yours wants to say hello.

01:20:17.424 --> 01:20:22.746
Paul? They say they won't hurt me
if you do what they say.

01:20:24.346 --> 01:20:28.827
Paul, I'm scared. I'm so scared!

01:20:28.947 --> 01:20:32.349
Do you want her
to end up dead like Erica?

01:20:32.469 --> 01:20:38.150
Yes, I was responsible.
You'd better join us at the Sunset roller rink

01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:41.991
- underground garage, Area 16.
- Let me pick it up.

01:20:42.111 --> 01:20:46.153
- Don't you move.
- You've got nice taste in women, Kersey.

01:20:46.273 --> 01:20:49.754
- Very nice taste.
- The hell with you.

01:20:50.514 --> 01:20:52.995
- Hello?
- Put down that phone!

01:20:53.115 --> 01:20:55.596
Hello?

01:23:09.955 --> 01:23:12.637
- What's he doing?
- Nothing, just sitting.

01:23:15.678 --> 01:23:17.038
Flash.

01:23:33.683 --> 01:23:35.924
Here he comes.

01:23:45.007 --> 01:23:47.007
Take him.

01:24:24.458 --> 01:24:27.379
He's not here. It's empty.

01:24:39.422 --> 01:24:42.824
- Holy shit...
- Fuck this mess!

01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:46.065
You fucking black fag!

01:25:00.309 --> 01:25:03.029
Jesus Christ!

01:25:51.404 --> 01:25:54.685
- Alert everyone. Where's the girl?
- In the power room.

01:25:54.805 --> 01:25:58.006
Cover the garage exit. Key. Cover the fire exit.

01:26:12.451 --> 01:26:16.611
Be on the alert for Kersey.
Be on the alert for Kersey.

01:26:16.731 --> 01:26:21.453
- He jumped us. Cover the garage exit.
- I'm heading there now.

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:08.667
Leave the building immediately.
Do not jam the fire exits.

01:27:11.508 --> 01:27:13.988
What the hell is this?

01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:20.911
Let me outta here!

01:27:37.796 --> 01:27:41.317
We're going out the back.
Not one word from you.

01:27:41.437 --> 01:27:45.318
After I waste Kersey, maybe I'll let you go.
Let's go.

01:27:47.718 --> 01:27:50.680
Out of my way!

01:28:23.970 --> 01:28:29.691
- Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
- Get out of the way!

01:28:51.618 --> 01:28:53.618
Kersey!

01:28:54.659 --> 01:28:57.660
I know you're there!

01:29:04.181 --> 01:29:07.622
I'm warning you! Keep away!

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:10.343
Do you hear me?

01:29:12.624 --> 01:29:16.986
Back up! I'll kill her! I said stay back!

01:29:18.466 --> 01:29:22.106
I'll blow her brains out!

01:29:22.227 --> 01:29:27.468
I swear to God! I'll kill this bitch!
Do you hear me?

01:29:33.471 --> 01:29:36.191
You work for me!

01:29:36.311 --> 01:29:39.272
I gave you all that information!

No!
