00:05.840 --> 00:10.520
Donna, you're so sweet for letting
Jackie live here with you while her mom is-

00:10.560 --> 00:13.720
- You know.
- Whoring around Mexico?

00:13.800 --> 00:16.160
Donna, that is not fair.

00:16.239 --> 00:18.840
I think she left Mexico.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.040
Well, you know, Jackie
and I might have fun.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.160
- Sort of like a... slumber party.
- Mm-hmm.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.920
Yes, late-night girl talk...

00:28.000 --> 00:30.160
hot oil massages...

00:30.240 --> 00:33.600
and the furtive whispers of,
"We shouldn't!"

00:35.040 --> 00:38.800
And then, "Shh! It's okay!"

00:45.000 --> 00:49.120
- Is that all you're bringing?
- Oh, um, just a couple more small things.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.560
- Out of the way, Jackie.
- Comin' through!

00:51.640 --> 00:54.040
Got a buttload!

00:54.120 --> 00:56.440
Heavy. Can't...
feel... my fingers!

00:56.480 --> 01:00.080
- Yup!
- Ooh.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.200
Jackie's panties!
Hey, Hyde.

01:03.280 --> 01:07.800
If these babies could talk, I bet they could
tell some pretty good stories about me!

01:07.840 --> 01:11.200
Yeah, I bet they'd have
a French accent too.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.120
My girlfriend's panties, Kelso? Is that
really a road you want to go down with me?

01:17.920 --> 01:21.600
What's that, panties?

01:21.680 --> 01:24.440
[Chuckling]
Oh, no! I can't tell Hyde that one!

01:24.480 --> 01:26.920
Naughty panties!

01:29.880 --> 01:32.560
What's that, fist?
It would be my pleasure.

One general-issue military cot...

01:44.800 --> 01:48.120
slightly used from my days
in the National Guard.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.920
Well, it's good to know that the
National Guard was gettin' a good night's sleep...

01:52.000 --> 01:56.360
while I was in the South Pacific
dodgin' bullets and using coral as toilet paper!

01:58.720 --> 02:01.840
So- [Sighs] I don't think there's
gonna be room for everything.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.720
Oh, Donna, sure there will.
I only brought the stuff I absolutely needed.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.000
All right.
Where goes the horse?

02:14.240 --> 02:16.600
Guys, if I enroll
in the police academy in the fall...

02:16.640 --> 02:19.160
I could be bustin' heads in a year!

02:20.680 --> 02:22.800
Freeze, dirtbag!

02:25.760 --> 02:29.080
Wow, you did make me freeze.
[Chuckling]

02:29.160 --> 02:33.640
But I was a dirtbag
long before you came along.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.280
Hey. Says here you're supposed
to start getting into shape now.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.360
No, no, that's not for me.
That's for the regular guys.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.960
I haven't done a lap in gym class
since I had my eighth-grade growth spurt...

02:43.040 --> 02:45.800
and Miss Brady made me
her special assistant. [Chuckles]

02:45.880 --> 02:49.040
Guys! Look at this.
I just got another collection letter...

02:49.120 --> 02:51.400
from the jewelry store
about Donna's engagement ring.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.440
- I gotta get some money, or I'm screwed.
- There's a job at the hotel.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.920
My boss would have hired ya.
Then he talked to Red.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.920
I gotta do something.
This is a threatening letter.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.680
"Call us immediately"?

03:03.760 --> 03:05.800
It's-It's in all capital letters.

03:05.880 --> 03:11.520
Look at you.
Another dirtbag dodgin' his responsibilities.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.720
Not on my beat.
Game over, dirtbag!

03:16.840 --> 03:19.880
[Chuckles]
Man, I wish I had some handcuffs.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.240
Here, use mine!

03:29.280 --> 03:31.160

04:10.360 --> 04:12.680
I thought you were gonna
put everything away.

04:12.760 --> 04:16.120
I did. The hardest thing was
finding room for my shoes.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.200
But then I realized I could
just fit them inside your shoes.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.840
Uh-huh.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.640
Look, let's just get some sleep.

See, I wear earplugs so
I can just barely hear it...

04:46.680 --> 04:49.480
but it needs to be loud enough,
because I like the vibration in the bed.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.800
So, how am I supposed
to get to sleep?

04:53.880 --> 04:57.960
Think of something boring.
You know, like school. Or Eric.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.480
Hey.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.400
I sold some of my albums to get some
money for Donna's engagement ring.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.400
Made three bucks.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.120
Which means I am-
Let me see, carry the one, um-

05:23.160 --> 05:25.680
Oh! Still completely screwed.

05:25.720 --> 05:29.280
They wouldn't take

Be nice to Anne, okay?
She's a beloved Canadian songstress.

05:37.080 --> 05:40.720

Well, the worse I feel, the more I need her.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.760
Why do you have money?

05:48.840 --> 05:52.040
What'd you do, mug a Girl Scout?
[Scoffs]

05:52.120 --> 05:54.880
No, I've been selling my albums.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.840
Oh, I hope you didn't sell that
"Froggy Went A-courtin"' record.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.880
You know, when we were
toilet-training Eric...

06:02.960 --> 06:07.280
I'd say, "Does someone
need to go a-courtin'?"

06:08.600 --> 06:11.480

straight off and make a jobby.

that since I paid the allowance...

06:19.480 --> 06:22.560
that bought those records
in the first place, that money's mine.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.640
It occurs to me that possession
is 9/10ths of the law.

06:26.680 --> 06:31.440
Keep up with the smart mouth, and my
foot'll be 9/10ths of the way up your ass.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.800
You know, Forman,
you should write a book:

06:38.880 --> 06:41.680
<i>Things My Father Threatened</i>
<i>To Put In My Ass.</i>

06:43.920 --> 06:46.920

06:48.120 --> 06:50.800

- Ew!
- Donna, don't you knock?

07:03.320 --> 07:05.520

Well,
we're in here, so-

07:09.640 --> 07:12.960
Yeah, well,
I'm in here, so-

07:13.040 --> 07:15.480
Hey, if you want to watch,
I can get into that.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.040
Have a seat on the horse.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.280
- Hey, how was your weekend, Roy?
- Aw, pretty good.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.800
Think I might have met a woman.

07:28.880 --> 07:32.320
- Aw, that's great, man.
- She's stayin' at the hotel.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.520
When I took butter to her table,
she looked right at me and said...

07:35.600 --> 07:38.280
"Took you long enough."

07:38.360 --> 07:40.960
Huh?

07:41.040 --> 07:44.240
- [Dinging]
- All right! Here I am!

07:44.280 --> 07:46.920
Oh, Steven, meet our
new kitchen assistant.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.440
You hired Kelso?

07:51.480 --> 07:54.000
Do you know how many
fires this guy's started?

07:54.080 --> 07:58.600
Three electrical, two chemical,
and one that even surprised me.

08:01.240 --> 08:04.560
Well, I wanted to help him out,
and he said he needed a job.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.560
Yeah, if I'm gonna be a cop,
I gotta quit modelin', I mean-

08:08.640 --> 08:11.480
I can't have the perps lookin'
at pictures of me half-naked.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.920
Oh, and, uh, everywhere I work,
I like to feel at home...

08:15.000 --> 08:17.720
so I brought a little
somethin' ofJackie's.

08:21.520 --> 08:25.400
Okay, uh, I think that's
a health code violation.

08:25.480 --> 08:29.040
But I'm gonna look the other way,
which is hard to do, 'cause-

08:29.120 --> 08:31.160
Look, panties!
[Chuckling]

08:33.080 --> 08:36.559
[Laughing]
Yeah, I burned you with the panties again!

08:38.039 --> 08:41.679
Two days, two locations.
That burn is on tour.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.560
[Sighs] Yeah.
[Clears Throat]

08:46.640 --> 08:49.640
I guess Roy didn't make
things clear, but, um...

08:49.720 --> 08:51.800
all new hires are on probation.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.320
So at the end of the week,
I get to say whether you stay or go.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.560
Yeah, nice try.
[Chuckles]

08:58.640 --> 09:02.400
No, I'm serious, man.
It's all up to me.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.840
So you might want to try
and get on my good side. [Sniffs]

09:10.080 --> 09:12.320
- Oh, uh, excuse me.
- Yes, may I help you?

09:12.400 --> 09:15.080
Oh. Hello, Fez.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.440
Fenton.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.360
- You two know each other?
- I don't want to talk about it.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.640
- There's nothing to say.
- You can say that again.
- Don't tell me what to do.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.040
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Maybe I would!
- Then there's nothing to say!

09:33.080 --> 09:35.960
Yeah.

09:36.040 --> 09:39.040
Um, I have a question
about this letter.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.200
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make a ring payment anytime soon...

09:42.280 --> 09:45.200
so I was wondering if we could
work out some kind of deal.

09:45.240 --> 09:48.360
[Clicks Tongue] Fine. Here's a deal.
Come up with the money by Friday...

09:48.440 --> 09:51.440
or bring the ring back to the store.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.000
What? Bring the ring back?
No, I can't do that.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.280
You can and you will.
No later than 5:00.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.320
I have a party at 8:00.
I need the time to dress.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.000
Eric, you're going to
want to do what he says.

10:04.080 --> 10:08.400
I've been at the other end of Fenton's stick,
and that's not a place you want to be.

10:21.220 --> 10:24.660
<i>And even though, I ain’t got money,
I’m so…</i>

10:25.980 --> 10:27.900
Who am I kidding?

10:27.980 --> 10:32.460
After I can't pay for Donna's ring,
no one's gonna be in love with me, honey.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.580
Must you mock me, Anne Murray?

10:35.660 --> 10:39.180
Kelso, because of your
panty shenanigans...

10:39.220 --> 10:41.140
I'm banning you from the circle.

10:41.220 --> 10:44.020
I hereby ban you!

10:44.100 --> 10:46.340
I also hereby eat your burrito.

10:49.900 --> 10:53.300
Hey, Hyde?
You're not the boss of me!

10:54.460 --> 10:58.220
All right. Well, you can't
tell me what to do.

10:58.260 --> 11:00.340
Shoot.

11:00.420 --> 11:03.060
Well-Well, at least
I'm still my own man.

What do you supposeJackie and Donna

11:12.540 --> 11:14.420
Combing each other's hair?

11:14.460 --> 11:17.900
Applying moisturizer to
their "all-overness"?

11:17.940 --> 11:20.820
Oh, to be a fly in that poop.

11:20.900 --> 11:24.500
All I know is I gotta go tell the woman I love
that the ring I gave her for all eternity...

11:24.580 --> 11:27.660
was actually for only
six-and-a-half weeks.

11:27.740 --> 11:31.460

11:48.020 --> 11:51.260
Jackie used up all our hot water
bathing her dolls.

11:53.420 --> 11:56.660
Normally, I'd rather hose off in
the driveway than ask you for a favor...

11:56.740 --> 12:00.780
but I'm afraid Bob'll want to act out
some car-wash fantasy.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.780
You got me there!
[Laughs]

12:06.860 --> 12:09.140
Come on, Jo-Jo. We can save water
if we soap up together.

12:11.260 --> 12:14.860
And when they're done,
I'm retiling the whole damn bathroom.

12:18.460 --> 12:20.340
Okay, so...

12:20.380 --> 12:24.380
you're absolutely positive that
my hairnet has to be pink?

12:24.460 --> 12:27.020
It's gotta match your apron.

12:32.380 --> 12:35.180
You're pretty.

12:45.780 --> 12:50.620
[Sighs] Jackie, if you're gonna stay here,
we need to set up a few ground rules.

12:50.700 --> 12:52.780
Okay? You can't just-

12:54.260 --> 12:56.660
What happened to
our Led Zeppelin poster?

12:56.740 --> 12:59.660
Oh! I put up
the Captain and Tennille instead.

No, no, no, no.
No way...

is my Led Zeppelin becoming
the Captain and Tennille.

13:07.780 --> 13:10.820
[Chuckles] Led Zeppelin wishes
they could be the Captain and Tennille.

13:13.540 --> 13:16.220
What did you say?

13:16.300 --> 13:20.260
Hey, Donna. Um, I need to
talk to you for a second.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.820

- Um...

13:24.860 --> 13:28.620
I have been thinking
all day-

[Sighs]
About your eyes.

13:30.660 --> 13:33.180
[Chuckles]
What?

13:33.260 --> 13:38.220
Yeah, your eyes. They're so beautiful
and shiny. You now what else is shiny?

13:38.300 --> 13:41.420
This diamond ring, which has to go
back to the store because it isn't paid for.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.060
Because you can put a price tag
on a ring, but, you know...

13:44.140 --> 13:46.700
who can put a price tag on your eyes?
[Chuckles]

13:48.260 --> 13:51.700
Only God, that's who.

13:51.780 --> 13:55.300
- You're taking back my ring?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

13:55.380 --> 13:57.220

I mean, I can't make the payments.

14:05.620 --> 14:07.860

[Chuckles] As long as we have that,
I don't need a silly ring.

14:18.460 --> 14:20.620
Um, Donna...

14:20.660 --> 14:22.740
you didn't give me the ring.

Yeah, I- I thought
you'd think I did.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.380
[Laughs]
All right.

14:35.740 --> 14:38.140
Donna, I promise.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.860
- I'm gonna make this up to you.
- 'Kay.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.540
[Sighs]
Um, Donna, you gave me a quarter.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.940
Mmm, fine.

14:53.460 --> 14:57.060
Hello, Mr. Forman.
And <i>you.</i>

14:57.140 --> 15:00.220
- Shut your filthy mouth!
- [Gasps]

15:02.420 --> 15:05.180
Look, here it is.
Here's the ring back.

15:05.260 --> 15:08.020
- Oh, honey, that's paid for.
- What?

15:08.100 --> 15:10.500
Someone came in and paid
through the end of next month.

15:10.580 --> 15:14.300
I'm not supposed to say who,
but she sure was a pretty little number.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.260
I guess.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.380
You know what?
It was Donna.

15:23.460 --> 15:25.860
I can't believe she'd go
behind my back like this!

15:25.940 --> 15:28.060
I cannot believe that this man
would go behind my back...

15:28.140 --> 15:30.220
and take what was given
to me by God himself.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.180
All right. What happened
between you two anyway?

15:36.260 --> 15:39.020
I'm too much of a man to say.

15:39.060 --> 15:41.060
But it involved a half-off sale...

15:41.140 --> 15:45.420
a crowded parking lot, and a pair of pants
to make my ass look like an oil painting.

15:48.540 --> 15:51.460
If you mean, "old and cracked,"
then I agree!

15:53.780 --> 15:56.420
- I'll see you in hell!
- Well, I'll be wearing your pants!

16:00.940 --> 16:03.220
Okay, I'm feeling a little
"in the way" here...

16:03.300 --> 16:06.580
so- I'm ju- I'm-
[Clears Throat]

16:11.060 --> 16:14.060
Oh, Roy. Hey, how's it goin'
with that hotel chick...

16:14.140 --> 16:17.500
that was <i>all over you,</i>
asking for butter?

16:17.580 --> 16:21.220
[Chuckles] Well, I had this idea
to surprise her with flowers?

16:21.300 --> 16:24.780
But when I did, she started
screamin' and hittin' me.

16:24.860 --> 16:28.300
And I guess the lesson is,
don't hide in someone's shower.

16:28.340 --> 16:30.740
I don't know what's
wrong with chicks, man.

16:30.820 --> 16:33.740
If I came home and some strange girl
was in <i>my</i> shower...

16:33.820 --> 16:36.180
that would be
the greatest day of my life!

16:36.260 --> 16:38.660
Yeah!

16:38.740 --> 16:42.180
- So, w-what are you doin'?
- Oh, Hyde's makin' me do his laundry.

16:42.260 --> 16:45.820
Then after this, I gotta clean out
the toilets and hand-test all the mousetraps.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.340
This probation period is killin' me.

16:49.420 --> 16:52.540
Did Hyde tell you there
was a probation period?

16:52.620 --> 16:54.460
Aw, man!

16:54.540 --> 16:57.020
That guy really knows
how to enjoy life!

16:59.220 --> 17:01.540
Wait. You mean, Hyde's
just messin' with me?

17:01.620 --> 17:04.700
- I don't have to worry about gettin' fired?
- If I didn't get fired...

17:04.780 --> 17:08.859
for hidin' in some woman's shower,
I think your job's secure.

17:10.740 --> 17:15.020
[Sighs] Hey, guys. Kelso, be careful, huh?
Some of those T-shirts are delicate.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.460
Oh, I'm- I'm sorry, man.
I'll be extra careful.

17:17.540 --> 17:20.500
I wouldn't want to do anything
to screw up my probation period!

17:20.579 --> 17:23.260
[Laughing]

17:24.460 --> 17:26.500
Hey! I wanna play! Ah!

17:26.579 --> 17:29.260
Come on, buddy.
Somebody spray me.

17:29.300 --> 17:33.740
Hey, Hyde. Maybe you could
use these to dry off with.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.740
[Laughs]

17:43.220 --> 17:45.780
Probation period!
[Laughing]

17:48.700 --> 17:51.460
Jackie read my diary, Mrs. Forman.

17:51.540 --> 17:54.060
And she even wrote
little comments inside.

17:54.100 --> 17:58.460
Yeah. Like, "Oh!
This could never happen."

17:58.540 --> 18:01.460
And-And, "Donna, that guy
was whistling at me, not you."

18:03.100 --> 18:05.820
I can't take it anymore!
I'm kicking her out.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.820
But, Donna, the poor girl
has nowhere to stay.

18:08.900 --> 18:11.700
She can't stay here!

18:11.780 --> 18:14.580
She can't stay anywhere near here.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.780
Bob was in our shower again.

18:16.860 --> 18:19.740
This morning, I pulled something
out of our drain...

18:19.820 --> 18:23.140
that I could not <i>believe</i>
came off a human body.

18:26.140 --> 18:30.060
Oh! Donna. There you are. Okay, look.
We have to talk about your makeup collection.

18:30.140 --> 18:33.420
ChapStick is not lipstick.

18:33.460 --> 18:37.900
Jackie, sit down. Look. We need to talk
about you and me living together.

18:37.980 --> 18:39.860
- Donna!
- Because it's just-

18:39.900 --> 18:44.140
I just came from the jewelry store.
You can't pay for your own engagement ring!

18:44.180 --> 18:47.020
This ring is from me to you,
not from me to you, paid for by you.

18:47.060 --> 18:49.580
That's like cutting off
my bal-

18:55.220 --> 18:58.060
...lerina shoes.

18:58.100 --> 19:02.500
- I didn't pay for the ring.
- Fenton at the jewelry store
said a pretty little number-

19:02.580 --> 19:07.780
Oh, my God. Mom?
You're the pretty little number.

19:07.860 --> 19:10.660
[Laughing]

19:14.300 --> 19:17.420
Well, I- I do like hearing that...

19:17.500 --> 19:20.140
once in a while.

19:21.820 --> 19:26.060
- But i-i-it wasn't me.
- Well, I don't know, Dad...

19:26.100 --> 19:30.540
some men might consider you-

19:30.620 --> 19:35.340
- You just can't stop talkin', can you?
- Eric, I paid for the ring.

19:35.380 --> 19:36.820
- What?
- What?

19:36.900 --> 19:38.820
Look, Donna, I read in your diary...

19:38.900 --> 19:42.020
that you think I'm kind of
hard to live with, and...

19:44.420 --> 19:46.340
well, I realized you were right.

19:46.420 --> 19:49.980
And I wanted to show you
that I know, and I'm sorry.

19:50.060 --> 19:53.860
- And, well, thank you.
- Huh.

19:53.940 --> 19:58.580
Well, gosh, Jackie,
how very sweet, and...

19:58.660 --> 20:01.580
uncharacteristic of you.

20:01.620 --> 20:04.260
Well, I know how much
you love that ring...

20:04.340 --> 20:07.020
and I wanted to do something nice.

20:07.060 --> 20:09.500
- Wow, thanks.
- [Chuckles]

20:09.580 --> 20:12.740
You know, Jackie, some people,
if they want to be nice...

20:12.820 --> 20:17.860
they just actually start being nicer
on a day-to-day basis.

20:19.540 --> 20:21.940
Yeah, I figured it'd be
easier to write a check.

20:28.660 --> 20:31.140
- Jackie! Jackie!
- Hmm?

20:31.180 --> 20:33.540
I heard something underneath my bed.

20:36.860 --> 20:40.500
- Fez?
- [Imitating Cat] Meow!

20:40.580 --> 20:42.660
Fez, the cat's outside.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.620
[Imitating Dog]
Woof, woof?

20:49.700 --> 20:52.140
Please, let me stay.
I promise I won't make a sound.

20:52.220 --> 20:54.420
Well, I do make some sounds,
but they're happy sounds!
