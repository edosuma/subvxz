WEBVTT

00:00.642 --> 00:03.544
The Carmichael Show is taped
in front a live studio audience.

00:03.545 --> 00:05.835
All I'm saying is I, for one,

00:05.836 --> 00:08.805
am gonna be kind of sad to
see the Confederate flag go.

00:08.806 --> 00:10.407
You know...

00:10.408 --> 00:13.009
that flag is a symbol of racism!

00:13.010 --> 00:14.444
I know. That's why we need it.

00:14.445 --> 00:16.913
It lets you know how people are
without them having to tell you.

00:16.914 --> 00:19.082
Okay? 'Cause the only
thing worse than racism

00:19.083 --> 00:21.618
is surprise racism.

00:21.619 --> 00:22.786
I don't know.

00:22.787 --> 00:24.454
You weren't around when I was growing up.

00:24.455 --> 00:27.824
"In your face" racism is pretty bad, too.

00:27.825 --> 00:29.426
Yeah, I'm with Joe. Back in school,

00:29.427 --> 00:31.461
I got called names 'cause I'm biracial.

00:31.462 --> 00:35.197
I had to eat my Oreos in the bathroom.

00:36.233 --> 00:38.635
I would rather for, like,
a diner in South Carolina

00:38.636 --> 00:40.337
to have the Confederate flag in the window,

00:40.338 --> 00:43.607
so I know not to go in there,
than them not having the flag up

00:43.608 --> 00:45.709
and then I walk in and get my pie spat at.

00:45.710 --> 00:48.345
I'm sorry, I'm still thinking about Maxine

00:48.346 --> 00:51.346
eating them Oreos in the bathroom!

00:52.983 --> 00:54.718
Jerrod, before you forget,

00:54.719 --> 00:56.820
tomorrow starts the church's annual

00:56.821 --> 00:59.022
Big Brother/Big Sister program.

00:59.023 --> 01:02.826
I'll get your information packets, okay?

01:02.827 --> 01:05.527
I know how much food I
have on my plate, Joe.

01:09.499 --> 01:11.101
Yeah, I didn't know that
you did that program.

01:11.102 --> 01:12.135
I'm so proud of you.

01:12.136 --> 01:14.137
I'm no hero, Maxine.

01:14.138 --> 01:16.072
I didn't say you were a hero.

01:16.073 --> 01:19.142
I said I was proud.

01:19.143 --> 01:21.845
Every year, my mom has us
do, like, a service project

01:21.846 --> 01:23.079
with the church.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.648
We used to do, like, Habitat for Humanity,

01:24.649 --> 01:25.982
but then I stopped 'cause we started

01:25.983 --> 01:28.350
building houses that were nicer than ours.

01:29.452 --> 01:31.588
But the Big Brother program's
gonna be fun, you know?

01:31.589 --> 01:33.556
These kids aren't used
to having anybody around,

01:33.557 --> 01:35.892
so they have to bounce a ball off a wall.

01:35.893 --> 01:38.895
So all I got to do is
be more fun than a wall.

01:38.896 --> 01:40.797
See, I don't know, Jerrod.

01:40.798 --> 01:43.065
Those rock-climbing walls are pretty fun.

01:43.833 --> 01:45.302
If we get the right kid,

01:45.303 --> 01:47.704
we'll wind up like Sandra
Bullock in The Blind Side.

01:47.705 --> 01:48.738
What do you mean?

01:48.739 --> 01:49.973
Look, if you get a kid

01:49.974 --> 01:52.175
that winds up being a pro ballplayer,

01:52.176 --> 01:55.812
then he's gonna remember what
a great Big Brother you were

01:55.813 --> 01:59.148
and he's gonna hook us up
with tickets and jerseys.

02:00.517 --> 02:02.951
Not being greedy... maybe even a new house!

02:04.321 --> 02:07.489
Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Jackson.

02:10.526 --> 02:12.562
Aw, Nekeisha!

02:12.563 --> 02:14.965
Robert Glorephen Carmichael.

02:14.966 --> 02:17.300
"Glorephen"?

02:17.301 --> 02:19.369
It's a combination of my Aunt Gloria

02:19.370 --> 02:21.603
and my Uncle Stephen.

02:23.406 --> 02:24.808
Here are our final divorce papers.

02:24.809 --> 02:27.377
Now, just sign those, and
our divorce is official.

02:27.378 --> 02:28.778
What are you talking
about? I thought our divorce

02:28.779 --> 02:30.080
was official when you started

02:30.081 --> 02:31.514
sleeping with Lamont and
stopped sleeping with me!

02:31.515 --> 02:33.416
In the eyes of the state, no.

02:33.417 --> 02:35.551
But in my eyes, hell yes!

02:36.953 --> 02:39.656
So please sign these
papers so we can move on.

02:39.657 --> 02:41.591
Also, I need you to give me a ride home.

02:41.592 --> 02:43.059
I got to do some texting.

02:43.060 --> 02:45.095
Well, fine.

02:45.096 --> 02:46.696
Only because me and Lamont made plans

02:46.697 --> 02:49.666
to catch up on Ballers tonight.

02:49.667 --> 02:52.302
Here's the kid we matched you up with.

02:52.303 --> 02:54.104
Wait a minute.

02:54.105 --> 02:56.106
Let's make a wish that inside this envelope

02:56.107 --> 02:58.108
is the next LeBron or Kobe.

02:58.109 --> 02:59.275
No, no.

02:59.276 --> 03:00.243
No, Dad.

03:00.244 --> 03:02.012
All I want is a nice, easy kid

03:02.013 --> 03:04.481
who's troubled enough to make
me look like a good person,

03:04.482 --> 03:06.116
but not so troubled that I'm worried

03:06.117 --> 03:07.751
my apartment's gonna get robbed.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.719
You got to think bigger.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.988
Now, visualize with me.

03:11.989 --> 03:14.657
A limousine pulls up to an NBA arena.

03:14.658 --> 03:15.825
Who gets out?

03:15.826 --> 03:18.193
Why, it's Joe and Jerrod Carmichael.

03:19.429 --> 03:21.231
We're led down the stairs
past some famous people.

03:21.232 --> 03:22.532
They don't really like basketball.

03:22.533 --> 03:23.700
They just want to be seen.

03:23.701 --> 03:24.801
Hey, Biebs!

03:24.802 --> 03:26.302
How you doing, Heather Locklears?

03:26.303 --> 03:30.073
All of a sudden, a player on
the court stops stretching.

03:30.074 --> 03:32.575
He spies us and smiles and waves.

03:32.576 --> 03:34.744
And that player's name is...

03:36.147 --> 03:37.614
Jordan Chamberlain.

03:37.615 --> 03:38.882
Jordan Chamberlain?!

03:38.883 --> 03:42.018
He already has a Hall of Fame name!

03:42.019 --> 03:45.422
Tell me you're not excited
about this right now.

03:45.423 --> 03:47.090
This kid might be, like, a math whiz

03:47.091 --> 03:49.826
or, like, a musical prodigy
or maybe, I don't know,

03:49.827 --> 03:51.795
the son of, like, a convicted bank robber

03:51.796 --> 03:53.363
who's trying to get her life together

03:53.364 --> 03:55.065
and needs a better role model for her kid.

03:55.066 --> 03:57.467
Wait a minute, let me look at that.

03:57.468 --> 03:58.868
Peanut allergy,

03:58.869 --> 04:01.304
favorite movie Jack and Jill...

04:01.305 --> 04:04.707
all-city youth basketball!

04:04.708 --> 04:06.776
Okay, well,

04:06.777 --> 04:09.112
although I'm doing this for the community,

04:09.113 --> 04:11.414
if Jordan Chamberlain
someday stands up at a podium

04:11.415 --> 04:16.052
and looks at me and says
that I'm the real MVP...

04:16.053 --> 04:18.021
who am I to argue?

04:18.022 --> 04:20.290
Courtside seats!

04:20.291 --> 04:22.692
Courtside seats!

04:22.693 --> 04:26.528
I had eight beans on my plate, Joe!

04:28.000 --> 04:34.074

04:44.261 --> 04:46.796
Jordan, you are amazing at basketball, man.

04:46.797 --> 04:48.860
I got to tell you, I've
never been dunked on before.

04:48.861 --> 04:51.567
I'm surprised 'cause...

04:51.568 --> 04:53.502
you're terrible.

04:53.503 --> 04:55.559
Well, look,

04:55.560 --> 04:57.895
I'm trying to break
racial stereotypes here.

04:57.896 --> 05:01.031
All right, well, since
you're not good at sports,

05:01.032 --> 05:02.665
maybe you're smart, so...

05:04.401 --> 05:06.303
Can you help me with this algebra?

05:06.304 --> 05:07.538
Help you with your algebra?

05:07.539 --> 05:09.039
Yeah, I can help you with your algebra.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.774
Look.

05:10.775 --> 05:13.444
Most of what they teach
us in school is pointless.

05:13.445 --> 05:15.312
This is what you really need
to know to get through life.

05:15.313 --> 05:17.381
You got to be really good at one thing.

05:17.382 --> 05:19.350
Now, for you, that thing is basketball.

05:19.351 --> 05:20.684
What is it for you?

05:20.685 --> 05:22.119
Personality.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.854
I'm all personality, my man.

05:23.855 --> 05:26.824
I won class president over
a much more qualified kid,

05:26.825 --> 05:28.225
and it's all because of this charm.

05:28.226 --> 05:30.459
Look at this charm. Look, look, watch this.

05:31.428 --> 05:32.563
You see that?

05:32.564 --> 05:33.864
You want to vote for me, right?

05:33.865 --> 05:35.766
If you could vote, you would vote for me.

05:35.767 --> 05:37.768
Um, hi, you must be Jordan.

05:37.769 --> 05:39.503
I'm-I'm Maxine.

05:39.504 --> 05:41.070
Hi.

05:42.439 --> 05:45.042
Um, I baked you this plate of cookies.

05:45.043 --> 05:47.177
Well, not the plate, of course.
That was made in a factory.

05:47.178 --> 05:48.412
Probably in a kiln.

05:48.413 --> 05:49.580
That's a funny word, isn't it?

05:49.581 --> 05:50.647
- Kiln?
- Okay.

05:50.648 --> 05:51.915
All right. Hey, hey.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.484
Jordan, I'm gonna go talk to my girlfriend.

05:53.485 --> 05:55.052
Enjoy a cookie, man, all right?

05:55.053 --> 05:57.354
We'll be right back. Right, right back.

05:57.355 --> 05:59.423
Hey? Jordan?

05:59.424 --> 06:00.858
Please don't rob me.

06:00.859 --> 06:02.993
You're not gonna rob me.
Don't, just, but don't.

06:02.994 --> 06:05.229
But don't rob me, okay?

06:05.230 --> 06:07.364
Maxine, what is wrong with you?

06:07.365 --> 06:08.799
I'm sorry. I know, I know.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.300
I just...

06:10.301 --> 06:12.001
I have a condition.

06:12.970 --> 06:15.139
I'm pedophobic.

06:15.140 --> 06:16.940
What?!

06:16.941 --> 06:19.475
How did I not know about this?

06:20.811 --> 06:22.579
Don't you have to register with the state?

06:22.580 --> 06:24.413
How did you get in this neighborhood?

06:25.149 --> 06:27.418
No... not a pedophile!

06:27.419 --> 06:28.619
I'm-I'm pedophobic.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.587
It means I have an
irrational fear of children.

06:30.588 --> 06:32.256
Oh.

06:32.257 --> 06:34.591
God!

06:34.592 --> 06:36.727
Those... those words

06:36.728 --> 06:39.663
are too close to mean
completely different things.

06:39.664 --> 06:41.031
Oh.

06:41.032 --> 06:42.766
It started when I was 16

06:42.767 --> 06:45.135
and I was on a flight
from New York to London.

06:45.136 --> 06:47.237
While I was on the flight, I
was sitting next to this woman,

06:47.238 --> 06:48.539
and she asked me if I would

06:48.540 --> 06:50.407
hold her baby while she
went to the bathroom.

06:50.408 --> 06:52.643
And at first, I was... I was doing great.

06:52.644 --> 06:53.844
Let me show you.

06:53.845 --> 06:55.913
So, I...

06:55.914 --> 06:57.080
I don't know what happened.

06:57.081 --> 06:59.016
All of a sudden, the baby...

06:59.017 --> 07:00.684
slipped out of my hands,

07:00.685 --> 07:03.754
rolled down my legs,

07:03.755 --> 07:06.489
and I caught it with my feet like this.

07:08.692 --> 07:10.559
And then I sneezed.

07:13.397 --> 07:15.466
And it was awful. She screamed at me,

07:15.467 --> 07:17.167
and I was judged by the whole plane

07:17.168 --> 07:18.836
across the entire Atlantic Ocean.

07:18.837 --> 07:20.804
Oh, wow, that's okay.

07:20.805 --> 07:22.806
Hey, Maxine,

07:22.807 --> 07:26.343
if I could afford to go
to London when I was 16,

07:26.344 --> 07:29.480
I'd probably spike a baby, too.

07:30.448 --> 07:33.050
Diddy, watch out! It's a trap door!

07:33.051 --> 07:35.252
It's amazing how you just organized

07:35.253 --> 07:38.021
all these celebrities falling
into one video like this.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.957
Jerrod, you know, I feel
like you get me, like...

07:39.958 --> 07:41.225
It's 'cause I do, man.

07:41.226 --> 07:42.960
I was just like you when I was your age,

07:42.961 --> 07:45.162
except way worse at basketball.

07:45.163 --> 07:47.731
Look, man, I'm gonna be honest.

07:47.732 --> 07:50.501
I wasn't expecting much out of
you when I signed up for this.

07:50.502 --> 07:53.536
I really wasn't expecting
much out of you either, so...

07:59.109 --> 08:00.978
Thank you.

08:00.979 --> 08:02.412
But...

08:02.413 --> 08:04.381
Well, look, let me give you
a little Big Brother advice,

08:04.382 --> 08:05.616
so you don't mess anything up.

08:05.617 --> 08:07.818
Now, what's the one thing

08:07.819 --> 08:10.487
that usually ruins any NBA player's career?

08:10.488 --> 08:12.888
Trying to rap.

08:14.591 --> 08:17.961
Yeah, that hurt Kobe pretty bad.

08:17.962 --> 08:19.329
But no, no, no.

08:19.330 --> 08:20.597
I'm talking about women.

08:20.598 --> 08:21.899
What's wrong with women?

08:21.900 --> 08:24.001
Well, look, I don't want you
falling into that trap, man.

08:24.002 --> 08:25.168
Like, I don't want you

08:25.169 --> 08:27.137
to get married at age 20, you know,

08:27.138 --> 08:28.972
because you think you're in love.

08:28.973 --> 08:30.541
And you think it's gonna last forever.

08:30.542 --> 08:31.842
'Cause it's not, you know?

08:31.843 --> 08:33.577
You'll be a millionaire
professional athlete,

08:33.578 --> 08:36.078
and you're gonna cheat on her, right?

08:38.181 --> 08:39.716
And you should because God blessed you

08:39.717 --> 08:41.985
with this amazing talent
that attracts beautiful women

08:41.986 --> 08:43.453
and he doesn't want you squandering that

08:43.453 --> 08:45.522
on something silly like a wife and kids.

08:45.523 --> 08:47.357
That's...

08:47.358 --> 08:50.193
I appreciate you looking out
for my future, Jerrod, but...

08:50.194 --> 08:52.195
I don't think I'll have
any problems with women.

08:52.196 --> 08:54.031
Now, what makes you so
sure you're not gonna

08:54.032 --> 08:56.433
fall into the same trap
that so many other athletes

08:56.434 --> 08:58.100
before you have fallen into?

08:59.102 --> 09:00.936
He's gay!

09:02.973 --> 09:04.007
You're gay?

09:04.008 --> 09:06.276
I knew it.

09:06.277 --> 09:07.511
No, Jordan's gay.

09:07.512 --> 09:09.246
How do you get "I'm gay" out of "He's gay"?

09:09.247 --> 09:11.782
I'm old. My ears hear what I
already been thinking anyway,

09:11.783 --> 09:13.382
so I don't have to listen.

09:14.451 --> 09:16.553
Jordan can't be gay... I saw a video of him

09:16.554 --> 09:18.655
playing basketball on that school Web site.

09:18.656 --> 09:21.158
He moves just like a straight.

09:21.159 --> 09:25.062
First of all, gay people
don't move a certain way.

09:25.063 --> 09:29.232
And secondly, please stay
off middle school Web sites.

09:29.233 --> 09:31.201
I knew there was something
different about that boy.

09:31.202 --> 09:32.836
I couldn't put my finger on it.

09:32.837 --> 09:35.105
He had a little sugar in his tank.

09:35.106 --> 09:36.607
Yeah, that's true.

09:36.608 --> 09:38.742
Okay. I-I don't know what to do.

09:38.743 --> 09:41.378
What are the rules of the
Big Brother program? I mean,

09:41.379 --> 09:43.113
do I encourage him to come out?

09:43.114 --> 09:45.781
Come out? Is he in the car?

09:47.517 --> 09:50.253
I mean tell everyone
that he's gay, you know?

09:50.254 --> 09:52.823
Like, what type of mom does Jordan have?

09:52.824 --> 09:54.524
Like, what if she kicks him out?

09:54.525 --> 09:55.525
I can't have him

09:55.526 --> 09:56.660
living with me.

09:56.661 --> 09:59.997
I mean, Maxine's horrible with kids.

09:59.998 --> 10:03.967
You know she once knocked
a baby out on an airplane?

10:03.968 --> 10:07.170
No, but it doesn't surprise me.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.406
So what are you gonna do, son?

10:09.407 --> 10:12.142
I don't know. I mean, that's why I'm here.

10:12.143 --> 10:14.544
The world's a tough,
judgmental place, and...

10:14.545 --> 10:17.080
you two are the toughest,
most judgmental people I know.

10:17.081 --> 10:20.317
- Oh, yes. Uh-huh.
- That's true. Yes, it is.

10:20.318 --> 10:22.953
I don't want to give
him bad advice, you know?

10:22.954 --> 10:24.955
What would you two say if
someone suddenly announced

10:24.956 --> 10:26.423
that they were gay?

10:26.424 --> 10:29.826
I would say, "Fine by me.
Ain't none of my business."

10:29.827 --> 10:31.061
Really?

10:31.062 --> 10:33.030
Absolutely. The Supreme Court has told me

10:33.031 --> 10:34.665
I need to accept these people,

10:34.666 --> 10:37.534
so I always do what the Supreme Court says.

10:37.535 --> 10:38.902
You know,

10:38.903 --> 10:41.872
I'm pretty sure the organ
player at church is gay.

10:41.873 --> 10:45.841
Last Sunday, he was wearing
more rings than a pirate.

10:48.578 --> 10:49.846
Big deal.

10:49.847 --> 10:51.181
So the boy is gay.

10:51.182 --> 10:52.716
He can still be a pro ballplayer.

10:52.717 --> 10:55.352
You go and tell that boy he
has nothing to be ashamed of.

10:55.353 --> 10:56.319
Mm-hmm.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.688
A-And tell him "it gets better."

10:57.689 --> 10:59.756
I heard that's what you
supposed to tell gay people

10:59.757 --> 11:01.891
so they feel like it's gonna get better.

11:03.326 --> 11:04.561
Let's go! Last shot wins!

11:04.562 --> 11:06.829
Go!

11:10.268 --> 11:11.268
Let's go!

11:11.269 --> 11:12.235
All right.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.236
See you after school.

11:13.237 --> 11:15.272
All right. Yeah.

11:15.273 --> 11:17.240
All right. All right, fine.

11:17.241 --> 11:18.608
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

11:18.609 --> 11:20.010
This isn't one of our days.

11:20.011 --> 11:21.144
I know, I know, I know.

11:21.145 --> 11:23.680
But I came to tell you, look...

11:23.681 --> 11:25.582
I'm totally cool with you being gay.

11:25.583 --> 11:28.018
Not only that, I think you
should tell the world, man.

11:28.019 --> 11:29.119
Whenever you're ready though.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.253
You're being serious?

11:30.254 --> 11:31.221
Yeah, absolutely.

11:31.222 --> 11:33.023
Now, how is that for advice, huh?

11:33.024 --> 11:35.559
Enlightened? Sure.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.560
Uh, evolved?

11:36.561 --> 11:37.994
I could go on and on

11:37.995 --> 11:40.864
about how well I'm handling this.

11:40.865 --> 11:43.667
I appreciate that,
Jerrod, I really do, but...

11:43.668 --> 11:45.736
the thing is...

11:45.737 --> 11:47.703
I'm not gay.

11:48.472 --> 11:51.007
What?

11:51.008 --> 11:52.943
I'm sorry, Jerrod, but the whole reason

11:52.944 --> 11:55.412
why I told you I was gay
was to test your reaction.

11:55.413 --> 11:58.715
What?

11:58.716 --> 12:01.952
If you had freaked out at
me when I told you I was gay,

12:01.953 --> 12:03.719
I wouldn't have said anything else.

12:05.155 --> 12:08.992
I never told anybody this before, but...

12:08.993 --> 12:10.793
I'm transgender.

12:12.562 --> 12:14.331
Okay.

12:14.332 --> 12:16.900
Do you know what that means?

12:16.901 --> 12:19.168
Mm-hmm.

12:21.104 --> 12:26.008
It means I'm a girl even
though you see me as a boy.

12:27.611 --> 12:30.046
Jordan, did you know basketball was created

12:30.047 --> 12:32.482
in Springfield, Massachusetts?

12:32.483 --> 12:34.017
They used peach baskets

12:34.018 --> 12:36.753
instead of regular hoops,
and they had to climb a ladder

12:36.754 --> 12:38.155
to get the ball out.

12:38.156 --> 12:40.196
Isn't that the craziest
thing you ever heard before?

12:41.192 --> 12:43.659
I just told you I'm transgender.

12:44.427 --> 12:46.695
Peach baskets!

12:51.271 --> 12:54.279
Bobby, just sign the darn
papers and get it over with.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.749
Yeah, you're like a slave who's
been offered his freedom papers

12:56.750 --> 13:00.152
who refuses to leave the plantation.

13:00.153 --> 13:01.654
Leave the plantation, son!

13:01.655 --> 13:02.821
All right.

13:02.822 --> 13:04.790
Ma, what do I do with Jordan, okay?

13:04.791 --> 13:06.058
Give me a new kid.

13:06.059 --> 13:09.495
I want a fire-starter or
a gangbanger, somebody...

13:09.496 --> 13:10.829
What are you talking about?

13:10.830 --> 13:13.732
Do not get rid of my gay golden goose.

13:13.733 --> 13:15.768
Do you know how many big-time

13:15.769 --> 13:18.103
endorsement opportunities
there are out there for him?

13:18.104 --> 13:20.305
CEO of Apple Computers... gay.

13:20.306 --> 13:23.075
Host of Ellen... gay.

13:23.076 --> 13:24.977
- Jordan's not gay, Joe.
- What?

13:24.978 --> 13:26.812
Jerrod, I hate when you do this to me.

13:26.813 --> 13:28.647
You get me all lathered up and excited.

13:28.648 --> 13:32.251
I've been reading about gay people all day.

13:32.252 --> 13:35.821
Yeah, well... Jordan's transgender.

13:35.822 --> 13:37.890
And I don't know how I'm
supposed to take that.

13:37.891 --> 13:39.358
I mean, he tells me he's a girl,

13:39.359 --> 13:41.694
but I'm looking at him
and clearly he's a boy.

13:41.695 --> 13:42.928
Transgender?

13:42.929 --> 13:44.930
You mean he like to dress up like a girl,

13:44.931 --> 13:48.534
like a little mini RuPaul?

13:48.535 --> 13:50.169
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

13:50.170 --> 13:52.738
He-he means like Bruce
Jenner, who's now Carol Ann.

13:52.739 --> 13:54.206
Oh.

13:54.207 --> 13:55.641
Oh.

13:55.642 --> 13:57.309
No, her name's Caitlyn.

13:57.310 --> 14:00.379
I know, but I don't like that name.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.815
You know what I don't understand
about the transgender people?

14:02.816 --> 14:03.849
All of it?

14:03.850 --> 14:05.117
Well, I'm saying,

14:05.118 --> 14:06.452
like, if I went to a party

14:06.453 --> 14:07.920
and I ran into Caitlyn Jenner, right,

14:07.921 --> 14:10.055
and Caitlyn Jenner steps on my shoe,

14:10.056 --> 14:13.791
am I allowed to punch Caitlyn Jenner?

14:17.496 --> 14:19.598
Hell yeah. It's 2015, baby.

14:19.599 --> 14:22.267
You can punch anybody.

14:22.268 --> 14:24.002
Why can't Jordan just be gay?

14:24.003 --> 14:26.105
You know? Like, I-I handled that so well.

14:26.106 --> 14:28.373
You know what I did when
he said he was transgender?

14:28.374 --> 14:30.309
I told him I left a CD in the car

14:30.310 --> 14:32.311
and then I drove here.

14:32.312 --> 14:34.847
Who has CDs anymore?

14:34.848 --> 14:37.850
First he's gay, now he's transgender.

14:37.851 --> 14:40.519
He's like one of those
little Russian dolls.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.788
Every time you think
you've hit the last one,

14:42.789 --> 14:45.791
surprise, there's another one!

14:45.792 --> 14:47.359
Next time you go back,

14:47.360 --> 14:49.628
he's gonna tell you he's Chinese.

14:51.797 --> 14:53.999
Why would Jordan want to become a woman?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.602
He's gonna make 78 cents
to every man's dollar.

14:56.603 --> 14:58.403
Right, right. Don't he
want to grow facial hair?

14:58.404 --> 15:00.372
I mean, he don't even
know if he like beards yet.

15:00.373 --> 15:02.007
I mean, look at me. I love mine.

15:02.008 --> 15:03.909
This is bad.

15:03.910 --> 15:05.511
You can bounce back from being gay,

15:05.512 --> 15:08.746
but once you turn the "P" into a "V"...

15:09.448 --> 15:10.983
No.

15:10.984 --> 15:13.252
Not everyone who's
transgender has surgery, Joe.

15:13.253 --> 15:16.088
Also, you don't "bounce
back" from being gay.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.357
You know, Jerrod,

15:18.358 --> 15:20.626
I would like to pray on this for you,

15:20.627 --> 15:24.662
but I don't want to put
the Lord in a awkward spot.

15:26.665 --> 15:28.033
He may not even know

15:28.034 --> 15:32.037
they got these transgenders
running around down here.

15:32.038 --> 15:34.173
Why are you guys so accepting of gays

15:34.174 --> 15:35.974
but not of someone being transgender?

15:35.975 --> 15:37.843
We are not against the transgender.

15:37.844 --> 15:39.812
But I'm just getting
used to people being gay,

15:39.813 --> 15:43.749
and they done changed the
rules on this one again.

15:43.750 --> 15:46.118
It's too fast.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.352
Too furious.

15:50.923 --> 15:52.858
You have to understand, Maxine.

15:52.859 --> 15:55.594
We went from not having a phone

15:55.595 --> 15:58.597
to having a phone with a long cord

15:58.598 --> 16:01.733
to having a cordless phone
to having a cell phone.

16:01.734 --> 16:05.404
Now we don't even call people, we text 'em.

16:05.405 --> 16:09.273
I just can't go through all these changes.

16:11.009 --> 16:12.711
Okay.

16:12.712 --> 16:16.114
So I think I understand
what being transgender means,

16:16.115 --> 16:17.282
in theory.

16:17.283 --> 16:19.251
It's what sex a person identifies as.

16:19.252 --> 16:20.719
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

16:20.720 --> 16:22.688
But, look, Jordan likes playing basketball.

16:22.689 --> 16:23.856
He's great at it.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.390
And he-he plays video games.

16:25.391 --> 16:28.961
We-we hiked a railroad
track to find a dead body.

16:28.962 --> 16:31.563
You're just describing Stand By Me.

16:31.564 --> 16:33.198
We watched Stand By Me.

16:33.199 --> 16:36.001
You know? I-I'm just saying
he likes to do boy things.

16:36.002 --> 16:38.270
There is no such thing as "boy things."

16:38.271 --> 16:39.805
Uh, I didn't see Stand By Me,

16:39.806 --> 16:43.742
but I have hiked to see a dead body.

16:43.743 --> 16:45.277
Okay, look, the whole thing with gender

16:45.278 --> 16:47.179
is that it's just a social construct.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.380
It's not innate.

16:48.381 --> 16:50.148
We are taught what is male and female.

16:50.149 --> 16:52.251
You know, I understand
what Maxine is saying.

16:52.252 --> 16:54.486
Most people think women just automatically

16:54.487 --> 16:56.255
make better parents than men.

16:56.256 --> 16:57.189
Exactly.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.757
But Jerrod, he adores children

16:58.758 --> 17:01.793
and you're terrified of
them, so that's not true.

17:01.794 --> 17:04.429
You told them?

17:04.430 --> 17:05.763
And it's a good thing he did,

17:05.765 --> 17:08.099
because you're not gonna
be holding our grandbabies,

17:08.101 --> 17:09.902
not with them butterfingers.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.403
Okay. Okay.

17:11.404 --> 17:12.871
Look, all right?

17:12.872 --> 17:15.607
I got this 13-year-old
kid who's really scared

17:15.608 --> 17:18.175
and he's really confused and
he's turning to me for guidance,

17:18.176 --> 17:19.511
and you guys aren't helping at all.

17:19.512 --> 17:21.380
I mean, this puts a lot of pressure on me.

17:21.381 --> 17:23.582
I mean, what am I
supposed to say to Jordan?

17:23.583 --> 17:25.017
Don't worry.

17:25.018 --> 17:28.754
The woman trapped inside of him
will tell the man what to do.

17:33.325 --> 17:35.127
That's a good one, Daddy!

17:35.128 --> 17:37.095
That was... that was my first joke

17:37.096 --> 17:38.697
on the transgender issue.

17:38.698 --> 17:40.965
Not half bad.

17:43.902 --> 17:44.903
Hey!

17:44.904 --> 17:45.904
That was nice.

17:45.905 --> 17:48.040
And I found my Lauryn Hill CD.

17:48.041 --> 17:50.175
Okay. All right, fine.

17:50.176 --> 17:51.510
I-I'm not gonna lie to you.

17:51.511 --> 17:52.911
I-I got scared, all right?

17:52.912 --> 17:56.315
I drove home and bought this
on my way back over here.

17:56.316 --> 17:58.383
Yeah, you've been gone
for a couple of hours.

17:58.384 --> 17:59.952
Figured something happened.

17:59.953 --> 18:03.021
Jordan, you've been a really,
really difficult Little Brother.

18:03.022 --> 18:05.290
I mean, you left a lot of
stuff off your application.

18:05.291 --> 18:07.259
I'm sorry, Jerrod.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.227
Why don't we just forget I said anything?

18:09.228 --> 18:10.929
I'll figure it out.

18:10.930 --> 18:12.097
Let's play.

18:12.098 --> 18:14.633
You... you just told me you're a girl.

18:14.634 --> 18:16.501
How am I supposed to forget that?

18:16.502 --> 18:18.937
I just want you to be sure
you know what you're doing.

18:18.938 --> 18:20.638
Okay, come here.

18:21.406 --> 18:23.809
All right, so...

18:23.810 --> 18:25.444
when I was 14, all right,

18:25.445 --> 18:27.846
I really wanted to be Puff Daddy.

18:27.847 --> 18:30.482
And... I figured

18:30.483 --> 18:33.352
all I had to do was go out
and buy a blue velour suit,

18:33.353 --> 18:34.786
and I'd be set.

18:34.787 --> 18:37.556
But then came this trial,
which we'll get into later,

18:37.557 --> 18:39.791
and he changed his name to P. Diddy,

18:39.792 --> 18:42.594
then just to Diddy, and now
I hear he's Puff Daddy again,

18:42.595 --> 18:44.329
and every time he changed his name,

18:44.330 --> 18:47.499
he changed his look, and I would
have never been able to keep up.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.634
Look, the point I'm trying to make is

18:49.635 --> 18:51.837
I want you to be 100%
sure before you're stuck

18:51.838 --> 18:53.705
out in the world wearing
a blue velour suit.

18:53.706 --> 18:55.340
D-Do you know what I'm saying to you?

18:55.341 --> 18:57.642
No. Do you know what you're saying?

18:57.643 --> 18:59.511
No.

18:59.512 --> 19:01.046
Uh, I just figured

19:01.047 --> 19:03.181
I'd keep talking and
eventually you'd turn 18

19:03.182 --> 19:05.550
and wouldn't need me anymore.

19:05.551 --> 19:07.853
I didn't ask you to help me figure out

19:07.854 --> 19:09.621
whether or not I'm transgender.

19:09.622 --> 19:11.123
I am.

19:11.124 --> 19:14.426
I know. But you're asking me
to understand it, and I don't.

19:14.427 --> 19:16.395
- And that's the honest truth, Jordan.
- Okay.

19:16.396 --> 19:18.096
Well, at least you're being honest about it

19:18.097 --> 19:19.831
instead of acting all weird.

19:19.832 --> 19:22.901
You can't handle it, my mom
won't be able to handle it,

19:22.902 --> 19:25.237
guys on my team, friends at school.

19:25.238 --> 19:28.373
I'll just have to deal with it on my own.

19:28.374 --> 19:30.042
Hold on.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.210
Look, the fact that I don't

19:32.211 --> 19:34.880
totally get it doesn't mean I
don't hear what you're saying

19:34.881 --> 19:36.381
or I don't believe you.

19:36.382 --> 19:38.250
I know that this is real.

19:38.251 --> 19:40.385
Truthfully...

19:40.386 --> 19:42.487
I don't have to get it 100%

19:42.488 --> 19:45.791
in order to support you 100%, okay?

19:45.792 --> 19:47.559
I'm gonna help you tell your mom.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.261
Really?

19:49.262 --> 19:51.229
Yeah, yeah.

19:51.230 --> 19:53.598
And no matter what she says, remember,

19:53.599 --> 19:55.434
she robbed a bank.

19:55.435 --> 19:57.835
You're way better than her.

20:03.047 --> 20:05.686
Hey, Jerrod, it's me, Bobby.

20:06.765 --> 20:08.606
Look here, I need you to
look at these divorce papers

20:08.607 --> 20:11.128
for me before Nekeisha tracks me down.

20:11.129 --> 20:13.431
Well, Bobby...

20:13.432 --> 20:15.865
I don't know, this all
looks pretty standard.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.935
I mean, you got no kids,

20:18.936 --> 20:21.971
no property, no bank account.

20:21.972 --> 20:24.506
God, y'all got nothing.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.343
According to her financial records,

20:27.344 --> 20:29.512
Nekeisha makes more money than you.

20:29.513 --> 20:30.580
Duh.

20:30.581 --> 20:32.982
Everybody make more money than me.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.118
Wait, are you saying that
she would owe him money?

20:35.119 --> 20:36.753
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.

20:36.754 --> 20:38.121
- Bobby!
- Oh, it's Keisha.

20:38.122 --> 20:39.789
- Give me that.
- Hey, you better sign this quick.

20:39.790 --> 20:41.190
Hurry up, before she gets here.

20:42.926 --> 20:44.661
Bobby, time's up.

20:44.662 --> 20:46.996
Hello, Nekeisha.

20:46.997 --> 20:49.065
I know you was looking for these.

20:49.066 --> 20:50.300
Thank God.

20:50.301 --> 20:51.835
Ha! Got you!

20:51.836 --> 20:54.604
You make more money than me,
so now you owe me support.

20:54.605 --> 20:57.474
I ain't paying you nothing.

20:57.475 --> 20:59.709
We gonna stay married
till I figure out a way

20:59.710 --> 21:02.212
to make less money than you.

21:02.213 --> 21:04.214
Good luck with that.
