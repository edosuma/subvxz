WEBVTT

00:22.065 --> 00:23.719
First the fucking UN,

00:23.719 --> 00:25.547
Now they blew up
your goddamn house.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.157
Let me protect you.

00:27.157 --> 00:28.550
I'm already
a dead man walking.

00:28.550 --> 00:30.247
There's nothing you
or anyone can do about it.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.510
There's another shipment,
bigger than the one we had.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.860
You and I, let's handle it.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.340
I gotta save my friend.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.342
My father's gonna come
gunning for you.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.605
This isn't about Harlem.
It's about me.

00:40.605 --> 00:43.173
Look, I'm gonna show him
the utmost respect

00:43.173 --> 00:44.957
at the sit-down tomorrow.

00:45.784 --> 00:48.091
If any of youse have
agreements with Colombo,

00:48.091 --> 00:49.701
they no longer matter.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.355
I want Joe the fuck
out of Harlem.

00:51.355 --> 00:54.097
Jose Battle and I have
a plan to give you--

00:54.097 --> 00:55.925
Havana.
With the help of the CIA,

00:55.925 --> 00:58.101
you can rebuild
your casinos there.

00:58.101 --> 00:59.102
They ain't got fuckin'
no connections to the--

00:59.102 --> 01:00.756
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:00.756 --> 01:03.411
Allow me to explain what
your government can do for you.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.413
The fuck is this?

01:05.413 --> 01:06.544
I just want my daughter.

01:06.544 --> 01:07.937
I'm staying here with Joe.

01:09.765 --> 01:12.072
Hey, Elise.
I'm sorry, d--

01:12.072 --> 01:15.379
Your father thinks
he can blackmail me.

01:15.379 --> 01:17.555
No, no, no.
No, no. Please, don't!

01:17.555 --> 01:19.731
But I can make his life
as miserable...

01:23.996 --> 01:25.824
<i>...as he makes mine.</i>

01:25.824 --> 01:27.913
<i>I reconsidered
your proposal.</i>

01:27.913 --> 01:30.264
Let's take back Harlem.

01:34.529 --> 01:37.401
I won't ever do anything
to threaten you again.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.099
I swear.

01:40.361 --> 01:43.146
What exactly do you have
in terms of documentation?

01:43.146 --> 01:44.930
Thought you might ask.

01:44.930 --> 01:45.888
Here.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.457
It's Operation Mongoose.

01:49.457 --> 01:52.242
Your plan to kill Castro
using mob hitmen.

01:57.247 --> 02:01.686
Look, my daughter
means everything to me.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.601
You obviously know that.

02:03.601 --> 02:06.778
That she's fragile.

02:06.778 --> 02:08.606
That, uh, hotshot
you gave her--

02:08.606 --> 02:10.130
it almost killed her.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.176
I wanted to send a message,
not end her life.

02:13.176 --> 02:15.222
Message received.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.791
Just wanted you
to know that.

02:32.500 --> 02:37.157
The Bay of Pigs
invasion was an embarrassment.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.377
We were left stranded
on the beach,

02:40.377 --> 02:42.684
imprisoned,

02:42.684 --> 02:46.383
abandoned and betrayed
by that fucking coward,

02:46.383 --> 02:50.518
Jack Kennedy,
who had promised us air support.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.913
But that's not gonna
happen again.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.567
Our second invasion
will be successful,

02:56.567 --> 03:00.049
and we will take back Cuba
from Castro.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.716
This is our chance, Vincent.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.326
We can be bigger in Havana

03:16.326 --> 03:18.850
than we ever were
in the glory days.

03:18.850 --> 03:21.592
There's a supply of cocaine,
heroin, and weapons

03:21.592 --> 03:25.030
from the CIA
coming tomorrow.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.511
The guns will be trucked
to Louisiana,

03:27.511 --> 03:29.774
where my militia
is training.

03:29.774 --> 03:32.516
We want to use Randall's Island
for the drop,

03:32.516 --> 03:34.126
your territory.

03:34.126 --> 03:38.696
Now, the other bosses
have already agreed, so...

03:38.696 --> 03:41.221
if you're amenable,

03:41.221 --> 03:44.441
we can move forward
without hesitation.

03:48.140 --> 03:51.231
How much is my cut?

03:51.231 --> 03:54.364
Well, I estimate...

03:54.364 --> 03:56.584
upwards of $10 million.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.415
Yeah.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.418
♪ Hey

04:16.430 --> 04:17.866
How you doing?

04:20.347 --> 04:22.784
Oh, this is good, right?

04:22.784 --> 04:25.787
You and me, making a shitload
of money together.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.400
You think big,
I'll give you that.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.141
Eh, you know,

04:32.141 --> 04:34.012
it was your daughter
that pegged Randall's Island

04:34.012 --> 04:36.972
as the perfect drop spot.

04:36.972 --> 04:39.801
She's been advising me,
you know?

04:39.801 --> 04:41.803
What do you mean,
advising you?

04:41.803 --> 04:44.588
Well, she obviously learned
a lot from you.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.460
Got a real good head
on her shoulders.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.810
Mm.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.378
With a face to match,
you know what I mean?

04:54.381 --> 04:57.427
Yeah.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.124
She does.

04:59.124 --> 05:01.301
I swear to Christ,
it was all I could do

05:01.301 --> 05:03.128
not to snap
that prick's neck.

05:03.128 --> 05:05.609
Well, you gotta keep
cool. Just work that angle.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.829
It's my girl.
It's hard.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.526
Who you talking to?

05:09.526 --> 05:11.615
If it wasn't
for our plan,

05:11.615 --> 05:14.183
Harvey'd be a grease spot
right now.

05:14.183 --> 05:15.967
He bought it?

05:15.967 --> 05:17.317
Fuck if I know.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.144
Gotta be ready
to stick and move.

05:19.144 --> 05:21.364
Or we could just blow all these
motherfuckers' heads off now

05:21.364 --> 05:22.800
and end it.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.195
No rash moves.

05:26.195 --> 05:28.850
But things go well,
this time tomorrow,

05:28.850 --> 05:31.374
we'll be back
in control of Harlem.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.897
Yeah.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.986

How you feeling?

I'm fine, Daddy.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.791
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

08:07.791 --> 08:10.794
To the Hotel Theresa
to meet Malcolm.

08:10.794 --> 08:14.494
I'm gonna get some of my men
to drive you over there.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.539
To protect me...

08:16.539 --> 08:19.411
or to make sure I don't
go back to using duji?

08:19.411 --> 08:21.631
Maybe a little of both.

08:21.631 --> 08:24.416
Praise Allah. I have looked
the monster in the eye

08:24.416 --> 08:26.549
and I've killed him.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.246
You can trust me.

08:28.246 --> 08:30.553
It's my fault.

08:30.553 --> 08:33.513
I, uh, got mixed up
with the wrong people.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.428
You're always mixed up
with the wrong people.

08:36.428 --> 08:37.952
I've accepted that.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.825
Yeah.

08:41.825 --> 08:44.088
You going to the Audubon
this afternoon?

08:44.088 --> 08:46.003
Yes.
Of course.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.528
I got Chance and Pettigrew
working with Omar

08:48.528 --> 08:51.443
to lock down
that ballroom.

08:51.443 --> 08:54.708
I feel a little guilty we're
operating behind Malcolm's back.

08:54.708 --> 08:58.276
Yeah, well, his back needs
to be covered,

08:58.276 --> 08:59.930
as well as his front.

09:07.677 --> 09:08.983
I love you.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.203
You, too, Daddy.

09:29.612 --> 09:33.050
Big day today.

09:33.050 --> 09:37.228
My father actually agreed
to let you be in charge?

09:37.228 --> 09:39.970
He saw the wisdom of it,
from what I can tell.

09:41.493 --> 09:44.584
Told him Randall's Island
was your idea.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.892
I think he knows we have
feelings for each other.

09:48.892 --> 09:52.243
That don't sound
like my father.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.463
I can handle Chin.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.291
He'll get his piece
of the shipment,

09:56.291 --> 09:59.250
make a fortune,
all will be well.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.602
You okay?

10:06.301 --> 10:08.216
I think
we should stop it.

10:10.479 --> 10:13.308
What are you talking about?

10:13.308 --> 10:14.744
It.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.833
This. Us.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.444
It was a mistake.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.490
Why?
What's wrong?

10:21.490 --> 10:24.101
My father's lying.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.408
There's no way
he'll accept us together.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.891
I like you, Joe.

10:34.677 --> 10:37.549
I don't wanna see
you end up dead.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.704
China?

11:01.704 --> 11:05.055
Nobody cares about you
in China.

11:05.055 --> 11:07.362
We'll be safe there.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.671
Only my sister would think
to buy us tickets

11:11.671 --> 11:15.065
to a Communist country
for safety's sake.

11:15.065 --> 11:17.198
She's worried.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.852
And so am I.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.854
Aren't you?

11:20.854 --> 11:22.725
Between you and Ella,

11:22.725 --> 11:24.727
I think there's enough
worry to go around.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.077
What do you expect?

11:27.077 --> 11:29.645
Ella loves you
almost as much as I do.

11:33.954 --> 11:39.699
Betty Shabazz, ah, you are
my Crescent and Star.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.007
I'd like to bring
the older girls

11:44.007 --> 11:45.530
to the Audubon
this afternoon.

11:45.530 --> 11:48.446
Oh, no.
I'm not sure that's wise.

11:48.446 --> 11:52.842
We may find Afro-American unity
to be a fascinating subject,

11:52.842 --> 11:55.105
but they'll be
bored to tears.

11:55.105 --> 11:58.456
They watched their house
burn down to the ground.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.197
They should see how
their father carries on

12:00.197 --> 12:02.504
despite the forces
against him.

12:05.072 --> 12:08.597
After the speech, we'll pack
our things for the trip.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.730
Mm.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.601
Do you think
the food in China is, uh,

12:12.601 --> 12:14.472
anywhere near as good
as Wo Hop?

12:17.867 --> 12:19.913
Mm.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.917
Joe Bonanno
was banned from New York

12:23.917 --> 12:26.397
and Chin Gigante
was put behind bars.

12:26.397 --> 12:28.922
So, in my absence,

12:28.922 --> 12:34.101
Joe Colombo has taken over
the Five Families.

12:34.101 --> 12:37.191
But there's no active
investigation against him.

12:38.714 --> 12:40.455
Care to explain?

12:42.849 --> 12:47.114
Sir, the-- the DOJ directive
came in loud and clear.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.072
We're to focus
our prosecutorial efforts

12:49.072 --> 12:51.161
on Black militant leaders.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.902
Namely Malcolm X.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.122
He's calling for a violent
revolution in the streets.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.601
Maybe you need to go back
to law school

12:56.601 --> 12:58.081
and read
the First Amendment.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.127
It's called free speech.

13:00.127 --> 13:03.173
The Department of Justice
is rightly concerned

13:03.173 --> 13:07.090
about a charismatic leader
who'd unite all factions

13:07.090 --> 13:09.353
of the so-called
civil rights movement.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.703
Mr. Morgenthau,
there's someone here to see you.

13:11.703 --> 13:14.097
Um, I'm a little busy.

13:14.097 --> 13:16.012
It's Ellsworth Johnson.

13:18.406 --> 13:21.104
Alright, send him in.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.324
What the hell
do you think he wants?

13:23.324 --> 13:25.674
Hell if I know.

13:25.674 --> 13:26.849
Hey, fellas.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.329
Mr. Johnson.

13:28.329 --> 13:31.506
This is Assistant
District Attorney Pike.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.290
I'm aware of Mr. Pike.

13:33.290 --> 13:36.032
He likes to spend his time
harassing my wife to get to me.

13:37.729 --> 13:40.254
Well, here I am.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.039
And why are you here?

13:43.039 --> 13:45.563
I'm a concerned citizen
with an anonymous tip.

13:55.225 --> 13:56.661
<i>Congressman Powell
is here</i>

13:56.661 --> 13:58.141
<i>to see you, Mr. President.</i>

13:58.141 --> 13:59.839
Well, send him the hell in.

14:02.363 --> 14:05.235
In honor of
the 24th Amendment,

14:05.235 --> 14:09.587
I have brought us
some of the good stuff.

14:09.587 --> 14:12.329
Yeah, well, I don't feel
much like celebrating

14:12.329 --> 14:15.028
when my so-called
civil rights champion

14:15.028 --> 14:17.726
in Congress
stabs me in the back.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.771
Ah, don't worry
about the education bill.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.383
I will bring that
to the floor

14:22.383 --> 14:26.953
once you guarantee
an extra $400,000 for Harlem.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.522
There's no pleasing you,
is there?

14:31.522 --> 14:33.916
I just eliminated all poll tax
for Negroes.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.613
Which should never have been
there in the first place.

14:35.613 --> 14:40.575
I mean, can you imagine forcing
people to pay a fee to vote?

14:42.142 --> 14:44.361
In 1942, as a councilman,

14:44.361 --> 14:46.886
I walked from Union Station
to the Capitol

14:46.886 --> 14:48.713
to protest a poll tax
on Negroes,

14:48.713 --> 14:54.676
and it took until 1965
to be removed.

14:57.418 --> 14:59.811
Now, we both know
that our enemies

14:59.811 --> 15:03.467
will find other means
to suppress the vote.

15:03.467 --> 15:07.384
Everything I'm about is getting
that Voting Rights Act passed,

15:07.384 --> 15:10.953
but I need
an education bill first.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.737
Gotta help me.

15:12.737 --> 15:15.566
Take the pork out of your bill
and bring it to the floor.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.481
I'm begging you.
Come on now.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.747
Okay.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.532
Fine.

15:25.489 --> 15:31.060
Our democracy won't mean shit
without a Voting Rights Act.

15:31.060 --> 15:36.631
And a Voting Rights Act won't
mean shit unless people vote.

15:36.631 --> 15:38.546
Well, I'll drink to that.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.986
I confess to being, um,

15:43.986 --> 15:47.598
a little bit surprised,
Mr. Johnson.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.818
I thought
you didn't snitch.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.951
I don't.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.083
So what the fuck
is this?

15:54.083 --> 15:55.519
Why are you
wasting our time?

15:55.519 --> 15:57.347
Morgenthau's right.

15:57.347 --> 16:00.437
I don't snitch on partners
or colleagues

16:00.437 --> 16:04.137
unless they work for
the United States government.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.009
I'm listening.

16:07.009 --> 16:10.621
For the last three months,
the Central Intelligence Agency

16:10.621 --> 16:12.884
has been pipe-lining
seized cocaine

16:12.884 --> 16:15.278
to fund a second invasion
of Cuba.

16:15.278 --> 16:18.803
Now they're moving into heroin
and gun-running as well.

16:18.803 --> 16:23.199
The operation's run by a man
by the name of William Harvey.

16:23.199 --> 16:25.158
He started
as an FBI man.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.203
From what I'm told,
he was on your side

16:27.203 --> 16:29.162
until he jumped
to the CIA.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.690
Okay.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.692
We'll bite.

16:37.692 --> 16:39.520
What information you got
on Harvey?

16:43.611 --> 16:46.092
Morgenthau, you know
that's not the way it works.

16:47.702 --> 16:51.010
Before I spill,
we gotta make a deal.

16:56.493 --> 17:00.410
Entrances here,
two exits in the back,

17:00.410 --> 17:02.021
staircase here
from the lobby,

17:02.021 --> 17:04.762
bathrooms just outside
the entrance.

17:04.762 --> 17:07.069
The folding chairs
will be in rows.

17:07.069 --> 17:10.159
Better split up the chairs,
make a center aisle.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.856
Why's that?

17:11.856 --> 17:14.033
Somebody pulls out a piece,
we can get to 'em faster.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.427
Alright.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.603
Makes sense.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.910
Junie, I want you out front

17:21.910 --> 17:23.738
frisking anybody
who want to come in.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.696
- You got it.
- We can't do that.

17:25.696 --> 17:27.046
Why not?

17:27.046 --> 17:29.700
Malcolm doesn't want
anyone frisked.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.876
What in the hell
you talking about?

17:31.876 --> 17:35.184
Malcolm doesn't want young
people put off by checkpoints.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.534
We're expecting a lot of
college students.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.455
How in the hell are we supposed
to protect a motherfucker

17:45.455 --> 17:47.240
who don't want
protection?

17:49.111 --> 17:50.895
You know what?

17:50.895 --> 17:54.943
I am in the mood
for a Cuba Libre.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.337
Okay.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.602
We're gonna take back
your homeland, Jose.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.696
What's wrong,
pal-o-mine?

18:11.525 --> 18:14.223
I know Bumpy Johnson.

18:14.223 --> 18:17.096
He's up to something,
believe me.

18:20.055 --> 18:23.145
Yeah, you're probably right.
But what can he do?

18:23.145 --> 18:24.973
Do not underestimate him.

18:26.888 --> 18:29.020
Ugh.
That's too sweet.

18:32.633 --> 18:36.332
My station chief
in West Berlin

18:36.332 --> 18:39.030
used to toss a cat
out a three-story window

18:39.030 --> 18:41.250
so we could all watch

18:41.250 --> 18:43.992
what makes them always land
on their feet.

18:43.992 --> 18:45.428
You know how?

18:45.428 --> 18:47.169
I don't believe I care.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.693
Well, it's
a righting reflex.

18:49.693 --> 18:54.829
No matter how the cat's thrown,
it bends and twists

18:54.829 --> 18:58.354
until its ass is in
the right position to land.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.443
Johnson wasn't
cooperating,

19:00.443 --> 19:04.708
so I bent and twisted
until I found what worked.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.406
That is what I do.

19:08.712 --> 19:11.541
A cat has nine lives.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.630
Even if it breaks its neck,

19:13.630 --> 19:17.199
it can come back
and fuck with you.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.462
Johnson's not stupid.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.464
He knows the power
and the reach of the CIA,

19:21.464 --> 19:25.381
and he's not stupid enough
to fuck with me.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.470
You kidnapped
his daughter.

19:27.470 --> 19:30.908
He sees you as a threat
to Malcolm X.

19:30.908 --> 19:35.783
Johnson has a "righting reflex,"
just like you do.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.006
Fine.

19:42.006 --> 19:45.749
I'll, uh...
have him tailed.

19:45.749 --> 19:49.492
I'll be on his ass
if he tries anything.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.581
Mm. Ugh.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.714
You have to finish
that shit.

19:56.717 --> 19:59.328
I asked you here
for two reasons.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.896
One, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Cyril DeGrasse Tyson.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.680
Oh, it's an honor.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.378
I have admired your work
in education

20:05.378 --> 20:07.684
and urban outreach
for years.

20:07.684 --> 20:09.120
Thank you.

20:09.120 --> 20:13.168
And second,
to give you this.

20:16.519 --> 20:19.914
Well, it's wonderful,
but unnecessary.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.350
You deserve it.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.874
I wanted there to be some
tangible recognition

20:23.874 --> 20:25.398
for all the work
you've done.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.138
Well, the work's
just getting started.

20:27.138 --> 20:29.271
Let me cut
to the chase.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.621
I'm the new administrative
director at HARYOU,

20:31.621 --> 20:33.580
and I'm afraid...

20:33.580 --> 20:35.538
you're out.

20:35.538 --> 20:36.757
Cyril--

20:36.757 --> 20:38.541
There's no room
for gangsters

20:38.541 --> 20:41.065
or their wives
in this organization.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.719
It isn't the message
that I wish to send

20:42.719 --> 20:45.113
to our community
or our children.

20:48.769 --> 20:51.728
Does Congressman Powell
know about this?

20:51.728 --> 20:53.991
It-- It wasn't his choice,
nor mine,

20:53.991 --> 20:56.994
but Cyril has been tasked
by the governor

20:56.994 --> 20:59.910
with merging his community
action program with ours,

20:59.910 --> 21:03.784
so he's calling the shots.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.655
I'm sorry, Mayme.

21:08.441 --> 21:11.748
Well, Mr. Tyson,

21:11.748 --> 21:14.490
I wish you
the best of luck.

21:14.490 --> 21:18.015
And if you don't mind, I'd like
to make one last contribution.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.278
What is it?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.802
It's this.

21:21.802 --> 21:25.806
Why don't you take it
and shove it up your ass?

21:52.876 --> 21:55.531
Joe.

21:55.531 --> 21:57.359
I'm leaving.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.492
I just wanted
to say goodbye.

21:59.492 --> 22:01.320
What?

22:01.320 --> 22:04.627
That ticket to Paris
you gave me-- I'm gonna use it.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.237
The fuck are you
talking about?

22:06.237 --> 22:08.718
I'll send for the rest
of my things later.

22:08.718 --> 22:10.546
What is this?
What happened?

22:10.546 --> 22:13.244
Why can't you call this off
for your own safety?

22:13.244 --> 22:14.811
Call this off?

22:14.811 --> 22:16.900
This is everything
I've been working for.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.902
I don't wanna see
how it ends.

22:18.902 --> 22:22.471
Stella,
this is business.

22:22.471 --> 22:24.386
I know
what the fuck I'm doing.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.345
My father
will crush you.

22:28.608 --> 22:31.480
Everybody,
get the fuck out.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.264
Get the fuck out!

22:39.662 --> 22:44.493
I have this
under control.

22:44.493 --> 22:47.888
This is the biggest fucking deal
of my life,

22:47.888 --> 22:49.672
and you're just gonna
fucking leave?

22:49.672 --> 22:51.152
Yeah.

22:53.284 --> 22:55.243
Go.

22:55.243 --> 22:56.766
Joe.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.553
Before I get
on that plane,

23:00.553 --> 23:03.643
I'm gonna take one last shot
at saving your life.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.342
Wish me luck.

23:14.131 --> 23:15.698
What makes you think
Robert Morgenthau

23:15.698 --> 23:17.439
ain't gonna turn around
and fuck us?

23:17.439 --> 23:20.573
There's enough information
in that Operation Mongoose file

23:20.573 --> 23:23.880
to fry both the FBI
and the CIA.

23:23.880 --> 23:28.319
If Morgenthau can nail Harvey,
it'll grant us immunity.

23:28.319 --> 23:31.105
William Harvey is our
life insurance policy.

23:33.324 --> 23:36.110
Yeah, but insurance
doesn't usually pay off

23:36.110 --> 23:38.242
until after you're dead.

23:44.161 --> 23:45.989
Take your weapons
and toss them to the ground.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.078
Don't make me shoot you
between the eyes.

23:56.565 --> 23:59.089
First off, I don't appreciate
your efforts

23:59.089 --> 24:01.962
to cut a deal
with Robert Morgenthau.

24:01.962 --> 24:04.486
Think I didn't have a plant
in his office?

24:04.486 --> 24:06.009
Morgenthau arrests me,

24:06.009 --> 24:08.751
and in exchange for immunity,
you go scot-free.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.492
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.320
That's clever.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.497
You ever want to work for
the CIA, I'll find you a job.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.457
- What do you want?
- Gigante, I need you

24:18.457 --> 24:20.589
to secure the delivery
on Randall's Island.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.765
Johnson, I need you
to distribute the narcotics.

24:22.765 --> 24:25.115
Who the fuck
you think you are?

24:25.115 --> 24:30.120
You both have
daughters, right?

24:30.120 --> 24:32.471
You are protective of them.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.517
Do as I ask,
clam up with the Feds,

24:35.517 --> 24:37.606
and we can all be friends.

24:37.606 --> 24:40.304
You're threatening
my daughter?

24:40.304 --> 24:42.959
I'm not your enemy.
I'm your benefactor.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.005
We're all gonna make
a lot of money.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.789
Just do what you're told

24:46.789 --> 24:49.488
and I will never have to think
about your children again.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.141
What about Morgenthau?

24:51.141 --> 24:54.231
Read him a fucking fairy tale
if he wants dirt on me.

24:54.231 --> 24:55.798
I got you covered.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.408
Nobody'll touch you.

24:57.408 --> 24:58.671
You got all the cards.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.977
Well, that's correct.

25:00.977 --> 25:04.154
But I can't fault you
for trying.

25:04.154 --> 25:05.982
Do we have
an agreement?

25:20.823 --> 25:22.651
Agreed.

25:34.794 --> 25:37.405
I think our life insurance
just got canceled.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.544
What's to keep Morgenthau
from arresting us

25:45.544 --> 25:47.676
once he sees
that Harvey's not there?

25:47.676 --> 25:49.591
Not much.

25:51.114 --> 25:53.595
If you want to bail,
I'll go this alone.

25:58.252 --> 26:00.123
Fuck it.

26:00.123 --> 26:04.388
Fuck it, I'd rather be dead than
let Colombo take what's ours.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.912
Mm.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.533
You're home.

26:21.971 --> 26:23.625
I've been fired.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.322
What?

26:28.108 --> 26:31.067
HARYOU has a new director.

26:31.067 --> 26:34.593
Cyril DeGrasse Tyson.

26:34.593 --> 26:38.422
He doesn't want me involved
because I'm married to you.

26:38.422 --> 26:39.815
Congressman Powell
know about this?

26:39.815 --> 26:43.253
He's in Washington.
It was a sneak attack.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.081
Just humiliating.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.256
I'll see what
I can do about it.

26:46.256 --> 26:47.997
Oh, don't bother.

26:50.391 --> 26:54.438
They will never accept me
as long as I am with you.

26:54.438 --> 26:55.962
Mayme, I don't think
that's true.

26:55.962 --> 27:00.793
In your heart,
you are a good man, Ellsworth.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.669
But you and I have
both made immoral choices.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.105
Mayme, please.

27:09.105 --> 27:12.021
You-- You helped keep
that organization alive.

27:12.021 --> 27:15.764
When I married you...

27:15.764 --> 27:17.984
I made a deal
with the devil.

27:21.509 --> 27:23.554
And I just have
to accept that.

27:47.361 --> 27:51.582
Dear Lord Jesus, we beseech you
to bless this family

27:51.582 --> 27:54.150
and to guide us to be better
instruments of thine will.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.761
Amen.

27:58.285 --> 28:00.853
Yeah, well...

28:00.853 --> 28:02.985
I could use a prayer

28:02.985 --> 28:05.466
that helps me
destroy my enemies.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.992
Vincent, we must trust

28:09.992 --> 28:11.559
that the Lord knows
what's best for you.

28:15.128 --> 28:17.173
- Am I interrupting?
- No.

28:17.173 --> 28:18.697
What are you doing here?

28:18.697 --> 28:20.350
I just came
to get some things.

28:20.350 --> 28:22.439
I'm leaving
the country.

28:23.658 --> 28:25.747
What about Colombo?

28:25.747 --> 28:28.184
That was a mistake.

28:28.184 --> 28:29.882
A big one.

28:29.882 --> 28:32.754
Stella, praise the Lord
that you've come to your senses.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.016
Yeah.

28:34.016 --> 28:36.453
Dad...

28:36.453 --> 28:39.848
are you gonna kill
Joe Colombo?

28:39.848 --> 28:42.459
No.
I don't kill people, Stella.

28:42.459 --> 28:44.200
Fuck you.
I need you to promise me

28:44.200 --> 28:45.636
that you're not gonna kill him.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.638
You heard him.
He's not gonna harm anyone.

28:47.638 --> 28:49.858
Uncle Louie, your head's shoved
so far up your fucking Bible,

28:49.858 --> 28:51.425
you won't admit
what's right in front of you.

28:51.425 --> 28:53.427
And you need to admit
your sins to the Lord.

28:53.427 --> 28:54.907
Would you
shut the fuck up?

28:54.907 --> 28:57.126
You can both rot in hell.

28:57.126 --> 28:59.781
I don't even care this time.
I'm going to Paris.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.436
No, stay here, stay here.
Listen to me.

29:05.308 --> 29:08.050
O-Olympia,
she's gone, right?

29:08.050 --> 29:09.617
For good.

29:11.532 --> 29:14.230
And I promise, I-I won't lay
a hand on Colombo.

29:14.230 --> 29:16.319
How can I possibly
trust you?

29:16.319 --> 29:18.408
Well, that's easy.

29:18.408 --> 29:21.107
Joe told me that you gave him
the idea for Randall's Island.

29:21.107 --> 29:22.586
So?

29:22.586 --> 29:24.197
It was smart.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.940
She's a smart girl.

29:29.463 --> 29:32.814
So, you stay here.

29:32.814 --> 29:36.252
You work with me.

29:36.252 --> 29:39.255
I'll bring you
into everything I do,

29:39.255 --> 29:41.562
and I'll give you a piece,
a good piece.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.307
Will that
make you happy?

29:49.831 --> 29:52.791
How strong is the trust
that you set up for my family?

29:52.791 --> 29:56.838
They could live
to the biblical age of 900

29:56.838 --> 29:58.797
and do it in style.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.150
And what if something
happened to me?

30:04.150 --> 30:07.153
What's gonna happen
to you?

30:07.153 --> 30:11.200
- It's a thought experiment.
- Is everything alright?

30:11.200 --> 30:13.507
Just wanna make sure the people
that I love are taken care of.

30:13.507 --> 30:15.814
That's all.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.207
Bumpy,
you're scaring me.

30:20.035 --> 30:21.689
I cost Mayme her job.

30:21.689 --> 30:23.647
I've been pretending
that what I do

30:23.647 --> 30:26.389
doesn't affect
the people that I love.

30:26.389 --> 30:27.869
But it does.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.004
I'm sorry.

30:34.180 --> 30:35.877
What if I stop
selling narcotics?

30:35.877 --> 30:37.661
What would that look like?

30:37.661 --> 30:39.315
Ugly.

30:39.315 --> 30:43.537
I mean, narcotics is
the backbone of your business.

30:43.537 --> 30:46.409
A wise man knows
when to change.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.194
I'm long overdue.

30:48.194 --> 30:50.370
Who's wiser than you?

30:50.370 --> 30:52.328
Malcolm.

30:52.328 --> 30:57.246
He's been trying to get me
to change my life.

30:57.246 --> 31:00.597
He's an idealist.

31:00.597 --> 31:04.079
But you--
you're a realist.

31:05.515 --> 31:09.868
Malcolm is a man who lives
to the fullest of his potential.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.347
Me...

31:11.347 --> 31:15.699
I'm just using
a fraction of mine.

31:27.015 --> 31:29.626
<i>I was told...</i>

31:29.626 --> 31:33.195
<i>you only die once,</i>

31:33.195 --> 31:37.025
<i>so you should live every day...</i>

31:37.025 --> 31:40.115

31:40.115 --> 31:43.379

Brother Minister.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.086
Yeah, I'm coming.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.786
Just a moment.

31:58.786 --> 32:01.310

33:05.070 --> 33:06.854
Thank you.

33:09.509 --> 33:12.816
Well, I just heard
that you brought

33:12.816 --> 33:15.471
the education bill
to the floor.

33:15.471 --> 33:17.473
Thank you.

33:17.473 --> 33:23.523
I do feel unusually optimistic
about the country these days.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.481
The better angels of our nature
are winning,

33:25.481 --> 33:27.048
just like
Lincoln predicted.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.572
He predicted that before
they shot him in the head.

33:29.572 --> 33:30.834
Oh, you're in
a dour mood.

33:30.834 --> 33:34.316
Well, I just
can't help it.

33:34.316 --> 33:37.493
I have this sense
of foreboding.

33:37.493 --> 33:39.539
I woke up with it.

33:39.539 --> 33:41.236
I think...

33:41.236 --> 33:43.934
I think it's because
every time

33:43.934 --> 33:46.763
we make progress
in this country,

33:46.763 --> 33:50.028
something bad happens
to set us back.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.508
See, that kind of thinking
isn't like you, Adam.

33:52.508 --> 33:54.684
You've got to keep
the faith, baby.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.941
Where the fuck is Harvey?
He should be here by now.

34:48.260 --> 34:49.957
Thank you, William.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.399
Betty and the girls
are already inside.

34:57.399 --> 34:58.748
- They're in the front row.
- Right.

34:58.748 --> 35:00.402
The big question is
whether those girls

35:00.402 --> 35:02.100
can sit still
for an hour.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.667
Right this way,
Brother Minister.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.974
There's a waiting room
in the corridor to the right.

35:06.974 --> 35:08.497
Thank you.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.329
Where are Chance
and Pettigrew?

35:19.204 --> 35:21.423
Pulling up on
the Audubon Ballroom on 165th.

35:21.423 --> 35:23.164
Yeah, let's park
a few blocks away.

35:23.164 --> 35:26.689
We'll hoof it in
with the others.

35:26.689 --> 35:29.431
Let's keep an eagle eye on every
motherfucker in that room.

35:29.431 --> 35:31.433
If anybody so as squints
at Malcolm,

35:31.433 --> 35:34.262
we'll take him
the fuck out, yeah?

35:34.262 --> 35:35.742
Damn skippy.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.880
Are you kidding me?

35:43.880 --> 35:45.491
The fuck is this shit?

36:00.332 --> 36:02.551
Get out of the car.

36:02.551 --> 36:04.249
Says who?

36:06.251 --> 36:08.557
Not gonna be making it
to the Audubon today.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.561
Who the fuck are you?
NYPD?

36:12.561 --> 36:14.476
Yeah, FBI?
CIA?

36:14.476 --> 36:16.174
Take your pick.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.393
Cuff 'em.

36:18.393 --> 36:20.352
- Hey.
- Wha-- Hey!

36:21.527 --> 36:24.094
Lobby's jammed.

36:24.094 --> 36:26.314
We set 400 chairs.

36:26.314 --> 36:28.011
Looks like a lot of people
are intersected

36:28.011 --> 36:29.230
in what you have
to say.

36:29.230 --> 36:31.189
That's good news.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.582
Reverend Galamison's wife
said he was ill.

36:33.582 --> 36:34.888
He had to cancel.

36:34.888 --> 36:36.585
That's strange.

36:36.585 --> 36:39.545
Brother Carlin canceled
this afternoon.

36:39.545 --> 36:41.111
I don't think you should
go out there.

36:41.111 --> 36:43.244
It'll be fine.

36:43.244 --> 36:48.075
Why don't you go and check
on Betty and the children?

36:48.075 --> 36:50.469
Everything will be fine.

37:08.356 --> 37:10.402
If you're not
letting us frisk...

37:13.405 --> 37:15.102
then at least
do this for me.

37:15.102 --> 37:16.451
- No, brother.
- It's small, Malcolm.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.236
You can affix it to the back
of your waistband.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.759
I won't carry a gun.

37:19.759 --> 37:23.589
I cannot guarantee the safety
of this auditorium.

37:27.593 --> 37:31.640
If you won't do it for me,
do it for Betty

37:31.640 --> 37:33.163
and your children.

37:58.754 --> 38:02.280
Girls, sit up straight.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.282
When's Daddy coming on?

38:04.282 --> 38:06.849
Soon, Attallah.

38:06.849 --> 38:09.199
Hello, Elise.

38:09.199 --> 38:11.158
Ooh, look at this place.

38:11.158 --> 38:13.334
It's filling up.

38:13.334 --> 38:15.293
All kinds of new faces here.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.600
Yes.
His message is spreading.

38:41.623 --> 38:43.321
It's Chin.

38:47.107 --> 38:49.892
Fucking Bumpy Johnson.

38:49.892 --> 38:51.154
The fuck is he doing here?

38:51.154 --> 38:52.982
- I don't know.
- I knew it.

38:52.982 --> 38:55.811
These motherfuckers
are up to something.

38:55.811 --> 38:57.813
I wanna kill
these motherfuckers.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.815
Hey, hey,
slow down, slow down.

38:59.815 --> 39:04.385
Jose, put the gun down.
You hear me?

39:04.385 --> 39:07.780
You <i>hablo ingles,</i> motherfucker?
Put the goddamn gun down.

39:10.957 --> 39:12.088
Get on the fucking ground.

39:12.088 --> 39:14.482
Jose-- Jose,
put the gun down.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.179
Where the fuck
is Bill Harvey?

39:16.179 --> 39:18.225
Tell me right now or I blow
your fucking heads off.

39:18.225 --> 39:21.663
Harvey went to the Feds.
We came here to warn you.

39:21.663 --> 39:23.186
You're a fucking liar!

39:23.186 --> 39:24.492
Jose! Stop it!

39:24.492 --> 39:26.407
Put the gun down!
You cannot pop a boss!

39:26.407 --> 39:27.843
Hey, fuck you, okay?

39:27.843 --> 39:29.889
I'll fucking kill
this motherfucker then.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.499
Where the fuck is he, Bumpy?
Look at me.

39:31.499 --> 39:34.067
One chance.
Where the fuck is Harvey?

39:34.067 --> 39:36.025
William Harvey
started with the FBI.

39:36.025 --> 39:37.679
He never really left them.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.202
He's selling us out, Jose.

39:39.202 --> 39:40.595
The Feds are coming here
any minute.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.249
I'm telling you right now.

39:42.249 --> 39:43.598
Harvey's with the FBI?!

39:43.598 --> 39:45.252
That's fucking bullshit.

39:50.257 --> 39:52.215
Bumpy, I told you
never fuck with me!

39:58.787 --> 40:01.224
- Get down! Hands up!
- Take 'em down.

40:07.274 --> 40:09.145
Alright, alright,
alright, alright.

40:09.145 --> 40:10.756
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

40:34.475 --> 40:35.563
Betty and the girls
are good?

40:35.563 --> 40:37.652
Yes.

40:37.652 --> 40:40.089
But there are some men out there
who give me the chills.

40:40.089 --> 40:41.874
I'm gonna go
out there.

40:44.311 --> 40:46.139
Best wishes,
Brother Minister.

40:46.139 --> 40:47.836
Thank you, Omar.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.849
I can't thank you enough for
everything you've done for me.

41:00.849 --> 41:02.503
And for our cause.

41:02.503 --> 41:04.462
We have a lot more to do.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.942
Yes, we do.

41:06.942 --> 41:08.509
Both of us.

41:11.817 --> 41:13.645
It's time.

41:13.645 --> 41:16.299
Brother Benjamin's making
the introductory remarks.

41:16.299 --> 41:17.910
Thank you.

41:20.260 --> 41:21.870
Malcolm, wait.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.384
Brothers and sisters,

41:57.384 --> 41:59.560
I will now introduce to you

41:59.560 --> 42:03.521
a man who would give his life
for his people.

42:35.727 --> 42:40.558
- As-Salaam Alaikum.
- Wa Alaikum Salaam.

43:02.449 --> 43:04.799
Hey, get your hand
out of my pocket!

43:04.799 --> 43:06.496
Hold-- Hold it, brother...

43:06.496 --> 43:07.889
Hold it! Hold it!

44:23.748 --> 44:26.054
They're killing my husband!

44:39.589 --> 44:41.548
No!

44:44.420 --> 44:46.292
No! No!

45:06.529 --> 45:10.490
He's gone.
He's gone.

45:12.666 --> 45:16.061
He's gone!
He's gone.

45:17.497 --> 45:22.415
Betty-- Betty, I have to take
the weapon away from him now.

45:22.415 --> 45:24.634
If the cops find it,
they'll say it was just

45:24.634 --> 45:28.377
two niggers in a gun fight
and they won't investigate.

45:33.600 --> 45:36.298
Betty, I'm-- I'm sorry.

45:39.649 --> 45:46.221
Why? Why?!

45:51.270 --> 45:56.057
Oh, Malcolm.
Oh, Malcolm.

46:18.993 --> 46:20.952
Ah.

46:23.650 --> 46:27.306
It was my understanding
that you'd lead me to Harvey.

46:27.306 --> 46:29.438
Instead, I got handed
a 50-inch belt

46:29.438 --> 46:32.659
and a pair of Florsheims
from the coroner.

46:32.659 --> 46:35.531
I heard he got drunk
on a roof and fell off.

46:35.531 --> 46:37.490
Yeah, he loves
his Cutty Sark.

46:37.490 --> 46:39.492
It affected his balance.

46:39.492 --> 46:41.102
Hmm.

46:41.102 --> 46:44.845
Well, that's cute.
Very cute.

46:44.845 --> 46:47.848
Which one's Abbott
and which one's Costello?

46:47.848 --> 46:49.545
Hmm?

46:49.545 --> 46:52.157
You expect me to believe
this shit when you say it?

46:52.157 --> 46:54.507
Aside from the shipment
you just seized,

46:54.507 --> 46:57.640
we helped you stop
an illegal CIA plot.

46:57.640 --> 47:01.035
If it goes public,
there'll be a shitstorm.

47:12.351 --> 47:14.353
Don't worry, boys.

47:14.353 --> 47:17.573
I'm keeping my end
of the bargain.

47:17.573 --> 47:20.315
But I promise you this.

47:20.315 --> 47:22.491
Next time I see you,

47:22.491 --> 47:25.712
you'll be doing your little
comedy routine from Rikers.

47:28.541 --> 47:31.849
Alright, uncuff them.
Let 'em go.

47:33.938 --> 47:36.723
Did you see
the look on Colombo's face

47:36.723 --> 47:38.333
when the Feds rolled up?

47:38.333 --> 47:42.337
That was fucking priceless,
let me tell you.

47:42.337 --> 47:44.339
You and I,
we own this town.

47:44.339 --> 47:45.775
Harlem's ours.

47:45.775 --> 47:47.603
I got what I wanted.

47:47.603 --> 47:50.084
That motherfucker
Harvey is dead,

47:50.084 --> 47:51.694
and Battle and Colombo,

47:51.694 --> 47:53.783
they won't be coming
after me or my family.

47:56.438 --> 48:00.181
I'm getting out
of narcotics.

48:00.181 --> 48:02.227
What are you
talking about?

48:02.227 --> 48:03.924
I'm making a change.

48:03.924 --> 48:05.230
What do you mean?

48:09.147 --> 48:12.106
Harlem is yours.

48:12.106 --> 48:13.803
<i>We interrupt this program</i>

48:13.803 --> 48:15.544
<i>for an important bulletin.</i>

48:15.544 --> 48:17.807
<i>A shooting has occurred
in Harlem's Audubon Ballroom.</i>

48:17.807 --> 48:19.461
<i>While giving a speech
to his followers,</i>

48:19.461 --> 48:22.290
<i>Malcolm X was shot dead
by unknown assailants...</i>

48:24.989 --> 48:26.425
<i>He said, "Stay cool,"
"Stay calm,"</i>

48:26.425 --> 48:29.036
<i>or something like that,
and, uh, just then,</i>

48:29.036 --> 48:31.082
<i>the gunfire went off,
and his-- his hand was up.</i>

48:31.082 --> 48:33.040
<i>I remember this.
I turned around quickly,</i>

48:33.040 --> 48:34.433
<i>and the next thing I saw was--</i>

48:34.433 --> 48:37.653
<i>was Malcolm falling back
in a dead faint.</i>

48:37.653 --> 48:40.743
<i>Um, right after that,
of course, like everybody else,</i>

48:40.743 --> 48:42.441
<i>you know, chairs
were being knocked over,</i>

48:42.441 --> 48:45.444
<i>there were screams, uh,
everybody was in a mad...</i>

48:45.444 --> 48:48.142
I-I need to go home now.

48:48.142 --> 48:49.927
I understand.

48:52.799 --> 48:55.497
My people need me.

48:55.497 --> 48:57.543
Your Nation needs you.

48:59.806 --> 49:01.939
J. Edgar Hoover
has informed me

49:01.939 --> 49:05.855
that suspects from a mosque
in New Jersey were responsible.

49:05.855 --> 49:07.074
Hoover said that?

49:07.074 --> 49:09.424
Well, then
it must be true.

49:09.424 --> 49:13.037
We need
to preach calm now, Adam.

49:14.081 --> 49:17.084
He was the brightest
and the best of us,

49:17.084 --> 49:20.174
so they shot him down.

49:20.174 --> 49:23.351
Didn't anybody
hear anything?

49:23.351 --> 49:26.311
How about the FBI?

49:26.311 --> 49:29.270
Hoover said they were taken
completely by surprise.

49:29.270 --> 49:31.316
Oh, now you know
that is bullshit.

49:33.492 --> 49:35.711
The truth will come out.

49:35.711 --> 49:39.324
Besides, we can't
bring him back.

49:42.849 --> 49:49.029
You can kill a man, Adam,
but not his ideas.

49:49.029 --> 49:51.162
They will live on.

49:51.162 --> 49:52.859
You'll see.

50:21.018 --> 50:23.585
I did what you said, Malcolm.

50:26.588 --> 50:28.460
Tried to do the right thing.

50:30.810 --> 50:32.638
That's what you wanted, right?

50:36.076 --> 50:39.079
Stubborn fool!

50:39.079 --> 50:42.735
Who's laying on the slab now,
you or me?

50:45.825 --> 50:48.567
I tried to protect you.

50:48.567 --> 50:50.569
Why wouldn't you let me?

50:52.919 --> 50:57.054
How am I supposed
to forgive myself for this?

51:09.936 --> 51:13.592
I promise you, Malcolm...

51:13.592 --> 51:17.683
one day, I'm gonna be the man
that you wanted me to be.

51:19.859 --> 51:25.473
May we all-- our people--
be who you wanted us to be.

51:28.607 --> 51:31.262
But this is hard to swallow.

51:35.483 --> 51:40.445
It's got its hand on my throat,
and it's--

51:40.445 --> 51:42.534
it's yanking me back in.

51:45.885 --> 51:49.671
So, I promise you
this, as well.

51:52.196 --> 51:56.330
Whatever forces put you here,

51:56.330 --> 51:59.507
I will have vengeance.
