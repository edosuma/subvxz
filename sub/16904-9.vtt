WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:05.034
Hey, what was that sound?
It was opportunity knocking.

00:05.102 --> 00:07.437
No one knocked.
You just barged in.

00:07.504 --> 00:09.272
- Knock knock.
- You were right, Donald.

00:09.339 --> 00:11.440
It makes more sense
for you to enter first.

00:11.508 --> 00:13.375
It's okay, daddy.
We'll just start over.

00:13.443 --> 00:15.544
Uh, you know,
why don't we just dive in

00:15.611 --> 00:17.243
to whatever this is?

00:17.310 --> 00:19.146
Okay, you remember Donald,

00:19.214 --> 00:21.165
my son who's two years older
than me.

00:21.233 --> 00:22.875
Ah, yes, please.

00:22.943 --> 00:26.560
As I recall, you own
the Tracy Jordan institute

00:26.628 --> 00:27.742
for black karate.

00:27.810 --> 00:28.906
You wouldn't believe this,

00:28.974 --> 00:30.422
but that business failed.

00:30.490 --> 00:31.702
I blame Obama.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.224
But the good news is,

00:33.292 --> 00:34.836
Donald has
a brand-new venture.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.319
Sell him, son.

00:36.387 --> 00:39.241
It's a theme restaurant
in Times Square.

00:39.309 --> 00:41.721
Well, the theme restaurant
business model does work.

00:41.789 --> 00:44.606
Nascar's fat load cafe
is a gold mine.

00:44.674 --> 00:45.946
Well, we got a bunch of capital

00:46.019 --> 00:47.624
from Brown and Folderson.

00:47.691 --> 00:50.139
And we wanted to get you a seat
on this rocket

00:50.207 --> 00:51.945
before it takes off.

00:52.013 --> 00:54.826
So it's decided.
Jack's on board as an investor.

00:54.894 --> 00:56.369
Ah, not so fast.

00:56.436 --> 00:59.781
So...it's...decid...

00:59.849 --> 01:02.529
Uh, let's just bottom-line
this thing.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.339
I never invest without doing
my research.

01:04.406 --> 01:07.150
I'll do a site visit tonight
and kick the tires.

01:07.218 --> 01:09.891
All right, but if some other
investor comes along,

01:09.959 --> 01:12.201
it's your loss.

01:12.269 --> 01:14.676
A Mexican billionaire's
calling me right now.

01:14.743 --> 01:16.013
Excuse me.

01:16.081 --> 01:19.694
<i>Senior Mexico, uh, si si.
Yo soy Donald, si.</i>

01:19.762 --> 01:22.770
<i>Andale andale?
Arriba arriba?</i>

01:22.838 --> 01:24.644
What is senior Mexico saying?

01:24.712 --> 01:26.652
Stop keeping me out
of the loop!

01:46.517 --> 01:47.652
Hey, Jenna,
I need to go over...

01:47.720 --> 01:49.524
Gah!

01:49.592 --> 01:52.266
- Snuh!
- What is it, Liz? We're busy.

01:52.334 --> 01:53.602
Jenna and I are mirroring

01:53.670 --> 01:56.408
until we achieve
touchless orgasm.

01:56.476 --> 01:59.482
And...Finished.

01:59.549 --> 02:01.586
- Agh.
- Well, I have to go to work.

02:01.654 --> 02:04.428
My new manager
is making us wear nametags.

02:04.495 --> 02:05.564
I might as well be working

02:05.632 --> 02:07.167
at a roller-skating drag queen
restaurant

02:07.237 --> 02:08.371
under Taliban rule.

02:08.439 --> 02:09.506
But after your shift,

02:09.574 --> 02:11.244
we still have
our special night, right?

02:11.311 --> 02:13.749
You have no idea how special.

02:15.420 --> 02:18.024
Ugh.

02:18.092 --> 02:21.800
Oh. We're celebrating
our six-month anniversary

02:21.867 --> 02:24.639
and I think Paul is going
to pop the question.

02:24.707 --> 02:26.910
Really? That's a little fast,
isn't it?

02:26.978 --> 02:29.483
I will say yes
when Paul proposes...

02:29.551 --> 02:32.623
That we make a sex tape
and leak it on the Internet.

02:32.690 --> 02:34.827
Oh, I thought
you meant marriage.

02:34.895 --> 02:38.100
God, no.
Marriage is like death.

02:38.168 --> 02:40.807
You settle into a routine.
You lose all the spark.

02:40.875 --> 02:41.875
I don't know.

02:41.943 --> 02:43.144
I always thought
the whole point

02:43.211 --> 02:44.681
of being with someone
for a long time

02:44.748 --> 02:46.817
is to get to the comfortable
routine part.

02:46.885 --> 02:49.822
No. Relationships
are like sharks, Liz.

02:49.890 --> 02:51.425
If you're not left
with several bite marks

02:51.493 --> 02:53.696
after intercourse,
then something's wrong.

02:53.764 --> 02:55.366
Well, nothing's wrong
with me and Carol.

02:55.434 --> 02:56.868
I mean, we haven't spoken
in five days,

02:56.936 --> 02:59.273
but that doesn't mean anything
because we are not sharks.

02:59.341 --> 03:02.679
We are legless turtles
rotting on the beach.

03:05.118 --> 03:09.792
Jack, what makes a guy get bored
in a dating situation?

03:09.860 --> 03:10.828
That's an excellent question.

03:10.895 --> 03:12.831
The answer is
questions like that.

03:12.899 --> 03:14.901
Look, this long distance
is hard.

03:14.969 --> 03:16.170
And now Carol and I
haven't talked

03:16.238 --> 03:17.406
in, like, five days

03:17.474 --> 03:20.378
and my other stuff
is still unresolved.

03:20.446 --> 03:23.483
I get it, Lemon.
You need to see a therapist.

03:23.551 --> 03:25.921
Someone you can dump
your problems on

03:25.989 --> 03:29.160
and then get on
with your, uh, "life."

03:29.228 --> 03:31.732
Ugh. I'm trying. I just can't
find someone I like.

03:31.799 --> 03:33.902
I mean, have you ever been
to a shrink?

03:33.969 --> 03:35.571
No. I believe
that when you have a problem,

03:35.639 --> 03:36.773
you talk it over
with your priest,

03:36.841 --> 03:38.810
or your tailor,
or the mute elevator porter

03:38.877 --> 03:40.045
at your men's club.

03:40.113 --> 03:42.182
<i>Then you take that problem
and crush it</i>

03:42.249 --> 03:43.384
with your mind vice.

03:43.452 --> 03:46.222
But for lesser beings
like curly-haired men

03:46.289 --> 03:47.391
and people who need glasses,

03:47.458 --> 03:48.726
therapy can help.

03:48.794 --> 03:51.564
And, Lemon, I want you
to get better

03:51.632 --> 03:53.768
because... and I mean this...

03:53.836 --> 03:55.738
I'm tired of talking this much
to a woman

03:55.806 --> 03:58.375
I'm not having sex with.

04:00.446 --> 04:04.585
Hey, Jack.
Welcome to Staples.

04:04.653 --> 04:06.588
Why did you choose that name?

04:06.656 --> 04:09.091
Because staples
means "the basics."

04:09.159 --> 04:10.727
And that's
what you're getting here.

04:10.795 --> 04:14.897
Food, drinks, fun. Staples.
Yeah, we got that.

04:14.965 --> 04:18.166
Staples is also a giant
office supply chain.

04:18.233 --> 04:21.468
Well, we'll see who's still
in business 200 years from now.

04:21.535 --> 04:22.802
Come on.

04:22.870 --> 04:25.470
Donald, I'm going
to pick a problem at random.

04:25.538 --> 04:28.405
Is the theme of your restaurant
"not enough tables"?

04:28.473 --> 04:30.006
No. We just need
a lot of room

04:30.074 --> 04:31.340
for the monster fight.

04:31.408 --> 04:32.407
Excuse me?

04:32.475 --> 04:33.808
Jack, are you familiar

04:33.876 --> 04:36.477
with the megarestaurant
medieval times?

04:36.545 --> 04:39.413
Well, I took that model
and replaced the knights

04:39.480 --> 04:43.083
with unlicensed versions
of Japanese monsters.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.418
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:45.486 --> 04:48.988
there's been an underwater
nuclear explosion.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.990
A beast has been awakened.

04:51.057 --> 04:54.159

with fearsome steps.

Boom boom boom.

05:19.412 --> 05:24.481
Thank you for choosing staples.

05:24.549 --> 05:28.349
Ah! Donald,
George punched my crotch.

05:28.417 --> 05:31.119
You liked it.

05:31.186 --> 05:32.486

Captain Burnett

05:36.289 --> 05:37.556
called earlier, miss Lemon.

05:37.624 --> 05:38.757
Finally.
Not that it matters.

05:38.825 --> 05:40.025
We're turtles.

05:40.093 --> 05:41.693
He said he doesn't
have cell phone service

05:41.761 --> 05:44.295
'cause he's on layover
in Daytona Beach.

05:44.363 --> 05:47.031
But don't worry, he's fine
and having a great time

05:47.098 --> 05:48.298
with his flight crew.

05:48.366 --> 05:51.968
Uh, Stewart, Brenda,
Amber, Crystal.

05:52.036 --> 05:53.970
Also in the background,
I heard lady giggles

05:54.037 --> 05:57.573
and the sound
of a beautiful sunset.

05:57.641 --> 06:00.208
See, this is why I need
to find someone to talk to.

06:00.276 --> 06:03.545
- Talk to about what?
- Men. Trust.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.380
I mean, I just feel like
sometimes men

06:05.448 --> 06:07.082
aren't totally honest with me.

06:07.149 --> 06:10.885
Hmm. Go on.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.053
Well, for starters,

06:12.121 --> 06:13.655
everyone I ever dated
in high school

06:13.722 --> 06:14.989
turned out to be either gay

06:15.056 --> 06:16.323
or a girl dressed as a guy

06:16.390 --> 06:17.991
to get a journalism
scholarship.

06:18.058 --> 06:20.659
My own dad tried to secretly
cheat on my mom.

06:20.727 --> 06:23.328
And I thought their marriage
was perfect.

06:23.396 --> 06:26.231
Then, of course,
there's Santa Claus.

06:26.299 --> 06:28.166
Okay. Talk about that.

06:28.234 --> 06:29.233
When I was seven,

06:29.301 --> 06:31.301
I asked for a CB radio
for Christmas

06:31.369 --> 06:33.503
so I could track gas prices
around the state

06:33.571 --> 06:35.206
for a cool chart
that I was making.

06:35.274 --> 06:36.741
We'll get back to that later.

06:36.809 --> 06:37.742
When I didn't get it,

06:37.810 --> 06:39.343
my dad blamed Santa Claus.

06:39.411 --> 06:42.913
Well, Santa made an enemy
that day.

06:42.981 --> 06:44.447
And the next year
when he returned

06:44.515 --> 06:47.718
to the Schuylkill galleria,
so did vengeance.

06:47.785 --> 06:51.755
Ho ho ho. What can Santa
bring you this year?

06:51.823 --> 06:53.090
What does it matter?

06:53.157 --> 06:55.259
You didn't bring me
what I asked for last year,

06:55.327 --> 06:57.127
you fat fraud.

06:57.195 --> 06:59.763

than our current president

07:04.001 --> 07:05.434
My wife still thinks
I work at the bank.

07:05.501 --> 07:07.367
I guess Santa Claus
was the first man

07:07.435 --> 07:08.869
to ever betray me.

07:08.936 --> 07:11.070
That must've been difficult.

07:11.138 --> 07:13.906
It was.

07:13.974 --> 07:16.675
But it feels good
to talk about it.

07:16.743 --> 07:17.710
Thanks.

07:17.777 --> 07:18.777
Miss Lemon,

07:18.845 --> 07:20.145
there's a reason
God gave us two ears

07:20.212 --> 07:21.612
and only one mouth.

07:21.680 --> 07:25.481
Listening is twice as important
as talking.

07:25.549 --> 07:27.950
But he gave us ten fingers.

07:28.018 --> 07:30.486
He must really want us
to poke things.

07:32.388 --> 07:34.756
- Oh.
- Poke poke poke poke.

face kiss.

07:48.134 --> 07:52.103
Jenna, what we have
is so beautiful.

07:52.170 --> 07:55.038
People need to see how happy
we make each other.

07:55.106 --> 07:56.974
And I think we're ready
to take that step.

07:57.042 --> 08:00.644
So over Christmas,
I want you to come to Ohio

08:00.711 --> 08:02.144
and meet my parents.

08:02.212 --> 08:07.149
- What?
- Happy anniversary.

08:07.217 --> 08:10.318
Hey, get a room!
Whatever that is.

08:12.988 --> 08:15.189
Well, Tracy, I went
to the restaurant last night.

08:15.257 --> 08:16.490
That place is a disaster.

08:16.558 --> 08:18.558
Damn it, you think
I don't know that?

08:18.626 --> 08:20.727
I've poured more cash
into Donald's restaurant

08:20.795 --> 08:22.662
than my money pit
in Connecticut.

08:22.730 --> 08:24.330
You have a house
in Connecticut?

08:24.397 --> 08:26.765
No, I do not.

08:26.833 --> 08:29.701
Jack, I need other investors
besides me.

08:29.769 --> 08:32.169
What? You're the only one
bankrolling this?

08:32.238 --> 08:33.871
What about Brown and Folderson?

08:33.938 --> 08:35.339
That's what I call my wallet.

08:35.407 --> 08:38.207
I've bankrolled every one
of Donald's dumb ideas.

08:38.275 --> 08:40.977
But what choice do I have?
I'm his father.

08:41.044 --> 08:42.645
But you're doing him no favors

08:42.714 --> 08:45.949
as a business partner
or a father.

08:46.016 --> 08:47.783
You need to cut him off.

08:47.851 --> 08:50.619
Come on.
The boy's only 43 years old.

08:50.686 --> 08:51.786
Tracy, listen to me,

08:51.854 --> 08:53.954
not everyone is cut out
to be a businessman.

08:54.022 --> 08:57.525
For example, curly-haired men
and people who need glasses.

08:57.592 --> 08:59.193
But I can't crush his dreams.

08:59.260 --> 09:00.727
You're not.
You're just letting him fly

09:00.795 --> 09:02.062
with his own wings.

09:02.130 --> 09:03.330
I bankrolled that too.

09:03.398 --> 09:07.633
Thank God we tested it
with a monkey first.

09:07.701 --> 09:09.802
Oh, miss Lemon,
I'm signing people up

09:09.869 --> 09:11.570

09:11.638 --> 09:13.171
So far I have eight nos

09:13.239 --> 09:15.573
and 25 shove it up
your goon-holes.

09:15.641 --> 09:17.708
- Shove it up your goon-hole.
- Okay.

09:17.776 --> 09:20.110
You know, ever since we had
our little talk yesterday,

09:20.178 --> 09:21.878
I've been doing some thinking.

09:21.946 --> 09:23.045
Oh, good.

09:23.113 --> 09:24.480
If I remember correctly,

09:24.547 --> 09:26.815
we were discussing men
and trust.

09:26.883 --> 09:30.084
Yeah. And it got me thinking
about my aunt Linda.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.720
- What was she like?
- Great until she got divorced.

09:32.788 --> 09:34.421
My Uncle Harry
was cheating on her.

09:34.489 --> 09:37.323
Another male betrayal.
Go with that.

09:37.391 --> 09:39.525
My parents used to make me go
to Linda's house

09:39.593 --> 09:41.060
just so she'd have company.

09:41.128 --> 09:42.728
I hated those visits.

09:42.796 --> 09:45.130
Your uncle never liked
my cooking.

09:45.198 --> 09:47.132
But you do, right, Elizabeth?

09:47.199 --> 09:49.400
You love your aunt Linda.

09:49.468 --> 09:51.102
Here's a fun game:

09:51.170 --> 09:52.503
Put on Harry's cologne

09:52.571 --> 09:54.605
and give me a backrub
in the bath.

09:54.673 --> 09:56.540
[Laughs]

09:56.608 --> 09:59.576
[Cries]

09:59.644 --> 10:02.110
To this day, whenever I hear
someone's getting divorced,

10:02.178 --> 10:05.846
I can still taste that egg
and I...

10:05.914 --> 10:07.347
Oh, my God.

10:07.415 --> 10:08.748
My trust issues
and my food issues

10:08.816 --> 10:10.049
are connected.

10:10.116 --> 10:11.917
Uncle Harold is the reason

10:11.984 --> 10:13.184
eggs make me gag.

10:13.252 --> 10:15.454
Kenneth,
you're the perfect therapist.

10:15.521 --> 10:17.455
I can dump
all of my problems on you,

10:17.523 --> 10:20.424
walk away, and move on
with my life.

10:20.492 --> 10:25.762
It's a win-win.

10:25.830 --> 10:29.198
Why did she have
to say "Harold"?

10:31.201 --> 10:33.402
Liz.

10:33.470 --> 10:34.636
Last night was a disaster.

10:34.704 --> 10:35.671
And not the good kind

10:35.739 --> 10:36.939
where I get to sing
at a benefit.

10:37.006 --> 10:38.206
What happened?

10:38.274 --> 10:39.640
Paul's idea
of moving things forward

10:39.708 --> 10:41.341
is me meeting his parents.

10:41.409 --> 10:43.944
He said they live
in a "soo-borb."

10:44.011 --> 10:46.146
Suburb. Come on, Jenna.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.814
It's not what you wanted,
but it's progress.

10:47.882 --> 10:49.548
In the wrong direction.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.382
I think I know
what's really going on

10:51.450 --> 10:52.583
between you and Paul.

10:52.650 --> 10:53.583
You're in love

10:53.651 --> 10:55.084
and it's terrifying to you.

10:55.152 --> 10:57.085
You're trying to sabotage it.

10:57.153 --> 10:58.686
Sabotage?

10:58.754 --> 11:01.455
I'm the one trying to make
this relationship work.

11:01.523 --> 11:03.457
Which is why I'm gonna have
to be the one

11:03.525 --> 11:06.095
to propose the sex tape.

11:06.162 --> 11:07.262
Call me old-fashioned,

11:07.330 --> 11:09.664
but I think
that's the man's job.

11:09.732 --> 11:11.566
Jack, I found a therapist
and I've made

11:11.634 --> 11:13.935
some big breakthroughs.

11:14.003 --> 11:15.270
I know you don't know
what this means,

11:15.337 --> 11:16.904
but I'm eating eggs again.

11:16.972 --> 11:19.140
I know it means
this conversation is disgusting.

11:19.207 --> 11:21.141
[Laughs]

11:21.209 --> 11:24.544
Okay, Donald is on his way up.

11:24.612 --> 11:26.479
I know cutting him off is hard,

11:26.547 --> 11:27.714
but it's your duty
as a parent...

11:27.781 --> 11:28.881
[laughs]

11:28.949 --> 11:30.783
Tracy, do not laugh
at the word "duty."

11:30.850 --> 11:34.419
Be strong. Be rational.
[Inhales] No emotion.

11:34.487 --> 11:37.488
- Unemotional. Got it.
- Daddy, what's going on?

11:37.556 --> 11:39.256
[Crying] I just love you
so much!

11:39.324 --> 11:41.124
I love you too, daddy.

11:41.192 --> 11:44.126
[Both bawling]

11:44.194 --> 11:45.528
Okay, stop it.

11:45.595 --> 11:46.929
Donald, what Tracy
is trying to tell you

11:46.997 --> 11:48.197
is that you're an adult

11:48.265 --> 11:51.166
and he will no longer
support you financially.

11:51.233 --> 11:52.500
Is that true, daddy?

11:52.568 --> 11:54.836
For the love of God,
stop calling him "daddy."

11:54.903 --> 11:56.303
It is true, little man.

11:56.371 --> 11:58.805
But I need you
to be a big boy on this.

11:58.873 --> 12:00.841
You're just not meant
to be a businessman.

12:00.908 --> 12:03.442
Fine. I'll be okay.

12:03.510 --> 12:04.911
I got other ideas.

12:04.978 --> 12:08.246
Like a microbrewery
that also serves frozen yogurt.

12:08.314 --> 12:11.315
I'm gonna call it
"Microsoft."

12:15.854 --> 12:17.354
I have this recurring dream.

12:17.421 --> 12:19.288
Actually, is it recurring
if you wake yourself up

12:19.356 --> 12:21.891
with a [snorts]
and then return to it?

12:21.958 --> 12:24.359
Anyway, in the dream,
I'm a baby.

12:24.427 --> 12:29.697
[Voice echoing]

12:29.765 --> 12:33.533
I think it has to do
with my issues with sex.

12:33.601 --> 12:36.869
<i>Lemon, what are you doing?
Is Kenneth your therapist?</i>

12:36.937 --> 12:40.305
- Well, kind of.
- He can't handle that.

12:40.372 --> 12:42.774
Look at his head shape.
He has no brain pan!

12:42.841 --> 12:45.476
It's fine, Mr. Donaghy.
I'm okay.

12:45.544 --> 12:48.378
[High-pitched voice]
And so am I. I'm Cheryl.

12:48.446 --> 12:53.149
This is exactly why I told you
to see a professional.

12:53.217 --> 12:56.051
You dump your problems
on some half-baked Barney fife

12:56.119 --> 12:57.319
and you can start
a chain reaction

12:57.387 --> 13:00.155
of mental anguish.

13:00.223 --> 13:01.723
Look what you've done to him.

13:01.791 --> 13:06.360
But he's such a good listener
and he takes my insurance.

13:06.427 --> 13:11.631
I'm going to help you.
Lie down.

13:11.698 --> 13:14.366
Put your mental burden
in my mind vice

13:14.434 --> 13:15.367
and I will crush it.

13:15.435 --> 13:17.702
Kenneth, who is Harold?

13:17.770 --> 13:22.539
He...Was a role model
of mine growing up.

13:22.607 --> 13:24.207
[Whispers]
Please let Harold be human.

13:24.274 --> 13:25.875
Harold was a pig.

13:25.943 --> 13:30.245
You see, my father passed
when I was just a young boy.

13:30.312 --> 13:34.282
After that, I was alone a lot
and awful sad.

13:34.349 --> 13:36.917
But that pig saved me.

13:36.985 --> 13:38.251
In some ways,

13:38.319 --> 13:41.087
Harold was the only thing I had

13:41.155 --> 13:42.355
that was like a father.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.423
You had a void to fill.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.457
Continue.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.792
Then one day,

13:46.860 --> 13:50.228
my mama told me
we had to sell him.

13:50.295 --> 13:52.329
I knew what that meant.

13:52.397 --> 13:54.398
Harold was off
to the slaughterhouse.

13:54.466 --> 13:56.966
- I know it's difficult...
- I'm not done, sir.

13:57.034 --> 13:58.234
It gets worse.

13:58.302 --> 13:59.735
With Harold gone,

13:59.803 --> 14:02.205
there was nothing keeping me
at home.

14:02.273 --> 14:04.207
It was time for me to move
to New York

14:04.274 --> 14:06.175
and follow my dreams.

14:06.243 --> 14:08.710
But I needed $300

14:08.778 --> 14:12.980
for the river ferry-
train-ox cart-train-bus ticket.

14:13.048 --> 14:15.382
And that's when I saw the sign.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.652
I knew I could win
that contest.

14:17.719 --> 14:19.787
Heck, I'd once eaten
an entire witch.

14:19.855 --> 14:21.688
A pig was nothing.

14:21.756 --> 14:24.290
And then they brought me mine.

14:24.357 --> 14:29.661
I would have recognized
those eyes anywhere.

14:29.729 --> 14:32.062
- Kenneth, no.
- It was Harold.

14:32.130 --> 14:36.966
And I ate all of him.
Even the face in case of a tie.

14:37.034 --> 14:39.636
- Good God!
- I ate him, sir!

14:39.703 --> 14:42.271
I ate my father pig!

14:42.339 --> 14:44.940
[Whimpers and squeals]

14:45.007 --> 14:49.343
Okay! Or you gave
his death meaning.

14:49.411 --> 14:52.479
His sacrifice made you
what you are today,

14:52.547 --> 14:55.982
which is the lowest-level
employee

14:56.050 --> 15:01.253
at the last-place network
in America.

15:01.321 --> 15:04.055
I guess that is true.
Thank you, sir.

15:04.123 --> 15:06.724
I'll think on that.

15:06.792 --> 15:10.060
And you're sure you're okay
hearing about all my problems?

15:10.128 --> 15:12.529
Of course, I'm Jack Donaghy.

15:12.596 --> 15:15.531
[Exhales]

15:20.303 --> 15:22.737
Oh, no. Crush it.

15:22.805 --> 15:25.806
Oh, God, here comes
my childhood!

15:25.874 --> 15:28.642
[Cries]

15:33.017 --> 15:34.517
I'm in here, Paul!

15:34.585 --> 15:35.885
The restaurant was crazy today.

15:35.953 --> 15:37.987
During nude hour, I got custard

15:38.055 --> 15:40.022
all over my penis.

15:40.090 --> 15:41.757
What's going on in here?

15:41.824 --> 15:44.225
You want to take this
to the next level?

15:44.293 --> 15:46.460
Let's videotape our lovemaking,

15:46.528 --> 15:50.196
pretend the tape got stolen,
and let the whole world see.

15:50.263 --> 15:52.130
Wow.
I don't know, Jenna.

15:52.198 --> 15:55.433
- I'm pretty beat.
- I see.

15:55.501 --> 15:59.271
Fine. I guess we're just done
having any adventure

15:59.338 --> 16:00.672
or excitement in our lives.

16:00.739 --> 16:02.974
God. Well, jeez, I'm sorry
that I'm happy

16:03.041 --> 16:04.575
with the way things are.

16:04.643 --> 16:07.043
Come on, why can't we just
paint each other's toenails,

16:07.111 --> 16:08.344
watch vintage pornography,

16:08.412 --> 16:10.745
and then go to bed in our swing
like a normal couple?

16:10.813 --> 16:14.080
Because it's boring.

16:14.148 --> 16:15.581
We might as well be married...

16:15.649 --> 16:17.783
Okay, this isn't about us
being adventurous.

16:17.850 --> 16:20.252
This is about you being afraid
to settle down with me.

16:20.319 --> 16:22.721
- That's not true.
- Fine. Let's do this tape.

16:22.788 --> 16:24.422
But then what?
What will you want next?

16:24.490 --> 16:26.056
Well, there's a sex resort
in Japan

16:26.124 --> 16:28.025
where white people
are treated like slaves.

16:28.092 --> 16:29.259
No, Jenna!

16:29.327 --> 16:30.427
You're making it impossible

16:30.495 --> 16:32.395
to live up
to your expectations.

16:32.463 --> 16:33.562
What are you saying?

16:33.630 --> 16:35.563
I'm saying adopting a dog

16:35.631 --> 16:37.298
so it can watch us make love

16:37.366 --> 16:39.134
and then returning it
claiming that it bit

16:39.202 --> 16:42.470
our imaginary child
is everything that I need.

16:42.538 --> 16:44.572
But if that's really not enough
for you,

16:44.640 --> 16:48.742
tell me now.

16:48.810 --> 16:53.745
- I'm sorry.
- Very well.

16:53.813 --> 16:58.682
I'm not going to beg you.
I have my dignity.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.953
I trust you to fairly divide up
our panties.

17:02.020 --> 17:06.324
I'll come get them tomorrow
while you're at work.

17:10.862 --> 17:12.396
Oh, miss Lemon,
I have another message

17:12.464 --> 17:13.797
from Captain Burnett.

17:13.865 --> 17:15.365
Please don't get sad,
and remember things,

17:15.433 --> 17:16.433
and infect me again.

17:16.501 --> 17:17.601
Kenneth, it's okay.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.102
I'm not worried
about Carol anymore.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.869
I'm just sorry I messed you up
like that.

17:20.938 --> 17:24.105
Don't worry. I had my brain
cleaned by Mr. Donaghy.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.540
Oh, I told him everything.
How Harold was...

17:26.607 --> 17:27.808
No, no!
Don't tell me your story!

17:27.875 --> 17:30.610
I can't handle it.
Look how small my head is.

17:30.678 --> 17:33.846
Oh, my! So tiny.

17:37.884 --> 17:40.252
Daddy, I wanted to give you
your share of our profits

17:40.319 --> 17:42.987
before I shut down my dream.

17:43.055 --> 17:47.924
Someone left it in coat check.

17:47.992 --> 17:50.992
Tracy, listen to me.
I was wrong.

17:51.060 --> 17:53.194
Don't turn your back on Donald.

17:53.262 --> 17:55.229
Too late.
Look how we're positioned.

17:55.297 --> 17:57.231
Kenneth told me
a story earlier...

17:57.299 --> 17:58.632
a story about fathers and sons.

17:58.699 --> 18:00.033
And despite my best effort,

18:00.101 --> 18:02.802
it unearthed a memory
from my own childhood.

18:02.870 --> 18:05.304
As a boy, I wanted to be
an astronaut,

18:05.372 --> 18:07.973
or a deep-sea diver,
a man of science.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.475
But I was raised
by Jimmy Donaghy,

18:10.542 --> 18:13.243
a man who projected his own
failed dreams

18:13.311 --> 18:15.312
on to his family.

18:15.379 --> 18:16.580
When I was in third grade,

18:16.647 --> 18:18.348
my class put on a science play.

18:18.415 --> 18:20.316
The night before,
Jimmy came home drunk

18:20.384 --> 18:21.984
and found me rehearsing
my lines.

18:22.052 --> 18:24.487
I was struggling
with the science terms.

18:24.554 --> 18:28.223
And Jimmy laughed and said
"well, looky here.

18:28.291 --> 18:30.692
"Dr. Jack. The boy wants
to be a scientist.

18:30.759 --> 18:32.860
"Chowderhead
can't even say the words!

18:32.927 --> 18:35.328
You'll never be nothing!"

18:35.396 --> 18:38.597
The next day,
I was up on that stage.

18:38.665 --> 18:41.633
I looked out at the audience,
I saw Jimmy, and I froze.

18:41.701 --> 18:44.269
I am a protoin.
Protein!

18:44.337 --> 18:47.905
All living orgasms...
I mean orgasms.

18:47.973 --> 18:50.241
Chowderhead
can't even say the words.

18:50.309 --> 18:53.411
When I got home,
I threw away my microscope,

18:53.479 --> 18:57.648
my shell collection,
my map of the stars.

18:57.715 --> 18:59.416
[Coughs] Nerd.

18:59.484 --> 19:02.151
A parent is the one person
who is supposed

19:02.219 --> 19:04.653
to make their kid think
they can do anything.

19:04.721 --> 19:07.489
Says they're beautiful
even when they're ugly.

19:07.557 --> 19:10.892
Thinks they're smart even when
they go to Arizona state.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.394
Let the rest of the world
tear your kid down.

19:13.462 --> 19:16.663
Your job is to support him
no matter what.

19:16.730 --> 19:21.034
Tracy believes you, Donald.
Go and make him proud.

19:21.102 --> 19:23.035
That's a nice, long speech
and all,

19:23.103 --> 19:24.537
but your daddy was right.

19:24.604 --> 19:26.138
You couldn't be a scientist.

19:26.205 --> 19:29.073
You could even be protein
in a school play.

19:29.141 --> 19:32.410
And I can't run a business.
I'm a failure.

19:36.548 --> 19:39.949
I...

19:40.017 --> 19:42.918
Am a protein!

19:42.986 --> 19:47.922
All living organisms
need me to function.

19:47.990 --> 19:51.592
A basic building block
of the human body.

19:51.660 --> 19:55.929
I'm made from amino acids
found in ribosomes.

19:55.997 --> 19:58.865
Proteins give energy
to everything

19:58.933 --> 20:00.866
from flowers and butterflies

20:00.934 --> 20:06.605
to heroes who turn in
communists.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.007
I am a protein.

20:12.811 --> 20:16.146
Daddy, can I have $50,000
to start a business

20:16.214 --> 20:18.615
where people can call in
and get air quality reports

20:18.683 --> 20:20.883
from all across
the United States?

20:20.951 --> 20:22.651
- I'm gonna call it...
- Donald, no.

20:22.719 --> 20:28.156
- American airlines.
- And it's going to work, son!

20:28.224 --> 20:34.026

20:34.064 --> 20:35.931
This is what happens
when you work at being happy.

20:36.499 --> 20:38.066
Godzilla sits next to you
while you're eating

20:38.634 --> 20:40.034
an egg salad sandwich.

20:40.102 --> 20:42.503
- What a world.
- What's the point?

20:42.571 --> 20:44.237
I moved here to make it
to Broadway.

20:44.305 --> 20:46.573
Now look at me.
I'm pathetic.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.909
I've got no real skills.
A degree in theater tech.

20:49.977 --> 20:51.310
So you move back
to Pennsylvania.

20:51.378 --> 20:52.978
Live with your parents.

20:53.046 --> 20:54.646
All of your old friends
have kids and careers.

20:54.714 --> 20:55.914
And what do you have?

20:55.982 --> 20:57.516
Maybe your name on a TV show

20:57.584 --> 20:59.051
that no one will even remember.

20:59.119 --> 21:00.586
I should've moved to Cleveland
with that guy

21:00.654 --> 21:04.223
when I had the chance.

21:04.291 --> 21:05.791
<i>Damn you, Gojira!</i>
