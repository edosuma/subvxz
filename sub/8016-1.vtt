00:30.390 --> 00:32.698
You're on WMPW Bard College radio.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.234
Guys, why don't you introduce
yourselves to our listeners?

00:35.236 --> 00:37.036
My name's
Travis, I play guitar.

00:37.038 --> 00:38.670
I'm Barry,
I play the drums.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.339
My name is
Anna and I sing.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.740
So tell me.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.308
How did the band meet?

00:43.310 --> 00:46.111
I closed my eyes and
I imagined this ray of light.

00:46.113 --> 00:47.279
Shut up.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.380
Well, believe
it or not, we

00:48.382 --> 00:50.149
were all born in the same week.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.718
So Travis and I were really
drunk celebrating our birthday.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.821
And we run-- we run into
Anna really drunk celebrating

00:55.823 --> 00:56.588
her birthday.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.123
So wasted.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.691
Improvising
song after song.

00:59.693 --> 01:00.926
Yes.

01:00.928 --> 01:01.960
So, um, where do you

01:01.962 --> 01:03.328
see yourselves down the road?

01:03.330 --> 01:04.863
Where do you see yourselves
10 years from now?

01:04.864 --> 01:06.932
Uh, I really think we
keep doing what we're doing.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.467
Working hard, making
the right choices,

01:08.469 --> 01:10.369
and we'll be doing huge
things in 10 years.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.671
I
feel like we're on a path.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.274
If it has some twists
and turns or whatever,

01:15.276 --> 01:16.608
we're gonna make it happen.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.410
Wait, I got your
crystal ball right here.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.646
It says the road
we're on continues.

01:20.648 --> 01:23.449
We'll either be famous or dead.

01:39.466 --> 01:42.167
It'd been
six years since any of us

01:42.169 --> 01:43.635
had seen one another.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.472
Me and Travis and Anna.

01:46.474 --> 01:49.508
We all went our
separate ways, but I

01:49.510 --> 01:52.644
promised Travis we'd spend
our 30th birthdays together.

02:00.653 --> 02:04.089
For the last week my wife been
asking why I travelled halfway

02:04.091 --> 02:07.526
across the country to see
this guy that I hated.

02:07.528 --> 02:12.898
The truth is, I've
never loved anyone more.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.266
For whatever reason
our band really

02:14.268 --> 02:15.534
meant something to people.

02:15.536 --> 02:18.170
I mean, we had fans.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.139
But in the end it
didn't work out,

02:20.141 --> 02:22.708
and I always felt a little
bit guilty about that.

02:29.749 --> 02:32.951
If I had known Anna was
gonna be here this weekend,

02:32.953 --> 02:34.253
I never would have come.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.321
Are you guys, uh,
rekindling your thing?

02:36.323 --> 02:38.290
We never
had a thing, man.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.892
-So let me guess.

02:39.894 --> 02:41.059
She knows I'm coming?

02:41.061 --> 02:42.461
-Yeah.

02:42.463 --> 02:43.128
Who cares?

02:43.130 --> 02:43.862
-Brilliant.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.464
-Let it go.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.765
Be here.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.600
You look good here.

02:48.602 --> 02:52.137
She'd gone
on to make something of herself.

02:52.139 --> 02:54.773
She was a star in
Europe and in Asia.

02:54.775 --> 02:59.311
But to me, she was just
the one who got away.

03:02.649 --> 03:03.248
Anyway.

03:12.859 --> 03:13.525
- Wow.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.633
So
why did I come back?

03:21.635 --> 03:25.971
Maybe I just needed to
prove to myself I could.

03:25.973 --> 03:29.474
Maybe it's because
I made a promise.

03:29.476 --> 03:32.678
Or maybe I was hoping to get
a glimpse of the magic again.

03:42.422 --> 03:44.323
You look good.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.357
You look damn good.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.125
You uh, you lost some weight.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.260
-Yeah.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.728
Yeah, Julie and
I made this plan.

03:49.730 --> 03:55.267
We do a five mile jog
before breakfast every day.

03:55.269 --> 03:59.371
-Well I'm glad you came out.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.273
I know it's hard to get away.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.175
-OK, ready?

04:03.177 --> 04:05.677
-Oh my god.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.845
This is so cool.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.146
-Oh, eh.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.514
-At least one of
us made it, right?

04:09.516 --> 04:11.116
-I haven't exactly
made it, but--

04:11.118 --> 04:13.051
-Ah, I think there's a
half a million YouTube

04:13.053 --> 04:14.653
viewers that would disagree.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.255
-People will come up to her in
the streets singing her songs.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.757
-Well how do you leave
all your adoring fans?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.959
-It was time.

04:21.962 --> 04:22.561
-See that?

04:25.431 --> 04:27.032
That's where I'm
taking you tonight.

04:30.336 --> 04:31.536
-What's over there?

04:35.041 --> 04:35.641
-You'll see.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.751
-He's still limping.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.063
You did all you could.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.000
-Yeah.

06:03.496 --> 06:05.330
I really missed you guys,

06:05.332 --> 06:06.498
-Yes, indeed.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.399
-Well said, brother.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.100
-Hear, hear.

06:10.603 --> 06:15.006
-Man, I haven't had
food-food in forever.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.775
-What do you mean food-food?

06:16.777 --> 06:21.179
-I mean, last year I
decided no more sauces.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.481
-Come on, you're from Kansas.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.849
You can't betray your roots.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.284
A man needs steak sauce.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.854
-I figure, why dump
liquid all over your food?

06:28.856 --> 06:29.955
-Hm.

06:29.957 --> 06:30.589
Taste?

06:30.591 --> 06:31.790
Taste.

06:31.792 --> 06:32.557
-Taste.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.859
Gonna go with that.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.395
-There's a taste, would
be another reason.

06:37.698 --> 06:41.099
Oh, in Cambodia they've
got this fish sauce

06:41.101 --> 06:42.234
that they put on everything.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.535
It's amazing.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.638
Very hot and it
makes your tongue

06:46.640 --> 06:48.874
feel like it's disintegrating.

06:48.876 --> 06:49.808
-Wow.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.110
Yeah.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.578
-God, you've been everywhere.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.579
-Mm-hmm.

06:54.581 --> 07:00.452
-The only traveling I do
is for work or a wedding.

07:02.688 --> 07:05.090
At least I'm building
up frequent flyer miles.

07:05.092 --> 07:05.924
-Mm!

07:05.926 --> 07:06.758
Me too.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.026
Yeah.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.194
-What's yours?

07:09.196 --> 07:12.030
-Um, a little thing
called Premier.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.298
-Mm, Premier Exec.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.733
I should have known that.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.769
-You gotta earn the
unlimited domestic upgrades.

07:17.771 --> 07:18.737
-I can see that.

07:18.739 --> 07:19.971
-I'm sorry.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.239
I'm sorry, this is great.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.408
The best is the story
of when I got it.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.877
I was this close, and
I realized it at work.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.480
And all of a sudden I
just got up from my desk

07:28.482 --> 07:31.149
and flew to Seattle
for lunch and back just

07:31.151 --> 07:31.950
to earn my status.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.759
- The fuck
am I sitting here with?

07:48.836 --> 07:49.801
Barry,
that was fucking great, man.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.103
You
liked when I softened up

07:52.105 --> 07:53.071
at the end of the verse?

07:53.073 --> 07:54.272
Yes!

07:54.274 --> 07:55.307
That was genius.

07:55.309 --> 07:55.907
All right.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.442
Hold on, hold on.

07:57.444 --> 07:58.777
I gotta write this down.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.212
No,
let's just do it again.

08:00.214 --> 08:01.413
Don't write the fucker down.

08:01.415 --> 08:02.113
Let's do it again, come on.

08:03.383 --> 08:04.549
Give me the ball.

08:04.551 --> 08:05.784
I've

08:05.786 --> 08:06.952
been in the grip of
love.

08:06.954 --> 08:10.388
Intimately acquainted
with T-Rex.

08:10.390 --> 08:15.060
So dive into a deed.

08:15.062 --> 08:18.597
I've been fed up.

08:18.599 --> 08:25.337
I mean, I've had enough
terrors in my sleep.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.539
You're the only one I need.

08:27.541 --> 08:30.709
BARRY AND ANNA (ON
Then

08:30.711 --> 08:39.885
that soft wind hits
me from the south.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.253
Oh, how I--

08:41.255 --> 08:43.722
So I was
going across camps.

08:43.724 --> 08:47.092
I see this guy with
his piercing blue eyes.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.226
He's got the frosted tips.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.227
OK.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.629
He's got a lot of gel in it.

08:50.631 --> 08:53.131
It's looking like a real,
you know, a douche bag.

08:53.133 --> 08:53.832
-Aw.

08:53.834 --> 08:57.168
-And I said to myself, Anna,
you must know this man.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.403
-He was the scholarship kid.

08:58.405 --> 09:01.072
He was dropping $50
on a hair stylist.

09:01.074 --> 09:01.806
That's a tool.

09:01.808 --> 09:05.777
Every girl wanted to be with you
and every guy wanted to be you.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.813
And we got high just
being around you.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.549
-Yeah, that's because
I gave you drugs.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.017
- That's true.

09:12.019 --> 09:15.320
Speaking of which, um, hello?

09:15.322 --> 09:16.688
No.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.256
-We met that day too.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.791
-You weren't there.

09:19.793 --> 09:23.428
-I guess my first impressions
don't set rivers on fire,

09:23.430 --> 09:25.830
but I'm a slow boil.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.132
Come on, I was sexy, right?

09:30.036 --> 09:31.269
Say yes.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.304
-Yes.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.940
-Tonight is all about you, dude.

09:34.942 --> 09:35.974
Happy birthday.

09:35.976 --> 09:36.775
It's you're night.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.610
Hehe.

09:38.612 --> 09:39.377
-Tomorrow Anna.

09:39.379 --> 09:40.211
-What about you?

09:40.213 --> 09:42.080
-No, I'm good.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.882
You guys coming out
here is plenty for me.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.017
-Oh, that is some regal shit.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.852
Cheers.

09:47.854 --> 09:50.689
-I'm here.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.357
-All right, check this out.

09:55.194 --> 09:57.529
-What is it?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.232
No way.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.969
- Oh, man.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.638
-Looks like you're about to tell
him a secret to the universe.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.273
-I'm still waiting for that one.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.574
-Yeah.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.309
That's later.

10:12.813 --> 10:18.583
So I'm 5, maybe 6, and I go
into the school bathroom.

10:18.585 --> 10:21.786
And I see a perfect
pile of clothing.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.655
There's Velcro
shoes at the bottom

10:23.657 --> 10:25.824
with these socks
tucked neatly inside.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.760
There were sweat pants folded
on top, military style.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.629
And on top of it all?

10:30.631 --> 10:32.831
A t-shirt.

10:32.833 --> 10:39.304
And then I realized, this kid
takes shits completely naked.

10:40.707 --> 10:41.940
So I got-- I figured I got
to get to know this kid.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.642
This kid-- this is
an interesting kid.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.877
A couple days later, I see
him out in the playground

10:45.879 --> 10:48.480
and he's being chased
by the asshole kid.

10:48.482 --> 10:49.347
What'd call himself?

10:49.349 --> 10:50.048
Skeletor?

10:50.050 --> 10:55.053
Harassing him with
this plastic crossbow.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.389
And I wait for the right
time, and they come around.

10:57.391 --> 10:58.023
I go whack!

10:58.025 --> 10:58.857
-Whoa.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.992
-Knock him on his ass.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.696
I stand over him, I point
to Barry, and I say,

11:04.698 --> 11:06.798
that's my best friend.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.967
OK?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.335
I didn't even know your name.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.637
Wait just one second.

11:12.639 --> 11:13.872
This is great.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.840
We go on this school
trip to DC, right?

11:15.842 --> 11:17.175
And everybody knows Bareman.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.044
He's like the horniest
guy in school, right?

11:19.046 --> 11:22.647
So he whacks it 4 times, 5 times
a day, something like that?

11:22.649 --> 11:23.915
And we're all staying together.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.483
And so, you know,
he's got to hold off.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.186
And he's just getting angrier
and angrier the whole trip.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.456
I was like, Barry, what are
you so-- why are you so upset?

11:31.458 --> 11:34.125
He's like, oh man,
I'm just so horny.

11:34.127 --> 11:37.462
When I get home, I could
whack it to anything.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.663
And I'm like, anything?

11:38.665 --> 11:40.298
You could whack to
anything, Bareman?

11:40.300 --> 11:41.132
Like anything?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.268
Yeah, I could whack it anything.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.103
I-- I could what it to
a-- and I don't even

11:45.105 --> 11:48.173
know where he got this-- I could
whack it to a golden fucking

11:48.175 --> 11:50.408
-Gold-- a golden cube.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.476
A golden cube.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.711
A what?

11:52.713 --> 11:54.179
-Can I please take
over the story here?

11:54.181 --> 11:57.215
A golden cube because it's
floating in space and it's

11:57.217 --> 11:59.317
It's devoid of any sexuality.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.485
It's a competitive challenge.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.486
Yeah.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.620
-He didn't make that clear.

12:02.622 --> 12:03.955
-Wow.

12:03.957 --> 12:07.959
-So I get home, I lay
on my bed, and I focus.

12:07.961 --> 12:11.262
And I'm picturing this gold
cube floating in space.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.234
-And then I think
of Stacy Carter.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.136
-Or some other hot chick.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.104
And I stop.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.539
I become fully flaccid.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.508
Start from scratch,
and I do it again.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.442
And I did it.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.210
-You did.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.045
-We don't know if you did it.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.179
Nobody knows if you did it.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.214
How do you prove that?

12:29.216 --> 12:30.582
How do you prove that--

12:30.584 --> 12:32.150
-I guess you just
have to trust my word.

12:32.152 --> 12:37.722
-Hey, here's to being
pathologically honest.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.358
-Pathologically honest Barry.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.160
-Shh, you be quiet.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.394
Shut up.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.697
Get in my mouth.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.602
-Uh, happy birthday
to us, right?

12:50.604 --> 12:51.302
-To you.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.137
Me.

12:52.139 --> 12:55.173
- Ha-- happy birthday.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.546
That's my terrible
birthday song.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.580
-Yeah, you killed it.

13:02.582 --> 13:03.681
Look, I need more booze.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.350
-This is giving me anxiety.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.384
-Shh, make a wish.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.324
Nice.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.692
-It's almost time.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.263
For what?

14:07.713 --> 14:09.080
-I forget how many there are.

14:14.887 --> 14:19.090
-Come on, brown eyes.

14:19.092 --> 14:19.490
-OK.

14:58.264 --> 15:02.267
-This cave, it's
not just a cave.

15:11.277 --> 15:11.676
Shh.

15:17.349 --> 15:20.919
People have been coming
here for centuries.

15:20.921 --> 15:24.589
I saw a pack of coyotes
standing where you are.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.523
Staring in.

15:28.961 --> 15:35.099
You go into the cave, your
deepest desire comes true.

15:39.171 --> 15:41.739
-Does that mean there's
like a genie that's

15:41.741 --> 15:43.775
in a bottle in there?

15:43.777 --> 15:45.610
-No, no.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.111
None of that genie shit.

15:47.113 --> 15:50.715
See, genies, they give
you what you want.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.318
This cave knows what you need.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.988
-I think I'd rather have
the genie in the bottle.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.357
-I think you'd just like
anything that's in a bottle.

15:59.359 --> 15:59.958
-Shut up.

16:02.561 --> 16:03.761
-You.

16:03.763 --> 16:04.662
Go in.

16:04.664 --> 16:05.863
-Oh, come on, Travis.

16:05.865 --> 16:06.564
Please.

16:06.566 --> 16:07.265
Come on.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.334
We see it.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.536
-Go in.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.272
You scared?

16:14.274 --> 16:14.672
-Yes.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.144
Going in.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.447
-No.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.115
OK, all right.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.727
-It's so narrow.

16:39.631 --> 16:41.265
Have you been in there?

16:50.943 --> 16:52.610
What's
that dripping sound?

16:57.449 --> 16:58.049
OK.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.529
-Are you OK?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.531
-Uh-huh.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.132
Yeah.

17:19.505 --> 17:21.305
Yeah.

17:21.307 --> 17:24.375
Bet that's good for the
property value, huh?

17:24.377 --> 17:27.645
Magical cave.

17:27.646 --> 17:28.679
You should go in, Barry.

17:28.681 --> 17:29.280
It's fun.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.014
-OK.

18:03.016 --> 18:07.552
That's uh, pretty cool.

18:07.554 --> 18:08.553
-Yeah?

18:08.555 --> 18:11.522
Cool.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.558
-Should we, uh?

18:13.560 --> 18:14.525
You're not going in?

18:14.527 --> 18:16.260
-No, no.

18:16.262 --> 18:16.661
-Travis.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.895
-You're doing better
than I thought.

19:23.897 --> 19:26.931
He took us to this magical cave.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.000
No, we didn't do drugs.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.002
I promise.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.070
It was my monster.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.907
Mm.

19:35.909 --> 19:38.109
Good night.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.577
-Got everything you need?

19:43.916 --> 19:46.918
-Um, heh.

19:46.920 --> 19:47.518
Yeah.

19:50.489 --> 19:50.888
Um.

19:55.127 --> 19:58.496
-I love you, Bareman.

19:58.498 --> 19:58.896
-Hm?

20:03.101 --> 20:04.202
-I love you, Bareman.

20:09.641 --> 20:10.241
-Uh.

20:12.811 --> 20:13.578
Good night, dude.

20:22.988 --> 20:26.457
-I said I love you.

20:26.459 --> 20:30.595
I love you, Bareman.

20:33.365 --> 20:41.239
I love you, Bareman.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.741
-I love you too, man.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.442
-All right.

20:47.145 --> 20:47.845
All right.

22:15.801 --> 22:16.400
-Anna?

22:20.505 --> 22:22.139
-Hey.

22:22.141 --> 22:22.773
-You OK?

22:22.775 --> 22:24.542
Sorry, it was just a bad dream.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.277
You just got startled.

22:26.279 --> 22:27.178
-What's going on?

22:27.180 --> 22:28.179
-Just a bad dream.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.013
Just, screaming.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.015
-What kind of dream?

22:31.017 --> 22:32.583
-It's nothing.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.984
-Yeah?

22:33.986 --> 22:35.353
-Yeah.

22:35.355 --> 22:36.554
Good night.

22:46.264 --> 22:46.864
-Oh.

22:49.835 --> 22:51.102
-Hey!

22:51.104 --> 22:51.736
No!

22:51.738 --> 22:55.072
-I'm just checking out the
latest from the new world.

22:55.074 --> 22:55.673
-Travis.

22:55.675 --> 22:56.741
-Oh.

22:56.743 --> 23:01.245
Ah, you even sleep
with this thing?

23:01.247 --> 23:04.081
-It's not funny.

23:04.083 --> 23:04.982
-You must be hooked.

23:08.353 --> 23:11.322
Don't stay up too late.

23:11.324 --> 23:11.922
-Shit.

24:33.738 --> 24:36.106
-Look, I'm figuring it out.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.379
Yes.

24:42.381 --> 24:43.113
Soon, OK?

24:50.088 --> 24:50.688
OK.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.024
I love you too.

25:28.326 --> 25:30.461
-Be nice to me now.

25:30.463 --> 25:31.896
I'm a cripple.

25:31.898 --> 25:32.830
-Got it?

25:32.832 --> 25:33.797
Got it!

25:33.799 --> 25:35.132
Yeah!

25:35.134 --> 25:36.467
Still got it!

25:36.469 --> 25:37.334
-See that?

25:37.336 --> 25:38.936
-Yeah?

25:38.938 --> 25:41.839
-You uh, you just check out his
patented I mean business mode.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.008
He pushes his glasses back
up the bridge of his nose

25:44.010 --> 25:46.110
when he's about to kick
it into another gear.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.111
Ready, Bareman?

25:47.113 --> 25:48.479
-Ready!

25:48.481 --> 25:51.115
-Yeah.

25:53.052 --> 25:56.654
Another
friend decided to come.

25:56.656 --> 25:59.390
She's got the bedroom.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.692
Anna.

26:01.694 --> 26:04.161
It's a surprise for me too.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.462
OK.

26:05.464 --> 26:06.797
Yes, I took my jog.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.267
It was gorgeous.

26:17.175 --> 26:18.142
Come on.

26:33.325 --> 26:36.260
-You know, I pictured
you out here.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.429
-Oh, yeah?

26:38.431 --> 26:39.797
Is that what you imagined?

26:44.669 --> 26:46.804
-You know, we need a guitarist.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.572
-You're playing with
some good musicians.

26:48.574 --> 26:50.574
-Ah, yes.

26:50.576 --> 26:51.675
They're good.

26:59.184 --> 27:00.351
We need a wild man.

27:07.192 --> 27:08.759
It'd be like old times.

27:12.497 --> 27:14.665
Except now you're a silver fox.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.208
-Can you believe
Bareman's jogging?

28:03.782 --> 28:04.748
Ooh.

28:15.061 --> 28:15.759
- Yeah.

28:29.340 --> 28:30.140
- Ooh.

28:50.895 --> 28:56.400
You've got the numbers
all colored in your head.

28:56.402 --> 29:00.571
You can't resist because my
love's got a half a life.

29:00.573 --> 29:05.542
One by one is
seven, seven times.

29:05.544 --> 29:09.680
And the dealer
whispers into your ear,

29:09.682 --> 29:12.449
you better bet it all.

29:12.451 --> 29:13.217
Ooh.

29:34.305 --> 29:39.910
You do the long
division in your head.

29:39.912 --> 29:43.747
You can't resist because my
love's got a half a life.

29:43.749 --> 29:48.652
And you have carried the
ones who remained too long.

29:48.654 --> 29:56.360
And the sphere whispers in your
ear, you better bet it all,

29:56.362 --> 30:00.464
you better bet it all.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.231
Ooh.

30:31.362 --> 30:33.897
Shit, what's the bridge?

30:33.899 --> 30:37.167
-We never found it.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.035
-Really?

30:38.037 --> 30:38.702
-Yeah.

30:38.704 --> 30:39.503
-Shit.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.262
I know.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.130
I know we said no gifts, but
I really couldn't help myself.

31:07.132 --> 31:10.500
- Ah, yes!

31:10.502 --> 31:11.235
Cool.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.737
-Nice, thank you.

31:13.739 --> 31:16.073
-Try it on.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.976
I think I got the right size.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.844
-Dude, you look great.

31:20.846 --> 31:21.979
-It's jogging, dude.

31:21.981 --> 31:23.347
Yeah, you look good.

31:25.817 --> 31:26.650
-Feels good.

31:26.652 --> 31:27.351
-It fits.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.819
I love it.

31:28.821 --> 31:30.087
Open yours.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.488
-Yeah.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.089
Yeah.

31:43.201 --> 31:45.802
-I couldn't stand the idea
of you having all these songs

31:45.804 --> 31:47.104
stuck in your head.

31:47.106 --> 31:55.379
So-- wanted you to be
able to record them.

31:55.381 --> 31:56.146
-Thanks.

31:56.148 --> 31:56.546
-Mm-hmm.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.187
-When I was out
there on the road,

32:04.189 --> 32:06.189
everything felt like a dream.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.791
It's just felt so unreal.

32:07.793 --> 32:12.496
And then when I got back, it was
like everything was too real.

32:12.498 --> 32:16.300
I feel-- I feel like I
have to choose a path.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.168
And even if I don't
choose a path, you know,

32:18.170 --> 32:20.003
that's-- that's like
choosing a path.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.705
So no matter what--

32:21.707 --> 32:22.873
Exactly.

32:22.875 --> 32:24.408
It's kind of
startling how similar

32:24.410 --> 32:26.643
it is to what I've been thinking
about the last few years.

32:26.645 --> 32:29.346
-Yeah.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.681
Yeah.

32:30.683 --> 32:31.615
-You were saying?

32:31.617 --> 32:33.083
-Oh.

32:33.085 --> 32:34.985
I'm-- I'm just saying that
I feel the-- the pressure

32:34.987 --> 32:36.653
of choosing a path, you know?

32:36.655 --> 32:38.288
But I want it to
be the right one.

32:41.893 --> 32:44.027
I know we're all, you
know, we're super busy.

32:44.029 --> 32:53.303
And we really screwed each
other over a lot, but-- fuck,

32:53.305 --> 32:55.639
I miss you guys.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.373
-Yeah.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.641
-Yeah, yeah.

32:57.643 --> 32:58.542
-Yeah.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.177
-Yeah.

33:00.179 --> 33:03.013
-I want to know what
Barry's thinking.

33:03.015 --> 33:06.116
What are you thinking, Barry?

33:06.118 --> 33:08.018
-Uh, I don't know.

33:08.020 --> 33:13.690
Uh, we've got to stay
friends for sure.

33:13.692 --> 33:14.691
-Nah, I mean in general.

33:16.061 --> 33:18.128
What are you hoping for?

33:18.130 --> 33:20.630
-Uh, I don't know.

33:20.632 --> 33:21.598
I feel lucky.

33:24.669 --> 33:25.602
-Really, that's all?

33:25.604 --> 33:28.205
It's not-- nothing else?

33:28.207 --> 33:31.241
-Well, I mean, I guess there's
things that I will want.

33:31.243 --> 33:35.412
But right now,
basically, I've got it.

33:38.149 --> 33:42.753
And honestly what's
cool is this stability.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.557
-Ah.

33:47.559 --> 33:51.528
-And the best part about it
is this sense of independence.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.197
-Being a tax attorney gives
you a sense of independence?

33:59.937 --> 34:01.505
-OK, sure.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.473
I have partners looking over
my shoulder and I'm super busy.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.409
But I get my work done,
I put in my hours,

34:05.411 --> 34:10.981
and everything's--
everything's under control.

34:10.983 --> 34:15.619
It's, um-- to me
that's independence.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.654
Look, there are a lot
of paths out there,

34:17.656 --> 34:19.022
and that can be paralyzing.

34:19.024 --> 34:22.793
And I'm just happy I
found the right one.

34:26.431 --> 34:29.766
-You are impressive,
you know that?

34:29.768 --> 34:31.768
I get needing to make a living.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.370
I do, I get it.

34:33.371 --> 34:35.272
It's just the way you
embrace the whole thing

34:35.274 --> 34:37.139
as the one and only path.

34:37.141 --> 34:38.175
-I didn't say that.

34:38.177 --> 34:40.010
-Yeah, you kind of said that.

34:40.012 --> 34:41.710
-Nah, it's really--
it's impressive.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.313
It really is.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.514
-OK.

34:44.516 --> 34:47.217
-Here's how I see it.

34:47.219 --> 34:49.018
You got a bag of
marbles in front of you

34:49.021 --> 34:52.054
and you reach into the bag.

34:52.056 --> 34:56.793
And you're thinking, man,
I'd like a blue marble.

34:56.795 --> 35:00.230
A blue marble would be great.

35:00.232 --> 35:03.066
I really want blue.

35:03.068 --> 35:04.868
You reach in that bag
and you pull it out.

35:04.870 --> 35:08.004
Bam, red.

35:08.006 --> 35:12.275
And you're like,
well that's red.

35:12.277 --> 35:16.480
That's not blue, I
really wanted blue.

35:16.482 --> 35:17.481
But you know what?

35:17.483 --> 35:19.249
Red's OK.

35:19.251 --> 35:22.085
Yeah, no, red's
good, red's good.

35:22.087 --> 35:24.654
Red's just fine.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.456
I reach into that bag.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.425
I'm looking for the
shiny marble, man.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.527
I'm looking for the
shiniest marble in there.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.963
If I miss it, I
reach for it again,

35:32.965 --> 35:34.397
and I reach for it
again, because I'm

35:34.399 --> 35:36.466
going to get that fucker.

35:36.468 --> 35:39.269
Maybe you just passed up a
bunch of perfectly good models

35:39.271 --> 35:42.439
because it's not exactly
what you pictured.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.040
-OK.

35:44.042 --> 35:46.643
Now we're talking, all right.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.677
-Whatever.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.179
I didn't mean that.

35:49.181 --> 35:50.981
-No, I think it's the first
thing you met all weekend.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.282
Hey, maybe you're right.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.783
Maybe if we went with
the jackass manager,

35:53.785 --> 35:55.018
it would have been our ticket.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.486
-That jackass manager?

35:56.488 --> 35:59.289
He's worked with
some serious bands.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.258
Have you-- have
you seen what he's

36:01.260 --> 36:02.592
done for Marvin Taylor's band?

36:02.594 --> 36:03.493
Or the Resistance?

36:03.495 --> 36:06.096
You mean the Connecticut
suburbanites who, uh,

36:06.098 --> 36:07.664
think they're Che Guevara.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.600
Well, they're still together.

36:10.602 --> 36:11.801
-They do suck.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.069
-They do suck.

36:13.071 --> 36:14.571
They suck.

36:14.573 --> 36:17.040
They sit there signing about
le revolution with a wink,

36:17.042 --> 36:19.342
and a smile, and their
cocks in their hand.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.011
-Well, they put out
another album, so.

36:21.013 --> 36:21.978
-Good for those clowns.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.280
I'm happy for them.

36:23.282 --> 36:24.614
It makes me feel like
anything's possible.

36:24.616 --> 36:26.249
-I'm just saying
they make a living.

36:26.251 --> 36:28.318
-And I'm just saying I
don't want to hear about it.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.890
-No-- do you--

36:33.892 --> 36:34.524
-Can--

36:34.526 --> 36:35.659
Don't.

36:35.661 --> 36:39.629
Do you know how hard Anna
worked to get us hooked up?

36:39.631 --> 36:41.131
Do you have any idea?

36:41.133 --> 36:42.599
-Yeah, she pounded the pavement.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.068
-No, no you don't get it, OK?

36:45.070 --> 36:47.938
She worked her ass off
because we had a chance.

36:47.940 --> 36:48.672
-A chance?

36:48.674 --> 36:49.806
-Yes.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.074
- --what?

36:51.076 --> 36:52.342
The guy would have
watered down our sound

36:52.344 --> 36:53.910
before we even knew
what our sound was.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.679
-You-- you don't have a sound
if you can't pay your rent.

36:55.681 --> 36:58.682
-You compromise one thing, you
compromise everything, man.

36:58.684 --> 36:59.649
The great bands?

36:59.651 --> 37:02.652
The really great bands?

37:02.654 --> 37:04.187
They struggle.

37:04.189 --> 37:06.056
But I don't think you
have that in your DNA.

37:06.058 --> 37:07.757
-What is with your
mixed metaphors

37:07.759 --> 37:10.594
and your-- your-- your
evolutionary bullshit?

37:10.596 --> 37:13.730
What-- what's so bad about
being a decent working band?

37:13.732 --> 37:16.333
-I didn't go through all like
shit to make something decent.

37:16.335 --> 37:17.867
-Look, none of us
we're ever going

37:17.869 --> 37:20.704
to be John effing Lennon, OK?

37:20.706 --> 37:22.572
And maybe you're still
holding on to that.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.274
And-- and while
there's something

37:24.276 --> 37:26.142
to-- to be said about dreams
and-- and what we're told

37:26.144 --> 37:28.378
is children that we can
do and achieve anything.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.447
It's also kind of
a huge goddamn lie.

37:40.891 --> 37:42.659
-So what?

37:42.661 --> 37:44.194
You've moved on?

37:44.196 --> 37:45.195
-Yeah.

37:45.197 --> 37:46.329
Yeah.

37:46.331 --> 37:49.099
I mean, we gave it
a few years, OK?

37:49.101 --> 37:50.567
I had to find a real profession.

37:50.569 --> 37:51.067
-Music's a--

37:51.069 --> 37:51.935
-Thats--

37:51.937 --> 37:52.569
- --real profession.

37:52.571 --> 37:55.038
-Look man, if you
would have just told us

37:55.040 --> 37:55.505
that you were applying
to law school.

37:58.709 --> 38:00.310
-You would have
talked me out of it.

38:00.312 --> 38:01.711
-Oh, I'm that convincing?

38:01.713 --> 38:03.580
Maybe I should have
been the fucking lawyer.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.849
-It was shitty when you left.

38:05.851 --> 38:06.816
It was.

38:06.818 --> 38:07.784
-Excuse me?

38:07.786 --> 38:10.520
Excuse me for once that
I made a decision that

38:10.522 --> 38:11.921
was for the benefit of myself.

38:14.292 --> 38:14.891
Barry.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.563
-Soaking up the good times.

38:20.565 --> 38:21.731
Thanks for having us, Travis.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.900
-You need to do
something good, man.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.035
Something real.

38:25.037 --> 38:26.069
-Me?

38:26.071 --> 38:27.437
Me do something real?

38:27.439 --> 38:29.339
That's actually very
funny coming from you.

38:29.341 --> 38:31.007
I'm a productive
member of society.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.609
What do you do?

38:32.611 --> 38:34.577
I'm not some loner losing his
mind out in the fucking desert.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.049
-I need to tell you something.

38:43.187 --> 38:43.953
Come with me.

38:54.098 --> 38:58.601
My uncle liked to
look up at the sky,

38:58.603 --> 39:00.537
even then he couldn't
take much sun.

39:10.881 --> 39:12.048
He wasn't an easy man.

39:15.986 --> 39:17.554
We understood each other.

39:22.793 --> 39:24.761
When I left New York I--

39:26.131 --> 39:29.366
I knew I was coming here.

39:29.368 --> 39:35.805
And when I arrived,
he'd been expecting me.

39:35.807 --> 39:39.275
He loved listening
to me play and I

39:39.277 --> 39:41.878
loved watching him listen.

39:41.880 --> 39:48.051
One afternoon I was playing
and looked over at him.

39:52.156 --> 39:58.428
And uh, he was just staring up.

40:02.032 --> 40:02.632
Quiet.

40:07.838 --> 40:09.973
Never seen quiet
like that before.

40:16.280 --> 40:25.422
I went outside and I burned all
my song books and my lyrics.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.390
All that.

40:27.392 --> 40:29.159
I finally had a purpose.

40:37.968 --> 40:38.902
So maybe you're right.

40:43.174 --> 40:43.907
What I've done.

40:47.244 --> 40:50.313
I can't pay my mortgage with it.

40:50.315 --> 40:52.982
It won't get me on
any magazine covers.

40:57.788 --> 41:08.164
But helping a man die,
what is that worth?

41:08.166 --> 41:11.968
Is it like a thousand?

41:11.970 --> 41:12.936
A hundred thousand?

41:18.175 --> 41:21.478
It's like our jam outside.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.012
You can't put a
dollar sign on it.

41:27.284 --> 41:31.321
This place has so much spirit.

41:31.323 --> 41:32.188
It has his blessing.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.794
We start our album here.

41:37.796 --> 41:40.730
Our songs are going to
break people wide open, man.

41:40.732 --> 41:41.698
-Listen.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.633
-I know it's what you want.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.535
You brought the recorder.

41:45.537 --> 41:48.137
-Yeah, I mean--
well-- I've definitely

41:48.139 --> 41:50.306
written some new songs
while I've been here.

41:50.308 --> 41:51.207
-Yeah.

41:51.209 --> 41:52.375
Yeah, that'd be cool.

41:52.377 --> 41:53.810
-I'd be down to try it out.

41:53.812 --> 41:58.314
-I was-- I was thinking
we'd do something together.

41:58.316 --> 42:00.683
-Or we could start
with what we have.

42:00.685 --> 42:03.253
-Nah, I was thinking we should
start with something new,

42:03.255 --> 42:05.088
right?

42:05.090 --> 42:05.755
New, right?

42:08.425 --> 42:11.094
What?

42:11.096 --> 42:14.030
-It's always on your terms.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.165
Forget it.

42:16.167 --> 42:19.035
-What?

42:19.037 --> 42:19.969
Whoa, what?

42:19.971 --> 42:22.305
All of us, together.

42:22.307 --> 42:23.940
-This is too much for me.

42:23.942 --> 42:25.642
-Too much?

42:25.644 --> 42:27.343
Too much is a good thing.

42:27.345 --> 42:28.678
I live for too much.

42:31.382 --> 42:32.649
All of us, we're here right now.

42:32.651 --> 42:33.483
The band's together.

42:33.485 --> 42:34.384
This is the band.

42:34.386 --> 42:36.519
-No, there's no band.

42:36.521 --> 42:39.489
There's no band, man.

42:39.491 --> 42:41.190
It's not going to
be a band again.

42:44.495 --> 42:47.797
Look, I have a home, I
have a career, a wife.

42:52.436 --> 42:55.305
This is a fantasy.

42:55.307 --> 42:56.205
This is a fantasy.

43:07.318 --> 43:07.917
-Travis.

43:10.321 --> 43:10.920
Travis.

43:17.295 --> 43:20.229
Fuck.

43:20.231 --> 43:21.197
You know what?

43:21.199 --> 43:24.100
This is my fault.

43:24.102 --> 43:26.436
I said some dumb shit to him.

43:26.438 --> 43:28.271
I-- by saying I got
him the recorder,

43:28.273 --> 43:32.275
and this morning I asked him
to play guitar in my band.

43:33.445 --> 43:35.378
-Bet that would
work out real well.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.246
-It would be good for him.

43:37.248 --> 43:38.147
-For him, exactly.

43:38.149 --> 43:39.849
-You know what, Barry?

43:39.851 --> 43:43.953
I was in the hospital
when he was recovering.

43:43.955 --> 43:47.590
You stopped returning
his phone calls.

43:47.592 --> 43:48.491
-You left too.

43:48.493 --> 43:49.192
You left the country.

43:53.263 --> 43:56.099
-He wouldn't talk to me.

43:56.101 --> 44:00.737
-And I need to start my life.

44:00.739 --> 44:02.205
You know something?

44:02.207 --> 44:03.940
You never even given me a
fraction of this concern.

44:03.942 --> 44:06.242
-Don't.

44:06.244 --> 44:07.010
-What?

44:07.012 --> 44:08.711
-Don't what?

44:08.713 --> 44:11.648
- Barry, you're happy.

44:11.650 --> 44:13.583
You're well adjusted now.

44:13.585 --> 44:14.851
-And what's wrong with that?

44:14.853 --> 44:17.353
Do you know what your
problem is, Anna?

44:17.355 --> 44:18.921
You don't want
what's good for you.

44:21.291 --> 44:23.626
And if you were single for
longer than a nanosecond,

44:23.628 --> 44:25.328
you'd have a little
bit of perspective.

44:54.858 --> 44:57.126
-You don't really think, do you?

45:03.434 --> 45:04.701
-What about hedge fund guy?

45:04.703 --> 45:05.868
-Oh, Barry.

45:05.870 --> 45:09.238
That guy was a rebound.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.908
-How am I supposed to feel
about some rich dude tossing you

45:11.910 --> 45:13.710
around before you
have Olympic sex?

45:13.712 --> 45:14.610
-Who said that?

45:14.612 --> 45:16.979
-You did.

45:16.981 --> 45:18.514
-Fuck.

45:18.516 --> 45:21.250
-For your information, I've
become a pretty good lover.

45:24.154 --> 45:25.121
-Nobody's doubting you.

45:32.329 --> 45:33.329
Sing Driftwood for me.

45:36.633 --> 45:37.233
Please.

45:41.171 --> 45:42.271
Sing my song for me.

45:54.218 --> 45:55.218
My only.

45:57.621 --> 45:59.388
Know him a little now.

46:05.896 --> 46:17.507
But it only takes a little
for him to break down.

46:22.446 --> 46:30.520
And she's really
wanting him more.

46:34.525 --> 46:43.299
Now she can't remember what
all these drugs are for.

46:50.908 --> 46:54.410
She only wants sanity.

47:02.753 --> 47:04.854
-I think that
song's about Travis.

47:27.711 --> 47:28.311
-Travis?

48:10.153 --> 48:10.553
Barry.

48:14.958 --> 48:17.526
Are you good?

48:18.930 --> 48:20.129
Screw good.

48:22.532 --> 48:23.666
Good doesn't work for you.

48:28.839 --> 48:30.673
Only an asshole can
hold your attention

48:30.675 --> 48:31.641
longer than two weeks.

48:34.412 --> 48:37.747
It was a mistake.

48:37.749 --> 48:40.082
-And then you thought,
you know what?

48:40.084 --> 48:42.585
Maybe I'll start
screwing Travis again.

48:47.591 --> 48:56.365
You and him in a bathroom stall
while I was waiting for you

48:56.367 --> 48:57.733
at Stella's.

48:57.735 --> 48:59.135
-Barry, come on.

48:59.137 --> 49:02.004
-Even then, I thought,
you know what?

49:02.006 --> 49:06.042
Maybe she's just
working something out.

49:06.044 --> 49:07.843
Maybe she just needs the time.

49:07.845 --> 49:09.779
-Hey.

49:09.781 --> 49:11.213
Hey, you were like my brother.

49:14.551 --> 49:15.885
-I know.

49:15.887 --> 49:18.387
You just want me to grab
you like this, right?

49:18.389 --> 49:19.388
Is this what you wanted?

49:19.390 --> 49:21.590
-I should have
grabbed you like this.

49:21.592 --> 49:22.792
Stop fucking laughing at me!

49:23.661 --> 49:25.227
-Stop!

49:25.229 --> 49:27.997
Because this is what
you respond to, right?

49:27.999 --> 49:30.967
This is what you want?

49:30.969 --> 49:33.536
You know what I'm going to do.

49:33.538 --> 49:36.305
I know what I'm gonna do.

49:36.307 --> 49:38.674
I'm gonna fuck you
like a psychopath.

49:38.676 --> 49:41.077
I'm gonna fuck you so
that you forget his name.

49:41.079 --> 49:42.411
I'm gonna fuck you so that--

49:42.413 --> 49:44.347
- --you make song about me.

49:44.349 --> 49:45.381
I'm gonna fuck you
so you remember.

49:56.626 --> 49:58.194
- Barry, don't.

49:58.196 --> 49:58.594
Barry.

50:02.165 --> 50:04.900
Barry!

50:04.902 --> 50:05.501
-Ah.

50:08.905 --> 50:10.072
-You're fucking drunk!

50:13.143 --> 50:15.711
You go into the cave,

50:15.713 --> 50:17.313
your deepest desire comes true.

50:20.284 --> 50:20.683
-Ah!

50:40.972 --> 50:42.438
Hey, Barry.

50:42.440 --> 50:44.507
Are you OK?

50:44.509 --> 50:45.908
Hello?

50:45.910 --> 50:46.509
-Yeah.

50:49.212 --> 50:53.082
Listen, you're
drunk and confused.

50:53.084 --> 50:54.450
I get that, OK?

50:58.522 --> 50:59.121
OK?

51:04.728 --> 51:05.728
Night, Barry.

52:43.460 --> 52:44.326
-I'm sorry.

52:44.328 --> 52:45.828
It's just a bad dream.

52:45.830 --> 52:46.428
I'm sorry.

52:50.200 --> 52:51.567
Wait, wait, wait.

52:51.569 --> 52:52.768
Wait.

52:52.770 --> 52:53.602
Don't go.

52:58.742 --> 52:59.742
No, don't come in.

52:59.744 --> 53:00.442
Don't come in.

53:00.444 --> 53:02.811
Just stay.

53:02.813 --> 53:03.913
S-- stay.

53:15.592 --> 53:16.358
-What's the dream?

53:21.264 --> 53:23.399
Am I doing something
awful in it?

53:26.269 --> 53:27.336
Or is it about him?

53:30.040 --> 53:32.775
-It's-- it's about me.

53:37.714 --> 53:39.715
Do you think that
Travis went to the cave?

53:42.686 --> 53:43.686
Do you think it works?

54:10.280 --> 54:12.848
Everything's
going to be OK.

54:20.190 --> 54:24.093
-I'll make you eggs
in the morning.

54:24.095 --> 54:25.394
Just the way you like them.

54:29.099 --> 54:31.600
Then we'll go home.

54:31.602 --> 54:32.001
-Yeah.

54:36.573 --> 54:37.306
-Get some sleep.

55:11.341 --> 55:12.541
What are you doing?

56:15.705 --> 56:17.706
-Oh no.

56:17.708 --> 56:18.674
Come here.

56:18.676 --> 56:20.075
Come here.

56:20.077 --> 56:21.076
Right here.

56:32.455 --> 56:35.057
Just-- just--

56:43.433 --> 56:44.633
-I'd ruin you.

57:19.335 --> 57:20.636
RADIO INTERVIEWER

57:20.638 --> 57:22.738
On WMPM Bard College radio.

57:22.740 --> 57:24.706
Guys, why don't you
introduce yourselves to us?

57:24.708 --> 57:25.908
My name's Travis.

57:25.910 --> 57:27.576
I'm Barry.

57:27.578 --> 57:28.310
I play the drums.

57:28.312 --> 57:29.645
And, uh--

57:29.647 --> 57:31.079
My
name's Anna, and I sing.

57:31.081 --> 57:33.182
RADIO INTERVIEWER (ON
So tell me,

57:33.184 --> 57:34.383
how did the band meet?

57:34.385 --> 57:35.684
I closed my eyes

57:35.686 --> 57:37.352
and I imagined
this ray of light.

57:37.354 --> 57:38.687
Shut up.

57:38.689 --> 57:39.822
Well, believe or not,

57:39.824 --> 57:41.356
we were all born
in the same week.

57:41.358 --> 57:43.258
So Travis and I
were really drunk,

57:43.260 --> 57:44.860
celebrating our birthday.

57:44.862 --> 57:47.196
And we--
we run into Anna, really drunk,

57:47.198 --> 57:48.430
celebrating her birthday.

57:48.432 --> 57:49.865
So wasted.

57:49.867 --> 57:52.301
I think you--

57:53.871 --> 57:57.206
Just
improvising song and just--

57:57.208 --> 57:58.373
Yes.

57:58.375 --> 57:59.808
You killed it.

57:59.810 --> 58:00.409
Amazing.

58:00.411 --> 58:01.543
So good.

58:01.545 --> 58:02.945
RADIO INTERVIEWER

58:02.947 --> 58:04.513
So um, where do you see
yourselves down the road?

58:04.515 --> 58:05.714
Where do you see yourselves
10 years from now?

58:05.716 --> 58:06.982
Uh, I-- I really

58:06.984 --> 58:08.417
think if we keep doing
what we're doing,

58:08.419 --> 58:09.718
working hard, making
the right choices,

58:09.720 --> 58:11.753
and we'll be doing huge
things in 10 years.

58:11.755 --> 58:14.623
I
feel like we're on a path.

58:14.625 --> 58:16.792
If it has some twists
and turns or whatever,

58:16.794 --> 58:18.227
we're gonna make it happen.

58:18.229 --> 58:19.495
Wait,
I got your crystal ball

58:19.497 --> 58:20.696
right here.

58:20.698 --> 58:22.731
It says the road
we're on, in 10 years,

58:22.733 --> 58:25.534
we'll either be famous or dead.

59:06.109 --> 59:07.809
-Hey.

59:07.811 --> 59:10.279
Have you, uh-- have you
seen my keys anywhere?

59:10.281 --> 59:11.547
I can't seem to find them.

59:14.517 --> 59:17.486
-Can't find my cellphone.

59:17.488 --> 59:18.086
-Yeah.

59:20.990 --> 59:22.558
Some night, huh?

59:29.198 --> 59:31.733
-They've gotta be somewhere.

59:31.735 --> 59:32.134
-Yo.

59:38.007 --> 59:39.007
Yo, yo, yo.

59:42.111 --> 59:45.781
-Did you enjoy your
night in the desert?

59:45.783 --> 59:47.649
-Yeah.

59:47.651 --> 59:49.284
It was real nice.

59:52.255 --> 59:54.523
How about your night?

59:54.525 --> 59:56.091
Barry?

59:56.093 --> 59:57.359
-Yeah.

59:57.361 --> 59:58.627
It was fine.

59:58.629 --> 01:00:01.930
-You got nicked up
good there, partner.

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:03.899
How'd it happen?

01:00:03.901 --> 01:00:06.802
-An encounter with
the uh, counter.

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:09.037
-What else you
guys do last night?

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:11.573
-We hung out, OK?

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:12.941
-Something wrong, brother?

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.876
-I guess the night
didn't go as planned.

01:00:14.878 --> 01:00:18.480
Things not going according
to plan for Barry.

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:20.549
Wow, tell me more.

01:00:20.551 --> 01:00:22.284
-I thought we came
here to hang out.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:23.952
-Hm.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:25.587
I thought we were
being truthful.

01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:27.522
Is this what you wanted?

01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:30.292
I should
have grabbed you like this.

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:31.360
Stop fucking laughing at me!

01:00:31.362 --> 01:00:32.894
Stop!

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:35.864
I
know what I'm going to do.

01:00:35.866 --> 01:00:37.566
Fuck you like a psychopath.

01:00:37.568 --> 01:00:39.101
-Travis.

01:00:39.103 --> 01:00:41.370
Travis, give me that.

01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:42.571
Give it to me!

01:00:42.573 --> 01:00:43.405
-Enough.

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:44.740
-I'd cooled down.

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:46.575
Thought I'd see if you
two were getting along.

01:00:46.577 --> 01:00:47.776
-Oh, you asshole.

01:00:47.778 --> 01:00:48.910
-You should have
told me if you wanted

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:50.345
to write the first
song together.

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:51.079
-Just stop.

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:51.813
Please, stop.

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:54.416
Which one of you is doing that?

01:00:54.418 --> 01:00:55.317
-Would you please stop?

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:56.151
-That psychopath line?

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.954
I'm gonna have to use that.

01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:00.789
You're fucking drunk!

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:01.790
-You're staying here tonight.

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:02.991
We're making that album.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.693
-Jesus Christ.

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:05.661
-Where you going?

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:09.131
-Travis.

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:15.303
Travis.

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:16.638
Listen, man.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.839
Look, we're all exhausted.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.041
Let's not be idiots.

01:01:19.043 --> 01:01:20.442
Just give me the
rest of my shit back.

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:22.244
-Stay.

01:01:22.246 --> 01:01:23.078
-I've got a flight.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.213
-I can't just change my flight.

01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:26.448
-Use your miles.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.116
-Oh, come on, man.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.020
-I've got work tomorrow.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:34.022
-Julie's expecting me.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:35.524
She's expecting me to call now.

01:01:35.526 --> 01:01:37.092
We talk every morning.

01:01:37.094 --> 01:01:39.094
-Well, you're going to have
to give her the latest update.

01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:40.328
Or I can.

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.563
-Stop!

01:01:41.565 --> 01:01:42.764
-Is this your new
method of seduction?

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:47.536
Come on, take a
shot, but be careful.

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:49.037
You know who wins
a fight, don't you?

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:52.007
Not the strongest
or the tallest.

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:53.809
The craziest.

01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:55.310
I got ya beat there.

01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:56.945
Although, uh, I think you're
catching up pretty quick.

01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:58.346
Should I punch him
in the other eye

01:01:58.348 --> 01:02:01.550
or do you think it's just
going to turn him on?

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:02.517
-Oof!

01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:05.420
Yeah.

01:02:05.422 --> 01:02:07.055
Yeah!

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:09.424
Woo!

01:02:09.426 --> 01:02:11.359
Barry, that's pure, man.

01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:15.363
That is honest, animal rage.

01:02:15.365 --> 01:02:19.234
You feel that, Right?

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:21.837
The three of us, when we're
apart, we're just children.

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:23.238
We're making a mess of things.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.776
But together we're like a
90-year-old desert guru.

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:28.610
Nah, fuck that.

01:02:28.612 --> 01:02:29.611
It multiplies.

01:02:29.613 --> 01:02:31.146
We're 30 times 30 times 30.

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:33.482
What is that, Barry?

01:02:33.484 --> 01:02:34.449
-Who cares, man?

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:35.183
-Count it up.

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:37.652
That's 2,700.

01:02:37.654 --> 01:02:39.154
-It's 27,000.

01:02:39.156 --> 01:02:42.324
-2,700 year-old-man.

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:44.593
We're older than Christ.

01:02:44.595 --> 01:02:45.660
We're older than Socrates.

01:02:45.662 --> 01:02:50.165
We're older than fucking Buddha.

01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:52.434
Let's take that right here.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:53.568
Let's make the album.

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:56.037
Three nights in the desert.

01:02:56.039 --> 01:02:58.406
-I don't even play anymore, man.

01:02:58.408 --> 01:02:59.407
-That's great.

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:00.575
That's great.

01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:01.910
The nameless is
the eternally real.

01:03:01.912 --> 01:03:03.745
You-- you're making
artistic choices,

01:03:03.747 --> 01:03:05.213
and you don't even know it, man!

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:06.948
-Look, Travis.

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:09.851
Listen, give us our stuff back.

01:03:09.853 --> 01:03:11.319
I'll go home.

01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:14.589
We'll chalk this whole up
thing up to desert fever.

01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:16.691
Come on.

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:19.060
And when I get
back, I'll call you.

01:03:19.062 --> 01:03:20.896
And we'll talk about
the idea for the tour.

01:03:20.898 --> 01:03:26.968
I-- I know it's nuts, but
the offer still stands.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.403
-I don't need a sympathy job.

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:29.704
-It's not a sympathy job.

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:33.575
It's a real gig for money.

01:03:33.577 --> 01:03:34.276
-Anna, I can't.

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.047
-Wh-- why not?

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:40.882
-I don't want to get into it.

01:03:40.884 --> 01:03:42.517
-Come on, Travis.

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:43.118
-Say it.

01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:52.761
-I don't like you music.

01:03:52.763 --> 01:03:53.361
I don't.

01:03:56.532 --> 01:04:00.368
You took the stuff we were
working on and you-- you

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:02.170
popped it up.

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.239
You put a syncopated
dance beat to it.

01:04:04.241 --> 01:04:07.309
You sugar coated it.

01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:08.743
Digestible.

01:04:08.745 --> 01:04:09.544
Not you.

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:13.782
Hey, but it was your big break.

01:04:13.784 --> 01:04:16.484
I get it.

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:17.452
-You know what?

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:20.555
You think you're a genius.

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:24.192
You're just talented.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.161
I might not be
reinventing the form,

01:04:26.163 --> 01:04:28.296
but at least I've
done something.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.334
-You asked me.

01:04:32.336 --> 01:04:34.169
-This is what you
do to your friends?

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:40.141
What does it take to
get your approval, man?

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:42.277
She nursed you in the
hospital for three months

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.713
after your doped up ass
wrapped a car around a tree.

01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:45.747
-OK.

01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:46.848
-Her whole album is about you.

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:47.582
-I know that.

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:55.357
-I'm done.

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:56.324
I want to go home.

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:09.871
-Why are you screaming
in the night?

01:05:09.873 --> 01:05:11.773
-Come on, Travis.

01:05:11.775 --> 01:05:14.609
Please, I just want to go home.

01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:18.446
-I know how powerful it is.

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:21.549
I gave my uncle everything
and he showed me

01:05:21.551 --> 01:05:23.885
that place in return.

01:05:23.887 --> 01:05:25.420
-Please, I just want
to get out of here.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.455
-There's plenty of time
before your flight,

01:05:27.457 --> 01:05:28.823
so go back in the cave.

01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:31.626
Figure things out.

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:33.228
You know what you need to do.

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:42.604
-OK.

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:46.574
OK.

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:11.933
-So uh, there's one thing you
should know before you go in.

01:06:11.935 --> 01:06:15.637
I used your phone to
e-mail Julie the recording.

01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:16.304
Julie, right?

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:17.639
No, you didn't.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:18.473
-I'm not joking.

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:19.574
-Yes, you are.

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:20.342
-No, I'm not.

01:06:20.344 --> 01:06:21.910
-I am?

01:06:21.912 --> 01:06:22.677
-He is.

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:23.445
-I think I am.

01:06:23.447 --> 01:06:25.480
Confusion, uncertainty.

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:28.817
That's what you need
when you go in there.

01:06:28.819 --> 01:06:30.518
You got what you
wanted the first time.

01:06:34.857 --> 01:06:36.825
It's stupid.

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:41.563
-What did you see when
you went in there?

01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:51.239
-Happy?

01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:52.007
-Are you?

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:53.608
-I'm swell, partner.

01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:54.242
-Oh, yeah?

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:56.711
-Then I want you, the
pathologically honest,

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:58.480
to look us in the
eye and tell us

01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:00.915
that you're completely
happy with your life.

01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:02.250
-OK.

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:05.387
-Look at us.

01:07:05.389 --> 01:07:06.721
-All right, guys.

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:08.757
Listen, I'm happy.

01:07:08.759 --> 01:07:09.424
Are you happy?

01:07:09.426 --> 01:07:10.692
-Huh?

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:11.593
Are you happy?

01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:12.460
I'm happy.

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:13.495
Happy, happy, happy.

01:07:13.497 --> 01:07:15.997
-I'm not happy, but
I want you to say

01:07:15.999 --> 01:07:20.035
that I'm completely
happy with my life.

01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:22.504
-I'm completely
happy with my life.

01:07:22.506 --> 01:07:25.640
I'm completely
happy with my life.

01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:26.741
All right, rock wall.

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:27.909
Hi, rock wall.

01:07:27.911 --> 01:07:29.577
I'm completely
happy with my life.

01:07:29.579 --> 01:07:30.812
How are you today?

01:07:30.814 --> 01:07:32.047
Are you happy with your life?

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:33.481
-That's not going
to cut it, man.

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:35.583
-I'm completely
happy with my life.

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:36.251
Better now?

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:37.519
-No?

01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:40.255
This is fucking ridiculous.

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.162
You think I don't love Julie.

01:07:47.164 --> 01:07:48.830
-Are you telling me
you never had a doubt?

01:07:48.832 --> 01:07:50.165
-What do you know about choices?

01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:51.499
What do you know about
marriage or commitment

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:52.901
to anything that's
actually attainable?

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:54.302
-What about you, man?

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:56.004
I mean, you could train
yourself to want anything.

01:07:56.006 --> 01:07:57.605
A golden fucking cube.

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:58.940
-That was a joke.

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:01.576
-You know what wasn't a joke?

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.511
What happened last night.

01:08:03.513 --> 01:08:04.746
-OK, I screwed up.

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:06.281
I'm disgusting.

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:07.348
I-- and that's something I
got to work out within myself.

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:08.716
-Barry, I'm judging you, man.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:14.489
-Do you know why I didn't
invite you to my wedding?

01:08:14.491 --> 01:08:18.059
It wasn't because I was
afraid you'd make a scene

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:20.194
or steal Julie, no.

01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:22.831
I was afraid you'd
say she's boring

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:25.100
because you're so judgmental.

01:08:25.102 --> 01:08:26.501
Or you'd say, she's nice.

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:29.002
Or you wouldn't say
anything at all.

01:08:29.005 --> 01:08:30.638
Because you're so
fucking judgmental.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.207
Barry.

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:34.008
I saw the world through
your eyes for way too long.

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:35.609
And I made a choice.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:37.377
I wanted something
different for my life.

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:38.947
Man, I get it, you know.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.548
It's biological, I think.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:43.751
You know, you're-- certain point
you're supposed to stop hanging

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:45.086
out with friends.

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.220
Yeah, you're supposed
to become a functioning

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:47.654
member of society.

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:49.557
You're supposed to churn
out babies and punch fucking

01:08:49.559 --> 01:08:52.160
numbers and ride the
train and cash in.

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:52.861
Yeah, baby!

01:08:52.863 --> 01:08:53.995
I get it.

01:08:53.997 --> 01:08:56.531
-You have no place
to go, do you?

01:08:56.533 --> 01:09:00.902
I'm completely happy
with you not in my life.

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.069
-Yeah.

01:09:02.072 --> 01:09:03.270
-You're an asshole.

01:09:03.273 --> 01:09:04.872
Yeah, I'm
a fucking asshole.

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:06.140
Anna?

01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:07.341
The world
needs fucking assholes!

01:09:10.514 --> 01:09:11.880
Anna, wait.

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:20.854
Anna.

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:24.559
Anna.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.394
Wait, Anna!

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:26.794
-Travis?

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:36.738
-Travis?

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:39.140
Let me see.

01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:40.008
-Oh, I'm good.

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:40.707
I'm fine.

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:41.408
I'm fine.

01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:42.510
I'm good.

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:49.484
-It was just what I dreamed.

01:09:53.488 --> 01:09:54.889
A cave.

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:56.491
I wanted you to hurt.

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:03.264
I wanted you to
hurt like I've hurt.

01:10:03.266 --> 01:10:06.467
This is what I wanted.

01:10:06.469 --> 01:10:08.469
-No.

01:10:08.471 --> 01:10:09.871
-It is.

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:10.505
-No.

01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:11.272
-It is.

01:10:11.274 --> 01:10:12.907
-I made it up, OK?

01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:15.210
I made up the whole cave thing.

01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:16.878
I thought it'd be
cool and mysterious.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.048
I thought it
would-- I thought it

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:22.884
would make us miss each other.

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:23.484
Yeah.

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:33.228
-I don't care about the cave.

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:34.829
I don't care.

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:35.830
This is what's real.

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:38.233
-Anna.

01:10:38.235 --> 01:10:41.603
-When you were in the
hospital recovering,

01:10:41.605 --> 01:10:45.540
those were the best moments
of our relationship.

01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:49.877
You looked at me
like you needed me.

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:55.617
-I need to tell you something.

01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:56.584
Both of you.

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:03.291
I tried writing,
calling, you were

01:11:03.293 --> 01:11:05.526
gonna move half way
across the country,

01:11:05.528 --> 01:11:10.331
and uh-- I was losing it.

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:11.833
Yeah, I was hopped up on pills.

01:11:11.835 --> 01:11:14.902
And yeah, it was dark.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:21.542
But I saw that tree.

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:26.514
I saw it.

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.458
It was telling me to hit it.

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:43.231
Hit it and I'd be redeemed.

01:11:43.233 --> 01:11:46.000
We'd- we'd all be redeemed.

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:53.808
It was music.

01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:57.512
I was listening.

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:04.385
I went for it.

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:12.360
I went for the shiny
fucking marble.

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:17.065
I went into it.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.806
I'm sorry.

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:34.242
Back in the day, I thought
I was a Jaguar doing 100

01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:35.009
down the freeway.

01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:43.384
And you, you were a beat up
old Toyota not exactly sure

01:13:43.386 --> 01:13:44.919
where you were heading.

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:51.559
But I had the feeling that
when you got there, you'd stay.

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.330
-And now?

01:13:56.332 --> 01:13:59.300
-Shit.

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:00.501
You got somewhere.

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:06.641
Man, you could trade
it for a whole fleet.

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:08.543
-You should see my bills.

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:35.770
-You're good.

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:43.778
You went back to school
and put in the time.

01:14:46.448 --> 01:14:48.616
And now you're set
to reap the rewards.

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:54.088
Maybe in my next life I'll
come back as a hardworking Jew.

01:14:57.025 --> 01:14:59.627
-There are some people that
might find that offensive.

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:04.031
-Yeah.

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:07.735
I'm just glad you found
what's right for you.

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:16.944
You remember the
way back, right?

01:15:16.946 --> 01:15:18.613
It's just one road.

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:28.089
You want to know why I
never went in that cave?

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:33.160
I was afraid to find
out what I needed.

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:38.566
-Thought you made it up.

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:43.538
-Yeah.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.568
When
Travis said he'd hitch a ride

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:50.705
and pick up the
truck in a few days.

01:16:50.707 --> 01:16:54.241
I knew that look.

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:55.810
He was deep back in it.

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:02.917
I kept thinking about the cave.

01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:06.587
Maybe we did get what
we needed that weekend.

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:08.122
We finally let go.

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:14.328
Travis used to say
it's all a song.

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:17.765
We never did find that bridge.

01:17:17.767 --> 01:17:19.367
Maybe one day we will.
