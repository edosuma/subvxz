00:00.705 --> 00:02.074
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.075 --> 00:03.580
You mean you don't recognize me?

00:03.581 --> 00:05.407
Klaus: It's been
a long time, Finn.

00:05.408 --> 00:07.084
Hayley and I will return home.

00:07.085 --> 00:08.899
Elijah will remain
here with you.

00:08.900 --> 00:10.913
He's been experiencing
some side effects

00:10.914 --> 00:13.489
since his ordeal as
our mother's captive.

00:13.490 --> 00:15.984
You ready to do this
thing, get hitched?

00:15.985 --> 00:18.332
It's a mystical
unification ceremony.

00:18.333 --> 00:20.355
Hayley: You wolves are here
because you want freedom.

00:20.356 --> 00:21.857
Marcel: My vamps and
I are willing to stand

00:21.858 --> 00:23.257
with you against the witches.

00:23.259 --> 00:25.560
You're brokering a truce.

00:25.561 --> 00:27.596
Did he really just
trap us all in here?

00:27.597 --> 00:28.864
Aah!

00:28.865 --> 00:30.899
Finn: Those vampires
even attempt to feed,

00:30.900 --> 00:32.868
they'll find themselves
unable to stop.

00:32.869 --> 00:35.670
Kol: What Davina and I can do
is cast a disruption spell.

00:35.671 --> 00:37.806
It'll give us 60 seconds
to escape

00:37.807 --> 00:39.774
once the boundary is shut down.

00:39.775 --> 00:41.710
Jack, now.
Go.

00:41.711 --> 00:43.812
Klaus: Slight change
of plans, brother.

00:43.813 --> 00:45.013
They'll kill him.

00:45.014 --> 00:46.081
He should've thought about that

00:46.082 --> 00:47.115
before he betrayed our sister.

00:47.116 --> 00:48.817
Yaah!
Barrier is back up,

00:48.818 --> 00:52.419
and those vampires
look so hungry.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:05.366 --> 01:07.836
I've searched the entire
French quarter.

01:07.837 --> 01:09.436
Finn has vanished.

01:09.438 --> 01:11.005
I can't remove the barrier
that has you trapped

01:11.006 --> 01:12.974
until I have my hand
around this throat.

01:12.975 --> 01:15.310
I was hoping you had a plan "B."

01:15.311 --> 01:16.511
Klaus: Davina.

01:16.512 --> 01:17.845
She doesn't know it yet,

01:17.846 --> 01:19.180
but she's gonna help me
break his spell.

01:19.181 --> 01:21.516
Your job...
Keep Kol alive,

01:21.517 --> 01:24.318
at least until we learn
Rebekah's whereabouts.

01:27.122 --> 01:29.356
Nngh!
Aagh!

01:30.691 --> 01:32.326
Are you listening to me?

01:32.327 --> 01:35.263
Yeah. That all sounds
fine and good, but listen.

01:35.264 --> 01:38.131
When I was getting the
werewolves out, I got bit.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.437
I will get you my blood.

01:43.438 --> 01:46.073
I will get you out of
that house, Marcellus,

01:46.074 --> 01:48.875
whatever it takes.

02:04.825 --> 02:09.029
You are not leaving this
bloody house, Marcel.

02:09.030 --> 02:11.932
My enlistment papers
say otherwise.

02:11.933 --> 02:14.034
369th regiment.

02:14.035 --> 02:15.836
They call them
the Harlem Hellfighters.

02:15.837 --> 02:17.571
Boat leaves tomorrow.

02:17.572 --> 02:20.373
Is this lunacy because
I forbid you to be with Rebekah?

02:21.709 --> 02:24.411
So now you're going off
to fight the Germans.

02:24.412 --> 02:29.817
Fine. Go, but remember,
Marcel, this is your home.

02:29.818 --> 02:31.652
I am your family,
and if you haven't

02:31.653 --> 02:34.355
learned that in the century
since I took you in,

02:34.356 --> 02:36.890
then learn it now!

02:36.891 --> 02:39.226
Family are not just
people who coddle you,

02:39.227 --> 02:41.227
who grant you your every whim.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.096
They are people
who fight for you,

02:43.097 --> 02:45.833
who you fight for,
and if this family

02:45.834 --> 02:47.568
endeavors to stop you
from making

02:47.569 --> 02:50.237
a tragic error of the heart,
then, by all means,

02:50.238 --> 02:54.308
express your discontent,
but what you do not do

02:54.309 --> 02:57.910
is abandon us.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.320
Fine.
Go.

03:06.321 --> 03:08.588
You'll be back.

03:08.589 --> 03:12.125
The prodigal son
always returns home.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.061
Mm...

03:27.841 --> 03:32.950
Yeah. I'm home, all right,
the last place I want to be.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.561
Kol: What's with
the church bells?

03:48.562 --> 03:52.532
Sounds like the preamble
of me own bloody funeral.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.133
It's carillon eve.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.668
The locals shroud
the eyes of angels

03:55.669 --> 03:58.972
so the dead can walk among us
for a night without judgment.

03:58.973 --> 04:02.442
The bells wake the dead
and guide them to eternal rest.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.810
So whether you live
or die today,

04:03.811 --> 04:05.845
you can join the festivities.

04:05.846 --> 04:09.481
Oh, Marcel, you're gonna
make certain I live.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.951
I'm the only one who knows
how to find Rebekah.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.319
Think you underestimate
how hungry I am

04:13.320 --> 04:14.586
and how much I'd like to appease

04:14.588 --> 04:16.322
my hungry friends
right outside that door.

04:16.322 --> 04:19.357
And just what would
Davina say about that?

04:19.358 --> 04:21.127
Because I'm not one
to kiss and tell,

04:21.128 --> 04:24.430
obviously,
but I think she likes me.

04:24.431 --> 04:30.635
Watch your mouth before I drain
every vein of yours myself.

05:01.867 --> 05:03.535
Joe?

05:03.536 --> 05:05.070
Hey, corporal.

05:17.015 --> 05:19.485
You're a bit of a mystery, son.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.287
Just another soldier
like you, brother.

05:22.288 --> 05:25.824
Yeah? Not just like me.
See, I've been watching you.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.392
Yeah.
Yeah.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.861
I've seen you take
bullets to the gut.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.062
Next minute, you're
pulling guys back

05:30.063 --> 05:31.930
to the trench like
nothing ever happened.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.899
Yes, sir, a mystery,
but with mysteries

05:33.900 --> 05:36.033
come theories, and I got two.

05:36.035 --> 05:37.769
One, you got guardian angels

05:37.770 --> 05:39.972
patching you up
every time you get shot.

05:39.973 --> 05:44.041
Two, you're something
else altogether.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.377
Man: Move, move!

05:45.378 --> 05:47.012
Different man: Listen up, men.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.780
Headquarters said there aren't
enough gas masks

05:48.781 --> 05:50.115
for the whole unit.

05:50.116 --> 05:52.050
Without a mask,
we're dead in hours.

05:52.051 --> 05:53.885
Have you forgotten
what they call us?

05:53.886 --> 05:55.686
We're the brotherhood
of the damned

05:55.688 --> 05:56.954
because we've been
set up to fail.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.290
We're cannon fodder.

05:58.291 --> 05:59.991
We're meant to stall,
not to stop the enemy.

05:59.992 --> 06:01.525
Now, hold on, major.

06:01.527 --> 06:04.028
Our line has held longer
than any on the western front.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.864
They call us brotherhood
of the damned because

06:05.865 --> 06:07.565
everyone here would
rather be damned

06:07.566 --> 06:09.500
than let the enemy
break this line.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.803
If you don't know that,
then we need a leader who does.

06:11.804 --> 06:12.937
You listen here, private.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.974
Major.

06:15.975 --> 06:17.475
Get down.

06:26.618 --> 06:28.186
Listen here.

06:28.187 --> 06:30.655
I don't care what you are
or how you do what you do,

06:30.656 --> 06:33.391
but I believe you're
here for a reason, hey...

06:33.392 --> 06:38.095
To be that leader
you just talked about.

06:39.497 --> 06:41.933
So what's it gonna be, Marcel?

06:48.172 --> 06:51.808
Gia: Marcel? Marcel!

06:54.212 --> 06:56.214
You all right?

06:56.215 --> 07:01.184
Yeah. Just hungry.
That's all.

07:05.790 --> 07:08.693
Haven't you found Finn yet?

07:08.694 --> 07:11.162
I must say, for a witch
of your caliber,

07:11.163 --> 07:13.130
your spells are not
particularly efficient.

07:13.131 --> 07:15.399
Finn is blocking
my locator spell.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.934
So I'm trying something new,

07:16.935 --> 07:19.003
but I need to concentrate,
and it would help a lot

07:19.004 --> 07:21.539
if you would stop standing
over me like a stalker.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.274
No need to be testy, luv.

07:23.275 --> 07:24.942
We both have the same goal.

07:24.943 --> 07:27.144
Really? Because my goal
is to get Kol

07:27.145 --> 07:29.613
out of your house alive,
which seems to be

07:29.614 --> 07:31.048
about number 10 on your list.

07:31.049 --> 07:32.582
Number 9 at least.

07:32.584 --> 07:34.351
What is wrong with you?
He's your brother.

07:34.352 --> 07:36.187
Yes, and I also have a sister,

07:36.188 --> 07:38.222
one who I happen
to care about more.

07:38.223 --> 07:40.057
So until he tells me
where she is,

07:40.058 --> 07:41.525
Kol can rot, as far
as I'm concerned,

07:41.526 --> 07:42.960
and you might want
to get your villains

07:42.961 --> 07:46.162
straight, luv, because Finn
is the architect of this fiasco.

07:46.164 --> 07:47.531
So pick up the pace.

07:47.532 --> 07:48.866
Find out where he's
getting his power from

07:48.867 --> 07:51.567
so we can stop it.

08:03.614 --> 08:06.450
I saw glimpses of him.

08:06.451 --> 08:09.686
He's combining
sacred objects, totems,

08:09.687 --> 08:11.622
representational magic.

08:11.623 --> 08:14.256
Where?

08:15.826 --> 08:19.863
Lafayette number 1,
the Lyonne tomb.

08:19.864 --> 08:21.864
And what's he using?

08:25.635 --> 08:28.171
He's channeling your parents.

08:28.172 --> 08:30.674
And here, I thought
I was the poster child

08:30.675 --> 08:32.775
for least grateful offspring.

08:36.179 --> 08:40.115
Well then, shall you and I go
crash their little party?

08:44.187 --> 08:46.055
Now who needs
to pick up the pace?

08:53.753 --> 08:56.599
Cami: Our goal here is to
confront your subconscious.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.035
An element of my thesis
is on suppression

08:59.036 --> 09:01.471
of past trauma
and how it can manifest

09:01.472 --> 09:04.206
in aberrant and often
violent behavior.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.209
You know, I believe it was 1897

09:06.210 --> 09:08.812
that a dear friend of mine...

09:08.813 --> 09:10.280
Let's just call him
the godfather

09:10.281 --> 09:11.915
of modern psychoanalysis...
Mentioned something

09:11.916 --> 09:14.984
similar to me over tea
in a Viennese cafe.

09:16.487 --> 09:19.956
Are you namedropping
Freud right now?

09:19.957 --> 09:24.193
Ok. Well, here's something
I know that even Freud didn't...

09:24.194 --> 09:25.595
Oh, do tell.

09:25.596 --> 09:26.796
What it's like when
someone takes away

09:26.797 --> 09:30.833
your deepest, ugliest pain
without your consent.

09:30.834 --> 09:36.873
It is both a blessed relief
and a complete violation.

09:36.874 --> 09:39.976
Sound familiar?

09:39.977 --> 09:41.477
Good. Let's start
with what you've

09:41.478 --> 09:43.946
referred to as the red door.

09:43.947 --> 09:49.685
That's an image
from my past, my youth.

09:49.686 --> 09:55.091
It was the door
to a slaughterhouse.

09:55.092 --> 09:58.728
Sometimes it appears
to me in flashes.

09:58.729 --> 10:02.865
It's a memory, but
it's also a metaphor.

10:02.866 --> 10:07.203
It's a place where unspeakable
deeds dwell in darkness.

10:07.204 --> 10:10.506
And have there been many?

10:10.507 --> 10:12.007
Look, Camille.

10:12.008 --> 10:14.777
You know I'm no
stranger to violence.

10:14.778 --> 10:19.982
Typically, however, I am
possessed of a certain control.

10:19.983 --> 10:23.952
However, now and then, I can
become consumed with chaos

10:23.954 --> 10:26.821
and untethered
from that control.

10:29.491 --> 10:35.030
This is where the deeds
are concealed, behind that door.

10:35.031 --> 10:37.666
Why that particular door?

10:37.667 --> 10:40.169
This is where the first
woman I ever loved

10:40.170 --> 10:42.503
told me she loved me in return.

10:44.940 --> 10:48.509
It's also where I laid her
body after I took her life.

10:50.746 --> 10:54.815
No one knows this,
not even Niklaus.

10:54.817 --> 10:58.587
My brother loved Tatia
as deeply as I did.

10:58.588 --> 11:02.324
He still believes
that mother killed her,

11:02.325 --> 11:05.193
and not only is this a lie.

11:05.194 --> 11:07.529
This is a lie of my creation,

11:07.530 --> 11:10.031
and my brother doesn't forgive.

11:10.032 --> 11:13.802
He doesn't forget.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.637
Therefore, I think
it's best that I forget

11:15.638 --> 11:17.972
for both of our sakes.

11:21.209 --> 11:22.376
Elijah?

11:26.948 --> 11:29.284
Elijah?

11:29.285 --> 11:32.153
What the hell is
wrong with Marcel?

11:32.154 --> 11:33.822
I don't know.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.422
I can't even think straight,
I'm so freaking hungry.

11:35.424 --> 11:36.825
We're all hungry.

11:40.762 --> 11:43.565
Kol: You come anywhere near me,

11:43.566 --> 11:46.167
and I will give you a headache
that will last a century.

11:46.168 --> 11:47.435
It'll be worth it.

11:47.436 --> 11:49.269
Waah!
Hey!

11:49.271 --> 11:50.872
Ohh...

11:50.873 --> 11:54.209
Anyone care to explain
what's going on?

11:54.210 --> 11:57.911
Your so-called protection
detail was trying to eat me.

11:59.948 --> 12:01.749
So I think I should
teach them a lesson.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.818
Aah!

12:05.653 --> 12:09.189
Josh: Uh, what just happened?

12:13.761 --> 12:16.096
Niklaus.

12:22.470 --> 12:24.038
You two?

12:24.039 --> 12:27.440
What is this?

12:30.811 --> 12:33.113
It's a chambre de chasse...

12:34.315 --> 12:35.750
A hunt room.

12:35.751 --> 12:37.018
It's where witches
bring their prey

12:37.019 --> 12:38.953
for mental target practice.

12:38.954 --> 12:40.755
Our bodies are in the real world

12:40.756 --> 12:43.124
laid on the floor whilst
our minds are in here,

12:43.125 --> 12:47.962
represented by these
damn animal heads.

12:47.963 --> 12:50.331
Let me take a wild guess
as to who's the author

12:50.332 --> 12:52.233
of this nightmare.

12:52.234 --> 12:56.202
Finn, show yourself.

13:02.243 --> 13:04.144
Save your strength.

13:04.145 --> 13:06.914
In here, I am untouchable.

13:06.915 --> 13:09.383
My magic, my rules.

13:09.384 --> 13:13.487
So make yourselves at home.

13:13.488 --> 13:16.656
We're gonna be here for a while.

13:24.081 --> 13:26.683
Well, that's the last of them.

13:26.684 --> 13:29.119
Everyone out here is
officially ring-free.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.621
And better off.

13:30.622 --> 13:32.356
It's easier for you
to say. You're a hybrid.

13:32.357 --> 13:34.391
I'm back to turning
every single full moon,

13:34.392 --> 13:37.027
and if the wolves who are loyal
to Finn come back here,

13:37.028 --> 13:38.795
they're gonna rip
right through us.

13:38.796 --> 13:41.498
So I got to ask,
when's this wedding?

13:41.499 --> 13:42.900
10 days.

13:42.901 --> 13:44.868
After that, Hayley's power
is your power.

13:44.869 --> 13:47.070
The full moon
won't control you anymore.

13:47.071 --> 13:48.539
Spread the word.

13:48.540 --> 13:50.374
Any wolf who wants in
needs to be here

13:50.375 --> 13:52.375
to bear witness to the wedding.

13:52.377 --> 13:54.077
Yeah.
I can do that.

13:54.078 --> 13:55.412
What are you guys gonna do?

13:55.413 --> 13:58.081
We are going to meet an elder.

13:58.082 --> 14:01.283
We need and old-school crescent
wolf to conduct the wedding.

14:01.285 --> 14:04.955
Then there are the trials.
don't worry.

14:04.956 --> 14:07.324
We say a few oaths,
do some trust falls,

14:07.325 --> 14:10.260
smoke a little blue calamus
root out of a peace pipe...

14:10.261 --> 14:11.660
Piece of cake.

14:13.730 --> 14:16.599
Hmm. Well, good luck with that.

14:19.029 --> 14:22.138
Any idea where
we can find an elder?

14:22.139 --> 14:24.474
Well, that depends.

14:24.475 --> 14:27.276
You got any interest
in meeting my grandma?

14:29.123 --> 14:32.482
Davina: Wake up.
Wake up.

14:34.352 --> 14:36.319
The one time I need you.

14:45.396 --> 14:47.030
Cami?

14:47.031 --> 14:50.032
Davina, why are you
answering Klaus' phone?

14:50.034 --> 14:51.801
Because I can't wake him up.

14:51.802 --> 14:53.303
What? Elijah collapsed, too.

14:53.304 --> 14:55.505
What's going on?

14:55.506 --> 14:57.306
Oh, I'm an idiot.

14:57.308 --> 15:01.978
The spell Finn used
was to trap his brothers,

15:01.979 --> 15:03.980
meaning Kol is in trouble.

15:03.981 --> 15:06.015
What do we do?

15:06.016 --> 15:09.619
I have no idea.

15:09.620 --> 15:13.222
Finn: At the very least,
this prison

15:13.223 --> 15:15.324
is a bit more comfortable
than the box

15:15.325 --> 15:18.628
you held me in
for almost 900 years.

15:18.629 --> 15:21.797
Oh, the heads are a nice touch.

15:21.798 --> 15:25.935
Let me guess...
I'm the big bad wolf,

15:25.936 --> 15:29.037
Kol the wily fox.

15:29.039 --> 15:31.173
Elijah is the noble stag,

15:31.174 --> 15:35.645
and you, fittingly enough,
are the boar,

15:35.646 --> 15:39.515
bit obvious as far
as symbolism goes.

15:39.516 --> 15:42.451
Why are we here?
don't tell me.

15:42.452 --> 15:44.887
It's about mother.

15:44.888 --> 15:46.655
I didn't force her
to drink blood

15:46.656 --> 15:48.089
and betray everything
she holds dear.

15:48.091 --> 15:49.592
That was her choice.

15:49.593 --> 15:51.894
This isn't about mother.
This is about you.

15:51.895 --> 15:54.862
I want you to know how it feels
to be powerless.

15:54.864 --> 15:57.867
So I'm gonna take the thing
that matters most to you...

15:57.868 --> 15:59.869
The city you've come
to love so much.

15:59.870 --> 16:01.437
Elijah: Are we quite done here?

16:01.438 --> 16:04.740
You will release us now.

16:04.741 --> 16:09.178
I will...
After sundown

16:09.179 --> 16:11.380
because at sundown,
when the marchers

16:11.381 --> 16:14.450
of carillon eve
take to the streets,

16:14.451 --> 16:17.352
my barrier spell drops.

16:17.353 --> 16:20.789
Marcel and his hungry vampires
will be unleashed

16:20.790 --> 16:23.091
to kill their way
through the quarter.

16:23.092 --> 16:25.527
I imagine that
after their atrocities,

16:25.528 --> 16:27.362
supernatural community
of New Orleans

16:27.363 --> 16:29.765
will be forced to find
another place to call home.

16:29.766 --> 16:31.433
Kol: Look. I don't
care about the city.

16:31.434 --> 16:34.136
What I care about is
that my very human body

16:34.137 --> 16:36.805
is laying at the feet of
some very hungry vampires.

16:36.806 --> 16:39.107
Your fight is with them.
It's not with me.

16:39.108 --> 16:41.542
All you care about
is your own fragile mortality,

16:41.544 --> 16:43.512
but what is you
were made vulnerable?

16:43.513 --> 16:47.681
What then?

16:54.991 --> 16:56.491
All right.
Easy, easy.

16:56.492 --> 16:57.893
If you start feeding,
you won't be able to stop,

16:57.894 --> 16:59.327
and then he's dead,
and the rest of us

16:59.328 --> 17:00.595
still starve, all right?

17:00.596 --> 17:01.796
Look at me.

17:01.797 --> 17:05.666
I have been at war in the trenches
starved with my men.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.502
If we fought through
it then, you can now.

17:08.503 --> 17:11.605
We are gonna fight
this hunger together.

17:31.526 --> 17:35.163
No gas mask or rations,
but we got plenty of cocoa.

17:35.164 --> 17:38.865
Hmm, more dirt than cocoa,
but it'll do.

17:40.068 --> 17:42.636
Corporal, sir...

17:43.438 --> 17:47.207
I know you're starving.

17:50.311 --> 17:52.713
Never one of us.

17:52.714 --> 17:54.582
Catch me a German,
and then we'll talk.

17:54.583 --> 17:56.551
Man: Corporal...

17:56.552 --> 17:59.420
You're needed back
at headquarters, sit.

17:59.421 --> 18:01.255
All right.

18:15.036 --> 18:17.504
Hate the war.

18:18.572 --> 18:20.874
Love the hats.

18:22.076 --> 18:24.712
Klaus, what are you doing here?

18:24.713 --> 18:27.014
Well, you left before
such a delicious meal,

18:27.015 --> 18:30.717
I thought I'd bring you dessert.

18:40.427 --> 18:43.797
Oh, go on.
You know you want to.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.868
Klaus: Have your fill...

18:50.771 --> 18:54.641
And then come home
to New Orleans.

18:57.345 --> 18:59.246
I have to get back to my men.

18:59.247 --> 19:01.114
Your men?

19:01.115 --> 19:03.784
don't be so bloody
ridiculous, Marcel.

19:03.785 --> 19:05.619
Let the food fight
amongst themselves

19:05.620 --> 19:07.287
if you must,
but make no mistake.

19:07.288 --> 19:10.057
Your place is at home
with your family.

19:10.058 --> 19:12.693
You once told me that
family are the people

19:12.694 --> 19:15.629
who you fight for and those
willing to fight for you.

19:15.630 --> 19:19.832
So you go home, Klaus.
I am with family.

19:31.174 --> 19:34.814
Hey, are you ok?

19:37.848 --> 19:39.519
Hey.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.220
Oh, my God.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.589
Is that a werewolf bite?

19:42.590 --> 19:44.457
It's a scratch.
It's a bite.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.259
You're 6 ways to dead if you
don't get Klaus' blood in you,

19:46.260 --> 19:47.594
and when those guys find out...

19:47.595 --> 19:49.663
They're not gonna
find out, which means

19:49.664 --> 19:51.598
you're gonna keep your
mouth shut about this,

19:51.599 --> 19:53.633
and you are gonna
shut yours, period.

20:13.175 --> 20:15.588
You hear that?

20:15.589 --> 20:18.691
That's the sound of food
that we can't even get near

20:18.692 --> 20:21.294
while you're sitting here
protecting that idiot.

20:21.295 --> 20:23.496
It is just hunger, Gia.

20:23.497 --> 20:24.764
Lots of people on this earth

20:24.765 --> 20:26.331
have been a lot
hungrier than us.

20:26.333 --> 20:28.468
You made us a promise
when you turned us.

20:28.469 --> 20:31.871
You had goals we bought
into, but look at us.

20:31.872 --> 20:33.806
We've been wolf bait, beaten up,

20:33.807 --> 20:35.207
stuck exiled across the river,

20:35.209 --> 20:37.543
then stuck here,
and now when we're

20:37.544 --> 20:39.312
all looking to you for help,

20:39.313 --> 20:41.981
you don't even tell us
that you're dying.

20:41.982 --> 20:44.183
You're supposed
to be our leader,

20:44.184 --> 20:47.552
but right now, you suck at it.

21:12.411 --> 21:17.448
We don't all get to get
out of this alive, son.

21:32.671 --> 21:38.756
Ok. Point made, but nobody
loves a joke more

21:38.757 --> 21:40.424
than old fox boy here,
but if you could just

21:40.425 --> 21:41.759
get me back to my body...

21:41.760 --> 21:44.061
Elijah: I must confess,
I rather enjoy

21:44.062 --> 21:46.897
watching you twist in the wind,

21:46.898 --> 21:48.666
not unlike the way
you left Rebekah,

21:48.667 --> 21:50.266
I imagine.
Yes.

21:50.268 --> 21:51.702
What did you do to Rebekah?

21:51.703 --> 21:53.571
For goodness' sake,
she crossed me.

21:53.572 --> 21:55.172
So I crossed her back.

21:55.173 --> 21:56.807
Look. If you could just
get me back to my body,

21:56.808 --> 22:00.477
I will tell anybody anything
that they need to know.

22:00.478 --> 22:02.880
How narrow-minded of me.

22:02.881 --> 22:05.516
Rebekah, you don't
know where she is,

22:05.517 --> 22:08.285
and the only thing standing
between you and our sister

22:08.286 --> 22:12.455
is this selfish fool.

22:12.457 --> 22:15.592
Hmm. Maybe it's time
that you go enjoy

22:15.593 --> 22:18.861
the rest of your mortal life
while you still can.

22:26.837 --> 22:30.886
Is it too late for an apology?

22:34.344 --> 22:35.746
Thanks, mate.

22:35.747 --> 22:36.847
Oh, don't thank me yet.

22:36.848 --> 22:37.915
Whoa! Hold it.

22:37.916 --> 22:40.684
Hold it together just
for a little while longer,

22:40.685 --> 22:43.787
a few minutes, to be exact.

22:43.788 --> 22:47.090
What are you talking about?

22:47.091 --> 22:49.793
Finn.

22:49.794 --> 22:53.463
He plans to release
the lot of you at sundown.

22:53.464 --> 22:57.534
Oh, the streets will be
jam-packed with people

22:57.535 --> 22:59.435
right outside the gate.

22:59.437 --> 23:01.338
You'll be half-crazed
with hunger.

23:01.339 --> 23:02.773
You'll feed your way
through the crowd,

23:02.774 --> 23:04.374
and that'll be the end
of vampires secretly

23:04.375 --> 23:08.844
living off the fat
of New Orleans.

23:11.937 --> 23:14.984
Marcel, listen to me.

23:14.986 --> 23:16.452
You are outmaneuvered,
outmanned,

23:16.454 --> 23:20.523
and, quite frankly,
you're out of your mind.

23:20.524 --> 23:23.727
We're not gonna get
out of this alive.

23:23.728 --> 23:25.095
No.

23:25.096 --> 23:28.063
We are all getting
out of this alive.

23:29.699 --> 23:33.436
Ohh, are we hiking
to baton rouge?

23:33.437 --> 23:35.772
Oh, just a little bit farther.

23:35.773 --> 23:37.273
You nervous?

23:37.274 --> 23:40.176
I'm not nervous,
although I should be.

23:40.177 --> 23:41.678
She is your grandmother.

23:41.679 --> 23:44.414
Yeah. She usually likes
the girls I bring home.

23:44.415 --> 23:46.916
Oh, really? Hmm.

23:46.917 --> 23:49.986
Exactly how many girls have
you brought to meet her?

23:49.987 --> 23:51.721
Ha ha ha! No.

23:51.722 --> 23:53.723
I've never brought
anyone to meet her.

23:53.724 --> 23:56.426
So you have got to make
a good impression

23:56.427 --> 23:59.262
because she got no one
crazy to compare you with.

23:59.263 --> 24:02.465
I am great with old
people and babies.

24:02.466 --> 24:05.301
It's just the in between
that I suck at.

24:05.302 --> 24:07.036
Cute as all this is,
y'all are late.

24:07.037 --> 24:09.405
Grandma Mary...

24:09.406 --> 24:10.907
This is Hayley.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.742
Mary, it is so nice to meet you.

24:12.743 --> 24:15.011
You can turn off your
old people charm now.

24:15.012 --> 24:18.347
The two of you are late,
and we need to get started.

24:18.348 --> 24:20.716
Right. Ahem. Yes.

24:20.717 --> 24:23.385
We have premarital
rituals to attend to,

24:23.387 --> 24:25.488
which are what, exactly?

24:25.489 --> 24:27.323
Fasting, purification,

24:27.324 --> 24:29.458
the rite of divulgement,
to name a few.

24:29.459 --> 24:31.060
The rite of what?

24:31.061 --> 24:33.429
Oh, it's simple.
You speak the truth.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.130
He speaks the truth.

24:35.132 --> 24:37.399
Secrets are cleansed.
Everyone is happy.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.436
What do you mean,
"secrets are cleansed"?

24:40.437 --> 24:45.074
The two alphas smoke the root
of a blue calamus flower.

24:45.075 --> 24:48.777
It links your hearts
and minds together.

24:48.778 --> 24:54.082
The ceremony won't take if there
are lies separating you.

24:54.084 --> 24:55.951
This way, there are none.

24:55.952 --> 24:57.419
It's the most important ritual

24:57.420 --> 24:59.755
apart from the wedding
ceremony itself.

24:59.756 --> 25:02.825
Hope you don't have too
many skeletons in your closet.

25:04.494 --> 25:08.830
I'm not doing that.

25:11.890 --> 25:16.237
I'm sorry.
I can't.

25:19.541 --> 25:22.377
Finn: So what
should we talk about

25:22.378 --> 25:24.545
while we wait for nightfall?

25:24.547 --> 25:27.014
Oh, I know. Let's talk
about our parents.

25:27.016 --> 25:30.018
Now, I figured you
wouldn't be kind to mother,

25:30.019 --> 25:31.953
but imagine my surprise to learn

25:31.954 --> 25:33.755
that Mikael met the same fate.

25:33.756 --> 25:34.990
Bravo, brother.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.224
You see, the parent
I was interested in

25:36.225 --> 25:38.894
talking about was your father,
your real one.

25:38.895 --> 25:40.295
I mean, you longed to know him

25:40.296 --> 25:41.595
your whole life, yet at
the first opportunity,

25:41.597 --> 25:43.565
you murdered him.

25:43.566 --> 25:46.167
Why, I wonder.

25:46.168 --> 25:49.537
Possibly the same reason
you took out Esther.

25:49.538 --> 25:52.474
Severing parental ties
has a way of freeing one up

25:52.475 --> 25:56.110
to recognize one's
true potential.

25:56.112 --> 26:00.248
Finn: Quite...

26:00.249 --> 26:03.718
But Esther was no fool.

26:03.719 --> 26:08.056
She pinpointed your wants,
and knowing your true father

26:08.057 --> 26:10.390
was at the top of the list...

26:13.863 --> 26:17.765
No. Something else
occupies the top

26:17.766 --> 26:22.237
of your list of affections,
and it's not your favorite city

26:22.238 --> 26:25.173
because I'm about
to take it from you

26:25.174 --> 26:26.608
using your own vampires,

26:26.609 --> 26:29.577
and I barely get
a rise out of you.

26:29.578 --> 26:31.446
I thought maybe it was Rebekah,

26:31.447 --> 26:33.615
but you remain calm,
even when the one person

26:33.616 --> 26:36.117
who know her fate
probably just met his.

26:36.118 --> 26:38.286
Elijah: I am fighting
the monumental desire

26:38.287 --> 26:40.620
to mount your severed head
upon one of these walls.

26:40.622 --> 26:42.689
Then I thought
it was your favorite brother,

26:42.691 --> 26:45.626
but mother broke him
into 1,000 pieces,

26:45.627 --> 26:48.362
and rather than fix him,
you left him

26:48.363 --> 26:50.898
to fend for himself
God knows where.

26:50.899 --> 26:52.733
You know,
if I didn't know better,

26:52.734 --> 26:55.937
I'd say you were
hiding something from me,

26:55.938 --> 26:58.973
something big, something dark.

26:58.974 --> 27:01.008
Maybe your real father
found out what it was,

27:01.009 --> 27:02.243
and you had to kill him.

27:02.244 --> 27:04.078
You want to know why
I killed my father?

27:04.079 --> 27:05.212
Yeah.

27:05.213 --> 27:06.647
When blood relations
let me down,

27:06.648 --> 27:08.182
I don't stop
to reason with them.

27:08.183 --> 27:10.618
I remove them.

27:10.619 --> 27:13.454
So the secret is,
there is no secret?

27:13.455 --> 27:16.690
You long for nothing,
care for no one.

27:16.691 --> 27:19.093
Well...

27:19.094 --> 27:21.729
Problem is, brother,
I don't believe you.

27:21.730 --> 27:23.964
It's clear to me that
you're hiding something,

27:23.965 --> 27:26.934
and, as I control
your presence here,

27:26.935 --> 27:28.402
I've got all
the time in the world

27:28.403 --> 27:31.838
to figure out just
what that might be.

27:44.096 --> 27:48.167
Jackson: Hayley.
Hayley? Hayley, wait.

27:48.168 --> 27:49.936
I can't do it, Jack.

27:49.937 --> 27:51.537
You are not the only
one who has stuff

27:51.538 --> 27:52.738
they'd rather not talk about.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.740
Some of my secrets
are not mine to tell.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.675
Maybe a little honesty
is a good thing.

27:56.676 --> 27:59.712
Jack, I like with
the original family.

27:59.713 --> 28:05.250
In that family, sometimes
honesty can get you killed.

28:07.553 --> 28:12.124
We all have things we hope
will never see the light of day.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.660
Now, you probably won't
like what I have to say

28:14.661 --> 28:16.395
any more than what
you're holding back.

28:16.396 --> 28:17.763
I wish that were true.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.931
Well, come back with me.

28:21.300 --> 28:24.036
We'll take it
one step at a time,

28:24.037 --> 28:26.805
and if anything
makes you uncomfortable,

28:26.806 --> 28:29.407
you tell me, and we stop...

28:30.309 --> 28:33.712
And when it comes
time to open up,

28:33.713 --> 28:36.781
I'll go first
because I don't run...

28:38.417 --> 28:40.752
And I don't scare easy.

28:40.753 --> 28:45.857
Your secrets are my secrets,
your demons my demons,

28:45.858 --> 28:49.461
and you'll never have
to fight them alone.

28:49.462 --> 28:53.364
I promise you that.

28:54.966 --> 28:57.468
Please.

29:05.410 --> 29:11.650
Relax. Relax.
Hey, easy.

29:11.651 --> 29:14.085
I'm gonna give you
two minutes to explain

29:14.086 --> 29:19.057
why we don't come up there
and take the witch.

29:19.058 --> 29:20.825
You lied to us.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.393
You betrayed
everything you taught us.

29:22.395 --> 29:23.895
How can you lead us?

29:32.004 --> 29:34.139
Hey.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.576
Joe, Joe, no.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.044
Joe? Joe.

29:40.045 --> 29:42.647
You never did get
those gas masks.

29:42.648 --> 29:44.816
I'm sorry.
I failed you, brother.

29:44.817 --> 29:48.653
Not if you make us
into vampires like you.

29:48.654 --> 29:51.556
Let's make this fight more even.

29:51.557 --> 29:54.224
Turn us.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.876
Hey. Hey!

30:14.079 --> 30:18.482
I am sorry I let you down,
ok, all of you,

30:18.483 --> 30:21.652
but the way that you
are feeling right now...

30:21.653 --> 30:26.023
This despair, this hunger...
I have been through it,

30:26.024 --> 30:29.025
and if you let me help you
survive it, I guarantee you,

30:29.027 --> 30:33.096
it will only make you stronger.

30:33.098 --> 30:35.866
At sundown, Vincent is gonna
drop that barrier spell,

30:35.867 --> 30:38.102
and those doors are gonna open,
and we are gonna be

30:38.103 --> 30:40.871
smack in the middle of a parade
full of innocent people.

30:40.872 --> 30:42.606
We can't fall apart now.

30:42.607 --> 30:45.309
Gia: Innocent, guilty,
we're hungry.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.178
We have to feed.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.446
We don't feed on locals.
That's our rule.

30:49.447 --> 30:51.882
That is how we survived
300 years in this city,

30:51.883 --> 30:54.118
and that is why
we get to call it home,

30:54.119 --> 30:56.987
because we live by a code.

30:56.988 --> 30:58.822
The same one that won't let you

30:58.823 --> 31:03.559
tell your own people that you're
dying of a werewolf bite?

31:07.165 --> 31:09.800
I'm not dying of anything.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.069
I've got a vial of Klaus' blood
in my place

31:12.070 --> 31:14.271
right across the river
along with enough blood

31:14.272 --> 31:16.673
to satisfy all of you.

31:16.674 --> 31:19.910
All we have to do is get there.

31:19.911 --> 31:21.979
You once asked me
what I was fighting for.

31:21.980 --> 31:26.316
I told you I was fighting
for this city, for our home,

31:26.317 --> 31:29.419
but if we feed out there,
we lose it.

31:29.420 --> 31:32.823
The barrier will be down
any moment now.

31:32.824 --> 31:36.092
Let me help you get home.

31:58.615 --> 32:00.049
It's down.

32:02.252 --> 32:03.686
Let's go.

32:16.063 --> 32:19.166
It's a shame, really, for you
to lose New Orleans.

32:19.167 --> 32:21.301
You've worked so hard
to make this city a home.

32:21.302 --> 32:23.503
On the other hand, this city
hasn't given you much

32:23.504 --> 32:25.272
in the way of good fortune.

32:25.273 --> 32:29.208
You had Marcel's betrayal,
father's attack,

32:29.210 --> 32:31.710
loss of your child.

32:34.514 --> 32:39.152
It is a delicate craft,
representational magic.

32:39.153 --> 32:41.521
One must be ever so precise.

32:41.522 --> 32:45.292
If you misrepresent us,
the very enchantment

32:45.293 --> 32:47.093
that this room was built
upon would collapse.

32:47.094 --> 32:48.561
Would it not?

32:48.562 --> 32:50.162
Finn: I assure you, you have not
been misrepresented.

32:50.164 --> 32:54.067
Well, that depends on how well
the hunter knows his prey.

32:54.068 --> 32:57.837
This facade...
This illusion

32:57.838 --> 33:00.807
that I have created over
the course of my life,

33:00.808 --> 33:05.178
the noble stag...
Is nothing more

33:05.179 --> 33:10.350
than a deception to
myself, to everyone,

33:10.351 --> 33:12.919
for, were I truly
noble, brother,

33:12.920 --> 33:14.887
I would not have
withheld from you

33:14.888 --> 33:20.326
a vile deed and one that I,
like a coward, allowed mother

33:20.327 --> 33:23.729
to erase from my memory.

33:25.832 --> 33:27.867
It was I who killed Tatia.

33:30.437 --> 33:35.475
I hunted her down and mercilessly
I feasted upon her flesh.

33:35.476 --> 33:38.611
I tore her from us.

33:38.612 --> 33:41.714
Mother took the blame.

33:41.715 --> 33:46.118
Brother, I felt certain
that if you knew,

33:46.119 --> 33:49.221
you would in no way forgive me.

33:49.222 --> 33:51.057
Finn: The act
may be reprehensible,

33:51.058 --> 33:52.525
but your admitting to it
proves you to be

33:52.526 --> 33:55.127
the man I thought you to be.

33:55.128 --> 33:58.130
My magic stands.
Does it?

33:58.131 --> 34:04.803
It turns out, my brother
is even more depraved than I am.

34:09.909 --> 34:15.447
He is the noble stag no longer,

34:15.447 --> 34:17.949
indeed an altogether
different beast

34:17.951 --> 34:22.755
creeping through the cracks,
and you have also failed

34:22.755 --> 34:24.422
in your representation
of me because there is

34:24.424 --> 34:27.759
one thing you never
thought me capable of...

34:34.166 --> 34:35.634
Forgiveness.

34:40.105 --> 34:45.244
You, Finn, have remained
a boar for centuries,

34:45.245 --> 34:48.480
but here is where
your true fault lies.

34:48.481 --> 34:51.083
You never learnt
that the bonds of family

34:51.083 --> 34:53.516
far outweigh anything else.

34:53.518 --> 34:56.521
Such bonds trump
petty jealousies.

34:56.522 --> 34:59.858
They overcome ancient feuds,
and, yes,

34:59.859 --> 35:05.464
they are capable of allowing
one monster

35:05.465 --> 35:09.333
to pardon the great
sins of another.

35:16.708 --> 35:18.210
How is this possible?

35:18.211 --> 35:20.545
Your magic is as flawed
as your perception

35:20.546 --> 35:22.380
of your own siblings.

35:22.381 --> 35:25.849
I wonder, just how
untouchable are you?

35:29.888 --> 35:32.389
Oh, thank God.
Are you ok?

35:34.058 --> 35:36.227
For now.

35:38.230 --> 35:42.167
What happened?
Is Kol ok?

35:42.168 --> 35:44.903
I'm fine. Thank you
for your concern.

35:44.904 --> 35:47.872
The same, however, cannot
be said for your friends

35:47.873 --> 35:49.339
and the people of
the French quarter.

35:49.341 --> 35:50.875
Now, I can stand here
and explain to you

35:50.876 --> 35:53.544
the specifics, or you
can show a little trust

35:53.545 --> 35:55.313
and come with me.

35:55.314 --> 35:56.981
I'm the one who's been waiting
for you to move your ass.

35:56.982 --> 35:59.516
Let's go.

36:10.763 --> 36:12.563
Huh...

36:20.572 --> 36:23.207
What you are feeling
is the hunger.

36:23.208 --> 36:30.581
It will be unlike
anything you've ever known.

36:30.582 --> 36:32.717
It is your greatest weapon,
and the Germans

36:32.718 --> 36:34.685
are coming over that hill
thinking to waltz

36:34.686 --> 36:36.787
over our corpses
to take the town,

36:36.788 --> 36:39.156
but that's not gonna happen
because one thing stands

36:39.157 --> 36:43.561
in the enemy's way... us,
and make no mistake.

36:43.562 --> 36:48.232
We are one unit, one army.
We are family.

36:48.233 --> 36:51.202
Family is not determined
by blood,

36:51.203 --> 36:54.805
but by who you fight for
and who will fight for you.

36:57.876 --> 37:01.478
Tonight we will feed
on the blood of our enemies,

37:01.479 --> 37:05.816
and if we die, we will be
reborn, and we will feed again.

37:05.817 --> 37:09.119
We are the brotherhood
of the damned,

37:09.120 --> 37:11.521
and we cannot be defeated!

37:11.523 --> 37:13.356
All: Yeah!

37:13.358 --> 37:14.691
Over the top!

37:14.692 --> 37:16.960
Let's get them!

37:33.877 --> 37:36.946
Huh... aagh!

37:39.082 --> 37:42.318
Rrgh!
Yaagh!

37:46.190 --> 37:48.524
I think we're gonna make it.

38:04.401 --> 38:06.170
Everything is fine out here.

38:06.171 --> 38:07.771
Where the hell are they?

38:07.772 --> 38:09.039
You look around.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.340
I'll see if I can
track them down.

38:38.269 --> 38:40.337
Gia: Welcome back, soldier.

38:40.338 --> 38:42.571
Fed you some of Klaus' blood.

38:42.573 --> 38:46.041
You weren't exactly lucid.

38:57.087 --> 38:59.389
They're all getting
into the rest

38:59.390 --> 39:01.723
of your blood bags downstairs.

39:03.493 --> 39:05.562
But not you.

39:05.563 --> 39:08.097
I'm sorry for being
a pain in the ass.

39:13.269 --> 39:17.106
Only the weak don't
challenge authority, Gia.

39:17.107 --> 39:18.942
You did good.

39:22.573 --> 39:26.316
I applaud you all for your strength
of character.

39:26.317 --> 39:28.051
Just finished congratulating

39:28.052 --> 39:30.085
your little vampire
hoard downstairs.

39:30.087 --> 39:31.620
What did you do to them?

39:31.622 --> 39:33.923
Nothing that isn't reversible.

39:33.924 --> 39:36.592
Came to ask you
a question, Marcel.

39:36.593 --> 39:39.394
See, earlier today I spent
some time with my brothers.

39:39.396 --> 39:41.898
They went to great lengths
to hide something from me,

39:41.899 --> 39:46.102
a secret they'd do
anything to keep.

39:46.103 --> 39:49.437
Now, I may not be able
to get it out of them,

39:49.439 --> 39:52.807
but I'm willing to bet
I could rip it out of you.

39:54.110 --> 39:55.945
Klaus, on phone:
How is my daughter?

39:55.946 --> 39:59.681
She's in good hands, as am I.

39:59.683 --> 40:03.552
However, if you say the word,
I shall return. No.

40:03.553 --> 40:05.721
You're needed where you are.

40:05.722 --> 40:07.490
So the city is safe?

40:07.491 --> 40:08.991
Well, I wouldn't exactly
go flinging around

40:08.992 --> 40:10.860
terms like "safe."

40:10.861 --> 40:14.230
Marcel and all his vampires
have inexplicably disappeared.

40:14.231 --> 40:16.098
Kol is in the wind,
Rebekah is still lost,

40:16.099 --> 40:20.536
and Finn is dangerously suspicious
of the secrets we keep,

40:20.537 --> 40:25.441
speaking of which,
I meant what I said.

40:25.442 --> 40:29.078
I am capable of forgiveness.

40:29.079 --> 40:32.615
We need to remain focused
on our common enemies.

40:32.616 --> 40:35.017
I'll be in touch.

40:36.619 --> 40:40.055
Ah, the cavalry has arrived

40:40.056 --> 40:42.291
and right on time,
no doubt eager

40:42.292 --> 40:44.326
to save your precious Josh.

40:44.327 --> 40:46.962
Yes. Just tell me what you need.

40:46.963 --> 40:49.431
Well, you can start by
questioning your wolves.

40:49.432 --> 40:52.501
Find out what Finn has done
with Marcel and his vampires.

40:52.502 --> 40:54.603
Well, I would, but
most of the wolves

40:54.604 --> 40:56.238
took off for the bayou
waiting for Hayley

40:56.239 --> 40:58.005
and Jackson to finish
their wedding trials.

40:58.007 --> 41:00.409
And what trials might those be?

41:00.410 --> 41:02.311
You know, your basic
old-school werewolf stuff.

41:02.312 --> 41:03.678
They go out into
the woods and smoke

41:03.680 --> 41:05.947
this blue calamus root
out of a peace pipe.

41:05.948 --> 41:10.018
Blue calamus,
a rather specific plant,

41:10.019 --> 41:15.023
known by many for its unique
properties as a truth serum.

41:15.024 --> 41:18.293
In generations past, it
was used among the wolves

41:18.294 --> 41:22.964
for divulgement rituals,
ancient rites

41:22.965 --> 41:27.034
where secrets are confessed.

41:29.738 --> 41:32.374
I don't suppose they
mentioned such a thing.

41:32.375 --> 41:34.075
They just said they had
to do a bunch of rituals

41:34.076 --> 41:35.543
and ceremonial stuff.

41:35.544 --> 41:38.646
And where, exactly,
did Jackson take Hayley?

41:38.647 --> 41:42.517
Aiden: Back country,
deep bayou. Why?

41:42.518 --> 41:45.520
That'll be all.
Stay on point.

41:45.521 --> 41:48.490
Wait. That's it?
Where are you going?

41:48.491 --> 41:52.660
I'm going to have a little chat
with the bride-to-be,

41:52.661 --> 41:59.579
remind her that some secrets
need to stay buried.
