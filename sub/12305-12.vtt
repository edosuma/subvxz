WEBVTT

00:35.938 --> 00:38.023
Hey, Ken, how goes it?

00:38.274 --> 00:39.108
It goes, Wolfe.

00:39.150 --> 00:42.153
It'd be better if I hadn't start my
morning seeing that woman in there.

00:54.665 --> 00:55.458
Alexx?

00:55.583 --> 00:56.542
Hey.

00:58.127 --> 01:00.838
It looks like someone was
thrown through the coffee table.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.006
Yeah.

01:07.094 --> 01:09.889
Looks like there was a wine
glass on the table, huh?

01:10.806 --> 01:14.518
Its stem punctured right
through to her carotid artery.

01:18.564 --> 01:19.523
This amount of blood,

01:19.565 --> 01:22.526
I'd be willing to bet she
died of exsanguination.

01:23.527 --> 01:25.821
So I'm guessing somebody grabbed her,

01:26.322 --> 01:27.490
pushed her.

01:29.909 --> 01:31.869
We might not have a murder weapon.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.540
Hey, Ryan, will you help
me move her over just...?

01:36.582 --> 01:37.792
Alexx, hold on one second.

01:37.833 --> 01:40.294
Just, uh, don't touch her.

01:40.503 --> 01:41.712
Don't put your hands on her.

01:41.754 --> 01:43.506
I'm thinking of trying something.

01:44.882 --> 01:46.592
What are you thinking?

01:48.511 --> 01:50.679
You gonna fume this body

01:51.013 --> 01:52.932
for prints, aren't you?

01:53.057 --> 01:54.100
Right here.

01:54.183 --> 01:54.809
Well, you know,

01:54.850 --> 01:57.520
I could dust the whole room and
get a list of suspects who...

01:57.561 --> 01:59.313
maybe were in here.

01:59.522 --> 02:01.190
But what I need

02:01.524 --> 02:04.026
is a suspect who made
physical contact with her.

02:04.193 --> 02:06.320
Don't give me the hard sell, Wolfe.

02:06.362 --> 02:08.489
Just do what you gotta do
before I whisk her away.

02:08.531 --> 02:09.782
Thank you, Alexx.

03:10.509 --> 03:13.471
Not bad for a makeshift fuming chamber.

03:13.512 --> 03:16.307
I've popped a few tents in my day.

03:24.231 --> 03:25.191
Ryan!

03:25.232 --> 03:26.067
Oh, crap!

03:26.108 --> 03:28.569
I'll go get a fire
extinguisher, all right?

03:31.363 --> 03:34.408
Hurry, Ryan, those glue
fumes are flammable!

03:42.208 --> 03:44.543
Hey, this place is full of ammonia!

03:52.593 --> 03:55.846
We got to get out of here! Let's go!

04:56.500 --> 04:57.960
You two okay?

04:58.418 --> 05:01.463
We're both a little crispy
around the edges, but yeah,

05:02.130 --> 05:03.006
we're all right.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.550
You know, I gotta tell you,
I don't know what happened.

05:04.591 --> 05:06.635
That fuming tent was
fine when I checked it.

05:06.677 --> 05:08.178
Okay,get yourself checked out.

05:08.262 --> 05:09.721
I need you at full strength.

05:09.805 --> 05:13.225
You know, I hate to ask, but what
about the body and the evidence?

05:13.267 --> 05:14.685
The evidence

05:15.602 --> 05:17.354
will never fail us.

05:18.814 --> 05:20.399
This place smells like ammonia.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.192
You know, Ryan and Alexx barely got out.

05:22.234 --> 05:23.610
This could have been ugly.

05:23.735 --> 05:25.320
The scene's all clear.

05:25.487 --> 05:27.656
We got here before there
was too much damage.

05:27.823 --> 05:29.408
Have you got any idea what caused it?

05:29.491 --> 05:31.451
Yeah,it was a fully
operational meth lab.

05:31.493 --> 05:33.036
This place was a ticking time bomb.

05:33.078 --> 05:34.288
Can we get inside?

05:34.329 --> 05:36.498
Sure,we got it under
control. It's all yours now.

05:36.540 --> 05:37.457
Thanks.

05:45.382 --> 05:47.426
There's our fuming tent.

05:48.510 --> 05:50.721
It's melted directly onto her.

05:57.811 --> 05:59.396
Well, there's the lab stuff.

06:10.866 --> 06:13.869
Looks like she took second,
maybe third-degree burns.

06:14.578 --> 06:16.121
So much for trace.

06:17.623 --> 06:18.415
I don't know.

06:18.457 --> 06:19.625
She was partially protected.

06:19.708 --> 06:22.502
It doesn't look like the open
flames breached her backside.

06:23.086 --> 06:24.755
Think we still may have a chance?

06:25.130 --> 06:26.798
Until we try.

06:32.596 --> 06:34.306
If she was a meth cook,

06:34.431 --> 06:36.516
I'm not sure I have a
whole lot of sympathy.

06:37.142 --> 06:39.978
I don't think we know
what she is at this point.

06:40.604 --> 06:41.730
You got something else?

06:41.980 --> 06:45.275
Yeah, Ryan's fuming tent
didn't start this fire.

06:46.568 --> 06:47.986
What do you think it was?

06:49.321 --> 06:51.114
Well, look at the char
on the wall socket.

06:51.156 --> 06:52.324
It's cooked.

06:53.325 --> 06:55.244
I think that's why the fan shorted out.

06:55.619 --> 06:56.578
I'll call Delko.

06:56.620 --> 06:57.913
Get him on it.

07:09.091 --> 07:11.260
The circuit breakers are all taped open.

07:12.553 --> 07:14.471
So when the power overloaded,
the breakers couldn't throw.

07:14.513 --> 07:16.515
The electrical couldn't turn itself off.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.903
I wonder if this is some
sort of an insurance scam.

07:30.279 --> 07:33.365
Owner knew he had bad tenants, wanted
to kill two birds with one stone?

07:33.407 --> 07:34.533
Possibly.

07:35.951 --> 07:37.911
All right, let's see
who get's paid and I'll

07:38.120 --> 07:39.371
call H.

07:47.421 --> 07:49.464
So you're the one who torched my condo?

07:49.506 --> 07:51.717
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Broyles,

07:51.758 --> 07:53.927
but it was actually nothing like that.

07:54.636 --> 07:56.179
Tell it to my attorney.

07:56.221 --> 07:59.933
The girl that we found in the
torched condo's name is Rachel

08:00.309 --> 08:02.561
Hemming, Mr. Broyles.

08:03.729 --> 08:05.439
My God, it was her.

08:06.607 --> 08:07.900
I can't believe it.

08:08.483 --> 08:09.860
So she lived in your rental?

08:09.902 --> 08:11.486
Yeah, she was a model tenant.

08:11.570 --> 08:13.989
And living in a converted meth lab.

08:14.156 --> 08:17.701
Did you give her a break on
the rent or just stiff-arm her?

08:19.286 --> 08:21.622
Found a lot of glassware in there.

08:21.663 --> 08:23.749
Enough to make a pound a week.

08:23.957 --> 08:25.167
That's a,

08:25.834 --> 08:27.419
that's pretty big business.

08:27.669 --> 08:30.339
You overloaded the circuit
breaker to make your drugs,

08:30.380 --> 08:32.506
and she was collateral damage.

08:36.720 --> 08:40.474
Did you tamper with the electrical
system to deal with the power

08:40.640 --> 08:41.600
overload?

08:41.642 --> 08:43.559
I don't know what to tell you guys.

08:44.311 --> 08:47.814
The girl paid her rent on time,
so I respected her privacy.

08:47.856 --> 08:51.485
What, you gonna bust me
for not being more nosy?

08:51.526 --> 08:54.529
Actually,it's called
"criminal homicide. "

08:55.364 --> 08:57.157
Counting one,

08:57.741 --> 08:59.952
two, three

09:00.452 --> 09:02.788
drug-related priors here.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.248
That was her apartment.

09:04.331 --> 09:06.041
Those days are behind me.

09:06.708 --> 09:08.001
Apparent not.

09:12.589 --> 09:14.466
Oh,no-no-no-no-no.

09:14.508 --> 09:16.885
Turn right back around,honey.

09:16.927 --> 09:18.178
You gonna have to give me more time.

09:18.220 --> 09:21.014
I mean,I haven't even had
a chance to examine her.

09:21.056 --> 09:24.226
That's perfect 'cause I wanted
to catch you before you started.

09:24.476 --> 09:25.769
Okay, what's up?

09:25.811 --> 09:28.397
I usually don't see you
guys down here with a kit.

09:28.438 --> 09:31.400
I wanted to see if the fuming tent had
a chance to do its job before it went up.

09:31.525 --> 09:32.526
Well,

09:33.235 --> 09:35.946
there wasn't a whole lot
the fire didn't touch.

09:36.071 --> 09:39.741
Maybe a patch of skin that
came in contact with the floor.

09:39.908 --> 09:41.493
All right, we'll start there.

09:41.618 --> 09:43.412
Let me move her, all right?

09:47.541 --> 09:48.417
You got it?

09:48.625 --> 09:49.376
Got it.

09:55.465 --> 09:57.467
Back this end up just a little bit.

09:57.634 --> 09:58.635
Okay.

10:01.763 --> 10:03.557
We got a partial print.

10:03.807 --> 10:04.641
Really?

10:05.183 --> 10:07.185
Looks like the fumes
did their job after all.

10:07.227 --> 10:08.186
Cool.

10:15.736 --> 10:16.528
Okay.

10:18.780 --> 10:19.740
Hey,

10:20.616 --> 10:23.076
Eric, what do you think that is?

10:24.077 --> 10:25.871
That looks like a piece of plastic.

10:26.622 --> 10:28.373
Think it's part of her clothing?

10:28.957 --> 10:30.542
Looks like she wore it
underneath her clothing,

10:30.584 --> 10:33.712
and whatever it was,the
fire melted it into her skin.

10:37.758 --> 10:40.219
I have no idea what this is.

10:40.260 --> 10:43.222
You guys are gonna have
to figure this one out.

10:43.347 --> 10:46.850
Well, it's hidden in the last
place that someone would look.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.810
If you ask me, I think it's a wire.

10:48.852 --> 10:50.145
A wire?

10:51.813 --> 10:54.650
So why was our baby girl bugged?

10:54.858 --> 10:57.236
Maybe whoever left that print knows.

11:00.906 --> 11:01.740
No!

11:09.540 --> 11:11.833
I rushed in soon as
I got the phone call.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.418
I'm not from the area.

11:13.502 --> 11:14.878
Rachel's my sister.

11:15.045 --> 11:17.047
What, you need me to
sign for her or something?

11:17.089 --> 11:18.298
Post bail?

11:18.757 --> 11:19.967
What'd she do this time?

11:20.092 --> 11:22.261
Well,I was hoping
that you could tell me.

11:22.844 --> 11:25.055
Your sister was killed this morning.

11:26.390 --> 11:27.558
Are you sure?

11:27.933 --> 11:28.725
Yeah.

11:33.105 --> 11:35.107
I can't believe this is happening.

11:35.190 --> 11:36.608
What am I gonna tell our parents?

11:36.775 --> 11:38.318
Well, how about the truth?

11:39.820 --> 11:41.321
That's what I'm looking for.

11:43.115 --> 11:45.617
Zach, we found your
print on Rachel's body.

11:47.035 --> 11:48.704
I'd never hurt her.

11:49.079 --> 11:50.914
We have you in our system for assault.

11:50.956 --> 11:53.083
Yeah, but that was for
stupid college stuff.

11:53.125 --> 11:54.668
The two of you have a fight?

11:59.131 --> 12:01.258
Not a "fight" fight. It wasn't...

12:02.718 --> 12:05.554
Look, Rachel hasn't had an easy life.

12:07.139 --> 12:09.099
She got in with the wrong crowd.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.270
Our parents got her into rehab.

12:16.148 --> 12:17.441
She ran away?

12:18.734 --> 12:19.443
Yeah.

12:21.194 --> 12:22.362
Three months ago.

12:23.614 --> 12:25.449
I came down from Ohio.

12:25.616 --> 12:27.201
I finally found her

12:27.326 --> 12:28.952
and I tried to get her to come home.

12:29.745 --> 12:31.747
- Rachel.
- Zach, what are you doing here?

12:31.788 --> 12:33.248
I'm not leaving without you.

12:33.290 --> 12:35.500
No, just leave.

12:35.876 --> 12:37.127
You're coming with me.

12:38.462 --> 12:39.546
No!

12:42.883 --> 12:44.259
Is that how she fell?

12:44.301 --> 12:45.510
She didn't fall.

12:46.053 --> 12:47.596
She's tougher than that.

12:49.223 --> 12:50.474
She slapped me.

12:50.974 --> 12:52.726
Told me to get lost and...

12:53.393 --> 12:54.353
that's what I did.

12:54.478 --> 12:55.979
So you're saying

12:56.146 --> 12:58.065
that you came all the
way down here from Ohio

12:58.148 --> 13:01.360
to bring our sister back, she
told you to leave and you left?

13:01.944 --> 13:03.195
What else could I do?

13:03.487 --> 13:05.489
Well, I think we both know what.

13:05.989 --> 13:07.950
Look, you're looking
at the wrong guy here.

13:08.033 --> 13:10.327
I didn't come to Miami to kill anyone.

13:10.369 --> 13:11.370
If you did,

13:11.870 --> 13:13.205
you'll never leaving.

13:41.977 --> 13:43.520
Hey, what you got?

13:44.020 --> 13:47.190
Well, there's nothing on the wine
glass that punctured her neck, but...

13:47.315 --> 13:50.610
that piece of metal Alexx found
on Rachel Hemming's body...

13:51.111 --> 13:52.821
It's a recording device.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.197
Really?

13:54.781 --> 13:56.283
Well, maybe if the memory
card's still intact,

13:56.324 --> 13:57.701
we could hear who killed her.

13:57.742 --> 14:00.328
Yeah,dream on. It's just a transmitter.

14:00.412 --> 14:01.204
Now

14:01.580 --> 14:03.623
we'll be stuck trying to
figure out who it transmits to.

14:03.665 --> 14:05.375
And it's a pretty tall order.

14:05.417 --> 14:06.751
Always is.

14:06.918 --> 14:07.627
But...

14:08.587 --> 14:11.840
think I got some kind of serial
number here on the power source.

14:12.382 --> 14:14.217
Let's take a closer look.

14:19.764 --> 14:20.849
Group Three.

14:20.890 --> 14:22.309
MFO.

14:23.059 --> 14:25.437
Well, MFO stands for Miami Field Office.

14:25.478 --> 14:26.980
Miami's got the most field offices of

14:27.022 --> 14:29.733
any law enforcement
agency in the country.

14:30.275 --> 14:33.236
Trying to find the right one,you
want to talk about a tall order?

14:33.653 --> 14:34.529
Let's see.

14:34.946 --> 14:36.323
That's the number.

14:36.406 --> 14:38.909
I'm gonna put it in the
database, see if we get lucky.

14:39.951 --> 14:41.494
I don't think you have to.

14:41.578 --> 14:43.538
I actually know this office code.

14:43.622 --> 14:44.706
How's that?

14:45.040 --> 14:46.499
I used to work there.

15:01.598 --> 15:03.516
- Lieutenant, Mike Farallon.
- Mike

15:03.975 --> 15:05.143
- Natalia.
- Hey.

15:05.185 --> 15:08.271
Have to admit it's strange
having you back in these offices.

15:08.313 --> 15:09.189
I know.

15:09.522 --> 15:11.316
- She was one of the best.
- Thanks.

15:11.358 --> 15:12.484
I agree.

15:12.901 --> 15:14.527
Why don't we go somewhere
a little more private?

15:19.658 --> 15:20.825
So how can I help you?

15:21.534 --> 15:24.329
Mike,we're here to talk
about Rachel Hemming.

15:27.290 --> 15:28.667
We spoke to your ASAC.

15:29.084 --> 15:32.295
And we know that she was your
confidential informant, Mike.

15:33.588 --> 15:35.215
She was, yes.

15:36.007 --> 15:37.008
I just heard.

15:37.801 --> 15:39.177
It's a big loss for us.

15:39.219 --> 15:40.512
She was your find?

15:41.179 --> 15:42.514
Yeah, about three months ago

15:42.555 --> 15:45.517
I picked her up for possession
with intent to distribute.

15:45.558 --> 15:48.770
I could tell she wasn't a user,
so instead of locking her up,

15:48.895 --> 15:52.023
I put her inside a meth
operation we were tracking.

15:52.774 --> 15:54.734
30 grams, Rachel.

15:54.901 --> 15:57.946
That's a felony possession
with intent to distribute.

15:58.238 --> 16:01.116
You're looking at seven years
in a federal penitentiary.

16:01.283 --> 16:02.826
You said you could get me out of it.

16:02.867 --> 16:04.035
That's right.

16:04.452 --> 16:06.997
I can make this whole thing
disappear into the ether.

16:07.163 --> 16:08.582
What do I have to do?

16:09.249 --> 16:10.542
Keep dealing.

16:12.794 --> 16:16.131
Rachel's intel was taking us directly
to the operation's leadership.

16:16.172 --> 16:17.591
What do you think happened to her?

16:17.674 --> 16:21.219
I was supposed to meet her at a
warehouse downtown to get a report,but...

16:21.261 --> 16:22.596
she never showed.

16:22.846 --> 16:24.180
What about the surveillance audio?

16:24.264 --> 16:25.307
She was wired.

16:25.557 --> 16:27.434
It's the first thing I checked.

16:27.601 --> 16:29.436
Unfortunately, the bug
wasn't transmitting.

16:29.477 --> 16:31.187
Why do you think that happened?

16:33.982 --> 16:36.026
I'm sorry, this is as far as I can go.

16:36.651 --> 16:38.778
This is still an open investigation.

16:39.195 --> 16:41.031
So is her murder, Mike.

16:41.823 --> 16:43.325
So is her murder.

16:48.496 --> 16:49.915
So, Ryan

16:49.998 --> 16:53.418
torches this condo and he's not
here helping us sift through this

16:53.501 --> 16:54.794
because...

16:54.836 --> 16:57.464
Oh, come on, Eric,
that wasn't his fault.

16:57.839 --> 17:01.509
Yeah, well, it would've been nice of
him to at least offer a little help.

17:01.927 --> 17:03.511
Calleigh, you needed to see me?

17:03.720 --> 17:07.348
Yes. I was wondering if you would
take those four cans of glass

17:07.432 --> 17:10.560
that we got from the crime
scene and run them through DNA.

17:10.602 --> 17:11.810
Every piece?

17:11.853 --> 17:12.604
Yeah.

17:12.938 --> 17:15.022
Yeah, we're gonna need it ASAP, okay?

17:15.106 --> 17:18.068
Sure, and while I'm at it, I'll
find a way to end global warming

17:18.151 --> 17:21.195
and finish that proof of the unified
field theory I've been working on.

17:21.363 --> 17:23.281
Would it be inappropriate
if I asked you right now

17:23.323 --> 17:25.617
if it was going to take
you more than an hour?

17:27.077 --> 17:29.496
I know I'm a miracle worker, but

17:29.537 --> 17:31.873
there is a lot of work
to be miracled here.

17:31.998 --> 17:34.125
But I will get on it.

17:34.918 --> 17:38.129
I'll send someone over to collect the
rest of the stuff as you go through it.

17:38.171 --> 17:40.006
Thank you, Maxine.

17:41.174 --> 17:43.051
All right, what have you got next?

17:43.802 --> 17:45.220
A picture of Rachel Hemming.

17:45.262 --> 17:47.055
But I don't know who the guy is.

17:48.306 --> 17:50.517
I don't know. They
look awfully friendly.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.352
Boyfriend, ex-boyfriend, maybe.

17:52.394 --> 17:55.188
Whoever it is,I'm sure it's
someone we're gonna want to talk to.

17:55.272 --> 17:58.567
Well, if you do that,you're gonna have
to pull his mug out of all that damage.

18:00.235 --> 18:02.279
Check it out, there's
some writing on the back.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.531
Can't make it out.

18:04.948 --> 18:08.076
Well, maybe Ryan will
make himself useful in QD.

18:09.786 --> 18:12.747
Well, I will deliver
it to him personally.

18:18.962 --> 18:20.130
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:20.171 --> 18:23.174
Just came in to get a peek at the
picture that Calleigh keeps talking about.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.803
Yeah, I uploaded a digital version
into the image editor software

18:26.845 --> 18:29.598
to recover what damage was done.

18:30.265 --> 18:32.058
Does it one pixel at a time.

18:32.100 --> 18:34.644
Thousands of color
combinations per second.

18:34.686 --> 18:38.398
Get an accurate representation
of basically what we lost.

18:42.986 --> 18:44.571
I know who that is.

18:45.989 --> 18:47.449
- Who?
- Mike.

18:47.490 --> 18:50.285
- Who's Mike?
- Mike Farallon. FBI.

18:50.619 --> 18:51.494
Really?

18:53.246 --> 18:54.623
Well, you're gonna love this.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.336
You know, the handwriting that
was on the back of the photo?

18:59.377 --> 19:00.879
Well, the ink's pigment was gone.

19:01.588 --> 19:03.590
But the solvent was still on the paper.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.675
Could you get any of the words to pop?

19:06.301 --> 19:09.554
After 380 nanometers
of ultraviolet light...

19:09.888 --> 19:10.722
you bet.

19:15.352 --> 19:17.687
"Stay away or you'll get hurt. "

19:19.147 --> 19:20.899
Well, that picture just became a threat.

19:20.941 --> 19:23.526
Yeah, it looks like somebody's
still playing the old jealousy card.

19:23.652 --> 19:25.237
Yeah, well, at least
I know where to start.

19:25.278 --> 19:26.988
Mike, the FBI guy, right?

19:27.030 --> 19:28.156
No.

19:29.032 --> 19:30.200
His wife.

19:31.618 --> 19:33.787
Is that your writing, Mrs. Farallon?

19:35.622 --> 19:36.456
No.

19:37.999 --> 19:40.210
We'll need a handwriting
sample to confirm that.

19:41.211 --> 19:42.504
What's this about?

19:47.968 --> 19:49.094
My husband.

19:50.178 --> 19:52.514
Do you recognize the woman
that's in the picture with him?

19:53.890 --> 19:55.725
I've never seen her before.

19:55.976 --> 19:58.728
Her name's Rachel Hemming and
she was murdered this morning.

19:58.895 --> 20:00.480
What, you suspect Mike?

20:00.855 --> 20:03.191
We're investigating all the angles.

20:06.444 --> 20:07.862
Mike and I married young.

20:08.780 --> 20:10.115
We made, uh...

20:10.657 --> 20:11.908
adjustments.

20:12.492 --> 20:13.702
Mike's an undercover agent.

20:13.743 --> 20:16.037
He's forced to live in two worlds, so...

20:16.454 --> 20:17.872
we have an understanding.

20:19.207 --> 20:20.542
And what is that?

20:20.667 --> 20:23.461
What he does when he's out
of the house is his business.

20:24.504 --> 20:26.089
He keeps a roof over our heads,

20:26.172 --> 20:28.008
our kids go to good schools,

20:28.174 --> 20:30.343
and, uh, when he comes home...

20:30.719 --> 20:32.012
he belongs to me.

20:33.847 --> 20:35.640
You make that sound so simple.

20:37.225 --> 20:38.643
It's anything but.

20:42.230 --> 20:44.816
Can you account for your
whereabouts in the last 24 hours?

20:47.402 --> 20:49.279
I was home with my family.

20:49.321 --> 20:50.614
And you can prove that?

20:52.282 --> 20:53.909
Check it out for yourself.

20:57.787 --> 20:59.331
Thanks for coming in.

21:05.337 --> 21:07.505
She has an alibi, so I'm
gonna go check it out.

21:08.340 --> 21:10.759
There's something wrong, Ms. Boa Vista.

21:11.134 --> 21:15.430
Well,evidently, the Farallons have a
marriage of convenience and she just...

21:15.513 --> 21:16.890
tolerates the infidelity.

21:16.932 --> 21:18.808
So he has a history.

21:20.894 --> 21:24.231
Three years ago when I was
working with Mike at the bureau,

21:24.439 --> 21:26.524
I found out that he was
sleeping with an informant

21:26.858 --> 21:28.235
and I confronted him.

21:29.277 --> 21:31.363
And he asked me to keep it quiet.

21:31.529 --> 21:32.822
And what did you do?

21:34.783 --> 21:35.742
I did.

21:39.371 --> 21:41.748
Now I wish I'd had the
guts to tell the bureau.

21:41.790 --> 21:44.709
Are you willing to do that now?

21:45.543 --> 21:46.795
Yeah, I am.

21:46.836 --> 21:49.422
The original informant,are
we in touch with her?

21:49.464 --> 21:50.840
can be.

21:50.882 --> 21:52.300
Bring her in.

22:03.246 --> 22:05.081
You've seen awhile.

22:05.665 --> 22:07.167
- How you been?
- Good.

22:07.208 --> 22:10.628
You know I didn't bring you in here
to chat about the lat few years, right?

22:12.630 --> 22:15.967
So, I'm guessing this is about Mikey.

22:16.426 --> 22:17.177
Yeah.

22:18.344 --> 22:19.804
Agent Farallon.

22:21.181 --> 22:22.807
Did you know he had a new C.I.?

22:23.266 --> 22:24.184
Hell, yeah.

22:24.809 --> 22:28.271
Told me he needed a fresh face
to stay ahead of the bad guys.

22:28.313 --> 22:33.651
So he cut me loose, and brought in
this cute little number to replace me.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.238
I'm guessing that bothered you.

22:38.823 --> 22:40.950
Mikey and I spent a
lot of time together.

22:41.910 --> 22:44.329
I was his eyes and ears.

22:46.164 --> 22:48.625
I made nice with some of...

22:50.877 --> 22:54.005
the craziest meth
dealers in Miami-

22:55.089 --> 22:56.257
All for him.

22:57.884 --> 22:59.761
I did everything he asked me to do.

23:00.053 --> 23:01.221
I know you did.

23:01.679 --> 23:02.764
Everything.

23:04.682 --> 23:08.436
The more I risked my life for him,
the more he had to rush in to save me.

23:10.939 --> 23:13.191
I thought he and I had something.

23:14.817 --> 23:17.111
So you paid a little
visit to Rachel Hemming?

23:18.947 --> 23:19.781
Yeah.

23:21.407 --> 23:22.325
I did.

23:25.411 --> 23:27.997
I wanted her to know that
she was only temporary.

23:39.384 --> 23:41.719
Mikey doesn't care about you.

23:41.970 --> 23:43.304
What? Who are you?

23:44.556 --> 23:47.433
I'm your mirror to the past.

23:48.017 --> 23:50.103
Three months ago, I was you.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.021
It's not like that at all.

23:52.313 --> 23:53.147
Really?

23:56.526 --> 23:58.027
Are you sure about that?

23:58.695 --> 23:59.821
It's a copy

23:59.946 --> 24:00.822
for you.

24:01.322 --> 24:03.158
The original's for his wife.

24:03.616 --> 24:05.410
Why are you doing this to me?

24:05.535 --> 24:06.911
It's for your own good.

24:12.792 --> 24:13.877
Mikey...

24:14.711 --> 24:16.546
is a piece of work.

24:18.548 --> 24:21.092
I bet he gave her the same, um...

24:21.342 --> 24:23.469
safe word that he gave me.

24:26.222 --> 24:27.348
"Together. "

24:29.601 --> 24:32.187
And what is that-what's
"together", what does it mean?

24:32.228 --> 24:33.688
For when you're in danger.

24:34.147 --> 24:36.232
You say the word, and then

24:36.524 --> 24:38.151
Agent Mike

24:38.359 --> 24:41.446
can burst in and save the day.

24:42.530 --> 24:45.241
Like in one of those romance novels.

24:48.328 --> 24:51.664
I cannot believe that I fell for that.

24:54.334 --> 24:55.418
Can I go?

24:57.462 --> 24:59.255
You had physical contact
with a murder victim,

24:59.297 --> 25:02.258
so until we figure out how
this whole story's going to end,

25:02.425 --> 25:04.177
I need you to stay close.

25:05.512 --> 25:06.554
All right.

25:10.934 --> 25:12.560
You talked to Jane?

25:13.645 --> 25:17.023
She's obsessed. How could you
give what she says any credence?

25:17.232 --> 25:18.483
That's the thing about a C.I.,

25:18.525 --> 25:21.194
you have to believe what
they say or they're useless.

25:21.236 --> 25:23.321
Then we confirm with hard data.

25:24.072 --> 25:26.533
I was not sleeping with Rachel Hemming.

25:26.574 --> 25:28.117
I'm married, B.V.

25:31.996 --> 25:34.332
You know, there's a real
problem when the informant

25:34.415 --> 25:36.584
is more reliable than you are.

25:43.466 --> 25:45.343
How deep did you get with Rachel?

25:47.136 --> 25:48.179
Depends who you ask.

25:48.221 --> 25:50.515
She's dead, and you're
the only one left.

25:50.557 --> 25:51.516
What are you implying?

25:51.558 --> 25:52.892
Just what everybody
else is thinking, Mike,

25:52.934 --> 25:55.395
that she had more of your
secrets than anyone else's.

25:55.436 --> 25:57.105
You know me, Natalia.

25:57.772 --> 25:59.774
Rachel was too critical
to our objective.

25:59.816 --> 26:02.068
You know, work has always come first.

26:04.654 --> 26:06.531
I really hope that's true, Mike.

26:07.115 --> 26:09.826
'Cause, you know, you're
running out of time and excuses.

26:25.425 --> 26:27.719
Hey... Alexx, what are you doing up here?

26:27.760 --> 26:29.762
I'm afraid it's not good news.

26:29.804 --> 26:30.555
What is it?

26:31.973 --> 26:34.767
I found more than glass
in Rachel Hemming's body.

26:34.809 --> 26:36.269
There was a fetus.

26:37.020 --> 26:38.354
She was pregnant.

26:38.438 --> 26:40.773
Yeah, about ten to 12 weeks along.

26:40.857 --> 26:41.941
Who's the father?

26:41.983 --> 26:44.527
DNA's working on it right now.

26:45.612 --> 26:47.197
One death just became two.

26:48.156 --> 26:50.116
Catch this monster, Calleigh.

26:50.825 --> 26:52.452
Catch this one.

26:59.918 --> 27:02.921
Hey, is Valera still working on that
glass from the Rachel Hemming's case?

27:02.962 --> 27:04.297
Yeah, but she's pretty swamped.

27:04.339 --> 27:06.132
So I thought I'd jump
in and lend a hand.

27:06.174 --> 27:08.009
Okay, 'cause I just ran
into Alexx in the hall.

27:08.051 --> 27:09.719
She told me Rachel was pregnant.

27:09.969 --> 27:11.596
Did she bring you the foetal tissue?

27:12.180 --> 27:12.764
Yeah.

27:13.681 --> 27:17.185
I'm running that sample for a
familial match right now through CODIS.

27:18.436 --> 27:21.981
And then I'm going to compare
it to Mike Farallon's file.

27:27.153 --> 27:30.698
His track record with his confidential
informants is questionable...

27:30.907 --> 27:31.825
at best.

27:33.618 --> 27:35.995
I'm just hoping that he
didn't make another mistake.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.539
For his sake.

27:41.501 --> 27:43.294
Look at that, it's not Mike.

27:45.296 --> 27:47.715
But it does match another
elimination sample.

27:49.092 --> 27:50.260
Zach Hemming.

27:50.802 --> 27:51.845
Her brother?

27:56.349 --> 27:57.058
Zach,

27:57.642 --> 28:00.019
why was Rachel pregnant with your baby?

28:00.061 --> 28:01.354
She's your sister.

28:01.521 --> 28:02.522
Stepsister.

28:03.398 --> 28:04.649
By marriage only.

28:04.858 --> 28:06.442
Her father, my mom

28:07.277 --> 28:08.528
we weren't related.

28:08.778 --> 28:10.280
But you have the same name.

28:10.572 --> 28:11.656
No, we don't.

28:11.698 --> 28:13.241
Rachel's last name is Desmond.

28:13.366 --> 28:15.869
When she came to Miami, she used
my father's name to hide out.

28:16.244 --> 28:18.121
And that's what you
used to track her down?

28:18.746 --> 28:19.330
Yeah.

28:21.332 --> 28:22.125
Look,

28:22.250 --> 28:24.460
we were 18 when our parents got married.

28:25.128 --> 28:26.880
We lived in the same house

28:27.630 --> 28:28.882
a room apart.

28:28.965 --> 28:30.175
Things just...

28:30.967 --> 28:32.343
sort of happened.

28:34.554 --> 28:37.265
We tried to cut things off,
but then she got pregnant.

28:38.224 --> 28:40.226
And you agreed to keep the baby?

28:40.476 --> 28:41.769
She was afraid of...

28:42.187 --> 28:43.646
what our parents might think,

28:43.730 --> 28:45.231
so that's why she left.

28:47.483 --> 28:49.861
I went after her so she
didn't have to face it alone.

28:50.612 --> 28:52.822
You can't live like this, Rachel.

28:53.072 --> 28:55.241
You can't raise a kid like this.

28:55.617 --> 28:57.410
I have someone else, Zach.

28:57.452 --> 29:00.288
Someone to take care of me and the baby.

29:00.663 --> 29:01.956
Just go.

29:02.248 --> 29:04.209
Go home, Zach!

29:08.588 --> 29:10.882
It took me three months to find her.

29:11.341 --> 29:12.842
I was so frustrated.

29:13.301 --> 29:15.011
She left me powerless.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.513
How frustrating?

29:17.388 --> 29:18.515
Did you kill her?

29:18.556 --> 29:20.433
I know I don't have enough
money to support a family,

29:20.475 --> 29:22.602
but it would have been better
than the life she was living.

29:22.685 --> 29:24.354
I saw the drugs.

29:24.812 --> 29:26.272
She needed help.

29:27.065 --> 29:30.860
- Zach...
- No, I didn't... I didn't hurt her.

29:31.361 --> 29:33.488
Even if I couldn't be
part of their life...

29:34.364 --> 29:37.033
I would never hurt her.

29:45.458 --> 29:46.918
Lieutenant Caine?

29:52.715 --> 29:53.758
You have a moment?

29:54.425 --> 29:56.135
Of course I do, Glen.

29:56.845 --> 29:58.847
You questioned one of my agents today.

29:58.888 --> 29:59.973
Mike Farallon.

30:00.014 --> 30:03.309
We're investigating the murder
of one of your informants.

30:03.351 --> 30:06.646
I'd like to ask you to
back off of Agent Farallon.

30:08.189 --> 30:09.649
He's hiding something.

30:09.858 --> 30:11.568
That's his job, Lieutenant.

30:11.776 --> 30:14.195
We were four hours from a
major drug bust this morning.

30:14.237 --> 30:16.990
Till Rachel Hemming's
murder got in the way.

30:17.073 --> 30:18.074
Agent Farallon,

30:18.533 --> 30:21.119
the Bureau, is hanging
but a thread on this one.

30:21.161 --> 30:23.079
We cannot afford to overreact.

30:23.121 --> 30:26.791
Was he recording surveillance
at the time of her death, Glen?

30:27.375 --> 30:28.668
I have no idea what you're getting at,

30:28.710 --> 30:30.920
but whether he was or not, I
have no reason to doubt him.

30:30.962 --> 30:33.464
Are you aware they
were having an affair?

30:34.924 --> 30:37.927
The Bureau is willing to forgive
any of Farallon's transgressions

30:37.969 --> 30:41.848
if it means bringing down the largest
organized meth operation in South Florida.

30:41.890 --> 30:45.226
I'm going to need the
name of her target.

30:45.268 --> 30:46.519
No chance, Lieutenant.

30:46.561 --> 30:48.396
You'll know who he is
when we make the arrest.

30:48.438 --> 30:50.899
And as for Agent Farallon...

30:51.107 --> 30:53.902
I need you to back off
until we make those arrests.

30:53.943 --> 30:55.236
Hey, Glen...

30:56.946 --> 31:00.783
If I find out that he
got this girl killed,

31:00.909 --> 31:02.577
I'm going to get him.

31:12.071 --> 31:15.325
So, how is it going with the
glass from the crime scene?

31:16.576 --> 31:18.703
Let me guess- they
all match the victim.

31:18.828 --> 31:21.164
Yeah. Rachel Hemming
lost a lot of blood.

31:21.497 --> 31:23.166
Needle in a haystack.

31:23.666 --> 31:27.086
These are all victim's, victim...

31:29.797 --> 31:31.174
This one's XY.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.884
That's male. That's not our victim.

31:32.967 --> 31:35.011
Guess there was a needle after all.

31:36.137 --> 31:38.640
Let me run it against
our reference samples.

31:42.060 --> 31:43.853
Jeremy Broyles?

31:44.854 --> 31:46.564
That's Rachel's landlord.

31:47.523 --> 31:51.694
H, listen, I think you're gonna
want to revisit one of our suspects.

32:05.792 --> 32:07.377
Broyles owns the whole building.

32:07.418 --> 32:10.046
- I've got all entrances and exits blocked off.
- Okay.

32:10.088 --> 32:11.506
Lieutenant, over here.

32:13.800 --> 32:14.926
Bingo, Frank.

32:16.094 --> 32:17.053
Here we go.

32:21.432 --> 32:22.392
You smell that, Frank?

32:22.559 --> 32:24.018
Yeah. Meth lab.

32:25.603 --> 32:27.480
Miami-Dade PD!

32:28.731 --> 32:30.567
- Can I help you?
- Is your landlord here?

32:30.692 --> 32:31.526
No, sorry...

32:39.158 --> 32:40.118
Jeremy!

32:41.703 --> 32:43.288
You've got the wrong guy.

32:43.329 --> 32:44.872
Get down on the ground, Jeremy.

32:44.914 --> 32:46.124
You've got the wrong guy,man.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.376
Jeremy, get down on the ground.

32:49.669 --> 32:50.962
You got the wrong guy,man.

32:51.004 --> 32:53.840
We found your blood in
Rachel Hemming's apartment.

32:53.881 --> 32:54.841
I'm the landlord.

32:54.882 --> 32:57.218
I'm in these units all
the time making repairs.

32:57.302 --> 32:58.803
You're under arrest for murder.

32:59.220 --> 33:00.096
Hook him up.

33:20.658 --> 33:21.242
H.

33:23.828 --> 33:25.079
I got something.

33:27.290 --> 33:28.333
A piece of glass.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.877
Conchoidial fracture, bevel surface.

33:31.711 --> 33:33.963
Same as the victim's coffee table.

33:34.088 --> 33:35.506
I don't know how that got there.

33:35.548 --> 33:36.841
Have a seat here, please.

33:40.011 --> 33:42.847
So we got you at the crime scene. Right?

33:43.765 --> 33:46.267
We have the crime scene on you.

33:48.102 --> 33:50.188
I don't think things
could be any more clear.

33:50.438 --> 33:52.690
Let me clarify something else for you.

33:53.733 --> 33:55.485
That bitch deserved what she got.

33:57.987 --> 33:59.614
In my business...

33:59.864 --> 34:01.157
loyalty

34:01.491 --> 34:02.784
is everything.

34:03.493 --> 34:05.411
Something seemed off about her.

34:05.495 --> 34:06.329
Then it hit me.

34:06.371 --> 34:08.331
She never, not once,

34:08.623 --> 34:10.041
tested our product.

34:10.792 --> 34:12.001
Somebody got to you.

34:12.502 --> 34:13.127
What?

34:14.045 --> 34:14.629
A cop?

34:16.922 --> 34:18.466
We're together on this.

34:18.841 --> 34:19.801
You hear me?

34:20.301 --> 34:21.177
Together.

34:22.844 --> 34:23.596
Okay.

34:24.806 --> 34:26.056
Then we share this.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.478
Come on, Jeremy, not today.

34:32.813 --> 34:34.023
Why not, baby?

34:36.234 --> 34:37.777
Why won't you take a hit?

34:39.152 --> 34:41.739
We've got that deal later. I
just want to keep a clear head.

34:42.991 --> 34:45.368
- You're lying to me, baby.
- No.

34:45.409 --> 34:49.246
- Yes, you are. You're a narc, aren't you?
- No! You don't understand!

34:49.289 --> 34:50.956
No! Don't!

35:13.396 --> 35:15.565
Didn't anybody ever teach
her the rules of the game?

35:15.815 --> 35:16.816
Blend in.

35:17.817 --> 35:19.235
She takes the hit...

35:20.361 --> 35:21.946
she lives to see another day.

35:23.865 --> 35:25.491
You know what was off about her?

35:25.950 --> 35:26.576
What?

35:27.535 --> 35:28.870
She was pregnant.

35:31.497 --> 35:36.127
So not only,Jeremy, did
you kill a new mother...

35:36.836 --> 35:38.963
you killed her unborn child.

35:39.839 --> 35:40.965
Live with that.

35:53.561 --> 35:54.896
Oh, Miss Boa Vista.

35:55.772 --> 35:58.524
I understand you closed
the Rachel Hemming case.

35:58.566 --> 36:01.236
We did. We arrested Jeremy
Broyles for her murder.

36:02.028 --> 36:05.365
Why? Are you here to tell us that
we screwed up your investigation?

36:05.949 --> 36:06.532
Hardly.

36:06.950 --> 36:09.452
Turns out you guys chopped
off the head of the snake.

36:09.494 --> 36:11.955
We got panicked meth dealers
looking for new product.

36:12.580 --> 36:13.665
Fish in a barrel.

36:13.706 --> 36:15.166
That's great. Is that for us?

36:15.458 --> 36:16.084
Oh, yeah.

36:16.125 --> 36:19.254
I pulled all the audio files
off Agent Farallon's computer.

36:19.295 --> 36:20.546
Anything of interest?

36:20.672 --> 36:22.298
I haven't had a chance to hear it, but

36:22.715 --> 36:25.677
now that you got Broyles for murder,
it's probably a moot point anyway.

36:27.095 --> 36:27.845
Maybe not.

36:29.305 --> 36:30.014
What do you mean?

36:30.056 --> 36:30.723
Want to come with me?

36:31.057 --> 36:31.641
Sure.

36:36.271 --> 36:38.690
So this is all of
Agent Farallon's files?

36:38.773 --> 36:40.858
Everything that Rachel
Hemming's wire picked up

36:40.942 --> 36:43.236
while she was his CI
on the Broyles case.

36:43.444 --> 36:45.321
It all pertains to our drug op.

36:45.405 --> 36:46.281
What do youneed?

36:49.450 --> 36:50.285
That.

36:51.578 --> 36:53.371
That proves that Farallon lied.

36:53.580 --> 36:54.622
What are you talking about?

36:54.706 --> 36:57.959
Well,he said that he didn't get any
transmission from Rachel this morning.

36:58.042 --> 37:00.670
Well,no,she died before
he got the chance.

37:01.212 --> 37:02.839
Then explain this last date.

37:03.798 --> 37:06.050
December 17,9:38 a. m.

37:06.593 --> 37:07.594
That was this morning.

37:07.802 --> 37:09.262
Right before she was murdered.

37:11.431 --> 37:14.767
Jeremy,hey. Didn't expect
you this early. What's up?

37:14.893 --> 37:16.853
My guys tell me you've
been asking questions.

37:17.103 --> 37:18.771
Questions? About what?

37:18.980 --> 37:21.482
Everything. Stuff you
don't need to know.

37:21.649 --> 37:23.234
Paranoid much, Jeremy?

37:23.484 --> 37:24.861
You should lay off your own tweak.

37:25.737 --> 37:26.905
Somebody got to you.

37:27.572 --> 37:28.197
What?

37:29.032 --> 37:29.616
A cop?

37:30.491 --> 37:31.659
We're together on this.

37:32.368 --> 37:33.036
You hear me?

37:33.453 --> 37:34.329
Together.

37:39.751 --> 37:42.921
Things were about to go sideways.
Why would he stop recording?

37:43.212 --> 37:44.797
He knew her real well.

37:44.881 --> 37:46.925
She's done this before. Maybe
he didn't sense a threat.

37:46.966 --> 37:50.053
No,no. He knew that there was a threat
because she said the word "together. "

37:51.012 --> 37:52.472
- Together?
- That was their safe word.

37:52.513 --> 37:55.767
That was the same safe word he used
with his last C.I., Jane Duncroft.

37:58.645 --> 38:00.188
If that was the safe word,

38:01.022 --> 38:02.315
he should have helped her.

38:02.357 --> 38:03.483
Yeah, he should have.

38:05.652 --> 38:07.362
But I think he wanted her dead.

38:15.745 --> 38:16.788
What's this about?

38:19.749 --> 38:20.625
Natalia?

38:22.627 --> 38:24.879
I've run hundreds of interrogations.

38:25.171 --> 38:26.923
You think I don't know that stare?

38:27.757 --> 38:29.133
Just cut to the chase.

38:29.175 --> 38:30.176
I'll
do th-

38:30.218 --> 38:32.178
you sat back and did nothing

38:32.220 --> 38:34.931
while your confidential
informant was murdered.

38:35.306 --> 38:36.516
How does that grab you?

38:37.016 --> 38:37.809
Listen up.

38:38.434 --> 38:39.477
Both of you.

38:40.103 --> 38:42.814
I'm here as a courtesy, okay?

38:43.314 --> 38:45.900
So don't think for a second
that I'm gonna put up with your

38:45.942 --> 38:48.528
penny-ante local PD nonsense,okay?

38:48.570 --> 38:50.947
You guys are way out of
your league, here, man.

38:56.202 --> 38:58.162
Is that a fact?

39:08.840 --> 39:10.758
We have the tape from this morning.

39:20.226 --> 39:21.477
Rachel was

39:21.853 --> 39:23.146
a great C.I.

39:23.813 --> 39:25.648
All her work was about to pay off.

39:25.773 --> 39:26.774
Ourwork.

39:27.817 --> 39:29.819
I had no idea Broyles was onto her.

39:29.861 --> 39:32.238
She did,and that's why
she tried to contact you.

39:32.280 --> 39:33.948
You sat there. You listened.

39:33.990 --> 39:37.118
She said the safe word
and you did nothing.

39:37.869 --> 39:39.787
All to cover up your affair.

39:41.873 --> 39:42.498
I...

39:43.541 --> 39:46.002
figured when the case
was over, so were we.

39:46.628 --> 39:47.837
I'd let her go

39:48.129 --> 39:49.088
and that'd be that.

39:49.130 --> 39:50.924
Yeah, and then she told
you she was pregnant.

39:50.965 --> 39:51.925
Listen, my wife...

39:52.091 --> 39:53.676
my, my job...

39:55.136 --> 39:57.639
if that got out, I would
have lost everything.

39:58.848 --> 40:02.060
Jeremy, hey. Didn't expect
you this early. What's up?

40:02.143 --> 40:04.229
My guys tell me you've
been asking questions.

40:05.230 --> 40:06.940
Questions? About what?

40:07.523 --> 40:10.109
Everything. Stuff you
don't need to know.

40:10.693 --> 40:12.362
Paranoid much, Jeremy?

40:12.570 --> 40:13.821
You should lay off your own tweak.

40:14.239 --> 40:15.323
Somebody got to you.

40:16.157 --> 40:16.741
What?

40:17.575 --> 40:18.159
A cop?

40:18.409 --> 40:19.410
We're together on this.

40:20.078 --> 40:20.870
You hear me?

40:21.412 --> 40:22.121
Together.

40:32.882 --> 40:36.177
And in that moment,I saw
my life in fast-forward.

40:36.761 --> 40:38.346
I knew how everything would play out.

40:38.471 --> 40:39.514
Not everything.

40:40.765 --> 40:43.142
She may have been pregnant,
but it wasn't your child.

40:44.394 --> 40:45.019
What?

40:47.063 --> 40:47.855
That's not true.

40:47.939 --> 40:51.359
That istrue,Agent, and
DNA has confirmed it.

40:54.737 --> 40:57.282
You were so busy with your investigation

40:57.323 --> 40:59.492
you forgot that she was a human being.

41:00.618 --> 41:01.619
They...

41:02.245 --> 41:03.871
were human beings.

41:06.374 --> 41:10.503
Not bad, for a couple of
penny-ante locals, huh?

41:31.900 --> 41:33.902
Why don't I feel better about this?

41:34.068 --> 41:36.362
You took a dangerous man off thstreet.

41:36.905 --> 41:38.781
Should have done it three years ago.

41:39.365 --> 41:42.243
Sometimes it takes that long.

41:42.911 --> 41:44.829
Tell that to Rachel Hemming.

41:46.706 --> 41:47.707
You know...

41:48.750 --> 41:51.419
there's a way you could honor her life.

41:52.962 --> 41:54.213
How is that?

41:55.173 --> 41:56.925
Forgive yourself.

41:59.469 --> 42:01.179
You've earned it, Natalia.

42:01.888 --> 42:02.972
Take it.
