WEBVTT

00:03.110 --> 00:05.599
Does anyone know how long
it takes papier-mache to dry?

00:05.600 --> 00:06.437
Three hours longer

00:06.438 --> 00:08.343
than it took Duncan to
think up this assignment.

00:08.344 --> 00:09.697
I think 's really
gonna appreciate

00:09.698 --> 00:12.751
the extra work we did expanding
our evolutionary chart.

00:12.752 --> 00:15.330
Oh, Britta, can you hold up
the final stage of humanity?

00:15.331 --> 00:17.915
I still think that man is
going to evolve into woman,

00:17.916 --> 00:20.246
not dragon monster
with three legs.

00:20.247 --> 00:21.385
Three legs?

00:22.376 --> 00:23.685
Well, it's been real...

00:23.884 --> 00:25.486
At least the paste smell has...

00:25.589 --> 00:27.081
But I have a date to catch.

00:27.082 --> 00:29.475
Or should I say a catch to date.

00:29.476 --> 00:31.286
Oof, hope you just
come up with that.

00:31.287 --> 00:33.752
Look out! Drive-by deaning!

00:33.767 --> 00:34.724
Kidding.

00:34.725 --> 00:36.944
Just a non-violent
verbal reminder.

00:36.945 --> 00:40.086
The local shelter is having a
puppy parade this afternoon.

00:40.087 --> 00:41.101
Ohh!

00:41.102 --> 00:42.678
Oh! I want to lick it.

00:42.679 --> 00:45.428
I expect all of
you to lend a paw.

00:45.824 --> 00:47.203
Except you, Jeffrey.

00:47.204 --> 00:49.166
I know you've gotta catch to date.

00:50.324 --> 00:51.777
Oh, like you're
famous for your wit."

00:51.778 --> 00:52.583
Puppy parade?

00:52.584 --> 00:53.777
I am in.

00:53.851 --> 00:55.819
Want to see if those wiener
dogs are born that way,

00:55.820 --> 00:58.141
or if they start off normal
and then get wiener.

00:58.628 --> 01:00.209
Abed, did you pick up my pen?

01:00.210 --> 01:02.084
It's a purple pen with a gel grip.

01:02.085 --> 01:04.260
Nope. I'm strictly
mechanical pencils these days.

01:04.262 --> 01:05.293
More relatable?

01:05.294 --> 01:06.675
It was just here.

01:06.987 --> 01:09.265
You okay, Annie? Chocolate?

01:09.411 --> 01:11.291
Would you like me to push
you to the parade, Pierce?

01:11.292 --> 01:12.124
Oh, no, thanks.

01:12.125 --> 01:14.224
I don't want people think
of me as a handicap.

01:14.225 --> 01:16.538
If anything, this chair
makes me more than a human.

01:21.711 --> 01:23.963
You move it by blowing into this,
uh, tube here.

01:23.964 --> 01:25.419
It's the most expensive one.

01:25.420 --> 01:27.716
I outbid three hospitals
for this baby,

01:27.717 --> 01:30.289
and it was worth every penny.

01:35.018 --> 01:35.801
Oh.

01:35.802 --> 01:36.767
Oh!

01:40.305 --> 01:42.167
Wait! Please just wait.

01:42.562 --> 01:45.085
I'm sorry, but I need
to know who took my pen.

01:45.526 --> 01:46.594
Uh...

01:47.164 --> 01:49.204
Sorry, I don't see it.

01:49.205 --> 01:50.981
Yeah, sorry, Annie.

01:52.185 --> 01:53.061
No!

01:53.724 --> 01:55.583
Not "sorry, Annie."

01:55.651 --> 01:59.073
We passed "sorry,
Annie" eight pens ago!

01:59.074 --> 02:01.780
I keep bringing pens,
and you guys keep taking them,

02:01.781 --> 02:04.865
and I'm afraid I
am putting my foot down.

02:04.971 --> 02:07.524
Okay. Well, now,
Annie has made it clear

02:07.525 --> 02:08.655
that this is an issue,

02:08.656 --> 02:11.728
so from now on, we need to be more
respectful of her things.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.027
- Okay.
- Cool.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.290 --> 02:34.833
All right,
it's not on the floor,

02:34.834 --> 02:37.930
so whoever accidentally took...
Not accidentally!

02:37.931 --> 02:41.910
Accidents don't just happen over
and over and over again, okay?

02:41.911 --> 02:43.355
This isn't budget daycare.

02:43.445 --> 02:45.690
Okay, whoever insidiously

02:45.691 --> 02:47.422
and with great malice aforethought

02:47.423 --> 02:48.752
abducted Annie's pen,

02:48.753 --> 02:51.376
confess, repent,
and relinquish so we can leave.

02:51.377 --> 02:52.824
Maybe nobody took it.

02:52.825 --> 02:54.226
Sometimes I think I lost something

02:54.227 --> 02:55.249
really important to me,

02:55.250 --> 02:57.224
and it turns out I already ate it.

02:57.225 --> 02:59.371
I didn't eat my pen, Troy.

02:59.372 --> 03:01.743
I know I brought it, and now it's gone.

03:02.321 --> 03:03.551
I took a photo.

03:05.408 --> 03:06.435
Aha!

03:06.443 --> 03:08.469
Aha. I'm zooming.

03:08.470 --> 03:09.809
See? See?

03:09.810 --> 03:11.794
I took this ten minutes ago.

03:11.795 --> 03:13.507
My pen was on the table.

03:13.508 --> 03:15.149
No one has come in or out since.

03:15.150 --> 03:17.522
One of you has my pen right now.

03:19.718 --> 03:20.739
Annie.

03:21.996 --> 03:22.880
It's a pen.

03:22.881 --> 03:23.914
It's not a pen!

03:23.915 --> 03:25.127
It's a principle.

03:28.412 --> 03:30.434
Not a good time to get
a stick of gum. Okay.

03:30.435 --> 03:31.701
Are we going to the
puppy parade or not?

03:31.702 --> 03:33.486
Because this is starting to
feel like a bottle episode.

03:33.487 --> 03:34.985
Again with the TV crap.

03:34.986 --> 03:37.391
Hey, meatball,
did you take Annie's pen

03:37.392 --> 03:40.756
to make life more like Benny
hill or whatever you do?

03:41.195 --> 03:42.055
Abed?

03:42.056 --> 03:43.991
I wouldn't do that. I
hate bottle episodes.

03:43.992 --> 03:46.136
They're wall-to-wall facial
expression and emotional nuance.

03:46.137 --> 03:47.625
I might as well sit in the
corner with a bucket on head.

03:47.626 --> 03:50.063
Well, I have a
photography project to finish,

03:50.064 --> 03:51.314
and my grandmother's hands

03:51.315 --> 03:53.098
aren't going to take
close-ups of themselves.

03:53.099 --> 03:54.548
Hasta la later.

03:54.720 --> 03:55.703
Hmm!

03:56.208 --> 03:58.070
Was that "hmm" directed at me?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.495
If the "hmm" fits.

03:59.496 --> 04:00.881
I don't have your pen, Annie.

04:00.882 --> 04:02.110
I'm always lending you supplies.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.388
You never come prepared.

04:03.389 --> 04:05.481
If it's so important to you,
here, have my pen.

04:05.482 --> 04:06.255
That's my pen.

04:06.256 --> 04:07.775
Well, whatever, people.

04:07.776 --> 04:09.140
They're just things.

04:09.141 --> 04:10.406
Since they're just things,

04:10.407 --> 04:11.599
I don't suppose you'd
mind letting us

04:11.600 --> 04:13.093
take a quick look-see
inside your bag?

04:13.094 --> 04:15.030
Oh, I'd very much mind, Annie.

04:15.031 --> 04:18.260
As a "quick" invasion
of civil liberties.

04:19.692 --> 04:20.599
Oh, man.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.421
Oh, it all starts with a quick
look-see into someone's bag

04:23.422 --> 04:25.015
and then it's a brisk peeka-roony

04:25.016 --> 04:26.054
at our phone records,

04:26.055 --> 04:29.205
and before you can say "1984,"
the thought police

04:29.206 --> 04:31.644
are forcy-worcing you
to bend and spread.

04:31.645 --> 04:32.786
Bend and spread?

04:32.787 --> 04:34.169
Are the thought police
gonna make love to us?

04:34.170 --> 04:36.006
Do they find
thoughts in our butts?

04:36.019 --> 04:37.271
I knew I should
have read that book.

04:37.272 --> 04:38.993
Britta, stop using
the constitution

04:38.994 --> 04:40.120
as a baby blanket.

04:40.121 --> 04:42.327
Last week, she invoked the
Freedom of Information Act

04:42.328 --> 04:43.945
to request photocopies
of my notes.

04:43.946 --> 04:45.208
That's pretty good.

04:45.209 --> 04:47.280
Well, excuse me for living free.

04:47.281 --> 04:49.110
Come on, Stoney,
we all know the pen's in your bag!

04:49.111 --> 04:51.421
- Yeah! Come on!
- Come on, dump it.

04:56.209 --> 04:57.284
Happy?

04:57.327 --> 04:58.727
Not if that's a used q-tip.

04:58.728 --> 04:59.696
- Eww.
- Oh!

05:01.577 --> 05:04.250
Welcome to the gross
business of martial law.

05:04.251 --> 05:07.133
Welcome to what used
to be individuality,

05:07.134 --> 05:10.269
seized and disintegrated
by cowardly groupthink.

05:10.270 --> 05:13.278
Welcome, my friends!
Welcome to the machine!

05:13.279 --> 05:15.193
Well, Annie,
it looks like you were wrong.

05:15.194 --> 05:17.360
Britta does come
prepared for one thing.

05:17.856 --> 05:19.271
Or six.

05:19.457 --> 05:21.204
- Big weekend?
- Can't complain.

05:21.205 --> 05:22.780
Razzle pzazzle.

05:23.049 --> 05:24.553
Attention, students!

05:24.554 --> 05:27.258
The puppy parade is
starting on the quad!

05:27.259 --> 05:28.149
Better come quick.

05:28.150 --> 05:30.247
With every passing moment,
these puppies grow older

05:30.248 --> 05:31.934
and less deserving
of our attention.

05:31.935 --> 05:32.779
Whoa whoa whoa!

05:32.780 --> 05:34.281
Where do you people
think you're going?

05:34.282 --> 05:35.740
Uh, have you ever gone

05:35.741 --> 05:37.732
to a puppy parade
halfway through, Britta?

05:38.140 --> 05:39.291
It is pointless.

05:39.292 --> 05:40.845
Then you clearly stole the pen.

05:40.846 --> 05:42.737
The Patriot Act cuts both ways.

05:42.738 --> 05:44.430
Actually, it's pretty one-sided.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.450
That's kind of the point.

05:45.451 --> 05:46.355
Here's my point.

05:46.356 --> 05:48.182
Whoever's the pen thief
is just stood there

05:48.183 --> 05:49.825
and watched me get Guantanamoed.

05:49.826 --> 05:51.026
And I'd like to know who it is,

05:51.027 --> 05:54.023
so I can let them know that
they have lost my trust forever.

05:54.024 --> 05:54.941
It's a bottle episode.

05:54.942 --> 05:56.724
Britta, we're sorry
we embarrassed you

05:56.725 --> 05:57.991
and looked at your
prophylactic equipment.

05:57.992 --> 06:00.490
Your lifestyle mistakes
are none of our business.

06:00.491 --> 06:01.789
Oh, thanks, Shirley.

06:01.790 --> 06:03.997
But now let's rustle
through your tampons and wallet

06:03.998 --> 06:05.454
so we can apologize to you.

06:05.455 --> 06:08.037
Oh, I'm sure everybody
here knows that I don't steal.

06:08.038 --> 06:09.318
Have you checked your bag,
Shirley?

06:09.319 --> 06:10.849
If you took it by mistake,
I forgive you.

06:10.850 --> 06:12.735
Oh, so if I took it,
it's larceny,

06:12.736 --> 06:15.135
but if you find it under mother hen,
it's a mistake.

06:15.136 --> 06:16.844
Mother hen? I think
we're about the same age.

06:16.845 --> 06:18.694
Sure, unless time is linear.

06:18.695 --> 06:19.759
I'll make your ass linear.

06:19.760 --> 06:20.813
That doesn't make any sense.

06:20.814 --> 06:21.864
I'll make ya ass sense.

06:21.865 --> 06:23.529
Girls, don't get
your panties puckered.

06:23.530 --> 06:24.770
We all know what
we're really thinking.

06:24.771 --> 06:27.796
If... and I mean if...
the culprit is among us,

06:27.797 --> 06:30.126
statistically speaking, it's Troy.

06:30.760 --> 06:34.930
Yes, we were all just
thinking that in 1856.

06:34.931 --> 06:36.436
1856.

06:37.347 --> 06:38.751
What if a ghost took the pen?

06:38.752 --> 06:40.296
- Please forgive him.
- For what?

06:40.297 --> 06:41.718
For stealing the pen, dummy.

06:41.719 --> 06:42.840
Why would I take her pen?

06:42.841 --> 06:44.444
I don't even like having my own.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.556
It's probably under
one of Pierce's casts.

06:46.557 --> 06:48.532
He uses everything to itch his legs.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.157
We're on our third DVD remote.

06:50.158 --> 06:51.703
If I took the pen, I'd say so.

06:51.704 --> 06:52.884
You probably forgot.

06:52.885 --> 06:54.683
You've been popping
painkillers like tic-tacs.

06:54.684 --> 06:56.138
Oh, yeah, right.

06:56.913 --> 07:00.416
"Side effects: Verbal dysphasia

07:00.991 --> 07:02.556
and octopus loss."

07:02.557 --> 07:05.290
I don't see anything on this
squirrel about memory, Troy.

07:05.291 --> 07:06.898
Now I want to know who has it.

07:06.899 --> 07:08.075
Yeah, nice try Shirley,

07:08.076 --> 07:09.486
that doesn't take
you off the list.

07:09.487 --> 07:11.236
Jeff, you're in charge.

07:11.237 --> 07:12.593
I demand you deal with this

07:12.594 --> 07:13.871
There's nothing to deal with.

07:13.872 --> 07:14.672
I'll say.

07:14.673 --> 07:16.401
Ok, alright, alright.

07:16.651 --> 07:18.599
Everyone breathe.

07:21.345 --> 07:22.834
- You know what this is?
- Yep.

07:22.835 --> 07:24.917
Shut up. This is a normal day

07:24.918 --> 07:27.340
with a bunch of friends who
are done studying

07:27.341 --> 07:29.025
and a pen that maybe rolled away.

07:29.026 --> 07:31.362
- "Rolled away"?
- Or fell down someone's shoe.

07:31.363 --> 07:32.823
- Let's check shoes.
- Annie!

07:34.538 --> 07:36.383
Fine, fine.

07:37.054 --> 07:41.206
Someone in this room
is hiding your pen.

07:41.207 --> 07:42.238
Want to know why?

07:42.239 --> 07:43.874
They feel terrible.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.309
They made a mistake.

07:45.310 --> 07:47.039
They waited too long come forward,

07:47.040 --> 07:48.206
and now they feel bad.

07:48.207 --> 07:49.438
- They should.
- Mm-hmm!

07:49.439 --> 07:52.210
Okay. Okay, so, pen thief,

07:52.211 --> 07:53.760
we understand what happened,

07:53.761 --> 07:54.938
and we forgive you.

07:54.939 --> 07:56.687
- If you confess and apologize!
- Yes.

07:56.855 --> 07:58.295
Right. But here's the trick.

07:58.296 --> 08:00.838
Because this person
now has no reason

08:00.839 --> 08:02.415
not to come forward,

08:02.416 --> 08:04.725
if, by some chance,
I get to the count of three,

08:04.726 --> 08:07.844
and nobody comes forward,
guess what.

08:07.845 --> 08:12.013
We have to accept that no
one has the pen, don't we?

08:12.618 --> 08:13.815
Don't we?

08:15.533 --> 08:17.588
Good so here we go.

08:18.194 --> 08:19.268
One.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.585
Two.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.605
Pierce, you have
something to tell us?

08:27.606 --> 08:29.190
Yes. Is it me,

08:29.191 --> 08:31.334
or has it become really obvious
that Jeff took the pen

08:31.335 --> 08:32.815
- Yes!
- Definitely.

08:33.087 --> 08:35.183
You want to make a bet, you jerks?

08:35.184 --> 08:37.668
Lockdown! Abed, seal the doors.

08:37.871 --> 08:40.886
Nobody leaves until
this pen shows up.

08:40.888 --> 08:41.712
I don't like this.

08:41.714 --> 08:44.096
Yeah? Tell it to the
pen you might have.

08:44.164 --> 08:46.038
Gwynnifer? Hi. Yeah, it's me.

08:46.039 --> 08:47.394
I can't make it.

08:47.491 --> 08:49.797
Well, tell your
disappointment to suck it.

08:49.798 --> 08:51.899
I'm doing a bottle episode!

09:11.073 --> 09:12.095
Okay.

09:12.691 --> 09:13.943
You just became my hero.

09:13.944 --> 09:14.894
Thank you.

09:14.990 --> 09:16.143
No pen.

09:16.546 --> 09:17.501
I can see that.

09:17.502 --> 09:19.014
Why do you keep taking
that tone with me?

09:19.015 --> 09:19.964
Oh, I'll field that

09:19.965 --> 09:21.449
because if nobody
else has this pen,

09:21.450 --> 09:23.498
it means at so point,
you realized you had it

09:23.499 --> 09:26.215
and were too embarrassed to say,
and we get to kill you.

09:26.216 --> 09:29.594
I'm not hiding my own pen,
you paranoid weirdo.

09:29.595 --> 09:31.066
Everybody stay within each
other's eyelines, please.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.015
One of you's a monster.

09:32.016 --> 09:33.978
- Me next, right?
- Hold on.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.061
Can we please consider

09:35.062 --> 09:36.519
the threshold that
we are crossing?

09:36.520 --> 09:38.614
We don't trust Abed?

09:39.130 --> 09:40.472
He shredded my backpack.

09:40.473 --> 09:41.517
He freed my pet monkey.

09:41.518 --> 09:42.932
Because we corrupted him.

09:42.933 --> 09:44.192
He's our innocent.

09:44.193 --> 09:45.283
He put gum in your hair.

09:45.284 --> 09:46.289
Empty the bag, Abed.

09:46.290 --> 09:47.100
Uh, Pierce,

09:47.101 --> 09:49.188
- you don't have a bag? 
- Giraffe.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.977
Uh, Jeff, you don't have a bag?

09:51.201 --> 09:52.666
Oh, I could never
deprive the world

09:52.667 --> 09:54.791
of the portion of my chest
the strap would cover.

09:54.792 --> 09:56.150
Makes sense. So what's left?

09:56.151 --> 09:58.071
Shirley, a little hugging and crying,
and then we're done?

09:58.072 --> 10:01.160
Wait, Abed, why is my name in here?

10:01.161 --> 10:01.882
That's mine.

10:01.883 --> 10:04.538
And Shirley's and Annie's?

10:04.539 --> 10:05.251
What is it?

10:05.252 --> 10:05.922
Charts.

10:05.923 --> 10:07.649
Some kind of calendar?

10:07.650 --> 10:09.079
That's my personal
private business.

10:09.555 --> 10:13.722
Annie, 4 on, 28 off, next, November 10th.

10:13.723 --> 10:16.544
Britta, 5 on, 27 off...

10:16.576 --> 10:20.501
Oh my God. Are you charting our
menstrual cycles?

10:20.502 --> 10:21.602
What?!

10:21.603 --> 10:22.590
Gross!

10:22.591 --> 10:24.296
Abed, this is so personal!

10:24.297 --> 10:25.384
And so accurate.

10:25.385 --> 10:26.527
Abed, this is really creepy.

10:26.528 --> 10:28.059
I don't understand why you
would do this.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.120
I can explain.

10:29.983 --> 10:31.557
Oh. I thought you'd
keep yelling over me.

10:31.558 --> 10:32.698
Okay, I can explain.

10:32.699 --> 10:33.887
You know I have trouble
reading people,

10:33.888 --> 10:35.090
and say the wrong things, sometimes,

10:35.091 --> 10:36.671
and I noticed it was happening
more often with you three

10:36.672 --> 10:38.042
than it was with the others.

10:38.043 --> 10:39.614
And then I noticed
fluctuating patterns,

10:39.615 --> 10:40.679
and I started graphing them,

10:40.680 --> 10:42.964
and by the time I realized
what I was actually measuring,

10:42.965 --> 10:45.895
it had started to yield really
positive results for everybody,

10:45.896 --> 10:46.953
so I kept doing it.

10:46.954 --> 10:48.532
Were you ever gonna
tell us about this?

10:48.533 --> 10:51.021
I... I feel so violated.

10:53.365 --> 10:54.441
More chocolate?

10:55.945 --> 10:57.955
Oh! Get away from me!

10:57.956 --> 10:59.551
Abed just became my hero.

11:00.392 --> 11:01.958
- Can I have a little...
- No!

11:01.959 --> 11:02.888
Sheesh.

11:02.889 --> 11:04.767
Guess it's true what they
say about the sync-up.

11:05.442 --> 11:06.590
Okay, if I could
just take this time

11:06.591 --> 11:07.699
to share a few words of sarcasm

11:07.700 --> 11:09.266
with whoever it is
that took this pen.

11:09.267 --> 11:11.258
I want to say thank you for
doing this to me

11:11.729 --> 11:12.766
for a while I thought
I'd have to suffer

11:12.767 --> 11:13.662
through a puppy parade,

11:13.663 --> 11:15.174
but I much prefer
being entombed alive

11:15.175 --> 11:16.116
in a mausoleum of feelings

11:16.117 --> 11:18.206
I can neither understand
nor reciprocate.

11:18.466 --> 11:20.470
So whoever you are,
can I get you anything?

11:20.623 --> 11:21.927
Ice cream? Best friend medal?

11:21.928 --> 11:23.329
Anything? Mm-mmm?

11:24.014 --> 11:25.884
Okay, sarcasm over.

11:25.885 --> 11:26.804
You're last up, Shirley.

11:26.805 --> 11:28.437
Dump your comedically
huge bag and end this.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.367
Uh, no, thank you.

11:33.145 --> 11:36.120
Well, well, well, Harvey Keitel.

11:36.121 --> 11:39.058
Well, what do you know,
Henry David Thoreau.

11:39.059 --> 11:42.611
My oh my, Mike Tyson

11:43.507 --> 11:44.390
just empty the bag.

11:44.391 --> 11:46.160
No! I don't have Annie's pen.

11:46.161 --> 11:48.418
I'm simply a Christian woman
that doesn't open her bag.

11:48.419 --> 11:50.365
What did the Christian
woman think would happen

11:50.366 --> 11:51.760
when we got to her bag?

11:51.761 --> 11:53.398
The Christian woman thought
you'd find it on the Muslim.

11:53.399 --> 11:54.300
Real nice!

11:54.301 --> 11:55.783
Nicer than you, condom carrier!

11:55.784 --> 11:58.131
- Dump the bag or you're guilty!
- No!

11:58.658 --> 12:00.431
Oh, lord, he's thrown a clot!

12:00.432 --> 12:01.465
Pierce! Call 911!

12:03.248 --> 12:05.112
No! No! No!

12:05.113 --> 12:06.768
Pierce, you didn't
need to do that.

12:06.769 --> 12:07.699
Yes, I did.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.100
All you guys do is talk,

12:09.101 --> 12:10.871
leaving me to do the
things you won't do.

12:10.872 --> 12:12.055
People like you are the reason

12:12.056 --> 12:14.325
we took so long to
get into Vietnam.

12:16.305 --> 12:18.292
Is this what you were
trying to hide, Shirley?

12:18.748 --> 12:20.435
A pregnancy test?

12:20.436 --> 12:21.682
And more importantly,

12:21.683 --> 12:24.538
are they seriously marketing
pregnancy tests to black women

12:24.539 --> 12:26.424
guys! This is a
terribly childish way

12:26.425 --> 12:28.415
to handle this kind of situation.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.122
Does this mean you have a new boyfriend?

12:31.123 --> 12:32.328
Who, who, who?

12:33.378 --> 12:35.861
Not that it's, uh,
anyone's business...

12:35.922 --> 12:39.200
I recently reconnected with
my husband over Labor Day,

12:39.201 --> 12:40.925
and it seems the Lord
may have a plan for us

12:40.926 --> 12:43.373
that doesn't include that
stripper slut he ran away with.

12:43.374 --> 12:44.859
You're not pregnant, Shirley.
It's impossible.

12:44.860 --> 12:46.248
Why does everybody think I'm old?

12:46.249 --> 12:48.080
I'm around Jeff's age!
I have a uterus!

12:48.081 --> 12:49.236
No, no. According to my charts,

12:49.237 --> 12:50.355
you couldn't
have conceived Labor Day weekend

12:50.356 --> 12:53.053
you would have been
ovulating on Halloween.

12:53.532 --> 12:55.032
Which is just as well,
because if you're gonna have

12:55.033 --> 12:55.830
a pregnant woman in one of these,

12:55.831 --> 12:57.589
I say go elevator
labor or go home.

12:57.590 --> 12:58.677
Halloween?

12:59.311 --> 13:00.738
Well, that's that, then.

13:00.739 --> 13:01.731
Yeah, what a relief.

13:01.732 --> 13:03.034
Looks like someone narrowly avoided

13:03.035 --> 13:04.571
a "lifestyle mistake" of their own.

13:04.572 --> 13:07.897
Oh! Or is it only bad if you
sleep with unmarried men?

13:07.898 --> 13:09.787
The Bible doesn't
recognize divorce, Britta!

13:09.788 --> 13:11.327
When you marry a man,
he's your man!

13:11.328 --> 13:12.673
Yeah, and after he
marries someone else,

13:12.674 --> 13:14.937
if you jump into the sack with him,
you're an angel,

13:14.938 --> 13:17.339
so long as you don't
use protection?

13:17.340 --> 13:19.734
I'm so glad you're
enjoying this.

13:19.735 --> 13:22.397
And I hope whoever stole
that pen enjoys it in hell!

13:23.815 --> 13:26.232
- Nice try, Stephen Fry.
- "Stephen Fry."

13:26.233 --> 13:27.579
We all have an agreement.

13:27.580 --> 13:29.496
Nobody leaves till we find it.

13:31.306 --> 13:32.931
- Oh
- Get off. Here we go.

13:32.932 --> 13:34.881
We are gonna find this pen!

13:34.882 --> 13:38.196
We are gonna find that pen!

13:38.197 --> 13:40.423
- oh!
- And if we can't find it,

13:40.424 --> 13:42.549
our children will find it!

13:42.550 --> 13:44.304
Is it over here in these books?

13:44.305 --> 13:47.932
This pen? This incredible,
magical pen

13:47.933 --> 13:50.506
that nobody knows how
it could disappear?

13:50.611 --> 13:52.434
Oh, maybe it's right in here!

13:52.435 --> 13:54.513
Guys, this is school property!

13:54.514 --> 13:56.455
Can we just forget it?

13:56.797 --> 13:58.110
It's a pen!

14:07.781 --> 14:09.605
It's a pen now?

14:11.274 --> 14:12.257
Really?

14:13.069 --> 14:15.332
It's not a principle anymore

14:15.431 --> 14:16.986
now it's a pen?

14:19.446 --> 14:21.137
Why the change of heart?

14:22.194 --> 14:24.059
You're not seriously
accusing me.

14:24.060 --> 14:25.653
We searched my bag!

14:25.654 --> 14:28.063
Which is exactly the
last place you'd put it

14:28.064 --> 14:30.423
if you found it halfway
through all this.

14:30.424 --> 14:33.383
In fact, assuming that one
of us does have the pen,

14:33.384 --> 14:35.775
who among us has
the most incentive

14:35.776 --> 14:37.962
to make sure it never
sees the light of day?

14:37.963 --> 14:39.185
- You want to go there?
- Yeah.

14:39.186 --> 14:40.370
- I'll go there.
- Okay.

14:40.371 --> 14:41.649
- I was born there.
- Really?

14:41.650 --> 14:44.189
There's a placard
the commemorating me!

14:44.829 --> 14:46.736
What's going on,
and how can I help?

14:47.057 --> 14:48.318
Anie, relax.

14:48.319 --> 14:49.463
No, you relax, Jeff.

14:49.464 --> 14:52.403
Or are you scared that if you do,
my pen will fall out?

14:52.897 --> 14:54.709
You precocious little bitch!

14:55.007 --> 14:56.042
Okay, guys, guys! Hey!

14:56.043 --> 14:57.067
Guys, stop!

14:57.068 --> 14:58.579
You're being complely illogical!

14:58.995 --> 15:00.645
We need to flip up the table,
divide the group by gender,

15:00.646 --> 15:02.165
and then search each
other in our underwear.

15:02.166 --> 15:03.187
What?

15:04.626 --> 15:05.644
Now what?

15:05.645 --> 15:08.228
Everybody shake.
Enough to dislodge.

15:11.775 --> 15:13.095
Okay, anything hit the floor?

15:13.235 --> 15:14.374
No.

15:14.712 --> 15:15.940
What are those
underwear made out of?

15:15.941 --> 15:17.099
They look luxurious.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.954
Oh. They're an
organic soy-cotton blend.

15:18.955 --> 15:20.940
This Gwynnifer must
be real special.

15:20.941 --> 15:21.973
Don't you usually wear

15:21.974 --> 15:24.089
the stripey turquoise
beetlejuice numbers?

15:24.090 --> 15:25.169
What does she mean "usually"?

15:25.170 --> 15:28.166
All right, end of the road.

15:28.167 --> 15:29.370
We've torn apart the room,

15:29.371 --> 15:30.708
we've stripped.

15:30.709 --> 15:34.621
There is absolutely
no place left...

15:36.320 --> 15:37.329
No.

15:38.607 --> 15:39.561
No!

15:44.619 --> 15:45.331
No.

15:45.332 --> 15:47.746
Noooooo! No!

15:50.049 --> 15:52.093
Damn it. Broke my scissors.

15:52.538 --> 15:55.016
Here. Be careful.

15:55.017 --> 15:56.687
This is the last pair we have.

15:57.472 --> 15:59.091
Also, don't cut his legs.

16:00.881 --> 16:02.372
I'm worried we've gone too far.

16:02.373 --> 16:04.223
This is how super villains are created.

16:04.224 --> 16:06.360
Can't you just make an inspiring
Winger speech about trust,

16:06.361 --> 16:08.172
throw in a few digs at
an easy celebrity target,

16:08.173 --> 16:09.511
and put a ribbon on this thing?

16:09.744 --> 16:12.530
Abed, think about this for one second

16:12.531 --> 16:14.305
if a single one of
us leaves this room

16:14.306 --> 16:15.775
before we find that pen,

16:15.797 --> 16:19.441
how can any of us trust anyone
in this group ever again?

16:21.595 --> 16:22.744
What's your hurry?

16:22.745 --> 16:24.159
I'm clothing myself.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.157
I'm not comfortable standing around
in my all-together

16:26.158 --> 16:27.668
like you two anorex jeze...

16:27.669 --> 16:29.816
Oh! I'm so sorry.

16:29.859 --> 16:31.184
That was really mean.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.865
I don't know where that came from.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.493
We've all been
through a lot today.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.105
And I'm sure this pregnancy scare

16:37.106 --> 16:39.439
been weighing on you
all week, right?

16:39.956 --> 16:42.737
And maybe that's
why you took my pen?

16:42.738 --> 16:43.461
What?!

16:43.462 --> 16:44.776
Where are you hiding it,
judgy beans?

16:45.815 --> 16:48.221
All right, here we go.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.980
It smells like a
Waffle House sink!

16:54.981 --> 16:58.370
Pierce, are you using Slim
Jims to scratch your legs?

16:58.371 --> 17:02.021
Have we not gotten to a
place free of judgment yet?

17:02.485 --> 17:03.868
This isn't it, this isn't it.

17:03.869 --> 17:04.931
Where is it? Where's the pen?

17:04.932 --> 17:06.103
Where's the pen?!

17:06.704 --> 17:08.011
Where's the pen?

17:09.771 --> 17:10.325
Great.

17:10.326 --> 17:11.811
It's getting a
little chilly outside,

17:11.813 --> 17:14.373
so the animal wranglers have
asked that every student

17:14.374 --> 17:15.794
pick up a puppy and hold it,

17:15.795 --> 17:17.890
so they stay warm
while the volunteers

17:17.891 --> 17:20.026
hand out tiny, puppy-sized hats.

17:20.103 --> 17:23.362
Honestly, I don't know why I'm
even making these announcements.

17:23.363 --> 17:26.830
There can't be anyone who
isn't already on the quad!

17:36.182 --> 17:37.392
Annie, I'd just like to say,

17:37.393 --> 17:40.011
on behalf of whoever
actually stole this pen,

17:40.012 --> 17:42.307
I real am sorry about all this.

17:42.308 --> 17:43.520
I knew it was you.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.503
I knew it was you.

17:44.504 --> 17:46.356
All I know is it
could be any of you.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.787
And for all we know, it's you.

17:48.788 --> 17:51.029
I wish it were. I really do.

17:51.030 --> 17:53.310
I wish I could just
find it behind my ear.

17:53.311 --> 17:55.262
I'd rather be that stupid than
think that anyone of us

17:55.263 --> 17:57.185
might be this inconsiderate.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.317
After all we've been through,
it almost seems impossible.

18:02.404 --> 18:06.085
It seems less than impossible.

18:06.903 --> 18:08.761
Something impossible

18:09.228 --> 18:11.014
actual seems more likely.

18:11.639 --> 18:12.732
Here we go.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.290
Winger speech to take us home.

18:14.711 --> 18:16.088
What if a ghost took the pen?

18:16.089 --> 18:17.838
- Let him finish
- I am finished.

18:17.908 --> 18:20.571
For real, honestly,
seriously, why not?

18:20.572 --> 18:22.810
Why not just "a ghost took the pen"?

18:22.811 --> 18:25.429
Okay, I've been
saying that for hours.

18:25.430 --> 18:27.676
And we should've listening
to Troy from the beginning.

18:27.681 --> 18:29.392
Guys, look in your hearts

18:29.393 --> 18:31.365
and answer this question honestly:

18:31.366 --> 18:32.875
What's more likely?

18:32.997 --> 18:35.818
That someone in this group
doesn't belong in this group?

18:35.819 --> 18:37.473
Or ghosts?

18:37.474 --> 18:39.664
If we have to choose between
turning on each other

18:39.665 --> 18:41.659
or pinning it on some specter

18:41.660 --> 18:43.765
with unfinished,
pen-related business,

18:43.766 --> 18:46.577
I'm sorry,
but my money's on ghost.

18:47.871 --> 18:50.126
Well, I'm not a
religious person,

18:50.127 --> 18:52.256
but I've seen specials
on the paranormal.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.513
Anything's possible.

18:53.514 --> 18:55.343
Relative to the alternative,

18:55.742 --> 18:58.381
it actually seems
more logical to me.

18:58.382 --> 19:00.861
Why would a ghost want a pen?

19:05.016 --> 19:05.982
Troy?

19:07.703 --> 19:08.661
Okay.

19:08.967 --> 19:12.010
So I see it as a lot like the
movie paranormal activity,

19:12.143 --> 19:15.148
except for more boring and fancy.

19:15.216 --> 19:17.728
And I think in 1856,

19:17.729 --> 19:19.923
it is possible that
a man was beheaded

19:19.924 --> 19:21.414
while he was writing in his diary

19:21.415 --> 19:23.448
to his long lost love,

19:23.543 --> 19:25.552
and now he roams the
halls of Greendale

19:25.553 --> 19:27.969
screaming for his pen so he
can write her a love letter.

19:27.970 --> 19:30.643
"I need her! I need her!" 
he screams,

19:30.644 --> 19:32.356
as he looked for a pen.

19:42.332 --> 19:44.777
What the hell did you
people do in there?

19:46.456 --> 19:48.420
Something you and your puppies
could only dream of

19:48.421 --> 19:50.156
you non-miraculous son of a bitch.

19:52.387 --> 19:53.794
Non-miraculous?

19:54.257 --> 19:56.293
Wait! Abed!
