WEBVTT

00:02.373 --> 00:03.574
(sighs)

00:04.705 --> 00:06.507
THANKS FOR MEETING ME HERE.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.008
HEY, I GET IT.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.210
YOU DON'T WANT ME
COMING BY YOUR PLACE

00:09.210 --> 00:10.581
WHEN YOU ROOMMATES ARE THERE.

00:10.581 --> 00:12.613
WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO THINK
YOU HAVE A MOTHER.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.717
GOT THE LAUNDRY.

00:18.049 --> 00:20.691
IT'S ALL THERE. NOW PAY UP.

00:20.691 --> 00:22.623
ALL RIGHT. (grunts) HERE.

00:24.455 --> 00:26.157
WHOA.

00:26.157 --> 00:28.359
YOU TRYING TO PUNK ME, BOY?

00:29.560 --> 00:31.532
GIVE ME THE REST.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.733
I LOVE YOU, MOM.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.166
THERE'S THE STUFF.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.568
OH!
(grunts)

00:37.568 --> 00:39.270
(strained voice)
ALL RIGHT, STOP. STOP.

00:39.270 --> 00:41.041
NO. I DON'T WANT TO STOP.

00:41.041 --> 00:46.046
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:46.046 --> 00:47.648
HEY, JULES.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.081
CAN'T TALK, TOM.
IT'S OUR WEEKLY FAMILY NIGHT.

00:50.081 --> 00:51.822
YOU'VE GOT UNTIL
THE SHADE CLOSES.

00:51.822 --> 00:53.524
OH, UH, SO I'M LEAVING FOR
A SWEET VAY-CAY IN CANCUN.

00:53.524 --> 00:55.286
GOT A-A KILLER DEAL ON A...

00:55.286 --> 00:57.488
CAN ONE OF YOU FEED MY CAT?
GOT IT.

00:57.488 --> 01:01.162
OKAY, WHO'S IN CHARGE OF FEEDING
TOM'S STUPID CAT? NOT IT!

01:01.162 --> 01:02.533
(Grayson and Bobby) NOT IT!
NOPE!

01:02.533 --> 01:04.465
LOOKS LIKE TRAVIS' DATE'S
ON CAT DUTY.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.297
I DON'T LIVE IN THE AREA.

01:06.297 --> 01:08.639
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A YOU PROBLEM.
(both chuckle)

01:08.639 --> 01:10.271
SO TONIGHT WE'RE WATCHING
"GAME OF THRONES,"

01:10.271 --> 01:12.603
BECAUSE I WANNA STAY ON TOP
OF TRENDY THINGS.

01:12.603 --> 01:15.506
NEXT WEEK, WE'RE GOING TO
WATCH, READ, OR PLAY

01:15.506 --> 01:16.747
SOMETHING CALLED
"THE HUNGRY GAMES"?

01:16.747 --> 01:18.549
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

01:18.549 --> 01:21.081
ADMITTEDLY, "GAME OF THRONES"
GIVES ME A GIANT NERDGASM,

01:21.081 --> 01:23.484
BUT I GOTTA WARN YOU GUYS,
IT'S A LITTLE RACY.
(music playing)

01:23.484 --> 01:25.085
OH, TRAV, WE'RE ADULTS.
WE CAN HANDLE--

01:25.085 --> 01:27.158
OH, WOW! BOOBS ALREADY.

01:27.158 --> 01:28.689
WHOO! SHE IS PRETTY.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.722
I PICKED A BAD NIGHT
TO GO COMMANDO. (laughs)
(laughs)

01:31.722 --> 01:33.124
AT LEAST I'M NOT ON
A FIRST DATE.

01:33.124 --> 01:34.725
OH, WAIT. YES, I AM.

01:34.725 --> 01:36.467
DO HER NIPPLES LOOK LIKE MINE?

01:36.467 --> 01:38.699
NO.
YEP.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.672
WELL, I GOT A HOLD OF 'EM
BEFORE TRAV DID.

01:41.672 --> 01:43.134
LUCKY.

01:43.134 --> 01:44.705
I KNOW.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.338
THEY USED TO NOT BE
NEARLY AS LONG. (mouths word)

01:47.338 --> 01:49.380
MAYBE NOBODY TALK FOR A WHILE.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.612
OH, BOY.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.214
DO YOU WANNA PLAY A LITTLE GAME

01:53.214 --> 01:55.746
I LIKE TO CALL
"THINGS THAT ANNOY ELLIE"?

01:55.746 --> 01:57.688
OOH!
OOH!

01:57.688 --> 01:59.620
VEGANS.
FEDORAS.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.392
RAINBOWS.
THE WNBA.

02:01.392 --> 02:03.224
OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN.
BUTTERFLIES.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.755
STREET FESTS.
TALKING.

02:04.755 --> 02:06.627
OH, THIS COULD GO ON
FOR 6,000 YEARS.

02:06.627 --> 02:10.231
I WAS THINKING MORE ABOUT THINGS
THAT ANNOY ME IN THIS ROOM.

02:10.231 --> 02:13.404
THERE'S THE HORSE DOG
ON MY COUCH LICKING HIS JUNK.

02:13.404 --> 02:16.367
(chuckles) I LOVE A DOG WHO
KEEPS A CLEAN BISCUIT BASKET.

02:16.367 --> 02:18.369
DOG TRAV, BEER ME.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.612
STILL, THE WORST THING

02:21.612 --> 02:25.176
IS THAT YOU JUST LEAVE
YOUR TINY, WIDE SOCKS

02:25.176 --> 02:28.779
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.
PICK THEM UP.

02:28.779 --> 02:30.821
MNH.

02:30.821 --> 02:32.653
YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL AT ANDY
ALL THE TIME

02:32.653 --> 02:34.285
TO GET WHAT YOU WANT.

02:34.285 --> 02:36.927
PLEASE TELL ME MORE
ABOUT MAKING A MARRIAGE WORK.

02:36.927 --> 02:39.260
DOG TRAVIS USED TO BE
LIKE ANDO--

02:39.260 --> 02:42.793
I'D YELL, AND HE'D DO STUFF
BUT HE'D RESENT ME.

02:42.793 --> 02:47.167
I STOPPED YELLING AND STARTED
GIVING HIM TREATS.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.570
GOOD BOY!

02:49.570 --> 02:51.942
WHERE DID HE GET?
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE BEER.

02:51.942 --> 02:53.444
(fizzes)
HE'S A BEER HOUND.

02:53.444 --> 02:55.846
HE JUST FINDS
THE CLOSEST ONE.

02:55.846 --> 02:57.678
(panting)

02:57.678 --> 03:00.411
LIGHT BEER?

03:00.411 --> 03:04.184
(groans) MESSAGE RECEIVED.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.788
FAMILY NIGHT WAS A DISASTER.
WE RAN OUT OF POPCORN.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.591
OH, AND I MADE MY SON
AND HIS DATE WATCH PORN.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.423
DID YOU GUYS KNOW

03:12.423 --> 03:14.425
THAT "PORNOGRAPHY"
IS NAMED AFTER

03:14.425 --> 03:16.597
THE INSTRUMENT USED
TO MEASURE AROUSAL?

03:16.597 --> 03:17.898
THE PORNOGRAPH.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.400
OH.
FACT.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.601
NOT A FACT.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.802
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO TRAVIS.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.874
WAIT! FIRST, UH,
CHECK OUT THE TRUTH.

03:23.874 --> 03:26.437
FRESHLY WAXED. (chuckles)

03:26.437 --> 03:30.681
OOH. IT'S LIKE A BRAND-NEW
SLIGHTLY GAY FERRARI.

03:30.681 --> 03:33.314
OH, I WISH YOU WOULDN'T CALL
MY BEAUTY REGIMEN "GAY."

03:33.314 --> 03:35.746
(chuckles) AND I WISH YOU
WOULDN'T SAY "BEAUTY REGIMEN."

03:35.746 --> 03:37.288
WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE?

03:37.288 --> 03:38.489
SWEETIE,
YOU KNOW GRAYSON'S ALWAYS BEEN

03:38.489 --> 03:40.891
A LITTLE BIT HOMOPHOBIC.
FACT.

03:40.891 --> 03:42.693
YOU'RE RIGHT. BYE.
YEAH.

03:42.693 --> 03:44.224
I AM NOT...

03:44.224 --> 03:46.497
(chuckles) JUST BECAUSE
YOU SAY "FACT"

03:46.497 --> 03:48.499
DOESN'T MAKE SOMETHING
A FACT.

03:48.499 --> 03:51.001
(whispers) FACT.

03:51.001 --> 03:53.964
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT FAMILY NIGHT.

03:53.964 --> 03:57.368
I DON'T WANT TO EVER FORCE YOU
TO SPEND TIME WITH ME AGAIN.

03:57.368 --> 03:58.839
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
I WAS DYING,

03:58.839 --> 04:00.711
AND THEN I'D WANT YOU AROUND ME
CONSTANTLY.

04:00.711 --> 04:02.313
BUT I WOULDN'T WANT
TO BURDEN YOU,

04:02.313 --> 04:03.914
SO I WOULDN'T TELL YOU
I WAS DYING.

04:03.914 --> 04:05.916
BUT THEN
WHEN I FINALLY DID DIE...

04:05.916 --> 04:08.849
OH, YOU WOULD BE CRUSHED.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.582
I HOPE WHEN I DIE I GET TO SEE
MY OWN FUNERAL BECAUSE--

04:11.582 --> 04:12.823
MOM, FAMILY NIGHT.

04:12.823 --> 04:15.656
LOOK, YOU'RE AN ADULT NOW.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.789
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SCHEDULE
MANDATORY GET-TOGETHERS.

04:18.789 --> 04:20.861
WE SHOULD HANG OUT
WHENEVER WE WANT, HAVE A DRINK.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.393
YOU KNOW, REALLY CONNECT.

04:22.393 --> 04:24.335
OH, MY GOD.
YOU WANT US TO BE FRIENDS?

04:24.335 --> 04:27.267
FRIENDS THAT CAN TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.839
I WANNA BE
FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.542
I DIDN'T USE THAT RIGHT,
DID I?

04:31.542 --> 04:33.374
I HOPE NOT.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.905
ALL RIGHT, SO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE.

04:34.905 --> 04:37.548
ARE YOU STILL HUNG UP
ON LAURIE?

04:37.548 --> 04:39.380
I STOLE HER RETAINER.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.681
FRIENDS KEEP SECRETS.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.413
(chuckles) CHEERS.
(clink)

04:42.413 --> 04:43.954
OKAY. WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL
YOU BROUGHT TO THE HOUSE?

04:43.954 --> 04:45.356
W-WHAT WAS HER NAME?

04:45.356 --> 04:46.557
I JUST CALL HER NOT-LAURIE.

04:46.557 --> 04:47.758
WELL, NOT TO HER FACE.
NO.

04:47.758 --> 04:48.959
ONCE, BUT...
OH.

04:48.959 --> 04:50.821
IT WAS DARK.
WE WERE MAKING OUT.

04:50.821 --> 04:52.863
THE WEIRD PART IS, FORGETTING
HER NAME MADE HER LIKE ME MORE.

04:52.863 --> 04:54.825
WHY IS IT THE SECOND YOU START
TREATING GIRLS LIKE CRAP,

04:54.825 --> 04:56.427
THEY CAN'T
KEEP THEIR CLOTHES ON?

04:56.427 --> 04:58.569
IF I COULD ANSWER THAT,
YOU MIGHT NOT EXIST.

05:00.931 --> 05:03.904
SERIOUSLY? I HAVE TO SEE
MORE SOCKS ON THE FLOOR?

05:06.907 --> 05:09.309
PROBLEM SOLVED.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.941
HEY, BOO,

05:10.941 --> 05:13.944
IF YOU PICK UP YOUR SOCKS
AND PUT THEM IN THE HAMPER,

05:13.944 --> 05:16.316
I'LL GIVE YOU A KISS
ON THE FOREHEAD.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.519
REALLY?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.591
IS THIS A TRICK?
ARE YOU GONNA HIT ME?

05:20.591 --> 05:21.792
NO.

05:28.599 --> 05:31.001
(whispers)
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

05:31.001 --> 05:32.533
(chuckles)

05:34.365 --> 05:35.936
WHAT A GOOD BOY!

05:37.938 --> 05:39.410
(camera shutter clicks)

05:39.410 --> 05:42.012
YOU GUYS TOTALLY CAPTURED
SELLECK, DANSON,

05:42.012 --> 05:43.874
AND THAT OTHER GUY
NO ONE CAN EVER REMEMBER.

05:43.874 --> 05:45.716
YOU KNOW WHAT'S MISSING?
TOM SELLECK'S MUSTACHE.

05:45.716 --> 05:48.649
OOH! WE SHOULD ALL GROW
ONE OF THOSE GLORIOUS BASTARDS.

05:48.649 --> 05:52.022
OH, YOU ALWAYS HAVE
SUCH HORRIBLE IDEAS.

05:52.022 --> 05:54.084
THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
I'M IN!

05:54.084 --> 05:55.586
YEAH, BABY!
(laughs)

05:55.586 --> 05:57.428
(speaks indistinctly)
(door closes)

05:57.428 --> 06:01.091
HEY, GUYS, WE'RE NOT DOING
MANDATORY FAMILY NIGHTS ANYMORE.

06:01.091 --> 06:02.733
OH, YEAH!
WHOO-HOO!

06:02.733 --> 06:04.595
(Bobby) WHOO!
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE SAD.

06:04.595 --> 06:06.366
(groans)
(groans)

06:06.366 --> 06:07.668
ANYWAY, I JUST HAD

06:07.668 --> 06:10.370
THE MOST AMAZING
GROWN-UP DATE WITH TRAVIS.

06:10.370 --> 06:14.374
OH! WE TALKED FOR HOURS,
AND IT FELT LIKE FIVE MINUTES.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.447
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU
FOR NOT SLEEPING WITH HIM.

06:16.447 --> 06:18.649
HONEST TO GOD,
IT COULD'VE GONE EITHER WAY.

06:18.649 --> 06:21.512
ANYWAY, I TOLD TRAVIS
TO ONLY COME OVER

06:21.512 --> 06:24.985
WHEN HE REALLY WANTS TO SEE ME.

06:24.985 --> 06:28.088
IT'S BEEN NINE DAYS.
WHY DOESN'T HE WANT TO SEE ME?

06:30.060 --> 06:32.593
WHAT ARE YOU IDIOTS DOING?

06:32.593 --> 06:35.596
THIS IS HOW
GUYS WITH MUSTACHES THINK.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.929
MM.
YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO CAN GROW BODY HAIR?

06:38.929 --> 06:41.071
I'VE LET THINGS GO, TOO.
CHECK IT.

06:41.071 --> 06:43.173
(all) OHH!

06:49.610 --> 06:52.513
CHEER UP.
TRAV WILL EVENTUALLY COME BY.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.845
YOU RAISED HIM TO BE
DEPENDENT AND HELPLESS.

06:54.845 --> 06:56.416
THANKS, BABE.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.148
I KNEW YOU'D TAKE THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.623
MMM.
MMM.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.555
(door closes)
BYE.

07:04.555 --> 07:05.896
(gasps)
(gasps)

07:05.896 --> 07:07.127
GOD!

07:07.127 --> 07:08.929
STUPID 'STACHE RASH.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.961
(door closes)
MY WHOLE BODY IS RED
FROM THAT DAMN THING.

07:10.961 --> 07:13.634
OH, TO HELL WITH IT.
I'M JUST GONNA CALL TRAV.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.435
I HAVE TO.
I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.637
(high-pitched voice) HUH?

07:16.637 --> 07:17.968
I MEAN, I LOVE HIM.

07:17.968 --> 07:19.740
WELL, THEY'RE THE SAME,
RIGHT?

07:19.740 --> 07:22.843
WHAT IS THIS,
AMATEUR NIGHT AT CLUB DESPERATE?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.675
YOU ARE NOT CALLING HIM.

07:26.517 --> 07:27.978
(Dog Travis grunts)

07:27.978 --> 07:29.550
(bottles clink)

07:34.785 --> 07:36.587
(whines)

07:36.587 --> 07:39.530
NICE JOB, DOG TRAV! AHH.

07:39.530 --> 07:41.892
WHY IS MINE CLUB SODA?

07:41.892 --> 07:43.764
D.T. DESIGNATED YOU MY DRIVER.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.766
(fizzes)

07:45.766 --> 07:47.568
HEY.

07:47.568 --> 07:50.040
ANDY, GO GRAB MY SLIPPERS.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.904
OH. (baby talk)
WHAT A GOOD BOY!

07:53.904 --> 07:55.806
YOU WERE RIGHT!

07:55.806 --> 07:59.810
A FEW TREATS, SOME "GOOD BOYS,"
I CAN GET ANDY TO DO ANYTHING.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.212
HE ONLY USES
THE DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM NOW.

08:02.212 --> 08:03.954
WE CALL IT HIS PEE SPOT.

08:03.954 --> 08:05.485
I JUST MEANT
BE NICER TO HIM...

08:06.817 --> 08:08.519
(whispers)
NOT TREAT HIM LIKE A DOG.

08:08.519 --> 08:09.960
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD
OF YOURSELF.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.662
YOU HAVEN'T HAD
A GOOD IDEA SINCE...

08:11.662 --> 08:12.863
EVER.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.796
THANK YOU.
(clatters)

08:15.796 --> 08:18.569
THANKS, BOO.
YOU WANT SOME PEANUT BUTTER?

08:18.569 --> 08:23.574
(baby talk) OH, THAT'S GOOD.
IS THAT GOOD?

08:23.574 --> 08:26.236
(whispers) THAT'S HOW I GET HIM
TO TAKE HIS VITAMIN.

08:26.236 --> 08:28.238
(sighs)

08:28.238 --> 08:31.181
HOW AWESOME
IS THIS MUSTACHE?

08:33.243 --> 08:34.685
(imitates Sam Elliott
as The Stranger) I REMEMBER

08:34.685 --> 08:36.547
THE FIRST TIME
I MET THE DUDE.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.721
MM-HMM.

08:40.721 --> 08:46.256
AW! IT'S SO SWEET TO SEE YOU GET
CRUISED IN YOUR COWBOY HAT.

08:46.256 --> 08:48.198
NO, THAT GUY'S NOT GAY.

08:48.198 --> 08:51.231
NODDING IS JUST HOW
MUSTACHE BUDDIES SAY "HELLO."

08:51.231 --> 08:54.104
NO, IT'S HOW
GAY MUSTACHE BUDDIES SAY,

08:54.104 --> 08:55.806
"MEET ME
IN THE HANDICAP STALL

08:55.806 --> 08:59.870
SO WE CAN DISCUSS
CHANNING'S TATUMS."

08:59.870 --> 09:02.012
WELL, MAYBE IT'S NOT
THE 'STACHE. MAYBE IT'S THE HAT.

09:02.012 --> 09:03.213
в™Єв™Єв™Є

09:03.213 --> 09:05.015
(clicks tongue) NO.

09:05.015 --> 09:06.947
EVEN WITHOUT THE LID, YOUR PULSE
IS STILL GIVING ME A REAL...

09:06.947 --> 09:09.019
(hums techno beat)

09:09.019 --> 09:11.321
FINE.
I GUESS I'LL SHAVE IT.

09:11.321 --> 09:13.854
BUT YOU LOVE
YOUR FANNY DUSTER.

09:13.854 --> 09:16.026
NOW... IF YOU'RE NOT

09:16.026 --> 09:19.590
JUST A TEENSY BIT
HOMOPHOBIC,

09:19.590 --> 09:21.732
WHY WOULD YOU HAVE TO
SHAVE IT?

09:21.732 --> 09:23.163
DAMN IT.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.766
EXCUSE ME.
I FEEL LIKE DANCING.

09:25.766 --> 09:29.269
(hums techno beat)

09:29.269 --> 09:31.602
OH, MY GOD.

09:31.602 --> 09:33.003
(door closes)
I WANNA CALL TRAVIS SO BAD.

09:33.003 --> 09:34.875
HERE. TAKE MY PHONE.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.206
THAT'S A CALCULATOR.

09:36.206 --> 09:37.848
WELL, I CAN'T GIVE YOU
MY REAL PHONE.

09:37.848 --> 09:39.279
TRAVIS MIGHT CALL.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.812
LEAVE HIM BE.
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

09:41.812 --> 09:44.314
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY KID
SINCE...

09:44.314 --> 09:46.186
OOH, BATH TIME YESTERDAY.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.358
I JUST HATE NOT KNOWING
WHERE HE IS.

09:48.358 --> 09:51.321
I MEAN, HE COULD BE AT THE GYM.
HE COULD BE DEAD IN A DITCH.

09:51.321 --> 09:53.794
YES, I KNOW
HE'S NOT AT THE GYM.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.196
SCREW IT. I'M CALLING HIM.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.028
JULES, DON'T.
YOU'LL REGRET IT.

09:58.028 --> 10:00.070
GIRL, PLEASE. I'LL BE SMOOTH.

10:00.070 --> 10:01.632
OH, REALLY?

10:01.632 --> 10:03.734
(cell phone rings, beep)

10:03.734 --> 10:04.935
HELLO.

10:04.935 --> 10:06.336
TRAV?

10:06.336 --> 10:09.039
(chuckles) WEIRD!
I MUST'VE BUTT-DIALED YOU.

10:09.039 --> 10:10.941
FROM THE TORRES' HOME PHONE?

10:10.941 --> 10:13.283
I KNOW. THAT'S CRAZY.

10:13.283 --> 10:15.786
SO... WHAT UP?

10:15.786 --> 10:18.649
I'M ACTUALLY SUPER BUSY
RIGHT NOW, SO... (blows air)

10:18.649 --> 10:20.821
WELL, I AM
TOTALLY SLAMMED, TOO.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.953
OKAY, WELL,
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. BYE.

10:22.953 --> 10:24.695
LOVE YOU.
(line disconnects, dial tone)

10:25.956 --> 10:27.327
HOW'D THAT FEEL?

10:27.327 --> 10:29.860
(beep)

10:31.962 --> 10:34.364
FEELS LIKE WE HAVE
A BIGGER GAY CROWD THAN USUAL.

10:34.364 --> 10:38.338
I MAYBE TWEETED THE GLARMY--
THAT'S THE GAY LARMY--

10:38.338 --> 10:40.841
AND TOLD THEM THERE WAS
A REAL RAINBOW-FRIENDLY BAR

10:40.841 --> 10:42.943
WITH A HOT 'STACHED OWNER

10:42.943 --> 10:46.046
WHO LURVES HIMSELF
SOME KATHY GRIFFIN.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.719
SHE'S KNOWS SHE'S NOT "A" LIST
BUT SHE JUST ROLLS WITH IT.

10:48.719 --> 10:51.651
ALSO, I FIXED YOUR SIGN.

10:55.986 --> 10:58.388
IT'S CATCHY.
DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

11:01.131 --> 11:02.863
WOW.

11:02.863 --> 11:06.366
FELT LIKE A $5.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.998
ANDY.
HMM?

11:07.998 --> 11:09.399
WE'VE GOTTA GO.

11:09.399 --> 11:11.141
I JUST SAW
STAN'S KINDERGARTEN TEACHER

11:11.141 --> 11:13.804
DOING SOMETHING
HIS WIFE SHOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT.

11:13.804 --> 11:16.947
(chair scrapes floor)

11:16.947 --> 11:18.278
BACK OFF. HE'S TAKEN.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.750
в™Єв™Єв™Є

11:19.750 --> 11:21.681
ANDY, LET'S GO.
(clicks tongue)

11:21.681 --> 11:23.413
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
FOLLOW HER.

11:23.413 --> 11:25.115
SURE I DO. SHE CLICKED.

11:25.115 --> 11:26.757
DON'T YOU SEE
WHAT SHE'S DOIN'?

11:26.757 --> 11:29.059
STAY.

11:29.059 --> 11:30.891
HEY, CORN BREAD,

11:30.891 --> 11:33.063
PLEASE DO NOT RUIN THIS THING
I'VE GOT GOING WITH ANDY,

11:33.063 --> 11:35.295
OR I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A VASECTOMY WITH THAT FORK.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.728
в™Єв™Єв™Є

11:37.728 --> 11:39.169
(grunts)

11:39.169 --> 11:42.833
ANDREW, ALL THE TREATS
AND ALL THE "GOOD BOYS!"--

11:42.833 --> 11:45.435
SHE'S TRAINING YOU THE SAME WAY
I TRAINED DOG TRAVIS.

11:45.435 --> 11:48.708
SHE'D NEVER DO THAT, RIGHT?
EH.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.711
I'M NOT AN ANIMAL!
I'M A MAN, DAMN IT!

11:55.185 --> 11:58.188
(sloshing)

12:06.897 --> 12:09.259
HEY.
YOU SUNNING YOUR 'STACHE?

12:09.259 --> 12:11.731
I LIKE TO KEEP
THE TICKLER GOLDEN.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.834
D.T., FETCH THE LADY
A DRINK.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.106
(whines)

12:18.038 --> 12:20.470
UH-OH.

12:20.470 --> 12:23.743
I KNOW THAT LOOK. YOU'RE
OBSESSING ABOUT SOMETHING.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.145
THIS SUCKS.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.147
OUR KID BECAME AN ADULT.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.050
I KNEW HE'D HAVE
HIS OWN LIFE,

12:30.050 --> 12:31.521
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
HE'D LEAVE US BEHIND.

12:31.521 --> 12:33.083
I MEAN, DO YOU FEEL LIKE

12:33.083 --> 12:35.085
HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT
TO SEE YOU ANYMORE?

12:35.085 --> 12:37.427
NOT REALLY.
HEY, MOM.

12:37.427 --> 12:39.860
SO IT'S NOT THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOUR PARENTS.

12:39.860 --> 12:43.964
RIGHT? IT'S THAT YOU DON'T
WANT TO SEE ME.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.365
MOM.

12:52.402 --> 12:54.374
HOLA, GUYS.
HEY, THANKS FOR FEEDING MY CAT.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.106
OH, RIGHT.

12:56.106 --> 12:58.248
YOUR CAT, THAT YOU HAVE,

12:58.248 --> 12:59.980
WHICH WE FED.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.552
SNOWBALL'S BEEN ACTING WEIRD
EVER SINCE I GOT BACK.

13:02.552 --> 13:06.286
YOU KNOW, COLD AND DISTANT,
ALMOST PRIMITIVE.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.088
ANYWAY,
THANKS FOR FEEDING HER.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.990
MM-HMM.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.293
THAT EXPLAINS ALL THE DEAD
SQUIRRELS IN THE BACKYARD.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.165
I STARVED HIS CAT.

13:15.165 --> 13:17.267
I DIDN'T THINK I COULD FEEL
ANY WORSE.

13:17.267 --> 13:21.231
SWEETIE, I KNOW HOW REJECTION
CAN BE SO PAINFUL.

13:21.231 --> 13:22.973
I MEAN, LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW PERSONALLY,

13:22.973 --> 13:25.135
BUT I'VE HEARD ABOUT IT
FROM GIRLS WITH SMALL BOOBS.

13:25.135 --> 13:27.477
ALL KIDS PULL AWAY
FROM THEIR FOLKS.

13:27.477 --> 13:29.179
WHEN TRAV WAS LITTLE,
HE RAN AWAY,

13:29.179 --> 13:31.811
ENDED UP IN KEY LARGO,
AND TO GET HIM BACK,

13:31.811 --> 13:36.016
I HAD TO TRADE MY SOUL WITH
THAT HAITIAN SHAMAN. REMEMBER?
(door opens)

13:36.016 --> 13:38.218
NOPE.
FIRST I'M HEARING OF IT.
(door closes)

13:39.289 --> 13:41.051
(sighs deeply)

13:41.051 --> 13:43.193
(sighs deeply)

13:43.193 --> 13:45.825
(groans)

13:45.825 --> 13:47.057
(groans)

13:47.057 --> 13:48.428
UGH.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.430
UGH! STOP!

13:50.430 --> 13:52.602
NOW THIS IS MY SAD.
NO PIGGYBACKING!

13:52.602 --> 13:54.404
HEY, I'M SAD, TOO.
MY WIFE TREATS ME LIKE A DOG.

13:54.404 --> 13:56.206
AND AS A MAN--
SNORE!

13:56.206 --> 13:58.068
MY SAD IS SADDER, RIGHT?

13:58.068 --> 13:59.309
MUCH SADDER.

13:59.309 --> 14:01.471
(mouths words)
(mouths words)

14:01.471 --> 14:03.073
LOOK, THE TWO OF YOU ARE

14:03.073 --> 14:04.474
BOTH MAD AT PEOPLE YOU LOVE,
ALL RIGHT.

14:04.474 --> 14:06.216
THIS IS ALL GONNA BLOW OVER.

14:06.216 --> 14:08.218
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
YEAH.

14:08.218 --> 14:10.620
ZOOEY DESCHA-HELL, NO!

14:10.620 --> 14:13.083
WHAT YOU TWO NEED
IS REVENGE.

14:13.083 --> 14:16.326
IF SOMEONE HURTS YOU,
YOU HURT THEM RIGHT BACK.

14:16.326 --> 14:17.527
YEAH, REVENGE IS BETTER.

14:17.527 --> 14:19.189
I'M IN.
MM.

14:19.189 --> 14:22.092
YEP.
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN SNOWBALL?
SHE GOT OUT.

14:22.092 --> 14:23.293
(Snowball screeching)
OH, GOD!

14:23.293 --> 14:24.494
(Laurie) OH!
SNOWBALL, NO!

14:24.494 --> 14:27.137
(laughing)
(Tom) STOP!

14:27.137 --> 14:29.239
(Travis) LOOK AT THIS.
(laughs) CRAZY!

14:29.239 --> 14:31.471
HEY, TRAV.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.003
MOM.

14:33.003 --> 14:34.374
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.376
I BROUGHT YOUR LAUNDRY.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.509
I WASHED ALL YOUR LITTLE
T-SHIRTS AND YOUR UNDIES.

14:39.509 --> 14:42.512
OH, I USED THE LAVENDER SOAP
'CAUSE I KNOW HOW

14:42.512 --> 14:45.155
YOU LIKE TO SMELL LIKE...
(whispers) A BITCH.
(basket thuds)

14:45.155 --> 14:46.386
I'M OUT.

14:49.119 --> 14:52.392
THAT'S MY FAVORITE THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.925
(snarling)

14:54.925 --> 14:58.668
ARE YOU CHEWING
MY FAVORITE SANDAL?

14:58.668 --> 15:00.370
(thud)
IT'S A LITTLE GROSS AT FIRST.

15:00.370 --> 15:02.232
IT JUST TASTES LIKE JERKY.

15:02.232 --> 15:04.174
I'M SO STUPID.

15:04.174 --> 15:06.236
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

15:06.236 --> 15:08.478
YOU KNOW I FIND IT CONFUSING
WHEN YOU'RE VULNERABLE.

15:08.478 --> 15:11.581
I'M SO SORRY. I...

15:14.144 --> 15:16.046
COME ON!

15:16.046 --> 15:19.149
в™Є CONFIDENT IN MY SEXUALITY в™Є

15:19.149 --> 15:20.991
в™Єв™Єв™Є

15:20.991 --> 15:23.954
в™Є BONGO NUDE LIKE
MATT McCONAUGHEY, HEY, HEY в™Є

15:23.954 --> 15:26.556
HE PLAYS THE SAME DUDE
IN ALL OF HIS MOVIES.

15:26.556 --> 15:28.358
FACT.

15:28.358 --> 15:29.699
McCONAUGH-HATERS GONNA HATE.

15:29.699 --> 15:32.002
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST OWN UP
TO WHO YOU ARE--

15:32.002 --> 15:34.264
A NICE STRAIGHT GUY
WHO'S MAYBE

15:34.264 --> 15:37.037
JUST A TEENSY,
TINESY BIT UNCOMFORTABLE

15:37.037 --> 15:38.708
WITH RIPPED ABS
AND MAN CRACKS?

15:38.708 --> 15:40.570
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.

15:40.570 --> 15:42.542
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S IT.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.674
в™Єв™Єв™Є

15:44.674 --> 15:46.546
(dings)

15:46.546 --> 15:50.520
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
WHY DOES IT MAKE ME A HOMOPHOBE

15:50.520 --> 15:53.123
BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW
I'M STRAIGHT?

15:53.123 --> 15:55.325
I MEAN, YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW
YOU'RE GAY.

15:55.325 --> 15:56.626
I'M NOT GAY.

15:56.626 --> 15:59.129
UH, WELL, THEN YOU, SIR,
ARE A BAD EXAMPLE.

15:59.129 --> 16:02.462
LOOK, I AM FINE
WITH ANYONE'S LIFE CHOICE.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.134
(man) IT'S NOT A CHOICE!

16:04.134 --> 16:06.136
MISTAKE NUMBER TWO.

16:06.136 --> 16:08.368
LOOK, I JUST DON'T WANT
PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME

16:08.368 --> 16:12.302
BECAUSE I LIKE MY MANIS,
MY PEDIS, MY WAXIES...
(dramatic orchestral score)

16:12.302 --> 16:13.673
MY SHIRTS THAT MAKE MY EYES POP,

16:13.673 --> 16:16.076
WHICH ARE, BY THE WAY,
ALL OF THEM. (chuckles)

16:16.076 --> 16:18.608
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LIKE BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS

16:18.608 --> 16:20.680
AND THE REDESIGNED V.W. BUG,

16:20.680 --> 16:22.652
AND BRAD PITT IS A WORK OF ART.

16:22.652 --> 16:24.484
NOBODY CAN DENY THAT.

16:24.484 --> 16:29.189
IT'S TIME TO DROP THE LABELS,
PEOPLE, AND JUST SHARE.

16:29.189 --> 16:32.462
GAY, STRAIGHT--THE BACKHAND SNAP
IS FOR ALL OF US.

16:32.462 --> 16:35.025
IT'S THE PERFECT WAY
TO PUNCTUATE A SENTENCE.

16:35.025 --> 16:38.768
OH! AND, UH, YOU GUYS DON'T
OWN RAINBOWS, OKAY?

16:38.768 --> 16:41.031
WE ALL LOVE REFRACTED LIGHT.

16:41.031 --> 16:42.472
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

16:42.472 --> 16:45.435
SO LET'S ENJOY THESE THINGS
AS BROTHERS.

16:45.435 --> 16:47.077
WHO'S WITH ME?!
(orchestral score swells)

16:47.077 --> 16:48.608
(music stops)

16:48.608 --> 16:51.381
THAT WAS SUPER WEIRD.
(scoffs)

16:51.381 --> 16:54.584
NICE TIZZY, GRAYSON.

16:54.584 --> 16:56.446
I KNEW I COULD UNRAVEL YOU.

16:56.446 --> 16:59.119
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD?
SAY IT.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.750
FACT.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.053
GIRL, YOU WORK MY NERVES.

17:08.658 --> 17:10.660
THOUGHT I MIGHT
FIND YOU HERE.

17:10.660 --> 17:13.563
THIS IS WHERE WE HAD
OUR FIRST DATE.

17:13.563 --> 17:16.206
IT WENT SO WELL,
I THOUGHT IT WOULD LEAD TO MORE.

17:16.206 --> 17:17.637
MORE WHAT?

17:17.637 --> 17:21.741
THIS IS MY FAULT. LOOK, I LOVE
HANGING OUT WITH YOU.

17:21.741 --> 17:25.475
IT'S JUST SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER
TO HANG OUT WITH DAD.

17:25.475 --> 17:27.347
YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T
MAKE ME TALK.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.779
ALL WE DO IS SIT AND WATCH TV
AND FART IN THE FART JAR.

17:29.779 --> 17:32.222
AND, YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
IT SOUNDS LIKE.

17:32.222 --> 17:34.684
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.
I GOT A COUPLE IN THERE.

17:34.684 --> 17:37.687
SOLID MOTHER-SON MOMENT.

17:37.687 --> 17:40.130
BUT IT'S JUST THAT
WHEN I'M WITH YOU,

17:40.130 --> 17:42.432
YOU MAKE ME TALK ABOUT
REAL STUFF.

17:42.432 --> 17:44.464
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LIKE,

17:44.464 --> 17:47.367
"ARE YOU OVER LAURIE?
WHO'S THE NEW GIRL AT SCHOOL?"

17:47.367 --> 17:50.300
I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT
NANA RUTHIE.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.541
I REMEMBER SHE WOULD CALL,

17:51.541 --> 17:53.403
AND YOU NEVER WANTED
TO TALK TO HER.

17:53.403 --> 17:55.345
YOU WERE ALWAYS LIKE...
(groans)

17:55.345 --> 17:58.448
I JUST DON'T WANNA EVER
BE NANA RUTHIE TO YOU.

17:58.448 --> 18:00.380
WELL, THAT'LL NEVER HAPPEN

18:00.380 --> 18:03.553
'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
A RACIST DOLL COLLECTION.

18:03.553 --> 18:04.854
OR A RACIST PLATE COLLECTION

18:04.854 --> 18:06.386
OR A RACIST SALTSHAKER
COLLECTION.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.588
YEAH, SHE WAS A REAL--
RACIST?

18:08.588 --> 18:09.789
WELL, I WAS GONNA SAY
"COLLECTOR,"

18:09.789 --> 18:11.621
BUT SHE WAS PROBABLY BOTH.

18:13.723 --> 18:18.198
SEE, THE WHOLE POINT
OF HAVING A CHILD

18:18.198 --> 18:19.699
IS TO LOVE IT...

18:19.699 --> 18:21.831
(voice breaking)
AND TO NURTURE IT

18:21.831 --> 18:24.404
AND TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:24.404 --> 18:28.208
AND EVENTUALLY,
IF YOU'VE DONE YOUR JOB RIGHT,

18:28.208 --> 18:30.280
THE CHILD DOESN'T NEED YOU
ANYMORE.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.142
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:32.142 --> 18:33.883
IT MAKES ME HAPPY.

18:33.883 --> 18:35.715
YOU DON'T SOUND HAPPY.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.548
(chuckles) WELL, I AM.

18:38.548 --> 18:40.490
I PROMISE.

18:40.490 --> 18:41.851
(Michael Franti & Spearhead's
"Have a Little Faith" playing)

18:41.851 --> 18:44.624
в™Є WHEN YOU'RE DOWN в™Є

18:44.624 --> 18:48.828
в™Є AND THE BAD TIMES SEEM
TO FOLLOW YOU AROUND в™Є

18:48.828 --> 18:51.661
OKAY, IF YOU'RE GONNA ACT
INSECURE AND SAD,

18:51.661 --> 18:54.664
THEN I-I DON'T KNOW WHO THE HELL
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE.

18:54.664 --> 18:56.266
в™Є DON'T LET IT GO в™Є

18:56.266 --> 18:58.608
YOU KNOW HOW I YELL AT YOU
AND NAG YOU SOMETIMES?

18:58.608 --> 19:01.171
I'M AWARE
OF THAT BEHAVIOR, YES.

19:01.171 --> 19:03.773
I KNOW THE DOG THING
WAS STUPID.

19:03.773 --> 19:07.247
I JUST KNOW ME,
AND I-I WANT WHAT I WANT,

19:07.247 --> 19:10.550
AND I GUESS I FELT EXCITED
TO FIND A WAY TO GET IT FROM YOU

19:10.550 --> 19:12.522
AND STILL BE NICE.

19:12.522 --> 19:16.626
OKAY, OTHER PEOPLE MAY SEE YOU
AS A TERRIFYING HATE GOBLIN.

19:16.626 --> 19:18.928
NOT DONE. NOT DONE.
NOT DONE. NOT DONE.

19:18.928 --> 19:20.660
BUT THEY DON'T MATTER.

19:20.660 --> 19:24.864
I SEE MY--MY FIERY, HILARIOUS,
BEAUTIFUL WIFE

19:24.864 --> 19:29.369
WHO I KNOW
LOVES ME MORE THAN ANYTHING.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.570
в™Є I'LL BE STRONG FOR YOU в™Є

19:30.570 --> 19:32.502
I REALLY DO, YOU KNOW.

19:32.502 --> 19:34.244
DO YOU WANT
TO SAY IT OUT LOUD?

19:34.244 --> 19:35.545
I DO NOT.

19:35.545 --> 19:36.946
в™Є JUST BE STRONG в™Є

19:36.946 --> 19:39.479
NO! YOU HAVE GOT TO SHAVE
THAT THING.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.951
IT FEELS LIKE I'M EATING
WILLIE NELSON.

19:41.951 --> 19:44.954
THERE'S MY GIRL.

19:44.954 --> 19:46.416
в™Є DON'T LET IT GO в™Є

19:46.416 --> 19:48.818
GOOD.
DIDN'T MISS FAMILY NIGHT.

19:48.818 --> 19:51.591
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT
ANYMORE.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.792
I KNOW.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.624
в™Є DON'T LET IT GO в™Є

19:54.624 --> 19:55.825
SCOOTCH.

19:55.825 --> 19:57.697
в™Є DON'T LET IT GO в™Є

19:57.697 --> 19:59.969
AHH. OOH! "GAME OF THRONES."

19:59.969 --> 20:01.371
YEP.

20:01.371 --> 20:02.702
YOU KNOW,
I ALMOST FIGURED OUT

20:02.702 --> 20:04.804
WHICH ONE OF THOSE DUDES
IS FROM THE FUTURE.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.205
THE REDHEADED--
NONE OF THEM.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.977
NONE OF THEM? MM.

20:07.977 --> 20:10.310
в™Є OH в™Є

20:10.310 --> 20:13.943
в™Є DON'T LET IT GO в™Є
(whistling)

20:13.943 --> 20:15.445
(giggles)

20:15.445 --> 20:17.987
THIS SHOW HAS
SO MUCH BUTT SEX.

20:23.953 --> 20:25.395
HEY, TOM, WE WERE WONDERING
IF WE COULD BORROW

20:25.395 --> 20:26.756
THREE OR FOUR BOTTLES
OF WINE.

20:26.756 --> 20:29.359
OH. WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FACE?

20:29.359 --> 20:31.361
UH, NOTHING.
I, UH, RAN INTO A DOOR.

20:31.361 --> 20:32.802
(chuckles nervously)
ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

20:32.802 --> 20:34.834
DID SNOWBALL DO THIS
TO YOU?

20:34.834 --> 20:37.667
SHE'S BEEN, UH, REALLY STRESSED
LATELY. AND, UH...

20:37.667 --> 20:38.908
(Snowball screeches)

20:38.908 --> 20:41.271
(whispers) YOU SHOULD GO.

20:41.271 --> 20:42.842
AW! HEY.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.844
UH, IT--IT'S OKAY, BABY.
(gasps)

20:44.844 --> 20:47.277
SHE WAS JUST...
ASKING DIRECTIONS.

20:47.277 --> 20:49.979
(meows)

20:49.979 --> 20:51.721
(whispers) I-I-I'M REALLY GONNA
GET IT THIS TIME.

20:51.721 --> 20:53.683
W--

20:53.683 --> 20:56.326
(Snowball screeching)
(Tom) AAH! SNOWBALL, NO!

20:56.326 --> 20:58.658
BAD CAT! PLEASE, STOP!

20:58.658 --> 21:00.390
THAT GUY IS SO WEIRD.

21:00.390 --> 21:01.991
(Snowball screeches)
