01:30.048 --> 01:31.549
God damn it. Where are you?

01:31.633 --> 01:33.510
I've sent you four texts, no, five.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.011
You can't text me back?

01:35.261 --> 01:36.262
Call me.

I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to get angry.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.155
Jeffrey, this is Jamal's mother.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.073
It's, uh... Tuesday--

02:37.157 --> 02:39.742
No, Wednesday night... m-morning. Um...

02:39.826 --> 02:40.952
[sighs]

02:42.036 --> 02:43.371
I'm looking for Jamal.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.748
He hasn't come home, and I...

02:45.832 --> 02:47.417
I thought he might be with you.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.254
I-I'm sorry to bother you,
or, you know, call so early, but...

02:51.337 --> 02:52.297
[door clicks]

02:52.380 --> 02:56.050
If you get this message and he's with you,
can you please have him call me?

02:56.134 --> 02:58.011
-My number is 305--
-[door slams]

02:58.094 --> 03:00.555
Well, it's on your--
Oh, God, okay, hold on.

03:00.638 --> 03:06.102
Just in case, no, um, 305-468-5900.

03:07.687 --> 03:08.605
Okay.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.356
-Sorry.
-So I checked,

03:10.815 --> 03:12.650
like you asked,
and the car does show up.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.527
-Yeah.
-It shows up in the system.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.571
-Shows--
-That's all we really know right now.

03:17.113 --> 03:20.116
-Show-- Shows up how?
-It just shows up, as, you know.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.538
What's-- How does it end up coming
to the attention of, you know...

03:25.622 --> 03:28.249
Oh, it just was logged in, you know,
from an incident.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.293
It could've been ticketed,
could've been towed...

03:30.376 --> 03:32.754
But Jamal, my son, he was driving it,
and he--

03:32.837 --> 03:35.298
I thought you told me you weren't
sure whether or not he was...

03:35.381 --> 03:36.466
Well, yeah. Yes. Okay,

03:36.549 --> 03:38.259
yeah, I didn't see him drive away in it.

03:38.343 --> 03:41.512
I did not actually see him get
in the car. Correct.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.765
But the car's not in our driveway.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.892
He's been gone
since eight o'clock last night.

03:45.975 --> 03:48.269
Going on eight-- I mean, nine hours.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.021
-He's usually home at midnight.
-Right.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.481
He never came home.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.608
And when I called the police,

03:53.691 --> 03:55.777
they said something happened
to the car and--

03:55.860 --> 03:57.528
I thought you told me they said it was--

03:57.612 --> 03:58.905
Hold on. I wrote it down.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.574
[officer sighs]

04:04.327 --> 04:07.497
Okay, um, "An incident."
[stammering] I, um--

04:07.580 --> 04:09.916
That's what she said, an incident.
"Identified in an incident."

04:09.999 --> 04:12.877
Yes. I understand.
And, listen, I'm really very sorr--

04:12.961 --> 04:14.462
I'm sure that he's gonna turn up.

04:14.545 --> 04:18.382
And you've already told me that you're not
the registered owner of the vehicle.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.466
So, I-I mean...

04:19.550 --> 04:21.719
I told you I would verify
the vehicle information anyway.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.805
And I did that, okay?

04:25.890 --> 04:27.183
He has work.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.478
-Sorry?
-Well, an internship.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.189
Jamal, he has a very prestigious...

04:34.315 --> 04:36.192
He has some place to be this morning.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.694
-Sure.
-This isn't like him.

04:37.777 --> 04:38.611
-Ma'am--
-Look,

04:38.695 --> 04:41.197
can't you do a missing persons report
or something?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.991
Not for 48 hours, no.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.451
-Or if there's evidence of, you know--
-Foul play.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.870
We don't really use that term.
That's the movies.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.289
Okay. Something bad. Whatever.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.207
-Right.
-He hasn't come home.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.668
[sighs]

04:55.211 --> 04:57.463
He's a responsible kid.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.799
-His car could have been stolen.
-We don't know that.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.134
-He's missing!
-Okay.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.135
Isn't that enough?

05:02.218 --> 05:05.430
Look, he's-- [scoffs] He's 16, 17.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.056
Just turned 18.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.642
Oh! Oh, so he's just about
to graduate high school?

05:10.685 --> 05:12.729
-Yeah.
-So...

05:12.812 --> 05:14.689
-So, what?
-So he's probably...

05:15.273 --> 05:16.399
out on South Beach

05:16.482 --> 05:19.277
or, you know, well, I know
you probably don't want to hear this,

05:19.360 --> 05:20.862
but hanging out with some girl.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.364
You know? Doing what teenage boys do.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.532
Yeah.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.868
I mean, that's what I was doing
at that age.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.119
Uh-huh.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.999
Listen, I'd still appreciate it
if you all would--

05:33.082 --> 05:34.417
Ma'am, we will.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.753
But you said that before,
and you're leaving.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.922
And I would really like to know
what is going on.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.759
Look, I told you, as soon as
the AM liaison officer gets here--

05:42.842 --> 05:43.843
-No, I mean now.
-Sorry?

05:43.926 --> 05:44.927
I want to know now.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.556
Well, I will be happy to walk you back out
to reception.

05:48.639 --> 05:52.018
-You could check again to see--
-I was just at reception for half an hour.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.145
-There's not much more I can--
-And the lady there,

05:54.228 --> 05:56.814
-she was no help at all.
-I-- I understand.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.858
Look, she sent me to you.
This can't be that hard.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.527
-I'm very sorry, ma'am, I--
-Either he's in the system or he isn't.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.363
Ma'am, no disrespect,
but we have a protocol.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.240
Listen, I may seem paranoid,
but he's not home.

06:07.408 --> 06:11.037
His car is showing up on your radar.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.163
-Humor me.
-Ma'am,

06:12.246 --> 06:14.248
as soon
as the AM liaison officer gets here.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.708
Officer, please.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.711
-I don't know what you expect me to do.
-Well, don't you all have computers?

06:18.795 --> 06:21.464
I don't know, a database with names
and DOBs you can--

06:21.547 --> 06:24.884
Yes, but I am not authorized
to just go running down the rabbit hole.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.969
-What if somebody walks in, and they...?
-Please.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.305
[sighs]

06:35.103 --> 06:36.396
-Fine.
-[weeping]

06:37.021 --> 06:37.897
[softly] Thank you.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.857
But I'm gonna need
some additional information.

06:39.941 --> 06:40.817
-Sure.
-All right.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.985
Just let me-- Let me get something.

Hmm.

06:53.621 --> 06:54.914
[outbound text swooshes]

07:03.631 --> 07:04.549
First name again?

07:04.632 --> 07:06.342
Jamal, J-A-M-A-L.

07:06.717 --> 07:07.677
Last name, Connor.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.636
Yes. [chuckles]

07:09.846 --> 07:11.305
-Is that E-R?
-No, O-R.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.640
C-O-N-N-O-R.

07:12.723 --> 07:13.641
DOB?

07:13.724 --> 07:15.101
5/1/2001.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.018
Any priors?

07:17.061 --> 07:17.895
Sorry?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.648
Priors.
Has he ever been arrested before?

07:21.691 --> 07:22.984
Oh. No. [chuckles]

07:23.067 --> 07:23.985
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.070
-Even juvie.
-Juvie?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.531
-Does he have a <i>juvenile</i> record?
-No.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.032
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

07:31.659 --> 07:34.537
Not even a trespassing
or resisting without, petty theft?

07:34.620 --> 07:37.874
He's never so much as torn the tag
off a new mattress,  okay?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.375
-Excuse me?
-Nothing.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.377
No-- No arrest record at all.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.922
Hmm. Uh, does he go by any other names?

07:45.256 --> 07:46.340
Like a nickname?

07:46.424 --> 07:47.884
I mean, his father calls him J.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.427
No. Uh, AKAs?

07:51.012 --> 07:52.638
-I'm sorry?
-AKAs.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.808
You know, "also known as."
Like, street names.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.101
Street names?

07:57.185 --> 08:00.855
Yeah. Well, if he was taken into custody
under a different alias, right?

08:00.938 --> 08:03.274
He gave a different--
Well, different from some other time

08:03.357 --> 08:05.902
-is all I'm saying.
-I just told you he's never been arrested.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.112
But just in case
he might have been printed for,

08:08.196 --> 08:11.574
I don't know, whatever.
Or had a warning issued, or...

08:12.158 --> 08:13.493
-A street name?
-Right.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.996
-Like Peanut? Or Black?
-Exactly.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.080
Or Pookie.

08:19.081 --> 08:19.916
Yes, ma'am.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.212
Well, there's June Bug.

08:24.545 --> 08:25.880
-June Bug.
-Yup.

08:25.963 --> 08:28.007
-That's his street name?
-Jesus Christ.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.091
-[officer] Is it?
-No.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.428
It's not an alias. It's not a street name.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.346
You sure?

08:33.429 --> 08:35.431
It's what I used to call him
when he was little.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.018
It's what I call him now
when I want to knock the cool out of him

08:39.101 --> 08:41.229
in front of his friends.
He doesn't have a street name.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.733
Can you please just run all this
through your computer...

08:45.816 --> 08:48.653
-Ma'am! I am going to.
-...and find out what is going on?

08:48.736 --> 08:51.781
I just need to make sure that we have
all the correct information here,

08:51.864 --> 08:53.824
so we aren't just spinning our wheels.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.910
[thunder rumbling]

08:58.579 --> 08:59.413
Fine.

09:04.001 --> 09:04.919
Height?

09:05.962 --> 09:06.837
Six-two.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.674
Maybe a little taller
since last time we measured him.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.842
-He really shot up this year--
-Uh-huh. Weight?

09:16.222 --> 09:20.351
Uh, 180... 185, thereabouts.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.234
Glasses.

09:28.734 --> 09:29.652
Hmm.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.654
Cornrows.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.491
Light green eyes.

09:39.036 --> 09:39.996
[officer] Okay, good.

09:40.079 --> 09:43.708
Uh, do you remember what he was wearing
when he left last night?

09:45.251 --> 09:47.670
I-I don't know.
Probably jeans and a T-shirt.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.757
All right. Does he have
any distinguishing, you know...

09:54.427 --> 09:55.595
Like a birthmark?

09:55.678 --> 09:59.682
Yeah. Scars, tattoos, gold teeth.
That kind of stuff.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.893
No. No tattoos. No golds.

10:04.645 --> 10:07.481
His only scar is on his stomach,
right here.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.108
Great. And that's from?

10:09.191 --> 10:11.068
-The scar?
-Yeah, where did he get it?

10:11.777 --> 10:13.529
You mean, how did he get it?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.323
Well, both, I guess, yeah.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.824
-Does this matter?
-[officer] Ma'am--

10:16.907 --> 10:18.576
-It's not from a gang fight.
-[officer] Okay.

10:18.659 --> 10:19.869
-Lady, listen--
-Officer.

10:19.952 --> 10:23.539
Respectfully, are there
that many 6'2" black boys

10:23.623 --> 10:25.249
involved in incidents tonight,

10:25.333 --> 10:26.959
you need to know
if they might just have

10:27.043 --> 10:28.127
scars on their tummies?

10:28.210 --> 10:30.254
Not unless you want to find him. I mean--

10:30.338 --> 10:33.424
Okay, Jamal's sign is Taurus
with Virgo rising.

10:33.507 --> 10:35.885
He's bashful, looks away when he smiles.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.095
-Really, I am just looking for...
-He plays the guitar.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.847
-Especially likes blues and rock.
-Ma'am.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.557
-Old '70s and '80s bands.
-[officer] Ma'am--

10:41.641 --> 10:43.517
I tried to turn him on to Funkadelic

10:43.601 --> 10:45.061
-and DeBarge...
-Ma'am, I--

10:45.144 --> 10:46.687
...but he's strictly
mainstream classic stuff.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.648
-Clapton. Van Halen.
-[officer, irritably] Okay.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.608
He throws a mean breaking ball,
whatever that means.

10:50.691 --> 10:51.984
-All right. Listen--
-He's vegetarian,

10:52.068 --> 10:54.612
hates fried chicken,
and he's afraid of clowns.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.280
-Ma'am--
-He walks like a jock,

10:56.364 --> 10:59.033
but he can recite
almost any Emily Dickinson poem.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.951
-Okay.
-And he still gets a tear in his eye

11:01.035 --> 11:03.037
whenever he hears
"Puff the Magic Dragon."

11:04.664 --> 11:06.666
[thunder rumbling]

11:06.749 --> 11:07.958
[woman sighs]

11:08.709 --> 11:09.585
Sorry.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.598
I-I love Emily Dickinson.

11:24.767 --> 11:28.604
"It is a far, far better thing I do
than I've ever done.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.191
-It is a far, far better..."
-That's Charles Dickens.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.945
Mmm... I don't think so.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.783
Anyway, uh, let me see
what I can find out, okay?

11:40.866 --> 11:44.704
Oh, hey, was he angry or upset
about anything last night?

11:45.079 --> 11:45.913
Why?

11:46.539 --> 11:49.417
Well, just in case he had a reason to,
you know, run off

11:49.500 --> 11:51.460
and chill for a while.

11:52.503 --> 11:53.546
No.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.298
-[thunder crashes]
-Okay. Cool.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.135
-Uh, help yourself to a donut.
-Really?

11:59.218 --> 12:01.804
Yeah. I know. What can I say?
We really do like 'em.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.348
-[indistinct police radio chatter]
-[door clicks]

12:04.432 --> 12:05.599
Unbelievable.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.268
[door closes]

12:18.112 --> 12:20.239
-[cell phone ringing]
-[whispering] Oh, God.

12:23.784 --> 12:26.036
Hey, you on your way down here, I hope?

12:28.956 --> 12:29.957
O-Okay.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.377
Not yet.

12:34.795 --> 12:35.713
I don't know.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.841
Scott-- No, Scott,
I said I don't know.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.509
I've been trying to find out.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.513
Well, because they're being very evasive.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.974
I have no idea why.

12:47.057 --> 12:50.019
Well, that's not true.
I have some idea why. I--

12:50.519 --> 12:52.354
I am keeping my cool.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.898
It's-- It's not helping.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.400
That's why it'd be nice if you were here.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.239
Well, I called you almost an hour ago.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.370
Yeah, I'm keenly aware
of what time it is.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.166
Well, you know what?

13:12.249 --> 13:14.960
Maybe if you were home in your own bed

13:15.044 --> 13:18.964
instead of sleeping in someone else's,
we wouldn't be having this discussion.

13:20.382 --> 13:21.801
No, I'm not starting.

13:22.718 --> 13:23.886
I said I'm not.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.517
No, I'm dropping it.
Okay, but you-- [sighs]

13:31.393 --> 13:33.479
In a waiting room somewhere in the back.

13:35.689 --> 13:39.485
When you come through the entrance,
turn left, park in the main lot up front.

13:39.568 --> 13:40.736
Go to the info desk.

13:41.445 --> 13:44.865
Ask for Officer Larkin. Larkin.

13:45.574 --> 13:46.992
I don't know, some...

13:47.827 --> 13:50.329
low-level newbie
who ain't all that bright.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.457
Yeah, okay. Bye.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.501
[groans, chuckles]

13:56.544 --> 13:57.503
Shit.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.922
[siren wailing]

14:04.218 --> 14:05.177
[sighs]

14:28.784 --> 14:29.869
[lock screen clicks]

14:34.874 --> 14:36.876
[ringing]

14:41.463 --> 14:42.715
[sighs]

14:45.551 --> 14:46.468
[voicemail beeps]

14:46.552 --> 14:48.304
It's Mama again, baby.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.641
I know you're still very upset,

14:52.725 --> 14:57.938
and... we both said a lot of things
we shouldn't have last night,

14:58.022 --> 15:00.316
but I am worried about you.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.443
Please call me.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.696
[thunder crashing]

15:09.325 --> 15:10.409
[door clicks]

15:15.122 --> 15:17.207
-So?
-[Larkin] Okay, there was an incident.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.292
-An incident!
-The car--

15:18.375 --> 15:20.461
If you will allow me, please.

15:25.674 --> 15:28.344
There was an incident. We don't know what.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.596
The car was stopped,

15:31.221 --> 15:33.807
and there is a pending investigation.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.978
What does that mean?

15:38.395 --> 15:39.605
That is all I can tell you.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.315
Uh, Lieutenant Stokes,

15:41.398 --> 15:43.275
he doesn't normally get in
until about 8:00,

15:43.359 --> 15:46.487
and I've been instructed that all further
information needs to go through him.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.613
I'm sorry, who?

15:47.696 --> 15:48.864
Lieutenant Stokes.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.116
Oh, he's the AM public affairs
liaison officer.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.370
Look, I'm-- I'm pretty new here.
I don't know him personally.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.915
They told me that he's been paged
to come down here immediately, but--

15:57.998 --> 16:00.542
But he might not get here
for another few hours?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.544
-He's been paged.
-That's when he normally comes in.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.545
Apparently.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.047
Not acceptable.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.632
No, ma'am. It is what it is. I...

16:06.715 --> 16:08.133
No. I called the police

16:08.217 --> 16:09.969
-at three o'clock in the morning.
-[sighs]

16:10.052 --> 16:12.137
-I'm told my car's been involved--
-It's not your car.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.555
My son's car!

16:16.141 --> 16:18.769
My son is missing.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.938
Now you're telling me he's in custody?

16:21.021 --> 16:23.107
-No.
-He might be?

16:23.190 --> 16:25.651
-No. We don't know that yet.
-We don't really know anything yet.

16:25.734 --> 16:26.652
We don't know much.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.737
-No. That is my point.
-Is my son in custody or not?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.447
I told you,
you're gonna have to be patient

16:30.531 --> 16:32.825
and wait for the AM liaison officer
to get here.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.576
I sat out in that lobby
almost half an hour

16:34.660 --> 16:36.286
before I even got to speak to you.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.580
I completely understand your concerns.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.582
Respectfully, officer,
I don't think you do.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.126
-Ma'am, I have kids too.
-[woman] Do you?

16:42.209 --> 16:44.086
-Okay. I do.
-How old are they?

16:44.169 --> 16:46.130
-[Larkin] Well, they're--
-Any of them black?

16:49.049 --> 16:50.134
Excuse me?

16:50.551 --> 16:52.594
Do you have any black sons...

16:53.721 --> 16:54.763
this big...

16:55.639 --> 16:57.808
who might just be sitting
in police custody

16:57.891 --> 16:59.643
at four o'clock in the morning?

16:59.727 --> 17:00.728
[sniffles]

17:02.646 --> 17:04.982
-Look, Ms. Connor. I...
-Ms. Ellis-Connor.

17:07.233 --> 17:09.153
-Ms. Ellis-Connor...
-[Ellis-Connor] Mm-hmm?

17:09.236 --> 17:10.988
I am doing the best that I can...

17:11.070 --> 17:13.156
-Do you have a black son?
-...to help figure out--

17:13.240 --> 17:14.992
Wow. We are really gonna go there?

17:15.075 --> 17:16.660
Oh, we've been there for a <i>while.</i>

17:19.621 --> 17:21.290
[Larkin] No, ma'am.

17:23.666 --> 17:24.917
I have two...

17:26.211 --> 17:27.963
young daughters.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.258
White daughters.

17:39.433 --> 17:43.437
Then let's skip the empathy tactic, okay?

17:44.229 --> 17:45.731
Because, believe me...

17:47.024 --> 17:48.734
you got no idea.

17:52.112 --> 17:52.988
Fine.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.329
Whatever.

18:00.704 --> 18:03.499
You know what? I really thought
that we had developed a kind of--

18:03.582 --> 18:04.750
Why are you still here?

18:04.833 --> 18:06.126
-I'm sorry?
-Go.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.045
-[Larkin] Excuse me?
-Please. Go find Jamal.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.380
-Find my son.
-I told you, Lieutenant Stokes

18:10.464 --> 18:12.674
-will be here any minute.
-I don't care who's on his way.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.176
You got a badge too!

18:14.259 --> 18:15.594
-You people...
-Ma'am.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.971
...got computers and cell phones,
police radios.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.307
You mean to tell me
you can't walk out that door

18:20.390 --> 18:23.018
in five minutes
and find out where my son is?

18:23.102 --> 18:24.937
-Look, I--
-Where is he?

18:25.020 --> 18:26.021
I understand you're tense.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.731
-[groans]
-I understand this must be upsetting.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.650
-Stop telling me you understand.
-Ma'am, listen.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.401
-And stop calling me "ma'am."
-Okay.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.279
Okay.

18:36.657 --> 18:37.616
Listen...

18:38.242 --> 18:42.162
[slowly] as soon
as Lieutenant Stokes gets here,

18:42.246 --> 18:45.290
I am going to see
that you speak to him immediately.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.584
We are gonna find out
where Jerome is and--

18:47.668 --> 18:48.794
Jamal.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.754
-Jamal. His name is Jamal!
-I'm sorry.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.089
-I'm sorry. I--
-God damn it!

18:52.172 --> 18:54.174
-Stop screaming at me!
-Okay! Okay.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.176
Okay. [inhales sharply]

18:56.260 --> 18:58.595
[thunder rumbling]

19:00.139 --> 19:00.973
All right.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.100
[breathes deeply]

19:03.851 --> 19:04.726
Let me--

19:07.855 --> 19:09.106
Let me start again.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.821
I am... so sorry

19:15.904 --> 19:19.992
if I implied or suggested
any bad faith on your part.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.744
I-I completely understand your concerns.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.079
[scoffs]

19:25.080 --> 19:25.914
What?

19:28.917 --> 19:31.712
You keep saying that,
"I-I understand.

19:31.795 --> 19:34.965
I... share your concerns."

19:35.048 --> 19:38.302
Is that from some HR training video
or something?

19:38.385 --> 19:41.305
-No.
-"When dealing with a problem personality,

19:41.388 --> 19:43.515
-put the person at ease."
-What?

19:43.599 --> 19:44.766
-"Diffuse the situation."
-No.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.351
-"Echo their feelings."
-I don't know--

19:46.435 --> 19:49.771
Look, I have a PhD in psychology.
I teach at the university. Okay?

19:49.855 --> 19:51.440
So I know when I'm being managed.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.983
Ma'am. Ms. Connor.

19:53.066 --> 19:56.278
-Ellis-Connor.
-I am not managing you.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.739
Jesus. I'm just trying to be nice.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.617
Sure.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.286
[softly] You...

20:04.369 --> 20:05.204
Look...

20:06.914 --> 20:08.207
we have a protocol.

20:10.500 --> 20:11.710
[sighs]

20:19.635 --> 20:20.636
I...

20:21.762 --> 20:23.889
Look, I'm supposed to follow it,
but, you know,

20:23.972 --> 20:25.432
let me see if I can...

20:26.934 --> 20:28.977
I-- if I can pull a few strings.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.522
You know,
before Lieutenant Stokes gets here.

20:33.106 --> 20:35.442
Just get a little more info, okay?

20:35.525 --> 20:37.986
-I would really appreciate that.
-All right, just--

20:38.070 --> 20:39.696
Just give me a few minutes.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.617
-Do you-- Do you need anything?
-[sighs]

20:44.117 --> 20:47.120
I <i>swear,</i> I am just being nice.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.547
[sighs] Some water.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.510
There is a water fountain down the hall.

21:01.593 --> 21:02.636
Great.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.471
It's out the door,
around the corner to your left.

21:04.554 --> 21:05.889
-Thank you.
-There's two, actually.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.724
-They're right next to each other.
-Two doors?

21:07.808 --> 21:09.101
No, sorry. Two water fountains.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.228
You can't miss them.
They're right next to each other.

21:11.311 --> 21:14.523
It's 'cause the building's really old,
and when it was built, it was...

21:18.318 --> 21:19.444
Segregated?

21:23.907 --> 21:24.783
Yeah.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.329
There's, um...

21:31.331 --> 21:33.667
you know, above--
above the water fountains,

21:33.750 --> 21:34.793
there's, like, um...

21:35.627 --> 21:37.713
there's, like, a commemorative plaque...

21:38.630 --> 21:40.632
dedicated to, like, the Big Five
or something.

21:41.133 --> 21:41.967
The Big Six.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.260
The Big Six!

21:43.844 --> 21:47.264
Yeah. Yeah, Abernathy and, uh...

21:48.140 --> 21:50.309
I can't remember all of them.
It's just-- ah, it's...

21:50.392 --> 21:52.561
fascinating, you know,  just the history.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.231
Well, you know, I mean...

21:57.441 --> 21:58.608
all they did for...

22:01.862 --> 22:02.696
people.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.252
[vehicle approaching]

22:18.754 --> 22:20.297
[under breath] Son of a bitch.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.719
[door opens]

22:25.802 --> 22:27.054
[sniffling]

22:27.137 --> 22:28.472
[door closes]

23:03.548 --> 23:06.760
-Excuse me. Are you--
-I was just texting Amy to get your ETA.

23:06.843 --> 23:08.553
Jesus Christ, what took you so long?

23:08.637 --> 23:10.222
-Excuse me?
-Yeah. I'm sorry, sir.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.391
It's just this lady has been
really difficult and...

23:12.474 --> 23:13.934
Yeah. I'm here about Jamal Connor.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.645
Right, right.
And she's gonna be right back so--

23:16.728 --> 23:18.772
Okay. So far, um, all I know,

23:18.855 --> 23:20.107
the car is pulled over.

23:20.190 --> 23:23.527
Uh, three black males in a Lexus,
like, a late model Lexus,

23:23.610 --> 23:25.028
-I think.
-Okay. Hold on.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.863
Expired tags or the driver's texting,

23:26.947 --> 23:28.698
not really clear on the reason
for the stop.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.242
-Exigent circumstances, I guess.
-Okay.

23:30.325 --> 23:33.203
There's not much in the system.
Logged to the General Investigations Unit.

23:33.286 --> 23:35.414
-The GIU?
-Yeah, so, probably no big deal, right?

23:35.497 --> 23:38.083
I mean, I got somebody in the GIU
to give me a little bit of info...

23:38.166 --> 23:40.544
-Listen. Slow down.
-I know that's against protocol.

23:40.627 --> 23:43.922
I'm just trying to keep the natives at bay
until the cavalry arrives, you know?

23:44.005 --> 23:45.215
Man, I'm glad you're here.

23:45.298 --> 23:46.967
-Sorry. It's Officer Larkin, right?
-Yeah.

23:47.050 --> 23:49.052
Let me just back up,
make sure I understand what it is...

23:49.136 --> 23:51.388
Wait till you see this lady.
Bitch is totally out of control.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.473
I mean, I got kids too.

23:53.557 --> 23:57.018
Right? But she went from, like,
zero to ghetto in nothing flat.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.478
[door closes]

23:58.562 --> 24:00.105
[Larkin] Ma'am, this is Lieutenant...

24:00.188 --> 24:01.022
-Hey.
-[Scott] Hey.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.816
-Jesus Christ, Scott.
-[Scott] It's okay.

24:02.899 --> 24:03.984
Everything's gonna be fine.

24:06.736 --> 24:07.946
Where's our son?

24:13.160 --> 24:16.079
Lieutenant Stokes is on his way.
I'm really sorry for the delay.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.622
They haven't told me anything, Scott.

24:17.706 --> 24:18.623
-Not a thing.
-Okay.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.251
They don't know if Jamal's been arrested
or if he's in custody.

24:21.334 --> 24:24.337
Calm down. I wanna talk
to the GIU detective interrogating my son.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.756
Listen, as I have been telling your...

24:27.549 --> 24:29.551
her, I'm not at liberty
to give you more information.

24:29.634 --> 24:31.470
-Now.
-I'm sorry. Who exactly are you?

24:31.553 --> 24:33.555
I'm Scott Connor.
I'm Jamal Connor's father.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.099
-No. I'm talking about...
-Oh. I'm an FBI agent.

24:36.558 --> 24:37.392
Oh.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.562
-I'm sorry if that confused you.
-Yeah...

24:40.645 --> 24:43.815
My son's a minor, we have a right to speak
with him before you interrogate him.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.775
-I'm sorry, sir. I'm not authorized--
-Scott...

24:45.859 --> 24:48.945
I don't want you to be sorry. Take me
to whoever is interrogating my son.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.405
-Scott!
-What?

24:50.489 --> 24:53.158
His birthday was last month.
Remember? He's 18.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.912
-Shit. I knew that.
-[Ellis-Connor] It's okay.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.413
-Of course.
-God damn it. I got him the car.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.081
-You know I knew that.
-Hey, I said it's okay.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.501
It's four o'clock in the morning.
I haven't had a cup of coffee.

25:02.584 --> 25:03.418
-I understand.
-Look--

25:03.502 --> 25:05.253
Lieutenant Stokes
should be here very soon.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.632
I wanna know what's going on with my son,
you've been in contact with the detective.

25:08.715 --> 25:09.674
I'd like to have a word.

25:09.758 --> 25:10.926
-[Larkin] No, sir.
-Excuse me?

25:11.009 --> 25:13.845
I have not been in contact
with the GIU detective.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.722
[Scott] Two seconds ago,
you just said you had.

25:15.805 --> 25:18.016
No, sir. That is not correct.
I got somebody in GIU

25:18.099 --> 25:21.895
to-- to read me a bit of information,
secondhand, off the daily log sheet.

25:21.978 --> 25:22.979
-That is all.
-Uh-huh.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.273
I've not been able to speak with anybody
about the case yet.

25:25.357 --> 25:29.903
There's a protocol that we have to follow,
and it involves the AM liaison officer.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.989
-And you don't know when he'll be here?
-Very soon, I hope.

25:36.076 --> 25:38.828
But if you'd rather not wait here,
that's fine.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.957
Uh, you can leave me your cell number.
I'd be happy to call you when he arrives.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.750
There's a Denny's on the corner.

25:43.833 --> 25:46.378
-Yeah, it's a very short walk.
-Thank you. We'll wait.

25:47.963 --> 25:48.797
Sure.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.258
Can I-- Can I get you anything?

25:51.341 --> 25:52.259
-Coffee?
-I'm fine.

25:52.342 --> 25:53.426
Coffee would be great.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.554
-[Larkin] Cream? Sugar?
-No, I like it black.

25:55.637 --> 25:56.513
Well...

26:01.309 --> 26:03.353
[Larkin] Listen, I'm sure
that this is no big deal.

26:03.436 --> 26:06.356
I just started working here,
but they tell me this happens every night.

26:06.439 --> 26:07.274
[scoffs]

26:07.357 --> 26:10.110
We have a skeleton crew in admin
on the late shift.

26:10.193 --> 26:13.196
It can take forever for information
to filter down, so...

26:13.280 --> 26:15.490
Well, I apologize if I was, you know...

26:15.574 --> 26:16.616
[Larkin] No, not at all.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.578
And, listen, I'm really sorry
about when you came in and I--

26:19.661 --> 26:21.121
-Yeah.
-Sorry about what?

26:21.204 --> 26:22.122
Nothing.

26:29.170 --> 26:30.171
-FBI, huh?
-Yeah.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.464
-That's awesome.
-[Scott] Thanks.

26:31.548 --> 26:32.549
[Larkin] It's my dream job.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.259
-Is it?
-Mm-hmm. Behavioral analysis.

26:34.342 --> 26:35.927
-Really?
-Yeah. I applied,

26:36.011 --> 26:38.054
but they told me
I needed investigative experience,

26:38.138 --> 26:39.431
which is why I joined the force.

26:39.514 --> 26:42.017
[Scott] Well, I hope you kicked ass
in differential equations

26:42.100 --> 26:43.393
-or whatever...
-[chuckling] Yeah.

26:43.476 --> 26:46.187
BS in Forensics at Jacksonville State.
Go, Gamecocks!

26:46.271 --> 26:48.148
Good. 'Cause those guys
in the Ted Bundy Brigade,

26:48.231 --> 26:49.107
they're smart as hell.

26:49.190 --> 26:51.401
[Larkin chuckling] The Ted Bundy Brigade,
that is awesome.

26:51.484 --> 26:53.111
Yeah. They don't like to be called that.

26:53.194 --> 26:55.530
It's what the rest of us call 'em
when we wanna piss 'em off.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.448
Right.

26:56.531 --> 26:58.950
I'd be happy to put a good word in for you
when the time comes.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.285
-[Larkin] Really?
-Give me a call.

27:00.368 --> 27:01.494
That would be so awesome.

27:01.578 --> 27:02.829
-Thank you so much.
-[Scott] You bet.

27:02.912 --> 27:04.623
So, the Lexus.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.999
It's registered to me.

27:06.374 --> 27:07.292
-The...
-The car,

27:07.375 --> 27:09.294
my son's car, is registered in my name.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.629
Scott Alan Connor.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.881
-It was a birthday gift.
-[Larkin] Oh, nice.

27:12.964 --> 27:15.342
Yeah. Well, pre-owned.
Still a little indulgent, I guess...

27:15.425 --> 27:16.384
Oh, yeah. Whatever.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.802
He worked very hard.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.512
-Bit of a reach for us, but...
-We thought he'd earned it.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.890
[Scott] Anyway, we kept it in my name
for the insurance.

27:21.973 --> 27:24.100
But I can tell all that
to the GIU guy myself

27:24.184 --> 27:26.019
when you bring me down there
to talk to him.

27:26.102 --> 27:28.021
Right. So, coffee...

27:28.897 --> 27:29.856
No cream, no sugar.

27:29.939 --> 27:30.815
I'm on it.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.073
[Scott sighs]

27:40.617 --> 27:41.451
What?

27:42.327 --> 27:43.453
-What?
-Nothing.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.246
No, not nothing. What?

27:45.330 --> 27:47.666
Why don't you just offer
to cut and blow out his hair,

27:47.749 --> 27:49.626
give him a hand massage, for God's sake?

27:49.709 --> 27:50.669
-Kendra.
-I mean...

27:50.752 --> 27:52.337
-I'm just trying to be civil.
-Whatever.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.838
-Acting all crazy...
-Who's acting crazy?

27:53.922 --> 27:55.340
...isn't gonna help the situation.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.425
They have our son.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.261
We wanna know where he is.
They can tell us.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.346
This ain't complicated.

28:01.429 --> 28:02.681
This is a bureaucracy.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.974
I think you're assuming the worst,
when the truth be told,

28:05.058 --> 28:06.768
the current situation
is probably a whole nother thing.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.353
-Oh...
-Look, I work at a bureaucracy.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.063
I'm telling you,
you're not gonna get anywhere

28:10.146 --> 28:11.940
chewing out some low-level yes-man.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.817
I've been here for almost an hour.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.360
-Look, alls I'm saying--
-"All."

28:15.443 --> 28:16.361
All?

28:16.528 --> 28:17.904
<i>"All </i> you're saying."

28:17.987 --> 28:20.740
"All" is not plural.
It's not a possessive.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.410
There's no such word as "alls."
Just "all."

28:24.786 --> 28:25.870
Seriously?

28:26.496 --> 28:28.206
Jamal doesn't "ax a question."

28:28.289 --> 28:29.666
He doesn't speak Ebonics.

28:29.749 --> 28:32.627
-You don't get to speak white trash.
-Oh, Christ, Kendra...

28:32.711 --> 28:33.670
"Alls I'm saying."

28:33.753 --> 28:34.879
"A whole nother."

28:34.963 --> 28:36.047
Just purge that shit.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.465
-I'm sorry. "A whole nother"?
-Yeah.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.968
"The current situation is probably
a whole nother thing."

28:40.051 --> 28:41.720
Sweet sweating Jesus, Kendra.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.304
-The word is "another." One word.
-Okay.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.557
Don't go shoving the word "whole"
in the middle of it.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.684
Can we not just go off in the weeds
on some...

28:47.767 --> 28:49.352
This isn't "off in the weeds."

28:50.395 --> 28:53.732
You know how I killed myself to make sure
Jamal speaks proper English.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.900
-Yeah, believe me, I know. Yeah.
-Okay? Good.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.738
[thunder rumbling]

29:05.452 --> 29:07.454
I mean, you just said "ain't"
two seconds ago,

29:07.537 --> 29:09.581
but I <i>ain't</i> allowed to.
That makes perfect sense.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.374
I said "ain't" for emphasis.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.168
-You just speak bad English.
-Jesus.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.170
It's like every little thing
with you lately.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.088
No, this isn't every <i>little</i> thing.

29:18.339 --> 29:22.051
As hard as I worked to make him fit in,

29:22.135 --> 29:25.138
it's a slap in my face
when you cavalierly lapse

29:25.221 --> 29:26.681
into "Okie from Muskogee."

29:27.182 --> 29:28.183
Can we just--

29:28.683 --> 29:30.852
Let's see if we can get our arms
around the here and now.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.854
Find out where J's at and not, you know,

29:32.937 --> 29:34.606
rehash the last five years
of our marriage.

29:34.689 --> 29:35.899
-Would that be okay?
-[Kendra] Sure.

29:35.982 --> 29:36.816
Good.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.236
[lock screen clicks]

29:40.320 --> 29:42.739
And I've never forced you
to make him fit in.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.657
-Whatever.
-Hey, I let you name him Jamal.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.284
-Didn't I?
-"Let me"?

29:46.743 --> 29:48.036
-Here we go again.
-Right?

29:48.119 --> 29:49.370
Baby, I'm sorry,

29:49.454 --> 29:52.248
I love your Irish people and all,

29:52.332 --> 29:54.667
but I simply wasn't gonna go through life
with a son named--

29:54.751 --> 29:57.003
What was it you were putting on the table
at the time?

29:57.378 --> 29:58.546
Seamus.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.132
-[chuckling] Hell, no.
-[Scott chuckling]

30:01.549 --> 30:04.469
I'd have gone with something else.
Liam, Aidan...

30:04.552 --> 30:05.595
Lord.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.014
[laughing]

30:08.932 --> 30:11.226
I needed to commemorate my brother.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.648
I thought you understood that.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.191
I did.

30:18.274 --> 30:19.317
[scoffs]

30:19.567 --> 30:20.401
You know...

30:20.902 --> 30:23.863
you may not remember,
but in Arabic, Jamal means beauty.

30:23.947 --> 30:25.824
Means beauty. Yes, how could I forget?

30:27.242 --> 30:29.244
"Hey, Beauty.
You wanna toss a football around?"

30:29.327 --> 30:31.246
-[scoffs]
-I can't wait 'til he's 21

30:31.329 --> 30:33.540
so me and the guys can head on over
to the tavern

30:33.623 --> 30:35.667
and hoist a glass of whiskey
with ol' Beauty.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.085
-My, oh, my.
-Maybe he'll bring his friends

30:37.168 --> 30:39.712
Chastity and Mother's Milk
along as designated drivers.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.756
Is your sense of masculinity
really that delicate?

30:41.840 --> 30:44.342
-[outbound text swoosh]
-Of course not, Kenny. Come on.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.427
It's just a hell of a fun button to push.

30:46.511 --> 30:49.305
His name is fine, all right?

30:52.267 --> 30:54.227
You can't even say it half the time.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.188
It's always "J" this, "J" that.

30:57.272 --> 31:00.608
Oh, come on. I got a nickname for my son.
That's just a male bonding thing.

31:00.692 --> 31:01.901
Just man up and say it.

31:01.985 --> 31:03.695
You've always hated his name...

31:03.987 --> 31:05.405
because it's too black.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.156
You're the one who just said

31:07.240 --> 31:10.243
-Seamus was too Irish.
-You think his name's a handicap.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.620
Well, you know what? On a scale from...

31:13.121 --> 31:16.583
Eric Holder to, you know, Darnell Jackson,

31:17.417 --> 31:19.586
Jamal is brushing
right up against Darnell.

31:21.504 --> 31:25.383
It must be terrible feeling so alienated
from your own flesh and blood.

31:26.259 --> 31:29.387
Hey, I'd challenge hell's furies
for that kid, and you know that.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.181
My only son.

31:36.936 --> 31:40.106
-Should we try calling him again?
-I've already tried about 15 times.

31:40.189 --> 31:41.608
I just keep getting his voicemail.

31:41.691 --> 31:44.611
Yeah, me too.
"Hey, this is Jamal. Have a <i>blessed</i> day."

31:44.694 --> 31:46.446
When did that bullshit start?

31:46.654 --> 31:48.698
He's been going
with me and Mama to church.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.743
Thank you, by the way.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.870
-[Scott] For what?
-For taking her to dialysis.

31:53.953 --> 31:55.830
-[Scott] Oh, please.
-No, it's a huge help.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.540
Bobby's like my own mother, you know that.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.292
-[Kendra] I know.
-She is a tough old broad.

31:59.375 --> 32:02.253
She thinks the sun rises and sets on you.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.926
She blames me for all of this.

32:08.635 --> 32:09.469
[scoffs]

32:15.391 --> 32:16.684
[sighs]

32:17.268 --> 32:18.353
You look good.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.063
-Oh, Jesus.
-[Scott] Well, you do.

32:20.146 --> 32:21.397
Please don't go there.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.358
We haven't really
seen each other since... you know.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.984
-Oh, I know.
-Oh, can't I just notice?

32:25.068 --> 32:26.152
What did you expect, Scott?

32:26.235 --> 32:28.488
Four months without you,
and I'd completely fall apart?

32:28.571 --> 32:29.822
Is that what you were hoping?

32:29.906 --> 32:32.367
-Christ. Forget I said anything.
-Yes! Let's just forget it.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.286
Let's just find our son and go back
to our respective corners, okay?

32:35.370 --> 32:36.704
-[Scott] Fine.
-[phone chimes]

32:39.791 --> 32:40.708
Is it Jamal?

32:42.210 --> 32:43.211
No.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.713
So, where was he last night?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.298
-I assume he went out.
-Yeah.

32:47.382 --> 32:48.549
-With who?
-I don't know.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.467
You don't know?

32:49.550 --> 32:52.011
-Why should I know?
-Jesus Christ. Kendra.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.972
I don't grill him every time
he leaves the house.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.682
He's a grown man. I trust his judgment.

32:55.765 --> 32:57.976
You're the one who insisted
that J live with you.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.310
-[chuckles]
-Which I was okay with.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.229
But you took on an obligation
to be responsible--

33:01.312 --> 33:03.940
I thought we weren't going to rehash
our entire relationship?

33:04.023 --> 33:05.274
-Okay. Fine.
-[Kendra] Fine.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.818
It's just, I hate to keep harping on it,

33:06.901 --> 33:09.195
but this kid's going to West Point
in, like, a month.

33:09.278 --> 33:11.990
-It is just not acceptable that he--
-Here we go.

33:12.073 --> 33:13.241
It's not, Kenny.

33:15.368 --> 33:18.329
Last few times he stayed at my place,
he looked like a goddamned gangster.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.706
A gangster?

33:19.789 --> 33:21.541
Yeah. A "gangsta." There, I said it.

33:21.624 --> 33:24.252
Why? Because he's not wearing
Brooks Brothers?

33:24.335 --> 33:26.587
Oh, the baggy pants, the cornrows,

33:26.671 --> 33:30.341
that stupid loping,
surly walk he suddenly developed.

33:30.425 --> 33:32.218
He's a teenage boy, okay?

33:32.301 --> 33:35.221
-A second ago he was a grown man.
-He's just trying to figure out who he is.

33:35.304 --> 33:38.099
-Oh, he's trying to figure out who he is?
-Explore his own identity.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.726
Christ almighty. Today it's cornrows,

33:39.809 --> 33:42.395
tomorrow he'll be out helping OJ
find the real killer.

33:42.478 --> 33:45.356
Okay. See that right there?
Comments like that...

33:46.107 --> 33:49.152
You just don't get it.
His world is not your world, Scott.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.112
Oh, yes, it is. It most certainly is.

33:51.195 --> 33:53.948
Look, I completely appreciate
how you had to grow up.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.617
Okay? The hard streets of Liberty City.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.953
Interstate cutting through. Redlining.
All of that.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.997
I admire it. I always have.

34:02.081 --> 34:03.583
It's one of the many reasons I...

34:06.878 --> 34:07.754
You what?

34:12.300 --> 34:14.635
-You what?
-His world is not that world.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.804
His world is definitely my world.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.889
We worked hard to make it my world.

34:18.973 --> 34:21.100
We spent almost
a quarter of a million dollars

34:21.184 --> 34:23.436
putting that kid
through the best prep schools in the city.

34:23.518 --> 34:25.646
He grew up in Coral Gables,
for Christ's sake.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.106
He's had every possible advantage.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.484
I simply will not accept him
regressing into...

34:29.567 --> 34:31.027
Into what?

34:32.487 --> 34:33.696
Just say it, Scott.

34:33.780 --> 34:36.866
That young man has no excuse
for getting himself into this situation.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.326
What situation?

34:38.743 --> 34:40.411
We don't even know what happened yet.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.705
Something happened.
I can take a pretty good guess what.

34:42.789 --> 34:46.417
Why are you automatically gonna blame him
before you even know anything?

34:46.501 --> 34:48.002
You know he's driving around
with two black kids?

34:48.085 --> 34:48.920
Oh, God forbid.

34:49.003 --> 34:50.463
Oh, please don't. Don't do that.

34:50.588 --> 34:51.422
Are you kidding me?

34:51.505 --> 34:54.717
Look, Kenny, it's just you and me in here,
so you can quit with the performance art.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.094
-Seriously?
-Kendra, come on.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.513
He was out with two other black kids,
that's the issue here?

34:58.596 --> 34:59.847
I mean what if--

35:03.518 --> 35:05.186
How do you know who he was with?

35:08.064 --> 35:08.940
This guy.

35:10.358 --> 35:11.567
-This cop?
-Yeah.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.861
-Well... when?
-When I walked in.

35:18.157 --> 35:21.327
[scoffs] So the whole hour I'm here,
he doesn't know a thing.

35:21.410 --> 35:24.580
The minute you walk in the door,
he's full of answers.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.332
I wouldn't necessarily say
"full of answers."

35:26.415 --> 35:28.209
But he told you Jamal was in a car
with two kids?

35:28.292 --> 35:29.752
-They were stopped.
-Two other black kids.

35:29.836 --> 35:31.796
-Yeah.
-Well, he never told <i>me</i> any of that.

35:31.879 --> 35:33.089
I wonder why that might be.

35:33.172 --> 35:36.134
Right now, I don't really care.
I just wanna know who they are.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.802
Didn't your new buddy there tell you?

35:37.885 --> 35:38.803
No.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.681
And I think you'll agree this demonstrates

35:41.764 --> 35:43.349
-some pretty questionable judgment.
-No.

35:43.432 --> 35:44.767
-Not necessarily.
-Really?

35:44.851 --> 35:47.311
He's got a right to be in a car
with his friends

35:47.395 --> 35:49.438
without getting dragged downtown
at 3:00 a.m.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.065
No one's saying
he doesn't have a right--

35:51.149 --> 35:52.859
Even if he's in a car
with his <i>black </i> friends!

35:52.942 --> 35:54.569
-What black friends?
-Oh, Scott, come on.

35:54.652 --> 35:55.611
What are you--

35:56.195 --> 35:57.572
Can't you see what you're saying?

35:57.655 --> 35:59.615
This is exactly what I'm saying.
Listen to me.

35:59.699 --> 36:00.783
What black friends?

36:00.867 --> 36:02.034
Was he with Jeffrey?

36:03.035 --> 36:06.080
Was he out with Nate or Manny?
Kids that we know and trust?

36:06.164 --> 36:08.374
-Because that'd be one thing.
-I told you, I don't know.

36:08.457 --> 36:10.084
No. And he certainly wasn't out with Al.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.170
No. Al's in Europe with his family
on vacation.

36:12.253 --> 36:15.047
Yeah. And Al is the only black kid
he hangs out with,

36:15.131 --> 36:18.217
-which is exactly my point.
-Funny. That's <i>exactly</i> my point.

36:18.301 --> 36:21.179
-Oh, look, Kendra, I--
-You think our bougie son

36:21.262 --> 36:23.598
has no right to associate
with other black kids

36:23.681 --> 36:26.142
without stamping a presumption of guilt
all over himself?

36:27.018 --> 36:30.938
No. I think our half-white, half-black,
who-gives-a-shit-what-race-he-is son...

36:31.522 --> 36:34.650
The one who got 1470 on his SATs
and aced AP Physics,

36:34.734 --> 36:36.861
knows better than to commit
unforced errors in life

36:36.944 --> 36:38.196
by taking stupid risks.

36:39.113 --> 36:41.657
Especially, when he is on the cusp
of doing great things.

36:41.741 --> 36:44.493
I think he understands that,
like it or not,

36:45.203 --> 36:47.830
the way that you present yourself in life
has consequences.

36:47.914 --> 36:50.541
If you wear your pants
halfway down your ass

36:50.625 --> 36:52.501
and ghetto hair, then you got--

36:52.585 --> 36:54.503
Then you got no right to complain
when you walk by

36:54.587 --> 36:56.505
and a white lady clutches her purse?

36:57.048 --> 36:59.217
You got no right to complain
when you walk by

36:59.300 --> 37:00.843
and <i>any </i> lady clutches her purse.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.929
No. No, no, no, no, no. That is not-- No.

37:03.012 --> 37:05.765
You are saying that associating
with other black kids

37:05.848 --> 37:07.266
is taking a stupid risk.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.143
Oh, come on, Kenny,
that's not what I'm saying.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.436
-Let me ask you.
-You know that!

37:10.519 --> 37:12.772
If this little asshole had told you
that Jamal was in a car

37:12.855 --> 37:15.983
with two white boys he barely knew,
would you be blaming him then?

37:16.067 --> 37:17.652
Would that be an unforced error?

37:17.735 --> 37:19.362
If I didn't know 'em, if I hadn't met 'em,

37:19.445 --> 37:21.447
black or white,
you're damn right, it would be.

37:21.530 --> 37:22.740
Scott...

37:23.241 --> 37:26.077
no matter how many privileges he's got,

37:26.619 --> 37:29.872
the world still looks at him
like it looks at me,

37:30.748 --> 37:31.582
not you.

37:31.666 --> 37:32.500
Oh, boy.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.419
I tell you,
I can see exactly what's been going on.

37:35.503 --> 37:38.172
I'm out of the house a few months,
and sure enough,

37:38.256 --> 37:39.382
you are filling his mind

37:39.465 --> 37:41.509
full of victimhood psychobabble.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.761
-Oh, you know what?
-"Pity me! Pity me!"

37:43.844 --> 37:45.471
-I've done nothing of the sort.
-[Scott] Yeah.

37:45.554 --> 37:47.056
Instead of pointing a finger at me,

37:47.139 --> 37:49.308
maybe you ought to be looking
in the mirror.

37:49.392 --> 37:50.476
Oh, this is my fault now?

37:50.559 --> 37:54.188
Well, you're the one who disappeared
at the pivotal moment in his life.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.314
Excuse me?

37:55.398 --> 37:57.275
You know exactly what I'm saying.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.819
I coached his baseball team for ten years.

37:59.902 --> 38:02.321
-Mmm.
-I went to every one of his concerts.

38:02.405 --> 38:03.990
Have I ever missed a banquet

38:04.073 --> 38:05.491
or a game or an event or a meet?

38:05.574 --> 38:08.077
-That's not what I'm talking about.
-What are you talking about?

38:08.160 --> 38:09.620
You walked out on him.

38:13.874 --> 38:14.792
I did not.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.294
-Yes, you did.
-Bullshit.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.420
-You did.
-No, I didn't.

38:17.503 --> 38:19.463
I'm sorry, but that is exactly what you--

38:19.547 --> 38:20.798
-[Scott] You know what?
-You did!

38:20.923 --> 38:22.133
You up and walked out on him.

38:22.216 --> 38:24.427
I didn't walk out on him.
I walked out on you.

38:31.517 --> 38:32.351
Oh.

38:32.935 --> 38:35.021
I didn't mean for it
to come out like that.

38:46.991 --> 38:47.825
I just--

38:48.784 --> 38:52.163
I'm so sick and tired of having
the same frickin' argument with you

38:52.246 --> 38:55.624
over and over and over again.
That is what I walked away from. Not--

38:56.751 --> 38:57.626
You know.

39:01.797 --> 39:03.758
Shit. Kenny, I'm sorry.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.092
-Stop.
-I didn't mean to...

39:05.176 --> 39:07.261
Just put the shovel down
and stop digging.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.473
Listen, J is on his way to being
a commissioned officer

39:10.556 --> 39:12.975
at one of the most elite institutions
on Earth.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.143
My job is done.

39:14.226 --> 39:15.644
He is a man now.

39:16.103 --> 39:17.355
A man I am so proud of.

39:17.438 --> 39:18.272
I know.

39:18.356 --> 39:22.610
So I cannot-- I cannot have you telling me
I didn't do my job as a father.

39:23.110 --> 39:23.986
Okay.

39:26.864 --> 39:28.824
-I am not your father, Kendra.
-[Kendra] Okay.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.951
-That's what walking out looks like.
-All right.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.119
-So don't. Don't.
-Scott.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.954
-Please. Please.
-I said I get it.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.001
[thunder rumbling]

39:56.727 --> 39:57.561
Hey.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.648
-[sobbing]
-[Scott] Kenny.

40:04.276 --> 40:06.070
Everything's gonna be fine, all right?

40:06.153 --> 40:08.114
-Let's just try and relax.
-[sighs]

40:08.739 --> 40:09.740
[shudders]

40:14.578 --> 40:17.748
This time of night, I always get agitated.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.585
You have no idea.

40:22.545 --> 40:25.464
I'm usually awake about this time.

40:25.548 --> 40:29.051
I don't know I've had a sleep-filled night
since that boy was born.

40:35.808 --> 40:39.937
<i>Most nights, my eyes fire wide open</i>
<i>out of a sound sleep.</i>

40:40.354 --> 40:44.358
<i>Heart beating so hard</i>
<i>I feel it throbbing in my ears.</i>

40:44.733 --> 40:46.694
<i>Always right about this time.</i>

40:49.822 --> 40:52.032
<i>Too late to go back to sleep...</i>

40:53.951 --> 40:55.995
<i>too early to get on with the day.</i>

40:56.078 --> 40:58.080
[siren wailing]

40:58.873 --> 41:00.332
[thunder rumbling]

41:00.499 --> 41:05.004
<i>You... just snoring away.</i>

41:11.969 --> 41:15.097
Usually, I go stand
in the door to his room...

41:18.142 --> 41:20.102
<i>and listen to him breathe.</i>

41:22.980 --> 41:28.277
Sometimes I go in and...
touch the muscle on his neck.

41:30.863 --> 41:32.239
Or shoulder.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.744
<i>Stand there and bullshit myself,</i>

41:36.827 --> 41:41.832
<i>"Don't worry, Kendra,</i>
<i>he is big and powerful.</i>

41:41.916 --> 41:43.375
This world can't hurt him."

41:46.045 --> 41:51.425
Until that nagging feeling comes back,
and I dwell on how fragile he is.

41:53.427 --> 41:56.263
<i>And whatever nightmare</i>
<i>that has just woke me up,</i>

41:56.347 --> 42:01.101
<i>someone texting in an SUV</i>
<i>or an errant punch in a bar fight,</i>

42:01.477 --> 42:03.479
<i>a ruptured appendix</i>

42:03.562 --> 42:06.232
in some third world country. Most...

42:06.315 --> 42:09.610
Most mothers can sit there in the dark
and get rational,

42:09.693 --> 42:10.736
go back to sleep.

42:10.819 --> 42:15.908
But sometimes, in my nightmares,
I see nooses and crosses

42:15.991 --> 42:19.286
and white men with Brylcreem crew cuts.

42:33.092 --> 42:37.846
Last summer... when Jamal
wanted to drive with Jeff to Bonnaroo,

42:37.930 --> 42:41.725
-I was-- I just...
-[Scott] No, look, J and I just thought

42:41.809 --> 42:43.978
you were a little over-the-top
with the mother hen thing,

42:44.061 --> 42:45.354
thinking he was too young.

42:45.437 --> 42:47.356
-Too young?
-[Scott] We disagreed and we moved on.

42:47.439 --> 42:49.108
Too young
had nothing to do with that shit.

42:49.191 --> 42:52.570
My granddaddy was fighting in Okinawa
when he was 17.

42:52.653 --> 42:53.862
Too <i>young?</i>

42:56.323 --> 42:57.449
It wasn't that.

42:58.742 --> 43:04.206
It was the prospect of him
driving  through the Deep South.

43:06.041 --> 43:09.712
My son, alone with a white boy

43:09.795 --> 43:12.965
driving Sherman's March to the Sea
in reverse.

43:15.551 --> 43:19.763
[sniffles] Maybe he and Jeff stopped
to get gas in some little town

43:19.847 --> 43:21.432
'cause he doesn't know any better

43:21.515 --> 43:25.227
because we raised him to believe
that the world is full-- [inhales sharply]

43:26.395 --> 43:27.855
full of goodness.

43:30.566 --> 43:35.279
And he starts batting his doe eyes
at some cute little white girl.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.534
Maybe the two of them walk
into a burger joint,

43:40.993 --> 43:43.203
happens to be an alt-right hangout.

43:46.665 --> 43:52.004
Maybe... some guy with a swastika
tattooed to his biceps

43:52.087 --> 43:54.298
had a little too much to drink, and...

43:55.883 --> 43:58.927
doesn't like the look...
[crying] of this boy

43:59.011 --> 44:02.389
who's poisoning
the country's racial purity.

44:03.307 --> 44:06.518
But the worst one,
the one that always comes back,

44:06.602 --> 44:10.439
is I see him getting stopped by a cop
for doing nothing in particular.

44:10.522 --> 44:13.192
<i>And I see ankle-high boots and...</i>

44:15.027 --> 44:16.070
badges...

44:19.073 --> 44:21.033
<i>and nightsticks.</i>

44:25.829 --> 44:28.332
And I think back on that night I was...

44:30.584 --> 44:32.294
five years old...

44:32.378 --> 44:36.632
and watched
my stoic mother doubled over,

44:37.174 --> 44:38.926
sobbing in the kitchen

44:39.009 --> 44:42.137
because Arthur McDuffie
had been beaten to death by the cops...

44:42.221 --> 44:44.682
[choking up]
...and they'd acquitted those cops.

44:49.061 --> 44:54.441
And you... [crying] were a little boy
asleep on the other side of town,

44:54.525 --> 44:56.819
dreaming of becoming one.

45:00.322 --> 45:01.949
[sobs] I'm scared.

45:02.032 --> 45:03.200
Don't be scared.

45:03.283 --> 45:04.118
-[Kendra] Yeah?
-Yeah.

45:04.201 --> 45:05.661
This is just some frivolous nonsense.

45:05.744 --> 45:07.621
They probably had
the music cranked up too loud.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.915
-You think?
-Yeah, you know how he likes to do.

45:10.749 --> 45:11.625
[scoffs]

45:12.626 --> 45:15.337
Or his buddies had a couple of beers
in the back seat, stupid shit,

45:15.421 --> 45:17.172
kids sowing wild oats.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.928
But let's not piss these people off, okay?

45:25.055 --> 45:25.889
Let's just...

45:27.266 --> 45:28.308
keep calm.

45:29.226 --> 45:31.770
Half an hour,
the three of us will be at Denny's...

45:33.605 --> 45:35.566
having a teachable moment.

45:42.030 --> 45:43.991
Have you talked to him recently?

45:44.450 --> 45:45.576
I talk to him every day.

45:45.659 --> 45:47.369
-Texting mostly, but...
-[Kendra] No.

45:47.453 --> 45:51.165
I mean, have you talked to him about...

45:51.248 --> 45:52.291
[Scott] About what?

45:53.333 --> 45:54.376
West Point.

45:55.627 --> 45:56.628
What about it?

45:57.254 --> 45:59.757
-I don't wanna get in the middle of this.
-[Scott] What about it?

46:01.550 --> 46:03.135
-Well, he's...
-[Scott] He's what?

46:03.218 --> 46:04.803
He's rethinking it.

46:06.388 --> 46:07.806
He's rethinking what?

46:10.017 --> 46:11.393
You should talk to him.

46:11.477 --> 46:12.770
About what, Kendra?

46:13.604 --> 46:14.438
[sighs]

46:15.230 --> 46:17.983
He's thinking about taking
the farm team contract.

46:18.817 --> 46:20.903
Or maybe seeing
where the guitar thing might go.

46:20.986 --> 46:21.987
Really?

46:22.070 --> 46:23.697
-Listen...
-Jesus Christ, Kenny. Again?

46:23.781 --> 46:26.033
It'd probably just be a deferment.
He's afraid to tell you.

46:26.116 --> 46:27.409
Yeah, well, he should be.

46:30.579 --> 46:31.747
I hope this wasn't your idea.

46:31.830 --> 46:33.791
-Okay, look.
-Are you encouraging this nonsense?

46:33.874 --> 46:36.335
He doesn't have the arm speed
to make it out of Double-A ball.

46:36.418 --> 46:37.961
He doesn't have the talent.

46:40.464 --> 46:42.716
A brutal reckoning that I, his father,

46:43.175 --> 46:45.385
not you, got to make with him, thank you.

46:45.469 --> 46:46.678
And the guitar?

46:47.346 --> 46:49.848
He's gonna, what?
Play the guitar, like, for a living?

46:49.932 --> 46:52.100
Just because you were too scared
to pursue your dreams,

46:52.184 --> 46:53.685
-don't take it out on him.
-Oh, please.

46:53.769 --> 46:54.895
Let him try while he's young.

46:55.562 --> 46:58.190
At worst,
he spends some time finding himself.

46:58.273 --> 47:00.275
Oh, sure.
You kick around trying to "find yourself,"

47:00.359 --> 47:02.444
and before you know it,
you're a 40-year-old dude

47:02.528 --> 47:05.572
with a 150 IQ and no college degree.

47:07.115 --> 47:11.370
Then you're making, what, 450 a week
in a goddamn wedding cover band.

47:12.329 --> 47:13.831
Being hired by a guy

47:13.914 --> 47:16.124
who can afford to drop $100K
on the wedding

47:16.208 --> 47:18.252
because he didn't waste
ten years of his life

47:18.335 --> 47:20.879
pursuing his dreams of, you know,
the Olympic curling team,

47:20.963 --> 47:23.048
or writing the next great American novel.

47:23.131 --> 47:25.133
-That's not what I meant.
-The men in my family have

47:25.217 --> 47:27.469
served this country every generation
since they got here.

47:27.553 --> 47:29.304
He is not entitled
to break that tradition.

47:29.388 --> 47:30.639
-Scott.
-It's not an option.

47:30.722 --> 47:32.307
-End of discussion.
-[door closes]

47:32.391 --> 47:33.725
[Larkin] Sorry to interrupt.

47:34.101 --> 47:36.019
Coffee. No cream, no sugar.

47:36.103 --> 47:37.646
-[Scott] Thanks.
-[lock screen clicks]

47:37.729 --> 47:39.940
So, I got some more information for you.

47:40.023 --> 47:40.899
It's not a lot.

47:41.775 --> 47:43.777
I checked the computer intake log again.

47:44.444 --> 47:45.571
[clears throat]

47:46.655 --> 47:50.200
Your son was identified
as a vehicle occupant

47:50.284 --> 47:52.119
in a traffic stop in your Lexus.

47:52.202 --> 47:55.956
I also confirmed there were
two other black males

47:56.039 --> 47:57.833
in the vehicle when it was stopped.

47:57.916 --> 47:59.042
Why were they stopped?

47:59.126 --> 48:00.669
The log's not really that specific.

48:00.752 --> 48:02.713
The general "infraction" category
was checked off.

48:02.796 --> 48:04.047
What does that mean?

48:04.756 --> 48:06.967
It's just whatever
the patrol officer logged in

48:07.050 --> 48:09.177
from his laptop in the patrol car.

48:09.261 --> 48:10.470
He, like, checks off a box.

48:10.554 --> 48:11.930
So this tells us nothing.

48:12.014 --> 48:15.058
Well, it's not showing up
as a pursuit following felony,

48:15.434 --> 48:17.728
a stolen car, BOLO.
You know, the really bad stuff...

48:17.811 --> 48:19.271
-Okay.
-...you can check off.

48:19.354 --> 48:22.608
-[Scott] Who were the other boys?
-Yeah, I'm not allowed to, um...

48:25.444 --> 48:28.113
Okay, this stays between us.
Badge to badge.

48:31.033 --> 48:33.994
DaShawn Rolle and Jarvis Bell.

48:34.077 --> 48:34.953
You know them?

48:35.871 --> 48:38.665
Uh, Bell is a 20-year-old
with misdemeanor convictions.

48:38.749 --> 48:39.875
He had an open warrant.

48:39.958 --> 48:41.418
-For what?
-That I cannot tell you.

48:41.501 --> 48:43.295
You see, Ken? Do you see what I'm saying?

48:43.378 --> 48:45.213
Um, one other thing.

48:45.297 --> 48:47.925
I gave your son's social media accounts
a quick look over.

48:48.008 --> 48:51.470
Really? That's what you've been doing
while we're standing around in here?

48:51.553 --> 48:54.640
Social media is, like, the first stop
in missing persons cases.

48:54.723 --> 48:55.682
-Oh, please.
-Fact!

48:59.019 --> 49:01.480
And that I did learn in a training video.

49:05.776 --> 49:08.445
Your son posted something on Instagram.

49:08.862 --> 49:12.199
A photo of a bumper sticker
on the back of your Lexus.

49:14.076 --> 49:18.789
"Shoot cops with your camera phone
whenever they make a bust."

49:19.581 --> 49:21.333
-Excuse me?
-That is what it says.

49:21.416 --> 49:23.043
-"Shoot cops"?
-Yeah, yeah.

49:23.126 --> 49:26.046
And those words
were in, like, huge letters, okay?

49:26.129 --> 49:28.340
-I think you're mistaken.
-The rest of it in little fonts,

49:28.423 --> 49:30.884
so all anyone who wasn't two feet away
from the bumper could see

49:30.968 --> 49:32.636
is a Lexus that says, "Shoot cops."

49:32.719 --> 49:35.180
No... [chuckling] No, not my son.

49:35.263 --> 49:36.515
[sniffles]

49:38.725 --> 49:39.643
Afraid so.

49:53.573 --> 49:54.866
"Shoot cops."

49:54.950 --> 49:56.743
Shoot people just trying to do their jobs.

49:56.827 --> 49:57.953
-That's all you can see?
-Yup.

49:58.036 --> 50:00.330
-Jesus Christ.
-Shoot people with wives and kids.

50:00.414 --> 50:01.331
Son of a bitch.

50:01.415 --> 50:04.584
Just shoot 'em 'cause you're part
of the revolution or whatever, I guess.

50:04.668 --> 50:05.669
-Kendra.
-What?

50:05.752 --> 50:08.130
-That car is registered in my name.
-God...

50:08.213 --> 50:11.299
This isn't about us, remember?
Our son is in police custody.

50:11.383 --> 50:14.469
Our son has a bumper sticker
on his car that says, "Shoot cops."

50:14.553 --> 50:16.054
-My son. I'm the cops.
-[Kendra] Scott.

50:16.138 --> 50:19.224
-God damn it. I'm the cops!
-This is about a camera phone.

50:20.517 --> 50:21.351
Jesus, Scott!

50:21.435 --> 50:23.562
Right now, I couldn't care less
about you and him

50:23.645 --> 50:25.022
and your goddamn thin blue line.

50:25.105 --> 50:26.481
I care about finding our son.

50:26.565 --> 50:28.442
Did you know about this? Had you seen it?

50:28.525 --> 50:30.610
Kenny, please tell me
that you didn't know about this.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.863
-Please tell me that you didn't--
-Listen to me.

50:34.239 --> 50:36.867
There are three black kids in his school.

50:37.242 --> 50:40.037
Three out of 400 and something.

50:40.120 --> 50:42.581
And the other two are dating each other.

50:42.664 --> 50:44.041
-He's...
-Oh, no, I totally get it.

50:44.124 --> 50:45.500
Being one of the only black kids

50:45.584 --> 50:47.753
at the most expensive prep school
in the city...

50:48.587 --> 50:50.756
versus being a black kid at,
you know, MLK Senior,

50:50.839 --> 50:52.841
where you gotta go through metal detectors
every day,

50:52.924 --> 50:56.344
that entitles you to put a bumper sticker
on your Lexus

50:56.428 --> 50:59.431
that says, "Shoot the stupid dumbass
who bought me this car."

50:59.514 --> 51:02.100
He is grappling with a lot right now.

51:02.934 --> 51:04.936
-He's depressed.
-Oh, Jesus.

51:05.020 --> 51:06.063
He's confused.

51:06.146 --> 51:09.316
Bullshit. Look, I'm sorry to be venting
like this in front of you.

51:09.399 --> 51:11.151
Oh, no, listen, I totally hear you.

51:11.234 --> 51:12.736
Where is Jamal now?

51:13.320 --> 51:16.031
What I just told you,
that is all that is in the system,

51:16.114 --> 51:17.991
and I wasn't even supposed
to tell you that.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.242
I'm really supposed to wait

51:19.326 --> 51:21.411
for this Lieutenant Stokes guy
to get here.

51:22.287 --> 51:25.332
But, I tell you what,
I will go and check the computer again,

51:25.415 --> 51:27.125
see if someone might have
logged something in

51:27.209 --> 51:28.460
in the last few minutes.

51:30.796 --> 51:31.922
[Kendra] You know what?

51:32.047 --> 51:34.132
I sat around here almost half an hour.

51:34.216 --> 51:36.343
You couldn't tell me a damn thing.

51:36.718 --> 51:38.303
Except for maybe how to go on

51:38.386 --> 51:40.847
a self-guided, Jim Crow tour
through the building...

51:40.931 --> 51:44.810
And then as soon as my husband shows up,
my white husband,

51:44.893 --> 51:46.978
suddenly you are as helpful as can be.

51:47.062 --> 51:48.438
-[Scott] Kendra!
-Why is that?

51:49.314 --> 51:52.025
Do you not want me to go look
at the computer again?

51:52.109 --> 51:54.194
-[Kendra huffs]
-If you wouldn't mind too much.

51:54.277 --> 51:56.113
I'm sorry, I didn't get your first name.

51:56.947 --> 51:57.781
Paul.

51:57.864 --> 52:00.325
Paul, if you wouldn't mind,
we'd really appreciate it.

52:01.451 --> 52:02.410
Sure thing.

52:04.079 --> 52:05.956
-Refill?
-That'd be great.

52:15.132 --> 52:16.049
"That'd be great."

52:17.259 --> 52:18.844
You know what else would be great?

52:18.927 --> 52:20.929
If you took my side at some point.

52:21.012 --> 52:22.264
Damn it, Kendra.

52:22.347 --> 52:24.349
You're so goddamn nice to him,
it's making me sick.

52:24.432 --> 52:27.060
-"Shoot cops"? For Christ's sake.
-That's why you're kissing this guy's ass?

52:27.144 --> 52:29.312
No. I'm ready to put my fist
through the goddamn wall.

52:29.396 --> 52:30.522
Put yourself in Jamal's place.

52:30.605 --> 52:33.150
-Oh, give me a break.
-No! Just for one minute,

52:33.233 --> 52:36.278
put yourself in your son's place.

52:42.242 --> 52:44.411
He is the only black person

52:44.494 --> 52:47.122
most of those little white kids
at his school know.

52:48.081 --> 52:49.166
Most of 'em...

52:50.500 --> 52:53.628
only black people
they've ever exchanged two words with

52:53.712 --> 52:57.382
are the Jamaican hospice woman
who wipes bubbie's ass,

52:57.757 --> 53:00.385
and the people
at some Habitat for Humanity house

53:00.468 --> 53:02.137
they helped build
just so they had something

53:02.220 --> 53:03.805
to put on their application to Princeton.

53:03.889 --> 53:05.682
-Look, I get that.
-You have to understand, Scott.

53:05.765 --> 53:07.517
Jamal is going through...

53:15.817 --> 53:17.027
an awakening.

53:17.527 --> 53:18.987
-An awakening? To what?
-[Kendra] Yes.

53:19.070 --> 53:20.155
To this.

53:39.007 --> 53:39.841
Okay.

53:41.718 --> 53:43.470
And? [exhales]

53:44.221 --> 53:45.180
And...

53:46.598 --> 53:48.683
Philando Castile.

53:50.644 --> 53:52.020
And Eric Garner.

53:53.355 --> 53:55.023
And Tamir Rice.

53:56.107 --> 53:57.943
Every time it happens,

53:58.026 --> 54:00.779
he feels the world
close in on him a little.

54:00.862 --> 54:03.073
And it's coming at him from both sides

54:03.156 --> 54:07.369
because all of his white friends
think he represents the entire race.

54:07.452 --> 54:11.706
It's not like if he was at a school
with other black kids he could lean on.

54:11.790 --> 54:14.459
He is the one all the white kids look to.

54:14.542 --> 54:17.796
There is <i>immense</i> pressure on him to--

54:18.505 --> 54:21.758
[chuckles] I'll tell you what he calls it,
"the face of the race."

54:23.635 --> 54:27.847
That's what he says,
"I feel like I am the face of the race."

54:28.848 --> 54:30.809
-He told you this?
-[Kendra] Many times.

54:32.310 --> 54:34.271
He never said anything like that to me.

54:38.149 --> 54:39.985
Baby, look at you...

54:40.652 --> 54:43.196
and look at me
and reckon why that might be.

54:48.535 --> 54:50.870
When these men get shot down,

54:50.954 --> 54:53.331
he can feel their ghosts.

54:55.333 --> 54:57.002
That bumper sticker was--

54:58.295 --> 54:59.587
Was what?

55:01.381 --> 55:02.966
No, really, I--I...

55:04.301 --> 55:06.469
-I want to understand.
-[sobbing]

55:07.012 --> 55:08.179
[groans]

55:09.472 --> 55:10.640
[chuckling]

55:15.228 --> 55:19.316
Can you see that Jamal
is also right, here?

55:20.775 --> 55:23.236
Filming cops is all these kids have.

55:23.320 --> 55:25.238
It is their last line of defense.

55:25.322 --> 55:28.867
Shit. God forbid I'm stopped,
it's mine too.

55:28.950 --> 55:31.077
That is the world we live in.

55:31.161 --> 55:32.662
Whether you get it or not.

55:36.082 --> 55:38.209
[thunder rumbling]

55:41.338 --> 55:42.881
No, I get it. I do.

55:45.216 --> 55:46.134
I get it.

55:48.386 --> 55:49.262
I just--

55:52.223 --> 55:55.143
He still should've known
where this kind of thing can lead.

55:55.226 --> 55:56.061
Where?

55:56.644 --> 55:58.438
Here? [sniffles]

55:58.521 --> 55:59.481
-Tonight?
-Yeah.

55:59.564 --> 56:00.982
-Because of a bumper sticker?
-Yes.

56:01.066 --> 56:02.692
You really think
that's what this is about?

56:02.776 --> 56:04.194
-Sure didn't help.
-A bumper sticker?

56:04.277 --> 56:06.821
Look, if I'm a cop rolling down the street
at 2:00 a.m.,

56:06.905 --> 56:08.782
and it's a close call on probable cause...

56:08.865 --> 56:10.867
The bumper sticker would push you
over the edge?

56:10.950 --> 56:12.369
-You bet.
-Oh... [chuckling]

56:12.452 --> 56:14.913
Especially, if after I make
a warning stop,

56:14.996 --> 56:18.208
I got some uppity asshole
lecturing me about his rights.

56:18.291 --> 56:19.584
[whispering] Son of a bitch.

56:20.001 --> 56:21.002
What?

56:23.171 --> 56:24.172
"Uppity"?

56:25.965 --> 56:27.759
-Oh, come on.
-Is that what you just said?

56:27.842 --> 56:29.344
-[Scott] Kendra, please.
-Unbelievable.

56:29.427 --> 56:30.720
-[Scott] Jesus Christ.
-From you?

56:30.804 --> 56:32.097
I don't even know what to say.

56:32.180 --> 56:35.642
God damn it, don't make this about
how I tripped on some coded word fossil.

56:40.897 --> 56:43.858
I cannot have J lapsing into a life

56:43.942 --> 56:46.569
where he makes excuses for himself
all the time. I won't.

56:46.653 --> 56:49.239
And I won't have him walking around
apologizing for who he is.

56:49.322 --> 56:51.950
-No one is asking him to do that.
-Yes, they are.

56:55.745 --> 56:58.081
"Keep your hands on the wheel, boy.
Look straight ahead.

56:58.164 --> 57:00.125
Don't make any sudden moves.

57:00.208 --> 57:04.087
Wouldn't want to make the man
in the bulletproof vest nervous

57:04.170 --> 57:08.383
when he walks up to your window
pointing a glock at your head."

57:12.220 --> 57:14.013
Your father ever tell you that?

57:14.931 --> 57:17.475
-He never had to.
-You're goddamn right, he didn't.

57:21.938 --> 57:24.482
-[rain pattering]
-[thunder rumbling]

57:32.574 --> 57:33.867
Look, Kenny.

57:38.455 --> 57:41.458
I'm as eager to sort this out as you are.
He is my son, too.

57:43.001 --> 57:44.794
I just don't think that, you know,

57:45.503 --> 57:48.882
lecturing these people
on Black Lives Matter is gonna help.

57:50.467 --> 57:51.801
Let's try...

57:53.219 --> 57:55.138
catching flies with honey, okay?

57:55.221 --> 57:57.098
Maybe they need a little lecture.

57:58.266 --> 58:01.186
They sure fittin' to get one
when I sue their asses.

58:01.686 --> 58:02.854
Look, alls I'm saying...

58:02.937 --> 58:03.813
<i>all...</i>

58:05.231 --> 58:06.483
all I'm saying...

58:06.858 --> 58:09.068
is let's give these people
the benefit of the doubt

58:09.152 --> 58:12.071
and not act like we're
in some ass-backwards Klan county

58:12.155 --> 58:14.491
in South Carolina.
This is Miami, for God's sake.

58:14.574 --> 58:17.327
Where my black, PhD-having ass

58:17.410 --> 58:20.622
still has to drive down
something called "South Dixie Highway"

58:20.705 --> 58:21.998
to get to work every day.

58:22.081 --> 58:24.626
Kenny, I see your point. I do.

58:26.127 --> 58:28.213
But throwing all that up
in white people's faces

58:28.296 --> 58:29.464
makes them feel like shit.

58:29.547 --> 58:32.467
And when you make people feel like shit,
they tend to not wanna help you.

58:32.550 --> 58:34.052
[Southern accent]
Yes, sir, Massa Scott.

58:34.135 --> 58:36.471
Auntie Kendra don't wanna hurt
nobody feelings.

58:36.554 --> 58:38.348
I sorry, Massa Scott.

58:38.431 --> 58:40.850
[laughing]

58:43.353 --> 58:44.729
What is so funny?

58:46.189 --> 58:47.607
[coughs, clears throat]

58:48.566 --> 58:49.442
You.

58:51.110 --> 58:52.737
Being ridiculous.

58:52.820 --> 58:54.322
[laughing]

58:54.822 --> 58:57.951
My husband laughs
when I pretend to be a house slave,

58:58.034 --> 59:01.120
-and I wonder why we're separated.
-[Scott] Oh, Jesus.

59:03.039 --> 59:06.960
Boy. I tell you,
did you and I ever agree on anything?

59:07.043 --> 59:09.170
-Oh, come on.
-No, did we?

59:09.254 --> 59:10.547
Seriously?

59:13.758 --> 59:15.051
Seriously?

59:27.021 --> 59:28.898
The importance of hard work.

59:30.817 --> 59:31.859
Frugality.

59:34.529 --> 59:36.489
Respect for our elders.

59:39.826 --> 59:42.120
Bourbon Manhattans at dusk
out on the patio.

59:42.203 --> 59:43.830
-Okay.
-[chuckles softly]

59:45.456 --> 59:47.292
-Thelonious Monk. Right?
-Mmm.

59:47.375 --> 59:49.294
Yeah. We always agreed on Thelonious Monk.

59:49.377 --> 59:50.461
Yes, we did.

59:53.423 --> 59:54.382
Thai food.

59:56.718 --> 59:57.635
-Right.
-The U.

59:57.719 --> 59:59.846
[laughing] Yes.

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:02.181
[chuckles]

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:04.684
-Cormac McCarthy.
-Mmm. [chuckles]

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:06.019
The Cayman Islands.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:07.687
Sex.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:09.522
Yeah.

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:37.091
The morning J was born
was the best day of our lives.

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:39.469
-We definitely agree on that.
-Right?

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:53.566
I mean, I still can't.

01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:59.113
I just can't...

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:03.534
I mean, Jesus Christ.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:08.289
[sighs]

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:12.043
When I was at that conference in Atlanta
a couple months ago,

01:01:12.126 --> 01:01:14.212
I saw another bumper sticker,

01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:17.590
"Don't Blame Me,
I Voted for Jefferson Davis."

01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:19.592
Nobody was pulling him over.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.803
That's just some bigoted asshole, Kenny.

01:01:21.886 --> 01:01:23.012
But in Atlanta.

01:01:23.262 --> 01:01:25.723
In the capital of black America,

01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:28.935
white people get to glue their anger
all over their car bumpers.

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:31.938
Well, I cannot answer
for every racist white person.

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:34.107
No? You're not the "face of the race"?

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:35.191
[scoffs]

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.486
Well, I'm glad to see that this is
the standard we're holding our son to.

01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:39.821
What standard is that?

01:01:39.904 --> 01:01:41.572
Looking for a bigot behind every tree.

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:43.324
Because that's what this shit leads to.

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:46.077
"Shoot cops" bumper stickers
and all this micro-aggression bullshit...

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.745
-Can we drop it?
-...on college campuses.

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:50.206
I mean, seriously, Kendra,
what were you thinking?

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:52.041
He just put it on the car today
or yesterday,

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.292
I'm losing track of time here.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:55.837
-So you did know it was there?
-Scott, yes, I saw it.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:57.964
I didn't like it either,

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:00.508
but Jamal has been on edge
about everything lately.

01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:03.344
You weren't around.
It was up to me to do triage.

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:06.472
I decided the bumper sticker was a battle
that could wait till morning.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:09.308
I-- I told him not to get in that car
until he got rid of it.

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.060
Okay. Fine. But once this is done,

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:12.854
we're gonna sit down,
have a little chat

01:02:12.937 --> 01:02:15.231
about the quality of your judgment
on this.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:18.735
Wow.

01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:20.737
Okay.

01:02:21.487 --> 01:02:22.363
You know what?

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:24.782
I'm not running cover for you anymore.

01:02:25.616 --> 01:02:28.911
He put the bumper sticker on the car
to get back at you.

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:32.290
He's furious with you.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:33.916
What? For what?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.376
What do you think, Scott?

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.961
For leaving him.

01:02:37.044 --> 01:02:38.588
Sorry, leaving <i>me.</i>

01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:40.298
-He told you this?
-Told me...

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:43.468
I had to watch my six-foot tall son

01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:46.721
cry his eyes dry
about three nights running.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:49.056
Calling you names
they haven't invented yet.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:53.269
That poor child was curled up in my arms
like a little baby.

01:02:53.352 --> 01:02:55.354
-I... I...
-I...

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:58.775
Yeah. That's what all this is about.
The bumper sticker. The cornrows.

01:02:58.858 --> 01:03:00.359
-It is a rebellion against you.
-No. No.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.361
-Bullshit.
-No, honey. It's not bullshit.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.822
It's called
the science of human psychology.

01:03:05.364 --> 01:03:08.159
This is what young men do

01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:13.706
when the person they have modeled
their whole identity and moral code over--

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:16.083
Hell, what is the clinical term?

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:17.835
-"Fucks over his family."
-Kenny...

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:19.212
[Kendra] He hates you right now!

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:22.715
And for the first time in his life,
he hates being half-white!

01:03:30.556 --> 01:03:31.641
I told you,

01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:34.602
I am not happy
about the goddamn bumper sticker

01:03:34.685 --> 01:03:36.687
or the cornrows or the baggy pants,

01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:39.816
but it is just a phase he will get over.
Hopefully a short one.

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:45.822
I am just trying to help him reassemble
a very fragile identity,

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:50.701
an identity that you busted into pieces
when you walked out that door.

01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:52.370
So get off my back about this

01:03:52.453 --> 01:03:54.413
because you don't get
to take the high road here.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:55.373
-Stop it.
-[phone chimes]

01:03:55.456 --> 01:03:56.457
No! You--

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:58.334
[lock screen clicks]

01:03:58.417 --> 01:03:59.919
It's not J. Fuck.

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:01.838
You really need to be texting her now?

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:02.964
-It's my brother.
-What?

01:04:03.047 --> 01:04:05.299
-He sent a link, he said it's urgent.
-Dwyane Wade dunking?

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:08.094
You two can't bond over your man crush
some other time?

01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:12.765
[man] <i> Aw, man. Aw, man.</i>

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.976
-[man 2] <i> Don't do it, man.</i>
-[man 3] <i> Nigga, stay down.</i>

01:04:15.059 --> 01:04:16.102

01:04:18.604 --> 01:04:20.398
[gunshots firing]

01:04:21.607 --> 01:04:22.525
Jesus.

01:04:22.608 --> 01:04:23.734
Scott, what is that?

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:24.735
It's, um...

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:26.362
I-- I don't...

01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:29.490
-Uh...
-Scott?

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:32.368
-I-- No. Nope. No, honey?
-Yes.

01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:35.371
Kendra, stop it.
God damn it, honey, please don't.

01:04:36.747 --> 01:04:39.667
[man] <i>Aw, man. Aw, man.</i>

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:41.878
-[man 2] <i>Don't do it, man.</i>

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:46.549
-[gunshots firing]
-[gasps]

01:04:46.632 --> 01:04:47.466
Okay.

01:04:49.093 --> 01:04:49.927
Jesus.

01:04:54.765 --> 01:04:55.641
What...

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:58.352
-What's it mean?
-I don't know.

01:05:00.521 --> 01:05:02.273
-Is that Jamal?
-Jesus.

01:05:02.356 --> 01:05:03.733
-Scott, is that him?
-I don't know.

01:05:03.816 --> 01:05:05.109
Is that him?

01:05:05.192 --> 01:05:06.819
No, Kendra, I don't know.
Give me a second.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.947
-Well, what does the text say?
-I wasn't paying attention. Um...

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:13.826
"Look ASAP, AM stringer posted this
on the CBS4 site. Is this J?"

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.328
Let me see. Let me see it.

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:18.247
-[indistinct yelling on phone]
-[man] <i>Aw, man.</i>

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:19.916
Scott, I think that's him.

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:21.667
Is that him? The one running?

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.794
-Kendra.
-No-- No, God. In the blue shirt.

01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:25.671
-[man 3] <i> Stay down, nigga.</i>
-I think that's his shirt.

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.632
Let's just take this
one step at a time, okay?

01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:29.216
-Okay.
-I'm gonna call my brother at the station.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.801
-I wanna see it again, make sure.
-Give me a second.

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:32.845
Let me get a hold of my brother,
see if he knows anything.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.138
Hey, John. It's me.

01:05:34.555 --> 01:05:35.932
So is that J in the...?

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:41.896
-Well, did he say whether or not he...
-What did he say?

01:05:44.815 --> 01:05:45.691
Okay.

01:05:47.151 --> 01:05:49.028
Well, can you text me his number
so that I can...

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.571
-Who? Who is he?
-You don't? Okay.

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:51.906
-[John] <i>All right?</i>
-Yeah. Thanks.

01:05:51.989 --> 01:05:53.074
What did he say?

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:56.118
Just that the police station monitors,
the-- the police scanner,

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:58.537
and they heard reports
of a warrant stop, a traffic stop,

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:01.749
and a witness, a bystander,
some guy happens to be there

01:06:01.832 --> 01:06:02.959
and he sends in this footage.

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:05.252
-Is it Jamal? Was he hurt?
-John doesn't know.

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:07.964
Just that the chatter came back
with my car, and he sent the link.

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:09.256
-He doesn't know.
-Wait.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.509
It could be him, Scott. He could be hurt.

01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:12.969
Jamal could be hurt.

01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:14.220
-We have to...
-I don't know.

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:16.138
I saw what you saw, okay? I mean, I--

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:17.223
-Hey!
-I got your refill.

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:18.349
-Have you seen this?
-Huh?

01:06:18.432 --> 01:06:19.725
Have you seen this?

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.602
No-- No. Seen what?

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.066
[indistinct yelling]

01:06:27.191 --> 01:06:30.152
[man] <i>Aw, man. Aw, man.</i>

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:32.238
-[man 2] <i>Don't do it, man.</i>
-[man 3] <i>Nigga, stay down.</i>

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:33.406
[man 2] <i>Don't do it, man!</i>

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:35.658
[man 3] <i>Stay down, nigga.</i>

01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:37.660
-[gunshots firing]
-[gasps]

01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:40.037
I want to know
what's going on with my son, now.

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:41.664
I don't know what this is.

01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:43.499
It's a video.
Apparently from a traffic stop.

01:06:43.582 --> 01:06:44.792
What video, from what stop?

01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:46.877
The stop where--
I don't know, that's why I'm asking.

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:48.921
Our son and other kids, we think.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:51.048
-Where did you get it?
-Forget about where we got it.

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:53.384
I'm trying to understand why you think
this has to do with your son.

01:06:53.467 --> 01:06:55.928
His brother sent it
and thinks it could be Jamal.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:57.555
Forget about all that. Where is our son?

01:06:57.638 --> 01:06:59.015
We just wanna know if he's okay.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:02.059
Look, I told you, Lieutenant Stokes
is on his way down here.

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:03.185
He'll be able to tell you.

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:04.645
Okay. Listen to me. I have been--

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:06.605
We have been waiting
and we've been patient.

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.567
But our son is in custody, your custody.
You have him.

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:12.194
We would like to know where he is.
We would like to talk to him.

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:13.863
-[Larkin] I understand.
-We want to talk to him.

01:07:13.946 --> 01:07:15.823
-[Larkin] I'm doing everything I can.
-[Scott] This is easy!

01:07:15.906 --> 01:07:17.366
I'm gonna make this very easy for you.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:20.703
I wanna know where my son is right now!
I wanna talk to him.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.206
Okay. As I have explained,

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:27.084
I am not authorized to tell you that.

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:30.337
All right? I think that
if we all just calm down here for a second

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:31.630
and stop jumping to conclusions--

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:33.049
-Oh, God!
-Where is my son?

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:35.051
[shouting] Where is my son?

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:37.595
Sir, you just committed a battery
on a law enforcement officer.

01:07:37.678 --> 01:07:39.889
-That is a second-degree felony.
-Listen to me, you little shit.

01:07:39.972 --> 01:07:41.515
If you don't tell me
where my son is right now,

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:45.061
I'm gonna commit a capital felony.
We are done being strung along!

01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:46.062
-[Kendra] Scott.
-[man] Sir!

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:48.647
I'm gonna ask, please,
take a seat and calm down.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:49.607
-Who are you?
-Sir, please.

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:50.775
Take your fuckin' hands off me.

01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:54.195
-I'm gonna ask you nice one more time.
-Sorry, who the fuck is this?

01:07:54.278 --> 01:07:56.072
Officer, your cuffs, please.

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:58.199
-You have the right to remain silent.
-You kidding me?

01:07:58.282 --> 01:08:00.367
[man] Anything you do or say
may be used against you...

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:02.453
-You're kidding.
-You have the right to consult an attorney

01:08:02.536 --> 01:08:04.080
-before speaking with police.
-You kidding?

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:05.623
-[man] Afraid not.
-Why am I arrested?

01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:07.041
You have the right to an attorney...

01:08:07.124 --> 01:08:09.335
-What is happening?
-You are kidding me.

01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:11.128
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:13.547
free of charge before any questioning,
if you wish.

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:14.507
If you decide-- Stop.

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.801
Listen to me. You wanna keep on
racking up charges

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:19.678
-or calm down and get this over with?
-Just don't fucking touch me.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:21.680
Officer, give me a hand.
Turn and face the wall.

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:23.057
-I'm not gonna turn--
-Don't resist.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:25.309
-Take your goddamn hands off me.
-[Larkin] Sir!

01:08:25.392 --> 01:08:27.019
-[Scott] Take your hands off me!
-Stop it.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.729
-Let me go.
-Stop it. No!

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:31.649
-Let me go!
-He has a heart murmur.

01:08:31.732 --> 01:08:33.859
-Sit him down.
-He has a heart murmur!

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.861
Son of a bitch. Fuck.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.238
-Hey.
-[Kendra crying]

01:08:37.321 --> 01:08:39.198
What is wrong with you people?

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:40.908
-That's enough.
-What is wrong with you?

01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:42.993
I said that's enough. You injured?

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:45.162
-Uh...
-Are you injured?

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:47.497
-Well, he certainly could have been.
-[man] Sir?

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:50.126
Get pictures of him. His face and hands.

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:51.210
Yours and mine, too.

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:53.796
Was that at all necessary?

01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:56.715
-Unfortunately, it was.
-[camera shutter snapping]

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:59.426
Now, we all calm?

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:02.555
We all settled down?

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:07.475
Good. My name is Lieutenant John Stokes.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.520
I'm the AM shift liaison officer.

01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:11.063
I understand there was an incident.

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:12.648
-We wanna know where our son is.
-Quiet.

01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:14.399
We wanna know now.
We wanna know <i>right now.</i>

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:16.527
Okay, I'm gonna try this one more time.

01:09:16.609 --> 01:09:18.154
I don't wanna take you into custody.

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:20.072
I'd hate to see you lose
that badge and pension

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:21.615
I'm sure you've worked very hard for.

01:09:21.698 --> 01:09:23.283
I have a right to know
where my son is.

01:09:23.367 --> 01:09:25.161
You're mistaken.
You have no such right, sir.

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:28.622
Your son is an adult
who's the subject of an investigation.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:32.209
Right now, you have the right
to sit down and shut up.

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:33.669
-Do you understand?
-He understands.

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:35.254
I'm talking to him. Do you understand?

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.173
-Fuck you!
-Scott, please.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:39.008
-Take him up to intake and book him.
-No.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:41.093
Two counts battery
on a law enforcement officer,

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.720
two counts resisting with violence.

01:09:42.803 --> 01:09:46.849
And every time he so much as flinches
or looks at you cross-eyed

01:09:46.932 --> 01:09:48.809
between now and being fingerprinted,

01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:50.728
add a charge of resisting without. Got it?

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:51.812
Yes, sir.

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:53.439
Do I take him into custody?

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:56.483
If he can calm himself, give him
a "promise to appear" and cut him loose.

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:57.526
You people are animals.

01:09:57.610 --> 01:10:00.654
Do I need to call in a taser and backup,
or you gonna hold it together?

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:01.822
-I'm fine.
-[Stokes] All right.

01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:04.700
-And you'll be hearing from my lawyer.
-And you'll be hearing from mine.

01:10:04.783 --> 01:10:06.452
My lawyer's name is the state attorney.

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:08.120
What's your lawyer's name?

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:10.331
Get him out of here.

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.219
Now, again...

01:10:23.802 --> 01:10:26.096
my name is Lieutenant John Stokes.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.849
I would very much like to know
if my son is okay.

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:32.019
If you will be still, I will tell you
everything I currently know.

01:10:32.102 --> 01:10:34.021
I will not be lectured

01:10:34.104 --> 01:10:36.398
and this will not devolve
into a shouting match.

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.400
When did I ever shout at you?

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:39.401
Ma'am...

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:42.905
Fine.

01:10:42.988 --> 01:10:44.573
I will tell you what I know.

01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:47.451
You will quietly and politely listen,

01:10:47.534 --> 01:10:49.662
or I will simply walk out that door

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:52.331
and you can find out what it is
you want to know in due course.

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:53.540
Understood?

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:57.836
Who is your supervisor?

01:11:02.841 --> 01:11:04.176
Sorry, understood.

01:11:05.886 --> 01:11:06.804
Excuse me?

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.603
I said "understood."

01:11:15.854 --> 01:11:16.730
Good.

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:18.607
This is what I know.

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:22.736
At approximately 02:15 this morning,

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:26.782
a late model silver Lexus was pulled over
by a patrol officer.

01:11:27.157 --> 01:11:30.119
That Lexus is registered
to a Scott Alan Connor.

01:11:30.202 --> 01:11:31.453
That's my husband.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:34.832
Three African-American males
have been taken into police custody

01:11:34.915 --> 01:11:36.292
in connection with the incident.

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:38.210
We don't know much more
about the stop except...

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:39.878
-The cop shot at someone.
-I won't compete

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:42.631
-with your outrage and speculation.
-I saw a video.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:44.341
There were shots fired.

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:47.886
-I don't have confirmation of that.
-But I heard it.

01:11:48.512 --> 01:11:49.847
[voice cracking] I heard it.

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:53.809
You heard noises on a grainy video.
I'm trying to get facts.

01:11:53.892 --> 01:11:55.936
He called one of the kids a nigger.

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.396
If you'll let me finish...

01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:59.606
He called him a nigger.
I saw it. I heard it.

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:01.150
-No, ma'am.
<i>-You</i> saw it!

01:12:01.233 --> 01:12:02.151
Incorrect.

01:12:02.234 --> 01:12:05.279
One of the people taken into custody
was a bystander,

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.072
a black bystander,

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.366
who shot that footage with his cell phone.

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:11.201
It's his voice you hear on the video.

01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:13.287
Not the voice
of a law enforcement officer.

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.090
[choking up]

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:28.427
Why was Jamal stopped?
He-- He doesn't drink.

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:31.638
We just bought the car.
The brake lights were working.

01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:33.265
-Ma'am--
-He had his registration

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:34.600
and insurance card with him.

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:36.310
-I made sure of that.
-Ma'am.

01:12:36.393 --> 01:12:38.604
He wouldn't have given anyone
any reason to stop him.

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:41.440
No one has said your son was stopped.

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:44.985
There are at least three individuals
involved in this incident.

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:49.406
I don't know who was driving the vehicle
when it was pulled over,

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:50.908
and neither do you.

01:12:50.991 --> 01:12:51.950
[sobbing]

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:54.244
[Stokes] You'll cause yourself
a lot less heartache

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:57.206
if you'll stop jumping to conclusions.

01:12:57.831 --> 01:13:01.418
At the moment... I don't know
why the car was stopped. Okay?

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:02.378
Okay.

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:04.922
And right now,
what I've told you is all I know.

01:13:05.005 --> 01:13:05.839
All right.

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:07.800
As soon as I know anything else,
I'll immediately--

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.134
Fine!

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:17.434
[Stokes] I will tell you this.

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:22.564
The car had a bumper sticker on it
that raises some concerns.

01:13:25.442 --> 01:13:27.111
I am aware of that.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:32.449
Kind of makes your close scrutiny
of your son's insurance

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:35.077
and registration card moot,
now doesn't it?

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.412
I don't see how.

01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:38.914
Come on, my sister,
I know you know better than that.

01:13:38.997 --> 01:13:40.332
I am not your sister.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.875
A black boy in that car

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:43.544
with a bumper sticker like that?

01:13:43.627 --> 01:13:44.753
He's asking for trouble.

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:46.505
And what does that tell you?

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:51.677
It tells me that the world is not the same
for people who look like you and me.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.262
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-Yes.

01:13:53.345 --> 01:13:54.763
That's what it tells me.

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:58.350
And it tells me that the people
who patrol the streets

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:01.770
with legal authority to use deadly force
are not robots.

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:04.231
They help their kids
brush their teeth at night

01:14:04.314 --> 01:14:05.899
and read them Dr. Seuss

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:08.610
and pray they get to do it again
the next night.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:12.406
And when they see some nihilistic,
agitating young thug,

01:14:12.489 --> 01:14:14.700
-pride may get the best of them.
-Who do you think you are

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:15.951
calling my son a thug?

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:18.745
Running cover for some cracker-ass cop.

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:20.914
The cop is black.

01:14:22.666 --> 01:14:24.251
The one who made the stop...

01:14:24.334 --> 01:14:25.961
he's black as you and me.

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.255
Let me tell you something, lady.

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:30.799
I parachuted out of planes.

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:33.594
I crawled through VC tunnels in Vietnam,

01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:36.930
but the most scared I have ever been
in my life, <i>ever,</i>

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.350
was when I made my first traffic stop
on a ghetto street.

01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:41.268
You know why?

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:45.397
Because there are hip-hop songs
and bumper stickers

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:47.441
and mobs shutting down the interstate

01:14:47.524 --> 01:14:49.485
saying that the cops are the enemy.

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.196
So it's okay to challenge them,
it's okay to question them.

01:14:52.279 --> 01:14:54.740
If they pull you over,
it's okay to bust out with an attitude

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:56.492
and act like gangsters
and have swagger.

01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:59.119
You step up to a cop,
that makes you hard, right?

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:01.330
Well, all that bullshit gets cops killed.

01:15:01.413 --> 01:15:04.374
I don't know who you're talking about,
but that is not my son.

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:07.961
My son was taught to be respectful
and assert his rights.

01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:12.633
When I pull you over, you got no grounds
to "assert your rights."

01:15:12.716 --> 01:15:14.760
You know what you got the right to do?

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:16.929
Shut up and do what I say.

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:20.557
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:23.894
You serve us. Not the other way around.

01:15:23.977 --> 01:15:27.272
What if your car matches one
in an Amber Alert?

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:31.401
What if you fit the BOLO of someone
who just shot up a school?

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:34.821
When you get pulled over,
you got no idea what it might be.

01:15:34.905 --> 01:15:37.407
Some hard-acting fool
just gets in the way.

01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:39.952
Maybe if you'd have grown up
in the Pork 'n' Beans like me,

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:43.080
you'd understand that black boys
don't act gangsta to be hard.

01:15:44.456 --> 01:15:46.416
They do it to hide their fear.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.126
I come up in Overtown, lady.

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:51.171
Ain't nobody got to tell me
why they do what they do.

01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:52.172
But hold up.

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:55.717
Y'all's family is living
the American Dream, ain't ya?

01:15:56.134 --> 01:15:58.554
Your son got no reason
to be afraid, right?

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:01.139
Is that what I'm supposed to be doing?

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.475
Teaching him to be scared?

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.561
Be a good boy, keep his mouth shut?

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:07.062
-Damn right.
-[Kendra chuckles]

01:16:07.145 --> 01:16:10.440
And make sure he understands,
that for us...

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:12.276
there ain't no American Dream.

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:18.448
Well, I guess I just wasn't raised
to be a bitter Uncle Tom like you.

01:16:18.532 --> 01:16:19.616
[scoffs]

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:20.867
Lady, you got a nerve.

01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:22.244
You damn right, I do.

01:16:22.327 --> 01:16:23.829
-[Stokes] I'll tell ya...
-Mm-hmm.

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:25.330
...two minutes with you,

01:16:25.872 --> 01:16:27.541
and I know your whole adult life.

01:16:27.624 --> 01:16:29.001
-Oh, bullshit.
-No, but I do.

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:31.545
I know you got a husband

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:34.673
carries around a picture of you
on his phone,

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:37.884
and every time he say
some fool-ass racist remark,

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:39.428
he pull out that picture and go,

01:16:39.511 --> 01:16:42.222
"Oh, no, not me.
'Cause looky here at my black wife."

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:47.853
I know you could never explain to him
that pain in your heart.

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:51.273
That pain that claws out your contentment

01:16:51.356 --> 01:16:54.735
because every public service announcement
for hepatitis C

01:16:54.818 --> 01:16:57.571
and every malt liquor billboard
got somebody on it

01:16:57.654 --> 01:16:59.364
look just like your baby boy.

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:04.995
Or why your son was the tallest
and the smartest kid in third grade,

01:17:05.078 --> 01:17:07.247
but the teacher never seemed
to call on him

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:10.042
no matter how high
he raised his little brown hand.

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:14.046
See, 'cause that's a pain
your man could never understand.

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:17.507
So you tried to kill that pain
by making your son proud

01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:19.718
and telling him to live
the American Dream

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:22.346
and teaching him to assert his rights,

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:25.557
instead of teaching him how to survive
as a black man in this country.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:26.808
Fuck you!

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.188
One thing I already know for sure
about this incident.

01:17:31.271 --> 01:17:33.523
Just like almost every other one of them,

01:17:34.024 --> 01:17:36.693
if the young brothers
would have just shut their mouths

01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:38.528
and done what they were told,

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:40.656
none of us would be here tonight,

01:17:41.406 --> 01:17:43.158
which is what I suggest you do.

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:44.868
Sit tight.

01:17:46.244 --> 01:17:47.120
And shut up.

01:17:49.873 --> 01:17:50.707
And, sister,

01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:53.710
next time you call a black man
an Uncle Tom,

01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:56.171
it'd play a whole lot better
if that black man

01:17:56.254 --> 01:17:59.257
hadn't just dragged your white husband
out the room in handcuffs.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:06.515
[door opens]

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.267
[door closes]

01:18:12.979 --> 01:18:14.981
[thunder crashing]

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.489
-[sobbing]
-[door opens]

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:27.285
They booked me.
Gave me a "promise to appear."

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:28.578
Stupid. Stupid...

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:30.706
I don't understand this.
I don't understand...

01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:32.791
Why did you walk up to me
at Carl and Joy's party?

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:34.376
What?

01:18:34.459 --> 01:18:37.379
The first time we ever met,
why did you walk up to me?

01:18:37.462 --> 01:18:38.839
Why did I... oh...

01:18:38.922 --> 01:18:40.924
-Kenny... What? Now?
-Tell me.

01:18:41.007 --> 01:18:43.176
-Tell me again. Please.
-Babe. I...

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.345
[groans, sighs]

01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:46.763
Hey.

01:18:49.766 --> 01:18:50.600
Because...

01:18:52.352 --> 01:18:53.270
[sniffles]

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.522
Because I was staring at you?

01:18:55.605 --> 01:18:57.482
No. I was staring at you.
I couldn't help myself.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:58.775
-What else?
-I, um...

01:18:58.859 --> 01:18:59.693
What else?

01:18:59.776 --> 01:19:02.529
You don't think Jamal got himself
into some kind of situation...

01:19:02.654 --> 01:19:05.949
We were standing on Carl and Joy's patio
and we were staring at each other...

01:19:06.032 --> 01:19:07.743
That's right.
We were staring at each other.

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:09.453
We couldn't take our eyes off each other.

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:10.912
-[Kendra] And?
-And I...

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.456
walked over.

01:19:12.539 --> 01:19:13.832
You walked over to me.

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:16.293
[Scott] And my heart was beating
so fast I could hardly talk.

01:19:16.376 --> 01:19:19.212
And there were all these girls
parading back and forth to the bar,

01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:20.756
but you never looked at one of them.

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:23.842
You just kept walking and staring at me.

01:19:24.551 --> 01:19:25.969
-[Scott] Yeah.
-[sobbing]

01:19:26.052 --> 01:19:27.971
-But then you looked up.
-[Scott] I looked up.

01:19:28.054 --> 01:19:29.097
Right past me.

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:33.477
And I thought... "Okay. Maybe not."

01:19:33.727 --> 01:19:35.228
-[Scott] <i>But I...</i>
-[Kendra] <i>But you...</i>

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:36.897
[Scott] <i>...put my hand on your shoulder.</i>

01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:38.815
[Kendra] <i>And you pointed out a bird...</i>

01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:41.443
<i>in a tree.</i>

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.408
<i>This gorgeous little red bird.</i>

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:49.785
[Scott] <i>And it flew away.</i>

01:19:49.868 --> 01:19:52.204
[Kendra]
<i>And you told me it was tired of being...</i>

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:55.415
[both] <i>The second most beautiful creature</i>
<i>at the party.</i>

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:59.211
-[Kendra] <i>That's what you said.</i>
-[Scott] <i>That's right.</i>

01:19:59.544 --> 01:20:00.378
[Kendra cries]

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:02.088
-[sighs]
-Hey.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:04.257
Hey, come here.

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:06.384
[sobbing quietly]

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.262
It's okay. It's okay.

01:20:10.555 --> 01:20:11.848
[crying]

01:20:12.849 --> 01:20:14.601
-It's coming apart.
-Mm-mmm.

01:20:14.684 --> 01:20:16.520
Yeah, everything's coming apart.

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:18.313
Kenny.

01:20:22.192 --> 01:20:23.777
I know you're not coming back.

01:20:28.907 --> 01:20:31.493
[sniffles] It-- it hurts, Scott.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.372
It hurts.

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:37.958
And the fact that she's white

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:40.710
makes it almost unbearable.

01:20:42.295 --> 01:20:43.630
[sobbing]

01:20:45.006 --> 01:20:46.258
I don't love her.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:48.593
Oh...

01:20:50.303 --> 01:20:52.055
[sniffles] Then why?

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:55.267
I just...

01:20:58.311 --> 01:21:00.105
[stammering] I don't...

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.942
[thunder rumbling]

01:21:05.485 --> 01:21:07.487
[bird chirping]

01:21:25.922 --> 01:21:28.216
-[crying] Kenny. Ken.
-[Kendra] No.

01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:31.428
[sobbing]

01:21:35.932 --> 01:21:38.560
We made a magnificent person,
didn't we?

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:39.936
We did.

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.190
I was thinking...

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:46.359
before you came back,

01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:48.528
about that time
when you and I were fighting--

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:50.405
I don't even remember what it was about--

01:21:50.488 --> 01:21:54.409
But Jamal was a baby, and I was upset.

01:21:55.201 --> 01:21:58.747
And he thought that I was crying
about the thunder and the lightning...

01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:01.833
-I remember.
-And he said...

01:22:02.542 --> 01:22:04.669
"Don't cry, Mama.

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:08.173
It's just God taking pictures
of the rain."

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:10.800
[laughing] Yeah. We...

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:13.428
We put it in his baby book. [laughs]

01:22:13.511 --> 01:22:16.222
[Kendra] And he... He grabbed my tears

01:22:16.848 --> 01:22:21.102
with his itty-bitty hands
and he tried to put them back in my eyes.

01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:25.440
[sobbing] Oh!

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.988
-[Scott mutters]
-Last night, I told him...

01:22:32.697 --> 01:22:33.740
[thunder rumbles]

01:22:33.823 --> 01:22:34.658
[Scott] <i>What?</i>

01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:37.118
[thunder rumbling]

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:38.036
What?

01:22:39.996 --> 01:22:42.332
-Ken. Kenny? Kenny.
-No.

01:22:42.415 --> 01:22:44.417
-[rain pattering]
-[thunder rumbling]

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:57.138
We were both furious,
and he was yelling at me, and-- and I...

01:22:57.597 --> 01:22:59.891
-You what?
-[Kendra] I said things to him.

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:00.976
Okay. What things?

01:23:01.059 --> 01:23:03.061
-Oh, God.
-Kendra. Hey, hey.

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.021
-Ken...
-Horrible...

01:23:05.605 --> 01:23:06.439
Hey.

01:23:06.523 --> 01:23:07.399
...ugly...

01:23:10.568 --> 01:23:13.238
things a mother
should never say to a child.

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:14.489
-Okay.
-Oh, God.

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:21.705
[voice trembling] I just wanna hold him.

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:28.586
I wanna look him in the eyes
and I just wanna--

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:31.464
I wanna take every word I said
out of his head

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:33.383
and bury it in the ground.

01:23:33.466 --> 01:23:35.593
-It's okay.
-God damn it! "Shoot cops."

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:39.389
-[thunder rumbling]
-[sighs]

01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:45.353
[gasps] I should-- I should have
gone out there with a razor

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:47.939
and peeled that goddamn thing
off his car.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:48.857
No.

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.859
I should've gone out there
as soon as I saw it.

01:23:50.942 --> 01:23:52.527
Shouldn't matter,
shouldn't make a difference.

01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.654
It's not your fault. It's not his fault.

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:57.866
I'll never say a cross word to him again.
I just need to know he's okay.

01:23:57.949 --> 01:23:59.159
He is. He's okay.

01:23:59.242 --> 01:24:01.036
-Please, Jesus, let him be okay.
-He's okay.

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:02.454
He's okay.

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:06.916
-[door clicks]
-He's okay.

01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:23.475
Your son, Jamal Connor,
was a rear seat passenger

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:26.686
in a vehicle with a Jarvis Bell

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:28.396
and a DeShawn Rolle.

01:24:29.147 --> 01:24:32.400
Bell was wanted on a misdemeanor warrant
for marijuana possession.

01:24:33.651 --> 01:24:36.154
The car was tailed by a Metro cruiser

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:38.865
near the Scott Projects in Liberty City,

01:24:38.948 --> 01:24:42.744
where the driver was observed
purchasing a nickel bag of marijuana.

01:24:42.827 --> 01:24:43.703
God damn it.

01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:48.124
Following the purchase,
while driving westbound on 79th Street,

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.794
the car was approached
by a marked patrol car.

01:24:50.877 --> 01:24:54.672
Officer Rodney Banks,
who had witnessed the purchase,

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:55.924
<i>pulled the car over.</i>

01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:58.968
The camera on the patrol car

01:24:59.052 --> 01:25:02.639
shows Officer Banks approaching
the driver's side of the vehicle.

01:25:03.306 --> 01:25:05.517
Mr. Bell was driving the car.

01:25:06.684 --> 01:25:10.563
The officer returns to his vehicle
with the occupants' identification

01:25:10.647 --> 01:25:14.067
and apparently begins checking them
on his laptop.

01:25:14.692 --> 01:25:20.115
After approximately 30 seconds,
Mr. Bell exits the vehicle

01:25:20.198 --> 01:25:21.950
and attempts to approach the officer.

01:25:22.408 --> 01:25:25.829
The officer pulls his gun
and gets Mr. Bell to the ground.

01:25:25.912 --> 01:25:26.746
Oh, God.

01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:28.790
[Stokes] As the officer calls for backup,

01:25:28.873 --> 01:25:31.960
DeShawn Rolle exits
from the rear of the vehicle.

01:25:32.043 --> 01:25:34.462
The officer trains his gun on Rolle.

01:25:35.171 --> 01:25:38.258
At that moment,
Jamal Connor exits the vehicle

01:25:38.341 --> 01:25:40.969
in an apparent effort
to place his hands on the hood of the car.

01:25:41.052 --> 01:25:43.304
-No.
-[Stokes] It's wet, he may have slipped,

01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:48.143
as Jarvis Bell simultaneously
begins to stand up and take flight.

01:25:48.518 --> 01:25:51.938
The officer, now confronted
with all three vehicle occupants,

01:25:52.021 --> 01:25:53.356
one of whom has a warrant,

01:25:53.439 --> 01:25:55.692
and not having searched the vehicle
for a possible weapon...

01:25:55.775 --> 01:25:56.651
Oh, no.

01:25:57.235 --> 01:25:59.863
...fires three shots
at the fleeing suspect.

01:26:00.864 --> 01:26:03.449
Either a stray shot or a ricochet,
we don't know which yet,

01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:05.869
strikes Jamal Connor in the head...

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:08.830
killing him instantly.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.042
I am...

01:26:13.585 --> 01:26:15.295
terribly sorry for your loss.

01:26:15.378 --> 01:26:16.254
No...

01:26:16.588 --> 01:26:18.047
[screaming] No!

01:26:18.756 --> 01:26:21.092
There will be a full inquiry.

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:22.886
[sobbing] No, no.

01:26:22.969 --> 01:26:24.262
I'll give you a moment.

01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:27.891
No...

01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:33.938
[wailing]

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:36.691
