WEBVTT

00:02.575 --> 00:04.546
Max, Caroline, I have announcement.

00:04.712 --> 00:07.341
You're actually much shorter
and are walking on stilts?

00:07.507 --> 00:09.823
I have made a special menu

00:09.948 --> 00:11.928
for tomorrow's
Valentine's night dinner.

00:12.094 --> 00:14.139
Han, that's so romantic.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.013
Yeah, romantic and wrong.

00:16.138 --> 00:17.598
This place isn't
<i>When Harry met Sally.</i>

00:17.723 --> 00:20.501
It's "When Harry met Salmonella."

00:21.627 --> 00:23.003
Max, Club Sandwich.

00:23.128 --> 00:25.359
And heads up... I lost a band-aid.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.696
Theme menu means
I can charge one bigger price,

00:29.862 --> 00:30.697
like in top restaurants.

00:30.863 --> 00:33.075
See?
"Prick fix."

00:33.241 --> 00:34.785
Oh, Han, it's pronounced "prix fixe."

00:34.951 --> 00:36.183
Have you seen our chef?

00:36.308 --> 00:38.747
It's definitely "prick fix."

00:38.913 --> 00:40.121
Tomorrow night,

00:40.246 --> 00:43.043
Cupid will come
to Williamsburg diner.

00:46.629 --> 00:49.049
Didn't have the heart
to tell him Cupid is dead.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.582
Yep, hit by a mack truck

00:51.707 --> 00:54.168
crossing
the Brooklyn-Queens expressway...

00:54.293 --> 00:56.220
His fat, diapered baby ass

00:56.345 --> 00:58.595
splattered all over the windshield.

00:59.380 --> 01:01.976
I love Valentine's Day.

01:02.101 --> 01:04.022
That's your reaction?
I killed Cupid.

01:04.188 --> 01:05.774
You're either romantic or not.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.631
I'm not even going to try
to convince you.

01:07.756 --> 01:09.444
Oh, he's dead.
And the proof...

01:09.610 --> 01:11.885
When's the last time you knew
anyone who fell in love?

01:12.010 --> 01:14.366
Real love, like <i>Ice Loves Coco.</i>

01:14.532 --> 01:15.951
How about them?

01:16.117 --> 01:18.161
They've been holding hands and
romantic whispering all night.

01:18.327 --> 01:20.945
Their romantic whispering
goes like this.

01:21.070 --> 01:22.670
"I own nipple clamps."

01:25.240 --> 01:27.368
Plink!
Cupid's not dead.

01:27.493 --> 01:29.172
Plink!
There goes his little arrow.

01:29.338 --> 01:30.738
Plink, plink!

01:30.863 --> 01:33.424
Clamp, ouch!
Clamp, ouch!

01:33.549 --> 01:35.595
Clamp, clamp!
Ouch, ouch!

01:37.346 --> 01:47.123

01:53.587 --> 01:56.283
{pub}Max, since it's just after midnight,

01:56.449 --> 01:58.612
it's now officially Valentine's Day.

01:58.737 --> 02:00.704
I've got something in here
for you... guess what it is.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.450
Well, judging from
that smile on your face,

02:03.575 --> 02:05.917
I'd say it's a finger-sized hole
in your apron.

02:08.746 --> 02:11.208
Candy hearts!
Here, hold out your hand.

02:11.333 --> 02:12.966
Let's get our heart on.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.844
I'm way ahead of you.

02:19.623 --> 02:21.808
"Be mine"... classic.
What's yours say?

02:21.974 --> 02:24.704
"Caroline Channing is lame.

02:24.829 --> 02:27.340
"I hate you for giving me this.

02:27.465 --> 02:29.810
Valentine's Day is the worst."

02:29.935 --> 02:31.435
Ooh, cinnamon.
Mmm.

02:37.114 --> 02:38.533
Good evening, Earl.

02:38.699 --> 02:40.520
My, my, my, Sophie,

02:40.645 --> 02:43.106
seeing you in that dress
makes my heart race.

02:43.231 --> 02:46.374
Two scoops of ice cream
in a one scoop cone.

02:46.540 --> 02:50.163
Oh, Earl, you make me smile.

02:50.288 --> 02:54.466
I wish we had black people in
Poland when I was growing up.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.569
Too bad.

02:56.694 --> 03:01.097
We really would have enjoyed
segregation and Hitler.

03:01.263 --> 03:04.221
Oh, hi, building neighbors.

03:04.678 --> 03:07.938
Well, I was just driving by,
and since it was raining,

03:08.104 --> 03:09.749
I thought I could offer you two girls

03:09.874 --> 03:11.733
a ride home in my town car.

03:11.899 --> 03:13.804
The last time
someone offered me a ride,

03:13.929 --> 03:17.057
I ended up in
a drainage pipe in Jersey.

03:17.182 --> 03:18.698
Sophia, you rent a town car?

03:18.864 --> 03:21.311
Yes, but only when it's raining,

03:21.436 --> 03:24.981
because, you know, I got hair
extensions and nail extensions,

03:25.106 --> 03:28.667
and, you know, I...
I'm too extended to walk.

03:31.727 --> 03:34.898
Hello.
I saw you from kitchen.

03:35.023 --> 03:38.218
You turned pick-up window
into painting.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.928
Plink!

03:40.094 --> 03:42.768
Velvet painting of nude at counter.

03:43.806 --> 03:46.434
Clamp, ouch!

03:49.299 --> 03:51.565
The girls tell me
you own cleaning service.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.984
I would like to hire you
to clean my house.

03:54.150 --> 03:56.313
Oh, yeah, this is possible.

03:56.438 --> 03:58.780
I will send girl.
What is your address?

03:58.946 --> 04:00.433
I don't want some girl.

04:00.558 --> 04:02.308
I want you to come clean.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.274
Oh, you cannot get me to come.

04:12.436 --> 04:14.236
Oh, I can get you to come.

04:16.796 --> 04:20.677
No, I can no longer come anymore.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.639
No, Max and Caroline can come.

04:24.805 --> 04:26.905
No, no, we're not coming.

04:29.439 --> 04:32.856
So no one can get you to come?

04:33.022 --> 04:36.843
Well, some people
can get me to come...

04:38.012 --> 04:40.113
Just not you.

04:41.185 --> 04:43.894
Hard to get... I like it.

04:44.019 --> 04:46.081
Go get the coats.
I'll get this check.

04:47.439 --> 04:48.994
Here's the last check, Earl.

04:49.119 --> 04:51.124
Oh, Max, can you take care
of that for me, please?

04:51.290 --> 04:52.250
Sure. Why?

04:52.416 --> 04:54.571
Uh, nothing pressing...
Just having a heart attack.

04:54.696 --> 04:55.462
I'll see you tomorrow.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.589
Wait, you're having a heart attack?

04:57.755 --> 04:59.209
Most definitely.

04:59.334 --> 05:00.800
I've had three in my life.
We're old friends.

05:00.966 --> 05:02.677
Earl, you're having a heart attack.

05:02.843 --> 05:04.798
I'll be fine.
Have you seen my tangerine?

05:04.923 --> 05:07.307
I had a tangerine set aside
for my walk home.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.850
Forget the tangerine.

05:09.016 --> 05:10.393
Earl's having a heart attack!

05:10.559 --> 05:13.146
Sophie, we're taking
the town car to the hospital.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.814
Earl, when did the pain start?

05:14.980 --> 05:18.634
When I saw Sophie in that dress.

05:22.773 --> 05:24.184
Oh, hell, no!

05:24.309 --> 05:26.826
Why is this line so long?
Did the new iPhone come out?

05:26.992 --> 05:28.388
Let's just get him over there.

05:28.513 --> 05:30.580
Max, anything you can do
to move this along?

05:30.746 --> 05:33.393
Move!
Celebrity coming through.

05:33.518 --> 05:36.169
Morgan Freeman having a heart attack.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.630
He is having a heart attack.

05:38.796 --> 05:41.174
On a scale of one to ten,
what's your pain?

05:41.340 --> 05:43.203
Uh, two, we were
just in the neighborhood,

05:43.328 --> 05:45.470
looking for a place to have jell-o.

05:45.636 --> 05:48.306
I was talking to Morgan Freeman.

05:48.472 --> 05:50.126
Take him now!

05:50.251 --> 05:52.018
Sir, he has a history
of heart trouble.

05:52.184 --> 05:53.645
All right, we'll get him in.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.563
Earl, go with the nurse.

05:56.247 --> 05:58.289
Damn, it's a man.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.903
We'll be right out here, Earl.
Everything is gonna be okay.

06:02.069 --> 06:03.571
Have a seat and wait.

06:03.737 --> 06:07.027
Look at me, Gingerbread.
If anything happens to him,

06:07.152 --> 06:09.327
I will staple your nut sack
to that chair.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:27.033 --> 06:28.471
{pub}That's right... it's me again.

06:28.637 --> 06:30.913
For the tenth time, he's fine.

06:31.038 --> 06:33.699
He had a minor attack,
but he's in good hands.

06:33.824 --> 06:36.702
I would know... I had both
of my heart attacks here.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.898
I want to go back there
and see for myself.

06:39.064 --> 06:40.442
Family members only.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.152
Well, I'm his daughter.

06:42.318 --> 06:46.281
Oh, really? It says here
he's 75 years old...

06:46.447 --> 06:48.074
Well, he started late.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.410
And African-American.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.872
He started late with a honky.
I'm one of those combo babies.

06:54.038 --> 06:55.623
Here...

06:55.789 --> 06:57.356
You need proof?

06:57.481 --> 07:01.493
My last name is Black, see?
Max Black.

07:01.618 --> 07:02.745
He's black.
I'm Black.

07:02.870 --> 07:04.632
It'd be dumb if we weren't related.

07:04.798 --> 07:07.927
Can I just get back
to playing <i>Angry Birds?</i>

07:08.093 --> 07:10.002
You are yammering on here
about nothing

07:10.127 --> 07:12.557
while the love of my life
is back there alone and scared.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.089
You said he was your father.

07:14.214 --> 07:16.102
Now he's the love of your life?

07:16.268 --> 07:19.606
He's both.
We're from the South.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.107
Have a seat.

07:23.673 --> 07:26.237
I got us two lattes.
It took forever.

07:26.403 --> 07:28.637
The guy in front of me
missed his kidney transplant

07:28.762 --> 07:30.589
waiting for a mocha frappuccino.

07:30.714 --> 07:31.910
- Any news?
- The same.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.913
But they won't let me back there.
I even told him Earl was my father.

07:36.121 --> 07:38.614
Now's my chance.
Nurse Chewbacca's on the move.

07:38.739 --> 07:39.793
I'm going back there.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.533
If you see anyone about
to notice me sneak by,

07:41.658 --> 07:42.879
draw all the attention to yourself.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.090
Max, I don't know if I can do that.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.742
You're right.
That's kind of my thing.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.985
- Okay, let me think.
- You don't have time to think.

07:49.110 --> 07:50.386
Just throw the coffees
against the wall.

07:50.552 --> 07:51.627
That's ridiculous.

07:51.752 --> 07:53.245
I graduated top of my class
at Wharton.

07:53.370 --> 07:54.307
I can do better than that.

07:54.838 --> 07:59.020
<i>Paging Dr. Bender.
Paging Dr. Bender, please.</i>

07:59.186 --> 08:01.272
Oh, my God!

08:05.192 --> 08:07.737
Those were not nonfat.

08:14.941 --> 08:15.829
Earl!

08:15.995 --> 08:18.665
- You in here?
- Max, is that you?

08:19.839 --> 08:22.191
Ain't you sweet?

08:22.316 --> 08:24.102
But you didn't have
to wait around for me.

08:24.227 --> 08:26.111
This is Narcissus.

08:26.236 --> 08:27.715
She's from the Fiji Islands

08:27.881 --> 08:30.844
and gives one hell of a sponge bath.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.568
Hi.
Can we have a minute alone?

08:34.628 --> 08:36.038
Earl, do you think
this is a good time

08:36.163 --> 08:38.183
to have a sponge bath...
I mean, in your condition?

08:38.350 --> 08:40.042
Max, when they look like that,

08:40.167 --> 08:42.856
there's never a bad time
for a sponge bath.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.859
- So are you doing okay now?
- Pretty good.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.800
The doctor said it was a mild one,

08:47.925 --> 08:50.185
but I'm going to have
to stay here a couple nights.

08:50.310 --> 08:53.032
Could you find out how much
extra for me to get my own room?

08:53.198 --> 08:54.576
A private room?

08:54.742 --> 08:56.275
The last time I was
in one of these places,

08:56.400 --> 08:58.844
the guy in the bed next to me
thought he was a parrot

08:58.969 --> 09:02.417
and asked me for crackers
the whole damn night.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.182
Done. I'll get you your own room.

09:04.307 --> 09:05.818
And don't worry about the expenses.

09:05.943 --> 09:08.020
I got a little money
stashed away for a rainy day.

09:08.145 --> 09:09.955
I am not using your money.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.260
But let me guess,
"rainy day" is a strain of weed?

09:12.426 --> 09:13.761
Now you're getting it.

09:17.537 --> 09:18.725
I'll see you later.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.768
Don't die, or I'll kill you.

09:23.270 --> 09:25.070
So what, now you want a private room?

09:25.195 --> 09:26.733
How's he going to pay for that?

09:26.899 --> 09:29.641
Oh, so that old man has
to be the only man in America

09:29.766 --> 09:31.446
who has to pay his medical bills?

09:31.612 --> 09:35.491
Mr. Freeman's done
a lot of successful movies.

09:35.657 --> 09:38.536
I don't think your sarcastic
attitude is very professional.

09:38.702 --> 09:40.019
"Professional"?

09:40.144 --> 09:43.055
Um, an hour ago,
your little thug friend here

09:43.180 --> 09:46.586
threatened to cut me so deep,
I'd have a vagina.

09:49.452 --> 09:51.257
That offer still stands.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.678
She's upset.
And vagina's her go-to.

09:55.844 --> 09:58.003
Well, the only reason
I haven't called security

09:58.128 --> 10:00.225
is they were laid off two weeks ago.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.601
What is your name?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.075
Tig.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.396
And it's fake,
so good luck with that.

10:05.562 --> 10:06.912
Sir, you're representing

10:07.037 --> 10:09.108
the Shecter family wing
of this hospital.

10:09.274 --> 10:11.133
My family knows the Schecters.

10:11.258 --> 10:13.185
In fact, their son David
interns here,

10:13.310 --> 10:15.687
and if I made a call,
he would not be pleased.

10:15.812 --> 10:16.922
If you know them,

10:17.047 --> 10:19.892
why are we talking
to this lump behind a desk?

10:20.017 --> 10:22.361
Suck it, red face!
We're going over your head!

10:22.486 --> 10:23.957
How do you like me now, bitch?

10:26.056 --> 10:27.502
Hey, get your phone.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.485
See if he can swing Earl
a private room.

10:29.610 --> 10:30.838
I think I still have his cell number.

10:31.004 --> 10:33.205
We went out a few times
until I realized he was serious

10:33.330 --> 10:35.009
about going down that pro Bono route.

10:35.175 --> 10:37.042
- Did you two have sex?
- No.

10:37.167 --> 10:39.819
Sweet, that's what you
can offer him for the room.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.633
That's amazing.

10:44.758 --> 10:47.355
Someone found a florist
that delivers after midnight.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.587
That's not so amazing.

10:48.712 --> 10:50.422
I know a guy
named "Sticky Icky" Ricky

10:50.547 --> 10:53.486
who delivers
exclusively after midnight.

10:53.652 --> 10:56.478
You know, I just realized
this is the first Valentine's Day

10:56.603 --> 10:58.116
I won't get flowers from my father.

10:58.282 --> 11:01.995
Aw, that's cute,
with a big old side of creepy.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.569
No, it's sweet.

11:03.694 --> 11:05.354
Every year
from the time I was a baby,

11:05.479 --> 11:07.072
and even when I had boyfriends,

11:07.197 --> 11:09.691
I'd get flowers from my father
with a card that says,

11:09.816 --> 11:11.462
"You'll always be my Valentine."

11:11.628 --> 11:14.530
I got a sweet Valentine from
a guy I liked in high school.

11:14.655 --> 11:17.969
It said, "I'll give you
five bucks to lift your shirt."

11:20.345 --> 11:22.515
Caroline...
Hey, I'll be right with you.

11:22.681 --> 11:25.143
There he is.
Cuter than I remember.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.961
Hey. Wow.

11:29.086 --> 11:31.107
When I heard your voice mail,
I couldn't believe it.

11:31.273 --> 11:33.265
Yes, well, I wasn't sure
you'd want to come down,

11:33.390 --> 11:35.278
because...
you know...

11:35.444 --> 11:37.280
You dumped me two years ago?

11:37.446 --> 11:39.615
Well, "dumped" is a strong word.

11:39.781 --> 11:42.434
Tore my heart out,
shook it in front of my face.

11:42.915 --> 11:44.120
That any softer?

11:45.969 --> 11:48.230
Hate to interrupt
the "perfect white teeth" convention,

11:48.355 --> 11:49.514
but we're in a hurry.

11:49.639 --> 11:50.918
David, this is my friend Max.

11:51.084 --> 11:52.350
A friend of ours was admitted,

11:52.475 --> 11:54.339
and we were hoping
to get him a private room.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.954
Oh, so you're not here to return

11:56.079 --> 11:57.592
my Dartmouth t-shirt
you stole from me.

11:57.758 --> 11:58.957
You gave that to me.

11:59.082 --> 12:00.595
No, I didn't!
I love that shirt.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.462
I feel like I lost custody
of it in a divorce,

12:03.587 --> 12:05.558
and now I'm like a deadbeat dad.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.216
How about the room?
Any chance?

12:07.341 --> 12:08.519
Please.
Pretty please.

12:08.685 --> 12:10.169
Oh, well, since
you said "pretty please,"

12:10.294 --> 12:11.272
I'll see what I can do.

12:11.438 --> 12:14.056
We should be clear.
We can't pay.

12:14.181 --> 12:16.225
We're broke...
both of us.

12:16.350 --> 12:17.904
But I'm sure
you heard that somewhere.

12:18.070 --> 12:18.927
Yeah...

12:19.052 --> 12:19.989
Everywhere.

12:21.355 --> 12:23.348
David, I hope your family
didn't lose any money

12:23.473 --> 12:24.410
with my father.
Did they?

12:24.576 --> 12:26.287
Nope, still filthy rich.

12:27.003 --> 12:29.938
And I can do my best to burn
some filthy off that rich,

12:30.063 --> 12:31.292
by getting your friend a V.I.P. room.

12:32.063 --> 12:33.544
I'll just drop some names.

12:33.710 --> 12:35.527
By that, I mean my own.

12:35.652 --> 12:36.798
Shouldn't be a problem.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.106
I love Jews.

12:40.995 --> 12:42.986
Yeah, we're generous.
Spread the word.

12:48.581 --> 12:52.688
Uh, if you wouldn't mind
giving Narcissus my whereabouts?

12:52.854 --> 12:55.714
Did you see the look on
that desk lump's big, red face

12:55.839 --> 12:56.943
when I pushed you by him?

12:57.109 --> 12:59.084
I did, but I think
throwing him the finger

12:59.209 --> 13:01.823
was a tad out of line.

13:02.793 --> 13:06.058
Wow, Dr. David really hooked us up.

13:06.183 --> 13:10.095
Yeah, this is like an episode
<i>I.C.U. Edition.</i>

13:10.220 --> 13:11.763
So, Earl, what do you think?

13:11.888 --> 13:13.334
Good lord, is that a Matisse?

13:13.500 --> 13:16.129
- I believe so.
- Then, mama, I'm home.

13:24.776 --> 13:26.639
{pub}Here, ladies, put
these suckers in your station.

13:26.805 --> 13:29.142
I think I might get
a late Valentine dinner crowd.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.628
You also think you might
get a late growth spurt,

13:31.753 --> 13:34.230
but that's not happening either.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.983
At best,
you'll get three single girls

13:36.108 --> 13:39.527
waddling over at midnight
to cry into some tapioca.

13:39.693 --> 13:42.156
True.
I need to cut the crap.

13:42.281 --> 13:43.774
Valentine's dinner is bust.

13:43.899 --> 13:48.411
And look, I have sacrificed
my manhood for no cash value.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.872
But your wings are adorable.

13:51.038 --> 13:55.334
Yes, but matching panties
are suffocating the boys.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.004
Come on, close early.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.047
We've only got
one table of twi-hards.

14:00.213 --> 14:01.382
I want to go see Earl.

14:01.548 --> 14:04.044
Oh, what the hell?
I love my man Earl, too.

14:04.169 --> 14:06.053
So screw it.
Let's fly over there.

14:09.890 --> 14:13.470
Ooh, this isn't like
the hospitals in Poland.

14:13.595 --> 14:15.939
The lights are working.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.566
Okay, sit down.
I'll take you in one at a time.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.018
All right, Cupid, you're first.

14:23.521 --> 14:25.573
Oh, don't wake him.
Go back out.

14:25.739 --> 14:29.535
Angels.
Oh, lord, no.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.990
Thank God it's you, Han.

14:33.115 --> 14:35.292
I saw the wings,
and I thought heaven was filled

14:35.417 --> 14:39.962
with chunky Chinese cherubs
and no jazz.

14:40.128 --> 14:43.382
Oh, okay, great.
I'll see you in five.

14:43.548 --> 14:45.085
I'm gonna go meet Dr. David.

14:45.210 --> 14:46.470
Oh, wait a second.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.555
If you're going to go meet man,
you need lip gloss.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.014
Oh, thanks, Sophie.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.391
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Okay.

14:57.388 --> 15:00.733
I have Valentine gift
I want to give you.

15:00.899 --> 15:03.444
Oh, hepatitis "C"?

15:04.350 --> 15:06.455
Happy Valentine's Day.

15:08.682 --> 15:12.046
Look at me.
Now look at you.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.431
Now look at me again.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.458
Does this look right to you?

15:19.027 --> 15:21.540
Hard to get... I like it.

15:24.626 --> 15:27.635
Oh, hey.
So how's your friend doing?

15:27.801 --> 15:29.096
Good.
And thanks for that V.I.P. room.

15:29.221 --> 15:31.798
He feels like a million bucks,
which I'm sure is what it costs,

15:31.923 --> 15:33.683
so I brought you
a little thank-you gift.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.353
That is not my Dartmouth shirt.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.145
No, that's held hostage
at the townhouse.

15:38.311 --> 15:40.273
This says Williamsburg.
That's where I live now.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.359
No way.
That's where I live.

15:42.484 --> 15:43.977
Yeah, I moved there
just to piss my father off,

15:44.102 --> 15:45.444
but I wound up loving it.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.447
I wound up loving it, too.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.816
Hey, maybe we could see
each other there sometime...

15:49.941 --> 15:51.200
You know, go out?

15:51.366 --> 15:53.035
Yeah, I don't think so.

15:53.201 --> 15:54.947
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what?

15:57.164 --> 15:59.242
Look, Caroline,
it's been really great

15:59.367 --> 16:01.052
getting to reconnect with you, but...

16:01.177 --> 16:03.129
I don't see this happening again.

16:03.911 --> 16:04.755
Oh.

16:04.921 --> 16:06.500
I mean, it's my parents.

16:06.625 --> 16:08.903
With your father in prison,
the whole scandal,

16:09.283 --> 16:10.886
I could never bring you home.

16:11.713 --> 16:13.848
Not even just
to piss off your father?

16:14.014 --> 16:16.784
I mean, me dating Caroline Channing...
What would people think?

16:16.909 --> 16:19.624
I hope you understand.
Oh, hey, thanks for the tee.

16:22.397 --> 16:24.434
Nice of everyone to stop by.

16:24.559 --> 16:27.028
Didn't see Caroline.
She busy tonight?

16:27.194 --> 16:28.655
Oh, no, she's here.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.408
She's out there running around,
trying to swing a boyfriend situation

16:31.533 --> 16:33.909
with her doctor friend
who got us the V.I.P. hook-up.

16:34.422 --> 16:35.912
What about you, Max?

16:36.037 --> 16:38.771
No sweetheart on Valentine's Day.

16:39.414 --> 16:40.817
I worry about you.

16:40.942 --> 16:43.044
Be nice if you had someone special.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.087
I already do.

16:45.253 --> 16:49.593
Ah, Max, I'm only going to be
around another 30 or 40 years.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.302
You better widen the net a bit.

16:52.427 --> 16:54.805
Visiting hours are up.
Friends have to leave.

16:54.971 --> 16:56.432
She can stay, nurse.
She's family.

16:57.432 --> 16:59.644
Earl, I'm family?

16:59.810 --> 17:02.730
Yes, and the best kind of family.
You don't want my money.

17:04.932 --> 17:07.609
Hey, Earl.
You look really good.

17:07.776 --> 17:11.848
So did you and Dr. Dave
do it in a hospital closet?

17:11.973 --> 17:13.366
All very "Grey's Monotony"?

17:13.531 --> 17:15.018
No, that won't be happening.

17:15.143 --> 17:17.020
I asked him out and
he said he could never date me,

17:17.145 --> 17:20.414
because of my father
and "what would people think?"

17:20.579 --> 17:22.358
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what?

17:22.483 --> 17:23.794
I feel like I was just hit

17:23.919 --> 17:25.836
by the same mack truck
that killed Cupid.

17:26.002 --> 17:28.415
Well, somebody's about
to get hit by a truck...

17:28.540 --> 17:30.466
A Max truck.

17:33.718 --> 17:36.706
Hey, you, Dr. I-Forget-Your-Name.

17:36.831 --> 17:39.058
How?
It's written on every wall.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.532
Okay, Dr. Exit.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.600
What is wrong with you?
Doctors are supposed to be sensitive.

17:46.725 --> 17:49.102
I mean, it's Valentine's Day,
and she has nothing.

17:49.227 --> 17:50.987
Couldn't you be like
every other guy on the planet

17:51.112 --> 17:53.989
and just lead her on
and not call her the next day?

17:54.155 --> 17:55.908
That is the decent thing to do.

17:56.074 --> 17:59.496
And for the record, she is
so hopped up on candy hearts,

17:59.621 --> 18:02.238
you would have gotten some
tonight, fo' sho!

18:03.458 --> 18:06.001
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

18:06.861 --> 18:09.005
Well, I guess nobody knows me
better than you,

18:09.130 --> 18:10.589
girl I've never met before.

18:11.833 --> 18:14.577
And now I would like to speak
to the pro Bono part of you,

18:14.702 --> 18:16.096
who understands
that nothing I just said

18:16.221 --> 18:18.048
should affect that man
in the V.I.P. room.

18:18.173 --> 18:19.932
That was actually
a very cool thing to do.

18:20.098 --> 18:21.584
Earl is fine.
Don't worry.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.898
And as far as Caroline goes,
I'm sorry, but...

18:24.023 --> 18:26.143
Her father hurt a lot of people.

18:26.511 --> 18:28.399
Whatever you put out there
comes back to you.

18:33.357 --> 18:34.358
Ugh.

18:36.573 --> 18:40.578
What now... you gonna threaten
to feed me my nipples again?

18:41.895 --> 18:42.907
No.

18:43.415 --> 18:44.991
Actually, someone just said something

18:45.116 --> 18:46.960
about the things
you do coming back to you,

18:47.085 --> 18:49.920
and I decided the smart move
was to apologize.

18:50.086 --> 18:52.814
Thanks, but it's not necessary.

18:53.258 --> 18:56.719
Actually, you're the nicest
person I've dealt with tonight.

18:56.885 --> 19:00.307
Ugh.
Rough job, dude.

19:00.432 --> 19:03.726
Here, Happy Valentine's Day.

19:04.830 --> 19:06.353
You want to go out sometime?

19:06.519 --> 19:09.399
Why would...

19:09.524 --> 19:12.109
Yeah, give me your number.
I'll call you tomorrow.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.777
Sleeping in
that hospital chair all night

19:20.902 --> 19:22.245
wasn't that uncomfortable.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.446
No, the chairs weren't.

19:23.571 --> 19:27.117
Your sad Valentine whimpering was.

19:27.242 --> 19:29.835
- So how you feeling this morning?
- Pretty good,

19:30.001 --> 19:32.372
considering I survived
the very first Valentine's Day

19:32.497 --> 19:34.131
I didn't get flowers from my father.

19:34.297 --> 19:36.126
Ugh.

19:36.251 --> 19:38.044
So you got one year under your belt.

19:38.169 --> 19:39.303
Don't get so cocky.

19:39.469 --> 19:42.264
You still have
to make 23 more to tie me.

19:42.430 --> 19:46.102
You know, all this time,
I've been feeling sorry for you

19:46.227 --> 19:47.554
'cause you didn't know your father,

19:47.679 --> 19:50.806
but after seeing
how you took care of Earl...

19:51.732 --> 19:54.027
I feel sorry for your father
that he didn't know you.

19:54.317 --> 19:56.403
You would have been
a wonderful daughter.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.740
Don't hold that thought.

19:59.906 --> 20:04.077
I don't want to cry till after
we break open the tapioca.

20:08.482 --> 20:12.546
No, I didn't just win
a beauty contest.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.198
No, these were left
on the front doorstep.

20:15.323 --> 20:16.833
They're both addressed to Caroline.

20:16.958 --> 20:19.035
- Sorry, Max.
- Oh, no, that's cool.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.679
Wouldn't want to break
my winning streak.

20:21.845 --> 20:24.374
Oh, well, just look at it this way.

20:24.499 --> 20:27.560
She got the flowers.
You got the knockers.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.105
All right, girls,

20:31.271 --> 20:32.816
well, I'm off to buy scratchers

20:32.941 --> 20:36.235
before all
the Puerto Ricans get them.

20:39.013 --> 20:40.807
"You'll always be my Valentine.

20:40.932 --> 20:42.859
Love, Daddy."

20:42.984 --> 20:43.893
Aw.

20:44.018 --> 20:45.612
The other one from Dr. Dave?

20:45.737 --> 20:48.163
Change his mind
after I tore him a new one?

20:48.329 --> 20:50.958
It's from my father as well,
but it's written to you.

20:53.210 --> 20:56.172
"Thank you for taking such
good care of my sweetheart.

20:56.297 --> 20:57.375
M. Channing."

20:58.214 --> 20:59.633
That is so sweet.
