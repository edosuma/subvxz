WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:03.698
Previously on Elementary...
Shinwell, you were shot at.

00:03.730 --> 00:06.164
Leave it alone. _
We can't Just do nothing.

00:06.200 --> 00:06.859
I'll be fine.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.731
Ballistics came back
on a slug,

00:08.770 --> 00:11.136
and it was a match
for bullets collected

00:11.170 --> 00:13.604
from an unsolved murder case
12 years ago.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.301
Victim's name is
Jameel Clark.

00:15.340 --> 00:17.479
You shot at Shinwell,
because 12 years ago

00:17.510 --> 00:19.046
he murdered your brother.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.718
Tell me I'm wrong.

00:29.460 --> 00:30.427
HOLMES:
Sorry.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.496
Why are you sorry?

00:32.530 --> 00:33.827
Well, you care about
Shinwell.

00:33.860 --> 00:37.364
You've been nothing
but kind to him.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.095
Learning he's not the man
that you thought he was,

00:39.140 --> 00:40.767
it must be disappointing.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.768
And you believe everything
that Damon Clark told you?

00:42.810 --> 00:44.334
There's no possibility
he was lying?

00:44.370 --> 00:45.564
I saw no indication.

00:45.610 --> 00:47.373
And keep in mind,
he didn't come to me.

00:47.410 --> 00:48.502
I went to him.

00:48.540 --> 00:50.349
I was looking for
confirmation of a theory

00:50.380 --> 00:52.519
based on my interpretation
of his brother's case,

00:52.550 --> 00:54.370
and the recent attempt
on Shinwell's life.

00:54.420 --> 00:57.184
12 years ago,
Shinwell murdered Jameel Clark.

00:57.220 --> 00:58.744
It's the only thing
that makes any sense.

00:58.790 --> 01:02.282
Maybe. Or maybe
there was another reason

01:02.330 --> 01:03.729
that Damon wanted
to hurt Shinwell.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.853
Watson...
You said it yourself,

01:05.890 --> 01:07.221
you went to Damon--
maybe Damon told you

01:07.260 --> 01:08.625
what you wanted to hear.

01:08.660 --> 01:10.867
He told a completely
different story 12 years ago.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.834
He said he didn't see
or hear anything

01:12.870 --> 01:14.428
the night his brother
was killed.

01:14.470 --> 01:15.789
He was in fear
for his life.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.467
He remains in fear for his life.

01:17.510 --> 01:20.229
I'm just saying
there is no actual proof

01:20.280 --> 01:21.838
that Shinwell pulled
the trigger.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.609
So it's Damon's word
against his.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.470
We don't even know Damon
at all.

01:25.510 --> 01:27.774
Not like we know Shinwell.
Do we know him?

01:27.820 --> 01:29.583
Damon Clark has agreed

01:29.620 --> 01:33.181
to give a statement to
Detective Guzman this afternoon.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.551
I recommend you join them.

01:34.590 --> 01:36.251
Hear his testimony
firsthand,

01:36.290 --> 01:38.178
look him in the eye
when he tells his story.

01:38.230 --> 01:40.824
_ And then tell me
If you're not convmced.

01:44.530 --> 01:45.861
Unit 1056,

01:45.900 --> 01:48.289
Several dozen boxes,
contents unknown.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.329
Bidding starts at $100.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.304
100.
400.

01:51.340 --> 01:53.137
Why so aggressive?
You got a tip?

01:53.180 --> 01:55.501
Counter or don't, kid.
600.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.144
600. Do I hear 700?

01:57.180 --> 01:58.909
700.
Got 700, now 800.

01:58.950 --> 02:00.178
Who's in for 800?

02:00.220 --> 02:01.778
700 going once.

02:01.820 --> 02:03.515
700 going twice...
1,000.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.609
1,000.
Do we have 1,100?

02:05.650 --> 02:07.151
Too rich for me.

02:07.190 --> 02:08.418
Going once, going twice.

02:08.460 --> 02:12.157
Sold to Xavier for 1,000.

02:14.430 --> 02:17.558
You want to stick around,
see what you missed out on?

02:21.440 --> 02:23.806
Come on...

02:23.840 --> 02:25.467
Waterford Crystal.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.169
Midnight Ranger number one.

02:31.480 --> 02:34.244
You hit the
jackpot, kid.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.542
Hey, check that cabinet,

02:35.580 --> 02:37.445
would you?

02:45.890 --> 02:49.428
Hey!
You just bought that.

02:49.470 --> 02:53.236
Yeah, well...
you just bought that.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.374
*

03:07.720 --> 03:09.210
BELL:
The guy who rented this unit

03:09.250 --> 03:11.810
stopped paying his bill
a couple months ago.

03:11.850 --> 03:13.613
Now we know why.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.911
We think that's him?

03:14.960 --> 03:16.780
The manager here's
pretty sure.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.559
Thing is, when I ran the ID.

03:18.590 --> 03:20.319
the_ renter used
on hIs application,

03:20.360 --> 03:22.999
it came back to a who_ died
In a Single-vehicle accrdent

03:23.030 --> 03:24.725
two years ago.

03:24.770 --> 03:26.897
So whoever that is,
he didn't want his real name

03:26.940 --> 03:28.896
attached to this place.

03:28.940 --> 03:31.738
So he's not just a
mummy, he's a John Doe.

03:31.770 --> 03:35.570
The body was stuffed
into that cabinet.

03:35.610 --> 03:37.749
It's air-tight, which is why
no one smelled him.

03:37.780 --> 03:39.441
I presume that
you noticed

03:39.480 --> 03:42.278
the identical entry
and exit wounds on his torso?

03:42.320 --> 03:45.414
BELL: Yeah, like he was stabbed
clean through with something.

03:45.450 --> 03:46.678
With a sword, most likely.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.017
Easy to imagine
a trove like this

03:48.060 --> 03:49.789
containing an antique one.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.923
The killer might have grabbed it
in the heat of the moment.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.326
Yeah, well, whatever it was,
he took it with him.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.657
And yet it betrayed him.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.964
Despite what the
motion picture industry

03:58.000 --> 04:00.491
would have us believe,
it is not easy

04:00.540 --> 04:03.008
to pierce skin,
ribs, and muscle

04:03.040 --> 04:04.564
in a single thrust.

04:04.610 --> 04:05.736
So we're looking for someone

04:05.770 --> 04:07.306
with a lot
of upper body strength.

04:07.340 --> 04:09.877
I say we should go
and look for a guy like that

04:09.910 --> 04:11.548
on the security footage
for this place,

04:11.580 --> 04:12.877
only there isn't any.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.480
One of the downsides
of keeping your stuff

04:15.520 --> 04:17.738
in the cheapest storage
facility in town.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.485
It's an upside if you're
a thief.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.408
Pretty sure
this wasn't a robbery.

04:21.460 --> 04:22.859
According to the guys
who found the body,

04:22.890 --> 04:25.358
the killer left
a small fortune behind.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.425
No, I wasn't talking
about our killer,

04:26.460 --> 04:27.620
I was alluding the the thefts

04:27.660 --> 04:29.890
committed by our victim,
John Doe.

04:29.930 --> 04:32.990
He keeps a small fortune in a
facility without any cameras.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.838
He uses a stolen ID
to rent a unIt

04:35.870 --> 04:37.633
in the furthest corner
of the building.

04:37.670 --> 04:39.331
He's a thief if
ever there was one.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.779
There's a good chance
at least some of the owners

04:40.810 --> 04:41.777
filed police reports,
right?

04:41.810 --> 04:43.505
Wrong.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.041
Unless the NYPD maintains a
robbery squad in the hereafter.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.514
All of these items
have been labeled

04:48.550 --> 04:49.517
with their owners'
real names.

04:49.550 --> 04:50.847
What do they have in common?

04:50.890 --> 04:52.482
They're dead.

04:52.520 --> 04:53.487
They all died
of natural causes

04:53.520 --> 04:55.511
in and around New York

04:55.560 --> 04:56.720
within the last two years.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.320
Note, none of their
obituaries

04:59.360 --> 05:01.055
have any mention
of any heirs,

05:01.100 --> 05:02.727
And they all contain
the same phone number

05:02.770 --> 05:05.796
to call should the reader feel
that he or she

05:05.830 --> 05:08.833
has a claim
over the decedent's estate.

05:08.870 --> 05:11.100
That's the Manhattan Public
Administrator's Office.

05:11.140 --> 05:13.836
They protect the assets of
people who die with no will.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.802
You think our victim
worked for them?

05:15.840 --> 05:17.979
Who better to steal
from the dead than the person

05:18.010 --> 05:21.070
charged with sorting
through their possessions?

05:21.120 --> 05:25.409
That's Travis?
W-What happened to him?

05:25.450 --> 05:27.350
What happened is
he was murdered.

05:27.390 --> 05:29.858
What?
HOLMES: Mr. Salas,

05:29.890 --> 05:31.687
your supervisor at the Public
Administrator's Office

05:31.730 --> 05:33.357
not only helped us to confirm

05:33.400 --> 05:35.095
that this was Travis Unger,
but she also told us

05:35.130 --> 05:36.859
that the two of you
were partners.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.596
Or at least you were until
he disappeared two months ago.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.993
WATSON: His body was
discovered in a storage unit

05:41.040 --> 05:42.701
in Canarsie.

05:42.740 --> 05:46.471
The unit was filled with stolen
items from dead people,

05:46.510 --> 05:49.479
specifically the dead people
the two of you

05:49.510 --> 05:50.704
were assigned to look into.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.377
BELL: The city requires
P.A. investigators

05:52.420 --> 05:54.911
to work in pairs
to prevent theft.

05:54.950 --> 05:56.986
So either you were
asleep on the job,

05:57.020 --> 05:58.385
or you were helping Travis.

05:58.420 --> 05:59.580
We're thinking
you were partners

05:59.620 --> 06:01.451
in work and crime,

06:01.490 --> 06:02.889
only something went south.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.818
Maybe Travis was keeping
more than his share?

06:04.860 --> 06:06.589
Wait, wait, wait.
You're right about Travis

06:06.630 --> 06:08.689
stealing from people, okay?

06:08.730 --> 06:10.789
He'd throw me a few hundred
bucks every now and then

06:10.830 --> 06:12.764
to look the other way.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.689
I'd go watch a movie, and
leave him in people's places,

06:15.740 --> 06:17.469
but that was it.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.000
I wasn't his partner,
and I didn't kill him.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.405
I didn't even know
he was dead

06:20.440 --> 06:21.873
until you showed me
these pictures.

06:21.910 --> 06:24.447
So you're not a killer,
and you're not a thief.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.640
Just a guy who doesn't mind
a friend

06:25.680 --> 06:26.840
ripping off the dead.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.043
I-I know how that sounds,

06:30.090 --> 06:32.046
but the people
you're talking about,

06:32.090 --> 06:33.648
half the time
the P.A.'s Office

06:33.690 --> 06:35.681
doesn't find heirs for them.

06:35.720 --> 06:39.554
They sell their stuff, and
the proceeds go to the state.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.522
Travis always thought
that was crazy.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.619
We do all the work,
New York gets all the money.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.491
Admitting that you were
profiting from his exploits

06:46.540 --> 06:48.030
doesn't really make you
any less of a suspect

06:48.070 --> 06:50.163
in his murder, so...

06:50.210 --> 06:53.008
The first day Travis didn't
come into work

06:53.040 --> 06:54.530
was January 27.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.445
I remember because
our boss called me,

06:56.480 --> 06:57.879
wanted to know
ifI heard from him.

06:57.910 --> 07:01.641
So? _
So I was on a_crurse
With my wnfe.

07:01.680 --> 07:04.547
I had been there
for almost a week.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.184
That means the last_time
TraVIs was seen alive,

07:07.220 --> 07:09.780
I was out on a boat
in the middle of the Pacific.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.980
I'm gonna need the name
of the cruise line.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.134
You can start writing now.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.532
Sorry, it's just...

07:23.570 --> 07:26.539
I remember when my boss called,

07:26.580 --> 07:28.571
I wasn't worried.

07:28.610 --> 07:29.770
What does that mean?

07:29.810 --> 07:32.244
Before he disappeared,

07:32.280 --> 07:34.544
Travis left me a message.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.684
Said he found something
from our last clear-out

07:36.720 --> 07:38.540
that was gonna make him rich.

07:38.590 --> 07:40.217
When he stopped
coming into work,

07:40.260 --> 07:43.559
I figured it was because he
was sitting on a beach somewhere

07:43.590 --> 07:45.581
drinking mai tais.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.126
Well, whatever he took...

07:50.170 --> 07:53.059
maybe it was too hot to handle.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.863
Got him killed.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.094
You don't know what it was?

07:56.140 --> 07:57.937
No.

07:57.970 --> 08:02.669
But I know it came from the home
of the last heirless person

08:02.710 --> 08:04.246
we were assigned to.

08:04.280 --> 08:07.169
Uh, guy's name is Milton Barker.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.712
Whatever Travis didn't take
would have gotten boxed up

08:10.750 --> 08:11.944
and sent to the warehouse.

08:11.990 --> 08:13.116
Warehouse?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.014
The P.A.'s warehouse.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.051
If you die
without a will or heirs,

08:17.090 --> 08:20.059
your stuff gets sent there
while we investigate.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.568
Look at Milton Barker's stuff.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.125
Maybe you could figure out
what's missing.

08:25.170 --> 08:27.764
BELL: Am I the only one
keeping an eye out

08:27.800 --> 08:30.030
for the lost
Ark of the Covenant?

08:30.070 --> 08:32.265
Nah, that's in a
warehouse in Yemen.

08:32.310 --> 08:33.834
I was joking.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.677
So was I.

08:35.710 --> 08:38.747
Crate 10997--
last earthly possessions

08:38.780 --> 08:41.248
of Milton Barker.
Or at least _
the last earthly possessmns

08:41.280 --> 08:43.248
that weren't stolen
by TraVIs Unger.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.985
Says here
Mr. Barker was

08:45.020 --> 08:47.181
an insurance adjustor,
died of a stroke, age 86,

08:47.220 --> 08:48.585
no known heirs.

08:48.620 --> 08:50.759
So, how do you open this?

08:51.960 --> 08:53.757
I don't.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.257
BELL:
So far,

08:56.300 --> 09:01.033
I'd say the only thing missing
is a tie to go with this shirt.

09:01.070 --> 09:02.708
Is that an antique?

09:02.740 --> 09:06.232
Easily. This is an
18th century sea chest.

09:06.270 --> 09:08.602
Sailors used to keep their
personal effects inside.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.039
Judging by the look
of this one,

09:10.080 --> 09:12.048
it belonged to a person
of quite some standing.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.071
Ship's captain, perhaps.

09:21.820 --> 09:22.957
Hmm.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.839
Emerson Barker.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.664
No doubt an ancestor of Milton.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.198
(sniffing)
Mmm.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.206
You smell something?

09:45.250 --> 09:48.014
It's vanilla
with an almond finish.

09:48.050 --> 09:49.347
The odor is created
by the breakdown

09:49.380 --> 09:51.041
of cellulose and lignin,

09:51.090 --> 09:52.887
two of the components of paper.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.683
It's what gives old books
their smell.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.688
And yet...

09:56.730 --> 10:00.097
There's no old book in there.
Mm. Judging by
its placement

10:00.130 --> 10:03.896
inside a captain's chest,
I'll bet it was a captain's log.

10:03.930 --> 10:06.933
Might also be
what Travis Unger stole.

10:06.970 --> 10:09.962
Okay. But if he thought Emerson
Barker's stuff was valuable,

10:10.010 --> 10:11.329
why not take it all?

10:11.370 --> 10:13.133
Why just the log?

10:14.980 --> 10:16.902
DAMON:
I had just fallen asleep

10:16.950 --> 10:20.078
when their voices
woke me up.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.247
Shinwell and my brother.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.044
They were laughing,
I don't know about what.

10:25.090 --> 10:27.115
I heard
the refrigerator door open,

10:27.160 --> 10:29.185
and then all of a sudden...

10:29.220 --> 10:32.087
three gunshots.

10:32.130 --> 10:35.657
(smacks lips) Pop, pop, pop,
like firecrackers.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.918
And I hid in my room

10:37.970 --> 10:39.790
until I heard the
front door close,

10:39.840 --> 10:41.865
and I went out...

10:41.900 --> 10:46.166
and I saw Jameel
on the kitchen floor.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.901
Blood everywhere.

10:52.450 --> 10:54.748
And, uh, Shinwell
was gone.

10:54.780 --> 10:58.716
I thought that maybe
he had ran after the killer.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.388
I mean...

11:00.420 --> 11:03.423
him and Jameel
were like brothers.

11:03.460 --> 11:07.191
But then H looked
out the window and...

11:07.230 --> 11:10.290
Iwwmmm

11:10.330 --> 11:11.422
walking.

11:11.470 --> 11:14.439
Not running, walking.

11:14.470 --> 11:17.166
And he stopped to throw
something in a garbage can,

11:17.210 --> 11:20.031
and then he just...

11:20.080 --> 11:22.469
walked away.

11:22.510 --> 11:25.377
And I-I don't know why,
but I-I-I...

11:25.410 --> 11:27.469
I ran outside and, um,

11:27.520 --> 11:31.240
I went to the garbage can
and I put my hand in it

11:31.290 --> 11:33.918
and then
H reached around and...

11:33.960 --> 11:35.188
and that's when I found it.

11:35.220 --> 11:37.188
Found what?

11:37.230 --> 11:40.119
The gun.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.958
The gun he used to kill Jameel.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.262
GUZMAN: Only,

11:44.300 --> 11:45.392
instead of giving the gun

11:45.430 --> 11:46.465
to the authorities, you kept it.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.728
Why?

11:47.770 --> 11:49.829
Because I needed a gun.

11:49.870 --> 11:50.802
To do what?

11:50.840 --> 11:53.206
Kill Shinwell.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.403
I heard he was going
to be at the funeral,

11:56.440 --> 11:58.101
so I brought it with me.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.345
I was gonna do it right there,

12:00.380 --> 12:02.848
right in front of Jameel.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.812
But you didn't.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.512
(sniffles)

12:08.560 --> 12:10.084
I was ten.

12:12.090 --> 12:15.127
I-I thought I was gonna
get another chance, but then--

12:15.160 --> 12:18.391
but then Shinwell got sent
upstate and that was that.

12:18.430 --> 12:20.330
Until a few nights ago.

12:20.370 --> 12:22.861
Yeah, I, uh,

12:22.910 --> 12:25.367
I heard he got out
and started rolling with SBK

12:25.410 --> 12:27.230
like nothing ever happened.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.341
I owed it to Jameel
to try again.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.245
But I missed.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.374
And after that, I threw the gun
into the East River.

12:38.950 --> 12:40.815
I guess I'm no killer.

12:42.830 --> 12:45.025
But Shinwell sure as hell is.

12:48.030 --> 12:49.861
(door opens)

12:49.900 --> 12:51.322
Oh...

12:51.370 --> 12:52.394
(keys jingle)

12:52.430 --> 12:53.897
Damon Clark's story

12:53.940 --> 12:55.965
rang as true for you
as it did for me.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.059
I'm sorry.

12:58.110 --> 13:01.102
Pretty sure I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

13:01.140 --> 13:03.142
I let a killer into our lives.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.444
It's not like I haven't exposed
you to the occasional killer.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.516
What did Detective
Guzman have to say?

13:07.550 --> 13:09.313
Not much, actually.

13:09.350 --> 13:11.386
_ He doesn't think the DA.
IS gonna want to pursue It.

13:11.420 --> 13:13.513
Hmm.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.551
Damon is an unreliable witness,
at best.

13:15.590 --> 13:18.423
And Shinwell has proven himself
to be a strong informant.

13:18.460 --> 13:19.552
So now what?

13:19.590 --> 13:21.990
Now, we take a respite.

13:22.030 --> 13:24.123
There is a more recent murder
demands our attention.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.592
Oh, yeah,
I got your text earlier.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.860
So you think
that Unger stole an old book

13:27.900 --> 13:29.037
from a sea chest?

13:29.070 --> 13:31.038
Not a book, a captain's log.

13:31.070 --> 13:32.901
I initially thought
the log to be that

13:32.940 --> 13:35.534
of Captain Emerson Barker,
the chest's original owner.

13:35.580 --> 13:36.535
Only it wasn't?

13:36.580 --> 13:37.547
A little research
revealed

13:37.580 --> 13:39.309
that Captain Emerson Barker

13:39.350 --> 13:41.341
ran rum and sugar between
the West Indies and New York

13:41.380 --> 13:43.541
from 1692 to 1705.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.184
His tenure
was notably uneventful,

13:46.220 --> 13:48.609
and yet,
every single one of his logbooks

13:48.660 --> 13:51.083
ended up in the archives of
the New York Public Library.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.098
Thei_r collection covers
his entire career.

13:53.130 --> 13:54.495
That is, in fact,

13:54.530 --> 13:56.293
the only thing
that is noteworthy about them.

13:56.330 --> 13:59.629
There aren't any
missing volumes.

13:59.670 --> 14:01.968
So if you're right that
Travis Unger stole something

14:02.000 --> 14:04.036
from Barker's chest,

14:04.070 --> 14:06.061
it had to have been
some other kind of book.

14:06.110 --> 14:08.431
No. I remain convinced
it was a captain's log.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.038
But you just said...

14:10.080 --> 14:12.173
Come.

14:12.210 --> 14:15.111
Pages from the logbooks
of Captain Emerson Barker,

14:15.150 --> 14:18.586
courtesy of the New York Public
Library's online archives.

14:18.620 --> 14:21.088
Now, these entries

14:21.120 --> 14:23.918
represent one week aboard
Captain Emerson's ship,

14:23.960 --> 14:25.359
recorded in his own hand.

14:25.390 --> 14:27.597
Now, he, like everyone else
in Colonial times,

14:27.630 --> 14:29.052
wrote with ink and quill.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.988
Captain Barker would
have had to mix

14:31.030 --> 14:32.463
fresh ink every day.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.263
Therefore, one would expect

14:34.300 --> 14:36.905
each entry
to be slightly different

14:36.940 --> 14:38.305
in shade
and con5istency.

14:38.340 --> 14:39.978
These all look the same.

14:40.010 --> 14:41.375
That's because three to four
times a year,

14:41.410 --> 14:44.902
Captain Barker
used the same ink mixture

14:44.950 --> 14:47.544
to write several w_eeks' worth
of entries in a Single day.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.172
You think he was making them up?

14:49.220 --> 14:50.983
Oh, I know he was.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.578
I've compared his writings
to the logs of other ships

14:52.620 --> 14:54.952
that were supposedly near his
at the time of these entries.

14:54.990 --> 14:57.424
And the weather data
doesn't match. Why?

14:57.460 --> 14:59.655
Because his data is fabricated.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.453
Why would he do something
like that?

15:01.500 --> 15:05.129
Shortly before you returned,
I discovered that

15:05.170 --> 15:07.263
his missing weeks overlap
with attacks on ships at sea,

15:07.300 --> 15:11.361
by a pirate named
"Black Peter."

15:11.410 --> 15:12.661
Wait a second. Are you saying

15:12.710 --> 15:14.530
that Emerson Barker
was a pirate?

15:14.580 --> 15:17.140
More specifically,
a part-time pirate.

15:17.180 --> 15:19.068
He and his crew
led a double life.

15:19.110 --> 15:20.418
When they weren't hauling
their own cargo,

15:20.450 --> 15:22.008
they were relieving other ships
of theirs.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.142
Quite clever,
when you think about it.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.145
(chuckles)

15:24.190 --> 15:25.487
Okay, say you're right.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.010
What does all this have to do
with Travis Unger?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.379
A pirate captain
is still a captain.

15:28.420 --> 15:29.956
Still needs to record
weather conditions,

15:29.990 --> 15:31.981
latitude, longitude,
profit shares.

15:32.030 --> 15:34.248
He still needs to keep a log.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.689
So, you think that's the book
that Travis Unger stole.

15:36.730 --> 15:38.027
Throughout his career,
Black Peter

15:38.070 --> 15:40.163
raided dozens
of Spanish galleons

15:40.200 --> 15:41.565
loaded with gold.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.364
Lore has it he hid the booty
in New York City.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.230
No one knows
what happened to it.

15:46.270 --> 15:49.000
But it's quite possible
that he recorded its location

15:49.040 --> 15:51.099
in his secret logbook.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.209
The same logbook
our victim stole.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.544
Unger told his partner
that he found something

15:57.590 --> 15:59.444
that was gonna make him rich.

15:59.490 --> 16:03.529
I'd say a treasure map
fits the bill, wouldn't you?

16:03.560 --> 16:06.358
(sighs)

16:13.700 --> 16:16.066
Pirate treasure in New York?

16:16.100 --> 16:17.101
Piracy was actually a vital part

16:17.140 --> 16:18.107
of the Colonial economy.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.779
Many a privateer roamed
Manhattan's streets

16:20.810 --> 16:23.244
squandering their stolen
doubloons on wine and wenches.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.339
And never a place to turn away
a good customer,

16:25.380 --> 16:27.211
the city welcomed them
with open arms.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.514
Much as they do the pirates
that roam Wall Street today.

16:29.550 --> 16:32.087
Oh, well, let's say
this, uh, Black Peter

16:32.120 --> 16:33.155
did bury some gold somewhere
in the city.

16:33.190 --> 16:34.657
Don't you think someone
would've found it by now?

16:34.690 --> 16:38.080
We did some research,
and we're pretty sure

16:38.130 --> 16:40.291
this is not about
Black Peter's personal treasure.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.252
HOLMES: According to
historical records,

16:42.300 --> 16:44.495
Emerson Barker,
AKA Black Peter,

16:44.530 --> 16:46.760
invested his loot
into the South Sea Company,

16:46.800 --> 16:48.290
which famously went bankrupt
in 1720.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.661
But according to
historians who are

16:50.710 --> 16:53.133
familiar with his exploits,
Black Peter also claimed to know

16:53.180 --> 16:54.636
the location
of a different treasure,

16:54.680 --> 16:57.444
a lost fortune he was never able
to get his hands on.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.300
Right now,
we're operating on the theory

16:59.350 --> 17:01.318
that the stolen logbook
contains the location

17:01.350 --> 17:02.510
of that treasure.

17:02.550 --> 17:03.710
So, what, we should put out

17:03.750 --> 17:05.741
a Finest Message for a giant "X"

17:05.790 --> 17:07.212
on a sidewalk?

17:07.260 --> 17:09.148
50 paces from the old oak tree?

17:09.190 --> 17:11.124
Actually, we don't think
the treasure was buried.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.627
We think it might be underwater.

17:12.660 --> 17:15.493
I pulled Travis Unger's
credit records.

17:15.530 --> 17:17.725
One of the last places he
used his card was a bar

17:17.770 --> 17:19.260
called The Salty Bog.

17:19.300 --> 17:20.767
It's near the South
Brooklyn Marine Terminal,

17:20.800 --> 17:22.495
it's a popular hangout
for scuba divers

17:22.540 --> 17:24.303
and marine salvagers.

17:24.340 --> 17:26.604
If Unger had discovered the
location of the sunken treasure,

17:26.640 --> 17:27.436
he would've needed help

17:27.480 --> 17:29.675
from someone
with the right skills

17:29.710 --> 17:31.348
and resources to retrieve it.

17:31.380 --> 17:33.109
GREGSON: The bar
would be a good place

17:33.150 --> 17:34.447
to look for a partner.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.841
BELL: A bartender
at The Salty Bog told us

17:37.890 --> 17:40.108
Travis Unger came in
a couple months ago,

17:40.160 --> 17:41.286
looking for someone who could
help him get to a ship

17:41.320 --> 17:42.287
at the bottom of the ocean.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.582
He said he
pointed Unger

17:43.630 --> 17:45.450
in your direction,
Mr. Vestergaard.

17:45.490 --> 17:47.151
Yeah, that's right.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.828
He said he had a logbook
that belonged to Black Peter.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.566
You know who that is?

17:51.600 --> 17:53.431
He said the logbook
contained the location

17:53.470 --> 17:54.869
of a sunken Spanish galleon

17:54.900 --> 17:56.765
called the Santa Leticia in it.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.404
The Santa Leticia
supposedly went down

17:58.440 --> 18:00.237
with a fortune
of gold onboard.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.475
He wanted me to provide a ship
and the labor to pull it up.

18:02.510 --> 18:04.705
Offered to split the take
fifty-fifty.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.604
I told him I wasn't interested.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.345
You're an ardent
treasure hunter.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.711
According to
an interview,

18:09.750 --> 18:11.445
you only operate your
commercial salvage business

18:11.490 --> 18:13.583
to fund your expeditions.
So why would you turn down

18:13.620 --> 18:16.111
the lead to a potential fortune
in gold?

18:17.760 --> 18:20.422
VESTERGAARD: Something happened
to this guy, right?

18:20.460 --> 18:23.361
Is that why you're here?
You think I did it?

18:23.400 --> 18:24.628
WATSON: Travis
Unger was murdered

18:24.670 --> 18:26.194
the day after the
two of you met.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.733
BELL: Maybe you wanted
Black Peter's logbook,

18:28.770 --> 18:30.328
but you didn't want
to split the treasure.

18:30.370 --> 18:31.906
So you killed Travis
and took the book.

18:31.940 --> 18:34.875
I mean, you are accustomed
to looting the dead, after all.

18:34.910 --> 18:36.775
No.

18:36.810 --> 18:39.608
No, you-you got the wrong guy.
I didn't kill anyone.

18:39.650 --> 18:41.515
Look, I turned him down
because I already knew

18:41.550 --> 18:43.279
the location
of the Santa Leticia.

18:45.620 --> 18:48.748
I first found out about
the Santa Leticia in 2013

18:48.790 --> 18:51.224
when I was digging through
some old files in Seville.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.751
It took me years,
but I finally found her.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.360
Very next day, I applied
with the Admiralty Courts

18:56.400 --> 18:58.322
for salvage title,
which they granted.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.237
Over a year ago, long before
I ever met Travis Unger.

19:01.270 --> 19:04.603
All right, well,
we're gonna have to verify this.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.609
Feel free. I'll give you numbers
of some of my investors, too.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.403
Investors?

19:09.440 --> 19:11.704
_ The Santa Leticia_ is
in deep water, half a mile down.

19:11.750 --> 19:12.876
That kind of salvage job

19:12.910 --> 19:14.844
costs about
a million dollars.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.542
I had already sold 50%
of the treasure to my investors.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.716
If I'd given him 50%,

19:18.750 --> 19:20.581
I would've been left
with nothing.

19:20.620 --> 19:23.225
And besides, there's a DVD
in the back of that ﬁle.

19:23.260 --> 19:25.251
It shows video of us
when we finally made it

19:25.290 --> 19:27.292
to the Santa Leticia
about two weeks ago.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.218
It's proof that somebody else

19:29.260 --> 19:30.818
ended up
with Black Peter's logbook.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.191
Because when my crew
and I got down there,

19:33.240 --> 19:35.458
that ship had been picked clean.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.206
Based on the condition
of the wreck,

19:37.240 --> 19:39.299
someone beat us to the gold
by days.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.535
Weeks, at most.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.969
So you think Travis Unger tried
to partner with someone else.

19:44.010 --> 19:45.671
That person killed him,
took the book,

19:45.710 --> 19:47.644
and got to the Santa Leticia
before you?

19:47.680 --> 19:49.648
Yeah, you want to find
who killed Travis Unger?

19:49.680 --> 19:53.411
I'd start by finding the people
who stole my treasure.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.759
BELL:
Thanks. That'll do the trick.

19:56.790 --> 19:59.281
The National Weather Service
says they'll send us

19:59.330 --> 20:01.298
the last two months
of satellite footage

20:01.330 --> 20:02.854
covering the coordinates
Mr. Vestergaard gave us.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.765
HOLMES: Should be easy
enough to spot a vessel

20:04.800 --> 20:06.358
which anchored above
the Santa Leticia

20:06.400 --> 20:07.890
long enough
to loot her.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.568
Keep me posted,
would you?

20:10.610 --> 20:11.759
Where are you going?

20:11.810 --> 20:13.732
The respite I mentioned
last night?

20:13.780 --> 20:14.929
It's over.

20:26.950 --> 20:28.656
You know I don't like it
when you do this.

20:28.690 --> 20:29.816
Nobody does.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.693
What's up?
What did I do?

20:34.730 --> 20:36.595
Did I miss an appointment
or something?

20:36.630 --> 20:38.791
I require information.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.468
About?

20:40.500 --> 20:42.297
A murder.

20:42.340 --> 20:43.409
What are you talking about?

20:43.440 --> 20:45.499
I know you killed Jameel Clark.

20:48.080 --> 20:52.301
What I don't know is why.

20:52.350 --> 20:54.978
I told you everything I know
about what happened to Jameel.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.840
You told me everything
you wanted me to know.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.587
You left out the bits about
shooting him in the back,

20:59.620 --> 21:01.759
dropping the weapon
in a garbage can.

21:01.790 --> 21:06.625
Believe it or not, I'm here
because I want to help you.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.491
Do tell.

21:08.530 --> 21:12.364
12 years ago,
you made a mistake.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.662
Now obviously, you regret it.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.367
Or you wouldn't have become an
informant for the department.

21:18.410 --> 21:21.038
You wouldn't have devoted
yourself to dismantling SBK.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.036
Hmm?

21:23.080 --> 21:25.048
You're not the man you were.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.969
That could not be more plain.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.511
But the truth must out.

21:31.690 --> 21:34.682
So tell me what happened
that night, hmm?

21:36.060 --> 21:39.052
What drove you to
take Jameel's life?

21:39.090 --> 21:41.650
I loved Jameel.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.497
Like he was a brother.

21:43.530 --> 21:45.919
So why did you shoot him
three times in the back?

21:45.970 --> 21:47.665
You know what?
I think you should leave.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.065
You have a relationship
with the police,

21:49.100 --> 21:53.332
and with the district attorney.

21:53.380 --> 21:56.076
You must realize that there's a
deal to be made if you confess.

21:56.110 --> 21:58.044
There's nothing to confess.

21:59.450 --> 22:00.747
So, if you don't mind...

22:00.780 --> 22:02.418
You're making a mistake.

22:02.450 --> 22:04.008
No, the mistake is yours.

22:04.050 --> 22:06.018
I didn't kill anybody.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.752
It's good luck you caught me.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.621
I was planning to set sail
for Sardinia tomorrow morning.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.433
So...

22:20.470 --> 22:22.768
how can I help the NYPD?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.700
Well, last month,
a sunken treasure ship

22:24.740 --> 22:27.004
named the Santa Leticia
was looted,

22:27.040 --> 22:29.907
and satellite photos
show your yacht,

22:29.940 --> 22:31.100
the Sea Unicorn, anchored
at the coordinates

22:31.150 --> 22:32.970
for well over a week.

22:33.010 --> 22:35.843
We know you consider yourself
an amateur treasure hunter,

22:35.880 --> 22:38.144
and that you maintain a
private collection of the things

22:38.190 --> 22:41.011
that you've found over the
years at your home in Riyadh.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.755
So tell us,

22:42.790 --> 22:44.883
if we get a warrant
to search your ship,

22:44.930 --> 22:48.388
are we gonna find the
Santa Leticia's gold onboard?

22:48.430 --> 22:49.920
Absolutely.

22:52.630 --> 22:55.064
You don't deny
looting the treasure?

22:55.100 --> 22:56.590
Not at all.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.505
Would you like to see a sample?

22:58.540 --> 23:00.531
Actually, that would
be very helpful.

23:02.610 --> 23:04.999
I carry this one with me
for good luck.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.678
It's the first one found by my
divers and very precious to me.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.416
But you're more than welcome
to come to the ship to see

23:10.450 --> 23:12.418
the rest of the treasure.
You don't
happen to have

23:12.450 --> 23:15.783
a logbook there written by a man
named Black Peter, do you?

23:15.820 --> 23:17.117
It's with the rest
of the treasure.

23:18.730 --> 23:19.879
You know Black Peter?

23:19.930 --> 23:22.490
He is_one_
of my favorite pirates.

23:22.530 --> 23:24.521
Mr. Al-Asmari,

23:24.570 --> 23:26.663
that logbook was once
in the possession

23:26.700 --> 23:30.158
of a man by the name
of Travis Unger.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.998
He was looking for a partner
to help retrieve

23:33.040 --> 23:35.600
the treasure. He was offering
a fifty-fifty split.

23:35.640 --> 23:36.607
Ah.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.608
But he was murdered.

23:38.650 --> 23:41.448
And now you're admitting
to having

23:41.480 --> 23:43.687
his book and the treasure.

23:43.720 --> 23:46.712
I'm sorry to hear
that this man is dead,

23:46.750 --> 23:49.457
but I've never seen him before.

23:49.490 --> 23:51.128
And I certainly
would not have killed him

23:51.160 --> 23:53.651
to find the location
of Santa Leticia.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.918
Why would I?

23:55.960 --> 23:57.791
This is a million-dollar watch.

23:57.830 --> 23:59.525
My shoes cost $5,000.

23:59.570 --> 24:02.095
I have more money
than I know what to do with.

24:02.140 --> 24:04.836
I don't need to steal
or kill to get what I want.

24:04.870 --> 24:08.237
I'd have happily shared the
treasure with this Travis Unger.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.236
He never approached me.

24:10.280 --> 24:13.670
If you never met him, where did
you get Black Peter's logbook?

24:13.720 --> 24:14.812
I bought it.

24:14.850 --> 24:15.771
From?

24:15.820 --> 24:17.845
I don't know.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.642
I made the purchase
on the Dark Web.

24:19.690 --> 24:21.112
The seller wished
to remain anonymous.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.720
I paid 25,000 American dollars.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.820
Travis Unger wanted 50% of
a treasure worth millions.

24:26.860 --> 24:30.569
There's no way he sold
the logbook for $25,000.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.124
You think I bought the logbook

24:33.170 --> 24:35.092
from the man
who killed this man.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.565
But the transaction was made

24:39.610 --> 24:42.932
entirely via screen names
and encrypted e-mails.

24:42.980 --> 24:45.244
Do you at least remember
his screen name?

24:45.280 --> 24:46.975
Of course.

24:47.010 --> 24:49.240
It was Kashgar.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.579
Like the city on the Silk Road.

24:55.590 --> 24:57.888
(keys clacking)

25:06.800 --> 25:08.961
Mason?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.104
Hey.

25:11.140 --> 25:13.165
I take it the partially melted
statue of Coatlicue,

25:13.210 --> 25:14.837
the Aztec earth goddess,

25:14.880 --> 25:16.836
has something to do with
the hunt for a Dark Web dealer

25:16.880 --> 25:18.848
who sold a pirate's logbook
to a Saudi billionaire?

25:18.880 --> 25:22.714
His name is Kashgar, and
Joan is totally catfishing him.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.183
Thanks.

25:24.220 --> 25:26.711
I figure Kashgar either killed
Travis Unger himself

25:26.750 --> 25:27.910
or knows the person who did.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.882
So I came up with a plan
to identify him.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.683
We bought that statue
from Kashgar.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.698
Well, actually,
not that statue.

25:33.730 --> 25:35.550
That's a fake.
We bought a real one though.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.953
It's in the basement.
I asked Mason

25:37.000 --> 25:38.627
to use one
of the 3-D industrial printers

25:38.670 --> 25:39.819
from his university
to make a copy.

25:39.870 --> 25:42.031
Since when are you
at university?

25:42.070 --> 25:44.106
Since I turned 15. Duh.

25:44.140 --> 25:45.960
We melted one of the statue's
hands to try to conVInce Kashgar

25:46.010 --> 25:49.002
that he sold us a fake
by accident.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.849
See?

25:50.880 --> 25:52.848
Why did you make
a video?

25:52.880 --> 25:54.973
'Cause we want Kashgar
to watch it.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.272
Which, according to this,
he just did.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.880
Mason embedded a Trojan
horse in the video.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.184
By watching it, Kashgar
is giving us his IP address.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.927
Got it. Now all I have to do is

26:04.960 --> 26:07.758
match the address
to a name. And...

26:08.830 --> 26:10.127
Bam.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.889
HOLMES:
John Neligan.

26:11.930 --> 26:13.761
Excuse me.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.063
WATSON:
"John Neligan.

26:20.110 --> 26:21.930
"Criminal sale of a
controlled substance.

26:21.980 --> 26:23.038
"Criminal possession
of a weapon.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.308
Assault in the first degree."

26:26.110 --> 26:28.647
(commentator
speaking indistinctly)

26:28.680 --> 26:31.342
Hope! Grab me a beer, will ya?

26:31.390 --> 26:32.812
(door slams open)

26:32.850 --> 26:34.852
Get on the ground! Now!

26:36.990 --> 26:39.356
My daughter's back there.

26:40.360 --> 26:43.352
I'm clean, man!

26:43.400 --> 26:45.220
Dad?

26:45.270 --> 26:47.226
This is a mistake, sweetheart.

26:47.270 --> 26:48.692
I didn't do anything.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.708
Mr. Neligan,

26:50.740 --> 26:52.230
Detective Bell, NYPD.

26:52.270 --> 26:54.830
Whatever tip you got,
it's bogus.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.098
I didn't violate my parole.
You can search the house.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.176
You won't find anything
that's not supposed to be here.

26:59.210 --> 27:01.110
Look, we know you've been
trafficking in stolen goods,

27:01.150 --> 27:03.710
Mr. Neligan,
including a valuable book

27:03.750 --> 27:05.183
you sold
to a Saudi businessman.

27:05.220 --> 27:06.380
What?

27:06.420 --> 27:07.910
Save it, okay?

27:07.960 --> 27:09.655
We know you're Kashgar.

27:09.690 --> 27:10.850
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.721
Who the hell is Kashgar?

27:12.760 --> 27:13.920
HOPE:
I am.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.120
My dad didn't do anything.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.752
It was me.

27:17.770 --> 27:20.796
I'm Kashgar.

27:28.110 --> 27:31.341
I came up with the whole Kashgar
thing a year and a half ago.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.814
It was a way to make money
for college.

27:33.850 --> 27:35.670
Well, ever since my dad

27:35.720 --> 27:37.244
stopped dealing,
money's been tight.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.783
Not that he gets why
I even want to go to MIT.

27:39.820 --> 27:41.310
WATSON: Do you understand
that the crimes

27:41.360 --> 27:43.681
you committed are very serious?

27:43.730 --> 27:47.325
Well, I wasn't selling drugs
or guns, like my dad used to.

27:47.360 --> 27:48.918
It was just a bunch of antiques.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.222
BELL: We're
pretty sure a man

27:50.260 --> 27:52.125
was murdered _
over one of those antiques.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.195
I told you, I don't know
anything about that.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.730
HOLMES: We're fairly confident
that you didn't murder

27:55.770 --> 27:56.737
the victim yourself.

27:56.770 --> 27:58.362
He was run through with a sword.

27:58.410 --> 28:01.334
And that takes a strong
and practiced arm.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.769
I mean, your father
could have done it.

28:03.810 --> 28:05.846
No. That's crazy.
He doesn't even own a sword.

28:07.150 --> 28:10.313
I mean,
I don't think he owns a sword.

28:10.350 --> 28:13.114
Maybe you should just tell us
how you came into possession

28:13.150 --> 28:14.913
of Black Peter's logbook.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.178
I never possessed it.

28:17.220 --> 28:19.188
I was a middleman.
That's all I ever am.

28:20.430 --> 28:21.988
People reach out to me online

28:22.030 --> 28:23.327
for help
with Dark Web transactions,

28:23.360 --> 28:24.793
usually because
they can't figure out

28:24.830 --> 28:26.058
how to do it themselves.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.397
But I never handle
the merchandise

28:27.430 --> 28:28.795
or meet with the sellers.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.899
So you just arrange the deals.

28:30.940 --> 28:33.238
A couple of months ago,
this guy reached out to me.

28:33.270 --> 28:35.738
He said that he was
a regular customer,

28:35.780 --> 28:37.270
but I didn't recognize
his screen name.

28:37.310 --> 28:39.141
That's not unusual.
The people that I deal with,

28:39.180 --> 28:40.875
they change up their info
all the time.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.808
He said he wanted my help
selling a book

28:42.850 --> 28:44.010
that used to belong
mammm.

28:44.050 --> 28:45.745
So you put it on the market
for him.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.143
No. Not exactly.

28:47.190 --> 28:48.953
He didn't actually want me
to auction it.

28:48.990 --> 28:50.252
He wanted me
to offer it directly

28:50.290 --> 28:51.518
to a guy named Farhan Al-Asmari.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.858
He said to set
the price at 25 thou.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.925
Gave me the guy's private
e-mail address and everything.

28:55.960 --> 28:58.929
He specifically wanted the book
sold to Al-Asmari?

28:58.970 --> 29:01.063
Did you think that was odd?

29:01.100 --> 29:02.431
No.

29:02.470 --> 29:04.267
I get asked
to help sell something, I do it.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.130
No questions.

29:06.170 --> 29:09.901
The odd part was that he said
I could keep all the money.

29:09.940 --> 29:13.046
Said it was a bonus
for all the work I'd done
for him in the past.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.048
He didn't end up making a penny.

29:18.450 --> 29:20.418
I don't get it.

29:20.450 --> 29:23.419
Someone kills Travis Unger
to get a pirate's logbook,

29:23.460 --> 29:25.428
and the only people
it ends up helping

29:25.460 --> 29:28.156
are a 14-year-old girl
and a Saudi billionaire.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.555
And it doesn't look like
either one of them is our perp.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.397
What if the point
wasn't to help anyone?

29:32.430 --> 29:34.034
What if it was to harm?

29:34.070 --> 29:35.435
Arranging
for Hope Neligan

29:35.470 --> 29:38.030
to pass Black Peter's logbook
to Al-Asmari

29:38.070 --> 29:40.038
didn't just profit
those two parties--

29:40.070 --> 29:43.198
it insured the utter failure
of a third, Lars Vestergaard.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.299
His expedition to the Santa
Leticia was for nothing.

29:45.350 --> 29:47.443
I mean, he didn't just miss out
on the treasure--

29:47.480 --> 29:49.311
he cost his investors millions.

29:49.350 --> 29:52.547
So what if the kil_|er's_
true goal was his rumation?

29:52.590 --> 29:55.218
I don't know. That's a long way
to go to hurt a guy's business.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.182
We'll talk_
to him again.

29:57.220 --> 29:58.482
If there's someone out there
who hates him enough

29:58.530 --> 30:01.055
to commit a murder
just to see him fail,

30:01.100 --> 30:03.967
he probably knows
the person's name, right?

30:05.630 --> 30:08.167
I admit, I had my issues
with Lars Vestergaard,

30:08.200 --> 30:10.191
but I didn't do anything
that would've harmed him

30:10.240 --> 30:12.208
or his business.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.470
We know that,
over the past ten years,

30:14.510 --> 30:17.070
you invested in a number
of his expeditions,

30:17.110 --> 30:18.941
mostly to
disappointing results.

30:18.980 --> 30:22.074
We also know you broke his nose
at the Met three months ago.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.213
During the first intermission
of Der Freischutz.

30:24.250 --> 30:26.616
It's a real shame to have missed
the final two acts.

30:26.650 --> 30:29.210
BELL: Mr. Jarman, you told
police that you were upset

30:29.260 --> 30:31.057
over treasure
hunting losses.

30:31.090 --> 30:32.489
You clearly have a grudge
against the guy.

30:32.530 --> 30:34.498
I had a grudge.

30:34.530 --> 30:35.849
Past tense.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.390
But the punch was the end of it.

30:37.430 --> 30:41.093
The truth is,
I'm a different man today.

30:41.140 --> 30:44.359
Right after the...
altercation, my firm made me

30:44.410 --> 30:46.935
take a sabbatical
to work on my anger issues.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.631
I spent the time off

30:48.680 --> 30:50.375
building houses
in Haiti.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.207
It was
life-changing.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.218
I assume
you got my name from Lars.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.377
Did he also tell you
about the pirates?

30:57.320 --> 30:59.288
Pirates?

30:59.320 --> 31:02.881
Lars likes to wine and dine his
investors on his salvage ship.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.320
About a year ago,
I was onboard late at night

31:05.360 --> 31:08.158
when he was in port,
and these men in masks,

31:08.200 --> 31:10.657
five or six of them,
came roaring up in speedboats.

31:10.700 --> 31:14.329
They jumped on board
and started wrecking his gear.

31:14.370 --> 31:16.668
By the time we got down to the
deck, they'd already sped away.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.362
But they did thousands
of dollars worth of damage.

31:19.410 --> 31:22.299
According to Lars,
it wasn't the first time.

31:22.340 --> 31:23.671
He called them pirates?

31:23.710 --> 31:25.200
No, I did.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.377
Because they were flying
a pirate flag.

31:27.410 --> 31:29.241
It had a skull
and everything.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.248
But instead
of the usual crossbones,

31:31.290 --> 31:34.453
there were two scuba snorkels.

31:34.490 --> 31:36.310
I don't know.

31:36.360 --> 31:39.352
Maybe they're the people
you're trying to find.

31:44.130 --> 31:47.122
So, what did Mr. Vestergaard
have to say this time?

31:47.170 --> 31:49.035
He confirmed
Jarman's story.

31:49.070 --> 31:51.163
He said that he'd been attacked
on four occa5ions,

31:51.210 --> 31:52.529
and that it's happened

31:52.570 --> 31:53.639
to other salvage firms,
as well.

31:53.670 --> 31:55.706
None of them
reported the attacks

31:55.740 --> 31:57.571
because they didn't want
to spook their investors.

31:57.610 --> 32:00.579
So, what kind of pirates
have a bone to pick

32:00.610 --> 32:02.111
with salvage operators?

32:02.150 --> 32:03.549
He doesn't know.

32:03.580 --> 32:05.582
Uh, were you able to find out
where that flag came from?

32:05.620 --> 32:09.283
I was. Unfortunately, uh,
ISewYourCustomFlag.com

32:09.320 --> 32:11.288
is a small online shop,

32:11.330 --> 32:13.252
and the owner doesn't sound
espeCIally organized,

32:13.290 --> 32:14.598
but she's promised
to let me know

32:14.630 --> 32:16.052
when she's located
the buyer's name and address.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.193
I found something upstairs

32:18.230 --> 32:21.097
that I would like you
to explain.

32:23.370 --> 32:25.463
SHINWELL:
So, if you don't mind...

32:25.510 --> 32:27.466
HOLMES:
You're making a mistake.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.205
SHINWELL:
No, the mistake is yours.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.276
I didn't kill anybody.

32:31.310 --> 32:34.347
When were you planning
on telling me about this?

32:34.380 --> 32:37.315
I wasn't, mostly because the
recording was my backup plan.

32:37.350 --> 32:38.681
I thought that Shinwell
might see the wisdom

32:38.720 --> 32:40.085
in turning himself in.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.109
He did not.

32:42.720 --> 32:43.755
You disapprove?

32:43.790 --> 32:45.428
Of the timing, yeah.

32:45.460 --> 32:48.224
He's worked for months
to embed himself in SBK.

32:48.260 --> 32:49.591
An endeavor I cared more about

32:49.630 --> 32:50.995
before I knew he was
a cold-blooded killer.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.497
You think we should
look the other way?

32:53.530 --> 32:55.361
SBK is a ruthless drug gang.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.561
There is no doubt _
they are the greater eVIl.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.363
So why get a confession
out of Shinwell now?

32:59.410 --> 33:01.037
Tell me, Watson,
what did you think would happen

33:01.080 --> 33:02.638
when Shinwell
and Detective Guzman

33:02.680 --> 33:04.443
finally bring
the hammer down on SBK?

33:04.480 --> 33:06.368
Do you think he would buy a
little house here, settle down?

33:06.410 --> 33:08.116
Or do you think
he would be whisked away

33:08.150 --> 33:10.038
by Witness Security,
never to be seen again?

33:10.080 --> 33:12.014
That's not what he wants. He
wants to be with his daughter.

33:12.050 --> 33:13.642
That was never gonna happen.

33:13.690 --> 33:16.011
Now that we know he killed
Jameel Clark, it shouldn't.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.521
As a physician,
you pledge to do no harm,

33:20.560 --> 33:22.152
but that's not always possible.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.020
Cutting into a patient
does them harm.

33:24.070 --> 33:26.459
Medicines have side effects,
sometimes terrible ones.

33:26.500 --> 33:29.298
With chemotherapy, we actually
give cancer patients poison,

33:29.340 --> 33:30.534
hoping that it'll kill
more malignant cells

33:30.570 --> 33:32.128
than healthy ones.

33:32.170 --> 33:33.535
So, he's the cure
to cancer now, is he?

33:33.570 --> 33:36.334
He's not the cure.
A means to an end.

33:36.380 --> 33:37.404
A necessary evil?

33:37.440 --> 33:38.600
No, just a lesser one.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.470
Several months ago,
I destroyed evidence

33:40.510 --> 33:42.171
that wo_uld've violated
his parole.

33:43.780 --> 33:46.089
so thanks to me,
a murderer now walks free.

33:46.120 --> 33:49.157
So, if he kills again, it's
gonna be on my head, not yours.

33:49.190 --> 33:50.680
The man belongs
behind bars.

33:50.720 --> 33:51.755
(cell phone chimes)

33:54.400 --> 33:55.822
Speaking of murderers,

33:55.860 --> 33:57.828
our seamstress has
the name of the person

33:57.860 --> 33:59.361
who bought the pirate flag.

34:01.470 --> 34:03.529
I don't know
what to tell you.

34:03.570 --> 34:05.401
I'm a marine archaeologist.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.067
I study pirates.

34:07.110 --> 34:08.634
Doesn't make me one.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.307
A flag just like this

34:10.340 --> 34:12.774
was commissioned by one of
your students, Isaac Sheridan.

34:12.810 --> 34:15.313
He admitted to committing
several attacks

34:15.350 --> 34:16.578
on treasure-hunting ships,

34:16.620 --> 34:18.542
including one owned
by Lars Vestergaard.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.615
HOLMES: According to
Isaac, you instructed him

34:20.650 --> 34:23.551
and several other
students when to strike

34:23.590 --> 34:25.626
and what equipment to damage
in order to cripple

34:25.660 --> 34:27.480
those companies'
salvage capabilities.

34:27.530 --> 34:29.157
People like Lars Vestergaard

34:29.200 --> 34:31.464
desecrate important
archaeological sites

34:31.500 --> 34:34.139
for their own profit.

34:34.170 --> 34:36.559
Sabotaging their ships was
the only way to slow them down.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.363
Until Travis Unger
came along.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.560
VVho?
BELL:
TraVIs Unger.

34:40.610 --> 34:43.101
He used to work for the Public
Administrator's Office.

34:43.140 --> 34:45.472
A couple of months ago,
he got his hands on a logbook

34:45.510 --> 34:48.877
that contained the location
of a sunken treasure galleon.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.809
And he approached Vestergaard
about salvaging the wreck.

34:51.850 --> 34:54.387
Vestergaard turned him away
because he'd filed a claim

34:54.420 --> 34:55.648
on the same ship
over a year ago.

34:55.690 --> 34:57.749
You have the gear
and the know-how

34:57.790 --> 34:59.451
to run the same
kind of operation.

34:59.490 --> 35:01.754
So we think that
Unger came to you next

35:01.800 --> 35:03.529
to try to strike
some kind of a deal.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.358
You realized if you got to
the treasure before Vestergaard,

35:06.400 --> 35:09.460
you'd be able to preserve
it and hurt his business.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.639
Problem was, you couldn't
beat him to the wreck.

35:11.670 --> 35:14.776
And you couldn't promise Unger
the 50% split that he demanded.

35:14.810 --> 35:17.631
Academia is loathe to
authorize such expenditure

35:17.680 --> 35:19.602
without tedious review.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.141
So you killed Unger
and took the book.

35:22.180 --> 35:24.148
What?
And then you
arranged for it

35:24.190 --> 35:26.511
to fall into the hands
of Farhan Al-Asmari.

35:26.550 --> 35:29.257
He keeps his hauls intact
in his own private museum,

35:29.290 --> 35:31.656
and according
to your own academic papers,

35:31.690 --> 35:33.157
he's given you access
to his collection before.

35:33.190 --> 35:34.396
Hold on.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.394
Do I know Mr. Al-Asmari? Yes.

35:38.430 --> 35:41.399
Did I take things
with my students too far?

35:41.440 --> 35:43.294
No question.

35:43.340 --> 35:45.808
But I'm telling you,
none of us killed anyone.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.501
Professor...

35:47.540 --> 35:50.179
No. I have a question now.

35:50.210 --> 35:51.700
What is the name
of this sunken ship

35:51.750 --> 35:54.514
that I supposedly killed over?

35:54.550 --> 35:55.949
The Santa Leticia.

35:55.980 --> 35:59.438
Well, I don't know where
you're getting your facts,

35:59.490 --> 36:02.948
but there wasn't any treasure
on the Santa Leticia.

36:02.990 --> 36:03.809
There was.

36:03.860 --> 36:06.249
Mr. Al-Asmari pulled
up millions in gold.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.895
He's pretty proud
of it, too.

36:11.730 --> 36:14.631
No, this is impossible.

36:14.670 --> 36:16.433
I've read everything
that's ever been written

36:16.470 --> 36:19.268
about the Santa Leticia,
including the records

36:19.310 --> 36:20.902
in the Archives of the Indies
in Seville,

36:20.940 --> 36:24.239
and there is not a document
in recorded history

36:24.280 --> 36:26.646
that says it went down
with gold on it.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.716
Black Peter would disagree
with you.

36:28.750 --> 36:31.742
Black Peter?

36:33.320 --> 36:36.209
The logbook you think I stole,
it was his?

36:37.490 --> 36:40.926
You said Lars filed a claim
on the Santa Leticia

36:40.960 --> 36:43.428
before the logbook surfaced.

36:43.460 --> 36:44.666
Yeah, we verified it.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.895
Hmm, that doesn't
make any sense.

36:46.930 --> 36:49.364
He would've seen all the records
I saw in Spain.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.731
Maybe he just had a hunch.

36:50.770 --> 36:52.931
No, salvagers like him,

36:52.970 --> 36:55.438
they don't work off hunches.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.402
They need to know
there's gold

36:57.440 --> 36:59.249
on a ship like
the Santa Leticia

36:59.280 --> 37:01.714
or they'll have
their investors to answer to.

37:03.920 --> 37:07.014
I've got to make
a call. Excuse me.

37:07.050 --> 37:09.587
Yes, thank you.

37:09.620 --> 37:11.588
So, we're not liking
the professor

37:11.630 --> 37:13.757
for Travis Unger's murder.
Are you?

37:13.790 --> 37:15.826
Everything she said
fairly reeked of the truth.

37:15.860 --> 37:16.895
Is that why you left
to make a call?

37:16.930 --> 37:18.761
HOLMES: I believe she was
also telling the truth

37:18.800 --> 37:20.825
when she said Lars Vestergaard
had to have expected

37:20.870 --> 37:22.838
to find nothing
when he mounted his expedition

37:22.870 --> 37:24.030
to the Santa Leticia.

37:24.070 --> 37:25.901
But that doesn't
make any sense.

37:25.940 --> 37:28.374
Why go to the bottom
of the ocean for nothing?

37:28.410 --> 37:29.968
'Cause I think
in Vestergaard's case,

37:30.010 --> 37:32.672
nothing would have been far more
valuable to him than gold.

37:38.820 --> 37:40.913
Under the right circumstances,
a producer could make more money

37:40.950 --> 37:43.612
with a flop than he could
with a hit.

37:43.660 --> 37:45.582
He's quite good, isn't he?

37:45.630 --> 37:48.952
I'm more of a Chocolate Factory
kind of guy.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.321
Someone want to tell me _
why you're showmg me a mowe?

37:51.370 --> 37:53.497
Because you pulled off
the same kind of scheme,

37:53.530 --> 37:57.034
only instead of a
musical about Nazis,

37:57.070 --> 37:59.504
you convinced your investors
to pay for an expedition

37:59.540 --> 38:01.474
to a ship that
you thought was empty.

38:01.510 --> 38:02.704
(laughing):
Why the hell would I do that?

38:02.740 --> 38:05.800
I asked myself the same question
when a marine archaeologist

38:05.850 --> 38:08.512
insisted that you
couldn't have believed

38:08.550 --> 38:09.676
there was treasure onboard.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.381
I wondered, maybe
your intention

38:11.420 --> 38:13.547
wasn't to plunder
the Santa Leticia,

38:13.590 --> 38:15.319
but rather your
investors' pockets.

38:15.360 --> 38:16.952
So I contacted one that
you'd worked with before,

38:16.990 --> 38:18.855
Clarence Jarman.

38:18.890 --> 38:20.528
WATSON:
He helped us track down

38:20.560 --> 38:22.391
the people who
actually paid for you

38:22.430 --> 38:23.727
to go to the Santa Leticia.

38:23.760 --> 38:24.795
Turns out there
were a lot of them,

38:24.830 --> 38:26.388
more than anyone knew.

38:26.430 --> 38:27.692
HOLMES: Just like the
characters in the movie,

38:27.730 --> 38:29.960
you oversold your shares

38:30.000 --> 38:31.661
in the Santa Leticia's treasure.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.599
You told us that you typically
sell 50% of your profits

38:34.640 --> 38:36.073
to cover your expenses,

38:36.110 --> 38:38.670
but on this expedition
you secretly sold

38:38.710 --> 38:41.873
1,000% of what you might find,

38:41.920 --> 38:45.549
raking in a total
of $15 million in sales.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.410
_ BELL: Your investors _
Signed contracts that said

38:47.450 --> 38:50.453
if the salvage effort was
a flop, they'd get nothing.

38:50.490 --> 38:51.821
That meant that
after the real costs

38:51.860 --> 38:54.021
of the expedition
were covered,

38:54.060 --> 38:56.756
you'd pocket almost
$14 million in profit

38:56.800 --> 38:58.597
and no one_ would
be the Wiser.

38:58.630 --> 38:59.961
Seemed pretty foolproof,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.468
but then a few weeks
before you set sail,

39:02.500 --> 39:05.435
Travis Unger showed up
with Black Peter's logbook.

39:05.470 --> 39:07.631
Suddenly there was evidence
there really was gold

39:07.670 --> 39:09.479
aboard the Santa Leticia.

39:09.510 --> 39:10.534
WATSON:
If you got to the ship

39:10.580 --> 39:12.400
and the treasure
was still there,

39:12.450 --> 39:15.476
you would've owed your investors
ten times whatever it was worth.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.579
Find ten million in gold,
for example,

39:17.620 --> 39:20.043
and you would've had
to give them a hundred million.

39:20.090 --> 39:22.650
BELL:
You couldn't do that.

39:22.690 --> 39:24.157
So you followed Unger
to his storage unit,

39:24.190 --> 39:26.681
killed him and took the logbook.
Now, you still needed

39:26.730 --> 39:28.698
to make the_Santa Leticia's
gold disappear,

39:28.730 --> 39:30.698
so you made sure the book
ended up in the hands

39:30.730 --> 39:32.561
of Farhan Al-Asmari.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.966
He got to the treasure
before you. Problem was solved.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.639
All right.

39:37.670 --> 39:40.764
I may have
oversold some shares,

39:40.810 --> 39:42.539
but I didn't kill anyone.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.070
Perhaps you'll recognize this.

39:44.110 --> 39:47.602
This is a still taken
from a documentary film

39:47.650 --> 39:50.949
that you commissioned during one
of your earliest treasure hunts.

39:50.980 --> 39:54.711
The weapon is a Spanish sword
called a navaja.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.512
You recovered it from a
shipwreck in the Caribbean.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.959
It's different
from a traditional sword

39:57.990 --> 40:00.823
in that the blade folds,
making it easy to conceal.

40:00.860 --> 40:03.988
So?
BELL: So Travis Unger
was killed with a sword.

40:04.030 --> 40:05.691
We'd like you to produce yours

40:05.730 --> 40:07.823
so we can compare it
to the victim's wounds.

40:07.870 --> 40:09.929
I'm sorry.

40:09.970 --> 40:11.528
I've lost it.

40:12.670 --> 40:15.833
Actually, we think you did
quite deliberately.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.804
Coast Guard says that according
to the transponder on your boat,

40:18.850 --> 40:20.579
you took her out
the night of the murder.

40:20.610 --> 40:23.670
You went a half mile outside the
harbor, then came right back.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.187
Now, you're the sunken
treasure expert,

40:25.220 --> 40:26.915
Mr. Vestergaard.

40:26.950 --> 40:28.611
What do you think
our divers will find

40:28.660 --> 40:29.957
when they go to that spot?

40:34.090 --> 40:36.058
Watson, I just left my meeting.

40:36.100 --> 40:39.092
I'm absolutely famished,
so, um, if you'd like me

40:39.130 --> 40:40.666
to bring home
any food for you...

40:43.600 --> 40:45.465
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

40:54.780 --> 40:56.179
You the one taught me
how to coax a confession

40:56.220 --> 40:58.939
out of a suspect. Hmm?

40:58.990 --> 41:00.116
(grunts)

41:00.150 --> 41:04.086
Isolate. Surprise.
Build a rapport.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.951
You didn't thinkI knew
what you were doing?
Shinwell...

41:05.990 --> 41:08.925
(grunts)
No, you gonna
listen to me now.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.099
You want to know
who killed Jameel?

41:11.130 --> 41:14.099
Huh? SBK killed Jameel.

41:14.130 --> 41:16.837
Leadership cut a deal
with a rival gang,

41:16.870 --> 41:19.998
and in exchange
for a cease-fire,

41:20.040 --> 41:21.678
the gangs agreed
to work together

41:21.710 --> 41:23.530
to raise the price of the drugs
they were pushing.

41:23.580 --> 41:26.105
Jameel's death was a condition.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.845
He had taken up
with the ex-girlfriend

41:27.880 --> 41:29.575
of one of the other
gang's lieutenants.

41:29.620 --> 41:30.848
So he had to go.

41:30.880 --> 41:35.112
(grunts, coughs)

41:35.160 --> 41:38.857
SBK asked a friend to do it...
but they lied.

41:38.890 --> 41:40.255
They told his friend
that he was a traitor.

41:40.290 --> 41:41.848
They tricked him.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.822
You looking for someone
who killed one person.

41:43.860 --> 41:46.727
SBK kills dozens
of people a year.

41:46.770 --> 41:48.738
Their drugs ruin
thousands of lives,

41:48.770 --> 41:50.135
but don't nobody care.

41:50.170 --> 41:51.728
They don't get press.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.135
They're not clever.
They're not fun.

41:53.170 --> 41:54.137
They're just evil.

41:54.170 --> 41:56.877
Are you done?

41:56.910 --> 41:58.571
No.

41:58.610 --> 42:00.601
There's something you need
to know before I go.

42:02.780 --> 42:05.988
I'm-a take SBK down.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.647
And anybody who get in my way...

42:07.690 --> 42:09.214
(grunts)

42:09.260 --> 42:12.149
...gonna get hurt.
