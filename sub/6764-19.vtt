02:05.258 --> 02:07.123
You sure about all of this?

02:07.727 --> 02:10.217
You haven't even told your parents.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.458
Yeah, I'm sure.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.229
I mean, I'm not
the first person in the world

02:15.401 --> 02:17.562
this has ever happened to,
you know.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.792
Kelly, how did I wind up here?

02:46.966 --> 02:49.400
Wasn't I the one who was supposed
to do things by the book?

02:49.569 --> 02:53.232
The pragmatist,
the person least likely to mess up.

02:53.406 --> 02:56.375
You're human, Andrea,
just like everybody else.

02:56.543 --> 03:00.309
But you'll get through this.
I'm with you all the way.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.812
I know you are, thanks.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.978
Andrea?

03:08.888 --> 03:10.549
Andrea.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.656
Do you want me to go in with you?

03:14.561 --> 03:16.688
Yeah, yeah. That would be great.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.135
I see you're a student.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.533
Yes, California University.

03:26.239 --> 03:27.729
You're early enough
into your pregnancy

03:27.907 --> 03:29.898
to consider a variety of options.

03:30.076 --> 03:34.740
I've already considered my options,
over and over again.

03:36.082 --> 03:39.347
Nonetheless, by state law,
you will need to sign this consent form

03:39.519 --> 03:42.249
confirming that you are aware
of all your alternatives.

03:42.422 --> 03:43.582
I know my alternatives.

03:43.756 --> 03:47.852
Adoption, marriage, single parenthood,
I'm not interested.

03:48.027 --> 03:51.053
I know what I want
and I would like to have an abortion

03:51.231 --> 03:52.596
and I'd like to have it today.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.661
That's not possible.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.401
Why? I know the laws.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.062
There's no waiting period
here in California.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.472
I don't need parental consent.
I don't see what the problem is.

04:04.644 --> 04:07.340
The problem is,
and I wish that this weren't so,

04:07.513 --> 04:09.481
but you're not
the only woman in this city

04:09.649 --> 04:11.446
with an unwanted pregnancy.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.276
I'm sorry.

04:13.453 --> 04:15.785
I understand the stress
you're going through.

04:16.522 --> 04:17.954
Does the father know?

04:19.158 --> 04:20.988
He knows I'm pregnant.

04:31.904 --> 04:34.236
- I hate hospitals.
- Yeah, me too.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.102
Then why don't you go home?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.767
The doc said the operation's
gonna take six hours.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.243
You can't sit around here all day.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.075
Actually, I was thinking about pacing.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.183
Brandon, I figured you'd be
in the operating room

04:45.351 --> 04:47.080
watching the surgeon and
giving him pointers.

04:47.253 --> 04:49.847
That's real funny. Why don't you take
that show on the road?

04:50.023 --> 04:51.718
Hey, Nat.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.824
- How you doing, buddy?
- Okay.

04:54.994 --> 04:58.657
They shaved my chest and made it
as smooth as a baby's bottom.

04:58.831 --> 05:01.095
And they gave me
something to make me woozy.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.360
That's good.
I mean, you should relax.

05:03.536 --> 05:06.903
Oh, you be quiet.
I'm talking to my boys.

05:07.073 --> 05:10.008
Listen, you guys,
thanks for everything.

05:10.176 --> 05:15.113
You're the best customers I ever had.
And you're the best pals I ever had.

05:15.281 --> 05:17.545
You're gonna be fine, bro.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.645
Just say a prayer.

05:20.086 --> 05:21.212
We will.

05:21.387 --> 05:22.786
Okay.

05:39.038 --> 05:41.131
David, will you turn that thing off?

05:41.307 --> 05:43.537
I can't believe
he's sleeping through this.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.200
David!

05:45.778 --> 05:47.575
- What? What's going on?
- Get up.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.977
You're supposed to be working
at the Peach Pit, remember?

05:50.149 --> 05:52.049
They can live without me.

05:52.218 --> 05:54.686
No, they can't.
Come on, David, get up.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.015
- What time is it, anyway?
- It's late.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.680
How long have you been sleeping?

05:58.858 --> 06:00.291
Here, put these on.

06:00.460 --> 06:01.825
Will you get his shirt?

06:05.665 --> 06:06.723
What's this?

06:06.899 --> 06:08.161
What?

06:08.334 --> 06:09.358
David.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.069
What is it?

06:13.239 --> 06:14.501
I don't know. Cocaine?

06:14.674 --> 06:15.936
David, you're still doing drugs?

06:16.109 --> 06:18.509
It's not mine, all right?
I was holding it for somebody else.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.441
And for your information,
no, it's not coke.

06:20.613 --> 06:23.309
I don't care what it is.
Now you're a drug addict and a liar.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.883
You know what, you had no business
going through my drawers.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.713
- Why don't you get out of here?
- Right.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.219
Look who has
all the principles all of a sudden.

06:31.257 --> 06:32.690
David, I'm sorry.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.421
Donna, what are you
apologizing to him for?

06:35.595 --> 06:38.029
- Shut up, Kelly.
- No, I'm not going to.

06:38.197 --> 06:39.323
I've been through this.

06:39.499 --> 06:42.696
If this is how you're gonna live your life,
then I'm moving out. We're moving out.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.894
- Kelly.
- Fine. Move out.

06:45.071 --> 06:48.837
I'm sick of living here with you two
high priestesses of sobriety, anyway.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.532
Oh, God, here we go again.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.007
No, just start packing.

06:52.178 --> 06:55.204
- But, Kelly...
- Donna, we are getting out of here.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.785
Sorry, are you okay?
I was on my way to class.

07:06.959 --> 07:08.927
Yeah, I was hoping
that we could talk.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.620
Yeah, yeah, sure. Come on in.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.697
What's wrong?

07:20.139 --> 07:23.939
Nothing. Just,
I'm pregnant, remember?

07:24.110 --> 07:26.078
Hey.

07:26.245 --> 07:29.408
Don't worry, we've got nine months
to figure everything out.

07:29.982 --> 07:34.112
No, we don't.
I've decided to have the abortion.

07:34.687 --> 07:35.847
Wait.

07:36.022 --> 07:37.956
What, you decided this
without telling me?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.284
It's my decision to make.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.292
Well, it's my decision too.
That baby is a part of you and me.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.527
We talked about this all last week.

07:44.697 --> 07:45.925
No, you talked about it.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.658
No, we decided.

07:49.569 --> 07:51.867
I'm gonna take the clerkship
in San Francisco this summer.

07:52.038 --> 07:54.165
You'll come with me,
we'll get married, have the baby,

07:54.340 --> 07:55.932
then move back here
and finish school.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.201
- You've worked it all out, haven't you?
- You agreed.

07:58.377 --> 08:00.572
Well, I'm sorry,
I've changed my mind.

08:02.114 --> 08:03.911
Jesse, I'm not even 20 years old.

08:04.083 --> 08:08.452
I can't do this. You can't do this.
It would ruin our lives.

08:08.788 --> 08:11.586
It was just a mistake, okay?
It was a terrible mistake.

08:11.757 --> 08:14.658
It's not a mistake, it's a baby.

08:15.127 --> 08:17.755
And we may not have planned it,
but it's not a mistake.

08:18.197 --> 08:20.427
I'm sorry, I don't feel that way.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.070
Andrea,

08:26.839 --> 08:29.933
if you go through with this abortion,
don't come back here.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.438
I was afraid you'd say that, and...

08:35.414 --> 08:38.280
...if that's what you want,
I understand.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.096
<i>- Hi, it's Dylan, I'm not here right now.
- It's his machine.</i>

08:53.266 --> 08:55.564
<i>- Leave a number, I'll call you back.
- Dylan, hi, it's me.</i>

08:55.735 --> 08:58.431
Look, do me a favor
and leave a key under the mat.

08:58.604 --> 09:01.630
I may have to stay at your
house tonight. For a while, actually.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.468
I hope that's okay.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.611
Love you. Bye.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.245
Oh, great.
You get to stay with Dylan,

09:07.413 --> 09:10.610
I have to stay at one of the most
crowded sorority houses on campus?

09:10.783 --> 09:14.446
Donna, it's not forever.
You'll survive.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.885
Kelly, I just don't understand how
deserting David is gonna help him.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.457
We're not deserting him.
You gotta get that through your head.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.594
- Tough love.
- Right, and it works.

09:22.762 --> 09:24.457
Believe me,
I have first-hand experience.

09:24.630 --> 09:27.155
Yeah, but your mother went
into a hospital, into a program.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.234
We're leaving David by himself
and it could get worse.

09:30.403 --> 09:34.362
Donna, we have been there
to catch David all semester long.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.667
We've been waking him up,
reminding him to study,

09:36.842 --> 09:38.901
picking up his clothes,
buying his food.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.238
I'm sick of it.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.108
Believe me,
he's not gonna clean up his act

09:42.281 --> 09:44.374
until he thinks
he's got something to lose.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.311
Well, what about the rent?
It's due in a couple days.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.748
That's David's responsibility now.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.414
That's not fair.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.426
Yeah, and bringing drugs
into the house is fair?

09:57.296 --> 09:59.696
Come on, we have to get to class.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.568
Well, I'd get started,
but according to my roster here,

10:07.740 --> 10:10.106
I'm still waiting
for a few more students.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.172
Yeah, a couple of
my friends are coming.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.246
You made quite an impression on us
at Take Back the Night Week.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.879
Good, I'm glad.
And what's your name?

10:18.050 --> 10:19.540
Brenda. Brenda Walsh.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.482
I think you know
my brother Brandon.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.088
He was in your husband's
sociology class.

10:24.256 --> 10:25.450
My ex-husband.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.459
I didn't realize.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.994
A recent development.

10:30.863 --> 10:31.955
Sorry we're late.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.099
We were just getting started.

10:34.533 --> 10:35.557
- Okay.
- Hi.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.032
- Hi.
- I'm Lucinda Nicholson.

10:37.203 --> 10:40.798
And this seminar is called Feminist
Perspectives in Cultural Anthropology.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.741
Is Andrea coming?

10:43.909 --> 10:45.809
No, she can't make it.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.070
Is she okay?

10:47.246 --> 10:49.476
Yeah, she's fine.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.224
Brandon.

11:00.860 --> 11:01.884
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:02.061 --> 11:04.655
I stopped by the cafeteria.
I thought you might be hungry.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.320
Thanks.

11:06.532 --> 11:09.330
- Any news yet?
- No, he's still in there.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.369
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Lucinda Nicholson says hello.

11:12.538 --> 11:14.335
Where did you run into Lucinda?

11:14.507 --> 11:17.032
I didn't run into her.
I'm taking her seminar.

11:17.209 --> 11:19.006
Donna, Andrea and Kelly
are in it too.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.202
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.370
What exactly
is she teaching all of you?

11:22.548 --> 11:25.278
Power feminism,
an anthropological perspective.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.284
Well, yeah, that sounds
radical enough for her.

11:28.454 --> 11:30.820
Did you know she split up
with Professor Randall?

11:30.990 --> 11:32.457
They split up?

11:32.625 --> 11:35.594
Yeah, they're getting a divorce.
It sounds pretty brutal.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.559
Wait a minute, if you just met her,
how come she told you all this?

11:38.731 --> 11:41.495
Well, it's a small seminar
on feminist politics.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.134
I mean, it gets pretty personal.

11:43.302 --> 11:46.032
Actually, she's
a pretty fascinating woman.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.536
Yeah, you can say that again.

11:51.877 --> 11:55.506
You know, Silver is not stupid.
I don't know what he's thinking.

11:55.681 --> 11:57.012
I don't know either.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.083
I thought for sure
when he lost Erin,

11:59.251 --> 12:00.912
it would've shaken him up
enough to quit.

12:01.087 --> 12:02.418
But here we are, two weeks later,

12:02.588 --> 12:04.886
waiting for him to find
another low in his life.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.924
Well, I'll tell you what, we can
unpack the rest of that stuff tomorrow.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.891
But I am beat.

12:10.062 --> 12:14.431
I've been driving back and forth
from the hospital to the Pit all day.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.068
I'm sorry to dump all this on you.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.362
It's all right.

12:19.171 --> 12:21.002
You can stay as long as you like.

12:21.173 --> 12:22.606
Thanks.

12:23.342 --> 12:24.434
You know, when I was little,

12:24.610 --> 12:26.908
I remember whenever
I'd stay home from school sick,

12:27.079 --> 12:30.879
and the housekeeper would make me
tomato soup with cream

12:31.050 --> 12:33.917
and she would let me
watch TV all day.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.145
<i>Reruns of Bewitched
were my favorite.</i>

12:36.322 --> 12:38.722
- Yeah.
- I'd pretend I was Samantha,

12:38.891 --> 12:39.949
and I would wiggle my nose

12:40.126 --> 12:42.686
and everybody's problems
would just disappear.

12:43.195 --> 12:45.595
Wiggle your nose for me.

12:46.565 --> 12:48.624
It's a sweet nose. It's a cute nose.

12:48.801 --> 12:51.702
I don't think it has
any magical powers, though.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.342
Yeah.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.382
- Donna.
- Hi.

13:05.551 --> 13:08.019
I'm sorry to barge in like this.

13:08.187 --> 13:09.518
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

13:09.688 --> 13:12.418
I thought I could stay at the Alpha
House, but they didn't have room.

13:12.591 --> 13:16.220
Donna, luckily for you, there happens
to be a vacancy at the Hotel McKay.

13:16.395 --> 13:18.260
- Thanks, Dylan.
- Yeah.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.921
You know, I could just
go back to the apartment.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.499
No, Donna, you stay here.

13:22.668 --> 13:23.999
Maybe David was telling the truth.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.365
Maybe he was just
holding the stuff for his friend.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.242
Oh, come on, Don.
You don't really believe that, do you?

13:30.676 --> 13:33.975
I don't know.
What's wrong with him?

13:34.413 --> 13:36.313
Sounds to me like
he's got a drug problem.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.180
How can you say that?
He just started doing this.

13:39.351 --> 13:42.946
Donna, he did not just start doing this.
He's been doing it for over a month.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.750
You and I both know that
he doesn't have any plans to stop.

13:47.259 --> 13:48.487
I love him.

13:48.861 --> 13:51.022
Of course you love him.
We all love him, Don.

13:51.197 --> 13:55.133
But reality's reality.
David's a drug addict.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.546
Howard, my man. What's shaking?

14:09.081 --> 14:10.514
Aren't you a little early, Silver?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.344
Yeah, my roommates
were getting on my case.

14:12.518 --> 14:16.147
So I thought I'd just hang out here,
maybe get a little taste of something.

14:16.655 --> 14:18.452
A little taste of something?

14:18.624 --> 14:19.784
Oh, come on, man, I'm fine.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.359
It just helps me through
that dungeon of a shift you gave me.

14:22.528 --> 14:26.828
You know, David,
I thought you had a drug problem.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.864
Now I realize
you don't have a drug problem.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.899
You just have
a problem getting drugs.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.172
You're toasted right now, aren't you?

14:38.410 --> 14:39.934
Yeah, well, I got a little buzz going.

14:40.112 --> 14:42.512
David, pick up whatever stuff
you have left in the booth

14:42.681 --> 14:43.705
and clean out your locker.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.851
You're finished here.

14:46.018 --> 14:47.986
- You're firing me?
- That's right.

14:48.153 --> 14:50.417
For doing what everybody else
around here is doing?

14:50.589 --> 14:52.682
- You're such a hypocrite.
- Okay.

14:52.858 --> 14:54.325
I use the stuff sometimes too.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.290
So what? I'm not perfect.

14:56.462 --> 14:59.192
But look at you, man. You're hooked.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.691
You're no good to anyone.

15:02.601 --> 15:05.297
All right, fine, whatever.
This place sucks anyway.

15:05.471 --> 15:07.200
You know what,
you're never gonna find anyone

15:07.373 --> 15:09.034
as talented as I am
to stay up all night.

15:09.208 --> 15:12.041
Well, I'm just gonna have
to take my chances on that.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.362
I warned you about burning the candle
at both ends and you wouldn't listen.

15:35.534 --> 15:36.694
Now look at you.

15:36.869 --> 15:40.032
Jim, I don't think he can hear you.

15:40.205 --> 15:42.400
Talk to us, Brandon, please.

15:43.642 --> 15:46.543
I'm sorry, folks.
Visiting hours are over.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.312
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.449
We'll be back tomorrow, sweetheart.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.517
We love you, son.

16:02.828 --> 16:04.386
Wake up, Brandon.

16:04.763 --> 16:07.095
It's time for your massage.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.768
I thought they'd never leave.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.274
You seem a lot stronger today.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.603
It must be your treatments.

16:20.612 --> 16:23.342
You know, I always knew
you were a healer.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.282
And I'm here to heal you.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.292
Oh, Brandon...

16:34.994 --> 16:38.157
Brandon. Yo, Brandon.

16:38.797 --> 16:40.389
Brandon.

16:40.566 --> 16:44.593
Hey. Nat made it through surgery
with no complications.

16:44.770 --> 16:45.828
He's in recovery.

16:47.406 --> 16:48.430
Thank God.

16:48.607 --> 16:50.837
He's got about a million tubes
running in and out of him,

16:51.010 --> 16:54.571
and he sure ain't saying much,
but he's all right.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.045
Now, you, you go on home
and get some sleep.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.047
You look like you could use it.
Go on.

16:59.218 --> 17:00.685
Yeah.

17:01.286 --> 17:03.686
- Thanks, Joey.
- You're welcome.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.127
You're on your own tonight, honey.

17:11.296 --> 17:15.027
My first paper's due tomorrow
and I don't have time to cook dinner.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.462
I'll cook.

17:16.635 --> 17:19.762
I was afraid you'd say that.
There's a lasagna in the freezer.

17:19.938 --> 17:21.030
Just talked to the hospital,

17:21.205 --> 17:23.367
Nat's already sitting up in bed
and pinching the nurses.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.373
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.808
Yeah, maybe life can return
to normal around here.

17:28.247 --> 17:30.374
I think this is the first morning

17:30.549 --> 17:32.380
since Nat got sick
we've seen you at breakfast.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.076
Yeah, Suzanne opened up today
so I could sleep in

17:35.254 --> 17:37.586
and make it to my
task-force meeting this morning.

17:37.756 --> 17:40.554
I don't believe it. You mean
you're actually going to school today?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.193
This is a red-letter day.

17:42.361 --> 17:45.853
Well, just so you know, Dad, I will be
going back to the Pit this afternoon.

17:46.031 --> 17:49.330
I'm sure you will.
How can it function without you?

17:50.102 --> 17:52.935
You know, I really
don't appreciate that.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.104
I made a commitment here, Dad,

17:55.274 --> 17:57.799
and I'm gonna stick this out
until Nat gets back on his feet.

17:57.976 --> 18:00.809
Brandon, what if
that never happens?

18:01.246 --> 18:02.770
Have you considered that?

18:02.948 --> 18:04.279
Of course I have.

18:04.450 --> 18:06.281
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

18:07.286 --> 18:09.982
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Bye, honey.

18:18.063 --> 18:19.155
Can I have some more coffee?

18:19.331 --> 18:20.491
Me too.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.395
Hey, take it easy.

18:22.568 --> 18:24.433
The two of you are gonna
eat up all the profits.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.627
Profits?

18:26.472 --> 18:29.669
Come on.
This place doesn't make any profits.

18:30.075 --> 18:31.372
Well, tell me, Joey.

18:31.543 --> 18:34.740
If your cousin isn't making any money,
why does he stay in business?

18:35.514 --> 18:37.141
What can I tell you?

18:37.316 --> 18:39.375
He's a sentimental nut, okay?

18:39.551 --> 18:43.817
And I'm even crazier
because I own 50 percent of this joint.

18:45.190 --> 18:48.717
So how many of your friends
you got coming in to work today?

18:48.894 --> 18:50.486
Well, Brenda and Kelly
will be here later.

18:50.662 --> 18:52.027
And I know Brandon will be here.

18:52.197 --> 18:54.529
Brandon. That kid
is busting his hump.

18:54.700 --> 18:58.966
Listen, Dylan, maybe I shouldn't be
sticking my nose in here,

18:59.138 --> 19:01.265
but you guys can't run the Pit,
not between classes

19:01.440 --> 19:02.907
and sorority meetings and dates.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.099
This is a business.

19:04.276 --> 19:06.005
She's right.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.371
Look, I know you kids mean well.

19:08.814 --> 19:09.838
And like Brandon says,

19:10.015 --> 19:12.108
I'm sure it helped Nat
make it through the surgery,

19:12.284 --> 19:14.343
knowing the Pit would be here
when he woke up,

19:14.520 --> 19:20.390
but even after he recovers,
this place is in critical condition.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.561
Nothing a little money wouldn't fix.

19:23.729 --> 19:27.290
All I know is I've had my cash
in this place for two years now,

19:27.466 --> 19:29.627
and I've never seen a dime.

19:29.801 --> 19:32.702
No, it's time for this paisan to bail.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.271
So, what are you saying?
You thinking of selling out?

19:35.440 --> 19:39.376
Yeah, but you gotta have a buyer
before you can sell, you know?

19:48.921 --> 19:50.320
Brandon.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.889
Hey, Dean Trimble.
I was just on my way to the meeting.

19:53.058 --> 19:55.322
Then we can walk together,
give us a chance to talk.

19:55.494 --> 19:56.518
Great.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.560
The task force hasn't been
the same without you.

19:58.730 --> 20:01.028
Yeah, I'm sorry, a good friend of mine
was in the hospital.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.258
I know, I got your message,

20:02.434 --> 20:05.369
and I hope everything's okay, because
if you can't fulfill the commitment...

20:05.537 --> 20:07.266
No, no, I'll be at
every meeting from now on.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.430
It was just... It was a tough week.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.771
Oh, good.
Because you've got good ideas,

20:12.945 --> 20:14.469
and some really
good energy, Brandon.

20:14.646 --> 20:17.581
And frankly,
when you're not in the mix,

20:17.749 --> 20:18.773
we miss you.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.213
Well, thanks.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.546
Ms. Nicholson, good morning.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.120
Hello, dean. How are you?

20:24.523 --> 20:26.582
Fine. Have you met Brandon Walsh?

20:26.758 --> 20:29.420
He's one of our students
on the Educational Task Force.

20:29.595 --> 20:30.994
Lucinda Nicholson.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.227
Brandon Walsh. Nice to meet you.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.930
You too.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.034
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for class.

20:37.202 --> 20:38.760
Absolutely.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.606
A very promising
young anthropologist.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.308
You should talk with her
sometime, Brandon.

20:46.478 --> 20:51.108
She's got some very firm ideas
on the position of women in academia.

20:51.283 --> 20:53.979
Yeah, I'll remember that.

20:56.521 --> 20:59.081
Good morning.
How's everybody doing?

21:00.359 --> 21:03.487
Okay. Let's get started right away.

21:04.162 --> 21:07.928
Most stories about the American West
were written by men

21:08.100 --> 21:10.125
and tell men's stories.

21:10.302 --> 21:14.739
John Muir, Buffalo Bill,
even Wyatt Earp.

21:16.375 --> 21:19.310
This is how
women told their stories.

21:19.478 --> 21:20.536
On quilts?

21:20.712 --> 21:22.304
Why didn't they just
write it in diaries?

21:22.481 --> 21:23.914
That was considered
a waste of time.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.643
This way, they could tell a story
and keep warm at the same time.

21:29.888 --> 21:31.412
Have any of you
ever worked on a quilt?

21:31.590 --> 21:33.922
My grandmother used to make
the most incredible quilts.

21:34.092 --> 21:37.789
She was trying to teach me, but I...

21:38.764 --> 21:40.356
Andrea, you all right?

21:41.633 --> 21:43.294
No.

21:50.575 --> 21:52.008
Was it something I said?

21:53.145 --> 21:56.842
Andrea? Andrea?

21:57.616 --> 21:59.140
Are you okay?

21:59.318 --> 22:02.412
Whoever said pregnancy
was a blessed event

22:02.587 --> 22:04.680
never had morning sickness.

22:04.856 --> 22:08.587
Eat soda crackers.
Jackie swore by them with Erin.

22:09.528 --> 22:11.894
This will be over soon enough.

22:14.466 --> 22:16.730
Let me get you a towel.

22:16.902 --> 22:18.961
Yeah. Thanks.

22:26.078 --> 22:28.103
Well, all the year-end
summaries are in.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.545
So the sooner we wrap this up,
the sooner we can file.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.950
Yeah, how about Tuesday,
9 a. m., that's fine.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.951
All right, I'll see you then.

22:37.122 --> 22:39.920
Well, Mr. McKay, you actually
made an appointment this time.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.060
What's the occasion?

22:42.227 --> 22:44.252
I wanna buy the Peach Pit.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.095
You what?

22:46.732 --> 22:47.790
Not all of it, actually.

22:47.966 --> 22:49.331
I talked to Nat's cousin Joey,

22:49.501 --> 22:52.527
he said he'd sell me
his half for 75,000.

22:53.071 --> 22:54.538
He did?

22:55.574 --> 22:56.598
And you wanna buy it?

22:56.775 --> 22:58.208
That's what I just said.

22:58.744 --> 23:01.212
Why on earth would you
wanna do something like that?

23:01.380 --> 23:03.314
I like the food.

23:03.648 --> 23:05.673
That's not a good reason
to buy a restaurant.

23:06.752 --> 23:09.653
Look, Jim, I figure the Peach Pit needs
some cash, some good management.

23:09.821 --> 23:11.812
Between me and Suzanne,
we got both ends covered.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.014
Suzanne?

23:13.191 --> 23:14.488
She's got a lot of experience.

23:14.659 --> 23:15.887
She's a waitress, Dylan.

23:16.495 --> 23:19.589
Look, I've been handling Nat's books
for about two years now.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.128
That restaurant
has never made a dime.

23:22.601 --> 23:24.398
Ever lost one?

23:25.570 --> 23:28.004
No. But things are different.

23:28.173 --> 23:30.573
Nat's in the hospital.
Things are up in the air.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.835
I just wanna help it
get back down to earth.

23:33.412 --> 23:37.178
Look, I have to advise you,
this is a terrible investment.

23:37.349 --> 23:39.374
You don't know anything
about running a restaurant,

23:39.551 --> 23:41.075
you'll lose your shirt.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.221
So what? I got a lot of shirts.

23:43.622 --> 23:44.816
I got a closet full of shirts,

23:44.990 --> 23:48.084
no one should know that better
than you. I can afford another shirt.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.625
Dylan, that's not the point.

23:49.795 --> 23:52.093
Exactly what am I worth now?

23:52.664 --> 23:56.065
- What is with you kids and this diner?
- Like I said, we like the food.

23:56.234 --> 23:58.998
And this way, Brandon doesn't have
to save the world all by himself.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.731
I can't talk you out of this, can I?

24:03.508 --> 24:05.169
No. So you'll handle it, right?

24:05.343 --> 24:09.279
I don't have to threaten
to fire you again, do I?

24:21.760 --> 24:24.456
Andy, it's me, David Silver.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.469
Looks like I'm right on time.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.108
You're getting to be one of
my best customers, Silver.

24:38.844 --> 24:40.903
Listen, could you do me a gram?

24:42.214 --> 24:46.048
I can handle the weight
if you got the loot.

24:47.586 --> 24:51.283
Yeah, well, listen, I was wondering
if today I could write you a check for it.

24:51.456 --> 24:52.889
Check?

24:53.058 --> 24:55.959
You know, it's like the sign
at my old man's store says:

24:56.127 --> 24:59.426
"I trust in God,
everyone else pays cash. "

24:59.598 --> 25:01.532
Yeah, I understand.

25:03.568 --> 25:05.468
Well, how about fronting me?
I'm good for it.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.968
You're a good customer, but you know
something, you're also a new one.

25:09.140 --> 25:10.971
Come back when
you can pay the freight.

25:11.743 --> 25:13.643
Door's that way.

25:13.812 --> 25:17.304
- I'll be back.
- Yeah, I'm sure you will.

25:27.626 --> 25:29.890
His vital signs are stable.

25:30.061 --> 25:33.155
Okay, 60 milligrams IM?

25:33.331 --> 25:35.458
P.r. n., okay.

25:36.935 --> 25:39.563
I didn't expect to see
a party going on in here.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.933
- You're looking good, Nat.
- Thanks, Brando.

25:42.107 --> 25:43.369
Flowers.

25:43.875 --> 25:47.902
I'm sorry, flowers aren't allowed
in the coronary care unit.

25:48.079 --> 25:49.239
Oh, sure.

25:49.414 --> 25:52.349
- But thanks for the thought anyway.
- That's okay.

25:52.517 --> 25:53.950
Nat doesn't need
any flowers anyway.

25:54.119 --> 25:55.984
He's got great news instead.

25:56.154 --> 25:58.816
- What's up?
- Hey, Dylan, you tell him.

25:58.990 --> 26:00.821
Come on, you're the
hero of the day, pal.

26:00.992 --> 26:02.152
Not right now, Joey.

26:02.327 --> 26:04.227
Come on, will you
tell him the good news?

26:05.163 --> 26:06.755
Somebody better tell me.

26:11.169 --> 26:12.636
I bought out Joey.

26:13.104 --> 26:15.698
So Nat and I are partners in the Pit.

26:15.874 --> 26:17.307
Good news, huh?

26:17.475 --> 26:19.136
Never in a million years
would I ever guess

26:19.311 --> 26:21.541
that a kid that grew up
eating in my joint

26:21.713 --> 26:23.908
would wind up being my partner.

26:25.483 --> 26:28.213
Yeah, that's great, guys.
That's really great.

26:28.386 --> 26:31.184
It just went down this afternoon,
or I would've told you sooner.

26:31.790 --> 26:35.556
Sure, no. Listen, hey,
congratulations to both of you.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.786
I think that's great. Really.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.570
Cheers. Watch, watch.

26:50.742 --> 26:51.970
Dylan, this is so cool.

26:52.143 --> 26:54.577
I cannot believe you're
a part owner of the Peach Pit.

26:54.746 --> 26:57.146
Well, for better or for worse,
it's a done deal.

26:57.315 --> 27:00.443
It's definitely for the better.
Congratulations.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.610
Great place, great location.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.084
Great customers, I might add.

27:04.255 --> 27:06.120
Hey, don't think just because
you know the boss,

27:06.291 --> 27:08.122
you're gonna get
any special favors, all right?

27:08.293 --> 27:10.853
Oh, right, if Kelly's craving
a megaburger at 2:30 in the morning,

27:11.029 --> 27:13.020
you're not gonna come down here
and cook it for her?

27:13.198 --> 27:14.927
Well, Steve, this may come
as a shock to you,

27:15.100 --> 27:17.625
but when Kelly's with me,
she doesn't crave anything.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.328
No comment.

27:21.906 --> 27:24.807
I gotta start the inventory tonight.
We're gonna have to start hiring too.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.841
I'll leave the
nuts and bolts of it to you.

27:27.012 --> 27:30.311
Yeah, you and Nat can just sit back
and watch the money roll in.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.450
Much money.

27:33.752 --> 27:36.346
- Hi, David.
- Hi.

27:36.521 --> 27:38.216
Look, I don't mean to
interrupt the party,

27:38.390 --> 27:41.154
but since you're talking about money,
what about your rent?

27:41.326 --> 27:42.554
What about it?

27:43.228 --> 27:45.128
You just plan on
sticking me with your share?

27:45.497 --> 27:48.625
We don't live there anymore.
That's your problem now.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.233
Oh, that's real mature.

27:50.869 --> 27:53.201
What about you, Donna?
You gonna shaft me too?

27:55.173 --> 27:56.504
Yes, she is.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.109
It's for your own good, David.

27:59.644 --> 28:02.807
Excuse me, what's this I hear?
Am I sensing a little hostility?

28:03.381 --> 28:05.679
Yeah, sure, it's for my own good.

28:09.154 --> 28:10.951
Hey, what's up with him?

28:12.290 --> 28:14.224
He's doing drugs.

28:14.392 --> 28:15.620
No way.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.694
Kel, do you have to tell everyone?

28:17.862 --> 28:18.886
Yes, I do.

28:19.064 --> 28:20.929
I've told Mel, I've called Jackie.

28:21.099 --> 28:23.727
Donna, I'm not
covering for him anymore.

28:30.341 --> 28:33.401
- David, David, hold up.
- Now what?

28:33.578 --> 28:35.409
Please, look, I didn't
come after you to fight.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.810
I just... I wanna
give you the rent money.

28:37.982 --> 28:39.916
Yeah, well, does Kelly
know you're out here?

28:40.085 --> 28:42.144
Look, forget about Kelly.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.754
It's not fair we'd leave you
on the hook like this.

28:44.923 --> 28:47.391
Yeah, well, I'm still up a creek
without her share of the rent.

28:47.559 --> 28:48.583
I know that.

28:48.760 --> 28:52.457
That's why I'm gonna give you
enough to cover both shares, okay?

28:52.630 --> 28:54.188
Should I make it out to Mr. Pitts?

28:54.365 --> 28:55.764
No, just make it out to me.

28:55.934 --> 28:59.097
That way I can add it to my share
and just give him one big check for it.

28:59.270 --> 29:00.897
Okay.

29:01.539 --> 29:04.007
Thanks. You're the best.

29:05.176 --> 29:07.804
Just promise me you'll
go see your therapist again.

29:07.979 --> 29:09.207
Tell me you'll get help.

29:10.248 --> 29:13.081
I will, I promise. Scout's honor.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.083
I just want you to get better.

29:16.254 --> 29:17.619
I know you do.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.788
And this will make a big difference.

29:35.073 --> 29:36.904
What's this?
You're actually cracking a book?

29:37.509 --> 29:41.104
Well, now that Dylan bought the Pit,
I got a little time on my hands.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.042
I still can't believe he did it.

29:43.214 --> 29:45.307
He had to put
his money somewhere.

29:45.483 --> 29:47.383
It's weird, though, don't you think?

29:47.552 --> 29:49.076
If Dylan hadn't
stepped up to the plate,

29:49.254 --> 29:51.051
the Peach Pit probably
would've closed down.

29:51.489 --> 29:53.389
But what about you, Brandon?

29:53.558 --> 29:55.287
I mean, don't you feel
kind of left out?

29:58.129 --> 29:59.596
Brandon, come on. Spill it.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.701
You know what I feel like?

30:03.868 --> 30:07.201
I feel like I'm in a big game,

30:07.372 --> 30:09.932
and I'm running for the end zone
and the crowd is cheering

30:10.108 --> 30:12.633
and all of a sudden,
this guy comes out of nowhere,

30:12.811 --> 30:15.405
grabs the ball
and scores the touchdown.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.781
You guys are all on the same team.
We all are.

30:18.950 --> 30:20.850
Yeah, I know, you're right.

30:21.019 --> 30:23.487
I really don't need
a pat on the back here.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.452
We're all doing this for Nat.

30:31.529 --> 30:33.258
Kelly, why do they call it
morning sickness?

30:33.431 --> 30:35.399
I mean, it lasts all day long.

30:36.067 --> 30:37.967
You're probably
just nervous about tomorrow.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.369
Yeah.

30:43.808 --> 30:46.470
Everything will be okay. I promise.

30:47.445 --> 30:48.810
Thanks.

30:50.648 --> 30:53.014
So have you heard from Jesse?

30:56.588 --> 31:00.752
Maybe he just needs a little time.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.427
No, no, I...

31:04.596 --> 31:06.826
I think he meant what he said.

31:06.998 --> 31:09.159
If I have this abortion, we're through.

31:10.268 --> 31:12.429
Are you okay with that?

31:15.773 --> 31:17.934
I guess I have to be, right?

31:20.511 --> 31:23.503
Kelly, I'm so confused.
I feel so guilty.

31:23.681 --> 31:29.051
I mean, I wanna have
a family someday, but not now.

31:29.220 --> 31:33.384
I mean, I'm just a freshman in college.
I can't have a baby.

31:34.759 --> 31:37.193
You have to do what's right for you.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.129
Everything else will be okay.

31:41.299 --> 31:43.028
I hope so.

31:44.502 --> 31:46.026
I'd better get going.

31:46.204 --> 31:48.069
We have a big day
ahead of us tomorrow.

31:48.673 --> 31:50.106
Try to get some sleep.

31:50.275 --> 31:52.175
Okay, I'll try.
See you in the morning.

31:52.343 --> 31:54.607
Okay. Bye.

32:06.724 --> 32:08.282
Searching for a new place to live?

32:08.459 --> 32:09.619
Isn't everybody?

32:09.794 --> 32:10.886
Oh, no, not me.

32:11.062 --> 32:12.757
I have a place
right on the beach, remember?

32:12.931 --> 32:13.955
Got a great view.

32:14.132 --> 32:16.225
Of the inside of a toilet.

32:26.744 --> 32:29.372
- Andy, it's me, David.
- What do you want?

32:29.547 --> 32:32.948
I just got a visit
from the cash fairy. Open up.

32:42.060 --> 32:44.358
What's going on down there, huh?

32:45.363 --> 32:49.390
Okay. Okay, you've made your point.

32:51.202 --> 32:55.298
You know, if you're trying to tell me
something, it's not gonna work.

32:58.276 --> 33:00.506
You heard what I told Kelly.

33:01.646 --> 33:04.706
I'm just not ready
to be a mommy, okay?

33:06.884 --> 33:09.580
It's not that you're unwanted,
it's just...

33:10.655 --> 33:13.123
I don't know what I'm doing.

33:15.326 --> 33:18.762
Wait, why am I even talking to you?
It's not even like you're a baby.

33:23.468 --> 33:25.629
I'm so sorry.

33:27.305 --> 33:30.331
I'm so sorry to do this to you.

33:46.657 --> 33:47.817
Jesse.

33:47.992 --> 33:49.323
Andrea, are you all right?

33:49.894 --> 33:53.455
Yeah, I'm fine. Come on in.

33:58.736 --> 34:00.431
I'm sorry.

34:01.172 --> 34:02.434
I should have been here for you.

34:02.607 --> 34:04.768
I shouldn't have made you
go through it alone.

34:06.010 --> 34:07.978
Please, please, forgive me.

34:08.713 --> 34:12.978
I may never agree with what you did,
but I can't lose you too.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.877
- I'm sorry.
- Look, you don't have to apologize.

34:17.221 --> 34:21.554
Besides, I haven't done anything yet.

34:22.126 --> 34:24.617
- You haven't?
- No.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.362
And I'm not sure I'm going to.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.058
I think that I...

34:31.235 --> 34:33.726
I think I want this baby.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.339
Andrea.

34:43.214 --> 34:47.411
- Are you sure you do?
- Yes, yes, yes.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.497
- Brandon.
- What?

35:05.670 --> 35:08.537
Don't you want some of this lasagna
I spent 20 minutes thawing out?

35:08.706 --> 35:09.832
No, thanks, Dad.

35:10.007 --> 35:11.941
I'll get something
at the Peach Pit later.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.045
I gotta get to the hospital and see Nat
before visiting hours are over.

35:15.213 --> 35:18.205
You know, Brandon,
I know it may not seem like it,

35:18.382 --> 35:22.216
but I'm very proud
of everything you did for Nat.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.080
Yeah, right.

35:24.255 --> 35:27.622
No, you have a big heart, Brandon.
There's nothing wrong with that.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.454
Well, there's really no point
in me busting my butt anymore,

35:30.628 --> 35:33.256
now that Dylan's
taken control of the situation.

35:33.431 --> 35:36.628
What's that old saying, Dad?
Money talks?

35:37.535 --> 35:40.436
In case you think I tried to pull
the rug out from under you, I didn't.

35:40.605 --> 35:43.335
I happen to think it's the worst kind
of investment Dylan can make,

35:43.508 --> 35:45.738
no matter how much money he has.

35:46.210 --> 35:48.735
Dad, tell me something.

35:48.913 --> 35:51.746
You handle other people's
money every day.

35:51.916 --> 35:54.282
More money, probably,
than you'll ever make.

35:54.752 --> 35:56.617
Doesn't that ever get to you?

35:56.787 --> 35:58.015
Sometimes.

35:58.189 --> 36:00.953
You ever wonder what it would
be like to be rich and powerful?

36:01.659 --> 36:03.422
It's not in the cards for me.

36:04.929 --> 36:06.624
You think it will be for me?

36:06.797 --> 36:10.255
I think that you can do
or be anything you want.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.928
Which is why I've always
pushed you so hard in school.

36:13.104 --> 36:15.538
And why I'm making
such a big deal about this task force.

36:16.340 --> 36:19.366
It's your ticket, Brandon.
Power isn't just about money.

36:19.544 --> 36:21.637
I don't know
if I believe that anymore, Dad.

36:22.079 --> 36:23.808
I mean, take a look at Dylan.

36:23.981 --> 36:27.382
No matter how much he screws up,
he'll always have millions.

36:28.553 --> 36:30.487
Doesn't mean
he knows what to do with it.

36:32.924 --> 36:34.016
Thanks, Dad.

36:36.394 --> 36:38.521
Sure you don't want some lasagna?

36:40.898 --> 36:41.922
No.

36:42.099 --> 36:43.430
No, no, I...

36:43.601 --> 36:45.364
I gotta go.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.710
Hey, man, visiting hours are over.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.439
- They just threw me out.
- Oh, jeez.

36:58.616 --> 37:01.176
- Want me to talk to the nurse...?
- No, that's okay.

37:01.352 --> 37:04.048
Just buy your own hospital, then you
can make all the rules you want.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.087
Nobody's trying to rain
on your parade, bro.

37:06.257 --> 37:08.248
Nat's gonna remember
what happened.

37:08.926 --> 37:10.393
I was just kidding.

37:10.861 --> 37:14.388
Yeah, I know that. It's just,
I got all this money, man.

37:14.565 --> 37:17.591
You know? I don't know what to do.
I can't let it sit there drawing interest.

37:17.768 --> 37:20.566
I can't spend it on
Porsches and stuff, and I...

37:20.738 --> 37:23.969
I'm not gonna sit around and worry
about somebody trying to rip me off.

37:24.141 --> 37:26.541
You just don't know what it's like.

37:26.711 --> 37:28.440
You got that right.

37:28.613 --> 37:31.548
Anyway, I just did it because
Nat's a friend of mine, man.

37:31.716 --> 37:35.152
And I wanted to keep something going
that we all think is important.

37:36.220 --> 37:37.812
What are you doing,
taking lessons for me?

37:37.989 --> 37:39.286
Who, me? You kidding?

37:39.457 --> 37:41.186
You hang around with
a Boy Scout long enough,

37:41.359 --> 37:42.826
you're gonna learn the handshake.

37:43.894 --> 37:45.327
Come on, you hungry?

37:45.496 --> 37:47.930
Yeah, a little bit.
I'll buy you a megaburger.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.432
No, thanks, I think
I'll buy my own megaburger.

37:51.602 --> 37:54.799
At cost. Maybe.

37:58.142 --> 38:03.011
Chef's salad. Tuna melt. Tuna on rye.

38:03.180 --> 38:05.080
I don't know, Steve.
You're getting good at this.

38:05.249 --> 38:06.716
Maybe you've found
your true calling.

38:06.884 --> 38:09.011
You're not gonna have Steve
to kick around much longer.

38:09.186 --> 38:10.312
I've hired three new waiters.

38:10.488 --> 38:13.685
Oh, we'll always have Steve
to kick around.

38:19.096 --> 38:22.588
Steve, Steve, Steve, never
hit the pound and then the total.

38:22.767 --> 38:25.531
Clear it and start over again, okay?

38:28.205 --> 38:30.969
Ought to keep you around
as a consultant, man.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.473
You don't have that much money.

38:36.614 --> 38:39.105
Oh, no.

38:42.953 --> 38:44.181
Hi, guys.

38:44.355 --> 38:45.481
- Hi, Andrea.
- Hi, Andrea.

38:45.656 --> 38:48.819
I'm glad you're all here.

38:49.393 --> 38:51.418
I wanna be with my friends tonight.

38:51.796 --> 38:54.526
L... Well, we have...

38:54.699 --> 38:56.894
We have something
we wanna tell you.

38:58.035 --> 39:00.367
- You wanna tell them?
- No, go ahead, tell them.

39:00.538 --> 39:02.233
I don't know where to start.

39:02.873 --> 39:04.272
Well, come on.

39:04.809 --> 39:06.834
Well, first things first.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.506
Jesse and I are getting married.

39:10.047 --> 39:12.106
- Wow, so we're all going to Vegas?
- All right.

39:12.283 --> 39:13.773
- No, wrong.
- Good thinking.

39:13.951 --> 39:15.009
- All right, man.
- Thanks.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.949
Congratulations, man.
Welcome to the family.

39:17.121 --> 39:18.645
- Thanks.
- Way to go.

39:18.823 --> 39:21.986
- Thanks.
- There's just one more thing.

39:24.562 --> 39:25.824
We're gonna have a baby.

39:26.230 --> 39:28.528
- You're what?
- We're gonna have a baby.

39:28.699 --> 39:29.996
You are?

39:30.167 --> 39:31.759
- Oh, I'm so happy.
- That's great.

39:34.071 --> 39:36.266
I told you this would all work out.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.169
Let me in there.

39:39.076 --> 39:41.442
Not enough elbow room,
the kid's kicking up a storm.

39:41.612 --> 39:43.375
It's not. It's gas, isn't that gas?

39:43.547 --> 39:44.878
Don't ask me. I'm just the father.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.574
Oh, this is so exciting.
Can I babysit?

39:47.752 --> 39:49.185
You can all babysit.

39:49.353 --> 39:51.583
Oh, I have to tell David.
I have to call him.

39:51.756 --> 39:53.747
You know, Zuckerman,
you catch me by surprise here.

39:53.924 --> 39:56.654
And I'm out of cigars,

39:57.962 --> 39:59.156
but these should do the trick.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.355
- Right, everybody?
- Yeah.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.294
What made you change your mind?

40:08.572 --> 40:10.005
She did.

40:10.174 --> 40:11.300
He did.

40:11.475 --> 40:13.602
Whatever. As long as it's not twins.

40:13.778 --> 40:15.837
- What's wrong with twins?
- What's wrong with twins?

40:16.013 --> 40:18.504
Don't even think it.

40:19.183 --> 40:21.413
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

40:21.585 --> 40:24.383
David, are you there? Pick up.

40:24.555 --> 40:25.886
Hello?

40:26.056 --> 40:28.718
Oh, well, if you get this message,
come to the Peach Pit right away.

40:28.893 --> 40:31.885
You're not gonna believe this,
but Andrea is having a baby.

40:32.062 --> 40:35.498
Everybody is here. Where are you?

40:36.300 --> 40:37.665
Bye.

40:50.414 --> 40:53.008
Come on in. You're just in time.

41:02.326 --> 41:04.123
This is David.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.319
Hi.

41:06.497 --> 41:09.489
You haven't done meth
till you've shot it, man.

41:10.935 --> 41:13.130
I don't know, man.
I've never done anything like that.

41:13.437 --> 41:15.701
Well, that's why there's
a first time for everything.

41:16.674 --> 41:18.471
Hold that, darling.

41:19.343 --> 41:22.710
My turn. Let's see.

41:23.581 --> 41:26.846
Which little piggy's
going to market tonight?

41:41.499 --> 41:43.057
There we go.

41:43.234 --> 41:45.532
Yeah, well, that's better.

41:45.703 --> 41:49.400
No muss, no fuss, no tracks.

41:53.944 --> 41:55.878
How about it, David?

41:56.981 --> 42:00.041
Take your shoes off, sit a spell.

42:12.763 --> 42:15.459
- Brandon.
- How you doing?

42:16.066 --> 42:17.533
It's late.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.396
I'm kind of in the
middle of something.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.637
This will just take a minute.

42:33.918 --> 42:36.113
I hope you're not here
to lay some trip on me.

42:36.287 --> 42:39.154
I've taken enough lumps recently.
I don't think I could take any more.

42:39.323 --> 42:41.416
It's a friendly visit. Relax.

42:42.860 --> 42:44.122
Well, I'd get you something,

42:44.295 --> 42:47.423
but I've been living on
a lot of takeout food lately.

42:48.432 --> 42:50.832
It's okay, I'm fine.

42:51.468 --> 42:53.231
It's actually you I'm worried about.

42:53.804 --> 42:56.136
I heard you and Corey broke up.

42:56.307 --> 42:57.706
Not a real fun time.

42:57.875 --> 42:59.502
I can imagine.

43:00.444 --> 43:02.605
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry.

43:02.780 --> 43:04.247
I hope what happened
between you two

43:04.415 --> 43:07.043
didn't have anything to do
with something we did.

43:07.217 --> 43:09.879
Brandon, we didn't do anything.

43:10.688 --> 43:14.818
All that happened was it made me
realize how unhappy I was with Corey.

43:15.693 --> 43:16.717
And believe me,

43:16.894 --> 43:19.556
if there's any blame to go around,
it could be left on my doorstep.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.991
I mean, jeez, rather than
be honest with my husband,

43:23.167 --> 43:26.432
I just made him so miserable he had no
other choice but to give me the boot.

43:26.937 --> 43:28.529
And now you wish he hadn't?

43:28.839 --> 43:30.568
No.

43:31.475 --> 43:33.943
I just wish I hadn't
been such a coward.

43:36.847 --> 43:40.977
I put him through a textbook case
of how men handle breakups,

43:41.151 --> 43:43.119
because I didn't have the guts
to do it myself.

43:45.289 --> 43:49.123
And you, a teacher
of feminist politics.

43:50.794 --> 43:53.661
Could you keep that a secret?
I'm trying to retain a little dignity here.

43:53.831 --> 43:55.458
I'll do my best.

43:57.768 --> 44:00.498
So need a hand
moving anything heavy?

44:00.671 --> 44:02.263
Sure.

44:02.439 --> 44:06.341
As I recall, your arms
were quite strong.

44:10.614 --> 44:13.378
And I could really use a friend
right about now.

44:14.084 --> 44:15.881
Well, you got one.
