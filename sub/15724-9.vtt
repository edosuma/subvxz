00:00.076 --> 00:01.972
I'm going blind David. I'm sorry.

00:02.385 --> 00:03.687
It's not gonna happen, Bob.

00:04.774 --> 00:07.380
It's alright. I can make it work.

00:07.646 --> 00:08.646
I can't.

00:08.835 --> 00:11.364
The FBI received an anonymous call.
Something about...

00:11.514 --> 00:14.511
- a smiley face you might've received.
- Something like this?

00:15.929 --> 00:18.986
- It's smallpox.
- Smallpox was eradicated in 1980.

00:19.188 --> 00:21.612
But here's the thing: it's synthetic.

00:21.764 --> 00:23.178
That G should be an A.

00:23.558 --> 00:26.114
What about anthrax and glanders?
Do they think they're related?

00:26.264 --> 00:27.658
Hard to imagine they're not.

00:28.134 --> 00:29.495
Vaccine? Are we making it?

00:31.289 --> 00:32.723
- Yes.
<i>- Rachel's son, Craig.</i>

00:32.873 --> 00:34.625
- Just visiting?
- Actually, in transit.

00:34.777 --> 00:37.628
Algonquin Park. I'm studying
some aggressive bear behaviour up there.

00:38.723 --> 00:40.339
- Craig.
- I don't want to talk.

00:40.491 --> 00:43.594
- You two should try to work this out.
- Wanna have dinner? Just you and me?

00:44.027 --> 00:45.220
What do you want, Carl?

00:46.744 --> 00:48.169
I want you to sign those papers.

00:48.319 --> 00:50.411
So someone can just build smallpox.

00:50.561 --> 00:52.702
Any university lab would do it.

00:53.071 --> 00:55.140
So how do we go about finding this guy?

00:55.567 --> 00:57.398
We don't have to. He's found us.

00:57.744 --> 00:59.124
"Time to go public."

01:04.931 --> 01:06.676
- Any luck with the trace yet?
- Nothing.

01:06.826 --> 01:09.082
But I have a feeling
we're getting really close.

01:09.232 --> 01:11.496
Locking onto the geoposition
of that cell.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.105
It's about time.

01:16.598 --> 01:17.587
He's in the US.

01:17.926 --> 01:18.753
East coast.

01:20.278 --> 01:21.088
Manhattan.

01:25.571 --> 01:26.636
42nd and Lexington.

01:27.146 --> 01:29.514
- Grand Central Station.
- I'll alert Homeland and FBI.

Version NoTag 1.0

03:44.008 --> 03:45.090
They disarmed it.

03:45.339 --> 03:47.485
- Thank God for that.
- There are samples on route.

03:49.173 --> 03:51.530
- This doesn't make any sense.
- What's that?

03:51.682 --> 03:53.906
The guy's smart enough
to create smallpox from scratch.

03:54.056 --> 03:56.501
He's clever enough
to plant the smallpox bomb

03:56.651 --> 03:58.773
in Grand Central Station
without getting caught.

03:59.004 --> 04:02.084
But then he sends a message to me that
practically tells us where to find it.

04:02.685 --> 04:04.043
He wanted us to find it.

04:04.213 --> 04:06.417
Just like he wanted us
to find the mistake in the code.

04:07.121 --> 04:09.256
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

04:10.486 --> 04:12.726
Whatever this guy's up to,
he's not finished yet though.

04:24.901 --> 04:25.901
Rachel.

04:26.459 --> 04:28.192
- That the smallpox from New York?
- Yeah.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.295
I'm gonna run a 4-5-4 genomic
analysis and DNA chips, too.

04:32.380 --> 04:33.197
Error rate.

04:33.347 --> 04:35.820
Yeah, it's higher, but I figured speed
was the thing here...

04:35.977 --> 04:38.160
What about the infectivity
of the sample sent to me?

04:39.216 --> 04:41.122
The vero cells
we infected are still healthy.

04:41.272 --> 04:43.159
We'll know later tonight
just how deadly it is.

04:43.309 --> 04:44.309
Keep me posted.

04:50.106 --> 04:51.083
Great. Thanks.

04:54.430 --> 04:57.041
- What are you doing here?
- I was leaving you a note.

04:57.411 --> 04:59.101
I don't like to be investigated.

05:00.304 --> 05:02.520
If you want to see
the state of my financial affairs,

05:02.670 --> 05:06.201
my lawyer will provide whatever he feels
is necessary to reach a settlement.

05:06.633 --> 05:08.394
- Ah.
- Yeah, thanks.

05:08.891 --> 05:09.932
So, wh...

05:10.337 --> 05:12.109
What if I want the truth?

05:13.578 --> 05:15.461
Have your lawyer call mine.

05:23.784 --> 05:24.798
Sorry.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.128
Okay. We have an outbreak
of glanders and anthrax

05:29.280 --> 05:31.777
on the west coast,
and then along comes our guy

05:31.927 --> 05:34.216
with his homemade smallpox
on the east coast.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.218
Are they connected?
I'm not so sure anymore.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.375
Why?

05:37.617 --> 05:40.890
Out west, you've got this crudely
weaponized anthrax and back east...

05:41.042 --> 05:42.672
... state-of the-art science.

05:42.941 --> 05:45.767
David's right. To synthesize smallpox,
you'd have to be brilliant.

05:46.016 --> 05:47.488
Now, let's look at intent.

05:47.638 --> 05:50.399
The anthrax and the glanders
were released in the middle of nowhere.

05:50.635 --> 05:52.840
Using a forest fire
to spread the crud around.

05:53.692 --> 05:55.175
Just random bio-terrorism.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.156
Our smallpox guy,

05:57.838 --> 06:00.553
big game hunter:
very specific, midtown Manhattan.

06:00.810 --> 06:03.829
You're trying to tell me that these are
simultaneous and unrelated threats?

06:04.618 --> 06:06.749
From now on, we're looking at
two separate incidents.

06:06.901 --> 06:08.652
Mayko, you're with Rachel
on the smallpox.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.887
We need to find out who this guy is.
Bob...

06:11.256 --> 06:12.697
you're with me on the fire.

06:16.077 --> 06:18.219
<i>Two new cases of anthrax,
one of glanders.</i>

06:18.369 --> 06:20.888
<i>- But we have a more serious problem.</i>
- Why? What's going on?

06:21.187 --> 06:23.029
<i>The winds have really begun
to pick up here.</i>

06:23.179 --> 06:25.309
<i>It's turning into a rank 6 crown fire.</i>

06:25.461 --> 06:27.645
<i>- Meaning?</i>
- Meaning that the fire is literally

06:27.797 --> 06:29.396
rolling across the top of the forest.

06:29.548 --> 06:31.923
Now they're back-burning
dumping fire retardants,

06:32.073 --> 06:34.802
but it looks highly probable
that we're going to be evacuated.

06:34.952 --> 06:37.471
These winds... They part of that storm
you guys were tracking?

06:37.621 --> 06:41.734
I'm sending you the latest projections
from Environment Canada.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.799
See, the storm centre is just north
of the Queen Charlotte Islands.

06:45.949 --> 06:48.022
- Is it coming ashore?
- Just a matter of time.

06:48.172 --> 06:49.287
And when it does,

06:49.471 --> 06:51.832
it's going to push the smoke south
down the coast.

06:51.982 --> 06:53.757
Now you see the actual pattern there.

06:53.909 --> 06:56.547
Cyclonic. Winds out of the north
and heading back to the west.

06:56.697 --> 06:58.425
If the whole system's tracking south...

06:58.934 --> 07:01.554
A whole storm cloud of pathogens
is gonna hit Vancouver.

07:01.706 --> 07:03.454
<i>Population of 2 million, David.</i>

07:03.833 --> 07:06.183
- Evacuation plans?
<i>- Yes, they're underway.</i>

07:06.529 --> 07:10.115
I've been working on procedures to kill
the glanders bacteria with sulfadiazine.

07:10.312 --> 07:12.495
But I'd better recalculate
based on this projection.

07:12.645 --> 07:15.073
- Can you send me the link?
<i>- Yeah, absolutely.</i>

07:15.511 --> 07:17.403
David? I've got some stuff to show you.

07:17.555 --> 07:19.647
Work up projections
based on these weather models.

07:19.797 --> 07:21.252
Best case, worst case scenarios.

07:21.402 --> 07:22.994
- Okay.
- Okay, so

07:23.144 --> 07:26.127
I am swapping data
with the FBI, CSIS and Interpol.

07:26.277 --> 07:28.581
We are trying to find
our guy through the suppliers.

07:28.733 --> 07:30.556
- That could take months, Mayko.
- Exactly.

07:30.706 --> 07:33.609
While they're taking the long route,
I'm trying to jump-start this thing.

07:33.759 --> 07:35.588
Here's a couple filters
I want to run by you.

07:35.740 --> 07:36.930
What are you thinking?

07:37.080 --> 07:41.701
We're looking at 438 suppliers worldwide
for customized DNA.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.513
We know he orders small pieces.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.146
I'm thinking maybe 75 bases.

07:46.296 --> 07:47.814
That's about 2500 orders

07:47.964 --> 07:50.479
- to build the entire smallpox virus.
- Okay.

07:50.629 --> 07:52.128
The first assumption is:

07:52.278 --> 07:54.481
this smallpox guy,
he'd wanna get lost in the shuffle.

07:54.633 --> 07:57.174
Right? So he'd spread his orders around
to avoid detection.

07:58.262 --> 08:01.645
Second assumption: He'd wanna lose
himself in the sheer volume of orders,

08:01.795 --> 08:04.241
so he's gonna go with big suppliers.

08:04.452 --> 08:07.284
I'm cutting this down
to the hundred biggest supply houses.

08:07.434 --> 08:09.455
So our guy is doing business
with these companies.

08:09.774 --> 08:11.415
Right. And then the next filter.

08:11.567 --> 08:14.026
He'd need a level 3 containment facility

08:14.176 --> 08:16.925
to safely replicate the smallpox.

08:17.785 --> 08:18.658
There.

08:19.262 --> 08:22.343
Good work. As soon as you get this list,
run it by Rachel.

08:22.495 --> 08:24.355
She knows this world
better than any of us.

08:24.505 --> 08:25.857
Oh, and one more filter.

08:26.180 --> 08:27.973
I want you to focus
on American researchers.

08:28.125 --> 08:29.132
Why?

08:29.410 --> 08:31.247
Apart from
the World Trade Center bombing,

08:31.397 --> 08:34.303
almost every major act
of domestic terrorism on U. S. soil

08:34.453 --> 08:36.774
was perpetrated by American citizens.

08:38.076 --> 08:38.931
What?

08:39.081 --> 08:41.057
<i>Doctor Sandstr√∂m, it's Robbie McCain.</i>

08:41.986 --> 08:42.991
Who?

08:43.412 --> 08:45.422
Robbie McCain. We met in Utah.

08:45.572 --> 08:47.530
- You with the ATF?
- At Greenway.

08:47.869 --> 08:51.205
My wife, Leslie, was one of
the scientists killed in the explosion.

08:52.396 --> 08:54.440
Oh, right, of course, Robbie.

08:54.590 --> 08:56.555
Um, how you doing?

08:57.072 --> 08:59.421
I'm in Toronto. I'd like to see you.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.739
- David, I just heard...
- That'd be great, Robbie,

09:01.889 --> 09:04.593
but we're all sort of on a full boil
around here right now.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.431
It's about the explosion at Greenway.

09:06.845 --> 09:08.048
I think I have something

09:08.198 --> 09:10.396
- you'll find very interesting.
- What do you mean?

09:10.546 --> 09:12.604
I don't want to tell you over the phone.

09:13.487 --> 09:15.532
Okay, why don't you come
by the lab tomorrow?

09:15.682 --> 09:16.687
Thank you.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.536
- Something about Greenway.
- Really? What's up?

09:24.142 --> 09:26.753
I did historical research
into our glanders problem.

09:26.903 --> 09:29.062
Specifically, the outbreak
that happened 60 years ago.

09:29.212 --> 09:31.122
Nice of you to show some initiative.

09:31.272 --> 09:33.462
- I think I might have found something.
- Hang on.

09:33.612 --> 09:36.614
We'd have the story on the NY smallpox
in a few hours. In the meantime,

09:36.767 --> 09:38.731
- the test result on the anthrax strain.
- And?

09:38.881 --> 09:39.682
Asian!

09:39.904 --> 09:44.216
Yeah, it's a 1939 strain
identified in Manchuria by a Dr. Ogawa.

09:44.368 --> 09:46.301
Dr. Ogawa of Unit 7-31?

09:47.746 --> 09:48.721
That's him.

09:48.873 --> 09:50.175
Unit 7-31?

09:51.000 --> 09:54.023
He was part of the Japanese army's
biological weapons division.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.300
I did my doctoral thesis

09:56.450 --> 09:59.237
on wartime Japanese Intelligence
in the Pacific theatre.

10:01.108 --> 10:03.318
So how does somebody get their hands

10:03.470 --> 10:06.405
on WW2-era anthrax? Chinese army, maybe?

10:07.243 --> 10:10.254
- Well, it could be from 1939.
- An old Japanese military stockpile?

10:11.270 --> 10:13.090
That might square with what I found.

10:13.355 --> 10:15.701
Mayko's working up a list
of potential smallpox suspects.

10:15.854 --> 10:18.488
Have a look at that
while you're waiting for the results.

10:23.365 --> 10:24.633
Oh, hey, perfect.

10:24.783 --> 10:26.409
Okay. So these are American researchers

10:26.559 --> 10:29.466
who ordered the DNA sequences that
you'd need to synthesize the smallpox.

10:29.616 --> 10:32.095
They had experience and lab facilities
to pull this off.

10:32.245 --> 10:34.532
- How many candidates?
- 974.

10:34.682 --> 10:36.787
I'll take a look,
see if anything pops out at me.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.635
I'll forward it to a few colleagues,

10:38.785 --> 10:40.467
- see if they have any thoughts.
- Okay.

10:46.423 --> 10:48.700
Mayko's working up
a list of potential smallpox suspects.

10:48.850 --> 10:51.492
Have a look at that
while you're waiting for the results.

10:53.748 --> 10:55.164
I heard about this laser therapy

10:55.314 --> 10:57.836
for use on glaucoma patients.
I thought it might work with Bob.

10:57.986 --> 10:59.799
The procedure's pretty routine
these days.

10:59.949 --> 11:03.132
You take a laser, you drill
these tiny holes in the retina

11:03.282 --> 11:05.630
- to release the interocular pressure.
- Would it work?

11:05.780 --> 11:08.842
The glaucoma maybe, but it's not gonna
correct the damage to the optic nerve.

11:09.234 --> 11:11.485
- So how do that?
- That's the billion dollar question.

11:11.635 --> 11:12.840
Whaddya got for me?

11:13.422 --> 11:15.798
The last glanders outbreak
in North America

11:15.948 --> 11:18.602
- happened in 1945.
- Tell me something I don't know.

11:18.757 --> 11:20.832
You know this is weird.
Come take a look at this.

11:25.242 --> 11:27.379
This is
where the current outbreak is occurring.

11:29.065 --> 11:31.198
This is
where the 1945 outbreak occurred.

11:33.437 --> 11:35.780
It's 20km south of the current outbreak.

11:35.930 --> 11:38.163
That's too close to be a coincidence.

11:39.370 --> 11:43.961
Somehow, World War II-era Japanese
glanders and anthrax ended up in BC?

11:44.225 --> 11:45.624
- I guess.
- How?

11:46.040 --> 11:48.132
I'm not sure,
but there is one interesting fact.

11:48.284 --> 11:51.155
There was also a fire
connected to the 1945 outbreak.

11:53.592 --> 11:56.212
- Just glanders alright, no anthrax?
- Just glanders.

11:57.130 --> 11:58.142
Keep digging.

11:59.582 --> 12:01.395
But hurry, that storm's closing in.

12:04.210 --> 12:05.240
Bob.

12:05.390 --> 12:07.113
Where are you at with the sulfadiazine?

12:07.522 --> 12:09.386
I finished my algorithm.

12:09.939 --> 12:13.761
Assuming <i>Burkholderia mallei</i> is
at 10 parts per million on the ground.

12:13.911 --> 12:14.907
Nice kill curves.

12:15.057 --> 12:17.805
There are several problems.
If the fire advances on a 10km front,

12:17.955 --> 12:20.960
we would need over 200 water tankers
around the clock to kill the glanders.

12:21.110 --> 12:23.032
- Can we do it?
- Unlikely and even if we could,

12:23.182 --> 12:25.246
- flying would be challenging.
- To say the least.

12:25.396 --> 12:29.214
Bigger problem is that the antibiotics
only kill bacteria when they're growing.

12:29.366 --> 12:31.283
They wouldn't be growing
when they're airborne.

12:31.433 --> 12:34.343
- Should've caught that before.
- I missed it, too, Bob.

12:35.376 --> 12:37.180
- Are you humouring me?
- Absolutely not.

12:37.332 --> 12:39.136
You cast a wide net.
That's why you're here.

12:39.288 --> 12:42.394
Sometimes it works, sometimes not.
This time, you've gotta make it work.

12:43.507 --> 12:46.484
Looks like our smallpox guy
finally has something to say to us.

12:48.880 --> 12:52.493
Wes! Get Riddlemeyer back in here, ASAP!

12:53.495 --> 12:55.842
Hey, David. Here's the analysis
of the New York smallpox.

12:55.992 --> 12:58.736
- Same as the one that was sent to you.
- Same mistake in the code?

12:58.886 --> 13:01.708
Exactly. And we've got
the test results on the virulence.

13:03.541 --> 13:05.938
Healthy vero cells.
The guy designed a benign virus.

13:06.723 --> 13:09.362
- He must have known he was doing it.
- Why would he do it?

13:13.421 --> 13:14.885
To show it could be done.

13:15.923 --> 13:16.845
He's here.

13:17.496 --> 13:19.262
- Right there.
- Wait before you take off,

13:19.412 --> 13:21.311
here's my list of who
might have engineered it.

13:21.461 --> 13:23.430
Rachel's looked it over.
I'll send it on to FBI.

13:23.580 --> 13:26.188
- CSIS and Interpol already have it.
- Good work, guys.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.823
This is www.censorthenet.org.

13:38.561 --> 13:39.584
Censor the net?

13:39.894 --> 13:41.453
Bit late in the day, don't you think?

13:41.605 --> 13:44.792
Well, our smallpox guy wants
the international scientific community

13:44.942 --> 13:47.186
to appoint a panel
of Nobel prize winners

13:47.336 --> 13:50.917
to remove all dangerous scientific
information from the Internet,

13:51.296 --> 13:55.188
or he will release smallpox
in cities all across the U.S.

13:55.378 --> 13:56.510
Demand the impossible,

13:56.674 --> 13:58.129
threaten the unthinkable.

13:58.944 --> 14:01.038
Sounds like an ideological fanatic.

14:01.564 --> 14:02.898
Well, he has a point.

14:03.330 --> 14:04.559
You're agreeing with him?

14:04.711 --> 14:06.832
He managed to synthesize
one of the deadliest killers

14:06.982 --> 14:09.272
this planet's ever seen
from stuff he got from Internet.

14:10.165 --> 14:11.483
What does this maniac want?

14:13.809 --> 14:15.799
He wants us to know how fucked we are.

14:16.546 --> 14:19.307
He's sending his manifesto
to the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Post</i>.

14:19.457 --> 14:21.493
They won't publish anything
until they talk to us.

14:21.645 --> 14:22.598
You know,

14:22.748 --> 14:24.871
maybe we should just publish it.

14:25.536 --> 14:26.560
I beg your pardon.

14:26.710 --> 14:29.495
Not publishing it is just gonna make
this guy very upset

14:29.645 --> 14:31.635
and then who knows what he'll do.

14:33.138 --> 14:36.425
The United States government is not
gonna give in to terrorist demands.

14:36.577 --> 14:38.604
This guy's not a terrorist.

14:38.839 --> 14:40.377
This has been a big show, alright?

14:40.527 --> 14:43.353
It's a stunt to lead us
to censorthenet.org.

14:44.141 --> 14:45.559
And what are you basing this on?

14:45.711 --> 14:48.395
The guy builds a strain of smallpox
with a deliberate error in it

14:48.547 --> 14:50.105
that leads us to the Internet.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.534
Then he plants a bomb and he leads us
directly to that. He wanted it found.

14:53.685 --> 14:54.833
He's playing God?

14:54.983 --> 14:56.342
Show us what he's capable of.

14:57.119 --> 14:59.197
He could have released it
without telling anyone.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.075
You're actually supporting his position.

15:02.227 --> 15:04.786
I'm not taking any position. I'm just...

15:05.604 --> 15:06.580
What I'm saying

15:06.732 --> 15:09.554
is that, at heart,
I think whoever is behind this

15:09.704 --> 15:11.793
he's a person of conscience,
not a mass murderer.

15:11.945 --> 15:15.021
What do you think he'll do next
to prove his point?

15:15.171 --> 15:16.506
Let loose the real thing?

15:18.031 --> 15:19.158
I don't know.

15:19.644 --> 15:22.971
I know you think this guy's harmless.
But that's not your decision to make.

15:23.221 --> 15:24.179
Nor mine.

15:24.329 --> 15:27.702
I'm kicking this thing upstairs,
to the Joint Task Force on Terrorism.

15:57.022 --> 15:58.008
Okay.

15:59.514 --> 16:02.008
That's not possible.
I can't drive down now.

16:03.253 --> 16:06.376
Look, if you can't locate him
by tomorrow, give me a call.

16:06.526 --> 16:07.751
I'll see what I can do.

16:09.032 --> 16:10.033
She okay?

16:11.244 --> 16:12.248
Thanks.

16:13.197 --> 16:14.236
Problems?

16:15.146 --> 16:18.465
My idiot brother has vanished again
and my niece is stranded.

16:18.785 --> 16:20.480
I thought he found Jesus.

16:20.912 --> 16:21.916
Clearly.

16:22.410 --> 16:23.577
What do you got?

16:23.849 --> 16:24.893
Okay.

16:25.102 --> 16:27.413
So I dug a little bit further
into Unit 7-31.

16:27.810 --> 16:29.496
During the war Japan invades China.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.915
They set up Unit 7-31 in Manchuria.

16:32.237 --> 16:34.457
Now get this: officially, it is known as

16:34.643 --> 16:37.272
the Kempeitai Political Department

16:37.422 --> 16:39.878
and Epidemic Prevention
Research Laboratory.

16:40.224 --> 16:43.093
It was really top secret. Supposedly,
it was a water purification plant.

16:43.791 --> 16:47.639
Turns out they were experimenting
on more than just glanders and anthrax.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.526
They were doing research
on bubonic plague, typhoid,

16:51.703 --> 16:54.104
cholera, tuberculosis, songo fever.

16:54.442 --> 16:55.835
Who's who of germ warfare.

16:55.985 --> 16:57.460
They started to do experiments

16:57.610 --> 17:01.130
and tests on POWs
and the civilian Chinese population.

17:01.778 --> 17:04.644
They would tie a person to a stake
and test a germ bomb on them.

17:04.794 --> 17:07.951
They were infecting women and children,
then performing live vivisections

17:08.103 --> 17:09.868
to see how those diseases
were progressing.

17:10.019 --> 17:11.829
- Jesus.
- There are estimates that upwards

17:11.982 --> 17:14.085
of 200 000 people were killed.

17:14.516 --> 17:15.737
Here's the kicker.

17:15.887 --> 17:18.919
The U.S. government granted immunity
to all those Japanese scientists

17:19.069 --> 17:21.839
- in exchange for their research.
- Well, of course they would.

17:21.992 --> 17:24.444
I mean,
that's very hard research to come by.

17:24.594 --> 17:26.261
- Yeah, exactly.
- Fucking humanity.

17:27.165 --> 17:28.763
So how does this tie into BC?

17:29.495 --> 17:30.797
Take a look at this.

17:32.111 --> 17:33.273
What is that?

17:33.423 --> 17:35.437
This is a Fugo balloon.

17:35.754 --> 17:38.095
In the final days of the war,
the Japanese launched these

17:38.245 --> 17:40.233
as a last-ditch strike
against the United States.

17:41.276 --> 17:43.836
They would load this platform
with a bomb.

17:43.986 --> 17:47.199
Let me guess, sometimes that bomb
contained biological agents

17:47.351 --> 17:48.700
like anthrax and glanders.

17:48.898 --> 17:50.911
They were launching up to 500 a day

17:51.063 --> 17:53.223
into the jet stream
hoping it would cross the Pacific,

17:53.373 --> 17:55.730
detonate over North America
and spread a plague.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.001
Those Japanese were real cutting-edge.

17:58.153 --> 18:00.728
It was a total fucking failure.
A few people died in Oregon.

18:00.878 --> 18:04.468
Most of them just crashed into Pacific
or floated into never-never land.

18:04.618 --> 18:07.157
A release of these Fugos drifted
across the Pacific Ocean

18:07.307 --> 18:09.162
- and landed on our mountainside?
- Yeah.

18:09.312 --> 18:11.619
60 years later,
there's a forest fire, they detonate,

18:11.769 --> 18:13.767
and the pathogens are finally released.

18:13.919 --> 18:17.299
So it was a bio-terror attack.
Only it was launched 60 years ago.

18:20.158 --> 18:21.325
There could be...

18:22.179 --> 18:23.681
hundreds of these things.

18:28.746 --> 18:29.908
Get Carlos on the line.

18:32.704 --> 18:35.485
Bob, you got that data
for dispersing the sulfadiazine?

18:35.635 --> 18:37.123
- Yes.
- Grab it and get in here.

18:38.229 --> 18:39.918
Hey, how's it going out there?

18:40.793 --> 18:43.231
<i>The more important question is
how is everything going there?</i>

18:43.381 --> 18:45.924
We think we've got something.
Bring up the topographic map.

18:46.249 --> 18:49.339
Wes thinks we may be dealing
with some leftover Japanese bio-weapons

18:49.489 --> 18:51.304
carried over by Fugo balloons.

18:51.846 --> 18:52.681
What?

18:53.042 --> 18:55.177
They're weaponized balloons
the Japanese sent up

18:55.327 --> 18:57.143
in a hail-Mary attempt
at the end of WWII.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.813
It's a long story.
Just go with it. I think he's right.

18:59.965 --> 19:03.608
These are the most recent outbreaks
and the current position of the fire.

19:04.024 --> 19:07.279
Outbreak from 1945 was here,
20 Ks to the south.

19:07.696 --> 19:10.015
<i>Where did the fire in 1945 start?</i>

19:10.541 --> 19:12.729
Almost exactly
where the outbreak occurred.

19:12.879 --> 19:15.161
<i>Now fire spreads south.
But this was the only outbreak.</i>

19:15.478 --> 19:19.662
So imagine Fugo launch of 1945.
They float across the Pacific Ocean,

19:19.812 --> 19:21.918
they get to BC,
they get hit by some kind of storm,

19:22.526 --> 19:25.005
and they all come down
roughly in this area.

19:25.157 --> 19:27.485
<i>So the current outbreak could be
the northernmost Fugos.</i>

19:28.201 --> 19:30.260
And the 20km of unburnt forest
in between

19:30.412 --> 19:33.471
could be hiding God knows
how many unexploded bio-weapons.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.974
David, we will never find them in time.

19:36.126 --> 19:38.806
<i>I know. We don't have to. Bob! Bob?</i>

19:44.080 --> 19:45.080
Here's the data.

19:46.015 --> 19:48.445
Bob, remind me again.
The storm is cyclonic, right?

19:48.599 --> 19:50.864
Winds are blowing down
from north and then moving west?

19:51.520 --> 19:53.408
We load up these planes
with an accelerant.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.233
Napalm, if we have to.
We burn the entire chunk of land.

19:56.383 --> 19:57.313
Whoa, David.

19:57.463 --> 20:01.071
<i>You have 200 square kilometres
with a potential lethal pathogen.</i>

20:01.221 --> 20:02.834
<i>What about Vancouver?</i>

20:02.986 --> 20:04.019
No. We time it.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.920
We do the burn
right when the weather front moves over.

20:07.070 --> 20:10.132
The winds pick up any pathogens released
and carry them out over the Pacific.

20:10.282 --> 20:12.197
They'll be dispersed
before they hit Vancouver.

20:12.847 --> 20:15.250
<i>What's the population
between the fire and the ocean?</i>

20:15.550 --> 20:16.681
Fairrly sparse.

20:16.839 --> 20:19.642
We could do an evacuation.
We'd have to get on it right now.

20:19.794 --> 20:23.659
Okay, so we're looking at
a 200 million-square metre burn area,

20:23.809 --> 20:26.399
with an efficiency of 2300 square metres

20:26.551 --> 20:28.921
per 625 litre drum of napalm...

20:29.071 --> 20:30.195
Can it be done, Bob?

20:32.876 --> 20:35.196
We need 1811 sorties or thereabouts.

20:35.346 --> 20:38.482
Oh, but if we let the fire itself
do the bulk of the work, then...

20:40.666 --> 20:41.498
Yes.

20:41.650 --> 20:43.249
It's our only shot. Call Riddlemeyer.

20:43.399 --> 20:45.522
Have him to scramble
the US and Canadian Air Forces.

20:45.672 --> 20:46.503
I'm on it.

20:46.669 --> 20:48.380
<i>I'll get started on the evacuation.</i>

20:49.100 --> 20:50.152
Bob.

20:50.922 --> 20:51.758
Good work.

20:52.595 --> 20:54.939
- You too.
- Go home and get some sleep.

20:55.838 --> 20:56.838
Thanks.

21:04.494 --> 21:05.503
Bob,

21:05.699 --> 21:07.280
what are you doing still here?

21:07.430 --> 21:09.122
- Thinking.
- About what?

21:09.749 --> 21:12.987
The most famous blind botanist
was George Eberhard Rumphius.

21:13.210 --> 21:15.156
He went blind in 1670,
but he kept working

21:15.308 --> 21:18.163
on his 6-volume catalogue
of all the plants in Indonesia.

21:18.313 --> 21:20.777
Then, his wife and child
were killed in an earthquake

21:20.927 --> 21:23.790
and the ship carrying his manuscript
to the Netherlands was attacked

21:23.942 --> 21:27.090
and sunk by the French.
So he had to start all over again.

21:27.414 --> 21:28.795
Okay, that's awful.

21:28.947 --> 21:31.840
His masterpiece wasn't published
until 39 years after his death.

21:32.784 --> 21:35.635
- Bob, that's a horrible story.
- Actually, it's reassuring.

21:36.303 --> 21:37.593
Things work out.

21:37.947 --> 21:39.431
We just have to be patient.

21:49.849 --> 21:52.277
David, I've been told
the target area has been cleared.

21:52.631 --> 21:53.839
So where are we at?

21:54.151 --> 21:57.758
Bombers are taking off from Fairchild
Air Force Base in Washington,

21:58.614 --> 22:00.625
CFB Comox and Elmendorf in Alaska.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.423
- And the storm?
- Proceeding as our model suggested.

22:03.605 --> 22:06.896
We have a pretty tight 3-hour window,
but it can happen.

22:08.193 --> 22:09.196
Okay.

22:09.596 --> 22:10.649
So we do it?

22:11.400 --> 22:13.018
- Do it.
- Right.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.388
Dr. Sandstr√∂m?

22:30.115 --> 22:31.303
Robbie McCain.

22:31.509 --> 22:32.532
Robbie.

22:33.408 --> 22:36.028
I really appreciate...
Thanks for taking the time.

22:36.178 --> 22:38.841
No, I'm glad you caught me.
I gotta admit, I completely forgot.

22:39.594 --> 22:41.367
I hear you're looking for someone.

22:41.519 --> 22:42.928
I think I can help.

22:46.787 --> 22:48.569
Yeah, why don't you...

22:49.285 --> 22:50.810
why don't you sign in?

22:53.834 --> 22:55.226
Since Leslie died,

22:55.861 --> 22:58.718
I've been kind of fixated
on Auflander Docheimer.

22:59.292 --> 23:01.053
As far as I'm concerned they killed her.

23:01.242 --> 23:03.847
Secret research projects,
no control, no peer review.

23:04.072 --> 23:05.383
No wonder bad shit happened.

23:05.617 --> 23:08.181
You said over the phone
you wanted to talk about Greenway.

23:08.377 --> 23:10.630
Greenway's just the tip of the iceberg.

23:10.999 --> 23:12.401
Secret lab in India.

23:12.564 --> 23:15.998
They're supposed to be researching
environmentally friendly pesticides.

23:16.277 --> 23:18.863
They release methyl osocyanate
into the atmosphere.

23:19.141 --> 23:20.824
400 innocent people die.

23:21.204 --> 23:24.010
Norway. They claim
they're working on clean nuclear fuels.

23:24.227 --> 23:26.329
They release radioactive isotopes
into the fjord

23:26.577 --> 23:28.414
Poison an entire population
of wild salmon.

23:28.884 --> 23:31.465
This is science out of control,
Dr. Sandstr√∂m.

23:33.315 --> 23:35.998
Robbie, you said
you knew who I was looking for.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.457
Who is it?

23:39.579 --> 23:41.225
He's a man like yourself.

23:42.058 --> 23:44.065
Who cares about the fate of mankind.

23:44.299 --> 23:46.266
He got concerned
when he was working at DARPA.

23:47.690 --> 23:49.185
Did he voice his concerns?

23:49.417 --> 23:51.301
He told DARPA something had to be done.

23:51.496 --> 23:52.856
Dangerous science, everywhere.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.649
And he was right.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.932
I mean, you want to build yourself
a nuclear bomb,

23:57.116 --> 23:59.283
a deadly virus,
it's all right there on the Internet.

23:59.433 --> 24:01.685
- How did DARPA respond?
- They didn't.

24:04.026 --> 24:05.951
So he thought he'd just go out
and do a little

24:06.136 --> 24:07.412
pilot project, right?

24:08.467 --> 24:11.791
Fabricate smallpox from a recipe
freely found on Internet.

24:11.963 --> 24:13.344
A harmless strain.

24:16.328 --> 24:17.755
You didn't want to hurt anybody?

24:18.031 --> 24:19.567
I was making a point.

24:21.012 --> 24:23.203
I wanted to get the world's attention.

24:23.464 --> 24:24.804
Spark an international debate

24:24.956 --> 24:28.257
about the fact that science
is totally out of control.

24:29.619 --> 24:30.619
It didn't work.

24:32.677 --> 24:34.283
Not a word in the press.

24:35.029 --> 24:36.453
Thousands of people out there

24:36.610 --> 24:38.817
could make a bug
that'd decimate the human race.

24:39.065 --> 24:40.904
And they may not be as benevolent as me.

24:41.663 --> 24:43.329
I don't disagree with you.

24:43.586 --> 24:46.492
But I also think that scientists need
a free flow of information.

24:46.842 --> 24:48.426
Censorship isn't the answer.

24:48.611 --> 24:50.392
You're an idealist, Dr. Sandstr√∂m.

24:50.628 --> 24:53.082
In your world, science is benevolent.

24:53.548 --> 24:56.450
Companies are ethical.
That's not the real world. Not anymore.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.714
I don't think science is benevolent.
I think it's benign.

24:59.928 --> 25:03.051
It's for discovery, that's it, okay?
The problem is in application.

25:03.203 --> 25:05.156
And I don't think
corporations are ethical,

25:05.306 --> 25:07.105
but I do think people can be.

25:10.704 --> 25:12.936
Is there any more smallpox out there?

25:15.237 --> 25:16.237
No.

25:19.853 --> 25:20.853
Okay.

25:26.937 --> 25:28.227
I want your help.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.791
I want to be arrested and tried.

25:31.058 --> 25:33.748
But the real trial, see,
will be the state of science.

25:34.248 --> 25:36.501
Kinda like a <i>Scopes Monkey Trial</i>
for the ages.

25:37.072 --> 25:39.653
It'll put this whole issue
on the front page.

25:39.831 --> 25:41.346
I'm afraid not, Robbie.

25:47.184 --> 25:51.476
The FBI shortlist of all the scientists
they think could have made the smallpox.

25:52.312 --> 25:55.179
Homeland Security nails you, you'll be
declared an enemy of the state.

25:55.353 --> 25:57.939
And if that happens,
there's not gonna be a trial, ever.

25:58.277 --> 26:00.803
You'll go straight to Git'mo
or some black camp in the Balkans

26:00.953 --> 26:02.455
for an indefinite stay.

26:12.098 --> 26:15.558
I'm gonna give you a chance
to step back from the brink, okay?

26:15.915 --> 26:18.501
I'll write an op-ed piece for <i>The Times,</i>

26:18.653 --> 26:20.335
outline your "pilot project"

26:20.511 --> 26:24.757
and explain what you, what this unknown
person wanted to say to the world.

26:25.631 --> 26:28.314
I know it's spit in the wind
but I'll do it.

26:29.818 --> 26:30.821
That's it, then?

26:32.268 --> 26:35.245
Well, I could pick up the phone
and have you arrested, if you like.

26:37.383 --> 26:38.938
Do what you have to do.

26:40.197 --> 26:41.671
I'm just the messenger.

27:01.904 --> 27:03.018
How you doin'?

27:06.272 --> 27:07.272
Thanks.

27:57.170 --> 27:59.932
Guy gets gunned down in cold blood
in front of my office,

28:00.082 --> 28:02.095
and I'm not allowed
to talk to the detectives?

28:02.247 --> 28:04.856
- It's a question of national security.
- The guy was executed!

28:05.006 --> 28:06.459
- Who gave the order?
- No one.

28:06.637 --> 28:08.694
Those agents made
a split-second decision.

28:08.846 --> 28:10.491
- Bullshit!
- Bullshit.

28:11.388 --> 28:13.491
We wanted him alive as much as anyone.

28:14.008 --> 28:16.248
Was he a lone gunman?
Was he working with anyone else?

28:16.398 --> 28:19.080
- We don't know if he had more smallpox.
- He told me he didn't.

28:19.313 --> 28:21.120
And that's it? That's your proof?

28:21.280 --> 28:23.945
We didn't want that man dead.
We've just lost an important asset.

28:24.118 --> 28:25.253
- Asset? Asset!

28:25.866 --> 28:28.744
That guy created smallpox. You don't
realize how incredible that is,

28:28.894 --> 28:30.550
but that man was a fucking genius.

28:31.014 --> 28:33.400
- How'd they even know he was here?
- He was your contact,

28:33.550 --> 28:35.805
so we've had agents sitting on you
from the beginning.

28:36.785 --> 28:38.932
- For your own protection, I might add.
- No...

28:39.082 --> 28:40.820
they confronted him after he met me.

28:41.002 --> 28:42.628
You were already in the meeting,

28:42.778 --> 28:45.815
and we were working on a short list
of suspects that your people provided.

28:45.967 --> 28:47.674
And once that info was downloaded,

28:47.824 --> 28:49.879
the FBI software made the match.

28:50.081 --> 28:51.556
If the match was made before that,

28:51.706 --> 28:54.555
if we'd made it earlier, he would
have been apprehended in your office.

28:54.705 --> 28:56.613
You mean he would have been
shot in my office!

28:56.786 --> 28:58.995
Listen to me, David.
There's a little matter here

28:59.795 --> 29:01.090
of you letting that man,

29:01.247 --> 29:03.827
whom you obviously knew
had something to do with this,

29:03.977 --> 29:06.735
you let him walk away scot-free. Now,

29:06.900 --> 29:10.033
that's aiding and abetting,
some people might even say treason.

29:10.196 --> 29:11.532
You threatening me?

29:11.777 --> 29:12.794
No, no.

29:13.109 --> 29:14.195
Not at all.

29:14.746 --> 29:16.074
I'm just saying...

29:16.361 --> 29:18.305
everything can be managed.

29:28.940 --> 29:30.026
You know what it is?

29:30.178 --> 29:32.048
It's state-sponsored terrorism.

29:32.758 --> 29:35.321
Fuck. The guy synthesized smallpox,

29:35.503 --> 29:37.575
and that is a fucking
amazing achievement.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.553
Amazing and horrifying, David!

29:39.727 --> 29:42.547
And horrifying, yeah.
But the point is he did it.

29:43.052 --> 29:44.583
Think for a minute, if he was right?

29:44.733 --> 29:45.915
- Riddlemeyer?
- Yes.

29:46.065 --> 29:47.764
- Bullshit.
- No, just think about it.

29:47.938 --> 29:50.533
I mean, who's to say Robbie McCain
wasn't working with someone?

29:50.683 --> 29:53.406
- He could have been part of a group.
- I don't think so.

29:53.556 --> 29:54.960
I think he was a lone wolf.

29:55.241 --> 29:56.876
Step back from it for a moment.

29:57.543 --> 29:58.860
If he were working alone,

29:59.010 --> 30:01.429
he'd have to have been working
on this genome for years.

30:01.579 --> 30:02.792
And from what you say,

30:02.942 --> 30:05.603
he only decided to take action
after Leslie's death.

30:06.084 --> 30:07.825
It's an impossible timeline, David.

30:08.013 --> 30:10.733
I mean really,
just who was Robbie McCain?

30:10.883 --> 30:12.610
- We know nothing about him.
- Alright...

30:13.182 --> 30:14.195
Point taken.

30:14.844 --> 30:15.863
Smells good.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.830
- Oh hey!
- Thank god. A distraction.

30:17.993 --> 30:19.959
I think that I need a drink.

30:20.183 --> 30:22.338
- Red?
- Please.

30:22.883 --> 30:25.922
- How did it turn out after the burn?
- Smoke tested clean.

30:26.116 --> 30:29.085
- And the pathogens?
- Scattered all over the Pacific.

30:30.093 --> 30:31.895
- Good work.
- Hey man, you look good.

30:34.971 --> 30:38.092
Weston and I made a series of models
based on other Fugo launches

30:38.246 --> 30:39.841
that may have landed in North America.

30:39.991 --> 30:43.582
That projection was sent
to the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers.

30:43.789 --> 30:45.516
They're gonna coordinate
a ground search.

30:45.666 --> 30:46.758
Okay, good...

30:48.415 --> 30:49.419
Hello.

30:51.489 --> 30:53.066
Oh my God. When?

30:55.465 --> 30:56.940
Okay, w... where?

30:57.747 --> 30:59.556
Alright, I'll be right there.

31:03.916 --> 31:06.330
Guys, I'm so sorry, I've gotta run,
I'll call you later.

31:10.472 --> 31:11.382
What happened?

31:17.839 --> 31:18.839
Rachel!

31:20.117 --> 31:21.202
Where is he?

31:21.398 --> 31:23.789
- They're still working on him.
- What happened?

31:24.205 --> 31:25.678
They were attacked by some bear.

31:25.828 --> 31:26.828
Oh Jesus!

31:29.835 --> 31:30.839
Oh God.

31:31.439 --> 31:32.690
Guardedly good news.

31:33.135 --> 31:34.179
We saved his arm.

31:34.590 --> 31:35.943
He's lost these 2 fingers.

31:36.217 --> 31:40.134
He'll need extensive plastic surgery
to reconstruct this region of his face.

31:40.442 --> 31:41.866
But your son is out of danger.

31:44.356 --> 31:45.619
His friend isn't so lucky.

31:45.864 --> 31:48.748
Shock and blood loss.
There was nothing we could do.

31:49.532 --> 31:50.532
Ah no.

31:51.480 --> 31:54.784
These are Craig's personal effects
that came back on the medivac flight.

31:55.973 --> 31:57.840
- Thank you.
- Wait. We...

31:57.992 --> 31:59.050
We wanna see him.

31:59.202 --> 32:02.053
- He's in twilight from the anesthetic.
- Please.

32:12.888 --> 32:13.888
Sweetheart.

32:15.843 --> 32:17.244
It's gonna be okay.

32:21.243 --> 32:22.948
- Mom...
- Stay calm, Craig.

32:23.304 --> 32:24.541
You gotta rest.

32:27.859 --> 32:28.859
Whadda...

32:29.924 --> 32:31.398
'bout... Tom?

32:35.168 --> 32:36.221
Tom's fine.

32:37.724 --> 32:38.748
He's fine.

32:48.938 --> 32:50.228
So, when tomorrow?

32:53.073 --> 32:54.076
Oh.

32:54.403 --> 32:56.389
She said she could see us at 2.

32:56.986 --> 32:57.803
Okay.

32:59.852 --> 33:02.434
You know, Bob, this may not pan out,
but from what I've read

33:02.584 --> 33:05.060
about Dr. Turnbull's research,
it'll be worth the trip.

33:06.367 --> 33:07.297
Okay.

33:11.609 --> 33:13.227
I guess I should go home.

33:14.096 --> 33:15.231
I'll take you.

33:18.869 --> 33:19.872
Okay?

33:23.884 --> 33:25.604
Here, get your coat on.

33:29.742 --> 33:31.295
- David...
- There ya go.

33:31.541 --> 33:32.544
I...

33:33.159 --> 33:34.164
you...

33:35.232 --> 33:36.461
Well, hey hey...

33:37.730 --> 33:39.111
We're gonna fix you.

33:54.297 --> 33:55.402
Okay, good...

33:56.271 --> 33:57.324
Yeah, bye.

33:58.265 --> 34:01.370
- Looks like Craig's gonna make it.
- That's good news. How's Rachel?

34:01.520 --> 34:02.923
She's hanging in there.

34:03.568 --> 34:05.009
Dr. Turnbull will see you now.

34:05.161 --> 34:06.468
Oh great. Come on, Bob.

34:08.492 --> 34:11.108
We've been studying ways
to repair optic nerve damage

34:11.268 --> 34:12.659
for several years now.

34:12.862 --> 34:14.366
What we're doing is we're injecting

34:14.550 --> 34:17.130
a solution containing
self-assembling peptides

34:17.315 --> 34:18.963
into the damaged area.

34:19.164 --> 34:21.484
The idea is that they build
a nano-fiber trellis

34:21.636 --> 34:23.831
in the space between the torn axons.

34:24.303 --> 34:26.935
And along with the peptides,
we also inject growth factors,

34:27.119 --> 34:29.324
which help encourage nerve growth.

34:29.476 --> 34:30.858
And the nerve rebuilds itself

34:31.056 --> 34:33.181
using the nano-trellis as support.

34:34.902 --> 34:37.693
- Optic nerve regeneration.
- Am I a candidate?

34:38.605 --> 34:40.878
Well, let's start by saying that...

34:41.030 --> 34:42.688
we have never performed a human trial.

34:42.849 --> 34:44.754
But you're ready to proceed
to human trials.

34:46.023 --> 34:49.303
Well, let's see here.
You do have severe glaucoma, right?

34:50.911 --> 34:53.056
You've been on a regimen
of miotic eye drops.

34:53.208 --> 34:54.931
You have 30% of your vision

34:56.005 --> 34:58.225
and that situation seems sustainable.

34:58.375 --> 35:00.773
I mean, it's an imperfect universe, but

35:00.925 --> 35:03.507
- we learn to cope.
- I have no peripheral vision.

35:03.671 --> 35:05.903
In dim light conditions,
I'm virtually blind.

35:06.555 --> 35:09.054
But your situation is manageable.
You stay on your meds,

35:09.218 --> 35:11.150
- you won't go totally blind.
- Yeah, but...

35:11.541 --> 35:12.622
let's just say Bob

35:12.772 --> 35:15.442
had these nanotrellises
inserted tomorrow.

35:15.606 --> 35:18.582
- What's the worst-case scenario?
- You're asking me to speculate.

35:19.164 --> 35:20.209
Try it. It's fun.

35:22.641 --> 35:24.033
Okay, well...

35:24.899 --> 35:28.434
In our work with hamsters,
we have had an 85% success rate.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.422
However,

35:30.626 --> 35:33.561
when the procedure fails,
our test subjects are left

35:33.711 --> 35:34.804
totally blind.

35:36.759 --> 35:38.488
So, how do we proceed?

35:40.914 --> 35:44.400
Well, on your end, you're gonna have
to decide whether you're willing to risk

35:44.622 --> 35:46.602
- total blindness.
- And at your end?

35:46.786 --> 35:50.072
I have to consult with our backers to
make sure we're ready for human trial.

35:51.132 --> 35:53.701
I'd be more than happy to meet them,
discuss the situation.

35:53.937 --> 35:54.940
I'll set it up.

36:36.562 --> 36:38.662
<i>Marking his territory.
This specimen could go...</i>

36:39.513 --> 36:40.748
<i>I don't know, 600 pounds.</i>

36:47.272 --> 36:49.156
<i>Alright, this guy here...</i>

36:49.334 --> 36:52.051
<i>is bear 4-7-7-A's living room.</i>

36:52.438 --> 36:55.262
<i>We are gonna bait him in... tonight.</i>

36:58.542 --> 37:02.487
<i>Hey, I thought that...
camera was for scientific purposes only.</i>

37:02.637 --> 37:03.479
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

37:03.862 --> 37:05.981
<i>- Fuck off. Turn that thing off.
- No.</i>

37:07.439 --> 37:09.864
<i>That's it. Keep it coming, baby.</i>

37:11.350 --> 37:12.517
<i>What's that?</i>

37:14.927 --> 37:16.538
<i>Get the pepper spray! Oh.</i>

37:46.371 --> 37:47.375
Hello.

38:11.848 --> 38:13.983
- Hey, you got a minute?
- I do.

38:14.168 --> 38:16.441
I did some digging into Robbie McCain...

38:23.841 --> 38:24.977
- Molly!
- Uncle Wes.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.264
Hey kid.

38:29.588 --> 38:31.021
Still not feeling well?

38:31.697 --> 38:32.721
No.

38:33.468 --> 38:34.903
And they couldn't find my Dad.

38:35.181 --> 38:36.184
So...

38:36.932 --> 38:39.783
- I asked them to bring me here.
- You did the right thing.

38:39.935 --> 38:41.355
It's good to see you.

38:41.753 --> 38:43.036
Still feeling sick?

38:44.198 --> 38:46.127
I've been barfing a lot, lately.

38:48.420 --> 38:50.005
Okay. You know what...

38:51.625 --> 38:52.692
We...

38:53.157 --> 38:55.084
are gonna go back to my place.

38:55.398 --> 38:58.010
Get a movie for you.
And I will try and find your Dad.

38:58.599 --> 39:01.597
And if I can't get him, and you're still
not well, we'll go see a doctor.

39:03.297 --> 39:05.244
- Let's go.
- Thanks, Uncle Wes.

39:19.162 --> 39:21.405
I did some digging into Robbie McCain.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.015
- What you got?
- Robbie McCain.

39:23.179 --> 39:25.781
Born 1967, Pontiac, Michigan.

39:25.931 --> 39:29.541
Graduated MIT, 1987.
3.6 grade point average.

39:29.704 --> 39:31.418
- Three-point-six?
- Yeah.

39:31.570 --> 39:34.630
Doesn't sound like the grades of a guy
who single-handedly built smallpox.

39:34.883 --> 39:35.723
No.

39:35.883 --> 39:37.763
- There's more.
- Like what?

39:38.128 --> 39:41.374
He never really held a position
of any consequence, anywhere.

39:41.560 --> 39:42.912
Mostly worked as a lab tech.

39:43.062 --> 39:45.474
From all accounts,
a good, solid technician.

39:45.625 --> 39:47.456
What about when he was at DARPA?

39:47.840 --> 39:49.568
He was a project analyst.

39:50.510 --> 39:52.743
Yeah, 1993 to 2000.

39:52.894 --> 39:55.400
He's been in the BYU Zoology Department
ever since.

39:55.640 --> 39:58.737
Zoology? He wouldn't have had
any access to Level 3 containment.

39:58.943 --> 40:00.489
No cell culture hoods,

40:00.641 --> 40:03.758
no PCR machines,
no gel electrophoresis rig, David.

40:03.917 --> 40:06.290
- He couldn't have built smallpox there.
- Just a regular,

40:06.474 --> 40:08.469
by-the-book scientist,
working in a zoology lab.

40:08.619 --> 40:10.740
Yep. Family man. Close to his wife.

40:10.890 --> 40:13.060
Doesn't seem the guy
who takes the world hostage.

40:14.026 --> 40:15.971
So there had to be another facility,
right?

40:16.121 --> 40:17.182
And help?

40:17.691 --> 40:19.450
- Shit.
- Take that.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.939
- Yeah, thanks, Mayko.
- No worries.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.203
Carl, we have a situation.

40:36.824 --> 40:41.015
- Can it wait? I'm sort of busy.
- I'm sorry about what happened to Craig

40:41.281 --> 40:43.686
but sometimes the job can't wait
for our personal problems.

40:43.850 --> 40:45.239
Alright. What is it?

40:45.836 --> 40:48.305
- Robbie McCain.
<i>- What about him?</i>

40:48.741 --> 40:50.865
He didn't work for DARPA
and he didn't work alone.

40:51.050 --> 40:52.813
Means there are others
he was working with,

40:52.973 --> 40:55.532
and who the fuck knows
what they're gonna do with the smallpox.

40:55.682 --> 40:57.269
<i>Let it go, David.</i>

40:58.455 --> 41:00.757
We're talking about smallpox here.

41:04.410 --> 41:05.414
Okay,

41:05.588 --> 41:07.625
Robbie McCain did work for DARPA.

41:07.797 --> 41:10.726
<i>No, he didn't.
He worked in a zoology lab.</i>

41:13.298 --> 41:14.699
That was his cover.

41:14.858 --> 41:17.608
None of his lab co-workers actually knew
what he was working on.

41:17.918 --> 41:19.524
What was he working on?

41:20.348 --> 41:21.745
He was part of a team.

41:21.970 --> 41:24.343
They were trying to establish
if terrorists could...

41:24.507 --> 41:26.803
build a smallpox virus
using the Internet.

41:26.964 --> 41:29.990
The United States government
was building smallpox?

41:30.565 --> 41:32.539
He was one of the technicians
on the project.

41:32.767 --> 41:35.885
Apparently, after his wife's death,
he jumped the other side of the fence.

41:36.106 --> 41:38.236
<i>- With a couple of samples.</i>
- Yeah.

41:38.481 --> 41:41.499
Two. One for you
and one for Grand Central Station.

41:41.658 --> 41:43.530
How long have you known about this?

41:43.714 --> 41:44.984
<i>I just found out.</i>

41:45.221 --> 41:47.164
Well, why the fuck
didn't anybody tell us?!

41:47.615 --> 41:51.099
Look, David, DARPA is so top secret
that even I didn't know about it.

41:51.251 --> 41:53.981
Let me guess:
it was an issue of national security.

41:54.166 --> 41:56.500
He was also gonna take it public
along with you.

41:56.664 --> 41:58.982
A <i>Scopes Monkey Trial</i> for the ages.

41:59.374 --> 42:00.685
So you shot him.

42:01.156 --> 42:02.678
<i>No, they told him to stop.</i>

42:02.903 --> 42:05.739
<i>- He chose to run.</i>
- Oh, this is such bullshit!

42:05.962 --> 42:09.505
You know, I have absolutely no interest
in debating this with you any further.

42:09.707 --> 42:12.204
I've got more important things
to look after.

42:13.617 --> 42:14.620
Oh fuck!

42:24.064 --> 42:25.989
I want to be arrested and tried.

42:26.678 --> 42:29.596
But the real trial, see,
will be the state of science.

42:29.907 --> 42:32.425
A <i>Scopes Monkey trial</i> for the ages, eh?

42:38.409 --> 42:40.195
Fucker heard my conversation.

43:12.586 --> 43:14.981
I know you're here somewhere,
motherfucker.

43:16.046 --> 43:17.910
I know you're here somewhere.

43:19.131 --> 43:20.569
Hey, Eliot, it's Wes.

43:20.952 --> 43:23.029
We're at the doctor's right now.

43:24.109 --> 43:26.300
It might be just a flu, I don't know.

43:27.003 --> 43:30.216
Get back to us when you can.
Molly could really use you right now.

43:44.255 --> 43:45.678
What is it? Is she okay?

43:45.833 --> 43:47.205
Oh, she's fine, Wes.

43:47.424 --> 43:48.743
A healthy little girl.

43:49.473 --> 43:50.831
Then what is it?

43:51.888 --> 43:53.513
Are her mom and dad here with you?

43:54.662 --> 43:55.662
No, uh...

43:56.347 --> 43:58.700
I haven't been able
to get in touch with them.

43:59.002 --> 44:02.795
Look, my brother's gone through
some really rough times. And...

44:04.246 --> 44:05.984
Molly spent time with me growing up.

44:08.205 --> 44:09.205
Wes...

44:10.790 --> 44:12.074
Your niece is pregnant.

44:18.672 --> 44:21.345
- She's twelve.
- I know.

44:22.052 --> 44:23.834
And she's 11 weeks pregnant.

45:02.290 --> 45:04.417
There you are, you son of a bitch.

45:08.056 --> 45:09.297
Molly's pregnant.

45:09.639 --> 45:11.258
What about the virgin birth?

45:11.664 --> 45:13.426
That's a story in the Bible.

45:13.849 --> 45:15.220
I'm having God's baby.

45:16.041 --> 45:18.754
<i>It's as though animals are learning
an aggressive behaviour.</i>

45:19.028 --> 45:20.517
<i>They're becoming better killers.</i>

45:20.677 --> 45:21.680
That's my son!

45:22.145 --> 45:25.217
Just in case you don't recognize him
with half his face falling off!

45:25.367 --> 45:28.150
And that's what's left of his partner,
Tom. Okay?

45:28.582 --> 45:30.057
He wasn't my friend,

45:30.589 --> 45:31.720
Dad. He was...

45:33.575 --> 45:34.578
my lover.

45:35.801 --> 45:36.804
Now he's dead.

45:36.954 --> 45:39.589
Dr. Sandstr√∂m, I'd like to introduce you
to Titus Myerbridge

45:39.767 --> 45:41.999
from Auflander Docheimer Industries.

45:43.269 --> 45:45.250
- Yeah.
<i>- Anyway, David has it all set up.</i>

45:45.638 --> 45:46.960
That nano-trellis procedure.

45:47.112 --> 45:50.046
- You're gonna go through with that?
- Mayko, I want my eyesight back.

45:50.198 --> 45:52.382
- David doesn't see any alternative.
- David.

45:53.664 --> 45:55.510
If you don't want to go
through with this...

45:55.834 --> 45:57.512
You just say the word and we'll cancel.

45:59.089 --> 46:00.224
But I have to.
