to us in school.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.193
There was this hungry stranger
that came to a village.

08:04.276 --> 08:07.613
But he didn't have anything to trade
for food except for a big rock.

08:09.323 --> 08:13.160
So he convinced all the villagers
to try his world-famous Stone Soup.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.205
But before that, he tells one person,

08:16.538 --> 08:18.498
"Hey, I'm gonna have to borrow some salt."

08:18.916 --> 08:20.292
Then he tells another person,

08:20.417 --> 08:21.877
"Just gonna need a little bit of onion."

from everyone in the village

08:28.300 --> 08:29.801
until he has a real soup.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.513
And everyone's happy.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.141

Maybe Ezekiel and the others
will bring help soon,

08:40.729 --> 08:42.523

a soup out of rocks.

I just noticed that
Daryl didn't come back with you.

38:01.198 --> 38:02.741
Two plus two equals eureka, you know.

38:06.245 --> 38:07.829
What if you really are broken?

38:09.122 --> 38:12.543
What if your best friend
just realized it a whole lot later

38:12.626 --> 38:13.794
than everyone else did?

38:16.088 --> 38:18.549
Ezekiel probably has a saying
for that, too.

38:19.049 --> 38:20.717
I just don't know what it is.

38:22.427 --> 38:23.554
What would you say?

38:40.279 --> 38:44.867
-Was that...
-Yeah. Yeah.

38:48.996 --> 38:51.707
Why don't you come on in?
Soup's almost ready.

38:54.501 --> 38:58.755
<i>You made your bed</i>
<i>Now just sleep in it</i>

38:58.839 --> 39:01.300
<i>And dreams will cut the words out</i>

39:01.383 --> 39:05.804
<i>I grind my teeth</i>
<i>Grind my teeth to chalk</i>

39:05.888 --> 39:08.098
<i>Finding words to say to you</i>

39:15.439 --> 39:17.107
<i>Any fool</i>

39:17.191 --> 39:22.446
<i>Fool can carry on</i>
<i>with grand delusions</i>

39:22.613 --> 39:26.158
<i>Any dog</i>
<i>Dog like me could find</i>

39:26.241 --> 39:27.242
Sorry.

39:27.367 --> 39:29.453
<i>The best way through the fence</i>

39:29.536 --> 39:33.248
<i>You just don’t think about the time</i>

39:36.627 --> 39:37.753
(CHUCKLES)

39:43.258 --> 39:44.343
What the hell happened to you?

39:44.801 --> 39:46.428
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

39:48.347 --> 39:49.848
You know, the usual.

39:51.683 --> 39:53.519
Yeah, same.

39:55.437 --> 39:58.023
-Find anything?
-Yeah, yeah.

39:59.983 --> 40:01.151
How was he? Was he good?

40:03.820 --> 40:04.988
He was.

40:07.449 --> 40:09.868
You hungry? I made some soup for everyone.

40:10.369 --> 40:12.538
No, I'm all right. Thank you though.

40:13.956 --> 40:15.123
Yeah, sure.

40:18.168 --> 40:19.461
Oh, um...

40:21.839 --> 40:23.298
Forgot to give this back to you.

40:25.217 --> 40:26.260
You can keep it.

40:27.511 --> 40:28.512
Really?

40:36.728 --> 40:40.065
I'm kinda beat.
I'm gonna hit the sack, all right?

40:40.983 --> 40:42.025
Yeah, me, too.

40:42.192 --> 40:43.485
Come on.

41:08.135 --> 41:10.137
