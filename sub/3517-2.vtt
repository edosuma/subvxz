00:15.317 --> 00:19.529
<i>This is not the most inspiring
choice for vice president, right?</i>

00:19.571 --> 00:22.866
<i>A well-respected operator,</i>
<i>pragmatic, but let's face it,</i>

00:22.866 --> 00:25.785
<i>this is probably just a nod
to Congress, tapping one of their own.</i>

00:25.785 --> 00:30.290
<i>It's really nothing more than
a placeholder until 2016, assuredly.</i>

00:30.290 --> 00:32.750
<i>I'm not surprised he's doing</i>
<i>a private swearing-in.</i>

00:32.750 --> 00:35.712
<i>My bet is the president wants to draw
as little attention to this as possible.</i>

00:35.712 --> 00:38.506
<i>There's just</i>
<i>no real wow factor...</i>

00:44.220 --> 00:46.181
Christina's working out well?

00:46.181 --> 00:48.767
She's getting her sea legs, but
I've been happy so far.

00:48.767 --> 00:50.852
- She works hard.
- It's a big load off my shoulders

00:50.852 --> 00:53.313
when she can travel with the
president instead of me.

00:53.313 --> 00:56.316
I get so much more done
when I stay here.

00:57.984 --> 01:00.195
President have a preference
in the whip's race?

01:00.195 --> 01:02.030
I can't believe how ugly
it's gotten.

01:02.030 --> 01:03.823
He was more disappointed
than anything else...

01:03.823 --> 01:06.618
- Watch out, Wes.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

01:06.618 --> 01:08.578
- Not at all.
- This is something else.

01:08.578 --> 01:10.705
Security specs. They had
to work fast. Watch yourself.

01:10.705 --> 01:12.457
It's like a war zone
around here.

01:12.457 --> 01:14.626
The idea is to keep
the war from getting in.

01:14.626 --> 01:16.586
How's the whip's race coming,
Congressman?

01:16.586 --> 01:18.046
It's tight between
you and Howard?

01:18.046 --> 01:19.506
Well, you'd have to ask Howard,

01:19.506 --> 01:21.716
if he's not too busy
trying to sodomize me.

01:21.716 --> 01:24.719
- Should we go say hello? - For God sakes,
don't make me talk to that man.

01:26.930 --> 01:31.476
- Good to see you, Howard.
- Nice to see you, Wes.

01:31.476 --> 01:34.479
Yeah, I bet it is.

01:46.950 --> 01:48.785
- Bob.
- Frank.

01:48.785 --> 01:50.453
- Thanks for inviting me, Frank.
- What?

01:50.453 --> 01:52.288
- Thanks for inviting me.
- You bet.

01:52.288 --> 01:57.752
- Hey, Frank.
- Judge! Good to see you.

01:57.752 --> 02:00.588
- Is there somewhere I can go to change?
- Yes, absolutely.

02:00.588 --> 02:03.341
There's room down the hall.
Doug, will you take care of the judge?

02:03.341 --> 02:05.468
And when he's ready,
let's get this thing over with.

02:05.468 --> 02:07.095
I'll start bringing 'em in.

02:07.095 --> 02:09.097
"That I take this
obligation freely,

02:09.097 --> 02:12.600
without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion..."

02:12.600 --> 02:14.394
That I take
this obligation freely,

02:14.394 --> 02:16.730
without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion...

02:16.730 --> 02:18.231
"...and that I will..."

02:18.231 --> 02:19.899
One heartbeat away
from the presidency,

02:19.899 --> 02:22.235
and not a single
vote cast in my name.

02:22.235 --> 02:26.072
- Democracy is so overrated.
- "...on which I am about to enter,

02:26.072 --> 02:29.117
- so help me God."
- ...and that I will well and faithfully

02:29.117 --> 02:34.456
discharge the duties of the office on
which I am about to enter, so help me God.

02:34.456 --> 02:38.501
- Congratulations,
Mr. Vice President.

02:49.387 --> 02:52.265
All right, let's get back
to running the country.

02:52.307 --> 04:27.110

04:27.152 --> 04:29.487
Now, one of you is
gonna replace me as the whip.

04:29.487 --> 04:31.865
You're the two frontrunners
and we know you both want it.

04:31.865 --> 04:34.159
You're not behaving
like men who belong in the leadership.

04:34.159 --> 04:36.578
We need to tone
down the rhetoric.

04:36.578 --> 04:38.955
- You're hurting the party.
- I'm just responding

04:38.955 --> 04:40.498
to the lies Howard's
been slinging.

04:40.498 --> 04:42.792
Those junkets happened, Wes.
I'm not making it up.

04:42.792 --> 04:45.170
- And nepotism's any better?
- That's just not true and you know it.

04:45.170 --> 04:47.589
Your sister's husband happened
to be appointed state treasurer?

04:47.589 --> 04:49.174
Ex-husband. And yes.

04:49.174 --> 04:50.925
That is such
a load of crap, Howard.

04:50.925 --> 04:52.886
Gentlemen, Bob is right.

04:52.886 --> 04:55.013
This sort of catfighting
gets out in the press,

04:55.013 --> 04:57.807
whichever one of you wins
hits the ground limping.

04:57.807 --> 05:03.271
Let's keep it clean and bring some civility
back to the House. Can we agree to that?

05:06.358 --> 05:08.276
I'd feel a lot better
if you shook hands on it.

05:14.908 --> 05:16.951
Thank you.

05:23.750 --> 05:26.044
I'm with him right now,
Christina.

05:26.044 --> 05:28.213
I'm off. I'll swing
by your office later.

05:28.213 --> 05:30.840
Don't. It's not ready yet.
I'll be working from here.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.134
- What?
- Tusk is in town.

05:33.134 --> 05:35.553
He's meeting with the president
in 45 minutes. Christina just told me.

05:35.553 --> 05:37.889
- The Joint Commission talks.
- That's what she said.

05:37.889 --> 05:40.350
- Christina's proving useful.
- We'll stay in touch.

05:40.350 --> 05:42.978
Get me Cathy Durant.
Your people coming by?

05:42.978 --> 05:46.481
Just my new chief of staff.
That's all I've got until we hire more.

05:46.481 --> 05:50.068
So how's it feel to be married
to the vice president?

05:50.068 --> 05:53.822
Exactly
the same... just louder.

05:53.822 --> 05:56.032
Secretary Durant.

05:56.032 --> 05:57.200
Cathy.

05:59.995 --> 06:01.746
Raymond.

06:03.498 --> 06:05.917
Congratulations,
Mr. Vice President.

06:05.917 --> 06:10.380
Thank you very much.
May I please introduce Secretary Durant.

06:10.380 --> 06:14.009
- A pleasure, Madame Secretary.
- Hi.

06:14.009 --> 06:18.847
Well, this is quite a surprise.
I had no idea you were in town.

06:18.847 --> 06:21.266
Ah...

06:21.266 --> 06:23.018
Well...

06:38.325 --> 06:40.493
Morning, sir.

06:40.493 --> 06:42.746
- Mr. President.
- Catherine.

06:42.746 --> 06:46.207
- We just happened to run into Raymond.
- Huh!

06:46.207 --> 06:49.502
Wonderful. Come on in.

06:51.963 --> 06:54.257
The phone records will
absolutely prove I'm right.

06:54.257 --> 06:55.925
There were no phone records.
You know that.

06:55.925 --> 06:57.802
The data history,
with the carrier.

06:57.802 --> 06:59.929
Even if we got the case reopened,
which isn't gonna happen,

06:59.929 --> 07:03.141
you have any idea how hard it
is to get a warrant for phone data?

07:03.141 --> 07:05.810
Probable cause.
Bring him in for questioning.

07:05.810 --> 07:08.605
- Technically, you have jurisdiction.
- The vice president?

07:08.605 --> 07:11.691
I know this all sounds preposterous
to you, but if you go through my notes...

07:11.691 --> 07:15.070
- We've been through your notes.
- You've listened, but you haven't heard me.

07:15.070 --> 07:17.906
Circumstantial,
yes, but plausible.

07:17.906 --> 07:21.201
I know you've
reopened cases on less.

07:21.201 --> 07:24.704
This has gotta stop, man.
We keep having the same conversation.

07:24.704 --> 07:26.873
It can't be an accident.

07:29.876 --> 07:35.465
OK, I'm gonna
show you something.

07:35.465 --> 07:40.512
CNN tried to get ahold of this,
we 86'd it out of respect to the family.

07:40.512 --> 07:42.430
The footage?

07:46.184 --> 07:49.688
- It's not easy to watch.
- I want to see it.

07:54.442 --> 07:58.321
She tripped, or jumped.

08:00.615 --> 08:02.701
She didn't jump.

08:06.997 --> 08:09.124
Here it is, frame by frame.

08:24.222 --> 08:28.601
Now, there were two witnesses.
One was a 70-year-old woman
with macular degeneration.

08:28.601 --> 08:31.313
All she saw was a blur.
The second was the conductor of the train.

08:31.313 --> 08:34.357
He said it looked like she fell.
Between those two and this video,

08:34.357 --> 08:37.193
that's all there is.

08:37.193 --> 08:43.658
You can watch it a million
times, but this case is closed.

08:43.658 --> 08:46.995
We should limit the agenda
to a couple of key issues:

08:46.995 --> 08:50.373
import tariffs on industrial
manufactured goods,

08:50.373 --> 08:53.585
and export quotas
on rare earth elements.

08:53.585 --> 08:56.171
They're using both
as political levers.

08:56.171 --> 08:59.132
I agree these are two areas where we can
make meaningful progress.

08:59.132 --> 09:02.052
But I'm worried about the rise
in corporate cyberattacks.

09:02.052 --> 09:06.765
- That's a rabbit hole.
- We have to address it sooner or later.

09:06.765 --> 09:09.225
It's just a matter of whether
we want to address it now.

09:09.225 --> 09:14.356
Chinese don't like surprises.
All I'm proposing is that we
use the Joint Commission talks

09:14.356 --> 09:17.317
to bring it up gently now,
set the stage for the next round.

09:17.317 --> 09:19.194
Look, I'm a businessman,
not a diplomat.

09:19.194 --> 09:23.531
But I'm a businessman with
35 years' experience working in China.

09:23.531 --> 09:25.867
When they come to the table,
you don't get greedy.

09:25.867 --> 09:28.745
You're working on a co-venture
refinery project in Fujian.

09:28.745 --> 09:30.789
Which would be
the first of its kind.

09:30.789 --> 09:33.833
Open the gateway
for increased investment...

09:33.833 --> 09:36.503
Cyberattacks
threaten those co-ventures.

09:36.503 --> 09:40.090
There's less a need for them
if the Chinese can obtain new technology

09:40.090 --> 09:42.676
- from corporate espionage.
- Frank, what do you think?

09:42.676 --> 09:44.594
I lean more toward
Raymond's thinking.

09:44.594 --> 09:47.681
If we antagonize the Chinese,
we could undo years of progress.

09:47.681 --> 09:52.435
Allow me to do this quietly, with a
soft touch. I won't antagonize them, sir.

09:52.435 --> 09:54.813
The last thing we want to do
is rock the boat.

09:54.813 --> 09:56.356
What do you have
in mind, Catherine?

09:56.356 --> 09:59.609
A suggested agenda,
not a demand.

09:59.609 --> 10:03.613
We'll keep it mid-level.
I won't get anywhere near it.

10:03.613 --> 10:07.033
- Raymond?
- I've voiced my concerns.

10:10.954 --> 10:14.082
- A very soft touch.
- You have my word, sir.

10:14.082 --> 10:15.750
Good.

10:17.460 --> 10:20.964
Raymond, you want
to grab some lunch?

10:22.132 --> 10:24.551
- Would love to.
- Thanks, Frank.

10:24.551 --> 10:28.096
- Welcome to the West Wing.
- Thank you, sir.

10:34.060 --> 10:37.647
The president is like a lone
tree in an empty field.

10:37.647 --> 10:39.941
He leans whichever way
the wind is blowing.

10:39.941 --> 10:44.571
And right now, Raymond Tusk
blows far too strong from the West.

10:44.571 --> 10:46.906
- Is that a wig?
- No.

10:46.906 --> 10:50.201
- He's been growing it out for months.
- Here, this way.

10:50.201 --> 10:52.871
Diane says she likes it long.

10:52.871 --> 10:58.460
I told her she'll feel differently
once she sees the first dreadlock or...

10:58.460 --> 11:00.503
- ...smells it.
- Oh!

11:02.881 --> 11:05.050
I went to see your
daughter last weekend.

11:07.636 --> 11:09.888
- How is she?
- You want to see a picture?

11:09.888 --> 11:12.057
OK.

11:13.975 --> 11:16.561
- Was her mother there?
- Yeah.

11:17.479 --> 11:19.022
Are they OK on money?

11:19.022 --> 11:21.358
The rate at Greenwoods
is going up in January.

11:21.358 --> 11:24.653
Catalina's worried
she's gonna be short.

11:24.653 --> 11:27.030
I'll make sure to put
more into the account.

11:27.030 --> 11:28.907
We don't have to talk
about her if you don't want.

11:28.907 --> 11:32.535
No, no, no, it's fine.
I appreciate you going to see her.

11:32.535 --> 11:35.246
I'm sorry, Ted, I thought that
when you asked me to lunch,

11:35.246 --> 11:38.833
- it was because you...
- No, no, no. I mean... yes.

11:38.833 --> 11:43.630
I want to make sure they
have what they need. But no.

11:43.630 --> 11:47.717
The reason I wanted to talk...

11:49.219 --> 11:52.514
- Lorrie Tate.
- Lorrie's a friend of mine.

11:52.514 --> 11:54.683
What about her?

11:54.683 --> 11:57.936
She mentioned you were
interested in the whip's race.

11:57.936 --> 12:01.815
Oh, no.
Oh, I wish she hadn't.

12:01.815 --> 12:05.944
- Why not?
- Because it's ridiculous.

12:05.944 --> 12:07.445
Is it?

12:10.490 --> 12:12.617
I just mentioned it offhand.

12:12.617 --> 12:15.370
The whole Webb and Buchwalter
thing, it's just...

12:15.370 --> 12:18.081
- Complete mess.
- But I wasn't serious.

12:18.081 --> 12:21.668
I think you should be serious.
Do you want to do it?

12:21.668 --> 12:24.004
I don't have the experience,
Ted. And I don't...

12:24.004 --> 12:26.881
- Yes or no?
- Yes, of course.

12:26.881 --> 12:30.802
Someday. But now?
I don't have the money they do.

12:30.802 --> 12:34.431
- Unless you use mine.
- You can't waste your money on...

12:34.431 --> 12:38.435
If I funnel my PAC money
to some folks who are on the fence,

12:38.435 --> 12:41.604
round up a couple dozen
commitments before you announce,

12:41.604 --> 12:46.860
that would make you an instant contender.
Now, tell me that's a waste.

12:46.860 --> 12:48.987
We're talking
hundreds of thousands.

12:48.987 --> 12:51.489
It's not a Christmas present,
Jackie.

12:51.489 --> 12:54.409
With you as whip, I have
a strong ally in the leadership.

12:54.409 --> 13:00.040
I stand to gain as much as you.
Now, hang on one second.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.709
I don't know where the...

13:04.794 --> 13:06.504
<i>How did it go?</i>
<i>Did he buy it?</i>

13:06.504 --> 13:09.758
Whatever bug you put in his ear,
it burrowed deep.

13:09.758 --> 13:12.510
It was easy. The man adores
you like you're his own child.

13:12.510 --> 13:15.305
But you sure as hell better
make me chief deputy.

13:15.305 --> 13:19.768
- I need to win first.
- Ted and I make two, 111 to go.

13:19.768 --> 13:22.520
It's always good when the chief deputy
knows her arithmetic.

13:22.520 --> 13:25.315
Fuck off.
Let's start taking names.

13:25.315 --> 13:29.527
- This one seems promising.
- Connor Ellis. He's solid.

13:29.527 --> 13:33.198
- Good experience. - He's the one that
got Senator Jones out of that mess

13:33.198 --> 13:36.701
- with the push-polling.
- Yes. Kept him from the Ethics Committee.

13:36.701 --> 13:40.413
- Let's set up an interview.
- I'll find a good time in the schedule.

13:40.413 --> 13:44.501
Let's talk about the schedule.
I think we need to be...

13:44.501 --> 13:47.337
...more selective
with the events I do.

13:47.337 --> 13:51.800
Some of these are leftovers from
Mrs. Matthews. We can
cancel whatever you like.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.885
And what's this?

13:53.885 --> 13:57.138
Your husband will be pinning stars
on two newly commissioned Marine generals.

13:57.138 --> 14:00.475
- I think that's one you should do.
- OK, walk me through it.

14:00.475 --> 14:04.354
The generals are Alicia Hampton
and Dalton McGinnis.

14:04.354 --> 14:07.565
- Arriving at 6:50...
- Dalton McGinnis?

14:07.565 --> 14:09.985
Yes. Do you know him?

14:13.947 --> 14:17.409
We went to college together.

14:17.409 --> 14:20.453
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Um, arrive what time?

14:20.453 --> 14:22.414
- Six-fifty.
- Great. I'd like a list

14:22.414 --> 14:24.374
of all the people
that will be attending.

14:24.374 --> 14:27.168
It's not that big a deal
if I get left out,

14:27.168 --> 14:29.296
but you're
the secretary of state.

14:29.296 --> 14:31.715
I mean, Tusk should not
be determining policy.

14:31.715 --> 14:35.176
The president alone should
instruct you on what you are to pursue.

14:35.176 --> 14:38.388
- What's their relationship?
- He's has had his ear for years.

14:38.388 --> 14:40.807
- An advisor...
- More of a mentor.

14:40.807 --> 14:42.976
And one whose advice
is not easily dismissed.

14:42.976 --> 14:45.061
He's gonna keep pushing back
on cyberwarfare.

14:45.061 --> 14:49.232
- Not if I get it on the agenda.
- Especially if you get it on the agenda.

14:49.232 --> 14:51.109
Tusk is not gonna
take any chances

14:51.109 --> 14:53.778
when the next Joint Commission
talks come around.

14:53.778 --> 14:55.488
You agreed with him
in the meeting.

14:55.488 --> 14:58.366
If we had ganged up, he would've taken
a firmer position.

14:58.366 --> 15:02.412
For all we know, he's convincing
the president right now to change his mind.

15:02.412 --> 15:06.207
Now, we need to remove
that option as a possibility.

15:06.207 --> 15:11.588
- How? - Force the Chinese to
confront the issue now,

15:11.588 --> 15:15.008
- this round of talks.
- I promised the president a soft touch.

15:15.008 --> 15:19.304
- I can't intentionally break my promise.
- What if it was unintentional?

15:21.681 --> 15:27.312
Cathy, if you don't like how
the table is set, turn over the table.

15:31.483 --> 15:34.653
- You're cheating.
- No, I'm not. It's vapor.

15:34.653 --> 15:37.530
- Still.
- You should try it.

15:37.530 --> 15:42.952
- Addiction without the consequences.
- It's all yours.

15:42.952 --> 15:44.996
You staying up?

15:46.206 --> 15:48.500
This ceremony tomorrow night.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.419
- You don't want to go.
- If I don't have to.

15:51.419 --> 15:53.338
I hate these
sort of things, too,

15:53.338 --> 15:57.092
but it is my first public
appearance as vice president.

15:58.927 --> 16:01.763
- OK.
- Thank you.

16:06.059 --> 16:09.187
Should we turn this
into a proper office?

16:09.187 --> 16:14.067
That's not a bad idea.
No privacy downstairs.

16:14.067 --> 16:16.528
I'll talk to the contractor.

16:16.528 --> 16:19.823
- Good night, Francis.
- Good night.

16:41.052 --> 16:44.764
Sir, sir!<i> Congressional Record.</i>
Weren't the talks supposed to go until six?

16:44.764 --> 16:47.600
- We can't talk if they won't listen.
- Did the Chinese walk out?

16:47.600 --> 16:49.728
We made it clear that we won't
discuss any other issues

16:49.728 --> 16:52.522
until government-sponsored
cyberattacks are on the table.

16:52.522 --> 16:54.607
That's not what
they wanted to hear.

16:54.607 --> 16:56.901
Sir, what did you tell the Chinese
delegation before they walked out?

16:56.901 --> 17:00.238
We didn't have anybody there.
The Joint Commission's
usually a snooze fest.

17:00.238 --> 17:02.657
- Not today, it wasn't.
- I've got Greer on it.

17:02.657 --> 17:04.617
Isn't this international?

17:04.617 --> 17:06.578
We need somebody from the tech
beat if we want any background

17:06.578 --> 17:09.580
- on cyberwarfare.
- Does he have anybody on record yet?

17:09.580 --> 17:12.000
The Chinese aren't talking.
And all the US delegation said

17:12.000 --> 17:14.919
- is what's in the AP wire.
- I want something online in two hours.

17:14.919 --> 17:17.756
In-depth follow-up
sometime this week.

17:19.257 --> 17:24.596
Hey, Lucas... you all right?

17:24.596 --> 17:26.556
Yeah, why?

17:26.556 --> 17:29.893
You're wearing the same
clothes you wore yesterday.

17:29.893 --> 17:32.103
Am I?

17:32.103 --> 17:34.981
I don't know what's going on
in your personal life,

17:34.981 --> 17:38.777
but it seems to be entering the
workplace. Appearances matter.

17:38.777 --> 17:42.656
We can't have an editor looking
more disheveled than his reporters.

17:42.656 --> 17:45.408
Two hours.
You'll have something.

17:45.408 --> 17:47.494
Did you know Jackie
Sharp's running for whip?

17:47.494 --> 17:50.747
- No, it's the first I'm hearing of it.
- I spoke to Webb.

17:50.747 --> 17:54.960
He got an e-mail from Lorrie Tate about
me. I got one from Dave Holland about him.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.171
- Which means nothing to me.
- The junkets, the nepotism.

17:58.171 --> 18:01.800
Tate and Sharp are close. Holland serves
on the VA Committee with her.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.426
She used proxies
to insulate herself.

18:03.426 --> 18:05.595
You think she gave
the dirt to them.

18:05.595 --> 18:08.056
- She's been playing both of us.
- How many commitments you think

18:08.056 --> 18:10.350
- she could have?
- Around 20 so far.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.811
- So she's a distant third.
- But she's picking people off us

18:12.811 --> 18:15.939
- left and right. I want your help.
- You have my support, Wes.

18:15.939 --> 18:20.151
- Then make that public. - If I come out
for you, Birch comes out for Webb.

18:20.151 --> 18:22.696
- That's gonna hurt you, not help you.
- This is serious, Frank.

18:22.696 --> 18:24.990
Ted Havemeyer
is bankrolling her.

18:24.990 --> 18:26.908
- Have you thought of talking to Jackie?
- No, no.

18:26.908 --> 18:29.828
- I can't do that on principle.
- Why not?

18:29.828 --> 18:32.956
Anyone who Havemeyer is backing,
I don't work with.

18:32.956 --> 18:35.041
He pulled this same crap on me
when I ran for Senate.

18:35.041 --> 18:37.627
He financed my primary opponent.
Asshole.

18:37.627 --> 18:40.255
Well, that is your call.
But if you're gonna let an old grudge

18:40.255 --> 18:42.590
- get in the way of progress...
- I just can't do it, Frank.

18:42.590 --> 18:45.218
Havemeyer's been trying to shove
me down the totem pole for years.

18:45.218 --> 18:47.137
I won't give him
the satisfaction.

18:47.137 --> 18:50.640
Well, I can respect that,
but my hands are tied.

18:50.640 --> 18:54.311
It's a delicate matter, but we are in
communication with the Chinese government

18:54.311 --> 18:56.604
- as to how to move forward.
- This mean the US will back down

18:56.604 --> 18:58.940
- on cyberattacks?
- The United States never backs down,

18:58.940 --> 19:02.027
particularly on issues
that are high priority to us.

19:02.027 --> 19:06.448
Madame Secretary, what did you
tell the head of the delegation?

19:09.784 --> 19:11.828
The delegation
overstepped its bounds.

19:11.828 --> 19:14.205
But Cathy couldn't throw her
own people under the bus.

19:14.205 --> 19:16.833
She should've consulted
us first before speaking publicly.

19:16.833 --> 19:19.669
The press was on her doorstep and
the president was in another hemisphere.

19:19.669 --> 19:23.173
Look, I'm not condoning
what she did, but she had to do something.

19:23.173 --> 19:25.717
She made a gut call
and she acted.

19:25.717 --> 19:27.344
We have to distance
ourselves from this.

19:27.344 --> 19:29.471
- When is the president back?
- Tomorrow morning.

19:29.471 --> 19:30.805
Can we set up a meeting?

19:30.805 --> 19:32.599
Cathy needs
to publicly apologize.

19:32.599 --> 19:34.267
We get her in the room
with the president?

19:34.267 --> 19:36.394
Shouldn't we all be
on the same page first?

19:36.394 --> 19:38.355
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

19:38.355 --> 19:40.815
Now, you asked me a question
before I went and got my food

19:40.815 --> 19:43.735
- and I've forgotten what...
- Mr. Vice President. General McGinnis.

19:43.735 --> 19:47.072
Ah. It's a great honor. I hope
you don't mind, the president
wishes he could be here.

19:47.072 --> 19:49.199
- He's asked me to fill in.
- The honor is mine, sir.

19:49.199 --> 19:53.286
- And, General, this is my wife Claire.
- It's good to see you, Claire.

19:53.286 --> 19:55.538
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

19:55.538 --> 19:58.416
- Harvard. We were classmates.
- Claire didn't say a thing.

19:58.416 --> 20:03.088
We dated for a time.
Well, about five minutes.

20:03.088 --> 20:05.090
Anyway, I'll let you
get back to your meal.

20:05.090 --> 20:07.509
Thank you. I've remembered.

20:07.509 --> 20:11.846
Interestingly enough, in South Carolinam,
the largest crop is not cotton.

20:11.846 --> 20:16.601
No. It's tobacco.
And the third largest crop is marijuana.

20:16.601 --> 20:18.478
Now...

20:18.478 --> 20:20.730
We'll just keep
that to ourselves.

20:20.730 --> 20:22.899
Would you all excuse me
for just a moment?

20:23.984 --> 20:25.610
- Is she alone?
- Yes.

20:25.610 --> 20:28.029
Will you give us
a few moments, please.

20:32.993 --> 20:34.953
What's wrong?

20:36.788 --> 20:40.625
- It was him.
- Who?

20:42.585 --> 20:44.754
Freshman year.

20:47.299 --> 20:49.217
You mean...?

20:50.593 --> 20:53.430
McGinnis?

20:53.430 --> 20:55.098
Francis. Francis!

20:55.098 --> 20:58.059
Please, don't do anything,
please!

20:58.059 --> 20:59.936
I am not gonna pin
a medal on that man.

20:59.936 --> 21:01.688
- You have to!
- Just a minute, please!

21:01.688 --> 21:03.857
- There is no way...
- They want to start.

21:03.857 --> 21:05.900
Just a minute, please!
He does not deserve a medal.

21:05.900 --> 21:08.737
- That man needs to be taken out and shot!
- I am begging you. Please!

21:08.737 --> 21:12.741
- No! I said just a minute!
- Do not make a scene!

21:12.741 --> 21:14.784
Please!

21:45.607 --> 21:48.485
Tom.

21:48.485 --> 21:50.612
Thanks for coming by.

21:54.032 --> 21:58.995
You know, I thought I would miss
this place the moment I stepped inside...

22:00.121 --> 22:02.248
...but I don't.

22:05.085 --> 22:07.087
Hope you like Stella.

22:13.551 --> 22:16.054
- Cheers.
- Here's how.

22:23.395 --> 22:27.732
- How are things?
- Ah! They're good.

22:29.192 --> 22:31.111
They're good.

22:33.154 --> 22:36.658
- You're happy?
- I haven't been happy a day in my life.

22:36.658 --> 22:41.538
But I have time now.
To think. To write.

22:41.538 --> 22:44.624
- Been working on a novel.
- Yeah?

22:44.624 --> 22:48.837
Mm. It's absolute shit,
but that's OK.

22:48.837 --> 22:51.923
That's great, Tom.
That's really great.

22:51.923 --> 22:56.428
What's on your mind? I know you
didn't ask me here just to catch up.

23:11.943 --> 23:13.903
Frank Underwood.

23:13.903 --> 23:16.448
On the president's
behalf, it is my great honor

23:16.448 --> 23:18.658
to formally recognize
the selection

23:18.658 --> 23:21.870
of General Alicia Hampton
as commander,

23:21.870 --> 23:23.997
United States European Command,

23:23.997 --> 23:26.625
and General Dalton McGinnis
as commander

23:26.625 --> 23:29.169
of the United States
Strategic Command.

23:29.169 --> 23:31.546
The United States Marine Corps
has been well served

23:31.546 --> 23:36.509
by these two...
exemplary leaders.

23:36.509 --> 23:40.096
The president and I are grateful
for their continued service.

23:49.731 --> 23:52.942
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

24:32.440 --> 24:35.193
You think I'm insane?

24:35.193 --> 24:38.488
I don't think you're insane.

24:41.199 --> 24:44.995
I think you've been through a lot.
You're trying to make sense of it all.

24:44.995 --> 24:48.999
- I know I'm right.
- I'm sure you believe you are.

24:48.999 --> 24:51.418
It's a fact that he helped
cover up the DUI.

24:51.418 --> 24:56.673
Imagine if one of your reporters
came to you with this story.

24:56.673 --> 24:59.301
- Could you print a word of it?
- No, but I'd have them keep digging.

24:59.301 --> 25:01.511
Would you? If you're
honest with yourself,

25:01.511 --> 25:03.763
wouldn't you tell them it
seemed far-fetched?

25:03.763 --> 25:07.017
Your notes aren't convincing.
The police reports don't prove a link.

25:07.017 --> 25:10.020
- And the speculative leaps you're making?
- I know.

25:10.020 --> 25:14.482
Hold yourself to the same
standards you hold your staff.

25:18.611 --> 25:20.238
You and Zoe
were seeing each other.

25:21.698 --> 25:24.284
I'm assuming. Maybe I'm wrong.

25:28.496 --> 25:30.582
No, we were.

25:40.425 --> 25:43.845
When I lost my first wife,
it didn't add up.

25:43.845 --> 25:47.307
Who dies of breast cancer at 31?

25:47.307 --> 25:52.354
I wanted to sue, doctors,
the hospital, everyone.

25:52.354 --> 25:55.106
I thought they were
hiding something.

25:56.566 --> 25:58.443
No.

25:58.443 --> 26:03.323
Grief demands an answer,
but sometimes there isn't one.

26:04.866 --> 26:10.163
Her life couldn't be saved.
Period.

26:11.331 --> 26:13.166
What do I do?

26:14.626 --> 26:16.962
Would you consider
seeing someone?

26:16.962 --> 26:19.464
There's a therapist who helped
me when Cynthia passed away.

26:19.464 --> 26:21.800
- I can put you in touch with...
- No, I don't need to see somebody.

26:21.800 --> 26:26.096
- Lucas.
- I appreciate you coming by, Tom.

26:27.263 --> 26:29.432
Thanks for the beer.

26:31.810 --> 26:33.478
You can call me anytime.

26:41.861 --> 26:44.489
You take care of yourself,
Lucas.

26:47.033 --> 26:48.952
I mean it.

27:00.463 --> 27:02.924
Any plans to go elsewhere, sir?

27:02.924 --> 27:04.843
No, we're in
for the night. Thank you.

27:04.843 --> 27:06.594
Yes, sir.

27:12.350 --> 27:14.144
Hey.

27:17.105 --> 27:19.190
I'm tired.

28:08.406 --> 28:10.825
Do you need something, sir?

28:10.825 --> 28:14.704
My remote, I wanna play.

28:14.704 --> 28:16.957
It's right over here.

28:19.501 --> 28:21.378
Thank you.

28:28.218 --> 28:30.512
Something wrong with the
Internet? I can't get online.

28:30.512 --> 28:34.182
We had to disable the access.
It's not a secure connection.

28:53.493 --> 28:55.578
Would you just
give me a moment, please?

28:55.578 --> 28:59.416
Whenever you're out here,
somebody needs to be with you.

28:59.416 --> 29:02.794
I can't be alone
in my own backyard?

29:02.794 --> 29:06.464
If it were up to me, sir,
but it's not up to me.

29:12.304 --> 29:14.723
OK, Meechum.

29:57.140 --> 29:59.392
You think I don't
want to smash things?

30:01.186 --> 30:05.357
I know what that anger is
more than you can imagine.

30:08.485 --> 30:11.488
- When he was on top of me...
- - We don't have to talk about it.

30:11.488 --> 30:13.782
No, I want to.

30:17.077 --> 30:20.664
When he was on top of me,
I pressed my hand...

30:23.541 --> 30:29.047
...with everything I could,
I pressed it into his face.

30:29.047 --> 30:32.634
I pressed it so hard,
I broke his nose.

30:33.468 --> 30:36.012
That didn't stop him.

30:38.223 --> 30:42.727
He shoved the sheets in my
mouth. I could barely breathe.

30:48.942 --> 30:54.197
Every time I think of her,
pinned down like that,

30:54.197 --> 31:00.245
I strangle her, Francis...
so she doesn't strangle me.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.708
I have to.

31:04.708 --> 31:06.751
We have to.

31:09.462 --> 31:12.007
The alternative is...

31:13.341 --> 31:15.635
...it's unlivable.

31:20.473 --> 31:22.976
You should go to sleep.

31:26.563 --> 31:29.858
I'm not sure if I can.

31:29.858 --> 31:32.944
Then you should
go back downstairs.

31:49.127 --> 31:52.297
You'll still feel
the hate in the morning.

31:53.381 --> 31:55.592
You'll use that.

31:55.592 --> 31:58.178
But not on him.

32:08.813 --> 32:11.983
<i>What did you</i>
<i>communicate, exactly?</i>

32:11.983 --> 32:15.820
I told him to bring up the agenda,
suggest bullet points for the SED,

32:15.820 --> 32:19.991
- but make no demands. - And how did that
translate into a direct ultimatum?

32:19.991 --> 32:23.578
Well, sometimes my delegates
try to read between the lines.

32:23.578 --> 32:27.040
They know that I need plausible
deniability for diplomatic purposes.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.416
Why didn't you
immediately recant?

32:28.416 --> 32:30.168
In my experience with
the Chinese,

32:30.168 --> 32:32.879
backpedaling makes us
look weak. I had two choices:

32:32.879 --> 32:37.467
lose face or exhibit strength.
I chose the latter.

32:37.467 --> 32:41.179
- All right, I'll be in touch shortly.
- Thank you, sir.

32:49.354 --> 32:52.065
Get me Raymond
on the private line.

32:55.735 --> 32:58.613
- Think she overstepped on purpose?
- Cathy would never disobey.

32:58.613 --> 33:02.033
- Not on purpose.
- Raymond, I've got Frank here.

33:02.033 --> 33:05.495
<i>- Just the three of us?</i>
- Just us three. Morning, Raymond.

33:05.495 --> 33:10.375
My contacts in Beijing tell me
the minister of commerce is in a tizzy.

33:10.375 --> 33:13.753
<i>Wants to use this as an excuse</i>
<i>to start clenching fists.</i>

33:13.753 --> 33:16.172
Either I turn my back on Cathy
or I stand behind her.

33:16.172 --> 33:19.342
<i>- It's got to be the former.</i>
- I agree. If you don't apologize,

33:19.342 --> 33:22.178
<i>you go from ruffling feathers</i>
<i>to plucking them.</i>

33:22.178 --> 33:24.514
And the Chinese won't
stand for that, Mr. President.

33:24.514 --> 33:26.891
What about perceived miscommunication
between me and my Cabinet?

33:26.891 --> 33:30.020
<i>Mr. President, right now
the goal is to resume the talks.</i>

33:30.020 --> 33:32.063
I wouldn't worry
about perceptions.

33:32.063 --> 33:33.732
<i>Frank is right.</i>
<i>We need to be pragmatic.</i>

33:33.732 --> 33:35.817
Worry about appearances later.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.698
All right, I'll have Catherine
draft an apology.

33:41.698 --> 33:44.326
No, it has to come
from you, Mr. President.

33:44.326 --> 33:47.287
If the apology is to mean anything,
it must come from the White House.

33:47.287 --> 33:49.956
That is certainly
the more likely to succeed.

33:53.251 --> 33:54.753
Fine. I'll do it, then.

33:54.753 --> 33:57.797
<i>- Thank you, Raymond.</i>
- Thank you, Garrett.

33:59.549 --> 34:03.094
Do you hear how he still
uses the President's given name?

34:03.094 --> 34:07.682
And that Walker doesn't flinch
at the lack of respect it implies?

34:10.393 --> 34:14.813
Sir, forgive me if this isn't
the case, but you seem a bit hesitant.

34:14.813 --> 34:17.734
- Why do you say that?
- Well, you've raised a good point

34:17.734 --> 34:20.110
about public perception.
I don't want you to think

34:20.110 --> 34:24.239
- that I'm dismissing your concerns
casually. - It's a concern for you, too?

34:24.239 --> 34:29.829
- There is some insight into what Cathy
brought up. - Backpedaling as weakness.

34:32.123 --> 34:34.751
Well, it's always a coin toss
with the Chinese.

34:34.751 --> 34:39.630
But sometimes, standing your
ground is better than giving in.

34:39.630 --> 34:42.926
They respect you more
when you show strength.

34:42.926 --> 34:46.137
Are you changing
your mind on this, Frank?

34:46.137 --> 34:50.684
I just think it's important
that you do what you think is best.

34:50.684 --> 34:55.605
The American people voted you
president, not me, not Raymond Tusk.

34:57.607 --> 35:00.652
- I'll let you know what I decide.
- Thank you, sir.

35:05.740 --> 35:08.702
You think she's
Underwood's choice?

35:08.702 --> 35:10.912
He deflected, so it's possible.

35:17.627 --> 35:22.048
You and I, we need
to work together on this, Wes.

35:22.048 --> 35:25.051
- Before we both get screwed.
- I agree.

35:28.054 --> 35:32.559
One of us drops out,
throws support to the other.

35:32.559 --> 35:35.186
That'll dwarf
any following she has.

35:35.186 --> 35:38.356
You want me to drop out.

35:38.356 --> 35:40.734
I'll make sure you get my
chairmanship on Appropriations.

35:44.321 --> 35:48.408
All you can offer me is Ethics,
which nobody wants.

35:51.953 --> 35:54.456
Let's put this to bed, Wes.

35:57.751 --> 35:59.628
Webb must have
offered him a deal.

35:59.628 --> 36:01.129
Then we have
to offer a better one.

36:01.129 --> 36:02.672
I'm guessing Appropriations.

36:02.672 --> 36:04.007
There's no way I can top that.

36:04.007 --> 36:05.717
Except for Ways and Means.

36:08.720 --> 36:11.681
I won't let you give your chair
to an ass like Buchwalter.

36:11.681 --> 36:14.476
If you're the whip, you outrank
him and every other chairman.

36:14.476 --> 36:17.604
Screw committees. I'll have a
direct line to the Speaker.

36:17.604 --> 36:21.608
- Don't be stubborn, Jackie.
- You think he'd take it?

36:21.608 --> 36:23.318
He was willing
to take a deal from Webb.

36:23.318 --> 36:25.904
You're the only person
he hates more.

36:25.904 --> 36:30.200
He's a brute,
but he's not an idiot.

36:38.166 --> 36:40.418
Well, I know you're not
refusing out of loyalty.

36:40.418 --> 36:44.714
- True.
- So it's because of Ted.

36:48.134 --> 36:51.429
You think you are hot shit,
don't you?

36:51.429 --> 36:56.101
Can we set egos aside and
talk business like the adults we are?

36:58.353 --> 37:01.564
- I want more than Ways and Means.
- Tell me.

37:01.564 --> 37:05.652
I want Havemeyer gone.
Not just retired...

37:10.448 --> 37:12.701
...politically dead.

37:12.701 --> 37:14.828
That race was 12 years ago.

37:14.828 --> 37:17.414
That was 12 years
I could've been in the Senate.

37:17.414 --> 37:22.377
Revenge? Really?

37:22.377 --> 37:24.713
Not revenge.

37:26.172 --> 37:28.049
Equity.

37:29.718 --> 37:33.430
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- Buchwalter won't budge.

37:33.430 --> 37:37.684
You know, there's nothing
I despise more in life than pettiness.

37:37.684 --> 37:40.687
I could approach Webb,
but I don't have enough to offer him.

37:40.687 --> 37:44.107
He'd never drop out.
Too much pride.

37:44.107 --> 37:47.652
- I'm not sure what to do.
- This is my file on Ted.

37:47.652 --> 37:50.739
An illegitimate daughter.
The nanny, of course.

37:50.739 --> 37:54.618
Her name is Emily Rodriguez.
Nineteen, cerebral palsy.

37:54.618 --> 37:56.745
I know about Emily.

37:59.414 --> 38:02.334
- Why are we having this conversation?
- It's complicated.

38:02.334 --> 38:05.503
The daughter? It's very
black-and-white to me.

38:05.503 --> 38:09.883
I've known Ted since I was born.
He and my father were very close.

38:09.883 --> 38:12.886
- Yeah, I'm aware.
- He's always looked out for me.

38:12.886 --> 38:15.597
He got me into West Point.
He funded my first race.

38:15.597 --> 38:17.807
I like Ted. He's always
been a team player.

38:17.807 --> 38:20.435
- It's unfortunate he has this secret.
- It was a mistake.

38:20.435 --> 38:22.812
One he's always regretted.
After she was born,

38:22.812 --> 38:25.565
he asked me to check in on her
because he couldn't.

38:25.565 --> 38:30.779
- Because he trusted me.
- I see.

38:30.779 --> 38:34.032
You came in here knowing
what you had to do,

38:34.032 --> 38:36.826
hoping I would pull a rabbit
out of a hat so you wouldn't have to.

38:36.826 --> 38:41.957
I know the girl. I know her mother.
These people don't deserve this.

38:41.957 --> 38:45.126
I've given you all I can.
Whatever you decide is your prerogative.

38:45.126 --> 38:49.798
- But maybe I misjudged you.
- Ted is family to me.

38:49.798 --> 38:53.551
An adopted daughter,
in lieu of a real one.

38:53.551 --> 38:56.513
- Sir, the secretary is here.
- Thank you. Send her in.

38:56.513 --> 38:58.890
Excuse us.

39:09.359 --> 39:11.236
- It's good.
- Not too long?

39:11.236 --> 39:13.530
A little bit, but not much.

39:13.530 --> 39:17.867
- This part, three paragraphs in.
- About the phone companies?

39:17.867 --> 39:21.246
- Tell me more. - It's one of
Homeland Security's major concerns.

39:21.246 --> 39:23.915
That the cyberattacks might
infiltrate phone carriers,

39:23.915 --> 39:26.251
get access to millions
of people's data history.

39:26.251 --> 39:28.628
- Like who they called?
- Yeah. Who they called, texted,

39:28.628 --> 39:31.715
what they texted, when,
where they were. Everything.

39:31.715 --> 39:35.802
- And that's possible? - There haven't been
any catastrophic breaches yet.

39:35.802 --> 39:38.471
At least not reported.
But it looks like the Chinese are starting

39:38.471 --> 39:41.182
to recruit mercenaries on the Deep Web
to launch guerilla-type attacks

39:41.182 --> 39:43.685
- that can't be traced back...
- Hold on. The "Deep Web."

39:43.685 --> 39:46.479
- I've heard of that.
- Yeah, no, 96 percent of the Internet

39:46.479 --> 39:49.482
isn't accessible through standard
search engines. Most of it's useless.

39:49.482 --> 39:52.527
But it's where you go to find
anything and everything:

39:52.527 --> 39:56.865
child porn, bitcoin laundering,
mail-order narcotics, hackers for hire.

39:56.865 --> 39:59.492
- How do you access it?
- It's actually pretty easy.

39:59.492 --> 40:01.995
- I could show you if you want.
- Yeah, I'm curious.

40:01.995 --> 40:04.122
- Mind if I...?
- Go ahead.

40:04.122 --> 40:05.999
First thing you need's Tor.

40:05.999 --> 40:09.252
Some people prefer I2P,
but I think Tor is better.

40:09.252 --> 40:14.257
- What is Tor? - Protects you through
proxy servers, keeps you anonymous.

40:14.257 --> 40:16.718
Then I'll show how to get
to the posting boards and the IRCs.

40:16.718 --> 40:22.474
But I gotta warn you, be careful
what you click. Some crazy shit there, man.

40:22.474 --> 40:26.478
For too long,
we've danced on eggshells

40:26.478 --> 40:29.481
regarding the issue
of cyberwarfare.

40:29.481 --> 40:35.904
<i>Secretary Durant acted on instructions</i>
<i>that came directly from me.</i>

40:35.904 --> 40:38.990
<i>Now, if the Chinese are not willing
to engage in a meaningful dialogue</i>

40:38.990 --> 40:41.576
<i>about intellectual property</i>
<i>of American corporations,</i>

40:41.576 --> 40:46.122
<i>as well as this deliberate targeting of
our government's online infrastructure,</i>

40:46.122 --> 40:48.875
<i>well, then that is proof</i>
<i>of a double-standard mentality</i>

40:48.875 --> 40:51.002
<i>that we shall</i>
<i>no longer tolerate.</i>

40:51.002 --> 40:54.881
<i>Our delegation to the Joint Commission</i>
<i>on Commerce and Trade</i>

40:54.881 --> 40:58.301
<i>was unfairly accused and defamed</i>

40:58.301 --> 41:02.305
<i>by representatives of the</i>
<i>United States government.</i>

41:02.305 --> 41:04.265
<i>The People's Republic of China</i>

41:04.265 --> 41:09.729
<i>will not be threatened by
derisive and unsubstantiated claims.</i>

41:09.729 --> 41:13.858
<i>As long as the White House</i>
<i>continues to behave this way,</i>

41:13.858 --> 41:18.905
<i>any future bilateral trade</i>
<i>talks will be impossible.</i>

41:18.905 --> 41:20.824
It caught me by surprise, too.

41:20.824 --> 41:23.868
Did you say anything to him
after I hung up yesterday?

41:23.868 --> 41:27.122
- No. Have you spoken to him?
- <i> A few minutes ago.</i>

41:27.122 --> 41:29.416
He said he did
what he thought was right.

41:29.416 --> 41:31.668
<i>Well, there's nothing</i>
<i>we can do to combat that.</i>

41:31.668 --> 41:35.714
He doesn't usually go against
my advice without giving me fair warning.

41:35.714 --> 41:40.677
- What are you suggesting, Raymond?
- He's easily manipulated.

41:40.677 --> 41:43.513
- Clearly, not in this case.
- <i> We need to fix this.</i>

41:43.513 --> 41:47.017
<i>- And I'm counting on you for that, Frank.</i>
- Let me freshen your memory.

41:47.017 --> 41:51.313
<i>I don't owe you any favors.</i>
<i>I promised to work with you, not for you.</i>

41:51.313 --> 41:53.606
And when it comes to China,
we both want the same thing.

41:53.606 --> 41:57.110
- So we need to work together.
<i>- To convince Garrett he should retract.</i>

41:57.110 --> 41:59.362
To support the president
in the path that he's chosen.

41:59.362 --> 42:02.115
While he continues
to antagonize them publicly.

42:02.115 --> 42:05.035
While he continues to benefit
from a bump in approval ratings.

42:05.035 --> 42:09.539
<i>A tough stance on China is popular,
and we can use that to our advantage.</i>

42:09.539 --> 42:12.626
<i>Let's just be patient and see if we can
smooth things over from back channels.</i>

42:12.626 --> 42:15.503
If I don't see any results,
you won't have my patience for long.

42:15.503 --> 42:20.342
- That's understood.
- Let me know what Durant has to say.

42:20.342 --> 42:23.678
- Absolutely.
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

42:26.848 --> 42:30.894
I thought he might balk
at taking a handout from me.

42:30.894 --> 42:32.771
I'd call it more than a handout.

42:32.771 --> 42:37.692
Well, he's always been the sort of man
who could be bought,

42:37.692 --> 42:40.070
but never cheaply.

42:40.070 --> 42:43.865
It's not the chairmanship
that bought him, Ted.

42:43.865 --> 42:45.909
What do you mean?

42:45.909 --> 42:49.245
I'm telling you this so that
you have time to call your wife

42:49.245 --> 42:51.414
and prepare your statement.

42:58.797 --> 43:01.925
What's my out?
What's he want from me?

43:01.925 --> 43:04.678
There is no out.
He wants it to hurt.

43:07.013 --> 43:09.015
- You told him?
- I just promised him

43:09.015 --> 43:12.602
- that I could make it happen.
- You can't do this, Jackie.

43:12.602 --> 43:15.647
The story's breaking tomorrow.

43:15.647 --> 43:19.567
- What part of it?
- No names. Just that you have a daughter.

43:19.567 --> 43:23.113
Have you thought about
what this will do to Diane?

43:23.113 --> 43:27.200
- To our sons?
- I hate myself for it.

43:27.200 --> 43:30.453
- But I'll get over that.
- What about her?

43:30.453 --> 43:34.624
- Emily? You can't even say
her name, can you? - Don't lecture me.

43:34.624 --> 43:36.209
You've never been
in the same room with her.

43:36.209 --> 43:38.628
She's had the best
treatment available.

43:38.628 --> 43:40.714
Alone. Hooked up
to machines.

43:40.714 --> 43:43.216
Surrounded by nurses
who punch out at dinnertime.

43:43.216 --> 43:46.052
- You don't know what I've been through.
- You? What about her?

43:46.052 --> 43:50.223
- I can't do more than I've done.
- That's bullshit, Ted.

43:50.223 --> 43:52.809
- You could've found a way.
- I won't defend myself to you.

43:52.809 --> 43:55.520
Don't. Save that
for your wife.

43:59.816 --> 44:03.069
This isn't to punish you, Ted.
It's simpler than that.

44:03.069 --> 44:05.113
When I first encouraged
you to run for office,

44:05.113 --> 44:09.034
it's because I sensed
how unstoppable you were.

44:09.034 --> 44:14.789
But I never thought I'd have
to lie down on the tracks myself.

44:16.124 --> 44:19.669
If you're going to put
my neck in the noose,

44:19.669 --> 44:23.882
look me in the eye
while you do it.

44:32.182 --> 44:35.727
I'm very grateful
for all that you've done for me.

44:35.727 --> 44:38.647
You'll make an excellent
whip, Jacqueline.

44:38.647 --> 44:41.733
Now, please
get out of my office.

44:57.123 --> 44:59.459
What are you doing?

45:00.627 --> 45:02.963
Sh, sh, sh, sh!

45:10.345 --> 45:13.932
It's finally quiet.

45:16.518 --> 45:20.397
It is, isn't it?

45:20.397 --> 45:24.192
We have our fortress now.

45:24.192 --> 45:27.487
- Where are you coming from?
- My new office.

45:27.487 --> 45:30.031
You just finished
setting it up today.

45:30.031 --> 45:33.910
- Do you like it?
- It's an office. It's fine.

46:19.831 --> 58:40.513
