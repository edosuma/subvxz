WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.490
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.560 --> 00:05.721
You're gonna sell dope
whether it's legal or not.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.643
But you set
your sights this high,

00:07.720 --> 00:09.449
you're gonna keep running
into folks like him.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.409
So, you're saying
walk away from weed?

00:11.480 --> 00:14.404
Next couple weeks, just put
two big guys out front.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.323
Whoever killed Simon Poole

00:16.400 --> 00:18.607
is probably the same person
who killed Grady in prison,

00:18.680 --> 00:20.284
all at the behest of

00:20.360 --> 00:22.966
whoever ratted on
Grady to begin with.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.280
And you think it's Markham?

00:24.400 --> 00:26.084
Well, the guy who
ratted on Grady

00:26.160 --> 00:27.844
turned my life to shit,

00:27.920 --> 00:30.491
and I want something
like that to happen to him.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.561
Walker is burned.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.881
Got to stay out
of that fire he started.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.645
It's about loyalty.
And I need yours.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.803
That stack of money
in Markham's vault,

00:38.880 --> 00:40.962
it's got to be $10 million, Ava.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.121
You help Raylan put me away.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.804
What's he got to offer you?

00:43.880 --> 00:45.689
A clean slate
in witness protection?

00:46.080 --> 00:47.080
50 grand.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.804
There's 50 grand.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.645
<i>And there's $10 million.</i>

00:51.040 --> 00:52.530
What happened in Bulletville?

00:52.600 --> 00:54.125
You in trouble?
No.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.684
The dynamite Zachariah had

00:56.760 --> 00:58.250
ain't to blow the doors
off the vault.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.401
It's for the rock below.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.448
<i>Boyd's gonna blast up
from underneath.</i>

01:01.520 --> 01:03.602
What's the bad news?
Ava's burned.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.728
<i>- You sure?</i>
- Pretty sure.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.924
So, this is all
based on a hunch.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.810
When you phrase it like that,
it's mildly insulting.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.560
So, did Boyd find out
and put Ava under duress,

01:15.640 --> 01:17.051
or did she just break?

01:17.120 --> 01:19.248
Well, Chief, I...

01:20.240 --> 01:22.402
I'm sorry, who are we
addressing as Chief?

01:22.920 --> 01:24.046
Me.
Her.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.485
Well, Mr. Mullen,

01:25.560 --> 01:26.607
I can't say for certain.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.842
All I can say for certain
is that she's flipped.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.922
If I'm wrong, you can
have Arlo's place.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.366
And what if you're right?

01:32.480 --> 01:35.290
You can still have it.
I can't give it away.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.920
Wait a second. Are we
worried about Ava?

01:37.360 --> 01:39.442
There's a chance she may
have been compromised.

01:39.520 --> 01:40.646
Well, that's not
really a surprise

01:40.720 --> 01:42.722
given the fact that
Boyd now has $100,000

01:42.800 --> 01:44.928
and has no doubt promised
her millions more.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.763
You didn't think I knew
about your little reward?

01:47.840 --> 01:50.127
Just attempting to move the case along.
That's all that was.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.567
Instead, you might've gotten
your C.I. to switch sides.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.805
This case isn't dependent on
whether or not Ava flipped.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.769
That's not necessarily true.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.924
At this point,
we have Boyd connected

02:00.000 --> 02:02.002
to just about every
crime in Lexington.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.605
But if you want to
get him under RICO,

02:03.680 --> 02:05.170
you want to really bury him,

02:05.240 --> 02:07.527
then you need the cooperation
of his criminal associates,

02:07.600 --> 02:08.806
the closest of which is Ava.

02:09.759 --> 02:11.524
Well, if she's flipped,

02:11.600 --> 02:13.921
well, then her
involvement's tainted

02:14.000 --> 02:15.286
and so is her testimony.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.800
Only way to be sure

02:16.880 --> 02:18.803
would be to have another C.I.
in the Boyd camp.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.041
Sure, that's not complicated.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.844
Let's get another C.I.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.400
I actually think I might
be able to help with that.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.485
Forget something, Mikey?

02:32.240 --> 02:33.605
Oh! Holy shit.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.365
That's pretty high on the list
of things I wish I'd never seen.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.560
You should've thought of that

02:37.600 --> 02:40.206
before you barged into
my hotel room uninvited.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.645
All right,
if you just calm down,

02:41.720 --> 02:42.926
we'll explain why we're here.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.843
I don't care why you're here.
I don't want an explanation.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.082
I just want you two to get your
bony white asses out of my...

02:54.960 --> 02:56.724
You see these?
I can't see shit.

02:56.840 --> 02:57.966
Well, these are case files

02:58.040 --> 03:00.611
we need to discuss with
you once you calm down.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.806
Ah! Okay!

03:01.880 --> 03:02.880
You gonna calm down?
Yes!

03:02.920 --> 03:04.206
You don't sound calm.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.442
Let me out of here,
I'll calm down!

03:06.520 --> 03:08.045
And we can have
a civil conversation?

03:08.120 --> 03:09.121
Fine.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.283
Jesus Christ, Raylan.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.444
You're supposed
to be the grownup.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.841
Ah, you're only as young
as you feel, Duffy.

03:22.920 --> 03:23.967
Take a look.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.205
Where did you get this?

03:30.280 --> 03:31.361
That came from an old-time

03:31.480 --> 03:33.403
U.S. Attorney named
Simon Poole,

03:33.480 --> 03:35.209
and it was sealed
about 15 years ago.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.124
This is bullshit. Want to go
back in the tanning booth?

03:37.200 --> 03:38.770
I had an agreement
with your people

03:38.880 --> 03:40.769
that my involvement... You had
an arrangement with Simon Poole,

03:40.840 --> 03:42.604
and if you got a problem,
you take it up with him.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.727
He's dead.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.040
Well, that's unfortunate.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.286
He was murdered
around the same time

03:46.360 --> 03:47.725
those records were sealed.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.167
Wonder if that's a coincidence.
Hmm.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.690
Congratulations. You got me.
I was a rat.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.722
The ship was sinking, and I
didn't want to go down with it.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.763
So what?
We ain't here to judge.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.330
We just want you
to do it again.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.087
And how about if I ask
you to lick my balls?

04:05.160 --> 04:06.764
In that case, we're
probably gonna leave.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.490
This is not
a civil conversation.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.763
But I'd hate to see the information
in these files get leaked.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.604
Like, what would
happen if Katherine Hale

04:13.680 --> 04:16.570
found out that you're the one
who got her husband killed?

04:20.600 --> 04:22.364
I didn't know there was
a statute of limitations

04:22.440 --> 04:25.091
on the gratitude of lawmen
towards old informants.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.282
Well, there is.
And it is up.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.691
You burn me, I'm dead.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.044
That's a possibility.
Pretty much.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.010
Wait. Just wait.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.567
Maybe there is a way
I can help you out again.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.446
But why?

05:15.520 --> 05:16.521
Why?

05:16.600 --> 05:18.204
Because I like
being alive and free.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.361
Don't you?

05:21.080 --> 05:23.208
Not if it means
being a goddamn snitch.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.240
Jesus Christ, don't
be so self-righteous.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.524
At some point
in our line of work,

05:29.640 --> 05:31.802
if you want to survive,
this is what you do.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.006
Not me.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.082
I got a code, and it does not

05:35.160 --> 05:36.764
include turning on my people.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.842
And by "your people,"
you mean who?

05:38.920 --> 05:41.082
Boyd? Katherine? Markham?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.684
You think any of them
wouldn't turn on us

05:43.760 --> 05:45.603
to save their own hides?

05:49.560 --> 05:52.006
You know, if you intended
to run for office,

05:52.120 --> 05:54.122
that would've been
information worth knowing

05:54.200 --> 05:55.725
before I agreed to marry you.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.288
I assure you I have no interest
in becoming a politician.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.848
But you are interested
in parading me around

06:01.920 --> 06:04.685
shit holler, Kentucky,
like a politician's wife.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.128
It's important that I
engage these people.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.248
I promise you won't have
to kiss any babies.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.450
Just promise me I don't
have to eat any pizza.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.610
Back up slowly.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.320
One of yours?

06:28.360 --> 06:29.407
He was.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.446
This what you were
pounding in Lexington

06:31.520 --> 06:32.646
while we were pounding doors?

06:32.720 --> 06:34.722
Show the lady a little respect.
Oh, chivalrous.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.404
You're not in a position
to tell me shit.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.562
Now sit your ass down,
both of you.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.844
What exactly are you after?

06:45.360 --> 06:46.441
Call it severance pay.

06:46.520 --> 06:47.646
Severance?

06:47.760 --> 06:49.922
Seems to me I just
paid for your loyalty.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.240
No, no. Point in fact,

06:51.320 --> 06:54.642
you paid for my disloyalty
to my former C.O.,

06:54.720 --> 06:56.404
a man who you cut loose
and sold out.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.170
Has me refiguring my cost.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.125
You know where my money is.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.526
Think you can get to it,
have at it.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.364
Good idea, boss, yeah.
I'll just...

07:05.440 --> 07:06.880
I'll just take a ride
down to Harlan,

07:06.920 --> 07:08.410
keeping the radio on, of course,

07:08.520 --> 07:11.524
in case you see fit to call
the soft rock militia on me.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.531
Though I suppose
you wouldn't want me

07:13.600 --> 07:15.090
getting caught, now, would you?

07:15.200 --> 07:16.725
Oh, the tales that I could tell.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.121
I'll tell you what.

07:20.160 --> 07:21.286
How about you give me
the lady's ring,

07:21.360 --> 07:23.010
and we'll call it a day?

07:23.680 --> 07:25.921
The lady is my fiancée.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.163
That's her engagement ring.
It has sentimental value.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.049
Unless it can bring the both
of you back from the dead,

07:31.120 --> 07:32.121
hand it over.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.124
You really think killing us
in this hotel room

07:35.200 --> 07:36.850
is your best bet for freedom

07:36.920 --> 07:38.684
and long-term prosperity?

07:38.760 --> 07:39.807
I'll take my chances.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.245
Ah, Gentlemen.
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.402
May I make a suggestion?

07:43.480 --> 07:46.290
I have a diamond tennis
bracelet in my purse

07:46.400 --> 07:49.802
that, being a woman
of extravagant taste,

07:49.880 --> 07:52.565
it's very substantial.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.085
Might that do instead?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.406
It just might.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.641
Let me see it.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.286
Slowly.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.486
Think it's in here.
Yep.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.241
I thought I'd seen
all your tricks.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.886
Well, if you feel compelled
to show your gratitude,

08:33.960 --> 08:35.724
I could sure use a new purse.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.201
<i>Merci.</i>

08:49.320 --> 08:50.481
You told him what?

08:50.800 --> 08:53.201
He already knew you were gonna
hit the Portal through the mine.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.486
How did he know that?

08:54.560 --> 08:55.721
You're working with Zachariah.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.040
Probably wasn't tough to figure.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.044
Jesus Christ, Ava.

09:02.520 --> 09:05.046
If I had played dumb, he
would've known I was lying,

09:05.120 --> 09:06.804
locked me up again.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.685
You know what?

09:12.400 --> 09:14.050
Let 'em come.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.730
They're gonna be watching
the main entrance.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.201
We slipping out the
ventilation shaft, anyway.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.281
We'll be sipping margaritas

09:19.360 --> 09:20.407
before they even know
what happened.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.925
So, you're saying I did good.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.041
Yeah.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.010
Baby, you always do good.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.651
Wynn Duffy.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.243
You're a long way away
from home, ain't you?

09:32.320 --> 09:35.164
Home's wherever
the RV takes me, Boyd.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.324
And the matter which
we need to discuss

09:37.400 --> 09:39.243
requires our
immediate attention.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.890
Well, you look awful serious.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.681
Ava, you want to
give us a minute?

09:42.760 --> 09:44.808
I was under the impression
you two had no secrets.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.328
Was I misinformed?

09:48.120 --> 09:49.610
Ain't no secrets here.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.725
Say what you got to say.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.526
You're aware that
Markham's hosting

09:54.600 --> 09:55.640
a gathering this afternoon?

09:55.840 --> 09:56.841
I am.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.046
But I don't think
Avery Markham's

09:58.120 --> 10:00.487
gonna win over the hearts and minds
of the good people of Harlan County

10:00.560 --> 10:01.925
with a few slices of pepperoni.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.368
Well, that may be,
but when the party's over,

10:05.440 --> 10:06.771
he's planning on
moving the money.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.560
Who told you that?

10:10.720 --> 10:12.768
Katherine. She says
it's happening tonight.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.604
Does she know exactly where
this new location's gonna be?

10:16.720 --> 10:17.801
No.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.571
So, you came here
to tell me my only chance

10:21.680 --> 10:23.170
of getting that money

10:23.240 --> 10:24.480
is during that goddamn party?

10:25.080 --> 10:26.366
Is that gonna be a problem?

10:26.440 --> 10:28.124
Ain't no problem I can't handle.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.882
Better news I've never heard.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.246
You let me know when it's done.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.731
Well, of course I will.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.324
Well, thank you.
Good luck.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.970
Let me know if I can
be of any assistance.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.485
And now, if you'll excuse me,

10:39.560 --> 10:42.040
I'm gonna leave this place and
hopefully never come back.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.610
Raylan Givens
is pulling his string.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.523
If he is, he did not tell me.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.521
This is the moment

10:59.320 --> 11:00.890
we play our onetime
"get out of jail free" card.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.086
You okay with that?

11:03.480 --> 11:04.606
I am.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.761
How we doing?

11:12.160 --> 11:14.766
Right now, we're within
four feet of that basement.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.649
What I got to do
is set two more charges

11:16.720 --> 11:19.007
one to blow through the rook to
get to the basement foundation

11:19.080 --> 11:20.525
and another one to blow
out that concrete.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.840
It's gonna take too long.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.160
Well, you said I had two days.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.924
Well, now you got two hours.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.684
Now, what say we do
a deep set of drill holes

11:26.760 --> 11:28.922
in the foundation, do two
charges simultaneously?

11:29.040 --> 11:30.166
Oh, no, no, no.
That's too risky.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.607
What's risky is not getting
that goddamn money.

11:32.680 --> 11:33.760
Well, what's your hurry now?

11:33.800 --> 11:35.240
That's a little
above your pay grade.

11:35.400 --> 11:36.640
Just get it done.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.242
I'm depending on you,
Uncle Zachariah!

11:45.280 --> 11:46.611
Son of a bitch.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.528
Here comes
the douche mobile.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.281
Done.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.885
You mind clarifying that?

12:12.480 --> 12:13.520
Boyd's under the impression

12:13.560 --> 12:15.080
that Markham's moving
his money tonight

12:15.120 --> 12:16.770
and plans to hit
the vault imminently.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.407
And Ava was there?

12:18.480 --> 12:19.925
She heard you say the
money was moving tonight?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.731
She was, though I have no idea
why that was a requirement.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.689
So if she's not actually
present at the robbery,

12:24.760 --> 12:26.489
we can still put her
away for conspiracy.

12:26.560 --> 12:27.607
Ruthless.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.251
So, Boy Wonder know what
team he's playing for now?

12:30.320 --> 12:31.731
He took it kind of
hard at first,

12:31.800 --> 12:33.450
but he'll come around.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.689
It's like catching daddy cheating
with the woman next door, huh?

12:38.880 --> 12:39.961
Are we done here?

12:40.040 --> 12:42.611
When exactly is he
gonna hit the vault?

12:42.680 --> 12:43.966
During the party.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.281
I'd also like to know what kind
of weaponry he's gonna use,

12:46.360 --> 12:49.125
who's gonna be with him, and where
he plans to hole up afterwards.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.043
"Hey, Boyd, Wynn Duffy again.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.845
"I know, super weird.
I was just wondering,

12:53.960 --> 12:56.122
"could you give me an exact
time for the robbery?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.770
"Also wondering
if you can tell me

12:57.880 --> 12:59.166
"what weapons you'll be using

12:59.240 --> 13:01.208
"and who else is
participating."

13:01.520 --> 13:03.249
Tell him we know
where the main entrance is,

13:03.320 --> 13:05.084
but we'd like to know
if there's another entrance

13:05.160 --> 13:06.571
he plans to slip out in.

13:06.680 --> 13:07.966
I can't get you all that.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.530
Oh, sure you can.
No.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.684
You know what?
Call him back.

13:11.760 --> 13:14.480
Say, "Hey, it's Wynn." I don't trust
you, and I ain't claustrophobic,

13:14.520 --> 13:15.885
"so I want in on
the heist this evening."

13:15.960 --> 13:17.928
Not happening.
Not a chance.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.525
If you don't want to
spend the rest of your life

13:19.600 --> 13:21.125
running from the Dixie mafia,

13:21.200 --> 13:24.044
there is a very,
very good chance.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.281
Hello!

14:20.320 --> 14:23.244
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to startle you.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.810
Why would I be startled?

14:25.360 --> 14:28.045
Some asshole comes in my house
without so much as knocking?

14:28.120 --> 14:30.361
That's a totally
natural reaction.

14:30.440 --> 14:31.521
When I was just a pup,

14:31.640 --> 14:33.847
my mama used to say I tended
to leap before I looked.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.570
Well, if you're done looking,

14:35.640 --> 14:37.688
now would be a good time to
scoot your ass on out of here.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.205
My name's Boon,
I'm new to the area,

14:39.280 --> 14:41.203
and I just wanted to
say hi to my neighbor,

14:41.280 --> 14:44.921
who, if you don't mind me
saying so, is a vision...

14:47.000 --> 14:48.047
Oh.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.286
You know you have a dead
snake on your floor there?

14:52.360 --> 14:53.885
From where I'm standing,

14:53.960 --> 14:57.442
it looks like someone
shot that head clean off.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.804
I don't suppose it was you.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.526
Was it?

15:07.840 --> 15:10.320
I don't suppose you can get
out of my house like I asked.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.846
'Cause that'd be
one hell of a shot,

15:12.920 --> 15:15.207
to get just the head like that.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.886
Masterful, really.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.080
How you think he did it?

15:21.160 --> 15:22.889
You think it was
a quick draw scenario?

15:22.960 --> 15:24.291
Bang!

15:25.600 --> 15:28.080
But there's really no
reason to do that, huh?

15:28.160 --> 15:30.401
You'd just be
showing off, I guess.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.050
I mean, you could pull quick,

15:32.160 --> 15:35.369
but then you'd really
want to take your time...

15:35.440 --> 15:37.522
Making that shot, right?

15:39.520 --> 15:41.568
Make sure you hit it just right.

15:42.520 --> 15:46.445
Regardless, whoever
shot that snake

15:46.520 --> 15:50.286
is one deranged and possibly
dangerous individual.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.522
If you've made
any enemies lately,

15:52.600 --> 15:54.921
I'd highly advise you
to make peace

15:55.000 --> 15:57.321
by any and all means necessary

15:57.400 --> 16:00.927
just so they don't send
this idiot back here again.

16:02.680 --> 16:03.681
Yeah.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.489
Be a real shame
to come home one day

16:05.560 --> 16:07.483
and find some lunatic
standing in my house.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.963
You really are a beautiful girl.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.250
You know that?

16:13.280 --> 16:16.489
I promise I'll stop back
here again real soon,

16:16.560 --> 16:17.846
if you're still around,

16:17.920 --> 16:20.241
just to make sure
everything's all right.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.920
Hey.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.164
Do you need help getting
rid of that snake?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.605
I'll be fine.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.205
I bet you will.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.487
Bye, Loretta.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.525
Ava, I need you
to be on lookout for

16:47.600 --> 16:48.840
anything unusual

16:48.920 --> 16:51.844
extra security, KSP, Marshals.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.207
When Carl tells you to pull
that alarm, what happens?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.770
I pull the alarm.
Then what?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.205
Make sure we get out
of there as fast as we can.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.361
But first?

16:58.440 --> 16:59.646
Make sure
she gets out,

16:59.720 --> 17:01.165
and then we all meet at
the rendezvous as agreed.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.321
My goddamn man.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.406
Now, we need to
get dressed, so...

17:04.480 --> 17:06.608
I don't think you're
in the right place, honey.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.607
No, ma'am.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.207
Just looking for a word with Mr.
Crowder.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.930
I recognize you.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
You're Walt McCready's
daughter, god rest his soul.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.925
That's right.

17:17.319 --> 17:19.084
Well, I'd offer you a drink,
but we're in a bit of a hurry,

17:19.160 --> 17:22.130
so what can I help you
with, Miss McCready?

17:22.280 --> 17:23.611
You know I own the Bennett land?

17:23.680 --> 17:24.727
I do.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.768
You also know I'm looking
to acquire more.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.126
I've heard rumors.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.565
Well, then you also heard

17:29.640 --> 17:31.608
I know more about growing weed

17:31.680 --> 17:34.809
than most of the cornbread boys
who've lived and died in these hills.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.407
What I don't have
is muscle or distribution.

17:39.160 --> 17:42.960
Services you were
hoping I might provide.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.246
It would mean going up
against Avery Markham.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.960
He's shaking your tree
a little bit, is he?

17:49.600 --> 17:51.682
Yeah, well, the protection
aspect of this partnership

17:51.760 --> 17:53.330
would be priority.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.606
What about
Raylan Givens?

17:54.680 --> 17:55.841
What about him?

17:55.920 --> 17:58.730
Well, as I understand it,
he's quite fond of you.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.211
Now, how you think
he's gonna feel

18:00.280 --> 18:02.362
he finds out you in
business with me?

18:02.440 --> 18:04.169
I got bigger problems
than Raylan.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.288
Last I heard, he ain't
long for Harlan, anyway.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.523
You really got Mag's money?

18:08.840 --> 18:10.649
I don't see how that's
any of your business.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.802
'Cause Bennett land
ain't gonna be enough.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.890
You'll need the Sorenson land,

18:14.960 --> 18:16.371
which has the soil runoff
from Blanton creek.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.448
You'll need the McLaren land, which has...
Southern exposure

18:18.520 --> 18:20.921
and the best bluegrass
south of Pine Mountain.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.402
Gonna grow some
healthy black gold.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.369
Well, damn, girl.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.646
You done some thinking on this.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.210
Enough to also figure

18:30.280 --> 18:31.964
Markham's probably
staked out them parcels.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.528
Sorensons and McLaren

18:34.600 --> 18:35.806
and a half dozen others

18:35.880 --> 18:37.962
have agreed to hold off
selling to Markham.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.804
They're gonna sell only to me.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.686
How much you asking?

18:50.080 --> 18:53.289
You want 'em, you can have 'em.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.449
You buy them for a reasonable
price from the owners.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.249
You pay me nothing.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.047
You keep Harlan for Harlan.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.085
Why would you do that?

19:04.280 --> 19:06.760
'Cause I'm a bad man, Loretta.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.482
But Avery Markham
is a real bad man.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.129
Now, my men will see to
it that you are protected

19:12.200 --> 19:14.441
as long as you pay them
handsomely for their efforts.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.851
Earl, will you please
show this young...

19:15.920 --> 19:17.570
No, I don't need seeing out.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.801
Just need you
to keep your word is all.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.004
You play your cards
right, young lady,

19:24.080 --> 19:25.889
this town will be yours.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.086
Earl.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.882
Don't crowd me, boy.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.162
All happening so fast.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.161
Well, if you want
to get nostalgic,

19:40.280 --> 19:41.520
now's the time to do it,

19:41.600 --> 19:43.409
'cause this is gonna be
the last night

19:43.480 --> 19:46.131
we spend in Harlan County.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.886
Cool hat.
What's your pleasure?

19:58.960 --> 20:00.041
Whiskey.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.485
Any particular kind?

20:01.560 --> 20:03.005
It's free, right?

20:04.160 --> 20:06.128
The most expensive kind.

20:38.360 --> 20:39.725
Didn't think I'd see you here,

20:39.840 --> 20:41.330
considering who's hosting.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.767
That's
exactly why I'm here.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.161
You got more balls than
sense, you know that, girl?

20:46.320 --> 20:47.890
Ain't that what
they say about you?

20:48.440 --> 20:49.771
It is.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.684
And maybe
it's our kindred spirits

20:52.760 --> 20:55.161
that's prompting me to make
the offer I'm about to make.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.364
Arlo's home and plot.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.169
You know the land
I'm speaking of?

21:01.520 --> 21:02.601
I do.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.371
You interested?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.722
Well, for a reasonable
price, I assume.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.683
I just want what it's worth.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.684
In that case,
you got yourself a deal.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.530
Twice in one day?

21:13.960 --> 21:15.485
Aren't I a lucky man?

21:15.960 --> 21:16.961
Tell you what.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.644
That dress never had it so good.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.963
Name's Boon.
Pleased to meet you.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.530
I wouldn't rush
to judgment on that.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.682
I think it's safe to say,
considering everything

21:25.760 --> 21:27.240
I've heard about you
from my employer.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.286
I venture you're another one
of his, uh, Colorado boys?

21:30.360 --> 21:31.360
That's right.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.447
Tending to his fields out there.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.289
Not tending so much
as protecting.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.169
Well, I feel I should warn you.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.685
Markham's previous
employees have

21:37.760 --> 21:39.410
not fared well in these parts.

21:39.520 --> 21:42.126
What? Them military
jarhead guys?

21:42.200 --> 21:43.611
'Course not.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.849
Those boys don't have no soul.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.641
They don't know what it is
to really live it down.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.881
You know what I mean?

21:50.720 --> 21:52.529
I do not, no.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.721
Man, you are everything
I'd hoped for,

21:56.080 --> 21:57.570
right down to the hat.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.729
Do you know the man
who invented the Stetson

21:59.800 --> 22:01.370
was actually from New Jersey?

22:01.440 --> 22:02.726
Is that so?

22:02.840 --> 22:04.524
Came up with the idea
prospecting out west.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.282
Cool in the summer,
warm in the winters.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.488
A more functional piece of
headwear never there was.

22:09.560 --> 22:10.846
Hey, I got an idea.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.126
Instead of running your mouth,

22:12.200 --> 22:13.486
why don't you show
your gun to the Marshal

22:13.600 --> 22:15.568
the way you showed it to
me, see what happens?

22:15.640 --> 22:18.325
Yes. If the Marshal
wants to see my piece,

22:18.440 --> 22:19.965
all he's got to do is ask.

22:21.480 --> 22:24.370
Should I assume that's a
toy gun there, John Wayne,

22:24.440 --> 22:26.841
or you got another holster with
a concealed permit inside?

22:27.440 --> 22:29.169
Afraid I don't know John Wayne.

22:29.560 --> 22:30.891
He was a movie cowboy.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.601
Oh.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.886
Well, I never had much
use for television or movies.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.050
Or regard for your wellbeing

22:39.120 --> 22:40.724
the way you show off that piece.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.927
Loretta, I look forward to
calling on you again soon.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.369
Those two make quite the pair.

23:04.440 --> 23:06.329
That's the infamous Boyd Crowder

23:06.400 --> 23:08.323
you've had to hear
so much about.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.481
Huh.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.004
He is more

23:12.080 --> 23:14.481
pulled together than
I would've imagined.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.006
She's a pretty thing.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.491
Yes. The lovely Ava.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.723
Told him if they ever
set foot in here again,

23:24.840 --> 23:26.046
I'd kill them both.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.649
Well, that would put quite a
damper on your party, dear.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.250
I suppose it would.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.522
Well, time has come.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.610
Wish me luck.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.011
Good luck.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.644
Friends
and neighbors.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.087
I thank y'all for being here.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.005
I'm aware that many of you

23:52.080 --> 23:54.208
think I'm a stranger
in your land.

23:55.440 --> 23:57.283
Maybe some of you
heard me on the radio

23:57.360 --> 24:00.284
offering my own
hard-earned money

24:00.360 --> 24:02.488
for the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.170
Or maybe I contacted you

24:05.240 --> 24:07.720
with a generous offer
for your property,

24:09.200 --> 24:12.363
the kind of offer that makes
all manner of things possible,

24:13.160 --> 24:16.448
things maybe you hadn't even
gotten around to dreaming of.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.811
But I didn't come here just to
make us all a lot of money,

24:20.640 --> 24:22.722
though I intend to do that.

24:23.080 --> 24:26.971
And I didn't come here to
reverse this town's fortunes,

24:27.800 --> 24:29.609
save it from falling prey

24:29.680 --> 24:32.604
to the ghosts that dwell
in these streets and hollers.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.727
Truth is, I came
back here for love.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.642
I hope you all come and say
hello to my lovely fiancée,

24:39.720 --> 24:40.767
Miss Katherine.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.121
Speaking of ghosts who've
haunted these streets,

24:46.200 --> 24:48.248
I see Boyd Crowder's
in our midst.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.847
Don't suppose you've come to
cast aspersion on my motivations

24:52.920 --> 24:55.287
in front of these fine people, Mr.
Crowder.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.486
Oh, not at all, Mr. Markham.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.324
You throw a hell of a party.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.765
I'm enjoying myself immensely.

25:00.680 --> 25:02.808
Although I am curious,

25:02.880 --> 25:06.009
do you plan on doing
to this small town

25:07.240 --> 25:08.366
the same thing that you did

25:08.440 --> 25:10.966
to all those other small
towns in Colorado?

25:11.960 --> 25:15.442
Everybody knows I think
dope is a fine commodity,

25:15.520 --> 25:17.363
legal or otherwise.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.124
But the people in this room

25:19.800 --> 25:22.883
need the money earned
in their community

25:23.000 --> 25:25.651
to stay in their community.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.770
I don't claim to be a savior.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.485
But I have already
demonstrated my willingness

25:31.560 --> 25:34.404
to put my money to
work in this community.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.970
And as I understand it,

25:36.760 --> 25:39.445
where I offered cash,
you offered threats.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.411
That your plan?

25:41.640 --> 25:44.166
Keep harming these good
people for your own gain?

25:44.320 --> 25:46.527
Far as I know,
everyone Boyd spoke to

25:46.600 --> 25:47.931
is at least still alive.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.962
Unlike Betty
and John-O Hutchins.

25:53.160 --> 25:58.200
And I don't think I see Red
Crowell at this shindig, either.

25:59.560 --> 26:00.641
Huh.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.201
Maybe your pizza oven
scared him away.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.763
Heard tell he's
skittish around fire

26:05.840 --> 26:07.410
since his place
burned to the ground...

26:08.640 --> 26:11.610
Property you now own,
if I ain't mistaken.

26:11.680 --> 26:15.082
I'm afraid teenage gossip's
clouded your mind, Miss McCready.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.366
Well, could be.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.326
I am still a touch spooked

26:18.400 --> 26:20.448
by the decapitated snake
you put in my house.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.646
See you pointing fingers,

26:21.720 --> 26:24.610
but not offering a fix any to
any of these people's problems.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.967
My fix is the same
as yours, Mr. Markham,

26:27.040 --> 26:28.246
promise of legal weed.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.529
But the difference is, I've
been here for generations.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.330
You all knew my daddy.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.205
You all know me.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.530
Know that I'm Harlan
through and through.

26:41.520 --> 26:43.284
And so is my partner.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.964
And who might that be?

26:45.080 --> 26:48.607
The only other soul I know who cares
about this place as much as I do.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.720
Boyd Crowder.

26:55.840 --> 26:59.401
Every one of you who has been
approached about your property,

26:59.480 --> 27:00.891
this is my offer.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.686
I will give you cash for
your land, same as Markham,

27:03.760 --> 27:06.923
but the difference is I don't
want to move you guys out.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.048
Just want to move some seed in.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.485
And along with that seed,

27:10.560 --> 27:14.326
we bring security and protection
now and in perpetuity.

27:15.920 --> 27:18.651
Hire the locals to help
with the farming,

27:18.720 --> 27:19.767
- pay it back.
- Yeah.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.567
You think Avery Markham
and his city mousette

27:22.640 --> 27:24.369
ain't gonna cut and run,
win or lose?

27:24.440 --> 27:27.046
She look like Harlan to you?

27:27.880 --> 27:29.245
- No.
- No.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.481
Throw in with me,

27:30.560 --> 27:32.130
and we'll make Harlan prosperous

27:32.200 --> 27:33.645
our own selves.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.449
Give this county
back to the people

27:35.520 --> 27:37.090
the way we all know
it should be!

27:48.520 --> 27:50.249
Like she said,
you know her daddy.

27:51.440 --> 27:52.930
Thank you, Ray.

27:54.760 --> 27:55.841
Hey.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.763
I see subtlety
ain't your strong suit.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.365
Said yourself your boys
would offer protection.

27:59.440 --> 28:00.601
I was just making it known.

28:00.680 --> 28:01.886
You ever heard that a whisper

28:01.960 --> 28:03.880
will get you a hell of a
lot further than a roar?

28:03.920 --> 28:05.684
That's how politics
works, Loretta.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.444
Public, private,
it don't matter.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.524
Like you said, can't leave
Harlan to the likes of Markham.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.046
Well, I applaud
your spirit, young lady.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.770
Now, if you will excuse me.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.526
As much as I'd like to stay,

28:17.600 --> 28:19.329
I got to go see a man
about a vault.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.050
You and Earl stand
by for my signal.

28:21.120 --> 28:23.726
Boyd, be careful. I lost
plenty in the mine already.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.962
About time you started
seeing some gains.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.447
You seem displeased, Marshal.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.045
What gave you that idea?

28:35.320 --> 28:36.890
You said to get
protection, and I did.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.200
What you did was align yourself

28:38.320 --> 28:40.482
with a man who's about to
be arrested or killed.

28:41.280 --> 28:43.851
You best hope you're not standing
next to him when that happens.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.251
This mean you're not
gonna sell me your land?

28:45.320 --> 28:47.402
It hasn't occurred to you
that the Marshal Service

28:47.480 --> 28:49.687
may frown upon me
selling my parcel

28:49.760 --> 28:52.127
to anybody associated
with Boyd Crowder?

28:52.200 --> 28:55.488
When the dust settles with
Boyd, maybe you'll reconsider.

29:00.920 --> 29:02.251
Something
will need to be

29:02.320 --> 29:03.731
done about that girl.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.081
Yeah.

29:06.560 --> 29:07.925
Find out if she has any kin.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.084
She ends up with
any of this property,

29:11.160 --> 29:12.605
I want to know where it's going.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.450
You know, except for the filth,

29:22.520 --> 29:24.648
the impending sense
of being buried alive,

29:24.720 --> 29:26.006
and the smell of rotten flesh,

29:26.080 --> 29:27.241
it's not that bad down here.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.761
Yeah. Try doing it 10 hours
a day, 6 days a week.

29:29.840 --> 29:30.887
What is that?

29:31.720 --> 29:33.882
That is Uncle Zachariah.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.080
Lovely.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.366
You seen enough,

29:37.440 --> 29:38.965
or you want to venture
on down into the depths,

29:39.040 --> 29:40.121
get a front row seat
for the show?

29:40.200 --> 29:42.521
If it's all the same to you,
I'll, uh, wait right here.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.364
Carl!

29:46.040 --> 29:48.361
Make sure to keep
your radio on channel 2.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.522
I'll holler when we all set.
All right.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.847
Get ready for the boom! Whoo!

29:56.560 --> 29:57.891
Nice shoes.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.848
Earl, why don't you
go out for a smoke?

30:12.960 --> 30:13.961
I don't smoke.

30:14.560 --> 30:15.766
Well, you should take it up.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.405
It'd be good for your health.

30:17.960 --> 30:19.291
Maybe you should suck...

30:19.360 --> 30:20.566
For Christ's sakes, Earl.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.210
Just give us a minute

30:22.400 --> 30:24.368
before he crushes
your nuts again,

30:24.440 --> 30:26.920
tosses you in a cell
just because he can.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.365
I'm gonna take a piss,

30:28.440 --> 30:30.727
and when I get back,
you're gonna be gone.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.645
Think you hurt his feelings.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.006
He won't be gone long.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.242
Whatever it is you want,
you best get to it.

30:43.560 --> 30:46.245
I just wanted to tell you how
good you look in that dress.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.769
Thought it was
supposed to be a party.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.609
I feel a little overdressed.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.531
Ain't nobody complaining.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.930
You know, don't you?

31:15.720 --> 31:18.121
I'm supposed to tell you
it's gonna happen next week,

31:18.200 --> 31:19.964
but it's going down today.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.521
Soon.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.366
How'd you figure it?

31:28.800 --> 31:30.484
Something in your way.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.611
He almost killed me.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.804
What are you supposed to do now?

31:39.880 --> 31:42.008
Start a fire,
clear this place out.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.525
Best get to it.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.041
That looks pretty damn
good, Uncle Zachariah.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.929
What'd you think?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.525
Son, I've been
doing this long before

32:04.600 --> 32:06.250
you ever heard the
word "nitroglycerine."

32:09.520 --> 32:10.601
Phew!

32:10.720 --> 32:14.327
That money's gonna fall right
down in my goddamn lap.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.563
You kiss my ass, Raylan Givens!

32:19.200 --> 32:20.690
Whoo!

32:30.120 --> 32:31.770
Carl, you got me?

32:33.440 --> 32:35.204
<i>Yeah, I got you.</i>

32:36.040 --> 32:37.644
Tell them to pull
that alarm, son.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.041
<i>We all set down here.</i>

32:46.120 --> 32:47.201
Time to boogie.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.125
We need to get to your vault.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.610
I believe you're being robbed.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.888
Whoo-hoo!

33:53.960 --> 33:56.531
"I am at rest,
you need not fear,

33:56.600 --> 33:58.762
"no anxious sorrow
need not take."

34:11.520 --> 34:12.567
Ain't no way my niece

34:12.639 --> 34:14.768
spending one more goddamn
minute with a Crowder.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.888
You're gonna be buried
by your own goddamn greed,

34:16.960 --> 34:18.246
just like you deserve.

34:18.520 --> 34:19.965
Burn in hell,
you son of a bitch.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.886
Zachariah!

34:30.920 --> 34:32.159
Help me!

34:42.520 --> 34:43.931
Oh!

34:51.239 --> 34:52.525
Help!

34:57.360 --> 34:58.646
Come on.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.605
Help!

35:00.680 --> 35:01.806
Boyd?

35:02.240 --> 35:03.924
- Help me!
- Boyd!

35:07.840 --> 35:08.841
Help!

35:17.920 --> 35:19.285
Help!

35:23.160 --> 35:24.286
Boyd!

35:24.800 --> 35:26.006
Carl!
Boyd!

35:26.080 --> 35:27.286
Here!
What happened?

35:27.360 --> 35:28.930
Give me the rock hammer!

35:29.000 --> 35:30.161
Where's Zachariah?

35:30.240 --> 35:31.890
Get out! Go!

35:31.960 --> 35:33.086
Christ!

36:12.800 --> 36:14.404
All right,
I see Boyd, Duffy.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.244
We can all see Duffy.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.766
And Carl.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.765
And no money.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.771
Whatever that blast
was, it wasn't enough.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.682
One thing that
didn't occur to me

36:36.760 --> 36:39.001
dipshit's not capable
of pulling it off.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.606
What if he had?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.286
What if he, uh,
stuck his head up

36:44.360 --> 36:45.850
out of a hole in there?

36:45.960 --> 36:47.041
You gonna shoot him?

36:47.440 --> 36:48.726
Might've.

36:48.960 --> 36:50.041
Let's give him a minute.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.531
Maybe he'll try it again.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.520
What's gonna happen next is,

36:57.600 --> 37:00.126
fire department's
gonna come down here

37:00.200 --> 37:01.486
and kick our asses out.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.761
Yep.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.365
Getting smoky in here.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.642
You know, I don't get you.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.440
Give you some of my own
money to help you out.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.729
24 hours ago upstairs,

37:17.800 --> 37:20.724
I figured you and me
are simpatico.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.408
I see you're just
jerking me around

37:24.480 --> 37:26.289
and using me to get Boyd.

37:26.360 --> 37:27.691
Don't take it personal.

37:27.760 --> 37:29.000
I'm just doing what I got to do.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.087
Yeah. That's my plan.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.531
What's that?

37:35.560 --> 37:36.971
Doing what I got to do.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.010
Care to elaborate?

37:40.760 --> 37:43.730
Right now, I'm gonna get out of
here and get some fresh air...

37:46.920 --> 37:49.207
...find my fiancée.

37:56.680 --> 37:57.680
What happened?

37:57.720 --> 37:59.324
Where's everyone?
Where's the money?

38:03.520 --> 38:04.681
Get out.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.882
Get your ass back to the Portal!

38:06.960 --> 38:08.530
You see anything
looks like that money

38:08.640 --> 38:10.085
leaving that place,
you call me immediately.

38:10.160 --> 38:11.924
Get out. Get out!

38:14.760 --> 38:16.728
What did you say
to your goddamn uncle?

38:16.800 --> 38:17.926
What did you say to your uncle?

38:18.000 --> 38:19.570
- Nothing!
- Don't you lie to me.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.643
Wasn't it enough
to put me in jail?

38:21.720 --> 38:22.960
You trying to kill me now?
Is that it?

38:23.040 --> 38:24.644
What the hell
are you talking about?

38:24.720 --> 38:26.404
Your uncle tried to blow me up!

38:27.120 --> 38:28.485
You give him the idea?

38:28.560 --> 38:29.561
How can you say that?

38:29.640 --> 38:31.560
I'm the one told you he
wasn't right in the head!

38:31.720 --> 38:33.529
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.290
You lying to me?

38:39.400 --> 38:40.561
No.

39:00.760 --> 39:01.886
Boyd?

39:04.720 --> 39:06.290
Is Zachariah dead?

39:09.040 --> 39:10.565
I don't know, Ava.

39:13.680 --> 39:14.681
And the money?

39:14.760 --> 39:15.886
Still in the vault.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.126
It won't be for long. They're
gonna move it tonight.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.280
And that's when
I'm gonna hit it.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.561
You want to tell me exactly
what went wrong down there?

39:43.640 --> 39:45.210
Yeah.
Boyd couldn't get it up.

39:45.320 --> 39:46.526
You being cute?
No, Chief.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.647
I'm just answering the question.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.206
Our office has devoted
copious hours and resources

39:50.280 --> 39:51.645
to this case that,
as of right now,

39:51.720 --> 39:53.290
hasn't produced a goddamn thing.

39:53.360 --> 39:54.885
Hey, no one's trying
to make you look bad here.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.291
I put you in the lead
of this to remove

39:56.360 --> 39:57.725
Boyd from the
civilian population,

39:57.800 --> 39:59.165
and what do we have
to show for it?

39:59.240 --> 40:01.242
Not to repeat myself, jack shit.

40:01.320 --> 40:03.163
That ain't true.
We still got Ava.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.924
We got Duffy now, too.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.729
Boyd, Markham,
the rest of them assholes,

40:06.840 --> 40:08.365
they're just doing
what we want them to do.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.568
Now, hey, I ain't saying
we're in the end zone

40:10.640 --> 40:13.166
doing the Ickey Shuffle, but we
are definitely in the red zone.

40:13.240 --> 40:14.651
What the hell
is the Ickey Shuffle?

40:14.720 --> 40:16.404
Boyd ain't gonna stop.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.723
He's just gonna go at that
money harder and stupider.

40:19.800 --> 40:22.087
Not that I wouldn't like to
stay completely out of this,

40:22.160 --> 40:24.040
but how exactly do you
think he's gonna do that?

40:24.160 --> 40:26.003
Well, Markham's
gonna move that cash.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.730
Boyd's gonna
be there when he does.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.131
And to think there was a time

40:29.200 --> 40:31.771
I was actually excited about
having the big office.
