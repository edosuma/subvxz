WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.833
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.708 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I gotta be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.208
Winnie the Pooh

01:12.708 --> 01:15.250
Oh, I love
Spring cleaning.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.083
Out with the old--

01:17.083 --> 01:19.708
Where did I get
this bent stick?

01:23.375 --> 01:25.000
All done.

01:33.583 --> 01:34.833
Hiya, Rabbit.

01:34.833 --> 01:37.000
Consider yourself bounced.

01:38.583 --> 01:41.291
How lucky can I get?

01:41.291 --> 01:42.833
Whoo.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:42.833 --> 01:44.958
You ought to
clean up this place,
bunny boy.

01:44.958 --> 01:46.583
I was.

01:46.583 --> 01:48.583
Ooh-hoo-hoo,
let me help.

01:48.583 --> 01:49.875
No, no, no!
I'll do it my--

01:51.083 --> 01:52.333
Self.

01:52.333 --> 01:55.333
Say, what you gonna do
with all this stuff?

01:55.333 --> 01:57.125
I'm taking it to the dump.

01:57.125 --> 02:00.125
Woo-hoo!
What a great stickeroo.

02:00.125 --> 02:02.166
Are you really gonna
throw it out?

02:03.458 --> 02:06.458
Actually, I was gonna
give it to you.

02:06.458 --> 02:09.625
Nice of you to drop by,
Tigger. Bye-bye.

02:10.708 --> 02:11.958
Whew.

02:11.958 --> 02:15.500
Every time he helps,
I end up in a mess.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.000
Ooh, uh--
Almost forgot.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.458
Uh, here's that book
I borrowed.

02:19.458 --> 02:21.708
Thanks, Rabbit.

02:21.708 --> 02:24.208
Uh, you're welcome.

02:24.208 --> 02:25.375
Did you like it?

02:25.375 --> 02:27.375
No. Not enough pictures.

02:27.375 --> 02:28.625
Of course.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.125
No, not again.

02:32.125 --> 02:35.458
Not a very good bookend
you have there.

02:35.458 --> 02:38.166
I'll have you know,
it's a--

02:38.166 --> 02:40.833
it's a wonderful bookend.

02:40.833 --> 02:43.125
It's a beautiful bookend.

02:43.125 --> 02:44.708
It's-- it's, uh--

02:44.708 --> 02:46.500
Well,
it's all by itself.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.333
Uh, you need two,
long ears,

02:48.333 --> 02:50.208
or your books
will never stay up.

02:50.208 --> 02:52.458
I know.

02:52.458 --> 02:54.291
I've looked everywhere
for its mate.

02:56.958 --> 02:59.000
No, you're right,
Tigger.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.416
Without the other bookend,
this one's no good to me.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.708
I might as well...

03:05.708 --> 03:06.708
get rid of it.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.708
Goodbye, old bunny.

03:14.708 --> 03:16.708
I wish I could have
found your mate.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.250
Ooh, look at
all this stuff.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.708
Wow, snow shoes.

03:40.208 --> 03:41.750
What a neat bunny.

03:41.750 --> 03:43.625
And I don't even
have to feed him.

03:45.083 --> 03:47.458
There.

03:47.458 --> 03:49.291
Roo: Hi, Piglet.

03:49.291 --> 03:52.000
Uh, do you think
it'll snow soon?

03:54.375 --> 03:56.708
It's the beginning
of Spring, Roo.

03:56.708 --> 04:00.083
Ah, I want to try
my new snow shoes.

04:00.083 --> 04:02.708
Roo, those are
tennis rackets.

04:02.708 --> 04:05.000
They are?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.500
Ah, I don't even have
a tennis ball.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.250
Oh, boy.

04:12.250 --> 04:15.000
Trade you my bunny
for your ball.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.875
I'd be glad to,
Roo, but...

04:16.875 --> 04:19.250
whatever am I gonna do
with this?

04:19.250 --> 04:21.875
Oh, since bunnies hop,

04:21.875 --> 04:24.166
I'll give this to
my very good friend, Pooh,

04:24.166 --> 04:25.458
as a-- as a--

04:25.458 --> 04:27.166
Spring present.

04:28.875 --> 04:33.125
Why, thank you, Piglet.

04:33.125 --> 04:35.083
It's perfect.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.125
What is it?

04:36.125 --> 04:37.625
Oh, it's a bookend.

04:37.625 --> 04:40.250
When you have two of them,
they hold things up.

04:40.250 --> 04:43.291
She looks lonely.

04:43.291 --> 04:44.875
I know.

04:44.875 --> 04:46.958
Since she's all alone,

04:46.958 --> 04:48.833
we'll hold her up.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.875
Bye, Piglet.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.166
And thank you.

04:54.166 --> 04:55.750
Oh, Rabbit.

04:55.750 --> 04:58.750
Come see my new
honey bunny.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.458
What's a honey bunny?

05:00.458 --> 05:03.250
That's the mate
to my bookend.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.458
Pooh. Pooh,
I've gotta have it.

05:05.458 --> 05:08.000
Please,
I'll trade you for it.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.291
Honey. Yes.
You can have a jar of
my very best honey.

05:13.291 --> 05:15.458
No, this was a present

05:15.458 --> 05:18.625
from my
very dear friend Piglet.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.000
I can't give it away.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.125
Two jars.

05:22.833 --> 05:24.166
I mustn't.

05:24.166 --> 05:27.166
Three jars.
Four. Five.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.875
Wonderful.
I'll be right back.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.458
One, uh, two,
three, four.

05:41.458 --> 05:45.000
Oh, no.
I don't have five.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.833
I'll get the honey myself.

05:46.833 --> 05:47.875
How hard could it be?

05:47.875 --> 05:49.250
Even Pooh does it.

05:58.875 --> 06:01.875
Obviously, this tree
wasn't built for rabbits.

06:01.875 --> 06:03.208
- Boo.
- Ya-hoo!

06:03.208 --> 06:05.833
Bunny boy.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.000
You-- What's the matter,
long ears?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.500
Oh, Tigger.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.333
I need to get some honey
from that hive.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.708
Oh, never fear,
old buddy.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.083
Gettin' honey is what
Tigger's do best.

06:17.083 --> 06:19.291
I'll just knock that
old honey hive down

06:19.291 --> 06:22.000
with my special stickeroo.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.958
Look out!
We're under attack.

06:30.833 --> 06:34.625
Oh. Who wants an old
bent stick, anyway?

06:36.125 --> 06:38.250
Are you sure
this'll work?

06:38.250 --> 06:40.208
Don't worry,
fluffy tail.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.291
When's old Tigger
ever let you down?

06:45.958 --> 06:48.083
Say, Tigger,
you're right.

06:48.083 --> 06:49.583
These work wonderfully.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.583
I-- I feel like a--

06:51.583 --> 06:53.708
Like a graceful bird.

06:53.708 --> 06:54.875
Duck!

06:54.875 --> 06:56.583
No, not a duck.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.708
Like a-- a swan.

06:58.708 --> 07:00.958
No! Duck!

07:02.583 --> 07:05.416
I hope these strings
are double knotted.

07:05.416 --> 07:08.375
Well, of course, they are.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.875
What's a knot?

07:10.875 --> 07:12.708
Tigger!

07:14.416 --> 07:16.416
Gee, hold on, big ears.

07:16.416 --> 07:18.416
I got another idea.

07:18.416 --> 07:21.125
And this one's
a thousand percent safe.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.000
Safe? Well...

07:24.708 --> 07:26.250
Once you're
up in the air,

07:26.250 --> 07:28.291
I'll tow ya straight to
the honey hive

07:28.291 --> 07:29.708
graceful as a bird.

07:29.708 --> 07:31.250
A swan, even.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.000
Yow!

07:42.166 --> 07:45.291
Any more bright ideas?

07:45.291 --> 07:48.333
As a matter of factual--

07:48.333 --> 07:50.166
Yes.

07:50.166 --> 07:53.875
I-- I don't think I want
that honey after all, Tigger.

07:53.875 --> 07:55.875
Oh, come on, bunny boy.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.958
Can't you hear that
old bookend callin'?

07:58.958 --> 08:00.458
Rabbit!

08:00.458 --> 08:02.458
All right, all right.

08:02.458 --> 08:03.750
What do we have to do?

08:09.125 --> 08:12.458
Now all you have to do
is swing up to the hive.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.458
Uh, but first, duck!

08:22.375 --> 08:23.833
Not bad, Tigger.

08:23.833 --> 08:25.458
But the rope's too short.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.083
Oh, that's easy.

08:27.083 --> 08:29.333
All we gotta do is
add some more rope.

08:39.750 --> 08:43.833
No. I'm not doing
any more of your
crazy stunts.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.583
Oh, don't worry.

08:45.583 --> 08:48.166
I'll handle all
the dangerous stuff
this time.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.166
Yai-ee!

08:57.166 --> 08:59.000
Don't touch me!

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Woo-ooh!
Just forget it.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.708
I'll never get that hive.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.500
I did it!
Woo-hoo.

09:32.500 --> 09:35.750
That bunny bookend is
practically on my shelf.

09:37.583 --> 09:39.416
The honey's mine,

09:39.416 --> 09:41.875
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.208
- Tigger: Duck!
-

09:48.500 --> 09:50.875
Don't show 'em any fear,
bunny boy.

09:50.875 --> 09:52.291
They can sense it.

09:52.291 --> 09:53.583
-

09:59.708 --> 10:01.416
Here you go, Pooh.

10:01.416 --> 10:04.625
Five jars of honey,
as we agreed.

10:04.625 --> 10:08.166
Oh, my.
Thank you, Rabbit.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.583
I hope it wasn't
too much trouble.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.958
Oh, yes.
The bunny.

10:15.458 --> 10:17.291
Here you are, Rabbit.

10:17.291 --> 10:20.000
At last, I finally have
the other bookend.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.333
Now all I have to do is
go to the dump,

10:23.333 --> 10:25.000
and get my old one back.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.416
Look, Piglet.

10:26.416 --> 10:28.333
There's the bunny
I gave you.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.958
What?
Oh, no.

10:29.958 --> 10:31.583
You mean,
you got this bunny?

10:31.583 --> 10:33.416
Yep. From the dump.

10:33.416 --> 10:35.125
The dump!
You got it from the--

10:35.125 --> 10:36.583
That means...

10:36.583 --> 10:39.250
I've been chasing after
my own bookend.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.166
All the time.

10:43.625 --> 10:46.166
Oh, no.

10:46.166 --> 10:47.208
Rabbit.

10:49.208 --> 10:50.958
- Watch out for the--
- Rabbit, look out!

10:59.166 --> 11:01.458
Ahh, come in.

11:04.875 --> 11:07.750
Well, go on, Pooh.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.875
Uh, Rabbit,
we thought that

11:09.875 --> 11:13.333
since the bunny bookend
meant so much to you,

11:13.333 --> 11:15.333
we'd make you a mate.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.250
A mate?

11:17.250 --> 11:21.166
Well, uh,
thank you, Pooh.

11:21.166 --> 11:23.583
Thank you,
everybody.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Tigger: Duck!

11:33.083 --> 11:34.375
Rabbit: Tigger!

11:48.583 --> 11:51.833
Ee, oo-ee, ee,
ch-choo!

11:59.708 --> 12:01.708
I'm sorry, Papa.

12:01.708 --> 12:03.333
I'm sorry.

12:03.333 --> 12:06.583
I know you're
allergic to me goofin' up.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.708
It's perfectly all right,
oh, sweet son of mine.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.291
We'll try it one more time.

12:16.708 --> 12:19.875
Now, do you remember
your three Ts?

12:19.875 --> 12:21.291
Sure, Papa.

12:21.291 --> 12:24.083
Trackin', trappin',
and-- and--

12:24.083 --> 12:25.958
Trashin', son.

12:25.958 --> 12:28.458
Trashin' them furry
woodland creatures.

12:28.458 --> 12:32.583
The T-n-T's,
passed down from
father heffalump

12:32.583 --> 12:34.500
to son heffalump.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.375
And the first T is...

12:36.375 --> 12:37.708
trappin'.

12:42.708 --> 12:45.500
Now, dramatically
spring the trap.

12:50.208 --> 12:52.416
Oh, come on, son.

12:52.416 --> 12:55.875
Put a little more
heffalump oomp into it.

13:01.166 --> 13:04.625
I'll be right back.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.583
Papa, I didn't
mean to do it.

13:13.583 --> 13:14.625
I'm sorry.

13:14.625 --> 13:18.291
Listen, son, uh,

13:18.291 --> 13:20.125
why don't you go
practice some trackin'

13:20.125 --> 13:21.333
while I, uh--

13:21.333 --> 13:24.250
Inspect the rest of
this trap.

13:24.250 --> 13:25.750
Uh, yeah, that's it,
I'll, uh--

13:25.750 --> 13:27.500
Yes, Papa.

13:34.458 --> 13:36.125
Pooh:
Ya-ha-ha-hoo!

13:36.125 --> 13:38.375
- Piglet: Whee!
- Pooh: Whoa.

13:40.583 --> 13:42.750
You were right, Pooh.

13:42.750 --> 13:45.000
That wasn't so very hard.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.750
That's because
I'm so very soft.

13:48.750 --> 13:51.375
Shall we do it again?

13:52.708 --> 13:56.375
Ah, what's that,
P-P-P-Pooh?

13:56.375 --> 14:00.500
It sounds to me
like a crying jag.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.208
That's short
for jagular.

14:03.208 --> 14:05.166
Oh, dear.

14:05.166 --> 14:08.083
Is that one of
the fiercer animals?

14:08.083 --> 14:10.166
I'm not sure, Piglet.

14:10.166 --> 14:12.125
But perhaps
if we ignore it,

14:12.125 --> 14:13.416
it will go away.

14:15.416 --> 14:18.833
But, Pooh,
it sounds so sad.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.500
Then we'll help.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.875
Uh, good idea,
Pooh, uh--

14:24.875 --> 14:26.416
Waaaaah!

14:26.416 --> 14:28.000
Uh, you-- you help first.

14:31.458 --> 14:33.416
It's not a jagular,
Pooh.

14:33.416 --> 14:35.000
It's Junior Heffalump.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Piglet!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.708
Aww. Why are you crying?

14:38.708 --> 14:41.500
I can't find any tracks,

14:41.500 --> 14:43.208
and if I can't find tracks,

14:43.208 --> 14:47.166
I won't be able to find
any other Ts.

14:47.166 --> 14:50.000
And if I don't learn my Ts,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.291
I'll let my papa down.

14:53.291 --> 14:54.708
Ts?

14:54.708 --> 14:58.250
All I know about Ts
is tea parties,

14:58.250 --> 15:01.125
and that honey
is served at them.

15:01.125 --> 15:03.375
Perhaps we should
take you to Rabbit's.

15:03.375 --> 15:05.416
He's an expert
at tea parties.

15:05.416 --> 15:06.875
And honey.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.875
Junior!

15:16.750 --> 15:17.958
Tracks.

15:17.958 --> 15:21.875
Gasp!
Heffalump nappers.

15:21.875 --> 15:26.708
They must have snatched
my baby boy.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.083
But I'll track 'em down.

15:35.125 --> 15:37.583
Mm. Tea time.

15:38.875 --> 15:41.416
Now who could that be?

15:41.416 --> 15:43.291
As if I didn't know.

15:44.833 --> 15:47.750
Hello, Rabbit.
This is Junior.

15:47.750 --> 15:50.291
And we've come for tea,

15:50.291 --> 15:51.958
and tea,

15:51.958 --> 15:53.875
and honey.

15:53.875 --> 15:56.333
But he's a heffalump.

15:56.333 --> 15:59.875
And he has to learn
everything there is to know
about Ts.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.416
So we'd better get started.

16:02.416 --> 16:05.458
Rabbit: All right.
Just be--

16:06.500 --> 16:08.125
Careful.

16:10.708 --> 16:13.375
Hmm.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.875
That has to be
a heffalump napper.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.875
Only that many feet
could have left
so many tracks.

16:23.458 --> 16:25.000
'Scuse me,

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
but you're sittin' on
a thistle bush.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Thistle bush?

16:31.333 --> 16:34.000
Didn't need to leave
in such a huff.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.875
I said excuse me.

16:39.208 --> 16:42.166
What else can possibly
go wrong?

16:45.875 --> 16:48.291
I had to ask.

16:48.291 --> 16:49.708
Oooh!

16:49.708 --> 16:52.375
- Yeow!

16:52.375 --> 16:54.583
Oh, bother.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.416
Junior. Come on, boy.
Let's get outta here.

17:07.833 --> 17:09.458
A ghost.

17:09.458 --> 17:13.416
Junior's been kidnapped
by  a ghost.

17:13.416 --> 17:16.375
Junior, tell me.
What happened back there,
son?

17:16.375 --> 17:19.250
Well, you see, Papa,
we were having a tea party.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.333
Me and my friends were--

17:20.333 --> 17:22.333
No time to talk now.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.833
This is our chance to trap

17:23.833 --> 17:25.708
some of those furry
woodland creatures.

17:25.708 --> 17:27.458
But, Papa,

17:27.458 --> 17:30.583
aren't you allergic to
furry woodland creatures?

17:31.708 --> 17:33.000
Oh, yeah.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.416
Ah-choo!

17:38.166 --> 17:40.083
But we have to
save him.

17:40.083 --> 17:41.083
Ooh!

17:47.000 --> 17:49.125
- Rabbit: We found him.
- But-- but--

17:49.125 --> 17:50.583
Not now.

17:50.583 --> 17:51.958
You can thank us
when you're safe.

17:52.958 --> 17:55.416
Oh. We can hide down there.

17:56.458 --> 17:59.750
Gasp! How can it be?

17:59.750 --> 18:02.083
My son's in the clutches

18:02.083 --> 18:03.583
of the furry
woodland creatures.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.875
Oh. Where are we?

18:13.750 --> 18:16.958
Smack dab where you
ain't been invited, sonny.

18:16.958 --> 18:19.833
Confound nuisances,
droppin' in at all hours.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.375
So, what do you want?

18:22.375 --> 18:25.083
Uh, you see, Gopher,

18:25.083 --> 18:27.291
uh, we're hiding
from a ghost

18:27.291 --> 18:29.291
that keeps chasing Junior.

18:29.291 --> 18:32.833
Well, he's not exactly
a ghost.

18:32.833 --> 18:36.083
You see, I'm supposed to
learn my T-n-Ts,

18:36.083 --> 18:37.291
- and--
- T-n-T?

18:37.291 --> 18:40.458
Well, sonny,

18:40.458 --> 18:43.000
ya come to
the right place.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.250
Course, uh,
we can only start you out
with a half dozen sticks.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.958
After all,
you're just a beginner.

18:47.958 --> 18:50.375
All I need is
a running start.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.000
Oh, no.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.583
I forgot.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.458
I'm allergic to holes, too.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.833
Now listen, sonny,

19:05.833 --> 19:08.125
- there's nothin' to this.
- But-- but--

19:08.125 --> 19:09.500
Ahh--

19:09.500 --> 19:11.208
Ah, don't be nervous.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.583
First time's
always the hardest.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.333
- Choo!
-

19:15.333 --> 19:16.833
Gesundheit.

19:16.833 --> 19:18.166
That's odd.

19:18.166 --> 19:19.875
I've never said
gesundheit

19:19.875 --> 19:21.583
to an explosion before.

19:21.583 --> 19:25.708
That was no explosion.

19:25.708 --> 19:28.375
That was my papa.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.208
Must be
more allergic to holes
than I thought.

19:31.208 --> 19:33.125
There, there.

19:33.125 --> 19:35.291
Your father
will understand you
blowing him up.

19:35.291 --> 19:38.583
No, I've let him down.

19:38.583 --> 19:41.750
It's not that I'm a bad son,

19:41.750 --> 19:45.583
I'm just not
a very good heffalump.

19:45.583 --> 19:50.000
I can't even track
furry woodland creatures.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.708
- Pooh, we have to
do something.

19:52.708 --> 19:55.416
I got it.
Nitroglycerin.

19:55.416 --> 19:57.250
Don't worry, Piglet.

19:57.250 --> 19:59.083
I have a fool proof plan.

20:00.083 --> 20:03.708
Oh, my son.
My son!

20:03.708 --> 20:05.875
What have they done
with you?

20:05.875 --> 20:09.583
I've failed him as a father!

20:09.583 --> 20:11.375
Uh, Papa.

20:11.375 --> 20:13.000
Not now, son.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.958
I'm busy
bein' worried about ya.

20:16.708 --> 20:18.833
- Son?
- Hi.

20:18.833 --> 20:20.708
Son!

20:22.625 --> 20:25.583
Oh, it's good
to have you back, boy.

20:27.750 --> 20:30.875
Hey, wait a minute.

20:30.875 --> 20:32.375
Where have you been?

20:32.375 --> 20:35.375
I've been trackin', Papa.

20:35.375 --> 20:36.416
Look.

20:41.416 --> 20:43.708
Hello.
- Hi.

20:43.708 --> 20:46.416
We've been tracked.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.500
Ya did it, son!

20:48.500 --> 20:49.958
Your first track.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.958
I--

20:51.958 --> 20:54.458
Say, they look
kind of familiar.

20:54.458 --> 20:56.958
Ah, who cares.

20:56.958 --> 20:58.750
Just pull that lever, son,

20:58.750 --> 21:00.875
and ya got 'em trapped.

21:00.875 --> 21:01.958
Both: Trapped?

21:01.958 --> 21:03.333
But, Papa--

21:03.333 --> 21:05.583
Remember, T-n-T.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.583
Now pull that lever.

21:13.958 --> 21:15.625
Hey!

21:16.833 --> 21:18.708
Oh, no!

21:18.708 --> 21:21.875
Papa! Oh, Papa,
I'm sorry.

21:21.875 --> 21:23.291
My own boy.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.583
Who'd have believed it?

21:25.583 --> 21:28.291
Do you know
what you've done, Junior?

21:28.291 --> 21:30.000
Goofed again.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.416
You've trapped me,
the teacher.

21:33.416 --> 21:35.125
And to think I taught him
everything he knows.

21:36.416 --> 21:39.583
Take me home, son.

21:39.583 --> 21:41.000
Wait 'til your mama
sees this.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.500
Thanks for everything,
guys.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.458
I'll be back real soon

21:46.458 --> 21:48.583
for a real tea party.

21:48.583 --> 21:50.125
Bye,

21:50.125 --> 21:52.291
little woodland creatures.

21:52.291 --> 21:54.458
Uh-oh.
Woodland creatures.

21:56.291 --> 21:59.000
It's like I always say,
Piglet.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.875
The family that traps
together... uh--

22:01.875 --> 22:03.750
Ah-choo!

22:03.750 --> 22:05.291
Traps together.

22:05.291 --> 22:08.125
Oh, yes, Pooh.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.833
You always do say that.
