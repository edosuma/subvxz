WEBVTT

00:08.550 --> 00:09.926
This is so exciting.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.303
Oh! Our first computer.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.805
I feel like Captain Kirk.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.348
Oh.

00:15.432 --> 00:18.393
And, Ozzie, you are a doll
for helping us set it up.

00:18.476 --> 00:20.520
I don't understand why we need that thing.

00:20.603 --> 00:22.355
It is the future, Red.

00:22.439 --> 00:25.358
One of us has to stay hip
and current with the times.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.276
Oh, look.

00:26.359 --> 00:29.529
It comes with a little foot pedal
like my sewing machine.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.073
No, that's the mouse.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.408
Oh.

00:33.491 --> 00:34.868
What does a mouse do?

00:34.951 --> 00:36.619
It craps in your attic.

00:37.787 --> 00:38.955
Lighten up, Red.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.791
America is going online.
Let's do our part.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.920
Now we can read about
current events, sports, politics.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.589
I do that already.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.674
It's called a newspaper.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.719
And you know what I love about this?

00:53.219 --> 00:56.306
No wires connected to the government.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.642
Is this thing connected to the government?

01:00.268 --> 01:02.604
Yes, the president can see you right now.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.189
I know you're kidding.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.026
But just in case you're not…

01:08.818 --> 01:11.446
Hi, Bill. Loved you on <i>Arsenio.</i>

01:14.949 --> 01:16.951
Nate, why would you want a used hot tub?

01:17.035 --> 01:19.496
It's gonna be contaminated
with other people's juices.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.206
Yeah.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.249
Until we contaminate it with <i>our </i>juices.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.126
That's so romantic.

01:25.627 --> 01:29.172
It's free, Nik.
The only other free thing is a goat.

01:29.672 --> 01:31.549
I love you, but I am not sharing a goat.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.718
What happens if we break up?
Who gets the goat?

01:34.761 --> 01:38.098
As someone whose parents split up,
you don't wanna force the goat to choose.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.433
Nate, go get your disgusting
used hot tub tomorrow.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.019
We have an appointment
to get our pictures done at Glamour Shots.

01:43.103 --> 01:43.978
Oh, it's cool.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.648
We can rebook Glamour Shots
for when my mustache comes in.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.192
Oh! So in, like, 1990-never.

01:50.151 --> 01:53.154
Shut up, Gwen!
When I drink milk, you can almost see it.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.492
Look, Nik. This hot tub is
first come, first served.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.786
It can't wait.
That's how I lost that giant dog crate.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.871
-You don't have a dog!
-But I might get a goat.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.164
-I'm done.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.168
You never want
to talk about our relationship.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.755
Relationships, right?

02:10.839 --> 02:11.673
Who needs 'em?

02:12.173 --> 02:14.300
So you're okay with us just being friends?

02:14.384 --> 02:16.761
Pfft. Oh yeah, it's great. I love it.

02:17.846 --> 02:18.888
It's so good.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.100
It's so good and fun.

02:25.270 --> 02:28.189
Your move worked.
You short-circuited his boy brain.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.279
It's like he's glitching in a video game.

02:34.821 --> 02:38.867
Okay, Nik, I'm not sitting here anymore,
listening to you not talk to me.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.703
Jay, wanna help me pick up this hot tub?

02:41.786 --> 02:43.371
Sure. What?

02:44.497 --> 02:45.874
Sure. What?

02:47.250 --> 02:48.960
-Bro!
-Yeah, I'm coming.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.802
Taking a break
from old-people computer day?

02:58.761 --> 03:01.389
I tried to explain the virtual desktop
to your grandma.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.057
Then I had to explain the word "virtual."

03:04.225 --> 03:06.728
Then somehow I had to explain a desk.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.230
You really don't have to do this for her.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.857
It's not for her. It's for me.

03:10.940 --> 03:14.652
She's part of a bigger plan.
I want to come out to your grandmother.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.030
Wow. Okay.

03:17.530 --> 03:21.451
I… You seem so confident and self-assured.
I thought everyone knew.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.494
I'm a gay kid
living in small-town Wisconsin.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.789
There are still parking spots
for horses at the courthouse.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.835
The fact that I'm out to anyone is huge.

03:31.419 --> 03:34.088
I can relate. In seventh grade,
it took me a really long time

03:34.172 --> 03:36.925
to tell my parents
I wanted to switch from clarinet to oboe.

03:39.886 --> 03:40.887
But I got there.

03:41.930 --> 03:42.931
And you will too.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.058
Sure.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.602
That's the same.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.230
-<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

04:01.866 --> 04:03.910
<i>Hello, Wisconsin!</i>

04:04.494 --> 04:06.537
So why do you want to come out
to my grandmother?

04:06.621 --> 04:09.249
She's step seven
in my 16-step coming out plan.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.084
I didn't know there were steps.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.711
They're updated every year
at our conference in Palm Springs.

04:15.088 --> 04:15.922
I'm kidding.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.509
I knew that. I know things.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.426
I have a gay friend.

04:21.594 --> 04:22.720
Is it me?

04:23.888 --> 04:25.056
Yes.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.727
As I was saying,
I'm working my way towards the final step,

04:30.228 --> 04:31.354
telling my parents.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.023
I've just completed step six,

04:34.107 --> 04:36.359
coming out to strangers
who I'll never see again.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.404
I'm sorry.
I think you have the wrong number.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.406
Also… I'm gay.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.034
Keep the change. I'm gay.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.917
I'm gaaaaay!

04:55.169 --> 04:56.879
I told him again when I bounced back up.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.968
Next is step seven, coming out
to an adult who I see all the time.

05:02.051 --> 05:03.761
AKA, your grandmother.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.347
That's perfect. She loves you.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.141
All women love me.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.019
What a waste.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.647
But can you feel her out for me?

05:14.731 --> 05:17.150
I just want to make sure
she's the right person for me to tell.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.777
She'll be great.
No one's sweeter than my grandma.

05:19.861 --> 05:23.031
My nana seems sweet
until you try to breastfeed in public.

05:24.615 --> 05:27.118
Then she'll spray perfume in your face
and call you a whore.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.791
There it is!

05:36.919 --> 05:39.547
This is even better than that time
we found that nude beach.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.217
Until we saw
my baseball coach doing lunges.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.888
That's what my life feels like right now.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.932
A sandy, saggy sack.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.434
Bro…

05:51.934 --> 05:55.188
It is really bumming me out
seeing you this down about Leia.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.565
You know what
always makes you feel better?

05:58.066 --> 05:59.776
Vagina hands. Get in here.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.533
-It's so accurate.
-That's what it makes it fun!

06:08.993 --> 06:10.870
Well, now that it's gone, the pain's back.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.790
Hello, boys.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.167
Hello, ma'am. We called about the hot tub.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.335
Oh yes.

06:17.418 --> 06:18.961
I'll be glad to see it go.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.546
It used to be my husband's,

06:20.630 --> 06:23.508
but since he passed away,
I don't use it very much.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.593
Oh. I'm so sorry. How did he die?

06:25.676 --> 06:26.636
He drowned.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.182
-Still want the hot tub?
-Jay.

06:31.265 --> 06:32.892
Oh, he drowned in a lake.

06:32.975 --> 06:33.810
Yes!

06:34.477 --> 06:36.396
I mean, I am so sorry for your loss.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.482
I just… really did not want
a haunted hot tub.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.109
We'll take it.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.694
Now, hold on.
Don't you want to try it out first?

06:48.324 --> 06:50.493
Is it hot enough for you, boys?

06:50.576 --> 06:51.744
Yes, ma'am.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.162
Whose foot is that?

06:53.246 --> 06:55.540
Oh, I love this game.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.432
Kitty, come in here.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.393
What do you need?

07:16.686 --> 07:17.520
It woke up.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.731
Well, that is so cute.

07:20.815 --> 07:24.152
I put it to sleep about an hour ago.
It must be hungry.

07:25.486 --> 07:26.904
Oh.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.198
Now it's dead.

07:30.658 --> 07:31.826
That's okay.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.954
Took him a while to warm up to Eric too.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.666
Hey, Grandma, can I run something by you?

07:38.749 --> 07:41.335
It's kind of sensitive and personal.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.545
Is it teenager stuff?

07:42.628 --> 07:44.464
I've missed this.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.924
Yeah, it's about my friend.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.093
Got it. Your friend. Right.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.971
I've had a lot of these "friend" talks
with Eric.

07:53.097 --> 07:55.641
His "friend" wet the bed.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.811
His "friend" had a crush on a teacher.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.398
His "friend" got a rubber band
stuck on his privates.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.904
Anyway, um…

08:09.822 --> 08:12.700
It's about something that might be
outside of your comfort zone.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.536
Is it drugs?
Because you should tell your friend,

08:15.620 --> 08:17.872
it starts with a beer,
and before you know it,

08:17.955 --> 08:20.416
you're sleeping in the park
hooked on the crank.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.877
It's not drugs.

08:24.086 --> 08:27.298
I can't really say,
but it's… it's a big deal.

08:27.381 --> 08:32.887
And it's scary because,
once you do it, there's no going back.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.389
Got it. Okay.

08:36.224 --> 08:39.894
Well, you tell your friend
that I am ready to talk whenever they are.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.647
Thanks, Grandma. You're the coolest.

08:42.730 --> 08:46.651
That's me. Cool as a cucumber.

08:48.277 --> 08:51.489
Donna, it's Kitty!
Your daughter is about to have sex!

08:58.955 --> 09:02.375
This is weird.
You and I never hang out by ourselves.

09:02.458 --> 09:03.543
Why is that?

09:03.626 --> 09:04.961
It's nothing bad.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.046
I just prefer other people.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.965
Me too.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.842
But your brother
ditched me for that hot tub.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.970
Just be happy he's gonna take a bath.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.515
I'm so bored.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.017
Should we do something?

09:20.518 --> 09:21.435
Together?

09:21.519 --> 09:24.397
-I'm not <i>that</i> desperate.
-Yeah, no, me neither.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.856
We have nothing in common.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.986
Okay, we have
one thing in common.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.029
Totally!

09:33.322 --> 09:34.865
Wait, where's my bracelet?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.493
I don't know. I haven't seen it.

09:40.913 --> 09:41.956
You're fun!

09:43.583 --> 09:44.625
<i>You're </i>fun!

09:45.751 --> 09:47.378
Should we be Funyuns?

09:48.879 --> 09:50.256
Funyuns!

09:54.427 --> 09:56.429
Just click right there,
and you'll be online.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.973
I have butterflies in my stomach

09:59.056 --> 10:02.351
just like when I crack open
a new roll of Saran Wrap.

10:02.435 --> 10:06.105
If you start that off wrong,
the next six months are ruined.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.190
Please, just click it.

10:17.283 --> 10:21.454
Oh, okay, the internet is just
two demons yelling at each other.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.874
-That's actually pretty accurate.
-Yeah.

10:25.875 --> 10:29.378
So, before we continue, there is something
I wanted to talk to you about.

10:29.879 --> 10:30.921
It's, uh…

10:32.006 --> 10:33.090
Are you okay?

10:33.883 --> 10:36.135
You seem nervous?
Did you clog up the toilet?

10:36.218 --> 10:38.763
It's not your fault. We have old pipes.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.392
It's actually about me,
and how I'm different from--

10:43.976 --> 10:44.894
Where is she?

10:44.977 --> 10:47.438
Leia, it's Mom! Get down here!

10:48.689 --> 10:49.565
Leia!

10:52.276 --> 10:53.611
How was your drive?

10:54.111 --> 10:57.740
There was a big traffic jam, so I did
about seven miles on the shoulder.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.659
Mom, what are you doing here?

10:59.742 --> 11:01.160
Is this the boy?

11:01.243 --> 11:03.162
Is this your sex boy?

11:05.831 --> 11:06.666
What?

11:06.749 --> 11:09.877
I told your mom
about your friend and her urges.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.006
I got you condoms, jellies, sponges,

11:14.090 --> 11:15.675
and the ugliest underwear I could find.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.681
-Valium?
-Those are for me.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.226
-Mom, I'm not having sex.

11:26.394 --> 11:30.189
Okay, so then what is this secret
you were telling Grandma about?

11:32.566 --> 11:35.361
Actually, this <i>is</i> about me
wanting to have sex.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.029
With a guy.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.197
In bed.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.534
And, um… other places
where people do that to each other.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.163
You got here just in time.
Her hormones are exploding.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.000
Constantly drawing penises.

11:51.961 --> 11:52.878
She's obsessed!

11:54.880 --> 11:55.965
Shh!

11:56.799 --> 11:58.718
The president can hear you.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.265
Okay, look.

12:04.348 --> 12:07.601
I am proud of you for opening up to us
before you did anything.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.896
-Maybe it's time we have the sex talk.
-We had that talk.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.149
That one was all nay-nays,
nah-nahs, and hoo-hoos.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.859
This time, we're using the real words.

12:19.989 --> 12:20.823
Hey, Funyun.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.367
-Yeah, Funyun?
-What do you want to do now?

12:24.452 --> 12:27.204
Well, there's something
I normally do with Nate,

12:27.288 --> 12:30.166
but I think it'd be
so much more fun with you.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.567
Okay, say it back to me, Leia.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.736
I can't with the real words.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.988
Okay, whatever you're comfortable with.

13:01.572 --> 13:05.367
Once a nay-nay's been in a nah-nah,
it can't go in a hoo-hoo.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.829
Wait, which one was the nay-nay again?
You know what?

13:08.913 --> 13:11.707
Don't put anything
into anything after it's been in anything.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.794
Mom, we really didn't need to go this far.

13:14.877 --> 13:18.047
There's a boy I like, and, yeah,
I've had some thoughts about him.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.633
Like, he's got this one T-shirt
that rides up a little…

13:21.133 --> 13:23.636
I'm jealous, Mom.
I want to be the T-shirt.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.597
Oh, it's happening!

13:26.680 --> 13:29.391
It's not happening.
I haven't even kissed him yet.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.686
Okay, well, have you told him
how you feel?

13:32.770 --> 13:33.604
Sort of.

13:34.271 --> 13:37.399
It's kind of a big mess.
I'm so bad at this.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.151
It runs in the family.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.279
-You too?
-Me? No. Your dad.

13:44.865 --> 13:48.410
But no matter how many times
he messed it all up,

13:49.370 --> 13:52.331
I always found my way back to him…
because he has a good heart.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.501
Just like you.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.921
Wait, so Dad wasn't as smooth
as he says he was.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.299
Let's just say, you're lucky you exist.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.559
I just feel so lost, Marion.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.435
I don't know who I am anymore.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.689
I went through the same thing
when I lost Ralph.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.566
My whole world turned upside down.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.110
I'm so there, Mar.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.321
But you can adapt. You move on.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.574
Life has more surprises waiting for you.

14:27.741 --> 14:28.742
That's deep.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.038
That's basically what I said
but without the dead husband stuff.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.164
Grandma! No!

14:34.248 --> 14:36.584
I told you to stop tricking guys
into your hot tub.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.963
Wha… She didn't do that. We're just
trying it out before we take it.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.591
Bro, I think that's the trick.

14:45.509 --> 14:49.138
I've got a free king-size bed upstairs
if you'd like to try that out.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.265
-It's free?
-Bro!

14:57.062 --> 15:00.065
-Sorry she wasted your time.
-No, it wasn't a waste.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.943
I was getting down on myself,
and she gave me really good advice.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.195
Yeah, she always helps out the cute ones.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.240
I am reporting you to the <i>Pennysaver.</i>

15:08.324 --> 15:09.909
Ooh!

15:14.413 --> 15:18.083
Sorry your big moment
was hijacked by my very chill family.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.294
It's fine.

15:20.377 --> 15:22.880
On the way home, I told a crossing guard,
just to stay sharp.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.884
Okay. Brace yourself for some sap.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.012
Thank you for covering for me yesterday.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.473
You didn't have to do it,
but it really meant a lot.

15:33.474 --> 15:34.516
Of course, Ozzie.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.561
You kind of threw me under the bus
with the penis stuff,

15:37.645 --> 15:39.480
but I'll chalk that up to nerves.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.275
I panicked, and that's
what I was thinking about, so I said it.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.820
All right, Le-Le, I'm out of here.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.907
It's gonna take me twice as long
if I can only use the real lanes.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.242
-Okay, Mom. Love you.
-Love you.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.746
-Nice to meet you, Ozzie.
-You too.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.748
I can see where Leia gets her good looks.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.833
Oh! You're a little charmer.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.211
You sure you aren't gonna have sex?

16:02.294 --> 16:04.046
-Positive.
-A million percent.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.051
Just hit enter
and you'll be signed in to your email.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.722
-<i>You've got mail.</i>
-Oh my God, I've got mail.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.724
Oh! This is thrilling.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.352
I mean, I've had kids,
but this is right up there.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.813
Actually, that's from me.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.525
There's something I've been trying
to tell you, so go ahead and open it.

16:24.608 --> 16:25.693
Oh?

16:25.776 --> 16:26.986
Okay.

16:27.861 --> 16:30.322
Double-click on the little mailbox.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.367
Oh dear.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.285
Where did it go?

16:35.995 --> 16:36.996
It's right there.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.081
Oh.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.332
-Click-click!

16:40.416 --> 16:42.501
No. The little box in the corner.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.837
-The whole thing is gone.
-It's behind there.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.338
-Behind where?
-That window.

16:51.635 --> 16:52.845
Restarting. So…

16:55.014 --> 16:56.473
We have about five minutes.

16:58.892 --> 16:59.893
Forget it.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.229
Mrs. Forman.

17:03.105 --> 17:03.939
I'm gay.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.985
I've known for a while now,
and I wanted you to know.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.738
I even have a boyfriend,
Etienne, who lives in Canada.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.241
Well, I don't know how I feel about this.

17:14.992 --> 17:15.826
Oh.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.371
My friend Sharon married a Canadian man,

17:19.455 --> 17:22.041
and he made off with her Toyota wagon.

17:22.124 --> 17:26.086
And her cat's ashes were in there,
and she is a mess.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.632
But… you're okay with me being gay?

17:30.716 --> 17:32.092
Well, of course I am.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.430
Oh, sweet boy, get in here.

17:39.224 --> 17:42.227
You just made me feel really special.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.696
Is that why you helped me
with the computer?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.532
No, I did it because I loved it.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.755
So… yesterday, huh?

18:10.631 --> 18:11.882
Very unexpected.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.009
Did we…?

18:14.676 --> 18:16.011
Have fun? Yeah.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.554
We did.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.014
Twice.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.601
-Let's never talk about this again.
-Secret dies with me.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.729
Sit here, Nik.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.023
I'm gonna take this lettuce
out to my goat.

18:28.982 --> 18:29.817
You did not.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.860
It was free, Nik!

18:33.070 --> 18:34.822
You're a goat's mommy now.

18:35.447 --> 18:36.824
Okay, that's cute.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.453
So, step seven is in the books.
What's next?

18:41.537 --> 18:42.746
-I steal a car.
-Really?

18:42.830 --> 18:44.540
No, I tell my pediatrician.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.002
Oh God. Jay just walked in.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.796
He's wearing that tiny T-shirt.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.550
Oh my God. He's even hotter
when he's tired.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.761
How long do I keep
this friend thing going?

18:57.845 --> 19:00.347
I don't know. It was your crazy-ass idea.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.183
Just go talk to him.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.434
What am I supposed to do?

19:04.518 --> 19:07.604
Profess my love to him in front of
the ketchup pump? That's so scary.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.607
I just came out to your grandma.
You can tell a guy who knows you like him

19:10.691 --> 19:11.525
that you like him.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.197
-Is that Nikki's scrunchie?
-What?!

19:17.698 --> 19:18.866
No.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.492
Hey.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.119
Hey.

19:22.202 --> 19:25.664
Um, so you know how the other night
I said I just wanted to be friends?

19:25.747 --> 19:28.125
Yeah. That was a surprise,
and not the fun kind.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.962
Well, then you're gonna like
what I'm about to say.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.797
Sorry. It took me forever to park.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.091
Your friend is chasing a goat
around the parking lot

19:36.175 --> 19:37.384
while some girl yells at him.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.971
At least we'll have a story
for our first date.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.017
Oh, Serena, this is my friend Leia.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.185
Howdy, friend!

19:48.729 --> 19:52.107
I was, uh, just getting some ketchup
from the big ol' pump.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.363
Red?

20:01.241 --> 20:02.367
What are you doing?

20:03.577 --> 20:04.536
Uh…

20:04.620 --> 20:06.163
Nothing. Go back to bed.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.249
Red Forman, move your hands.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.007
Is that Raquel Welch?

20:21.929 --> 20:23.722
It is!

20:25.807 --> 20:26.808
Red Forman.

20:28.602 --> 20:32.022
I am so happy
you're using the new computer!

20:33.565 --> 20:35.609
Now, find me one of Kirk Douglas.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.113
-In his gladiator outfit.
-Oh… Okay…

20:41.573 --> 20:42.616
Have at it.

20:46.745 --> 20:47.871
Restarting.
