[whispers] She's gorgeous.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.702
[whispers] I know.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.330
You have always
been lovely, but,

10:21.330 --> 10:23.874
- oh, honey, look at you.
- [laughs]

10:23.874 --> 10:25.792
I think I look
pretty much the same.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.377
You do not look the same at all.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.087
You're growing up.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.341
You're in bloom.

10:32.341 --> 10:34.634
[Belly] Susannah has a way
of saying things

10:34.634 --> 10:36.094
that almost makes me
believe her.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.263
Laur, she's you all over.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.515
- [laughs]
- People always say
I look like my dad.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.726
No, when your mom and I first
met, she looked just like you.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.227
Except I had no boobs at all.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.646
- Gross, Mom.
- [laughs]

10:48.440 --> 10:51.151
You should call your father
and tell him we got in safely.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.819
Uh, why don't you
tell Steven to do it?

10:52.819 --> 10:54.863
Because I'm telling you.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.406
He misses you guys
when you're gone.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.158
Yeah, but he'll see us
at the end of the summer.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.659
No, he'll be here
for the Fourth.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.411
Wait, he's coming here?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.246
Of course.
He always comes for the Fourth.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.748
He didn't come last summer.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.542
[sighs] Because we'd just
gotten divorced.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.877
We're good now.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.171
Where's Mr. Fisher?

11:11.171 --> 11:13.215
Oh, he's in London.

11:13.215 --> 11:15.509
They got him going
back and forth.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.552
He'll join us
later in the summer.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.721
For now, it's just
the women and the children,

11:19.721 --> 11:21.348
- just the way we like it.
- [laughs]

11:38.532 --> 11:40.992
Hi, Junior Mint.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.953
[grunts]

11:42.953 --> 11:45.664
- [both chuckle]
- I can't believe
you still have that bear.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.250
Duh. I would never
throw away Junior Mint.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.836
Come on, let's swim
before dinner, please.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.504
I... I can't.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.714
I-I have to go with my mom
to Whale of a Tale.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.467
Aw, man. I've been wanting
to go in the ocean all day,

11:57.467 --> 11:58.969
but I've been waiting
for you to get here.

12:00.429 --> 12:01.721
Please.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.850
Pretty please. Pretty please!

12:06.226 --> 12:08.728
Yeah, yeah, screw it.
Let's, let's go swim.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.064
Yes. All right,
I'll meet you outside, okay?

12:11.064 --> 12:13.233
Okay, I'll be right down.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.032
I'll be right back.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.617
You going into town?

12:22.617 --> 12:24.202
Oh, Belly and I were gonna go
by Whale of a Tale

12:24.202 --> 12:25.287
so I can sign stock,

12:25.287 --> 12:26.955
but it seems she's
ditched me for the ocean.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.832
Let her play. I'll go with you.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.625
I, uh, just need to drop
by the country club first.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.751
[Laurel] The country club?

12:31.751 --> 12:34.671
Oh, God, never mind.
I'll go by myself.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.798
- I'm going to check on
the catering for your party.
- Catering?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.216
I swear to God, Beck.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.718
You said you were doing
a few bottles of wine

12:39.718 --> 12:40.760
- and that's it.
- [sighs]

12:40.760 --> 12:41.970
It's just a few light appies.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.555
Calm down.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.223
You don't have to
come in the club.

12:45.223 --> 12:46.266
You can wait in the car.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.684
Fine.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.919
Be quick.
If you leave me too long,

13:13.919 --> 13:15.587
I'll get "sunken placed."

13:15.587 --> 13:17.255
[chuckles]

13:21.968 --> 13:23.929
Come on.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.764
Okay, I'm ready.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.435
[laughs]

13:30.435 --> 13:34.064
Hey. Did you know my dad's
coming up for the Fourth?

13:34.064 --> 13:35.732
Cool.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.108
Don't you think it's weird?

13:37.108 --> 13:38.652
Not really. I love your dad.

13:38.652 --> 13:39.986
Yeah, but they've only been
divorced for, like,

13:39.986 --> 13:41.404
a year and a half.

13:41.404 --> 13:42.948
Well, that's what's so
cool about your mom, you know?

13:42.948 --> 13:45.492
- She just doesn't give a shit.
- [chuckles] Exactly.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.952
She doesn't give a shit
because she's the one

13:46.952 --> 13:49.079
who wanted the divorce
in the first place.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.539
I think if you don't want
to be married,

13:50.539 --> 13:52.082
you just shouldn't be married.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.917
Well, tell that to my grandma.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.919
She basically collapsed
when my mom told her.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.462
[chuckles]

13:57.462 --> 14:01.007
Did you know my dad has
a new girlfriend already?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.426
Well, what about your mom?
Is she dating anybody?

14:03.426 --> 14:07.222
No. [laughs] Oh,
and he has a beard now.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.099
- [laughs] Your dad has a beard?
- Yeah.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.351
Yeah, he thinks it
makes him look cool.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.103
Well, does it?

14:13.103 --> 14:15.313
Kind of. [giggles]

14:17.107 --> 14:18.775
I've waited all year for this.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.902
You want to race?

14:20.902 --> 14:22.571
- No, no, I can't, you...
- Oh, come on.

14:22.571 --> 14:25.115
Your legs are too long now.
I can't do that.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.241
Oh!

14:26.241 --> 14:28.243
- That was a bad start.
- You cheater.

- How was tour?

14:54.769 --> 14:56.563
Oh, my publishers didn't send me
on tour for this one.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.773
It's been
a pretty quiet release.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.066
- [grunts]
- Sorry.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.110
Are you on social media?

You should really be
on social media.

I've invited half the town.

What? You said this was just
going to be a small thing.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.252
Mika, I am so sorry,
but you might have to run

15:19.252 --> 15:21.171
to the Barnes & Noble
in Portsmouth and get some more.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.839
Business has been slow.
We haven't been

15:22.839 --> 15:24.090
- keeping as much stock.
- It's fine.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.342
What about this?

15:25.342 --> 15:27.177
You must have a hundred copies
of this book.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.929
[scoffs] Cleveland Castillo
is off-brand Jonathan Franzen.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.556
Cleveland Castillo
is such a phony name.

15:31.556 --> 15:34.351
It's like, "Hi, I'm masculine,
but I'm an intellectual."

15:34.351 --> 15:36.227
- I bet Hemingway is his hero.
- Mm-hmm.

15:36.227 --> 15:39.022
I bet he wears
horn-rimmed glasses.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.440
Yeah, see?

15:40.440 --> 15:43.026
[laughs]

15:43.026 --> 15:45.487
Yeah, contacts irritate my eyes.

15:49.491 --> 15:52.327
- Goodbye... Cleveland.
- [entry bell jingles]

15:52.327 --> 15:53.578
[Mika] Yeah, that was him.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.747
He's renting the Burke house
all summer.

15:55.747 --> 15:58.249
Oh, that's a nice place.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.001
[winces] Sorry.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.130

16:04.130 --> 16:06.800
Steven, I swear to God,
if you look at that phone

16:06.800 --> 16:08.843
one more time, I'm putting it
in the screen basket.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.179

your beautiful faces.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.806
Can dinner be
a screen-free zone?

16:12.806 --> 16:14.933
- You know, like the olden days.
- [laughs]

16:14.933 --> 16:17.352
Steven.

16:17.352 --> 16:20.522
- Dude, are you kidding me?
- Boom! Nailed it.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.816
Okay, okay, okay, we get it,
you've been working out.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.192
Oh, you're just jealous

16:24.192 --> 16:25.735
because Jere has
a better body than you.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.947
Uh, no, actually, it's
all about the lean look now.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.448
Otherwise, you can't wear
tailored suits.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.491
- [laughter]
- [Jeremiah] Sure, sure.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.034
Tailored suits.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.036
When are you leaving
for training camp, man?

16:36.079 --> 16:38.248
Uh, he quit football.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.960
Wh...

16:41.960 --> 16:43.169
Wait, really? You quit?

16:43.169 --> 16:44.546
Mm-hmm.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.548
Are you kidding me, man? I'd-I'd
kill to play college ball.

16:46.548 --> 16:47.841
He can always change his mind.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.509
I'm not gonna change my mind.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.262
I was just gonna sit
on the bench all season anyways.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.847
Well, if you're not playing
football anymore,

16:53.847 --> 16:55.181
what are you gonna do
all summer?

16:55.181 --> 16:56.725
[Steven] Oh, dude,
you can work at the club.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.518
- Yeah, with me and Jere.
- Yeah.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.811
I'm not gonna work at the club.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.479
Wait, you guys
are working this summer?

17:01.479 --> 17:02.814
Yeah, I'm lifeguarding,

17:02.814 --> 17:04.482
and Steven's working
at the snack shop.

17:06.151 --> 17:08.570
Oh, Belly, I almost forgot.

17:08.570 --> 17:11.030
I have a surprise for you.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.657
[chuckles]

17:12.657 --> 17:14.242
So, this is why
you had to stop by

17:14.242 --> 17:15.493
- the country club.
- Mm.

17:15.493 --> 17:18.288
What, uh, wh-wh-what is that?

17:18.288 --> 17:21.166
I wrangled Belly an invitation
to be a debutante.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.876
Is that the thing
where the girls

17:22.876 --> 17:24.502
wear white dresses and curtsy?

17:24.502 --> 17:26.546
It's when a girl comes of age

17:26.546 --> 17:28.423
and is presented to society.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.592
I-I know it sounds silly,
but I swear it's fun.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.719
Girls come from all over
New England to Cousins

17:32.719 --> 17:34.095
just to be a part of it.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.722
You'll make so many new friends.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.390
I cannot believe
you are still holding on

17:37.390 --> 17:38.600
to this archaic dream.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.060
No, it used to be
about finding a husband,

17:41.060 --> 17:42.687
but now it's about networking.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.272
They teach you
leadership skills,

17:44.272 --> 17:46.107
like how to market yourself,

17:46.107 --> 17:48.651
and it benefits charity.
It's, um, like a bat mitzvah.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.403
[laughs] It is not
like a bat mitzvah.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.490
There is nothing religious
about a debutante ball.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.074
The whole deb scene is bullshit.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.159
It's for sheep.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.077
- Yeah.
- No, it's not.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.746
It's when a girl
has a coming out,

17:59.746 --> 18:02.415
it's a formal recognition
she's reached maturity.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.583
[laughing]

18:03.583 --> 18:07.086
- Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. Mature?
- Yes.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.505
- Belly?
- Mm-hmm.

18:08.505 --> 18:09.964
[Steven] A-a couple months ago
you had a cat funeral.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.466
You made us all wear black.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.135
Shut up, Steven.
I saw you crying in your room.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.763
Wait, Mochi died?
Dang. I'm sorry, Bells.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.389
Belly.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.141
Don't you want to get
all dressed up?

18:20.141 --> 18:23.186
It's just not
Belly's kind of thing.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.230
She's our feral
little alley cat.

18:25.230 --> 18:28.191
[laughter]

18:28.191 --> 18:29.442
Alley cat.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.611
I'll think about it.
