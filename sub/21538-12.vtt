WEBVTT

00:03.036 --> 00:04.371
- TONIGHT, PART ONE

00:04.404 --> 00:05.939
OF THE<i>MILLION DOLLAR LISTING</i>
<i>NEW YORK REUNION.</i>

00:05.972 --> 00:09.075
- FOR THREE SEASONS, I HAVE
OUTSOLD THE OTHER TWO GUYS.

00:09.109 --> 00:10.777
THAT'S A FACT.
- OH, YOU HAVE AN OFFER!

00:10.810 --> 00:11.845
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!
- THE TRUTH IS

00:11.878 --> 00:13.613
YOU DON'T HAVE--
- WHOO!

00:13.646 --> 00:14.714
THAT'S NOT FUNNY?
WHAT THE [bleep]?

00:14.748 --> 00:16.216
- THAT IS FUNNY.
- THAT'S AWKWARD.

00:16.249 --> 00:17.984
YOU'RE CALLING ME [bleep]STICK,
COCKHOLE.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.719
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT
TO YOUR FACE.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.254
- PERSONALLY, I THINK
IT'LL BE THE STRAW

00:21.287 --> 00:22.689
THAT BREAKS
THE CAMEL'S BACK.

00:22.722 --> 00:24.591
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

00:24.624 --> 00:27.027
- HE MEANS THAT HE THINKS YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WOULDN'T SURVIVE.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.995
YOU THINK HIS DEALS
ARE SMALL POTATOES.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.297
- I THINK YOUR LISTINGS
HAVE GONE DOWN, ACTUALLY.

00:31.331 --> 00:33.033
- [laughs]
- WHOA.

00:33.066 --> 00:34.834
- THE NUMBER ONE RULE IS THERE'S
NO CRYING IN REAL ESTATE.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.170
- I HAVE BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH, ANDY.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.171
MOTHER[bleep].

00:38.204 --> 00:41.174
[crying]
I'M SORRY.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.776
- GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY,

00:42.809 --> 00:46.346
AND WELCOME TO OUR FIRST EVER
<i>MILLION DOLLAR LISTING REUNION.</i>

00:46.379 --> 00:49.949
I'M ANDY COHEN
IN SOHO, NEW YORK CITY,

00:49.983 --> 00:52.318
WITH<i>MILLION DOLLAR LISTING</i>
<i>NEW YORK'S</i>

00:52.352 --> 00:54.454
FREDRIK EKLUND...
- HI. YOU LOOK VERY HANDSOME.

00:54.487 --> 00:55.455
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M GOOD.

00:55.488 --> 00:57.424
- AS DO YOU.
RYAN SERHANT...

00:57.457 --> 00:59.859
- HELLO.
- HI, RY RY.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.429
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GREAT. AND LUIS D. ORTIZ.

01:02.462 --> 01:04.164
- HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
- HI, LUIS. HAIR'S LOOKING GOOD.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.299
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOURS AS WELL.

01:06.332 --> 01:07.934
- HOW LONG DID THAT TAKE?
- THIS MORNING, FIVE MINUTES.

01:07.967 --> 01:09.502
- FIVE MINUTES?
- I'M A PRO.

01:09.536 --> 01:12.372
- DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
OKAY, WELL, YOU ALL LOOK GREAT.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.773
WE GOT A LOT
OF VIEWER QUESTIONS.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.308
I WANT TO JUMP RIGHT IN.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.143
ALL RIGHT, JESSICA
FROM PORTLAND, OREGON, SAID,

01:17.177 --> 01:20.613
"RYAN, YOU'RE SUCH A HANDSOME
GUY, BUT I HAVE TO ASK,

01:20.647 --> 01:25.085
WHY DO YOU WEAR YOUR PANTS
SO INCREDIBLY TIGHT?"

01:27.554 --> 01:29.656
- I WOULD SAY PANTS HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR ME.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.859
I HAVE LARGE LEGS,
BUT I HAVE A SMALL WAIST.

01:32.892 --> 01:35.895
IF IT WERE UP TO ME, I WOULD
LIVE IN A PANTS-LESS WORLD.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.431
- NOW, I NOTICED THAT
ABOUT YOU TODAY.

01:38.465 --> 01:39.899
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.101
- I MEAN,
I WORK OUT A LOT,

01:41.101 --> 01:42.936
SO THEN MY LEGS
BECOME MORE MANLY,

01:42.969 --> 01:45.605
BUT I CAN'T KEEP BUYING
NEW SUITS.

01:45.638 --> 01:46.840
SO THEN TRYING TO FIT
INTO MY PANTS,

01:46.873 --> 01:48.008
IT GETS
A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT,

01:48.108 --> 01:49.576
BUT THESE ARE LIKE--
- ACTUALLY, STAND UP.

01:49.609 --> 01:50.944
I WANT YOU TO SHOW THE GUYS
HOW TIGHT YOUR PANTS ARE.

01:50.977 --> 01:52.746
- THESE ARE REALLY--
THEY'RE LIKE--

01:52.779 --> 01:55.815
THEY'RE--
THEY'RE A LITTLE TIGHT.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.484
- IT'S HARD
BEING RYAN SERHANT.

01:57.517 --> 01:59.652
- IT IS.
- IT IS.

01:59.686 --> 02:02.956
NOW, WHAT HAS BEEN EACH
OF YOUR MOST EMBARRASSING MOMENT

02:03.056 --> 02:05.125
ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR LISTING</i>
<i>NEW YORK</i>SO FAR?

02:05.158 --> 02:07.594
- OH, MY GOD. THERE'S SO MANY.
- YOU'VE BEEN ON THREE SEASONS.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.396
WHAT--WHAT'S YOUR MOST
EMBARRASSING MOMENT?

02:09.429 --> 02:11.598
- WHEW.
[exhales]

02:11.631 --> 02:14.067
I MEAN, I THINK WHEN
I POURED THE DRINK OVER LUIS.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.902
- LISTEN, STOP DOING
THAT BULL[bleep]!

02:15.935 --> 02:17.671
THAT IS [bleep] DISRESPECTFUL!
- LA, LA, LA, LA, LA!

02:17.704 --> 02:18.972
DON'T BE
A STUPID [bleep] CHILD.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.407
- GIVE ME THAT GODDAMN CHECK.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:20.440 --> 02:21.875
BUT IT LOOKS SO--
[bleep] PIECE OF [bleep]!

02:21.908 --> 02:24.277
I SWEAR TO GOD, MAN, YOU--

02:24.310 --> 02:26.379
- IT WAS SO NASTY AND UGLY,

02:26.413 --> 02:28.882
AND, LIKE, I'M TWICE THE SIZE.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.183
THERE I AM, LIKE,
PBBT.

02:30.216 --> 02:33.186
AND THAT LA, LA, LA, LA, LA,
AND I CANNOT WATCH IT.

02:33.219 --> 02:34.854
- IT'S NOT ABOUT--
IT'S NOT ABOUT TWICE THE SIZE.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.556
IT'S ALWAYS--YOU ALWAYS--I'M
SORRY TO CALL YOU OUT, BUT...

02:36.589 --> 02:38.124
- WHAT?
- YOU ALWAYS SAY THOSE THINGS.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.559
"I'M TWICE THE SIZE"--
- I JUST SAID

02:39.592 --> 02:41.161
IT WAS NASTY OF ME, SO...
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

02:41.194 --> 02:44.130
LISTEN, YOU ALWAYS TALK WITH THE
SAME TONE, AND IT'S DISGUSTING.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.433
AND I NEED TO STOP YOU RIGHT
THERE, BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS--

02:46.466 --> 02:48.101
IT'S--
- LUIS, I JUST SAID THAT I'M--

02:48.101 --> 02:49.402
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I MEAN, LISTEN,

02:49.436 --> 02:52.005
YOU FEEL BAD FOR THE FACT
THAT YOU THREW TEA ON ME.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.007
THAT'S FINE, BUT YOU KNOW,
"TWICE THE SIZE."

02:54.107 --> 02:55.442
YOU GOTTA--YOU GOTTA
LOWER YOURSELF DOWN

02:55.475 --> 02:58.845
A LITTLE BIT, MAN.
- I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT I DID.

02:58.878 --> 03:00.313
- LISTEN, YOU KEEP BEING
THIS CLOSE-MINDED,

03:00.347 --> 03:01.581
YOU'LL NEVER LEARN ANYTHING.

03:01.614 --> 03:03.516
- WHOA! OKAY.

03:03.550 --> 03:04.617
- WHAT'S YOUR MOST
EMBARRASSING MOMENT?

03:04.651 --> 03:09.155
- [sighs] I'M SORRY.
I GOT HEATED UP.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.590
I THINK, YOU KNOW,
ALSO--ALSO THAT FIGHT.

03:10.623 --> 03:12.292
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.627
IT WAS. YES, IT WAS.
TO LOOK AT THAT, IT'S NOT--

03:14.661 --> 03:16.963
IT'S, YOU KNOW, WE'RE--WE'RE
IN BUSINESS AND, YOU KNOW,

03:17.063 --> 03:18.498
WE SEE THESE THINGS,
AND WE'RE LIKE, "REALLY?"

03:18.531 --> 03:19.833
- YEAH.
- "YOU WENT THERE?"

03:19.866 --> 03:21.835
SO YEAH, THAT MOMENT TOO.
- RY?

03:21.868 --> 03:24.471
- WHEN I WAS NAKED
IN THE SHOWER.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.272
- NOTHING TO BE EMBARRASSED
ABOUT.

03:26.306 --> 03:27.674
- BUT YEAH--
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:27.707 --> 03:30.877
LIKE, AT THE--YEAH,
FREDRIK LIKED IT, SO WE'RE FINE.

03:30.910 --> 03:32.645
- [laughs]

03:32.679 --> 03:35.949
- WELL, I HAVE TO SAY,
THIS WAS MY FAVORITE SEASON.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.451
ONCE AGAIN, RYAN, FREDRIK,
AND LUIS,

03:38.485 --> 03:41.988
YOU HAD YOUR SHARE OF DEALS,
DOLLARS, AND DRAMA.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.757
I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK
AT WHAT HAPPENED

03:43.790 --> 03:45.759
AS YOU THREE LITTLE PIGGIES

03:45.792 --> 03:48.161
WENT TO THE REAL ESTATE MARKET.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.098
- [gasps]

03:52.132 --> 03:55.135
"5.350 IS A GO.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.504
WAY TO GO, FREDDY."
- ALL RIGHT!

03:57.537 --> 03:59.439
WHOO!
- LA, LA, LA, LA, LA!

03:59.472 --> 04:02.609
- 3.9.
3.9.

04:02.642 --> 04:04.044
YES!

04:04.044 --> 04:05.645
- 11.95. YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR [bleep] DEAL!

04:05.679 --> 04:09.616
- OH, MY GOD! BIGGEST DEAL
OF MY CAREER. LET'S GO!

04:09.649 --> 04:10.950
- WOW.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.520
- OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.288
- RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE IN A VERY CRAZY MARKET.

04:15.321 --> 04:16.790
IT'S NOT ABOUT SELLING UNITS.

04:16.823 --> 04:19.092
IT'S ABOUT SELLING THEM
FOR THE TOP DOLLAR.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.093
- $6 MILLION.

04:20.126 --> 04:21.094
- 40 MILLION.

04:21.127 --> 04:22.095
- 7.8.

04:22.128 --> 04:25.065
- $180-MILLION SELLOUT.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.066
I LOVE YOU.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.467
- SO THIS IS A DEAL?

04:27.500 --> 04:29.502
- CAN YOU GET ME TOP DOLLAR?
- I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.171
- I'M THINKING 14 MILLION.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.505
- NO.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NO?

04:32.539 --> 04:34.407
- 16, AND THAT'S IT.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.676
- YOU SAID 7 1/2.
- WE DID SAY 7 1/2.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.111
- AND SO I GOT YOU 7 1/2.

04:38.144 --> 04:39.679
- GET MORE.
- NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, NO.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.114
- I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING
THAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO

04:41.147 --> 04:43.316
WHEN WE FIRST MET. I'VE DONE--
- YOU HAVE.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.684
- LET ME EXPLAIN, PLEASE.
LET ME EXPLAIN.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.720
- SOME EXPLAINING TO DO?
NOW, YOU ARE RICKY RICARDO.

04:46.753 --> 04:49.155
- LISTEN. I HAVE LET YOU CALL ME
RICKY RICARDO ALL YOU WANT.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.191
- LUCY! LUCY, YOU HAVE
SOME EXPLAINING TO DO.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.127
- YOU'VE GOTTA BRING ME
SOMETHING CLOSE--

04:54.160 --> 04:56.196
- JOEL, I'M BRINGING YOU THE--
NO OTHER BROKER

04:56.229 --> 04:57.864
CAN GET THIS DONE FOR YOU.
- NO, NO, NO. HANG ON, HANG ON.

04:57.897 --> 05:00.200
HANG ON, HANG ON.
- LET ME--YOU LISTEN TO ME NOW!

05:00.233 --> 05:01.267
- NO, NO, NO.
- LISTEN TO ME!

05:01.301 --> 05:04.270
- COME ON, MAN,
DO SOMETHING.

05:06.673 --> 05:09.642
- HOW DO YOU GUYS FUNCTION
WITH SUCH A HIGH LEVEL OF STRESS

05:09.676 --> 05:12.479
ALL THE TIME?
RYAN, YOU'VE GOTTEN A LOT GRAYER

05:12.512 --> 05:15.215
IN THE LAST FEW SEASONS.
- VERY MUCH LIKE OBAMA.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.883
- YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE UNDER
THE SAME AMOUNT OF PRESSURE?

05:16.916 --> 05:20.920
- [laughs]
I'M NOT GONNA ANSWER THAT.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.789
- YOU HAD
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SALES

05:22.822 --> 05:24.691
IN DOLLAR AMOUNTS
THIS SEASON,

05:24.724 --> 05:27.260
AND YOUR APARTMENTS
WERE THE LEAST EXPENSIVE.

05:27.293 --> 05:28.528
- UH-HUH.

05:28.561 --> 05:31.664
- IS THAT REFLECTIVE OF
YOUR BUSINESS, OR WAS THAT JUST

05:31.698 --> 05:33.333
WHAT YOU WOUND UP GETTING
ON THE AIR?

05:33.366 --> 05:35.201
- NO, I WAS--

05:35.235 --> 05:37.303
I WAS HONESTLY MORE INTERESTED
IN THE STORIES.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.239
BECAUSE LAST YEAR,
LIKE, SEASON TWO,

05:39.272 --> 05:41.374
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE
DEAL AFTER DEAL AFTER DEAL,

05:41.408 --> 05:44.411
AND ALL PEOPLE REMEMBERED WERE,
LIKE, THE STORIES.

05:44.444 --> 05:45.979
ALL PEOPLE CARED ABOUT
WERE THE PIG.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.614
[pig oinks]

05:47.647 --> 05:49.616
AHH, TRAPPED YA.
- OKAY, OKAY.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.718
- OH, IT'S OKAY.

05:51.751 --> 05:54.954
[pig squealing and grunting]

05:54.988 --> 05:56.756
RIGHT, THAT'S ALL PEOPLE
ASKED ME ABOUT, THE PIG.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.158
- RIGHT.
- LIKE, WHAT ABOUT THE FACT

05:58.191 --> 06:00.293
THAT I SOLD THAT APARTMENT
FOR $7 1/2 MILLION

06:00.326 --> 06:02.328
THAT EVERYONE TOLD ME
I COULD SELL FOR 4?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.531
THEY'RE LIKE, "I DON'T REMEMBER
THAT ONE. WHAT ABOUT THE PIG?"

06:04.564 --> 06:06.433
- RIGHT.
- I THINK IT'S HILARIOUS

06:06.466 --> 06:08.401
THAT YOUR LISTINGS
HAVE GONE DOWN, ACTUALLY.

06:08.435 --> 06:11.538
I MEAN, IN THE FIRST SEASON,
I ACTUALLY FELT LIKE

06:11.571 --> 06:13.506
"WOW," I MEAN,
THE PARK AND PIER.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.576
YOU HAD ALL THOSE BIG LISTINGS,
AND OBVIOUSLY NOW, THIS SEASON,

06:16.609 --> 06:18.878
WHAT DID YOU END UP WITH,
1.7 MILLION?

06:18.912 --> 06:21.948
- YOU THINK HIS DEALS
ARE KIND OF SMALL POTATOES.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.183
- I THINK THEY'RE LIKE--

06:23.216 --> 06:24.751
YOU KNOW, HE SAYS
HE'S INTO THE STORIES.

06:24.784 --> 06:27.120
TO ME, IT'S LIKE,
"THIS IS A REAL ESTATE SHOW."

06:27.153 --> 06:29.089
- I'M FAR MORE ATTRACTED
TO WATCHING THE STORIES

06:29.122 --> 06:31.558
AS TO HOW THESE DEALS ARE DONE,
HOW YOU TAKE A HOUSE

06:31.591 --> 06:34.594
THAT, LITERALLY, THE DOOR
HASN'T BEEN OPENED SINCE 1985.

06:34.627 --> 06:35.695
WOW.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.064
THIS IS SUPER '80s.
- YES, IT IS.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.065
- THERE'S A LOT OF GREEN TILE,
HUH?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.400
- YEAH.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.435
- IT HASN'T BEEN OPENED
AND--AND HOW YOU SELL THAT.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.470
- I LIKE THAT ONE.

06:43.503 --> 06:46.106
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.
- THANKS.

06:46.139 --> 06:49.509
- WELL, IF THERE'S ONE PERSON
THAT RYAN CAN'T SEEM TO CHARM,

06:49.542 --> 06:51.678
IT IS FREDRIK.

06:51.711 --> 06:54.681
THESE TWO HAVE HAD AN ESPECIALLY
CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP

06:54.714 --> 06:56.249
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.

06:56.282 --> 06:59.686
AND EVEN THOUGH THEIR RIVALRY
STEMS FROM BUSINESS,

06:59.719 --> 07:03.423
THINGS ALWAYS SEEM TO GET
VERY PERSONAL.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.725
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.028
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.096
- RYAN AND I
HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER

07:10.130 --> 07:12.098
SINCE THAT NIGHT
WHEN HE HUMILIATED ME.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.135
- IN THE SCENE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO WATCH, THEY TAKE IT.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.503
THIS SPEECH
IS IN DIRECT REFERENCE

07:16.536 --> 07:19.839
TO AN ADULT FILM
THAT FREDRIK STARRED IN.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.742
- I'M STANDING
IN FRONT OF ALL THE BROKERS

07:22.776 --> 07:25.245
THAT I DO DEALS WITH.
I'M COMPLETELY HUMILIATED.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.379
- HOW ARE YOU?

07:26.413 --> 07:27.847
LAST YEAR,
I LEFT MYSELF OPEN,

07:27.881 --> 07:29.683
AND I WAS TOO TRUSTING,
AND I LEARNED FROM IT

07:29.716 --> 07:31.651
BY BEING [bleep] OVER.
HE WANTS A ONE-BEDROOM.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.421
- THIS ONE.
6-C, THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONE.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.656
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
- SUPPLY AND DEMAND, ISN'T IT?

07:36.690 --> 07:39.459
- I'VE NOW REALIZED,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

07:39.492 --> 07:41.061
YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.829
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
[bleep] EVERYONE.

07:42.862 --> 07:46.232
JUST REMEMBER, YOU ARE JUST
A CHEAP, SHINY IMPORT.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.834
- THERE'S SO MUCH
I WANT TO TELL HIM.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.069
I JUST HAVE
TO GET IT OUT.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.704
YOU HUMILIATED ME IN FRONT

07:50.737 --> 07:52.439
OF A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT I WORK WITH.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.174
- YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST BUSINESS.
- IT'S NOT BUSINESS, RYAN.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.475
YOU TOOK IT
TO A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.644
- WE HAD ONE DEAL
THAT I THOUGHT WENT BAD,

07:57.677 --> 07:59.546
SO MAYBE I OVERREACTED.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

07:59.579 --> 08:00.680
DO YOU WANT ME TO CRY
IN FRONT OF YOU?

08:00.714 --> 08:02.115
- NO, RYAN.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

08:02.148 --> 08:04.017
- I HAVE--I'M A HUMAN BEING.
I CRY. DON'T YOU GET IT?

08:04.017 --> 08:05.785
- FREDRIK DOES
WHAT HE WANTS

08:05.819 --> 08:07.887
AND THEN AS SOON AS SOMEONE JUST
FIGHTS BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT,

08:07.921 --> 08:09.756
HE "FAKE CRIES."

08:09.789 --> 08:11.758
- YOU HURT ME.

08:13.626 --> 08:17.564
- SO, FREDRIK,
WHERE DO YOU GUYS STAND NOW?

08:17.597 --> 08:21.034
- I GOT AN APOLOGY--YOUR SHOW,
<i>WATCH WHAT HAPPENS LIVE--</i>

08:21.067 --> 08:25.205
BUT IT WAS A REAL, LIKE,
FAKE, HALF-ASSED APOLOGY.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.040
- ARE YOU WILLING
TO EVER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT?

08:27.040 --> 08:29.843
- YEAH, I SAID I'M SORRY.
YO, DUDE.

08:29.876 --> 08:34.147
BRO, I'M SORRY, MAN.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.715
I AM. I HONES--
- DO YOU MEAN IT?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.417
- YEAH, I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?

08:37.450 --> 08:39.285
- I APPRECIATE THAT.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.054
THEN, OF COURSE,
I TUNE IN

08:41.054 --> 08:42.822
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE,
SEE THE FOOTAGE,

08:42.856 --> 08:45.892
EVERY WEDNESDAY,
AND HE'S STILL CALLING ME NAMES,

08:45.925 --> 08:47.527
SAYING I'M FAKE,

08:47.560 --> 08:49.229
SAYING I'M MANIPULATIVE,
CONTROLLING,

08:49.262 --> 08:51.131
SO I DON'T KNOW.
I'M CONFUSED.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.099
- I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT APOLOGY,

08:53.133 --> 08:55.301
BECAUSE MY SENSE FROM YOU
IS THAT

08:55.335 --> 08:57.203
THAT ISSUE THAT HAPPENED
LAST SEASON

08:57.237 --> 08:59.839
HAS NEVER FULLY BEEN RESOLVED
FOR YOU.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.675
- NO. IT WAS THE MOST EVIL THING
ANYONE CAN DO.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.344
AND IN MY ENTIRE CAREER,
12 YEARS IN NEW YORK,

09:04.377 --> 09:06.413
NO ONE HAS EVER, EVER ONCE

09:06.446 --> 09:08.648
HAD A PROBLEM
WITH MY PAST, EVER.

09:08.682 --> 09:12.652
SO IT WAS THE MOST GENIUS,
EVIL THING TO MAKE IT

09:12.686 --> 09:16.356
A SCANDALOUS, DIRTY THING
WHEN IT REALLY ISN'T

09:16.389 --> 09:19.125
AND BRING IT ON NATION--
INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION,

09:19.159 --> 09:20.627
AND THERE I AM WITH THE CAMERA--
- YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.362
IT WAS--I WAS THE ONE.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.630
IT WAS ALL ME.

09:23.663 --> 09:24.831
PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT YOUR PAST UNTIL ME.

09:24.864 --> 09:26.499
- NO. EVERYONE KNOWS,

09:26.533 --> 09:28.768
BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT,
LIKE, A DIRTY SECRET.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.037
I-I'VE ALWAYS BEEN OPEN
ABOUT IT.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.106
- I WANT TO TAKE ONE STEP BACK
AND SAY,

09:33.139 --> 09:35.208
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOUR PAST,

09:35.241 --> 09:36.910
WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

09:36.943 --> 09:41.348
- 12 YEARS AGO, I DID
A FEW GAY PORN MOVIES. YEAH.

09:41.381 --> 09:45.251
AND IT WAS A COUPLE WEEKS
OF MY LIFE, BUT--

09:45.285 --> 09:46.853
- DO YOU REGRET DOING THAT?

09:46.886 --> 09:48.088
- I DON'T REGRET ANYTHING
IN LIFE.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.556
I CAN'T REGRET.
AM I PROUD OF IT? NO.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.257
- I THINK YOU SHOULD BE.
- YOU WON AN AWARD.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.826
- [chuckles]

09:52.859 --> 09:54.060
HERE WE GO AGAIN.
- NO, BUT--

09:54.094 --> 09:55.395
- WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

09:55.428 --> 09:57.497
YOU DID WIN AN AWARD,
DID YOU NOT?

09:57.530 --> 09:59.632
- I WON A FEW AWARDS, YES.
THEY'RE STATUES.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.268
I HAD THEM FOR MANY YEARS
IN MY UNDERWEAR DRAWER.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.270
THEY'RE NOT WHAT YOU THINK
THEY LOOK LIKE.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.740
THEY'RE, LIKE, CRYSTAL.
- WHAT AWARD DID YOU WIN?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.508
- ARE WE DOING THIS RIGHT NOW?
all: YEAH.

10:08.541 --> 10:09.909
- I WANT TO KNOW.
- EMBRACE IT.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.311
- I WON, OKAY,
BEST SOLO SCENE.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.347
- BEST SOLO SCENE.
ALL RIGHT.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.915
AND SO WHAT DID HE DO
TO YOU?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.917
I--BECAUSE FOR PEOPLE
WHO DIDN'T SEE THAT.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.185
- IF PEOPLE WHO DID SEE IT KNOW,
I DIDN'T--

10:19.219 --> 10:21.354
- EVERYONE MUST HAVE SEEN THAT.
- I NEVER, EVER

10:21.388 --> 10:24.024
WAS GONNA PLAY YOUR PORNOGRAPHY
OR ANYONE ELSE'S PORNOGRAPHY

10:24.057 --> 10:25.792
AT AN OPEN HOUSE.
- DO YOU--

10:25.825 --> 10:27.260
- DO YOU THINK I'M INSANE?
- YOU HAD AN OPEN HOUSE.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.461
YOU INVITED PEOPLE.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.996
YOU MADE IT SEEM LIKE
YOU WERE ABOUT TO SHOW--

10:30.030 --> 10:31.364
- OH, MY GOD, RYAN--
- THE APARTMENT THAT

10:31.398 --> 10:32.699
THE OPEN HOUSE WAS IN HAD--
- RYAN, NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:32.732 --> 10:35.235
- NO, BUT, RYAN, ONE THING.
I THINK, YOU KNOW...

10:35.268 --> 10:36.536
- DON'T EVEN START WITH ME.
- WHETHER YOU HAVE SHOWN THEM

10:36.569 --> 10:37.937
THE FILM OR DIDN'T...
- DON'T EVEN START.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.305
- I THINK YOU DID
EXACTLY THE SAME.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.842
- NO. BECAUSE THERE WERE, LIKE,
50 PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM

10:42.876 --> 10:44.444
WHO HAD NO IDEA
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT,

10:44.477 --> 10:45.545
EXCEPT FOR THIS GUY.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.547
- EVERYBODY KNEW.
RYAN, DON'T--

10:47.580 --> 10:49.883
- NO ONE HAD ANY CLUE.
- OKAY, GUYS--

10:49.916 --> 10:51.151
- SO WHEN YOU'RE SAYING IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN THE SAME THING,

10:51.184 --> 10:52.819
IF I HAD PLAYED PORN,
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID,

10:52.852 --> 10:55.522
"HOLY [bleep],
THERE'S PORN ON THE SCREEN.

10:55.555 --> 10:56.690
- BUT IT'S--
- I PLAYED A CARTOON.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.191
- YEAH, BUT IT'S DEEPER
THAN THAT.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.326
- I PLAYED A CARTOON,
AND THEN HE CRIED.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.728
THE NUMBER ONE RULE PEOPLE TOLD
ME WHEN I GOT INTO REAL ESTATE

11:01.761 --> 11:03.363
IS THERE'S NO CRYING
IN REAL ESTATE.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.065
THERE IS NO CRYING IN BUSINESS.
- YEAH, BUT--

11:05.065 --> 11:06.433
- THIS WASN'T REAL ESTATE.
THAT'S THE POINT YOU DON'T GET.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.902
YOU DIDN'T SHOW THE MOVIE, NO.
THANK GOD.

11:08.935 --> 11:12.272
BUT EVERYBODY THOUGHT,
INCLUDING THE VIEWER,

11:12.305 --> 11:13.907
THAT YOU WERE,
AND THAT'S THE POINT.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.375
THAT WAS YOUR PLAN.
YOU EVEN SAID YOU HAD A PLAN.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.377
YOU WANTED ME TO HURT
SO BADLY.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.279
SO YOU SUCCEEDED.
CONGRATULATIONS.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.349
I MEAN, I AM QUIRKY AND WEIRD
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE

11:22.382 --> 11:24.284
AND COLORFUL,
BUT I AM WHO I AM.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.752
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
WHO I AM.

11:25.785 --> 11:28.788
- DO WE HAVE AN AWARD
TO GIVE HIM MAYBE?

11:28.822 --> 11:30.523
- WHAT?

11:30.557 --> 11:31.891
- COMING UP...

11:31.925 --> 11:32.892
- YOU'RE SITTING IN MY OFFICE

11:32.926 --> 11:34.961
CALLING ME [bleep]STICK,
COCKHOLE.

11:34.994 --> 11:36.096
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT
TO YOUR FACE.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.864
- YES, YOU DID.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.733
- THAT'S SUCH [bleep]
BULL[bleep], MAN.

11:45.605 --> 11:48.108
- WELCOME BACK.
I'M ANDY COHEN

11:48.141 --> 11:51.578
WITH THE MEN OF<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK.</i>

11:51.611 --> 11:53.313
NOW, HE JUST POURED
HIS HEART OUT

11:53.346 --> 11:54.581
TO YOU ABOUT A VERY SPECIFIC--

11:54.614 --> 11:56.449
- OH, THAT'S SUCH [bleep]
BULL[bleep], MAN.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.252
HE POURS HIS HEART AND SOUL
FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT,

11:59.285 --> 12:01.554
AND HE KNOWS IT,
AND HE KNOWS IT.

12:01.588 --> 12:02.922
AND NO ONE WILL EVER
CALL HIM OUT ON IT.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.424
HE'S THE FIVE-YEAR-OLD KID

12:04.457 --> 12:06.192
WHO, LIKE, SMACKS EVERYONE
IN THE FACE,

12:06.226 --> 12:07.460
AND THEN WHEN HE DOESN'T GET
WHAT HE WANTS,

12:07.494 --> 12:08.895
HE STANDS THERE, HE CRIES,
AND HE STOMPS HIS FEET

12:08.928 --> 12:10.463
UNTIL HE GETS WHAT HE WANTS.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.299
- FIND ONE SINGLE SCENE
IN FOUR YEARS, IN THREE SEASONS

12:13.333 --> 12:15.835
I EVER SAID
ONE SINGLE DEROGATORY THING

12:15.869 --> 12:16.870
ABOUT EITHER ONE OF THEM.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.673
NEVER, EVER ONCE
HAVE I CALLED A NAME,

12:19.706 --> 12:22.275
AND YOU CALLED ME SO MANY.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.210
- DO YOU REGRET CALLING FREDRIK
A CHEAP IMPORT?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.813
- [laughs]
COME ON!

12:26.846 --> 12:28.748
IS THAT--

12:28.782 --> 12:30.750
THIS IS SUCH--
UM...

12:30.784 --> 12:33.153
I GREW UP WITH FRIENDS,
ALL WE DID

12:33.186 --> 12:35.922
WAS MAKE FUN OF EACH OTHER
ALL DAY LONG.

12:35.955 --> 12:38.825
THAT'S HOW--THAT'S HOW
YOU COME OF AGE, RIGHT?

12:38.858 --> 12:42.295
THAT'S HOW YOU GET A THICK SKIN,
AND SO COMING INTO NEW YORK,

12:42.328 --> 12:44.330
I'VE DEFINITELY HAD TO, LIKE,
TUNE THAT DOWN

12:44.364 --> 12:46.099
AND GOT TO BE REALLY PROTECTIVE
OF EVERYBODY.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.835
I GET THAT,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

12:48.868 --> 12:52.005
NO, I MEAN,
I-I MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.007
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
FEEL FREE TO MAKE FUN OF ME.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.443
- RYAN, YOU ACCUSED FREDRIK

12:56.476 --> 12:58.712
OF BEING A FAKE CRIER.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.715
LUIS, WHERE DO YOU COME DOWN
ON THIS?

13:01.748 --> 13:03.216
- SOMETIMES

13:03.249 --> 13:04.551
I FEEL THAT YOU'RE NOT GENUINE.
I FEEL THAT--

13:04.584 --> 13:07.454
- WELL, I LEARNED THAT
IN THE SEASON FINALE.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.622
- SOMETIMES, THAT'S ALL,
MY PERSONAL OPINION.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.424
- OKAY, WELL, I WANT TO

13:11.458 --> 13:13.426
JUST GET BACK
TO THE TWO OF YOU,

13:13.460 --> 13:15.462
BECAUSE BEFORE WE MOVE ON,
IS THIS SOMETHING

13:15.495 --> 13:17.731
YOU'RE PREPARED
TO APOLOGIZE FOR AGAIN?

13:17.764 --> 13:19.265
- NO, I DON'T WANT--
I DON'T WANT AN APOLOGY.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.868
I FEEL LIKE IT'S--IT'S OVER.
- I ALREADY APOLOGIZED.

13:21.901 --> 13:23.703
- IN HIS DEFENSE,
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW HE HURT ME,

13:23.737 --> 13:25.071
SO I DON'T NEED AN APOLOGY.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.973
- WHY DO YOU THINK WAS
THE REASON? NOT TO--NOT TO--

13:27.073 --> 13:28.108
- OH, MY GOD.
- NO. LET'S JUST STOP.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.576
WE'RE HERE
TO TALK ABOUT THINGS.

13:29.609 --> 13:30.777
SO DON'T--LISTEN.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.247
WHY DID HE DECIDE
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

13:34.280 --> 13:35.982
- OH, YOU MEAN,
WHY HE WANTED TO REVENGE?

13:36.082 --> 13:37.617
- YES.
- NOW WE'RE BACK, LIKE,

13:37.650 --> 13:40.286
18 EPISODES AGO.
- NO, BUT--LISTEN.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.223
- YEAH, I ADMIT I PUSHED
HIS BUTTONS, AND I--

13:43.256 --> 13:44.791
- YOU KNEW HOW MUCH
YOU HURT HIM? IF YOU DID...

13:44.824 --> 13:46.092
- WHY? WHY?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

13:46.126 --> 13:48.328
- WHY? BECAUSE YOU WERE
SITTING IN MY OFFICE

13:48.361 --> 13:51.264
CALLING ME [bleep]STICK,
COCKHOLE, UM--

13:51.297 --> 13:52.265
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT
TO YOUR FACE.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.234
- [laughs]
- YES, YOU DID.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.102
- BUT WHY DID HE SAY
THOSE THINGS?

13:56.136 --> 13:58.772
- LUIS. ANDY.
- YOU HAD LIED TO HIM

13:58.805 --> 14:00.607
ABOUT A DEAL, RIGHT?
- NO, I NEVER LIED.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.542
- THIS DIDN'T JUST
COME OUT OF NOWHERE, RIGHT?

14:02.575 --> 14:04.611
- WHAT ELSE
DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

14:04.644 --> 14:06.913
LIKE, I-I MADE HIM
REALLY ANGRY, YES.

14:06.946 --> 14:09.049
I-I DID THAT.
I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH HIM,

14:09.049 --> 14:10.684
AND OBVIOUSLY,
I REGRET THAT,

14:10.717 --> 14:13.453
BECAUSE KARMA GOT BACK TO ME
15 TIMES.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.888
- YOU DON'T REGRET IT

14:14.921 --> 14:17.223
BECAUSE YOU WERE ABLE TO USE
THE WHOLE THING

14:17.257 --> 14:18.658
AS THIS WHOLE
VICTIM PORTRAYAL

14:18.692 --> 14:21.294
SO THAT YOU COULD SIT THERE
AND YOU COULD BE KING FREDRIK

14:21.327 --> 14:23.797
AND YOU COULD MAKE THOSE FACES
AND DO YOUR WHOLE SPIEL, MAN.

14:23.830 --> 14:26.499
IT--IT WORKED OUT PERFECTLY
FOR YOU.

14:26.533 --> 14:30.170
IT DID, AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED,
"DO YOU HAVE AN AWARD FOR HIM?"

14:30.203 --> 14:32.138
FOR HIS SOCK DRAWER.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.975
THAT'S FUNNY! THAT'S NOT FUNNY?
WHAT THE [bleep]?

14:36.076 --> 14:38.845
- THAT IS FUNNY.
- THAT'S AWKWARD.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.081
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.917
- WELL, LUIS,
LAST YEAR YOU WERE

14:43.950 --> 14:46.353
THE DARK HORSE
IN THE RUNNING.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.955
AND THIS YEAR
YOU SURPRISED US ALL

14:48.988 --> 14:52.392
AS YOUR CAREER TOOK OFF

14:52.425 --> 14:54.294
AND YOU JOCKEYED
INTO A BETTER POSITION.

14:54.327 --> 14:58.131
LET'S SEE HOW LUIS
TURNED HIS LOSING STREAK

14:58.164 --> 15:01.201
INTO A WINNING SEASON.
WATCH.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.238
- THIS YEAR,
I'M CHANGING MY MIND-SET.

15:05.271 --> 15:09.843
SO FOR ME TO BE EXTREMELY
SUCCESSFUL AND RESPECTED,

15:09.876 --> 15:12.312
I NEED TO FOCUS
THAT ENERGY.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.914
- FASTER, FASTER.
ONE AFTER THE OTHER. GO.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.483
- [bleep], I FEEL LIKE
I'M MATURING.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.753
- I HAPPENED TO TEACH TENNIS,
AND IT WAS A TURN OF CAREERS,

15:19.786 --> 15:23.056
AND I DECIDED I WANTED TO GET
IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY.

15:23.056 --> 15:26.326
- TODD SHOULD BE
PART OF THE LISTING.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.729
- JOHN, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

15:29.763 --> 15:31.164
OH, GOOD.
WELL, MY NAME IS TODD,

15:31.197 --> 15:33.466
AND I THINK WE SHOULD MEET.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.805
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU CAN GET 7.8 MILLION

15:38.838 --> 15:40.373
FOR THAT APARTMENT?

15:40.407 --> 15:42.142
- ABSOLUTELY.
- 'CAUSE THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.443
- AND I WON'T DISAPPOINT.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.311
- THE TIMING IS UP.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.280
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

15:47.313 --> 15:48.481
- ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED
IN ME?

15:48.515 --> 15:51.518
- I AM DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.421
- I HAVE A BUYER
FOR 30 LINCOLN PLAZA.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.589
MAYBE THIS CAN BE A WAY
FOR YOU TO WORK WITH THEM AGAIN.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.924
- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING.
HE'S BEEN LOOKING.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.326
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.530
- I GOT AN OFFER
AT $8.5 MILLION.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.899
- WOW, THAT IS AWESOME.

16:05.932 --> 16:08.601
OH, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.936
YOU'VE GROWN,
AND YOU'VE MATURED,

16:10.036 --> 16:15.041
AND YOU'VE REALLY BECOME
A STELLAR POINT OF NEW YORK.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.609
- MUST FEEL GOOD TO WATCH.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.044
- IT FEELS GREAT.

16:18.044 --> 16:20.447
- YOU REALLY KINDA TURNED THINGS
AROUND FOR YOURSELF THIS SEASON.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.215
- YEAH.
- HOW'D YOU DO IT?

16:22.248 --> 16:24.617
- I'M A VERY PASSIONATE MAN.
I'M ALWAYS VERY EXCITED.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.586
AND IN THE BEGINNING,
I FELT THAT THAT WAS ENOUGH

16:26.619 --> 16:29.055
IN ORDER TO CREATE
SOMETHING GREAT.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.824
BUT THEN AS I MET
MORE INTELLECTUAL PEOPLE

16:30.857 --> 16:32.792
AND PEOPLE THAT I REALLY
LOOK UP TO, THEY SAID, YOU KNOW,

16:32.826 --> 16:34.928
ENERGY AND PASSION
IS ONLY 50% OF THE BATTLE.

16:34.961 --> 16:38.064
YOU NEED TO FOCUS, AND YOU NEED
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.633
YOU NEED TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK.
YOU NEED TO BECOME VALUABLE,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.969
OTHER THAN JUST SOMEONE
THAT PEOPLE LOVE.

16:43.069 --> 16:45.205
- TOM FROM HARTFORD,
CONNECTICUT, SAID,

16:45.238 --> 16:47.874
TENNIS TODD WAS THE FUNNIEST
CHARACTER ALL SEASON.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.176
- OH, MY GOD.
- LUIS, HOW IN THE WORLD

16:50.210 --> 16:52.445
COULD YOU WORK
WITH THAT RIDICULOUS GUY?

16:52.479 --> 16:53.947
- LISTEN--
- I REALLY ENJOYED

16:53.980 --> 16:56.683
WATCHING TODD...
- I THINK TODD WAS AMAZING.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.085
- AND YOUR MENTORSHIP OF HIM.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:59.119 --> 17:01.287
WHEN YOU CARE ABOUT SOMETHING,
YOU DON'T MAKE FUN OF 'EM.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.423
YOU ACTUALLY EMBRACE
THEIR FAILURES,

17:03.456 --> 17:05.492
AND YOU MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.595
YOU KNOW, NORMALLY,
THAT COLD-CALLING SCENE WAS--

17:08.628 --> 17:11.364
LIKE, IT WAS--
IT WAS HARD TO WATCH

17:11.398 --> 17:13.667
AND HARD TO BE THERE,
BUT THE GUY WENT FOR IT.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.868
- YEAH.
- AND IF I SAY, "LISTEN,

17:14.901 --> 17:16.036
YOU DON'T BELONG
IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.537
GET OUT THE DOOR,"
WHAT AM I DOING?

17:17.570 --> 17:18.872
I NEED TO ENCOURAGE HIM
AND TELL HIM, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:18.905 --> 17:20.440
"NOW THAT
THAT WAS SUCH A BAD CALL,

17:20.473 --> 17:22.509
YOU AT LEAST NOT MAKE IT
THE SAME WAY.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.645
AND HE MAKES IT WORSE,
AND YOU GO, "YOU NEED TO CARE."

17:25.679 --> 17:27.847
- I HEAR YOU GOT MORE LISTINGS
FROM HIS PARENTS.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.616
- YES, AND NOW I HAVE
TO PARTNER UP WITH HIM AGAIN.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.052
- OH, YOU DO?
- YES.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.053
- OH, MY GOD.
- YES.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.188
- AND HOW DID TODD REACT
TO THE SHOW?

17:35.221 --> 17:36.356
DID YOU HEAR FROM THEM
AFTER THE SHOW AIRED?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.657
- YES, I DID.

17:37.691 --> 17:39.926
I HAD A TEXT MESSAGE
AS SOON AS THAT EPISODE AIRED.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.062
HE SAYS, "THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THAT WAS AMAZING."

17:42.062 --> 17:44.297
AND I'M LIKE, "YEAH!"
- THAT'S GREAT.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.467
YOU GOT MORE TODD TIME
COMING UP IN YOUR FUTURE.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.069
IT'S AMAZING.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.671
WHAT'S IT LIKE WORKING
IN THE SAME COMPANY AS HIM?

17:51.705 --> 17:53.406
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S--

17:53.440 --> 17:56.076
I LIKE
THE COMPANY A LOT.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.877
I THINK THIS IS THE BEST
DECISION, PROFESSIONALLY,

17:57.911 --> 17:59.379
THAT I'VE MADE IN MY LIFE.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.081
I'M NOT WORKING WITH FREDRIK.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.916
WE JUST HAPPEN TO BE
IN THE SAME COMPANY.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.217
- RIGHT.
- I HAVE A DIFFERENT OFFICE.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.453
I'M WORKING FOR MYSELF.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.321
- MUST BE HARDER FOR YOU
JUST WORKING ON YOUR OWN.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.423
- YES.

18:10.457 --> 18:13.326
- FREDRIK, YOU THINK LUIS
SHOULD JOIN A TEAM?

18:13.360 --> 18:16.596
- WELL, I ASKED HIM ONCE
IF HE WANTED TO JOIN MINE.

18:16.629 --> 18:20.400
THAT WAS A NEGATIVE.
- WHOA.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.468
- DID YOU ASK HIM
TO JOIN YOUR--

18:21.501 --> 18:22.469
- DID YOU ASK LUIS
TO JOIN YOUR TEAM?

18:22.502 --> 18:24.537
- YEAH.
- DID YOU SAY NO?

18:24.571 --> 18:27.073
- OBVIOUSLY.
- [chuckles]

18:27.107 --> 18:28.475
CAN YOU ASK HIM AGAIN?

18:28.508 --> 18:31.611
- I THINK IT'S MY TIME
TO TURN THAT DOWN

18:31.644 --> 18:32.612
AFTER WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.581
- WHY'D YOU TURN IT DOWN?

18:34.614 --> 18:37.817
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE IN--

18:37.851 --> 18:40.120
[clears throat]
IN [bleep] UP.

18:40.153 --> 18:43.223
AND I WANNA--
I WANNA DO THE MISTAKES,

18:43.256 --> 18:45.792
BECAUSE IF I JUST TAKE
THE EASY ROAD,

18:45.825 --> 18:50.330
I WILL NOT BE AS GREAT AS A
PERSON AS I, YOU KNOW, WANNA BE.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.532
- RYAN'S LAUGHING.
- I WASN'T LAUGHING.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.767
- YOU WERE CHUCKLING.
- I WAS?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.902
- YES, YOU WERE. WHY?

18:55.935 --> 18:57.904
- I JUST--JUST THE WAY
THAT HE JUST SAID THAT

18:57.937 --> 19:01.608
KINDA SOUNDED LIKE, NO,
I DON'T WANT TO JOIN A TEAM

19:01.641 --> 19:03.243
BECAUSE I'M--
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO...

19:03.276 --> 19:04.878
- FAILING.
- MAKING A LOT OF MISTAKES

19:04.911 --> 19:06.579
WITH PEOPLE.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.014
IT'S JUST THE WAY IT SOUNDED
TO ME.

19:08.048 --> 19:09.382
IT'S JUST, LIKE,
THE WAY IT CAME OFF.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.517
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.285
- MY BIGGEST REGRET

19:12.318 --> 19:14.721
LOOKING BACK 12 YEARS
IS THAT I DIDN'T START ON 18.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.589
YOU KNOW, I SAT BY MYSELF,

19:16.623 --> 19:19.693
AND I WAS OBSESSED
TO MAKE IT.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.494
BUT I LOST SO MUCH TIME,

19:21.528 --> 19:23.596
'CAUSE THE ONLY WAY
YOU'RE GONNA LEARN REAL ESTATE

19:23.630 --> 19:25.198
IS LISTEN IN,
BEING A SPONGE.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.367
AND I LOST A LOT OF TIME
WORKING BY MYSELF,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.269
NO EXPERIENCE, NOTHING.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.303
- WOULD YOU JOIN RYAN'S TEAM

19:30.337 --> 19:32.238
IF HE OFFERED YOU?
- UH, NO.

19:32.272 --> 19:35.709
IT'S NOT--I WOULDN'T--
I WOULDN'T JOIN ANYBODY'S TEAM.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.876
- COMING UP...

19:36.910 --> 19:38.611
YOU THINK
HIS APARTMENT'S OVERPRICED?

19:38.645 --> 19:39.813
- IT IS SO OVERPRICED.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.881
IT'S LIKE THE LAUGHINGSTOCK
OF THE INDUSTRY.

19:41.915 --> 19:44.217
I MEAN, A MONKEY CAN LIST
SOMETHING AT 23 MILLION.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.785
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.959
- WE ARE BACK

19:53.059 --> 19:54.828
WITH THE<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK REUNION.</i>

19:54.861 --> 19:58.565
NOW, PERHAPS
OUR MOST COLORFUL CAST MEMBER

19:58.598 --> 19:59.632
IS FREDRIK.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.535
HE RARELY EVER TONES IT DOWN,

20:02.569 --> 20:05.772
EVEN WHEN HE'S THROWING
A LITTLE SHADE.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.440
WATCH.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.575
[cell phone rings]

20:08.608 --> 20:11.111
- FREDRIK SPEAKING.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.612
BUSINESS KEEPS GROWING.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.682
EVERY DEVELOPER IN TOWN,
ACTUALLY, THE NATION--

20:15.715 --> 20:16.850
NEBRASKA?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.585
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE NEBRASKA IS--

20:18.618 --> 20:19.619
WANTS TO WORK WITH ME.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.087
WHAA!

20:21.121 --> 20:22.489
[laughing]

20:22.522 --> 20:24.190
AT 14.5 MILLION,

20:24.224 --> 20:26.860
YOU MADE $5 MILLION.
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

20:26.893 --> 20:29.095
WHY DO YOU CALL ME
IF YOU'RE GONNA QUESTION ME?

20:29.129 --> 20:30.330
- YOU'VE BROKEN RECORDS BEFORE.
- THIS IS LIKE A TWILIGHT ZONE.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.032
THIS IS A RECORD!

20:32.065 --> 20:33.933
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND?

20:33.967 --> 20:36.369
I DID IT. 8.8 MILLION,
ALL CASH.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.038
"5.350 IS A GO."

20:38.071 --> 20:40.073
- WHOO!
- [laughs]

20:40.106 --> 20:41.875
- WAIT A MINUTE.
- I'VE DONE IT AGAIN!

20:41.908 --> 20:43.309
- THIS GUY'S NUTS.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.246
- WE HAVE A DEAL?
- WE HAVE A DEAL.

20:46.279 --> 20:49.683
- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.585
ALMOST $20 MILLION.
- I AM THRILLED.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.720
- CHA-CHA-CHA-CHA-CHING!

20:53.753 --> 20:57.023
- WE HAVE A DEAL.
CHEERS!

20:57.057 --> 20:58.692
- WIN, WIN, WIN!

20:58.725 --> 21:02.395
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A $180-MILLION SELLOUT.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.496
I LOVE YOU.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.498
[bell ringing]
- EVERYBODY STOP.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.067
GUYS, 100 MILLION.

21:07.067 --> 21:09.235
WHO SELLS $100 MILLION
IN TWO WEEKS?

21:09.269 --> 21:10.503
- US.

21:10.537 --> 21:14.574
- I LOVE NEW YORK!

21:14.607 --> 21:16.810
- YOU COULD BE
A SILENT FILM ACTOR.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.278
- [laughs]
- YOU'RE VERY--

21:18.311 --> 21:19.813
YOU HAVE
A VERY EXPRESSIVE FACE.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.082
- I MEAN, I'M SO CRAZY.
YEAH. NO.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.884
- JERRY FROM CALIFORNIA SAID,
"HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU

21:24.918 --> 21:27.187
THAT YOU LOOK LIKE
WILL FERRELL'S BETTER TWIN?"

21:27.220 --> 21:29.389
- YES, I'VE HEARD THAT.
- YOU HAVE?

21:29.422 --> 21:31.758
I'VE ALSO HEARD THE--
THE GRINCH I HEAR A LOT.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.393
- THE GRINCH?
- BECAUSE I HAVE, I GUESS,

21:33.426 --> 21:35.762
A FACE THAT REALLY MOVES.

21:35.795 --> 21:39.199
- RIGHT. TINA FROM
CHESTER SPRINGS, PENNSYLVANIA,

21:39.232 --> 21:41.167
SAYS, "FREDRIK, HAVE YOU EVER
FELT BAD OR EMBARRASSED

21:41.201 --> 21:43.770
AFTER ONE OF YOUR FLIP-OUTS
AT A CLIENT?"

21:43.803 --> 21:46.639
- IN THE BEGINNING OF MY CAREER,
I LOOKED AT EVERY CLIENT

21:46.673 --> 21:48.975
LIKE HE OR SHE WAS SITTING
ON SORT OF A THRONE.

21:49.009 --> 21:50.577
I WAS
SO INCREDIBLY EXCITED

21:50.610 --> 21:53.480
JUST TO BE IN THE MOMENT
WITH THE CLIENT,

21:53.513 --> 21:56.916
SO I JUST TOOK WHATEVER,
"10 MILLION! OKAY, 10 MILLION."

21:56.950 --> 21:58.651
BUT NOW,
I PUT MY FOOT DOWN,

21:58.685 --> 22:02.655
AND I THINK THE SHOW SHOWS
THAT ALL WE HAVE IS OUR TIME.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.759
AND WHEN WE OVERPRICE SOMETHING
AND WHEN WE JUST SAY YES

22:05.792 --> 22:09.195
TO THE CLIENT, IT CAN COST US
YEARS OF LOST TIME,

22:09.229 --> 22:11.064
AND IT'S ACTUALLY DOING
THE CLIENT A DISSERVICE.

22:11.064 --> 22:13.433
SO I ALWAYS TRY TO, LIKE--
MM.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.435
- WHAT'S THE SECRET
OF YOUR SUCCESS?

22:15.468 --> 22:17.537
- WELL, THE UNGLAMOROUS ANSWER
IS THAT

22:17.570 --> 22:19.806
YOU WORK HARDER
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

22:19.839 --> 22:23.309
REALLY, I TRY TO GET IN
THE OFFICE EARLY OR LEAVE LATER.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.278
I DO--ONCE AGAIN,
WHERE WE STARTED--

22:25.311 --> 22:27.580
I HAVE MY TEAM, WHICH, THEY'RE
ALL REALLY AMAZING PEOPLE.

22:27.614 --> 22:28.648
REALLY AMAZING, YEAH.

22:28.682 --> 22:29.816
- HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE ON YOUR TEAM?

22:29.849 --> 22:31.851
- WE HAVE 12 IN NEW YORK,

22:31.885 --> 22:34.754
AND THEN I HAVE 55
IN SCANDINAVIA.

22:34.788 --> 22:36.489
- WOW, AND HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE ON YOUR TEAM?

22:36.523 --> 22:38.291
- TWO, ACTUALLY.

22:38.324 --> 22:39.693
- HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE ON YOUR TEAM?

22:39.726 --> 22:41.895
- TEN HERE
AND THEN FIVE IN L.A.

22:41.928 --> 22:44.531
- YOU NEVER TAKE VACATIONS.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.599
- I TAKE SOME,
BUT NOT FOR A LONG TIME.

22:46.633 --> 22:47.600
I DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.002
I'M NOT AS RICH AS HE IS

22:49.102 --> 22:51.338
TO, LIKE, TAKE, YOU KNOW, WEEKS
AND WEEKS ON END TO GO AWAY,

22:51.371 --> 22:53.707
UM, TO HIDE
BEHIND MY TEAM.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.643
SO, YOU KNOW, I HAVE
A LOT OF WORK THAT I NEED TO DO.

22:56.676 --> 22:57.777
AND--
- SO YOU THINK FREDRIK

22:57.811 --> 23:00.714
KEEPS HIS TEAM HIDDEN
BEHIND THE SCENES?

23:00.747 --> 23:02.949
- I--NO. I MEAN, HE HAS--
HE HAS A TEAM. I JUST--

23:03.049 --> 23:04.918
YOU KNOW, HE TAKES--HE TAKES
ALL THE CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.087
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU THINK
HE'S A GRANDSTANDER.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.055
- DEFINITELY.
- 11 NORTH MOORE.

23:09.089 --> 23:11.324
IF YOU REMEMBER THE EPISODE,
THAT, I THINK,

23:11.358 --> 23:14.194
WAS MOST--THE MAJORITY
OF THE MEMBERS IN MY TEAM,

23:14.227 --> 23:17.597
AND DIDN'T YOU SEE
ALL OF THEM WORKING HARD?

23:17.630 --> 23:18.598
YEAH.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.967
- FREDRIK, YOU SOLD
$120 MILLION

23:21.067 --> 23:22.469
IN A HIGH-RISE
THIS SEASON.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.837
WAS THAT THE BIGGEST DEAL
YOU'VE EVER CLOSED?

23:23.870 --> 23:26.539
- NO. NO.
IT WAS THE QUICKEST.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.309
I MEAN, THAT WAS--IT WAS UNUSUAL
TO BE ABLE TO SELL

23:29.342 --> 23:31.077
THAT MUCH IN A WEEK
OR TEN DAYS.

23:31.111 --> 23:32.579
IT WAS VERY, VERY QUICK

23:32.612 --> 23:34.714
AND VERY EXCITING,
TO SAY THE LEAST.

23:34.748 --> 23:39.586
- DO YOU THINK THAT RYAN
IS JEALOUS OF YOUR CAREER?

23:39.619 --> 23:41.955
- EVERYONE KEEPS SAYING THAT
TO ME. I DON'T KNOW.

23:41.988 --> 23:45.291
I MEAN, WHOMEVER SELLS THE MOST
IS GONNA ALWAYS BE THE WINNER.

23:45.325 --> 23:47.494
FOR THREE SEASONS NOW--
- I DISAGREE ON THAT.

23:47.527 --> 23:48.728
- CAN I FINISH?
FOR THREE SEASONS NOW,

23:48.762 --> 23:51.164
I HAVE OUTSOLD
THE OTHER TWO GUYS COMBINED,

23:51.197 --> 23:53.600
AND I SOLD TWICE AS MUCH.
THAT'S A FACT.

23:53.633 --> 23:54.601
- NUMBERS DON'T MAKE YOU
ANY BETTER,

23:54.634 --> 23:56.102
AND THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM.

23:56.136 --> 23:58.104
BECAUSE OF THE NUMBERS AND WHAT
YOU'VE BECOME IN YOUR CAREER,

23:58.104 --> 23:59.506
YOU FEEL SO MUCH GREATER
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.041
- NO, I TRY TO ANSWER A QUESTION
IF--

24:01.041 --> 24:02.509
- AND YOU'RE NOT.
- IF I THINK HE'S JEALOUS.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.477
I DIDN'T SAY WHO'S BETTER.
- YEAH, BUT IT'S JUST,

24:04.511 --> 24:05.712
YOU KNOW--
- I THINK--I THINK

24:05.745 --> 24:07.213
IF YOU'RE GONNA
BE ON THIS SHOW

24:07.247 --> 24:09.349
AND YOU'RE GONNA COMPETE,
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE.

24:09.382 --> 24:12.185
- DO YOU THINK
RYAN'S A GOOD BROKER?

24:12.218 --> 24:13.620
- I THINK BOTH OF THEM
ARE REALLY GOOD.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.955
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, THEY'RE
SO MUCH YOUNGER THAN I AM.

24:16.056 --> 24:19.325
WHEN I WAS THEIR AGE,
I WASN'T DOING AS WELL

24:19.359 --> 24:20.960
AS THEY ARE.
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?

24:21.061 --> 24:22.062
- 37.
- OKAY.

24:22.062 --> 24:24.264
- YOU'VE BEEN 37
SINCE I MET YOU.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.800
- I WAS BORN 1977.
ANYWAY--

24:26.833 --> 24:29.135
- YOU THINK FREDRIK LIES
ABOUT HIS AGE?

24:29.169 --> 24:31.805
- I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT
GONNA MAKE THAT ACCUSATION.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.673
- WELL, YOU JUST DID, ACTUALLY.
- YOU JUST DID.

24:33.707 --> 24:35.442
- I'D SAY--I WAS SAYING
SINCE THE DAY I MET YOU,

24:35.475 --> 24:36.810
I THINK YOU'VE BEEN
THE SAME EXACT AGE.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.144
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENS.
- NO.

24:38.178 --> 24:39.979
NO, EVEN WHEN--
- IT'S A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.681
- WHEN WE STARTED FILMING,
I WAS 33, I THINK.

24:41.715 --> 24:43.149
- MM.

24:43.183 --> 24:45.251
- I HAVE MY--I HAVE MY--
- I'D HAVE FAKE I.D.s TOO...

24:45.285 --> 24:46.453
- OKAY, OKAY.

24:46.486 --> 24:47.687
- ESPECIALLY IF I WAS NOT
FROM THIS COUNTRY.

24:47.721 --> 24:49.589
- WOW. WOW, RYAN.
THIS IS GREAT.

24:49.622 --> 24:53.560
OKAY, I LOVE IT.
I'M ACTUALLY 55, EVERYONE.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.395
- WELL, I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK
AT HOW EACH OF YOU FARED

24:55.428 --> 24:56.429
THIS SEASON.

24:56.463 --> 24:58.398
HERE'S HOW THINGS WENT DOWN

24:58.431 --> 25:01.801
FOR THE ONE AND ONLY
CHARMINATOR.

25:01.835 --> 25:04.771
- IF THEY WANT THIS HOUSE, THEY
NEED TO JUMP ON IT RIGHT NOW.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.473
THIS YEAR, I'M NOT TAKING
[bleep] FROM ANYONE.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.041
$7 MILLION IS THE NUMBER.

25:08.041 --> 25:11.111
WHEN SOMEONE PUTS $2.5 MILLION
IN YOUR HAND,

25:11.144 --> 25:13.713
YOU CLOSE YOUR HAND.

25:13.747 --> 25:15.515
YES!
WHEN IT COMES TO REAL ESTATE,

25:15.548 --> 25:18.918
THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE TO WORK
THAN NEW YORK CITY.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.286
WHAT KIND OF PRICE
DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

25:20.320 --> 25:21.388
- 23 MILLION.

25:21.421 --> 25:23.490
- LET'S DO IT!
- ALL RIGHT.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.825
- THIS YEAR, MY SALES ARE BIGGER
THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN.

25:25.859 --> 25:28.495
[dance music]

25:28.528 --> 25:30.063
- IT'S A GREAT PARTY.

25:30.063 --> 25:31.431
- IT'S NOT A PARTY.
IT'S A VERY SERIOUS OPEN HOUSE.

25:31.464 --> 25:34.334
- [laughs]

25:34.367 --> 25:36.603
- HOW SICK IS THIS?

25:36.636 --> 25:38.772
THAT'S RIGHT,
1.21 GIGAWATTS, BITCH.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.507
I LOVE THE '80s.
THAT'S RIGHT!

25:40.540 --> 25:42.342
[engine revs]

25:42.375 --> 25:44.644
- SCENE 102, TAKE 1.

25:44.678 --> 25:46.146
- WHEN IT COMES
TO SELLING APARTMENTS,

25:46.179 --> 25:47.914
NO BROKER IN THE WORLD SPENDS

25:47.947 --> 25:49.849
TENS AND TENS AND TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON IT.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.084
NO ONE DOES THAT.
NO ONE DOES THAT...

25:51.084 --> 25:53.353
OH, THERE IT GOES!
EXCEPT FOR ME.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.088
PRETTY SURE THAT'S, LIKE,
$5,000 A MINUTE.

25:55.088 --> 25:56.222
LET'S HOPE
THEY COME BACK.

25:56.256 --> 25:57.757
PENTHOUSE ONE
FOR 23 MILLION

25:57.791 --> 25:59.292
IS ON THE MARKET NOW!

25:59.325 --> 26:01.361
THERE'S ONLY THREE THINGS
I KNOW.

26:01.394 --> 26:04.464
ONE IS THAT 2.6 IS THE RIGHT
NUMBER FOR THIS APARTMENT.

26:04.497 --> 26:06.633
TWO IS THAT I'M VERY GOOD
AT WHAT I DO,

26:06.666 --> 26:08.368
AND THREE, THAT YOU ARE
DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS.

26:08.401 --> 26:12.439
AH, THE CHARMINATOR
JUST BROKE THROUGH.

26:12.472 --> 26:14.607
MAYBE WE SHOULD SIT CLOSER,
RIGHT?

26:14.641 --> 26:16.176
YOU HAVE A GREAT BUILDING HERE.
- DO YOU REALIZE

26:16.209 --> 26:17.477
YOUR HAND IS ON ME?
- IS IT?

26:17.510 --> 26:18.545
- MM-HMM.
- DID YOU MIND IT?

26:18.578 --> 26:20.880
- [laughs]
OH, STOP IT.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.082
- 6.1.

26:22.115 --> 26:23.283
- WE HAVE A DEAL.

26:23.316 --> 26:24.584
- AWESOME.
I FEEL GOOD.

26:24.617 --> 26:27.954
I AM
A PHENOMENAL REAL ESTATE AGENT.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.056
THANK YOU.

26:30.056 --> 26:33.093
- I WAS ACTUALLY
QUITE AMUSED WATCHING YOU

26:33.126 --> 26:35.428
WATCH THAT PACKAGE, FREDRIK.
- YEP.

26:35.462 --> 26:37.263
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING THAT?

26:37.297 --> 26:39.866
- NO. I MEAN, I-I-I THINK
IT'S VERY AMUSING.

26:39.899 --> 26:41.868
- WHAT'S AMUSING ABOUT IT?

26:41.901 --> 26:45.672
- I DON'T AGREE
WITH ALL HIS DEALS SOMETIMES,

26:45.705 --> 26:47.107
BUT HE DOESN'T AGREE
ON MY DEALS.

26:47.140 --> 26:49.576
- RYAN, WAS THAT 50 GRAND WORTH
IT, MAKING THAT COMMERCIAL...

26:49.609 --> 26:51.678
- FOR ME? YES.
- FOR THE SKY GARAGE?

26:51.711 --> 26:54.080
- ABSOLUTELY. IT WAS PROBABLY
THE BEST PIECE OF MARKETING

26:54.080 --> 26:57.450
I'VE EVER DONE, EVER, AND I
DON'T KNOW A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE

26:57.484 --> 26:59.185
THAT HAVE THE BALLS
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

26:59.219 --> 27:00.754
AND I GO INTO LISTING PITCHES
ALL THE TIME.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.423
AND EVERYONE SAYS
THE SAME EXACT THING,

27:03.456 --> 27:05.258
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON WHO LOOKS
LIKE YOU ACTUALLY CARE

27:05.291 --> 27:07.127
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SELLING,
THE ONLY PERSON

27:07.160 --> 27:09.029
WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
SOMETHING EMOTIONALLY INVESTED

27:09.029 --> 27:10.830
INTO OUR PROCESS

27:10.864 --> 27:12.632
AND YOU'RE WILLING TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.668
AND I DO THAT.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK

27:14.701 --> 27:16.603
OF MUSIC VIDEOS
AND COMMERCIALS

27:16.636 --> 27:18.738
TO SELL PROPERTIES?
- HE DOESN'T NEED TO DO IT.

27:18.772 --> 27:21.574
HE HAS A 74-PERSON TEAM, SO
HE CAN GO TO TAHITI. IT'S FINE.

27:21.608 --> 27:23.843
- I THINK IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY,
AND I THINK IT'S TOO GIMMICKY.

27:23.877 --> 27:28.148
LIKE, WHAT'S SO INTERESTING,
I THINK, ABOUT YOUR SKY GARAGE

27:28.181 --> 27:30.483
MUSIC VIDEO WAS, THEY DIDN'T
EVEN SHOW THE APARTMENT.

27:30.517 --> 27:33.720
I MEAN, 90% OF THE VIDEO

27:33.753 --> 27:37.557
WAS A COUPLE DRIVING A CAR
AND A HELICOPTER.

27:37.590 --> 27:39.225
AND, I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO--
- THAT'S WHAT I LIKED ABOUT IT.

27:39.259 --> 27:41.828
- THAT'S WHY IT'S NEVER GONNA
HELP SELL THE PROPERTY

27:41.861 --> 27:43.363
THAT'S OVERPRICED
TO BEGIN WITH.

27:43.396 --> 27:45.565
- SO YOU THINK
HIS APARTMENT'S OVERPRICED?

27:45.598 --> 27:47.467
- IT IS SO OVERPRICED THAT

27:47.500 --> 27:49.769
IT'S LIKE THE LAUGHINGSTOCK
OF THE INDUSTRY,

27:49.803 --> 27:52.572
AND EVERYONE THAT'S
IN NEW YORK REAL ESTATE

27:52.605 --> 27:54.441
KNOWS HOW OVERPRICED IT IS,
SO...

27:54.474 --> 27:56.076
- IT'S ON THE MARKET
FOR HOW MUCH?

27:56.109 --> 27:57.610
- 23.

27:57.644 --> 28:00.213
- AND IT'S WORTH, LIKE, 15.
- I DON'T--I MEAN--

28:00.246 --> 28:01.614
- IN OUR CAREERS,

28:01.648 --> 28:03.750
EVERYBODY HAS TOLD US
THAT WE'VE OVERPRICED SOMETHING.

28:03.783 --> 28:05.352
EVERYBODY HAS TOLD US
THAT WE CANNOT DO IT.

28:05.385 --> 28:07.020
AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
UNTIL WE DO.

28:07.020 --> 28:09.022
- WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THE VIDEO?

28:09.022 --> 28:13.026
- UH, WITH ALL RESPECT,
I AGREE WITH--WITH FREDRIK.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.628
I THINK--YOU KNOW,
I'M SURE THAT YOU COULDN'T FILM

28:15.662 --> 28:17.664
INSIDE THE APARTMENT BECAUSE
THE APARTMENT IS NOT FINISHED,

28:17.697 --> 28:20.700
BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW,
IF THE STORY WOULD HAVE COME IN

28:20.734 --> 28:22.268
AND SHOWED THE AMENITIES
IN THE BUILDING,

28:22.302 --> 28:24.137
I THINK, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TAKING
THESE PEOPLE INTO THIS WORLD.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.939
- THAT'S--THAT'S FINE.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.273
- REMEMBER, PEOPLE WANT TO--
- I UNDERSTAND.

28:27.307 --> 28:29.109
THERE'S 35,000
REAL ESTATE AGENTS IN THE CITY,

28:29.142 --> 28:30.643
YOU ALL CAN BE BORING.
- BUT REMEMBER--

28:30.677 --> 28:31.811
- LISTEN. THE APARTMENT
WAS REALLY, REALLY INTERESTING,

28:31.845 --> 28:32.879
SO WHEN IT CAME UP--

28:32.912 --> 28:34.381
- I DON'T THINK
IT WAS INTERESTING.

28:34.414 --> 28:35.648
I THINK IT WAS OVERPRICED.
- THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT.

28:35.682 --> 28:37.050
THIS IS GONNA BE
REALLY INTERESTING.

28:37.050 --> 28:38.151
- AND IT'S HURTING
THE CREDIBILITY OF THE SHOW

28:38.184 --> 28:40.587
AND ME AS A BROKER,
HAVING IT ON THE SHOW.

28:40.620 --> 28:42.422
- IT'S HURTING THE CREDIBILITY
OF THE SHOW--

28:42.455 --> 28:44.724
RYAN IS?
- BECAUSE IT'S

28:44.758 --> 28:46.126
A $14-MILLION APARTMENT
THAT'S--

28:46.159 --> 28:49.229
I MEAN, A MONKEY CAN
LIST SOMETHING AT 23 MILLION

28:49.262 --> 28:51.765
AND DO 11 EPISODES
AND DO A CUTE LITTLE VIDEO.

28:51.798 --> 28:53.900
- I'M SORRY THERE WASN'T
A HURRICANE THAT I COULD USE

28:53.933 --> 28:56.236
AS A COP-OUT
TO GET OUT OF A BIG LISTING.

28:56.269 --> 28:57.771
- AND IT'S BORING TO WATCH,
'CAUSE THERE'S NOT EVEN

28:57.804 --> 28:59.205
A NEGOTIATION.
THERE'S NOT EVEN AN OFFER.

28:59.239 --> 29:00.740
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- I'D MUCH RATHER SEE

29:00.774 --> 29:01.875
AN APARTMENT BE BUILT
THAT IS INTERESTING

29:01.908 --> 29:03.343
THAT NO ONE'S
EVER SEEN BEFORE...

29:03.376 --> 29:04.611
- BUT WE NEVER SAW IT GET BUILT.
WE NEVER SAW IT GET BUILT.

29:04.644 --> 29:06.012
- THAN SPEND EPISODE
AFTER EPISODE

29:06.012 --> 29:07.480
WITH SOMEONE SHOWING UP
WITH, LIKE, A LOAF OF BREAD

29:07.514 --> 29:09.015
AND CUTTING IT AND SAYING,
"OH, YOU HAVE AN OFFER!

29:09.015 --> 29:10.016
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!"

29:10.050 --> 29:11.251
- THE TRUTH IS YOU DON'T HAVE--
- WHOO!

29:11.284 --> 29:13.486
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY LISTINGS
OVER 10 MILLION,

29:13.520 --> 29:15.889
SO THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU
TO PROVE THAT,

29:15.922 --> 29:18.825
AND THAT'S WHY, I MEAN, IT'S
NOT--IT'S JUST NOT INTERESTING.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.627
ANYWAY, TO BE CONTINUED.
THE GOOD THING WITH NEW YORK

29:20.660 --> 29:23.363
IS THAT EVERY SINGLE DEAL
IS PUBLIC INFORMATION.

29:23.396 --> 29:26.099
PEOPLE CAN FOLLOW
THIS STORY LINE

29:26.132 --> 29:28.335
AND SEE WHEN IT'S GONNA SELL
AT WHAT PRICE

29:28.368 --> 29:31.204
'CAUSE IT'S ALL PUBLIC,
AND WE'RE GONNA SEE THE ANSWER.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.439
- COMING UP...

29:32.472 --> 29:33.840
- PERSONALLY, I THINK
IT'LL BE THE STRAW

29:33.873 --> 29:35.241
THAT BREAKS THE CAMEL'S BACK.

29:35.275 --> 29:36.943
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.078
- WELL...
- HE MEANS THAT HE THINKS

29:38.111 --> 29:40.280
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WOULDN'T SURVIVE.

29:40.313 --> 29:41.915
- I'M SO AFRAID
OF LOSING MYSELF AGAIN,

29:41.948 --> 29:44.217
THAT I'M MISSING OUT ON--

29:44.250 --> 29:47.887
I'VE--MOTHER[bleep].
I'M SORRY.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.863
- FREDRIK, WHERE DOES
YOUR LEG KICK COME FROM?

29:56.896 --> 29:59.265
- UM, WELL, YOU KNOW,

29:59.299 --> 30:00.800
SOME PEOPLE SAY
IT'S<i>KARATE KID</i>THE MOVIE,

30:00.834 --> 30:03.470
BUT IT WAS INVENTED
BEFORE I WATCHED THAT MOVIE.

30:03.503 --> 30:04.904
I'VE DONE IT SINCE I WAS A KID.
- YOU HAVE?

30:04.938 --> 30:06.072
REALLY?
- YEAH.

30:06.106 --> 30:07.073
SINCE I WAS, LIKE,
FOUR YEARS OLD,

30:07.107 --> 30:08.742
ALWAYS HAVE.
ALWAYS HAVE.

30:08.775 --> 30:10.744
NO, I MEAN, THERE'S ONE THING
THAT'S SO EMBARRASSING,

30:10.777 --> 30:12.479
WHICH, I MEAN,
I JUST GOTTA LAUGH AT MYSELF.

30:12.512 --> 30:15.248
FIRST EPISODE OF THIS SEASON,
WHEN I KICK

30:15.281 --> 30:17.751
IN THOSE, LIKE, PINK PANTS--
MAYBE WE CAN SHOW A SLO-MO--

30:17.784 --> 30:20.220
AND THERE'S ACTUALLY
A BIG CRACK IN THE PANTS.

30:20.253 --> 30:22.956
[growls]

30:22.989 --> 30:24.858
AND SOMEONE PUT THIS
IN THE TRAILER OF THE--

30:24.891 --> 30:26.826
OF EVERY SINGLE EPISODE.
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY,

30:26.860 --> 30:28.862
THERE'S A BIG--
I MEAN, I'M JUST, YOU KNOW.

30:28.895 --> 30:30.063
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.365
- [squeals]
- [squeals]

30:38.838 --> 30:40.407
- WELCOME BACK.
I'M ANDY COHEN

30:40.440 --> 30:41.875
HERE WITH THE HOTTEST
REAL ESTATE BROKERS

30:41.908 --> 30:43.643
IN MANHATTAN.

30:43.677 --> 30:46.379
AND IT'S NO SECRET

30:46.413 --> 30:50.050
THAT THE REAL ESTATE GAME
IS ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS.

30:50.083 --> 30:51.718
BUT WHILE THESE GUYS
STRUGGLE TO MANAGE

30:51.751 --> 30:53.319
ALL THEIR BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIPS,

30:53.353 --> 30:56.022
THEY'VE STILL GOTTA JUGGLE
ONE MORE.

30:56.056 --> 30:58.892
PLEASE WELCOME
FREDRIK'S HUSBAND, DEREK,

30:58.925 --> 31:01.861
AND RYAN'S GIRLFRIEND,
EMILIA.

31:01.895 --> 31:03.630
YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
- THANK YOU.

31:03.663 --> 31:04.931
- DEREK.
- HI, ANDY.

31:04.964 --> 31:05.932
- YOU KNOW I THINK
YOU'RE THE MOST PERFECT MAN

31:05.965 --> 31:07.300
IN AMERICA, RIGHT?

31:07.334 --> 31:09.669
- NO, I DIDN'T, BUT THANK YOU.
- IT'S TRUE.

31:09.703 --> 31:12.305
WELL, FOR FREDRIK AND DEREK,
FIRST CAME LOVE,

31:12.339 --> 31:13.440
THEN CAME MARRIAGE,

31:13.473 --> 31:15.942
BUT THE BABY
IN THE BABY CARRIAGE?

31:15.975 --> 31:18.545
NOT SO MUCH.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

31:18.578 --> 31:22.082
- BABE, WE NEED TO START, LIKE,
NARROWING DOWN

31:22.082 --> 31:23.717
WHO WE WANT
AS OUR OVEN.

31:23.750 --> 31:26.753
- WELL, I THINK--
ARE WE ACTUALLY READY?

31:26.786 --> 31:28.788
- YOU DON'T WANT TO NOW?
- I MEAN, IT'S QUITE SCARY,

31:28.822 --> 31:30.657
IF I'M HONEST.

31:30.690 --> 31:32.592
- WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
IF I'M READY?

31:32.625 --> 31:34.627
I THOUGHT WE WERE READY.

31:36.930 --> 31:39.866
- AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THAT
OPTION'S ON THE BACK BURNER.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.868
- I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
WHAT I'M HEARING.

31:41.901 --> 31:42.869
I'M NOT MAKING A DECISION.

31:42.902 --> 31:45.005
HE IS FOR US.

31:45.105 --> 31:46.172
- I WANT TO ENJOY PAINTING

31:46.206 --> 31:49.009
AND TRYING TO GET MYSELF
UP TO A PLACE

31:49.109 --> 31:50.310
WHERE I FEEL INDEPENDENT.
- I UNDERSTAND

31:50.343 --> 31:52.779
YOU WANT TO, LIKE--
YOU WANT ALL THOSE THINGS,

31:52.812 --> 31:54.314
BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO.

31:54.347 --> 31:57.283
- I DON'T WANT TO BE SOMEBODY
THAT BECOMES A HOUSEWIFE.

31:57.317 --> 31:59.486
- [sighs]
EVEN THOUGH DEREK HAS TOLD ME

31:59.519 --> 32:01.821
HE'S NOT READY FOR A BABY YET,
I'M PLUNGING FORWARD.

32:01.855 --> 32:03.356
I CANNOT LET IT GO.

32:03.390 --> 32:06.426
DEREK SAYS HE'S COMING HOME
WITH A SURPRISE.

32:06.459 --> 32:08.895
MAYBE HE REALIZED
THAT IT IS TIME

32:08.928 --> 32:10.096
TO HAVE A BABY.

32:10.130 --> 32:11.498
- I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

32:11.531 --> 32:12.966
- IS IT
WHAT I THINK IT IS?

32:13.066 --> 32:15.802
'CAUSE OF THE--

32:15.835 --> 32:17.270
- OH.

32:17.303 --> 32:18.905
- BABE.
- OH.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.306
- AS SOON
AS I SEE THE DOG,

32:20.340 --> 32:23.777
I REALIZE THAT EVERY
LITTLE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY

32:23.810 --> 32:25.645
WHEN IT COMES TO MILLA
IS FINALLY CLOSED.

32:25.679 --> 32:27.614
YOU SAID IT WAS GONNA BE
A SURPRISE.

32:27.647 --> 32:30.450
I THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA HAVE MILLA.

32:34.454 --> 32:37.290
- YOU GOT VERY UPSET
WATCHING THAT.

32:37.323 --> 32:40.994
- WELL, UM, BECAUSE WE--
WE, UM...

32:41.094 --> 32:42.962
SORRY. IT'S--
WE ARE NOT IN A--

32:42.996 --> 32:45.098
WE'RE NOT IN AGREEMENT ON THE--
ON THE ISSUE,

32:45.131 --> 32:46.466
AND IT'S NOT GONNA
COME TO AN AGREEMENT.

32:46.499 --> 32:48.601
AND I THINK
WATCHING IT ALL AGAIN,

32:48.635 --> 32:52.005
YOU SEE THAT, UM...

32:52.105 --> 32:54.107
HE DOESN'T WANT IT.
I WANT IT.

32:54.107 --> 32:56.943
AND, UM, THAT'S THAT.
I MEAN--

32:56.976 --> 32:59.646
- I JUST THINK
THAT I'M MORE REALISTIC

32:59.679 --> 33:01.915
ABOUT US BEING PARENTS.

33:01.948 --> 33:04.918
I DON'T THINK
FRED'S ACTUALLY EVER SPENT,

33:04.951 --> 33:07.220
LET'S JUST SAY,
24 HOURS

33:07.253 --> 33:09.255
WITH A NEWLY BORN BABY

33:09.289 --> 33:11.224
THAT YOU'RE
TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR,

33:11.257 --> 33:12.959
EVERY SECOND
OF THAT 24 HOURS.

33:13.059 --> 33:14.861
- MY POINT OF VIEW
IS, LIKE, YOU--

33:14.894 --> 33:17.063
WE WOULD
SOLVE IT TOGETHER.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.765
I'VE SAID THAT TO HIM
SO MANY TIMES.

33:18.798 --> 33:21.468
LIKE, WHO HAS FIGURED THIS OUT
BEFORE IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS?

33:21.501 --> 33:23.536
- I KNOW HOW YOU ARE
AS A PERSON, YOUR CHARACTER.

33:23.570 --> 33:26.473
YOU'RE DRIVEN, YOU'RE HUNGRY,
YOU'RE MOTIVATED, AND YOU JUST

33:26.506 --> 33:28.541
WANT TO GET EVERY SINGLE SELL
THAT YOU POSSIBLY CAN.

33:28.575 --> 33:31.711
YOU--YOU SQUEEZE IN
EVERY MEETING, EVERY--

33:31.745 --> 33:34.147
I MEAN, YOUR--
YOUR AGENDA'S PACKED.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.882
- MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO WORK
AS MUCH.

33:35.915 --> 33:37.283
- YOU'RE NOT BEING REALISTIC.

33:37.317 --> 33:40.120
I WILL BE THE ONE THERE
WITH THE BABY ALL THE TIME.

33:40.153 --> 33:42.122
SO, YOU KNOW,
SAY GOOD-BYE TO MY CAREER.

33:42.155 --> 33:44.624
- MY BROTHER
HAS THREE CHILDREN,

33:44.657 --> 33:47.293
AND LIKE MOST SUCCESSFUL COUPLES
OUT THERE, THEY MAKE IT WORK.

33:47.327 --> 33:48.628
- YEAH, THEY MAKE IT WORK.

33:48.661 --> 33:50.530
SO THEN WHAT ARE WE
GONNA SACRIFICE FOR THAT?

33:50.563 --> 33:52.098
- A LOT.
- EXACTLY.

33:52.098 --> 33:53.900
SO PROBABLY--
- AND IT'S GONNA BE REWARDING.

33:53.933 --> 33:57.103
- YEAH, SO--
- THE ONE MOST REWARDING THING

33:57.103 --> 33:59.139
YOU AND I WILL EVER DO TOGETHER.
- I WILL SACRIFICE.

33:59.172 --> 34:00.874
WILL YOU SACRIFICE
ON YOUR SIDE?

34:00.907 --> 34:04.044
NO, I DON'T THINK YOU WILL.
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO.

34:04.077 --> 34:07.147
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE CAPABLE OF,
AT THIS POINT IN YOUR LIFE...

34:07.180 --> 34:10.550
- [sighs]
- SACRIFICING YOUR TIME AND--

34:10.583 --> 34:13.319
ALL THE NEW DEVELOPMENT WORK
THAT YOU HAVE--IT'S SO CRAZY.

34:13.353 --> 34:15.622
FREDRIK, HOW ARE YOU EVER GONNA
CUT BACK AND SAY NO?

34:15.655 --> 34:17.524
YOU COMMITTED ALREADY
FOR HOW MANY YEARS?

34:17.557 --> 34:19.626
YOU COMMITTED
TO ALL THESE PROJECTS,

34:19.659 --> 34:21.695
AND THEY JUST SUCK AWAY
ALL YOUR TIME AND ENERGY.

34:21.728 --> 34:23.563
- YEAH, BUT IT WILL
WORK ITSELF OUT.

34:23.596 --> 34:25.732
EVEN IF WE PUSH A BUTTON,
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY FOR US,

34:25.765 --> 34:28.101
THAT'S HOW WE HAVE TO DO IT
AND START THE PROCESS,

34:28.134 --> 34:29.869
IT STILL WILL TAKE,
LIKE, 18 MONTHS

34:29.903 --> 34:31.304
BEFORE WE--SHE WOULD
ACTUALLY ARRIVE IN OUR ARMS.

34:31.338 --> 34:32.605
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
- THERE'S A HEAVY LOAD

34:32.639 --> 34:34.541
IN OUR HOUSE, AND I THINK
IT'LL BE THE STRAW

34:34.574 --> 34:37.177
THAT BREAKS THE CAMEL'S BACK.
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

34:37.210 --> 34:38.978
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

34:39.079 --> 34:40.580
- WELL...
- HE MEANS THAT HE THINKS

34:40.613 --> 34:42.215
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WOULDN'T SURVIVE.

34:42.248 --> 34:46.286
- YEAH.

34:46.319 --> 34:48.722
- YOU--YOU BOTH WORK
VERY HARD.

34:48.755 --> 34:52.392
DO YOU SEE YOUR LIVES OPENING UP
FOR A CHILD

34:52.425 --> 34:54.294
ANYTIME SOON?
- I DON'T--

34:54.327 --> 34:56.096
YOU'RE ASKING ME?
- I'M ASKING BOTH OF YOU, YEAH.

34:56.096 --> 34:57.664
- UH, WELL, LISTEN.

34:57.697 --> 34:59.332
I WANT CHILDREN.
I'M A FAMILY MAN.

34:59.366 --> 35:02.802
BUT I NEED TO BE READY.
I CAN'T JUST JUMP RIGHT ONTO IT.

35:02.836 --> 35:04.804
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, RYAN?
- I AGREE WITH FREDRIK.

35:04.838 --> 35:07.841
I THINK--I THINK
WE FIGURE IT OUT.

35:07.874 --> 35:11.144
YOU KNOW, I WASN'T LOOKING
FOR A RELATIONSHIP

35:11.177 --> 35:12.946
WHEN I MET EMILIA.

35:13.046 --> 35:15.749
AND, UM--
- THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

35:15.782 --> 35:17.517
- YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN?

35:17.550 --> 35:19.786
I WASN'T LOOKING FOR A
RELATIONSHIP WHEN I MET EMILIA,

35:19.819 --> 35:22.655
AND I CLEARLY
WAS NOT GOOD AT IT

35:22.689 --> 35:26.126
AT THE BEGINNING,
BUT I, YOU KNOW--

35:26.159 --> 35:28.294
AND TO TAKE FREDRIK'S WORDS,
I MEAN, I-I FIGURED IT OUT.

35:28.328 --> 35:29.562
I MEAN, SHE'S NOT--
- RIGHT.

35:29.596 --> 35:30.797
- SHE'S NOT A LITTLE BABY.
I MEAN, SOMETIMES.

35:30.830 --> 35:33.066
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I LOOK AT HER FACE,

35:33.099 --> 35:34.567
AND I MAKE IT WORK.

35:34.601 --> 35:36.970
- I PERSONALLY FEEL
THAT IT'S NOT THE TIME

35:37.070 --> 35:39.139
THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE
FOR THE CHILDREN.

35:39.172 --> 35:40.273
I FEEL LIKE IT'S THE TIME

35:40.306 --> 35:41.675
THAT DEREK WANTS TO PUT
IN HIS OWN LIFE.

35:41.708 --> 35:43.543
HE JUST CAME,
AND THIS IS HIS COUNTRY,

35:43.576 --> 35:45.345
AND, YOU KNOW,
YOU WANT A CHILD,

35:45.378 --> 35:47.747
BUT HE REALLY--
HE MAY REALLY WANT--

35:47.781 --> 35:49.416
HE'S CLEARLY GREAT WITH KIDS--
WE SAW IT ON THAT EPISODE--

35:49.449 --> 35:50.884
BUT THIS IS NOT YOUR TIME
TO DO SO.

35:50.917 --> 35:53.553
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE JUST STARTING
TO BECOME A GREAT ARTIST,

35:53.586 --> 35:54.954
AND YOU'RE GETTING TO KNOW
YOURSELF AS AN ARTIST,

35:54.988 --> 35:57.390
AND YOU'RE EXPLORING THIS WORLD,
AND YOU'RE BOOMING,

35:57.424 --> 35:59.526
AND THIS IS YOUR LIFE TOO.

35:59.559 --> 36:01.027
- CYNTHIA FROM BEAVER FALLS,
PENNSYLVANIA,

36:01.061 --> 36:02.862
SAID, "DEREK, I'M A HOUSEWIFE
AND MOTHER

36:02.896 --> 36:04.297
"AND VERY HAPPY
AND FULFILLED.

36:04.330 --> 36:07.033
IT'S THE HARDEST AND MOST
REWARDING JOB IN THE WORLD."

36:07.033 --> 36:08.435
- HOUSEWIFE.
- "WHY DO YOU HAVE

36:08.468 --> 36:11.638
SUCH AN AVERSION TO BEING
A 'HOUSEHUSBAND'?"

36:11.671 --> 36:13.039
- SHE SAID HOUSEWIFE, YES.

36:13.073 --> 36:15.542
I THINK THAT'S
FROM A HOUSEWIFE POINT OF VIEW.

36:15.575 --> 36:18.144
SHE HAS HER HEART AND SOUL
INTO THAT ROLE

36:18.178 --> 36:20.313
OF BEING A HOUSEWIFE,
WHEREAS I DON'T.

36:20.347 --> 36:22.248
SO HOW CAN I EVER BE HAPPY
WITH MYSELF?

36:22.282 --> 36:23.316
- RIGHT.

36:23.350 --> 36:24.317
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
A HOUSEWIFE.

36:24.351 --> 36:26.920
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO, EVER.

36:29.823 --> 36:31.324
AND I HAVE TO BE HONEST
ABOUT IT,

36:31.358 --> 36:35.729
IS THAT I JUST--
I DON'T HAVE THE DESIRE NOW

36:35.762 --> 36:36.830
TO HAVE A CHILD,

36:36.863 --> 36:39.065
AND THE WAY I FEEL,

36:39.065 --> 36:43.069
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M EVER
GONNA WANT TO HAVE A CHILD.

36:43.103 --> 36:45.605
SO--AND, YOU KNOW,

36:45.638 --> 36:47.073
FREDRIK'S STILL DREAMING
ABOUT IT

36:47.107 --> 36:49.943
AND FANTASIZING ABOUT...
- YEAH, BECAUSE WHEN I MET YOU--

36:49.976 --> 36:52.078
- THIS PERFECT THING
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

36:52.078 --> 36:56.383
AND I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE THAT AT ALL.

36:56.416 --> 36:57.984
- ON A HAPPIER NOTE,

36:58.084 --> 37:01.354
IT IS USUALLY LOVELY

37:01.388 --> 37:03.356
WATCHING THE TWO OF YOU
TOGETHER.

37:03.390 --> 37:04.791
YOU'RE VERY MUCH IN LOVE.

37:04.824 --> 37:06.659
DEREK, WHAT DO YOU LOVE
ABOUT FREDRIK?

37:06.693 --> 37:08.661
- WHAT DO I LOVE ABOUT HIM?
- YEAH.

37:08.695 --> 37:11.031
- OH, HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,
AND HE'S ALWAYS SUPPORTIVE.

37:11.031 --> 37:12.632
LIKE, HE'S FOREVER SUPPORTIVE
OF ME.

37:12.665 --> 37:16.036
AND, YOU KNOW,

37:16.036 --> 37:18.071
THE LIST IS ENDLESS.

37:18.104 --> 37:20.073
OBVIOUSLY, I DON'T WANT
TO SIT HERE AND, YOU KNOW,

37:20.106 --> 37:22.609
MAKE--MAKE RYAN CRY, BUT--
- [laughs]

37:22.642 --> 37:25.245
YOU COULDN'T,
EVEN IF YOU TRIED.

37:25.278 --> 37:28.348
- BEFORE WE MOVE ON,
ONE LAST QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS.

37:28.381 --> 37:30.517
MINO FROM NEW JERSEY SAID,
"FREDRIK, IF YOUR HUSBAND

37:30.550 --> 37:33.753
DECIDED HE NEVER WANTED KIDS"...
- YEAH.

37:33.787 --> 37:35.355
- "WOULD YOU
CONSIDER DIVORCE?"

37:35.388 --> 37:37.891
- NO. NEVER.

37:37.924 --> 37:40.927
I LOVE HIM

37:40.960 --> 37:43.263
SO INCREDIBLY MUCH.

37:43.296 --> 37:46.533
AND I TELL HIM
ALL THE TIME THAT--

37:46.566 --> 37:48.668
NO, HE REALLY
CHANGED EVERYTHING FOR ME--

37:48.702 --> 37:50.170
EVERYTHING ON EVERY LEVEL.

37:50.203 --> 37:52.205
AND WE HAVE MOUSEY AND FRITZY.

37:52.238 --> 37:54.974
- YEAH.
- AND YOU KNOW,

37:55.075 --> 37:56.409
I'M A GOOD NEGOTIATOR,
SO I THINK--

37:56.443 --> 37:58.211
- [laughs]

37:58.244 --> 38:01.214
- I THINK I CAN BEAT HIM DOWN
OVER TIME.

38:01.247 --> 38:02.816
I DON'T USUALLY GIVE UP.

38:02.849 --> 38:05.852
I MEAN, EVENTUALLY,
HE'LL MAYBE COME AROUND.

38:05.885 --> 38:09.022
YOU KNOW?
YEAH.

38:09.022 --> 38:10.056
- COMING UP...

38:10.090 --> 38:11.658
- LUISI.

38:11.691 --> 38:15.261
- YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH HER.
- NO, IT'S NOT HER, ACTUALLY.

38:15.295 --> 38:18.064
[sighs] MOTHER[bleep].
I'M SORRY.

38:23.937 --> 38:25.905
- WELCOME BACK.
I'M ANDY COHEN

38:25.939 --> 38:27.540
HERE WITH THE HOTTEST
REAL ESTATE BROKERS

38:27.574 --> 38:29.309
IN MANHATTAN.

38:29.342 --> 38:31.444
ALTHOUGH LUIS DOESN'T HAVE
SOMEONE SITTING NEXT TO HIM

38:31.478 --> 38:32.812
ON THE COUCH TONIGHT,

38:32.846 --> 38:35.415
WE DID GET TO MEET
A VERY SPECIAL LADY

38:35.448 --> 38:39.052
IN HIS LIFE ON THE TRIP
TO PUERTO RICO THIS SEASON.

38:39.052 --> 38:41.221
WATCH THIS.

38:41.254 --> 38:43.523
- LUISI.

38:43.556 --> 38:46.626
- OH, MY GOD!

38:46.659 --> 38:48.228
OH, FIORELLA.

38:48.261 --> 38:50.730
FIORELLA IS THE ONLY GIRLFRIEND
THAT I'VE EVER HAD.

38:50.764 --> 38:53.833
WHEN I MET HER,
EVERYTHING JUST STOPPED,

38:53.867 --> 38:55.101
AND I FELL IN LOVE.

38:55.135 --> 38:57.937
IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS,
AND I WANT HER TO KNOW

38:57.971 --> 38:59.506
HOW IMPORTANT
SHE WAS TO ME.

38:59.539 --> 39:01.207
SINCE I WAS WITH YOU,

39:01.241 --> 39:02.909
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY DATED
ANYBODY.

39:03.009 --> 39:05.078
EVER SINCE I BROKE UP
WITH FIORELLA,

39:05.111 --> 39:08.114
I'VE BEEN REFUSING
TO BE WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

39:08.148 --> 39:10.817
- [speaking Spanish]

39:10.850 --> 39:12.552
- [sighs] SORRY.

39:12.585 --> 39:14.421
I'M AFRAID OF BEING
IN ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP

39:14.454 --> 39:19.392
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID OF...

39:19.426 --> 39:21.394
COMING BACK TO THE POINT
THAT I WAS.

39:21.428 --> 39:24.431
I WANT YOU TO BE
A PART OF MY LIFE

39:24.464 --> 39:26.199
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

39:26.232 --> 39:30.403
I'M AFRAID OF LOSING MYSELF,
EXTREMELY.

39:32.305 --> 39:35.308
- YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH HER.
- NO, IT'S NOT HER, ACTUALLY.

39:35.342 --> 39:39.479
IT'S, UH...
[sighs]

39:39.512 --> 39:40.814
WHEN I FIRST MET THIS GIRL,

39:40.847 --> 39:42.515
I WAS THE MOST CONFIDENT PERSON
IN THE WORLD.

39:42.549 --> 39:44.818
NOTHING COULD DESTROY ME,
LIKE I SAID.

39:44.851 --> 39:47.887
AND WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW YOURSELF
REALLY,

39:47.921 --> 39:51.591
YOU COMPROMISE THINGS FOR THE
BETTER SAKE OF THE OTHER PERSON,

39:51.624 --> 39:53.259
AND SOMETIMES YOU BECOME
SOMEONE DIFFERENT.

39:53.293 --> 39:56.296
- YOU'RE AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA
LOSE PART OF YOURSELF?

39:56.329 --> 39:58.331
- BY CHANGING AGAIN, BY FINDING
SOMEONE THAT I NEED TO--

39:58.365 --> 40:00.300
THAT I FALL IN LOVE WITH
SO PASSIONATELY AND DEEPLY

40:00.333 --> 40:03.370
THAT I START CHANGING WHO I AM
IN ORDER TO MAKE HER HAPPY.

40:03.403 --> 40:06.072
AND THEN NOT--
AND THEN WHEN I'M DOWN,

40:06.106 --> 40:07.374
SHE STOPS ADMIRING
AND FALLING IN LOVE

40:07.407 --> 40:09.209
WITH THE PERSON I WAS
IN THE BEGINNING AND SHE LEAVES.

40:09.242 --> 40:11.911
AND THE REASON
I'M CRYING RIGHT NOW

40:11.945 --> 40:14.714
IS BECAUSE--

40:14.748 --> 40:17.217
LISTEN, YOU GUYS HAVE--
DEREK, YOU ARE AMAZING MAN.

40:17.250 --> 40:20.687
AND YOU, EMILIA,
ARE INCREDIBLE.

40:20.720 --> 40:24.090
AND I'M SO AFRAID
OF LOSING MYSELF AGAIN,

40:24.124 --> 40:25.558
THAT I'M MISSING OUT ON--

40:25.592 --> 40:29.629
ON HAVING SOMEONE WITH ME
ALONG MY JOURNEY.

40:29.662 --> 40:32.399
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH, ANDY.

40:32.432 --> 40:35.402
I'VE--
MOTHER[bleep].

40:35.435 --> 40:37.437
[crying]
I'M SORRY.

40:37.470 --> 40:39.239
[sighs]

40:40.907 --> 40:42.976
- NEXT WEEK IT'S PART TWO

40:43.009 --> 40:45.278
OF THE<i>MILLION DOLLAR LISTING</i>
<i>NEW YORK REUNION.</i>

40:45.311 --> 40:47.280
- I HAVE AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY,

40:47.313 --> 40:49.315
AND I HAVE NOBODY

40:49.349 --> 40:51.785
TO LIVE THAT JOURNEY WITH ME.

40:51.818 --> 40:53.186
- WILL WE ALL BE INVITED
TO YOUR WEDDING?

40:53.219 --> 40:54.521
- WE'LL SEE.
- THIS IS BIG.

40:54.554 --> 40:55.889
THIS IS BIG.

40:55.922 --> 40:57.390
- YOU TOOK IT
OUT OF MY POCKET.

40:57.424 --> 40:58.892
- IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.
RYAN, NO.

40:58.925 --> 41:00.360
- I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
SWALLOW YOUR TEETH.

41:00.393 --> 41:02.095
- LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.
WHERE IS YOUR INTEGRITY, MAN?

41:02.128 --> 41:03.096
- WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

41:03.129 --> 41:04.631
- I LOOK LIKE A FOOL

41:04.664 --> 41:06.066
BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO GET HELPED.

41:06.099 --> 41:07.934
- HAVE I EVER--
- YOU EVEN SAID, "I'M READY"--

41:07.967 --> 41:09.269
- EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE,
FREDRIK--

41:09.302 --> 41:10.270
EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE
I'VE EARNED IN THIS LIFE.

41:10.303 --> 41:12.072
WAKE THE [bleep] UP.

41:12.072 --> 41:15.642
- SO WHERE DO THE TWO OF YOU GO
FROM HERE?

41:15.675 --> 41:17.911
- I DON'T KNOW.
