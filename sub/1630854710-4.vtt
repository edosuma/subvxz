WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.720
In the world today, protecting
a country's borders is vital.

00:04.760 --> 00:06.720
(Siren wails)

00:06.760 --> 00:09.200
It is seen as a
gateway to the UK.

00:09.240 --> 00:12.880
These are the men
and women in uniform

00:12.920 --> 00:14.496
responsible for safeguarding
Ireland's borders -

00:14.520 --> 00:17.160
stopping... Look at me.
Behind the yellow line.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.576
..Searching... Have you been
stopped at a checkpoint before?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.496
Will you just listen to me?
Will you just listen to me?

00:21.520 --> 00:25.440
..And seizing drugs,
arms and illegal goods...

00:25.480 --> 00:28.520
If anyone tries to harm me,
that dog will tear them to shreds.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.960
..Saving lives... I'd
say about 200kph.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
..And protecting
Ireland's inhabitants

00:34.040 --> 00:36.040
and millions of
visiting tourists.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.256
You could have been here
100 times, it doesn't mean that

00:38.280 --> 00:40.600
you're guaranteed to
get in the 101st time.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.040
Good boy, Rex.
They police the ports...

00:43.080 --> 00:44.640
Well, you have to make sure

00:44.680 --> 00:46.880
there's definitely nobody
underneath the vehicle.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.320
..The airports...

00:48.360 --> 00:50.200
Why did you tell me
you weren't working?

00:50.240 --> 00:53.200
..And the roads. These are
very badly damaged straps.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.360
If you can't drive the truck,
shouldn't be on the road.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.680
These are the
border interceptors.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.320
Dublin airport's strict
immigration rules

01:09.360 --> 01:11.120
shock a traveller
from down under.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.640
How long are you staying?

01:13.680 --> 01:15.600
Keeping the border safe,

01:15.640 --> 01:19.480
it's a race through the streets
of Dublin to find a wanted car.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.960
And a young
passenger flying solo...

01:22.000 --> 01:23.960
Is this person collecting you?

01:24.000 --> 01:27.280
..Gives passport
control the run around.

01:33.520 --> 01:37.080
Passport and immigration officers
oversee all incoming passengers

01:37.120 --> 01:38.320
arriving at Dublin airport.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.200
Their role is to identify

01:42.240 --> 01:45.160
those intent on illegally crossing
the border into the country...

01:47.280 --> 01:50.560
And make sure all passengers
meet the strict entry requirements.

01:51.760 --> 01:55.320
At the non-eu passport desk,
detective garda ray flannery

01:55.360 --> 01:57.720
is getting ready to
check in new arrivals.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.000
Passing through
immigration checks

02:01.040 --> 02:05.800
can be a relatively straightforward
process if you have nothing to hide.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.200
Thank you.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.576
How long will you
stay? (Unclear)

02:08.600 --> 02:09.840
What do you do here?

02:09.880 --> 02:11.960
What date do you leave?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.480
Where's that?

02:13.520 --> 02:15.520
And initially how
long will you be here?

02:15.560 --> 02:18.240
How much money do you
have with you for your stay here?

02:18.280 --> 02:19.880
What will you be
doing with them?

02:19.920 --> 02:22.640
I'm not sure yet.
Partying is more like it.

02:22.680 --> 02:23.880
Alright. Thank you.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.840
How are you?

02:27.880 --> 02:29.120
How are you? Good.

02:29.160 --> 02:31.800
Well, tired. I know the feeling.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.920
This next passenger has
arrived from Australia unprepared.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.920
He steps up to
ray flannery's desk.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.240
How long are you staying?

02:42.280 --> 02:43.480
Why?

02:44.960 --> 02:46.600
And where you gonna
be for three months?

02:50.720 --> 02:52.240
Where in galway?

02:52.280 --> 02:53.840
Where in galway are you going?

02:56.680 --> 02:59.080
And how much money do you
have with you for your stay here?

03:02.640 --> 03:04.400
Sure. Do you have
a return ticket?

03:04.440 --> 03:06.320
Can I see it, please?

03:06.360 --> 03:10.640
The maximum we allow any non-eu
national to stay here is 90 days.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.960
In the UK, they give six months.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.800
The maximum we give
anybody here is 90 days.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.080
Nothing gets past
officer flannery.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.320
That's over 90 days, is it?

03:22.360 --> 03:24.000
It's over 90 days.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.760
Which is over 90 days. Ok.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.280
The Max I can
give you is 90 days.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.760
You leave early
anyway. Yeah, yeah. Ok.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.760
Yeah, 'cause the Max
you can get is 90 days.

03:49.640 --> 03:53.800
If they have a reason to extend
past that, and a valid reason,

03:53.840 --> 03:56.600
he would then go to the
local immigration officer

03:56.640 --> 03:59.400
and look for permission
to extend past 90 days.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.160
Ok. Thank you.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.000
It's been close
call, but it's cost him.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.160
He'll need to change
his return flights

04:08.200 --> 04:10.040
and leave earlier than planned.

04:13.880 --> 04:17.120
Dublin port is the perfect
entry point for criminals

04:17.160 --> 04:20.400
bringing contraband in
and out of the country.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.480
Patrolling the roads
around the port

04:23.520 --> 04:27.280
are garda traffic corps officers
paddy mcelroy and Phil Earl.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.840
Many of the garda's
vehicles are fitted with anpr -

04:31.880 --> 04:33.480
automatic number
plate recognition.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.280
Using onboard cameras,
this system is designed

04:38.320 --> 04:42.200
to detect, deter and disrupt
criminal activity on the roads.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.600
The officers turn the car
around and head to intercept.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.080
Very quickly they
locate the suspect's car

05:11.120 --> 05:13.400
parked up outside some shops.

05:16.800 --> 05:20.480
The officers retreat to a safe
distance and play the waiting game.

05:22.800 --> 05:28.000
In 2015, over 15,000 drug-related
offences were recorded in Ireland.

05:28.040 --> 05:33.680
14% of young adults under 34
admitted to having used cannabis,

05:33.720 --> 05:37.040
whilst nearly 5%
admitted to mdma,

05:37.080 --> 05:39.400
and 3% to having tried cocaine.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.800
The Irish heroin market alone

05:42.840 --> 05:44.200
is reported to be worth

05:44.240 --> 05:45.560
in the region of:

05:50.640 --> 05:52.200
Uh, he's on the move.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.160
The driver's on the move,

05:58.200 --> 06:00.800
and the garda traffic
corps are in pursuit,

06:00.840 --> 06:03.080
waiting for just the right
moment to corner him.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.040
(Unclear)

06:22.320 --> 06:25.080
Hold it. Show me your
hands. Show me your hands.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.280
Keep them up. Turn off the
engine, please. Thank you.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.120
How are you, sir?

06:30.160 --> 06:32.496
Patrick's my name. Garda here
attached to traffic Dublin castle.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.920
Yeah.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.920
Right, can you step out
of the car for a second?

06:37.400 --> 06:38.880
Ok, how are you?
This your vehicle?

06:40.320 --> 06:41.800
Do you mind us if
we have a search?

06:42.800 --> 06:45.080
No problem. You
agree to a search?

06:45.120 --> 06:48.440
No problem. Do you want to
empty everything out onto the bonnet

06:48.480 --> 06:50.800
that you have in your
pockets? You can do...

06:50.840 --> 06:53.680
No, no, no, no, empty everything...
Whatever you have in your pockets.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.520
Well, there's no
need to be scared.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.360
We're gonna do a
brief search of the car.

07:09.640 --> 07:10.840
Put your arms out.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.680
On this occasion,

07:15.720 --> 07:18.520
their meticulous search of the
driver and his car turns up nothing.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.840
Happy enough?

07:22.880 --> 07:24.520
You're free to go.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.320
Thanks for your cooperation.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.280
Very nice gentleman
to deal with.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.240
Nothing untoward
found in the vehicle

07:31.280 --> 07:33.280
so we let him on his way.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.600
The driver is free to go, but
with his registration logged

07:36.640 --> 07:40.200
in connection with
possible criminal activity,

07:40.240 --> 07:42.160
it may not be long

07:42.200 --> 07:45.680
before he is feeling the
long arm of the law again.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.840
Also patrolling the
streets around Dublin

07:50.880 --> 07:54.960
are garda traffic corps officers
Mark fay and Damien mcmairn.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.960
The garda traffic corps have
a fleet of over 2,500 vehicles

07:59.000 --> 08:01.320
and use a combination
of highly visible cars

08:01.360 --> 08:03.640
to act as a deterrent
on the roads,

08:03.680 --> 08:08.000
and unmarked vehicles for
surveillance and covert operations.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.960
Zero three delta seven
eight four five nine.

08:11.960 --> 08:15.760
The officers anpr system has
just got a hit on a car with no tax,

08:15.800 --> 08:18.640
and no national certificate
to prove its roadworthiness.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.120
Time to pull this driver over.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.880
How are you?

08:24.920 --> 08:27.416
Do you have your driving license
on you by any chance, do you?

08:27.440 --> 08:28.656
You've nothing on
you at the moment?

08:28.680 --> 08:30.440
Do you have any
form of identification

08:30.480 --> 08:32.160
just to show who you are?

08:32.200 --> 08:33.400
Nothing at all, no?

08:35.000 --> 08:38.200
Officer fay is able
to check her details

08:38.240 --> 08:41.280
against those showing on
the anpr and it doesn't match.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.760
She claims she has
just bought the car.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.600
Did you buy the car privately
or did you buy it off a garage?

09:03.320 --> 09:07.480
With the facts not adding up, officer
fay checks the car's insurance disc,

09:07.520 --> 09:09.360
and there's a problem there too.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.440
Cars in Ireland must,
by law, be insured

09:13.480 --> 09:15.720
and display an insurance
disc in their windscreen.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.920
It's estimated 150,000
road users in Ireland

09:20.960 --> 09:23.040
are driving without insurance.

09:24.080 --> 09:27.240
Whose insurance is displayed
at the front there, Jacqueline?

09:27.280 --> 09:29.280
Whose insurance is
that in the front then?

09:31.520 --> 09:33.280
Who are you insured with?

09:35.480 --> 09:37.000
Would you know
your policy number?

09:37.040 --> 09:38.600
No?

09:40.360 --> 09:42.600
The driver claims
that the car's insured,

09:42.640 --> 09:44.520
but as the policy
is not in her name,

09:44.560 --> 09:48.880
officer fay needs to make a call
to get to the bottom of the situation.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.080
Non-payment, alright.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.520
Alright, Jacqueline,
bit of bad news for you.

10:12.560 --> 10:17.120
The policy was cancelled as
of 26 April. You've no insurance.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.976
She's not been paying for her policy
and her insurance has been cancelled.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.160
At this moment in time,
like, you have no insurance.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.040
As it stands at the moment,
I can't let you drive on,

10:27.080 --> 10:28.480
like, you know what I mean?

10:28.520 --> 10:30.880
With no insurance, the garda
have to keep her off the road

10:30.920 --> 10:32.120
and so seize her car.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.360
I'm not victimising
you. I'm not.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.520
I actually have, like, no discretion
when it comes to insurance, like.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.720
(Unclear)

10:41.760 --> 10:43.296
No. The situation is I'm
impounding the vehicle

10:43.320 --> 10:45.696
under the provision of section
41 of the road travel act of 1961

10:45.720 --> 10:47.520
as amended. Alright, Jacqueline?

10:47.560 --> 10:48.880
(Unclear) ..Me bus fare home.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.160
Will you just listen to me?
Will you just listen to me?

10:52.160 --> 10:54.240
I just want to give
you a form as well.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.896
I want to give you a
form then, Jacqueline.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.560
It explains how to
get the vehicle back.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.360
But there's nothing she can do.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.120
Her car isn't going anywhere
soon. When it does move,

11:03.160 --> 11:05.296
it'll be on the back of a trailer,
heading for the city pound.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.400
..Keys and I'm just
gonna get you a form

11:07.440 --> 11:09.320
to explain how to
get your vehicle back.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.136
Protecting the borders from
those intent on breaking the law

11:15.160 --> 11:18.520
isn't the garda's only role.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.560
They also need to make sure

11:20.600 --> 11:24.160
all 30 million passengers that
pass through Dublin airport each year

11:24.200 --> 11:25.520
can do so safely.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.920
At the non-eu passenger desk,

11:29.960 --> 11:32.280
officer frank Flynn is
checking passports.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.920
Hello.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.880
How are you? Passport?

11:36.920 --> 11:40.240
A young girl arrives on
the next flight from Paris.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.520
As she's clearly
in the wrong Lane,

11:42.560 --> 11:45.120
he's alerted to the fact
that she's travelling alone.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.200
Have you got a boarding card?

11:47.240 --> 11:50.520
She came to the non-European
line, but that was a mistake on her part.

11:50.560 --> 11:51.960
Maybe she didn't know.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.096
She probably didn't realise,
just followed the crowd.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.920
You going to learn English?

11:55.960 --> 11:59.000
Industry experts believe more
and more children are flying solo

11:59.040 --> 12:01.760
with numbers now into the
hundreds of thousands each year

12:01.800 --> 12:03.400
and still climbing.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.160
Now, where are you
going to learn English?

12:06.240 --> 12:08.480
This also puts a strain
on ground teams too,

12:08.520 --> 12:10.040
with greater responsibility

12:10.080 --> 12:13.680
for the safety of the youngsters
travelling through the airport.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.880
Is this person collecting you?

12:16.920 --> 12:20.040
With the girl appearing to be
under 16 and in need of help,

12:20.080 --> 12:22.960
frank needs to make
sure she's in safe hands

12:23.000 --> 12:24.920
when she leaves the airport.

12:24.960 --> 12:29.560
Hello. This is immigration
in Dublin airport.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.240
Are you in the airport?

12:31.280 --> 12:33.200
Who are you expecting?

12:34.240 --> 12:36.640
He speaks to her
language school contact

12:36.680 --> 12:38.480
who gives him
some alarming news.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.520
Not with you, no?

12:41.560 --> 12:45.920
I rang the person and he said
she wasn't on his list of person.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.120
Thank you.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.600
It's ok? No, no, no.
I'll follow you out.

12:49.640 --> 12:53.080
Concern for the girl's
safety and with a duty of care,

12:53.120 --> 12:55.000
frank leaves his booth.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.120
He needs to find the school
contact that he was speaking to.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.680
Hello, Noel.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.320
Are you in terminal two?

13:04.360 --> 13:06.960
Sometimes people come
here unaccompanied

13:07.000 --> 13:10.400
and if something happens then
we've a duty of care, you know.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.240
We have to check the person out.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.480
Hiya, Noel. Hello
there. How are you?

13:16.520 --> 13:18.656
I just saw your name and
your phone number on it here.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.520
Yeah, no problem, yeah.

13:20.560 --> 13:24.280
But the contact appears to be
just as confused with the situation.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.120
Well, she's not on my list.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.160
She's not on your list?
But I'm going to check.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.696
I think she's... If
it can't be sorted,

13:29.720 --> 13:31.736
there's a very real chance
that she may be flying home.

13:31.760 --> 13:32.960
No, her...

13:34.960 --> 13:37.000
(Speaks foreign language)

13:37.040 --> 13:39.440
Is any named family there?

13:39.480 --> 13:41.520
I'll just get her now.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.840
Ok. He's going to find her now.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.080
(Unclear chatter)

13:47.440 --> 13:50.680
With the host family found,
frank checks their credentials.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.520
Lovely. That's great. I will,
my dear. Thanks very much.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.480
It's being worrying start
to this youngster's holiday,

13:58.520 --> 14:01.240
but thanks to frank's
tenacity, all has been resolved.

14:01.280 --> 14:05.080
Met her, met the lady
and everything was ok.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.640
So, it's fairly prevalent
in the summer holidays,

14:07.680 --> 14:09.920
people come to
learn English here,

14:09.960 --> 14:12.200
juveniles, unaccompanied
as well, you know.

14:12.240 --> 14:16.240
So, we've a duty of care,
so we have to make sure

14:16.280 --> 14:18.160
that they don't get lost.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.640
Outside Dublin,

14:20.680 --> 14:23.160
this car's number plate was
flagged as a vehicle of interest.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.040
Non payment, alright.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.920
The policy was
cancelled as of 26 April.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.880
At this moment in time, like,
you have no insurance, like.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.640
I'm not victimising you.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.800
The owner eventually admitted
to driving without insurance,

14:38.840 --> 14:40.320
and her car was seized.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.760
Back with officers
fay and mcmairn,

14:44.800 --> 14:47.280
the woman with no
insurance has had enough.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.920
She's heading home on foot.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.360
She's gone walking
on the motorway so...

15:00.640 --> 15:02.400
They need to stop her

15:02.440 --> 15:05.080
before she puts herself in
front of fast-moving traffic.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.720
Have a chat with her there.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.600
See if she can see
some bit of sense.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.320
Jacqueline, you can't go
walking on the motorway.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.040
You can't walk on a motorway.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.560
Is there anybody you can
contact? Anybody at all?

15:20.600 --> 15:23.200
You can't, Jacqueline, you
can't actually walk there on the...

15:23.240 --> 15:27.040
Jacqueline, Jacqueline, you can't
walk there onto the main roads.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.240
Jacqueline. I have to stop you.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.560
Can we bring her down
as far as the lodge there?

15:42.600 --> 15:43.960
The travel lodge?

15:44.000 --> 15:47.520
The officers have a duty of
care to keep her out of danger.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.680
They have to get
her off the road.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.160
But they're not taking her home,

15:53.200 --> 15:55.440
only to the next junction
where she'll be dropped off.

15:55.480 --> 15:59.280
That's as far as we can bring you.
We can't bring you to your house.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.760
But we're not a taxi
service either, Jacqueline.

16:07.320 --> 16:08.720
Yeah, why was it taken off you?

16:12.200 --> 16:15.040
Just getting you off the motorway,
Jacqueline. That's all we're doing.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.840
There's no begging.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.360
No, that's it. We're here.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.696
Look it, we're here. This is as
far as we're going, Jacqueline.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.200
(Unclear)

16:32.960 --> 16:36.400
Despite her pleas, the officers
leave the woman to her own devices.

16:38.440 --> 16:42.000
They then head back to her car to
oversee its removal to the pound.

16:48.280 --> 16:52.080
In 2017, nearly half of Ireland's
fatal road traffic accidents

16:52.120 --> 16:54.200
involved heavy goods vehicles,

16:54.240 --> 16:57.680
so making sure hgvs are
roadworthy is a vital job

16:57.720 --> 17:00.160
and roadside checks
are the perfect opportunity.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.960
Alright, Shane. Turn
it over the other way.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.880
It's the job of the road safety
authority working with the police

17:06.920 --> 17:09.920
to enforce the rules that keep
vehicles safe on Irish roads.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.376
You don't have the actual category
of license to pull a trailer at all

17:12.400 --> 17:13.400
according to this.

17:14.960 --> 17:18.640
Today's joint operation
between the rsa and the garda

17:18.680 --> 17:22.880
is situated near carlow on the
busy road leading from waterford port.

17:23.920 --> 17:27.040
Together they have the
authority to pull trucks off the road

17:27.080 --> 17:28.760
if they're deemed unsafe.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.760
If anything were to happen, it
wouldn't be good for anybody.

17:32.840 --> 17:37.160
Officer Liam lawler has pulled over
a vehicle he wants to inspect further.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.960
Do you see the way it's
tied on? Yeah, I do. Yeah.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.760
That particular strap
is very, very weak.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.680
It has been cut into the centre.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.760
Loose as well. You shouldn't
be able to move a strap like that.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.880
There's no protection
on the edge.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.720
There's no protection as it
goes around a bulge here,

17:56.760 --> 17:58.760
and it continues
where it shouldn't.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.760
These are very
badly damaged straps.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.760
As it travels to a
point down here

18:03.800 --> 18:08.600
where it's secured onto the
corner of a twist-lock handle.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.840
And if you look at here, I
can actually move it off...

18:11.840 --> 18:13.040
It's that loose.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.920
And that's what's
holding all that load,

18:15.960 --> 18:18.000
a strap that's as
loose that you can...

18:18.040 --> 18:21.360
It's literally going to fall
off down onto the roadway,

18:21.400 --> 18:23.360
and god knows what happens then.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.160
That's as bad as you get.

18:26.200 --> 18:29.240
It is definitely as
bad as you get.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.960
With the terrible
state of the straps,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.200
the truck is a
ticking time bomb.

18:33.240 --> 18:37.520
If one of these huge bags were to
break loose and fall into the road,

18:37.560 --> 18:39.280
the consequences
could prove fatal.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.280
There's at least a tonne
in each palette there,

18:42.320 --> 18:44.600
literally sitting
on a flatbed trailer

18:44.640 --> 18:47.680
with the grace of
god holding them on.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.400
Here, just right here.

18:49.440 --> 18:52.960
Ok. Why is there not one strap
going from there to the other side

18:53.000 --> 18:55.120
and that's it? Why does it go...

18:55.160 --> 18:57.600
Because when you wind
up the strap the far side,

18:57.640 --> 18:59.000
it's sticking the way out

18:59.040 --> 19:01.280
and there's more of a
possibility of it coming loose.

19:01.320 --> 19:04.040
The driver tries
to reason his case.

19:04.080 --> 19:07.080
He feels that he has
secured the load properly.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.800
But officer lawler
is having none of it.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.360
Yeah, no, you have
to do it properly.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.040
It has to be done properly.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.800
All of the straps that you have,
have some form of deformity.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.600
Right. What weight
is in each of those?

19:17.640 --> 19:18.960
You're two tonne a pallet.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.680
With an stf, or standard
tension force, of 250kg,

19:23.720 --> 19:26.440
he would need seven
straps to go across that,

19:26.480 --> 19:29.160
if he was to do it
theoretically right.

19:30.200 --> 19:34.120
He has one poor strap
across the same amount, like.

19:34.160 --> 19:37.200
He can't leave here
until that's properly done.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.600
That's an accident
waiting to happen.

19:39.640 --> 19:43.720
Unless the driver can locate more
straps and replace the faulty ones,

19:43.760 --> 19:45.400
his truck is going nowhere.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.960
There must be two straps at least
across each of those. Right, ok.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.680
To fill your obligations. Right.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.320
Alright. So, two - not those
straps. Two proper ones.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.480
Ok, and have you anybody
that can come with straps?

20:04.160 --> 20:05.360
Give him a ring.

20:06.520 --> 20:10.040
He has to get twice the number
of straps that he had already.

20:10.080 --> 20:12.240
He has made a
number of phone calls.

20:12.280 --> 20:15.440
Even though he's not from the
area, he's not allowed to continue

20:15.480 --> 20:17.600
until the straps have
been properly put on.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.200
He's in luck - the new straps
arrive with his colleague

20:28.240 --> 20:30.280
and the pair set about
resecuring the load.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.280
And officer lawler is much
happier with the new straps.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.720
Tells you the amount of force
you can put on the ratchet part

20:43.760 --> 20:45.320
which is 50 decanewtons.

20:45.360 --> 20:48.440
It tells you the tension that
you can get on the strap -

20:48.480 --> 20:50.520
the stretch factor, how
much it can stretch.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.600
Then it gives you the code for the
European standard for that strap.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.480
It's a good strap.
It's a good strap.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.200
Take her away, Vera.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.320
It's been rectified, but
it has taken some time.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.440
It would have been well worth
his while from the beginning

21:07.480 --> 21:10.560
to secure it properly, and
then he wouldn't have this delay.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.240
The safety aspect
here is the crucial factor.

21:13.280 --> 21:16.840
The trouble with that load
- 29 tonnes on a flatbed

21:16.880 --> 21:20.720
heading along the road, not
being held on properly at all...

21:20.760 --> 21:22.680
So, that tells its own story.
