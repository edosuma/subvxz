11:27.812 --> 11:31.482
Now, sweetie, I know you're still
adjusting to having a new sibling, okay?

11:31.565 --> 11:34.819
-But in time, you'll--
-Okay, bye, going to the graveyard!

11:34.902 --> 11:36.320
[sighs]

11:36.404 --> 11:38.364
-Will you please turn out normal?
-[giggles]

11:38.447 --> 11:40.449
[announcer] Ah-ooh!

11:40.533 --> 11:44.870
You rolled your joints.
Now get ready to roll with laughter.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.916
Please welcome our opening act
and our tour bus drivers,

11:48.999 --> 11:51.669
Bongwater and Spliff!

11:51.752 --> 11:52.628
[crowd cheering]

11:52.712 --> 11:55.506
It's great to be back
in the Cunt Cities, man.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.967
That's Quint Cities, man!

11:58.050 --> 12:00.344
I like cunt better, man!

12:00.428 --> 12:02.805
[crowd laughing]

12:02.888 --> 12:04.348
That's called "wordplay."

12:04.432 --> 12:07.977
I hate being a junior cop.
We can't even see the show.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.854
We are the show.

12:09.937 --> 12:15.109
Holy shit, it's that kid who narced on me
about a train crash I caused.

12:15.192 --> 12:20.030
I guess you narced so hard,
they gave you a baby uniform! [laughs]

12:20.114 --> 12:22.074
Seriously though, go fuck yourself.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.076
Uh, move it along, sir.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.828
Oh, fuck you!

12:25.911 --> 12:28.456
They made me paint fences
for community service.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.208
I had to learn the value
of a hard day's work because of you,

12:31.292 --> 12:33.586
you little red-haired piece of shit!

12:36.756 --> 12:41.177
Officer Glanney, this guy just shoved
a bag of weed down his jeans.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.930
-I don't have anything!
-I saw that hippie freak put it in there.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.057
That's good police work, Officer Billy.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.976
-I want to call my mom!
-Let's go, fuck-face.

12:49.059 --> 12:52.480
[all chanting]
Cavity search! Cavity search!

12:54.899 --> 12:58.778
Only 50 more spoonfuls,
and we're all done.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.905
We got to get some regular cutlery.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.198
Vic, I'm leaving.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.826
Thanks, but you don't have to go now.
The spoon store is probably closed.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.536
I'm leaving you for good.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.080
You wanted this, not me.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.208
I didn't ask to be a mom.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.043
I didn't even know I was pregnant

13:14.126 --> 13:16.212
until I lost all that weight
in the hospital.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.756
Sometimes things happen,
and you got to make the best of it.

13:18.839 --> 13:22.009
The Big Bopper didn't want to die
in a plane crash with Buddy Holly.

13:22.092 --> 13:24.136
But he did it,
and now he's super fucking famous.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.723
I need to be with someone
who only cares about me.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.894
Whoever this dude
you're leaving me for is,

13:31.977 --> 13:33.938
he's not half the man I am!

13:34.021 --> 13:35.397
Hello, Vic.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.941
[grunts]

13:37.024 --> 13:39.693
Aw, Skeeball, is this payback

13:39.777 --> 13:42.738
for the time I had relations
with your full-sized sister?

13:42.822 --> 13:43.781
[grunts]

13:43.864 --> 13:47.076
Me stealing your lady is not about you.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.953
[truck doors close]

13:52.706 --> 13:54.375
[Frank] Hey, Slick Vic!

13:54.458 --> 13:56.293
How's life treating you, amigo?

13:56.377 --> 13:58.295
Uh, to be honest, I'm kind of down.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.131
My woman just left me
for my shortest friend,

14:01.215 --> 14:03.968
and now I have to raise Vic Junior
by myself.

14:04.051 --> 14:06.136
It's tough being a single dad.

14:06.220 --> 14:09.056
I mean, chicks dig it, but I don't know
the first thing about how to--

14:09.139 --> 14:11.267
Yeah, life is pretty great, isn't it?

14:11.350 --> 14:14.144
I don't hate work,
the cops are fixing Bill for me.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.313
Christ, I haven't seen Kevin
in three days.

14:16.397 --> 14:19.859
It's like that feeling you get when you
have a penguin on your shirt. I just...

14:21.151 --> 14:22.278
Sixteen?

14:22.361 --> 14:25.030
Holy shit, that's box 16!

14:25.656 --> 14:27.157
The answer to my life!

14:27.241 --> 14:28.951
Frank Murphy's a winner!

14:29.702 --> 14:30.953
[humming]

14:31.036 --> 14:34.582
I wonder if I'll ever get excited
over finding a box of trash again.

14:36.959 --> 14:40.129
Okay, Dad,
what were you trying to tell me?

14:41.672 --> 14:42.840
What the hell is this?

14:43.382 --> 14:47.136
Well, Bobby, we're almost set
for the ABS Thanksgiving All-Star Special,

14:47.219 --> 14:50.431
featuring the return
of Buster Thunder Junior.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.392
All we're missing are the sweet potatoes.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.102
Bruce again!

14:55.185 --> 14:56.979
[all] Bruce again!

14:57.062 --> 15:00.941
I hate that guy.
He gives our community a bad name.

15:01.025 --> 15:04.820
He's not gay. He's married in real life
to that lady jai alai champion.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.156
Aren't you adorable.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.532
What do you want, Sue?

15:08.616 --> 15:11.327
Well, first of all, how about an apology

15:11.410 --> 15:13.621
for not letting me know
you moved back to town?

15:13.704 --> 15:15.164
I didn't think you'd care.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.458
You're my brother, and I love you!

15:17.541 --> 15:20.836
I call your house in Florida
to tell you you have a new niece,

15:20.920 --> 15:23.589
and that's how I find out
you've been here a year

15:23.672 --> 15:26.342
and opened a karate school
ten minutes from me?

15:26.425 --> 15:27.509
That really hurt.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.470
How would you want to find out?

15:29.553 --> 15:33.641
Should I have, I don't know,
blurted it out at a wedding?

15:33.724 --> 15:38.270
Believe me, I'll regret what I did to you
that day for the rest of my life.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.731
[sobs]

15:40.814 --> 15:44.234
Sue, I taught you the fake crying bit.
It doesn't work on me.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.780
I feel like hell, all right?
I'm a terrible sister.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.699
Ah, eating shit. Now that's catnip for me.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.327
Tell me more
about what a bad sister you are.

15:53.410 --> 15:57.081
I can't look at my wedding photos without
feeling ashamed of what I did to you.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.999
I'm really sorry.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.169
Oh, Sue.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.755
I don't want to hold onto this
anymore either.

16:04.838 --> 16:08.342
I miss you and the kids,
and it's been a while

16:08.425 --> 16:11.053
since I've had the chance
to make Frank feel uncomfortable.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.930
Would you like to come for Thanksgiving?

16:13.013 --> 16:15.557
It's a chance for Megan
to meet her favorite uncle.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.894
Okay, you win. Thanksgiving it is.

16:18.978 --> 16:23.649
[chuckles] And guess what?
I have great news. I talked to Dad, and--

16:23.732 --> 16:24.817
He's gonna be there?

16:24.900 --> 16:26.652
Yeah! I had to work on him, you know,

16:26.735 --> 16:30.823
but he's really warming up to the idea
of being in the same room with you again.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.533
Oh, lucky me.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.368
Fuck that old man!

16:34.451 --> 16:37.538
Oh, if you're into geezers, then you want
to go to The Wrinkled Twinkle

16:37.621 --> 16:39.415
on Industrial Highway.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.625
[Dr. Goldman] Yes, hi, it's Dr. Goldman.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.545
I pulled over and called
as soon as I got your page.

16:45.546 --> 16:48.966
Well, Goomer, it's natural
to envy your neighbor's life.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.553
It's your behavior around that issue
that concerns me.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.972
You didn't steal his clothes again,
did you?

16:55.597 --> 16:59.351
Mr. Mayor,
I... I believe you dropped this envelope,

16:59.435 --> 17:01.395
which is filled with nothing.

17:01.478 --> 17:05.315
Local 105 gets the asphalt pavers
on the tollway.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.109
Thank you, stranger.

17:08.318 --> 17:12.114
Y'all got any Italian food
that don't taste so fucking Italian?

17:12.197 --> 17:13.657
-[customers gasp]
-[glasses shatter]

17:14.950 --> 17:18.912
Y'all's mind if we roll dice
whiles we have a tap-dancing contest?

17:18.996 --> 17:20.956
[all gasp, exclaim]

17:21.540 --> 17:23.751
Mr. Mayor, what a pleasure.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.627
-Scooch over.
-Uh... Oh!

17:25.711 --> 17:26.920
[chuckles]

17:27.004 --> 17:28.714
I could get used to this.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.299
Get out of my restaurant.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.427
When you take your Mafia tollway
out of my neighborhood!

17:33.510 --> 17:34.595
[all gasp]

17:34.678 --> 17:37.014
I'll shove that road up your Black ass!

17:37.097 --> 17:38.474
[Rosie's friends] Damn!

17:38.557 --> 17:41.852
Is that any kind of language
to use in front of your wife?

17:41.935 --> 17:43.520
[all] Oh!

17:43.604 --> 17:45.064
This is my goomar!

17:45.147 --> 17:48.233
How dare you call my wife's sister
my wife?

17:48.317 --> 17:51.528
I will destroy you
and that jungle you live in!

17:51.612 --> 17:52.738
[Rosie's friends] Damn!

17:52.821 --> 17:55.240
Fuck you and your mother's mustache!

17:55.324 --> 17:56.366
[customers] Oh!

17:56.450 --> 17:57.493
[Rosie's friends] Damn!

17:57.576 --> 17:59.328
-[customers] Oh!
-[Rosie's friends] Damn!

18:00.037 --> 18:04.541
Hey, man, want to light me up?

18:04.625 --> 18:07.669
-[crowd cheering]
-Yeah, you're a hot chick, man!

18:07.753 --> 18:10.297
[crowd laughing]

18:10.380 --> 18:13.383
Their comedy is so layered.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.053
-Thank you, Rustvale. You've been great!
-[cheering]

18:16.136 --> 18:17.679
[girl] Alice!

18:17.763 --> 18:19.765
Hey, Rachel! Hannah!

18:20.849 --> 18:22.309
Hey, you got your braces off.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.853
Yeah, I'm going to town on corn now.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.356
I got them off
right after Camp Beth Shalom.

18:27.439 --> 18:31.193
Oh, yeah, Beth Shalom.
She was in my homeroom last year.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.277
[girls laugh]

18:32.361 --> 18:34.071
No, it's a Hebrew camp.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.198
Oh, we learned about those.

18:36.281 --> 18:40.828
Oh my God, it's so sad. I actually think
this old man on my street ran one of them.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.247
Guys, this is my boyfriend, Kevin.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.958
Oh, so you finally broke up with Joel.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.086
-What's a Joel?
-He's nobody. Just some boy I dated.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.921
Yeah, "dated."

18:51.004 --> 18:53.674
I remember when you two "dated"
on my mom's couch

18:53.757 --> 18:56.009
till your eyes rolled back in your head.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.970
[both laugh]

18:58.053 --> 19:00.889
That's so cool
how I didn't even know that.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.644
[Frank] No, I've been
through the whole box twice.

19:05.727 --> 19:08.522
-It doesn't make any sense.
-[Nora] That was your father.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.483
The only thing that made sense to me
is when he finally left.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.819
[Frank] Mom, maybe some of the old stuff
in this box rings a bell.

19:13.902 --> 19:17.406
Francis, why are you bothering me
with all this now?

19:17.489 --> 19:19.283
We talked three weeks ago.

19:19.366 --> 19:22.578
You told me your father was dead.
I danced a jig and went to bed.

19:22.661 --> 19:25.956
Mom, his dying words were "box 16," okay?

19:26.039 --> 19:27.916
I... I think maybe
there's something in here

19:28.000 --> 19:30.043
that can that can help me
finally close the chapter

19:30.127 --> 19:32.713
on the absolute fucking lunatic
that was my father.

19:32.796 --> 19:35.090
Fine, but make it quick.

19:35.174 --> 19:39.678
Okay. It's mostly just
old restaurant menus, soy sauce packets,

19:39.970 --> 19:43.015
an ashtray
from the Hotel Coral Springs in Sarasota.

19:43.098 --> 19:46.560
[Nora gasps] The ashtray from Sarasota?

19:46.643 --> 19:48.312
Yeah! Does that mean something?

19:48.395 --> 19:49.605
It means he's a thief!

19:49.688 --> 19:52.983
That was the only thing the cheap bastard
bought me on our honeymoon.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.485
I'm ashing into a coffee can
because of him.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.362
Mom, Mom, Mom, focus please.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.865
[sister] Who are you talking to?

19:59.948 --> 20:01.074
Your brother!

20:01.158 --> 20:03.702
Who died now?

20:03.785 --> 20:07.122
Nobody! He has the ashtray!

20:07.206 --> 20:10.000
[sister] Did you tell him
about the coffee can?

20:10.083 --> 20:13.253
[Nora] I did! He doesn't seem to care!

20:13.337 --> 20:15.047
-[sister] Of course he should care!
-[sighs]

20:15.130 --> 20:17.424
-Don't cry, buddy. Don't cry.
-[sister] You're his mother!

20:17.507 --> 20:19.676
[eerie music playing]

20:19.760 --> 20:22.971
[Maureen and Bridget]
Tortured spirits, angry souls.

20:23.055 --> 20:26.975
Dead shit-birds come out of your holes.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.937
I don't think your heart is in this.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.106
Do you even want to raise the dead
and laugh at how fucked-up they look?

20:33.190 --> 20:37.778
[sighs] I don't know.
This all feels kind of dumb right now.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.030
Jeez, who shoved a beaver up your dick?

20:40.113 --> 20:43.784
I'm sorry. It's just that
ever since the baby came along,

20:43.867 --> 20:46.245
I'm not my dad's princess anymore.

20:46.328 --> 20:49.790
Oh, that's easy to fix. We'll snatch her
and sell her at the gas station.

20:49.873 --> 20:52.501
Babies fetch a higher price
closer to the holidays,

20:52.584 --> 20:53.835
especially white ones.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.338
It's not her fault. She's just a baby.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.299
It's my dad. He doesn't care about me.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.677
All he can think about is her.

21:01.760 --> 21:06.390
Holy shit, it worked.
A dead guy's rising from his grave!

21:06.473 --> 21:08.016
Quit trying to cheer me up.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.810
No, for real! Look!

21:09.893 --> 21:11.728
[grunting]

21:11.812 --> 21:13.105
[both scream]

21:14.606 --> 21:16.650
Don't be afraid, little girls!

21:16.733 --> 21:19.194
I left my wristwatch in a corpse!

21:20.779 --> 21:26.201
Give it up for four ladies
who don't put the "sac" in "Sacramento,"

21:26.285 --> 21:28.662
which is where they're from. Fanny!

21:28.745 --> 21:29.955
[crowd cheering]

21:31.290 --> 21:33.792
Hello, Rustvale!
