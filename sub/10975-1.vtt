02:34.417 --> 02:39.923
Sebastian...
Let's try and focus.

02:40.089 --> 02:43.927
What can I say?
I'm a fool.

02:44.135 --> 02:50.767
- You're not a fool.
- I am, A poor little rich boy.

02:50.975 --> 02:55.855
It's not your fault.
Adolescence is a difficult time.

02:56.064 --> 02:59.734
Without great parenting,
things can go awry.

02:59.943 --> 03:05.698
But you have to rise above
their mistakes, Here.

03:08.910 --> 03:14.332
- An autographed copy, For me?
- It's yours.

03:15.208 --> 03:20.547
Stop being so hard on yourself.
What's in the past is over.

03:20.755 --> 03:22.924
You're right.

03:23.132 --> 03:28.805
It's hard to believe there was a
time when I only thought about sex.

03:29.013 --> 03:32.183
It's no way to go through life.

03:32.392 --> 03:35.562
Take yourself, for example.

03:35.728 --> 03:40.024
You're a very attractive woman.
You have killer legs.

03:40.191 --> 03:45.196
I'd love to photograph them...
That was the old me.

03:45.405 --> 03:52.120
I'm cured now.
Same time next week?

03:52.287 --> 03:56.332
I'm going on my book tour.
I'll be back in a month.

03:56.541 --> 04:00.336
- Why?
- Other people need my help, too.

04:00.545 --> 04:04.841
- You'll do just fine.
- I hope so.

04:05.008 --> 04:08.428
If you need anything, just call.

04:08.636 --> 04:12.098
I could use a hug.

04:19.939 --> 04:23.192
All right... There you go.

04:29.032 --> 04:32.952
- Your daughter on 1.
- Tell her to hold.

04:34.370 --> 04:41.169
- Is this her? She seems nice.
- She's great, Straight-A student.

04:41.377 --> 04:46.257
She's attending Princeton this fall.

04:46.466 --> 04:49.844
She's the type of girl
I should be with.

04:50.053 --> 04:53.681
She's a little out of your league.

04:55.183 --> 05:02.065
- Take care of yourself, Sebastian.
- Thank you... for everything.

05:03.858 --> 05:05.985
Shmuck.

05:12.200 --> 05:16.120
- Yes?
- Your daughter's still holding.

05:16.329 --> 05:21.834
- Hi, honey.
- You kept me on hold.

05:22.001 --> 05:27.256
He told me he loved me,
and I believed him.

05:27.465 --> 05:32.178
- I'm so stupid.
- It's all right.

05:32.386 --> 05:35.890
Take a deep breath,
step out of the circle.

05:36.099 --> 05:40.978
Cut the psycho-babble bullshit, Mom!

05:41.187 --> 05:44.357
There's pictures of me
on the lnternet.

05:44.524 --> 05:50.279
- What kind of pictures?
- Nudie pictures! What do you think?

05:52.490 --> 05:58.621
- How could you be so stupid?
- He was just so charming.

05:58.830 --> 06:02.291
He said I had killer legs, -

06:02.500 --> 06:05.253
- and he wanted to photograph them.

06:05.461 --> 06:10.341
Things just got
completely out of hand.

06:12.134 --> 06:14.971
Mom... Are you there?

06:15.763 --> 06:19.100
Mom? Mother!

06:23.896 --> 06:26.357
Sebastian!

06:27.525 --> 06:31.070
You're going to pay for this,
you little shit!

06:31.279 --> 06:37.577
- You sicko! Pervert!
- What's her problem?

06:37.785 --> 06:41.455
Someone's in need of therapy.

06:41.664 --> 06:45.418
You won't get away with this.
Get away!

06:46.711 --> 06:50.590
- What's your name?
- Clorissa.

06:50.798 --> 06:55.094
- Clorissa? God, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

06:55.303 --> 06:58.931
- I'm going to take you to lunch.
- Okay.

07:21.954 --> 07:24.957
There's no parking here, sir.

07:36.802 --> 07:41.849
We're so happy that Cecile will be
attending Manchester with you.

07:42.058 --> 07:45.227
You've been an inspiration to us.

07:45.394 --> 07:49.690
We hope she can rise to the
high standards you've set for her.

07:49.857 --> 07:52.943
I'll do my best.

07:53.986 --> 07:59.033
- What was that?
- "Thanks," Isn't Vietnamese lovely?

08:01.202 --> 08:07.375
Kathryn is very popular at school.
Listen to whatever she has to say and you'll go far.

08:07.583 --> 08:12.922
- Where do you get your strength?
- It sounds corny, but...

08:13.089 --> 08:20.679
When I'm tempted by peer pressure,
I turn to God, He helps me.

08:20.888 --> 08:26.477
- That's beautiful.
- What are the boys like?

08:26.644 --> 08:31.690
Cecile...
Is that all you can think of?

08:33.067 --> 08:38.905
Forgive her, She's never been in
a co-educational atmosphere before.

08:39.115 --> 08:45.037
It's understandable, Most boys
at Manchester are very upstanding.

08:45.246 --> 08:48.999
But there are a few bad apples.

08:49.208 --> 08:55.131
Like your stepbrother Sebastian.
What he did to the school nurse...

08:55.339 --> 08:58.926
I hear she's recovering quite well.

08:59.135 --> 09:03.264
Nice to see you again, Mrs Caldwell.

09:03.430 --> 09:09.937
- You remember my daughter Cecile?
- My, what an adorable shirt.

09:10.146 --> 09:13.399
My father took me to Australia.

09:13.607 --> 09:18.237
How are things down under?
Blossoming, I hope.

09:18.445 --> 09:21.365
What?

09:22.783 --> 09:26.996
- I'm so sorry...
- Well, thank you for your help.

09:27.204 --> 09:31.917
- I'll call about your curriculum.
- Okay, thanks.

09:32.126 --> 09:34.962
It was nice meeting you.

09:35.921 --> 09:41.135
Let's go, Keep your legs together.
This isn't Jamaica.

09:44.013 --> 09:47.349
I didn't know it was Asshole Day.

09:47.516 --> 09:52.396
I'm just taking the poor girl
under my wing.

09:54.023 --> 09:56.525
The parental units called.

09:56.734 --> 09:59.737
How's your whore of a mother
enjoying Bali?

09:59.904 --> 10:05.743
She suspects that your impotent,
alcoholic father is diddling the maid.

10:07.494 --> 10:12.041
- Therapy not going well?
- It was fine.

10:14.001 --> 10:18.047
Clorissa, "Call me,"

10:18.213 --> 10:23.552
I'm sick of sleeping with these
insipid Manhattan debutantes.

10:23.719 --> 10:30.100
- Nothing shocks them anymore.
- Relax, I have a mission for you.

10:30.309 --> 10:37.358
- Remember Court Reynolds?
- The Nazi who dumped you July 4th?

10:37.566 --> 10:44.114
I went to great lengths to please
Court, I made huge sacrifices.

10:44.323 --> 10:49.745
My feelings were hurt when I learned
Court had fallen for someone else.

10:49.912 --> 10:54.041
- You don't mean,.?
- None other than Cecile Caldwell.

10:54.208 --> 10:57.461
So that's what this is all about.

10:57.628 --> 11:00.297
"Keep your enemies close,"

11:00.464 --> 11:05.260
When I'm done with Cecile, she'll
be the premier tramp of New York.

11:05.469 --> 11:08.222
Court's princess
will be damaged goods.

11:08.430 --> 11:16.313
- Why not just attack Court?
- That could be traced back to me.

11:16.522 --> 11:21.693
That won't do, Everyone loves me,
and I intend to keep it that way.

11:21.902 --> 11:26.115
I see your point.

11:27.825 --> 11:33.831
- Why should I care?
- You have to seduce young Cecile.

11:35.374 --> 11:38.377
She's quite cute, you know.

11:38.585 --> 11:42.005
Young, supple breasts.

11:42.214 --> 11:45.884
A tight, firm ass.

11:48.804 --> 11:51.890
Uncharted booty.

11:54.893 --> 12:00.566
Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.
Boldly go...

12:01.942 --> 12:05.362
where no man has gone before.

12:06.655 --> 12:09.408
I can't.

12:09.575 --> 12:14.037
- Why not?
- Come on, Kathryn, It's too easy.

12:14.246 --> 12:18.917
Get one of your moron friends to
do it, I've a reputation to uphold.

12:19.126 --> 12:23.422
- Diddling the therapist's daughter?
- She was overcharging.

12:25.340 --> 12:29.303
This is a challenge.

12:30.721 --> 12:35.726
- I know all about menstrual cramps.
- Shut up and turn to page 64.

12:43.859 --> 12:47.988
"Why I plan to wait",
by Annette Hargrove, Kansas City.

12:51.116 --> 12:55.913
- Jesus Christ, is she for real?
- She's Daddy's little angel.

12:56.121 --> 12:58.665
A paradigm of chastity.

13:00.584 --> 13:05.130
Let's see.
Boring, boring, boring...

13:05.339 --> 13:08.717
"I love my parents,"

13:08.926 --> 13:13.055
"Making a mature decision..."
Here!

13:13.263 --> 13:16.600
She has a boyfriend named Trevor.

13:16.767 --> 13:21.146
Going out for a year.
Trevor understands.

13:21.355 --> 13:25.150
Trevor's a fag.
Too bad she lives in Kansas.

13:25.359 --> 13:31.281
Au contraire, The virgin's father
is the new headmaster at our school.

13:31.490 --> 13:35.243
She's staying with my aunt
while her parents sell the house.

13:36.411 --> 13:40.374
Can you imagine what this will do
for my reputation?

13:40.582 --> 13:44.795
Screwing the new headmaster's
daughter before school starts.

13:45.003 --> 13:51.968
- She'll be my greatest victory.
- You don't stand a chance.

13:54.513 --> 14:00.018
- Care to make a wager?
- I'll think about it.

14:00.185 --> 14:05.315
Duty calls, Dr Greenbaum and her
daughter will be an exciting entry.

14:05.524 --> 14:08.944
Your journal...
Could you be more queer?

14:09.152 --> 14:13.532
Could you be more desperate
to read it?

14:21.206 --> 14:24.459
Sebastian...

14:24.668 --> 14:28.797
Could you come here for a second?

14:38.056 --> 14:42.602
About that little wager of yours...
Count me in.

14:43.979 --> 14:47.566
What are the terms?

14:47.774 --> 14:50.360
If I win...

14:50.569 --> 14:56.324
- Your hot little car is mine.
- And if I win?

14:56.491 --> 15:02.706
You'll get something you've wanted
since our parents got married.

15:02.914 --> 15:06.960
Be more specific.

15:07.127 --> 15:11.965
In English...
I'll fuck your brains out.

15:14.176 --> 15:19.264
What makes you think I'll go for it?
That's a 1956 Jaguar Roadster.

15:22.517 --> 15:26.480
Because I'm the only person
you can't have, and it kills you.

15:28.648 --> 15:31.193
No way.

15:31.401 --> 15:34.571
You can put it anywhere.

15:39.576 --> 15:44.289
You got yourself a bet, baby.

15:48.043 --> 15:51.755
Happy hunting, Sebastian.

16:05.685 --> 16:09.356
Your home is beautiful,
Mrs Rosemond.

16:09.564 --> 16:13.026
It's been in my family
for over 100 years.

16:13.235 --> 16:19.157
- Does your family ride much?
- My grandpa used to break horses.

16:19.366 --> 16:22.285
- What was that?
- Sebastian must be home.

16:22.452 --> 16:25.538
Pull!

16:27.749 --> 16:32.545
- Sebastian!
- Fuck me...

16:32.754 --> 16:36.800
Aunt Helen!
God, I've missed you!

16:37.008 --> 16:40.845
I've been looking all over for you.

16:41.054 --> 16:46.184
I want you to meet Annette.
Annette Hargrove, this is Sebastian.

16:46.393 --> 16:51.523
- She'll be staying for a few weeks.
- I guess that makes two of us.

16:51.731 --> 16:54.317
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

16:54.526 --> 17:00.448
Aunt Helen, why don't you whip up
some of that ice tea of yours?

17:00.657 --> 17:04.786
- Don't get into any trouble.
- We won't.

17:05.787 --> 17:09.040
Come on.

17:10.165 --> 17:14.003
Quickly, lots to see.

17:19.259 --> 17:26.473
I read your manifesto, I must say,
I found it rather appalling.

17:27.767 --> 17:32.605
- Most people praise me for it.
- Most people are sheep.

17:32.814 --> 17:35.900
You criticise something
you've never experienced.

17:36.067 --> 17:42.198
I just believe people shouldn't
make love before they are in love.

17:42.407 --> 17:46.286
People our age aren't mature enough
to know those emotions.

17:46.494 --> 17:50.707
- Are you a lesbian?
- No.

17:50.874 --> 17:54.794
I just picked up on
a little of that lesbian vibe.

17:55.003 --> 17:58.715
I wouldn't expect you
to understand my beliefs.

17:58.923 --> 18:05.346
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I know of your reputation.

18:05.555 --> 18:07.599
What have you heard?

18:07.807 --> 18:12.353
That you promise girls the world
to get them in bed with you.

18:12.520 --> 18:16.149
- Who told you this?
- A friend wrote me.

18:16.357 --> 18:20.737
- That's a little tacky.
- It's the truth, isn't it?

18:20.945 --> 18:24.908
If you say so.

18:30.038 --> 18:34.417
That's good.
Let's try the G-major scale.

18:38.046 --> 18:42.342
Once again.
Remember, the third note is sharp.

18:43.343 --> 18:46.262
I suck!

18:46.471 --> 18:50.350
Relax, Take a deep breath.

18:50.558 --> 18:55.772
You're concentrating too much
on your bowing, Let me help you.

18:55.980 --> 18:59.234
Close your eyes.

19:19.963 --> 19:25.885
Mai-lee, be careful!
We've had this discussion.

19:26.052 --> 19:30.848
I didn't mean to interrupt.
Your playing was beautiful.

19:31.057 --> 19:34.978
This is Ronald Clifford.
He'll be teaching me this summer.

19:35.186 --> 19:38.982
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

19:39.190 --> 19:43.236
Ronald is attending pre-Juilliard.
He's composing his first opera.

19:43.403 --> 19:49.784
- It's based on Martin Luther King.
- Dr King is my favourite.

19:51.828 --> 19:56.833
I guess our hour's up.
Same time tomorrow?

20:03.923 --> 20:06.926
Bye.

20:11.055 --> 20:14.392
Unbelievable.
Some fag, no offence, -

20:14.559 --> 20:19.105
- wrote a letter to this chick
describing my tactics.

20:19.313 --> 20:24.736
- Any idea who it could be?
- If I did, the person would suffer.

20:25.987 --> 20:32.952
- Where is the little girl from?
- Kansas, Who do I know in Kansas?

20:33.161 --> 20:36.622
- Greg McConnell.
- The football stud?

20:36.831 --> 20:41.127
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was your rat.

20:41.294 --> 20:47.300
He hates me, I fingered his
girlfriend at Homecoming last year.

20:47.508 --> 20:52.430
- I don't think that bothered him.
- What do you mean?

20:53.848 --> 21:00.396
Greg likes to tackle tight ends
on and off the field.

21:00.605 --> 21:04.650
- You're shitting me.
- I shit you not.

21:04.817 --> 21:08.154
He used to sneak into my dorm drunk.

21:08.362 --> 21:11.866
As soon as he'd come
he'd freak out:

21:12.074 --> 21:17.830
"What are you doing? I'm not a fag.
If you tell, I'll kick your ass!"

21:17.997 --> 21:24.796
I only put up with it because
the man has a mouth like a Hoover.

21:25.004 --> 21:30.760
- Too bad he's in Kansas.
- Not anymore.

21:30.927 --> 21:34.639
The football team started practice
last week.

21:34.847 --> 21:38.893
- We've already had a session.
- Good for you.

21:39.894 --> 21:44.690
Could you arrange a get-together
with him tonight?

21:47.318 --> 21:50.655
"Spartacus" is on TV tonight.

21:50.821 --> 21:55.284
- Outstanding.
- But it'll cost you.

21:55.451 --> 21:59.413
Just make sure
your front door is unlocked.

21:59.622 --> 22:03.668
Shall we say the stroke of midnight,
no pun intended?

22:03.834 --> 22:08.589
The stroke of midnight it is.

22:10.216 --> 22:15.805
I take out my dick
and I shove it right in her face.

22:16.013 --> 22:19.684
I'm like, "Suck it, you dumb bitch,"

22:19.892 --> 22:24.605
- The Gregster.
- Yes, the Gregster.

22:27.316 --> 22:32.530
- Gregory?
- Hi, Blaine.

22:32.738 --> 22:38.244
I hear you went on a date with
Court Reynolds, I hear he's nice.

22:38.452 --> 22:45.501
He kept talking about this bulimic
headcase he dumped on July 4th.

22:45.710 --> 22:51.215
- Bulimic headcase?
- What a loser she must be.

22:51.882 --> 22:54.135
Sorry.

22:54.343 --> 23:00.016
Court's invited me to the Hamptons
for Labour Day weekend.

23:00.224 --> 23:03.394
- That's great.
- You think so?

23:03.602 --> 23:08.399
- I guess I'm just scared.
- Of what?

23:08.607 --> 23:12.445
Boys, I've never even got
to first base with a guy.

23:12.653 --> 23:16.532
Haven't you practiced
on a girlfriend?

23:16.741 --> 23:22.747
- No, that's gross.
- How do you think girls learn?

23:24.999 --> 23:29.128
Close your eyes and wet your lips.

23:29.295 --> 23:33.215
- Are you for real?
- Do you want to learn?

23:33.424 --> 23:36.177
I guess.

23:46.103 --> 23:49.690
- That wasn't so scary.
- It was nothing.

23:49.899 --> 23:56.238
Let's try it again, This time I'll
stick my tongue in your mouth.

23:56.447 --> 24:03.162
Massage my tongue with yours.
That's what first base is.

24:03.913 --> 24:08.459
- Okay.
- Eyes closed.

24:31.941 --> 24:36.654
- Not bad.
- That was cool.

24:38.447 --> 24:43.077
Maybe you should try it
on your friend Ronald sometime.

24:43.953 --> 24:49.291
- What are you saying?
- It's obvious he's crazy about you.

24:50.626 --> 24:53.963
He sends me love letters.

24:54.171 --> 24:58.843
- How romantic, Have you responded?
- No.

24:59.051 --> 25:05.266
- Don't you like him?
- I think about him all the time.

25:05.474 --> 25:08.936
If my mom found out she'd kill me.

25:09.144 --> 25:15.150
- You did hide the letters, right?
- In an antique doll's house.

25:15.317 --> 25:20.823
- Bring me copies of the letters.
- Why?

25:20.990 --> 25:24.076
I'm great at love letters.

25:24.285 --> 25:27.830
I'll have him eating
out of the palm of your hand.

25:28.038 --> 25:32.960
- Maybe you can meet at my house.
- You'd do that for me?

25:33.168 --> 25:37.965
- Of course, We're friends, right?
- Best friends.

25:39.550 --> 25:42.720
Do you want to have a sleepover?

26:00.529 --> 26:03.532
Hello?

26:04.283 --> 26:06.869
Excuse me...

26:10.664 --> 26:17.296
- Excuse me ...
- What a pleasant surprise.

26:19.715 --> 26:24.178
- The music's playing in every room.
- It's not, just yours.

26:26.013 --> 26:28.766
I thought you'd be pleased.

26:36.815 --> 26:40.402
- What are you doing in your room?
- Reading.

26:40.611 --> 26:45.657
- Anything interesting?
- Yes, it's quite intriguing.

26:47.117 --> 26:50.788
For you.

26:50.996 --> 26:55.918
Something to start
the new school year with.

26:58.629 --> 27:02.841
- You didn't have to do this.
- You hate it.

27:04.885 --> 27:10.474
- You just didn't have to do it.
- Can you join me for a swim?

27:10.641 --> 27:15.479
It is ten o'clock,
but we are reasonably young.

27:15.687 --> 27:20.818
Your proposal's only mildly
insulting, so I'll consider it.

27:22.569 --> 27:25.739
Give me a minute.

27:32.454 --> 27:35.457
- Fuck her yet?
- I'm working on it.

27:35.666 --> 27:38.752
Call me later.

28:01.233 --> 28:04.611
Sebastian?

28:15.163 --> 28:20.419
Would you mind turning around
so I can put on my bathing suit?

28:20.627 --> 28:23.881
This is so embarrassing...

28:27.968 --> 28:32.514
It amazes me someone as charming
as you can be so manipulative.

28:32.723 --> 28:35.809
You're not going to start again?

28:35.976 --> 28:39.730
What was my favourite part,.?

28:39.938 --> 28:47.154
"He has never uttered a single word
without some dishonourable intent,"

28:47.321 --> 28:53.452
"Every woman he has pursued has
regretted it, Stay away from him,"

28:53.660 --> 29:00.959
You could at least have the decency
to tell me who's bad-mouthing me.

29:01.126 --> 29:04.463
Not a chance.

29:09.134 --> 29:15.432
You're right...
about what you said today.

29:15.641 --> 29:19.061
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

29:19.269 --> 29:22.814
- I'm not giving you a hard time.
- It's okay.

29:23.023 --> 29:28.945
Look at you,
with all your morals and values...

29:29.112 --> 29:37.287
You seem to be happy in your
choices, I envy you, No bullshit.

29:37.454 --> 29:43.126
Seriously.
You've got everything going for you.

29:43.335 --> 29:48.507
You're smart,
you're beautiful, you're determined.

29:48.715 --> 29:52.219
You're everything I want
in a girlfriend.

29:53.762 --> 29:56.598
You know I'm seeing someone?

29:56.765 --> 30:03.480
Yes, the infamous Trevor, It's funny
how you haven't mentioned him.

30:03.647 --> 30:06.733
He's backpacking through Europe.

30:06.900 --> 30:11.279
He's great, I really miss him.

30:11.488 --> 30:16.910
- I care.
- I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

30:17.119 --> 30:19.162
Honestly?

30:19.371 --> 30:24.793
"You're smart,
you're beautiful... determined,"

30:25.001 --> 30:27.838
That won't get you anywhere.

30:28.004 --> 30:34.469
The best you can hope for
is my friendship.

30:40.809 --> 30:43.895
Good night, sweet pea.

31:04.583 --> 31:08.336
- Oh, baby...
- "Baby"?

31:11.715 --> 31:14.384
Right on time.

31:14.551 --> 31:21.266
- Shit! Give me my underwear.
- Don't get so huffy.

31:24.227 --> 31:27.939
What do we have here?

31:28.148 --> 31:32.986
Look, Valmont, it's the first time
I've ever done anything like this.

31:33.194 --> 31:37.741
- I was just...
- Really drunk and blah-blah-blah.

31:37.949 --> 31:42.621
Please don't tell anyone.
This could ruin my whole career.

31:42.829 --> 31:46.333
Your career?
Greg, what about your family?

31:47.626 --> 31:52.964
Wouldn't your dad be humiliated to
find out his son's a fudge-packer?

31:55.675 --> 32:00.597
I'll do anything, Let's just
forget about this whole thing, okay?

32:04.017 --> 32:11.483
No, I can't help you there, You're
bad-mouthing me to Annette Hargrove.

32:11.691 --> 32:14.444
What are you talking about?

32:15.570 --> 32:18.907
You're the only one who knows her.

32:19.115 --> 32:22.869
I never said a word to her
about you.

32:23.078 --> 32:26.581
He's probably telling you the truth.

32:26.790 --> 32:31.628
The man can barely write out
a grocery list, let alone a letter.

32:35.048 --> 32:38.760
All right... I believe you.

32:39.803 --> 32:43.473
Your secret's safe with me.

32:43.682 --> 32:48.436
Actually, there is something
you can do for me.

32:49.646 --> 32:54.693
- What else do you know about him?
- Well, he's smart as hell.

32:54.901 --> 33:01.241
He's dedicated to achieving his
goals, He always gives 110 percent.

33:02.283 --> 33:05.954
He's always watched my back.

33:06.162 --> 33:10.375
He's got a bad rep,
but it's mostly bullshit.

33:10.542 --> 33:13.962
I've heard awful things about him.

33:14.170 --> 33:19.676
- From who?
- I'm sworn to secrecy.

33:19.843 --> 33:25.515
- How long have we known each other?
- Forever.

33:25.682 --> 33:30.562
It's my job to look out for you.
You're like a sister to me.

33:30.770 --> 33:36.109
Do I look like a gossip queen?
It's me, Greg.

33:36.276 --> 33:40.488
The Gregster.
I'm serious.

33:41.448 --> 33:48.079
- You swear not to tell anybody?
- I swear on my momma's life.

33:49.247 --> 33:52.250
That nosy bitch, Are you sure?

33:52.458 --> 33:57.797
She said "Mrs Caldwell".
They met at orientation.

33:57.964 --> 34:02.594
- Did you do what I asked you to?
- Yeah.

34:02.760 --> 34:05.346
- She bought it?
- I'm pretty sure.

34:05.555 --> 34:09.266
- Pretty sure, or sure-sure?
- She bought it.

34:12.603 --> 34:15.690
She tried to outdo me, -

34:15.899 --> 34:21.905
- even though I told her
that I could do this.

34:22.071 --> 34:26.367
My best friends Sue, Kelly
and Frances knew I could do it.

34:27.202 --> 34:30.121
- You okay?
- Yeah.

34:30.330 --> 34:33.875
You would not believe...

34:38.213 --> 34:41.591
- It's my mom.
- I should get going.

34:41.799 --> 34:45.344
- See you tomorrow?
- Absolutely.

34:48.556 --> 34:52.310
- Goodbye.
- Peace out.

34:53.311 --> 34:57.523
"Peace out"? Moron.

35:00.068 --> 35:04.030
- Okay, what's wrong with you?
- Are you ready for this?

35:05.573 --> 35:12.080
I've discovered that Mrs Caldwell
urged Annette to stay away from me.

35:12.288 --> 35:15.124
- Interesting.
- Yes, it is.

35:15.333 --> 35:20.254
I now plan to devote all my energy
to destroying the douchebag.

35:20.463 --> 35:26.052
The plot thickens, Cecile
has fallen for her music teacher.

35:26.219 --> 35:28.888
Mrs Caldwell will love that.

35:29.055 --> 35:33.976
But Don Juan moves with the speed
of a Special Olympic hurdler.

35:34.185 --> 35:37.355
What's your plan of attack?

35:37.563 --> 35:43.319
I rat Cecile out to Mommy, who goes
ballistic and ends the relationship.

35:44.612 --> 35:47.949
But who will they turn to for help?

35:51.285 --> 35:57.834
Cecile is going away with Court
next week.

35:58.042 --> 36:02.338
I need you to speed up
her sexual awakening.

36:02.505 --> 36:06.551
- I'm at your service.
- Thank you.

36:11.431 --> 36:18.229
- That feels good.
- Sis, you're so tense.

36:18.438 --> 36:21.107
I know...

36:21.274 --> 36:26.070
I hate it
when things don't go my way.

36:26.279 --> 36:30.741
It makes me so horny.

36:30.908 --> 36:34.328
I hate it, too.

36:40.543 --> 36:45.965
It seems like things
are looking up for you.

36:46.674 --> 36:50.553
It appears so.

36:54.599 --> 37:02.273
- Any luck with your girl?
- Moving along quite well.

37:04.525 --> 37:11.574
- Have you succeeded in your task?
- Any day now.

37:15.703 --> 37:22.126
Well, let me know when you do.
Until then...

37:27.965 --> 37:30.801
Down, boy!

37:34.013 --> 37:37.016
Come on!

37:49.153 --> 37:52.782
Hi, it's Sebastian.
I didn't wake you, did I?

37:52.990 --> 37:55.576
No, not at all.

37:55.785 --> 38:02.416
- Did I leave my glasses there?
- No, I don't think so.

38:03.542 --> 38:07.046
All right.
I guess I'll see you around.

38:09.340 --> 38:14.345
- Is that really why you called?
- No.

38:14.553 --> 38:19.016
- I miss talking to you.
- A moment of honesty.

38:19.183 --> 38:24.230
- Well, I'm not liking it too much.
- What are you doing tomorrow?

38:24.438 --> 38:27.441
I'm going out with you.

38:42.790 --> 38:48.379
I came as quick as I could.
What's wrong?

38:49.380 --> 38:52.049
It's Cecile.

38:52.216 --> 38:58.931
- You promise not to say anything?
- Yes, It isn't drugs, is it?

38:59.724 --> 39:02.727
It's worse.

39:08.858 --> 39:13.404
I think there's something between
Cecile and her music teacher.

39:14.363 --> 39:19.243
- Ronald? That's crazy.
- Yes, she's so young, he's so...

39:19.452 --> 39:23.914
Black!
Brown sugar... no sugar.

39:24.790 --> 39:28.711
He's sent her love letters,
they're under her doll's house.

39:28.919 --> 39:34.341
Something like this could destroy
her reputation at Manchester.

39:36.343 --> 39:41.140
I hope I was right to tell you, I'd
hate to see her ruin it with Court.

39:42.057 --> 39:46.687
- I can't thank you enough.
- You will be discreet?

39:46.896 --> 39:50.691
Absolutely.

39:58.199 --> 40:02.328
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Excuse me?

40:03.120 --> 40:06.957
I'm not paying you
to pervert my child.

40:07.166 --> 40:11.212
I think you're
misunderstanding something.

40:11.420 --> 40:14.673
Care to explain this, then?

40:17.343 --> 40:21.889
- Where did you find those?
- Margarita did, when cleaning.

40:22.056 --> 40:25.768
Go to your room... Now!

40:29.647 --> 40:35.152
How dare you disrespect me?
I got you off the streets.

40:35.319 --> 40:38.697
The streets?
I live at 59th and Park.

40:38.906 --> 40:43.285
Whatever, You are never to set foot
in this house again, -

40:43.494 --> 40:48.582
- and you are never to see
my daughter again, Understood?

40:48.791 --> 40:52.253
First of all,
I never touched your daughter.

40:52.461 --> 40:57.549
Second, I'd like to think
you could look beyond racial lines.

40:57.758 --> 41:02.763
Don't give me that racist crap.
We gave money to Colin Powell.

41:03.973 --> 41:10.312
I guess that puts me in my place.
Thank you for your hospitality.

41:10.521 --> 41:14.275
It was a true awakening.

41:18.696 --> 41:21.949
The black man is gone!

41:22.116 --> 41:25.286
Praise Jesus,
the black man is gone!

41:38.841 --> 41:44.930
- I never knew she felt this way.
- You're a lucky guy.

41:45.139 --> 41:49.435
- What do I do?
- Tell her you love her.

41:49.601 --> 41:53.439
Mrs Caldwell will have me shot
if I go near her.

41:53.647 --> 41:57.693
I don't even know
her e-mail address.

41:57.860 --> 42:03.866
E-mail is for geeks and paedophiles.
Be romantic, write another letter.

42:04.074 --> 42:07.870
- How will it get to her?
- We'll make sure she gets it.

42:09.788 --> 42:13.333
- Why are you doing this for me?
- Because...

42:13.542 --> 42:18.005
We want to see Cecile happy.

42:18.213 --> 42:25.804
We know that you'd make her happy.
You'd make any girl happy.

42:30.893 --> 42:33.979
You mind if I have some privacy?

42:34.146 --> 42:39.651
My room's across the hall.
Make yourself at home.

42:53.624 --> 42:56.710
- Who are you calling?
- Cecile.

42:56.877 --> 43:03.050
- What are you doing?
- You know the damage we'll cause?

43:05.886 --> 43:08.096
I'm aware.

43:08.972 --> 43:15.187
Are you really? We've done
some fucked-up shit, but this is...

43:17.105 --> 43:19.691
We're destroying an innocent girl.

43:21.485 --> 43:26.990
Court Reynolds is going down, lf you
won't help me, someone else will.

43:27.199 --> 43:31.912
- You amaze me.
- Eat me, Sebastian.

43:32.120 --> 43:39.169
You guys can fuck everyone, but I
get dumped for twits like Cecile.

43:39.378 --> 43:43.298
God forbid I exude confidence
and enjoy sex.

43:43.507 --> 43:49.763
I must act like Mary Sunshine 24-7
so I can be considered a lady.

43:49.972 --> 43:55.394
I'm the Marcia Brady of the
East Side and I want to kill myself.

43:55.602 --> 43:58.939
There's your psychoanalysis,
Dr Freud.

43:59.106 --> 44:04.444
Now tell me,
are you in, or are you out?

44:06.238 --> 44:09.408
Call her.

44:21.503 --> 44:27.426
It's Kathryn.
Okay, stop crying.

44:27.592 --> 44:31.638
Stop crying.
Hold on for Sebastian.

44:38.186 --> 44:40.856
Cecile?

44:41.064 --> 44:45.277
Stop crying.
Listen to me very carefully.

44:45.444 --> 44:50.532
I have a letter from Ronald.
He asked me to give it to you.

44:50.741 --> 44:56.580
I can't bring it to your house, your
mother despises me, so listen...

45:30.530 --> 45:32.949
Finished.

45:39.915 --> 45:45.045
- This doesn't taste like ice tea.
- It's from Long lsland.

45:47.380 --> 45:51.426
- How's the letter?
- It's excellent.

45:53.178 --> 45:58.225
- Do you think he'll like it?
- He'll love it, Are you kidding?

46:03.021 --> 46:06.691
- What are you doing?
- Just taking a photo.

46:06.900 --> 46:12.239
- You know, you could be a model.
- Really?

46:12.447 --> 46:16.660
Too bad you're not sexy.

46:18.036 --> 46:23.458
- I can be sexy.
- All right, show me sexy.

46:28.880 --> 46:34.469
Wow, that's very sexy.
Make yourself more comfortable.

46:39.349 --> 46:42.435
No, no, Come here.

46:47.941 --> 46:50.610
Now that's sexy.

46:54.906 --> 47:00.579
Cecile, you know
what would be super-duper sexy?

47:00.787 --> 47:04.416
If you lost all the clothes.

47:06.418 --> 47:11.172
- I don't think so.
- Sorry, that was out of line.

47:11.381 --> 47:15.218
- I think I should go home now.
- I'll have your mom pick you up.

47:15.427 --> 47:17.762
You can't call my mom.

47:17.971 --> 47:26.479
Wow, she doesn't know you're here.
In fact, you're probably grounded.

47:26.688 --> 47:32.444
- I think I should call her anyway.
- I'll do anything, Don't call!

47:32.611 --> 47:37.240
Cecile...
All I want to do is give you a kiss.

47:38.408 --> 47:41.661
Just a kiss?

47:43.163 --> 47:45.915
I swear.

47:49.085 --> 47:52.964
- What are you doing?
- You promised to let me kiss you.

47:53.173 --> 47:57.635
- But then why...
- I don't want to kiss you here.

47:58.553 --> 48:01.556
I want to kiss you there.

48:03.558 --> 48:09.773
- A promise is a promise, Cecile.
- A promise is a promise...

48:15.236 --> 48:17.989
It tickles.

48:18.045 --> 48:23.717
Cecile, are you up yet?
You're going to be late for the...

48:23.884 --> 48:28.013
- Cecile?
- I need a hug.

48:28.180 --> 48:31.809
- Cecile?
- Yeah.

48:32.017 --> 48:36.313
- Jesus, where have you been?
- Shopping.

48:36.522 --> 48:41.944
Hurry up, You're supposed to be
at Mrs Rosemond's before brunch.

48:42.111 --> 48:48.117
She's very important at the school,
and I want you to look your best.

48:51.328 --> 48:55.082
- Afternoon, ladies.
- I didn't know you'd be here.

48:55.290 --> 49:00.045
Why waste such a lovely day
in the city?

49:00.254 --> 49:04.299
- Good point.
- Anyone for tennis?

49:14.685 --> 49:16.812
Excuse me.

49:18.230 --> 49:20.274
That was rude.

49:20.482 --> 49:23.819
She's very strange.

49:24.028 --> 49:28.490
- What am I going to do?
- Is something wrong?

49:28.657 --> 49:32.786
Mrs Collins is short of volunteers
at the retirement home.

49:32.953 --> 49:36.999
- But I have theatre tickets.
- That's terrible.

49:37.166 --> 49:41.712
I have a thought.
Why don't you two fill in for me?

49:41.879 --> 49:45.466
- I'd love to.
- You two are the best.

49:45.674 --> 49:53.140
- Thank you, It's so sweet of you.
- I can't help it.

49:57.311 --> 50:03.233
Isn't he beautiful? It's wonderful
when you young people help out.

50:03.442 --> 50:08.238
Most of our patients
have no family nearby.

50:08.447 --> 50:12.117
Mr Gottlieb,
we have a visitor for you.

50:12.785 --> 50:17.790
No, I've got somebody special
for you, baby.

50:18.832 --> 50:22.753
Did I ever tell you the time
when my late husband...

50:22.961 --> 50:28.884
Yes, Mrs Sugerman, you did.
Right after we played backgammon.

50:29.092 --> 50:35.140
- We played backgammon?
- You beat me three times.

50:35.349 --> 50:39.186
- Then I fucked your daughter.
- Excuse me?

50:39.394 --> 50:45.734
- I said, "Care for some water?"
- No, thank you.

50:49.696 --> 50:54.535
- Come in.
- How's it going in here?

50:54.743 --> 51:00.582
We played backgammon,
and I won three times.

51:00.791 --> 51:06.630
- That's the way to go!
- Isn't it wonderful?

51:06.838 --> 51:10.092
I told you she was special.

51:10.259 --> 51:14.721
That was fun.

51:17.808 --> 51:22.729
I actually feel good about myself.
Mrs Sugerman is cool.

51:22.938 --> 51:29.069
Come on.
Mrs Sugerman is cool?

51:29.278 --> 51:32.614
- You must think I'm an idiot.
- No.

51:32.823 --> 51:40.414
- You had a good time with her?
- I did, We played backgammon.

51:41.623 --> 51:45.836
All right, I was bored out of
my mind, I hate doing charity.

51:46.044 --> 51:51.133
It's okay.
That doesn't make you a bad person.

51:51.341 --> 51:55.554
- I can't win with you.
- It's not about winning, Sebastian.

51:58.765 --> 52:03.061
Your problem is,
you take yourself too seriously.

52:03.228 --> 52:07.774
- I do not.
- Yes, you do, Try to lighten up.

52:07.983 --> 52:13.989
I am.
Can we drop this?

52:20.787 --> 52:23.457
What are you doing?

52:24.583 --> 52:28.003
Stop it, It's distracting.

52:29.171 --> 52:33.383
Cut it out.
Stop it.

52:33.550 --> 52:38.096
- Are you smiling?
- No.

52:40.432 --> 52:43.435
Will you stop!

52:44.436 --> 52:49.107
You can relax.
I promise I won't tell anybody.

53:04.915 --> 53:08.752
- Who is it?
- It's Kathryn.

53:13.381 --> 53:17.010
- Are you okay?
- No!

53:21.598 --> 53:23.683
What's wrong?

53:23.892 --> 53:29.648
- Something bad happened last night.
- What do you mean?

53:29.815 --> 53:36.696
- I don't think you want to know.
- Cecile, you have to tell me.

53:38.198 --> 53:43.703
It involves your brother.
He... He took advantage of me.

53:43.912 --> 53:47.832
- Why didn't you do something?
- I don't know.

53:48.041 --> 53:54.047
You came to our house late at night,
and he forced intercourse on you.

53:54.256 --> 53:56.466
Not exactly.

53:56.675 --> 54:02.430
- He made you give him a blowjob?
- No...

54:02.639 --> 54:06.101
What, then?

54:07.060 --> 54:15.068
He took down my panties and
wrote the alphabet with his tongue.

54:16.236 --> 54:21.366
- He went down on you?
- If that's what you call it.

54:21.575 --> 54:24.744
- Well, did you like it?
- No.

54:24.953 --> 54:30.625
I don't know, it was weird.
At first it felt icky, -

54:30.792 --> 54:34.129
- and then it was sort of okay.

54:34.337 --> 54:42.595
Then I started getting really hot,
and then I started shaking...

54:44.014 --> 54:49.519
It was weird,
it just felt like an explosion...

54:49.728 --> 54:55.483
- But a good one.
- Cecile, you had an orgasm.

54:57.444 --> 55:03.616
- I did?
- You're becoming a woman.

55:03.825 --> 55:08.204
- I am?
- Cecile!

55:12.500 --> 55:18.256
Now that you're on your way,
it would be stupid of you to stop.

55:18.423 --> 55:22.802
Think of Sebastian as a tutor.
Let him instruct you.

55:22.969 --> 55:27.974
But I don't love him.
I love Ronald.

55:28.183 --> 55:34.647
Don't you want to make Ronald happy?
Practice makes perfect, Cecile.

55:34.856 --> 55:40.862
My advice is to sleep with
as many people as possible.

55:41.029 --> 55:44.407
That would make me a slut...
Wouldn't it?

55:44.616 --> 55:51.039
Cecile, everybody does it, It's just
that nobody talks about it.

55:54.209 --> 55:59.005
- Like a secret society?
- That's one way of looking at it.

56:01.132 --> 56:05.970
- Fucking idiot...
- Cool.

56:08.056 --> 56:11.059
Secret society, secret society...

56:19.567 --> 56:27.492
- Am I supposed to feel this sore?
- Just the first time, It'll pass.

56:31.329 --> 56:34.582
I like it better when I'm on top.

56:41.923 --> 56:44.926
Cecile...

56:47.804 --> 56:54.102
This is what I call "quiet time",
when we reflect on what we've done.

56:54.310 --> 56:57.397
Sorry.

56:59.607 --> 57:04.153
- Something's the matter?
- You think?

57:04.320 --> 57:09.450
- Is it me?
- No, you were fine.

57:09.659 --> 57:14.831
It's that Annette girl.
You love her, don't you?

57:15.039 --> 57:21.754
It's okay, I don't love you, either.
I love Ronald.

57:21.921 --> 57:26.217
- Where are you going?
- I'm taking a shower.

57:26.426 --> 57:29.095
- Want company?
- No.

57:29.304 --> 57:33.141
- Want a blowjob?
- Good night, Cecile.

57:33.808 --> 57:37.145
Prude...

57:47.822 --> 57:51.075
Who are you spying on?

57:51.242 --> 57:54.912
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

57:55.121 --> 57:59.834
She's crying, Little baby's upset
by the big bad book.

58:00.043 --> 58:03.504
- Shut up.
- What's up your ass?

58:03.713 --> 58:06.633
Nothing.

58:06.841 --> 58:11.596
- She's getting to you, isn't she?
- If you must know, yes.

58:11.804 --> 58:19.020
I can't stand her holy bullshit,
yet I'm totally infatuated with her.

58:19.854 --> 58:22.774
She made me laugh.

58:24.942 --> 58:28.363
That's why you're losing our bet?

58:28.571 --> 58:32.533
No, It's just taking longer
than I expected.

58:39.207 --> 58:44.170
Do you mind if I take
my new car for a ride?

58:44.379 --> 58:50.218
Kathryn... The only thing
you're going to be riding is me.

58:50.927 --> 58:56.432
If you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.

59:11.197 --> 59:15.660
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.
- Bonjour, monsieur Valmont.

59:36.973 --> 59:41.018
- I'm sorry about that.
- I am too.

59:42.937 --> 59:47.483
- You know what? I'm not sorry.
- I thought we'd just be friends.

59:47.692 --> 59:51.988
I can't keep my feelings
all bottled up like you.

59:52.196 --> 59:55.992
Do you honestly feel nothing for me?

59:57.618 --> 01:00:02.290
- I have feelings for you.
- Then what's wrong?

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:07.378
It's not like you have a husband,
unless you're married to Jesus.

01:00:07.587 --> 01:00:13.009
- Why can't we be together?
- Do you really want to know why?

01:00:16.387 --> 01:00:20.600
It's because
I don't trust myself with you.

01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:49.253
Come in.

01:00:58.929 --> 01:01:03.476
- I just came to say goodbye.
- Where are you going?

01:01:03.643 --> 01:01:09.148
Back to the city, Maybe to France
for the end of the summer.

01:01:09.315 --> 01:01:13.277
- I can't take your games anymore.
- What games?

01:01:13.486 --> 01:01:17.198
Come off it, You're hot one minute,
cold the next...

01:01:17.406 --> 01:01:25.289
- You make me feel inadequate.
- Then I guess it's best you leave.

01:01:25.498 --> 01:01:30.419
Sebastian... I don't want us
to part on bad terms.

01:01:30.628 --> 01:01:34.465
I'm afraid you don't have a choice
in the matter.

01:01:34.674 --> 01:01:39.220
- I don't associate with hypocrites.
- How am I a hypocrite?

01:01:39.387 --> 01:01:43.516
You spend all your time preaching
about waiting for love.

01:01:43.682 --> 01:01:50.731
Now you're turning your back on it.
So I guess we're just fucked.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:58.864
I'll move on, but you'll always know
that you turned your back on love.

01:01:59.073 --> 01:02:03.369
That makes you a hypocrite.

01:02:07.039 --> 01:02:10.584
Have a nice life.

01:02:11.419 --> 01:02:14.422
Wait...

01:03:23.657 --> 01:03:26.243
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:50.768
Get it together, you pussy.

01:04:10.663 --> 01:04:14.208
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:04:14.416 --> 01:04:19.630
- So, how did it go last night?
- With who?

01:04:19.838 --> 01:04:22.675
Not Cecile, I know all about that.

01:04:25.302 --> 01:04:28.138
No, I didn't nail her.

01:04:28.305 --> 01:04:32.685
- She shot you down?
- Exactly the opposite.

01:04:32.893 --> 01:04:35.729
What went wrong?

01:04:39.024 --> 01:04:41.777
I don't know.

01:04:41.985 --> 01:04:50.244
She was lying on the bed,
ready to do it, and I was...

01:04:52.246 --> 01:04:59.211
- I just didn't feel right about it.
- You had your chance, and didn't?

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:11.640
- She's not in her room.
- Where is she?

01:05:11.849 --> 01:05:16.562
She left 30 minutes ago.

01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:19.606
Where did she go?

01:05:19.773 --> 01:05:27.364
She told your aunt
she was going to stay with friends.

01:05:27.573 --> 01:05:31.785
You blew it.
That girl's come to her senses.

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:36.457
She'll never go near you again.

01:05:36.665 --> 01:05:42.504
Stupid, stupid...
"Judy", I'll save that one.

01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:48.093
It's Valmont, Is she with you?

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:52.556
No, I don't know where she is.
Why don't you leave her alone?

01:05:52.723 --> 01:05:58.145
- Where is she?
- She's staying with the Mihallaks.

01:05:58.312 --> 01:06:03.483
She caught a train into Penn Station
about 20 minutes ago.

01:07:09.174 --> 01:07:15.347
- I'm impressed.
- I'm in love.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:57.556
Are you okay?

01:09:47.499 --> 01:09:50.417
Just a minute.

01:09:54.589 --> 01:09:56.925
Come in.

01:09:59.844 --> 01:10:02.514
- Bad time?
- Kind of.

01:10:02.722 --> 01:10:10.981
You invited me in so I could witness
your little adventure.

01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:15.819
Who is our friend
who gives you such pleasure?

01:10:17.821 --> 01:10:20.365
Where could he be?

01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:35.171
- Fucked-up shit in this house...
- Call me.

01:10:39.926 --> 01:10:44.139
You don't get to have all the fun.

01:10:47.726 --> 01:10:52.022
I assume you've come here
to make arrangements.

01:10:55.483 --> 01:10:58.153
Some other time.

01:10:58.361 --> 01:11:01.948
- Excuse me?
- I'm not in the mood.

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:06.286
- I want to fuck.
- And I don't.

01:11:07.996 --> 01:11:10.457
Good afternoon, Kathryn.

01:11:13.752 --> 01:11:18.673
Sounds great.
I love you, too.

01:11:18.882 --> 01:11:22.594
"I love you, too..."

01:11:27.807 --> 01:11:31.644
You're completely pussy-whipped.

01:11:31.853 --> 01:11:35.482
- Stop it.
- What happened to us?

01:11:36.566 --> 01:11:40.612
- Nothing has changed.
- Yes, it has.

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:46.159
- You don't love me anymore.
- Come on, it's just a bet.

01:12:01.508 --> 01:12:08.556
- This is ridiculous.
- You're ridiculous, dear brother.

01:12:08.723 --> 01:12:15.688
Look what you've been reduced to.
What'll happen when school starts?

01:12:15.897 --> 01:12:21.486
You're dating Miss Seventeen
Magazine, the headmaster's daughter.

01:12:21.653 --> 01:12:26.407
Before you know it, you'll be
giving campus tours with her.

01:12:26.616 --> 01:12:31.579
Her father doesn't know
about your past, does he?

01:12:31.788 --> 01:12:37.377
I doubt he'd let his little princess
be seen with you.

01:12:37.585 --> 01:12:41.965
It's disappointing to see Annette's
manifesto was a total sham.

01:12:42.173 --> 01:12:48.388
As student body president,
I feel it's my duty to tell him.

01:12:51.182 --> 01:12:55.812
- Put the phone down.
- This won't take a second.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.069
Quite the predicament you're in.

01:13:04.487 --> 01:13:11.786
I was planning on telling her
everything this afternoon.

01:13:11.995 --> 01:13:17.667
That's right, I forgot.
You're so in love.

01:13:17.834 --> 01:13:23.923
You honestly believe you've changed
in the few days you've known her?

01:13:24.132 --> 01:13:29.178
Let me tell you something.
People don't change overnight.

01:13:29.387 --> 01:13:34.225
You and I are two of a kind.
I'm not afraid to admit it.

01:13:36.811 --> 01:13:41.107
You were going to leave school
a legend, now you'll leave a joke.

01:13:41.316 --> 01:13:46.404
- I'm willing to take my chances.
- Don't do it, Sebastian.

01:13:46.612 --> 01:13:53.578
You won't only ruin your reputation,
you'll destroy hers.

01:15:04.482 --> 01:15:07.151
This is my room.

01:15:11.572 --> 01:15:14.116
Can we be quiet?

01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:20.581
- I have something to tell you.
- Tell me.

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:26.045
- This isn't working out for me.
- Yeah, me neither.

01:15:30.591 --> 01:15:36.889
- What's wrong?
- It's me, I'm completely fucked up.

01:15:37.098 --> 01:15:39.767
What are you saying?

01:15:47.358 --> 01:15:52.321
I thought I was in love with you,
but it was just a lie.

01:15:52.530 --> 01:15:56.033
I wanted it to work,
but unfortunately I feel nothing.

01:15:56.951 --> 01:16:03.082
- Why are you doing this?
- I wanted to get you into bed.

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:07.670
You don't mean that.

01:16:07.878 --> 01:16:12.425
You know nothing.
You don't even know me.

01:16:12.633 --> 01:16:16.012
The fact is,
there is someone I love.

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:21.434
- You don't even compare to her.
- I don't believe you.

01:16:21.642 --> 01:16:28.441
I don't know how to make it clearer.
You mean nothing to me.

01:16:28.649 --> 01:16:33.321
You were just...
You were just a conquest.

01:16:34.572 --> 01:16:37.742
You're such a coward.
Look, you're shaking.

01:16:39.535 --> 01:16:43.831
- Is that what you came to tell me?
- I'm sorry, I'm completely...

01:16:43.998 --> 01:16:46.751
You're completely fucked up.

01:16:48.127 --> 01:16:50.421
Get out.

01:16:51.505 --> 01:16:54.091
Get out!

01:16:59.305 --> 01:17:03.684
Don't touch me...
Don't touch me.

01:17:04.518 --> 01:17:08.898
Don't fucking touch me, Sebastian!

01:17:14.028 --> 01:17:16.947
Just leave.

01:18:03.661 --> 01:18:06.997
Jesus...
A bit melodramatic, don't you think?

01:18:07.164 --> 01:18:11.544
I thought you'd like to know
what happened with Annette.

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:18.926
It's over.

01:18:19.635 --> 01:18:24.348
- Really?
- You were right.

01:18:24.557 --> 01:18:28.477
I can't change.
You and I are two of a kind.

01:18:31.272 --> 01:18:38.237
- I thought we should celebrate.
- Sorry, I'm expecting some company.

01:18:40.155 --> 01:18:46.287
- Who? Ronald?
- Not that it concerns you, but yes.

01:18:47.538 --> 01:18:51.083
From Ronald.
I haven't had a chance to read it, -

01:18:51.292 --> 01:18:56.964
- but I'm pretty sure
it goes something like:

01:18:57.131 --> 01:19:03.053
"You mean a lot to me,
I hope we can be friends, etc,"

01:19:05.347 --> 01:19:13.022
I expected this shit, so I took the
liberty of getting them together.

01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:18.569
You were right, You do get dumped
for the innocent little twits.

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:23.991
- Well done.
- Thank you.

01:19:24.199 --> 01:19:28.037
Now... Where were we?

01:19:29.288 --> 01:19:34.001
Oh yes, the celebration.

01:19:36.378 --> 01:19:40.758
- What shall we toast to?
- To my triumph.

01:19:43.594 --> 01:19:50.643
Not my choice, but it's your call.
To your triumph over Annette.

01:19:53.979 --> 01:19:58.901
- What's so funny?
- Silly boy...

01:19:59.109 --> 01:20:02.613
My triumph isn't over her.

01:20:05.949 --> 01:20:10.412
- It's over you.
- Again?

01:20:10.579 --> 01:20:17.044
You were very much in love with her.
And you're still in love with her.

01:20:17.252 --> 01:20:21.298
But it amused me
to make you ashamed of it.

01:20:21.465 --> 01:20:27.554
You gave up your first love because
I threatened your reputation.

01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:34.728
Don't you get it?
You're just a toy, Sebastian.

01:20:34.937 --> 01:20:39.233
A little toy I like to play with.

01:20:39.441 --> 01:20:42.444
And now you've blown it with her.

01:20:42.653 --> 01:20:48.242
I think it's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

01:20:48.408 --> 01:20:52.955
Cheers.

01:20:57.417 --> 01:20:59.545
It tastes good.

01:21:06.051 --> 01:21:13.725
You came to make arrangements,
but I don't fuck losers.

01:21:25.863 --> 01:21:28.282
Goodbye, Sebastian.

01:21:29.867 --> 01:21:35.372
- It's imperative I talk to her.
- She's not here.

01:21:35.581 --> 01:21:40.294
- Will you please tell her I called?
- Of course I will.

01:22:24.463 --> 01:22:27.299
- Yes?
- I need to speak to Annette.

01:22:27.507 --> 01:22:31.803
She's not here.
I'm entertaining some guests...

01:22:32.971 --> 01:22:37.726
I already told you she is not here.

01:22:37.934 --> 01:22:41.188
- Will you see she gets this?
- Yes.

01:22:41.355 --> 01:22:44.274
- It's really important.
- I understand.

01:22:50.989 --> 01:22:56.411
I'm terribly sorry, You never know
who's going to show up here.

01:23:14.054 --> 01:23:19.726
"Dear Annette, what can I say to
rectify the harm I've caused you?"

01:23:19.935 --> 01:23:24.606
"Being with you was the only time
I've ever been happy,"

01:23:24.815 --> 01:23:28.735
"My whole life has been a joke,"

01:23:28.944 --> 01:23:32.489
"I prided myself on taking joy
in others' misery,"

01:23:32.697 --> 01:23:37.411
"Well, it finally backfired,"

01:23:37.619 --> 01:23:41.415
"I succeeded in hurting
the first person I loved,"

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:48.046
"Enclosed is my most
prized possession, My journal,"

01:23:49.214 --> 01:23:54.886
"I considered it my trophy.
A collection of my conquests,"

01:23:55.929 --> 01:24:01.852
"If you want to know the truth,
please read it, No more lies,"

01:24:14.489 --> 01:24:20.078
"Please give me another chance.
I'm a wreck without you,"

01:24:47.939 --> 01:24:53.778
- Ronald? It's Kathryn.
- What's up?

01:24:54.738 --> 01:24:58.867
- Is everything okay?
- No.

01:24:59.034 --> 01:25:03.580
It's Sebastian.
He's out of his mind.

01:25:03.788 --> 01:25:09.377
He hit me, then he took off.
I'm afraid to be alone.

01:25:09.586 --> 01:25:12.672
- Ronald, I really need you.
- Settle down.

01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:18.887
There's more.
It involves Cecile.

01:25:19.095 --> 01:25:23.016
Stay there, I'll be right over.

01:26:40.552 --> 01:26:42.637
Son of a bitch...

01:26:44.973 --> 01:26:48.852
- Valmont!
- Hey, Ronald.

01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:54.566
- We have some talking to do.
- Later, I've had a real bad night.

01:26:54.774 --> 01:26:59.237
- What's your problem?
- Why did you hit Kathryn?

01:26:59.446 --> 01:27:04.284
She got to you, too...
You don't know what you're saying.

01:27:04.492 --> 01:27:08.621
She also said you fucked Cecile.

01:27:09.831 --> 01:27:14.294
- It's true, isn't it?
- Ronald, I'm sorry...

01:27:23.178 --> 01:27:25.722
Sebastian?

01:27:27.098 --> 01:27:29.767
Sebastian!

01:27:30.894 --> 01:27:33.313
Stop it!

01:27:43.323 --> 01:27:45.658
Annette!

01:28:03.343 --> 01:28:06.596
Sebastian...

01:28:08.306 --> 01:28:14.062
- I love you, Annette.
- I love you, too.

01:28:22.487 --> 01:28:25.156
Just hold on...

01:28:35.625 --> 01:28:40.088
As the new headmaster
of Manchester Prep -

01:28:40.254 --> 01:28:45.593
- it saddens me to start our
new year with such a mournful tone.

01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:13.413
- I didn't know anyone was in here.
- I'm sorry.

01:29:13.621 --> 01:29:17.041
- Annette Hargrove.
- Kathryn Merteuil.

01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:21.546
- Have we met?
- I don't think so.

01:29:21.713 --> 01:29:26.843
- Your father's the new headmaster?
- That's right.

01:29:27.051 --> 01:29:31.264
I'm sorry to hear
about your brother, Are you okay?

01:29:31.472 --> 01:29:36.894
I'll be fine.
Did you know Sebastian?

01:29:37.103 --> 01:29:40.022
You might say that.

01:29:40.231 --> 01:29:43.985
Such a tragedy, isn't it?

01:29:45.027 --> 01:29:49.824
Yes, it is.
I'll leave you alone now.

01:29:53.411 --> 01:29:57.457
I'm here if you need a friend.

01:29:57.623 --> 01:30:00.877
That's great.

01:30:01.085 --> 01:30:05.047
Sometimes when I feel
I can't go on, -

01:30:05.256 --> 01:30:09.927
- I turn to Jesus,
and He helps me through it.

01:30:10.136 --> 01:30:16.058
- Thank you.
- I'll see you around campus.

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:20.730
Looking forward to it...

01:30:20.938 --> 01:30:23.608
...freak.

01:30:27.361 --> 01:30:29.906
Here we go.

01:30:32.909 --> 01:30:37.872
However dark the cloud,
there's always a silver lining.

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:43.419
It might be hard to see,
but what we should learn from this -

01:30:43.628 --> 01:30:48.007
- is to be true to ourselves
and to resist peer pressure.

01:30:48.216 --> 01:30:55.014
As student body president I've tried
to set an example in myself.

01:30:55.223 --> 01:31:01.812
Unfortunately, I couldn't reach out
to my stepbrother in time.

01:31:02.021 --> 01:31:07.235
I know he's looking down
on us today and...

01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:14.283
I know he'd want me to say...

01:31:17.703 --> 01:31:22.333
He'd want me to say, "Kathryn..."

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:27.588
He'd want me to say,
"Kathryn, I'm sorry,"

01:31:27.797 --> 01:31:31.759
What is going on?
Don't you have any respect?

01:31:32.305 --> 01:31:38.434
