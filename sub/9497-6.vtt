03:49.417 --> 03:50.459

04:07.250 --> 04:08.959

<b>You know, I didn't--</b>

04:19.000 --> 04:21.166
<b>If you want to go,</b>
<b>you can just go.</b>

04:21.959 --> 04:23.000

04:26.667 --> 04:27.709
<b>- Yeah, okay.</b>

04:28.751 --> 04:29.792
<b>- Hey, I mean--</b>

04:30.167 --> 04:32.083
<b>I’m not sure what's going on</b>
<b>with you.</b>

04:32.417 --> 04:33.626
<b>This is always weird, but...</b>

04:35.501 --> 04:36.959
<b>We're total strangers,</b>
<b>but I mean,</b>

04:37.375 --> 04:38.834
<b>if you would just tell me...</b>

04:39.959 --> 04:42.876
<b>I mean, are you disappointed</b>
<b>in my looks or...?</b>

04:43.334 --> 04:44.584
<b>- I’m not.</b>

04:44.667 --> 04:45.918
<b>- Because you should know,</b>
<b>I mean, if that's the case,</b>

04:46.209 --> 04:47.709
<b>that doesn't--</b>
<b>That doesn't hurt my feelings.</b>

04:47.792 --> 04:49.959
<b>- I'm not, you're the one.</b>
<b>- I'm the one what?</b>

04:51.709 --> 04:52.751
<b>- Look, I--</b>

04:53.626 --> 04:56.042
<b>I was pretty damn honest on my</b>
<b>profile, you know?</b>

04:56.292 --> 04:59.501
<b>I put my real age</b>
<b>and a current picture</b>

04:59.959 --> 05:05.584
<b>and a preference for women in my</b>
<b>age group, so I expect to meet</b>

05:05.667 --> 05:07.876
<b>someone who's</b>
<b>expecting me, okay?</b>

05:07.959 --> 05:14.292
<b>Because it's not exactly fun to</b>
<b>show up and-- and see a cute</b>

05:14.375 --> 05:16.292
<b>young girl looking at me like,</b>
<b>booby prize.</b>

05:17.209 --> 05:18.501
<b>Do you think that's fun for me?</b>

05:18.584 --> 05:20.000
<b>- Whoa, wait a minute.</b>
<b>I’m not--</b>

05:20.083 --> 05:22.334
<b>- Maybe you should just be</b>
<b>a little bit more careful about</b>

05:22.417 --> 05:24.876
<b>looking at the person</b>
<b>that you choose.</b>

05:25.709 --> 05:27.000
<b>You know, I mean,</b>
<b>what did you expect?</b>

05:27.083 --> 05:28.125
<b>- I expected you.</b>

05:29.000 --> 05:30.459
<b>You look exactly</b>
<b>like your picture.</b>

05:31.000 --> 05:32.459
<b>You look your age, you should...</b>

05:32.626 --> 05:33.667
<b>look your age.</b>

05:34.584 --> 05:36.501
<b>- Were you gonna tell me</b>
<b>you look 45?</b>

05:37.334 --> 05:38.375
<b>- Okay, look...</b>

05:39.083 --> 05:40.125
<b>I'm the one, okay?</b>

05:41.209 --> 05:42.417
<b>I put myself as older.</b>

05:44.083 --> 05:45.292
<b>- Why do you do that?</b>

05:45.459 --> 05:46.501
<b>- Because, I don't know.</b>

05:46.959 --> 05:48.209
<b>Can we just look at the food?</b>

05:48.292 --> 05:50.626
<b>Because, I’m actually hungry.</b>

05:51.626 --> 05:53.792
<b>Or do you really just</b>
<b>want to leave now?</b>

05:55.834 --> 05:57.959
<b>- Yeah, let's look at the food.</b>

06:05.250 --> 06:06.292
<b>- What are you getting?</b>

06:07.000 --> 06:09.459
<b>- Why do you put</b>
<b>yourself as older?</b>

06:09.751 --> 06:11.375
<b>I mean--</b>
<b>I mean, who does that?</b>

06:11.459 --> 06:12.709
<b>Nobody does that.</b>

06:12.792 --> 06:13.792
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- I’m sorry, I--</b>

06:13.876 --> 06:15.334
<b>I mean, I don't get it.</b>

06:15.918 --> 06:18.459
<b>- Well, we can talk</b>
<b>about this, but...</b>

06:19.792 --> 06:21.000
<b>I don't really know you.</b>

06:22.375 --> 06:24.417
<b>And you're not really letting</b>
<b>the conversation get started,</b>

06:24.542 --> 06:26.542
<b>so how do we get--</b>
<b>- You sort of put us behind</b>

06:26.626 --> 06:30.209
<b>the eight-ball by lying about</b>
<b>your age from jump.</b>

06:30.709 --> 06:32.375
<b>I mean, how old are you, really?</b>

06:36.125 --> 06:37.626
<b>I mean, maybe we</b>
<b>should just go.</b>

06:37.709 --> 06:38.751
<b>- I'm 26.</b>

06:40.375 --> 06:41.417
<b>- Okay, well...</b>

06:42.876 --> 06:43.918
<b>That's young.</b>

06:44.501 --> 06:47.334
<b>I mean, I’m old enough to be</b>
<b>your ancestor.</b>

06:47.501 --> 06:48.542
<b>- Not really.</b>

06:49.334 --> 06:50.876
<b>- Come on, when I was</b>
<b>in high school,</b>

06:50.959 --> 06:53.209
<b>your parents were in</b>
<b>junior high school.</b>

06:53.459 --> 06:54.709
<b>- My dad is older than you.</b>

06:54.792 --> 06:56.709
<b>It's not as bad</b>
<b>as you're making it.</b>

06:57.083 --> 06:58.876
<b>- Well, so why-- why then--</b>

06:58.959 --> 07:00.000
<b>- I like older guys.</b>

07:01.667 --> 07:02.709
<b>- Okay, but see...</b>

07:04.167 --> 07:06.000
<b>I didn't, you know...</b>

07:06.918 --> 07:08.834
<b>Put that I want</b>
<b>younger woman, all right?</b>

07:10.459 --> 07:12.751
<b>I mean, I know some guys</b>
<b>do that, but I didn't.</b>

07:12.834 --> 07:14.667
<b>You know, I mean,</b>
<b>I'm not like that.</b>

07:14.751 --> 07:16.000
<b>- I know.</b>

07:16.083 --> 07:17.542
<b>I don't like guys that are.</b>

07:18.375 --> 07:20.667
<b>See, I like older guys,</b>

07:20.751 --> 07:23.167
<b>but I don't like older guys that</b>
<b>like younger women.</b>

07:23.584 --> 07:25.250
<b>Those kinds of guys are a drag.</b>

07:25.918 --> 07:26.959
<b>I like...</b>

07:27.709 --> 07:28.751
<b>I don't know.</b>

07:31.626 --> 07:32.667
<b>- Okay, well...</b>

07:33.876 --> 07:35.334
<b>What do you want to do?</b>

07:36.626 --> 07:38.083
<b>- Well, we could just go now.</b>

07:38.792 --> 07:39.834
<b>Since it's all weird.</b>

07:41.959 --> 07:44.584
<b>Or we could have</b>
<b>dinner and talk.</b>

07:45.000 --> 07:47.626
<b>waiter: Hi. Can I get you guys</b>
<b>a drink to start?</b>

07:48.501 --> 07:50.209
<b>- Um...</b>
<b>- I'm okay with water.</b>

07:51.209 --> 07:52.417
<b>- I'll have a white wine.</b>

07:52.834 --> 07:54.083
<b>Do you have anything</b>
<b>that's okay?</b>

07:54.167 --> 07:55.626
<b>waiter: I have a pinot grigio.</b>

07:55.834 --> 07:56.876
<b>- Yeah, sure.</b>
<b>Thanks.</b>

08:05.626 --> 08:06.667
<b>- So...</b>

08:07.542 --> 08:09.209
<b>What do you want to talk about?</b>

08:10.000 --> 08:11.042
<b>- Um...</b>

08:12.792 --> 08:13.834
<b>What do you do?</b>

08:16.042 --> 08:17.250
<b>- I work at a bar.</b>

08:17.542 --> 08:18.584
<b>- Oh, cool.</b>

08:20.459 --> 08:22.584
<b>- Why?</b>
<b>Why-- Why is that cool?</b>

08:24.584 --> 08:27.042
<b>- Because--</b>
<b>I don't know.</b>

08:29.000 --> 08:30.918
<b>'Cause you won't really talk,</b>
<b>because you're mad</b>

08:31.125 --> 08:32.375
<b>and being weird,</b>

08:32.458 --> 08:33.833
<b>and so I just said "cool"</b>

08:34.542 --> 08:38.417
<b>because you're doing nothing</b>
<b>to make me comfortable.</b>

08:38.542 --> 08:39.583
<b>- Sorry.</b>
<b>I’m sorry.</b>

08:40.125 --> 08:43.125
<b>It's just "what do you do"</b>
<b>doesn't exactly raise my stock</b>

08:43.208 --> 08:45.501
<b>any further, all right?</b>

08:45.584 --> 08:50.167
<b>I mean, I work in a bar,</b>
<b>it's my family's bar.</b>

08:50.334 --> 08:52.083
<b>And...</b>

08:52.250 --> 08:54.667
<b>I-- I keep the place clean</b>
<b>and in ship shape,</b>

08:55.000 --> 08:57.417
<b>and I live in</b>
<b>a small room in the back.</b>

08:58.417 --> 08:59.459
<b>It's not exactly impressive.</b>

09:00.417 --> 09:01.459
<b>- Well... so?</b>

09:02.751 --> 09:04.667
<b>I’m a temp and a barista</b>
<b>and I have a stupid blog</b>

09:04.751 --> 09:06.667
<b>about books I stopped writing</b>
<b>two years ago.</b>

09:06.792 --> 09:08.542
<b>No one's impressive anymore.</b>

09:15.959 --> 09:17.417
<b>You're really just</b>
<b>gonna have water?</b>

09:17.751 --> 09:18.792
<b>- Well, I don't drink.</b>

09:19.250 --> 09:20.626
<b>- Mm.</b>

09:20.709 --> 09:21.751
<b>That's actually</b>
<b>pretty refreshing.</b>

09:22.417 --> 09:23.626
<b>Almost everyone I know drinks.</b>

09:24.250 --> 09:25.292
<b>It's boring, you know?</b>

09:25.584 --> 09:27.042
<b>Well, most people</b>
<b>my age, anyway.</b>

09:28.083 --> 09:29.751
<b>I’m so sick of boys my age.</b>

09:30.584 --> 09:31.626
<b>- Yeah, you said that.</b>

09:33.959 --> 09:35.876
<b>So, I mean,</b>
<b>you like older guys, huh?</b>

09:36.375 --> 09:39.042
<b>Does that, like, float your boat</b>
<b>or whatever?</b>

09:39.626 --> 09:42.042
<b>- If you ever tried dating boys</b>
<b>my age, you'd understand.</b>

09:44.209 --> 09:46.834
<b>You don't even realize,</b>
<b>you're a person.</b>

09:47.792 --> 09:51.334
<b>You held the door open for me,</b>
<b>you slid out my chair.</b>

09:52.042 --> 09:53.083
<b>You dressed up.</b>

09:54.292 --> 09:56.918
<b>Boys just show up all smelly</b>
<b>and look at the floor.</b>

09:58.667 --> 10:03.042
<b>You seem like you were</b>
<b>well-raised, like someone taught</b>

10:03.125 --> 10:04.167
<b>you manners and chivalry.</b>

10:06.125 --> 10:07.167
<b>- I mean, not really.</b>

10:08.959 --> 10:10.667
<b>I used to watch</b>
<b>a lot of old movies.</b>

10:10.751 --> 10:11.792
<b>Um...</b>

10:12.459 --> 10:13.501
<b>Guys like Cary Grant.</b>

10:15.375 --> 10:19.626
<b>I don't know, you don't need</b>
<b>somebody to tell you to treat</b>

10:19.709 --> 10:20.959
<b>a lady with respect,</b>

10:21.042 --> 10:22.959
<b>it's something that you're</b>
<b>just compelled to do.</b>

10:24.501 --> 10:27.250
<b>You know, I mean, because women</b>
<b>are special.</b>

10:28.125 --> 10:32.209
<b>And I don't mean like that,</b>
<b>like, uh, you're lesser than men</b>

10:32.292 --> 10:33.334
<b>or anything, or different.</b>

10:34.834 --> 10:37.250
<b>In fact, I feel that women</b>
<b>and men are equals.</b>

10:37.834 --> 10:39.083
<b>- I don't.</b>

10:39.959 --> 10:41.792
<b>- You don’t?</b>
<b>- No.</b>

10:41.876 --> 10:44.292
<b>I mean, depending on how you're</b>
<b>measuring, in some ways,</b>

10:44.417 --> 10:46.083
<b>we're better than men,</b>
<b>or above men,</b>

10:46.292 --> 10:48.751
<b>but other ways,</b>
<b>you guys are way ahead.</b>

10:50.042 --> 10:51.083
<b>- Yeah?</b>
<b>- Yeah, of course.</b>

10:53.876 --> 10:55.876
<b>- That would get a guy killed</b>

10:55.959 --> 10:57.918
<b>for saying that these days.</b>
<b>- Who cares?</b>

10:58.125 --> 11:01.501
<b>I mean, what fun would it be if</b>
<b>we were totally alike and equal?</b>

11:02.542 --> 11:03.584
<b>- Yeah, I guess.</b>

11:04.542 --> 11:07.834
<b>- Like, men are stronger than</b>
<b>women, you know, physically.</b>

11:08.626 --> 11:09.876
<b>I mean, and that's a turn-on,</b>

11:09.959 --> 11:11.876
<b>that's part of what we like</b>
<b>about you.</b>

11:12.083 --> 11:13.876
<b>- Well, I’m not that strong.</b>

11:14.250 --> 11:15.918
<b>- Yeah, but you could</b>
<b>knock me out.</b>

11:16.918 --> 11:19.250
<b>I mean, you could hold me down.</b>

11:19.459 --> 11:22.584
<b>If we were in a fight, you could</b>
<b>fuck me up really bad.</b>

11:22.834 --> 11:23.876
<b>- Okay.</b>

11:24.918 --> 11:26.584
<b>- I’m sorry, I’m being--</b>
<b>I'm being weird.</b>

11:27.083 --> 11:29.626
<b>- Yeah, kind of.</b>
<b>- Uh, it's just--</b>

11:29.959 --> 11:31.167
<b>You know, it's the truth.</b>

11:31.417 --> 11:33.083
<b>It's stupid to pretend</b>
<b>that it isn't.</b>

11:33.375 --> 11:35.584
<b>Men can run faster</b>
<b>and hit harder.</b>

11:37.834 --> 11:40.083
<b>I don't care how butch</b>
<b>or tough a woman is.</b>

11:40.167 --> 11:41.417
<b>When she's gotta move,</b>

11:41.501 --> 11:43.667
<b>she calls some guys to pick up</b>
<b>her furniture.</b>

11:44.667 --> 11:46.834
<b>And sure, she'll have</b>
<b>her hair in a ponytail</b>

11:47.083 --> 11:48.751
<b>and she'll put on a tank top.</b>

11:49.501 --> 11:52.375
<b>But at the end of the day,</b>
<b>there's gonna be some guys</b>

11:52.751 --> 11:53.959
<b>coming to lift that shit.</b>

11:55.000 --> 11:56.042
<b>Come on.</b>

11:56.459 --> 11:57.501
<b>- Yeah, true.</b>

11:58.042 --> 11:59.083
<b>But... uh...</b>

11:59.792 --> 12:02.626
<b>women are morally superior,</b>
<b>I think.</b>

12:03.209 --> 12:04.667
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>
<b>Are you serious?</b>

12:04.918 --> 12:06.167
<b>- Yeah, I think so. I mean,</b>

12:06.250 --> 12:08.125
<b>if I was gonna</b>
<b>trust someone,</b>

12:08.209 --> 12:09.667
<b>it would be a woman first.</b>

12:10.125 --> 12:13.751
<b>They're gentler</b>
<b>and more thoughtful.</b>

12:16.918 --> 12:17.959
<b>- You know, Pete.</b>

12:19.083 --> 12:21.501
<b>You have a lot more good</b>
<b>qualities than you think.</b>

12:22.542 --> 12:23.751
<b>- Why do you say that?</b>

12:25.125 --> 12:26.584
<b>- I think you</b>
<b>sell yourself short.</b>

12:28.292 --> 12:30.209
<b>- I don't.</b>
<b>I know I have good qualities.</b>

12:30.334 --> 12:31.584
<b>- You do?</b>

12:31.667 --> 12:33.292
<b>- Sure.</b>
<b>- Like what?</b>

12:34.375 --> 12:35.626
<b>I’m interested in what</b>
<b>you see in yourself.</b>

12:35.709 --> 12:36.751
<b>That's interesting.</b>

12:37.042 --> 12:38.083
<b>- I don't know.</b>

12:39.959 --> 12:41.209
<b>- Yes, you do.</b>
<b>You just said you do.</b>

12:41.292 --> 12:42.542
<b>Come on, tell me what</b>
<b>you know to be some</b>

12:42.626 --> 12:43.667
<b>of your good qualities.</b>

12:46.542 --> 12:47.584
<b>- Um...</b>

12:49.709 --> 12:50.751
<b>I’m fit.</b>

12:51.375 --> 12:53.042
<b>I mean, I’m not a fat guy.</b>

12:54.083 --> 12:55.125
<b>And, um... (clearing throat)</b>

12:57.709 --> 13:01.667
<b>I think the left side of my face</b>
<b>is handsome.</b>

13:01.751 --> 13:02.792
<b>- You do?</b>

13:03.250 --> 13:04.501
<b>- Yeah, I do.</b>

13:04.584 --> 13:07.000
<b>I mean, when I look at myself</b>
<b>from that angle,</b>

13:08.167 --> 13:09.792
<b>I know it looks good.</b>

13:09.876 --> 13:11.125
<b>(laughs)</b>

13:11.209 --> 13:12.250
<b>- Wow.</b>

13:13.459 --> 13:14.501
<b>Good.</b>

13:15.334 --> 13:16.375
<b>That's attractive.</b>

13:17.584 --> 13:19.751
<b>Well, that you're aware</b>
<b>of your own good looks.</b>

13:20.876 --> 13:22.334
<b>What else is good about you?</b>

13:24.792 --> 13:25.834
<b>- Um...</b>

13:26.626 --> 13:27.834
<b>I have a good memory.</b>

13:28.334 --> 13:29.584
<b>- You do?</b>

13:29.667 --> 13:31.125
<b>- Yeah, kind of</b>
<b>a perfect memory.</b>

13:31.459 --> 13:33.709
<b>- Like, you remember</b>
<b>a lot of detail or you remember</b>

13:33.792 --> 13:34.834
<b>very far back?</b>

13:35.167 --> 13:36.209
<b>- Both.</b>

13:37.876 --> 13:39.876
<b>- Well, what's--</b>
<b>What's an early memory?</b>

13:39.959 --> 13:41.792
<b>Like, what's your</b>
<b>earliest memory?</b>

13:43.626 --> 13:44.876
<b>- Uh...</b>

13:44.959 --> 13:46.209
<b>Like, Easter.</b>

13:46.292 --> 13:47.542
<b>- Easter?</b>

13:47.626 --> 13:48.834
<b>- Yeah, when I was three.</b>

13:50.000 --> 13:51.042
<b>- Was it nice?</b>

13:52.209 --> 13:53.626
<b>- I don't remember</b>
<b>the whole day,</b>

13:53.876 --> 13:56.167
<b>but I remember a lot of Easters,</b>

13:56.375 --> 13:59.334
<b>because it's a big</b>
<b>thing at the bar.</b>

14:00.000 --> 14:01.667
<b>You know, at our-- at our place.</b>

14:02.626 --> 14:05.042
<b>Yeah, every year, we do a big</b>
<b>shindig on Easter.</b>

14:05.542 --> 14:06.584
<b>- That sounds nice.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

14:07.584 --> 14:12.417
<b>So this Easter, when I was</b>
<b>three, there was this</b>

14:12.501 --> 14:15.751
<b>very old guy and I guess he came</b>
<b>into the place a lot,</b>

14:16.250 --> 14:17.459
<b>and he came that Easter,</b>

14:18.542 --> 14:20.250
<b>and you know, I was there with</b>
<b>all the other kids</b>

14:20.334 --> 14:24.334
<b>and we were eating some kind of</b>
<b>chocolate, and this old guy,</b>

14:24.959 --> 14:26.000
<b>he, uh--</b>

14:28.125 --> 14:31.083
<b>he bends over and he gets this</b>
<b>really weird look on his face,</b>

14:31.167 --> 14:34.751
<b>and he's holding a paper plate</b>
<b>with ham on it or something,</b>

14:35.626 --> 14:37.626
<b>and then all of a sudden,</b>
<b>he drops the plate,</b>

14:38.959 --> 14:40.167
<b>and he starts throwing up,</b>

14:40.626 --> 14:43.334
<b>like, black blood</b>
<b>all over the floor.</b>

14:44.542 --> 14:45.584
<b>Um... and, uh...</b>

14:47.167 --> 14:48.375
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>
<b>- And he--</b>

14:48.792 --> 14:49.834
<b>And he died.</b>

14:51.250 --> 14:52.292
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

14:52.918 --> 14:53.959
<b>- Yeah.</b>

14:54.292 --> 14:55.542
<b>And...</b>

14:55.626 --> 14:58.083
<b>You know, the second he fell,</b>
<b>we could all smell</b>

14:58.167 --> 15:00.083
<b>that he shit himself,</b>

15:00.417 --> 15:03.167
<b>and even though I was three,</b>
<b>I knew he was dead.</b>

15:03.709 --> 15:06.334
<b>And ever since then, I haven't</b>
<b>been able to eat chocolate.</b>

15:08.459 --> 15:09.501
<b>- Jesus.</b>

15:10.542 --> 15:11.584
<b>That's horrible.</b>

15:12.417 --> 15:14.334
<b>- Well, I said I had</b>
<b>a good memory,</b>

15:15.083 --> 15:16.542
<b>not that I have good memories.</b>

15:23.292 --> 15:26.167
<b>Well, what are some of your good</b>
<b>qualities that you're aware of?</b>

15:26.501 --> 15:27.542
<b>- Um...</b>

15:29.709 --> 15:30.751
<b>Oh, God.</b>

15:31.459 --> 15:33.125
<b>- Come on, what do you got?</b>
<b>- Mm.</b>

15:35.876 --> 15:36.918
<b>I’m good at...</b>

15:39.334 --> 15:40.375
<b>Nothing.</b>

15:41.083 --> 15:42.125
<b>Pretty much.</b>

15:43.083 --> 15:44.292
<b>Oh, no, this is lame.</b>

15:44.667 --> 15:45.918
<b>I made you do it and you</b>
<b>knocked it out of the park</b>

15:46.000 --> 15:47.459
<b>and now I’m just-- I’m bombing.</b>

15:47.667 --> 15:48.918
<b>- No, it's like</b>
<b>you said, we're--</b>

15:49.000 --> 15:52.834
<b>We're not equals, so maybe</b>
<b>that's something that I can do</b>

15:52.918 --> 15:53.959
<b>that you can't.</b>

15:54.501 --> 15:55.542
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>I guess so.</b>

15:57.292 --> 15:58.959
<b>- So let me do it for you.</b>

16:00.250 --> 16:01.292
<b>- What?</b>

16:01.626 --> 16:02.667
<b>- Here, look at me.</b>

16:05.542 --> 16:06.584
<b>Okay, so...</b>

16:08.375 --> 16:09.417
<b>You have pretty eyes.</b>

16:11.000 --> 16:12.042
<b>And you have...</b>

16:13.667 --> 16:16.792
<b>Your hair is shiny</b>
<b>and bouncy and...</b>

16:17.292 --> 16:18.751
<b>- Well, it must be my shampoo.</b>

16:19.125 --> 16:20.584
<b>- I'm not done.</b>
<b>Look at me.</b>

16:26.209 --> 16:27.417
<b>You have a cute smile.</b>

16:28.876 --> 16:29.918
<b>And...</b>

16:31.542 --> 16:32.584
<b>You're smart.</b>

16:32.959 --> 16:34.000
<b>You're brave.</b>

16:35.334 --> 16:36.375
<b>You're kind.</b>

16:37.000 --> 16:38.042
<b>You listen.</b>

16:38.501 --> 16:39.709
<b>You put yourself out there.</b>

16:40.959 --> 16:42.000
<b>And...</b>

16:42.667 --> 16:43.709
<b>You're decent.</b>

16:45.626 --> 16:46.667
<b>You're humble.</b>

16:48.459 --> 16:49.501
<b>Honest.</b>

16:51.959 --> 16:53.000
<b>You're different.</b>

16:53.918 --> 16:54.959
<b>- Different?</b>

16:56.042 --> 16:57.083
<b>- Yeah, you're--</b>

<b>You're totally, utterly</b>

18:38.542 --> 18:40.542
<b>- What?</b>
<b>What did I do?</b>

18:40.709 --> 18:42.375
<b>- Make a comment and then</b>
<b>you don't stand behind it.</b>

18:42.459 --> 18:43.709
<b>And then--</b>
<b>And then you try and make me</b>

18:50.667 --> 18:51.709
<b>- What time is it?</b>

18:52.250 --> 18:53.292
<b>- It's around 7:00 almost.</b>

18:53.834 --> 18:55.083

18:55.167 --> 18:56.209
<b>(glasses clanking)</b>

18:57.375 --> 18:58.626
<b>- I’m not.</b>

18:58.709 --> 19:02.584
<b>He makes a comment about the</b>

19:02.667 --> 19:03.709
<b>nothing happened.</b>

19:04.792 --> 19:06.459
<b>- It's fine.</b>
<b>You got good wine, Pete.</b>

19:06.584 --> 19:07.792

19:08.209 --> 19:09.250

19:13.876 --> 19:14.918
<b>- Okay, fine.</b>

19:16.501 --> 19:18.876
<b>- The guy in the wine store said</b>
<b>that this was a good wine</b>

19:18.959 --> 19:20.209
<b>for the price,</b>

19:20.292 --> 19:22.417
<b>and that if you open it up</b>
<b>an hour before you eat,</b>

19:22.501 --> 19:24.250
<b>it gives it time to breathe</b>
<b>and for the aromatic--</b>

19:24.334 --> 19:27.167
<b>- Well, he's the wine guy, don't</b>
<b>ask me, I'm not the wine guy.</b>

19:27.250 --> 19:28.501
<b>- Well, why do you</b>
<b>take it upon yourself--</b>

19:28.584 --> 19:30.042
<b>- 'Cause you fucking</b>
<b>asked me, Pete.</b>

19:31.250 --> 19:32.709
<b>- Horace, where'd you</b>
<b>get these spices?</b>

<b>Grandma got some</b>

<b>Jesus Christ, Sylvia.</b>

<b>- I'm not living with</b>

19:49.375 --> 19:50.626
<b>It's morbid.</b>

19:50.709 --> 19:53.125
<b>When I die, you can get rid of</b>

19:56.375 --> 19:57.626
<b>(pot clanking)</b>

19:57.709 --> 19:58.959
<b>- I’m opening the wine.</b>

19:59.042 --> 20:00.292
<b>- Yeah, that's</b>
<b>a really good idea, Pete.</b>

20:00.834 --> 20:01.876
<b>- Fuck you.</b>

20:03.709 --> 20:04.751
<b>(Horace scoffs)</b>

<b>(Pete grunts)</b>

<b>- Hey, Sylvia, thanks for</b>
<b>cooking up a big dinner.</b>

20:12.876 --> 20:14.542
<b>- I'm not cooking up</b>
<b>a big dinner.</b>

20:14.834 --> 20:16.918
<b>I would have loved to cook a big</b>
<b>dinner, Pete, but you only told</b>

20:17.042 --> 20:18.709
<b>me about this a few hours ago.</b>

20:20.417 --> 20:22.834
<b>You know, I'm making pasta</b>
<b>and I got some meatballs already</b>

20:22.918 --> 20:23.959
<b>cooked from the deli.</b>

20:25.667 --> 20:26.709
<b>- Well, thanks for that.</b>

20:28.042 --> 20:29.083
<b>- Look at Chris Christie.</b>

20:30.000 --> 20:31.334
<b>Look at that face.</b>

20:31.417 --> 20:32.751
<b>(Pete coughs)</b>

20:32.876 --> 20:33.918
<b>God damn it.</b>

20:35.209 --> 20:36.250
<b>He's done.</b>

20:38.209 --> 20:39.834
<b>- I’m thinking, like, Trump</b>
<b>has something over him.</b>

20:40.167 --> 20:41.417
<b>- Right?</b>
<b>- Something, right?</b>

20:41.501 --> 20:42.751
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- It's gotta be.</b>

20:42.834 --> 20:44.417
<b>How does Trump--</b>
<b>I mean, no matter what he does,</b>

20:44.501 --> 20:45.709
<b>no matter what he says,</b>

20:46.501 --> 20:47.751
<b>he just keeps getting stronger.</b>

20:47.834 --> 20:48.876
<b>- No, it's--</b>

20:49.375 --> 20:50.626
<b>I think that the Republicans,</b>

20:50.709 --> 20:52.375
<b>that's why they</b>
<b>have to stop him.</b>

20:52.626 --> 20:53.876
<b>Like, they gotta forget</b>
<b>this election,</b>

20:55.000 --> 20:57.792
<b>stop Trump and then</b>
<b>that'll save them,</b>

20:57.876 --> 21:00.083
<b>because it's like, even if you</b>
<b>don't like them, you'd have to</b>

21:00.167 --> 21:02.042
<b>admire them for that.</b>
<b>- That's not the point, guys.</b>

21:02.125 --> 21:03.375
<b>It's guys.</b>

21:03.459 --> 21:04.501
<b>It's all guys.</b>

21:05.334 --> 21:06.709
<b>It's all about the boys,</b>
<b>you know?</b>

21:06.792 --> 21:08.709
<b>You think maybe</b>
<b>it's time for a woman.</b>

21:10.375 --> 21:12.042
<b>- You really think that</b>
<b>if Hillary was president,</b>

21:12.125 --> 21:13.375
<b>this would all be better?</b>

21:13.459 --> 21:14.709
<b>Like, she would do a better--</b>
<b>- I'm just saying, we've had--</b>

21:14.792 --> 21:17.209
<b>We've had 44 men</b>
<b>in a row in that job</b>

21:17.334 --> 21:18.584
<b>and the world is going to shit.</b>

21:18.667 --> 21:19.918
<b>So how about you</b>
<b>try a woman?</b>

21:20.000 --> 21:21.250
<b>You know, just to try it.</b>

21:21.334 --> 21:22.584
<b>- Just, any woman?</b>

21:22.667 --> 21:23.709
<b>- Yes, any woman.</b>

21:24.501 --> 21:25.542
<b>(knocking on door)</b>

21:26.542 --> 21:27.751
<b>All right, here we go.</b>

21:30.417 --> 21:31.459
<b>- Hey, guys?</b>

21:31.751 --> 21:32.959
<b>Can we just be, uh...</b>

21:34.000 --> 21:35.876
<b>Okay?</b>

21:36.542 --> 21:37.584

21:52.584 --> 21:54.584
<b>- Oh, this is my brother</b>
<b>and sister, this is Horace.</b>

21:54.667 --> 21:55.918
<b>- Nice to meet you.</b>

21:56.000 --> 21:57.709
<b>- Sylvia.</b>
<b>- Hi.</b>

21:57.792 --> 21:59.042
<b>- Hello.</b>

21:59.125 --> 22:00.584
<b>- Nice to, um...</b>
<b>- Come on in.</b>

22:01.125 --> 22:02.167
<b>- I brought wine.</b>

22:02.626 --> 22:03.667
<b>- Oh.</b>
<b>- Nothing fancy.</b>

22:04.709 --> 22:05.959
<b>- All right, 'cause I got--</b>

22:06.042 --> 22:07.918
<b>- Pete bought wine, honey,</b>
<b>and he's very anxious about it,</b>

22:08.000 --> 22:09.209
<b>so let's serve his wine.</b>

22:09.876 --> 22:11.125
<b>- That's okay.</b>

22:11.209 --> 22:12.542
<b>You don't have to open this now.</b>

22:12.626 --> 22:14.083
<b>You can have it another time.</b>

22:14.792 --> 22:17.209
<b>- Dinner will be ready</b>
<b>as soon as this water boils.</b>

22:17.876 --> 22:18.918
<b>- Okay, um, no hurry.</b>

22:25.375 --> 22:26.626
<b>- Um...</b>
<b>- Want to have a seat?</b>

22:26.709 --> 22:27.751
<b>- Sure.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

22:33.751 --> 22:35.501
<b>(pots clattering,</b>
<b>dishes clanking)</b>

22:35.918 --> 22:36.959
<b>- Oh, thank you.</b>

22:50.751 --> 22:51.959
<b>- So where are you from?</b>

22:52.375 --> 22:53.584
<b>- I grew up in Michigan.</b>

22:54.042 --> 22:55.083
<b>- Mm, what part?</b>

22:56.209 --> 22:58.292
<b>- Do you know Michigan?</b>
<b>- No.</b>

22:58.375 --> 22:59.417
<b>- Oh. It's--</b>

23:00.083 --> 23:02.667
<b>It's a really small town</b>
<b>called Engadine.</b>

23:03.667 --> 23:06.501
<b>- Sylvia, do you need to wash</b>
<b>the pots or so-- You wanna?</b>

23:09.501 --> 23:10.542
<b>- Yeah.</b>

23:16.542 --> 23:17.584
<b>- Hi.</b>
<b>- Hi there.</b>

23:18.626 --> 23:19.667
<b>- Nice to, uh...</b>

23:19.959 --> 23:21.000
<b>Pete: Mm.</b>

23:22.459 --> 23:23.501
<b>- ...meet you.</b>

23:25.000 --> 23:27.125
<b>- So, Michigan--</b>
<b>Engadine, Michigan?</b>

23:27.334 --> 23:28.375
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Uh-huh.</b>

23:29.709 --> 23:30.751
<b>- Yeah, Engadine is--</b>

23:31.834 --> 23:34.501
<b>It's in the U.P.</b>
<b>- Uh-huh.</b>

23:34.834 --> 23:36.751
<b>- What they call the upper</b>
<b>peninsula, in Michigan.</b>

23:38.876 --> 23:40.083
<b>- Is it cold up there?</b>

23:40.209 --> 23:41.667
<b>- In the winter, yeah.</b>
<b>Horace: Right.</b>

23:42.000 --> 23:43.250
<b>- Yeah, Jenny was telling me</b>

23:43.334 --> 23:46.083
<b>that when her dad died,</b>
<b>it was the winter,</b>

23:46.167 --> 23:48.083
<b>and they couldn't</b>
<b>bury him until the thaw.</b>

23:49.209 --> 23:50.459
<b>You know, the ground</b>
<b>was too hard.</b>

23:50.542 --> 23:51.584
<b>- Wow, that's...</b>
<b>Horace: Mhm.</b>

23:52.000 --> 23:53.250
<b>- That's...</b>

23:53.334 --> 23:54.584
<b>- Just saying, that's</b>
<b>how cold it is.</b>

23:54.667 --> 23:55.709
<b>- Yeah.</b>

23:56.167 --> 23:57.876
<b>(clearing throat)</b>

24:00.918 --> 24:01.959
<b>So, how'd you guys...</b>

24:03.292 --> 24:04.584
<b>How'd you end up</b>
<b>here from Michigan?</b>

24:04.667 --> 24:05.918
<b>How did you end up in--</b>

24:06.000 --> 24:07.459
<b>- I-- I went to</b>
<b>Brooklyn College.</b>

24:08.167 --> 24:09.417
<b>- Brooklyn College?</b>

24:09.501 --> 24:11.125
<b>I thought just New York kids</b>
<b>went there.</b>

24:11.209 --> 24:14.083
<b>- I really wanted to live</b>
<b>in New York, since I was little.</b>

24:15.167 --> 24:16.626
<b>Sylvia: Uh-huh.</b>
<b>- It was my dream.</b>

24:17.542 --> 24:19.292
<b>Brooklyn College was the only</b>
<b>school I could get into</b>

24:19.375 --> 24:20.417
<b>that I could afford.</b>

24:21.000 --> 24:22.667
<b>It's funny, I pictured</b>
<b>living in Manhattan,</b>

24:23.751 --> 24:25.918
<b>but I've only been to Manhattan</b>
<b>maybe three times</b>

24:26.459 --> 24:27.501
<b>since I got here.</b>

24:28.042 --> 24:29.292
<b>- And how long ago was that?</b>

24:29.375 --> 24:31.542
<b>That you got here?</b>
<b>That you were in college?</b>

24:31.709 --> 24:32.751
<b>- I’m-- I'm 26.</b>

24:33.667 --> 24:34.709
<b>- Got it.</b>

24:39.542 --> 24:41.000
<b>- So, uh...</b>
<b>- How'd you guys meet?</b>

24:42.542 --> 24:43.792
<b>- We met online,</b>
<b>I told you that.</b>

24:43.876 --> 24:44.918
<b>- Yes, you did.</b>

24:46.167 --> 24:47.417
<b>- Yeah.</b>

24:47.501 --> 24:48.959
<b>I know it's kinda lame, but...</b>

24:50.167 --> 24:52.334
<b>It's just not easy to meet</b>
<b>people these days.</b>

24:53.792 --> 24:56.292
<b>- I've also heard that online</b>
<b>relationships don't last,</b>

24:56.375 --> 24:58.292
<b>but Pete seems pretty darn</b>
<b>serious about you.</b>

24:58.709 --> 24:59.751
<b>- Sylvia.</b>

25:00.459 --> 25:01.501
<b>Come on, I--</b>

25:01.834 --> 25:03.292
<b>I didn't say we were serious.</b>

25:03.667 --> 25:04.709
<b>- It's okay.</b>

25:05.501 --> 25:06.542
<b>We are serious.</b>

25:07.792 --> 25:08.834
<b>I’m crazy about Pete.</b>

25:09.709 --> 25:10.959
<b>- That's nice.</b>
<b>- That's terrific.</b>

25:11.042 --> 25:12.083
<b>- Yeah.</b>

25:16.375 --> 25:18.417
<b>- I’m gonna pour some wine.</b>

25:22.959 --> 25:24.250
<b>(wine bottle clanking)</b>

25:24.876 --> 25:25.918
<b>- Is everything okay?</b>

25:26.417 --> 25:28.250
<b>I’m-- I’m sensing that</b>
<b>there's something--</b>

25:28.334 --> 25:29.542
<b>- No, no, it's all right.</b>

25:29.751 --> 25:32.000
<b>- No, you're--</b>
<b>Pete's new girl, you know.</b>

25:32.459 --> 25:35.083
<b>Since you guys are so serious,</b>
<b>we're getting to know you.</b>

25:36.501 --> 25:37.542
<b>- Well, I appreciate that.</b>

25:39.834 --> 25:43.167
<b>Maybe you could consider</b>
<b>that I'm pretty nervous and,</b>

25:44.125 --> 25:47.918
<b>so you're not really seeing me</b>
<b>as I am right now, because...</b>

25:49.000 --> 25:50.042
<b>Well, this is weird.</b>

25:50.751 --> 25:52.626
<b>- What's weird about it?</b>
<b>That you're half his age?</b>

25:52.709 --> 25:53.751
<b>- Sylvie.</b>
<b>- Come on.</b>

25:54.584 --> 25:56.417
<b>Sylvia, stop.</b>
<b>That's-- You're being mean.</b>

25:56.667 --> 25:58.876
<b>- I am?</b>
<b>- Yeah, pretty fucking mean.</b>

26:00.000 --> 26:01.042
<b>- Uh, the pasta.</b>

26:01.375 --> 26:02.417
<b>- Oh, yeah.</b>

26:06.375 --> 26:07.584
<b>- Can we--</b>
<b>Should we sit?</b>

26:10.083 --> 26:11.834
<b>(pot clanking)</b>

26:14.959 --> 26:16.626
<b>- Listen, don't--</b>

26:16.709 --> 26:18.417
<b>Don't worry about it.</b>
<b>Don't worry about it.</b>

26:18.542 --> 26:19.792
<b>- Worry about what?</b>
<b>We're fine.</b>

26:19.876 --> 26:22.167
<b>- Nothing, nothing, it's okay.</b>

26:28.626 --> 26:30.542
<b>Should I sit down?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

26:35.667 --> 26:36.709
<b>(Horace exhaling)</b>

26:39.083 --> 26:40.125
<b>Here you go.</b>
<b>- Thanks.</b>

26:43.000 --> 26:44.042
<b>- Thank you.</b>

26:52.209 --> 26:53.459
<b>- Ah, coming through.</b>

26:53.709 --> 26:54.751
<b>(Jenny giggles)</b>

27:16.250 --> 27:17.292
<b>- This looks good.</b>

27:20.751 --> 27:21.792
<b>(silverware clanking)</b>

27:24.834 --> 27:26.083
<b>(clearing throat)</b>

27:26.167 --> 27:27.709
<b>(bowl sliding)</b>

27:30.167 --> 27:31.209
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

27:34.083 --> 27:35.125
<b>- Thank you.</b>

27:39.501 --> 27:40.542
<b>- You want some cheese?</b>

27:40.876 --> 27:41.918
<b>- Please.</b>

27:43.000 --> 27:44.042
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>Sylvia: Mm-hm.</b>

27:44.459 --> 27:45.501
<b>(plate clanks)</b>

28:00.375 --> 28:01.417
<b>- Oh, excuse me.</b>

28:02.542 --> 28:03.584
<b>Um...</b>

28:04.542 --> 28:06.709
<b>Jenny's a Baptist, so she's</b>
<b>accustomed to saying grace.</b>

28:07.417 --> 28:08.667
<b>- Really?</b>

28:08.751 --> 28:09.792
<b>- It's okay, we really--</b>

28:10.125 --> 28:11.542
<b>We don't have to.</b>
<b>- Yeah, we don't--</b>

28:11.626 --> 28:12.834
<b>We don't say grace here.</b>

28:13.918 --> 28:15.751
<b>- Well, it wouldn't</b>
<b>kill us to say grace.</b>

28:15.834 --> 28:16.876
<b>I mean...</b>

28:18.083 --> 28:20.959
<b>I mean, you know, if someone who</b>
<b>is present who says grace,</b>

28:21.709 --> 28:22.959
<b>especially if they're a guest,</b>

28:23.042 --> 28:24.959
<b>I think we could</b>
<b>do her the honor.</b>

28:25.083 --> 28:26.125
<b>- That's--</b>

28:26.959 --> 28:28.000
<b>That's fine with me.</b>

28:31.584 --> 28:32.834
<b>- I feel funny.</b>

28:32.918 --> 28:35.542
<b>- No, go ahead, by all means,</b>
<b>say grace at our table.</b>

28:36.501 --> 28:37.751
<b>- Go ahead.</b>
<b>Go ahead, Jenny.</b>

28:37.834 --> 28:39.501
<b>- Pete, don't--</b>
<b>- Don't make her do it.</b>

28:42.876 --> 28:45.042
<b>- Why don't you say it?</b>
<b>You should say it, Pete.</b>

28:46.042 --> 28:47.083
<b>- All right. (clearing throat)</b>

28:50.501 --> 28:53.834
<b>Um, thank you God for this meal.</b>

28:55.083 --> 28:56.292
<b>Thank you for our food.</b>

28:58.125 --> 29:01.167
<b>And... thank you</b>
<b>for bringing us Jenny, um...</b>

29:03.626 --> 29:05.083
<b>to share this meal with us.</b>

29:06.834 --> 29:09.626
<b>And thank you, um...</b>

29:10.626 --> 29:11.667
<b>For our blessings.</b>

29:12.667 --> 29:13.918
<b>Thanks for our brother</b>
<b>and sister.</b>

29:14.000 --> 29:15.918
<b>- You fuck.</b>
<b>You're gonna lie to God now?</b>

29:16.209 --> 29:18.250
<b>- Sylvia.</b>
<b>- Well?</b>

29:18.334 --> 29:19.375
<b>- What?</b>

29:21.125 --> 29:22.167
<b>- He's not our brother.</b>

29:22.584 --> 29:24.876
<b>Horace and I are brother</b>
<b>and sister, Pete's our cousin.</b>

29:24.959 --> 29:26.167
<b>- Oh.</b>
<b>- It's not that simple.</b>

29:26.584 --> 29:28.709
<b>Sylvia: Well...</b>
<b>- We-- We grew up as siblings,</b>

29:29.334 --> 29:30.584
<b>in our childhood and then</b>
<b>we found out late--</b>

29:30.667 --> 29:33.876
<b>- Okay, do you mind</b>
<b>if I tell my life?</b>

29:35.125 --> 29:37.542
<b>At my own choice?</b>
<b>- You brought her here, Pete.</b>

29:37.626 --> 29:39.083
<b>What?</b>
<b>Did you want us to lie, too?</b>

29:39.167 --> 29:40.375
<b>- It's not a lie. I--</b>

29:42.417 --> 29:44.834
<b>What the fuck</b>
<b>do you care what I tell her?</b>

29:45.751 --> 29:48.042
<b>- I’m just saying, you bring</b>
<b>somebody home,</b>

29:48.834 --> 29:51.250
<b>you know, and you want us all to</b>
<b>be family with her or whatever</b>

29:51.334 --> 29:53.751
<b>your fantasy is, you think you'd</b>
<b>tell her the truth.</b>

29:54.250 --> 29:56.417
<b>And yes, Jenny,</b>
<b>I have cancer, by the way.</b>

29:56.792 --> 29:58.083
<b>- Oh, I’m sorry.</b>

29:58.167 --> 29:59.417
<b>- I mean, Pete, I saw</b>
<b>the look on her face.</b>

29:59.501 --> 30:01.417
<b>You could have done the poor</b>
<b>girl a favor, you know, when you</b>

30:01.501 --> 30:03.209
<b>invited her, you could have</b>
<b>said, oh, by the way,</b>

30:03.292 --> 30:04.542
<b>my sister-- my cousin,</b>

30:04.876 --> 30:07.459
<b>has cancer, so she</b>
<b>didn't have to look horrified</b>

30:07.542 --> 30:08.792
<b>when she walked in the door.</b>

30:08.876 --> 30:09.918
<b>- I wasn't horrified.</b>

30:10.292 --> 30:11.334
<b>- Okay, Jenny?</b>

30:13.501 --> 30:18.083
<b>This is my cousin,</b>
<b>Sylvia and my cousin, Horace.</b>

30:19.626 --> 30:20.667
<b>And Sylvia has cancer.</b>

30:22.375 --> 30:26.626
<b>And we used to be brother</b>
<b>and sister, until the man</b>

30:26.709 --> 30:28.083
<b>who I thought was my uncle</b>

30:28.167 --> 30:30.542
<b>dropped the news</b>
<b>that he was my father,</b>

30:31.584 --> 30:32.792
<b>and then he shot himself.</b>

30:34.751 --> 30:35.792
<b>Okay?</b>
<b>Is that enough?</b>

30:36.542 --> 30:38.209
<b>Is that honest enough for you,</b>
<b>Sylvia?</b>

30:38.876 --> 30:40.125
<b>Because apparently,</b>

30:40.209 --> 30:43.584
<b>I have to ask <i><b>you</i> what</b></b>
<b>I can tell or not tell</b>

30:43.667 --> 30:45.125
<b>the girl I’m in love with?</b>

30:47.000 --> 30:48.042
<b>- Pete.</b>
<b>- Well, actually, I--</b>

30:48.709 --> 30:50.000
<b>I do think there is more</b>
<b>you could tell her.</b>

30:50.083 --> 30:51.334
<b>Horace: No, don't. Don't.</b>

30:51.417 --> 30:52.667
<b>- What? I just think if they're</b>
<b>in love,</b>

30:52.792 --> 30:54.042
<b>she has</b>
<b>a right to know.</b>

30:54.125 --> 30:55.375
<b>- Maybe don't tell me.</b>

30:55.459 --> 30:56.501
<b>Horace: Don't say it.</b>

30:57.042 --> 30:58.083
<b>Sylvia, don't say it.</b>

30:59.334 --> 31:00.584
<b>- All right, never mind.</b>

31:00.667 --> 31:01.709
<b>Horace: Just...</b>
<b>- Never mind!</b>

31:03.042 --> 31:04.083
<b>Sorry, Jenny.</b>

31:04.417 --> 31:05.459
<b>- It's okay.</b>

31:06.876 --> 31:07.918
<b>Kind of.</b>

31:12.834 --> 31:14.918
<b>- No, really, I'm--</b>
<b>I'm very sorry.</b>

31:15.959 --> 31:18.125
<b>I truly do apologize.</b>
<b>You must be in hell.</b>

31:18.792 --> 31:20.042
<b>You seem like</b>
<b>a very nice person</b>

31:20.125 --> 31:22.626
<b>and this has absolutely nothing</b>
<b>to do with you.</b>

31:22.918 --> 31:24.209
<b>- It's really-- It's okay,</b>
<b>whenever you go</b>

31:24.459 --> 31:26.375
<b>to meet a guy's family,</b>
<b>it's always...</b>

31:26.459 --> 31:27.834
<b>- It's just that when you get to</b>
<b>be older, you're gonna see guys</b>

31:28.000 --> 31:29.501
<b>his age with a girl your age,</b>

31:29.584 --> 31:31.250
<b>it's gonna make</b>
<b>you want to puke.</b>

31:31.626 --> 31:33.542
<b>Of course, it doesn't now,</b>
<b>but it will.</b>

31:34.709 --> 31:35.751
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

31:36.375 --> 31:37.417
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

31:38.042 --> 31:40.918
<b>- Is there any way at all we</b>
<b>could talk about something else?</b>

31:41.292 --> 31:43.375
<b>Pete: Yes. Please.</b>

31:46.918 --> 31:47.959
<b>- Well, let's see.</b>

31:48.292 --> 31:49.542
<b>Before you got here,</b>

31:49.626 --> 31:52.167
<b>the boys and I were discussing</b>
<b>Hillary Clinton.</b>

31:52.292 --> 31:54.834
<b>I was just saying that</b>
<b>after all the war and graft,</b>

31:54.918 --> 31:57.542
<b>I thought maybe it was time to</b>

31:57.626 --> 31:58.876
<b>What do you think?</b>

31:58.959 --> 32:00.000
<b>- I, um...</b>

32:00.626 --> 32:02.459
<b>I like it better when</b>
<b>a man is president.</b>

32:05.918 --> 32:09.375
<b>- Pete is a heavily</b>
<b>medicated outpatient...</b>

32:10.209 --> 32:11.459
<b>of a mental hospital.</b>

32:13.584 --> 32:15.876
<b>- What?</b>
<b>- Horace.</b>

32:16.375 --> 32:18.751
<b>- He takes something</b>
<b>called Probitol.</b>

32:19.250 --> 32:20.918
<b>If he doesn't take it, he has--</b>

32:22.459 --> 32:24.751
<b>He thinks there's snakes</b>
<b>and monsters everywhere.</b>

32:24.876 --> 32:25.918
<b>He starts screaming.</b>

32:26.542 --> 32:27.584
<b>- Wait.</b>

32:28.083 --> 32:29.125
<b>Pete...</b>

32:29.751 --> 32:30.959
<b>- Why'd you just say that?</b>

32:31.792 --> 32:32.834
<b>- Well...</b>

32:36.751 --> 32:37.792
<b>- Pete, is that true?</b>

32:40.209 --> 32:41.250
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>Jesus.</b>

32:42.167 --> 32:43.209
<b>Uh...</b>

32:43.834 --> 32:46.250
<b>Yeah, he had a psychotic</b>
<b>breakdown when he was 16.</b>

32:47.667 --> 32:50.292
<b>He was committed to a mental</b>
<b>hospital when he was 25</b>

32:50.417 --> 32:52.792
<b>and lived there on and off</b>

32:53.334 --> 32:58.083
<b>and 'til they invented</b>
<b>Probitol, thank God,</b>

32:58.375 --> 33:00.751
<b>depending on who you ask,</b>
<b>and now he is, you know,</b>

33:00.834 --> 33:02.083
<b>a stable enough man,</b>

33:02.167 --> 33:03.834
<b>he lives in</b>
<b>a little room downstairs,</b>

33:04.083 --> 33:05.125
<b>pushes the broom around,</b>

33:05.792 --> 33:07.709
<b>unless the drug</b>
<b>has him in a stupor.</b>

33:08.334 --> 33:09.375
<b>That's Pete.</b>

33:09.918 --> 33:11.542
<b>Jenny, this is Pete.</b>
<b>Meet Pete.</b>

33:13.459 --> 33:14.918
<b>You ready to take that on?</b>

33:15.292 --> 33:16.334
<b>All of 26?</b>

33:17.792 --> 33:20.417
<b>You ready to handle that and all</b>
<b>that that comes with?</b>

33:20.792 --> 33:22.375
<b>'Til you see him</b>
<b>into his old age</b>

33:22.459 --> 33:23.918
<b>in all of, like, 20 years</b>
<b>from now?</b>

33:29.083 --> 33:30.334
<b>- Fuck.</b>

33:30.417 --> 33:32.000
<b>- What? Come on.</b>
<b>What, it's fine.</b>

33:32.083 --> 33:34.000
<b>We are a family.</b>
<b>Everybody eat your pasta.</b>

33:40.250 --> 33:42.083
<b>- I... I better go.</b>

33:47.334 --> 33:48.375
<b>For the record,</b>

33:49.834 --> 33:51.042
<b>I don't know you guys.</b>

33:52.334 --> 33:53.375
<b>But that was mean,</b>

33:54.709 --> 33:56.375
<b>the way you</b>
<b>just told me that.</b>

33:58.667 --> 34:02.083
<b>And I don't care if he's your</b>
<b>brother or your cousin.</b>

34:02.250 --> 34:04.834
<b>I wouldn't treat a dog the way</b>
<b>you just treated Pete.</b>

34:04.918 --> 34:05.959
<b>I'm sorry.</b>
<b>No, that's--</b>

34:07.292 --> 34:10.542
<b>That's rude to say, but, you</b>
<b>don't seem exactly concerned</b>

34:10.667 --> 34:12.333
<b>with how you talk to me, so...</b>

34:15.708 --> 34:16.751
<b>I’m gonna go.</b>

34:17.501 --> 34:18.542

<b>You could have done the poor</b>

<b>my sister-- my cousin,</b>

30:07.542 --> 30:08.792
<b>when she walked in the door.</b>

30:08.876 --> 30:09.918
<b>- I wasn't horrified.</b>

30:10.292 --> 30:11.334
<b>- Okay, Jenny?</b>

30:13.501 --> 30:18.083
<b>This is my cousin,</b>

30:19.626 --> 30:20.667
<b>And Sylvia has cancer.</b>

30:22.375 --> 30:26.626

30:26.709 --> 30:28.083

30:28.167 --> 30:30.542
<b>dropped the news</b>

30:38.876 --> 30:40.125

30:57.042 --> 30:58.083
