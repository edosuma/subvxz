No one was worried
that he’d disappeared?

11:59.011 --> 12:03.380
Bill and I had
a small disagreement
Friday night.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.510
He wanted to go visit
his kid in college, but
we had a shoot scheduled

12:06.643 --> 12:08.383
Promos.
Anyone else hear
this argument?

12:08.478 --> 12:12.062
No. It was personal
We walked away
from the crew

12:12.149 --> 12:16.643
[Clears Throat]
Actually, it was, uh—
it was pretty loud Mr. Lang.

12:20.032 --> 12:21.738
Mr. O’ Rourke
threatened to quit.

12:23.952 --> 12:27.285
He wasjust blowing off steam.
That’s why I wasn’t worried.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.624
Figured he’djust
gone offwith Amanda
to see the kid.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.244
This is a popular show.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.371
It’s probably worth
millions ofdollars.
Am I right?

12:33.503 --> 12:35.243
Why do you ask?
[Booth]
Well, money like that,

12:35.339 --> 12:38.081
you must insure your star
for quite a bit.

12:38.175 --> 12:40.257
Of course.
But I think you’re
taking this all wrong.

12:40.344 --> 12:44.178
Bill and I were best friends.
We played tennis together
all the time. We—

12:44.264 --> 12:46.300
Ifhe quit,
you’d lose everything.

12:46.391 --> 12:50.976
And if he was found dead,
you’d end up
with a nice payout.

12:51.063 --> 12:54.681
Hmm. Wouldn’tyou?

12:57.569 --> 13:01.153
Why don’t you
get Agent Booth
everything he needs, Pete.

13:01.239 --> 13:04.322
/ believe /should
call my attorney.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.823
Arthur Lang will only talk
through his attorney,

13:12.918 --> 13:15.159
who says he was
in Atlantic City
all weekend playing keno.

13:15.253 --> 13:18.416
- We’re checking out his story.
- He could’ve hired a hit man.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.839
This was not a contractjob.
This was personal and violent.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.133
Sweets is on his way up
with the show tapes...

13:23.220 --> 13:25.552
to profile
for a revenge killer.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.970
Okay. See you later.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.513
Bones, wait a second.
Where you going?

13:28.600 --> 13:30.556
I thought maybe we could,
you know, help out Sweets.

13:30.686 --> 13:33.098
To a film.
This is much better
than a movie.

13:33.188 --> 13:36.476
The hours of fascinating video.
Hey, great stories
for the deep—sea welder.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.852
Actually, I’m going to the film
with a botanist.

13:38.944 --> 13:41.230
Ah. I get it.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.313
You dumped Mark.
That’s too bad.
I kind of liked the guy.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.612
No, I didn’t dump Mark.
I’m seeing both ofthem.
The same time?

13:47.703 --> 13:49.694
Mark and I have
a physical connection.

13:49.788 --> 13:52.370
The botanist,
while brilliant and fascinating,

13:52.457 --> 13:55.244
just—just doesn’t
appeal to me in that way.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.702
So all that stuffyou said
about monogamy being unnatural,
you’rejust making excuses.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.789
I do not make excuses.
Only people who are ashamed
make excuses.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.874
Bones, two guys
at the same time.

14:03.969 --> 14:06.460
It’s not right.
That’s why they
invented dueling.

14:06.555 --> 14:10.013
- How can you say—
- Hey. You guys ready?

14:10.100 --> 14:14.969
- I know what I’m doing, Booth.
- My gut says you’re going
with your gut on this one.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.270
And we all know
how that ends up—
not good

14:17.357 --> 14:20.190
Is there something
we need to discuss
before gett/ng to work?

14:20.277 --> 14:22.313
- No. No.
- [Pushing Elevator Button]

14:22.404 --> 14:25.316
Just call me when you
find something ofvalue.
[Punches Elevator Button]

14:29.619 --> 14:32.861
No. It’s nothing.
It’sjust she’s got a date.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.368
Oh. And how do you
feel about that?

14:35.459 --> 14:37.450
It’s not about me.
Let’s go look
at those videos.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.206
Do you have any idea
how good it smells in here?

14:40.297 --> 14:43.881
It’s “eau de formaldehyde.”
Glad you like it.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.629
There are hairline fractures
at the base ofthe skull,

14:46.720 --> 14:49.336
probably made when the photo
wasjammed down his throat.

14:49.473 --> 14:52.715
Dr. Hodgins should probably
pull some particulates.
Very good.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.186
My boyfriend thinks it’s weird
that I love doing this,

14:55.270 --> 14:57.306
but I think it’s weird
that he loves the accordion.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.183
I’m with you there.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.765
Dr. Brennan is my hero.
Always has been.

15:01.860 --> 15:05.227
Ijust hope she loves m—
she likes me.

15:05.322 --> 15:09.486
Well, bonjour.
Antemortem fractures
to the lumbar vertebrae.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.950
Maybe two weeks old?
Try to find
what caused it.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.277
On it.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.657
Dr. Brennan and I are,
like, the same. You know?

15:15.749 --> 15:18.616
We understand that the dead
don’t talk back...

15:18.710 --> 15:21.122
or want the window open
when it’s freezing out...

15:21.213 --> 15:23.420
or pick at your plate
or pee on the toilet seat.

15:23.507 --> 15:27.671
You might wanna keep
a little mystery about yourself.

15:27.761 --> 15:31.094
Sure. But you’re gonna
put in a good word
for me, right?

15:31.181 --> 15:33.763
Wouldn’t it be fun
if I were here forever?

15:33.850 --> 15:35.636
Yeah.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.513
Fresh abrasions.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.016
Can you hand me a swab?

15:40.107 --> 15:43.270
I managed to get
some usable pieces
ofthat photo.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.852
-Just fragments, but it’s a start.
-OMy

15:46.947 --> 15:49.404
/ used an infrared camera,
and/ excluded
all the vis/b/e l/ght.

15:51.368 --> 15:56.032
IfI had to take a guess,
I’d say the mystery couple
were knocking boots.

15:56.123 --> 16:00.332
[Laughs]
I always love
your clinical assessments.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.410
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry,
but nothing was
gonna happen.

16:03.505 --> 16:06.497
Nothing was gonna happen?
You’re in your under— N0.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.582
Oh, God
Please don ’t Ciy.
Don ’t 03/?

16:08.677 --> 16:11.089
You’re in your
underwear with—
Don ’t Ciy. Don ’t 03/.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.803
Nothing was
gonna happen.
What’d I miss?

16:13.890 --> 16:17.098
Six men crying—
two insisting they’d gotten lost...

16:17.185 --> 16:19.642
and four saying
they were trying to show
the poor young women...

16:19.729 --> 16:21.765
how dangerous
the Internet could be.

16:21.898 --> 16:25.311
A parade of saints, huh?
The murder was premeditated
and filled with rage,

16:25.402 --> 16:27.484
not the act of someone
apologetic or ashamed.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.311
Did you find any rage?

16:29.406 --> 16:32.864
I know you don’t have
the benefit ofyears
of psychological training,

16:32.951 --> 16:35.112
but, uh, check
out oneJim Dodd.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.534
[Tape Fast—forwarding]

16:37.873 --> 16:40.080
Come on, baby.
I can’t wait.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.954
You bastard!
You’re never gonna
see this child ever.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.293
Do you hear me? Ever.
I’m Bill O’Rourke,
and,Jim Dodd,

16:45.422 --> 16:47.378
you’ve been
busted by Bill.
[Woman ] Oh, God!

16:47.507 --> 16:50.590
Oh, God!
Stop it! Stop!
I’m gonna kill you!

16:50.677 --> 16:53.214
- Wow.
- [ Woman]
Come on. Stop!

16:53.346 --> 16:56.804
Serious impulse control
issues.
Very good, Agent Booth.

16:56.892 --> 16:59.599
I’ve marked a few
other possible suspects
that match the profile,

16:59.686 --> 17:03.850
but I think Dodd exhibits
the right amount of rage
and self-justifying vengeance.

17:03.940 --> 17:07.023
So Dodd’s our guy.
Let’s go tell Bones, huh?
Come on.

17:07.110 --> 17:09.476
Hmm? What?
Uh, couldn’t wejust call?

17:09.571 --> 17:11.436
No. Let’s go.

Open City m/ght be

17:13.617 --> 17:15.608

No sets, no—

17:15.702 --> 17:19.411
1945. The country had barely
starting rebuilding after the war.

17:19.497 --> 17:22.364
Yes. Of course
I’m also a big fan
of Meatballs,

Hey,Bones

17:27.631 --> 17:30.213
H/I Special A gent Booth,
her pan‘ner.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.918
- Hi.
- I’m Dr. Lance Sweets.
I’m theirtherapist.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.010
Jason DeFry.
[Booth]
DeF/y.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.175
Do you follow them around
all the time?
[Sweets]No.

17:38.266 --> 17:42.100
No, no, no.
I’m also a profiler.
I help with the cases.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.893
Did you know
that she was on a date?
It slipped my mind.

17:46.983 --> 17:50.692
- Spiffy suit, man.
- Thanks. Picked it up in Italy.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.986
- A little tight, huh?
- It’s the style.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.155
- Ever been married?
- No.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.949
- Have a kid?
- Never been married, remember?

17:58.036 --> 18:00.118
- I have a kid.
- He’s never been married.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.622
I should get to work,Jason.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.870
We’ve got a murderer to catch.
You understand?

18:06.962 --> 18:09.294
Yeah. Of course. Of course.
It’s getting late anyway.

18:09.381 --> 18:12.043
Listen. I have
Coldplay tickets
for tomorrow night.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.966
/ thought maybe we’d
grab a bite first.
Any interest?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.802
Absolutely. I might have
to leave from work.
No problem.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.217
I’ll meet you
at your office at 6:00.
I’ll be there.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.890
Nice meeting you all.
[Sweets]
Yeah.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.391
No wonder you two
are platonic.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.817
What is that
supposed to mean?
I’m ﬁne with it. Really.

18:32.904 --> 18:35.771
/ ha ve zero problems
with it, but—

18:35.865 --> 18:38.572
- That guy’s gay.
- He is not gay.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.616
Please. Double-cheek kiss.
Tight Italian suit.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.069
- Coldplay.
- Never married.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.290
- Coldplay.
-Jason is as heterosexual
as either ofyou.

18:44.374 --> 18:47.332
Then how is it that he’s
okay with not having sex?

18:47.419 --> 18:51.958
- What?
- Uh, we share
an intellectual bond.

18:52.048 --> 18:55.506
I don’t have
physical feelings for him.
He understands that.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.801
Not if he’s straight.
Right? Am I right?

18:58.888 --> 19:00.628
You are hot.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.680
You’re here fora reason?

19:05.770 --> 19:08.933
Um, we got something
off the DVDs.

19:09.024 --> 19:11.561
Mint tea.
Fruit tarts?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.687
Speak, Sweets, please.
Okay, okay.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.645
Um, most ofthe cheaters
were essentially cowards,

19:16.740 --> 19:19.026
seeking alternate
sexual exper/ences,

19:19.117 --> 19:21.733
because they’re too afraid
to confront the problems
in their own lives.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.319
Just because someone seeks
an alternative sexual outlet...

19:24.414 --> 19:26.496
doesn’t mean
that they’re a coward.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.949
- She has issues.
- I do not have issues.

19:29.044 --> 19:31.080
Case in point—
deep-sea welder
and a botanist.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.412
What, did they go into a bar?

19:33.506 --> 19:36.543
Huh? What? No.
Brennan’s two boyfriends.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.340
Oh. Right.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.714
Let me guess.
That one’s a botanist?

19:41.765 --> 19:43.756
-Yeah.
- [ Chuckling]

19:43.850 --> 19:45.761
- So you have nothing?
- Show her.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.011
- This isJim Dodd.
- I’m gonna kill you!

19:49.105 --> 19:50.720
The photograph you pulled
out ofO’Rourke ’s throat—

19:50.815 --> 19:54.899
turns out thatJim Dodd
used to be a mall photographer
at Tiny Tots Photography.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.522
Motive and means.

19:56.613 --> 19:59.150
Yeah. His landlord
said he disappeared
five days ago.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.903
- No forwarding address.
- You think he left because he
was planning to kill O’Rourke?

20:02.994 --> 20:04.530
Yeah. It fits. Okay?

20:04.621 --> 20:08.113
Landlord also said
he has a drinking buddy
by the name ofChris Gutman.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.119
We’re looking for him.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.873
This couldn’t have waited
till after I say good night toJason?

20:13.963 --> 20:15.919
I’mjust looking out
for you, all right?

20:16.007 --> 20:18.794
You don’t have the, uh,
best taste in men.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.007
[Brennan]
So you ’re going to hire
a stalker to ﬁnd Dodd?

20:27.102 --> 20:28.433
[Booth]
Perfect underco ver mo ve.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.018
You think this is a good idea?
Of course I do.
It’s mine.

20:31.106 --> 20:33.939
Gutman was lying
through his teeth.
There he is, right over there.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.641
This way, we’ll
be able to find out
what he really knows.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.227
Yo. Namaste, guys.
Hi, Noel.

20:39.364 --> 20:43.107
Think they have mung beans?
I’m on an ayurvedic cleanse.
What?

20:43.201 --> 20:45.817
I do mung beans till Sunday.
Then I start the enemas.

20:45.912 --> 20:50.030
Listen, Noel,
we’d like to harness you
for your natural abilities.

20:50.166 --> 20:53.078
You want your chart done.
No.

20:53.169 --> 20:56.457
Stalking.
You like to stalk people.

20:56.548 --> 20:58.584
Observe them.

20:58.675 --> 21:01.417
Hey, Noel.
Eyes over here. Okay?

21:01.511 --> 21:04.048
Eyes on him, not her.
Him. Noel.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.470
Chris Gutman.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.767
So not my type.
It’s not recreational.

21:10.854 --> 21:13.596
I wanna find out
where he goes, who he sees,
who he talks to.

21:13.690 --> 21:16.102
He hangs out with a guy
by the name ofJim Dodd.

21:16.234 --> 21:18.395
You want me
to write that down?
No. I got it.

21:18.528 --> 21:20.610
What’s his name?
Jim Dodd.

21:20.697 --> 21:23.609
Jim Dodd.
I want details.
I’ll give you 50 bucks.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.867
Sure, but I got
to be done by Sunday,
because I got this—

21:27.996 --> 21:31.204
Right. The enemas.
“Nomaste.”
Namaste.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.833
Everything you
never wanted to drain
from outhouse sludge.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.753
Two toy cars,
three cell phones,

21:38.840 --> 21:41.957
a doorknob,
uh, rubber casing,

21:42.051 --> 21:44.383
a plastic
Easter bunny head and—

21:44.471 --> 21:45.802
Drumroll.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.091
Optional.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.720
One slightly used
.40-caliber bullet.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.973
Excellent. If Booth can find
the murder weapon,
we can match it.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.054
We may not have
to wait that long

21:56.149 --> 21:59.266
I took some initiative
and checked out the lumbar
fractures I found on O’Rourke,

21:59.360 --> 22:01.066
figuring he’d have
to be treated for them.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.236
He was treated
at Providence Hospital.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.814
The police brought him in.
The wife ofa guy he busted...

22:05.909 --> 22:08.776
rammed Bill
with her grocery cart
at Food King.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.952
You did this
without my approval?

22:13.374 --> 22:16.741
And why shouldn’t
I toss you out of here right now?

22:16.836 --> 22:21.455
Dr. Brennan always says,
in an intellectual pursuit,
there are no limits.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.585
Well, in fact, there are.

22:23.676 --> 22:27.009
Produce section road rage
is a long way
from shoot/ng a man dead

22:27.096 --> 22:29.758
Not ifyou’re a police officer
who carries a gun...

22:29.849 --> 22:32.966
the same caliber as the bullet
you found in the poop pit.

22:35.480 --> 22:39.223
Capitol Police Sergeant
Francis Diamond.

22:41.361 --> 22:44.228
Doesn’t it feel as if
I’ve always been here?

22:52.121 --> 22:54.373
I hate Bill O’Rourke.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.948
He tried
to destroy my marriage,
but I didn’t kill him.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.501
You don ’t think your husband
cheating might have put
a wrinkle In the relationsh/p?

23:00.588 --> 23:02.795
What my husband did
was not cheating.

23:02.882 --> 23:06.795
See, Booth, this is a woman
enlightened enough not to expect
a monogamous relationship.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.171
He’d never cheat on me.

23:08.263 --> 23:11.130
Then why turn your husband in
to the Busted by Bill show?

23:11.224 --> 23:14.716
I didn’t. It was my sister.
She called up their tip line.

23:14.811 --> 23:17.769
Kept insisting that
he was messing around,
but it wasn’t true.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.393
Sergeant Diamond,
we saw the video.

23:21.484 --> 23:25.147
Your husband
met the young woman
at the motel with ﬂowers.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.945
And then took oﬁ‘ his pants.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.944
He went there to warn her
it could be dangerous
meeting someone online.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.991
Perhaps she’s not
so enlightened.

23:33.079 --> 23:36.116
Ballistics is gonna need
to see the sidearm.

23:38.334 --> 23:39.949

what / found lodged In
B/l/ O’Rourke ’5 lower Intest/ne.

23:55.393 --> 23:58.931
I can’t understand
why Booth has an issue
with me seeing two men.

23:59.022 --> 24:02.606
Ah. Guys like to think they’re
the only ones who should sleep
with more than one person.

24:02.692 --> 24:04.648
They like
to be in control.

24:04.736 --> 24:06.977
Doesn’t take a lot
to throw the little
darlings off their game.

24:07.071 --> 24:10.108
Oh, yeah, and then you end up
lying in bed holding them...

24:10.199 --> 24:13.236
while they say, “I don’t know
what’s wrong. This has never
happened to me before.”

24:13.328 --> 24:16.070
[Brennan]
He should be happy
that / found a way to satisﬁ/ myself

24:16.205 --> 24:18.992
Itjust happens
to require two men.
/’ve done that.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.493
I miss college.

24:20.585 --> 24:23.918
And the botanist?
No biological imperative?

24:24.005 --> 24:26.121
He’s flirted with the intent
to become intimate,

24:26.215 --> 24:28.831
but Mark keeps me
quite sated sexually.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.791
You really got to learn
some girl talk, sweetie.

24:30.887 --> 24:34.300

24:57.080 --> 25:00.117

Oh, of course.

I’m the same way.
We’re two of a kind.

25:02.752 --> 25:04.913
You’re like
a hero to me.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.667
Hero-worship exposes
a lack ofindependent
intellectual examination.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.749
I’ll tell Booth
what we found.

25:12.512 --> 25:15.094
She’s so smart.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.421
Yeah.

25:16.516 --> 25:17.756
[Sighs]

25:20.269 --> 25:22.681
So Sergeant Diamond’s
firearm wasn’t a match.

25:22.772 --> 25:24.763
She wasn’t even in town
Friday and Monday.

25:24.857 --> 25:28.441
She was with her husband,
fixing her marriage
at some tantric sex workshop.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.519
Well, I’ve heard that,
if practiced correctly,

25:30.613 --> 25:34.401
tantric sexual techniques
can extend orgasms
by 400% to 500%.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.904
- Whoa.
They actually teach that?
- Teach what?

25:37.036 --> 25:40.028
Extended orgasms
through tantric yoga.
Bones, don’t encourage this guy.

25:40.164 --> 25:42.871
It’s a godly pursuit, man.
[Booth]

25:42.959 --> 25:44.540
What do you have for us?

25:48.214 --> 25:51.877
I followed Gutman
from that gas station
where he works.

Yes, I do.

Noel.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.519
Sat next to a girl wearing
a Led Zeppelin tour T-shirt.

26:12.613 --> 26:15.855
Not a real one.
One ofthose fakes where
Jimmy Page has a Stratocaster...

26:15.950 --> 26:17.611
instead ofa Gibson.

26:17.744 --> 26:20.201
Where did he go?
To a church.
St. Xavier’s.

26:20.288 --> 26:23.906

where they store all these
awesome Christmas decorations.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.911

26:26.002 --> 26:28.994
You could sit down and share
a doobie with them, you know?

26:29.088 --> 26:32.421
I really hope this
has something to do
withJim Dodd.

26:32.508 --> 26:34.464
Not only did
he meet up with Dodd,

26:34.552 --> 26:36.417
he sat next to him
for two hours.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.628
With the life-sizeJesus?

26:38.723 --> 26:42.932
No, man. They were
in a divorce support group.
They’re break-up buddies.

26:43.019 --> 26:45.305
Getting busted by O’Rourke
must have ended
Jim Dodd’s marriage.

26:45.396 --> 26:48.308
Would you say
that these divorce
support groups are angry?

26:48.399 --> 26:49.775
No way.

26:49.859 --> 26:53.147
The guys are all sad and weepy.
The dumped chicks eat it up.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.694
The Dodd dude, he’s hooking up
with at least two of’em,

26:55.782 --> 26:58.364
which is probably why
he goes there eve/y day,

26:58.451 --> 27:03.070
which I know— [ Blows]
’cause I photocopied
the sign-in sheet.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.614
That’s great.
So how’d I do?

27:06.709 --> 27:09.997
Huh? Oh, right. Yeah.
You did great.
Here you go, pal.

[Man]
The loan shark’s got me down
for ﬁve 6 ’5, plus the wg.

to keep his mouth shut
ifanybody asked about me.

gonna be the F.B.|.?

27:31.651 --> 27:32.891
Wouldn’t you run?

27:32.985 --> 27:35.818
And all this hard luck is
because of Bill O’Rourke, right?

27:35.905 --> 27:39.147
What? No. No,
it had nothing
to do with that.

27:39.242 --> 27:43.155

- I didn’t kill him. I swear.

27:43.246 --> 27:45.737

27:45.832 --> 27:48.699
I drove toJersey
to borrow money
from my mom.

27:50.837 --> 27:53.874
’cause the loan shark was
gonna rip my ears off—

So, it takes over two hours
for this computer to render
each new image.

28:13.568 --> 28:17.652
But this last pass gave us
a little more detail
on that photograph.

What is that on her back?

28:20.366 --> 28:23.278

O’Rourke was talking
to his producer.

the sound was distorted
and barely audible.

- No, I didn’t.

Anyway, we still have
a place together.

33:19.248 --> 33:21.455
And Pete knew that
I wanted to get into TV,

33:21.542 --> 33:24.659
so he got me ajob
as a production assistant.

33:24.753 --> 33:30.214
And, um, Billjust kind
of took me under his wing.

33:30.301 --> 33:33.134
Yeah, I’d say so.
Didn’t bother you
that he was married?

33:33.220 --> 33:35.552
Perhaps he wasn’t
fully satisfied
in a long-term relationship.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.182
Bones
What?

33:37.266 --> 33:39.302
It’s understandable.
Needs change.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.142
When did you
last have intercourse?

33:42.229 --> 33:44.515
Is she for real?
/’m sorry.

33:44.607 --> 33:47.440
We have to ask
these kind ofquestions
in a murder investigation.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.857
Intercourse?

33:49.862 --> 33:51.352
Friday night.

33:51.447 --> 33:54.610
[Snickers]
Just before
he disappeared.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.361
What happened Holly?

33:56.452 --> 33:59.410
You’re lying there
in his arms.

33:59.496 --> 34:01.873
You tell him you’re tired
of his wife, you know, the money.

34:01.957 --> 34:04.539
I never cared
about the money.

34:04.627 --> 34:07.039
So you tell him
that he should leave her.

34:07.129 --> 34:09.290
But he says he’s got
a life with her, a daughter.

34:09.381 --> 34:12.873
And right there, you snap.
You realize you’ve been used.

34:12.968 --> 34:16.335
So you show him a picture
ofthe two ofyou.

34:19.308 --> 34:20.798
Oh, my God.

34:22.645 --> 34:25.352
You cram this down his throat,
and you shoot him.

34:25.439 --> 34:30.024
Do you have
any body mod/ﬁcations
other than the piercmg,

34:30.110 --> 34:31.816
Ms. Markwell?

34:33.072 --> 34:35.063
What, like fake boobs?
No. Like...

34:35.157 --> 34:36.863
tattoos.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.290
- I have to, right?
- Afraid so.

35:04.019 --> 35:07.182
[Snifﬂes]
You know, I loved Bill.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.306
Ididn’t kill him.

35:20.202 --> 35:22.614
[Beeping]

35:25.332 --> 35:29.792
And there you have it.
You are busted, Billy.

35:29.878 --> 35:33.496
Holly admits it’s her
in the picture, but insists
she didn’t kill him.

35:33.590 --> 35:36.206
Well, ifdenial is severe enough,
she might actually believe that.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.629
I know what was used to cram
the picture down his throat.
Because ofwhat I found.

35:38.721 --> 35:40.962
- Hi, Dr. Brennan.
- I don’t fraternize at work.

35:41.056 --> 35:45.015
Daisy found the fractures
on the saggital suture, which
contained some particulates.

35:45.102 --> 35:47.684
- Told you.
- They are chlorinated polyethylene.

35:47.771 --> 35:50.148
/t’s the rubber
used on the tail
of a microphone.

35:50.232 --> 35:53.269
The copper wire we found
in his intestine was
from inside that rubber cap.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.193
Putrescent gasses
forced the wire
into the esophagus,

35:56.280 --> 36:01.320
and the buoyancy ofthe outhouse
sewage caused it to migrate
up the digestive tract...

36:01.410 --> 36:02.775
to the intestine.

36:02.870 --> 36:05.156
Well, Holly had access
to the microphone.

36:05.247 --> 36:08.159
She’s small Do you think
she could ha ve upended
a 780-pound man...

36:08.250 --> 36:09.660
and placed him in a poop pit?

36:09.752 --> 36:13.461
You’re her size.
Pick up Dr. Sweets
and turn him upside down.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.833
- What?
- That’s not gonna happen.

36:15.966 --> 36:17.877
I have to.
Oh, no, no.

36:17.968 --> 36:20.459
No. No, you don’t. You don’t.
You don’t. That’s fine.

36:21.930 --> 36:25.138
- N ice.
- [Saroyan ]
S 0 it’s probably not Holly.

36:25.225 --> 36:26.965
Anyone else have access
to the equipment?

36:27.061 --> 36:28.551
The print was e-mailed
to somebody.

36:28.645 --> 36:30.897
The murderer was surprised
and enraged by that image.

36:32.399 --> 36:35.061
I minored in psychology.

36:35.152 --> 36:36.642
ReaHy?

36:36.737 --> 36:38.147
Yeah.

36:40.449 --> 36:43.691
But Holly wou/dn ’t be surprised
She knew she slept with B/ll.

36:43.786 --> 36:47.244
RIght. But someone who was sleeping
with either O’Rourke or Holly...

36:47.331 --> 36:48.741
might have seen this.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.788
The image triggered
the killer’s rage.

36:50.876 --> 36:53.208
There’s only one way
to avenge that violation.

36:53.295 --> 36:56.378
The killer had to make sure
that this image died
with O’Rourke.

36:56.465 --> 36:57.955
That’s brilliant.

37:00.177 --> 37:01.758
I know who did it.

37:05.015 --> 37:08.758
So you’re sure? Ow!
Yeah. It’s the only person
who makes sense.

37:08.852 --> 37:11.594
Mark, wha-what
are you doing here?

37:11.688 --> 37:15.021
Well, you told me
to pick you up. Dinner?

37:15.109 --> 37:19.068
I am so sorry. I—
There’s been an emergency.

37:19.154 --> 37:21.486
Okay. Do you want me
to reschedule or—

37:21.615 --> 37:23.230
Temperance.
[laughs]
/ason.

37:23.367 --> 37:26.279
What are you doing here?
We’re going
to Coldplay, remember?

37:26.370 --> 37:28.326
- You remember Coldplay.
- Coldplay?

37:28.414 --> 37:31.121
Sorry. I’ve been
distracted by the case.

37:31.208 --> 37:33.449
Why don ’t we ever
go to a concert?

37:33.544 --> 37:37.583
As a matter of fact,
why don ’t we ever
lea ve your bedroom?

37:37.673 --> 37:39.880
Um, can we talk
about this later?
We’re about to arrest—

37:39.967 --> 37:42.379
- You’re dating this guy?
- I don’t like that term.

37:42.469 --> 37:45.211
/t has an antiquated moral
and needless/y restrictive
connotat/on.

37:45.347 --> 37:49.010
And who are you?
Obviously a guy who’s
not doing as well as you.

37:50.018 --> 37:51.599
This isJason.

37:51.687 --> 37:54.429
/ason, Mark
Mark, jason.

37:54.523 --> 37:57.310
Please understand jason.
You’re ve/y good-look/ng.

37:57.401 --> 38:00.188
But sexual attraction
is an involuntary
hormonal response...

38:00.279 --> 38:04.147
involving an increase
in neutrophins
and testosterone.

38:04.241 --> 38:05.526
So you get to go out?

38:06.869 --> 38:10.657
Mark, you are a strong
and attentive man.

38:10.747 --> 38:14.365
ButJason is more stimulating
intellectually.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.667
That’s not the only way
I could be stimulating.

38:16.753 --> 38:19.085
Um, murderer?

38:19.173 --> 38:20.754
Murder— Yes.

38:20.841 --> 38:22.547
What do you do
with this one, Temperance?

38:22.634 --> 38:24.545
Oh.
[Chuckles]

38:24.636 --> 38:26.843
This, uh—
Booth is my partner.
That’s all.

38:28.557 --> 38:30.388
- We should go.
- Yes. Okay.

38:30.476 --> 38:32.216
All right. Oh,Jason.

38:32.311 --> 38:35.428
We can talk at the concert.
/ ’// meet you out front by 8:00.

38:35.522 --> 38:39.731
And, Mark, we can talk
later at my apartment.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.730
Yeah? Yes. See you, boys.
Thanks. Grab one ofthose.

38:46.909 --> 38:49.901
Th-This is crazy.
Why would I kill him?

38:49.995 --> 38:52.236
I mean, Bill and I
were like family.

38:52.331 --> 38:54.287
Because he was sleeping
with your girlfriend.

38:54.374 --> 38:57.616
Although not only did
you lose your girlfriend,
you lost yourjob.

38:57.711 --> 39:00.669
- It was not a good choice.
- What’s she talking about?

39:00.756 --> 39:03.122
Look— No, Holly and I are—
We’rejust roommates.

39:03.217 --> 39:05.924
But you used
to be a couple, and you
were in love with her.

39:06.053 --> 39:08.510
And you felt that
Bill ruined it for you.
No.

39:08.597 --> 39:12.465
You said that O’Rourke
wasn’t home when you went
to pick him up Saturday morning.

39:12.601 --> 39:15.013
That’s not true.
You brought him
his usual cup of coffee.

39:15.103 --> 39:17.685
But this time,
you put in something
a little special.

39:17.773 --> 39:19.479
Tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride.

39:19.566 --> 39:22.057
That right there is squint talk
for eyedrops.

39:22.152 --> 39:25.565
An old bartender’s trick,
guaranteed to give Bill the runs.

39:25.656 --> 39:27.738
You guys don’t know
what you’re talking about.

39:27.824 --> 39:30.156
ReaHy?

39:30.244 --> 39:32.360
- Where did you get that?
- What’d you do, Pete?

39:32.454 --> 39:35.946
Set up your own camera,
shoot your own show
so you could bust Bill?

39:42.548 --> 39:45.631
Ijust lost it.
[Exhales]

39:50.097 --> 39:52.053
Look, I’m a nice guy.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.392
You can ask anybody.

39:55.811 --> 39:57.802
Ijust lost it.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.161
Hey.

40:16.248 --> 40:20.036
Come on in.
You look nice, Dr. Brennan.

40:20.127 --> 40:22.743
Oh, thank you. |—

40:22.838 --> 40:25.420
/ was supposed to go
to a gal/e/y opening
ton/ght.

40:25.549 --> 40:28.586
What, didJason get
a new tight suit?
With Mark.

40:28.677 --> 40:32.215
- The two amigos.
- I thought he was more ofyour
stay-at-home kind of a guy.

40:32.306 --> 40:34.513
/ was visit/ng the possibility
that / might enjoy him...

40:34.600 --> 40:37.091
in a strictly
conversational setting.

40:37.185 --> 40:38.766
And?

40:38.854 --> 40:42.438
Since the murder, I’m considering
the argument for monogamy.

40:42.524 --> 40:45.687
[Tongue Clicks]
Write that one down, Sweets.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.233
I have a positive
inﬂuence on her.

40:47.362 --> 40:48.943
No, you don’t.
Yes, I do.

40:49.031 --> 40:51.317
Mark broke up with me.

40:51.408 --> 40:54.150
Oh. I’m sorry.

40:54.286 --> 40:57.449
Well, what about gayJason?
Him too.

40:57.539 --> 41:02.329
I guess they weren’t
as accepting of each other
as I thought, so—

41:03.962 --> 41:07.580
/s it typical for you two
to discuss your lo ve lives?

41:07.674 --> 41:11.007
Well, only when she has
naked men in her apartment.

41:11.094 --> 41:14.678
No, that’s not true. I’m very
open about my relationships,
as opposed to you.

41:14.765 --> 41:16.801
Okay, what’s that
supposed to mean?

41:16.892 --> 41:18.428
You’re very secretive,

41:18.518 --> 41:20.930
as ifdiscussing
your sex life would
somehow be offensive to me.

41:21.063 --> 41:23.475
I assume you are
sexually active.
I do fine.

41:23.565 --> 41:27.057
Does it seem that
your partn ershIp pro VIdes
a surrogate relationsh/p,

41:27.152 --> 41:29.108
making it more difficult
to form other bonds?

41:29.196 --> 41:32.233
A surrogate relationship
wouldn’t necessarily
be such a bad thing,

41:32.324 --> 41:34.315
because then I could avoid
the sting of rejection,

41:34.409 --> 41:38.869
which, however fleeting,
is still uncomfortable.

41:38.955 --> 41:41.822
So—
Right.

41:41.917 --> 41:43.657
Okay, look, I’m sorry.

41:43.752 --> 41:46.539
You know what? If Mark and Jason
don’t know how lucky they are,

41:46.672 --> 41:50.039
they don’t deserve you
in the first place.
All relationships are temporary.

41:50.133 --> 41:51.998
That’s not true, Bones.

41:52.094 --> 41:55.006
You’re wrong, okay?
There is someone for everyone,

41:55.097 --> 41:59.841
someone you’re meant
to spend the rest ofyour life with.

41:59.935 --> 42:01.596
All right?

42:01.687 --> 42:04.599
Youjust have
to be open enough to see it.

42:07.401 --> 42:09.266
That’s all.

42:19.746 --> 42:22.237
Come on.
I’ll buy you dinner.

42:22.332 --> 42:24.914
Hey, I can be fun in a strictly
conversational setting.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.377
See?
Surrogate relationships.

42:26.461 --> 42:28.713
Surrogate nothing, okay?
It’s a meal with drinks.

42:28.839 --> 42:31.205
/ust strict/y
conversational.
I can come too?

42:31.299 --> 42:35.133
Actually, our partnership
does make it difficult
to form other bonds.

42:35.262 --> 42:37.218
N o o ffe n s e.
Our session isn ’t over yet.

42:37.305 --> 42:39.512
- How about Chinese?
- I love Chinese.

42:39.641 --> 42:42.348
Love it.
I feel more like Thai.

42:42.436 --> 42:44.347
Thai? I got coupons
to Hop Lee.

42:44.438 --> 42:46.520
What,
you’re gonna take me out
fora discount meal?

42:46.606 --> 42:50.815
What? There ’5 two for one.
And they throw In some sake.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.484
[Beeping]

42:55.365 --> 42:58.198
Hi. Is this Daisy Wick?

42:58.285 --> 43:00.446
Hey. This is Lance.

43:02.456 --> 43:04.947
Uh, the shrink? Yeah.

43:05.041 --> 43:08.124
Listen.
Sorry you got fired.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.999
Nothing.
What are you doing?

43:12.090 --> 43:14.627
The accordion?

43:14.718 --> 43:17.881
No. No, no. |—| play
a little bass though.

43:51.755 --> 43:53.165
What’s that mean?
