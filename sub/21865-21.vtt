(knocking)
Hello!

00:08.075 --> 00:10.611
Anybody home? Trish?

00:10.611 --> 00:11.979
NATHAN:
The lamps were flying

00:11.979 --> 00:14.081
and glass was shattering
everywhere.

00:14.081 --> 00:16.617
He got one tiny piece
of glass in his face

00:16.617 --> 00:18.218
and he started bawling
like a baby.

00:18.218 --> 00:20.220
(laughing)
(laughing):
He's still like that.

00:20.220 --> 00:23.290
NATHAN:
Like, "Dad, Dad, take
me to a doctor."

00:23.290 --> 00:25.292
Oh, but, you know, Martin was
a good‐looking kid, though,

00:25.292 --> 00:26.994
when he was little,
except when he cried.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.962
He was a, he was an ugly crier.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.631
No. (laughs)
NATHAN: Yeah.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.699
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:32.699 --> 00:34.101
Well, I'm just making myself
at home, son.

00:34.101 --> 00:36.236
They're like your
family, right?

00:36.236 --> 00:37.938
Well, that makes them mine, too.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.673
I'll tell you what.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.708
Huh?
Come down here.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.878
We were just about to watch TV.
You remember this?

00:44.878 --> 00:48.148
TRISH: Oh.
NATHAN:
Oh, this was a fun day.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.884
TRISH: Yeah?
NATHAN: That's my boy's bat.
I love that bat.

00:50.884 --> 00:51.952
Yeah.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.988
Oh, that's gonna leave a mark.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.123
(Nathan and Trish laugh)

00:56.123 --> 00:58.225
Come here.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.030
Ooh.
(distorted laughter)

01:04.264 --> 01:05.666
(microwave beeping)

01:05.666 --> 01:07.768
Oh. Popcorn's ready.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.269
Trish, be a doll.

01:09.269 --> 01:10.904
TRISH:
I got it, I got it.
Rog.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.839
(distorted laughter)

01:12.839 --> 01:15.042
Well, that's
a nice couple.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.677
(chuckles)

01:16.677 --> 01:18.278
Oh, son.

01:18.278 --> 01:19.913
It's all over.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.949
You can't save 'em.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.823
Trish!

01:35.162 --> 01:37.164
(seagulls squawking)

01:39.232 --> 01:42.235
CAHILL: <i>Okay, Riggs, what do</i>
<i>you think the dream means?</i>

01:42.235 --> 01:43.737
RIGGS:
<i>Well, that's an easy one, Doc.</i>

01:43.737 --> 01:45.839
I invited a monster
into my world

01:45.839 --> 01:47.107
and now he's gonna blow it up.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.642
Don't have to be Freud
to figure that one out.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.111
Your father's been here
how long?

01:51.111 --> 01:53.113
Six weeks, three days,

01:53.113 --> 01:54.615
and nine hours.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.249
40 miles down the road.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.818
Have you been
to see him yet?

01:57.818 --> 01:59.553
Only in my dreams.

01:59.553 --> 02:00.754
You know the worst part
about it?

02:00.754 --> 02:02.723
They're always at the Murtaughs.

02:02.723 --> 02:03.991
You don't have to be Freud.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.796
I knew it was a mistake
bringing him out here.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.032
(clucks tongue)
I did it anyway.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.767
Your father
had been stabbed.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.036
Riggs, do you really think
you had a choice?

02:16.036 --> 02:18.939
Could've left his ass in Texas.

02:18.939 --> 02:21.775
Where he would've
been killed.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.078
Why do I care?

02:25.078 --> 02:28.615
He's family.

02:28.615 --> 02:31.585
Some messes you sign up for
simply by showing up.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.198
(music stops)
Listen.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.133
The captain sets the tone
for the office, Bailey.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.668
That's a fact.

03:21.668 --> 03:24.604
And don't you steal none of my
dance moves at the police ball.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.807
Right, okay.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.809
James Brown is the tone. Got it.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.745
Hey, look, I know what
they're saying out there.

03:31.745 --> 03:35.048
That I'm only here
because the LAPD charter

03:35.048 --> 03:36.750
requires an interim captain

03:36.750 --> 03:39.219
while Avery is out.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.554
And that a mannequin
could do your job.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.055
They're... that's...
who said that?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.557
Look, I'm just reporting

03:43.557 --> 03:45.926
what everyone else
was saying, not me.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.227
You know what? Fine.
You know what?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.563
Maybe I can't hire
or fire anyone.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.864
You definitely can't, no.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.632
But I do have
some authority.

03:52.632 --> 03:55.836
I can requisition the
hell out of stuff.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.637
Look at this. The catalog.

03:57.637 --> 04:01.575
All the gear that only
a captain can order.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.243
Motocross bikes,

04:03.243 --> 04:05.078
K‐9 unit.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.181
Right here.
LAPD Ferrari.

04:08.181 --> 04:11.017
O‐Okay, Murtaugh, this
really seems like a bad idea.
What?

04:11.017 --> 04:13.954
Bailey, are you here
to undermine me?

04:13.954 --> 04:16.623
You want me to play "The Big
Payback"? Is that what it is?

04:16.623 --> 04:18.091
No, I'm here
to deliver a message

04:18.091 --> 04:20.227
that the commissioners
are requesting the captain

04:20.227 --> 04:21.728
on the executive floor.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.930
The executive floor?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.999
I've never been
invited to the exec‐‐

04:25.999 --> 04:27.601
I heard they have
an omelet bar up there.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.003
I'll bring you back some cheese.

04:30.003 --> 04:33.673
(sighs heavily)
It's gonna be a long week.

04:33.673 --> 04:36.977
Oh, fiber, fiber, fiber.

04:36.977 --> 04:41.181
Let's see.
We have hot cross buns

04:41.181 --> 04:42.783
and a prune strudel.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.952
Here's the situation,
Interim Captain Murtaugh.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.821
Please,
just call me Captain.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.689
Why waste time
with extra syllables?

04:49.689 --> 04:51.091
You know? (chuckles)

04:52.993 --> 04:54.694
Do you know the Conlon family?

04:54.694 --> 04:55.695
Conlon family.

04:55.695 --> 04:57.130
Of course.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.899
An hour ago,

04:58.899 --> 05:01.067
Mark Conlon's wife, Lisa,

05:01.067 --> 05:03.170
was abducted from their
Holmby Hills estate.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.871
We got lucky.

05:04.871 --> 05:07.874
Neighborhood kid accidentally
filmed the whole thing

05:07.874 --> 05:09.509
on a toy drone.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.181
(whistles)

05:15.715 --> 05:17.651
Not good.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.152
(overlapping shouting)

05:25.892 --> 05:27.227
RIGGS:
All right, Rog,

05:27.227 --> 05:28.728
where's this omelet bar?

05:28.728 --> 05:30.530
You know? Hey, I was
thinking of getting maybe

05:30.530 --> 05:31.932
like a, like a little
scramble or something,

05:31.932 --> 05:33.099
maybe with some onions
and some jalapeños.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.801
Riggs, what are you
doing up here?

05:34.801 --> 05:36.236
The executive floor

05:36.236 --> 05:37.771
is for captains and above.

05:37.771 --> 05:38.905
We invited Detective Riggs.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.841
What? Why would you...?

05:40.841 --> 05:42.676
Gentlemen, take a look.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.144
We got two distinct leads
from the drone video.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.178
The first is this van.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.547
Note the mismatched panels.

05:47.547 --> 05:48.882
And the second

05:48.882 --> 05:50.884
is our perp's tattoo

05:50.884 --> 05:53.253
clearly
identifying him as...

05:53.253 --> 05:54.821
Aryan Fraternity of Texas.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.923
Since Detective Riggs

05:56.923 --> 05:59.559
has a family relationship
with a ranking A. F. T. member

05:59.559 --> 06:00.694

Well, if you're counting on me,
Ted, then we're all screwed.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.005
Sorry, guys.
I'm family in name only.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.608
A.F.T. is his family, not me.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.209
He'll never help.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.711
We think he will.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.914
Why?

06:20.914 --> 06:22.782
Conlons carry a lot of weight
in this city.

06:22.782 --> 06:25.518
In exchange for information
leading to Lisa Conlon's return,

07:21.841 --> 07:22.909
But emotionally,

I've been captain

09:38.511 --> 09:40.046
And you better get
a move on, son.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.047
These guys don't
mess around.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.650
And the odds are,
as soon as these guys

09:43.650 --> 09:47.220
get whatever they want,
they're gonna kill that girl.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.860
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

09:56.062 --> 09:57.497
A bartender in Palmdale.

09:57.497 --> 10:00.200
I have my second and third
best detectives following up.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.868
That's, uh, Detective Riggs?

10:01.868 --> 10:03.670
So I should expect to hear

10:03.670 --> 10:06.739
Palmdale is burning
any second now?

10:06.739 --> 10:08.274
I've read his file.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.909
Captain, I want live
minute‐by‐minute reports

10:09.909 --> 10:11.044
from Palmdale.

10:11.044 --> 10:14.047
Yeah, well, that's not
my leadership style.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.949
I'm more into
empowering people,

10:15.949 --> 10:18.618
giving them the tools
and the encouragement,

10:18.618 --> 10:19.886
the freedom,
you know.
Mm‐hmm. Yeah.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.821
(stammers)
Open line to Riggs.

10:21.821 --> 10:23.590
Now.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.725
(phone rings)

10:25.725 --> 10:29.028
Murtaugh. You feeling left out?

10:29.028 --> 10:30.964
I need an update on Riggs.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.966
What level of damage
has he caused?

10:32.966 --> 10:36.302
Okay. He's been in the bar
for about ten minutes,

10:36.302 --> 10:38.605
so I would say maybe DEFCON 5.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.006
DEFCON 5?!

10:40.006 --> 10:42.075
Holy crap!

10:42.075 --> 10:43.843
No, five's the best.
One is the worst.

10:43.843 --> 10:44.978
It goes backwards.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.246
Goes backwards.
It goes backwards.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.314
Well, that's
counterintuitive.
Not really.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.950
I mean, there's a lot of
angry parents out there

10:50.950 --> 10:54.721
that want to know why you're
serving their children alcohol.

10:54.721 --> 10:55.922
I told you.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.857
I don't serve minors.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.659
How would you know?

10:59.659 --> 11:00.660
You don't check IDs,

11:00.660 --> 11:02.896
which is becoming
a really big problem.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.064
I wouldn't do that.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.567
See, I haven't shot
a dumbass all day

11:07.567 --> 11:08.935
and I got quotas to meet.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.505
As a matter of fact,
when I come back in here,

11:12.505 --> 11:14.073
I'm gonna be checking
everyone's IDs.

11:14.073 --> 11:16.209
And lay 'em here on the table,
and no Canadian ones.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.544
All right?
I'm looking at you.

11:17.544 --> 11:18.945
Outside.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.915
Get your ass outside!
Hey, I got kids of my own.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.216
I wouldn't dare do
anything like that.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.217
Hey, hey, here.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.518
That'll cover the damages.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.854
All right?
Lisa Conlon.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.222
She was kidnapped
this morning.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.223
What have you heard?

11:30.223 --> 11:32.091
Who says I heard anything?

11:33.893 --> 11:35.962
Nathan Riggs sent me.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.764
He's my dad.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.933
You're Nathan Riggs' kid.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.735
I should have recognized
the crazy in your eyes.

11:42.735 --> 11:43.937
You got one hell of a family.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.838
Look, I need to find Lisa.

11:45.838 --> 11:47.574
So, whatever you know,
start talking fast.

11:50.009 --> 11:53.580
Local A. F. T., they got
this unbreakable pipeline

11:53.580 --> 11:56.783
that's running through Mexico,
pulling meth, and...

11:56.783 --> 11:57.784
The pipeline broke.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.787
I heard they panicked,
grabbed a girl...

12:00.787 --> 12:02.755
Raise some cash,
buy their way out of trouble.

12:02.755 --> 12:04.224
I need a name, Travis.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.193
Yeah, I don't have one
for you.
Travis...

12:07.193 --> 12:09.762
I need a nickname,
an address...

12:09.762 --> 12:10.930
something.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.602
Turn around.
What?

12:15.602 --> 12:16.903
Turn around.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.207
There's something.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.509
RIGGS:
Hey!

12:23.509 --> 12:24.644
This your van?

12:26.512 --> 12:29.015
Um... no, it's my friend's.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.049
He said I could
borrow it.

12:30.049 --> 12:32.051
Do some errands.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.219
Right. Yeah.
It's good‐looking.

12:33.219 --> 12:34.721
I been thinking about
getting myself one.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.956
I was curious how much
storage they had in the back.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.727
Hey, Riggs!

12:40.727 --> 12:42.195
Yeah?

12:42.195 --> 12:44.797
MAN: Why you talking
to that cop?

12:44.797 --> 12:45.965
Gun!

12:45.965 --> 12:47.300
(gunfire)

12:56.042 --> 12:59.279
RIGGS: Go, go, go, go!
Bailey, move!

12:59.279 --> 13:01.648
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go...

13:09.722 --> 13:11.791
(car alarms blaring)

13:31.177 --> 13:33.279
Is this about the van?

13:33.279 --> 13:35.682
What you need to think about
is what <i>didn't</i> blow up.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.750
Right?
Like the bar.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.019
Or the gas station.
Or the palm trees.

13:40.019 --> 13:41.087
Well, one palm tree.

13:41.087 --> 13:44.357
No, this is about me
saying I'm sorry.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.359
Oh.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.995
You finally seeing
the whole temporary

13:48.995 --> 13:50.263
captain thing for
what it really is?

13:50.263 --> 13:53.299
I mean, you know
they went alphabetically

13:53.299 --> 13:55.668
until someone finally
said yes, and, I mean...

13:55.668 --> 13:56.803
Riggs, I'm sorry

13:56.803 --> 13:58.771
that I didn't go
with you to Helendale

13:58.771 --> 14:00.973
to see your dad.

14:03.576 --> 14:04.877
Come on, Rog, you know
I wouldn't let that happen.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.248
What you got, Bailey?
Well, I found something,

14:09.248 --> 14:11.117
but it doesn't really
make any sense.

14:11.117 --> 14:14.120
The explosion destroyed almost
all the evidence in the van.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.122
Almost?

14:16.122 --> 14:18.691
Well, CSIs found a thermos
with some DNA on it,

14:18.691 --> 14:20.560
and I ran it through
the DNA database, and, um...

14:20.560 --> 14:23.863
our perp has a 50%
match to Nathan Riggs.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865
That's impossible.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.734
He's been in prison
for four years.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.736
I know, but
the match indicates

14:29.736 --> 14:31.237
that he's a child
of Nathan Riggs.

14:31.237 --> 14:32.872
Yeah, but that's...

14:43.049 --> 14:45.885
You mean there might be
two of them?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.087
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

14:52.158 --> 14:55.928
So, what's his name?

14:55.928 --> 15:00.533
Garrett.
Garrett Riggs.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.702
He's 19.
His mother?

15:02.702 --> 15:04.637
She's out of the picture.
Got her own set of problems.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.639
Now, listen to me, son,
he's not like you.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.708
He needs looking out for.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.209
Oh, yeah?

15:10.209 --> 15:12.211
And is that some of the
looking after that you gave me?

15:12.211 --> 15:14.013
'Cause, boy, that's some
tough love right there.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.715
I learned from my mistakes,
all right‐‐

15:15.715 --> 15:17.984
I've done right by Garrett.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.987
Tried to keep him out of this
whole A. F. T. thing, you know.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.321
Even from jail.

15:22.321 --> 15:25.324
Ain't that sweet.

15:25.324 --> 15:27.326
Where is he?

15:29.562 --> 15:31.831
He's with a friend that
was supposed to make sure

15:31.831 --> 15:33.299
to keep him out
of this crap.

15:33.299 --> 15:35.034
Does your good friend
got a name?

15:35.034 --> 15:36.569
Son, you got
to listen to me.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.738
Garrett's not part of this.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.307
You got to promise me
to watch out for him.

15:41.307 --> 15:42.942
Name.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.580
Llewyn Cooke.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.766
So, where is she?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.103
(shuddering)

16:12.972 --> 16:15.575
You didn't get her
any clothes.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.644
There was no time.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.314
We had to split because
you let that dumbass Garrett

16:21.314 --> 16:22.648
get rid of the van.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.816
Then all of these cops are...

16:23.816 --> 16:25.785
Oh! Oh...

16:29.188 --> 16:32.024
Get the girl a blanket.

16:32.024 --> 16:35.294
I need her to record
a message to the husband.

16:35.294 --> 16:36.696
It'd be nice
if she could speak.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.599
Now, do you have
any more complaints?

16:39.599 --> 16:42.068
(Lisa shuddering)

16:51.644 --> 16:54.614
♪ Mi‐mi‐mi‐mi‐mi‐mi‐mi. ♪

16:54.614 --> 16:56.749
Check.
This is Monty.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.985
Is that‐‐ is that
short for Montgomery?

16:58.985 --> 17:00.186
Monty Jenkins.
Just Monty?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.054
Okay, 'cause I know there were
civil rights atrocities

17:02.054 --> 17:03.556
in Montgomery, and I'm woke.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.258
What the hell is this?

17:05.258 --> 17:06.926
Oh, Captain,
won't you join us?

17:06.926 --> 17:09.829
This is perfect timing because
I'm just deposing Montgomery

17:09.829 --> 17:11.230
in the class action lawsuit.

17:11.230 --> 17:13.099
The lawsuit
against me and Riggs?

17:13.099 --> 17:14.767
No, actually, correction.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.869
The lawsuit is against
Detective Murtaugh,

17:16.869 --> 17:18.804
not Captain Murtaugh,
so you're fine.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.674
And, uh, Monty here was just
telling me about the grenades

17:21.674 --> 17:23.643
that you borrowed from Property.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.311
That was Riggs.
Mm‐hmm.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.946
I don't remember it like that.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.047
LEO:
Oh, by the way,

17:28.047 --> 17:29.115
I'm also adding Mark Conlon

17:29.115 --> 17:30.182
to the class action suit.

17:30.182 --> 17:32.818
Leo, please tell me
you are not harassing

17:32.818 --> 17:34.987
a guy whose wife
was just abducted.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.589
(switches off tape recorder)
No. No.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.590
First of all, we don't say‐‐

17:37.590 --> 17:39.125
we don't say "harassment"
anymore.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.027
'Cause that means...
touching stuff.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.896
But, no, I've just been
starting a dialogue with him,

17:43.896 --> 17:45.031
trying to‐‐ mostly I'm just
following him around.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.699
But I tell you, he's not happy.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.734
And you can see it
in his posture.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.336
Like yours.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.004
Shut up, Monty.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.073
Actually, we followed Conlon
to three different pawnshops,

17:54.073 --> 17:56.709
and he was very brusque
with the owners.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.011
That is not a happy man.

17:59.011 --> 18:02.014
Pawnshops?
What was he doing?

18:02.014 --> 18:03.983
Mostly just selling art, but now
he's got a great big duffel bag

18:03.983 --> 18:05.217
full of cash.

18:05.217 --> 18:06.886
We know what that means.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.021
The duffel bag
of litigiousness.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.022
Show me that cheddar.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.725
He's making a ransom drop.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.126
What were the pawnshops?

18:14.126 --> 18:17.597
Ooh, um, Casa Empeña?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.098
Write 'em down.
Okay.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.567
(car horn honking)

18:28.107 --> 18:29.942
Are my feelings hurt?

18:29.942 --> 18:31.243
A little.

18:31.243 --> 18:34.080
You were supposed to
get in touch with me

18:34.080 --> 18:36.549
if the kidnappers called.
You can't be here.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.685
So, that's a yes,
they were in touch?

18:39.685 --> 18:42.188
They e‐mailed a video of Lisa.

18:42.188 --> 18:45.057
Told me to bring
$600,000 in small bills,

18:45.057 --> 18:47.693
and they didn't want to see
a single cop.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.595
They say anything about,
like, two cops?

18:49.595 --> 18:50.763
'Cause we could
have a loophole.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.733
(phone ringing)

18:53.733 --> 18:55.234
I guess that would be
for you.

18:55.234 --> 18:57.069
(phone continues ringing)

19:04.610 --> 19:05.611
Hello.

19:05.611 --> 19:06.612
MAN (on phone):
Get on the bus.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.650
Now, Conlon.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.588
(coins clinking)

19:23.729 --> 19:25.698
You stay with Conlon.

19:33.906 --> 19:36.208
Uh, excuse me.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.543
Shh, shh.

19:37.543 --> 19:39.278
DRIVER: Sir, you need
to step behind the line.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.219
It's the cops.
Get out of here, go!

19:47.219 --> 19:50.790
(tires screeching)

19:52.191 --> 19:53.759
Yeah, excuse me,

19:53.759 --> 19:55.728
I‐I need you
to follow that car.

19:55.728 --> 19:56.929
Sir, that car is
not on my route.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.664
And this bus is not
going anywhere

19:58.664 --> 20:00.266
until you step
behind the line.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.867
I am a police captain.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.169
I don't care
if you're a general,

20:03.169 --> 20:05.771
you step behind the line!

20:05.771 --> 20:07.740
I'm behind the line.
Follow the car.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.008
Okay, I'm calling
the police.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.276
RIGGS:
Garrett!

20:10.276 --> 20:12.244
Hey!
WOMAN:
Hey.

20:12.244 --> 20:13.612
MAN:
Watch out, man.

20:13.612 --> 20:14.847
MAN 2:
Easy, man.
Garrett!

20:14.847 --> 20:16.082
Hey, Garrett!

20:16.082 --> 20:18.250
WOMAN 2:
Hey!

20:28.060 --> 20:30.362
Garrett! Hey!

20:30.362 --> 20:32.364
WOMAN 3:
<i>Somebody call the cops!</i>

20:32.364 --> 20:35.101
DRIVER:
He says he <i>is</i> the police.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.135
We've been commandeered,
people.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.336
(panicked shouting)

20:37.336 --> 20:39.205
MURTAUGH:
<i>Hey, no cause for alarm.</i>

20:39.205 --> 20:43.275
This is being handled
by a LAPD captain.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.644
Who's never driven
a bus before.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.618
Not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!

20:53.686 --> 20:54.687
(alarmed cries)

20:54.687 --> 20:55.855
Help me!

20:55.855 --> 20:58.057
(tires screeching)

20:58.057 --> 20:59.925
(screaming)
(horn honking)

21:12.905 --> 21:14.707
(driver screaming)

21:14.707 --> 21:16.242
Oh. Whoa!

21:16.242 --> 21:17.676
Oh!

21:17.676 --> 21:19.011
MAN:
Yo, you crazy, man!

21:19.011 --> 21:21.113
DRIVER:
Everybody, get off the bus!

21:21.113 --> 21:22.982
Get off the bus.

21:22.982 --> 21:26.986
Are you all right?
Look at this...

21:26.986 --> 21:29.789
Oh, my God.
(clears throat)

21:29.789 --> 21:31.991
DRIVER:
He said his name was Murtaugh.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.793
Captain Murtaugh.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.796
M‐U‐R‐T‐A‐U‐G‐H.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.631
Don't call him.
Captain Murtaugh!

21:38.631 --> 21:41.300
Murtaugh, people.
Murtaugh!

21:41.300 --> 21:44.203
It's Murtaugh.
MURTAUGH:
Huh.

21:44.203 --> 21:47.907
So, not‐‐ I didn't hit nothing
over there.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.775
RIGGS:
Hey!

21:51.277 --> 21:54.046
Garrett!
Hey!

21:56.668 --> 21:57.770
Garrett.

21:57.770 --> 22:00.005
I didn't want to do it.
They‐they made me do it.

22:00.005 --> 22:01.573
Look, I just want
to talk to you.

22:02.608 --> 22:03.876
I didn't have a choice.

22:05.644 --> 22:07.012
(tires screeching)

22:08.781 --> 22:11.116
(groans)

22:21.794 --> 22:25.264
The fallout has been
monsoon‐like.

22:25.264 --> 22:27.232
The kidnappers
remain unidentified.

22:27.232 --> 22:28.700
Except for the
one in a coma.

22:28.700 --> 22:31.170
And Lisa Conlon?
Still missing.

22:31.170 --> 22:33.172
Her husband is raising
hell with everyone,

22:33.172 --> 22:35.073
and the governor himself
is now involved.
If‐if I might.

22:36.108 --> 22:37.376
Debra,

22:37.376 --> 22:38.343
Ted...

22:39.111 --> 22:40.245
...guy with glasses,

22:40.245 --> 22:41.346
the world

22:41.346 --> 22:43.382
is an imperfect place.

22:43.382 --> 22:44.650
Were mistakes made?

22:44.650 --> 22:46.718
Perhaps.

22:46.718 --> 22:49.221
But to save Mrs. Conlon,

22:49.221 --> 22:51.523
we had to be able to act
at a moment's notice.

22:51.523 --> 22:53.125
And I think
we can all agree,

22:53.125 --> 22:54.326
that as captain,

22:54.326 --> 22:56.495
I improvised a solid plan.

22:56.495 --> 22:57.629
Now,

22:57.629 --> 23:00.265
did my detectives hit
a few speed bumps?

23:00.265 --> 23:01.700
You were one of the detectives.

23:01.700 --> 23:03.068
You destroyed a city bus

23:03.068 --> 23:04.269
and half a dozen vehicles.

23:04.269 --> 23:05.571
Yes, but as detective,

23:05.571 --> 23:09.141
I am heartbroken

23:09.141 --> 23:11.210
that I let
my captain down.

23:11.210 --> 23:12.744
But next time, I...
DEBRA:
Oh, no! No.

23:12.744 --> 23:14.346
There will be no next time.

23:14.346 --> 23:16.615
The FBI is
taking over.
(mouthing)

23:16.615 --> 23:18.217
So, Interim
Captain Murtaugh,

23:18.217 --> 23:22.354
Detective Murtaugh,
any other Murtaughs

23:22.354 --> 23:25.190
that might be in RHD
are to stand down.

23:25.190 --> 23:26.291
Is that clear?

23:28.160 --> 23:30.429
Say the words.

23:30.429 --> 23:32.364
"Stand down" or "it's clear"?

23:32.364 --> 23:34.533
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

23:38.503 --> 23:39.705
Did you find him?

23:39.705 --> 23:42.407
(clears throat)

23:42.407 --> 23:43.709
What happened?

23:43.709 --> 23:45.744
What'd you do?

23:45.744 --> 23:47.312
What did <i>I</i> do?

23:48.513 --> 23:52.117
It was a ransom drop‐off.

23:52.117 --> 23:54.119
And he was right
in the middle of it.

23:54.119 --> 23:56.255
No, I don't believe that.

23:56.255 --> 23:58.757
Hey. He was holding
the money bag.

23:58.757 --> 24:01.693
Well, where is he?

24:01.693 --> 24:03.295
Did you arrest him?

24:07.733 --> 24:09.334
He ran out into the street.

24:09.334 --> 24:10.602
(groans)

24:10.602 --> 24:12.404
Never saw the car coming.

24:12.404 --> 24:14.740
How bad?

24:14.740 --> 24:16.074
Doctors don't know.

24:16.074 --> 24:17.442
He still ain't woke up yet.

24:17.442 --> 24:19.678
I want to see him now.

24:19.678 --> 24:21.346
You can't.
The hell I can't.

24:21.346 --> 24:23.415
The agreement was: I help you,

24:23.415 --> 24:25.150
and you get me out.

24:25.150 --> 24:26.818
Now, I held up my end
of the bargain, Martin.

24:26.818 --> 24:29.588
You messed it up, and then
you got my boy run over!

24:31.623 --> 24:34.192
You're not gonna
blame this on me.

24:34.192 --> 24:37.195
(chuckles)
Oh, man.

24:37.195 --> 24:39.331
This is like Christmas morning
for you, isn't it?

24:39.331 --> 24:41.099
You've been lying
in wait for a chance

24:41.099 --> 24:43.368
to get back at me
for such a long time.

24:43.368 --> 24:44.670
How does it feel?

24:48.173 --> 24:49.708
I'm sorry about your son.

24:49.708 --> 24:51.743
You're sorry
about my son?

24:51.743 --> 24:54.112
Well, how about me, Martin?

24:54.112 --> 24:56.114
You think the A. F. T. guys
haven't figured out

24:56.114 --> 24:57.416
who's talking?

24:57.416 --> 25:00.452
It's on you!

25:00.452 --> 25:02.087
(siren wailing in distance)

25:03.689 --> 25:05.691
(monitor beeping steadily)

25:08.360 --> 25:10.729
MURTAUGH: Hey. I heard
you were still here.

25:12.331 --> 25:13.799
Trying to figure
out what you used

25:13.799 --> 25:15.200
to look like without
the mustache?

25:20.072 --> 25:22.174
Just wanted to see
if there was any change.

25:22.174 --> 25:23.075
So?

25:23.075 --> 25:24.476
Any change?

25:24.476 --> 25:25.677
No.

25:25.677 --> 25:28.080
Doctor said maybe a few
weeks before he wakes up.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.782
Hey, Riggs, you know,
he put himself here, right?

25:36.121 --> 25:39.758
Anyway, the executive floor
took us off the kidnapping.

25:39.758 --> 25:43.228
It's just the FBI now.

25:43.228 --> 25:45.764
And are we gonna
stand for that?

25:48.667 --> 25:50.369
Sure.

25:50.369 --> 25:51.503
Why not?

25:51.503 --> 25:54.172
Because we never stand for that.

25:54.172 --> 25:56.108
Look, I know this deal

25:56.108 --> 25:57.376
with your dad got complicated.

25:57.376 --> 25:59.077
No.

25:59.077 --> 26:01.646
It's not
complicated.

26:01.646 --> 26:03.548
Like you said, Rog,

26:03.548 --> 26:05.584
the kid had it coming.

26:05.584 --> 26:07.185
I'm fine with that.

26:07.185 --> 26:08.720
Okay, maybe you are.

26:08.720 --> 26:11.323
But the point is,
I'm still captain.

26:11.323 --> 26:15.327
So if you're interested, we can
ignore the executive floor,

26:15.327 --> 26:17.229
and bring Lisa
Conlon in ourselves.

26:17.229 --> 26:18.630
You know?

26:18.630 --> 26:21.266
Give you a shot at holding
up your end of the deal

26:21.266 --> 26:23.268
with your dad.

26:31.610 --> 26:33.612
I'm not interested.

26:33.612 --> 26:36.348
Thanks, though, Rog.

26:49.594 --> 26:51.329
What are you doing in here?

26:51.329 --> 26:52.831
Oh, I got up early.

26:52.831 --> 26:56.735
So I started pulling names
of Llewyn Cooke's associates,

26:56.735 --> 26:58.870
anyone with local A. F. T....
No, what are you doing

26:58.870 --> 26:59.938
out here?

26:59.938 --> 27:01.873
Oh.

27:01.873 --> 27:03.642
(quietly):
Kind of felt out of the action.

27:03.642 --> 27:04.876
Ah.
You know,
it's a gilded cage

27:04.876 --> 27:06.445
in there.

27:08.480 --> 27:09.915
I'm gonna take your office.

27:09.915 --> 27:11.316
You got a couch
in there.

27:11.316 --> 27:12.417
I can go
take a nap.

27:12.417 --> 27:15.787
Yeah, it was getting
crowded in there.

27:15.787 --> 27:17.656
Also, I, uh,

27:17.656 --> 27:21.293
ran out
of wall space.

27:21.293 --> 27:24.930
Hey, Riggs, you wouldn't
believe what I can requisition.

27:24.930 --> 27:26.331
Avery's been
holding out on us.

27:26.331 --> 27:27.566
Look at this:
battering ram.

27:27.566 --> 27:29.801
A...
BAILEY:
$31,000 in small bills.

27:31.503 --> 27:33.505
What?
Mark Conlon's duffel bag

27:33.505 --> 27:34.773
can't hold more than $31,000.

27:34.773 --> 27:36.041
That's impossible.

27:36.041 --> 27:37.676
He said the kidnappers
demanded...

27:37.676 --> 27:38.643
$600,000.

27:39.644 --> 27:40.779
Need to talk to Conlon.

27:40.779 --> 27:41.780
BAILEY:
Uh, wait.

27:41.780 --> 27:43.482
I thought they said
we're off the case.

27:43.482 --> 27:45.717
Yeah, but he's captain,
so we can do whatever we want.

27:45.717 --> 27:47.452
You acknowledge I'm captain.

27:47.452 --> 27:49.721
As long as I can
do whatever I want.
Yeah, but I'm captain, though.

27:49.721 --> 27:50.856
I really just want
to do whatever I want.

27:50.856 --> 27:51.923
The captain
will let you do

27:51.923 --> 27:53.825
whatever you want.
Okay, yeah, bye, I'm walking.

27:53.825 --> 27:57.496
(truck beeping in distance)

27:57.496 --> 27:59.498
Sean? Sean!

27:59.498 --> 28:00.832
Sean Banks?

28:00.832 --> 28:02.467
Sean Banks. Hey.

28:02.467 --> 28:03.502
Leo Getz, attorney at law.

28:03.502 --> 28:04.803
Today is your lucky day,

28:04.803 --> 28:07.239
'cause I'm about to make you
a bunch of money.

28:07.239 --> 28:08.607
Yeah, I'm not interested,
all right?

28:08.607 --> 28:10.809
Well, were you, were you
on a city bus yesterday

28:10.809 --> 28:13.945
that was negligently
commandeered by the LAPD?

28:13.945 --> 28:15.747
You've got the wrong guy.
No, I don't think I do,

28:15.747 --> 28:17.015
lucky for you,
because, actually,

28:17.015 --> 28:18.483
I got a shot of you here
from the bus' security camera.

28:18.483 --> 28:19.951
And, uh, my friend
at the NSA can use that...

28:19.951 --> 28:22.954
What the hell
do you want, huh?

28:22.954 --> 28:25.524
I've got a class action lawsuit
with all the passengers.

28:25.524 --> 28:26.825
And all I want to do is make you

28:26.825 --> 28:29.694
a $40,000 to $50,000
cash settlement.

28:29.694 --> 28:30.962
I said I'm not interested.

28:30.962 --> 28:31.963
Okay.
Don't...

28:31.963 --> 28:33.398
make me say it again.

28:33.398 --> 28:34.432
Okay.

28:34.432 --> 28:36.034
Okay?
Check.

28:37.936 --> 28:40.372
Okay.

28:40.372 --> 28:42.307
That‐that is you, though.

28:44.309 --> 28:45.911
Hey, Sean, if you change
your mind...

28:47.045 --> 28:49.047
(engine starts)

28:57.989 --> 29:00.458
LLEWYN:
When I leave here, my first call

29:00.458 --> 29:01.526
will be to the mayor,
the governor,

29:01.526 --> 29:02.661
and the police commissioner.

29:02.661 --> 29:03.895
Then, that's three calls.

29:03.895 --> 29:05.397
(knocking on door)
Hey, hey. Hey.

29:05.397 --> 29:06.798
Let me out of here.
Hey.

29:06.798 --> 29:08.466
There was way less

29:08.466 --> 29:10.001
than $600,000 in that bag.

29:10.001 --> 29:11.870
So, either you were lying,

29:11.870 --> 29:14.539
or you thought these guys
just couldn't count.

29:14.539 --> 29:15.674
Which one?

29:15.674 --> 29:18.510
BAILEY:
Or you expect us to believe

29:18.510 --> 29:20.545
they threw her in a van
at gunpoint for 31 grand?

29:20.545 --> 29:21.680
MURTAUGH:
What did they want?

29:21.680 --> 29:22.747
What was in that bag?

29:25.317 --> 29:26.751
A truck route.

29:26.751 --> 29:27.919
The route,

29:27.919 --> 29:30.388
departure time,

29:30.388 --> 29:32.657
the ID number
for one of my trucks.

29:32.657 --> 29:34.926
Conlon Pharma makes
a decongestant

29:34.926 --> 29:36.761
that contains a compound...

29:36.761 --> 29:37.896
That makes meth.

29:37.896 --> 29:40.298
Riggs said the A. F. T. pipeline
just shut down.

29:40.298 --> 29:41.499
And they want
to hijack your truck

29:41.499 --> 29:43.435
so they can make their own.

29:43.435 --> 29:44.436
What truck?
No.

29:44.436 --> 29:45.704
You can't.

29:45.704 --> 29:47.973
They said they'd let go
of Lisa once they have it.

29:47.973 --> 29:49.541
Mr. Conlon,

29:49.541 --> 29:51.409
if you want to get Lisa back,

29:51.409 --> 29:54.012
then you have to tell us
what truck it is.

30:13.965 --> 30:16.468
(phone rings)

30:16.468 --> 30:19.838
Leo? This better not be
about your lawsuit.

30:19.838 --> 30:20.972
LEO:
Murtaugh,

30:20.972 --> 30:23.341
I found the 19th bus passenger
for my lawsuit.

30:23.341 --> 30:24.743
Okay, I'm hanging up.

30:24.743 --> 30:26.311
No, no, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

30:26.311 --> 30:27.612
Conlon Pharmaceuticals
beach bag.

30:27.612 --> 30:28.880
What?

30:28.880 --> 30:30.949
He's got a Conlon
Pharmaceuticals beach bag

30:30.949 --> 30:33.351
in his car.
I'm following him right now.

30:33.351 --> 30:35.587
A fairly unpleasant man
named Sean Banks.

30:35.587 --> 30:40.358
Okay. He must've been on the bus
monitoring the ransom drop.

30:40.358 --> 30:42.827
Okay, Leo?
I'm gonna regret saying this‐‐

30:42.827 --> 30:44.629
keep following that car.

30:44.629 --> 30:46.498
Does this mean you're
officially deputizing me?

30:46.498 --> 30:47.666
No.

30:47.666 --> 30:49.768
Uh, does it mean I can get
a bubble light for the car?

30:49.768 --> 30:51.369
No.

30:51.369 --> 30:52.771
If I have a bubble light,
can I use it?

30:52.771 --> 30:53.772
(phone beeps)

30:53.772 --> 30:56.341
Hello? Hello, hello?

31:16.898 --> 31:18.699
BAILEY: You sure
you need all of this?

31:18.699 --> 31:20.835
Mm, about
to find out.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.270
Got the grenades, too.

31:22.270 --> 31:24.171
Do you even know
what you're doing?

31:24.171 --> 31:26.140
So, two things.

31:26.140 --> 31:28.609
You requisitioned
the LAPD Ferrari?

31:28.609 --> 31:30.845
I thought you were making
that up. LAPD has a Ferrari?

31:30.845 --> 31:32.513
Yes, it does.
Second,

31:32.513 --> 31:34.315
the commission
is dumbstruck and furious,

31:34.315 --> 31:37.618
because you brought
Mark Conlon in.

31:37.618 --> 31:39.453
And it's a good thing
we did.

31:39.453 --> 31:41.622
Because now we know
why his wife was kidnapped.

31:41.622 --> 31:43.391
They're going
after his truck.

31:43.391 --> 31:44.792
So we need to get out...
Stop.

31:44.792 --> 31:47.828
Tell me you understand what
"The FBI is taking over" means.

31:47.828 --> 31:49.330
MURTAUGH: Listen,
you sent Riggs

31:49.330 --> 31:51.599
to find out
what his father knows.

31:51.599 --> 31:53.801
Well, here's what
he found out:

31:53.801 --> 31:55.469
these people,
they don't mess around.

31:55.469 --> 31:57.705
Once they know the truck
is clear, they're gonna make

31:57.705 --> 32:00.241
that one phone call,
and she will be dead.

32:00.241 --> 32:03.411
So if you want
Lisa back alive,

32:03.411 --> 32:06.247
let us do what we do.

32:16.524 --> 32:19.160
(siren wailing)

32:20.895 --> 32:22.663
(phone beeps)
Leo.

32:22.663 --> 32:23.698
Where are you now?

32:23.698 --> 32:25.266
Okay, I followed him

32:25.266 --> 32:29.270
into the Citrus Grove Motel
on Evans Road.

32:29.270 --> 32:32.606
There is a tiny bit of citrus,
and a very diminutive grove.

32:32.606 --> 32:34.642
Okay. Damn.

32:34.642 --> 32:36.410
He's stopping the car.

32:36.410 --> 32:38.279
Parking.

32:38.279 --> 32:39.647
Leo, we're ten minutes
away. Sit tight.

32:39.647 --> 32:41.449
Five. Remember
what you're driving?

32:41.449 --> 32:42.316
(engine roars)

32:42.316 --> 32:44.752
(siren wailing)

32:55.329 --> 32:57.331
LLEWYN:
<i>The truck is mine.</i>

32:57.331 --> 32:59.333
As soon as I tell you I'm in the
clear, take care of the girl.

32:59.333 --> 33:00.835
(phone beeps)

33:00.835 --> 33:02.737
MURTAUGH (on phone):
Leo, you still there?

33:02.737 --> 33:04.538
I'm gonna follow him, okay?

33:04.538 --> 33:07.308
No, Leo, get back in your car.

33:07.308 --> 33:09.677
Shelter in place.
Don't you worry about me.

33:09.677 --> 33:12.680
Leo Getz is a chameleon.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.682
I move like the night.

33:14.682 --> 33:16.817
And he's talking to somebody.

33:16.817 --> 33:18.586
Maybe he's heading
into a room.

33:18.586 --> 33:20.287
But I can't see what...
(gun cocks)

33:20.287 --> 33:22.323
Move and you're dead.

33:23.491 --> 33:24.592
Is this where
the Mendelbaum bris is?

33:24.592 --> 33:26.594
I'm looking for the bris.
I'm so... Okay.

33:26.594 --> 33:29.296
Okay, guy.
Okay. Okay.

33:42.510 --> 33:43.677
LEO:
<i>Easy, easy.</i>

33:43.677 --> 33:46.247
Easy, easy. Hey, hey, hey! Hey.

33:46.247 --> 33:48.582
Get up.
Get in there.
(screams)

33:48.582 --> 33:50.317
This is as fast
as I can go.

33:50.317 --> 33:53.320
Don't move.
It's cool, it's cool.

33:54.255 --> 33:55.923
(phone beeps)

33:55.923 --> 33:56.924
All good.

33:56.924 --> 33:58.492
All good.

33:58.492 --> 34:00.694
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

34:00.694 --> 34:03.397
Look, I don't know, okay?
It‐It's some lawyer.

34:03.397 --> 34:05.232
LLEWYN: You let a lawyer
follow you from Glendale?

34:05.232 --> 34:06.667
Who'd he call, the cops?

34:06.667 --> 34:08.669
SEAN: Look, who knows, okay?
All I know is

34:08.669 --> 34:10.104
I'm not sticking around here
to find out,

34:10.104 --> 34:11.138
so what do you want me
to do with them?

34:11.138 --> 34:12.540
I want you to take
the both of them

34:12.540 --> 34:14.442
out the back...
Hi!

34:16.377 --> 34:18.145
Hey, I didn't hear
what you said.

34:22.349 --> 34:23.551
(screams)

34:24.285 --> 34:25.753
(tires screeching)

34:26.821 --> 34:28.155
(horn honking)

34:28.155 --> 34:29.390
(yelling)

34:30.224 --> 34:31.625
(horn blares)

34:31.625 --> 34:33.194
Whoa.

34:42.703 --> 34:44.839
(tires screeching)

34:49.844 --> 34:51.445
(gunshots)

35:02.490 --> 35:04.358
(tires screeching)

35:08.496 --> 35:09.497
(yells)

35:09.497 --> 35:11.332
(tires screeching)

35:11.332 --> 35:12.399
(yelling)

35:28.415 --> 35:29.517
Hey.

35:30.518 --> 35:32.486
I just want to take a moment

35:32.486 --> 35:34.588
to tell you that this
is your last chance

35:34.588 --> 35:36.557
to join into an amazing
class action lawsuit.

35:36.557 --> 35:38.826
Okay? That is,
I guarantee,

35:38.826 --> 35:40.561
going to make you more
than you're making right now.

35:40.561 --> 35:42.496
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

36:05.753 --> 36:06.787
(grunts)

36:13.127 --> 36:16.130
Lisa Conlon,
are you okay?
LISA: I think so.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.531
BAILEY: All right, the EMTs
are on their way.

36:17.531 --> 36:18.799
I got your back, Murtaugh.

36:22.303 --> 36:23.437
Hey!

36:23.437 --> 36:25.239
Don't point it at me.
I found it fair
and square.

36:25.239 --> 36:29.243
Mrs. Conlon, you are a really
amazing, amazing hostage.

36:29.243 --> 36:31.111
If you got to be a
hostage with somebody,

36:31.111 --> 36:32.246
boom, this lady.

36:32.246 --> 36:34.281
Hostage numero uno.

36:34.281 --> 36:36.417
I'm gonna get you
a cash settlement,

36:36.417 --> 36:38.752
or at least, maybe, a couple
nights here at the hotel,

36:38.752 --> 36:40.120
(scoffs)
whatever...
whatever works out.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.423
Okay, thank you, Leo.
Are you okay?

36:43.424 --> 36:45.893
(groans)

37:03.077 --> 37:04.144
(spits)

37:12.753 --> 37:14.255
So what do we
do now, Martin?

37:17.491 --> 37:19.493
We got a car coming for you.

37:19.493 --> 37:21.695
Yeah, it's like an Uber,
only with handcuffs, so...

37:21.695 --> 37:26.300
You just sit there
and be quiet.

37:26.300 --> 37:29.670
You know he's
a dead man, right?

37:29.670 --> 37:32.239
Your dad.

37:32.239 --> 37:33.807
In jail, out of jail,
it doesn't matter,

37:33.807 --> 37:35.175
someone will get
close to him.

37:35.175 --> 37:38.812
As soon as I'm booked,
that's the first call I make.

37:38.812 --> 37:41.348
You see,
the thing is, Martin,

37:41.348 --> 37:43.684
doesn't have to be that way.

37:43.684 --> 37:47.454
You let me go, I guarantee
nobody touches him.

37:47.454 --> 37:50.791
Old Nathan gets
to live a long, long life.

37:54.161 --> 37:56.163
(chuckles)

37:56.163 --> 37:58.699
Oh.

37:58.699 --> 38:02.703
Maybe you don't want him
hanging around, huh? Is that it?

38:02.703 --> 38:05.372
I mean, who could blame you?

38:05.372 --> 38:07.141
Like I said,
I heard the stories.

38:07.141 --> 38:10.311
Oh, he was quite
a piece of work.

38:10.311 --> 38:13.314
You must carry
a lot of anger.

38:13.314 --> 38:15.082
Do you ever get rid of that?

38:24.458 --> 38:26.260
I don't think that car's
coming after all.

38:27.695 --> 38:28.796
No?

38:28.796 --> 38:31.298
No.

38:33.767 --> 38:35.669
Good luck.

39:02.963 --> 39:06.066
DEBRA: <i>Well, for the record,</i>
<i>I voted no.</i>

39:06.066 --> 39:09.536
That this committee would
offer you the actual,

39:09.536 --> 39:12.473
for‐real captain job is...
(laughs)

39:12.473 --> 39:15.175
Even you must admit
that that is insane.

39:15.175 --> 39:17.478
Captain Murtaugh, can you
at least please look at me

39:17.478 --> 39:20.614
while you gloat? No?

39:20.614 --> 39:23.050
Wait, did I
hear correctly?

39:23.050 --> 39:25.752
The commission is offering me
the captain position?

39:25.752 --> 39:27.688
Avery's job?

39:27.688 --> 39:28.755
Yup.

39:29.990 --> 39:33.060
Avery's continuing education
was actually him

39:33.060 --> 39:35.562
taking two days off
to interview campaign managers.

39:35.562 --> 39:37.498
Wait, Avery's
stepping down to...

39:37.498 --> 39:38.765
To run for office. Yes.

39:38.765 --> 39:41.068
And the plan was
to use his absence

39:41.068 --> 39:43.737
to quietly test drive
his replacement,

39:43.737 --> 39:46.173
and there were so, so many
better candidates.

39:46.173 --> 39:49.710
But you brought
Lisa Conlon back.

39:49.710 --> 39:52.079
And results are what matters
around here, so whatever.

39:54.081 --> 39:56.016
Congratulations.

40:06.426 --> 40:09.663
When does he get out?

40:09.663 --> 40:12.466
Uh... right about now.

40:12.466 --> 40:15.636
(door buzzing)
CAHILL: <i>You okay with it?</i>

40:15.636 --> 40:18.705
RIGGS: <i>If nothing else, the man</i>
<i>has survival instincts.</i>

40:18.705 --> 40:21.074
Trust me, he won't stick around.

40:21.074 --> 40:22.743
(door buzzing)
CAHILL: <i>Maybe.</i>

40:22.743 --> 40:24.645
<i>But on the other hand,</i>
<i>he's family.</i>

40:24.645 --> 40:26.480
<i>And family has a way</i>
<i>of surprising you.</i>

40:26.480 --> 40:31.218
♪ Don't know
what we should do ♪

40:31.218 --> 40:32.619
There she is.

40:32.619 --> 40:34.688
Baby, you wouldn't believe

40:34.688 --> 40:36.557
the day I had.
You and me both.

40:36.557 --> 40:37.824
I just want to
crawl into bed.

40:37.824 --> 40:39.193
They offered me
the captain's job.

40:39.193 --> 40:40.294
BOTH:
What?

40:40.294 --> 40:42.062
No, no, no. No.
Wait a minute,
no, hold....

40:42.062 --> 40:44.231
You first, you first.
They offered...

40:44.231 --> 40:48.235
Avery is leaving
to run for office,

40:48.235 --> 40:52.072
and the commission wants me
as RHD captain.

40:52.072 --> 40:54.241
Not interim, permanent.

40:54.241 --> 40:55.676
No.
Mm‐hmm.

40:55.676 --> 40:57.611
Honey, that's huge.
I know.

40:57.611 --> 40:58.679
What did you say?

40:58.679 --> 41:00.247
I didn't say
nothing yet.

41:00.247 --> 41:02.182
I wanted to talk
to Riggs and Avery

41:02.182 --> 41:04.184
and, of course,
I wanted to talk to you.

41:04.184 --> 41:08.455
I want to hear about
this whole captain

41:08.455 --> 41:11.625
thing, baby, come on!

41:11.625 --> 41:15.195
Like, who made the offer?
Are you thinking about it, baby?

41:15.195 --> 41:17.664
Tell me.
I think I'm
thinking about it.

41:17.664 --> 41:19.066
You should.

41:19.066 --> 41:20.267
I mean, it would be
a big change.

41:20.267 --> 41:22.736
Yeah.
But...

41:22.736 --> 41:24.271
maybe I'm ready for that.

41:24.271 --> 41:26.607
Mm‐hmm.

41:26.607 --> 41:28.108
And there's also the whole...
Oh.

41:28.108 --> 41:29.610
The people calling
you "Captain."

41:29.610 --> 41:32.746
Yeah, that thing,
you know what I'm saying.
Yes. (laughs)

41:32.746 --> 41:36.083
I do.
Of course, you and the kids

41:36.083 --> 41:38.085
will not have to
call me that.

41:38.085 --> 41:40.721
Except maybe, uh,
on the weekdays

41:40.721 --> 41:42.589
when it would be official.

41:42.589 --> 41:44.725
(laughs) Not a chance.

41:45.726 --> 41:47.494
Captain.

41:47.494 --> 41:49.496
See, see how good that sounds?

41:49.496 --> 41:51.632
(laughs)
I do. I'm so proud of you.

42:00.374 --> 42:02.376
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

42:18.191 --> 42:20.661
Hey, Junior.

42:22.729 --> 42:25.132
You, uh...

42:25.132 --> 42:26.600
You didn't want to come in?

42:31.371 --> 42:33.740
Looks like you got everything
under control in there.

42:34.775 --> 42:36.710
Well, in case
you're worried,

42:36.710 --> 42:39.079
the doctors say
he's out of the woods.

42:39.079 --> 42:41.148
Good.

42:41.148 --> 42:45.085
Give this one
a chance, okay?

42:45.085 --> 42:48.221
Look, son,

42:48.221 --> 42:52.426
I appreciate everything
you done for me.

42:52.426 --> 42:55.696
You went over
and above.

42:55.696 --> 42:58.632
Getting me out of prison,
taking care of Llewyn Cooke.

42:58.632 --> 43:02.703
It couldn't have gone better
if I'd planned it.

43:07.307 --> 43:08.442
Did you?

43:13.780 --> 43:16.516
I'll be seeing you, son.
