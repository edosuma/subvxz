00:55.355 --> 00:59.105
I'm a little busy myself.

01:00.694 --> 01:04.444
The ladies, they love me.

01:11.438 --> 01:15.788

what happened to Buttons?

02:25.246 --> 02:27.347
The cat,
a couple of streets over.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.183
He went off the deep end.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.718
The vet said it was a case of

02:31.785 --> 02:36.389
felis catus
indoorium delirium.

02:36.456 --> 02:39.126
Too much time indoors.

02:39.193 --> 02:42.229
It did the poor fella in.

02:42.296 --> 02:45.333
The very people we think
are our "friends"

02:55.609 --> 02:57.512
and watching nature channels,

02:57.578 --> 03:00.881
making us wear silly little
collars with bells on them.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.249
Like that one.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.352
So that they can always know
where we are.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.254
Buttons had a collar
just like it.

03:07.321 --> 03:10.991
-Right down
to the little bell.
-(GULPING)

03:11.058 --> 03:13.027
Don't look so worried.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.762
You and Buttons,
two different cats,

03:15.829 --> 03:17.898

all pale and stuff.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.268
(SCREAMING)

03:20.334 --> 03:24.372
So you're a little pale,
it's nothing.

03:24.439 --> 03:29.309
To make sure,
what do you say we do
some tests first?

03:29.376 --> 03:33.714
Say, "Ah."

03:37.985 --> 03:40.535
Ooh, don't panic.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.663
You're worse off
than I thought.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.133
We gotta get
your inner tiger back.

03:52.199 --> 03:56.571
Or else it's Buttons for you.

03:56.638 --> 04:00.207
All right, I hate to see
a grown cat cry.

04:00.274 --> 04:03.377
But it won't be easy
to get your inner tiger back.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.914
You'll have to do absolutely
everything I say.

04:06.981 --> 04:08.249
You hear?

04:08.316 --> 04:10.484
You've got to
catch your own eats,

04:10.550 --> 04:12.086
live on the streets,

04:12.153 --> 04:17.153
and find a feline companion
to make your life complete.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.561
You're not going
on spring break.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.897
You're reclaiming
your inner tiger, remember?

04:23.964 --> 04:26.133
You can do this, pal.
I know it.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.035
And don't you worry,

04:28.102 --> 04:30.771
I'll watch over the place,
while you're gone.

04:30.838 --> 04:34.541

No wonder you were so dirty.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.388
You haven't got a home.

Well, you do now.

where you are.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.095
I wonder where that Tom is.
