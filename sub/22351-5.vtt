to be evicted?

in my obey personal power to
make sure I win the veto to so I

00:39.990 --> 00:40.990
can save myself.

00:40.990 --> 00:44.990
>> James remained as sole power
as head of household.

00:44.990 --> 00:48.700
And his sites were set on a big
target.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.990
>> I'm locking in on a 12 point
buck and it's looking good.

00:51.990 --> 00:53.990
>> Numbers on his side.

00:53.990 --> 00:59.990

00:59.990 --> 01:06.990

into his alliance.

01:06.990 --> 01:10.410
Austin warned Jace he could be
in trouble.

>> So they formed an alliance
with James and Audrey.

01:15.990 --> 01:18.990
>> It's like us -- I got your
back.

01:18.990 --> 01:21.990
>> Jace had no idea he was being
played.

01:21.990 --> 01:25.990
>> Basically right now we just
need to tell him whatever it is

01:25.990 --> 01:26.990
he wants.

01:26.990 --> 01:30.990
>> After Da'vonne and chai had
a below up.

01:30.990 --> 01:31.990

>> I thought so too.

01:33.990 --> 01:36.990
>> Audrey tried to control the
situation.

01:36.990 --> 01:37.990
>> Don't apologize.

01:37.990 --> 01:38.990
She started crying.

01:38.990 --> 01:41.950
>> Announcer: But it to more
harm than good.

01:41.950 --> 01:44.990
>> I'm irritated with Audrey.

01:44.990 --> 01:49.000
He's trying to manipulate me
right now and you're trying to

01:49.000 --> 01:50.700
be the puppet master.

01:50.700 --> 01:55.950
>> As the first veto competition
of the summer, Steve picks

01:55.950 --> 01:55.990
something golden.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.540
>> I bon the veto.

01:57.540 --> 01:59.990
I'm stoked and that means I'm
not going to be the first person

01:59.990 --> 02:01.290
out of the game.

02:01.290 --> 02:07.000
>> Bored about alliance, after
this between day and Clay I feel

02:07.000 --> 02:09.990
like it's important to start
aligning with the truth.

02:09.990 --> 02:13.410
>> Audrey went rogue and pulled
in new members.

02:13.410 --> 02:17.990
>> I guess you're going to pick
and choose and do what you want

02:17.990 --> 02:18.990
gliesmtion question her motives.

02:18.990 --> 02:21.990
>> I'm having second thoughts
about Audrey.

02:21.990 --> 02:23.410
Who do you think is head of
household.

02:23.410 --> 02:26.990
>> At the veto meeting --
I decided to use the power of

02:26.990 --> 02:29.990
veto to save myself.

02:29.990 --> 02:31.990
>> Announcer: James stuck to his
guns.

the front door.

[ Applause ]

03:37.990 --> 03:40.990
>> Julie: Good evening.

03:40.990 --> 03:41.990
I'm Julie chen.

03:41.990 --> 03:42.990
Welcome to "Big Brother."

03:42.990 --> 03:46.290
It's been a week one like we
have never seen before.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.830
Everyone is playing the game
hard.

03:48.830 --> 03:51.990
But are they playing the game a
little too hard?

03:51.990 --> 03:52.990
We will soon find out.

03:52.990 --> 03:58.830
But first, the plan to back door
Jace has been in place since day

03:58.830 --> 03:59.990
one.

03:59.990 --> 04:05.990
But would alliances fracture his
ultimate faith, it's still in

04:05.990 --> 04:13.990
question.

04:13.990 --> 04:17.990
>> I feel really good about my
nomination.

04:17.990 --> 04:18.990
I put up a big player.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.990
I made a big move.

04:20.990 --> 04:23.990
And I'm not scared to get blood
on my hands.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.120
That's what I'm here for.

04:25.120 --> 04:29.290
>> Even though I'm on the block,
things are going great.

04:29.290 --> 04:32.990
Jace is a bigger target than I
will ever be so my plan for the

04:32.990 --> 04:35.990
rest of the week is to be as
chill as possible and not cause

04:35.990 --> 04:43.990
any drama.

04:50.990 --> 04:58.990
>>
>> things couldn't have gone

05:01.540 --> 05:02.830
better.

05:02.830 --> 05:05.990
However, I have a gut feeling
he's about to go off.

05:05.990 --> 05:11.290
>> I have competed against some
of the best skateboarders in the

05:11.290 --> 05:15.290
world, I have snowboarded down
the tallest mountains and this

05:15.290 --> 05:16.990
is scarier.

05:16.990 --> 05:20.990
Everyone was afraid when y2k was
happening?

05:20.990 --> 05:25.120
This is worse!

05:25.120 --> 05:26.990
>> He is explosive right now.

05:26.990 --> 05:29.990
>> I don't know what the deal is
with Audrey and James.

05:29.990 --> 05:34.290
The last time we spoke we were
all in an alliance together so

05:34.290 --> 05:37.990
something fish gee going on and
I have to make sure that I'm not

05:37.990 --> 05:38.990
the next target.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.990
>> I just thought there were a
few people I could trust more

05:41.990 --> 05:42.990
than I could.

05:42.990 --> 05:47.990
I mean I just didn't expect to
get blindsided and upset and

05:47.990 --> 05:51.990
frustrated in the first week of
the game.

05:51.990 --> 05:59.990
>> It's going to be a long
couple of days.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.990
>> (Knocking on door).

06:01.990 --> 06:02.990
>> Yeah?

06:02.990 --> 06:04.990
>> Can I speak to you for a
minute?

06:04.990 --> 06:05.990
>> Yeah!

06:05.990 --> 06:05.990
Hello?

06:05.990 --> 06:10.990
>> Thank you.

06:10.990 --> 06:13.990
>> This just doesn't make any
sense to me, bro?

06:13.990 --> 06:18.990
>> From a game standpoint I
respect you as a person but

06:18.990 --> 06:19.990
strategically I don't want to
compete with you.

06:19.990 --> 06:21.990
>> It's nothing personal.

06:21.990 --> 06:25.990
To be honest with you, it's not
personal considering you had

06:25.990 --> 06:27.830
alliances and said I was good.

06:27.830 --> 06:27.990
I don't understand.

06:27.990 --> 06:30.990
>> You almost beat me in hoh.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.990
Sorry, man.

06:33.990 --> 06:34.990
Don't take it personal.

06:34.990 --> 06:37.830
>> It is personal, Jace.

06:37.830 --> 06:38.990
>> In front of the whole house.

06:38.990 --> 06:41.990
>> Do you know what game this
is?

06:41.990 --> 06:42.990
>> It suction.

06:42.990 --> 06:43.120
>> I'm sorry.

06:43.120 --> 06:46.950
>> You're not sorry at all,
James.

06:46.950 --> 06:47.990
You're full and it suction.

06:47.990 --> 06:55.990
I put my faith in you for
absolutely nothing.

07:00.990 --> 07:04.830
>> Can we talk?

07:04.830 --> 07:08.120
>> Sure.

07:08.120 --> 07:12.990
>> I'm just telling you to your
face, swear to God, that I had

07:12.990 --> 07:16.990
nothing to do with this.

07:16.990 --> 07:19.540
You are --
>> look at me.

07:19.540 --> 07:19.990
Stop.

07:19.990 --> 07:20.990
You are always talking.

07:20.990 --> 07:21.990
Give me a second.

07:21.990 --> 07:24.990
I just ended up on the block and
I was supposed to be in an

07:24.990 --> 07:25.990
alliance with you and James.

07:25.990 --> 07:29.990
I trusted you and you betrayed
me.

07:29.990 --> 07:32.990
It suction because I thought you
liked me and I like you too.

07:32.990 --> 07:34.990
>> Here is the thing.

07:34.990 --> 07:35.990
That's how you feel.

07:35.990 --> 07:36.990
I have a clean conscious.

07:36.990 --> 07:40.990
>> If you can do things that are
that dirty and have a clean

07:40.990 --> 07:42.540
conscious then power to you.

07:42.540 --> 07:47.990
If you can still here and still
play this manipulative game with

07:47.990 --> 07:52.990
me is really annoying and I hope
to God if I go home, the house

07:52.990 --> 07:57.990
figures it out until you chomp
them all off and you win the

07:57.990 --> 08:01.990
game.

08:01.990 --> 08:03.540
>> I'm not going home.

08:03.540 --> 08:03.990
>> I'm not.

08:03.990 --> 08:06.990
>>
>> at this point I'm just pissed

08:06.990 --> 08:07.990
off.

08:07.990 --> 08:08.990
I'm not going out without a
fight.

08:08.990 --> 08:09.990
I got the ball.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.540
I'm chucking it to the other end
of the field and I'm hoping that

08:12.540 --> 08:13.990
one of my players will catch it.

08:13.990 --> 08:15.990
>> I tell you right now I'm
ready to fight.

08:15.990 --> 08:17.990
I'm a warrior!

08:17.990 --> 08:20.990
We have to start an underground
movement right now.

08:20.990 --> 08:23.950
>> I'm not going home on the
first week.

08:23.950 --> 08:25.120
I'm going to change it up.

08:25.120 --> 08:33.990
>> I had your back forever.

08:33.990 --> 08:38.120
>> So I don't know what I did to
deserve this but I would like to

08:38.120 --> 08:40.830
pull myself out of this hole.

08:40.830 --> 08:44.120
What I'm saying is if I stay
here you will go a lot further

08:44.120 --> 08:46.990
in which case you're ok and
that's the thing you need to

08:46.990 --> 08:47.990
think about.

08:47.990 --> 08:49.990
>> Listen I'm on board with
everything you say.

08:49.990 --> 08:50.990
I'm telling you this.

08:50.990 --> 08:54.990
I will do what I can to keep you
here without jeopardizing my

08:54.990 --> 08:55.990
game.

08:55.990 --> 08:58.990
>> You know I like Jace but his
ship has kind of sailed.

08:58.990 --> 09:00.990
The plan is to get him out of
the house.

09:00.990 --> 09:04.990
>> Here is the deal, I could use
your vote.

09:04.990 --> 09:09.990
>> I'm I'm always going to be on
people's radar.

09:09.990 --> 09:13.120
Jackie what does she bring to
the table?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.830
What is she bringing?

09:15.830 --> 09:15.990
>> I don't know.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.990
>> Boobs.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.990
Ok?

09:21.990 --> 09:21.990
Boobs.

09:21.990 --> 09:28.990
>> Yeah.

09:28.990 --> 09:31.990
>>
>> seriously, if I can get the

09:35.990 --> 09:37.990
votes would you help me?

09:37.990 --> 09:38.990
>> Yes.

09:38.990 --> 09:40.540
>> I need your word.

09:40.540 --> 09:40.990
>> Ok.

09:40.990 --> 09:41.990
>> Do I have your word?

09:41.990 --> 09:42.990
>> Ok.

09:42.990 --> 09:46.990
>> I'm on my last, last breath
in this house.

09:46.990 --> 09:48.830
I'm choking.

09:48.830 --> 09:48.990
I'm drowning.

09:48.990 --> 09:49.950
>> Ok.

09:49.950 --> 09:50.990
>> You need me.

09:50.990 --> 09:51.990
>> I know.

09:51.990 --> 09:56.990
>> My weaknesses are your
strengths and my strengths are

09:56.990 --> 09:57.700
your weaknesses.

09:57.700 --> 09:58.990
You need to remember that.

09:58.990 --> 10:00.950
>> I know.

10:00.950 --> 10:04.290
>> Don't just know you're my boy
and I will carry you with me all

10:04.290 --> 10:04.990
the way.

10:04.990 --> 10:04.990
>> I know.

10:04.990 --> 10:05.990
>> I really need you.

10:05.990 --> 10:06.990
>> I know.

10:06.990 --> 10:07.990
I need you too.

10:07.990 --> 10:11.990
>> As crazy and unpredictable as
Jace has been I know he is going

10:11.990 --> 10:14.990
to be on my side and if he wins
head of household he is not

10:14.990 --> 10:19.990
going to put me up but I oan't
fathom how he is going to get

10:19.990 --> 10:21.990
seven votes.

10:21.990 --> 10:24.700
>> Thank you.

10:24.700 --> 10:27.990
>>
>> what's going on, sir?

10:27.990 --> 10:32.990
>> Well, will you save me
please?

10:32.990 --> 10:34.990
I will be forever indebted to
you.

10:34.990 --> 10:38.700
I just hope some of you will see
that and I think I could be

10:38.700 --> 10:42.990
beneficial in the long run.

10:42.990 --> 10:49.990
>> Guys, I'm out of here.

10:49.990 --> 10:57.990
>> I want to loosen up.

10:57.990 --> 11:02.990
>> I want to ask you something.

11:02.990 --> 11:03.990
>>
>> I'm just so annoyed with it.

11:06.990 --> 11:10.990
>> Audrey, everything is going
according to plan.

11:10.990 --> 11:17.990
If it's not broke, don't fix it.

11:17.990 --> 11:24.990
>> I just like I wanted to
talk -- I feel like there's an

11:24.990 --> 11:26.990
uncomfortable elephant in the
room and I want to be direct

11:26.990 --> 11:26.990
about it.

11:26.990 --> 11:27.990
>> What?

11:27.990 --> 11:31.990
>> The whole house knew about
the idea about you.

11:31.990 --> 11:33.290
>> I don't believe that for one
second.

11:33.290 --> 11:37.290
I do believe you are the reason
I'm going if I do know and I

11:37.290 --> 11:39.990
will make the whole house know
Audrey.

11:39.990 --> 11:43.990
>> Everybody wants you out
because you make people feel

11:43.990 --> 11:44.990
uncomfortable.

11:44.990 --> 11:46.990
>> I'm curious have I made you
feel uncomfortable.

11:46.990 --> 11:50.540
>> Jace, everyone knew you were
trying to back door Jason.

11:50.540 --> 11:51.700
He knew about it.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.990
>> You know I was never trying
to back door Jason.

11:54.990 --> 11:56.990
It was never my idea.

11:56.990 --> 11:57.990
>> Whose idea was it?

11:57.990 --> 11:59.120
>> It wasn't mine.

11:59.120 --> 11:59.990
You know that.

11:59.990 --> 12:02.990
>>.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.830
>> Oh, my God.

12:04.830 --> 12:06.990
>> You are a master manipulator.

12:06.990 --> 12:07.990
>> What did you do?

12:07.990 --> 12:09.990
>> You did everything Audrey.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.700
Listen, guess what?

12:11.700 --> 12:14.990
You're still sitting here lying
to everybody, trying to make it

12:14.990 --> 12:16.990
seem like you're not the bad
person.

12:16.990 --> 12:17.990
>> You sound crazy.

12:17.990 --> 12:19.700
You need to get your head
checked.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.000
>> I need to get my head
checked?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.830
>> Yes.

12:22.830 --> 12:25.540
>> You are flipping out now
because you're the next target.

12:25.540 --> 12:27.990
And guess what, it hurts?

12:27.990 --> 12:28.990
How scary is that?

12:28.990 --> 12:32.540
>> Oh, my gosh, I'm telling you
this because I really feel bad

12:32.540 --> 12:32.990
for you.

12:32.990 --> 12:34.990
>> Just get out of here.

12:34.990 --> 12:35.990
No one wants to talk to you.

12:35.990 --> 12:37.990
>> Audrey, watch out.

12:37.990 --> 12:41.990
This could go down forever as
one of the most legendary come

12:41.990 --> 12:42.410
backs of all time.

12:42.410 --> 12:45.990
>> Rue you are the next one to
go.

12:45.990 --> 12:50.540
If I don't go home you're going
to go.

12:50.540 --> 12:51.990
>> You're going home.

12:51.990 --> 12:57.290
>> Up next, Jackie or Jace, who
will be the first houseguest to

12:57.290 --> 13:01.990
be sent packing? And we will
reveal the identity of the twins

13:01.990 --> 13:05.990
that have been secretly playing
as one.

13:05.990 --> 13:10.990
And then time for a bb takeover
as super fan Kathy Griffin joins

13:10.990 --> 13:12.410
me to twist up the game.

13:12.410 --> 13:15.990
Once again we will be putting
your tweets out live all summer

13:15.990 --> 13:16.990
long.

13:16.990 --> 13:19.990
Tell us what you're thinking at
#bb17.

13:19.990 --> 13:20.990
Stay with us.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.990
[ Applause ]
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big

13:42.990 --> 13:43.990
brother."

13:43.990 --> 13:46.990
For the past week a pair of
identical twins has been

13:46.990 --> 13:48.990
secretly playing the game as
one.

13:48.990 --> 13:52.990
If they can survive five
evictions they will both enter

13:52.990 --> 13:56.540
the game and play as individual
houseguests.

13:56.540 --> 14:00.990
So far they have switched places
four times and no one suspects a

14:00.990 --> 14:01.990
thing.

14:01.990 --> 14:03.990
So have you figured out who the
twins are?

14:03.990 --> 14:11.990
It's time to find out!

14:11.990 --> 14:15.830
>> Oh, my God!

14:15.830 --> 14:18.990
I'm going to cry.

14:18.990 --> 14:23.990
>> Audrey, she hooks amazing,
she is one of my best friends.

14:23.990 --> 14:29.950
I'm not hitting it off with any
of the guys: That guy Steve and

14:29.950 --> 14:34.990
this guy John, the dentist --
>> don't do that.

14:34.990 --> 14:39.990
>> He walked me into the house
for the first time and it's

14:39.990 --> 14:42.990
extremely nerve-wracking.

14:42.990 --> 14:46.990
All of the things my sister
already experienced I'm having

14:46.990 --> 14:48.120
to feel it out for the first
time.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.990
>> Hey.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.990
Hey, what is it?

14:52.990 --> 14:59.290
>>
>> they are like growing in to

14:59.290 --> 15:00.540
me.

15:00.540 --> 15:03.990
>> Do they know that I'm not,
like the real Liz?

15:03.990 --> 15:05.700
I'm kind of freaking out.

15:05.700 --> 15:13.700
What are they thinking.

15:15.990 --> 15:19.990
>> I love James -- the hoh.

15:19.990 --> 15:24.990
>> My lips are so chapped.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.990
>> Oh, my God, Jackie, you
scared me.

15:26.990 --> 15:32.410
>> So when my twin and I switch,
we only have 10 or 15 minutes to

15:32.410 --> 15:34.990
download each other on what has
been going on in the bb house.

15:34.990 --> 15:38.990
>> Ok.

15:38.990 --> 15:45.830
So Jackie and Steve lost the
battle of the --

15:45.830 --> 15:51.990
>> it's important for us to be
in synch otherwise, people can

15:51.990 --> 15:53.000
be on to us.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.990
>> I think someone is posing a
as twin.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.990
>> Oh, you're a twin, too.

15:58.990 --> 15:59.830
>> Yes.

15:59.830 --> 16:00.990
>> What's your brother's name.

16:00.990 --> 16:03.990
>> Eric.

16:03.990 --> 16:05.990
>> Did you ever a brother?

16:05.990 --> 16:06.990
>> No.

16:06.990 --> 16:08.990
>> Just a little sister.

16:08.990 --> 16:16.990
>> I know what is going to
happen because everyone volume

16:19.290 --> 16:20.990
teared --
>> you haven't told me about

16:20.990 --> 16:21.990
your sister.

16:21.990 --> 16:28.990
>> My older sister has huge
lips, like Angelina Jolie lips.

16:28.990 --> 16:31.990
>> Duh, like it's not already
obvious.

16:31.990 --> 16:35.990
>> So Liz is playing the game
with her identical twin Julia,

16:35.990 --> 16:39.950
and tonight they will make "big
brother" history when together

16:39.950 --> 16:44.990
they cast a single vote to evict
and then swap places live.

16:44.990 --> 16:47.990
Let's head to the living room
for the first eviction of the

16:47.990 --> 16:51.540
summer.

16:51.540 --> 16:52.290
Hello houseguest?

16:52.290 --> 16:53.990
>> Hi.

16:53.990 --> 16:57.990
>> All right, everyone, it's now
time for the first live vote and

16:57.990 --> 16:59.410
eviction of the summer.

16:59.410 --> 17:03.990
Jackie, Jace, in just moments
your housemates will cast their

17:03.990 --> 17:04.990
vote to evict live.

17:04.990 --> 17:09.990
But before they do I will give
you each a final chance to sway

17:09.990 --> 17:13.990
their votes with one brief
statement.

17:13.990 --> 17:14.700
Jackie, you're first.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.990
>> Houseguests, I love you all.

17:17.990 --> 17:21.990
What a crazy week in the "big
brother" house and way to hit it

17:21.990 --> 17:22.990
off.

17:22.990 --> 17:24.990
I just want to say, keep me
here.

17:24.990 --> 17:28.830
I have so much love, light and
laughter to give to you guys.

17:28.830 --> 17:31.990
I hope me being on the block has
shown my dedication and love for

17:31.990 --> 17:32.990
the game.

17:32.990 --> 17:35.990
Just go in there and make the
right decision and I hope to see

17:35.990 --> 17:36.700
you afterwards.

17:36.700 --> 17:37.990
I love you guys so much.

17:37.990 --> 17:38.990
>> Jaw, Jackie.

17:38.990 --> 17:39.990
>> Jace?

17:39.990 --> 17:47.990
>> First to all of my
senators@lapoe and my music page

17:47.990 --> 17:48.990

17:48.990 --> 17:50.990
I know it's been a crazy intense
week.

17:50.990 --> 17:53.990
I'm sorry for a lot of things
that went down.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.990
I feel fully betrayed from the
alliance that put me on the

17:56.990 --> 17:57.990
block.

17:57.990 --> 18:00.990
I know there was a plan to take
me down and kick me through the

18:00.990 --> 18:06.990
back door from day two and that
sucks and I appreciated you

18:06.990 --> 18:07.990
people including James.

18:07.990 --> 18:10.990
You tricked me and the that is a
wonderful play.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.540
You're getting out a strong
player.

18:12.540 --> 18:13.990
Good job.

18:13.990 --> 18:15.990
But at the same time I would
like you to potential keep me in

18:15.990 --> 18:18.990
the house and I know you have
made your decision but I love

18:18.990 --> 18:22.950
you all and it's been a
wonderful 15 days.

18:22.950 --> 18:23.990
Julie, you're so gorgeous.

18:23.990 --> 18:25.290
>> Julie: Thank you both.

It's now time for the live
voting to begin.

18:27.990 --> 18:29.990

allowed to vote.

18:29.990 --> 18:31.990
Neither are the two nominees.

18:31.990 --> 18:35.950
One at a time, the rest of you
will enter the diary room and

18:35.950 --> 18:37.990

19:09.990 --> 19:14.990

24:20.990 --> 24:24.990
When I reveal the vote, the
evicted houseguest will have

24:24.990 --> 24:28.990
just a few moments to say
goodbye, gather his or her

24:28.990 --> 24:32.990
belongings and walk out the
front door.

24:32.990 --> 24:37.990
With 12 votes to evict, Jace,
you are evicted from the "big

24:37.990 --> 24:39.410
brother" house.

24:39.410 --> 24:41.950
>> I will miss you all.

24:41.950 --> 24:50.700
I really am.

24:50.700 --> 24:51.990
As many as I can.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.120
Sorry, guys.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.990
Sorry for everything.

24:54.990 --> 24:56.990
Low love you all.

24:56.990 --> 25:00.990
Trying to get everybody n you're
all amazing people.

25:00.990 --> 25:01.990
You're wonderful.

25:01.990 --> 25:07.990
Love you so much.

25:07.990 --> 25:11.990
See you later!

Frankie.

Listen, Frankie --
>> wow, wow, wow!

25:37.830 --> 25:39.990
>> That was quick.

25:39.990 --> 25:41.830
>> Oh, my God.

25:41.830 --> 25:43.990
>> So fast.

25:43.990 --> 25:45.990
>> Thank you, guys.

25:45.990 --> 25:46.990
I love you guys.

26:03.410 --> 26:07.990
>> Julie: Let's talk about the
outcome.

26:07.990 --> 26:08.950
12-1.

26:08.950 --> 26:09.990
Who do you think gave you the
one vote to say.

26:09.990 --> 26:12.990
>> It's hard to say because that
person could have just been

26:12.990 --> 26:15.990
trying to make it seem like it
was one of my friends.

26:15.990 --> 26:18.990
I told my friends not vote for
me simply because I don't want

26:18.990 --> 26:19.990
them to go down with me.

26:19.990 --> 26:22.830
As you have seen it was a tough
battle for me.

26:22.830 --> 26:23.990
The whole house was against me.

26:23.990 --> 26:24.990
And it's ok.

26:24.990 --> 26:28.990
I kind of taking it as a
compliment because I came in a

26:28.990 --> 26:32.990
little too strong and maybe I
should have come in and not been

26:32.990 --> 26:33.990
myself but that's not Jace.

26:33.990 --> 26:36.990
I am myself and I hope you guys
to see that.

26:36.990 --> 26:39.990
>> So do you want to guess who
that one vote was.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.120
>> Could have been Audrey.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.990
I know it wasn't Austin or Liz.

26:43.990 --> 26:44.990
>> It was Audrey.

26:44.990 --> 26:45.540
>> I figured.

26:45.540 --> 26:46.990
>> Why do you think she did
that.

26:46.990 --> 26:48.990
>> She's in a tight position.

26:48.990 --> 26:53.830
She's a sweet girl, doing such a
wonderful thing for the

26:53.830 --> 26:55.990
transgender community and I'm
proud of her and she's trying to

26:55.990 --> 26:55.990
save herself.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.410
She say a wonderful person.

26:57.410 --> 27:00.990
You may have seen me yell at her
but I love her and I love

27:00.990 --> 27:02.120
everyone in the house.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.990
>> In the event you were the one
that was evicted your house

27:05.990 --> 27:07.990
taped goodbye messages.

27:07.990 --> 27:08.990
>> Ok.

27:08.990 --> 27:11.990
>> Jace, I am not that sorry to
see you go because this week you

27:11.990 --> 27:15.950
proved that you are a ticking
time bomb and everyone was

27:15.950 --> 27:18.830
waiting for you to explode which
you did.

27:18.830 --> 27:19.990
See you never.

27:19.990 --> 27:22.990
>> Jace, I'm sorry you're
sitting in this position and I

27:22.990 --> 27:26.120
wanted to may this game working
with you but with the whole

27:26.120 --> 27:31.290
house against you there wouldn't
anything do I to protect you.

27:31.290 --> 27:35.990
>> Don't step on mama day toe's.

27:35.990 --> 27:38.000
But what you can do is go home.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.990
Bye.

27:39.990 --> 27:42.990
>> You're my bro and I hope you
know if I stay long in the game

27:42.990 --> 27:44.700
I'm fighting for your honor.

27:44.700 --> 27:48.410
You're the man and this is for
you.

27:48.410 --> 27:49.990
Man.

27:49.990 --> 27:50.990
(Musical tone).

27:50.990 --> 27:52.990
>> You and the others know about
the bb takeover twist.

>> What you had don't know is
that there's another secret

27:55.990 --> 27:57.990
twist happening in the house.

27:57.990 --> 27:58.990
Continue to look over there.

>> And I'm Julia and we're of

forth in the house this entire

28:09.990 --> 28:10.990
time.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.990
>> Jace, I loved hanging out
with you.

28:12.990 --> 28:14.990
>> I loved hanging out with you
better.

28:14.990 --> 28:17.990
>> We will see you on the
outside!

28:17.990 --> 28:18.990
>> Oh, man.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.990
>> You're kidding me!

28:20.990 --> 28:24.990
>> Clearly you had no idea?

28:24.990 --> 28:25.990
>> What?

28:25.990 --> 28:27.990
>> Now you know the truth.

28:27.990 --> 28:28.990
No signs of anything odd?

28:28.990 --> 28:30.990
>> They're good.

28:30.990 --> 28:33.700
And they're also very gorgeous.

them --

>> which one?

28:37.990 --> 28:38.990
I don't know.

28:38.990 --> 28:40.830
>> Someone had to be the first
to go.

rocked the house and I warned
the houseguest it could happen

at any moment.

Well, that moment has come.

summer to take over the game.

29:44.990 --> 29:47.990
You will find out about my
takeover soon enough.

But right now I desperately need
your help.

house together.

>> What do you think of this
summer's houseguest?

31:55.700 --> 31:58.990
>> First of all they have to
keep these alliances secret.

31:58.990 --> 32:03.990
They can't be telling everybody,
I'm probably going to back door

32:03.990 --> 32:04.990
you.

32:04.990 --> 32:08.990
There was an original alliance
where Audrey, shelli and

32:08.990 --> 32:11.990
Da'vonne, if they could have
just kept that to the end but

32:11.990 --> 32:14.990
they are switching alliances and
tell everybody.

32:14.990 --> 32:19.990
>> They wanted a girl power
thing and didn't want the guys

32:19.990 --> 32:20.990
running the house.

>> I want the girls to win but
it girls don't have to meltdown

32:26.700 --> 32:27.410
every second.

32:27.410 --> 32:29.990
>> And what about this eight
person alliance.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.120
>> Too many.

32:31.120 --> 32:34.000
And now it's a nine or 10 person
alliance so you have to keep it

32:34.000 --> 32:34.990
secret.

>> Are you secretly rooting for
anyone?

Who do you like.

32:37.990 --> 32:41.990
>> Of course I like Audrey and I
want her to win but she has to

32:41.990 --> 32:41.990
stop melting down.

32:41.990 --> 32:44.990
She has to get out of bed.

32:44.990 --> 32:47.990
And I like Da'vonne but she
start add fight which you don't

32:47.990 --> 32:48.990
dot first week.

32:48.990 --> 32:53.990
I'm kind of liking Vanessa and I
hope she keeps her vocation a

32:53.990 --> 32:57.290
secret which is that she's a
professional poker player and

32:57.290 --> 32:58.990
that would be smart if she could
not tell everybody.

32:58.990 --> 33:02.990
>> You are here at this week's
bb takeover twist.

33:02.990 --> 33:04.950
>> I'm excited.

you have in store for the

33:07.990 --> 33:08.990
houseguests?

33:08.990 --> 33:11.990
>> So I will be surprising the
houseguests throughout the week.

33:11.990 --> 33:16.290
But my big twist is all about
giving someone the power of the

33:16.290 --> 33:20.410
last laugh, something I have
enjoyed my whole career, jewel

33:20.410 --> 33:20.990
yeel.

33:20.990 --> 33:21.990
Here is how it works.

33:21.990 --> 33:23.990
This week, a telephone will
appear in the house.

33:23.990 --> 33:25.990
And I'll be calling the
houseguests myself.

33:25.990 --> 33:30.990
So the person who answers the
7th call will receive the

33:30.990 --> 33:35.990
power to keep three people from
voting at next week's live

33:35.990 --> 33:36.830
eviction.

33:36.830 --> 33:36.990
This could be huge.

33:36.990 --> 33:39.990
>> I'll say so!

33:39.990 --> 33:40.990
It sounds really exciting.

get things started.

34:08.990 --> 34:11.990
Houseguests, the power is up for
grabs.

34:11.990 --> 34:14.990
James, as outgoing head of
household, you are not eligible

34:14.990 --> 34:16.700
to compete.

34:16.700 --> 34:19.990
This competition will be played
in two rounds.

34:19.990 --> 34:23.990
Having been determined by a
random draw, half of you will

34:23.990 --> 34:26.990
compete in this first round.

34:26.990 --> 34:29.700
The other half will compete in
round two.

34:29.700 --> 34:33.990
The winner of each round will
become a head of household for

34:33.990 --> 34:36.830

Everyone please listen closely
as I will only give you the

34:40.290 --> 34:42.990
rules to this competition once.

As you know, redheaded Kathy
Griffin is spearheading the next

34:47.990 --> 34:52.990
bb takeover and and that's why
we're calling this competition

34:52.990 --> 34:54.990
"ginger fever."

34:54.990 --> 34:59.120
The bill beard for Kathy's new
melodrama, ginger fever, was

34:59.120 --> 35:00.990
just released.

35:00.990 --> 35:01.990
Guess what?

35:01.990 --> 35:02.990
She hates it.

35:02.990 --> 35:07.990
Your job is to help her out by
assembling a new billboard.

35:07.990 --> 35:12.990
On my go, each player must fetch
their puzzle pieces one at a

35:12.990 --> 35:17.000
time from their bins and
assemble the new bill bored at

35:17.000 --> 35:18.410
their station.

35:18.410 --> 35:22.990
The first houseguest to
successfully assemble the new

35:22.990 --> 35:26.990
billboard, run across the yard,
hit their buzzer will be the

35:26.990 --> 35:28.990
first hoh of the week.

>> Yes.

>> Excellent.

35:33.990 --> 35:36.990

remain in power come eviction
night.

41:04.990 --> 41:08.990
