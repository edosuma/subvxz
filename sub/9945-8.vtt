WEBVTT

00:05.651 --> 00:08.431
[music playing]

00:08.535 --> 00:11.940
Tickets this way for the Chatsworth Express.

00:12.044 --> 00:16.526
Come and watch Pikeys making a mess of our lives

00:16.629 --> 00:19.826
they were given by him upstairs.

00:19.930 --> 00:23.475
And kids they're convinced aren't actually theirs.

00:23.579 --> 00:28.268
What sounds on earth could ever replace kids needing

00:28.373 --> 00:30.597
money and wives in your face.

00:30.701 --> 00:33.550
Because this, people reckon, and me included,

00:33.654 --> 00:38.518
is why pubs and drugs were kindly invented--

00:38.622 --> 00:40.984
to calm us all down.

00:41.088 --> 00:42.896
Stop us going mental.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.170
These are Chatsworth Estate's basic essentials.

00:47.273 --> 00:51.789
We are worth every penny for grinding your axes.

00:51.893 --> 00:56.098
You shit on our heads, but you pay taxes.

00:59.989 --> 01:03.984
Imagine a Britain without Chatsworth buccaneers,

01:04.089 --> 01:06.486
who'll come on your face for the price of a beer.

01:06.590 --> 01:08.779
Make poverty history.

01:08.883 --> 01:10.828
Cheaper drugs now.

01:10.932 --> 01:13.643
Make poverty history.

01:13.747 --> 01:17.256
Cheaper drugs now.

01:17.360 --> 01:18.820
Scatter.

01:18.924 --> 01:19.793
Party.

01:27.055 --> 01:29.173
MIMI MAGUIRE (VOICEOVER): My granddad used to keep pigeons.

01:32.404 --> 01:34.975
Flying rats, me ma called them.

01:35.079 --> 01:36.573
Kept threatening to torch the cage

01:36.677 --> 01:40.639
because she was sick of cleaning up shit in the yard.

01:40.743 --> 01:42.827
[screams] But I loved them.

01:42.931 --> 01:44.425
They could get whatever they wanted,

01:44.529 --> 01:46.336
as far as they could be asked to fly.

01:53.006 --> 01:54.987
And at the end of the day, they always came out.

01:57.975 --> 01:59.538
One of these pigeons was a right a little

01:59.642 --> 02:03.985
scully that would fly off in a straight line and keep going.

02:04.090 --> 02:06.105
The number of times Grandad caught the train

02:06.210 --> 02:08.398
down south to pick him up--

02:08.502 --> 02:11.768
Trouble is, even family can stray too far.

02:14.965 --> 02:16.355
[yells]

02:16.459 --> 02:24.901
[screams]

02:25.006 --> 02:25.873
Fuck.

02:28.306 --> 02:30.772
PADDY: Easy mistake, granted, but the last time

02:30.876 --> 02:32.961
you clowns make it.

02:33.065 --> 02:34.525
Go on. Get.

02:34.629 --> 02:35.463
Come on.

02:38.277 --> 02:40.015
You smell of piss.

02:47.797 --> 02:50.611
Where the fuck have you been?

02:50.715 --> 02:51.548
It's a long story.

02:54.537 --> 02:56.310
Look at the state of you.

02:56.414 --> 03:00.895
Have you any idea how worried I was?

03:00.999 --> 03:03.362
Not one fucking phone call.

03:06.141 --> 03:07.565
It was out of my control.

03:12.916 --> 03:18.926
I thought you were dead or gone.

03:23.999 --> 03:25.562
You should know better than that.

03:29.906 --> 03:32.546
I want every fucking detail, Paddy.

03:38.035 --> 03:40.154
CARL GALLAGHER: All right, we've got two coronation chicken, one

03:40.258 --> 03:42.657
crab pate, three ham and cheese, one

03:42.761 --> 03:46.686
pastrami swiss with no pickles on rye, and a tuna melt.

03:46.790 --> 03:47.936
I hope it's tuna friendly.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.153
It's dolphin friendly.

03:49.257 --> 03:50.509
It's dolphin sandwiches.

03:55.198 --> 03:58.637
[gasps] Here he is.

03:58.741 --> 03:59.924
LIAM GALLAGHER: Dad?

04:00.027 --> 04:00.688
Dad?

04:00.791 --> 04:02.668
Mommy, come.

04:02.773 --> 04:05.239
You were dreaming about her.

04:05.343 --> 04:06.212
Who?

04:06.316 --> 04:07.636
Mom.

04:07.740 --> 04:09.965
She's not coming back?

04:10.068 --> 04:11.841
Shit paper, son--

04:11.945 --> 04:12.814
yesterday's news.

04:12.917 --> 04:15.175
Come on, time to move on.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.288
Why?

04:16.392 --> 04:18.337
Why is she gone, again?

04:18.440 --> 04:20.108
You're asking me?

04:20.213 --> 04:21.463
I'm not the abandoner.

04:21.567 --> 04:23.966
I'm the abandonee.

04:24.070 --> 04:30.428
[sighs] One small left, holding the babies--

04:30.532 --> 04:32.651
plural.

04:32.755 --> 04:35.710
On me own.

04:35.813 --> 04:37.306
Everybody's on their own.

04:37.411 --> 04:40.920
The only person you can ever really rely on is yourself.

04:45.681 --> 04:46.687
You're not alone.

04:51.551 --> 04:53.670
You got family, we're together.

04:53.775 --> 04:55.547
Family is a lie.

04:55.652 --> 04:58.743
It's an excuse people like you use to keep us here.

04:58.848 --> 05:01.905
And it only works until something better comes along.

05:02.009 --> 05:06.838
Hey, hey, come here.

05:06.943 --> 05:10.173
We'll be all right, kiddo.

05:10.278 --> 05:12.502
I promise.

05:12.606 --> 05:14.621
Don't promise what you can't deliver, dad.

05:14.725 --> 05:17.157
[music playing]

05:20.006 --> 05:21.987
PADDY: I didn't take the money to the meet.

05:22.091 --> 05:23.446
Why do you think they held us captive?

05:23.550 --> 05:24.766
What?

05:24.870 --> 05:26.121
So there's a shit load of cash sitting in some motel

05:26.226 --> 05:28.310
room in Spain somewhere?

05:28.414 --> 05:30.255
Well I could hardly go back for it, could I?

05:30.359 --> 05:31.958
They was swarming the fucking place looking for me.

05:32.062 --> 05:36.197
I'm sorry, sweetheart, I have no appetite.

05:36.301 --> 05:38.281
So why did they shave your head?

05:38.385 --> 05:39.775
I didn't think to ask.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.130
So who was the contact?

05:41.234 --> 05:43.493
Jesus christ, what's with the 20 questions?

05:43.596 --> 05:45.091
I'm lucky to be here at all.

05:45.195 --> 05:47.522
William was fucking shark bait.

05:47.628 --> 05:49.294
How about a thought for his family, huh?

05:49.398 --> 05:51.171
WOMAN: Dad.

05:51.275 --> 05:52.351
What happened?

05:55.930 --> 05:57.146
Look at your hair.

05:57.250 --> 05:58.363
PADDY: Oh, I'm fine.

05:58.467 --> 06:01.942
Kitty, it's so good to see you.

06:02.046 --> 06:03.712
MICKY MAGUIRE: So what happened to [inaudible]??

06:03.817 --> 06:05.311
He drowned, you dick head.

06:05.415 --> 06:08.785
You can't swim four hours with a stab wound to your chest.

06:11.495 --> 06:13.753
Who is [inaudible]?

06:13.857 --> 06:15.491
I haven't a fucking clue, son.

06:18.166 --> 06:20.389
Called in sick so we could make a start.

06:20.494 --> 06:21.988
Oh, nice one, Max.

06:22.092 --> 06:22.960
Want to get lost?

06:23.065 --> 06:25.948
It's fine.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.207
No, no, no, no.

06:28.311 --> 06:31.646
Hey, get a room for fuck's sake.

06:31.750 --> 06:33.419
I'm trying to get a kid off to school, here.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.711
Oy, Liam, your coat.

06:35.815 --> 06:37.969
Don't lose that.

06:38.074 --> 06:40.367
Dinner money.

06:40.471 --> 06:42.730
Go off to school or something.

06:42.833 --> 06:44.884
Since when were you Liam's escort to school?

06:44.987 --> 06:45.996
Come on, out.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.489
Out.

06:47.593 --> 06:50.616
Ah, since he's supposed to be looking after Stella.

06:50.719 --> 06:52.596
Fuck's sake.

06:52.701 --> 06:56.245
Single parent-- sole responsibility.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.607
Like you all are, again.

06:58.711 --> 07:00.553
More fucking kids than Angelina Jolie.

07:00.656 --> 07:01.734
Don't swear.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.019
You absolve everything at her age.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.339
FRANK GALLAGHER: Oh really?

07:04.443 --> 07:05.972
Richard and Judy tell you that, did they?

07:06.076 --> 07:07.606
DEBBIE GALLAGHER: Yeah, well, at least he's making an effort.

07:07.710 --> 07:08.439
What have you done?

07:08.544 --> 07:10.037
After nine kids-- plenty.

07:10.141 --> 07:11.392
Plenty?

07:11.497 --> 07:12.748
FRANK GALLAGHER: Don't fucking give me that.

07:12.851 --> 07:14.346
DEBBIE GALLAGHER: You do nothing in this house.

07:14.450 --> 07:15.458
Yeah, cause you do nothing. I do everything in this house.

07:15.562 --> 07:16.777
- Oh, really? - Yes.

07:16.883 --> 07:17.751
[interposing voices] - Auntie Iris is dead.

07:17.854 --> 07:18.376
--justify myself to you.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.279
What?

07:19.383 --> 07:22.615
Auntie Iris is dead.

07:22.719 --> 07:24.803
Who's Auntie Iris?

07:24.908 --> 07:27.131
AUNTIE IRIS (ON TV): This is the last will

07:27.235 --> 07:34.948
and testament of Iris Gallagher, being of sound mind and body.

07:37.693 --> 07:42.140
Hello, Frank, it's me, Auntie Iris.

07:42.244 --> 07:45.648
Bad news-- must be dead, if you're watching this.

07:45.753 --> 07:48.151
But I've had a good innings.

07:48.255 --> 07:49.610
Auntie Iris.

07:49.714 --> 07:54.265
We're cut from the same cloth, Frank, which is why I'm leaving

07:54.369 --> 07:56.246
it all to you and the kids.

07:56.349 --> 07:59.928
[laughter]

08:00.032 --> 08:01.318
You chummy bastard.

08:01.422 --> 08:03.125
What, have I missed something, here?

08:03.230 --> 08:04.444
DEBBIE GALLAGHER: We're minted.

08:04.550 --> 08:05.939
CARL GALLAGHER: How are we minted?

08:06.043 --> 08:06.947
LIP GALLAGHER: A four bedroom house in Alderley Edge--

08:07.051 --> 08:08.371
it will be worth a fortune.

08:08.476 --> 08:09.796
Hang on.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.498
DEBBIE GALLAGHER: No, dad, you're not spoiling it.

08:11.602 --> 08:14.381
This is our chance to get out, to be something.

08:14.485 --> 08:16.224
Like, he wouldn't be here if he had the choice.

08:16.328 --> 08:18.134
Crap school is holding him back so much,

08:18.238 --> 08:20.704
he'll be written off by the time he's my age.

08:20.809 --> 08:22.929
I can-- I could do anything, you know like,

08:23.033 --> 08:26.229
be one of those posh bitches, driving around in my four

08:26.333 --> 08:27.306
by four.

08:27.410 --> 08:28.869
We're minted!

08:28.974 --> 08:29.843
Yeah!

08:29.946 --> 08:31.788
Woo!

08:31.892 --> 08:32.794
See?

08:32.900 --> 08:34.150
Till something better comes along.

08:37.763 --> 08:39.256
There is one other thing--

08:42.245 --> 08:43.879
this is Marilyn.

08:56.350 --> 08:58.470
LILLIAN TYLER: It's another consumer-focused business.

08:58.575 --> 09:00.278
We value customer feedback.

09:00.382 --> 09:02.918
Could you fill that in and pop it in me box, love?

09:03.022 --> 09:04.794
you'll be entering into a draw for a free hour

09:04.897 --> 09:06.740
with the girl of your choice.

09:06.844 --> 09:09.172
Mastering communication in business.

09:09.276 --> 09:10.804
It's no good the baby not knowing

09:10.909 --> 09:11.777
when the cock's crowing.

09:11.881 --> 09:13.583
What the fuck you on about?

09:13.688 --> 09:16.086
The boss, that's me, communicating

09:16.190 --> 09:18.170
with the worker, that's you.

09:18.275 --> 09:20.775
Maybe it's my fault that you haven't done so well, love.

09:20.880 --> 09:21.818
What the fuck's this?

09:21.922 --> 09:23.868
It's your performance review.

09:23.972 --> 09:27.793
Technical ability-- six out of 10.

09:27.897 --> 09:29.149
Teamwork-- 3?

09:29.253 --> 09:30.434
Well you are a bit of a loner.

09:30.539 --> 09:32.901
You should join in with Trixi and Stacy.

09:33.005 --> 09:36.618
Peer mentoring is an essential part of modern enterprise.

09:36.722 --> 09:38.842
I'm sure you'll up your game before your next review.

09:38.947 --> 09:40.371
Or what, I get the sack?

09:40.475 --> 09:41.587
It's a brothel.

09:41.691 --> 09:43.220
It's the oldest business in the world.

09:43.324 --> 09:44.262
It's fucking insulting.

09:46.625 --> 09:47.459
You know what?

09:47.563 --> 09:48.883
I resign.

09:48.987 --> 09:51.906
You can stick your technical ability up your ass.

09:52.010 --> 09:52.948
[music playing]

09:53.052 --> 09:53.991
TV): Yes.

09:54.095 --> 09:59.966
[inaudible] Ooh, that's nice.

10:00.070 --> 10:03.439
Very pretty, but not worth anything--

10:10.528 --> 10:11.431
MIMI MAGUIRE: You lying fuck.

10:23.244 --> 10:25.328
You going to sleep for hours?

10:25.432 --> 10:26.753
Catching up on me.

10:29.567 --> 10:32.381
I've missed you.

10:32.486 --> 10:36.619
I've missed you, too, angel.

10:36.725 --> 10:38.913
That will be the last trip for a while.

10:39.018 --> 10:42.283
Fucking better be, if you value your testicles.

10:48.050 --> 10:50.030
Need to apply for a new passport,

10:50.135 --> 10:52.532
and driving license, and all that shit?

10:56.354 --> 10:57.848
Where does it hurt?

10:57.952 --> 11:00.454
I'm fine, Mimo.

11:00.558 --> 11:04.170
Just-- please--

11:12.405 --> 11:13.865
Put the kettle on for when you're ready.

11:25.156 --> 11:27.101
Sorry about that.

11:27.205 --> 11:29.118
I need you to find somebody for me.

11:31.270 --> 11:33.147
JAMIE MAGUIRE: So what, is he going to go back out there

11:33.251 --> 11:34.537
and get these fuckers, or what?

11:34.641 --> 11:35.717
No, no.

11:35.822 --> 11:37.386
I think he's just happy to be alive, isn't he?

11:37.490 --> 11:39.019
I wonder why they just shaved his head

11:39.122 --> 11:40.026
though and not his beard.

11:46.418 --> 11:47.947
Inspection.

11:48.051 --> 11:50.345
Wedding license tomorrow-- we need to smarten the place up.

11:50.450 --> 11:51.596
Is that tomorrow?

11:51.700 --> 11:52.916
I've told you four times.

11:53.020 --> 11:56.668
Oh yeah, so you have.

11:56.772 --> 11:58.439
So why the shit-eating grin?

11:58.544 --> 12:00.698
I've been to see my parole officer.

12:00.802 --> 12:02.331
He said I've been a good boy long enough,

12:02.435 --> 12:04.485
and the council might be sympathetic to me

12:04.590 --> 12:07.160
getting my name above the door.

12:07.264 --> 12:08.584
My name is already above the door.

12:08.689 --> 12:11.468
Yeah, I know, but we can be joint licensee's--

12:11.573 --> 12:14.805
landlady, landlord.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.541
I hope you don't think I'm being presumptuous,

12:16.645 --> 12:20.918
but I popped out and got the paperwork.

12:21.023 --> 12:22.760
I'm up to me eyes right now.

12:22.864 --> 12:24.532
You could lend a hand.

12:24.636 --> 12:25.505
Well, yeah.

12:25.609 --> 12:26.443
I will.

12:32.453 --> 12:35.650
I've quit Lillian's, part in principal.

12:35.754 --> 12:39.193
I've got 46 pounds, 23 pence to my name, Kelly.

12:39.297 --> 12:40.166
How much have you got?

12:47.254 --> 12:49.234
LIAM GALLAGHER: What an amazing life.

12:49.338 --> 12:51.388
She played poker with Fidel Castro.

12:51.492 --> 12:53.334
MONICA GALLAGHER: She was a showgirl in Las Vegas.

12:53.437 --> 12:57.746
The rat pack, John Kennedy-- she were a right little goer.

12:57.850 --> 13:00.873
Yeah, and with Gallagher blood in her veins.

13:00.977 --> 13:02.853
Maybe we're not all doomed to be like dad.

13:02.958 --> 13:07.614
Yeah, cause that would be tragic, wouldn't it?

13:07.717 --> 13:10.288
Oh, no, I didn't mean it like that.

13:10.393 --> 13:12.060
Finished dividing up the spoils, have you?

13:12.164 --> 13:14.597
You got to admit, it's exciting--

13:14.701 --> 13:15.743
new life in there.

13:15.847 --> 13:18.140
Did you sneeze your brains out over winter?

13:18.245 --> 13:19.218
There is no new life.

13:19.322 --> 13:20.399
Why not?

13:20.503 --> 13:21.789
FRANK GALLAGHER: Because I'm selling.

13:21.893 --> 13:23.734
You're not going anywhere. You're staying put.

13:27.313 --> 13:29.571
Are you really that selfish?

13:29.676 --> 13:30.613
No, no, no no.

13:30.717 --> 13:33.150
I'm thinking about the family.

13:33.254 --> 13:36.554
We're the family, and we're thinking of moving.

13:42.217 --> 13:44.892
No.

13:44.997 --> 13:47.776
You're prepared to deny Stella the chance of a better life?

13:47.880 --> 13:51.008
That's a low blow, Debbie.

13:51.112 --> 13:53.301
And since when was living in a posh gaff

13:53.404 --> 13:55.802
more important than a baby being with her dad.

13:55.906 --> 13:57.087
Since you were her dad.

14:05.113 --> 14:05.947
All right.

14:06.052 --> 14:07.788
Fine.

14:07.892 --> 14:10.881
Leave the fucking nest then-- lot of ya.

14:10.985 --> 14:12.444
See how far it gets you.

15:00.181 --> 15:01.675
So what we got here, then?

15:01.779 --> 15:03.934
Oh no, we've been rumbled.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.573
Think of the scandal and the shame.

15:06.678 --> 15:07.754
Leave that alone.

15:07.859 --> 15:11.090
Get off me.

15:11.194 --> 15:13.036
But we were so good together.

15:13.140 --> 15:14.217
You won't get away with this.

15:14.321 --> 15:17.484
Oh, I think we might, Mr. Bennett.

15:17.588 --> 15:20.853
You wouldn't want the wife to know you been shagging hookers.

15:20.957 --> 15:22.103
Or the boss.

15:22.207 --> 15:24.257
I'm presuming this is a business trip.

15:24.362 --> 15:26.342
Could always call the cops--

15:26.446 --> 15:31.138
make a formal complaint. Didn't think so.

15:33.778 --> 15:36.071
The pleasure has been all ours.

15:39.476 --> 15:40.760
Candy from a baby.

15:40.865 --> 15:43.575
Mr. Mastercard meet Mr. Visa.

15:43.679 --> 15:45.034
All the children.

15:45.139 --> 15:47.639
Dad's going to shit his self when he heats about this.

15:47.744 --> 15:48.404
No.

15:48.508 --> 15:49.898
This is our thing.

15:50.002 --> 15:51.323
It's fuck all to do with the family.

15:51.427 --> 15:52.781
Eh, it all goes in the same pot.

15:52.886 --> 15:55.630
So your old man can dispense the pocket money?

15:55.735 --> 15:58.305
Haven't had much of late, have you?

15:58.410 --> 15:59.835
I'm out the door at Lilian's, and it's us

15:59.939 --> 16:01.780
pulling the grafting . Fair is fair.

16:01.884 --> 16:02.788
OK. Fine.

16:02.892 --> 16:04.038
Can you let go, please?

16:04.142 --> 16:05.601
You're twisting me nipple.

16:05.707 --> 16:08.278
[music playing]

16:22.244 --> 16:23.217
What's going on?

16:23.320 --> 16:24.224
He won't let us in.

16:24.328 --> 16:25.163
Do we have to sell?

16:29.680 --> 16:32.389
Dad?

16:32.493 --> 16:35.378
I sleep at hers for one night, and you let this happen.

16:35.481 --> 16:36.384
I didn't do owt.

16:36.488 --> 16:38.538
I knew I'd get blamed.

16:38.642 --> 16:41.110
[knocking on door]

16:43.230 --> 16:44.757
New doors are expensive, Debs.

16:44.862 --> 16:46.182
Stop pissing about.

16:46.286 --> 16:48.232
Go away.

16:48.335 --> 16:51.149
I'm freeing you from the shackles of family.

16:51.254 --> 16:52.887
I'm finished being the weight that holds you

16:52.992 --> 16:54.659
back from your wonderful life.

16:54.763 --> 16:58.204
Oh, don't be stupid.

16:58.307 --> 16:59.766
Look, you can't blackmail us.

16:59.870 --> 17:01.713
I can, and I am.

17:01.817 --> 17:04.213
Hey, go and see if the streets of Alderley Edge

17:04.318 --> 17:06.125
are indeed paved with gold.

17:06.228 --> 17:07.375
Yeah, you look after number one.

17:07.479 --> 17:09.217
And take your brother with you.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.579
He needs convincing.

17:11.684 --> 17:12.690
I'm not going.

17:12.795 --> 17:14.602
What is the point?

17:14.705 --> 17:15.574
Well, fine.

17:15.679 --> 17:16.929
We will.

17:17.032 --> 17:18.180
What, now?

17:18.284 --> 17:20.092
Well, just to see what it's like.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.094
[baby crying]

17:25.198 --> 17:26.068
Ssh.

17:26.171 --> 17:28.951
Relax, relax, relax.

17:29.054 --> 17:31.174
You're playing a dangerous game, Frank.

17:34.440 --> 17:35.760
I know what I'm doing.

17:35.865 --> 17:39.025
[music playing]

17:49.102 --> 17:51.220
You cannot beat me.

17:51.325 --> 17:52.610
I am the fucking man.

17:56.711 --> 17:58.031
I am the man.

18:00.984 --> 18:02.790
Paddy, you on the phone?

18:02.894 --> 18:10.468
PADDY MAGUIRE: No, sweet pea, just singing to myself.

18:10.572 --> 18:46.567
[humming]

18:46.671 --> 18:50.875
Mr. Wallace, [inaudible] Wallace?

18:50.980 --> 18:52.404
Oh, sorry to bother you.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.414
PADDY MAGUIRE: Wrong number?

19:01.367 --> 19:03.834
How long you been there?

19:03.938 --> 19:06.301
Long enough.

19:06.405 --> 19:09.914
Wanted to pay my respects to [inaudible] wife.

19:10.019 --> 19:12.033
That's not his real name, and even if it was,

19:12.137 --> 19:13.319
he wouldn't be in the phone book.

19:18.599 --> 19:20.998
You were never in Spain.

19:21.101 --> 19:23.533
We don't lie to each other-- golden rule.

19:35.832 --> 19:38.161
I had plenty more for a rainy day.

19:38.264 --> 19:41.356
Are you doubting my word?

19:41.461 --> 19:43.789
What am supposed to think?

19:43.893 --> 19:45.977
Something's not right, Paddy.

19:46.081 --> 19:47.853
Something's happened.

19:47.958 --> 19:50.598
Look at the state of ya.

19:50.702 --> 19:51.745
I've got a bug is all.

19:51.848 --> 19:54.247
It's hardly surprising.

19:54.351 --> 19:58.033
I know the consequences if I lie to you, for us.

19:58.138 --> 19:59.006
Why would I do that?

20:06.511 --> 20:07.449
Where you going?

20:07.552 --> 20:08.387
PADDY MAGUIRE: Work.

20:08.491 --> 20:09.394
You're not well.

20:09.498 --> 20:10.854
I'm well enough to see the business

20:10.958 --> 20:12.556
is going down the [inaudible].

20:16.760 --> 20:19.748
[music playing]

20:30.831 --> 20:32.151
How far have we walked?

20:32.256 --> 20:33.853
It's gotta have the address.

20:33.957 --> 20:34.861
I've checked 10 times.

20:34.965 --> 20:36.008
It's not there.

20:38.718 --> 20:41.148
Well it's got to be around here somewhere.

20:41.254 --> 20:43.511
She had a massive oak tree behind her on the tape.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.554
That hardly narrows it down.

20:44.658 --> 20:48.966
This is fucking tree world.

20:49.070 --> 20:50.183
Excuse me?

20:50.287 --> 20:51.781
Excuse me, we're looking for--

21:01.856 --> 21:03.384
Afternoon.

21:03.489 --> 21:05.435
Hi, yeah, we're looking for a house owned by the name of Iris

21:05.539 --> 21:07.902
Gallagher-- died recently.

21:08.006 --> 21:09.430
Sorry.

21:09.535 --> 21:11.619
Oh, she got a massive oak tree outside, like something

21:11.724 --> 21:15.024
out of English heritage.

21:15.128 --> 21:17.178
We're not going to nick anything, you know?

21:17.283 --> 21:18.984
You think just because of the way we look and talk,

21:19.089 --> 21:20.131
we're going to rob you?

21:22.528 --> 21:23.536
Oh, come on you two.

21:23.640 --> 21:24.960
I'm not wasting my money in this shithole.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.487
The nerve on her.

21:38.476 --> 21:39.413
Crisps?

21:39.518 --> 21:42.471
Coke can?

21:42.575 --> 21:45.112
[music playing]

21:55.013 --> 21:57.272
What's going on?

21:57.376 --> 21:59.217
He's adding a new cocktail.

21:59.321 --> 22:00.572
We're going to call it the nuptial.

22:00.676 --> 22:02.101
I thought we couldn't afford any new staff.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.895
Yeah, well, if I let him stare at me ass, he'll work for free.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.493
He thinks I don't notice.

22:08.597 --> 22:11.690
And we only need him for weddings.

22:11.793 --> 22:14.642
Sorry, it's husband and wife stuff--

22:14.747 --> 22:16.137
private.

22:16.241 --> 22:17.595
I'm invisible.

22:17.700 --> 22:21.904
She doesn't notice me staring at her ass either.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.545
Who in their right mind wants to get married in here, Karen?

22:24.649 --> 22:26.838
Morning pilates, breakfast opening,

22:26.942 --> 22:30.381
quiz nights, battle of the bands, theme night, strippers--

22:30.485 --> 22:31.979
everyone. My idea.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.404
I got us into the pub league, didn't I?

22:33.508 --> 22:36.323
Oh yeah, only so you can have a game yourself.

22:36.427 --> 22:38.755
A bit of support now and then won't go amiss.

22:44.835 --> 22:48.032
Got any plans for tonight?

22:48.135 --> 22:51.297
I'm a twice married, if twice deserted man, Karen, I'm not so

22:51.401 --> 22:53.903
sure your spouse would approve.

22:54.007 --> 22:54.701
In your dreams.

22:54.806 --> 22:57.134
Frequently.

22:57.238 --> 22:59.079
I mean, well you're moving, aren't you?

22:59.183 --> 23:01.442
Oh, I see bad news travels as fast as a skier

23:01.546 --> 23:02.936
down a waste pipe.

23:03.040 --> 23:03.978
You should have a party.

23:04.082 --> 23:07.140
You know, invite the regulars.

23:07.244 --> 23:08.808
I'll even throw in a couple of barrels.

23:08.911 --> 23:11.760
Karen, when have you, out of the kindness

23:11.864 --> 23:14.575
of your little stone heart, ever done anything for me?

23:14.679 --> 23:16.798
Since I needed you and the rest of yous out of here

23:16.902 --> 23:18.326
when the council come round to inspect

23:18.431 --> 23:20.515
me for a wedding license.

23:20.620 --> 23:23.191
[music playing]

23:23.295 --> 23:24.580
Deal?

23:24.684 --> 23:25.554
Deal.

23:51.298 --> 23:54.564
[laughing]

23:54.668 --> 23:57.830
PADDY MAGUIRE: Don't you walk away from me.

23:57.934 --> 23:59.290
Don't go.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.964
[music playing]

24:09.365 --> 24:10.615
I was a nurse.

24:10.719 --> 24:14.680
It's all right Patrick, I know what I'm doing.

24:14.784 --> 24:15.653
Please, stop.

24:20.690 --> 24:22.150
MIMI MAGUIRE: Don't know what to think.

24:22.255 --> 24:23.435
Something doesn't add up.

24:23.540 --> 24:26.215
KELLY BALL: It's fellas though, isn't it?

24:26.319 --> 24:27.604
Need a map to the truth sometimes.

24:27.709 --> 24:29.516
No offense. - It's all right.

24:29.620 --> 24:33.303
I don't think of myself as a fella, when I'm with you.

24:33.407 --> 24:35.630
Get me fags.

24:35.735 --> 24:38.409
Nausea, vomiting, air loss--

24:38.515 --> 24:41.259
I'd almost think that you--

24:41.363 --> 24:43.448
What were you going to say?

24:43.552 --> 24:45.151
Nothing.

24:45.254 --> 24:46.366
Oh my god.

24:46.471 --> 24:47.304
KELLY BALL: Sit down.

24:47.407 --> 24:48.381
You got any Aspirin?

24:48.486 --> 24:49.493
Bathroom cabinet.

24:57.414 --> 24:58.248
Shit.

25:07.663 --> 25:09.609
Patrick, wake up.

25:09.713 --> 25:10.582
Patrick?

25:13.812 --> 25:16.071
[screams]

25:16.175 --> 25:19.650
Big mistake letting me go.

25:19.754 --> 25:21.873
I've had this question running round and round in my head--

25:21.977 --> 25:24.306
are children nature or nurture?

25:24.410 --> 25:27.675
Do you know what DN-fucking-A my kids inherited?

25:27.780 --> 25:29.309
By rights they should be inside or dead.

25:29.413 --> 25:30.281
But they're not.

25:30.385 --> 25:31.671
And why?

25:31.775 --> 25:34.103
Because I've been there for them every step of the way.

25:34.207 --> 25:38.793
So you ask yourself, who was responsible

25:38.897 --> 25:40.079
for your little tootsie?

25:40.183 --> 25:41.052
Me?

25:41.156 --> 25:42.823
I don't think so.

25:44.665 --> 25:47.896
This addiction will not defeat me, you bitch.

You will not defeat me, you bitch.

Jesus, god.

26:15.135 --> 26:16.872
Nurture over nature and your little one

26:16.976 --> 26:19.999
will be fine and dandy.

26:20.103 --> 26:21.978
Everything else is just an excuse.

27:06.902 --> 27:08.082
Dad?

27:08.187 --> 27:09.577
I've just been to our storage facility.

27:09.681 --> 27:11.454
The cupboards bare of anything that sells at a premium.

27:11.558 --> 27:13.850
Yeah, because I shifted every last grain.

27:13.954 --> 27:15.136
You fucking idiot.

27:15.240 --> 27:16.352
Never sell all your stock.

27:16.456 --> 27:17.950
Always plan for contingencies.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.027
SHANE MAGUIRE (ON THE PHONE): Getting more in on Thursday.

27:19.132 --> 27:20.312
Don't sweat. - Wrong.

27:20.416 --> 27:21.389
You're getting more in today. - I can't.

27:21.495 --> 27:22.641
I'm busy, I'm--

27:22.745 --> 27:23.648
PADDY MAGUIRE (ON PHONE): I'm busier.

27:23.751 --> 27:24.934
That was not a request.

27:25.038 --> 27:27.434
[music playing]

27:31.257 --> 27:32.160
Oh, fuck.

27:39.352 --> 27:41.437
Well, well, well, what we got here, then?

27:41.541 --> 27:43.521
Don't you people ever knock?

27:43.625 --> 27:48.176
I would have put it outside the door.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.184
Go easy on the starch.

28:00.197 --> 28:01.900
You didn't have to shag him.

28:02.004 --> 28:03.984
Well you went AWOL.

28:04.089 --> 28:07.772
Yeah, well it was my dad's fault.

28:07.876 --> 28:10.516
They're doing me head in about getting some gear in.

28:10.621 --> 28:11.525
What's his big rush?

28:11.628 --> 28:12.705
Ah, fuck knows.

28:23.128 --> 28:24.310
LIAM GALLAGHER: Walking for hours.

28:24.414 --> 28:26.463
If we pass a bus stop, I'm going home.

28:29.485 --> 28:33.447
Excuse me, we're looking for a house.

28:33.551 --> 28:35.705
You need to be more specific than that, love.

28:35.810 --> 28:39.631
Iris Gallagher, lived alone, died recently.

28:39.735 --> 28:42.029
Landed on your feet working here, mate.

28:42.133 --> 28:43.035
You think so?

28:43.139 --> 28:44.356
12 hours a day working on me hands

28:44.460 --> 28:46.024
and knees for minimum pay.

28:46.128 --> 28:47.727
Polish kids will do it for half the price.

28:47.831 --> 28:49.325
Yeah.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.200
All me birthdays landed at once, so--

28:51.304 --> 28:52.694
CARL GALLAGHER: House like that.

28:52.799 --> 28:53.840
Must have a bit of bob.

28:53.945 --> 28:56.029
MAN: Well she's not short of a few quid--

28:56.133 --> 28:57.279
lives by herself.

28:57.385 --> 28:58.809
She rattles around the empty rooms

28:58.913 --> 29:01.311
all day, like the ghost of Christmas fucking miserable.

29:01.415 --> 29:03.985
Husband fucked off [inaudible].

29:04.090 --> 29:05.236
She got the house.

29:05.341 --> 29:08.537
The kids grow up, buggered off to South America.

29:21.044 --> 29:21.913
Mrs. McGuire?

29:24.936 --> 29:25.770
Sammy Harway?

29:25.873 --> 29:27.820
Samantha.

29:27.924 --> 29:30.460
I've not seen you since--

29:30.565 --> 29:33.239
Since you shagged Ben at my 16th.

29:33.344 --> 29:34.248
Right.

29:34.352 --> 29:35.185
Sorry about that.

29:35.289 --> 29:35.984
Don't be.

29:36.088 --> 29:37.617
You did me a favor.

29:37.721 --> 29:40.292
Can't argue-- bad breath, came before he was out of his pants.

29:40.397 --> 29:43.036
I meant you did me a favor, because it made him realize

29:43.141 --> 29:45.399
there's only one woman for him.

29:45.503 --> 29:46.789
We've been married three years, now.

29:53.947 --> 29:55.822
Council Civil Ceremony Department.

29:55.926 --> 29:57.247
You've applied for a wedding license?

30:01.138 --> 30:03.709
[music playing]

30:03.813 --> 30:06.385
[drunken singing]

30:21.498 --> 30:22.331
How was it?

30:25.563 --> 30:26.501
It was bloody awful.

30:30.740 --> 30:32.094
Screw you, Chatsworth.

30:32.199 --> 30:33.726
You tell 'em, kidda.

30:41.614 --> 30:42.621
Oh, oh, oh.

30:55.477 --> 30:57.421
You need to talk to me, Paddy.

30:57.527 --> 31:00.270
I thought I had been.

31:00.375 --> 31:01.418
I can help.

31:01.522 --> 31:04.197
We can get through this together.

31:04.302 --> 31:06.768
Get through what?

31:06.872 --> 31:07.741
I know.

31:12.987 --> 31:15.314
It's nothing to be afraid of.

31:15.419 --> 31:18.233
Stick together-- we can beat anything.

31:18.337 --> 31:21.152
It's not a death sentence these days.

31:21.256 --> 31:26.155
Plenty of cancers disappear with a bit of treatment.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.030
Cancer.

31:28.135 --> 31:29.594
Don't be afraid to say--

31:29.698 --> 31:30.741
we're strong.

31:33.833 --> 31:34.840
We are Mimi.

31:38.489 --> 31:39.356
We're strong.

31:52.385 --> 31:53.497
Excuse me, darling.

32:06.943 --> 32:09.339
Oh, sorry, love.

32:09.445 --> 32:11.598
Just trying to cripple competition?

32:20.041 --> 32:21.397
Where is it?

32:21.500 --> 32:22.890
He said, tomorrow.

32:22.994 --> 32:25.392
Come on, son, do your old man a favor, huh?

32:25.496 --> 32:28.692
What do you want him to do, magic it out of his ass?

32:39.566 --> 32:41.130
I'd've thought he'd've ripped your head off.

32:41.234 --> 32:44.083
He must be ill.

32:44.188 --> 32:45.716
I'll get you a drink.

32:53.186 --> 32:54.054
Argh!

33:00.829 --> 33:16.325
[yelling] Fuck.

33:19.382 --> 33:23.448
Oh. KID: You a copper?

33:27.303 --> 33:29.180
Does he owe you money?

33:29.284 --> 33:30.152
No.

33:34.913 --> 33:36.442
Want a score, then?

33:44.884 --> 33:46.516
How old are you?

33:46.620 --> 33:47.698
Do you want it or not?

34:09.829 --> 34:11.358
Ow, bastard.

34:11.460 --> 34:13.478
You were so confident at school.

34:13.581 --> 34:15.353
So, bring it on.

34:15.456 --> 34:16.708
I thought I'd end up marrying Ryan Giggs,

34:16.813 --> 34:18.583
or living in London, or something.

34:18.688 --> 34:20.565
Chance would be a fine thing.

34:20.668 --> 34:22.649
So how'd you end up marrying a Maguire then?

34:22.753 --> 34:27.444
I mean, it's a bit of an under-achievement, isn't it?

34:27.547 --> 34:30.188
Well you got to settle for what you can get, haven't ya?

34:37.136 --> 34:39.047
Going out, love?

34:39.152 --> 34:41.724
[music playing]

35:03.473 --> 35:05.000
Could always sell it.

35:05.105 --> 35:06.009
Buy an house round here.

35:06.113 --> 35:07.189
We'd have cash to spare.

35:07.293 --> 35:08.823
That's not point.

35:08.927 --> 35:12.401
I feel like a dick, banging on about better chances in life.

35:12.505 --> 35:14.104
Yeah, well, what's this about?

35:14.208 --> 35:15.910
Is this about Auntie Iris' house or your pride?

35:16.015 --> 35:18.308
Well, it's dad though, going on about family,

35:18.412 --> 35:21.539
and then he locks us out.

35:21.643 --> 35:24.353
I hate the thought of proving him right.

35:24.457 --> 35:26.333
Wait a minute, he locked you out?

35:26.438 --> 35:28.869
Yeah, he threw us out more like.

35:28.974 --> 35:30.434
Well that's weird.

35:30.538 --> 35:32.067
Why would dad volunteer to be on his own?

35:32.170 --> 35:33.387
Who'd look after him?

35:36.617 --> 35:39.084
She's using you, mate.

35:39.189 --> 35:43.809
You do just as much around that place as she does, if not more.

35:43.913 --> 35:45.025
What's this?

35:52.182 --> 35:53.850
Not now, sweets-- man talk.

35:57.082 --> 35:58.818
Karen is off her head if she thinks she

35:58.922 --> 36:00.416
can run that place without you.

36:00.521 --> 36:02.222
You want to draw a line in the sand, mate,

36:02.327 --> 36:04.377
and refused to be pushed around.

36:04.481 --> 36:06.184
Yeah, yeah, cheers, mate.

[music playing]

36:28.940 --> 36:31.095
[disappointed groans]

36:36.654 --> 36:41.900
I'll be supplying the flowers, be catering, cake, of course--

36:42.004 --> 36:45.130
we've also got a [inaudible] limousine service available.

36:45.235 --> 36:47.737
[crowd talking]

36:53.365 --> 36:55.727
What the fuck?

36:55.831 --> 36:57.082
It's 8:00 Frank.

36:57.186 --> 36:59.757
I'll just have a pint of lime and two Es.

36:59.863 --> 37:02.051
Was it not Chairman [inaudible] who said,

37:02.155 --> 37:05.421
the party is all-powerful.

37:05.525 --> 37:06.671
I think I'll leave you to it.

37:06.775 --> 37:08.095
No, wait.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.660
Look, you haven't even seen the center pieces on the tables.

37:09.764 --> 37:14.384
Samantha, please-- Samantha--

37:14.489 --> 37:15.739
Sorry, I tried to stop them, but you

37:15.843 --> 37:17.476
know what this lot are like.

37:17.580 --> 37:20.360
[inaudible] of the Gallaghers, apparently.

37:23.974 --> 37:25.085
Fucking bastard.

37:25.190 --> 37:27.413
I'm saving you from yourself, Karen.

37:27.517 --> 37:29.046
it's a chance worth spitting sawdust, not

37:29.151 --> 37:30.853
a Gretna Green B-and-fucking-B.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.624
Get the fuck out of my pub.

37:32.729 --> 37:34.153
Oh, you're pub?

37:34.258 --> 37:36.863
Because my name is on the door, remember?

37:36.968 --> 37:38.392
Yeah, like you'd let me fucking forget?

37:38.495 --> 37:39.712
Well, a the criminal record-- now,

37:39.816 --> 37:40.824
that's not good for business.

37:40.928 --> 37:43.603
No, it's not about my record.

37:43.707 --> 37:46.382
No, it's not.

37:46.487 --> 37:49.232
It's about all your records.

37:49.336 --> 37:50.829
Huh, Maguire?

37:50.935 --> 37:52.809
I will sell my fucking soul to the devil

37:52.914 --> 37:56.737
before I let you get your claws into the Jockey.

37:56.841 --> 38:00.662
Or maybe, that's just the same thing.

38:00.766 --> 38:04.345
Sign the application, or I walk.

38:04.449 --> 38:05.317
Never.

38:11.849 --> 38:14.385
[music playing]

38:25.851 --> 38:27.797
KELLY BALL: You may be able to fool the rest of them,

38:27.901 --> 38:30.437
but not me.

38:30.542 --> 38:31.967
What the fuck do you want?

38:32.070 --> 38:33.356
KELLY BALL: Do you know Mimi thinks you've got cancer?

38:36.552 --> 38:39.089
How does that make you feel?

38:39.192 --> 38:40.721
Mind your own business.

38:40.825 --> 38:42.354
KELLY BALL: You're a junkie, Paddy.

38:42.458 --> 38:44.960
I'm not a fucking junkie.

38:45.064 --> 38:45.967
I've been there.

38:49.233 --> 38:57.468
Big, scary, invincible Paddy McGuire, as vulnerable

38:57.572 --> 38:58.440
as the rest of us.

39:07.369 --> 39:12.268
Leave me alone, please?

39:12.372 --> 39:16.229
Jesus, you really are in deep.

39:16.332 --> 39:17.201
I'm not.

39:20.710 --> 39:22.483
First step is admitting it to yourself.

39:28.492 --> 39:33.495
Help me, please.

39:47.566 --> 39:48.401
Come here.

39:55.592 --> 39:57.503
If you knew the shit you're going

39:57.607 --> 40:03.896
to suffer trying to beat this, you'd beg me to kill you now.

40:04.001 --> 40:06.537
[music playing]

40:35.373 --> 40:37.874
Karen?

40:37.978 --> 40:39.473
Just had to see for yourself, didn't you?

40:39.577 --> 40:42.530
Just open it.

40:42.635 --> 40:43.642
You were always going to get it.

40:43.746 --> 40:46.074
We need somewhere around here.

40:46.179 --> 40:47.499
Been using the outlying area-- have

40:47.603 --> 40:49.513
to spend a fortune on security as soon as we get

40:49.618 --> 40:51.389
a booking from Chatsworth.

40:55.281 --> 40:56.219
I've got it?

40:56.323 --> 40:59.311
MAN: That's Brilliant

40:59.416 --> 41:00.249
Well done.

41:03.619 --> 41:06.190
[music playing]

41:26.375 --> 41:27.454
Mimo--

41:27.558 --> 41:30.198
Phoned round all the hospitals, just in case.

41:30.302 --> 41:33.290
Pathetic little [inaudible] does.

41:33.394 --> 41:36.834
Then got Micky to drive me around scouring the streets,

41:36.939 --> 41:40.378
in case you'd been left in an alley, been in an accident.

41:40.482 --> 41:41.385
We got back an hour ago.

41:41.489 --> 41:44.198
Where were you?

41:44.303 --> 41:45.277
Slept in the lock-up.

41:47.917 --> 41:51.286
Any particular reason?

41:51.390 --> 41:52.259
Needed some space.

41:54.865 --> 41:57.575
Our marriage is hanging by a thread, Paddy,

41:57.679 --> 41:59.069
because you're lying to me.

42:01.987 --> 42:05.879
Do you have cancer?

42:05.983 --> 42:07.373
No.

42:07.477 --> 42:08.485
No, cancer.

42:13.001 --> 42:17.934
I got myself involved in some business that I shouldn't have.

42:18.038 --> 42:20.367
I'm not telling you, because it will be nasty,

42:20.471 --> 42:22.313
and the less you know, the better.

42:22.417 --> 42:23.181
Bullshit.

42:23.286 --> 42:24.780
The less you know, the better.

42:31.762 --> 42:36.487
Somebody is going to die, Mimi, here, close by,

42:36.591 --> 42:38.990
for what was done to me.

42:39.093 --> 42:42.463
And if you don't know, they can't link you to it.

42:53.372 --> 42:54.414
Don't give up on me.

42:57.125 --> 42:58.237
I will handle it.

42:58.342 --> 43:01.328
[music playing]

43:09.146 --> 43:17.311
Oh, is this a family I see before me?

43:17.415 --> 43:18.284
You locked them out.

43:18.387 --> 43:20.229
Yes, I did--

43:20.334 --> 43:22.904
prerogative of the disenfranchised father.

43:23.008 --> 43:24.363
Bollocks.

43:24.467 --> 43:27.733
You're a lot of things, dad, but there is no way you'd volunteer

43:27.837 --> 43:28.776
to be without your family.

43:28.880 --> 43:29.818
You'd be fucked.

43:29.922 --> 43:31.242
FRANK GALLAGHER: Oh, would I?

43:31.346 --> 43:34.543
Well maybe I felt a dawning sense of liberation

43:34.648 --> 43:36.245
these past 24 hours?

43:36.350 --> 43:39.928
You had 6 Es last night, could be that?

43:40.033 --> 43:40.936
He was making a point.

43:43.576 --> 43:48.302
Why else would you lock them out?

43:48.405 --> 43:51.428
Well, I don't know, smartarse.

43:51.532 --> 43:53.443
You're the one with the answers.

43:53.547 --> 43:54.590
There is no house.

43:54.694 --> 43:55.737
What?

43:55.841 --> 43:57.474
- He made it up. - You were there.

43:57.578 --> 43:58.516
We heard the will.

43:58.620 --> 44:03.728
I did not make it up.

44:03.832 --> 44:08.139
I may have omitted a few facts.

44:08.244 --> 44:10.051
I fucking knew it.

44:10.155 --> 44:11.961
It is the same principle.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.455
Fucking greed.

44:13.560 --> 44:14.393
Greed.

44:14.498 --> 44:15.644
Greed. Greed.

44:15.749 --> 44:17.033
Me. Me.

44:17.138 --> 44:17.972
Me.

44:18.076 --> 44:20.196
Me.

44:20.300 --> 44:22.627
As soon as they thought there was something in it--

44:22.731 --> 44:23.601
We're not going.

44:23.705 --> 44:24.920
We decided that yesterday.

44:25.025 --> 44:27.178
Oh why? were the stables too small?

44:27.283 --> 44:31.243
No, because we want a family, because we want you.

44:37.602 --> 44:41.319
Thought about it, but something better came along.

44:41.424 --> 44:42.571
He means you.

44:42.674 --> 44:44.933
Yeah, I know what he means, thank you.

44:58.691 --> 45:02.026
Well, I hope you've all learned your lesson.

45:02.130 --> 45:04.979
CARL GALLAGHER: Which is?

45:05.083 --> 45:08.280
Think of your father before you think of others.

45:08.384 --> 45:10.468
You are full of shit, dad.

45:10.572 --> 45:13.109
It's my job.

45:13.214 --> 45:15.124
So what's happened with Elsa?

45:19.676 --> 45:21.413
If you'd have read the small print,

45:21.517 --> 45:23.566
you'd have realized that Auntie Iris

45:23.672 --> 45:28.709
resided temporarily in Alderley Edge, amongst other places.

45:28.814 --> 45:30.828
So you always knew that there wasn't a house?

45:30.932 --> 45:32.669
Yeah.

45:32.774 --> 45:36.770
Iris was a degenerate gambler.

45:36.873 --> 45:38.646
She lived like a gypsy her whole life.

45:38.750 --> 45:40.383
Never had tuppence in her pocket.

45:40.486 --> 45:43.058
So all that stuff about Castro and Frank Sinatra--

45:43.162 --> 45:44.552
Yeah, all true.

45:44.656 --> 45:46.914
She may have been the black sheep,

45:47.018 --> 45:50.320
but she lived a hell of a life.

45:50.424 --> 45:52.334
That's why she was my favorite auntie

45:52.439 --> 45:54.905
and I was her favorite lad.

45:57.789 --> 46:00.498
From this box to her last box.

46:00.602 --> 46:02.305
Nobody to say goodbye.

46:02.410 --> 46:08.594
Oh, I think she was trying to find her way home.

46:08.699 --> 46:12.832
Looks like the mountain came to Mohammed.

46:12.936 --> 46:14.396
I found a buyer.

46:14.500 --> 46:15.995
You sold it already.

46:16.099 --> 46:19.225
You can't look a gift horse, Debbie.

46:19.330 --> 46:21.274
40 quid?

46:21.380 --> 46:24.923
She was overdue on her ground rent a couple of years,

46:25.027 --> 46:27.320
and I've deducted my firm's expenses.

46:27.425 --> 46:29.752
[laughter]

46:42.156 --> 46:44.136
Oh no, not again.

46:44.240 --> 46:45.908
You're a prostitute.

46:46.013 --> 46:47.124
Have a look in the mirror, chum.

46:47.228 --> 46:48.896
A face like yours is enough to make

46:49.000 --> 46:51.432
a working girl go straight.

46:51.537 --> 46:52.475
Mr. Thompson?

46:52.578 --> 46:53.725
She approached me.

46:53.830 --> 46:55.254
Oh right, I'm sure your wife will understand then.

46:55.358 --> 46:56.436
You thought it was a freebie.

47:00.083 --> 47:02.619
What was that for?

47:02.723 --> 47:04.774
There's something I need to tell you, about your dad.

47:04.878 --> 47:05.955
MAN: I'm calling the police.

47:06.059 --> 47:07.031
Go ahead.

47:07.135 --> 47:10.576
Maybe they'll put us in the same cell.

47:10.680 --> 47:14.049
He's pushing you to get hold of heroin, because he's using.

47:22.284 --> 47:25.620
Come on Shaney, it were only a knock.

47:25.724 --> 47:26.593
Shane?

47:34.513 --> 47:35.521
Norma's a [inaudible].

47:35.625 --> 47:39.656
[interposing voices]

47:39.760 --> 47:40.907
MIMI MAGUIRE (VOICEOVER): Some people

47:41.011 --> 47:42.678
see coming home as a failure--

47:42.783 --> 47:43.860
Oh, very good.

47:43.963 --> 47:45.180
MIMI MAGUIRE (VOICEOVER): --like they

47:45.284 --> 47:46.986
haven't been able to do the whole wide world

47:47.090 --> 47:48.203
thing on their own.

47:48.306 --> 47:50.183
Courtesy of Auntie Iris--

47:50.287 --> 47:51.677
Gallagher through and through.

47:51.782 --> 47:53.379
Nice ones.

47:53.484 --> 47:54.838
FRANK GALLAGHER: Hey, hey, hey, well

47:54.942 --> 47:56.992
help yourselves, why don't you?

47:57.097 --> 47:59.494
CARL GALLAGHER: Did you shake it up?

47:59.598 --> 48:01.544
You shook it up, haven't ya?

48:01.648 --> 48:03.559
MIMI MAGUIRE (VOICEOVER): But sometimes coming home

48:03.663 --> 48:07.242
is the hardest thing to do.

48:07.346 --> 48:09.291
But it's not a place you can hide,

48:09.396 --> 48:11.794
not from family, at least.

48:11.897 --> 48:14.468
Home is not some last desperate refuge.

48:14.573 --> 48:18.151
Oh, Shane, wake up, please.

48:22.320 --> 48:23.432
An ambulance.

48:23.536 --> 48:24.961
I need an ambulance.

48:25.065 --> 48:26.455
MIMI MAGUIRE (VOICEOVER): It's where you can reach out

48:26.559 --> 48:29.512
for help, and find the strength to get back out there

48:29.617 --> 48:31.075
and prove the cunts wrong.

48:34.202 --> 48:37.642
My grandad's scully pigeon came home, eventually,

48:37.746 --> 48:42.540
FedExed back from France in a box, what

48:42.644 --> 48:45.633
was left of the poor thing.

48:45.737 --> 48:48.307
[music playing]

49:30.243 --> 49:31.668
MAN: So in your opinion, should we

49:31.772 --> 49:35.871
be steering our focus groups in the way of the beaver,

49:35.975 --> 49:36.671
or the cock?

49:36.775 --> 49:38.511
Like I tell my girls--

49:38.616 --> 49:41.846
think cock, act beaver.

49:41.951 --> 49:43.966
Questions?
