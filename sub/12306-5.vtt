06:08.700 --> 06:10.896
In a Halloween store
last night.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.061
I hate clowns.

06:12.070 --> 06:12.969
I hate
Halloween.

06:12.970 --> 06:14.665
Woman: I dated bobby
all semester,

06:14.670 --> 06:15.899
But it wasn't working.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.436
So I said, "I'm sorry.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.932
"I'm a sophomore,
and you're a senior,

06:19.940 --> 06:21.908
And we're not
gonna make it."

06:21.910 --> 06:24.174
Bobby is this
entitled, rich kid,

06:24.180 --> 06:26.274
Total frat boy,
big ego.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.600
Annie--
what?

06:27.620 --> 06:28.644
I speak the truth.

06:28.650 --> 06:29.970
He can't handle
being rejected.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.139
So he's being
a tool about it.

06:31.150 --> 06:33.448
I broke up with him because
he partied too much.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.120
Total lush.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.417
He's not
into his grades,

06:35.420 --> 06:37.081
And he's always
goofing around,

06:37.090 --> 06:38.455
And he's not serious.

06:38.460 --> 06:42.249
There's something
not quite right about him.

06:42.260 --> 06:43.591

disorder, mommy issues.

06:47.140 --> 06:51.065
Says last night, you claimed
he harassed you by phone,

06:51.070 --> 06:53.266
Followed you to class,
incited arguments.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.805
The dude broke
into our house.

06:54.810 --> 06:55.709
We don't know that.

06:55.710 --> 06:57.439
Yes, we do.
What happened?

06:57.450 --> 06:58.872
We just moved
into a new place,

06:58.880 --> 07:00.370
And there's
history there.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.711
It's supposed
to be haunted.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.074
People were
killed in it.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.410
That's
an urban legend.

07:04.420 --> 07:08.914
It's not haunted, but bobby
was trying to scare us.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.752
He knew
the house's history.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.353
It's Halloween.
Everyone knows.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.589
So this is
repeated behavior.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.626
Well, he's a frat boy.
He's a total brat.

07:16.630 --> 07:18.894
Part of me thinks that
he's trying to punish me,

07:18.900 --> 07:23.963
But part of me thinks he's
trying to get me back.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.329

her ex-boyfriend

07:29.340 --> 07:31.547

at alcott university,

the attacks.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.201
Rejected
ex-boyfriend?

07:34.220 --> 07:36.973
Let's see if we can find
anything to back up her claims.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.389
Also, bring him in
for questioning.

07:38.390 --> 07:41.917
I could do it.
I could do it.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.753
Why don't you
both do it?

07:46.290 --> 07:48.019
Bobby: I have an alibi
for last night.

07:48.030 --> 07:48.952
I was
in the library.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.291
Yes. You do.
It checks out.

who was it?

laurie has told you,

But I haven't done
anything wrong.

story. You keep saying that.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.702
You want to do this?

to interrupt. Sorry.

was your idea.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.100

Because he's out
of cocky arrogance, too.

a solid.

as a solid?

08:55.760 --> 08:57.455
It was a prank.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.791

and went, "boo."

harassing laurie?

with me, man.

09:04.410 --> 09:05.468
I was pissed off, man.

09:05.470 --> 09:08.531
I did what every guys
does when he gets dumped.

09:08.540 --> 09:09.678
Follow her to class,

09:09.680 --> 09:11.239
Leave 20 messages
on her phone,

09:11.250 --> 09:12.342
Break into
her house?

09:12.350 --> 09:13.442
That's what
every guy does?

09:13.450 --> 09:14.804
I never broke
into her house.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.777
I went to see her.
That's all.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.610
I left her a few
messages, man.

never hurt laurie.

And bobby will be charged
as an accomplice.

I don't want
to press charges.

was a crime.

He's a jerk, but he
shouldn't go to jail.

no time but probation,

09:46.010 --> 09:48.172
And they'll pick up
freeway trash for a year.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.547
They'll have to wear the
little, orange vests.

09:50.550 --> 09:52.587
We can instagram
the whole thing.

09:52.590 --> 09:54.240
No. Let it go.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.981
I don't want to be that girl.
Everyone'll know.

09:57.990 --> 10:00.084
The whole thing will
get a frat spin on it,

10:00.100 --> 10:01.249
And it'll all be
my fault.

10:01.260 --> 10:03.752
But it's not your fault.
What they did was wrong.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.922
Laurie, this type
of behavior escalates.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.534
You need to let them
know it's not ok.

10:09.540 --> 10:10.996
I'm a sophomore.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.570

Against bobby, it's not
about punishing him.

care of yourself.

But then I heard
somebody go

13:51.630 --> 13:53.120
Out the front door,
and that's when

13:53.130 --> 13:54.928
I saw the words
written on the wall.

13:54.930 --> 13:56.056
You didn't
see a face?

13:56.060 --> 13:58.893
It had to be bobby
or his frat brothers.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.129
They're torturing us.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.768
Bobby and his friends have
an alibi for last night.

14:02.770 --> 14:04.795
It was confirmed
by campus security.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.335
So can you think
of anyone else

14:06.340 --> 14:08.263
Who might do this?

14:08.280 --> 14:09.600
Jack: What's
the history here?

14:09.610 --> 14:12.045
This house is haunted, right?
What's the story?

14:12.050 --> 14:13.449
I don't know
if it's real or not,

14:13.450 --> 14:15.270
But I heard this man
killed his wife

14:15.280 --> 14:17.009
In this house and then
he killed himself,

14:17.020 --> 14:21.082
And now their ghosts
are haunting this place.

14:41.210 --> 14:44.430
[creak]

15:39.770 --> 15:41.898
What is it?

15:41.900 --> 15:43.061
I don't know.

15:43.070 --> 15:46.438
Some kind of bottle
with nails and powder.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.239
- Ben: It's a hoodoo
spiritual trap used in ritual.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.106
The iron in the nails
attracts evil spirits,

15:51.110 --> 15:53.579
And the moss and the leaves
grabs a hold of them.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.412
Yeah, but what about
the white powder,

15:55.420 --> 15:57.878
That's the talisman
which marks the trap,

15:57.890 --> 15:59.289
And the powder
creates a trail

15:59.290 --> 16:00.917
To lead the evil
spirits to it.

16:00.920 --> 16:01.887
How do you
know all this?

16:01.890 --> 16:03.119
My grandmother
practiced brujeria.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.656
Janice: Refers to latin
american witchcraft.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.389
Beth: It had been there
a while untouched,

16:06.390 --> 16:07.585
And the house
does have a history.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.659
So somebody could've left
it there for protection.

16:09.660 --> 16:11.697
Well, what's the
story on the house?

16:11.700 --> 16:13.168
Janice: Keeping with
the Halloween theme,

16:13.170 --> 16:16.435
I ran a search on the property
address and found this.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.135
Myspookyhouse.Com?

16:18.140 --> 16:19.460
It's a site
where people blog

16:19.470 --> 16:20.801
About haunted places
they've lived.

16:20.810 --> 16:23.575
Laurie and annie's house
actually has quite a few posts.

16:23.580 --> 16:24.536
Well, the girls
did say

16:24.550 --> 16:25.642
It was the site
of a murder.

16:25.650 --> 16:27.106
Janice: According
to spooky house, the story goes,

16:27.120 --> 16:30.112
A husband and wife,
greg and beverly miner,

16:30.120 --> 16:31.645
Bought the house in 2003.

16:31.650 --> 16:34.642
The plan was to renovate
and live happily ever after,

16:34.660 --> 16:36.116
But he had an affair
with a coed

16:36.120 --> 16:38.851
From the nearby university,
and when the wife found out,

16:38.860 --> 16:40.225
She became
consumed with grief

16:40.230 --> 16:41.823
And hung herself
in the basement.

16:41.830 --> 16:44.026
3 months later,
he killed himself, as well,

16:44.030 --> 16:46.590
And it's believed that
their spirits haunt the place.

16:46.600 --> 16:47.829
What's
the real story,

16:47.840 --> 16:49.592
Not the urban legend,
but the truth?

16:49.600 --> 16:51.261
Is there a police record
on any of this?

16:51.270 --> 16:53.534
It was 10 years ago.
The case package is archived.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.804
I requested it,
but it'll take a few days.

16:55.810 --> 16:58.302
Janice: The property reports
shows that the house

16:58.310 --> 17:00.540
Went into foreclosure
in 2003.

17:00.550 --> 17:02.348
The bank put it on the market.
It never sold.

17:02.350 --> 17:03.875
It's been a rental
property ever since.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.517
Any obituaries,
known relatives?

17:05.520 --> 17:07.339
There's nothing.
I can't find anything.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.250
Who lived in the house
before the two girls did?

17:10.260 --> 17:11.819
Utility records
show that

17:11.829 --> 17:13.423
A dr. Louis atwood,
a professor

17:13.430 --> 17:15.319
At alcott university,
was living there.

17:15.329 --> 17:18.196
Ben: Wait a second. Guess what
the professor teaches.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.020
Paranormal
and occult studies.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.165
Beth: Find atwood.
Talk to him.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.537
See what happened in that house
when he lived there.

17:23.540 --> 17:26.167
Ben, see if you can
get archives to push

17:26.170 --> 17:27.808
To get us that case
package sooner.

17:27.810 --> 17:30.131
Is there any way we
can switch that up,

17:30.150 --> 17:31.333
I can take ben
instead,

17:31.350 --> 17:34.274
Give us a chance to bond
so he can see

17:34.280 --> 17:37.318
I'm not a total jerk?

17:37.550 --> 17:40.986
Sure.
Good luck with that.

17:40.990 --> 17:43.482
It's 3 houses up.

17:43.490 --> 17:45.959
So your grandmother
was a witch?

17:45.960 --> 17:47.519
My grandmother
was a bruja, yes,

17:47.530 --> 17:49.453
More like a spiritual
healer than a witch.

17:49.460 --> 17:52.566
She practiced spells,
charms, stuff like that.

17:52.570 --> 17:54.129
Let me ask you
something.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.562
You believe in
this occult stuff?

17:55.570 --> 17:57.459
It's part of our
culture, jack.

17:57.470 --> 17:58.767
When you say
the word "occult,”

17:58.770 --> 18:00.829
Everyone automatically
thinks black magic,

18:00.840 --> 18:02.774
But it's more
of a tradition,

18:02.780 --> 18:05.545
Bonding with the universe,
positive energy.

18:05.550 --> 18:08.247
Of course.
That's the house--

18:08.250 --> 18:09.649
16644.

18:09.650 --> 18:10.776
So why did you ask beth

18:10.790 --> 18:11.871
To bring me
instead of janice?

18:11.890 --> 18:13.415
That power struggle
yesterday, ben,

18:13.420 --> 18:14.239
Wasn't my doing.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.409
I was hoping that
we could bond

18:15.420 --> 18:16.854
So you could see that
I'm not such a bad guy.

18:16.860 --> 18:18.350
And it has nothing to do
with you and janice

18:18.360 --> 18:21.728
Hooking up and making things
all awkward for you.

18:21.730 --> 18:25.792
See? We're
bonding already.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.321
Check it out.
What is it?

18:28.340 --> 18:29.637
Bones of protection.

18:29.640 --> 18:30.766
They're a charm
used to keep

18:30.770 --> 18:33.410
The evil spirits from
entering the house.

18:33.410 --> 18:36.835
More freakiness.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.513
[exhales]

18:43.820 --> 18:46.949
Let's check
around back.

19:01.070 --> 19:04.233
Looks like
nobody is home.

19:05.340 --> 19:07.308
And the door
is unlocked.

19:07.310 --> 19:09.176
We have no
probable cause.

19:09.180 --> 19:12.343
You hear that?
Hear what?

19:12.350 --> 19:14.842
Probable cause.

19:14.850 --> 19:18.548
[creak]

19:37.140 --> 19:38.494
Ben: Look at this.

19:38.510 --> 19:42.231
Why would he have files
on laurie and annie?

20:03.160 --> 20:07.461
[dripping]

20:11.310 --> 20:15.235
This guy practices
what he preaches.

20:16.740 --> 20:20.643
Animal organs.

20:23.280 --> 20:27.285
He's got plenty
of hoodoo powder--

20:27.290 --> 20:28.519
Oht

20:28.520 --> 20:30.659
Uh!

20:36.530 --> 20:37.998
You ok?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.367
Yeah.

20:45.540 --> 20:47.838
I was home all night
by myself.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.137
But no real alibi.

20:49.140 --> 20:50.574
I've done
nothing wrong.

20:50.580 --> 20:52.799
I don't recall a cop
announcing himself.

20:52.810 --> 20:54.539
I was protecting myself
from a home invasion.

20:54.550 --> 20:57.611
Ben: Why did you have files on
laurie stokes and annie garner?

20:57.620 --> 21:00.385
Because they're the new
tenants of the house.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.358
What are you
doing with them?

21:02.360 --> 21:05.216
You stabbed a female student
with a tribal knife

21:05.230 --> 21:08.951
Says the case was dropped
when she refused to testify.

21:08.960 --> 21:09.927
Did you
pay her off?

21:09.930 --> 21:11.898
She asked me to.
I was helping her.

21:11.900 --> 21:12.970
By draining
her blood?

21:12.970 --> 21:15.735
Some blood.
It was a cleansing.

21:15.740 --> 21:18.129
I was removing evil
energy from her body.

21:18.140 --> 21:20.006
Jack: Some kind of exorcism
through bloodletting?

21:20.010 --> 21:22.672
You have such contempt
for what you don't know.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.103
Is that what you plan
to do to laurie and annie?

21:25.110 --> 21:27.249
Why did you have
the pictures in your house?

21:27.250 --> 21:28.274
I want to help them.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.113
Those girls are in danger.
I've lived in that house.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.543
I know.
Jack: Know what?

21:33.550 --> 21:37.384
You don't believe in
the spirit world, but it's real.

21:37.390 --> 21:39.324
I've experienced it
in that house.

21:39.330 --> 21:41.822
What did you
experience?

21:41.830 --> 21:43.559
It's true.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.665
What the legend says
is true.

21:45.670 --> 21:46.796
It's haunted
by the dead,

21:46.800 --> 21:49.132
And anyone who's lived there
has experienced it.

21:49.140 --> 21:50.437
I stayed
longer than most.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.829
Why did you
move out, louts?

21:52.840 --> 21:56.333
One night, I was
getting ready for bed.

21:56.340 --> 22:00.072
I heard a noise,
so I went out onto the landing,

22:00.080 --> 22:03.209
And there it was.

22:03.220 --> 22:05.439
Ben:
There what was?

22:05.450 --> 22:07.418
A specter.

22:07.420 --> 22:10.583
A ghost, a phantom,
whatever you want to call it.

22:10.590 --> 22:11.853
The thing reached out
for me,

22:11.860 --> 22:13.885
And all reason and logic
went out the window.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.994
I knew, whatever it was,
it was evil.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.196
And that's when you decided
it had to be stopped.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.725
Someone needs
to help these girls.

22:19.730 --> 22:21.664
They need
to be protected.

22:21.670 --> 22:23.638
I can perform
a cleansing.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.130
I can help them.

22:25.140 --> 22:27.029
Janice: Wait. So louts
isn't stalking the girls.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.838
He's obsessed
with the house?

22:28.840 --> 22:30.330
That's a first
for me.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.340
I filed the charges.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.205
He'll be placed in
county for the moment.

22:33.210 --> 22:34.177
How long
can we hold him?

22:34.180 --> 22:35.602
Well, assaulting
an officer in this case

22:35.620 --> 22:36.746
Isn't really
gonna stick,

22:36.750 --> 22:37.740
Not once he
lawyers up.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.218
You're gonna need to
find something fast.

22:39.220 --> 22:40.710
I got to run.
It's Halloween.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.382
I got a kid.
I'll be on cell.

22:43.390 --> 22:45.154
Thanks.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.527
Happy Halloween.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.319
Louis atwood says
that you

22:50.330 --> 22:52.219
Entered his house
without a warrant.

22:52.230 --> 22:53.595
I had
probable cause.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.261
Of course you did.

22:55.270 --> 22:57.591
You also confiscated
materials.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.102
You're up to your
old tricks, jack.

23:00.110 --> 23:02.169
Remember
what I told you?

23:02.180 --> 23:04.330
Something about two
weeks, get out of town.

23:04.350 --> 23:05.909
When are you
leaving, jack?

23:05.910 --> 23:07.207
I'm gonna tell beth
and everybody else

23:07.220 --> 23:08.608
Who will listen what
you did in new york,

23:08.620 --> 23:11.339
And you're gonna
lose your badge.

23:11.350 --> 23:12.272
And ethan?

23:12.290 --> 23:14.645
Don't you dare
utter his name.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.981
My son doesn't
even know you.

23:16.990 --> 23:18.719
But he will one day,

23:18.730 --> 23:21.256
And he'll know you
kept him from me.

23:21.260 --> 23:22.284
He'll know.

23:22.300 --> 23:25.793
Give your notice, jack.
Leave |.A.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.770
My threat is real.

23:41.180 --> 23:43.911
[music playing]

23:45.390 --> 23:47.313
Whoo!

23:47.320 --> 23:50.654
Whoo hoo!

24:08.640 --> 24:10.506
Children:
Trick or treat!

24:10.510 --> 24:12.877
Man: Come on, guys.
Let's go.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.943
Boo!
Aah!

24:18.950 --> 24:21.510
Ha ha ha!

24:24.090 --> 24:25.888
Children:
Trick or treat!

24:25.890 --> 24:28.222
What are we having
for dinner?

24:28.230 --> 24:30.153
Uh...Candy.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.321
[cell phone rings]

24:31.330 --> 24:33.469
Hold on.
Hold on, honey.

24:33.470 --> 24:34.790
Hello?

24:34.800 --> 24:36.438
Oh, mom, we're gonna
miss all the good candy.

24:36.440 --> 24:39.034
What?
I can't hear you.

24:39.610 --> 24:40.930
Ok. I can
hear you now.

24:40.940 --> 24:44.035
What do you mean,
released?

24:44.380 --> 24:46.599
Boo, kid. What you
got in the bag?

24:46.610 --> 24:50.376
More candy than
he'll ever need.

24:50.380 --> 24:51.745
Give it back.

24:51.750 --> 24:52.888
Huh.

24:52.890 --> 24:56.258
Jack: Is there
a problem?

24:56.260 --> 24:57.113
No, sir.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.225
Give him back
the bag.

24:59.230 --> 25:02.928
Now get out of here
before I call the cops.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.166
You ok?

25:08.170 --> 25:11.492
Yeah. Thanks.

25:13.410 --> 25:15.139
Here.

25:15.140 --> 25:19.202
You can have this.
I got two.

25:20.480 --> 25:24.018
Thanks.

25:24.950 --> 25:29.387
Amanda: Ethan?
Ethan, where are you?

25:29.390 --> 25:33.054
Over here.

25:33.060 --> 25:35.188
What are you doing

25:35.200 --> 25:36.429
Trick-or-treating.
Ok.

25:36.430 --> 25:37.795
Well, I think you got
enough candy

25:37.800 --> 25:39.290
To last for
a lifetime.

25:39.300 --> 25:42.861
Come on.
Yeah. Ok. Ready?

25:56.750 --> 25:57.820
Beth: Louis atwood
made bail.

25:57.820 --> 25:59.174
I sent a unit to his
house. He's not there.

25:59.190 --> 26:01.511
I'm headed to
laurie's house now.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.557
I'll be there.

yourself from this house.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.431
I feel underdressed.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.569
If atwood is here,
he'll be in costume.

27:33.580 --> 27:35.139
We'll do a sweep.

27:35.150 --> 27:37.118
You guys take the front

I'm gonna look around.

Whoo! Ha ha!

27:58.810 --> 27:59.868
Hey, what's
going on?

27:59.870 --> 28:02.669
We're just here to
make sure everything is ok.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.829
Where's laurie?

28:03.840 --> 28:06.707
Here somewhere.
She's a french maid.

28:06.710 --> 28:08.644
Can you help me
find her?

28:08.650 --> 28:11.847
Yeah. Sure.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.912
Hey, come take
a look at this.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.981
It's everything confiscated
from louts atwood's home.

28:17.990 --> 28:20.322
It's atwood's notes,
theories,

28:20.330 --> 28:21.388
History on the house.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.425
He was completely
consumed by this house.

28:23.430 --> 28:26.320
He keeps making reference
to a shadow figure

28:26.330 --> 28:27.297
He saw lurking there.

28:27.300 --> 28:28.597
He really believes
he was being haunted

28:28.600 --> 28:31.399
By the ghost of the house's
former owner greg miner.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.333
With every sighting,
he followed the figure,

28:33.340 --> 28:35.934
_But he wrote that it
disappeared into thin air.

28:35.940 --> 28:37.203
He thought he was
seeing a ghost--

28:37.210 --> 28:38.974
He was afraid--
or it could've been

28:38.980 --> 28:41.142
One big, hallucinatory
delusion,

28:41.150 --> 28:44.370
Or maybe atwood might
actually have been

28:44.390 --> 28:45.846
Seeing something else.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.284
We don't
have the facts.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.042
Did you get the case
package from archives?

28:49.060 --> 28:50.915
I called.
They're backed up.

What are you doing here?

29:35.200 --> 29:36.736
Who invited you?

29:36.740 --> 29:39.368
I have a class
with annie.

29:39.370 --> 29:42.499
You are--
are you working?

29:42.510 --> 29:44.979
Why would you
ask me that?

29:44.980 --> 29:47.074
I don't see
a costume.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.741
You need to leave.
No.

29:48.750 --> 29:51.447
I'm here with friends.
I was invited.

29:51.450 --> 29:54.147
Are you ok? You seem
a little anxious.

What did you
just call me?

30:03.460 --> 30:06.521
I said, "nice to
see you, as well."

30:06.530 --> 30:09.761
What did you
think I said?

30:12.640 --> 30:14.335
I'm a cop.

30:14.340 --> 30:17.207
For you, it will never
be nice to see me.

Do you understand?

30:19.350 --> 30:21.045
All right. I'm sorry.

30:21.050 --> 30:24.441
I didn't mean to
upset you, lieutenant.

Aargh!

31:05.960 --> 31:07.189
Ha ha! Sorry.

31:07.190 --> 31:10.922
I thought I'd apologize for
scaring you the other day.

31:10.930 --> 31:12.625
By giving me
a heart attack?

31:12.630 --> 31:14.394
Ok. It's a little
liquor logic,

31:14.400 --> 31:16.437
But you got to
lighten up, girl.

at the costume store,

nothing to say.

alive, then where is he?

was released

disappeared.

I heard something
behind me,

And I turned,
and he hit me.

Did you see the face of
the person who hit you?

34:14.280 --> 34:17.011
Yeah. I got
a look at him.

Is that him?

No.

give your statement

right here.

door-to-doors,

34:34.840 --> 34:35.523
No progress.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.235
Where would he go?
Exactly.

34:37.239 --> 34:38.730
Where would he go?

34:38.739 --> 34:42.335
Greg miner could suffer
from fixation regression.

34:42.340 --> 34:44.069
After his wife
committed suicide,

34:44.080 --> 34:45.434
He became obsessed
with the house because

34:45.449 --> 34:48.043
He couldn't accept
the traumatic loss.

34:48.050 --> 34:49.472
So in haunting
his house,

34:49.480 --> 34:51.346
He stays connected
to his wife,

34:51.350 --> 34:52.579
At least in spirit.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.639
The house exercises a
gravitational pull on him.

34:55.659 --> 34:57.219
He can't escape
its orbit,

34:57.220 --> 34:58.779
And anyone who
enters the house

34:58.790 --> 35:01.953
He perceives as a threat
to his wife.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.598
Why take laurie?

35:03.600 --> 35:04.829
He's escalating.

35:04.830 --> 35:06.229
I mean, the guy
asked them politely,

35:06.230 --> 35:08.267
He haunted them, scared them,
told them to get out.

35:08.270 --> 35:12.298
They didn't.
They threw a party instead.

35:18.850 --> 35:23.674

40:49.910 --> 40:51.799
I don't think this
is a good idea, janice.

40:51.810 --> 40:54.745
Calm down. This
isn't a booty call.

40:54.750 --> 40:57.310
It's not?
No. It's not.

40:57.320 --> 40:59.015
The sex was great
and all,

40:59.020 --> 41:01.318
But I get this feeling,
this sense

41:01.320 --> 41:04.187
That what you need
more than sex

41:04.190 --> 41:07.285
Is a friend.

41:11.100 --> 41:13.819
[music playing]

42:02.250 --> 42:04.048
[telephone rings]

42:04.050 --> 42:06.610
Woman: Seattle
psychiatric hospital.

42:06.620 --> 42:08.213
This is michelle webber.

42:08.220 --> 42:11.155
I'm calling to confirm
whether patient 5679

42:11.160 --> 42:13.481
Is still
in custody there.

42:13.490 --> 42:15.527
What did you say
your name is?

42:15.530 --> 42:17.589
Michelle webber.

42:17.600 --> 42:20.729
I'm on the
notification list.

42:20.730 --> 42:22.698
Yes. I see
your name here.

42:22.700 --> 42:26.238
Patient 5679 is
still in custody.

42:26.240 --> 42:30.780
Has he had
any visitors?

42:31.640 --> 42:33.608
No.
