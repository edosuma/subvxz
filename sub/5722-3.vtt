He's attacking us.

Laura: <i> I got an e-mail today</i>

00:19.180 --> 00:20.779
It turned out to be
a top secret document.

00:20.781 --> 00:23.949
- Who was the source of the leak?
- I have no idea.

00:23.951 --> 00:27.085
And I will respect their trust
whatever happens to me.

00:27.087 --> 00:29.021
She's asking for the rest of it.

00:29.023 --> 00:30.589
Korzenik:
<i>You send that,</i>

00:30.591 --> 00:32.591

00:32.593 --> 00:34.760
I had a meeting
with the BND top brass.

00:34.762 --> 00:36.929
Giving you 24 hours
to leave the country.

00:36.931 --> 00:38.630
But the Germans want
a head on a spike.

00:38.632 --> 00:40.432
So give them Saul's.

00:40.434 --> 00:42.935
Welcome to Beirut.

00:42.937 --> 00:44.503
It's good.

00:44.505 --> 00:45.838
Shame I can't tempt you.

01:03.791 --> 01:05.157
Look.

01:05.159 --> 01:07.025
It was the CIA woman.

01:07.027 --> 01:08.327
She was the target.

01:08.329 --> 01:09.795
Six hours
he was questioned.

01:09.797 --> 01:13.065
Whoever paid him, he was more
afraid of them than dying.

01:13.067 --> 01:14.666
Someone wants you dead.

01:14.668 --> 01:16.335
Saul: <i> I want to be</i>

I'll be able to think more

03:47.921 --> 03:51.756

in Lebanon was lying?

hardly saying a word.

04:29.463 --> 04:32.230
You need to talk to me.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.041
He was tortured, okay?

04:43.043 --> 04:45.377
He finally admitted
I was the target,

04:45.379 --> 04:48.580
but he was too scared
to say who hired him.

04:48.582 --> 04:50.081
I don't understand.

04:50.083 --> 04:53.151
How does... how does
that make him reliable?

04:54.988 --> 04:57.522
He had two secrets--
one he could tell,

04:57.524 --> 04:59.824
one he was willing to die for.

04:59.826 --> 05:01.259
And did he?

05:01.261 --> 05:02.060
Die?

05:02.062 --> 05:03.361
Yeah, he was executed.

05:03.363 --> 05:04.429
He was shot in the face
point-blank.

05:04.431 --> 05:06.831

Intelligence Agency.

06:17.271 --> 06:19.271
It's not every day
a leading German industrialist

06:19.273 --> 06:21.273
is the target
of an assassination attempt.

06:21.275 --> 06:22.607
Mmm.

06:22.609 --> 06:23.942
I run a foundation,

06:23.944 --> 06:25.443
consider myself
a philanthropist.

06:25.445 --> 06:26.945
Have a seat.

06:26.947 --> 06:29.481
And yet your company is
thriving by all accounts.

06:29.483 --> 06:31.483
(Chuckles)
That's true.

06:31.485 --> 06:32.817
The steel business
is experiencing

06:32.819 --> 06:34.352
an unexpected upturn.

06:45.065 --> 06:48.266
Any idea why someone would want
to kill you in Lebanon?

06:50.537 --> 06:52.337
None.

06:52.339 --> 06:54.339
Might it be related to
your Chief of Security

06:54.341 --> 06:56.541
meeting with a representative
of Hezbollah

06:56.543 --> 06:58.543
the day you arrived there?

06:58.545 --> 07:00.212
You'd have
to ask her.

07:00.214 --> 07:02.514
I don't know where she is,
that's why I'm asking you.

07:02.516 --> 07:04.216
I told you.

07:04.218 --> 07:05.584
I don't know.

07:05.586 --> 07:08.153
Wouldn't be the first time
your family has collaborated

07:08.155 --> 07:10.488
with those on the wrong side
of history.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.157
(Sighs)

07:12.159 --> 07:14.659
Mr. Berenson,
it's hardly a secret

07:14.661 --> 07:17.495
my grandfather was
a big-time Nazi.

07:17.497 --> 07:21.499
I've devoted my whole life
to atoning for that fact.

07:21.501 --> 07:25.003
Your foundation has donated
tens of millions of dollars

07:25.005 --> 07:27.105
to Muslim charities
all over Europe.

07:28.342 --> 07:30.175
Also not a secret.

07:30.177 --> 07:33.011
I don't have to tell you--
there are many points

07:33.013 --> 07:36.615
at which social and terrorist
causes cannot help meeting.

07:36.617 --> 07:37.949
Not in our case.

07:37.951 --> 07:39.951
We account for every cent.

07:39.953 --> 07:41.786
I take personal
responsibility for that.

07:41.788 --> 07:43.054
Maybe you don't
consider Hezbollah

07:43.056 --> 07:44.256
a terrorist organization.

07:44.258 --> 07:47.025
Is that a question?

07:47.027 --> 07:49.160
Yeah, it is--
do you or don't you?

07:50.631 --> 07:55.200
I deplore violence of any kind,
but one must always distinguish

07:55.202 --> 07:58.370
between legitimate revolt
against occupation

07:58.372 --> 08:00.038
and outright terrorism.

08:00.040 --> 08:04.776
Is firing rockets against
civilian targets legitimate,

08:04.778 --> 08:06.444
in your opinion?

08:06.446 --> 08:08.980
I won't be put on the defensive
just because you have managed

08:08.982 --> 08:10.882
to turn the conversation
towards Israel.

08:10.884 --> 08:12.584
Actually, I was curious
what you think.

08:12.586 --> 08:14.719
What I think is--

08:14.721 --> 08:17.922
nothing has made the world more
dangerous in the last 15 years

08:17.924 --> 08:19.557
than the foreign policy
of the United States.

08:19.559 --> 08:23.261
I'm not a statesman,
Herr DÃ¼ring.

08:23.263 --> 08:25.297
I'm a spy.

08:25.299 --> 08:29.301
Well, you are all
great humanitarians,

anyone on trial.

I came here to find out
where Carrie Mathison is.

08:39.513 --> 08:41.078
I can't help you with that.

08:41.081 --> 08:42.914
You can't or you won't?

08:42.916 --> 08:45.116
I don't track her movements.

08:45.118 --> 08:47.652
As far as I know,
she's taking some time off

08:47.654 --> 08:49.187
after what happened.

08:50.357 --> 08:53.091
It's imperative
I speak with her.

08:55.362 --> 08:57.562
She doesn't work for you
anymore.

08:59.633 --> 09:02.500
I know how frustrating
that must be.

09:04.938 --> 09:07.505

What did he want?

11:20.407 --> 11:21.573

11:21.575 --> 11:23.741
And to put the fear

It wasn't that hard.

11:30.350 --> 11:33.351
I didn't like him much.

11:33.353 --> 11:35.854

11:35.856 --> 11:37.755
Yeah.

Well, he is now.

moving out of the house.

13:06.846 --> 13:08.613

13:24.030 --> 13:25.029
Well, you're not helping.

13:25.031 --> 13:26.197
You are not letting me.

13:26.199 --> 13:27.799
- Is that right?
- That is right.

13:27.801 --> 13:29.934
Because you don't know the first
thing about it, about any of it.

13:29.936 --> 13:31.202
And whose fault is that?

13:31.204 --> 13:32.870

not knowing what's going on.

13:41.715 --> 13:43.047
(Chuckles)

13:43.049 --> 13:45.783

13:47.821 --> 13:49.821
That, too.

13:54.461 --> 13:57.795
Look, I know I haven't
been myself the last few days.

13:57.797 --> 14:01.566
You were in hiding, you just
put your daughter on a plane.

14:01.568 --> 14:03.134

14:08.174 --> 14:11.476

14:13.013 --> 14:14.512

14:21.655 --> 14:23.921
Maybe there is a way
that you can help.

14:23.923 --> 14:27.859
That I can see
this better. I...

14:30.096 --> 14:32.430
It would be asking a lot of you.

14:32.432 --> 14:34.699
Tell me.

14:36.269 --> 14:37.669
Listen, I'm starving.

14:37.671 --> 14:40.171
Can we find a place to eat
and talk about it there?

14:42.809 --> 14:44.842
(Birds chirping, ducks quacking)

14:46.846 --> 14:48.946

14:48.948 --> 14:50.815
(Exhales)
So...

14:50.817 --> 14:53.351
Um...

14:54.721 --> 14:56.320
You know I'm bipolar.

14:56.322 --> 14:58.523
(Sighs)
Yeah.

14:59.359 --> 15:01.959
And that I take lithium.

15:01.961 --> 15:03.294
Which is good for me.

15:03.296 --> 15:06.197

safe and sane.

15:07.801 --> 15:11.035

15:11.037 --> 15:13.471

off of the medication.

15:17.844 --> 15:19.977
No.

15:19.979 --> 15:22.013
Well...

15:22.015 --> 15:25.149
It can be scary as hell.

15:25.151 --> 15:28.019
But also exhilarating.

15:28.021 --> 15:30.688

I mean, you feel...

15:30.690 --> 15:32.657
You feel elated.

15:32.659 --> 15:33.658
You feel like

15:33.660 --> 15:35.827
you're flying
down a ski slope

15:35.829 --> 15:37.228
with no chance
of falling.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.163
Ah, anybody
would miss that.

15:39.165 --> 15:40.732
Until you don't.

15:40.734 --> 15:42.734
Until... you do fall.

15:42.736 --> 15:45.336
Because you can't
avoid falling;

15:45.338 --> 15:46.904

15:49.509 --> 15:51.542

to hear about this?

15:51.544 --> 15:54.245
You sure you'll still
like me in the morning?

15:59.352 --> 16:01.586

16:04.023 --> 16:06.190

16:14.200 --> 16:15.666

16:20.974 --> 16:23.975
The point is that
the meds have saved my life.

16:23.977 --> 16:25.243
Literally.

16:25.245 --> 16:28.279
But something is lost, too.

16:28.281 --> 16:29.947
The elation.

16:31.584 --> 16:33.084
It's more than that.

16:33.086 --> 16:35.753
There's this... this window,

16:35.755 --> 16:37.955
when you've got
all that crazy energy

16:37.957 --> 16:39.290
but you're still lucid,

16:39.292 --> 16:40.825
you're still
making sense.

16:40.827 --> 16:43.895
- And that's always when I did my best work.
- Mm-hmm.

16:44.097 --> 16:47.765
I took down a major
insurgent network in Iraq.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.967
I stopped an attack on
the State Department in DC.

16:49.969 --> 16:51.702
You want to go
off your meds now?

16:51.704 --> 16:52.937
Is that what you're saying?

16:52.939 --> 16:54.772
To figure
this out?

16:56.142 --> 16:57.341
No.

16:57.343 --> 16:59.477
No?

16:59.479 --> 17:02.480
I've already gone off them.

17:02.482 --> 17:04.781
Three days ago.

17:08.221 --> 17:10.287
What have you got?

17:10.289 --> 17:12.656
Tell me Carrie showed up
for work this morning.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.025
No such luck.

17:14.027 --> 17:15.859
She hasn't been near
the place for five days.

17:15.862 --> 17:17.361
Not since she got
back from Beirut.

17:17.363 --> 17:19.896
Can we jack into the cameras
inside the building?

17:19.898 --> 17:22.199
- Hi-tech firewall.
- Thanks to her, no doubt.

17:22.201 --> 17:24.969
Um, Laura Sutton

17:24.971 --> 17:26.936
is on her e-mail.

17:30.499 --> 17:35.053
_

17:37.517 --> 17:40.151
- What did DÃ¼ring say?
- That he doesn't know where she is, either.

17:40.153 --> 17:41.652
He's got seven residences
in Germany alone.

17:41.654 --> 17:43.521
No sign of Carrie
at any of them.

17:43.523 --> 17:45.222
We need to talk.

17:51.831 --> 17:53.898
I've known Dar Adal
for 30 years.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.433
You don't think
he's gonna pick up the phone,

17:55.435 --> 17:56.734
tell me that
my Berlin Station Chief

17:56.736 --> 17:58.402
is looking to put
a knife in my back?

17:58.404 --> 18:00.604
- Saul, listen to me...
- Don't say a fucking word.

18:00.606 --> 18:02.239
I was desperate
to save my job...

18:02.241 --> 18:03.841
Oh, bullshit!

18:03.843 --> 18:06.777
You were cold
and calculating.

18:06.779 --> 18:08.579
You bet on his ego
and our rivalry,

18:08.581 --> 18:10.014
hoping that'd be enough
to take me down.

18:10.016 --> 18:11.582
You couldn't be more wrong.

18:11.584 --> 18:13.284
Stop it.

18:16.522 --> 18:18.389
Know what the worst part is?

18:18.391 --> 18:20.524
You came up short, Allison.

18:20.526 --> 18:23.294
If you aim to kill, don't miss.

18:23.296 --> 18:25.563
Have I taught
you nothing?

18:25.565 --> 18:28.132
You taught me everything.

18:30.236 --> 18:33.971
I treated you like
an elite intelligence officer.

18:33.973 --> 18:37.608
So start fucking
behaving like one.

18:39.378 --> 18:40.778
Okay.

18:42.782 --> 18:45.316
So when do you want me gone?

18:47.620 --> 18:50.554
You're not going anywhere.

18:50.556 --> 18:52.923
- What?
- You heard me.

18:52.925 --> 18:55.893
Can't afford
a shake-up right now.

18:55.895 --> 18:57.795

18:57.797 --> 18:59.830

in the pipeline.

18:59.832 --> 19:01.065

19:01.067 --> 19:02.900
So-so who's going under the bus

19:02.902 --> 19:04.802
to make it nice
with the Germans?

19:04.804 --> 19:07.304

19:10.076 --> 19:11.275
Thank you.

19:11.277 --> 19:13.310

But now that you're
willing to help,

a little bit.

19:30.997 --> 19:32.963

- Okay.

sounds sketchy,

but together, we can do
this without a doubt.

That's when you
give me the pills.

it's time, believe me.

20:09.902 --> 20:12.436

before you went off the drugs.

28:40.645 --> 28:43.480
Well, Numan,

28:43.482 --> 28:47.217
I'm a fan of yours, too.

28:52.524 --> 28:55.392
I have the rest
of the documents.

28:55.394 --> 28:57.394
I'll vet them, get them out.

28:57.396 --> 28:59.396
Just like last time.

28:59.398 --> 29:01.498
Don't you get scared?

29:01.500 --> 29:05.235
Yeah, I guess,
but what can I do?

29:05.237 --> 29:08.805
Go home to America.

29:08.807 --> 29:11.975
I have two warrants
out for my arrest there.

29:13.845 --> 29:16.646
I can't go back home, either.

29:16.648 --> 29:18.648
To Turkey?

29:18.650 --> 29:20.884
I'm guessing.

29:20.886 --> 29:22.886
Yeah.

29:33.999 --> 29:35.865
Thank you.

29:35.867 --> 29:37.600
You're doing
the right thing.

29:37.602 --> 29:40.437
I hope so.

29:40.439 --> 29:42.272
I'd better go.

29:42.274 --> 29:44.707
How can I reach you?

29:44.709 --> 29:46.910
You can't.

29:52.413 --> 29:54.694
_

30:18.310 --> 30:20.743
Is that really necessary?

30:20.745 --> 30:24.080
Hey, I'm not the one
who crashed last night.

30:24.082 --> 30:26.449
But I made some good progress
after you went to bed.

30:26.451 --> 30:28.218
We can move on
to Baghdad today.

30:28.220 --> 30:30.386
I meant does it have
to go up your nose?

30:30.388 --> 30:32.222
I mean,
caffeine is caffeine.

30:32.224 --> 30:34.390
I could make you
a really strong cup of coffee.

30:34.392 --> 30:37.794
This gets me there faster.

31:05.624 --> 31:07.490
(Numbers dialing)

31:07.492 --> 31:11.261
(Line ringing)

31:11.263 --> 31:12.762
Jonas, it's me again.

31:12.764 --> 31:14.819
I've got something urgent.
Where are you?

31:38.390 --> 31:41.624
(High-pitched laughing)

31:41.626 --> 31:45.128
You little fucker.

31:50.869 --> 31:52.535
Dude, where have you been?

31:52.537 --> 31:54.404
Meeting someone.

31:54.406 --> 31:55.805
You got a girlfriend?

31:55.807 --> 31:58.808
About fucking time.

31:58.810 --> 32:00.843
It was Laura Sutton.

32:00.845 --> 32:03.913
I gave her the documents.

32:04.883 --> 32:07.817
- What?
- You heard me.

32:07.819 --> 32:09.219
So I don't want any more crap
about selling them

32:09.221 --> 32:10.653
to the highest bidder
or whatever.

32:10.655 --> 32:11.854
It's done.

32:11.856 --> 32:14.090
You just decided for
the both of us, huh?

32:14.092 --> 32:16.326
Yeah, I did.

32:16.328 --> 32:18.027
What an asshole.

32:18.029 --> 32:20.096
Korzenik, it was
the right thing to do.

32:20.098 --> 32:21.731
Was it?

32:21.733 --> 32:23.800
You're a fool, Numan.

32:25.036 --> 32:27.904
You don't even know
what a fool you are.

32:34.179 --> 32:36.679
Ibrahim Hasan--
bomb maker for Abu Nazir.

32:36.681 --> 32:38.181
What about him?

32:38.183 --> 32:39.849
I said I'd help his
family in exchange

32:39.851 --> 32:41.117
for some sensitive
information.

32:41.119 --> 32:42.385
And I couldn't
make it happen.

32:42.387 --> 32:45.355
So it might be payback
for a broken promise?

32:45.357 --> 32:48.558
No, he's dead, but
he had a son, Bassam.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.360
Be 18 now.

32:50.362 --> 32:53.730
Okay, checking.

32:53.732 --> 32:55.765
Wait a minute,
I know this story.

32:55.767 --> 32:57.233
This is where you got
kicked out of Iraq

32:57.235 --> 32:59.068
for bribing a guard
at Khadimayah Prison.

32:59.070 --> 33:01.404
How did you know about that?

33:01.406 --> 33:03.773
Who do you think
background-checked you for Otto?

33:03.775 --> 33:06.209
(Chuckles)

33:06.211 --> 33:07.744
Really?

33:07.746 --> 33:09.379
I know all kinds
of things about you,

33:09.381 --> 33:10.713
- Carrie Mathison.
- Oh.

33:10.715 --> 33:11.981
Well, I got hired,
didn't I?

33:11.983 --> 33:13.483
(Clicks tongue)
Barely.

33:18.556 --> 33:20.223
Nothing on the son.

33:20.225 --> 33:22.592
But the wife Sanaa
blew herself up

33:22.594 --> 33:24.794
at a checkpoint
in Mualameen,

33:24.796 --> 33:26.496
killing three
American soldiers,

33:26.498 --> 33:29.499
wounding seven others.

33:29.501 --> 33:31.501
Keep Bassam on the list.

33:31.503 --> 33:34.137
- Mm-hmm.
- Next.

33:34.139 --> 33:37.073
Man:
Bad business down in Lebanon.

33:37.075 --> 33:40.243
It's only gonna get worse.

33:40.245 --> 33:45.415
Well, maybe you can explain
exactly how it fits together.

33:45.417 --> 33:47.684
How what fits together?

33:47.686 --> 33:50.753
Carrie Mathison was the one
handling security, right?

33:50.755 --> 33:52.088
Right.

33:52.090 --> 33:54.357
Where she met with
Waleed Mer-Khamis,

33:54.359 --> 33:56.793
my sources on the
ground tell me.

33:56.795 --> 33:58.828
I wouldn't know.

33:58.830 --> 34:00.296
Come on, Saul.

34:00.298 --> 34:03.032
Your protégé,
your golden child.

34:03.034 --> 34:06.035
No one believes for a minute
she's not still Agency.

34:06.037 --> 34:08.170
You can believe
what you want.

34:08.172 --> 34:11.974
The thing is,
Waleed is Hezbollah.

34:11.976 --> 34:15.478
Is America making common cause
with Syria and Iran?

34:15.480 --> 34:16.779
We are not and if we were,

34:16.781 --> 34:18.681
Israel would be
the first to know.

34:18.683 --> 34:22.452
We're old friends, Saul,
so you should know something.

34:22.454 --> 34:25.321
My government will
actively oppose

34:25.322 --> 34:28.358
any plans for regime change
in Damascus.

34:28.360 --> 34:32.295
First you accuse me
of cozying up to the enemy.

34:32.297 --> 34:35.498
Now I'm secretly
planning a coup in Syria.

34:35.500 --> 34:39.369
Getting rid of Bashar Al-Assad
is not a bad idea in itself.

34:39.371 --> 34:42.405
The danger is,
uh, replacing him

34:42.407 --> 34:44.407
with someone worse
than the original.

34:44.409 --> 34:47.577
I'm telling you that option
is not on the table.

34:47.579 --> 34:50.012
Truly?

34:50.014 --> 34:51.347
We're out of the business

34:51.349 --> 34:53.181
of overthrowing
Arab dictators, Etai.

34:53.184 --> 34:55.818
We have learned our lesson.

34:55.820 --> 34:57.487
Man:
Saul?

34:57.489 --> 34:59.856
Mr. Ambassador.

34:59.858 --> 35:01.691
I need to talk to you.

35:01.693 --> 35:03.326
Excuse us, Etai.

35:03.328 --> 35:05.595
Yes, of course.

35:11.403 --> 35:13.369
I'm being recalled.

35:13.371 --> 35:15.038
I heard.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.773
You didn't hear, Saul.

35:16.775 --> 35:18.308
You fucking engineered it.

35:18.310 --> 35:19.642
I presented
the administration

35:19.644 --> 35:20.944
with a set of choices.

35:20.946 --> 35:23.046
Well, just how dumb
do you think I am?

35:23.048 --> 35:25.381
You circled the wagons
around your own people.

35:25.383 --> 35:26.382
That's Allison's station.

35:26.384 --> 35:27.750
It's her responsibility.

35:27.752 --> 35:29.119
She's the one that
should pay for it.

35:29.121 --> 35:30.887
Well, Allison's a career
intelligence officer.

35:30.889 --> 35:32.122
What's your point?

35:32.124 --> 35:33.923
You own a string
of GM dealerships

35:33.925 --> 35:35.558
in Texas and Arkansas.

35:35.560 --> 35:36.726
Well, I'm not going back.

35:36.728 --> 35:38.294
I was promised four years here.

35:38.296 --> 35:40.630
I spent a small fortune
setting up my household.

35:40.632 --> 35:42.999
All right, take it up
with the State Department.

35:43.001 --> 35:45.168
It's the President
who owes me.

35:45.170 --> 35:49.172
Well, not as much as you
think he does, apparently.

35:50.742 --> 35:52.909
You do throw
a mean party, Scott.

35:52.911 --> 35:54.144
I'll give you that.

35:54.146 --> 35:58.148
Please say good-bye
to Anne for me.

35:58.150 --> 36:00.150
(Door opens)

36:12.364 --> 36:15.465
Where'd you get this?

36:15.467 --> 36:18.902
Freedom of Information Act.

36:20.605 --> 36:23.907
There are hundreds
of names here.

36:25.443 --> 36:28.378
167.

36:31.283 --> 36:33.349
All civilians.

36:33.351 --> 36:37.954
According to Pakistan's
Foreign Ministry, yeah.

36:37.956 --> 36:40.557
Killed by drones.

36:40.559 --> 36:43.126
Also missile strikes
and ground ops

36:43.128 --> 36:46.362
during my time
as Station Chief in Kabul.

36:52.237 --> 36:55.805
Um, so, let's cross-check
the surnames

36:55.807 --> 36:57.407
and see if anybody
from any of these families

36:57.409 --> 37:00.877
left to go fight jihad in Syria.

37:03.648 --> 37:05.882
Yeah.

37:07.419 --> 37:09.319
What's wrong?

37:09.321 --> 37:11.287
Nothing.

37:13.391 --> 37:15.592
You're tired.
You could use a break.

37:15.594 --> 37:16.993
I'm fine.

37:16.995 --> 37:18.761
Well, we've been at
it almost 14 hours.

37:18.763 --> 37:19.929
If you need a break,
just say so...

37:19.931 --> 37:22.131
Hey, I don't need a break!

37:28.607 --> 37:31.741
Something <i> is</i> wrong.

37:37.015 --> 37:39.782
Maybe I... I'm gonna
step outside for a minute.

37:39.784 --> 37:41.417
You're appalled.

37:41.419 --> 37:43.419
- No, I just need some air.
- No, you are-- you're appalled!

37:43.421 --> 37:44.454
You think I'm appalling.

37:44.456 --> 37:45.521
Leave it alone, Carrie.

37:45.523 --> 37:46.856
What then?!

37:46.858 --> 37:48.258
What, loathsome?

37:48.260 --> 37:51.361
Repulsive?
What, a war criminal?

37:57.535 --> 38:00.770
Say something for God's sake!

38:08.546 --> 38:11.414
(Door opens)

38:11.416 --> 38:12.715
Jonas, don't!

38:12.717 --> 38:14.550
This is not me anymore!

38:14.552 --> 38:15.985
None of it!

38:18.056 --> 38:20.823
I don't know how you live
with yourself.

38:22.727 --> 38:24.961

38:26.398 --> 38:28.364

38:49.587 --> 38:52.255

38:54.292 --> 38:57.894
(Breathing deeply)

39:25.357 --> 39:27.390
(Huffs)

39:27.392 --> 39:30.293
(Gasps)

39:42.807 --> 39:45.041
Fuck it.

39:50.048 --> 39:52.548
(Breathing deeply)

40:24.549 --> 40:26.582
(Opens bottle)

40:28.853 --> 40:31.354
Ah.

40:33.425 --> 40:35.858
Aayan:
So much for self-control, huh?

40:35.860 --> 40:39.529
Over here.

40:39.531 --> 40:42.198
Hey, Carrie.

41:08.593 --> 41:10.626
(Indistinct chatter)

41:22.073 --> 41:23.673
You are satisfied?

41:23.675 --> 41:25.241
Yes, yes. Good night.

41:25.243 --> 41:26.776
You're at the embassy,
right?

41:26.778 --> 41:29.312
Russian embassy?

41:31.015 --> 41:32.849
What are you
trying to do?

41:32.851 --> 41:34.250
Nothing.

41:34.252 --> 41:35.918
Huh?

41:35.920 --> 41:38.287
You threaten me?

41:38.289 --> 41:39.589
No.

41:39.591 --> 41:40.690
Blackmail?

41:40.692 --> 41:42.124
No.

41:42.126 --> 41:45.495
There's a business opportunity
for you.

41:45.497 --> 41:48.264
Business?

41:48.266 --> 41:51.033
You are a little
street rat.

41:51.035 --> 41:52.668
Something for sale.

41:52.670 --> 41:54.003
Documents.

41:54.005 --> 41:55.938
Top secret.

41:55.940 --> 41:58.508
American.

42:04.616 --> 42:07.350
Go on.

42:07.352 --> 42:10.686
You, you are a loose end,
you motherfucker.

42:10.688 --> 42:12.622
You, I'd go back for
in a heartbeat.

42:12.624 --> 42:15.157
Chase you down, fuck you up,
drop fire on your head.

42:15.159 --> 42:16.692
You hear that, asshole?

42:16.694 --> 42:18.694
Turn you into fucking smoke.

42:18.696 --> 42:20.696
Aayan:
It wasn't him.

42:25.136 --> 42:27.370
He didn't do it.

42:29.541 --> 42:32.542
He doesn't even remember you.

42:32.544 --> 42:34.744
You're nothing to him anymore.

42:34.746 --> 42:36.746
Not even a name.

42:41.886 --> 42:43.886
Aayan.

42:43.888 --> 42:46.222
Who the hell
is Aayan?

42:46.224 --> 42:47.757
Aayan is done.

42:47.759 --> 42:50.626
Aayan's... dust.

42:54.198 --> 42:56.198
What do you want?

42:56.200 --> 42:58.267
What do I want?

42:59.938 --> 43:01.270
Go on, ask me.

43:01.272 --> 43:03.339
I know you're dying to.

43:08.846 --> 43:10.846
(Faintly):
Who is it?

43:10.848 --> 43:12.815
Who's after me?

43:15.520 --> 43:18.588
Come closer,
I'll whisper in your ear.

on a-a canvas.

45:13.838 --> 45:15.738
Avenging angels.

45:15.740 --> 45:16.706
Carrie...

45:16.708 --> 45:18.240
No, angels aren't
all good, you know?

45:18.242 --> 45:22.011
Sometimes... sometimes
they come to punish,

45:22.013 --> 45:25.881
to tell you it's...
it's too much, the damage.

45:25.883 --> 45:28.417
So it doesn't matter
if it's Haqqani

45:28.419 --> 45:32.421
or, you know, Nazir's people
or Hasam's son.

45:32.423 --> 45:35.324
Whoever it is does it
for them all.

45:35.326 --> 45:38.494
And it's... and it's right.

45:38.496 --> 45:41.997
- It's... it's-it's righteous.
- Okay, okay, come on.

45:41.999 --> 45:43.833
- I mean, you can't... you can't atone...
- Let's get you up...

45:43.835 --> 45:46.836
...for that much blood,
for that many souls.

45:46.838 --> 45:49.338
It's futile,
absolution is not available.

45:49.340 --> 45:51.340
The angels are telling us that.

45:51.342 --> 45:52.341
Here, sit down.

45:52.343 --> 45:53.342
Do you understand?

45:53.344 --> 45:54.343
Yes, I understand.

45:54.345 --> 45:55.678
I'll be right back.

46:10.962 --> 46:12.862
Is there a church nearby?

46:12.864 --> 46:14.130
Uh, in the next village.

46:14.132 --> 46:15.431
I need to see a priest.

46:15.433 --> 46:16.932
Uh, you-you have to
take these first.

46:16.934 --> 46:17.933
- Now.
- Hey, hey.

46:17.935 --> 46:20.469
You have to take
these first.

46:20.471 --> 46:21.270
No.

46:21.272 --> 46:22.471
Come on.

46:22.473 --> 46:23.639
Why?

46:23.641 --> 46:25.141
- You think I'm crazy?!
- No, no, that was...

46:25.143 --> 46:28.544
No, no, no!
I am crystal fucking clear.

46:28.546 --> 46:29.879
I don't think
you're crazy.

46:29.881 --> 46:31.881
I think... I think
you solved this thing

46:31.883 --> 46:33.916
so it's time to go back
on your meds, okay?

46:33.918 --> 46:35.251
(Scoffs)

46:35.253 --> 46:36.819
- I'm not a moron.
- Nobody said you were.

46:36.821 --> 46:39.054
You don't think I know
what you're doing?

46:39.056 --> 46:40.389
No, no! No!

46:40.391 --> 46:42.725
I know exactly
what you're doing.

46:42.727 --> 46:44.560
I just want you to take
your pills like we agreed.

46:44.562 --> 46:46.095
- "Like we agreed."
- Yeah, we did.

46:46.097 --> 46:49.098
So patient, so reasonable.

46:49.100 --> 46:50.766
Jesus.

46:50.768 --> 46:53.636
Don't you ever get tired
of that Clark Kent routine?

46:53.638 --> 46:55.905
- Boring, boring, boring.
- You know what, fuck you.

46:55.907 --> 46:57.072
You can either take
these yourself...

46:57.074 --> 46:58.607
Or what?!

46:58.609 --> 47:00.409
What, you're gonna
shove 'em down my throat?

47:00.411 --> 47:02.111
No, I'm calling an ambulance.

47:02.113 --> 47:03.445
You can't do that.

47:03.447 --> 47:04.780
You know you can't do that.

47:04.782 --> 47:06.982
- They'll find us.
- Yeah, watch me.

47:09.487 --> 47:11.020
Take the pills
right now,

47:11.022 --> 47:13.022
or I start dialing.

47:16.360 --> 47:18.360
How about fucking
the bad girl instead?

47:18.362 --> 47:20.563
Take the goddamn pills!

47:28.105 --> 47:30.773
(Scoffs)

47:30.775 --> 47:33.008
You're a lousy lay anyway.

47:37.048 --> 47:38.581
Show me.

47:43.287 --> 47:45.454
I said show me.

47:53.030 --> 47:55.030
Thank you.

47:56.133 --> 47:59.468
Aw...

47:59.470 --> 48:01.804
Poor little Jonas.

48:01.806 --> 48:05.808
(Laughing): Bet you never had
a girlfriend like me before.

48:05.810 --> 48:07.476
Why don't you
stop talking now?

48:07.478 --> 48:09.211
Why? Why?
You sick of hearing my voice?

48:09.213 --> 48:11.046
- As a matter of fact, yes.
- Yeah, that's better.

48:11.048 --> 48:13.249
That's good. Get mad. I like it
better when you're mad.

48:13.251 --> 48:15.351
At least I know you're alive.
At least I know you have

48:15.353 --> 48:18.220
- a fucking pulse!
- Come on.

48:18.222 --> 48:20.389
- (Phone ringing, buzzing)
- Don't answer. Don't answer it.

48:20.391 --> 48:21.790
It's
the burner phone.

48:26.597 --> 48:28.097
It's my ex.

48:29.333 --> 48:31.667
Yeah.

48:31.669 --> 48:34.036
(Speaking German)

48:34.038 --> 48:35.104
<i>Was?</i>

48:35.106 --> 48:37.439
(Speaking German)

48:37.441 --> 48:38.540
Oh, my God.

48:38.542 --> 48:39.742
(Speaking German)

48:42.346 --> 48:44.513
(Jonas speaking German)

48:44.515 --> 48:45.781
(Speaking German)

48:45.783 --> 48:49.518
Jonas:
Okay, um... okay...

48:49.520 --> 48:52.087
(Speaking German)

48:52.089 --> 48:53.889
(Jana speaking German)

48:53.891 --> 48:55.357
<i>Ja, ja, ja, ja.</i>

48:55.359 --> 48:56.692
What's going on?

48:56.694 --> 48:58.193
Steffan's been arrested.

48:58.195 --> 48:59.762
For what?

48:59.764 --> 49:01.797
I don't know.
Shoplifting.

49:03.234 --> 49:06.635
(Speaking German)

49:11.651 --> 49:14.775
_

49:16.314 --> 49:19.148
(Door shuts)

49:25.823 --> 49:27.022
(Engine starts)

49:31.929 --> 49:33.128
(Speaking German)

49:36.300 --> 49:38.067
<i>Gut.</i>

49:38.069 --> 49:41.036
Okay.<i> Gut. Danke.</i>

49:42.673 --> 49:46.008
- Well, that's weird.
- What?

49:46.010 --> 49:51.480
Um, the police have no record of
him at any precinct in Berlin.

49:53.084 --> 49:56.352
That's because he's not
in police custody.

49:56.354 --> 49:58.153
What are you talking about?

49:58.155 --> 49:59.822
Shit, we have to go.
We have to go right now.

49:59.824 --> 50:01.357
- They're already on their way.
- Who?

50:01.359 --> 50:03.425
- Who is?
- Steffan's arrest

50:03.427 --> 50:06.996
was staged to generate that call
to you. We're blown.

50:06.998 --> 50:08.998
Are you saying these people
have Steffan?

50:09.000 --> 50:11.100
No, I am saying that
whoever is trying to kill me

50:11.102 --> 50:13.102
- is coming here!
- Do they have Steffan or not?

50:13.104 --> 50:15.437
- Steffan will be fine, trust me.
- How do you know that?

50:15.439 --> 50:17.139
You don't know.
You don't know that.

50:17.141 --> 50:20.009
- We have to get back to Berlin.
- No. No, no, no, no, Jonas.

50:20.011 --> 50:22.011
Jonas, listen to me, okay?
They won't hurt him.

50:22.013 --> 50:24.113
- He's just a pawn.
- Just a pawn?

50:24.115 --> 50:28.717
Are you fucking kidding me?!
He's my son!

50:36.894 --> 50:39.228
(Panting)

50:43.234 --> 50:46.969
Jonas:
Carrie!

50:46.971 --> 50:48.637
Come back!

50:48.639 --> 50:50.506
(Panting)

50:50.508 --> 50:53.909
I'm not chasing you!

51:05.523 --> 51:07.723
Carrie, goddamn it!
Where are you?!

51:15.366 --> 51:17.900
(Engine starts)

51:37.021 --> 51:38.320
(Click)

51:43.127 --> 51:45.260
The Ambassador's
on his way home.

51:45.262 --> 51:46.762
Not a happy camper.

51:46.764 --> 51:49.531
The Germans, however,
are appeased.

51:49.533 --> 51:50.699
Yes, they are.

51:50.701 --> 51:52.634
For the time being, at least.

51:52.636 --> 51:54.036
And Allison Carr?

51:54.038 --> 51:55.237
What about her?

51:55.239 --> 51:58.073
Do we put an official reprimand
in her file?

51:58.075 --> 51:59.975
Well, she did wander
outside the lines.

51:59.977 --> 52:01.777
Way outside.

52:01.779 --> 52:04.279
I have
a different interpretation.

52:04.281 --> 52:05.481
Which is?

52:05.483 --> 52:07.082
She misplayed badly.

52:07.084 --> 52:09.318
In the end got us
to the correct decision.

52:09.320 --> 52:12.621
Well, well, you're
in a forgiving mood today.

52:12.623 --> 52:14.890
Plus, I need her
for the weekend.

52:14.892 --> 52:16.792
Assuming we're still on.

52:16.794 --> 52:18.727
In fact, that's why I'm calling.

52:18.729 --> 52:21.230
Don't tell me. Cold feet.

52:21.232 --> 52:23.432
I fucking knew it.

52:23.434 --> 52:25.934
Actually, the opposite.

52:25.936 --> 52:27.569
What?

52:27.571 --> 52:31.673
And just when you thought
we'd lost our operational balls.

52:32.510 --> 52:34.643
We have a green light?

52:34.645 --> 52:36.979
We have a green light.

52:36.981 --> 52:38.580
However,
I did neglect to mention

52:38.582 --> 52:40.682
your conversation
with Etai Luskin.

52:40.684 --> 52:43.318
I'm sure you did.

52:43.320 --> 52:46.088
How detailed is their
intelligence, do you think?

52:46.090 --> 52:48.757
They know Assad's
in the crosshairs.

52:48.759 --> 52:51.827
They know we have a
likely candidate to replace him.

52:51.829 --> 52:53.829
Screw 'em.

52:53.831 --> 52:57.199
As long as they don't know
the who and the when.

52:57.201 --> 52:59.468
They don't.

52:59.470 --> 53:04.006
They got back on her when
she returned to her apartment...

53:04.008 --> 53:07.943
but they didn't have eyes-on
for over two hours.

53:09.380 --> 53:11.647
Two hours.

53:11.649 --> 53:14.383
Can you believe that?

53:14.385 --> 53:18.520
And these are supposed
to be professionals.

53:18.522 --> 53:20.189
For all we know,

53:20.191 --> 53:23.458
it's when she met with Carrie.

53:23.460 --> 53:26.195
And that's just the shit
that happened before lunch.

53:26.197 --> 53:30.933
I thought
my head was gonna explode.

53:33.737 --> 53:35.537
I took a Xanax.

53:35.539 --> 53:37.072
Yeah?

53:37.074 --> 53:40.309
I hope you don't mind
if we just go to sleep tonight.

53:40.311 --> 53:43.312
Not at all.

53:43.314 --> 53:46.148
I'm tired, too.
