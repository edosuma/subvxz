00:52.010 --> 00:53.011
FEBRUARY 22ND (MONDAY)

00:53.094 --> 00:54.971
-Kazunari Toda. Haruko Nomura.
-Here.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.389
-Kaori Hasebe.
-Here.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.058
-Koichi Hamada.
-Here.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.018
-Satoru Fujinuma.
-Here.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.644
-Kazuma Horiguchi.
-Here.

01:01.728 --> 01:02.562
Ma...

01:07.817 --> 01:09.194
Kayo, you're late again.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.448
-Yuko Matsumoto.
-Here.

01:13.531 --> 01:15.200
-Misato Yanagihara.
-Here.

01:15.283 --> 01:16.785
-Osamu Yamoto.
-Here.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.203
-Ami Yuki.
-Here.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.954
-Naoki Watanabe.
-Here.

01:20.538 --> 01:24.375
All right, we're at the start of
another week. Let's all study hard.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.418
Yes.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.297
<i>The reason Kayo is late on Mondays?</i>

01:29.881 --> 01:30.715
Yeah.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.426
Do you know why, Satoru?

01:34.177 --> 01:37.180
Because Saturdays are when
her mother hits her face.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.891
She has to wait until the marks fade.

01:41.518 --> 01:42.393
I see.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.063
Did you not notice anything?

01:45.647 --> 01:46.481
Well...

01:49.567 --> 01:52.904
I guess I can tell you the truth.
But don't tell anyone.

01:53.988 --> 01:54.948
I promise.

01:56.825 --> 02:00.995
I've reported it to Child Services,
but Kayo's mother is never home,

02:01.079 --> 02:03.706
so they haven't been able
to interview her.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.459
<i>What?</i>
<i>How could they be so useless?</i>

02:06.751 --> 02:08.961
But I'm sure she's abusing Kayo.

02:09.503 --> 02:11.589
We just need her mother to admit it.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.175
But once this happens...

02:15.718 --> 02:17.554
Kayo won't be able to stay here.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.975
I don't care as long as it means
Hinazuki is safe. Please hurry!

02:35.488 --> 02:39.492
FEBRUARY 23RD (TUESDAY)

02:46.124 --> 02:48.293
CLASS ATTENDANTS:
SATORU FUJINUMA, KAYO HINAZUKI

02:50.044 --> 02:52.005
Good morning, Hinazuki.

02:56.009 --> 02:56.843
Good morning.

03:06.978 --> 03:13.943
CLASS ATTENDANTS:
SATORU FUJINUMA, KAYO HINAZUKI

03:29.375 --> 03:31.085
Please be quiet.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.421
-Okay.
-I'm collecting lunch money now.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.131
Okay.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.601
You need a compass and ruler
for art tomorrow,

03:46.684 --> 03:48.686
so make sure you bring them.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.188
Okay.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.690
Did our assistants
collect lunch money?

03:52.774 --> 03:53.608
Yes.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.533
What's wrong, Satoru?

04:04.827 --> 04:05.745
Mr. Yashiro.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.166
I've lost everyone's lunch money.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.335
What?

04:13.002 --> 04:14.379
What? Why?

04:15.129 --> 04:15.964
Mr. Yashiro.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.968
I don't think it was lost.
I think it was stolen.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.931
I suspect Hinazuki.

04:27.475 --> 04:31.271
-Misato! What's your reason?
-Hinazuki's family is poor.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.189
She doesn't pay for lunch.

04:34.565 --> 04:37.443
I think we should look through
everyone's bags.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.112
I agree!

04:39.195 --> 04:40.947
She's right. Let's all look.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.448
Come on! Let's look!

04:46.786 --> 04:48.621
You're not looking, Kazu?

04:49.163 --> 04:52.125
Why would I if I didn't take it?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.847
See? I told you!

05:10.101 --> 05:13.563
Shut up! I don't care if she's poor,
Hinazuki wouldn't steal!

05:14.564 --> 05:16.816
Someone could be playing
a prank on her.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.533
All right, everyone.

05:26.075 --> 05:29.579
Kayo's a co-assistant, so it's
not strange she has the money.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.582
Okay, back to our end-of-day meeting.

05:49.932 --> 05:50.808
Fujinuma.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.061
Thanks for that.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.730
Don't mention it.
She was being really mean.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.402
She's hated me for a long time.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.782
But it wasn't always like that.

06:08.326 --> 06:11.454
One time she invited me
to a Christmas party.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.250
It was to show off
her big Christmas tree...

06:17.668 --> 06:18.795
But still...

06:19.462 --> 06:20.922
It was really beautiful.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.518
FEBRUARY 24TH, 1988 (WEDNESDAY)

06:38.481 --> 06:39.357
Hey.

06:40.817 --> 06:44.028
I'd like to go out next Saturday.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.573
Is it a date?

06:50.201 --> 06:52.620
We're all going skiing.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.499
Too bad. I would've
given you money for a date.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.416
Seriously?!

06:58.251 --> 06:59.418
So, it is a date.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.757
You should bring her by here, too.
We can have some stew.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.886
But Hinazuki is coming
for the birthday party.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.682
Oh, Hinazuki from District Five?

07:13.558 --> 07:16.936
<i>Crap. I fell for her leading questions.</i>

07:17.854 --> 07:20.690
<i>No surprise, coming from a</i>
<i>former Ishikari News employee.</i>

07:20.773 --> 07:22.733
Here. Be careful, okay?

07:22.817 --> 07:23.651
Thanks.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.197
<i>Are you guys free this Saturday?</i>

07:28.781 --> 07:31.784
-Saturday?
-Yeah. You guys want to go skiing?

07:32.785 --> 07:35.371
Oh, and Hinazuki will be coming, too.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.750
What's going on, Fujinuma?

07:43.671 --> 07:47.258
Sorry, Satoru.
I've already got plans for Saturday.

07:48.259 --> 07:51.345
Besides, I bet you'd rather be
alone with Hinazuki.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.263
Let's go.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.514
Yeah.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.599
Bye.

07:54.682 --> 07:55.516
Bye.

07:56.058 --> 07:57.643
Bye. Bye.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.191
What is it?

08:04.066 --> 08:05.067
Oh, Hinazuki.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.988
Saturday.
Come on a date with me.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.826
But Saturdays...

08:19.040 --> 08:21.292
My mom wants me home early
on Saturdays.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.755
There's somewhere I want to take you.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.633
I'll talk to her for you.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.136
Okay.

08:34.138 --> 08:37.933
I'd like to go somewhere with Hinazuki
this Saturday.

08:38.934 --> 08:39.769
No.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.313
Saturdays are when
Kayo helps around the house.

08:43.856 --> 08:47.610
I can help, too. Then you'd
let her go afterwards, won't you?

08:48.152 --> 08:49.862
I don't want your help.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.990
Why don't you want
Hinazuki leaving the house?

08:55.159 --> 08:57.119
I can think of several reasons.

08:58.204 --> 09:01.290
Why would you want to hang out
with someone so cold?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.752
I don't need a reason to save a friend.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.003
Save?

09:07.421 --> 09:08.256
Kayo.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.426
What do you want to do?
Do you want to go out with him?

09:19.934 --> 09:21.978
Get your head out of the clouds!

09:23.771 --> 09:27.024
That's no way to speak to children.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.526
Ms. Hinazuki.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.361
Ms. Fujinuma.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.947
This isn't your problem.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.950
Half of it is my problem.

09:36.659 --> 09:39.203
The children seem determined
to do something.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.249
We should support them...as their parents.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.921
Kayo, get inside.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.259
Kayo!

10:04.895 --> 10:08.691
-Should I have not done that?
-No, you were fine. Thank you.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.945
I'm glad I followed you
when I saw you walking by.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.363
You were following us?!

10:15.615 --> 10:17.575
I'm obviously just kidding!

10:18.701 --> 10:19.869
Anyway, Satoru.

10:21.871 --> 10:25.041
-You'd better not quit halfway.
-Obviously!

10:43.225 --> 10:45.811
Bye!

10:48.939 --> 10:51.233
FEBRUARY 27TH (SATURDAY)

10:53.903 --> 10:55.029
Hold on.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.825
Here. Gloves.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.497
It's cold in the mountains.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.290
Let's go.

11:09.543 --> 11:10.378
Bye!

11:12.380 --> 11:14.965
-How much further?
-We're almost there.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.178
This is a deer trail.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.693
Let's go.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.005
We're here. See?

12:00.469 --> 12:01.762
It's a Christmas tree.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.274
You stupid?

12:15.025 --> 12:16.068
It's February.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.451
I'm glad I came.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.991
Hinazuki. You look pretty today.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.868
-What?!
-Do you like her?!

13:05.951 --> 13:07.953
<i>Oh, I said it aloud.</i>

13:08.037 --> 13:11.373
What? No way!

13:11.624 --> 13:14.668
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning!

13:16.045 --> 13:17.880
All right, take your seats.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.926
I'm taking attendance.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.053
-Tokiko Asano.
-Here. -Yuji Arakawa.
-Here.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.014
-Yukari Ishizaki.
-Here.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.140
Yuuki Ueda.

13:28.641 --> 13:33.312
Idioms are a group of words
that have a different meaning

13:33.395 --> 13:36.482
from their respective definitions
when used together. It often uses a body part.

13:39.735 --> 13:40.736
FEBRUARY 29TH (MONDAY)

13:40.819 --> 13:42.821
Like your nose, ear, face, and head.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.367
For example, "face the music"
means confronting...

13:46.450 --> 13:49.620
<i>March 1st is the day Hinazuki</i>
<i>is supposed to be killed.</i>

13:50.162 --> 13:54.458
<i>If I can get through that day, then I</i>
<i>can stop the negative chain of events.</i>

13:58.587 --> 14:01.549
<i>My mother... won't have to be killed.</i>

14:03.968 --> 14:05.135
<i>But that's not all.</i>

14:06.345 --> 14:08.973
<i>I'll be able to save</i>
<i>a man awaiting execution</i>

14:09.807 --> 14:11.642
<i>in the world 18 years from now.</i>

14:14.144 --> 14:16.021
<i>I know Jun Shiratori as Yuuki.</i>

14:16.564 --> 14:18.899
<i>In September 1989,</i>

14:19.441 --> 14:23.195
<i>he was arrested on suspicion</i>
<i>of serial kidnapping and murder.</i>

14:23.279 --> 14:25.406
<i>He's always proclaimed his innocence.</i>

14:25.865 --> 14:26.949
All right, done.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.160
Here.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.162
Thank you.

14:32.788 --> 14:36.292
Now you have to remember
to adjust the curve when you fly it.

14:43.507 --> 14:44.341
Satoru.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.761
Seems like you've made a lot of friends.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.890
It's because I did what you said.

14:51.098 --> 14:54.685
No, it's because you got up the courage,
Satoru.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.122
<i>March 1st.</i>

15:17.166 --> 15:20.669
<i>In my first life...</i>
<i>it's the day Kayo was killed.</i>

15:23.964 --> 15:26.634
Hey, let's go
to the science center after this.

15:28.552 --> 15:32.765
-I kind of want to get home early today.
-Come on, keep me company.

15:36.018 --> 15:36.852
Okay.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.777
TOMAKOMAI CITY SCIENCE CENTER

15:49.657 --> 15:52.451
I've always loved this place
since I was little.

15:58.749 --> 16:02.544
<i>Hinazuki was targeted</i>
<i>because she was always alone.</i>

16:03.629 --> 16:05.965
<i>But not this time.</i>

16:08.759 --> 16:10.094
<i>She has me by her side.</i>

16:21.981 --> 16:25.693
So, I guess aspiring manga writers...
like places like this?

16:27.486 --> 16:28.320
Yeah.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.189
-Bye, then.
-Yeah.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.446
I'll see you tomorrow. I'll come pick you up.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.538
Bye, then! See you tomorrow!

17:21.749 --> 17:22.583
Bye.

17:35.137 --> 17:39.099
<i>The first time I lived this day,</i>
<i>I saw Hinazuki at the park.</i>

17:49.568 --> 17:52.488
<i>But... I didn't call out to her.</i>

18:22.476 --> 18:25.104
<i>That's why... I did today.</i>

18:26.522 --> 18:29.691
<i>I talked to Hinazuki. And her mother.</i>

18:31.068 --> 18:31.902
<i>And...</i>

18:32.236 --> 18:35.739
<i>whoever might be listening nearby.</i>

18:46.291 --> 18:47.126
Yes!

18:49.002 --> 18:50.712
<i>I've changed history!</i>

19:16.697 --> 19:19.032
MARCH 2ND, 1988

19:19.116 --> 19:19.950
Ready?

19:20.033 --> 19:22.661
Happy Birthday, Satoru, Hinazuki!

19:22.744 --> 19:24.872
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SATORU, KAYO
AND MARRIAGE?

19:27.082 --> 19:28.417
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.961
Here come the cakes!

19:31.628 --> 19:33.380
They look delicious!

19:33.463 --> 19:35.674
So, I guess you had the same birthday!

19:42.890 --> 19:44.016
HAPPY BIRTHDAY KAYO

19:57.362 --> 19:59.740
Congratulations!

20:03.869 --> 20:05.078
Here's your presents.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.914
We're giving presents already?

20:07.623 --> 20:09.541
Here, here's mine. Here you go.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.918
-Thanks!
-Here you go.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.921
-Here, Satoru, happy birthday.
-Thanks!

20:14.922 --> 20:17.299
-Here, happy birthday.
-Thanks!

20:17.883 --> 20:19.301
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks!

20:19.384 --> 20:20.302
Thank you.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.388
Here, this is from me.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.098
Happy birthday.

20:28.685 --> 20:29.770
Open it.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.882
Sorry, Fujinuma... I...

20:59.675 --> 21:01.969
I couldn't make your present in time.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.639
Don't worry about it.
Give it to me later.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.561
Well, who's ready for some cake?

21:13.981 --> 21:17.651
-Make mine a big piece please.
-You want a big one? All right!

21:49.725 --> 21:53.228
<i>It was my first birthday party, too.</i>

21:54.771 --> 21:56.231
<i>Having friends...</i>

21:57.816 --> 21:58.900
<i>is fun.</i>

22:35.812 --> 22:39.816
<i>We all hung out until it got late.</i>
<i>And I walked Hinazuki home.</i>

22:51.244 --> 22:52.370
I'm really happy...

22:53.872 --> 22:54.956
that I was able...

22:56.917 --> 23:00.045
to become friends with...
you and everyone.

23:07.385 --> 23:08.553
Thank you for today.

23:10.263 --> 23:12.641
I'll give you your present tomorrow.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.226
Okay.

23:14.643 --> 23:15.602
I promise.

23:28.949 --> 23:29.783
See you! See you!

23:43.922 --> 23:45.006
Yes!

23:51.638 --> 23:54.891
<i>I felt all the tension</i>
<i>built up inside me suddenly relax,</i>

23:54.975 --> 23:57.227
<i>and I fell right to sleep.</i>

24:27.132 --> 24:29.467
-Naoki Watanabe.
-Here.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.012
-Good morning!
-Just in the nick of time.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.599
I guess that leaves Kayo
as the only one still late.

24:40.061 --> 24:42.105
What is it, Satoru? Take your seat.

24:43.690 --> 24:44.524
Okay.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.530
Today's March 3rd. Oh, the Hina Festival.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.201
Are some of you girls
having a party tonight?

24:54.576 --> 24:55.869
I guess the boys, too.

24:55.952 --> 24:59.539
Some boys might be excited
about a party if you have a sister.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.458
But let's stay focused today.

25:01.541 --> 25:02.751
Yes.

25:03.168 --> 25:06.880
<i>Hinazuki...</i>
<i>never showed up to school that day.</i>
