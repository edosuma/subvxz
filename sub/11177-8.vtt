- How long was I on the phone?
- Twenty-five minutes.

00:36.591 --> 00:39.754
With the cell phone charges,
I'm gonna round it out to about an hour...

00:39.860 --> 00:42.590

What are you doing? Pilates?

Uh, yes, of course we remember...

She's fine. Our daughter's all right,
everybody, so...

- You said you didn't want her to come.
- I said I didn't want <i>you</i> to come.

04:06.801 --> 04:10.464
- Oh, that makes more sense.
- Now she's going to think
we're totally self-involved.

I can fix this.
Buster's probably still in the lobby.

No, Mom. Tobias and I

- Forget it.

Fine. I'll ask Michael.
He'll give it to me.

a "stay-in-bed mom."

- I thought it was harsh.

you're completely irresponsible.

04:51.212 --> 04:53.840

09:59.720 --> 10:01.950
Listen, can I talk to you alone
for a moment?

10:02.055 --> 10:05.491
- <i>I'll leave you two alone here.</i>
- Oh, no, George Michael, I meant you.

10:05.592 --> 10:08.152
Maeby, can we have the room?

10:11.899 --> 10:15.858
So, as you know, I was hoping
to play Adam in this thing...

10:15.969 --> 10:19.996
and I want you to know
that I am not threatened.

10:20.107 --> 10:22.371
You know, I'd be happy
to let you play Adam.

10:22.476 --> 10:24.569
Give me the suit.
Give me the suit.

10:24.678 --> 10:28.341
I'm actually wearing it right now,
and I can't tell you why.

10:28.448 --> 10:30.348
You're wearing it right now?

10:30.450 --> 10:33.180
I have to wear it all the time.
You'd never understand.

10:33.287 --> 10:36.654
Oh, please.
I'll never under...

10:36.757 --> 10:40.523
I'll never understand...
that you can never be nude?

10:46.800 --> 10:50.759
I understand more than
you'll <i>never</i> know.

10:57.277 --> 10:59.177
Yikes.

10:59.279 --> 11:01.713
<i>[Narrator] Michael finally arranged</i>
<i>a meeting with attorney WayneJarvis.</i>

11:01.815 --> 11:03.715
Looking for a more professional approach
to our representation.

11:03.817 --> 11:05.114
Well, I'm a professional.

11:05.219 --> 11:08.211
- I'm serious, and I'm a professional.
- That's fantastic.

11:08.322 --> 11:10.756
- So how long have you been practicing...
- I also don't like small talk.

11:10.857 --> 11:14.190
I find that unprofessional.
Why should I be billing you for small talk...

11:14.294 --> 11:16.194
when I'm enjoying it
as much as you are?

11:16.296 --> 11:19.356
Then this must be a freebie
'cause I'm having a ball.

11:19.466 --> 11:21.866
{ Chuckles] When you're ready
to get serious, give me a call.

11:21.969 --> 11:26.429
No, no! No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm serious. I'm ready.

11:26.540 --> 11:30.408
Good. If you retain my services,
I will get your father out of jail...

11:30.510 --> 11:32.410
and we will be countersuing
before the end of the year.

11:32.512 --> 11:35.208
We're gonna get this company's name
back to where it started.

11:35.315 --> 11:37.875
- Or hopefully higher.
- I didn't say that. Don't hold me to that.

11:37.985 --> 11:41.785
I won't, and I appreciate that
to a wonderful degree.

11:41.888 --> 11:44.288
My mother is on her way up here...

11:44.391 --> 11:48.088
and she's resistant
to the idea of hiring a new attorney.

11:48.195 --> 11:50.663
If she even sees you,
she probably won't come in the room.

11:50.764 --> 11:53.289
I shall duck behind the couch.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.834
- What a pro.
- <i>[Bell Dings]</i>

11:57.137 --> 11:58.695
- Michael.
- Hi.

11:58.805 --> 12:02.036
I need to get the money
to get your father out for the pageant.

12:02.142 --> 12:05.578
Actually, that's not why
I called you here today, and I'm not doing that.

12:05.679 --> 12:08.273
I gave that money to Lindsay
to pay off her credit card debt.

12:08.382 --> 12:11.840
- What'd she do, get you drunk?
- No, we just, uh, well...

12:11.952 --> 12:14.614
We did drink a little bit.
How'd you know that?

12:14.721 --> 12:16.621
Because that's what
she said she'd do.

12:16.723 --> 12:19.851
I said you wouldn't give her the money,
and she said, "He will if I get him drunk."

12:19.960 --> 12:22.258
Probably because she thinks
you're a cheap bastard.

12:22.362 --> 12:24.353
Oh. Her words.

12:24.464 --> 12:26.432
She set me up?

12:26.533 --> 12:31.266
All that stuff about her marital troubles
and Tobias being a never-nude?

12:31.371 --> 12:35.273
A never-nude?
I thought he just liked cutoffs.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.434
How do you treat somebody
in your own family like that...

12:37.544 --> 12:41.913
lying and deceiving and saying anything
just to get your own way?

12:42.015 --> 12:44.779
- So what did you want to see me about?
- Hmm?

12:44.885 --> 12:48.446
Oh, um, there's a big bowl
of candy in my office.

12:48.555 --> 12:51.285
- Why don't you go eat it?
- <i>WayneJarvis, attorney at law.</i>

12:51.391 --> 12:55.725
I have a responsibility to tell you
that there is no candy in this office.

12:55.829 --> 12:58.320
Lindsay.

13:03.537 --> 13:06.370
- What are you doing here?
- I had to get away from Marta.

13:06.473 --> 13:11.308
<i>If I have to smell another meal of fish,</i>
<i>rice and mango, I'm gonna kill somebody.</i>

13:11.411 --> 13:14.972
- Now Michael's learning Spanish.
What's up with that?
- Oh, who knows?

13:15.082 --> 13:16.982
He won't get your father
out of jail for a night.

13:17.084 --> 13:19.644
- He's bringing in a new attorney.
- <i>New attorney?</i>

13:19.753 --> 13:22.688
And he's learning Spanish?

13:22.789 --> 13:24.780
He's hiding something.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.519
And I intend to find out what it is.

13:27.627 --> 13:31.222
Do yourself a favor.
Get him drunk.

13:37.471 --> 13:39.496
{ Scoffs]
Barry.

13:40.841 --> 13:43.275
I see you're getting closer
to our attorney.

13:43.377 --> 13:47.006
<i>Well, I just want you to know</i>
<i>that I won't be needing your help after all.</i>

13:47.114 --> 13:51.813
My brother Michael came through
as he always does and as you never do.

13:51.918 --> 13:55.877
Whatever it takes to get your relationship
with that never-nude back on track.

13:57.991 --> 14:00.357
- Michael told you that?
- He couldn't wait to.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.826
<i>[Narrator] And later,</i>
<i>while Michael was meeting with Wayne</i>...

14:02.929 --> 14:06.262
My thing with Tobias was a secret
like you stealing your brother's girlfriend!

14:06.366 --> 14:09.062
- I open up to you, and you run and tell Mommy!
- Excuse me.

14:09.169 --> 14:11.034
Outside, please.
Thank you. Pardon us.

14:11.138 --> 14:14.801
Like it all wasn't just lies to get me to pay
that debt. Isn't that why you got me drunk?

14:14.908 --> 14:17.035
- I <i>got</i> you drunk.
- Mom told me about your little plan.

14:17.144 --> 14:20.409
- What plan? I had a great time last night!
- So did I!

14:20.514 --> 14:22.880
- Then why are we yelling at each other?
- Mom.

14:22.983 --> 14:26.384
- Unbelievable.
- She did it again.

14:26.486 --> 14:29.387
- All right. We've got to teach her a lesson.
- Hmm.

14:30.724 --> 14:34.626
<i>Excuse me, Wayne, my sister and I were</i>
<i>outside having a business discussion...</i>

14:34.728 --> 14:37.253
and we were wondering
if there's some sort of legal way...

14:37.364 --> 14:40.094
that we can humiliate our mother.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.566
Something shaming, something public.

14:42.669 --> 14:45.832
I've used one adjective to describe myself.
What is it?

14:45.939 --> 14:47.907
Professional.

14:54.681 --> 14:56.581
So how are we going to screw Mom?

14:56.683 --> 14:58.344
- Maybe we can get Barry to help.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

14:58.452 --> 15:01.512
I think I was right about them all along.
You know Barry's taking Mom to the pageant?

15:01.621 --> 15:03.350
- On a date?
- Yeah.

15:03.457 --> 15:08.827
Ugh! If Dad could see her
on a date with Barry, he'd go crazy.

15:08.929 --> 15:11.625
<i>Which would allow us to hire Wayne.</i>

15:13.500 --> 15:16.526
How do you feel about staying in debt
just a little bit longer?

15:16.636 --> 15:20.037
<i>[Narrator] So they decided to spend</i>
<i>the money Michael had promised Lindsay...</i>

15:20.140 --> 15:24.167
<i>to get their father out for the pageant,</i>
<i>where he'd catch his wife with Barry.</i>

15:24.277 --> 15:27.838
<i>Maeby, too, continued to try</i>
<i>to teach her parents a lesson.</i>

15:27.948 --> 15:30.508
Okay, so I printed the fake airline ticket
from my computer.

15:30.617 --> 15:34.109
If my parents miss this,
I really might go to South America.

15:34.221 --> 15:36.781
- That says "Portugal."
- That's right.

15:36.890 --> 15:41.020
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Maeby's parents didn't find the ticket,</i>
<i>but Gob did</i>...

15:41.127 --> 15:43.027
"Portugal."

15:43.129 --> 15:45.461
<i>which confirmed his suspicions.</i>

15:45.565 --> 15:48.159
Gonna live it up down old
South America way, huh, Mikey?

15:48.268 --> 15:51.567
<i>And Buster finally gave in</i>
<i>to Lucille 2's wishes.</i>

15:51.671 --> 15:55.072
You ready to show me off
before God and the whole world?

15:55.175 --> 15:57.370
It's not my dad's reaction
I'm worried about.

15:57.477 --> 16:01.573
<i>And George Michael finally saw the painting</i>
<i>he was going to be re-creating.</i>

16:01.681 --> 16:05.344
<i>?? [Hip-hop]</i>

16:05.452 --> 16:08.979
<i>And then what "frontspiece"meant.</i>

16:14.995 --> 16:19.932
<i>George Sr. got his 24 hours of freedom</i>
<i>as the pageant finally began.</i>

16:20.033 --> 16:23.764
You know, I saw you do this when I was a kid.
I was so impressed.

16:23.870 --> 16:27.806
You know, you were
so still and godlike.

16:27.908 --> 16:30.274
It was at that moment
that I knew I would be a dancer.

16:31.845 --> 16:33.745
Glad I could make a difference.

16:33.847 --> 16:36.509
<i>Michael and Lindsay searched the crowd</i>
<i>for their mother and Barry...</i>

16:36.616 --> 16:40.074
<i>so they could revel in the public shaming</i>
<i>they had engineered.</i>

16:40.186 --> 16:44.122
- Mom, what the hell are you doing?
- <i>But instead they found her with Wayne.</i>

16:44.224 --> 16:46.124
I don't have to answer that.

16:46.226 --> 16:48.387
I don't know which one of you
I'm more disappointed in.

16:48.495 --> 16:50.520
No, it's Wayne. Wayne...

16:50.630 --> 16:53.258
- I have needs. I am a man!
- Hey, watch...

16:53.366 --> 16:56.130
What's the difference?
Your father doesn't care about me.

16:56.236 --> 16:58.727
Barry tells me he's not even trying
to get out of prison.

16:58.838 --> 17:01.602
- Mom, he's here. Dad's here.
- He's here?

17:01.708 --> 17:04.040
- Yeah, he's here.
- Why did you do this?

17:04.144 --> 17:06.476
- We were trying to teach you a lesson.
- <i>You idiots.!</i>

17:06.579 --> 17:09.708
- If he sees me with Wayne...
- We'll be stuck with Barry.
