01:58.184 --> 02:00.050
(laughs)

02:00.117 --> 02:02.484
You've fallen right
into my trap,

02:02.551 --> 02:04.017
just like you
did in Africa.

02:04.850 --> 02:06.284
Krusty, there you are.

02:06.351 --> 02:07.484
We've got business
to discuss.

02:07.551 --> 02:08.550
First off,

02:08.618 --> 02:09.850
we got big problems

02:09.917 --> 02:11.750
with your talking
home pregnancy tests.

02:13.317 --> 02:15.683
Hey-hey, you're pregnant
and it's not mine!

02:15.750 --> 02:17.417
(laughing)

02:17.484 --> 02:20.084
It's giving 20%
false "hey-heys."

02:20.151 --> 02:23.584
Oh, okay, uh,
repackage them

02:23.650 --> 02:25.984
as coffee stirrers and sell
them in the Philippines.

02:26.050 --> 02:28.151
Genius.
Now, another issue:

02:28.217 --> 02:30.017
Studies show
your Krusty Burger

02:30.084 --> 02:33.417
is the unhealthiest fast-food
item in the world.

02:33.484 --> 02:35.351
Worse than
the Double Krusty Burger?

02:35.417 --> 02:36.618
Somehow, yes.

02:38.384 --> 02:39.783
Okay, here's what we do.

02:39.850 --> 02:42.451
What's that food we never
put in any of our meals?

02:42.518 --> 02:44.151
Vegetables?
Yeah, those guys.

02:44.217 --> 02:45.917
Find the cheapest one,

02:45.984 --> 02:47.417
and make a burger
out of it.

02:47.484 --> 02:49.717
Then throw it in a green
wrapper and double the price.

02:49.783 --> 02:51.551
And say it's got
none of those, uh,

02:51.618 --> 02:54.117
what are those unhealthy
he-she sounding things?

02:54.184 --> 02:55.551
Uh, trans fats?

02:55.618 --> 02:57.650
That's it!
And while you're in there,

02:57.717 --> 03:00.017
spray a little nicotine juice
on the kids' meals.

03:00.084 --> 03:01.351
Get 'em hooked.
(laughs)

03:05.084 --> 03:07.750
ANNOUNCER:
Coming up on:

03:07.817 --> 03:09.984
(crewman shouting)

03:10.050 --> 03:12.618
(grunting)

03:12.683 --> 03:14.817
It was worth it
to be on TV!

03:14.884 --> 03:16.717
Put our dying screams
in the promo!

03:16.783 --> 03:18.384
(both screaming)

03:20.484 --> 03:21.750
You know, kids,

03:21.817 --> 03:25.717
the real drowningest
catch is man.

03:35.317 --> 03:38.017
It's a new world out there.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.817
People care about their health,
for some reason.

03:40.884 --> 03:42.750
<i>We know times have changed.</i>

03:42.817 --> 03:46.584
<i>And we at Krusty Burger want
to take advantage of that.</i>

03:46.650 --> 03:49.351
<i>Introducing...
the Mother Nature Burger.</i>

03:49.417 --> 03:51.917
<i>Made from 100%
wheat-fed barley.</i>

03:51.984 --> 03:54.117
And now to take a yummy bite.

03:57.217 --> 04:01.017
Mmm... tastes like
a healthy future.

04:07.917 --> 04:09.884
We're going
to Krusty Burger!

04:14.151 --> 04:16.517
Finally, a hamburger
for the Hindus.

04:17.950 --> 04:20.117
By the tusks of great Ganesh,

04:20.184 --> 04:22.284
now no one can tell
I am not American.

04:22.351 --> 04:24.217
(sitar music plays, Apu chants)

04:27.750 --> 04:29.151
Look at me!
I'm saving the Earth!

04:30.451 --> 04:32.518
Where's my Nobel prize?

04:35.217 --> 04:36.384
(bubbly rumbling)

04:37.984 --> 04:40.783
What's wrong, old friend?
Can't sleep?

04:40.850 --> 04:42.584
(rumbling continues)
Aww.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.850
Would some warm beer
settle you down?

04:44.917 --> 04:47.384
(rumbling continues)
Uh-oh.

04:49.584 --> 04:51.484
Those barley burgers
were tainted!

04:51.551 --> 04:54.351
Why did I eat 12 of them? Why?!

04:55.184 --> 04:56.884
Taken!

04:57.917 --> 04:59.750
Occupied!

05:00.783 --> 05:02.884
Hurling!

05:12.017 --> 05:13.050
(muffled):
Uh-oh.

05:13.117 --> 05:14.518
(teachers and kids groaning)

05:14.584 --> 05:16.117
SKINNER (over P.A.):
Attention, students,

05:16.184 --> 05:18.017
due to the recent
queasiness,

05:18.084 --> 05:20.184
both the Presidential
Ab-Crunch Challenge

05:20.251 --> 05:22.650
and the Sloppy Joe-A-Thon
have been cancelled.

05:22.717 --> 05:23.717
(weakly):
Skinner!

05:23.783 --> 05:25.117
If I die,

05:25.184 --> 05:27.451
I want you to take over...
Really?

05:27.518 --> 05:30.351
...the search committee
for a new superintendent.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.850
Mm...

05:31.917 --> 05:34.783
Just hold my head and
say soothing things.

05:34.850 --> 05:37.950
Third-grade math scores
are holding steady.

05:38.017 --> 05:40.284
Ah, yes...

05:40.351 --> 05:41.984
The food poisoning
has been traced

05:42.050 --> 05:44.584
to a single ingredient:
tainted barley.

05:44.650 --> 05:46.484
And where does that
barley come from?

05:46.551 --> 05:49.384
Our neighbor to the southeast,
Ogdenville.

05:49.451 --> 05:51.384
The state's barley basket
since it was settled

05:51.451 --> 05:53.451
100 years ago,
by Norwegian immigrants.

05:53.518 --> 05:56.484
I'm here with barley farmer
Brendlf Jensen. Brendlf?

05:56.551 --> 05:59.117
What happened is,
a big ol' rat got caught up

05:59.184 --> 06:02.950
in the grinders there, so my
wife, Dagny, took a hose to it.

06:03.017 --> 06:04.984
And, uh, it's all
cleaned out now.

06:05.050 --> 06:06.984
So you're
guaranteeing it's safe

06:07.050 --> 06:09.050
to eat Ogdenville barley
once more?

06:09.117 --> 06:12.184
Well, where there's barley,
there's rats, you know.

06:12.251 --> 06:14.518
Now, when will you
be starting the interview?

06:14.584 --> 06:16.050
That just went out live.

06:16.117 --> 06:18.917
Well, then we're screwed.

06:30.783 --> 06:32.783
(slow, melancholy
orchestral theme playing)

07:03.700 --> 07:05.001
Dad, are you
sure you can

07:05.067 --> 07:07.234
put in these new rain
gutters all by yourself?

07:07.301 --> 07:08.533
Eh, maybe you're right.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.734
I do have a bad history
of going up on roofs

07:10.800 --> 07:12.400
and waking up in hospitals.

07:12.467 --> 07:14.533
Perhaps we could be
of help, don't you know.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.268
Ogdenvillians?
Work on my house?

07:17.334 --> 07:19.334
<i>Ja. Ever since
the barley bust,</i>

07:19.400 --> 07:21.368
the only work we can get
is day labor.

07:21.433 --> 07:24.368
We don't mind it.
Work is work.

07:24.433 --> 07:26.834
I like your
can-do attitude!

07:26.901 --> 07:30.400
And your facial hair screams
rugged but reliable.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.767
You won't regret
this, sir.

07:31.834 --> 07:32.901
You hear that, Bart?

07:32.967 --> 07:34.368
He called me "sir."

07:34.433 --> 07:36.867
That means he knows
I'm better than him.

07:39.034 --> 07:41.600
Nicely done, guys.
Lemonade?

07:41.667 --> 07:43.634
A lemon version
of barley-ade?

07:43.700 --> 07:45.467
(chuckles):
When in Springfield...

07:45.533 --> 07:48.301
Oh, don't that glug
down right good then.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.268
<i>Oh, ja, almost
as good as barley-ade.</i>

07:50.334 --> 07:51.867
<i>Mm-hmm.
Oh, ja. Oh, ja.</i>

07:51.934 --> 07:53.500
You know, I'm glad
you've come here

07:53.567 --> 07:55.334
to take all the jobs
we don't want to do.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.134
Can't have too much
of a good thing.

08:02.301 --> 08:03.834
OGDENVILLIAN:
You fellas, too, come on!

08:07.433 --> 08:09.301
<i>( music playing throughout )</i>

08:09.967 --> 08:13.001
<i>( women vocalizing )</i>

08:34.317 --> 08:36.549
So, Inga, this
is our kitchen.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.250
Did you have kitchens
back in Ogdenville?

08:39.317 --> 08:42.051
<i>Ja, before the dark days
fell on my people</i>

08:42.118 --> 08:43.650
and we lost everything.

08:43.717 --> 08:46.817
Great! So you know your
way around a blender.

08:46.884 --> 08:48.984
Okay, so if the dog's
in the house,

08:49.051 --> 08:51.550
don't let Grampa
in and vice versa.

08:51.617 --> 08:54.984
Our neighbor, Ned Flanders,
drops by unexpectedly.

08:55.051 --> 08:56.984
That I do!
But he doesn't stay long.

08:57.051 --> 08:58.250
No, I don't!

08:58.317 --> 09:01.051
Kids, this is Inga,
your new nanny.

09:01.118 --> 09:02.951
A nanny? Whoo-hoo!

09:03.018 --> 09:04.684
Mom says I can have ice cream
for breakfast.

09:04.751 --> 09:05.884
Oh, she's still here.

09:05.951 --> 09:07.150
Mom, can I have
ice cream for breakfast?

09:07.217 --> 09:08.717
No way, mister.

09:08.784 --> 09:11.584
It's just chocolate chip
pancakes and syrup for you.

09:11.651 --> 09:14.051
Inga, I'll be happy
to eat whatever you make.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.150
(frustrated grunt)

09:16.217 --> 09:18.817
Maggie, now you have a nanny.

09:18.884 --> 09:20.684
Just like the ones
Joe Piscopo

09:20.751 --> 09:22.951
and Ethan Hawke
left their wives for.

09:23.018 --> 09:24.917
But hands off my Homie.

09:24.984 --> 09:28.350
Hands off the Homie.
Got it.

09:28.417 --> 09:29.484
(whimpers)

09:29.550 --> 09:31.350
Sorry, sometimes
she's nervous

09:31.417 --> 09:32.584
around new people.

09:32.651 --> 09:34.617
Actually,
she's just gassy.

09:34.684 --> 09:37.350
A little lingonberry oil
under the tongue will clear it

09:37.417 --> 09:39.584
right up.
(Maggie coos, burbles)

09:39.651 --> 09:41.817
That's amazing!

09:41.884 --> 09:45.018
Now I feel bad about
calling your references.

09:47.217 --> 09:49.350
So Selma,
how did you meet?

09:49.417 --> 09:51.283
I hired Torbjorn, here,

09:51.350 --> 09:52.917
to kill some moles
in my garden.

09:52.984 --> 09:56.018
And, well, one thing
led to another...

09:56.084 --> 09:58.183
<i>Ja, she has the same
beautiful face</i>

09:58.250 --> 10:00.984
as my great-uncle Magnus
when he lay in the coffin

10:01.051 --> 10:02.717
after his trolley
accident.

10:02.784 --> 10:04.717
Gee, this
Ogdenville influx

10:04.784 --> 10:06.617
has been great
for everybody.

10:06.684 --> 10:11.217
Yeah, talk about taking jobs
Springfield don't want!

10:11.283 --> 10:13.150
(laughs)
Hey, Homer, your blubber

10:13.217 --> 10:15.350
would light our
lamps for a year.
D'oh!

10:15.417 --> 10:16.617
I zing the oaf good?

10:16.684 --> 10:19.550
You zing the oaf great.

10:23.584 --> 10:26.384
Minnesota Vikings apparel?!

10:26.450 --> 10:28.717
This is Tennessee
Titans country!

10:30.717 --> 10:31.617
Waah!

10:35.917 --> 10:38.717
Uff da!
So many meters.

10:38.784 --> 10:40.150
(kids agreeing)

10:40.217 --> 10:41.884
Step aside, Nor-wads.

10:41.951 --> 10:43.751
Watch how the natives ride sky.

10:43.817 --> 10:44.851
(The Chantays'
"Pipeline" begins)

10:56.350 --> 10:58.217
(yells)

11:01.384 --> 11:02.884
(groans)

11:06.717 --> 11:09.717
Three hours and we still
can't see a doctor?!

11:09.784 --> 11:12.684
It's 'cause it's filled
with all these Nor-wads.

11:12.751 --> 11:14.384
They even sneeze funny.

11:14.450 --> 11:18.150
(sneezing):
A-fer-gan-nerkin!
A-fer-gan-nerkin!

11:18.217 --> 11:20.651
We're out of English forms.

11:20.717 --> 11:22.617
You'll have to fill out
a Norwegian one.

11:22.684 --> 11:26.450
I can't read this
sloopy-bloopy writing.

11:26.517 --> 11:29.283
Typical-- foreigners
clogging up the system.

11:29.350 --> 11:31.951
I hurt my back unclogging
your septic system.

11:32.018 --> 11:33.684
Sven, can you stop
by tomorrow?

11:33.751 --> 11:35.051
<i>It's clogged again.
Ja.</i>

11:35.118 --> 11:36.484
Come on, Bart.

11:36.550 --> 11:38.283
We'll take care
of you at home.

11:38.350 --> 11:42.018
(sneezing):
Na-chin-na-hart!
Na-chin-na-hart!

11:42.084 --> 11:44.250
Oh great, I
caught their cold.

11:45.717 --> 11:46.951
Okay, Bart.

11:47.018 --> 11:50.084
Now bite down on the
rubber dog bone, and...

11:50.150 --> 11:51.717
(toy squeaks,
bone snaps)

11:51.784 --> 11:52.817
Mm!

11:52.884 --> 11:54.384
(barks)

11:54.450 --> 11:55.951
Thanks, Mom.

11:56.018 --> 11:58.417
Now, how did this
happen again?

11:58.484 --> 11:59.884
It wasn't my fault.
I swear.

11:59.951 --> 12:02.217
A couple of barleyjerks
dared me to.

12:02.283 --> 12:04.751
Yeah, well, I'm starting
to wonder if this town

12:04.817 --> 12:07.450
wasn't better off before all
these immigrants showed up.

12:07.517 --> 12:09.051
I'd just like to remind you

12:09.118 --> 12:10.884
that we were all immigrants
at one time.

12:10.951 --> 12:12.484
Well, you were a baby once.

12:12.550 --> 12:14.417
Does that mean you still
like milk and hugs?

12:14.484 --> 12:16.217
Yes, I'd like both right now.

12:20.118 --> 12:21.051
(grunts)

12:21.118 --> 12:22.517
Hey, this is all right.

12:22.584 --> 12:24.350
(humming tune)

12:27.317 --> 12:28.984
Look at them barleyjacks,

12:29.051 --> 12:31.851
celebrating another one
of their stupid holidays.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.817
Hey, I ain't got no
problem with them.

12:33.884 --> 12:35.751
They pay in cash,
they keep it clean,

12:35.817 --> 12:38.051
and their mythology is
rich and enchanting.

12:38.118 --> 12:41.118
Yeah, and the redhead one
said today's the day
Woden gave the herring

12:41.183 --> 12:43.951
the greatest gift of all--
its fishy taste.

12:44.018 --> 12:46.350
Hey, Moe, what is that
hoity-toity beer
they're drinking?

12:46.417 --> 12:47.884
Oh, I don't sell
beer no more.

12:47.951 --> 12:49.584
I only serve Aquavit,

12:49.651 --> 12:51.851
the Norwegian caraway-scented
liqueur.

12:51.917 --> 12:54.350
Wait a minute-- you're
selling barleyjack booze?

12:54.417 --> 12:55.784
How could you, Moe?!

12:55.851 --> 12:57.917
Hey, it's all about
the King Haralds.

13:01.651 --> 13:04.283
Well, since it's all you've got,

13:04.350 --> 13:06.183
give me a mug of that
Aquavit stuff.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.183
Better go slow
there, friend.

13:08.250 --> 13:11.084
That stuff will open up a can
of "oh my goodness" on you.

13:11.150 --> 13:12.851
I think I can handle it.

13:16.617 --> 13:19.751
(drunkenly):
Hey, where'd that Homer guy go?

13:21.784 --> 13:23.717
(muffled):
More Aquavit, please.

13:25.484 --> 13:27.283
(groans)

13:27.350 --> 13:29.283
(drunkenly):
Farfegnugen...

13:29.350 --> 13:30.717
You're late.
And drunk.

13:30.784 --> 13:31.751
Shut up.

13:31.817 --> 13:33.851
You lost your job?

13:33.917 --> 13:35.283
It's not my fault.

13:35.350 --> 13:37.684
Those Ogdenville guys plied me

13:37.751 --> 13:39.617
with their native liqueurs
and liquors.

13:39.684 --> 13:41.484
But mostly liqueurs.

13:41.550 --> 13:43.484
Oh, poor Homie.

13:43.550 --> 13:45.984
And you with
your alcoholism.

13:46.051 --> 13:46.817
Yeah.

13:49.751 --> 13:51.951
I propose that no
Ogdenvillian be allowed

13:52.018 --> 13:53.784
within the city limits
of Springfield.

13:53.851 --> 13:56.051
I share your xylophobia.

13:56.118 --> 13:57.751
Dad, you mean
xenophobia.

13:57.817 --> 14:00.217
Xylophobia would be
a fear of xylophones.

14:00.283 --> 14:02.217
I am afraid of xylophones.

14:02.283 --> 14:04.951
It's the music you hear
when skeletons are dancing.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.350
Very well.

14:06.417 --> 14:09.517
Springfield will ban
immigrants and xylophones.

14:09.584 --> 14:11.317
All in favor, say "Aye."

14:11.384 --> 14:12.217
ALL:
Aye!

14:12.283 --> 14:14.851
The border is now closed.

14:14.917 --> 14:18.217
You'll never take my xylophone.

14:18.283 --> 14:20.851
Notes don't fail me now.

14:20.917 --> 14:22.417
(playing rapidly)

14:25.118 --> 14:26.851
There's one, Chief.

14:26.917 --> 14:28.350
Well, he's too far, Lou.

14:28.417 --> 14:29.450
That's not fair.

14:29.517 --> 14:30.550
There's another.

14:30.617 --> 14:31.984
He's on a bike, Lou.

14:32.051 --> 14:33.183
So?

14:33.250 --> 14:34.651
So what am I, Superman?

14:34.717 --> 14:36.584
Well, there's one coming
between your legs.

14:36.651 --> 14:38.084
Where?
There! Now!

14:38.150 --> 14:39.717
Right now, look
between your legs!

14:39.784 --> 14:41.384
I don't-- Oh, oh yeah.

14:41.450 --> 14:43.784
Oh, ow, ow...
No, he's too fast.

14:43.851 --> 14:44.951
It's hopeless, Lou.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.817
We can't handle this.

14:46.884 --> 14:48.484
We need help
patrolling the border.

14:48.550 --> 14:50.450
I mean, Springfield
only has three cops.

14:50.517 --> 14:52.517
Yeah. And Eddie's laid up
'cause of his gout.

14:52.584 --> 14:55.550
(groans)

14:55.617 --> 14:58.984
Yep. Eddie loves his
lobster and port wine,

14:59.051 --> 15:00.450
but it comes with a price.

15:00.517 --> 15:04.118
Excuse me: do you have to pay
to get in, or...?

15:04.183 --> 15:06.450
No, no, no, it's
free, it's free.

15:06.517 --> 15:08.984
Maybe we can ask private
citizens to guard the border.

15:09.051 --> 15:11.283
Yeah, you know, vigilantes
who would agree to do our job

15:11.350 --> 15:12.717
for the adrenaline rush

15:12.784 --> 15:14.917
that comes from having
a tiny taste of authority

15:14.984 --> 15:16.183
over your fellow man.

15:20.817 --> 15:23.651
And all we're paying 'em
is bullets and beer.

15:31.150 --> 15:32.851
(chuckles)

15:32.917 --> 15:35.084
I almost made a big mistake.

15:43.717 --> 15:46.451
Men, our negative energy
has been harnessed

15:46.518 --> 15:49.117
to help keep Springfield's
borders secure

15:49.184 --> 15:50.417
from Ogdenvillians.

15:50.484 --> 15:52.551
But first, our group
needs a name

15:52.618 --> 15:55.017
that evokes America's proud
history of citizens rising up

15:55.084 --> 15:56.551
to defend our way of life.

15:56.618 --> 15:57.984
The Klan?

15:58.050 --> 16:00.884
Well, there are no bad ideas,
but let's keep trying.

16:00.950 --> 16:01.884
The Nazis?

16:01.950 --> 16:03.783
Okay, you stop trying.

16:03.850 --> 16:06.151
Hey, how about the Star-Spangled
Goofballs?

16:06.217 --> 16:08.151
Mm! Goofballs it is!

16:08.217 --> 16:09.817
I'll float above the border,

16:09.884 --> 16:11.950
and radio the location
of illegals down to you.

16:12.017 --> 16:14.084
My code name will be
"Screaming Eagle."

16:14.151 --> 16:16.184
Yours will be "Ground Losers."

16:16.251 --> 16:18.184
What a fun day.
This is gonna
be good.

16:18.251 --> 16:20.084
Release the sandbags.

16:22.650 --> 16:24.650
Hey, why don't you
let Carl and me try?

16:24.717 --> 16:26.783
Okay, you guys get
in as I get off.

16:29.351 --> 16:30.417
(yelling)

16:30.484 --> 16:31.518
This is Ground Loser.

16:31.584 --> 16:32.750
What's your position?

16:32.817 --> 16:33.850
Over.

16:33.917 --> 16:36.251
C-c-cold.

16:36.317 --> 16:37.551
S-s-so very cold.

16:41.584 --> 16:44.217
I'm sorry to say that this
poorly-conceived patrol

16:44.284 --> 16:46.317
carried out by a group
of rank amateurs

16:46.384 --> 16:47.783
has somehow been a failure.

16:47.850 --> 16:50.317
Those barleyjacks are crafty.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.451
One of 'em handcuffed me
to this tree.

16:52.518 --> 16:53.750
That's not a
tree, Chief.

16:53.817 --> 16:55.084
That's a street sign.

16:55.151 --> 16:56.584
You just looped
your belt around it

16:56.650 --> 16:57.950
when you were
changing your pants.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.783
Okay, I'm hearing lots of
problems, but no solutions.

17:00.850 --> 17:03.850
This immigration problem is
bigger than we thought.

17:03.917 --> 17:06.717
We need a way to keep these
people out of our community.

17:06.782 --> 17:09.518
What can we do to keep
one group of people

17:09.584 --> 17:11.284
away from another
group of people?

17:14.782 --> 17:15.916
HOMER:
Why you little...!

17:15.983 --> 17:16.983
I'll kill you!

17:19.017 --> 17:22.151
That's it--
we'll build a fence.

17:22.217 --> 17:24.683
CROWD (chanting):
Fence! Fence! Fence! Fence!

17:26.217 --> 17:28.850
Homie, I don't think we
should build a fence.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.384
Haven't we always taught
the children to make friends

17:31.451 --> 17:33.384
with those who are
a little different?

17:33.451 --> 17:34.518
Yes.
Yeah.

17:34.584 --> 17:36.817
<i>Ja!
(gasps)</i>

17:36.884 --> 17:38.117
<i>Ja, ja!</i>

17:38.184 --> 17:41.650
Maggie's first words
are in Ogdenvillese!

17:41.717 --> 17:43.284
Now do you see, Marge?

17:43.351 --> 17:45.551
Now do you see why we
must build that fence?

17:45.618 --> 17:47.317
Build it, Homie!

17:47.384 --> 17:49.984
Make it as tall as the sky
and deeper than Hell.

17:49.985 --> 17:50.985
Ja. Ja.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.267
All right, who here knows
how to build a wall?

17:56.334 --> 17:58.534
I know how to hire guys
to build a wall.

17:58.601 --> 17:59.434
Such as?

17:59.501 --> 18:00.534
The Barleyjacks?

18:00.601 --> 18:02.134
(all agreeing)

18:02.200 --> 18:04.534
Okay, they can help,
us build the wall,

18:04.601 --> 18:06.167
because they're good at it.

18:06.234 --> 18:08.067
But then, those
good-for-nothings have to go.

18:08.134 --> 18:09.267
(cheering)

18:09.334 --> 18:10.734
Yeah, get 'em
out of here!

18:10.800 --> 18:13.501
(Benny Goodman's
"Sing, Sing, Sing" playing)

18:21.100 --> 18:23.833
So my girlfriend puts all
these pillows on the bed.

18:23.900 --> 18:26.267
And you have to like take
them all off at night

18:26.334 --> 18:28.634
and put them all back
on every morning.

18:28.701 --> 18:30.967
And if the little one is
in back of the big one,

18:31.034 --> 18:32.734
oh, God help you.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.267
<i>Ja, and they always want the
cat to sleep in bed with you.</i>

18:36.867 --> 18:37.967
Exactly.

18:40.067 --> 18:42.567
I had trouble finding a
four-button cardigan,

18:42.634 --> 18:43.933
so I bought
a three-button one

18:44.000 --> 18:45.634
and sewed the extra
button on myself.

18:45.701 --> 18:47.234
Hm! This baby was
a five-buttoner,

18:47.301 --> 18:49.601
but I took a button off.

18:49.668 --> 18:51.567
Maybe we're not so
different, Sven.

18:51.634 --> 18:52.701
<i>Ja, maybe so.</i>

18:55.134 --> 18:58.701
You know, if you put
down an acrylic primer,

18:58.768 --> 19:02.367
your satiric drawing
and its clever stink
lines will be there

19:02.434 --> 19:04.000
long after your
principal is gone.

19:04.067 --> 19:06.200
The guy at the store
said it didn't matter,

19:06.267 --> 19:07.701
but I knew he was wrong.

19:07.768 --> 19:08.567
Thanks, man.

19:08.634 --> 19:13.067
(all shouting)

19:18.234 --> 19:19.867
(clang echoing)

19:25.434 --> 19:28.567
(wind whistling)

19:28.634 --> 19:31.601
(Ralph giggling)

19:33.800 --> 19:35.668
Sure is quiet around here.

19:37.100 --> 19:37.967
Do ya miss us?

19:38.034 --> 19:39.200
<i>Ja, we miss you.</i>

19:39.267 --> 19:40.634
That's why we build
the door.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.800
Oh, we did miss you.

19:42.867 --> 19:45.567
We missed your kindness,
your hard work,

19:45.634 --> 19:48.234
your sweet plainspoken ways.

19:48.301 --> 19:49.467
What are you barleyjacks
waiting for?

19:49.534 --> 19:51.067
Get in here!

19:51.134 --> 19:53.768
We'd be more than pleased
to join you donut-dunkers.

19:53.833 --> 19:56.067
(lively chatter
and laughter)

19:58.701 --> 20:01.601
(siren wailing)

20:04.434 --> 20:07.867
All right, boys,
round 'em up...

20:07.933 --> 20:11.034
and throw them the swingingest
soiree they've ever seen!

20:13.501 --> 20:18.167
(lively Scandanavian
folk music playing)
