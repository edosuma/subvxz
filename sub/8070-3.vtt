[laughter]

[music playing]

00:58.192 --> 00:59.059
Wow.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.494
What a brutal play!

01:00.594 --> 01:02.130
I can't believe that
little Venezuelan guy's

01:02.230 --> 01:03.564
still standing.

01:03.664 --> 01:06.033
ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
Another left by Perez.

01:06.134 --> 01:07.368
Oh, he's down,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:07.468 --> 01:11.472
Arturo Guadalupe is down!

01:11.572 --> 01:13.407
Get up, you wimp.

01:13.507 --> 01:14.408
You're not even bleeding yet.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.376
Geez.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.277
Cheer up, Darling.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.512
Maybe he's dead.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.782
It's over, bag
him and tag him.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.384
Mom, will you help
me with my hair?

01:23.484 --> 01:24.318
What's wrong with it?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.319
I hate it.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.355
It just lays there
and does nothing.

01:27.455 --> 01:31.492
Trying to look all
grown up for Robert?

01:31.592 --> 01:32.660
Get human.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.995
I hear he does the
nasty with college girls.

01:35.095 --> 01:39.700
Well, I certainly hope he
gets extra credit for that.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.102
He just dated some senior
who takes some college

01:42.203 --> 01:43.937
classes, no a big deal.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.673
No, of course not.

01:45.773 --> 01:49.143
What do you think,
Dan, pigtails, ribbons?

01:49.243 --> 01:50.278
Works for me.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.179
Just forget it.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.714
I'll do it myself.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.683
Good luck covering up those
fresh zits tonight, princess.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.821
You're just jealous because
I'm anatomically correct.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.660
Yeah, and I bet you just
can't wait to show Robert.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.262
You're such a virgin.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.064
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.301
You tell him, Dan.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.335
She's pathetic.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.437
I mean, she's never
even been kissed.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.206
Right, like I don't have
enough spit at my own.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.611
Well, you've been
a lovely couple.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.979
Thanks for playing our game.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.782
You'll die without ever
getting to first base.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.318
Oh, go suck a tongue.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.253
Darlene, go do the dishes.

02:32.353 --> 02:36.690
Becky, go upstairs
and shave something.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.591
And you.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.897
You know they won't
always be this cute.

02:43.997 --> 02:44.832
Yeah, I know.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.700
I hear once they
hit 30, they start

02:46.800 --> 02:50.471
developing their own little
personalities and stuff.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.106
Have you talked to
Becky about birth control?

02:53.207 --> 02:56.644
Yeah, I sat her down
and I said Becky, don't.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.078
Rosanne.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.313
She doesn't need to hear it.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.948
She's never going to get
undressed in front of a guy.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.350
She thinks her butt's too big.

03:03.884 --> 03:07.855
I've been thinking, maybe
you should talk to her.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.357
Maybe you should talk to her.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.631
Well, good point, my pet.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.700
All right, so maybe I'll
have the talk with her.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.536
Don't make it sound like we're
told to go out and have sex.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.705
She doesn't need
our permission, Dan.

03:24.805 --> 03:29.777
Yeah, tell or never, never
trust guys, because we lie,

03:29.877 --> 03:32.413
big time.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.848
I had this buddy once, very
successful with the ladies.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.617
He used to tell him they
wouldn't get pregnant if they

03:36.717 --> 03:39.953
jumped up and down afterwards.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.088
Yeah, Phil D'Angelo.

03:44.892 --> 03:48.161
How did you know about that?

03:48.262 --> 03:53.066
You know, I believe I will
have that talk with Becky.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.435
I told you about that, right?

03:54.535 --> 03:56.770
Fine, fine.

03:56.870 --> 04:03.677
[music playing]

04:03.777 --> 04:06.179
And a niner for Brian.

04:06.280 --> 04:10.017
And a seven for Chicago Skinny
and his faithful sidekick,

04:10.117 --> 04:12.320
Shrimpo.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.622
Hey, I ain't a shrimpo.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.290
She's just trying
to rile us, boy.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.258
These dealers is wily.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.159
Hey.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.061
Hit me.

04:21.161 --> 04:21.962
Right, 21 on the nose.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.764
No fair.
He can add.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.201
What are you
yahoos going to do?

04:28.302 --> 04:29.303
Hit me.

04:29.403 --> 04:32.072
DJ, we've got 17.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.375
You never hit 17,
especially when

04:34.475 --> 04:35.509
you're betting five pretzels.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.011
Understand?

04:38.111 --> 04:38.912
Yeah.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.881
Hit me.

04:40.981 --> 04:41.882
Ten and flush.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.517
Too bad, suckers.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.919
There's a town out in the
desert with very bright lights

04:46.019 --> 04:46.820
waiting for you, boy.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.092
Too bad Mom's making you go
to the movies tonight, Dad.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.561
Yeah, the Bulls game
is going to be great.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.662
You should stick around.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.029
Yep.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.631
I'd love to watch the game,
but Deborah Winger is coughing

04:57.731 --> 05:00.501
up along at the cineplex.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.336
In Dolby.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.270
Jeez.

05:03.371 --> 05:04.505
How come we can
never do anything

05:04.605 --> 05:05.839
fun with Gary and Jackie?

05:05.939 --> 05:06.740
Because their family.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.978
You talked to
Becky about the--

05:11.078 --> 05:12.413
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.986
Wow, you look incredible.

05:19.086 --> 05:19.953
Really?

05:20.053 --> 05:22.456
Yes.
get in the kitchen.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.469
What do you know
about birth control?

05:35.569 --> 05:36.370
Nothing.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.171
I swear, really.

05:38.271 --> 05:42.510
No, this is going to be
like that talk, right?

05:42.610 --> 05:46.246
Here.s It's easier squirm
if you're sitting down.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.015
Mom, I'm not sleeping
with anyone, if that's

05:48.115 --> 05:48.982
what you're worried about.

05:49.082 --> 05:52.586
Oh, I know that, Becky.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.822
Would you be willing to
swear on a Bible, you know,

05:54.922 --> 05:57.257
just to make it official?

05:57.357 --> 06:01.228
Mom, I know all
about birth control.

06:01.328 --> 06:04.432
So then you know about not
getting pregnant by jumping

06:04.532 --> 06:05.699
up and down afterwards?

06:09.603 --> 06:11.639
Hey, Brian, what you say we
go out and shoot some hoops

06:11.739 --> 06:13.306
until the game starts.

06:13.407 --> 06:14.775
Can I come?

06:14.875 --> 06:17.144
No.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.413
OK.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.347
Hey, Gary.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.615
Hey, Dan.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.984
So Jacks, you and Rosie
pick out another female movie

06:24.084 --> 06:25.085
to torture us with tonight?

06:25.185 --> 06:26.687
Ah, what's wrong, Dan?

06:26.787 --> 06:30.958
Can't handle a little
emotion and sensitivity?

06:31.058 --> 06:33.894
Oh, yeah, right?

06:33.994 --> 06:36.229
I love you, but I'm dying.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.098
Oh, no.

06:38.198 --> 06:41.068
You can't die,
because I'm dying.

06:41.168 --> 06:41.969
Really?

06:42.069 --> 06:42.903
What's killing you?

06:43.003 --> 06:45.272
A woman's disease.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.173
Yeah.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.074
Me too.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.780
Yeah, like they'd really
have the same disease.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.317
Where's Roseanne?

06:57.417 --> 07:00.888
Kitchen, giving Becky the
zero population growth speech.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.389
Really?

07:02.490 --> 07:04.024
well, maybe she
could use some help.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.759
I mean, I don't want to
brag, but when it comes

07:05.859 --> 07:07.427
to birth control, I've tried--

07:11.098 --> 07:13.333
--to read just about
every book on the subject.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.070
Hi.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.906
Hi, Jackie.

07:19.006 --> 07:19.807
Beat it.

07:19.907 --> 07:20.941
We're talking.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.142
Oh.

07:22.242 --> 07:25.813
Oh, well, I'm just going
to get a glass of water.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.347
You mean I actually
have to go in the store

07:27.447 --> 07:29.149
and buy condoms myself?

07:29.249 --> 07:30.383
God, how embarrassing.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.319
Well, you don't have to
go in there and buy them.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.254
I mean, you could use
the rhythm method.

07:34.354 --> 07:35.155
How

07:35.255 --> 07:36.590
Does it work?

07:36.690 --> 07:37.491
Ask your brother.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.136
Thirsty.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.340
So what about the sponge?

07:53.440 --> 07:56.376
Is that pretty much foolproof?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.579
Well, you know I don't
have any statistics

07:58.679 --> 07:59.847
on all this kind of stuff.

08:03.951 --> 08:07.788
But then why not hear
it from an expert?

08:07.888 --> 08:10.057
You're on, Professor Jackie.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.659
Well, if you're sure.

08:11.759 --> 08:12.893
I'm not.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.963
All right, now although
some of your sponges

08:16.063 --> 08:20.534
can help prevent some disease,
they're only about 80%

08:20.634 --> 08:22.570
effective against pregnancy.

08:22.670 --> 08:28.208
So better still is your
condom sponge combo.

08:28.308 --> 08:32.012
Used correctly, we're
talking Fort Knox security

08:32.112 --> 08:35.248
at a price you can afford.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.149
I'm telling mom.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.922
But doesn't all that
stuff like kill the mood?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.391
Not as much as a screaming
baby with a loaded diaper.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.500
Oh, that's Robert.

08:53.601 --> 08:54.467
we're through, right?

08:54.568 --> 08:55.569
Well, you tell me.

08:55.669 --> 08:56.536
I got it, Mom.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.438
But I'm still going
to do anything.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.808
Well, now that's
100% effective.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.046
Yeah.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.916
Well, Mom could never talk
to us about birth control.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.751
She couldn't even
talk about sex.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.019
Sex.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.187
she told me it was something
people did in Europe.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.092
Well, no, she did try
and talk about it once,

09:19.192 --> 09:19.993
though, remember?

09:20.093 --> 09:21.629
But it was so lame.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.131
She said if we let a
boy go all the way,

09:24.231 --> 09:27.735
then we would be called
loose or slutty or trampy.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.169
Like that was going to stop us.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.674
She should have told
us we'd be called, mommy.

09:40.814 --> 09:41.915
Oh, give us a break.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.416
It's probably the first
time Jordan's missed

09:43.516 --> 09:44.852
three in a row his whole life.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.620
Yeah, I don't think he
snapped his wrist, you know.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.355
Looks like he's
pushing the ball.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.823
Yeah, he should
be popping it more.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.158
Yeah, so he gets
more backspin.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.059
Right.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.527
Time out Bulls, finally.

09:54.628 --> 09:58.065
Oh, great. here come
the bimbo cheerleaders.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.200
Maybe he's not getting
enough arc on the ball.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.369
I mean what if he
bent his knees more?

10:02.469 --> 10:03.536
What do you think, Brian?

10:03.637 --> 10:04.437
Brian?

10:04.537 --> 10:05.338
Yo, Brian.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.674
Huh?

10:06.774 --> 10:09.176
You actually like watching
those dancing Potato Heads.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.344
Oh, I don't know.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.046
Oh, wow, they're
all doing splits.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.085
Did I say potato heads?

10:18.185 --> 10:18.986
I was wrong.

10:19.086 --> 10:22.155
I must have meant geniuses.

10:22.255 --> 10:25.092
So what about the
cheerleaders at school?

10:25.192 --> 10:26.226
What about them?

10:26.326 --> 10:27.127
I don't know.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.829
You think they're pretty?

10:28.929 --> 10:30.764
Yeah, some of them.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.767
You won't believe what Vicki
Womack said the other day.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.103
She told me I should try out
for cheerleader next year.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.004
Ha ha.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.439
Good one.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.675
Yeah, that's what I said.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.311
I'm not even close to
being pretty enough, right?

10:44.411 --> 10:47.280
Well, you're just not
the right type, what's all.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.883
Yeah, well, I think
cheerleaders are stupid.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.919
Yeah, me too.

10:52.019 --> 10:52.986
Hey, Brian.

10:53.086 --> 10:53.887
What?

10:57.357 --> 10:59.026
What was that for.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.594
For thinking
cheerleaders are stupid.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.431
Oh, well I don't
think they're stupid.

11:04.531 --> 11:07.367
I think they're complete idiots.

11:07.467 --> 11:11.839
[music playing]

11:11.939 --> 11:20.781
[music playing]

11:20.881 --> 11:22.415
Becky's in the
front room with a boy.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.089
Becky!

11:36.496 --> 11:38.231
Darlene?

11:38.331 --> 11:39.132
Hi, Mommy.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.638
Uh, we'd better go.

11:45.739 --> 11:48.608
Are you out of your mind?

11:48.708 --> 11:49.777
Hey, sports fans.

11:49.877 --> 11:50.677
How was the game?

11:53.747 --> 11:58.385
Yeah, I would like to
hear the final score.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.754
Bulls lost, I think.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.856
You guys been wrestling?

12:02.956 --> 12:03.757
What'd she do, Brian?

12:03.857 --> 12:04.858
Pin you down a couple of time?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.296
Brian, it's been fun
watching the game with you,

12:09.396 --> 12:11.098
but I think it's time
for you to go home now.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.368
Hi, Darlene.

12:15.468 --> 12:19.039
See you at school tomorrow.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.573
OK.

12:20.673 --> 12:21.474
Hey.

12:24.644 --> 12:25.445
come back soon, buddy.

12:29.817 --> 12:30.650
I'll be in my room.

12:30.750 --> 12:31.551
Night, kiddo.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.459
What?

12:39.559 --> 12:40.994
Dan, they were making out.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.004
Did you notice how
her blouse was all?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.340
Yeah, like it hadn't been
on her back the whole night.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.150
That's great.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.051
That's just great.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.356
Where are you going?

13:09.456 --> 13:13.626
I want to make sure little
Brian gets home all right.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.228
Yeah, some big
guy in a truck might

13:15.328 --> 13:17.364
accidentally plow him over.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.265
What?

13:18.365 --> 13:21.168
Did you forget your shotgun?

13:21.268 --> 13:23.736
Dan, yelling at that girl
is not going to solve a thing.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.173
I just want to explain that
when she's under this roof,

13:26.273 --> 13:28.408
she's not to touch boys.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.110
If you do that,
you will guarantee

13:30.210 --> 13:33.246
she has a family of four by the
time she graduates high school.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.147
Yeah?

13:34.247 --> 13:35.048
Go to your room.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.187
You know, it's really
not all that bad.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.254
Not now, Jackie.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.655
All right?

13:42.755 --> 13:45.125
No, I bet I was her age when
Doug Brock got to second base

13:45.225 --> 13:46.259
with me.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.496
It was during a football
game, ironically enough.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.999
And we were sitting under a
big blanket in the end zone.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.033
Honey.
Honey!

13:53.133 --> 13:54.734
Buy me a cup of coffee?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.169
I'm helping, Gary.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.608
I'll be at home if
you need me, Roseanne.

14:01.708 --> 14:02.609
Take it easy, Dan.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.510
Yeah.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.682
Roseanne, Darlene
is 14 years old.

14:09.782 --> 14:13.620
Well, Becky was 14
when she started dating.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.388
Becky is not Darlene.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.124
Right. she's not
stupid enough to get

14:17.224 --> 14:19.792
caught groping on
her parents' couch.

14:19.893 --> 14:20.994
That's not what
I'm talking about.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.629
Darlene is different.
She plays sports.

14:22.729 --> 14:23.830
She's tough.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.198
Well, she's got a new sport.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.138
You know, you're just all
upset about this because of you

14:31.238 --> 14:32.906
and Darlene being so close.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.207
I'm close with Becky, too.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.909
Well, you never got
this upset about Becky

14:36.009 --> 14:36.944
doing the same thing.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.278
Becky's older.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.014
No, it's about the
fact that ya'll sit here

14:41.114 --> 14:42.916
and watch games on TV together.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.817
And you work in
the yard together.

14:44.918 --> 14:48.355
And then you shoot hoopies
out in the driveway.

14:50.823 --> 14:51.624
Hoopies.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.630
I mean, I'm not, you know,
excited about it, either.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.366
But it's not like
the end of the world.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.935
I mean, face it, honey.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.603
Your son is becoming a woman.

15:06.639 --> 15:07.440
Hi.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.441
Hi.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.310
- How did it go?
- Great.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.179
I'm going to go upstairs
and jump up and down now.

15:20.053 --> 15:20.920
Goodnight, Becky.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.227
Oh, it's just you.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.128
Huh, sorry.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.532
So how was your date?

15:32.632 --> 15:34.767
Oh, he's a great kisser.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.869
But it's not like you
would know the difference.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.072
Did you get felt up?

15:39.172 --> 15:40.073
No.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.108
Ha, I did.

15:48.681 --> 15:49.949
I don't believe you.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.584
It's true me and
Brian made out tonight.

15:51.684 --> 15:52.752
And he went up my shirt.

15:52.852 --> 15:53.686
What?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.322
But you guys never
even went out.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.857
So? we play basketball
almost every day.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.393
Well, it's not the
same thing, Darlene.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.195
Anyway, how do you know he's
not going to go to school

16:02.295 --> 16:03.630
Monday and tell everybody?

16:03.730 --> 16:06.566
I told him I'd
punch his face in.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.702
That could work.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.471
Mom and Dad sort of caught us.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.506
Oh, God, did they freak?

16:13.606 --> 16:15.742
Not yet.

16:15.842 --> 16:18.178
So how was it?

16:18.278 --> 16:20.313
The kissing is
pretty good, I guess.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.383
Well, what about
the other stuff?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.685
Better than volleyball,
and yet not quite as good as

16:25.785 --> 16:28.488
hockey.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.790
Look, Darlene, you
can't be doing this, OK?

16:30.890 --> 16:33.026
You got to make guys
treat you a certain way.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.128
You got to call the shots.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.130
Make them beg, right?

16:37.230 --> 16:40.167
Basically.

16:40.267 --> 16:43.603
My dainty daughters.

16:43.703 --> 16:47.240
Oh, I am so proud
of both of you.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.675
How long have you been spying?

16:48.775 --> 16:49.576
15 years.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.911
I'm getting good at it, huh?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.046
So is it official?

16:53.146 --> 16:54.581
Am I grounded forever?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.149
Why, no, you're not grounded.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.618
We're throwing a special
debutante party to celebrate

16:58.718 --> 17:00.120
this special moment.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.589
Your dad's on the phone
right now hiring the band.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.490
Oh, great.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.857
Torture me, then ground me.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.763
No, no.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.799
I want you to tell me
all about it, lover girl.

17:14.901 --> 17:15.702
No, wait.

17:15.802 --> 17:16.869
I have a better idea.

17:16.969 --> 17:17.870
Don't tell me.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.539
And then I'll be
really, really surprised

17:19.639 --> 17:20.673
when I read it in your diary.

17:23.810 --> 17:24.844
You're hysterical.

17:28.548 --> 17:32.051
So you really go for
this dating stuff, huh?

17:32.152 --> 17:32.985
Who was dating?

17:33.086 --> 17:34.187
I wanted to see
what it was like.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.355
So I kissed him.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.357
And I didn't have to
drown my face and mascara,

17:37.457 --> 17:41.194
like some Barbie dolls
who shall remain nameless.

17:41.294 --> 17:44.197
So I guess you really
showed Becky, huh?

17:44.297 --> 17:45.598
Well, it's not why I did it.

17:45.698 --> 17:46.566
I mean, at first, maybe.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.936
But then that was different.

17:50.036 --> 17:53.940
And then maybe things
went a little too far?

17:54.040 --> 17:55.808
Maybe.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.411
you think he'll ever
talk to me again?

17:58.511 --> 18:02.715
Well, you did use him
like a cheap piece of meat.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.050
Guys love that.

18:06.819 --> 18:07.920
Oh, and what about
you and Robert?

18:08.020 --> 18:09.789
Any wedding plans I
should know about?

18:09.889 --> 18:11.358
You know, while your
father still has

18:11.458 --> 18:13.326
the band on the phone and all.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.428
Oh, right, like I'm going
to let him pick the music.

18:20.032 --> 18:23.069
Listen, Girls.

18:29.542 --> 18:40.086
Sex is something that is
not even going to be good

18:40.187 --> 18:42.755
until, you know, you're older.

18:42.855 --> 18:43.890
Mother.

18:43.990 --> 18:44.891
No, no.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.794
We've never really
talked about sex.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.497
And I think we should
have that discussion now.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.099
- All right, go ahead.
- Well, OK.

18:56.769 --> 19:00.307
Well, if you were to
like you know, do it now,

19:00.407 --> 19:02.141
I mean, sure, you'd
have some pleasure.

19:02.242 --> 19:09.849
But it would be like a lot
better, you know, if you were--

19:09.949 --> 19:11.518
What you're trying to
say is that we're far

19:11.618 --> 19:12.719
too young to go all the way.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.621
Well, both your
body and your mind

19:14.721 --> 19:16.756
have to reach a certain
sort of maturity.

19:16.856 --> 19:17.657
Yeah.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.559
And you don't regret it later.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.694
And hey, you have
to love the guy.

19:21.794 --> 19:22.829
Yeah.

19:22.929 --> 19:26.233
And you know, you would
like to make sure that--

19:26.333 --> 19:27.467
That you respect him.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.935
- Or it's meaningless.
- Or, you know, or that he--

19:29.035 --> 19:29.836
And that he respects you.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.137
He respects you, right.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.474
Beautiful, beautiful thing.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.942
Right.

19:36.042 --> 19:39.145
Well, then.

19:39.246 --> 19:44.684
Well, I guess I feel really
good about our little chat here.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.185
You guys feel good about it?

19:46.286 --> 19:47.254
Oh, absolutely.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.989
Definitely, definitely.

19:50.089 --> 19:50.890
Well.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.024
Well, that's great then.

19:52.124 --> 19:52.925
All right.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.694
That's great.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.429
OK, well, goodnight, girls.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.530
Goodnight, Mom.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.465
I love you, Mom.

19:58.565 --> 19:59.732
I love you.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.734
I love you too.

20:01.834 --> 20:02.635
Goodnight.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.771

Come on, try to get by me.

Let's go.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.669
Hey, my turn.

20:36.769 --> 20:40.006
Roseanne, I know
what this is about.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.173
And I don't need a pep talk.

20:41.274 --> 20:44.277
No, I want to shoot hoopies.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.845
Come on, let's see if
you can get behind me.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.046
Get around me.

20:47.146 --> 20:50.383
OK, give me the ball and
I'll inbound it to you.

20:50.483 --> 20:51.618
What's in bound?

20:51.718 --> 20:52.619
Another word for sucker.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.828
Did you tell Darlene about the--

21:01.928 --> 21:04.397
I told her to slow down.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.732
That all?

21:05.832 --> 21:08.868
Well, I told them that sex
wasn't even going to be that

21:08.968 --> 21:11.971
great till they were like 27.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.341
27?

21:14.441 --> 21:16.943
Well, maybe that's just me.

21:17.043 --> 21:17.944
Well, you were there for me.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.346
That's all that's important.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.816
Well, no matter
what I said to them,

21:23.916 --> 21:25.452
I mean that can't
compare to what they're

21:25.552 --> 21:27.387
up there saying to each other.

21:27.487 --> 21:31.624
Want to make some popcorn
and go up there and listen?

to hang out down here
