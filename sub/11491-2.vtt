<i>* Men. *</i>

00:03.033 --> 00:04.100
Hey, Danny.

00:04.100 --> 00:05.701
Did you say good morning
to Melissa?

00:05.701 --> 00:07.734
Good morning, Melissa.

00:07.734 --> 00:10.501
You look lovely today.

00:10.501 --> 00:12.334
Thank you, Danny

00:12.334 --> 00:13.934
I think he's got
a little thing for you.

00:13.934 --> 00:17.634
<i>No, you've got
a little thing for her.</i>

00:17.634 --> 00:23.467
I've got a croquet mallet
in my pants.

00:23.467 --> 00:26.834
Al, I thought I told you
to keep that doll in your room.

00:26.834 --> 00:28.033
Come on.

00:28.033 --> 00:30.167
He's got to feed
the broad sometime.

00:31.567 --> 00:32.601
See what I did there?

00:32.601 --> 00:34.534
You're so clever.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.901
How about spaghetti with pesto
for dinner tonight?

00:36.901 --> 00:39.167
Oh, boy, with the pine nut
You got it.

00:40.267 --> 00:43.667
I've got your pine nuts
right here.

00:43.667 --> 00:44.834
Danny.

00:44.834 --> 00:47.334
Buy one, get one free.

00:47.334 --> 00:51.267
Okay, Al, I'm only going
to ask you this once.

00:51.267 --> 00:53.868
Has litt Miss Muppet
moved into my house?

00:53.868 --> 00:55.367
What? No. Huh-uh.

00:55.367 --> 00:56.734
Really?

00:56.734 --> 00:58.801
Then explain why she's
here when I go to bed

00:58.801 --> 01:00.167
and still here
when get up.

01:00.167 --> 01:01.734
Well, to be fair, Charlie,

01:01.734 --> 01:03.300
you do have an erratic
sleep schedule.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.467
And that's not even
counting the drunken blackouts.

01:05.467 --> 01:08.567
So you're saying I continually
miss it when she goes home?

01:08.567 --> 01:11.067
Charlie, you missed Easter
last year.

01:11.067 --> 01:12.667
Was that the time I woke up

01:12.667 --> 01:16.000
with a Cadbury egg
melted in my short

01:17.834 --> 01:20.200
Sadly enough, no.

01:21.767 --> 01:23.801
Okay, okay,
just so you understand

01:23.801 --> 01:26.767
this is my house and you don't
get to invite people to move in.

01:26.767 --> 01:28.067
Why do you keep harping on that?

01:28.067 --> 01:29.467
She is not living here.

01:29.467 --> 01:31.300
I'm just going to throw
in a load of laundry

01:31.300 --> 01:32.567
before I go to work.

01:34.234 --> 01:37.033
Sure looks like she is.

01:38.701 --> 01:40.567
I don't know
what he's talking about.

02:12.167 --> 02:13.600
Hey, listen,
I was thinking.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.301
Why don't we bring my bed over
from my mother's house?

02:17.734 --> 02:19.001
We've already got a bed.

02:19.001 --> 02:21.267
This isn't a bed,
it's a fold-out couch.

02:21.267 --> 02:23.034
And you're the one who's always
complaining about it.

02:23.034 --> 02:25.468
Oh, I complain
about a lot of things.

02:25.468 --> 02:27.368
Like, uh, like automatic
flush toilets.

02:27.368 --> 02:29.201
I mean, everything's gone
before you get a chance

02:29.201 --> 02:32.067
to turn around
and check out how you did.

02:32.067 --> 02:33.867
What the dickens
are you talking about?

02:33.867 --> 02:35.767
Let's just leave the furniture
the way it is.

02:35.767 --> 02:36.834
I don't want to rock the boat.

02:36.834 --> 02:38.267
How is getting
a decent bed

02:38.267 --> 02:39.401
rocking the boat?

02:39.401 --> 02:42.201
This is our room, isn't it?
Well, yeah.

02:42.201 --> 02:44.101
And-and no. I mean...

02:44.101 --> 02:45.334
It's still Charlie's house.

02:45.334 --> 02:47.567
But you pay rent?
Of course.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.633
I mean, you know,
the actual number fluctuates

02:49.633 --> 02:52.134
depending on the economy
and whether Charlie's conscious

02:52.134 --> 02:53.967
on the first of the month.
But yeah, I pay.

02:53.967 --> 02:56.667
Okay, then you need to start
standing up to him.

02:56.667 --> 02:58.167
Oh, please.

02:58.167 --> 03:00.567
I stand up to him plenty.
Is that so?

03:04.401 --> 03:06.401
You think he likes
unsalted butter?

03:06.401 --> 03:07.700
He does not.

03:09.034 --> 03:11.034
Now you listen
to me, Alan Harper.

03:11.034 --> 03:13.767
You are a strong,
assertive man.

03:13.767 --> 03:16.134
I know that because I
couldn't be with you

03:16.134 --> 03:17.767
if you were anything less.

03:17.767 --> 03:19.734
Oh, well, yeah, I am.

03:19.734 --> 03:21.900
You know, I...
I don't want to flaunt

03:21.900 --> 03:27.734
my strong assertiveness by,
you know, asking for stuff.

03:27.734 --> 03:29.401
Alan, you need
to tell your brother

03:29.401 --> 03:31.301
we're moving my bed in here
and if he doesn't like it,

03:31.301 --> 03:33.600
well, then that is just
his tough noogies.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.401
Okay, I will tell him.

03:36.401 --> 03:40.334
Good.
But slowly.

03:40.334 --> 03:42.167
As I did with the butter.

03:42.167 --> 03:45.167
And how long did that take?

03:46.334 --> 03:47.700
That is not important.

03:47.700 --> 03:49.667
What's important is this is now

03:49.667 --> 03:51.700
a low sodium,
heart smart household.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.234
He thinks he's fooling me,
But he's not.

03:55.234 --> 03:56.967
She's living here.

03:56.967 --> 03:59.533
He moved her in
right under my nose.

03:59.533 --> 04:00.967
So?

04:00.967 --> 04:04.600
<i>So this is
the unsalted butter again,</i>

04:04.600 --> 04:07.667
but, you know, writ lae.

04:08.867 --> 04:11.067
What difference does it
make if she lives here?

04:11.067 --> 04:12.734
"What difference?"

04:12.734 --> 04:14.001
Are you kidding?

04:14.001 --> 04:15.667
First it's him
and his stinky kid

04:15.667 --> 04:18.867
and now he's shacking up
with Strawberry Shortcake!

04:18.867 --> 04:20.767
He pays rent,
doesn't he?

04:20.767 --> 04:22.301
I don't know.

04:22.301 --> 04:23.767
Once, maybe.

04:24.967 --> 04:26.434
He says he did.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.767
So why do you care
who he has in his room?

04:29.767 --> 04:32.134
I care because...

04:32.134 --> 04:33.533
There's a principle involved.

04:33.533 --> 04:34.567
"A principle"?

04:34.567 --> 04:36.900
Yes! I made a rule.

04:36.900 --> 04:40.667
Ooh, you made a rule.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.234
Yes, I made a rule.

04:42.234 --> 04:43.301
And I'm making another one.

04:43.301 --> 04:45.767
You do not get
to mock my rules.

04:45.767 --> 04:47.667
You're being silly, Charlie.

04:47.667 --> 04:49.234
Melissa is
a wonderful girl.

04:49.234 --> 04:51.567
They love each other
and she makes him happy.

04:51.567 --> 04:54.700
And I care about
that because...?

04:54.700 --> 04:57.468
Because the Charlie Harper
that I fell in love with

04:57.468 --> 04:59.867
cares about other
people's happiness.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.734
That's the Charlie Harper
you fell in love with, huh?
Yes.

05:02.734 --> 05:05.434
Well, joke's on you.

05:05.434 --> 05:07.334
That whole nice guy
thing was a big act

05:07.334 --> 05:09.334
to get you to have sex with me.

05:09.334 --> 05:11.001
Ha-ha.

05:11.001 --> 05:13.734
I know you'll do the
right thing, Charlie.

05:14.767 --> 05:16.434
Oh, you do, huh?

05:17.867 --> 05:21.101
Most of the time, I'm not even
sure what the right thing is.

05:22.001 --> 05:24.800
<i>* Men. *</i>

05:26.167 --> 05:27.867
Hey.

05:27.867 --> 05:29.167
Hey.
Got a minute?

05:29.167 --> 05:30.267
I'm reading.

05:30.267 --> 05:32.434
Okay, we'll talk later.

05:38.967 --> 05:40.600
Damn it, Alan, get back out there!

05:40.600 --> 05:43.334
But I got to pee.
You already peed, now go!

05:43.334 --> 05:45.633
(door opens and closes)

05:45.633 --> 05:47.967
Hey-ho.

05:47.967 --> 05:50.468
What do you want, Alan?
Well...

05:50.468 --> 05:53.700
as you know, I pay my fair share
of rent around here.

05:53.700 --> 05:57.201
We probably have different
definitions of "fair."

05:57.201 --> 05:59.533
And "share."

05:59.533 --> 06:01.700
And "rent," but go on.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.533
I-I-I just don't think
I need your permission

06:04.533 --> 06:06.301
when it comes to Melissa
living with me.

06:06.301 --> 06:08.800
Well, you're wrong.
Nice talking to you.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.900
Charlie.

06:09.900 --> 06:12.267
I would hope that...
Don't Charlie me.

06:12.267 --> 06:13.533
This is my house.

06:13.533 --> 06:15.101
Not yours, mine.

06:15.101 --> 06:16.934
And the fact is
if Melissa moves in,

06:16.934 --> 06:19.434
that means you've got more
people living here than I do.

06:19.434 --> 06:20.934
So?

06:20.934 --> 06:23.600
<i>So there's a principle
involved...</i>

06:27.767 --> 06:30.167
...that we must discuss.

06:30.167 --> 06:32.934
Okay, so what's
the principle?

06:38.334 --> 06:41.468
The principle is that...

06:41.468 --> 06:44.800
you're my brother
and I want you to be happy.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.001
So Melissa can stay?

06:49.001 --> 06:50.368
I mean, move in?

06:53.834 --> 06:55.800
Sure.

06:58.234 --> 06:59.667
Well, all right then.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.101
(exclaims)

07:09.401 --> 07:11.700
<i>* Men. *</i>

07:14.434 --> 07:15.767
You know,
I was thinking.

07:15.767 --> 07:18.134
You've got me.
Alan's got Melissa.

07:18.134 --> 07:20.101
Even Jake's got a girlfriend.

07:20.101 --> 07:22.800
We need to find somebody
for Sir Lancelot.

07:24.267 --> 07:26.600
Your cat?

07:26.600 --> 07:29.368
Yeah. Doesn't he deserve
some happiness?

07:29.368 --> 07:32.134
He can lick his own crotch.
What else does he need?

07:33.767 --> 07:35.001
Come on, Charlie.

07:35.001 --> 07:37.034
Why shouldn't he have
so companionship?

07:37.034 --> 07:39.034
All right.

07:39.034 --> 07:41.600
How about we get him
nice lady coyote?

07:42.468 --> 07:43.667
Charlie!

07:43.667 --> 07:45.967
What? It'd be good
for ol' Lance.

07:45.967 --> 07:48.101
Get a little exercise
running for his life.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.167
You're terrible.

07:50.167 --> 07:52.334
(phone ringing)

07:53.234 --> 07:54.667
Let the machine get it.

07:54.667 --> 07:56.067
Hi, this is Alan.

07:56.067 --> 07:57.533
And this is Melissa.

07:57.533 --> 07:59.767
We're not home right now
and neither are Charlie
and Chelsea.

07:59.767 --> 08:01.101
Well, Charlie might be
home, but he's probably

08:01.101 --> 08:02.600
in no condition to answer.

08:07.134 --> 08:09.201
Leave a message
when you hear the beep.

08:09.201 --> 08:11.867
Beep!

08:11.867 --> 08:13.434
(machine beeps)

08:13.434 --> 08:14.734
Hello, Charlie?

08:14.734 --> 08:15.900
It's your mother.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.167
Remember me?

08:17.167 --> 08:18.834
The woman who carried you
in her womb

08:18.834 --> 08:21.767
for roughly
seven and a half mons.

08:21.767 --> 08:24.134
Anyway, I'd say call me,
but what's the point?

08:24.134 --> 08:25.533
I've long since
given up expecting

08:25.533 --> 08:28.401
any kind of consideration...

08:28.401 --> 08:29.867
"Seven and a half months"?

08:29.867 --> 08:33.467
She always said,
"If God wanted us to lose our figures

08:33.467 --> 08:36.101
he wouldn't have invented
C-sections and incubators."

08:37.267 --> 08:38.368
Oh, hey, all.

08:38.368 --> 08:39.267
We're home.

08:39.267 --> 08:42.368
Oh, boy.
Hi.

08:42.368 --> 08:44.067
Charlie?

08:44.067 --> 08:45.867
Hi.

08:45.867 --> 08:47.401
Oh, uh, just so you know,

08:47.401 --> 08:49.800
Melissa and I are going to put our food
on the bottom shelf

08:49.800 --> 08:52.234
and you guys can take the top 
and we'll split the door, okay?

08:52.234 --> 08:53.533
That's a great idea.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.401
No, it's not.
It's my refrigerator.

08:55.401 --> 08:56.734
Be quiet.

08:56.734 --> 08:58.167
I bought it.
I paid for it.

08:58.167 --> 09:00.767
Charlie!
The whole thing, not just half.

09:00.767 --> 09:01.900
Stop being a child.

09:01.900 --> 09:03.533
I'm just saying.
I'm not going to forfeit

09:03.533 --> 09:06.234
a grape soda just because
I put it on the wrong shelf!

09:07.834 --> 09:09.700
Mind if we join you guys?
Sure.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.034
<i>What are we watching?</i>

09:11.034 --> 09:13.001
<i>An Odd couple rerun.</i>

09:13.001 --> 09:15.267
Oh, I never really
liked that show.

09:15.267 --> 09:17.667
Why not?
I don't really buy the premise.

09:17.667 --> 09:20.134
I mean, you know, who in his right mind
would put up with somebody

09:20.134 --> 09:22.567
who drives him crazy
for all those years?

09:28.934 --> 09:31.434
I mean, it would be
different if they were reled.

09:34.167 --> 09:36.468
<i>* Men. *</i>

09:37.401 --> 09:39.600
That was fun picking out
our wedding crystal.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.834
Oh, yeah.
Barrel of monkeys.

09:41.834 --> 09:44.134
I'm so excited
about that big punch bowl.

09:44.134 --> 09:46.001
You know what would be
really exciting?

09:46.001 --> 09:48.167
Next time you ask me to go
shopping with you,

09:48.167 --> 09:50.734
use it to cave in my skull.

09:55.267 --> 09:57.468
What the hell is this?

09:57.468 --> 09:59.201
Oh, look who's here.

09:59.201 --> 10:01.468
He dude, party down.

10:02.967 --> 10:05.201
What are you doing?

10:05.201 --> 10:06.734
We invited a few friends over.

10:06.734 --> 10:08.368
You don't have any friends.

10:08.368 --> 10:10.134
Yeah, but Melissa does.

10:10.134 --> 10:12.067
So now they're mine, too.

10:12.067 --> 10:13.934
They don't
really like you.

10:13.934 --> 10:15.301
They do, too.

10:15.301 --> 10:17.468
Dream on, meat puppet.

10:18.533 --> 10:20.267
Who said you could have a party?

10:20.267 --> 10:22.434
I'm sorry.
I thought we lived here.

10:22.434 --> 10:24.368
Must we check with you
about everything we do?

10:24.368 --> 10:26.767
Yes!

10:26.767 --> 10:29.267
What's that guy drinking?

10:29.267 --> 10:30.734
Is that my grape soda?

10:30.734 --> 10:32.468
It was on our shelf.

10:32.468 --> 10:33.867
What'd I tell ya?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.368
Okay, that's it.
Charlie...

10:37.368 --> 10:39.167
No-no-no. No, no, this is
not acceptable.

10:39.167 --> 10:41.167
Hey, everybody!

10:42.067 --> 10:43.800
Everybody listen up.

10:43.800 --> 10:44.900
(music stops)

10:44.900 --> 10:47.034
Party's over.

10:47.034 --> 10:50.167
Pack up your crap and get out.

10:54.167 --> 10:56.067
I'm not kidding!

10:57.067 --> 10:59.234
One.

11:01.001 --> 11:02.633
I'm counting to three,
by the way.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.001
Two.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.767
Ah, screw it.

11:08.767 --> 11:10.368
I'll leave.

11:10.368 --> 11:11.500
Charlie.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.101
Forget it.
I'm out of here.

11:14.101 --> 11:15.401
(crowd chatter)

11:15.401 --> 11:18.633
See what happens
when I do the right thing?

11:25.334 --> 11:27.634
Okay, I think you're
really overreacting,

11:27.634 --> 11:30.767
but if you want to spend
the night at a hotel, fine.

11:30.767 --> 11:35.001
No, I ll not come over there
for a quickie.

11:35.001 --> 11:37.500
Good-bye, Charlie.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.500
He just needs to cool off.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.834
We're really sorry, Chelsea.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.967
We probably should have talked
to you guys

11:42.967 --> 11:44.334
before inviting
our friends over.

11:44.334 --> 11:46.167
Your friends?

11:47.767 --> 11:49.901
Maybe we just need
some kind of system

11:49.901 --> 11:52.533
where we give each other
a heads up about guests.

11:52.533 --> 11:53.433
That's a great idea.

11:53.433 --> 11:55.134
Excuse me.

11:55.134 --> 11:57.800
Since when do you two call
the shots around here?

11:57.800 --> 11:59.500
What are you
talking about?

12:01.700 --> 12:04.901
All right, ladies,

12:04.901 --> 12:07.201
let's make something very clear.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.533
There is an established
pecking order in this house

12:10.533 --> 12:11.734
that needs to be honored.

12:11.734 --> 12:12.934
Oh, really?

12:12.934 --> 12:14.334
And what might that be?

12:14.334 --> 12:15.533
Wow.

12:15.533 --> 12:16.667
(laughs)

12:16.667 --> 12:18.500
Do I have to spell it out?

12:18.500 --> 12:20.067
Please do.

12:20.067 --> 12:22.201
Fine.

12:22.201 --> 12:26.101
When Charlie is not here,
I am in charge

12:32.867 --> 12:36.533
That's okay, isn't it?

12:38.034 --> 12:40.101
* Men.

12:45.368 --> 12:46.567
Yeah?

12:46.567 --> 12:57.301
Room service.

12:57.301 --> 13:00.067
Guess who got himself kicked out
of the house.

13:01.134 --> 13:02.467
Ow! Ow!

13:02.467 --> 13:04.734
Cut it out!
Cut it out!

13:06.234 --> 13:08.268
What are you
doing here, Alan?

13:08.268 --> 13:10.167
Honestly, I didn't have
any place else to go.

13:10.167 --> 13:12.500
Yeah, well, I got news
for you. You still don't.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.101
Oh, come on, Charlie.

13:14.101 --> 13:16.667
Alan, you're the reason
I'm here in the first place.

13:16.667 --> 13:19.201
I know, I know. I might have
crossed a bit of a line.

13:19.201 --> 13:22.101
A bit of a line?

13:22.101 --> 13:24.334
You moved your girlfriend into
my house without telling me.

13:24.334 --> 13:26.433
You invited strangers over
without my permission.

13:26.433 --> 13:28.667
And then, then, to add
insult to injury,

13:28.667 --> 13:31.634
you show up here with
your ugly friggin' dummy?!

13:31.634 --> 13:33.634
Did you hear that?

13:33.634 --> 13:35.834
He called you ugly.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.467
Good-bye, Alan.

13:39.467 --> 13:41.600
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.834
I...

13:42.834 --> 13:44.334
I brought a peace offering.

13:44.334 --> 13:46.700
That's my
ten-year-old Scotch!

13:46.700 --> 13:47.567
No, it's not.

13:47.567 --> 13:48.867
Yes, it is.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.500
I saw him take it.
Oh!

13:52.500 --> 13:55.234
Damn it, Danny,
what is wrong with you?

13:55.234 --> 13:56.767
What's wrong with me?

13:56.767 --> 13:59.967
You're the one with your hand
between my little wooden cheeks.

13:59.967 --> 14:02.800
All right, all right,
enough. Enough.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.034
I'm gonna
drink scotch,

14:05.034 --> 14:06.167
I'm gonna need ice.

14:06.167 --> 14:07.667
There's a machine down the hall.

14:07.667 --> 14:09.700
Be right back.

14:16.867 --> 14:19.201
Yeah, like I don't have ice.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.067
<i>* Men. *</i>

14:28.500 --> 14:31.567
Thanks for letting
me back in.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.767
You were crying
in the hallway.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.567
The other guests complned.

14:40.001 --> 14:41.734
Still, it's very
considerate of you.

14:41.734 --> 14:43.901
Shut up and drink my scotch.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.334
Cheers.

14:47.334 --> 14:49.500
Bite me.

14:51.834 --> 14:53.567
This is kind
of fun, though.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.400
You and me sharing a hotel room 
just like when we were kids.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.567
Swell.

14:59.567 --> 15:02.901
Remember that time Mom took us 
on that Caribbean cruise?

15:02.901 --> 15:04.034
We had our own cabin.

15:04.034 --> 15:05.934
Yeah.

15:05.934 --> 15:08.433
Took us three days to figure out
Mom was on another boat.

15:11.901 --> 15:13.901
Good times.
Mmm.

15:16.934 --> 15:18.533
We've lost our
house, Charlie.

15:23.234 --> 15:24.734
Your house.

15:24.734 --> 15:25.934
We've lost your house.

15:25.934 --> 15:28.433
I know.

15:28.433 --> 15:29.634
How did this happen?

15:29.634 --> 15:32.533
Slowly.

15:32.533 --> 15:34.867
In irements.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.600
Starting with the butter.

15:38.301 --> 15:39.867
I can see that now.

15:39.867 --> 15:42.234
The problem is, the women have
established a beachhead.

15:42.234 --> 15:43.368
(chuckling)

15:43.368 --> 15:45.301
What?

15:45.301 --> 15:46.967
Nothing. Nothing.

15:46.967 --> 15:52.234
You just reminded me why
I bought a house in Malibu.

15:52.234 --> 15:53.234
The thing is,

15:53.234 --> 15:55.800
if we go back,
we'll appear weak.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.634
I don't mind that.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.201
No, no, we need a plan.

16:00.201 --> 16:01.967
We need to figure out
some way

16:01.967 --> 16:03.734
to drive a wedge
between those two.

16:03.734 --> 16:04.867
You know, divide and conquer.

16:04.867 --> 16:06.134
Oh, yeah, but how?

16:06.134 --> 16:08.734
I'm not sure.

16:08.734 --> 16:11.800
Maybe we should sleep on it.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.800
Want to watch
some porn first?

16:16.334 --> 16:17.967
No.

16:19.433 --> 16:20.934
Why not?

16:23.001 --> 16:26.533
I'm drunk in bed in a hotel room
with my brother,

16:26.533 --> 16:29.634
and you want to know
why I don't want to watch porn?

16:31.167 --> 16:33.634
Okay. Okay, I get it.

16:33.634 --> 16:35.867
You don't want
to watch porn.

16:45.567 --> 16:47.867
Mind if I watch?

16:50.934 --> 16:53.134
(Danny screaming)

16:54.734 --> 16:56.767
<i>* Men. *</i>

16:56.767 --> 16:58.567
So they both just up and left, huh?

16:58.567 --> 16:59.500
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.201
Those boneless chickens.

17:02.201 --> 17:03.433
They'll be back.

17:03.433 --> 17:06.067
They just have to get used
to the way things are now.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.001
Damn right.

17:07.001 --> 17:08.834
Girl power, my bitches.

17:10.268 --> 17:12.367
Hey, Berta, why don't
you whip us up

17:12.367 --> 17:14.134
some French toast
to celebrate?

17:19.067 --> 17:21.666
Or, uh, we could do it.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.834
Good plan...

17:23.834 --> 17:25.532
my bitches.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.567
Hello, anybody home?

17:29.567 --> 17:31.368
In here.

17:31.368 --> 17:33.167
Oh, what a nice surprise.

17:33.167 --> 17:34.967
Good morning, ladies.

17:34.967 --> 17:37.001
Berta.

17:37.001 --> 17:39.167
Botox.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.001
So where are the
boys this morning?

17:42.268 --> 17:46.001
Oh well, Charlie's off, soaking
in a hotel.

17:46.001 --> 17:47.400
Oh, really?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.834
Well, what about Alan?

17:48.834 --> 17:51.567
Oh, Alan's too cheap for a hotel.

17:51.567 --> 17:54.034
I see.
And what brought this on?

17:54.034 --> 17:55.867
A lot of macho nonsense.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.433
Mm, and Alan?

17:58.433 --> 18:00.901
Just nonsense.

18:00.901 --> 18:02.400
No kidding.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.901
Well, I'm glad to see you didn't
let them get away with it.

18:04.901 --> 18:06.001
Thank you.
Thank you.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.667
And I'm doubly pleased
that you two

18:08.667 --> 18:11.800
have managed to put aside your
somewhat distasteful history

18:11.800 --> 18:14.368
and bond the way
you obviously have.

18:14.368 --> 18:15.767
What distasteful history?

18:15.767 --> 18:19.067
Oh, come on, let them 
make my breakfast first.

18:19.067 --> 18:21.034
What are you
talking about, Evelyn?

18:21.034 --> 18:24.467
A lot of women might resent
the former lover of their fiancé

18:24.467 --> 18:26.734
living in the same
house as them.

18:27.700 --> 18:30.567
It ain't me, start cooking.

18:31.667 --> 18:32.901
You and Charlie?

18:32.901 --> 18:34.433
Just one little weekend.

18:34.433 --> 18:38.001
But believe me, if I knew
what kind of man he was,

18:38.001 --> 18:39.201
What's that
supposed to mean?

18:39.201 --> 18:40.368
Oh, he's fine for you.

18:40.368 --> 18:41.767
Fine for me?!

18:41.767 --> 18:43.533
Well, I've got an early meeting.

18:43.533 --> 18:46.600
Nice to see you girls.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.834
Why didn't you
tell me?!

18:47.834 --> 18:49.001
I thought you
were my friend!

18:49.001 --> 18:50.400
I'm your friend?!

18:52.201 --> 18:53.533
Hey, if it weren't for me,

18:53.533 --> 18:55.368
your ass would've been
gone a long time ago...

18:55.368 --> 18:58.667
I believe the balance of power
is restored.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.301
Thanks, Mom.

19:00.301 --> 19:01.600
Thank you.

19:03.867 --> 19:06.368
You owe me large.

19:15.067 --> 19:17.368
All right, sweetheart,
I think yore overreacting,

19:17.368 --> 19:19.201
but if you want to spend
the night in a hotel

19:19.201 --> 19:20.468
that's fine.

19:20.468 --> 19:23.167
Hey, you want me to come over
for a quickie?

19:23.167 --> 19:25.667
Kidding. Love you.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.001
Damn.

19:27.001 --> 19:29.034
Hey, at least Chelsea's
coming back.

19:29.034 --> 19:31.500
Melissa said she'll never
set foot in this house again.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.334
All's well that ends well, huh?

19:35.401 --> 19:37.633
Bite me.

19:42.001 --> 19:45.434
Oh, come on, the important thing
is, we got the house back.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.667
And we're once again
kings of the castle.

19:47.667 --> 19:48.900
That's true.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.567
Hey, Celeste and
I are going  be

19:50.567 --> 19:52.167
studying in my room.
Okay.

19:52.167 --> 19:54.533
Oh, right.

19:54.533 --> 19:55.800
Set another place for dinner.

19:55.800 --> 19:56.900
She's going to be
joining us.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.167
Fine.

19:58.167 --> 20:01.767
Also, she's a vegetarian,
so no meat.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.334
Got it.

20:03.334 --> 20:04.633
Come on, Jake.

20:04.633 --> 20:08.900
Coming.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.633
Kings of the castle, my ass.

20:11.633 --> 20:14.434
We're whipped
unto the third generation.
