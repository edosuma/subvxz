00:27.210 --> 00:28.610
put the phone away.

00:28.630 --> 00:29.710
Uh, one more minute.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.510
That's what you said five
minutes ago. Now, put it away.

00:31.520 --> 00:32.040
Dad...

00:32.070 --> 00:34.210
I got you the phone
for emgencies, honey.

00:34.230 --> 00:36.450
Well, this is an emergency.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.930
Fine.

00:41.830 --> 00:44.260
wait, now, how come you get to
talk on the phone? That's not fair.

00:44.270 --> 00:46.770
Life's not fair. Hello.

00:47.740 --> 00:51.200
Hello? Who is this?

00:59.270 --> 01:02.730

01:50.750 --> 01:52.360
I've got money.

01:52.380 --> 01:55.090
We don't want your money, mr. Latham.

01:55.100 --> 01:58.100
We just need you to
fix something for us.

02:08.590 --> 02:11.880
Let the record show this is the
third day of this senate hearing

02:11.890 --> 02:17.110
investigating human rights violations by the
recently disbanded counter terrorist unit.

02:17.120 --> 02:22.250
Yesterday, when we adjourned, we
were discussing brutality and torture

02:22.550 --> 02:26.520
by ctu agents in the
course of their operations.

02:26.870 --> 02:29.780
Will the witness please state his name?

02:30.530 --> 02:32.290
Jack bauer.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.300
Mr. Bauer, I don't see
your counsel present.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.550
Is he or she not aware
that we're about to start?

02:38.570 --> 02:41.180
I have chosen not to retain counsel.

02:43.660 --> 02:47.170
Mr. Bauer, I have to advise you
that many of the questions that

02:47.190 --> 02:49.700
we' about to pose to
you are of a legal nature

02:49.710 --> 02:53.070
and might result in answers
that could incriminate you.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.570
I understand that, senator.

02:55.580 --> 02:59.890
We can postpone your testimony until this
afternoon if you'd like to bring in representation--

02:59.920 --> 03:03.230
something that I would strongly advise.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.240
What is the first question, senator?

03:07.810 --> 03:12.050
All right, then. Let's begin.

03:12.380 --> 03:16.990
Mr. Bauer, who is ibrahim hadad?

03:18.200 --> 03:20.490
That information is classified.

03:20.510 --> 03:23.340
We represent the people
of the united states,

03:23.350 --> 03:26.480
and we have declassified
those files on their behalf.

03:26.510 --> 03:32.080
Now, I'm going to ask you one
more time: Who is ibrahim hadad?

03:34.820 --> 03:40.190
He was a member of a terrorist sleeper
cell ctu had under surveillance in 2002.

03:40.780 --> 03:45.300
And isn't it true that you detained
mr. Hadad without due process,

03:45.340 --> 03:50.540
and that you used extreme
interrogation methods on him

03:50.550 --> 03:53.010
until he answered your questions?

03:53.020 --> 03:54.780
Yes, sir.

03:54.820 --> 03:58.520
Would you say that you broke
procedure with this interrogation?

03:58.530 --> 04:01.430
- Probably.
- Probably?

04:02.530 --> 04:05.970
Well, that's A... very cavalier answer.

04:05.980 --> 04:08.910
You don't seem to care
about the implications here.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.530
Well, mr. Bauer?

04:14.560 --> 04:17.660
I'm sorry, senator. I
didn't hear a question.

04:18.110 --> 04:20.579
All right, then.

04:21.180 --> 04:24.690
Did you torture mr. Hadad?

04:24.700 --> 04:30.660
According to the definitions set forth
by the geneva convention, yes, I did.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.240
Senator, why don't I save you some time.

04:33.260 --> 04:38.190
It's obvious that your agenda is to discredit
ctu and generate a series of indictments.

04:38.210 --> 04:40.780
My only agenda is to get to the truth.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.960
I don't think it is, sir.

04:42.980 --> 04:44.290
Excuse me?

04:44.300 --> 04:49.360
Ibrahim hadad had targeted a bus carrying
45 people, ten of which were children.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.850
The truth, senator, is I stopped
that attack from happening.

04:52.890 --> 04:54.350
By torturing mr. Hadad.

04:54.380 --> 04:57.630
By doing what I deemed necessary
to protect innocent lives.

04:57.650 --> 05:00.730
So, basically, what
you're saying, mr. Bauer,

05:00.740 --> 05:04.570
is that the ends justify the means,
and that you are above the law.

05:04.610 --> 05:07.820
When I am activated, when I am brought
into a situation, there is a reason.

05:07.850 --> 05:11.650
And that reason is to complete the
objectives of my mission at all costs.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.670
Even if it means breaking the law?

05:14.710 --> 05:17.830
For a combat soldier, the difference
between success and failure

05:17.840 --> 05:20.770
is your ability to adapt to your enemy.

05:20.790 --> 05:23.680
The people that I deal with--
they don't care about your rules.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.290
All they care about is a result.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.480
My job is to stop them from
accomplishing their objectives.

05:29.510 --> 05:32.020
I simply adapted.

05:32.030 --> 05:36.060
In answer to your question,
am I above the law? No, sir.

05:36.070 --> 05:40.280
I am more than willing to be judged
by the people you claim to represent.

05:40.320 --> 05:43.600
I will let them decide
what price I should pay.

05:43.650 --> 05:46.420
But please do not sit there
with that smug look on your face

05:46.450 --> 05:49.790
and expect me to regret the
decisions that I have made,

05:49.800 --> 05:54.170
because, sir, the truth is, I don'T.

05:54.670 --> 05:57.550
Excuse me, sir.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.600
sorry for interrupting, senator.
I'm renee walker with the fbi.

06:13.610 --> 06:15.130
We have a subpoena for jack bauer.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.520
I need him remanded into
my custody immediately.

06:18.870 --> 06:22.350
I'm not surprised that anyone
has a subpoena for mr. Bauer,

06:22.360 --> 06:23.990
but right now, you're going
to have to wait your turn.

06:24.010 --> 06:25.790
He's being questioned by
the united states senate.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.240
Sir, we need mr. Bauer immediately.

06:38.480 --> 06:43.990
Well, apparently, we're going
to have to let you go for w,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.520
but we're not done with you.

06:46.530 --> 06:50.140
We'll reconvene with you tomorrow morning
at the same time. Is that understood?

06:50.430 --> 06:51.730
Yes, sir.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.660
All right. Then you go
along with these agents.

07:08.180 --> 07:11.410
Well, let's proceed.

07:11.420 --> 07:14.570
Bailiff, call the next witness.

07:14.930 --> 07:16.310
What is this about?

07:16.330 --> 07:18.480
Mr. Bauer, I'm special agent
walker. This is agent teller.

07:18.490 --> 07:19.940
We need you to come
with us to our office.

07:19.950 --> 07:22.260
- It's just down the block.
- Why?

07:22.270 --> 07:24.730
You'll be briefed when we get there.

07:28.290 --> 07:30.370
- Hello?
- Janis, it's me. Where's larry?

07:30.380 --> 07:32.260
He's briefing dornan's group.

07:32.270 --> 07:34.510
Tell him I've got bauer,
we're leaving the hearing now.

07:34.530 --> 07:36.790
Well, that's good, 'cause
the situation's heating up.

07:36.810 --> 07:37.790
What are you talking about?

07:37.800 --> 07:39.290
That crew we've been tracking?

07:39.300 --> 07:42.290
They just grabbed a man
named michael latham.

07:42.300 --> 07:45.030
Latham? He worked on
homeland's firewall project.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.090
Oh, he didn't just work
on it, he designed it.

07:47.110 --> 07:51.060
He's the chief engineer of the
government's infrastructure security system.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.640
All right, I'll be there soon.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.690
Did you get bauer cleared
through security yet?

07:58.710 --> 07:59.490
Not yet.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.190
Well, renee's bringing him in.
They're only a couple minutes out.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.690
Then you won't need him
cleared for a couple of minutes.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.670
- Sean, as a friend, I'd like to keep...
- you're not my friend.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.060
Sure.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.870
As someone as close to a friend as you are
ever going to get, let me give you some advice.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.750
Most people don't like sarcasm.

08:16.770 --> 08:19.190
I myself have no problem
with it, 'cause I'm cheerful.

08:19.220 --> 08:21.380
I'm a cheerful person.

08:21.390 --> 08:23.630
You're a cheerful person?

08:24.650 --> 08:27.380
Just get bauer cleared.

08:27.390 --> 08:31.930
For the past eight weeks, this office has been
investigating a series of technology thefts--

08:31.950 --> 08:35.730
software, custom gate array
chips, neural networks.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.669
Forensics concluded that the break-ins
were the work of the same crew,

08:38.700 --> 08:42.809
but we didn't know what
their end game was until now.

08:44.940 --> 08:46.460
This is michael latham.

08:46.490 --> 08:51.550
He's chief engineer on the classified
infrastructure portal, homeland's firewall project.

08:51.580 --> 08:55.720
He was abducted ten minutes ago by the
same group behind the technology thefts.

08:55.740 --> 08:58.370
You think they're using this guy
latham to get through the cip firewall?

08:58.380 --> 08:59.310
That's our concern.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.840
The hardware they stole could be used
to build a device to do just that.

09:01.860 --> 09:04.530
And latham's one of the
few people that could do it.

09:04.540 --> 09:08.420
We assume he's being forced to work on
the device, or that he's already dead.

09:08.430 --> 09:11.050
Excuse me-- renee's on
her way in with jack bauer.

09:11.060 --> 09:12.900
Thank you.

09:12.910 --> 09:16.880
We've tasked your people to help this
investigation. See sean. He's got the packets.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.060
We're on it.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.580
we're on line with gsa 117.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.700
How many systems?

09:29.720 --> 09:32.170
Communications, navigation...

09:32.200 --> 09:36.000
but we need the other systems
working. Check on latham.

09:57.480 --> 10:01.140
all right... it's done.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.780
northeast three, this
is global skies 117.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.930
We are ready for clearance.

10:10.950 --> 10:12.530
Gsa 117, roger.

10:12.550 --> 10:14.520
You're clear to jfk airport as filed.

10:14.540 --> 10:16.080
Maintain 5,000.

10:16.110 --> 10:19.410
Expect flight level of 280
ten minutes after departure.

10:19.420 --> 10:22.810
Cleared to jfk. Expect flight level 280.

10:23.880 --> 10:29.760
Welcome to global skies flight number 117,
passenger service from reagan-national to jfk.

10:29.790 --> 10:32.470
Weather in new york is cloudy
with a chance of thunder showers,

10:32.490 --> 10:35.960
so we may run into some
turbulence along the way.

10:39.290 --> 10:42.240
Tower to skies, awaiting
traffic off of dulles.

10:42.250 --> 10:45.120
Position hold, gsa 117.

10:45.140 --> 10:48.120
Gsa 117, that's correct.

11:04.490 --> 11:05.960
mr. Bauer?

11:05.980 --> 11:08.660
I'm agent larry moss. I'm
the head of this office.

11:08.670 --> 11:13.120
You're here because agent walker thinks you
might be able to help us with an investigation.

11:13.140 --> 11:19.250
Now, personally, I have my doubts,
but I'll be happy to be proven wrong.

11:19.270 --> 11:22.010
Well, cky for me, I'm not here
to apply for a job, agent moss.

11:22.040 --> 11:26.390
Personally, I don't care what makes you
happy, so let's just get this over with.

11:27.940 --> 11:30.710
Take him to renee's office.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.030
Do you want me in the room with you?

11:38.550 --> 11:41.270
- No.
- Renee...

11:42.060 --> 11:43.370
you've read his file.

11:43.390 --> 11:46.640
Bauer's the kind of guy you say
the wrong thing, he can go off.

11:46.660 --> 11:49.020
I'll be fine, larry.

11:50.370 --> 11:52.070
If he goes off, I'll call you.

11:52.080 --> 11:56.480
All right, but if he doesn't produce,
don't waste our time. Throw him back.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.590
What do you want?

12:02.620 --> 12:05.730
Mr. Bauer, we have a national
security matter that has gone critical.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.220
I'm hoping you can help us with it.

12:08.690 --> 12:11.440
Please sit down.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.890
I sent the differentials to homeland.

12:23.440 --> 12:26.100
Was there anything else
you needed me to do?

12:26.110 --> 12:27.900
No.

12:29.460 --> 12:31.390
Has bauer been indicted yet?

12:31.400 --> 12:33.980
No, but he will be after
the senate hearings.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.110
The cip firewall protects every major
infrastructure system in this country--

12:38.130 --> 12:41.840
if it were breached, telecommunication,
transportation, power grids--

12:41.870 --> 12:43.790
they would all be vulnerable.

12:43.810 --> 12:45.980
- Agent walker, right?
- Yes.

12:45.990 --> 12:47.720
I'm not active.

12:47.740 --> 12:50.440
The doj is about to file
criminal charges against me;

12:50.470 --> 12:54.110
I'm not exactly in a position
to help you with your situation.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.640
As much as I understand
how dire it is...

12:56.650 --> 12:59.970
no, I don't think you do.

13:00.690 --> 13:04.130
One of the men behind this threat...

13:05.060 --> 13:08.190
is someone you know.

13:26.750 --> 13:29.420
That's not possible.

13:29.430 --> 13:31.880
Tony almeida is dead.

13:31.890 --> 13:34.510
- Apparently not.
- I was there when he died.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.070
And he was rushed away by
the emts a minute later.

13:37.100 --> 13:42.130
You never saw him after that, and hours later
you were abducted by the chinese government.

13:47.690 --> 13:51.250
No. No.

13:51.940 --> 13:54.960
If tony were still alive, I would
know. He would have contacted me.

13:54.970 --> 13:59.910
We recovered this image from a security camera
where one of the technology thefts took place.

14:00.620 --> 14:03.850
It's time-stamped and dated.

14:05.820 --> 14:07.260
Images can be manipulated.

14:07.290 --> 14:09.530
Not this one.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.680
I'm sorry, I don't believe it.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.940
I had almeida's grave exhumed.

14:25.770 --> 14:30.700
Dna tests confirmed that it was
not his body that was buried.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.600
The evidence is right here.

14:33.610 --> 14:37.740
If you want to leave without
looking at it, go ahead.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.130
Gsa 117 on a roll.

15:06.170 --> 15:07.630
Masters?

15:07.680 --> 15:09.200
Yes,sir.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.240
Are we in their system?

15:13.280 --> 15:14.770
Yes.

15:39.490 --> 15:42.930
Roger tower,gsa 117,switching
to departure 126.8

15:42.950 --> 15:44.390
Have a good day.

15:44.410 --> 15:45.430
What's the problem?

15:45.460 --> 15:48.530
The cip module--
it stopped working.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.990
What do you mean it stopped?

15:51.550 --> 15:54.000
It keeps going out of phase.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.930
I thought latham said it was good to go.

15:56.970 --> 15:58.820
Well,it's not.

15:59.430 --> 16:01.490
All right,let me have it.

16:19.710 --> 16:21.920
So what did you do?

16:22.190 --> 16:23.930
I didn't do anything.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.240
I swear.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.360
Then why isn't it working?

16:27.380 --> 16:29.350
I don't know.

16:29.630 --> 16:30.950
Fix it.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.880
Now.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.580
you're gonna want to
move faster than that.

16:43.610 --> 16:49.900
See,'cause if you can't make this work in
the next few minutes,I won't need you anymore.

16:49.930 --> 16:52.110
You understand what that means?

16:52.130 --> 16:53.560
Good.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.200
Now fix it.

17:12.300 --> 17:17.040
Officials say that an estimated 300,000
civilians-- men,women,and children--

17:17.069 --> 17:22.369
have been killed as part of general
benjamin juma's campaign of ethnic cleansing.

17:22.390 --> 17:24.990
Survivors in the african
nation of sangala,

17:25.020 --> 17:29.780
believe american intervention is
necessary to prevent further bloodshed.

17:29.820 --> 17:32.710
The white house has made
no public statements...

17:32.720 --> 17:36.900
juma's perpetrating the worst mass
murder africa has seen since rwanda.

17:36.930 --> 17:37.850
But if you read the columns...

17:37.880 --> 17:38.610
I do.

17:38.620 --> 17:41.220
Half of them are against
our taking action.

17:41.250 --> 17:42.450
But if we don'T...

17:42.470 --> 17:48.060
six months from now,those same members of the
press will be accusing us of moral bankruptcy.

17:48.290 --> 17:49.920
We can always revisit the un option.

17:49.960 --> 17:55.140
The un's paralyzed,ethan,while people
are being butchered by that madman.

17:55.180 --> 17:56.860
We have to lead.

17:56.890 --> 18:00.100
Even if it means going it alone.

18:00.140 --> 18:04.680
I'm not gonna have hundreds of
thousands of lives on my conscience.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.440
General juma has to be stopped.

18:07.470 --> 18:09.240
He will be,madame president.

18:09.270 --> 18:11.580
As soon as you give the order.

18:11.670 --> 18:13.340
Are the joint chiefs here yet?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.550
They're gathering in the situation room.

18:14.580 --> 18:17.120
They'll call as soon as
they're ready for you.

18:17.170 --> 18:20.050
I just heard kevin aldrich
is doing a piece for cnb.

18:20.080 --> 18:23.190
He's still pressing his case
against sending our troops in.

18:23.220 --> 18:25.610
As if getting through this
day won't be hard enough.

18:25.640 --> 18:29.260
If you want,I can sit down with him and try
to get him to hold off; he's in the press room.

18:29.290 --> 18:31.120
I'm not sure that's a good idea,henry.

18:31.150 --> 18:35.850
This is the last thing you need right
now,especially with public opinion so split.

18:42.450 --> 18:47.170
if you think you can
talk aldrich down,do it.

18:47.330 --> 18:50.960
Madame president,the
joint chiefs are ready.

18:51.940 --> 18:54.850
Here's your briefing package.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.330
Wish me luck.

19:06.350 --> 19:08.070
Good luck.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.020
Is this everything?

19:15.050 --> 19:16.620
It's all there.

19:25.070 --> 19:27.470
I don't mean to sound
like a broken record,

19:27.500 --> 19:30.760
but I'm not sure your husband
is up to handling aldrich.

19:30.790 --> 19:32.070
Henry's fine.

19:32.090 --> 19:33.720
He's better,I realize that,but...

19:33.740 --> 19:36.890
it's going to take
more than a few months.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.430
He lost a son.

19:38.450 --> 19:40.400
So did you.

19:41.070 --> 19:44.980
And you haven't let your
loss interfere with your job.

19:50.020 --> 19:55.740
Your husband is a strong man,but
he doesn't have your resilience.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.930
It's not a matter of resilience,ethan.

19:58.970 --> 20:05.000
There's not a day that goes by,not a
moment when i don't think about my son.

20:05.010 --> 20:12.260
But I'm about to take this nation to war and
grief is a luxury I can't afford right now.

20:22.720 --> 20:29.340
Before we begin,let me thank each of you for
the time and work you've put into this operation.

20:29.370 --> 20:35.170
Putting american lives at risk is the
hardest decision I've ever had to make...

20:35.190 --> 20:39.020
but it is one that has to be made.

20:44.100 --> 20:45.950
what was that?

20:46.020 --> 20:47.670
It's working.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.450
What was wrong?

20:48.480 --> 20:52.080
It was overheating. I
came up with a workaround.

21:04.570 --> 21:06.380
Try it now.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.670
There.

21:18.710 --> 21:19.490
Yeah.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.290
It's transmitting again.

21:21.300 --> 21:24.250
We can send and receive.

21:26.940 --> 21:29.870
Double a-123 maintain course.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.030
What was that?

21:33.050 --> 21:34.730
I just got it,too.

21:34.760 --> 21:35.590
Did you guys lose synch?

21:35.620 --> 21:38.920
Yeah. I did,but we're back up now.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.940
Anybody else lose synch?

21:41.970 --> 21:42.760
No,I'm good.

21:42.790 --> 21:44.460
No,I'm fine.

21:44.890 --> 21:46.820
What's going on,phil?

21:46.840 --> 21:50.100
This is gonna sound crazy,but the three
of us just got bumped for a second.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.480
But the log file doesn't
show a power surge.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.980
This came from the system kernel.

21:55.580 --> 21:56.790
What are you talking about?

21:56.820 --> 21:58.710
The kernel's protected.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.500
Let me have a look.

22:04.980 --> 22:09.530
All we know for sure is that almeida is part of a homegrown
terrorist group that's targeting our infrastructure.

22:09.550 --> 22:11.560
He could be working undercover,some
kind of sting operation.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.030
You need to check
every federal agency--

22:13.040 --> 22:14.420
we have. State and city,too.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.070
Almeida's not working for any of them.

22:16.090 --> 22:17.190
Then there must be
some other explanation.

22:17.240 --> 22:18.530
Yeah,there is.

22:18.540 --> 22:23.660
His wife was brutally murdered by a faction operating
inside the government,led by the president himself.

22:23.690 --> 22:26.770
Everybody involved in that is
either in prison or has been killed.

22:26.790 --> 22:30.070
The government gave president logan a
slap on the wrist,they cut him a deal.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.390
Sentencing him to house arrest
on a hundred-acre ranch...

22:32.410 --> 22:34.960
And you think tony's looking for
justice by attacking this country?

22:34.990 --> 22:40.830
Almeida lost everything he had,and he's blaming
it on the government he spent his life serving.

22:45.450 --> 22:49.120
But you'd know better
than me how that feels...

22:49.610 --> 22:52.400
how far a man might go.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.330
Not that far.

22:56.350 --> 22:58.370
And not tony almeida.

22:58.380 --> 23:00.560
There's a logical explanation for this.

23:00.590 --> 23:02.180
It's just something you're not seeing.

23:02.200 --> 23:06.180
Help me find almeida and
you can ask him yourself.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.900
You know how he thinks.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.010
You had the same training.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.820
You know the same people.

23:18.350 --> 23:20.560
I'm going to need complete access
to all of your source material--

23:20.560 --> 23:23.210
everything you've got on this.

23:23.980 --> 23:24.690
yes?

23:24.700 --> 23:26.350
Renee,come out here.
Something just came in.

23:26.380 --> 23:27.350
Be right there.

23:27.370 --> 23:29.750
Everything we have on almeida's
crew is in this directory.

23:29.780 --> 23:31.220
Start here...

23:31.840 --> 23:33.940
I'll be right back.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.260
What's going on?

23:43.300 --> 23:44.990
Northeast air traffic
control just called.

23:45.010 --> 23:47.970
They reported a possible intrusion
into their communication systems.

23:48.000 --> 23:48.880
It just happened.

23:48.910 --> 23:49.930
Can th source them?

23:49.960 --> 23:52.310
They're trying,but so far,nothing.

23:52.340 --> 23:54.350
Why do we think this has
to do with almeida's crew?

23:54.370 --> 23:57.130
I don't think you get intrusions
like this unless someone's driving it,

23:57.130 --> 24:00.670
and the only way to drive it
is through the cip firewall.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.710
So they're going after
air traffic control.

24:02.740 --> 24:04.640
That's what it looks like.

24:05.930 --> 24:08.220
Put me through to the white house.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.890
You doing a turnaround in new york?

24:12.930 --> 24:15.200
Nope. Got two days off.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.740
I'm meeting my boyfriend in the city.

24:16.770 --> 24:19.990
Oh,that'll be fun.

24:26.730 --> 24:29.760
well,doug said we were
going to hit some weather.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.810
I'm going to need tech support
to cross-reference your files.

24:38.830 --> 24:40.780
You'll be working with one
of my analysts,sean hillinger.

24:40.810 --> 24:43.010
He can get you whatever files
you need to help us find almeida.

24:43.050 --> 24:43.790
Good.

24:43.790 --> 24:45.340
They raise the threat level yet?

24:45.380 --> 24:48.550
yeah. We think almeida's gup
got into air traffic control.

24:48.580 --> 24:49.270
What?

24:49.290 --> 24:50.590
That doesn't make sense.

24:50.610 --> 24:51.900
I don't need you to figure it out,jack.

24:51.930 --> 24:53.370
Just help me find him.

24:53.390 --> 24:54.900
Sean,this is jack bauer.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.430
He's going to be working
with the almeida files.

24:56.450 --> 24:57.460
Give him whatever he needs.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.170
What about interfacing with faa?

24:59.210 --> 25:00.940
Janis is working with some
of dornan's people on that.

25:00.970 --> 25:02.070
You just help jack.

25:02.090 --> 25:03.260
Fine.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.210
I'll check in.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.720
Thanks.

25:05.830 --> 25:07.490
What do you want to see?

25:07.510 --> 25:08.800
Let's start with the technology thefts.

25:08.810 --> 25:10.140
How many were there?

25:10.160 --> 25:11.190
Six.

25:11.220 --> 25:13.800
Let's run a comp on all of them.

25:13.820 --> 25:15.830
Fantastic.

25:19.340 --> 25:22.980
The expeditionary strike force and
its carrier air wing are now on scene.

25:23.010 --> 25:26.170
This gives us full spectrum
dominance of the battle space.

25:26.200 --> 25:29.870
What kind of resistance are you
anticipating from juma's military?

25:29.910 --> 25:31.480
Minimal.

25:31.580 --> 25:34.550
Our air strikes will take out
whatever defenses they've got.

25:34.590 --> 25:37.190
We can expect an open
path to juma's front door.

25:37.220 --> 25:38.580
Good.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.230
All we need to launch
is a go order from you.

25:41.250 --> 25:45.960
You'll get a green light as soon as I've gone
over secretary stevens' post-invasion report,

25:45.990 --> 25:47.780
which I'm still waiting for.

25:47.810 --> 25:50.640
I'll have it for you
in a few minutes,ma'am.

25:51.070 --> 25:54.670
Unless there's a problem
you'd like to discuss.

25:54.690 --> 25:58.900
Madame president,my objection to this
operation isn't a secret to anyone in this room.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.710
For us to be wading into the middle of another
civil conflict halfway around the world...

26:01.730 --> 26:04.150
we're done debating this,joe.

26:04.180 --> 26:07.070
The un's been issuing
reprimands and economic sanctions

26:07.100 --> 26:11.160
while benjamin juma has slaughtered
over 200,000 of his own people.

26:11.180 --> 26:15.310
That number will continue to
grow if we don't stop him now.

26:15.330 --> 26:20.430
And if you can't get behind what we're
doing,I'll find a secretary of state who can.

26:20.460 --> 26:23.830
But I am done with your handwringing.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.110
Excuse me,madame president.

26:26.130 --> 26:29.240
Tim woods from homeland
security is outside.

26:29.260 --> 26:31.390
He needs to see you on another matter.

26:31.420 --> 26:32.400
Can it wait?

26:32.430 --> 26:34.560
No,ma'am,it can'T.

26:35.390 --> 26:36.380
All right.

26:36.390 --> 26:38.550
We'll continue when I return.

26:38.560 --> 26:43.860
And,joe,I want that report in
front of me when I get back.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.110
What is it?

26:53.140 --> 26:56.100
I don't have the details,but it
involves a potential domestic breach.

26:56.130 --> 26:57.350
Tim is here to fill us in.

26:57.380 --> 26:58.230
Madame president.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.990
Tim,make this brief; the
joint chiefs are waiting.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.480
We've been working with the
fbi the last eight weeks,

27:03.520 --> 27:05.970
investigating a series
of technology thefts.

27:06.020 --> 27:08.400
We didn't understand the
implications of this until today.

27:08.440 --> 27:11.710
The same people behind these thefts
abducted a man named michael latham.

27:11.750 --> 27:15.130
He's one of the chief engineers in charge
of protecting critical infrastructure.

27:15.140 --> 27:16.760
Now,tell me what we're dealing with.

27:16.790 --> 27:22.960
The fbi thinks these same people have forced latham
to create a device to hack through the cip firewall.

27:22.980 --> 27:27.930
The firewall protects all national
systems: Energy,utilities,transportation...

27:27.960 --> 27:34.330
I'm here because the faa reported some
irregularities in their air traffic control system.

27:34.360 --> 27:37.580
Are you saying commercial
flights are in danger?

27:37.600 --> 27:39.530
Possibly.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.440
Do I need to give the
order to ground air traffic?

27:42.460 --> 27:44.290
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

27:44.310 --> 27:47.510
Right now,there are more than 3,000
flights over the continental united states.

27:47.550 --> 27:52.520
To ground them all would take 12
hours,minimum,and it could create a panic.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.610
Then what do you recommend?

27:54.630 --> 27:57.980
Let us quietly decrease air traffic
while the bureau works their leads.

27:58.020 --> 28:01.260
We'll make sure you're
briefed on a real-time basis.

28:01.490 --> 28:03.750
I don't like the timing of this...

28:03.780 --> 28:04.680
timing?

28:04.710 --> 28:07.640
Could this be connected to
our intervention in sangala?

28:07.670 --> 28:09.640
The fbi hasn't found any connection.

28:09.660 --> 28:12.420
All the evidence suggests that we're
dealing with a domestic terror group,

28:12.450 --> 28:15.110
homegrown,with a
strong,anti-government bias.

28:15.140 --> 28:16.530
And these leads
you mentioned--

28:16.580 --> 28:20.850
do you think you'll be able to catch these
people before they do any real damage?

28:20.890 --> 28:24.380
The bureau's got everyone on it,ma'am.

28:24.390 --> 28:26.190
You didn't answer my question.

28:26.210 --> 28:28.250
No,ma'am. I didn'T.

28:41.540 --> 28:44.340
Of course,I don't condone
what juma's doing over there.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.380
But tribal wars are being
fought all over the world.

28:46.390 --> 28:48.520
Why not intervene in thailand,malaysia?

28:48.550 --> 28:50.330
This isn't a tribal war,kevin.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.760
It's a genocide.

28:51.790 --> 28:55.340
Ending it is the moral obligation
of a nation as powerful as ours.

28:55.370 --> 28:59.240
That's a lofty aspiration,but
the reality is a lot more complex.

28:59.270 --> 29:02.110
The president's going into
this with both eyes open.

29:02.140 --> 29:05.750
How can she be sure thcycle of violence
won't coinue after juma's been taken out?

29:05.800 --> 29:09.140
Could be stuck there
indefinitely...keeping the peace.

29:09.180 --> 29:15.990
If I gave you an exclusive preview of the president's
post-invasion plans,you might change your mind.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.200
You're trying to bribe
me with an exclusive?

29:18.240 --> 29:20.860
I'm trying to get you
to give us some rope.

29:21.610 --> 29:25.050
What are you asking me to do,stop
writing or write what I don't believe?

29:25.070 --> 29:27.960
Either one would be fine with me.

29:31.660 --> 29:34.260
Sir,you have a phone
call on your private line.

29:34.290 --> 29:37.560
Could you excuse me for
a moment,please,kevin.

29:44.890 --> 29:47.460
It's chuck toland,sir.

29:47.550 --> 29:49.300
Wait.

29:50.550 --> 29:52.680
Chuck,did you find something?

29:52.700 --> 29:54.640
I did,but don't get carried away.

29:54.670 --> 29:57.120
It doesn't confirm your
theory about how roger died.

29:57.150 --> 29:59.830
But it is suspicious.

29:59.840 --> 30:00.750
I'm listening.

30:00.780 --> 30:07.400
His girlfriend samantha received a large lump-sum deposit in an
off-shore bank account about three days after roger's suicide.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.740
You mean his alleged suicide.

30:09.770 --> 30:11.570
Right,sir.

30:11.580 --> 30:12.990
Where did the money come from?

30:13.000 --> 30:13.780
I couldn't tell.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.260
It looks like it's been washed.

30:15.290 --> 30:17.870
There's no readily identifiable source.

30:17.910 --> 30:19.770
So...what does this mean?

30:19.800 --> 30:23.700
All it means is that she
suddenly came into $400,000.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.900
If we're going to find out anything more,I'm
going to need to talk to her personally.

30:26.940 --> 30:29.170
Is that how you want me to handle it?

30:29.320 --> 30:33.630
no, If she's got anything to hide,she's
not going to talk to a private investigator.

30:33.660 --> 30:34.450
I agree.

30:34.470 --> 30:36.790
So how do you want me to proceed?

30:36.800 --> 30:38.360
I'll talk to her myself.

30:38.380 --> 30:39.860
Is she still at that brokerage firm?

30:39.890 --> 30:41.940
Yeah,uh,sloane kittridge.

30:41.980 --> 30:43.480
Good.

30:44.740 --> 30:46.820
I'm going to finish up here with aldrich.

30:46.820 --> 30:49.630
Then I need you to take me somewhere,and keep it off the manifest.

30:49.630 --> 30:51.850
I don't want anyone to know where we're going.

30:52.010 --> 30:53.860
-Yes,sir.
-Agent gedge.

30:53.860 --> 30:55.550
Yes,sir.

30:56.470 --> 30:59.590
You think chuck's taking advantage of me,don't you?

30:59.590 --> 31:01.090
It's not my place to say that,sir.

31:01.090 --> 31:03.690
I'm asking you anyway.

31:03.690 --> 31:07.860
Sir,the police and fbi have both investigated your son's death.

31:07.860 --> 31:12.830
And yes,I believe this pi could be exploiting your grief for personal gain.

31:12.830 --> 31:16.550
These so-called leads that he's generating have led nowhere.

31:16.550 --> 31:19.360
My son didn't kill himself.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.690
I'm sure of it.

31:21.690 --> 31:24.100
Yes,sir.

31:26.940 --> 31:29.210
Can you check that socket again,please?

31:29.210 --> 31:30.970
Has faa reported any more anomalies?

31:30.970 --> 31:32.090
Not since the first three.

31:32.090 --> 31:33.850
Maybe it was just a glitch?

31:33.850 --> 31:36.850
Or it could have been a ripple caused when they broke through the firewall and entered the system.

31:36.850 --> 31:40.910
Well,if they're in the system,I can't see them,and I've checked every elr socket.

31:40.910 --> 31:42.110
Keep looking.

31:42.110 --> 31:43.760
Renee...

31:44.400 --> 31:46.920
uh,what's going to happen?

31:46.920 --> 31:47.720
What do you mean?

31:47.720 --> 31:50.600
If almeida has broken through the firewall then we're screwed,right?

31:50.600 --> 31:52.870
I mean,crashing couple planes is really nothing compared to

31:52.870 --> 31:55.630
contaminating the water system or bringing down the power grid...

31:55.630 --> 31:57.360
don't think about it,janis.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.650
Just stay tasK.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.440
okay,so...

32:02.440 --> 32:05.710
I will just stay calm,right?

32:05.710 --> 32:06.980
Yeah.

32:12.950 --> 32:14.480
Pull up the second one.

32:14.480 --> 32:15.610
You already looked at it.

32:15.610 --> 32:17.820
I want to look at it again,pull it up.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.810
Have you found anything?

32:21.810 --> 32:25.100
No,we keep looking at the same six forensic reports over and over.

32:25.100 --> 32:26.220
What are you looking for,jack?

32:26.220 --> 32:27.460
An entry point.

32:27.460 --> 32:28.370
They had access cards.

32:28.370 --> 32:31.360
Yeah,but no one reported their access cards stolen,which means they were forged.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.110
So...

32:32.110 --> 32:36.010
These access cards have individual signatures,making them almost impossible to forge.

32:36.010 --> 32:38.300
There's only a couple guys who can do it.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.190
Can you access old ctu files?

32:40.190 --> 32:41.290
Sure.

32:41.290 --> 32:43.450
Pull up august 1999.

32:43.450 --> 32:45.550
Code name: Hatteras.

32:46.740 --> 32:48.510
Just got a call from homeland.

32:48.510 --> 32:50.830
They briefed the president but she's not ready to ground planes yet.

32:50.830 --> 32:52.290
Here you go.Hatteras file.

32:52.290 --> 32:56.110
You know,you can hire a $14.00-an-hour data applications geek to do this;

32:56.110 --> 32:57.100
you don't need me.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.440
I wouldn't advertise that.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.790
There he is-- gabriel schector.

33:01.790 --> 33:02.590
Who is he?

33:02.590 --> 33:03.440
He was a supplier.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.640
Tony and I used him to buy things off-book.

33:05.640 --> 33:08.360
See if he's in your database.

33:09.700 --> 33:11.260
Yeah.He's there.

33:11.260 --> 33:13.330
Is he still in los angeles?

33:13.330 --> 33:16.960
No.According to this earmark,he came to dc nine weeks ago.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.710
The thefts started a week after that.

33:19.710 --> 33:21.560
That's your guy.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.590
Do you have an address?

33:22.590 --> 33:27.580
He's subletting an office downtown-- 1208 naylor road,suite 630.

33:27.580 --> 33:29.440
All right,put a field team together,pick him up.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.040
I'll call judge simons,have a warrant ready.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.520
That's a mistake.

33:32.520 --> 33:33.180
Why?

33:33.180 --> 33:35.060
You don't have time to go through the motions with schector--

33:35.060 --> 33:39.340
you serve him with a warrant,he'll call his lawyers,he'll stall as long as he needs.

33:39.340 --> 33:42.540
So,what's the alternative,jack?

33:42.540 --> 33:45.170
Break in and torture the guy,like you used to do?

33:45.170 --> 33:48.510
Isn't that how you ended up in front of a senate sub-committee?

33:50.440 --> 33:52.190
Oh,is this how it starts?

33:52.190 --> 33:55.470
You get in my face,tighten your jaw,then if I say something you don't like,

33:55.470 --> 33:57.380
you slam me against the wall.

33:57.380 --> 34:00.060
You have no idea what I do.

34:00.060 --> 34:02.550
And last time I checked,you subpoenaed me.

34:02.550 --> 34:04.450
You want my help,you want my advice,take it.

34:04.450 --> 34:06.110
You don't,don'T.

34:06.110 --> 34:08.409
-I don't care.
-Mr. Bauer...

34:08.409 --> 34:10.110
you said you used to work with this man schector.

34:10.110 --> 34:12.540
How well does he know you?

34:12.540 --> 34:14.739
He knows me.

34:14.739 --> 34:17.560
Larry,can I talk to you for a second?

34:29.480 --> 34:30.610
I want to take ber with me.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.600
No.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.739
Forget it.I'm not letting him put his hands on a suspect.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.429
He won't need to put his hands on anybody.

34:35.429 --> 34:37.840
My guess is if he's in the room,schector will talk.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.060
Renee,you saw what he just...

34:39.060 --> 34:41.469
I'm trying to find almeida before it's too late,

34:41.469 --> 34:43.760
and schector is our best lead.

34:43.760 --> 34:46.139
So you want to intimidate him wi bauer?

34:46.139 --> 34:47.989
Schector knows how far bauer might go.

34:47.989 --> 34:49.050
Let's use that.

34:49.050 --> 34:51.270
Yeah,and if schector doesn't blink,then what?

34:51.270 --> 34:52.909
I'll keep bauer on a short leash.

34:52.909 --> 34:55.400
Renee,we're the fbi,not ctu.

34:55.400 --> 34:56.690
We honor the law.

34:56.690 --> 34:58.150
Even when it's not convenient.

34:58.150 --> 35:00.490
Look,this situation is heating up fast,larry.

35:00.490 --> 35:02.900
The president's into it now,and she's expecting results.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.450
Yeah,I know.

35:05.450 --> 35:07.310
It's your call.

35:07.310 --> 35:11.310
But I promise you,can handle bauer.

35:17.830 --> 35:18.990
All right.

35:18.990 --> 35:21.190
But I'm holding you responsible.

35:21.190 --> 35:23.710
And I'm sending backup teams.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.310
Jack.

35:27.650 --> 35:30.930
You're coming with me,and you're doing this my way.

35:46.930 --> 35:49.130
Tell me about schector.

35:49.500 --> 35:53.660
Out of san diego,till he went on his own.

35:53.660 --> 35:54.440
Legitimate?

35:54.440 --> 35:56.340
Yeah,at first,then he got greedy.

35:56.340 --> 36:00.130
Started using his connections to acquire technology,sell it on the gray market.

36:00.130 --> 36:01.670
Who'd he sell to,terrorists?

36:01.670 --> 36:04.590
No.Usually foreign governments trying to get around treaties.

36:04.590 --> 36:06.470
And how did you and tony get involved with him?

36:06.470 --> 36:08.220
We arrested him,we turned him.

36:08.220 --> 36:10.330
He was a great conduit for intel.

36:10.330 --> 36:12.640
Ctu didn't mind that you were letting this guy stay in business?

36:12.640 --> 36:14.300
Ctu didn't know.

36:14.300 --> 36:16.650
It was just tony and me.

36:16.650 --> 36:18.980
So you and tony were tight?

36:18.980 --> 36:20.630
Yeah...

36:20.900 --> 36:23.270
yeah,we were close.

36:23.270 --> 36:26.040
All right,so it sounds like tony,who everyone thinks is dead,

36:26.040 --> 36:28.320
puts together a plan to hijack american security.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.670
He contacts schector to help him with this plan.

36:30.670 --> 36:32.300
Yeah.

36:32.300 --> 36:33.550
Except you don't believe it.

36:33.550 --> 36:35.250
That tony's dirty.

36:35.250 --> 36:37.090
I believe that tony's alive.

36:37.090 --> 36:40.790
And I believe he's doing something dangerous,and that we need to find him.

37:02.580 --> 37:04.060
We confirmed schector's inside.

37:04.060 --> 37:05.280
How do you want to handle this?

37:05.280 --> 37:06.630
I'm going in with bauer.

37:06.630 --> 37:07.620
Alone?

37:07.620 --> 37:08.710
I want schector to talk.

37:08.710 --> 37:09.680
I don't want to spook him.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.590
Call me when backup gets here.

37:17.140 --> 37:20.990
Matobo's fighters are hidden outside the capitol in three camps.

37:21.290 --> 37:24.050
Alpha,beta and delta.

37:24.050 --> 37:27.420
Our ground forces will join up with them once the air strikes are completed.

37:27.420 --> 37:33.250
Make sure general wagner understands our priority is to maintain order in the streets.

37:33.250 --> 37:36.540
The people need to see that their country's being governed under the rule of law.

37:36.540 --> 37:40.330
What happens when matobo's men execute general juma without a trial?

37:40.330 --> 37:43.580
Should we intervene or let the mob tear them apart?

37:44.790 --> 37:48.180
I'm meeting with mr. Matobo in a few minutes.

37:48.180 --> 37:51.530
I'll make sure he keeps his men in line.

37:51.530 --> 37:55.820
And,joe,I was wrong to dress you down in front of the joint chiefs.

37:55.820 --> 37:56.840
I'm sorry.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.650
No need to apologize,madame president.

37:58.650 --> 37:59.590
You're under a lot of pressure.

37:59.590 --> 38:01.710
That's still no excuse.

38:01.710 --> 38:04.400
Thank yo ma'am,I appreciate that.

38:04.750 --> 38:08.770
The fact remains,if you can't get behind this operation with both shoulders,

38:08.770 --> 38:11.970
I will need your resignation.

38:11.970 --> 38:13.700
That won't be necessary,ma'am.

38:13.700 --> 38:16.940
Whatever doubts I have,I'll keep them to myself.

38:16.940 --> 38:18.080
Good.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.830
Excuse me,madame president.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.030
What is it,ethan?

38:21.030 --> 38:26.640
I thought you'd want to know,henry aldrich has agreed to delay his broadcast for 24 hours.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.850
Henry's doing?

38:28.850 --> 38:30.470
I,uh,underestimated him.

38:30.470 --> 38:32.590
Letting him intervene was the right call.

38:32.590 --> 38:34.250
Well,that's some good news.

38:34.250 --> 38:35.980
What about the firewall situation?

38:35.980 --> 38:37.560
Has the fbi made any progress?

38:37.560 --> 38:40.070
They've identified a man who may have information.

38:40.070 --> 38:42.750
They're about to question him.

38:46.500 --> 38:50.410
It's more than likely schector's not going to give you this information easily.

38:51.230 --> 38:53.040
Just remember,this is an fbi operation.

38:53.040 --> 38:56.150
We work within the confines of the law.

38:56.150 --> 38:58.330
You can threaten him,but do not lay hands on him.

38:58.330 --> 39:01.690
The minute I see you crossing that line,I will pull you back,understood?

39:01.690 --> 39:03.790
Understood.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.480
Agent walker,fbi.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.280
I'm here to talk to gabriel schector.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.940
Just a second.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.600
Can I help you?

39:31.720 --> 39:33.570
Jack bauer?

39:33.570 --> 39:35.180
How are you,gabe?

39:35.180 --> 39:37.110
Didn't know you were fbi.

39:37.110 --> 39:38.890
I'm not.

39:38.890 --> 39:40.710
Just came along for the ride.

39:40.710 --> 39:42.460
Mr. Bauer is here under my authority.

39:42.460 --> 39:48.090
Oh,so I can hold you responsible for anything he does while he's here.

39:48.090 --> 39:50.130
I have a witness.

39:50.130 --> 39:51.890
Sure.

39:53.550 --> 39:55.090
Okay.

39:55.090 --> 39:57.240
Come on in.

40:00.870 --> 40:02.640
Please.

40:03.070 --> 40:05.060
Have a seat.

40:11.820 --> 40:14.430
this should be an interesting conversation.

40:14.430 --> 40:15.980
How long's it been,jack?

40:15.980 --> 40:17.830
Years.

40:17.830 --> 40:19.140
How's the,uh...

40:19.140 --> 40:21.770
senate thing doing?

40:21.770 --> 40:24.480
I hear they dismantled the ctu.

40:24.480 --> 40:26.230
Don't tell me.

40:26.230 --> 40:28.140
It was your fault,wasn't it?

40:28.140 --> 40:30.490
Mr. Schector,we're not here to make small talk.

40:30.490 --> 40:31.710
I have questions.

40:31.710 --> 40:34.400
Well,you have my undivided attention.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.980
Where's tony almeida?

40:35.980 --> 40:37.910
Tony almeida?

40:37.910 --> 40:39.830
In the ground,I spose.

40:39.830 --> 40:42.280
Unless he was cremated.

40:42.280 --> 40:45.370
Didn't he die at ctu a while back?

40:45.370 --> 40:47.670
You got an out here,gabe.

40:47.670 --> 40:49.710
They're not after you.

40:49.710 --> 40:51.150
They're willing to accept that you didn't know

40:51.150 --> 40:55.220
what tony almeidaas going to do with the components that y helped him steal.

40:58.860 --> 41:04.170
Nobody I knew stole anything,and if they did,I knew nothing about it.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.940
This is far more serious than you know,mr. Schector.

41:06.940 --> 41:10.020
If you help us find almeida,I can see to it that you're kept in the clear.

41:10.020 --> 41:15.170
Otherwise,you could be a co-conspirator to multiple terrorist acts.

41:15.640 --> 41:19.660
No,well,I think this conversation is over.

41:19.660 --> 41:23.020
I tried to answer all your questions honestly,

41:23.020 --> 41:26.540
but I think,from now on,you can speak to my lawyers.

41:26.540 --> 41:29.000
So,good-bye,jack.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.350
And good luck with the senate.

41:30.350 --> 41:32.090
Hope they fry your ass.

41:32.090 --> 41:35.570
Ari,could you show these people to the door,please.

41:35.570 --> 41:36.990
Are you sure you want to play it like this?

41:36.990 --> 41:39.630
Yeah,that's the way I want to play,jack.

41:44.110 --> 41:45.590
-Drop your weapon.
-Drop it now!

41:45.590 --> 41:48.270
Okay,okay,okay.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.440
You two are going to prison!

41:50.440 --> 41:51.750
This was unprovoked!

41:51.750 --> 41:52.630
Unprovoked!

41:52.630 --> 41:57.020
Your man ari was going for his gun-- I've got a witness.

41:57.790 --> 42:00.760
Why don't we try having this conversation again.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.400
Where is tony almeida?

42:02.400 --> 42:03.420
No.

42:03.420 --> 42:06.010
I'm not talking to you.

42:07.840 --> 42:10.490
Where is he?

42:10.490 --> 42:13.240
Tony almeida's dead.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.910
What do you want me to do?

42:17.450 --> 42:20.490
This is your call.

42:21.030 --> 42:23.910
Do whatever it takes.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.800
This is against the law.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.330
You can't do this.

42:28.330 --> 42:30.010
I'm gonna enjoy this.

42:30.010 --> 42:31.860
Enjoy what?

42:34.600 --> 42:36.280
All right,all right!

42:36.280 --> 42:38.980
I'll tell you what I know!

42:39.960 --> 42:44.380
There's no need for me to lose my good looks over this.

42:44.380 --> 42:45.930
okay.

42:45.930 --> 42:48.350
Last time I saw almeida...

42:56.130 --> 42:57.010
are you all right?

42:57.010 --> 42:58.090
Yeah.

43:00.340 --> 43:03.500
Tell your men they've got a shooter on top of the columbia building,heading south.

43:03.500 --> 43:05.250
Shots fired.Suspects are down.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.600
The shooter's on the roof of the columbia building across the street.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.810
Seal all exits.

43:17.230 --> 43:19.080
Get away from this,jack.

43:19.080 --> 43:20.430
Tony?

43:20.430 --> 43:23.380
There's nothing you or the fbi can do about this.

43:23.380 --> 43:24.490
Just stay away.

43:24.490 --> 43:26.340
Tony,just talk to me.

43:26.340 --> 43:27.960
What the hell's going...

43:27.960 --> 43:29.490
tony...

43:29.490 --> 43:31.380
tony!

43:42.180 --> 43:43.820
What's going on at schector's office?

43:43.820 --> 43:46.380
I don't know.They haven't checked in yet.

43:51.670 --> 43:56.420
Gsa 117,northeast three,descend pilot's discretion,direct jfk.

43:56.420 --> 43:59.790
Northeast three,roger,we're starting our descent now.

44:00.370 --> 44:05.760
Gsa 117,descend and maintain 2,000,expect holding runway four-right.

44:08.600 --> 44:10.870
Gsa 117,I did not receive your read-back.

44:10.870 --> 44:13.660
Acknowledge.Over.

44:15.010 --> 44:18.110
Gsa 117,acknowledge.

44:22.580 --> 44:26.190
Mr. Paulson,I've lost comm with gsa 117.

44:27.240 --> 44:28.720
Try the emergency channels.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.600
I did.

44:31.340 --> 44:33.190
Nothing.

44:33.190 --> 44:34.210
And there's no fault on my board.

44:34.210 --> 44:36.660
I redirected twice.

44:37.580 --> 44:40.660
Something's interfering with our comm.

44:41.800 --> 44:43.010
Call back fbi!

44:43.010 --> 44:46.820
Tell them we have a 767 on approach no longer under our control!

44:46.820 --> 44:50.320
Gsa 117,acknowledge.

44:50.320 --> 44:52.930
Gsa 117,this is northeast three.

44:52.930 --> 44:55.040
Go ahead,air traffic control.

44:55.040 --> 44:59.160
Advise passing 7,000,maintain 1,500.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.430
Traffic ahead reporting moderate turbulence.

45:01.430 --> 45:03.670
Should be a smoother ride for you down there.

45:03.670 --> 45:05.500
Roger that,northeast three.

45:05.500 --> 45:08.380
Understand,northeast three,gsa 117.

45:08.380 --> 45:11.060
Enter descent for 1,500.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.120
All right.

45:16.120 --> 45:18.990
Get ready to make the course change.

45:21.010 --> 45:24.270
We're really taking this all the way.

45:24.650 --> 45:27.390
You just need to do exactly what I tell you to do.
