WEBVTT

00:28.153 --> 00:29.738
You know, you a pretty boy.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.031
Uh-oh. There he go.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.117
There he go with that.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.578
Baby Jesus. He's bouncing on us.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.455
I'm taking off on you folks.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.041
I already got a job
waiting on me on the outside.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.834
Get out of here
and stay out of here, Boo.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.629
Gotta meet each other outside,
stop meeting up in here.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.672
Yeah.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.175
I can't mess up again.

00:50.259 --> 00:53.262
Because, if I mess up one more time,

00:54.221 --> 00:56.765
No parole, and it's ten years prison time.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.933
The most emotional part
of this job is seeing

01:40.017 --> 01:42.561
the young seventeen-year-olds coming
into jail.

01:54.906 --> 01:57.826
The first day
I walked into admissions, I was scared.

01:57.909 --> 02:00.912
It smelled like depression, anxiety.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.582
It felt like a bad dream.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.668
I look at this
as an experience, because I am young.

02:06.752 --> 02:09.963
I have life ahead of me
and I don't want to keep coming back here.

02:10.547 --> 02:14.092
It's difficult to see some of the young
adults come into our facility,

02:14.176 --> 02:17.429
knowing that there's a potential
for a wasted life.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.806
It really make you lose yourself.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.391
It seem like time is nothing.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.491
I'll have you all stand up
and walk down the hallway.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.285
This is my first time
being in Gwinnett County jail.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.497
'Cause all my other charges have been
juvenile.

02:51.963 --> 02:55.425
It's my first time
getting locked up for...

02:55.509 --> 02:57.803
- Like...
- Some serious shit?

02:57.886 --> 03:01.223
Nah, nah. This is my first adult charge,

03:01.306 --> 03:03.892
I had just got my probation exterminated

03:03.975 --> 03:05.435
for juvenile, that's it.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.979
So this the first time
I've been in County.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.399
Oh, okay. From a jouvey.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.317
Where they pick you up at?

03:12.401 --> 03:16.113
I don't even know, nigga. We was just...
I was riding back from the mall,

03:16.488 --> 03:19.199
and they get me, my girl, her sister,

03:19.324 --> 03:23.829
one of my niggas... We was smokin'
and threw the blunt out the window.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.206
Talking about, we see "twelve" behind us,

03:26.456 --> 03:28.959
"put the strap in the trunk,
put the clip in the trunk

03:29.376 --> 03:32.129
put all the zans in the trunk,
all the weed in the trunk."

03:32.421 --> 03:34.047
They pulled us over for the bumper.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.717
They found one .380 bullet laying
on the floor.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.219
And they was like,
"Oh, we're searching through everything."

03:39.302 --> 03:42.723
Nigga, they lifted up...
or they popped the back seats open,

03:42.806 --> 03:45.600
and then they popped the trunk,
and they just found all that shit.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.686
And then they were trying
to arrest all four of us,

03:47.769 --> 03:51.523
and I wasn't finna let my girl
and my nigga go to jail for some bullshit.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.442
So I was like, "This is mine."

03:55.777 --> 03:57.529
I sat here and rode around with

03:57.612 --> 03:59.990
14 zans and a gun on me,

04:00.157 --> 04:03.952
and got pulled over,
and decided to take the charge to myself.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.370
Well, of course I'm gonna do that,

04:05.454 --> 04:07.831
because I'm not gonna let
someone else take the charge for me.

04:07.914 --> 04:08.999
That's not what I do.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.378
That's some G shit, I will say that.
That's some G shit.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.675
I'm just saying
that's some real shit, bro!

04:27.517 --> 04:29.728
- You going home tomorrow night?
- Tonight.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.980
Is that right? Congratulations.

04:32.063 --> 04:32.981
Thank you!

04:34.274 --> 04:36.109
Done with it once and for all!

04:36.193 --> 04:38.612
My name is Amy Middlebrooks.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.656
I'm 54 years old
and I live in Athens, Georgia.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.575
I'm going home tonight.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.369
I live with my son and his girlfriend,

04:46.453 --> 04:48.580
and we got a couple of roommates,
and my husband.

04:48.663 --> 04:52.042
And then my daughter lives in Snellville
and I'll stay with her off and on

04:52.125 --> 04:54.252
to help her babysit when she goes to work.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.213
Do your best to stay out of here.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.924
Oh, yeah.
It's all done and over with now.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.426
Can you tell me
how you ended up here?

05:01.635 --> 05:04.679
Well... That's kind of tricky. Um...

05:04.763 --> 05:07.307
I got a speeding ticket...

05:08.600 --> 05:10.477
a year ago, January.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.522
1st court date and our car broke down.

05:13.605 --> 05:17.901
My second court date, my car ran 48 hours
and it broke down again.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.402
So they put me on probation.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.572
23 hours of community service.
We didn't get the paperwork right away.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.283
The woman wasn't really
affiliated with them.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.202
In August, my son bought a car.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.704
The tag was expired,
got pulled over for the expired tags.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.957
Found out my license was expired...

05:32.040 --> 05:35.043
Then, our roommate's car broke down...
So that left us with...

05:35.126 --> 05:36.878
...take the 30 days...

05:37.420 --> 05:41.174
So, the judge ordered me to do 30 days,

05:41.258 --> 05:44.427
and I done 15 because you get two for one.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.264
So that's why I'm sitting here.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.561
You come across the other Joker,
just pull it out.

05:53.270 --> 05:57.607
For me, jail was scary to start with.
It's all in how you look at it.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.860
Oh my gosh!

06:00.277 --> 06:04.322
I look at it like it's a little vacation
away from all the drama on the outside.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.243
That's my little getaway, and...

06:09.369 --> 06:10.537
You won!

06:10.620 --> 06:13.206
- Thought I didn't have 8. I did, though!
- Shit!

06:18.712 --> 06:21.339
My husband, he'll be glad
when he sees me, but...

06:21.673 --> 06:23.925
I can't say I'm all that glad to see him.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.013
You know, I do need my peace
once in a while, just to keep

06:28.305 --> 06:29.347
a strong mind.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.204
- Hey, hey! Listen, now.
- Oh, we're sweet!

06:57.500 --> 06:58.335
Real shit, tho.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.505
When a wolf smile,

07:02.923 --> 07:04.591
you see his teeth, don't you?

07:05.508 --> 07:08.845
So that let you know that...
that the instinct is in him.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.097
If you push him in a corner,

07:11.723 --> 07:12.974
what his he gonna do?

07:14.017 --> 07:15.101
He gonna bite.

07:16.144 --> 07:19.356
And I was put in that corner.
And when you living that lifestyle,

07:20.649 --> 07:23.276
you have to be all the way real
with that shit.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.611
You can't have no heart.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.906
'Cause if you have heart,
love will get you killed.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.159
Hey, we been... we want a purge, man.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.954
We want a purge.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.129
This is my first day here.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.006
for violating my parole.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.764
I did ten years
at the Alabama Correctional Facility.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.891
I left Birmingham, Alabama

07:54.975 --> 07:57.894
without really telling my parole officer.

07:57.978 --> 08:02.440
You don't supposed to leave the state
without you being off of parole,

08:02.524 --> 08:05.485
or getting permission
from your parole officer.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.948
Didn't know I had no warrant on me,
for this shit.

08:10.031 --> 08:13.660
So the police jumped down on us,
you know, standing on the block, you know.

08:13.743 --> 08:14.744
In front of the store.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.414
And, uh, the police jump down
and ran my name,

08:17.497 --> 08:19.332
and it said I had a holding warrant.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.254
- Mayweather, Miller.
- Yeah.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.967
If you're in jail
at the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Office,

08:29.050 --> 08:32.303
and you have a hold for another state
for a parole violation,

08:32.846 --> 08:35.265
then you would be charged
as a fugitive from justice.

08:36.224 --> 08:39.769
The state that has the warrant on them
is responsible for providing a transport

08:39.852 --> 08:42.188
to bring that person back
to the other state.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.650
Generally, it's around 14 to 20 days

08:45.734 --> 08:47.652
they are awaiting transport
to the other state.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.450
I had to leave Alabama.

08:53.742 --> 08:57.120
'Cause I know if I would have stayed
in Alabama, I would've had to carry a gun.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.413
You see what I'm saying?

08:58.496 --> 09:01.207
'Cause once you're a gangster,
a gangster always carry a gun.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.128
I don't even think
that I might live to see 40

09:05.670 --> 09:07.255
when I go back to Alabama, man.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.635
All right, step in, face the back.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.804
Hold your bits above your head
if you have to.

09:22.604 --> 09:25.607
When I walk out, the first thing
that come to my mind is "don't come back."

09:26.316 --> 09:30.445
And I'm gonna change my group of people,
my friends, sorry to say to y'all.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.821
Yes, I'm changing y'all.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.908
Biggest thing for me is getting
to hug and kiss both of my kids

09:34.991 --> 09:37.827
and tell them that I love them
and that Daddy's not going anywhere.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.080
This is not a place for me, so yeah,

09:40.163 --> 09:42.540
this is this is my last rodeo right here.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.219
Can't wait to be free.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.638
It's like one mistake can mess you
all up.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.936
The first time I got caught,
it was possession marijuana.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.856
Second time it was possession
of a controlled substance.

10:06.940 --> 10:07.941
It was a felony.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.568
They gave me
three years' probation for that.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.571
I just been in and out after that.

10:14.197 --> 10:17.200
Once they get you once,
it's just like a yo-yo effect.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.910
It'll come back and get you.

10:21.412 --> 10:24.332
This is my last chance
because if I get busted again,

10:24.415 --> 10:27.460
I could go to prison and do,
probably up to ten years for...

10:27.919 --> 10:29.295
for the charge that I have.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.049
Some inmates here get probation.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.594
It could be from several months
to several years on probation.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.513
They have guidelines they have to sign.

10:38.596 --> 10:42.517
to say that "I agree that I'll go
by the terms of this probation."

10:42.600 --> 10:45.019
And if not, I can be put back in jail

10:45.103 --> 10:47.564
for the full term
of that original probation.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.404
I was doing good
in school with freshman,

10:54.487 --> 10:56.489
sophomore, junior year,

10:56.573 --> 11:00.618
doing my best I can.
And then senior year comes and...

11:00.702 --> 11:03.580
started doing weed. And...

11:04.747 --> 11:06.207
fell in with the wrong crowd.

11:06.833 --> 11:10.587
You start following their ways,
using drugs and stuff like that.

11:11.087 --> 11:14.090
A lot of people get away with it,
so, like, why don't I do it?

11:16.217 --> 11:19.512
The main fear I have right now
is going back to jail.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.849
Every day I think about that,
and it's scary.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.816
Last name Chambers?

11:33.860 --> 11:35.737
I need to stand in that yellow box, okay?

11:36.154 --> 11:38.156
Let me have your full name
and your birthday.

11:38.239 --> 11:41.826
- Jeffrey Daniel Chambers, 12/08/99.
- Okay.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.209
<i>Okay.
These are your charges, okay?</i>

11:50.376 --> 11:53.838
<i>You have a bond of $3,250, okay?</i>

11:54.839 --> 11:56.424
I gotta pay all that in cash?

11:56.507 --> 12:00.386
If you was to pay physical cash. If not,
can't come up with that whole amount,

12:00.470 --> 12:03.514
you could have a friend
or family member go to a bonding agency,

12:03.598 --> 12:05.850
12 to 50%, that's what they'll charge.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.895
Once you get to the room with the phones,
you can call and get a rate.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.939
So, where do I go?
I go to number 9 right now?

12:11.022 --> 12:13.274
Go all the way around,
go inside door number 8.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.568
It's open for you, okay?
Close the door behind you.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.653
Yes, ma'am.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.282
Hey, how you do this? How you do it?
How you do this?

12:21.908 --> 12:24.410
Press one. One again,

12:25.328 --> 12:26.871
and then you type your number.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.540
<i>Hello. This is a free call from...</i>

12:29.916 --> 12:31.042
<i>Jeffrey.</i>

12:31.125 --> 12:34.212
<i>...an inmate
at Gwinnett County Sheriff's Department.</i>

12:34.963 --> 12:37.257
- <i>Yeah, baby.
- Mama.</i>

12:37.715 --> 12:40.385
$3,250.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.554
<i>$3,250.</i>

12:43.972 --> 12:48.518
<i>But for bail, you only gotta pay 15%,
so I just gotta find a bailsman.</i>

12:48.601 --> 12:52.105
Do you need some bond people numbers?
They on the TV right here.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.901
<i>No, no, honey.
They're all up and down 20 right there.</i>

12:56.985 --> 13:00.405
I know, there's one across the street.
You finna come...

13:01.114 --> 13:01.990
in a little bit?

13:02.073 --> 13:04.575
<i>Okay,
first of all, I got to wake up first.</i>

13:04.826 --> 13:07.745
Man, I'm saying,
I don't care what time you come,

13:07.829 --> 13:10.581
just come bail a young nigga out of jail.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.669
<i>Okay. Let me ask you,
where's the money you have?</i>

13:15.712 --> 13:16.713
<i>In my wallet.</i>

13:17.297 --> 13:20.008
<i>Okay. All right.
We're working on it, son.</i>

13:22.969 --> 13:24.721
Well, I see my mom probably, like,

13:25.513 --> 13:26.723
once every...

13:27.348 --> 13:28.224
two weeks.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.268
We used to fight all the time.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.229
And then, I'd just, like, never come home,

13:33.313 --> 13:36.190
and that's when really I started...
started doing bad stuff.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.527
And everybody in my family
always downs me.

13:40.486 --> 13:44.073
Always thinks of me as the negative one,
not the positive one.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.200
And they always put me down and...

13:46.826 --> 13:51.039
But I can't say shit, really,
'cause look where I'm at. I'm in jail.

13:52.874 --> 13:53.708
I mean,

13:54.417 --> 13:57.378
me and my mom still got good,
good relationship,

13:57.795 --> 14:00.089
I mean,
or she wouldn't be coming tomorrow.

14:00.631 --> 14:01.674
Or today.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.093
But, I mean...

14:05.386 --> 14:06.763
it is what it is.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.571
So, what are you gonna do
when you get out?

14:24.697 --> 14:25.948
I'm going home.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.368
I'm going to my daughter's.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.203
Then your daughter's
gonna come get you?

14:30.286 --> 14:32.872
Yeah, her and Killian and Brett.

14:32.955 --> 14:33.790
Oh, so...

14:33.873 --> 14:35.583
They have to wait
until Brett gets off work.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.168
'Cause Jessica can't drive.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.756
My family relies on me for help

14:41.839 --> 14:44.384
'cause they all know I'll help them
any way they need.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.179
My kids come to me about anything.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.639
and I do mean anything.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.850
My husband can't function without me.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.018
I don't know what it is.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.272
Been married 26 years,
and he's always been like that.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.068
They've got to learn on their own.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.780
- Killian is gonna be excited.
- Oh, yeah, he loves his nana.

15:05.863 --> 15:10.034
- Your husband will be glad, too.
- I ain't going home to see him yet!

15:10.618 --> 15:13.371
He won't even know I'm out
until probably Monday.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.290
So it's kind of like a vacation
away from him.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.762
What's gonna happen now,

15:29.846 --> 15:32.473
I will send y'all to my workers,
I will give you all a room,

15:32.557 --> 15:34.684
you're gonna put whatever things
you have in your room,

15:34.767 --> 15:36.853
come to the room,
and have a seat back right here.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.396
Classifications is on their way up.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.527
Merriweather, 306-B.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.028
- Edgar Miller.
- Yeah.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.531
Maboso, 308-B.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.658
Nugent, 309-B.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.536
- You're the first seat, here.
- Okay.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.916
I'm from Alabama and shit. I'm waiting
on Alabama police come and get me.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.918
Fugitive warrant,
you know what I'm saying?

16:01.002 --> 16:02.837
That parole violation shit.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.632
They might not come get you.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.554
They gotta contact Alabama,
let them know they got you in custody.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.764
They might not fuck with you.

16:15.683 --> 16:16.767
Fuck, man.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.898
I realized, man, I had to, you know,
get the fuck on, you know I'm saying?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.983
Get away from Birmingham, Alabama.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.862
They tried to kill me down there
in Alabama, man.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.951
There's a lot of shit that I won't
talk about, Imma take to my grave.

16:35.870 --> 16:38.164
Somebody might got a hit out on me
right now.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.959
But I just pray and hope
that I don't get killed when I go back.

16:43.794 --> 16:48.674
When looking
at individuals who are older,

16:48.758 --> 16:50.927
who've committed serious crimes,

16:51.260 --> 16:53.888
and then dealing with individuals who...

16:54.138 --> 16:58.142
come in at a young age
and have committed serious crimes,

16:58.309 --> 17:00.520
sometimes you do look at it and go,

17:00.853 --> 17:04.565
Wow. This kid is following
in the same footsteps,

17:04.648 --> 17:06.025
and this could be your future.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.570
I used
to get in the mirror and shit,

17:10.655 --> 17:12.990
and used to be, you know, fantasizing,

17:13.241 --> 17:16.117
you know, with a gun,
looking at myself with a gun, like...

17:16.618 --> 17:19.622
you know, and it made me feel big,
you know what I'm saying?

17:19.704 --> 17:21.624
My earliest experience
with a gun

17:21.707 --> 17:24.794
was probably when I was, like, 14.

17:26.253 --> 17:29.757
It was at the age, 11, 12, hanging out
with the big boys and shit.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.134
It was all about the gun.
Gun was like power.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.470
And respect, you know what I'm saying?

17:36.889 --> 17:39.225
I like
the adrenaline rush of it.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.102
It's kind of weird to say,

17:41.185 --> 17:43.521
but I like the sound of gunshots.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.149
And that's when I diverted over
to gangbanging.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.235
And we went on robbery sprees and shit.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.862
And I used to be the one
that used to want to shoot a motherfucker.

17:51.946 --> 17:55.199
If someone's shooting at me,
I'm... "Whoa!"

17:55.283 --> 17:58.035
And if I have a gun, of course
I'm gonna shoot back, I mean...

17:58.327 --> 17:59.453
That's what I know.

18:03.749 --> 18:06.335
At the age of 13 I had killed somebody.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.129
I killed my first person.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.131
And it felt good,

18:11.007 --> 18:15.094
because I feel like if I didn't do it,
he was gonna kill my uncle.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.679
My mama's brother.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.309
I took a life! You know, and...

18:21.642 --> 18:23.269
people never forget that shit.

18:36.282 --> 18:40.244
Let me see.
Damn! What'd you do, son?

18:40.328 --> 18:45.166
Yeah, I got caught
with a strap and about 15 zans and shit.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.585
Oh, damn.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.463
- They trying to fry a young G...
- At least you got a bond.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.381
Hell, yeah,
that's all I'm saying.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.426
Shit,
you probably gotta pay 15% of that shit.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.137
I don't even know
how much that's gonna be.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.848
I don't know either.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.142
You gotta do the math on that one,
my brother.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.943
You may start conversation now.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.236
<i>Hello?</i>

19:14.528 --> 19:16.072
<i>Hey, look at your paperwork.</i>

19:16.614 --> 19:17.448
<i>Why?</i>

19:18.157 --> 19:20.159
<i>It should show you the...</i>

19:20.910 --> 19:24.622
<i>price of the actual chart,
and where it says "bond amount."</i>

19:25.289 --> 19:28.668
<i>My total bond amount is $3,250.</i>

19:29.043 --> 19:32.213
<i>We have to pay 15% of it. That's $350.</i>

19:32.505 --> 19:33.756
<i>Are you sure?</i>

19:34.465 --> 19:38.219
<i>Mother, the bond amount
is 15% of your total bond amount.</i>

19:39.178 --> 19:42.765
<i>And you talked with somebody?
And that's what they said?</i>

19:43.432 --> 19:46.602
<i>Oh, my God. Come up here,
and come to the jail and...</i>

19:47.311 --> 19:48.145
<i>Nigga bring...</i>

19:48.562 --> 19:51.107
<i>I cannot physically drive up
to the fucking jail.</i>

19:51.190 --> 19:52.566
<i>Don't you understand that?</i>

19:53.859 --> 19:55.236
<i>Fine. Bye.</i>

20:01.951 --> 20:03.994
<i>My bond is $3,000, so...</i>

20:05.079 --> 20:08.457
It's really only15%,
but she's not getting that.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.752
And then she's not always...

20:11.961 --> 20:15.172
like, able to drive,
she's like, handicapped.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.302
I mean, she said she was gonna try,

20:20.720 --> 20:25.015
but I don't think she's gonna try,
I don't think she finna come get me.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.655
<i>Fifteen more minutes, guys.</i>

20:42.450 --> 20:45.453
- What you doing? Getting ready?
- We straight. How long you gonna be out?

20:45.536 --> 20:48.330
- The 18th. This July.
- The 18th of next month?

20:49.415 --> 20:52.835
When I get out,
well, seeing my family

20:52.918 --> 20:54.712
it's gonna be scary.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.589
Before coming in here,

20:56.714 --> 20:59.967
I felt like me and my family
weren't in a good relationship.

21:00.259 --> 21:04.388
I've said things to my parents
that I wish I could take back.

21:05.556 --> 21:09.059
Everything I do it just, like,
brings up questions.

21:09.143 --> 21:10.936
Kicked me out a couple times.

21:11.145 --> 21:15.483
It got to the point where I wouldn't tell
my parents about anything anymore,

21:15.900 --> 21:19.403
because they said they didn't have
trust in me. So I felt like...

21:20.196 --> 21:23.449
you know what I'm saying, let me just do
everything behind their back.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.244
Be good, buddy. No dumbass decisions.

21:28.037 --> 21:31.624
Sometimes, in here,
I talk to my mom on the phone.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.877
I could always hear it in her voice, too.
When she talks to me.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.879
I could just hear her, sad.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.800
And it's not like they they set
a bad example for us, it's just...

21:41.008 --> 21:43.219
sometimes you fall in
with the wrong crowd.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.180
And you go down the wrong path.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.520
I want to get out and show my parents

21:52.603 --> 21:55.856
that I can do it
and I'm not just another statistic.

21:56.732 --> 21:59.235
I hope I get a move on with my life.

21:59.944 --> 22:03.155
- Be safe and don't come back, man.
- Not planning on it.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.179
It's not as bad as what they think.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.641
The first five days,
I had a room to myself.

22:31.267 --> 22:34.144
I just done went back and had
my little vacation in the jail

22:34.228 --> 22:35.479
'cause it's nice and quiet.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.149
If I violate my probation again,

22:39.233 --> 22:41.068
it's over with for me.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.697
They could even take me to jail
if I ran a stop light.

22:45.489 --> 22:49.034
I can't wait to go home
and see my little grandson, Killian.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.662
He is six and I know he's missing me.

22:52.538 --> 22:56.542
Right now I just want to work
until I can save up enough money

22:56.625 --> 22:58.168
to be able to go to college.

23:01.005 --> 23:03.507
And once you get dressed,
I'll give you the rest of your property.

23:03.591 --> 23:04.425
Okay.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.386
Don't forget your paper, man.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.688
I really miss my family.
My sister is 21.

23:17.813 --> 23:21.275
She loves me. And I've gotten so close
with my older brother.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.028
I'm actually really excited
for them to come.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.364
- There you go. Good luck.
- Oh, yeah.

23:28.115 --> 23:31.160
Still gonna take a little vacation
from my husband and them till Monday

23:31.243 --> 23:32.369
before I let them know.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.291
Breath the free air!

23:46.425 --> 23:48.010
- That's your brother?
- Yeah.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.600
Oh!

23:56.393 --> 23:57.519
What's up?

23:58.729 --> 24:02.107
- You're so black!
- I'm so black?

24:02.983 --> 24:03.901
What's up?

24:05.319 --> 24:06.904
How long was that, five months?

24:06.987 --> 24:09.198
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Goddamn.

24:15.162 --> 24:15.996
Yes, ma'am.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.582
I've got a question.
Do you have a phone I can use?

24:19.750 --> 24:21.251
- Local number?
- Yeah.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.220
Okay. He's already at work.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.764
Can you try
another number for me, please?

24:39.478 --> 24:41.939
Must be on the way to work.
All right, thank you.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.795
Gentlemen, let's have a seat.
Let's make this fast, quick.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.844
I'm ready
to get this shit over with, man.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.972
You know? So I can move on
with my life to the next step.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.976
Deputy Mulkey
and Deputy Smith from Classifications.

25:19.059 --> 25:22.354
Classification is kind of like
the heartbeat of the jail.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.399
Our job today is to classify you
and get you out of here.

25:25.482 --> 25:28.193
We classify them
as far as their security level,

25:28.277 --> 25:30.279
between minimum, medium, and max,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.573
and that depends where they can live here.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.159
And we kind of segregate them
as best we can.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.661
We don't want to put a minimum
with the max.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.832
- What's your first name?
- Edgar.

25:41.915 --> 25:45.794
An inmate who would be classified as a max
is gonna have the aggravated assaults,

25:45.878 --> 25:49.214
aggrivated batteries, the armed robberies.

25:49.590 --> 25:52.342
We got an obstruction charge back in 1999,

25:52.468 --> 25:55.054
possession of a firearm, robbery in 2001.

25:55.304 --> 25:56.889
You were on parole before for robbery.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.724
- The second.
- Yes.

25:59.349 --> 26:02.311
And I had stopped going,
so I violated my parole,

26:02.394 --> 26:04.063
but I didn't catch no other case.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.191
They are gonna try
to manipulate the system.

26:07.274 --> 26:10.486
They know what we're looking for
and they will try to lie.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.030
You ever been in any type of gang?

26:13.864 --> 26:15.365
- No.
- No gang?

26:19.995 --> 26:22.372
There's probably
half the population

26:22.623 --> 26:26.001
in this facility that is affiliated
with some type of gang.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.463
We want to take pictures
of everybody's tattoos

26:29.546 --> 26:32.549
because we want to identify
as many gang members as we can.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.969
And second, we take pictures
for documentation purposes.

26:36.053 --> 26:38.013
So if PD is looking for a person,

26:38.597 --> 26:42.267
and the victim only can identify a tattoo,
then that's a quick identifier.

26:42.351 --> 26:43.936
Gentlemen, take your shirt off.

26:45.187 --> 26:48.565
Identifying the gang members
is the biggest challenge, for sure.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.692
I would not like to put

26:50.776 --> 26:52.986
70 Blood gang members all in one unit.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.239
I would like to spread them out
throughout the jail.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.118
If they're getting numbers,
they have power,

26:59.201 --> 27:00.911
and then they extort the other inmates.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.588
- What happened to you, man?
<i>- </i> Got shot.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.299
- Where at?
<i>- </i> Birmingham, Alabama.

27:26.937 --> 27:29.857
Sometimes these guys are brought
into the gang at teenage years,

27:29.940 --> 27:31.441
when they're really impressionable.

27:31.525 --> 27:33.402
It's the cool thing to do
when you're young,

27:33.485 --> 27:35.279
but once they get older,

27:35.362 --> 27:37.531
they realize it's not all
it's cracked up to be.

27:38.824 --> 27:41.118
I'm 39 years old now,

27:41.535 --> 27:44.663
and it took for me to go
through all this tragedy in my life

27:45.330 --> 27:46.623
to realize that,

27:46.707 --> 27:48.625
hey, man, I got to make a change, man.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.336
Shit!

27:54.464 --> 27:56.466
I got a bullet in me. You understand?

27:59.845 --> 28:02.055
I came from Birmingham, Alabama

28:02.139 --> 28:05.601
with just a dream and $1,200
in my pocket. You know?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.731
I'm safe here, 'cause nobody know me,

28:10.814 --> 28:13.400
and I feel
like I still got another chance, man.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.417
I thought you'd get out.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.920
"Shit, my mama's not gonna pay my bond."

28:33.879 --> 28:35.756
I don't think
she's paying my shit.

28:35.839 --> 28:39.718
I think my nigga who, goddamn,
who was in the car, who was driving...

28:39.801 --> 28:41.637
- He's gonna pay your shit.
- Right.

28:43.347 --> 28:45.474
We want people to be able to bond out.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.643
Normally, after 48 hours,

28:47.726 --> 28:49.561
they'll go to general population.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.105
There's a sense of urgency
to want to get out,

28:52.189 --> 28:54.608
because you want to get back
to what's normal for you.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.778
No one wants to be dressed in
and go to general population,

28:57.861 --> 29:00.656
'cause now they feel like,
"I'm officially an inmate."

29:01.198 --> 29:05.118
As long as I have my street clothes on,
they still have this identity of...

29:05.202 --> 29:07.871
"Hey, I'm getting out.
I'm not staying long. I'm out of here.

29:07.955 --> 29:10.707
I'm not the property of Gwinnett County."

29:13.627 --> 29:16.171
I'm just trying
to get out of here.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.507
Probably call my friends to bail me out.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.093
- <i>Is that Jeffrey?
- Hey, bros!</i>

29:21.176 --> 29:23.637
- <i>Jeffrey, are you okay?
- I need some bail.</i>

29:23.720 --> 29:26.431
<i>No. Y'all niggas finna leave.</i>

29:26.515 --> 29:28.934
I don't care if you're sleepy or what.
You need to wake up.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.894
<i>Fucking Nico said
that he lost his bail money.</i>

29:30.978 --> 29:34.106
Okay, okay. I don't care.
Y'all need to get shit figured out.

29:36.775 --> 29:40.612
Whoa! I have a whole 'nother felony
because of you. The fuck is you saying?

29:40.696 --> 29:43.865
Come bail me out of jail.
The fuck am I supposed to do inside here?

29:43.949 --> 29:46.785
<i>I've never done this, Jeffrey.
I don't know shit about this.</i>

29:47.995 --> 29:51.123
Go get Nico, nigga, and come over here.

29:51.206 --> 29:54.001
<i>We gonna get you out, bro.
We gonna get you out.</i>

29:54.084 --> 29:54.918
All right.

29:59.923 --> 30:03.677
My brother's girlfriend is
talking about trying to get out of here.

30:04.469 --> 30:07.514
And then hopefully, my bail will be paid.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.239
It's a little cramped,
but no handcuffs.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.157
Oh, yeah.

30:26.992 --> 30:31.872
Transporting one female
from the county jail to Snellville.

30:34.750 --> 30:38.086
If a person is being released,
and if they don't have a ride,

30:38.503 --> 30:42.424
we have deputies that are here
that we can provide a courtesy ride.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.929
Oh, I'm happy.
I'm just real glad I'm going home.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.264
- Right here?
- Yep.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.100
Can't wait to see my grandson
and my daughter.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.437
- Hi.
- I'm not coming out.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.689
- You're coming in.
- Were you expecting her?

30:57.773 --> 30:59.441
- Yes.
- Long as you're good, I'm good.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.862
You come give Nana love!

31:03.945 --> 31:06.198
I didn't know
you were out of jail already!

31:06.281 --> 31:07.491
Yes, I am!

31:11.495 --> 31:13.288
All right, I’m gonna put you down.

31:14.498 --> 31:17.125
- I gotta go pee.
- Uh-oh. Go potty.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.127
Okay.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.463
What's for breakfast?

31:22.547 --> 31:25.258
What have you
been eating for breakfast?

31:25.342 --> 31:30.263
An egg patty with a sausage patty,
two pieces of bread, grits.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.224
And you know, I don't do grits.

31:32.641 --> 31:33.517
I know, Mama.

31:41.024 --> 31:43.944
When you don't have communication
with your parents, it just hurts.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.779
Nothing falls into place.

31:46.655 --> 31:49.199
See my mom, she knows everything.

31:50.075 --> 31:52.661
I just need to sit down, be humble.

31:54.037 --> 31:56.289
It's gonna be hard,
but I'll get through it.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.418
You want pancakes?

32:00.877 --> 32:03.630
I want to make my my little brothers
and sisters happy,

32:03.713 --> 32:06.508
and if we're not together, laughing and...

32:06.591 --> 32:08.385
sharing good times, then what is it?

32:10.637 --> 32:14.599
I'm happy now
because he's back and he's changed.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.231
This is my last chance
because if I get busted again,

32:21.314 --> 32:22.399
I could go to prison.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.197
The love of a mother
is always there for her children.

32:29.906 --> 32:32.367
I love you, baby.
I love you so much.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.453
I tell myself,

32:34.536 --> 32:36.955
"Don't go back.
Don't do the stupid things you did."

32:51.887 --> 32:52.721
Chambers.

32:56.183 --> 32:58.977
All right, you're gonna go
through that doorway right there.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.104
I don't know
what the end is gonna be,

33:01.188 --> 33:03.148
'cause I never know what I'm gonna do.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.692
I might just end up being stupid
one of these days

33:05.775 --> 33:07.777
and going back out there
and doing the same thing.

33:08.612 --> 33:11.323
Hopefully I can better myself as a person

33:11.781 --> 33:14.951
and do what I need to do
to support myself.

33:17.704 --> 33:22.000
I feel like all the shit
that I did it came back to me.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.002
To make me realize

33:24.544 --> 33:26.880
karma a motherfucker.

33:27.797 --> 33:30.717
You see what I'm saying?
What go around come around.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.302
What's happening?

33:34.137 --> 33:35.138
What's up?

33:35.514 --> 33:36.515
What's up, Boo?

33:36.723 --> 33:39.184
I don't fear no man,
I don't feel no girl.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.645
The only person
I fear in this world is God.

33:42.771 --> 33:47.275
If God feels like I should get hit
by a bullet today, then rest in peace.

33:48.235 --> 33:51.363
All I can do now
is just get closer to God

33:51.446 --> 33:54.324
while I'm here waiting on them
to come get me

33:55.033 --> 33:59.913
and continue thinking of goals
that I set for myself.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.498
Fresh out the box!

34:08.338 --> 34:10.172
I'm free! I'm free!

34:28.692 --> 34:31.777
Waiting on these folks to come come get me
from Alabama, man.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.822
Go on down, man and...

34:34.072 --> 34:35.156
You know what I'm saying?

34:50.630 --> 34:55.467
I just think it's weird
to have my mom going to jail, but...

34:55.760 --> 34:58.013
it's just one of things
that happen, I guess.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.931
No, I'm not going back to jail.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.392
Not anytime soon, if I can help it.

35:31.421 --> 35:32.964
I've been here three months,

35:33.423 --> 35:35.800
and I have court next Tuesday.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.511
I guess we'll see
what happens from there.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.348
I could have just not fell off track.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.683
Sometimes I think
I can get away with stuff,

35:43.767 --> 35:46.478
but it's like,
ah, it always comes back to haunt me.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.662
Don't come! You know what I'm saying?
Don't come here, man!

36:03.745 --> 36:05.121
This place is built to break you.

36:05.205 --> 36:07.874
If you go out and make the same choices
when you leave here,

36:07.957 --> 36:10.960
you're gonna be right back here
with no choices again.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.546
Don't keep coming back,
it gets worse every time.

36:13.630 --> 36:14.464
Yeah.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.883
Take it as a learning experience
and grow from it.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.691
Guess what,
a badass ain't nothing in this world.

36:32.774 --> 36:34.693
Be the good guy. Fuck the bad guy.

36:35.568 --> 36:38.530
You just have to keep telling yourself
that you will get through this,

36:38.613 --> 36:41.157
and that this is not the end.
This is the beginning,

36:41.241 --> 36:43.910
but it's really up to you
what you do when you get out.
