Hey.
Are you back already?

00:49.773 --> 00:52.638
Is that
your entire life?

00:52.742 --> 00:53.881
Disappointed?

00:53.984 --> 00:55.400
No, I'm impressed.

00:55.503 --> 00:57.402
Here I'm thinking you've
only got three outfits.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.922
I really appreciate you
letting me crash here

01:01.026 --> 01:02.338
while I figure
everything out.

01:02.441 --> 01:03.994
You can stay for as long
as you want.

01:04.098 --> 01:07.067
Connor?

01:07.170 --> 01:08.551
Diane.

01:08.654 --> 01:10.139
She wants to have lunch.

01:10.242 --> 01:13.176
Oh. That's nice.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.971
No, not nice.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.491
They're lilies,
they're the flower of death.

01:17.594 --> 01:20.942
I'm meeting up
with Toni today.

01:21.046 --> 01:23.497
And if she offers you a job,
you take it.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.603
You cannot turn your life
upside down because of a guy.

01:26.707 --> 01:29.019
I mean, I'm still launching
Connor By Tahlia tomorrow.

01:29.123 --> 01:31.677
Yeah, see, that's weird.No, it's not.

01:31.781 --> 01:33.162
I have been working
on this fragrance

01:33.265 --> 01:36.268
for months, and I'm not about
to abandon it.

01:36.372 --> 01:38.753
Well, at least think about
choosing a different name.

01:38.857 --> 01:41.894
Oh, how about
C By Tahlia.

01:54.079 --> 01:56.461
What do you think makes
a good captain?

01:56.564 --> 01:58.428
Accountability.

01:58.532 --> 02:01.638
You know, being there
for the boys.

02:01.742 --> 02:06.367
I always thought it was
about honor and respect.

02:06.471 --> 02:10.371
Two things you know
nothing about.

02:10.475 --> 02:11.993
Brian, mate --

02:12.097 --> 02:15.135
I took you into my home.

02:15.238 --> 02:18.207
I gave you
every opportunity.

02:18.310 --> 02:19.587
And I'm grateful.

02:19.691 --> 02:22.142
This is my family!

02:22.245 --> 02:24.247
My family.

02:24.351 --> 02:26.525
Why didn't you think
about that?

02:26.629 --> 02:27.871
Or this club?

02:27.975 --> 02:29.597
If you wanna drop me...

02:29.701 --> 02:32.117
I'm not gonna destroy everything
we've worked so hard for

02:32.221 --> 02:34.499
just to make yourself
feel better.

02:34.602 --> 02:37.053
Now, get the fuck
out of my sight!

02:49.169 --> 02:50.446
Alright.
We've got this.

02:50.549 --> 02:51.964
We go in, we drop the bomb,
we get out.

02:52.068 --> 02:53.414
Yeah.
Like fighter pilots.

02:53.518 --> 02:55.727
Exactly.

02:55.830 --> 02:58.350
Oh, hello, ladies.

02:58.454 --> 03:00.697
Hello.

03:00.801 --> 03:02.837
What's happened?I can't explain it.

03:02.941 --> 03:04.770
It was done before
I knew what was happening.

03:04.874 --> 03:08.671
Oh, my God!
He-hee!

03:08.774 --> 03:11.881
Oh! Can you believe this?

03:11.984 --> 03:13.503
This is my idea!

03:13.607 --> 03:14.987
I just -- I wanted to
have some fun.

03:15.091 --> 03:16.472
Yeah. I always thought
if we hung out more,

03:16.575 --> 03:19.268
we'd be like some kind
of kick-arse girl gang.

03:19.371 --> 03:23.203
Plus I noticed that you were
missing a queen today.

03:23.306 --> 03:24.583
Yeah.
Where is Kath?

03:24.687 --> 03:26.447
She's not coming.Maybe --

03:26.551 --> 03:28.104
Maybe we should wait for her.No.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.347
Well, she told me she was
going to be here.

03:29.450 --> 03:31.141
Well, she's not.Hmm.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.074
And...

03:33.178 --> 03:35.663
Paige and I have something
we'd like to tell you.

03:35.767 --> 03:37.562
Paige and Daniel
broke up.

03:37.665 --> 03:38.735
What?!

03:38.839 --> 03:40.806
Babe, are you okay?Oh, my God!

03:40.910 --> 03:44.845
No, wait. There's more.
Tahlia and Connor broke up, too.

03:44.948 --> 03:46.709
Okay. Cool.

03:46.812 --> 03:48.952
Guess we're all across
how you feel about that one.

03:49.056 --> 03:51.127
No, sweetheart, Tahls,
it's not like that.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.094
You and Connor had
a really tricky relationship.

03:53.198 --> 03:54.613
We just wanted you
to be happy.

03:54.717 --> 03:56.857
It's fine.
I'm fine.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.652
I think we all knew
that that marriage was over

03:58.755 --> 04:00.481
before it began anyway.

04:00.585 --> 04:03.967
Look, I just want to let both
of you know that everyone here,

04:04.071 --> 04:06.591
we are all on #TeamTahlia.

04:06.694 --> 04:09.456
There is no team.Nah.

04:09.559 --> 04:11.458
#TeamTaichOh.

04:18.430 --> 04:20.294
Coach: Hands, hands, hands.

04:20.398 --> 04:22.262
That's it, boys.

04:22.365 --> 04:23.780
Come on. Okay.

04:24.954 --> 04:26.680
Fletcher!

04:26.783 --> 04:28.406
Where's your head at?!

04:28.509 --> 04:31.063
Nine straight wins,
boys!

04:31.167 --> 04:34.481
It's good, but let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

04:39.486 --> 04:42.178
Yasmin's parents agree
that the most important thing

04:42.282 --> 04:47.010
is that we all grow
and learn from this experience.

04:47.114 --> 04:49.323
Which is why I'm thrilled
to offer you

04:49.427 --> 04:51.774
a permanent position
at the school.

04:51.877 --> 04:54.777
On what condition?What do you mean?

04:54.880 --> 04:55.950
Am I getting this job
because I'm

04:56.054 --> 04:57.504
Daniel Fletcher's
girlfriend?

04:57.607 --> 05:00.092
No.
Of course not.

05:00.196 --> 05:03.199
So if I told you we broke up,
that wouldn't make a difference.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.822
When you say "broke up",
what are we talking about?

05:05.926 --> 05:07.514
We're no longer together.

05:07.617 --> 05:11.587
No chance
of making it work?

05:11.690 --> 05:16.281
Thank you, Toni.

05:16.385 --> 05:19.664
But I'm going to have to
turn down your very kind offer.

05:19.767 --> 05:21.459
I don't understand.

05:21.562 --> 05:23.219
I'm a good teacher.

05:23.323 --> 05:27.568
I'm prepared, I work hard
and I support my students.

05:27.672 --> 05:32.608
And I want to be valued for that
and not my relationship status.

05:36.405 --> 05:37.647
Hi.
This is Connor.

05:37.751 --> 05:39.339
I don't check this,
so text me.

05:40.685 --> 05:42.272
Hi. It's me.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.033
I just want to let you know
that I will be going through

05:44.136 --> 05:45.793
with the Connor by Tahlia
launch tomorrow night.

05:45.897 --> 05:49.797
And, no, I will not be
rebranding in any way.

05:54.423 --> 05:55.527
Hello?
Diane?

05:55.631 --> 05:56.873
It's Tahlia.

05:56.977 --> 05:58.875
I will meet you
on one condition,

05:58.979 --> 06:02.327
I get to pick the restaurant
and you'll need your black Amex.

06:10.059 --> 06:11.440
Hey.
Oh, hey.

06:11.543 --> 06:12.924
Any luck with the job?

06:13.027 --> 06:15.064
Yeah.
I turned it down.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.894
Brody, I really appreciate
all of your help

06:17.998 --> 06:21.588
but I just don't think
it's going to be the right fit.

06:21.691 --> 06:23.659
Well, we should -- we should
grab a beer some time

06:23.762 --> 06:25.868
to celebrate you giving
this place the flick.

06:25.971 --> 06:28.526
And bring Dan, we can do the
whole meet and greet over again.

06:28.629 --> 06:30.735
Thanks, but I don't...

06:30.838 --> 06:32.219
think he'll come.

06:32.322 --> 06:33.910
Was it that bad
a first impression?

06:34.014 --> 06:35.325
No.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.569
Uh, we broke up.

06:37.673 --> 06:40.469
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, don't be.

06:40.572 --> 06:42.540
It's for the best
for both of us.

06:42.643 --> 06:44.058
Um, look, look.

06:44.162 --> 06:47.407
This is, um, probably too soon
to tell you this,

06:47.510 --> 06:53.067
but I-I like you
as more than a friend.

06:55.311 --> 06:56.933
I'm sorry. That's weird.
It's too soon.

06:57.037 --> 06:58.452
Yeah. Yeah.
It is.

06:58.556 --> 07:00.178
Yeah, it really is.
I...

07:00.281 --> 07:01.904
Brody, I think...

07:02.007 --> 07:06.115
you are the nicest man,
person.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.462
Despite our terrifying
difference in height,

07:08.566 --> 07:11.672
if you were to ask
me out, I'd probably...

07:11.776 --> 07:15.089
most definitely
would say yes.

07:15.193 --> 07:16.988
But not right now.

07:17.091 --> 07:20.750
I still love Dan
and I...

07:20.854 --> 07:22.959
probably will
for a while.

07:23.063 --> 07:25.099
That's not fair
to anyone.

07:26.584 --> 07:29.069
Um...

07:39.562 --> 07:42.910
Hey. I didn't know
you were home.

07:43.014 --> 07:46.293
Ella called.
Her flight's been delayed.

07:46.396 --> 07:47.915
It's my fault.

07:48.019 --> 07:50.159
I know.

07:50.262 --> 07:53.818
I haven't been the person
I always promised I'd be.

07:53.921 --> 07:56.510
I was trying so hard to keep it
all away from you.

08:00.065 --> 08:02.792
Why did you do it, Kath?
Why?

08:08.695 --> 08:11.560
He made me feel needed.

08:11.663 --> 08:13.700
I know you need me.

08:13.803 --> 08:15.771
But this was different.

08:15.874 --> 08:19.878
I know what
I signed up for.

08:19.982 --> 08:24.469
But part of me was asleep
for a really long time.

08:27.230 --> 08:30.613
I know it was the wrong
thing to do.

08:30.717 --> 08:34.410
I just want to find my way
back to you.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.378
I don't know
how we do that.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.814
Mads.

08:58.917 --> 09:01.437
Don't be alarmed,
but we have a code red here.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.163
Who died?

09:03.266 --> 09:04.992
No, break-ups.
Plural.

09:05.096 --> 09:07.616
Paige and Daniel
and Tahlia and Connor.

09:10.239 --> 09:12.690
I'm sorry.
You knew.

09:12.793 --> 09:14.208
How do you figure that?

09:14.312 --> 09:15.693
I'm an excellent
lie detector.

09:15.796 --> 09:17.695
Come on, don't bullshit
a bullshitter.

09:17.798 --> 09:20.283
I want to know the truth.

09:20.387 --> 09:21.699
Fine.

09:21.802 --> 09:23.183
But you are going to
Tahlia's launch.

09:23.286 --> 09:24.874
We all need to be there
to support her.

09:24.978 --> 09:26.600
No more weird excuses.

09:26.704 --> 09:27.981
You know my daughter's
coming home.

09:28.084 --> 09:30.811
Like I said,
you'll be there.

09:30.915 --> 09:33.642
Where's JJ?
He's with my mum.

09:33.745 --> 09:35.747
I had a few things
on today.

09:35.851 --> 09:38.198
I don't know much
about kids.

09:38.301 --> 09:39.889
Look, don't take this
the wrong way but I've actually

09:39.993 --> 09:41.339
got to pick him up
soon.

09:41.442 --> 09:43.410
Not that I don't appreciate
the visit.

09:43.513 --> 09:44.998
Yeah. I...

09:45.101 --> 09:47.587
I came by because I needed
to tell you something.

09:47.690 --> 09:49.968
If this is about Tahlia,
she told us.

09:50.072 --> 09:51.694
It's Jack.

09:51.798 --> 09:55.353
What about Jack?

09:55.456 --> 09:58.943
That day
on the river...

09:59.046 --> 10:01.255
I was there.

10:01.359 --> 10:03.741
I was angry at Jack.

10:03.844 --> 10:09.505
When I saw him in the water,
I knew they'd been fighting.

10:09.609 --> 10:13.578
Where's Jack?!What have you done?

10:13.682 --> 10:17.582
Oh! Oh!

10:17.686 --> 10:20.205
I made the boys
leave him there.

10:22.691 --> 10:25.072
Give us a hand?Nah, leave him there.

10:25.176 --> 10:26.729
Soft prick.

10:26.833 --> 10:31.285
Toughen up, princess.

10:31.389 --> 10:35.773
If we'd stayed
there with him...

10:35.876 --> 10:38.776
we could have
helped him.

10:38.879 --> 10:40.432
Who else was there?

10:40.536 --> 10:42.918
It doesn't matter.

10:43.021 --> 10:44.402
I was the one
that told them to leave.

10:44.505 --> 10:46.128
Who?

10:48.164 --> 10:50.546
Me...

10:50.650 --> 10:53.031
Fletcher...

10:53.135 --> 10:54.723
Was Rusty there?

11:02.800 --> 11:05.147
Yeah.

11:09.047 --> 11:11.394
Rusty left Jack
in the water?

11:11.498 --> 11:12.913
He did.

11:19.851 --> 11:23.199
Okay. I'm going to go
back with a 43.6% share.

11:23.303 --> 11:24.684
They should agree
to those terms.

11:24.787 --> 11:26.478
Good.
Anything else?

11:26.582 --> 11:28.101
Yes. I do have
a couple of questions,

11:28.204 --> 11:29.930
just regarding
the property portfolio.

11:30.034 --> 11:32.277
I thought
we'd settled that.

11:32.381 --> 11:35.729
This is in regards to the houses
in Coolangatta, Byron Bay

11:35.833 --> 11:37.489
and the apartment
in Airlie Beach.

11:37.593 --> 11:39.906
Those properties
belong to the club.

11:40.009 --> 11:42.322
Yes, but there are
some irregularities

11:42.425 --> 11:43.737
in the chain of title.

11:43.841 --> 11:45.532
In the holding company,
your name appears.

11:45.635 --> 11:47.741
They're investment
properties.

11:47.845 --> 11:49.605
For whom?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.159
Maddy, I appreciate
your interest.

11:52.263 --> 11:54.161
But there's nothing
untoward here.

11:54.265 --> 11:55.818
Of course.

11:55.922 --> 11:57.786
When it comes to mediation,
we can't have any surprises.

11:57.889 --> 12:00.512
Mmm. I'm sorry, look,
I'm running late.

12:00.616 --> 12:02.583
If you want to talk
through this again,

12:02.687 --> 12:04.758
we're going to have
to do it another time.

12:04.862 --> 12:06.380
Of course.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.214
Man:
...and the carpaccio.

12:12.317 --> 12:15.044
And um, we'll take the fondant
and the parsnip foam.

12:15.148 --> 12:18.116
Excuse me.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.118
Thank you.
Madam.

12:20.222 --> 12:21.948
We'll have a bottle
of your pinot gris, please.

12:22.051 --> 12:24.364
Look, I'm not staying long --I didn't say it was for you.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.613
I know we've never
been close.

12:34.132 --> 12:36.617
Fine.
I've never liked you.

12:36.721 --> 12:38.861
But your relationship
with my son has ended

12:38.965 --> 12:40.656
and there are
certain practicalities

12:40.760 --> 12:42.692
we need to discuss.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.867
Like what?
Money?

12:44.971 --> 12:48.319
You know, I earned double
what Connor did this year.

12:48.422 --> 12:50.735
And that's just endorsements
and appearances.

12:50.839 --> 12:53.358
I have a perfume that's stocked
in 288 stores, and --

12:53.462 --> 12:55.844
I've seen it in those
discount pharmacies.

12:55.947 --> 12:57.880
We've already shot
the marketing campaign,

12:57.984 --> 12:59.364
so if you're here
to talk me out of it,

12:59.468 --> 13:01.332
you're going to have
to contact your lawyer.

13:06.268 --> 13:08.373
What's this?

13:08.477 --> 13:10.203
The deed to your house.

13:10.306 --> 13:11.480
I don't want pity.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.171
It's not pity,
it's severance.

13:13.275 --> 13:14.759
I'm not an employee.

13:14.863 --> 13:16.761
Connor wants the apartment
in the city.

13:16.865 --> 13:19.281
He wants you to have
the house.

13:19.384 --> 13:22.767
That seems fair.I thought so. Yes.

13:22.871 --> 13:26.219
He doesn't want this to be
difficult and neither do I.

13:26.322 --> 13:29.601
I know it might seem
ridiculous now

13:29.705 --> 13:31.811
that the relationship's
ended,

13:31.914 --> 13:34.227
but I would like it
if we could be...

13:34.330 --> 13:36.401
Don't say "friends."

13:36.505 --> 13:38.334
...favored nations.

13:38.438 --> 13:42.511
With harsh trade embargoes.And a weapons agreement.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.099
Madam.

13:44.202 --> 13:46.377
She's going to need
a glass.

13:54.454 --> 13:55.800
Karlie.

13:55.904 --> 13:57.595
Hey, it's my
little trooper.

13:57.698 --> 13:59.045
How are you doing?
Good.

13:59.148 --> 14:00.563
Really good.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.738
Had an all-round epically
great day actually.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.844
So good to hear.

14:04.947 --> 14:06.569
Listen, I was wondering
if you might feel up

14:06.673 --> 14:08.399
to popping into the club
a little bit later on.

14:08.502 --> 14:10.815
Um...why?

14:10.919 --> 14:13.093
Well, I told Andrew
what happened with you and Dan

14:13.197 --> 14:15.855
and he's such a softie, he just
wants to make sure you're okay.

14:15.958 --> 14:18.719
That's really...thoughtful.

14:18.823 --> 14:21.067
Um, but I don't think
it's appropriate.

14:21.170 --> 14:23.552
You know, I'd understand but
I'm not quite sure Andrew will.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.657
You don't want to leave the club
on bad terms, do you?

14:25.761 --> 14:28.074
Do I have a choice?No. Not really.

14:36.013 --> 14:37.807
Joanna!

14:37.911 --> 14:39.706
Actually, you know what?
Let's go to the park instead.

14:39.809 --> 14:41.363
Come on. Let's go.
We'll go to the park.

14:41.466 --> 14:44.055
Jo-- Joanna?

14:48.301 --> 14:51.131
Did you not see me?
Joanna.

14:51.235 --> 14:53.064
Come on.

14:53.168 --> 14:55.101
Okay.

14:55.204 --> 14:56.654
This is depressing.

14:56.757 --> 14:58.483
Nothing's changed.

14:58.587 --> 15:00.209
You haven't seen
your room yet.

15:00.313 --> 15:02.108
I've put a Pilates Reformer
in there.

15:02.211 --> 15:04.248
You wouldn't do that.

15:04.351 --> 15:06.940
I still don't understand why
Dad didn't come pick me up.

15:07.044 --> 15:08.804
He's had a lot on his plate,
sweetheart.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.461
I haven't been home
since --

15:10.564 --> 15:12.290
Whose bloody fault's
that?

15:12.394 --> 15:14.016
Dad!

15:14.120 --> 15:15.776
Oh!

15:15.880 --> 15:17.192
Good to see you,
sweetie.

15:17.295 --> 15:18.607
I missed you.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.437
Thank you.
Thank you.

15:21.541 --> 15:22.852
Ah, no, I don't want
an ice-cream.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.407
Are you sure?
Yes. No.

15:28.410 --> 15:30.377
And not too far.

15:30.481 --> 15:31.965
Whose children
are those?

15:32.069 --> 15:33.863
They are the children
I look after.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.796
But, um,
who do they belong to?

15:35.900 --> 15:37.522
The people I work for.

15:37.626 --> 15:39.248
I thought maybe
they belonged

15:39.352 --> 15:42.355
to the man you fell wildly
in love with.

15:42.458 --> 15:43.632
That is the reason,
after all,

15:43.735 --> 15:45.565
why you left our family,
isn't it?

15:45.668 --> 15:48.154
It's not
the entire reason.

15:48.257 --> 15:49.983
Is it any part
of the reason at all?

15:50.087 --> 15:51.398
No.

15:51.502 --> 15:53.676
Joanna, you're going to have
to help me out here.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.471
If you had an issue,
you should have brought it up

15:55.575 --> 15:57.715
with me directly,
instead of inventing

15:57.818 --> 16:00.925
this frankly ludicrous
reason to quit.

16:01.029 --> 16:03.755
Your home is not
an appropriate place to work.

16:03.859 --> 16:05.516
Excuse me?

16:05.619 --> 16:09.002
You are very nice and when
appropriately disciplined

16:09.106 --> 16:10.970
your children
are well behaved.

16:11.073 --> 16:13.248
But the relationship
between you and your husband...

16:13.351 --> 16:15.319
What --
What about it?

16:15.422 --> 16:17.424
You're very vocal.

16:17.528 --> 16:19.564
In the bedroom,
when you do the sex.

16:19.668 --> 16:21.704
Yes. Okay. Thank you.
Got it. Yep.

16:21.808 --> 16:23.499
I will get you
an ice-cream now.

16:23.603 --> 16:25.812
Mm-hm.
Rum and Raisin.

16:25.915 --> 16:28.573
Thank you.

16:28.677 --> 16:32.060
You never remarried.
Why?

16:32.163 --> 16:34.027
I mean, you're obviously
incredibly difficult,

16:34.131 --> 16:36.029
but the rest of you...

16:36.133 --> 16:37.755
lady kept it tight.

16:37.858 --> 16:40.516
I've had my share of romances
and affairs.

16:40.620 --> 16:43.209
But they've lasted
their natural duration.

16:43.312 --> 16:46.039
And what is that,
a natural duration?

16:46.143 --> 16:48.559
After you have children,
you don't feel the same need

16:48.662 --> 16:50.250
to settle down
with a partner.

16:50.354 --> 16:52.597
You get more comfortable
being on your own.

16:52.701 --> 16:54.668
Do you ever
get lonely?

16:54.772 --> 16:57.085
You don't have to be alone
to be lonely.

16:57.188 --> 16:59.087
Besides, there's something
incredibly free

16:59.190 --> 17:01.675
about never having
someone to answer to.

17:01.779 --> 17:04.575
You can do whatever you like,
whenever you like.

17:04.678 --> 17:08.027
And I've never met a man
worth giving that up for.

17:08.130 --> 17:09.407
Except your son.

17:09.511 --> 17:11.375
Even him.

17:11.478 --> 17:13.101
On occasion.

17:13.204 --> 17:16.069
Okay. I'm going to need
to hear more about that.

17:21.626 --> 17:23.456
No, thank you.

17:27.529 --> 17:29.427
Okay. What's going on
with you two?

17:29.531 --> 17:30.911
I don't know what
you're talking about.Nothing.
We're fine.

17:31.015 --> 17:33.535
You're being all weird
and polite with each other.

17:33.638 --> 17:35.640
There's nothing weird
about being polite.

17:35.744 --> 17:37.263
You're sitting as far apart
as possible.

17:37.366 --> 17:39.541
This is where
I always sit.

17:39.644 --> 17:41.508
You know, your dad
is having a brilliant season.

17:41.612 --> 17:42.958
I've been following it.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.477
If you're hanging around
this weekend,

17:44.580 --> 17:46.755
I thought I'd sneak you
into a corporate box.

17:46.858 --> 17:48.584
Maybe.

17:48.688 --> 17:50.276
Maybe?

17:50.379 --> 17:52.036
Um...

17:52.140 --> 17:54.763
Yeah.
Depends.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.006
Can I bring a friend?

17:57.110 --> 17:58.939
Are you seeing someone?

17:59.043 --> 18:02.633
His name is Tran,
and he's incredible.

18:02.736 --> 18:05.049
He's coming to meet you
both tomorrow.

18:05.153 --> 18:06.395
Great.

18:07.914 --> 18:10.675
And there's something else
I've got to tell you.

18:10.779 --> 18:12.953
We're getting married.

18:15.611 --> 18:16.854
Dad...

18:16.957 --> 18:18.407
Just give him a minute,
sweetheart.

18:18.511 --> 18:20.306
You're getting married.

18:20.409 --> 18:22.618
Oh, don't worry, we're waiting
until the season's over.

18:22.722 --> 18:25.414
We're thinking Christmas
might be nice.

18:25.518 --> 18:27.968
You're 18.
We're in love.

18:28.072 --> 18:29.211
You're a teenager,
darling.

18:29.315 --> 18:30.937
You're being driven
by your hormones.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.766
I'm the same age you were
when you got married.

18:32.870 --> 18:34.423
Was that a mistake?

18:34.527 --> 18:35.873
Yes.Yes.

18:41.637 --> 18:43.087
What happened?
Is everything alright?

18:43.191 --> 18:45.331
Yeah. I'm fine.
It's youI'm pissed off with.

18:45.434 --> 18:47.885
Connor just turned up
at my house.

18:47.988 --> 18:50.508
He told me what really happened
at the river.

18:50.612 --> 18:51.992
Jessie, I --

18:52.096 --> 18:53.994
You left him there.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.102
Rus,
I asked you for the truth

18:58.206 --> 18:59.414
and I trusted you
to give me that.

18:59.517 --> 19:00.656
Why didn't you give me
that?

19:00.760 --> 19:03.625
'Cause it doesn't
change anything.

19:03.728 --> 19:05.972
Alright?
It's my fault.

19:06.075 --> 19:08.147
He was in the water
because of me.

19:08.250 --> 19:10.563
You lied to me.

19:10.666 --> 19:13.669
And not just me,
you lied to the police.

19:13.773 --> 19:16.189
You gave your testimony
at a coronial inquest,

19:16.293 --> 19:18.398
that's perjury, Rus.

19:20.607 --> 19:24.024
Yeah. Well, what are you
going to do?

19:24.128 --> 19:26.095
I'm sick of all this
brotherhood bullshit.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.787
All the lies
and the cover-ups.

19:27.890 --> 19:29.168
I want the truth.

19:29.271 --> 19:30.790
Jess.

19:37.245 --> 19:39.247
Hi, Mum.
Hello, monkeys!

19:39.350 --> 19:40.593
Guess what?
What?

19:40.696 --> 19:42.042
I ran into Joanna today.

19:42.146 --> 19:44.459
Oh, what happened?She did not fall in love.

19:44.562 --> 19:47.082
She invented a man because
she needed an excuse to leave

19:47.186 --> 19:48.842
because she felt uncomfortable
in our house

19:48.946 --> 19:52.950
because we have
too much sex.

19:53.053 --> 19:55.228
It's the walls between our room
and the spare room.

19:55.332 --> 19:56.781
They're too thin.
Told you.

19:56.885 --> 19:58.749
We are gold star, marathon-
winning overachievers

19:58.852 --> 20:00.095
in the sex department.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.545
Gold medallists,
standing on the podium

20:01.648 --> 20:03.167
singing the national anthem
every time.

20:03.271 --> 20:05.031
Yeah. She's the one
with the problem.

20:05.134 --> 20:06.722
She's a prude.
Alright?

20:08.759 --> 20:10.795
Although...
What?

20:10.899 --> 20:12.590
There was that one nanny,
Adrienne, remember?

20:12.694 --> 20:15.628
The one that walked in on me
during my, ah, alone time.

20:15.731 --> 20:17.423
Uh...
And Cynthia,

20:17.526 --> 20:20.184
the one you accidentally sexted
during my away game?

20:20.288 --> 20:22.290
That was a bit of side boob
and a leg.

20:22.393 --> 20:24.326
That was completely open
to interpretation.

20:24.430 --> 20:27.812
Was it?

20:27.916 --> 20:30.332
Oh, shit.

20:30.436 --> 20:32.576
They're all from
different agencies.

20:32.679 --> 20:35.441
We're never going to be able
to leave our children again.

20:39.652 --> 20:41.447
I think there might be more
to Jack's death

20:41.550 --> 20:43.414
than what's
in the coroner's findings.

20:43.518 --> 20:45.485
He wasn't alone
when his kayak capsized.

20:45.589 --> 20:47.970
I just found out a few of
the guys were with him.

20:48.074 --> 20:49.213
Who?

20:49.317 --> 20:51.422
Connor, Daniel, and Rusty.

20:51.526 --> 20:52.527
Rusty?

20:52.630 --> 20:54.218
I don't think
it was malicious,

20:54.322 --> 20:57.601
but they left him there and then
they didn't tell the coroner,

20:57.704 --> 20:59.603
which I don't understand if
they didn't do anything wrong.

20:59.706 --> 21:01.329
I had no idea.

21:01.432 --> 21:04.297
It's just...
It's never made any sense.

21:04.401 --> 21:08.059
And I am going crazy
trying to understand this.

21:11.304 --> 21:12.616
Hi.

21:12.719 --> 21:14.411
Mads, you know how
you always promised me

21:14.514 --> 21:16.033
if I ever needed
legal representation

21:16.136 --> 21:17.206
that you'd do it
pro bono?

21:17.310 --> 21:18.380
Yeah.

21:18.484 --> 21:19.830
But the second part
of that joke

21:19.933 --> 21:21.935
is that you finally snapped
and killed someone.

21:22.039 --> 21:23.799
You haven't, have you?

21:23.903 --> 21:25.525
No.

21:25.629 --> 21:27.493
But it is serious.

21:30.358 --> 21:32.463
Oh, you poor thing.
It's fine.

21:32.567 --> 21:33.947
I'm good.
Handling it.

21:34.051 --> 21:35.432
I would have gone straight back
to bed, if I was you.

21:35.535 --> 21:38.745
I'd become a recluse.
Get a cat or something.

21:38.849 --> 21:40.540
You know, it's funny you calling
and meeting me here.

21:40.644 --> 21:42.508
It's like Andrew's
personal assistant.

21:42.611 --> 21:43.854
I am.

21:43.957 --> 21:45.614
Is that new?

21:45.718 --> 21:47.651
Ah, well, no, it's been
a couple of weeks now.

21:47.754 --> 21:50.688
But I think I'm doing
an exceptionally good job.

21:50.792 --> 21:52.414
Good for you.

21:52.518 --> 21:55.141
Come on.
Andrew's waiting.

21:55.244 --> 21:56.522
Andrew: Paige.

21:56.625 --> 22:00.077
Sit.

22:00.180 --> 22:01.975
You look fresh.

22:02.079 --> 22:04.461
It's all Karlie.

22:04.564 --> 22:08.361
I'm so sad to hear
about you and Dan.

22:08.465 --> 22:10.467
You're one of my favorite
couples at this club.

22:10.570 --> 22:12.123
Thanks.

22:12.227 --> 22:13.884
I didn't know
you cared so much.

22:13.987 --> 22:16.887
I know how much
you mean to him.

22:16.990 --> 22:20.891
And I just want you to know,
if there's anything I can do.

22:20.994 --> 22:22.824
That's, um, really lovely.

22:22.927 --> 22:26.034
But unless you're dating Dan,
there's not much you can do.

22:26.137 --> 22:29.348
Dan's had
a brilliant season. Mm?

22:29.451 --> 22:31.211
Yeah. He's worked
really hard.

22:31.315 --> 22:34.214
I don't want what's happening
between you two...

22:34.318 --> 22:36.389
to effect that.

22:36.493 --> 22:37.839
Oh, no, no.
Of course not.

22:37.942 --> 22:39.496
That's the last thing
that I want.

22:39.599 --> 22:41.774
Great!
I'm glad you see it that way.

22:41.877 --> 22:44.673
Um, but this is the right
decision for both of us.

22:44.777 --> 22:46.330
I disagree.

22:46.434 --> 22:53.406
See, this club is on track
to make the finals.

22:53.510 --> 22:56.513
Why don't you wait until
the end of the season?

22:56.616 --> 22:59.067
See how you both
feel then. Hm?

22:59.170 --> 23:02.070
These boys,
they need stability,

23:02.173 --> 23:06.005
people to support them.

23:06.108 --> 23:08.525
If you think I haven't been
supporting Dan,

23:08.628 --> 23:11.148
then you have no idea
who I am.

23:13.219 --> 23:16.153

can I just ask?

24:22.391 --> 24:24.117
Did you prepay the dry-
cleaning bill on that dress?

24:24.221 --> 24:26.361
No. Why?Because it's gonna cost a bomb

24:26.465 --> 24:28.156
with all the sex you're
gonna have with Daniel in it.

24:28.259 --> 24:29.675

gonna happen, okay?

24:29.778 --> 24:30.986

fell out, but...

26:04.873 --> 26:07.531

26:07.635 --> 26:09.222
Hey, I'm glad
you're here.

26:09.326 --> 26:11.639
I wanted to run into you
before I go.

26:11.742 --> 26:13.744
You're going?

26:13.848 --> 26:15.815

26:25.445 --> 26:27.551
Bulgaria --Spain. Yeah. Right. Both.

26:27.655 --> 26:29.001
Yeah, I met up
with this recruiter who reckons

26:29.104 --> 26:31.348
she can get me
some teaching work in the UK.

26:31.451 --> 26:33.246
How long are you going for?Um, I don't know.

26:33.350 --> 26:35.179

this fragrance with us tonight.

27:16.704 --> 27:19.534
When Connor and I
were discussing this launch,

27:19.638 --> 27:23.987
he insisted that we auction off
some of his favorite pieces

27:24.090 --> 27:26.645
for the Jack Davies Foundation.

27:33.375 --> 27:36.482
First up, his Rado watch.

27:36.585 --> 27:39.416
Let's start the bidding
at $1,000.

27:39.519 --> 27:41.142
$1,000.
$2,000!

27:41.245 --> 27:43.627

27:52.809 --> 27:54.742

$500.

28:28.845 --> 28:31.054
$350?

28:31.157 --> 28:34.989
This is a unique opportunity
to own a part

28:35.092 --> 28:38.924

28:39.027 --> 28:40.442

28:40.546 --> 28:43.583

offer in

28:43.687 --> 28:48.243

of a bid of $5,000.

28:48.347 --> 28:50.625
And sold to Kath Rickards.

28:52.696 --> 28:56.355
Well, this is a bloody
expensive night.

28:56.458 --> 28:59.841
What did we miss?

29:05.674 --> 29:07.435
Oh, my goodness.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.368
I'm sorry to interrupt.

29:09.471 --> 29:10.610
Andrew,
could I have a word?

29:10.714 --> 29:12.198
Right now?

29:12.302 --> 29:14.856
Yeah. Unfortunately,
it's a little time sensitive.

29:17.928 --> 29:20.517
I agree, transparency
is important.

29:20.620 --> 29:23.209
But is this really
the right place?

29:25.625 --> 29:26.972
Kath.
Hi.

29:27.075 --> 29:28.697
We just want to ask
some questions.

29:28.801 --> 29:30.285
Sorry to draw you away.

29:30.389 --> 29:32.184
We wanted to ask about
what happened at the river.

29:32.287 --> 29:34.151
Jessie wants answers.

29:34.255 --> 29:35.946
You know everything
I do.

29:36.050 --> 29:38.397
You read
the coroner's report.

29:38.500 --> 29:41.020
Yeah, it just seems
there's a few details

29:41.124 --> 29:43.091
you didn't share
with the police.

29:43.195 --> 29:44.852
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:44.955 --> 29:47.578
Connor and Daniel were there
when Jack went into the water.

29:47.682 --> 29:50.202
They left him there
to swim back.

29:52.204 --> 29:53.895
I had no idea.

29:53.999 --> 29:56.449
But you knew Jack and Rusty
were together.

29:56.553 --> 29:57.968
Yeah.

29:58.072 --> 29:59.383
Yeah. And they wanted to
come out.

29:59.487 --> 30:01.316
They were going to come out
after the grand final.

30:01.420 --> 30:03.111
They came to you,
didn't they?

30:03.215 --> 30:05.700
Were you supportive
of that?

30:05.804 --> 30:07.322
Of course.

30:07.426 --> 30:10.394
So why did Jack
change his mind?

30:10.498 --> 30:13.466
Jack had just given a 50-meter
penalty away

30:13.570 --> 30:15.848
that lost us
a grand final.

30:15.952 --> 30:19.231
His face was in every newspaper
across the country.

30:19.334 --> 30:21.302
A pretty good reason
for changing your mind,

30:21.405 --> 30:23.476
don't you think?

30:23.580 --> 30:26.065
Any other accusations
you want to sling my way?

30:26.169 --> 30:28.550
Andrew,
it's not an accusation.

30:28.654 --> 30:31.726
I know it's a very emotional
topic.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.764
I'm gonna get back
to the party.

30:40.666 --> 30:42.771
Hey.
Well?

30:42.875 --> 30:44.532
He doesn't know anything.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.430
Bullshit.I'm sorry, Jess.

30:46.534 --> 30:48.847
We asked him about Connor,
and he said he had no idea.

30:48.950 --> 30:52.022
Look, I know it's hard to accept
what's happened to Jack.

30:52.126 --> 30:53.230
But maybe it was
an accident.

30:53.334 --> 30:54.576
No.
The drugs.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.061
The hit on the head.
No.

30:56.164 --> 30:57.752
He was a strong swimmer.
He was fit.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.686
I know he had issues, but he
didn't have a drug problem.

31:00.789 --> 31:02.964
Let me talk to Andrew.

31:05.967 --> 31:07.555
What happened?

31:07.658 --> 31:09.143
Connor was
at the river.

31:09.246 --> 31:12.905
When?
When Jack went under.

31:13.009 --> 31:14.803
He made the boys
leave him.

31:14.907 --> 31:17.461
Told him to swim back.

31:19.463 --> 31:20.948
Did you know?

31:21.051 --> 31:22.881
Of course not.
Your wife did.

31:22.984 --> 31:25.297
I'm trying to stay on top
of all this shit,

31:25.400 --> 31:26.988
and you can't even
keep me in the loop.

31:27.092 --> 31:29.163
I had no idea.What else does Kath know?

31:29.266 --> 31:30.681
Nothing.

31:30.785 --> 31:32.269
Then why does she keep
snooping around?

31:32.373 --> 31:34.444
She doesn't know anything.I hope not.

31:34.547 --> 31:38.413
You've gotta keep this
under control.

31:42.693 --> 31:45.420
Karlie! Hi!
Oh, hi.

31:45.524 --> 31:47.043
Um, do you know
where Andrew is?

31:47.146 --> 31:48.216
Yeah, he's with Brian.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.666
Oh. Where?

31:49.769 --> 31:52.531
I don't know.
He grabbed Brian and they left.

31:52.634 --> 31:54.050
Thank you.

31:54.153 --> 31:55.430
Brian: Who else
has Connor told?

31:55.534 --> 31:57.398
I don't know.
The last thing we need

31:57.501 --> 31:59.434
is another bloody enquiry
starting up.

31:59.538 --> 32:02.437
If he wants to come forward,
I'm not going to stop him.

32:02.541 --> 32:05.130
They'll say he is the reason
Jack's dead.

32:05.233 --> 32:08.098
But he's not, is he?

32:08.202 --> 32:10.687
Don't be so bloody stupid!

32:10.790 --> 32:16.210
Those boys, my boys,
have lost a brother.

32:16.313 --> 32:18.350
Now, I've lied to them
all season just to

32:18.453 --> 32:20.110
win you a fucking flag!

32:20.214 --> 32:22.147
I protected you.

32:22.250 --> 32:23.458
Bullshit!

32:23.562 --> 32:25.805
You don't give
a shit about me.

32:25.909 --> 32:27.842
You just didn't want
to jeopardize the team

32:27.946 --> 32:29.361
at the start of a season.

32:29.464 --> 32:31.018
What was the point
in coming forward?

32:31.121 --> 32:32.226
What would that have
achieved?

32:32.329 --> 32:33.779
It was a fucking accident!

32:33.882 --> 32:35.229
Yeah, exactly.

32:35.332 --> 32:36.989
If you had accepted
my resignation,

32:37.093 --> 32:38.922
and let me talk to
the cops --

32:39.026 --> 32:42.063
You would never have
worked again.

32:48.794 --> 32:52.004
Brian, if you
come forward now...

32:52.108 --> 32:53.799
I can't protect you.

32:53.902 --> 32:55.766
And you know
how it's gonna look.

32:55.870 --> 32:58.804
Yeah.
Yeah.

32:58.907 --> 33:02.359
It's going to look
like you killed him.

33:02.463 --> 33:05.259
Did you?

33:06.915 --> 33:10.678
Jessie, it was a figure
of speech.

33:10.781 --> 33:13.129
We all feel responsible
about what happened to Jack.

33:13.232 --> 33:15.269
Did you kill him?

33:15.372 --> 33:17.271
I never wanted to
lie to you.

33:17.374 --> 33:20.205
So tell me the truth.

33:28.454 --> 33:31.733
I followed them
along the river...

33:31.837 --> 33:35.289
Oi! Where's Rusty?

33:35.392 --> 33:37.636
They'd been fighting
for months.

33:37.739 --> 33:39.914
It was affecting
the whole team.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.985
Jack: You told me to end it.It was advice.

33:42.089 --> 33:43.814
Yeah, and I took it.And that was your choice!

33:43.918 --> 33:45.368
Oh, so it's my fault,
is it?

33:45.471 --> 33:47.784
I can't control how he reacts
any more than you can.

33:47.887 --> 33:50.373
Find him, sort it out,
or I'll drop both of you.

33:50.476 --> 33:52.375
You're a selfish prick.

33:52.478 --> 33:54.342
You would do anything
to win a flag, wouldn't you?

33:54.446 --> 33:56.241
Excuse me?

33:56.344 --> 33:58.691
You couldn't do it on the field
and you can't do it in the box!

33:58.795 --> 34:00.176
You're a fucking pretender.

34:00.279 --> 34:03.282
At least I didn't cost my team
the premiership.

34:05.905 --> 34:08.184
Oh!

34:11.704 --> 34:14.604
But you could have
helped him.

34:14.707 --> 34:16.192
I tried.

34:16.295 --> 34:18.228
Are you alright?

34:18.332 --> 34:20.541
Here.
Fuck off!

34:24.441 --> 34:26.202
Fuck this.

34:28.204 --> 34:30.378
He seemed okay
when I left.

34:39.870 --> 34:43.357
But if it was an accident,
why did you lie?

34:43.460 --> 34:47.050
How could I explain
to the members, the sponsors --

34:47.154 --> 34:48.534
Fuck the sponsors!

34:48.638 --> 34:51.503
Wait, my husband is dead
and you care about bad PR?

34:51.606 --> 34:54.264
I care about this club.
And Brian.

34:54.368 --> 34:55.783
If you'd supported
those boys...

34:55.886 --> 34:58.061
If you'd let them come out
when they wanted to...

34:58.165 --> 35:01.306
That kid had everything
ahead of him.

35:01.409 --> 35:03.170
And he was about
to blow it all up.

35:03.273 --> 35:04.792
They were in love!

35:04.895 --> 35:07.967
The football club is not a place
for the schoolyard romance.

35:08.071 --> 35:10.522
That was their decision
to make.

35:10.625 --> 35:12.558
Something's
rotten in this club...

35:12.662 --> 35:13.973
and it's you.

35:14.077 --> 35:16.562
I made the Southern Jets
what they are today.

35:16.666 --> 35:19.807
Bullshit.
Things are going to change.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.672
You'll hand in your resignation
first thing tomorrow.

35:22.775 --> 35:25.399
And why would I do that?

35:25.502 --> 35:27.504
I've been following
your chain of title.

35:27.608 --> 35:29.472
You've done well.

35:29.575 --> 35:34.028
Lots of different holding
companies, trust accounts.

35:34.132 --> 35:37.963
I'd strongly advise engaging
a criminal lawyer.

35:54.911 --> 35:56.637
OK, so what happens
to Andrew?

35:56.740 --> 35:59.295
Personally, I hope he's on the
first flight back to Scotland.

35:59.398 --> 36:01.297
Oh, Jessie.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.574
I'm so glad
I'm not leaving

36:02.677 --> 36:04.265
without you knowing
the whole story.

36:04.369 --> 36:05.922
Me too.

36:06.025 --> 36:07.993
Thank you.

36:10.444 --> 36:12.342
