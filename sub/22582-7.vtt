00:29.927 --> 00:32.202
- Subcommander.
- Yes?

00:32.807 --> 00:34.320
Did I wake you?

00:34.527 --> 00:37.325
It's all right. Is something wrong?

00:37.647 --> 00:39.558
We've located Menos.

00:41.167 --> 00:42.282
Where?

00:42.407 --> 00:45.524
Less than three days
from your present location.

00:45.647 --> 00:48.605
- Are you certain it's him?
- Yes.

00:54.407 --> 00:56.796
It's been a long road

00:58.647 --> 01:01.161
Gettin' from there to here

01:01.807 --> 01:04.605
It's been a long time

01:05.407 --> 01:08.877
But my time is finally near

01:09.247 --> 01:12.637
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:13.447 --> 01:16.280
I will touch the sky

01:16.727 --> 01:20.322
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:20.447 --> 01:23.359
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:23.487 --> 01:27.765
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:28.087 --> 01:30.999
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:31.127 --> 01:35.279
I've got faith to believe

01:35.487 --> 01:38.399
I can do anything

01:38.527 --> 01:42.202
I've got strength of the soul

01:43.087 --> 01:45.806
And no one's gonna bend or break me

01:45.927 --> 01:50.079
I can reach any star

01:51.527 --> 01:53.518
I've got faith

01:55.207 --> 01:58.358
I've got faith

01:58.927 --> 02:02.203
Faith of the heart

02:15.967 --> 02:17.195
Come in.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.318
- Good morning.
- Captain.

02:22.927 --> 02:24.485
- Toast?
- No, thank you.

02:26.087 --> 02:27.361
What can I do for you?

02:27.487 --> 02:31.002
Admiral Forrest will be calling you
this afternoon, sir.

02:31.247 --> 02:34.239
Will he? And how would you know that?

02:34.367 --> 02:37.404
I was contacted by
the Vulcan High Command last night.

02:37.527 --> 02:41.076
They've requested my services
regarding a matter of security.

02:42.567 --> 02:45.001
And they've already asked
Admiral Forrest?

02:45.127 --> 02:47.960
He should be contacting you
this afternoon.

02:48.927 --> 02:50.679
Matter of security?

02:51.087 --> 02:52.600
The Admiral will inform you...

02:52.727 --> 02:56.003
that Enterprise will be asked
to alter course to the Pernaia System...

02:56.127 --> 03:00.200
where I will need a shuttlepod
and a pilot for three to five days.

03:03.927 --> 03:06.157
You didn't answer my question.

03:07.207 --> 03:09.516
What kind of matter of security?

03:09.647 --> 03:11.842
A Vulcan ship will rendezvous
with the shuttlepod...

03:11.967 --> 03:14.276
when my mission is completed.

03:17.167 --> 03:19.681
They're sending you to get somebody.

03:20.487 --> 03:23.524
Somebody you'll be handing over
to the Vulcans.

03:25.887 --> 03:27.115
Why you?

03:29.607 --> 03:33.122
Admiral Forrest will be contacting you
this afternoon.

03:37.847 --> 03:41.601
Thanks for being so enlightening.
Dismissed.

03:56.087 --> 03:57.964
Captain's log, supplemental.

03:58.087 --> 04:00.999
As anticipated,
I was contacted by Admiral Forrest...

04:01.327 --> 04:04.558
who has ordered us to accommodate
the Vulcans' request.

04:04.687 --> 04:08.202
- Did you find the coordinates?
- Pernaia Prime. Yes, sir.

04:09.127 --> 04:10.560
Set a course.

04:10.687 --> 04:13.724
When we arrive,
you'll be piloting the shuttlepod.

04:13.847 --> 04:16.077
Where exactly will we be going?

04:16.447 --> 04:19.200
Somewhere in the Pernaia system,
no doubt.

04:19.327 --> 04:23.525
As far as the exact location,
Admiral Forrest doesn't even know that.

04:23.647 --> 04:26.844
It seems the Subcommander
is on a highly classified mission.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.958
Is this Pernaia Prime inhabited?

04:29.087 --> 04:32.318
The Vulcan database says
it has a methane-based atmosphere.

04:32.447 --> 04:35.439
So she's going to another planet
in the system.

04:36.887 --> 04:40.118
Are we supposed to play
some kind of guessing game?

04:41.007 --> 04:44.602
No, we're supposed to wait
at Pernaia Prime...

04:44.967 --> 04:47.765
for T'Pol and Travis
to finish their mission.

04:47.887 --> 04:49.559
And do what in the meantime?

04:49.687 --> 04:53.362
I could use a few days
to recalibrate the torpedo launchers.

04:53.487 --> 04:56.957
I could polish all the handles and rails
in Engineering.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.481
I guess I could purge
the impulse reactors.

05:02.807 --> 05:04.604
It's only for a few days.

05:04.727 --> 05:07.366
We've got plenty
to keep ourselves busy.

05:07.607 --> 05:11.361
Is there anything specific
you and Travis are going to need?

05:13.807 --> 05:16.924
Cold weather gear,
restraints, and phase pistols.

05:24.687 --> 05:25.881
Come in.

05:30.287 --> 05:33.916
If the Vulcan High Command doesn't
like the water polo match I'm watching...

05:34.047 --> 05:36.038
I'd be happy to find another.

05:36.367 --> 05:38.198
Your orders to bring me to Pernaia...

05:38.327 --> 05:41.125
came from Starfleet,
not the High Command.

05:43.207 --> 05:45.038
What can I do for you?

05:45.527 --> 05:48.485
I have a personal matter
I'd like to discuss.

06:01.567 --> 06:03.762
Before I joined
the Science Directorate...

06:03.887 --> 06:06.447
I was assigned
to the Ministry of Security.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.365
I was trained
in reconnaissance and retrieval.

06:09.567 --> 06:12.365
Move over, Porthos.
Let the lady sit down.

06:12.647 --> 06:15.241
Sounds like this is going to be good.

06:15.887 --> 06:17.525
Come on, sit down.

06:22.607 --> 06:24.245
How long ago are we talking about?

06:24.367 --> 06:27.245
I completed my training 17 years ago.

06:28.367 --> 06:29.641
Go ahead.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.805
Are you familiar
with a planet called Agaron?

06:33.287 --> 06:35.407
They're close allies
with the Vulcans, right?

06:35.527 --> 06:36.880
Not always.

06:37.407 --> 06:39.716
Agaron was a very corrupt world.

06:40.367 --> 06:43.643
When their leaders were first trying
to forge an alliance with Vulcan...

06:43.767 --> 06:47.362
they asked for our assistance.
That was nearly 30 years ago.

06:47.487 --> 06:49.796
Hundreds of our agents
were surgically altered...

06:49.927 --> 06:53.840
and sent to infiltrate the most criminal
factions of Agaron society.

06:53.967 --> 06:58.165
Eventually, they were instrumental
in the overthrow of those factions.

06:58.287 --> 07:00.517
You're not going to tell me...

07:01.207 --> 07:03.277
you're one of those agents.

07:03.407 --> 07:05.443
I'm not that old, Captain.

07:05.927 --> 07:10.000
After the alliance was formalised,
the Vulcan agents were recalled.

07:10.127 --> 07:13.563
They all returned voluntarily, all but 19.

07:15.247 --> 07:18.364
I guess even Vulcans
can fall prey to temptation.

07:18.607 --> 07:22.600
The Ministry of Security sent a team
of trained operatives to retrieve them.

07:23.767 --> 07:28.045
I was only able to apprehend
five of the six fugitives assigned to me.

07:29.447 --> 07:32.200
So tomorrow
you get to pick up number six?

07:33.287 --> 07:35.847
Why couldn't someone else do it?
Why you?

07:35.967 --> 07:38.925
The Ministry considers it
a matter of honour.

07:39.127 --> 07:40.719
How very Vulcan.

07:44.207 --> 07:46.562
So why have you decided
to tell me all this?

07:46.687 --> 07:49.360
- I'd like you to come with me.
- What?

07:49.527 --> 07:52.325
The man I'm being sent to apprehend
is extremely dangerous.

07:52.447 --> 07:55.280
It would be wise for me
to have assistance.

07:55.647 --> 07:58.286
You said there's a Vulcan ship coming.

07:58.407 --> 08:01.285
I'm sure they can provide
all the assistance you'll need.

08:01.407 --> 08:03.602
I'd prefer it
if you'd come with me, Captain.

08:03.727 --> 08:04.796
Why?

08:07.127 --> 08:09.766
I need to be with someone I can trust.

08:11.287 --> 08:14.916
If you don't wish to help me,
I understand.

08:23.167 --> 08:24.486
Good night.

08:25.847 --> 08:27.439
What's his name?

08:29.007 --> 08:31.396
The man we're going to apprehend.

08:32.647 --> 08:33.796
Menos.

08:36.527 --> 08:38.404
See you in the morning.

08:45.607 --> 08:48.485
If you agreed to go with her,
you must know what she's up to.

08:48.607 --> 08:50.643
We'll be back in three to five days, Trip.

08:50.767 --> 08:52.883
If that Vulcan ship
comes snooping around...

08:53.007 --> 08:55.567
the last thing to tell them
is that I'm with T'Pol.

08:55.687 --> 08:59.521
Why is that? Why would you being
with her be a problem to them?

09:00.767 --> 09:02.883
- Three to five days, Trip.
- Come on, Captain.

09:03.007 --> 09:06.682
Last night, you were as frustrated as me
about having to sit on your hands...

09:06.807 --> 09:10.277
while she goes off and does
whatever it is she's going off to do.

09:14.247 --> 09:16.238
This isn't just a case of curiosity.

09:16.367 --> 09:18.597
What if you get hurt, kidnapped?

09:18.727 --> 09:21.400
You put me in charge
and won't tell me where you're going?

09:21.527 --> 09:23.802
How am I supposed to be
a good temporary captain...

09:23.927 --> 09:26.646
if I don't know where my people are?
Tell me that.

09:27.127 --> 09:29.197
She's got some
unfinished business, Trip.

09:29.327 --> 09:32.717
I'm not sure why, but she needs me
to go along. We'll be okay.

09:33.847 --> 09:36.407
There are a lot of definitions
of "unfinished business."

09:36.527 --> 09:39.485
- Could you be more specific?
- You're in charge, Commander.

09:39.607 --> 09:42.519
- Have you given Travis the coordinates?
- Yes.

09:44.447 --> 09:45.675
Have fun.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.405
Before he was sent to Agaron...

09:55.527 --> 09:57.836
the dorsal lobes of his ears
were surgically altered.

09:57.967 --> 10:00.925
The ridge on his forehead was added
sometime afterward.

10:01.047 --> 10:03.322
Why didn't he want to come home?

10:03.807 --> 10:07.004
He was assigned to infiltrate
a cell of smugglers.

10:07.167 --> 10:10.477
He learned their craft.
He became very proficient at it...

10:10.607 --> 10:11.960
amassed a large fortune.

10:12.087 --> 10:13.406
Smuggling what?

10:13.527 --> 10:17.645
Synthetic bio-toxins, used to
manufacture transgenic weapons.

10:21.047 --> 10:25.325
I spent three months trying to find him.
He used his wealth wisely.

10:25.447 --> 10:28.962
Whenever I'd get close,
I'd find he'd left a day or two before.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.805
You never found him?

10:30.927 --> 10:32.838
Only once, on Risa.

10:35.207 --> 10:37.596
They thought they were invulnerable.

10:37.727 --> 10:39.763
- "They"?
- He.

10:41.287 --> 10:43.847
He thought he was invulnerable there...

10:43.967 --> 10:47.198
that no one would think to look for him
on such a peaceful place.

10:47.327 --> 10:48.806
What happened?

10:51.887 --> 10:53.525
I got very close.

10:54.567 --> 10:57.525
Twenty metres, maybe ten.

11:00.687 --> 11:01.836
T'Pol?

11:04.207 --> 11:07.085
I never found him again. No one did.

11:08.887 --> 11:10.366
Not until now.

11:41.007 --> 11:42.326
He's here.

11:51.527 --> 11:52.676
Where?

11:53.767 --> 11:55.564
Within 30 metres.

11:57.327 --> 12:00.399
If he sees T'Pol,
he may try to get to his ship.

13:06.807 --> 13:08.126
- He saw me.
- Which way?

13:08.247 --> 13:09.839
I'm not certain.

13:30.247 --> 13:31.805
I couldn't agree more.

13:35.527 --> 13:36.880
Don't move.

13:47.847 --> 13:50.077
You have no jurisdiction here.

13:52.527 --> 13:53.846
Follow me.

14:00.687 --> 14:01.961
Come in.

14:02.447 --> 14:05.245
Gentlemen, come in.
Glad you could join me.

14:05.447 --> 14:06.675
Water polo?

14:06.807 --> 14:09.560
Very exciting sport.
You should learn more about it.

14:09.687 --> 14:11.325
Please, sit down.

14:14.087 --> 14:18.126
I had Chef prepare a special lunch.
Bangers and mash for you...

14:18.247 --> 14:20.556
- and Denobulan sausage for the Doctor.
- Very nice.

14:20.687 --> 14:24.316
Are you sure the Captain wouldn't mind
you using his dining room?

14:24.447 --> 14:27.837
Acting Captain, Captain's Mess.
I don't see a problem.

14:28.727 --> 14:30.445
Thank you, crewman.

14:34.927 --> 14:36.997
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

14:39.767 --> 14:43.043
I detected a lymphatic virus on board
this morning.

14:43.167 --> 14:46.045
Most likely it sneaked in
with one of the deuterium canisters.

14:46.167 --> 14:48.397
We should probably inoculate the crew.

14:48.527 --> 14:50.279
Why didn't the bio-scanners detect it?

14:50.407 --> 14:53.365
Well, it's a very reliable device,
but it's not perfect.

14:53.487 --> 14:55.876
The inoculation does have
some side effects.

14:56.007 --> 14:57.360
What kind of side effects?

14:57.487 --> 15:02.197
Headache, nausea, diarrhoea.
But they would subside in a day or two.

15:03.087 --> 15:05.078
Do I have your permission?

15:06.847 --> 15:10.601
I'd hate to be responsible
for giving the crew the runs.

15:11.367 --> 15:13.722
Maybe you should wait
till the Captain gets back.

15:13.847 --> 15:18.045
I'm afraid the virus will have spread
by then. I really need an answer today.

15:19.607 --> 15:21.802
Why don't I get back to you later, Doc?

15:21.927 --> 15:23.599
Not too much later.

15:25.167 --> 15:26.964
While we're on
the subject of approvals...

15:27.087 --> 15:30.636
I promised Captain Archer that
I'd recalibrate the torpedo launchers.

15:30.767 --> 15:33.406
I'll need to divert computer access
from Main Engineering.

15:33.527 --> 15:35.916
That would mean
we'd have to power down the warp core.

15:36.047 --> 15:39.084
It'll only be for a day.
We're not exactly going anywhere.

15:39.207 --> 15:41.243
And we're also not at war.

15:41.367 --> 15:44.359
I'm just not comfortable
taking the engines off-line right now.

15:44.487 --> 15:48.082
Is that the Chief Engineer talking,
or the Acting Captain?

15:51.087 --> 15:52.964
Let me get back to you.

15:57.567 --> 15:58.602
Tucker.

15:58.727 --> 16:01.116
We were just hailed
by the Vulcan ship Nyran, sir.

16:01.247 --> 16:03.238
It's approaching the system
at high warp.

16:03.367 --> 16:05.835
They're asking to speak
with Captain Archer.

16:06.927 --> 16:10.761
Tell them the Captain's indisposed
at the moment.

16:11.367 --> 16:14.279
- He'll get back to them in a little while.
- Yes, sir.

16:16.247 --> 16:19.842
The Captain said not to tell the Vulcans
he went with T'Pol.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.999
He was very emphatic about that.

16:22.127 --> 16:26.598
It's going to be difficult to convince them
he's indisposed for the next four days.

16:32.127 --> 16:33.162
Go ahead.

16:33.287 --> 16:36.040
Captain Tavek says he has a message
from Admiral Forrest.

16:36.167 --> 16:38.397
He seems very anxious to speak
with Captain Archer.

16:38.527 --> 16:40.438
What shall I tell him?

16:41.327 --> 16:43.124
I'll get back to you.

16:53.167 --> 16:56.762
Your warrant is valid,
but you won't be able to take him.

16:57.047 --> 16:59.197
Not for at least four hours.

16:59.327 --> 17:01.716
We've begun thermalising
the landing deck.

17:01.847 --> 17:03.678
We just need to get him to our ship.

17:03.807 --> 17:07.117
There's 0.5 cm of xylathoric acid
on that deck.

17:07.247 --> 17:11.398
I wouldn't recommend it. Not if
you value those pretty feet of yours.

17:11.527 --> 17:14.644
Do you have somewhere
we can put him until we leave?

17:14.807 --> 17:17.275
Does this look like a prison to you?

17:28.127 --> 17:30.482
Any one of these people
could be working with him.

17:30.607 --> 17:33.838
The Ministry of Security
was very clear about that.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.800
He works alone.

17:36.487 --> 17:38.125
I haven't always.

17:50.407 --> 17:51.840
You're human.

17:54.327 --> 17:55.965
And you, as well.

17:57.727 --> 18:00.082
They wanted to rehabilitate me...

18:02.287 --> 18:03.766
bring me home...

18:05.527 --> 18:09.600
flatten my forehead
and re-point my ears.

18:10.487 --> 18:12.364
They wanted to teach me to forget...

18:12.487 --> 18:15.524
the life they had taught me so carefully
how to live.

18:16.767 --> 18:19.281
They assumed I had become corrupt...

18:20.367 --> 18:24.883
and that, left to my own devices,
I would remain corrupt.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.682
Three years in a Vulcan clinic.

18:31.287 --> 18:33.005
Rehabilitation.

18:35.367 --> 18:37.562
Can you blame me for running?

18:39.927 --> 18:41.519
I'm not a thief.

18:41.967 --> 18:44.276
I'm not a smuggler. I never was.

18:46.047 --> 18:47.958
I worked with smugglers.

18:48.367 --> 18:51.040
I worked very close with them
for a long time.

18:51.167 --> 18:52.847
It's what I had been trained to do.

18:52.847 --> 18:53.643
It's what I had been trained to do.

18:54.287 --> 18:57.563
Do you know how I've survived
the last 20 years?

18:57.687 --> 18:59.439
How I fed my family?

19:00.047 --> 19:03.198
I haul spent warp injector casings.

19:03.607 --> 19:06.883
Not a very popular occupation,
but a necessary one.

19:09.007 --> 19:13.683
A doctor on Andoria says that
my haemolytic cell count is over 3,000.

19:15.727 --> 19:19.322
You don't find too many old men
hauling spent injector casings.

19:22.567 --> 19:24.127
My left front pocket, if you don't mind.

19:24.127 --> 19:25.321
My left front pocket, if you don't mind.

19:26.247 --> 19:28.283
I wouldn't. It may be a weapon.

19:28.407 --> 19:32.639
It's a hologram of my family.
They won't hurt you.

19:53.767 --> 19:56.804
The injector casings are going to
take me away from them soon.

19:56.927 --> 19:59.043
I don't want to die in a Vulcan prison.

19:59.167 --> 20:02.523
The information I was given says
that you buy high grade bio-toxins...

20:02.647 --> 20:05.207
and sell them to anyone
who will meet your price.

20:05.327 --> 20:07.761
If all the Ministry's reports
about me were true...

20:07.887 --> 20:11.800
I could easily shape shift
and slip out of these restraints...

20:12.287 --> 20:14.755
or sprout wings and fly to my ship.

20:15.087 --> 20:17.840
Why should she believe a fugitive
and not her government?

20:17.967 --> 20:22.722
Because her government sent
109 agents to Agaron 30 years ago...

20:22.847 --> 20:26.203
and they want all 109 accounted for.

20:26.847 --> 20:29.042
Right or wrong, dead or alive.

20:29.327 --> 20:32.444
If you're innocent, you'll be given
a chance to defend yourself.

20:32.567 --> 20:34.159
But I'm guilty!

20:34.287 --> 20:37.279
I'm guilty of not returning
when I was told to.

20:38.607 --> 20:43.123
I'm innocent of selling bio-toxins,
but I'm guilty of being a fugitive.

20:43.887 --> 20:47.277
But I don't deserve to go to prison,
and I don't deserve to be shot.

20:47.407 --> 20:51.241
We're here to take you to Vulcan.
No one's going to shoot you.

20:52.367 --> 20:53.880
What about her?

21:02.607 --> 21:04.086
You're a liar!

21:14.447 --> 21:16.438
What are you doing?

21:17.487 --> 21:19.557
He's not telling the truth.

21:27.127 --> 21:29.402
Where the hell are you going?

21:30.807 --> 21:33.799
He says he has a ship
full of injector casings.

21:33.927 --> 21:36.521
But the platforms are covered with acid.

22:24.447 --> 22:25.596
Jossen!

22:56.287 --> 22:57.686
You're sure?

22:57.807 --> 23:02.005
There's no record of them ever
having spoken, but I can't be certain.

23:02.367 --> 23:03.846
Has he ever been to Earth?

23:03.967 --> 23:07.164
If he has,
the Vulcan database doesn't mention it.

23:07.407 --> 23:11.002
I hope they haven't put Starfleet
yearbook photos in that database.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.763
Let's get this over with.

23:23.247 --> 23:27.365
Captain Tavek, is there something
I can do for you?

23:28.007 --> 23:30.396
- Captain Archer?
- Yes.

23:33.327 --> 23:35.443
Is there a problem?

23:35.927 --> 23:38.760
You seem very young
for a Starfleet Captain.

23:40.087 --> 23:41.600
Healthy living.

23:42.367 --> 23:45.200
You have a message
from Admiral Forrest?

23:45.327 --> 23:46.840
I'm not certain what this means...

23:46.967 --> 23:49.561
but the Admiral asked me
to inform you that...

23:50.447 --> 23:53.837
Cal beat Stanford 7 to 3.

23:54.687 --> 23:57.326
- I'll be sure to tell him.
- Tell who?

23:59.487 --> 24:01.398
I'm afraid it's confidential.

24:01.527 --> 24:04.724
Thank you for relaying the message.
Archer out.

24:22.047 --> 24:24.720
That wasn't too smart.
You could have been hurt.

24:25.167 --> 24:26.805
What did you find?

24:28.887 --> 24:30.764
Spent injector casings.

24:33.167 --> 24:36.045
You'll have to go through decon
when we get back.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.036
I want to speak to Menos alone.

24:42.447 --> 24:44.642
Would you allow me to do that?

24:46.927 --> 24:48.485
Come on, Travis.

24:49.607 --> 24:52.405
Let's see if we can find
something to eat.

25:19.687 --> 25:21.086
Who is Jossen?

25:22.487 --> 25:25.320
You didn't find
what you were looking for, did you?

25:25.607 --> 25:28.997
- Who is Jossen?
- Lf this is your idea of humour...

25:31.807 --> 25:33.479
Tell me who he is.

25:35.207 --> 25:37.516
Jossen was no different than me.

25:39.727 --> 25:42.560
He didn't want
to be rehabilitated, either.

25:48.727 --> 25:50.206
Where did I meet him?

25:50.327 --> 25:53.558
Meet him? On Risa.

25:54.927 --> 25:57.919
Jossen and I were on Risa
in the Tropical Zone.

25:58.407 --> 26:01.558
We were innocent of the crimes
the Ministry had accused us of...

26:01.687 --> 26:04.076
but we were running, all the same.

26:08.207 --> 26:11.404
Why do you want me to tell you
things you already know?

26:11.927 --> 26:14.999
- You're telling me lies.
- No. The truth.

26:15.647 --> 26:19.162
I followed you to Risa, no one else.

26:19.927 --> 26:23.237
I bribed the Tellarite transport captain
who brought you there.

26:23.367 --> 26:27.645
He told me exactly where to find you.
I wasn't looking for anyone else.

26:28.247 --> 26:31.000
Then why are you asking me
about Jossen?

26:31.367 --> 26:33.119
He never hurt anyone.

26:33.887 --> 26:36.799
He didn't deserve to be hunted down
like an animal.

26:41.087 --> 26:43.760
- I killed him.
- Yes.

26:44.567 --> 26:47.035
And he didn't deserve to be killed.

26:47.287 --> 26:49.926
He was an innocent man, just like I am.

26:57.447 --> 27:00.996
You really don't remember.
How is that possible?

27:02.327 --> 27:04.887
Why did you kill him?
He never would have hurt you.

27:05.007 --> 27:07.521
- Stop talking.
- You're a Vulcan.

27:08.047 --> 27:12.643
You're trained to repress the emotion
of killing, not the memory of the act.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.725
I said, stop talking!

27:15.847 --> 27:18.805
Look what it's done to you,
taking an innocent life.

27:19.727 --> 27:22.002
Bringing me back to Vulcan
will be no different.

27:22.127 --> 27:25.403
You'll be destroying another life.
How will that affect you?

27:25.607 --> 27:28.883
Will you conveniently forget
what you're about to do to me?

27:31.967 --> 27:33.446
Where's Menos?

27:38.487 --> 27:40.762
- Get back over there.
- Aye, sir.

27:55.367 --> 27:56.846
What happened?

28:00.047 --> 28:02.720
- There were seven.
- Seven what?

28:04.367 --> 28:07.325
I was sent to bring back seven fugitives,
not six.

28:08.167 --> 28:09.885
I don't understand.

28:12.007 --> 28:16.285
Menos had a partner, or a friend.
I'm not sure.

28:20.247 --> 28:24.286
His name was Jossen.
I followed them both to Risa...

28:24.447 --> 28:25.960
not just Menos.

28:26.087 --> 28:30.080
The day I told you I saw Menos
and lost him...

28:32.207 --> 28:35.324
I saw Jossen, as well.
They tried to escape.

28:35.447 --> 28:37.483
Jossen fell to the ground.

28:40.087 --> 28:42.442
He began to reach for his weapon.

28:44.447 --> 28:46.165
But you fired first?

28:47.167 --> 28:50.364
I had forgotten all of it, until today.

28:52.247 --> 28:53.316
How?

28:54.167 --> 28:57.364
- Have you heard of the Fullara?
- No.

28:57.847 --> 29:00.407
It's an obsolete Vulcan ritual...

29:01.087 --> 29:03.681
where the memory of an event
is repressed...

29:03.807 --> 29:07.561
along with the emotions
associated with it.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.685
And you had this...

29:10.807 --> 29:14.516
- Fullara.
- This Fullara ritual performed?

29:14.887 --> 29:18.118
When I returned to Vulcan,
I was unsettled.

29:20.127 --> 29:22.357
I resigned my position
with the Ministry...

29:22.487 --> 29:25.445
and sought guidance
at the Sanctuary of P'Jem.

29:27.447 --> 29:31.156
For months, one of the Elders
worked with me to control the guilt...

29:31.767 --> 29:36.397
to restrain the despair
of having taken a life.

29:38.847 --> 29:40.838
But the feelings remained.

29:41.207 --> 29:44.756
Why would you feel guilty
if this Jossen...

29:45.927 --> 29:47.918
was about to fire at you?

29:52.007 --> 29:55.443
I suppose I was never certain
what his intentions were.

29:56.287 --> 29:59.484
The Elder had no choice
but to perform the ritual.

30:00.727 --> 30:03.321
When I left the Sanctuary,
I didn't remember anything...

30:03.447 --> 30:05.438
about Jossen or the Fullara.

30:05.567 --> 30:07.205
When did it start coming back?

30:07.327 --> 30:10.160
When the first call came in
about this new mission.

30:11.447 --> 30:14.086
Maybe that's why I wanted you with me.

30:14.687 --> 30:17.884
What if Jossen wasn't a smuggler?
What if he was innocent?

30:18.087 --> 30:21.079
It wouldn't matter whether
he intended to use that weapon or not.

30:21.207 --> 30:23.357
That doesn't make any sense.

30:24.047 --> 30:25.560
What's Menos been telling you?

30:25.687 --> 30:29.566
Menos' ship was filled
with injector casings, nothing else.

30:30.487 --> 30:32.079
He has a family.

30:32.847 --> 30:35.839
Our scans can confirm
if he's dying of radiation poisoning.

30:35.967 --> 30:38.037
What's he been telling you?

30:47.207 --> 30:48.925
He kicked over the table.

30:49.967 --> 30:53.437
- And you claim you're a peaceful man.
- Ironic, isn't it?

30:53.807 --> 30:56.162
Burning to death on a frozen moon.

30:56.367 --> 30:57.686
But I'd rather die here...

30:57.807 --> 31:01.322
than be brought back and punished
for crimes I never committed.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.920
Refasten them.

31:17.687 --> 31:19.359
- Where's Menos?
- Travis!

31:23.327 --> 31:24.521
Come on.

31:27.127 --> 31:28.765
Where's his ship?

31:29.887 --> 31:33.880
Your mission is to return him to Vulcan,
not determine if he's guilty or innocent.

31:34.007 --> 31:35.360
Where's his ship?

31:59.047 --> 32:00.605
He's not aboard.

32:04.847 --> 32:06.326
Let's be sure.

32:19.007 --> 32:21.680
We'll all need to go through decon now.

32:32.767 --> 32:34.246
He's not here.

32:34.527 --> 32:36.518
Was that the only way in?

32:37.767 --> 32:39.917
- Go back to the cockpit, Travis.
- Aye, sir.

32:40.047 --> 32:43.517
Get life-support fired up if you can.
It's pretty cold.

32:49.087 --> 32:51.681
He should have gotten here before us.

32:52.087 --> 32:53.998
This ship shouldn't be here.

32:54.127 --> 32:56.357
Why risk using his own vessel?

32:56.887 --> 32:58.479
He'd know we'd follow him.

32:58.607 --> 33:02.122
So he could have left
with any one of those other ships.

33:02.287 --> 33:03.879
Any one of them.

33:04.807 --> 33:06.763
You seem okay with that.

33:08.047 --> 33:10.163
When we return to Enterprise...

33:10.287 --> 33:13.245
I'll inform the Vulcan ship
that Menos escaped.

33:13.447 --> 33:15.881
If the High Command wishes,
they can question...

33:16.007 --> 33:18.680
as many of the vessels that left here
as they can find.

33:18.807 --> 33:21.446
You're giving up a lot easier
than I would have guessed.

33:21.567 --> 33:24.206
- He's obviously gone.
- We don't know that.

33:29.287 --> 33:32.677
He got to you, didn't he?
You're beginning to doubt yourself.

33:33.447 --> 33:36.564
He knew if he could get you
to question what you did 17 years ago...

33:36.687 --> 33:39.155
you'd begin to question
what you're doing right now.

33:39.287 --> 33:41.801
I may have killed an innocent man
17 years ago.

33:41.927 --> 33:44.122
- Did Jossen reach for his weapon?
- I don't know.

33:44.247 --> 33:46.442
Is that what you remember
or what Menos wants you to remember?

33:46.567 --> 33:48.080
- What's the difference?
- There's a big difference.

33:48.207 --> 33:50.357
He's playing on your guilt.
Don't you see that?

33:50.487 --> 33:53.320
That's impossible. I went to P'Jem.

33:53.447 --> 33:55.881
- They performed the ritual...
- Don't give me that.

33:56.007 --> 33:58.646
Your emotional immune system
started to collapse again...

33:58.767 --> 34:01.679
the minute you remembered
what happened that day on Risa.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.445
- Captain.
- What is it, Travis?

34:03.567 --> 34:07.196
There's something funny up here, sir.
Think you could take a look?

34:12.047 --> 34:13.002
What's up?

34:13.127 --> 34:16.402
After I got the board running,
I brought life-support up to Level 3.

34:16.527 --> 34:20.839
Once I got more light here, I noticed
condensation on this sub-panel.

34:20.967 --> 34:23.925
There's a hell of a lot of energy
flowing through those circuits.

34:24.047 --> 34:25.366
Any idea what they are?

34:25.487 --> 34:27.955
Our scanners showed
everything powered down.

34:28.447 --> 34:30.722
Obviously, something's powered up.

34:32.887 --> 34:35.525
There's one way to find out what it is.

34:40.206 --> 34:42.437
I'm a very patient man, T'Pol.

34:43.007 --> 34:45.362
I was simply waiting for you to leave...

34:46.087 --> 34:48.806
but the Captain's curiosity
has put an end to that.

34:48.927 --> 34:51.395
Would you please lower your weapon?

34:56.607 --> 34:58.882
There's some kind of
energy field running...

34:59.007 --> 35:01.965
I don't want to harm T'Pol, Captain,
but I will.

35:03.087 --> 35:05.726
Those are violent words
for a peaceful man.

35:05.847 --> 35:08.839
At the moment,
I'm a man who needs to survive.

35:11.567 --> 35:14.035
There's a locker right next to you.

35:14.767 --> 35:18.760
I want you to both put your weapons
down and then walk into it.

35:19.047 --> 35:21.356
- You won't be hurt.
- What about her?

35:21.527 --> 35:23.757
T'Pol is my guarantee that...

35:23.887 --> 35:27.641
the two of you will walk quickly
and quietly into the locker.

35:29.167 --> 35:29.767
Please.

35:29.767 --> 35:30.358
Please.

35:52.967 --> 35:56.118
The locking code is 1661.

35:56.247 --> 35:59.478
There is a very specific tone
when it's entered properly.

36:07.047 --> 36:08.560
- You okay?
- Yes.

36:14.127 --> 36:18.439
We don't do quickly and quietly
very well, but we are good at arithmetic.

36:18.567 --> 36:21.559
It seems there's three of us
and only one of you.

36:26.367 --> 36:28.119
Stop! Please!

36:34.647 --> 36:35.966
I don't trust this guy, Travis.

36:36.087 --> 36:38.647
- Find something to tie him up with.
- Aye, sir.

36:40.087 --> 36:41.759
What are you doing?

36:44.687 --> 36:45.881
Get up!

36:54.647 --> 36:55.762
Stop!

36:59.607 --> 37:01.484
You're not going to shoot me, T'Pol.

37:01.607 --> 37:04.599
You're not going to kill
another innocent man.

37:05.207 --> 37:07.482
This is none of your concern, Captain.

37:08.087 --> 37:11.045
You know nothing
about what happened on Risa.

37:17.487 --> 37:18.715
Captain?

37:21.887 --> 37:23.878
Why did you want me here?

37:25.527 --> 37:28.519
- Because I trust you.
- Then trust me.

37:29.207 --> 37:32.722
You were sent to apprehend him,
not to judge him.

37:46.207 --> 37:48.767
He's not going to get out of that
too quickly.

37:48.887 --> 37:52.402
I think I know why he was nervous about
us firing at him while he was here.

37:52.527 --> 37:53.960
Look at this.

37:59.727 --> 38:01.080
Bio-toxins.

38:01.887 --> 38:04.276
If one of our weapons had struck this...

38:06.207 --> 38:09.483
I guess he was hauling more
than injector casings after all.

38:12.687 --> 38:14.200
I guess he was.

38:19.127 --> 38:21.436
Captain's star log, supplemental.

38:21.607 --> 38:25.077
The Vulcan ship Nyran was waiting
at the prearranged coordinates.

38:25.207 --> 38:29.439
After transferring Menos to
their custody, we returned to Enterprise.

38:30.687 --> 38:33.759
- What's your status, Trip?
- Everything's ready to go, Captain.

38:33.887 --> 38:36.481
- Welcome back.
- Thanks. We'll be going to warp 3.

38:36.607 --> 38:37.926
You got it.

38:40.207 --> 38:41.925
Now that your secret mission is over...

38:42.047 --> 38:46.006
can you give your Chief Engineer
a little hint about what you were up to?

38:46.487 --> 38:49.923
Did I say warp 3?
I meant warp 4, Commander.

38:51.287 --> 38:52.845
Not even a hint?

38:55.527 --> 38:58.325
Warp 4. Aye, Captain.

39:00.967 --> 39:02.195
Come in.

39:04.927 --> 39:09.443
Subcommander. Am I about to get
another call from Admiral Forrest?

39:09.967 --> 39:11.195
No, sir.

39:13.207 --> 39:14.356
Sorry.

39:17.207 --> 39:19.641
Dealing with these memories...

39:22.327 --> 39:25.080
it's not going to be easy for you, is it?

39:27.207 --> 39:28.401
No, it's not.

39:28.887 --> 39:30.878
If you feel
you need a leave of absence...

39:31.007 --> 39:32.963
That won't be necessary.

39:33.447 --> 39:35.563
I was much younger then.

39:35.687 --> 39:38.645
You've also spent a lot of time
around humans lately.

39:38.767 --> 39:42.362
You do have a way of putting
questionable actions behind you.

39:43.447 --> 39:46.564
When you don't have the ability
to repress emotions...

39:46.687 --> 39:49.360
you learn to deal with them
and move on.

39:52.767 --> 39:54.758
Was there something else?

39:55.647 --> 39:58.400
If you ever need someone
you can trust...

39:59.367 --> 40:00.880
I won't forget.

40:01.305 --> 40:07.581
