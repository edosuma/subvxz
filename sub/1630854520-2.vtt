WEBVTT

01:19.538 --> 01:20.539
What--

01:22.165 --> 01:23.250
And you are?

01:23.333 --> 01:25.169
I've come about the money.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.088
Jamal's or Demetrio's?

01:30.090 --> 01:31.675
Demetrio's.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.052
Tell the greedy arsehole
to go fuck himself.

01:34.136 --> 01:37.306
The first of the month,
that was the arrangement.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.515
Will do.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.645
Might not mention the bit
about fucking himself though. Huh?

01:43.729 --> 01:45.355
You know how sensitive he is.

01:48.108 --> 01:53.030
This language school setup,
it fool anyone?

01:53.906 --> 01:57.451
So, now we are having a conversation, huh?

01:58.035 --> 02:00.662
Well, I need to stay
long enough to convince Demetrio

02:00.746 --> 02:04.458
that we discussed the ins and outs
of your financial obligations.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.001
He's outside?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.669
Yeah, he's in the car.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.715
You weren't actually on today's list.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.635
Yeah, we just happened to be passing.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.556
It's busier than it looks. The school.

02:21.183 --> 02:24.102
We get a lot of inquiries.
You'd be surprised.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.606
You'll be surprised
how little that surprises me.

02:29.191 --> 02:32.236
Surely Demetrio will be wondering
where you are.

02:33.529 --> 02:37.449
No. He'll be reading the paper,
scratching his balls.

02:38.617 --> 02:39.993
You know Demetrio.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.120
Not as well as you.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.207
Probably not.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.834
Which is strange, huh?

02:48.252 --> 02:50.128
As I just made him up.

02:51.964 --> 02:55.300
So, if you have finished playing games,

02:55.384 --> 03:01.181
would you mind either fucking off
or telling me what you want, Jackson Lamb?

03:51.899 --> 03:54.443
So, what do you want with me?

03:54.526 --> 03:57.487
A little chat about old times, Nikky.

03:58.488 --> 04:02.743
Everything I knew,
I gave up when I came in from Moscow.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.411
Oh, yeah. I remember.

04:04.953 --> 04:08.123
Yeah, I saw the tape of your debrief.

04:08.207 --> 04:10.375
You-- Couldn't shut you up.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.753
I-- Are there things living in this?

04:12.836 --> 04:16.757
I was fucking nervous, okay?
Walking in as a defector.

04:17.423 --> 04:22.679
Knowing if I don't give you enough,
you throw me back out.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.475
What do you think my side would have done
with a traitor?

04:26.558 --> 04:29.645
The ultimate torture,
made you listen back to yourself.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.314
Do you-- D-- You sleep here as well?

04:32.397 --> 04:33.607
That is grim.

04:35.692 --> 04:36.693
Why are you here?

04:37.319 --> 04:40.113
What is it you want me to talk about?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.325
Cicadas.

04:45.202 --> 04:49.248
Is it really worth locking this place up?
A burglary could improve it.

04:50.916 --> 04:54.419
How do you know me?
I never met you in the field.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.046
I'd have remembered your perfume.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.006
Amongst my fellow exiles,

04:58.507 --> 05:02.052
your name has come up
on more than one occasion.

05:03.679 --> 05:04.721
I'm flattered.

05:05.389 --> 05:08.475
Well, the next time you see
your old KGB mates,

05:08.559 --> 05:10.185
tell them I never think of them.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.396
Not once.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.096
Hey, has anything else come through

05:46.180 --> 05:48.432
on where the bald man went
after he got off the train?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.309
I'm not your PA.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.144
I'm not asking you to get me
a pain au chocolat.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.812
I'm asking for an intel update.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.606
Why do you need an intel update?

05:55.689 --> 05:56.940
Because I'm in the Cotswolds.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.942
Lamb wanted me on the trail
while it was still warm.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.986
So, if there is an update,
it would be handy to know.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.613
So, I am your PA?

06:02.696 --> 06:05.407
Only if it stands for "prickly arsehole."

06:08.869 --> 06:11.997
There is no update.
I told you everything we know earlier.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.666
Bald guy walks towards the taxi office
with a few other passengers.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.836
Some cabs drove off, but it was too dark
to see which, if any, he was in.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.588
Thank you, Shirley.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.758
I'm only telling you so you'll stop
bickering like a pair of absolute cocks.

06:25.761 --> 06:29.056
I don't bicker. I play judo with words.

06:40.192 --> 06:43.445
No worries, Dinah.
Barbek can help you with the bags.

06:43.529 --> 06:47.366
Yes, onto the train. I'll tell him.
I got it all written down now.

06:47.449 --> 06:48.617
All right, then.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.078
Whereto, my love?

06:51.161 --> 06:54.081
Hi. Sorry. Don't actually need a car.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.291
It's a bit of a long shot this,

06:56.375 --> 06:58.961
but I'm actually just trying
to track down my uncle.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.505
He's been a bit erratic
since my aunt died.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.508
He goes walkabout all the time.
It's really quite worrying.

07:05.551 --> 07:09.388
All we know is that he got on a train
two nights ago from Oxford Parkway,

07:09.471 --> 07:11.431
and we just haven't heard from him since.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.101
So, I wondered if he had gotten off here

07:14.184 --> 07:16.478
and maybe come in and ordered a cab.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.273
He's quite distinctive looking.

07:19.356 --> 07:23.443
He's completely bald,
quite a big man, 50s.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.072
I remember.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.575
-Yeah?
-Yeah, quiet night.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.244
Couple of days back,
and he was the last fare.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.204
Oh, thank God.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.874
Do you remember where he went, then?

07:36.957 --> 07:39.501
I do.
He went straight back to Oxford Parkway.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.380
Did he really? Right.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.552
Do you think maybe
I could speak to the driver,

07:48.635 --> 07:50.888
just to double-check
exactly where he dropped him?

07:51.388 --> 07:52.681
Kenny's on a run right now,

07:52.764 --> 07:56.935
but he'll be having his brekkie
in the caff around the corner after.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.604
-Kenny. Right.
-Yeah.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.898
-Thanks very much. Thank you.
-That's all right, love.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.239
So, who are we meeting again?

08:09.323 --> 08:10.991
Should be in your head by now, Min.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.577
No, it is in my head.
I'm just-- I'm testing you.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.495
Nevsky.

08:17.206 --> 08:21.835
Nevsky's representative,
whose name is Russian?

08:21.919 --> 08:23.086
Fuck's sake, Min.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.379
Sorry. It's just--

08:24.463 --> 08:27.674
It's been a while since I've had
to remember anything important, sorry.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.469
Yeah. Pashkin. Arkady Pashkin.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.553
That's who we're meeting.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.679
That's Nevsky's representative, isn't it?

08:33.764 --> 08:37.226
Eventually, but today
we're meeting Pashkin's security.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.270
-Are they in here too?
-Oh, my God.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.355
Okay.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.067
-Piotr.
-Right, yes.

08:45.609 --> 08:49.071
-Kyril, who work for Pashkin…
-Okay. Yes, I get it, yeah.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.323
-…who works for Nevsky. Got it?
-Yes. Yes.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.825
-Need some flash cards? Okay.
-No, thank you. It's fine.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.874
-Where are you going?
-I'm gonna cycle.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.918
Oh, no. Come on, Min, there's no time.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.504
I'll wisp through the traffic.
It's fine. I'll be quick.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.006
Okay. Well, you better not be late.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.843
I won't be late
for old Lenin and Rasputin. Don't worry.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.135
It's all in my head.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.934
So, Sally tells me

09:19.017 --> 09:21.937
that you took my uncle back
to Oxford Parkway two days ago.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.690
I took a lot of people
to Oxford Parkway two days ago.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.282
I get the impression that you're trying
to get me to give you money, Kenny.

09:34.032 --> 09:38.161
That's not very public-spirited of you,
seeing as my uncle is not a well man.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.290
I don't think your uncle wants you
to find him.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.542
So, you did take him
back to Oxford Parkway.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.170
I don't think he's your uncle either.

09:46.753 --> 09:47.963
Right.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.099
Didn't take him to Oxford Parkway.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.852
So, where did you take him, Kenny?

10:10.027 --> 10:11.278
You got more in there?

10:12.821 --> 10:15.532
-How much is this gonna cost?
-Well, that's the thing.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.409
Your uncle, or whatever he is to you,

10:17.492 --> 10:20.454
as soon as he gets in the cab,
he gives me a new destination.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.081
But he pays me the fare
to Oxford Parkway plus a little bit more,

10:23.165 --> 10:25.042
so if someone comes looking,

10:25.125 --> 10:28.003
I'm to tell them
I took him to Oxford Parkway.

10:28.504 --> 10:30.839
So, I'd feel like I was breaking a deal.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.133
-Unless--
-Unless I pay you what he did.

10:33.217 --> 10:34.593
You catch on quick.

10:34.676 --> 10:35.844
And how much was that?

10:35.928 --> 10:37.221
200.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.389
Tw--

10:40.432 --> 10:41.600
Cashpoint over there.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.356
Call it 240, why don't we?

11:10.462 --> 11:13.340
Double Scotch, and a red wine.

11:13.423 --> 11:16.844
House red? Got merlot, cabernet or--

11:16.927 --> 11:20.097
No. The shittiest one. Ta.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.479
Put another one in there.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.483
Cicadas.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.821
Why did you mention them in your debrief?

11:37.239 --> 11:42.327
I thought it was an ace up my sleeve.
But nobody seemed to care.

11:42.411 --> 11:45.789
I want to know
what you would have gone on to say

11:45.873 --> 11:47.791
if they hadn't had lost interest.

11:49.293 --> 11:54.715
I would have told them…
I heard Popov's plans for the cicadas,

11:55.757 --> 11:57.426
from the man himself.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.349
You don't believe me?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.269
Go on then. Talk.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.274
It was an ordinary workday.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.360
Not long before the Wall came down.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.696
I was in the cubicle.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.825
The conversation I overheard was
between two men.

12:22.951 --> 12:27.331
The first one said,
"I don't want my cicadas abandoned.

12:27.414 --> 12:31.376
The funding, the support, must continue."

12:31.460 --> 12:34.588
And the other said, "It will be hard."

12:35.214 --> 12:40.385
Then the first one said,
"Tell them this is from Popov."

12:45.891 --> 12:48.185
-That was it?
-Yeah.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.313
They stepped in, exchanged these words,
stepped out.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.569
What did he look like? Popov and his goon.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.781
I told you. I was in a cubicle.

13:00.864 --> 13:04.034
-I mean, didn't you turn your head?
-It was toilet cubicle.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.912
You overheard all this
while you were taking a shit?

13:06.995 --> 13:08.455
I assume.

13:08.539 --> 13:11.708
That wasn't the memorable part
of the experience.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.919
Did you recognize the voices?

13:14.002 --> 13:16.129
Not the one I took to be Popov.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.508
But the other one was maybe familiar.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.885
But I cannot be sure.

13:22.803 --> 13:23.804
Name?

13:26.723 --> 13:28.350
Andrei Chernitsky.

13:30.602 --> 13:31.979
And what did he look like?

13:32.521 --> 13:33.897
Like a killer.

13:35.023 --> 13:38.861
If you saw his eyes… from a distance too.

13:39.570 --> 13:42.072
A big bull. A big bald bull.

13:55.586 --> 13:56.712
Hey.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.173
-Nice of you to show up.
-Just getting the miles in.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.175
-I said you'd be late.
-Oh, come on.

14:01.258 --> 14:04.219
-I'm here on time, aren't I?
-No, "on time" means 20 minutes early.

14:04.303 --> 14:05.304
-You know that.
-Okay.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.556
I had to do the whole security lap
by myself.

14:07.639 --> 14:08.849
Sorry.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.810
Right, that looks like them.
Piotr and Kyril.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.187
Who are they again?

14:13.270 --> 14:14.646
Not funny.

14:15.689 --> 14:16.690
Okay.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.108
Well, let them come to us.

14:23.739 --> 14:25.991
So, we understand
that Mr. Pashkin arrives tomorrow.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.618
He is in New York right now.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.162
We will liaise with you on security
for the meeting.

14:30.829 --> 14:31.914
You doing a bug sweep?

14:31.997 --> 14:33.665
Yes. We'll do that the day before.

14:33.749 --> 14:36.710
We'll sweep for bugs,
disable the cameras and seal the room.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.795
We will accompany you.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.339
Well, that won't be necessary.

14:41.798 --> 14:42.799
No, it is.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.385
What, you don't trust us?

14:46.178 --> 14:48.347
Look, mister…

14:48.430 --> 14:50.933
-Sorry, I've--
-Harper. It's Min Harper.

14:52.017 --> 14:55.312
You say it like, "Bond. James Bond."

14:55.812 --> 14:57.773
Do all English agents say it like that?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.317
We're with the Department of Energy.

15:01.693 --> 15:02.694
Of course.

15:03.195 --> 15:05.030
Okay,
how about you both put your dicks away?

15:10.827 --> 15:12.955
-Okay, dicks away.
-Great.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.832
And whilst we're about it, no guns either.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.042
Guns?

15:17.125 --> 15:19.586
Yes, like the ones
that you're both carrying now.

15:19.670 --> 15:21.004
We're not carrying guns.

15:23.215 --> 15:25.384
You can come on the bug sweep.
But no guns.

15:28.053 --> 15:31.723
And after the sweep, you will present
a report to Mr. Pashkin in his hotel.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.725
Which hotel?

15:33.809 --> 15:35.143
Ambassador.

15:35.853 --> 15:37.437
What, you guys staying there too?

15:39.189 --> 15:42.609
Once Mr. Pashkin arrives,
we'll join him in The Ambassador, yes.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.194
But for now?

15:47.656 --> 15:50.993
Excelsior, Excalibur. Something like that.

15:51.076 --> 15:53.537
Forgive me. I'm very stupid with names.

15:54.663 --> 15:57.958
Well, good luck driving around every hotel
in London beginning with "E."

16:00.127 --> 16:02.713
You, I like you. You're funny.

16:04.256 --> 16:05.841
Don't forget to let us know which hotel--

16:05.924 --> 16:09.136
Of course. Is it possible
to get a taxi from here?

16:09.761 --> 16:12.347
Yeah. There's a taxi rank just
in the corner over there.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.850
Lovely to meet you.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.360
-Well, I don't trust them.
-You're not supposed to.

16:25.444 --> 16:26.778
It's part of the game.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.364
Min, all that matters is
that we do our job.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.955
-What are you doing, Min?
-Doing my job.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.993
Sorry! I'm sorry!

19:14.404 --> 19:15.614
I saw you.

19:16.532 --> 19:19.409
You got here first
then left to keep me waiting.

19:19.493 --> 19:22.996
Well, that's because I knew
you were watching and waiting

19:23.080 --> 19:24.915
so you could arrive after me.

19:25.999 --> 19:29.378
What a pair we are. Made for each other.

19:32.506 --> 19:35.759
If this bench marks my coat,
I'm going to send you the cleaning bill.

19:35.843 --> 19:37.469
You can get coats cleaned?

19:37.553 --> 19:38.554
Yeah.

19:38.637 --> 19:43.517
Coats cleaned, teeth fixed, hair washed.

19:44.101 --> 19:45.978
I know it's news for you.

19:46.562 --> 19:47.729
I've been busy lately.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.691
It's possible I've let myself go.

19:54.528 --> 19:56.363
What do you want with Nikolai Katinsky?

19:57.948 --> 19:59.908
Did he go crying to Mummy?

20:00.576 --> 20:02.244
Promise I didn't hurt him.

20:02.327 --> 20:05.539
Although I'm not sure all that booze
I bought him did him much good.

20:05.622 --> 20:06.748
You can talk.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.837
I wanted to go over
a few points from his debrief.

20:14.006 --> 20:15.799
That was almost 20 years ago.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.304
Katinsky was from the shallow end.

20:20.971 --> 20:24.808
No information that we didn't have already
from other reliable sources.

20:25.642 --> 20:28.187
We were only hanging on to him
because of the swaps.

20:32.316 --> 20:34.610
Dickie Bough dropped dead the other night.

20:34.693 --> 20:35.527
I know.

20:36.486 --> 20:40.199
Dogs went over it.
It is what it looked like.

20:41.158 --> 20:45.120
Old drunk drops dead. Cautionary tale.

20:46.038 --> 20:49.875
Well, he left a note on his phone. Cicada.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.126
Jesus.

20:51.210 --> 20:55.297
Now the only ex-KGB to offer us anything
on cicadas was Katinsky.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.175
Cicadas was a nonsense.

20:58.258 --> 21:03.096
Katinsky overheard someone talking
about cicadas, back in Moscow.

21:03.180 --> 21:06.225
About keeping them in place
after the fall.

21:06.808 --> 21:09.019
That someone was Popov.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.562
Popov was a nonsense.

21:10.646 --> 21:13.232
Now, the person talking to Popov

21:13.982 --> 21:18.904
matches the description
of the person I think killed Dickie Bough.

21:43.387 --> 21:44.388
What?

21:44.471 --> 21:47.057
I thought you were Billy Big Bollocks
tracking a murderer.

21:47.641 --> 21:50.102
What you doing at a cashpoint?
You off to a strip club?

21:59.027 --> 22:00.195
How did you find me?

22:00.279 --> 22:01.864
Service phones are trackable.

22:01.947 --> 22:03.365
Okay, why did you find me?

22:03.448 --> 22:04.533
Bored.

22:04.616 --> 22:07.077
'Cause he's got a mental age of seven.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.996
I'm paying the taxi driver
because he knows something.

22:09.079 --> 22:10.831
Knows how to spot a sucker.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.375
Brilliant. Okay, bye now, Roddy.

22:13.458 --> 22:17.045
Keep up the vital work shitting
on everyone else from the sidelines.

22:28.932 --> 22:30.392
What were you gonna say?

22:30.475 --> 22:33.103
I was gonna flame him
with a blitzkrieg of zingers.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.907
Is that a second breakfast?

22:44.990 --> 22:46.617
Well, you were taking your time.

22:49.828 --> 22:51.872
Right. Where did you drop him?

22:51.955 --> 22:53.165
Upshott.

22:53.248 --> 22:54.541
What's "Upshott"?

22:54.625 --> 22:56.835
Couple of hundred houses,
a church, and a pub.

22:56.919 --> 22:59.296
-Right. Where in Upshott?
-Church.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.673
Did he meet anyone?

23:01.757 --> 23:03.217
Not that I saw.

23:03.300 --> 23:06.136
Well, did he get in a car? Did you see him
go in a house? What did he do?

23:06.220 --> 23:08.430
Once he's paid the fare
and got out the cab, I lose interest.

23:08.514 --> 23:10.557
Well, you might have seen something
as you drove off.

23:10.641 --> 23:11.642
Well, I didn't.

23:14.895 --> 23:15.896
Who is he?

23:16.480 --> 23:18.065
How'd he know you was coming
to look for him?

23:18.148 --> 23:19.191
He's my uncle.

23:26.156 --> 23:31.328
I am trying to deal with 100,000 people
marching to shut down the city

23:31.411 --> 23:33.372
and a Home Secretary
who wants them to riot,

23:33.455 --> 23:35.332
so he can go big on law and order.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.751
I do not need you digging around the past.

23:37.835 --> 23:42.130
Well, it's not really the past, Diana.
Is it? Dickie's lying on a slab right now.

23:42.214 --> 23:45.008
-Well, what was Dickie to you?
-Nothing.

23:45.092 --> 23:47.094
I didn't even like
the grubby little fucker.

23:47.177 --> 23:48.554
But that's not the point.

23:49.471 --> 23:53.183
He was a joe,
and that counts for something.

23:53.267 --> 23:54.935
Not to you and the stiffs at the Park.

23:55.018 --> 23:57.145
But I'm gonna get
the bastard that got him.

23:57.229 --> 23:59.147
And how do you think you're gonna do that?

23:59.231 --> 24:02.901
You don't have the resources or the budget
to run an op from Slough House.

24:03.569 --> 24:07.531
-No. But you're gonna approve one.
-Why?

24:09.449 --> 24:13.453
Well, for one thing,
your boy Spider's been poaching my team,

24:13.537 --> 24:18.292
and I feel I'm owed
payment in kind for that.

24:19.710 --> 24:21.670
Not that the two in question
are worth shit,

24:21.753 --> 24:23.255
but you understand the principle.

24:23.338 --> 24:26.341
Do you seriously think
I'm gonna let you go live

24:26.425 --> 24:30.470
just because Webb is using one of,
what you call, your shit horses?

24:31.096 --> 24:32.806
I need a workable cover, Diana.

24:32.890 --> 24:34.349
I can put one together myself,

24:34.433 --> 24:37.311
but it will take a week or two,
and I need it now.

24:37.811 --> 24:41.190
I also need a-- an operating fund.

24:42.107 --> 24:44.109
I don't know. A couple of K should do it.

24:45.903 --> 24:47.029
You owe me.

24:50.115 --> 24:52.701
I do this and it's done and dusted…

24:52.784 --> 24:54.828
-Absolutely.
-Right?

24:54.912 --> 24:56.496
Wipe the slate clean.

25:01.168 --> 25:03.170
You might wanna wipe
your coat while you're at it.

25:03.253 --> 25:06.131
I think you sat in some bird shit.

25:33.033 --> 25:35.035
It's Kenny from the taxi.

25:35.118 --> 25:37.496
Someone showed.
I told them the church like you said.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.872
Now send me my money.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.168
Who'd you call, Kenny?

25:43.252 --> 25:44.336
Who you--

25:44.419 --> 25:45.712
Oh, fuck.

25:54.555 --> 25:55.556
What the f--

25:58.100 --> 25:59.476
Don't you fucking dare.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.311
Okay, Kenny…

26:02.521 --> 26:04.439
you're really starting to piss me off now.

26:04.523 --> 26:05.566
So let's make this quick.

26:06.525 --> 26:08.277
Either I choke you till you pass out,

26:08.777 --> 26:11.446
or I can make you throw up
all over your lovely taxi.

26:11.530 --> 26:13.115
Or you could just open your mouth.

26:15.909 --> 26:16.952
Good choice.

26:22.124 --> 26:25.127
You're a greedy man, Kenny.
Two breakfasts and this.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.630
Right. So would you like to tell me
where you dropped him?

26:30.632 --> 26:32.301
I took him to an airfield.

26:32.384 --> 26:33.927
Is that the truth?

26:34.011 --> 26:35.053
Yes.

26:37.472 --> 26:38.473
Okay.

26:41.518 --> 26:43.353
-Let's go there then.
-Fuck.

26:43.437 --> 26:45.647
Oh, shut up.
Just breathe in and out, in and out.

26:45.731 --> 26:47.107
You'll be fine. Let's go.

26:51.445 --> 26:55.616
So, it was the same guy on this number
that you drove to the Flying Club?

26:55.699 --> 26:57.618
I don't know. I left a message.

26:58.243 --> 27:01.496
He told me if someone showed
and challenged the Oxford Parkway story,

27:01.580 --> 27:03.123
I should tell them
I dropped him at the church,

27:03.207 --> 27:04.374
and they'd pay me some more money.

27:05.209 --> 27:07.419
Right. How much?
And how were they gonna pay you?

27:08.003 --> 27:10.088
500 quid. Via PayPal.

27:10.589 --> 27:15.427
F-- Well, that account will be linked
to a fake ID.

27:15.511 --> 27:16.970
That will be impossible to trace.

27:18.388 --> 27:19.515
What are you?

27:20.140 --> 27:21.225
A copper?

27:22.100 --> 27:24.269
Don't worry. I'm one of the goodies,
if that's what you're asking.

27:24.353 --> 27:25.604
I'm not gonna hurt you.

27:28.065 --> 27:31.777
The bald man, on the other hand,
not so sure.

27:44.498 --> 27:47.084
-Would you like a beverage, sir?
-No, he wouldn't. Thank you.

27:52.089 --> 27:53.131
Slow Horses.

27:53.215 --> 27:54.550
What have you heard?

27:55.050 --> 27:57.386
Well, nothing from you.

27:57.469 --> 27:59.972
-They're handy for deniability.
-So are you.

28:01.181 --> 28:03.392
Maybe I should send you to Slough House.

28:04.893 --> 28:07.813
I've been putting something together.

28:07.896 --> 28:11.275
I've used the Slow Horses to insulate you.
I think you'll like it.

28:11.859 --> 28:13.235
Making it sound like a surprise party.

28:13.318 --> 28:15.320
I hate surprises,
and I don't like parties.

28:15.904 --> 28:19.366
I've been exploring
the possibility of a meet

28:20.075 --> 28:21.952
between you and Ilya Nevsky.

28:26.498 --> 28:27.541
Right.

28:29.293 --> 28:31.378
Nevsky is off-limits.
You should know that.

28:31.461 --> 28:32.838
We have an arrangement with Moscow.

28:32.921 --> 28:34.673
We don't engage with him.
They don't kill him.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.341
So I imagine you have a good reason

28:36.425 --> 28:39.261
for wanting to destabilize
international relations.

28:41.471 --> 28:42.890
We hedge our bets.

28:43.724 --> 28:46.476
We don't wanna needlessly antagonize
the current regime

28:46.560 --> 28:48.478
by cozying up to one of its major critics.

28:48.562 --> 28:53.108
But equally, we don't want
a President Nevsky one day taking power

28:53.817 --> 28:56.403
with a grudge against Britain
'cause we never helped him.

28:57.112 --> 28:58.947
We've stopped them
from seizing his assets.

28:59.031 --> 29:01.533
-He should be grateful for that.
-And I know he appreciates that.

29:01.617 --> 29:05.621
He's just wondering if we might do more
to bring about change.

29:06.830 --> 29:07.915
How do you know this?

29:07.998 --> 29:11.335
I was approached by a cutout

29:12.252 --> 29:15.589
who put me in touch
with Nevsky's number two, Arkady Pashkin.

29:16.632 --> 29:18.926
-We're meeting on Saturday.
-Who else knows?

29:19.009 --> 29:20.552
-Nobody.
-Harper? Guy?

29:20.636 --> 29:22.638
All they know is they're running security.

29:25.599 --> 29:26.683
Keep going.

29:28.101 --> 29:32.314
I want regular updates.
All the details. Good and bad.

29:32.397 --> 29:33.524
Of course.

29:33.607 --> 29:37.027
And if the Slow Horses misbehave,
you can send them back to Lamb.

29:38.111 --> 29:39.446
Only you can go with them.

29:42.199 --> 29:43.200
Ma'am.

29:55.212 --> 29:57.089
Bit out of our price range, I'd say.

29:58.090 --> 30:00.551
Unless we sell a couple of kidneys--
Your kidneys.

30:01.885 --> 30:03.220
-You're such a--
-What?

30:04.304 --> 30:06.265
-Hello, you. Hello?
-Yeah, what?

30:06.348 --> 30:08.308
Is this 'cause I went off
and followed them?

30:08.392 --> 30:09.643
'Cause they didn't spot me.

30:09.726 --> 30:11.687
Did you find out where they were going?

30:12.604 --> 30:14.481
No. Not exactly.

30:14.565 --> 30:16.692
So you could have just been killed
for nothing then.

30:17.401 --> 30:18.485
I was on my bicycle.

30:18.569 --> 30:20.654
Anyway, I smashed my calorie burn
by mid-morning.

30:20.737 --> 30:23.073
-That's not funny. Not funny anymore.
-I'm not saying it was.

30:23.156 --> 30:25.951
Thousands of people cycle in London
every day. They don't all get killed.

30:26.034 --> 30:28.829
Most of them aren't middle-aged idiots
trying to prove a point, are they?

30:29.496 --> 30:30.539
Anyway, I proved my point

30:30.622 --> 30:32.958
because the reason they mumbled
the name of the hotel is

30:33.041 --> 30:36.253
'cause they're staying in a doss house
on the Edgware Road.

30:36.336 --> 30:38.130
You don't know for sure.
You said you lost them.

30:38.213 --> 30:41.049
Well, okay, but thereabouts.

30:41.633 --> 30:42.759
Who lives here then?

30:43.260 --> 30:44.845
Ilya Nevsky. Here.

30:44.928 --> 30:47.139
The boss of the guy
that Spider's gonna meet.

30:47.639 --> 30:49.766
So whilst you were having
your little midlife crisis,

30:49.850 --> 30:51.894
I decided to do some actual work.

30:52.394 --> 30:54.271
Okay. Pretend we're looking at maps.

30:56.273 --> 30:57.774
Over there, back there maybe?

30:57.858 --> 30:59.860
-I think it was that way.
-I think it's this way.

30:59.943 --> 31:01.612
I don't think Spider would want us here.

31:01.695 --> 31:03.697
Spider asked us
to run background security.

31:03.780 --> 31:06.992
I'm running background security.
I want to see how paranoid he is.

31:07.075 --> 31:08.285
Which is very.

31:10.579 --> 31:12.623
God, if you were that security-conscious,

31:12.706 --> 31:15.459
and wanted a secret meeting,
would you go through a guy like Webb?

31:15.542 --> 31:19.463
It is under the radar, isn't it?
It's not going through the usual channels.

31:21.381 --> 31:23.383
All right. Can you not tear off
like that again, please?

31:23.467 --> 31:24.468
I won't.

31:28.222 --> 31:30.766
-How much further then?
-'Bout half a mile.

31:32.851 --> 31:36.480
So did he say anything else, our man,
or did he just give you instructions?

31:36.563 --> 31:37.773
What, like small talk?

31:37.856 --> 31:39.149
-Yes.
-No.

31:42.569 --> 31:44.821
-What accent did he have?
-I don't know!

31:44.905 --> 31:47.824
-Polish, maybe.
-Right. Polish specifically?

31:47.908 --> 31:49.409
All right, Czech then.

31:51.286 --> 31:54.039
Jesus Chri-- There is a difference,
you know.

31:54.122 --> 31:57.084
-Well, I'm not an expert, am I?
-No. No way.

32:17.813 --> 32:19.356
Right, so he got on a plane?

32:20.649 --> 32:21.775
I don't know.

32:23.694 --> 32:27.197
-What do you mean you don't know?
-He got out and went into the club.

32:28.574 --> 32:30.993
-And did he meet anyone in there?
-Don't know.

32:32.035 --> 32:34.913
There's that "don't know" again.
It's really annoying.

32:35.914 --> 32:37.165
Who did he meet?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.711
There was a car parked up.
It could have been his.

32:42.087 --> 32:44.965
Right.
Did you get a make of the car or a plate?

32:45.048 --> 32:48.760
I didn't take much notice.
I was texting my missus.

32:48.844 --> 32:51.680
Telling her I was calling in sick
the next day as I'd had a windfall.

32:53.682 --> 32:56.852
-Right, how far is Upshott from here?
-About two miles that way.

32:58.478 --> 32:59.479
Okay.

33:00.189 --> 33:01.190
Here.

33:01.273 --> 33:03.066
You're not going to speak to my wife,
are you?

33:03.817 --> 33:05.277
Why? What else have you done?

33:06.820 --> 33:08.572
I told her it was less that I got.

33:10.699 --> 33:12.367
Blew a couple of hundred on the dogs.

33:13.118 --> 33:16.705
Still, I made that back off you.

33:24.630 --> 33:25.672
Right.

33:26.507 --> 33:29.176
Well, you can stay here
and take me back to the station after.

33:30.469 --> 33:31.553
For free.

33:44.566 --> 33:48.362
Roddy. Can you trace a mobile number?

33:48.445 --> 33:49.947
Well, obviously.

33:50.864 --> 33:53.200
I think I've got Dickie's killer's number.

33:54.451 --> 33:55.452
I'm waiting.

33:56.161 --> 34:01.500
Right, it's 0700-900-917.

34:05.504 --> 34:07.673
Well, what you got there
is a missing digit.

34:08.507 --> 34:10.759
Can you check it's not the one
stuck up your arse?

34:10.842 --> 34:12.844
No, it's not missing. It just-- It…

34:13.637 --> 34:14.888
It got a bit smudged, all right?

34:14.972 --> 34:19.935
So that's 07 and then, yeah,
that could be a one or a seven.

34:20.018 --> 34:21.687
So just run both of them.

34:21.770 --> 34:23.730
Get out of my ear,
and I'll get back to you.

34:54.136 --> 34:55.554
Did he say whose number it was?

34:55.637 --> 34:59.349
-Sorry, who are you again?
-That's Lamb's joke. Dick.

34:59.433 --> 35:01.268
Roddy, could we hurry this along?

35:03.770 --> 35:06.023
-Guess where the phone is.
-Estonia.

35:08.192 --> 35:09.193
Hey.

35:09.276 --> 35:11.028
-He's in Estonia.
-All right.

35:11.111 --> 35:14.364
Well, I think I know how he got there.
I'm at Upshott Flying Club.

35:17.492 --> 35:18.702
Hold on. I'll ring you back.

35:24.208 --> 35:25.209
Kenny--

35:36.637 --> 35:37.804
Oh, fuck.

36:05.624 --> 36:07.292
Yes, you've got lovely abs.

36:07.376 --> 36:09.002
-You think?
-Yeah.

36:09.086 --> 36:10.587
Why, thank you.

36:11.088 --> 36:12.589
What do you wanna order for dinner?

36:14.466 --> 36:16.260
Shit. Sorry--

36:16.343 --> 36:17.344
What?

36:17.427 --> 36:21.974
Well, I can't 'cause I promised Lucas
I'd take him for dinner tonight.

36:24.476 --> 36:25.727
Are you joking?

36:25.811 --> 36:28.063
No. I'm allowed to see my son, aren't I?

36:28.939 --> 36:31.149
Yes, you're allowed to see your son.
Don't do that.

36:31.233 --> 36:33.944
But we're supposed to be working.
We've got the bug sweep tomorrow.

36:34.444 --> 36:36.864
I know. But, it's fine. It will be fine.

36:36.947 --> 36:38.866
-I did tell you.
-No, you didn't tell me.

36:38.949 --> 36:42.035
And I don't want it just to be fine.
I want it to be perfect.

36:42.119 --> 36:44.454
-I really did tell you.
-Then how come I can't remember?

36:44.538 --> 36:47.833
-Well, perhaps you've forgotten.
-Really? I'm the one that forgets things?

36:47.916 --> 36:50.878
Oh, really? That's quite boring,
the whole "Min forgets things" shit.

36:50.961 --> 36:53.088
No, I'm sorry.
This is actually fucking annoying.

36:53.172 --> 36:54.965
It's been ages
since I've done a bug sweep,

36:55.048 --> 36:57.342
you've probably never done one,
and we need to brush up.

36:57.426 --> 36:59.428
Well, I thought we already did brush up?

36:59.511 --> 37:02.181
Oh, fuck off. You deliberately didn't
tell me you were going out later

37:02.264 --> 37:03.932
so I'd still have sex with you. Come on.

37:04.516 --> 37:05.642
I mean, you're crediting me

37:05.726 --> 37:07.978
with a level of calculation
I do not possess.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.106
Okay, sure. Yeah. You're an instinct man.

37:11.190 --> 37:12.482
Like when you took off on your bicycle

37:12.566 --> 37:15.569
because a bodyguard couldn't remember
the name of his hotel.

37:15.652 --> 37:17.321
-I was being professional.
-No, you weren't.

37:17.404 --> 37:19.740
You were being a dick,
and it could have cost us the detail.

37:19.823 --> 37:21.992
Right. Well, I don't even know
if I wanna do this detail.

37:22.075 --> 37:24.077
I don't know if I wanna work for Spider.

37:24.786 --> 37:27.164
So you'd rather stay at Slough House
working for Lamb?

37:27.789 --> 37:30.250
That's you all over.
Take the easy way out.

37:30.334 --> 37:33.212
-Slough House isn't easy.
-You do what you wanna do.

37:33.295 --> 37:34.963
I'm not gonna end my career
at Slough House.

37:35.047 --> 37:36.798
Did I say I want to end my career
at Slough House?

37:36.882 --> 37:38.926
You said you preferred
to stay there than work for Spider.

37:39.009 --> 37:41.178
No, I said I didn't know
if I wanted to work for Spider.

37:41.261 --> 37:42.971
I don't know what I said.
Why are we arguing?

37:43.055 --> 37:45.140
Because you're going out
when we should be working.

37:45.224 --> 37:47.601
You're being a bit ridiculous.
I'm not going to see another woman.

37:47.684 --> 37:50.103
-I'm taking my son out.
-As if you could get another woman.

37:51.522 --> 37:53.440
Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

37:53.524 --> 37:56.276
-Didn't mean it.
-Look, fair enough.

37:56.360 --> 37:59.238
I can come back later,
and we can work on this.

37:59.321 --> 38:02.407
Or maybe it's best
I just stay at mine tonight.

38:03.909 --> 38:07.287
-Yeah, okay. Whatever you think is best.
-Right. Bye.

38:13.460 --> 38:15.337
River said he flew from Upshott.

38:15.420 --> 38:18.090
I've checked the radar logs.
Not at that time and date he didn't.

38:18.173 --> 38:19.174
He flew commercial.

38:19.258 --> 38:23.011
It must have been a morning flight.
Heathrow's closest.

38:23.095 --> 38:25.973
-Stay in your lane, Standish.
-Sorry?

38:26.974 --> 38:29.768
I'll track him. Relax.
You do your thing, and I'll do mine.

38:30.894 --> 38:33.981
My thing being making sure
there's enough tea and bin liners

38:34.064 --> 38:36.525
and handing out tasks
you think I couldn't do myself?

38:36.608 --> 38:37.776
I didn't wanna say it.

38:37.860 --> 38:40.696
Fuck's sake, Ho. Who tracked
Dickie Bough's killer on the CCTV?

38:40.779 --> 38:42.281
The CCTV I hacked?

38:42.364 --> 38:45.409
But you couldn't decipher what was on it
'cause that would involve reading people.

38:45.492 --> 38:48.078
-She did that.
-She got lucky. She's not an agent.

38:48.161 --> 38:50.581
She's been around enough agents.
She knows what she's talking about.

38:51.206 --> 38:52.583
First flight out to Estonia

38:52.666 --> 38:55.544
was nine hours
after he was dropped off at Upshott.

38:55.627 --> 38:59.089
Pull up CCTV footage
of all flight check-in desks to Estonia.

39:32.623 --> 39:34.416
Hello, buddy. Where are you?

39:39.713 --> 39:41.924
Your mum's right. You do need
to get that finished, don't you?

39:42.007 --> 39:44.009
So, that's okay.

39:45.511 --> 39:46.720
Yeah, well, let's speak tomorrow then.

39:48.013 --> 39:49.139
Okay, I love--

40:49.575 --> 40:51.118
You took your time.

40:51.201 --> 40:53.912
Yeah. Well, I had to walk five miles.
Thanks very much.

40:55.330 --> 40:57.082
At least this time you've finished eating.

41:00.544 --> 41:02.462
-Unlucky.
-Great.

41:05.382 --> 41:06.383
So what have you got?

41:08.510 --> 41:10.721
Well, whatever his name is,

41:10.804 --> 41:13.223
Dickie Bough's killer is now actually
in Estonia.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.935
But before he left,
he made contact in Upshott.

41:18.437 --> 41:20.898
-Who with?
-Don't really know yet,

41:20.981 --> 41:22.774
but it's definitely someone
at the Flying Club.

41:22.858 --> 41:24.359
And how do you know all this?

41:25.027 --> 41:28.238
Well, he paid a taxi driver to cover
for him, but I managed to break him.

41:28.322 --> 41:30.949
I got the number that he gave him,
which is now showing in Estonia.

41:31.033 --> 41:32.826
So he knew someone would come looking.

41:33.452 --> 41:35.787
And he took steps to cover his trail too.

41:37.372 --> 41:39.791
Or he wanted the trail found.

41:41.502 --> 41:42.836
How'd you jump to that?

41:42.920 --> 41:45.297
Because if you uncovered the trail
that quickly,

41:45.380 --> 41:47.466
it couldn't have been that well-hidden.

41:48.008 --> 41:49.009
Thanks.

41:52.054 --> 41:53.430
So he kills Dickie…

41:55.224 --> 41:58.602
in a way that doesn't even
raise an eyebrow from the authorities,

41:58.685 --> 42:00.103
but gets my attention.

42:00.687 --> 42:02.064
But then he takes a taxi.

42:03.482 --> 42:05.943
He could've hired a car with a fake ID

42:06.026 --> 42:07.569
or, better still, stolen one.

42:08.278 --> 42:09.321
Feels clumsy.

42:10.155 --> 42:12.199
Why'd you think
he'd wanna get your attention?

42:13.158 --> 42:14.368
I don't know.

42:15.702 --> 42:19.540
Sometimes the only way to work out
why a trap has been set

42:19.623 --> 42:20.958
is to walk into it.

42:26.171 --> 42:29.216
Hope you've had your jabs.
I'm putting you in the field.

42:29.800 --> 42:30.801
Estonia?

42:31.426 --> 42:34.805
You're not going to fucking Estonia.

42:34.888 --> 42:36.348
You're going back to Upshott.

42:37.140 --> 42:39.059
Find out who he spoke to
at the Flying Club.

42:39.142 --> 42:41.019
Find out if they're a cicada.

42:42.980 --> 42:46.275
Here's your motor.
Change of clothes are in the boot.

42:47.609 --> 42:51.196
Here's your shiny new ID,
cover story, funding package, and dossier.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.782
Do not fucking lose it.

42:53.866 --> 42:58.245
I had to swear undying allegiance
to Darth Taverner to wangle that.

43:00.956 --> 43:03.500
Dickie's killer's name is
Andrei Chernitsky?

43:05.544 --> 43:06.795
You already knew.

43:07.629 --> 43:09.131
Yeah, cour-- of course I knew.

43:10.132 --> 43:12.467
Well, who's Nikolai Katinsky then?

43:12.551 --> 43:14.219
Old KGB grind.

43:15.345 --> 43:16.847
Came in after the fall.

43:17.848 --> 43:19.099
He gave me Chernitsky.

43:20.142 --> 43:23.437
Also has the added distinction
of being the only other human being,

43:23.520 --> 43:25.022
apart from the late Dickie Bough,

43:25.105 --> 43:28.233
who claims to have seen Alexander Popov.

43:30.861 --> 43:31.945
It's all in there.

43:42.414 --> 43:43.415
What?

43:45.209 --> 43:46.210
It's exciting.

43:48.670 --> 43:50.255
From Upshott with love.

44:56.864 --> 45:01.285
You know, "cicada" was a term
for a sleeper

45:01.368 --> 45:03.161
on the dark side of the Wall.

45:04.288 --> 45:06.582
On our side, we called them dead lions.

45:07.124 --> 45:08.667
But why now though?

45:09.209 --> 45:13.297
That's what I don't understand.
Why, you know, stay asleep this long?

45:13.380 --> 45:15.632
Yeah, they play a long game, the Russians.

45:16.842 --> 45:19.887
Have an incredible capacity
for pain and sacrifice…

45:21.555 --> 45:22.723
and grudges.

45:24.600 --> 45:25.893
Fuckers never quit.

45:27.769 --> 45:30.355
Check out this Flying Club business, yeah?

45:31.523 --> 45:32.691
Yeah, I already did.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.360
Man who owns it is a Duncan Tropper.

45:36.111 --> 45:38.322
But he's got no known relatives
beyond grandparents.

45:38.405 --> 45:42.034
So, kinda feels to me
like a classic red flag for a legend.

45:42.659 --> 45:44.077
Well, it used to be.

45:44.578 --> 45:47.956
I mean, the more blanks,
the more suspicious it is.

45:49.333 --> 45:53.378
I don't know,
maybe this feels too suspicious.

45:55.339 --> 45:58.717
-What does that actually mean?
-Well, maybe he's expecting you.

46:01.303 --> 46:02.679
All right, come on. Let's move.

46:02.763 --> 46:05.224
I don't wanna be stuck out here
all fucking night.

46:08.268 --> 46:10.604
-You want me to drive you back to London?
-No, thank you.

46:10.687 --> 46:12.856
I am not spending two hours
in a motor with you.

46:12.940 --> 46:14.566
You can drop me at the station.

46:15.776 --> 46:17.152
Right.

46:48.934 --> 46:49.935
Fuck.

47:09.997 --> 47:12.624
Mr. Harper,
I think you're following me, yes?

47:13.709 --> 47:16.003
I was just-- I just--

47:16.086 --> 47:19.214
You just what?
You need more time to think up a story?

47:21.091 --> 47:23.218
Do you feel what I have against your neck?

47:26.972 --> 47:29.224
We have this proverb in Russia…

47:30.517 --> 47:33.645
"A man who sticks his nose
where it is not wanted

47:34.688 --> 47:36.607
gets his head blown off."
