00:02.235 --> 00:04.671
- PREVIOUSLY ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:04.704 --> 00:05.739
- I KNOW I'M THE NEW KID
ON THE BLOCK,

00:05.772 --> 00:07.273
SO I HAVE TO GET CREATIVE.

00:07.307 --> 00:10.010
[speaking Spanish]

00:10.043 --> 00:11.344
- HELLO.

00:11.378 --> 00:12.512
YOU DO NOT STEAL<i>MY</i>CLIENTS.

00:12.545 --> 00:14.214
I STEAL<i>YOUR</i>CLIENTS.

00:14.247 --> 00:15.482
- DON'T BE A [bleep] DICKHEAD.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.384
- WITH MARBLE HOUSE,
FAILING IS NOT AN OPTION.

00:17.417 --> 00:19.753
- THEY'RE NOT CERTAIN THEY
WANT TO BE BELOW CANAL.

00:19.786 --> 00:21.388
- I'M CERTAIN THEY WANT TO BE
BELOW CANAL.

00:21.421 --> 00:23.790
- ESPECIALLY WITH THE STORM.

00:23.823 --> 00:25.892
- DOWNTOWN IS IN A STATE
OF EMERGENCY.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.327
[siren wails]

00:27.360 --> 00:28.795
- [bleep]!

00:28.828 --> 00:30.296
- I'M HAPPY TO SURVIVE
THE STORM.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.631
AT THE SAME TIME,
THE ONLY THING

00:31.664 --> 00:35.669
THAT I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS THE MARBLE HOUSE.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.004
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
NO, NO, NO.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.839
I AM DEVASTATED.

00:39.873 --> 00:43.043
[upbeat music]

00:43.076 --> 00:44.544
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION...

00:44.577 --> 00:48.415
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:48.448 --> 00:51.484
- NEW YORK CITY, IT'S THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

00:51.518 --> 00:53.386
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.989
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:56.022 --> 00:58.558
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:58.591 --> 00:59.893
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE DISRESPECTED ME, BRO.

00:59.926 --> 01:01.327
- HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE?

01:01.361 --> 01:03.730
- I WANTED THIS THING MORE THAN
ANYBODY ELSE, AND YOU KNEW IT!

01:03.763 --> 01:05.065
- IT'S OVER!

01:05.065 --> 01:09.302
* *

01:15.408 --> 01:16.743
- GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
RYAN.

01:16.776 --> 01:18.311
- YEAH, MAN.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.080
- HOW'D YOU DO
AFTER THE STORM?

01:20.113 --> 01:21.448
- IT WAS, UH...

01:21.481 --> 01:23.316
I'M JUST GLAD
TO BE BACK TO WORK.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.085
THE HURRICANE IS OVER,

01:25.118 --> 01:29.255
AND TOO MUCH TIME ALONE
IS A BAD THING FOR RYAN.

01:29.289 --> 01:31.791
THIS THING IS AWESOME.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.693
EVERYONE NOW
IS IN FULL SWING,

01:33.727 --> 01:36.863
AND SINCE I SPEND
TOO MUCH TIME IN TRAFFIC,

01:36.896 --> 01:39.099
NEW INVENTION--
MOBILE OFFICE.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.534
[gasps] OH, MY GOD,
DON'T YOU DO THAT!

01:41.568 --> 01:43.103
I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF LIKE
JAMES BOND.

01:43.136 --> 01:44.270
THIS IS THE GREATEST THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.673
[cell phone rings]
UHH! OFFICE!

01:46.706 --> 01:48.108
[clears throat]
HELLO?

01:48.108 --> 01:49.542
- HEY, RYAN,
IT'S OLIVIA.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.578
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:55.749 --> 01:59.552
90 WILLIAM,
IN THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT?

01:59.586 --> 02:02.055
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SIZE IT IS OR,
LIKE, WHAT KIND OF PRICE?

02:03.656 --> 02:07.193
OH. 1--OH, I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT TO DO THAT.

02:07.227 --> 02:09.295
CAN YOU PUT SOMEONE
FROM THE TEAM ON IT?

02:17.937 --> 02:19.272
OH.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.840
WELL, IF SHE NEEDS TO SELL

02:20.874 --> 02:22.308
AND THEN SHE NEEDS TO BUY,

02:22.342 --> 02:24.744
THAT'S TWO DEALS
AND TWO COMMISSIONS,

02:24.778 --> 02:27.580
AND YOU CARRY THE FOUR,
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

02:27.614 --> 02:28.581
OKAY, JUST MAKE SURE I HAVE
EVERYTHING READY

02:28.615 --> 02:29.649
TO GO IN THE MORNING,

02:29.683 --> 02:31.584
AND THE MOBILE OFFICE

02:31.618 --> 02:32.585
IS HAVING A LITTLE BIT
OF AN ISSUE.

02:32.619 --> 02:34.120
LOAD!

02:34.154 --> 02:36.289
COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT,
MOBILE OFFICE!

02:41.861 --> 02:43.096
[knock at door]

02:43.129 --> 02:44.664
- YEAH?
- ZHANN.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.732
- LUIS.
- YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

02:45.765 --> 02:47.100
HOW ARE YOU?

02:47.100 --> 02:48.668
ZHANN IS MY BOSS.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.171
HE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
EXECUTIVES IN THE COMPANY,

02:51.204 --> 02:52.339
BUT HE'S SOMEONE
THAT I ALSO ADMIRE

02:52.372 --> 02:54.541
AND RESPECT AND LOOK UP TO.

02:54.574 --> 02:57.711
I SEEK HIS APPROVAL
VERY MUCH.

02:57.744 --> 02:58.912
- SO, THERE'S SOMETHING I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

02:58.945 --> 03:01.581
WE HAVE, UM,
THERE'S A LISTING.

03:01.614 --> 03:03.383
THERE'S A LISTING DOWNTOWN
THAT I THINK,

03:03.416 --> 03:04.751
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GET YOU
IN FRONT OF THE SELLER.

03:04.784 --> 03:06.152
- OKAY.
WHERE IS IT LOCATED?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.054
- UH,
IT'S ON DOWNING STREET.

03:08.088 --> 03:10.423
- IN THE WEST VILLAGE?
- YEAH. WEST VILLAGE.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.926
IT'S A TOWNHOUSE.
REALLY UNIQUE PROPERTY.

03:12.959 --> 03:14.227
- I LOVE IT.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.228
- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DO

03:15.261 --> 03:16.429
WITH THE SELLER.

03:16.463 --> 03:17.630
IMPRESS HIM LIKE YOU'VE
IMPRESSED ME SO FAR.

03:17.664 --> 03:18.798
- ABSOLUTELY.
I WILL, I WILL.

03:18.832 --> 03:19.866
- HIS NAME'S ANDY.

03:19.899 --> 03:20.867
- ANDY?
- ANDY.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.901
- I LIKE HIM ALREADY.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.370
[laughs]
- JUST HOPE HE LIKES YOU.

03:23.403 --> 03:25.672
- WOW.
I AM VERY EXCITED.

03:25.705 --> 03:26.906
I KNOW THAT I'M NOT
AS EXPERIENCED

03:26.940 --> 03:28.274
AS MOST OF THE PEOPLE
IN THIS COMPANY.

03:28.308 --> 03:31.411
HOWEVER, ANY HELP THAT A TOP GUY
LIKE ZHANN CAN GIVE ME,

03:31.444 --> 03:32.912
IT'S AMAZING.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.881
- I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.449
- MAKE US PROUD.
- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.118
I WILL MAKE YOU PROUD.
YOU TOO, BUDDY.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.553
[laughter]

03:46.593 --> 03:47.994
- HI, ROSS.

03:48.094 --> 03:50.797
I'LL BE, LIKE, TWO MINUTES.
SEE YOU THEN.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.599
I'M MEETING WITH ROSS,
A DEVELOPER,

03:52.632 --> 03:54.200
REGARDING A TRIPLEX PENTHOUSE
DOWNTOWN.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.203
ROSS ALSO HAPPENS TO BE
A HISTORY BUFF.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.305
HE FINDS THESE OLD,
BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS

03:59.339 --> 04:01.341
AND HE RESTORES THEM.

04:01.374 --> 04:04.044
BREWSTER CARRIAGE HOUSE
AT 374 BROOME,

04:04.044 --> 04:07.380
IS SMACK-DAB IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOHO, LITTLE ITALY,

04:07.414 --> 04:08.381
AND CHINATOWN...

04:08.415 --> 04:09.883
[knocks on door]

04:09.916 --> 04:10.884
WHICH MAKES THIS BUILDING
ATTRACTIVE

04:10.917 --> 04:12.052
TO A LOT OF
DIFFERENT BUYERS.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.186
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:13.219 --> 04:15.321
- COME ON IN.
- SO, THIS IS THE PENTHOUSE.

04:15.355 --> 04:16.389
- YEAH, THIS IS IT.

04:16.423 --> 04:20.226
- WOW. BEAUTIFUL.

04:20.260 --> 04:25.732
- SO, THE BUILDING IS A VERY,
VERY OLD CARRIAGE MANUFACTORY.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.701
- ROSS DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED
THE ENTIRE BUILDING,

04:27.734 --> 04:30.470
BUT THE PENTHOUSE WAS REALLY
A LABOR OF LOVE FOR HIM.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.072
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

04:32.072 --> 04:33.239
- SO, NOW WE'RE IN, LIKE, WHAT
USED TO BE THE LACQUER ROOM.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.241
- WAIT, WAIT.
THIS IS TWO LIVING ROOMS.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.676
ONE LIVING ROOM DOWNSTAIRS,

04:36.710 --> 04:38.278
AND THEN A MASSIVE LIVING ROOM
UPSTAIRS.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.546
- SO, COME AND CHECK OUT
THE BEDROOM.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.314
LOOK AT THIS.
THERE'S A SKYLIGHT.

04:41.348 --> 04:45.685
- OH, MY GOD.
THERE'S SO MUCH LIGHT.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.388
WAIT, WHAT'S UP HERE?
THIS IS THE TERRACE?

04:48.421 --> 04:52.926
- HALF YOUR APARTMENT, HALF THE
FLOOR, IS YOUR OWN ROOF DECK.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.128
- OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THIS VIEW!

04:55.161 --> 04:56.329
EMPIRE STATE.

04:56.363 --> 04:58.231
I HAVE EVERY LANDMARK HERE.
I LOVE IT.

04:58.264 --> 04:59.933
- YOU LOVE IT?
- I'M OBSESSED WITH IT.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.501
LET'S GO DOWN
AND TALK PRICE.

05:01.534 --> 05:02.535
- ALL RIGHT.

05:02.569 --> 05:03.703
I DON'T REALLY LIKE
THIS BIT,

05:03.737 --> 05:04.804
BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS

05:04.838 --> 05:06.473
BROKERS
IS A NECESSARY EVIL.

05:06.506 --> 05:08.408
SORRY, FREDRIK.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO OFFEND YOU.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.744
- LET'S TALK ABOUT
PRICE FIRST, ROSS.

05:10.777 --> 05:12.912
UM, YOU'VE DONE
AN AMAZING JOB.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.281
THE FINISHES ARE EXQUISITE,
BEAUTIFUL.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.649
- THANK YOU.

05:16.683 --> 05:20.520
- NOW, 6 1/2
IS THE ASKING PRICE

05:20.553 --> 05:24.057
THAT I THINK
IS THE RIGHT TAG.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.392
- UH, I MEAN,

05:25.425 --> 05:28.061
THE NUMBER WHICH WE WERE
THINKING MORE LIKE WAS 7.

05:28.094 --> 05:29.763
- YOU WOULDN'T BE HAPPY
WITH 6 1/2 MILLION?

05:29.796 --> 05:32.832
- UM, WE SEE IT FIVE YEARS
AWAY FROM NOW, AND--

05:32.866 --> 05:34.367
- OH, YEAH, FIVE YEARS FROM NOW?
- YEAH?

05:34.401 --> 05:35.735
- THIS MIGHT BE
9 1/2 MILLION,

05:35.769 --> 05:37.237
BUT WE'RE IN 2013 NOW,

05:37.270 --> 05:39.172
AND WE'VE GOT TO LIVE
IN THE NOW.

05:39.205 --> 05:40.740
IF I COULD GET
6 1/2 MILLION,

05:40.774 --> 05:42.575
THAT'S OVER $1,900 A FOOT.

05:42.609 --> 05:45.578
THAT'S A SKYROCKET HIGH PRICE
FOR THIS AREA.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.781
WITHIN A FOUR-BLOCK RADIUS,
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE COMP

05:47.814 --> 05:51.351
THAT SUPPORTS THAT NUMBER.

05:51.384 --> 05:54.654
- SO, IF YOU THINK
IT'S GONNA BE A 6.5 UNIT,

05:54.688 --> 05:56.189
I THINK WE SHOULD PUT IT ON FOR
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT

05:56.222 --> 05:57.924
AND HAVE
SOME NEGOTIATING SPACE.

05:57.957 --> 06:02.629
- LIKE WHAT?
- 6.95, .99.

06:02.662 --> 06:04.364
- I'M WILLING TO LIST IT
AT 6.995,

06:04.397 --> 06:05.565
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID

06:05.598 --> 06:09.069
ABOUT THE 6.5 BEING
THE ACTUAL END PRICE.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.037
- OKAY. LET'S DO IT.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.038
- LET'S DO IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.373
- GONNA MAKE YOU PROUD.

06:13.406 --> 06:14.541
- YOU'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING
WE ASK FOR?

06:14.574 --> 06:15.909
OF COURSE YOU ARE.
- I'M GONNA SELL IT.

06:15.942 --> 06:17.277
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.713
- SO, PLEASE,
LET'S GET THIS DONE.

06:19.746 --> 06:22.549
- AND YOU'RE GONNA SAY
THAT I'M THE NECESSARY GOOD.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.584
- [laughs]

06:29.723 --> 06:31.725
- JOE, WE'RE GONNA GO
TO 90 WILLIAM.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.893
THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT IS
A GREAT AREA TO PURCHASE IN,

06:33.927 --> 06:35.962
BECAUSE YOU CAN GET
A TWO-BEDROOM

06:36.062 --> 06:41.468
FOR $1.2, $1.3 MILLION,
WHEN A FEW BLOCKS NORTH,

06:41.501 --> 06:42.902
IT WILL COST YOU DOUBLE.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.772
HELLO.
- HI. YOU MUST BE RYAN.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.140
- YES.
- IT'S NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.541
COME ON IN.
- ABSOLUTELY.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.910
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. WOW.
- YOU'RE SO HANDSOME.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.746
BUT STILL, YOU HAVE TO
TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES.

06:52.779 --> 06:55.081
NO EXCEPTION.
- OH, SURE. OKAY.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.917
PATTY IS A SWEET,
SWEET LITTLE GRANDMOTHER.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.520
I LOVE YOUR WALLPAPER.
- IT'S CUTE.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.055
- GRANDMOTHERS LOVE ME.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.224
- COME ON IN.
LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.227
[upbeat music]

07:07.260 --> 07:11.131
* *

07:11.164 --> 07:13.233
A NICE, OPEN KITCHEN.

07:13.266 --> 07:19.539
* *

07:19.572 --> 07:21.408
- THIS IS THE MASTER SUITE.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.542
- I LIKE THE COLORS.

07:22.575 --> 07:23.910
THERE'S A CAMERA

07:23.943 --> 07:25.078
THAT'S POINTING
TOWARDS THE BED.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.746
I'M JUST WONDERING
WHAT THAT'S FOR.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.049
- [laughs]
WE'RE NASTY.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.050
[laughs]
- I SEE.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.485
- I LOVE MY GRANDKIDS.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.320
I LIKE THEM TO COME OVER
AND STAY,

07:34.354 --> 07:37.524
BUT NOW I HAVE TO SHARE
THE ROOM WITH THEM,

07:37.557 --> 07:39.059
AND IT'S NOT WORKING
FOR ME

07:39.059 --> 07:40.427
BECAUSE I HAVE
MY OWN BUSINESS NOW.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.961
- I GET IT. OKAY.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.396
SO, WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS
DO YOU HAVE?

07:43.430 --> 07:47.567
- UM, LET'S SEE.
THERE WE GO.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.869
- WHOA. OH, MAN.

07:49.903 --> 07:53.673
YOU ARE A-A-A BOW MAKER.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.209
GOD.
I-I LIKE THIS ONE.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.744
I LIKE PURPLE.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.079
- IT'S CALLED
FANCY PARTY GIRLS.

07:59.112 --> 08:02.115
- THIS IS FANCY PARTY GIRLS?
- YES.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.552
I THINK IT WILL BE TIME
TO EXPAND MY BUSINESS.

08:05.585 --> 08:06.686
- SO YOU NEED A BIGGER PLACE.
GOT IT.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.622
- YEAH. THREE BEDROOMS,
BATTERY PARK.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.623
- OKAY.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.926
- LET'S HAVE A SEAT.
- YEAH.

08:13.026 --> 08:16.496
- SO, HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
THIS APARTMENT WILL LIST FOR?

08:16.529 --> 08:19.232
- THE WHOLE FINANCIAL DISTRICT
IS TRADING RIGHT NOW

08:19.265 --> 08:22.268
AT JUST UNDER 1,000 A FOOT,

08:22.302 --> 08:23.737
SO I WAS THINKING
ABOUT PRICING IT

08:23.770 --> 08:27.507
AT MAYBE 1,175,000.

08:27.540 --> 08:31.578
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

08:31.611 --> 08:34.047
- NOT KIDDING YOU.

08:34.047 --> 08:37.650
- I BOUGHT THIS PLACE
FOR CLOSE TO 1.25,

08:37.684 --> 08:39.819
AND I DID NOT WANT TO TAKE
A HIT,

08:39.853 --> 08:44.324
SO WE'RE GONNA LIST IT
FOR 1.25.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.293
- OH.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.963
COULD WE DISCUSS IT
JUST A LITTLE BIT, THOUGH?

08:50.063 --> 08:51.965
- I THINK WE CAN DO IT
FOR 1.25.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.937
- THERE ARE SOME OTHER
TWO-BEDROOMS OUT THERE

08:57.971 --> 09:00.740
SELLING FOR
A LITTLE BIT LESS.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.642
- NO.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.545
- OKAY, SO YOU DON'T WANT TO
HEAR ANYTHING UNDER 1.25?

09:05.578 --> 09:08.014
- NO, NO, NO.
DON'T WASTE MY TIME.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.116
- SO WE'RE GONNA...
[laughs]

09:10.150 --> 09:12.585
IT TURNS OUT,
SHE HAS THE SOUL

09:12.619 --> 09:15.355
OF A 30-YEAR-OLD
WALL STREET BALLBUSTER,

09:15.388 --> 09:17.557
AND I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS
TO MAKE HER MAD.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.126
YOU'RE TOUGH.
- I'M A BUSINESSWOMAN, REMEMBER.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.261
- YOU ARE A BUSINESSWOMAN.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.395
BUT IT MIGHT TAKE
A LITTLE BIT LONGER--

09:22.429 --> 09:23.697
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING--

09:23.730 --> 09:25.331
FOR SOMEONE TO COME IN
AND PAY FULL PRICE.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.332
- LET'S SEE.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.801
- GOOD.
I AM A MAGICIAN.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.302
I'M GONNA DO IT.
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.770
- A HANDSOME MAGICIAN.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.872
- I AM.
I AM A HANDSOME MAGICIAN.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.909
- WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING?

09:35.942 --> 09:39.713
- IN THE $8 MILLION RANGE.
- [laughs] $8 MILLION?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.748
ARE YOU [bleep]
KIDDING ME?

09:51.491 --> 09:54.260
- THE WEST VILLAGE--
IT'S YOUNG, IT'S HIP.

09:54.294 --> 09:57.597
THE DEMAND FOR TOWNHOUSES,
IT'S VERY, VERY HIGH,

09:57.630 --> 09:59.099
AND THE INVENTORY
IS VERY, VERY LOW.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.467
[knocks on door]

10:00.500 --> 10:02.369
MY COMPANY BELIEVED IN ME
TO GIVE ME THIS LISTING.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.436
- ANDY.
- LUIS.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.671
- HOW ARE YOU?
NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:04.704 --> 10:05.705
- THE PLEASURE IS MINE.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.140
I NEED TO GET THIS ONE.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.441
THIS IS SUCH
AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.809
I CAN'T [bleep] UP.

10:09.843 --> 10:13.279
- LOOK AT THE HOUSE.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.981
- OKAY.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.984
[upbeat music]

10:18.018 --> 10:26.026
* *

10:27.827 --> 10:28.962
OKAY.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.964
I THINK ZHANN
IS TESTING ME.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.866
THIS HAS GOT TO BE A TEST.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.067
SO, NOW, THIS IS, UH,

10:34.100 --> 10:35.402
WE'VE GOT ONE APARTMENT
PER FLOOR?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.837
THIS ONE IS THE ONE THAT
YOU'RE CURRENTLY LIVING IN?

10:37.871 --> 10:39.139
- YES.
I'M ON THE THIRD FLOOR.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.974
I HAVE A TENANT
IN THE SECOND.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.109
THE FIRST FLOOR
HAS MY GARAGE.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.911
- WHEN DID YOU BOUGHT IT?
- 1977.

10:44.944 --> 10:46.513
I'VE HAD IT 35 YEARS NOW.

10:46.546 --> 10:49.249
- OH. SHOW ME THE REST.
- SURE.

10:49.282 --> 10:52.018
THE KITCHEN, COMPARED TO THE
REST OF THE HOUSE, IS MODERN.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.319
IT'S FROM 1982.

10:53.353 --> 10:57.323
- MODERN?
ARE YOU [bleep] KIDDING ME?

10:57.357 --> 10:59.025
WHY THE RED CARPET?

10:59.059 --> 11:00.927
RED CARPETS
THAT ARE DISGUSTING.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.196
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO
ACTUALLY PICKS THAT COLOR.

11:03.229 --> 11:06.232
- THAT WAS ACTUALLY MY MOTHER'S
WHEN SHE HAD THIS APARTMENT,

11:06.266 --> 11:08.068
AND I'VE NEVER CHANGED IT.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.669
- I'M SO SORRY
TO ANDY'S MOTHER.

11:09.703 --> 11:14.074
I DID NOT MEAN TO DISRESPECT
THIS CARPET, BUT HOLY [bleep].

11:14.074 --> 11:16.076
[laughs]

11:16.076 --> 11:17.444
- I'LL SHOW YOU
THE SECOND FLOOR.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.412
IT'S CURRENTLY RENTED.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.585
THIS, AS YOU CAN SEE,

11:25.618 --> 11:29.089
IT'S QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT
FROM THE UPSTAIRS.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.323
- [bleep].

11:30.357 --> 11:33.326
[upbeat music]

11:33.360 --> 11:34.694
OH, WOW.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.097
- IT'S NOW SET UP
AS A TWO-CAR GARAGE.

11:37.097 --> 11:40.266
- FINALLY, A GEM HIDDEN
BENEATH THIS CRAP.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.701
THIS IS VERY COOL.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.003
THERE IS NO GARAGES
IN THE CITY.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.337
THERE WAS A DEAL JUST RECENTLY
THAT SOMEBODY BOUGHT

11:44.371 --> 11:46.106
ONE PARKING GARAGE
FOR $1 MILLION

11:46.139 --> 11:47.307
TO PUT HIS FERRARI.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.176
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.478
ALL RIGHT, UH, ANDY,

11:51.511 --> 11:53.513
SO, WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING?

11:53.546 --> 11:58.451
- OH, IN THE $8 MILLION RANGE.
- [laughs] $8 MILLION?

11:58.485 --> 12:01.054
I'VE DONE MY HOMEWORK,
AND I KNOW THAT A PROPERTY

12:01.054 --> 12:03.189
THAT NEEDS THIS MUCH WORK

12:03.223 --> 12:05.058
WILL NEVER GET A PRICE
LIKE THAT.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.060
WELL, IT IS
A VERY SPECIAL PROPERTY.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.095
RIGHT NOW, OBVIOUSLY,
IT'S MULTI-FAMILY.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.530
PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY BUY IT

12:10.563 --> 12:12.065
HAVE TO MAKE IT
INTO A SINGLE FAMILY.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.801
UH, MY THOUGHTS
ON THE PRICE,

12:14.834 --> 12:19.072
IT HAS TO BE AROUND
THE $1,390 A SQUARE FOOT,

12:19.072 --> 12:21.107
BUT IT COMES OUT
TO ABOUT 7 MILLION.

12:21.141 --> 12:24.344
- WELL, I THINK
YOU'RE INCORRECT,

12:24.377 --> 12:27.113
BECAUSE THE HOUSE
ACROSS THE STREET

12:27.147 --> 12:30.083
JUST RECENTLY SOLD
FOR 2,500 A SQUARE FOOT,

12:30.116 --> 12:31.785
SO I THINK
YOU'RE A BIT LOW.

12:31.818 --> 12:35.088
- OKAY, THIS STILL
NEEDS RENOVATION,

12:35.088 --> 12:38.324
SO YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE HIM
A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.427
8 MILLION IS--
IT'S WAY TOO HIGH.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.596
- I THINK IF WE'RE TALKING IN
THE $1,500 RANGE A SQUARE FOOT,

12:43.630 --> 12:45.899
THAT THERE'S ENOUGH PLAY
IN THERE

12:45.932 --> 12:49.903
FOR SOMEONE TO DO
A REALLY NICE GUT REHAB.

12:52.372 --> 12:56.109
- $1,400 A FOOT
WAS ACTUALLY A PRICE

12:56.109 --> 12:57.677
THAT I THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY
GOING TO BE WORTH IT,

12:57.711 --> 13:00.480
BUT SINCE THE FACT
THAT WE HAVE A GARAGE,

13:00.513 --> 13:01.715
I THINK WE ADD A PREMIUM
TO THAT,

13:01.748 --> 13:03.883
SO I THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY
MAKE YOU HAPPY AT AROUND

13:03.917 --> 13:05.085
1,450 A FOOT.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.054
IT COMES OUT TO, UH,
7.4 MILLION.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.626
- 7.4 IS CLOSE ENOUGH
TO WHAT I WANT.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.861
- OKAY.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.162
- SO, I WOULD--I'LL COME
DOWN TO THAT POINT,

13:16.196 --> 13:18.131
IF YOU CAN SELL IT QUICKLY.

13:18.164 --> 13:20.934
- 7.4 IT IS.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.869
I WILL MAKE SURE
WE GET THAT NUMBER.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.204
- YOU HAVE A DEAL THEN.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.639
- 7.4 MILLION,
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OVER

13:26.673 --> 13:28.708
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING, BUT I
WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

13:28.742 --> 13:30.944
TO FIND A BUYER,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.079
- DON'T DISAPPOINT ME.
- I PROMISE. SEE YOU LATER.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.682
- OKAY.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.589
- OH! I LOVE CHICKEN.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.924
[phone rings]

13:44.958 --> 13:46.960
THIS IS RYAN.

13:49.295 --> 13:50.263
YES, IT--
[clears throat]

13:50.296 --> 13:51.798
YES, IT IS.
[snaps fingers]

13:51.831 --> 13:54.200
CAN I HAVE A WATER, PLEASE?

14:01.107 --> 14:03.476
UM, YEAH, NO,
IT'S 100% AVAILABLE.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.644
WE JUST LISTED IT
LAST NIGHT.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.680
I HAVEN'T EVEN
TAKEN PHOTOS YET.

14:15.321 --> 14:18.558
OKAY, SO YOU JUST WANT TO
BUY IT RIGHT NOW?

14:20.460 --> 14:26.299
YOU KNOW--YOU KNOW THE PRICE
IS 1,250,000, RIGHT?

14:32.072 --> 14:34.074
SO, DO YOU--
YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE IT?

14:38.078 --> 14:40.146
- YOU KNOW, UM...

14:41.648 --> 14:44.551
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.354
YOU'RE A REAL PERSON,
RIGHT?

14:47.387 --> 14:49.089
OKAY.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.191
I GUESS I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG
ABOUT HOW LONG THIS WOULD TAKE.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.126
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN
WORKING SO MUCH

14:53.159 --> 14:57.197
IN THE HIGHER END RECENTLY,
THAT I FORGOT

14:57.230 --> 14:59.899
HOW QUICKLY THINGS CAN MOVE
AT THIS PRICE POINT.

14:59.933 --> 15:03.069
CAN YOU EMAIL ME
ALL OF YOUR INFORMATION?

15:04.537 --> 15:05.839
THANKS, AMANDA.

15:05.872 --> 15:10.176
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.812
DID YOU JUST HEAR THAT?
WE JUST SOLD 9B.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.047
- HIGH FIVE.
- IN ONE DAY.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.215
HIGH FIVE
THROUGH THE GLASS.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.751
OH, I DIDN'T GET
HER PHONE NUMBER.

15:17.784 --> 15:20.253
I REALLY HOPE
SHE EMAILS ME.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.362
- OKAY,
BRING EVERYTHING UP.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.630
I'M GOING TO HOST

15:30.663 --> 15:32.098
AN EXCLUSIVE CANDLELIT DINNER

15:32.132 --> 15:34.100
AT THE PENTHOUSE
AT 374 BROOME

15:34.134 --> 15:35.735
FOR SOME OF THE CITY'S
BEST BROKERS...

15:35.769 --> 15:37.337
OKAY, 25 MINUTES.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.938
WHO HAVE A LOT OF
WEALTHY CLIENTS, OF COURSE,

15:38.972 --> 15:41.775
BECAUSE THIS EXCLUSIVITY
COMES WITH A PRICE TAG.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.847
BACK, BACK, BACK, BACK.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.983
I'M GONNA GO DOWN AND START
GREETING THE BROKERS,

15:50.083 --> 15:54.287
AND I'M NOT GONNA BE HAPPY
UNTIL THE APARTMENT IS SOLD.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.889
SOLD!
[doorbell rings]

15:55.922 --> 15:58.291
HI. OH, MY GOD,
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. MWAH!

15:58.324 --> 16:01.327
I'VE INVITED ONLY
A HANDFUL OF BROKERS

16:01.361 --> 16:03.263
THAT HAVE A HISTORY IN SELLING
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.799
PEOPLE I'VE ACTUALLY DONE DEALS
WITH IN THE PAST

16:05.832 --> 16:07.734
AND WHO CAN HELP ME SELL
THIS PENTHOUSE.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.737
ONLY THE BEST OF THE BEST.
NO RIFF-RAFF LIKE RYAN.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.173
I'M ESPECIALLY EXCITED
THAT YOU CAME, 'CAUSE I KNOW

16:13.206 --> 16:15.775
HOW MANY WEALTHY BUYERS YOU HAVE
FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

16:15.809 --> 16:18.378
I MEAN, YOU DO MORE DEALS
THAN EVEN I DO IN SOHO.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.147
ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS
IS THE STAIRCASE.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.416
IT'S LASER-CUT
AND IT'S STEEL.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.086
3,500 SQUARE FEET
FOR THREE FLOORS.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.921
AND THEN THESE FLOORS
ACTUALLY HEAT UP.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.223
THE QUALITY OF THESE WINDOWS--
YOU HEAR THE CITY NOW.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.625
YOU HEAR, WHRRRRR.
AND THEN YOU GO LIKE THIS.

16:32.659 --> 16:36.162
[gasps] NOTHING.
- YEAH.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.834
- TOP OF THE WORLD.
- OH! GORGEOUS.

16:40.867 --> 16:41.868
- I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

16:41.901 --> 16:44.304
- OH!
- LOOK AT THE SUNSET, GUYS.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.306
- THIS IS BEAUTIFUL!
- VERY NICE.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.907
- COME ON, COME AND SIT.

16:47.941 --> 16:49.576
YOU KNOW, I WANT YOU TO SIT,
ALL OF YOU,

16:49.609 --> 16:51.478
NEXT TO ME,
ME IN THE MIDDLE,

16:51.511 --> 16:53.380
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO SEE
THIS AMAZING VIEW.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.715
COME ON.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.355
- I HAVE TWO PEOPLE THAT
I'D LOVE TO SHOW IT TO.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.524
I JUST THINK IT'S A MATTER
OF TIMING, YOU KNOW?

17:04.557 --> 17:06.493
- A MATTER OF TIMING
FOR ANYONE ELSE HERE TOO.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.094
- I KNOW. EXACTLY.
[laughter]

17:08.128 --> 17:09.562
- THE BROKERS
ARE SWALLOWING THE BAIT.

17:09.596 --> 17:10.630
- I HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE
IN MIND.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.399
I'M READY TO RUN THEM
BACK HERE.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.034
- THIS IS GONNA BE A
$10 MILLION APARTMENT ONE DAY.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.069
NOW I JUST HAVE TO
REEL THEM IN.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.203
MAYBE YOU HAVE
A RICH BRAZILIAN.

17:17.237 --> 17:20.206
- TWO.
- OH! OKAY.

17:24.678 --> 17:26.279
- SHOW ME THE PICTURES
THAT, UM...

17:26.312 --> 17:28.048
- SO, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

17:28.048 --> 17:29.849
I NEED TO DO SOMETHING
WITH THE WAY DOWNING LOOKS.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.152
IF I PUT THE REAL PHOTOS
OUT THERE,

17:32.185 --> 17:34.387
NOT A SINGLE PERSON
WILL EVER COME INSIDE.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.588
- I GOT THIS KITCHEN.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.692
SO, THIS IS THE OLD ONE,
AND HERE'S THE NEW ONE.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.260
- BOOM! WOW!

17:40.293 --> 17:42.495
IN COLLEGE, MY BROTHER AND I
USED TO MAKE FAKE I.D.s,

17:42.529 --> 17:46.666
AND MY BROTHER BECAME VERY,
VERY GOOD IN PHOTOSHOP.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.568
- SO HERE'S THE RUG THAT YOU
REALLY HATE, RIGHT?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.603
- IT'S A VERY DISGUSTING RUG.

17:50.637 --> 17:53.139
- LET'S GET RID OF IT.
AFTER, THERE IT IS.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.307
- BOOM! I LOVE THAT.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.643
SO, YOU CAN DO THAT
IN THE ENTIRE APARTMENT?

17:56.676 --> 17:57.877
- YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.213
THIS IS BEFORE
AND THIS IS AFTER.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.348
- WOW.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.616
I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE
WHITE LIE, BUT COME ON.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.819
I MEAN, A HARMLESS LIE
IS NOT GONNA KILL ANYBODY.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.588
BESIDES, I'M LOOKING
AT THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.156
I HAVE THE OPEN HOUSE
IN TWO DAYS.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.157
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN GET IT--

18:11.191 --> 18:12.359
YOU CAN HAVE THEM
BEFORE TONIGHT

18:12.392 --> 18:13.793
SO THAT I CAN POST THEM
ONLINE?

18:13.827 --> 18:15.228
- I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.
- WE'RE GOING TO HELL, BRO.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.398
[both laugh]

18:18.431 --> 18:19.933
- IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK.

18:20.033 --> 18:22.902
- THIS IS REALLY NOT WHAT
THE PICTURES LOOK LIKE AT ALL.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.938
- I FEEL A LITTLE DUPED, LUIS.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.816
- HI, RYAN.

18:36.850 --> 18:38.184
- SHOES. ALL READY.
- OH.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.586
YOU KNOW THE RULES ALREADY,
RIGHT?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.287
- ALREADY. I'M GOOD.
- OKAY, COME ON IN.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.623
YOU'RE BACK SO SOON.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?

18:43.656 --> 18:45.892
- I MISSED YOU.
- [laughs]

18:45.925 --> 18:48.428
- OH, THIS WE CAN DO.
- WORKING ON MY BOWS.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.797
- AWESOME.
- WANT TO HELP ME OUT?

18:50.830 --> 18:55.869
- SURE, BUT I DIDN'T COME OVER
JUST TO MAKE BOWS.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.537
- UH-HUH.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?

18:57.570 --> 19:01.341
- I SOLD THE APARTMENT.
- HOW DID YOU SELL IT?

19:01.374 --> 19:05.011
- WHAT CAN I SAY?

19:05.011 --> 19:09.749
- DO YOU REALLY MEAN YOU SOLD
THIS APARTMENT WITHIN ONE DAY?

19:09.783 --> 19:13.253
- I REALLY MEAN THAT WE GOT
A FULL-PRICE OFFER,

19:13.286 --> 19:15.388
SO THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

19:15.422 --> 19:18.491
THE BAD NEWS IS,
YOU HAVE TO MOVE IN 30 DAYS.

19:18.525 --> 19:22.028
- HOW CAN I FIND AN APARTMENT
WITHIN 30 DAYS?

19:22.028 --> 19:23.663
- WITH ME.
WITH MY HELP.

19:23.697 --> 19:28.201
PATTY IS FREAKED OUT.
UNDERSTANDABLY SO.

19:28.234 --> 19:31.137
I MEAN, THE AVERAGE APARTMENT
TAKES THREE MONTHS TO SELL.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.405
I SOLD HERS IN AN HOUR.

19:32.439 --> 19:36.409
- LISTEN, I'M NOT GOING TO
ACCEPT ANY OFFERS,

19:36.443 --> 19:38.211
EVEN A FULL PRICE,

19:38.244 --> 19:40.647
UNTIL I FIND SOMETHING
THAT I LIKE.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.716
- I SOLD YOUR APARTMENT
IN A DAY.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.719
I PROBABLY CAN FIND YOU
SOMETHING YOU'RE GONNA LIKE.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.288
- I WOULD NOT SETTLE
FOR ANYTHING ELSE

19:48.321 --> 19:49.556
OTHER THAN BATTERY PARK.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.857
- RIGHT.

19:50.890 --> 19:55.662
- OR ELSE I'M NOT GONNA MOVE OUT
OF THIS APARTMENT.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.034
- SIMON, CAN YOU TAKE ME
TO GREENE STREET?

20:01.067 --> 20:02.068
- YOU GOT IT, FREDRIK.

20:02.102 --> 20:04.504
- OY, YI-YI-YI-YI.
SO MANY EMAILS.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.340
I WISH I HAD 20 FINGERS
INSTEAD OF 10.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.743
[cell phone rings]

20:09.776 --> 20:12.946
FREDRIK SPEAKING.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.981
HI, TOM, HOW ARE YOU?

20:17.751 --> 20:19.753
YES?

20:29.362 --> 20:30.697
HMM.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.432
THIS IS A GOOD START.
I LIKE THIS.

20:32.465 --> 20:37.103
UM, LET ME CALL YOU BACK AFTER
I SPEAK TO MY CLIENT, OKAY?

20:37.137 --> 20:40.106
THANK YOU. I THINK THIS IS
A GOOD OPENING OFFER, ACTUALLY.

20:40.140 --> 20:43.476
I JUST HOPE ROSS
SEES IT THAT WAY.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.985
- ALL RIGHT, SO THE FIRST
APARTMENT WE'RE GONNA SEE

20:52.018 --> 20:53.720
IS AT THE RITZ.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.388
- IT BETTER BE GOOD.
- OKAY.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.190
PATTY NEEDS TO FIND
A BIGGER APARTMENT,

20:57.223 --> 21:00.060
AND SHE WANTS TO SPEND
BETWEEN 2 AND 2 1/2 MILLION.

21:00.060 --> 21:02.095
SHE WANTS A THREE-BEDROOM
IN BATTERY PARK

21:02.128 --> 21:03.930
BECAUSE IT'S FAMILY FRIENDLY

21:03.963 --> 21:05.498
AND SHE HAS ACCESS
TO LOTS OF PARKS

21:05.532 --> 21:06.533
TO PLAY
WITH HER GRANDCHILDREN.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.135
- OH, HEY, RYAN.
HERBERT. HOW ARE YOU?

21:09.169 --> 21:10.236
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THIS IS PATTY.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.304
- HEY, PATTY, HOW ARE YOU?

21:11.338 --> 21:15.075
COME ON IN.

21:15.108 --> 21:18.912
- THE RITZ IS THE QUINTESSENTIAL
BATTERY PARK CITY BUILDING.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.114
IT'S FLOOR-TO-CEILING GLASS.

21:21.147 --> 21:22.482
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.918
IT'S GOT
HOTEL-STYLE AMENITIES.

21:27.754 --> 21:30.724
DO YOU LIKE IT?
- I'M NOT FOND OF IT.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.525
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT

21:32.559 --> 21:35.762
THERE ARE NOT TOO MUCH
CLOSET SPACE IN THIS HOUSE.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.498
- YEAH, SO YOU COULD DO KIND OF
A TALL WARDROBE SPACE HERE.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.100
- YEAH, EXACTLY.
- OH, SHE'S LEAVING.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.103
- HOW LONG
HAS THIS BEEN LIVING?

21:43.103 --> 21:45.105
- IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A RENTAL UNIT.

21:45.105 --> 21:48.141
SO, IT'S BEEN,
LIKE, A RENTAL UNIT.

21:48.174 --> 21:49.776
- HERE I AM, THINKING
SHE'S GONNA LOVE IT.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.177
IT'S THE RITZ,
BATTERY PARK,

21:51.211 --> 21:52.946
PERFECT LAYOUT,
AND SHE HATES IT.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.347
- I HATE THIS WALL.

21:54.381 --> 21:55.515
- SHE DOESN'T LIKE
THE KITCHEN

21:55.548 --> 21:57.450
'CAUSE SOMEONE
HAS COOKED IN IT BEFORE.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.119
- THIS HAS GOT TO BE GONE.

21:59.119 --> 22:00.253
- DOESN'T LIKE THE CARPET

22:00.286 --> 22:01.254
BECAUSE PEOPLE
HAVE STEPPED ON IT.

22:01.287 --> 22:02.422
- IT LOOKS KIND OF FILTHY.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.124
- THERE'S LIKE
ONE HAIR THERE.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.792
- IT'S--IT'S BEEN
LIGHTLY USED.

22:05.825 --> 22:09.829
[Harold and Patty
speaking native language]

22:13.066 --> 22:14.367
- MM-HMM.

22:14.401 --> 22:17.604
PATTY HAS OPINIONS,
AND PATTY'S GONNA SAY THEM

22:17.637 --> 22:18.672
IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES.

22:18.705 --> 22:19.706
ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU SO MUCH...

22:19.739 --> 22:20.740
- RIGHT. RIGHT.
VERY NICE MEETING YOU.

22:20.774 --> 22:21.975
- FOR YOUR SHOWING.
- ABSOLUTELY.

22:22.075 --> 22:23.743
- THE CHALLENGE WITH PATTY'S
CRITERIA IS THAT

22:23.777 --> 22:26.146
THERE'S ONLY FIVE THREE-BEDROOM
APARTMENTS ON THE MARKET

22:26.179 --> 22:28.181
IN ALL OF BATTERY PARK CITY
RIGHT NOW.

22:28.214 --> 22:29.315
IT'S NICE, PATTY.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.450
YOU SEE, THERE'S
A NICE WATER VIEW HERE.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.785
- ALL YOUR NEIGHBORS
CAN SEE YOU.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.754
- RIGHT.
- OH, IT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM.

22:34.788 --> 22:37.090
- DO YOU WALK AROUND NAKED?

22:37.123 --> 22:41.161
- I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
SEEING ME.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.829
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS THE ONE.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.130
- YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
SEEN IT YET.

22:44.164 --> 22:47.834
- I MEAN, THIS ONE,
CERTAINLY NO. I'M SCARED.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.436
- [sighs]

22:49.469 --> 22:50.503
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
NICE TO MEET YOU. KATZAN.

22:50.537 --> 22:51.771
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.440
- SO, HOW--HOW DOES THIS SPACE
FEEL FOR YOU?

22:53.473 --> 22:55.508
- OH, IT'S KIND OF TIGHT

22:55.542 --> 22:58.011
COMPARED TO MY APARTMENT
RIGHT NOW.

22:58.111 --> 22:59.879
- I'M KIND OF STUCK
IN A HARD PLACE HERE

22:59.913 --> 23:03.083
BECAUSE SHE HAS A TIGHT BUDGET
BUT SHE WANTS THE WHOLE WORLD.

23:03.116 --> 23:04.818
- HEY, WE'VE GOT TO
KEEP LOOKING.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.519
- WE ARE GONNA KEEP LOOKING.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.888
AND SHE WON'T SIGN THE CONTRACT
TO SELL HER OTHER PLACE

23:08.922 --> 23:10.190
UNTIL SHE FINDS
THIS PERFECT APARTMENT

23:10.223 --> 23:11.891
THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF NOW EVEN EXISTS.

23:11.925 --> 23:13.093
ALL RIGHT. THANKS, KAT.
- ALL RIGHT.

23:13.126 --> 23:15.495
- SO I REALLY HAVE TO
GET CREATIVE,

23:15.528 --> 23:17.697
OR ELSE I'M GONNA LOSE
TWO COMMISSIONS.

23:28.908 --> 23:32.078
- THE BEST FEATURE
OF THIS HOUSE IS THE GARAGE,

23:32.078 --> 23:35.715
SO I DECIDED TO BRING VERY SEXY
CARS SO PEOPLE CAN FOCUS

23:35.749 --> 23:37.517
ON THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE
OF THE HOUSE

23:37.550 --> 23:39.352
RIGHT WHEN THEY WALK IN,
BOOM!

23:39.386 --> 23:40.954
THIS IS A GODDAMN CAR!

23:40.987 --> 23:42.522
FOR THIS OPEN HOUSE,
I WENT ALL OUT.

23:42.555 --> 23:47.093
VERY NICE.

23:47.127 --> 23:48.762
- LUIS.
- WELCOME TO THE OPEN HOUSE.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.330
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES
IS TO GET PEOPLE IN THE DOOR,

23:50.363 --> 23:52.632
BUT MY PHOTOSHOP PLAN
IS WORKING.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.401
I'M EXPECTING A LOT OF PEOPLE
TODAY.

23:54.434 --> 23:57.270
NOW I JUST HAVE TO TURN ON
SOME PUERTO RICAN CHARM.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.508
THERE IS ONLY TWO BLOCKS
FOR DOWNING STREET,

24:01.541 --> 24:04.511
SO IT'S A VERY SPECIAL
LITTLE STREET.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.512
HI, GUYS.
- HI THERE.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.846
- LUIS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.214
WELL, THIS IS THE--
THE HALF BATHROOM.

24:08.248 --> 24:10.050
UH, IT NEEDS
A LITTLE BIT OF, UH--

24:10.050 --> 24:11.718
- IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.253
- CAN YOU SEE THE POTENTIAL?

24:13.286 --> 24:15.555
- YEAH, BUT, UH, THERE'S A LOT
OF WORK TO BE DONE.

24:15.588 --> 24:16.690
- YES.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.591
OF COURSE THE PLACE
NEEDS A LOT OF WORK.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.760
THAT'S OBVIOUS.
WE CAN SEE THAT.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.896
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH TO GAIN
IF YOU CAN JUST SEE IT.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.064
IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT,

24:24.064 --> 24:25.432
AND DOWNING STREET
IS ONLY TWO BLOCKS.

24:25.465 --> 24:26.733
IT'S VERY SPECIAL.

24:26.766 --> 24:30.236
THIS PLACE JUST NEEDS
A LITTLE BIT OF IMAGINATION.

24:30.270 --> 24:32.906
- THIS IS REALLY NOT WHAT THE
PICTURES LOOKED LIKE AT ALL.

24:32.939 --> 24:35.842
WE WERE TOLD WE HAD GRANITE,
REALLY QUALITY APPLIANCES.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.845
- LUIS, WHERE IS THE HARDWOOD?
- UNDERNEATH.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.447
- UNDER--OH, I SEE.
- YES.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.782
BUT JUST FORGET ABOUT
THIS DISGUSTING CARPET

24:42.816 --> 24:45.618
AND PICTURE THE SPACE,
THE BONES.

24:45.652 --> 24:46.853
IT'S WELL LOCATED.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.621
IT'S--UH, IT HAS
A PHENOMENAL LAYOUT.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.957
- THE ORIGINAL IMAGES,
YOU GOT THE FEELING

24:50.990 --> 24:53.927
THAT YOU COULD JUST COME
WALTZING IN AND BE READY TO GO.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.229
I FEEL A LITTLE DUPED, LUIS.
A LITTLE DUPED.

24:56.262 --> 24:58.098
- ALL I GET IS A BUNCH
OF WINDOW SHOPPERS

24:58.098 --> 24:59.833
AND PEOPLE WITH
NO GODDAMN IMAGINATION.

24:59.866 --> 25:03.336
I NEED SOME REAL BUYERS.
I NEED SOME REAL, REAL BUYERS.

25:12.479 --> 25:16.383
- ROSS?
- HEY, FREDRIK.

25:16.416 --> 25:17.550
- I KNOW I HAVE A GOOD OFFER,

25:17.584 --> 25:19.452
BUT ROSS CAN BE
A BIT IFFY,

25:19.486 --> 25:21.054
SO I'M MEETING HIM
IN PERSON TODAY

25:21.054 --> 25:23.056
TO USE ALL MY GOOD CHARM
ON HIM.

25:23.056 --> 25:24.357
DING!

25:24.391 --> 25:27.160
I HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD NEWS.
- OKAY, GOOD.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.696
- THE PEOPLE FROM EUROPE,
THEY LOVED IT,

25:29.729 --> 25:34.067
SO I GOT THE OFFER,
ALL CASH, OKAY?

25:34.067 --> 25:35.502
- MM-HMM.
- BIG BAG OF CASH.

25:35.535 --> 25:40.774
QUICK CLOSING.
6 1/4.

25:40.807 --> 25:44.210
- OH. HEH.
ALL RIGHT.

25:44.244 --> 25:46.346
UM, WELL,
THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR

25:46.379 --> 25:47.814
WHAT WE'RE AFTER, THOUGH,
ISN'T IT?

25:47.847 --> 25:49.649
- NO, BUT IT'S IN THE 6s.
IT'S ALL CASH.

25:49.683 --> 25:50.950
IT'S QUICK CLOSING AND,
YOU KNOW,

25:50.984 --> 25:52.419
WE COULD BE DONE WITH IT.

25:52.452 --> 25:54.254
- YOU DROPPED IT QUICK,
CONCEIVABLY,

25:54.287 --> 25:58.825
AND THAT'S JUST NOT REALLY
ACCEPTABLE, IS IT?

25:58.858 --> 26:00.827
- IT'S SUCH A GOOD THING.
- IT'S NOT WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.029
- IT'S LIKE A BAG OF CASH, BOOM,
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.864
CAN YOU SEE
THE GOLDEN SHINE?

26:04.898 --> 26:06.266
- I THINK DICK TURPIN
USED TO WEAR A MASK

26:06.299 --> 26:07.834
WHEN HE CAME KNOCKING,
SO, IT'S LIKE--

26:07.867 --> 26:09.102
- WHO?
- DICK TURPIN.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.170
- WHO'S THAT?
- HE'S A HIGHWAY ROBBER.

26:10.203 --> 26:12.038
HE USED TO WEAR
A BANDIT MASK.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.941
UM, 'CAUSE IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE
MY HANDS ARE UP RIGHT NOW.

26:15.041 --> 26:18.678
- YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING
ROBBED AT 6 1/4, $6,250,000.

26:18.712 --> 26:21.081
- YEAH.

26:21.114 --> 26:22.916
- WELL...

26:22.949 --> 26:25.752
- I KNOW.
THAT KEEPS ME CALM.

26:25.785 --> 26:28.188
- YEAH, THE ENLIGHTENED ONE.
- UH-HUH.

26:28.221 --> 26:29.656
- I THINK HE LOOKS LIKE MORE

26:29.689 --> 26:31.124
SOMEBODY WHO JUST ACCEPTED
AN OFFER.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.059
LOOK AT HIM.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

26:33.093 --> 26:34.260
- YEAH.
- SMILE.

26:34.294 --> 26:36.296
OKAY, THIS IS--THIS--
THIS FEELING NOW,

26:36.329 --> 26:37.931
THIS BEAUTIFUL, WARM PLACE,

26:37.964 --> 26:40.567
IS RIGHT AFTER YOU EXECUTE
THE CONTRACT.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.135
- MY WARM, FUZZY,
FUZZY FEELING

26:42.168 --> 26:45.271
IS COMING AROUND AT THE NUMBER
OF $6 1/2 MILLION.

26:45.305 --> 26:46.339
YOU HEAR THAT?

26:46.373 --> 26:48.208
- I WANT TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

26:48.241 --> 26:50.944
I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING
VERY UNORTHODOX,

26:50.977 --> 26:55.281
WHICH IS CALLING HIM MAYBE HERE,
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE QUIET.

26:55.315 --> 26:58.418
- I BELIEVE IN YOU, FREDRIK.
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

26:58.451 --> 27:04.457
[phone line trilling]

27:08.261 --> 27:10.697
- HI, TOM, FREDRIK EKLUND HERE
AT DOUGLAS ELLIMAN.

27:10.730 --> 27:13.633
- FREDRIK, HOW ARE YOU?
- I'VE BEEN BETTER.

27:13.667 --> 27:17.671
AS EXPECTED, MY SELLER WASN'T
HAPPY ABOUT YOUR OFFER.

27:17.704 --> 27:20.106
NOT HAPPY AT ALL.

27:20.140 --> 27:24.878
MMM, THERE'S A LOT OF CASH
POURING INTO NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.

27:24.911 --> 27:28.348
IT'S JUST TOO LOW.

27:28.381 --> 27:31.451
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN ACCEPT.

27:31.484 --> 27:33.787
I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU CAN UP YOUR OFFER

27:33.820 --> 27:38.425
TO AROUND 6.7,
WE WOULD HAVE A DEAL,

27:38.458 --> 27:41.061
AND, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S 300,000 BELOW ASK.

27:45.632 --> 27:49.769
I'M READY TO ROLL TOO, AND 6.7,
I THINK, IS--IS THE PRICE.

27:53.473 --> 27:57.110
IF YOU WENT TO SOHO,
IT'D BE 16.7, NOT 6.7.

28:03.183 --> 28:07.854
OKAY. 6.7.
WORK YOUR MAGIC.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.155
OKAY, NO, NO, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO TALK.

28:09.189 --> 28:10.290
LET'S MEDITATE.

28:10.323 --> 28:14.327
[humming]

28:16.329 --> 28:17.564
- HERE WE ARE.

28:17.597 --> 28:19.099
THIS IS THE LAST APARTMENT
I HAVE TO SHOW PATTY.

28:19.132 --> 28:22.235
IF THIS ISN'T IT, THEN I--
THEN I'M LOSING TWO DEALS TODAY.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.409
- MR. BENITEZ, JESUS.

28:29.442 --> 28:31.044
IF I HAD A GIRLFRIEND,
SHE'D THOUGHT WE'RE [bleep]

28:31.044 --> 28:32.379
OF HOW MANY TIMES
I CALL YOU.

28:32.412 --> 28:34.681
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
[whispers] SORRY.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.616
I'M VERY EXCITED
ABOUT MY NEW JOB.

28:36.649 --> 28:38.718
I LOVE MY COMPANY.
I LOVE THE PEOPLE IN IT.

28:38.752 --> 28:40.086
[laughs]

28:40.120 --> 28:42.622
BUT THERE IS ONE THING
THAT I HATE THE MOST,

28:42.655 --> 28:44.824
IS THEY ASSIGN ME
A CUBICLE.

28:44.858 --> 28:46.760
- LUIS, MAN, LOVE YOUR ENERGY
AND EVERYTHING,

28:46.793 --> 28:47.827
BUT YOU SEE WE'RE WORKING

28:47.861 --> 28:49.195
IN SORT OF AN OPEN WORK
ENVIRONMENT,

28:49.229 --> 28:51.064
AND YOU GOTTA TONE IT DOWN
A LITTLE BIT.

28:51.064 --> 28:52.399
- I HAVE NEVER BEEN
IN A CUBICLE.

28:52.432 --> 28:55.068
I ALWAYS WAS ALLOWED TO DO--
SPEAK OUT LOUD

28:55.068 --> 28:57.704
AND GET EXCITED AND MAKE CALLS
THE WAY I WANT TO DO 'EM.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.072
I'M GONNA GO TO THE BATHROOM.

28:59.072 --> 29:01.608
I GOTTA TALK LOUD HERE,
AND THEY WON'T ALLOW ME.

29:01.641 --> 29:03.510
I NEED A CRAZY, VERY CREATIVE
DIRECTOR LIKE YOURSELF.

29:03.543 --> 29:05.412
[toilet flushes]

29:05.445 --> 29:07.280
JESUS CHRIST, I THINK
I'M IN THE GIRLS' BATHROOM.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.716
OH, [bleep].

29:09.749 --> 29:11.017
- LUIS, THIS IS
THE LADIES' ROOM.

29:19.259 --> 29:21.261
* ROSS *

29:21.294 --> 29:22.295
[cell phone rings]

29:22.328 --> 29:25.131
[gasps]
SHH, SHH.

29:25.165 --> 29:28.468
HELLO?
- HEY, FREDRIK.

29:28.501 --> 29:30.637
- HI, TOM.

29:37.811 --> 29:40.814
THAT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING.

29:50.957 --> 29:53.827
OOH!

29:53.860 --> 29:55.528
AH, THAT HURT.

29:55.562 --> 29:57.697
LET ME UNDERLINE:
IT HAS TO BE A QUICK CLOSING

29:57.731 --> 30:00.400
IN ALL CASH.

30:06.072 --> 30:08.141
TOM?

30:08.174 --> 30:11.044
- YES?
- WE HAVE A DEAL.

30:11.077 --> 30:14.981
SEND ME THE DEAL SHEET
AND WE'LL GET THE CONTRACTS OUT.

30:15.015 --> 30:17.951
OKAY. BIG KISS, BYE.
- TAKE CARE, BYE-BYE.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.286
- EXCELLENT.
DID IT.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.889
- AM I GOOD OR AM I GOOD?

30:22.922 --> 30:24.924
THANK YOU, BUDDHA.

30:28.862 --> 30:32.866
- PATTY HASN'T LIKED ANYTHING
I'VE SHOWN HER SO FAR.

30:32.899 --> 30:35.769
BUT NOW I THINK I'VE FOUND HER
THE PERFECT PLACE.

30:35.802 --> 30:37.303
HI.
- HI. CAN I HELP YOU?

30:37.337 --> 30:40.006
- YES, I NEED A LOT OF HELP.

30:40.040 --> 30:43.043
SO I'M GONNA GO THE EXTRA MILE
AND STAGE IT IN A WAY

30:43.076 --> 30:45.912
THAT I HOPE WILL CONVINCE HER
TO BUY IT.

30:45.945 --> 30:46.980
- ANY PARTICULAR COLORS?

30:47.013 --> 30:49.816
- UM...

30:49.849 --> 30:51.918
I THINK EVERYTHING.

30:51.951 --> 30:55.088
- OKAY, SO WE'LL TAKE THINGS
LIKE, UM, SOME PINK THINGS.

30:55.121 --> 30:56.456
- CAN WE TAKE EVERYTHING
ON THAT ROW?

30:56.489 --> 30:57.957
- SURE.
- OH, DO POLKA DOTS.

30:57.991 --> 31:01.528
LET'S DO THESE AND THIS ONE.

31:01.561 --> 31:03.163
I THINK I NEED A BIGGER BASKET.

31:03.196 --> 31:04.631
- MAYBE I'LL BRING
A FEW BASKETS.

31:04.664 --> 31:06.132
- PATTY WANTS A BOW ROOM.

31:06.166 --> 31:08.435
I'M GONNA GIVE HER
A "BOW-NANZA."

31:08.468 --> 31:10.837
EVERYTHING.
I THINK I NEED ANOTHER BASKET.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.939
- UM...I'M RUNNING OUT
OF BASKETS.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.307
YOU REALLY WANT EVERYTHING?

31:14.341 --> 31:16.476
ALL OF THIS?
- YES.

31:16.509 --> 31:18.978
I HAVE A LOT RIDING
ON MAKING SURE THAT THIS WORKS.

31:19.079 --> 31:21.448
- OKAY.

31:21.481 --> 31:24.417
- YOU THINK THIS IS ENOUGH?
DID YOU THINK I NEED MORE?

31:24.451 --> 31:26.653
[clatter]
I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.

31:36.896 --> 31:38.598
- KAISA?
- YES?

31:38.631 --> 31:40.700
- WE NEED NEW PHOTOS
FOR THE TOWNHOUSE.

31:40.734 --> 31:42.002
THESE ARE--THIS IS NOT ENOUGH.
[cell phone rings]

31:42.102 --> 31:43.903
IT'S LIKE SIX OR SEVEN PHOTOS.

31:43.937 --> 31:46.139
WE NEED LIKE 12, 13 PHOTOS.

31:46.172 --> 31:47.640
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PERFECT.
- OKAY.

31:47.674 --> 31:49.843
I'LL ASK HIM IF HE CAN DO MORE.

31:49.876 --> 31:53.346
- FREDRIK SPEAKING.

31:53.380 --> 31:56.716
HI, TOM.
HOW ARE YOU?

32:00.620 --> 32:02.422
WHAT?

32:10.263 --> 32:11.531
NO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

32:11.564 --> 32:16.436
LOT-LINED?
WHERE?

32:20.540 --> 32:23.410
IN NEW YORK CITY, DEVELOPERS
BUILD UP TO THE PROPERTY LINE,

32:23.443 --> 32:26.913
SO A LOT OF THE TIME,
A BUILDING'S PROPERTY LINES

32:26.946 --> 32:28.081
RUB UP AGAINST EACH OTHER.

32:28.081 --> 32:31.351
LOT-LINED IN THE KITCHEN,
THE NORTH SIDE?

32:31.384 --> 32:33.486
WINDOWS THAT ARE BUTTED UP
AGAINST SOMEBODY ELSE'S WINDOWS

32:33.520 --> 32:34.621
ARE CALLED LOT-LINED WINDOWS.

32:34.654 --> 32:36.156
GET ME THE FLOOR PLAN.

32:36.189 --> 32:37.624
BACK IN THE OLD DAYS,

32:37.657 --> 32:39.459
PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY
OPEN THEIR WINDOWS

32:39.492 --> 32:41.995
AND REACHED OUT INTO THEIR
NEIGHBOR'S APARTMENTS.

32:42.095 --> 32:45.465
THE CITY OF NEW YORK
EVENTUALLY MADE THIS ILLEGAL.

32:45.498 --> 32:46.966
SO IF YOUR WINDOW
IS A LOT-LINED WINDOW

32:47.000 --> 32:50.236
AND SOMEBODY BUILDS UP NEXT
TO YOUR WINDOW,

32:50.270 --> 32:53.006
YOU HAVE TO BRICK IT OVER
AND YOU LOSE THAT WINDOW.

32:55.709 --> 32:57.677
NO, NO, NO, NO. I--

32:57.711 --> 33:00.847
TOM, TOM, TOM, TOM, LISTEN.
STOP, STOP, STOP.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.682
HAPPY?

33:02.716 --> 33:04.417
OKAY, TOM, TOM...

33:04.451 --> 33:06.953
I'M GONNA RESEARCH
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT, OKAY?

33:07.053 --> 33:09.756
GIVE ME A COUPLE OF HOURS.

33:09.789 --> 33:11.257
THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING.

33:11.291 --> 33:13.393
LIKE, WE'RE NOT GONNA LOSE
THIS DEAL OVER THAT.

33:13.426 --> 33:15.061
CALL DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS,

33:15.061 --> 33:17.464
CALL CITY PLANNING,
CALL FREAKIN' LANDMARKS.

33:17.497 --> 33:20.700
I NEED SOME SORT OF PROPERTY
LINE, LOT-LINED MAP.

33:20.734 --> 33:22.469
I NEED, LIKE, A SURVEY.
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND

33:22.502 --> 33:24.270
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BACK
OF THAT BUILDING.

33:24.304 --> 33:26.239
I NEED THIS NOW.
- ALL RIGHT.

33:31.444 --> 33:32.712
- ALL RIGHT.

33:32.746 --> 33:34.414
READY?
[groans]

33:34.447 --> 33:38.218
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING HIGH AND LOW
AND TIME IS REALLY TICKING.

33:38.251 --> 33:42.655
I AM PRAYING THAT 1 RECTOR PLACE
IS PERFECT FOR PATTY.

33:42.689 --> 33:45.592
HERE WE ARE.

33:45.625 --> 33:48.628
IT'S OVER 2,000 SQUARE FEET.
- YES.

33:48.661 --> 33:52.432
THREE-BEDROOM.
- MM-HMM.

33:52.465 --> 33:57.303
- SHE ACTUALLY DOESN'T SAY
SHE HATES IT,

33:57.337 --> 33:59.706
WHICH IS AWESOME.

34:02.609 --> 34:03.843
- THE VIEW IS GREAT.

34:03.877 --> 34:05.545
I LIKE ALL THE WINDOWS
AND BALCONIES.

34:05.578 --> 34:08.281
- MM-HMM.

34:08.314 --> 34:10.717
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT SO CLOSE
TO THE OTHER BUILDING,

34:10.750 --> 34:12.052
SO PEOPLE WON'T BE LOOKING
INTO YOUR APARTMENT.

34:12.052 --> 34:14.854
- YEAH.

34:14.888 --> 34:17.590
- IT'S HUGE.
- NOW WE ARE TALKING.

34:17.624 --> 34:19.426
FINALLY, YOU ARE LISTENING.

34:19.459 --> 34:23.196
BUT...WHAT ABOUT MY BOW ROOM?

34:23.229 --> 34:24.898
- OKAY, I GOT AN IDEA.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

34:24.931 --> 34:27.634
- WHY?
- CLOSE YOUR EYES.

34:27.667 --> 34:29.102
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE

34:29.135 --> 34:32.806
THAT IS GONNA HELP SEAL
THE DEAL...I HOPE.

34:32.839 --> 34:34.074
WAH!

34:34.107 --> 34:35.408
- OPEN?
- YEAH.

34:35.442 --> 34:39.412
- WOW!

34:39.446 --> 34:41.214
OH, MY GOD.

34:41.247 --> 34:43.650
YOU GOT ALL THIS FOR ME?
- FROM A FABRIC STORE.

34:43.683 --> 34:45.618
THEY LET ME IN EARLY,
EARLY THIS MORNING,

34:45.652 --> 34:47.253
AND I SET UP THIS WHOLE AREA.

34:47.287 --> 34:48.955
- YOU ARE REALLY SMART.
- WELL, THANK YOU.

34:48.988 --> 34:51.224
- I'M BLOWN AWAY YOU DID
ALL THIS JUST FOR ME.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.827
- I MEAN, REAL ESTATE
IS ALL ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE.

34:53.860 --> 34:55.295
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DO YOU THINK THIS IS IT?

34:55.328 --> 34:57.731
- YEAH.
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT.

34:57.764 --> 34:59.099
YOU GOT EVERYTHING ON THE LIST.

34:59.132 --> 35:00.600
YOU DID THE JOB THIS TIME.

35:00.633 --> 35:03.169
YOU ARE THE MAGIC MAN.
- OH, GOD, THAT SOUNDS SO GOOD.

35:03.203 --> 35:04.437
- YOU DESERVE A HUG.
- OH, GOD.

35:04.471 --> 35:06.072
LET'S BUY IT FIRST, THOUGH.

35:06.106 --> 35:08.675
AND THERE'S JUST ONE THING
WITH THIS APARTMENT.

35:08.708 --> 35:11.444
- MM-HMM?
- BECAUSE IT'S BRAND-NEW...

35:11.478 --> 35:16.316
THEY'RE NONNEGOTIABLE.

35:16.349 --> 35:18.485
YOU HAVE TO PAY
THE STICKER PRICE...

35:18.518 --> 35:20.487
AND IT'S 2,160,000.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.956
AND THEY WILL NOT NEGOTIATE.

35:23.056 --> 35:26.826
- NOT AT ALL?
- NOT AT ALL.

35:26.860 --> 35:30.897
- CHINESE PEOPLE DON'T PAY
FULL PRICE FOR HOUSES.

35:30.930 --> 35:34.668
- I DON'T BELIEVE
IN STEREOTYPES.

35:34.701 --> 35:37.070
THIS ONE CHECKS ALL
OF THE BOXES.

35:37.070 --> 35:38.605
IT'S EVERYTHING YOU WANT.

35:38.638 --> 35:41.574
AND IF YOU WANT IT,
YOU HAVE TO PAY FULL PRICE,

35:41.608 --> 35:43.743
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
THE MARKET DICTATES

35:43.777 --> 35:46.613
AND IT'S A GOOD PRICE.

35:46.646 --> 35:48.415
THIS IS THE LAST APARTMENT
I HAVE TO SHOW PATTY.

35:48.448 --> 35:51.351
IF THIS ISN'T IT,
THEN I'M LOSING TWO DEALS TODAY.

35:51.384 --> 35:53.219
IT'S MY, LIKE, HAIL MARY SHOT.

35:53.253 --> 35:56.556
- I MEAN, IT IS THE BEST
THAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR.

36:00.060 --> 36:01.027
- LET'S DO IT.

36:01.061 --> 36:03.630
- DO IT, MAN...
BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

36:03.663 --> 36:05.098
- OKAY!
LET'S DO IT!

36:05.131 --> 36:06.099
LET'S GET IT.
YOU WANNA GET IT?

36:06.132 --> 36:07.434
YOU WANT A HUG?
- YEAH.

36:07.467 --> 36:09.536
LET'S GET IT BEFORE
SOMEBODY ELSE GOT THIS ONE.

36:09.569 --> 36:10.770
- I ALMOST JUST KISSED YOU.

36:10.804 --> 36:12.772
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
GET THIS DONE, OKAY?

36:12.806 --> 36:14.040
- OKAY, I--
- YOU CAN STAY.

36:14.040 --> 36:15.175
YOU CAN HANG OUT.
IT'S YOURS.

36:15.208 --> 36:17.744
WE'RE BUYING IT RIGHT NOW.
- [chuckles]

36:24.484 --> 36:26.519
- THE BUYERS
OF THE BROOME PENTHOUSE

36:26.553 --> 36:28.121
ARE WORRIED THAT THE WINDOWS
IN THEIR KITCHEN

36:28.154 --> 36:31.157
MIGHT BE BLOCKED BY THE OWNER
OF THE ADJACENT BUILDING.

36:31.191 --> 36:32.459
[grunts]

36:32.492 --> 36:34.461
OOH. TWO.

36:34.494 --> 36:37.163
NOW I WANNA HAVE A SURVEY
OVER THE TWO LOTS.

36:37.197 --> 36:39.733
I'M GONNA MEET WITH TOM AND GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

36:39.766 --> 36:41.234
[knock at door]

36:41.267 --> 36:42.635
OH, MY GOD.
I'M GLAD YOU CAME HERE.

36:42.669 --> 36:46.139
- HEY, FREDRIK.
- HEY. OKAY.

36:46.172 --> 36:47.907
I'M NOT, NOT,
NOT LOSING THIS DEAL.

36:47.941 --> 36:50.076
THEY'RE PULLING OUT
AND NO EXPLANATION, REALLY?

36:50.076 --> 36:52.112
- WELL, NO, THERE'S
AN EXPLANATION--MAJOR PROBLEM.

36:52.145 --> 36:54.981
THE ATTORNEY FOUND OUT
IN READING THE DUE DILIGENCE,

36:55.081 --> 36:56.483
THIS CAN ALL BE BLOCKED OVER.

36:56.516 --> 36:58.318
THIS CAN ALL BE BRICKED OVER.

36:58.351 --> 37:00.020
SO ALL THESE WINDOWS
CAN BE LOST.

37:00.020 --> 37:01.921
- YOU'RE WRONG, I'M TELLING YOU.
I HAVE A SURVEY.

37:02.022 --> 37:03.423
DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS.
OKAY, LOOK, LOOK.

37:03.456 --> 37:05.725
SEE THAT 3-FOOT SHAFT?

37:05.759 --> 37:07.293
LOOK DOWN.

37:07.327 --> 37:08.795
THEY CAN'T BUILD THIS WAY.

37:08.828 --> 37:11.264
EVEN IF THIS SUCKER BUILT UP...
- RIGHT.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.665
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE
THIS DISTANCE.

37:12.699 --> 37:16.036
ROSS' BUILDING IS LEGALLY
FAR ENOUGH AWAY

37:16.036 --> 37:18.238
FROM THE OTHER BUILDING
SO HE DOESN'T EVER

37:18.271 --> 37:19.839
HAVE TO BRICK OVER THE WINDOWS.

37:19.873 --> 37:21.241
- THIS IS ON MY HEAD.

37:21.274 --> 37:22.575
I HAVE TO ENSURE
THAT THIS IS NOT EVER

37:22.609 --> 37:25.045
GONNA BE A PROBLEM
DOWN THE ROAD.

37:25.045 --> 37:26.946
- TO PROVE IT TO YOU AND TO ME,
I'M GONNA GO DOWN THERE.

37:27.047 --> 37:31.051
- ALL RIGHT.

37:31.084 --> 37:33.253
- OKAY, THIS IS THE BASEMENT.

37:33.286 --> 37:37.057
I THINK WE HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THERE.

37:37.057 --> 37:39.426
[gasps]
I FOUND IT.

37:39.459 --> 37:42.395
HERE IT IS.

37:42.429 --> 37:44.631
[both grunting]

37:44.664 --> 37:46.166
OKAY.

37:46.199 --> 37:47.500
THAT'S THE PROPERTY LINE.

37:47.534 --> 37:48.868
- OKAY, SO--
- SO...

37:48.902 --> 37:50.437
SO THEY CAN'T BUILD THIS WAY.

37:50.470 --> 37:52.238
THIS IS WHERE IT ENDS
FOR THESE GUYS.

37:52.272 --> 37:53.640
HELLO?
ANYONE HOME?

37:53.673 --> 37:54.841
DON'T COME FURTHER.

37:54.874 --> 37:56.109
THIS IS IT.

37:56.142 --> 37:58.078

WHERE YOU AND I ARE STANDING,

37:58.078 --> 37:59.579
BELONGS TO US.
- OKAY.

37:59.612 --> 38:01.881
- HE ENDS RIGHT HERE
AND HE CAN NEVER GO FURTHER.

38:01.915 --> 38:03.683
YOU'RE PROTECTED.
YOU'RE FINE.

38:03.717 --> 38:06.219
THE ORIGINAL BUILDERS
OF ROSS' BUILDING

38:06.252 --> 38:08.521
LOST SOME SQUARE FOOTAGE
SINCE THEY STOPPED

38:08.555 --> 38:10.256
6 FEET FROM THE PROPERTY LINE.

38:10.290 --> 38:15.895
THEREFORE, THIS UNIT WILL ALWAYS
KEEP ITS WINDOWS AND LIGHT.

38:15.929 --> 38:17.864
- ALL RIGHT, I WANT
TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM,

38:17.897 --> 38:19.132
I WANT TO SHOW THEM THIS,

38:19.165 --> 38:20.500

38:24.270 --> 38:26.373
- HOW DO WE FIND OUR WAY OUT?

38:32.712 --> 38:34.080
- GOOD MORNING.
- MORNING.

38:34.114 --> 38:36.149
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
- GOOD.

38:36.182 --> 38:38.184
ACTUALLY, ZHANN WANTS
TO SEE YOU

38:38.218 --> 38:39.519
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

38:39.552 --> 38:41.388
- ALL RIGHT.

38:41.421 --> 38:42.922
- AND WHAT DID THEY SAY?
- THEY DON'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

38:42.956 --> 38:44.524
[overlapping chatter]

38:44.557 --> 38:46.292
- HELLO.
- LUIS.

38:46.326 --> 38:47.894

38:47.927 --> 38:50.897
HOW ARE YOU?

38:52.932 --> 38:54.701

UH, BASICALLY WASTING
ERIC'S TIME BY HAVING HIM HERE,

38:57.904 --> 38:59.572
BUT I WANT HIM READIED
ON WHAT'S GOING ON.

38:59.606 --> 39:01.307
LUIS, IT WAS BROUGHT
TO MY ATTENTION

39:01.341 --> 39:03.510
THAT YOU'VE POSTED
SOME MISLEADING PHOTOS

39:03.543 --> 39:06.613
OF DOWNING ONLINE...

39:06.646 --> 39:07.914
THAT LOOK NOTHING LIKE
THE APARTMENT.

39:08.014 --> 39:09.416
COMPLETELY PHOTOSHOP.

39:09.449 --> 39:10.684
YOU'VE GONE WAY OVER THE TOP

39:10.717 --> 39:12.385
WITH PUTTING SOMETHING OUT THERE
LIKE THAT.

YOU KNOW--

39:20.360 --> 39:22.195
I WAS JUST TRYING

39:22.228 --> 39:24.130
WHAT'S ACTUALLY THE--YOU KNOW,
WHAT THAT TOWNHOUSE

39:24.164 --> 39:27.100
COULD POSSIBLY LOOK LIKE AFTER
THEY DID SOME WORK TO IT.

39:27.133 --> 39:28.902
- WE CAN'T HAVE SOMETHING
THAT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE IT.

39:28.935 --> 39:30.236
IT'S BAIT AND SWITCH, LUIS.

39:30.270 --> 39:32.038
WE'RE NOT A RENTAL CHOP SHOP.

39:32.038 --> 39:34.040
THAT'S NOT HOW WE WANT
OUR COMPANY REPRESENTED.

39:34.040 --> 39:36.109
THERE'S RULES THAT HAVE
TO BE FOLLOWED, LUIS.

39:36.142 --> 39:38.111
- IT'S JUST THAT THE REPUTATION
OF KELLER WILLIAMS

39:38.144 --> 39:41.514
HERE IN THE CITY AND
YOUR REPUTATION IS ALL WE HAVE.

39:41.548 --> 39:43.149

39:45.719 --> 39:49.622

THAT I MIGHT HAVE WENT TOO FAR.

39:56.096 --> 39:57.397
I [bleep] UP.

39:57.430 --> 40:00.266
- WE LOVE YOU, BUT YOU'VE
DONE THIS TO YOURSELF.

40:00.300 --> 40:01.801
- ALL RIGHT.

40:01.835 --> 40:02.969
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
THE IMPRESSION

40:03.003 --> 40:04.070

THANK YOU, GUYS.

40:05.338 --> 40:10.810
