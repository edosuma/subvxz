00:05.440 --> 00:08.138
You know, it's kind of sad
to see this place close.

00:08.182 --> 00:11.837
As a kid, I came here every week
to mail a letter to my pen pal.

00:11.881 --> 00:15.363
He lived on a lettuce farm
in Yuma, can you imagine?

00:17.408 --> 00:19.019
God, I love fresh produce.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.719
Wow. Babe.
We'll be able

00:23.762 --> 00:26.200
to fit way more tables in here
once we rip this wall out.

00:26.243 --> 00:29.116
Come help me with this thing.
It's bolted to the studs.

00:29.159 --> 00:31.074
Listen, I've been thinking,

00:31.118 --> 00:33.163
we really can't call this place
a vegetarian restaurant

00:33.207 --> 00:34.991
if you insist on serving bacon.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.385
:
What?

00:37.428 --> 00:39.343
You're killing the thing
they sorted mail in?

00:39.387 --> 00:41.128
If I was killing it,
you'd know.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.789
Hey. What's that?Dust bunny.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.356
Straight to the lungs.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.271
It's a letter.

00:54.315 --> 00:57.579
Must've fallen
behind the shelf.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.363
Look at the date.

00:59.407 --> 01:00.886
DYLAN:
1970.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.845
So it's been sitting
back there all this time?

01:02.888 --> 01:05.456
It's addressed to a lady
on Lockwood Lane.

01:08.590 --> 01:11.332
Hi. Can I help you

01:11.375 --> 01:13.769
Yes.
We were clearing out
the old post office,

01:13.812 --> 01:15.292
and we found this.

01:17.251 --> 01:18.948
My God.

01:18.991 --> 01:22.386
This is from my husband
when he was in Vietnam.

01:22.430 --> 01:25.259
He used to
send me audio tapes.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.696
He died in that war.

01:35.312 --> 01:36.792
DANIEL :
Claire.

01:36.835 --> 01:41.753
I love you more
than I know how to say in words.

01:41.797 --> 01:46.758
Claire, please forgive me
for what I'm about to tell you.

01:47.803 --> 01:49.805
â™ª

02:18.486 --> 02:20.183
Ah, I'm glad
you guys are here.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.446
I feel like I'm going crazy.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.318
She gets like this
when she's hungry.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.885
Here, give her
some of your muffin.No, no. It's too delicious.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.279
Have you heard this: Laurel.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.586
What the hell was that?

02:31.629 --> 02:32.891
It's that thing
that had everyone fighting

02:32.935 --> 02:34.415
over what word it was saying.

02:34.458 --> 02:35.851
Well, see,
that's what I don't get.

02:35.894 --> 02:37.505
I-I don't understand
how any normal human being

02:37.548 --> 02:40.856
can hear anything
other than the word "Laurel."

02:40.899 --> 02:42.466
MAN : Laurel.Laurel.

02:42.510 --> 02:45.165
"Yanny."
I hear "Yanny." "Yanny."

02:45.208 --> 02:47.036
No, you don't. McGee?

02:47.079 --> 02:48.429
I don't know why
we're even talking about this.

02:48.472 --> 02:50.344
It's old news;
it went viral months ago.

02:50.387 --> 02:51.693
Well, it must've been
when I unplugged

02:51.736 --> 02:53.477
for three days
for my annual mental reset.

02:53.521 --> 02:56.480
Oh, that must've been when I,
when I unplugged, too.

02:56.524 --> 02:59.483
Oh, uh, you know,
for cooler reasons

02:59.527 --> 03:01.703
in a completely
different location.

03:01.746 --> 03:04.009
JIMMY:
You guys.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.968
Word on the basement
street is: it's official.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.535
Has he, uh, made
an announcement yet?

03:07.578 --> 03:09.189
Has who made what announcement?

03:09.232 --> 03:11.147
Everyone. May I have your
attention, please?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.975
As you all know,
Ms. Hines has proven herself

03:13.018 --> 03:15.238
indispensable
over the last five months.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.894
So, as her temporary employment
ends here...

03:20.374 --> 03:22.245
...I'm pleased to announce
that she rose to the top

03:22.289 --> 03:24.160
of our candidate pool
and is now

03:24.204 --> 03:25.727
our permanent
forensic scientist.

03:25.770 --> 03:28.817
Ms. Hines, welcome to the team.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.471
Thank you, sir.

03:30.514 --> 03:31.820
TORRES:
All right.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.476
Oh, wow, and clapping, too.

03:38.609 --> 03:41.221
DANIEL : I wanted to
have it in me to lead,

03:41.264 --> 03:43.527
but I don't.

03:43.571 --> 03:48.271
I can't carry this anymore,
so today is my last.

03:48.315 --> 03:51.535
I decided I'm done.

03:53.450 --> 03:56.279
: But you're
right here with me, Claire.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.238
And I will keep you
next to my heart,

03:58.281 --> 04:00.805
as I say good-bye.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.981
I love you.

04:03.025 --> 04:05.680
I love you, and I'm so sorry.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.945
My husband.

04:09.988 --> 04:13.383
He was saying good-bye.

04:13.427 --> 04:16.081
He killed himself,
Agent Gibbs.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.996
He was a Marine?
Yes.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.564
First Lieutenant Daniel Hall.

04:20.608 --> 04:24.351
Instead of letters, we sent
recordings back and forth

04:24.394 --> 04:26.091
when he was overseas.

04:26.135 --> 04:28.180
These are all from him.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.928
Ma'am...Claire.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.888
Claire.

04:39.931 --> 04:42.369
I am sorry for your loss,
but I am not seeing

04:42.412 --> 04:44.327
anything to investigate here.

04:44.371 --> 04:48.897
There's a man, another Marine.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.725
His name is Ray Jennings.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.379
He's serving life
in prison

04:52.422 --> 04:55.730
for the murder of
my husband in Vietnam.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.908
But if Danny
committed suicide...

04:59.951 --> 05:05.479
A Marine... is serving time
for a crime he did not commit.

05:05.522 --> 05:08.525
48 years, Agent Gibbs.

05:08.569 --> 05:13.487
He's been locked up
for the last 48 years.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.239
Hey, guys.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.415
Guess what.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.982
Ooh, those look good.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.420
Get your own, Bishop.McGEE: If you want your own,
go to the muffin guy

05:33.463 --> 05:34.682
selling them across the street.

05:34.725 --> 05:35.987
It's my second one today.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.249
They're too delicious to share.

05:37.293 --> 05:40.383
Fine. Enjoy.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.254
No, I found this article online,
it said that

05:42.298 --> 05:45.301
"Laurel" hits
on the lower frequencies,

05:45.345 --> 05:48.304
and "Yanny" hits
on the higher ones.TORRES: Dude.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.653
You are still on that?

05:49.697 --> 05:52.308
Yes, because now that I
understand the mechanics,

05:52.352 --> 05:53.701
I can get myself to hear

05:53.744 --> 05:55.311
whichever one
I'm thinking about.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.357
Ah, makes sense. I've always
been able to hear both.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.532
Yeah, they say that

05:58.575 --> 06:00.185
people who hear both
are operating on,

06:00.229 --> 06:02.187
like, full brain capacity
or something.

06:02.231 --> 06:04.102
Oh, like me.Hmm.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.322
Let me hear it again.Okay.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.541
MAN :
Laurel.

06:07.584 --> 06:10.500
Hmm. I still hear "Yanny."
Let me focus.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.675
"Laurel."

06:11.719 --> 06:12.894
:
Laurel.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.286
Okay, go.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.376
MAN : Laurel.Okay, you know what?

06:16.419 --> 06:17.464
My-my brain works
just fine.

06:17.507 --> 06:18.595
Prove it, Torres.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.815
Update.First Lieutenant
Daniel Hall.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.991
McGEE: At the time
of his death in 1970,

06:23.034 --> 06:25.297
he was a rising star,
leading a team of five Marines

06:25.341 --> 06:27.125
on a recon mission
in Vietnam.

06:27.169 --> 06:29.040
They were gathering intel
on Vietcong movements

06:29.084 --> 06:31.347
near the fire support base
where they were assigned.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.393
Where at?I Corps, Quang Tri Province.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.003
TORRES: Lieutenant
Hall was killed by

06:35.046 --> 06:36.308
a Marine
under his command.

06:36.352 --> 06:37.788
McGEE:
Lance Corporal Ray Jennings.

06:37.832 --> 06:40.269
He was the baby of the group,
just 18 at the time.

06:40.312 --> 06:41.705
Murder weapon was a grenade.

06:41.749 --> 06:44.360
The radio operator was
an eyewitness to the murder,

06:44.404 --> 06:47.407
a Corporal Thomas Fletcher,
but because Ray Jennings

06:47.450 --> 06:48.712
pled guilty, there was no trial.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.627
And update out.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.457
What?It's a catchphrase that Torres

06:54.501 --> 06:57.460
is trying to start to signify
the end of an update.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.375
It's not exactly catching on.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.899
I asked for details
of the incident itself.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.380
Boss, we pieced everything
together from plea documents.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.121
NIS investigated at the time,

07:06.164 --> 07:07.862
but their report
isn't in the system.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.385
JAGMAN investigation?TORRES: We are thinking

07:09.429 --> 07:10.952
that both reports
are probably together.

07:10.995 --> 07:14.346
Together where? Why aren't
they in the system, Torres?

07:14.390 --> 07:16.740
I'll get on it.
BISHOP:
Gibbs, remember.

07:16.784 --> 07:20.135
Ray Jennings pled guilty,
so even without the reports,

07:20.178 --> 07:22.877
it's looking like an
open-and-shut case of fragging.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.882
Fragging.

07:27.925 --> 07:31.320
The murder of a superior officer
by someone under their command.

07:31.363 --> 07:33.496
The term was coined
during the Vietnam War,

07:33.540 --> 07:35.367
when the number
of fraggings soared.

07:35.411 --> 07:39.937
The word comes from the weapon
of choice in such attacks:

07:39.981 --> 07:42.331
the fragmentation grenade.

07:42.374 --> 07:45.073
Plentiful, deadly, and...And grenades can't be traced,

07:45.116 --> 07:47.075
which makes it almost impossible
to find the killer.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.380
Uh...Am I right?

07:48.424 --> 07:50.513
Yes, but, it's...

07:50.557 --> 07:53.777
Oh, no, I'm off my cue.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.562
Sorry, sorry,
that's-that's my bad.

07:55.605 --> 07:58.086
I tend to get super invested
in multimedia presentations.

07:58.129 --> 08:00.088
Uh, okay.

08:00.131 --> 08:02.351
Oh, here's where
I'm gonna talk about

08:02.394 --> 08:04.222
the protests going on at home.

08:04.266 --> 08:07.878
Um, an unpopular war meant
low morale within the military.

08:07.922 --> 08:09.880
Oh, and civil rights.

08:09.924 --> 08:12.361
There was rampant
racial discrimination.

08:12.404 --> 08:14.232
Which only contributed
to motive.

08:14.276 --> 08:17.192
Exactly. Some fraggings
were the result of racism,

08:17.235 --> 08:19.020
some were because of drug use.

08:19.063 --> 08:21.283
Others were seen
as a way to stop a superior

08:21.326 --> 08:23.459
who was seen as
too eager for combat.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.852
But let's face it:

08:24.895 --> 08:27.463
fragging is just
one small part

08:27.507 --> 08:30.510
of what made that
war so brutal.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.472
DANIEL : Lieutenant
Danny Hall here, coming to you

08:36.516 --> 08:40.563
from a very sweaty
Midsummer Night's Nightmare.

08:42.347 --> 08:43.610
Oh, did you like that one?

08:43.653 --> 08:45.568
MAN:
Yeah, that was pretty good.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.309
DANIEL: Yeah,
he's the only one that laughs

08:47.352 --> 08:50.312
at my jokes, this one.MAN: I got to.

08:50.355 --> 08:52.096
DANIEL:
Oh, yeah? Why's...

08:52.140 --> 08:55.447
Hmm. That's a beauty.Yeah, right?

08:55.491 --> 08:58.146
I dug it out of our old
technology graveyard downstairs.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.235
Oh, I found a phone for you
down there, too,

09:00.278 --> 09:02.890
if you ever want to upgrade.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.544
: Yeah.
What are you thinking?

09:04.587 --> 09:07.590
Uh, I'm starting
from the beginning,

09:07.634 --> 09:09.723
listening to them
in order.Trying for a read.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.594
The lieutenant's state of mind.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.770
So far, he's not
nearly suicidal,

09:13.814 --> 09:16.381
but it's still early on
in his second tour.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.818
He did two back-to-back.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.561
He had a lot to say.

09:21.604 --> 09:25.521
He was going to be a reporter
when he got out.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.785
These tapes were correspondence
with his wife for sure,

09:28.829 --> 09:32.615
but he was also doing it
to hone his craft.

09:32.659 --> 09:35.575
Documenting and interviewing.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.968
You got that look, Jack.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.536
You know me so well, Gibbs.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.191
Just listen to this again, okay?

09:47.891 --> 09:49.197
DANIEL:
Yeah, he's the only one

09:49.240 --> 09:50.720
that laughs at my jokes,
this one.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.374
MAN:
I got to.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.028
DANIEL:
Oh, yeah

09:54.071 --> 09:56.987
MAN: I need your help.
My roof just caved in again.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.166
The guy laughing
with the lieutenant,

10:02.210 --> 10:04.081
it's the same guy
who supposedly killed him.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.648
Ray Jennings.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.608
They were friends.
Claire mentioned that.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.218
Yes, but it was much deeper
than that.

10:10.261 --> 10:13.221
These two had a real bond;
they were almost like brothers.

10:13.264 --> 10:14.788
I'm telling you, Gibbs.

10:14.831 --> 10:17.704
This does not fit the typical
profile of a fragging.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.621
Maybe it wasn't.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.886
McGEE: We're here because of
a development in your case.

10:25.929 --> 10:28.584
A recording surfaced.
It was lost up until now.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.543
It's a suicide message
from Lieutenant Daniel Hall.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.332
Mr. Jennings?

10:37.375 --> 10:39.334
GIBBS: If you'd like to
listen to the tape,

10:39.377 --> 10:40.509
we can make that happen.

10:40.552 --> 10:43.251
What do you want from me?

10:43.294 --> 10:44.905
We'd like to hear
your side of the story.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.603
In light of newly
discovered evidence,

10:47.647 --> 10:49.910
NCIS is gonna reopen your case.

10:49.953 --> 10:52.521
You're wasting your time.

10:52.564 --> 10:55.132
Guard, I'm done here.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.917
Wait, Mr. Jennings...I said...

10:56.960 --> 10:59.267
you're wasting your time.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.618
I killed him.

11:23.900 --> 11:27.338
Morning, team.
How's it going?

11:27.382 --> 11:28.949
It's going.Hey, so I was just

11:28.992 --> 11:31.473
moseying by, you know, trying
to stay on top of the case.

11:31.516 --> 11:32.996
You got a question,

11:33.040 --> 11:34.824
or is your head just gonna
keep on floating like that?

11:34.868 --> 11:37.479
Well, since Ray Jennings
pled guilty

11:37.522 --> 11:41.048
and said again yesterday
that he committed the murder,

11:41.091 --> 11:44.486
I mean, do we even have
cause to investigate?

11:44.529 --> 11:46.575
We got a suicide tape

11:46.618 --> 11:48.533
and two missing
incident reports.

11:48.577 --> 11:49.883
Plus, the way Jennings
shut us down,

11:49.926 --> 11:51.667
he's hiding something.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.191
I'm not gonna stop working
until we find out what.
Ooh.

11:54.235 --> 11:55.889
Did anyone else just get chills?

11:55.932 --> 11:57.891
You have cause to investigate,

11:57.934 --> 11:59.414
I'll give you that,
but not enough cause

11:59.457 --> 12:00.589
to exhume the body.

12:00.632 --> 12:01.764
You got to be kidding me.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.679
Unfortunately, I'm not.

12:03.723 --> 12:07.770
Your request for exhumation
has been denied.

12:07.814 --> 12:08.771
Yeah, by you.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.643
Gibbs, exhuming a body
isn't cheap.

12:11.687 --> 12:14.429
Leon, you've been out
of the office a long time.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.824
Watch your step, Gibbs.

12:17.867 --> 12:18.999
GIBBS:
Maybe you forget,

12:19.042 --> 12:20.565
I don't give a damn
about the budget.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.567
My priority is ensuring...

12:22.611 --> 12:25.179
Ensuring that justice is served.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.616
Yeah, I know.
I read it in your request,

12:27.659 --> 12:31.272
which, as you damn well know,
is lacking evidence,

12:31.315 --> 12:32.621
and is therefore denied.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.231
Looking for a fight
on this, Leon?

12:34.275 --> 12:35.580
Because I'll give you one.

12:37.278 --> 12:39.193
All right, good news
and bad news, people.

12:40.977 --> 12:42.196
TORRES:
Whoa.

12:42.239 --> 12:44.372
It's heavy in here.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.982
You got my answer
on this, Gibbs.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.947
Please tell me I didn't miss
one of them taking a swing.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.252
Hey, Torres.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.863
Gibbs, I found the reports.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.255
That's the good news.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.518
The bad news is that
they were in a flood.

13:00.562 --> 13:01.955
Is that why they weren't
scanned into the system?

13:01.998 --> 13:04.392
Yeah, they're warped,
moldy and disgusting.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.568
Good luck, dude.Wh-Why are you
giving these to me?

13:06.611 --> 13:08.483
Because reading makes you happy.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.488
This is Bishop.Boss, I got these.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.098
KASIE:
Me. Hello.

13:15.142 --> 13:17.057
Uh, over here, volunteering
to help you scrape off the mold.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.667
Yeah. Let's go.Okay.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.277
You know, mold is actually
a very hardworking fungus

13:20.321 --> 13:21.583
that gets a really bad rap.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.933
Thanks. Uh, Gibbs,

13:23.977 --> 13:26.936
I tracked down our eyewitness to
the fragging, Thomas Fletcher.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.764
He was a corporal back then,

13:28.808 --> 13:31.201
and a retired
master sergeant now.

13:32.768 --> 13:35.292
Take Torres.

13:35.336 --> 13:39.557
And I do believe this bike
is gonna ride like the wind.

13:41.777 --> 13:42.734
Mr. Fletcher.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.562
Yeah, can I help you?

13:44.606 --> 13:46.129
NCIS.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.610
We need to talk to you
about Lieutenant Daniel Hall.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.397
Daniel Hall-- well, there's
a name I haven't heard

13:53.441 --> 13:55.225
in a long time.

13:55.269 --> 13:59.316
My God, and there's
Ray Jennings.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.276
It's amazing.

14:02.319 --> 14:05.235
He and I were the only ones
to make it out of there alive.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.237
The other three
Marines here

14:07.281 --> 14:10.414
were killed about a year later
in the war.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.025
And I'm assuming
you both know

14:12.068 --> 14:14.070
what happened to
the lieutenant, right?

14:14.114 --> 14:16.812
Well, plea documents say
you were an eyewitness.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.423
BISHOP:
Mr. Fletcher,

14:19.467 --> 14:20.990
we know this isn't easy
to talk about,

14:21.034 --> 14:24.124
but we need to know
exactly what you saw.

14:28.302 --> 14:31.653
The night before,
Ray and the lieutenant

14:31.696 --> 14:33.698
went out on a scout.

14:33.742 --> 14:36.658
By the time they got back
the next morning,

14:36.701 --> 14:38.312
things were different.

14:38.355 --> 14:43.012
Things were-were really
off between them.

14:43.056 --> 14:47.625
But then again, we were all off.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.410
Our radio went down,

14:49.453 --> 14:51.020
and the VC could
have gutted us

14:51.064 --> 14:52.979
without thinking twice.

14:53.022 --> 14:57.200
But all I could do is
work as hard as I could

14:57.244 --> 14:59.550
to try to fix that radio.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.642
Damn it.JENNINGS: L.T.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.557
FLETCHER: I saw Ray
and the lieutenant walking.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.473
Hey, I don't know how
I'm gonna get this working
without a new whip.

15:09.517 --> 15:10.779
L.T., hold up.Jennings,

15:10.822 --> 15:12.694
I said I was done
talking about this.

15:17.655 --> 15:20.876
Wait. L.T.,
hold up. No...

15:20.920 --> 15:23.139
I couldn't tell what the hell
they were talking about.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.793
Then things got real quiet.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.623
That's when Ray ran out.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.670
Get down!No!

15:36.196 --> 15:39.851
And the lieutenant was gone.

15:39.895 --> 15:43.203
Look, I know Ray
did wrong,

15:43.246 --> 15:47.729
but when you think about
the jungle and the war...

15:47.772 --> 15:50.688
the war itself was
enough to break any man.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.081
BISHOP:
Mr. Fletcher,

15:52.125 --> 15:54.475
are you saying that
you didn't actually see

15:54.518 --> 15:56.564
Ray Jennings throw
the grenade?

15:58.087 --> 16:00.176
No, I didn't.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.615
Wait a minute, I don't
understand something.

16:04.659 --> 16:08.010
I thought Ray Jennings
confessed.

16:17.237 --> 16:18.760
DANIEL:
Fletcher, you all right?

16:18.803 --> 16:21.719
Fletcher, check in!

16:21.763 --> 16:22.764
Fletcher!FLETCHER: Good to go, sir!

16:22.807 --> 16:24.287
DANIEL:
All right, hey, stay down.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.986
Hey! Stay down over there.
Stay down!

16:27.029 --> 16:28.335
Jennings, you got a visual?

16:28.378 --> 16:30.206
JENNINGS:
Negative, sir.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.731
DANIEL:
That was close.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.733
That was close.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.953
They ain't playing.
People at home, laying in bed,

16:37.997 --> 16:41.043
you want to know what war is?

16:41.087 --> 16:43.263
This is war.

16:48.659 --> 16:52.446
Oy.

16:52.489 --> 16:56.102
Kasie wasn't messing around
with this presentation.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.540
You all right?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.020
Yeah.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.806
Different war.

17:04.849 --> 17:08.810
Still, it's... oof.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.855
Yeah, me, too.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.034
I'll spare you the rest.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.298
Turned out okay.

17:18.341 --> 17:20.822
Yeah, except it didn't, Jack.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.911
No. Of course.
You're right.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.044
There's no way Lieutenant Hall
wasn't affected

17:25.087 --> 17:26.436
by what he experienced
out there.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.742
I mean, look at us.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.918
Our hearts were pounding
just hearing it.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.921
This was Hall's
second to last tape.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.445
He was stressed--
you heard him--

17:35.489 --> 17:38.579
but he was keeping it together.
He wasn't suicidal.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.059
His last tape, he was.Right.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.844
So the question is what happened
between those two tapes?

17:42.887 --> 17:44.280
The last scout
with Ray Jennings.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.934
Right, but what happened?

17:45.977 --> 17:48.023
Hey. What's with the...?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.981
Oh, my God.

17:50.025 --> 17:52.201
Why didn't anyone tell me
what's going on back here?

17:52.245 --> 17:55.074
We got a sealed subwoofer
with a passive radiator.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.466
McGee, the reports.

17:56.510 --> 18:00.340
Right. Kasie tried
to de-mold as best she could.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.037
The JAGMAN was beyond repair.

18:02.081 --> 18:06.085
But I was able to read part of
the NIS Report of Investigation.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.478
Anything?Yep. Ray Jennings
changed his story.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.872
What do you mean?Well, at first he said
he threw the grenade

18:10.915 --> 18:14.049
into the lieutenant's hooch
from outside, at a distance.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.573
And then later, he said
that he was in the actual hooch

18:16.617 --> 18:19.576
when he threw it, then ran
outside, like Fletcher said.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.839
So he was insistent
in saying that he did it.

18:21.883 --> 18:25.452
Why would he change his story
about where he was standing?

18:25.495 --> 18:26.496
You think
you can get him to talk?

18:26.540 --> 18:29.282
We'll find out.

18:29.325 --> 18:33.895
Boss. I'd like to go back
with you, if that's okay.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.070
You got a reason?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.854
Yeah.

18:38.900 --> 18:42.208
You know, my father was only 19
when he went to Vietnam.

18:42.251 --> 18:45.472
He ended his career
a four-star admiral.

18:45.515 --> 18:48.083
Well, he didn't really end it,
he passed away,

18:48.127 --> 18:50.085
about four years ago now.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.305
You know, he did two tours
in Vietnam,

18:52.348 --> 18:55.090
and I can't tell you what
his job was at the time.

18:56.613 --> 18:59.181
Well, he sure wasn't much good
to you, was he?

18:59.225 --> 19:00.878
Excuse me?

19:00.922 --> 19:03.577
Well, any father
worth his salt

19:03.620 --> 19:07.189
would teach his kid how to shut
his damn mouth in a library.

19:08.669 --> 19:10.845
Mr. Jennings...I don't know
who you're talking to.

19:10.888 --> 19:13.326
I was never a mister.

19:13.369 --> 19:16.981
I was a lance corporal,
then I was a nothing.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.157
I was just trying to...Y'all trying to trick me

19:18.200 --> 19:20.159
into talking about that jungle.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.509
Ray, if you don't belong here,
we can help you.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.554
I belong here.

19:24.598 --> 19:27.209
Look around you,
what do you see?

19:27.253 --> 19:30.038
Other guys use their
comm money for cookies,

19:30.081 --> 19:31.561
I use mine for books.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.563
When I got here,
every last one of them

19:33.607 --> 19:35.217
was a waste of paper
between two covers.

19:35.261 --> 19:38.960
I mean, no-no Tolstoy,
no Ellison, no nothing.

19:39.003 --> 19:44.574
"All alone and free
in the soft sands of the beach."

19:44.618 --> 19:47.577
That's Kerouac.

19:47.621 --> 19:51.668
That's escape,
and that's something.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.672
I'm gonna die in here.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.807
I've made my peace with it.

19:59.850 --> 20:04.377
Now you need to walk on out
of here and do the same.

20:07.075 --> 20:09.469
DANIEL :
Lieutenant Danny Hall here,

20:09.512 --> 20:13.995
coming to you from a very sweaty
Midsummer Night's Nightmare.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.825
Oh, did you like that one?

20:17.868 --> 20:19.653
JENNINGS:
Yeah, that was pretty good.

20:19.696 --> 20:22.133
DANIEL:
Yeah, he's the only one that
laughs at my jokes, this one.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.092
JENNINGS : I got to.What do you think you're doing?

20:24.135 --> 20:25.485
You two were friends.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.008
DANIEL:
Oh, yeah

20:27.051 --> 20:29.619
You owe it to him
to be straight with us.

20:29.663 --> 20:32.100
JENNINGS: I need your help.
My roof just caved in again.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.496
Turn it off.

20:36.539 --> 20:39.977
DANIEL: All right, don't worry,
buddy, I got you.

20:40.021 --> 20:42.937
I said turn it off!

20:45.418 --> 20:47.289
No, wait.
GIBBS:
Did you change your story,

20:47.333 --> 20:50.771
where you were
when you threw that grenade?

20:50.814 --> 20:53.513
This is my house, you hear?I asked you a question.

20:53.556 --> 20:54.992
Sam, get them out of here.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.733
Sam, stay right there.

20:56.777 --> 20:58.213
I will throw you out myself!

20:58.257 --> 21:00.128
Did you change
your story?

21:00.171 --> 21:03.305
I'm done playing.Did you change your story?!

21:03.349 --> 21:05.351
Yes!

21:10.138 --> 21:11.879
Why?

21:17.276 --> 21:19.626
He doesn't remember, Leon.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.845
What?

21:21.889 --> 21:23.760
Ray Jennings changed his
story to match the witness's

21:23.804 --> 21:25.066
'cause he doesn't
know what happened.

21:25.109 --> 21:26.067
He blacked out.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.155
He was drunk?

21:27.198 --> 21:28.461
He downed a fifth of whiskey.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.158
We don't know who pulled the pin
on that grenade.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.507
The lieutenant
could've killed himself

21:31.551 --> 21:32.595
or it could've been
his buddy, Ray.

21:32.639 --> 21:33.857
Another time
he blacked out,

21:33.901 --> 21:35.859
he killed six Vietcong.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.600
Okay, so he was capable,

21:37.644 --> 21:40.951
but if he can't remember what
happened, why confess to murder?

21:40.995 --> 21:42.562
I don't know.
That's what I'm telling you.

21:42.605 --> 21:45.391
He's refusing to talk
and he's hiding something.

21:45.434 --> 21:48.045
So what? We got a murder victim
claiming suicide

21:48.089 --> 21:49.525
and a convicted killer
that doesn't

21:49.569 --> 21:51.266
remember what happened.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.487
And the wife of a dead Marine
who deserves the truth.

21:54.530 --> 21:57.054
I'm aware of that.No, Leon.

21:57.098 --> 21:59.927
This time, I'm not
leaving without it.

22:01.537 --> 22:04.279
Permission to exhume
the body, Director.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.459
Do it.

22:22.776 --> 22:25.648
My apologies for disturbing you,
Lieutenant Hall.

22:25.692 --> 22:29.652
48 years at rest.
That's quite a stretch.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.306
But now that you're here,

22:31.350 --> 22:33.308
I'd like to formally
welcome you to 2018.

22:33.352 --> 22:38.269
We have e-mail now
and kale chips.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.184
You'll find that
quite a bit has changed

22:40.228 --> 22:42.361
since you've been away,
Lieutenant Hall.

22:42.404 --> 22:45.668
Yet somehow we're still making
the same mistakes we always did.

22:45.712 --> 22:48.410
The amount of damage
is unbelievable, isn't it?

22:48.454 --> 22:50.238
I knew suicide happened
during war,

22:50.281 --> 22:51.761
but it's still hard to imagine

22:51.805 --> 22:53.633
somebody doing this
to themselves.

22:53.676 --> 22:54.721
What about Ray Jennings?

22:54.764 --> 22:56.375
You spoke to him,
didn't you?

22:56.418 --> 22:58.420
Yeah, that's an overstatement.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.553
Do you think he did this?

23:00.596 --> 23:01.771
Ray sure believes he did.

23:01.815 --> 23:03.904
I-I don't know why.

23:06.907 --> 23:09.779
You are staring into
a glassy lake, aren't you?

23:09.823 --> 23:11.564
Hmm?

23:11.607 --> 23:14.305
A wise man once told me
that the toughest cases

23:14.349 --> 23:17.265
are like staring
into a glassy lake.

23:17.308 --> 23:20.224
All the answers you're looking
for are there at the bottom,

23:20.268 --> 23:24.794
but in between you and them
is the reflection.

23:26.666 --> 23:29.712
Yeah. That's-that's...

23:29.756 --> 23:31.192
yeah.

23:31.235 --> 23:33.977
We don't have
to talk about this.

23:34.021 --> 23:34.935
No, no.

23:38.286 --> 23:43.378
The reflection,
it's-it's my father.

23:45.336 --> 23:48.992
I have a lot of regrets
when it comes to him.

23:49.036 --> 23:51.778
I'm so sorry.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.787
Well, I just made this
very, very awkward.

24:00.830 --> 24:03.746
Uh, would you like me to just
tell you what it is I found?

24:03.790 --> 24:05.661
That would be great.Great, great.

24:05.705 --> 24:08.447
Okay, well, I have pulled
several grenade fragments

24:08.490 --> 24:10.579
from the lieutenant's bone
and remaining tissue.

24:10.623 --> 24:14.844
This... wasn't one of them.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.500
What am I looking at?

24:18.544 --> 24:20.546
A four-inch metal plate

24:20.589 --> 24:22.417
that appears to be fused
to the proximal side

24:22.461 --> 24:23.679
of his right, fifth rib.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.638
Any mention of it in
his medical records?

24:25.681 --> 24:29.685
No, no. In fact, rib plating
wasn't even a procedure

24:29.729 --> 24:31.513
that was performed back then.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.559
Then what is it?

24:33.602 --> 24:36.475
JIMMY:
I sent it to Kasie for analysis.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.741
Uh, Kasie?

24:41.784 --> 24:44.831
Don't stop me now,
Ellie, I am in the zone.

24:44.874 --> 24:47.616
I will get this done
before Gibbs gets here.

24:47.660 --> 24:51.490
Actually, Gibbs is already
on his way down.

24:53.535 --> 24:57.539
Listen, I need you two to
intercept him and stall him.

24:57.583 --> 24:58.758
Break.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.674
What do we got?Oh, hey, Gibbs.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.589
Um, the-the viral thing.Mm-hmm.

25:03.632 --> 25:04.633
Have you seen this viral thing?

25:04.677 --> 25:05.895
No.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.462
Okay, listen to this.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.550
MAN :
Laurel.

25:08.594 --> 25:09.551
What do you hear?

25:09.595 --> 25:11.466
"Laurel" and "Yanny."

25:11.510 --> 25:12.685
At the same time?

25:12.728 --> 25:13.903
And "Blizzard.""Blizzard"?

25:13.947 --> 25:15.383
He heard a third word?

25:15.426 --> 25:18.473
He's operating at beyond
full brain capacity.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.605
What do you got?

25:19.648 --> 25:22.172
Uh, listen, before
we get to that,

25:22.216 --> 25:24.566
I hear you have a boat
in your basement.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.394
Man, what's up with that?

25:28.178 --> 25:30.267
Okay, so, uh,
Jimmy found this plate

25:30.311 --> 25:32.095
on one of the
lieutenant's ribs.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.488
I removed it
from the bone.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.359
What kind of plate?Uh, it's brass.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.100
I'm pretty sure
it's a piece of something

25:37.144 --> 25:39.755
that was near Hall
when the grenade went off.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.627
The blast must've fused it
to his ribs.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.803
Ooh. Oh, I managed
to remove enough debris

25:43.846 --> 25:45.761
to see that there's
an engraving on it.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.154
What's it say?
Not a clue.

25:47.197 --> 25:49.460
But if I can get
a little more time,

25:49.504 --> 25:52.551
I can figure it out and put
the answer in a presentation.

25:56.859 --> 25:59.645
Engraving means it's personal.

25:59.688 --> 26:02.038
Mm-hmm.

26:02.082 --> 26:04.084
Cool, cool, cool. Thank you
so much for stopping by.

26:04.127 --> 26:06.434
Great. Oh.

26:06.477 --> 26:07.870
Damn it. I still heard "Yanny."

26:10.090 --> 26:13.310
GIBBS:
"Until we meet again."

26:13.354 --> 26:16.662
When I...

26:16.705 --> 26:19.882
found out that Danny
was going overseas,

26:19.926 --> 26:24.191
I bought two recorders,
one for him and one for me.

26:24.234 --> 26:29.675
And I had them engraved
with matching plates.

26:29.718 --> 26:32.634
It was a strange gift, I know.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.636
No, it's perfect
for your husband.

26:34.680 --> 26:39.336
Well, actually,
he was my boyfriend then.

26:41.034 --> 26:46.430
Those days before he left
were so difficult.

26:46.474 --> 26:50.434
Danny was consumed by what
was happening in the world.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.785
And it wasn't just Vietnam.

26:52.828 --> 26:57.790
Martin Luther King
had just been shot and...

26:57.833 --> 27:03.665
just seemed like everywhere
you looked, there was hate.

27:05.275 --> 27:09.149
But when I showed him the
recorders, his face just lit up.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.803
Well, he knew

27:10.846 --> 27:13.762
that he'd be able to hear
your voice while he was away.

27:15.808 --> 27:18.419
He... he put down
the newspaper

27:18.462 --> 27:20.247
and got down on one knee.

27:20.290 --> 27:23.990
We went to City Hall
the next day and got married.

27:25.513 --> 27:27.689
SLOANE: The recorder
represented his wife.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.823
The plate impacted
the lieutenant's rib

27:30.866 --> 27:32.433
which suggests that he was
holding the recorder

27:32.476 --> 27:33.956
near his chest when he died.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.654
Plus, he said it himself.

27:35.697 --> 27:36.959
What do you mean?

27:37.003 --> 27:38.613
In his suicide message, Leon.

27:38.657 --> 27:43.705
He said, "I'll keep you next to
my heart as I say good-bye."

27:43.749 --> 27:46.447
He didn't say "in my heart,"
like most people would say.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.884
He was trying to tell Claire
that he would hold her

27:48.928 --> 27:51.147
as he died and that's
exactly what he did.

27:51.191 --> 27:53.019
You think the lieutenant
ordered Ray out of the hooch

27:53.062 --> 27:54.063
and then he killed himself?

27:54.107 --> 27:55.064
100%.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.850
Well, I'm at 50%

27:57.893 --> 28:01.027
because Ray Jennings is
still saying that he did it.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.463
And until we find out
why he believes that,

28:02.506 --> 28:03.725
none of this is gonna
make any sense.

28:03.769 --> 28:06.162
The scout.Exactly.

28:06.206 --> 28:09.470
Whatever happened on that scout
made Lieutenant Hall suicidal

28:09.513 --> 28:11.254
or Ray homicidal.

28:11.298 --> 28:14.344
Do we think Ray remembers or was
that part of the blackout?

28:14.388 --> 28:15.824
Oh, he remembers,
but he's not talking.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.173
All right, then you need
to break him.

28:17.217 --> 28:18.914
No.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.176
Excuse me?

28:20.220 --> 28:22.265
He's not the kind
you break, Leon.

28:22.309 --> 28:24.006
Look, Gibbs, I know you sat
in here and signed some papers

28:24.050 --> 28:25.878
while I was gone,
but I'm back now.

28:25.921 --> 28:28.489
Okay, boys, let's
focus here. Hello.

28:28.532 --> 28:30.883
Pushing Ray might get us

28:30.926 --> 28:34.974
a word or two, but he needs
to want to tell his story.

28:35.017 --> 28:37.541
That's gonna take
a real connection

28:37.585 --> 28:39.152
and that needs
to be earned.

28:39.195 --> 28:42.677
McGee. McGee's got
a stake in this.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.287
You think he'd be willing
to get in the mud?

28:44.331 --> 28:46.202
I think he'll do
whatever it takes.

28:46.246 --> 28:48.509
Send him back in.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.739
I get two hours a day
in this room.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.741
I don't want you in it, Marine.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.700
He's not here.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.922
They sent you in alone?

29:11.880 --> 29:17.059
Hmm. Well, pick out a book,
sit in back,

29:17.103 --> 29:21.760
you can read quietly for an hour
and we'll tell them you tried.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.676
I appreciate the offer, Ray,

29:25.720 --> 29:28.984
but I can't do that.

29:29.028 --> 29:31.770
Go home, kid.

29:31.813 --> 29:35.208
I want you to tell me what
happened on that scout.

29:35.251 --> 29:38.951
Appreciate the offer,
but I'm not doing that.

29:38.994 --> 29:41.127
Well, then I'm gonna keep
coming back until you do.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.129
What, uh, your daddy
rode a ship to Vietnam

29:43.172 --> 29:44.913
and you think you know me?

29:44.957 --> 29:48.090
You think you know
what I went through out there?No.

29:48.134 --> 29:51.920
No, I have no idea what
you went through out there.

29:51.964 --> 29:53.748
That's why I keep asking.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.795
That's why I'm gonna keep
asking until you tell me.

29:56.838 --> 29:59.928
My father, I asked him about
Vietnam one time, once.

29:59.972 --> 30:01.887
You know what he did?

30:01.930 --> 30:04.933
He shut me down,
just like you're doing.

30:04.977 --> 30:08.328
I don't know what happened
to him over there,

30:08.371 --> 30:12.593
but it changed him,
it defined him.

30:12.636 --> 30:16.336
And I never asked again
and you know what? I should've.

30:16.379 --> 30:19.774
I should've asked him
a hundred times

30:19.818 --> 30:22.908
'cause maybe he
would've told me.

30:22.951 --> 30:25.780
Maybe I would've
understood him.

30:28.565 --> 30:30.959
Maybe it would've fixed us.

30:37.966 --> 30:39.881
We...

30:39.925 --> 30:42.971
we, uh...

30:43.015 --> 30:45.800
heard the VC firing
at close range

30:45.844 --> 30:48.672
the night before, so...

30:48.716 --> 30:52.938
Lieutenant took me out
on the scout.

30:52.981 --> 30:57.072
We were cutting
through some heavy brush

30:57.116 --> 30:59.074
and we saw it.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.728
Vietcong patrol.

31:00.771 --> 31:02.948
They were heavily armed.

31:05.864 --> 31:10.042
They had an American. A POW.

31:14.960 --> 31:19.051
But what he was,

31:19.094 --> 31:21.401
it was worse than dead.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.403
What did you do?

31:23.446 --> 31:26.014
We fought about it.

31:26.058 --> 31:29.322
First argument we ever had.

31:29.365 --> 31:30.932
All right, move out,
back to base.

31:30.976 --> 31:31.977
I need to make a plan.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.022
A plan?
To rescue him?

31:34.066 --> 31:36.068
It'd be the six of us
against a whole damn army.

31:36.111 --> 31:37.460
No man left behind, Ray,
not on my watch.

31:37.504 --> 31:40.420
You order us in there,
and we're all dead.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.291
This is not your call
to make, Marine.

31:42.335 --> 31:44.163
Do you hear me? This is my call.

31:44.206 --> 31:46.208
I said move out.

31:46.252 --> 31:50.125
We went back to base. We didn't
tell the others what we saw.

31:50.169 --> 31:52.823
But the lieutenant
was going to?

31:52.867 --> 31:54.651
Yes.

31:54.695 --> 31:58.394
I kept on him,
but he would not budge.

31:58.438 --> 32:00.135
He was gonna order us in.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.964
That's when you
started drinking.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.531
Yes, yes.

32:04.574 --> 32:08.796
: It doesn't matter
if I don't remember the act.

32:08.839 --> 32:12.060
I know the thought
that was in my head

32:12.104 --> 32:14.062
before I blacked out.

32:20.242 --> 32:23.245
Calling that order,
Lieutenant was doing right.

32:26.727 --> 32:29.251
But I didn't want to die.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.430
So I killed him.

32:38.521 --> 32:41.220
I killed my friend

32:41.263 --> 32:43.265
'cause I was a coward.

32:56.496 --> 32:59.629
Okay, motive for homicide, yes.

32:59.673 --> 33:02.241
For Jennings.Hold up there, Speedy.

33:02.284 --> 33:03.546
You're getting ahead
of yourself.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.505
You didn't see the
look on Ray's face

33:05.548 --> 33:07.246
when he told me
what happened.
Yes.

33:07.289 --> 33:08.856
But I did listen
to every single one

33:08.899 --> 33:10.162
of Lieutenant Hall's tapes,

33:10.205 --> 33:12.033
and he had his
own issues.

33:12.077 --> 33:15.297
Okay, maybe I should
hold that marker.

33:15.341 --> 33:18.387
You have to admit, Ray had every
reason to kill the lieutenant.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.215
If he didn't, six Marines
would've been killed

33:20.259 --> 33:21.477
trying to rescue one POW.

33:21.521 --> 33:23.566
You're right.
I'll give you motive,

33:23.610 --> 33:26.308
but Ray's story is also
a motive for suicide.

33:26.352 --> 33:27.831
No man left behind.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.920
The lieutenant knew he
had to attempt a rescue.

33:29.964 --> 33:31.270
Yeah, but that
meant leading

33:31.313 --> 33:32.880
his men into certain death.

33:32.923 --> 33:34.751
An impossible choice.

33:34.795 --> 33:36.884
And he said so himself.

33:36.927 --> 33:39.060
In his last tape
he said,

33:39.104 --> 33:42.281
"I wanted to have it in me
to lead, but I don't.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.196
I can't carry this anymore."

33:45.849 --> 33:47.155
Boss, what do you think?

33:47.199 --> 33:49.331
Yeah.Yeah, to which theory?

33:49.375 --> 33:50.506
I see both.

33:50.550 --> 33:51.768
Do you see a blizzard, too?

33:51.812 --> 33:53.161
BISHOP:
Hey.

33:53.205 --> 33:55.207
Got something.
Yeah, go,
let's hear it.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.035
Ray Jennings doesn't
have any family.

33:57.078 --> 33:58.384
No one he's in contact with, no.

33:58.427 --> 33:59.689
You said that he
talked about spending

33:59.733 --> 34:00.908
his commissary money.

34:00.951 --> 34:02.170
Right, on books
for the library.

34:02.214 --> 34:03.432
Which got me
wondering...

34:03.476 --> 34:04.999
Who is sending him money?

34:05.043 --> 34:08.742
Exactly, so I looked into it,
and for the last 30 years,

34:08.785 --> 34:11.614
there has been an anonymous
contributor to Ray's account.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.834
You tracked the deposits?I did.

34:13.877 --> 34:16.402
Through four fake names
and two shell companies,

34:16.445 --> 34:18.534
directly to...

34:18.578 --> 34:21.494
retired Master Sergeant
Thomas Fletcher.

34:21.537 --> 34:22.538
The witness.

34:22.582 --> 34:24.627
Why would he give
money to the man

34:24.671 --> 34:26.194
that he helped
put away for life?

34:27.108 --> 34:29.197
Guilt.

34:29.241 --> 34:31.025
FLETCHER:
So when are you people

34:31.069 --> 34:32.505
gonna tell me
what's going on here?

34:32.548 --> 34:33.506
I think you already know.

34:33.549 --> 34:35.334
No, I don't know.

34:35.377 --> 34:37.640
What really happened the night
Lieutenant Hall died?

34:37.684 --> 34:40.078
I've already gone through this
with your agents.

34:41.862 --> 34:43.820
Get up.

34:43.864 --> 34:45.300
Excuse me?

34:45.344 --> 34:47.302
On your feet.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.483
Here, look at me.

34:54.527 --> 34:56.833
You told a lie.

34:56.877 --> 34:59.445
You told a lie and then
you went and lived your life

34:59.488 --> 35:00.707
like it never happened.

35:02.187 --> 35:06.147
You wore the uniform for
30 years, isn't that right, Tom?

35:06.191 --> 35:10.456
Did you deserve the
honor of wearing it?

35:10.499 --> 35:12.936
Did you deserve
to wear the uniform

35:12.980 --> 35:14.721
of a United States Marine?

35:19.769 --> 35:22.120
I heard them down
there that night.

35:26.211 --> 35:29.170
I heard them down there
in the lieutenant's hooch,

35:29.214 --> 35:30.737
making a lot of noise.

35:30.780 --> 35:33.174
I have no idea what the hell
they were fighting about.

35:33.218 --> 35:36.699
Couple of hours passed,
and everything got real quiet.

35:39.441 --> 35:42.009
And Ray wasn't blacked out,
functional.

35:42.052 --> 35:44.620
He was passed out.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.840
Completely unconscious.

35:46.883 --> 35:49.669
So I decided to get on
with my task at hand

35:49.712 --> 35:51.845
and then went down to talk
to the lieutenant.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.414
Hate to say it,
Lieutenant,

35:55.457 --> 35:57.503
but that radio's a no-go.

35:57.546 --> 35:59.679
Yeah, I figured as much.

35:59.722 --> 36:01.463
Supply drop should
make us whole.

36:01.507 --> 36:04.597
That's in, what,
about five days?

36:04.640 --> 36:07.382
Yeah, don't forget
to give Boyd your mail.

36:07.426 --> 36:09.297
All right? He'll make sure
it gets out then, too.

36:09.341 --> 36:11.256
Yes, sir.Right.

36:12.735 --> 36:14.737
Good night.Night, sir.

36:19.351 --> 36:20.917
CLAIRE :
Hello, there, love.

36:20.961 --> 36:23.703
Things are fine,
but I sure do miss you.

36:25.748 --> 36:27.185
No!

36:29.665 --> 36:32.799
You knew all along
it was a suicide.

36:34.757 --> 36:36.281
Yes, I did.

36:36.324 --> 36:38.848
Why'd you pin it
onto Ray Jennings?

36:39.762 --> 36:41.590
Two altercations
on your record.

36:41.634 --> 36:45.551
Both before this happened, both
with African American Marines.

36:47.814 --> 36:49.598
Let me just tell
both of you something.

36:49.642 --> 36:51.948
Back then, we were
at war here, too.

36:51.992 --> 36:54.516
They were on one side
and we were on the other.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.691
That's just the way it was.

36:55.735 --> 36:56.997
And in that jungle,

36:57.040 --> 37:01.828
I had to trust the man
next to me with my life.

37:01.871 --> 37:02.959
And you couldn't trust Ray

37:03.003 --> 37:04.526
because of the color
of his skin.

37:04.570 --> 37:06.615
So you tried to
get him sent home.

37:06.659 --> 37:10.010
I thought he was gonna get
a slap on the wrist

37:10.053 --> 37:11.707
and a discharge.

37:11.751 --> 37:15.842
That's how they dealt
with these fragging situations.

37:15.885 --> 37:17.800
Couldn't prove anything.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.715
But then Ray confessed.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.978
You let him believe
he was guilty.

37:22.022 --> 37:24.633
I couldn't own up to the lie.
It would've ruined my career.

37:24.677 --> 37:27.027
You have to see that.
You have to understand that.

37:27.070 --> 37:30.639
You had 48 years
to set the record straight.

37:37.385 --> 37:41.215
I did what I had to do
to survive, Agent Gibbs.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.742
So what's gonna happen
to Thomas Fletcher?

37:46.786 --> 37:49.310
Not much.
The statute of limitations

37:49.354 --> 37:52.661
on making a false statement
passed a long time ago.

37:52.705 --> 37:54.272
Living with something like that
on your conscience

37:54.315 --> 37:56.839
would pretty much be like
being in a prison,

37:56.883 --> 37:58.363
except Fletcher
can go get ice cream

37:58.406 --> 37:59.929
with his family
whenever he wants.

37:59.973 --> 38:01.104
Hey, what're you doing?

38:01.148 --> 38:03.324
Oh. Uh, I'm just...

38:03.368 --> 38:05.195
putting the room back
to the way it was.

38:05.239 --> 38:06.893
:
I mean,

38:06.936 --> 38:09.069
this case was pretty much
one huge forensics fail.

38:09.112 --> 38:10.766
I have this picture

38:10.810 --> 38:14.204
in my head of what a real
forensic scientist should be,

38:14.248 --> 38:17.120
and now I'm finally here.

38:17.164 --> 38:19.993
But I'm not, so...

38:20.036 --> 38:21.995
Kasie.

38:22.038 --> 38:23.605
Look,

38:23.649 --> 38:26.695
you were already here as a temp.

38:26.739 --> 38:29.698
I mean, y-you want to talk
about this case?

38:29.742 --> 38:32.962
Look, you handed off
this clue to Gibbs,

38:33.006 --> 38:35.574
which allowed him
to go run with it.

38:35.617 --> 38:40.448
And that's what being a team
is all about.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.015
Yes.

38:58.031 --> 39:00.250
There's a muffin guy...

39:00.294 --> 39:02.644
selling them across the street.

39:05.778 --> 39:08.911
I hear they're delicious.

39:12.959 --> 39:15.875
It's cranberry.
That's my favorite.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.529
Hmm.

39:27.408 --> 39:30.368
Ray. You ready?

39:33.066 --> 39:35.024
Yeah.

39:35.068 --> 39:38.767
Don't worry. I'll make sure they
take good care of the place.

39:48.908 --> 39:54.087
â™ª Someone told me long ago

39:54.130 --> 39:58.047
â™ª There's a calm
before the storm â™ª

39:58.091 --> 40:00.920
â™ª I know

40:00.963 --> 40:02.922
â™ª It's been coming
for some time... â™ª

40:02.965 --> 40:07.622
You know, I am angry.

40:09.537 --> 40:12.322
At myself.

40:12.366 --> 40:15.064
At the world.

40:15.108 --> 40:17.371
And I'm angry with you.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.939
â™ª I know

40:19.982 --> 40:22.507
But Lieutenant Hall...

40:22.550 --> 40:25.074
he wanted us to live.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.731
So I decided...

40:29.775 --> 40:32.821
I'm gonna let go of that anger.

40:32.865 --> 40:35.215
â™ª Have you ever seen the rain?

40:35.258 --> 40:37.260
And I'm gonna live.

40:39.262 --> 40:41.874
â™ª I want to know

40:41.917 --> 40:43.876
I just wanted you
to know that.

40:43.919 --> 40:48.446
â™ª Have you ever seen the rain

40:50.317 --> 40:54.713
â™ª Coming down on a sunny day?

40:59.500 --> 41:03.504
â™ª Yesterday and days before

41:03.548 --> 41:07.987
â™ª Sun is cold and rain is hard

41:08.030 --> 41:11.294
â™ª I know

41:11.338 --> 41:15.560
â™ª Been that way
for all my time â™ª

41:19.955 --> 41:23.306
â™ª I want to know

41:23.350 --> 41:26.962
â™ª Have you ever seen the rain?

41:27.006 --> 41:30.096
It is so nice to meet you.You, too.

41:30.139 --> 41:33.142
â™ª And I want to know I'm so sorry.

41:33.186 --> 41:37.407
â™ª Have you ever seen the rain

41:40.672 --> 41:44.284
â™ª Coming down on a sunny day?

41:55.600 --> 41:59.386
Staring into a glassy lake.

41:59.429 --> 42:03.172
Sometimes it's a good thing.

42:05.218 --> 42:07.046
Yeah.

42:09.048 --> 42:12.660
Your dad would be proud
of you, Tim.

42:12.704 --> 42:17.012
â™ª Have you ever seen the rain

42:18.971 --> 42:23.584
â™ª Coming down on a sunny day?
