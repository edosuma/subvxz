WEBVTT

00:07.941 --> 00:09.375
- I hope you're all hungry!

00:09.377 --> 00:10.609
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.911
- It is so nice
to sit down to dinner

00:12.913 --> 00:14.680
like a normal family.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.448
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.583
Hit it, sis.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.288
I'll get forks.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.759
- I'll get the lemonade!

00:32.899 --> 00:34.700
- And I'll eat dessert.

00:35.468 --> 00:37.536
- Max, that's for later.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.538
- Says who?

00:39.540 --> 00:41.140
- Me. Now let it go.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.409
Suit yourself.

00:47.048 --> 00:48.247
- Wall cake!

00:48.249 --> 00:48.947
- That's it.

00:48.949 --> 00:52.484
For once, could we enjoy
a nice, relaxing dinner

00:52.486 --> 00:54.686
without you kids
using your superpowers?

00:54.688 --> 00:55.788
- No problem.
- I'm sorry.

00:55.790 --> 00:57.790
- Whatever.
- Sure, dad.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.158
- Great.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.459
Now...

01:00.461 --> 01:01.994
Where is my Peruvian
hot sauce?

01:01.996 --> 01:04.563
- You're gonna fly to Peru
to get hot sauce, aren't you?

01:04.565 --> 01:07.166
- Thunder man!
Away!

01:10.271 --> 01:14.039
- That is never not funny.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.679
- ¶ What you see
is not what you get

01:20.681 --> 01:23.916
¶ living our lives
with a secret

01:23.918 --> 01:26.752
¶ we fit right in,
bet you never guessed

01:26.754 --> 01:30.222
¶ 'cause we're living our lives
just like all the rest

01:30.224 --> 01:33.659
¶ a picture-perfect family
is what we try to be

01:33.661 --> 01:36.895
¶ look closer, you might see
the crazy things we do

01:36.897 --> 01:40.132
¶ this isn't make-believe,
it's our reality

01:40.134 --> 01:43.869
¶ just your average family,
trying to be normal

01:43.871 --> 01:45.637
¶ and stay out of trouble

01:53.146 --> 01:55.414
- okay.
See you then, cherry.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.549
I know, I can't wait, either.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.784
Bye.

01:58.786 --> 01:59.651
Ooh!

01:59.653 --> 02:02.121
I'm having a girls' night
with cherry.

02:02.123 --> 02:02.888
- I don't get it.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.190
You and Max have more powers
than all of us,

02:05.192 --> 02:08.660
and you're excited about
seeing a friend?

02:08.662 --> 02:10.795
- You don't get it
because your only friends

02:10.798 --> 02:13.665
are the bacteria
in your armpits.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.835
- Yeah, and they want to be
friends with you too.

02:16.837 --> 02:17.703
- Eww!

02:17.705 --> 02:19.571
- Come on, guys.
Be nice.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.940
You should love
your siblings.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.942
Except him.
He's evil.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.911
- Come on, sis,
you're my twin.

02:25.913 --> 02:26.745
Where's the love?

02:26.747 --> 02:29.948
- Uh, the love died
when you beheaded my dolls

02:29.950 --> 02:31.517
when we were five.

02:31.519 --> 02:32.751
- Oh, yeah.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.453
Totally worth it.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.488
Now, if you'll excuse me,

02:36.490 --> 02:39.925
I'm off to go do
supervillain stuff in my lair.

02:41.227 --> 02:46.198
- It's not a lair
if it has a nightlight.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.533
- Supervillain?

02:47.535 --> 02:49.635
More like a super-cutie!

02:49.637 --> 02:50.969
Mwah!

02:50.971 --> 02:51.670
- Where you going?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.939
- I am taking your mom
out to dinner.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.841
- So Max and Phoebe
are babysitting you.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.576
They're really
looking forward to it.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.511
- Don't touch your armpits.
Don't laser your brother.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.447
Don't take over the world.
Don't have more children.

03:02.449 --> 03:05.384
Good night, everybody!

03:08.421 --> 03:09.388
- Wow, mom.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.123
You still got it.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.057
- Where are you going?

03:12.059 --> 03:14.993
I need you and Max
to babysit tonight.

03:14.995 --> 03:15.527
What?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.262
- Mom, I was going
to cherry's tonight.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.932
- Yeah, and I was gonna
not babysit.

03:19.934 --> 03:23.902
- Well, now you're not
not babysitting.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.103
Wait...

03:25.105 --> 03:26.838
Yeah, that's right.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.942
- Well, uh, can't a neighbor

03:29.944 --> 03:31.043
watch Billy and Nora?
- Yeah.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.178
- And risk the kids
exposing their powers

03:33.180 --> 03:34.513
to a non-superhero?

03:34.515 --> 03:37.549
- They won't, they're
really responsible now.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.218
- Dance! Dance, I say!

03:39.220 --> 03:41.787
- Ow! Cut it out!
- Ha ha ha!

03:45.825 --> 03:48.360
- Please, mom,
cherry is the only friend

03:48.362 --> 03:50.295
I've managed to make
since we moved here.

03:50.297 --> 03:52.130
- That's one more
than I thought she'd make.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.499
- I'm sorry, honey,
but your father and I

03:54.501 --> 03:56.034
gave up crime fighting
so you kids

03:56.036 --> 03:57.869
could have
a normal childhood.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.538
- That's right,
which is too bad,

03:59.540 --> 04:01.139
'cause I still got it!

04:01.141 --> 04:03.909
- Yeah, and a little extra.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.444
- This is the worst.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.311
You know,
sometimes I wish

04:06.313 --> 04:08.280
we didn't even have
superpowers.

04:08.282 --> 04:11.216
- I'm sorry, Phoebe.

04:12.352 --> 04:13.585
Come on, Hank.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.820
- To the thunder-mobile!

04:14.822 --> 04:17.122
- Minivan.
- To the thunder-minivan!

04:17.124 --> 04:20.625
- No, it's just a mini--
Whatever.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.995
- Agh!
How can I become

04:22.997 --> 04:24.696
the world's greatest
supervillain

04:24.698 --> 04:29.167
if I have to babysit
zippy and lasergirl?

04:29.169 --> 04:30.369
Wait a minute...

04:30.371 --> 04:34.306
You guys
are way too cool

04:34.308 --> 04:35.007
for babysitting.

04:35.009 --> 04:39.378
How's you like to assist me
on my latest project?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.213
- Sure.
- Guess so.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.547
- All right.

04:42.549 --> 04:43.348
Phoebe!

04:43.350 --> 04:44.983
You deserve a girl's night.

04:44.985 --> 04:48.320
So why don't I babysit
Billy and Nora

04:48.322 --> 04:50.722
while you invite
your friend over here?

04:50.724 --> 04:51.390
- Are you nuts?

04:51.392 --> 04:53.258
What about dad's
number one rule?

04:53.260 --> 04:56.228
- Everything goes better
with gravy?

04:56.230 --> 04:58.497
- No non-supes in the house.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.932
I'm calling cherry
to cancel.

05:00.934 --> 05:01.566
- You're right.

05:01.568 --> 05:06.271
Of course, she'll probably
find a new best friend.

05:06.273 --> 05:10.742
And you can make loneliness
your new best friend.

05:12.712 --> 05:13.979
- Wait!

05:13.981 --> 05:15.914
You guys promise
that if cherry comes,

05:15.916 --> 05:17.115
you won't use your powers?

05:17.117 --> 05:19.885
- Of course not.
- Of course we won't.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.953
- Ow!

05:21.955 --> 05:23.622
- She's not here yet.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.794
- Okay...I'll do it.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.429
- Great, let's text her.

05:31.597 --> 05:33.832
Hey!
- "'Sup, girl?

05:33.834 --> 05:34.766
Pheebs here."

05:34.768 --> 05:36.168
- You're texting as me?

05:36.170 --> 05:39.304
- "Totes obvi
we should hang at my crib."

05:39.306 --> 05:41.773
See you at 7:00.
As if."

05:41.775 --> 05:45.477
Smiley face
with a party hat.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.178
- Darn it.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.613
That is exactly
what I would have written.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.783
- All right, guys,
to the Max lair!

05:54.053 --> 05:55.420
Whoo!

05:55.422 --> 05:58.757
- Billy in the hole!

06:01.761 --> 06:04.296
- Glad we got rid
of the boy germs,

06:04.298 --> 06:06.631
am I right, pheebs?

06:07.767 --> 06:11.536
Yeah, I'll just go.

06:15.908 --> 06:18.477
- Whee!

06:19.512 --> 06:21.113
Hey, where's Nora?

06:21.115 --> 06:23.014
- Aah!
- Aah!

06:23.016 --> 06:24.850
- Ooh!

06:26.686 --> 06:28.387
Okay, I'll be right back.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.322
Don't touch anything.

06:30.324 --> 06:32.224
Right.

06:32.226 --> 06:35.160
- Let's touch stuff.
- Yeah!

06:35.862 --> 06:39.731
- "Press here
to destroy pluto"?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.366
Mm.

06:44.405 --> 06:47.205
Must be broken.

06:48.107 --> 06:50.776
- "Dr. colosso"?

06:50.778 --> 06:51.810
- Gah!

06:51.812 --> 06:53.311
- Aah!
- Aah!

06:53.313 --> 06:55.414
- Aah!
- Aah!

06:55.416 --> 06:57.582
- Close it.
- Yep.

06:58.117 --> 06:59.518
- I shouldn't be here, Nora.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.687
The Junior supertroops motto
is "do no evil."

07:02.689 --> 07:06.858
- Okay, who wants to help me
carve my initials in the moon?

07:06.860 --> 07:09.127
- Ooh! I do!
Me! Pick me!

07:09.129 --> 07:11.029
Me, me.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.101
- Good job, Billy.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.770
Keep it nice and steady,
Nora.

07:19.906 --> 07:22.073
This is awesome.

07:22.075 --> 07:25.911
- You're the best babysitter
ever!

07:28.514 --> 07:29.381
- Interesting decor.

07:29.383 --> 07:32.984
Sort of a baseball/viking
junkyard theme.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.387
- Come on, Hank,
this is fun.

07:35.389 --> 07:36.655
Now that we moved
to hiddenville,

07:36.657 --> 07:38.924
we can go out
like a normal couple.

07:38.926 --> 07:39.724
- Yeah, you're right.

07:39.726 --> 07:42.127
Maybe I won't miss
being you-know-who.

07:42.129 --> 07:46.364
Savin' lives, my cape
billowing in the wind and...

07:46.366 --> 07:49.901
Oh, look.
The menu's sticky.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.069
- Honey, bad news.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.872
The thunder man we hired
for the party can't make it.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.140
His car broke down.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.241
- Barb, did you hear that?

07:56.243 --> 07:58.610
The guy playing thunder man's
a no-show

07:58.612 --> 08:00.445
for that kid's birthday.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.346
- Aww.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.949
Ooh, jalapeno poppers.

08:03.951 --> 08:07.352
- No, don't you see?
I'm thunder man.

08:07.354 --> 08:10.255
I can save that precious
little girl's party.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.923
- That's a boy.
- Yeah, whatever.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.692
- Hey, we're
in hiddenville now.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.161
You can't go around exposing
your secret identity.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.530
- I won't be--they'll think
I'm a party entertainer

08:18.532 --> 08:20.465
who got his car
working again.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.900
- Hank, you're not even
dressed for it.

08:21.902 --> 08:26.104
It's not as if you happen
to have your supersuit...

08:27.240 --> 08:28.607
Under your clothes.

08:28.609 --> 08:32.043
- Did I hear
it's someone's birthday?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.546
- Thunder man!
- Thunder man!

08:42.722 --> 08:44.022
- Alert, alert.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.124
Non-supe approaching.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.798
Sorry, mom and dad,
but I need a life.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.774
- Hi!
- Hi, pheebs!

09:02.776 --> 09:04.543
Double selfie.

09:05.979 --> 09:10.749
Oh, my gosh,
this place is bonkers.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.918
How have I never
been here before?

09:12.920 --> 09:13.552
- I don't know.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.654
I mean, it's not like
I'm hiding anything.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.390
- Well, of course not.
We're best friends.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.224
- We are?

09:19.226 --> 09:20.659
- Duh.
Speaking of which,

09:20.661 --> 09:24.696
who is ready for the most
cray-mazing girls' night ever?

09:24.698 --> 09:25.263
- Talk to me.

09:25.265 --> 09:28.266
- First, we update
our double selfies.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.070
Then, we rock to the new

09:32.072 --> 09:35.040
<i>dance your thang off</i>
video game.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.609
Rated "f," for "funky."

09:42.015 --> 09:44.649
And it all starts...

09:44.651 --> 09:46.518
Now.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.888
- Why'd you do that?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.022
- Do what?

09:51.024 --> 09:52.457
- This.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.693
- I didn't do this.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.727
- Yeah. You did this.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.163
- I think I'd remember
if I did this.

09:58.165 --> 09:58.730
- Phoebe--

09:58.732 --> 10:00.465
- hey, who wants
to make brownies?

10:00.467 --> 10:02.667
I know I do.

10:10.142 --> 10:10.642
- What?

10:10.644 --> 10:12.577
- What are we doing next,
Max?

10:12.579 --> 10:14.713
- Leaving me alone.

10:18.819 --> 10:19.818
Fine.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.420
Play with something
in here.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.157
- Check it out.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.127
"Nose hairalyzer."

10:32.198 --> 10:34.699
- Is that nose hair?

10:34.701 --> 10:37.335
Awesome!

10:37.337 --> 10:39.771
- Can I see it?

10:43.976 --> 10:48.046
Today, I am a man.

10:50.516 --> 10:53.151
- All right, lady,
spill it.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.152
Who do you have
a crush on?

10:54.154 --> 10:56.287
- I don't know, there's
no one really special.

10:56.289 --> 10:59.290
- Cole Campbell?
- Sweet cheese, yes!

11:00.259 --> 11:02.227
- You should totally
call him.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.561
- You know I'm too shy
for that.

11:03.563 --> 11:07.499
- Which is why
I'm the perfect best friend.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.734
- Cherry...
What are you doing?

11:09.736 --> 11:10.835
Don't you look up his number.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.104
Don't you call it.
Don't you let it ring.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.706
Don't you hand
that phone to--

11:14.708 --> 11:16.775
hey, Cole.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.110
It's Phoebe...Thunderman.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.045
From home room?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.079
I was just calling to--

11:21.081 --> 11:22.981
- see if you want
to hang out sometime.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.216
- I can't believe you.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.484
You would?

11:26.486 --> 11:28.920
Yeah.
Next week's great.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.755
Okay, bye.

11:30.757 --> 11:31.690
He is so cute!

11:31.692 --> 11:34.659
- Yeah, you might
want to hang that up.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.230
- Give it back!
- No!

11:39.232 --> 11:41.599
- Billy!
- What's going on here?

11:41.601 --> 11:42.634
- I saw it first!

11:42.636 --> 11:44.736
- You want it?
Here!

11:46.505 --> 11:48.273
- Ha! Missed me.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.841
- You guys,
stop it right now.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.810
- Billy, cut it out!

11:53.112 --> 11:55.914
- That's it!

11:55.916 --> 11:57.582
- Whoa.

11:57.584 --> 12:01.286
- Oh...My...

12:01.288 --> 12:02.787
Wow.

12:05.091 --> 12:08.159
- So...This is fun.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.968
- Your siblings are floating
in midair!

12:16.970 --> 12:18.336
- No, they're not.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.609
- You have superpowers.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.848
You have superpowers and--

12:29.850 --> 12:31.649
and you didn't tell me?

12:32.384 --> 12:35.286
- Cherry, there is a very
simple explanation

12:35.288 --> 12:36.755
for all this.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.190
And that explanation is...

12:39.192 --> 12:42.227
Uh...

12:46.233 --> 12:48.266
- Um...You froze
your friend.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.201
- I know I froze my friend!

12:51.437 --> 12:52.804
Why are you smiling?

12:52.806 --> 12:54.239
- I don't smile.

12:54.241 --> 12:54.739
I smirk.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.742
And I'm doing it because
you did something bad.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.944
- Yeah, and when I tell dad
that you're the one

12:59.946 --> 13:00.612
who invited cherry here,

13:00.614 --> 13:02.180
he'll make us all
move again.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.414
Smirk on that, smirky.

13:03.416 --> 13:07.152
- Okay, this isn't
so fun anymore.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.521
- Are we really
gonna have to move?

13:09.523 --> 13:10.722
- Don't worry, Nora.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.290
Max and I will solve this.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.260
- You two are going
to work together?

13:16.595 --> 13:19.297
Let's get packin'.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.565
- Guys, guys, guys, wait.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.134
There is a very simple
solution.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.771
I just wipe her memory
with my Brian melt 3000.

13:26.773 --> 13:29.240
- You are not wiping
my best friend's brain.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.143
- She's friends with you
and is named after a fruit.

13:32.145 --> 13:36.014
There's probably not much
there to wipe.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.550
- No, we just need
to thaw cherry out

13:38.552 --> 13:40.785
and give her an explanation
for what she saw.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.253
- Hey, I like that.
- Thank you.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.856
- You'll fail,
it'll be hilarious,

13:44.858 --> 13:47.926
and I still get
to wipe her brain.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.027
Uh-oh.

13:49.029 --> 13:52.063
I feel a smirk coming on.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.432
Oh, yeah.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.534
There it is.

13:58.637 --> 14:01.272
- Metal bat!

14:03.176 --> 14:04.742
- Ohh! Oh!

14:05.979 --> 14:08.146
That was amazing.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.782
- Cement block!

14:13.486 --> 14:17.422
- Thunder man, can I talk
to you for a second?

14:17.424 --> 14:18.289
- Yeah, Barb, what's up?

14:18.291 --> 14:21.926
- Super strength? Are you trying
to get us exposed?

14:21.928 --> 14:22.727
- Honey, don't worry.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.596
Everybody thinks
I'm a party entertainer

14:24.598 --> 14:25.997
using fake props.

14:25.999 --> 14:26.698
The kids get a thrill,

14:26.700 --> 14:30.101
I get to bust out a little
of the old thunder risk-free.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.770
It's all good, Barb.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.739
- Fly me, thunder man!

14:34.741 --> 14:35.907
- Fly you?

14:35.909 --> 14:37.442
Surprise attack!
Aah!

14:37.444 --> 14:40.612
Get him off me!
Get him off!

14:43.483 --> 14:44.983
- Awesome.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.622
- Okay, so we're all good
on the plan?

14:50.624 --> 14:52.190
- Yep.
- Lame.

14:52.192 --> 14:55.927
- Why do you always assume
your plans are better than mine?

14:55.929 --> 14:57.896
- I have a supervillain lab.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.665
You put glitter
on your homework.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.433
I think
it's a safe assumption.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.102
- You'll see.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.571
This'll work.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.408
So...Let's hear it.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.976
If you don't
have superpowers,

15:11.978 --> 15:15.580
how do you explain those kids
rising into the air?

15:15.582 --> 15:16.915
Simple.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.083
They happen to have been
rehearsing

15:19.085 --> 15:22.220
for their new
school musical...

15:23.555 --> 15:25.590
<i>Cannibal squids from Mars.</i>

15:25.592 --> 15:28.593
- I'll get you,
cannibal squid!

15:28.595 --> 15:30.728
- Never, space overlord!

15:30.730 --> 15:34.032
¶ oh, why can't squids
and overlords

15:34.034 --> 15:36.601
¶ be friends?

15:40.372 --> 15:41.005
- There.

15:41.007 --> 15:44.042
Isn't that a completely
believable explanation?

15:44.044 --> 15:45.410
- I guess so?

15:45.412 --> 15:48.079
- Good, then let's forget
about this whole

15:48.081 --> 15:48.947
superpowers thing.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.915
- Oh! The brownies.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.016
- Brownies?

15:54.521 --> 15:56.654
- I'll cut 'em in squares.

16:02.928 --> 16:04.896
- Whoops. Heh.

16:04.898 --> 16:06.364
Brownie?

16:06.366 --> 16:10.034
- You all have superpowers.

16:10.036 --> 16:12.103
Wait till I post this
on my blog!

16:12.105 --> 16:13.071
- I got this one.

16:16.775 --> 16:18.576
You can't have all the fun.

16:22.915 --> 16:23.982
- I can't believe this!

16:23.984 --> 16:26.384
Now cherry's gonna tell
everyone at school

16:26.386 --> 16:29.020
that we have powers,
and dad'll make us move again.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.489
- Where am I gonna get
another supervillain lair?

16:31.491 --> 16:34.292
- Where am I gonna get
a new best friend.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.893
- That's it!
We are not moving.

16:35.895 --> 16:40.131
Not if the brain melt 3000
has anything to say about it.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.799
- You are not
wiping her brain.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.768
- Fine, I'll just
launch her into space.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.870
- Are you nuts?
- Oh, no one's gonna miss her.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.638
- You always do this!
- We gotta do something.

16:48.775 --> 16:49.540
- Alert, alert.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.942
Parents approaching house.

16:50.944 --> 16:53.478
- I added parent alert
this morning.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.013
- Nice.
- Also...

16:55.015 --> 16:56.681
Aah!

16:56.683 --> 16:58.383
- Mom and dad are pulling in!

16:58.385 --> 17:00.218
- We can't let them
see cherry!

17:00.220 --> 17:01.519
- Oh.

17:02.788 --> 17:05.223
- Put her in the closet.
- Okay.

17:11.997 --> 17:14.464
- Everyone act natural.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.242
Easy.

17:24.243 --> 17:25.443
- Hey, mom.
Hey, dad.

17:25.444 --> 17:26.176
- 'Sup, guys?

17:26.179 --> 17:27.712
Good evening, parents.

17:27.714 --> 17:31.282
I do not know why
you'd be suspicious.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.653
- Hank, I'll get you
a heating pad

17:35.655 --> 17:36.821
in the closet.

17:36.823 --> 17:37.822
- Wait!

17:37.824 --> 17:40.491
Because I have a splinter.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.394
- Oh. Let me take
a look in the light.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.537
I don't see anything.
- Look harder!

17:53.539 --> 17:57.642
- I'll just get an ice pack
from the kitchen.

17:57.644 --> 17:58.843
- I'll get it, dad.

17:58.845 --> 18:03.147
Junior supertroopers
are trained to help the elderly.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.849
- I think I can handle it.

18:07.553 --> 18:08.453
Upstairs.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.422
- I gotta get my glasses
upstairs.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.423
- No!

18:12.425 --> 18:15.193
Did I say splinter?

18:15.195 --> 18:16.627
I meant a cold.

18:16.629 --> 18:17.495
Ah-choo!

18:17.497 --> 18:19.097
- Hey, honey...

18:23.402 --> 18:26.404
Honey...Which cabinet
is the--

18:26.406 --> 18:27.705
what is that?

18:27.707 --> 18:28.906
- What is that?

18:28.908 --> 18:31.242
- I know.
Ugly, right?

18:31.244 --> 18:35.146
I am so done with
the lamp of the month club.

18:37.000 --> 18:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:45.624 --> 18:48.526
- Phoebe, isn't this
your friend cherry?

18:48.528 --> 18:50.161
- Mom, dad, I can explain.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.563
See, you wouldn't let me
go to cherry's,

18:52.565 --> 18:53.564
so invited cherry here,

18:53.566 --> 18:55.733
but then she saw me
use powers,

18:55.735 --> 18:58.636
so I kind of froze her.

19:00.772 --> 19:02.006
- Really?

19:02.008 --> 19:02.807
Honesty.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.075
That's what
you're going with?

19:04.077 --> 19:07.478
- You let a non-supe
in the house?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.346
- I know.
I screwed up.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.515
I broke the rules,
and I'm really sorry.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.584
I just...
Wanted to have a friend.

19:13.586 --> 19:14.619
- I'm sorry, too.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.588
Start packing, everybody.
- We have to move?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.223
- We're moving?
- I don't wanna move!

19:19.225 --> 19:20.158
- Sorry,
but we have no choice.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.393
We have to keep
our powers a secret.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.296
Although I know
showing them off sometimes

19:25.298 --> 19:27.265
can be tempting.

19:31.104 --> 19:33.838
Well, at least I had
a best friend

19:33.840 --> 19:35.840
for a little while.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.410
- Mom, dad, wait.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.280
This isn't Phoebe's fault.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.514
It's mine.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.815
I texted her friend
to come over

19:44.817 --> 19:46.918
so I could go
work in the lair.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.420
So if you're gonna
punish anyone, punish me.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.555
- Phoebe let her
in the house.

19:50.557 --> 19:53.257
- Because she wanted
a friend.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.292
Come on, dad.

19:54.294 --> 19:58.329
You moved us here so we could
live normal lives.

19:58.331 --> 20:01.232
Well...Don't ruin
Phoebe's chances

20:01.234 --> 20:03.334
because of something
that I did.

20:05.604 --> 20:06.704
- I'll tell you what.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.473
I will pretend this whole night
never happened

20:09.475 --> 20:12.510
if you and your sister
can figure out a way

20:12.512 --> 20:13.678
to fix this.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.580
- We're toast.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.084
- Wait!

20:20.086 --> 20:21.485
It's a long shot, but...

20:21.487 --> 20:23.788
I know something
we can try.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.926
¶ so if you're
ever in space

20:28.928 --> 20:30.695
¶ drop by
and visit our place

20:30.697 --> 20:34.098
¶ ask for
the cannibal squids

20:37.036 --> 20:41.038
- ¶ we hope you're not
too hard to digest

20:41.040 --> 20:48.579
¶ that's the end
of our show

20:52.684 --> 20:55.686
- so...You're all
in the school musical,

20:55.688 --> 20:59.523
and all that weird stuff I saw
was just special effects?

20:59.525 --> 21:00.858
Yep.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.628
- You buyin' that?

21:04.596 --> 21:08.266
- Of course I'm buying that!

21:08.268 --> 21:10.167
You guys are so cool!

21:10.169 --> 21:11.168
Group selfie!
- Okay!

21:11.170 --> 21:13.104
Well, it's getting late.
Thanks for coming by.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.339
- You're great, Max.
I knew Phoebe had a brother,

21:15.341 --> 21:17.375
but she never said
he was so talented.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.276
- Yeah, whatever, orange.

21:18.278 --> 21:21.646
- It's cherry.
- Okay, bye.

21:23.181 --> 21:24.448
- What a night.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.916
Come on, kids.
Time for bed.

21:25.918 --> 21:29.186
- Can Max and Phoebe
babysit us every night?

21:29.188 --> 21:31.022
No!

21:31.024 --> 21:33.891
- Think I'm gonna try
one of those brownies

21:33.893 --> 21:36.127
in the kitchen.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.799
- That was a really nice thing
you did for me.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.466
- Yeah, listen.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.734
I have a reputation
to uphold,

21:43.736 --> 21:46.404
so if we can keep this whole
nice thing on the down low.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.372
- Nuh-uh--
you did a nice thing,

21:48.374 --> 21:50.808
and I'm never gonna
forget it.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.277
Try to melt my brain,
and I'll cram that thing

21:53.279 --> 21:54.712
down your smirk hole.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.448
- Mmm.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.216
You know what these need?

21:59.218 --> 22:00.751
Macadamia nuts.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.486
You're gonna fly

22:02.488 --> 22:04.188
all the way to Hawaii
and get--

22:04.190 --> 22:08.793
- thunder man!
Away!

22:11.463 --> 22:14.098
- We have a weird family.
- Yeah, we do.

22:14.100 --> 22:18.769
- Why does it say "Nora rules"
on the moon?

22:18.771 --> 22:21.472
- Nora!

22:22.305 --> 22:28.154
