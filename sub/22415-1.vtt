00:29.964 --> 00:30.729
It's time.

00:30.798 --> 00:31.797
Close the door.

00:35.803 --> 00:36.535
Cold feet?

00:36.604 --> 00:37.403
Torn veil.

00:37.471 --> 00:38.537
Grab my bag.

00:45.980 --> 00:46.812
Scissors?

00:49.016 --> 00:49.715
Needle and thread?

00:49.784 --> 00:50.449
Mmmhmm.

00:50.518 --> 00:51.417
Wiring.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.552
<i>Is everything alright in there?</i>

00:53.621 --> 00:55.454
Yes, just a moment.

00:55.523 --> 00:56.221
Wiring.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.289
I'm not seeing it.

00:59.326 --> 01:00.092
Got it.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.126
Thank you.

01:01.629 --> 01:02.327
Great.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.736
Alright, maybe some lips.

01:11.338 --> 01:12.504
Just a bit.

01:16.310 --> 01:20.345
And now, right as rain.

01:25.086 --> 01:27.686
It's beautiful.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.788
No, you're beautiful.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.523
But remember,
we just fixed you,

01:31.592 --> 01:33.926
so no crying until
after the kiss, ok?

01:44.371 --> 01:48.273
<i>A wedding is a dream turned
into reality</i>

01:48.342 --> 01:50.676
<i>built on hundreds of decisions</i>

01:50.744 --> 01:53.278
<i>that need to fall perfectly
into place</i>

01:53.347 --> 01:55.214
<i>and all at the right time.</i>

01:55.282 --> 01:57.649
<i>And when it works
it's magic.</i>

01:57.718 --> 02:00.119
<i>But there's a reason why
75 percent of all couples</i>

02:00.187 --> 02:02.888
<i>consider eloping when
planning their wedding.</i>

02:04.258 --> 02:07.960
<i>Because making a dream
come true is hard work.</i>

02:09.530 --> 02:10.863
<i>And that's why
they call me.</i>

02:12.233 --> 02:14.867
Love's in Bloom Events,
Sarah Bloom speaking.

02:14.935 --> 02:18.871
<i>I help couples turn their dreams
into reality.</i>

02:18.939 --> 02:20.372
<i>I offer perspective</i>

02:20.441 --> 02:23.509
<i>when it can be hard
to see the truth.</i>

02:23.577 --> 02:27.379
<i>I broaden horizons when
a choice seems a little narrow.</i>

02:28.582 --> 02:31.116
The chandeliers will fit
nicely with your theme.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.719
The light will be cascading
through the windows

02:33.787 --> 02:36.088
and then the stage for the band
right right there.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.589
<i>And I show what's possible.</i>

02:37.658 --> 02:38.790
I love it.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.492
<i>Even if there's nothing there.</i>

02:44.298 --> 02:46.398
Because, for at least
one day,

02:46.467 --> 02:50.769
I believe that everyone deserves
to have their dreams come true.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.541
Well first off, all of us at
Wedding Insider magazine

02:55.609 --> 02:57.609
are very impressed
with your work.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.844
Thank you.

02:58.913 --> 03:01.280
And, as you know, I did speak
with my editors.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.814
Yeah.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.617
But they won't be able to
feature you in the next issue.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.153
It's nothing personal, they
just never feature anyone

03:08.222 --> 03:09.821
from their first submission.

03:09.823 --> 03:10.355
I...

03:11.225 --> 03:12.758
I didn't know that.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.092
So don't disappear,

03:14.161 --> 03:16.895
I'm sure we'll be talking
again very soon.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.197
It's, nice to meet you.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.598
It was nice meeting you,
Sarah Bloom.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.866
And listen, if anything
big comes up,

03:20.935 --> 03:22.501
be sure to let us know, ok?

03:22.570 --> 03:23.268
Absolutely.

03:23.337 --> 03:23.969
<i>Thank you, Payton.</i>

03:24.038 --> 03:25.204
My pleasure, Emma.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.610
How did it go?

03:31.679 --> 03:35.214
Well, they never accept anyone
on their first submission.

03:35.282 --> 03:35.814
Really?

03:35.883 --> 03:36.748
Yeah.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.583
I didn't know that.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.585
Neither did I.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.420
There are other publications.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.322
Yeah, but they're not
Wedding Insider magazine,

03:43.390 --> 03:44.489
you know that.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.058
I mean, we get that cover,

03:46.126 --> 03:47.492
we're gonna get calls
from all around the world.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.595
That's the game changer.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.963
We need that.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.431
So what're you gonna do?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.769
I'm gonna do
what I always do.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.738
Put my head down,
keep working.

03:59.807 --> 04:00.672
Mmmhmm.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.076
Speaking of work,

04:04.144 --> 04:05.344
when is our next meeting?

04:05.412 --> 04:08.447
They should be here
any minute.

04:08.515 --> 04:09.414
Good, good.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.916
And I forgot to tell you,

04:10.985 --> 04:13.218
you got a message from
Scott August yesterday.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.920
Scott August.
Scott August.

04:14.989 --> 04:16.154
Do I-do I know him?

04:16.223 --> 04:17.422
Not really.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.190
He's the date you stood up
two days ago

04:19.260 --> 04:21.660
and he wanted to let you know
there wouldn't be a second.

04:21.728 --> 04:22.561
I totally forgot.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.929
<i>You always forget.</i>

04:23.998 --> 04:24.997
Well, I was working.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.632
Because you're always working.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.200
When are you gonna realize
that it's hard to plan

04:28.269 --> 04:30.569
your own wedding when you're
already married to your work?

04:30.638 --> 04:31.570
Ok, I'll keep all that in mind.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.905
Look...
did you hear that?

04:33.974 --> 04:35.407
I think it's our next client.

04:35.476 --> 04:35.974
I'll get it.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.342
Thank you.

04:43.217 --> 04:45.017
Abby, Barbara, welcome.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.119
It's very nice to meet
both of you.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.121
Tom, my fiancé, is running
a little late

04:49.189 --> 04:50.856
but he should be here soon.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.224
Ok.

04:52.293 --> 04:55.394
First off, thank you for meeting
us on such short notice.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.030
The reason we wanted
to meet so quickly

04:58.098 --> 05:01.133
is because Tom and I got engaged
last Wednesday.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.735
Congratulations.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.504
You know, it's very smart of
you getting a jump

05:05.572 --> 05:06.772
on the planning.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.075
It helps to minimize
any unnecessary anxiety

05:10.144 --> 05:11.710
when you're on
the home stretch.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.813
But what if you're
already there?

05:14.882 --> 05:16.315
I'm sorry?

05:16.383 --> 05:20.118
What my mother means to say
is Tom is doing his residency

05:20.187 --> 05:21.687
at Columbia Hospital.

05:21.755 --> 05:25.324
He's also in the army reserves
and as fate would have it

05:25.392 --> 05:27.259
the day after we got engaged
we found out

05:27.328 --> 05:29.961
that he was being called up
at the end of the month.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.396
Wait, this month?

05:31.465 --> 05:32.297
This month.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.966
Which only gives us two weeks.

05:35.035 --> 05:38.704
So we're here to see
if that's even possible.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.972
Well, you're right,
I mean two weeks is...

05:41.041 --> 05:42.674
is not a lot of time.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.312
But I believe
anything's possible.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.414
But I'd be lying
if I didn't tell you

05:49.483 --> 05:50.782
there may be some difficulties.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.384
I think they should wait.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.852
Mom.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.555
You shouldn't have to risk
the wedding you want.

05:56.623 --> 05:57.289
But we don't wanna wait.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.523
We wanna do it now.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.958
I know, Abby, but...

06:00.027 --> 06:00.992
<i>Mom, please.</i>

06:01.061 --> 06:03.528
Look, if I may?

06:03.597 --> 06:05.597
How many guests are we
talking about here?

06:05.666 --> 06:07.099
40, maybe 50.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.133
Mmmhmm.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.368
And I would like
to keep it simple.

06:09.436 --> 06:12.938
And I have a specific list
of ideas

06:13.006 --> 06:14.239
that I would like incorporated.

06:14.308 --> 06:16.408
Ok, well, first things first.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.243
I mean, considering
our time frame

06:18.312 --> 06:20.712
I think we need to think
about finding a venue

06:20.781 --> 06:22.748
that's still available.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.049
We've got that covered.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.851
We wanna get married
at Tom's family farm

06:25.919 --> 06:27.886
in Williamstown, Massachusetts.

06:30.324 --> 06:32.657
I'm sorry,
did you say Williamstown?

06:32.726 --> 06:34.259
Yes!

06:34.328 --> 06:36.828
I... I know, but it's beautiful
and I've always dreamed of

06:36.897 --> 06:38.563
having a country wedding.

06:38.632 --> 06:39.965
No, no, no, no, no.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.066
I... I think that that's great,
it's just that...

06:42.136 --> 06:43.935
This is kinda crazy.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.971
I was raised in Williamstown.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.606
Really?

06:47.674 --> 06:49.408
Do you know Tom's family?

06:49.476 --> 06:51.877
It's the Nichols' farm.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.246
Your fiancé is Tom Nichols?

06:55.449 --> 06:57.015
Should my ears be burning?

06:58.385 --> 06:59.484
So sorry I'm late.

06:59.553 --> 07:00.385
<i>Hey, sweetie.</i>

07:00.454 --> 07:01.686
<i>Hey.</i>

07:01.755 --> 07:02.687
Hey, mom.

07:04.091 --> 07:04.990
I'm Tom Nichols.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.158
You must be Sarah.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.225
Hi, Tom.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.493
What've I missed?

07:09.963 --> 07:12.097
Only the fact that you two
have already met.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.368
What?

07:16.437 --> 07:19.604
Tom, it's Sarah Bloom
from Williamstown.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.974
Hey, Tom.

07:23.043 --> 07:23.875
Sarah?

07:23.944 --> 07:25.477
Yeah.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.579
It's been a long time, Tom.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.047
I'm sorry, I can't believe this.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.483
This is blowing my mind.

07:31.552 --> 07:35.520
Sarah and my brother used
to...

07:35.589 --> 07:38.657
We-we dated.

07:38.725 --> 07:39.224
That's it.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.326
You dated David.

07:41.395 --> 07:42.027
The farmer?

07:42.095 --> 07:44.029
You dated someone?

07:44.097 --> 07:45.363
Yes.

07:45.432 --> 07:48.133
To all that.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.202
Well, I think we found
our wedding planner.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.404
Excuse me?

07:52.473 --> 07:53.772
Well, how could this be
any better?

07:53.841 --> 07:55.607
I mean, she knows us.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.709
She knows the town,
she knows the farm.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.011
You were practically a member
of our family growing up.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.581
If anybody should be planning
this wedding,

08:02.649 --> 08:04.216
I think it should be you.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.385
<i>But what about David?</i>

08:07.454 --> 08:08.453
What about him?

08:08.522 --> 08:10.489
Well, he works the farm now,

08:10.557 --> 08:11.756
won't that be a problem

08:11.825 --> 08:14.559
considering the two of
you were sweethearts?

08:14.628 --> 08:15.026
No.

08:15.095 --> 08:15.794
No, no.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.462
We were-we were kids.

08:17.531 --> 08:18.597
It was such a long time ago.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.465
You don't have anything
to worry about.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.734
I... I do understand
your concern

08:22.803 --> 08:24.703
but the more important
thing here is

08:24.771 --> 08:26.304
that you need someone
with the skills

08:26.373 --> 08:29.341
that can pull off this wedding
in two weeks time.

08:29.409 --> 08:34.078
And I'm telling you with
complete certainty, Barbara,

08:34.147 --> 08:35.914
I can do that.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.049
Great.

10:04.905 --> 10:05.303
Morning.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.204
Morning.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.908
Ready for this?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.676
Shouldn't I be asking you
that question?

10:11.745 --> 10:13.111
What, because of David?

10:14.281 --> 10:15.213
I haven't thought
about him once.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.214
He's not on Facebook.

10:16.283 --> 10:16.781
Yeah, I know.

10:16.850 --> 10:17.749
I knew it!

10:17.818 --> 10:19.384
No-ok, yes.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.286
Ok. I was a little curious,
I looked him up.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.321
That's-that's not what
I'm focused on here, ok?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.690
I'm focused on the fact
that the King family

10:25.759 --> 10:29.427
and their real estate empire
makes them New York society.

10:29.496 --> 10:30.729
If we get this wedding right

10:30.797 --> 10:32.597
it could steer a lot of
big business our way, ok?

10:32.666 --> 10:34.065
So we just need to...

10:35.702 --> 10:36.601
Keep our heads on straight.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.036
Ok, I understand.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.572
You might wanna read this.

10:43.877 --> 10:47.145
<i>It's Barbara's list she wants
incorporated into the wedding.</i>

10:47.214 --> 10:48.246
Yep.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.547
There's six pages here.

10:49.616 --> 10:50.515
Yep.

10:50.584 --> 10:52.350
Who's wedding are we planning?

10:52.419 --> 10:55.253
And she supposedly
has a lead on a chef.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.321
But she doesn't wanna
tell me who.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.823
She wants to keep it
a surprise.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.859
Does she know how much
you love surprises?

11:00.927 --> 11:03.261
I don't think so.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.472
Here we are.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.844
It's so beautiful.

11:52.913 --> 11:53.945
Yeah.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.481
No wonder Abby and Tom
wanted it here.

11:59.653 --> 12:02.287
How long has it been
since you've been back?

12:02.355 --> 12:03.555
A couple years.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.890
I mean, we've been doing
so well

12:05.959 --> 12:07.992
and dad likes coming
to the city, you know?

12:08.061 --> 12:11.763
<i>So not much of a reason
for me to come back.</i>

12:11.832 --> 12:13.264
<i>Speaking of your dad,</i>

12:13.333 --> 12:14.666
<i>is he excited we're gonna
be staying with him?</i>

12:17.504 --> 12:18.737
You could say that.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.173
<i>Awe.</i>

12:22.242 --> 12:23.108
<i>Dad, let me help you
with that.</i>

12:23.176 --> 12:23.975
No, I got this.

12:24.811 --> 12:25.977
It's ok.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.513
There we go.

12:31.451 --> 12:35.086
So, honey, I thought you
could have your old room

12:35.155 --> 12:37.822
and we put Emma in the spare bed
in my office.

12:37.891 --> 12:41.259
I've cleared all my stuff out
so you guys can work in there.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.194
You're sure we're not
putting you out?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.696
No, no.

12:44.765 --> 12:45.997
Just 'cause you haven't been
here in a while, honey,

12:46.066 --> 12:48.767
doesn't mean that it's not
still your home.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.168
<i>Remember that.</i>

13:03.283 --> 13:07.519
So... you ready for this?

13:07.587 --> 13:08.987
I hope so.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.054
I think it's gonna take
a miracle

13:10.123 --> 13:11.790
to pull off this wedding.

13:11.858 --> 13:15.059
I meant are you ready to see
David again?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.495
Yeah, dad, I'll be fine.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.797
'Cause, you know,

13:18.865 --> 13:20.365
he asks about you every time
I see him in town.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.699
He does?

13:21.768 --> 13:22.934
Yeah, I saw him last week
at the grocery store.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.870
He asked how you were doing.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.405
What did you tell him?

13:27.474 --> 13:29.974
Well, I told him what I think
you would want me to tell him.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.976
That you're happy.

13:32.612 --> 13:33.011
Hey.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.345
Hey.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.113
Ready to go?

13:35.182 --> 13:35.847
Yeah.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.182
Hey, you just got here.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.050
I know, I just wanna go ahead
and go to the farm

13:39.119 --> 13:42.587
and get the whole meet and greet
thing with David out of the way.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.223
You know, do that before
everybody else gets here.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.959
How long since you've been
to the farm?

13:48.028 --> 13:49.794
I don't know, a long time.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.796
What, maybe since
high school?

13:51.865 --> 13:54.199
Yeah, but from what I can
remember it's very cute.

13:54.267 --> 13:57.402
It's got this rustic
kinda charm to it.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.920
Well, I see the rustic part.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.200
It's not as quiet as I thought
it would be.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.736
No.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.421
The house is cute.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.523
It's... shabby chic?

14:52.592 --> 14:54.559
Yeah, I'd say more shabby
than chic.

15:01.234 --> 15:01.966
Where are you going?

15:02.035 --> 15:02.700
I'm gonna go find David.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.502
Listen, do me a favour.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.138
Make a list of everything you
see that needs to be done here.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.076
That could take hours.

15:16.883 --> 15:17.682
David Nichols?

15:17.751 --> 15:19.484
Have you seen David Nichols?

15:23.757 --> 15:25.156
David?

15:29.029 --> 15:31.062
Excuse me, have you seen
David Nichols?

15:31.131 --> 15:32.764
Right over there.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.165
Thank you.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.554
Shut it down, guys.
Take five.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.859
Well, well, well.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.995
Look who decided
to come home.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.630
And look who never left.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.533
Yeah.

16:08.601 --> 16:09.968
It's good to see you,
city girl.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.869
You too, farm boy.

16:15.275 --> 16:18.142
Did you not get
the message I was coming?

16:18.211 --> 16:19.610
Yeah, I did.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.778
I'm sorry I couldn't come down
and meet you but,

16:20.847 --> 16:22.213
you know, our crew's
short right now,

16:22.282 --> 16:23.781
we just started fall harvest,
it's pretty crazy.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.784
Yeah, and we throw a big wedding
at you?

16:26.853 --> 16:27.819
Sorry about that.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.120
It's ok.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.756
Is it just me or is that
all happening pretty fast?

16:31.825 --> 16:33.891
No, it's happening fast.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.259
But it's two weeks.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.494
We'll be out of your hair
in no time.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.196
I promise.

16:38.264 --> 16:39.464
No worries.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.299
Sounds like we've both got
our hands full.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.801
Yeah, I guess so.

16:43.870 --> 16:44.702
Look, I gotta get back to work.

16:44.771 --> 16:45.937
It was really good to see you.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.005
Alright, let's go, boys.

16:47.073 --> 16:48.006
What-woah, woah, woah.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.407
Where are you going?

16:49.476 --> 16:50.942
Back to work?

16:51.011 --> 16:52.176
Yeah, but-hold on.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.012
We still have a lot of things
to go over.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.580
Feel free to do anything
you want on the farm.

16:55.648 --> 16:56.948
I just can't help you.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.816
I've only got five days
to harvest all this corn.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.251
Sorry.

17:13.933 --> 17:14.432
I got it.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.767
I got it.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.368
Listen, David, we've gotta
scout for a ceremony location

17:18.438 --> 17:19.337
tomorrow, ok?

17:19.406 --> 17:20.637
And-and this is your farm.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.373
I mean, I kinda need you
there to tell me

17:22.442 --> 17:24.342
if we're gonna run
into any problems.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.877
Sarah, I really wish
that I could.

17:25.944 --> 17:26.978
I am slammed right now,

17:27.047 --> 17:29.313
so have Tom help you out.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.983
Tom's working to clear some
time for a quick honeymoon

17:32.052 --> 17:33.718
before he leaves on tour.

17:33.787 --> 17:35.386
He's not gonna be here
until next week.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.289
Alright, well,
you know the farm.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.624
Show yourself around.

17:41.528 --> 17:45.296
Well, can we at least talk
about fixing up the farm house?

17:45.365 --> 17:46.831
What do you mean?

17:46.900 --> 17:50.468
Like, when's the last time
you cleaned up around here?

17:50.537 --> 17:53.037
How do you clean up a farm?

17:53.106 --> 17:54.906
David, has anybody told you

17:54.974 --> 17:57.975
that this is gonna be
a high-profile wedding?

17:58.044 --> 17:59.177
No, actually.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.578
Tom told me it was gonna be
very simple.

18:01.848 --> 18:02.880
Yeah, there's nothing simple

18:02.949 --> 18:06.184
about planning a wedding
in two weeks.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.785
Alright, so let me get
this straight.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.720
You want me to fix up
the farm house,

18:09.789 --> 18:11.122
clean the farm,

18:11.191 --> 18:12.824
all while I'm in the middle
of the fall harvest?

18:12.892 --> 18:14.492
Mmmhmm.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.094
I'm happy to do it myself but
I'm just here to let you know

18:16.162 --> 18:18.429
that there are gonna be
some changes made around here.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.165
Hold on.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.368
Hello?

18:24.437 --> 18:25.069
What?

18:25.138 --> 18:25.870
Hello?

18:25.939 --> 18:27.438
Emma, I can't hear you.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.040
Just speak up a little bit.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.708
Hold on.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.045
Shut her down!

18:34.114 --> 18:35.012
<i>You got it.</i>

18:37.016 --> 18:38.516
Thank you.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.152
Hey.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.487
What?!

18:42.555 --> 18:43.654
What do you mean Peyton Ellis

18:43.723 --> 18:47.024
from Wedding Insider
magazine is here?

18:47.093 --> 18:49.293
Ok, I'll be right there.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.530
Thank you.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.242
Sarah.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.510
What happened to you?

19:05.578 --> 19:06.611
I was talking to David.

19:06.679 --> 19:07.512
I told him there were
gonna be

19:07.580 --> 19:09.347
some changes made around here.

19:09.415 --> 19:10.681
And you guys wrestled
about it?

19:10.750 --> 19:11.682
What? No.

19:11.751 --> 19:12.884
Stop! No.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.719
I just-I hiked through
a field, ok?

19:14.787 --> 19:16.187
There was corn and-what?

19:16.256 --> 19:17.522
Nothing.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.757
I just never pictured you
as a farm girl is all.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.592
I'm not a farm girl.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.194
Ok?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.262
Here he comes.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.196
How do I look?

19:25.265 --> 19:25.796
Like you've been wrestling.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.431
Fix me.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.634
Didn't I just see you yesterday?

19:29.702 --> 19:31.536
Hi.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.304
You know my associate, Emma?

19:33.373 --> 19:34.805
Yeah, hi, how's it going?

19:34.874 --> 19:35.940
Yeah.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.209
I was not expecting you.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.844
Kind of a big surprise.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.079
Well, when I heard the news
that my new friend Sarah Bloom

19:42.148 --> 19:43.481
was heading back home to plan

19:43.550 --> 19:46.817
none other than Abby King's
wedding in two weeks...

19:46.886 --> 19:50.688
My editors and I agreed
this just might be your shot

19:50.757 --> 19:54.125
at the featured article,
or even...

19:54.194 --> 19:55.626
You're getting a cover story?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.128
No.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.196
I mean, he can't promise
anything but yeah, there's...

19:58.264 --> 19:59.564
there's a possibility.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.500
I just wish it
wasn't this wedding.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.801
Why not?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.170
Because, dad, I have, like,
two weeks to plan

20:06.239 --> 20:08.406
the biggest wedding
of my entire life.

20:08.474 --> 20:11.242
Honey, you'll be great.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.110
I guess I really don't have
much of a choice now, do I?

20:13.179 --> 20:14.545
You know?

20:14.614 --> 20:16.781
I pass up the opportunity
I may not get another shot.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.382
But if it's not perfect
I could end up

20:18.451 --> 20:23.087
in the 'what went wrong' section
and just ruin my entire career.

20:23.156 --> 20:25.323
I think this is wonderful news.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.991
It's the game changer.

20:28.628 --> 20:29.927
I need some air.

20:48.615 --> 20:49.380
<i>Hotel rooms.</i>

20:49.449 --> 20:50.181
<i>Hotel rooms.</i>

20:50.250 --> 20:51.449
<i>Lots of hotel rooms.</i>

20:51.517 --> 20:52.817
Flowers.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.852
Barbara loves flowers.

20:54.921 --> 20:55.720
Ok.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.321
Transportation.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.090
Limos versus buses.

20:59.158 --> 20:59.957
Buses.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.759
Does anybody like buses anymore?

21:01.828 --> 21:02.493
I don't know.

21:02.562 --> 21:03.761
Maybe updated buses.

21:03.830 --> 21:04.695
Like, nice buses.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.764
Hotel rooms.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.132
Hotel rooms.

21:08.201 --> 21:10.701
Wait a minute, did I just...
just say hotel rooms?

21:14.607 --> 21:15.539
Hey.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.707
Well, well, well.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.009
Look who it is.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.043
What, are you stalking me?

21:20.146 --> 21:23.180
No. I'm not stalking you.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.116
I just came out to get
some air.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.484
What are you doing?

21:26.552 --> 21:27.985
I just had a little meeting
with the town council.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.353
We got our farmer's market
coming up.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.622
I'm one of the founders, so,
you know...

21:31.691 --> 21:33.291
Look at you.

21:33.359 --> 21:34.425
Yeah, fancy?

21:34.494 --> 21:35.893
Yeah.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.461
You should definitely come
by though, it's... it's great.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.429
It's really something.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.697
You know, I'd love to,

21:39.766 --> 21:41.565
I'm just-I'm kinda crazed
right now.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.933
Yeah, I kinda got that idea
when you took off

21:43.002 --> 21:44.568
on the phone this morning.

21:44.637 --> 21:45.603
You ok?

21:45.672 --> 21:46.103
Yeah.

21:46.172 --> 21:47.371
Yeah.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.639
It's just this reporter
from this great magazine

21:48.708 --> 21:50.975
wants to do a feature
on the wedding, so...

21:51.044 --> 21:52.710
That's-that's great
though, right?

21:52.779 --> 21:54.011
Yeah, no, it's great.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.680
It's just that the stakes
for the wedding

21:55.748 --> 21:57.615
just went through the roof
and if I don't get it perfect

21:57.684 --> 22:00.017
then it could ruin everything
I've worked for but no,

22:00.086 --> 22:02.119
it's wonderful.

22:03.189 --> 22:04.322
I mean, I'm not worried
about it

22:04.390 --> 22:05.956
'cause the Sarah Bloom
that I remember,

22:06.025 --> 22:06.957
she'd always find a way
to get it done

22:07.026 --> 22:08.025
no matter what
the challenge.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.560
So I think you're good.

22:09.629 --> 22:12.063
Hopefully I haven't changed
that much.

22:12.131 --> 22:12.697
Yeah.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.098
I have faith.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.900
By the way, I've got
some great news.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.401
I found this landscaper
buddy of mine,

22:17.470 --> 22:18.803
he's gonna come over
and do some work.

22:18.871 --> 22:19.770
Great.

22:19.839 --> 22:20.571
Is he good?

22:20.640 --> 22:21.972
Yeah, he's good enough.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.675
He's just planting some flowers
around the house, right?

22:24.744 --> 22:27.178
Yeah, it might be a little
more than planting some flowers

22:27.246 --> 22:28.646
around the house.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.581
Do you mind if I meet him?

22:30.650 --> 22:32.650
Yeah, if that's what you
want, I can set something up.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.552
Thank you.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.053
Do you want a lift?

22:36.122 --> 22:38.622
No.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.459
No, I'm just kinda
getting reacquainted.

22:41.527 --> 22:42.526
Alright.

22:42.595 --> 22:43.327
If you change your mind
let me know.

22:43.396 --> 22:44.128
I'll be your tour guide.

22:44.197 --> 22:45.229
I'll keep that in mind.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.299
Still the same
old truck?

22:48.368 --> 22:49.800
If something ain't broke,
don't fix it.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.166
Hey there.

23:22.235 --> 23:22.767
Good morning.

23:22.835 --> 23:23.367
Can I help you?

23:23.436 --> 23:24.602
Hi.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.337
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

23:26.406 --> 23:27.738
I hope I didn't
wake you.

23:27.807 --> 23:28.606
No, no, no.

23:28.674 --> 23:29.473
The rooster did that hours ago.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.741
Just taking a little break.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.109
You must be David.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.010
I'm Peyton Ellis.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.145
From Wedding Insider magazine.

23:34.213 --> 23:35.279
Yeah, you're the reporter

23:35.348 --> 23:37.214
that Sarah was talking
about yesterday.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.315
Great.

23:38.384 --> 23:40.718
Sorry about that.
Farm hands.

23:40.787 --> 23:41.318
Hey, it's fine.

23:41.387 --> 23:42.920
No worries.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.789
Yes, I'm the I'm the
reporter and I gotta say

23:44.857 --> 23:46.424
I'm pretty excited to be here.

23:46.492 --> 23:49.126
I can't wait to see how Sarah's
gonna transform this place.

23:50.730 --> 23:51.328
Yeah, yeah.

23:51.397 --> 23:52.797
Super exciting.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.165
Look, we're in the middle of
fall harvest right now

23:54.233 --> 23:56.700
so hopefully you can make room
for both of us?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.235
Fall harvest, really?

23:58.304 --> 24:01.906
So I guess we can call this a,
harvest wedding then?

24:01.974 --> 24:02.973
Sure.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.177
Hi.

24:06.245 --> 24:07.077
Hey there.

24:09.048 --> 24:09.547
That's interesting.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.081
Mmmhmm.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.583
So I see you two have met.

24:12.652 --> 24:13.918
Sure did.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.252
David here was just informing
me about the,

24:15.321 --> 24:17.054
big harvest going on now.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.589
Ok.

24:18.658 --> 24:19.590
And Peyton was telling me
how much he's looking forward

24:19.659 --> 24:21.525
to you changing the place.

24:23.095 --> 24:23.894
Oooh.

24:26.432 --> 24:26.997
Here we go.

24:27.066 --> 24:27.898
Mmmhmm.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.936
<i>She doesn't look happy.</i>

24:32.004 --> 24:33.737
No.

24:33.806 --> 24:34.872
I'll be right back.

24:34.941 --> 24:35.406
Yeah.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.810
Hello, Barbara.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.345
I know what you're thinking.

24:41.414 --> 24:42.780
I really don't think you do.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.849
Look, I promise you
I can fix all of this.

24:44.917 --> 24:45.883
It'll be beautiful.

24:45.952 --> 24:46.750
Don't worry, mom.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.552
I have full faith in Sarah.

24:50.423 --> 24:51.789
Barbara, I believe
you spoke to Peyton

24:51.858 --> 24:53.090
on the phone yesterday.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.158
Yes.

24:54.227 --> 24:55.059
Thank you so much
for coming up.

24:55.127 --> 24:56.026
Hi, David.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.261
Thank you for
the invitation.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.063
Can't wait to share
in the adventure.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.232
Welcome, everybody.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.300
Welcome to the farm.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.071
We have a big day
ahead of us.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.673
But first of all I just wanted
to say thank you.

25:09.742 --> 25:12.676
I'm really honoured
and I'm very excited

25:12.745 --> 25:14.044
to be planning this wedding.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.113
To be back home again,
it's-it's great,

25:16.182 --> 25:17.815
so it really means a lot
to me.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.550
We have a lot to do.

25:19.619 --> 25:22.253
Not a lot of time to do it,

25:22.321 --> 25:24.889
but it doesn't mean we can't
have a little fun, right?

25:24.957 --> 25:28.592
Not a lot of fun, Barbara,
just-just a little.

25:28.661 --> 25:29.727
First things first.

25:29.795 --> 25:31.362
I wanna talk about
ceremony location.

25:31.430 --> 25:32.730
Most important thing.

25:32.798 --> 25:35.332
It's kinda like the foundation
of a wedding.

25:35.401 --> 25:36.400
Ok.

25:36.469 --> 25:37.501
Emma and I have been
scouting around,

25:37.570 --> 25:40.037
we have some great ideas
for everybody,

25:40.106 --> 25:42.006
so if you could just
follow me.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.841
Great.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.276
What're you doing?

25:45.344 --> 25:47.778
You said you needed some
help so I found some time.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.146
Thank you.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.651
Excuse me.

25:53.719 --> 25:54.752
I'm stuck!

25:54.820 --> 25:55.953
Can I get a little help
here, please?

25:56.022 --> 25:58.055
I'm so sorry.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.657
Just pop those
right out of there.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.326
Looks like you're sticking
around, Barbara.

26:02.395 --> 26:04.361
So it's a little bit of a walk

26:04.430 --> 26:07.631
but when you see it it's gonna
take your breath away.

26:07.700 --> 26:08.399
Hey, Sarah?

26:08.467 --> 26:09.133
Yeah?

26:09.201 --> 26:10.234
Where are we going?

26:10.303 --> 26:12.136
The little clearing
by the stream.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.071
Yeah.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.907
It is the most beautiful
spot in the entire farm.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.809
It's definitely pretty but...

26:18.878 --> 26:20.611
And, you know what?
Barbara?

26:20.680 --> 26:24.081
There's this little pathway
that leads to the water.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.950
You know what I'm gonna do
with it?

26:26.018 --> 26:28.819
I'm gonna blanket it
with white roses.

26:28.888 --> 26:29.520
Ok.

26:29.589 --> 26:30.721
And the ceremony?

26:30.790 --> 26:32.623
The ceremony is gonna be
right by the stream

26:32.692 --> 26:37.227
with a backdrop of the mountains
and the sun will be setting.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.597
I wouldn't do it there.

26:39.665 --> 26:40.798
What're you talking about?

26:40.866 --> 26:42.333
You know how the weather
changes around here.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.735
One minute the rain,
it'll flood out the wedding.

26:45.871 --> 26:47.571
Yeah. Yeah, he's right.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.640
Do you remember when we were
in high school?

26:49.709 --> 26:52.710
We used to go tubing down
that stream all the time.

26:52.778 --> 26:53.377
That was the best.

26:53.446 --> 26:54.144
It was.

26:54.213 --> 26:54.878
I loved those summers.

26:54.947 --> 26:55.746
We could still do that.

26:55.815 --> 26:56.213
What?

26:56.282 --> 26:56.981
Really?

26:57.717 --> 26:58.983
Excuse me.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.885
Alright, ok, what about
the clearing on the north side?

27:02.755 --> 27:03.988
That's a good idea

27:04.056 --> 27:05.255
except there's cabbage
and carrots there.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.557
That's up to harvest.

27:06.626 --> 27:09.293
What about the corral
down by the old stable?

27:09.362 --> 27:10.127
Yeah.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.562
That's good, too.

27:11.631 --> 27:14.398
Except I have eggplant and
corn there, also up for harvest.

27:14.467 --> 27:15.633
The supply bar.

27:15.701 --> 27:16.834
That cute little cluster
of trees right there?

27:16.902 --> 27:18.268
Yeah, there's no trees
there anymore,

27:18.337 --> 27:20.771
it's just cauliflower
and broccoli which is also...

27:20.840 --> 27:23.073
Up for harvest.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.108
What can I say, folks?

27:24.176 --> 27:25.075
It's that time of year.

27:26.879 --> 27:29.513
You know, would
you just excuse us

27:29.582 --> 27:31.448
just for one second, please?

27:33.719 --> 27:35.185
Great.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.887
What do you think?

27:36.956 --> 27:38.222
About?

27:38.290 --> 27:39.657
About where we're gonna have
this wedding.

27:39.725 --> 27:41.592
I heard churches
are great.

27:41.661 --> 27:42.860
Come on, David, stop.

27:42.928 --> 27:44.228
Look, I don't know what
you want me to say.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.029
I don't know wedding spots.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.563
I'm a farmer on a farm.

27:46.632 --> 27:48.399
Use your imagination.

27:48.467 --> 27:51.301
Where's a place that, when
you see it and you're there,

27:51.370 --> 27:54.371
it just-it feels special?

27:54.440 --> 27:57.541
Yeah, I know one place.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.544
Ok.

28:06.519 --> 28:08.752
Will it work?

28:12.725 --> 28:14.358
Yeah.

28:14.427 --> 28:18.328
Well, it's... it's close
to the entrance and...

28:18.397 --> 28:20.397
and the house,

28:20.466 --> 28:22.533
and it's on level ground.

28:22.601 --> 28:24.635
I see a lot of potential.

28:25.771 --> 28:28.672
Barbara? What do you think?

28:28.741 --> 28:30.207
I'm not so sure.

28:31.744 --> 28:35.612
I'm just having trouble
picturing it, that's all.

28:35.681 --> 28:37.381
Let me see what I can do.

28:46.525 --> 28:49.126
We'll begin in
the late afternoon

28:49.195 --> 28:53.030
when the light is
absolutely flawless

28:53.099 --> 28:55.566
and there's a soft autumn glow.

28:57.503 --> 29:00.904
White roses with touches of
lace line the main drive

29:00.973 --> 29:03.841
as our guests make their way
through the farm.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.343
And when they pull up
to the house which,

29:06.412 --> 29:10.047
by the way, will be
magazine-ready, they will see

29:10.116 --> 29:13.984
that the landscaping and
the grounds are flawless.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.753
They are pristine.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.356
And then they will be ushered
to a welcoming area,

29:19.425 --> 29:23.393
and there will be music
and wine and champagne

29:23.462 --> 29:25.696
and people will be
laughing and smiling

29:25.765 --> 29:28.499
and talking about how much
they can't wait

29:28.567 --> 29:31.135
to see the bride and groom.

29:31.203 --> 29:34.338
And when it's time,
everyone will make their way

29:34.406 --> 29:38.876
down a path of white roses
to the tree,

29:38.944 --> 29:42.379
which will be draped
with soft white silk,

29:42.448 --> 29:45.749
gently blowing in the breeze.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.351
There will be an aisle,

29:47.419 --> 29:50.721
it will be split with
crisp white chairs

29:50.790 --> 29:54.224
and that is where everyone
will sit when they witness

29:54.293 --> 30:00.364
Tom and Abby
say those words 'I do'.

30:00.432 --> 30:07.070
And it will be emotional
and breathtaking,

30:07.139 --> 30:11.341
and will remind everyone
there of why they aspire

30:11.410 --> 30:14.845
to fall in love
in the first place.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.351
Can you really do all of that?

30:21.420 --> 30:23.187
Mmmhmm.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.088
I can't wait to see it.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.257
That was definitely something.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.673
Hey, you coming?

30:44.910 --> 30:46.877
I'll catch up with you guys.

30:46.946 --> 30:49.179
I got a little work
I gotta get done.

30:49.248 --> 30:50.848
Ok.

31:28.754 --> 31:30.153
And tomorrow Tony says

31:30.256 --> 31:32.189
he'll have all the dresses here
by 3:00.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.557
Good. Yes.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.492
Check that box.

31:36.795 --> 31:39.396
Do we have the schedule
for the load-in?

31:39.465 --> 31:42.199
Yeah, I got that right here.

31:42.268 --> 31:43.567
Here you go.

31:43.636 --> 31:44.935
Thank you.

31:46.205 --> 31:49.039
Is that you and your mom?

31:49.108 --> 31:50.107
Yeah.

31:50.175 --> 31:51.909
It was at a wedding
she planned.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.076
I didn't know she was
a planner.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.211
I didn't tell you that?

31:54.280 --> 31:54.711
No.

31:54.780 --> 31:55.946
Yeah.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.482
Well, she did it kinda like a...
more as a hobby.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.317
But she was good at it.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.719
She's my inspiration.

32:02.788 --> 32:05.455
I remember she always
used to tell me

32:05.524 --> 32:06.857
the best wedding planners

32:06.926 --> 32:09.359
find out what a person's
dream is

32:09.428 --> 32:12.529
and makes it come true.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.197
She sounds awesome.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.866
She was.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.536
Wait a minute.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.972
I gotta meet David and
his friend about the house.

32:24.677 --> 32:25.609
I'll be back in a little bit.

32:25.678 --> 32:26.944
Mmmhmm.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.281
I don't know, maybe I should
just hire a crew.

32:31.350 --> 32:32.049
No, no, no.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.250
Look, you were right,

32:33.319 --> 32:35.619
the house should be fixed up
for the wedding.

32:35.688 --> 32:37.154
I wanna do this
for Tom and Abby.

32:37.222 --> 32:38.722
What about the harvest?

32:38.791 --> 32:39.656
We'll make it work.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.124
It's only a couple of days.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.527
Besides, Flemming here is a
cracker jack landscaper, right?

32:43.595 --> 32:45.529
Well, I cut mostly lawns.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.698
No, no, he does gardens too.

32:47.766 --> 32:48.865
Yeah, sure.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.233
When they tell me
what to do.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.005
Don't worry, alright?

32:55.074 --> 32:57.307
It's all gonna work out.

32:57.376 --> 32:58.041
Alright.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.944
Flemming, see you
at the house tomorrow,

33:01.013 --> 33:02.579
I'll tell you exactly what
needs to be done, ok?

33:02.648 --> 33:04.681
Sure. I'll walk you out.

33:06.719 --> 33:08.151
There's Peyton.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.486
I'll be right back.

33:11.056 --> 33:13.056
<i>Nice to see you.</i>

33:13.125 --> 33:14.491
Good. How are you?

33:15.461 --> 33:17.227
Who's that?

33:17.296 --> 33:20.063
He's this reporter for
a magazine that wants

33:20.132 --> 33:22.065
to do a story on Sarah
and the wedding.

33:22.134 --> 33:25.002
I guess they must really
like her then?

33:29.708 --> 33:31.375
I can't wait for you to see
the market tomorrow.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.076
Yeah.

33:33.145 --> 33:35.846
Well, like I said, I'm gonna try
to stop by but I'm kinda busy.

33:35.914 --> 33:38.148
Well, you know, if you can.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.549
Let me ask you.

33:39.618 --> 33:40.917
What's the deal with Peyton?

33:40.986 --> 33:42.719
What do you mean?

33:42.788 --> 33:45.188
Well, do you think he's gonna
write a good article about you?

33:45.257 --> 33:46.690
Well, I hope so.

33:46.759 --> 33:49.459
I mean, that magazine is known
for not pulling any punches.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.162
I mean, not that I'd want
them to anyway, ok?

33:52.231 --> 33:55.699
But I'm just saying, you know,
this one, it's all on me.

33:58.470 --> 34:01.671
Hey, can I ask you something?

34:01.740 --> 34:03.840
Sure.

34:03.909 --> 34:06.476
Are you ok with where
the ceremony location is?

34:06.545 --> 34:08.411
What, at the tree?

34:08.480 --> 34:09.012
Yeah.

34:09.081 --> 34:10.213
I suggested it.

34:10.282 --> 34:11.748
I know.

34:11.817 --> 34:15.052
I know, I'm just wondering if,
you know, you remembered.

34:15.120 --> 34:18.121
Remembered... that you kissed
me there?

34:18.190 --> 34:19.589
You kissed me.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.458
No way.

34:21.527 --> 34:22.492
Definitely the other
way around.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.529
No, I'm serious.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.264
Are you ok with it?

34:29.501 --> 34:31.268
Yeah.

34:31.335 --> 34:33.437
The way I see it, it's always
been a good spot.

34:35.107 --> 34:37.139
Yeah.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.309
Alright, well I'll
see you tomorrow?

34:39.378 --> 34:40.577
Yeah.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.266
Come on.

35:14.379 --> 35:15.846
Well, here we are.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.618
I feel so stupid.

35:21.687 --> 35:22.919
So what.

35:22.988 --> 35:24.187
You hit the curb and blew
out a couple tires.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.722
Everybody does it.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.090
Yeah, have you?

35:27.159 --> 35:30.694
Like, you know,
three times last week.

35:30.762 --> 35:31.528
It was an accident.

35:31.597 --> 35:32.262
It's all good.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.665
No, I actually
wasn't paying attention.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.367
Yeah, I see that.

35:37.436 --> 35:40.604
What were you thinking about?

35:40.672 --> 35:41.805
Just...

35:41.874 --> 35:44.708
I got a lot on my mind.

35:44.776 --> 35:45.408
Thank you.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.943
Yeah, you got it.

35:49.581 --> 35:50.780
Yeah. It does
that sometimes.

35:50.849 --> 35:51.982
Let me help you.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.550
You hadn't got this fixed yet?

35:53.619 --> 35:55.152
All this time?

35:55.220 --> 35:56.286
I got a farm to run.

35:56.355 --> 35:57.988
I don't have time
to fix a door.

36:06.398 --> 36:06.897
There.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.266
Thank you.

36:09.334 --> 36:12.068
Well...

36:24.149 --> 36:25.282
Where have you been?

36:25.350 --> 36:26.850
I just-I got in a little
car accident.

36:26.919 --> 36:28.018
My gosh, are you ok?

36:28.086 --> 36:28.652
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.953
I'm fine.

36:30.022 --> 36:31.922
It's just-I blew out
my two front tires.

36:31.990 --> 36:32.856
It's embarrassing.

36:32.925 --> 36:34.491
I don't wanna talk about it.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.625
Ok.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.460
I got a message
and it's a big one.

36:38.764 --> 36:39.696
You know who the chef is?

36:39.765 --> 36:40.931
Mmmhmm.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.299
Who is it?

36:42.367 --> 36:44.401
Does Collin Shaw
ring a bell?

36:44.469 --> 36:45.368
Come on.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.504
Mmmhmm.

36:47.573 --> 36:48.505
Are you serious?

36:48.574 --> 36:49.573
Yes.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.875
Three Michelin stars
Collin Shaw?

36:51.944 --> 36:53.777
Like, I don't think he's ever
done a wedding before

36:53.845 --> 36:55.645
in his entire career
Collin Shaw?

36:56.949 --> 36:58.081
This is huge!

36:58.150 --> 36:59.482
Do you understand?

36:59.551 --> 37:02.018
We are no longer planning
the wedding of the season.

37:02.087 --> 37:05.021
We are planning the wedding
of the century!

37:05.090 --> 37:05.889
Yes!

37:05.958 --> 37:06.890
Oooh.

37:14.132 --> 37:14.864
There she is.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.366
Barbara!

37:16.435 --> 37:18.101
Collin Shaw?

37:18.170 --> 37:19.636
How'd you do that?

37:19.705 --> 37:21.538
We hosted a thing together
in the city

37:21.607 --> 37:23.240
and let's just say he owed me.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.876
Well, now I owe you.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.979
Abby and I are off
to a nail appointment

37:29.047 --> 37:33.416
but so you know I just
sent you a revised list

37:33.485 --> 37:35.819
for some changes I'd like
for the reception.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.053
Make sure you look at that.

37:37.122 --> 37:38.288
Sure. No problem.

37:40.492 --> 37:41.858
Excuse me for a second.

37:41.927 --> 37:42.792
Of course.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.361
<i>Barbara King, that's right.</i>

37:44.429 --> 37:48.665
Girly, you have Collin Shaw
cooking for your wedding!

37:48.734 --> 37:49.733
Yeah, I know.

37:49.801 --> 37:54.304
It's, it's gonna
be great.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.805
Are you ok?

37:55.874 --> 37:58.775
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

37:58.844 --> 38:01.911
I... I just keep thinking
about my mother's new list.

38:03.048 --> 38:03.947
I mean, don't get me wrong.

38:04.016 --> 38:06.416
My mother has
impeccable taste

38:06.485 --> 38:08.952
but everything's getting
so much bigger

38:09.021 --> 38:11.621
than I imagined it would be,
you know?

38:11.690 --> 38:13.056
Abby?

38:13.125 --> 38:13.857
Are you coming?

38:13.925 --> 38:15.125
I don't want to be late.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.295
You guys have fun.

38:45.424 --> 38:46.656
Flemming.

38:46.725 --> 38:48.124
Where are you?

39:00.472 --> 39:01.504
I knew it.

39:04.543 --> 39:05.408
You're gonna love these.

39:05.477 --> 39:06.242
Delicious.

39:06.311 --> 39:07.644
Have a great day. Thanks.

39:08.747 --> 39:09.479
David.

39:09.548 --> 39:10.313
Hey.

39:10.382 --> 39:11.114
Flemming's a no-show.

39:11.183 --> 39:12.215
Just the two of those?

39:12.284 --> 39:13.383
I went to the house,
he's not there,

39:13.452 --> 39:15.885
I tried to call,
he won't answer.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.655
Alright, alright,
I'll talk to him.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.123
<i>What's fresh today?</i>

39:20.192 --> 39:21.524
These ones right here
we just picked earlier today.

39:21.593 --> 39:22.959
Literally this morning.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.161
What about the tractor
I asked you to move?

39:25.230 --> 39:26.496
What about it?

39:26.565 --> 39:27.731
It's still there.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.065
These ones are the ripe ones,
right here.

39:29.134 --> 39:30.066
I'll move it.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.901
As soon as I get it running.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.503
What?

39:33.572 --> 39:34.738
Just because
it's not running now

39:34.806 --> 39:36.439
doesn't mean I can't
get it running.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.341
Please.

39:38.410 --> 39:39.275
Alright, look.

39:39.344 --> 39:40.577
I'll make you a little bet.

39:40.645 --> 39:42.112
If I can get it running
you gotta cook me dinner.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.147
If I can't get it running

39:44.216 --> 39:46.216
then I've gotta take you
some place fancy.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.218
You are driving me crazy.

39:48.286 --> 39:50.553
Not as crazy as this
is gonna make you.

39:50.622 --> 39:51.955
Try that.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.022
It's a tomato.

39:53.091 --> 39:55.859
It is a Nichols family farm
tomato.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.026
Give it a try.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.428
I've had one of
your tomatoes before.

39:58.497 --> 40:00.230
You haven't tried them
since I've taken over.

40:00.298 --> 40:02.065
Go on, try it.

40:02.134 --> 40:03.066
Ok, stop.

40:11.543 --> 40:14.043
Told you.

40:14.112 --> 40:15.545
This is good.

40:15.614 --> 40:16.913
I'm sorry, that's what?

40:16.982 --> 40:17.680
It's good.

40:17.749 --> 40:18.515
It's good, right?

40:18.583 --> 40:19.983
It's really good.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.050
I know.

40:21.119 --> 40:21.985
You know what?

40:22.053 --> 40:23.019
Let's go for a little walk.

40:23.088 --> 40:23.686
Can you take over for me
for a sec?

40:23.755 --> 40:24.721
<i>Sure thing.</i>

40:24.790 --> 40:26.055
<i>Come with me.</i>

40:32.063 --> 40:34.063
Tobin White, how're you doing,
buddy?

40:34.132 --> 40:34.964
Hey!

40:35.033 --> 40:36.232
This is my good friend, Sarah.

40:36.301 --> 40:38.568
Tobin here is the best butcher
in the state.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.403
He's a flatterer.

40:40.472 --> 40:41.271
But he ain't lying.

40:42.207 --> 40:43.606
Here, try a piece.

40:44.976 --> 40:45.909
Ok.

40:51.149 --> 40:52.682
So good.

40:52.751 --> 40:53.316
It's not over.

40:53.385 --> 40:53.950
Thanks, Tobin.

40:54.019 --> 40:54.818
See you soon.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.085
Really good.

40:56.154 --> 40:58.421
Ms. MacDonald, my
favourite person.

40:58.490 --> 40:59.889
Look at this.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.291
Hello.

41:01.359 --> 41:02.525
What you got for me?

41:03.795 --> 41:05.562
A lemon pie.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.297
You read my mind.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.837
How do you do that?

41:13.905 --> 41:15.672
A lady never tells her secrets.

41:15.740 --> 41:16.372
That's right.

41:18.777 --> 41:19.809
Thank you.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.550
This whole farm
to table movement

41:27.619 --> 41:29.586
has changed everything
for a local farmer.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.054
It's like bringing everybody
back home.

41:31.122 --> 41:35.124
You get better food, better
health, just a better community.

41:35.193 --> 41:37.527
You sound like you're
on a crusade.

41:37.596 --> 41:38.194
I am.

41:38.263 --> 41:38.795
Oooh.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.665
Hey, Stevie,
how're you doing?

41:42.734 --> 41:43.500
<i>Pretty good.</i>

41:43.568 --> 41:45.335
Good.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.804
Everybody really loves you
around here, don't they?

41:47.873 --> 41:49.639
What's not to love?

41:49.708 --> 41:51.608
Well, if that's the case,
mister,

41:51.676 --> 41:53.510
why haven't you
ever been married?

41:53.578 --> 41:55.678
What makes you think
I haven't been?

41:55.747 --> 41:58.114
Because I've seen the inside
of your house.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.516
Good point.

41:59.584 --> 42:03.653
I came close, but it's
like my mom always says,

42:03.722 --> 42:04.954
it's hard to get married
to someone

42:05.023 --> 42:07.323
when you're already married
to your work.

42:08.593 --> 42:09.492
What?

42:10.529 --> 42:11.694
What?

42:12.764 --> 42:13.830
That's what Emma says
to me.

42:13.899 --> 42:15.532
Those exact words.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.199
Really?

42:16.268 --> 42:17.400
Yeah.

42:17.469 --> 42:18.668
Maybe we still have
something in common.

42:22.841 --> 42:24.307
You have something right here.

42:24.376 --> 42:25.475
Something where?

42:25.544 --> 42:26.743
Right there.

42:26.845 --> 42:27.443
Right here?

42:27.512 --> 42:28.578
No, right on your...

42:28.647 --> 42:29.245
Where?

42:31.383 --> 42:32.715
Here.

42:32.784 --> 42:34.617
There, now it's gone.

42:34.686 --> 42:35.919
Ok, look.

42:35.987 --> 42:37.186
I gotta get going but
I'm gonna give you this

42:37.255 --> 42:38.988
so you can stay dry and
I'll talk to you later.

42:39.057 --> 42:39.889
Are you sure?

42:39.958 --> 42:41.357
I'm a farm boy.

42:41.426 --> 42:42.692
Bye.

42:59.878 --> 43:01.010
Ok, thank you.

43:01.079 --> 43:01.911
Hey, lady.

43:02.447 --> 43:03.646
Hey.

43:03.715 --> 43:04.948
What're you doing here?

43:05.016 --> 43:07.317
I just had to speak to David
about something.

43:07.385 --> 43:11.220
Just walking around,
checking things out.

43:11.289 --> 43:12.188
Where's your mom?

43:12.257 --> 43:13.990
Back at the hotel.

43:14.059 --> 43:16.359
This is definitely
not her vibe.

43:16.428 --> 43:17.994
Yeah, I wouldn't think so.

43:19.764 --> 43:20.563
I'm the opposite.

43:20.632 --> 43:23.499
I feel totally at home here.

43:23.568 --> 43:24.434
Really?

43:24.502 --> 43:25.234
Yeah.

43:25.303 --> 43:26.336
I love farmer's markets.

43:26.404 --> 43:27.904
I always have.

43:27.973 --> 43:30.540
There's something so nice
about the whole community

43:30.609 --> 43:31.874
coming together to share

43:31.943 --> 43:34.577
what they're really
passionate about.

43:34.646 --> 43:38.081
I don't know, it just feels
really special to me.

43:40.352 --> 43:42.051
Sarah?

43:42.120 --> 43:44.153
Are you ok?

43:44.222 --> 43:48.358
Yeah, I just...

43:48.426 --> 43:51.928
Abby, I just realized I've been
planning the wrong wedding.

44:11.616 --> 44:12.548
<i>Thank you, guys.</i>

44:12.617 --> 44:13.516
<i>Appreciate that.</i>

44:15.687 --> 44:17.286
Hi. I need to talk to you.

44:17.355 --> 44:18.021
Yeah? Sure.

44:18.089 --> 44:19.322
Yeah.

44:19.391 --> 44:20.523
I'm kinda slammed right now
though, but...

44:20.592 --> 44:22.792
I know, but I want to move
the reception.

44:22.861 --> 44:23.860
Yeah? Where?

44:23.928 --> 44:25.795
In here.

44:25.864 --> 44:27.163
If you haven't noticed

44:27.232 --> 44:28.665
I'm kinda using this space
right now.

44:28.733 --> 44:31.034
Well, I mean,
not in here, up there.

44:31.102 --> 44:32.268
Using that also, so...

44:32.337 --> 44:34.037
I know, it's a big ask but...

44:34.105 --> 44:36.139
Sarah, I really wish I could
but I can't, ok?

44:36.207 --> 44:38.641
I wanna bring this wedding
back to the farm.

44:38.710 --> 44:41.177
Make it more about
what Tom and Abby wanted

44:41.246 --> 44:43.513
from the very beginning,
which is...

44:43.581 --> 44:44.781
Simple?

44:48.019 --> 44:49.752
Can you hand that
to me please?

44:49.821 --> 44:51.287
Look, all I'm saying...

44:51.389 --> 44:51.988
No, not that.

44:52.057 --> 44:53.823
The the book.

44:53.892 --> 44:55.792
Thank you.

44:55.860 --> 44:56.893
What's this?

44:56.961 --> 44:57.794
That's nothing.

44:57.862 --> 44:59.429
It looks like something.

44:59.497 --> 45:01.597
It's just a little experiment
that I've been working on.

45:01.666 --> 45:04.534
What are you, like a mad
scientist now?

45:04.602 --> 45:06.335
Only on nights and weekends.

45:06.404 --> 45:08.137
Look, I wish I could help you
but I can't just pick up

45:08.206 --> 45:10.039
the entire operation
and move it.

45:10.108 --> 45:11.240
I know it sounds crazy
but you...

45:11.309 --> 45:13.509
you just gotta trust me
on this one.

45:13.578 --> 45:15.678
What about this massive tent
that you have coming in?

45:15.747 --> 45:17.213
I don't want the massive
tent, ok?

45:17.282 --> 45:18.581
It's not the farm.

45:18.650 --> 45:22.819
I need something that feels
grounded and organic.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.654
Did you just make
a farming joke?

45:29.661 --> 45:30.760
David.

45:32.897 --> 45:34.731
You have an incredible
space here

45:34.799 --> 45:36.432
and I know that we can
turn it into something

45:36.501 --> 45:38.468
really special for them.

45:38.536 --> 45:40.536
Yeah, but where am I supposed
to move everything?

45:40.605 --> 45:41.738
I thought about that.

45:41.806 --> 45:42.805
The old stable.

45:42.874 --> 45:44.173
It's not big enough.

45:44.242 --> 45:47.744
It is if you put the massive
tent into the corral.

45:47.812 --> 45:49.746
Yeah, but then I've gotta
redirect everything,

45:49.814 --> 45:51.380
my crews have gotta work
double shifts,

45:51.449 --> 45:52.582
everybody's gotta come in...

45:52.650 --> 45:56.919
I know, but what does your heart
tell you to do?

45:56.988 --> 45:57.620
Really?

45:57.689 --> 45:58.955
Mmmhmm.

46:00.859 --> 46:01.991
Fine.

46:02.060 --> 46:03.359
Yes. Ok, look, I'm gonna
go on record,

46:03.428 --> 46:04.961
I'm doing this under protest.

46:05.029 --> 46:07.029
You are so lovable.

46:08.099 --> 46:09.098
Thank you.

46:15.774 --> 46:18.674
You want my company
to fix the house

46:18.743 --> 46:21.144
and do all the landscaping?

46:21.212 --> 46:23.412
Look, we would not be asking
you to do this

46:23.481 --> 46:25.248
if it weren't for the fact
that your family owns

46:25.316 --> 46:27.550
one of the most successful
real estate businesses

46:27.619 --> 46:29.085
in all of New York.

46:29.154 --> 46:31.220
I mean, this is not
a big job for you.

46:31.289 --> 46:32.955
Not compared to what
you're used to,

46:33.024 --> 46:35.892
but it does need to be done
right and on time

46:35.960 --> 46:37.960
and Barbara I know
you can do it.

46:39.998 --> 46:42.331
And there's something else.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.432
Yeah.

46:43.501 --> 46:44.801
There's-there's
something else.

46:44.869 --> 46:47.937
We need to change
the wedding.

46:48.006 --> 46:48.971
Excuse me?

46:49.040 --> 46:50.039
You know what?

46:50.108 --> 46:51.541
This is partly my fault
but I mean,

46:51.609 --> 46:55.244
we-we've kinda made this
wedding about us, you know?

46:55.313 --> 46:56.445
About what we want.

46:56.514 --> 47:00.183
About lists and-and getting
a good article.

47:00.251 --> 47:03.085
I mean, if we wanna plan a
perfect wedding

47:03.154 --> 47:05.354
the only way we're gonna
be able to do that

47:05.423 --> 47:08.858
is to give Tom and Abby
what they want.

47:08.927 --> 47:13.262
Because this is their dream.

47:13.331 --> 47:15.731
Not ours.

47:15.800 --> 47:19.802
And, a little something
for the new direction.

47:27.145 --> 47:30.680
You know, Marilyn Monroe
once said

47:30.748 --> 47:35.885
'give a girl the right shoes
and she can conquer the world'.

47:35.954 --> 47:37.820
So what do you say, Barbara?

47:37.889 --> 47:39.121
Come on.

47:39.190 --> 47:41.958
We can't conquer this wedding
without you.

47:42.026 --> 47:43.593
Please, mom?

47:49.167 --> 47:50.600
Is that a yes?

47:55.006 --> 47:55.771
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

47:55.840 --> 47:57.039
It's gonna be beautiful.

47:57.108 --> 47:58.007
Great.

47:58.076 --> 47:59.075
Just what I've always wanted.

47:59.143 --> 48:00.109
A beautiful house.

48:00.178 --> 48:00.943
Come on.

48:01.012 --> 48:02.378
Ok, what do you want?

48:02.447 --> 48:03.346
Handsome?

48:03.414 --> 48:04.480
Even better.

48:04.549 --> 48:06.215
You are impossible
to deal with.

48:06.284 --> 48:07.016
Come on.

48:07.085 --> 48:08.251
Knowing her she's gonna,

48:08.319 --> 48:09.285
like, paint my house silver
or something.

48:09.954 --> 48:11.220
Stop it, David.

48:11.289 --> 48:13.289
Look, you just have to think
of it this way, ok?

48:13.358 --> 48:15.358
You're gonna have more time
for your harvesting

48:15.426 --> 48:17.393
and for all the stuff
I'm making you move.

48:19.097 --> 48:20.529
Fine.

48:22.500 --> 48:25.101
You always could convince me
to do whatever it is you wanted.

48:25.169 --> 48:26.435
That is not true.

48:26.504 --> 48:28.104
Yes, it is.

48:28.172 --> 48:29.338
You want some coffee?

48:29.407 --> 48:31.407
Yeah, please.
Thank you.

48:32.911 --> 48:34.410
So, since you've been back

48:34.479 --> 48:37.513
I've been thinking a lot about
how things were between us.

48:37.582 --> 48:38.347
Yeah?

48:38.416 --> 48:40.516
Yeah.

48:40.585 --> 48:42.618
I can remember pretty much
everything we did, you know,

48:42.687 --> 48:45.187
the good, the bad.

48:45.256 --> 48:48.024
But for the life of me

48:48.092 --> 48:54.664
I can't actually remember
how things ended between us.

48:54.732 --> 48:56.198
I don't know.

48:56.267 --> 48:57.700
Gosh, we were just kids.

48:57.769 --> 48:58.968
Not that there's anything
wrong with that,

48:59.037 --> 49:00.436
I'm just saying when
I went off to school

49:00.505 --> 49:03.372
it's like this whole new world
opened up to me

49:03.441 --> 49:07.043
and I think I just got
a little...

49:07.111 --> 49:08.844
overwhelmed.

49:08.913 --> 49:10.913
Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

49:10.982 --> 49:15.885
I... I was overwhelmed, too,
here at the farm.

49:15.954 --> 49:18.721
You like being a farmer,
don't you?

49:18.790 --> 49:19.588
Yes I do.

49:20.959 --> 49:22.058
I really do, you know.

49:22.126 --> 49:23.926
This is where
I'm supposed to be.

49:24.929 --> 49:27.496
It feels so good
being back here.

49:27.565 --> 49:28.297
Yeah?

49:28.366 --> 49:29.265
Yeah.

49:29.334 --> 49:31.834
I've missed this place.

49:31.903 --> 49:33.536
And I've been doing
some thinking

49:33.604 --> 49:36.372
and I think I'm gonna start
coming back more often.

49:36.441 --> 49:37.340
Yep.

49:37.408 --> 49:38.674
That'd be great.

49:38.743 --> 49:40.710
But what about
the article?

49:40.778 --> 49:42.378
What do you mean?

49:42.447 --> 49:43.512
Well, you said once
the article comes out

49:43.581 --> 49:45.314
things are gonna blow up
for you.

49:45.383 --> 49:48.918
How are you gonna have time
to make that work?

49:48.987 --> 49:51.654
I'm-well, I just meant,
you know,

49:51.723 --> 49:55.424
if... if it's possible
I'd like to.

49:59.564 --> 50:00.329
Who's that?

50:00.398 --> 50:01.297
I forgot.

50:01.366 --> 50:02.965
Peyton's here to pick me up.

50:03.735 --> 50:04.500
Peyton?

50:04.569 --> 50:06.135
I thought you drove here.

50:10.575 --> 50:13.909
Emma needed the car so
she just dropped me off.

50:13.978 --> 50:15.811
How are ya, buddy?

50:15.880 --> 50:17.313
Hey.

50:19.183 --> 50:20.182
You know, I could have
given you a ride

50:20.251 --> 50:21.817
where you needed to go.

50:21.886 --> 50:23.185
Don't be ridiculous.

50:23.254 --> 50:25.187
We're going to the same place.

50:25.256 --> 50:29.959
Besides, didn't I just give
you a lot of work to do?

50:30.028 --> 50:31.227
I'm joking.

50:31.295 --> 50:32.395
Listen, don't worry
about the house, ok?

50:32.463 --> 50:34.330
I promise.
Everything will be perfect.

50:34.399 --> 50:36.665
Silver everything.

50:42.373 --> 50:42.772
Hi there.

50:42.840 --> 50:43.339
Hi.

50:43.408 --> 50:43.839
You ready?

50:43.908 --> 50:44.440
Yeah.

50:57.455 --> 50:59.722
Who wants to get married?

51:05.496 --> 51:06.462
Sandwiches.

51:07.565 --> 51:08.898
Thanks, dad.

51:11.102 --> 51:13.235
I know this is a really
big move, ok?

51:13.304 --> 51:14.970
And it couldn't have come
at a worse time

51:15.039 --> 51:16.705
but I also know that
we can do this.

51:18.709 --> 51:19.975
Ok, any questions?

51:22.847 --> 51:24.380
Great.

51:30.488 --> 51:34.256
Yes. A hand-tied clutch bouquet
of traditional flowers.

51:34.325 --> 51:37.493
Simple yet elegant.

51:37.562 --> 51:40.696
I love it.

51:40.765 --> 51:42.798
Exactly what I wanted.

51:42.867 --> 51:44.233
That hedge is perfect.

51:44.302 --> 51:46.202
Now, if you could just move
that potted plant

51:46.270 --> 51:48.504
a little bit over to the left.

51:48.573 --> 51:49.905
Food, ladies.

52:00.918 --> 52:02.184
That's good.

52:02.253 --> 52:05.488
And now all this landscaping
needs to be redone.

52:21.472 --> 52:22.371
Where do you want me?

52:22.440 --> 52:23.772
First stall over here.

53:22.466 --> 53:23.365
I'm serious. Tell me
something you think

53:23.434 --> 53:25.501
I wouldn't know about a wedding.

53:25.570 --> 53:27.836
Something you wouldn't know
about a wedding?

53:27.905 --> 53:29.805
I thought
you knew everything.

53:29.874 --> 53:32.074
Well, let's see if you can
surprise me.

53:32.143 --> 53:33.576
Let's see.

53:33.644 --> 53:36.312
I know something.

53:36.380 --> 53:38.280
Do you know why we have
a ring finger?

53:40.751 --> 53:41.884
Actually, I don't know.

53:41.953 --> 53:43.485
You don't know.

53:43.554 --> 53:46.322
Alright, it's because it's
the only finger that has a vein

53:46.390 --> 53:50.025
that goes straight
to your heart.

53:50.094 --> 53:51.026
You surprised me.

53:55.967 --> 53:57.333
No.

54:00.037 --> 54:01.704
Hold on. I'll be right back.

54:06.744 --> 54:10.346
Hey, what's wrong?

54:10.414 --> 54:12.047
The wedding's off.

54:28.799 --> 54:31.934
I mean, I answered
his question, that's it.

54:32.003 --> 54:32.534
Ok.

54:32.603 --> 54:33.569
And I told him.

54:33.638 --> 54:34.737
I said that things
are moving fast

54:34.805 --> 54:37.039
because, hello,
they're moving fast.

54:37.108 --> 54:38.574
Very fast.

54:40.845 --> 54:42.411
I didn't mean anything.

54:42.480 --> 54:43.646
I told him the truth.

54:43.714 --> 54:44.913
What was I supposed to do?

54:44.982 --> 54:46.181
Lie to him?

54:46.250 --> 54:48.217
Of course I don't want her
to lie to me.

54:48.286 --> 54:49.718
Of course.

54:49.787 --> 54:50.953
But when she tells me
it's going fast,

54:51.022 --> 54:52.988
how am I supposed
to interpret that?

54:53.057 --> 54:55.157
Maybe the way
she meant it?

54:55.226 --> 54:56.392
I'm sorry.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.227
There's just so much going
on right now

54:58.296 --> 54:59.662
with his deployment coming up

54:59.764 --> 55:01.730
and with all of these last
minute changes with the wedding,

55:01.799 --> 55:04.066
which I love by the way.

55:04.135 --> 55:05.301
Then you know what he does?

55:05.369 --> 55:06.402
He freaks out.

55:06.470 --> 55:08.404
He totally freaks out.

55:08.472 --> 55:09.872
I did not freak out.

55:09.974 --> 55:14.143
I was very calm and I just asked
her if maybe we should wait.

55:14.211 --> 55:16.912
And then he starts grilling
me with all of these questions,

55:16.981 --> 55:19.148
asking if this is what
I really want,

55:19.216 --> 55:22.251
if this is right,
if we're right.

55:22.320 --> 55:23.752
I mean, of course
we're right.

55:23.821 --> 55:26.188
I knew we were right before
he knew we were right.

55:26.257 --> 55:27.423
I mean, don't I have a right
to know?

55:27.491 --> 55:29.358
Yeah, of course you do.

55:29.427 --> 55:31.393
But you're a dope
because you already knew.

55:31.462 --> 55:33.462
<i>Have a seat, brother.</i>

55:33.531 --> 55:35.431
<i>Have a seat, Abby.</i>

55:37.535 --> 55:39.468
What am I gonna do?

55:39.537 --> 55:41.904
Abby, you're not
gonna do anything.

55:41.972 --> 55:44.973
Sweetie, these are just jitters.

55:45.042 --> 55:47.676
They're like the little hiccups
of weddings.

55:47.745 --> 55:51.180
In fact, I would be worried
if one of you didn't have them.

55:51.248 --> 55:52.181
Really?

55:52.249 --> 55:53.882
Yes.

55:53.951 --> 55:59.121
You know, you've been going
a million miles per hour.

55:59.190 --> 56:04.326
I bet your head feels like
it's spinning out of control.

56:04.395 --> 56:06.061
Falling in love?

56:06.130 --> 56:08.931
You know, that's...
that's the easy part.

56:08.999 --> 56:11.233
But figuring out how
to make it all work?

56:11.302 --> 56:12.768
That's the hard part.

56:12.837 --> 56:15.604
When you find somebody
who believes in what you two

56:15.673 --> 56:18.507
can be together?

56:18.576 --> 56:21.243
That's the magic.

56:21.312 --> 56:23.379
And you don't wanna
let that go.

56:25.116 --> 56:26.915
You got this.

56:46.804 --> 56:49.705
I am selfish and self-centered.

56:49.774 --> 56:51.106
And a dope.

56:52.710 --> 56:58.180
And a dope, and I am just
so sorry, baby.

56:58.249 --> 56:59.915
All I wanna say to you is that
you knew we were right

56:59.984 --> 57:01.784
before I knew we were right.

57:09.460 --> 57:11.560
Mission accomplished.

57:11.629 --> 57:14.963
Yeah, I'd say so.

57:15.032 --> 57:18.233
By the way I'm definitely
gonna get that tractor running.

57:18.302 --> 57:20.536
You know what?
I was thinking about that

57:20.604 --> 57:23.372
and since we changed
the theme of the wedding

57:23.441 --> 57:25.240
it actually kinda works.

57:25.309 --> 57:28.243
I say leave it.
I like it.

57:28.312 --> 57:28.977
Are you kidding me?

57:29.046 --> 57:30.045
What about the bet?

57:30.114 --> 57:31.980
I was gonna get
the tractor running.

57:33.884 --> 57:38.954
Well, in that case
I'll just assume you did.

57:40.558 --> 57:41.623
So I win the bet.

57:43.627 --> 57:45.394
And a home-cooked meal.

57:46.730 --> 57:47.629
<i>See ya later tonight.</i>

57:47.698 --> 57:49.031
Yep.

57:49.099 --> 57:51.300
You didn't win though.

57:51.368 --> 57:52.568
I let you win.

58:06.317 --> 58:07.416
What was that?

58:11.188 --> 58:13.155
You just made a face.

58:13.224 --> 58:14.623
What? I didn't make a face.

58:14.692 --> 58:17.125
Yeah you did,
I just saw you.

58:17.194 --> 58:18.961
Ok fine, maybe I made
a little bit of a face

58:19.029 --> 58:21.697
but that's just, you know,
because your soup is

58:21.765 --> 58:23.432
so, exciting tasting.

58:24.201 --> 58:25.300
Exciting tasting?

58:25.369 --> 58:26.101
Yeah.

58:27.271 --> 58:28.070
Well, I'm sorry,
but you know what?

58:28.138 --> 58:29.004
I happen to be a city girl.

58:29.073 --> 58:30.672
I don't really cook for myself.

58:30.741 --> 58:32.508
Is that because you wanna live?

58:32.576 --> 58:34.042
That's not nice.

58:34.111 --> 58:37.179
It may be a little bit true
but it's not nice.

58:39.884 --> 58:42.217
Hey, cheers.

58:42.286 --> 58:43.585
What're we cheering to?

58:43.654 --> 58:44.686
We're cheering to you,

58:44.755 --> 58:46.121
actually pulling off
this wedding.

58:46.190 --> 58:46.855
No!

58:46.924 --> 58:47.556
No, no, no, no, no.

58:47.625 --> 58:48.156
Don't do that.

58:50.194 --> 58:52.294
You just jinxed me.

58:52.363 --> 58:54.329
See, if there's one thing
that I've learned

58:54.398 --> 58:57.666
is even with all the planning
in the world

58:57.735 --> 59:00.235
life still throws little
surprises at you.

59:01.906 --> 59:02.571
Yeah.

59:02.640 --> 59:04.239
Yeah, tell me about it.

59:05.876 --> 59:07.442
You know what?

59:07.511 --> 59:10.379
There was something I wanted
to talk to you about.

59:10.447 --> 59:14.917
You know, while I was making
your very exciting tasting soup,

59:14.985 --> 59:20.155
I ran across more of this.

59:20.224 --> 59:21.423
You got a lot of them
in there.

59:21.492 --> 59:25.360
Alright? So you're stuck
with me.

59:25.429 --> 59:26.862
What is it? Tell me.

59:26.931 --> 59:29.998
This is bonding insulator.

59:30.067 --> 59:31.066
Bonding insulator?

59:31.135 --> 59:31.900
Ok.

59:31.969 --> 59:34.369
What is bonding insulator?

59:34.438 --> 59:38.807
Well, this is basically
organic tar.

59:38.876 --> 59:40.609
You can put it on your roof,
you can put it on a road,

59:40.678 --> 59:42.911
but you know, the really
cool thing about this is,

59:42.980 --> 59:47.115
if it works, is that you can
actually grow things in it.

59:47.184 --> 59:50.452
When did you get in to
agricultural chemistry?

59:50.521 --> 59:52.521
I picked up a few things
here and there.

59:52.590 --> 59:57.025
But I'm also working with a
professor over at the college.

59:57.094 --> 59:57.859
Ok. Alright, hold on.

59:57.928 --> 59:59.194
So let me get this straight.

59:59.263 --> 01:00:05.601
If this works you can basically
grow anything anywhere?

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:07.002
Theoretically.

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:08.503
But right now we're just
playing around with this.

01:00:08.572 --> 01:00:10.005
This is just fun, you know?

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:12.574
It's like we're wrestling
with mother nature.

01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:14.543
Ok, but what do you plan on
doing with it?

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:16.778
Have you talked
to any investors?

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:20.616
No. No, I don't-I don't have
time for any of that.

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:22.351
Well, David, if it's something
you believe in

01:00:22.419 --> 01:00:24.586
then you make time.

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:26.321
Do you know how many years
that would take?

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:31.593
Really, there would be testing
and then years with the FDA.

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:32.527
No, no, no.

01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:33.929
David. David.

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:37.532
How do you expect to know
what's possible

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:39.468
if you don't even try?

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:47.409
Wait.

01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:48.510
What's wrong?

01:00:48.579 --> 01:00:50.145
I just...

01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:51.980
I thought that you...
I...

01:00:52.049 --> 01:00:55.651
You know what? Maybe I...
Maybe I should go.

01:00:55.719 --> 01:00:57.486
What-what's going on here?

01:00:57.554 --> 01:00:59.287
Nothing.

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:00.455
Do you wanna go right now?

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:01.923
Well, I just have
a lot of work to do.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.158
No. Sarah.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:10.032
I... I need to go.

01:01:35.876 --> 01:01:36.942
Hey.

01:01:39.146 --> 01:01:40.479
You're back early.

01:01:42.516 --> 01:01:44.116
Dinner wasn't good?

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:46.451
No.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.787
I mean yeah, no, dinner...
dinner was fine.

01:01:48.856 --> 01:01:52.991
Did, Collin Shaw
send over a menu?

01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.092
He did.

01:01:54.161 --> 01:01:56.261
Ok, good.

01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:59.865
I wanna check
the place settings

01:01:59.933 --> 01:02:03.502
for each one of the tables
and, the...

01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:06.405
Sarah?

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:08.507
Are you ok, honey?

01:02:10.844 --> 01:02:12.244
Yeah.

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:24.189
Hey.

01:02:24.258 --> 01:02:25.357
Hey.

01:02:25.426 --> 01:02:27.626
What are you-what
are you doing here?

01:02:27.694 --> 01:02:28.960
I... I was wondering if
I could coax you out

01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:31.930
for a quick nightcap.

01:02:34.768 --> 01:02:36.401
I was hoping we could go over
a few more details

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:38.336
about the article.

01:02:38.405 --> 01:02:40.705
My editor is really hoping
to see a few pages tomorrow

01:02:40.774 --> 01:02:42.707
and I was just... I don't
know, I was thinking

01:02:42.776 --> 01:02:45.610
if I showed up I might be able
to twist your arm.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:46.611
Please?

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.513
You'd really be
helping me out.

01:02:50.551 --> 01:02:54.386
Yeah.

01:02:54.455 --> 01:02:55.020
Yeah.

01:02:55.088 --> 01:02:57.522
Ok.

01:02:57.591 --> 01:02:59.291
It won't be long, I promise.

01:03:01.261 --> 01:03:02.194
I'll be back.

01:03:06.667 --> 01:03:07.866
So the couple's
on the dance floor

01:03:07.935 --> 01:03:09.301
and they're dancing, right?

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:12.471
But when the groom spins her
she totally loses control

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:15.006
and she goes sailing
right into the pool!

01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:19.578
Hang on, you didn't plan
that wedding, did you?

01:03:19.646 --> 01:03:21.112
No, no.

01:03:21.181 --> 01:03:22.080
I didn't plan that wedding.

01:03:22.149 --> 01:03:24.082
Peyton, I'm sorry.

01:03:24.151 --> 01:03:25.784
I'm sorry, I'm horrible company.

01:03:25.853 --> 01:03:28.620
It was actually a really
funny story I just... you know,

01:03:28.689 --> 01:03:30.088
I got this wedding coming up

01:03:30.157 --> 01:03:32.657
but my head's kind of
everywhere right now.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:34.426
I shouldn't have asked you
out tonight.

01:03:34.495 --> 01:03:35.727
No.

01:03:35.796 --> 01:03:37.229
No, if it's for the article
I wanna help.

01:03:41.869 --> 01:03:44.135
What?

01:03:44.204 --> 01:03:46.938
Look, I didn't expect this,
but...

01:03:47.007 --> 01:03:48.006
What? What's wrong?

01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:49.741
Nothing. Nothing's wrong,

01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:54.379
I just... I've just really had
a great time being here,

01:03:54.448 --> 01:03:57.082
getting to know you.

01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:58.984
Me too.

01:03:59.052 --> 01:04:04.256
And I'm really liking
the article but...

01:04:04.324 --> 01:04:11.463
I've also realized that
I'm really liking you, too.

01:04:11.532 --> 01:04:14.399
I think you and I could
really hit it off.

01:04:14.468 --> 01:04:15.967
We have so much in common.

01:04:16.036 --> 01:04:19.271
Our work, we're both
career-oriented people,

01:04:19.339 --> 01:04:20.839
big dreamers.

01:04:20.908 --> 01:04:22.641
We both love New York.

01:04:22.709 --> 01:04:24.976
And we've had so much fun
these last couple of weeks,

01:04:25.045 --> 01:04:26.011
haven't we?

01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:27.779
Yeah.

01:04:27.848 --> 01:04:29.281
Yeah, we have, Peyton.

01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:30.348
But it...

01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:31.816
I know, I know,
the wedding, I know.

01:04:31.885 --> 01:04:33.685
My timing couldn't be worse,
but I don't know,

01:04:33.754 --> 01:04:36.187
when we're back in the city
maybe we could...

01:04:36.256 --> 01:04:38.924
we could go out sometime.

01:04:44.598 --> 01:04:47.432
You know, will you just
excuse me for one second?

01:04:47.501 --> 01:04:48.300
Sure.

01:04:48.368 --> 01:04:49.334
Is everything alright?

01:04:49.403 --> 01:04:50.735
Yeah, everything's fine,

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:52.571
I just have to use the ladies
room, that's all.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:53.905
I'll be right back.

01:04:53.974 --> 01:04:54.773
Excuse me.

01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:55.740
Sorry.

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:57.242
Thanks.

01:04:57.744 --> 01:04:58.743
Sarah.

01:04:58.812 --> 01:04:59.544
Hey.

01:04:59.613 --> 01:05:00.445
What're you doing here?

01:05:01.415 --> 01:05:02.180
I thought you had
to work.

01:05:02.249 --> 01:05:03.315
I do.

01:05:03.383 --> 01:05:05.317
I mean, I did.

01:05:05.385 --> 01:05:06.685
I do have to work.

01:05:08.455 --> 01:05:10.655
You're here with Peyton.

01:05:10.724 --> 01:05:11.656
No, no.

01:05:11.725 --> 01:05:12.724
That's not what it looks like.

01:05:12.793 --> 01:05:13.892
I mean, it is
what it looks like

01:05:13.961 --> 01:05:14.826
but I really don't want it
to be.

01:05:14.895 --> 01:05:15.660
It's just kind of one of those...

01:05:15.729 --> 01:05:16.895
Don't worry about it.

01:05:16.964 --> 01:05:17.495
What?

01:05:17.564 --> 01:05:18.663
No, no, no, no.

01:05:18.732 --> 01:05:19.798
Hey, Sarah.

01:05:19.866 --> 01:05:21.733
I really don't need you
to explain.

01:05:21.802 --> 01:05:23.668
Have a good night.

01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:27.939
Peyton.

01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:30.575
David, hi.

01:05:30.644 --> 01:05:32.644
Write a good article for her,
would you?

01:05:32.713 --> 01:05:34.679
She deserves it.

01:05:34.748 --> 01:05:36.181
I know.

01:05:43.957 --> 01:05:44.856
David!

01:05:46.159 --> 01:05:47.225
David!

01:06:20.994 --> 01:06:22.027
Hey, honey.

01:06:22.095 --> 01:06:23.628
Hey, dad.

01:06:25.432 --> 01:06:26.698
You ok?

01:06:29.036 --> 01:06:30.301
Yeah.

01:06:33.373 --> 01:06:34.773
I know.

01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:38.677
Coming back home
can be hard sometimes.

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:41.479
Yeah.

01:06:41.548 --> 01:06:48.119
I just didn't know that coming
back here and seeing him...

01:06:48.188 --> 01:06:50.555
I didn't know I was gonna have
all these feelings.

01:06:51.725 --> 01:06:58.329
And now I do and I'm...
just confused.

01:06:58.398 --> 01:06:59.931
Why not give it a shot?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.233
Maybe see what happens?

01:07:02.302 --> 01:07:03.635
Dad.

01:07:03.704 --> 01:07:06.037
How is that gonna work?

01:07:06.106 --> 01:07:09.240
I mean, we live two totally
separate lives.

01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:11.976
Sure, but how can you know
what's possible

01:07:12.045 --> 01:07:14.245
if you don't even try?

01:07:40.107 --> 01:07:43.108
This is the head table
so please make it perfect.

01:07:43.176 --> 01:07:45.643
Thank you.

01:07:45.712 --> 01:07:48.113
Can we add a candle
to that table?

01:07:48.181 --> 01:07:49.914
Easy with the stemware please.

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:51.382
I'm gonna need you
to get up on a ladder

01:07:51.451 --> 01:07:53.218
and just straighten that
chandelier for me.

01:07:53.286 --> 01:07:54.853
Soup spoon on the right.

01:07:54.921 --> 01:07:56.421
Double knot the back
of that chair.

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.323
I'm gonna need you to go get the
rest of the stemware, please.

01:07:58.391 --> 01:08:00.492
DJ booth goes right there.

01:08:07.267 --> 01:08:07.866
Hi.

01:08:07.934 --> 01:08:08.600
Hi.

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:09.601
Just looking for Sarah?

01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:10.869
Yeah.

01:08:10.937 --> 01:08:11.970
She's-she's right in there.

01:08:12.038 --> 01:08:13.037
Thank you.

01:08:17.444 --> 01:08:18.877
Hey.

01:08:18.944 --> 01:08:21.479
Hey.

01:08:21.548 --> 01:08:23.247
Sorry about last night.

01:08:23.316 --> 01:08:24.816
No, I'm-I'm sorry.

01:08:24.885 --> 01:08:26.618
It was it was very
unprofessional of me

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:29.520
to just spring that on you.

01:08:29.589 --> 01:08:32.323
And Peyton, I'm flattered,
but I just...

01:08:32.392 --> 01:08:34.492
I can't think about
that right now.

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.162
Friends in the meantime?

01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:38.997
Friends.

01:08:39.064 --> 01:08:40.999
Ok, come on. I have
to show you.

01:09:21.942 --> 01:09:22.874
Hey.

01:09:22.943 --> 01:09:24.142
Hey there.

01:09:24.211 --> 01:09:26.176
I was looking for you.
When did you get back?

01:09:26.246 --> 01:09:28.680
About ten minutes ago.

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:29.747
I'm sorry I didn't...

01:09:29.816 --> 01:09:30.481
No, no, no.

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:31.182
It's ok.

01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:32.850
Tom told me.

01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:36.754
Listen David, I think
we need to talk.

01:09:36.823 --> 01:09:37.822
Yes, we do.

01:09:37.890 --> 01:09:39.724
I agree.

01:09:39.792 --> 01:09:41.526
But first we gotta get
through this.

01:09:41.595 --> 01:09:42.660
Get through what?

01:09:42.729 --> 01:09:43.761
There she is.

01:09:45.298 --> 01:09:46.598
Mrs. Nichols!

01:09:46.666 --> 01:09:48.166
I cannot believe it!

01:09:48.234 --> 01:09:51.169
It has been way too long,
young lady!

01:09:51.238 --> 01:09:52.069
I know.

01:09:52.138 --> 01:09:53.203
So good to see you.

01:09:53.273 --> 01:09:54.739
This is the craziest thing ever,

01:09:54.808 --> 01:09:57.809
you turning out to be Tommy
and Abby's wedding planner.

01:09:57.878 --> 01:09:58.877
I know.

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:00.545
Now come on, I wanna
hear everything.

01:10:00.614 --> 01:10:02.714
I wanna hear about New York,

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:04.315
I wanna hear what
you've been doing,

01:10:04.384 --> 01:10:07.986
I wanna hear about all these
weddings you've been planning.

01:10:27.674 --> 01:10:28.539
There you are.

01:10:28.608 --> 01:10:30.041
I thought I'd find you here.

01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:31.342
Hey.

01:10:31.411 --> 01:10:33.645
Yeah, I know, I was just
triple checking everything

01:10:33.713 --> 01:10:34.746
before the big day.

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:36.047
Yeah.

01:10:36.116 --> 01:10:38.182
I gotta say,
everything looks great.

01:10:38.251 --> 01:10:40.952
And I hate to admit that Barbara
actually did a fantastic job

01:10:41.021 --> 01:10:41.853
with the house.

01:10:41.922 --> 01:10:43.254
She did.

01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:45.623
It looks beautiful and
handsome all at the same time.

01:10:51.398 --> 01:10:54.065
David, maybe we should
give it a shot.

01:10:56.770 --> 01:10:58.469
What're you talking about?

01:10:58.538 --> 01:10:59.971
Us.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.706
You know.

01:11:01.775 --> 01:11:05.576
Maybe, I don't know,
maybe we should go on a date.

01:11:05.645 --> 01:11:08.346
You know, like an actual date.

01:11:08.415 --> 01:11:10.348
I didn't know how I was gonna
feel about you

01:11:10.417 --> 01:11:12.250
before I came here.

01:11:12.319 --> 01:11:13.584
I thought we had both moved on.

01:11:13.653 --> 01:11:14.786
I thought we were
different people.

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:16.454
Yeah, so did I.

01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:18.856
But over the past
couple of weeks

01:11:18.925 --> 01:11:22.660
I think that
I've realized that...

01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:25.730
it still feels
so much the same.

01:11:29.936 --> 01:11:31.536
Yeah, what about
you and Peyton?

01:11:31.604 --> 01:11:33.471
There's no 'me and Peyton', ok?

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:37.108
Peyton likes me,
that's it.

01:11:37.177 --> 01:11:44.382
But the thing is,
is I like you.

01:11:44.451 --> 01:11:48.119
And I just keep thinking
about when we were growing up

01:11:48.188 --> 01:11:51.022
we were so good together

01:11:51.091 --> 01:11:54.659
and I guess what I'm trying
to say is

01:11:54.728 --> 01:11:59.998
maybe we could be
like that again.

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:01.165
What about the other night?

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:03.701
Ok, I panicked.

01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:08.673
I was-so much going on and I
don't know what I was thinking.

01:12:08.742 --> 01:12:11.476
I think you did the right thing.

01:12:11.544 --> 01:12:12.643
What?

01:12:12.712 --> 01:12:13.745
Yeah.

01:12:13.813 --> 01:12:16.881
I should have never tried.

01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:18.282
Why are you saying that?

01:12:18.351 --> 01:12:20.151
Because, look, we're
clinging on to the past, ok?

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.220
That-that's what it was.

01:12:22.288 --> 01:12:23.888
It's the past.

01:12:23.957 --> 01:12:24.756
I'm here now.

01:12:24.824 --> 01:12:25.957
This is me.

01:12:26.026 --> 01:12:27.125
This is what I do,
and you have so much.

01:12:27.193 --> 01:12:29.494
You got the whole future
opening up to you.

01:12:29.562 --> 01:12:32.697
We could split our time.

01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:34.265
And what about your experiment?

01:12:34.334 --> 01:12:35.700
Experiment.

01:12:35.769 --> 01:12:36.834
I know people in New York
who can help you with that.

01:12:36.903 --> 01:12:38.036
Sarah, listen.

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:39.470
I took your advice
about the experiment.

01:12:39.539 --> 01:12:42.507
I went and talked to this
investment guy in North Hampton.

01:12:42.575 --> 01:12:43.341
He didn't bite.

01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:44.509
He thought it was a joke.

01:12:44.577 --> 01:12:48.446
That was just one guy, ok?

01:12:48.515 --> 01:12:50.915
And if that's the way he felt
then he's the joke.

01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:56.054
Why can't we try?

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:58.756
Sarah, we did try, ok?

01:12:58.825 --> 01:13:00.525
We fell in love
when we were kids

01:13:00.593 --> 01:13:02.493
but that was a long time ago.

01:13:02.562 --> 01:13:04.829
Now we've moved on, we're
living different lives,

01:13:04.898 --> 01:13:07.065
and reminiscing about that,

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:10.001
that's not gonna
change anything.

01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:13.304
Maybe... I don't know.

01:13:13.373 --> 01:13:17.442
Maybe what we were is all
we were ever supposed to be.

01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:19.110
I'm sorry.

01:13:23.716 --> 01:13:25.616
Alright.

01:13:25.685 --> 01:13:28.152
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna go.

01:13:28.221 --> 01:13:29.287
Sarah.

01:13:29.355 --> 01:13:30.721
Excuse me.

01:13:51.945 --> 01:13:53.744
This is it.

01:14:20.106 --> 01:14:23.241
Emma, Collin Shaw's restaurant
just burned down.

01:14:23.309 --> 01:14:24.609
A kitchen fire?

01:14:24.677 --> 01:14:26.144
He was prepping food to bring
to the wedding today

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:28.246
and wound up cooking
the entire restaurant.

01:14:28.314 --> 01:14:29.180
What're we gonna do?

01:14:29.249 --> 01:14:31.149
I have no idea.

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:33.151
I know, maybe I can do
a grocery run?

01:14:34.888 --> 01:14:36.254
Yeah, I'll call some friends
and we'll all go together and...

01:14:36.322 --> 01:14:37.588
Dad, dad, no, no, no.

01:14:37.657 --> 01:14:38.789
That's...

01:14:44.564 --> 01:14:46.697
you're a genius.

01:14:46.766 --> 01:14:48.733
You're a genius, pop.

01:14:48.801 --> 01:14:50.301
What're you doing?

01:14:50.370 --> 01:14:52.470
I'm doing what I should have
done from the very beginning.

01:14:57.777 --> 01:14:58.643
David?

01:15:01.614 --> 01:15:02.847
David.

01:15:04.184 --> 01:15:05.082
David.

01:15:05.151 --> 01:15:06.517
Yeah, what's up?

01:15:06.586 --> 01:15:08.452
My chef had a kitchen fire
and accidentally burned down

01:15:08.521 --> 01:15:12.690
his whole restaurant with
all of the food for the wedding.

01:15:12.759 --> 01:15:14.025
Well, that doesn't sound good.

01:15:14.093 --> 01:15:16.360
What're you gonna do?

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:18.729
Aren't we in the middle
of fall harvest?

01:15:18.798 --> 01:15:19.564
Yeah.

01:15:19.632 --> 01:15:20.765
Yeah.

01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:32.009
He's here.

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:41.652
Mr. Shaw?

01:15:41.721 --> 01:15:44.388
Welcome to Williamstown.

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:45.823
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

01:15:45.892 --> 01:15:47.124
Everything was ruined.

01:15:47.193 --> 01:15:48.859
What do you expect me to do?

01:16:10.216 --> 01:16:11.882
Let's get to work, people.

01:16:11.951 --> 01:16:13.150
Yes, chef!

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.559
Come in.

01:16:28.835 --> 01:16:30.301
It's time.

01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:31.636
<i>We are all here today
to celebrate the relationship</i>

01:16:31.704 --> 01:16:37.008
<i>of Thomas and Abigail
to be witnessed...</i>

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.768
<i>May we have the rings?</i>

01:17:08.241 --> 01:17:09.173
David?

01:17:09.242 --> 01:17:10.274
David?

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.080
Hey the rings?

01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.847
The what?

01:17:16.916 --> 01:17:17.748
<i>The rings, please.</i>

01:17:17.817 --> 01:17:18.582
Yeah.

01:17:18.651 --> 01:17:19.750
That would probably help.

01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:25.690
Ooops!

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:34.699
<i>Abigail, do you take Thomas
to be your husband</i>

01:17:34.767 --> 01:17:36.567
<i>for as long as you both
shall live?</i>

01:17:36.636 --> 01:17:37.835
<i>I do.</i>

01:17:37.904 --> 01:17:39.870
<i>And Thomas, do you take Abigail
to be your wife</i>

01:17:39.939 --> 01:17:42.573
<i>for as long as you both
shall live?</i>

01:17:42.642 --> 01:17:43.974
<i>I do.</i>

01:17:45.044 --> 01:17:45.976
<i>You may kiss your bride.</i>

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:02.727
<i>To Tom and Abbey!</i>

01:18:02.795 --> 01:18:04.695
<i>Cheers!</i>

01:18:30.089 --> 01:18:31.389
Hey.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.090
Hey.

01:18:33.159 --> 01:18:35.993
So it's almost time for David's
speech but I can't find him.

01:18:36.062 --> 01:18:37.027
I'll find him.

01:18:37.096 --> 01:18:37.862
Ok.

01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:38.696
Thanks.

01:18:38.765 --> 01:18:40.898
Mmmhmm.

01:18:55.281 --> 01:18:56.313
Hey.

01:19:01.854 --> 01:19:05.589
He is outside, by the tree.

01:19:20.606 --> 01:19:23.874
<i>Please join them
on the dance floor.</i>

01:19:52.572 --> 01:19:55.506
Hey. Everybody's looking
for you.

01:19:55.575 --> 01:19:57.608
It's time for your big speech.

01:20:12.058 --> 01:20:14.124
I just gotta say I'm sorry.

01:20:15.361 --> 01:20:17.528
Why?

01:20:17.597 --> 01:20:19.997
Because you're right.

01:20:20.066 --> 01:20:22.867
We were good together.

01:20:22.935 --> 01:20:28.339
And I wish things had worked
out between us.

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:32.376
Me too.

01:20:32.445 --> 01:20:36.680
I'd really like to believe that
we could be something more but,

01:20:36.749 --> 01:20:40.451
honestly, the thought of
losing you again,

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.254
that's what's really
stopping me.

01:20:43.322 --> 01:20:45.990
Yeah, but if we don't try...

01:20:46.058 --> 01:20:47.424
We'll never know
what's possible.

01:20:47.493 --> 01:20:49.860
Yeah.

01:20:57.136 --> 01:20:59.904
You once said
something to me.

01:20:59.972 --> 01:21:01.705
You told me that I should
always follow my dreams

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:03.307
no matter where they lead.

01:21:03.376 --> 01:21:07.878
Yeah, I remember that.

01:21:07.947 --> 01:21:10.014
What about now?

01:21:13.419 --> 01:21:16.520
I just realized that my dream

01:21:16.589 --> 01:21:19.356
is standing right here
in front of me.

01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:39.143
Let's go back inside.

01:21:41.314 --> 01:21:45.082
<i>Like I said, even with all
the planning in the world,</i>

01:21:45.151 --> 01:21:47.952
<i>life always finds a way
to surprise you.</i>

01:21:52.525 --> 01:21:54.925
<i>It was a beautiful wedding.</i>

01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:56.393
<i>Collin Shaw
and David's friends</i>

01:21:56.462 --> 01:21:58.195
<i>put together one of
the finest meals</i>

01:21:58.264 --> 01:22:00.197
<i>I have ever tasted.</i>

01:22:00.266 --> 01:22:03.133
Ladies and gentlemen,
Chef Collin Shaw.

01:22:08.874 --> 01:22:13.177
<i>And it reminded me that
sometimes the smallest towns</i>

01:22:13.245 --> 01:22:16.413
<i>can have the biggest hearts.</i>

01:22:16.482 --> 01:22:18.816
<i>And if you're wondering
about the magazine,</i>

01:22:18.884 --> 01:22:21.919
<i>I did get the cover story.</i>

01:22:21.988 --> 01:22:24.622
<i>And even though I finally
got what I wanted,</i>

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:28.659
<i>I also learned how to slow
things down a bit.</i>

01:22:29.962 --> 01:22:32.830
<i>You know, not plan as much.</i>

01:22:32.898 --> 01:22:38.702
<i>Try to relax and enjoy all
of life's little surprises.</i>

01:22:38.771 --> 01:22:40.838
I like it here.

01:22:40.906 --> 01:22:43.707
Yeah, me too.
