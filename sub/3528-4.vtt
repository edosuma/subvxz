WEBVTT

02:23.393 --> 02:25.561
God, of infinite goodness...

02:25.729 --> 02:28.523
...send prosperous life and long...

02:28.982 --> 02:32.401
...to the high and mighty
Princess of England...

02:32.569 --> 02:34.362
...Elizabeth.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.265
There can be no question
of her legitimacy.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.103
You will prepare a bill to put
before Parliament.

03:07.271 --> 03:11.691
It will state that the line of succession
is now firmly vested in our children...

03:11.859 --> 03:13.067
...and no others.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.612
I shall do
as Your Majesty commands.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.075
I am mindful, Mr. Cromwell,
that there are some people...

03:21.243 --> 03:24.954
...some wrong-headed,
some biased people...

03:25.122 --> 03:29.125
...are still unwilling to accept the
validity of my marriage to the queen.

03:29.751 --> 03:35.631
In view of that, l think some sanction
should be made against them.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.384
Everyone will be given
their opportunity...

03:38.552 --> 03:41.053
...to demonstrate their loyalty.

03:45.517 --> 03:48.019
I am told that the lady
is much dismayed...

03:48.186 --> 03:52.356
...at having given birth to a daughter
and not the son she promised.

03:52.983 --> 03:57.153
To my mind, it is sure proof
that God has abandoned her.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.657
How is my mother, the queen?

04:01.825 --> 04:05.328
Alas, l cannot visit or speak to her.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.331
I have little communications
with her ladies.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.833
And they tell me she is still strong...

04:11.001 --> 04:14.003
...but always begs the king,
your father...

04:14.171 --> 04:16.839
...of his mercy,
to be allowed to see you.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.676
I am sure His Majesty
will one day relent...

04:21.345 --> 04:23.179
...for l think....

04:24.348 --> 04:28.643
I believe with all my heart
that he still loves and cares for me.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.939
Oh, l am sure that he does.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.695
Bishop Tunstall.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.697
Sir Thomas.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.240
Please.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.911
Thank you.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.541
To what do I owe this honour?

04:53.585 --> 04:56.754
We have known each other
a long time, Sir Thomas.

04:56.922 --> 05:02.510
Now you've retired from public life
and l never see you.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.721
Naturally, l was concerned
about your welfare.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.391
I am very well, thank you.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.353
But l am--

05:13.146 --> 05:16.774
I am exercised by the fact
that one of our old acquaintances...

05:16.942 --> 05:18.484
...is still under house arrest.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.236
You mean Bishop Fisher?

05:21.738 --> 05:24.699
Yes, the outcome is regrettable.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.867
The outcome of what?

05:27.244 --> 05:29.328
His intransigence.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.415
I see.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.376
Tell me...

05:35.544 --> 05:37.586
...has the king sent you here
to see me?

05:40.716 --> 05:42.925
His Majesty wondered...

05:43.093 --> 05:45.761
...why you did not attend
the queen's coronation...

05:46.179 --> 05:47.930
...as you were invited to do.

05:48.098 --> 05:52.184
Well, in answer to that, let me--

05:52.352 --> 05:54.770
Let me show my poor mind to you.

05:56.648 --> 06:00.192
There's a story
about the Emperor Tiberius.

06:01.278 --> 06:05.156
He had enacted a law, which exacted
death for a certain crime...

06:05.323 --> 06:07.533
...unless the offender was a virgin.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.620
Now, when a virgin eventually
appeared on the charge...

06:12.164 --> 06:14.457
...the emperor didn't know exactly
how to proceed.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.960
So one of his council proposed
the perfect solution:

06:18.128 --> 06:22.631
Let her first be deflowered
so she then can be...

06:22.799 --> 06:24.216
...devoured.

06:25.635 --> 06:26.969
There are some...

06:27.137 --> 06:29.764
...and, no, l won't name them...

06:29.931 --> 06:32.349
...who first procure you
for the coronation...

06:32.517 --> 06:35.853
...next to preach at it,
and then to write books defending it.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.813
Thus they deflower you...

06:37.981 --> 06:42.985
...and will not fail soon afterwards
to devour you.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.866
But they shall never deflower me.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.317
That was beautiful.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.867
Do you play?

07:37.207 --> 07:39.041
All the time.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.934
-Majesty.
-Lady Eleanor.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.712
Yeah, well, you can take a look.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.466
Never mind.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.510
More like this. Watch.

08:32.387 --> 08:33.846
Fingers like so.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.140
Don't squeeze the arrow.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.475
Draw...

08:39.269 --> 08:40.936
...and release.

08:42.814 --> 08:45.024
I'll never do that.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.317
Yes, you will.

08:46.484 --> 08:49.069
Your Grace, l have him.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.322
Mr. Secretary.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.449
Your Grace.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.493
And your son.

08:56.661 --> 09:00.456
Yes. l'm teaching him how to sport
before l get too old for it.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.541
Do you shoot, Cromwell?

09:02.709 --> 09:03.792
Sometimes, Your Grace.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.261
My lord.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.028
Shall we walk?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.157
What does the king want?

09:35.617 --> 09:39.703
His Majesty would like to see you
back at court with your wife.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.455
He misses Your Grace's company.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.165
And?

09:44.709 --> 09:48.504
His Majesty is aware
that you favour the imperialist cause.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.215
You say so openly in council...

09:51.383 --> 09:54.677
...and have, perhaps, a great
sympathy for the dowager princess.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.428
Don't you?

09:57.264 --> 09:59.223
Actually, I do.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.767
I'm not heartless...

10:01.935 --> 10:04.186
...whatever some people think.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.730
Quite the contrary.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.775
But l serve the king.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.654
His Majesty intends
to vest the succession...

10:13.822 --> 10:16.991
...with the children he will have
with Queen Anne.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.494
A bill will go before Parliament.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.498
He wants to know
if he'll have your support.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.719
-She's hungry.
-Hey.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.228
Hey.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.523
What are you doing?

10:49.691 --> 10:51.525
Your Majesty.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.902
May I not feed her
from my own breast?

10:55.238 --> 10:57.031
Queens don't do that...

10:57.198 --> 10:59.408
...especially not for a daughter.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.119
Give her back to her wet nurse.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.925
The princess will shortly be given
her own establishment at Hatfield.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.929
Among others, the Lady Mary
will attend and wait on her.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.766
Catherine's daughter?

11:24.851 --> 11:26.310
Yes.

11:26.478 --> 11:29.229
It is well that she knows
her new place.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.067
Secretary Cromwell is arranging it.

11:37.405 --> 11:40.115
I will still give you a son.

11:43.453 --> 11:48.248
Come soon, my darling,
to my hot bed.

11:53.671 --> 11:57.091
-Ladies.
-Majesty.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.557
Alice, children?

12:07.894 --> 12:10.479
My dear family,
I have something to say to you.

12:11.773 --> 12:15.818
My income is now
so greatly reduced...

12:17.237 --> 12:20.739
...that we can no longer go on living
as we are accustomed.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.993
I am no longer the recipient
of the king's bounty...

12:25.161 --> 12:29.498
...and so I must live frugally...

12:30.834 --> 12:33.502
...and reduce my household.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.131
Those of you who can
must live in your own houses...

12:37.298 --> 12:39.133
...and eat at your own tables.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.342
It will be okay.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.511
-But, Father--
-No. Come on.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.765
Things inevitably must change.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.643
You can't all be supported forever.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.646
Life is not like that.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.774
Real life is raw...

12:57.360 --> 12:59.319
...and difficult.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.530
And you must face up to that fact.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.700
If not to even worse things.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.370
-Come on, eat up.
-What does Father mean?

13:08.538 --> 13:10.747
Eat your food while it's hot.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.379
Would you pour the wine, please?
Thank you.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.131
Yes, Mother More.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.730
The Lady Mary, Lady Bryan.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.900
Lady Mary.

13:38.401 --> 13:41.445
Welcome to Hatfield,
your new home.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.072
I am Lady Margaret Bryan,
the princess's governess.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.909
These other ladies are also here
to attend the princess...

13:47.076 --> 13:48.911
...as, of course, are you.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.080
Lady Mary, may l present you
to Her Highness...

13:52.248 --> 13:53.582
...the Princess Elizabeth.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.672
You will be shown to your room.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.426
You will begin your duties
in the mornings, after prayers.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.929
I shall say my prayers alone.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.807
This is your room, milady.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.626
Christmas.

15:20.795 --> 15:24.423
Well, why is it, as you get older,
it always seems to be Christmas?

15:24.591 --> 15:27.634
Of course, it is always Christmas
for you, isn't it, my lord?

15:27.802 --> 15:31.346
A baron in your own right now
and some new titles. Remind me?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.266
Master of Buckhounds.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.810
Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.937
Was there not another one?

15:39.105 --> 15:41.356
Master of the Bedlam
Hospital for the Insane?

15:42.525 --> 15:44.318
Yes.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.445
Do you plan to visit it?

15:46.613 --> 15:49.448
I don't mean as an inmate.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.953
I read one of your satires
about life here at court.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.831
If l were you, I'd be more careful
about poking fun...

15:57.999 --> 15:59.958
...at those who have the power
to hurt you.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.338
That's just friendly advice.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.730
Here, my love.

16:21.898 --> 16:25.692
I have a gift for you.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.907
It's fantastic.

16:32.075 --> 16:35.577
-Who made this?
-Master Holbein.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.122
The man's a genius.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.249
As are you...

16:41.417 --> 16:43.543
...my beautiful queen.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.384
Happy Christmas.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.304
I could still do it.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.932
I could find a way to poison her.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.308
No.

16:58.476 --> 17:02.020
-l thought that was what you wanted--
-lt would be blamed on my master.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.606
At the moment,
he doesn't need that.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.942
He has a war with the Turks
to contend with.

17:07.110 --> 17:10.112
-But why should anyone ever know?
-Don't be stupid, Brereton.

17:10.988 --> 17:14.658
They would find you and torture you,
and you would tell them everything.

17:14.826 --> 17:15.951
No, I wouldn't.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.120
I'd die a martyr's death.

17:20.581 --> 17:23.834
You have never seen a man
being tortured.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.586
Now, do you understand?

17:26.754 --> 17:28.964
You don't act alone.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.976
Charles.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.731
-Happy Christmas.
-And to Your Majesty.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.692
-l have a gift for you.
-Where is it?

17:48.860 --> 17:51.486
You'll have to wait till
the new session of Parliament...

17:52.029 --> 17:53.780
...for it's my vote.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.993
How could I have ever doubted you?

18:15.887 --> 18:17.053
Eleanor Luke.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.681
You see the way the king
looks at her?

18:20.433 --> 18:22.350
She's his mistress.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.395
Get rid of her.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.613
-Mary.
-Majesty.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.200
We must find you a new husband.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.209
I have another gift for you.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.296
I am with child again.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.400
Your Majesty, councillors...

19:12.568 --> 19:15.320
...here is the new act,
The Act of Succession...

19:15.488 --> 19:19.199
...which I am commanded to present
shortly to the Houses of Parliament.

19:19.367 --> 19:23.578
The act nominates the children born
of His Majesty and Queen Anne...

19:23.746 --> 19:25.413
...as first rightful heirs.

19:25.581 --> 19:29.751
It protects this nation from the great
divisions it has suffered in the past...

19:29.919 --> 19:32.796
...when several different titles
have pretended to the throne.

19:34.340 --> 19:39.261
The act warns that anyone saying
or writing anything to the prejudice...

19:39.428 --> 19:42.639
...or slander of the lawful matrimony
between the king...

19:42.807 --> 19:45.725
...and his most dear and entirely
beloved wife, Queen Anne...

19:45.893 --> 19:50.647
...or against his heirs,
would be guilty of high treason...

19:50.815 --> 19:52.774
...for which the penalty is death...

19:53.651 --> 19:57.279
...and forfeiture of goods
to the crown.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.782
"The new act requires
all the king's subjects...

20:00.950 --> 20:04.119
...if so commanded,
to swear an oath...

20:04.287 --> 20:06.580
...that they shall truly,
firmly, constantly...

20:06.747 --> 20:09.916
...without fraud and guile,
observe, fulfil, maintain, defend...

20:10.084 --> 20:14.129
...and keep the whole contents
and effect of the bill."

20:14.755 --> 20:19.092
This oath will also require recognition
of the king's supremacy...

20:19.260 --> 20:22.929
...in all matters,
spiritual and temporal.

20:23.097 --> 20:28.226
Those who refuse to take it
will be accounted guilty of treason...

20:28.686 --> 20:30.770
...and sent to prison.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.359
That is all well done, Mr. Secretary.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.321
I am pleased.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.992
So it must be sworn by oath after all.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.706
God save us.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.613
Does the king remain obdurate?

21:21.781 --> 21:23.198
Yes, Holy Father.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.116
He refuses to listen to advice.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.995
And he forces all true believers
to perjure their immortal souls.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.455
How so?

21:30.623 --> 21:34.834
They must all swear an oath that the
king is head of the English Church.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.712
Those who refuse are put in prison.

21:37.880 --> 21:41.216
Like our brother in Christ,
Bishop Fisher.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.051
Yes, Holy Father.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.929
This is unacceptable.

21:46.097 --> 21:50.225
The shepherd cannot stand idly by
while the wolf enters the fold...

21:50.393 --> 21:52.894
...and threatens his flock.

21:55.189 --> 21:58.400
I have decided to make Fisher
a cardinal.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.444
You will send his hat to England.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.905
Let's see if the king
is still prepared...

22:04.073 --> 22:08.076
...to prosecute and torture
a Prince of the Church.

22:23.259 --> 22:26.386
-Freshen those horses.
-Yes, sir.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.848
Take them to the stables.

22:35.312 --> 22:36.730
Mistress Bryan.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.857
-A very good morning to you.
-Your Majesty.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.900
I'm on progress.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.111
I've come to see my daughter.
How is she?

22:43.279 --> 22:46.781
She is a credit to Your Majesty
in every way.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.665
My Elizabeth.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.588
Who knows, Mistress Bryan...

23:01.756 --> 23:05.383
...perhaps one day, this little girl
will preside over empires.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.307
Please forgive me.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.809
I don't have much time.

23:32.369 --> 23:35.497
Thank you for all your care
toward our beloved princess.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.874
Your Majesty.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.548
What do you mean?

24:26.966 --> 24:28.633
More exercise for us, l fear.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.051
Lady Eleanor.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.887
-My lord.
-My lord.

24:35.516 --> 24:38.059
How did you suppose
no one would find out your secret?

24:39.311 --> 24:41.187
-l--
-Your chamber was searched today.

24:42.356 --> 24:43.398
My lord?

24:43.816 --> 24:45.608
The jewels were found.

24:45.776 --> 24:47.443
You did not hide them well enough.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.363
-Jewels, l don't--
-Her Majesty's jewels.

24:50.531 --> 24:52.490
The ones you stole.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.535
-lt's not true.
-And I say it is true.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.413
And if your crimes
were ever reported...

24:59.039 --> 25:01.457
...who do you suppose
would believe you?

25:02.960 --> 25:04.586
After all...

25:04.753 --> 25:06.754
...Lady Eleanor...

25:06.922 --> 25:09.591
...no one could accuse you
of being innocent...

25:09.758 --> 25:11.259
...could they?

25:14.763 --> 25:16.764
What am I to do?

25:17.141 --> 25:18.975
Leave court.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.519
Go back to your family.

25:22.104 --> 25:24.230
See if they will have you.

25:40.706 --> 25:44.417
"When her loose gown
From her shoulders did fall

25:46.086 --> 25:50.215
And she caught me in her arms
Long and small

25:51.634 --> 25:55.178
And therewithal sweetly
Did me kiss

26:01.352 --> 26:06.648
And softly said,
'Dear heart, how like you this?"'

26:06.815 --> 26:08.983
Cousin Madge.

26:09.151 --> 26:11.778
Lady Sheldon,
what are you reading?

26:11.946 --> 26:12.987
Nothing, my lady.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.657
Just some poetry.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.159
By Sir Thomas Wyatt.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.330
Give it here.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.672
You should not be wasting your time
on such trifles.

26:30.839 --> 26:34.050
If you must read when you
are supposed to be attending on me...

26:34.218 --> 26:36.302
...then you should read that book.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.680
You will learn a great deal
more from it...

26:38.847 --> 26:40.848
...perhaps even some wisdom.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.184
Yes, madam.

26:44.395 --> 26:45.812
Now go about your business.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.994
The Earl of Wiltshire, Your Majesty.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.832
Papa.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.584
Your Majesty.

27:10.504 --> 27:12.380
You look well.

27:12.548 --> 27:15.133
And l believe
you're already showing.

27:15.676 --> 27:17.385
A little.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.053
How was your trip to Paris?

27:20.347 --> 27:24.726
It was-- King Francis
is not the easiest man to deal with.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.394
He sends you wedding presents...

27:26.562 --> 27:29.564
...yet he pretends he cannot
officially recognise you as queen...

27:29.732 --> 27:32.650
...as long as Catherine remains alive.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.279
How is the king?

27:36.447 --> 27:38.823
He must be pleased
at your condition.

27:39.241 --> 27:40.867
He is.

27:41.744 --> 27:43.453
But...?

27:44.663 --> 27:47.081
Everything is fine.

27:50.085 --> 27:54.422
But when l was last with child,
the king took a mistress.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.341
And now--

27:57.134 --> 27:59.344
Now I fear he will take another...

28:00.095 --> 28:02.764
...since l must be careful
for the sake of the child...

28:02.931 --> 28:06.184
...and not let him enjoy
his conjugal rights.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.645
It is natural for a man...

28:09.813 --> 28:13.941
...when his wife is big with child
and not willing to lie with him...

28:14.109 --> 28:18.112
...to find some temporary consolation
elsewhere.

28:18.280 --> 28:22.116
And for kings,
it is properly expected.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.287
Sweetheart, listen to me.

28:26.455 --> 28:30.583
The danger to you and to us
is not that the king takes a mistress...

28:31.085 --> 28:34.087
...but that he takes the wrong one.

28:34.797 --> 28:39.550
Someone we can't control
or who would seek to control the king.

28:42.137 --> 28:46.641
But if you suppose the king is sure
to take a mistress...

28:47.434 --> 28:52.480
...then make sure
she is your choice...

28:52.940 --> 28:54.982
...and not his.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.491
I must make my report to the king.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.660
I'll see you later.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.184
All right, sir.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.191
-Mr. Secretary.
-Reverend Fisher.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.987
I just came to see
if you were being well treated.

29:41.655 --> 29:44.866
Oh, as to that, my aged stomach...

29:45.033 --> 29:48.578
...cannot cope with the rank food
the jailor brings.

29:48.745 --> 29:52.165
But that is nothing since it pertains
to my body and not my soul.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.761
You have not taken the oath.

30:06.388 --> 30:07.889
No.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.891
Why not?

30:10.225 --> 30:14.187
Do you refuse to accept that the
king's marriage is proper and legal?

30:15.481 --> 30:18.065
I believe His Majesty thinks it so.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.234
But you don't?

30:21.028 --> 30:22.528
No.

30:22.905 --> 30:25.406
I believe
what I have always believed.

30:25.741 --> 30:28.451
The king's marriage
to Queen Catherine is still valid...

30:28.619 --> 30:34.207
...and can be undone by no man,
not even Archbishop Cranmer.

30:42.758 --> 30:44.258
And do you dispute...

30:44.426 --> 30:47.094
...that the king is supreme head
of the Church in England?

30:47.596 --> 30:50.223
Yes, l do. Most emphatically.

30:50.432 --> 30:53.434
The king, our Sovereign Lord,
is not the supreme head on Earth...

30:53.602 --> 30:55.436
...of the Church of England.

31:00.234 --> 31:01.692
Tell me...

31:01.860 --> 31:04.904
...how is Sir Thomas More?

31:15.374 --> 31:16.999
Jailor!

31:19.878 --> 31:21.462
I will...

31:22.339 --> 31:25.466
...see if the quality of your food
can be improved.

31:27.344 --> 31:28.803
Thank you.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.982
Why did you get rid
of Lady Eleanor?

31:43.026 --> 31:45.152
She stole something precious
from me.

31:46.780 --> 31:48.114
Are you sure she stole it?

31:48.282 --> 31:49.907
Yes.

31:50.075 --> 31:52.827
I had the evidence. l had no choice.

31:56.665 --> 32:00.126
I hope Your Majesty
is not too disappointed?

32:01.670 --> 32:03.254
No.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.966
In any case...

32:07.843 --> 32:09.510
...l have something for you.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.183
Your Majesty.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.499
Elizabeth.

32:57.726 --> 32:59.226
Thank you.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.451
What's this?

33:15.911 --> 33:19.830
Majesty, there are a number
of small monastic institutions...

33:19.998 --> 33:21.666
...l have had cause to investigate.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.919
The monks there refuse
to take the oath.

33:25.087 --> 33:28.005
They'd rather serve
the vicar of Rome than you.

33:28.882 --> 33:31.258
This is a bill for their dissolution.

33:31.426 --> 33:34.428
The very considerable wealth
of these houses...

33:34.596 --> 33:38.224
...would thus be transferred
to Your Majesty's exchequer.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.365
Well?

33:55.992 --> 33:58.077
Majesty, I have just heard...

33:58.245 --> 34:01.288
...that the pope intends
to make Reverend Fisher a cardinal.

34:04.793 --> 34:08.254
Apparently, he has already dispatched
a cardinal's hat.

34:08.505 --> 34:11.340
Then Fisher will have to wear it
upon his shoulders.

34:11.508 --> 34:15.136
For, by the time it gets here,
he won't have a head to put it on.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.640
And what of More?

34:21.017 --> 34:22.143
I want to know.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.562
Will he take the oath?

34:27.733 --> 34:29.191
How is she? Does she feed well?

34:29.359 --> 34:31.152
She's good in every way,
Your Majesty.

34:31.319 --> 34:34.822
And hardly cries at all, as if she
already knows that she is a princess.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.660
I love you, Elizabeth.

34:40.829 --> 34:45.916
I love you with all my heart
and l bid you never forget it.

34:52.966 --> 34:54.925
Your Majesty.

34:58.305 --> 35:00.931
Before I leave, I wish to say something
to the Lady Mary.

35:14.696 --> 35:16.697
Lady Mary.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.788
Lady Mary, I am here in kindness.

35:24.873 --> 35:28.876
I would welcome you back to court
and reconcile you with your father...

35:29.044 --> 35:32.046
...if you will only accept me
as queen.

35:38.094 --> 35:40.679
I recognise no queen but my mother.

35:43.266 --> 35:45.559
But if the king's mistress...

35:45.727 --> 35:48.729
...would intercede with the king
on my behalf...

35:49.022 --> 35:50.981
...then l would be grateful.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.919
Sir Thomas More.

36:12.212 --> 36:13.379
Sir Thomas.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.256
Mr. Secretary.

36:16.049 --> 36:17.424
Please be seated.

36:17.592 --> 36:20.594
This is but an informal occasion.

36:20.762 --> 36:22.263
A little ale, perhaps?

36:22.639 --> 36:24.431
No, thank you.

36:38.488 --> 36:42.825
I'm sure we both know the object
which has brought us together.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.619
It is very widely rumoured,
Sir Thomas...

36:45.787 --> 36:49.123
...that you will refuse
to take the oath of succession.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.419
Now, l say this to you
very openly and sincerely...

36:53.587 --> 36:56.088
...that l wish no harm
to come to a great man...

36:56.256 --> 36:58.257
...who has for years enjoyed
and deserved...

36:58.425 --> 37:00.551
...His Majesty's good graces.

37:00.719 --> 37:04.471
I would rather lose my own son
than to see any hurt come to you.

37:06.641 --> 37:09.977
May I ask your opinion
of the king's new marriage?

37:11.104 --> 37:13.147
I have no opinion.

37:14.274 --> 37:17.818
I neither murmur at it
nor dispute upon it.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.653
I never did.

37:20.447 --> 37:21.488
Never will.

37:21.990 --> 37:24.825
Then what of His Majesty's claim
to supremacy...

37:24.993 --> 37:27.328
...over the Church in England?

37:30.081 --> 37:33.584
I was unsure about this matter...

37:34.628 --> 37:37.296
...until l reread
His Majesty's own pamphlet:

37:37.464 --> 37:39.506
The Assertio Septem
Sacramentorum.

37:41.051 --> 37:43.469
In fact, l have....

37:44.095 --> 37:46.180
I have a copy of it here.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.015
Of course, in the pamphlet...

37:48.183 --> 37:51.560
...the king asserts the divine origin
of the papacy.

37:51.728 --> 37:55.940
The pope's supremacy descends
directly from the rock of St. Peter.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.861
I think you'll find His Majesty's
arguments are as persuasive...

38:01.029 --> 38:04.031
...and powerful now as they were
when he first wrote them.

38:11.414 --> 38:13.040
Will you take the oath?

38:14.709 --> 38:18.379
I need hardly remind you
of the consequences of not doing so.

38:19.339 --> 38:24.385
Mr. Secretary,
I am the king's loyal subject.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.012
I say no harm...

38:27.389 --> 38:32.059
...l think no harm,
but I wish everybody good.

38:32.894 --> 38:36.939
And if this be not enough
to keep a man alive in good faith...

38:37.107 --> 38:38.732
...l long not to live.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.317
Sir Thomas.

38:40.777 --> 38:44.488
You should know that the king himself
has no mind to coerce you.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.741
He simply asks you to relent...

38:47.909 --> 38:52.246
...and condescend to his request
that you take the oath.

38:54.290 --> 38:58.377
Mr. Cromwell, please impart
to the king my utter faithfulness...

38:58.545 --> 39:02.256
...truthfulness and loyalty to him.

39:19.065 --> 39:22.443
Lord Farthington is most witty
and most fair.

39:22.610 --> 39:23.652
He is indeed.

39:23.820 --> 39:24.945
I cannot help myself.

39:25.113 --> 39:28.449
-And I noticed he has eyes for you.
-Oh, you know his hand belongs....

39:31.786 --> 39:33.996
What l wouldn't give to marry him.

39:34.164 --> 39:36.248
I agree.

39:49.179 --> 39:50.262
Cousin Madge.

39:51.598 --> 39:52.806
Yes, madam?

39:54.309 --> 39:56.310
Come and talk to me.

40:09.324 --> 40:13.077
I suppose you have many admirers.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.245
Yes.

40:15.663 --> 40:18.749
But l always remember
what Your Majesty told us...

40:18.917 --> 40:21.835
...about not being lewd
and setting a standard.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.923
I'm sure you do.

40:28.343 --> 40:33.263
But would it surprise you to learn
that one of your admirers is the king?

40:36.976 --> 40:39.728
-lt's not true.
-lt is true.

40:45.485 --> 40:48.195
Now, would it surprise you
even more...

40:48.363 --> 40:51.198
...if I told you
that you would have my blessing...

40:51.366 --> 40:53.158
...to become his mistress?

40:56.412 --> 40:58.705
-Madam?
-While I am with child...

40:58.873 --> 41:02.793
...His Majesty needs to be able
to lie with another woman.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.546
He is a passionate man.

41:07.048 --> 41:09.550
But she must be someone
I can trust.

41:09.717 --> 41:13.679
Whose family I can trust, like yours.

41:14.889 --> 41:18.892
After all, we are family.

41:19.853 --> 41:21.353
And you are reformers.

41:21.688 --> 41:25.065
Yes, Your Majesty.
We all gladly took the oath.

41:26.234 --> 41:30.237
Now will you gladly take the king
to your bed?

41:35.368 --> 41:38.579
His Excellence,
the imperial ambassador.

41:41.708 --> 41:43.542
-Excellency.
-Your Majesty...

41:44.085 --> 41:46.920
...forgive me but I come here
upon a mission of mercy.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.424
-Mercy?
-Very much so.

41:50.592 --> 41:53.594
Your daughter, the Lady Mary,
has fallen ill...

41:54.345 --> 41:56.972
...even to the concern
of her doctors.

41:57.432 --> 42:01.101
I have a letter written by her mother.

42:01.269 --> 42:03.937
She would like to nurse her child.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.397
She writes--

42:06.065 --> 42:07.691
If l may?

42:13.239 --> 42:17.576
"A little comfort and mirth with me
would be a half health to her.

42:19.120 --> 42:23.707
I could care for her with my own hands
and put her in my own bed...

42:23.917 --> 42:26.627
...and watch with her when needful."

42:35.470 --> 42:38.889
I will send my personal physician
to examine and help her.

42:39.098 --> 42:42.768
But l cannot allow Mary
and her mother to be together.

42:43.228 --> 42:47.522
But, Your Majesty, it is just the cry
of any mother for any daughter.

42:47.690 --> 42:48.857
But that's just it.

42:49.025 --> 42:51.276
They are not just any mother
or daughter.

42:52.320 --> 42:55.989
Do you not suppose they
would conspire to plot against me?

42:56.532 --> 42:59.159
-l cannot believe it.
-Of course you can believe it.

42:59.327 --> 43:00.869
You know it happens.

43:01.037 --> 43:04.915
And that sometimes illness
is used for political purpose.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.542
Do you not believe that Catherine
wants Mary...

43:07.710 --> 43:09.169
...to be queen above all else?

43:11.005 --> 43:12.506
Mr. Chapuys...

43:13.007 --> 43:16.051
...Lady Catherine is a very proud,
stubborn woman...

43:16.219 --> 43:18.887
...of very great and high courage.

43:19.055 --> 43:21.515
She could muster an army,
take the field...

43:21.683 --> 43:23.141
...and wage a war against me...

43:23.309 --> 43:26.186
...as fierce as any her mother, Isabella,
ever waged in Spain.

43:30.566 --> 43:32.526
Is that not true?

43:38.032 --> 43:41.868
I've been handed a summons
to appear at Lambeth Palace...

43:42.704 --> 43:44.538
...to take the oath.

43:45.873 --> 43:48.041
And l imagine l shall be imprisoned
afterwards.

43:48.209 --> 43:50.335
-No.
-Father.

43:51.004 --> 43:53.297
You must be good to each other...

43:54.340 --> 43:56.341
...and to everyone else.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.887
Or if you cannot be good...

44:02.307 --> 44:04.808
...be the least bad you can be.

44:35.089 --> 44:36.923
No, darling, no.

44:40.428 --> 44:42.095
Father.

45:09.957 --> 45:11.708
Lady Sheldon.

45:11.959 --> 45:13.335
Where's the queen?

45:13.503 --> 45:16.713
Your Majesty,
the queen is feeling indisposed...

45:16.881 --> 45:19.633
...and asks you to forgive her
not riding this morning.

45:22.637 --> 45:24.179
Of course.

45:24.722 --> 45:26.348
She--

45:26.849 --> 45:30.310
She wondered if Your Majesty
would be pleased...

45:30.728 --> 45:32.854
...if I took her place.

45:33.022 --> 45:34.147
Riding, I mean.

45:37.902 --> 45:39.986
If the queen gives her permission...

45:40.154 --> 45:41.571
...then why not?

45:41.739 --> 45:43.448
Lady Sheldon.

46:52.185 --> 46:54.561
You there. Down there.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.732
What's your name, Lady Sheldon?

46:58.900 --> 47:00.692
Margaret, Your Majesty.

47:00.860 --> 47:04.404
Though people call me Madge.

47:05.198 --> 47:08.575
Then l shall call you Madge,
if you'll allow me.

47:08.743 --> 47:11.077
Of course, Your Majesty.

47:36.812 --> 47:38.647
Sir Thomas?

47:40.066 --> 47:42.526
Are you now ready
to swear the oath?

47:43.819 --> 47:44.903
May I see it?

47:54.956 --> 47:56.289
Thank you.

48:02.672 --> 48:03.964
Well?

48:08.594 --> 48:11.137
I don't mean to put at fault this oath
or its makers...

48:11.305 --> 48:13.640
...or any man who swears to it.

48:13.808 --> 48:16.643
And l will never condemn
the conscience of any other man.

48:18.854 --> 48:20.981
But for myself, in good faith...

48:21.148 --> 48:22.816
...my own conscience
so moves me...

48:22.984 --> 48:25.777
...that l will swear
to the validity of the succession...

48:25.945 --> 48:27.737
...yet not the rest of it...

48:28.573 --> 48:32.659
...without jeopardising my soul
to perpetual damnation.

48:32.827 --> 48:35.495
We are very sorry
to hear you say this.

48:35.830 --> 48:37.664
You're almost the first to refuse it...

48:37.832 --> 48:40.250
...and your refusal
will cause the King's Highness...

48:40.418 --> 48:44.421
...to be both indignant
and suspicious of you.

48:44.589 --> 48:47.173
Here are all the members
of the Commons and the Lords...

48:47.341 --> 48:48.967
...who have sworn to take the oath.

48:49.343 --> 48:52.679
-The clergy too.
-l myself cannot swear.

48:53.514 --> 48:55.682
But l do not blame any other man
who has sworn.

48:55.850 --> 48:58.893
Sir Thomas,
we have come to the conclusion...

48:59.061 --> 49:03.857
...that far from being a true
and loyal servant to His Majesty...

49:04.775 --> 49:07.319
...there never was a servant
so villainous...

49:07.486 --> 49:10.113
...so traitorous to his prince as you.

49:10.281 --> 49:12.866
If you refuse to take the oath...

49:13.034 --> 49:14.784
...not only will you be imprisoned...

49:14.952 --> 49:18.872
...but the most horrid things
imaginable will be done to you.

49:19.040 --> 49:21.875
My lords, these threats
are for children, not for me.

49:26.047 --> 49:29.924
Do you deny that you bullied
and persuaded the king...

49:30.301 --> 49:34.137
...against his conscience,
to write this pamphlet against Luther?

49:34.305 --> 49:35.680
Of course I deny it.

49:36.515 --> 49:38.642
In the first place,
I would never ask anyone...

49:38.809 --> 49:42.062
...be he ever so high or so low,
to act against his conscience.

49:42.229 --> 49:45.523
And secondly,
I remember it was His Majesty...

49:45.691 --> 49:49.402
...who persuaded me of the paramount
importance of the papacy.

49:52.239 --> 49:55.075
I ask you a final time...

49:55.785 --> 50:00.080
...before the awful penalties
are exacted upon you...

50:02.333 --> 50:04.042
...why will you not swear?

50:11.509 --> 50:13.343
Why will you not swear?

50:26.816 --> 50:28.608
Oh, Madge.

50:30.861 --> 50:32.612
-What?
-Madge.

50:33.906 --> 50:36.157
I don't know. lt's funny.

50:38.452 --> 50:40.453
Madge.

50:42.331 --> 50:44.791
I like your dimples when you laugh,
Madge.

50:50.131 --> 50:51.548
Madge?

50:52.133 --> 50:53.800
Your Majesty?

50:57.471 --> 50:58.596
Come here.

51:14.655 --> 51:16.489
Let me...

51:16.657 --> 51:19.242
...examine your dimples...

51:19.785 --> 51:22.328
...a little more closely.

51:26.917 --> 51:28.877
Sir Thomas?

51:29.670 --> 51:31.463
Thank you.

51:33.966 --> 51:36.634
Oh, and Your Highness
might like to know...

51:36.802 --> 51:40.513
...that the Reverend Fisher
is lodged in the room down below.

51:41.599 --> 51:43.600
Good day to you, sir.
