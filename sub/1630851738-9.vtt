WEBVTT

00:28.194 --> 00:29.529
This is our fight.

00:30.488 --> 00:31.322
We're Lockes.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.658
We need to be the ones to face Dodge,

00:33.742 --> 00:38.246
so I'm asking you to stay safe
and out of sight until we can end this.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.832
-But, Kins--
-Too many people got hurt.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.836
If something happened to any of you,
I'd never forgive myself.

01:04.814 --> 01:09.027
Kinsey, if you change your mind,
say the word, and we'll be there.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.612
In a heartbeat.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.323
Is it bad to say I'm a little relieved?

02:25.645 --> 02:26.563
Morning, Kinsey.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.697
Feel like we got
a little interrupted yesterday.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.119
It's frustrating,
this situation between us.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.582
I really thought you cared about me.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.876
What are you talking about?
You're not Gabe.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.420
That's not entirely true.

02:51.421 --> 02:55.550
It's gotta be hard to understand,
but you have no idea how good this feels.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.345
I want you by my side.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.098
I… I wanna share all of this
with you, Kinsey.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.311
What we had was special.

03:06.811 --> 03:07.645
No.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.356
What we had was a total lie.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.152
The feelings on my side were real.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.236
Stop.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.949
I didn't wanna force you into this.
I wanted you to choose it.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.286
It mattered to me.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.082
But now…

03:30.877 --> 03:32.837
now you know what I'm capable of.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.506
Look what happened to Jackie.

03:38.134 --> 03:41.221
Truth is, you really only have one choice.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.644
I will never choose to be with you

03:48.353 --> 03:49.604
or be like you.

03:52.106 --> 03:54.108
Fine, then I'll kill your mom.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.237
Yeah, Nina.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.531
And just to be clear, not turn her.

04:03.576 --> 04:04.744
I mean kill her.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.332
Well, maybe now you're not so sure, huh?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.754
Just think about
how crushing it would be for poor Bode

04:14.837 --> 04:16.965
to have lost both of his parents.

04:19.175 --> 04:22.595
Once you join me,
I'll leave the rest of your family alone.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.932
I'm supposed to trust you?

04:27.767 --> 04:28.935
You have my word.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.525
The only thing I want is you.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.655
It's a lot, I know. Take it in.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.699
I'll be back tomorrow, and…

04:44.367 --> 04:46.244
we can get this whole thing resolved.

04:49.831 --> 04:50.707
See ya.

04:59.841 --> 05:03.845
Hey, I'm sorry
that I've been a little distracted lately,

05:03.928 --> 05:07.265
but I've been making a lot of progress
in my research project on Matheson.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.267
-That's cool.
-Yeah.

05:09.350 --> 05:13.313
You know who keeps coming up a lot
in my reading is the Lockes.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.190
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.359
Their ancestors
have been in Matheson forever.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.403
They were here
before the Revolutionary War.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.822
And they were blacksmiths and locksmiths,

05:22.905 --> 05:25.533
and they made
these incredible ornate keys.

05:25.616 --> 05:26.701
Did you know that?

05:28.202 --> 05:32.040
I mean, I guess I kind of figured it out.

05:32.123 --> 05:35.710
They're called the Lockes.
They live in a place called Keyhouse.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.421
Has Bode ever mentioned finding any keys?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.883
Why are you so interested?

05:42.383 --> 05:44.260
There's this key
I've been trying to locate.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.764
It keeps coming up in my research.
It's called the Omega Key.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.434
-The Omega Key.
-Mm-hmm.

05:52.727 --> 05:56.522
An omega symbol looks like…

05:58.900 --> 05:59.859
that.

06:02.653 --> 06:06.157
You think you could ask Bode if he's seen
anything like that around the house?

06:07.825 --> 06:09.077
Could you do that for me?

06:11.662 --> 06:12.830
Sure, Dad.

06:13.915 --> 06:17.043
He was asking about the keys,
especially the Omega Key!

06:17.126 --> 06:18.628
What? Really?

06:19.253 --> 06:21.464
Yeah,
that's the one he wants.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.716
How does he know
about the Omega Key?

06:24.592 --> 06:25.927
I don't know.

06:27.261 --> 06:30.390
-Did he say omega specifically?
-Yes!

06:32.767 --> 06:34.769
You think my dad might be a demon?

06:34.852 --> 06:36.854
-Probably not.
-How do you know?

06:37.480 --> 06:40.441
Dodge manipulates people
into stealing keys for her.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.860
She did it to me and Sam

06:42.944 --> 06:45.446
and probably did it to your dad too.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.448
Demons can't take keys.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.159
He's got no idea
what kind of danger he's in.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.620
That's why
we have to protect our parents

06:52.703 --> 06:56.040
because they don't understand enough
to protect themselves.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.668
I'll get there soon as I can.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.504
In the meantime, keep an eye on him.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.638
-Kins, are you in there?

07:11.514 --> 07:12.765
Yeah, give me a minute.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.350
Okay, but, Kins, I--

07:14.434 --> 07:16.561
Bode, please! I just need a minute.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.770
Hey, wait up a second, bud.

07:59.854 --> 08:02.815
Um, I'm heading over to Jamie's.
I'll be back before dinner.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.942
I… I need to ask you something.

08:05.526 --> 08:10.114
When you were talking to Jamie,
you mentioned the omega symbol.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.241
What were you talking about?

08:14.452 --> 08:17.205
Oh, it's just a new game
that me and Jamie were playing.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.165
Uh, it has ancient symbols.

08:19.248 --> 08:22.543
You both sounded so serious
like… like you were worried.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.754
It's a very stressful game.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.466
Okay. See here? Omega symbols.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.260
Your dad drew all of these.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.721
How do you know it's him?

08:33.804 --> 08:35.473
Well, it's his yearbook.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.476
Also, Sam Lesser.

08:38.559 --> 08:42.605
He… He had a tattoo
of this exact same symbol on his wrist.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.065
Do you remember that?

08:44.148 --> 08:45.650
Uh, maybe.

08:45.733 --> 08:49.570
So you can see why I'm having a hard time
believing this is all just a coincidence.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.113
Sure.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.658
I don't know.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.954
You would tell me, wouldn't you?

08:58.538 --> 09:02.041
If there was something going on.
If you knew something.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.085
If I could, I would.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.254
I'm sorry.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.631
I love you. I just gotta go.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.560
Now you just need to stir it as it melts.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.729
How'd you learn how to do all this?

09:23.813 --> 09:27.275
Chamberlin taught us.
Though I think he grew to regret it.

09:31.404 --> 09:35.241
You know, Rendell,
he said that I was lucky.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.661
That I've been given a gift.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.540
It's hard for me to see it that way

09:42.623 --> 09:45.793
when the only two keys I've made
have caused so much pain.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.801
I hope it'll be different for you.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.181
It will be.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.517
We're gonna bring Jackie back.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.857
-How's it going in here?

10:07.940 --> 10:11.694
This needs to melt, pour it in the mold,
and then we have to wait for it to harden.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.362
Mmm. How long will that take?

10:14.405 --> 10:17.575
Every key is different.
Could be a couple minutes, a couple hours.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.535
You'll be finished by tonight, right?

10:21.912 --> 10:23.122
What's the matter?

10:23.914 --> 10:25.374
Gabe showed up at Keyhouse.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.004
And?

10:32.006 --> 10:34.884
He told me he's gonna kill Mom
if I don't agree to turn.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.265
It'll be all right.
It's never gonna get that far.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.392
There's no way to totally protect her.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.646
-I can't let that happen.
-You're not gonna turn.

10:46.729 --> 10:50.066
I'm not gonna let him kill Mom.
He went after Jackie because of me.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.317
No. No, no.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.862
-That wasn't your fault.
-Wasn't it?

10:54.945 --> 10:56.822
If we're being totally honest here.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.949
Don't even think like that, Kinsey.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.497
He gave me until tomorrow.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.713
She needs to coax it out of him.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.051
No.

11:18.761 --> 11:19.970
No, this is…

11:21.263 --> 11:23.974
This is wrong.
I would be lying to my daughter.

11:24.558 --> 11:28.479
How long have you been
looking for this portal, Josh?

11:28.562 --> 11:31.941
How much time have you spent
dreaming about it?

11:32.024 --> 11:34.777
No, I'm sorry. I, um… I can't do it.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.363
What if your wife
is on the other side?

11:38.614 --> 11:39.740
Don't.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.659
Don't use her to manipulate me.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.869
What if I take you to see it?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.122
The door?

11:46.789 --> 11:48.541
Then you can decide what to do.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.628
You're already so close.
Don't you just wanna see it?

11:54.505 --> 11:56.173
And what is that gonna cost me?

11:57.550 --> 11:58.509
Nothing.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.094
I promise.

12:04.807 --> 12:05.808
All right.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.518
Smart decision.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.354
We're gonna have to go soon. Tide's low.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.526
You're gonna need some better shoes
and a jacket. Okay?

12:15.609 --> 12:18.904
Okay, I'll go to my place.
I'll meet you in the courtyard.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.242
Oh!

12:25.786 --> 12:27.329
Bring two flashlights.

12:45.347 --> 12:48.809
Gabe. Eden and that history teacher,
they're up to something.

12:49.518 --> 12:50.603
Like what?

12:50.686 --> 12:53.606
I don't know.
They were in the common room.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.358
Looked like she was trying
to convince him to do something.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.486
Just kill the bitch.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.112
What?

13:00.196 --> 13:02.156
Kill her. Eden. Get rid of her.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.784
Who are you talking to?

13:04.867 --> 13:06.494
My good pal, Gabe?

13:06.577 --> 13:07.661
Let me say hi!

13:09.705 --> 13:11.582
Are you making Javi spy on me?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.667
What are you up to, Eden?

13:14.210 --> 13:16.420
Better not be something
you're gonna regret.

13:16.504 --> 13:20.341
I'm actually very busy,
so I'm gonna run. Okay?

13:20.424 --> 13:21.509
Bye-bye now.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.304
Why are you here, Javi?

13:26.889 --> 13:27.890
Hockey practice.

13:27.973 --> 13:32.144
Hmm. I'm pretty sure the rink
is on the opposite side of the campus.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.854
-I'll take that!

14:19.733 --> 14:20.985
Where are you going?

14:21.068 --> 14:24.822
Oh, the weather's turned around,
so I'm gonna go on a quick hike.

14:25.447 --> 14:26.532
Can I come?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.952
Well, honey,
I just need a little time to myself.

14:30.494 --> 14:31.412
Okay.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.330
But I won't be long,

14:33.414 --> 14:36.542
and Bernadette is in the front office
if you need anything, okay?

14:36.625 --> 14:37.459
Okay.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.169
-All right, bye.
-Bye.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.638
Ready to go?

14:51.015 --> 14:52.057
Are you bleeding?

14:54.852 --> 14:55.811
Yeah.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.689
I sometimes get random nose bleeds.

15:13.037 --> 15:13.996
Mom?

15:27.176 --> 15:28.177
You okay?

15:30.346 --> 15:31.221
Yeah.

15:32.848 --> 15:37.144
You ever feel like everyone's in on a joke
except you?

15:40.272 --> 15:41.190
Yeah.

15:43.859 --> 15:44.860
Um…

15:45.819 --> 15:47.404
Duncan said that

15:48.906 --> 15:50.658
you and Gabe broke up.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.410
You wanna talk about it?

15:54.745 --> 15:57.414
He just wasn't who I thought he was.

15:58.207 --> 16:02.044
Yeah, he was a nice kid, but I don't know.
There was always something off about him.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.672
Can I admit that now?

16:06.131 --> 16:08.175
Well, your instincts were right.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.973
Hey, I was thinking
we could cook something later.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.141
Maybe watch a movie?

16:17.851 --> 16:19.311
I'd even let you choose.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.066
Can I take a rain check?

16:26.110 --> 16:28.487
There's something
I have to do tonight, and, um…

16:28.570 --> 16:29.780
Maybe tomorrow?

16:32.825 --> 16:33.784
Sure.

16:35.744 --> 16:36.662
Tomorrow.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.212
Let me know
if you change your mind about tonight.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.131
I'll be here.

16:49.633 --> 16:50.634
Okay.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.137
Thanks, honey.

16:53.637 --> 16:54.638
Of course.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.768
What happened?

17:00.436 --> 17:03.105
My dad got his hiking gear
and left with Eden.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.858
Did they say where they were going?

17:05.941 --> 17:08.068
No, but he came in here first.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.821
He was digging around in his drawers,
over here.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.517
It's okay. He's gone.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.812
Why does your dad have this?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.064
What is it?

18:27.147 --> 18:30.400
I think it's the opening
behind the Black Door.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.197
Your dad went to the sea caves.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.242
Eden's taking him to the Black Door.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.163
We gotta go help him.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.166
How's that gonna work?

18:46.250 --> 18:47.376
We

18:48.794 --> 18:50.254
have the advantage.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.097
This next part is crucial.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.683
It requires deep concentration.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.521
A key gets its magic
from the intention of the key maker.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.231
Close your eyes…

19:11.150 --> 19:13.318
and focus on that intention.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.697
What do you need this key to do?

19:20.868 --> 19:23.370
The material that we're using
is from the demon world.

19:23.453 --> 19:26.540
But that doesn't mean
that its power can't be reshaped.

19:26.623 --> 19:31.003
The keys,
they can bring about the darkest evil

19:31.086 --> 19:34.506
or the greatest good.
And you, as the maker, get to decide.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.225
Okay.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.186
Now what?

19:50.230 --> 19:51.607
You add your blood.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.272
Scot. What are you doing here?

20:32.356 --> 20:35.817
Okay, look, I know what you said,
but I just--

20:37.903 --> 20:39.947
I can't not help you, Kinsey,

20:40.530 --> 20:44.451
and I made a list
of eight reasons as to why.

20:44.534 --> 20:47.996
Number one,
I'm quite nimble. Number--

20:52.334 --> 20:53.543
I know it's selfish of me,

20:53.627 --> 20:56.672
but I'm kinda glad
you didn't get into Rochester.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.008
I mean, they're still idiots
for not taking you.

21:01.176 --> 21:04.221
Yeah, well, I mean,
can't put all the blame on them.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.057
I actually did get in.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.977
But you were so excited.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.232
Oh my God. You didn't change your mind
'cause of what was happening here?

21:15.315 --> 21:16.775
No! No! No.

21:17.442 --> 21:21.238
No. I just had a feeling.
I didn't really feel up to it.

21:21.321 --> 21:24.574
You know, listen to your gut, right?

21:25.075 --> 21:26.493
Not when your gut is wrong.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.914
Scot, we all have self-doubts,
but you can't pass this up.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.500
I thought you were happy
that I'm here, hmm?

21:34.293 --> 21:36.253
Not at the expense of your dream.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.797
You have to do this.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.508
Call and tell them you changed your mind.

21:42.301 --> 21:46.054
-Well, I guess I could… try.

21:47.055 --> 21:49.308
-You just saw that, right?
-Yeah, I saw that.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.398
Stone cold.

21:56.481 --> 21:57.774
It's frozen.

21:57.858 --> 22:01.153
-You think someone's using a key?
-There's not a key like that.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.448
This weird, freezing stuff's
been happening to me all day.

22:04.531 --> 22:08.410
First, my tea went ice-cold,
then my bathroom mirror got frosted.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.412
I was starting to think
I was going insane.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.165
All right, well,
if… if it's not a key, then…

22:14.916 --> 22:16.752
maybe you got a ghost on your hands.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.754
-A ghost?
-Yeah.

22:18.837 --> 22:22.341
Ghosts are often associated
with creating cold spots.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.968
I mean, at least
according to paranormal lore.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.012
That sounds like total bullshit.

22:28.096 --> 22:31.725
Coming from the girl who's actually
hung out with her ghost relatives.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.687
Fair, but Chamberlin's never been
inside the house.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.440
Well, maybe he's trying
to tell you something.

22:39.399 --> 22:42.986
I'm being haunted by my demon ex-boyfriend
and my great-great-grandfather.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.321
Yeah.

22:44.988 --> 22:45.906
Awesome.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.702
So what's the big message?

22:53.413 --> 22:54.748
What do you wanna tell me?

22:58.752 --> 23:00.504
Kins, look.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.610
Whoa, whoa. Hey, Kins, I wouldn't do that.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.113
K-Kins?

23:26.613 --> 23:28.740
Kins, I really wouldn't.

23:29.908 --> 23:34.329
Hey, Kins, have you… have you ever seen
that really famous 1906 French silent film

23:34.413 --> 23:36.748
by one George Méliès
called The Chimney Sweep?

23:36.832 --> 23:37.666
No.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.377
Me neither, but I'm pretty sure
things didn't go well for him.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.337
Hey, Scot, can… can you stop talking?

23:42.421 --> 23:43.672
Yeah, right. Sorry.

23:52.389 --> 23:53.432
-Whoa.

23:56.059 --> 23:58.854
This must be what Chamberlin
or whoever wanted me to find.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.023
-What the hell is it?
-I don't know.

24:03.066 --> 24:04.067
But look.

24:31.928 --> 24:34.389
I wanna say
how grateful I am to you all.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.184
I really never thought
that I could get to this place.

24:38.435 --> 24:39.352
Thank you.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.480
Thank you, Gary.

24:44.232 --> 24:46.359
Oh, would anyone else like to share?

24:50.655 --> 24:52.240
Hi, I'm… I'm Nina.

24:53.241 --> 24:54.493
I'm an alcoholic.

24:54.576 --> 24:55.952
Hi, Nina.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.040
Um…

25:01.124 --> 25:03.502
Some of you probably know this
about me already,

25:03.585 --> 25:06.838
but my husband died last year,

25:08.048 --> 25:12.302
and I moved my kids here
to the house where he grew up.

25:14.679 --> 25:17.724
We all went through
a… a rough transition phase.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.354
I thought for a second
I would drag us all back to Seattle, but…

25:23.772 --> 25:26.316
I didn't 'cause the kids, they…

25:29.194 --> 25:30.403
they're doing great.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.823
They're really thriving here.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.576
And I'm glad.

25:38.161 --> 25:42.040
I mean, what mother
doesn't want that for her kids?

25:45.877 --> 25:50.215
And I figured once they were happy again,

25:51.216 --> 25:53.718
that I could start to move forward myself.

25:55.345 --> 25:59.099
I actually thought that it would
be easier for me, you know, 'cause…

25:59.182 --> 26:01.476
I'm an adult.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.646
I've got the wisdom of my years.

26:07.023 --> 26:10.986
I'm used to holding pain and joy
inside my heart.

26:16.658 --> 26:20.787
And I've been… I've been trying,
but there are just these things…

26:23.623 --> 26:26.793
I can't move on from things
that still make no sense to me.

26:26.876 --> 26:30.880
I don't understand
how Ellie Whedon disappeared,

26:32.007 --> 26:35.510
and I don't believe
that my friend Joe committed suicide.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.387
And this kid who killed my husband,

26:37.470 --> 26:41.266
if it was… if it was just some…
some random freak out like they say,

26:42.767 --> 26:47.647
then why did he follow us to Matheson
to try to finish us off? Why?

26:47.731 --> 26:50.275
And why am I the only one still asking?

26:50.358 --> 26:53.153
Why aren't my kids?
I don't understand how they…

26:57.365 --> 27:01.161
I want them to move on
and to be happy. I do.

27:07.334 --> 27:10.587
But it just makes me feel
like I'm completely on my own.

27:16.593 --> 27:17.844
I know that…

27:18.762 --> 27:22.390
…that alcoholism can be, um, isolating.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.270
But what I'm talking about, it's… it's…

27:28.688 --> 27:30.482
it's something more than that.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.450
Thank you for listening.

27:41.743 --> 27:42.994
Thank you, Nina.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.003
I appreciated you sharing.

27:52.087 --> 27:55.215
Oh yeah, I guess I just really needed
to get that out.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.842
Oh, I hope you didn't take any offense.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.970
I know you did everything you could
about Ellie and Joe.

28:01.054 --> 28:04.474
Don't even worry about it.
It was frustrating for me too.

28:05.975 --> 28:08.269
I'm just sorry
you're having such a difficult time.

28:10.605 --> 28:14.859
Would you be up
for grabbing a cup of coffee just to talk?

28:17.153 --> 28:18.279
Absolutely.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.281
-Here.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.586
This way.

28:49.185 --> 28:51.813
I can't believe
we're this close to Keyhouse.

28:52.605 --> 28:54.566
It was right under my nose.

28:58.695 --> 29:01.740
My ancestor
clearly didn't want anyone finding it.

29:02.949 --> 29:05.660
There's not one mention in his journal
of the sea cave.

29:06.536 --> 29:10.373
Your ancestor,
he was the first person to find the door?

29:12.083 --> 29:13.543
Uh, he didn't mention a door.

29:13.626 --> 29:18.298
He said that he found a portal,
and it opened for him.

29:21.634 --> 29:22.635
Wow.

29:23.845 --> 29:26.264
He must have been a really powerful dude.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.152
Chamberlin?

29:41.196 --> 29:43.531
I found the harness or whatever.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.035
Thank you. But…

29:48.870 --> 29:49.954
What does it do?

29:50.455 --> 29:52.165
Where's the key that goes with it?

29:58.797 --> 30:02.342
I wish I could literally talk to you,
but we don't have the Ghost Key anymore,

30:02.425 --> 30:04.803
so I'm gonna need a little more help.

30:41.881 --> 30:43.174
Whoa.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.719
Thank you, Chamberlin!

30:47.262 --> 30:49.097
Yeah, cheers! Wherever you are!

30:49.681 --> 30:51.140
So what do you think it does?

30:55.603 --> 30:57.397
I'm sorry I'm getting the credit.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.275
No, I don't need credit.
I'm glad it worked.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.365
Here, this way!

31:11.786 --> 31:13.204
I think it's ready.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.448
It worked.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.619
There's only one way to know for sure.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.191
It's real.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.155
The energy.

32:32.992 --> 32:35.495
It does not feel good.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.291
You feel the power, though, right?

32:41.459 --> 32:44.295
You can't fully experience it
until the doors open.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.756
Let's get the hell out of here.
Get the key.

32:47.882 --> 32:49.550
How do you know about this?

32:51.177 --> 32:52.261
Doesn't matter.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.062
Well, look at this.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.272
New alliances.

33:03.356 --> 33:06.484
Okay, what the hell's going on here?

33:07.902 --> 33:09.696
You wanna tell him, or should I?

33:14.325 --> 33:15.535
She's a demon,

33:16.160 --> 33:19.789
and she's trying to open this door
so you'll turn into one too.

33:22.792 --> 33:23.668
What?

33:24.210 --> 33:25.336
And why?

33:25.837 --> 33:29.007
So you can make your own demon army
to fight against me?

33:29.090 --> 33:31.926
Come on, Eden. That's sad, even for you.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.138
I've already killed your best lackey.
I can do much worse.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.058
You're gonna regret never respecting me.

33:41.227 --> 33:42.270
Actually…

33:44.522 --> 33:46.441
I think it's gonna be
the other way around.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.996
-Bye, Eden.

34:14.093 --> 34:15.928
-Use your flashlight on them!
-What?

34:49.504 --> 34:51.214
Oh shit!

35:00.181 --> 35:01.224
Shit!

35:04.685 --> 35:05.520
Uh-oh.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.688
The whole cave is collapsed.

35:09.982 --> 35:10.942
Dad!

35:11.901 --> 35:13.069
Dad!

35:14.695 --> 35:16.447
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

35:17.657 --> 35:18.616
Dad!

35:19.367 --> 35:20.201
Jamie?

35:20.785 --> 35:22.036
Dad, are you okay?

35:23.329 --> 35:24.622
Yeah, I'm okay.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.666
Can you go and get help, honey?

35:27.542 --> 35:28.626
We can do this.

35:33.881 --> 35:37.885
-We're gonna get you out of there.
-Okay. Who's with you?

35:50.022 --> 35:51.065
Hold on.

35:51.941 --> 35:52.900
Bode?

36:00.908 --> 36:02.743
Hey, uh, can you fit through this?

36:14.213 --> 36:15.214
Hey.

36:20.595 --> 36:21.596
You okay?

36:23.556 --> 36:25.975
Yeah. How did you do that?

36:26.058 --> 36:27.476
It doesn't matter.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.604
What happened to you in there?

36:31.272 --> 36:33.482
The… The shadows, they came to life,

36:33.566 --> 36:37.028
and they were gonna… they were gonna
tear the whole place down, and…

36:37.820 --> 36:39.572
and then you showed up, and…

36:40.198 --> 36:41.699
How did you know where I…

36:44.911 --> 36:45.912
Where, um…

36:49.040 --> 36:50.041
Dad?

36:52.501 --> 36:54.003
Yeah, sweetheart, what's up?

36:54.086 --> 36:56.672
You were just telling us something.

36:56.756 --> 36:57.840
Was I?

37:00.843 --> 37:02.386
How'd we get in this cave?

37:02.470 --> 37:04.347
Well, we were just exploring,

37:04.430 --> 37:07.099
and then some rocks came down,
and you bumped your head.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.644
Oh…

37:09.727 --> 37:12.647
Yeah, that would explain
why I'm so confused.

37:13.147 --> 37:14.357
Are you okay?

37:14.440 --> 37:17.526
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good.
I'm just glad we're all safe.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.947
We should probably get out of here.

37:22.281 --> 37:23.282
Come on.

37:39.173 --> 37:40.174
Tyler, look.

38:46.198 --> 38:48.200
I'll be here if you need me.

38:48.993 --> 38:49.910
Yeah.

38:50.661 --> 38:51.579
Thanks.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.070
Jackie.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.492
What are you doing here, Tyler?

40:13.619 --> 40:14.787
Did you miss me?

40:16.288 --> 40:17.248
Yeah,

40:18.624 --> 40:19.542
in a sense.

40:20.668 --> 40:21.794
Well, that's silly.

40:23.045 --> 40:24.088
I'm here.

40:25.464 --> 40:26.924
I'm still myself, you know.

40:28.467 --> 40:29.552
How's that?

40:30.678 --> 40:33.431
I remember
everything we've ever done.

40:35.766 --> 40:36.851
Every moment.

40:38.561 --> 40:41.480
Going into my head, traveling to Bath.

40:45.401 --> 40:46.944
Isn't that what you wanted?

40:51.782 --> 40:52.700
It is.

40:54.493 --> 40:56.203
So we can still be together.

40:58.664 --> 41:00.291
You just need to let me in.

41:02.418 --> 41:05.212
What does that mean exactly?

41:06.255 --> 41:09.800
It means letting go of any preconceptions.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.846
Embracing your impulses.

41:15.723 --> 41:17.224
Throwing away all your,

41:17.766 --> 41:21.145
"I need to be the Tyler everyone else
wants me to be," and just

41:22.438 --> 41:24.315
following your desires.

41:30.779 --> 41:32.990
We could be so happy together, Tyler.

41:35.826 --> 41:36.952
Don't you want that?

41:40.706 --> 41:42.791
Yeah, I do. I really do.

42:16.450 --> 42:17.368
Jackie?

42:23.874 --> 42:24.917
What is that?

42:30.047 --> 42:31.674
I want you to take it from me.

42:59.785 --> 43:01.245
I'm so sorry.

43:01.328 --> 43:03.163
You don't have anything to be sorry about.

43:03.247 --> 43:06.792
I didn't think anyone could save me,
but you did. Thank you.

43:07.668 --> 43:08.711
I love you, Jack.

43:09.545 --> 43:11.213
I love you too.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.018
Is something wrong?

43:26.520 --> 43:28.856
-I don't know.

43:30.649 --> 43:32.818
-You okay?

43:32.901 --> 43:33.861
Jackie!

43:35.070 --> 43:36.989
Jackie! Jackie!

43:37.072 --> 43:38.324
Jack!

43:38.407 --> 43:40.242
Jackie!

43:42.494 --> 43:43.495
Jackie!

43:44.663 --> 43:46.457
Jackie! Jack!

43:46.540 --> 43:47.791
-Jack--

43:50.127 --> 43:50.961
Jackie.

43:53.797 --> 43:54.715
Jack.

43:55.883 --> 43:58.052
Jackie? Jackie?

44:02.097 --> 44:03.098
Jackie?

44:05.851 --> 44:06.852
Jackie!

44:08.062 --> 44:09.063
Jackie!

44:11.690 --> 44:12.775
No.
