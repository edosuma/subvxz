00:55.012 --> 00:58.182
Love is drawn
in the form of a circle.

01:02.286 --> 01:04.355
No one knows where it begins...

01:06.356 --> 01:07.926
And it never really ends.

01:11.594 --> 01:12.897
You and I, we are...

01:14.665 --> 01:18.269
We are just... forever.

01:21.305 --> 01:25.843
Always... and all ways.

03:14.784 --> 03:17.420
<i>Sometimes
when you're not looking,</i>

03:17.454 --> 03:19.724
<i>I watch you
from across the room.</i>

03:24.127 --> 03:26.863
<i>And I ask myself,
if I didn't know you...</i>

03:28.064 --> 03:30.367
Would I still
fall in love with you?

03:31.467 --> 03:32.804
And what's the answer?

03:50.454 --> 03:52.490
Tate and Donna
are getting a divorce.

03:54.724 --> 03:56.026
Tate and Donna?

03:57.828 --> 03:59.430
They threw the party.

04:00.864 --> 04:04.402
Why throw a party if
you're getting a divorce?

04:04.435 --> 04:06.704
It's ending between them,
but it's not over.

04:08.472 --> 04:09.873
They seemed happy.

04:12.609 --> 04:15.713
- I really thought they were happy.
- Yeah.

05:45.935 --> 05:46.971
Come on, Charlie.

05:49.773 --> 05:52.076
Take daddy for a walk
when he gets up.

05:52.108 --> 05:53.478
See you later, Charlie.

06:08.759 --> 06:11.161
Charlie boy. Good morning.

06:11.194 --> 06:13.129
Good morning.
Let's go. Let's go.

06:29.612 --> 06:32.250
- Hekima, send that video to Zoe.
- <i>Done.</i>

06:34.651 --> 06:37.187
Let's go, Charlie. Let's go.

06:46.829 --> 06:48.097
Morning, Nick.

06:48.130 --> 06:50.233
- Morning, Marcus. Hi, Steph.
- Hi.

07:03.747 --> 07:05.915
<i>- Hello?
- Zoe, it's wonderful.</i>

07:05.949 --> 07:08.985
<i>I love this. Best sister ever.
Thank you so much.</i>

07:09.019 --> 07:11.155
<i>- Happy birthday!
- So thoughtful. Thank you.</i>

07:11.187 --> 07:13.656
<i>- Sibila picked it out.
- Oh, is she there?</i>

07:13.689 --> 07:15.725
<i>Yeah. You're on speaker.
She can hear you.</i>

07:15.759 --> 07:17.828
Thank you, sibila.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.300
<i>The guy at the shop
said it still works.</i>

07:24.334 --> 07:26.203
<i>I had him put
some batteries in it.</i>

07:28.939 --> 07:31.241
That's really nice.

07:31.274 --> 07:37.680
What did she say?

07:37.713 --> 07:40.350
<i>You and Janine should
come rock climbing with us.</i>

07:40.384 --> 07:42.720
Nah. Nah.

07:42.752 --> 07:45.055
I don't like doing things
where I could potentially...

07:45.088 --> 07:48.125
- <i>Have fun?</i>
- Get killed.

07:48.158 --> 07:52.930
The sad irony of dying
on or near my birthday is...

07:52.963 --> 07:56.867
- Hey, did you get that video I sent you?
- <i>What is it?</i>

07:56.899 --> 07:59.036
It's a birthday gift
from Janine.

07:59.069 --> 08:00.237
<i>What is it?</i>

08:01.805 --> 08:03.007
It's...

08:04.173 --> 08:06.943
It's my hand. It's imagery.

08:08.812 --> 08:10.348
Hands tell the story.

08:14.250 --> 08:17.320
- <i>Sibila says it's beautiful.</i>
- Sibila gets it.

08:17.353 --> 08:20.257
- <i>You should come rock climbing with us!</i>
- No.

08:21.391 --> 08:23.794
Listen, someday
if you guys want to go,

08:23.826 --> 08:26.797
I don't know, lawn bowling.

08:26.829 --> 08:28.931
Or you want to play
some doubles racquetball.

08:28.964 --> 08:31.000
- <i>You're no fun, Nick.</i>
- I know.

08:31.033 --> 08:34.105
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

08:34.937 --> 08:36.039
Thank you.

08:37.139 --> 08:38.875
Talk to you later, Zoe.

08:38.908 --> 08:40.211
<i>Bye. Love you.</i>

08:46.383 --> 08:48.918
What we want to accomplish
in our next pass

08:48.951 --> 08:53.190
is to make allowances for the
outcome of our planning stages.

08:53.222 --> 08:57.126
Have we taken into consideration
environmental impact?

08:57.159 --> 09:01.197
Have we really thought through the
cause and effect of our choices?

09:01.230 --> 09:03.900
Within a design itself,

09:03.933 --> 09:07.036
how are we allowing for
fluctuations in human density

09:07.070 --> 09:09.140
and changes in social grids?

09:09.974 --> 09:11.975
What's most important...

09:23.519 --> 09:25.355
- That was a bad one.
- Oh, god.

09:25.388 --> 09:27.508
- These fucking time shifts.
- I didn't feel anything.

09:28.258 --> 09:29.727
I need to call my wife.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.062
- Here.
- Everyone take a minute.

09:33.096 --> 09:35.264
Check in at home,
make sure everything's good.

09:39.336 --> 09:41.904
Hekima, call Janine.

09:46.475 --> 09:48.378
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Did you feel that?

09:48.410 --> 09:50.322
<i>A little something,
but it wasn't anything serious.</i>

09:50.346 --> 09:52.448
I'll run
through everything, okay?

09:52.481 --> 09:55.485
- What's your name?
- <i>Janine mikkelsen.</i>

09:55.519 --> 09:59.089
- Where do you live?
- <i>11 lantana Crescent Lane.</i>

09:59.121 --> 10:03.025
- Who are you married to?
- <i>I'm married to you, Nicholas Perry mikkelsen.</i>

10:03.058 --> 10:07.831
See? Nothing's changed. We're okay.
We're fine, we're still together.

10:07.864 --> 10:11.000
<i>You can't panic over every
little time shift, okay?</i>

10:12.369 --> 10:13.403
<i>Okay?</i>

10:17.841 --> 10:20.409
- You're right, okay.
- <i>Okay.</i>

10:20.442 --> 10:21.846
<i>I'll see you tonight.</i>

10:23.078 --> 10:25.415
- I love you.
- <i>I love you, too.</i>

11:02.719 --> 11:05.355
Look who it is. Hey, Charlie.

11:06.188 --> 11:08.324
Hey, buddy. You all right?

11:10.059 --> 11:11.427
Good kitty, Charlie.

11:55.004 --> 11:56.240
These are great.

11:56.273 --> 11:58.274
The choreography's amazing.

11:58.307 --> 12:01.410
<i>They just have this way</i>

12:01.443 --> 12:03.346
<i>of really physicalizing
the narrative.</i>

12:07.017 --> 12:08.986
<i>- It's an art piece?
- Oh gosh, yeah.</i>

12:09.019 --> 12:11.621
It's beautiful actually.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.158
<i>I think you'll love it.</i>

12:26.068 --> 12:27.403
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

12:48.591 --> 12:54.130
Your sister emailed. She said she
invited us to go rock climbing.

12:54.163 --> 12:56.600
- You want to go?
- Rock climbing?

12:56.633 --> 13:00.470
I mean... not rock climbing.
Just to hang out.

13:00.503 --> 13:04.307
- That's weird, don't you think?
- What?

13:04.341 --> 13:07.945
Sibila and Zoe. Having a best
friend who doesn't speak English.

13:09.111 --> 13:11.948
That's not weird.
It's different.

13:11.981 --> 13:14.217
- It's...
- Different doesn't make it weird.

13:15.518 --> 13:17.321
It's odd, no?

13:21.423 --> 13:23.192
- Okay.
- I love my sister,

13:23.225 --> 13:26.296
but Zoe can be a little... you know.

13:26.328 --> 13:28.665
I don't... I don't think so.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.441
- Hmm.
- What?

13:37.474 --> 13:39.509
I don't think I like cats.

13:39.542 --> 13:43.314
- Stop it.
- I'm serious.

13:45.615 --> 13:47.051
I don't think I like cats.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.353
Well, you love Charlie.

13:51.153 --> 13:52.655
I like dogs.

13:52.688 --> 13:56.325
I love dogs.
My sister's allergic to dogs.

13:56.359 --> 13:58.461
I grew up thinking as soon
as I get out on my own,

13:58.495 --> 14:00.764
I'm gonna get a dog.

14:00.797 --> 14:03.533
You said if we didn't bring
Charlie home, no one would.

14:05.567 --> 14:06.602
Yeah.

14:08.337 --> 14:09.372
Still.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.642
Something's not right.

14:19.581 --> 14:21.283
Tommy changed our timeline.

14:21.317 --> 14:24.488
- No, he didn't.
- Three phasings in one year.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.756
That does not happen
by accident.

14:26.789 --> 14:28.724
That son of a bitch.
It's just...

14:28.758 --> 14:32.763
Janine, I feel it.
I feel we had a dog.

14:34.096 --> 14:36.566
And we loved that dog.

14:36.599 --> 14:39.403
- We saved Charlie together.
- And that rich asshole...

14:39.436 --> 14:43.105
- Tommy used to be your friend.
- That was before. That was way before.

14:43.139 --> 14:45.542
He wants you back, Janine.
He wants you back.

14:45.575 --> 14:48.378
And now he's going,
he's going jaunting through time...

14:48.410 --> 14:52.381
To make us never happen. What we
need to do is report him to the police.

14:52.414 --> 14:55.418
It is not a time crime unless someone
actually changes our timeline.

14:55.451 --> 14:58.355
And obviously he hasn't,
so there's nothing they can do.

15:00.389 --> 15:02.324
Then maybe I go back in time.

15:02.357 --> 15:07.163
Maybe I go back in time
and Tommy has a little accident.

15:07.197 --> 15:10.700
- Jesus Christ, Nick!
- And you never meet Tommy,

15:10.732 --> 15:13.069
you never marry him,
and we never end up in this mess.

15:13.102 --> 15:16.072
The only reason we're
together is because of Tommy.

15:16.105 --> 15:20.309
I never marry Tommy,
I never meet you. Never.

15:20.342 --> 15:24.313
And what you're talking about,
going back in time and hurting him...

15:24.346 --> 15:28.384
Just promise me you won't
do anything like that.

15:29.652 --> 15:30.687
Nick.

15:32.121 --> 15:34.323
I can't go jaunting.
I'm not rich like Tommy.

15:34.356 --> 15:36.159
Nick, promise me.

15:40.629 --> 15:41.831
What are you looking at?

15:45.301 --> 15:46.836
What if we had kids?

15:50.840 --> 15:52.475
Janine, what if we had a family?

15:56.846 --> 16:00.283
- We would remember that.
- If Tommy changed our past,

16:00.316 --> 16:01.756
two or three hours
after it happened,

16:01.783 --> 16:03.386
we wouldn't remember any of it.

16:06.688 --> 16:08.224
Something's not right.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.393
Will you stop it?

16:10.692 --> 16:11.727
Please.

16:14.230 --> 16:16.133
We've been married
for five years.

16:16.166 --> 16:19.536
We have a cat, Charlie,
who we adore.

16:19.568 --> 16:20.837
We have each other.

16:23.273 --> 16:25.375
You always say to me that
even if you didn't know me,

16:25.408 --> 16:27.277
you would still love me.

16:29.345 --> 16:31.248
No one can make us not happen.

16:33.182 --> 16:34.217
No one.

16:36.451 --> 16:37.687
Okay?

16:42.225 --> 16:43.259
Okay.

16:44.561 --> 16:45.596
Okay.

16:55.572 --> 16:58.207
<i>Time doesn't mean
the same thing that it used to.</i>

16:58.240 --> 17:01.912
<i>Time traveling and phasings,
that is just how life is now.</i>

17:01.945 --> 17:04.881
<i>Rich people,
they get to fly private jets to Kyoto</i>

17:04.913 --> 17:08.585
<i>and jaunt through time and park
their yachts off the coast of Monaco.</i>

17:08.617 --> 17:10.886
<i>Don't hate the player,
hate the game.</i>

17:10.920 --> 17:13.757
<i>Honestly, to me the part
that's a little pathetic</i>

17:13.789 --> 17:15.959
<i>is you and him
fighting over Janine.</i>

17:15.991 --> 17:19.261
- <i>You're like cavemen.</i>
- Yeah, well, she's my wife.

17:19.295 --> 17:21.364
<i>She was Tommy's wife first.</i>

17:21.396 --> 17:23.832
- They got a divorce!
- <i>She fell in love with you.</i>

17:23.865 --> 17:27.637
She fell in love with me
after they got a divorce!

17:28.438 --> 17:31.274
<i>Yeah? After?</i>

17:31.307 --> 17:34.577
<i>Or maybe you changed
their lives a little.</i>

17:34.611 --> 17:37.747
<i>I'm not saying
on purpose, but...</i>

17:37.779 --> 17:40.683
<i>Maybe there's something that
you did that changed them</i>

17:40.717 --> 17:43.453
<i>just enough for them
to not be a couple anymore.</i>

17:43.486 --> 17:46.355
<i>Sometimes change isn't a bad thing.
Remember Alex?</i>

17:46.388 --> 17:48.466
<i>You used to be so sure that
you were gonna marry her.</i>

17:48.490 --> 17:51.394
Alex was long
before I met Janine.

17:51.426 --> 17:56.298
I'm not losing my wife
to her ex-husband.

17:56.332 --> 17:58.935
<i>So, your version
of saving your marriage</i>

17:58.968 --> 18:01.004
<i>is to sit at home
and argue with Janine...</i>

18:01.037 --> 18:03.240
- We weren't arguing.
- <i>About cats and dogs,</i>

18:03.272 --> 18:05.541
<i>or if the children you never had</i>

18:05.575 --> 18:07.277
<i>were boys or girls.</i>

18:07.309 --> 18:09.445
<i>You talk about Tommy
being obsessed.</i>

18:09.479 --> 18:11.581
<i>You are so worried
about life not changing,</i>

18:11.614 --> 18:13.254
<i>you are gonna end up
losing what you have.</i>

18:13.282 --> 18:14.760
You've got a lot of advice
for somebody

18:14.784 --> 18:17.221
who's never actually
been in a relationship.

18:20.355 --> 18:21.391
Hello?

18:22.491 --> 18:24.260
<i>That's really fucking mature.</i>

18:26.729 --> 18:30.267
- Hey, Zoe, I'm sorry.
- <i>Are you?</i>

18:30.299 --> 18:32.402
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- <i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

19:30.359 --> 19:33.329
<i>Hambleton solutions.
How can I direct your call?</i>

19:33.363 --> 19:34.931
Tommy Hambleton's office please.

19:34.963 --> 19:36.899
<i>Hold a moment.</i>

19:39.769 --> 19:41.738
<i>Tommy Hambleton's office.</i>

19:41.770 --> 19:44.074
This is Nick mikkelsen.
I'd like to leave a message...

19:44.106 --> 19:45.875
<i>I'll see if he's available.</i>

19:45.907 --> 19:48.444
No, no, no. I said I'd love
to leave a message for...

19:50.145 --> 19:51.380
Hello?

19:53.115 --> 19:54.350
<i>Hello?</i>

19:58.554 --> 19:59.589
<i>Hello?</i>

20:01.656 --> 20:04.894
Hey, Tommy?
Hey, it's Nick. Mikkelsen.

20:04.926 --> 20:06.762
<i>Nick, I swear.</i>

20:06.796 --> 20:08.932
<i>I was almost literally thinking
we never talk anymore,</i>

20:08.964 --> 20:10.599
<i>then they tell me
you're on the line.</i>

20:10.633 --> 20:12.836
<i>How are ya? How's things?</i>

20:12.868 --> 20:16.538
- Uh, things are good, man. Real good.
- <i>Glad to hear that.</i>

20:16.571 --> 20:19.508
<i>Listen, Tommy. I...</i>

20:19.541 --> 20:21.543
<i>I know you're probably
crazy busy. But I was hoping</i>

20:21.576 --> 20:24.948
<i>maybe we could...
Get together and catch up.</i>

20:24.980 --> 20:28.917
<i>Absolutely. You up for a drink?
How about the loft?</i>

20:28.951 --> 20:31.855
<i>We could make it this evening
if you've got time.</i>

20:31.887 --> 20:35.791
<i>Yeah, I can make that work.
Be great to see you.</i>

20:35.825 --> 20:39.461
I spent half my life thinking the last thing
I'm gonna do is be my father, you know?

20:39.494 --> 20:43.432
Waste my life working away
at the business. His business.

20:43.465 --> 20:45.634
Then one day my father announces

20:45.667 --> 20:47.713
he's stepping down from the company
and he makes it pretty clear

20:47.737 --> 20:49.473
I need to do the right thing.

20:51.106 --> 20:54.543
So I start to think,
as big as the company is...

20:55.711 --> 20:57.114
It's still a family business.

20:58.513 --> 20:59.849
It's my name on the door.

21:01.183 --> 21:02.952
I've got to make sure
that it's...

21:04.886 --> 21:07.423
That people respect the name.

21:07.457 --> 21:10.894
Sounds like a lot of work.
You have any time for fun?

21:10.926 --> 21:13.862
Not like when we were younger.
The la jolla days, that's for sure.

21:13.895 --> 21:15.065
Lonely at the top, huh?

21:18.067 --> 21:21.037
Hey, you talk to Alex lately?

21:21.770 --> 21:22.806
Alex?

21:27.242 --> 21:29.111
I haven't spoken
to Alex in years.

21:29.144 --> 21:30.713
Wonder what she's up to.

21:31.646 --> 21:32.848
You should call her.

21:34.784 --> 21:36.704
Alex was your girlfriend.
Why don't you call her?

21:39.521 --> 21:41.156
I still talk to Tate and Donna.

21:41.190 --> 21:45.595
They said you do the time jaunting thing.
Must be nice.

21:45.627 --> 21:49.999
You never been jaunting?
It's amazing. Time traveling.

21:50.031 --> 21:53.035
The past doesn't just belong to old
photos and history books anymore.

21:53.068 --> 21:56.172
Now we can live it. Touch it.

21:56.204 --> 21:57.973
- Be part of it.
- Change it.

21:59.741 --> 22:01.744
Nobody can really
change the past.

22:02.811 --> 22:04.580
Just clean up
the present a little.

22:08.084 --> 22:11.855
How are you? How you doing?

22:11.887 --> 22:14.723
<i>I'm good. I'm good. You know.</i>

22:14.757 --> 22:18.961
Janine and I
are having problems.

22:18.994 --> 22:23.031
Caught up in a couple of phasings
last year. Pretty serious.

22:23.065 --> 22:24.734
There was another one
more recently.

22:24.767 --> 22:26.568
The little annoyances
of modern life, eh?

22:26.602 --> 22:28.505
They're more than
little annoyances.

22:29.905 --> 22:32.808
Our lives shifted, you know.

22:32.842 --> 22:35.945
I'm afraid that one day I'll wake
up and Janine won't be there,

22:35.978 --> 22:38.781
I won't remember her
or being married to her.

22:38.814 --> 22:41.651
I'm worried somebody's trying
to break me and Janine up.

22:41.683 --> 22:45.120
Why would that surprise you?
Janine's an amazing person.

22:45.153 --> 22:47.523
As soon as we got divorced,
she couldn't wait to marry you.

22:47.557 --> 22:49.125
Wait a second. That's not...

22:50.726 --> 22:52.962
I didn't steal Janine from you.

22:52.994 --> 22:55.130
Nobody belongs to anybody, Nick.

22:55.163 --> 22:57.567
But you meet a person,
you become their partner,

22:57.599 --> 23:00.836
and once you're together,
you alter maybe a dozen other timelines.

23:00.869 --> 23:02.671
None of them ever happened

23:02.704 --> 23:05.040
because one relationship
negates all other possibilities.

23:05.074 --> 23:06.109
What if...

23:09.178 --> 23:10.213
What about her?

23:12.882 --> 23:16.586
What if the two of you
decided to fall in love?

23:16.618 --> 23:19.622
What other person would never know
what it's like to be with her?

23:21.324 --> 23:24.627
Or laugh with her. Or spend
a lost weekend with her

23:24.660 --> 23:27.130
in Madrid, Milan, or Milwaukee.

23:27.163 --> 23:30.133
Just because luck said
you should meet her first.

23:30.165 --> 23:33.101
Love is its own kind of crime,
and every time we fall in love

23:33.134 --> 23:35.070
we're just stealing a
person from somebody else

23:35.104 --> 23:36.782
and all the possibilities
that come with them.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.283
Are you trying
to steal Janine from me?

23:38.307 --> 23:42.045
That would be illegal.
Illegal, immoral...

23:42.077 --> 23:44.279
Are you going back in time
to try to make us not happen?

23:44.313 --> 23:46.149
Because that's the kind
of thing I do, right?

23:46.182 --> 23:47.726
- I know what you all think about me.
- All?

23:47.750 --> 23:49.184
- Who's all, Tommy?
- You.

23:49.218 --> 23:50.954
Everybody
from the la jolla days.

23:50.987 --> 23:53.590
You thought I was just
some spoiled rich kid

23:53.623 --> 23:55.357
born into money.
You still think that.

23:55.391 --> 23:57.826
Tommy, you... you got stuff

23:57.859 --> 24:00.037
you need to work out,
and clearly time traveling's not doing it.

24:00.061 --> 24:02.064
If I was lucky enough
to have your money...

24:02.097 --> 24:04.032
And that's all I've ever been.
Lucky, right?

24:04.066 --> 24:07.002
Let me tell you something.
I was lucky one time in my life.

24:07.036 --> 24:10.206
The day I met Janine.
And if I'd really known that...

24:12.407 --> 24:14.977
I never would've let
our marriage fall apart.

24:16.945 --> 24:19.915
So... you know.

24:21.083 --> 24:24.287
From the man who lost her
to the man who's with her...

24:25.354 --> 24:27.923
Cherish the day, Nick. Be happy.

24:27.957 --> 24:31.828
Happiness is the only thing
more fleeting than time.

24:43.204 --> 24:45.073
<i>Hi. Can I help you?</i>

24:45.106 --> 24:48.344
Yeah. I've been having trouble
with some time track shifts.

24:48.376 --> 24:51.114
Looking to do something about it.
You know, before it gets worse.

24:51.146 --> 24:53.883
- Do you know much about our company?
- Saw an ad online.

24:53.915 --> 24:58.721
Okay. Past protect is an innovator
in memory storage protection.

24:58.753 --> 25:02.424
We offer powerful solutions for any
number of time track retrieval issues

25:02.458 --> 25:05.662
with instant access from your
desktop or mobile device.

25:05.694 --> 25:08.431
And with past protect you get
a 100% money-back guarantee

25:08.463 --> 25:13.035
should any of your memories be
lost due to ripples, phasings...

25:13.068 --> 25:16.004
- So if you lose my memories...
- You would be eligible

25:16.038 --> 25:18.441
for a 100% money-back
guarantee. Yeah.

25:18.473 --> 25:22.010
That's not
a guarantee against loss.

25:22.044 --> 25:27.250
Well, no one can guarantee 100%
retention of the memories themselves.

25:27.282 --> 25:29.851
But our success rate
is among the highest

25:29.884 --> 25:32.296
in the time track phase-disruption
memory-protection industry.

25:32.320 --> 25:34.122
<i>And I give you
the memories, how?</i>

25:34.155 --> 25:35.825
<i>Once you open
an account with us,</i>

25:35.857 --> 25:38.427
<i>you upload files,
photos, videos,</i>

25:38.461 --> 25:42.330
<i>that are already digitized to our
chronomatically insulated servers.</i>

25:42.364 --> 25:46.403
<i>If you think you've been hit by a
phase, call us and we'll do the rest.</i>

25:49.438 --> 25:53.476
<i>Phasings, you know,
they're just a part of life.</i>

25:53.509 --> 25:56.278
<i>But I really think they make
the memories more precious.</i>

26:18.834 --> 26:20.370
Hi. Hi.

26:26.307 --> 26:28.077
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

26:31.180 --> 26:32.315
- How was your day?
- Good.

26:32.347 --> 26:33.817
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:38.019 --> 26:40.189
They were just going
for their final rehearsal

26:40.221 --> 26:43.091
and I was just shooting
the performance space.

26:43.125 --> 26:45.361
It is a beautiful venue.

26:45.394 --> 26:48.064
I think it's going to be
an amazing show. Yeah.

26:48.096 --> 26:50.200
- Guess what I did today?
- What?

26:51.333 --> 26:54.370
- I got us a time capsule.
- A what?

26:55.270 --> 26:57.240
A time capsule.

26:57.272 --> 27:02.144
You upload all your photos
and your videos onto...

27:02.178 --> 27:04.247
Essentially a... a big server.

27:04.279 --> 27:06.915
And that way if
there's a time phase...

27:06.949 --> 27:10.120
I just walked through the door and
you're already talking about phasing.

27:12.855 --> 27:15.224
Well I'm talking about
protecting our memories.

27:19.595 --> 27:23.298
- Where is this place?
- Over at the mall.

27:23.332 --> 27:27.470
It's a...
Memory protection place

27:27.502 --> 27:30.807
that's located between foot locker and Mrs.
fields' cookies?

27:32.007 --> 27:34.043
Look. It doesn't matter
where they are.

27:34.076 --> 27:36.511
It matters what they can do.

27:36.545 --> 27:39.215
- And they can protect our...
- I'm just sick of talking about it.

27:39.248 --> 27:40.850
Well, I'm not talking about it.

27:40.883 --> 27:43.353
I'm doing something
about it. I'm...

27:44.286 --> 27:46.122
Just whatever. Whatever.

27:47.021 --> 27:50.259
Whatever. Whatever.

27:50.291 --> 27:53.562
Whatever I have to do to protect
our memories and hold onto our life.

27:53.596 --> 27:57.098
If I have to go
to a memory protection place,

27:57.132 --> 27:59.869
- if I have to talk to Tommy...
- You talked to Tommy?

28:00.869 --> 28:05.273
I told you to leave it.
He wasn't gonna do anything.

28:05.307 --> 28:08.477
He's tried three times, Janine!
That we know about!

28:08.509 --> 28:11.446
- You're just gonna make him mad.
- What do I care how Tommy feels?

28:11.480 --> 28:14.517
We don't have to antagonize him.
He wasn't gonna do anything.

28:21.891 --> 28:24.227
You keep saying
he wasn't gonna do anything,

28:24.259 --> 28:28.897
and I'm wondering how you know that.
Janine.

28:30.465 --> 28:32.067
How do you know that?

28:38.007 --> 28:39.442
Did you talk to Tommy?

28:42.443 --> 28:44.113
Did you talk to Tommy?

28:50.152 --> 28:51.287
Did you see him?

28:54.323 --> 28:56.325
What the...

28:56.357 --> 28:59.328
- You went to see him.
- I just...

29:00.930 --> 29:02.899
I just wanted to make him
leave us alone.

29:02.932 --> 29:05.367
- By going to be with him, Janine!
- Oh, my god.

29:05.401 --> 29:07.135
That is what he wants.

29:07.169 --> 29:09.105
- He wants to be with you.
- Stop!

29:09.137 --> 29:11.206
He wants to take you from me!

29:12.074 --> 29:13.976
I...

29:14.009 --> 29:15.478
- Do you still love him?
- No!

29:17.011 --> 29:19.056
- But you went to see him, so...
- I was married to him.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.884
You don't just stop caring about
the people you used to love.

29:25.153 --> 29:29.092
- Where'd you see him?
- At his office.

29:30.291 --> 29:32.394
- Just at his office.
- Yes. Yes.

29:34.395 --> 29:40.002
We met in the lobby and...
Just sat off to the side.

29:42.538 --> 29:44.574
I just tried
to explain to him that...

29:47.675 --> 29:51.547
I know he wishes that
we could try again, but...

29:53.548 --> 29:55.484
That... that it's over.

29:57.685 --> 29:58.922
He...

30:01.190 --> 30:03.592
He tried to show me
that he'd changed.

30:03.625 --> 30:07.128
That he... appreciated me.

30:07.162 --> 30:09.164
- He tried to show you, how?
- Yeah.

30:09.198 --> 30:10.934
How did he try to show you?

30:16.137 --> 30:17.472
He gave me a gift.

30:26.115 --> 30:28.049
I made him promise that if...

30:28.083 --> 30:30.086
If I kept it, that
he would he would...

30:32.186 --> 30:36.192
He would leave us alone.
He would stop trying to phase us.

30:36.224 --> 30:39.528
But I didn't know what to do
and I didn't want to tell you,

30:39.560 --> 30:41.429
but I couldn't hide it. Nick.

30:41.462 --> 30:43.266
- This fucking thing was from him.
- Nick!

30:45.666 --> 30:46.702
Nick!

30:49.805 --> 30:52.008
Charlie! Charlie!

30:52.040 --> 30:54.275
I don't want it here.

31:02.483 --> 31:05.487
- Help me find Charlie.
- I don't like cats.

32:02.544 --> 32:04.714
So... um...

32:06.815 --> 32:09.786
I just want you to try and
understand why I did what I did.

32:12.887 --> 32:18.159
I know... you used to
be friends with Tommy...

32:18.192 --> 32:20.695
And because you despise him
you think I should just be able

32:20.729 --> 32:24.067
to hate him, too. But...

32:25.500 --> 32:27.435
But it's different for me.

32:27.469 --> 32:30.338
<i>You've never
been married before.</i>

32:30.372 --> 32:32.807
<i>I spent almost eight years
with Tommy</i>

32:32.840 --> 32:35.243
<i>and that doesn't just go away.</i>

32:35.277 --> 32:39.347
<i>I don't love him,
but I don't not care about Tommy</i>

32:39.381 --> 32:42.184
<i>and I can't forget about
the time we spent together</i>

32:42.217 --> 32:48.858
<i>because the good, bad,
the everyday things.</i>

32:48.891 --> 32:53.129
<i>Because every day led
to the moment that I met you.</i>

32:54.730 --> 32:57.266
<i>I see what Tommy's doing to you.</i>

32:57.298 --> 32:59.701
<i>And, Nick, you talk about going
back in time and hurting him.</i>

32:59.734 --> 33:03.538
<i>And maybe you're just so frustrated and
angry that you're just saying things.</i>

33:03.571 --> 33:06.141
<i>But do you know
how that makes me feel?</i>

33:06.174 --> 33:08.443
<i>Do you know
how that frightens me?</i>

33:08.477 --> 33:14.350
<i>So, if seeing Tommy and taking
some stupid gift from him</i>

33:14.383 --> 33:19.288
<i>makes it all just stop,
then it has to stop.</i>

33:19.320 --> 33:23.826
<i>The money Tommy spends on going back
in time to try to break us up...</i>

33:26.295 --> 33:27.563
<i>He can't undo us.</i>

33:30.665 --> 33:31.833
<i>Only we can do that.</i>

33:38.973 --> 33:41.777
Love is drawn
in the form of a circle.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.516
No one knows when it begins.

33:48.217 --> 33:49.652
And it never really ends.

33:53.721 --> 33:55.290
You and I, we're just...

33:57.925 --> 33:59.327
We're forever.

34:02.763 --> 34:07.469
Always... and all ways.

34:36.697 --> 34:38.333
- Hey, Zoe.
- <i>Nick.</i>

34:38.367 --> 34:40.502
You'll never believe
what I found out.

34:40.534 --> 34:42.737
So, Janine's been seeing Tommy.

34:42.771 --> 34:44.807
- Not... okay, not seeing.
- <i>Hold on.</i>

34:44.840 --> 34:47.276
But she saw him
and he gave her a gift.

34:47.309 --> 34:49.778
This little shitty
casio TV thing. And...

34:49.811 --> 34:52.548
<i>Nick, listen to me.
Sibila's dead.</i>

34:54.315 --> 34:57.252
<i>She was climbing and she fell.</i>

35:05.559 --> 35:06.661
<i>She didn't make it.</i>

35:07.795 --> 35:10.531
<i>I was supposed to be there.</i>

35:10.565 --> 35:12.668
<i>I was supposed to be with her
and I didn't go.</i>

35:18.606 --> 35:20.242
<i>Zoe, can I come see you?</i>

35:22.978 --> 35:24.413
<i>I would really like that.</i>

35:38.693 --> 35:44.565
I had to call her parents.
I didn't know what to say.

35:44.599 --> 35:48.504
Literally, didn't know what to say.
I don't speak Portuguese.

35:50.072 --> 35:51.907
I had to say it like...

35:52.940 --> 35:55.644
Three or four times.

35:56.945 --> 35:57.980
She's dead.

35:59.380 --> 36:00.715
Your daughter's dead.

36:02.784 --> 36:05.887
They don't understand me,
so what do I do?

36:07.922 --> 36:09.625
I start talking louder.

36:13.795 --> 36:16.731
Every time I say it,
the more real it gets.

36:16.764 --> 36:18.366
Sibila's dead.

36:21.036 --> 36:22.371
What if she's not?

36:24.039 --> 36:27.443
Maybe it's just a phase.
Maybe it's something in the time track.

36:27.476 --> 36:28.943
I remember her.

36:28.976 --> 36:31.846
If it was just a phase,
I wouldn't remember her.

36:36.784 --> 36:39.621
- I wish I didn't remember.
- Come on, don't say that.

36:41.088 --> 36:42.824
She was your best friend.

36:44.059 --> 36:46.696
- She needs to be remembered.
- Remember what?

36:48.864 --> 36:51.800
I was supposed to go
with her and I didn't.

36:51.833 --> 36:53.035
I should've been there.

36:55.670 --> 36:59.842
I've been walking around the last
day with nothing but guilt and hurt.

36:59.875 --> 37:02.010
Guilt and hurt
is not what you two had.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.949
I used to joke with Janine
I didn't get it.

37:08.849 --> 37:10.885
I didn't get it,
how you have a best friend

37:10.918 --> 37:12.958
you don't speak the same language.
But that's how...

37:14.489 --> 37:16.125
Tight you two were.

37:16.157 --> 37:18.527
You didn't need to speak
the same language

37:18.559 --> 37:22.697
to be with one another,
care about one another.

37:22.731 --> 37:26.602
And when you care about somebody,
that's all that matters.

37:30.838 --> 37:32.875
I'm so sorry I got
on you about Tommy...

37:32.907 --> 37:36.010
- I'm not worried about Tommy now.
- How you were fighting over Janine.

37:36.043 --> 37:39.147
I didn't have a clue what it was
like to lose somebody you love.

37:41.516 --> 37:42.718
Hold onto her, Nick.

37:43.985 --> 37:46.922
With everything you've got.
Hold onto your wife.

37:51.927 --> 37:55.698
<i>He can't undo us.
Only we can do that.</i>

37:58.532 --> 38:01.170
<i>Love is drawn
in the form of a circle.</i>

38:01.202 --> 38:03.838
<i>No one knows where it begins...</i>

38:04.873 --> 38:06.509
<i>And it never really ends.</i>

38:09.811 --> 38:10.846
<i>You and I...</i>

38:13.715 --> 38:14.750
<i>We're forever.</i>

38:16.617 --> 38:17.652
<i>Always...</i>

38:20.021 --> 38:21.590
<i>And all ways.</i>

39:11.005 --> 39:13.041
I'd like to go
somewhere with you.

39:13.875 --> 39:14.909
Where?

39:16.777 --> 39:17.812
Anywhere.

39:20.681 --> 39:21.716
When?

39:23.018 --> 39:25.086
Now.

39:25.119 --> 39:27.097
You just spent the last week
barely saying a word to me.

39:27.121 --> 39:28.523
We'll run away.

39:30.157 --> 39:34.797
We'll run away until we...
Run out of spaces to be in.

39:41.268 --> 39:45.507
Anything we need, we'll find.
Whatever we don't have, we'll buy.

39:48.342 --> 39:51.012
Just...

39:56.184 --> 39:58.254
Just be with me always.

40:01.121 --> 40:02.657
And all ways.

40:20.775 --> 40:21.809
Mikkelsen.

40:23.911 --> 40:25.346
May I see your boarding passes?

40:25.380 --> 40:26.849
I have the tickets.

40:27.949 --> 40:28.983
One second.

40:35.824 --> 40:37.992
Would you mind if I take
a picture of her?

40:38.025 --> 40:39.661
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

41:28.143 --> 41:29.177
Nick.

41:31.146 --> 41:32.181
Janine!

41:32.914 --> 41:33.949
Janine!

41:56.871 --> 41:57.905
What the...

42:02.242 --> 42:03.277
Janine.

42:05.179 --> 42:09.817
Janine? Janine! Janine!

42:09.851 --> 42:13.155
- Hekima, call Janine.
- <i>I don't see that name in your contacts.</i>

42:13.188 --> 42:16.324
- <i>Would you like me to try again?</i>
- Look for Janine mikkelsen.

42:16.356 --> 42:18.893
<i>I'm sorry.
There's no one listed by that name.</i>

42:18.927 --> 42:20.738
- Her maiden name.
- <i>Would you like me to try again?</i>

42:20.762 --> 42:23.365
- Her maiden name. Carter.
- <i>I didn't get that.</i>

42:23.398 --> 42:25.467
- Look up Janine Carter.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

42:25.500 --> 42:27.168
<i>There's no one listed
by that name.</i>

42:27.202 --> 42:28.737
<i>Would you like me to try again?</i>

42:28.769 --> 42:31.139
Oh, fuck.

42:38.179 --> 42:39.213
Fuck.

43:19.487 --> 43:21.056
- Hello?
- <i>Nicholas?</i>

43:21.889 --> 43:24.259
<i>It's me. Janine.</i>

43:24.291 --> 43:27.228
<i>Say it with me.
Janine mikkelsen.</i>

43:27.262 --> 43:30.231
<i>I was married
to Nicholas Perry mikkelsen.</i>

43:30.264 --> 43:32.500
- Was?
- <i>We live at...</i>

43:33.568 --> 43:36.071
<i>We lived at 11...</i>

43:36.103 --> 43:39.407
<i>We... we had a cat. Charlie.</i>

43:43.244 --> 43:45.547
- Where are you?
- <i>I'm with Tommy.</i>

43:45.579 --> 43:49.016
- <i>We've been married nine years.</i>
- Nine years? It's only been a few minutes.

43:49.050 --> 43:52.387
<i>You and I never met. An hour or two
and we won't remember each other.</i>

43:52.420 --> 43:54.523
Janine, Janine. Listen to me.
You don't love Tommy.

43:54.556 --> 43:56.358
- <i>He's different, Nick.</i>
- He changed the past.

43:56.391 --> 43:58.193
- <i>He's kinder.</i>
- He changed the past.

43:58.226 --> 44:00.162
<i>I want you to remember.
Love is drawn</i>

44:00.195 --> 44:01.897
<i>in the form of a circle.</i>

44:01.929 --> 44:03.273
Wherever you are,
whenever you are,

44:03.297 --> 44:04.332
I will find you.

44:05.833 --> 44:08.903
Okay? We'll find our way back.
All right?

44:11.005 --> 44:12.039
Janine?

44:15.043 --> 44:16.077
Janine?

44:25.018 --> 44:28.255
<i>Mr. Mikkelsen, our technicians
have been through the server</i>

44:28.289 --> 44:31.560
<i>and we weren't able to retrieve
any of your memories at this time.</i>

44:31.592 --> 44:34.995
- What does that mean?
- Well, our technicians will keep looking,

44:35.028 --> 44:36.573
but the phase you were hit
with was really rough

44:36.597 --> 44:38.532
and every time shift
is its own thing...

44:38.565 --> 44:42.971
I'm starting to forget my wife.
I'm starting to lose her.

44:43.003 --> 44:47.576
What we can do, your purchase comes
with a 100% money-back guarantee.

44:47.608 --> 44:49.610
You are entitled to a
full refund of any amount.

44:49.643 --> 44:51.145
I want my memories.

44:52.280 --> 44:55.182
Okay. Every phase
is its own thing,

44:55.215 --> 44:58.920
and at this time, we're just not able
to retrieve any of your memories.

45:00.954 --> 45:03.991
Did you want me to start
processing that refund?

45:23.344 --> 45:25.347
Hekima, I live at...

45:25.380 --> 45:27.349
- <i>Would you like to go home?</i>
- Yes.

45:27.382 --> 45:28.983
<i>I can put that on your map.</i>

45:29.016 --> 45:30.852
<i>Done.</i>

46:48.996 --> 46:50.031
Hey.

46:51.298 --> 46:52.434
Hey, Charlie.

46:53.568 --> 46:56.405
Hey. How you doing?

46:57.271 --> 46:58.507
How's that good boy?

47:02.210 --> 47:03.244
Hey.

47:07.382 --> 47:08.416
Alex.

47:09.550 --> 47:10.652
You all right?

47:12.652 --> 47:15.255
Goodness, you... you're warm.

47:15.289 --> 47:18.059
You know what?
I'm just gonna call Tate and Donna

47:18.092 --> 47:19.535
and tell them
we can't make it tonight.

47:19.559 --> 47:21.262
We can celebrate
with them later.

47:25.500 --> 47:26.534
Celebrate what?

47:30.338 --> 47:33.108
Are you just trying to be funny?

47:33.141 --> 47:36.110
You know, their adoption went
through, they're a family now?

47:38.746 --> 47:41.182
Make sure you text them
and congratulate them

47:41.215 --> 47:43.218
and I'll just order in.

47:43.251 --> 47:44.652
Do you want anything?

47:44.684 --> 47:46.721
Thai food perhaps?
The place you like?

47:49.757 --> 47:51.126
Yeah, sure.

48:05.539 --> 48:08.275
What we want to
accomplish in our next pass

48:08.309 --> 48:13.248
is making allowances for the
outcome of our planning stages.

48:13.280 --> 48:16.784
Have we taken into consideration
environmental impact?

48:16.818 --> 48:20.288
Have we really thought through the
cause and effect of our choices?

48:20.320 --> 48:24.726
Within a design itself,
how are we allowing

48:24.759 --> 48:29.731
for fluctuations in human density
and changes in social grids?

48:29.764 --> 48:33.201
What's most important
is maintaining connectivity

48:33.233 --> 48:37.371
as we consider the long-term
ramifications of modern living.

49:01.561 --> 49:02.596
Hey.

49:04.898 --> 49:06.567
Hey.

49:06.601 --> 49:10.472
- Just finishing up with work?
- Yeah.

49:10.505 --> 49:13.208
Ah, they've really got you
hitting it, huh?

49:15.610 --> 49:19.380
- I'll take Charlie for a walk.
- I just took him out.

49:19.413 --> 49:22.250
Yeah, I've been
sitting around all day.

49:22.282 --> 49:24.318
Really want to go for a walk.
Come on, Charlie.

49:29.489 --> 49:30.524
Let's go.

50:26.746 --> 50:27.781
Hey.

50:29.483 --> 50:30.519
Hey.

50:31.518 --> 50:32.553
I'm going to work.

50:35.822 --> 50:36.924
Okay.

50:38.826 --> 50:40.494
Are you going to be late
again tonight?

50:41.661 --> 50:42.797
I don't know.

50:44.931 --> 50:46.233
Probably.

50:51.338 --> 50:52.373
Okay.

50:54.407 --> 50:57.244
If you're going to be late,
I'm gonna try and get together with Donna.

50:59.981 --> 51:01.216
Okay.

51:04.318 --> 51:05.387
Okay.

51:09.956 --> 51:11.960
<i>There's something
different with us.</i>

51:11.992 --> 51:17.431
I know things don't change overnight,
but it feels like they have.

51:17.465 --> 51:22.836
We're... we're just becoming so
distant and I don't know why.

51:24.038 --> 51:29.476
And I miss spending time with Nick.
I miss... you know what I miss?

51:29.510 --> 51:31.313
I miss dancing.

51:32.612 --> 51:34.648
Yeah.

51:34.681 --> 51:37.417
Nick used to take me dancing
every other weekend

51:37.451 --> 51:40.755
and we'd get drunk
like a couple of kids and...

51:41.822 --> 51:44.459
And dance like no one
was watching.

51:44.492 --> 51:46.260
All the better if they were.

51:51.465 --> 51:54.769
No, because I can't
do this alone.

51:54.802 --> 51:56.671
I can't.

51:56.704 --> 51:59.307
He has to want to work
on us, too, and...

52:00.407 --> 52:05.012
Well, if me not being around
is what makes him happy...

52:07.581 --> 52:09.483
Then I just want him
to be happy.

52:14.889 --> 52:16.458
I'm sorry, I...

52:19.592 --> 52:20.994
I just needed to talk to someone

52:21.027 --> 52:23.364
and I didn't know
who else to call.

52:24.898 --> 52:26.367
Thank you for listening.

52:38.813 --> 52:39.847
What's up?

52:42.016 --> 52:43.994
Friend of mine just having
troubles with her husband.

52:44.018 --> 52:45.820
Troubles like?

52:45.853 --> 52:47.789
I don't think
they're going to make it.

52:47.822 --> 52:49.856
- Good friend?
- Yeah.

52:49.889 --> 52:53.360
We used to be really
close back in la jolla.

52:53.393 --> 52:55.395
A long time ago.
It was before we met.

52:55.429 --> 52:56.798
Well, invite them out here.

52:58.666 --> 53:01.501
Fly 'em out.
Maybe it'll be good for them.

53:01.534 --> 53:03.046
We're not that close anymore.
He and I,

53:03.070 --> 53:04.873
- we kind of had a falling out.
- Over her?

53:06.639 --> 53:08.608
Why'd you say it like that?

53:08.641 --> 53:12.713
Because when guys have a falling
out, usually it's over a woman.

53:12.746 --> 53:15.916
It wasn't over her.
I always wanted them together.

53:17.684 --> 53:19.453
I thought they'd be
good for each other.

53:21.454 --> 53:22.990
I really thought
they'd be happy.

53:32.932 --> 53:35.336
<i>I've been thinking
of maybe taking a little trip.</i>

53:36.971 --> 53:38.005
Where?

53:40.407 --> 53:41.875
I've never been on a seaplane.

53:44.644 --> 53:45.679
What?

53:48.181 --> 53:50.551
I just think I need
a little getaway.

53:54.121 --> 53:55.356
I don't...

53:58.492 --> 53:59.627
For how long?

54:01.795 --> 54:02.963
Maybe a couple of weeks.

54:04.965 --> 54:06.067
By yourself?

54:45.005 --> 54:46.974
Look, if it's over,
just tell me.

54:48.775 --> 54:53.547
Because... something's
different and I can feel it.

54:58.585 --> 55:00.087
I know things change.

55:01.088 --> 55:04.858
But I always thought
you and I would be timeless.

55:07.561 --> 55:10.030
I come home at night and
you're there and I'm here,

55:10.063 --> 55:13.701
and I just don't
see us. I don't.

55:14.635 --> 55:18.105
So it needs to get better
or it needs to be done,

55:18.137 --> 55:20.708
but I'm not gonna put up
with not knowing which.

55:21.340 --> 55:22.911
Because I shouldn't have to.

55:25.579 --> 55:27.048
I deserve better than that.

55:36.523 --> 55:38.726
Tate and Donna are having
a dinner next week.

55:38.759 --> 55:41.628
Can you come to that
and at least act happy?

56:09.923 --> 56:13.061
- Alex?
- Hey. Hi.

56:14.961 --> 56:17.297
Oh, my god. It's been forever.
I'm so excited...

56:17.331 --> 56:19.767
<i>All those years of trying</i>

56:19.800 --> 56:22.870
<i>and then overnight we were
just this instant family.</i>

56:22.902 --> 56:25.071
<i>We didn't even get that
nine month run-up, you know.</i>

56:25.105 --> 56:26.807
Tate's freaking out.

56:26.840 --> 56:28.809
He worries too much about
trying to be a good dad

56:28.842 --> 56:31.012
instead of just being himself.

56:32.679 --> 56:34.781
That's what changes the most.

56:34.815 --> 56:38.920
You have a kid and you don't
get to be selfish anymore.

56:38.952 --> 56:41.188
You've got to be about
something besides yourself.

56:42.856 --> 56:46.528
It's hard, but... it's special.

56:47.760 --> 56:48.963
It's really special.

56:51.065 --> 56:53.343
I was starting to think I would
never have the opportunity

56:53.367 --> 56:56.971
to experience what it would
be like to be a family,

56:57.003 --> 57:01.576
but sometimes things work out
the way they're meant to.

1:00:19.806 --> 1:00:23.009
<i>Sometimes when you're not looking,
I'll watch you from across the room.</i>

1:00:25.512 --> 1:00:27.948
<i>And I'll ask myself,
if I didn't know you...</i>

1:00:30.851 --> 1:00:32.887
Would I still
fall in love with you?

1:00:34.954 --> 1:00:36.090
What's the answer?

1:01:17.496 --> 1:01:20.433
- Hey, zo.
- <i>Nick, hey.</i>

1:01:20.467 --> 1:01:23.838
<i>I have some good news.
It's really good news.</i>

1:01:24.637 --> 1:01:27.307
- What is it?
- <i>Sibila's alive.</i>

1:01:29.342 --> 1:01:32.178
- She's what?
- <i>She's alive.</i>

1:01:32.211 --> 1:01:34.248
<i>You were right.
It was just a phase.</i>

1:01:35.349 --> 1:01:37.484
But I remember her.

1:01:37.516 --> 1:01:39.519
If it was just a phase,
I wouldn't...

1:01:39.552 --> 1:01:42.623
<i>She's back and everything
is like it used to be.</i>

1:01:42.655 --> 1:01:45.025
<i>You guys have to come up
and celebrate.</i>

1:01:48.427 --> 1:01:52.465
Her parents were together
and happy their whole lives,

1:01:52.498 --> 1:01:54.968
but I just couldn't
ever see myself...

1:01:55.001 --> 1:01:57.438
Being with one person?

1:01:57.471 --> 1:02:01.342
Is there any other thing in life where the
point is to limit your opportunities to one?

1:02:01.375 --> 1:02:04.510
It scares me.

1:02:04.543 --> 1:02:09.182
Well, it's also what makes
relationships really exciting.

1:02:09.215 --> 1:02:12.085
Every day...
Every day is an adventure.

1:02:12.119 --> 1:02:15.021
Skydiving is an adventure.

1:02:15.054 --> 1:02:18.358
Monogamy is just
misery with company.

1:02:18.391 --> 1:02:21.527
Although Valentine's day
seems like a nice idea.

1:02:25.599 --> 1:02:27.601
How's the patient?

1:02:34.074 --> 1:02:35.541
All right, just
keep drinking water.

1:02:35.574 --> 1:02:37.543
- I say amputate.
- I'm good.

1:02:37.577 --> 1:02:41.682
As long as the next 20 miles
are downhill, I'm good.

1:02:47.688 --> 1:02:48.923
Okay.

1:02:49.623 --> 1:02:51.358
Where is she going?

1:02:51.391 --> 1:02:54.295
Um, I'm not sure.

1:02:54.327 --> 1:02:57.998
She's either looking for a place to
go caving or to go rock climbing.

1:02:58.030 --> 1:03:01.235
God, she's absolutely fearless.

1:03:01.268 --> 1:03:04.038
Sibila started climbing
when she was six.

1:03:04.070 --> 1:03:06.039
Now she goes every Sunday.

1:03:06.072 --> 1:03:07.273
Every Sunday.

1:03:07.306 --> 1:03:08.608
She says...

1:03:14.181 --> 1:03:17.117
This is my church.
I don't know how to say it,

1:03:17.150 --> 1:03:20.721
- I'm trying to learn Portuguese finally.
- She's amazing.

1:03:20.753 --> 1:03:23.156
If I had an accident like that,
you'd never catch me

1:03:23.190 --> 1:03:24.692
climbing again.

1:03:29.329 --> 1:03:30.932
She doesn't know what happened.

1:03:33.666 --> 1:03:35.335
How does she not know?

1:03:39.539 --> 1:03:41.709
You have to promise
not to tell her.

1:03:49.248 --> 1:03:50.583
It wasn't just a phase.

1:03:51.650 --> 1:03:53.153
She really did die.

1:03:54.521 --> 1:03:58.292
She doesn't know because I
went back in time and I...

1:04:00.226 --> 1:04:04.431
I changed things so she
didn't go climbing that day.

1:04:04.463 --> 1:04:07.034
You went jaunting.
Are you serious?

1:04:07.067 --> 1:04:08.202
What was I gonna do?

1:04:09.001 --> 1:04:11.706
She's my best friend.
I love her...

1:04:13.572 --> 1:04:14.607
And...

1:04:16.710 --> 1:04:20.514
I mean... it cost me
everything to go back.

1:04:21.815 --> 1:04:24.550
I'm completely fucked
for money right now.

1:04:24.583 --> 1:04:27.788
But if you saved her,
why don't you want her to know?

1:04:27.820 --> 1:04:30.056
You see how happy she is?

1:04:31.123 --> 1:04:35.695
I'm gonna tell her doing what
makes her happy killed her?

1:04:35.728 --> 1:04:40.033
She's back and I just want
everything to be like it was.

1:04:40.067 --> 1:04:42.369
Zoe, don't worry about money.

1:04:42.402 --> 1:04:46.340
If you need any help,
we'll do whatever we can. Okay?

1:04:50.476 --> 1:04:55.081
I know it doesn't look it...
But I've never been so happy.

1:04:59.286 --> 1:05:01.489
Come on. Let's go have fun.

1:05:02.789 --> 1:05:04.258
Sibila!

1:05:05.826 --> 1:05:07.061
Hey.

1:05:14.634 --> 1:05:17.204
One sec. Yeah, one sec.

1:05:18.338 --> 1:05:22.309
- Hello?
- <i>Hey. I'm trying to reach Nicholas mikkelsen.</i>

1:05:23.577 --> 1:05:26.346
- This is Nick.
- <i>Hey, Mr. Mikkelsen.</i>

1:05:26.378 --> 1:05:30.416
<i>It's Ryder from past protect.
Got some good news.</i>

1:05:30.449 --> 1:05:33.386
<i>Our technicians were able to
retrieve one of your memories</i>

1:05:33.420 --> 1:05:35.289
<i>that was stored on our server.</i>

1:05:35.322 --> 1:05:36.657
Wait a sec, who is this?

1:05:37.556 --> 1:05:40.293
<i>My name's Ryder
with past protect.</i>

1:05:43.163 --> 1:05:44.773
<i>You went through
a pretty severe time shift.</i>

1:05:44.797 --> 1:05:46.833
<i>There's probably
a lot you don't remember.</i>

1:05:46.867 --> 1:05:50.571
<i>Our technicians were able
to retrieve a memory for you.</i>

1:05:50.603 --> 1:05:52.705
<i>It's pretty short,
but they got it.</i>

1:05:52.739 --> 1:05:54.340
<i>I can put it
in your time capsule</i>

1:05:54.373 --> 1:05:55.708
<i>if you wanna check it out.</i>

1:08:00.266 --> 1:08:03.569
<i>What do you think
about when you think about us?</i>

1:08:03.603 --> 1:08:05.706
<i>I think about a lot of things.</i>

1:08:07.273 --> 1:08:08.775
What are the best times?

1:08:09.643 --> 1:08:11.244
La jolla.

1:08:11.277 --> 1:08:13.679
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

1:08:13.713 --> 1:08:17.918
Yeah, we were... we were
old enough to be adults

1:08:17.951 --> 1:08:21.755
- and young enough to act like children.
- Mm-hmm.

1:08:21.787 --> 1:08:26.726
And on the weekends, we'd go to the
beach, sit by the fire...

1:08:27.827 --> 1:08:32.800
- You, me, Tate, Donna, Tommy.
- Tommy?

1:08:35.068 --> 1:08:38.639
- I haven't talked to that guy in years.
- Really?

1:08:39.773 --> 1:08:40.975
You liked him.

1:08:41.975 --> 1:08:43.944
You were good friends, right?

1:08:43.976 --> 1:08:45.878
He was tough to take sometimes.

1:08:45.912 --> 1:08:47.681
He had a lot of ego going on.

1:08:48.581 --> 1:08:50.817
He had some insecurities, yes.

1:08:50.850 --> 1:08:52.786
And sometimes
they look the same.

1:08:54.854 --> 1:08:58.425
That was... it was
quite hard for Tommy.

1:09:00.092 --> 1:09:02.496
Tommy had everything.

1:09:04.564 --> 1:09:06.500
What, just because he had money?

1:09:09.402 --> 1:09:13.407
You have money. So what?

1:09:13.439 --> 1:09:15.641
You never really know
who your friends are,

1:09:15.675 --> 1:09:17.444
you don't know
if people like you for you...

1:09:17.476 --> 1:09:19.479
We liked him enough.

1:09:19.511 --> 1:09:21.881
You just said
you thought he was a jerk.

1:09:21.914 --> 1:09:25.286
Yes, sometimes he could be.

1:09:27.654 --> 1:09:30.023
So what, did you...

1:09:30.055 --> 1:09:33.526
Did you like him for him,
or did you just put up with him

1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:37.030
because he'd invite you to hang
at his father's private beach?

1:09:39.698 --> 1:09:44.970
- I'm just saying, it wasn't easy for Tommy.
- How do you know?

1:09:45.003 --> 1:09:47.974
Because I'd be the one he'd call

1:09:48.006 --> 1:09:52.378
when he felt alone and lonely and
just needed someone to talk to and...

1:09:53.212 --> 1:09:55.349
He just needed to sit
with somebody and...

1:09:56.483 --> 1:09:59.086
Cry sometimes.

1:10:00.653 --> 1:10:02.523
I'm sorry, cry?

1:10:03.590 --> 1:10:04.625
Yes.

1:10:05.524 --> 1:10:07.493
<i>Tommy's human.</i>

1:10:09.095 --> 1:10:12.798
<i>He has feelings just like
everybody else and he...</i>

1:10:12.832 --> 1:10:15.469
<i>He hurts
just like everybody else.</i>

1:10:15.502 --> 1:10:19.606
<i>Now, all the money in the world, it's...
It's no good for loneliness.</i>

1:10:19.639 --> 1:10:20.873
<i>Do you miss him?</i>

1:10:21.707 --> 1:10:24.510
Well, I miss
all of the la jolla gang.

1:10:24.543 --> 1:10:26.479
Do you miss Tommy?

1:10:30.182 --> 1:10:33.153
Well, if it weren't for Tommy,
then you and I wouldn't be together.

1:10:33.185 --> 1:10:34.654
That's not true.

1:10:36.756 --> 1:10:40.594
Not true at all.
You and I were friends long before Tommy.

1:10:41.261 --> 1:10:43.930
- Best friends actually.
- Mm-hmm.

1:10:43.962 --> 1:10:48.801
Yes, but Tommy was the
one who got me to see

1:10:48.835 --> 1:10:54.942
that being in love with your
best friend is... is okay.

1:10:55.942 --> 1:10:57.077
Just okay?

1:11:02.481 --> 1:11:06.052
Sometimes
it's a really good thing.

1:11:08.587 --> 1:11:10.423
And I'm so thankful.

1:11:11.457 --> 1:11:13.793
I am so thankful.

1:11:18.230 --> 1:11:21.135
Tommy just always
wanted us to be happy.

1:12:16.021 --> 1:12:18.158
What is it?

1:12:18.190 --> 1:12:21.494
I got a call from this person.
She says I contracted her company

1:12:21.528 --> 1:12:23.530
to keep my memories
safe from time shifts.

1:12:23.563 --> 1:12:25.798
I think it's a scam.
Somebody calls you,

1:12:25.832 --> 1:12:28.635
says she's got your memories,
shows you that little thing

1:12:28.667 --> 1:12:31.280
and tells you how she's gonna get you
more memories as soon as you deposit

1:12:31.304 --> 1:12:33.974
$1000 in a bank account
in the Cayman Islands

1:12:34.006 --> 1:12:36.041
because she's really
an African Princess.

1:12:36.074 --> 1:12:38.286
- Something's not right.
- It's not right because it's a scam.

1:12:38.310 --> 1:12:40.947
I'm starting to feel like I felt,
you know, a couple months ago

1:12:40.979 --> 1:12:43.983
when I was...
Going through stuff.

1:12:44.016 --> 1:12:46.519
When you wanted
to dump your wife?

1:12:46.552 --> 1:12:48.054
When I was unsure about things.

1:12:48.087 --> 1:12:49.957
Things like you wanted
to dump your wife.

1:12:50.823 --> 1:12:52.958
I'm not sure I'm supposed
to be with Alex.

1:12:52.992 --> 1:12:56.563
Oh, my god. You are literally
the noise in the back of my head

1:12:56.595 --> 1:12:58.664
that reminds me why I don't
get into relationships.

1:12:58.698 --> 1:13:00.967
Listen, it's not just me.
It's Alex, too.

1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:02.868
I hear her when she talks
about the past.

1:13:02.902 --> 1:13:05.070
She's not certain she made
the right decision either.

1:13:05.104 --> 1:13:07.807
- I can hear it in her voice.
- You hear what you want to hear

1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:10.610
because your ears are tuned to
the sound of your own bullshit.

1:13:10.643 --> 1:13:13.579
You and Alex are happy together.
I don't understand

1:13:13.613 --> 1:13:16.048
- what's changed.
- No one knows what's changed anymore.

1:13:16.082 --> 1:13:18.059
Yesterday stopped being
yesterday when they figured out

1:13:18.083 --> 1:13:21.153
how to travel through time.
I look at this memory...

1:13:21.186 --> 1:13:23.222
It's not a memory.
It's a video of somebody's head.

1:13:23.256 --> 1:13:25.258
I look at this memory...

1:13:25.291 --> 1:13:28.028
And suddenly my life
doesn't feel right.

1:13:28.060 --> 1:13:30.630
My life was wrecked.
It was wrecked.

1:13:30.662 --> 1:13:32.932
And now it's good and I
wouldn't change it for anything.

1:13:32.966 --> 1:13:36.069
But you did change it. You changed
it because it didn't feel right.

1:13:36.101 --> 1:13:39.104
- You and Alex have been together forever.
- Have we?

1:13:39.137 --> 1:13:42.207
Jesus, Nick!
Since back in la jolla.

1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:43.976
You love Alex.

1:13:44.010 --> 1:13:47.814
- What if I love someone else more?
- Who?

1:13:47.846 --> 1:13:50.182
What is this person's name?
Where are they?

1:13:54.354 --> 1:13:56.256
I want you to tell me
about jaunting.

1:13:58.858 --> 1:13:59.893
Nick.

1:14:01.194 --> 1:14:03.863
I lost my best friend.

1:14:03.895 --> 1:14:05.798
You have your wife.

1:14:06.765 --> 1:14:09.235
What was it like?

1:14:18.744 --> 1:14:23.115
It's expensive.
Really expensive.

1:14:24.951 --> 1:14:29.922
But they can send you
wherever you wanna go.

1:14:29.956 --> 1:14:33.226
They can send you within seconds
of whenever you wanna be,

1:14:33.259 --> 1:14:35.828
whatever period,
correct things you need,

1:14:35.862 --> 1:14:38.664
whatever it takes to blend
in, they can make it happen.

1:14:38.698 --> 1:14:42.302
There are a lot of rules,
but it's like everything else.

1:14:42.335 --> 1:14:45.739
You pay enough money,
you can pretty much do what you want.

1:14:51.743 --> 1:14:55.247
What if you go back and change your
past but you end up with no future?

1:14:57.050 --> 1:15:00.753
If you do change the past,
I won't know what happened or why.

1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:05.891
So I need you to remember
that I love you.

1:15:07.025 --> 1:15:08.894
And I'll always be here for you.

1:15:12.465 --> 1:15:14.434
<i>- Where would you like to go?
- La jolla.</i>

1:15:14.466 --> 1:15:16.268
<i>- When?
- When do I want to go?</i>

1:15:16.301 --> 1:15:17.903
<i>No, when do you want to be?</i>

1:15:17.936 --> 1:15:19.805
<i>You can be anytime you care to.</i>

1:15:20.338 --> 1:15:22.274
Thirteen years ago.

1:15:22.307 --> 1:15:24.444
Any historical events
you wanted to witness?

1:15:24.476 --> 1:15:26.979
- Any individuals of significance?
- No, no.

1:15:27.012 --> 1:15:29.783
Just want a straightforward
time travel experience.

1:15:29.815 --> 1:15:35.255
I want to go to la jolla.
I had some friends there at the time.

1:15:35.287 --> 1:15:36.288
Good friends.

1:15:37.422 --> 1:15:39.358
<i>Every Friday night my friends</i>

1:15:39.391 --> 1:15:41.760
<i>would throw
a party on the beach.</i>

1:15:41.793 --> 1:15:43.829
<i>You know, bonfire, red wine.</i>

1:15:43.863 --> 1:15:45.865
<i>There was this one Friday
I couldn't go.</i>

1:15:45.898 --> 1:15:50.103
I was... sick.

1:15:51.738 --> 1:15:53.840
Really sick and...

1:15:55.975 --> 1:15:58.979
I knew my friends were down at
the beach having a great time.

1:16:00.813 --> 1:16:03.083
And I was in my apartment...

1:16:04.783 --> 1:16:07.286
Cold sweat, body aches.

1:16:10.523 --> 1:16:12.225
And I felt so alone.

1:16:16.762 --> 1:16:18.230
Never felt so alone.

1:16:21.333 --> 1:16:23.804
<i>I didn't like the feeling.</i>

1:16:26.939 --> 1:16:28.809
<i>And I didn't wanna feel
alone anymore.</i>

1:16:30.176 --> 1:16:37.317
<i>It was after that that my wife and I
started to think about... getting serious.</i>

1:16:47.493 --> 1:16:48.795
That's when...

1:16:51.396 --> 1:16:52.899
That's when I wanna be.

1:16:53.932 --> 1:16:59.805
Well, I can book you into
our comfort economy excursion.

1:16:59.838 --> 1:17:01.807
The entire trip would be
limited to one full day,

1:17:01.841 --> 1:17:04.944
so extraction would be
required after 24 hours,

1:17:04.976 --> 1:17:09.047
and your personal travel radius
would be limited to 20 miles.

1:17:09.081 --> 1:17:11.384
Your total cost would be...

1:17:18.490 --> 1:17:20.327
Did you want me
to go ahead and book you?

1:17:33.171 --> 1:17:36.542
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.

1:17:41.046 --> 1:17:44.216
- Not going in today?
- Going in late.

1:17:44.250 --> 1:17:46.953
Hmm.

1:17:47.619 --> 1:17:51.557
Okay.

1:17:53.559 --> 1:17:55.128
Bye. See you later.

1:17:59.030 --> 1:18:02.836
Bye, Charlie. Bye, baby.
See you later, too.

1:18:03.903 --> 1:18:05.238
Alex, hey.

1:18:16.181 --> 1:18:18.284
I always just wanted you
to be happy.

1:18:23.521 --> 1:18:24.957
You're funny.

1:18:27.659 --> 1:18:30.896
Bye.

1:18:38.270 --> 1:18:40.038
<i>Are you currently
unwell or have you required</i>

1:18:40.072 --> 1:18:41.875
<i>hospital treatment
in the last year?</i>

1:18:41.908 --> 1:18:44.244
- No.
- Do you have a disability or has anyone advised

1:18:44.277 --> 1:18:47.188
you might have a medical condition that
could affect your fitness to travel?

1:18:47.212 --> 1:18:49.381
<i>- No.
- Do you currently have any medical problems</i>

1:18:49.414 --> 1:18:51.917
<i>- including mental health problems?
- No.</i>

1:18:51.951 --> 1:18:53.594
<i>Do you ever suffer
from motion sickness, vertigo</i>

1:18:53.618 --> 1:18:55.354
<i>- or labyrinthitis?
- No.</i>

1:18:55.387 --> 1:18:56.521
<i>Emergency contact.</i>

1:18:56.555 --> 1:18:57.891
<i>Zoe mikkelsen.</i>

1:18:57.923 --> 1:18:58.957
<i>What relation?</i>

1:18:58.990 --> 1:19:01.060
She's my sister.

1:19:01.092 --> 1:19:03.930
This is
our terms of service agreement.

1:19:03.962 --> 1:19:07.065
It says that you have read and will
adhere to all travel restrictions

1:19:07.099 --> 1:19:10.203
<i>and will refrain from engaging
in any prohibited activity,</i>

1:19:10.235 --> 1:19:14.039
<i>including but not limited
to time track alterations,</i>

1:19:14.073 --> 1:19:16.075
<i>willful reorientation
of significant events,</i>

1:19:16.108 --> 1:19:18.677
<i>and historical manipulations
for personal gain.</i>

1:19:18.711 --> 1:19:21.114
<i>If I can just get you
to sign the bottom for me?</i>

1:19:22.347 --> 1:19:25.085
- And how will you be paying?
- Bank transfer.

1:19:28.287 --> 1:19:30.523
<i>Your transfer is completed.</i>

1:19:30.555 --> 1:19:34.124
<i>We're all set.</i>

1:19:34.659 --> 1:19:37.162
Let's see what the past
has waiting for you.

1:19:45.237 --> 1:19:47.007
Have a seat, Mr. Mikkelsen.

1:19:51.510 --> 1:19:53.445
If you could please
drink the liquid for me.

1:19:59.185 --> 1:20:01.488
I'll need you to drink
the entire glass.

1:20:10.662 --> 1:20:13.065
And just go ahead
and lie back for me.

1:20:18.604 --> 1:20:20.273
Perfect.

1:20:23.341 --> 1:20:25.577
Have a wonderful trip,
Mr. Mikkelsen.

1:20:34.653 --> 1:20:38.490
Good afternoon, Mr. Mikkelsen.
Can you hear me okay?

1:20:38.524 --> 1:20:40.493
- Yeah.
- My name's Steven

1:20:40.525 --> 1:20:43.162
and I'm gonna be
your travel technician today.

1:20:44.063 --> 1:20:46.766
- Hello, Steven.
- You're okay with that liquid?

1:20:46.798 --> 1:20:50.036
- You're not feeling any nausea? Any upset stomach?
- No.

1:20:50.069 --> 1:20:52.205
- Good.
- What was in that actually? They didn't...

1:20:52.238 --> 1:20:55.441
You're going to hear
me count from ten to zero.

1:20:55.474 --> 1:20:58.578
Really there's nothing much
you need to do, except relax

1:20:58.610 --> 1:21:01.347
and enjoy yourself
when you arrive.

1:21:05.784 --> 1:21:07.019
Okay.

1:21:07.854 --> 1:21:10.256
Have a good trip.

1:21:11.423 --> 1:21:12.591
Ten.

1:21:13.458 --> 1:21:14.560
Nine.

1:21:15.194 --> 1:21:16.229
Eight.

1:21:17.462 --> 1:21:18.597
Seven.

1:21:19.431 --> 1:21:20.567
Six.

1:21:22.467 --> 1:21:24.237
Mr. Mikkelsen.

1:21:24.270 --> 1:21:26.739
It's very important
that you relax.

1:21:26.771 --> 1:21:29.676
You can't travel
until you're relaxed.

1:21:35.280 --> 1:21:36.314
That's fine.

1:21:36.347 --> 1:21:37.684
Here we go.

1:21:38.751 --> 1:21:39.786
Ten.

1:21:40.853 --> 1:21:42.087
Nine.

1:21:43.255 --> 1:21:44.289
Eight.

1:21:45.091 --> 1:21:46.192
Seven.

1:21:46.826 --> 1:21:48.060
Six.

1:21:48.726 --> 1:21:49.762
Five.

1:21:50.628 --> 1:21:51.663
Four.

1:21:52.331 --> 1:21:53.365
Three.

1:21:54.432 --> 1:21:55.467
Two.

1:22:00.605 --> 1:22:03.175
<i>What the past has for you.</i>

1:22:03.208 --> 1:22:07.512
<i>- Mr. Mikkelsen, relax.
- Love... form of a circle... a circle...</i>

1:22:07.546 --> 1:22:09.315
<i>- Hey, Nick!
- Hey!</i>

1:22:52.390 --> 1:22:54.326
Hey, Nick.

1:22:54.359 --> 1:22:55.627
Hey!

1:23:00.466 --> 1:23:01.501
Hi.

1:23:04.235 --> 1:23:05.546
I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

1:23:05.570 --> 1:23:07.206
Alex said
you weren't feeling well.

1:23:07.238 --> 1:23:08.840
I got over it.

1:23:08.873 --> 1:23:10.208
Come and get a glass of wine...

1:23:10.242 --> 1:23:11.878
Hey, Tommy, one sec.

1:23:11.911 --> 1:23:14.146
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

1:23:17.582 --> 1:23:19.219
I'm breaking up with Alex.

1:23:20.618 --> 1:23:22.521
Tonight? Why?

1:23:24.489 --> 1:23:26.626
Things aren't quite
right between us

1:23:26.658 --> 1:23:30.629
and I think I owe it to her
before it goes too far.

1:23:32.297 --> 1:23:34.567
Well, I don't know what to say.

1:23:34.600 --> 1:23:36.560
I thought you two were
the most solid couple here.

1:23:38.369 --> 1:23:42.375
We were. But I think it's over.

1:23:47.746 --> 1:23:50.315
Tommy, I know you like Alex.

1:23:50.349 --> 1:23:54.854
She's... she's a good person, I mean...
She's a good friend.

1:23:54.886 --> 1:23:56.855
Maybe she's your best friend.

1:23:59.757 --> 1:24:03.829
She sees things in you
I never saw. She...

1:24:05.530 --> 1:24:08.333
She's been there for you
in ways I haven't.

1:24:10.668 --> 1:24:13.739
- I've been a real dick, man.
- What are you talking about?

1:24:15.474 --> 1:24:18.444
Taking you for granted.
Our friendship.

1:24:18.476 --> 1:24:21.713
- We've always been cool.
- We've been cool because...

1:24:21.747 --> 1:24:25.585
I was always cool
with taking while you gave.

1:24:26.918 --> 1:24:28.220
Alex...

1:24:30.389 --> 1:24:33.326
Helped me understand
how that must make you feel.

1:24:35.426 --> 1:24:37.929
She really cares
about you, and I think

1:24:37.962 --> 1:24:40.899
if it wasn't for me,
you two might be together.

1:24:42.033 --> 1:24:46.004
So... so I'm gonna take
myself out of the picture.

1:24:46.037 --> 1:24:49.708
I have no idea what Alex
is gonna think about it

1:24:49.742 --> 1:24:54.012
or what she's going to feel,
but if she still cares what I think,

1:24:54.046 --> 1:24:58.784
I'm going to tell her that you are
absolutely the best person she could find.

1:25:00.551 --> 1:25:01.820
And that's the truth.

1:25:16.868 --> 1:25:18.637
Me and Donna and Tate...

1:25:20.939 --> 1:25:25.578
We never cared who your dad was
or how much money you had.

1:25:25.610 --> 1:25:27.247
You're our friend.

1:25:28.380 --> 1:25:29.681
And we love you.

1:25:31.582 --> 1:25:32.751
We just want...

1:25:36.755 --> 1:25:41.527
I just want... you to be happy.

1:25:49.501 --> 1:25:50.536
Both of you.

1:26:27.773 --> 1:26:29.375
That sounds like a good idea.

1:28:58.856 --> 1:29:01.761
Mr. Mikkelsen. Are you with us?

1:29:03.595 --> 1:29:04.864
Welcome back.

1:29:06.631 --> 1:29:07.699
How was your trip?

1:29:08.266 --> 1:29:10.635
I don't feel well.

1:29:10.668 --> 1:29:14.073
Nausea, disorientation and some
memory loss are common side effects.

1:29:14.105 --> 1:29:16.108
I'm going to walk you
to our arrivals lounge.

1:29:16.140 --> 1:29:17.942
You can rest there
for as long as you like.

1:29:17.975 --> 1:29:19.711
When you're ready,
you can head home.

1:29:23.649 --> 1:29:24.851
Okay.

1:31:32.711 --> 1:31:35.180
<i>What we want to
accomplish in our next pass</i>

1:31:35.212 --> 1:31:39.183
is to make allowances for the
outcome of our planning stages.

1:31:39.216 --> 1:31:42.387
Have we taken into consideration
environmental impact?

1:31:42.421 --> 1:31:46.158
Have we really thought through the
cause and effect of our choices?

1:31:46.190 --> 1:31:48.327
Within a design itself,

1:31:48.359 --> 1:31:52.230
how are we allowing for
fluctuations in human density...

1:32:56.962 --> 1:32:58.397
Come on. You're going out.

1:32:59.564 --> 1:33:02.201
- I don't really feel like it.
- I don't care how you feel.

1:33:02.234 --> 1:33:04.870
Let me tell you how you look.
You look like shit.

1:33:05.436 --> 1:33:06.738
We're going out.

1:33:27.926 --> 1:33:28.961
Wow.

1:33:33.297 --> 1:33:34.766
It's really wonderful, Zoe.

1:33:34.800 --> 1:33:37.936
Happy birthday.
Sibila picked it out.

1:33:38.737 --> 1:33:40.372
The guy at the shop
said it still works.

1:33:40.404 --> 1:33:42.307
I had him put
some batteries in it.

1:33:45.476 --> 1:33:46.511
Thank you.

1:33:51.248 --> 1:33:56.354
Me and sibila are going cliff
diving this weekend. Wanna come?

1:33:56.387 --> 1:33:59.190
Cliff diving, nah.

1:34:01.893 --> 1:34:04.829
It's your birthday.
You should do something.

1:34:04.863 --> 1:34:08.267
I think I'm just
gonna take it easy.

1:34:12.270 --> 1:34:15.040
Well, how about we at least
take you out to dinner?

1:34:15.073 --> 1:34:18.076
You guys have plans.

1:34:18.109 --> 1:34:20.946
- We can dive some other weekend.
- You should go.

1:34:22.314 --> 1:34:23.414
Have fun.

1:34:24.314 --> 1:34:26.884
It's your birthday.
You should have fun.

1:34:26.917 --> 1:34:28.853
I got something I'm gonna do.

1:34:30.154 --> 1:34:31.456
Something what?

1:34:52.476 --> 1:34:53.511
Zoe.

1:34:55.613 --> 1:34:56.848
Yeah?

1:35:01.453 --> 1:35:03.489
Have I always been lonely?

1:35:24.975 --> 1:35:27.045
This is
really hard for me, Nick.

1:35:28.913 --> 1:35:32.416
I spent a lot of years
just watching you

1:35:32.449 --> 1:35:35.987
collapse on yourself
and I don't know why.

1:35:38.523 --> 1:35:40.226
I just want it to stop.

1:35:41.393 --> 1:35:43.095
I just want you to be happy.

1:35:52.636 --> 1:35:55.206
What about your friends
from la jolla?

1:35:55.239 --> 1:35:57.509
You don't talk to them anymore?

1:35:57.542 --> 1:35:59.311
No. We all just...

1:36:00.979 --> 1:36:03.414
I don't know,
went our separate ways.

1:36:08.420 --> 1:36:11.690
Maybe you should get a pet.
What about a dog?

1:36:11.722 --> 1:36:14.393
- I don't want a dog.
- You've always wanted a dog.

1:36:15.327 --> 1:36:16.362
I think that...

1:36:18.095 --> 1:36:21.599
A cat would be
easier to take care of.

1:36:21.632 --> 1:36:23.101
Maybe I'll get a cat.

1:36:34.279 --> 1:36:36.582
You are a great sister, Zoe.

1:36:41.252 --> 1:36:43.155
Best one I could've asked for.

1:37:22.092 --> 1:37:24.662
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Nick.</i>

1:37:24.695 --> 1:37:25.997
<i>It's Tommy Hambleton.</i>

1:37:26.430 --> 1:37:28.265
Tommy?

1:37:28.298 --> 1:37:30.601
<i>Yeah. It's been a minute, huh?</i>

1:37:30.635 --> 1:37:34.306
Yeah. I was just telling
Zoe that I never get to

1:37:34.338 --> 1:37:37.708
talk to the old la jolla gang
anymore, really.

1:37:37.742 --> 1:37:40.546
<i>Nick, I'm not gonna lie.
Zoe called.</i>

1:37:41.546 --> 1:37:43.115
<i>She's worried about you.</i>

1:37:46.150 --> 1:37:48.753
- Yeah, well, Zoe worries too much.
- <i>She's your sister.</i>

1:37:48.787 --> 1:37:51.789
<i>How is she not gonna worry?
It's your birthday.</i>

1:37:51.823 --> 1:37:54.593
<i>She said all you got planned is
to sit around your apartment.</i>

1:37:55.359 --> 1:37:57.395
<i>Look, we're having some drinks,</i>

1:37:57.429 --> 1:37:59.197
<i>some people
getting together at the loft.</i>

1:37:59.229 --> 1:38:01.198
- <i>You remember the loft.</i>
- Yeah.

1:38:01.231 --> 1:38:03.268
<i>We're celebrating
Tate and Donna's anniversary.</i>

1:38:03.301 --> 1:38:05.337
<i>Just some drinks,
nothing too fancy.</i>

1:38:05.369 --> 1:38:06.704
Tate and Donna.

1:38:10.108 --> 1:38:11.610
I, um...

1:38:12.844 --> 1:38:16.480
- I think I'll pass.
- <i>Nick.</i>

1:38:16.514 --> 1:38:19.551
<i>It's not my business,
but whatever you're going through,</i>

1:38:19.583 --> 1:38:21.487
<i>you don't have to go
through it on your own.</i>

1:38:22.488 --> 1:38:24.789
<i>Just come and hang out
for a couple of hours.</i>

1:38:27.559 --> 1:38:28.594
<i>An hour.</i>

1:38:30.228 --> 1:38:34.099
<i>One drink, then you can go.</i>

1:38:36.634 --> 1:38:41.073
- Yeah, okay. I'll stop by.
- <i>Great, 8:00. See you there.</i>

1:38:57.788 --> 1:38:59.323
Nick. Nick.

1:39:00.125 --> 1:39:01.159
Nick!

1:39:03.728 --> 1:39:06.664
- You made it.
- Yeah, I told you I would.

1:39:06.698 --> 1:39:08.467
I'm glad you did.
It's been way too long.

1:39:08.500 --> 1:39:10.167
You look good man, really.

1:39:10.201 --> 1:39:11.879
Zoe told me you kind of
look like shit right now.

1:39:11.903 --> 1:39:15.307
And you really are a little
on the shitty-looking side.

1:39:15.340 --> 1:39:16.542
Yeah, well...

1:39:18.510 --> 1:39:22.181
Look. I don't know
how to say this.

1:39:25.250 --> 1:39:27.685
We're concerned about you.
I'm concerned about you.

1:39:27.719 --> 1:39:31.389
- You shouldn't be.
- You were my best friend.

1:39:31.421 --> 1:39:34.525
How can I not be? Every good thing
I have in my life is because of you.

1:39:34.559 --> 1:39:37.229
I think you were doing all
right before you met me.

1:39:37.261 --> 1:39:38.296
I mean it.

1:39:39.163 --> 1:39:42.634
These past few years
have been the best.

1:39:44.502 --> 1:39:46.705
My father retired.

1:39:46.738 --> 1:39:50.708
He put all this pressure on me to take
over the company, but I couldn't do it.

1:39:50.742 --> 1:39:53.345
I knew I wasn't gonna have
one happy day at that place.

1:39:55.613 --> 1:39:57.516
So I started my own business.

1:39:58.917 --> 1:40:00.752
It's a lot smaller, it's a lot.

1:40:02.252 --> 1:40:03.287
But i'm...

1:40:06.858 --> 1:40:10.328
I'm happy with what I'm doing.
And I'm happy.

1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:12.697
I'm happy in myself
and that's because of you.

1:40:12.729 --> 1:40:15.266
You're the one who told me
to be good with who I am.

1:40:16.568 --> 1:40:17.668
Nick, we miss you.

1:40:17.702 --> 1:40:20.372
We just want you to be happy.

1:40:22.907 --> 1:40:24.143
Nick!

1:40:25.542 --> 1:40:27.945
- It's been forever.
- How you doing, Donna?

1:40:27.979 --> 1:40:30.215
- How are you?
- I'm well.

1:40:30.247 --> 1:40:33.484
- Mm-hmm. You sure? You look like shit.
- I'm all right.

1:40:35.286 --> 1:40:37.531
Alex, I just need to steal your
husband just for one minute.

1:40:37.555 --> 1:40:39.423
- Oh. Okay.
- Come, come, come.

1:40:40.858 --> 1:40:44.296
- Do not let this man leave.
- I won't.

1:40:48.332 --> 1:40:50.434
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:40:53.671 --> 1:40:54.773
How are you?

1:40:57.574 --> 1:40:59.711
Everybody says I look
like shit, so...

1:41:00.545 --> 1:41:04.716
Nothing a little smile
wouldn't cure.

1:41:04.748 --> 1:41:08.819
Mm? You already look better.

1:41:11.421 --> 1:41:12.890
We all miss seeing you, Nick.

1:41:17.828 --> 1:41:20.231
Do you stay away because of me?

1:41:24.402 --> 1:41:25.436
Look.

1:41:26.304 --> 1:41:30.208
I was really hurt
when you broke things off.

1:41:31.442 --> 1:41:32.644
I really was.

1:41:34.845 --> 1:41:40.384
But over time,
I think you were right.

1:41:40.417 --> 1:41:43.822
You know, we could've kept going

1:41:43.854 --> 1:41:46.958
one year, five years maybe.

1:41:47.826 --> 1:41:50.996
I... I don't know
if you would've lasted.

1:41:55.766 --> 1:42:02.273
And, um... if we hadn't broken
up, I wouldn't be with Tommy.

1:42:02.306 --> 1:42:04.009
And if...

1:42:04.042 --> 1:42:06.511
And if I wasn't with Tommy...

1:42:24.561 --> 1:42:26.998
Hey. Hey.

1:42:30.335 --> 1:42:31.869
Don't regret the past.

1:42:33.604 --> 1:42:36.975
Yeah, the past is what brings
us to where we need to be.

1:42:47.685 --> 1:42:49.788
We've missed you so much, Nick.

1:42:53.557 --> 1:42:55.694
Alex, come get a picture!

1:42:57.862 --> 1:43:00.465
Ah. I need to go.

1:43:02.033 --> 1:43:03.735
It's so good to see you.
