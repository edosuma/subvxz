WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:03.971
And we know how excited you are
to go to college,

00:04.004 --> 00:04.972
and we're excited
for you,

00:05.005 --> 00:06.740
but the school's position
is that

00:06.774 --> 00:08.576
you cannot graduate
this year.

00:08.609 --> 00:09.977
There were
some absences

00:10.010 --> 00:12.580
related to medical procedures
and therapies.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.382
Some grades could be higher,
but, you know,

00:14.415 --> 00:16.817
you just started at
a mainstream school last year.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.519
You know,
that's their position,

00:18.552 --> 00:20.254
and...
they're adamant.

00:23.191 --> 00:27.228
"What are you going to do
about it, Mommy?"

00:28.762 --> 00:30.531
I thought
you'd never bloody ask.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.733
Should I put on
the theme music to "Kill Bill"?

00:32.766 --> 00:34.535
Or is it already playing
in your head?

00:34.568 --> 00:35.269
Yeah!

00:37.605 --> 00:39.373
Unacceptable, Dr. Miller.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.874
Unacceptable, Dr. Miller!

00:40.908 --> 00:42.610
Bloody unacceptable,
Dr. Miller!

00:42.643 --> 00:44.545
I understand, but...

00:44.578 --> 00:46.080
I understand, but...

00:46.114 --> 00:47.381
I understand, but...

00:47.415 --> 00:49.750
Hey!
That's too funny, isn't it?

00:49.783 --> 00:51.352
We're getting ready
for the same fight.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.953
I'll see you there.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.457
Where are you going? Why are you
running away from me?

00:56.490 --> 00:58.058
Coward!
It's true --
I am a coward.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.128
The coward who cares --
that's my brand,

01:00.161 --> 01:02.062
and my track record
of standing up to you is...

01:02.096 --> 01:03.431
not good.

01:03.464 --> 01:06.234
But this is too important,
so I've brought reinforcements.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.802
These are JJ's teachers.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.139
They will attest
that JJ has not completed

01:11.172 --> 01:12.873
the work necessary
to graduate.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.142
If you wanted
to challenge that,

01:14.175 --> 01:16.076
you would have to go
through all of us.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.812
Let's do it.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.814
JJ needs to make up
nine gym classes.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.616
He'll do three gym classes,
no dodgeball.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.318
Four gym classes.
Give me dodgeball.

01:25.619 --> 01:26.987
What will it take
for JJ to pass English?

01:27.020 --> 01:28.589
He needs to read
two Shakespeare plays.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.890
Not gonna happen.
One Shakespeare play.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.091
Sorry.
My screenplay?

01:31.125 --> 01:32.059
Is it good?
It's long.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.294
Cut 10 pages,
and we'll talk.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.164
JJ will not pass French.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.731
JJ wil pass French,

01:37.765 --> 01:40.268
'cause you don't actually care
and you hate your job.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.170
Au revoir.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.172
You're a math teacher.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.439
Here's some math for you.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.241
Three...two --

01:47.275 --> 01:48.576
I'll pass him!

01:51.945 --> 01:54.348
Maya, it might be possible
to squeeze a passing grade

01:54.382 --> 01:56.150
out of
each of these teachers,

01:56.184 --> 01:58.186
but to graduate JJ
before he's ready

01:58.219 --> 02:00.521
wouldn't be the right thing
for him.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.723
So I won't allow it.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.595
I suppose
that's that, then.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.097
Yes. Now please leave
so I can collapse in peace.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.765
Yeah.

02:11.799 --> 02:12.800
Oh, God.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.869
-- Captions by VITAC --

02:17.971 --> 02:20.208
Oh, you guys are back from
the JJ meeting

02:20.241 --> 02:21.842
Oh, your mom likes to do
those things alone.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.111
There's a very clear division
of labor in this family.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.813
So what do you do?
What do you do?!

02:25.846 --> 02:27.448
Sorry. Lot going on.
Tough day.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.649
She's back.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.050
And she won.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.953
Time for my traditional
Mom victory marshmallow.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.288
I didn't win.
You lost?

02:34.322 --> 02:37.358
What do we do? We don't have
a tradition for that.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.193
Marshmallows aren't
a tradition either, Ray.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.861
Nobody knows
why you do it.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.863
I couldn't change
their minds.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.699
Those fools are insisting
he do another year.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.368
Are we sure
they're wrong?

02:47.401 --> 02:48.969
I mean,
I know how you get

02:49.002 --> 02:51.004
whenever anyone says
the words...

02:52.506 --> 02:53.841
I-I'm gonna say it
from back here.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.676
..."JJ can't,"

02:55.709 --> 02:58.712
but should we consider that
maybe this isn't one to fight?

02:59.947 --> 03:00.681
Maya?

03:00.714 --> 03:01.915
Say "JJ can't" again.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.421
Aw, darling.
I'm sorry.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.923
I -- I tried.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.560
They just don't think
you're ready to graduate.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.662
Jimmy:
"Then, I'm done there.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.497
I can't face them.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.466
I'm not going back."

03:19.567 --> 03:21.635
I'm so sorry.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.574
Okay, buddy.
Let's get you to school.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.510
Don't want to late.
It is this time.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.878
Blam!

03:30.911 --> 03:32.112
I know --
it's an extravagance,

03:32.145 --> 03:34.682
but, as the guy
at the watch store said,

03:34.715 --> 03:36.450
"Are you sure
you can afford this?"

03:37.485 --> 03:39.353
Huh?

03:39.387 --> 03:41.355
Lafayette's not gonna
let him graduate this year.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.857
He's decided not to go back.
You may or may not have a job.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.493
Oh, no, buddy.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.429
Uh...

03:48.462 --> 03:50.230
**

03:50.264 --> 03:52.533
You guys want
to buy this kid a watch?

03:52.566 --> 03:54.134
**

03:54.167 --> 03:55.769
Teacher:
On to our next demonstration --

03:55.803 --> 03:58.105
gas visualization
through thermal imaging.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.707
Now, everyone,
watch closely.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.141
When Ray pops the balloon,

04:01.174 --> 04:03.143
the heated gas inside
will disperse.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.144
Three, two --

04:06.914 --> 04:08.582
That's odd.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.984
We didn't pop the balloon,
but there still seems to be

04:11.018 --> 04:13.387
a hot gas in the air
near Ray's pants.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.122
Great demonstration.
I'll go sit down now.

04:15.155 --> 04:18.959
Curious. Any hypotheses
on the strange gas around Ray?

04:18.992 --> 04:20.428
Ray farted.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.097
Yes!
That would do it.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.799
**

04:25.833 --> 04:27.501
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.902
How's JJ holding up?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.238
He's been better,
but Pepper's right.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.207
It's really no problem that
a big pile of belts won't fit.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.312
I met with Dr. Miller
to ask if I would still get paid

04:38.346 --> 04:40.314
to assist JJ
while he's not at school.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.516
Got to hear her real laugh
for the first time.

04:42.550 --> 04:43.917
That was fun.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.185
I'm gonna
have to sell some stuff

04:45.218 --> 04:47.020
just to pay
this dumb thing off.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.790
Ugh! Goodbye,
rare baseball card collection.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.326
Hello, ex-wife
who has them at her house.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.794
The ex-wife
who burned all your stuff?

04:53.827 --> 04:55.963
No. The mean one.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.766
She did not
want to get a divorce.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.802
She's gonna be
all over me.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.637
Wish I could avoid
the whole thing.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.272
Just don't have
much of a cushion.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.107
Yeah, really makes you wonder
where the phrase

05:07.140 --> 05:10.711
"as rich as a public school
aide" comes from.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.814
All right, ladies, votes for
team captain have been tallied.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.148
Oh, yeah.

05:15.182 --> 05:17.117
Now, I don't want to get
into one of those situations

05:17.150 --> 05:19.387
where I say "And your new
team captain is..."

05:19.420 --> 05:21.221
and then the wrong person
stands up

05:21.254 --> 05:22.890
'cause they were sure
they were gonna win.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.893
So even if you think you're
about to be named captain,

05:25.926 --> 05:27.695
don't stand up,
'cause you didn't win.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.062
Capisce?

05:29.096 --> 05:30.197
Your new team captain
is --

05:30.230 --> 05:30.998
Thank you!

05:31.031 --> 05:32.299
...Alicia Hernandez.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.300
Damn it, Dylan!

05:33.333 --> 05:34.468
What?!

05:34.502 --> 05:36.236
I'm faster than Alicia.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.838
I'm faster than
all of you.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.873
Why didn't you dumb losers
vote for me?

05:39.907 --> 05:41.008
Your answer's
in your question.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.309
No riddles, Barry.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.644
I think people felt

05:43.677 --> 05:46.079
Alicia displays
better sportsmanship than you.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.049
Of all the times
to come in second!

05:49.082 --> 05:50.918
**

05:52.219 --> 05:53.754
You didn't
come in second.

05:53.787 --> 05:57.491
Get in, get the baseball cards,
get out.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.026
Kenneth,
do not be beautiful.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.731
You just don't listen,
you sexy devil.

06:03.764 --> 06:08.201
**

06:08.235 --> 06:10.170
Robin. Hello.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.706
Kenneth. It is so good
to see you.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.741
You can smile?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.910
I know we didn't end
on the best terms.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.278
I'm in
a better place now.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.447
Your stuff's inside.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.249
**

06:22.282 --> 06:23.383
Wha--

06:23.417 --> 06:25.218
This is you?

06:25.252 --> 06:27.755
Wow. You're in
a much better place.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.057
Well, come on. Let's catch up.
I'll open the good wine.

06:30.090 --> 06:33.093
**

06:33.126 --> 06:34.462
Well, I do
like the good wine.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.564
JJ. Good news.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.365
I found a school
that is up to the task

06:38.398 --> 06:40.400
of helping you graduate
this year.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.735
"What's the school?"

06:41.769 --> 06:43.637
Would you like to meet
the headmistress?

06:43.671 --> 06:45.105
She's just back there.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.508
Word of warning --
she got a bit of a funny voice.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.544
Hello, JJ.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.813
My name is
Miss Rona McDuff,

06:52.846 --> 06:55.649
and I am so excited
to be working with you.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.317
Now, was that an excuse

06:57.350 --> 06:59.553
to show you that I'm gorgeous
as a blonde?

06:59.587 --> 07:02.222
No. It was, though,
a dramatic way of revealing

07:02.255 --> 07:06.293
that I am the headmistress
of DiMeo Academy.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.028
And class is now
in session.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.431
Also, ,
I'm gorgeous as a redhead.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.169
I did my research.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.337
If we follow
a registered online curriculum,

07:17.370 --> 07:19.339
you can get enough credits
to graduate this year.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.775
Boom! Victory marshmallow
is a thing now.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.911
No? All right.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.279
"They said
I couldn't do it."

07:26.313 --> 07:28.682
Yeah. So now we fight.
Did you just meet me?

07:28.716 --> 07:30.784
"You can't be
my teacher.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.287
You don't know"... C-H-E --
"chemistry or French."

07:34.321 --> 07:35.623
Well, that's where
you're wrong.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.958
See, Mrs. DiMeo doesn't need
to know everything.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.327
She just needs to know
one chapter more than you.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.862
And as of last night,
she does.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.798
Alors. Si tu as fini
de déconner,

07:44.832 --> 07:47.100
il faut que nous nous mettons
au travail.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.268
**

07:48.301 --> 07:49.537
Allons-freakin'-sy.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.371
**

07:51.404 --> 07:53.140
Fart Guy!
Look at them,
mocking me.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.943
They all know
I wasn't named captain.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.110
Is there
any greater shame?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.311
None that
I can think of.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.447
Hey, look who it is!
What up, Fart Guy?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.115
I'm not Fart Guy!

08:02.149 --> 08:04.685
I'm just a girl
who wasn't named captain!

08:04.718 --> 08:06.620
Why do they
keep calling me that?

08:06.654 --> 08:08.522
It's not you.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.991
In class yesterday,
I...

08:11.024 --> 08:12.259
I-I dealt it.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.329
Ugh!
Stupid track team!

08:16.363 --> 08:18.866
I'm so mad,
I can't even enjoy that.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.903
Well,
this is the place --

08:22.936 --> 08:26.640
all mine now
after a pretty brutal divorce.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.577
This is my third one.
Getting pretty good at it.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.678
So, what have you
been up to?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.580
Uh, not much.

08:32.613 --> 08:36.349
Say, is that one of those, uh,
wine

08:36.383 --> 08:38.085
Yeah.
Help yourself.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.089
It's like one of those
soft-serve machines

08:42.122 --> 08:43.323
that get you drunk!

08:43.356 --> 08:44.658
Hi!

08:44.692 --> 08:47.160
Oh. You give your dog
bottled water?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.929
Man,
that divorce worked out well.

08:48.962 --> 08:52.332
What can I say?
I'm attracted to successful men.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.934
You always have been.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.771
You're funny,
Kenneth.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.907
Oh.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.242
You don't think
I'm successful?

09:02.275 --> 09:04.678
I saw your car,

09:04.712 --> 09:06.714
you were wearing the same shirt
the day we met,

09:06.747 --> 09:08.415
and you're here
for your baseball cards,

09:08.448 --> 09:10.250
which reminds me...

09:11.752 --> 09:13.587
So great seeing you,
Kenneth.

09:13.621 --> 09:14.955
**

09:14.988 --> 09:16.890
Right, in order for you
to graduate this year,

09:16.924 --> 09:19.459
we've got a lot of ground
to cover and not a lot of time.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.294
So, in the interest
of efficiency,

09:21.328 --> 09:24.397
we're gonna do a little bit
of physics-French-geometry now.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.933
"What's with the"...
B"

09:25.966 --> 09:27.567
Oh, excellent question.
We'll also be doing gym.

09:28.501 --> 09:31.138
So, if energy goes
as velocity squared,

09:31.171 --> 09:35.375
in the game of football,
if I kick you two times faster,

09:35.408 --> 09:37.277
the pain you experience
will be...

09:40.447 --> 09:42.149
"Four times more."

09:42.182 --> 09:43.550
Yes! Exactly!

09:43.583 --> 09:46.720
I'm looking
for DiMeo Academy.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.990
Ah! Guest history lecturer --
World War II.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.591
We'll throw some history
on, too.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.826
Start talking, sir.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.261
Uh...

09:54.294 --> 09:56.730
The year was 1941.

09:56.764 --> 09:57.798
Kick and talk.
Kick and talk.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.466
I was sitting
in the front room...

09:59.499 --> 10:01.301
Kick and talk.
...and I was listening
to the radio.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.406
Aren't you kids gonna ask JJ
how school was today?

10:06.439 --> 10:07.574
JJ didn't go to school.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.942
Yes, he did.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.611
Today was his first day
at DiMeo Academy.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.814
Wait.
You started a school?

10:13.847 --> 10:15.315
"It's"...G-R --
"great."

10:16.216 --> 10:17.484
Good enough for me.
I'm in.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.585
Are you

10:18.618 --> 10:21.321
Kids my age are
extremely immature

10:21.354 --> 10:23.691
about a perfectly normal
bodily function.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.326
Look, I work hard, and I listen
to what the teachers say.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.360
Do you want me or not?

10:27.394 --> 10:28.962
You know what?

10:28.996 --> 10:30.630
Another student could
spice up the soccer team.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.199
Does this school have
a track team?

10:32.232 --> 10:34.534
Follow-up question --
could that track team compete

10:34.567 --> 10:36.704
with the Lafayette losers
at the meet this week?

10:36.737 --> 10:39.306
I mean, I suppose --
I'm in.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.341
Don't put it in the oven!
Put it in a drawer.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.642
Look at that!

10:42.676 --> 10:44.311
A school so successful,

10:44.344 --> 10:46.113
it triples in attendance
in a day.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.447
Hey.
How was your day?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.615
Not bad.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.317
I decided
to homeschool JJ,

10:50.350 --> 10:52.019
then Ray and Dylan expressed
an interest --

10:52.052 --> 10:53.453
which I didn't
fully explore --

10:53.486 --> 10:54.822
so I'm gonna pull them
out of school

10:54.855 --> 10:56.223
and educate them
all myself!

10:57.657 --> 10:59.693
Great. How did their dad
take that?

10:59.727 --> 11:01.528
Oh, right.
Yeah, I didn't ask him.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.330
Mm.
Tell you what --
we need another teacher.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.367
Okay. Well,
I'll call in sick to work.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.336
At least, call in
"very concerned" to work.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.639
Hey, DiMeos,
I'm successful, right?

11:12.672 --> 11:13.673
Compared to what?

11:13.707 --> 11:16.043
Turns out
my ex is a gold digger,

11:16.076 --> 11:18.211
and she doesn't want
to dig me.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.379
Well, obviously,
it's a good thing

11:19.412 --> 11:20.881
this woman is no longer
in your life.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.750
Uh-huh. Do you guys have
anything I can borrow

11:22.783 --> 11:24.317
to show her I'm fancy?

11:24.351 --> 11:26.153
What's the most expensive thing
you have?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.420
JJ's wheelchair?

11:29.256 --> 11:30.924
What's the next
most expensive thing?

11:32.225 --> 11:33.026
This plate.

11:33.060 --> 11:38.999
**

11:39.032 --> 11:41.401
All right,
time for class, I guess.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.737
We have two new students today
at DiMeo Academy.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.272
Dylan and Ray, welcome.

11:46.974 --> 11:49.042
Hey, I think I recognize you
from my old school.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.045
You're that kid
who farted.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.514
I'm your teacher --
Mr. DiMeo.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.916
Where's Mom and JJ?

11:55.949 --> 11:58.018
Oh, they are on
what your mother called

11:58.051 --> 12:01.121
"an exploration
of the tapestry of life,"

12:01.154 --> 12:03.290
which...
the zoo, maybe?

12:03.323 --> 12:05.258
Here are some math books.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.060
Wait.
We're doing schoolwork?

12:07.094 --> 12:08.395
DiMeo Academy is
for real?

12:08.428 --> 12:10.798
I thought this was just
one of Mom's crazy ideas

12:10.831 --> 12:13.366
that would blow over
once she stopped being
mad at the school.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.802
Oh, good.
That's what I thought, too.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.870
Can I just watch you guys
play video games or whatever?

12:16.904 --> 12:21.241
**

12:21.274 --> 12:22.609
It's what I'd be
doing anyways.

12:22.642 --> 12:25.578
I am a success.

12:25.612 --> 12:28.381
I own this car.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.217
I own many cars.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.751
This isn't even
my favorite car.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.053
I hate this car.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.121
Nice car!

12:34.154 --> 12:35.455
I hate it.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.228
Just a little low.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.264
You never get
used to that. Hm.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.799
This is yours?

12:45.833 --> 12:47.634
Why were you driving
that junker yesterday?

12:47.667 --> 12:48.969
Oh, that old thing?

12:49.002 --> 12:51.338
I drive that sometimes
just to keep me humble.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.605
It doesn't work.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.309
So, what is it
you're doing?

12:56.343 --> 12:58.511
Oh, you know --
real estate, music.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.180
Pretty much exactly
what I told you

13:00.213 --> 13:02.115
I was gonna do
back in the day.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.351
I guess I had it wrong
yesterday.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.786
Mm-hmm. Well, I'm glad
we cleared that up, right?

13:08.221 --> 13:09.823
But, uh,
a bit of a tip --

13:09.857 --> 13:13.460
Robin, don't be so obsessed
with success and money.

13:13.493 --> 13:16.096
It --
It's not a good look.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.167
What -- This thing
jumped in my car to pee?!

13:20.200 --> 13:21.768
No, dog! No!

13:21.801 --> 13:23.103
Relax, Kenneth.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.337
Stop, man!

13:24.371 --> 13:26.206
It's your fault!

13:26.239 --> 13:28.441
Why do you got to give it
such delicious water?

13:28.475 --> 13:31.211
Good afternoon, students.
Another stellar field trip.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.513
JJ, would you like
a break?

13:33.546 --> 13:35.182
Too bad. Pop quiz.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.549
Ah -- physics,
starting in...

13:36.583 --> 13:37.617
three minutes ago?!

13:37.650 --> 13:39.686
What?!

13:39.719 --> 13:41.454
Go on.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.123
Ah, hello,
Mr. DiMeo.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.824
Is that an experiment?

13:44.858 --> 13:48.528
Yes. I am testing the effects
of ice cream sodas on smiles.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.832
Oh, yes, there appears
to be a correlation.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.567
This isn't the kind of thing
you've been doing all day...?

13:54.601 --> 13:55.568
What did you study?

13:55.602 --> 13:57.070
History.
Science.
Plus.

13:57.104 --> 14:00.040
More of a..."answer
one at a time" situation.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.409
A word in my office,
Mr. DiMeo?

14:02.442 --> 14:04.544
Your lie was "Plus"?

14:04.577 --> 14:07.247
**

14:07.280 --> 14:08.481
I don't think
you're taking this seriously.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.483
How serious
am I supposed to take it?

14:10.517 --> 14:11.751
I'm standing
in a principal's office

14:11.784 --> 14:13.186
that is covered
in underwear.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.721
This is just temporary.

14:14.754 --> 14:17.357
Next month, I was thinking
we could renovate the garage

14:17.390 --> 14:18.892
and maybe get
a woodworking course out of it.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.260
We're still gonna be
doing this next month?

14:20.293 --> 14:21.561
We're doing this
till JJ graduates.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.897
I thought you were
just blowing off steam.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.432
No. We're done.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.067
Are you not on board
with the DiMeo Academy?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.868
Your name's in the title.
I threw you a bone.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.004
I was this close
to calling it "Maya Academy."

14:31.038 --> 14:33.573
This isn't a school!
It's a tantrum!

14:33.606 --> 14:37.510
Someone told you "No,"
so you went to war, like always.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.379
You don't ask if the war
is worth fighting,

14:39.412 --> 14:41.281
and you certainly don't ask
what I think.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.050
JJ had a problem.
I fixed it.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.451
That's what I do, Jimmy.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.853
And all this underwear --
it's yours!

14:46.886 --> 14:50.590
I always have your back,
but this is a bad idea, Maya.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.260
You can't teach him stuff
that you just learned yesterday.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.062
Ecoutez-moi bien,
mon petit mec.

14:55.095 --> 14:58.031
Tais-toi, sinon je vais
tu faire désolé --

14:58.065 --> 15:00.467
désolé vraiment!

15:00.500 --> 15:02.569
I will give you that your French
has gotten very good.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.741
I blot and blot,
and it just keeps coming.

15:08.775 --> 15:09.642
I need more towels.

15:09.676 --> 15:10.978
You've already
used eight.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.646
Then I guess
I need nine, Robin.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.748
This old thing's due
for a detailing anyway.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.550
This old thing
is a rental!

15:17.584 --> 15:18.385
What?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.220
It's not my car.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.488
These aren't my clothes.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.656
The watch is mine,
but it's stupid.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.958
"V-I-I."

15:24.992 --> 15:26.393
Just say "seven"!

15:26.426 --> 15:29.429
I just wanted you to...
think I was a success.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.098
I knew it!

15:31.131 --> 15:33.900
The second you saw
my fish tank, I thought,

15:33.933 --> 15:35.835
"He's looking at them
like a poor guy."

15:35.868 --> 15:37.004
You're onto me.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.271
I've got nothing.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.107
I'm no big shot.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.674
I'm just an aide
to a kid.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.977
Like...
you help someone?

15:44.011 --> 15:45.445
Yeah. Why?

15:45.478 --> 15:46.946
Does that impress you?

15:46.980 --> 15:48.281
Not at all.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.483
It's just a little
out of character.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.986
I mean, our whole thing was
about having fun,

15:53.020 --> 15:54.821
not caring about
other people.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.156
Remember that one time

15:56.189 --> 15:58.191
that guy had that heart attack
at the nightclub

15:58.225 --> 15:59.859
and we just kept dancing?

15:59.892 --> 16:02.695
I Electric-Slid
right past him.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.297
That was our thing.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.966
**

16:07.000 --> 16:08.301
Well, I guess
I've changed.

16:09.536 --> 16:10.703
I don't have nothing.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.506
I think...

16:16.309 --> 16:17.344
...I'm fulfilled.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.946
Congratulations...?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.681
Robin, it's been
a pleasure,

16:21.714 --> 16:23.783
but I got to tell
a car-rental company

16:23.816 --> 16:26.119
that it smelled like this
when I got it.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.188
If you ever become
a fulfillment digger,

16:28.221 --> 16:29.922
you know who to call.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.325
Hmm.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.793
**

16:33.826 --> 16:34.794
Eugggh.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.463
**

16:36.496 --> 16:37.830
Oh, right.
Your car's here.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.032
I've signed you up

16:39.066 --> 16:41.301
to hear a guest lecture
at the university

16:41.334 --> 16:43.170
'cause I'm
a humble-enough teacher

16:43.203 --> 16:46.806
to know I don't know everything
about the Second Balkan War.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.308
And you're going to see
for yourself

16:48.341 --> 16:50.510
just how ready for college
you are.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.545
Go forth
into the world.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.614
Let nothing stand
in your way.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.718
Oh, door.
Yeah. Sorry.

16:58.751 --> 16:59.719
There we are.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.221
Fit right in
with those diploma kids,

17:01.254 --> 17:02.689
smarty-pants.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.925
How did you sleep?

17:05.958 --> 17:08.528
We might need a new sofa
in the faculty lounge.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.397
JJ did well on his test.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.065
I mean, very well.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.666
Good.
You must be happy.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.769
I know. You'd think.
I should be.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.938
I don't like it
when we disagree.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.840
It's new,
and I hate it.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.443
Not new. I just don't tell you
all the time.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.544
What don't you tell me?

17:24.577 --> 17:26.045
I don't like Indian food.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.347
What,
not even the samosas?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.182
Oh, wait. No,
I do love the samosas.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.583
You're right again.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.885
I know.
I'm right a lot.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.955
But I don't want you to feel
steamrolled by my decisions.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.857
How about we give
DiMeo Academy a chance,

17:37.890 --> 17:40.793
and in a month, if it's not
working, we'll revisit?

17:40.827 --> 17:43.029
Three months, and we turn the
garage into a faculty lounge.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.432
Two months, and I agree
to call you "Principal DiMeo."

17:47.134 --> 17:48.601
Oh. Look at me --
compromising.

17:48.635 --> 17:49.536
Yeah.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.372
**

17:54.474 --> 18:01.047
**

18:01.080 --> 18:03.750
Hey, man. You trying
to get somewhere or...?

18:05.118 --> 18:06.119
"Yes.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.020
I'm trying
to get here."

18:09.256 --> 18:11.124
Whoa.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.592
Okay.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.596
[ Announcer speaking
indistinctly ]
So, it's settled.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.631
DiMeo Academy will
continue for JJ,

18:18.665 --> 18:21.301
and Dylan and Ray
will return to Lafayette

18:21.334 --> 18:23.270
after Dylan beats them
in the track meet.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.805
Yeah. And we'll explore
changing the nickname.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.507
[ Wheelchair beeping,
whirring ]

18:27.540 --> 18:28.908
Oh, hey! You made it!

18:28.941 --> 18:30.843
Did you learn
anything today?

18:30.877 --> 18:34.681
"I learned I want to quit
DiMeo Academy."

18:34.714 --> 18:37.184
What?
I mean, it's working.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.186
We're proving
that we can do it.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.688
"No, you're proving

18:41.721 --> 18:46.259
you can and will
do anything for me.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.628
We already knew that.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.130
But that's not life.

18:51.164 --> 18:55.168
I checked out college
today.

18:55.202 --> 19:00.173
It's a bunch of people
taking care of themselves.

19:00.207 --> 19:03.676
I need practice doing that
before I go."

19:04.977 --> 19:06.313
Okay, well...

19:06.346 --> 19:08.047
I mean,
whatever you want.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.549
But if you go back here,

19:09.582 --> 19:11.484
you're gonna have to repeat
a whole extra year.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.685
You know that, right?

19:12.719 --> 19:14.387
And all your friends
will have graduated.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.689
You're sure about this, JJ?
It's -- It's all you.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.193
See that?

19:20.227 --> 19:21.861
Independent thinking.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.663
He got that
from DiMeo Academy.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.865
You picked up a lot there
in a week.

19:25.898 --> 19:31.137
"I've been going
to DiMeo Academy all my life."

19:31.170 --> 19:33.406
**

19:33.440 --> 19:35.041
Mm.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.576
We did good
with that one.

19:36.609 --> 19:39.979
* This is the fight
of your life! *

19:40.012 --> 19:41.848
Others may have
suffered.

19:41.881 --> 19:45.852
Announcer:
Running for DiMeo Academy --
Dylan "Salt" DiMeo.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.153
Why is your nickname
"Salt"?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.188
Because salt kills slugs.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.358
Normal slugs,
but we're sea slugs.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.392
We live in salt water.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.662
I saw your wife's car
outside of the Red Roof Inn

19:55.695 --> 19:57.029
last Friday night.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.598
You have a good race, now.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.234
All right, let's get up.
Get ready, ladies. Come on, now.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.703
Runners, take your marks.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.538
On your mark, get set...

20:06.873 --> 20:08.441
[ Applause,
indistinct shouting ]

20:08.475 --> 20:10.743
Yeah!
How's my butt taste?

20:10.777 --> 20:12.379
Where you at, Captain?

20:12.412 --> 20:13.746
Yeah, Dylan!

20:13.780 --> 20:15.882
Ohh! Ohh!

20:17.484 --> 20:18.585
Stupid leg!

20:18.618 --> 20:20.953
After all the cool things
I let you kick!

20:20.987 --> 20:22.689
Come on.
I'll help you.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.357
No! Please -- get away!

20:24.391 --> 20:26.393
We're not finishing this race
without you.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.428
Once a sea slug,
always a sea slug.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.463
I-I don't want
your stupid sportsmanship!

20:30.497 --> 20:32.599
No! Please don't
record this!

20:32.632 --> 20:33.866
I don't want
to go viral!

20:33.900 --> 20:35.935
Internet, my name is
Renee Jenkins!

20:35.968 --> 20:37.570
This is Ireland!

20:38.971 --> 20:40.307
Thanks, girls.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.809
You're better people
than I am.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.444
Please push me
across the line first.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.250
I thought

20:51.284 --> 20:52.719
what your teammates did for you
was really beautiful.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.720
I'm gonna share it with
all my social-media followers.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.954
Mom already saw it, Ray.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.989
Aw! Did I miss
the meet?

20:57.023 --> 20:59.258
I wanted to see you stick it
to the old school.

20:59.292 --> 21:02.295
It is the new school.
DiMeo Academy is no more.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.730
Yeah, it's probably
just as well,

21:03.763 --> 21:05.832
'cause I've really missed
yelling at principals.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.434
I'm coming for you,
Miller!!

21:07.467 --> 21:09.268
Mm. That's the stuff,
innit?

21:09.302 --> 21:10.403
Okay.

21:10.437 --> 21:14.073
Well, JJ, looks like
we're back in the saddle.

21:14.106 --> 21:18.911
Maybe your new school would like
to see you ride off in style.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.748
"Since when
are you rich?"

21:21.781 --> 21:23.015
Since I met you,
buddy.

21:24.317 --> 21:25.752
So, where would you
like to go?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.820
Back to the rental place
it is.
