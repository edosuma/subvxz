00:02.123 --> 00:03.134
<i>This season...</i>

00:04.526 --> 00:07.493
They're so tiny.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.863
<i>The best aspiring
young chefs in America...</i>

00:09.898 --> 00:12.532
gigantic mixer coming through.

00:12.567 --> 00:13.666
Why am I so short?

00:13.702 --> 00:14.712
<i>Have already faced...</i>

00:14.736 --> 00:15.702
Oh, my God!

00:15.737 --> 00:17.036
<i>The biggest...</i>

00:17.072 --> 00:18.671
What the heck happened
to you, Gordon?

00:18.707 --> 00:19.806
<i>Most explosive...</i>

00:19.841 --> 00:21.708
Marshmallows!

00:21.743 --> 00:23.977
<i>And
out-of-this-world challenges.</i>

00:24.012 --> 00:26.179
Oh, my God!

00:26.214 --> 00:29.249
This is the hardest
challenge ever.

00:29.284 --> 00:31.784
Congratulations, blue team!

00:33.021 --> 00:34.387
<i>And now...</i>

00:34.422 --> 00:36.234
are you old
enough to be doing this?

00:36.258 --> 00:39.058
<i>Only the ten most
talented junior home cooks remain.</i>

00:39.094 --> 00:40.593
you're top of the class.

00:40.629 --> 00:41.995
Great job.

00:42.030 --> 00:44.564
This is one bodacious
surf-and-turf.

00:44.599 --> 00:45.765
At 8 years of age,

00:45.800 --> 00:47.233
you are a freak.

00:50.572 --> 00:51.671
<i>Tonight...</i>

00:53.875 --> 00:55.808
<i>On a two-hour masterchef,</i>

00:55.844 --> 00:58.411
<i>it's an "egg-splosive"
team challenge...</i>

00:58.446 --> 00:59.746
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Go!

00:59.781 --> 01:00.781
<i>With a twist.</i>

01:00.815 --> 01:03.583
there is another team:

01:03.618 --> 01:05.385
Graham Elliot and Gordon ramsay.

01:05.420 --> 01:08.855
How the heck are the kids
gonna win this?

01:08.890 --> 01:09.856
<i>And then...</i>

01:09.891 --> 01:11.190
Switch!

01:11.226 --> 01:12.470
<i>A masterchef junior classic...</i>

01:12.494 --> 01:13.838
it's the hardest
tag-team challenge

01:13.862 --> 01:16.396
that we've ever asked
any home cook to undertake.

01:16.431 --> 01:17.441
<i>Pairs the top eight...</i>

01:17.465 --> 01:19.065
Whoa.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.912
<i>In the most intense
challenge of the season.</i>

01:20.936 --> 01:21.901
Stop crying, Amaya.

01:21.937 --> 01:23.503
I'm trying, I'm trying!

01:23.538 --> 01:25.605
The lamb is not cooked!

01:25.640 --> 01:27.273
This is not good.

01:27.309 --> 01:28.641
Faster!

01:28.677 --> 01:31.044
People are going home today!

01:43.425 --> 01:45.992
<i>Right now this
competition is anyone's game,</i>

01:46.027 --> 01:48.328
because we're all
the very, very best.

01:48.363 --> 01:49.529
Oh, my gosh.

01:49.564 --> 01:50.797
<i>This is the top ten.</i>

01:50.832 --> 01:53.700
<i>You've got to get
everything right.</i>

01:53.735 --> 01:54.901
Good morning.

01:54.936 --> 01:56.569
- Where's Graham?
- Where's Graham?

01:56.604 --> 01:57.904
Graham?

02:00.976 --> 02:02.775
- Oh, my God.
- What the heck?

02:02.811 --> 02:04.177
Oh, my gosh.

02:05.246 --> 02:06.479
God, that's crazy.

02:06.514 --> 02:07.480
Bawk-bawk, baby.

02:07.515 --> 02:09.215
It's chicken time.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.316
Oh, my gosh!

02:17.926 --> 02:20.259
I'm not sure if you should
be proud of this.

02:20.295 --> 02:23.029
<i>Graham's moves are really cool,</i>

02:23.064 --> 02:25.365
but a little bit weird.

02:27.936 --> 02:29.936
Graham, what are you doing?

02:32.374 --> 02:35.508
Anyway, I'm sure you can
all guess now

02:35.543 --> 02:39.078
what the next challenge
is all about.

02:39.114 --> 02:41.314
Eggs!

02:41.349 --> 02:42.482
That's right.

02:42.517 --> 02:44.517
Now, there are ten of you
in front of us,

02:44.552 --> 02:48.287
but only four of you will
compete in this next challenge,

02:48.323 --> 02:50.189
in two teams of two.

02:50.225 --> 02:51.324
Oh.

02:51.359 --> 02:52.892
One by one,
you will come up here,

02:52.927 --> 02:55.728
take an egg, and...

03:01.636 --> 03:03.736
crack it on Graham's head.

03:05.106 --> 03:08.574
If inside that egg
is red or blue,

03:08.610 --> 03:09.809
then you are in the game.

03:09.844 --> 03:12.178
I want to be in the game.

03:12.213 --> 03:14.280
First egg goes to Addison.

03:14.315 --> 03:16.549
- Come on up, girl.
- Come on, addy.

03:16.584 --> 03:18.818
<i>It's a huge disadvantage for me</i>

03:18.853 --> 03:20.119
<i>to be the first one picking,</i>

03:20.155 --> 03:21.954
<i>because it's
a very little chance</i>

03:21.990 --> 03:24.190
<i>that I'm gonna pick
a red or blue egg.</i>

03:24.225 --> 03:25.625
But please, red or blue.

03:32.167 --> 03:34.200
Dang it, a regular egg.

03:34.235 --> 03:36.402
So you are not competing.

03:36.438 --> 03:38.905
- Head up to the balcony.
- Okay.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.473
Next up, Amaya.

03:40.508 --> 03:41.707
Amaya!

03:41.743 --> 03:43.576
Crack it, crack it...

03:43.611 --> 03:46.546
<i>I don't want to crack a
very hard egg over Graham Elliot.</i>

03:46.581 --> 03:49.248
I mean, he's so nice.

03:51.986 --> 03:53.219
Congratulations.

03:53.254 --> 03:55.154
You are in the blue team.

03:55.190 --> 03:56.622
<i>This is awesome.</i>

03:56.658 --> 03:58.191
<i>I get to participate
in this challenge,</i>

03:58.226 --> 03:59.992
<i>which I'm really excited about.</i>

04:00.028 --> 04:01.794
Zac, come on up.

04:01.830 --> 04:05.431
Crack it, crack it, crack it!

04:07.969 --> 04:09.769
Yes, I got a red egg.

04:09.804 --> 04:11.070
Congratulations.

04:11.106 --> 04:12.905
<i>Boom, baby, oh, yeah.</i>

04:12.941 --> 04:15.575
next up, Corey.

04:16.744 --> 04:17.709
I got a normal egg.

04:17.745 --> 04:19.045
That's gonna leave a Mark.

04:19.079 --> 04:20.846
Kamilly.

04:20.882 --> 04:23.516
<i>There's only one red
egg and one blue egg left.</i>

04:23.551 --> 04:25.251
And I want the red egg,

04:25.286 --> 04:27.854
<i>because Zac is
such a strong leader,</i>

04:27.889 --> 04:29.522
and he knows how
<i>to control the team.</i>

04:29.557 --> 04:31.390
crack it, crack it!

04:35.230 --> 04:36.696
I love this game.

04:36.731 --> 04:37.697
Congratulations.

04:37.732 --> 04:38.698
You're on the red team.

04:38.733 --> 04:40.199
- Look at that.
- Three eggs left.

04:40.235 --> 04:42.075
Graham, come here,
I need to tell you a secret.

04:43.838 --> 04:44.937
It's a normal egg.

04:44.973 --> 04:47.373
Head up to the balcony.

04:47.408 --> 04:49.909
There are two contestants left,

04:49.944 --> 04:52.211
two eggs in the basket,

04:52.247 --> 04:54.947
and one space left.

04:54.983 --> 04:56.093
Ladies first, right, come here.

04:56.117 --> 04:57.283
- Ladies first.
- Yay!

04:57.318 --> 04:59.352
Kya!

04:59.387 --> 05:00.720
You got to be a gentleman.

05:00.755 --> 05:03.990
One, two, three.

05:07.028 --> 05:09.228
Oh, kya!

05:09.264 --> 05:10.508
You are in the blue team.

05:10.532 --> 05:11.497
Yes!

05:11.533 --> 05:13.866
Jj, that means the last egg

05:13.902 --> 05:15.234
is a normal egg.

05:15.270 --> 05:18.204
So, you are safe
on this challenge.

05:18.239 --> 05:19.505
Head up to the balcony.

05:19.541 --> 05:21.385
Red team, blue team,
please come down to the front.

05:21.409 --> 05:22.542
Thank you.

05:22.577 --> 05:24.343
<i>Kamilly is an amazing chef,</i>

05:24.379 --> 05:27.146
<i>so I'm super excited to do
a team challenge with her.</i>

05:27.182 --> 05:30.416
But what do the judges
have in store for us?

05:33.388 --> 05:37.023
Now, this challenge
is all about perfection

05:37.058 --> 05:38.391
in one bite.

05:41.629 --> 05:43.196
Deviled eggs.

05:43.231 --> 05:44.497
Oh.

05:44.532 --> 05:46.899
Creamy seasoned yolks

05:46.935 --> 05:50.403
piped into those hardboiled
egg white halves.

05:50.438 --> 05:54.674
And a delicate sprinkling
of paprika and chives.

05:54.709 --> 05:55.875
Yes.

05:55.910 --> 05:57.376
You two teams

05:57.412 --> 06:02.181
will have to make as many
perfect deviled eggs as you can.

06:02.217 --> 06:04.116
<i>Oh, man.</i>

06:04.152 --> 06:06.419
I have not made a deviled egg,

06:06.454 --> 06:09.388
<i>so I'm just hoping that Zac
knows how to cook them,</i>

06:09.424 --> 06:12.124
<i>or else we're doomed.</i>

06:12.160 --> 06:14.026
Delicious.

06:14.062 --> 06:16.229
You guys may also have noticed

06:16.264 --> 06:19.031
there are three stations
set up behind you.

06:19.067 --> 06:20.700
Oh, gosh.

06:20.735 --> 06:23.436
There is another team
competing against you tonight.

06:23.471 --> 06:25.938
- What?
- what?

06:25.974 --> 06:29.976
Let me introduce you
to the yellow team:

06:30.011 --> 06:33.246
Graham Elliot and Gordon ramsay.

06:33.281 --> 06:34.480
Why?

06:34.515 --> 06:37.216
<i>Gordon ramsay and Graham Elliot</i>

06:37.252 --> 06:40.720
against a 12-year-old
and a couple other kids...

06:40.755 --> 06:43.789
I mean, this is pretty unfair.

06:43.825 --> 06:44.945
You look like a little girl.

06:46.060 --> 06:48.127
I cannot wait

06:48.162 --> 06:50.162
to kick your butts.

06:50.198 --> 06:52.064
I cannot wait to kick <i> your</i> butt.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.499
Kick your butt.

06:53.534 --> 06:56.135
You two teams
will have 12 minutes.

06:56.170 --> 06:57.637
But, to try and make it fair,

06:57.672 --> 07:00.773
the yellow team will
only get half the time.

07:00.808 --> 07:02.041
- What?
- oh, come on.

07:02.076 --> 07:03.876
That's not fair.

07:03.911 --> 07:06.946
The winning team will not
have to cook in this next challenge.

07:06.981 --> 07:08.814
But if they win,

07:08.850 --> 07:11.751
both teams will have
to face the next challenge.

07:11.786 --> 07:13.519
No, why do you guys
do this to us?

07:13.554 --> 07:16.155
It's time to head
to your station.

07:16.190 --> 07:18.090
Come on, kamilly, we got this.

07:18.126 --> 07:19.336
At your station,
you're gonna find a bowl

07:19.360 --> 07:21.560
of 24 hardboiled eggs,

07:21.596 --> 07:24.297
mustard, mayonnaise, vinegar,
salt, pepper, chives,

07:24.332 --> 07:26.132
and four deviled egg trays

07:26.167 --> 07:29.769
that are gonna perfectly fit
48 delicious deviled eggs.

07:29.804 --> 07:31.971
Are you guys ready
to get cracking?

07:32.006 --> 07:33.639
Yes, chef!

07:33.675 --> 07:34.840
Yes, chef.

07:34.876 --> 07:38.411
Your 12 minutes start...

07:38.446 --> 07:41.347
Now.

07:41.382 --> 07:44.283
Peel them eggs, peel them eggs!

07:44.319 --> 07:45.818
Peel them eggs!

07:45.853 --> 07:47.631
All right, Graham,
we need to hatch a plan.

07:47.655 --> 07:49.366
Now, the fastest way
to peel a hardboiled egg

07:49.390 --> 07:50.390
is in a bowl of water.

07:50.425 --> 07:51.390
Absolutely.

07:51.426 --> 07:52.536
Because it releases the membrane

07:52.560 --> 07:54.160
and should remove that shell.

07:54.195 --> 07:59.031
Don't roll them too hard,
'cause mine broke a bit.

07:59.067 --> 08:00.067
Perfect.

08:00.101 --> 08:01.312
And then cut them in half,

08:01.336 --> 08:02.368
get the yolks out,

08:02.403 --> 08:03.936
put your whites into the trays,

08:03.971 --> 08:05.237
and as one person's mashing,

08:05.273 --> 08:07.006
then you continue
shelling the eggs.

08:07.041 --> 08:11.143
Our game plan is to crack open
the eggs as fast as we can,

08:11.179 --> 08:12.812
<i>because we only
have five minutes</i>

08:12.847 --> 08:15.414
<i>before Graham and Gordon
are coming in.</i>

08:15.450 --> 08:16.849
Come on, guys, you can do it.

08:16.884 --> 08:18.028
I can't do this;
This is hard.

08:18.052 --> 08:19.018
Yes, you can.

08:19.053 --> 08:20.086
You got this, all right?

08:20.121 --> 08:21.454
<i>Communication is key,</i>

08:21.489 --> 08:24.557
because kamilly has never
made a deviled egg,

08:24.592 --> 08:26.225
<i>so I have to step up
to the plate.</i>

08:26.260 --> 08:27.771
Just roll it around
in a circle like that,

08:27.795 --> 08:29.495
and then most of it comes off.

08:29.530 --> 08:33.164
<i>So, that way, we can win
this challenge as a team.</i>

08:36.104 --> 08:37.847
So, Christina, what is
the perfect deviled egg?

08:37.871 --> 08:39.917
There should be no
egg shell left on the egg white.

08:39.941 --> 08:42.741
There should be no indentation
from clumsy peeling.

08:42.777 --> 08:44.410
Scoop those yolks out, hurry!

08:44.445 --> 08:46.078
Okay.

08:46.114 --> 08:47.691
That filling, though,
it has to be smooth and even.

08:47.715 --> 08:50.182
Otherwise it's never gonna
come out of that piping bag.

08:50.218 --> 08:51.484
That is a very important part.

08:51.519 --> 08:53.552
Christina, you're
giving them pointers.

08:53.588 --> 08:54.553
I'm giving you pointers.

08:54.589 --> 08:55.589
You can hear me too.

08:55.623 --> 08:57.056
In that water, girl, keep going.

08:57.091 --> 08:58.091
Push, push, guys.

08:58.126 --> 08:59.925
There's just one minute

08:59.961 --> 09:02.328
until the yellow team
gets in the game.

09:02.363 --> 09:03.462
What?

09:03.498 --> 09:05.097
Kya, we better start moving.

09:05.133 --> 09:08.467
Let's go fast.

09:08.503 --> 09:10.336
Zac, you can do it!

09:12.840 --> 09:14.807
<i>Gordon and Graham
are just about to start,</i>

09:14.842 --> 09:16.942
and they're just gonna destroy.

09:16.978 --> 09:21.380
Yellow team in five, four,
three, two, one.

09:21.416 --> 09:22.948
Hit it!

09:22.984 --> 09:24.483
Go, go, go!

09:24.519 --> 09:27.052
No, I haven't started!

09:27.088 --> 09:29.088
- All right.
- Let's go.

09:30.324 --> 09:31.991
Two at a time, Graham!

09:32.026 --> 09:33.026
Two at a time!

09:33.060 --> 09:34.727
Come on, quick, quick, quick.

09:34.762 --> 09:35.973
This is, like, impossible here.

09:35.997 --> 09:37.296
<i>Red team and blue team</i>

09:37.331 --> 09:40.666
<i>are competing against
two of the best chefs</i>

09:40.701 --> 09:42.101
in the world.

09:42.136 --> 09:44.270
Wow, they're going pretty fast.

09:44.305 --> 09:45.816
Come on, kamilly,
come on, come on, come on.

09:45.840 --> 09:49.074
How the heck are the kids
gonna win this?

09:49.110 --> 09:50.609
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

09:50.645 --> 09:52.044
Come on, come on, come on.

09:55.812 --> 09:56.945
Go!

09:56.980 --> 09:58.647
Come on, Gordon, you can do it.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.482
<i>We only have a few minutes left</i>

10:00.517 --> 10:02.851
to make as many deviled eggs
as we can.

10:02.886 --> 10:04.152
Two at a time!

10:04.187 --> 10:05.987
Oh, my God, they're almost
done already.

10:06.023 --> 10:09.658
<i>And Gordon and Graham are
going through this super quick.</i>

10:09.693 --> 10:12.527
<i>I'm like, oh, my God, we have
to speed up right now,</i>

10:12.563 --> 10:15.397
otherwise I don't know how
we're gonna win this challenge.

10:15.432 --> 10:16.932
Add the mustard!

10:16.967 --> 10:18.011
Keep going, guys.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.401
The yellow team's catching up.

10:19.436 --> 10:22.671
Do not let these
world-famous chefs beat you.

10:22.706 --> 10:23.838
Never!

10:23.874 --> 10:25.006
Let's do this, kya!

10:25.042 --> 10:26.107
Ah, here you go.

10:26.143 --> 10:27.108
Got it, got it, got it.

10:27.144 --> 10:28.643
Go, go, go, go, go.

10:28.679 --> 10:30.412
Amaya, get those yolks
broken up.

10:30.447 --> 10:32.647
Mix, mix, mix!

10:32.683 --> 10:33.648
What do they taste like?

10:33.684 --> 10:34.649
A little rich.

10:34.685 --> 10:36.685
I need a little more yolk.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.088
Just over three minutes to go.

10:40.123 --> 10:42.657
You need to get piping.

10:42.693 --> 10:44.025
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.026
Fill up the bag.

10:45.062 --> 10:47.062
Come on, Amaya.

10:47.097 --> 10:48.863
Amaya's piping.

10:48.899 --> 10:53.034
I'm squeezing as hard as I can,
and it won't come out.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.736
Kya, this isn't piping.

10:54.771 --> 10:55.937
We got a problem.

10:55.973 --> 10:57.205
<i>It's a nightmare.</i>

10:57.240 --> 10:58.240
Oh, no.

10:58.275 --> 10:59.874
Yeah, that's a bad decision.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.677
<i>The key to making
a perfect deviled egg</i>

11:02.713 --> 11:06.281
is not putting too much filling,

11:06.316 --> 11:07.816
<i>but then not putting too little.</i>

11:07.851 --> 11:09.618
Come on, kamilly,
let's go, let's go.

11:09.653 --> 11:12.253
<i>It needs to be
just the right amount.</i>

11:12.289 --> 11:16.858
Even the best chefs in the world
can make a complete mess.

11:16.893 --> 11:17.971
Get them in, get them in.

11:17.995 --> 11:18.960
Oh!

11:18.996 --> 11:20.028
Dude.

11:20.063 --> 11:21.029
They're having trouble!

11:21.064 --> 11:22.430
They're having trouble!

11:22.466 --> 11:24.966
What are they doing?

11:25.002 --> 11:30.071
Zac, that is
some sick knife skill.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.773
One minute left!

11:31.808 --> 11:33.108
- Go, go, go, go.
- Let's go.

11:33.143 --> 11:34.743
60 seconds... fill up my bag!

11:34.778 --> 11:36.444
You got to chop the chives!

11:36.480 --> 11:39.047
I don't care!
Fill up my bag!

11:39.082 --> 11:40.949
Guys, communicate.

11:40.984 --> 11:43.518
Gordon ramsay, hurry!

11:43.553 --> 11:45.086
Come on, sprinkle.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.888
Finishing touches, guys.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.323
Make those eggs nice.

11:48.358 --> 11:49.369
Yeah, get it, get it, get it.

11:49.393 --> 11:50.625
15 seconds!

11:50.661 --> 11:51.661
Do it, guys!

11:51.695 --> 11:54.062
Yellow team, yellow team!

11:54.097 --> 11:55.363
Push, red team.

11:55.399 --> 11:56.431
Just sprinkle it!

11:56.466 --> 12:00.802
Five, four, three, two...

12:00.837 --> 12:02.103
one!

12:02.139 --> 12:03.805
Hands up, guys.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.306
Oh, my God.

12:05.342 --> 12:06.374
Wow.

12:07.878 --> 12:09.678
Now I will come around

12:09.713 --> 12:13.782
and determine how many
of your eggs are acceptable.

12:13.817 --> 12:17.085
The winning team will be
going nowhere tonight.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.320
But if Gordon and Graham win,

12:19.356 --> 12:22.991
then everybody will face
the next challenge.

12:23.026 --> 12:26.227
I think our deviled eggs
are perfect,

12:26.263 --> 12:30.732
<i>and maybe, just maybe,
we can win this advantage.</i>

12:30.767 --> 12:32.100
Aah!

12:32.135 --> 12:34.035
<i>All of ours are not perfect,</i>

12:34.071 --> 12:36.838
but I think we got more eggs
on the plate.

12:36.873 --> 12:40.041
<i>But the yellow team, I mean,
they're world-class chefs.</i>

12:40.077 --> 12:42.510
I've never lost anything
in my life, Graham.

12:42.546 --> 12:47.515
All of my friends back home are
gonna be a teeny bit jealous

12:47.551 --> 12:50.852
<i>if I beat</i> the <i> Gordon ramsay.</i>

12:50.887 --> 12:53.555
I mean, if we didn't win it,
we're a close second, for sure.

12:53.590 --> 12:55.868
All three teams,
please come down to the front.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.064
So, results are in.

13:03.100 --> 13:06.901
One team got three,
one team got six,

13:06.937 --> 13:09.671
and the winning team got ten.

13:09.706 --> 13:13.108
Yellow team, you scored three.

13:13.143 --> 13:14.375
Oh, come on.

13:15.412 --> 13:17.812
- What?
- are you crazy?

13:17.848 --> 13:18.913
And the winning team,

13:18.949 --> 13:22.550
with ten perfect deviled eggs,

13:22.586 --> 13:23.586
is...

13:26.123 --> 13:27.288
The red team.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.993
<i>Boom, baby.</i>

13:32.028 --> 13:33.228
Final eight.

13:33.263 --> 13:34.896
Nice job.

13:34.931 --> 13:36.542
<i>I just beat two of the
best chefs in the world</i>

13:36.566 --> 13:37.866
<i>in a cooking competition.</i>

13:37.901 --> 13:39.834
<i>I mean, it's just mind-blowing.</i>

13:39.870 --> 13:41.536
You two, head up to the balcony,

13:41.571 --> 13:42.837
and everyone on the balcony,

13:42.873 --> 13:44.873
head on down to your station.

13:44.908 --> 13:48.409
It's now time for your next
elimination challenge.

13:51.715 --> 13:53.615
Right, this next
challenge tonight

13:53.650 --> 13:56.017
is all about dreams.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.119
Christina, Graham, and myself,

13:58.155 --> 14:01.189
honestly, are no different
to all of you here.

14:01.224 --> 14:02.991
When I was 8 years old,

14:03.026 --> 14:05.393
I dreamt of being

14:05.428 --> 14:08.396
Luke Skywalker's little brother
in the next "star wars" movie...

14:09.666 --> 14:14.369
And also one day having
my very own cookbook.

14:14.404 --> 14:17.071
Now, I'm still holding out
for the "star wars" call,

14:17.107 --> 14:20.141
but unlike my fellow judges,

14:20.177 --> 14:22.443
I've never had
a cookbook published.

14:22.479 --> 14:23.444
Mm.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.915
- Aww.
- aww.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.516
Until now.

14:30.987 --> 14:33.421
Finally.

14:33.456 --> 14:34.989
This is it, guys.

14:35.025 --> 14:38.660
My very first,
very awesome cookbook.

14:38.695 --> 14:40.829
I like it.

14:40.864 --> 14:42.675
Now, at the very
beginning of your journey

14:42.699 --> 14:44.165
here in the masterchef kitchen,

14:44.201 --> 14:45.767
we asked you to start thinking

14:45.802 --> 14:48.369
about your very own
cookbooks, as well.

14:48.405 --> 14:50.772
So hopefully
you've done your homework.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.174
Why don't you guys
take out your cookbooks?

14:53.210 --> 14:56.578
We're so curious to see
what you've been working on.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.953
Kya, we can't see your book.

15:04.988 --> 15:05.988
It's too small.

15:07.290 --> 15:08.723
It's half the size of me.

15:08.758 --> 15:10.191
It is about as big as you.

15:10.227 --> 15:11.593
What's the name
of that cookbook?

15:11.628 --> 15:14.229
It's called
"kya's culinary kaleidoscope."

15:14.264 --> 15:17.198
What kind of food is in
your cookbook, kya?

15:17.234 --> 15:19.367
French classics and my own food.

15:19.402 --> 15:21.135
- Looks great.
- Interesting.

15:21.171 --> 15:23.504
Avery, show us your book.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.306
What's it called?

15:25.342 --> 15:26.841
"Avery's amazing bayou food."

15:26.877 --> 15:31.112
It's bayou classics,
but also elevated.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.580
What's on the front cover?

15:32.616 --> 15:34.082
Me in my overalls,

15:34.117 --> 15:36.084
playing
"how you doin', darling?"

15:36.119 --> 15:37.085
I like that.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.286
Nice.

15:38.321 --> 15:40.121
Now, in this challenge,
we want each of you

15:40.156 --> 15:42.624
to make us your signature dish

15:42.659 --> 15:45.126
from your amazing
future cookbook,

15:45.161 --> 15:48.563
a dish that tells us your story.

15:48.598 --> 15:51.032
<i>I've been working
on my signature dish</i>

15:51.067 --> 15:52.433
since I was born,

15:52.469 --> 15:55.703
so I think I know
exactly what I'm doing.

15:55.739 --> 15:57.750
Sadly, at the end
of this challenge tonight,

15:57.774 --> 16:00.074
two of you will be leaving
the masterchef kitchen.

16:00.110 --> 16:02.443
Is everyone ready to cook us
your signature dish

16:02.479 --> 16:03.945
from your future cookbooks?

16:03.980 --> 16:06.147
Yes, chef!

16:06.182 --> 16:10.919
Your one hour starts...

16:10.954 --> 16:11.954
Now.

16:13.857 --> 16:15.490
Go, go, go, come on, guys.

16:15.525 --> 16:16.525
- Hurry.
- sorry.

16:17.961 --> 16:19.027
Out of my way!

16:19.062 --> 16:20.161
Out of <i> my</i> way.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.497
Oranges, oh, I need oranges!

16:22.532 --> 16:24.332
Garlic, lots of garlic.

16:24.367 --> 16:28.069
My cookbook is called
"Corey's slice of life."

16:28.104 --> 16:29.871
<i>It is full of island cuisine.</i>

16:29.906 --> 16:30.872
Rice!

16:30.907 --> 16:32.373
<i>My dad's from the Caribbean,</i>

16:32.409 --> 16:37.078
so I want to bring the culture
of St. Thomas to my dish.

16:37.113 --> 16:38.279
Ground nutmeg, okay.

16:38.315 --> 16:40.048
Has anybody seen the fennel?

16:40.083 --> 16:41.516
Eggs!

16:41.551 --> 16:46.087
This is "Addison's absolutely
divine delectables."

16:46.122 --> 16:47.989
<i>it has all my recipes.</i>

16:48.024 --> 16:49.791
I'm forgetting
the passion fruit.

16:49.826 --> 16:53.394
<i>The outside of my
bakery is a baseball diamond.</i>

16:53.430 --> 16:55.229
It'll look a little better
in real life.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.565
I'm not your best artist.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.033
Shortening, butter, salt.

16:59.069 --> 17:00.435
Mix it together.

17:00.470 --> 17:01.869
<i>I just love baking,</i>

17:01.905 --> 17:03.604
and I can't wait
to highlight that

17:03.640 --> 17:05.205
in this next challenge.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.674
Let's go, guys.

17:06.710 --> 17:08.009
Oh, my God, this is hard.

17:08.044 --> 17:10.712
Let's go, guys.

17:10.747 --> 17:13.414
Aw, jeez.

17:13.450 --> 17:14.915
Let's get a-cooking.

17:18.468 --> 17:20.532
Wow, congratulations on
"cooking like a master chef."

17:20.557 --> 17:22.357
- Thank you.
- And the book looks amazing.

17:22.392 --> 17:24.403
What are we looking for tonight
from these youngsters?

17:24.426 --> 17:27.095
I always think that it should be
us tasting a dish and saying,

17:27.130 --> 17:28.329
"I know this is Amaya's,"

17:28.365 --> 17:30.264
or "look how fun
and crazy this is.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.599
Has to be Addison's."

17:31.634 --> 17:33.401
It needs to be them on a plate.

17:33.436 --> 17:35.770
But I don't want
just one element on a plate

17:35.805 --> 17:37.305
that you've made in 60 minutes.

17:37.340 --> 17:38.439
No one can play it safe.

17:38.475 --> 17:39.475
No.

17:41.544 --> 17:42.788
How you doing, Avery, good?

17:42.812 --> 17:43.778
Great.

17:43.813 --> 17:44.846
Awesome.
keep it up.

17:44.881 --> 17:46.547
I've got to get
this roux cracking.

17:46.583 --> 17:48.082
All right, Avery.

17:48.118 --> 17:50.151
Louisiana, nine years old.

17:50.186 --> 17:52.587
Bayou-inspired cookbook.

17:52.622 --> 17:54.055
What is the dish
that you're doing?

17:54.090 --> 17:55.723
I'm doing a crawfish étouffée,

17:55.759 --> 17:57.392
served over steamed rice.

17:57.427 --> 17:58.393
Okay.

17:58.428 --> 17:59.394
I, like, grew up

17:59.429 --> 18:00.395
eating crawfish étouffée,

18:00.430 --> 18:02.096
like, for breakfast every day.

18:02.132 --> 18:04.699
We catch our own crawfish,
and we love to cook them.

18:04.734 --> 18:07.201
Now, can you show me your book?

18:07.237 --> 18:08.736
Right here.

18:08.772 --> 18:10.204
That looks great.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.206
Avery's Southern bistro.

18:12.242 --> 18:14.308
The theme of the restaurant
will be "sothern."

18:14.344 --> 18:16.844
That's s-o-t-h-e-r-n.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.913
So we're not serving any "u" s.

18:18.948 --> 18:22.817
I'm nine.
Give me a break.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.330
All right, good luck,
it sounds tasty.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.254
I hope that I can spell it
when it's done too.

18:26.289 --> 18:28.523
Ugh!

18:28.558 --> 18:30.958
Ten minutes gone,
50 minutes to go, guys.

18:30.994 --> 18:32.393
I want to see you on a plate,

18:32.429 --> 18:36.764
and you at your absolute best.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.199
Come on, Kaitlyn.

18:38.234 --> 18:39.500
- Right, Kaitlyn.
- Hi.

18:39.536 --> 18:40.501
What's the dish tonight?

18:40.537 --> 18:41.502
What's the signature dish?

18:41.538 --> 18:42.738
I'm making my version

18:42.772 --> 18:43.871
of black forest cupcakes.

18:43.907 --> 18:46.407
So dark chocolate and cherry?

18:46.443 --> 18:47.853
No, I'm not
doing cherry in this.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.445
Raspberries pair better
with dark chocolate.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.380
Black forest is cherry,
traditionally.

18:52.415 --> 18:54.248
So how many cupcakes
are you making?

18:54.284 --> 18:55.716
I'm probably only
gonna plate one.

18:55.752 --> 18:56.752
One cupcake.

18:56.786 --> 18:58.419
Oh, my God.

18:58.455 --> 18:59.887
Tell me about the frosting.

18:59.923 --> 19:02.657
It's just gonna be a simple
vanilla buttercream.

19:02.692 --> 19:04.136
Any alcohol, kirsch,
or liqueur in there?

19:04.160 --> 19:05.493
No, chef.
No, chef.

19:05.528 --> 19:06.761
Ugh.

19:16.751 --> 19:18.584
Right, Kaitlyn,
what's the dish tonight?

19:18.619 --> 19:19.585
What's the signature dish?

19:19.620 --> 19:20.786
I'm making my version

19:20.821 --> 19:22.187
of black forest cupcakes.

19:22.223 --> 19:24.156
And how are you going
to lift this cupcake?

19:24.191 --> 19:25.858
I'm making a raspberry coulis.

19:25.893 --> 19:28.027
And the coulis goes
inside the cupcake, or...

19:28.062 --> 19:29.261
I might drizzle it on top,

19:29.297 --> 19:31.163
or I might put it
inside the cupcake.

19:31.198 --> 19:32.598
Wow, okay.

19:32.633 --> 19:33.777
Are you confident this dish

19:33.801 --> 19:35.078
is good enough
to stay in the competition?

19:35.102 --> 19:36.168
- Yes, chef.
- Why?

19:36.203 --> 19:37.936
Because I think it really
represents me,

19:37.972 --> 19:40.205
and I think I can
execute it very well.

19:40.241 --> 19:41.674
Now, with a simple cupcake,

19:41.709 --> 19:43.620
make sure it's the best cupcake
you've ever made.

19:43.644 --> 19:44.877
Yes, chef.

19:44.912 --> 19:46.223
You're up against
tough competition tonight.

19:46.247 --> 19:47.457
You've got 45 minutes remaining.

19:47.481 --> 19:49.982
- Good luck.
- Thank you, chef.

19:50.017 --> 19:53.085
I've been making my chocolate
cupcakes for years,

19:53.120 --> 19:56.288
so I know I can take
this cupcake to the next level

19:56.324 --> 19:58.824
to prove to them that I'm
the next masterchef junior.

19:58.859 --> 20:00.626
Yay.

20:00.661 --> 20:02.294
Let's do this thing.

20:06.167 --> 20:08.867
Amaya, your sauce
smells so good.

20:08.903 --> 20:10.736
Thank you.

20:10.771 --> 20:12.071
- Hi, Amaya.
- Hello.

20:12.106 --> 20:13.072
What are you doing?

20:13.107 --> 20:14.640
I'm smushing these plantains.

20:14.675 --> 20:16.175
Oh, you're smushing them.

20:16.210 --> 20:17.810
I'm gonna put them in the fryer.

20:17.845 --> 20:19.356
All right,
tell me about the dish

20:19.380 --> 20:21.647
that you're making tonight
for us as your signature dish.

20:21.682 --> 20:24.483
I am making a shrimp asopao.

20:24.518 --> 20:28.187
It's the name of this stew
from the Dominican Republic.

20:28.222 --> 20:30.289
And today I've decided
to make it with shrimp.

20:30.324 --> 20:31.590
I love that.

20:31.625 --> 20:33.170
I'm gonna read a little bit
of your cookbook,

20:33.194 --> 20:35.728
"Amaya's amazing book
of recipes."

20:35.763 --> 20:37.663
"I would like a school
for all the arts.

20:37.698 --> 20:42.067
"I will have classes
for cooking, singing, dancing,

20:42.103 --> 20:44.803
painting,
and playing an instrument."

20:44.839 --> 20:46.138
Do you do all these things?

20:46.173 --> 20:47.439
Yes.

20:47.475 --> 20:48.752
So you're kind of like a woman

20:48.776 --> 20:50.542
that's super well-rounded
that can do it all.

20:50.578 --> 20:51.643
Kind of like you.

20:51.679 --> 20:52.945
Kind of like me.

20:54.048 --> 20:55.314
All right, good luck, mama.

20:55.349 --> 20:56.515
Thank you.

21:02.256 --> 21:04.690
Right, kya,
this is a big one tonight.

21:04.725 --> 21:05.691
What's the dish you're cooking?

21:05.726 --> 21:07.059
Canard à I'orange.

21:07.094 --> 21:09.461
Oh, canard à I'orange,
duck à I'orange.

21:09.497 --> 21:10.462
Yes.

21:10.498 --> 21:11.630
Look at you,
all fancy-pants.

21:11.665 --> 21:13.065
How are you modernizing this?

21:13.100 --> 21:14.900
What's kya's twist
on this duck à I'orange?

21:14.935 --> 21:17.703
I'm doing an orange
and fennel salad to go with it.

21:17.738 --> 21:19.238
Right, oh, okay.

21:19.273 --> 21:22.441
And then I'm also doing
a sweet potato fondant.

21:22.476 --> 21:25.878
Wow, you are
incredibly creative.

21:25.913 --> 21:27.312
Where does this come from?

21:27.348 --> 21:28.414
Myself.

21:28.449 --> 21:29.659
Are you gonna skewer
the duck breast

21:29.683 --> 21:30.694
before you start cooking it?

21:30.718 --> 21:32.951
Yes, I like how it looks,
and then, also,

21:32.987 --> 21:34.831
it can help to render
the palate a little bit more.

21:34.855 --> 21:35.855
That's right.

21:35.890 --> 21:37.033
- Confident with this dish?
- Yes.

21:37.057 --> 21:40.225
- Right, young lady, good luck.
- Thank you.

21:46.967 --> 21:48.734
Addison, what are you making?

21:48.769 --> 21:50.302
Addison's signature dish.

21:50.337 --> 21:52.738
Tonight I'm making
apple passion fruit danishes

21:52.773 --> 21:54.807
on a homemade puff pastry,

21:54.842 --> 21:57.142
and then orange
and passion fruit whipped cream.

21:57.178 --> 21:59.344
Where did you come up
with that combination

21:59.380 --> 22:02.514
of green apple
and passion fruit?

22:02.550 --> 22:04.516
I definitely wanted to show
that making

22:04.552 --> 22:07.052
a delicious but bold dessert

22:07.087 --> 22:09.388
can really give you
a chance at winning.

22:09.423 --> 22:10.556
Good luck.

22:12.927 --> 22:15.394
Less than 15 minutes remaining.

22:15.429 --> 22:16.962
Come on, you can do this.

22:16.997 --> 22:18.297
Right, kamilly, how you doing?

22:18.332 --> 22:19.731
I'm good, sir.
How are you?

22:19.767 --> 22:20.732
Very well, indeed, thank you.

22:20.768 --> 22:22.167
Describe the dish.

22:22.203 --> 22:23.380
It's really called
the dreadlock jerk chicken.

22:23.404 --> 22:24.803
Jerk chicken, okay, great.

22:24.839 --> 22:26.583
So you've taken it in a sort of
Caribbean way, right?

22:26.607 --> 22:27.873
Yes.

22:27.908 --> 22:29.786
And does you family have roots
from the Caribbean?

22:29.810 --> 22:32.411
Yes, my dad was born
in St. Thomas originally.

22:32.446 --> 22:33.512
Right, now what's in here?

22:33.547 --> 22:34.580
What's this sauce?

22:34.615 --> 22:36.181
In here, I call it
my rasta sauce.

22:36.217 --> 22:37.449
Wow, what's in there?

22:37.485 --> 22:40.586
Well, it is tomatoes
and habanero peppers.

22:40.621 --> 22:41.731
How did you cook the chicken?

22:41.755 --> 22:43.055
I basted it and marinated it,

22:43.090 --> 22:45.090
and then I put it in the oven
for 35 minutes.

22:45.125 --> 22:46.470
So then I took it out,
and then I pan-seared it.

22:46.494 --> 22:47.571
Make sure that's cooked, yeah?

22:47.595 --> 22:48.927
Yes, chef.

22:48.963 --> 22:50.207
And this is you on a plate.
This is you at your best.

22:50.231 --> 22:51.563
- Yes.
- good luck.

22:51.599 --> 22:52.731
Thank you, chef.

22:55.936 --> 22:57.469
Right, signature dishes.

22:57.505 --> 22:58.604
- Kya.
- mm-hmm.

22:58.639 --> 23:00.172
Brace yourself.

23:00.207 --> 23:01.251
She is doing
a duck à I'orange...

23:01.275 --> 23:02.808
- No.
- with a sweet potato fondant,

23:02.843 --> 23:06.211
and caramelizing sugar
to do a perfect orange sauce.

23:06.247 --> 23:07.646
Stop.

23:07.681 --> 23:09.226
You know, if they get
these signature dishes correct,

23:09.250 --> 23:10.861
you know, they can go on
to inspire millions.

23:10.885 --> 23:12.085
Right, and with Avery,

23:12.119 --> 23:14.052
it sounds totally
like an Avery dish, right?

23:14.088 --> 23:15.654
It's, you know,
crawfish étouffée.

23:15.689 --> 23:17.667
I'm just expecting her
to knock it out of the park.

23:17.691 --> 23:19.725
This bayou thing runs
in my veins.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.159
I got this in the bag.

23:21.195 --> 23:23.328
Addison is going
down the dessert route,

23:23.364 --> 23:26.064
passion fruit
and green apple Danish.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.065
It's bold.

23:27.101 --> 23:28.066
I think she's giving us

23:28.102 --> 23:29.468
an unlikely flavor combination.

23:29.503 --> 23:31.036
But she's gonna have
to pull it off.

23:31.071 --> 23:32.349
Yeah, on the other hand,

23:32.373 --> 23:33.839
I'm slightly concerned
about Kaitlyn,

23:33.874 --> 23:36.408
because she's doing
a single chocolate cupcake.

23:36.443 --> 23:37.621
But, you know, we've seen

23:37.645 --> 23:38.977
some amazing dishes out of her.

23:39.013 --> 23:42.047
I think Kaitlyn's completely
capable of pulling it off.

23:42.082 --> 23:43.315
Uh-huh.

23:43.350 --> 23:46.652
I mean, it's gonna have to be
a phenomenal cupcake.

23:46.687 --> 23:48.820
Less than five minutes to go.

23:48.856 --> 23:50.923
I'd like all of you
to speed up, please.

23:50.958 --> 23:53.292
Start thinking about plating.

23:53.327 --> 23:54.693
Agh!

23:54.728 --> 23:57.262
What's going on with Addison?

23:57.298 --> 24:00.232
Did I over-whip this?

24:00.267 --> 24:01.800
Ooh, that's over-whipped.

24:01.835 --> 24:03.068
Oh, my God.

24:03.103 --> 24:04.169
Dang it.

24:04.204 --> 24:05.837
<i>Time is running out,</i>

24:05.873 --> 24:09.408
and my whipped cream
is over-whipped.

24:09.443 --> 24:11.443
Oh, no, what am I gonna do?

24:11.478 --> 24:14.012
<i>Wasn't paying
attention to my whipped cream.</i>

24:14.048 --> 24:16.915
It's just chunky,
and I have to throw it away.

24:16.951 --> 24:18.150
Shoot.

24:18.185 --> 24:20.953
<i>This is my signature dish,</i>

24:20.988 --> 24:24.623
and I don't have any more
heavy cream to restart it.

24:24.658 --> 24:26.358
Wow.

24:26.393 --> 24:27.693
Oh, my gosh.

24:31.693 --> 24:34.694
Less than five minutes to go!

24:34.729 --> 24:36.696
I'd like all of you
to speed up, please.

24:36.731 --> 24:38.731
Start thinking about plating.

24:38.767 --> 24:40.100
Agh!

24:40.135 --> 24:42.635
What's going on with Addison?

24:42.671 --> 24:43.770
Ugh.

24:43.805 --> 24:45.238
Ooh, that's over-whipped.

24:45.273 --> 24:46.906
Oh, my God.

24:46.942 --> 24:49.609
<i>My whipped
cream is over-whipped.</i>

24:49.644 --> 24:51.211
<i>It's gonna be a disaster,</i>

24:51.246 --> 24:54.948
because I don't have any more
heavy cream to restart it.

24:54.983 --> 24:55.949
Oh, my gosh.

24:55.984 --> 24:57.183
How's it coming, Addie?

24:57.219 --> 24:58.463
Do you have any extra
heavy cream?

24:58.487 --> 24:59.597
Because I got to start over.

24:59.621 --> 25:00.753
Girl, I have, like,

25:00.789 --> 25:02.288
three extra bottles
of heavy cream.

25:02.324 --> 25:03.334
I can use your heavy cream?

25:03.358 --> 25:06.359
- Yeah.
- oh, my gosh.

25:06.394 --> 25:07.894
Thank God.

25:07.929 --> 25:09.329
Hurry up, guys.

25:09.364 --> 25:12.365
<i>Kaitlyn just
saved my whole life.</i>

25:12.400 --> 25:14.100
But time is ticking,

25:14.136 --> 25:16.169
<i>and it's just running away.</i>

25:16.204 --> 25:20.807
And I'm not gonna let the one
thing that I'm really good at

25:20.842 --> 25:22.775
<i>totally throw me under the bus.</i>

25:22.811 --> 25:25.845
Wow.

25:25.881 --> 25:30.016
Guys, two minutes to go.

25:30.051 --> 25:32.619
You need to think about plating,
if you haven't already.

25:32.654 --> 25:37.123
Remember, we are looking
for you on a plate.

25:37.159 --> 25:38.124
Come on, guys.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.526
I got to go fast.

25:39.561 --> 25:41.828
A chance for you all to shine

25:41.863 --> 25:45.131
and cook the very best
signature dish

25:45.167 --> 25:46.900
from your future cookbook.

25:49.471 --> 25:50.670
30 seconds to go,

25:50.705 --> 25:52.839
and for two of you,
it is your last 30 seconds

25:52.874 --> 25:54.707
in the masterchef kitchen.

25:54.743 --> 25:55.808
I'm scared to do this.

25:55.844 --> 25:57.377
I don't want to mess it up.

25:57.412 --> 25:59.512
Finishing touches.

25:59.548 --> 26:02.115
Ten, nine, eight,

26:02.150 --> 26:05.852
seven, six, five, four,

26:05.887 --> 26:08.188
three, two, one.

26:08.223 --> 26:10.657
And stop, hands in the air.

26:10.692 --> 26:12.025
- Well done.
- Nice job, guys.

26:12.060 --> 26:13.826
- Nice job, guys.
- Whoo.

26:13.862 --> 26:15.495
Great job, everybody.

26:15.530 --> 26:16.963
Now, in tonight's challenge,

26:16.998 --> 26:20.633
we asked all of you
to make us your signature dish

26:20.669 --> 26:22.135
from that future cookbook.

26:22.170 --> 26:25.471
It's now time to see how well
you did with those dishes.

26:25.507 --> 26:29.275
First up, from Louisiana, Avery.

26:29.311 --> 26:30.655
<i>I think my dish looks great.</i>

26:30.679 --> 26:32.779
This thing looks like
the cover of my cookbook.

26:32.814 --> 26:36.149
<i>I cannot wait for the judges
to get a taste of the bayou.</i>

26:36.184 --> 26:37.150
all right, Avery,

26:37.185 --> 26:38.418
what is this dish,

26:38.453 --> 26:40.253
and why is it you on a plate?

26:40.288 --> 26:43.523
I made a crawfish étouffée
with steamed rice,

26:43.558 --> 26:46.326
and this is me
because I love crawfish,

26:46.361 --> 26:48.661
and I catch crawfish
in my backyard.

26:48.697 --> 26:51.064
So how many times
have you made this?

26:51.099 --> 26:52.799
About a thousand with my papa.

26:52.834 --> 26:54.267
Love that.

26:54.302 --> 26:55.802
So your sauce looks
nice and thick.

26:55.837 --> 26:58.504
The color is exactly
that sort of, like,

26:58.540 --> 27:01.207
bayou, stew-y color.

27:05.513 --> 27:08.548
Whoo.

27:08.583 --> 27:11.384
I absolutely love it.

27:11.419 --> 27:12.752
One second.

27:12.787 --> 27:14.954
Yes, yes!

27:14.990 --> 27:17.223
Your sauce
coated the rice nicely.

27:17.259 --> 27:19.892
There's a nice amount of
seasoning all the way through.

27:19.928 --> 27:23.263
I love how generous you were
with that crawfish.

27:23.298 --> 27:26.232
It's strong, and it's bold,

27:26.268 --> 27:28.768
and it just stands there proud,
just like you.

27:28.803 --> 27:33.439
- Nice job.
- Thank you, chef.

27:33.475 --> 27:36.175
Right, visually,
it looks delicious.

27:36.211 --> 27:37.710
It's got that
authenticity to it.

27:37.746 --> 27:39.090
What heat did you use
in this thing?

27:39.114 --> 27:42.248
I did cayenne,
a little bit of paprika,

27:42.284 --> 27:43.383
and salt and pepper.

27:43.418 --> 27:44.951
Mm, have you tasted this?

27:44.986 --> 27:46.819
I have not tasted them
together, chef.

27:46.855 --> 27:49.188
A great chef
always tastes their food.

27:49.224 --> 27:51.691
Describe that.

27:51.726 --> 27:54.661
Wow, that tastes like my papa's.

27:54.696 --> 27:55.936
I think you've made papa proud.

27:55.964 --> 27:57.141
Seriously, the heat's right.

27:57.165 --> 27:58.965
The crawfish
are cooked beautifully.

27:59.000 --> 27:59.966
Thank you, chef.

28:00.001 --> 28:00.967
One question.

28:01.002 --> 28:01.968
Can I have the recipe, please?

28:02.003 --> 28:03.903
- Yes, chef.
- How much?

28:03.938 --> 28:05.338
I'll give it to you for free.

28:05.373 --> 28:07.840
You've got to charge
for your recipes.

28:07.876 --> 28:11.811
That is what I call
a signature dish.

28:11.846 --> 28:13.046
Great job, thank you.

28:13.081 --> 28:14.681
Good job, Avery!

28:14.716 --> 28:16.049
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

28:16.084 --> 28:19.052
<i>I mean, nobody in the bayou
would believe</i>

28:19.087 --> 28:22.722
Gordon ramsay wants to buy
my recipe.

28:22.757 --> 28:24.557
<i>I mean, wow.</i>

28:25.727 --> 28:27.894
Next up, please, kya.

28:27.929 --> 28:30.363
Whoo, go, kya!

28:30.398 --> 28:31.676
<i>I'm feeling pretty confident,</i>

28:31.700 --> 28:34.033
<i>because this is one
of my favorite dishes,</i>

28:34.069 --> 28:36.269
<i>and it's a French classic.</i>

28:36.304 --> 28:39.639
And I put my own little spin
to it, so I got this.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.074
Wowzers.

28:41.109 --> 28:44.043
Somebody remembered to wear
their fancy pants today.

28:45.080 --> 28:46.045
Ooh la la.

28:46.081 --> 28:47.081
What do we have?

28:47.115 --> 28:49.916
Today, I made a duck à I'orange,

28:49.951 --> 28:52.151
and then there's
an orange fennel salad

28:52.187 --> 28:54.520
with dried Cranberries
and a sweet potato fondant.

28:54.556 --> 28:56.389
- Were you born in France?
- No.

28:56.424 --> 28:57.757
- Are you French?
- No.

28:57.792 --> 28:59.492
- Have you been to France?
- No.

28:59.527 --> 29:01.227
- Do you speak French?
- No.

29:01.262 --> 29:03.140
Then how are you
cooking French classics?

29:03.164 --> 29:05.598
I mean, this looks
super technical,

29:05.633 --> 29:08.401
not just with the ingredients
and the cook that you have,

29:08.436 --> 29:10.036
but look at the presentation.

29:10.071 --> 29:11.571
I love French food.

29:11.606 --> 29:14.974
To me, it's the best cuisine.

29:15.009 --> 29:18.711
The cook on the duck,
crispy, mid-rare, amazing.

29:18.747 --> 29:20.346
The potato fondant, caramelized,

29:20.382 --> 29:21.647
nice and moist in the middle.

29:21.683 --> 29:23.327
The only thing
that can maybe use some work,

29:23.351 --> 29:24.817
the fennel.

29:24.853 --> 29:27.387
It's still crunchy because of
how thick it is cut, right?

29:27.422 --> 29:28.955
You want it to be
really paper-thin.

29:28.990 --> 29:31.858
Everything else on the dish,
though, makes me want to like...

29:31.893 --> 29:32.893
Kya!

29:33.928 --> 29:34.894
Because it's that good.

29:34.929 --> 29:35.895
Thank you.

29:35.930 --> 29:38.498
- Good job, kya.
- Kya.

29:38.533 --> 29:40.199
Great job.
Amazing job.

29:40.235 --> 29:43.236
Right, next up, Kaitlyn,
let's go.

29:43.271 --> 29:44.815
<i>I see that
everyone else around me</i>

29:44.839 --> 29:47.240
<i>made amazing signature dishes,</i>

29:47.275 --> 29:50.042
and I'm kind of second-guessing
myself right now,

29:50.078 --> 29:52.123
<i>because maybe I should have
made one of my Korean dishes</i>

29:52.147 --> 29:53.346
<i>instead of my cupcake.</i>

29:53.381 --> 29:55.548
Right, young lady,
describe the dish, please.

29:55.583 --> 29:58.818
I decided to do my version
of a black forest cupcake

29:58.853 --> 30:01.220
using raspberries
instead of cherries.

30:01.256 --> 30:04.023
Right, now, I'm
gonna be really honest.

30:04.058 --> 30:05.158
You're in the top ten.

30:05.193 --> 30:06.670
You've done brilliantly well
to get here.

30:06.694 --> 30:08.594
You have blown my palate away

30:08.630 --> 30:10.596
so many times
in this competition.

30:10.632 --> 30:12.298
And what frustrates me
is that I see

30:12.333 --> 30:14.700
duck à I'orange, étouffée,

30:14.736 --> 30:17.603
and I see a cupcake.

30:17.639 --> 30:19.405
I'm seriously worried.

30:19.441 --> 30:23.543
It's not a dish.

30:23.578 --> 30:26.045
Oh, dear.

30:33.254 --> 30:35.488
That is not a dish.

30:35.523 --> 30:38.024
And I don't think
it's Kaitlyn on a plate.

30:38.059 --> 30:40.326
Everybody else behind you
have done dishes.

30:40.361 --> 30:42.328
So if you're gonna do
a dessert as a dish,

30:42.363 --> 30:45.765
it needs to be phenomenal.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.467
So, it looks very light.

30:47.502 --> 30:48.634
Was that the idea?

30:48.670 --> 30:49.902
Yes, chef.

30:49.938 --> 30:52.472
And then the butter icing,
what's the ratio?

30:52.507 --> 30:56.442
Two parts sugar
and one part butter.

31:00.315 --> 31:01.659
You know, it's rich, it's gooey,

31:01.683 --> 31:03.883
it's very chocolaty
in the center,

31:03.918 --> 31:06.953
but the frosting deserves
to be on a slice of toast.

31:06.988 --> 31:08.488
It is so buttery,

31:08.523 --> 31:11.224
I feel like I've got
a mouthful of grease.

31:11.259 --> 31:13.993
If I asked you to go back and
cook one of your Korean dishes,

31:14.028 --> 31:15.261
what would you do?

31:15.296 --> 31:17.463
I probably would have made
Korean fried calamari.

31:17.499 --> 31:18.931
- Ooh.
- sounds great.

31:18.967 --> 31:20.233
That's a dish for me,

31:20.268 --> 31:23.035
because your skill level
is way better than a cupcake.

31:23.071 --> 31:25.004
This was months ago,

31:25.039 --> 31:26.283
and I don't think tonight,
my darling,

31:26.307 --> 31:27.940
this is you at your best.

31:27.976 --> 31:29.408
Thank you.

31:30.912 --> 31:32.879
Great job, Kaitlyn.

31:38.953 --> 31:41.854
Next up, please, Amaya.

31:41.890 --> 31:44.824
- Come on, Amaya!
- Whoo!

31:44.859 --> 31:46.826
<i>Everything in my
dish came out perfectly,</i>

31:46.861 --> 31:48.239
<i>and I'm feeling
really, really good.</i>

31:48.263 --> 31:50.129
I think that the judges
will really like

31:50.165 --> 31:51.764
this simple Dominican dish.

31:51.799 --> 31:53.533
- That's beautiful.
- Look at that.

31:53.568 --> 31:55.701
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

31:55.737 --> 31:57.648
It looks like I'm on, like,
the little s.S. Amaya,

31:57.672 --> 31:59.505
like your little boat
of goodies here.

31:59.541 --> 32:01.307
What do we have?

32:01.342 --> 32:03.609
This is a Dominican asopao,

32:03.645 --> 32:06.212
which is a rice and shrimp stew,

32:06.247 --> 32:08.848
with friend plantains
called tostones.

32:08.883 --> 32:09.916
Those are these.

32:09.951 --> 32:11.551
So walk me through
some of the steps.

32:11.586 --> 32:13.853
So I made an escovitch,

32:13.888 --> 32:15.655
added seafood stock,

32:15.690 --> 32:17.924
then I added my rice,

32:17.959 --> 32:19.792
and after the rice
opened up a little,

32:19.827 --> 32:22.995
I added the shrimp.

32:23.031 --> 32:26.365
Amaya, this is...

32:26.401 --> 32:27.667
Amazing.

32:27.702 --> 32:28.801
Thank you.

32:28.836 --> 32:30.147
It's so good,
it's so thought-out.

32:30.171 --> 32:31.515
It has so much
heart and soul in it.

32:31.539 --> 32:32.939
And it is what we
were asking for.

32:32.974 --> 32:35.408
But the thing
that stands out the most,

32:35.443 --> 32:37.476
these shrimp, these camarones,

32:37.512 --> 32:39.078
are cooked to perfection.

32:39.113 --> 32:40.980
I mean, it's hard
for professional cooks

32:41.015 --> 32:42.055
to get them done that way.

32:42.083 --> 32:43.049
Is that a fluke?

32:43.084 --> 32:44.050
Is this, like, just a...

32:44.085 --> 32:45.051
No, chef.

32:45.086 --> 32:46.363
You getting lucky kind of thing?

32:46.387 --> 32:47.486
Never.

32:47.522 --> 32:48.632
You went above and beyond here.

32:48.656 --> 32:51.691
- Thank you, chef Graham.
- Good job.

32:51.726 --> 32:53.726
Why does this dish say Amaya?

32:53.761 --> 32:55.294
Why did you choose this dish?

32:55.330 --> 32:57.530
My mother taught me the recipe,

32:57.565 --> 32:59.565
and the first asopao I ever had

32:59.601 --> 33:01.767
was from my grandmother.

33:01.803 --> 33:04.337
You know, the depth of flavor

33:04.372 --> 33:07.640
that you managed to build
over 60 minutes

33:07.675 --> 33:11.844
tastes like you've been
standing over the stove all day.

33:11.879 --> 33:14.614
There's complexity,
there's dimension.

33:14.649 --> 33:16.616
It's very, very deep.

33:16.651 --> 33:17.984
- Thank you, chef.
- Good job.

33:19.287 --> 33:20.886
- Good job, Amaya.
- Good job, Amaya.

33:20.922 --> 33:21.887
Thank you.

33:21.923 --> 33:23.489
- So good.
- Are you kidding me?

33:23.524 --> 33:24.624
Perfectly her.

33:24.659 --> 33:27.260
Yeah, exactly.

33:27.295 --> 33:29.028
Next up, jj, please, let's go.

33:29.063 --> 33:31.330
Bring me your signature dish,
young man.

33:31.366 --> 33:33.566
It is fettuccine

33:33.601 --> 33:37.203
with a cream sauce
and grilled chicken.

33:40.541 --> 33:41.507
This is just good.

33:41.542 --> 33:42.508
Fettuccine's delicious.

33:42.543 --> 33:43.509
It's seasoned beautifully.

33:43.544 --> 33:44.588
The cream sauce is not too rich.

33:44.612 --> 33:46.045
However, is that you?

33:46.080 --> 33:47.625
Because I thought we were
gonna braise a rib,

33:47.649 --> 33:49.982
or tri-tip
barbecue flank steak.

33:50.018 --> 33:51.951
So I was just disappointed.

33:51.986 --> 33:53.119
Thank you.

33:53.154 --> 33:55.321
Next up, Sam.

33:55.356 --> 33:57.156
Please describe your dish.

33:57.191 --> 33:58.302
It's a chicken wrapped in bacon

33:58.326 --> 34:00.493
with couscous and artichoke.

34:00.528 --> 34:02.762
Beautiful skill
with those artichokes.

34:02.797 --> 34:04.430
That takes a lot of time.

34:08.101 --> 34:09.068
Great flavor.

34:09.103 --> 34:10.268
Moist chicken.

34:10.304 --> 34:12.438
You got the bacon around it,
gives it some smokiness.

34:12.473 --> 34:13.438
You know, this is you in a bowl,

34:13.474 --> 34:14.485
which is what we asked for.

34:14.509 --> 34:15.574
- Good job.
- Thanks.

34:15.610 --> 34:17.743
Next up, Addison.

34:17.779 --> 34:20.179
I've made an apple
passion fruit Danish

34:20.214 --> 34:22.848
with a orange
and passion fruit whipped cream.

34:22.884 --> 34:24.283
You made the pastry yourself,

34:24.319 --> 34:26.018
or it's a puff pastry
that you got?

34:26.054 --> 34:28.020
So I decided to make my own.

34:34.161 --> 34:35.428
The flavor is great.

34:35.463 --> 34:36.929
It's bold, it's fresh,
it's bright.

34:36.964 --> 34:38.164
That's Addison.

34:38.199 --> 34:40.433
But the thing
that's disappointing is,

34:40.467 --> 34:43.402
visually, this dessert
is pretty flat.

34:43.438 --> 34:46.938
I'm just worried that this,
as your signature dish,

34:46.974 --> 34:48.306
may not represent

34:48.342 --> 34:49.853
how great of a cook
that we know that you are.

34:49.877 --> 34:51.777
Thank you, chef.

34:51.813 --> 34:54.947
<i>Wow, if Addison is looking
bad in front of the judges...</i>

34:54.982 --> 34:56.126
She is one
of the best chefs here.

34:56.150 --> 35:01.320
I mean, this competition
is getting brutal.

35:01.356 --> 35:02.388
And finally,

35:02.423 --> 35:03.556
Corey, let's go.

35:03.591 --> 35:04.557
Yes, chef.

35:04.592 --> 35:06.359
- Come on, Corey!
- Go, Corey.

35:06.394 --> 35:08.361
<i>Corey's signature
dish looks so good.</i>

35:08.396 --> 35:11.297
<i>I mean, it has, you know,
very Jamaican style.</i>

35:11.332 --> 35:12.531
Wow, wow, wow.

35:12.567 --> 35:13.999
<i>That's very special,</i>

35:14.035 --> 35:15.546
that he's making something
from his culture.

35:15.570 --> 35:16.736
Describe the dish, please.

35:16.771 --> 35:19.038
Well, I have what I call
the dreadlock jerk chicken,

35:19.073 --> 35:22.675
with red rice and beans,
carrots, and a rasta sauce.

35:22.710 --> 35:23.843
Okay, great.

35:23.878 --> 35:25.511
How long did you
cook the carrots for?

35:25.546 --> 35:27.813
A minute on each side.

35:27.849 --> 35:29.615
Ooh, is that still raw there?

35:29.650 --> 35:31.450
When you got carrots
looking that delicious,

35:31.486 --> 35:33.185
I expect them to be
nice and soft and sweet

35:33.221 --> 35:34.887
and sort of almost roasted,

35:34.922 --> 35:37.189
because you've got
a lovely glaze on the carrots.

35:37.225 --> 35:39.492
What's the seasoning
in the rice and beans?

35:39.527 --> 35:40.893
It is salt and pepper.

35:40.928 --> 35:42.728
Mm, let me get this chicken.

35:42.764 --> 35:43.974
How long did you cook this for?

35:43.998 --> 35:46.432
First, I baked
it for about 35 minutes,

35:46.467 --> 35:48.267
then I pan-seared it.

35:48.302 --> 35:51.404
Wow, what is going on here?

35:51.439 --> 35:53.239
Are you sure you cooked it
for 35 minutes?

35:53.274 --> 35:54.940
Yes, chef.

35:54.976 --> 35:56.208
Was the oven on?

35:56.244 --> 35:57.610
Yes, chef.

35:57.645 --> 35:59.745
- You sure?
- Yes.

36:02.283 --> 36:04.417
Damn.

36:04.452 --> 36:05.551
Oh.

36:05.586 --> 36:07.386
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

36:14.550 --> 36:17.885
Wow, what is going on here?

36:17.920 --> 36:19.720
Are you sure you cooked it
for 35 minutes?

36:19.755 --> 36:20.888
Yes.

36:24.293 --> 36:25.392
Raw chicken.

36:25.428 --> 36:26.393
Oh.

36:26.429 --> 36:28.362
Damn.

36:28.397 --> 36:30.097
Are you sure
that oven was on, Corey?

36:30.132 --> 36:33.801
Yes, chef.

36:33.836 --> 36:36.904
I cannot believe that was
in the oven for 35 minutes.

36:36.939 --> 36:39.540
When you have two
thighs and two drums,

36:39.575 --> 36:40.752
what's the one thing
you should do

36:40.776 --> 36:42.454
with the other one
that you're not serving?

36:42.478 --> 36:45.513
Cut it open to check
to see if it's cooked.

36:45.548 --> 36:47.648
I love the concept,

36:47.683 --> 36:49.717
in terms of you trying
to bring your background

36:49.752 --> 36:53.621
and that kind of personality
to the plate.

36:53.656 --> 36:55.990
Unfortunately,
the execution was sub-par,

36:56.025 --> 36:57.769
and the chicken's raw,
so I can't taste that.

36:57.793 --> 37:00.427
- You know that.
- Yes, chef.

37:00.463 --> 37:02.630
Thank you.

37:02.665 --> 37:03.709
<i>I don't know what went wrong.</i>

37:03.733 --> 37:04.899
<i>I mean, I could have sworn</i>

37:04.934 --> 37:07.268
<i>that I was cooking
the chicken perfectly.</i>

37:07.303 --> 37:09.169
I am not ready
to go back to Arizona.

37:09.205 --> 37:11.705
I have so much more
to show these judges.

37:13.743 --> 37:16.911
Sadly, we're going to
have to say good-bye to some of you.

37:16.946 --> 37:18.646
We're gonna need a moment
to discuss.

37:18.681 --> 37:20.114
Excuse us.

37:23.319 --> 37:26.086
You did a great job.

37:26.122 --> 37:27.733
Avery and Amaya,
come on, seriously.

37:27.757 --> 37:28.789
The étouffée,

37:28.824 --> 37:30.457
and then her take on the stew,

37:30.493 --> 37:31.493
brilliant dishes.

37:31.527 --> 37:32.604
Both of those dishes taste like

37:32.628 --> 37:34.662
they were made
by professional chefs.

37:34.697 --> 37:35.663
- Right.
- yeah.

37:35.698 --> 37:36.775
Addison has been at the top.

37:36.799 --> 37:38.365
That little tart...

37:38.401 --> 37:39.800
It was incredibly underwhelming.

37:39.835 --> 37:41.902
Sure. Kaitlyn's
was badly conceptualized.

37:41.938 --> 37:43.315
She could have
done so much more.

37:43.339 --> 37:44.738
One cupcake?

37:44.774 --> 37:47.074
I wish I would have stuck
with the calamari.

37:47.109 --> 37:48.142
Happy with the decision?

37:48.177 --> 37:49.343
- Yes.
- 100%.

37:49.378 --> 37:50.811
Let's go.

37:55.351 --> 37:57.017
Oh, my gosh.

37:57.053 --> 37:58.719
We are so proud

37:58.754 --> 38:00.666
of how all of you guys did
with tonight's challenge.

38:00.690 --> 38:01.789
It was a big one.

38:01.824 --> 38:03.757
But there were two dishes

38:03.793 --> 38:07.661
that stood out above the rest.

38:07.697 --> 38:08.662
Amaya...

38:08.698 --> 38:09.663
Thank you.

38:09.699 --> 38:11.198
- Congrats.
- whoo!

38:11.233 --> 38:12.533
Whoo!

38:12.568 --> 38:16.637
And a huge congrats
for a stunning dish,

38:16.672 --> 38:17.771
Avery.

38:17.807 --> 38:18.839
Yo!

38:20.309 --> 38:22.276
<i>I know that
Louisiana would be proud.</i>

38:22.311 --> 38:25.145
I am in the top eight,
and it is crazy.

38:25.181 --> 38:26.213
Good job, Avery.

38:26.248 --> 38:27.915
<i>But I also know</i>

38:27.950 --> 38:30.851
<i>that two of my friends
right now could be going home,</i>

38:30.886 --> 38:33.387
and I'm really sad about that.

38:33.422 --> 38:35.789
Will the following
three home cooks

38:35.825 --> 38:37.891
please make their way
down to the front?

38:37.927 --> 38:41.228
Corey.

38:41.263 --> 38:45.199
Addison.

38:45.234 --> 38:47.901
And Kaitlyn, please.

38:52.608 --> 38:54.375
Corey, Addison, and Kaitlyn,

38:54.410 --> 38:57.011
tonight wasn't
your best performance

38:57.046 --> 39:01.215
inside the masterchef kitchen.

39:01.250 --> 39:04.351
One of you did just enough

39:04.387 --> 39:08.689
to stay in this competition.

39:08.724 --> 39:10.691
Step forward...

39:16.899 --> 39:18.032
Addison.

39:18.067 --> 39:19.767
Oh, my God.

39:19.802 --> 39:22.102
Oh, my God.

39:22.138 --> 39:23.170
Young lady...

39:23.205 --> 39:24.505
Oh, my God.

39:24.540 --> 39:26.485
Please say good
night to Kaitlyn and Corey

39:26.509 --> 39:28.108
and make your way
back to your station.

39:28.144 --> 39:30.477
You guys are amazing cooks.

39:30.513 --> 39:33.147
Good night, Addison.

39:33.182 --> 39:34.148
Bye, Addison.

39:34.183 --> 39:35.349
Oh, my God.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.820
Be strong, Kaitlyn.
You can do this.

39:39.855 --> 39:41.155
Okay?

39:44.026 --> 39:46.794
Oh, my God.

39:46.829 --> 39:48.629
You two, I think you know
what this means.

39:48.664 --> 39:53.500
Unfortunately, tonight,
it just wasn't enough.

39:53.536 --> 39:57.971
Corey, tonight your chicken
was simply not cooked.

39:58.007 --> 39:59.606
Kaitlyn, your cupcake

39:59.642 --> 40:03.177
had many technical flaws
with it.

40:03.212 --> 40:06.714
But this is not the end
of your culinary journey.

40:06.749 --> 40:08.649
This is the first step.

40:08.684 --> 40:10.284
You have to keep cooking.

40:10.319 --> 40:12.252
You guys are so talented.

40:12.288 --> 40:14.455
Kaitlyn, Corey, please,

40:14.490 --> 40:18.325
both of you, come up here
and say good-bye.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.993
Head up high, my darling, yeah?

40:20.029 --> 40:21.069
- Great job, Corey.
- Okay?

40:21.097 --> 40:22.062
- It's all right, dear.
- Best of luck.

40:22.098 --> 40:23.063
Head up high.

40:23.099 --> 40:24.231
Corey.

40:24.266 --> 40:26.133
Well done.

40:26.168 --> 40:27.301
Good night, guys.

40:33.776 --> 40:35.576
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

40:35.611 --> 40:36.844
We're gonna miss you.

40:36.879 --> 40:38.512
You did great, Corey.

40:38.547 --> 40:40.714
- Bye, everyone.
- Bye, guys.

40:40.750 --> 40:42.950
I'm sad to go back home
to Arizona,

40:42.985 --> 40:47.087
but it was amazing just walking
into the masterchef kitchen.

40:47.123 --> 40:48.522
This is so amazing!

40:48.557 --> 40:51.024
<i>I got a chance
to reach my dreams.</i>

40:51.060 --> 40:52.993
your chicken tastes delicious.

40:53.028 --> 40:54.862
I think it says a lot
about you as a cook

40:54.897 --> 40:56.930
and as a mature young man.

40:56.966 --> 40:57.931
Good job.

40:57.967 --> 40:58.977
I'm really proud of myself,

40:59.001 --> 41:01.535
because, out of
thousands of kids,

41:01.570 --> 41:03.837
<i>I made it into the top ten.</i>

41:03.873 --> 41:07.407
You totally took this 1980s dish

41:07.443 --> 41:11.779
and brought it into 2016
with such elegance.

41:11.814 --> 41:12.946
Thank you, chef.

41:12.982 --> 41:14.582
I'm going to have
so many great memories.

41:14.617 --> 41:16.083
<i>Here in the masterchef kitchen.</i>

41:16.118 --> 41:17.851
crack it, crack it!

41:17.887 --> 41:21.255
<i>I got dumped on by
a bunch of marshmallows.</i>

41:21.290 --> 41:24.324
<i>I got soaked by
a giant lemonade balloon.</i>

41:25.995 --> 41:29.630
But, best of all,
I've made some great friends.

41:29.665 --> 41:30.864
Blue team!

41:33.669 --> 41:35.469
<i>I have accomplished so much.</i>

41:37.206 --> 41:38.917
I won three challenges
in "masterchef junior."

41:38.941 --> 41:40.574
The dish of the night:
Kaitlyn.

41:40.609 --> 41:42.576
It was just magical.

41:42.611 --> 41:43.944
Kaitlyn, out of this world.

41:43.979 --> 41:46.446
Whoo, go, Kaitlyn!

41:46.482 --> 41:47.981
I'll miss you.

41:48.017 --> 41:50.717
<i>I may not have gotten
the masterchef trophy,</i>

41:50.753 --> 41:52.486
but I'm very proud
to be going back home

41:52.521 --> 41:54.221
with my masterchef apron.

41:54.256 --> 41:56.156
Come on, Kaitlyn, chin up high.

41:59.862 --> 42:01.128
<i>Still to come...</i>

42:01.163 --> 42:02.729
Switch!

42:02.765 --> 42:04.476
<i>It's a "masterchef
junior" classic.</i>

42:04.500 --> 42:05.911
It's the hardest
tag-team challenge

42:05.935 --> 42:08.502
that we've ever asked
any home cook to undertake.

42:08.537 --> 42:09.614
That's not good.

42:09.638 --> 42:11.038
Unbelievable.

42:11.073 --> 42:12.539
<i>The top eight pair up...</i>

42:12.575 --> 42:14.174
Whoa!

42:14.210 --> 42:16.443
<i>In the most intense
challenge of the season.</i>

42:16.478 --> 42:17.644
Time's running out!

42:17.680 --> 42:19.024
Put the food on the plate, kya!

42:19.048 --> 42:20.048
Two!

42:20.082 --> 42:21.715
The lamb is not cooked!

42:21.750 --> 42:23.417
- One!
- stop crying, Amaya.

42:23.452 --> 42:25.052
- I can't.
- Don't break down.

42:25.087 --> 42:26.709
I'm trying, I'm trying.

42:26.789 --> 42:28.856
This is not good.

42:43.734 --> 42:44.975
Come on down, guys.

42:45.055 --> 42:48.063
I can't believe
I'm in the top eight.

42:48.098 --> 42:49.475
Straight to
your stations, please.

42:49.499 --> 42:51.933
- Yes, chef.
<i>- I am so happy</i>

42:51.968 --> 42:54.335
<i>to still be
in the masterchef kitchen,</i>

42:54.371 --> 42:57.338
<i>since I almost went home
in the last challenge.</i>

42:57.374 --> 42:59.507
<i>If I want to open up my bakery,</i>

42:59.543 --> 43:02.444
I need to step up my game.

43:02.479 --> 43:03.878
Welcome back, guys.

43:03.914 --> 43:05.258
We started this competition

43:05.282 --> 43:07.415
by meeting thousands
of young home cooks

43:07.451 --> 43:08.917
across the country.

43:08.952 --> 43:13.722
And now we're down to you,
the top eight.

43:13.757 --> 43:18.093
Now, I've invited someone
special here today.

43:18.128 --> 43:22.097
She's my absolute best friend
in the entire world.

43:22.132 --> 43:23.932
I know who it is.

43:23.967 --> 43:25.600
All the way from Virginia...

43:28.071 --> 43:30.171
My mother, Greta.

43:32.442 --> 43:34.542
- Hello!
- hi!

43:34.578 --> 43:37.912
It's awesome to be meeting
Christina's mom.

43:37.948 --> 43:39.748
- Hi, mom.
- Sweetie.

43:39.783 --> 43:41.449
Love you.

43:41.485 --> 43:43.551
<i>Christina's the best
pastry chef in the world,</i>

43:43.587 --> 43:45.286
and her mom
is how it all started.

43:45.322 --> 43:46.855
I am so excited to be here.

43:46.890 --> 43:48.356
I'm so pleased to meet you.

43:48.391 --> 43:51.292
We asked Christina's
amazing mum, Greta,

43:51.328 --> 43:54.629
to put together
an amazing mystery box.

43:56.967 --> 43:59.768
On my mom's count of three,

43:59.803 --> 44:02.837
please lift your mystery boxes.

44:02.873 --> 44:03.972
One...

44:04.007 --> 44:05.907
two, three.

44:05.942 --> 44:06.908
Lift!

44:06.943 --> 44:09.144
Aah!

44:09.179 --> 44:10.145
Yes!

44:10.180 --> 44:11.646
In those mystery boxes,

44:11.681 --> 44:14.115
you'll find pretty much
every single thing

44:14.151 --> 44:16.184
that Christina
would eat as a child.

44:16.219 --> 44:19.621
We have chicken breasts,
chocolate chips,

44:19.656 --> 44:21.856
strawberries,
worcestershire sauce,

44:21.892 --> 44:24.425
broccoli, fruity rice cereal,

44:24.461 --> 44:26.127
chocolate rice cereal.

44:26.163 --> 44:27.996
What am I gonna do with cereal?

44:28.031 --> 44:30.498
And some worcestershire
and candy?

44:30.534 --> 44:32.066
I mean, seriously?

44:32.102 --> 44:34.836
<i>How are you supposed to make
a dish out of that stuff?</i>

44:34.871 --> 44:37.372
now, before
we begin our challenge,

44:37.407 --> 44:40.942
we have another surprise
for you.

44:40.977 --> 44:41.943
Another one?

44:41.978 --> 44:43.578
Since I have my bff

44:43.613 --> 44:44.913
here with me,

44:44.948 --> 44:46.948
we thought maybe all of you
could use

44:46.983 --> 44:48.917
a little extra support
from yours, too.

44:50.220 --> 44:53.555
Open up your drawers
and take out what's inside.

44:53.590 --> 44:55.890
It's a surface tablet.

44:55.926 --> 44:57.091
Oh, my gosh!

44:57.127 --> 44:58.893
And on those tablets,

44:58.929 --> 45:01.663
you're going to get to use Skype

45:01.698 --> 45:05.700
to have a video call
with your best friends.

45:05.735 --> 45:07.101
Yes!

45:07.137 --> 45:08.681
It's time to
turn on those tablets.

45:08.705 --> 45:10.605
Get a little extra boost
of support

45:10.640 --> 45:12.841
before you start
this mystery box.

45:12.876 --> 45:13.842
Hey, Greg-o!

45:13.877 --> 45:14.843
<i>Hi.</i>

45:14.878 --> 45:16.211
It's so awesome
to be here, Greg.

45:16.246 --> 45:17.579
- <i>You can do it.</i>
- Whoo!

45:17.614 --> 45:19.013
Do you know where I am?

45:19.049 --> 45:22.083
<i>Yeah, you're in the
masterchef junior kitchen!</i>

45:22.118 --> 45:23.084
Hi, shaheen.

45:23.119 --> 45:24.219
<i>Hey, Zac.</i>

45:24.254 --> 45:25.753
<i>to speak to my cousin shaheen,</i>

45:25.789 --> 45:26.988
it means so much to me,

45:27.023 --> 45:30.425
because she is extremely
supportive of my cooking.

45:30.460 --> 45:33.061
And do you see my apron?
Boom.

45:33.096 --> 45:35.096
- <i>You're so official.</i>
- I know, right?

45:35.131 --> 45:37.866
<i>Just really nice for her
to give me a couple of words</i>

45:37.901 --> 45:40.535
of encouragement
and really give me that boost

45:40.570 --> 45:42.937
that I need to win
"masterchef junior."

45:42.973 --> 45:44.906
More than half the kids
have gone,

45:44.941 --> 45:46.574
so I have a 1-in-8 chance
of winning.

45:46.610 --> 45:48.209
<i>You got this, man.</i>

45:48.245 --> 45:49.455
<i>And we miss you a lot back here,</i>

45:49.479 --> 45:51.512
<i>and we're super proud.</i>

45:51.548 --> 45:52.947
Last 30 seconds, guys.

45:52.983 --> 45:54.749
I have to say bye.

45:54.784 --> 45:55.950
<i>See you soon, bye.</i>

45:55.986 --> 45:58.553
- Bye.
- bye.

45:58.588 --> 46:00.588
So, now that you've all

46:00.624 --> 46:03.091
gotten a little inspiration
from your besties back home,

46:03.126 --> 46:05.326
it's time to get
this challenge started.

46:05.362 --> 46:07.262
And the winner of this challenge

46:07.297 --> 46:09.430
will get a huge advantage.

46:09.466 --> 46:10.431
Yes.

46:10.467 --> 46:12.233
You're gonna have 60 minutes

46:12.269 --> 46:14.213
to take some of Christina's
favorite childhood ingredients

46:14.237 --> 46:15.637
and make an amazing dish

46:15.672 --> 46:17.605
worthy of the biggest
cooking competition

46:17.641 --> 46:19.107
anywhere in the world.

46:19.142 --> 46:22.343
Your 60 minutes starts now.

46:25.015 --> 46:28.182
Get out of my way, fellas.
Ooh, wow, wow, wow.

46:29.653 --> 46:30.852
Oh, gosh.

46:30.887 --> 46:32.553
Ugh, this is heavy.

46:32.589 --> 46:34.956
This mystery box
challenge excites me to no end,

46:34.991 --> 46:36.369
because they're ingredients
that, for me,

46:36.393 --> 46:38.126
are right in my wheelhouse.

46:38.161 --> 46:39.827
Oh, my God, this is so heavy.

46:39.863 --> 46:41.007
When you're growing up

46:41.031 --> 46:42.864
and you're 6, 7, 8, 9 years old,

46:42.899 --> 46:44.465
this is food that's accessible

46:44.501 --> 46:46.868
and that's in the pantry of
your mother and father's house.

46:46.903 --> 46:48.503
And it's fun and colorful.

46:48.538 --> 46:51.105
Oh, this is even lighter
than my one at...

46:51.141 --> 46:52.907
where can these
kids go, Christina?

46:52.943 --> 46:54.553
I really think
that the home cooks

46:54.577 --> 46:55.688
should play to their strength,

46:55.712 --> 46:57.145
but also play
to their creativity,

46:57.180 --> 46:58.457
because we're not looking
for something

46:58.481 --> 47:00.415
pedestrian,
run-of-the-mill.

47:00.450 --> 47:02.917
That's for sure.

47:02.953 --> 47:04.218
Whoa.

47:04.254 --> 47:06.321
Gosh.

47:06.356 --> 47:08.656
Today I'm making
a chocolate molten lava cake

47:08.692 --> 47:11.592
with strawberry
and cereal sauce.

47:11.628 --> 47:13.761
I have won a lot of advantages,

47:13.797 --> 47:15.296
but I want to keep winning them

47:15.332 --> 47:18.533
to show other people
that I'm a really strong cook.

47:18.568 --> 47:20.101
Ooh, kya, looks delicious.

47:20.136 --> 47:21.302
Thank you.

47:21.338 --> 47:23.249
I'm making a simple soup
that I make with my dad.

47:23.273 --> 47:25.340
Broccoli, zucchini,
cheddar cheese soup.

47:25.375 --> 47:26.786
I feel like my dish
is gonna stand out,

47:26.810 --> 47:28.943
because most people
are making desserts,

47:28.979 --> 47:32.480
so I think this will really,
you know, wow the judges.

47:32.515 --> 47:34.782
30 minutes remaining.

47:38.421 --> 47:41.990
Sam the man, what's the dish?

47:42.025 --> 47:44.392
It's a chocolate mousse
with a little bit of mint

47:44.427 --> 47:46.394
and a strawberry sauce.

47:46.429 --> 47:48.629
Are you getting more confident
with these sweet things?

47:48.665 --> 47:49.697
I think so.

47:49.733 --> 47:52.667
At first, I was
really scared of Christina,

47:52.702 --> 47:55.536
but now that I know
that she likes my desserts...

47:55.572 --> 47:56.637
Mm-hmm?

47:56.673 --> 47:58.406
I'm feeling
a lot more confident.

47:58.441 --> 48:02.704
- Good. Good luck.
- Thank you, chef.

48:02.740 --> 48:04.006
That's perfect.

48:04.041 --> 48:05.674
- All right, Addison.
- Yes.

48:05.709 --> 48:06.853
What are you making today?

48:06.877 --> 48:09.845
Cocoa crispy rice cereal pie.

48:09.880 --> 48:12.280
Then, in the inside,
I'm gonna have pastry cream,

48:12.316 --> 48:13.915
strawberries, and chocolate.

48:13.951 --> 48:15.851
- Ooh.
- and if I have time,

48:15.886 --> 48:17.319
I'm gonna make some cereal milk.

48:17.354 --> 48:19.321
It sounds delicious, Addison.

48:19.356 --> 48:20.655
You know my mom's my bff.

48:20.691 --> 48:22.057
Mm-hmm.

48:22.092 --> 48:24.126
And we know that you got
to Skype with your bff.

48:24.161 --> 48:25.127
Mm-hmm.

48:25.162 --> 48:26.128
What kind of advice

48:26.163 --> 48:27.863
did your bff give you?

48:27.898 --> 48:31.633
She told me that I should bake,
and I said, "okay."

48:31.668 --> 48:33.702
wow, Addison, what would you do

48:33.737 --> 48:36.338
if you won $100,000?

48:36.373 --> 48:37.851
I would open up my own bakery

48:37.875 --> 48:39.307
called batter up bakery,

48:39.343 --> 48:41.176
and in the back I would have
a batting cage,

48:41.211 --> 48:42.744
that if you bought any food,

48:42.780 --> 48:44.713
you could use the batting cage
for free.

48:44.748 --> 48:46.581
I would come to batter up.

48:46.617 --> 48:48.094
- Good luck, Addison.
- Thank you, chef.

48:48.118 --> 48:49.551
Good luck, sweetheart.

48:49.586 --> 48:51.153
25 minutes to go, guys.

48:51.188 --> 48:53.722
Let's do it.

48:53.757 --> 48:55.924
- Avery, how we doing?
- I'm doing just fine, chef.

48:55.959 --> 48:56.925
Just fine?

48:56.960 --> 48:58.293
What is the dish?

48:58.328 --> 49:00.162
I'm making a strawberry pie.

49:00.197 --> 49:02.764
I'm basically going to make
a strawberry sauce too.

49:02.800 --> 49:05.434
I want to show you guys that
I'm not just a one-legged pony.

49:05.469 --> 49:06.435
I can do...

49:06.470 --> 49:07.436
One-legged pony?

49:07.471 --> 49:09.604
Is that the same
as a one-trick pony?

49:09.640 --> 49:10.739
Yes.

49:10.774 --> 49:11.740
All right, can't wait to try it.

49:11.775 --> 49:12.941
Good luck.

49:12.976 --> 49:14.342
Let that set.

49:14.378 --> 49:15.388
Zac, how you doing?

49:15.412 --> 49:16.378
I'm good, chef, how are you?

49:16.413 --> 49:17.579
I'm very good.

49:17.614 --> 49:18.958
Tell me about the dish,
what are you doing?

49:18.982 --> 49:20.393
I'm doing a pan-seared
chicken breast

49:20.417 --> 49:22.617
with broccoli,
crispy potato noodles

49:22.653 --> 49:24.152
and a potato puree.

49:24.188 --> 49:26.188
You've only been cooking
for just under two years.

49:26.223 --> 49:27.389
- Yes, chef.
- Yeah.

49:27.424 --> 49:28.535
Some of these kids in here
have been cooking

49:28.559 --> 49:30.192
since the age of 4 or 5.

49:30.227 --> 49:32.005
Do you see that as a bit
of a disadvantage or not?

49:32.029 --> 49:34.107
No, chef, I don't think
that's a disadvantage at all,

49:34.131 --> 49:36.031
because I am an amazing chef.

49:36.066 --> 49:37.977
Where does that level
of determination come from,

49:38.001 --> 49:39.401
to be successful?

49:39.436 --> 49:40.769
It comes from my dad and my mom,

49:40.804 --> 49:43.438
because they worked really hard
to get to where they are,

49:43.474 --> 49:45.073
and I want to be just like them.

49:45.109 --> 49:46.374
- Good luck.
- Thank you, chef.

49:46.410 --> 49:49.044
Just over ten minutes to go.

49:49.079 --> 49:50.779
What could I add
to make this better?

49:50.814 --> 49:52.380
And remember,

49:52.416 --> 49:58.019
there's a big key advantage
for the best dish of tonight.

49:58.055 --> 49:59.187
Dang it.

49:59.223 --> 50:00.555
My cereal, it's burnt.

50:00.591 --> 50:03.525
It's on, like, fire.

50:03.560 --> 50:04.693
Crap.

50:04.728 --> 50:06.915
Look at that.

50:06.951 --> 50:08.417
<i>My station is really smoky.</i>

50:08.452 --> 50:11.787
It's like smoke everywhere.
It's just black.

50:11.822 --> 50:12.788
What's going on back there?

50:12.823 --> 50:14.490
I mean, it looks
like smoke signals.

50:14.525 --> 50:16.592
<i>This is not looking good.</i>

50:16.627 --> 50:17.867
dang it, dang it, dang it.

50:22.538 --> 50:23.771
Dang it.

50:23.806 --> 50:24.772
It's burnt.

50:24.807 --> 50:26.440
It's on, like, fire.

50:29.278 --> 50:30.678
Dang it, dang it, dang it.

50:30.713 --> 50:31.845
Look at that.

50:31.881 --> 50:33.547
- Sam.
- what's going on back there?

50:33.582 --> 50:38.319
I mean, it looks
like smoke signals.

50:38.354 --> 50:40.187
- What is it, bud?
- My cereal burnt.

50:40.222 --> 50:42.256
Don't worry, don't worry,
let's get it out.

50:42.291 --> 50:44.625
Ooh, dear, Sam.

50:44.660 --> 50:46.260
That's definitely ready, wow.

50:46.295 --> 50:49.029
<i>I tried to broil my
cereal for two seconds,</i>

50:49.065 --> 50:50.197
and it went poof!

50:50.232 --> 50:51.198
Whew.

50:51.233 --> 50:52.533
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

50:52.568 --> 50:53.779
Do you have any more
cereal anywhere?

50:53.803 --> 50:54.768
Yes, chef.

50:54.804 --> 50:55.970
Let's get another tray in.

50:56.005 --> 50:57.516
Just shake the tray
so they toast evenly.

50:57.540 --> 50:58.906
<i>Time's almost up.</i>

50:58.941 --> 51:01.181
I got to keep moving and try
to make a new one right now.

51:01.210 --> 51:02.376
Good luck.

51:02.411 --> 51:03.588
3 1/2 minutes to go, guys.

51:03.612 --> 51:04.923
Let's go.
Think about that plating.

51:04.947 --> 51:06.947
- Oh, my gosh.
- Start plating.

51:06.983 --> 51:09.049
Sam nearly
burned the house down.

51:09.085 --> 51:12.419
He had some cereal in the oven,
and it got a little bit toasty.

51:13.456 --> 51:14.822
So who looks good?

51:14.857 --> 51:17.691
Zac is doing the most amazing
marinated chicken breast.

51:17.727 --> 51:19.527
Addison's
tart looks really great.

51:19.562 --> 51:21.261
If she gets that bake time
just right,

51:21.297 --> 51:23.130
will bring us to another world.

51:23.165 --> 51:25.699
Christina, cereal milk.

51:26.969 --> 51:29.636
30 seconds remaining.

51:29.672 --> 51:31.605
We want to see
something magical tonight

51:31.640 --> 51:33.974
from Christina's favorite
childhood ingredients.

51:34.010 --> 51:36.310
- That's perfect.
- Ten seconds to go.

51:36.345 --> 51:38.178
<i>My chicken is perfect.</i>

51:38.214 --> 51:41.415
seven, six, five...

51:41.450 --> 51:43.150
wow.

51:43.185 --> 51:46.653
Three, two, one.

51:46.689 --> 51:47.821
Hands up!

51:50.092 --> 51:52.026
Good job, everyone.

51:52.061 --> 51:54.395
Those dishes look amazing.

51:54.430 --> 51:56.830
And as always,
during those 60 minutes,

51:56.866 --> 52:00.467
we look, we taste, we smell,
we examine everything.

52:00.503 --> 52:03.871
Tonight my mom came
all the way from Virginia

52:03.906 --> 52:05.572
to bring you a box

52:05.608 --> 52:09.877
filled with my favorite
childhood comfort foods.

52:09.912 --> 52:14.048
It's time to bring forward
the best three dishes.

52:14.083 --> 52:16.750
The first dish we'd like
to take a closer look at

52:16.786 --> 52:19.319
is a dessert.

52:19.355 --> 52:22.222
It's a dessert that uses
strawberries,

52:22.258 --> 52:25.959
and it's plated beautifully.

52:25.995 --> 52:29.797
Please step forward, Addison.

52:29.832 --> 52:31.532
<i>Baking is my passion,</i>

52:31.567 --> 52:34.868
<i>and my last dessert
almost sent me home.</i>

52:34.904 --> 52:36.403
<i>I want to prove that I can bake.</i>

52:36.439 --> 52:41.108
So this is my
redemption dessert.

52:41.143 --> 52:43.710
Addison, what
have you made for us?

52:43.746 --> 52:47.381
Today I have made
a chocolate rice cereal

52:47.416 --> 52:49.249
and strawberry tart,

52:49.285 --> 52:51.018
and then some cereal milk.

52:51.053 --> 52:52.486
Presentation-wise,

52:52.521 --> 52:53.854
I like that it's a little funky.

52:53.889 --> 52:55.322
It's a little Jackson pollock

52:55.357 --> 52:57.291
with the chocolate
drippings there.

52:57.326 --> 52:58.292
What do you think, mom?

52:58.327 --> 52:59.560
I think it's amazing.

52:59.595 --> 53:01.495
I love the way she has
layered the strawberries.

53:01.530 --> 53:03.197
It's just lovely.

53:03.232 --> 53:06.567
Did you know you wanted
to go down the dessert route?

53:06.602 --> 53:07.846
I know that
the last dessert I made

53:07.870 --> 53:09.503
got me into the bottom three,

53:09.538 --> 53:12.172
and I was very close
to going home.

53:12.208 --> 53:15.075
And just like when I'm
in softball and I strike out,

53:15.111 --> 53:17.344
that doesn't mean the next time
I go up to the plate,

53:17.379 --> 53:20.981
I can't hit a home run.

53:21.016 --> 53:21.982
What do you think, mom?

53:22.017 --> 53:23.350
You're a chocolate fan.

53:23.385 --> 53:25.786
I really enjoy
the texture of it.

53:25.821 --> 53:27.354
I love the depth

53:27.389 --> 53:30.624
of the chocolate mousse
component of it.

53:30.659 --> 53:33.727
You're very smart
to do the cereal crust,

53:33.762 --> 53:34.895
and then to put that layer

53:34.930 --> 53:37.131
of chocolate fudge,
chocolate ganache there.

53:37.166 --> 53:38.910
I think that really
helped elevate that crust.

53:38.934 --> 53:40.200
Yes.

53:40.236 --> 53:41.613
The crust, I think,
probably could have been baked

53:41.637 --> 53:42.603
just a little bit longer.

53:42.638 --> 53:43.770
Longer, yes.

53:43.806 --> 53:44.872
Overall, the flavors

53:44.907 --> 53:46.573
of chocolate
to pastry cream to strawberry

53:46.609 --> 53:47.908
are really nice.

53:47.943 --> 53:50.878
And what the fruity cereal milk
brings to the dish,

53:50.913 --> 53:52.146
I think, is really great.

53:52.181 --> 53:53.347
- Nice job.
- Thank you, chef.

53:53.382 --> 53:54.648
Bravo.

53:58.053 --> 53:59.486
The second dish

53:59.522 --> 54:01.488
that we all want
to examine further

54:01.524 --> 54:04.091
shows a lot of creativity,

54:04.126 --> 54:05.325
as well as technique,

54:05.361 --> 54:08.228
and it's a savory dish.

54:08.264 --> 54:11.999
This dish belongs to...

54:12.034 --> 54:13.300
Zac.

54:13.335 --> 54:14.468
<i>Yes.</i>

54:14.503 --> 54:16.370
<i>I'm so happy I decided
to do something</i>

54:16.405 --> 54:20.374
different than everyone else
and go the savory route.

54:20.409 --> 54:21.742
The more risk, the more reward.

54:21.777 --> 54:24.578
<i>So I hope the judges love it.</i>

54:24.613 --> 54:27.414
So, Zac, what is
the description of the dish?

54:27.449 --> 54:30.450
It's a pan-seared chicken breast

54:30.486 --> 54:33.320
with a potato purée, broccoli,

54:33.355 --> 54:36.190
and crispy potato noodles.

54:36.225 --> 54:37.502
Greta, did you think a dish
like this

54:37.526 --> 54:39.204
was gonna come out of
that mystery box you chose?

54:39.228 --> 54:40.928
No way.

54:40.963 --> 54:42.796
Absolutely amazing.

54:42.831 --> 54:46.200
So, Zac, when you
lifted that mystery box up,

54:46.235 --> 54:47.901
what did you think
of those ingredients?

54:47.937 --> 54:49.803
I obviously knew that
there was gonna be

54:49.838 --> 54:51.572
some sweet ingredients,

54:51.607 --> 54:53.807
and I thought that
a lot of people would do that,

54:53.842 --> 54:55.876
so that's why I went
the opposite direction

54:55.911 --> 54:59.746
and I made the savory dish.

55:03.852 --> 55:06.253
You've got your vegetable,
you've got crunch, texture,

55:06.288 --> 55:07.588
beautiful cook on the chicken.

55:07.623 --> 55:09.590
Everything on here
is super simple.

55:09.625 --> 55:10.991
It looks like three ingredients.

55:11.026 --> 55:12.526
They're all done perfectly.

55:12.561 --> 55:15.062
And it shows
not only the skill that you have

55:15.097 --> 55:17.264
in cooking a technical dish,

55:17.299 --> 55:19.967
but that you're very methodical
in your thought process

55:20.002 --> 55:23.036
to get from a to z,
and you did it great.

55:23.072 --> 55:24.171
Thank you, chef.

55:25.708 --> 55:27.007
- Great job, Zac.
- Thanks.

55:27.042 --> 55:28.208
High five.

55:28.244 --> 55:29.676
The third and final dish

55:29.712 --> 55:31.278
we would like to examine
more closely...

55:31.313 --> 55:33.013
This is a bit
of a mystery for us,

55:33.048 --> 55:37.784
because it is a dish
that doesn't look that good,

55:37.820 --> 55:42.422
but the main element of
this dish tastes phenomenal.

55:42.458 --> 55:47.127
Please bring that dessert
down here, Sam.

55:47.162 --> 55:48.328
<i>This is awesome.</i>

55:48.364 --> 55:49.541
I've never been in the top three

55:49.565 --> 55:51.042
with the mystery box challenge
before.

55:51.066 --> 55:53.233
<i>And it was after
I almost burnt down</i>

55:53.269 --> 55:54.968
<i>the masterchef kitchen.</i>

55:55.004 --> 55:57.271
Sam, describe the dish, please.

55:57.306 --> 55:58.905
It's a chocolate mousse

55:58.941 --> 56:02.242
with a strawberry mint
maple syrup coulis

56:02.278 --> 56:04.945
and a strawberry sauce.

56:04.980 --> 56:07.047
What'd you do
with the strawberries?

56:07.082 --> 56:09.027
I put them in a pot
with a little bit of water

56:09.051 --> 56:11.018
and maple syrup
until they got soft,

56:11.053 --> 56:12.786
and I mashed them.

56:19.695 --> 56:20.695
How does that taste?

56:20.729 --> 56:22.629
Really good.

56:22.665 --> 56:23.708
And how does that look?

56:23.732 --> 56:25.032
A mess.

56:25.067 --> 56:28.068
You did the most
important part brilliantly.

56:28.103 --> 56:31.271
You made an incredible mousse.

56:31.307 --> 56:33.573
Well done.
Thank you, Sam.

56:33.609 --> 56:35.642
- Nice job, Sam.
- Great job.

56:35.678 --> 56:37.778
I thought I wouldn't
even be up there.

56:37.813 --> 56:40.247
- Three incredible dishes.
- Oh, incredible.

56:40.282 --> 56:41.848
I have to win this.

56:41.884 --> 56:44.017
I've only been in the top once.

56:44.053 --> 56:46.420
Two amazing desserts,
one incredible savory.

56:46.455 --> 56:48.422
<i>I know that my
dish was really good,</i>

56:48.457 --> 56:51.224
<i>but Addison had
this amazing tart,</i>

56:51.260 --> 56:55.395
<i>and then Sam, his mousse
was not really the prettiest,</i>

56:55.431 --> 56:57.331
<i>but it tastes delicious.</i>

56:57.366 --> 57:00.467
three amazing dishes.

57:00.502 --> 57:04.871
All three took me back to some
great childhood memories.

57:04.907 --> 57:08.275
But there can only be
one winner tonight.

57:08.310 --> 57:11.578
The young cook
with the dish of the night...

57:11.613 --> 57:13.513
Congratulations...

57:19.973 --> 57:24.976
The young cook
with the dish of the night...

57:25.011 --> 57:29.547
Congratulations...

57:29.583 --> 57:30.682
Zac.

57:30.717 --> 57:32.917
Oh, yes.

57:32.953 --> 57:34.452
Oh, my God.

57:34.488 --> 57:35.587
Yes!

57:35.622 --> 57:38.857
I finally won
a mystery box challenge.

57:38.892 --> 57:40.291
Oh, my...

57:40.327 --> 57:42.560
<i>Christina's mom being here
was so lucky for me.</i>

57:42.596 --> 57:43.561
Nice job.

57:43.597 --> 57:44.841
Congrats, Zac, good job.

57:44.865 --> 57:46.064
Nice job, Addison.

57:46.099 --> 57:47.465
<i>I'm stoked.</i>

57:47.501 --> 57:48.633
And I can't wait to find out

57:48.668 --> 57:50.702
what this big advantage
is gonna be.

57:52.372 --> 57:55.640
Zac, before we find out
your huge advantage,

57:55.675 --> 57:57.442
I just want to thank my mom

57:57.477 --> 58:00.712
for coming here
all the way from Virginia.

58:00.747 --> 58:01.747
Thank you.

58:02.983 --> 58:07.385
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

58:07.421 --> 58:08.553
Bye, sweetie, good-bye.

58:08.588 --> 58:09.654
Good luck.

58:09.689 --> 58:10.955
Wow, what a lady.

58:10.991 --> 58:12.957
Absolutely incredible.

58:12.993 --> 58:15.460
Thank you.

58:15.495 --> 58:17.762
Can all of you
come down into the front?

58:17.798 --> 58:22.000
Zac, please come and stand
over here.

58:22.035 --> 58:24.502
Zac's advantage tonight is big,

58:24.538 --> 58:26.704
and the next challenge
is gonna be epic.

58:26.740 --> 58:27.972
Ooh.

58:28.008 --> 58:31.643
This next challenge
is a team challenge.

58:31.678 --> 58:33.411
You guys are gonna
face this challenge

58:33.447 --> 58:35.513
in four teams of two.

58:35.549 --> 58:37.849
Oh.

58:37.884 --> 58:41.085
Zac, who do you think is gonna
be picking all four teams?

58:43.657 --> 58:44.789
Me?

58:44.825 --> 58:45.857
That's right.

58:45.892 --> 58:47.759
You are, Zac.

58:47.794 --> 58:49.260
<i>I am super excited,</i>

58:49.296 --> 58:51.830
but then, at the same time,
I feel really, really nervous,

58:51.865 --> 58:54.466
because I have to pick
all of these teams,

58:54.501 --> 58:58.036
<i>and everyone here, they're all
really good friends of mine,</i>

58:58.071 --> 58:59.938
<i>but then, this is a competition.</i>

58:59.973 --> 59:03.775
Zac, first, you need
to pick your own teammate.

59:03.810 --> 59:06.211
I'm choosing this person
because I know

59:06.246 --> 59:10.415
that she is an amazing chef,

59:10.450 --> 59:13.718
and I think that we'll work
extremely well together,

59:13.753 --> 59:16.020
so I choose kya.

59:16.056 --> 59:18.256
Kya, come up and stand

59:18.291 --> 59:20.592
on the other side of Zac,
please, my darling.

59:20.627 --> 59:22.060
Got this, kya, right?

59:22.095 --> 59:27.232
Now, who do you put with Sam?

59:27.267 --> 59:28.967
I'm choosing kamilly.

59:29.002 --> 59:32.337
<i>Communication is
key in team challenges,</i>

59:32.372 --> 59:34.839
so I'm putting Sam with kamilly

59:34.875 --> 59:37.842
<i>because they're both
extremely quiet,</i>

59:37.878 --> 59:40.578
and I think that there will be
some lack of communication.

59:40.614 --> 59:43.114
Let's go to Avery.

59:45.151 --> 59:46.651
I'm choosing jj.

59:46.686 --> 59:48.319
Jj, wow.

59:48.355 --> 59:51.456
Obviously the last pairing
is Amaya and Addison.

59:51.491 --> 59:54.158
Addison, she's a very good cook,

59:54.194 --> 59:57.729
but I can be super, mega bossy.

59:57.764 --> 01:00:00.398
Zac and kya, stand next
to Addison and Amaya, please.

01:00:00.433 --> 01:00:03.468
<i>And Addison, as
well, can, like, be bossy.</i>

01:00:03.503 --> 01:00:05.169
I just think
that our personalities

01:00:05.205 --> 01:00:08.373
will clash a little bit.

01:00:08.408 --> 01:00:11.009
You have your teams, but...

01:00:11.044 --> 01:00:14.345
There is one more important fact
that you don't know yet.

01:00:14.381 --> 01:00:17.682
This isn't any ordinary
team challenge.

01:00:17.717 --> 01:00:21.286
This is a tag team challenge.

01:00:21.321 --> 01:00:24.956
- No!
- no!

01:00:24.991 --> 01:00:26.357
<i>I'm really scared,</i>

01:00:26.393 --> 01:00:29.160
because I've seen
the tag team challenge before,

01:00:29.195 --> 01:00:31.229
and they're extremely hard.

01:00:31.264 --> 01:00:32.264
We got this.

01:00:32.299 --> 01:00:33.631
<i>This is gonna be crazy.</i>

01:00:33.667 --> 01:00:35.144
are you guys ready to find out

01:00:35.168 --> 01:00:37.702
exactly what you are going
to be making as a tag team?

01:00:37.737 --> 01:00:40.138
Yes, chef!

01:00:40.173 --> 01:00:42.206
All three of
us are world travelers.

01:00:42.242 --> 01:00:46.044
Every culture, every country,
has its own food identity.

01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:48.112
To get a true taste
of any country,

01:00:48.148 --> 01:00:49.647
a real sense of its food,

01:00:49.683 --> 01:00:51.149
you have to walk the street.

01:00:51.184 --> 01:00:55.186
Tonight's challenge
is an incredible tray of...

01:00:57.557 --> 01:00:59.257
International street food.

01:00:59.292 --> 01:01:00.292
Awesome.

01:01:00.327 --> 01:01:01.826
Oh, yes, I love those.

01:01:01.861 --> 01:01:04.095
Here you have potato pea samosa

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:08.232
with coriander yogurt raita
from India.

01:01:08.268 --> 01:01:12.003
You have mozzarella arancini
with marinara from Italy.

01:01:12.038 --> 01:01:15.139
Shrimp spring rolls
with a soy dipping sauce

01:01:15.175 --> 01:01:17.208
from Vietnam.

01:01:17.243 --> 01:01:19.510
Beef bao buns
with cucumber pickles

01:01:19.546 --> 01:01:20.912
from China.

01:01:20.947 --> 01:01:24.782
And then, lamb kofta
with tzatziki from Greece.

01:01:24.818 --> 01:01:29.687
It's a trip around the world
through our taste buds.

01:01:29.723 --> 01:01:31.956
It's time to head
to your stations, let's go.

01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:33.832
<i>I have never
gone out of the country,</i>

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:36.527
<i>but I actually have tasted
every single dish</i>

01:01:36.563 --> 01:01:38.529
<i>that's on that platter.</i>

01:01:38.565 --> 01:01:41.466
Street food is by far
the best food.

01:01:41.501 --> 01:01:43.546
At your stations, you
have everything that you need

01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:47.138
to replicate that platter
of international street food.

01:01:47.173 --> 01:01:49.173
In a tag team challenge,

01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:51.409
only one of you
can cook at a time.

01:01:51.444 --> 01:01:52.777
When we call switch,

01:01:52.812 --> 01:01:55.480
you'll tag your partner,
and you'll switch places.

01:01:55.515 --> 01:01:57.115
To succeed in this challenge,

01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:59.317
you'll have to communicate,

01:01:59.352 --> 01:02:01.686
and you have to work
together as a team.

01:02:01.721 --> 01:02:04.722
Stakes could not be any higher,

01:02:04.758 --> 01:02:07.291
because at
the end of this challenge,

01:02:07.327 --> 01:02:09.761
both members of the losing team

01:02:09.796 --> 01:02:12.664
will be saying good-bye
tonight.

01:02:12.699 --> 01:02:18.002
Can the finisher
step to the end of the bench?

01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:19.537
Is everybody ready?

01:02:19.572 --> 01:02:22.507
Yes, chef!

01:02:22.542 --> 01:02:26.678
Your 60 minutes starts...

01:02:26.713 --> 01:02:28.279
Now.

01:02:28.314 --> 01:02:30.248
- Get that water boiling.
- You got this.

01:02:30.283 --> 01:02:31.594
On the other side,
on the other side,

01:02:31.618 --> 01:02:33.151
because the water's
closer to there.

01:02:33.186 --> 01:02:35.064
Get everything pre-heating,
and then start your chopping.

01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:36.521
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:02:36.556 --> 01:02:37.822
Start the marinara.

01:02:37.857 --> 01:02:39.817
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Getting the steamer.

01:02:40.627 --> 01:02:41.959
Aah.

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:45.063
Wow, so, difficult challenge,

01:02:45.098 --> 01:02:47.198
but the energy in this kitchen
tonight is incredible.

01:02:47.233 --> 01:02:48.444
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Listen to them.

01:02:48.468 --> 01:02:49.478
Pour the kettle right away.

01:02:49.502 --> 01:02:50.702
You can do it, you can do it.

01:02:50.737 --> 01:02:53.104
Squeeze like you've
never squeezed before!

01:02:53.139 --> 01:02:54.238
Great job, jj.

01:02:54.274 --> 01:02:56.207
What steps are you taking first?

01:02:56.242 --> 01:02:57.341
Marinara sauce.

01:02:57.377 --> 01:02:58.988
You want the depth
of the flavor to come through,

01:02:59.012 --> 01:03:00.211
so that's got to go on early.

01:03:00.246 --> 01:03:01.457
Let it just simmer.
Put it on the back burner.

01:03:01.481 --> 01:03:03.047
Don't even worry about it
till the end.

01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:04.560
After that, then you've
got to start the bao buns,

01:03:04.584 --> 01:03:07.085
but the secret behind these
is to marinate the flank steak.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.230
So the marinade is something

01:03:08.254 --> 01:03:10.021
that you need to have happen
quickly, right?

01:03:10.056 --> 01:03:11.422
Slice it nice and thinly,

01:03:11.458 --> 01:03:12.501
marinate as long as you can,

01:03:12.525 --> 01:03:14.559
grill it,
mix it with the pickles,

01:03:14.594 --> 01:03:16.094
and then put those buns
in a steamer.

01:03:16.129 --> 01:03:18.007
Steaming the
buns is an important part,

01:03:18.031 --> 01:03:19.542
but it's not something
you can do too early,

01:03:19.566 --> 01:03:23.067
because the second
those buns cool down, dry.

01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:26.104
Arancini, leftover Risotto,
balled up,

01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:28.239
a little touch
of mozzarella in the center,

01:03:28.274 --> 01:03:29.373
lightly bread-crumbed,

01:03:29.409 --> 01:03:30.908
and then shallot fries.

01:03:30.944 --> 01:03:32.221
- Right.
- come on, pile that in there.

01:03:32.245 --> 01:03:33.644
That samosa is
one of my favorites.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.013
Those potatoes cooked,
combined with peas.

01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:37.014
Drop the peas.

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:38.182
Put them into the water.

01:03:38.218 --> 01:03:39.762
Seasoned perfectly
before they're wrapped.

01:03:39.786 --> 01:03:41.597
You need a little bit more
seasoning, just so you know.

01:03:41.621 --> 01:03:43.788
After that, then you
start rolling the koftas.

01:03:43.823 --> 01:03:44.867
As things are being cooked,

01:03:44.891 --> 01:03:47.058
you start rolling
the spring rolls.

01:03:47.093 --> 01:03:48.693
Mix, mix, mix,
and then taste it.

01:03:48.728 --> 01:03:51.140
Where do you think
these home cooks could go wrong?

01:03:51.164 --> 01:03:52.575
The secret to
this tag team challenge

01:03:52.599 --> 01:03:53.631
is to divide and conquer,

01:03:53.666 --> 01:03:55.867
but make sure that you each

01:03:55.902 --> 01:03:57.735
check in with each other
every minute.

01:03:57.771 --> 01:03:59.470
What do you think I should
do next?

01:03:59.506 --> 01:04:01.606
Stuff the arancini with cheese,

01:04:01.641 --> 01:04:02.974
and then start
breading them, too.

01:04:03.009 --> 01:04:04.142
Too much, too much.

01:04:04.177 --> 01:04:05.221
We're asking them to achieve

01:04:05.245 --> 01:04:06.611
five dishes on one platter.

01:04:06.646 --> 01:04:07.957
You've got to be able
to multitask

01:04:07.981 --> 01:04:09.647
as well as communicate.

01:04:09.682 --> 01:04:11.082
Then start slicing the peppers,

01:04:11.117 --> 01:04:13.084
and then start
chopping the onion.

01:04:13.119 --> 01:04:16.020
Next I can do
the cucumber marinade.

01:04:16.055 --> 01:04:18.256
60 seconds to go
before we swap, guys.

01:04:18.291 --> 01:04:19.757
60 seconds to go?
What the...

01:04:19.793 --> 01:04:21.225
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:04:21.261 --> 01:04:22.226
Just add the whole thing.

01:04:22.262 --> 01:04:23.227
Stand by.

01:04:23.263 --> 01:04:24.473
Addie, don't forget to taste it.

01:04:24.497 --> 01:04:25.997
Okay, okay.

01:04:26.032 --> 01:04:27.832
- Three, two, one.
- That's good, that's good.

01:04:27.867 --> 01:04:29.066
Switch!

01:04:29.102 --> 01:04:30.746
- The bao buns are not done.
- Yeah, they are.

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:31.947
- They're overdone.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

01:04:31.971 --> 01:04:32.971
Get the pickles in!

01:04:33.006 --> 01:04:34.305
Get the pickles in, go, Amaya!

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.773
Guys, speed up, let's go,
come on.

01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:36.941
Got to communicate.

01:04:36.976 --> 01:04:38.320
You can do it,
Avery, just hurry.

01:04:38.344 --> 01:04:39.922
- Right, how's it going?
- Taste the pickle.

01:04:39.946 --> 01:04:41.056
It's going really good, chef.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.080
Is the steak in marinade?

01:04:42.115 --> 01:04:43.981
No, chef, it's about to be.

01:04:44.017 --> 01:04:45.294
Right, what did you do
in the first ten minutes?

01:04:45.318 --> 01:04:46.651
What did you accomplish?

01:04:46.686 --> 01:04:48.519
I have started the peas
and the potatoes,

01:04:48.555 --> 01:04:51.055
and then I marinated
the cucumber slices.

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:53.424
Why marinade the cucumber
before the steak?

01:04:53.459 --> 01:04:56.127
Because we know that
cucumbers take a while...

01:04:56.162 --> 01:04:58.329
No, no, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:04:58.364 --> 01:05:01.833
Come on,
now you're sounding silly.

01:05:01.868 --> 01:05:03.234
- Yes, chef.
- Come on.

01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:04.680
What's more important,
the steak or the cucumbers?

01:05:04.704 --> 01:05:05.670
Steak, chef.

01:05:05.705 --> 01:05:06.804
- Avery.
- yes, chef?

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.239
- Psst, hello?
- Yes, chef?

01:05:08.274 --> 01:05:10.842
Set the alarm clock
and wake up a little bit.

01:05:10.877 --> 01:05:13.644
Gordon ramsay
does not look happy,

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.613
and this is not good.

01:05:15.648 --> 01:05:17.081
Come on, you two.

01:05:17.116 --> 01:05:18.916
Not good enough.

01:05:18.952 --> 01:05:20.751
This is not looking good
for me and jj.

01:05:20.787 --> 01:05:22.453
I'm going as fast as I can.

01:05:27.258 --> 01:05:29.558
Why marinade the cucumber
before the steak?

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:32.561
Because we know that
cucumbers take a while...

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:34.463
No, no, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:05:34.498 --> 01:05:36.598
Come on,
now you're sounding silly.

01:05:36.634 --> 01:05:38.200
- Okay, yes, chef.
- Come on.

01:05:38.235 --> 01:05:39.635
What's the hero on that bun?

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:40.636
It's the steak.

01:05:40.671 --> 01:05:41.637
And where are you from?

01:05:41.672 --> 01:05:42.705
I'm from Texas.

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.251
Have you turned into
all vegetarian on me?

01:05:44.275 --> 01:05:46.442
- No, chef.
- Come on, you two.

01:05:46.477 --> 01:05:47.910
Not good enough.

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:49.678
<i>Jj and I are both hunters,</i>

01:05:49.714 --> 01:05:52.681
so we're like the meat people
out of everybody.

01:05:52.717 --> 01:05:54.917
<i>We need to get on the ball.</i>

01:05:54.952 --> 01:05:56.730
Put it all in a bowl
and get it in the marinade.

01:05:56.754 --> 01:05:58.120
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

01:05:58.155 --> 01:05:59.388
- Hurry.
- shoot.

01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:01.023
- Take out the potatoes.
- Okay, hold on.

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:02.658
Lime and lemon juice, okay?

01:06:02.693 --> 01:06:04.004
All right,
how's the communication going?

01:06:04.028 --> 01:06:05.494
It's actually going amazing.

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:06.769
How far along are we right now?

01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:08.097
I just cut up all the vegetables

01:06:08.132 --> 01:06:10.432
for the spring rolls,
and she's gonna roll them.

01:06:10.468 --> 01:06:12.401
The tomato sauce
is just boiling away,

01:06:12.436 --> 01:06:13.936
and the steak
is marinating already.

01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:14.971
- It is, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:16.049
So do you want me to chop it?

01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:17.372
Yeah, into, like, small cubes.

01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:18.640
Okay.

01:06:18.676 --> 01:06:20.087
I mean, it looks
like you're focused.

01:06:20.111 --> 01:06:21.188
We're helping each other,
and we're figuring out

01:06:21.212 --> 01:06:22.277
what we're gonna do next.

01:06:22.313 --> 01:06:23.423
Totally, yeah, beautiful,
good job.

01:06:23.447 --> 01:06:24.413
Thanks, chef.

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:25.547
Keep going, keep going.

01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:27.416
30 seconds until we switch.

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:29.362
Start the Risotto ball
right now, okay, and then lamb.

01:06:29.386 --> 01:06:30.986
We've got to get
the samosas filled.

01:06:31.021 --> 01:06:33.122
Quicker, move faster!

01:06:33.157 --> 01:06:34.123
All right, guys, here we go.

01:06:34.158 --> 01:06:36.725
Three, two, one, switch!

01:06:36.761 --> 01:06:38.393
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:39.394
Check it.

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:40.763
Oh, Amaya!

01:06:40.798 --> 01:06:43.198
Come on, you got
to start frying food!

01:06:43.234 --> 01:06:44.566
Let's go!

01:06:44.602 --> 01:06:46.201
All right, Amaya.

01:06:46.237 --> 01:06:47.636
I see those steamed buns

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:48.849
look like they've
already been steamed.

01:06:48.873 --> 01:06:49.838
What's going on there?

01:06:49.874 --> 01:06:50.874
They've got to be steamed

01:06:50.908 --> 01:06:52.085
right before
they go on the platter,

01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:55.310
and you still have
some serious time left.

01:06:55.346 --> 01:06:57.357
There are a lot of other things
that maybe you need to think

01:06:57.381 --> 01:06:59.548
about prioritizing
that can be done right now

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:00.749
that are serco.

01:07:00.785 --> 01:07:02.217
That spring roll is served cold.

01:07:02.253 --> 01:07:03.886
A lot of the sauces
should be on.

01:07:03.921 --> 01:07:08.123
They're gonna need time as well.

01:07:08.159 --> 01:07:10.125
Amaya, Addison needs
to hear your voice.

01:07:10.161 --> 01:07:12.027
You need to be
communicating this stuff.

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:13.062
You can't be quiet.

01:07:13.097 --> 01:07:14.062
You don't want to go home.

01:07:14.098 --> 01:07:15.063
Yes, chef!

01:07:15.099 --> 01:07:16.231
Good luck.
Keep talking.

01:07:16.267 --> 01:07:18.333
Addie, please start
making the spring rolls.

01:07:18.369 --> 01:07:20.169
Well, not this second, Amaya.

01:07:20.204 --> 01:07:22.638
We have to make the spring rolls
sooner or later,

01:07:22.673 --> 01:07:24.540
and I prefer sooner.

01:07:24.575 --> 01:07:26.153
All right, that's good,
that's good, that's good!

01:07:26.177 --> 01:07:27.709
Start the samosas.

01:07:27.745 --> 01:07:28.822
- Sam, how are we doing?
- Hurry.

01:07:28.846 --> 01:07:30.056
Oh, we're doing good, chef.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.046
Who's doing what?

01:07:31.081 --> 01:07:32.125
Kamilly's doing the samosas,

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:33.215
and then once she's done,

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.594
I'm gonna run in
for the spring rolls.

01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:36.163
Okay, so you're just
taking one thing at a time,

01:07:36.187 --> 01:07:38.487
and completing it,
starting it, and finishing it?

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:39.655
- Yes, chef.
- Yes, chef.

01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:41.134
Is the tomatoes on
for the marinade sauce?

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:42.124
No.

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:43.125
Is the pickle on
for the bao buns?

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.126
- No.
- no, chef.

01:07:44.161 --> 01:07:46.695
Is the skirt steak marinated?

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:47.696
- No, chef.
- No.

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:48.842
- That's not on either?
- No.

01:07:48.866 --> 01:07:51.066
Guys, come on,
check in with each other.

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:53.135
It's like two individuals.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:54.670
You're on the same team.

01:07:54.705 --> 01:07:57.306
Listen, we may be behind,
but we're not gonna give up.

01:07:57.341 --> 01:07:58.574
Yes, chef.

01:07:58.609 --> 01:08:01.109
But you two have to
get on the same page, okay?

01:08:01.145 --> 01:08:02.344
Come on.

01:08:02.379 --> 01:08:03.590
So we got to get
the marinara sauce.

01:08:03.614 --> 01:08:04.614
Okay, get a pot.

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:05.826
Mash, mash, mash, smash it!

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:07.850
90 seconds to go
till the next switch.

01:08:07.885 --> 01:08:10.285
Just over 30 minutes to go.

01:08:10.321 --> 01:08:11.286
Communicate.

01:08:11.322 --> 01:08:12.688
The arancini, the arancini.

01:08:12.723 --> 01:08:13.834
Amaya, the samosas,

01:08:13.858 --> 01:08:14.957
they're stuck together.

01:08:14.992 --> 01:08:16.725
- Oh, gosh.
- Big problem.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.160
I'm gonna separate the samosas.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:20.140
You make the arancini
and the spring rolls, please.

01:08:20.163 --> 01:08:22.064
Cut and cut and cut, good.

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:23.777
Will you get
some water set for me?

01:08:23.801 --> 01:08:25.767
You're doing great.
You're working clean, dude.

01:08:25.803 --> 01:08:29.671
Three, two, one, switch!

01:08:29.707 --> 01:08:30.707
Go, go, go, go!

01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:32.207
Do the mozzarella balls!

01:08:32.243 --> 01:08:33.542
Sorry.

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:35.310
You can do it, okay?

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:38.145
I can hear, just so you know.

01:08:38.182 --> 01:08:39.915
Why don't you start
with the samosas?

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:41.183
Not too much garlic.

01:08:41.218 --> 01:08:42.529
Trust me, I know Asian cuisine.

01:08:42.553 --> 01:08:45.921
You use a lot of garlic.

01:08:45.956 --> 01:08:47.288
Wow, I am so nervous.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:49.691
Kamilly and Sam, they haven't
even marinated the steak.

01:08:49.727 --> 01:08:51.337
They've got no timers on
for the marinara sauce.

01:08:51.362 --> 01:08:53.127
What they've done
is dissected the board,

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.563
"you take three, I'll take two,"

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:57.366
and they're focused
individually, not as a team.

01:08:57.401 --> 01:08:58.367
Just get those out.

01:08:58.402 --> 01:08:59.835
You're doing really,
really good.

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:00.870
On the flipside,

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:03.071
Zac and kya
are gelling really well.

01:09:03.107 --> 01:09:04.339
They've got every sauce done.

01:09:04.375 --> 01:09:06.375
Everything's marinating,
everything's rolled.

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:08.510
That's way too
much filling, Amaya.

01:09:08.545 --> 01:09:10.212
That is enough filling.

01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:12.514
- It's way too much.
- It's enough!

01:09:12.549 --> 01:09:15.017
I'll tell you who I'm
surprised and worried about,

01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:16.818
is Amaya and Addison.

01:09:16.854 --> 01:09:18.398
Yeah, they're
not working together.

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:19.854
I don't think
they're compatible.

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:21.590
Oh, my gosh, Amaya.

01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:23.191
I'm getting this done.

01:09:23.227 --> 01:09:27.029
Stuffing arancini with cheese
is not easy.

01:09:27.064 --> 01:09:28.207
Coaches, I want to hear you.
Let's go.

01:09:28.232 --> 01:09:31.033
One minute to
go before we switch.

01:09:31.068 --> 01:09:32.434
You have a lot to do.

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:34.903
But I assure you,
we will get it done.

01:09:34.939 --> 01:09:36.004
Come on!

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.073
I'm trying as much as I can.

01:09:38.108 --> 01:09:39.374
That's not good.

01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:40.886
I don't do this every day
for a living, you know.

01:09:40.911 --> 01:09:43.245
Oh, no, I forgot to
put the bread and the flower

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.246
in the arancini.

01:09:44.281 --> 01:09:46.715
Get them out.

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:47.983
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:49.384
Start it over, hurry!

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:50.519
Five, four...

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:52.020
- Oh, my God.
- Three...

01:09:52.055 --> 01:09:53.055
Amaya, it's fine.

01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:54.156
No, they stuck together.

01:09:54.191 --> 01:09:55.857
One, switch!

01:09:55.893 --> 01:09:56.893
Pepper.

01:09:56.927 --> 01:09:57.893
Make the spring rolls!

01:09:57.928 --> 01:09:59.494
Hurry, please!

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:01.096
Start frying the balls.

01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:02.664
Get those lamb kebabs started.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.433
That's our first priority.

01:10:04.468 --> 01:10:07.469
- Stop crying, Amaya.
- I can't.

01:10:07.504 --> 01:10:08.904
They're yelling.

01:10:08.939 --> 01:10:11.306
S.o.s. coming from
Amaya and Addison's station.

01:10:11.342 --> 01:10:13.642
- Don't break down.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:14.910
We got this.

01:10:14.945 --> 01:10:16.705
We got this, Amaya,
we got this, we got this.

01:10:17.748 --> 01:10:19.982
The lamb is not cooked!

01:10:20.017 --> 01:10:21.183
I know!

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:23.218
The judges can't eat raw meat!

01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:25.487
Oh, we forgot to
dredge them in flour.

01:10:25.522 --> 01:10:27.133
Okay, just take them out,
just take them out.

01:10:27.157 --> 01:10:29.524
- Shoot.
- dress them in flour right now.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.792
I can't now.

01:10:30.828 --> 01:10:33.628
90 seconds to go
till your final switch.

01:10:33.664 --> 01:10:34.830
Speed up!

01:10:34.865 --> 01:10:36.331
We can do this, Addison.

01:10:36.367 --> 01:10:37.833
I have faith in us.

01:10:37.868 --> 01:10:39.334
Come on, faster.

01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:41.136
People are going home today.

01:10:41.171 --> 01:10:42.938
This is not for reward.

01:10:42.973 --> 01:10:44.439
You got to grab
the entire chunk.

01:10:44.475 --> 01:10:45.774
It's not even done.

01:10:45.809 --> 01:10:49.077
Three, two, one, switch!

01:10:49.113 --> 01:10:50.212
Let's go!

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:51.613
- Come on.
- Go, go, go.

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:52.681
- Hurry!
- go, go, go!

01:10:52.716 --> 01:10:54.182
Cook, Amaya, cook!

01:10:54.218 --> 01:10:56.752
Final switch, guys, come on!

01:10:56.787 --> 01:10:58.520
- Whoa.
- Amaya.

01:10:58.555 --> 01:11:00.322
last ten minutes, let's go.

01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:02.591
Make into like
little corn doggy shapes.

01:11:02.626 --> 01:11:03.903
Come on, kya,
you've got to hurry.

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:05.460
Almost done, still got to fry.

01:11:05.496 --> 01:11:07.340
So this is where
the intensity goes up.

01:11:07.364 --> 01:11:08.530
- Double.
- they speed up,

01:11:08.565 --> 01:11:10.065
but the level of communication

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.277
has to be so much more apparent.

01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:12.479
- Absolutely.
- no, you need water!

01:11:12.503 --> 01:11:13.969
It's okay!

01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:15.715
This is where
the teams start to unravel.

01:11:15.739 --> 01:11:17.339
It's about endurance as well.

01:11:17.374 --> 01:11:18.340
I can do it.

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:19.474
Don't worry, okay, okay?

01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:20.876
This is so stressful now.

01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:22.889
How much are you actually
expecting them to get on, guys?

01:11:22.913 --> 01:11:24.079
At least three.

01:11:24.114 --> 01:11:25.213
You can do it, Avery.

01:11:25.249 --> 01:11:26.214
I believe in you.

01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:27.394
Even though I'm running around

01:11:27.418 --> 01:11:29.751
like a chicken
with my head cut off.

01:11:29.787 --> 01:11:31.319
Last three minutes, come on.

01:11:31.355 --> 01:11:32.721
Oh, my God, our meat.

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:34.222
Man, we have so much to do.

01:11:34.258 --> 01:11:35.857
How are we gonna
get this on the plate?

01:11:35.893 --> 01:11:37.192
- Come on, guys.
- Oh, gosh.

01:11:37.227 --> 01:11:38.794
Start plating.

01:11:38.829 --> 01:11:39.995
Dig deep, guys.

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:41.430
- Okay.
- let's go.

01:11:41.465 --> 01:11:43.009
No, no, no,
no, they're still pink!

01:11:43.033 --> 01:11:44.166
They're still pink!

01:11:44.201 --> 01:11:45.567
I can't cook them any longer.

01:11:45.602 --> 01:11:46.568
Oh, my God.

01:11:46.603 --> 01:11:47.836
Whoo, come on, guys!

01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:49.838
Good job, Avery, good job.

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:51.540
Go, Amaya, go, Amaya,
we got this.

01:11:51.575 --> 01:11:54.342
Yes, we do, my friend, we do!

01:11:54.378 --> 01:11:55.744
Plate!

01:11:55.779 --> 01:11:57.245
I'm getting everything
that I got!

01:11:57.281 --> 01:11:58.458
- What's this for?
- I don't know.

01:11:58.482 --> 01:11:59.948
Just put the food
on the plate, kya!

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:00.949
Come on, guys.

01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:02.217
Time's running out!

01:12:02.252 --> 01:12:03.819
Come on, Sam, that's good.

01:12:03.854 --> 01:12:05.520
Come on, go, go, go, go.

01:12:05.556 --> 01:12:08.056
- Let's go.
- 60 seconds to go, guys.

01:12:09.526 --> 01:12:10.537
Come on, let's go.

01:12:10.561 --> 01:12:11.638
Great job, go, Amaya.

01:12:11.662 --> 01:12:12.861
Samosas are good.

01:12:12.896 --> 01:12:15.764
- Put them on the plate.
- What else do we have?

01:12:15.799 --> 01:12:17.466
Ten, nine...

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:18.867
Come on.

01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:20.535
Eight, seven, six...

01:12:20.571 --> 01:12:21.536
Kya!

01:12:21.572 --> 01:12:22.904
Five, four...

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:23.905
Right there, Amaya.

01:12:23.941 --> 01:12:25.340
Three, two, one,

01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:26.341
and stop!

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:27.976
- Time up!
- That's it.

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:30.879
Hands in the air, whoo!

01:12:33.372 --> 01:12:36.140
- Come on, guys.
- Kya!

01:12:36.175 --> 01:12:39.877
- Right there, Amaya.
- Five, four, three, two, one.

01:12:39.912 --> 01:12:40.878
And stop!

01:12:40.913 --> 01:12:42.079
- Time up.
- That's it.

01:12:42.114 --> 01:12:44.915
Hands in the air, whoo!

01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:47.384
- Well done.
- Good job, guys.

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.119
Don't cry.

01:12:49.155 --> 01:12:50.532
Okay, now for
the most important part,

01:12:50.556 --> 01:12:52.956
the taste.

01:12:52.992 --> 01:12:56.226
Let's start with...

01:12:56.262 --> 01:12:57.594
Amaya and Addison.

01:12:57.630 --> 01:12:59.096
I'll go.
Let it go, just me.

01:12:59.131 --> 01:13:00.931
<i>Communication was key today,</i>

01:13:00.966 --> 01:13:04.101
and Amaya and I had
some communication issues.

01:13:04.136 --> 01:13:09.239
<i>But even though we had a long
and emotional challenge today,</i>

01:13:09.275 --> 01:13:12.142
I think that we did
an awesome job together.

01:13:12.178 --> 01:13:13.877
Addison and Amaya,

01:13:13.913 --> 01:13:15.524
in terms of the breakdown
in communication,

01:13:15.548 --> 01:13:16.947
what happened?

01:13:16.982 --> 01:13:18.226
I don't know
what happened today.

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:19.628
I always keep my confidence,

01:13:19.652 --> 01:13:22.119
and I never have that type
of nervous breakdown.

01:13:22.154 --> 01:13:23.198
Yeah, I was stressed

01:13:23.222 --> 01:13:26.790
because I just wanted
to stay here so bad.

01:13:26.826 --> 01:13:28.425
I just think that I've never had

01:13:28.461 --> 01:13:29.927
as much pressure
as this has been.

01:13:29.962 --> 01:13:32.696
Well, pressure is healthy.

01:13:32.731 --> 01:13:34.198
I don't like seeing
you guys upset.

01:13:34.233 --> 01:13:37.134
And sometimes the emotions
get a little bit high.

01:13:37.169 --> 01:13:39.203
But sometimes where we feel

01:13:39.238 --> 01:13:41.371
we're our weakest
and most vulnerable,

01:13:41.407 --> 01:13:43.674
that's when you find
your strongest parts.

01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:45.442
And that's what you both did.

01:13:45.478 --> 01:13:48.178
Congratulations on getting
everything on the platter.

01:13:48.214 --> 01:13:49.480
What an effort.

01:13:49.515 --> 01:13:51.415
Okay, who grilled the lamb?

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:52.483
I did.

01:13:52.518 --> 01:13:56.186
Visually, it looks appetizing.

01:13:56.222 --> 01:13:57.754
Mm, beautiful sear.

01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:00.958
The seasoning is there,
and it tastes nice.

01:14:00.993 --> 01:14:02.493
Who cooked the samosa?

01:14:02.528 --> 01:14:03.528
Me, chef.

01:14:03.562 --> 01:14:06.763
It's just peas,
coriander, cumin.

01:14:06.799 --> 01:14:08.232
Yeah, spot on.

01:14:08.267 --> 01:14:09.399
Good job.

01:14:09.435 --> 01:14:10.667
Who rolled the arancini?

01:14:10.703 --> 01:14:11.668
I did.

01:14:11.704 --> 01:14:13.237
Some parts were cooking
unevenly,

01:14:13.272 --> 01:14:14.738
so I'm so sorry about that.

01:14:14.773 --> 01:14:15.813
Nice color, crisp.

01:14:15.841 --> 01:14:19.843
You got the balance right,
delicious.

01:14:19.879 --> 01:14:20.911
Beef's nice.

01:14:20.946 --> 01:14:22.145
I like the seasoning there.

01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:23.547
Remember one thing.

01:14:23.582 --> 01:14:26.750
In life, it's not how you start,
it's how you finish,

01:14:26.785 --> 01:14:28.552
because it was looking
a little bit scary.

01:14:28.587 --> 01:14:29.753
Yes.

01:14:29.788 --> 01:14:31.288
But you dug in and got back.

01:14:31.323 --> 01:14:32.789
Good job.

01:14:32.825 --> 01:14:33.835
- Really good job.
- Thank you.

01:14:33.859 --> 01:14:35.125
- Well done.
- Thank you.

01:14:37.596 --> 01:14:40.564
<i>I am so proud of me and Addison.</i>

01:14:40.599 --> 01:14:42.199
Good job, guys.

01:14:42.234 --> 01:14:44.968
Even though we had
some communication problems,

01:14:45.004 --> 01:14:47.738
<i>it brought Addison and I
closer together.</i>

01:14:47.773 --> 01:14:49.217
We did it, we did it,
we did it, we did it.

01:14:49.241 --> 01:14:52.209
Next up, please, Zac and kya.

01:14:52.244 --> 01:14:54.211
<i>I'm feeling really
nervous right now,</i>

01:14:54.246 --> 01:14:56.580
<i>because we're missing
some sauces</i>

01:14:56.615 --> 01:14:58.081
and the spring rolls.

01:14:58.117 --> 01:14:59.950
<i>And it's just so frustrating,</i>

01:14:59.985 --> 01:15:03.053
<i>because kya and I started out
really, really strong.</i>

01:15:03.088 --> 01:15:05.489
<i>I just hope that everything
tastes delicious.</i>

01:15:05.524 --> 01:15:07.224
clearly some things are missing.

01:15:07.259 --> 01:15:08.358
Yes, chef.

01:15:08.394 --> 01:15:10.060
About 20 minutes left,
I was checking in,

01:15:10.095 --> 01:15:12.596
and it seemed that there
was a plan for everything.

01:15:12.631 --> 01:15:13.931
Where did it go wrong?

01:15:13.966 --> 01:15:16.333
I think I would have preferred

01:15:16.368 --> 01:15:17.868
to have been
the person at the end,

01:15:17.903 --> 01:15:19.736
because I can be
extremely quick.

01:15:19.772 --> 01:15:22.239
Who was in charge
of the steamed bun?

01:15:22.274 --> 01:15:23.440
I steamed the bun,

01:15:23.475 --> 01:15:25.008
and then I started
the flank steak,

01:15:25.044 --> 01:15:28.845
and she finished it.

01:15:28.881 --> 01:15:31.281
A little too burnt on the beef.

01:15:31.317 --> 01:15:33.584
Pickles are nice,
hoisin on the bun.

01:15:33.619 --> 01:15:34.585
That's great.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:35.786
Who made the kofta?

01:15:35.821 --> 01:15:37.154
I did, chef.

01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:39.189
It's cooked very well.

01:15:39.224 --> 01:15:43.126
Looks like a beautiful medium.

01:15:43.162 --> 01:15:44.895
- Who seasoned it?
- Kya did.

01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:46.196
You guys try a little bit.

01:15:46.231 --> 01:15:48.899
You tell me if you think
it's five-star seasoning.

01:15:48.934 --> 01:15:53.370
- That's a little bland.
- It is a little bland.

01:15:53.405 --> 01:15:55.305
Who made the filling
for the samosa?

01:15:55.341 --> 01:15:57.941
I cut the potatoes,
put them in the water,

01:15:57.977 --> 01:15:59.242
and seasoned it with salt.

01:15:59.278 --> 01:16:03.747
I like that.
No breading on the Risotto?

01:16:03.782 --> 01:16:05.682
We actually dumped them
in the fryer,

01:16:05.718 --> 01:16:09.019
and we forgot to flour them.

01:16:09.054 --> 01:16:10.432
It's one thing to have
just a couple items

01:16:10.456 --> 01:16:11.955
on the plate and miss a few,

01:16:11.991 --> 01:16:13.802
as long as those things
are pretty near perfect.

01:16:13.826 --> 01:16:17.361
Here, under-seasoned, burnt,
very all-over-the-place,

01:16:17.396 --> 01:16:19.730
which is the last thing
I expected from you two.

01:16:19.765 --> 01:16:22.065
I really, really thought
you guys were the frontrunners,

01:16:22.101 --> 01:16:25.369
and now this makes me
definitely second-guess that.

01:16:25.404 --> 01:16:27.604
<i>Right now I'm feeling
like we're doomed,</i>

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.673
because we had a lot
of problems.

01:16:29.708 --> 01:16:31.108
<i>But then, at the same time,</i>

01:16:31.143 --> 01:16:34.144
maybe someone else had
as much trouble as we did.

01:16:34.179 --> 01:16:36.013
<i>I just really hope that
we did enough</i>

01:16:36.048 --> 01:16:37.848
<i>to continue
inside this competition.</i>

01:16:37.883 --> 01:16:39.583
Next up, jj and Avery.

01:16:39.618 --> 01:16:41.151
Let's go, please.

01:16:41.186 --> 01:16:43.487
<i>Even though me and
Avery had a rocky start</i>

01:16:43.522 --> 01:16:45.555
and we don't know much
about these street foods,

01:16:45.591 --> 01:16:47.524
<i>I think we cooked our hearts out</i>

01:16:47.559 --> 01:16:49.993
and did a pretty darn good job.

01:16:50.029 --> 01:16:51.294
All right, so...

01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:53.430
How do you feel like you did?

01:16:53.465 --> 01:16:55.799
We didn't get two
sauces on the plate,

01:16:55.834 --> 01:16:57.334
and we didn't
get our spring rolls,

01:16:57.369 --> 01:17:00.303
but I think it went pretty well.

01:17:00.339 --> 01:17:01.838
It was the hardest thing

01:17:01.874 --> 01:17:03.373
I've ever done in my life.

01:17:03.409 --> 01:17:05.253
Yeah, I think
there was a lot to do,

01:17:05.277 --> 01:17:07.344
and certainly
a lot at stake tonight.

01:17:07.379 --> 01:17:09.379
All right,
let's do the bao first.

01:17:09.415 --> 01:17:13.417
The meat looks well-cooked,
nice and tender.

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.553
Mm, great flavor, spot on.

01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:19.056
Only thing missing, I'd say,
is the hoisin.

01:17:19.091 --> 01:17:20.624
All right, kofta.

01:17:24.596 --> 01:17:28.131
There's some uneven cooking,
but great flavor.

01:17:28.167 --> 01:17:31.868
I'm really drawn
to these beautiful samosas.

01:17:31.904 --> 01:17:34.204
The filling is really lovely.

01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:37.507
Thank you, chef.

01:17:37.543 --> 01:17:39.743
- Mm.
- you like the crunch?

01:17:39.778 --> 01:17:41.311
The filling is spot on.

01:17:41.346 --> 01:17:42.412
You seasoned it very well,

01:17:42.448 --> 01:17:44.715
and your assembly of it
was really nice.

01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:45.949
Thank you, chef.

01:17:45.984 --> 01:17:47.662
You guys did
a great job tonight.

01:17:47.686 --> 01:17:49.986
The things that you did,
you did well.

01:17:50.022 --> 01:17:52.989
I think you guys have some
real stars on this platter.

01:17:53.025 --> 01:17:56.226
- Nice job.
- Thank you, chef.

01:17:56.261 --> 01:17:58.995
- Amazing job.
- Thank you.

01:17:59.031 --> 01:18:00.397
Sam and kamilly, please.

01:18:00.432 --> 01:18:01.832
Let's go.

01:18:01.867 --> 01:18:03.233
<i>I'm really worried,</i>

01:18:03.268 --> 01:18:06.670
<i>because our platter
is just all over the place.</i>

01:18:06.705 --> 01:18:10.273
<i>Kamilly and I were really
not communicating at all.</i>

01:18:10.309 --> 01:18:12.342
And that's exactly
what zak wanted,

01:18:12.377 --> 01:18:15.145
<i>because this challenge
was all about communication.</i>

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:17.881
On a scale of one to ten, Sam,
how tough was that?

01:18:17.916 --> 01:18:19.349
- Ten.
- ten.

01:18:19.384 --> 01:18:21.151
Let's talk about what's missing.

01:18:21.186 --> 01:18:26.156
The arancini, we're missing
the marinara sauce.

01:18:26.191 --> 01:18:28.959
Between the both of you,
the communication

01:18:28.994 --> 01:18:31.294
was like two individuals
working in one challenge.

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:33.063
Why did that break down, Sam?

01:18:33.098 --> 01:18:34.931
I think we were overwhelmed

01:18:34.967 --> 01:18:36.711
with the different things
that we had to make.

01:18:36.735 --> 01:18:38.502
Okay, kofta.

01:18:38.537 --> 01:18:39.569
Who cooked these?

01:18:39.605 --> 01:18:40.670
I did, chef.

01:18:40.706 --> 01:18:42.205
Just touch them for me.

01:18:42.241 --> 01:18:44.174
That's soft in the middle
there, right?

01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:45.776
Yes, chef.

01:18:45.811 --> 01:18:47.211
When you open it up inside,

01:18:47.246 --> 01:18:49.880
unfortunately,
the only thing that's missing

01:18:49.915 --> 01:18:51.481
is the wool.

01:18:51.517 --> 01:18:52.827
If you put the wool
back on there,

01:18:52.851 --> 01:18:54.451
we can put that thing
back in the field,

01:18:54.486 --> 01:18:55.852
because that's raw.

01:19:00.324 --> 01:19:02.424
Okay, kofta.

01:19:02.459 --> 01:19:03.759
If you open it up inside,

01:19:03.794 --> 01:19:06.528
unfortunately,
the only thing that's missing

01:19:06.563 --> 01:19:07.929
is the wool.

01:19:07.965 --> 01:19:09.109
If we put the wool
back on there,

01:19:09.133 --> 01:19:10.799
we can put that thing
back in the field,

01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:12.934
because that's raw.

01:19:12.970 --> 01:19:14.870
Okay, spring roll.

01:19:14.905 --> 01:19:16.071
Who rolled these?

01:19:16.106 --> 01:19:17.072
I did, chef.

01:19:17.107 --> 01:19:18.206
And what's in there?

01:19:18.242 --> 01:19:20.475
It's napa cabbage, carrots,

01:19:20.511 --> 01:19:25.213
red pepper, cucumber,
and shrimp.

01:19:25.249 --> 01:19:28.383
Ah, the samosa filling
is done beautifully.

01:19:28.419 --> 01:19:29.951
Who cooked the potatoes?

01:19:29.987 --> 01:19:31.319
I did.

01:19:31.355 --> 01:19:32.521
Here's the thing.

01:19:32.556 --> 01:19:33.833
The spring rolls,
you nailed beautifully.

01:19:33.857 --> 01:19:34.956
You guys got that right.

01:19:34.992 --> 01:19:36.658
Love the samosa.

01:19:36.693 --> 01:19:38.293
Unfortunately,
I can't eat the lamb,

01:19:38.328 --> 01:19:39.773
and the beef
is so undercooked as well.

01:19:39.797 --> 01:19:43.665
I think if you were to work
at this challenge individually,

01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:45.133
you would have done
a better job.

01:19:45.169 --> 01:19:47.035
Thank you.

01:19:47.071 --> 01:19:50.305
Incredible dishes tonight,
but there were some downsides.

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:52.040
<i>I'm really sad
that kamilly and I</i>

01:19:52.076 --> 01:19:55.043
weren't able to replicate
the judges' platter.

01:19:55.079 --> 01:19:56.311
<i>I'm really hoping that we did</i>

01:19:56.346 --> 01:19:58.480
just a little bit better
than Zac and kya,

01:19:58.515 --> 01:20:00.649
<i>because I've come so far,</i>

01:20:00.684 --> 01:20:02.350
and I don't want to go home yet.

01:20:02.386 --> 01:20:05.253
- Happy?
- mm-hmm.

01:20:05.289 --> 01:20:06.388
All of you, well done,

01:20:06.423 --> 01:20:07.901
and that was a very
difficult challenge

01:20:07.925 --> 01:20:11.426
that you all had to face.

01:20:11.462 --> 01:20:16.865
Sadly, we do have to say
good-bye to some of you tonight.

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:18.100
But first the good news.

01:20:18.135 --> 01:20:22.637
There was one team that
totally stood out.

01:20:22.673 --> 01:20:26.675
They had a really crazy,
hardcore, emotional 60 minutes,

01:20:26.710 --> 01:20:29.778
but somehow what they
put together was remarkable.

01:20:29.813 --> 01:20:33.548
That team was Addison and Amaya.

01:20:33.584 --> 01:20:36.318
Yes, oh, my gosh!

01:20:36.353 --> 01:20:39.020
Good job, am-Addison.

01:20:39.056 --> 01:20:40.422
Congratulations, ladies.

01:20:40.457 --> 01:20:42.791
And now for the harder part.

01:20:42.826 --> 01:20:45.760
The following two teams,
please come down

01:20:45.796 --> 01:20:48.597
and stand in the front.

01:20:48.632 --> 01:20:50.165
Sam and kamilly.

01:20:54.204 --> 01:20:56.505
Zac and kya,
please step forward.

01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.106
<i>I'm so disappointed right now,</i>

01:20:58.142 --> 01:20:59.841
because I had the advantage.

01:20:59.877 --> 01:21:01.109
I got to pick the teams.

01:21:01.145 --> 01:21:04.880
I picked the person I wanted,
and it backfired.

01:21:04.915 --> 01:21:07.415
All four of you, well done.

01:21:07.451 --> 01:21:11.319
We hate saying good-bye
to anyone at this stage,

01:21:11.355 --> 01:21:16.358
but neither of your performances
were on top tonight.

01:21:16.393 --> 01:21:19.794
One team just did sufficient

01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:22.564
to keep their necks
above the water.

01:21:22.599 --> 01:21:24.733
The other team, sadly,

01:21:24.768 --> 01:21:28.837
have cooked for the last time
in this competition.

01:21:28.872 --> 01:21:32.274
Please step forward...

01:21:32.309 --> 01:21:35.177
Sam and kamilly.

01:21:36.713 --> 01:21:38.413
I'm sorry, but tonight

01:21:38.448 --> 01:21:43.185
is your last time
inside the masterchef kitchen.

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.053
Zac and kya,

01:21:45.088 --> 01:21:47.689
please, say good-bye
to kamilly and Sam.

01:21:47.724 --> 01:21:49.524
- Sorry, Sam.
- Bye.

01:21:51.562 --> 01:21:53.595
- Good job, Sam.
- Thanks, you too.

01:22:00.437 --> 01:22:02.771
Sam, kamilly,

01:22:02.806 --> 01:22:06.208
unfortunately, there were
too many errors on that platter.

01:22:06.243 --> 01:22:08.543
The one ingredient
that was missing

01:22:08.579 --> 01:22:10.812
was your communication.

01:22:10.847 --> 01:22:13.648
Just remember one thing when you
walk through those doors.

01:22:13.684 --> 01:22:17.152
At your age,
Christina, Graham, and myself

01:22:17.187 --> 01:22:21.089
were nowhere near
as good as you two.

01:22:21.124 --> 01:22:23.391
The world is your oyster.

01:22:24.661 --> 01:22:26.761
Both of you, please,
come and say good-bye.

01:22:26.797 --> 01:22:29.297
We're gonna miss you both.

01:22:29.333 --> 01:22:31.066
Come here.

01:22:31.101 --> 01:22:32.367
Well done, my darling.

01:22:32.402 --> 01:22:34.113
If you ever decide
you want to be a pastry chef,

01:22:34.137 --> 01:22:37.172
you know who's rooting for you.

01:22:37.207 --> 01:22:38.840
Kamilly, ladies first.

01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:40.053
In your mind,
who's gonna become America's

01:22:40.077 --> 01:22:41.176
next masterchef junior?

01:22:41.211 --> 01:22:42.444
Addison.

01:22:42.479 --> 01:22:43.445
Sam?

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:45.347
- Zac.
- Zac.

01:22:45.382 --> 01:22:47.048
All right, guys, well done.

01:22:47.084 --> 01:22:48.883
- Good night.
- Good night, guys.

01:22:53.924 --> 01:22:56.725
Oh, kamilly.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.561
I'm really sad
that I have to go home,

01:22:59.596 --> 01:23:01.563
<i>but I did a lot in this kitchen.</i>

01:23:01.598 --> 01:23:02.897
Yeah!

01:23:04.835 --> 01:23:06.835
I'm never gonna forget
the marshmallow challenge...

01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:08.370
Marshmallows.

01:23:08.405 --> 01:23:09.405
<i>And the croquembouche,</i>

01:23:09.439 --> 01:23:11.106
<i>because it showed that,</i>

01:23:11.141 --> 01:23:14.109
even though I don't like baking,
I'm really good at it.

01:23:14.144 --> 01:23:17.445
If a new pastry cook at milk bar

01:23:17.481 --> 01:23:20.048
brought me this
on their first day of work,

01:23:20.083 --> 01:23:23.718
I would give them
a raise immediately.

01:23:23.754 --> 01:23:25.186
<i>I'm really proud of myself</i>

01:23:25.222 --> 01:23:26.532
for making it
in this competition.

01:23:26.556 --> 01:23:27.656
Really lovely dish.

01:23:27.691 --> 01:23:29.824
Really shows that you
do know how to cook.

01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.027
<i>Because millions
and millions tried out,</i>

01:23:32.062 --> 01:23:33.795
and I made it to the top eight.

01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:34.963
Blue team!

01:23:37.801 --> 01:23:39.134
<i>I get to go back home</i>

01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:41.436
with my head held up high
to my fifth grade class

01:23:41.471 --> 01:23:43.405
and brag to all my friends
that I got to meet

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:48.176
<i>chef ramsay, Graham Elliot,
Christina tosi.</i>

01:23:48.211 --> 01:23:50.312
This is gonna be an experience
that I'll never forget

01:23:50.347 --> 01:23:52.380
as long as I live.

01:23:52.416 --> 01:23:54.616
We'll never forget you.

01:23:58.522 --> 01:23:59.688
<i>Next week...</i>

01:23:59.723 --> 01:24:03.792
welcome to... ramsayville.

01:24:03.827 --> 01:24:04.893
Go, go, go!

01:24:04.928 --> 01:24:05.938
<i>The final six...</i>

01:24:05.962 --> 01:24:07.529
Whoa.

01:24:07.564 --> 01:24:08.975
<i>Tackle the most
intimidating challenge...</i>

01:24:08.999 --> 01:24:10.231
Those are burnt, ooh.

01:24:10.267 --> 01:24:11.907
<i>In "masterchef junior" history.</i>

01:24:11.935 --> 01:24:13.546
- That one's missing fish.
- What are you doing?

01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:16.805
<i>These are
michelin-star dishes...</i>

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.273
Overcooked.

01:24:18.308 --> 01:24:20.508
<i>For owners of
michelin-star restaurants.</i>

01:24:20.544 --> 01:24:21.810
This is burnt.

01:24:21.845 --> 01:24:24.179
I'm only 9 years old.

01:24:24.214 --> 01:24:25.847
- Aah!
- jj.

01:24:25.882 --> 01:24:27.782
Oh, man.
