WEBVTT

00:12.795 --> 00:14.275
Fuck you!

00:15.102 --> 00:17.539
Candice?
Candice, can you hear me?

00:17.582 --> 00:19.584
I will kill you, bitch.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.500
- I want to help you, Candice.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.415
But you do need to answer
a few questions.

00:24.459 --> 00:26.809
Fuck you!
I don't need an exorcism.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.332
Well, that's good

00:28.376 --> 00:31.118
- because I'm not an exorcist.

00:31.161 --> 00:32.728
I'm a psychologist.

00:32.771 --> 00:35.035
And I'm here to see
if you might...

00:38.255 --> 00:41.345
I'm here to see if you have
any symptoms of mental illness.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.607
I don't understand.

00:42.651 --> 00:45.001
Why can't you just do it?
Look at her.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.350
It's a process, Ms. Berganza.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.091
We have to determine
if there's something else

00:48.135 --> 00:49.440
that could have caused this.

00:49.484 --> 00:50.920
Caused this?
What else could cause this?

00:50.963 --> 00:53.053
Candice, have you experimented
with any drugs?

00:53.096 --> 00:54.054
Fuck you!

00:55.751 --> 00:58.493
I saw in your chart
that you were diagnosed

00:58.536 --> 01:00.843
with ADHD when you were younger.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.194
Did you ever take
any medication for that?

01:06.066 --> 01:08.416
Candice,
I'm gonna help you, okay?

01:12.072 --> 01:14.117
This is going to be over soon.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.815
But I need you to answer
a few questions.

01:16.859 --> 01:17.947
When you were younger,

01:17.990 --> 01:20.123
did you ever take
any medications?

01:22.169 --> 01:24.388
I'm going to help you...

01:51.589 --> 01:53.765
What is that? VidTap?

01:53.809 --> 01:56.812
Well, you know how TikTok
replaced Instagram?

01:58.161 --> 01:59.858
Okay, so VidTap replaced TikTok.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.425
God, I feel old.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.253
So, this is Candice's
VidTap stream.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.126
She shot her own possession?

02:06.169 --> 02:07.388
Yes.

02:09.303 --> 02:10.565
Oh, my God.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.132
It gets worse.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.091
Is that real?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.745
We think so.

02:16.788 --> 02:18.834
She had stitches in
her mouth from the cuts, so...

02:18.877 --> 02:21.184
H-How long ago was that?

02:21.228 --> 02:22.272
Two weeks.

02:22.316 --> 02:23.447
And is she like that now?

02:23.491 --> 02:25.536
A version of that.

02:25.580 --> 02:26.798
Oh, okay.

02:28.452 --> 02:31.020
I-I'll contact Father Amara.
W-We need to get going on this.

02:31.063 --> 02:32.587
I'm not sure about that.

02:33.327 --> 02:36.068
- What do you mean?
- Why is she recording all these?

02:36.112 --> 02:37.157
Wh-Why does it matter?

02:37.200 --> 02:38.506
Well, I just think it's weird.

02:38.549 --> 02:41.204
Right? I mean,
she's chewing glass,

02:41.248 --> 02:42.510
she's out of control, but...

02:42.553 --> 02:43.989
she makes sure
that the camera can see

02:44.033 --> 02:45.208
the blood in her mouth.

02:45.252 --> 02:46.644
While you figure out
what that means,

02:46.688 --> 02:49.125
I-I'll brief Amara on this.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.523
You think it was faked?

02:55.566 --> 02:57.655
No, I think the,
uh, blood is real.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.049
I think the stitches are real.
I just don't understand.

03:00.092 --> 03:02.443
She's got eight other videos
of her possession,

03:02.486 --> 03:06.186
and each of them are perfectly
timed to the length of the app.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.579
Hmm. You think her mom's
recording them?

03:08.623 --> 03:10.755
Maybe, but that's pretty sick.

03:10.799 --> 03:14.063
Uh, oh, Kristen,
there was one more thing.

03:14.106 --> 03:18.850
The archdiocese did
an investigation of Mr. Townsend

03:18.894 --> 03:20.504
visiting your daughter
at school.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.289
- Luxanne.
- Lexis.

03:22.332 --> 03:23.594
You'll be pleased to know

03:23.638 --> 03:25.640
that we found
no impropriety there.

03:25.683 --> 03:29.078
Leland was purely at the school
at the request of a teacher.

03:29.121 --> 03:31.123
That's how he saw your daughter.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.125
It was by accident, that's all.

03:33.909 --> 03:35.998
- On four separate occasions?
- He was there at the request

03:36.041 --> 03:39.219
of a teacher,
Ms. Christine Rutherford.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.524
And four times
he asked my daughter

03:40.568 --> 03:41.743
to lie about seeing him.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.048
Well, actually,

03:43.092 --> 03:44.528
the archdiocese found
no evidence of that lie.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.051
Except from my daughter?

03:46.095 --> 03:48.706
We've talked to all
the teachers at the school.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.448
They swear that Leland
has been perfectly professional

03:51.492 --> 03:52.797
in his approach to children.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.538
But in an abundance of caution,

03:54.582 --> 03:57.106
we've asked Leland to
no longer visit the school.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.587
I'm sorry...

04:01.415 --> 04:03.460
- It likes it here.
- Okay, serious time.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.462
We need to talk about Leland.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.551
- Why?
- The archdiocese says

04:07.595 --> 04:09.727
he's innocent and he can do
whatever he wants,

04:09.771 --> 04:12.861
so we're gonna have to rely
on each other now, okay?

04:12.904 --> 04:14.123
What's that mean?

04:14.166 --> 04:15.385
We're going to talk
about emergency plans.

04:15.429 --> 04:16.734
These are cards that I made up.

04:16.778 --> 04:18.301
They have all of our numbers,

04:18.345 --> 04:19.824
police numbers,
and emergency plans

04:19.868 --> 04:21.522
for what to do
when he approaches you

04:21.565 --> 04:22.784
at home or at school.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.264
I'm gonna put these
in your backpacks

04:24.307 --> 04:25.787
- with your school ID.
- Wow, Mom.

04:25.830 --> 04:28.398
We are taking this
seriously, okay?

04:28.442 --> 04:30.444
All right. Go get ready for bed.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.881
I'm gonna be working in my room.

04:34.535 --> 04:37.059
- Wow, Mom doesn't seem good.
- I know.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.191
We need to do something
about Leland.

04:39.235 --> 04:42.151
Well, we could kill him.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.283
Poison him.

04:43.326 --> 04:44.719
I'm actually on board with that

04:44.762 --> 04:46.111
- at this point.
- That's not even funny.

04:46.155 --> 04:47.112
We could ask Grandma.

04:49.114 --> 04:51.291
- Guys. Guys.
- What?

04:51.334 --> 04:54.119
He's still on <i>Bumblebee Valley.</i>

04:57.079 --> 04:58.907
Hello, Lynda.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.170
It's your old friend
Pollie the Pig.

05:01.213 --> 05:02.345
What are you doing?

05:05.696 --> 05:08.960
Hi, Pollie. I don't know.
I'm kind of sad.

05:09.004 --> 05:12.137
Well, tell Pollie why.
Maybe I can help.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.356
Tell him it's about Mom.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.053
No, no, tell him
you're angry at Mom.

05:15.097 --> 05:16.620
No, you should say you took
his advice, but it didn't work.

05:16.664 --> 05:17.926
Oh, yeah.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.668
I tried that prank on my mom,

05:20.711 --> 05:22.365
but she found the pills
in her dinner.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.453
Now I'm in trouble.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.499
Did you crush the pills first?

05:25.542 --> 05:28.458
It has to be a powder.
Then you can stir it in.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.330
He's toast.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.645
You guys seen the one
with the bloody tears?

06:24.688 --> 06:25.907
- Just now.
- Yeah, it's official.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.735
Everyone on the Internet
is possessed.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.780
- How many are there?
- Thousands.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.869
- I barely scratched the surface.
- Mm.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.523
- It's addictive.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.395
It's like eating potato chips.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.358

<i>Satan is my name!</i>

06:43.838 --> 06:45.492
- These aren't real, right?
- I think the reality

06:45.535 --> 06:47.581
is that there's
a mental health epidemic.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.060
Not a possession epidemic.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.889
But Candice was eating glass.
She had stitches.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.424
What?

07:04.467 --> 07:07.427
I've heard that before
in other possession videos.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.558
What?

07:08.602 --> 07:10.560
That growl with the Latin.

07:10.604 --> 07:13.171
Okay, this is
a source function key.

07:13.215 --> 07:16.653
It will find every video
that uses that sound.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.656
Okay, so she copied it.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.658
Oh, a lot of people copied it.

07:21.702 --> 07:24.139
But let's see where
they all copied it from.

07:27.925 --> 07:30.754
There's the root of the tree.

07:42.636 --> 07:43.767
So?

07:43.811 --> 07:45.029
That's where I got
the Latin phrase

07:45.073 --> 07:46.770
- to summon the devil.
- No.

07:46.814 --> 07:50.382
That's where you got
the sound file to lip-synch to.

07:50.426 --> 07:51.601
Mom.

07:51.645 --> 07:52.907
Get them out of here.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.822
I-I don't understand, Father.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.780
- Are you saying
none of this is real?
- No.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.303
Candice really ate glass.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.218
But she's doing that
because she's influenced

08:00.262 --> 08:01.350
by this magician,

08:01.393 --> 08:02.656
The Great Heller.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.702
He's a magician?

08:05.746 --> 08:06.790
He was a magician.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.009
Now he's using the same tricks

08:08.052 --> 08:09.880
to become a social media
influencer.

08:09.924 --> 08:12.840
I'm gonna leave
some of these for you.

08:13.884 --> 08:17.540
This is what
The Great Heller uses.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.324
Sugar glass.

08:21.239 --> 08:23.981
He's a liar who's getting other
people on VidTap to copy him.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.809
Ms. Berganza, your daughter
is not possessed.

08:25.853 --> 08:28.551
However, she is in need
of some professional help.

08:40.737 --> 08:44.698
Okay, so this is
my first VidTap video

08:44.741 --> 08:46.961
and hopefully my last.

08:47.004 --> 08:51.008
But I think that too many kids

08:51.052 --> 08:52.880
The Great Heller.

08:52.923 --> 08:56.274
Okay, he's a magician
and he's using his magic tricks

08:56.318 --> 08:59.582
to make you guys think
that he's possessed.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.584
But he's not, okay?

09:01.628 --> 09:03.673
This is him levitating.

09:06.894 --> 09:10.071
And this is how he does it
in his magic show.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.988
Oh, look at me.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.643
I'm possessed. Look.
It only took me five minutes.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.341
And this is how he eats glass.

09:21.386 --> 09:22.605
Sugar glass.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.608
These are fake blood capsules.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.436
You just bite down on them...

09:30.265 --> 09:31.832
...and there you go.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.181
It's all fake.

09:33.224 --> 09:36.401
Don't be an idiot. Okay?

09:36.445 --> 09:38.055
Just don't hurt yourself.

09:38.099 --> 09:41.493
Don't copy assholes
like this magician

09:41.537 --> 09:45.454
who are just using magic to
make you think they're possessed

09:45.497 --> 09:47.412
so they can rack up likes.

10:19.401 --> 10:22.273
Oh, God.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.153
<i>Hey, moms.</i>
<i>Want to know the perfect way</i>

10:32.196 --> 10:33.589

13:00.780 --> 13:02.042

<i>And-and I need help.</i>

14:33.220 --> 14:35.004
- Hi, everyone.

14:35.048 --> 14:38.181
I love <i>Bumblebee Valley.</i>
It's my favorite game.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.401
But there is one big problem.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.925
Pollie the Pig is a pedophile.

14:44.709 --> 14:45.710
Done.

14:45.754 --> 14:46.973

<i>It's true.</i>

14:47.016 --> 14:48.539
He won't stop
bothering me either.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.193

<i>We looked into it</i>

14:50.237 --> 14:53.849
and found out Piggy567
isn't a 13-year-old girl.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.895
He's a 60-year-old man.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.070
Yuck.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.420
When we found this out,

14:59.463 --> 15:01.248
we started recording
every time he was inappropriate.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.119
Is this your house, Lynda?

15:03.163 --> 15:04.207
Can I see inside?

15:04.251 --> 15:06.470
I'm lonely, Lynda. Aren't you?

15:06.514 --> 15:09.909
I'd rather be alone with you
than with all your friends.

15:09.952 --> 15:13.521
Remember, this is
a 60-year-old man.

15:13.564 --> 15:14.652
Creepy. Creepy.

15:14.696 --> 15:17.003
<i>- What the fuck?
- I agree.</i>

15:17.046 --> 15:18.526
<i>We don't want</i>
<i>pedophiles on here.</i>

15:18.569 --> 15:19.657
We want real kids.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.530
So listen up, Pollie the Pig.
Go away.

15:22.573 --> 15:25.141

<i>Does anyone know</i>
<i>where his house is?</i>

15:25.185 --> 15:26.577
I think we should burn it down.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.797
I think it's over here.
Grab some firewood.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.192
Oh, Lexis, Lexis.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.499
I went on VidTap to see

15:35.543 --> 15:37.414
if anyone was going
through the same thing.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.026
And that's when I found
your video on possessions.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.464
Public service.

15:43.507 --> 15:46.206
Anyway, I-I thought you could...

15:47.337 --> 15:49.470
...figure out
what's going on in my house.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.689
Did Ben tell you
what we do, ma'am?

15:51.733 --> 15:53.169
You're with the Catholic Church.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.954
- You look into hauntings.
- Well,

15:54.997 --> 15:56.433
demonic infestations.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.087
We might not be able
to help you,

15:58.131 --> 16:00.437
but we probably could point you

16:00.481 --> 16:02.657
in the direction
of someone who could.

16:02.700 --> 16:03.963
That's all I want.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.966
I just want someone
to take me seriously.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.272
How are your kids doing, Marie?

16:09.316 --> 16:10.621
You saw the video?

16:10.665 --> 16:12.797
They can't sleep.
And I move them

16:12.841 --> 16:15.626
from room to room,
but then it happens there too.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.628
So we moved out here.

16:19.326 --> 16:20.805
But it's gotten worse.

16:20.849 --> 16:22.285
What do you mean, worse?

16:24.940 --> 16:27.334
I think it's inside them.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.685
This was last night.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.995
Okay, what are we
looking at here?

16:54.491 --> 16:55.927

<i>I heard Mikey screaming,</i>

16:55.971 --> 16:58.626
so I got up and stopped it

16:58.669 --> 17:00.367
before Bran could start
the dryer.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.456
- Sleepwalking?
- Maybe.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.458
This is from two nights ago.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.349
Is it possible that your kids
are playing a prank on you?

17:27.133 --> 17:30.179
They wouldn't.
A-And I don't see how.

17:30.223 --> 17:33.661
Marie, do you mind
if we speak to your kids?

17:39.101 --> 17:41.669
Why did you put your brother
in the dryer, Brandon?

17:42.800 --> 17:45.064
Um, I was hiding him.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.632
Hiding him from what?

17:49.633 --> 17:53.072
The-the thing that comes
into our room at night.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.771
Okay.

17:58.425 --> 18:01.732
And you're sure you're not
doing it to scare your mom?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.822
You don't believe us.

18:04.866 --> 18:08.261
No, we... we're just trying to
find out why this is happening.

18:15.964 --> 18:17.618
Oh, buddy.

18:24.364 --> 18:27.976
So, the house has
a concrete slab foundation.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.544
And the way that concrete
is finished and cures

18:30.587 --> 18:34.548
makes a completely level
slab impossible.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.419
So, you think
the floor's slanted--

18:36.463 --> 18:38.291
that's why the bed moved?

18:39.466 --> 18:41.120
Scientific method.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.387
Well, you solved
one thing, anyway.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.737
- No.
- Why not?

18:49.780 --> 18:51.739
The bed rolled that way.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.133

<i>Look, Marie,</i>

18:54.176 --> 18:56.700
I... I can't tell you anything

18:56.744 --> 18:58.833
without a fuller examination,
but your kids

18:58.876 --> 19:02.271
are terrified of this house,
that's clear.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.187
Do you have anywhere
you could go?

19:05.231 --> 19:06.710
I'm a single mom.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.799
I inherited this house
from my parents. I have nowhere.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.845
Well, I can check
with the Church and see

19:10.888 --> 19:12.325
if there are any options.

19:12.368 --> 19:13.804
The time codes
on all these videos--

19:13.848 --> 19:15.371
it reads around 2:00 a.m.

19:15.415 --> 19:16.981
Is that when
all these things happen?

19:17.025 --> 19:18.635
I think so. Why?

19:18.679 --> 19:20.463
Um, do you have any enemies?

19:20.507 --> 19:22.204
I don't think so.
What do you mean?

19:22.248 --> 19:23.901
Well, there's a chance
that these things

19:23.945 --> 19:26.513
are pranks being pulled by
someone who wants to hurt you.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.993
I mean, do you have any tenants?

19:29.037 --> 19:30.517
No.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.519
A school teacher a few
months ago, but she moved out.

19:32.562 --> 19:33.824
Because she was scared?

19:33.868 --> 19:35.913
Oh, I don't know.
We didn't talk much.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.306
Okay.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.090
Well, we would like to
come back later tonight,

19:39.134 --> 19:40.309
if that's all right.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.181
About 1:00 a.m.?

19:42.224 --> 19:43.617
Okay.

19:43.660 --> 19:46.837
That's how we investigate
infestations.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.012
If that's all right.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.492
Yes, yeah.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.320
I think Brandon and Mikey
will feel safer

19:51.364 --> 19:53.192
with other people here.

19:54.105 --> 19:55.498
So, what are we thinking?

19:55.542 --> 19:57.892
I have no frigging idea.

19:59.459 --> 20:00.851

<i>Who is this guy Ben</i>

20:00.895 --> 20:04.072
<i>to tell us what</i>
<i>is true and what isn't?</i>

20:04.115 --> 20:05.421
<i>He doesn't control facts.</i>

20:09.208 --> 20:10.470
<i>Watch, Ben.</i>

20:15.388 --> 20:16.650
<i>Cotton candy.</i>

20:17.390 --> 20:18.826
Oh, my God.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.916
Are you fucking kidding me?

20:22.743 --> 20:24.527
<i>Okay, I don't control truth,</i>

20:24.571 --> 20:26.790
<i>but if your dryer</i>
<i>is hot enough to melt sugar,</i>

20:26.834 --> 20:28.531
<i>you'd be basically lighting</i>
<i>your clothes on fire</i>

20:28.575 --> 20:30.185
<i>every time you dried them, okay?</i>

20:30.229 --> 20:31.926
<i>Come on, people, just use...</i>

20:32.883 --> 20:34.668
<i>Use your brains.</i>

20:35.451 --> 20:36.974

<i>Yep,</i>

20:37.018 --> 20:38.541
<i>I'm drinking again.</i>

20:39.542 --> 20:41.762
<i>I thought my daughter</i>
<i>was a good girl.</i>

20:43.329 --> 20:47.289
<i>And then I cleaned her room,</i>
<i>and what do you think I found?</i>

20:47.333 --> 20:48.682
<i>That's right.</i>

20:49.770 --> 20:51.293
<i>My daughter is sleeping around.</i>

20:51.337 --> 20:54.557
<i>So I read the best thing</i>
<i>you can do for your kids</i>

20:54.601 --> 20:55.950
<i>is to give them rules.</i>

20:55.993 --> 20:58.518
<i>So I put my house rules</i>
<i>on a chalkboard.</i>

20:59.606 --> 21:01.695
<i>Then I go to clean their rooms,</i>

21:01.738 --> 21:04.263
<i>and guess what I found</i>
<i>on the back.</i>

21:05.046 --> 21:09.268
<i>They replaced my rules</i>
<i>with their rules.</i>

21:42.649 --> 21:43.998
<i>I have dark thoughts.</i>

21:44.041 --> 21:47.436
<i>I have thoughts</i>
<i>of going on Tinder.</i>

21:47.480 --> 21:50.265
<i>I watch online porn,</i>

21:50.309 --> 21:52.528
<i>and all I think about</i>
<i>is being with someone.</i>

21:52.572 --> 21:55.357
<i>All I want to do</i>
<i>is talk to someone.</i>

21:55.401 --> 21:57.054
Talk to me.

22:03.191 --> 22:04.714
No.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.803
I told you it's over.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.806
The sex was over.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.330
Not the talking.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.767
What's wrong with talking?

22:20.164 --> 22:22.471
God, you're so transparent.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.038
What do you mean?

22:24.081 --> 22:26.649
I mean you're using
my weakness against me.

22:26.693 --> 22:29.173
There are things you'd love
to talk to Kristen about,

22:29.217 --> 22:30.871
but you can't, right?

22:32.655 --> 22:34.135
So talk to me.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.833
- I won't bite.
- If there's something

22:36.877 --> 22:39.314
I want to talk to Kristen about,

22:39.358 --> 22:40.707
I'll talk to Kristen.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.885
Well, then talk to her
about the Entity.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.279
See?

22:48.323 --> 22:50.630
You can't.

22:50.673 --> 22:53.110
You promised not to tell anyone.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.505
But here I am.

22:58.725 --> 23:02.685
You're worried the Entity
is using you, right?

23:02.729 --> 23:04.557
I'm not worried.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.907
I know they're using me.
That's the whole point.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.256
Right, but...

23:08.299 --> 23:09.562
what do you owe God?

23:10.258 --> 23:12.173
And what do you owe
these stupid little spies?

23:12.216 --> 23:14.610
- If it saves Grace Ling,
then it's worth it.
- Oh, yeah.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.830
The prophet.

23:18.353 --> 23:19.528
But he hasn't mentioned

23:19.572 --> 23:20.921
Grace Ling
in a long time, right?

23:20.964 --> 23:22.879
How long has it been-- a month?

23:23.837 --> 23:25.665
You say that you think

23:25.708 --> 23:28.189
I'm using your weakness
against you.

23:28.232 --> 23:30.452
I think Victor

23:30.496 --> 23:32.454
knew your weakness about Grace.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.456
That you missed her.

23:35.326 --> 23:36.545
And he's using that.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.155
Using that for what?

23:38.939 --> 23:42.464
Think something about
that Chinese man that died.

23:42.508 --> 23:45.249
All those people in that room.

23:45.859 --> 23:48.775
Why did they want you
to leave the door open?

23:51.081 --> 23:53.170
- I don't care.
- But you do.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.433
That's why you googled it.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.695
Right?

23:56.609 --> 23:58.437
But you couldn't find anything
about a man dying

23:58.480 --> 24:00.743
- at the Hotel Percival, right?
- That means nothing.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.876
It means you can't
trust the Entity.

24:02.919 --> 24:05.182
And I should trust you?

24:06.357 --> 24:07.533
A demon.

24:07.576 --> 24:08.969
David...

24:09.752 --> 24:11.667
I'm not just a demon.

24:12.581 --> 24:13.930
I'm you.

24:15.715 --> 24:17.151
I'm in here.

24:26.203 --> 24:27.466
No.

24:29.163 --> 24:30.817
You know what this is?

24:33.341 --> 24:34.603
I never wanted you back

24:34.647 --> 24:37.476
until I started watching
those VidTap videos.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.044
They're leading me
to temptation.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.918
That's what this is.

25:03.414 --> 25:04.720
David?

25:07.027 --> 25:08.376
David?

25:29.963 --> 25:32.705
David!

25:48.721 --> 25:50.766
Sister, what are you doing?

25:50.810 --> 25:52.159
What are <i>you</i> doing?

25:52.202 --> 25:54.465
Letting that thing
attach itself to you.

25:54.509 --> 25:55.858
What are you talking about?

25:55.902 --> 25:58.644
- That demon.
- Sister, I was just sleeping.

25:58.687 --> 26:00.341
David, there was something
attached to you.

26:00.384 --> 26:01.777
What are you doing?

26:01.821 --> 26:04.040
I'm going out to assess,
that's what I'm doing.

26:04.084 --> 26:06.521
No, you let something
into your life.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.044
Sister, I have to go.

26:08.088 --> 26:11.831
Please, don't come in my room
unless I ask you.

26:23.625 --> 26:26.410
I don't know how anyone thought
I was a 60-year-old man.

26:26.454 --> 26:27.586
As if.

26:29.109 --> 26:31.720
I think I've been too nice here,
trying to make friends.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.940
And some people want to hurt me.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.377
This is my home. Look!

26:37.378 --> 26:38.988
<i>I am 14 years old.</i>

26:39.032 --> 26:41.077
<i>I live in Sun Valley.</i>

26:41.121 --> 26:44.559
My mom is dead.
And now I have nowhere to live.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.647
People should stop

26:45.691 --> 26:46.866
<i>being mean to me.</i>

26:46.909 --> 26:48.607
<i>All I want to do</i>
<i>is make friends.</i>

26:48.650 --> 26:51.000
- Oh, we need
to shut this guy down.
- What are we doing?

26:51.044 --> 26:52.132
- Just watch.
- We're pissing him off.

26:52.175 --> 26:53.655
He's pissing us off.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.526
- Can we please...

26:55.570 --> 26:57.267
Just watch this.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.442
Hey, friends.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.488
We traced the IP address
of Pollie the Pig

27:00.531 --> 27:01.576
to a place called...

27:01.620 --> 27:03.273
St. Joseph's Parish.

27:03.317 --> 27:04.753
<i>- We think it's a church.</i>
And Pollie the Pig

27:04.797 --> 27:07.234
is not a 14-year-old
from Sun Valley.

27:07.277 --> 27:09.802
He's a 60-year-old
named Leland Townsend.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.326
Damn it.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.953
What time is it?

27:34.391 --> 27:36.785
Uh, a few more minutes.

27:40.354 --> 27:42.356
Are you getting a lot
of VidTap notifications?

27:42.399 --> 27:43.966
All the time.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.489
It's addictive, isn't it?

27:45.533 --> 27:46.708
I sat down to watch one video.

27:46.752 --> 27:47.970
I was there for an hour.

27:48.014 --> 27:49.406
Oh, it's the algorithm.

27:49.450 --> 27:50.625
The only way they make money

27:50.669 --> 27:51.713
is if you stay on it.

27:53.236 --> 27:56.370
Is it kind of weird how
it tries to predict who you are?

27:56.413 --> 27:59.025
Yeah, like, it thinks
I'm a mom who drinks a lot.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.767
Maybe you are a mom
who drinks a lot.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.116
Thanks.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.988
And now it thinks I'm mean.
It keeps sending me

28:06.032 --> 28:07.729
these moms who
scream at their daughters.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.513
How does it even know
I have daughters?

28:09.557 --> 28:11.690
It guesses.

28:11.733 --> 28:14.170
It looks at your social media
use, sees what you pause over,

28:14.214 --> 28:16.129
and makes educated guesses.

28:16.172 --> 28:17.391
I think it's more than that.

28:17.434 --> 28:20.699
I started with
thoughtful priests.

28:21.525 --> 28:24.354
Now I'm with suicidal priests.

28:24.398 --> 28:25.791
It's like the more I look at it,
the more

28:25.834 --> 28:28.532
it thinks
I'm into violence and anger.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.796
I'm getting moms who
want to kill their kids now.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.580
Well, it's the American way.

28:33.320 --> 28:36.323
When in doubt,
go with violence and sex.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.109
Our master calls.

28:40.153 --> 28:42.111
It's from Marie.

28:42.155 --> 28:44.026
Oh, I got it too. It's live.

28:44.070 --> 28:45.375
<i>- Is he okay?</i>
- Let me see!

28:45.419 --> 28:47.247
<i>- Let me see!</i>
<i>- Brandon! Brandon!</i>

28:47.290 --> 28:49.205
<i>- Oh, God!</i>
<i>- Brandon!</i>

28:49.249 --> 28:51.642
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>

28:51.686 --> 28:52.905
Oh, my God.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.783
Marie!

29:02.610 --> 29:04.090
Marie!

29:05.439 --> 29:07.789
It's back! It's back!

29:07.833 --> 29:11.053
I can't take it anymore.
Please, I can't...

29:11.097 --> 29:12.751
It scratched him!

29:12.794 --> 29:13.752
What scratched you?

29:13.795 --> 29:15.231
The monster!

29:15.275 --> 29:16.276
Right there.

29:19.061 --> 29:20.280

<i>Why did you</i>

29:20.323 --> 29:21.890
livestream
the surveillance footage?

29:21.934 --> 29:23.065
I didn't.

29:23.109 --> 29:25.154
I don't even know
how to do that.

29:26.503 --> 29:27.591
It's evil.

29:27.635 --> 29:28.810
What is?

29:28.854 --> 29:30.246
VidTap.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.553
Everything was fine
until I started using it.

29:32.596 --> 29:34.947
Now it's taken control
of my account.

29:34.990 --> 29:35.991
What do you mean?

29:36.035 --> 29:37.906
It sent that livestream out.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.342
I didn't.

29:39.386 --> 29:42.432
Maybe your kids
started the livestream?

29:42.476 --> 29:43.825
Oh, my God.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.305
Marie.

29:47.524 --> 29:48.961
Oh, my God!

29:49.004 --> 29:50.658
Holy crap.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.878
Oh, my God.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.621
VidTap can't just start itself.

29:57.665 --> 29:58.622
Are you sure?

29:58.666 --> 29:59.928
In my science group,

29:59.972 --> 30:01.495
there's someone
who works at VidTap.

30:01.538 --> 30:02.801
We can talk to her.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.280
All right,
I'll talk to the Monsignor

30:04.324 --> 30:07.066
and get the ball rolling
towards an infestation exorcism.

30:08.676 --> 30:09.895
Whoa.

30:09.938 --> 30:12.680
Yeah. Are they better?

30:12.723 --> 30:15.074
They're gonna go to sleep
in the living room again.

30:15.117 --> 30:16.945
I told her
to take the kids' phones

30:16.989 --> 30:18.991
and turn off VidTap.

30:19.034 --> 30:21.471
Good advice for us, too.

30:38.140 --> 30:41.404
<i>You know, Ben, fuck you.</i>
<i>You're such an elitist.</i>

30:41.448 --> 30:43.058
<i>This is the way to kill COVID.</i>

30:45.060 --> 30:47.193
Oh, my God.

30:48.194 --> 30:50.674
<i>He was on a business trip</i>
<i>and every night,</i>

30:50.718 --> 30:52.763
<i>the phone calls with him</i>
<i>got weirder and weirder.</i>

30:52.807 --> 30:54.896
<i>That's when you know</i>
<i>he's cheating on you.</i>

30:56.071 --> 30:58.987

<i>Is your husband away</i>
<i>from home too much?</i>

31:22.881 --> 31:25.666
Andy? Andy, are you there?

31:25.709 --> 31:27.407
The reception...
<i>Can you hear me okay?</i>

31:27.450 --> 31:28.495
Fuck.

31:29.975 --> 31:33.239
Yeah, I-I... Some. Barely.
Where are you, on the Col?

31:34.022 --> 31:35.241
<i>No, we're at base camp.</i>

31:35.284 --> 31:37.243
Okay, good.
I-I can hear you now.

31:38.070 --> 31:39.636
How's the rich client?

31:39.680 --> 31:41.551
He's not putting you
in danger, is he?

31:41.595 --> 31:43.902
No, we're fine.
I miss you all so much.

31:43.945 --> 31:44.903
I got to go.

31:44.946 --> 31:47.427
No, wait! Jesus!

31:50.517 --> 31:52.649
I wanted to say
happy anniversary.

31:55.783 --> 31:57.350
<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

31:58.220 --> 32:00.788
I said happy anniversary.

32:00.831 --> 32:02.659
Do you remember the first one?

32:04.009 --> 32:05.662
Uh, I got to go.

32:06.968 --> 32:09.057
What? Are you okay?

32:09.101 --> 32:12.104
Yeah. I love you. Bye.

32:15.629 --> 32:17.457
Damn it.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.553
Why didn't you tell me
it's their anniversary?

32:26.596 --> 32:28.642
- What?
- She says "Happy Anniversary"

32:28.685 --> 32:30.600
and I'm stuck there
like an idiot.

32:30.644 --> 32:32.820
It's not their anniversary.
That's in November.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.041
- Is she onto us?
- No.

32:36.084 --> 32:37.607
She said happy anniversary.

32:37.651 --> 32:39.696
Why would she say that
if she's not trying to trick us?

32:39.740 --> 32:41.568
It's probably, like,
the first time they met

32:41.611 --> 32:44.310
or when they went climbing.
You're overreacting.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.834
I don't like surprises.

32:47.661 --> 32:49.968
Leland, no...
Don't do it. Leland.

32:50.011 --> 32:52.100
Leland.

32:52.144 --> 32:53.580
Don't wake him.

33:00.804 --> 33:04.156
Andy, I need an answer from you.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.248
You know you're gonna spend
the rest of your life here.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.859
But I can make your time here

33:11.902 --> 33:14.688
pleasant or hard.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.560
I know you can't talk,

33:17.604 --> 33:19.345
but you can nod.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.129
So my question is...

33:21.173 --> 33:23.697
is this your anniversary?

33:26.874 --> 33:28.397
Mm.

33:29.616 --> 33:33.315
- Oh, come on.
- It's just water.

33:36.536 --> 33:38.016
Imagine...

33:41.280 --> 33:45.023
I could leave this dripping here
for 40 years.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.026
The first year
you might be fine.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.853
But the third year,

33:49.897 --> 33:51.768
you'd wish you could scream.

33:51.812 --> 33:55.207
Now, is this your
wedding anniversary?

34:00.212 --> 34:02.214
Was it your first date?

34:05.695 --> 34:07.349
Good.

34:07.393 --> 34:10.396
You sit tight.
We'll talk again soon.

34:19.231 --> 34:20.449
Benny the boy genius!

34:20.493 --> 34:23.757
- Hey. Oh.
- Hello.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.237
Welcome to my work crib.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.326
Yeah, yeah, thanks, Katie.
Thanks for seeing us.

34:27.369 --> 34:29.719
Oh, this is my friends,
uh, David and Kristen.

34:29.763 --> 34:31.199
The ones I was
telling you about.

34:31.243 --> 34:33.201
Right.
The priest and the shrink.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.421
Come on back.

34:37.249 --> 34:39.599
- Benny the boy genius?
- No one calls me that.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.732
I think I already know
the answer to this, Katie,

34:42.776 --> 34:45.300
but, uh, can the app
upload a video

34:45.344 --> 34:46.867
from your phone
without your consent?

34:46.910 --> 34:48.173
Can't happen. Won't happen.

34:48.216 --> 34:50.218
The user has to go
into the application

34:50.262 --> 34:52.090
and choose what content
they want to share.

34:52.133 --> 34:53.874
Mkay.

34:53.917 --> 34:56.703
can you view live video
from a person's phone

34:56.746 --> 34:58.226
if they're not recording
into the app?

34:58.270 --> 35:02.230
No. Also impossible.
Also won't happen.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.232
Oh. Well, um...

35:04.276 --> 35:05.799
your turn.

35:07.409 --> 35:09.629
Um, is the app evil?

35:09.672 --> 35:12.675
Whoa. You're the priest, right?

35:12.719 --> 35:14.155
I am.

35:14.199 --> 35:16.462
I like religious people.
They make my job interesting.

35:16.505 --> 35:17.985
My mom is Jehovah Witness.

35:18.028 --> 35:19.639
She still thinks I'm doing
the devil's work here.

35:19.682 --> 35:23.077
Was the app designed
with nefarious intentions?

35:23.121 --> 35:26.036
Do you call bringing
the world together nefarious?

35:26.080 --> 35:27.212
That depends.

35:27.255 --> 35:29.127
Bringing it together for what?

35:29.170 --> 35:31.259
That's up to the world,
isn't it?

35:31.303 --> 35:32.434
Someone gets murdered
at a picnic spot,

35:32.478 --> 35:34.132
you don't blame the picnic spot.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.438
Well, so, the more videos

35:36.482 --> 35:37.918
I watch on the app,

35:37.961 --> 35:39.354
the darker they become.

35:39.398 --> 35:40.921
They become more about

35:40.964 --> 35:43.489
jealousy, anger, hatred.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.360
Well, that's just
what you're choosing.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.971
- Oh, no, but I'm not.
- Look, you may not think you are

35:48.015 --> 35:49.059
but if you hesitate over a video

35:49.103 --> 35:51.279
for just a split second longer,

35:51.323 --> 35:53.020
the algorithm picks up on that.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.196
Then it sends you
another video just like it.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.243
Let's say...
a video about jealousy.

35:58.286 --> 36:00.767
If you do the same thing again--

36:00.810 --> 36:02.943
hesitate just for a second--
even if you eventually

36:02.986 --> 36:04.205
click thumbs down,

36:04.249 --> 36:06.599
it knows that's
what you secretly want.

36:06.642 --> 36:08.557
But what'll grab your attention
isn't always what you want.

36:08.601 --> 36:10.080
Maybe, but our algorithm

36:11.691 --> 36:14.650
keeping you engaged,
not making you a better person.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.174
That's your job, not mine.

36:16.217 --> 36:18.915
And we seem to be doing
a hell of a lot better.

36:24.617 --> 36:26.184
Hope that was helpful.

36:26.227 --> 36:28.447
Um, no, not really.

36:28.490 --> 36:29.926
Well, maybe this will be.

36:31.101 --> 36:32.320
We're not the problem.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.975
Your subject is. Marie Taylor?

36:35.932 --> 36:38.370
How'd you know her name?
I never told you her name.

36:38.413 --> 36:40.894
Ben, VidTap knows
everything about our users.

36:40.937 --> 36:42.678
Stop wasting your time
arguing with

36:42.722 --> 36:45.072
idiotic conspiracy theorists,
by the way.

36:45.899 --> 36:50.295
Marie edited her possession
videos in the application.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.601
- So...
- So, we have access

36:52.645 --> 36:54.864
to the heads and tails
of the footage she shot

36:54.908 --> 36:56.779
before she edited it.

36:58.259 --> 36:59.217
Seriously?

36:59.260 --> 37:01.654
And I can send it to you.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.273
She didn't say what it was?

37:12.317 --> 37:14.449
No.
She's doing us a favor.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.756
She could get in big trouble
for sending this.

37:18.453 --> 37:20.238
Is she your girlfriend?

37:22.152 --> 37:23.589
No.

38:22.996 --> 38:25.085
Oh, no.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.399
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Brandon.</i>

38:34.442 --> 38:35.748
<i>God, are you okay?</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

38:35.791 --> 38:38.838
<i>It burns. My back burns!</i>

38:38.881 --> 38:41.057
<i>- What? Turn over.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God. Brandon!</i>

38:41.101 --> 38:42.798
<i>Brandon, are you okay?</i>

38:42.842 --> 38:44.539
<i>- Let me see.</i>
- What happened?

38:44.583 --> 38:45.975
<i>- What happened?</i>
Let me see!

38:46.019 --> 38:48.543
- Why would she do this?
- Why do you think?

38:48.587 --> 38:50.153
Clout chasing?

38:50.197 --> 38:52.025
Seriously?

38:52.068 --> 38:54.332
- What happened?
What happened?
- Let me see!

38:54.375 --> 38:55.942
Let me see.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.684

<i>Oh, my God!</i>

39:06.518 --> 39:08.824
That simply isn't true.
I would never.

39:08.868 --> 39:12.393
We have the outtakes
of the videos you uploaded.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.482
Those are my kids!

39:14.526 --> 39:15.788
I-I've done everything
to protect them.

39:15.831 --> 39:19.008
Marie, we can find you help.
Let us.

39:19.052 --> 39:20.836
Possessed.

39:21.794 --> 39:23.448
If what you say is true, then...

39:24.536 --> 39:26.842
...I must have been possessed.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.023
Marie, don't.

39:34.067 --> 39:36.635
You don't have to post
everything you do on VidTap.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.941
What exactly
are you gonna post--

39:38.985 --> 39:41.509
us calling you out
on attacking your own children?

39:44.904 --> 39:46.819
- Okay, great.
- Oh, my God.

39:46.862 --> 39:48.908
What is this, Possession 101?

40:08.449 --> 40:11.757
- Aah!
- Oh, whoa!

40:16.718 --> 40:18.590
Call 911.

40:18.633 --> 40:21.680
Satan, they're attacking me!

40:24.813 --> 40:26.554
No!

40:28.643 --> 40:31.080
Hi, friends.
We traced the IP address

40:31.124 --> 40:33.256
of Pollie the Pig
to a place called...

40:33.300 --> 40:35.563

<i>St. Joseph's Parish.</i>
<i>We think it's a church.</i>

40:35.607 --> 40:36.956

<i>And Pollie the Pig</i>

40:36.999 --> 40:39.001
<i>is not a 14-year-old</i>
<i>from Sun Valley.</i>

40:39.045 --> 40:42.004
<i>He's a 60-year-old</i>
<i>named Leland Townsend.</i>

40:42.788 --> 40:45.660
Your excellency,
this is disgusting.

40:45.704 --> 40:47.880
Someone's trying to set me up...

40:47.923 --> 40:48.968
Leland.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.493
I need to thank you
for your months of service.

40:52.537 --> 40:54.103
Monsignor, this is a lie.

40:54.147 --> 40:55.627
Doesn't matter.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.020
You know better than anyone.

40:58.064 --> 41:01.241
The Church cannot
risk the liability

41:01.284 --> 41:02.503
in this matter.

41:02.547 --> 41:05.985
We will, as always,

41:06.028 --> 41:07.987
give you
a positive recommendation

41:08.030 --> 41:10.468
no matter your next ventures.

41:11.338 --> 41:14.994
But I need to ask you
to leave right now.

41:22.654 --> 41:23.916
You're gonna be sorry.

41:23.959 --> 41:26.962
It's a rare day
when I'm not sorry.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.318
Whoa.
What's your problem?

41:35.362 --> 41:38.713
My problem is I think it's time
to make four little girls

41:38.757 --> 41:40.498
four little orphans!

42:48.304 --> 42:51.612
Oof. Your cuticles are dry.

42:51.656 --> 42:53.571
Don't worry.

42:53.614 --> 42:55.529
I don't want to hurt Kristen.

42:56.269 --> 42:59.446
In, uh, a month or two,
Edward will call her,

42:59.489 --> 43:00.882
tearful,

43:00.926 --> 43:03.755
and say that you were killed
in an avalanche.

43:03.798 --> 43:05.800
Your body will never
be recovered.

43:05.844 --> 43:08.586
You saved Edward
and three other climbers

43:08.629 --> 43:10.718
before being swept away.

43:10.762 --> 43:12.720
Your daughters will think
you were a great man,

43:12.764 --> 43:15.593
and will aspire to emulate you.

43:16.463 --> 43:19.292
Edward is so appreciative that

43:19.335 --> 43:22.425
not only does he give your
family the original $800,000,

43:22.469 --> 43:27.474
but an additional $250,000
for the kids' education.

43:27.517 --> 43:29.128
So...

43:29.868 --> 43:31.870
...you're of more use
to them gone

43:31.913 --> 43:34.002
than back home.

43:37.397 --> 43:38.790
Okay.

43:38.833 --> 43:40.966
I'll keep you updated
on how they're doing.

43:41.009 --> 43:44.273
Oh, and I'll bring some oil
next time for those cuticles.

43:44.317 --> 43:45.361
Okay.
