00:08.000 --> 00:09.792
TIM:
<i>I just can't believe</i>

00:09.875 --> 00:11.583
that Clementine
might be pregnant.

00:11.667 --> 00:14.834
Oh, God, I know. We are way
too young to be grandparents.

00:14.917 --> 00:16.834
Right?
My neck is still taut.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.250
A stranger told me
that yesterday.

00:18.333 --> 00:20.166
I mean, it was weird
that they just said it,

00:20.250 --> 00:21.750
but it felt very nice.

00:21.834 --> 00:23.583
-You're gonna be
such a hot grandma.

00:21.834 --> 00:23.583
-Oh, thank you.

00:23.667 --> 00:26.458
I haven't said that since
I was a kid to my own grandma.

00:26.542 --> 00:27.875
-(door opens)
-Ooh.

00:27.959 --> 00:29.375
(door closes)

00:30.750 --> 00:31.834
False alarm.

00:31.917 --> 00:33.959
Oh, thank goodness.

00:34.041 --> 00:35.291
We read the test wrong.

00:35.375 --> 00:36.959
Yeah, it turns out

00:35.375 --> 00:36.959
that a minus sign

00:37.041 --> 00:38.959
means that you're <i>not </i>pregnant.

00:39.041 --> 00:40.250
Why would they do that?

00:40.333 --> 00:43.291
A minus sign looks exactly

00:40.333 --> 00:43.291
like a sleeping flat baby.

00:43.375 --> 00:47.083
Yeah, okay, I hope that you guys

00:43.375 --> 00:47.083
learned a lesson here.

00:47.166 --> 00:49.625
Is the lesson that

00:47.166 --> 00:49.625
babies aren't flat?

00:49.709 --> 00:52.583
No, that you need

00:49.709 --> 00:52.583
to be more careful.

00:52.667 --> 00:55.250
Oh, we'll be careful.

00:52.667 --> 00:55.250
We don't want to ever have kids.

00:55.333 --> 00:56.583
I'm sorry, what?

00:56.667 --> 00:59.417
We just don't identify

00:56.667 --> 00:59.417
as selfless,

00:59.500 --> 01:01.417
and we're not sure we ever will.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.417
What do you mean you don't want

01:01.500 --> 01:04.417
kids? Everybody wants kids.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.041
I don't.

01:06.125 --> 01:08.125
Of course you do.

01:08.208 --> 01:10.083
Kids are a burden

01:08.208 --> 01:10.083
on the environment.

01:10.166 --> 01:12.125
You're a burden

01:10.166 --> 01:12.125
on the environment.

01:12.208 --> 01:13.417
You've proven my point.

01:13.500 --> 01:14.917
Don't try

01:13.500 --> 01:14.917
to outsmart your mother.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.542
Don't you want joy in your life?

01:16.625 --> 01:19.625
Look at how much joy you guys

01:16.625 --> 01:19.625
bring us! Just look at it!

01:20.709 --> 01:23.542
Well, I want a ton of kids.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.583
See! Sophia's gonna

01:23.625 --> 01:25.583
continue the bloodline,

01:25.667 --> 01:27.250
and it's gonna be beautiful.

01:27.333 --> 01:29.041
No, no. I'm gonna adopt.

01:29.125 --> 01:32.000
Sophia, you go up to your room

01:29.125 --> 01:32.000
and you don't come back down

01:32.083 --> 01:34.291
-here till you're pregnant.

01:32.083 --> 01:34.291
-Okay...

01:36.291 --> 01:38.875
TIM: <i>I know we didn't want</i>

01:36.291 --> 01:38.875
<i>Clementine to be pregnant,</i>

01:38.959 --> 01:40.709
but part of me kind of did.

01:40.792 --> 01:43.834
Oh, Tim, honestly,

01:40.792 --> 01:43.834
you know what? I-I did, too.

01:43.917 --> 01:46.917
Well, I guess it's gonna be a

01:43.917 --> 01:46.917
while before we have grandkids.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.333
We could always have

01:47.000 --> 01:49.333
our own grandkids.

01:49.417 --> 01:51.000
What do you mean,

01:49.417 --> 01:51.000
like hillbillies?

01:51.083 --> 01:52.583
No, I'm saying we're

01:51.083 --> 01:52.583
still young enough

01:52.667 --> 01:54.291
to have another

01:52.667 --> 01:54.291
child of our own.

01:54.375 --> 01:57.458
(scoffs) Tim, come on, babe,

01:54.375 --> 01:57.458
I'm early 40s. Mm-mmm.

01:57.542 --> 01:59.542
-Well, you're mid-40s.

01:57.542 --> 01:59.542
-What?

01:59.625 --> 02:04.125
43 is early 40s.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.333
I don't think so.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.000
-Yeah, no, I think it is.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.000
-I'm a doctor.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.834
Okay, why you trying

02:07.083 --> 02:08.834
to make me older?

02:08.917 --> 02:11.792
And do I need to remind you

02:08.917 --> 02:11.792
that you had a vasectomy?

02:11.875 --> 02:13.792
-Yeah, but I can

02:11.875 --> 02:13.792
get that reversed.

02:11.875 --> 02:13.792
-(scoffs)

02:13.875 --> 02:15.208
Or we could do IVF.

02:15.291 --> 02:16.750
What is going on with you?

02:16.834 --> 02:18.583
I just feel like

02:16.834 --> 02:18.583
the-the three best things

02:18.667 --> 02:21.667
I ever did in my life are the

02:18.667 --> 02:21.667
three kids that I made with you,

02:21.750 --> 02:23.500
so why wouldn't I

02:21.750 --> 02:23.500
want to do that again?

02:23.583 --> 02:26.083
Oh, Tim, come on, no, don't

02:23.583 --> 02:26.083
take me down that road. I...

02:26.166 --> 02:28.542
Shh.

02:26.166 --> 02:28.542
Come down the road.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.375
(chuckles)

02:28.625 --> 02:30.375
No. Stop it.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.458
-It's a nice road

02:30.458 --> 02:32.458
with lots of babies.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.458
-Stop.

02:32.542 --> 02:34.125
-Not on the road,

02:32.542 --> 02:34.125
'cause that'd be dangerous,

02:32.542 --> 02:34.125
-No, that's weird.

02:34.208 --> 02:36.834
but up on the sidewalk,

02:36.917 --> 02:39.125
holding hands with...

02:36.917 --> 02:39.125
caregivers.

02:39.208 --> 02:40.709
Come on, say yes.

02:40.792 --> 02:43.875
Okay, if it is that important to
you, there are some options...

02:43.959 --> 02:46.333
-We're having a baby!
-Oh.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.166
Honey.

02:50.750 --> 02:52.291
So how's it looking down there?

02:52.375 --> 02:56.041
Bad. Real bad. This was botched
eight ways from Sunday.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.709
-Who did this vasectomy?
-You did.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.542
(scoffs)
No.

03:00.625 --> 03:02.875
-Yes!
-No way I did this.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.667
Wh-Wh-Why? What are you
seeing down there?

03:04.750 --> 03:06.583
Look, whoever did this to you...

03:06.667 --> 03:07.667
You... It was you!

03:07.750 --> 03:10.041
Imagine we're carving a pumpkin.

03:10.125 --> 03:13.834
You reach in,
you scoop out the seeds,

03:13.917 --> 03:16.542
all the goop,
and you plop it on the side.

03:16.625 --> 03:20.583
Now picture taking
that goo and ramming it

03:20.667 --> 03:22.959
back in the pumpkin.

03:23.041 --> 03:26.500
That's what we're gonna do
to your scrotum.

03:26.583 --> 03:28.542
But then I'll be able
to have kids?

03:30.208 --> 03:32.250
Oh, no.

03:32.333 --> 03:33.542
Can I be honest with you?

03:33.625 --> 03:35.125
You've been sugarcoating
it till now?

03:35.208 --> 03:37.125
This is gonna hurt so bad, man.

03:37.208 --> 03:40.125
But if you really want
to do this,

03:40.208 --> 03:42.542
I can untie the knots
in those shoelaces.

03:42.625 --> 03:44.542
All right, maybe we just
wait to see

03:44.625 --> 03:47.333
what my wife's
egg production is.

03:47.417 --> 03:49.750
God willing, she's barren.

03:49.834 --> 03:51.458
(exhales)
Testicles.

03:51.542 --> 03:53.959
More like mess-ticles.

03:57.959 --> 03:59.208
Babe, hey! Guess what?

03:59.291 --> 04:00.709
My OB said

04:00.792 --> 04:03.333
I have the egg production
of a 20-year-old.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.834
She also complimented
my neck. Yes.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.500
(low-pitched):
Let's have a baby.

04:07.583 --> 04:09.917
Oh. We're having a baby.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.208
Yeah, another baby.

04:12.291 --> 04:14.125
Hmm?

04:14.208 --> 04:15.834
You okay? You look like
you're gonna throw up.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.458
JOAN:
<i>Hello, you have reached</i>

04:23.542 --> 04:25.208
Joan Short.

04:25.291 --> 04:28.667
This is not Chicken George's
Chicken and Fried Chicken.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.208
There was a misprint
on his takeout menu,

04:31.291 --> 04:32.875
-so please don't place an order.
-(door closes)

04:32.959 --> 04:34.041
MATT:
Hi, Mom.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.709
We were wondering
if you would like

04:36.792 --> 04:38.959
to watch Lucas for the evening.

04:39.041 --> 04:40.625
Take your time.
But our Uber's out front,

04:40.709 --> 04:42.250
-so we need your answer
pretty quick.

04:40.709 --> 04:42.250
-Yeah.

04:42.333 --> 04:43.500
GREG:
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

04:43.583 --> 04:44.917
whoa, whoa,
what is going on here?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.041
Oh, Joan has graciously agreed

04:47.125 --> 04:48.875
-to babysit Lucas tonight.
-I have?

04:48.959 --> 04:50.250
But she's watching
our kids tonight.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.375
-I am?
-MATT: Yeah,

04:51.458 --> 04:53.125
but you guys have had Mom
all to yourself

04:53.208 --> 04:55.083
for years. Don't you think
it's time to share?

04:55.166 --> 04:56.291
Well, I mean, it's not our fault

04:56.375 --> 04:57.625
it took you guys
so long to have kids.

04:57.709 --> 04:58.875
Fun point.

04:58.959 --> 05:01.041
Oh, please, kids, don't do that.

05:01.125 --> 05:02.500
She's right.
All right?

05:02.583 --> 05:04.417
We shouldn't make
Mom-Mom have to choose

05:04.500 --> 05:07.083
when she'd love to babysit
all of the grandkids.

05:07.166 --> 05:08.291
MATT:
That's a great point, Greg.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.125
Oh, and, uh, she just had
an eight-hour nap,

05:10.208 --> 05:11.917
so good luck getting her down.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.875
COLLEEN:
Oh, and one more thing.

05:13.959 --> 05:15.291
Lucas has a ton of allergies.

05:15.375 --> 05:16.625
So if you figure
out what they are,

05:16.709 --> 05:18.542
please let us know.
Thank you.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.417
Bye.

05:22.959 --> 05:25.834
(Talia crying)

05:28.875 --> 05:30.417
I thought we were going
to the theater.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.208
-(gasps)
-We have tickets

05:32.291 --> 05:35.291
to Jim Danvers
and his Singin' Dogs tonight.

05:35.375 --> 05:36.917
Oh, honey, what can I do?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.875
I can't say no to the kids.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.417
Am I speaking Mandarin here?

05:40.500 --> 05:43.583
It's Jim Danvers
and his Singin' Dogs.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.083
I know, it's-it's almost

05:45.166 --> 05:47.208
one of my favorite nights
of the year, too.

05:47.291 --> 05:48.750
Nobody's happy about this.

05:48.834 --> 05:51.458
And I need help.
And I tag you in.

05:51.542 --> 05:53.166
-Pass.
-No.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.917
You can't pass.

05:55.041 --> 05:58.375
I didn't sign up
for this babysitting nonsense.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.542
This is what grandparents do.

06:00.625 --> 06:03.125
Now please put on a pot
of coffee.

06:03.208 --> 06:05.583
Coffee at 7:00?
But I won't be able

06:05.667 --> 06:07.542
to fall asleep
till at least 8:00.

06:07.625 --> 06:09.125
(exhales)

06:09.208 --> 06:11.166
Fine.
I'll have coffee.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.583
But it'll be mostly whiskey.

06:19.083 --> 06:21.000
Well, I hope you're happy.

06:21.083 --> 06:22.792
The reviews are in.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.166
"Danvers dazzles."

06:24.250 --> 06:26.291
We missed the show
of the century.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.500
I would have gone with you,
Pop-Pop.

06:28.583 --> 06:31.375
It's a singing dog show.
It's not for kids.

06:31.458 --> 06:34.542
Wait, why are they back?
They were just here.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.083
They went home
to sleep peacefully,

06:36.166 --> 06:38.875
and now that they're awake,
loud and incontinent,

06:38.959 --> 06:40.041
they're back.

06:40.125 --> 06:42.417
All right.
Well, good luck.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.333
-Sit your sweet self down.
-(door opens, closes)

06:45.417 --> 06:46.333
Hey, Mom.

06:46.417 --> 06:48.041
-Hi.
-Heard you could use some help,

06:48.125 --> 06:49.458
so I thought it might be nice

06:49.542 --> 06:51.083
for Sophia to try babysitting.

06:51.166 --> 06:54.166
That's wonderful.
Another pair of hands.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.333
Oh, but I can't touch anything.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.166
-I have pink eye.
-What?

06:58.250 --> 07:00.041
(laughing):
She doesn't have pink eye.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.583
That's crazy.

07:01.667 --> 07:03.959
But just in case,
I have these drops for her.

07:04.041 --> 07:05.750
Every two to four hours.

07:05.834 --> 07:07.041
-So, I'll give you those. Okay.
-Hmm-mm.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.458
Love you.

07:08.542 --> 07:10.834
So, what's for dinner?

07:10.917 --> 07:12.291
Pop-Pop wants stroganoff.

07:12.375 --> 07:13.417
Oh, I'll have that.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.333
But, um, hold the stroganoff

07:15.417 --> 07:18.542
and add a side of...
anything else.

07:18.625 --> 07:20.375
Oh, that sounds good.

07:20.458 --> 07:21.917
I'll have that, too.

07:23.709 --> 07:28.041
(scoffs) My mom always
made me feel ignored...

07:28.125 --> 07:29.959
(snoring lightly)

07:30.041 --> 07:32.500
-Joan?
-Oh.

07:32.583 --> 07:33.875
Were you sleeping?

07:33.959 --> 07:35.125
(stammers)

07:35.208 --> 07:37.458
Deep, deep concentration.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.583
You can pick up
right where you left off.

07:39.667 --> 07:40.875
Okay, um...

07:40.959 --> 07:43.375
Or maybe we could go back
a few sentences.

07:43.458 --> 07:44.750
Okay, um...

07:44.834 --> 07:46.667
Lark, what are you doing here?

07:46.750 --> 07:49.500
Daddy said this
is Mom-Mom's playroom

07:49.583 --> 07:51.500
and then he left for Costco.

07:51.583 --> 07:53.709
Oh, mercy.
Uh, I'm so sorry.

07:53.792 --> 07:55.959
Le-Let me just
get my husband here

07:56.041 --> 07:58.375
and he'll, uh... John!

07:58.458 --> 08:00.834
My eye is crunchy.

08:00.917 --> 08:02.917
So, uh, forgive me.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.583
What were you saying, please?

08:04.667 --> 08:07.792
-I said I was feeling ignored...
-Lark!

08:07.875 --> 08:09.625
Don't... don't do that, dear.

08:09.709 --> 08:11.917
That... Oh.
Well, that's garbage now.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.208
I'm so sorry.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.083
You-you were saying.

08:15.166 --> 08:17.792
-I feel ignored...
-Lark!

08:17.875 --> 08:20.542
Lark, don't do that, darling.

08:22.166 --> 08:23.709
I just lost a patient.

08:23.792 --> 08:25.875
Who was he and how'd he do it?

08:25.959 --> 08:29.291
-Oh, no, I mean
a patient left me.

08:25.959 --> 08:29.291
-Oh.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.458
You know, being
a built-in babysitter

08:31.542 --> 08:34.083
is just ruining what I do.

08:34.166 --> 08:36.917
I thought you said babysitting
the kids <i>is </i>what you do.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.625
No, that was before
they killed my career.

08:39.709 --> 08:41.542
Well, they're killing mine, too.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.083
I mean, how can I be retired

08:43.166 --> 08:44.709
with all these kids
running around?

08:44.792 --> 08:46.250
Yeah, they're running over us.

08:46.333 --> 08:47.834
We have to put a stop to this.

08:47.917 --> 08:50.417
-(door opens)
-MATT: Hey, Mom?

08:50.500 --> 08:52.333
Now's your chance.

08:52.417 --> 08:54.041
Tell him you have your own life.

08:54.125 --> 08:55.458
I will.
And I might even

08:55.542 --> 08:58.083
poke my finger in his chest.

08:58.166 --> 08:59.500
Use the crooked one, huh?

08:59.583 --> 09:01.250
It always freaks him out.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.208
We believe in you.

09:04.291 --> 09:07.125
Yeah, your mom's
a strong lady, Tank.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.375
Except when
it comes to grandkids.

09:13.625 --> 09:15.542
Well, how long we got him for?

09:15.625 --> 09:17.750
They didn't say,
but they had luggage.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.750
Well, I'll put on
a pot of whiskey.

09:19.834 --> 09:22.959
Oh, on second thought,
uh, I'll hold Tank.

09:23.041 --> 09:25.375
That right eye of yours
is pink as bubble gum.

09:25.458 --> 09:27.917
-Oh, no. Oh, no.
-Yeah.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.125
Oh, honey,
we have to wash your hands.

09:30.208 --> 09:32.250
I don't believe it.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.500
All right, let's go.

09:38.583 --> 09:40.375
All right, now, remember,
Lark-- we're playing

09:40.458 --> 09:42.125
a really fun game, right?

09:42.208 --> 09:44.291
And if anyone asks,
you live here.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.625
-But this is Mom-Mom
and Pop-Pop's house.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.625
-Okay, well,

09:46.709 --> 09:48.208
if you're not gonna
play the game right,

09:48.291 --> 09:50.500
-then just don't talk.
-All right, come on.

09:48.291 --> 09:50.500
Pick it up. Come on.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.041
-And we're off.
-All right, come on.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.875
No.
No, no, no, no.

09:53.959 --> 09:56.000
I can't take your chicken order.

09:56.083 --> 09:58.834
If you call back and listen
to the voice message,

09:58.917 --> 10:00.709
it will explain everything.

10:00.792 --> 10:02.709
Hi. Oh.

10:02.792 --> 10:05.375
Oh, what a wonderful surprise.
Am I babysitting?

10:05.458 --> 10:07.417
No, but you are pretending that
this is our house. We had to

10:07.500 --> 10:10.083
use your address to get Lark
into the good school district.

10:10.166 --> 10:11.917
Yeah, and we heard Principal
Moore's making surprise

10:12.000 --> 10:13.917
house checks today.
So it's gonna be a bloodbath.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.458
I got it.
I got it.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.875
Okay.
Let's do this.

10:17.959 --> 10:20.000
Okay. Lark, honey,
I want you to take

10:20.083 --> 10:22.500
your toys, and I want you
to just throw 'em all over

10:22.583 --> 10:24.792
-the house, okay?
-But I'm gonna get a time-out.

10:24.875 --> 10:28.041
-Not today, you won't.
-I'm so confused.

10:28.125 --> 10:30.041
Okay, look, gaming
the system is confusing, okay?

10:30.125 --> 10:32.208
But if you want
to have an art class,

10:32.291 --> 10:33.792
you're gonna do it, little lady.

10:33.875 --> 10:37.417
When you bribe a child,
the reward has to be immediate.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.792
Have a soft calcium chew.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.417
I'm into this ruse.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.792
Okay, no time to explain.

10:45.875 --> 10:47.291
There's a woman coming
from the school,

10:47.375 --> 10:48.875
and we need to con her
into thinking

10:48.959 --> 10:50.375
that we actually live here,
so just go with it.

10:50.458 --> 10:52.750
No problem,
but do you think that woman

10:52.834 --> 10:55.542
from the school is gonna
want to talk to this one?

10:57.166 --> 10:59.625
Principal Moore.
Hello.

10:59.709 --> 11:01.792
We live here.

11:01.875 --> 11:03.500
I'm visiting from Tulsa.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.542
Soft calcium chew?

11:05.625 --> 11:07.166
Is that a bribe?

11:09.041 --> 11:11.875
Lark, that's a time-out.

11:11.959 --> 11:13.458
Holy crap.

11:13.542 --> 11:16.375
Private schools
cost over 30 grand a year?

11:16.458 --> 11:19.083
Wow. For 30 grand,
I can get a horimono.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.125
-A what?
-Horimono.

11:21.208 --> 11:23.917
It's a traditional Japanese
full-body tattoo,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.625
typically of dragons,
koi fish, Hello Kitty.

11:27.709 --> 11:30.625
Cool. Well, your new girlfriend
should love that.

11:30.709 --> 11:32.917
What about homeschool? I mean,
we could teach 'em, right?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.333
Uh-huh, okay, yeah, sure.

11:34.417 --> 11:36.792
Uh, which one of us
is going to quit our jobs

11:36.875 --> 11:38.375
and stay home all day, every day

11:38.458 --> 11:40.208
with the kids
and never get a break?

11:40.291 --> 11:41.959
You?

11:42.959 --> 11:44.792
Or-or me,
or we could buy a teacher.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.458
-I mean, how much do those
cost, legally speaking?

11:44.875 --> 11:47.458
-Okay.

11:47.542 --> 11:49.417
What if we just looked
for a house

11:49.500 --> 11:51.125
in the good school district?

11:51.208 --> 11:53.959
You know, like when you do
the math, it's gonna be cheaper

11:54.041 --> 11:57.792
than putting two kids
through private school.

11:57.875 --> 11:59.417
Are you doing the math?

11:59.500 --> 12:01.667
I want to get a peacock
for my horimono

12:01.750 --> 12:04.041
so that the feathers
can fan out over my abs

12:04.125 --> 12:07.208
onto my chest and all
the way up to my neck.

12:08.959 --> 12:11.333
Okay, let's go over the pros.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.875
It's in a great school district,
it's in our price range,

12:13.959 --> 12:16.458
-and there's room
for me to brew my beer.

12:13.959 --> 12:16.458
-Okay.

12:16.542 --> 12:18.583
Okay. Cons. Uh, it
needs a total renovation,

12:18.667 --> 12:20.166
the bedrooms are tiny,

12:20.250 --> 12:22.250
and there's space for
you to brew your beer.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.959
So what do we think?

12:25.041 --> 12:26.834
Great bones.

12:26.917 --> 12:29.291
Nobody is disputing that,
but, uh, unfortunately,

12:29.375 --> 12:31.000
it's not going to work for us

12:31.083 --> 12:32.959
due to the fact
that it's terrible.

12:33.041 --> 12:34.667
Well, I-I do have something

12:34.750 --> 12:37.166
that's not officially
on the market yet,

12:37.250 --> 12:39.583
but the owners
are entertaining offers.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.041
-Mm-hmm.
-Ooh, I like the idea of

12:39.667 --> 12:42.041
something that's forbidden.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.875
She likes a lot of things
that are forbidden.

12:43.959 --> 12:45.709
Greg, we just met this woman.

12:45.792 --> 12:47.250
REALTOR:
Now, the home is a bit out

12:47.333 --> 12:50.041
of your price range,
but it's the kind of place

12:50.125 --> 12:52.250
I can see
your family making memories.

12:53.917 --> 12:56.208
We already made memories here.

12:56.291 --> 12:58.291
Mom?!

13:01.083 --> 13:02.750
GREG:
Mom, Dad,

13:02.834 --> 13:05.000
how could you sell our house?

13:05.083 --> 13:07.208
Well, we were flirting
with single-floor living,

13:07.291 --> 13:09.333
and we decided to see
how much we'd get for it.

13:09.417 --> 13:12.625
And we can get a boatload,
so we're selling.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.583
Maybe buying a boat.

13:14.667 --> 13:17.250
Yeah, okay, but when were
you going to tell everybody?

13:17.333 --> 13:20.208
I mean, this house means
everything to us.

13:20.291 --> 13:21.750
What about the brunches?!

13:21.834 --> 13:23.333
First thing I thought of.

13:23.417 --> 13:25.375
What about the brunches?

13:25.458 --> 13:26.917
We didn't want
to discuss anything

13:27.000 --> 13:28.625
when there was nothing
to discuss.

13:28.709 --> 13:30.375
But then we got a ton of offers.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.041
It's so exhilarating!

13:32.125 --> 13:34.125
And they do it all
in cash nowadays.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.500
Briefcases full of cash.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.291
Pretty sure
that's not how it works.

13:38.375 --> 13:39.959
Plus, a couple told us

13:40.041 --> 13:42.542
this house is in the most
desirable school district.

13:42.625 --> 13:44.875
That was us.
We are that couple.

13:44.959 --> 13:46.333
I guess I just thought

13:46.417 --> 13:47.834
that this house would be
in the family forever.

13:47.917 --> 13:49.959
Well, maybe it could be.

13:50.041 --> 13:51.417
What do you think, John?

13:51.500 --> 13:53.375
Oh, nothing
would make us happier.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.542
But we'll need your offer in
by the end of business tomorrow.

13:56.625 --> 13:58.542
And no lowballing.

13:58.625 --> 14:01.166
We don't need to sell.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.291
Hi.

14:12.375 --> 14:14.208
Hey. Oh, uh,
your mom wants to know

14:14.291 --> 14:16.125
what kind of food you want
for your birthday party.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.250
Okay.

14:17.333 --> 14:18.834
What?
What is it?

14:18.917 --> 14:22.625
I heard back from Timehaus
about the job in Germany.

14:22.709 --> 14:24.375
-Wait, <i>the </i>job?
-Mm-hmm.

14:24.458 --> 14:25.625
Okay, w-what did they say?

14:25.709 --> 14:27.250
Okay, well, I ran the e-mail

14:27.333 --> 14:29.834
through the online
translator, and...

14:29.917 --> 14:31.792
"You are being the job.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.500
"Please take with us breakfast

14:33.583 --> 14:35.417
"on the Tuesday
subsequent to next.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.166
Cannot translate."

14:37.250 --> 14:38.417
The offer's real.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.375
(shrieks)
Oh, my God! Matt!

14:42.542 --> 14:44.166
You're gonna be the art director

14:44.250 --> 14:46.375
of the biggest watch company
in all of Europe.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.125
I am so proud of you.

14:48.208 --> 14:50.125
-Mm.
-Oh...

14:50.208 --> 14:51.709
(exhales)

14:51.792 --> 14:53.834
Are we really moving to Germany?

14:53.917 --> 14:55.417
I mean, is that crazy?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.750
Yes.
(laughs)

14:57.834 --> 14:59.333
Getting out of the country
is just what we need.

14:59.417 --> 15:02.375
What a relief to leave all this
credit card debt behind.

15:02.458 --> 15:04.166
-What?
-What?

15:05.291 --> 15:07.417
(Matt grunts)

15:07.500 --> 15:09.625
Oh, hey, honey?
Um, can we hold off

15:09.709 --> 15:11.417
on telling my family about
Germany until after the party?

15:11.500 --> 15:14.500
I mean, it's gonna be pretty
hard on my mom and dad.

15:14.583 --> 15:16.709
Mostly on my mom.

15:16.792 --> 15:17.959
Um... okay.

15:18.041 --> 15:19.208
Why'd you say it like that?

15:19.291 --> 15:22.041
Um... no reason.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.000
(accordion music plays)

15:25.083 --> 15:28.250
So why is your birthday
party German-themed?

15:28.333 --> 15:30.709
Mm. I wouldn't
really call it a theme.

15:30.792 --> 15:32.542
It's called Mattoberfest.

15:34.208 --> 15:37.208
Yeah, but it's pretty common

15:37.291 --> 15:39.875
to have a geographic theme
for a birthday party.

15:39.959 --> 15:41.333
I have never once heard of that.

15:41.417 --> 15:43.000
-No, it's a thing.
-I'm not sure...

15:43.083 --> 15:44.667
-It's definitely a thing,
Heather.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.667
-Okay, yeah.

15:44.750 --> 15:47.250
Why don't you just relax
and enjoy the perfectly normal,

15:47.333 --> 15:49.875
ordinary birthday
sauerkraut bar?

15:49.959 --> 15:51.834
Mm.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.333
-(phone rings)
-Hello.

15:53.417 --> 15:55.458
To Uncle Matt.
He's not just

15:55.542 --> 15:57.041
the world's best
brother-in-law...

15:57.125 --> 15:58.250
I'm sitting right here.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.583
...he's also the best uncle.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.250
I literally haven't moved.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.875
And he's gonna get
a chance to do it again,

16:02.959 --> 16:04.500
because we're having
another baby.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.667
-MATT: Get out!
-(overlapping excited chatter)

16:06.750 --> 16:08.625
-Oh, my.
-TIM: Which will happen

16:08.709 --> 16:10.417
just as soon as I can get
Heather pregnant,

16:10.500 --> 16:12.792
which will happen just as soon
as we can have sex again,

16:12.875 --> 16:15.417
which will happen
just as soon as I recover

16:15.500 --> 16:19.083
from my unimaginably painful
reverse vasectomy.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.375
To Uncle Matt.

16:20.458 --> 16:22.667
How wonderfully speculative.

16:22.750 --> 16:26.583
Yeah, you know, I'm-I'm two days
post-surgery, and I feel good.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.375
Well, congrats on
your future miracle.

16:28.458 --> 16:31.041
Oh, thank you.
(groans)

16:31.125 --> 16:33.166
We're a little bit older
than most new parents

16:33.250 --> 16:35.208
but thank God
we have free available help

16:35.291 --> 16:36.917
right across the street.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.458
I wouldn't count on that.

16:38.542 --> 16:39.834
Wait, what?
Is one of you dying?

16:39.917 --> 16:41.208
Oh, my God,
are both of you dying?

16:41.291 --> 16:43.041
Oh, no, honey, no.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.959
But we may be selling the house.

16:45.041 --> 16:46.625
MATT:
What?

16:46.709 --> 16:48.750
You can't sell
our childhood home.

16:48.834 --> 16:51.000
Oh, don't worry,
we're buying it.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.792
That's not any better.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.291
Calm down.
They only may be buying it.

16:55.375 --> 16:56.333
May be?

16:56.417 --> 16:58.458
Yeah, the offers
are very competitive.

16:58.542 --> 17:01.250
One of them wrote
a beautiful letter.

17:01.333 --> 17:04.417
Said this house reminded them
of the one they grew up in.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.667
This <i>is </i>the house we grew up in.

17:06.750 --> 17:07.667
MATT:
W-W-W-W-Wait.

17:07.750 --> 17:11.166
Why does Greg get to
buy our house but I don't?

17:11.250 --> 17:13.458
I can afford it now
with my new job.

17:13.542 --> 17:15.208
Wait, what?
What new job?

17:15.291 --> 17:18.417
I'm the new international
art director for Timehaus.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.333
-Matt, that is incredible.
-(others reacting)

17:21.417 --> 17:24.542
-(chuckles)
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

17:24.625 --> 17:25.875
Oh, it's wonderful.

17:25.959 --> 17:27.333
Yeah, well, I've been working
my whole life

17:27.417 --> 17:28.667
for a job like this.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.041
It's just, um...

17:30.125 --> 17:31.458
it's gonna be a long commute.

17:31.542 --> 17:33.917
-So? Just listen to a podcast.
-Yeah.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.125
It's in Germany.

17:36.208 --> 17:38.375
You're moving to Germany?

17:39.417 --> 17:42.500
Okay, these decorations
are such a coincidence.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.834
Uh... (clears throat)
Matt?

17:44.917 --> 17:47.458
-What's the matter, baby?
-That was our social worker.

17:47.542 --> 17:49.709
So it turns out we can't take
Lucas out of the country

17:49.792 --> 17:52.959
until the adoption papers
are finalized.

17:53.041 --> 17:55.959
-But that's, like.
six months from now.

17:53.041 --> 17:55.959
-Yeah.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.250
What do we do?

18:01.917 --> 18:03.125
Don't worry.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.917
-I'm sorry.
-No, hey.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.333
Uh, guys.
We're not going to Germany.

18:07.417 --> 18:08.375
-Oh.
-Oh.

18:08.458 --> 18:09.792
-It's just a job.
-(sighs)

18:09.875 --> 18:11.750
Oh, no.

18:11.834 --> 18:13.709
-I think I'm gonna sneeze,
somebody do something.

18:11.834 --> 18:13.709
-Okay.

18:13.792 --> 18:14.792
(Tim grunts)

18:14.875 --> 18:15.834
You got it.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.542
(sneezes)

18:17.625 --> 18:19.959
Oh.
(sneezes)

18:20.041 --> 18:21.875
(all groaning, muttering)

18:21.959 --> 18:24.041
-(sneezing continues)
-Uh-oh.

18:24.125 --> 18:25.542
-(overlapping groans)
-TYLER: Oh, no.

18:25.625 --> 18:26.792
Honey.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.417
TIM:
Oh, that did it.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.875
Oh, I'm spilling out.

18:34.792 --> 18:36.667
(sighs)
Finally got him down.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.125
He is so gonna wet that bed.

18:38.208 --> 18:39.500
He had, like, three
steins of juice.

18:39.583 --> 18:40.834
-(sighs)
-What?

18:40.917 --> 18:42.625
You have to take the job.

18:42.709 --> 18:44.375
Oh, honey, come on.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.291
No, no, no.
They said that we can't go.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.375
No, we can't.
But <i>you </i>can.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.291
-(sighs)
-You've waited your whole life

18:49.458 --> 18:51.291
to catch a break,

18:51.375 --> 18:54.625
and this is it. You can't let it
slip through your fingers.

18:54.709 --> 18:57.500
Are you crazy? Honey, I'm not
gonna leave you and Lucas.

18:57.583 --> 19:00.500
-It's six months.
-It's <i>only </i>six months, Matt.

19:00.583 --> 19:03.959
And think of the future
it could give us.

19:04.041 --> 19:06.458
We could pay for college
for Lucas, we could buy a house.

19:06.542 --> 19:08.375
-But, Colleen...
-We're gonna do it.

19:08.458 --> 19:09.917
We're just gonna figure it out.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.458
Together.
Like we always do.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.125
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

19:14.208 --> 19:15.709
I want you to get on that plane

19:15.792 --> 19:17.709
and I want you
to take that breakfast

19:17.792 --> 19:20.041
