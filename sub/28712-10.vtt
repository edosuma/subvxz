00:01.800 --> 00:03.630
NARRATOR:
Thousands of claims

00:03.760 --> 00:05.670
of alien abductions.

00:05.800 --> 00:08.340
NICK POPE:
People are reporting

00:08.470 --> 00:11.140
the extraterrestrials
are harvesting

00:11.260 --> 00:13.060
genetic material from humans.

00:13.180 --> 00:17.480
NARRATOR: Animals mutilated
with surgical precision.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.320
NICK REDFERN: What we know is
that something is harvesting

00:21.440 --> 00:24.690
body parts, blood and DNA.

00:24.820 --> 00:28.660
NARRATOR: Are aliens performing
genetic experimentation

00:28.780 --> 00:30.950
here on planet Earth?

00:31.080 --> 00:33.700
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
Other intelligences

00:33.830 --> 00:37.710
can mix and match
any gene they want

00:37.830 --> 00:40.830
and hybridize
and hybridize again.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.960
ERICH VON DANIKEN:
The question which remains is:

00:43.090 --> 00:48.340
If extraterrestrials have
made hybrids, why? What for?

00:48.470 --> 00:50.390
NARRATOR:
And if extraterrestrials

00:50.510 --> 00:54.270
are engaged in creating
alien-human hybrids,

00:54.390 --> 00:57.270
could it signal
the end of humankind?

00:57.390 --> 01:02.020
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Perhaps more
hybrids are being created right now

01:02.150 --> 01:06.740
in order to continue
this extraterrestrial evolution.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.660
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:11.780 --> 01:14.450
in the universe.

01:14.580 --> 01:17.410
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.170
It demands
we question everything

01:21.290 --> 01:23.460
we have ever been taught.

01:23.590 --> 01:27.300
The evidence is all around us.

01:27.420 --> 01:31.180
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.890
We are not alone.

01:34.010 --> 01:37.180
We have never <i>been</i> alone.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.570
NARRATOR:
Luzon island,

01:46.690 --> 01:49.570
the Philippines.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.360
2019.

01:52.490 --> 01:55.030
Archaeologists announce
the discovery

01:55.160 --> 01:58.200
of an entirely new relative
of the human species:

01:58.330 --> 02:01.120
Homo luzonensis.

02:01.250 --> 02:04.670
Found in a large limestone cave,

02:04.790 --> 02:09.840
the remains of Homo luzonensis
date back 67,000 years.

02:09.970 --> 02:13.090
Without a land bridge
to mainland Asia,

02:13.220 --> 02:16.100
this strange species
arose isolated

02:16.220 --> 02:19.640
from other hominin species.

02:19.770 --> 02:22.980
So I think when you look
at the evolution of humanity,

02:23.100 --> 02:26.520
and the different species that
have existed throughout time,

02:26.650 --> 02:28.730
early on, we had
a pretty simple story.

02:28.860 --> 02:31.900
We split from
chimpanzees and monkeys,

02:32.030 --> 02:34.780
the Homo sapien
ancestors developed,

02:34.910 --> 02:36.280
and you end up with Homo sapien,

02:36.410 --> 02:37.700
and we're the ones
that are left.

02:37.830 --> 02:41.250
As we do more research
in archeology,

02:41.370 --> 02:44.880
we're discovering a wide range
of different hominids.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.800
One of them
is the Homo luzonensis,

02:47.920 --> 02:49.670
and one of the interesting
things about it

02:49.800 --> 02:53.550
is the structures of some of the
bones are sufficiently different

02:53.680 --> 02:55.260
that it is a different species.

02:55.390 --> 02:58.560
NARRATOR:
In addition to Homo luzonensis,

02:58.680 --> 03:00.850
other ancient human-like species

03:00.970 --> 03:02.810
are continually
being discovered,

03:02.940 --> 03:06.440
like the Denisovans in Siberia

03:06.560 --> 03:11.320
and the hobbit-like
Homo floresiensis in Indonesia.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.860
Given the great diversity of
the number of different species,

03:15.990 --> 03:17.830
how is it that
Homo sapien sapien

03:17.950 --> 03:20.450
ended up the only one left?

03:20.580 --> 03:23.710
NARRATOR:
Although scientists now believe

03:23.830 --> 03:27.290
that at least eight human-like
species once walked the Earth,

03:27.420 --> 03:29.710
only Homo sapiens survived.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.960
But why?

03:32.090 --> 03:33.630
The answer remains

03:33.760 --> 03:37.140
one of archaeology's
greatest mysteries.

03:37.260 --> 03:41.390
Could it be possible that
this survival, or the reason why

03:41.520 --> 03:44.440
Homo sapiens has survived
to this day,

03:44.560 --> 03:49.690
is due to an extraterrestrial
interference?

03:49.820 --> 03:54.570
Are what we're looking at here
failed experiments, prototypes?

03:54.700 --> 03:57.160
Are we just
the latest experiment?

03:57.280 --> 03:59.910
Were there, previously,

04:00.030 --> 04:02.830
other branches
of the human family

04:02.950 --> 04:06.330
that were themselves
either created or enhanced,

04:06.460 --> 04:09.000
but which didn't quite
make the grade?

04:11.960 --> 04:15.050
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
extraterrestrial intervention

04:15.170 --> 04:18.010
could explain the existence
of multiple hominin species

04:18.140 --> 04:21.220
on Earth and the fact
that only Homo sapiens

04:21.350 --> 04:24.640
have survived
into the modern era?

04:24.770 --> 04:27.980
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that evidence

04:28.100 --> 04:30.860
to support this hypothesis
can be found

04:30.980 --> 04:35.110
in the historical records of the
earliest known civilizations,

04:35.240 --> 04:39.160
and, in particular, the Sumerian
stories of the Annunaki,

04:39.280 --> 04:43.450
also called
"the guardians of the sky."

04:43.580 --> 04:48.210
In the ancient Sumerian texts,
they talk about the Annunaki,

04:48.330 --> 04:53.210
who were described
as being able to fly,

04:53.340 --> 04:58.340
having elongated heads,
and also being very wise

04:58.470 --> 05:01.640
and bringing knowledge
and science.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.560
It's often said
that the Annunaki

05:04.680 --> 05:08.270
were specifically involved
in genetic experimentation.

05:08.390 --> 05:10.850
And so, here we have the story

05:10.980 --> 05:13.570
of extraterrestrials
genetically engineering people

05:13.690 --> 05:16.110
starting around 6,000 BC,

05:16.240 --> 05:19.200
although I suspect it must
go back much further than that.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.200
In order to keep
their territory,

05:22.320 --> 05:24.450
they made hybrids.

05:24.580 --> 05:28.830
They made hybrids that would
extend the Annunaki bloodline

05:28.960 --> 05:32.000
into standing-up primates

05:32.130 --> 05:34.960
that would carry out
their territory,

05:35.090 --> 05:36.960
their bloodline.

05:37.090 --> 05:39.680
What you can find
with many of these depictions

05:39.800 --> 05:41.220
of these ancient gods

05:41.340 --> 05:44.390
is they're described
either with wings

05:44.510 --> 05:48.680
or they're depicted
inside flying animals

05:48.810 --> 05:50.850
or flying machines.

05:50.980 --> 05:54.940
And whoever visited,
uh, ancient Sumeria,

05:55.070 --> 05:58.690
those same guys visited
elsewhere around the planet.

05:58.820 --> 06:02.610
Because, for example,
present-day Teotihuacan,

06:02.740 --> 06:06.160
there actually are statues
that have been found

06:06.290 --> 06:09.290
that are uncannily similar

06:09.410 --> 06:14.420
to statues that have been found
in present-day ancient Sumeria.

06:16.090 --> 06:18.050
NARRATOR:
Might species like Neanderthal

06:18.170 --> 06:20.800
and Homo luzonensis represent

06:20.920 --> 06:23.140
failed attempts
by alien visitors

06:23.260 --> 06:26.850
to create hybrids of themselves
from earthly primates?

06:26.970 --> 06:30.770
And could there have been
other even stranger creatures

06:30.890 --> 06:33.480
that resulted
from their experimentation?

06:36.110 --> 06:37.610
Mosul, Iraq.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.780
1845.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.160
While excavating
the ancient ruins

06:43.280 --> 06:45.490
of the Assyrian capital city
of Nimrud,

06:45.620 --> 06:49.080
famed English archeologist
Austen Henry Layard

06:49.200 --> 06:53.080
unearths an amazing stone
covered with detailed carvings.

06:53.210 --> 06:57.840
Dating to 825 BC,
the black limestone obelisk

06:57.960 --> 07:01.300
commemorates the deeds
of King Shalmaneser III.

07:01.420 --> 07:05.430
Curiously, depicted alongside
his military conquests

07:05.550 --> 07:07.600
and various offerings
made to him

07:07.720 --> 07:10.770
are strange hybrid creatures.

07:10.890 --> 07:13.940
The Black Obelisk
of Shalmaneser III

07:14.060 --> 07:16.650
is incredibly fascinating

07:16.770 --> 07:20.230
because, as far as hybrid beings
are concerned,

07:20.360 --> 07:25.360
what we have here are creatures
half-animal, half-human,

07:25.490 --> 07:31.120
some with a-a human head
with then an animal body.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.750
And what's so interesting

07:32.870 --> 07:37.040
is the fact that the artist
was very clear

07:37.170 --> 07:40.750
in depicting something and that
is that some of these creatures

07:40.880 --> 07:45.800
are held with a rope
and one even with a chain.

07:45.930 --> 07:48.140
Now, did these creatures

07:48.260 --> 07:51.430
actually walk around
here on Earth?

07:51.560 --> 07:54.060
And frankly,
I would not be surprised

07:54.180 --> 07:57.190
if that's what happened
because the basic tenet

07:57.310 --> 07:59.060
of the ancient astronaut theory

07:59.190 --> 08:03.860
is manipulation artificially
of genetic material.

08:03.990 --> 08:07.610
NARRATOR: Hybrid creatures
abound in mythological traditions

08:07.740 --> 08:09.370
all over the world,

08:09.490 --> 08:12.870
and in many cases,
they are part-human.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.410
The ancient Greeks
wrote about the centaur...

08:15.540 --> 08:18.080
Half-human, half-horse.

08:18.210 --> 08:21.880
In Hindu mythology,
the naga are often depicted

08:22.000 --> 08:24.800
as serpentine creatures
with human heads,

08:24.920 --> 08:27.590
while the Egyptian god Horus

08:27.720 --> 08:30.260
has a falcon head
and a human body.

08:30.390 --> 08:32.850
Even in the Quran,

08:32.970 --> 08:35.600
the flying horse that was said
to have flown Muhammad

08:35.730 --> 08:39.309
from Mecca to Jerusalem
had a human face.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.900
VON DANIKEN:
By natural evolution,

08:42.020 --> 08:44.360
hybrids can never have existed.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.400
If hybrids existed,

08:46.530 --> 08:49.910
then there must be
genetical design behind it.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.620
Our ancestor,
in Egypt or elsewhere,

08:52.740 --> 08:56.460
had no genetical designs,
but we had the hybrids.

08:56.580 --> 08:58.330
You can prove it
in the literature,

08:58.460 --> 09:00.170
you can prove it
in the sculptures,

09:00.290 --> 09:03.380
which still exist worldwide,
especially in Egypt.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.800
The question which remains is:

09:05.920 --> 09:10.470
If extraterrestrials have
made hybrids, why? What for?

09:12.550 --> 09:15.270
NARRATOR: Could the Black
Obelisk of Shalmaneser III

09:15.390 --> 09:18.140
and countless other depictions
around the world

09:18.270 --> 09:20.270
be a physical record

09:20.400 --> 09:23.480
that hybrids have existed
throughout history?

09:23.610 --> 09:28.450
And if so, is there
an alien hybridization project

09:28.570 --> 09:31.570
that continues to be carried out
even today?

09:31.700 --> 09:34.490
Perhaps further clues
can be found

09:34.620 --> 09:39.040
by examining the bizarre
and gruesome phenomenon

09:39.160 --> 09:41.000
of animal mutilation.

09:48.670 --> 09:51.260
NARRATOR:
Moscow, the Soviet Union.

09:51.380 --> 09:55.140
February, 1954.

09:55.260 --> 09:58.980
At the Institute of Experimental
Clinical Surgery,

09:59.100 --> 10:02.270
organ transplantation pioneer
Vladimir Demikhov

10:02.400 --> 10:05.110
conducts a potentially
groundbreaking

10:05.230 --> 10:08.400
and highly controversial
experiment.

10:08.530 --> 10:13.370
He transplants a dog's head
onto the torso of another dog

10:13.490 --> 10:17.080
using vascular connections
to the host dog's heart.

10:17.200 --> 10:22.210
The procedure is a success,
and over the next five years,

10:22.330 --> 10:26.000
Demikhov performs
several more head transplants.

10:26.130 --> 10:29.970
As far as these experiments
are concerned,

10:30.090 --> 10:34.760
what they demonstrated was that
scientists now had the potential

10:34.890 --> 10:37.470
to quite literally play God,

10:37.600 --> 10:42.520
by mixing human DNA
with animal DNA,

10:42.640 --> 10:45.560
creating, if you like,
sort of chimeras.

10:45.690 --> 10:48.320
NARRATOR: Looking back
at Demikhov's efforts

10:48.440 --> 10:50.530
more than 50 years later,

10:50.650 --> 10:53.610
they seem like the work
of a mad scientist.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.830
But surgeons today
have gone even further,

10:56.950 --> 11:00.870
actually merging animals
with humans.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.790
In 2003,
Chinese scientist Hui Zhen Sheng

11:05.920 --> 11:08.670
fused human cells
with rabbit eggs,

11:08.800 --> 11:11.840
resulting in the first
human-animal hybrids

11:11.970 --> 11:14.720
created through
genetic engineering.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.850
In 2004, researchers
at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic

11:18.970 --> 11:23.440
created pigs with human blood
flowing through their bodies.

11:23.560 --> 11:28.440
And in 2018,
Chinese scientist He Jiankui

11:28.570 --> 11:32.150
used a powerful new gene editing
technique called CRISPR

11:32.280 --> 11:36.320
to create the world's first
genetically-edited human babies,

11:36.450 --> 11:38.740
Lulu and Nana.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.460
DENNIN: It's basically
molecular scissors

11:43.580 --> 11:46.790
that also do a cut exactly
where you want to cut

11:46.920 --> 11:50.210
and puts the new pieces
that you want into the DNA.

11:50.340 --> 11:53.550
So, as we learn
how to map out DNA,

11:53.670 --> 11:55.550
as we learn
what the different genes are,

11:55.680 --> 11:57.720
we finally have the tool
that would allow us

11:57.840 --> 12:00.220
to design the genes
in certain ways.

12:00.350 --> 12:02.970
NARRATOR:
In recent years,

12:03.100 --> 12:06.140
some scientists have even
proposed that building upon

12:06.270 --> 12:08.980
Vladimir Demikhov's
experiments with dogs,

12:09.110 --> 12:13.400
transplants of human heads
may soon become a reality.

12:13.530 --> 12:16.530
But for ancient
astronaut theorists,

12:16.660 --> 12:21.530
all of these animal-human hybrid
experiments are nothing new.

12:21.660 --> 12:25.160
In fact, they are eerily
reminiscent of the depictions

12:25.290 --> 12:28.830
of hybrid creatures found
on numerous ancient carvings,

12:28.960 --> 12:32.920
like those on the Obelisk
of King Shalmaneser III,

12:33.050 --> 12:35.760
that seem to show stitches
around the necks

12:35.880 --> 12:39.050
of what appear to be
human-faced dogs.

12:41.510 --> 12:47.270
I sometimes wonder if what
we're doing now was also done

12:47.390 --> 12:50.560
tens and tens of thousands
of years ago,

12:50.690 --> 12:53.360
in different parts of the world,

12:53.480 --> 12:57.400
and possibly that could have
led to the creation

12:57.530 --> 13:00.660
of these multiple different
types of early humans.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.200
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the discovery

13:03.330 --> 13:06.870
of other human-like species
that once roamed the Earth,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.870
as well as ancient depictions
of hybrid creatures,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.210
provides evidence that,
thousands of years ago,

13:13.340 --> 13:16.380
extraterrestrials performed
genetic experiments

13:16.510 --> 13:20.550
similar to those being conducted
by scientists today?

13:20.680 --> 13:23.140
According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

13:23.260 --> 13:25.560
not only did this happen
in the past,

13:25.680 --> 13:27.930
but a disturbing phenomenon
suggests

13:28.060 --> 13:31.900
that what they refer to as
an alien hybridization project

13:32.020 --> 13:34.270
is still underway.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.650
San Luis Valley, Colorado.

13:40.610 --> 13:42.910
1967.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.870
On the King family ranch,

13:45.990 --> 13:50.250
a horse named Lady
is found dead in a pasture.

13:50.370 --> 13:53.750
The skull is stripped so clean
of flesh that it appears

13:53.880 --> 13:56.340
to have been exposed
to the elements for weeks.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.470
Yet the King family
had seen Lady alive

13:59.590 --> 14:01.590
just two days earlier.

14:01.720 --> 14:06.510
More astonishingly, no blood
or animal tracks of any kind

14:06.640 --> 14:08.850
are found near the corpse.

14:08.980 --> 14:12.440
Authorities are shaken
and perplexed.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.650
The skeleton was
completely clean and white.

14:16.780 --> 14:19.360
Even brain tissue was gone.

14:19.490 --> 14:24.450
But the rest of the horse looked
as if it should get up and walk.

14:24.570 --> 14:26.620
It was that fresh.

14:26.740 --> 14:31.080
NARRATOR: Lady has become
famous under the name "Snippy,"

14:31.210 --> 14:34.000
as early press coverage
misidentified the animal

14:34.130 --> 14:36.500
as the horse which sired her.

14:36.630 --> 14:39.010
But the incident likely
would have been lost

14:39.130 --> 14:42.050
to history completely
were it not for the fact

14:42.180 --> 14:45.050
that near-identical slaughters
soon became commonplace

14:45.180 --> 14:48.010
across the American heartland.

14:48.140 --> 14:51.430
You had farmers and ranchers
getting up in the morning

14:51.560 --> 14:55.190
and finding their animals dead
in the fields.

14:55.310 --> 14:58.900
And these were clearly not
attacks by mountain lions

14:59.030 --> 15:02.490
or coyotes
or anything like that.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.780
The farmers actually reported
how blood was drained

15:05.910 --> 15:08.830
from the animals,
organs were removed,

15:08.950 --> 15:13.460
and it seemed as if the bodies
of the cattle had been opened up

15:13.580 --> 15:17.540
by some sort of
high-heat weapon or device.

15:17.670 --> 15:21.340
NARRATOR: Animal mutilations
have continued to this day,

15:21.460 --> 15:23.470
and in many cases,

15:23.590 --> 15:26.300
ranchers report seeing
strange bright lights

15:26.430 --> 15:28.720
in the vicinity
of the butchered animal.

15:31.020 --> 15:33.690
HOWE: The deeper you get and
the more people you interview...

15:33.810 --> 15:36.940
And I have literally interviewed
thousands now...

15:37.060 --> 15:41.820
You hear,
"I saw this kind of light.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.740
"I saw this beam lowering
an animal to the pasture

15:44.860 --> 15:46.530
and it was mutilated."

15:46.660 --> 15:49.160
Somebody else,
"I saw this animal coming up

15:49.280 --> 15:53.120
in a beam of light, and later
it was found mutilated."

15:53.250 --> 15:57.210
REDFERN: What we know is
that something is harvesting

15:57.330 --> 16:01.880
body parts, blood, cells,
DNA from animals.

16:03.670 --> 16:05.550
NARRATOR:
If aliens are, in fact,

16:05.680 --> 16:08.090
harvesting genetic material
from the food chain,

16:08.220 --> 16:12.180
how does this tie in
with their agenda for humanity?

16:12.310 --> 16:15.520
Scientists have recently
discovered that humans

16:15.640 --> 16:18.610
are remarkably similar
to many other animals

16:18.730 --> 16:21.400
in terms of genetic makeup.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.280
Human beings share roughly 80%
of their genes with cows,

16:25.400 --> 16:29.280
85% with mice, 90% with cats,

16:29.410 --> 16:32.830
and 96% with chimpanzees.

16:32.950 --> 16:37.920
Considering the commonalities
in DNA, is it possible

16:38.040 --> 16:42.090
that if there really is an alien
hybridization project underway,

16:42.210 --> 16:46.220
its goal is not
to direct human evolution?

16:46.340 --> 16:49.720
Could it be that we are
just one of many species

16:49.840 --> 16:52.510
from which they are extracting
genetic material

16:52.640 --> 16:55.390
to create an entirely
new life-form?

16:56.600 --> 17:00.440
If you can genetically extract

17:00.560 --> 17:03.610
from any life-form

17:03.730 --> 17:06.530
and take those genes

17:06.650 --> 17:10.990
and hybridize
and hybridize again...

17:13.200 --> 17:18.160
We are the product
of the manipulation of DNA

17:18.290 --> 17:21.460
in already-evolving primates

17:21.579 --> 17:26.589
by other intelligences
that can mix and match any gene

17:26.710 --> 17:29.880
they want for any purpose.

17:31.470 --> 17:33.640
What are their motivations?

17:33.760 --> 17:37.180
Now, so far, at least,
they haven't destroyed us.

17:37.310 --> 17:42.230
But in saying that, I haven't
really seen much in the way

17:42.360 --> 17:47.570
of positive activity on their
part to help us as a species.

17:49.030 --> 17:51.740
I think they're probably
self-serving,

17:51.860 --> 17:57.580
and that self-serving situation
may well involve the creation

17:57.700 --> 18:01.080
of an extremely
complex experiment,

18:01.210 --> 18:04.000
and that experiment
happens to be us.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.840
NARRATOR: Are extraterrestrials
extracting DNA

18:08.970 --> 18:11.630
from all manner
of earthly species

18:11.760 --> 18:15.430
in an effort to create
so-called alien-human hybrids?

18:15.560 --> 18:19.140
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

18:19.270 --> 18:21.850
and suggest further evidence
can be found

18:21.980 --> 18:25.860
by closely examining some
of the stories told concerning

18:25.980 --> 18:27.730
alien abductions.

18:33.620 --> 18:35.740
NARRATOR:
Boston, Massachusetts.

18:35.870 --> 18:39.870
October 25, 1965.

18:41.790 --> 18:44.580
A local newspaper known
as the <i>Boston Traveler</i>

18:44.710 --> 18:46.460
runs a front-page story

18:46.590 --> 18:48.920
about the alleged
alien abduction

18:49.050 --> 18:52.760
of New Hampshire residents
Betty and Barney Hill.

18:52.880 --> 18:57.640
In the more than five decades
since this now-famous incident,

18:57.760 --> 19:01.140
thousands of others have come
forward with similar reports

19:01.270 --> 19:06.230
of being abducted
by extraterrestrials.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.780
What's particularly notable
is the fact

19:08.900 --> 19:12.950
that during alien abductions,
people talk about

19:13.070 --> 19:18.870
DNA taken from their bodies
and essentially experimented on

19:18.990 --> 19:22.580
by these strange, short,
black-eyed entities

19:22.710 --> 19:24.790
that have become known
as the Greys.

19:28.380 --> 19:32.920
NARRATOR: As far as ancient
astronaut theorists are concerned,

19:33.050 --> 19:36.890
an equally chilling aspect of
these reported alien abductions

19:37.010 --> 19:40.100
is the role that human blood
and blood type

19:40.220 --> 19:44.350
seems to play in determining
which human subjects

19:44.480 --> 19:48.060
become the targets
of experimentation.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.440
NARRATOR:
New York, New York.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.150
1940.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.910
At the Rockefeller Institute,

19:58.030 --> 20:01.290
Nobel Prize-winning scientist
Karl Landsteiner

20:01.410 --> 20:03.540
makes yet another
groundbreaking finding

20:03.660 --> 20:06.920
in his work surrounding
human blood types.

20:08.420 --> 20:11.550
Landsteiner discovers
the Rh factor,

20:11.670 --> 20:14.590
a type of protein, or antigen,

20:14.720 --> 20:16.800
on the surface
of red blood cells,

20:16.930 --> 20:20.350
setting the scientific world
afire.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.180
DENNIN:
One of the things about

20:24.310 --> 20:26.890
human blood types
is we have an Rh,

20:27.020 --> 20:28.810
either positive or negative
blood type.

20:28.940 --> 20:32.780
And it simply has to do
with a particular antibody

20:32.900 --> 20:35.030
on the outside
of our red blood cells.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.450
If you have it, you're positive,

20:36.570 --> 20:38.410
and if you don't,
you're negative.

20:38.530 --> 20:41.780
NARRATOR: Landsteiner was
the first person to identify

20:41.910 --> 20:45.500
the original A, B and O
blood groups.

20:45.620 --> 20:50.000
But his latest discovery ignites
a much more fascinating mystery

20:50.130 --> 20:53.460
underlying the nature
of human blood.

20:53.590 --> 20:56.340
REDFERN: One of the
most intriguing aspects

20:56.470 --> 21:01.470
of the Rh negative
versus Rh positive

21:01.600 --> 21:06.230
is that science
really does not have

21:06.350 --> 21:10.480
a specific answer as to why
some people should be negative

21:10.610 --> 21:13.320
and why other people
should be positive.

21:15.820 --> 21:18.910
DENNIN: Just like any virus
or bacteria or disease,

21:19.030 --> 21:22.830
if you mix these blood types,
you can get interesting effects.

21:22.950 --> 21:27.540
If you're Rh negative
and you get Rh positive blood,

21:27.660 --> 21:29.670
the red blood cells
look different.

21:29.790 --> 21:32.380
They look like an invading
bacteria or virus,

21:32.500 --> 21:34.670
and your immune system
will react to that,

21:34.800 --> 21:37.300
and that can lead to
various diseases and problems.

21:37.420 --> 21:39.260
(monitor beeping steadily)

21:39.380 --> 21:43.430
REDFERN: When you're in a situation
where you have a pregnant woman

21:43.550 --> 21:47.730
who is Rh negative
and the father is Rh positive,

21:47.850 --> 21:51.650
what we find is
that the pregnant woman's

21:51.770 --> 21:55.690
immune system quite literally
views the growing fetus

21:55.820 --> 21:58.990
as something alien,
no pun intended.

21:59.110 --> 22:03.240
In that situation,
medicine is provided

22:03.370 --> 22:06.200
to ensure that the fetus
grows healthy.

22:08.450 --> 22:10.960
NARRATOR: How and why the Rh
negative blood type developed

22:11.080 --> 22:13.210
remains a mystery to scientists.

22:13.330 --> 22:15.750
And while
the blood type is rare,

22:15.880 --> 22:18.550
there appears to be
a disproportionately

22:18.670 --> 22:20.880
high occurrence
of Rh negative individuals

22:21.010 --> 22:23.890
among one particular
group of people:

22:24.010 --> 22:27.890
Those who claim to have been
abducted by aliens.

22:28.020 --> 22:30.940
HOWE:
I don't think anybody

22:31.060 --> 22:33.150
would be able
to stand behind a number

22:33.270 --> 22:36.150
and firmly know, but...

22:36.270 --> 22:38.360
maybe three,

22:38.480 --> 22:42.450
maybe even some four
out of ten people

22:42.570 --> 22:45.410
that you would interview
in the abduction syndrome

22:45.530 --> 22:48.120
would say, "I'm Rh negative."

22:48.240 --> 22:52.370
NARRATOR: Could determining the
origin of Rh negative humans

22:52.500 --> 22:55.380
be the key to uncovering
the mystery behind

22:55.500 --> 22:58.130
potential human-alien hybrids?

22:58.250 --> 23:02.050
Is it possible that a link
to an ancient history

23:02.170 --> 23:04.550
of Rh negative people
could be found

23:04.680 --> 23:07.260
in a modern-day
population of humans?

23:11.020 --> 23:14.150
Basque Country, Northern Spain.

23:14.270 --> 23:18.150
Wedged between the mountains
and the shore,

23:18.270 --> 23:21.820
this isolated and unique culture
near the border with France

23:21.940 --> 23:25.950
contains a genetic heritage
rare in most of the world.

23:26.070 --> 23:29.410
The Basque people
have the highest concentration

23:29.540 --> 23:32.580
of Rh negative blood on Earth.

23:32.710 --> 23:36.630
What's particularly fascinating
about the Basque people

23:36.750 --> 23:40.170
is their huge percentages
of Rh negatives

23:40.300 --> 23:41.800
in their populations.

23:44.130 --> 23:49.180
Typically, it's above 50%
in the entire Basque population.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.980
What's particularly notable
is that,

23:54.100 --> 23:57.060
in the rest of the planet,
across the world,

23:57.190 --> 24:00.980
the figures are actually
only about two to three percent.

24:01.110 --> 24:04.860
And because we know
that ancient man

24:04.990 --> 24:08.620
roamed around those same areas
of-of Spain and France

24:08.740 --> 24:11.410
thousands and thousands
of years ago,

24:11.540 --> 24:14.160
this has given rise
to the potential theory

24:14.290 --> 24:18.000
that the early humans
were also Rh negatives.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.050
NARRATOR: While it is
unclear exactly what role

24:24.170 --> 24:27.050
the Rh negative blood type
plays in what many believe

24:27.180 --> 24:31.220
to be an ongoing
alien hybridization project,

24:31.350 --> 24:34.270
there are some who are certain
that the ultimate goal

24:34.390 --> 24:36.520
is to alter the human race.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.940
But why?

24:39.060 --> 24:43.030
As far as they are concerned,
the answer is clear,

24:43.150 --> 24:47.030
because they claim
that they themselves...

24:47.150 --> 24:48.860
are hybrids.

24:53.790 --> 24:55.910
NARRATOR:
Baltimore, Maryland.

24:56.040 --> 24:59.920
November 9, 2018.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.670
Thousands gather at
the Baltimore Convention Center

25:05.800 --> 25:08.880
for AlienCon, a three-day event

25:09.010 --> 25:11.550
dedicated to exploring
the possibility

25:11.680 --> 25:14.270
that life not only exists
on other planets,

25:14.390 --> 25:17.770
but that intelligent beings
have been visiting the Earth

25:17.890 --> 25:19.690
for thousands of years.

25:19.810 --> 25:24.860
I would like to ask
this audience at this AlienCon:

25:24.980 --> 25:26.900
How many of you

25:27.030 --> 25:31.070
have had missing time,
an abduction experience,

25:31.200 --> 25:34.950
have encountered perhaps
an entity in your room,

25:35.080 --> 25:38.370
or you have seen
some kind of lights,

25:38.500 --> 25:41.580
craft that have left you
with the feeling

25:41.710 --> 25:44.750
that you were seeing
or experiencing something

25:44.880 --> 25:47.300
that was not human
and fits into this category?

25:47.420 --> 25:50.470
- How many?
- Wow.

25:50.590 --> 25:54.310
That-that is... wow, that is
an impressive show of hands.

25:54.430 --> 25:56.520
That's staggering.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.350
NARRATOR:
The large numbers

25:58.480 --> 26:03.560
of allegedly abducted people
in the audience stuns the panel.

26:03.690 --> 26:07.150
Equally impressive is
the credibility of the stories.

26:07.280 --> 26:10.030
Let me just say
I'm a very logical person.

26:10.150 --> 26:12.910
He looked at me, he tipped
his head down, and he looked up.

26:13.030 --> 26:16.620
At that moment,
his eyes went black,

26:16.740 --> 26:20.080
his nose started to turn
almost beak-like,

26:20.210 --> 26:23.290
and I couldn't break the gaze.

26:23.420 --> 26:26.550
I've had beings
walk through the wall.

26:26.670 --> 26:29.130
Um, I'm Rh negative, green-eyed.

26:29.260 --> 26:31.180
I do have some missing time.

26:31.300 --> 26:35.550
We wake up, and we're not
in our bedroom anymore.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.720
We're laying on tables.

26:37.850 --> 26:39.560
They pulled me up on the ship.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.640
They did surgery on me.

26:41.770 --> 26:44.810
I had no idea
what they were doing.

26:44.940 --> 26:49.110
I later found, may have been
extracting sperm.

26:51.530 --> 26:54.070
NARRATOR: But if alien
abductions are really happening,

26:54.200 --> 26:56.030
what is their purpose?

26:56.160 --> 27:00.540
Are extraterrestrials simply
examining the human species,

27:00.660 --> 27:04.880
or is there another
even more profound agenda?

27:05.000 --> 27:08.250
The reptilian who visits me
on a regular basis...

27:08.380 --> 27:12.300
Apparently he realized I was
infertile, and he backed away.

27:12.420 --> 27:16.300
As I began to do
more and more deep research,

27:16.430 --> 27:19.890
eventually you come out
at another layer.

27:20.020 --> 27:21.890
What are we?

27:22.020 --> 27:25.190
What are
Homo sapien sapien really?

27:25.310 --> 27:29.570
And then you get
to my perspective today:

27:29.690 --> 27:33.860
The harvest of genetic material
from this planet.

27:33.990 --> 27:36.660
And so one of
our greatest questions is:

27:36.780 --> 27:39.200
Who walks around on our planet,

27:39.330 --> 27:43.160
looks human... but is not?

27:45.500 --> 27:47.330
NARRATOR:
Could human abductions be part

27:47.460 --> 27:49.880
of a greater effort
by extraterrestrials

27:50.000 --> 27:54.180
to hybridize the human species
with alien DNA?

27:54.300 --> 27:57.640
Many ancient astronaut
theorists insist

27:57.760 --> 28:00.850
that such an audacious notion
is not only likely,

28:00.970 --> 28:03.520
but that evidence of it
can be documented

28:03.640 --> 28:05.900
by means of regression therapy.

28:10.400 --> 28:13.570
Barbara Lamb has conducted
nearly 2,000 regressions

28:13.690 --> 28:17.320
on people who believe
they have been abducted

28:17.450 --> 28:19.910
by extraterrestrial beings.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.910
Most recently,
she has been studying the case

28:25.040 --> 28:27.330
of California native
Robert Fullington,

28:27.460 --> 28:29.040
who has, under hypnosis,

28:29.170 --> 28:31.500
revealed details
of his numerous encounters

28:31.630 --> 28:33.260
with extraterrestrials

28:33.380 --> 28:36.380
over the course
of the past ten years.

28:36.510 --> 28:40.050
I came to know hybrids
several years ago,

28:40.180 --> 28:41.930
and since then,

28:42.060 --> 28:45.680
I've been conducting
long, long interviews,

28:45.810 --> 28:47.690
and have been doing regressions
with them.

28:47.810 --> 28:50.440
And out of all that material,

28:50.560 --> 28:53.900
I have become convinced
that they are indeed

28:54.030 --> 28:58.070
ET-human hybrids
living here on Earth.

28:59.620 --> 29:02.080
ROBERT FULLINGTON:
I was 215 pounds,

29:02.200 --> 29:06.040
and I went down to 115 pounds.

29:06.160 --> 29:09.170
And doctors had no idea
what was going on with me.

29:09.290 --> 29:12.420
I was starting
to have experience with ETs.

29:12.540 --> 29:15.300
It's things like going to sleep

29:15.420 --> 29:18.380
and then becoming aware
that something's happening.

29:18.510 --> 29:24.680
It's these little tiny blips
of real clear ET interactions.

29:24.810 --> 29:27.310
And I have
no idea what's going on.

29:29.270 --> 29:30.810
LAMB:
A wonderful thing

29:30.940 --> 29:34.480
is that our subconscious
part of our minds

29:34.610 --> 29:38.240
records everything
that happens to us,

29:38.360 --> 29:40.280
even those things that

29:40.410 --> 29:43.370
we have not been
consciously aware of.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.700
Hi.

29:45.830 --> 29:50.500
NARRATOR: On June 6,
2019, Barbara conducted

29:50.620 --> 29:52.130
another regression session
with Robert...

29:52.250 --> 29:54.630
- Okay, nice and comfortable now?
- Mm-hmm.

29:54.750 --> 29:57.510
NARRATOR: In an effort to find out
not only why he had been abducted,

29:57.630 --> 30:00.380
but also the specific way
in which he might have been

30:00.510 --> 30:02.010
genetically altered.

30:02.140 --> 30:04.890
So now we're going to go
into a nice state

30:05.010 --> 30:06.600
of deep relaxation.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.190
More and more deep.

30:12.730 --> 30:14.110
More and more relaxed.

30:19.860 --> 30:23.320
People are, uh, laying in lines,
and they're working on people.

30:23.450 --> 30:26.490
Like, I'm last in line
to be worked on.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.580
Now, are these people in line,

30:28.700 --> 30:31.000
- are they lying down or are they...
- Yeah. They're...

30:31.120 --> 30:33.460
It's like a bunch of tables
in a row.

30:33.580 --> 30:37.300
I feel like there's something
inserting into my stomach.

30:37.420 --> 30:39.550
They're extracting something.

30:39.670 --> 30:42.430
Like they're collecting DNA
from different people.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.560
LAMB: In the regression,
it turned out that

30:46.680 --> 30:52.100
one extraterrestrial
actually made an incision

30:52.230 --> 30:55.190
and took out DNA.

30:55.310 --> 31:00.070
Now, that is something that has
come across through my work.

31:00.190 --> 31:03.240
Some of them seem to be
very scientific,

31:03.360 --> 31:06.660
and they want to understand
how human bodies work

31:06.780 --> 31:09.750
and what our physiology is like.

31:09.870 --> 31:12.160
In many of the regressions
I have done,

31:12.290 --> 31:14.750
it turns out that the ETs

31:14.880 --> 31:19.170
are creating hybrids
for their own purposes.

31:22.340 --> 31:25.470
NARRATOR: If extraterrestrials
are extracting genetic material

31:25.590 --> 31:29.520
from humans and experimenting
with alien-human hybrids,

31:29.640 --> 31:31.350
what might their purpose be?

31:31.480 --> 31:34.190
Is it to benefit the aliens,

31:34.310 --> 31:38.070
humanity, or could it be...

31:38.190 --> 31:39.900
both?

31:44.570 --> 31:47.780
NARRATOR:
Berkeley, California.

31:47.910 --> 31:50.540
2013.

31:50.660 --> 31:54.420
An international team of
anthropologists and geneticists

31:54.540 --> 32:00.250
at UC Berkeley discover
that between 1.5 and 2.1 percent

32:00.380 --> 32:02.880
of the genomes
of modern non-Africans

32:03.010 --> 32:07.340
can be traced to a hominin
that lived alongside humans:

32:07.470 --> 32:09.180
Neanderthals.

32:11.310 --> 32:13.980
The finding provides proof
that early humans

32:14.100 --> 32:16.480
came into contact
with Neanderthals,

32:16.600 --> 32:19.190
and even interbred with them.

32:19.310 --> 32:22.690
But one thing scientists are
still unable to explain

32:22.820 --> 32:26.070
is why humans survived,
and Neanderthals,

32:26.200 --> 32:31.540
who were in many ways
a superior species, did not.

32:31.660 --> 32:35.040
One of the biggest mysteries
about Neanderthal man

32:35.160 --> 32:38.750
is how and why
they became extinct.

32:38.880 --> 32:42.880
They were very strong,
robust, intelligent people,

32:43.010 --> 32:47.380
not the sort of cartoon image
of so-called cavemen.

32:47.510 --> 32:50.140
HOWE: The space for
their brain in their head

32:50.260 --> 32:52.720
is bigger than ours.

32:52.850 --> 32:54.180
And they know from pollen

32:54.310 --> 32:57.520
that they put flowers
on their graves.

32:57.640 --> 33:00.230
That meant they had compassion.

33:01.770 --> 33:04.110
TSOUKALOS:
Neanderthals not only had

33:04.230 --> 33:07.910
much, much larger brains,
but also their bodies.

33:08.030 --> 33:10.030
I mean, they were
walking refrigerators.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.990
They were as strong
as you can imagine.

33:12.120 --> 33:16.120
So what made
the difference here?

33:16.250 --> 33:17.620
Extraterrestrials.

33:19.790 --> 33:23.630
NARRATOR: If, as many alleged
alien abductees have testified,

33:23.750 --> 33:27.130
extraterrestrials are performing
genetic experiments on humans

33:27.260 --> 33:28.590
for their own benefit,

33:28.720 --> 33:31.220
could they have favored
Homo sapiens

33:31.350 --> 33:35.060
over Homo neanderthalensis
because it was a species

33:35.180 --> 33:37.270
more compatible with their own?

33:37.390 --> 33:40.480
Or did they create
numerous hominins,

33:40.600 --> 33:45.110
and humans represent the most
favorable parts of each of them?

33:45.230 --> 33:49.150
In either case,
two important questions remain.

33:49.280 --> 33:52.120
Is this process still underway,

33:52.240 --> 33:56.250
and if so, what is
the ultimate objective?

33:56.370 --> 34:01.420
One theory is that
they are a dying race,

34:01.540 --> 34:06.760
and that by harvesting
genetic material from humans,

34:06.880 --> 34:11.130
they are injecting
into their own genome

34:11.260 --> 34:15.010
some new genetic material
which will help save them.

34:15.139 --> 34:20.980
Another related theory is
let's take human DNA,

34:21.100 --> 34:23.400
let's take alien DNA,

34:23.520 --> 34:26.570
and let's create
something even better.

34:26.690 --> 34:30.820
When we hybridize something,
we do so to gain a benefit.

34:30.949 --> 34:34.449
We take a particular line,
and we breed,

34:34.580 --> 34:38.370
and we gradually get
a stronger, faster,

34:38.500 --> 34:40.659
better racehorse.

34:40.790 --> 34:42.960
Extraterrestrials are
effectively doing

34:43.080 --> 34:45.670
the same thing to us
as a species.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.460
NARRATOR: Theories abound
as to the purpose behind

34:49.590 --> 34:52.219
a possible alien
hybridization project,

34:52.340 --> 34:55.510
but is it all mere speculation?

34:57.350 --> 35:00.680
Some ancient astronaut theorists
believe the ultimate evidence

35:00.810 --> 35:04.690
that an alien hybridization
project is in fact underway,

35:04.810 --> 35:07.860
and clues as to
the true motives behind it,

35:07.980 --> 35:12.530
can be found by examining
an incredible UFO encounter

35:12.650 --> 35:15.700
reported by members
of the U.S. Air Force.

35:18.580 --> 35:22.040
Rendlesham Forest,
Suffolk County, England.

35:22.160 --> 35:26.210
December 26, 1980.

35:26.340 --> 35:29.500
A glowing craft is reported
near an air base

35:29.630 --> 35:33.550
leased to the United States
Air Force by the RAF.

35:33.680 --> 35:38.180
Two U.S. servicemen are
dispatched to the site

35:38.310 --> 35:40.520
to investigate what they believe
could be a possible

35:40.640 --> 35:42.140
downed aircraft.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.230
(crickets chirping)

35:46.610 --> 35:49.230
When they arrive,
the men observe

35:49.360 --> 35:51.900
a strange triangular craft
on the ground,

35:52.030 --> 35:54.610
approximately three meters wide
at its base.

35:57.120 --> 36:00.870
One of the men, U.S. Air Force
Sergeant Jim Penniston,

36:00.990 --> 36:03.000
notices an inscription
on the side of the aircraft,

36:03.120 --> 36:05.460
and reaches out to touch it.

36:07.290 --> 36:10.840
One of the key points
in Jim's testimony

36:10.960 --> 36:14.260
is that he touched
the side of the UFO

36:14.380 --> 36:18.680
and received a sort of
telepathic download

36:18.800 --> 36:23.930
of ones and zeroes
that he then wrote down

36:24.060 --> 36:26.400
in his police notebook.

36:26.520 --> 36:30.360
Years later,
a computer programmer

36:30.480 --> 36:32.690
took this information,

36:32.820 --> 36:35.450
ran it through
a translation program,

36:35.570 --> 36:38.570
and a message emerged.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.660
The message read as follows.

36:40.780 --> 36:43.950
"Exploration of humanity

36:44.080 --> 36:48.670
"continuous
for planetary advance,

36:48.790 --> 36:51.800
"eyes of your eyes,

36:51.920 --> 36:55.010
origin year 8100."

36:55.130 --> 36:58.090
There was also a series

36:58.220 --> 37:01.890
of latitudinal
and longitudinal coordinates

37:02.010 --> 37:06.270
that matched up with locations
such as the Great Pyramid,

37:06.390 --> 37:09.980
the Temple of Apollo at Naxos,

37:10.110 --> 37:13.360
the Nazca Lines in Peru,

37:13.480 --> 37:15.650
Sedona in Arizona.

37:15.780 --> 37:17.150
All around the world,

37:17.280 --> 37:22.450
sites of great
sacred significance.

37:22.580 --> 37:27.540
So Jim Penniston came up
with all this information

37:27.660 --> 37:32.250
without knowing a thing
in real life about binary code.

37:32.380 --> 37:37.260
When one sees
"origin year 8100,"

37:37.380 --> 37:39.010
one is forced to speculate,

37:39.130 --> 37:42.430
might we be looking
not just at extraterrestrials

37:42.550 --> 37:45.810
but time travelers
from the future?

37:45.930 --> 37:49.560
And if that's the case,
why did they come here?

37:49.690 --> 37:51.980
REDFERN:
In the distant future,

37:52.110 --> 37:54.480
the human race is dying out.

37:54.610 --> 37:57.360
Well, how do you save
the human race?

37:57.490 --> 37:59.150
Maybe you go back in time

37:59.280 --> 38:04.740
and essentially reap
eggs, DNA, cells

38:04.870 --> 38:08.870
as a means to try and beef up
the species in the future.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.290
But by doing that, you present
yourself as extraterrestrials,

38:13.420 --> 38:15.000
so that the people of today

38:15.130 --> 38:17.880
won't actually know
who they really are.

38:18.010 --> 38:20.510
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

38:20.630 --> 38:22.550
that an alien
hybridization project

38:22.680 --> 38:25.680
is of benefit to both
the extraterrestrials

38:25.810 --> 38:28.520
and their human subjects
because they are in fact

38:28.640 --> 38:31.230
one and the same?

38:31.350 --> 38:34.190
And are future humans
posing as aliens

38:34.310 --> 38:36.570
to harvest valuable
genetic material

38:36.690 --> 38:39.860
in order to take that material
back with them

38:39.990 --> 38:42.700
and ensure humanity's future?

38:52.080 --> 38:54.130
NARRATOR:
Beijing, China.

38:54.250 --> 38:57.500
November 5, 2017.

38:57.630 --> 39:01.840
During a video presentation
at the Tencent WE Summit,

39:01.970 --> 39:04.850
Stephen Hawking warns that
in order to ensure

39:04.970 --> 39:06.890
the survival of the human race,

39:07.010 --> 39:10.560
we must work to develop
the means to leave planet Earth.

39:10.680 --> 39:13.850
While much of the speculation
regarding the purpose

39:13.980 --> 39:16.980
behind a possible
alien hybridization project

39:17.110 --> 39:19.030
has to do with extraterrestrials

39:19.150 --> 39:21.280
trying to find a way
to live on Earth,

39:21.400 --> 39:25.240
could it be that the goal is
in fact the exact opposite?

39:25.370 --> 39:28.030
Are humans being
genetically altered

39:28.160 --> 39:30.410
in preparation
for a future existence

39:30.540 --> 39:32.460
on another planet?

39:32.580 --> 39:38.090
We're constantly discovering
new ancestors to-to humans.

39:38.210 --> 39:41.170
Just when we think
we've got it all figured out

39:41.300 --> 39:44.590
and who our early ancestors are,
they find somebody new.

39:44.720 --> 39:48.010
And you have to wonder
just why are there so many

39:48.140 --> 39:50.850
different ancestors of humans,

39:50.970 --> 39:55.400
and are we being genetically
engineered ultimately

39:55.520 --> 39:58.980
until the perfect vehicle

39:59.110 --> 40:03.450
that the extraterrestrials want
has been created.

40:03.570 --> 40:06.700
So, in theory,
then we'll be ready

40:06.820 --> 40:09.530
to be a spacefaring race,

40:09.660 --> 40:12.040
ready to go into the stars,

40:12.160 --> 40:15.080
to return to the stars
and to join

40:15.210 --> 40:17.880
these other
extraterrestrial races

40:18.000 --> 40:20.250
that are watching us right now.

40:22.010 --> 40:24.260
If you were to ask me

40:24.380 --> 40:27.680
what does Project Hybrid
mean to me,

40:27.800 --> 40:31.560
I would kind of view it
as like an ongoing

40:31.680 --> 40:34.940
secret clandestine program

40:35.060 --> 40:39.650
that revolves around
the physical manipulation

40:39.770 --> 40:44.650
of the human race,
going back not just recent times

40:44.780 --> 40:47.990
but potentially
millions of years ago.

40:48.110 --> 40:50.240
TSOUKALOS: There are
some who have suggested

40:50.370 --> 40:54.870
that between 15 and 30 percent
of present-day humans

40:55.000 --> 40:57.460
allegedly are hybrids.

40:57.580 --> 41:03.800
What I am saying is that
all of us already are hybrids.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.840
Homo sapiens sapiens
would not exist

41:06.970 --> 41:09.760
without the artificial
mutation of our genes

41:09.890 --> 41:11.720
by extraterrestrials.

41:11.850 --> 41:17.390
So we already are the hybrids,
and perhaps more hybrids

41:17.520 --> 41:21.770
are being created right now
in order to continue

41:21.900 --> 41:24.730
this extraterrestrial evolution.

41:24.860 --> 41:28.110
NARRATOR: Has human evolution
been merely the product

41:28.240 --> 41:30.240
of natural selection,

41:30.370 --> 41:33.740
as mainstream scientists
and anthropologists believe?

41:33.870 --> 41:38.920
Or have we benefitted from
extraterrestrial engineering?

41:39.040 --> 41:42.460
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

41:42.590 --> 41:45.670
the answer is a profound yes.

41:45.800 --> 41:48.630
And they believe that
not only have humans

41:48.760 --> 41:52.850
been genetically altered in an
effort to ensure our survival,

41:52.970 --> 41:56.980
but that our evolution
has been accelerated

41:57.100 --> 42:00.810
so that we will be able to join
with our alien ancestors

42:00.940 --> 42:03.480
and begin our journey
to the stars

42:03.610 --> 42:05.980
in the not too distant future.
