[BO narrating]
Previously on Lost Girl:

00:07.425 --> 00:09.666
Cassie, it's Bo.
If you're there, pick up.

00:09.886 --> 00:10.841
What's this about Cassie?

00:11.053 --> 00:12.213
She's been missing
for twelve hours.

00:12.430 --> 00:13.510
[TAMSIN] We think something
bad has happened to her.

00:13.723 --> 00:15.588
This ledger contains
all the names of the Fae

00:15.808 --> 00:17.309
[TRICK] who have passed
through our colony.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.019
[DYSON] And Trick's
ledger is missing.

00:19.228 --> 00:20.638
You happen to know
anything about that?

00:20.855 --> 00:21.605
Don't look at me mate.

00:21.814 --> 00:24.021
[LAUREN] Cassie.
What do you remember?

00:24.233 --> 00:26.349
Oh, come on, Cassie.
Who did this to you?

00:26.569 --> 00:27.854
We did it to ourselves.

00:28.070 --> 00:31.813
[BO] My dad is Hades. He's
trying to use me for something.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.614
Something terrible.

00:36.829 --> 00:46.830
[music box plays]

01:11.447 --> 01:12.948
[BO gasps]

01:15.243 --> 01:16.653
Lauren?

01:24.252 --> 01:25.037
Hey.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.208
[BO] Hey.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.160
[TAMSIN yawns]

01:28.381 --> 01:30.963
I had the weirdest dream.

01:31.175 --> 01:35.259
l was driving in my truck...
and you were there.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.553
Wait. Were you there?

01:37.765 --> 01:40.051
[TAMSIN] Yeah.
You were very much there.

01:40.268 --> 01:42.634
| just really wanted
a burger, y'know?

01:42.853 --> 01:46.095
But nothing was open.
Everything was closed forever.

01:46.315 --> 01:50.479
The drive-throughs
were closed, forever.

01:50.695 --> 01:53.152
Sounds terrifying.

01:53.364 --> 01:54.820
It was.

02:00.705 --> 02:01.660
I'm hungry.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.863
[BO] Well, why don't I
make us some breakfast, huh?

02:04.083 --> 02:06.199
Half Cap'n Crunch,
half Lucky Charms?

02:07.545 --> 02:08.751
I love that you
know howl like it.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.249
Well, that's what
roomies are for.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.001
[giggles]

02:13.926 --> 02:15.791

02:17.179 --> 02:17.929
[WOMAN] Hey sarge?

02:18.139 --> 02:19.219
[MAN] We just checked it.

02:19.432 --> 02:23.345
[COPS murmur]

02:25.646 --> 02:28.137
So, do you think
Clay Jonas will be here?

02:29.734 --> 02:31.474
Thought I told you
to stay in the car.

02:31.694 --> 02:34.026
Twenty bucks says he'll
go number one in the draft.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.648
This is a crime scene, Mark.

02:35.865 --> 02:38.151
It's not really the place
to ask for an autograph.

02:40.202 --> 02:43.365
Is that... Jake Marshall?

02:43.581 --> 02:45.663
[MARK] Twelve hundred
receiving yards this season.

02:45.875 --> 02:48.662
Twelve touchdowns.
This guy was a machine.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.994
I can't believe he's really dead.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.797
What is that?

02:59.430 --> 03:01.887
It's a triskele.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.760
A triple spiral.

03:13.944 --> 03:16.981
I thought you said we weren't
supposed to touch anything.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.985
I said you're not
supposed to touch anything.

03:27.958 --> 03:28.037
[opening theme]

03:28.042 --> 03:32.957
[opening theme]

03:34.924 --> 03:37.882
He was killed last night.
Beaten to death.

03:38.094 --> 03:40.881
I think this Fae cult that
I've been tracking is involved.

03:41.097 --> 03:42.086
Why would a Fae cult
wanna knock off

03:42.306 --> 03:43.295
a human football player?

03:43.516 --> 03:45.006
He's a pretty
high profile target.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.056
You know him?

03:46.268 --> 03:48.099
Yeah. Jake Marshall?

03:48.312 --> 03:49.222
[TAMSIN] Wide receiver
for the Thunder.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.554
He's gonna go number
one in the draft next week.

03:51.774 --> 03:52.604
Or was.

03:52.817 --> 03:53.977
I didn't know you
were such a sports fan.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.808
I'm not, but he's hot.

03:56.028 --> 04:00.442
I mean,
not you hot, but hot.

04:00.658 --> 04:03.525
The three original victims were
all in the correctional system.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.655
This kid's an athlete.
What's the connection?

04:05.871 --> 04:08.829
I found this symbol
on all of their bodies.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.124
What is it?

04:12.336 --> 04:14.042
[DYSON] It's a symbol
of death and reincarnation.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.416
It's used by end of days cults.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.133
[DYSON] Look at this.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.714
[DYSON] There's something
larger at play here.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.215
I wanna get close
to this football team;

04:24.432 --> 04:25.387
see what we can find out.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.135
You don't think
we'll look a tad suspicious

04:27.351 --> 04:29.307
standing on the sidelines
of a football practice?

04:29.520 --> 04:31.932
Not if we're cheerleaders.

04:32.148 --> 04:34.810
You're right. Cheerleaders
get recruited for pro teams too.

04:35.025 --> 04:35.775
They do?

04:35.985 --> 04:38.692
[TAMSIN]
Yeah. Laker Girls, Buffalo Jills,

04:38.904 --> 04:41.987

pompoms, Tam-tam,

flirt some intel out of

04:50.082 --> 04:50.741
All right.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.994
Wait. Tamsin, a cheerleader?

04:53.210 --> 04:54.325
You don't think I can
dupe a bunch of girls

04:54.545 --> 04:57.036

04:57.256 --> 04:59.588
Well, you don't
exactly scream, "perky."

05:39.507 --> 05:41.839
Yeah. I'm fine.

Okay.

Ugh. I can smell their
insecurity from here.

like this in high school.

one very special cheerleader.

You'll be
competing with the top

06:10.496 --> 06:11.406

show me whatcha got?

captain of the team.

And she doesn't go here.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.754
Ah, this is Tamsin.

06:26.971 --> 06:28.256
Her school doesn't
have a cheerleading team,

06:28.472 --> 06:30.804
so she's auditioning
with you guys.

06:31.016 --> 06:34.133
Aren't you a little tall
to be a cheerleader?

06:34.353 --> 06:36.469
What, you didn't make
the football team?

06:36.689 --> 06:39.931
I prefer rugby. Less padding.

06:40.150 --> 06:44.143
Okay! One second.
Just stretch amongst yourselves.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.649
[BO] Um, the goal is
to infiltrate the team,

06:46.865 --> 06:47.900
not alienate them.

06:48.117 --> 06:50.859
She started it. Please let
me kick her boney little ass.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.534
Uh, no. And
simmer down, okay?

06:52.746 --> 06:56.455
The point of going undercover,
is staying undercover.

06:56.667 --> 06:57.577
Fine.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.329
But I could snap her
little neck and feel no remorse.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.081
Yes. l have no doubt.

07:01.297 --> 07:05.506
All right. Who's up first?

07:05.718 --> 07:07.254
I'll go.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.334
Oh, good. A volunteer.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.216
Are you sure
you want to go first?

07:14.435 --> 07:16.096
Definitely.

07:16.312 --> 07:18.052
Great. Great.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.433
Um. Well, why don't we start off
with something simple like a--

07:20.649 --> 07:24.733
Round-off double
back handspring back tuck?

07:24.945 --> 07:25.980
Or, uh, maybe a--

07:26.196 --> 07:28.482
Round-off double
back handspring back tuck?

07:28.699 --> 07:29.484
Sure.

07:29.700 --> 07:30.689

07:58.979 --> 07:59.809
[BRINKLEY] Don't touch me.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.307
Whatever.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.980
You wanna see
how it's really done?

08:04.193 --> 08:07.981
Front flip round-off,
triple twist.

08:11.325 --> 08:14.032
Do you really think you
can stick that triple twist?

08:24.129 --> 08:25.630
Hmmm.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.042
That's great.

08:33.222 --> 08:34.632
[CHEERLEADER] Let's fight.

08:41.105 --> 08:41.685
Hi.

08:41.897 --> 08:42.682
What's your name?

08:42.898 --> 08:45.264
Derek Finley.
I'm the token guy.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.351
Ah, lucky guy to be
surrounded by all these ladies.

08:48.570 --> 08:49.980
Not when their cycles
are aligned I'm not.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.528
[BO] Good point.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.197
Must be hard to focus
during such a tough time.

08:54.410 --> 08:55.274
I heard about the murder.

08:55.494 --> 08:56.984
[DEREK] Can you imagine?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.990
Who would do such a thing?

08:59.206 --> 09:00.912
I mean I could hazard a guess.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.581
Brinkley may look nice,

09:02.793 --> 09:05.409
[DEREK] but you steal one
of her Bioré nose strips...

09:05.629 --> 09:07.415
you're basically dead.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.167
Did you know Jake Marshall?

09:09.383 --> 09:11.874
I kept my distance.
He's a bit of a bully.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.334
Especially to Clay.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.293
The quarterback?

09:14.513 --> 09:16.128
[FOOTBALL PLAYER]
Hut, hut, hut, hut!

09:16.348 --> 09:17.929
[BO] Is that why he's
not wearing an arm band?

09:18.142 --> 09:19.973
They weren't exactly BFFs.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.345
Clay's been getting
a lot of attention,

09:21.562 --> 09:23.052
with the draft
coming up and all, and...

09:23.272 --> 09:24.762
[DEREK] Jake was
pretty harsh towards him.

09:24.982 --> 09:27.314
If you ask me, I think
Jake was purposefully

09:27.526 --> 09:29.062
not running Clay's routes.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.939
You think Clay killed Jake?

09:31.155 --> 09:33.988
No. I mean, they
were competitive, but...

09:34.199 --> 09:35.780
Jake had a lot of enemies.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.029
Mmm. Doesn't sound like
you're much of a fan either.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.827
Not exactly. He broke
my nose last year.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.745
Ugh, that is terrible.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.119
Took two surgeries to
get it to look this good.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.792
So where were you on
the night that Jake was killed?

09:49.047 --> 09:51.038
Is this part of the interview?

09:51.258 --> 09:53.340
No, no. l was just wondering.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.012

10:05.105 --> 10:05.935
[GIRL 2] That was crazy.

10:06.148 --> 10:07.854

Oh my god, is he okay?

10:08.066 --> 10:12.651
[murmurs]

10:12.863 --> 10:13.568
Did you see that?

10:13.781 --> 10:14.520
Yeah.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.695
Ouch! I don't think
he's getting up.

10:15.908 --> 10:18.069
This team is not
having a good week.

10:23.123 --> 10:27.287
[clapping]

10:27.503 --> 10:28.618
There's no way a
human could do that.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.213
I'm starting to think
he's not so human.

10:30.422 --> 10:31.377
Fae cult member?

10:31.590 --> 10:33.126
Only one way to find out.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.422
What do you say | talk
to some of the players

10:34.635 --> 10:36.921
and you get up close
and personal with QB 1?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.798
Bring it on.

of water, aren't you?

Hey. You're Clay, right?

11:03.288 --> 11:05.324
Yeah, well you're not
supposed to be in here.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.665
That looked like a bad fall.
You okay?

11:08.877 --> 11:09.912
Look, I'm serious.
You know the rules

11:10.128 --> 11:12.164
and I'd like to
keep my scholarship.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.796
You're not wearing an arm band.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.260

Jake Marshall's death?

11:17.469 --> 11:21.007
Look. With all due
respect, sweetheart,

11:21.223 --> 11:22.713
I need to stay focused.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.423
[TAMSIN] Right. The big game.

11:24.643 --> 11:27.259
How do you remember all those
plays? I'd get so confused.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.640
By making sure I don't
have any distractions.

it you're gonna go

number one in the draft.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.104
Yeah, well there's a lot
of great players out there.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.651
[TAMSIN] One less
now that Jake's dead.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.274
That must be good for you.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.075
What, you think I did it?

11:44.288 --> 11:46.825
Oh, you and Jake
weren't exactly buds.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.326
Look, so what if I
hated the guy, okay?

11:49.543 --> 11:50.328
He was my best receiver.

11:50.544 --> 11:53.411
Why would I screw over
my team or my future?

11:53.630 --> 11:57.623
Because under pressure,
everyone has a breaking point.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.458
How'd you even get in here?

11:59.678 --> 12:03.170
Don't worry about it.
l was just leaving.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.224
[moans]

12:16.445 --> 12:18.527
Cassie?

12:18.739 --> 12:20.775
Cassie, can you hear me?

12:20.991 --> 12:23.277
Rain.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.745
[CASSlE] More rain.

12:25.954 --> 12:29.117
Flood. Storm.

12:30.876 --> 12:31.831
It's coming.

12:32.044 --> 12:33.830
[groans]

12:34.046 --> 12:36.037
[CASSlE] Darkness.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.633
No change.
Still recapping the apocalypse.

12:38.842 --> 12:39.797
I'll run a tox screen.

12:40.010 --> 12:40.999
[LAUREN]
And uh, get me a CPC.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.629
Sure.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.632
Well... Clay's not talking

12:48.852 --> 12:50.388
but he's definitely
hiding something.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.185
Well, if he's Fae,
we need to prove it.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.228
I'll call Lauren.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.942
Why don't you call Dyson?
He can smell it out.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.858
No, I'd rather leave the
testing to a medical expert.

12:59.071 --> 13:00.902
Medical expert.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.321
That's why you wanna
call Lauren, huh?

13:03.533 --> 13:04.397
What?

13:04.618 --> 13:05.733
Nothing.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.576
[LAUREN] How goes
the cheerleading?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.074
Would you be able to run
some tests on the players

13:10.290 --> 13:12.201
to figure out if our
quarterback is Fae?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.908
Oh, what? Tamsin
can't run some tests?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.993
Lauren, I need your help.

13:17.214 --> 13:18.499
[LAUREN] Mm, you mean
you need a doctor.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.922
No, I need you.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.842
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.142
You text me if there's any change.
I'm going for lunch.

13:33.355 --> 13:34.891
It's only ten o'clock.

13:35.107 --> 13:37.598
Yeah. I'm the boss.

13:40.529 --> 13:41.894
You need her, huh?

13:42.114 --> 13:42.819
Why don't you just stick to

13:43.031 --> 13:44.896
flirting with the
football players?

13:45.117 --> 13:47.779
Flirting?

13:47.995 --> 13:51.112
l have no idea what
you're talking about.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.340
What can I get you?

14:08.557 --> 14:10.297
Mmm, it's been a while.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.759
How about... Coquetel.

14:13.979 --> 14:17.688
A Coquetel? I haven't
made one of those in...

14:17.899 --> 14:19.685
well it must be a
thousand years at least.

14:19.901 --> 14:21.641
You're making me sound so old.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.444
Oh, no, |'m--|'m just excited.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.443
I don't even know if I
have all the ingredients.

14:27.659 --> 14:31.072
Ambrosia spirits if I recall.

14:31.288 --> 14:36.282
And the bark of the
chuchuhuasi tree soaked in rum.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.205
What am | forgetting?

14:40.422 --> 14:41.912
Boiled egg.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.542
[TRICK] That's it.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.057
[TRICK] They say...

14:51.266 --> 14:58.354
the Ancients call this drink
the drink of prophecy.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.351
The original cocktail.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.649
A classic.

15:03.862 --> 15:07.275
What can I say?
I'm a classic girl.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.947
You must be new to our colony.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.994
I haven't seen you
around here before.

15:15.207 --> 15:19.871
Just passing through.
Maybe I'll stay awhile.

15:20.087 --> 15:24.296
Well, if that's the case, then
I'll have you sign my ledger.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.044
If I knew where it was.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.335
[TRICK]
I've had it for centuries.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.215
It's the first time
I've misplaced it.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.807
[WOMAN] I'm sure you'll find it.

15:33.016 --> 15:37.100
Ancient things have
a way of... turning up.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.722
I hope so.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.429
Well, cheers!

15:47.030 --> 15:49.942
Okay boys, time to pee in a cup.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.364
Whoa, whoa.
What are you talkin' about?

15:51.576 --> 15:53.032
There's no drug test scheduled.

15:53.245 --> 15:54.280
Well, no, that's
why they call them

15:54.496 --> 15:57.158
surprise drug tests.
Surprise!

15:57.374 --> 15:58.830
Look, I ain't
doin' no drug test.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.157
Okay, well you have a choice.

16:00.377 --> 16:03.039
You can either pee in
a cup or I can draw blood.

16:03.255 --> 16:07.339
But if you pee in a cup,
I have to watch.

16:09.553 --> 16:12.761
No way some tiny lady doctor
is gonna watch me piss in a cup.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.509
Blood test it is.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.181
[sighs]

16:17.394 --> 16:18.804
You like to watch, huh?

16:20.230 --> 16:23.472
Okay then. Come with me.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.523
You really have the wrong girl.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.774
[LAUREN] You're next QB 1.

16:41.001 --> 16:44.038
Hey. You uh, you wanna spar?

16:44.254 --> 16:46.836
Yeah. Just let me finish this.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.879
Murders, right.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.174
You think it's that cult
you've been tracking?

16:51.386 --> 16:52.136
Could be.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.846
A bunch of Fae
chanting in bathrobes;

16:54.055 --> 16:55.386
how bad could
it really be, right?

16:55.599 --> 16:57.635
This kind of cult
comes with a body count.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.933
Heaven's Gate had mass suicides.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.726
The doomsday
cult in California?

17:01.938 --> 17:03.644
Yeah, it was Fae.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.222
Controlling humans.

17:05.442 --> 17:08.149
Huh. No wonder you're single.

17:09.404 --> 17:10.519
All right, smart guy.

17:10.739 --> 17:11.899
Show me what you got.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.571
Gimme a jab, jab, straight.

17:14.951 --> 17:15.986
[DYSON] Nice.
Keep your elbows in.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.613
Jab, jab, straight, hook.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.908
So are you, uh,
seeing anyone or...?

17:22.417 --> 17:24.203
Is this boxing
or brunch? Come on.

17:24.419 --> 17:25.920
Take that as a no.

17:27.088 --> 17:29.340
Know what happens
to nosy people?

17:31.051 --> 17:32.006
[DYSON chuckles]

17:32.219 --> 17:33.459
[chuckles]

17:33.678 --> 17:35.714
[WOMAN] Hello?

17:35.931 --> 17:37.467
Detective Dyson?

17:37.682 --> 17:39.297
Yes.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.427
[BOTH grunt]

17:40.644 --> 17:41.929
[MARK] Sorry.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.646
[WOMAN] I'm sorry to bother you.

17:43.855 --> 17:47.598
It's just, you haven't
returned any of my calls.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.944
Who told you you
could find me here?

17:50.153 --> 17:51.063
Miss...?

17:51.279 --> 17:54.362
Alicia Welles.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.782
I just didn't know
where else I could go.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.371
Well, what can I help you with?

18:00.580 --> 18:05.119
Um. It's my husband.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.291
He died a few weeks ago.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.253
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:13.176 --> 18:17.840
But I saw him. On the street.

18:18.056 --> 18:22.345
I know how this sounds, but--

18:22.560 --> 18:25.597
I arranged his funeral.

18:25.814 --> 18:29.102
[ALICIA] I held his ashes.

18:29.317 --> 18:32.559
But I saw him.

18:32.779 --> 18:36.271
And he looked right at me
like he didn't know me at all.

18:36.491 --> 18:39.153
[ALICIA] Your sergeant
thinks I'm crazy,

18:39.369 --> 18:43.703
but he told me you were the
working officer on this case.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.748
Loss of a spouse
is a terrible thing.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.452
Grief can sometimes manifest
itself in strange ways.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.920
I took a photo.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.931
I'll look into it.

19:14.946 --> 19:17.437
I needed someone to believe me.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.069
Here.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.952
Please call me if
anything comes up.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.457
[DYSON] I will.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.083
Thank you.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.178
She's hot.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.472
Her husband just died.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.426
So. She's still hot.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.476
[MARK chuckles]

19:49.689 --> 19:51.145
And she's human.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.564
Come on, man.
That's an old bullshit rule

19:52.776 --> 19:53.561
that doesn't
even make any sense.

19:53.777 --> 19:56.519
No, it's not. And, it does.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.194
It's just not
the way of the Fae.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.271
All right. Whatever,
Detective Buzzkill.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.323
At least you know she's single.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.762
How's Cassie doing? Any change?

20:21.971 --> 20:23.051
[LAUREN] No, nothing.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.676
You've gotta see this.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.804
Wow. You look...

20:29.020 --> 20:29.805
Wow.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.307
So, what is it that
I've gotta see?

20:32.524 --> 20:33.980
Right. Um, these
are urine samples

20:34.192 --> 20:35.227
from the football players.

20:35.443 --> 20:37.024
They're fascinating.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.319
Urine samples are fascinating?

20:39.531 --> 20:41.146
Urine samples can reveal
all kinds of secrets

20:41.366 --> 20:42.606
about the human body.

20:42.826 --> 20:45.738
It's a fountain--poor choice
of words--of information.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.114
Gives new meaning
to golden shower.

20:47.330 --> 20:48.240
Mhm. Watch what happens

20:48.456 --> 20:50.492
when I add a toxic solution.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.714
And now this.

20:59.926 --> 21:00.961
[BO] Nothing happened.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.212
I've never
seen anything like it.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.010
And drumroll, it's human.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.178
Seriously?

21:06.391 --> 21:07.346
We should call Trick.

21:07.559 --> 21:08.514
I actually have him
on speaker phone.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.011
Trick, are you still there?

21:10.228 --> 21:12.264
[TRICK] I'm here. Based
on your description,

21:12.480 --> 21:14.721
the sample appears
to be from a Heraclid.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.442
Don't tell me it's Fae.

21:16.651 --> 21:18.232
[TRICK]
No, Heraclids are humans.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.935
But with exceptional genes.

21:20.155 --> 21:23.238
They're strong, fast,
and incredibly resilient.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.112
What would cause
that kind of mutation?

21:26.327 --> 21:28.363
Heraclids are
descendants of Hercules.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.071
[BO] As in Hercules, Hercules?

21:31.291 --> 21:32.406
The one and only.

21:43.511 --> 21:44.626
[DYSON] What does this mean?

21:44.846 --> 21:47.178
I told you, I don't know.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.379
The sooner you
cooperate with the police,

21:48.600 --> 21:50.090
the sooner
this will all be over.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.141
[DYSON] How many
of you are there?

21:52.353 --> 21:53.217
What are you talking about?

21:56.107 --> 21:58.018
[DYSON] I can hold you
for twenty-four hours.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.646
Wouldn't want that to get
in the way of the big game.

22:00.862 --> 22:03.194
Look, I had nothing to
do with Jake's murder.

22:03.406 --> 22:04.612
If you have evidence,
then arrest me.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.985
If not, I have an
interview to get to.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.319
You're right.
I don't have evidence.

22:10.538 --> 22:14.247
But I do know your secret.

22:14.459 --> 22:15.323
What secret?

22:15.543 --> 22:17.534
I know you're a Heraclid.

22:17.754 --> 22:20.370
What? What is that?

22:23.009 --> 22:26.501
Just means you've
got good genes, kid.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.093
[scoffs]

22:33.394 --> 22:34.304
[DYSON] He doesn't know.

22:34.521 --> 22:35.351
[BO] Seriously?

22:35.563 --> 22:36.348
Yeah.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.065
Well, sometimes
ignorance is bliss.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.890
I know I'd be better off
not knowing who my father is.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.850
You know who your father is?

22:43.071 --> 22:45.562
Wha--no, no. I mean,
I know he's bad, but...

22:45.782 --> 22:47.318
No, I don't know
exactly who he is--no.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.774
I mean, I was just saying.

22:48.993 --> 22:50.779
Mark spent his whole life
not knowing who his father is.

22:50.995 --> 22:54.328
Hey, Mark is lucky
that he found you.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.244
Well, if Clay doesn't
know he's a Heraclid,

22:58.461 --> 23:00.668
I doubt he's in a Fae cult.

23:00.880 --> 23:01.869
[DYSON] Let's not
rule him out just yet.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.955
But yes, we do
need a new suspect.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.460
Any names come up on your end?

23:05.677 --> 23:06.792
[BO] No.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.593
But I do know someone
who likes to gossip.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.595
Getting ready for the big game?

23:14.811 --> 23:18.520
I think Brinkley stole
my lucky hair brush, again.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.641
Who's he?

23:19.857 --> 23:20.812
This is Detective Dyson.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.435
He's working on
the investigation.

23:22.652 --> 23:24.108
Like a real detective?

23:24.320 --> 23:27.483
I heard you might have some theories
about who killed Jake Marshall.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.314
Is there gonna be a trial?

23:29.534 --> 23:30.523
Would I have to testify?

23:30.743 --> 23:32.028
I-If you guys are
lookin' for suspects,

23:32.245 --> 23:34.907
I will, I will show
you some suspects.

23:35.123 --> 23:36.613
Open this.

23:36.833 --> 23:39.074
My locker? Yeah.

23:51.264 --> 23:52.845
This is the same blood
from the crime scene.

23:53.057 --> 23:54.638
Creepy fetish much?

23:54.851 --> 23:56.432
What are you doing
with Jake Marshall's jersey?

23:56.644 --> 23:59.727
I have no idea
how that got there.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.270
I'm taking him
down to the station.

24:01.482 --> 24:02.187
Come with me.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.981
[DEREK] What? Wait.

24:07.655 --> 24:17.030
[rock music plays]

24:17.248 --> 24:18.624
Hi.

24:18.833 --> 24:20.073
What are you doing?

24:20.293 --> 24:21.703
Practicing.

24:21.919 --> 24:22.704
For what?

24:22.920 --> 24:23.830
[MARK] A real fight.

24:24.047 --> 24:25.207
You see, the key is offense.

24:25.423 --> 24:27.129
You always wanna keep
your opponent off balance.

24:29.927 --> 24:30.757
I thought you
were supposed to

24:30.970 --> 24:33.347
subdue your enemy
without fighting.

24:33.556 --> 24:36.013
All warfare is
based on deception.

24:36.225 --> 24:37.601
And where'd you hear that?

24:37.810 --> 24:38.890
[GIRL] My parents.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.355
They said something's gonna
happen at the football game.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.100
[MARK] What do you mean?

24:50.198 --> 24:51.608
[GIRL] You're so sweaty.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.108
I like it.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.785
Where did you see that?

24:58.498 --> 25:02.537
Iris, what did
your parents say, exactly?

25:02.752 --> 25:07.121
They said everything
is gonna go boom.

25:13.096 --> 25:18.181
[murmurs]

25:18.393 --> 25:20.099
If you think we're gonna
let you cheer with us

25:20.311 --> 25:22.893
at the game,
you're delusional.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.687
I'm delusional?
You're the one who thinks

25:24.899 --> 25:27.356
she's gonna marry
an NFL player.

25:27.568 --> 25:30.480
Please. A career in
professional cheerleading

25:30.697 --> 25:33.564
is like, five years tops,
which gives me five years

25:33.783 --> 25:35.569
to rebrand myself
as a life coach.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.150
And if I'm gonna
have a lifestyle empire

25:37.370 --> 25:38.530
by the time I'm thirty,

25:38.746 --> 25:40.907
I don't really have
time to get married.

25:41.124 --> 25:43.206
Wow. You're so motivated.

25:43.418 --> 25:44.749
Yeah.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.703
I would kill to get recruited.

25:47.922 --> 25:49.253
But Clay said he's gonna
put in a good word

25:49.465 --> 25:51.421
when he goes pro, so...

25:51.634 --> 25:52.623
So it would
be good for you

25:52.844 --> 25:56.428
if Clay went number
one in the draft.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.300
Obvi.

26:00.435 --> 26:03.802

26:04.021 --> 26:05.227
Good to see you, Clay.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.180
It's good to see you, too.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.105
Hey.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.978
Hey. I think we
have a new suspect.

26:10.194 --> 26:10.899
Where's Dyson?

26:11.112 --> 26:12.977
He took Derek
in for questioning.

26:13.197 --> 26:14.733
What? Cheer boy. Why?

26:14.949 --> 26:16.280
[FEMALE INTERVIEWER] This is a
big game for the Thunder.

26:16.492 --> 26:19.780
How are you and the team dealing
with the loss of Jake Marshall?

26:19.996 --> 26:21.827
Uh, first off, I wanna
say Jake Marshall was

26:22.039 --> 26:24.496
a great player and a
key member on our team.

26:24.709 --> 26:26.040
[CLAY] But I have faith
that we're gonna pull together

26:26.252 --> 26:28.334
and play a great game
of football today.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.787
How do you feel about the
recent arrest of Derek Finley

26:31.007 --> 26:35.216
in conjunction with
Jake Marshall's murder?

26:35.428 --> 26:37.168
Um... What?

26:37.388 --> 26:40.004
Do you feel you could've
been a target too or...?

26:40.224 --> 26:42.385
[chuckles nervously]
Uh, why? He--He--He didn't.

26:42.602 --> 26:45.059
Well police found
evidence in Derek's locker.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.852
Did you ever feel
threatened? Did you--

26:47.064 --> 26:50.648
No, no, no, no.
Derek Finley is innocent.

26:50.860 --> 26:52.350
I mean you guys can--

26:52.570 --> 26:53.525
[CLAY sighs]
Look, he wasn't there then.

26:53.738 --> 26:56.821
You can check the
security tapes at the dorm.

26:57.033 --> 26:58.443
He...

27:02.288 --> 27:06.327
Derek was at home with
me the night of the murder.

27:06.542 --> 27:07.952
In bed.

27:09.420 --> 27:10.751
Derek is my boyfriend.

27:10.963 --> 27:15.923
[commotion]

27:16.135 --> 27:17.511
Talk about coming
out with a bang.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.211
Yeah, I guess they're
not our perps after all.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.057
[DEREK]
Reporters are everywhere.

27:26.270 --> 27:27.430
I had to use the
backdoor to get in.

27:27.647 --> 27:28.636
It's like we're on TMZ.

27:28.856 --> 27:29.936
Well I'm glad you texted me.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.229
I didn't know what else to do.

27:31.442 --> 27:33.182
I can't even deal with all this.

27:35.071 --> 27:35.685
Wanna chip?

27:35.905 --> 27:37.065
No. I'm good.

27:37.281 --> 27:38.612
Take them away from me.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.237
Please, |--| carbo load

27:49.001 --> 27:49.706
Who's she?

27:49.919 --> 27:52.285
[DEREK] This is Bo. She works
for the pro cheerleading teams.

27:52.505 --> 27:54.086
She handles media all the time.

27:54.298 --> 27:55.413
I just wanted to
tell you that I know

27:55.633 --> 27:57.840
what it is like to
live with a secret.

27:58.052 --> 28:00.759
And I think it's really
great what you did.

28:00.972 --> 28:03.304
Well, I love Derek.

28:03.516 --> 28:04.221
And I've been
wanting to come out

28:04.433 --> 28:06.469
about our relationship
for a long time.

28:06.686 --> 28:09.018
It's been exhausting
living a lie.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.848
Capital Sports.
They're the ones who said

28:13.067 --> 28:13.931
I couldn't say anything.

28:14.151 --> 28:15.186
Capital Sports?

28:15.403 --> 28:16.643
[CLAY] My PR reps.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.399
Well, they work for you.

28:18.614 --> 28:19.899
There's this new guy
who took over the firm

28:20.116 --> 28:21.856
and he told me I couldn't
tell anybody about Derek.

28:22.076 --> 28:22.986
Oh, how supportive.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.112
Right.

28:24.328 --> 28:24.862
[CLAY] They said they
were gonna be watching

28:25.079 --> 28:26.944
the game from
the booster's box.

28:27.164 --> 28:29.826
If we don't win this
game, my life's over.

28:30.042 --> 28:33.751
Hey. Don't worry
about your PR reps.

28:33.963 --> 28:36.204
Your team needs you.

28:38.676 --> 28:41.167
Since Clay and Derek
have alibied each other out,

28:41.387 --> 28:43.048
we need to cast a wider net.

28:43.264 --> 28:46.131
My money's on
cheer-bitch, Brinkley.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.465
How's Clay doin'?

28:47.685 --> 28:50.347
Well, it turns out
his PR firm, Capital Sports,

28:50.563 --> 28:53.555
was pressuring him to keep
his relationship a secret.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.856
Captial Sports Public Relations?

28:56.068 --> 28:57.478
[BO] Yeah, why?

29:01.282 --> 29:02.397
[DYSON] That's Kevin Brown.

29:02.617 --> 29:04.323
He's one of the victims
from the elevator crash.

29:06.954 --> 29:10.037

is Clay's PR rep?

is goin' on here?

29:11.667 --> 29:12.747

it is it looks like

29:15.004 --> 29:17.666
[MARK] Hey. So something is
going to go down at the game.

29:17.882 --> 29:18.462
What do you mean?

29:18.674 --> 29:20.289
I met this girl. I think
she might be in the cult.

29:20.509 --> 29:21.794
They could be
targeting other players.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.343
Clay did say that his
PR rep would kill him

29:24.555 --> 29:25.931
if he didn't win the game.

29:26.140 --> 29:26.890
[30}
I'm starting to think it's more than

29:27.099 --> 29:28.134
just a figure of speech.

29:28.351 --> 29:30.683
Yeah, but it's too
late to call it off.

29:30.895 --> 29:32.055
We need to get down there.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.932
Look for anything suspicious.

29:34.148 --> 29:36.013
It'd be great if we could
get someone on the field.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.894
I'll suit up.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.270
You're gonna play football?

29:39.487 --> 29:41.603
Yeah. Who better
than a Valkyrie

29:41.822 --> 29:43.107
to protect
the players on the field?

29:43.324 --> 29:44.530
But you don't think,
uh, the guys are gonna

29:44.742 --> 29:47.154
notice a girl in the huddle?

29:47.370 --> 29:48.906
Little doubt goes a long way.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.282
Plus, I'm not really
a sidelines kind of girl.

29:51.499 --> 29:53.455
[BO] Let's go.

29:53.668 --> 29:54.703

It's game day people,

30:20.945 --> 30:23.982
and it's a packed crowd
here at Thunder Stadium.

30:24.198 --> 30:26.564
All eyes are
on QB Clay Jonas,

30:26.784 --> 30:27.990
who's expected
to go number one

30:28.202 --> 30:29.988
in the draft next week.

30:30.204 --> 30:32.160
But this isn't
just about a game.

30:32.373 --> 30:34.284
This is about a
team pulling together

30:34.500 --> 30:36.832
after a loss of
one of their own.

30:38.462 --> 30:40.248
Let the game begin.

Very busy. Private party.

Hello again.

30:54.437 --> 30:56.678
Well you just keep
popping up, don't you?

30:56.897 --> 30:59.104
You know her?

30:59.316 --> 31:00.601
We've met.

Wow. You are really pretty.

31:10.494 --> 31:11.609
[HERATIO] So no touching.

31:11.829 --> 31:13.490
Learned that the hard way.

31:13.706 --> 31:16.573

31:16.792 --> 31:18.202
Still pretending to be one?

31:18.419 --> 31:22.253
You took over an entire
PR firm to promote one client.

31:22.465 --> 31:23.250
Why?

31:23.466 --> 31:25.798
Let's just say
that Clay is like family.

31:26.886 --> 31:27.875
He's famous now.

31:28.095 --> 31:30.177
His face is gonna
be on a protein bar.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.504
[IRIS] Peanut chocolate fudge.

31:31.724 --> 31:32.804
I picked the flavor.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.723
And the bigger
Clay's fanbase grows,

31:34.935 --> 31:36.596
the better for the family.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.768
Family, huh?

31:39.857 --> 31:42.394
If you care
about Clay so much,

31:42.610 --> 31:43.599
why did you
put a bloody jersey

31:43.819 --> 31:45.434
in his
boyfriend's locker?

31:46.530 --> 31:47.906
I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:48.115 --> 31:50.151
You framed Derek for
Jake Marshall's murder.

31:50.367 --> 31:54.110
Murder. Such an ugly word.
We prefer risk management.

31:54.330 --> 31:55.160

31:55.372 --> 31:56.498
Nice spin. Well done.

32:00.002 --> 32:02.209
Things got a little out of hand.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.958
A little? The guy
was beaten to death.

32:05.174 --> 32:06.880
It was a bit excessive.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.550
When Jake Marshall found
out about Clay's relationship,

32:09.762 --> 32:12.629
we thought there
would be an issue.

32:12.848 --> 32:14.304
[HERATIO] We had
to do something.

32:14.517 --> 32:16.473
[BO] So you killed
Jake Marshall?

32:16.685 --> 32:17.765
And then you
made Clay keep quiet

32:17.978 --> 32:20.264
about his relationship
with Derek. That's real classy.

32:20.481 --> 32:21.140
[WOMAN]
Do you think we care

32:21.357 --> 32:22.767
who Clay spends
his time with?

32:22.983 --> 32:24.018
We are so above that.

32:24.235 --> 32:25.850
It's these unevolved humans

32:26.070 --> 32:27.731
who seem to care so much.

32:27.947 --> 32:30.313
But, I had no idea that
Clay's little announcement

32:30.533 --> 32:33.741
would make his fans
love him even more.

32:33.953 --> 32:37.116
Uh, humans. I guess
we underestimated them.

32:37.331 --> 32:38.571
Isn't it sweet?

32:40.918 --> 32:43.830
we'd like to get
back to the game.

If you think we're done here,
you underestimate me.

Ugh, get rid of her.

32:51.387 --> 32:54.424
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

32:54.640 --> 32:59.725
No. You don't know
who you're dealing with.

33:48.235 --> 33:51.727
The Thunder are at the
forty yard line, down by five.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.812
It's fourth down and ten.

33:54.033 --> 33:58.026
[cheering]

33:58.245 --> 33:59.485
[TAMSIN]
'Kay, we need to win this game.

34:00.998 --> 34:03.956
[CLAY] That's forty yards.
You think you can make it?

34:04.168 --> 34:06.159
Trust me.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.120
All right guys.
Goin' for a Hail Mary.

34:09.340 --> 34:10.045
One, two, three.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.667
[ALL] Break!

34:13.886 --> 34:14.921
[CLAY] Left side, left side.

34:15.137 --> 34:16.468
Strong side, right.

34:16.680 --> 34:21.390
[commotion]

34:21.602 --> 34:23.763
[CHEERLEADERS]
Defense! Defense!

34:23.979 --> 34:24.934
Defense!

34:25.147 --> 34:26.353
[commotion]

34:26.565 --> 34:29.773
[cheering]

34:29.985 --> 34:32.397
[ANNOUNCER] Jonas needs
a touchdown to win the game.

34:32.613 --> 34:35.070
You can feel the
electricity in the air, folks.

34:39.620 --> 34:43.363
[CLAY] Hut twenty-two.
Hut twenty-two.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.038
Hut, hut, hut!

34:45.251 --> 34:46.741
[PLAYERS grunt]

35:38.554 --> 35:40.636
[ANNOUNCER] Phenomenal pass!
Thunder win!

35:40.848 --> 35:42.463
--[ANNOUNCER] Thunder win!
--[CLAY] Yeah!

35:42.683 --> 35:51.102
[cheering continues]

35:51.317 --> 35:53.023
Touchdown.

36:00.784 --> 36:01.364
[TAMSIN] Yeah.

36:01.577 --> 36:03.238
[giggles]

36:16.342 --> 36:17.127
Nice catch!

36:17.343 --> 36:18.048
[BOTH laugh]

36:18.260 --> 36:18.885
We won!

36:19.094 --> 36:19.674
[CLAY] You did it!

36:19.887 --> 36:21.297
[TAMSIN] Yeah.

36:24.725 --> 36:28.513
You were amazing out there.

36:33.317 --> 36:34.898
I just took your advice.

36:46.955 --> 36:47.705
[TAMSIN] We won!

36:47.915 --> 36:49.496
You're hurt. What happened?

36:49.708 --> 36:52.495
We just lost. Big time.

36:53.921 --> 36:55.957
[groans]

36:56.173 --> 36:58.209
[ALICIA] Thanks for
calling me back, Detective.

36:58.425 --> 37:00.461
[DYSON] Just Dyson, please.

37:00.677 --> 37:04.636
Dyson. So, anything?

37:04.848 --> 37:07.100
Do you have any family,
that lives out of town?

37:07.309 --> 37:09.345
[DYSON] That maybe you
could stay with for awhile?

37:09.561 --> 37:12.678
I think good change of scenery
is what you need right now.

37:14.441 --> 37:17.604
I thought you'd
take me seriously.

37:17.820 --> 37:19.526
I guess I was wrong.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.696
I know he's out there.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.321
And I don't
care if I sound crazy.

37:26.537 --> 37:28.823
You loved your
husband very much.

37:31.667 --> 37:34.534
I'm not gonna stop looking.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.368
I know.

37:38.715 --> 37:42.503
If you need me, I'll be here.

37:48.475 --> 37:49.385
[TAMSIN] What the
hell were those Fae?

37:49.601 --> 37:51.978
[BO] I have no idea.
But they killed Jake Marshall.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.267
And they did something to me.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.230
[TAMSIN] Let me see.

37:54.440 --> 37:58.524
[BO gasps in pain]

37:58.735 --> 37:59.440
[TAMSIN] What is that?

37:59.653 --> 38:03.566
I don't know. I've never
felt anything like it.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.489
I can still feel it.

38:06.702 --> 38:09.193
[30}
She struck me with lightning.

38:09.413 --> 38:10.823
Come here.

38:19.298 --> 38:20.162
Thanks.

38:20.382 --> 38:21.588
Oh shit.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.210
What the hell?

38:23.427 --> 38:25.884
You must've left
it all on the field.

38:26.096 --> 38:26.505
Let me try again.

38:26.722 --> 38:29.805
[BO] No, no.
I feel fine. It's just--

38:30.017 --> 38:31.553
Why won't it go away?

38:31.768 --> 38:33.508
Those Fae are strong.

38:33.729 --> 38:34.559
Crazy strong.

38:34.771 --> 38:36.272
Yeah. We need to talk to Trick.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.315
Okay. Thanks.

38:40.527 --> 38:42.267
What are girlfriends for?

38:46.783 --> 38:48.284
Girlfriends?

38:54.833 --> 38:58.291
[BO] Three humans. All killed
in the elevator crash.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.620
And then possessed
by some kind of Fae.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.455
Yeah. Who woke up in
my clinic and killed Lisa.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.131
This one was here today.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.129
[TAMSIN]
What did she want?

39:06.345 --> 39:07.755
A drink.
A very old one.

39:07.971 --> 39:10.007
Well, I went on
a date with this one.

39:10.224 --> 39:12.385
Ugh. Creep fest.

39:12.601 --> 39:14.341
He's the one who
was targeting the oracles.

39:14.561 --> 39:15.892
Yeah, and showed them
something so awful

39:16.104 --> 39:17.640
they removed their own eyes.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.723
[TRICK] Perhaps so they couldn't
foresee what was coming.

39:23.445 --> 39:25.777
But why did they choose
these three bodies?

39:25.989 --> 39:28.571
More importantly,
who the hell are "they"?

39:28.784 --> 39:31.491
They said Clay
was "like family."

39:32.996 --> 39:35.078
[BO] And she was
feeding off the crowd.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.406
Feeding? Feeding how?

39:37.626 --> 39:41.084
Every time Clay scored,
the crowd would cheer.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.252
[BO] And she... glowed.

39:43.465 --> 39:45.626
Like a Fae stage mom?

39:45.842 --> 39:47.753
Like a proud parent.

39:47.970 --> 39:51.508
When I was a boy, I'd heard
stories of an ancient order

39:51.723 --> 39:54.840
that channeled their
children's energy to gain power.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.925
Is it possible that
the Fae who attacked Bo

39:57.145 --> 39:58.601
are somehow
connected to Clay?

39:58.814 --> 40:01.601
Well, Clay is a Heraclid.
A descendant of Hercules.

40:01.817 --> 40:04.854
Well, wasn't the father
of Hercules Zeus, the Greek God?

40:05.070 --> 40:06.526
[TRICK] Humans have many
names for the Ancients,

40:06.738 --> 40:09.571
but they haven't existed
for thousands of years.

40:10.993 --> 40:12.324
What if they're back?

40:12.536 --> 40:14.868
If the legends are true,

40:15.080 --> 40:16.240
the Ancients are
the most powerful

40:16.456 --> 40:18.617
Fae family that ever lived.

40:18.834 --> 40:21.826
And they just fed off
of hundreds of people.

40:37.603 --> 40:39.389
[clears throat]

40:42.816 --> 40:45.273
[ZEE] Bo Dennis.

40:45.485 --> 40:47.350
So she's the one.

40:47.571 --> 40:48.435
And only.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.395
She found us a lot
sooner than I'd hoped.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.277
Thanks to you.

40:58.332 --> 41:02.166
Iris. Stop breathing
on the glass.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.422
[ZEE] Iris, are you deaf?

41:06.632 --> 41:08.247
Why did she have to take
the body of a teenager?

41:08.467 --> 41:09.126
[HERATIO] I don't know.

41:09.343 --> 41:11.504
She listens to you.

41:11.720 --> 41:15.633
Iris, just... l-listen to
your mother, please.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.259
Yes, Daddy.

41:18.393 --> 41:20.008
Thank you.

41:21.396 --> 41:25.184
So the Succubus finding us,
how is that my fault exactly?

41:25.400 --> 41:27.607
The whole point of
my plan was discretion.

41:27.819 --> 41:32.483
I wish you would stop
referring to it as your plan.

41:32.699 --> 41:34.030
Can you guys stop fighting?

41:34.242 --> 41:37.279
No, we're not fighting, Iris.
We're just... talking.

41:37.496 --> 41:40.078
Your father just made
a mistake, that's all.

41:40.290 --> 41:42.406
Actions have consequences.

41:45.754 --> 41:46.789
We need to move fast.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.621
[HERATIO] I don't think it's a
good idea. We talked about this.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.251
Well I'm over talking.

41:51.468 --> 41:53.834
It's too soon.

41:54.763 --> 41:57.004
[ZEE] It's not my fault, is it?

41:57.224 --> 41:59.135
[HERATIO]
Well, what about discretion?

41:59.351 --> 42:00.887
You over that too?

42:02.979 --> 42:06.563
Yes. I am.

42:10.362 --> 42:13.775
Okay, eh...
Let's not be rash.

42:13.990 --> 42:18.905
Why don't we... go out for a
nice dinner and talk about this.

42:19.121 --> 42:21.658
Oh, we could go to that
little, uh, Italian place.

42:21.873 --> 42:24.615
I'm thinking take out.

42:24.835 --> 42:27.451
Looks like it's going to storm.

42:27.671 --> 42:35.794
hhundeﬂ

42:36.012 --> 42:41.006
[ending theme]
