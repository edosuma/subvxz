00:40.998 --> 00:45.998
People might laugh
and say it's just a fairy tale.

00:46.461 --> 00:51.461
That these mysterious things
couldn't really happen.

01:28.670 --> 01:33.670
But this is the true story of my mother.

01:36.220 --> 01:39.222
The man that Mother loved...

01:39.223 --> 01:44.223
...was a wolf man.

02:05.916 --> 02:10.916
Mother was a student at
a university just outside of Tokyo.

02:11.505 --> 02:16.505
--Her tuition was paid for with
scholarships --This is what Socrates said:

02:20.889 --> 02:25.889
..."The wise men of the world
may have great knowledge of many things--

02:28.939 --> 02:33.939
but goodness, truth, beauty, and arete..."

02:34.111 --> 02:35.695
One day in early summer,

02:35.696 --> 02:38.906
Mother saw Father for the
first time at the university.

02:38.907 --> 02:42.702
Wearing a shirt with a stretched-out
collar, using no textbook--

02:42.703 --> 02:46.038
Mother said he was completely
different from the other students

02:46.039 --> 02:51.039
as she watched him
from behind earnestly taking notes.

03:11.064 --> 03:16.064
Please wait.

03:17.070 --> 03:22.033
This is the attendance sheet. If you don't
turn it in, you'll be marked absent.

03:22.034 --> 03:23.993
--So--
--I'm...

03:23.994 --> 03:25.578
...not a student here.

03:25.579 --> 03:26.662
What?

03:26.663 --> 03:31.663
If that bothers you, I won't come anymore.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.999
Please, wait!

04:12.000 --> 04:14.877
I don't care if you are a student or not,

04:14.878 --> 04:19.839
but the lecture can be hard
to understand without a textbook.

04:19.841 --> 04:24.841
Do you want to share mine?

04:31.353 --> 04:36.353
"Hokushin Dry Cleaners"

04:39.277 --> 04:44.277
Thank you for waiting.

05:36.626 --> 05:40.004
I'll put this here, then.

05:40.005 --> 05:45.005
I'll take this.

05:51.308 --> 05:54.018
Here, thank you.

05:54.019 --> 05:58.022
The accusers in this case
were the poet Meletus,

05:58.023 --> 06:03.023
the politically powerful Anytus,
and the sophist Lycon.

06:04.112 --> 06:06.197
Meletus acted as their representative,

06:06.198 --> 06:11.198
but Anytus is said to have
pulled the strings from behind.

06:32.140 --> 06:36.977
What do you think is fun?
What kind of food do you like?

06:36.978 --> 06:41.978
What were the people you loved
in the past like?

06:42.234 --> 06:44.944
Why are you called "Hana"?

06:44.945 --> 06:46.111
My name?

06:46.112 --> 06:47.947
Yeah.

06:47.948 --> 06:52.243
When I was born,
cosmos were blooming in the garden.

06:52.244 --> 06:55.704
They hadn't been planted by anyone,
but grew there naturally.

06:55.705 --> 06:58.916
My dad said that looking at them
made him think of my name.

06:58.917 --> 07:02.878
He wanted me to be a child
who always smiled, like the flowers.

07:02.879 --> 07:04.964
Even when things got hard,

07:04.965 --> 07:07.967
to just keep smiling,
even if the smile became forced.

07:07.968 --> 07:12.968
Because then I could
overcome most things, he said.

07:15.141 --> 07:19.853
That's why during Dad's funeral,
I was smiling the whole time.

07:19.854 --> 07:24.854
But then, my relatives said that was
improper, and they were very angry with me.

07:27.696 --> 07:32.283
But... I suppose
it really was improper, wasn't it?

07:32.284 --> 07:37.284
It wasn't improper.

07:37.414 --> 07:38.026
I'm glad.

Even in the same housing complex,
each room is completely different inside.

08:10.071 --> 08:15.071
Families with money, poor families,
big families, people living alone,

08:17.162 --> 08:22.162
families with babies,
elderly living alone...

08:31.885 --> 08:34.970
I bet it'd be nice to have my own house.

08:34.971 --> 08:39.971
To say, "I'm home" and take off my shoes, wash
my face and hands, and sink into a chair.

08:42.187 --> 08:44.020
That'd be nice.

08:44.022 --> 08:45.606
I'd build a bookcase.

08:45.607 --> 08:49.610
And once that bookcase was full of books,
I'd build a new bookcase.

08:49.611 --> 08:54.611
I'd be able to do whatever I wanted
because it'd be my own house.

08:58.244 --> 09:03.244
Then, I'll say "Welcome home," if you want.

09:12.258 --> 09:13.926
Hana.

09:13.927 --> 09:16.011
What is it?

09:16.012 --> 09:19.515
There's something I have to tell you.

09:19.516 --> 09:21.392
You can tell me anything.

09:21.393 --> 09:26.393
Actually--

09:32.654 --> 09:34.530
I'll tell you tomorrow.

10:44.684 --> 10:48.187
I'm sorry, Hana.

10:48.188 --> 10:53.188
I'm sorry.

10:57.447 --> 11:00.908
I've never told anyone before.

11:00.909 --> 11:02.576
I was scared.

11:02.577 --> 11:07.577
I was afraid you'd leave if I told you,
but I should have told you sooner.

11:08.792 --> 11:11.210
I should have <i>shown</i> you.

11:11.211 --> 11:12.503
Shown me?

11:12.504 --> 11:17.504
Close your eyes for a second.

11:21.012 --> 11:26.012
For longer than that.

11:29.979 --> 11:34.979
Can I open them yet?

12:01.135 --> 12:04.054
Hana,

12:04.055 --> 12:09.055
what do I look like to you?

12:11.396 --> 12:13.897
She found out that
transforming during the full moon

12:13.898 --> 12:18.569
and attacking people was just a legend.

12:18.570 --> 12:23.570
"The world is full of things
I don't know," Mother thought.

12:28.037 --> 12:30.581
Were you surprised?

12:30.582 --> 12:33.750
Will you leave me now?

12:33.751 --> 12:35.586
But you're shaking.

12:35.587 --> 12:37.045
Are you afraid?

12:37.046 --> 12:40.507
I'm not afraid.

12:40.508 --> 12:45.508
Because it's you.

12:54.105 --> 12:57.733
Father was a descendant
of the Honshuu wolf,

12:57.734 --> 13:00.903
which had become extinct
about a hundred years ago.

13:00.904 --> 13:05.904
With both wolf and human blood,
he was the last of his kind.

13:06.868 --> 13:11.868
When Father was a child, his parents told him
about the history of his extinct ancestors.

13:12.916 --> 13:17.502
They told him not to reveal the truth
to anyone, and then died.

13:17.503 --> 13:20.923
After that, he was taken in
by relatives who knew nothing of this

13:20.924 --> 13:24.301
and had a hard time as
he grew into an adult.

13:24.302 --> 13:29.302
After getting his driver's license,
he went to the city to look for work.

13:29.432 --> 13:34.432
Unknown and unheeded by men, Father said
that he had lived in hiding until now.

"Natural Birth: Kind to your body and soul"

15:40.188 --> 15:45.188
"Hakuiuji"

17:30.715 --> 17:35.302
Mother gave birth to me
in that small apartment.

17:35.303 --> 17:37.179
It was snowing.

17:37.180 --> 17:40.640
Not at the hospital,
without even a midwife,

17:40.641 --> 17:43.143
my parents delivered me by themselves.

17:43.144 --> 17:46.396
Mother was worried that
if I had been born as a wolf,

17:46.397 --> 17:51.397
the doctors would have been surprised.

17:56.407 --> 17:59.117
I'm glad she was born safely.

17:59.118 --> 18:02.787
This is just the beginning.

18:02.788 --> 18:04.998
Do you think she will be a kind child?

18:04.999 --> 18:07.584
She might be a smart kid.

18:07.585 --> 18:10.003
I wonder what kind of adult she will be?

18:10.004 --> 18:13.340
A nurse, a teacher, or a baker--

18:13.341 --> 18:15.842
whatever it is, I want her
to have a job she loves.

18:15.843 --> 18:19.930
I want her to have a happy,
healthy life free of troubles.

18:19.931 --> 18:23.808
Let's watch over her until she grows up.

18:23.809 --> 18:24.309
Yeah.

18:40.826 --> 18:45.038
My little brother was born
in the spring of the next year.

18:45.039 --> 18:48.291
It was raining that day.

18:48.292 --> 18:53.292
Suddenly, Father was nowhere to be seen.

19:39.010 --> 19:44.010
I don't know what Father
was thinking that day.

19:44.307 --> 19:48.810
Maybe he instinctively went
to hunt for food for his new baby.

19:48.811 --> 19:51.229
Maybe he wanted
something nutritious for Mother,

19:51.230 --> 19:56.230
who was recovering from the birth.

21:51.976 --> 21:56.438
"Driver's License"

21:56.439 --> 22:01.439
"I'm leaving the kids to you,"
Mother thought she could hear him say.

22:07.825 --> 22:12.825
Leave them to me.
I'll make sure to raise them properly.

22:22.965 --> 22:27.965
Mother had a lot of trouble with us after
that, but I don't remember anything about it.

22:28.512 --> 22:29.512
Num nums.

22:29.513 --> 22:32.098
Wait a minute, Yuki. I'm making it now.

22:32.099 --> 22:32.932
Num nums!

22:32.933 --> 22:34.017
I said, it's almost done.

22:34.018 --> 22:34.893
Num nums!

22:34.894 --> 22:37.979
Yuki!

22:37.980 --> 22:39.856
When I was angry or upset,

22:39.857 --> 22:43.234
my fur would bristle,
and I would turn into a wolf.

22:43.235 --> 22:48.235
Oh all right, you can have a biscuit first.

22:53.704 --> 22:55.246
Apparently, I was always hungry,

22:55.247 --> 23:00.084
crying for food from morning until night.

23:00.085 --> 23:05.085
Completely different from
my sickly brother, Ame, who ate little.

23:06.091 --> 23:09.093
Mother had to quit school
and leave her part-time job

23:09.094 --> 23:12.931
in order to take care of us.

23:12.932 --> 23:15.183
That was close...

23:15.184 --> 23:20.184
We lived on the small savings
Father had left behind.

23:29.657 --> 23:31.908
That was close...

23:31.909 --> 23:36.496
According to Mother, my brother
and I seemed like we weren't sure

23:36.497 --> 23:41.497
if we were supposed to be humans or wolves.

23:46.507 --> 23:50.051
"Pediatric Care"

23:50.052 --> 23:54.180
They got me...

23:54.181 --> 23:58.309
"Child Care Encyclopedia"

23:58.310 --> 24:02.564
she had no choice but to study on her own.

24:02.565 --> 24:05.358
Breastfeeding every two
hours, day and night.

24:05.359 --> 24:07.944
When Ame wouldn't suck on his own,

24:07.945 --> 24:12.945
she learned to feed him
with cotton pads dipped in breast milk.

24:22.293 --> 24:25.628
But when he wouldn't
drink any milk or stop crying,

24:25.629 --> 24:27.547
she didn't know what to do

24:27.548 --> 24:32.548
except pat him on the back
and comfort him the whole night.

24:33.596 --> 24:38.596
As a result, Mother was
quickly becoming exhausted.

24:44.064 --> 24:46.107
I'm okay.

24:46.108 --> 24:48.318
Thanks to this, even if it
was just for a short time,

24:48.319 --> 24:53.319
she could fall asleep at a moment's notice.

24:53.449 --> 24:55.074
Mommy?

24:55.075 --> 24:59.495
What is it?

24:59.496 --> 25:02.874
What really caused problems
was when we got sick.

25:02.875 --> 25:05.918
Yuki?

25:05.919 --> 25:07.629
Yuki?

25:07.630 --> 25:08.130
Yuki--!

25:19.058 --> 25:23.478
The pediatrician or the veterinarian--
she didn't know which one to take us to.

25:23.479 --> 25:26.939
My daughter swallowed
some desiccant by mistake--

25:26.940 --> 25:28.191
She's two years old.

25:28.192 --> 25:31.694
Yes, she threw up.
There was no blood.

25:31.695 --> 25:36.695
It says "silica gel" on it.
Um, is it dangerous...?

25:37.117 --> 25:40.203
What? Her appetite?

25:40.204 --> 25:43.122
I'm hungry!

25:43.123 --> 25:46.626
Is that so? She's okay?

25:46.627 --> 25:51.627
She regretted not asking Father
about how he was raised as a child.

25:52.883 --> 25:53.841
I wanna go for a walk.

25:53.842 --> 25:54.842
Yuki, that's--

25:54.843 --> 25:55.927
Walk!

25:55.928 --> 25:59.138
You were sick just a little while ago. So--

25:59.139 --> 26:00.056
Walk!

26:00.057 --> 26:05.057
Okay, okay.
Now, put your ears away.

26:06.689 --> 26:10.149
Okay, let's go for a walk!

26:10.150 --> 26:14.737
I said, put your ears away!

26:14.738 --> 26:15.238
Okay!

26:36.301 --> 26:38.302
Hello. Aw, how cute.

26:38.303 --> 26:43.303
He said you're cute. Isn't that nice?

26:45.227 --> 26:46.602
Oh, sorry!

26:46.603 --> 26:51.603
It's okay.

26:55.404 --> 27:00.404
But that wasn't the only problem.

27:04.455 --> 27:08.875
What time do you think it is?!
Shut him up!

27:08.876 --> 27:09.792
I'm very sorry.

27:09.793 --> 27:12.920
You keep making such
a racket night after night!

27:12.921 --> 27:14.797
I'm really very sorry.

27:14.798 --> 27:19.798
At least discipline your kids properly--!

27:20.179 --> 27:25.179
Shh... It's okay.

27:42.534 --> 27:47.079
The contract said pets
are not allowed here, didn't it?

27:47.080 --> 27:48.164
I don't have any pets.

27:48.165 --> 27:51.834
Don't lie to me.
I know what's going on.

27:51.835 --> 27:54.003
If you think you can do whatever you want,

27:54.004 --> 27:59.004
then I'll have no choice
but to have you go elsewhere.

28:00.761 --> 28:02.136
You're caseworkers?

28:02.137 --> 28:06.599
Yes, we have some serious
misgivings about your children.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.392
What do you mean?

28:08.393 --> 28:13.393
Our records show that they've
never had regular checkups or vaccines.

28:14.066 --> 28:16.776
It's all right. They're healthy.

28:16.777 --> 28:20.780
If that's the case, can
we at least see them?

28:20.781 --> 28:22.031
No, that's--

28:22.032 --> 28:23.157
Just a look will do.

28:23.158 --> 28:26.494
We just want to see if
what you're saying is true or not.

28:26.495 --> 28:28.037
You're not welcome--

28:28.038 --> 28:32.166
If you don't let us in, you could
be suspected of abuse or neglect!

28:32.167 --> 28:37.167
Please, leave!

29:14.751 --> 29:16.544
Hey--

29:16.545 --> 29:18.337
What is it, Mommy?

29:18.338 --> 29:21.007
What do you want to do from now on?

29:21.008 --> 29:24.135
Do you want to be human, or wolf?

29:24.136 --> 29:27.763
Huh?

29:27.764 --> 29:31.142
I'm thinking of moving.

29:31.143 --> 29:36.143
So that you can choose
whichever one you want.

29:53.332 --> 29:55.833
Ever since the town hall
started presenting unoccupied houses,

29:55.834 --> 29:59.045
people who want to live
in the country have been coming steadily,

29:59.046 --> 30:01.297
but they never last long.

30:01.298 --> 30:03.883
As you can see, there's nothing here.

30:03.884 --> 30:06.677
The elementary school and hospital
are both thirty minutes away by car.

30:06.678 --> 30:10.264
The junior high is two and a half hours
by bus and train, one way.

30:10.265 --> 30:11.849
That's five hours round trip!

30:11.850 --> 30:16.850
No matter how much you want to raise
your children in a good environment--

30:17.189 --> 30:22.189
The town is a lot more convenient,
in my opinion.

30:34.122 --> 30:36.290
Wow...

30:36.291 --> 30:38.334
It's so big...

30:38.335 --> 30:41.170
And I know the rent is practically free,

30:41.171 --> 30:43.839
but you know, the cost of repairs
is nothing to laugh at.

30:43.840 --> 30:48.135
Instead of calling it an unoccupied house--
oh, you can keep your shoes on--

30:48.136 --> 30:51.639
--it's more like an abandoned house.

30:51.640 --> 30:56.310
But at least there's electricity,
and the mountain stream isn't dried out,

30:56.311 --> 30:58.187
and they said you could use
whatever is in the shed.

30:58.188 --> 31:00.064
That's a field, isn't it?

31:00.065 --> 31:02.984
Oh, this place isn't really suitable
for growing your own food.

31:02.985 --> 31:06.112
Animals come down from the mountains
and damage the crops.

31:06.113 --> 31:09.240
Even if you make the effort
to grow vegetables, they'll all get eaten.

31:09.241 --> 31:13.536
This place is full of unoccupied houses
because the humans are getting kicked out.

31:13.537 --> 31:15.329
Then, the neighbors are--?

31:15.330 --> 31:20.330
Neighbors? There isn't anyone around for miles.
Shall we look at a different place?

31:21.878 --> 31:23.671
There might be a better
place near the village...

31:23.672 --> 31:24.588
I've decided.

31:24.589 --> 31:25.631
What?

31:25.632 --> 31:29.051
I've decided on this place.

31:29.052 --> 31:29.927
Why?

31:29.928 --> 31:32.179
Wow! What is this place?

31:32.180 --> 31:37.180
Our new home.

31:44.067 --> 31:44.900
Oopsie daisy!

31:44.901 --> 31:49.901
It's slanted!

31:50.407 --> 31:54.326
Oh, hello Mr. Ant!

31:54.327 --> 31:59.327
Wow, what's this?!

32:02.461 --> 32:07.461
Stomp! Stomp!

32:15.098 --> 32:17.308
How is it? Do you like it?

32:17.309 --> 32:19.268
I like it!

32:19.269 --> 32:24.269
I want to go home.

32:27.819 --> 32:31.363
She said she wanted a place
with no neighbors close by.

32:31.364 --> 32:33.908
She was a little different,
if you know what I mean.

32:33.909 --> 32:34.825
What about her husband?

32:34.826 --> 32:35.576
I don't know...

32:35.577 --> 32:36.660
Her income?

32:36.661 --> 32:37.453
I'm not sure...

32:37.454 --> 32:40.122
Then how does she expect
to take care of her kids?

32:40.123 --> 32:45.123
Oh, Grandpa Nirasaki!
We'll be in your care from now on.

33:37.973 --> 33:40.141
Look, look! Mommy, look!

33:40.142 --> 33:40.642
Tada--!

33:46.314 --> 33:48.816
Come here, birdie--

33:48.817 --> 33:53.817
C'mon, come here--

34:14.592 --> 34:19.592
"Yuki - Age 5"
"Ame - Age 4"

34:53.924 --> 34:55.507
Thank you very much.

34:55.507 --> 35:00.508
Thank you.

35:02.307 --> 35:03.682
Good evening.

35:03.683 --> 35:06.435
Good evening.

35:06.436 --> 35:11.436
Hey, wait, is that her?

35:16.696 --> 35:21.696
Let's go--

35:31.836 --> 35:34.797
Smash!

35:34.798 --> 35:37.174
I guess we'll have to be
more frugal from now on.

35:37.175 --> 35:38.926
Frugal?

35:38.927 --> 35:43.927
I was just thinking that we should at least
be able to grow our own vegetables.

35:44.516 --> 35:47.935
I'll help!

35:47.936 --> 35:49.103
Wait here, okay?

35:49.104 --> 35:51.772
Okay.

35:51.773 --> 35:55.025
"Home Garden"

35:55.026 --> 35:55.901
These please.

35:55.902 --> 35:57.069
Okay.

35:57.070 --> 36:02.070
These, too.

36:02.367 --> 36:06.912
It's our little secret that
you two are wolf children.

36:06.913 --> 36:08.038
Right.

36:08.039 --> 36:12.126
If you were to suddenly become wolves,
everyone would be very surprised.

36:12.127 --> 36:15.421
So you cannot become wolves
in front of other people.

36:15.422 --> 36:16.880
Promise?

36:16.881 --> 36:18.424
Promise!

36:18.425 --> 36:20.217
And one more thing.

36:20.218 --> 36:24.054
If you meet other animals in the mountains,
you can't act like you are better than them.

36:24.055 --> 36:25.431
Why not?

36:25.432 --> 36:27.933
Because Daddy will feel sad about it.

36:27.934 --> 36:29.601
Okay?

36:29.602 --> 36:31.520
Okay!

36:31.521 --> 36:33.564
"'We'll never forgive you!' The angry
villagers chased after the wolf with guns."

36:33.565 --> 36:38.565
"'I'm sorry! I won't do it again, '
the boastful wolf cried as he ran away."

37:02.510 --> 37:04.511
Oh no!

37:04.512 --> 37:05.637
Why?

37:05.638 --> 37:10.638
I don't know. I wonder what happened...

37:11.019 --> 37:13.228
Hello? Excuse me!

37:13.229 --> 37:14.563
What?

37:14.564 --> 37:17.816
Is it okay if I take
the fallen leaves from the woods?

37:17.817 --> 37:19.568
What did you say?

37:19.569 --> 37:21.195
The fallen leaves!

37:21.196 --> 37:24.907
No one would ask
for permission to take that stuff!

37:24.908 --> 37:29.078
Thank you very much!

37:29.079 --> 37:30.704
I wonder how long she'll last.

37:30.705 --> 37:34.833
She'll start talking about convenience
stores and karaoke soon enough.

37:34.834 --> 37:39.834
You got that right.

37:50.183 --> 37:52.059
I'll get it right this time...

37:52.060 --> 37:53.852
Mom... my...

37:53.853 --> 37:55.437
What?

37:55.438 --> 37:56.230
Ame!

37:56.231 --> 37:57.356
What happened?

37:57.357 --> 37:58.607
You calico cat!

37:58.608 --> 38:01.652
You're weak even though you're a wolf,
so they've got it in for you.

38:01.653 --> 38:03.695
They're just scratches.
Nothing to worry about.

38:03.696 --> 38:05.489
You won't be able to survive like that!

38:05.490 --> 38:06.323
Yuki.

38:06.324 --> 38:08.450
Do the "all better" thing.

38:08.451 --> 38:10.160
All better, all better.

38:10.161 --> 38:12.788
I wouldn't lose to a wild boar!

38:12.789 --> 38:13.997
You saw a wild boar?

38:13.998 --> 38:18.335
Yup, and a monkey and a serow.
But I wasn't scared at all.

38:18.336 --> 38:20.838
It was fun when they ran away
when I chased them.

38:20.839 --> 38:21.505
And--

38:21.506 --> 38:22.673
Yuki.

38:22.674 --> 38:24.508
And then when I peed--

38:24.509 --> 38:25.884
Do you remember your promise?

38:25.885 --> 38:28.720
That you wouldn't act like
you were better than the other animals?

38:28.721 --> 38:29.513
But--

38:29.514 --> 38:33.142
Please.

38:33.143 --> 38:36.019
Fine.

38:36.020 --> 38:36.895
Thank you.

38:36.896 --> 38:40.858
Do the "all better" thing again.

38:40.859 --> 38:45.362
All better, all better.

38:45.363 --> 38:50.363
But, how do wolf children
become adults, anyway?

38:54.706 --> 38:56.331
Yuki, wait!

38:56.332 --> 38:57.332
Piggyback.

38:57.333 --> 38:58.417
Already?

38:58.418 --> 39:01.628
You're too slow! Hurry up!

39:01.629 --> 39:06.091
"Wolves start learning to hunt
at around four months old.

39:06.092 --> 39:09.595
First, they learn what hunting is
with mice and other small animals.

39:09.596 --> 39:13.098
As they get older,
they form teams with adult wolves..."

39:13.099 --> 39:13.849
We're a team!

39:13.850 --> 39:15.184
No, we're not.

39:15.185 --> 39:20.063
Fine, be that way.

39:20.064 --> 39:21.899
Don't go too far!

39:21.900 --> 39:24.693
I know!

39:24.694 --> 39:26.236
Let's go home...

39:26.237 --> 39:31.237
Ame, I wonder if this
wild grass is edible... Let's see...

39:47.550 --> 39:48.162
I got it!

39:55.433 --> 39:55.933
Got it!

40:02.607 --> 40:07.607
Oh, look at that, Ame!

40:14.118 --> 40:16.245
All better, all better.

40:16.246 --> 40:20.457
Mommy, look at this! It's a cormorant!
There was a stream over there, and...

40:20.458 --> 40:23.001
Shh...

40:23.002 --> 40:24.044
Mommy...

40:24.045 --> 40:25.420
Hmm?

40:25.421 --> 40:29.216
Why is the wolf always the bad guy?

40:29.217 --> 40:32.344
You mean, in the picture books?

40:32.345 --> 40:36.682
Everyone hates them,
and they're always killed in the end...

40:36.683 --> 40:41.683
If that's the case,
I don't want to be a wolf.

40:43.439 --> 40:48.439
You're right. But you know,
Mommy likes wolves.

40:49.612 --> 40:54.612
Even if everyone else hates the wolf,
I'll take the wolf's side.

41:03.876 --> 41:07.421
Mommy! Mommy!

41:07.422 --> 41:08.422
What's wrong?

41:08.423 --> 41:09.631
They wilted again.

41:09.632 --> 41:10.132
What?

41:15.430 --> 41:19.641
Diseased... All of them? Don't tell me...

41:19.642 --> 41:21.852
Mommy...

41:21.853 --> 41:26.853
What's going to happen to us now?

41:28.985 --> 41:32.821
Mommy's no good like this.
I've got to learn more!

41:32.822 --> 41:35.741
Will you help me again?

41:35.742 --> 41:37.117
Sure.

41:37.118 --> 41:37.618
Thanks.

41:41.873 --> 41:42.873
Go inside.

41:42.874 --> 41:44.875
Okay.

41:44.876 --> 41:46.585
Hello!

41:46.586 --> 41:50.797
I was going to visit earlier,
but it got so busy around here...

41:50.798 --> 41:53.800
It's hard to grow your own food, isn't it?

41:53.801 --> 41:57.304
Even when I do what it says in the book,
I keep messing up.

41:57.305 --> 42:01.558
But this is a nice place, isn't it?
With nature all around us.

42:01.559 --> 42:03.310
Nature, ha!

42:03.311 --> 42:06.438
Plants don't grow overnight, you know.

42:06.439 --> 42:07.439
Huh?

42:07.440 --> 42:10.275
At this rate, it'll be the same
no matter how many times you try.

42:10.276 --> 42:12.110
Isn't that what you think?

42:12.111 --> 42:14.196
T-That's...

42:14.197 --> 42:17.366
Don't smile! Why do you smile?

42:17.367 --> 42:22.367
Even if you smile,
you won't be able to do anything.

42:35.468 --> 42:38.178
That person's scary.

42:38.179 --> 42:42.641
No, it's Mommy's fault
for not knowing anything.

42:42.642 --> 42:46.978
Even though you're an adult?

42:46.979 --> 42:51.979
I should have asked
your Daddy about more things.

43:02.120 --> 43:04.079
It's raining cats and dogs!

43:04.080 --> 43:05.580
Hello...

43:05.581 --> 43:06.873
Um...

43:06.874 --> 43:08.500
Here, this is for you.

43:08.501 --> 43:09.584
What are they?

43:09.585 --> 43:11.044
Seed potatoes.

43:11.045 --> 43:14.548
You mean the ones you plant in the fields?

43:14.549 --> 43:17.509
Is there anything else
you can do with them?

43:17.510 --> 43:21.513
Don't worry about what Dad said.
That's just how he is.

43:21.514 --> 43:26.184
No, it was my fault.

43:26.185 --> 43:29.104
Hello!

43:29.105 --> 43:30.397
Sorry.

43:30.398 --> 43:33.316
Don't worry about it.

43:33.317 --> 43:33.817
Here.

43:40.533 --> 43:44.619
Grandpa Nirasaki,
thank you for the seed potatoes.

43:44.620 --> 43:49.620
Ah, are you trying to let them go to waste?

43:53.796 --> 43:58.796
You have to start over from the soil.

44:03.681 --> 44:06.141
You won't get anything
done hoeing like that.

44:06.142 --> 44:11.142
I'm sorry...

44:17.779 --> 44:19.738
Um, what about the fertilizer...?

44:19.739 --> 44:21.656
Did you use leaves when
you prepared the soil?

44:21.657 --> 44:22.407
Yes.

44:22.408 --> 44:27.408
Then you don't need fertilizer.

44:34.003 --> 44:36.338
When you're done, clear this field, too.

44:36.339 --> 44:41.339
I don't need such a big field. I just
need to grow enough for my kids and me.

44:43.513 --> 44:48.266
Did you hear me?

44:48.267 --> 44:48.767
Yes...

45:10.790 --> 45:14.501
Make ridges in the soil.

45:14.502 --> 45:18.255
Okay.

45:18.256 --> 45:20.382
Leave more space in between.

45:20.383 --> 45:24.010
Okay.

45:24.011 --> 45:26.054
That's too low. Make them higher.

45:26.055 --> 45:26.555
Okay.

46:07.513 --> 46:12.513
In a week, plant them cut-side down.
Don't water them. Just leave them!

46:14.520 --> 46:19.520
Um, thank you for teaching me how to...

46:35.541 --> 46:40.541
Mommy, are you okay?

46:45.676 --> 46:49.095
Ow...

46:49.096 --> 46:50.388
Hello!

46:50.389 --> 46:51.598
Come with us.

46:51.599 --> 46:52.140
Huh?

46:52.141 --> 46:54.142
It's okay, just come.

46:54.143 --> 46:54.559
What?

46:54.560 --> 46:59.560
Come on, let's go.

47:01.150 --> 47:02.359
Hey--

47:02.360 --> 47:03.985
Yes?

47:03.986 --> 47:05.904
If you plant chamomile
and cabbage together,

47:05.905 --> 47:08.448
bugs won't attack
and the flavors will be better.

47:08.449 --> 47:11.576
No, you want celery with your cabbage.

47:11.577 --> 47:14.162
No, no, it's better for
novices to use this.

47:14.163 --> 47:15.372
NO, no! no!

47:15.373 --> 47:18.124
You can't fill up a stomach on chamomile.

47:18.125 --> 47:20.877
You should plant them shallowly like this.

47:20.878 --> 47:23.880
No, you should water the hole
before you put anything in.

47:23.881 --> 47:27.092
No, no, you can water them later.
Plant them first.

47:27.093 --> 47:28.843
No, no, you're wrong.

47:28.844 --> 47:31.221
You should just sprinkle
the extra fertilizer like this.

47:31.222 --> 47:33.598
If you put too much,
it'll just bring more bugs.

47:33.599 --> 47:36.309
No, give me that. You have to pile it on.

47:36.310 --> 47:38.478
No, you only need a little.

47:38.479 --> 47:40.814
If you do what this guy says,
you'll definitely fail.

47:40.815 --> 47:41.690
That's you!

47:41.691 --> 47:42.482
What?!

47:42.483 --> 47:45.443
What did you say?!

47:45.444 --> 47:46.903
Wood vinegar?

47:46.904 --> 47:49.239
It's made from the smoke
when charcoal is produced.

47:49.240 --> 47:51.992
And poultry manure.
There are instructions inside.

47:51.993 --> 47:54.077
Thank you for coming all this way to help.

47:54.078 --> 47:55.120
No, no.

47:55.121 --> 47:57.831
Sorry about showing up
without warning like this.

47:57.832 --> 47:58.707
It's no problem.

47:58.708 --> 48:01.167
It's hard working the land
if you're not used to it, isn't it?

48:01.168 --> 48:04.170
I still have a lot I have to learn.

48:04.171 --> 48:06.089
There are a lot of city folks
who get discouraged

48:06.090 --> 48:08.550
and leave right after moving here.

48:08.551 --> 48:10.093
Other young people...?

48:10.094 --> 48:15.094
Oh no, these were retired old men. It was
hilarious how weak they were mentally.

48:18.310 --> 48:23.310
I don't know if it means anything if I say it, but
this isn't an easy place to live off the land.

48:23.315 --> 48:24.941
The drainage isn't very good.

48:24.942 --> 48:26.651
And we get a lot of snow.

48:26.652 --> 48:31.239
We have to help each other.

48:31.240 --> 48:34.117
We thought you didn't want
anything to do with the neighbors.

48:34.118 --> 48:38.747
There are only a few young mothers around,
so it's nice to have someone else around.

48:38.748 --> 48:40.165
Let us know if you have any questions.

48:40.166 --> 48:42.375
Then“.

48:42.376 --> 48:44.794
What? You're living off your savings?

48:44.795 --> 48:46.796
But I need to start working soon.

48:46.797 --> 48:49.799
It's hard to find work around here.

48:49.800 --> 48:53.636
Everyone leaves their kids
at the preschool and commutes to work.

48:53.637 --> 48:55.972
Right?

48:55.973 --> 48:57.974
What's a preschool?

48:57.975 --> 48:58.558
What?

48:58.559 --> 49:00.518
Why don't Ame and I go?

49:00.519 --> 49:03.354
--Well, that's because...
--I want to go to preschool, too!

49:03.355 --> 49:03.897
No.

49:03.898 --> 49:04.481
I wanna go!

49:04.482 --> 49:05.023
No!

49:05.024 --> 49:10.024
I wanna go I wanna go I wanna go...!

49:10.863 --> 49:12.030
I wanna go!

49:12.031 --> 49:16.034
I wanna go to the preschool...!

49:16.035 --> 49:18.161
Yuki, hurry up and finish your food.

49:18.162 --> 49:20.997
I know it's supposed to be a secret...

49:20.998 --> 49:23.374
...but I can stay human.

49:23.375 --> 49:25.126
But you know...

49:25.127 --> 49:30.127
I can do it...

49:35.554 --> 49:37.806
Y-Yuki...!

49:37.807 --> 49:40.100
Hana, did you get a dog?

49:40.101 --> 49:43.103
Um, yeah...

49:43.104 --> 49:45.063
Isn't that a wolf?

49:45.064 --> 49:47.941
--What? N-No, that's...
--isn't it, dear?

49:47.942 --> 49:48.983
Don't be stupid!

49:48.984 --> 49:53.279
There are no wolves in Japan anymore. That's
a shepherd mixed with something else.

49:53.280 --> 49:56.199
Right, Hana? Am I right? Am I right?

49:56.200 --> 49:58.034
Oh? The dog's gone.

49:58.035 --> 50:00.161
Hello, Mrs. Nirasaki!

50:00.162 --> 50:03.039
Oh hello, Yuki. Aren't you friendly today.

50:03.040 --> 50:05.917
Oh, you and the dog have matching clothes!

50:05.918 --> 50:08.378
That's cute.

50:08.379 --> 50:13.379
Yu... Yuki...

50:15.719 --> 50:20.719
What's wrong, Hana?

50:39.118 --> 50:42.245
Hello?

50:42.246 --> 50:42.746
Hello!

50:50.087 --> 50:53.256
I wonder where Grandpa Nirasaki is...

50:53.257 --> 50:55.383
Oh, these grew nicely.

50:55.384 --> 50:56.634
It was thanks to everyone's help.

50:56.635 --> 50:59.721
Ours were destroyed, so
this'll really help.

50:59.722 --> 51:01.097
Destroyed? By what?

51:01.098 --> 51:02.307
By a wild boar.

51:02.308 --> 51:03.641
Here, take this.

51:03.642 --> 51:05.185
This much--?

51:05.186 --> 51:06.561
The boar, that bastard...

51:06.562 --> 51:09.105
Oh, thank you for bringing this.

51:09.106 --> 51:12.650
It came and dug everything up
without making a sound.

51:12.651 --> 51:15.862
It came all the way down
to Sakai's fields this year.

51:15.863 --> 51:18.323
Here, take this in return.
Watch out, it's heavy.

51:18.324 --> 51:21.910
The only fields with
no animal damage are yours, Hana.

51:21.911 --> 51:24.204
It's strange, even though
you're so deep in the mountains.

51:24.205 --> 51:25.955
Do you have some kind of trick?

51:25.956 --> 51:27.415
No, I don't...

51:27.416 --> 51:29.417
Everyone wants to know how you did it.

51:29.418 --> 51:30.960
What's a trick?

51:30.961 --> 51:32.337
I need to pee!

51:32.338 --> 51:35.882
Yuki's a lively child, isn't she?

51:35.883 --> 51:37.091
Could it be...?

51:37.092 --> 51:38.426
What is it?

51:38.427 --> 51:41.054
Oh, no, never mind.

51:41.055 --> 51:43.473
Wow, thank you very much.

51:43.474 --> 51:44.182
Don't mention it.

51:44.183 --> 51:45.600
Thanks for the potatoes.

51:45.601 --> 51:47.101
It's been a while since we had eggs.

51:47.102 --> 51:48.561
I'm glad to help.

51:48.562 --> 51:50.605
Let me know when you run out!

51:50.606 --> 51:53.858
Oh my, isn't that cute!

51:53.859 --> 51:55.318
Hmm?

51:55.319 --> 51:56.527
What?

51:56.528 --> 51:57.487
Ready, lift.

51:57.488 --> 51:59.822
Oh, you don't have to give us
something so big...

51:59.823 --> 52:01.699
Don't worry about it.

52:01.700 --> 52:03.618
It was just sitting in the storage shed.

52:03.619 --> 52:04.953
But--

52:04.954 --> 52:08.748
Please take it. If we bring it
back, Gramps'll get mad at us.

52:08.749 --> 52:10.166
Grandpa Nirasaki?

52:10.167 --> 52:12.585
He's always talking about you, Hana.

52:12.586 --> 52:13.670
Because he's fallen for her.

52:13.671 --> 52:15.546
Come on, he's already ninety.

52:15.547 --> 52:18.800
But he even told everyone
to help her and everything.

52:18.801 --> 52:22.595
Idiot! He said not to say anything
about that, remember?!

52:22.596 --> 52:27.596
So that's what it was...?

52:38.821 --> 52:43.821
I finally understand
why I needed a bigger field.

52:48.622 --> 52:50.081
I don't like it.

52:50.082 --> 52:51.332
What?

52:51.333 --> 52:56.333
Why are you always smiling and laughing?

52:58.716 --> 53:03.636
Don't laugh.

53:03.637 --> 53:08.637
What's so funny?

53:15.399 --> 53:20.399
We moved here trying
to get away from prying eyes...

53:20.487 --> 53:25.487
When did we end up in the care
of the people from the village?

53:26.243 --> 53:31.243
It was hard at first,
but I think we'll do fine here.

53:41.050 --> 53:46.050
Wow, look at that!

56:47.027 --> 56:48.986
M-Mommy--!

56:48.987 --> 56:50.947
Mommy--! Mom--

56:50.948 --> 56:51.572
Ame!

56:51.573 --> 56:54.575
Mom! Ame's fallen--!

56:54.576 --> 56:58.996
Mommy! Mommy--!

56:58.997 --> 57:01.499
Ame!

57:01.500 --> 57:05.711
Ame! Ame!

57:05.712 --> 57:07.797
Ame“!

57:07.798 --> 57:09.799
Mom... my...

57:09.800 --> 57:11.801
Ame!

57:11.802 --> 57:16.802
Mom... my...

57:27.859 --> 57:31.112
Ame... Ame!

57:31.113 --> 57:32.989
A-Ame!

57:32.990 --> 57:35.533
Open your eyes! Ame!

57:35.534 --> 57:37.243
Open your eyes!

57:37.244 --> 57:41.747
Ame, Ame, Ame...

57:41.748 --> 57:46.748
Open your eyes...

57:47.629 --> 57:50.256
Mommy... That's... too tight...

57:50.257 --> 57:51.924
Ame!!

57:51.925 --> 57:53.593
You know what?

57:53.594 --> 57:56.512
I found a crested kingfisher.

57:56.513 --> 58:01.513
It was a really nice-looking bird.
I felt like even I could catch it today.

58:03.478 --> 58:07.565
It was completely different
from how it usually feels.

58:07.566 --> 58:12.566
I wasn't scared. Suddenly,
I felt like I could do anything.

58:12.696 --> 58:16.657
So then, I--

58:16.658 --> 58:19.702
Why are you crying?

58:19.703 --> 58:24.703
What are we doing here?

58:27.628 --> 58:32.628
Mother said later that she had
never been more frightened in her life.

58:33.675 --> 58:38.675
After that incident, Ame seemed
like a completely different person.

58:42.142 --> 58:47.142
"Yuki - Age 6" "Ame
- Age 5" "Yuki - Age 5"

59:00.118 --> 59:01.243
However--

59:01.244 --> 59:02.703
No matter what happens--

59:02.704 --> 59:06.123
I won't turn into a wolf. I know already!

59:06.124 --> 59:06.874
Don't forget your promise!

59:06.875 --> 59:08.167
I'll be fine!

59:08.168 --> 59:10.670
Then remember,
"Piggy promise, promise kept."

59:10.671 --> 59:12.254
What's that?

59:12.255 --> 59:14.131
It's a charm to keep you
from becoming a wolf.

59:14.132 --> 59:15.508
A charm?

59:15.509 --> 59:18.719
♪ Piggy promise, promise kept.♪

59:18.720 --> 59:19.887
That's how you do it.

59:19.888 --> 59:20.971

59:20.972 --> 59:24.100
...promise, promise kept.

59:59.386 --> 01:00:01.887
It was the first time in my life

01:00:01.888 --> 01:00:04.890
that I had ever been surrounded
by so many people.

01:00:04.891 --> 01:00:07.017
--Don't push me!
--I had wanted to go so badly...

01:00:07.018 --> 01:00:09.645
--Stop pushing me!
--...but when it finally came down to it,

01:00:09.646 --> 01:00:14.646
I wasn't sure if I would be okay or not.

01:00:14.693 --> 01:00:19.693
But that was just at the beginning.

01:00:20.407 --> 01:00:21.991
Daddy, I'm off!

01:00:21.992 --> 01:00:23.993
I'm going now!

01:00:23.994 --> 01:00:26.162
Okay, be careful.

01:00:26.163 --> 01:00:26.663
I will!

01:00:32.043 --> 01:00:33.794
'Morning, Shino!

01:00:33.795 --> 01:00:34.962
Good morning, Yuki!

01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:36.422
I saved you a seat!

01:00:36.423 --> 01:00:37.590
Thanks!

"1st Grade"
"2nd Grade"

01:00:39.426 --> 01:00:41.427
Who knows the answer to this question?

01:00:41.428 --> 01:00:46.140
--I do!
--I do! I do! I do! I do! I do!

01:00:46.141 --> 01:00:48.559
No running in the halls!

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:53.560
--You can do it!
--Go, Yuki!

01:00:54.566 --> 01:00:56.567
Wow, Yuki!

01:00:56.568 --> 01:01:00.613
--You're so fast!
--You're amazing!

01:01:07.746 --> 01:01:10.372
This is...

01:01:10.373 --> 01:01:14.376
"Niikawa Nature Sanctuary"
"Nature Conservationist Assistant Wanted"

01:01:14.377 --> 01:01:19.377
"Hometown Nature"

01:01:22.344 --> 01:01:24.678
Thank you for waiting. Shall we go?

01:01:24.679 --> 01:01:27.389
My name is Tendo, and I
am a nature conservationist.

01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:30.059
Welcome to Niikawa Nature Sanctuary.

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.937
I look forward to working with you.

01:01:32.938 --> 01:01:37.608
A nature conservationist's job
is not just to protect nature.

01:01:37.609 --> 01:01:41.403
Environmental education, field surveys,
the conservation of plants and animals--

01:01:41.404 --> 01:01:45.991
These three pillars of conservancy are made
possible by the support of volunteers.

01:01:45.992 --> 01:01:49.578
We do many different types of work,
so while we are specialists,

01:01:49.579 --> 01:01:52.623
we also need to be able to do
a little of everything.

01:01:52.624 --> 01:01:57.624
So, we are looking for someone who can help
the conservationist with all the work, but...

01:01:59.923 --> 01:02:04.923
Honestly speaking, we can't pay very much.
We can pay enough to cover training expenses

01:02:06.054 --> 01:02:08.180
for someone studying
to become a conservationist,

01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:10.599
but we can't afford much more than that.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.186
A high schooler's part-time job
pays a lot more per hour.

01:02:14.187 --> 01:02:16.188
Even knowing all that...

01:02:16.189 --> 01:02:19.441
...do you still want to do it?

01:02:19.442 --> 01:02:24.442
Um... I heard that you have a wolf here...

01:02:27.242 --> 01:02:29.326
This is our timber wolf.

01:02:29.327 --> 01:02:30.953
He's very quiet.

01:02:30.954 --> 01:02:33.497
He's not that young anymore.

01:02:33.498 --> 01:02:35.583
Excuse me, Director--?

01:02:35.584 --> 01:02:40.584
Excuse me for a moment.

01:02:45.176 --> 01:02:49.054
Nice to meet you. I came
because I have something to ask you.

01:02:49.055 --> 01:02:51.056
He's a wolf's child.

01:02:51.057 --> 01:02:53.142
His father, the wolf, died.

01:02:53.143 --> 01:02:57.229
I'm his mother,
but I don't know how to raise a wolf.

01:02:57.230 --> 01:03:02.230
How did you learn the ways of the wolf?

01:03:03.403 --> 01:03:08.403
Will you tell us how
you were raised in the forest?

01:03:20.086 --> 01:03:23.380
Sorry about that.

01:03:23.381 --> 01:03:27.217
A wealthy person got
special permission to keep him as a pet,

01:03:27.218 --> 01:03:30.638
but when the owner died there was no one
to take him, so he came to live with us.

01:03:30.639 --> 01:03:33.933
Apparently, he was born in the Moscow Zoo.

01:03:33.934 --> 01:03:35.935
So he isn't from the wild?

01:03:35.936 --> 01:03:38.979
I think it's rare to see
wild wolves in zoos.

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:42.608
If they're bred, the babies
are sent out to be fostered.

01:03:42.609 --> 01:03:47.488
There are also wild birds and raccoon dogs
who are brought here when they get hurt.

01:03:47.489 --> 01:03:52.489
After we treat them--

01:03:52.661 --> 01:03:54.995
I'm going to start coming here from now on.

01:03:54.996 --> 01:03:59.124
Ame, you'll be okay coming with me, right?

01:03:59.125 --> 01:04:02.169
I'll learn about
the mountains and nature as I work,

01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:06.215
and teach you the things I learn.

01:04:06.216 --> 01:04:08.384
It was my first time seeing a real one.

01:04:08.385 --> 01:04:09.885
A wolf?

01:04:09.886 --> 01:04:11.887
Was Daddy like that, too?

01:04:11.888 --> 01:04:13.889
No, not at all.

01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:14.932
I'm glad.

01:04:14.933 --> 01:04:16.558
Why?

01:04:16.559 --> 01:04:21.559
Because he seemed kind of sad, somehow.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:27.440
I wanted to meet Daddy.

01:04:27.696 --> 01:04:31.991
Mommy wants to see him again, too.

01:04:31.992 --> 01:04:36.992
As Mother settled into her new job,
I was undergoing a huge shock.

01:04:37.539 --> 01:04:39.081
Bunko, yours is so nice!

01:04:39.082 --> 01:04:40.708
Keno, yours is pretty, too!

01:04:40.709 --> 01:04:42.710
I found a four-leaf clover!

01:04:42.711 --> 01:04:43.836
Me, too!

01:04:43.837 --> 01:04:46.672
Yuki, did you find anything?

01:04:46.673 --> 01:04:50.342
Yeah, look!

01:04:50.343 --> 01:04:55.343
I found out that no other girls
played with rat snakes for fun.

01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:58.767
Look, these used to be my mom's.

01:04:58.768 --> 01:05:00.269
They're so pretty.

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:02.980
My parents bought this for me
for my last birthday.

01:05:02.981 --> 01:05:04.648
Lucky!

01:05:04.649 --> 01:05:06.650
Yuki, show us your treasure box, too!

01:05:06.651 --> 01:05:07.526
Okay!

01:05:07.527 --> 01:05:08.986
Ooh, what's inside?

01:05:08.987 --> 01:05:12.114
Look!

01:05:12.115 --> 01:05:17.115
I was also the only girl who collected
small animal bones and dried reptiles.

01:05:20.248 --> 01:05:24.126
The moment I realized
that other girls didn't do those things,

01:05:24.127 --> 01:05:26.462
I was so embarrassed.

01:05:26.463 --> 01:05:28.172
Hurry UP!

01:05:28.173 --> 01:05:30.507
That was when I decided.

01:05:30.508 --> 01:05:35.508
From then on, I was going to act
more graceful and ladylike.

01:05:38.933 --> 01:05:41.810
Don't laugh! I'm seriously
worrying about this!

01:05:41.811 --> 01:05:44.938
Why don't you just do what you want, Yuki?

01:05:44.939 --> 01:05:47.524
I don't want people looking at me funny!

01:05:47.525 --> 01:05:49.359
I guess it can't be helped.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:49.860
Huh?

01:05:56.159 --> 01:06:01.159
When Mother made a new dress for me,
I remember being really happy.

01:06:02.665 --> 01:06:03.499
Good morning.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.251
Thanks to the dress,
I was able to fit in with my class

01:06:06.252 --> 01:06:09.129
--and get along with my friends.
--Good morning!

01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:10.297
Good morning!

01:06:10.298 --> 01:06:12.424
Oh, Yuki, your dress is so cute!

01:06:12.425 --> 01:06:13.717
It's wonderful!

01:06:13.718 --> 01:06:16.053
--Lucky! --Heaven only knows
how much that dress helped me.

01:06:16.054 --> 01:06:18.055
--Okay! --Heaven only knows how
much that dress helped me.

01:06:18.056 --> 01:06:19.223
The next year,

01:06:19.224 --> 01:06:21.975
it was hard to get Ame to school.

01:06:21.976 --> 01:06:26.976
Get it? It's "Piggy promise, promise kept."

01:06:27.899 --> 01:06:32.899
School's this way!

01:06:38.159 --> 01:06:43.159
"Happy first day of school!"
"1st Grade"

01:06:43.623 --> 01:06:48.623
"Let's get along!"
"2nd Grade"

01:06:50.046 --> 01:06:55.046
"Full of energy!"
"1st Grade"

01:06:58.638 --> 01:07:03.638
"Let's be friends!"
"2nd Grade"

01:07:17.991 --> 01:07:22.991
"Please and Thank You"
"3rd Grade"

01:07:23.746 --> 01:07:28.746
"Let's fly together!"
"4th Grade"

01:07:30.003 --> 01:07:35.003
"Let's figure it out!"
"3rd Grade"

01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:46.059
Good morning.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.604
Oh, Ame, is it a school holiday?

01:07:48.605 --> 01:07:49.229
No.

01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:50.189
So you're skipping?

01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:52.733
Yeah.

01:07:52.734 --> 01:07:54.860
You can come here anytime.

01:07:54.861 --> 01:07:57.738
Sorry for always bringing him here.

01:07:57.739 --> 01:07:59.364
--Yes, this is the observation pond.
--Ah, you're going bird-watching.

01:07:59.365 --> 01:08:03.410
--You can see frogs that still have their tails.
--One moment, please. You'll find it...

01:08:03.411 --> 01:08:05.495
--Hana, can you help me for a sec?
--...over there on your right.

01:08:05.496 --> 01:08:05.996
Coming!

01:08:20.303 --> 01:08:22.054
Attention, everyone!

01:08:22.055 --> 01:08:25.765
Let me introduce a transfer student.
This is Sohei Fujii.

01:08:25.767 --> 01:08:27.517
Why don't you greet everyone?

01:08:27.518 --> 01:08:29.728
I'm Sohei. Nice to meet you.

01:08:29.729 --> 01:08:34.316
Nice to meet you!

01:08:34.317 --> 01:08:36.944
Hey, do you have dogs at your house?

01:08:36.944 --> 01:08:38.737
Huh? Why?

01:08:38.738 --> 01:08:43.408
You smell kind of like animals.

01:08:43.408 --> 01:08:44.451
We don't have any dogs.

01:08:44.452 --> 01:08:49.206
Really? That's weird.
I totally thought you had dogs.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:50.499
What is it?

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.626
Huh? Oh, the smell--

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:54.377
Smell? What smell?

01:08:54.379 --> 01:08:59.379
Maybe it's just my imagination...

01:09:08.559 --> 01:09:10.435
Which one should I pick...?

01:09:10.435 --> 01:09:11.812
I'll go with this one!

01:09:11.813 --> 01:09:15.816
Aw man, seriously?

01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:17.149
Oh, Yuki!

01:09:17.151 --> 01:09:20.779
Yuki, you should come join us.
Sohei's funny.

01:09:20.779 --> 01:09:24.658
Oh, I have to return this book.

01:09:24.658 --> 01:09:26.660
What's up with her?

01:09:26.661 --> 01:09:29.787
She's not usually like that...

01:09:29.788 --> 01:09:31.707
Hey, Yuki, you know--

01:09:31.707 --> 01:09:33.582
Oh, Yuki--

01:09:33.584 --> 01:09:35.752
You know what?

01:09:35.752 --> 01:09:37.170
Hey. Yuki!

01:09:37.171 --> 01:09:38.380
Yuki--

01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:41.966
C'mon, Yuki--

01:09:41.968 --> 01:09:46.138
Tell me the truth!

01:09:46.139 --> 01:09:47.096
About what?

01:09:47.098 --> 01:09:49.599
Did I do something to you?

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.100
You didn't do anything.

01:09:51.102 --> 01:09:53.353
Do you dislike me
because I'm a transfer student?

01:09:53.354 --> 01:09:54.354
That's it, isn't it?

01:09:54.355 --> 01:09:55.605
I said, it's nothing.

01:09:55.606 --> 01:09:57.065
Then why are you avoiding me?

01:09:57.066 --> 01:09:58.734
I'm not avoiding you!

01:09:58.735 --> 01:10:00.736
Piggy promise, promise kept.

01:10:00.737 --> 01:10:02.738
Piggy promise, promise kept.

01:10:02.739 --> 01:10:05.324
--Piggy--
--Hey!

01:10:05.325 --> 01:10:06.450
Wait!

01:10:06.451 --> 01:10:08.076
Piggy promise, promise kept.

01:10:08.077 --> 01:10:09.828
Piggy promise, promise kept.

01:10:09.829 --> 01:10:11.371
Piggy promise, promise kept.

01:10:11.372 --> 01:10:16.372
Piggy promise, promise kept.

01:10:24.594 --> 01:10:27.179
Stop following me!

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.264
Don't come any closer!

01:10:29.265 --> 01:10:30.682
What are you doing?

01:10:30.683 --> 01:10:32.476
Don't touch me!

01:10:32.477 --> 01:10:37.477
Yuki! Yuki!

01:10:47.742 --> 01:10:52.742
"Tsururindo"

01:11:08.012 --> 01:11:12.682
Sorry to bother you during work.

01:11:12.683 --> 01:11:15.227
Do you know how much
his head was bleeding?

01:11:15.228 --> 01:11:16.812
It was my ear.

01:11:16.813 --> 01:11:18.313
Yuki.

01:11:18.314 --> 01:11:23.314
She wouldn't talk no matter
what we asked her...

01:11:24.612 --> 01:11:29.574
Were you really the one who hurt him?

01:11:29.575 --> 01:11:34.575
Did you apologize?

01:11:35.081 --> 01:11:37.457
Apologize.

01:11:37.458 --> 01:11:42.458
I said, apologize.

01:11:51.347 --> 01:11:54.599
I'm sorry.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.060
I'm very sorry for what my child has done.

01:11:57.061 --> 01:11:59.729
That's how it is, Mrs. Fujii.

01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:02.399
There is the school's insurance
for the medical bills, so--

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:07.400
Do you really think this can be
taken care of with just an apology?!

01:12:07.405 --> 01:12:11.032
What were you planning to do
if he lost his hearing?

01:12:11.033 --> 01:12:13.618
Parents are responsible
for their children's actions, aren't they?

01:12:13.619 --> 01:12:16.705
Would you go into debt
or sell your house to compensate us?

01:12:16.706 --> 01:12:18.915
Now, now, this isn't the place to--

01:12:18.916 --> 01:12:22.294
If you don't let me
hear what she's thinking, I'll--

01:12:22.295 --> 01:12:23.628
A wolf.

01:12:23.629 --> 01:12:25.422
What?

01:12:25.423 --> 01:12:29.551
It was a wolf that did it.

01:12:29.552 --> 01:12:31.178
A wolf did it.

01:12:31.179 --> 01:12:32.471
Sohei?

01:12:32.472 --> 01:12:34.473
What are you saying?

01:12:34.474 --> 01:12:36.183
Sohei!

01:12:36.184 --> 01:12:38.018
Sohei?

01:12:38.019 --> 01:12:39.728
Don't decide whose fault it is already!

01:12:39.729 --> 01:12:40.729
I know!

01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:42.272
She's been different lately--

01:12:42.273 --> 01:12:42.773
Sum it!

01:12:48.529 --> 01:12:53.529
That's what I thought.

01:12:58.539 --> 01:13:00.540
What happened to Sohei?

01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:01.917
He left early.

01:13:01.918 --> 01:13:03.210
Why?

01:13:03.211 --> 01:13:04.461
Because he got hurt.

01:13:04.462 --> 01:13:06.338
How did he get hurt?

01:13:06.339 --> 01:13:07.339
That's--

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.382
Who hurt him?

01:13:09.383 --> 01:13:11.426
Um...

01:13:11.427 --> 01:13:11.885
Yuki!

01:13:11.886 --> 01:13:13.011
--Yuki!
--I thought it was her.

01:13:13.012 --> 01:13:14.679
--Thought so.
--What's wrong?

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.014
I'm like a detective--

01:13:16.015 --> 01:13:21.015
Quiet! Everyone, quiet down!

01:13:22.355 --> 01:13:25.357
It didn't work.

01:13:25.358 --> 01:13:30.358
No matter how many times I tried the charm.

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:35.534
Will I be chased out of school?

01:13:35.535 --> 01:13:40.535
Will we have to leave our house?

01:13:41.541 --> 01:13:45.335
I'm sorry...

01:13:45.336 --> 01:13:50.336
I'm sorry!

01:13:51.467 --> 01:13:55.262
Mom, I'm sorry!

01:13:55.263 --> 01:14:00.263
All better, all better.

01:14:15.157 --> 01:14:20.157
"School Bus"

01:14:39.432 --> 01:14:39.932
Sohei?

01:14:49.525 --> 01:14:54.525
Homework. From Sohei.

01:15:11.005 --> 01:15:16.005
From Sohei.

01:15:20.765 --> 01:15:24.309
Ow...

01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:27.312
Sohei!

01:15:27.313 --> 01:15:31.358
She went to play at Shino's house today.

01:15:31.359 --> 01:15:33.735
I see...

01:15:33.736 --> 01:15:38.736
Oh, wait a minute.

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.416
You came a long way, didn't you?

01:15:48.417 --> 01:15:52.295
Thank you for coming by every day.

01:15:52.296 --> 01:15:57.296
I don't want Yuki to stop coming to school.

01:15:57.426 --> 01:16:02.426
You know, that day,
you said that a wolf did it, right?

01:16:02.473 --> 01:16:04.683
What did you mean by that?

01:16:04.684 --> 01:16:08.311
That was... I mean...

01:16:08.312 --> 01:16:13.312
You might not believe me, but that
day, I saw a wolf for a split second,

01:16:13.818 --> 01:16:18.818
and when I came to, I was bleeding.
So the wolf was the one who did it.

01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:22.117
I mean, it wasn't Yuki's fault.

01:16:22.118 --> 01:16:26.371
I know other kids
are saying stupid things, but...

01:16:26.372 --> 01:16:29.124
I see.

01:16:29.125 --> 01:16:32.210
Can I ask you one more thing?

01:16:32.211 --> 01:16:37.211
Do you hate wolves?

01:16:37.758 --> 01:16:40.969
Not really.

01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:45.970
Me neither.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:06.202
Hey, you wanna see this?

01:17:06.203 --> 01:17:06.703
What?

01:17:12.209 --> 01:17:15.086
It's cool, isn't it? Wanna touch it?

01:17:15.087 --> 01:17:15.587
Here.

01:17:21.802 --> 01:17:23.219
Does it hurt?

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:28.220
It itches.

01:17:28.768 --> 01:17:29.380
Let's go!

01:17:34.106 --> 01:17:36.024
I'm going now.

01:17:36.025 --> 01:17:37.650
Where are you going?

01:17:37.651 --> 01:17:38.818
I'm going to Sensei's place.

01:17:38.819 --> 01:17:40.195
Who's Sensei?

01:17:40.196 --> 01:17:42.989
Sensei... is Sensei.

01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:45.575
I see. Will you be okay by yourself?

01:17:45.576 --> 01:17:46.868
Yeah.

01:17:46.869 --> 01:17:47.911
Be careful.

01:17:47.912 --> 01:17:48.995
Okay.

01:17:48.996 --> 01:17:50.538
Don't stay out too late.

01:17:50.539 --> 01:17:51.039
Okay.

01:17:55.753 --> 01:17:56.961
Where's Yuki?

01:17:56.962 --> 01:17:58.671
She went back to school today.

01:17:58.672 --> 01:18:00.173
Oh, that's good.

01:18:00.174 --> 01:18:01.591
What about Ame?

01:18:01.592 --> 01:18:03.676
He comes and goes, I guess.

01:18:03.677 --> 01:18:05.678
That's fine.

01:18:05.679 --> 01:18:06.763
There's something to be said

01:18:06.764 --> 01:18:09.974
for a guy who stops
going to school in elementary school.

01:18:09.975 --> 01:18:11.976
Edison and I were both like that.

01:18:11.977 --> 01:18:14.145
There you go, saying such
irresponsible things again!

01:18:14.146 --> 01:18:16.397
Speaking of which,
does anyone live on the mountain?

01:18:16.398 --> 01:18:17.023
On the mountain?

01:18:17.024 --> 01:18:19.526
Ame said he was going to Sensei's place...

01:18:19.527 --> 01:18:21.861
I was sure he was talking
about Grandpa Nirasaki, but...

01:18:21.862 --> 01:18:23.863
I don't know about that...

01:18:23.864 --> 01:18:28.159
No one would go into the mountains
during the busy farming season.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:31.037
Sensei knows everything.

01:18:31.038 --> 01:18:33.039
He knows everything about the mountain.

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.417
I didn't think you'd make friends
with someone older than you.

01:18:36.418 --> 01:18:40.547
Bring him over to our house sometime.
I want to thank him, and--

01:18:40.548 --> 01:18:42.549
Sensei doesn't meet with humans.

01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:47.303
He doesn't come down to the village
like the wild boars and bears.

01:18:47.304 --> 01:18:52.304
But it's probably okay if it's you, Mom.

01:19:06.532 --> 01:19:11.532
Sensei is the master
of the entire mountain in these parts.

01:19:12.371 --> 01:19:17.371
Thank you for always taking care of Ame.

01:21:48.402 --> 01:21:53.402
"Hometown Nature"

01:21:59.079 --> 01:22:04.079
"Hometown Nature"

01:22:05.335 --> 01:22:07.503
You can take a bath now.

01:22:07.504 --> 01:22:09.922
Yuki, you should have
Sensei teach you, too.

01:22:09.923 --> 01:22:12.633
Your hunting will get a lot better.

01:22:12.634 --> 01:22:15.344
There's a trick to running
through the forest at full speed.

01:22:15.345 --> 01:22:18.389
And to reading the terrain, too.

01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:20.099
You'll learn a lot.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.351
How to find water and how
to read the weather,

01:22:22.352 --> 01:22:25.646
and marking your territory
and getting along with others--

01:22:25.647 --> 01:22:27.065
There's no way I'm going.

01:22:27.066 --> 01:22:27.857
Why not?

01:22:27.858 --> 01:22:30.318
What about you?
Why won't you come to school?

01:22:30.319 --> 01:22:32.528
Because the mountain's interesting.

01:22:32.529 --> 01:22:34.238
Because there's a lot I don't know.

01:22:34.239 --> 01:22:35.615
I don't need to know.

01:22:35.616 --> 01:22:36.407
Why not?

01:22:36.408 --> 01:22:40.161
Just come to school already.

01:22:40.162 --> 01:22:40.912
I don't want to.

01:22:40.913 --> 01:22:41.662
Why not?

01:22:41.663 --> 01:22:42.622
Because I'm a wolf.

01:22:42.623 --> 01:22:43.623
You're a human.

01:22:43.624 --> 01:22:48.624
I'm a wolf.

01:22:49.338 --> 01:22:51.923
I've already decided not to become a wolf.

01:22:51.924 --> 01:22:53.758
Why not?

01:22:53.759 --> 01:22:54.759
Hey, Why not?

01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:57.804
Because I'm human! Do you hear me?!
Because I'm human!

01:22:57.805 --> 01:22:59.055
But Why?

01:22:59.056 --> 01:23:00.807
Stop asking so many questions!

01:23:00.808 --> 01:23:03.351
You're a wolf, aren't you?
Why don't you act like one?

01:23:03.352 --> 01:23:05.686
Shut up! You don't know anything!

01:23:05.687 --> 01:23:07.188
About what?

01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:09.565
If you don't come to school tomorrow,
I'll never forgive you!

01:23:09.566 --> 01:23:10.441
I'm not going!

01:23:10.442 --> 01:23:11.692
I'll never forgive you!

01:23:11.693 --> 01:23:16.693
I'm not going!

01:23:19.326 --> 01:23:21.953
Wanna fight?

01:23:21.954 --> 01:23:25.748
What is it? What's that sound?

01:23:25.749 --> 01:23:30.749
Yuki! Ame!

01:23:33.632 --> 01:23:38.632
Stop it, both of you!

01:23:50.691 --> 01:23:55.691
Stop it, Yuki! Ame!

01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:12.378
Yuki...

01:24:12.379 --> 01:24:12.879
Ame...?

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:22.180
Ame...

01:24:50.667 --> 01:24:55.667
Yuki and Ame are both
starting to walk their own paths.

01:24:56.381 --> 01:25:01.381
Even though that's what I wanted...
Why am I so uneasy?

01:25:04.681 --> 01:25:09.681
Why is that?

01:25:15.901 --> 01:25:20.901
My last summer in elementary school, there
were a number of record-breaking storms.

01:25:21.782 --> 01:25:26.410
Ame started to go
into the mountains all the time.

01:25:26.411 --> 01:25:31.411
He seemed to be very worried
about the effects of the heavy rains

01:25:31.792 --> 01:25:36.792
on Sensei and the plants
and animals of the mountains.

01:26:01.071 --> 01:26:04.448
Ame!

01:26:04.449 --> 01:26:07.034
Where have you been all this time?

01:26:07.035 --> 01:26:10.162
You're cold. Hang on,
I'll get the bath ready.

01:26:10.163 --> 01:26:13.958
Sensei... hurt his leg, and he can't move.

01:26:13.959 --> 01:26:18.959
He'll probably die soon.

01:26:19.756 --> 01:26:24.756
Someone has to take over all the things
he has been doing on the mountain.

01:26:28.098 --> 01:26:30.141
Ame.

01:26:30.142 --> 01:26:32.852
You can't go into the mountains anymore.
Do you understand?

01:26:32.853 --> 01:26:35.563
You're only ten years old.
You're still a child!

01:26:35.564 --> 01:26:40.564
Even if a ten-year-old wolf is an adult,
you're still--

01:26:51.872 --> 01:26:53.831
Please.

01:26:53.832 --> 01:26:56.751
Please don't go into the mountains anymore.

01:26:56.752 --> 01:27:01.752
Please... For me.

01:27:03.425 --> 01:27:07.345
C'mon! Over here!

01:27:07.346 --> 01:27:12.346
Shoot it! Pass it!

01:27:13.977 --> 01:27:18.522
--By the way, did you know?
--Know what?

01:27:18.523 --> 01:27:19.398
And?

01:27:19.399 --> 01:27:21.150
They said Sohei's mom...

01:27:21.151 --> 01:27:22.401
...is getting married!

01:27:22.402 --> 01:27:24.195
--What?
--No way!

01:27:24.196 --> 01:27:25.321
Why?

01:27:25.322 --> 01:27:26.530
Probably because she's beautiful.

01:27:26.531 --> 01:27:28.949
Then Sohei will have a new dad?

01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:29.867
That's good.

01:27:29.868 --> 01:27:33.371
But Sohei doesn't know about this yet.

01:27:33.372 --> 01:27:34.538
What?

01:27:34.539 --> 01:27:36.957
“No Way!
--Really?

01:27:36.958 --> 01:27:41.003
You can't tell anyone about this!

01:27:41.004 --> 01:27:44.715
All right! Yes!

01:27:44.716 --> 01:27:49.716
How many points do we have now?

01:28:39.271 --> 01:28:40.521
Good morning.

01:28:40.522 --> 01:28:42.773
Today, it will be sunny during the day,

01:28:42.774 --> 01:28:46.318
but heavy rain will start
in the evening and continue overnight.

01:28:46.319 --> 01:28:48.988
--It's so humid! --Please use caution
if you go out during this time.

01:28:48.989 --> 01:28:51.490
First, the meteorological report.

01:28:51.491 --> 01:28:52.116
Yuki--

01:28:52.117 --> 01:28:55.786
--Hm? --Today will start mostly sunny with high
atmospheric pressure within the prefecture,

01:28:55.787 --> 01:28:59.039
--Stay with Mom. --but the weather
front will extend to the Sea of Japan,

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:02.710
--You'll miss the bus-- --causing stormy
weather from the evening into the night.

01:29:02.711 --> 01:29:05.880
--You stay at home with her.
--And now for the regional forecast.

01:29:05.881 --> 01:29:09.341
--Take care! --In the northwest region,
it will be sunny followed by rain,

01:29:09.342 --> 01:29:12.636
with lightning in some parts.

01:29:12.637 --> 01:29:16.056
The southwest region
will be sunny followed by rain.

01:29:16.057 --> 01:29:19.435
--Ame? --The northeast region will
be sunny with scattered showers.

01:29:19.436 --> 01:29:23.898
--Ame! --The southeast region will
be sunny with scattered showers.

01:29:23.899 --> 01:29:28.899
--Don't forget your umbrellas
when you go out today.

01:29:30.864 --> 01:29:35.576
So the problem is asking, how far
can the swallow fly in three hours?

01:29:35.577 --> 01:29:39.246
First of all, do you know
what seventy km/h means?

01:29:39.247 --> 01:29:41.040
If you take seventy km,

01:29:41.041 --> 01:29:44.043
km/h means the number
of kilometers traveled per hour.

01:29:44.044 --> 01:29:48.756
So in one hour,
the swallow can fly seventy kilometers.

01:29:48.757 --> 01:29:51.383
The weather front along
the Sea of Japan is moving south,

01:29:51.384 --> 01:29:54.887
and atmospheric conditions
have become extremely unstable.

01:29:54.888 --> 01:29:56.013
Because of this,

01:29:56.014 --> 01:30:00.559
there will be lightning and sudden gusts
accompanying the heavy rains.

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:04.438
Predicted rainfall is,
depending on the location,

01:30:04.439 --> 01:30:08.025
over seventy mm per hour in the flat areas,
and near the mountains,

01:30:08.026 --> 01:30:10.486
over one hundred mm per hour.

01:30:10.487 --> 01:30:15.157
The weather station has issued
a heavy rain flood warning.

01:30:15.158 --> 01:30:20.079
Use extreme caution due to possible landslides,
rises in river level, submersion of buildings,

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:23.666
as well as other damage.

01:30:23.667 --> 01:30:27.336
And now, for today's
eleven o'clock weather alerts.

01:30:27.337 --> 01:30:32.337
In the northwest region,
heavy rain, lightning, and flood warnings.

01:30:46.481 --> 01:30:50.317
Have a seat, everyone. Sit down!

01:30:50.318 --> 01:30:53.153
It looks like there will be
severe rainstorms soon,

01:30:53.154 --> 01:30:55.406
so afternoon classes have been canceled.

01:30:55.407 --> 01:30:55.907
Yay!

01:31:03.164 --> 01:31:08.164
Until they come, gather in the gym
according to where you live.

01:31:27.522 --> 01:31:32.522
A blackout?

01:31:54.257 --> 01:31:59.257
I have to go.

01:32:04.059 --> 01:32:07.978
I understand. I'll head over now.

01:32:07.979 --> 01:32:11.982
Ame, let's go pick up Yuki together.

01:32:11.983 --> 01:32:12.483
Ame?

01:32:17.614 --> 01:32:18.822
Ame?

01:32:18.823 --> 01:32:23.619
Where are you?

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:24.120
Ame!

01:32:28.333 --> 01:32:28.833
Ame!

01:32:33.296 --> 01:32:35.964
Ame!

01:32:35.965 --> 01:32:36.465
Ame!

01:32:42.305 --> 01:32:44.765
Where are you, Ame?!

01:32:44.766 --> 01:32:45.266
Ame!

01:33:10.417 --> 01:33:12.751
Takahiro?

01:33:12.752 --> 01:33:13.252
Mommy!

01:33:17.215 --> 01:33:19.216
Keiko!

01:33:19.217 --> 01:33:21.009
Daddy!

01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:26.010
♪ Yankee Doodle came to town-- ♪

01:33:30.228 --> 01:33:33.021
My parents sure are late.

01:33:33.022 --> 01:33:34.440
Don't worry.

01:33:34.441 --> 01:33:36.024
But--

01:33:36.025 --> 01:33:38.402
If we have to stay at the school overnight,

01:33:38.403 --> 01:33:40.028
we can play cards all night.

01:33:40.029 --> 01:33:41.113
Cards?

01:33:41.114 --> 01:33:42.448
I wanna play.

01:33:42.449 --> 01:33:44.032
Oh, that sounds like fun!

01:33:44.033 --> 01:33:45.534
It'll be like camp!

01:33:45.535 --> 01:33:46.952
I'll go get the cards from the classroom.

01:33:46.953 --> 01:33:48.287
Okay.

01:33:48.288 --> 01:33:50.289
Do you even know how to play cards?

01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:52.082
I only know how to play Old Maid.

01:33:52.083 --> 01:33:53.167
Stupid!

01:33:53.168 --> 01:33:56.628
Don't fight, you two.

01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:58.380
Shino!

01:33:58.381 --> 01:33:59.882
Oh, Dad!

01:33:59.883 --> 01:34:01.508
You're so late.

01:34:01.509 --> 01:34:06.509
Sorry, sorry. It's a raging storm out there.
Yuki, we can take you home, too.

01:34:07.098 --> 01:34:09.558
Oh yeah, let's go, Yuki.

01:34:09.559 --> 01:34:11.268
But--

01:34:11.269 --> 01:34:13.187
C'mon, hurry up.

01:34:13.188 --> 01:34:17.274
Thank you for offering,
but I think my mom will be here soon.

01:34:17.275 --> 01:34:18.901
You don't have to hold back.

01:34:18.902 --> 01:34:20.360
Yeah.

01:34:20.361 --> 01:34:23.071
I don't want to miss my mom when she comes.

01:34:23.072 --> 01:34:26.158
That's true. We'll leave first, then.

01:34:26.159 --> 01:34:27.284
Bye!

01:34:27.285 --> 01:34:27.785
Bye.

01:34:42.592 --> 01:34:45.052
Ame!

01:34:45.053 --> 01:34:48.430
Where are you? Ame!

01:34:48.431 --> 01:34:48.931
Ame!

01:34:59.275 --> 01:35:01.735
Ame...

01:35:01.736 --> 01:35:02.348
Where...?

01:35:17.961 --> 01:35:22.961
Sou's taking a long time.

01:35:22.966 --> 01:35:23.466
Yuki--

01:35:32.517 --> 01:35:35.686
What, did Yuki go home already?

01:35:35.687 --> 01:35:38.105
Attention everyone!

01:35:38.106 --> 01:35:43.106
We'll take everyone that's left
home in the school's car.

01:36:18.271 --> 01:36:20.480
Ame!

01:36:20.481 --> 01:36:23.191
Ame!

01:36:23.192 --> 01:36:23.692
Ame!

01:36:29.032 --> 01:36:30.574
Wait!

01:36:30.575 --> 01:36:35.575
Wait, Ame!

01:37:35.556 --> 01:37:36.056
Ame...

01:37:40.937 --> 01:37:45.937
Where are you...?

01:37:58.204 --> 01:37:59.705
Why are you here?

01:37:59.706 --> 01:38:02.165
Because...

01:38:02.166 --> 01:38:04.001
...you were being slow.

01:38:04.002 --> 01:38:07.713
Oh, no one's here.
Did everyone go home already?

01:38:07.714 --> 01:38:11.466
I guess we're the only ones
not getting picked up.

01:38:11.467 --> 01:38:16.263
I wonder if something happened to my mom.

01:38:16.264 --> 01:38:17.180
It's cold.

01:38:17.181 --> 01:38:21.518
Let's walk around.

01:38:21.519 --> 01:38:22.477
Yuki.

01:38:22.478 --> 01:38:26.815
Oh, wait for me!

01:38:26.816 --> 01:38:29.484
What'll we do if no one
comes to pick us up?

01:38:29.485 --> 01:38:31.153
We can just live at school.

01:38:31.154 --> 01:38:32.654
We can't do that.

01:38:32.655 --> 01:38:34.865
We can sleep in the
nurse's office at night.

01:38:34.866 --> 01:38:36.033
What about food?

01:38:36.034 --> 01:38:38.035
We can eat leftover cafeteria food.

01:38:38.036 --> 01:38:41.371
What if no one ever comes to pick us up?
Will you live at school forever?

01:38:41.372 --> 01:38:44.458
I just have to get a job.
Delivering newspapers or something.

01:38:44.459 --> 01:38:47.127
You're just a kid. No
one's going to hire you.

01:38:47.128 --> 01:38:50.338
I'll lie about my age.
I'll tell them that I'm in middle school.

01:38:50.339 --> 01:38:55.339
Do I look like a middle schooler?

01:38:56.137 --> 01:38:57.054
No.

01:38:57.055 --> 01:38:57.555
Really?

01:39:02.143 --> 01:39:07.143
I want to grow up faster.

01:39:08.316 --> 01:39:08.816
Me too.

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.900
Ame...

01:40:33.901 --> 01:40:38.321
He's probably shivering somewhere...

01:40:38.322 --> 01:40:43.322
He's probably lost... crying...

01:40:43.619 --> 01:40:48.619
I have to... protect... him...

01:40:51.586 --> 01:40:56.586
I have to... protect...

01:41:12.398 --> 01:41:17.398
Is anyone still here?

01:41:25.953 --> 01:41:30.953
He's gone.

01:41:31.125 --> 01:41:36.125
My heart's still pounding.
Hey, why did we hide?

01:41:37.256 --> 01:41:37.756
Hey!

01:41:48.142 --> 01:41:50.185
It's like the ocean.

01:41:50.186 --> 01:41:53.355
I feel like it's going to suck me in.

01:41:53.356 --> 01:41:57.442
Will we really end up living here secretly?

01:41:57.443 --> 01:41:59.736
If our parents don't come,
then we have no choice, do we?

01:41:59.737 --> 01:42:03.365
Why? Your morn will come for sure.

01:42:03.366 --> 01:42:04.658
No, she won't.

01:42:04.659 --> 01:42:09.659
Why not? She's...

01:42:10.289 --> 01:42:13.541
My mom got married.

01:42:13.542 --> 01:42:18.542
And she's having a baby. So once it's
born, I won't be needed anymore.

01:42:21.676 --> 01:42:25.053
But she was so worried about you...

01:42:25.054 --> 01:42:27.472
I'm fine with that, though.

01:42:27.473 --> 01:42:31.601
I'll run away from home
and become a boxer or a wrestler.

01:42:31.602 --> 01:42:33.812
I'll live like a lone wolf.

01:42:33.813 --> 01:42:37.399
What do you think? Will it work?

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.526
You'll be defeated in a second.

01:42:39.527 --> 01:42:41.278
You have no muscles.

01:42:41.279 --> 01:42:42.320
I'll train.

01:42:42.321 --> 01:42:47.321
I'll train and live on my own.

01:42:56.419 --> 01:43:00.964
Sou, I want to be like you,

01:43:00.965 --> 01:43:05.965
and be able to smile
even when I'm telling the truth.

01:43:19.817 --> 01:43:21.735
Sou...

01:43:21.736 --> 01:43:23.028
That day,

01:43:23.029 --> 01:43:28.029
the wolf that hurt you was me...

01:43:31.078 --> 01:43:36.078
It was me.

01:43:36.667 --> 01:43:41.667
I kept thinking that I
had to say something.

01:43:42.715 --> 01:43:47.715
It hurt to hold it in.

01:43:49.138 --> 01:43:52.766
I already knew. I knew the whole time.

01:43:52.767 --> 01:43:57.645
I didn't tell anyone your secret.

01:43:57.646 --> 01:44:01.483
I won't tell. So...

01:44:01.484 --> 01:44:06.484
...don't cry anymore.

01:44:07.823 --> 01:44:12.823
I'm not crying, these are drops of rain.

01:44:20.711 --> 01:44:25.711
Thank you.

01:44:50.157 --> 01:44:54.828
Ame... Where did you go?

01:44:54.829 --> 01:44:55.329
Ame?

01:44:59.583 --> 01:45:01.835
Ame.

01:45:01.836 --> 01:45:03.545
I was looking for you.

01:45:03.546 --> 01:45:08.546
Come on, hurry back
so we can go pick up Yuki...

01:45:13.848 --> 01:45:14.348
Hana.

01:45:26.819 --> 01:45:29.904
I missed you so much!

01:45:29.905 --> 01:45:32.740
It's been hard, hasn't it?

01:45:32.741 --> 01:45:33.741
I'm sorry.

01:45:33.742 --> 01:45:36.035
It's okay.

01:45:36.036 --> 01:45:39.706
I was watching you the whole time.

01:45:39.707 --> 01:45:41.458
Yeah, I know.

01:45:41.459 --> 01:45:43.918
You raised our children well.

01:45:43.919 --> 01:45:47.422
No, that's not true. I keep messing up.

01:45:47.423 --> 01:45:49.007
It's true.

01:45:49.008 --> 01:45:51.426
Yuki and Ame have both grown up fine.

01:45:51.427 --> 01:45:54.345
That's not true. Because...

01:45:54.346 --> 01:45:58.475
Oh... Ame...

01:45:58.476 --> 01:46:03.476
That's right. Ame's gone.

01:46:04.231 --> 01:46:05.857
Ame!

01:46:05.858 --> 01:46:07.650
Ame's fine.

01:46:07.651 --> 01:46:09.611
But...

01:46:09.612 --> 01:46:11.070
He's fine.

01:46:11.071 --> 01:46:15.533
He's already an adult.

01:46:15.534 --> 01:46:17.368
An adult?

01:46:17.369 --> 01:46:22.369
He's found his own world.

01:47:02.748 --> 01:47:03.248
Ame?

01:47:07.002 --> 01:47:07.546
Oh, Ame!

01:47:13.592 --> 01:47:18.471
Are you going to leave?

01:47:18.472 --> 01:47:20.598
But...

01:47:20.599 --> 01:47:25.599
I still haven't been able
to do anything for you.

01:47:26.021 --> 01:47:30.066
I still haven't...

01:47:30.067 --> 01:47:35.067
But you're still...

01:47:43.038 --> 01:47:43.538
Wait!

01:47:47.084 --> 01:47:50.211
Ame!

01:47:50.212 --> 01:47:50.712
Ame...!

01:47:56.135 --> 01:47:56.635
Ame...!

01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:17.864
Ame...

01:48:17.865 --> 01:48:18.365
Ame...

01:48:48.979 --> 01:48:51.814
Be well...

01:48:51.815 --> 01:48:56.815
Live a good life!

01:49:14.129 --> 01:49:14.673
Goodbye.

01:49:28.268 --> 01:49:33.268
Mother said that she
would never forget that morning.

01:49:33.982 --> 01:49:38.486
The freshly washed beech leaves...
The freshly washed spider webs...

01:49:38.487 --> 01:49:41.614
The freshly washed sky...

01:49:41.615 --> 01:49:46.615
Everything glittering under the sun...
Like the world had been reborn overnight.

01:49:51.041 --> 01:49:56.041
That was what Mother thought.

01:50:18.861 --> 01:50:23.861
"Municipal Junior High School
Entrance Ceremony"

01:50:27.369 --> 01:50:32.369
Looking back on the twelve years
she spent raising us,

01:50:32.416 --> 01:50:37.170
Mother smiled, saying that it was
over in a moment, like a fairy tale.

01:50:37.171 --> 01:50:42.171
"Junior High"

01:50:58.650 --> 01:51:03.650
Mother is living quietly
in that mountain house even now.

01:51:28.806 --> 01:51:33.806
"Ame"
"The Forest is Alive"

01:51:49.576 --> 01:51:54.576
<i>"I hope to meet you soon,"</i>

01:51:56.500 --> 01:52:01.500
<i>I always prayed as I rubbed my belly</i>

01:52:03.632 --> 01:52:08.632
<i>(Ooh ooh) What will you look like?</i>

01:52:16.728 --> 01:52:21.728
<i>(Ooh ooh) What will you sound like?</i>

01:52:31.952 --> 01:52:36.952
<i>I see my reflection in your big eyes</i>

01:52:38.208 --> 01:52:43.208
<i>As teardrops spill onto your cheeks</i>

01:52:44.965 --> 01:52:49.965
<i>(Num nums) Come here, the food's ready!</i>

01:52:57.769 --> 01:53:02.769
<i>(Pitter patter) Come on,
let's go for a walk!</i>

01:53:11.450 --> 01:53:16.450
<i>Your eyes swollen, you sit
with your arms around your knees</i>

01:53:17.998 --> 01:53:22.998
<i>Tell me why you're crying,
tell me everything</i>

01:53:24.671 --> 01:53:29.671
<i>Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere</i>

01:53:30.886 --> 01:53:35.886
<i>No matter what happens, we'll be together</i>

01:53:37.351 --> 01:53:42.351
<i>I love your smiling face</i>

01:53:43.649 --> 01:53:48.649
<i>It makes me feel better, even when I'm down</i>

01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:55.030
<i>(Lalala lalala) Come here, let's sing!</i>

01:54:02.167 --> 01:54:07.167
<i>(Aroo aroo) Come on,
let's raise our voices together!</i>

01:54:14.805 --> 01:54:19.805
<i>I want you to grow up brightly and freely</i>

01:54:28.735 --> 01:54:33.735
<i>Running in the snow, counting clouds</i>

01:54:34.491 --> 01:54:39.491
<i>Playing in the rain,
being blown by the wind</i>

01:54:40.372 --> 01:54:45.372
<i>Buried under flowers, playing grass kazoos</i>

01:54:46.044 --> 01:54:51.044
<i>On four feet, on two feet</i>

01:54:52.009 --> 01:54:54.969
<i>A new morning</i>

01:54:54.970 --> 01:54:57.680
<i>A new wind</i>

01:54:57.681 --> 01:55:02.681
<i>Prepared just for you</i>

01:55:03.437 --> 01:55:06.188
<i>A new morning</i>

01:55:06.189 --> 01:55:09.025
<i>A new light</i>

01:55:09.026 --> 01:55:14.026
<i>The world is yours for the taking</i>

01:55:14.656 --> 01:55:17.491
<i>A new morning</i>

01:55:17.492 --> 01:55:20.369
<i>A new rainbow</i>

01:55:20.370 --> 01:55:25.370
<i>The world is full of mystery</i>

01:55:26.084 --> 01:55:31.084
<i>Choosing one of two paths,
eyes fixed on</i> a <i>point far</i> away

01:55:45.103 --> 01:55:50.103
<i>Is there nothing else I can do for you?</i>

01:56:00.368 --> 01:56:05.368
<i>Whenever you decide to leave,
I will see you off with a smile</i>

01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:23.470
<i>(Ooh ooh) But I'll still be a little sad</i>

01:56:30.190 --> 01:56:35.190
<i>(Aroo aroo) Please, live a good life</i>
