20:03.950 --> 20:05.921
He was pretty sick
towards the end, but...

20:05.954 --> 20:09.729

album and plan a scavenger hunt.

-(chuckles) Yeah.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.528
I think he expected more people.

20:43.696 --> 20:45.700
I'm actually surprised, too.

20:45.734 --> 20:48.940
I mean, all you had to do
was listen to the album.

20:48.973 --> 20:51.311
Yeah.

20:51.344 --> 20:53.482
He put so much effort into it,

20:53.516 --> 20:57.558
but I guess you don't always get
back what you give.

20:59.327 --> 21:01.431
He just worked so hard.

21:01.465 --> 21:03.937
And I just wish
he had had more fun.
