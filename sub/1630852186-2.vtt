00:06.000 --> 00:08.750
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:16.041 --> 00:22.875
MADRID
D-DAY

00:58.333 --> 00:59.958
<i>Remember the Chernobyl Plan?</i>

01:00.333 --> 01:02.500
<i>It was a desperate plan</i>
<i>from the previous job.</i>

01:03.041 --> 01:05.666
<i>It involved collapsing Madrid</i>
<i>with a shower of bank notes</i>

01:05.750 --> 01:08.125
<i>to escape among the turmoil</i>
<i>in case everything went wrong.</i>

01:08.416 --> 01:10.166
<i>The plan was intended to create chaos.</i>

01:12.250 --> 01:15.125
<i>And that was exactly</i>
<i>what we needed now.</i>

01:15.916 --> 01:16.750
<i>Chaos.</i>

01:19.250 --> 01:20.416
Do you want to answer it?

01:26.500 --> 01:27.333
Hello?

01:33.166 --> 01:34.000
Wait, zeppelins?

01:55.541 --> 01:57.166
I'll be there in eight minutes.

01:59.916 --> 02:03.291
The zeppelins are programmed to fly
to certain GPS coordinates,

02:03.375 --> 02:07.250
and only then
will they open their hatches.

02:07.333 --> 02:11.250
<i>Afterwards, they will fly in circles</i>
<i>within a radius of 250 meters</i>

02:11.333 --> 02:14.250
<i>and they will release wads of money</i>
<i>every 40 seconds</i>

02:14.333 --> 02:15.291
for 50 minutes.

02:16.708 --> 02:17.541
This...

02:18.291 --> 02:21.541
at a height of 300 meters,
like manna falling from the sky.

02:23.125 --> 02:26.250
<i>In total, we'll release 140 million euros.</i>

02:29.333 --> 02:31.958
It's going to be expensive
to venture into the lion's den, huh?

02:34.125 --> 02:34.958
You...

02:35.958 --> 02:37.958
We have all been called Robin Hoods.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.625
It makes sense that part of the loot
ends with the people.

03:23.458 --> 03:24.458
This message...

03:26.250 --> 03:30.000
<i>goes to all of you who believe that</i>
<i>this mask is a symbol of the resistance.</i>

03:31.583 --> 03:32.916
<i>We need you.</i>

03:33.958 --> 03:35.875
<i>The State has declared war against us.</i>

03:36.291 --> 03:37.375
<i>A dirty war.</i>

03:38.291 --> 03:39.958
We have decided to stand up to them.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.416
<i>The police have arrested one of us</i>
<i>in a foreign country.</i>

03:59.125 --> 04:00.000
<i>Aníbal.</i>

04:01.458 --> 04:02.291
<i>You can't sleep?</i>

04:03.041 --> 04:03.875
Aníbal Cortés.

04:07.833 --> 04:08.666
Come with me.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.500
Let's go get some more coffee.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.708
<i>It's been almost two months</i>
<i>since that happened.</i>

04:14.208 --> 04:16.416
<i>No legal proceedings have been initiated.</i>

04:18.333 --> 04:20.041
<i>No extradition has been requested.</i>

04:21.833 --> 04:23.750
<i>No defense lawyer has been provided.</i>

04:23.958 --> 04:25.166
<i>He's kept in captivity...</i>

04:26.333 --> 04:28.916
<i>somewhere unknown.</i>
<i>And most likely...</i>

04:29.666 --> 04:30.916
he's being tortured.

04:35.625 --> 04:37.000
We demand...

04:38.625 --> 04:42.000
the immediate end
to this illegal detention

04:42.333 --> 04:45.500
<i>and that he be brought to justice in a way</i>
<i>that respects all legal safeguards.</i>

04:47.083 --> 04:48.791
<i>The State has begun this war.</i>

04:49.625 --> 04:50.916
And we shall not hide.

04:53.291 --> 04:54.541
We shall fight,

04:56.583 --> 04:57.583
<i>blow...</i>

04:58.916 --> 04:59.750
for blow.

05:01.333 --> 05:02.166
<i>And this time...</i>

05:03.750 --> 05:05.375
CALLAO THEATER

05:05.458 --> 05:06.958
<i>...we're going big.</i>

05:24.000 --> 05:24.833
Furthermore,

05:27.541 --> 05:29.833
this is a game of chess.

05:31.333 --> 05:35.250
We're moving pieces
that will force the intelligence agency

05:35.666 --> 05:37.500
to move theirs.

05:37.583 --> 05:40.000
And Prieto will only be able
to do one thing...

05:43.041 --> 05:44.666
I want the army in the streets!

05:44.750 --> 05:47.625
They expect us to run
after those balloons,

05:47.708 --> 05:51.583
but it's the biggest distraction tactic
we've ever seen.

05:51.666 --> 05:53.125
Raise alert to Level 5.

05:53.208 --> 05:56.083
If they have the fucking nerve
to announce they're stealing again,

05:56.166 --> 05:59.000
they'll find everything
under protection. Shit!

05:59.083 --> 06:00.416
Whoever strikes first...

06:02.000 --> 06:04.625
has time on their side, but whoever
has to defend against that attack

06:04.708 --> 06:06.541
won't have that much time
to think about it,

06:06.625 --> 06:10.958
so Prieto will have to improvise
his strongest defense on the fly.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.666
The PM just gave us the green light.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.666
I want Madrid full of soldiers.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.625
I also want LMVs, armored cars--

06:18.083 --> 06:21.125
Armored cars, fuck! Armored cars!
There's nothing wrong with my mouth.

06:21.583 --> 06:23.750
There lies our ruse.

07:32.333 --> 07:33.208
Coming!

07:39.791 --> 07:40.958
Martín.

07:46.708 --> 07:47.541
May I?

07:55.208 --> 08:00.041
PALERMO, ITALY
2 MONTHS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

08:08.250 --> 08:09.083
Want a drink?

08:34.041 --> 08:35.166
The job was amazing.

08:38.875 --> 08:40.458
I'm glad you're alive.

08:41.541 --> 08:42.375
Thanks.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.458
However, if you stay outside,
hidden like a rat,

08:44.541 --> 08:46.958
your chances of survival increase.

08:50.416 --> 08:53.750
-I was the most exposed during the job.
-No. Don't bullshit me.

08:56.250 --> 08:59.333
Whoever faces the bullets
is the most exposed.

08:59.416 --> 09:01.791
-How many times were you shot at?
-I'm not here to argue.

09:02.291 --> 09:06.166
Quite frankly,
I couldn't care less why you're here.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.458
Three years later...

09:10.041 --> 09:10.916
and here you are.

09:11.916 --> 09:14.916
So, I'll tell you
why you didn't go into the Mint.

09:21.875 --> 09:23.125
Because you're a coward.

09:25.875 --> 09:26.916
And because...

09:28.666 --> 09:30.500
you had him do the dirty work.

09:31.583 --> 09:32.416
Your brother.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.541
A job always involves unknowns.
You know that.

09:36.625 --> 09:37.833
Unknowns?

09:41.708 --> 09:42.916
Let me be really clear.

09:46.958 --> 09:48.083
You didn't go in...

09:49.416 --> 09:52.125
and a third of your group died,
you son of a bitch.

09:54.541 --> 09:58.250
A third of your group died
and you did nothing, for fuck's sake.

09:59.791 --> 10:01.375
I'm as sorry as you are...

10:02.166 --> 10:06.458
What the fuck are you sorry for?
You son of a bitch!

10:10.333 --> 10:12.333
Andrés wouldn't have died
if I had been there.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.750
I'd have gone in and gotten him out!

10:17.583 --> 10:19.416
No matter the fucking cost!

10:19.708 --> 10:23.250
Even if I had to blow up
the whole building!

10:23.333 --> 10:25.708
I wouldn't have let him die! But you did!

10:26.625 --> 10:28.708
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to,

10:28.791 --> 10:30.541
one of those idiots from your group?

10:30.625 --> 10:31.958
I know you well, Sergio.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.500
I know what you're like.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.541
He was my friend.

10:38.541 --> 10:40.125
Someone indispensable to me.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.125
He was my other half.

10:43.416 --> 10:44.625
Look into my eyes...

10:45.958 --> 10:47.958
and tell me you never considered that.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.125
That, if need be,
he would let himself be killed.

10:53.125 --> 10:55.708
Tell me that when you thought
the plan out, you son of a bitch,

10:56.541 --> 10:58.791
you never considered your brother's death.

11:08.791 --> 11:10.875
I didn't consider my brother's death.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.291
Not once.

11:26.125 --> 11:28.000
He was my life.

11:38.791 --> 11:41.291
I'm sorry. It's not really your fault.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.583
It wasn't your fault.

11:44.125 --> 11:44.958
It wasn't.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.208
How are you?

11:54.166 --> 11:55.125
All right.

11:57.916 --> 11:59.625
Hanging around with Johnnie Walker...

12:00.875 --> 12:02.958
sucking down pills, eating canned food.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.041
But I'm all right.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.541
I found the formula.

12:09.708 --> 12:10.541
Music.

12:14.083 --> 12:18.083
Have you locked yourself up
and been listening to music all this time?

12:29.916 --> 12:32.291
I can listen to music from my youth
and travel there.

12:33.916 --> 12:35.916
To the shabbiest music bars
of Buenos Aires.

12:39.166 --> 12:41.166
I dance and swing like before...

12:43.041 --> 12:44.208
when pain didn't exist.

12:47.291 --> 12:49.083
Dance with me.

12:49.166 --> 12:50.750
Come on, don't be an ass.

12:50.833 --> 12:52.125
Dance!

12:54.541 --> 12:55.625
There you go.

12:56.541 --> 12:57.500
Try this.

13:04.625 --> 13:05.916
Why are you here?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.083
To ask your permission.

13:18.625 --> 13:20.208
I'm going to steal the gold.

13:22.458 --> 13:24.958
I'd tell you
it's in my brother's memory, but...

13:25.750 --> 13:26.875
the truth is...

13:29.333 --> 13:30.916
I need to do it.

13:33.833 --> 13:35.375
And I won't do it without you.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.333
Mónica.

14:21.416 --> 14:23.166
-Denver, not now.
-No, it's got to be now.

14:23.250 --> 14:25.083
Because I'm not going in
if we don't fix it.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.833
Grab your M16 and do what you have to.

14:28.916 --> 14:30.333
I didn't mean what I said.

14:30.666 --> 14:33.583
It was 3:00 in the morning.
I'm a loudmouth, forgive me.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.666
But to stop talking to me
for three days...

14:49.541 --> 14:50.833
Things are starting to move.

15:01.666 --> 15:02.625
Can you hear me?

15:02.708 --> 15:03.541
Copy.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.416
-Can you?
-Hold on.

15:06.041 --> 15:07.333
Now. Try again.

15:08.833 --> 15:10.416
What are you wearing, Inspector?

15:15.250 --> 15:16.083
Let's do it.

15:31.041 --> 15:34.916
<i>With money to invest in R&D,</i>
<i>you can achieve wonderful things.</i>

15:36.458 --> 15:38.291
<i>Three weeks prior to the job,</i>

15:38.375 --> 15:40.708
<i>we were inside both the CNI's</i>
<i>and the police's mobile phones</i>

15:40.791 --> 15:42.958
<i>apps like WhatsApp.</i>

15:44.708 --> 15:46.458
<i>We could activate their mics,</i>

15:46.541 --> 15:48.541
<i>cameras and GPS.</i>

15:48.625 --> 15:50.416
ISLAMABAD
PAKISTAN

15:50.541 --> 15:55.000
<i>It took less than an hour to take over</i>
<i>the defense staff's telecommunications.</i>

15:55.958 --> 15:57.583
<i>Rio's job...</i>

15:58.291 --> 16:00.625
<i>was now done by 65 Pakistanis.</i>

16:05.666 --> 16:08.500
<i>They didn't look like they went to</i>
<i>parties in Silicon Valley,</i>

16:08.583 --> 16:09.833
<i>but they were geniuses.</i>

16:09.916 --> 16:12.708
<i>Thanks to them,</i>
<i>we had access to everything.</i>

16:15.458 --> 16:16.333
Seventy-six.

16:23.833 --> 16:25.000
Three.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.583
Three hundred twelve.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.750
<i>Top priority</i>
<i>for the following forward lines.</i>

16:33.833 --> 16:37.333

<i>Yours is the First Squad, Sixth Company</i>

16:58.541 --> 16:59.875
Ladies and gentlemen,

ours is the First Squad, Sixth Company
of BRIPAC.

17:03.708 --> 17:05.541
One-six, BRIPAC.

17:08.625 --> 17:10.083
You have 17 minutes.

17:10.166 --> 17:13.000
We have 16 minutes and 45 seconds!

17:13.583 --> 17:16.916
Warm heart, cool head. Come on!

17:21.125 --> 17:22.166
BRIPAC!

17:30.625 --> 17:31.958
Sixth company!

V-I?

17:39.333 --> 17:41.208
BPAC VI

17:47.500 --> 17:51.291
Do I need to say again
that there's no time left? Move!

17:55.250 --> 17:56.833
All ready in 7 minutes!

17:57.208 --> 17:58.416
Hurry the fuck up!

18:43.333 --> 18:46.333
3 DAYS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

18:54.833 --> 18:57.291
Stop shaking your leg,
you're going to wake Cincinnati.

18:57.666 --> 18:59.166
Cincinnati is very quiet.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.458
But I'm not.

19:03.166 --> 19:06.375
So, I'll tell you straight out:
I don't want you to go into the bank.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.333
We have a fucking baby.

19:08.416 --> 19:10.375
-Calm down before...
-I'm not calming down.

19:10.458 --> 19:13.458
I'm not calming down
because I haven't slept for three weeks.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.416
We are no Bonnie and Clyde, Mónica.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.250
You're a management secretary, not Rambo.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.458
Shit!

19:21.000 --> 19:22.208
-Denver...
-What?

19:23.208 --> 19:25.666
I'm ready to go in and I will.

19:25.750 --> 19:26.583
Ready to do what?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.625
To be here, camping with the Professor?

19:28.708 --> 19:30.208
At the summer camp of crime!

19:30.291 --> 19:32.833
-Listen to me!
-No, you listen to me, Mónica!

19:33.208 --> 19:36.041
I've been preparing since I was a child.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.291
I'd go into the street with a ball
and they'd just take it from me.

19:39.375 --> 19:42.541
And what did I do? Fight.
And the next day, it would happen again.

19:42.625 --> 19:44.541
And the next, and the next...

19:44.625 --> 19:46.708
By the time I was 9,
no one dared to step up to me.

19:46.791 --> 19:49.541
You can't learn that in a day.
And you can't leave a kid...

19:53.541 --> 19:55.208
here with some monks.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.875
I'm not leaving my kid.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.541
It's only going to be for three days,
not forever.

19:59.625 --> 20:00.916
What about breastfeeding him?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.791
<i>Breastfeeding him?</i>
<i>The kid already eats steak!</i>

20:02.875 --> 20:04.958
<i>-You're taking away his breast milk.</i>
<i>-No!</i>

20:05.041 --> 20:06.458
Helsi, are you awake?

20:07.708 --> 20:09.291
Yes, awake.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.333
<i>You're his mother, for fuck's sake!</i>

20:11.416 --> 20:13.250
I can't sleep
with Jesus Christ watching...

20:13.333 --> 20:14.458
Christ is watching those two.

20:15.208 --> 20:18.166
Listen to Denver... I'm done with him.

20:18.250 --> 20:19.208
Shut up!

20:19.916 --> 20:21.166
And listen to me.

20:21.250 --> 20:24.000
I am a mother. But I'm also your wife.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.666
-And I'm a robber, too.
-No, you're not.

20:26.750 --> 20:29.791
Having a kid doesn't mean
I have to renounce the other two.

20:29.875 --> 20:32.583
Same as you. You're a dad, but
you don't even consider sitting it out.

20:32.916 --> 20:35.458
We may not be Bonnie and Clyde,
but I learn fast

20:36.208 --> 20:37.333
and I don't flinch.

20:37.416 --> 20:40.000
I prepared and passed
my exam for the Royal Mint in six weeks.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.708
What's that got to do with it?
There are no exams for robbery!

20:43.125 --> 20:44.583
The office girl is gone.

20:46.041 --> 20:48.458
Mónica Gaztambide is gone, Denver.

20:48.833 --> 20:51.333
She stayed back at the Royal Mint

20:51.416 --> 20:54.916
shooting at the police
to save you, Tokyo and Rio.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.750
So, don't tell me I'm sitting it out
to warm up baby bottles,

20:57.833 --> 21:00.416
because I am more of a robber than any
other motherfucker.

21:00.833 --> 21:02.500
Fucking sexist.

21:08.041 --> 21:08.875
Nairobi.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.125
-Don't leave me alone.
-Hey!

21:11.208 --> 21:12.708
Are you all right?

21:12.791 --> 21:14.041
No, I'm not all right.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.375
Can't blame you. I heard it all.

21:16.458 --> 21:18.666
That ass talking
about breastfeeding and all.

21:19.083 --> 21:22.000
-You're part of this gang.
-Mónica, you didn't get what I meant.

21:22.083 --> 21:24.916
She got every single thing you said.
You are a real caveman!

21:25.000 --> 21:26.458
-Go to bed!
-I'm not talking to you!

21:26.541 --> 21:28.791
-Go to your cave!
-Are you all right, girls? What happened?

21:28.875 --> 21:30.833
The patriarchy is fucking unbearable.

21:31.583 --> 21:32.416
The patriarchy?

21:32.500 --> 21:35.375
Patriarchy, that old model
with its macho chauvinism....

21:35.458 --> 21:36.583
Speaking of that.

21:36.666 --> 21:38.791
Do you know what the real patriarchy is?

21:38.875 --> 21:39.708
What?

21:39.791 --> 21:40.791
It's hanging here!

21:40.875 --> 21:42.750
What the fuck is wrong with you!
It's 3 a.m.

21:42.833 --> 21:44.083
Relax!

21:44.166 --> 21:45.000
Go and do the dishes!

21:45.083 --> 21:47.458
You're not sexist, you're just an asshole!

21:47.541 --> 21:50.375
Go to your room!
Go count your pubic hairs!

21:50.458 --> 21:51.833
Me and my dick and my dick...

21:56.833 --> 21:58.250
Do you know what time it is?

21:59.833 --> 22:00.833
It's 3 a.m.

22:00.916 --> 22:03.750
Tomorrow morning we need
to practice with the thermic lances,

22:03.833 --> 22:07.541
at 3580 degrees Celsius. I think...

22:08.583 --> 22:10.500
you should rest.

22:14.708 --> 22:15.708
Go to bed.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.375
Mónica, please, come with me.

22:21.750 --> 22:25.416
Sorry, Professor. We had a fight...

22:27.875 --> 22:29.708
I was going to sleep with Tokyo.

22:48.541 --> 22:52.083
42 MINUTES PAST H-HOUR

23:02.250 --> 23:03.083
Are you all right?

23:03.875 --> 23:04.791
Nervous.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.333
Well, calm down because this is like...

23:08.125 --> 23:09.791
playing chess.

23:10.375 --> 23:12.875
More like
the World Chess Championship, so...

23:13.875 --> 23:15.416
It's going to be a long match.

23:16.458 --> 23:18.125
The opening...

23:18.750 --> 23:19.750
One battle and...

23:21.333 --> 23:23.083
two opposing strategies.

23:26.083 --> 23:27.583
And then checkmate.

23:40.500 --> 23:41.333
Look.

23:42.041 --> 23:42.875
Here, on this side.

23:43.458 --> 23:44.666
See if you can feel it.

23:46.958 --> 23:47.791
Another one.

23:48.541 --> 23:49.750
Yeah.

23:50.916 --> 23:52.125
Like a tiny kick.

23:55.708 --> 23:58.708
Every time I have some coffee,
it goes crazy in there.

23:59.833 --> 24:02.250
Now, tell me about the carrier.

24:05.375 --> 24:07.541
I don't know anything about any handler.

24:07.625 --> 24:08.458
You don't?

24:10.125 --> 24:10.958
Yes, you do.

24:20.833 --> 24:21.666
Put the mask on.

24:27.833 --> 24:28.666
I don't want to.

24:30.333 --> 24:33.125
Either you do it or I get Osman to do it.

24:41.791 --> 24:42.625
Come on...

24:44.583 --> 24:46.958
Another little horsey ride.

24:50.416 --> 24:52.041
Let's see if we start remembering.

24:53.541 --> 24:55.208
My ankles are so swollen.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.333
There they are.

25:04.416 --> 25:05.416
Motherfuckers!

25:17.208 --> 25:20.166
<i>I was overwhelmed</i>
<i>by all those people insulting us.</i>

25:26.875 --> 25:29.958
<i>I'd have liked to lean</i>
<i>out the window and shout:</i>

25:30.708 --> 25:33.541
<i>"I'm Tokyo, one of you.</i>

25:34.708 --> 25:36.041
<i>We are Dalí..."</i>

25:38.875 --> 25:40.708
This mask has become a symbol.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.208
Across the whole world.

25:44.625 --> 25:46.000
Whether for those resisting,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
indignant or skeptical...
it doesn't matter.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.125
What really matters is
that it has inspired many people.

25:53.375 --> 25:54.208
Look at that.

25:55.375 --> 25:58.208
This is a demonstration against
corruption in Rio de Janeiro.

26:01.625 --> 26:03.416
Buenos Aires, Argentina,

26:03.750 --> 26:06.000
several women's rights marches.

26:09.708 --> 26:10.541
Colombia.

26:13.666 --> 26:14.500
Rome.

26:15.875 --> 26:16.708
Paris.

26:20.166 --> 26:22.166
The G20 Summit in Hamburg.

26:23.166 --> 26:24.750
LIBERTY, EQUALITY,
RESISTANCE

26:24.833 --> 26:27.583
They have filled entire stadiums.

26:27.666 --> 26:28.875
This is France.

26:32.041 --> 26:33.208
Saudi Arabia.

26:33.875 --> 26:35.750
What I'm trying to explain to you is that

26:35.833 --> 26:38.291
we have inspired many people
to fight with us.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.666
All those people are now one of us.

26:48.916 --> 26:50.416
Don't you ever forget that.

26:54.333 --> 26:55.333
<i>And there they were.</i>

26:56.041 --> 26:58.083
<i>The Professor had put on the mask,</i>

26:58.333 --> 27:00.416
<i>called all the Dalís out</i>

27:00.500 --> 27:01.916
<i>and the Dalís had responded.</i>

27:03.750 --> 27:07.208
<i>They planned it all out</i>
<i>on social media and WhatsApp groups.</i>

27:07.291 --> 27:08.541
<i>And they shouted</i>

27:08.625 --> 27:11.541
<i>what we needed to hear the most.</i>

27:12.250 --> 27:14.250
<i>"You will never walk alone."</i>

27:15.583 --> 27:17.291
ENOUGH

27:20.708 --> 27:22.791
<i>But that was mere poetry.</i>

27:22.875 --> 27:25.875
<i>The real action</i>
<i>was about to begin then and there.</i>

27:26.416 --> 27:28.333
TRAITORS

27:30.625 --> 27:33.166
BANK OF SPAIN
47 MINUTES PAST H-HOUR

27:37.083 --> 27:38.500
Come on! Move, move!

27:45.416 --> 27:48.500
-Step back! Everyone!
-Let's all stay calm.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.958
Come on, come on!

27:50.041 --> 27:52.166
Don't move! Nobody moves!

27:59.625 --> 28:01.458
The real convoy is on its way.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.583
It's five miles away.

28:16.750 --> 28:18.583
Five miles only takes six minutes.

28:18.666 --> 28:20.750
They only have six minutes to make it.

28:25.333 --> 28:26.458
Hail Mary.

28:27.208 --> 28:28.208
Fuck off.

28:35.666 --> 28:39.375
You must answer, "Full of grace."
We're in a holy place.

28:39.458 --> 28:41.083
You can be such an ass...

28:43.875 --> 28:45.083
Good afternoon. May I?

28:45.166 --> 28:46.833
Of course, Sergio, of course.

28:47.250 --> 28:48.083
Thank you.

28:50.458 --> 28:52.625
I've been studying the two plans,
in depth.

28:53.708 --> 28:56.083
I compared both. And I must say that...

28:56.166 --> 28:59.166
The Royal Mint is difficult,
really difficult, but possible.

28:59.250 --> 29:00.083
Even sensible.

29:00.916 --> 29:02.708
But to break into the Bank of Spain...

29:04.208 --> 29:06.083
is crazy...

29:06.666 --> 29:09.291
and, most importantly, impossible.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.708
-It may seem impossible...
-It is.

29:12.791 --> 29:14.625
And this seeming impossibility

29:15.291 --> 29:16.958
makes it very pretty.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.375
It seems impossible, but...

29:22.541 --> 29:24.083
Palermo, fill us in.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.708
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Bank of Spain.

29:28.166 --> 29:31.375
We go 10 meters under the floor, 20...

29:31.708 --> 29:32.541
30...

29:33.250 --> 29:34.083
40...

29:34.541 --> 29:35.750
And here she is.

29:37.583 --> 29:39.125
The vault.

29:39.208 --> 29:42.000
Forty-eight meters underground.

29:42.083 --> 29:45.750
The vault is completely airtight.

29:45.833 --> 29:46.666
Why?

29:47.916 --> 29:50.083
Because it can be flooded,
ladies and gentlemen.

29:50.166 --> 29:51.875
Damn ingenious Spaniards.

29:51.958 --> 29:54.375
You must be a perverse son of a bitch
to think that out!

29:54.458 --> 29:56.750
-Show some respect.
-It's a compliment.

29:56.833 --> 29:59.541
It's great. It's a masterpiece.

29:59.625 --> 30:00.625
Unique in the world.

30:00.708 --> 30:04.208
They channeled two streams
into the chamber with the gold.

30:04.291 --> 30:06.916
Twenty-eight miles
of reinforced pipes underground.

30:07.583 --> 30:09.583
-Why?
-So that in case someone

30:09.666 --> 30:11.375
touches this door...

30:15.208 --> 30:18.708
the chamber gets flooded
in less than 20 minutes.

30:19.625 --> 30:21.458
You touch the gold,

30:21.958 --> 30:25.583
and you explode like a toad,
you drown, man... A marvel!

30:27.666 --> 30:31.666
Everything is so discouraging that
nobody expects anyone to try and break in.

30:33.958 --> 30:35.625
That's why it'll be all right.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.208
Actually, it's very simple.

30:38.166 --> 30:39.833
If we use talent

30:40.375 --> 30:41.208
and science.

30:41.291 --> 30:43.916
The best minds in engineering...

30:45.041 --> 30:46.125
in physics,

30:46.666 --> 30:49.666
in fluid mechanics...
Can you imagine them preparing for a job?

30:49.750 --> 30:51.458
Excellency applied to robbery.

30:51.541 --> 30:53.791
But how on earth are you going in?

30:54.500 --> 30:58.125
There is a unit of the Civil Guard,
20 private security guards.

30:58.208 --> 31:01.208
The governor's bodyguards.
And the place has strategic importance.

31:01.666 --> 31:03.333
The army would be there within minutes.

31:03.916 --> 31:06.625
It's hard to get in
if you're dressed as a thief, yes.

31:07.041 --> 31:08.375
But, Sergio,

31:08.458 --> 31:09.916
imagine there's chaos,

31:10.208 --> 31:13.416
and you're the one everyone
is expecting to save the day.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.333
And it's so easy to create chaos, brother.
Let me tell you...

31:20.041 --> 31:22.250
they will greet us
with their arms wide open.

31:24.041 --> 31:26.041
CIVIL GUARD

31:27.083 --> 31:28.625
Captain Garrido,

31:28.708 --> 31:31.083
First Squad, Sixth Company of BRIPAC.

31:31.166 --> 31:32.291
Lieutenant Alcázar.

31:32.375 --> 31:33.916
We're ordered to safeguard the building.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.750
I want all those people out.

31:39.458 --> 31:42.791
We need to widen the security perimeter
150 meters from the bank façade.

31:42.875 --> 31:45.875
And open the back doors.
There's a convoy on the way.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.500
Ladies, we're going in.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.500
We've received orders to coordinate,

31:53.125 --> 31:54.916
but not to allow a convoy to enter.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.875
Sir, the convoy is approaching.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.375
I shall not give that order to my men.

32:10.416 --> 32:12.375
Stop that convoy.

32:17.458 --> 32:19.166
<i>They're pulling us over, girls.</i>

32:21.416 --> 32:22.250
Sir.

32:23.208 --> 32:24.875
I request immediate entry.

32:26.916 --> 32:27.750
Jiménez.

32:29.625 --> 32:30.625
Give me your radio.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.625
<i>Staff Headquarters.</i>

32:37.708 --> 32:41.041
Lieutenant Alcázar speaking,
Civil Guard unit.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.833
I urgently request access confirmation
for the BRIPAC squad

32:43.916 --> 32:45.500
into the Bank of Spain.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.791
What the fuck is going on?

32:54.291 --> 32:58.000
<i>This is Lieutenant Colonel Castro.</i>
<i>Alert Level 5 has just been declared.</i>

32:58.083 --> 33:00.000
<i>I repeat, Alert Level 5. From now on,</i>

33:00.083 --> 33:03.833
the army will be in charge of the defense
within the Bank and its perimeter.

33:04.250 --> 33:07.083
So, start coordinating your men
and follow Captain Garrido's orders

33:07.166 --> 33:09.208
until Colonel Cerceda arrives,
do you copy?

33:15.000 --> 33:16.750
Yes, sir. Understood.

33:35.750 --> 33:37.416
Let's widen the security perimeter!

33:38.041 --> 33:40.666
I want all those lowlifes
on the other side of the street.

33:49.625 --> 33:51.875
Let's clear the area
until the squad arrives.

33:52.833 --> 33:54.375
Get the tear gas ready!

33:55.333 --> 33:57.416
And let's get the tear gas ready!

34:03.625 --> 34:05.458
Let them in. Authorization confirmed.

34:23.041 --> 34:25.625
Now we're finally in.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.791
Do you know what aikido is?

34:46.875 --> 34:48.333
Yes, an AC.

34:48.416 --> 34:52.666
No, those shitty thin chocolate sticks:
neither a snack nor an appetizer.

34:52.750 --> 34:55.333
Ai-ki-do.

34:55.416 --> 34:57.916
Using the enemy's force to your advantage.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.250
We alone can't break into
the Bank of Spain.

35:00.333 --> 35:02.666
The enemy's force
is much greater than ours.

35:02.750 --> 35:03.583
So...

35:05.833 --> 35:07.083
we shall apply aikido.

35:07.166 --> 35:09.208
How, aikido, Professor?

35:09.291 --> 35:11.208
Whatever we're not able to do

35:11.291 --> 35:13.541
will be done by the Civil Guard,

35:13.625 --> 35:16.583
the Spanish Army
and the bank's private security.

35:18.166 --> 35:21.416
<i>They will ensure that no one comes</i>
<i>closer than 150 meters from the building.</i>

35:22.625 --> 35:25.416
We'll find out the exact number
of hostages in the building.

35:25.875 --> 35:27.500
How many people are there in the building?

35:27.583 --> 35:30.541
The security staff will provide
the numbers.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.500
Three hundred and sixty-seven.

35:33.625 --> 35:34.458
Aikido.

35:34.541 --> 35:37.541
I want all 367 people here
in three minutes.

35:37.625 --> 35:38.833
<i>We'll place charges</i>

35:38.916 --> 35:42.666
on façades and windows, in broad daylight,
in the street and unseen. How?

35:42.750 --> 35:46.250
Thanks to the smoke the Civil Guards
will throw to clear the crowd.

35:46.875 --> 35:48.166
Aikido.

36:23.791 --> 36:25.416
<i>Evacuation protocol.</i>

36:25.500 --> 36:27.750
I want everyone down here
in three minutes.

36:27.833 --> 36:29.041
Move!

36:29.125 --> 36:30.958
<i>-This is not an evacuation drill.</i>
-Now.

36:31.041 --> 36:32.041
<i>Evacuation protocol.</i>

36:32.125 --> 36:34.541
We'll take the clients and employees
out of the building,

36:34.625 --> 36:36.041
following a strict protocol.

36:36.708 --> 36:37.541
How?

36:38.125 --> 36:39.875
Let's proceed with the evacuation.

36:39.958 --> 36:42.375
I want everyone down here right now!

36:47.666 --> 36:48.875
Evacuation protocol.

36:48.958 --> 36:50.250
Proceed in an orderly manner.

36:52.750 --> 36:55.166
<i>The Civil Guards and the security staff</i>
<i>will raid the building,</i>

36:55.250 --> 36:56.500
<i>office by office,</i>

36:56.583 --> 36:58.875
and will evacuate everyone
in less than three minutes.

36:58.958 --> 36:59.958
Aikido!

37:00.041 --> 37:01.791
Hurry up! Hurry up!

37:01.875 --> 37:03.458
Hurry up! Hurry up!

37:07.541 --> 37:09.541
Come on, hurry up!

37:09.625 --> 37:12.458
They'll help us get in all the material
we'll need for the job.

37:18.625 --> 37:19.500
Come on!

37:26.833 --> 37:27.666
Come on!

37:28.333 --> 37:30.416
Come on! Come on!

37:30.500 --> 37:32.750
Please, I need you all to keep calm.

37:33.208 --> 37:35.625
We will evacuate the building
in two groups:

37:35.875 --> 37:37.166
Group 1 and Group 2.

37:37.250 --> 37:39.125
And they will escort
the spare hostages out.

37:39.208 --> 37:41.958
They will all leave together
and will rid us of a problem.

37:42.041 --> 37:43.250
Aikido!

37:43.333 --> 37:44.666
Group 1, out now!

37:47.500 --> 37:49.750
-Don't move, don't move.
-Back off.

37:49.833 --> 37:50.875
Come on.

37:50.958 --> 37:54.291
Move forward, move forward! Go, go!

37:54.375 --> 37:55.958
Move forward, move forward!

37:56.041 --> 37:56.958
Go, go!

37:57.041 --> 37:57.916
Move forward!

37:58.000 --> 37:59.583
Don't stay there! Move!

37:59.666 --> 38:00.875
Everyone out!

38:02.041 --> 38:04.458
Don't stop moving!
Go to the end of the street!

38:04.541 --> 38:05.833
Move, move!

38:05.916 --> 38:07.125
Move!

38:08.041 --> 38:09.041
Keep walking!

38:18.708 --> 38:22.166
Move forward! Come on!

38:22.250 --> 38:23.708
Move, madam!

38:23.791 --> 38:25.041
<i>Then,</i>

38:25.125 --> 38:26.875
when everyone is where they have to be,

38:33.541 --> 38:35.125
we'll just need to push a button.

38:39.833 --> 38:40.833
And I'll push...

38:41.833 --> 38:43.041
<i>that button.</i>

39:12.750 --> 39:13.958
There's no turning back.
