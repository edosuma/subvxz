WEBVTT

00:29.863 --> 00:30.989
Oh, God.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.445
Aww, fuck!

01:12.280 --> 01:14.491
Well, congratulations.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.367
You're four and a half months pregnant.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.994
How is this even possible?

01:18.578 --> 01:20.371
I am a thousand years old.

01:21.331 --> 01:25.335
I mean, yeah, I-- I felt things,
but I-- I just thought it was menopause.

01:25.418 --> 01:28.797
Menopause and pregnancy
share some similar things.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.381
-So that's understandable.
-A nightmare.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.549
What?

01:31.633 --> 01:33.676
Well, the great news
is everyone's healthy.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.346
Tests and baby look good.
Would you like to know the sex?

01:36.429 --> 01:39.474
I would like to go back in time
and not have the sex.

01:39.557 --> 01:43.812
Jen, I understand this is a shock,
but it's also kind of a miracle.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.648
Do you know how many women
would kill to get pregnant at your age?

01:46.731 --> 01:48.233
Oh, fuck!

01:59.119 --> 02:00.245
Hi, Dr. Ashmani!

02:00.328 --> 02:01.663
Judy, hi.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.748
Hi. I come bearing gifts.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.751
Well, gift. I don't wanna oversell.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.671
Oh! Is that my boat?

02:09.754 --> 02:11.381
-Hope so.
-Oh.

02:11.464 --> 02:14.134
It's my first seascape,
and I painted it from memory.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.302
-Also, I've been eating a lot of pot, so…

02:16.386 --> 02:19.013
Well, it's beautiful and very kind.

02:19.097 --> 02:19.973
Thank you.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.933
Thank <i>you</i> for everything.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.685
I just wanted you to know.

02:23.768 --> 02:26.229
You were so right. I couldn't
have gone through all that alone.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.315
Oh, well, I'm just glad there was a friend
who was able to be there for you.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.984
Me too.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.944
I wish I could figure a way to repay her.

02:33.027 --> 02:36.030
Well, maybe after
you're finished with your treatment.

02:36.614 --> 02:37.991
I thought I was finished.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.951
Well, we still have to
go back in two weeks

02:40.034 --> 02:42.453
and test you to see if you
responded well to the chemo.

02:42.537 --> 02:45.039
Oh, yeah, right. I mean,
I think I probably responded pretty good

02:45.123 --> 02:46.499
'cause I feel pretty good.

02:47.458 --> 02:50.879
That's great, but odds are
you will still need another round.

02:50.962 --> 02:54.090
Yeah, I'm not really an odds person.
I don't really believe in 'em.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.845
Okay. Well, good for you.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.680
Honestly, a lot of my patients

03:00.763 --> 03:03.433
go in hard on Google,
and that can be very discouraging.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.559
No, yeah.

03:04.642 --> 03:07.937
I feel like what I don't know
can't hurt me. Right?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.814
What am I gonna do? 

03:09.898 --> 03:10.940
Is there…

03:11.858 --> 03:13.985
-Do you have a partner in the picture?
-Oh, gross.

03:14.068 --> 03:16.070
Don't say partner.
I'm not running a small business.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.406
I have a fucking human being in my body.

03:18.489 --> 03:21.117
And the person
that is responsible for this is in rehab.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.493
That's rough.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.288
So, I think I'm gonna hold off
on any big announcements

03:25.371 --> 03:26.456
until I'm finally showing.

03:27.081 --> 03:28.166
-Hmm.
-Hmm?

03:29.125 --> 03:30.001
-Am I?

03:30.084 --> 03:31.419
-No.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.588
Mm-hmm.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.343
Do you know of a Marshalls nearby?

03:40.011 --> 03:41.930
-Uh, hey.
-Hey!

03:42.013 --> 03:43.723
Oh, somebody got a new poncho.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.558
Yep, somebody did.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.769
Yeah, no, I-- I just saw it,
and I just thought,

03:47.852 --> 03:49.437
"I'm gonna-- I'm gonna get that poncho."

03:49.520 --> 03:52.607
"And I'm gonna--
I'm gonna wear that poncho."

03:52.690 --> 03:54.234
Yeah, wear that poncho.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.444
-What's, uh, this all about?

03:56.527 --> 03:58.279
Okay, it's just a little something

03:58.363 --> 04:01.074
to say thank you
for helping me get through the chemo.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.910
You don't have to thank me
for helping you get through chemo.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.788
I can thank you if I wanna thank you.
I wanted to take you somewhere fun.

04:06.871 --> 04:10.333
But I know you have work. So, I figured
why not bring the party to us?

04:11.417 --> 04:13.920
-Ta-da!
-Oh!

04:14.003 --> 04:15.213
It's a wine tasting!

04:15.296 --> 04:16.339
Wine.

04:16.422 --> 04:20.260
Yeah, these were all of your favorites
from the vineyards in Napa.

04:20.885 --> 04:23.930
That's so thoughtful
of you, honey. It's, um--

04:24.013 --> 04:25.640
Uh…

04:25.723 --> 04:28.851
-What's wrong?
-I'm doing dry January.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.436
-It's October.
-You know what I mean.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.354
Do I?

04:31.437 --> 04:33.564
Or does this
have something to do with Ben?

04:33.648 --> 04:35.566
-What? No!
-Like you're inspired.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.778
-It has nothing-- I'm not inspired.
-Yeah, like, sober in solidarity.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.655
You know,
you did say his name a couple times.

04:40.738 --> 04:41.948
-Eww!
-What?

04:42.031 --> 04:43.283
No, I am--

04:43.366 --> 04:46.244
I just, you know, I really
wanna focus on my health right now.

04:46.327 --> 04:51.291
Just try to make smarter choices
about what I… put in my body.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.626
Yeah, I hear you.
I mean, I shouldn't be drinking either.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.504
But I do get two weeks, no bad news.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.965
So, I figured I'll live
in that vacuum of joy,

04:59.048 --> 05:00.550
and wine is helpful there.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.427
Yeah, it is.

05:03.594 --> 05:06.472
Hey, you know,
I got a lot going on today, so…

05:06.556 --> 05:08.474
-I know. Your showing.
-What?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.352
-You're showing the house.
-Yes.

05:11.853 --> 05:15.148
Yep, yep, yep. I'm showin' a house.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.275
That is correctamundo.

05:17.358 --> 05:20.069
Um, yeah, I must have blocked it out
because, you know,

05:20.153 --> 05:22.697
the client is a pain in the a--

05:22.780 --> 05:25.908
And this is from a trip
when Jeff and I went to the Badlands,

05:25.992 --> 05:28.578
which is a real misnomer
because it's great there.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.288
Well, it'll be great in your new house.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.957
-Or in this box forever.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.419
I just don't understand
why we have to stage this place.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.087
It's already in great shape.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.674
Yeah, it's just
there's a lot of personality in here…

05:41.758 --> 05:43.885
-…and guns!

05:43.968 --> 05:47.055
Guns are a selling point in Orange County,
and personality is good.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.557
It depends
on the personality.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.933
Okay…

05:51.017 --> 05:53.686
I'll put 'em in my safe room.
You know…

05:53.770 --> 05:56.397
…I just don't understand
why Jeff insists on selling.

05:56.981 --> 06:00.151
He didn't want kids.
So, this house was kind of my baby.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.320
But you know, here's the thing, Karen,

06:02.403 --> 06:06.282
is that sometimes you just have to
accept the fact that this is your life,

06:06.366 --> 06:07.784
and you need to fucking deal,

06:07.867 --> 06:10.703
no matter how much you wish
things were very, very, very different.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.206
Jesus Christ! What is that smell?

06:13.706 --> 06:16.501
-Oh, it's my Yankee Candle collection.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.378
Of course it is. Why wouldn't it be?

06:18.461 --> 06:19.629
Bona fide wick-head here.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.922
-Great.
-Wanna sniff?

06:21.005 --> 06:22.882
-No, thanks.
-Orange dreamsicle.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.258
Nope!

06:24.342 --> 06:26.219
-But--
-Oh, no.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.764
Are you-- are you feeling okay?

06:29.847 --> 06:30.681
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.060
Something's different about you.

06:34.143 --> 06:34.977
No, it isn't.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.813
-Hey, there.
-Hey!

06:36.896 --> 06:38.439
-Oh!
-I know what it is.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.857
What?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.029
Your poncho.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.072
Isn't it great?

06:46.155 --> 06:47.949
-Yep.
-So roomy.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.076
-What you smugglin' in there?
-Nothing.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.121
Hey! Be careful with that.
That's from HomeGoods.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.372
Hi. What you doing here?

06:54.455 --> 06:56.374
Oh, I thought maybe
you guys might get hungry, so…

06:56.457 --> 06:59.710
Actually, I am hungry,
so whatcha-- whatcha got there?

06:59.794 --> 07:02.338
-Oh, Gorgonzola and chorizo.
-No.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.257
No?

07:06.801 --> 07:07.927
Okay.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.346
I just need some air.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.688
-Jen!

07:18.771 --> 07:20.022
Hey.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.775
Jesus fucking Christ. What the--

07:27.155 --> 07:28.281
<i>What am I looking at?</i>

07:28.948 --> 07:31.534
That is Jen Harding's kid
driving a banged-up Jeep

07:31.617 --> 07:33.661
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

07:33.744 --> 07:36.664
You mean the right place at the right time
to be our hit-and-run suspect?

07:36.747 --> 07:38.583
Right and wrong are subjective.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.334
I mean, what's wrong for him is right…

07:41.711 --> 07:43.129
Yes, that's what I mean.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.006
All right, hold on.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.508
You think the Harding kid
hit his own mother?

07:48.009 --> 07:49.093
That doesn't make any sense.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.221
Okay, at first, I didn't think so either,
but we know Charlie Harding

07:52.305 --> 07:54.724
was driving Steve Wood's car
when he went missing.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.727
Now he's driving this one?
Come on. What are the odds?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.146
Pretty low, but why
would he wanna hurt his own mother?

08:00.730 --> 08:02.690
Maybe he wanted to hurt Judy Hale.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.609
Look, she was in the car
that killed his father.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.861
So was Steve Wood.
Look what happened to him.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.654
Steve Wood's murder didn't have
anything to do with this.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.198
How-- how do you know?

08:10.781 --> 08:13.367
-I don't.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.785
Charlie had the motive.

08:15.369 --> 08:18.664
Not to mention, he was in the house
with the possible murder weapon.

08:18.748 --> 08:19.874
What murder weapon?

08:19.957 --> 08:21.042
The wooden bird.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.460
Hmm.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.590
You never heard back
from Agent Moranis about that, huh?

08:27.673 --> 08:30.051
Mm-mm. No, no. No word on the bird.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.053
Yeah, yeah.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.347
-I wonder if I should go follow up.
-No.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.641
We should bring the kid in.
I'll track down Mrs. Harding.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.600
Great. Let's go.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.644
No, I-- I should go alone.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.979
You know, try and talk
to her woman-to-woman.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.941
Uh, you try and isolate
the plates on that footage.

08:47.735 --> 08:48.653
What?

08:50.446 --> 08:51.447
Nothing.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.412
Ah! It's such a nice surprise to see you!

08:58.496 --> 09:01.541
Yes, big surprise. So many surprises.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.964
I, um… I thought you were in rehab.

09:08.047 --> 09:12.051
Oh, I was. Just, uh,
they sprung me loose.

09:12.134 --> 09:15.805
And now I'm, uh, at that step
where I'm making my amends.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.808
-Aww, great.
-Oh. You don't-- that's not necessary.

09:18.891 --> 09:19.725
Oh.

09:20.601 --> 09:23.437
And I'm-- I'm also here to say goodbye.

09:23.521 --> 09:26.107
-What? What? Where are you going?
-Goodbye?

09:26.857 --> 09:28.109
Uh…

09:28.192 --> 09:30.152
I gotta get back to my life up north.

09:30.236 --> 09:33.114
My practice, my son who's in college now,

09:33.197 --> 09:37.034
so he doesn't really, you know,
really care about Dada.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.452
Yeah, no, no, of course.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.579
Yeah.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.040
But also to be honest, there's a reason
why I left Laguna in the first place.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.959
A lot of bad memories here.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.253
Yeah, I hear ya.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.256
Yeah, and I know I can't

09:51.257 --> 09:54.010
make my amends to Him, but I can to you.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.637
So…

09:58.889 --> 10:01.017
I'm sorry for every

10:01.809 --> 10:03.894
uncomfortable thing
I ever put you through.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.522
-No problem. Seriously, all is forgiven.
-What? No, no, not at all.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.816
-All right? We good.
-Please. Yeah.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.152
Really? 'Cause I, uh…
There's actually more.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.612
-Here. I have a list.
-No!

10:12.695 --> 10:15.740
-No, you're fine. You're fine.
-No need. Come on. It's us.

10:16.574 --> 10:19.535
Wow. Okay.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.205
Thank you. Thanks.
God, I was nervous.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.665
You did great.

10:24.749 --> 10:25.875
You did.

10:27.668 --> 10:31.380
So… we're really gonna miss you, Ben.

10:32.506 --> 10:33.716
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

10:35.092 --> 10:37.553
Are you sure that you really need to go?

10:37.637 --> 10:40.473
If-- I-- I would only be staying
out of obligation to my parents.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.183
And so there's not really…

10:43.643 --> 10:46.228
I don't know, you know?
There's not really any other

10:47.188 --> 10:49.732
reason to… be here.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.908
-Hmm?
-Hmm.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.117
-What?

11:00.201 --> 11:01.577
I mean, you gotta go, you gotta go.

11:02.620 --> 11:06.040
-Might not have to go if you felt like…
-He has to go.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.792
-…people wanted you to stay.
-Kids, things.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.002
His kid isn't here.
He said he's in college.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.505
-He's cranky as fuck. He doesn't care.
-It's-- Okay.

11:13.130 --> 11:13.964
Right.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.842
Uh, cool.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.636
Well, I, um…

11:21.263 --> 11:22.973
I'm gonna go. I got, um…

11:23.057 --> 11:24.600
Listen. I love you both.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.560
And, I mean, you guys are so sweet

11:26.644 --> 11:29.146
and so nice to me
and so kind, and I hope that,

11:29.730 --> 11:32.900
you know, you know
how much that's-- that's meant to me.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.026
Aww.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.154
-We love you. Hmm?

11:37.238 --> 11:38.531
-Hmm.
-Oh.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.409
Aww.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.996
-So sweet of you.
-What?

11:51.585 --> 11:55.297
All right, well, um, yeah. See ya later.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.267
Yeah, okay. Later gator.

12:06.350 --> 12:09.145
In a while cr-- Bye.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.480
-I'll walk you out.
-Okay.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.358
-Ooh! You all right?
-Bye.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.243
Oh, my God!

12:24.326 --> 12:25.578
Oh, my God!

12:25.661 --> 12:27.872
Why didn't you say anything?

12:27.955 --> 12:30.458
-What are you talking about?
-The pregnant pause.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.502
-He was waiting for you to say something.
-To say what?

12:33.586 --> 12:36.088
That you want him to stay,
that you have feelings for him.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.007
Eww, I don't have feel-- No, I don't.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.718
Ugh, please. You said his name twice
when we were tripping.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.887
Um, I'm sorry, I was tripping.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.513
Okay, you fell on his dick twice too.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.514
-Really?
-Yeah.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.058
How many things you do twice
before you admit that you love him?

12:48.142 --> 12:49.351
I don't love him.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.436
I don't believe you.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.856
I-- I can't even--
I can't even look at him, okay?

12:54.523 --> 12:55.900
I killed his fucking brother.

12:55.983 --> 12:59.195
-His fucking brother killed your husband.
-Yeah, well, he doesn't know that.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.946
Well, maybe he should.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.742
What if we just told him
the truth about everything?

13:04.825 --> 13:06.285
Don't you think he could forgive you?

13:06.368 --> 13:08.537
No, I absolutely do not think that.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.456
Well, you forgave him for the hit-and-run.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.833
Okay, that is not the same.
You can't tit-for-tat that.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.585
We tit-for-tatted.

13:14.668 --> 13:17.588
I told you the truth about Ted,
then, yeah, we went through a rough patch

13:17.671 --> 13:19.924
where you threatened to shoot me
and then you killed Steve,

13:20.007 --> 13:21.759
but you were honest.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.385
And look at us now.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.387
Yeah, yeah, look at us. You have cancer,

13:25.471 --> 13:27.515
and I'm about three seconds away
from being arrested.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.600
Okay, you don't know that.

13:29.683 --> 13:33.479
But I know that no matter
how much shit we put each other through,

13:33.562 --> 13:35.648
somehow we're still best friends, right?

13:36.690 --> 13:37.525
Right.

13:37.608 --> 13:40.611
Because we tell each other
the truth, right?

13:42.112 --> 13:43.155
No, we do.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.287
I'm pregnant.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.124
What? No.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.669
Yeah, why do you think I've been wearing
this stupid-ass poncho?

13:56.752 --> 13:57.837
Just there it is.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.844
Oh, my God! With…?

14:05.344 --> 14:07.513
Yeah. Yeah, it's really fucked.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.723
I'm so sorry.

14:10.307 --> 14:14.061
No. No, that is-- How far along are you?

14:14.144 --> 14:15.479
Just too far.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.691
Wow.

14:19.608 --> 14:22.361
That is amazing.
I mean, I can't even believe it.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.654
-It's, like, amazing.
-Okay--

14:23.737 --> 14:25.406
Judy, you are allowed to say how you feel.

14:25.489 --> 14:27.867
Yeah, no, I am. I am.
I mean, it is amazing.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.869
Okay.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.121
I just, um…

14:33.831 --> 14:36.542
-I just need a minute.

14:37.459 --> 14:40.087
-I-- I know. Ju-- Judy, can we please--
-I need a minute.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.131
Okay. Oh, shit.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.259
-Mom?
-What?

14:45.342 --> 14:46.927
Charlie threw the iPad at me.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.346
Oh, for fuck's sake!

14:50.139 --> 14:51.432
Fuck!

14:52.308 --> 14:54.476
Come here. Are you okay?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.270
-Yeah.
-Do you need a hug?

14:56.353 --> 14:57.313
Okay.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.159
<i>I love you.</i>

15:10.242 --> 15:11.160
<i>I love you.</i>

15:12.202 --> 15:13.203
And you too.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.999
-<i>What happened?</i>

15:17.082 --> 15:20.544
<i> I really thought</i>
<i>that I was gonna have a baby and a family.</i>

15:31.597 --> 15:33.974
-What were you thinking?
-I was throwing it to him.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.851
It's not my fault that he has no reflexes.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.603
You guys are too old for this shit.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.105
-I am too old for this shit.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.818
Shit.

15:45.402 --> 15:46.362
Who is it?

15:47.863 --> 15:49.782
You're telling me that's not Charlie?

15:49.865 --> 15:52.034
No, it is, but I am telling you

15:52.117 --> 15:54.870
that he wasn't driving the car
when it hit us, okay?

15:54.954 --> 15:57.373
No, I've never been
more confused in my life.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.793
The point is he didn't hit us.
You just have to trust me.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.086
Why would I do that?

16:02.169 --> 16:03.212
Because…

16:03.879 --> 16:05.339
Because I know who did.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.800
-Who did?
-I'm not telling.

16:07.883 --> 16:08.759
Jesus Christ, woman!

16:08.842 --> 16:11.512
Do you know how many hours
we've put into trying to solve this thing?

16:11.595 --> 16:13.472
Yes, a lot, and now you can stop.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.724
Oh, and you can stop telling me
what I can and can't do.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.935
I'm not pressing charges,
so it doesn't matter anyway.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.853
I need to know who did it.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.189
-And I said I can't tell you!

16:24.566 --> 16:27.027
Then maybe Charlie won't mind opening up.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.948
Ben. It was Ben Wood.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.325
What?

16:33.409 --> 16:35.077
It was an accident.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.371
-It was a hit-and-run.
-Yeah, and he's sorry.

16:37.454 --> 16:40.290
-Oh, he's sorry. Hmm?
-Yes, yes. He just made amends.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.917
Oh, so he'd been drinking.

16:42.001 --> 16:42.835
No.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.545
I-- I don't know, okay?

16:44.628 --> 16:47.881
Just please, just promise me
that you won't do anything to him.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.801
I can't do that. I'm not
your goddamn sorority sister. I'm a cop.

16:50.884 --> 16:53.929
-Please. He's been through enough already.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.222
I just wanna let him go.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.933
And so what? You don't
wanna press charges out of guilt?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.018
No.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.312
-Maybe, but mostly, I don't--
-Because you are thinking

17:02.396 --> 17:05.274
he's gonna take it easy on you
once he finds out what you did?

17:05.357 --> 17:06.191
No.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.737
-You just don't understand.
-Then explain it to me.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.119
I'm pregnant.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.414
I'm pregnant, okay?

17:21.165 --> 17:23.584
So, what's that got to do with-- Oh, shit.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.678
Hey.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.721
You chilly?

17:36.889 --> 17:38.974
-Can I have your poncho?

17:39.058 --> 17:41.226
You can have anything you want.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.145
-There.
-Thanks.

17:47.524 --> 17:48.984
I'm so sorry, Judy.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.613
Don't be sorry.
You're not having a baby at me.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.115
Yeah, well,
I shouldn't be having one at all.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.658
Just--

17:57.451 --> 17:59.870
-I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
-Yes, you do.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.038
No, barely.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.042
I mean, Ted. Ted did everything. And, um…

18:06.710 --> 18:09.713
I mean, he was a shit husband,
but he was--

18:09.797 --> 18:12.758
he was a-- he was a good… mom.

18:13.675 --> 18:14.760
So are you.

18:15.886 --> 18:19.098
You're a better mother than I am.
I mean, everybody knows it.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.182
-Stop.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.019
I can't do this alone, Jude.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.689
If you wanna repay me
for helping you through chemo,

18:27.773 --> 18:28.982
please help me through this.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.193
What about Ben?

18:31.735 --> 18:32.903
W-what about him?

18:33.529 --> 18:34.530
You have to tell him.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.823
No, I can't.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.660
That would be, like, entrapment.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.831
-Hmm. No.
-Maybe not entrapment. I-- wait.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.667
-I don't feel that is the real meaning.
-Is it entrapment?

18:46.750 --> 18:49.670
Anyway, it's-- it just wouldn't be fair.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.759
He deserves to know.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.846
-All of it.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.267
And then maybe he can process it,

19:03.350 --> 19:06.311
and, I mean, that'll take a minute, but…

19:08.605 --> 19:10.649
maybe you guys can have a life together.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.318
I already have a life.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.611
And a partner.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.696
Ooh, I hate that word.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.197
-Yeah, it's gross.
-Yeah.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.867
But it applies here.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.970
<i>Hey, Charlie Brown,</i>
<i>what do you think?</i>

20:22.054 --> 20:23.222
<i>What's Mommy got in her belly?</i>

20:23.305 --> 20:25.182
<i>Is it a bagel?</i>

20:25.265 --> 20:26.808
<i>I think he just thinks I'm fat.</i>

20:26.892 --> 20:30.687
<i>No. What do you think, Char?</i>
<i>Is it a baby?</i>

20:31.563 --> 20:33.023
<i>Do you wanna be a big brother?</i>

20:45.619 --> 20:46.912
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:47.913 --> 20:48.997
Can we talk?

20:57.798 --> 20:59.967
-Hey, can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.886
-You think I'm stupid?
-Uh, what?

21:02.970 --> 21:06.640
I followed up with Agent Moranis.
I know you never sent him the bird.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.602
Nick, look. I can-- I can explain--

21:10.686 --> 21:13.480
No, no, you don't have to.
I know what's going on here.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.398
You do?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.946
You think I'm a bad cop.
You think I'm crazy.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.489
Oh, no.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.324
No, no, no, I don't.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.285
Then what other explanation is there?

21:26.368 --> 21:30.289
Every time I have a theory about anything,
you just make this face, like…

21:30.998 --> 21:32.207
-No, I don't.
-You just did.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.418
-You can't stop it.
-I'm not. I did not.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.461
-What? What do you-- no.
-You just did it.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.088
That's what-- you do. Look…

21:40.340 --> 21:42.384
I was fucked up after I lost my partner,

21:42.467 --> 21:46.930
and you took a chance on me when--
when no one else would, and I'm grateful.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.016
Because you know this job, it's…

21:49.099 --> 21:50.726
…it's all I really care about.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.687
-Me too.
-But I'm tired of being sidelined.

21:53.770 --> 21:57.024
I know you're a good cop,
but I am too.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.193
And I deserve to be treated like it.

22:00.819 --> 22:01.945
You owe me that.

22:04.531 --> 22:05.532
You're right.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.659
I do.

22:11.663 --> 22:14.833
He dropped his ice cream.
I don't know what was going on here.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.503
Okay, that was good.

22:18.587 --> 22:21.131
Oh, my gosh.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.050
What are you guys--
What are you guys watching?

22:23.133 --> 22:24.176
Can I see?

22:24.259 --> 22:25.802
-You wanna see?
-Yeah!

22:25.886 --> 22:28.055
-Think fast.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.681
Oh, you wanna…

22:29.765 --> 22:31.308
Reflexes?

22:32.309 --> 22:34.644
Think fast!

22:34.728 --> 22:38.315
-You think fast too. You think fast too.

22:38.398 --> 22:40.150
I'll get you so bad.

22:40.233 --> 22:42.361
-Oh, I'm gonna get you.
-Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo!

22:42.444 --> 22:44.363
-Stop!

22:44.446 --> 22:46.031
-Wait.
-Right behind the ear!

22:46.114 --> 22:49.910
-Stop that. Stop! Stop!
-You did! Stop hitting me. You stop it!

22:56.500 --> 22:58.502
Hey, where have you been?

22:58.585 --> 23:00.629
Finding the best way to repay you.

23:01.630 --> 23:04.132
-Judy, I thought we discussed our terms.
-I know.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.010
But odds are that I might not

23:08.220 --> 23:12.182
always be able to be here for you
in the way that I wish that I could.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.643
What are you talking about? Odds?

23:14.726 --> 23:16.186
You know what I'm talking about.

23:16.269 --> 23:17.646
Oh.

23:17.729 --> 23:21.942
Come on. I got pregnant at 47, okay?
Fuck the odds.

23:22.025 --> 23:24.569
-They don't apply to us.

23:24.653 --> 23:28.073
Oh, my God. Remind me to rip
that goddamn doorbell out.

23:29.282 --> 23:30.409
It's for you.

23:34.037 --> 23:34.871
Hey.

23:35.455 --> 23:38.208
-Hi.
-Uh, I know I said goodbye already.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.919
But Judy came by

23:41.002 --> 23:44.423
and told me some things that I-- yeah.

23:47.008 --> 23:47.843
Um,

23:48.677 --> 23:50.137
and it all makes sense.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.766
Now I know why you can
barely look at me most of the time.

23:55.308 --> 23:56.143
You do?

23:56.893 --> 23:59.813
Mm-hmm. Because every time you look at me…

24:02.107 --> 24:04.359
…you see the face of the man that…

24:06.653 --> 24:08.155
that killed your husband.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.282
Oh.

24:10.907 --> 24:13.994
And I know Steve isn't here
to make amends.

24:14.077 --> 24:18.123
-So let me say I'm sorry for us both.

24:18.206 --> 24:22.085
You don't have to apologize.
You had nothing to do with it.

24:23.795 --> 24:24.963
But I did.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.967
Oh, hey!

24:29.050 --> 24:31.219
Congrats again, Steverino.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.971
Drunk again. Surprise, surprise.

24:33.054 --> 24:35.557
Now you think you're gonna drive,
you fucking loser?

24:35.640 --> 24:36.558
-Steve, don't.
-No!

24:36.641 --> 24:39.227
-Hey, don't push her, you fucking bully.
-Stop, you guys.

24:39.311 --> 24:42.314
Fine. Go kill somebody,
you piece of shit. See if I care.

24:42.397 --> 24:43.482
I know you don't.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.733
I feel sorry for you.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.610
You know who I feel sorry for?

24:47.402 --> 24:48.361
That kid.

24:48.445 --> 24:52.407
It has to grow up with you as a father,
'cause I'd rather kill myself!

24:55.076 --> 24:56.369
We have to go back!

24:56.453 --> 24:58.288
Drive the fucking car, stupid!

24:59.664 --> 25:01.958
-What happened?
-We-- we hit a--

25:02.042 --> 25:03.418
We hit a deer.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.219
They were driving me home.

25:13.303 --> 25:14.304
Oh, my God.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.518
I would have told you,
but I thought Ben should know first.

25:20.352 --> 25:23.939
I just think it's fair
that everybody know everything.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.441
Yeah.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.737
I don't want any secrets between us.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.323
Me neither. Me neither.

25:34.407 --> 25:35.325
Ben…

25:42.958 --> 25:45.001
-What's going on?
-What are you doing here?

25:45.085 --> 25:45.919
My job.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.837
-Hey, Nick.

25:48.630 --> 25:49.673
Is everything okay?

25:51.341 --> 25:54.177
You're under arrest for the hit-and-run
of Jen Harding and Judy Hale.

25:55.762 --> 25:58.807
-What?

26:02.060 --> 26:02.936
I'm sorry.

26:03.019 --> 26:05.480
You have the right
to remain silent. Anything you say can

26:05.564 --> 26:07.357
and will be used
against you in a court of law.

26:07.941 --> 26:11.236
-You have the right to an attorney.

26:11.319 --> 26:12.862
Oh, fuck.
