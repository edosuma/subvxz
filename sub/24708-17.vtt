an argument on the street?

like an execution, huh?

-It's a guessing game with him.

for us, Rudy--

13:27.973 --> 13:29.934

Big supporter of the job.

This guy we brought in

we like for the homicide.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.859
Uh, while we're
working up the crime scene,

15:01.859 --> 15:05.279
this kid walks in
with a bloodied-up hand he
supposedly got fixing a tranny.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.449
There's a blood trail
outside the back door
of this transmission place.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.868
Leads to the A.T.M. where
this kid made a withdrawal from.

15:10.868 --> 15:14.121
Yeah, we think he took out
the money to account for having
the proceeds from the robbery.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.874
Yeah. He took the money out
to cover the robbery. Then he
puts himself down the sreet...

15:16.874 --> 15:21.170
-at a jeweler taking out a
gift on layaway.
-So, um, the jeweler backs him?

15:21.170 --> 15:24.256
Yeah. Says he was there, but
he was acting awfully nervous.

15:24.256 --> 15:27.551
Jeweler says he thought
he was gonna rob him.

15:27.551 --> 15:31.639
Anyways, uh, we're gonna see
what we get from the father
and then go back at the kid.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.141
Yeah.

15:34.141 --> 15:38.103
Uh, Lieu, uh, as we're leaving
this transmission place,
James spoke aside to me.

15:38.103 --> 15:41.774
This kid did everything but wear
an "arrest me" sign on his back.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.282
Nothing like building up
the boss's expectations.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.992
You think that was
too much fanfare?

15:51.992 --> 15:55.162
-Thanks, Maxine.
-Okay.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.709
You got my son in here?

16:00.709 --> 16:04.421
Yeah. We, uh, need
some further information
from Danny.

16:04.421 --> 16:08.008
Mr. DeMarco, uh, do you know
if Mr. Eigen had anyone
angry at him?

16:08.008 --> 16:10.886
This was a straight-arrow guy.
He didn't gamble.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.347
He didn't do drugs.
He didn't run around.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.225
Did your son
get along with Mel?

16:16.225 --> 16:18.894
My son doesn't get on
with anyone. Got a drug problem.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.772
-Can't keep a job.
-He was working
for you and Mel.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.942
Mel was nice enough.
He suggested hiring Danny.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.903
You know, let him move out
of my and my wife's apartment.

16:27.903 --> 16:30.072
Kid doesn't have one friend.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.117
Not one person to call,

16:33.117 --> 16:36.578
Mr. DeMarco, do you know
Danny to be violent?

16:36.578 --> 16:38.789
I don't know.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.750
Does he own a gun,
you know?

16:41.750 --> 16:45.963
Where was he anyhow?
He should've been doing
repairs there.

16:47.423 --> 16:51.176
Danny says that he stepped out
to, uh, pick up a present
for your wife.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.223
-I want to talk to him.
-Not right now, Mr. DeMarco.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.686
-Are you done with me?
-Yeah. You can go for now.

17:02.187 --> 17:07.026
You tell him if he did this,
I hope he burns in hell.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.654

17:23.250 --> 17:25.252
Yeah. We just finished, Danny.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.464
-Is he horrified?
-He's pretty broken up.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.883
Because he and Mel were
best friends 30 years.

17:30.883 --> 17:35.012
He tells us you didn't
normally go out for errands
in the middle of a working day.

17:35.012 --> 17:38.724
W-Well, today I went
to go pick up earrings
I'd bought for my mother.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.061
-I got 'em with me.
-We stopped by that jeweler
goin' to pick up your dad.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.022
He said you had
those earrings on layaway
since four months back.

17:45.022 --> 17:50.110
Well, I'd saved enough by now.
It's not like Mel and my dad
paid me a king's salary.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.907
Are you directing
suspicion at me?

17:54.907 --> 17:57.743
Danny, your wrench injury's
consistent...

17:57.743 --> 18:00.245
with what might happen
in some type of altercation.

18:00.245 --> 18:04.708
I explained
every single aspect--

18:04.708 --> 18:06.919
my blood,
my whereabouts.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.422
I resent the implication
because there's a killer
on the loose.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.425
MARTINEZ:
Do you own a gun, Danny?
-No.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.303
I went to work.
I did my repairs.

18:16.303 --> 18:20.015
I took a break,
which I am entitled to,
and then Mel was dead.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.309
That is my story.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.439

-Yeah.

to go to the hospital?

19:08.856 --> 19:12.651
Um, Tina was on the couch.

19:12.651 --> 19:16.071
Uh, just for a minute
I went into the kitchen
to get a juice bar.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.287
No. I would hear
and come right away.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.581

Amy, the doctor said
Tina's head injuries...

she'd have gotten falling

-Get you frustrated?
-No. Oh, no.

shake 'em to get 'em to stop.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.958
Did you ever see Amy
be rough with Tina?

25:42.958 --> 25:44.626
It must be her.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.921
Want to be with Tina.
Want to go.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.839
Thanks for coming in.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.675
RUSSELL:
Thank you.

25:57.013 --> 26:00.392
I'm going to the hospital
to get a statement
from the admitting intern.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.816
So how you
holding up, Wanda?

26:07.816 --> 26:10.277
-It's hard, you know.
-Did we hear that story right--

26:10.277 --> 26:14.197
the head of that diaper
company's gonna be putting up
money for the baby?

26:14.197 --> 26:17.701
Yeah, he heard on the radio what
happened to Tony. He's gonna
help with the baby's expenses.

26:17.701 --> 26:20.870
-So that's a good break.
-Yeah, it's gonna help.

26:20.870 --> 26:24.416
We, uh, need you to pick
Tony's shooter out, Wanda.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.294
-(laughs) You think so?
-Nobody's talking
about testimony.

26:27.294 --> 26:31.298
No, you pick him out
in the lineup. He's gonna
be lookin' to deal.

26:31.298 --> 26:34.134
-You think so?
-Yeah, that's what we think,
Wanda. You think different?

26:34.134 --> 26:38.221
But you think he'll plead out?
You don't know the Crown Jewel.

26:38.221 --> 26:41.141
Which does hint to Wanda's
awareness on Tony's assailant.

26:41.141 --> 26:44.102
Mm-hmm. This, uh, head
of the diaper company--

26:44.102 --> 26:45.562
-Mr. Altmayer.
-Mr. Altmayer, right.

26:45.562 --> 26:50.108
Publicity fanatic. You know,
Post comes out, he ain't in it,
guy goes to bed with a migraine.

26:50.108 --> 26:53.028
Mr. Altmayer finds out
that you did the right
thing here, Wanda,

26:53.028 --> 26:56.239
you're gonna be looking
at a lot more than diaper money.

26:56.239 --> 26:57.616
-You think so?
-Oh, yeah.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.327
"Widowed Mother-To-Be
Stands Up To Fiancé's Killers;

27:00.327 --> 27:03.997

From Gang's Clutches."

27:03.997 --> 27:07.667
I'll tell you something else,
Wanda. A guy like this steps in,
he makes a long-term commitment.

27:07.667 --> 27:11.171
They don't want
no embarrassment afterwards,
anything bad happens to you.

27:11.171 --> 27:14.215
We're talking about
a lifestyle makeover here.

27:15.175 --> 27:17.177
You think so?

27:17.177 --> 27:19.387
Absolutely.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.939
I'll tell you who did it
and pick him out.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.819
CAPTAIN:
Man, this Danny DeMarco
interview--

27:34.819 --> 27:38.239
I'm not gonna pretend
One P.P.'s not puttin' my feet
to the fire somewhat.

27:38.239 --> 27:40.200
We recognize the position
you're in, Captain.

27:40.200 --> 27:45.413
I'm not gonna put Lt. Fancy in
the middle, which is why I wanna
speak to both of youse directly.

27:45.413 --> 27:46.998
I'm not gonna put you
in the middle kibitzing...

27:46.998 --> 27:49.125
how you run your interview
or conduct your case.

27:49.125 --> 27:51.211
So what would be
your point, Captain?

27:51.211 --> 27:54.881
-The point is, don't be shy.
-Meaning?

27:54.881 --> 27:58.051
Meaning I'm not gonna advocate
one interrogation technique
from another,

27:58.051 --> 28:01.971
but we want a statement
from this asshole before anyone
gets too much older.

28:01.971 --> 28:03.723
And if the room's got
the wrong population,

28:03.723 --> 28:07.394
I think we're all adults,
and we're prepared to sacrifice
for the good of the whole.

28:07.394 --> 28:10.563
So why does that sound like
"Don't walk him, but don't
give him anything to hit"?

28:10.563 --> 28:15.026
Arthur, if that's
what you heard, you're
not listening right.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.696
I got nothin'
against timely hits.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.912
(door opens, closes)

28:25.912 --> 28:28.790
Deal with him the way
you think is right.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.878
I want to be more helpful.
I really do.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.631
Yeah? Then you should be
more candid, Danny.

28:36.631 --> 28:41.636
I wish I could say more,
because there are layers
and sides to every story.

28:41.636 --> 28:45.932
So, uh, what's preventing you
from exploring those?

28:45.932 --> 28:49.436
You ever find yourself
the odd man out?

28:49.436 --> 28:50.895
Sure.

28:50.895 --> 28:54.190
Out in the cold? Third wheel?
Which is an unpleasant thing.

28:54.190 --> 28:59.112
-Absolutely.
-That was my situation
at my workplace.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.406
Mel and my dad
are big pals.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.908
Go to lunch every single day
while I brown-bag it.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.703
Hurt your feelings?

29:06.703 --> 29:09.706
(laughs)
I put up with it, you know--

29:09.706 --> 29:12.709
them bein' all buddy-buddy
with their jokes.

29:14.794 --> 29:18.590
But, uh, then
they'd laugh at me...

29:19.966 --> 29:22.677
and boss me...

29:22.677 --> 29:26.014
and say I don't do a good job.

29:26.014 --> 29:29.684
Did, uh, Mel
laugh at you yesterday?

29:29.684 --> 29:32.562
I mean, it just isn't
common courtesy--

29:32.562 --> 29:37.567
call someone stupid
and a moron...

29:37.567 --> 29:42.572
and at the same time showin'
everlasting love for Mel.

29:42.572 --> 29:45.158
-This is your dad now?
-Both.

29:45.158 --> 29:50.413
Both of them best friends
makin' me feel like dirt.

29:50.413 --> 29:52.999
Danny, did all
this resentment,

29:52.999 --> 29:56.586
plus, uh, inadequate wages,
how you felt the case--

29:56.586 --> 30:00.298
-Did you finally do
something about that?
-No.

30:00.298 --> 30:03.218
-(clattering)
-Jerkin' us around
a little, Danny?

30:03.218 --> 30:06.387
-Lead up to bein' cooperative,
then yank the rug out?
-No.

30:06.387 --> 30:09.766
There's other ways we can go
where you'll wish you took the
chance my partner's giving you.

30:09.766 --> 30:13.061
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You're on the methadone
maintenance, right?

30:13.061 --> 30:16.481
My program gives me up,
that's breach of confidence.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.275
I figure you got good and loaded
before you did what you did
this morning,

30:19.275 --> 30:21.611
not worried at all,
jonesing in here.

30:21.611 --> 30:25.824
I am not worried
because I'm innocent.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.535
You're not worried because
you think your alibi's solid,

30:28.535 --> 30:31.663
and you're still feeling good
from your dose, right?

30:31.663 --> 30:33.498
What you're leavin' out,
Danny, is the chance...

30:33.498 --> 30:37.085
you might get your ass kicked
till you wish you were dead.

30:44.884 --> 30:46.636
I didn't do it,

30:47.470 --> 30:50.306
and you're not gonna
make me say that I did.

31:08.950 --> 31:12.662
-I think I gotta tune him up.
-Thing is, James, he's
not going for a lawyer.

31:12.662 --> 31:16.457
-Indicating what?
-Indicating some aspect
he wants to be forthcoming.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.209
How about it's indicating
he thinks he's got
all the answers...

31:18.209 --> 31:21.838
for circumstantial evidence,
and he's getting off
on breaking our balls?

31:21.838 --> 31:25.592
-I differ on tuning him up.
-'Cause of your "genie's
out of the bottle" experience?

31:25.592 --> 31:29.387
-I don't think
it's right for this kid.
-Clock's running on this, Greg.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.806
We don't move him soon,
I'm going upside his head.

31:41.691 --> 31:42.984
It's 4:00, Lieutenant.

31:42.984 --> 31:46.154
-Do you know where your
Eigen investigation is?
-Give it a rest, Cohen.

31:46.154 --> 31:49.240
-Got your crack detectives
Martinez and Medavoy on this.
-Meaning what?

31:49.240 --> 31:53.202
Dead guy had a lot of juice.
I don't think you wanna come
out of the jungle empty-handed.

31:53.202 --> 31:56.372
Lieu, Diane's on her way back.
The baby died.

31:56.372 --> 31:59.000
-The babysitter
make a statement?
-We'll go back at her now.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.169
She's a baby killer.
Why the lack of enthusiasm?

32:01.169 --> 32:03.546
Oh, kiss my ass, Cohen.

32:03.546 --> 32:06.466
Not an entirely
unappealing thought.

32:06.466 --> 32:11.054
She adored this kid, Lieu.
Forty entries a day
in a journal.

32:11.054 --> 32:13.348
Every hiccup
the kid made.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.350
But do you think
she did it?

32:15.350 --> 32:17.352
I don't think the parents
would've taken the time.

MARTINEZ:
Thanks, Josh.

32:39.749 --> 32:42.168
About time I go.

32:42.168 --> 32:45.380
Yeah, Danny?
You get enough jollies
tellin' us lies?

32:45.380 --> 32:48.049
We'd like to talk to you
a little more, Danny,

32:48.049 --> 32:50.259
on this morning's
circumstances.

32:50.259 --> 32:53.805
-Meaning your boss's death.
-One of my boss's death.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.307
Right, yeah. Your dad's
your other boss.

32:56.307 --> 32:59.435
Not that he wouldn't rather
that I was out of his life
altogether.

32:59.435 --> 33:05.024
You know, I tried suicide
three times.

33:05.024 --> 33:09.112
And believe me, my dad
never cried at my bedside...

33:09.112 --> 33:11.864
like I know
he's cryin' over Mel.

33:11.864 --> 33:14.200
You know, you're
a sniveling little asshole.

33:14.200 --> 33:18.871
Why shouldn't your dad grieve
over his friend getting killed?
Why should that make you
jealous?

33:18.871 --> 33:21.040
He's not begrudging
this grieving, James.

33:21.040 --> 33:25.753
But-But his dad not showing
equivalent sympathy when
Danny was down himself--

33:25.753 --> 33:28.965
Or maybe he was laughing,
makin' fun,

33:28.965 --> 33:32.677
like "You can't even
kill yourself right,
you worthless jerk."

33:32.677 --> 33:34.554
Oh, Danny, take it easy.

33:34.554 --> 33:37.515
You think that I
am jerking you around?

33:37.515 --> 33:41.519
You think that I
am not genuinely upset?

33:41.519 --> 33:44.605
My life is a failure.

33:44.605 --> 33:47.692
You think I'm glad
I'm on methadone maintenance...

33:47.692 --> 33:50.945

cares two cents about me?

33:50.945 --> 33:53.031
Well, put me on that list,
you creepy little jerk.

-Well, put me on the top.

God.

33:59.912 --> 34:02.790
I am so unhappy.

Come here, Danny.

34:09.922 --> 34:13.092
Come here and let it out.

I would've killed
both of them...

Tina died an hour ago.

Oh, no.

35:26.958 --> 35:31.587

Oh, no. Poor baby. No.

35:33.381 --> 35:36.467
The doctor said
whatever happened...

35:36.467 --> 35:39.470
absolutely didn't
have to be intentional,

35:39.470 --> 35:43.224
but Tina died from someone
shaking her too hard.

35:47.687 --> 35:51.065
Amy, anyone could tell
from looking at that journal
you kept...

35:51.065 --> 35:53.109
how much you loved
and cared for Tina.

35:55.027 --> 35:57.989
I-- I loved her.

35:57.989 --> 36:01.868

I took care of her
the best I could.

36:01.868 --> 36:06.247
-But now she's dead.
-No. No. Don't.

36:10.543 --> 36:14.297
I fed her and cleaned her.

you know.

36:34.108 --> 36:37.195
No, no, no.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.656
My mother, she's very sick
in last year,

36:40.656 --> 36:46.662
and they loaned me money
for the medicine.

36:46.662 --> 36:50.374
I can't--
I can't lose this job.

they said they'd fire me...

36:57.840 --> 36:59.592
if she falls asleep.

37:02.178 --> 37:05.640
But the baby is so tired.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.851

-Yeah, but I gotta fess up.
