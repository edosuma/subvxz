WEBVTT

00:10.211 --> 00:11.612
*

00:11.712 --> 00:14.348
- You know, Charlotte,
that hat was given to me

00:14.448 --> 00:17.385
by an old Greek fisherman
named Charalampos.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.553
He only had one eye
and two teeth,

00:19.653 --> 00:21.355
but he was full of wisdom.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.291
- Hey, Zoo, did you
wash that thing

00:23.391 --> 00:24.592
before you stuck it
on your niece's head?

00:24.692 --> 00:26.294
- Absolutely not.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.362
This hat is encrusted
with the salty residue

00:28.462 --> 00:30.298
of the mighty Aegean.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.500
Which reminds me,
I brought you something.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.302
- Oh, I hope it's not fish.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.637
- It's fish.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.407
- Yep, scooped from the waters
by Charalampos himself.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.275
- Well, then they can go
right back in the water

00:41.375 --> 00:43.144
because our fridge is
already full of casseroles

00:43.244 --> 00:45.045
that people keep
bringing by for Emma.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.547
- She's actually doing amazing.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.382
- Yeah, she's doing

00:48.482 --> 00:50.084
this cold-cap thing
where they freeze your scalp

00:50.184 --> 00:51.419
so you get to keep
most of your hair.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.487
- Oh, that's too bad.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.456
- Well, I always thought
Emma had a beautiful cranium.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.558
- Ugh, why does it smell like
Red Lobster in here?

00:57.658 --> 00:59.593
- Don't ask.
- Oh, Zach, yes,

00:59.693 --> 01:01.329
that makes sense.
How was Greece?

01:01.429 --> 01:03.164
- It was transformative.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.433
I met a man named Charalampos--
- Snooze.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.401
Mags, what's up
with all these owls?

01:07.501 --> 01:09.537
- They were for ladies' craft
night, but I decided to cancel.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.205
You love craft night.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.573
- I know, but it's gonna be,
like, two days

01:12.673 --> 01:14.342
after your third chemo,
and I want to be able

01:14.442 --> 01:16.177
to take care of you.
I don't know

01:16.277 --> 01:17.545
how you're gonna feel.
- I'm gonna feel fine.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.447
- You didn't feel fine
last time.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.649
- Hey, nothing has to change
just 'cause I have cancer, okay?

01:21.749 --> 01:24.585
You'll do your craft night, and
I'll just be upstairs per usual,

01:24.685 --> 01:26.320
watching
"Bridget Jones's Diary."

01:26.420 --> 01:28.589
- You want me to leave you
all alone upstairs

01:28.689 --> 01:30.524
while we're downstairs
painting owls

01:30.624 --> 01:34.162
and having the time of our life
at our summer "s

01:34.262 --> 01:36.464
- I think I'll be all right.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.332
- I will care for you.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.100
- I'll care for you.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.202
I don't need to be asked twice.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.703
- You weren't asked once.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.572
- I'll care for you.
- All right, it's settled.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.307
He's caring for you.
- Stop saying "care for me."

01:46.407 --> 01:48.108
- I will be upstairs with Emma,

01:48.209 --> 01:52.346
attending to her
every non-sexual need.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.215
- I was right, Maggie.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.217
Her cranium is exquisite.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.186
[Say Hi's "Back Before
We Were Brittle" playing]

01:58.286 --> 02:00.688
* Hey, remember when

02:00.788 --> 02:04.124
* All of time stood still

02:04.225 --> 02:08.496
* Ooh, do do do do

02:08.596 --> 02:12.266
* Back before we were brittle

02:12.366 --> 02:15.203
* Back before
we were brittle *

02:15.936 --> 02:17.538
- Oh, loving daughter.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.673
- This is a lot
of physical contact.

02:19.773 --> 02:23.244
- When you were a little girl,
you used to come into my room,

02:23.344 --> 02:24.645
crawl into the bed
in the middle of the night,

02:24.745 --> 02:26.747
and we'd cuddle until dawn.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.483
- Hmm, all I remember is
"ca-chink, ca-chink"

02:29.583 --> 02:31.419
'cause the door
was always locked.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.254
- Those were the nights
your father and I coupled.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.523
- Ugh, gross!
- All right, Gwen,

02:35.623 --> 02:38.192
thank you for your services
but the owls await.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.493
- Okay, get out of here, Mom.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.196
Go paint the owls.
What is all this?

02:42.296 --> 02:44.465
- * This is my satchel
of secrets *

02:44.565 --> 02:47.268
And this is fresh-baked
Grecian baklava.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.669
- Oh, no, no, no,
I don't want it.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.471
- Believe me,
you're gonna want this.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.805
- No, Mom, take it downstairs,
I don't wanna get

02:51.905 --> 02:53.641
filo dough between my sheets.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.510
- All right, fine,
but this is Emma's baklava.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.212
No one else
is allowed to eat it.

02:58.312 --> 03:01.682
- Fine, just one more touch.
- Okay.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.551
- Oh, mm.
- Okay, that's, like,

03:03.651 --> 03:06.687
three touches--get out of here!

03:06.787 --> 03:09.723
Okay, watch
"Bridget Jones's Diary."

03:11.392 --> 03:14.428
*

03:14.528 --> 03:16.297
- Initiate parental controls.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.301
- Sorry, that floppy-haired
scoundrel cannot help you,

03:20.401 --> 03:22.403
not tonight.
Lucky for you,

03:22.503 --> 03:25.473
I have become a bit of an expert
in ancient wisdom.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.775
- Ugh.
- And, as Socrates once said:

03:27.875 --> 03:31.379
"The wings of the griffin
bear the legs of a lion

03:31.479 --> 03:32.713
into the sky."

03:32.813 --> 03:34.748
- Let's find out.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.717
- Oh, God.

03:36.817 --> 03:42.356
*

03:42.456 --> 03:44.558
- Tina, you have
outdone yourself.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.427
Are those barn owl
cheese toasts?

03:46.527 --> 03:49.330
- With field mice olives.
- Come on.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.733
Is that real grass?
- It's wheat grass, actually.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.536
I wanted some healthy options
in case Emma decided

03:55.636 --> 03:57.705
to join us later.
- That is so sweet, Tina,

03:57.805 --> 03:59.573
but she definitely
won't be coming down here.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.476
- Oh, is she upstairs
crying about cancer?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.478
- Oh, no, she just
straight-up hates crafts.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.846
- Oh.
- Well, I spooned her

04:05.946 --> 04:07.481
about as much as I could.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.649
- Oh, I'll grab it.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.686
- Oh, that can't go there.
It's off-theme.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.622
- Don't get your feathers
in a bunch, Bird Bones.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.758
There.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.860
It's a nest.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.634
- Cookie, I wasn't sure
if you were gonna

04:26.734 --> 04:28.636
join us tonight.
- I wasn't sure either,

04:28.736 --> 04:31.339
but Bruce really wants us
to bury the hatchet.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.673
- Well, as I have
said repeatedly,

04:32.773 --> 04:34.908
I have no romantic designs
on Bruce, so.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.312
- Maggie, we're not gonna get
any place until you stop lying

04:38.412 --> 04:39.547
to yourself
and you just admit

04:39.647 --> 04:41.715
that you desperately
want my man.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.384
- All right.
- Okay.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.587
*

04:49.890 --> 04:53.427
- Very uncomfortable with
what's happening right now.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.663
- Don't be frightened.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.531
It's just the Socratic Stare.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.733
Is that a real thing?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.669
- We're making it real.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.705
I'm gonna gaze into your eyes,
and I'm gonna ask

05:04.805 --> 05:07.408
penetrating questions
of your soul.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.644
How do you feel?

05:10.744 --> 05:12.880
- I'm hating every second
of this.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.948
- Don't answer with your mouth.
Answer with your soul.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.817
- I wish I was watching
"Bridget Jones's Diary."

05:16.917 --> 05:18.686
- Ask your soul to get naked.

05:18.786 --> 05:19.853
- It says no.

05:19.953 --> 05:23.323
- Well, we don't know that

05:23.424 --> 05:25.459
because you won't
let her say anything.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.328
- Ow, what is this hard thing
poking my leg?

05:28.429 --> 05:31.432
- Oh, fantastic!
That's my pan flute.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.601
Ooh.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.869
- Okay, no.
- Mm, no, no, just...

05:35.969 --> 05:37.738
It just--I have to wet it.
- Yeah, we're done here.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.774
*

05:50.751 --> 05:51.785
Bunch of ladies
sitting side by side

05:51.885 --> 05:53.587
in silence painting owls?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.856
- She's here!
- Oh, daughter, come to Mama.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.658
- Ugh.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.461
- I just needed a break
from Zach's soul stares.

06:00.561 --> 06:04.364
Let's pack it up.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.734
I'll paint an owl.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.970
It'll be a hoot.
Hmm, nailed it.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.608
- It wasn't that funny.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.510
- Mary Pat's casino bus
broke down, so we have

06:16.610 --> 06:18.479
an extra set up...
- Great.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.380
- Just pop you right here.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.916
- All righty, let's get down
to painting some owls.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.895
- You look really good.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.665
You can hardly tell
that you have...

06:37.765 --> 06:39.399
The--The big C.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.835
- She's my daughter.
She's a fighter.

06:41.935 --> 06:45.506
- I sense a real strength
coming off of you.

06:45.606 --> 06:46.774
- All right,
we're gonna pack it up.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.776
No, no, you know, what we

06:48.876 --> 06:51.044
do need though is
to kick this ladies' night

06:51.144 --> 06:52.913
up a notch, all right?
Why aren't we eating

06:53.013 --> 06:54.648
any of this delicious food?
- Well, we eat it later,

06:54.748 --> 06:56.484
usually.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.851
Here, here, here, here,
I'm gonna insist everyone

06:57.951 --> 07:00.854
have a piece
of this delicious baklava.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.656
Come on, I have cancer.
You have to do what I say.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.024
- Everybody take a piece.
Let's go.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.959
- Get into this.
Yeah, there we go.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.595
Get into it, right?
- Mmm.

07:07.695 --> 07:08.729
- Mmm.
- Sorry.

07:08.829 --> 07:09.863
- Mmm.
- Mm, oh, wow.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.532
- Mm, that's got a real

07:11.632 --> 07:12.966
stanky-ness to it.
- Oh, no.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.703
What madness is this?
- Zach, I'm so sorry.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.005
I just couldn't take any more
of your pan flute poking me.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.707
- No, no, your baklava.

07:19.807 --> 07:20.874
Why is everyone eating
your baklava?

07:20.974 --> 07:22.710
That was Emma's baklava.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.678
- So you made me some baklava,
and I shared it

07:24.778 --> 07:26.614
with my friends.
- The baklava was made

07:26.714 --> 07:28.949
with a special recipe--
hand-cracked pistachios,

07:29.049 --> 07:32.553
honey from the comb, filo dough,
and medical-grade marijuana.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.854
- Oh, my God.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.656
- I got it from a supplier

07:35.756 --> 07:37.558
who supposedly used to sell
to Willie Nelson,

07:37.658 --> 07:39.459
but Willie Nelson won't shop
there anymore because

07:39.560 --> 07:40.828
he says the weed is too strong,
and it wigs him out.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.630
- Zach, what are you saying
to us right now?

07:42.730 --> 07:44.732
- Strap in, because
you are about to,

07:44.832 --> 07:46.800
as they say in the old country,
trip balls.

07:48.902 --> 07:49.169
.

07:49.236 --> 07:52.139
- I cannot believe you
did this, Zach!

07:53.373 --> 07:53.406
- The important thing here
is that we remain calm.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.509
- I can't believe
I ate marijuana.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.110
Does that make me a drug mule?

07:58.111 --> 07:59.713
- Now, Zach, is this gonna be
more of a sativa

07:59.813 --> 08:01.582
or an indica high?
- Mom, what do you know

08:01.682 --> 08:03.584
about pot?
- Oh, come on.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.019
Who among us hasn't gotten
high on their own supply?

08:06.119 --> 08:08.255
- Gwen, you know that means
you sold drugs, right?

08:08.355 --> 08:10.023
- I was following
Jefferson Airplane

08:10.123 --> 08:11.659
around the country,
and that white rabbit?

08:11.759 --> 08:15.663
He don't let nobody
ride for free.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.665
All right, all right, all right.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.867
- Well, there it is--
a bad McConaughey.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.269
The journey's begun.
All right, screw this.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.137
- Hey, hey, hey, Zach,
not you too!

08:24.237 --> 08:25.673
- No, Zach, no!
- Whoa!

08:25.773 --> 08:26.840
- I refuse to be
the only one not high

08:26.940 --> 08:28.709
at a ladies' craft night.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.277
Yeah, come on everybody,

08:30.377 --> 08:33.080
hop on my big wheel.
Vroom.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.149
Because I don't see it.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.052
- Shall we throw on an album
and let the music be our guide?

08:39.152 --> 08:41.622
- Um, I have a better idea.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.191
*

08:44.291 --> 08:48.161
The cosmos, it beckons us:
Follow.

08:48.261 --> 08:51.632
For the word "planets"
comes from the Greek "planetai"

08:51.732 --> 08:54.201
meaning "wanderer."

08:54.301 --> 08:57.204
- The original name
for the Milky Way

08:57.304 --> 08:59.607
was the Fudge Gap.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.676
- I don't think that's right.
- Uh-huh, the stanky Fudge Gap.

09:05.012 --> 09:08.115
- But seriously, guys,
this owl-shaped fudge

09:08.215 --> 09:11.184
is the best thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.654
Who made it?

09:13.754 --> 09:18.225
- The year was 1941.

09:18.325 --> 09:22.195
The Nazis had just
invaded Russia.

09:22.295 --> 09:26.667
My grandmother,
Illyana Federovna,

09:26.767 --> 09:28.902
had to flee.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.642
- She only took with her
two possessions:

09:34.742 --> 09:39.747
the recipe for this fudge,
and a batch that she had sewn

09:39.847 --> 09:42.315
into the lining
of her tattered shawl.

09:42.415 --> 09:47.821
This pocket fudge is what
kept her alive

09:47.921 --> 09:52.225
on her tumultuous journey
to America.

09:52.325 --> 09:53.694
- God bless America.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.263
- That's an incredible story.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.234
I'm just messing with you guys.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.670
all: What?

10:02.770 --> 10:04.271
- Oh.
- I heard that story

10:04.371 --> 10:06.606
on Rachel Zoe's
"Who Do You Think You Are?"

10:07.775 --> 10:09.242
- No, no!

10:09.342 --> 10:13.346
- Well, I have a story
that is 100% true.

10:13.446 --> 10:18.285
I once rode a dragon
into the golden sun.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.721
- What are you
talking about, Mom?

10:22.723 --> 10:26.293
- Emma, she be with dragons now.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.928
She be with dragons.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.697
- I'm starving.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.765
Do you have anything
in your refrigerator

10:31.865 --> 10:33.734
that is not shaped like an owl?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.903
- Uh, just a bunch of canceroles
that people brought, wait--

10:36.003 --> 10:37.370
both: Canceroles!

10:39.940 --> 10:41.241
- Oh, I'm zapping a plate.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.276
- All right, I'm coming with.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.979
- I would join you, but my legs
have turned into wings.

10:47.748 --> 10:51.752
Canceroles.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.888
*

10:54.988 --> 10:58.358
- Mm, God, who would have known
cold casseroles

10:58.458 --> 11:00.193
could taste so good?

11:00.293 --> 11:01.895
- Uh-huh, if you've got
some bread, I'm gonna make us

11:01.995 --> 11:02.996
a casserole sandwich.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.297
- Go.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.899
- That sounds amazing.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.801
Here you go.
- Yeah.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.737
- I cannot tell you--
this is like the first time

11:09.837 --> 11:12.205
that food has tasted good
to me in months.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.673
- When I had chemo,
the only thing I could eat

11:13.774 --> 11:14.875
was pudding and baby crackers.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.910
You had cancer?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.312
- Oh, yeah, triple negative,
left breast.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.781
- No.
- I'll be seven years out

11:20.881 --> 11:21.915
this March.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.285
- I don't really like
to lead with that.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.821
I think of it as just
one very short chapter

11:27.921 --> 11:30.858
in a very long book
that I like to call

11:30.958 --> 11:32.826
"Cookie: I Ain't Gonna Crumble."

11:32.926 --> 11:35.695
- That is exactly what I was
just telling Maggie.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.464
You know, this doesn't
have to change my whole life.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.700
- Mm, yeah, no, that's not
really what I'm saying

11:40.801 --> 11:43.436
'cause you have cancer, right,
or you had cancer,

11:43.536 --> 11:45.238
everything's changed.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.709
I--I need a pickle.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.244
- I need a pickle.
- Okay.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.445
- This needs a pickle,
right now.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.281
- Okay, okay, I'm gonna get it.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.785
- Never ridden a dragon
bare-back before.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.487
*

12:02.956 --> 12:05.492
- Tell me where you want
your color, friend.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.094
Clever.
- What is your

12:07.194 --> 12:08.428
favorite dinosaur?

12:08.528 --> 12:10.964
Stegosaurus.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.800
I don't know why that's funny.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.735
- Now tell me,
is Bird Bones your given name?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.871
- No.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.740
- My real name
is Tina Steigerman.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.276
- Wow, that's pretty.
- Oh, well, thank you.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.946
Emma gave me the nickname
Bird Bones in high school

12:26.046 --> 12:30.050
because I kept breaking
all my tiny bones.

12:30.150 --> 12:33.386
- Oh, well, Emma's
given me quite a few

12:33.486 --> 12:34.988
hurtful nicknames
over the years.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.757
- Yeah, um, Ichabod Crane,

12:37.858 --> 12:40.093
"The Nightmare Before Christmas"
starring Zach Skeleton.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.395
- Mm-hmm.
- Slenderman, Son of Slenderman.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.397
- Oh, and then of course

12:44.497 --> 12:47.367
The Pale Jack Sparrow.
- Oh, I always liked

12:47.467 --> 12:51.538
Jack Sparrow...
except he was too tan.

12:54.942 --> 13:00.080
- Um, Tina, would--
would you mind if I took a peek

13:00.180 --> 13:02.549
into your soul
using the Socratic Stare?

13:02.649 --> 13:06.053
- Um, sure.
- Okay.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.533
How do you feel?

13:20.633 --> 13:22.035
- I feel...

13:22.135 --> 13:24.905
- You don't have to answer
with your words.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.107
Answer with your soul.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.044
Mm.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.114
*

13:34.214 --> 13:35.515
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.184
You got a real heft
to them, huh?

13:37.284 --> 13:38.852
- Yeah, yeah,
that's what I like about them.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.587
Listen, you're not so
shabby yourself.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.589
- Oh, well, thank you.
- Yeah, and think about this--

13:42.689 --> 13:45.025
when we're 80, we're gonna have
the perkiest tits around, right?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.060
- Yeah, I guess
that's something.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.496
- Hey, you're not
gonna believe this,

13:49.596 --> 13:51.932
but I promise you that one day,
when you get through

13:52.032 --> 13:54.902
all of this, you're gonna be
happier than you were before.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.070
- Okay, well, now you just
sound like a Hallmark original

13:57.170 --> 13:59.106
starring Jennifer Beals.
- I would not mess with

13:59.206 --> 14:01.074
the Beals if I were you
'cause she's a maniac.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.145
- And look, okay,
cancer is the toughest thing

14:05.245 --> 14:08.081
I've ever been through,
absolutely,

14:08.181 --> 14:11.084
but it was my wake up call,
and now I'm just--

14:11.184 --> 14:13.186
I'm living a "hell yes" life.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.125
- That means that you've been
through the fire.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.027
You know the secret.

14:20.127 --> 14:23.530
We're not here forever,
so you gotta say yes to life

14:23.630 --> 14:26.900
and stop being scared to do
the things you care about.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.235
Here.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.470
- Wait, no, Cookie,
I can't take that.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.105
- Take it.
It's okay.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.440
I got it tattooed, like,
four different places

14:33.540 --> 14:34.874
on my body.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.643
- "Hell yes life."

14:36.743 --> 14:38.045
Thank you.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.879
- Hey, you're a badass.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.514
You're gonna get through this.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.516
- You know, a couple months ago
in self-defense class,

14:43.616 --> 14:47.120
you told me I was the weakest
human being you'd ever met.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.556
- I was wrong.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.224
- Guys, this owl is real.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.261
I painted this owl into reality.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.663
- Emergency!
I just kissed Zach!

14:56.763 --> 14:58.531
- It's true.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.068
No one look into my eyes--
they will mesmerize you,

15:01.168 --> 15:04.237
and the next thing you know,
sexual kissing.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.673
What did I just say?

15:10.343 --> 15:10.477
.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.216
- Okay, so I got an update on
the Bird Bones/Zach situation.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.551
It appears that it was
just a one-time thing.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.287
- Mm.
- Although, I think they're

15:20.387 --> 15:21.521
kind of cute together, right?
- Yeah.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.323
Hey, where's your owl?

15:23.423 --> 15:26.193
- Yeah, I released him
back into the wild.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.528
It was hard, but, well,
you gotta do

15:28.628 --> 15:29.529
some hard things sometimes.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.567
- Oh, Cookie gave it to me.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.503
- Yeah.
Did you know

15:36.603 --> 15:38.705
she had breast cancer?
- Oh, yeah, Bruce mentioned it.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.108
- No idea.

15:41.208 --> 15:44.277
- Yeah, that's her motto,

15:44.377 --> 15:46.113
but I won't be wearing it
any time soon.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.447
- I don't know.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.449
I guess Cookie's
a better person than me

15:49.549 --> 15:52.652
'cause all I feel is just,
like, real pissed

15:52.752 --> 15:55.622
and angry that
this happened to me.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.125
I mean, I'm not even 40,
and I have to face

15:58.225 --> 16:00.393
my own mortality?

16:00.493 --> 16:02.629
Not interested.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.365
- You know you're kind of
already doing this, right?

16:05.465 --> 16:07.200
Saying yes.
- No, I'm not.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.337
- Well, you didn't do it
just now, but, yes, you are.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.205
You came down those stairs
for craft night.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.607
Emma from a year ago
would've never done that.

16:14.707 --> 16:18.211
You said yes to staring deeply
into Zach's soul.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.248
- Oh, I did say hell yes
to touching Cookie's boobs.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.549
- Actually it was

16:22.649 --> 16:24.351
a mutual squeeze.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.219
- Oh, it was a dream come true.
- I bet.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.288
- Mm, like little
clouds of Heaven.

16:30.623 --> 16:33.226
You know you're not the only one
who's changing, right?

16:33.326 --> 16:35.528
I mean, I invited Cookie
into my home willingly,

16:35.628 --> 16:36.763
and she got them crazy eyes.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.465
- That's true.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.400
- Zach and Bird Bones
sucking face.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.169
Can't get enough of each other.
- My mother can't stop

16:42.269 --> 16:43.670
touching me.
- Well, she loves you.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.339
- Oh, gross.
- God, I cannot believe

16:46.439 --> 16:48.641
that we keep learning
life lessons from a woman

16:48.741 --> 16:50.743
named Cookie.
- I know.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.612
That's why it's so messed up
that you keep trying

16:52.712 --> 16:55.282
to get her man.
- I just want him so hard.

16:56.749 --> 17:03.723
*

17:13.566 --> 17:17.204
- There's my little girl.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.306
Is everything okay?
Do you need anything?

17:19.406 --> 17:21.441
- No, Mom, I'm okay.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.675
- Mm.

17:22.775 --> 17:29.749
*

17:35.455 --> 17:37.390
- I left you a full tray
of that fudge

17:37.490 --> 17:39.226
that we were snacking on
last night.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.228
- Honestly, Teens, next time
I'm throwing a party,

17:41.328 --> 17:42.729
I'm calling you.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.731
- Oh, I just mean--
- I would love that.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.366
I mean, well, of course,
we would have to think

17:46.466 --> 17:48.535
of title first.
I mean, would I be

17:48.635 --> 17:52.739
"Director of Catering" or,
ooh, "Master of Food Services"?

17:52.839 --> 17:55.242
Ooh, and what would the font
on our business card be?

17:55.342 --> 17:57.477
Oh, there is so much
to think about.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.712
But who am I kidding?
I accept!

18:02.849 --> 18:05.485
- Hell yes, Teens.
Let's do this.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.719
- I am so excited.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.688
I'm gonna go find Zach.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.660
- I think you're in business
with Bird Bones, honey.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.595
- Oh.
- Well, ladies, that is a night

18:15.695 --> 18:19.466
I won't soon forget...
once I remember what happened.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.769
Maggie.
- Yeah, Gwen, thanks for coming.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.737
- Daughter.
- Oh.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.708
- You just gonna
let this happen?

18:28.808 --> 18:31.278
- I am, Mom, I am.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.781
- Oh.
- Okay, don't push it.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.783
- Hey, Gwen, there was one thing
you mentioned last night

18:36.883 --> 18:39.786
that we wanted to ask you about.
- Oh, no, did that Grecian grass

18:39.886 --> 18:42.422
get the best of me?
Why, what did I say?

18:42.522 --> 18:46.893
- You said that you once rode
the dragon into the golden sun?

18:46.993 --> 18:49.329
- No, I never said that.
- No, Mom, it was you.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.399
We heard you say it.
- I agree to disagree.

18:52.499 --> 18:53.666
- Okay, Gwen,
you have to tell us.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.568
What did it mean
- Good-bye.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.304
- Mom, okay, I'll walk you out.
- I'm not gonna

18:57.404 --> 18:58.738
tell you anything.
- Mom, just tell me

18:58.838 --> 19:00.440
what you said!
- Ugh.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.708
- Come on.
- There's nothing to tell.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.810
- Ay-yai-yai.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.313
- Maggie, thanks for
the hospitality.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.348
- I'm glad that you came.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.749
- Yeah, it kind of turned out
to be an unexpected adventure.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.852
- Yeah, it did.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.654
Bury the hatchet?

19:14.754 --> 19:17.390
- Did you have that
in your purse the whole time?

19:17.490 --> 19:18.758
And that is literally a hatchet.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.693
- Got a spot for it
in your backyard?

19:20.793 --> 19:23.863
- Uh, yeah, I think we could
find something under a tree.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.633
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.668
Sorry, do you want to just
walk ahead of me?

19:28.768 --> 19:30.470
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.473
- I am really sorry that
I kissed you last night.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.442
I see now why they call it
a gateway drug.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.577
- I'm really sorry
I kissed you back.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.513
You know, I'm a bit
of an amateur when it comes

19:40.613 --> 19:42.849
to the Socratic Stare,
and I was mussing with powers

19:42.949 --> 19:44.517
far beyond my control.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.718
- It will not
happen again.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.455
- No, no, not on my watch.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.193
- Mm.
- Mm.

19:54.294 --> 19:57.697
- I--I am gonna be
so careful with your bones.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.732
- That means so much to me.

20:03.870 --> 20:04.203
.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.973
- Now I am interested
in your new approach, Emma,

20:08.140 --> 20:08.975
because I live what I call
a "balls out life."

20:09.942 --> 20:11.911
- Well, I'm definitely not
interested in that.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.513
I think I'm just gonna,
I don't know,

20:13.613 --> 20:15.382
try to say yes to more things.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.517
- If I asked you to go
erotic kite flying with me?

20:17.617 --> 20:19.352
- Ew, Zach!

20:19.452 --> 20:21.220
Just a bunch of naked people
flying kites?

20:21.321 --> 20:22.622
- No, that'd be disgusting.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.357
No, the people
are fully clothed.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.892
It's the kites that are erotic.

20:30.096 --> 20:31.431
- Hmm.

20:31.531 --> 20:35.368
- Oh, my God, Emma.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.903
- It's a Jefferson
Airplane album.

20:38.371 --> 20:41.941
*

20:42.041 --> 20:44.977
Oh, my God, is that my mother?

20:45.077 --> 20:47.980
Riding a dragon?
- Into the golden sun, yes.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.982
- Wait, I just got an idea
for an erotic kite.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.951
- If I see you flying my mom

20:52.051 --> 20:54.253
in a public park,
I'm gonna be so pissed.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.323
- Meh, it's no biggie.
I'm gonna fly your mom.
