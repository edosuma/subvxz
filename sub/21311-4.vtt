23:11.491 --> 23:12.892
Smith caught one
on the shoulder.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.795
Get him out of there.
Come on, get him out of there.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.730
- I'm not crazy.

23:17.764 --> 23:20.600
I saw it with my own eyes.
That's my proof.

23:20.633 --> 23:22.735
- Really? You really think
that's gonna fly

23:22.769 --> 23:23.936
in an after-action?

23:23.970 --> 23:25.638
While you were under heavy fire,

23:25.672 --> 23:27.474
you were able to discern
that the UN doc

23:27.507 --> 23:29.008
was purposely trying
to kill that lady?

23:29.041 --> 23:31.878
- Captain, with all due respect,
you don't treat a gunshot wound

23:31.911 --> 23:34.013
by putting your hand inside
and then pulling it open.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.715
- I'm not questioning
your logic;

23:35.748 --> 23:38.518
I'm questioning your accuracy.
- Guys, hold up,

23:38.551 --> 23:39.886
what--what's going on?
- I saw what I saw,

23:39.919 --> 23:41.621
and that's exactly
how I'm gonna write it up.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.456
- Great, I look forward to
redacting it.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.892
Dismissed.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.594
- [sighs]

23:48.895 --> 23:51.798
- What the hell went on?

23:51.831 --> 23:53.533
- I have no clue.

24:11.651 --> 24:15.254
[dark ambient music]

24:15.287 --> 24:17.757
It's the green and white one.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.959
No car, no trash.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.928
It's probably bugged out.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.262
- Or he knows we're coming.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.831
*

24:25.865 --> 24:29.602
- No, no one's trying
to pull a fast one here.

24:29.636 --> 24:32.505
Sure, absolutely.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.574
It's called
expediting things, though,

24:34.607 --> 24:37.644
and, you know,
there's a fee for that.

24:37.677 --> 24:41.013
No, no, no, no, that's--
that's just called business.

24:41.047 --> 24:44.016
Yeah.
[laughs]

24:44.050 --> 24:46.753
Hey, let me call you back.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.523
I'm Toby Sloane.
And you are?

24:50.557 --> 24:51.824
- Agent Memphis.

24:51.858 --> 24:54.093
I'm investigating
someone named Waheed Sakir,

24:54.126 --> 24:57.564
in connection with last week's
terror attack in Frankfurt.

24:57.597 --> 25:00.567
- I see.
Uh, how can I help you?

25:00.600 --> 25:01.968
- Well, he was moved from
Afghanistan to Frankfurt

25:02.001 --> 25:03.703
about two months ago.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.606
By this company...

25:06.639 --> 25:08.541
I was hoping to look at
his file.

25:08.575 --> 25:09.942
- His file?
- Yeah.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.078
I'm just trying to understand
how someone like Waheed,

25:12.111 --> 25:14.747
who had no skills
or training of any kind,

25:14.781 --> 25:16.949
got help from a place like this.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.719
- You must be aware that
for that kinda thing,

25:19.752 --> 25:22.555
you'll need a warrant.

25:22.589 --> 25:25.324
- Can I ask what exactly
do you do here?

25:25.357 --> 25:26.793
- Gravity Metals
is a multi-commodity

25:26.826 --> 25:28.327
mining and exploration company

25:28.360 --> 25:30.329
with a focus on
rare earth minerals.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.765
- Which ones?
- Excuse me?

25:32.799 --> 25:36.569
- Which rare earth minerals
do you focus on?

25:36.603 --> 25:39.572
- [chuckles]
- What's your title, Toby?

25:39.606 --> 25:40.873
- Okay, Miss--
- It's Agent.

25:40.907 --> 25:43.610
- Agent Memphis,
I'm really pretty busy here,

25:43.643 --> 25:45.144
so if you require
any further assistance,

25:45.177 --> 25:48.080
I suggest you get a warrant.

25:48.114 --> 25:51.751
- Okay, well,
thanks for your time.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.052
- Mm-hm.

- Thanks, Mrs. Swagger.

26:45.838 --> 26:47.073
I'll see you next week.
- Sounds good.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.041
Thanks, Gary.
- All right.

26:49.075 --> 26:52.178
*

26:52.211 --> 26:54.013
- All right.

26:54.046 --> 26:57.684
I see two avenues
have approached from the north.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.721
- There's been no movement
in over an hour.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.723
How long you wanna
wait this out?

27:03.756 --> 27:06.425
- Until we get eyes on him.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.994
- We dropped fire
on this asshole,

27:08.027 --> 27:09.729
he didn't even move.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.430
This could take weeks.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.865
We may not ever have
eyes on him.

27:12.899 --> 27:14.701
- We're a couple hundred
yards away

27:14.734 --> 27:16.235
from arguably the best shot
in the world.

27:16.268 --> 27:19.071
I'm not going in blind because
you have a patience problem.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.140
- [chuckles]
Yeah, I get it.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.109
- You get what?

27:23.142 --> 27:26.012
- You're calling the shots now.
It must feel pretty good.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.114
- I'm not calling shit.

27:28.147 --> 27:31.884
[sighs] Listen, man,
I'm sorry you lost your wife.

27:32.752 --> 27:35.822
I'm just trying to keep the same
thing from happening to me.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.158

we shouldn't have.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.760
They shut it down.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.061

who your source was.

he might be onto something?

went through the crack of a door

carotid artery?

this is like Plutonium.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.245
*

35:13.279 --> 35:15.247
I write this report,

35:15.281 --> 35:17.449
I'm basically accusing the UN

35:17.483 --> 35:21.553
of taking out a witness
to a CIA-run heroin ring.

But it's just a report, man.

It's an account of
what happened out there today;

35:31.497 --> 35:32.798
the facts.

35:32.831 --> 35:36.202
Nobody's asking you
to make any accusations.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.936
How they choose to interpret it

35:37.969 --> 35:40.206
is their business.

it's that easy, huh?

35:43.975 --> 35:46.245

Bob Lee Swagger for a day.

were caught up

You all have been in my prayers.

but it's behind us.

36:29.288 --> 36:32.958
In my experience, I find
violence is hard to shake.

36:34.460 --> 36:35.961
I also find that, uh,

36:35.994 --> 36:39.465
talking can be more helpful
than lighting candles.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.199
Hm?

36:44.603 --> 36:46.872
- [sighs] I just--

36:46.905 --> 36:49.408
I feel on edge all the time.

36:49.441 --> 36:52.978
I mean, even when I do things
that I--I love,

36:53.011 --> 36:57.316
I just always feel like
something awful is gonna happen.

36:58.517 --> 37:01.320
Of course,
nothing gets to Bob Lee.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.988
- Okay, first,

37:03.021 --> 37:05.391
what you are going through is--

37:05.424 --> 37:08.427
is normal,
is healthy even.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.330
And Bob Lee isn't Superman.

37:11.363 --> 37:13.299
- Yeah.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.434
You're right.
He's just...

37:15.467 --> 37:18.870
really good at hiding
all of his emotions.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.807
- Well, he's not unique in that.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.411
I've known plenty
who have mastered that skill.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.245
[exhales calmly]

37:29.548 --> 37:33.385
Bob Lee has a road to walk.

37:35.387 --> 37:37.022
And so do you.

37:37.055 --> 37:40.992
Sometimes, you travel together;
sometimes, apart.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.829
The important thing

37:43.862 --> 37:46.965
is that you end up
in the same place.

37:51.603 --> 37:55.374
- [groaning]

37:55.407 --> 37:57.909
You shot me.
- In your chest plate.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.611
You're lucky that's all I did.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.313
- I had him.
- Like hell you had him.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.949
How many fingers I got up, huh?
- [groans]

38:03.982 --> 38:05.651
- That's what I thought.
You pull that shit again,

38:05.684 --> 38:07.519
I'll kill you
in half a heartbeat.

38:07.553 --> 38:08.920
- Always gotta be the hero, huh?

38:08.954 --> 38:10.489
- I'm not trying to be
anybody's hero.

38:10.522 --> 38:11.657
You did this.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.492
You're completely
out of control.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.660
- [groans]

38:14.693 --> 38:17.663
[ominous music]

38:17.696 --> 38:24.970
*

38:34.446 --> 38:36.948
- Change of plans.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.984
I'll be staying a little longer.

38:39.017 --> 38:46.358
*

39:13.018 --> 39:14.886
- Just like old times.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.127
- I met with Denning,
that reporter I told you about.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.729
- Yep.

39:23.762 --> 39:26.432
- He's scared,
and rightfully so.

39:26.465 --> 39:29.568
Took some work, but I managed
to get a name from him.

39:29.601 --> 39:32.438
His source was Kurt Zehnder.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.473
- Zehnder?
- I loved the guy,

39:34.506 --> 39:35.674
but they say he hasn't been
doing too well

39:35.707 --> 39:37.543
the last few years.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.478
- Yeah, Denning said he might've
had some mental health issues,

39:39.511 --> 39:42.514
but apparently everything
he brought him checked out.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.149
All that was left
was the transfer of a file

39:44.182 --> 39:46.017
he swore would
corroborate everything.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.619
- What happened?

39:47.653 --> 39:49.187
- Zehnder used a courier
to get the file to Denning,

39:49.220 --> 39:51.490
but the courier never showed.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.625
A week later,
Zehnder committed suicide,

39:53.659 --> 39:55.594
and that's when Denning
went underground.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.596
- What the hell did Zehnder have
in that file?

39:57.629 --> 40:00.098
- I don't know yet,
but I did some digging

40:00.131 --> 40:01.967
and he's got a storage facility
under a false name.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.635
We're gonna go check it out.

40:03.669 --> 40:05.471
But there's something else.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.506
When I got back from Frankfurt,
I had the Bureau's artist

40:07.539 --> 40:10.709
render an image of the guy
from the hotel room.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.177
He was posing as
a German police officer.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.446
I found him in Bob Lee's room.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.582
Does this face
mean anything to you?

40:16.615 --> 40:20.619
[tense music]

40:20.652 --> 40:23.054
- Looks like the UN doctor
from Afghanistan.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.123
- And it looks like
the guy who did this to me.

40:25.156 --> 40:28.727
- [yells]
- Solotov...

40:28.760 --> 40:32.063
Shit, Donny was right.

40:32.097 --> 40:33.999
Solotov killed
the mullah's wife,

40:34.032 --> 40:35.100
'cause she knew about
the heroin.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.503
Now he's coming after us.

40:37.536 --> 40:38.770
- But why now?

40:38.804 --> 40:40.672
We found that stuff
six years ago.

40:40.706 --> 40:43.241
- It's possible someone got wind
of Denning's story.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.478
Meachum was skimming off the top
to run rogue black ops.

40:46.512 --> 40:49.548
No telling how many hands
were in that pot.

40:49.581 --> 40:51.182
- I met a guy in prison
last year,

40:51.216 --> 40:54.586
Alexi Prosovich,
he's Russian Mafia, dialed in.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.187
Maybe he knows something.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.123
- Let's pay him a visit.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.157
- Okay, well, the thing
we have to figure out

40:59.190 --> 41:00.559
is who hired Solotov.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.127
- How do we know
it wasn't Gregson?

41:02.160 --> 41:03.495
She'd been trying
to clean up

41:03.529 --> 41:05.163
that Meachum fallout for years.

41:05.196 --> 41:08.033
- Patricia's whole MO is
border and containment.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.768
You should know.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.236
If she wanted to silence
the 8113,

41:11.269 --> 41:13.104
there are much quieter ways
of doing it.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.607
Someone else
is pulling the strings.

41:15.641 --> 41:19.044
- We find Solotov,
we find the answers.

41:19.077 --> 41:22.548
Let's just hope
he doesn't find us first.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.215
*
