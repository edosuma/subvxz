WEBVTT

00:15.056 --> 00:16.266
I can't--

00:16.766 --> 00:18.309
I can't reach it.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.325
It stopped.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.578
Where are we?

00:37.537 --> 00:38.747
I don't really know.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.040
EPISODE 3: LUNATIC SEVEN

00:40.123 --> 00:42.834
I didn't know
that this tube was here either.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.669
We have air.

00:45.253 --> 00:48.339
This is probably a pathway
for maintenance drones.

00:48.423 --> 00:51.509
It connects to someplace with oxygen.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.720
What if we can't get out of here?

00:54.637 --> 00:56.848
Nobody is dying today.

00:56.931 --> 00:58.516
Ouch!

00:58.600 --> 01:00.560
How do you know that?

01:00.643 --> 01:02.771
Because that's what's written
in the <i>Seven Poem</i>.

01:02.854 --> 01:03.855
PROPHECIES

01:03.938 --> 01:05.857
Please leave out the occult.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.277
In situations like these, you just do
what you need to do based on science.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.488
I'll do what I need to do.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.617
Mina, everybody!

01:16.201 --> 01:20.622
So we've escaped
to some kind of unknown tube.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.249
And who saved us?

01:23.333 --> 01:25.126
Why, this stuffed animal did.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.338
Who are you?

01:28.421 --> 01:31.508
I am Anshin-kun, the station fairy.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.051
Right.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.345
But who's inside?

01:35.428 --> 01:37.514
There isn't anybody inside.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.184
-Who's that?
-It's the chief.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.895
Oh, the chief. I see now.

01:43.978 --> 01:46.189
I don't get it! Chief of what?

01:46.272 --> 01:48.983
Come on now. Pop out, why don't you?

02:00.703 --> 02:02.789
What? Just an old guy?

02:02.872 --> 02:04.749
He's not just an old guy.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.253
He's the chief designer of this station--
Kokubunji.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.255
The ex-designer.

02:10.338 --> 02:13.800
When Deegle acquired it,
they kindly fired me.

02:13.883 --> 02:17.512
Then does that mean
you know all about this station?

02:17.595 --> 02:20.140
-Do you know where we should run away to?
-Yeah.

02:20.223 --> 02:24.561
-Really?
-I designed it up to a point after all.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.980
But this is different
from what I remember.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.023
Did you say "up to a point"?

02:29.107 --> 02:30.900
Up to what point?

02:30.984 --> 02:32.485
About 70%.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.238
So you're not familiar with the other 30%?

02:37.615 --> 02:40.410
There's oxygen
on the other side of this hatch.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.917
Push me.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.502
Everybody push.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.718
All right. We're safe.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.972
That's lucky.
The spare battery is still alive.

03:01.055 --> 03:03.474
But it probably won't last for long.

03:03.558 --> 03:07.437
This is a shop for tourists
to arrange an EVA.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.855
What is an EVA?

03:08.938 --> 03:12.191
It's spacewalking.
You put on a space suit and go outside.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.277
Nasa, are you okay?

03:15.695 --> 03:17.655
This is the Apollo space suit.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.742
-What's this?
-Don't touch that!

03:21.659 --> 03:24.287
There is no air
on the other side of this bulkhead.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.997
There's a breach beyond this point.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.041
Open it and it's curtains for you.

03:28.124 --> 03:31.252
Then it's a dead end.
Where do we get on the shuttle?

03:31.336 --> 03:32.962
It's the ring pathway.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.716
If we walk all the way to the Mars dome,
then we should be able to get to the top.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.595
-What?
-The ring pathway isn't connected.

03:40.678 --> 03:44.349
That's right.
It hasn't been constructed yet.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.309
The other side hasn't yet either.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.019
Air is leaking out too.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.689
Soon, humans won't be able
to occupy this spot either.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.692
Will we die? Are we going to die?

03:55.443 --> 03:57.237
We are not dying yet.

03:57.737 --> 04:00.198
The next cylinder over still has power.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.991
Our only option is to go there.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.494
But there's no pathway.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.246
There's a way.

04:07.622 --> 04:11.334
We're gonna go outside
and walk on the drone catwalk.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.296
Outside? As in out in space?

04:15.964 --> 04:17.006
Obviously.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.801
Yes. We get to do an EVA.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.052
No way.

04:21.135 --> 04:24.222
Isn't that something
only people with training can do?

04:24.305 --> 04:25.890
-Yeah.
-Yep.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.642
I can't do that.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.227
Don't worry.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.438
I have loads of EVA experience.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.816
You'll be fine if you follow me.

04:34.899 --> 04:39.404
Look, I'm even in my personalized
space suit already.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.242
This is an Orlan.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.953
-What's that?
-An antique space suit.

04:47.036 --> 04:48.454
Fine. Just close it!

04:49.247 --> 04:52.625
I made it to meet demand for the mascot
off the station,

04:52.709 --> 04:55.378
but I never got any offers.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.714
Now the time to use it has--

05:00.174 --> 05:01.426
Chief?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.345
Who the hell are you people?

05:06.222 --> 05:08.016
Calm down, Chief.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.226
Sit down over here.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.103
Not again.

05:12.186 --> 05:14.230
What was that?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.190
Idiopathic dementia.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.694
It occasionally flares up.
He recovers right away though.

05:19.777 --> 05:22.447
Chief, could you tell me your name?

05:22.530 --> 05:24.699
I'm Anshin-kun.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.120
I'll go get the space suits.

05:29.871 --> 05:33.624
No way. I can't do it.
I've never spacewalked before.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.753
Find something
that is within our capabilities!

05:36.836 --> 05:38.880
Then stay here and die.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.049
-What?
-Touya.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.843
Space is true nature.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.846
True nature is not your friend.

05:46.929 --> 05:47.930
SPACE IS OUR FRIEND!

05:48.014 --> 05:50.725
It will kill humans caught off guard.
It's your enemy.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.478
What is that supposed to mean?

05:54.479 --> 05:57.732
The people who have no will to live
will get left behind.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.569
I'm am so going to broadcast you
when this is over.

06:01.652 --> 06:04.822
I'm sorry. He doesn't mean it.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.493
But Touya is right.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.787
You can complain all you want,
but you'll only die.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.748
What? Are you taking his side?

06:13.831 --> 06:16.959
That and I've wanted to try an EVA.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.003
I'm going to go help Touya.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.798
What? Stupid brother.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.219
I can't get on the shuttle
unless I can get to the dome.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.807
This has holes in it.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.809
This is also under maintenance.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.268
This is bad.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.854
There aren't any usable space suits.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.107
I'll help too.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.317
I've studied the equipment.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.778
-Yeah, help us out.
-Okay.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.988
By the way,

06:46.072 --> 06:48.950
I really respect you, Touya.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.079
There will be more people like you
in the future,

06:53.162 --> 06:55.832
and you will represent humanity.

06:56.457 --> 06:59.669
Also, Seven said the same thing.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.713
Humanity must leave Earth.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.092
Yes, I know.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.971
I'm sorry
for flicking your forehead before.

07:10.054 --> 07:13.099
No way. I'm honored. Please do it again.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.309
I don't think so.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.103
Sup?

07:17.812 --> 07:22.108
I plan on surviving too, so I'll help.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.281
-Konoha.
-Yes, Mina?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.408
Sorry about before.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.994
I was out of line with that question.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.412
Don't worry about it.

07:35.663 --> 07:39.709
Okay. I'm going survive no matter what
and beat his follower count.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.296
-Touya.
-What?

07:43.796 --> 07:47.758
I want you to lead us
when we do the EVA over there.

07:47.842 --> 07:48.759
What?

07:48.843 --> 07:52.597
Nasa is injured, and I'm worried
about the chief's dementia.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.391
You do it.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.603
You're really like a leader.
You're arrogant and all.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.481
I don't have experience in space.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.608
Touya,
you're the most suited for this.

08:04.233 --> 08:06.944
We don't really need a leader, do we?

08:07.028 --> 08:09.322
There's no up or down in space.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.532
Yes, we do need one.

08:12.366 --> 08:17.079
I'm just saying
I'm not very good at reading the room.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.289
We know.

08:18.372 --> 08:21.083
There are no rooms in space,
so you'll be fine.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.087
Don't blame me if we fail.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.006
Then it's settled.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.009
Search for space suit parts.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.136
There's one suit here.

08:32.220 --> 08:35.598
That's a mock-up. If you wear it outside,
you will die instantly.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.933
A wheelchair.

08:37.642 --> 08:38.935
What's this?

08:41.687 --> 08:44.357
This is an air lock.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.027
Found them. Space suits.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.781
We have one children's bubble,

08:51.864 --> 08:55.034
the two atmospheric pressure suits
that Taiyou found

08:55.117 --> 08:57.245
and an online suit that is off-line.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.790
Chief has the Orlan, so we are short two.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.209
Are the ONIQLOs we're wearing now no good?

09:03.292 --> 09:06.128
This is like a casual life jacket.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.756
You won't even last five minutes out there
in one of these.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.800
What do you mean "won't last"?

09:10.883 --> 09:13.636
-You will burst.
-Burst?

09:18.224 --> 09:21.894
At this atmospheric pressure,
the nitrogen in your blood is low.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.896
Touya, are you saying that--

09:23.980 --> 09:27.149
Yeah. It might be possible
to go outside in an ONIQLO.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.944
But didn't you say
you would burst in an ONIQLO?

09:30.027 --> 09:33.072
That's if you put in air
at one atmosphere of pressure.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.366
Are you talking about decompression?

09:36.659 --> 09:38.869
What the hell is wrong
with this space suit?

09:38.953 --> 09:41.372
<i>That's the suit for total beginners.</i>

09:41.455 --> 09:43.708
I can't connect to the Internet.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.460
Well, I'm in a bubble for children.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.671
I wanted to do an EVA.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.173
Full systems check.

09:51.257 --> 09:55.177
Suit, check. Oxygen, check.
Communications, check.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.596
Closing the hatch.

09:58.055 --> 10:00.433
-Airtightness call.
-<i>Airtight, check.</i>

10:00.516 --> 10:03.603
Konoha, disengage
the atmospheric-pressure suit lock.

10:05.396 --> 10:08.399
<i>Konoha and Mina will secure Nasa</i>
<i>to a wheelchair.</i>

10:08.899 --> 10:10.901
Closing the decompression room.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.447
We will leave last.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.699
We will decompress as we walk,

10:16.782 --> 10:18.951
but we don't have enough time
to fully decompress.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.581
We will get decompression sickness,
but we won't die.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.251
You will feel intense pain and nausea,

10:27.335 --> 10:30.296
but you have to tolerate it
until you get to the other side.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.674
Okay, here we go!

10:38.554 --> 10:40.640
Listen to me, Earthers.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.559
We off-Earthers have a duty

10:43.643 --> 10:48.230
to protect and preserve untrained Earthers
in times like these.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.861
No matter what, we will keep you alive
and return you to Earth.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.238
Walk to that Mars dome.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.078
Chief,
don't let Hakase roll off the pathway.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.121
Everyone, follow behind the chief.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.543
My suit is inflating. I can't walk.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.587
Let the air out of your suit.

11:17.468 --> 11:20.805
Doesn't the Earth look a little closer
than it did before?

11:27.144 --> 11:30.064
Why is there snow over there?

11:30.731 --> 11:32.942
What is that pattern?

11:33.025 --> 11:34.318
It's an "S" Pattern.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.821
Nasa, are you all right?

11:36.904 --> 11:41.659
It is a sacred formula that appears
over and over in the <i>Seven Poem</i>.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.244
The "S" Pattern?

11:44.703 --> 11:46.956
Comet?

11:49.417 --> 11:53.003
-Konoha, what's the matter?
-Konoha, keep walking!

11:53.087 --> 11:54.755
A comet.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.509
A comet is coming.

12:01.095 --> 12:04.473
-Why is a comet heading this way?
-And at such a time!

12:06.183 --> 12:09.186
-Where am I?
-Chief, you back with us?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.147
Yes. What's the situation now?

12:11.230 --> 12:13.983
There's comet debris coming this way.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.485
It seems the time has come to use it.

12:17.069 --> 12:20.239
Body-expanse operation!

12:22.199 --> 12:23.367
How macho!

12:31.709 --> 12:33.836
-The comet!
-Run!

12:57.818 --> 12:58.819
Taiyou!

13:11.248 --> 13:12.249
Taiyou!

13:24.970 --> 13:26.430
Oh, no.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.730
Just a little farther. Reach for--

13:45.157 --> 13:46.492
Remove the tether.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.953
Damn it, I can't.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.332
I can't hold on any longer.

13:54.041 --> 13:57.002
It's pulling me!

14:06.136 --> 14:10.182
Not bad for an Earther.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.267
You too.

14:12.184 --> 14:16.772
Touya,
an hour ago you said Earthers should die.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.150
Shut up, Earther.

14:26.532 --> 14:31.036
I treated you guys like idiots
because you are Earthers,

14:31.620 --> 14:33.664
but you're not so bad.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.958
I'm honored!

14:36.041 --> 14:38.544
You don't have to force yourself
to say leader-like things.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.631
Detachment function not in operation.
Detachment--

14:42.715 --> 14:45.050
I'm never wearing this space suit again!

14:45.968 --> 14:49.430
If we climb up here, we should be able
to get to the control room.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.765
What is this grater-like thing?

14:51.849 --> 14:53.642
The heavy bulkhead is closed.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.311
Can't we open it manually?

14:55.394 --> 14:58.606
We can't open heavy bulkheads
without Twelve.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.442
Another dead end?

15:03.193 --> 15:05.487
The wall's wireless charger is working.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.073
The electrical network
is starting to self-repair.

15:08.157 --> 15:12.036
If I can bypass this,
I can probably restore it.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.458
Electricity!

15:20.044 --> 15:23.213
This is the Mars Development
Historical Museum.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.674
Ready, go.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.307
Incidentally,
isn't this surface a little unusual?

15:33.390 --> 15:34.934
You're right.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.102
The ground is turning.

15:37.645 --> 15:38.896
I see.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.691
Look,
it's because the rotations make gravity.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.944
The ground is turning on this circle.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.403
See?

15:47.071 --> 15:50.032
The gravity on this side is tilted.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.951
I do wired recharging.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.035
PATHWAY TO C CYLINDER CLOSED

15:53.118 --> 15:54.954
There's a breach in this pathway too?

15:55.037 --> 15:57.081
So this is another dead end.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.625
How long will this fabric bulkhead last?

15:59.708 --> 16:01.085
About half a day, I think.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.545
Can we use the convenience store?

16:03.629 --> 16:04.922
My treat.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.006
GENUINE PRODUCTS

16:06.090 --> 16:08.425
Gather the necessary supplies
and eat what you want.

16:09.426 --> 16:12.096
-Mighty Anshin-kun!
-With pleasure.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.016
Thank goodness. It still works.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.526
The "S" Pattern.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.194
Nasa mentioned it earlier.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.870
What? "Comet water."

16:36.954 --> 16:40.082
This is the comet water
picked up on the rocket, isn't it?

16:40.165 --> 16:41.792
It's not from the rocket.

16:41.875 --> 16:45.004
The comet itself is melted down,
turned into plasma and injected.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.923
Ah, plasma. Yes. I know.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.675
Plasma is tasty, isn't it?

16:50.676 --> 16:52.094
Damn it.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.096
Can't see it from here either.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.682
What's the matter, Touya?

16:56.765 --> 16:59.560
I want to check
if the control room is secure.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.229
Yeah, can't see it from here.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.150
If only we had an Internet connection,

17:06.233 --> 17:08.694
I would be able to see it
with my cyber glasses.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.404
OUT OF RANGE

17:10.487 --> 17:11.655
Uncle.

17:12.448 --> 17:16.368
We'll definitely be able to see it
from another window. I'll go look.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.122
UNCLE, STILL ALIVE? REPLY.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.373
MESSAGE FAILED TO SEND

17:21.457 --> 17:23.917
It's supposed to be right above.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.627
Touya.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.384
Thanks for before.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.636
Yeah, you too.

17:35.763 --> 17:40.809
This comet water was also harvested
by Seven Technology, wasn't it?

17:40.893 --> 17:42.269
That's right.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.938
Even so, it's just normal water, isn't it?

17:45.022 --> 17:46.148
Yeah.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.862
I bet you hate Seven, don't you?

17:55.157 --> 18:01.246
Lunatic is probably behind Seven's
design flaws in your implants.

18:02.623 --> 18:06.460
I still don't know a lot about Lunatic.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.254
The Seven on the moon's surface

18:09.338 --> 18:12.299
back then dramatically advanced
their intelligence without reason.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.218
They lost control,

18:14.301 --> 18:17.304
and eventually the "Frame" intelligence
framework was destroyed on its own,

18:17.387 --> 18:18.806
and the intelligence collapsed.

18:19.890 --> 18:23.852
They also lost control of the products
designed by Seven in a chain reaction,

18:23.936 --> 18:26.230
and many accidents
occurred around the globe.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.650
We found out that
the number of casualties from this event

18:29.733 --> 18:31.693
was in the thousands.

18:33.153 --> 18:38.242
UN2 made cognitive limiters compulsory
in order to prevent another Lunatic,

18:38.909 --> 18:41.161
so that a disaster like that
never happens again.

18:42.871 --> 18:46.166
As your friend, I want to help you.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.628
Hand over that drone.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.006
Please let me do the right thing.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.968
You don't have to wake up Lunatic.

18:56.051 --> 19:00.055
If my dad uses his connections at UN2,
we can find a solution for your implant.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.473
No.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.226
Why not?

19:04.768 --> 19:07.312
You couldn't possibly want
to cause another event like Seven.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.856
You don't understand anything.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.151
Don't you hate Seven?

19:12.234 --> 19:14.736
If Seven had used cognitive limiters,

19:14.820 --> 19:17.447
you never would have had
to suffer like this.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.116
Yeah.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.743
If we didn't have the Seven implants,

19:21.827 --> 19:24.955
we would have died
when we were even younger.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.041
I told you before.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.919
The implants worked when we were little.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.463
If limiters were put on by Seven,

19:33.547 --> 19:36.675
we would have died at three
like the other ten did.

19:36.758 --> 19:37.926
But--

19:38.010 --> 19:40.053
Seven didn't fail.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.015
It just found a method
that didn't work well.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.642
But will you sacrifice yourself for that?

19:46.226 --> 19:48.687
-You'll die.
-I'm not dead yet.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.480
What about Konoha?

19:50.564 --> 19:54.818
If Seven hadn't been euthanized,
its intelligence would have expanded

19:54.902 --> 19:58.030
and it eventually would have found
a method that succeeded.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.490
It's UN2 that failed.

20:02.618 --> 20:06.246
I'm going to destroy
all of the UN2's cognitive limiters,

20:06.330 --> 20:09.416
complete an AI that surpasses Seven

20:09.499 --> 20:11.126
and live.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.128
I'm not going to die.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.796
Neither will Konoha.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.302
I'm not done talking!

20:21.803 --> 20:23.305
The pain is back.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.890
Nasa.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.309
There's a Smart printer
at the convenience store.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.812
We're having a print-spree.
Isn't this great?

20:30.896 --> 20:34.566
Your Smart is the old seal-style one,
isn't it?

20:34.650 --> 20:36.193
Get this one.

20:36.276 --> 20:39.112
Well, I'm happy with this one.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.698
Is that a printer too?

20:41.782 --> 20:44.576
Yes. I thought I could make a brace.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.495
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

20:46.578 --> 20:49.623
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt anymore.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.083
Oops!

20:53.335 --> 20:58.298
Nasa, thank you for protecting us.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.634
Thank you.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.302
Oh, no.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.931
I mean, it's my job
to ensure the safety of our guests.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.474
How is your injury?

21:07.557 --> 21:09.893
I'm totally fine now.

21:09.977 --> 21:13.146
I'm in charge
of this station's health care after all.

21:13.647 --> 21:16.608
See? Now quit bothering me
and go play over there.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.652
I hate kids, you know.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.153
-Okay.
-Okay.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.864
I'm tired.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.743
I really can't stand kids.
Yet kids love me.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.413
Ouch.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.249
We must hurry.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.755
-The sun set.
-It's night mode.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.760
The Seven that surpassed
human intelligence and fell to Lunatic

21:43.844 --> 21:47.723
kept spitting out cryptic formulas
that didn't make sense

21:47.806 --> 21:50.142
and caused numerous accidents.

21:50.225 --> 21:53.520
That's the <i>Seven Poem</i>, right?
It was in the <i>Monthly Mar</i> magazine.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.604
THE TRUTH OF LUNATIC SEVEN

21:54.688 --> 21:57.691
False rumors started spreading that it was
an encrypted prophecy of the future,

21:57.774 --> 22:02.029
and the UN2 as well as some
research institutions tried to solve it.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.739
But there was no correct answer.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.283
It was only used as an excuse
for occultists to make money

22:06.366 --> 22:09.786
and by groups like John Doe
to carry out terrorist acts.

22:10.912 --> 22:14.708
But there is still information
that has not been publicized.

22:14.791 --> 22:17.753
Somebody actually deciphered
a small portion of it.

22:19.087 --> 22:21.131
This is what it said.

22:22.007 --> 22:27.429
36.79% of humanity
needed to be euthanized right away.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.433
That's true, isn't it?

22:32.059 --> 22:35.812
My father wanted to go public with it,

22:35.896 --> 22:38.565
and he lost his position at the UN2.

22:39.149 --> 22:42.152
In order to restore my father's name,

22:42.235 --> 22:44.654
I want to tell the world
the truth about Lunatic

22:44.738 --> 22:47.324
and restore the UN2 to its original form.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.202
Do you know the truth?

22:51.411 --> 22:54.623
Before Lunatic, Seven said this,

22:55.290 --> 22:57.876
that humanity must leave its cradle

22:57.959 --> 23:01.213
and have and raise children off of Earth.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.758
Back then, ten children died on the moon,

23:05.300 --> 23:08.929
and then most humans ended up
opposing space exploration.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.808
They said humans needed
to return to Earth.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.977
But where are we supposed to go home to?

23:16.603 --> 23:19.439
Those of us who cannot
withstand Earth's gravity

23:20.065 --> 23:22.567
have no home to return to.

23:25.403 --> 23:28.240
Seven was our only ally.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.784
Seven's words alone

23:31.660 --> 23:34.371
have supported me and Konoha
this entire time.

23:35.705 --> 23:38.083
I guess what I said is useless.

23:39.334 --> 23:41.169
Let's talk later.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.925
It's a little different
from the <i>Seven Poem</i> again.

23:47.008 --> 23:49.928
Yes, it's rushing into a new branch.

23:51.054 --> 23:52.264
Konoha.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.599
I brought a first aid kit.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.018
Oh, thanks.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.562
Ouch.

23:58.645 --> 24:01.773
Is there an auto-diagnosis patch?
It looks like a compress.

24:02.732 --> 24:04.526
-This?
-Yeah.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.111
Oh, it hurts.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.238
Nasa, am I--

24:09.990 --> 24:11.741
Am I going to die soon?

24:12.284 --> 24:14.786
What's brought this on all of a sudden?

24:14.870 --> 24:19.875
I've been light-headed lately,
and it's getting worse.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.002
Don't be silly.

24:22.085 --> 24:24.504
I'm the one who looks more likely to die.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.883
Why do you say that?

24:29.092 --> 24:32.762
You know a lot about Seven, don't you?

24:34.848 --> 24:38.018
I wonder how Seven felt.

24:39.769 --> 24:41.605
Right before Seven died,

24:41.688 --> 24:44.774
it was the smartest it had ever been.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.986
It was also able
to see everything in the future,

24:48.069 --> 24:50.197
so it left the <i>Seven Poem</i>.

24:51.781 --> 24:55.619
That means it knew it was going to die,
didn't it?

24:58.496 --> 25:02.334
It saw its own death,
the end of the world. It saw everything.

25:02.417 --> 25:06.463
Even so, it continued to look
into the future for humanity's sake.

25:08.173 --> 25:12.552
I feel like I kind of understand
how Seven felt.

25:12.636 --> 25:13.887
Konoha.

25:14.512 --> 25:19.559
Surely it saw through everything--
as if it were clear, clean water--

25:21.144 --> 25:24.022
and it died with no regrets.

25:25.315 --> 25:27.943
When I think about that, I--

25:29.527 --> 25:32.030
I'm no longer afraid of dying.

25:36.451 --> 25:39.162
It let me live 14 years.

25:40.705 --> 25:44.793
If Seven says I am going to die soon,

25:45.627 --> 25:47.837
-I have peace of mind--
-Konoha.

25:49.005 --> 25:51.174
We will all die.

25:51.258 --> 25:53.134
That's a fact.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.053
But not now.

25:55.762 --> 25:59.224
Also, the future will end soon.

25:59.307 --> 26:00.308
What?

26:00.392 --> 26:02.227
The fixed future, that is.

26:02.852 --> 26:05.772
The <i>Seven Poem</i> is the story of the end.

26:07.065 --> 26:10.235
Oh, yeah. I'll tell you a special secret.

26:12.529 --> 26:13.697
FiTsZ.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.741
FiTsZ.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.618
It's a secret word.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.036
Memorize it.

26:22.080 --> 26:26.126
My cyber glasses can connect
to the Internet and peer comms.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.127
SPACE DRONE PHOTOS

26:27.210 --> 26:28.878
A sightseeing drone.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.758
Touya!

26:35.427 --> 26:36.970
I figured it out.

26:37.053 --> 26:41.182
We can connect the photo drone
for tourists to peer-to-peer.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.935
We have a way to do that?

26:45.729 --> 26:47.022
It connected.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.153
The video has come through.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.865
That's the crab that pinched me earlier.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.745
The shuttle. There's no shuttle.

27:01.828 --> 27:04.080
The entire shuttle area is gone.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.833
-The shuttle!
-I can see it!

27:11.171 --> 27:13.798
What a relief. The control room is safe.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.470
No way.

27:18.553 --> 27:22.057
No one will die on this station today.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.350
Nobody.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.101
Uncle.

27:25.185 --> 27:28.396
Touya, don't give up yet. Think.

27:29.147 --> 27:32.108
When the control room
is no longer usable--

27:32.192 --> 27:35.403
-Touya, the sub-control room.
-That's right.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.659
There's light.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.578
People.

27:44.454 --> 27:45.747
Uncle!

27:46.748 --> 27:48.416
Sagami.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.296
We're in a vacuum,
so we can't talk with them like this.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.674
It's a laser transmission.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.931
-<i>Touya, are you safe?</i>
-Uncle!

28:03.014 --> 28:04.140
It's Nasa.

28:04.224 --> 28:07.852
I am with the three Earthers,
Konoha and the chief.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.855
<i>Great. That means everyone has survived.</i>

28:10.939 --> 28:13.775
<i>You've done a great job. Where are you?</i>

28:14.359 --> 28:16.694
In the B Cylinder, Mars Floor.

28:17.195 --> 28:21.199
<i>Touya, you have to survive long enough</i>
<i>for the UN2 rescue ship to come.</i>

28:21.282 --> 28:22.617
We will.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.745
The night is over.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.123
Just a little longer, guys.

28:28.706 --> 28:30.667
We're going to solve the problem.

29:55.835 --> 29:59.255
