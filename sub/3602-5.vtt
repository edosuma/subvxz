you must tell me

No.

I'm fine.
I just want to go home.

The doctors just want
to run some tests first.

All right, look,
I'll pay you. Okay?
You name it.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.879
We just need to know
a couple of things.
That's all.

03:56.779 --> 03:59.737
That was entirely
unnecessary.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.115
You might as well go ahead
and shoot now,

04:05.329 --> 04:07.069
because I'll find you,
and lwiII kill you.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.745
Unlikely, Mr. Petrelli.

04:08.833 --> 04:09.913
I've seen your faces.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.207
That, I'm afraid,
won't be a problem.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.625
Put him down.

04:54.295 --> 04:57.537
Where is he? What did you do
with Mr. Petrelli?

04:59.091 --> 05:02.549

where is he?

05:03.012 --> 05:04.468

how I got here.

Don't even think about it.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.999
Feel free to go home,
secure in your solvency.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.422
What did you do to me?

05:46.514 --> 05:48.050
As I saw it,

05:48.140 --> 05:50.552
a lot of things
were done to you.

05:51.060 --> 05:54.052
However, none of them by me.

05:55.231 --> 05:56.687
No.

05:56.774 --> 05:57.934
I left.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.099
I didn't go through with it.

06:00.194 --> 06:03.436
Mr. Linderman
reviewed the tape,
and needless to say,

06:03.531 --> 06:05.487
was quite pleased
with your performance.

06:12.039 --> 06:16.248
Either that's you or you
still owe Mr. Linderman
$50,000.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.540
Go home to your son,
Miss Sanders.

06:21.257 --> 06:23.043
And tell him his mommy
doesn't have to worry

06:23.133 --> 06:25.624
about people asking
for their money anymore.

06:30.516 --> 06:31.972
He was right there.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.970
But then
he teleported away?

06:36.814 --> 06:38.554
He stopped time somehow.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.139
He talked to me.
He knew who I was.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.225
He says that
we all meet up somehow,

06:42.319 --> 06:44.571
sometime in the future
lguess.

06:44.655 --> 06:47.146
It seems crazy,
but I know what I saw.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.570
He said something bad is
going to happen,
but we can stop it.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.401
First we have to...

06:55.291 --> 06:56.747
Save a cheerleader.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.074
A cheerleader?

06:58.168 --> 06:59.704
Look, it seems
impossible, I know.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.626
Impossible? It sounds mad.

07:01.714 --> 07:02.794
Please, just...

07:03.799 --> 07:06.415
He said I have to go back
to see lsaac the painter.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.011
Okay? That he's going to know
what we have to do.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.926
So, let's just go back
to his loft.

07:10.014 --> 07:11.379
All right, if the answer
isn't there

07:11.473 --> 07:14.886
I promise
that I will drive you
to the airport myself.

07:15.394 --> 07:16.679
You can go back to India

07:16.770 --> 07:19.512
and you never have to
hear from me again.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.224
Will you fly me there
yourself?

07:26.196 --> 07:29.688
There are no answers.
Go home, Peter.

07:40.919 --> 07:44.047
Someone there has to be able
to do something to find him.

07:45.466 --> 07:48.879
No, he went out on assignment,
and he hasn't
checked in since.

07:52.931 --> 07:57.015
Look, will you just have
Detective McHenry call me?

07:57.895 --> 07:58.884

08:04.693 --> 08:07.070
Never mind. He's home.

08:11.075 --> 08:12.064
Hey.

08:12.618 --> 08:15.781
Where the hell have you been?
Do you know how worried I was?

08:16.455 --> 08:18.992
I must have drank too much
and passed out on the couch.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.578
Do we have any aspirin?

08:22.127 --> 08:23.833
You have been gone
for a day.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.127
What? That's impossible.

08:25.214 --> 08:26.249
No, it isn't.
Trust me.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.171
I've been awake
for every hour of it.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.839
I called the precinct
a dozen times

08:29.927 --> 08:32.384
and they said
you were working
with the FBI.

08:38.769 --> 08:41.761
Yeah. I just started.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.685
I was going to tell you
about that, but...

08:45.776 --> 08:46.891
But what?

08:48.612 --> 08:50.113
Where were you?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.275
I was...

08:57.579 --> 08:58.705
I don't know.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.279
You don't know?

what I've just been through?

in a ditch somewhere.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.419
And then every time
the phone would ring

09:07.506 --> 09:09.872
I'd think it was somebody
calling to tell me that...

but you've barely
spoken to me lately

sessions, Janice.

09:30.154 --> 09:32.361

had happened to you?

09:35.659 --> 09:37.320

to try and find an answer,
how to stop it.

to saving us.

have to finish this.

You have to finish
the painting.

29:39.904 --> 29:41.440
Even if I wanted to, I can't.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.782
I'm out of drugs,
and I'm out of money
to buy drugs.

29:43.866 --> 29:46.482
Can't you just finish it
without shooting up?

29:46.577 --> 29:48.659
If you've got
some cash on you, man.

29:48.746 --> 29:52.614
That's another story.
We'll call it a commission.

30:22.446 --> 30:24.562
I saw it.
What?

30:27.827 --> 30:31.240
I saw something
in the canvas, the picture.

30:31.956 --> 30:35.369
This painting,
I can finish it.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.374
You can paint?

30:37.503 --> 30:40.620
No. No, I can't. But...

30:42.633 --> 30:45.591
I drew the future
after I saw you
the other day.

30:45.678 --> 30:47.259
It was only stick figures,

30:51.225 --> 30:52.590
but it came true.

31:37.938 --> 31:39.144
Hi, Brody.

31:41.275 --> 31:42.890
I know you probably don't want
to see me right now

31:42.985 --> 31:44.600
or hear what I have to say,

31:45.821 --> 31:47.357
but I have to say it.

31:49.116 --> 31:54.327
What you did to me,
what you tried to do
was wrong.

was wrong, too,
and I'm sorry.

a few hours ago.

Did he try
to contact you at all
in the past few days?

33:00.396 --> 33:01.977
My dad didn't do anything.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.894
Micah,
I need you to wait with Tina
for another minute, okay?

33:06.026 --> 33:08.813
Ma'am, your husband
was spotted at
a convenient store

33:08.904 --> 33:10.405
not far from here
about an hour ago.

33:10.489 --> 33:11.524
He's here?

33:11.615 --> 33:14.152
No sign of him yet.
But we've got cars
hidden around the block

33:14.243 --> 33:15.449
in case he tries
to make contact.

33:15.536 --> 33:17.697
D.L.‘s been on the run
for six months.

33:17.955 --> 33:20.571
Why haven't you caught him?
We had him in custody
two days ago.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.782
He pulled a Houdini,
slipped out of his cuffs.

33:23.794 --> 33:26.331
D.L. Hawkings is a killer.

33:26.839 --> 33:29.251
He has been following me

33:30.050 --> 33:31.961
doing things.
What sort of things?

33:33.095 --> 33:36.587
Look, if he's here,
he wants something.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.843
And I won't be able
to stop him.

33:38.934 --> 33:40.595
You need to protect us.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.476
OFFICER ON RAD/O:
We’ve got someone coming.

33:42.563 --> 33:44.645
He’s headed for the house.
Get these people safe.

33:45.441 --> 33:48.933
He’s headed for the back door.
Repeat, cover the back door.

33:57.745 --> 33:58.734
Dad.

33:59.955 --> 34:01.991
Freeze! Hands up!

34:03.083 --> 34:04.118
Hands up!

34:08.964 --> 34:09.953
Niki?

34:16.847 --> 34:18.838
Your men are worried
about you, Mr. Petrelli.

34:18.933 --> 34:20.139
Are you all right?

34:20.226 --> 34:21.466
I'm fine,

34:21.560 --> 34:24.302
but I can't say I'm pleased
with the security situation.

34:24.647 --> 34:26.558
You have the hotel's
sincerest apologies.

34:26.649 --> 34:28.435
Consider your stay on us.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.523
If there's anything else
you need, just ask.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.483
Actually I was wondering
how that tape turned out.

34:36.075 --> 34:38.191
Consider it a favor
you'll repay one day.

34:40.496 --> 34:41.656
Or what?

34:43.207 --> 34:47.325
For a man
whose campaign is founded
on sound family values,

34:47.670 --> 34:50.161
this could be
really embarrassing for you.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.338
Especially considering
your wife.

34:54.051 --> 34:57.134
On the other hand, that tape
really isn't worth much
unless I win, is it?

34:59.014 --> 35:02.381
Why don't you just give me
my four million
and I'll fly back to New York

35:02.518 --> 35:05.260
and put it to good use?
Our agreement
was two million.

35:05.354 --> 35:08.187
That's rather generous.
Yeah, I thought so, too.

35:08.524 --> 35:09.639
And then I thought,

35:09.733 --> 35:13.146
"Gee, it must be
pretty important for Linderman
to see me in office

35:13.237 --> 35:16.229
"if he's willing
to go to this much trouble
to keep me in line."

35:17.408 --> 35:20.571
Two million dollars makes me
a candidate in your pocket.

35:21.287 --> 35:24.029
Four million
makes me a congressman.

35:28.002 --> 35:29.492
That was so...

35:30.462 --> 35:32.748
I love you. I love you.

35:33.132 --> 35:36.169
It's like you're in my head.
It's like...

35:41.890 --> 35:43.676
What can I get you?
Nothing.

35:44.143 --> 35:46.429
Just sleep for a week.

35:50.357 --> 35:51.767
Coffee ice cream?

35:52.443 --> 35:55.150
You got it.
Coffee ice cream coming up.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.505
I skipped lunch.

hundred in cash, too.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.104
Hey.

37:15.109 --> 37:16.815
Look, I know why you're here.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.767
And I just want to say
don't do this.

37:18.862 --> 37:20.318
What the hell do you know?

37:20.989 --> 37:22.149
Nothing.

37:23.242 --> 37:24.573
But I'm a cop.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.241
But I am not armed.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.407
Okay, ljust came in here
to get some ice cream
for my wife,

37:29.498 --> 37:31.329
but I know what you're
thinking about doing.

37:31.417 --> 37:36.036
I know that you could
pull out the gun
that you've got in there,

37:36.338 --> 37:37.748
and you could shoot me.

37:37.840 --> 37:41.048
But then you'd be
throwing your life away.
For what?

37:41.135 --> 37:43.467
A couple of twenties
in the register? Huh?

37:44.263 --> 37:45.753
Look, I know you're hurting.

37:47.224 --> 37:52.093
But Marie is waiting for you
at home, right?

37:52.187 --> 37:53.893
And Vincent
is getting out in a month.

37:55.399 --> 37:57.014
All you have to do

37:57.484 --> 38:00.100
is just take your hand
out of your jacket pocket,

38:00.195 --> 38:03.028
and put the gun down,
and get out of here.

38:18.839 --> 38:21.296
WOMAN: Oh, my God,
is that a gun?

38:21.383 --> 38:22.623
He’s got a gun.

38:22.718 --> 38:24.003
No,no,no,no,no.
Don’t shoot me.

38:24.094 --> 38:25.675
Call the cops.
I'm a cop.

38:25.762 --> 38:27.627
Doesn’t look
like police to me.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.304
I can’t believe
this is happening.

38:29.391 --> 38:31.177
MATT: It's okay, I'm a cop.
What’s wrong with him?

38:31.268 --> 38:32.758
Probably crazy.

38:33.645 --> 38:36.853
Don’t shoot me.
It's okay, I'm a cop.

38:36.982 --> 38:40.224
I just want
to get out of here.
Someone call the police.

38:43.739 --> 38:45.275

39:05.886 --> 39:08.423

I live here.

was going to happen?

I'm sorry.

that's not me.

You get the difference,
right?

39:40.629 --> 39:42.165
Do you understand?

39:43.340 --> 39:45.296
Do you want us
to take him in
for trespassing?

39:47.511 --> 39:50.378
Just let him go home.
