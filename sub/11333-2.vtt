produce news stories.

have to go?

09:29.444 --> 09:31.738
Sure. Of course.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.323
Fabulous.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.324
Oh, and we have
to reschedule...

09:34.449 --> 09:35.992
Yeah.
immediately.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.869
Well, I'll have to see
if I can, uh,

09:37.994 --> 09:39.287
move some things around.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.955
Oh, here.
Could you help?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.041
Sure.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.625
Thank you.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.127
Mm-hmm.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.256
You know, between you and me,
pearls remind me of old ladies.

09:49.381 --> 09:53.176
I feel like I should be storing
tissue in my bosom or something.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.970
Um, you could always
not wear them.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.847
Mm.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.391
I wish.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.476
But Gregory bought
them for me.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.019
He's the friend
I'm seeing tonight.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.105
So, anyway.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.314
Here.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.442
Uh, sure.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.070
So, welcome back.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.321
Thank you.
Tell me.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.282
Did you absolutely
love Vietnam?

10:15.407 --> 10:17.242
I went bananas
my first time there.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.202
Yeah, well, I'm guessing
your Vietnam and my Vietnam

10:19.327 --> 10:21.162
were a little
different.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.373
Bach Ma National Park
is Bach Ma National Park.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.375
I don't care where you sleep
after seeing it.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.626
You did Bach Ma National Park?

10:29.003 --> 10:30.922
That's a pretty gnarly
hike getting up there.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.882
What are you implying?

10:33.007 --> 10:35.218
That I don't do gnarly?

10:35.343 --> 10:36.677
That you don't do hike.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.056
Okay, fine.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.349
I helicoptered to the top.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.684
But there were plenty
of sweaty hikers up there

10:43.810 --> 10:45.770
who told me all about
how steep it was.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.939
(clears throat)

10:48.064 --> 10:48.815
(doorbell rings)

10:48.940 --> 10:50.024
Oh.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.985
Boo. Already.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.153
What a drag.

10:56.239 --> 10:59.159
Gregory, hello.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.161
You look beautiful.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.455
Thank you. Ah,
this is my dear friend Ryan.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.832
He's a teacher
at Naomi's school.

11:05.957 --> 11:08.793
I double-booked tonight.
I'm atrocious I know.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.211
Shall we go?

11:13.881 --> 11:15.383
JEN:
Bye, Ryan.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.098
NAVID:
Okay, we are good on the news.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.224
All we need now

11:23.350 --> 11:25.268
is another segment.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.269
You know, a
lifestyle piece.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.271
Something buzz worthy.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.023
BOY:
I got a no-brainer.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.983
Yeah?
Rumor has it,

11:32.108 --> 11:32.984
there's a naked picture
of the principal's daughter

11:33.109 --> 11:35.111
out there.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.196
A sex text, people.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.989
No, absolutely not.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.324
That's out of the question.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.283
Guaranteed
eyeballs, dude.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.451
No, The Blaze is not

11:41.576 --> 11:42.785
in the business of slinging mud.

11:42.910 --> 11:43.828
Other pitches. Think
positive, people.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.998
Uh, think "only Beverly Hills."

11:47.123 --> 11:48.375
All right, boss man,
I got one for ya.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.750
Whatcha got?

11:49.876 --> 11:51.794
New student just transferred
to West Bev.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.421
Apparently, he placed second
in this big deal

11:53.547 --> 11:55.006
national tennis
tournament.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.008
Apparently, he's going to go pro
in a year.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.343
Interesting story, right?

11:58.468 --> 11:59.511
Balancing a pro tennis career

11:59.636 --> 12:01.429
with high school.
Uh, do you have a name?

12:01.555 --> 12:02.556
Teddy Montgomery.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.183
As in the son
of Spence Montgomery.

12:05.308 --> 12:08.478
Major movie star,
people, come on.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.522
Yeah. That's perfect!
Yeah.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.191
But I sussed him out, and he has
some "no interview" policy.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.693
Apparently,
his dad's been

12:14.817 --> 12:16.027
burned in the media
a couple times.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.195
(sighs)

12:17.320 --> 12:18.279
(clicks tongue)

12:18.405 --> 12:19.364
Damn.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.032
Hmm. Damn, damn, damn.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.158
That-that would've been perfect.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.826
Ah, that sucks.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.119
Anyway,

12:25.245 --> 12:26.996
um, any other ideas?
Anyone else?
Uh, Navid,

12:27.121 --> 12:28.331
if you really want
to interview Teddy,

12:28.456 --> 12:29.416
I can ask him to make

12:29.541 --> 12:30.875
an exception.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.377
He might do it,
since we're old friends.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.462
GIRL:
Really?
Mm-hmm.

12:34.588 --> 12:35.380
That'd be friggin' awesome.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.674
Right?
Uh...

12:37.798 --> 12:39.884
No, that-that'd be
friggin' awesome.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.052
Yeah.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.182
(sighs)

12:46.307 --> 12:48.268
(phone rings)

12:51.271 --> 12:53.022
(under breath):
Oh.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.110
Hello?

12:57.235 --> 12:58.903
Annie. Hi.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.905
Hi.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.199
Hi.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.827
Sorry.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.204
This... this is awkward.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.457
Uh, you called me.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.041
So...

13:12.166 --> 13:14.419
Look, I-I heard a rumor tonight,

13:14.544 --> 13:16.421
and I wanted to tell you.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.381
Because... if it were me,

13:18.506 --> 13:20.300
I would want to know.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.719
What is it?

13:22.843 --> 13:25.054
Okay, apparently someone has
a text of you.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.514
Like...

13:26.640 --> 13:28.141
like a naked text.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.394
Oh... oh, my God.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.229
It might just be a rumor...

13:33.354 --> 13:34.314
Um, I-I have to go.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.274
I have to go. Bye.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.321
(laughs):
What?

13:41.446 --> 13:43.072
Yeah, I-I just, uh,

13:43.197 --> 13:44.949
wanted you to know the rumor,
dude.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.003
Yeah, um, look, thing is,

13:57.128 --> 13:59.130
me and Annie, we're-we're
doing our own thing now.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.382
So, uh, I'm done dealing
with her crap.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.967
All right?

14:03.092 --> 14:04.843
I'll talk to you later, man.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.895
You know, Ade, I've
been thinking.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.148
The Teddy story's
a little soft.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.149
I was thinking

14:18.274 --> 14:19.609
about covering the sex piece.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.653
What?
Well, I won't
mention

14:21.778 --> 14:22.821
Annie's name.
I'll just, you know,

14:22.945 --> 14:24.113
talk about the phenomenon
in general.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.448
I mean, sex texts

14:25.573 --> 14:27.659
are big in high school.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.744
Okay, Navid, you can't do that.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.621
Everyone will know
it's about Annie.

14:31.746 --> 14:32.580
Yeah, but we need
a great story.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.290
And you have one.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.500
Teddy, remember?

14:35.625 --> 14:37.418
Come on.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.086
That's not nearly
as interesting.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.921
No, but it is! Honestly,

14:41.047 --> 14:43.591
you have no idea how juicy
Teddy's life is.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.343
His godfather
is Marlon Brando.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.345
Could you imagine?

14:47.470 --> 14:49.597
Baby, you can't do

14:49.723 --> 14:51.599
the sext.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.101
But Teddy is amazing.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.479
Trust me.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.731
He is beyond amazing.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.026
COLLEEN:
You were completely
out of line.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.486
You don't talk to people
that way.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.154
But Jen is psychotic.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.906
And I don't care about Jen.
I care about you.

15:10.368 --> 15:11.994
Look at me.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.872
She said

15:13.996 --> 15:15.331
Naomi asked you
to stay away from her.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.457
Is that true?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.043
Well, okay, then.
That's it.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.503
When someone says
they are done with you,

15:20.628 --> 15:21.379
you've gotta believe them.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.928
Remember what
they taught you in Utah.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.639
Stay away from people
who trigger bad behavior.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.224
People like Naomi.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.351
I know.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.645
I know.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.523
Just stick to the plan, honey.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.900
You need structure.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.276
Downtime is when you get
into trouble.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.153
You're still going to join
a team, right?

15:46.279 --> 15:47.614
Good.

15:47.739 --> 15:48.698
You'll make some friends,

15:48.823 --> 15:50.408
like you had on
Long Island.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.326
It's not going to be the same.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.369
So here's a question.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.537
How hard could it possibly be

15:54.662 --> 15:56.664
to make a flower garden
symmetrical? Hmm?

15:56.790 --> 15:58.207
Hi, honey.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.292
MAN:
Hey, baby.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.001
Liam.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.587
So I asked
the gardener

16:02.712 --> 16:04.839
to trim back the roses
a little bit, right?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.091
I get there and the
left side is about

16:07.216 --> 16:08.927
six inches wider
than the right.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.511
Now could you imagine
what would happen

16:10.637 --> 16:12.263
if I did that kind of shoddy
work in my business?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.599
(laughs)
Hey, maybe that's the answer.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.810
What I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna
invite the gardener's wife

16:16.935 --> 16:19.270
over for a little
plastic surgery,

16:19.395 --> 16:21.564
and I'm going to give her
one big beautiful

16:21.689 --> 16:24.400
D-cup and tiny little A-cup.
Hmm?

16:24.525 --> 16:26.193
That's a good idea--
bully the gardener.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.571
Hey.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.239
Correct me if I'm wrong,

16:30.364 --> 16:32.158
but I thought the
whole idea of my

16:32.283 --> 16:35.536
dropping $20,000 so you
could sleep in a tent

16:35.662 --> 16:37.538
was so that you would lose
the attitude problem.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.623
Just saying.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.124
That's enough, Liam.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.208
Help me, honey.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.085
I want a decaf.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.629
(sighs)

16:44.754 --> 16:46.631
Walking on thin
ice, young man.

16:46.756 --> 16:47.799
You know,
you're very lucky

16:47.924 --> 16:49.258
I didn't call the police
and tell them

16:49.383 --> 16:51.051
how you stole my patient's
credit cards last year.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.680
Liam knows,

16:53.805 --> 16:55.598
and he's grateful.
Mm.

16:55.723 --> 16:56.641
He better be grateful.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.768
'Cause if I see a sign

16:58.893 --> 17:01.061
of any bad behavior from
you, I'm making the call,

17:01.187 --> 17:02.605
young man,
and trust me,

17:02.730 --> 17:04.397
juvie is nothing at all

17:04.523 --> 17:06.984
like your little mamby-pamby

17:07.108 --> 17:09.403
"Let's get in touch
with our feelings"
wilderness crap.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.196
You understand me?

17:17.954 --> 17:20.832
You have to understand, this
is really important to Navid.

17:20.957 --> 17:23.334
Okay, The Blaze,
it's everything.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.836
And your life is
so interesting.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.380
(laughs)

17:27.505 --> 17:29.423
Why are you smiling
at me like that?

17:29.549 --> 17:31.676
Okay, Teddy,
Mmm.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.302
will you do it
for me? Please.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.514
Pretty please.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.098
Of course.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.475
(sighs)
Wasn't ever a question.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.768
I just enjoy

17:40.894 --> 17:42.311
watching beautiful girls beg.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.437
You're evil.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.605
Oh, come on.

17:44.731 --> 17:45.690
Don't act surprised.

17:45.815 --> 17:46.900
You of all people know me.

17:47.025 --> 17:47.775
Yeah, well,
I thought you might've

17:47.901 --> 17:49.694
grown up after a few years.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.362
What's the fun in that?

17:51.487 --> 17:52.363
(giggles)

17:52.488 --> 17:54.824
Although,

17:54.949 --> 17:56.951
rumor has it you've grown up.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.662
Whatever could you
be talking about?

17:59.787 --> 18:01.330
Come on, Ade.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.623
What's been going on?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.417
Hmm?
Mm, not much.

18:09.296 --> 18:11.591
Wow.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.301
That's intense, Ade.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.766
Was the baby Navid's?

18:21.809 --> 18:22.769
No.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.479
But he was really

18:25.605 --> 18:27.189
great through it.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.608
I mean, he actually wanted
to marry me

18:28.733 --> 18:30.526
and help raise her.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.654
It was a her.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.825
Um, but in the end,

18:37.951 --> 18:39.953
I just wasn't ready.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.204
What?

18:42.329 --> 18:44.331
Why do you look so serious?

18:44.457 --> 18:46.333
You're never serious.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.794
Are you okay now?

18:47.919 --> 18:49.796
Me? Yeah.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.213
I'm... good.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.382
I'm on track.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.218
Good.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.221

to me, you know?

19:00.890 --> 19:01.849
NAVID:
Hey.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.602
Hey.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.228
Hey, buddy.

19:06.353 --> 19:09.231
So it looks like I'm doing
my first interview.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.357
Yeah?

19:11.901 --> 19:13.736
Uh, yay.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.446
Uh, that's-that's great.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.698
Ah, Denny!

19:17.824 --> 19:19.700
Donny.
Right. Sorry.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.368
So listen, you were
going to show me

19:21.494 --> 19:23.370
how to send
an anonymous text.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.372
I'd love to.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.457
How about over dinner?

19:26.582 --> 19:27.625
Tonight?

19:27.750 --> 19:29.251
Um, I have plans.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.796
Lunch tomorrow?

19:31.921 --> 19:33.673

I gotta go edit, but I'll
meet you at 12:15, okay?

19:37.969 --> 19:38.803
Don't forget. I'll meet
you in the cafeteria?

19:38.928 --> 19:39.887
Oh, actually,

19:40.013 --> 19:41.388
the media lab.
Hi, Naomi.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.765
Bye, Naomi.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.600
Oh, he seems
stressed.

19:44.725 --> 19:45.726
It's The Blaze.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.021
He just wants it to be a success
so bad.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.439
He's even considering
doing a segment on that

19:50.564 --> 19:52.692
supposed text, sext,
that's going around.

19:54.485 --> 19:55.402
You've heard of it, right?

19:56.612 --> 19:57.655
Of Annie?

19:57.780 --> 19:58.906
Mmm. Yeah.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.658
He should run
the story.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.160
Come on, Naomi.

20:02.284 --> 20:05.163
Whatever Annie did,
she doesn't deserve that.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.247
I can't believe someone would
take a picture of it

20:07.373 --> 20:08.582
and send it around.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.459
How evil is that?

20:11.669 --> 20:12.461
Your ball.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.758
(groans, laughs)

20:18.801 --> 20:20.887
Come on, buddy.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.847

Where's your head at?

more than she likes you.

fact that you were kicked out

38:09.871 --> 38:12.040
Well, no.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.458
But maybe if I just
ask him again he'll...

38:13.583 --> 38:15.460
What?

38:15.585 --> 38:16.461
Nothing.

38:16.586 --> 38:17.629
What?

38:17.754 --> 38:18.755
Nothing!

38:18.880 --> 38:20.632
You're just...

38:20.757 --> 38:22.717
so sweet.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.510
So optimistic.

38:24.636 --> 38:26.263
I remember,

38:26.387 --> 38:29.808
before we all accepted
Daddy's affairs

38:29.933 --> 38:31.810
as par for the course,
there was this incident.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.145
Mommy had found some sort

38:33.270 --> 38:35.730
of proof that daddy
was sleeping

38:35.855 --> 38:36.898
with Florence Canold.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.901
But despite all the evidence,

38:40.026 --> 38:41.444
she didn't want to believe it.

38:41.569 --> 38:42.779
Everyone was talking

38:42.904 --> 38:45.031
about what a fool
our mother was.

38:45.157 --> 38:48.034
But as I grew up,

38:48.160 --> 38:51.037
I realized
she wasn't a fool.

38:51.163 --> 38:52.622
She was...

38:52.747 --> 38:54.624
just optimistic.

38:54.749 --> 38:55.875
Like you.

38:56.876 --> 38:59.296
In fact,

38:59.420 --> 39:02.799
every day you remind me more
and more of our mother.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.514
Naomi, what
are you doing?

39:09.639 --> 39:10.682
(sighs)

39:10.807 --> 39:12.100
I'm sending out that text.

39:12.225 --> 39:14.102
The evidence
was all there.

39:14.227 --> 39:16.980
I don't know
what I was thinking.

39:29.326 --> 39:32.037
GIRL:
Oh, my God, did you see
the principal's daughter naked?

39:32.162 --> 39:34.831
TEDDY (on TV):
I remember this one time
my father was doing a movie,

39:34.956 --> 39:36.833
when I was a kid.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.377
He was doing a movie
with Melanie Griffith and...
Nice rack.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.714
Annie, I'm here
for you, okay?

39:42.839 --> 39:43.882
Thank you.

39:44.007 --> 39:45.008
For-for warning me.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.843
I never thanked you
for warning me.

39:46.968 --> 39:48.678
It's okay.
No. No,
it's not okay.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.222
You were being nice
and a friend.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.390
I don't know why I never
even called you back

39:52.515 --> 39:54.142
when you called me
this summer and...
Annie.

39:54.267 --> 39:55.434
It's okay.

39:59.605 --> 40:01.691
It's going to be okay.

Hey.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.821
If it makes you
feel better,

40:06.946 --> 40:07.906
they've all seen
me naked, too.

40:08.031 --> 40:09.699
(laughs, sniffles)

40:11.117 --> 40:13.703
It's going to be okay?

40:13.828 --> 40:15.413
It's going to be okay.

40:16.706 --> 40:18.583
I just can't believe

40:18.708 --> 40:20.001
Naomi would do something
like this.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.460
Naomi?

40:21.586 --> 40:22.461
Yeah.

Look, I know you
think she's evil, but...

40:24.630 --> 40:25.924
I don't think. I know.

40:26.049 --> 40:27.884
She did it.
Think of all the awful

40:28.009 --> 40:28.927
things she's done to you.

40:29.052 --> 40:30.845
Yeah, but nothing like this.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.680
Well, lucky you.

40:32.805 --> 40:33.765
Annie,

40:33.890 --> 40:35.141
trust me, this...
Why?

I found what I thought
was a dead body back in June.

41:10.343 --> 41:12.637
That was pretty bad.

41:12.762 --> 41:14.973
It was my second day
back in L.A.,

41:18.768 --> 41:21.646
He was nearly dead
on the side of the road.

41:21.771 --> 41:23.481
Right on Mulholland.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.775
He'd been mowed over
