00:00.000 --> 00:04.104
GIRL:
 Previously on East Los High...

00:04.171 --> 00:05.572
I'm sorry about
what happened with Nick.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.574
It won't happen again.
Yes, it will.

00:07.641 --> 00:10.010
If not Nick,
then someone else.

00:10.077 --> 00:11.745
We need to talk.
You dropping me?

00:12.012 --> 00:14.414
JOCELYN:
 I broke things off with Nick.

00:14.481 --> 00:16.483
You promised me nothing
would change our friendship.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.252
Yeah, well,
I guess I lied.

00:18.318 --> 00:22.122
Just like you lie
all the time.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.692
MAN:
 And the winner is
the East Los High Bomb Squad!

00:25.759 --> 00:28.262
JACOB: Look out, ladies! Yes!
( girls cheering )

00:28.328 --> 00:30.164
( dramatic theme playing )

00:30.230 --> 00:32.332
I don't even talk to him.
What's this, perra?

00:32.399 --> 00:35.035
You're scaring me.
Come back here, you whore!

00:35.102 --> 00:38.338
PEDRO:
Open up the goddamn door!

00:38.405 --> 00:40.340
How'd you get away?

00:40.407 --> 00:42.476
Pedro was yelling so loud
the neighbors called the cops.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.077
Why didn't you call us?

00:44.144 --> 00:45.579
Me and Jacob
would've picked you up.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.182
Are you crazy?
It would've got us all killed.

00:48.248 --> 00:49.650
You know how jealous
he is of Jacob.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.252
Pedro's a dangerous asshole.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.688
You and Isela need
to stay the hell away from him.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.290
Why do you think
we're at a motel?

00:56.356 --> 00:58.125
Nobody treats me
like that.

00:58.192 --> 01:02.229
Well, I'm proud
you left, Ceci.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.530
That took a lot.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.999
I ain't no victim.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.467
( phone ringing )

01:07.534 --> 01:09.403
( sighs )

01:09.469 --> 01:11.004
Is that him?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.539
Yeah, he keeps
blowing up my cell,

01:12.606 --> 01:14.441
lying about how much
he loves me and shit.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.713
I'm going to show him
just how much he loves me.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.550
( camera shutter clicks )

01:23.617 --> 01:26.420
I swear I'm never going back
to that son of a bitch.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.358
( students chattering )

01:35.028 --> 01:36.430
What was that?

01:36.496 --> 01:38.599
What, you don't remember me
from last night?

01:38.665 --> 01:41.568
Oh, yeah. Just didn't recognize
you with your clothes on.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.538
Yo, how would you like
to go

01:44.605 --> 01:48.508
to New York, Venice and Paris
all in one night?

01:48.575 --> 01:50.143
I ain't dropping no acid.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.379
For reals. Remy's
sending me to Vegas tonight.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.747
You want to come?

01:54.014 --> 01:56.250
I can't.
It's a school night.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.719
Okay, who are you and
what have you done to Camila?

01:58.785 --> 02:01.688
( laughs ):
I got to take school serious

02:01.755 --> 02:03.357
if I want to be
a flight attendant.

02:03.423 --> 02:06.026
But it's Vegas.

02:06.093 --> 02:07.427
Can't it wait
till this weekend?

02:07.494 --> 02:10.297
Sure, I'll ask my boss.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.065
Yo, Remy.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.401
Hey, Camila and me
got a big test tonight.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.504
Yeah, you think the job
can wait till the weekend?

02:17.571 --> 02:19.473
Okay, cool.
He said, "Screw you."

02:19.539 --> 02:21.541
Ha, ha. Shut up.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.554
Should I add some, like,
cinnamon or something?

03:07.621 --> 03:11.325
Cinnamon?
It's a spell, not a flan.

03:11.391 --> 03:14.528
( sighs ):
 Now, when you stick
the photos together,

03:14.594 --> 03:18.265
you say,
"Your love will stick to me

03:18.332 --> 03:20.634
Like honey from a bee

03:20.701 --> 03:22.636
Our love will be sweet

03:22.703 --> 03:25.038
For all to see.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.007
Okay.

03:27.074 --> 03:30.310
And remember, when you put
the photos in the freezer,

03:30.377 --> 03:34.614
you have to chant,
"Love me, love me, love me"

03:34.681 --> 03:36.116
nine times in a row.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.451
( phone beeps )
( gasps )

03:37.517 --> 03:39.720
Oh, my God.
It's working.

03:39.786 --> 03:41.521
And don't forget to pay.

03:41.588 --> 03:46.727
I take VISA, MasterCard,
Discover, EBT, PayPal...

03:51.231 --> 03:53.600
You really worked up
my appetite.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.769
Finally, we're on a date
in public.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.638
I want everyone to see I got
the hottest girl in East Los.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.707
Then why are we
all the way in Burbank?

04:00.774 --> 04:04.010
Oh, 'cause it's one of my
family's favorite restaurants.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.146
We come here after church
all the time.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.647
Oh.

04:07.714 --> 04:11.318
So when do I
get to meet your family?

04:11.385 --> 04:13.453
Hey, can I try that?

04:13.520 --> 04:15.589
Sure.
Come and get it.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.524
( laughs )

04:22.329 --> 04:23.730
I'm glad we did this.

04:34.141 --> 04:37.144
I'm so sorry.
I won't hit you again.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.546
That's what you said
the last six times.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.681
That's bullshit. I would've
left him the first time.

04:41.748 --> 04:45.619
Actually, only 33% of teens who
are in a violent relationship

04:45.685 --> 04:47.788
even tell anyone
about the abuse.

04:48.054 --> 04:51.391
And Alma is here to tell us
some more about dating violence.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.726
Does anyone have
any questions?

04:55.429 --> 04:58.165
Hey, Zac, do you think
you need an acting class?

04:58.231 --> 05:00.434
( students laughing )

05:02.702 --> 05:04.571
I got a question.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.540
We're in high school.
What's this got to do with us?

05:06.606 --> 05:09.142
A lot, because
one in three teens

05:09.209 --> 05:10.777
are abused by the person
that they're dating.

05:11.044 --> 05:15.615
Every year, nearly 1.5 million
high school students

05:15.682 --> 05:18.018
are physically abused
by the person they're dating.

05:18.084 --> 05:20.320
Aw, hell, no. First dick
that lays a hand on me

05:20.387 --> 05:22.155
is gonna get the shit
kicked out of him.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.124
Yeah, and he's going
to kick you right back.

05:24.191 --> 05:27.127
That's how violence escalates.
That's what happened to me.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.162
I didn't listen to
any of the warning signs.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.530
Well, so why didn't you
just leave him

05:30.597 --> 05:32.232
the first time he hit you?

05:32.299 --> 05:34.401
Because I didn't think
I deserved any better.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.536
( school bell rings )
There are some fliers

05:36.603 --> 05:39.172
from loveisrespect.org
in the back.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.174
Make sure you grab one.

05:41.241 --> 05:44.644
BOY 1: Yeah.
BOY 2: That's my sister's story.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.680
( students chattering )

05:46.746 --> 05:48.582
Okay, thank you so much
for coming today.

05:48.648 --> 05:51.418
No, thank you. I really hope
I helped somebody.

05:55.755 --> 05:57.424
Joce.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.626
Hey, can I ask you
for a favor?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.728
Why don't you ask Nick?
I see you've run back to him.

06:01.795 --> 06:06.066
Ohh. Whatever. Can you cover
my shift tomorrow night?

06:06.132 --> 06:07.434
Why?

06:07.501 --> 06:10.203
Nick's taking me
to Vegas.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.039
Let me get this straight.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.508
You want me
to cover your shift

06:14.574 --> 06:16.743
so you can go to Vegas
and hook up with my brother?

06:17.010 --> 06:19.212
So is that a yes?

06:20.614 --> 06:22.015
You are a skank.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.585
Better than a lesbian.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.287
Who's a lesbian?
Shh!

06:27.354 --> 06:29.122
What?

06:29.189 --> 06:30.357
You guys are gay?

06:30.423 --> 06:32.492
I'm not.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.294
( dramatic theme playing )

06:36.496 --> 06:37.664
I am.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.300
Called it.

06:41.434 --> 06:42.602
I'm going to Vegas.

06:42.669 --> 06:45.272
Let's go.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.154
Jocelyn...

07:05.592 --> 07:08.461
I guess you heard.

07:08.528 --> 07:13.433
Coming out
takes a lot of courage.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.001
So now that you have--

07:15.068 --> 07:16.703
I'm not sorry I did it.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.505
And you shouldn't be.

07:18.572 --> 07:22.642
It's--It's okay
to be who you are.

07:22.709 --> 07:26.012
Right now
it feels really lonely.

07:28.582 --> 07:32.118
I, uh, felt that way too
when I came out.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.721
Really?

07:34.788 --> 07:38.491
You?
Yeah.

07:38.558 --> 07:42.095
And some people hated me.

07:42.162 --> 07:45.298
But the people
who mattered,

07:45.365 --> 07:47.033
they stood by me.

07:49.369 --> 07:52.105
I don't think
that's going to happen.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.307
You'd be surprised.

07:54.374 --> 07:57.210
I mean, at first, my family,
they struggled with it,

07:57.277 --> 08:00.013
but they came around.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.381
And if you need support,

08:01.448 --> 08:05.418
we have resources here
and in the community.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.654
Or you could talk privately
with our social worker,

08:07.721 --> 08:09.522
Ms. Gutierrez.
( sniffles )

08:09.589 --> 08:12.626
Why? There's nothing
wrong with me.

08:12.692 --> 08:15.528
I know that.

08:15.595 --> 08:20.600
But sometimes people
just don't understand,

08:20.667 --> 08:22.636
and they can be
hurtful.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.215
( sirens in distance )

08:36.783 --> 08:38.218
It's all right.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.286
( Latin pop music playing
over speakers )

08:42.122 --> 08:44.124
Where did Mommy put the key?
Hey...

08:44.190 --> 08:46.459
What's your name, love?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.261
Wanna party?

08:48.328 --> 08:50.664
You know I'm your neighbor.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.599
You want to get some affection?

08:52.666 --> 08:55.602
Maybe later?
Catch you out later.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.070
Hey, man.

08:57.137 --> 09:01.608
Yeah.
Nic's coming tonight.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.411
Yeah. Just call me
when he gets there.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.012
All right, later.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.081

09:09.716 --> 09:11.551
REMY:
All right,
let's hurry it up, boys.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.031

09:25.098 --> 09:27.233
What, he's never heard
of FedEx?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.335
We're getting a free trip
to Vegas.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.770
That's all I care about.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.440
No, something's up.

No. What I don't know
can't hurt me.

I don't want you
to play like that.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.751
Me and my brother,
we're out here for you.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.520
MAN 2: Open up, mija.
 MAN 1: Open up.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.522
MAN 1:
I'm telling you. Come here.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.724
MAN 2:
Don't worry. We'll take
real good care of you.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.093
MAN 1:
Okay, we'll be back.

11:09.402 --> 11:12.005
( knock on door )
MAN 1: Back for butt, bitch!

11:12.071 --> 11:14.274
( dramatic theme playing )

11:17.310 --> 11:19.312
( upbeat theme playing )

11:33.007 --> 11:34.208
Good morning.

11:34.275 --> 11:37.345
Hey.
Sleepyhead.

11:37.612 --> 11:38.880
Mm.

11:38.946 --> 11:41.582
( knock on door )
Morning.

11:41.649 --> 11:42.884
Who is it?

11:45.620 --> 11:46.821
Who's that?

11:46.888 --> 11:50.158
NICOLAS: Surprise.
MAN: Good morning.

11:51.726 --> 11:53.327
Miss.

11:53.594 --> 11:56.264
And where would you like
to have breakfast this morning?

11:56.330 --> 11:59.033
Um, in the room?

11:59.100 --> 12:00.301
( both laugh )

12:00.368 --> 12:03.638
That is why it is called
room service.

12:03.704 --> 12:05.640
NICOLAS:
My lady will have
breakfast in bed.

12:06.908 --> 12:09.177
As you say, sir.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.615
( laughs )

12:14.682 --> 12:17.919
Ah, I feel like Julia Roberts
in Pretty Woman.

12:17.985 --> 12:20.354
Only I'm not a hooker.

12:20.621 --> 12:21.956
Mm-hm.

12:23.724 --> 12:25.960
Thank you.
Thank you.

12:27.061 --> 12:28.262
Mm-hm.

12:33.334 --> 12:35.837
( door closes )
What now?

12:35.903 --> 12:37.171
Mmm.

12:37.238 --> 12:38.973
I took care of business
at Toxic,

12:39.040 --> 12:41.943
so all we have to do
is party it up now.

12:42.009 --> 12:43.778
( laughs )
Mm-hm.

12:47.281 --> 12:48.783
Ouch.

12:51.252 --> 12:52.887
What's this?

12:52.954 --> 12:54.188
Your earring?

12:54.255 --> 12:56.624
This isn't mine.

12:56.691 --> 12:57.925
Did you have another girl
in here?

12:57.992 --> 12:59.794
What? No.

12:59.861 --> 13:02.063
Then how did this get here?
It didn't just show up.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.365
Calm down.
Whose earring is this?

13:04.632 --> 13:06.934
How should I know?
It's your car.

13:07.001 --> 13:09.270
I can't believe you're lying.
There was another girl.

13:09.337 --> 13:12.907
Okay, calm down.
Okay, okay, fine.

13:12.974 --> 13:14.942
There was
another girl in here.

13:15.009 --> 13:16.911
Asshole.
No, baby, wait.

13:16.978 --> 13:18.980
Forget it.

13:19.046 --> 13:21.582
( door slams )
Damn.

13:21.649 --> 13:24.752
( crying )
Gina, wait, let me explain.

13:24.819 --> 13:27.822
There was another girl,
but not with me, with my dad.

13:27.889 --> 13:30.791
Your dad? What's your dad
doing in your car?

13:30.858 --> 13:32.627
Think about it.

13:36.731 --> 13:38.165
He's having an affair?

13:40.234 --> 13:41.869
Your parents have been
together forever.

13:41.936 --> 13:43.905
They seem so happy.

13:43.971 --> 13:46.774
My mom has no idea.

13:46.841 --> 13:48.109
It's killing me.

13:50.645 --> 13:52.947
And you've been keeping it in
this whole time?

13:54.649 --> 13:58.586
Yeah.
What can I do?

13:58.653 --> 14:00.087
He's my dad.

14:02.223 --> 14:04.292
Diego, I'm so sorry.

14:04.358 --> 14:05.960
It's okay.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.836
( knock on door )

14:22.176 --> 14:24.045
( knock on door )

14:35.723 --> 14:37.158
It's okay, baby.

14:39.293 --> 14:41.262
It's okay, baby.
We'll go home, okay?

14:41.329 --> 14:42.897
We're going home.

14:47.868 --> 14:50.605
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, okay?

14:50.671 --> 14:54.041
Get Isela and
let's go, baby, come on.

14:54.108 --> 14:55.643
MAYA:
 Are you kidding me?

14:55.710 --> 14:58.012
Why the hell would you
get back with Pedro?

14:58.079 --> 15:00.047
He's a good guy.

15:00.114 --> 15:02.183
Guys like that
don't change.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.619
Believe me,
I've been there. I know.

15:04.685 --> 15:06.721
He's just going through
a lot of shit right now at work.

15:06.787 --> 15:09.590
That's no excuse.
No, it's my fault too.

15:09.657 --> 15:11.258
I should've been there
for him.

15:11.325 --> 15:13.961
You should've seen him. He was
real sorry for what he did.

15:14.028 --> 15:15.229
Yeah, till
the next beating.

15:15.296 --> 15:17.031
Damn, Maya, why you acting
all superior

15:17.098 --> 15:18.733
like you and Jacob
never fight?

15:18.799 --> 15:20.101
Yeah, me and Jacob fight,

15:20.167 --> 15:22.770
but I don't end up
with bruises afterward.

15:22.837 --> 15:24.705
Why can't you
just be happy for me?

15:24.772 --> 15:26.107
Pedro's okay now.

15:26.173 --> 15:30.645
Ceci, I know
how this is going to end.

15:30.711 --> 15:32.713
You don't know shit.

15:32.780 --> 15:35.182
Dang.
What kind of friend are you?

15:35.249 --> 15:38.786
I open myself up to you,
and then you judge me?

Jocelyn's getting slammed.

16:17.692 --> 16:20.261
Ah, let's call her.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.329
Uh, I'm gonna go get
some water.

16:22.596 --> 16:26.033
WOMAN:
No, don't push me in the pool.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.968
Abuela.

16:28.035 --> 16:30.271
Nicky, thank god you called.

16:30.337 --> 16:33.007
Jocelyn has been crying
all day. And me too.

16:33.074 --> 16:36.110
I'm sorry, Nana.
 I wish I could be there.

16:36.177 --> 16:37.912
So is it true?

16:37.978 --> 16:40.047
Sabias?

16:40.114 --> 16:42.249
No, Jocelyn
didn't tell me anything.

16:42.316 --> 16:44.719
How'd you find out?
Did you talk to her?

16:44.785 --> 16:47.154
Luisa told me
at the store.

16:47.221 --> 16:49.957
Her daughter said
it's all over the school

16:50.024 --> 16:52.660
that Jocelyn is a lesbian.

16:52.727 --> 16:55.229
Que?
Jocelyn es lesbiana?

16:55.296 --> 16:58.933
I'll call you back.
I love you.

17:11.979 --> 17:13.948
( grunts )

17:22.957 --> 17:26.293
Someone say something,
please.

17:27.962 --> 17:30.931
What do you want us to say?

17:30.998 --> 17:33.267
That we're happy about this?

17:34.935 --> 17:37.071
Don't you want me
to be happy?

17:37.138 --> 17:38.773
( speaking in Spanish )

17:38.839 --> 17:40.207
We should have a party,

17:40.274 --> 17:42.710
because our granddaughter
is a marimacha,

17:42.777 --> 17:45.312
bringing shame
to our family.

17:45.379 --> 17:47.848
Jose, now, you know
you don't mean that.

17:47.915 --> 17:50.918
No, Rosario.

17:50.985 --> 17:53.053
Because
she's not like that.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.923
There are no homos
in my family.

17:58.058 --> 18:00.194
What about your cousin?

18:00.261 --> 18:02.062
Tio Hector?

18:02.129 --> 18:04.765
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

18:04.832 --> 18:07.234
Poor Hector
never found the right girl.

18:07.301 --> 18:09.236
Yes, he did.
Her name was Uncle Barry.

18:09.303 --> 18:11.005
They lived together
for 20 years.

18:11.071 --> 18:13.908
( speaking in Spanish )

18:13.974 --> 18:17.211
You are not
my granddaughter no more.

18:20.214 --> 18:22.650
Jose, you come back here.

18:24.718 --> 18:26.353
Ay, Jocelyn.

18:28.289 --> 18:30.157
Do you feel
that way too, Nana?

18:30.224 --> 18:31.692
Of course not.

18:31.759 --> 18:35.362
You will always be
our granddaughter.

18:35.629 --> 18:37.598
You just...

18:37.665 --> 18:39.266
You just need to give him
a little time

18:39.333 --> 18:44.071
to--to process and mourn.

18:44.138 --> 18:45.673
( sniffles )

18:45.739 --> 18:48.175
Mourn?

18:48.242 --> 18:50.044
I'm not dead.

18:52.613 --> 18:55.015
But his dreams for you are.

19:00.688 --> 19:01.989
And someday...

19:02.056 --> 19:06.193
Someday
he'll know that too, eh?

19:06.260 --> 19:09.930
It's gonna be okay,
Jocelyn.

19:12.933 --> 19:15.936
I'm sorry, Joce.
No, I...

19:16.003 --> 19:18.672
I'll talk to abuelo.

19:18.739 --> 19:20.040
I love you, okay?

19:20.107 --> 19:21.909
Camila's here.
You want to talk to her?

19:21.976 --> 19:26.247
JOCELYN ( on phone ):
 No, I really don't.

19:26.313 --> 19:27.882
Hey, Joce.
 Go to hell.

19:27.948 --> 19:29.950
( phone hangs up )

19:32.286 --> 19:34.188
Yeah, girl.

19:34.255 --> 19:37.324
I'm so sorry
we're not there.

19:37.591 --> 19:38.792
I hear you.

19:40.127 --> 19:42.930
Hey, don't trip
on the haters, man.

19:42.997 --> 19:45.032
Yeah, it'll be okay.

19:45.099 --> 19:47.134
Uh-huh.

19:47.201 --> 19:50.137
All right. Bye.

19:50.204 --> 19:52.840
( clears throat )

19:52.907 --> 19:54.375
She sounds bad, huh?

19:54.642 --> 19:57.912
Yeah, but she's strong.
She'll be okay.

20:02.082 --> 20:03.317
Did you know
she was gay?

20:04.952 --> 20:08.289
No. I had no idea.

To the new sales assistant
manager.

20:18.832 --> 20:20.701
Thanks, baby.

20:23.971 --> 20:28.042
I'm so proud of my man
working so hard for us.

20:28.108 --> 20:29.777
Know what we'll do
with that extra money?

20:29.843 --> 20:31.645
No, what?

20:31.712 --> 20:35.182
I want to legally adopt
Isela.

20:35.249 --> 20:37.885
You do?
Mm-hm.

20:37.952 --> 20:41.255
And work on giving her
a baby brother.

20:41.322 --> 20:43.891
Pedro, another baby?

20:43.958 --> 20:46.193
Yeah.

20:46.260 --> 20:48.829
I don't know what to say.

20:48.896 --> 20:51.265
Excuse me, waiter?
WAITER: Sir?

20:51.332 --> 20:52.933
Can we get another bottle
of champagne?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.368
WAITER: Of course.
Thank you so much.

20:54.635 --> 20:56.070
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Right away.

20:56.136 --> 20:58.739
Don't we? I already talked
to a lawyer friend.

20:58.806 --> 21:00.207
He said he could do
the whole thing for us.

21:00.274 --> 21:02.109
Just help us expedite it.

21:02.176 --> 21:03.777
Think about it.
How great would that be?

21:03.844 --> 21:05.913
She's like my daughter.
Just make it legal.

21:05.980 --> 21:08.215
And she'll have
my last name, of course.

21:08.282 --> 21:11.051
And we'll give her another
baby brother to play with.

21:11.118 --> 21:12.886
How much fun
would that be?

21:12.953 --> 21:15.622
It'd be our family.
It could be our family.

21:21.962 --> 21:23.263
Mm.

I love you so much.

We got to wear a condom.

No, baby.
I'm out of birth control.

We don't need that. Babe,
we don't need that anymore.

Baby, baby...

We don't need that, okay?

21:51.191 --> 21:52.926
