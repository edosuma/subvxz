00:00.467 --> 00:03.635
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:31.598 --> 00:34.533
Hmm, I think it might be...

00:34.535 --> 00:36.769
Yeah, huh! Look at that.

00:36.771 --> 00:38.670
Tomorrow's my birthday.

00:43.843 --> 00:46.412
Well, I just need to know,
should I plan something?

00:46.414 --> 00:48.213
Are people planning
something for me? Do...

00:48.215 --> 00:51.150
Do I need
to make myself scarce
for a few hours tomorrow

00:51.152 --> 00:52.818
while things get set up?

00:52.820 --> 00:54.887
Hey, that's actually
a good idea.

00:54.889 --> 00:58.457
You should definitely
leave for the entire day
tomorrow. (CHUCKLES)

00:58.459 --> 00:59.958
Well, just to make it easy
on everyone,

00:59.960 --> 01:02.995
I went ahead and made
my Amazon Wish List public.

01:02.997 --> 01:06.031
I also have a wish list
at Williams-Sonoma...

01:06.033 --> 01:07.232
Surprise!

01:07.234 --> 01:09.134
We're all going
to New York City, baby.

01:09.136 --> 01:10.436
(GASPS) Oh, my God.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.638
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
New York City?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.840
A trip to New York City
for my birthday.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.608
Oh! You shouldn't have.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.143
(GASPS) Are we going
to a show?

01:18.145 --> 01:19.445
(GASPS) Oh, my God!

01:19.447 --> 01:21.580
Did you get tickets
to <i> Kinky Boots?</i>

01:21.582 --> 01:24.249
Am I seeing <i> Kinky Boots</i>
for my birthday?

01:24.251 --> 01:26.018
(SCREAMS)

01:26.020 --> 01:28.587
Thank you, everyone!
This is the best
birthday present ever!

01:28.589 --> 01:29.688
Aaah!

01:29.690 --> 01:31.323
What are you talking about,
Marquess?

01:31.325 --> 01:32.591
We're going to New York City
for a mystery.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.893
-Oh.
-Why? When's your birthday?

01:34.895 --> 01:36.228
Tomor...

01:36.230 --> 01:37.796
Oh, okay.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.532
Sure, uh-huh, okay.
(CHUCKLES)

01:40.534 --> 01:42.234
I see what's going on.
I'll play along.

01:42.236 --> 01:45.537
So, I guess I should just
go pack for this "mystery"

01:45.539 --> 01:47.739
that's taking us
to New York City? (CHUCKLES)

01:47.741 --> 01:49.374
You guys probably
have a lot to talk about.

01:49.376 --> 01:50.642
The less I know, the better.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.512
(SQUEALS WITH DELIGHT)

01:53.514 --> 01:55.247
Did you guys know
it was his birthday?

01:55.249 --> 01:56.515
What are we gonna give him?

01:56.517 --> 01:59.118
I dunno.
I could give him gonorrhea.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.352
But, I'd have to (BLEEP) him.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.254
Hmm, I feel like
we can do better,

02:02.256 --> 02:03.655
but that's a good backup.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.757
Okay, read the mystery
to Pigeon, honey.

02:05.759 --> 02:09.561
"My name is Julie,
and I'm a production assistant
on <i> The Charlie Rose Show."</i>

02:09.563 --> 02:12.064
<i>The Charlie Rose Show</i>
is a talk show on PBS.

02:12.066 --> 02:15.367
"I need your help
because last night's guest,
Gregg Popovich,

02:15.369 --> 02:17.536
"has gone missing.
Please hurry."

02:17.538 --> 02:20.539
"Hurry" means "to move
or to proceed with haste."

02:20.541 --> 02:22.141
I know. What do you think,
I'm a (BLEEP) idiot?

02:22.143 --> 02:24.943
I don't know, don't birds
have small brains?

02:24.945 --> 02:26.678
How do you lose a guest
on a talk show?

02:26.680 --> 02:29.815
Uh, quick question
about "the mystery."

02:29.817 --> 02:32.084
If I were to schedule
a personal shopper
at Bergdorf's,

02:32.086 --> 02:35.154
are we thinking Saturday
is a day where we can all
do whatever we want?

02:35.156 --> 02:37.923
Or do you guys have everything
super planned? Or...

02:37.925 --> 02:39.525
You know what?
I'll just book it.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.627
And if I have to cancel it,
I'll cancel it.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.440
(BLEEP) you!
(BLEEP) all of you!

02:55.442 --> 02:57.409
Was it bad down there?

02:57.411 --> 02:59.711
Oh, where?
You mean in the freezing cold
with all the (BLEEP) luggage?

02:59.713 --> 03:01.113
We tried
to get you on, Pigeon,

03:01.115 --> 03:03.482
but they said
no animals in first class.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.450
You assholes
were in first class?

03:05.452 --> 03:06.818
Ugh! What is that smell?

03:06.820 --> 03:09.154
(BLEEP) That's my own (BLEEP).

03:09.156 --> 03:10.622

-What?

03:10.624 --> 03:12.791
Don't "ugh" me,
you (BLEEP) bitch.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.326
Where was I supposed to go?

03:14.328 --> 03:16.662
While you were
up there in first class
sipping champagne

03:16.664 --> 03:19.198
and shitting
wherever you pleased,

03:19.200 --> 03:23.902
I've been stuck
in a little plastic prison,
standing in my own feces.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.271
Just so you know,
we didn't have champagne.

03:26.273 --> 03:27.906
It was prosecco.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.374
And it wasn't even that good.
Halfway through the flight,

03:29.376 --> 03:31.410
I had to switch
to pinot, so...

03:31.412 --> 03:33.145
Ooh! There's our driver.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.880
(GASPS) Ah! You got us a limo?

03:34.882 --> 03:36.882
Oh, you guys are spoiling me!

03:36.884 --> 03:39.351
Yeah, where are you gonna
put me this time? The trunk?

03:39.353 --> 03:40.619
The glove compartment?

03:40.621 --> 03:43.488
Oh! Maybe in one
of the wheel wells.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.527
this is your first time doing

03:48.529 --> 03:49.795
Oh, I'm not gonna be
on the show.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.630
We're just here
to solve a mystery.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.765
Yeah, I've driven
Charlie Rose before.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.734
Nicest guy you'll ever meet.

03:55.736 --> 03:59.104
I drive a lot of celebrities.
Who do I get...

03:59.106 --> 04:02.574
I get Harrison Ford.
Drove him around.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.509
Him and his family.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.745
Took them all around town.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.547
Julianne Moore, stunning.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.983
She's a stunning woman.
Doesn't wear make-up.

04:10.985 --> 04:14.386
Doesn't need to make...
She doesn't need
to wear the make-up.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.821
She'll talk to you.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.456
DRIVER: I don't care
for the younger guys.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.993
They think the... You know.
They think the city's theirs.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.761
Just wanna go
to the titty bars.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.098
That's not what I wanna do,
wait outside a titty bar.

04:26.100 --> 04:29.701
(MUTTERING)
Four hours, sitting outside
of a titty bar. (SIGHS)

04:29.703 --> 04:31.937
You know who else?
Billy Crystal.

never rides in the back.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.076
Jesus Christ!

04:38.078 --> 04:41.747
Makes me harken back
to when I was standing
in my own (BLEEP).

04:42.649 --> 04:44.683
I should go see my daughter.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.385
She lives in the city.

04:46.387 --> 04:49.855
We weren't talking
for a while,
but now we're talking.

Bloomberg building.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.592
MARQUESS:
What are we doing here?

04:53.594 --> 04:55.327
It's where they tape
<i>The Charlie Rose Show.</i>

04:55.329 --> 04:57.429
So, this is an actual mystery?

04:57.431 --> 04:59.331
Yes, Gregg Popovich
is missing.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.133
Who is Gregg Popovich?

05:01.135 --> 05:02.367
He's a basketball coach.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.969
Oh, oh, right. I knew that.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.271
Oh, you knew that, really?
What team?

05:06.273 --> 05:09.741
Uh, the "I don't have to prove
anything because you're
a (BLEEP) asshole" team.

05:09.743 --> 05:10.876
-How about that?
-Yeah, well,

05:10.878 --> 05:12.377
he's the coach of the Lakers.

05:12.379 --> 05:13.912
-I know!
-Yeah.

05:13.914 --> 05:17.015
He's the coach of the Spurs,
you gay ghost! (LAUGHS)

05:17.017 --> 05:19.685
So... We're not seeing
<i>Kinky Boots?</i>

05:19.687 --> 05:21.787
We're not... Oh, Jesus.

05:23.556 --> 05:24.890
Oh, thank God, you're here.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.925
I'm Julie, I'm the one
who contacted you.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.393
Okay, we don't have much time.

05:28.395 --> 05:29.661
Good to meet you, Julie.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.730
We're the Mike Tyson
Mystery Team.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.999
That's Yung,
and that's Pigeon.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.967
And that's Marquess
over there.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.602
How could this have happened?

05:37.604 --> 05:39.037
I have one job.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.173
Take the guest from
the green room to the set,

05:41.175 --> 05:42.774
and then back
to the green room as soon as
the interview is over.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.876
PIGEON: (SCOFFS)
That's your (BLEEP) job?

05:44.878 --> 05:46.144
He could be anywhere.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.946
Let's split up.
I'll take Broadway.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.748
If he's not there,
I'll search Bergdorf's,

05:49.750 --> 05:51.950
Saks Fifth Avenue and Barneys.
Where else...

05:51.952 --> 05:54.886
I definitely need to go
to Mood, just to see it...

05:54.888 --> 05:56.855
No, he's still
somewhere in the building.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.458
You can't leave without
signing out, and I checked,
and he never did.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.259
-Just follow me.
-(SIGHS) Yeah.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.028
'Cause that's what
you wanna do in New York.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.596
You wanna go to a (BLEEP)
building and look for a man.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.466
Look for a man
in a (BLEEP) building.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.402
Gregg Popovich,
it has been my pleasure.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.871
Tomorrow night, our guest
will be Timothy Geithner,

06:12.873 --> 06:14.806
the former Treasury Secretary.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.975
Good night, everyone.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.777

06:20.947 --> 06:22.214
JULIE: It's like he took
two steps away,

06:22.216 --> 06:24.282
-and then he was gone.
-(TAPE STOPS)

06:24.284 --> 06:27.652
Maybe he got swallowed up
by all that darkness
behind the table.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.721
I mean, it's pitch black, man.

06:29.723 --> 06:33.024
What kinda cheap-ass
background is that
for a talk show?

06:33.026 --> 06:35.060
-Dad!
-I'm just saying, man.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.195
If Charlie Rose
wants to be successful,

06:37.197 --> 06:39.231
and if he wants to compete
with the Jay Lenos

06:39.233 --> 06:41.700
and the David Lettermans
of the world...

06:41.702 --> 06:43.668
They got rid of Leno,
it's Fallon.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.837
-And Letterman retired.
-Fallon?

06:45.839 --> 06:47.939
-Who's the other guy?
-I dunno.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.008
-Jimmy Kimmel.
-Uh-uh, uh-uh.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.277
Uh-uh, that's not the guy
I'm talking about.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.812
Who am I thinking of?

06:53.814 --> 06:55.414
How the (BLEEP) would I know
who you're thinking of!

06:55.416 --> 06:58.183
The one with the city
in the background, dickhead.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.619
-What?
-The dude that sits
at the desk,

07:00.621 --> 07:04.456
and behind him in the
background is a miniature
version of the city. That guy.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.525
Yes, yes, that's all of them.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.760
Exactly.
That's exactly my point.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.531
And that's why Charlie Rose
needs to get himself
to Home Depot

07:12.533 --> 07:15.667
and get some wood and build
a little New York City

07:15.669 --> 07:17.436
and put it in the
(BLEEP) background.

07:17.438 --> 07:20.372
And that is if he wants
to at least compete
with Jay Leno.

07:20.374 --> 07:22.707
Well, let's not forget about
Steve Allen.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.776
Oh, there you are.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.446
We're taping in 30 minutes.
We're gonna need you to get
Mr. Geithner to set.

07:27.448 --> 07:31.716
Oh, and um, we just got a call
from someone from the Spurs.

07:31.718 --> 07:34.319
They're looking for
Gregg Popovich. You have
any idea where he went?

07:34.321 --> 07:36.188
No! Uh...

07:36.190 --> 07:39.791
After the show, I took him
to the green room...

07:39.793 --> 07:41.426
Huh, weird.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.897
Uh-oh! Julie, you lied.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.999
That always makes
everything worse.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.634
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna get fired.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.002
I just know
I'm gonna get fired.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.737
Okay. Well, I'll just say it.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.372
This doesn't seem to be
one of those mysteries

07:54.374 --> 07:56.408
where we all need to be here,
you know what I mean?

07:56.410 --> 07:59.811
I mean,
I haven't spoken in a while,
and no one has noticed.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.380
So, what do we all think
of me just going,

08:02.382 --> 08:05.517
just to see about
tickets to <i> Kinky?</i>
And if there aren't any,

08:05.519 --> 08:10.422
I'll come right back
and keep looking
for, um... Uh...

08:10.424 --> 08:11.523
Oh, uh...

08:11.525 --> 08:14.359
-Gregg Popovich.
-Gregg Popovich.

08:14.361 --> 08:17.329
Yes. And you'll come
right back and help look.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.030
Oh! Right.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.699
And if there are
tickets available?

08:20.701 --> 08:23.802
You'll just see the show
and then come back
and help look, right?

08:23.804 --> 08:25.670
For a missing human being.

08:25.672 --> 08:29.508
A human being
who could be injured,
who could be scared, alone.

08:29.510 --> 08:32.744
Well, it's your birthday.
And so you, a grown man,

08:32.746 --> 08:35.947
you need to treat yourself
to a show of singing
and dancing?

08:35.949 --> 08:37.849
Okay, sounds good.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.586
This is a waste of time.

08:41.588 --> 08:43.855
We need to be
looking for him in places
I haven't already looked.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.858
Oh, I'm sorry. Are we the
"Julie Mystery Team"?

08:46.860 --> 08:49.461
Or are we the
"Mike Tyson Mystery Team"?

08:49.463 --> 08:50.962
Because last time I checked,

08:50.964 --> 08:54.299
this track suit, it said
"Mike Tyson Mystery Team."

08:54.301 --> 08:56.468
No, it doesn't.
It just has a question mark.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.103
What?

08:58.105 --> 09:00.205
(BLEEP) Deezy, the whole time
I thought this said

09:00.207 --> 09:02.274
the "Mike Tyson Mystery Team."

09:02.276 --> 09:04.509
Is my face
at least on the back?

09:04.511 --> 09:08.213
Somebody please tell me
my face is on the back
of this (BLEEP) track suit.

09:09.682 --> 09:11.316
Uh... Yes?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.051
Good, 'cause I was gonna
kick somebody's (BLEEP) ass

09:13.053 --> 09:14.953
if my face wasn't
on the back of this thing.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.055
(BLEEP) question mark, my ass.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.892
Makes me seem like
I'm just walking around like,
"I don't know, I don't know."

09:20.894 --> 09:22.494
Then he got up and went where?

09:22.496 --> 09:25.430
That's the thing.
He just vanished
into thin air.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.300
Julie, nobody just
vanishes into...

09:28.302 --> 09:30.702
Dad! Da...

09:30.704 --> 09:32.370
(ENERGY CRACKLING)

09:33.673 --> 09:35.974
-(DISTANT EXPLOSIONS)
-Where the (BLEEP) are we?

09:35.976 --> 09:39.144
CHARLIE ROSE:
A better question is
"When the (BLEEP) are we"?

09:39.146 --> 09:42.581
And the answer is
the year 2183.

09:42.583 --> 09:47.218
Also known as the year
humans become extinct.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.253
Go on.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.388
You see, once
artificial intelligence

09:50.390 --> 09:52.724
caught up with
human intelligence,

09:52.726 --> 09:54.693
the machines
declared war on us.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.395
And it is a war
they are winning.

09:57.397 --> 10:01.166
So, I went back in time
to find someone
to lead us to victory.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.868
After countless interviews,
I've found him.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.537
Gregg Popovich.

10:05.539 --> 10:08.506
That was the point
of <i> The Charlie Rose Show?</i>

10:08.508 --> 10:10.308
ROBOT: Kill all humans.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.376
(SHOTS BLASTING)

10:11.378 --> 10:12.911
(GROANS)

10:14.380 --> 10:15.814
Please...

10:15.816 --> 10:19.517
Promise me you'll carry on
in my place.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.020
I will, Charlie.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.022
You hear that, machine?

10:24.024 --> 10:25.991
I will! (VOICE ECHOING)

10:25.993 --> 10:29.961
Timothy Geithner,
it has been a pleasure.
Thank you for being with us.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.930
Oh, thank you for having me.

10:31.932 --> 10:35.934
I think that man wanted Mike
to take his place fighting
those machines.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.269
PIGEON: Yeah.
But he's doing all right.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.305
Hey, he fixed that background.

10:40.307 --> 10:44.409
Tomorrow night, our guest
will be <i> New York Times</i>
columnist, Paul Krugman.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.177
-Good night, everyone.
-(MUSIC PLAYING)

10:55.287 --> 10:58.223
And the cab driver
was trying to, um,

10:58.225 --> 11:00.325
elicit some kind of
dialogue from me,

11:00.327 --> 11:02.861
and this is what I do.
There's two things.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.262
"Shut the (BLEEP) up,"

11:04.264 --> 11:06.131
or "Hey, I don't feel like
talking right now,

11:06.133 --> 11:09.467
"my head is going through
some difficulties right now."

11:09.469 --> 11:10.969
That kind of stuff.
