WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:05.295
Hey. So we saw
a new billboard.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.589
Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

00:08.173 --> 00:10.843
What better way to announce
our new slightly lower prices

00:10.927 --> 00:12.845
than with an ad campaign?

00:12.929 --> 00:17.224
And what better face for an ad campaign
than our new regional manager?

00:17.475 --> 00:19.768
How'd it look?
You've seen it, right?

00:19.936 --> 00:22.271
No. Andy, somebody defaced it.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.857
What? How?

00:26.317 --> 00:27.317
Morning, Stanley

00:30.238 --> 00:33.866
There's this thing that people
tend to do with billboards

00:34.075 --> 00:35.743
How do I put this?

00:35.910 --> 00:42.374
If there's an opportunity for a graffiti
artist to work in a phallic shape

00:42.792 --> 00:45.919
interacting with the
artwork, it'll happen.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.631
And Andy gave them
that opportunity.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.884
Erin, how long did we order
those billboards for?

00:51.968 --> 00:53.761
Six months
Oh, God.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.429
I need you to call
the billboard company

00:55.513 --> 00:59.767
great billboard. Funny, edgy right up to
the line without crossing it. Loved it.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.518
Which one did you see?
Washington Street

01:01.519 --> 01:04.271
The one with like 20 dongs on it.
Okay. Don't be gross

01:04.647 --> 01:06.565
What's going on? Somebody
defaced the billboards

01:06.649 --> 01:09.318
we just put out
in an inappropriate way

01:09.736 --> 01:11.195
That's funny

01:13.323 --> 01:16.200
Wait, from the photo
shoot with you and me?

01:16.493 --> 01:17.618
Yeah, Dwight

01:17.744 --> 01:20.162
No. No

01:20.997 --> 01:29.505
No, no, no, no, no, no

01:29.964 --> 01:33.842
No, no, no, no, no. No

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.033 --> 01:58.992
Schrute Farms
is very easy to find.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.911
It's right in the middle of
the root vegetable district

02:00.995 --> 02:02.287
If the soil starts
to get acidic

02:02.372 --> 02:03.622
you've probably
gone too far.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.499
Just give us the address
we'll look it up online

02:05.583 --> 02:07.459
It's simpler this way.
It's really not

02:07.627 --> 02:10.211
Now stated arrival
time is 3:00 p.m.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.090
I don't get the reason for this party.
Yeah. What's the reason?

02:13.174 --> 02:15.175
What's the reason, Andy?
What's the reason?

02:15.343 --> 02:17.719
It's just a garden party Sheesh!

02:17.887 --> 02:19.972
You don't need a reason
to throw a garden party

02:20.056 --> 02:23.392
any more than you need a reason
to throw a birthday party

02:23.476 --> 02:26.395
It's a garden party
You don't need a reason

02:26.688 --> 02:29.398
A few other super simple reminders.
No burping, no slurping

02:29.482 --> 02:32.734
When eating, take small bites and chew
thoroughly with your mouth closed

02:32.944 --> 02:33.986
Yes, Darryl?

02:34.070 --> 02:35.529
What happens when
we're done chewing?

02:35.613 --> 02:38.907
Do we spit it out on the floor or keep
it in our mouths the rest of the time?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.826
I get it. I'm being
a little overbearing

02:40.910 --> 02:42.744
But I promise to be
under-bearing for a week

02:42.829 --> 02:45.581
if you guys just
all step it up.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.833
Andy, we understand basic table
manners We're not children.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.251
Yeah. It's just
a picnic

02:49.335 --> 02:52.337
This is not a picnic, Phyllis
It's a garden party.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.006
There's a grill in the
warehouse I could bring

02:54.090 --> 02:56.383
Oh, ew Please don't.
Not a barbecue

02:56.467 --> 03:00.470
It's better than a barbecue It's dignified.
Quieter. There are rules.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.722
How is that better
than a barbecue?

03:01.806 --> 03:04.308
What's the dress code for this?
I'm glad you asked

03:04.392 --> 03:05.517
Connecticut casual

03:05.602 --> 03:08.770
Any chance Connecticut casual
is Pennsylvania business?

03:08.855 --> 03:10.939
I.E., this is what
I'm wearing to your party

03:11.024 --> 03:14.484
guys, my family just threw a garden party
to celebrate my brother's promotion.

03:14.569 --> 03:15.986
It was a huge success

03:16.070 --> 03:17.487
Check it out.
There's a video online

03:18.281 --> 03:20.991
Heartwarming impromptu
father/son duet

03:21.117 --> 03:22.534
Oh, yeah

03:22.619 --> 03:23.952
Yeah. Oscar
you showed me this

03:24.037 --> 03:25.454
I've seen this.
That's not you

03:25.538 --> 03:26.997
Yeah. Who's the sausage?

03:27.081 --> 03:28.665
It's my dad
and my brother

03:28.750 --> 03:30.375
I would have joined in
but this melody

03:30.460 --> 03:33.712
doesn't really support
another harmony part, so

03:33.796 --> 03:35.088
Check it out
That's my brother's boss

03:35.173 --> 03:37.382
Look how psyched he is
He's having an awesome time

03:37.467 --> 03:38.508
Ah

03:38.593 --> 03:41.386
And did Robert California
get an invite to your party?

03:41.471 --> 03:44.514
Yeah, of course I mean,
yeah I think he did

03:45.475 --> 03:48.644
Why didn't you just say this was
to impress Robert California?

03:48.811 --> 03:53.690
I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a
party like this just to impress the CEO.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.692
Classic Gabe move

03:55.944 --> 03:58.779
Hey, Andy, how about you don't
steal my business strategies

03:58.863 --> 04:02.324
and I won't dress like my life
is just one long brunch

04:02.742 --> 04:05.494
See you all there at 3:00
p.m Connecticut casual

04:05.578 --> 04:07.746
Remember your manners
and have a wonderful time

04:07.830 --> 04:11.458
And please refer to the map
Stay off of the web.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.210
Thank you

04:13.461 --> 04:15.629
So, we've typed in
the address.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.880
Now let's take a look
at the street view

04:20.426 --> 04:23.512
They don't warn you when the
cameras are driving by Ah.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.223
Why do you keep reading
that garden party book?

04:26.307 --> 04:28.517
I mean, how hard are
finger sandwiches and tea?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.644
There's so much
more to it than that

04:30.728 --> 04:32.437
I've been wanting
Schrute Farms to break into

04:32.522 --> 04:34.606
the high-end event hosting
industry for some time,

04:34.691 --> 04:37.276
and this party is
a great opportunity

04:37.360 --> 04:39.653
Plus, I've got
a secret weapon

04:40.697 --> 04:42.572
Only one copy
in the world,

04:42.657 --> 04:46.034
and some sucker on the
Internet sold it to me for $2

04:48.663 --> 04:52.249
I'm actually really disappointed
in how poorly my book is doing.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.293
I've only sold one copy

04:55.420 --> 04:58.547
Is there anything you wish you'd
done differently to avoid cankles?

04:59.549 --> 05:00.549
Nope

05:00.633 --> 05:01.967
I've already gone up
another cup size.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.553
The senator
is grossed out

05:05.722 --> 05:07.514
When do you start
feeling it kick?

05:07.765 --> 05:11.226
Cece was around 22 weeks
but Philip was much earlier

05:11.561 --> 05:12.561
Philip?

05:13.229 --> 05:17.649
Oh, my gosh. Yes But don't
say anything, okay?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.151
It's after my grandfather

05:19.527 --> 05:21.403
Philip is the name
that we're using.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.946
It's after my favourite cat

05:23.031 --> 05:24.323
Oh, wow

05:24.407 --> 05:26.825
Funny. It's after
my grandfather.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.244
It's after my cat

05:29.329 --> 05:32.831
Andrew, I picked up two possible
gifts to bring this afternoon.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.583
One, a pot of marmalade.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.543
Ooh, that sounds great

05:36.627 --> 05:38.420
That is what you want then?
The marmalade?

05:38.588 --> 05:39.671
Sure

05:40.423 --> 05:43.967
You don't want to hearthe otherone.
You love marmalade?

05:44.635 --> 05:45.969
I'll hear the other one

05:46.179 --> 05:47.429
It's a basil plant.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.807
You know, the marmalade
sounds great.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.812
I also mentioned the marmalade to my
sister, and she's very interested.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.773
Then the basil will be fine

05:57.857 --> 05:59.066
Well, you clearly want
the marmalade.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.277
Gretchen, I need
another marmalade.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.904
All right.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.289
Hey, where do I park?
I'm the valet.

06:14.415 --> 06:17.000
You have to give me your car, I'm parking.
I can probably park it myself

06:17.085 --> 06:18.543
I'm the valet. You have
to give me your car.

06:18.628 --> 06:19.920
It's probably okay
that I park...

06:20.004 --> 06:22.005
No. I think it's
probably better that I

06:22.090 --> 06:23.673
I'm the valet.
You have to give me

06:23.800 --> 06:27.135
It's a finicky car Get out of your car.
Get out.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.849
Have a good time
at the thing.

06:32.975 --> 06:35.644
It's a little tricky.
You might want to

06:55.331 --> 06:57.624
Mr. Ryan Howard

06:57.792 --> 07:00.377
"Chapter Two. Announcing
guests as they enter

07:00.461 --> 07:02.087
"is the height of decorum

07:02.171 --> 07:06.883
"The more volume displayed the more honour
is bestowed upon everyone present."

07:07.343 --> 07:11.179
Stanley Hudson
and his mistress Cynthia

07:13.057 --> 07:17.853
James, Pamela
and Peepee Halpert

07:20.690 --> 07:22.524
How's it going over here, guys?
Andy, stop hovering

07:22.608 --> 07:23.608
You're being
really annoying

07:23.693 --> 07:25.193
Didn't mean
to bother you, Mable

07:26.529 --> 07:28.113
"Mable, Mable
if you're able,

07:28.197 --> 07:30.699
"keep your elbows
off the table." Wow

07:30.783 --> 07:35.036
Mr. and Mrs. Walter
and Ellen Bernard

07:37.248 --> 07:39.291
So you all work
with Andy?

07:40.042 --> 07:43.712
Well, technically, for Andy

07:43.796 --> 07:47.090
Technically for Robert
California He's our CEO.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.469
I thought you
were the CEO

07:50.553 --> 07:51.636
I don't know how
you got there

07:51.721 --> 07:53.430
You said you were
running the company

07:53.514 --> 07:55.557
This branch
I'm the regional manager

07:55.641 --> 07:57.726
Yes. Well, that makes
more sense.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.061
Are you a
regional managers?

08:00.730 --> 08:04.441
Did I throw this party to impress
my parents? That's crazy

08:05.067 --> 08:07.694
No, if they wanted a garden party,
they could throw one themselves.

08:07.778 --> 08:09.821
Which, as a matter of fact,
they did last week.

08:09.906 --> 08:13.742
They threw one for my baby brother,
and it was totally amazing.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.911
But I couldn't care less.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.914
Can I introduce
you around now?

08:19.540 --> 08:22.667
Yeah, we don't have too long
We have theatre tickets.

08:22.752 --> 08:23.877
What are you
going to see?

08:24.253 --> 08:25.253
Moneyball.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.257
It was
Walter Jr.'s choice

08:29.342 --> 08:30.592
MRS. BERNARD There he is. What?

08:30.676 --> 08:31.927
Bro-nard

08:32.428 --> 08:34.011
I didn't know you were
going to be here

08:34.096 --> 08:35.597
I wouldn't have missed it

08:36.265 --> 08:37.599
Okay

08:40.520 --> 08:41.602
Ahh

08:41.687 --> 08:43.522
I'm Walter. I'm Andy's
younger brother

08:43.606 --> 08:45.232
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Jim.

08:46.484 --> 08:51.738
Tuna, right? And this must
be your lovely wife, Pam

08:51.822 --> 08:52.822
No
Hell no

08:52.949 --> 08:56.451
She wishes. No, no, no no, no.
No

08:56.953 --> 09:00.539
Sir, I need to be able to feed
all the guests I understand

09:00.623 --> 09:01.957
Excuse me

09:05.795 --> 09:07.128
Set that down

09:12.635 --> 09:14.135
Present yourself

09:33.656 --> 09:37.158
"Chapter Four One of the
host's most important duties

09:37.243 --> 09:38.827
"is as dance master.

09:39.287 --> 09:43.415
"A proper courtly dance sets the
tone for the entire afternoon."

09:56.846 --> 10:00.140
Ladies and gentlemen
may I present

10:00.224 --> 10:04.811
Robert California

10:09.233 --> 10:10.358
Hello, Andy
Welcome

10:10.443 --> 10:12.193
Thank you
Hey, I want you to meet

10:12.278 --> 10:15.280
my first bosses
Mom and Dad

10:15.406 --> 10:17.198
Yes. Hello. Nice to
meet you Pleasure.

10:18.242 --> 10:21.036
Andy, where shall I put
your basil plant?

10:21.203 --> 10:23.288
I thought you were going
to bring the marmalade?

10:23.372 --> 10:26.041
No. I'm certain
you said basil.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.963
This is not funny, man
Let me down.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.884
I think this thing is broken. It's not
broken, Kevin This is how it works.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.889
It's so pretty today

10:41.474 --> 10:42.807
It's getting chilly

10:42.892 --> 10:45.101
Yeah. We really
should be leaving

10:45.519 --> 10:46.519
Yeah. Um

10:46.604 --> 10:49.606
It'll be weird if the boss-man
didn't make a toast, so hang on.

10:50.358 --> 10:54.486
Everybody, I just want to take this
opportunity to thank you all for coming

10:54.570 --> 10:59.115
and to raise a glass
to my amazing staff

11:00.284 --> 11:01.951
Toasts are great.
I mean, you toast somebody

11:02.036 --> 11:04.454
they toast you back
It just goes round and round

11:04.538 --> 11:07.582
That's my favourite part
about toasts, the reciprocity

11:07.667 --> 11:10.085
Let's hear from you guys.
Who do you want to toast?

11:10.169 --> 11:11.169
Yeah, I'll say something

11:12.546 --> 11:15.173
I think we should be
acknowledging our boss

11:15.257 --> 11:17.425
because none of us
would be here without him

11:17.802 --> 11:18.927
Robert California

11:19.261 --> 11:21.012
To Robert
- Yay, Robert

11:23.599 --> 11:27.435
I cannot believe I didn't think of
toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel

11:27.520 --> 11:29.688
Why are you talking
to Stanley's mistress?

11:29.772 --> 11:32.649
I would like to toast
someone who isn't here

11:32.733 --> 11:34.984
but who will be
in just four short months

11:35.611 --> 11:39.155
Welcome to the world
Philip Lipton.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.448
Aww

11:41.951 --> 11:47.205
I also would like
to toast Philip Halpert

11:47.289 --> 11:48.915
who's due even sooner

11:49.125 --> 11:52.460
May he be a good namesake
to my grandfather

11:52.545 --> 11:57.465
who I promised as a child
long before tonight,

11:57.550 --> 12:00.468
that I would one day
name my son after him

12:01.387 --> 12:03.638
To Philip Halpert.
To Philip

12:03.723 --> 12:04.723
All right

12:04.974 --> 12:08.309
She just always has
to copy anything I do

12:08.811 --> 12:11.855
It's the Ford Taurus
situation all over again

12:12.064 --> 12:14.524
I'd like to make
a toast to the troops

12:14.608 --> 12:15.650
Here, here
Yes

12:15.776 --> 12:18.445
All the troops
Both sides

12:20.781 --> 12:22.073
I think
we should toast

12:22.158 --> 12:25.160
Ladies and gentlemen
the Last Supper.

12:29.665 --> 12:33.752
"Chapter Nine The tableau
vivant is not only welcome

12:33.836 --> 12:37.630
"but expected entertainment
at any garden party."

12:38.799 --> 12:39.883
Andy?

12:40.176 --> 12:42.594
I think that we should
acknowledge the man

12:42.678 --> 12:45.180
who has led us to such
a profitable quarter.

12:46.348 --> 12:49.184
To Robert California
Yeah

12:49.852 --> 12:53.396
I would also like to toast Robert
California Mr. California...

12:53.481 --> 12:55.815
You can't triple
toast somebody

12:56.734 --> 12:58.860
At least not until
we hit everyone once

12:58.944 --> 13:01.780
I'll say a few words if that's
all right with you, Andy

13:02.448 --> 13:03.531
Yeah

13:05.826 --> 13:10.038
You people say I led you
but it wasn't me

13:11.373 --> 13:15.335
You want to toast the man
who led you to success,

13:15.419 --> 13:17.295
but the boss is irrelevant

13:18.339 --> 13:21.132
Andy and I produce
nothing We do nothing

13:21.884 --> 13:24.385
We sit in our offices
and demand,

13:24.470 --> 13:28.807
"I want this and that right
now" like petulant children

13:29.183 --> 13:33.019
You know the difference between
a crying baby and a manager?

13:33.229 --> 13:34.771
One day the baby
will grow up.

13:38.067 --> 13:43.488
But without you, Andy and I would
be sitting in our dirty diapers

13:43.572 --> 13:46.407
waiting for someone
to change us, wipe us

13:46.742 --> 13:49.702
I should be toasting you
thanking you,

13:49.787 --> 13:53.998
for allowing me to have the
easiest job in the universe.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.209
Cheers
- Cheers

13:56.836 --> 13:58.419
To Robert California

13:58.671 --> 14:00.964
From the moment you entered our
building and our hearts, you...

14:01.048 --> 14:05.885
Some of you know that we have
an Internet star in our midst.

14:06.554 --> 14:10.431
Mr. Walter Banes Bernard, Sir
please report to the stage.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.267
I'm eating, Andy

14:13.018 --> 14:14.185
Come on

14:15.771 --> 14:17.647
Okay. All right

14:18.023 --> 14:19.065
Okay

14:19.567 --> 14:20.900
Yes Yeah, what do
you want to do?

14:20.985 --> 14:24.362
Well, how about one of our
classic father/son duets?

14:24.446 --> 14:26.364
Oh, whoa.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.490
You sure?

14:27.575 --> 14:30.076
Really?
It's a little tricky

14:34.707 --> 14:39.502
Saying I love you
Is not the words

14:39.628 --> 14:41.713
It's too high. It's high but
it's not that high. Really?

14:41.797 --> 14:44.007
Right. It feels strained
Yeah. Just take it down.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.094
Saying I love...

14:48.178 --> 14:49.929
Saying I love you

14:50.055 --> 14:52.223
Here. Just give it to me.
Yeah Yeah

14:52.308 --> 14:53.433
Okay

14:55.895 --> 14:57.520
Something like

14:58.480 --> 15:02.734
Saying I love you
is not the word...

15:02.818 --> 15:03.860
You don't come in yet

15:03.944 --> 15:06.571
...I want to hear from you

15:06.655 --> 15:09.908
It's not that I want you

15:09.992 --> 15:14.537
Not to say
but if you only knew

15:14.830 --> 15:17.540
More than words

15:17.625 --> 15:22.295
Is all you have to do
to make it real

15:22.379 --> 15:25.798
Is anyone filming this?
Seriously. Erin!

15:26.008 --> 15:28.259
It's either taping
or calling.

15:29.219 --> 15:32.764
What would you do

15:32.848 --> 15:36.184
If my heart was torn in two

15:36.268 --> 15:38.686
You know what?
Walter Jr. is here

15:38.771 --> 15:40.271
Why don't you come up and join us?
- Yeah, no

15:40.356 --> 15:42.023
No, come up and do something with me.
I don't know, Pop

15:42.107 --> 15:44.108
I'm just having a good time getting
to know Andy's friends here

15:44.193 --> 15:45.401
Get up there and sing

15:45.486 --> 15:48.321
or I will cut your larynx and
you'll never be able to sing again

15:48.405 --> 15:50.031
Whoo! Come on

15:51.200 --> 15:52.825
Come on
Give them what they want

15:52.910 --> 15:55.745
All right. This old thing
I don't even

15:56.538 --> 16:01.501
May the good Lord be with you
Down every road you roam

16:03.796 --> 16:09.092
And may sunshine and happiness
Surround you when you're far from home

16:11.095 --> 16:16.182
And may you grow to be proud
Dignified and true

16:18.143 --> 16:22.981
And do unto others
As you'd have done to you

16:24.108 --> 16:26.776
Cheers! All right

16:27.820 --> 16:30.655
What's going on? Cheers, cheers.
Get your own guitar

16:37.746 --> 16:40.123
Sorry. Please hang
up and try again.

17:08.318 --> 17:11.445
I am so cold It's because
you didn't bring a jacket

17:11.821 --> 17:15.157
My first love is beet farming,
but it's a young man's game

17:15.284 --> 17:18.828
Whoever heard of an old beet farmer?
Forget the beets.

17:18.912 --> 17:21.079
Concentrate on the hosting

17:21.832 --> 17:26.252
I can spend a considerable amount of
money having my birthday party here

17:26.336 --> 17:28.796
Really? We have a number
of birthday packages

17:29.048 --> 17:31.549
The Pewter package has the
least amount of goats.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.135
It's not no goats
it's still 10 to 12 goats

17:34.219 --> 17:35.595
depending on the
availability of the goats

17:35.804 --> 17:38.931
Now the goat package, obviously, has
the most goats What were you thinking?

17:40.976 --> 17:43.061
Of course I am not
interested in goats

17:43.145 --> 17:46.230
Why would you spend so much time
going over the goats with me?

17:47.941 --> 17:50.026
I can get you
exotic meats

17:50.652 --> 17:53.196
Hippo steaks.
Giraffe burgers

17:54.323 --> 17:55.406
We'll talk

17:59.328 --> 18:00.953
It'll all be goat

18:01.914 --> 18:05.208
Hello, Cece Halpert
This is Andrew Bernard

18:05.292 --> 18:09.087
I'd very much like to speak with
you about your paper supply needs

18:12.007 --> 18:13.883
That wasn't even
my worst sales call

18:15.469 --> 18:16.511
Hi

18:19.515 --> 18:21.474
What was that display?

18:23.018 --> 18:25.686
I don't know.
I just thought

18:25.771 --> 18:28.231
if I could throw
this great garden party

18:28.315 --> 18:32.026
and show you how respected I
am that you'd be proud of me

18:33.153 --> 18:34.320
Andrew
I know

18:34.404 --> 18:36.322
I know that you're
proud of me.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.449
I'm not going to tell you
how impressed I am

18:38.534 --> 18:42.787
that you're a manager
of some rinky-dink branch

18:42.871 --> 18:45.790
of a paper company
in Scranton, Pennsylvania

18:46.041 --> 18:48.835
How long are you going to
go on needing my approval?

18:49.628 --> 18:52.713
You're a grown man. Don't act
like a little boy who needs...

18:54.550 --> 18:55.675
I think if I had
parents like that,

18:55.759 --> 18:59.011
I'd be trying to convince everyone
all the time how great I was, too

18:59.138 --> 19:01.556
Guess we found Andy's
Rosebud Rosebud?

19:01.640 --> 19:02.974
It's a reference
to Citizen Kane.

19:03.058 --> 19:06.185
Something that explains why a
person became the way they are.

19:06.270 --> 19:10.565
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't
explain why he was how he was

19:11.233 --> 19:14.277
It just represented what was important
to him as a child, that he missed.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.154
Different school of thought.
Let's just agree to disagree

19:16.238 --> 19:17.905
No. You're wrong

19:18.907 --> 19:21.868
Are you sure?
Yeah. I'm too hot anyway

19:21.952 --> 19:25.246
My body has somehow become
acclimated to southern Italy

19:25.330 --> 19:26.581
Isn't that strange?
I've never been there

19:28.208 --> 19:30.001
Oh! Ah. Well

19:30.085 --> 19:31.294
Yes, that's nice

19:31.378 --> 19:32.712
Thank you

19:34.756 --> 19:39.760
It was a nice party. The setting
was a little strange. The food

19:39.845 --> 19:41.095
Sandwiches were dry

19:41.180 --> 19:42.847
Bye, Tuna
Bye, Pam

19:52.107 --> 19:54.066
Hey, everybody
I'm going to leave

19:54.902 --> 19:57.278
and I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry

19:57.446 --> 19:59.197
Cheeseburger
or hamburger?

20:02.242 --> 20:03.242
Um

20:04.953 --> 20:05.953
Cheeseburger

20:06.288 --> 20:07.330
Nard-Dog

20:10.792 --> 20:11.792
Thanks, Oscar

20:29.603 --> 20:31.229
What are they doing?

20:31.313 --> 20:33.022
Closing ceremonies

20:33.815 --> 20:35.149
Nice touch

20:52.834 --> 20:55.920
I think I left my wallet in your house.
Who cares?

20:56.004 --> 20:59.048
Right here
Mr. James Halpert

20:59.132 --> 21:00.341
Keys. My keys

21:00.467 --> 21:03.177
Stop forgetting things. I didn't
forget them They're right here.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.472
Mr. James Halpert

21:08.308 --> 21:10.059
I'm so sorry.
I think I forgot the

21:10.143 --> 21:11.644
What
You idiot

21:13.313 --> 21:14.897
Ooh
Mis...

21:16.942 --> 21:17.942
Mi.

21:18.026 --> 21:20.111
What are you doing?
Hey, I have a question

21:20.195 --> 21:23.406
Who do you think is really the
best salesman in this office?

21:23.490 --> 21:27.201
Stupid question, obviously
Mr. James Halpert!
