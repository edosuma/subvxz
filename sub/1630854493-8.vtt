00:06.379 --> 00:08.758
<i>Forecast for Haines...</i>

00:08.758 --> 00:11.206
<i>has been upgraded
to a warning.</i>

00:11.206 --> 00:14.034
<i>Excessive run off may result
in flooding of rivers,</i>

00:14.034 --> 00:15.655
<i>creeks, streams.</i>

00:16.827 --> 00:18.241
<i>Be prepared to take action.</i>

00:18.827 --> 00:19.931
<i>We got a...</i>

00:21.103 --> 00:22.724
some people would say
a winter storm,

00:22.724 --> 00:24.758
but in Alaska, we just say,

00:24.758 --> 00:26.655
a storm coming through.

00:27.758 --> 00:30.241
And it's predicted
to be a big one.

00:33.448 --> 00:37.000
Hey, fellas,
we have a weather forecast,
it's something awful.

00:38.482 --> 00:40.344
Let's tie everything off.

00:40.344 --> 00:43.137
Basically, if you think
it can go downstream,

00:43.137 --> 00:44.586
or get knocked over,

00:44.586 --> 00:46.344
tie it off. All right?

00:46.344 --> 00:47.689
I don't know
what's about to happen

00:47.689 --> 00:49.862
-'cause we don't know
what this creek does.
- No.

00:49.862 --> 00:52.620
It can be up to here if...
I don't know.

00:52.620 --> 00:53.827
<i>We're gonna
have to pull back.</i>

00:53.827 --> 00:54.793
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:54.793 --> 00:56.310
<i>We have to make it
back to town.</i>

00:57.724 --> 01:00.965
<i>Nugget Creek,
southeast Alaska,</i>

01:00.965 --> 01:03.379
<i>almost halfway
through his season</i>

01:03.379 --> 01:07.103
<i>and Dustin Hurt could be
just days away from finding</i>

01:07.103 --> 01:08.862
<i>a monster pile of gold.</i>

01:10.758 --> 01:13.793
Gold is great,
your life is more.

01:13.793 --> 01:15.931
- Let's do a cleanout.
- Copy that.

01:15.931 --> 01:18.448
<i>But inbound
severe weather</i>

01:18.448 --> 01:20.620
<i>forces him to evacuate
his crew</i>

01:21.310 --> 01:23.448
<i>35 miles back to Haines.</i>

01:24.862 --> 01:27.000
Yeah!
That's what I want.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.275
Here's fingers crossed.

01:29.896 --> 01:31.793
That we're gonna have a site
when we come back.

01:33.965 --> 01:36.482
All right. Let's not
wait for this water
to come up on us.

01:36.482 --> 01:38.620
Let's get out of here
and go do a cleanup.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.724
Let's see
what's in this concentrate.

01:57.586 --> 01:59.103
That's gold right there.

01:59.103 --> 02:01.448
Is that gold?

02:01.448 --> 02:04.034
Okay, man!
That's awesome, man.

02:04.034 --> 02:06.137
That's a pretty good old
piece though, right there.

02:08.206 --> 02:09.758
It's gonna happen.

02:09.758 --> 02:12.379
Still got plenty of dirt
to go through.

02:12.379 --> 02:13.931
And there's another one.

02:13.931 --> 02:16.241
Yeah!

02:16.241 --> 02:17.241
Wow!

02:17.241 --> 02:19.482
awesome, guys.
I mean...

02:19.482 --> 02:21.206
It's been a long time
getting to this point.

02:21.206 --> 02:22.931
We don't have to
wonder if there's gold

02:22.931 --> 02:24.310
- down there anymore.
- No.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.551
- This is gonna work.
- All right, man.

02:25.551 --> 02:27.379
We got
a good clean, dude.

02:27.379 --> 02:29.931
- Finally right?
- Yeah.

02:29.931 --> 02:32.517
All that other stuff,
apparently, was practice.

02:32.517 --> 02:34.689
Now, it's time to get
some real gold.

02:34.689 --> 02:36.482
The reason why they
call it Nugget Creek.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.482
Hopefully, this is gonna get
better and better.

02:45.137 --> 02:46.517
<i>There's a storm
coming in.</i>

02:49.758 --> 02:51.034
<i>But it's okay.</i>

02:51.034 --> 02:53.000
<i>We picked the right spot
for the first time.</i>

02:54.000 --> 02:56.034
<i>Finally, this is happening
for us.</i>

02:56.034 --> 02:58.620
I'm talking about
gold, gold, gold!

02:58.620 --> 02:59.896
<i>Now,
give us the gold.</i>

03:15.034 --> 03:17.758
Yeah, this boulder
is huge.

03:17.758 --> 03:19.620
Dangerous. Dangerous as hell.

03:19.620 --> 03:21.310
<i>You die,
it's not my fault.</i>

03:23.551 --> 03:25.793
I'm
stuck already.

03:25.793 --> 03:28.172
Whenever it feels like
we're making progress,

03:28.172 --> 03:29.413
<i>something sets us back.</i>

03:32.655 --> 03:34.896
Body is failing,
mind is failing...

03:34.896 --> 03:37.206
- Why are you so mad?
-'Cause I'm trying to help.

03:37.206 --> 03:38.896
You just come over
and took over
what I was doing.

03:46.103 --> 03:48.172
- Scott, look at this.
- That's clay.

03:48.172 --> 03:50.724
That lock in gold like
vice, wouldn't it?

03:50.724 --> 03:53.172
This makes me
wonder if we're close
to bedrock.

03:53.172 --> 03:55.137
I saw a couple
of little flakes.

03:55.137 --> 03:56.137
That's awesome.

03:56.137 --> 03:57.586
This is gonna be
a game changer.

04:06.482 --> 04:08.551
<i>With 36 hours straight,</i>

04:08.551 --> 04:12.344
<i>heavy rain and strong winds
pound southeast Alaska.</i>

04:33.620 --> 04:36.344
Storm just came through,
had to pull both crews out

04:36.344 --> 04:39.068
for 24 hours for safety.

04:39.068 --> 04:42.482
It's too bad, too because
we just started seeing gold

04:42.482 --> 04:43.862
and some good cleanups.

04:43.862 --> 04:46.655
But we gotta get
back out there,

04:47.275 --> 04:48.068
find out...

04:49.137 --> 04:51.482
what got destroyed
and what it's gonna take

04:51.482 --> 04:52.689
to fix everything up.

04:54.172 --> 04:56.482
<i>After gambling
his entire savings</i>

04:56.482 --> 04:58.655
<i>on his new Nugget Creek claim,</i>

04:58.655 --> 05:01.000
<i>Dustin is finally on the gold.</i>

05:02.068 --> 05:04.344
<i>But the merciless
Alaskan weather</i>

05:04.344 --> 05:05.724
<i>threatens to bankrupt him.</i>

05:07.034 --> 05:10.034
We're just gonna
have to dig and dig

05:10.034 --> 05:11.965
until winter hits.

05:11.965 --> 05:14.620
<i>The airboat I have is the only
way up to Nugget Creek.</i>

05:14.620 --> 05:17.034
We need as much fuel
as we can get up here.

05:17.034 --> 05:19.793
So, I went ahead and got
ahold of another airboat.

05:23.275 --> 05:26.896
<i>The more fuel
Dustin can boat in today,</i>

05:26.896 --> 05:30.137
<i>the longer they
will be able to
run the dredges uninterrupted.</i>

05:36.000 --> 05:37.655
<i>Today,
I'm taking another airboat.</i>

05:37.655 --> 05:39.620
It's different than the one
Dustin has been driving.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.103
It has an actual
aircraft engine,

05:41.103 --> 05:43.965
<i>so it's a boat
that was, basically,
pieced together.</i>

05:47.172 --> 05:48.344
- Think it's going to work?
- Yes.

05:48.344 --> 05:49.172
Okay.

05:50.103 --> 05:51.896
All right. Can you
pull your boat up?

05:51.896 --> 05:53.689
Got another barrel
to put in here.

05:53.689 --> 05:54.965
Going for broke.

05:54.965 --> 05:56.758
<i>Right now,
we're attempting to bring</i>

05:56.758 --> 05:58.275
<i>more fuel than we've
ever brought.</i>

06:01.034 --> 06:02.827
<i>Between the two boats,</i>

06:02.827 --> 06:04.931
<i>Dustin's hauling in
five barrels.</i>

06:07.413 --> 06:09.448
<i>It's perfect
conditions for this test run.</i>

06:10.862 --> 06:12.931
Scott, you're gonna
be able to drive that thing
or what?

06:13.896 --> 06:15.000
Yes.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.068
You die,
it's not my fault.

06:17.068 --> 06:21.206
<i>Marine veteran,
Scott, has volunteered
for the mission.</i>

06:21.206 --> 06:23.344
<i>But he's never operated
an airboat.</i>

06:24.551 --> 06:25.862
Personally,

06:25.862 --> 06:27.965
I wanna contribute
the absolute most
that I can to the crew.

06:27.965 --> 06:31.068
<i>The best way that
I can see to that,</i>

06:31.068 --> 06:33.275
it's to take my experience
on boats,

06:33.275 --> 06:34.758
my experience
driving a hovercraft...

06:35.517 --> 06:36.310
All that.

06:37.413 --> 06:40.586
You know, even racing ATVs.

06:40.586 --> 06:43.896
There's not a lot of people
that can drive an airboat
up to Tsirku.

06:43.896 --> 06:44.965
I feel pretty confident.

06:57.379 --> 06:58.206
Let's go!

06:59.896 --> 07:03.068
<i>The Tsirku River
can be as shallow
as 12 inches.</i>

07:04.827 --> 07:08.413
<i>And it's over nine dangerous
miles up to Nugget Creek.</i>

07:36.517 --> 07:38.103
I'm
stuck already.

07:40.103 --> 07:41.172
<i>Scott makes it</i>

07:41.793 --> 07:43.896
<i>just 400 feet.</i>

07:43.896 --> 07:45.137
Well, that was a short one.

07:46.241 --> 07:47.344
Damn it!

07:50.413 --> 07:52.068
Woo!

07:52.068 --> 07:53.862
At least, you're not dead.

08:01.344 --> 08:03.517
The [bleep] were you thinking?

08:03.517 --> 08:06.965
It said, airboat!
I thought I could go on air!

08:18.448 --> 08:19.689
Oh,
that was embarrassing.

08:25.655 --> 08:27.103
Woo!

08:31.103 --> 08:32.413
Yeah!

08:54.275 --> 08:55.965
Good job
making it up here.

08:55.965 --> 08:57.517
We also just got...

08:57.517 --> 08:59.344
five barrels...

08:59.344 --> 09:01.862
- in one trip.
- in one trip.

09:01.862 --> 09:04.034
- That...
- That is actually
pretty awesome.

09:04.034 --> 09:05.896
- We're getting ahead.
- Yes, we are.

09:05.896 --> 09:08.103
And I don't have to worry
about doing it all the time.

09:08.103 --> 09:09.965
I'm glad you made it
without dying, man.

09:09.965 --> 09:11.103
That's a good plus.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.758
Okay, I'm good.

09:13.655 --> 09:14.689
We'll get
the fuel out.

09:16.344 --> 09:19.172
<i>Over 200 gallons
of gas safely delivered,</i>

09:19.965 --> 09:22.103
<i>Dustin can now run his dredges</i>

09:22.103 --> 09:23.758
<i>for four weeks straight.</i>

09:23.758 --> 09:26.206
<i>Plenty of time
to get to bedrock</i>

09:26.206 --> 09:27.793
<i>and Nugget Creek gold.</i>

09:36.551 --> 09:39.620
<i>Now, it's a mad dash
to the dive site</i>

09:40.551 --> 09:41.931
<i>to assess the damage.</i>

09:45.206 --> 09:49.068
<i>What I'm worried
about the most is the water
taking everything from me.</i>

09:51.103 --> 09:52.137
<i>I gotta find out
what's going on.</i>

09:52.137 --> 09:54.000
<i>You know, I'm worried.
I'm concerned.</i>

09:58.482 --> 10:00.655
Are you
kidding me?

10:03.482 --> 10:04.862
Everything survived.

10:08.068 --> 10:09.758
Looks like it anyway.

10:09.758 --> 10:11.172
That's crazy, brother.

10:12.103 --> 10:13.448
I never expected
something like that.

10:15.137 --> 10:17.068
Yeah, no.
It don't look bad.

10:17.068 --> 10:20.827
<i>Dustin's dive site
appears undamaged,</i>

10:20.827 --> 10:25.068
<i>but the storm surge
could have wreaked
havoc underwater.</i>

10:25.068 --> 10:28.724
We wanna see if the hole
got filled in. So, James...

10:28.724 --> 10:31.344
James is gonna go down
and find out where
the damage is.

10:32.655 --> 10:35.275
It was a good dive,
man. I enjoyed it.

10:35.275 --> 10:38.965
<i>Last week,
Carlos got them down
to eight feet</i>

10:38.965 --> 10:40.793
<i>where he started seeing gold.</i>

10:42.172 --> 10:43.931
<i>I'll get in
the water today.</i>

10:43.931 --> 10:45.517
<i>James' mission...</i>

10:45.517 --> 10:46.862
<i>check the dive hole</i>

10:46.862 --> 10:48.896
<i>and get them back
on the pay gravel.</i>

10:57.034 --> 10:59.655
Today, I just gotta
try my hardest

10:59.655 --> 11:02.862
to get us down
to a pay layer again.

11:02.862 --> 11:03.931
That's my goal.

11:04.344 --> 11:05.379
I got this.

11:05.379 --> 11:06.206
All right.

11:07.862 --> 11:08.793
Try to get his hair.

11:19.862 --> 11:20.655
Good?

11:24.862 --> 11:27.482
I think it is filled in
around four feet.

11:29.620 --> 11:30.448
Ah!

11:32.103 --> 11:33.689
This is how much
it's filled in.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.172
This type of

11:38.517 --> 11:40.896
Boy, it must have
really flooded. Huh.

11:41.344 --> 11:42.896
- Man.
- It did.

11:44.034 --> 11:47.103
Saddle up. I'm gonna
start dragging. Ready?

11:47.103 --> 11:48.172
All right, man.

11:52.068 --> 11:55.896
<i>The storm surge
has filled in over half
the dive hole.</i>

11:58.758 --> 12:03.448
<i>Now, James needs to remove
30 cubic yards of rocks
and gravel</i>

12:04.517 --> 12:06.551
<i>to get back down to eight feet</i>

12:07.344 --> 12:09.103
<i>and a gold-rich layer</i>

12:09.103 --> 12:11.965
<i>that should end in a massive
pile of nuggets.</i>

12:14.862 --> 12:16.620
We're gonna
go dredging.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.000
See what the damage is.

12:19.448 --> 12:22.620
♪ Two steps forward
three steps back ♪

12:32.724 --> 12:34.206
At this point,

12:34.206 --> 12:35.689
we're so used to setbacks,

12:35.689 --> 12:37.758
it doesn't even
bother us anymore.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.448
We just keep pushing
and pushing and pushing
and eventually...

12:41.379 --> 12:42.586
we'll get back
to where we were.

12:43.758 --> 12:46.551
What did you do wrong?

12:46.551 --> 12:48.896
You're standing out
in the middle
of a [bleep] damn creek.

12:48.896 --> 12:50.793
Looking at a bunch
of damn rocks.

12:53.068 --> 12:54.551
It could have been
a garbage bin.

12:56.655 --> 12:58.241
Could have...

12:58.241 --> 12:59.689
cleaned pools for a living.

13:00.689 --> 13:02.724
Instead, I'm standing
out here doing this.

13:02.724 --> 13:04.241
It's some weird stuff, man.

13:07.137 --> 13:08.379
It's some weird stuff.

13:13.206 --> 13:14.413
<i>Up ahead...</i>

13:14.413 --> 13:17.551
Never seen someone
so small go so hard
and so long.

13:17.551 --> 13:19.724
Now, everything has starting
to fall into place.

13:19.724 --> 13:21.310
<i>We're ready to see gold.</i>

13:21.310 --> 13:23.172
We're not that far
from bedrock.

13:23.172 --> 13:24.965
Don't even worry about
the generator.

13:45.551 --> 13:48.517
Well, the storm didn't mess
anything up, so that's good.

13:48.517 --> 13:50.965
<i>On a successful
second run,</i>

13:50.965 --> 13:53.689
<i>Scott's airboated in
the remainder of the crew.</i>

13:54.862 --> 13:56.103
Hey, Kayla.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.655
- Can you help me
down with this?
- Yup.

13:58.655 --> 14:00.620
<i>And new equipment
to turbo charge</i>

14:00.620 --> 14:02.413
<i>the second half
of their season.</i>

14:03.482 --> 14:05.862
<i>We decided
to swap motors.</i>

14:05.862 --> 14:07.689
We're kinda struggling
with suction power.

14:08.793 --> 14:10.586
Right now, we're running
the motors

14:10.586 --> 14:12.379
with smaller pumps.

14:12.379 --> 14:15.275
And they work, but...

14:15.275 --> 14:17.448
<i>if we swap
to the larger motors</i>

14:17.448 --> 14:18.758
<i>with a larger,
more powerful pump,</i>

14:18.758 --> 14:20.586
<i>we can move
a lot more material.</i>

14:20.586 --> 14:22.862
Right now, we're moving
at a snail's pace

14:22.862 --> 14:24.586
and we need to
step it up a lot more.

14:26.793 --> 14:28.517
<i>That's gonna open up
some territory.</i>

14:29.172 --> 14:30.344
<i>Last week...</i>

14:30.344 --> 14:33.344
<i>Kayla's crew dredge down
to six feet.</i>

14:33.344 --> 14:35.206
I saw a couple little blades.

14:35.206 --> 14:36.379
Oh

14:37.137 --> 14:38.241
Here's another one.

14:38.241 --> 14:39.931
The deeper we go,
the better it should get.

14:42.310 --> 14:44.724
<i>Now, 40 percent
more suction</i>

14:44.724 --> 14:46.379
<i>will accelerate their progress</i>

14:46.379 --> 14:48.689
<i>down to the gold
on Nugget Creek.</i>

14:50.931 --> 14:52.448
Any amount of time
we have left,

14:52.448 --> 14:54.896
we need to get as much done
as we possibly can.

14:54.896 --> 14:58.000
<i>So, anything we can do
right now to speed up
the process</i>

14:58.000 --> 14:59.206
is what we need to do.

15:05.586 --> 15:06.965
<i>I think,
in the long run,</i>

15:06.965 --> 15:09.379
we'll find more gold with it
'cause we'll get to move
more material.

15:11.655 --> 15:13.000
Dude, we did that
pretty fast.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.586
I know,
it wouldn't take too long.

15:17.551 --> 15:18.896
It's definitely
gonna help.

15:18.896 --> 15:20.758
- Yeah.
- It's gonna go
that much faster.

15:20.758 --> 15:23.241
Today's mission,
make [bleep] work faster.

15:27.896 --> 15:31.482
- So, you're gonna be
in the water today?
- Yeah.

15:31.482 --> 15:33.931
What I'm gonna focus on today
is I'm just gonna open
the hole up.

15:33.931 --> 15:35.827
Go down and uncover
a lot more real estate.

15:36.931 --> 15:38.896
The plan for today,
expanding the hole.

15:43.068 --> 15:45.896
Feel like I need a sword,
like, I'm gonna knight you.

15:45.896 --> 15:48.482
I know, right?

15:49.103 --> 15:50.206
Sir Paul.

15:53.931 --> 15:57.655
<i>Kayla's crew
already got the hole
to a depth of six feet.</i>

16:00.206 --> 16:02.758
<i>Now, Paul will expand
the sides</i>

16:02.758 --> 16:05.517
<i>and dredge down
between eight to ten feet</i>

16:07.586 --> 16:10.344
<i>where they expect
to hit bedrock gold.</i>

16:17.379 --> 16:18.172
Here we go.

16:21.517 --> 16:22.448
Feel good?

16:22.793 --> 16:23.620
Good?

16:30.517 --> 16:32.758
I'm excited.
I can't wait to see
what's down there.

16:35.310 --> 16:37.724
Wow! So, there's a bunch
of rocks back in here again.

16:37.724 --> 16:39.137
Holy

16:39.137 --> 16:40.551
I think another two feet.

16:43.379 --> 16:44.586
That sounded
really bad.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.517
Not good?

16:49.517 --> 16:51.137
Ah, it's all right.

16:51.137 --> 16:52.586
<i>I see
all this fine kitty litter,</i>

16:52.586 --> 16:54.551
<i>so we should be able to
blow through that really quick.</i>

17:03.103 --> 17:07.206
<i>600 feet down creek
at Dustin's Golden Gate's
dive site...</i>

17:11.241 --> 17:12.689
We're at about
six feet.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.034
<i>Two hours
into his dive,</i>

17:16.034 --> 17:19.448
<i>James pushes
through the infill
from the storm surge.</i>

17:21.758 --> 17:24.448
Ah.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.620
I'm just getting rid
of all this kitty litter.

17:31.827 --> 17:33.620
Oh, wow.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.034
I'm looking at it,
it looks fine.

17:36.068 --> 17:37.137
I can't believe it.

17:39.275 --> 17:42.068
Ah, this boulder is huge!

17:42.068 --> 17:44.068
<i>Eight or nine foot boulder,
I'm on.</i>

17:45.413 --> 17:46.965
By about six feet.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.793
I'm doing the splits
on it right now.

17:51.379 --> 17:52.517
This is how big it is.

17:53.827 --> 17:55.793
I'll try to get rid
of this sucker today.

17:59.172 --> 18:00.551
<i>The storm surge</i>

18:00.551 --> 18:04.724
<i>has rolled a rock the size
of an ATV into the dive hole.</i>

18:05.862 --> 18:08.034
<i>Totally blocking
James' progress.</i>

18:09.931 --> 18:11.793
<i>They'll need to blast it
to pieces</i>

18:12.413 --> 18:13.517
<i>in order to remove it</i>

18:15.586 --> 18:20.275
<i>before James can continue
dredging down to the pile
of bedrock nuggets.</i>

18:25.758 --> 18:27.413
I am ready to drill.

18:39.310 --> 18:42.275
I'm ready for two powerheads.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.517
James is trying to blast
a part of rock.

18:50.517 --> 18:53.448
<i>There's no telling how much
gold there could be sitting
underneath it as well.</i>

18:53.448 --> 18:56.965
So, this will be a big win
if we get this huge boulder
out today.

18:58.241 --> 18:59.689
Are you ready?

19:02.103 --> 19:03.413
Ooh!

19:03.413 --> 19:05.793
Holy
That went up my butt.

19:05.793 --> 19:08.448
- That was [bleep] great.
- Holy

19:14.448 --> 19:15.310
Didn't work.

19:18.103 --> 19:19.275
<i>Try that again.</i>

19:36.586 --> 19:38.206
Ready when you are.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.931
<i>Making any progress
down there, man?</i>

19:50.482 --> 19:51.931
<i>Did it break?</i>

19:51.931 --> 19:53.689
It's weird.
They won't move.

19:55.896 --> 19:57.931
It's weird, they don't
wanna come out.

19:57.931 --> 20:00.965
Only thing I can do is just
keep drilling and poppin' it.

20:00.965 --> 20:03.344
<i>Just keep
tracking it, man.
I don't know what to tell you.</i>

20:03.344 --> 20:04.517
<i>It's gotta get out of there.</i>

20:04.517 --> 20:07.241
<i>So, find the biggest piece,
you crack that.</i>

20:07.241 --> 20:08.931
<i>Just shatter everything.</i>

20:08.931 --> 20:10.931
<i>The blasters
are making cracks</i>

20:10.931 --> 20:13.448
<i>in the eight ton
granite boulder.</i>

20:13.448 --> 20:16.275
<i>But it refuses to come apart.</i>

20:16.275 --> 20:18.758
That boulder that I got
right here in front of me

20:18.758 --> 20:21.241
is I think, listening
to James...

20:21.241 --> 20:23.310
about half the size of what
he's trying to break.

20:23.310 --> 20:25.655
These boulders
are kicking our ass.

20:25.655 --> 20:27.413
Yup, ready
for some powerheads.

20:27.413 --> 20:28.655
I'll take both.

20:31.034 --> 20:33.137
That generator
is working?

20:33.137 --> 20:34.586
Ah, yeah.
That generator is working.

20:36.896 --> 20:37.896
Just shove it in.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.827
Okay. Diver ready.

20:50.068 --> 20:52.758
How far you think you got
with that rock so far, man?

20:52.758 --> 20:56.000
Oh, man.
Nothing's... falling off.

20:56.758 --> 20:57.586
<i>Seriously.</i>

21:00.793 --> 21:01.931
<i>Come out.</i>

21:01.931 --> 21:04.551
<i>Five hours
into his dive,</i>

21:04.551 --> 21:07.275
<i>unable to remove
the monster boulder,</i>

21:07.275 --> 21:09.517
<i>James calls it quits.</i>

21:12.965 --> 21:14.724
<i>We just ran
into this giant boulder,</i>

21:14.724 --> 21:16.344
<i>it's turning out to be</i>

21:16.344 --> 21:17.724
another one of our nemesis

21:17.724 --> 21:19.793
because it's not
splitting in half,

21:19.793 --> 21:21.448
<i>like some of the other ones
have been.</i>

21:21.448 --> 21:25.000
Which... that's what we need,
so we can get it out
in a timely manner.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.517
<i>This is... It's a whole
different kind of boulder
that's down there.</i>

21:28.517 --> 21:30.517
Some of 'em just
split in half,

21:30.517 --> 21:32.241
some of 'em don't hardly
break at all.

21:32.241 --> 21:33.827
Some break
in a million pieces.

21:33.827 --> 21:35.827
It's another challenge here
at Nugget Creek.

21:35.827 --> 21:37.931
But we've still got a lot
to get through

21:37.931 --> 21:40.793
before we get to all the gold
that we know is here.

21:40.793 --> 21:43.241
So, let's just keep on
chugging along.

21:46.137 --> 21:49.137
It's breaking,
but not getting rid of itself.

21:49.137 --> 21:50.896
So, I'll go down tomorrow

21:50.896 --> 21:53.620
and we will find out
what the situation is.

21:53.620 --> 21:56.827
<i>Welcome to my life when you
look at a rock and go, "Huh...</i>

21:56.827 --> 21:58.000
There's three days."

21:58.448 --> 22:00.103
That's a big deal.

22:00.103 --> 22:01.827
<i>But we're gonna keep going.</i>

22:02.551 --> 22:03.551
Too dumb to quit.

22:04.310 --> 22:05.551
Too stubborn to stop.

22:23.344 --> 22:24.758
<i>It's just one rock.</i>

22:25.448 --> 22:26.758
<i>It is right in the way.</i>

22:28.137 --> 22:29.344
I think, it's too big.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.724
<i>At Kayla's
dive site...</i>

22:32.724 --> 22:34.896
<i>The poweredge,
maybe, might be strong enough,</i>

22:34.896 --> 22:37.034
<i>but I don't know.</i>

22:37.034 --> 22:41.482
<i>Dredging down,
Paul is confronted with
a huge four ton bolder.</i>

22:42.310 --> 22:43.793
<i>It won't go.</i>

22:43.793 --> 22:45.000
<i>Damn, that's frustrating.</i>

22:47.275 --> 22:48.586
<i>Like Dustin,</i>

22:48.586 --> 22:52.206
<i>Kayla's crew is now faced
with an unmovable roadblock.</i>

22:53.448 --> 22:54.724
<i>You know what...</i>

22:54.724 --> 22:57.448
I wonder if you drilled
from the top

22:57.448 --> 23:00.827
and drilled one from the side
and break it off in chunks.

23:00.827 --> 23:01.655
<i>That might work.</i>

23:04.034 --> 23:06.482
<i>The granite rock
is so large,</i>

23:06.482 --> 23:10.241
<i>Paul does not believe
the blasters will fracture it
all the way through.</i>

23:12.689 --> 23:14.034
<i>Kayla's solution...</i>

23:14.034 --> 23:17.413
<i>drill two blasters
at 90 degrees to each other.</i>

23:18.655 --> 23:20.793
<i>Detonating 'em simultaneously</i>

23:20.793 --> 23:22.896
<i>should break off
corner sections</i>

23:24.620 --> 23:26.862
<i>small enough for them
to winch out.</i>

23:28.137 --> 23:30.896
<i>And continue down
to bedrock gold.</i>

23:34.137 --> 23:37.000
Being in an area that has
a lot of really big boulders,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.586
it's really essential to have
these underwater drills

23:39.586 --> 23:42.517
because... the winches
are great,

23:42.517 --> 23:44.896
but they can only
carry so much.

23:44.896 --> 23:47.965
So, when you have really,
really big boulders,

23:49.172 --> 23:51.482
it's very vital
to make 'em smaller.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.517
All right, Paul,
I have a drill ready for you.

23:57.517 --> 23:59.965
Copy that. See if I can
break the end of it up.

24:01.034 --> 24:01.931
Thank you.

24:09.896 --> 24:10.689
Thank you.

24:16.103 --> 24:17.275
<i>Ready?</i>

24:17.275 --> 24:19.034
- I am.
- All right.

24:19.517 --> 24:22.448
Three, two, one...

24:26.758 --> 24:27.896
That worked great.

24:30.068 --> 24:31.137
choker.

24:35.517 --> 24:36.310
Okay.

24:37.482 --> 24:38.344
Take her away.

24:56.275 --> 24:57.379
<i>That's the last of it.</i>

24:58.586 --> 25:00.000
That was a big ass rock.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.517
- All three of these pieces
are from it, right?
- <i>Yup.</i>

25:04.448 --> 25:07.413
Hopefully, there's some nice
nuggets underneath where
that rock was at.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.965
The one big boulder
was kinda like a keystone.

25:12.965 --> 25:15.793
It was locking everything
in and around it and below it.

25:15.793 --> 25:19.827
So, now that that's broken up,
we can hopefully expose
more area on the bottom.

25:19.827 --> 25:23.103
So, we have a really good...
really good day going so far.

25:25.896 --> 25:27.931
<i>Okay, take her away.</i>

25:37.931 --> 25:40.965
<i>Paul continues
to expand the dive hole</i>

25:40.965 --> 25:43.965
<i>and push down
towards bedrock gold.</i>

25:46.551 --> 25:47.689
Nice rock, buddy.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.310
And go!

25:51.344 --> 25:52.206
Yeah!

25:56.413 --> 25:57.586
Looks like things
are going pretty good.

25:57.586 --> 25:59.000
Paul's got a really good
dive going.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.862
He's been in
for quite a while.

26:00.862 --> 26:02.103
About ready
to wrap it up.

26:02.827 --> 26:03.586
<i>Yes.</i>

26:04.448 --> 26:05.689
<i>Seven feet.</i>

26:07.965 --> 26:09.482
<i>Five hours in,</i>

26:09.482 --> 26:11.620
<i>Paul's expanded the hole</i>

26:11.620 --> 26:14.689
<i>and dredged down
to seven feet.</i>

26:14.689 --> 26:18.724
<i>Just inches from where
the crew hope to find
gold nuggets.</i>

26:20.620 --> 26:23.068
I didn't expect to make
the hole that deep,
trying to get out.

26:24.862 --> 26:26.827
You got heavy.

26:26.827 --> 26:27.896
[bleep] you.

26:28.413 --> 26:30.275
I'm full of water.

26:30.275 --> 26:33.655
Getting that one rock out
opened up a lot of real
estate down there.

26:33.655 --> 26:35.827
Good job, dude.

26:35.827 --> 26:38.103
Hopefully, we got some gold
in the box at the end
of the day.

26:47.793 --> 26:49.241
I don't see
anything yet.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.931
Hopefully, we'll be
really close to bedrock
and see some gold.

26:54.931 --> 26:56.068
That's what
I'm hoping for.

27:00.241 --> 27:01.103
We'll get it.

27:01.862 --> 27:03.689
- Yup.
- We're getting close.

27:03.689 --> 27:05.655
We're getting there.

27:09.137 --> 27:10.758
<i>We're making
really good progress.</i>

27:10.758 --> 27:12.655
<i>We're getting a lot
of stuff moved.</i>

27:12.655 --> 27:14.689
<i>We're getting rocks blasted.</i>

27:16.724 --> 27:18.344
This is gonna be
a game changer.

27:18.344 --> 27:20.931
It's gonna help us a lot
in finding a ton of gold.

27:45.655 --> 27:47.137
<i>This is not good.</i>

27:47.862 --> 27:49.034
<i>Carlos isn't here.</i>

27:49.724 --> 27:51.068
His family got sick.

27:51.758 --> 27:53.241
<i>At first light,</i>

27:53.241 --> 27:55.965
<i>Dustin rush Carlos
down the river</i>

27:55.965 --> 27:58.586
<i>to tend to a family emergency
in Haines.</i>

28:00.551 --> 28:03.655
<i>I'm gonna have to,
basically, fill in for...</i>

28:04.275 --> 28:05.310
<i>Carlos.</i>

28:06.931 --> 28:09.551
<i>I know this is not ideal.</i>

28:09.551 --> 28:10.758
<i>Nothing else I could do.</i>

28:15.275 --> 28:16.793
<i>With everything
on the line,</i>

28:17.689 --> 28:20.034
<i>Dustin's season
is going from bad</i>

28:20.896 --> 28:21.896
<i>to worse.</i>

28:22.655 --> 28:24.103
<i>What's up?</i>

28:24.103 --> 28:25.517
How are you
guys doing?

28:25.517 --> 28:28.551
We had a really
good day yesterday,
we got a lot of stuff done.

28:28.551 --> 28:29.482
Awesome.

28:30.068 --> 28:31.137
My crew...

28:31.137 --> 28:33.448
we're gonna have to
step up our drill game.

28:33.448 --> 28:35.448
Here's where
we're getting stuck.

28:35.448 --> 28:38.517
The rocks are so much
bigger than we're used to.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.896
So much bigger.

28:39.896 --> 28:42.448
And we're used to just being
able to crack a rock in half.

28:42.448 --> 28:45.517
Take one half and maybe,
crack it into thirds.

28:45.517 --> 28:48.034
Well, we're gonna have to
crack 'em, like, 15 times.

28:48.034 --> 28:49.620
You don't feel like
you're making progress,

28:49.620 --> 28:51.896
but it's the only progress
we can make.

28:51.896 --> 28:54.620
I wonder if you
drilled from the top

28:54.620 --> 28:55.862
and drilled one from the side

28:55.862 --> 28:58.103
and set it off, like...
like this.

28:58.103 --> 29:00.068
- Yeah.
- So, you can
break it off in chunks.

29:00.068 --> 29:02.793
- Like, we did
yesterday with Kayla.
- Exactly.

29:02.793 --> 29:05.448
- Instead of doing,
like, lines...
- Try to slice it...

29:05.448 --> 29:07.241
Do one here and then,
one this way.

29:07.241 --> 29:08.379
So, maybe the cracks meet

29:08.379 --> 29:10.379
- and just pop the whole
chunk off.
- Okay.

29:10.379 --> 29:11.620
Sounds like a good idea.

29:11.620 --> 29:13.000
- Let's do that.
- Sounds good.

29:16.724 --> 29:20.448
<i>Kayla's proven
double-blasting technique</i>

29:20.448 --> 29:24.586
<i>could be the solution
Dustin needs to get
beyond the monster boulder</i>

29:25.379 --> 29:27.172
<i>and down to bedrock gold.</i>

29:30.137 --> 29:32.413
<i>Cracking rocks
are going to be the name
of the game here.</i>

29:32.413 --> 29:34.689
<i>No one has dug
these damn rocks.</i>

29:35.344 --> 29:36.827
So, underneath these rocks,

29:37.275 --> 29:38.724
with any luck,

29:39.413 --> 29:40.827
is gonna be giant gold.

29:40.827 --> 29:42.379
Actual big, big gold.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.344
All right. Here we go.

30:00.344 --> 30:01.758
Let's get to the water, man.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.275
Bringing a prayer here.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.241
All right. Time to suit up.

30:11.206 --> 30:12.172
It's gonna be a good day.

30:17.862 --> 30:19.724
<i>To get his season
back on track...</i>

30:20.344 --> 30:21.137
Ready?

30:23.310 --> 30:26.827
<i>Crew leader, Dustin,
takes matters into
his own hands.</i>

30:29.034 --> 30:30.000
You like it tucked under?

30:30.482 --> 30:31.275
Yeah.

30:33.413 --> 30:34.206
Looks good.

30:43.931 --> 30:44.965
You want the powerheads?

30:47.965 --> 30:48.758
Thank you.

30:58.275 --> 30:59.517
All right. Here we go.

31:01.275 --> 31:03.206
Three, two, one...

31:03.655 --> 31:04.482
Oh.

31:06.620 --> 31:07.413
What?

31:07.965 --> 31:08.862
Did it go?

31:09.896 --> 31:10.724
Seriously.

31:12.827 --> 31:14.586
I don't know what's
going on with this thing.

31:15.586 --> 31:16.689
Let's try this again.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.931
Three, two, one.

31:21.586 --> 31:22.965
Ah!

31:26.965 --> 31:29.379
Ah,
this is not working.

31:29.379 --> 31:30.758
I don't know what else to do.

31:34.172 --> 31:36.862
Wes has got another
powerhead if you want that.

31:36.862 --> 31:37.724
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:40.448 --> 31:42.482
What is [bleep] wrong
with this though?

31:42.793 --> 31:43.551
Yeah.

31:46.655 --> 31:47.448
Ready.

31:48.034 --> 31:50.034
Three, two, one...

31:59.310 --> 32:02.689
<i>None of blasters
will detonate.</i>

32:02.689 --> 32:05.655
We have power to it,
but it's not popping.

32:05.655 --> 32:07.034
Everything
is plugged in.

32:07.931 --> 32:08.827
We're not gonna move it.

32:10.517 --> 32:12.034
All right,
we need to fix this.

32:13.310 --> 32:15.034
Are we done over here?

32:15.034 --> 32:16.517
We won't be
diving today.

32:17.586 --> 32:19.000
You know,
we'll get it figured out.

32:21.413 --> 32:22.896
You know, what I think
the problem is?

32:22.896 --> 32:24.172
Think I figured it out.

32:24.172 --> 32:25.896
The cable is ruined.

32:25.896 --> 32:27.793
I can try to fix it
by tomorrow.

32:36.448 --> 32:37.586
That's what
I needed...

32:38.586 --> 32:40.482
To fail more.

32:40.482 --> 32:42.551
Whenever it feels like
we're making progress,

32:43.482 --> 32:44.793
something sends us back.

32:44.793 --> 32:46.724
The simplest damn things, too.

32:47.241 --> 32:48.172
Come on.

32:49.551 --> 32:50.965
Give me a break.

32:51.758 --> 32:52.896
We need some gold.

32:54.379 --> 32:55.517
We know it's here.

32:57.103 --> 32:58.068
We need a win.

33:24.931 --> 33:26.275
I'm looking forward
to get in the water,

33:26.275 --> 33:28.482
especially, since we did
the upgrades on the dredge,

33:28.482 --> 33:30.448
<i>so we should have
a lot better suction</i>

33:30.448 --> 33:31.931
<i>which will move
a lot more material.</i>

33:33.137 --> 33:35.137
<i>Using the new
more powerful motors,</i>

33:35.965 --> 33:38.068
<i>Kayla prepares
to dredge deeper</i>

33:38.068 --> 33:40.275
<i>than they have ever dug
at Nugget Creek.</i>

33:41.827 --> 33:43.310
<i>Hopefully, we start
seeing bedrock soon</i>

33:43.310 --> 33:45.931
<i>because if we hit bedrock,
we should see some gold.</i>

33:45.931 --> 33:48.172
<i>Pushing down
from seven feet,</i>

33:48.172 --> 33:51.172
<i>bedrock could be
just one foot below.</i>

34:00.862 --> 34:03.068
- Top first, top first.
- Top one first.

34:05.172 --> 34:08.137
I'm really
excited to finally be getting
in the water and get to work.

34:15.137 --> 34:16.000
A little bit more.

34:21.689 --> 34:23.068
Suction is way better.

34:31.448 --> 34:33.655
I see it throw it
a lot faster.

34:33.655 --> 34:35.241
Yeah, those bigger
motors and bigger pumps

34:35.241 --> 34:36.689
were definitely
the ticket, huh?

34:36.689 --> 34:37.620
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:39.758 --> 34:41.241
<i>Definitely a good call
on that.</i>

34:48.517 --> 34:50.172
How's it looking?

34:50.172 --> 34:51.724
We're making
good progress now.

34:58.758 --> 35:00.724
He's chewing up
some good [bleep] now.

35:05.724 --> 35:07.310
<i>Three hours later...</i>

35:07.310 --> 35:11.172
Never seen someone
so small go so hard
and so long.

35:11.172 --> 35:13.758
People always say, dynamite
comes in small packages.

35:15.827 --> 35:17.482
There's living proof
right there.

35:20.862 --> 35:22.689
<i>How are you
doing down there, Kayla?</i>

35:22.689 --> 35:24.000
<i>Doing okay.</i>

35:25.275 --> 35:26.206
<i>Eight feet deep.</i>

35:27.275 --> 35:28.965
<i>Reaching eight feet deep,</i>

35:28.965 --> 35:31.655
<i>Kayla should start
seeing signs of bedrock.</i>

35:38.241 --> 35:40.103
<i>Scott, look at this.
Come here. Hurry.</i>

35:41.620 --> 35:42.758
No

35:44.379 --> 35:45.724
clay layer.

35:47.965 --> 35:49.517
- Hot.
- Yeah, man!

35:50.758 --> 35:51.758
That's clay.

35:54.379 --> 35:57.724
That lock in gold like
vice, wouldn't it?

35:57.724 --> 36:00.000
It just makes me wonder
if we're close to bedrock.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.379
That's what
I'm wondering, too.

36:04.931 --> 36:06.862
<i>Down at eight feet,</i>

36:06.862 --> 36:09.551
<i>Kayla's discovery
could be a breakthrough.</i>

36:11.620 --> 36:13.551
<i>Clay is formed of silt</i>

36:13.551 --> 36:16.344
<i>which settles at the lowest
point on a creek bed.</i>

36:18.482 --> 36:21.517
<i>Meaning, she could be inches
from paygravel.</i>

36:25.655 --> 36:26.586
<i>It's amazing.</i>

36:29.275 --> 36:31.000
<i>We're right there
on that layer.</i>

36:31.000 --> 36:33.310
We're not that far
from bedrock.

36:33.310 --> 36:36.413
<i>Closing in on
her first big success
of the season,</i>

36:37.275 --> 36:38.655
<i>Kayla pushes on.</i>

36:40.275 --> 36:42.482
You're killing it, girl.

36:42.482 --> 36:45.310
We can be getting real close
to a good payday here.

37:14.896 --> 37:17.137
<i>Another two hours later...</i>

37:17.137 --> 37:18.931
She's definitely
got endurance.

37:18.931 --> 37:20.827
- Yeah.
- I'll give her that.

37:20.827 --> 37:22.758
Yeah,
she's getting tired.

37:22.758 --> 37:25.482
Yeah,
you tell her she's tired,
that she needs to come out.

37:25.482 --> 37:28.413
I'm not.

37:29.379 --> 37:31.344
Rock, paper, scissors,
who tells her.

37:38.206 --> 37:39.689
Probably gonna
come up pretty soon.

37:42.034 --> 37:43.413
All righty. I'm gonna pop up.

37:44.103 --> 37:45.482
Copy that.

37:45.482 --> 37:47.689
<i>Diving for six hours,</i>

37:47.689 --> 37:50.206
<i>Kayla has dredged
beyond eight feet.</i>

37:51.310 --> 37:53.862
<i>Deeper than either crew
has reached</i>

37:53.862 --> 37:56.551
<i>at Nugget Creek all season.</i>

37:56.551 --> 38:00.379
So, I got the hole
all the way from...
the hose that's here.

38:00.379 --> 38:03.517
- Yup.
- All the way up to
where the hose is there.

38:03.517 --> 38:04.931
And all the way to here.

38:04.931 --> 38:07.137
Yeah, you moved
a lot of rocks.

38:07.137 --> 38:09.793
It feels good having a hole
open up again.

38:09.793 --> 38:11.137
That was a lot of work.

38:11.137 --> 38:12.137
yeah.

38:14.758 --> 38:16.586
I'm excited to see
what's in the box.

38:34.448 --> 38:35.827
I saw a couple little flakes.

38:37.413 --> 38:38.275
That's awesome.

38:39.517 --> 38:40.655
That's a good sign.

38:40.655 --> 38:43.379
I gotta think that's some
good material there, bud.

38:43.379 --> 38:44.655
It's what
I'm hoping for.

38:45.517 --> 38:46.827
I'm pretty
happy with that.

38:46.827 --> 38:47.827
I'm hungry.

38:49.172 --> 38:50.206
I need food.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.379
We've had a really good day.

38:54.620 --> 38:56.275
<i>Gold in the sluices</i>

38:56.275 --> 38:58.000
<i>and clay discovered,</i>

38:58.000 --> 39:00.793
<i>Kayla's crew could be one dive</i>

39:00.793 --> 39:02.551
<i>from a golden payday.</i>

39:05.172 --> 39:07.000
- You wanna hear
something really funny?
- A-ha.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.172
You know, earlier, when we
went to check the spark plugs

39:09.172 --> 39:10.379
and I shoved 'em in here...

39:10.379 --> 39:13.551
Apparently, I dove all day
with a spark plug in my suit.

39:16.172 --> 39:17.379
All right there, Sparky.

39:17.379 --> 39:18.862
'Cause at the end,

39:18.862 --> 39:21.275
my weight belt or something
must have held it up
higher or something.

39:21.275 --> 39:22.655
- Oh
- When I was getting undressed,

39:22.655 --> 39:24.862
I was like,
"What is in my shoe?"

39:24.862 --> 39:27.896
- Got a spark plug
in my suit all day long.
- No wonder you were energized.

39:30.758 --> 39:32.896
<i>Now, everything
has starting to fall
into place.</i>

39:32.896 --> 39:34.620
<i>We're ready to see
what we came here for</i>

39:34.620 --> 39:35.965
<i>and that's the sea gold.</i>

39:35.965 --> 39:38.758
And I'm starting to be a lot
more optimistic about it.

39:38.758 --> 39:40.310
Today was actually
a really good day.

39:40.310 --> 39:41.482
We got a lot done.

39:41.482 --> 39:43.758
And I'm really happy
with what we accomplished.

40:00.655 --> 40:03.344
- <i>Come on, Lis.
Let's do your hair. Okay?
- Okay.</i>

40:03.344 --> 40:06.827
Daddy, you have to wear
glasses for my hair.

40:06.827 --> 40:08.517
I gotta wear glasses?

40:08.517 --> 40:09.896
I don't need glasses
to do your hair.

40:09.896 --> 40:11.724
I need glasses to read.

40:11.724 --> 40:14.310
<i>As the rest
of the crew battle
Nugget Creek...</i>

40:14.965 --> 40:16.689
Look, Daddy did it.

40:16.689 --> 40:19.517
<i>Carlos is home
for a family emergency.</i>

40:19.517 --> 40:20.965
Mm-hmm.

40:20.965 --> 40:24.000
My wife, she had to
go back to California
to deal with her mom.

40:24.379 --> 40:25.344
She's sick.

40:25.344 --> 40:28.172
<i>And we're praying
for a good outcome.</i>

40:28.172 --> 40:30.413
So, right now,
I'm watching my little girl.

40:30.413 --> 40:31.551
I'm trying to do two things.

40:31.551 --> 40:35.034
You know, mining and playing
Mister Dad. You know?

40:35.034 --> 40:37.517
<i>I'm gonna have to take
a break from mining.</i>

40:37.517 --> 40:38.655
Gotta take care
of the family first.

41:00.862 --> 41:03.275
Well, I got some pieces
I got to repair today.

41:03.275 --> 41:06.000
<i>Dustin's dive site
is shut down.</i>

41:06.620 --> 41:09.172
<i>West must fix the blasters</i>

41:09.172 --> 41:12.931
<i>if they're to have any chance
to destroy the giant boulder</i>

41:12.931 --> 41:14.206
<i>blocking the gold.</i>

41:15.827 --> 41:18.413
These cables go to
our blasting system.

41:18.413 --> 41:20.448
What happens when they blow
a rock apart, they...

41:20.448 --> 41:23.103
they end up, some of the rocks
will come down and crush
these things.

41:23.103 --> 41:27.206
Rocks land on this cable
in there 'cause that granite
is sharp and heavy.

41:27.206 --> 41:29.413
It just cuts in two
like it's nothing.

41:29.413 --> 41:31.862
Got to see if I can get
all of these repaired.

41:31.862 --> 41:34.241
All I have to do
is re-solder these in

41:34.241 --> 41:36.551
to these little holders.

41:36.551 --> 41:37.965
And all these years
we've been doing this...

41:37.965 --> 41:41.103
where we find large gold
is always under these
larger boulders.

41:41.103 --> 41:43.172
If we can't blast
these boulders,

41:43.172 --> 41:44.275
can't get below the boulders,

41:44.275 --> 41:46.137
we're not getting the gold
that we're looking for.

41:49.551 --> 41:51.551
<i>Using a simple
glue gun,</i>

41:51.551 --> 41:53.793
<i>Wes insulates
the copper cables,</i>

41:54.586 --> 41:56.896
<i>so they can work under water.</i>

41:56.896 --> 41:58.620
<i>Everything up here
wants to break.</i>

41:58.620 --> 42:00.448
<i>It's a never ending battle.</i>

42:00.448 --> 42:02.275
So, at this point
in the season,

42:02.275 --> 42:04.862
you know, even if we ordered
more cables,

42:04.862 --> 42:07.551
I don't think we can get 'em
before we had snow
and ice here.

42:07.551 --> 42:09.689
If we can't keep
the system working

42:09.689 --> 42:11.068
and busting rocks,

42:11.068 --> 42:13.000
then we're wasting our time.

42:14.965 --> 42:17.586
Okay. I've got all the ones
that I'm trying
to get repaired

42:17.586 --> 42:19.379
back together.

42:19.379 --> 42:21.137
Okay, keep your
fingers crossed.

42:22.551 --> 42:24.827
<i>Dustin's crew
should finally be able to</i>

42:24.827 --> 42:27.034
<i>blast apart
the massive boulder.</i>

42:29.551 --> 42:30.344
There we go.

42:31.310 --> 42:33.068
Another cable
back in working order.

42:47.379 --> 42:49.551
<i>Today, I'm exhausted.</i>

42:49.551 --> 42:52.482
Need a break,
we can't take it. At all.

42:52.482 --> 42:54.724
Body's failing,
mind is failing.

42:55.241 --> 42:56.172
Gotta keep going.

43:03.551 --> 43:05.758
I'm going down.
I'm gonna dive.

43:05.758 --> 43:08.862
I'm gonna try my hardest
to get some rocks...

43:08.862 --> 43:10.896
some really big rocks
out of the way.

43:11.965 --> 43:13.586
I feel really good about it.

43:27.655 --> 43:28.965
Hmm

43:32.379 --> 43:34.758
Another typical day
the [bleep] don't
work.

43:36.482 --> 43:37.862
I gotta get this going.

43:42.068 --> 43:43.931
How do you break rock
without a generator?

43:47.448 --> 43:48.931
<i>No generator</i>

43:48.931 --> 43:51.413
<i>means no electricity
to the blasters.</i>

43:52.689 --> 43:54.689
<i>Until Wes
can fix it,</i>

43:54.689 --> 43:57.620
<i>Dustin's dive site
is at a standstill.</i>

44:01.206 --> 44:02.000
Hold on.

44:02.793 --> 44:04.034
Hold on.

44:04.034 --> 44:05.275
Let me take a look at it.

44:11.758 --> 44:13.896
It has oil and everything?
All that

44:15.896 --> 44:17.965
Yeah, I changed
the oil the other day.
It's got fresh oil.

44:17.965 --> 44:20.172
I checked it,
it's pristine looking.

44:20.172 --> 44:23.068
It could be the oil sensor
could be no good anymore.

44:23.551 --> 44:24.793
But I can't tell

44:24.793 --> 44:26.275
until I can get into it.

44:26.275 --> 44:28.103
<i>To diagnose
the fault,</i>

44:28.103 --> 44:29.724
<i>crew mechanic, Wes,</i>

44:29.724 --> 44:33.586
<i>needs to dismantle
the generator's outer casing.</i>

44:33.586 --> 44:35.137
Now, I'm just
standing around.

44:36.758 --> 44:37.551
James.

44:38.379 --> 44:39.413
Cut off the dredge, please.

44:48.034 --> 44:49.172
Why are you so mad?

44:49.172 --> 44:50.275
'Cause I'm just
trying to help,

44:50.275 --> 44:51.724
I don't understand
what I did wrong.

44:53.068 --> 44:54.862
You just come and took over
what I was doing.

44:54.862 --> 44:57.034
Listen, I can stand here
and watch you

44:57.034 --> 44:58.068
if that's what you want.

44:58.862 --> 45:00.068
You tell me what you want.

45:00.068 --> 45:02.448
Let's just
call it a day.

45:02.448 --> 45:03.931
Don't even worry
about the generator.

45:15.689 --> 45:17.000
I saw that coming.

45:21.517 --> 45:23.137
I gotta
get out of here.

45:23.137 --> 45:25.241
It's way too much effort
for no gold.

45:29.931 --> 45:32.103
<i>Halfway through
his season,</i>

45:32.103 --> 45:33.827
<i>a crew member down</i>

45:33.827 --> 45:36.586
<i>and with constant
mechanical breakdowns,</i>

45:36.586 --> 45:40.172
<i>Dustin spent his life savings
on Nugget Creek.</i>

45:40.172 --> 45:43.000
<i>And has no way
of getting to the gold.</i>

45:44.241 --> 45:46.172
He's cracked under
too much pressure.

45:47.448 --> 45:50.068
He's been telling us everyday

45:50.068 --> 45:52.896
and it's been
weighing us all down.

45:52.896 --> 45:55.206
<i>It's been a really
trying year, we're trying
to get in to get gold.</i>

45:55.206 --> 45:57.344
All we're finding
are these huge ass boulders.

45:57.344 --> 45:59.931
And so, everybody's
patience is running thin.

46:02.310 --> 46:04.896
Tensions are just so high,
it's unbelievable.

46:13.172 --> 46:16.172
<i>This is
a stressful situation.</i>

46:16.172 --> 46:19.034
I don't know how many strikes
it's gonna take before
Dustin says, that's it.

46:19.724 --> 46:21.310
I think that was strike two.

46:22.241 --> 46:23.793
I'm hoping it wasn't
strike three.

46:45.551 --> 46:49.103
I finally realized y'all
are tougher than I am.

46:52.103 --> 46:54.206
<i>Up ahead,
this season...</i>

46:54.206 --> 46:56.344
<i>We've been out here
working for three months</i>

46:56.344 --> 46:58.103
and still no gold.

46:58.103 --> 46:59.758
If you stay with it,

46:59.758 --> 47:01.275
this is what
you're gonna find.

47:01.275 --> 47:02.241
That's awesome.

47:03.482 --> 47:05.793
<i>Scott for
Nugget Creek. Anybody there?</i>

47:05.793 --> 47:08.103
My boat's dead,
we're in the river.

47:08.103 --> 47:09.724
It's your ticket
right into that wall.

47:09.724 --> 47:11.137
Hold on, boy. Hold on!

47:12.827 --> 47:14.724
Get out! We gotta go!

47:14.724 --> 47:16.172
Go, go, go, go!

47:16.172 --> 47:17.413
Right now,
it's a waiting game.

47:17.413 --> 47:18.965
<i>We gotta let it run its course</i>

47:18.965 --> 47:20.965
and then, check
the carnage afterwards.

47:20.965 --> 47:23.620
<i>Feel cursed here.
Feel like this place hates us.</i>

47:23.620 --> 47:25.586
Beyond anything I thought
was possible.

47:26.896 --> 47:28.655
But too stubborn to stop.

47:29.689 --> 47:31.482
Going back to our roots, man.

47:31.482 --> 47:32.413
Scary diving.

47:32.413 --> 47:34.241
I can smell the gold.

47:34.241 --> 47:36.448
It's about time!
Yeah!

47:36.448 --> 47:38.862
<i>There's a crack
in the bedrock and I see
a piece of gold.</i>

47:38.862 --> 47:41.379
We found gold!

47:41.379 --> 47:42.931
It's right there!

47:44.620 --> 47:47.931
We got gold!

47:47.931 --> 47:51.068
I [bleep] worked my
into the dirt for her.

47:51.068 --> 47:54.931
We need to regroup
'cause we're on a steady path
to destruction here.

47:56.344 --> 47:57.793
This is our final push.

47:57.793 --> 48:00.689
Get out of there.

48:00.689 --> 48:03.689
That's gonna give us
nightmares for fricking years.
