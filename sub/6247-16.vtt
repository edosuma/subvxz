WEBVTT

00:04.280 --> 00:06.589
<i>- Where are we?
- An access shaft</i>

00:06.680 --> 00:10.798
to an underwater aqueduct
which has never been activated.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.598
I mean, geographically?

00:12.680 --> 00:16.719
Beneath Wisconsin and Massachusetts
Avenues, near the NationaI CathedraI.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.314
How far down? We seem very far down.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.870
- Oh, about 60 feet, so far.
- Is there any other way?

00:22.960 --> 00:26.919
<i>It's a maze down here, but this was
the fastest way to get to the body.</i>

00:27.000 --> 00:30.595
These lines have load tolerances
that are more than adequate.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.878
What about shock tolerance? The
rope jerks, kinetic energy increases

00:34.960 --> 00:38.396
<i>- and snap, we fall to our deaths.
- Hey!</i>

00:38.480 --> 00:41.313
OK. Let's say we just stop the chatter.

00:46.240 --> 00:52.270
City workers found it. Public works are under
federaI jurisdiction, so this is your party.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.278
<i>Oh.</i>

00:59.360 --> 01:03.069
- What's at the top of that shaft?
- Utility tunneI accessing steam pipes.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.355
- May I borrow your gun?
- Why do you want it?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.670
I'm not gonna shoot anyone, I promise.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.832
It's not a hammer, or anything.

01:10.920 --> 01:16.313
We've been working together for months,
Booth. A little trust would be nice.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.834
- CarefuI.
- OK. Hold this.

01:25.320 --> 01:29.029
Now they'll eat each other
and leave our remains alone.

01:29.120 --> 01:32.829
You know, you do know I have to
file a report with the review board

01:32.920 --> 01:35.309
each time I discharge
a round from my weapon?

01:35.400 --> 01:40.155
Pictures, Zack. The rats scattered the
remains, so give me a five-metre radius.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.915
The velocity of the fall
shattered her body on impact.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.389
Tibias and fibulas
broken below the knees.

01:46.480 --> 01:49.313
- Vertebrae compressed and shattered.
- "Her"?

01:49.400 --> 01:52.756
Yeah. I just hope that she was
dead before the rats got to her.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.957
Oh, God. Any idea how
long she's been down here?

01:56.040 --> 01:58.838
We should get answers when
Hodgins analyses the bugs,

01:58.920 --> 02:01.229
but rats could strip a body in days.

02:01.320 --> 02:04.312
Shirt, pants, but no jacket or shoes.

02:05.280 --> 02:07.953
No way rats could carry that off.

02:09.039 --> 02:10.792
Excuse me?

02:11.880 --> 02:13.552
Sir? Sir!

02:13.640 --> 02:18.555
What the hell? Bones! Easy! What
the hell are you doing? Bones!

02:18.640 --> 02:21.200
Bones, you don'tjust run
after guys in the dark.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.989
He didn't need any light. He
knew exactly where he was going.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.719
Yeah, that's creepy.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.995
He lives down here.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074

03:02.560 --> 03:07.680
The victim had a pin in her knee from a
skiing injury so we matched the seriaI numbers.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.638
Her name's Marni Hunter, 24.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.359
1.7 metres tall. Left-handed.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.716
- Documentary filmmaker.
- Reported missing ten days ago.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.678
- Police find the guy?
- Your mole man? No.

03:19.760 --> 03:24.675
I've heard of them. They patch into electricaI
grids down there. Some can even tap cable.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.751
I'd set time of death at ten days,

03:26.840 --> 03:29.434
- when the missing persons report was filed.
- Sure?

03:29.520 --> 03:32.478
See the ratio of fly
larvae to Silphidae beetles?

03:32.560 --> 03:34.152
Ten days. I believe you.

03:34.240 --> 03:39.030
She fell approximately 40 feet and landed
feet first, which explains the crushed tibias.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.190
- That what killed her?
- Not necessarily.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.159
Her skull sustained traumatic injuries
inconsistent with a feet-first fall.

03:45.240 --> 03:50.519
We found blood and bone chips on exposed
pipes jutting from the ventilation shaft.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.751
- So that's what killed her?
- No, not necessarily.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.592
The fingernails are clean.

03:55.680 --> 04:00.231
If she were falling, she would claw at the
wall to slow her descent. It's instinctuaI.

04:00.320 --> 04:04.359
- So she was dead before the fall.
- No, not necessarily.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.671
Bones, please. Just tell me.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.593
She may have simply been unconscious.

04:16.880 --> 04:22.716
Mr Garfield, why did you wait two days to file
the missing persons report on your fiancÃ©e?

04:22.800 --> 04:26.270
Marni is a documentary filmmaker. Was.

04:26.360 --> 04:29.272
Very dedicated
- she immersed herself in each project.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.875
It's not odd for her to stay out
in the field without coming home.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.838
You get invested in your work,
time can get away from you.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.593
<i>That's what Marni always said.</i>

04:38.680 --> 04:42.229
- You didn't worry about her down there?
- She's been all over the world.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.915
Rwanda, Latin America, the
Balkans, the Middle East.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.073
- I was just glad to have her home.
- You two were engaged.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.711
- We'd finally set a date.
- I'm very sorry for your loss.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.870
Did her work take her into the tunnels?

04:56.960 --> 05:02.671
Her latest project, the last couple of months,
is about the maze of tunnels beneath the city.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.399
That's what she'd cut together so far.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.999
<i>- Y ou need to drink...
- I told her to be carefuI.</i>

05:09.080 --> 05:11.514
A lot of those guys are pretty nuts.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.559
It's fascinating. A fully
functionaI shadow society.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.915
Did you ever go down there with her?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.719
- Who did she work with?
- Marni worked alone.

05:20.800 --> 05:24.793
She did her own camerawork and sound. It's very raw
- that's her style.

05:24.880 --> 05:29.874
She never appeared on camera. She thought
the film should be about the subject, not her.

05:29.960 --> 05:33.475
That's true. As an anthropologist
you immerse yourself in a culture

05:33.560 --> 05:36.711
without distorting it
with your own presence.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.758
It's another reason to work alone.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.912
So you found her at the
bottom of an air shaft?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.991
You think one of these people...?

05:45.080 --> 05:47.719
Her skull has unexplained
damage. Shattering on...

05:47.800 --> 05:51.713
<i>We're still investigating, Mr Garfield.</i>

05:56.440 --> 06:00.638
<i>- Hey, Harold.
- Hey, Helen. What you doing down here?</i>

06:00.720 --> 06:03.075
Wait a minute.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.196
Wait. Freeze!

06:05.920 --> 06:07.990
That's the man I saw in the tunneI.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.389
Marni ever mention this guy to you?

06:10.480 --> 06:14.792
No. The blonde woman
is Helen... something.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.075
She's a sociaI worker, I think.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.071
Runs a shelter over on 26th.

06:19.400 --> 06:23.439
Marni came to the shelter. She heard I
worked with what she called "mole people".

06:23.520 --> 06:25.750
She asked me to introduce her to them.

06:25.840 --> 06:29.799
- Spend a lot of time down here?
- It's kinda my beat, I guess you'd say.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.314
- Did you resent her intrusion?
- Why do you ask?

06:32.400 --> 06:36.188
It's an ordered society. Marni and
her cameras might've been disruptive.

06:36.280 --> 06:41.308
These people are here for a reason. They
have a right to privacy. I respect that.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.517
I'm not sure a
documentary filmmaker does.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.832
- Disruptive enough to make enemies?
- Perhaps. It's tough to know these people.

06:48.920 --> 06:53.277
Isn't that what Marni was trying to do?
Get to know them, explain them to the world?

06:53.360 --> 06:56.272
No offence, Dr Brennan,
but I find that a bit naive.

06:56.360 --> 07:00.069
Herjob was to sell her films.
What she was doing was exploitive.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.277
Maybe one of these
people'd agree with you.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.272
There's the man you're
looking for. Harold Overmeyer.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.749
Marni called him the Mayor of Moletown.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.115
I imagine she thought that was clever.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.749
<i>He's mediating a dispute.
He has alpha-male status.</i>

07:15.840 --> 07:19.594
- How did Harold respond to her?
- My impression was he liked her.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.639
But, again, nobody
really knows these people.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.232
I brought you some food, Harold.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.113
I have enough food.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.074
- What do you want?
- I'd like to ask a few questions.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.755
I'm not required to answer
any questions. Not required.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.877
That's correct. Harold has rights.

07:48.960 --> 07:55.149
Miss, do you wanna step back? You're
interfering with a criminaI investigation.

07:56.520 --> 07:59.432
Did you know Marni Hunter?

08:03.960 --> 08:08.078
- You saw what happened, didn't you?
- You guys are trespassing. Go away.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.596
- OK, buddy, that's it. Let's go.
- Whoa, whoa. Booth.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.989
This man is obviously someone important.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.913
Important? He lives in a
cardboard box underground.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.470
<i>In this society he has
status. Give him his due.</i>

08:20.560 --> 08:23.154
Treat him with respect.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.918
OK, Mr Overmeyer, we got
off on the wrong foot.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.912
I'm SpeciaI Agent Seeley
Booth from the FBI.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.073
I would appreciate it very much if you would
grant us the advantage of your expertise

08:36.159 --> 08:38.469
as we investigate Marni Hunter's death.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.796
Fair enough.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.269
Oh.

08:44.360 --> 08:49.957
Mr Overmeyer, I saw you in the tunneI
near where we found Marni Hunter's remains.

08:50.040 --> 08:55.398
- Checking the tunnels.
- Checking the tunnels or checking on Marni?

08:55.480 --> 08:57.152
I warned her.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.789
So you two were friends beyond
being observer and observed?

09:00.880 --> 09:03.394
You talk like her. You
making a documentary too?

09:03.480 --> 09:06.950
- No, but there are things we need to...
- That's my stuff.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.678
Bones.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.513
Harold, is this Marni's video camera?

09:13.400 --> 09:16.073
You'd better go now. You can go now!

09:16.160 --> 09:18.674
Booth, this clothing
has blood all over it.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.832
- "Give him his due", huh?
- I think it belonged to Marni.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.115
Afraid you're gonna
have to come with us.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.475
What? No! I can't leave.

09:26.560 --> 09:30.075
There are bone fragments. I'm
gonna take these back to the lab.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.435
No! You don't understand!

09:32.520 --> 09:35.876
She wanted me to have it.
She wanted me to have that!

09:38.520 --> 09:42.479
I find scrap metaI, that's
all. That's why I go deep.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.835
You don't have to say anything.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.639
You're not here because
you scavenge. You know that.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.030
It's too bright in here.
Too... too bright in here.

09:51.120 --> 09:55.910
I know you have a distinguished military
record, Harold. 10th SpeciaI Forces Group.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.797
I was with the Rangers.

09:57.880 --> 10:02.874
What, so you gonna tell me, "Harold, I know
what you've been through. I been there too. "

10:02.960 --> 10:05.155
"I know how you ended
up how you ended up. "

10:05.240 --> 10:09.074
- You telling me that?
- Yeah, I'm telling you that.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.117
- I killed people.
- You saved five of your men.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.190
- By shooting a pregnant woman.
- She had a grenade in her hand.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.272
She had a child in her arms.

10:22.720 --> 10:26.429
I shot her... and the grenade went off.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.357
She died right away.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.071
But that kid...

10:36.040 --> 10:38.156
He took a while.

10:38.240 --> 10:42.438
He kept looking at me, but I...

10:42.520 --> 10:45.478
You did what a soldier had to do.

10:45.560 --> 10:49.838
Yeah. You know, I was a good
soldier. I was a very good soldier.

10:49.920 --> 10:53.356
But a pretty bad human being.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.510
A pretty bad human being.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.109
What happened to Marni?

11:00.760 --> 11:04.036
Ah. I hadn't seen her in days, you know?

11:04.880 --> 11:07.189
That's why I went to go take a look.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.834
Rats were all over her, man.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.150
All over her!

11:13.240 --> 11:17.074
- How did you end up with her things?
- Well, I was gonna sell them.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.594
She would've wanted me to have those.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.877
So you had nothing to do with her death?

11:26.320 --> 11:28.197
Um...

11:28.280 --> 11:30.589
I
- I gave her something.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.717
- And that's why she died.
- What did you give her?

11:33.800 --> 11:36.075
I'm advising you not
to say anything else.

11:36.160 --> 11:39.630
You know what? I think it's best
I not talk about this any more,

11:39.720 --> 11:41.392
not cause any more trouble.

11:41.480 --> 11:44.074
- I gotta go.
- No, Harold, you can't. Not yet.

11:44.160 --> 11:47.152
- It's too bright in here. I gotta go.
- Harold...

11:50.400 --> 11:52.391
I never wanted her to die.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.597
But she wouldn't listen. I warned her.

12:50.640 --> 12:54.474
I finished the skull. We should be
able to determine cause of death.

12:54.560 --> 12:59.998
You haven't eaten all day. I have some
killer yellowtaiI here and spicy tuna rolls.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.310
Time gets away from me sometimes.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.754
- What?
- The victim used to say that.

13:05.840 --> 13:09.549
- You think the homeless mole guy killed her?
- Booth does.

13:09.640 --> 13:13.155
He had her camera and bloody clothes.
Plus he's killed people before.

13:13.240 --> 13:17.119
- As a soldier. Socially sanctioned.
- Booth's killed as a law enforcer.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.590
What if, from mole man's point
of view, Marni was a criminaI?

13:20.680 --> 13:23.877
Marni Hunter was an observer.
By definition, passive.

13:24.640 --> 13:27.712
- Like you?
- Yes. Exactly.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.798
Are you getting at something?

13:30.880 --> 13:35.670
- I just wish you were a little more scared.
- I'm carefuI.

13:35.760 --> 13:39.514
<i>Running after a murderer in the
dark is not being an observer.</i>

13:39.600 --> 13:40.999
Booth told you?

13:41.080 --> 13:46.313
More and more of your work is outside
of this lab, running after bad guys.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.550
Just promise me you'll be carefuI.

13:48.640 --> 13:53.919
Every society has its fringe dwellers, and
every society fears its fringe dwellers.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.039
Usually cos they're an example of what
happens when you faiI in that society.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.032
But they are seldom
dangerous, in reality.

14:01.120 --> 14:04.237
This is what you do when
things get too close to home -

14:04.320 --> 14:06.470
you get all analyticaI and academic.

14:06.560 --> 14:10.439
I just want you to know that maybe
Marni Hunter did the same thing,

14:10.520 --> 14:13.114
and now she's dead.

14:17.240 --> 14:21.279
We've got most of the skull. There's just
a piece missing the size of a quarter.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.033
Why are missing pieces
always the size of quarters

14:24.120 --> 14:26.395
and tumours always the
size of grapefruits?

14:26.480 --> 14:30.234
Those are rhetoricaI questions
I'm not supposed to answer, right?

14:30.320 --> 14:33.915
- These are not simply random abrasions.
- What are they?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.639
Marni's skull was fractured
by a midair impact.

14:36.720 --> 14:40.349
There's a radiating fracture centred
above her right temporaI bone.

14:40.440 --> 14:44.035
<i>But this damage is isolated
on the left side of her skull.</i>

14:44.120 --> 14:47.396
A girI can't bang both sides of
her head as she falls down a shaft?

14:47.480 --> 14:52.110
From the fracture pattern, it
appears to be a sharp, pointed weapon.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.954
Harold said he'd given the victim
something he wished he hadn't.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.315
Could this have been it?

14:58.400 --> 15:01.676
<i>- Fragments of Latin.
- Roman numerals.</i>

15:01.760 --> 15:04.911
- You know who knows about that stuff?
- You show it to him.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.879
<i>I am not taking possession of that
piece of evidence. Y ou show it to him.</i>

15:10.280 --> 15:15.912
Armour. Roman cuirass. Doric columns,
common around the first century BC.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.436
The mole guy gave something to the
victim he thinks got her killed.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.078
Of course, he's crazy.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.755
This could be valuable. Let's
have Miss Montenegro x-ray it.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.719
Stress from the initiaI pressing
should show what's been worn away.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.872
I was hoping you'd take possession
of this piece of evidence.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.474
And the paperwork that
goes along with it?

15:34.560 --> 15:37.677
I wasn't born yesterday, Dr Hodgins.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.073
You don't need me for this.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.639
- Yes, I do.
- Why?

15:45.720 --> 15:48.837
I have not taken officiaI
possession of this evidence.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.229
Fascinating.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.197
1778.

15:53.280 --> 15:56.556
It appears to be an
officiaI seaI of some kind.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.196
Oh, my God.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.228
- Aren't you gonna go after him?
- Nope.

16:08.320 --> 16:12.074
- Why not?
- He's now in charge of that medallion.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.435
Yes!

16:14.520 --> 16:17.671
- Treasure?
- It's an officiaI vault seaI.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.070
Manufactured by the War Office.
It was established in 1778.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.879
<i>The Latin sigli and thesaur
tie it to the Treasury.</i>

16:23.960 --> 16:26.520
- A bank vault kind of a vault?
- Much better.

16:26.600 --> 16:31.151
The War Office established severaI vaults
under the city to safekeep culturaI treasures.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.071
- They must all be empty by now.
- No.

16:33.160 --> 16:37.358
SeveraI were unaccounted for after a
series of cave-ins in the early 1900s.

16:37.440 --> 16:40.557
So this seaI came off a vault
of treasure beneath the city?

16:40.640 --> 16:45.156
It could contain currency, gold
ingots, paintings and engravings.

16:45.240 --> 16:48.437
The originaI draft of
Lincoln's inauguraI address.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.590
This could be an extraordinary find.

16:50.680 --> 16:54.958
We have to find these artefacts
before they're stolen or sold off.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.077
- What's the monetary value of this thing?
- Priceless.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.276
You can't put a value on our heritage.

17:00.360 --> 17:04.319
Well, I think someone did.
That's why Marni's dead.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.439
Harold, is this what
you gave Marni Hunter?

17:12.520 --> 17:15.079
Yeah. She liked it.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.674
Where'd you get it?

17:17.760 --> 17:20.069
Beyond the perimeter.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.434
Harold?

17:21.520 --> 17:23.431
Harold, you have to trust us.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.398
We just want to find who
killed Marni. And you can help.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.714
You killed people.

17:33.800 --> 17:37.190
Maybe this is your
chance to put that right.

17:37.280 --> 17:41.068
You said you wished you
hadn't given it to her. Why?

17:41.160 --> 17:43.879
- Did you take it from someone?
- The blonde.

17:44.320 --> 17:48.518
- It was hers, and I shouldn't have taken it.
- A blonde killed Marni?

17:48.600 --> 17:52.832
Marni went too deep. That's
the blonde's territory.

17:52.920 --> 17:57.516
- Does the blonde woman have a name?
- People around me die.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.034
- Marni died.
- There'll always be casualties.

18:00.120 --> 18:05.353
What's important is to recognise the enemy
and take 'em out so more people aren't hurt.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.629
- Can you take us down there, Harold?
- No. It's beyond the perimeter.

18:09.720 --> 18:13.474
I took Marni beyond the perimeter.
I won't make that same mistake again.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.199
I won't make that mistake again.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.597
- The sociaI worker.
- Why? Because she's a blonde?

18:24.680 --> 18:27.069
Why didn't she want Marni poking around?

18:27.160 --> 18:30.232
She thought the documentary
was exploiting the homeless.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.390
- You buy that?
- Obviously you don't.

18:32.480 --> 18:36.234
You wanna know a better reason for
not wanting someone poking around?

18:36.320 --> 18:39.517
<i>- A mythicaI treasure?
- Ever see Treasure of the Sierra Madre?</i>

18:39.600 --> 18:45.436
It doesn't matter if the treasure is mythicaI.
People will still kill if they think it exists.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.238
- It did exist.
- What?

18:47.320 --> 18:52.269
In the movie, it's gold dust. People think it
didn't exist, so it blew away. But it did exist.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.794
But no one got it, is the point.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.271
All of a sudden, you know a movie.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.954
<i>Everybody knows that movie.</i>

19:00.040 --> 19:01.598
<i>- Brennan.
- It's Hodgins.</i>

19:01.680 --> 19:04.319
Your victim was in some
other tunneI before she died.

19:04.400 --> 19:08.234
<i>- Facts before conclusions.
- Her clothing shows traces of diamond dust.</i>

19:08.320 --> 19:11.437
That suggests a much
older system of tunnels.

19:11.520 --> 19:15.433
IndustriaI diamonds were used in
blast-hole drilling in the 19th century.

19:15.520 --> 19:19.149
Hm. It's near a vault. It makes sense.

19:20.400 --> 19:24.393
"Good job, Hodgins. What
would we do without you?"

19:24.480 --> 19:29.634
So Marni was killed near a vault
and then dragged to the shaft.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.676
Harold will know where that vault is.

19:31.760 --> 19:35.196
Maybe you could try the "We're
brothers-in-arms" thing on him.

19:35.280 --> 19:40.752
OK, that what you just said right there, Bones,
that was cynicaI. It was glib and cynicaI.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.796
- Really?
- Yes, really.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.519
I know what that guy has been through.

19:46.640 --> 19:50.553
You killed a pregnant woman
who was holding a child?

19:52.400 --> 19:57.599
If you really want to know what I've done,
I'll tell you. But be ready for the truth.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.953
Good choice, Bones.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.674
- Harold is afraid of me?
- Does he have any reason?

20:11.760 --> 20:14.433
He fears the world. Why else
does he live underground?

20:14.520 --> 20:16.238
- He's paying penance.
- What?

20:16.320 --> 20:19.869
You catch murderers to pay your
penance, Harold lives underground.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.838
Did you ever tell Marni you
found her film exploitative?

20:22.920 --> 20:25.514
Of course. I'm honest. I
told her I wouldn't help.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.592
- So she turned to Harold as a guide.
- And two other guys.

20:28.680 --> 20:32.798
- What two other guys?
- She took climbing lessons, all that stuff.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.758
When you told Marni she was
exploitive, how did she react?

20:35.840 --> 20:39.116
She said that showing the
truth couldn't be exploitive.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.269
I agree with her.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.715
Truth doesn't mean the
same thing to everyone.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.519
- Harold said he was afraid of me?
- Of a blonde.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.433
- How do you know it wasn't Charlize Theron?
- Who's that?

20:48.520 --> 20:51.796
An actress. She's being
sarcastic. Thank you for your help.

20:51.880 --> 20:56.317
<i>You amaze me. You know Treasure of the
Sierra Madre but not Charlize Theron.</i>

20:56.400 --> 20:59.915
You know who you are?
You're my grandmother.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.760
OK. Here's the recreation.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.195
Here are the wounds.

21:17.280 --> 21:22.434
Those skull fractures are centred
above the left parietaI lobe.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.838
OK, the lasers can measure
the angle of the attack

21:26.920 --> 21:30.071
and the amount of damage done
to the living bone of the skull.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.914
3.3mm indentation into the
bone at the deepest point,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.639
which trailed off to 0.04mm.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.514
<i>A glancing blow.</i>

21:40.560 --> 21:43.028
Yeah. She saw it coming.

21:43.120 --> 21:46.669
The angle of attack was
between 50 and 53 degrees.

21:46.760 --> 21:50.150
Meaning the attacker struck from above.

21:51.480 --> 21:55.439
- And from the victim's right. -
So the attacker was left-handed.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.115
She was only struck once.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.078
Sometimes that's all it takes.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.273
Good job, bro. Take care.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.238
- Kyle Montrose and Duke DallieI?
- Yeah.

22:12.320 --> 22:13.992
We're from the FBI.

22:14.080 --> 22:18.198
We have credit-card receipts showing
you gave Marni Hunter climbing lessons.

22:18.280 --> 22:22.910
<i>If anyone can talk the FBI into
getting her a refund, it's Marni.</i>

22:23.000 --> 22:25.560
She's dead.

22:25.640 --> 22:28.473
- What? Oh, my God.
- What happened?

22:28.560 --> 22:31.279
She was found in a ventilation
shaft beneath the city.

22:31.360 --> 22:33.271
Did... did she fall?

22:33.360 --> 22:35.920
We told her not to go down
there. It's too dangerous.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.879
Marni's dead? That's... God.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.679
We gave her some climbing
lessons - rappelling -

22:42.760 --> 22:45.558
but not enough for her to
do spelunking on her own.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.517
Did you ever go into the tunnels?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.831
No way. The whole point of rock
climbing is to head for the sky.

22:50.920 --> 22:53.480
- Did she ever ask you to?
- Yes. Yes, she did.

22:53.560 --> 22:56.836
She was doing some sort
of documentary and...

22:56.920 --> 22:59.957
- God. She fell?
- That's what we're investigating.

23:00.040 --> 23:03.157
- You seem shook up.
- Well, yeah. Someone you know dies...

23:03.240 --> 23:08.075
I'm sorry, sir, but I gotta ask.
Were you and Marni... intimate?

23:08.160 --> 23:11.152
Yeah, we had a thing, but we broke up.

23:12.080 --> 23:17.518
She had a fiancÃ©, and I was always very
clear that I didn't want to marry anyone.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.592
But... I liked her.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.630
God, it's just terrible.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.473
Did her fiancÃ© know about you?

23:27.560 --> 23:30.074
I don't know.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.879
I can't believe this.

23:36.760 --> 23:42.312
Yes, I was aware there was another
guy. Marni was never sneaky.

23:42.400 --> 23:47.235
<i>- Did you know who it was?
- No. She told me it was over.</i>

23:47.320 --> 23:50.551
Romantic triangle. Makes for
a pretty compelling motive.

23:50.640 --> 23:55.191
- You mean for me? I didn't kill Marni.
- She was sleeping with another man.

23:55.280 --> 23:58.636
Why didn't you tell us that
your wedding was called off?

23:58.720 --> 24:01.553
- Because it's humiliating.
- It make you angry?

24:01.640 --> 24:06.191
Of course it made me angry. And depressed,
and made me question my manhood. All that.

24:06.280 --> 24:10.034
What do you want from
me? I didn't kill Marni.

24:10.880 --> 24:15.476
- She always came back to me.
- So this wasn't the first time?

24:15.560 --> 24:16.788
No.

24:16.880 --> 24:20.350
The fact that she was sleeping
around is gonna make it tougher.

24:20.440 --> 24:23.716
- Why?
- MythicaI treasure versus jealous men?

24:23.800 --> 24:25.756
- That's stupid.
- No, it's not.

24:25.840 --> 24:29.037
Jealousy is the oldest motive
for murder in the world.

24:29.120 --> 24:33.238
A man getting involved with Marni should
know she's adventurous and independent.

24:33.320 --> 24:36.039
Horrible coffee. Yeah,
with a cheating heart?

24:36.120 --> 24:39.715
Well, she didn't hide anything.
She was direct and honest.

24:39.800 --> 24:43.315
Bones, you do realise you are
discussing motive right now?

24:43.400 --> 24:46.437
Psychology, not hard evidence.

24:46.520 --> 24:49.114
It won't happen again.

24:51.560 --> 24:55.235
We really need you to show
us where you got this, Harold.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.310
It's only safe on this
side of the perimeter.

24:58.400 --> 25:02.518
Then just take us to the perimeter
and you point the rest of the way.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.669
No.

25:03.760 --> 25:08.356
Harold, those people you
live with, they depend on you.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.190
What about them?

25:11.280 --> 25:14.113
It's up to you to keep them safe.

25:16.720 --> 25:20.235
You know, you don't have to live
down here. There are alternatives.

25:20.320 --> 25:22.390
No, not for me.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.193
You're hiding. You have
to face your demons.

25:26.280 --> 25:32.310
Living here, this is the only way I can pay so
I won't have to go to hell for what I've done.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.868
There are programmes
that help people like you.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.837
- "People like me"?
- Mentally ill.

25:36.920 --> 25:40.913
Bones, simmer down. You might want to
just sidle up to the issue a little easier.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.120
I like it. Someone's honest, says
the truth. You don't lie, I guess.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.351
No, I don't lie. Agent Booth
and I would be glad to help you.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.908
- This is as far as I go.
- It doesn't have to be that way.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.231
He means it's the perimeter. This
is as far as he agreed to take us.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.118
Beyond this, it's not safe.

25:58.200 --> 26:02.512
<i>OK, how much farther to
where you found the medallion?</i>

26:02.600 --> 26:06.115
- You'll see. It's down there.
- You stay here.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.998
Between one soldier to
another, you got my back?

26:09.080 --> 26:11.469
I never left my men.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.949
Cave-in. Dead end. We came all
the way down here for nothing.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.749
Not quite.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.555
This is a very old skeleton.

27:01.640 --> 27:03.790
Male, mid-30s.

27:03.880 --> 27:06.678
There's no clothing because
it simply rotted away.

27:06.760 --> 27:09.513
Buttons. Bone for the
shirt, pewter for the pants.

27:09.600 --> 27:14.230
Brass eyelets for the boots, a belt buckle
- also pewter.

27:14.320 --> 27:18.518
This is a half-inch button from
the Union Army Corps of Engineers.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.318
By Union Army, you mean...

27:20.400 --> 27:21.992
<i>CiviI War.</i>

27:22.080 --> 27:25.550
Plus the fact that Hodgins found
diamond dust on this skeleton too,

27:25.640 --> 27:29.076
I think Marni Hunter was killed
in a CiviI War-era tunneI.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.958
These pellets are
commonly known as birdshot.

27:32.040 --> 27:35.874
Pellet size 12, 0.73 inches
in diameter, made of lead.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.473
Also CiviI War vintage.

27:37.560 --> 27:42.429
The spread pattern suggests not a shotgun
but a muzzle-loaded pistoI like a LeMat.

27:42.520 --> 27:46.195
- If you don't mind some conjecture.
- You're the boss.

27:46.280 --> 27:49.192
This fellow knew where
something of value was stored.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.999
Came down with an accomplice.

27:52.440 --> 27:56.638
I apologise. I've been hanging
around Booth way too much.

27:56.720 --> 27:59.553
It's a valid hypothesis.
No doubt one of many.

27:59.640 --> 28:02.234
They argued. One killed
the other for the treasure.

28:02.320 --> 28:06.074
Doesn't that mean the vault
will be empty when we find it?

28:06.160 --> 28:08.116
Oh, my God. They got me too.

28:08.200 --> 28:12.637
If the vault had been looted years ago, the
artefacts would've surfaced, been sold off.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.312
It must still be down there.

28:14.400 --> 28:18.473
I'll pull all the city plans from
the mid-19th century to the present.

28:18.560 --> 28:22.439
We have to save what we can. Is there any
way to discover who these bastards are?

28:22.520 --> 28:25.273
Zack, take a cast of
Marni Hunter's skull.

28:25.360 --> 28:28.272
See if we can be specific
about the murder weapon.

28:31.320 --> 28:34.153
Harold could give you enough
for a sketch of the blonde.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.550
You said he was suspicious. What
if I can't get him to trust me?

28:37.640 --> 28:41.918
- You're nervous.
- I'm not nervous. I'm scared.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.436
I don't know how to talk to crazy
people. Unless I'm dating them.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.988
I'm not sure he's
actually clinically insane.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.833
I don't know how to talk to
people who live underground

28:50.920 --> 28:53.309
and who might've tossed
a filmmaker down a hole.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.198
Just be honest with him, Ange.

28:56.280 --> 28:59.955
Treat him with respect.
You're good at that.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.188
You're scared of me.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.589
- Yes.
- Why?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.875
You live underground.

29:18.680 --> 29:21.592
Yes. I find it very bright up here.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.956
How does this work?

29:48.040 --> 29:49.632
Um...

29:49.720 --> 29:53.030
You tell me what the blonde
looks like and I draw her.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.236
Like, height, weight, hair colour?

29:55.320 --> 29:58.232
Yeah, yeah, but... more.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.030
More?

30:01.120 --> 30:03.395
Yes. You know, how she seemed to you.

30:03.960 --> 30:07.475
You know, your, uh... your impressions.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.669
Her eyes are dead.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.991
She sees you and
doesn't at the same time.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.310
- You mean like that?
- Yeah.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.236
Her mouth was small.

30:24.240 --> 30:28.518
Stern. Little... lip line.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.878
Mould filled in the missing
sections of the skull.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.669
It shows the entry point of the
injury has a very distinctive shape.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.194
Enlarge the image.

30:43.400 --> 30:47.996
It's a T. It's not a knife or
a hammer that I've seen before.

30:48.080 --> 30:52.073
Make a list of possible implements
using the size and force of the damage.

30:52.920 --> 30:56.037
Marni's fiancÃ© found some raw
footage of her documentary.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.315
<i>A dark labyrinth.</i>

30:58.400 --> 31:01.153
<i>A warren of tunnels and fissures,</i>

31:01.240 --> 31:04.789
<i>forgotten coal cellars,
sewer lines, storm drains,</i>

31:04.880 --> 31:09.317
<i>subbasements, access shafts,
easements and crawlspaces -</i>

31:09.400 --> 31:12.312
<i>some as old as the city itself.</i>

31:12.400 --> 31:15.870
Bones... I thought she worked alone.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.155
Who's running the camera?

31:18.240 --> 31:22.358
<i>.. shelter, for a place to hide
from the evils of the world.</i>

31:22.880 --> 31:25.440
<i>Others are looking for treasure.</i>

31:25.520 --> 31:28.432
She might've started out
to make a documentary,

31:28.520 --> 31:31.956
but she wound up using Harold
so she could loot the treasure.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.759
Doesn't mean she deserves to die.

31:34.840 --> 31:36.717
<i>And who are these treasure hunters?</i>

31:36.800 --> 31:40.315
<i>Not the homeless, who
scrounge for bits of metal.</i>

31:40.400 --> 31:42.197
<i>Some are Civil War enthusiasts...</i>

31:42.280 --> 31:46.831
<i>And some are remarkably
handsome adventurers!</i>

31:47.640 --> 31:50.598
<i>I... am so sorry!</i>

31:50.680 --> 31:56.198
- They said they never went underground.
- Son of a bitches lied to us.

31:59.880 --> 32:03.873
The murder weapon is a sharp-edged
instrument with a handle. Not a hatchet.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.679
Those climbers haven't been
back to their apartment.

32:06.760 --> 32:10.469
- I think the weapon was a climbing axe.
- How about this?

32:10.560 --> 32:14.712
While exploring those tunnels with Marni,
the climbers find something valuable.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.873
Marni wants to put it in her film, the
climbers want to take it for themselves.

32:18.960 --> 32:20.552
Wham on the head, down the shaft.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.598
LogicaI to think they're
there now, emptying that vault.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.514
- That was a totaI bust.
- Harold couldn't provide a description?

32:27.600 --> 32:30.956
Yeah, he provided me with
a description all right.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.031
That's the blonde Harold keeps seeing?

32:33.120 --> 32:36.635
This is what happens when you ask
for information from the mentally ill.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.711
- Where did you get that?
- I drew it.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.598
That, Miss Montenegro, is a Raeburn.

32:41.680 --> 32:45.514
Sir Henry Raeburn painted
a number of these studies.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.831
Extremely rare now. Very valuable.

32:48.920 --> 32:51.559
There.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.631
Hm. Damn, I'm good.

32:53.720 --> 32:57.599
Miss Eleanor Urquhart, painted
in 1793 by Sir Henry Raeburn.

32:57.680 --> 33:01.309
<i>Missing since 1862. Worth over $200,000.</i>

33:01.400 --> 33:04.517
If Harold saw that, he's
seen the inside of the vault.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.397
<i>- Let's go.
- Booth!</i>

33:06.480 --> 33:11.429
It's a labyrinth down there. You can't
blunder around in the dark looking for them.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.193
Maybe you won't have to.

33:14.760 --> 33:18.469
I entered modern and historicaI
plans, including shafts and tunnels,

33:18.560 --> 33:20.039
plus the newer schematics.

33:20.120 --> 33:23.908
There's also oraI accounts of
tunneI construction and passages.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.231
Wow. All that exists under the city?

33:27.320 --> 33:29.356
Yes. What we can corroborate.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.991
Good point, Bones
- you know, not rushing off to find those guys.

33:34.080 --> 33:38.232
<i>- How accurate is this?
- Blue is modern. Near 100% accurate.</i>

33:38.320 --> 33:41.153
<i>- Yellow is historicaI.
- Estimate, 80%.</i>

33:41.240 --> 33:46.519
Red represents less exact renderings from
stories, memoirs, accounts from city workers.

33:46.600 --> 33:50.559
If this treasure exists, it probably
exists in one of the red tunnels.

33:50.640 --> 33:55.077
That CiviI War victim was near the cave-in.
Maybe the treasure's on the other side.

33:55.160 --> 33:58.152
Inductive, reductive or deductive?

33:58.800 --> 34:00.756
- Deductive.
- As you wish.

34:00.840 --> 34:05.152
Miss Montenegro, please remove all tunnels
containing power, cable or utility lines.

34:05.240 --> 34:10.109
- And fibre optics.
- Yes. Also steam tunnels and transit access?

34:13.080 --> 34:15.036
What about diamond dust?

34:15.120 --> 34:17.918
You said there was diamond
dust in the old tunnels.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.629
There was also diamond
dust on the CiviI War guy.

34:21.719 --> 34:23.790
So, what? I'm not allowed to help now?

34:23.880 --> 34:27.429
- That's inductive logic.
- We agreed on deductive.

34:27.520 --> 34:31.797
Sorry. I'm just... you know,
trying to think outside your box.

34:37.320 --> 34:42.393
Can you indicate where we found Marni
Hunter's body, and the CiviI War victim?

34:42.480 --> 34:45.597
<i>Cos if Marni was killed
near the treasure and moved,</i>

34:45.679 --> 34:48.319
and CiviI War guy was
murdered by his accomplice...

34:48.400 --> 34:49.833
Mm. Gotcha.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.514
Can you connect the two bodies?

34:57.840 --> 35:00.229
This one's the closest.

35:01.160 --> 35:05.039
- There's no way to get there.
- Can you put some more blue lines back?

35:06.200 --> 35:10.671
Just a guess. Just throwing
it out there. You know, sue me.

35:12.080 --> 35:15.959
And connect where Marni
Hunter's body was found.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.600
Somewhere along that
line is the treasure.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.511
What's that blue line?

35:20.600 --> 35:22.795
Storm sewer. H15-B.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.075
The weapon was a Hank's climbing axe.

35:29.480 --> 35:31.516
This is a situation where I need a gun.

35:31.600 --> 35:35.275
We're gonna have six FBI Tac
Team members do the dirty work.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.794
We'll just watch. What's
your 20, Tac Team 3?

35:37.880 --> 35:40.997
<i>- According to this map, we're with you.
- They aren't with us.</i>

35:41.080 --> 35:44.595
I realise that, Bones.
Re-orient, Tac Team 3.

35:44.680 --> 35:47.148
<i>Suggest you wait for rendezvous, Booth.</i>

35:47.240 --> 35:49.276
Ten-four, Tac Team 3.

35:49.360 --> 35:53.319
I bet Ticktock Team is here
- two levels above us.

35:53.400 --> 35:57.757
Don't call them Ticktock Team, OK? They're
Tac Team. It's short for "tacticaI".

35:57.840 --> 36:01.230
<i>Can I just have a gun
untiI they get here?</i>

36:01.320 --> 36:05.233
Here. It's not for shooting rats.
Or psychos with climbing axes.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.390
So, what do we do? Just wait?

36:07.480 --> 36:10.392
No. We just... reconnoitre.

36:10.480 --> 36:12.550
In.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.912
Easy. Watch yourself.

36:34.640 --> 36:37.234
<i>Wow. What have we got here?</i>

36:37.320 --> 36:40.676
Tac Team 3, this is
Booth. What's your six?

36:40.760 --> 36:42.239
<i>Stand by, Booth.</i>

36:42.320 --> 36:45.596
- They're lost.
- They're not lost.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.750
What's that
- a lucky quarter?

36:54.840 --> 36:58.913
This could be the missing
piece from Marni Hunter's skull.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.513
OK.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.068
- Think she was killed here?
- It's plausible.

37:03.160 --> 37:05.469
Don't get all gushy on me.

37:05.560 --> 37:08.358
<i>- Ticktock 3.
- Did you just call us "Ticktock"?</i>

37:08.440 --> 37:11.352
Tac Team 3, stand by.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.115
Do you hear that?

37:16.120 --> 37:18.111
Yeah.

37:26.680 --> 37:29.148
That's the blonde woman.

37:32.040 --> 37:35.715
- This is locked. We gotta get in there.
- Aren't we waiting for Ticktock 3?

37:35.800 --> 37:40.510
They might not find us. If we go after them,
these guys'll go. I wanna catch 'em in the act.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.238
We can go in through here.

37:42.320 --> 37:47.189
We go in there, you are responsible for
whoever's on your left. Put your gun on him.

37:47.280 --> 37:50.829
- How'II I know whether to shoot?
- If you wonder whether to shoot, shoot.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.673
- Let you do the talking?
- I took that one for granted.

37:54.200 --> 37:58.239
<i>Maybe we should've brought bigger bags.</i>

38:01.080 --> 38:04.152
- FBI. Hands in the air.
- Yeah, hands in the air.

38:05.280 --> 38:09.034
- We're not armed.
- They don't shoot people for trespassing.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.351
They do for murder. Put
your hands on your head.

38:12.440 --> 38:15.591
- Do it.
- Murder? What murder?

38:15.680 --> 38:19.309
I'm throwing you restraints.
Put 'em on Duke. Now.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.437
- How can we climb out?
- Would you rather go out in body bags?

38:22.520 --> 38:25.353
<i>Put on the restraints!</i>

38:25.440 --> 38:28.432
- Let you do the talking. Got it.
- You think we killed Marni?

38:28.520 --> 38:32.035
- She was killed with a climbing axe.
- Duke, sit down.

38:32.120 --> 38:37.672
Bones, gimme your gun. Take the
restraints out of my belt, put 'em on Kyle.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.596
Is that cocked? Cos
where it's pointed...

38:41.680 --> 38:44.035
- You're safe.
- Killed with a climbing axe?

38:44.120 --> 38:48.238
She was gonna put this treasure in her
documentary. It would've cost you a fortune.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.073
So one of you killed
her. Who's left-handed?

38:51.160 --> 38:55.073
It's best to have this explanation
after the bad guys are incapacitated.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.230
<i>Why?</i>

38:57.320 --> 38:59.959
You killed her for this?

39:01.120 --> 39:05.591
- That's why.
- I'll try to remember that for next time.

39:18.560 --> 39:23.429
You regained one of the great culturaI finds of the century
- a glimpse of CiviI War life.

39:23.520 --> 39:26.478
Marni wanted to document
the treasure, not steaI it.

39:26.560 --> 39:29.472
So Duke killed her and threw
her down a bottomless pit.

39:29.560 --> 39:34.315
Kyle wasn't so innocent himself. He hit
Duke in the crypt with a candlestick.

39:34.400 --> 39:38.313
Kyle hit the Duke with a
candlestick in the crypt.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.039
That's very good. Very good.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.269
Right?

39:42.360 --> 39:44.476
What? What's the joke?

39:44.560 --> 39:47.313
Well...

39:47.400 --> 39:49.152
- Clue?
- What clue?

39:51.000 --> 39:53.594
- What clue?
- Unbelievable, Bones.

39:54.400 --> 39:57.278
- What's funny?
- I have no idea.

39:59.760 --> 40:02.035
Harold's being released.

40:02.680 --> 40:05.717
You found a place for him?

40:06.600 --> 40:09.160
Yes.
