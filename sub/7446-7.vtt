I can't do that, Kim.

It gives me a reason

Yeah, I'm sure I wanna do this.

Why'd you join the cops?

00:14.240 --> 00:17.000
I believe in order.
Yeah, me too.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.720

all over the streets.

JACQUI JAMES: Early 1994,
and the streets of Kings Cross

01:39.960 --> 01:42.880
erupted in another turf war
of the drug business.

01:42.880 --> 01:46.640
For years, Bill Bayeh had been
the biggest dealer in town.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.600
Now Danny 'DK' Karam

01:48.600 --> 01:52.240
decided it was time he moved over
and made room for someone else,

01:52.240 --> 01:55.320
namely Danny 'DK' Karam.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.400
Each man on the Mile
had to pick sides,

01:58.400 --> 02:01.760
although a few greedy, brave
or just plain stupid ones

02:01.760 --> 02:04.040
tried to choose both.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.032
Sooner or later,
someone was bound to get hurt.

You see?

02:28.920 --> 02:30.840
DK stabbed Samson.

Only luck of the Irish
he's still breathing.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.560

Wait, wait, wait. Russell's
working with DK? That can't be true.

Billy, he's on our payroll.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.480

02:46.480 --> 02:49.472
He's two-timing us. I want him gone.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.796

Don't I have the right to earn income?
It's a question of loyalty.

Alright, so I walk to the TAB,
no Hammer.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.640
Walk back again. Now this bloke
is lying on the ground.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.920
So I rush over, you know,
try to sit him up.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.276
There was blood coming out
the back of his head, just oozing.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.600
That's when I called an ambulance
and that's when you arrived.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.040
Do you know his name?

12:41.040 --> 12:43.918
Nup.
Driver's licence says Talal Assaad.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.800
Do you know that he sold drugs?
Nup.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.040
Was there anyone else with you?

12:50.040 --> 12:51.640
No.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.840
A witness says there was
a big guy with you.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.796
No.
Russell?

13:00.000 --> 13:03.276
Johnny, if you know anything, then
say so. Please, for your own sake.

13:09.840 --> 13:12.720
Did you miss the 'Consorting
with criminals' lecture?

13:12.720 --> 13:15.160
If he killed him, do you really
think he would've stuck around

13:15.160 --> 13:16.593
to call an ambulance and do CPR?

13:18.640 --> 13:20.200
What do you think?

13:20.200 --> 13:21.680
I think we better move fast

13:21.680 --> 13:24.560
if we wanna make sure Trevor and
his mates don't take this off us.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.840
They'll smell big bucks.
What are you talking about?

13:26.840 --> 13:28.720
How much do you think
your mate Johnny

13:28.720 --> 13:30.870
would like all of this to go away?

13:35.560 --> 13:38.840
Hello. If you are looking for the
boys, they've gone out for lunch.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.040
I would not wait.

13:41.040 --> 13:44.749
Um, no. Actually I was after you.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.240
We've got a dead body,
probably a dealer,

13:48.240 --> 13:49.958
and John Ibrahim's involved.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.920
I thought I'd handpass it to you

13:52.920 --> 13:55.160
before Chook and the boys
get their hands on it.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.120
Well, that won't make the boys happy.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.040
Mm. You up for it?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.156
I'll ride shotgun.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.360
I haven't had a suspicious
death in yonks.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.520
How much time for manslaughter?
Mate, they can't pin it on ya.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.760
There's a body in a morgue, mate.
Somebody's gotta pay.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.240
You were trying
to resuscitate him, OK?

14:13.240 --> 14:14.720
Everybody knows the rules, mate.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.640
We'll take a trip, go to Lebanon.

14:16.640 --> 14:20.000
No. No way.
And prove that I'm guilty?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.160
Yeah, right. Smart one.

14:22.160 --> 14:26.520
OK, go for Plan B...
stand your ground, stay staunch.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.000
JACQUl: But it wasn't that simple.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
A golden rule on the Golden Mile
had been broken.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.840
Talal Assaad had died
in suspicious circumstances

14:33.840 --> 14:36.479
and John Ibrahim
was the prime suspect.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.920
Most people shower and put on clean
clothes before they come to work.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.433

15:00.040 --> 15:01.520
Do you like pizza?

15:01.520 --> 15:03.875
I'd like to ram your face
in a pizza.

15:23.320 --> 15:27.080
I believe you were present
in the Springfield Mall

at approximately 1:30pm on April 21,

15:30.560 --> 15:33.560
in the company of Russell Townsend,

15:33.560 --> 15:37.280
John Ibrahim and Talal Assaad.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.040
I wasn't with them, not all of them.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.480
I was with John Ibrahim,
walking through Springfield Mall.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.880
We have witnesses
that say they saw you

15:44.880 --> 15:46.920
with John Ibrahim
AND Russell Townsend

15:46.920 --> 15:51.400
in Springfield Mall at about 1:55pm.

15:51.400 --> 15:55.080
And we've been told that the three
of you approached Talal Assaad

15:55.080 --> 15:56.680
and at the time,
Russell Townsend punched him

15:56.680 --> 15:59.080
in the right side of the face,
knocking him to the ground.

the interview room at 9:47 am.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.438
No. Everything's fine, thank you.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.240
Is there anything I can help with?

16:15.240 --> 16:18.357
Nothing you can help with.
Thank you, Sergeant.

16:29.040 --> 16:32.360
So were you with him at all that day?

16:32.360 --> 16:35.320
Yes. I was walking
down Darlinghurst Road.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.080
I met with Russell on the street.

16:37.080 --> 16:42.400
I said, "Hello. How are you?
How you doing? See you later."

16:42.400 --> 16:44.994
And after that,
I didn't see him at all.

Hey, tell me to mind
me own business,

17:12.640 --> 17:15.119
but maybe you should give the grog
a swerve for a while.

17:15.119 --> 17:17.240
Mind your own business.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.200
I just think you hit it a bit hard.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.077
Didn't you hear what I just said?

17:23.560 --> 17:25.480
Look, I'm no alkie.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.960
I just drink to keep
me mum and dad company.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.120
Oh, yeah? They hit it
a bit too, do they?

17:30.120 --> 17:33.396
Hey, don't take a swipe at me folks!
Sorry.

17:37.640 --> 17:42.280
Hey, how come the others treat you
as bad as they treat me?

17:42.280 --> 17:45.040
I don't take money.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.758
Every bastard takes money.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.920
I was with the Banking unit.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.240
There was this guy ripping off
one of the Big Four,

17:53.240 --> 17:55.040
did it all electronically.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.400
We tracked him down to the Southern
Highlands, raided the joint... bingo!

17:58.400 --> 18:00.400
There was a couple
hundred-thousand dollars in cash

18:00.400 --> 18:02.516
stashed under his bed
in a garbage bag.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.240

started talking about

18:05.240 --> 18:07.240
helping themselves to 30, 40 grand.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.800
I just said, "Count me out."

18:09.800 --> 18:11.800
Of course, that stuffed up
their party big-time

18:11.800 --> 18:14.240
'cause if I didn't take a share,
they couldn't either.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.400
Well, why didn't you?

18:16.400 --> 18:20.160
I mean, the money's only
going to go back to the bank.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.840
They wouldn't have missed
a few bucks.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.440
I'm not gonna risk
me pension, entitlements,

18:24.440 --> 18:26.320

it's gonna cost them a mill.

having drinks with these dickheads

don't leave your drink unfinished.

to dip his wick.

come back, explain it to the cops?

till the heat dies down.

to the left-hand side,

standing to the right.

into a room at Porky's

at Springfield Mall

issued by Central Local Court.

40:54.780 --> 40:58.220
This is a warrant for your arrest
for accessory to murder

40:58.220 --> 41:00.860
in that you did assist
Russell Townsend

41:00.860 --> 41:03.220
between April 21
and yesterday's date.

41:03.220 --> 41:05.340
Do you understand?

41:05.340 --> 41:06.773
Yes, I do.

41:08.340 --> 41:13.050
Sergeant, please place
John Ibrahim under arrest.

41:18.620 --> 41:21.976
As you know, I just finished
a brief stint at Fraud.

41:23.260 --> 41:26.340
I'm sorry to tell you how shocked
I am at the lack of integrity.

41:26.340 --> 41:28.260
In my view, it stops
just short of criminal.

41:28.260 --> 41:30.615
I'm shocked to hear
how shocked you are.

41:32.420 --> 41:35.700
What are you gonna do about it?
Go to IA and blow the whistle?

41:35.700 --> 41:38.180
Unfortunately,
I don't have firsthand proof.

41:38.180 --> 41:40.580
Barely had time to unpack my bags.

41:40.580 --> 41:43.820
But I have a courageous
young detective

41:43.820 --> 41:46.618
who's noted everything
in her duty book.

41:47.660 --> 41:50.413
Name?
Debbie Webb.

41:51.540 --> 41:54.338
I've signed off on all of it.

41:55.380 --> 41:58.180
I think she'd make a good witness

41:58.180 --> 42:00.819
should we, uh, decide to pursue her.

42:01.900 --> 42:05.131
(BAGPIPES PLAYS
'SCOTLAND THE BRAVE')

42:09.220 --> 42:10.940
Whoa!

42:10.940 --> 42:13.898
(ALL CHEER)

42:16.460 --> 42:17.779
Hey!

42:30.700 --> 42:32.540
G'day.
Hi.

42:32.540 --> 42:35.180
I work for John Hatton.
Do you know who he is?

42:35.180 --> 42:38.580
Yeah, a politician, keeps banging on
about police corruption.

42:38.580 --> 42:40.540
Yeah. He wants to talk to your wife.

42:40.540 --> 42:43.771
MAN: Here they go.
With the two girls. That's lovely.

42:52.460 --> 42:55.060
John Hatton. Pleased to meet you.

42:55.060 --> 42:56.700
Please stay where you are.

42:56.700 --> 42:58.700
Jason? Thank you.

42:58.700 --> 43:00.900
Well, I'm not going to beat
around the bush, Debbie.

43:00.900 --> 43:03.420
I need what you've got
on the police force.

43:03.420 --> 43:07.180
I want to get the truth out
about police corruption.

43:07.180 --> 43:09.100
Now, I've worked for 20 years

43:09.100 --> 43:11.500
to get a royal commission
into the cops

43:11.500 --> 43:15.340
and if you'll stand with me,
then we might just do it.

43:15.340 --> 43:18.220
She's six months' pregnant.
She'd be putting herself in danger.

43:18.220 --> 43:20.260
Yeah, I realise that.

43:20.260 --> 43:21.980
There are a lot of people out there

43:21.980 --> 43:25.500
who'd go to any lengths to
cover up what they've been doing.

43:25.500 --> 43:27.060
It's a big decision, Debbie.

43:27.060 --> 43:30.530
So don't rush it.
Just think about it.

43:31.580 --> 43:33.500
I don't need to.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.855
I wanna bring these bastards down.
