00:16.049 --> 00:19.352
(electronic dance music)

00:45.712 --> 00:48.448
(♪)

00:53.186 --> 00:55.021
- (Shoresy): So dumb!
- I know.

00:55.021 --> 00:56.356
Fuckin' so dumb.

00:56.356 --> 00:58.058
Delaney was at
the Coulson last night?

00:58.058 --> 00:59.492
- (Miig): Mm-hmm.
- What side?

00:59.492 --> 01:01.394
- Which fuckin' side?
- The strip club side.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.695
The strip club side.

01:02.695 --> 01:04.531
The Yanks brought
their team in a day early

01:04.531 --> 01:06.499
for a Sudbury
Saturday night game.

01:06.499 --> 01:07.967
Guess no one told them
our Friday's

01:07.967 --> 01:09.202
have a similar reputation.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.204
How do you know
he was at the rippers?

01:11.204 --> 01:12.639
'Cause I was in there too.

01:12.639 --> 01:15.542
(electronic dance music)

01:17.844 --> 01:19.479
(Ziig): He was in the VIP room
the entire night

01:19.479 --> 01:21.581
and just took his pick
and kept filling their pockets.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.616
(Shoresy): Is that what the kids
are callin' it these days?

01:23.616 --> 01:24.751
(Sanguinet): How do
you know this?

01:24.751 --> 01:26.219
(Ziig): 'Cause I was
in there too.

01:26.219 --> 01:28.521
(electronic dance music resumes)

01:29.789 --> 01:31.758
- Aren't you dating a guy now?
- I wasn't that night.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.526
Out roaming for
a canal, eh Ziig?

01:33.526 --> 01:35.462
- They closed the place down.
- Good.

01:35.462 --> 01:37.630
If he had a late one,
he won't be 100% today.

01:37.630 --> 01:38.998
Turns out the night was young.

01:38.998 --> 01:41.234
He was going to the wee hours,
going hard.

01:41.234 --> 01:42.669
Well, Delaney loves
the snooters.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.471
I don't know how he was
getting any up there

01:44.471 --> 01:46.306
- after a certain point.
- How do you know that?

01:46.306 --> 01:47.440
'Cause I was in there too.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.777
(electronic dance music resumes)

01:58.551 --> 01:59.519
(whistle blows)

01:59.519 --> 02:00.687
Get between his ears early.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.689
If he was up doin' snooters
all night,

02:02.689 --> 02:04.224
he's between his own ears.

02:04.224 --> 02:05.525
You tryin' a new scent, Ziig?

02:05.525 --> 02:07.127
- Still on me from last night.
- Hmm.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.862
You guys know how much
perfume strippers wear.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.598
- No, I don't.
- Kee-he-he-he!

02:11.598 --> 02:13.833
Yo, were the sluts with
their girls again all day?

02:13.833 --> 02:15.335
- Ask them.
- Is Michaels still

02:15.335 --> 02:16.870
- acting weird?
- Goalies are always weird.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.572
- Why are the Jims always late?
- Bangin' yer mom, Ziig!

02:19.572 --> 02:21.074
Even with the new hired guns,

02:21.074 --> 02:23.409
don't lose track of Belson,
Welson, Bilson, and Wilson.

02:23.409 --> 02:24.444
We won't.

02:24.444 --> 02:27.213
(speaking French)

02:36.923 --> 02:39.092
- Remy Nadeau!
- Oui, oui, oui.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.543
Benny et Remy Nadeau!

02:56.543 --> 02:57.810
Ay-yo!
(clears throat)

02:57.810 --> 03:00.713
Bilson à Belson,
Belson retour à Bilson,

03:00.713 --> 03:02.982
Bilson à Wilson.
Wilson à Welson.

03:02.982 --> 03:05.985
Welson de retour à Wilson,
Wilson à Benson.

03:05.985 --> 03:06.986
Oh, no, no!

03:11.758 --> 03:13.660
Et un Remy Nadeau!

03:13.660 --> 03:15.595
So, you don't think if you
put the top three American

03:15.595 --> 03:16.896
players against
the top three Canadians,

03:16.896 --> 03:18.598
- it would be close?
- Shut the fuck up, Michaels.

03:18.598 --> 03:19.832
- You're serious?
- I get it, bud,

03:19.832 --> 03:22.368
you got your first tuggy
down there playin' NCAA,

03:22.368 --> 03:24.871
but the hockey's better up here
and so are the tuggies.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.606
Okay, Matthews, Gaudreau,
and Tkachuk brothers.

03:26.606 --> 03:27.707
- Either one.
- Pick one.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.475
- No, I can't.
- Give your balls a tug.

03:29.475 --> 03:30.710
It's the same with
the Hughes brothers.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.412
- Tit fucker.
- What uh, okay,

03:32.412 --> 03:34.280
Matthews, Gaudreau, and Eichel.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.848
McDavid, MacKinnon,
and Crosby.

03:35.848 --> 03:37.650
- That'd be close!
- I didn't even say Makar

03:37.650 --> 03:38.685
and the other three might say

03:38.685 --> 03:39.886
he's better than
all three of them.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.387
Let's get goin' here, boys!
Let's go now!

03:41.387 --> 03:44.691
Wilson à Bilson à Belson
à B-Belson à D-Delson

03:44.691 --> 03:46.659
à W-Wilson, à W-B-Delson

03:46.659 --> 03:49.262
- à Ben-selonay.
- Opalye!

03:49.696 --> 03:50.997
So, how's it feel, Delaney?

03:50.997 --> 03:52.899
You did so much blow,
you're in the NOSHO.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.168
Hey, is that coke on your nose?
I'm callin' the cops.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.470
Hey, Delaney, let's get
an eight-ball put some porn on.

03:57.470 --> 03:59.706
Hey, better check your balance.
I heard you left your card

03:59.706 --> 04:01.374
in the ATM, ya fuckin' loser.

04:01.374 --> 04:03.076
- Knock it off, Shoresy.
- Schnurr!

04:03.076 --> 04:05.011
- No one's buggin' ya over here.
- Schnurr!

04:05.011 --> 04:06.679
Don't bug us,
we won't bug you.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.748
Shut the fuck up, Schnurr,
you old fuck.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.050
Hey, ya up late doin'
some of that Chuck Sheen?

04:11.050 --> 04:13.219
A little up town?
A little nose cardio?

04:13.219 --> 04:14.887
Hey, what does that
remind ya of, Delaney?

04:14.887 --> 04:16.189
Hey, what does that
remind ya of?

04:16.189 --> 04:18.157
Oh boy, it's sure great
to be able to breathe

04:18.157 --> 04:20.560
outta my nose right now,
Delaney, I gotta tell ya.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.728
I've played through
worse, Shoresy.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.096
- Shut up.
- And against better.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.230
You feel like shit.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.798
Playing guilty's
a performance enhancer.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.367
- You're still high.
- You watch.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.334
I think you're still high.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.469
Shut the fuck up, Shoresy.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.204
- Fer what?
- Shut your fuckin' mouth.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.640
- Hey, take it easy, big boy.
- You don't go near him.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.041
The cops are comin'.
Let's get outta here.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.643
- Come on, let's go!
- Fuck you!

04:36.643 --> 04:38.578
- Hurry!
- Nah, get the fuck outta here.

04:38.578 --> 04:39.746
Hey, you want this?

04:39.746 --> 04:42.482
(players shouting indistinctly)

04:42.482 --> 04:44.217
Wilson à Phil?

04:55.061 --> 04:56.129
Ooh, oh...

05:05.438 --> 05:07.307
Et Remy Nadeau!

05:07.307 --> 05:08.708
Shut up ya fuckin' goon!

05:08.708 --> 05:10.209

05:10.209 --> 05:11.944
(overlapping arguments)
I'll spear ya in the teeth

05:11.944 --> 05:14.080
before you get your gloves off.
Oh yeah? Let's fuckin' see it!

05:14.080 --> 05:15.915
- I'll fuckin' get ya!
- Hey, you like your teeth?

05:15.915 --> 05:17.150
(ref): Everyone outta here!

05:17.150 --> 05:18.951
Huh? You wanna look

05:18.951 --> 05:20.320

05:20.320 --> 05:22.555
Yeah, good luck with the Jims,

05:22.555 --> 05:24.390
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

05:24.390 --> 05:26.592
Yeah, good luck with
the Jims, ya fuckin' goon.

05:26.592 --> 05:27.927
I'll go through
the whole fuckin' team

05:27.927 --> 05:29.262
- to get to ya, Shoresy.
- Let's see it!

05:29.262 --> 05:30.830
- What're ya gonna do?
- I'll go through 'em

05:30.830 --> 05:32.298

05:32.298 --> 05:34.000

05:34.000 --> 05:35.435
I'll go through everybody!

05:35.435 --> 05:36.669
Did ya get that, Cor?

05:36.669 --> 05:37.770
(walkie-talkie beeps)
(Cory): Roger.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.072
Fuckin' eh.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.640
Hey, how'd your date
go last night, Liam?

05:40.640 --> 05:43.176
- It was good.
- Yeah? What'd ya do?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.311
We went to the theatre
at the Rainbow Centre.

05:45.311 --> 05:47.180
No, I mean what'd you do?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.648
Oh, sorry.

05:48.648 --> 05:49.982
Yeah.

05:50.983 --> 05:53.019
Frenched for a bit,
but nothin' else.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.721
Must've had
your walkie clipped

05:54.721 --> 05:56.889
to your shoulder then, eh?
(walkie-talkie beeps)

05:58.057 --> 05:59.959
- (Shoresy): Woo!
- Hey,

05:59.959 --> 06:00.993
Jims!

06:01.661 --> 06:02.962
Whudda y'at?

06:05.031 --> 06:06.432
- (loud fart)
- You know what's good

06:06.432 --> 06:07.400
in a chicken salad?

06:07.400 --> 06:08.634
I expected ya to be a bit

06:08.634 --> 06:09.769
more involved out there, Jim.

06:09.769 --> 06:10.870
Yeah.
(Shoresy): Jim.

06:10.870 --> 06:11.871
Sorry.
(Shoresy): Jim.

06:11.871 --> 06:12.805
We'll get there, Shoresy.

06:12.805 --> 06:13.873
Don't worry 'bout it, bud.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.875
- Wasabi aioli.
- All right, boys,

06:15.875 --> 06:17.977
if there's one thing
better than winning,

06:17.977 --> 06:19.579
it's beating the Yanks.

06:19.579 --> 06:20.813
And those guys across the rink,

06:20.813 --> 06:22.181
if there's one thing
worse than losing,

06:22.181 --> 06:24.217
- it's losing to Canada.
- B'ys, there's nutting

06:24.217 --> 06:25.752
for them so bad as dat.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.387
We're gettin' pretty close
to something real shiny

06:27.387 --> 06:28.755
at the finish line here, boys.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.690
And the Yanks wanna make sure
we don't get it.

06:30.690 --> 06:33.226
So, when that puck drops,
you'd better be goin',

06:33.226 --> 06:35.161
'cause you bet
the Soo Hunt will be.

06:35.161 --> 06:37.063
Well, might take Delaney
a minute to get goin'.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.031
- We gotta set the tone, boys!
- Unless he's over there

06:39.031 --> 06:41.167
- hittin' rips before the anthem!
- I've got a pretty good idea

06:41.167 --> 06:42.535
on who's settin'
the tone tonight.

06:42.535 --> 06:43.936
Who's gonna set the tone,
Sanger?

06:43.936 --> 06:46.172
- Who's gonna fuckin' set it?
- Jim, you ready?

06:46.172 --> 06:47.940
- Yeah.
- Good, 'cause you're goin'!

06:47.940 --> 06:49.842
- (team): Yaa-hoo!

06:49.842 --> 06:51.644
- Yes.
- Good, 'cause you're goin'!

06:51.644 --> 06:53.379
- (team): Yaa-hoo!
- Jim, you ready?

06:53.379 --> 06:55.114
Feelin' pretty good, Sanger.
Feelin' ready to go.

06:55.114 --> 06:56.916
Good, 'cause you're goin'!
(team): Yaa-hoo!

06:56.916 --> 06:58.751
(Sanguinet): Dolo,
ready to mix it up?

06:59.719 --> 07:01.187
Good, 'cause you're goin'!
(team): Yaa-hoo!

07:01.187 --> 07:02.722
(Sanguinet): Hitch,

07:02.722 --> 07:04.056
two points tonight?
(Hitch): Yes, sir!

07:04.056 --> 07:05.558
- (voices fading)
- Good, 'cause you're goin'!

07:05.558 --> 07:07.427
(team): Yaa-hoo!

07:09.262 --> 07:11.898
(tense rap music)

07:33.252 --> 07:34.287
(music stops)

07:34.287 --> 07:36.022
(Shoresy): Who's gonna set
the tone, boys?

07:36.022 --> 07:37.790
Who's gonna fuckin' set it?

07:39.225 --> 07:40.760
Oh, here we go!
(whistle blows)

07:40.760 --> 07:41.861
What the fuck, Jim?

07:41.861 --> 07:44.030
(players shouting indistinctly)

07:44.030 --> 07:45.598
Who's fuckin' going?

07:45.598 --> 07:47.567
Who's goin, boys? Who's goin'?

07:47.567 --> 07:48.835
Fuck's sake!

07:48.835 --> 07:50.336
(crowd jeering)

07:50.336 --> 07:52.305
- Let's go, Jim!
- Set the tone, Jimmy.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.506
Set the tone.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.141
(players cheering)

07:55.741 --> 07:57.176
Go!

07:58.411 --> 07:59.245
Fuck's sake!

07:59.245 --> 08:01.280
(crowd shouting)

08:01.280 --> 08:02.915
(players cheering)

08:07.587 --> 08:09.088
Fuck's sake!

08:10.690 --> 08:12.592
Yeah! Come on!

08:14.026 --> 08:17.029
(ref): 36 is gone, Sanguinet.
Third man in.

08:17.563 --> 08:18.831
Shoresy's line.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.867
Well, boys, better
fuckin' run 'em up.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.201
(player): Hey!

08:26.005 --> 08:27.306
(crowd cheers)

08:27.306 --> 08:29.275
(buzzer blares)

08:32.879 --> 08:34.213
(whistle blows)

08:34.213 --> 08:36.015
(horn blares)

08:37.250 --> 08:38.384
(player): Hey!

08:40.920 --> 08:42.321
(whistle blows)

08:43.923 --> 08:46.025
(buzzer blares)

08:47.593 --> 08:49.762
I'll get that fuckin'
cunt in the second.

08:49.762 --> 08:51.197
That'd be great!

08:51.197 --> 08:53.132
Well, are we just gonna be
down a goal all night, boys?

08:53.132 --> 08:55.568
Let's get ahead! Shoot the puck!

08:58.838 --> 09:00.206
(players cheering)

09:00.206 --> 09:02.241
(horn blares)

09:05.411 --> 09:06.812
(cheering)

09:06.812 --> 09:10.383
Fuck's sake! Wake the fuck up!

09:10.383 --> 09:12.885
(players cheering)

09:13.753 --> 09:15.488
(Delaney): Woo-hoo-hoo!

09:15.488 --> 09:17.657
How do you like it, Shoresy,
huh? How do you like it?

09:17.657 --> 09:19.425
(Shoresy): Shut up
ya fuckin' drunk!

09:19.425 --> 09:20.426
(Delaney): Haha!

09:20.426 --> 09:22.395
Could use a momentum
swing here, Sanger!

09:22.395 --> 09:23.663
(Sanguinet): Jims' line.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.331
Run 'em up
and fill 'em in, boys.

09:25.331 --> 09:28.434
Let's fuckin' go!
Holy fuck, Goody, Dolo,

09:28.434 --> 09:30.369
if I spray the puck
with Melodie's perfume,

09:30.369 --> 09:32.438
you think you'd go
after it a little harder?

09:33.205 --> 09:35.575
Fuck, Fish, are you ever
gonna score again?

09:35.575 --> 09:39.612
I'm startin' to think you'll
never score again, eh? Ever?

09:40.746 --> 09:42.081
Here we go! Here we go.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.817
Come on, Jimmy!
Jim, come on! Come on, Jimmy.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.485
- Come on, baby!
- Come on, Jimmy!

09:46.485 --> 09:47.987
- Get him!
- Here we go!

09:47.987 --> 09:49.422
- Let's go Jim.
- Come on, Jimmy!

09:49.422 --> 09:50.523
(overlapping shouting)

09:50.523 --> 09:51.657
(Shoresy): For fuck's sake.

09:51.657 --> 09:52.992
Fuck's sake.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.860
- There ya go, yeah!
- Let's go!

09:54.860 --> 09:57.363
Yeah! Fuck's sake. Fuck!

09:58.364 --> 10:00.299
(crowd murmuring)

10:06.906 --> 10:09.241
(buzzer blares)

10:11.110 --> 10:13.412
(skates thumping)

10:14.780 --> 10:16.382
Shoresy.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.451
- You okay?
- Yeah, just sometimes

10:18.451 --> 10:20.319
when I get real frustrated,
I cry a little bit.

10:20.319 --> 10:21.954
But I'm fuckin' trying not to.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.489
- Maybe just cry, my guy.
- Oh, no, no,

10:23.489 --> 10:25.191
let's do somethin'
fuckin' productive.

10:25.191 --> 10:26.559
- Behind the eight-ball here.
- Yeah, well,

10:26.559 --> 10:28.127
that's what happens when
you don't set the tone.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.129
- Jims tried to set the tone.
- They never set it.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.764
- Never got set.
- Well, ya gotta set

10:31.764 --> 10:33.132
the fucking tone!

10:33.132 --> 10:34.300
Dolo sucks tonight.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.701
Well, don't let Goody
off the hook.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.703
I don't expect them
to show up in the third either.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.271
Well, they already played
a fuckin' period between

10:39.271 --> 10:40.740
- the sheets.
- They look like shit.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.208
- They stink!
- Frankie's head

10:42.208 --> 10:43.476
- is somewhere else.
- Yeah, probably

10:43.476 --> 10:44.744
in a box of Zebra Cakes.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.045
What do you wanna do?

10:46.045 --> 10:47.680
You tell me.

10:49.048 --> 10:50.383
Let's go through
the supporting cast.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.118
- That's all we can do.
- Fish.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.286
Fish may never score
again, Sanguinet!

10:54.286 --> 10:56.756
Exactly. No use for scorers
who don't score.

10:58.257 --> 11:00.426
(arena organ chimes)

11:00.426 --> 11:02.528
Holy fuck, Jims!
What happened?

11:02.528 --> 11:04.597
I thought I'd take a few
to get inside

11:04.597 --> 11:06.432
and maybe he'd break
his hand on my head.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.833
- (loud fart)
- Lucky you didn't

11:07.833 --> 11:09.035
- get knocked out.
- How many times

11:09.035 --> 11:10.703
- have you been knocked out?
- Four or five.

11:10.703 --> 11:13.239
- That's a lot of concussions.
- Never had a concussion.

11:14.373 --> 11:16.142
Well, Fish,
ya ready to be the hero?

11:16.142 --> 11:17.309
- What?
- Huh?

11:17.309 --> 11:18.978
- You just said--
- I know what I said.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.513
You're gonna score us
a fuckin' goal.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.548
What if I don't?
(Sanguinet): You're cut.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.018
I'm cut?

11:26.018 --> 11:28.020
You used to score us
a goal a game.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.389
- How many did you get last game?
- Zero.

11:30.389 --> 11:33.893
- And the game before that?
- Zero.

11:33.893 --> 11:35.795
- And the game before that?
- Zero!

11:35.795 --> 11:37.730
No use for scorers
who don't score.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.298
(scoffs)

11:40.332 --> 11:44.403
(tense electronic music)

11:48.040 --> 11:49.742
Score us a goal, Fish.

11:49.742 --> 11:52.178
(music intensifies)

11:59.752 --> 12:02.621
(♪)

12:11.497 --> 12:13.199
(whistle blows)

12:18.204 --> 12:20.306
(crowd groans)

12:21.807 --> 12:23.676
(whistle blows)

12:26.479 --> 12:27.646
(crowd cheers)

12:27.646 --> 12:29.515
(horn blares)

12:39.225 --> 12:41.093
(Bulldogs cheer)

12:43.729 --> 12:45.498
(♪)

12:49.168 --> 12:50.870
(horn blares)

12:52.671 --> 12:54.006
(indistinct chatter)

12:54.006 --> 12:55.608
My man.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.577
Well, Fish, you scored
the game-winning goal,

12:58.577 --> 13:00.346
but your mom's real ugly.
How's it feel?

13:00.346 --> 13:02.948
Pretty big smile for
a guy who almost got cut.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.351
- That was fucked up.
- Well, didn't see you

13:05.351 --> 13:07.153
complainin' when your teammates
were mobbin' ya.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.554
- I'm serious.
- Didn't see you complainin'

13:08.554 --> 13:10.089
when the fans
were cheerin' your name.

13:10.089 --> 13:11.524
- That wasn't cool.
- Won't see you complainin'

13:11.524 --> 13:13.826
when you're gettin' your dink
sucked later tonight.

13:13.826 --> 13:14.994
Or maybe I will.

13:14.994 --> 13:16.896
What, you want me
to come watch or?

13:17.263 --> 13:19.799
Don't fuck with me
like that again.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.134
Nice game, coach.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.370
(rap music)

13:34.180 --> 13:37.316
(players cheering)

13:43.022 --> 13:44.723
I think it's pretty
fuckin' obvious.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.792
(clapping)

13:49.261 --> 13:52.431
- Shoresy.
- Call your fuckin' parents.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.334
Cunt hair away from
fucking up that record, slut.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.803
Well, they don't ask how,
they ask how many.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.605
Could do without
the suspense next time.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.807
- Ask and you shall receive.
- Kee-he-he!

14:01.807 --> 14:03.442
- You've got press.
- Yew!

14:03.442 --> 14:05.277
- Not with her.
- I was gonna say,

14:05.277 --> 14:06.445
let me grab a shower first.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.080
Got a fuckin' ecosystem
down here.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.415
- Ew!
- This guy knows

14:09.415 --> 14:11.150
- what I'm talkin' about.
- Oh, fuck you, Shoresy.

14:11.150 --> 14:14.019
It's a different
press opportunity.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.554
Well, is she hot?

14:21.060 --> 14:22.661
(quietly): Is he dying?

14:23.529 --> 14:26.465
- What?
- Is he going to die?

14:26.465 --> 14:28.267
- No.
- What's wrong with you?

14:28.267 --> 14:30.236
Well, usually when
they bring somebody in

14:30.236 --> 14:32.204
for something like this,
like a kid, it's 'cause

14:32.204 --> 14:34.306
- it's like...
- What?

14:34.306 --> 14:35.841
- His last wish.
- No!

14:35.841 --> 14:37.643
What do you think,
you're the fuckin' Rock?

14:37.643 --> 14:39.044
So, he's not dying
or anything?

14:39.044 --> 14:40.646
- No!
- You're in the fucking NOSHO,

14:40.646 --> 14:42.314
- you're a nobody.
- Then why do you got me

14:42.314 --> 14:43.849
doing an interview
with a fucking infant?

14:43.849 --> 14:44.850
- 'Cause we--
- Huh?

14:44.850 --> 14:46.418
He's not an infant.
(Nat): 'Cause we are

14:46.418 --> 14:47.953
an organization by the community
for the community

14:47.953 --> 14:50.456
and doing interviews
for his popular YouTube show

14:50.456 --> 14:51.957
will help us reach
more of our community.

14:51.957 --> 14:54.727
So, first you got us
with our dinks out in calendars,

14:54.727 --> 14:57.429
and now you want us
on a kids' show?

14:57.429 --> 14:59.632
It is a bit weird
when he puts it that way.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.500
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- Fer what?!

15:01.500 --> 15:03.068
We want more kids
out to games.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.703
- Why?
- Because kids in sports

15:04.703 --> 15:06.739
- stay off the streets.
- Drugs kill dreams.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.173
You're an idiot.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.976
(Nat): His name is Jory.
(Shoresy): What?

15:10.976 --> 15:13.979
- Jor-y.
- Jory?

15:13.979 --> 15:17.850
Yeah, like Cory but Jory.

15:17.850 --> 15:21.020
Oh, my God. So dumb.

15:22.955 --> 15:24.857
Ready? Okay.

15:26.725 --> 15:28.294
Welcome to the Sudbury Kids
Sports Report.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.628
I'm your host,
Jory Jordan and I'm here

15:29.628 --> 15:31.864
with the captain of your
Sudbury Blueberry Bulldogs.

15:32.298 --> 15:33.666
- (clicks tongue)
- What's up, buddy?

15:33.666 --> 15:36.402
- What's goin' on?
- Another win for the Bulldogs.

15:36.402 --> 15:37.770
- You bet.
- That's a good lesson

15:37.770 --> 15:39.939
for the kids at home,
you don't have to be pretty.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.942
Let's open it up
to some fan questions.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.210
This one comes from local
realtor Brandon Town.

15:45.210 --> 15:47.146
"Great job on the calendar."

15:47.146 --> 15:48.514
Thanks buddy, appreciate that.

15:48.514 --> 15:50.916
You understand that's
out there forever now?

15:50.916 --> 15:52.351
Think you'll have kids one day?

15:52.351 --> 15:54.019
Maybe you can't.

15:54.019 --> 15:55.454
If a kid came to school
and said,

15:55.454 --> 15:57.423
"Hey, look at this calendar,
it's your dad."

15:57.423 --> 15:59.191
Can't get much worse than that.

15:59.858 --> 16:02.394
Only if you got a name
like Jory Jordan.

16:03.262 --> 16:04.496
Let's go to another
fan question.

16:04.496 --> 16:05.864
There aren't any.

16:05.864 --> 16:08.767
You're not that great
at interviews. Kinda simple?

16:09.601 --> 16:11.236
They weeded out all
the simple kids from gen pop

16:11.236 --> 16:13.138
in grade 3 at my school.
What was it for you?

16:13.639 --> 16:14.940
Just a couple more
questions, Jory.

16:14.940 --> 16:17.076
Would you say getting held
back in grade 2 was worse

16:17.076 --> 16:18.544
than getting held back
in grade 1?

16:18.544 --> 16:20.446
- Alright, last one, Jory.
- Two-part question.

16:20.446 --> 16:22.414
What was it like seeing
all your friends move up a grade

16:22.414 --> 16:24.416
without you, and do you use
that as motivation today?

16:24.416 --> 16:26.352
Thanks, Nat. That was fun.

16:26.352 --> 16:27.619
Looks like that'll be all
for tonight

16:27.619 --> 16:29.054
on the Sudbury Kids
Sports Report.

16:29.054 --> 16:30.422
(Shoresy): Get big and strong, kid.

16:30.422 --> 16:32.424
You're gonna need it
if you wanna act like that.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.560
Don't take it out on me
that you can't have kids.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.028
(Nat): For fuck sakes, Shoresy.
(Shoresy): Fer what?!

16:36.028 --> 16:38.297
- What the hell was that?
- He's not even dying.

16:38.297 --> 16:39.565
I meant the game.

16:39.565 --> 16:41.633
What the one we're
on a 22-game heater after?

16:41.633 --> 16:43.335
- We sucked.
- We stink.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.837
- Frankie was somewhere else.
- He hasn't heard

16:44.837 --> 16:47.106
- from his girlfriends, my guy.
- Girlfriends?

16:47.106 --> 16:49.308
Goody and Dolo have had
their heads in mitt all day.

16:49.308 --> 16:50.376
Michaels is still
acting weird.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.111
(both): Goalies
are always weird.

16:52.111 --> 16:53.412
And what is with the Jims?

16:53.412 --> 16:54.747
Well, they didn't
set the tone.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.715
Have you ever heard
of Reach For The Top?

16:56.715 --> 16:58.050
Sanguinet, did you threaten

16:58.050 --> 16:59.418
to cut Fish if he didn't score?

16:59.418 --> 17:01.820
- Who ratted?
- It wasn't a threat.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.389
Sanguinet...

17:03.389 --> 17:05.257
- Is that true?
- You surprised?

17:05.257 --> 17:06.458
Well, didn't see him
complainin'

17:06.458 --> 17:07.793
when his teammates
were mobbin' him.

17:07.793 --> 17:09.495
- That's over the top.
- Didn't see him complainin'

17:09.495 --> 17:10.696
when the fans
were cheerin' his name.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.231
- Don't do that again.
- Won't see him

17:12.231 --> 17:14.700
complainin' when he's gettin'
his dink sucked later tonight.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.603
Or maybe I will. Fuck it,
I'll watch if he wants me to.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.438
You have multiple fires
to put out, Shoresy.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.340
Which one are you gonna
start with first?

17:21.340 --> 17:22.441
- Yeah, so--
- Never mind,

17:22.441 --> 17:24.576
I don't care. But start now.

17:24.576 --> 17:26.945
- Oh, my God!
- Go!

17:26.945 --> 17:28.747
So dumb.

17:29.815 --> 17:32.384
- Sanguinet, eh?
- Man's a killer now.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.453
I used to not like it
when he was like that.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.789
- Like what?
- Shoresy.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.757
You don't want him
anything like Shoresy.

17:38.757 --> 17:42.094
I gotta say,
he's settling into it, though.

17:42.094 --> 17:44.730
- Loves to win.
- Hates to lose.

17:45.330 --> 17:46.832
Bulldog hockey, baby.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.167
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.169
- (knocking)
- Hi.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.640
Couldn't find the arena guy.
Do you mind if I step in?

17:55.774 --> 17:57.042
Unfortunately, you got
a problem with all three

17:57.042 --> 17:58.710
shower heads in the visitors'
locker room.

17:58.710 --> 18:00.512
They're almost completely
blocked and they're leakin'

18:00.512 --> 18:01.713
where the heads meet the hose.

18:01.713 --> 18:02.948
What are you,
a fuckin' plumber?

18:02.948 --> 18:04.349
Yeah. Always wanted
to learn a trade.

18:04.349 --> 18:05.818
Better late than never.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.820
I got caught workin' late today.
Ended up takin' my truck

18:07.820 --> 18:10.689
to the game. Luckily,
I had some Teflon tape in there

18:10.689 --> 18:12.958
and I fixed the seals
where the heads meet the hose.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.828
But as for the heads themselves,
do you have any CLR?

18:17.196 --> 18:19.064
'K, great. Have your arena guy
run 'em through that

18:19.064 --> 18:21.366
for a couple minutes.
They'll be as good as new.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.703
And that's not to imply you
couldn't do this all yourself,

18:24.703 --> 18:26.538
I just figured you'd be
pretty busy

18:26.538 --> 18:28.107
running the best team
in the league and all.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.441
Soon to be the best team ever.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.977
Right. Goodnight.

18:35.681 --> 18:36.882
What a fuckin' nerd.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.550
That guy played
a thousand games in the show.

18:38.550 --> 18:39.885
Now he's in the NOSHO.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.587
That guy played with
first-ballot Hall of Famers.

18:41.587 --> 18:44.289
- Now he's a plumber.
- Everybody needs a plumber.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.425
What a fuckin' nerd.

18:46.425 --> 18:47.826
Nat.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.628
Dude, your knees are shaking.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.296
Holy shit woman,
you're fired up.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.433
I don't think
I've ever seen this.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.767
Uh-uh.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.269
(Miig): You don't date
sluts, remember?

18:57.269 --> 18:59.905
(Ziig): Yeah, you just
take them down.

18:59.905 --> 19:01.173
Uh-huh.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.041
(Miig): So...

19:04.610 --> 19:06.345
I'm gonna fuck that slut.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.847
(electronic music)
