WEBVTT

00:02.698 --> 00:04.134
Do you really
have to run off?

00:04.221 --> 00:06.180
Snuggling afterwards
is the best part.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.965
Gabriel, you can'’t own a penis
and say that.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.534
So when can I
see you again?

00:12.621 --> 00:14.927
I don'’t know, I'’m just
crazy busy these days.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.017
Fine.

00:17.104 --> 00:20.846
I'’ll just wait for you to call
and then make myself pretty.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.761
I know you'’re kidding,

00:22.848 --> 00:24.981
but it wouldn'’t hurt
to do a little manscaping.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.722
[knocking]

00:26.809 --> 00:28.245
That'’s housekeeping.

00:28.332 --> 00:29.681
Come back later!

00:29.768 --> 00:31.640
CLAUDIA:
I need to see you now, Gabriel!

00:31.727 --> 00:32.815
It'’s my wife.

00:32.902 --> 00:33.598
My boss.

00:33.685 --> 00:34.382
Hide.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.343
Get in the bathroom.

00:39.430 --> 00:40.518
What if she has to pee?

00:40.605 --> 00:41.954
You'’re right,

00:42.042 --> 00:43.782
she does like to
mark her territory.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.915
CLAUDIA:
What are you doing in there?

00:46.002 --> 00:47.612
Um, I'’m hiding
the hookers and the drugs.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.571
What do you think I'’m doing?
Quick, get in.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.094
Are you kidding me?

00:51.181 --> 00:52.574
You got a better idea?

00:52.661 --> 00:53.792
Oh, is this underwear clean?

00:53.879 --> 00:54.880
Get in!

00:54.967 --> 00:55.881
And no.

00:57.579 --> 01:00.016
Uh... uh, one minute!

01:00.103 --> 01:00.843
[knocking]

01:05.282 --> 01:07.502
Hey, what brings you by?

01:07.589 --> 01:09.895
I know this might be
difficult for you,

01:09.982 --> 01:12.159
but I need you to sign
this separation agreement.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.508
No problem. Okie dokie.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.903
Wow, I expected you
to make a scene.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.688
No scene.
Here you go. Bye!

01:19.775 --> 01:21.081
Bye.

01:22.430 --> 01:23.213
Wait a minute.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.345
What are you doing

01:24.432 --> 01:25.476
with my Louis Vuitton?

01:27.304 --> 01:29.698
Um, the maid packed
my clothes in it.

01:29.785 --> 01:31.439
I thought it was a parting gift.

01:31.526 --> 01:34.137
Well, it'’s not. I want it back.

01:34.224 --> 01:36.357
Well, uh, that'’s too bad.

01:36.444 --> 01:37.880
Possession is nine-tenths
of the...

01:37.967 --> 01:39.055
whatchamacallit, the law.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.883
The hell it is.

01:43.059 --> 01:44.582
What do you
have in here?

01:44.669 --> 01:45.670
All my self-help books.

01:45.757 --> 01:46.932
Now give it back!

01:47.019 --> 01:48.586
CLAUDIA:
Damn it, Gabriel,

01:48.673 --> 01:50.153
this is my suitcase.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.679
I'’ll return it to you when
I'’m no longer living out of it!

01:57.160 --> 01:58.422
Fine!

01:58.509 --> 01:59.728
Keep it!

02:05.299 --> 02:06.169
Oh...

02:08.170 --> 02:11.479
Oh... I am so sorry.

02:11.566 --> 02:12.784
It'’s okay.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.221
That was really close.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.139
What was that?I don'’t know.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.141
I am just really
turned on right now.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.968
Getting locked in a suitcase
does it for you?

02:23.055 --> 02:25.580
Oh, just shut up
and be grateful.

02:44.816 --> 02:46.557
Seriously? In a suitcase?

02:46.644 --> 02:47.645
Louis Vuitton.

02:47.732 --> 02:48.690
Classy.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.649
I don'’t understand it,

02:51.736 --> 02:53.521
but it was the hottest
sex we'’ve ever had.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.523
Really? Gabriel?

02:55.610 --> 02:58.178
The guy who can only do it
with his T-shirt on?

02:58.265 --> 03:01.181
He has a third nipple;
he'’s self-conscious.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.183
I get why it was hot.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.358
It'’s the danger.

03:04.445 --> 03:05.837
One time,

03:05.924 --> 03:07.404
I was running
with the Black Panthers.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.232
We knocked off a bank
in Oakland.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.323
Me and this guy Jamal
did it in the getaway car.

03:14.977 --> 03:17.284
The indelible ink
exploded all over us.

03:17.371 --> 03:20.330
My ass was blue for a month.

03:20.417 --> 03:23.638
I'’m watching a sweet old lady
put rolls in her purse,

03:23.725 --> 03:26.597
and I just can'’t get my head
around that story.

03:26.684 --> 03:29.339
That'’s nothing;
Jamal'’s a senator now.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.125
You know, Christy,

03:33.213 --> 03:35.171
that kind of sex is fine
once in a while,

03:35.258 --> 03:37.129
but, uh, with you
it'’s a little worrisome.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.175
Why?Well, honey,

03:39.262 --> 03:41.221
since I'’ve known you,
you'’ve only enjoyed sex with men

03:41.308 --> 03:42.700
when there was
an element of danger.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.485
That'’s not true.

03:44.572 --> 03:47.836
I hate to say it, but I think
old blue ass has a point.

03:47.923 --> 03:50.447
When we met, you were sleeping
with your married boss.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.797
And then the drunk,
pothead fireman.

03:52.884 --> 03:55.626
Yeah. He was fun.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.586
And then your ex-husband,
on your front lawn.

03:58.673 --> 04:01.066
It was not on
the front lawn,

04:01.153 --> 04:02.851
it was in his van.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.201
Which was technically
his house.

04:05.288 --> 04:06.985
Well, now that you'’re sober,

04:07.072 --> 04:09.988
you might want to start thinking
about finding someone

04:10.075 --> 04:12.774
you can have an honest,
intimate relationship with.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.124
Hey, I am
plenty intimate.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.168
MARJORIE:
Really?

04:16.255 --> 04:17.995
You talk and you share?

04:18.083 --> 04:19.563
You let your true self be seen?

04:20.738 --> 04:22.130
I have a true self?

04:25.743 --> 04:27.136
Intimacy, Christy.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.355
Break it down.

04:28.442 --> 04:31.488
"Into-me-see."

04:31.575 --> 04:34.143
You say that
kind of crap to Jamal?

04:36.101 --> 04:37.929
I was a heroin addict back then.

04:38.016 --> 04:40.323
I didn'’t do that much talking.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.586
Okay, I have
to go to work.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.501
Thanks for the...

04:44.588 --> 04:46.634
I don'’t know
what that was.

04:46.721 --> 04:47.765
Bye, honey.
Bye-bye.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.376
Bye.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.116
Are you gonna take
your butter patties?

04:51.203 --> 04:53.684
Help yourself.

04:53.771 --> 04:55.120
We should get the check.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.385
I almost drank last night.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.692
Go away.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.128
What?

05:03.215 --> 05:05.130
I was grocery shopping,

05:05.217 --> 05:06.915
they were handing out samples
of turkey meatballs.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.134
Next thing I know,
I'’m standing in the liquor aisle

05:09.221 --> 05:13.051
trying to decide whether to
get drunk on vodka or bourbon.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.489
Well, that bourbon pairs better
with turkey.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.797
That'’s it? No speech?

05:19.884 --> 05:22.844
Well, come on, Bonnie,
you know why this happened.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.498
It'’s about losing Alvin.

05:26.543 --> 05:29.198
I have never been
in this much pain.

05:31.635 --> 05:35.770
I go to bed thinking about him,
I wake up thinking about him...

05:35.857 --> 05:37.162
nonstop.

05:37.249 --> 05:38.599
I understand.

05:38.686 --> 05:41.123
So what do I do?

05:41.210 --> 05:44.126
You could try
getting out of your head

05:44.213 --> 05:45.780
by helping other people.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.608
Great.

05:47.695 --> 05:51.220
I'’m having a breakdown;
you'’re making jokes.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.485
Okay, that'’s all the time
we have for sharing.

05:55.572 --> 05:56.921
Before we close,

05:57.008 --> 05:58.445
we need to nominate
a new secretary

05:58.532 --> 05:59.794
to run the meeting
for the next year.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.709
I nominate Bonnie.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.101
What the hell
are you doing?

06:03.188 --> 06:04.755
This'’ll be good for you.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.757
No, I don'’t think so.I second it.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.280
What'’s happening?

06:08.368 --> 06:09.760
Any other nominations?

06:09.847 --> 06:10.892
Yeah, I, uh,

06:10.979 --> 06:13.590
nominate Weeping Wendy here.

06:13.677 --> 06:15.549
That'’s what you call me?

06:16.985 --> 06:18.769
Why?

06:18.856 --> 06:20.728
Any seconds for Wendy?

06:23.861 --> 06:25.559
[sobs]

06:25.646 --> 06:27.256
All in favor of Bonnie?

06:28.344 --> 06:29.780
Congratulations, Bonnie.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.043
You are so lucky
you have cancer.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.612
Really?

06:35.699 --> 06:37.222
You want to know
what I'’m feeling?

06:37.309 --> 06:38.963
Yeah.

06:39.050 --> 06:42.271
I don'’t want you and me
to be just about sex.

06:42.358 --> 06:44.491
I want to know
what'’s going on here.

06:46.536 --> 06:49.321
We'’ve been over this;
it'’s a third nipple.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.976
You know what I'’m talking about.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.065
Show me your true self.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.111
Oh.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.852
Wow, okay.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.027
Uh...

06:59.114 --> 07:01.072
Ever since the marriage ended,

07:01.159 --> 07:04.032
I'’ve been reevaluating
who I am and-and what I want.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.947
Mm-hmm.When you think about it,

07:06.034 --> 07:08.166
I went from my parent'’s house
to my college dorm

07:08.253 --> 07:10.342
to married
and living with Claudia.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.996
I'’ve really never
been on my own.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.390
Mm-hmm.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.348
I mean, suddenly

07:16.436 --> 07:18.002
I'’m experiencing
a level of freedom

07:18.089 --> 07:21.005
I'’ve never known,
but at the same time,

07:21.092 --> 07:23.617
I'’ve never been
more frightened.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.494
Christy?

07:31.581 --> 07:32.800
Mm-hmm.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.065
GABRIEL:
This is crazy.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.849
CHRISTY [breathy]:
I know.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.721
Right in front of
my ex-wife'’s house?
I know.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.853
You realize if she catches us,
you'’ll get fired.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.159
Oh, keep
saying that.

07:44.246 --> 07:46.074
Oh, uh... fired.

07:46.161 --> 07:48.032
You'’re...
you'’re gonna get fired.

07:48.119 --> 07:49.599
Oh, yeah.
Keep talking.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.688
Um... You'’ll lose
your 401[k].

07:51.775 --> 07:53.516
Oh, yeah.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.779
You'’ll wind up working
as a-a cafeteria lady

07:55.866 --> 07:57.912
at an inner-city school
where the kids are troubled

07:57.999 --> 07:59.348
and they don'’t appreciate
your hard work.

07:59.435 --> 08:01.002
[growls]

08:01.089 --> 08:02.003
[barks]

08:02.090 --> 08:03.526
Oh, my God!

08:03.613 --> 08:05.310
Hey! It'’s Bear!
What?

08:05.397 --> 08:06.877
It'’s my ex-dog.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.052
Oh, I miss you,
too, buddy!

08:08.139 --> 08:09.489
Who'’s a good boy?

08:09.576 --> 08:10.533
CLAUDIA:
Bear?

08:10.620 --> 08:11.926
Where are you, Bear?

08:12.013 --> 08:13.928
Oh, that'’s Claudia.
Get-get down!

08:14.015 --> 08:15.582
CLAUDIA:
Get away from that car! Bad dog!

08:15.669 --> 08:17.584
Okay, she'’s gone.

08:17.671 --> 08:18.715
Let'’s get out of here.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.021
What are you
talking about?

08:20.108 --> 08:21.675
This is hotter
than the suitcase.

08:24.547 --> 08:27.507
Anyway, it has been brought
to my attention

08:27.594 --> 08:32.554
by my sponsor, my mother
and the guy I'’m sleeping with

08:32.642 --> 08:37.081
that I may have a slight problem
with intimate relationships.

08:37.168 --> 08:40.476
And after doing a lot
of soul-searching,

08:40.563 --> 08:42.217
I realized that they'’re right.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.915
I do have a problem.

08:45.002 --> 08:48.397
But then I did
some more soul-searching

08:48.484 --> 08:50.878
and decided...

08:50.965 --> 08:52.183
I don'’t care.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.058
I'’m having fun.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.713
I'’m not drinking,
not hurting anybody.

08:59.800 --> 09:04.108
And if I'’m craving intimacy,
I can come here

09:04.195 --> 09:05.675
and open up my heart

09:05.762 --> 09:07.416
in a warm, nurturing
environment...

09:07.503 --> 09:08.765
[buzzer blares]

09:08.852 --> 09:10.506
Time'’s up.

09:14.858 --> 09:16.599
Can I at least
finish my thought?

09:16.686 --> 09:18.645
We got the gist.
Mom!

09:18.732 --> 09:20.603
I'’m sorry,
but as the new secretary,

09:20.690 --> 09:22.866
I have decided shares will now
be limited to three minutes,

09:22.953 --> 09:24.520
no exceptions, no slack.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.870
You don'’t get to decide
that by yourself.

09:26.957 --> 09:29.917
Do I have to remind you that I
won the election in a landslide?

09:31.527 --> 09:32.920
Christy'’s right.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.617
Any changes
to the meeting format

09:34.704 --> 09:36.924
have to be decided on
by everyone.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.621
Yeah, I changed
that rule, too.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.580
Okay, anyone else
want to share?

09:42.016 --> 09:43.757
Go ahead, Wendy.Thank you.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.759
Oh, just a heads up:
crying counts against your time.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.423
Mmm, what smells
so good?

09:58.510 --> 10:00.425
I'’m baking brownies
for my meeting.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.166
Oh, that'’s
thoughtful.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.690
Yeah.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.605
I figure if
we upgrade the snacks,

10:05.692 --> 10:07.781
we'’ll get a better class
of drunks and drug addicts.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.479
Maybe even some celebrities.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.568
And then, word'’ll get out,

10:12.655 --> 10:15.745
and before you know it, we'’ll be
turning people away at the door.

10:15.832 --> 10:18.226
That'’s not really the idea, Mom.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.923
Right there,
that kind of thinking

10:20.010 --> 10:21.751
is why you'’ll
never be secretary.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.274
[doorbell rings]

10:23.361 --> 10:24.536
Why don'’t I get that?

10:27.496 --> 10:30.064
Would be cool to meet
some famous drunks.

10:31.587 --> 10:32.588
Hey.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.546
Hey, there'’s my guy.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.809
Hi, Mom.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.462
How was your weekend?Good.

10:37.549 --> 10:38.899
Grandma made brownies
in the kitchen.

10:40.335 --> 10:42.119
Bye.

10:42.206 --> 10:43.425
All right, see you next week.

10:43.512 --> 10:44.905
Hey, uh,

10:44.992 --> 10:46.646
before you go,
can I ask you something?

10:46.733 --> 10:48.604
Sure.
BONNIE:
Hey!

10:48.691 --> 10:51.128
When you'’re trying to recover
from a soul-shattering disease

10:51.215 --> 10:52.913
that destroys you
and everything you love,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.437
then you can
have a brownie!

10:58.701 --> 11:00.616
So what'’s up?

11:01.878 --> 11:03.358
I was just...

11:05.055 --> 11:07.492
Okay, this is a little weird,
but, um...

11:07.579 --> 11:09.103
when we were married,

11:09.190 --> 11:12.106
how would you describe our...

11:12.193 --> 11:14.325
sexual relationship?

11:14.412 --> 11:15.936
[chuckles]

11:16.023 --> 11:17.546
How would I describe it to you

11:17.633 --> 11:20.027
or how would I describe it
to my friends?

11:20.114 --> 11:23.334
Seriously, I-I need
a little perspective.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.641
Is this something to do
with being sober?

11:25.728 --> 11:28.513
Yeah, sort of.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.254
I mean,
the longer you don'’t drink,

11:30.341 --> 11:32.822
the more you see
who you really are

11:32.909 --> 11:35.172
and why you do stuff.

11:35.259 --> 11:38.480
Wow, that must suck.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.482
It'’s a bitch.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.529
Okay, well,
the way I remember it,

11:44.616 --> 11:46.662
we had three types of sex.

11:46.749 --> 11:50.013
Drunk, angry and...

11:50.100 --> 11:52.189
no, just two kinds of sex.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.713
Oh, come on.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.584
There must have been some times

11:55.671 --> 11:57.499
where we had
an emotional connection

11:57.586 --> 12:01.024
and, you know... made love.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.157
[laughs] Yeah, right.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.246
Why is that funny?

12:05.333 --> 12:08.336
I don'’t know, you were just
never really a girlie-girl.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.991
We always went at it
like two dudes.

12:14.081 --> 12:17.040
So what you'’re saying is...

12:17.127 --> 12:19.303
I'’m incapable of intimacy?

12:19.390 --> 12:21.044
Yeah.

12:21.131 --> 12:23.873
But it'’s a compliment.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.701
No, it'’s not!

12:25.788 --> 12:27.398
I'’ve got a problem.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.183
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

12:29.270 --> 12:31.751
my new girlfriend
is all about talking

12:31.838 --> 12:33.883
and sharing our feelings.

12:33.970 --> 12:36.233
I mean, by the time
we get down to it,

12:36.320 --> 12:40.237
I feel guilty doing dirty things
to such a nice lady.

12:40.324 --> 12:41.935
So you don'’t do it?

12:42.022 --> 12:43.893
Oh, I do it, I just feel bad.

12:46.156 --> 12:48.855
Thanks, but that doesn'’t really
help my situation.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.552
All right.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.684
I'’ll let you in
on a little secret.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.948
When I'’m with Candace

12:55.035 --> 12:58.081
and she'’s not gabbing,

12:58.168 --> 13:00.257
I pretend she'’s you

13:00.344 --> 13:03.304
to get me across
the finish line.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.875
Okay.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.311
Thanks for the help.

13:10.398 --> 13:13.575
Gonna close the door now.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.490
Stay freaky!

13:21.844 --> 13:23.150
I hope you'’re happy.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.108
You turned me into a dude.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.854
Oh, my God!

13:31.941 --> 13:33.421
How long are you gonna
pound that chicken?!

13:35.553 --> 13:37.164
Until I go blind.

13:38.730 --> 13:39.731
What'’s your problem?

13:39.819 --> 13:42.169
I don'’t have a problem.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.302
No, I keep track.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.609
That'’s not till next week.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.612
Menu meeting, your office, 4:00.

13:50.699 --> 13:53.571
4:00. You got it.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.926
Yeah, Gabriel, it'’s me.

14:00.013 --> 14:02.624
Listen, I'’m gonna need you
under my desk at 3:45.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.976
Yeah, that'’s right,
I said "under my desk."

14:14.244 --> 14:17.421
So I guess what
I'’m trying to say is,

14:17.508 --> 14:19.641
I'’m feeling real grateful
to be sober.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.469
My life'’s never been better

14:21.556 --> 14:23.950
and I finally have
hope for the future.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.214
[sobbing]

14:27.301 --> 14:30.695
I just wish I wouldn'’t have
waited so long and...

14:30.782 --> 14:33.655
[buzzer blares]

14:33.742 --> 14:36.005
Okay, that'’s all the time
we have for sharing.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.659
But before we close,

14:37.746 --> 14:38.921
I have a few
secretary'’s announcements.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.749
First off--

14:40.836 --> 14:42.403
and I can'’t believe I have
to bring this up again--

14:42.490 --> 14:44.274
do not park where
the orange cone is.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.363
That is reserved
for the secretary.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.104
Secondly,

14:48.191 --> 14:51.716
I want to introduce
a dress code for this meeting.

14:51.803 --> 14:54.589
I think we could attract
a better caliber of men in here

14:54.676 --> 14:57.461
if we bait the trap a little.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.637
Bonnie, this is
a women'’s meeting.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.813
Yeah, that'’s the next thing
I want to talk about.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.513
[knocking]

15:05.600 --> 15:07.123
You ready for us?

15:07.210 --> 15:09.125
Hell yeah!
Let'’s do this thing.

15:10.779 --> 15:13.303
Okay, Rudy, what do you got?

15:13.390 --> 15:16.045
Well, I am planning an adventure
for your tongue.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.568
Ooh.

15:17.655 --> 15:20.049
Like the sound of that.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.312
Now, starting with
the appetizer,

15:22.399 --> 15:24.488
I have created
a ramp and mushroom tart

15:24.575 --> 15:25.750
with celery pesto.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.970
Hmm. I don'’t know.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.232
What do you think,
Christy?

15:29.319 --> 15:32.279
Oh... I like that.

15:32.366 --> 15:33.541
It'’s light.

15:33.628 --> 15:34.803
Tasty.

15:36.892 --> 15:40.069
So glad
the former waitress approves.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.245
Now, next,

15:42.332 --> 15:43.943
I would like to swap out
the beet salad

15:44.030 --> 15:45.422
for one with sweet gem
lettuce...

15:45.509 --> 15:46.423
CHRISTY:
Ah...

15:46.510 --> 15:47.990
that works.

15:48.077 --> 15:50.601
Keep going.

15:50.688 --> 15:53.735
...and blanched asparagus
and an avocado vinaigrette.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.258
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

15:55.345 --> 15:57.913
That'’s perfect.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.697
Now, for the entrée,

15:59.784 --> 16:01.656
I'’ve been toying around
with a spring lamb

16:01.743 --> 16:03.353
served with a pickled artichoke.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.573
Damn it, that'’s good!

16:08.228 --> 16:11.187
Lamb and artichoke,
I mean, come on.

16:11.274 --> 16:13.537
And to finish
things off,

16:13.624 --> 16:16.323
a white peach crumble
with crème fraîche.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.238
Yes.

16:18.325 --> 16:21.110
That is how you finish.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.852
Yeah, I'’m not feeling it.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.549
You should be sitting over here.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.945
Bring me some more ideas
in the morning.
You know what?

16:30.032 --> 16:31.903
This may be your restaurant,

16:31.991 --> 16:33.514
but it'’s my culinary innovations
that people come for,

16:33.601 --> 16:34.950
so don'’t you dare tell me

16:35.037 --> 16:36.604
what I can or cannot put
on the menu.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.301
Get out.As long as we'’re clear.

16:41.522 --> 16:45.830
So, is there anything else
you need to discuss?

16:45.917 --> 16:48.572
Yes, I need to ask
a personal favor.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.096
Name it.

16:50.183 --> 16:51.706
I want you to go out
with Gabriel.

16:51.793 --> 16:52.968
[loud thump]

16:53.055 --> 16:55.492
Sorry, restless leg syndrome.

16:57.277 --> 17:00.149
You'’re trying to fix me up
with your ex?

17:00.236 --> 17:01.542
Well, the sooner
he meets someone,

17:01.629 --> 17:03.283
the sooner he'’ll re-marry,

17:03.370 --> 17:05.415
and the sooner I can stop
paying him alimony.

17:05.502 --> 17:08.723
So what you'’re telling me is
he'’s not good enough for you,

17:08.810 --> 17:10.029
but he'’s good enough for me?

17:10.116 --> 17:12.161
Thanks for not making me say it.

17:14.337 --> 17:15.512
Anyway, mull it over.

17:15.598 --> 17:18.079
Will do, boss.

17:19.255 --> 17:21.518
GABRIEL:
This is amazing.

17:21.605 --> 17:22.780
How do you figure?

17:22.867 --> 17:24.434
If she wants me
to date you,

17:24.521 --> 17:26.088
then we don'’t have
to hide anymore.

17:26.175 --> 17:29.178
We can have an honest,
open relationship.

17:29.265 --> 17:30.527
[sighs]:
Oh...

17:30.614 --> 17:32.399
You just don'’t get it, do you?

17:41.103 --> 17:43.018
My wife ruins everything.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.071
You know, it'’s Angela'’s job
to put this stuff away.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.942
Oh, yeah?Yeah, but apparently

17:54.029 --> 17:56.292
she had something better to do;
didn'’t even tell me.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.468
Oh, that'’s terrible.No, what'’s terrible
is running this meeting.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.470
All people do is complain.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.081
"We can'’t have a Facebook page,
we'’re anonymous."

18:03.125 --> 18:04.561
Uh-huh.

18:04.648 --> 18:05.780
I don'’t know
what you were thinking,

18:05.867 --> 18:07.347
roping me into this job.

18:07.434 --> 18:08.870
You know, let me ask you
something, Bonnie.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.393
Since you'’ve been secretary,

18:10.480 --> 18:12.178
how many times have you
thought about drinking?

18:12.265 --> 18:14.223
Who has time?
Plus, if I got drunk,

18:14.310 --> 18:15.920
who'’d make the brownies,
set up the chairs,

18:16.007 --> 18:17.008
get the Kleenex
for Wendy...

18:20.273 --> 18:22.623
Oh.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.842
You'’re welcome.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.061
I didn'’t say thank you.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.106
Yeah, you did.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.195
See you tomorrow.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.200
Stupid old bank robber.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.462
Can'’t believe
she talked me into...

18:35.549 --> 18:37.420
[buzzer blaring]

18:40.467 --> 18:42.947
Yeah, I can see
how that could be annoying.
