WEBVTT

00:09.210 --> 00:11.671
I just had
the most wonderful time today.

00:11.838 --> 00:14.924
Me too. It's funny, isn't it?
We worked together all that time,

00:15.091 --> 00:16.551
and we never dated before this.

00:16.801 --> 00:19.179
- Well, anyway. I was...
- Hey, Frasier.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.638
- Nancy, hi.
- Roz.

00:20.847 --> 00:22.390
- Hi.
- So are you back to work yet?

00:22.599 --> 00:24.309
Almost. I start at KNFS tomorrow.

00:24.476 --> 00:26.936
So, Roz, Nancy and I
are having coffee.

00:27.145 --> 00:30.231
Oh, none for me, thanks. Listen,
can I have a fat-free muffin, please?

00:31.024 --> 00:32.984
Nancy, I've been dying to call you.

00:33.193 --> 00:36.029
My cousin just moved to town,
and I think he'd be perfect for you.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.948
Actually, I just started
seeing someone.

00:39.157 --> 00:41.284
Well, you'll forget all about him
when you meet Chuck.

00:41.909 --> 00:46.205
He is so handsome and rugged,
and he loves the outdoors...

00:46.414 --> 00:48.458
Kindly leave him there.

00:49.042 --> 00:51.335
You see, the person
that Nancy is seeing is me.

00:51.502 --> 00:52.503
Really?

00:52.754 --> 00:55.298
- You two are dating?
- Even as we speak.

00:55.506 --> 00:58.843
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
Oh, well, good for you.

00:59.051 --> 01:01.179
I mean, who needs Chuck
when you've got the?

01:01.387 --> 01:02.763
Well, the anti-Chuck.

01:04.182 --> 01:06.642
When my muffin gets here,
could you send it over?

01:06.851 --> 01:08.477
You won't even see it coming.

01:10.730 --> 01:12.607
Well, where were we?

01:12.773 --> 01:14.817
I think you were about
to ask me out again.

01:15.026 --> 01:16.485
Oh, my gosh. So I was.

01:16.652 --> 01:19.530
Well, let's just see how far
this ESP of yours goes.

01:19.697 --> 01:21.115
What night was I thinking of?

01:21.991 --> 01:24.118
- Friday night.
- Astonishing!

01:24.368 --> 01:27.788
Busboy, clear these spoons
before she starts bending them.

01:28.414 --> 01:30.041
Frasier, I'm so glad you're here.

01:30.207 --> 01:32.835
- Niles.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Niles Crane.

01:33.043 --> 01:35.713
I think we've met. Nancy Cavanaugh.
I used to work at KACL.

01:35.921 --> 01:39.008
- Oh, of course. Talking business?
- Well, actually, no...

01:39.258 --> 01:41.802
Oh, good. I was afraid
I was interrupting something.

01:42.219 --> 01:44.597
Feast your eyes on this.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.016
Financial settlement?

01:47.182 --> 01:49.393
Good Lord, Niles, you and Maris
have come to terms?

01:49.643 --> 01:52.479
What was that? I couldn't hear
over the angels singing.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.983
Well, congratulations.
Oh, that is exciting.

01:56.191 --> 01:58.902
My brother's been going through
a rather rancorous divorce.

01:59.069 --> 02:02.322
- You must be very relieved.
- I'll say. It's cost me a fortune already.

02:02.531 --> 02:04.992
If she dragged it out any longer,
I'd be literally bankrupt.

02:05.242 --> 02:08.162
Well, I'm sure you've got
some celebrating to do, so off you go.

02:08.412 --> 02:10.205
I cannot wait
until I am done with this.

02:10.413 --> 02:11.957
I have to sign,
get her to do the same,

02:12.124 --> 02:14.168
and then I can take my seat
on the freedom train.

02:14.334 --> 02:16.879
Well, all aboard!

02:19.214 --> 02:22.968
It's a funny thing. One day, you're
starting a new relationship full of hope.

02:23.176 --> 02:28.682
The next you're sinking helplessly
into a sucking pit of despair.

02:29.182 --> 02:32.019
Leaves you filled
with the bitter bile of regret.

02:32.728 --> 02:34.604
You're on a date, aren't you?

02:36.732 --> 02:39.276
- It's hard to say at this point.
- I am so sorry.

02:39.443 --> 02:41.903
Oh, it's all right.
I have to go anyway.

02:42.112 --> 02:44.156
- It was nice seeing you again.
- Yes, you too.

02:44.364 --> 02:47.117
- Frasier, I am so sor...
- What the hell is wrong with you?

02:47.659 --> 02:48.910
Here we are.

02:49.161 --> 02:51.288
- We're on for Friday night?
- Yes, of course we are.

02:51.496 --> 02:54.332
You know, I was wondering,
maybe we could just...

02:54.499 --> 02:56.877
Have dinner at your place?

02:57.085 --> 02:58.253
Well, yes.

02:58.461 --> 03:00.338
That's amazing.
You read my mind again.

03:00.589 --> 03:03.550
I thought it would be more comfortable.
We could curl up on the couch,

03:03.717 --> 03:05.051
make a nice fire...

03:05.260 --> 03:07.387
Can you guess
what I'm thinking now?

03:08.346 --> 03:10.640
Oh, you are good, aren't you?

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.567 --> 03:22.152
- Hey, guys.
- Hey there.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.821
- Who won the squash game?
- It's not about winning or losing,

03:25.029 --> 03:27.699
- it's about the thrill of competition.
- Congratulations, Niles.

03:27.866 --> 03:29.409
Thanks, Dad.

03:30.702 --> 03:32.162
Pumped as I was,
I don't think anybody

03:32.370 --> 03:34.581
could've beat me today,
even an actual athlete.

03:35.832 --> 03:37.709
- Sherry, Niles?
- Yes, thank you.

03:37.917 --> 03:40.128
Maris and I have reached
a financial settlement.

03:40.336 --> 03:42.964
Oh, that's great!

03:44.382 --> 03:46.092
This is wonderful.

03:46.301 --> 03:48.928
Well, as wonderful as
the tragic ripping apart of two lovers

03:49.095 --> 03:51.306
once bound
in a sacred union can be.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.727
- No, it's brilliant, Dr. Crane.
- Thanks, Daphne.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.437
As long as you're doing the laundry,

03:57.603 --> 03:59.731
- let me throw in my gym towel.
- All right.

03:59.939 --> 04:02.942
If you've got a couple of minutes,
I can also give you these squash togs.

04:03.109 --> 04:05.403
Oh, let's save some of the fun
for tomorrow.

04:06.904 --> 04:09.448
What's this? Cartier?

04:09.615 --> 04:11.826
- Niles, did you put this in there?
- No.

04:12.034 --> 04:13.661
Somebody must have
slipped it in my bag

04:13.828 --> 04:15.371
when we were at the court.

04:15.580 --> 04:17.957
That's odd. I don't remember
anyone touching our things

04:18.165 --> 04:20.375
other than the valet
and Jaime, the squash porter.

04:20.625 --> 04:23.796
Boy, you boys really work up
quite a sweat down there, don't you?

04:24.880 --> 04:26.924
Oh, my goodness.
Niles, look at this.

04:27.967 --> 04:30.344
Cuff links! They're beautiful.

04:30.553 --> 04:33.556
There's a card in here. Let's see.

04:33.723 --> 04:35.766
"I still think of you constantly.

04:35.933 --> 04:37.977
I was wrong to ever let you go.

04:38.185 --> 04:39.645
Do you believe in second chances?"

04:39.854 --> 04:41.897
- It's unsigned.
- "Wrong to let you go."

04:42.148 --> 04:44.191
It sounds like it's from someone
who dumped you.

04:45.985 --> 04:49.071
Well, that's no short list now, is it?

04:51.615 --> 04:53.742
Maybe it's that Sonia woman
he was going out with.

04:53.909 --> 04:56.203
- Yeah, wasn't there a sister too?
- And a niece.

04:56.412 --> 04:58.455
He went through that family
like a recessive gene.

04:58.622 --> 04:59.999
Yes, well...

05:00.708 --> 05:03.711
Not to disrupt the think tank,
but there is an easy way to find out.

05:03.919 --> 05:06.380
I'll just make a few
well-placed enquiries

05:06.630 --> 05:08.674
and see where I get a nibble.

05:09.717 --> 05:10.801
Oh, yes.

05:11.635 --> 05:13.429
There's a group of people
that might regret

05:13.637 --> 05:18.016
having left Club Frasier
before last call.

05:19.226 --> 05:20.769
Oh, yeah, Patricia.

05:22.354 --> 05:25.774
And there's, oh, Susan, yes.

05:25.983 --> 05:29.236
Tatiana. Oh, boy...

05:29.736 --> 05:32.114
Frasier, all during squash
the whole thing you talked about

05:32.281 --> 05:33.782
was this wonderful woman
in your life.

05:33.949 --> 05:35.993
You're gonna drop her
to chase after someone else?

05:36.243 --> 05:38.370
I'm not dropping Nancy. I'm just...

05:38.620 --> 05:41.623
- Weighing your options?
- Well, all right. So, what if I am?

05:41.832 --> 05:43.208
I don't believe this.

05:43.458 --> 05:46.294
Niles, all of my life I have dreamt
of the day when I would be pursued

05:46.503 --> 05:48.046
by more than one woman.
What man hasn't?

05:48.255 --> 05:50.549
Do you blame me for enjoying it
now that the day is here?

05:50.757 --> 05:53.760
All my whole life I had to listen
to you whine about your dating woes.

05:53.969 --> 05:56.430
You have a chance for something
good. You're gonna risk it?

05:56.596 --> 05:58.640
- You're jealous, that's what.
- I am not jealous.

05:58.807 --> 06:00.308
- You're foolish.
- Come on. Nonsense.

06:00.475 --> 06:02.853
- Dad, don't you agree?
- Let's ask Dad. What do you think?

06:03.019 --> 06:05.397
Oh, no, don't drag me into this.

06:05.605 --> 06:08.775
I learned when you were kids to stay
out of it whenever you started fighting.

06:09.025 --> 06:11.736
I'd just wait till the whole thing ended,
usually in tears,

06:11.903 --> 06:14.030
and then I'd take you both out
for ice cream.

06:14.197 --> 06:17.200
That was my job, ice-cream man.

06:17.909 --> 06:20.203
Yeah, I suppose fathers
are the same everywhere.

06:20.412 --> 06:21.913
Mine couldn't bear to see us fight.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.083
If there was so much as a peep out
of us, he'd be out the door to the pub,

06:25.291 --> 06:28.169
stay for a few hours,
sometimes overnight.

06:28.336 --> 06:30.046
When they brought him back
the next morning,

06:30.255 --> 06:32.549
we couldn't fight
because of his headaches.

06:34.092 --> 06:37.929
I suppose that was part of his plan
to keep harmony in the family.

06:38.138 --> 06:39.222
God bless him.

06:41.558 --> 06:44.435
Oh, Daphne, wait up.
I'll ride down with you.

06:44.936 --> 06:47.689
Frasier, you have a chance
for something real with Nancy.

06:47.939 --> 06:50.066
Only a fool would throw that away
chasing after some...

06:50.275 --> 06:51.651
- It's here!
- Oh, oh, wait for me.

06:51.818 --> 06:53.778
- Pie in the sky.

06:54.988 --> 06:56.781
What an idiot.

07:01.619 --> 07:04.789
Tatiana? Frasier Crane calling.

07:04.956 --> 07:07.959
Yes, pick up if you're there.

07:08.709 --> 07:11.003
Well, I guess I've missed you.

07:11.212 --> 07:13.756
The question is:

07:13.923 --> 07:16.300
Have you missed me?

07:18.594 --> 07:21.222
- Oh, hi, Frasier.
- Hi, Roz.

07:21.389 --> 07:24.141
- Why so glum?
- Why else?

07:24.350 --> 07:26.644
The weekend's starting again,
and I don't have a date.

07:27.186 --> 07:29.397
Do you know how long
it's been since?

07:30.398 --> 07:33.067
You know. I probably forgot how.

07:33.275 --> 07:35.486
Oh, no, Roz.
I'm sure it'll come back to you.

07:35.653 --> 07:37.113
It's just like riding a bicyclist.

07:37.321 --> 07:39.448
Bicycle.

07:42.076 --> 07:44.036
You're in the same boat.
Why don't you come over,

07:44.245 --> 07:47.248
hang out with me and Alice?
I'll rent a movie. We can order pizza.

07:47.498 --> 07:49.375
I'd love to.
Just, I've got a date with Nancy.

07:49.917 --> 07:51.418
- That's still going on?
- Yes.

07:51.627 --> 07:53.754
In fact, we're going out tonight
on our third date.

07:53.921 --> 07:58.008
You know the kind.
It's like one of your first dates.

08:00.678 --> 08:02.388
- Well, I gotta go.
- All right.

08:02.554 --> 08:04.098
You're Dr. Crane, right?

08:04.306 --> 08:08.060
- Yes, I am. Can I help you?
- A woman dropped this off for you.

08:08.394 --> 08:10.270
Oh, my gosh.

08:10.479 --> 08:12.690
It must be another gift
from my secret admirer.

08:12.940 --> 08:15.943
- You've got a secret admirer?
- Yes, I do. In fact, the other day

08:16.110 --> 08:19.279
she sent me these cuff links.
At least, I think it's the same woman.

08:19.488 --> 08:22.574
Unless a third person
has thrown her hat into the ring.

08:22.783 --> 08:24.910
Oh, my God. You have two women?

08:25.119 --> 08:27.246
- At least.
- And you're juggling them,

08:27.412 --> 08:29.373
and you're getting jewellery?

08:29.581 --> 08:30.916
Why is that so hard to believe?

08:31.124 --> 08:34.211
Well, I guess since they cloned
that sheep, anything's possible.

08:36.712 --> 08:39.967
- Hey, Roz. Hey, Fras.
- Oh, hey, Frasier.

08:40.174 --> 08:41.717
- Dad, Niles.
- What is this?

08:41.927 --> 08:44.054
Oh, not another gift
from your mystery woman.

08:44.261 --> 08:46.390
Yes. Yes, indeed, it is.

08:47.432 --> 08:48.517
Oh, my God.

08:48.725 --> 08:51.019
It's a Patek Philippe pocket watch.

08:51.228 --> 08:53.021
That is stunning!

08:53.271 --> 08:55.565
I almost bought one like that
on my honeymoon.

08:55.816 --> 08:59.820
Only, Maris thought it was impractical
so we got that glockenspiel instead.

09:00.612 --> 09:02.155
So who do you think
this stuff is from?

09:02.364 --> 09:06.201
Gosh, I haven't smoked her out yet,
but she certainly has exquisite taste.

09:06.409 --> 09:09.496
Doesn't have a bad eye
for jewellery either.

09:10.747 --> 09:15.001
He was like this last night. It was
all I could do to keep my beer down.

09:15.502 --> 09:16.586
Well, lookie there.

09:17.712 --> 09:19.422
No, no, no, Dad.

09:19.923 --> 09:21.341
That's Tina Dalton.

09:21.508 --> 09:24.177
We dated last summer.

09:24.552 --> 09:30.975
And now, it turns out she's in the café
just as this little bauble arrives.

09:31.810 --> 09:35.480
Coincidence? I think not.

09:36.648 --> 09:38.024
Frasier, before you go over there...

09:38.233 --> 09:39.859
I've had enough
of your finger-wagging.

09:40.026 --> 09:42.070
I am doing what any red-blooded
American man would.

09:42.237 --> 09:44.280
There's nothing wrong
with playing the field.

09:44.489 --> 09:47.408
Looks like you've been eating the field.
What did you have for lunch?

09:47.575 --> 09:51.329
Pesto. Oh, my God.
All right, I better go freshen up.

09:53.248 --> 09:55.375
Look at this mess.

09:55.541 --> 09:57.919
You know, it's too bad
it's not bubblewrap.

09:58.127 --> 10:00.004
You don't know what funny is
until you see Eddie

10:00.213 --> 10:02.090
go at a sheet of that stuff.

10:04.509 --> 10:07.178
He gets all scared, runs away,

10:07.345 --> 10:10.848
and then... screws up his courage
and comes back again.

10:11.599 --> 10:13.893
And he runs away again.

10:15.561 --> 10:18.564
Yes, I watched him
for an hour one time.

10:18.815 --> 10:23.027
You know, it's amazing how entertained
you can be by something so simple.

10:35.581 --> 10:37.208
Oh, my...

10:37.875 --> 10:39.043
What is it?

10:39.251 --> 10:43.089
This card that came with the gift,
Frasier must not have noticed it.

10:43.255 --> 10:48.052
"Missing you every moment,
my dear, sweet Niles."

10:49.804 --> 10:51.931
- Do you realise what this means?
- Well, yeah.

10:52.181 --> 10:53.891
You're the one
with the secret admirer.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.726
And a pretty nice watch too!

10:59.021 --> 11:02.358
Well, I don't get this.
How could this happen?

11:02.608 --> 11:06.445
Well, the other gift was left
in Frasier's squash bag,

11:06.612 --> 11:07.780
which is exactly like mine.

11:07.947 --> 11:11.533
And I guess today the waitress
must've mistaken Frasier for me.

11:13.661 --> 11:16.455
- You don't suppose it's Daphne.
- Yeah, she took the second job

11:16.622 --> 11:20.292
washing that old Mrs. Lumpkin's hair
just so she could give you Cartier.

11:21.335 --> 11:23.796
Besides, the note says
it's someone you've been with.

11:26.048 --> 11:28.092
There have been
so few women since Maris.

11:28.258 --> 11:30.469
There were so few women
before Maris.

11:30.677 --> 11:33.222
- Hence, there was Maris.
- I bet it is Maris.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.265
You said you saw that watch
on your honeymoon.

11:35.474 --> 11:36.725
Oh, that's... That's absurd.

11:36.892 --> 11:38.936
Dad, we're in the process
of finalizing a divorce...

11:39.102 --> 11:42.105
Excuse me, miss? Do you remember
the woman who brought this box in?

11:42.272 --> 11:46.109
Yeah, she was a very well-dressed
and really, really thin.

11:46.985 --> 11:48.612
Well, that could be a lot of people.

11:48.779 --> 11:51.448
She just dropped off the gift
and then ordered a whole-milk mocha

11:51.615 --> 11:53.325
with whipped cream
and chocolate shavings.

11:53.575 --> 11:57.746
- Oh, thank God. That's not her.
- Yeah, it was really weird, though.

11:57.954 --> 12:02.334
She took a really long whiff of it,
and then just handed it back.

12:11.301 --> 12:14.471
Well, thank you, Marta,
you've been very helpful.

12:15.138 --> 12:17.265
Well, turns out
Schenkman dropped Maris,

12:17.516 --> 12:20.685
- and now she wants me back again.
- Well, that was fun.

12:20.852 --> 12:22.896
We had a little catching up to do,
but it turns out

12:23.063 --> 12:24.439
she wasn't the woman
sending gifts.

12:24.606 --> 12:27.275
Yeah, we know.
The gifts are from Maris.

12:28.234 --> 12:32.697
Maris is my secret admirer?

12:34.491 --> 12:36.785
- No, she sent them to me.
- But they're...?

12:37.786 --> 12:40.163
Schenkman dumped her
and she wants me back.

12:40.371 --> 12:43.374
- How do you feel about this?
- Well, frankly, I feel a little injured.

12:43.541 --> 12:46.461
I thought I had a secret admirer.

12:46.711 --> 12:49.380
Well, no matter, I do have a date
with Nancy tonight.

12:49.547 --> 12:51.925
You know, it's our third date.

12:52.175 --> 12:54.052
I was talking to Niles.

12:55.553 --> 12:59.474
I guess I'll just have to go over
and talk to Maris and set her straight.

12:59.724 --> 13:01.351
I don't know
if that's a very good idea.

13:01.559 --> 13:03.269
Well, I'm up to my ears in debt.

13:03.478 --> 13:06.397
I need her to sign this settlement.
She'll never do that if there's hope

13:06.564 --> 13:08.941
- of us getting together.
- It just seems dangerous to me,

13:09.150 --> 13:11.444
confronting her when
she's so vulnerable, don't you agree?

13:11.694 --> 13:13.821
Don't ask me.
I'm just the ice-cream man.

13:14.530 --> 13:15.782
Thanks a lot. Listen.

13:15.990 --> 13:17.617
Niles, I think
this whole pursuit of you

13:17.784 --> 13:19.660
has been brought on
by a panicked reaction

13:19.827 --> 13:20.828
to Schenkman dumping her.

13:21.037 --> 13:23.790
You know, give her a few days,
she'll probably realise that herself.

13:23.956 --> 13:26.959
- That's when you should approach.
- I can't wait. Do you have any idea

13:27.126 --> 13:29.795
how insulting it is that she thinks
she can buy me with trinkets?

13:29.962 --> 13:32.423
I am this close to being free,
financially and emotionally.

13:32.590 --> 13:36.260
- I'm going to settle this right now.
- Niles, I just think you should wait.

13:37.386 --> 13:39.513
Oh, God.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.184
Well, he certainly
dashed out of here in a hurry.

13:43.351 --> 13:46.354
- I suppose that's a good thing though.
- Yeah, he's not gonna back down.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.940
That, and he forgot these cuff links.
I've got a date tonight.

13:55.446 --> 13:58.616
Oh, Daphne, thanks again
for taking Dad over to Niles' for me.

13:58.824 --> 14:01.202
I mean, I would do it myself,
but since you are going out...

14:01.452 --> 14:04.205
I'm going to a party
three floors down from here.

14:06.123 --> 14:09.460
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry. I had no idea.
I didn't mean for you

14:09.668 --> 14:13.714
to miss any of the fun.
Dad, shake a leg. Daphne's in a hurry.

14:14.256 --> 14:16.383
You know, I'm really glad
he's going over there.

14:16.634 --> 14:18.844
No idea what condition
Niles will be in after Maris.

14:19.011 --> 14:21.764
Yeah, it's a shame
about Dr. And Mrs. Crane.

14:21.930 --> 14:24.725
It seems so difficult these days
to make something last.

14:25.142 --> 14:29.063
To find someone to grow old with
and share all of life's little details.

14:29.229 --> 14:31.607
I only hope someday
I'll find that kind of intimacy.

14:31.815 --> 14:32.900
I'm sure you will, Daphne.

14:33.108 --> 14:34.902
Daphne, where the hell is my scarf?

14:35.068 --> 14:37.362
- In your sleeve where it always is.
- Oh, all right.

14:37.571 --> 14:40.240
Come on, let's get going.
There's construction by the waterfront.

14:40.407 --> 14:42.451
We're not going that way,
we're taking my shortcut.

14:42.618 --> 14:44.995
I know your shortcuts,
and the waterfront's faster.

14:45.162 --> 14:46.496
Now, don't start with me.

14:46.663 --> 14:48.540
Don't you start with me,
or I'll leave you here.

14:48.749 --> 14:50.792
Oh, hi, how are you doing?
Come on in.

14:51.627 --> 14:53.754
And we're turning on
my radio station in the car.

14:53.921 --> 14:57.007
Fine. It's better
than listening to you talk.

14:58.091 --> 15:00.927
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no, no, that's a bad time.

15:01.094 --> 15:02.179
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:02.346 --> 15:04.056
Boy, you look sensational.

15:04.306 --> 15:06.767
- Thank you. So do you.
- Oh, thank you very much.

15:06.975 --> 15:09.102
- Can I interest you in a glass of wine?
- Perfect.

15:09.269 --> 15:11.062
- Lovely.
- I've been here before, you know.

15:11.271 --> 15:12.814
Two years ago
for your Christmas party.

15:12.981 --> 15:15.609
- Really?
- I don't remember this chair.

15:15.817 --> 15:19.070
Oh, well, normally there's something
draped over it, my father.

15:20.447 --> 15:22.073
Oh, there's a message
on your machine.

15:22.282 --> 15:23.992
Must've come in
while I was cooking dinner.

15:24.201 --> 15:26.244
I mention it because
I gave my secretary your number

15:26.453 --> 15:28.496
so she can call about
tomorrow morning's conference

15:28.663 --> 15:30.790
in case, you know,
I don't find my way home tonight.

15:30.957 --> 15:34.377
Oh, well, you just reverse
the directions I gave you earlier...

15:41.301 --> 15:43.344
Feel free to check the machine
if you like.

15:43.511 --> 15:46.473
I'll just go stir the risotto.

15:47.223 --> 15:49.517
<i>Frasier, this is Cheryl
returning your call</i>

15:49.726 --> 15:52.645
<i>and no, I didn't send you anything.</i>

15:52.854 --> 15:54.647
<i>I thought I told you
when we broke up:</i>

15:54.856 --> 15:56.900
<i>It's over.</i>

15:57.650 --> 16:01.154
Boy, is that old message still on there?
Cheryl and I broke up so long ago,

16:01.362 --> 16:05.408
<i>- I can't even remember when.
- Friday, 6:51 p.m.</i>

16:08.578 --> 16:10.622
I know it was a Friday.

16:10.788 --> 16:13.541
Oh, well, we all have exes.

16:13.708 --> 16:15.335
As long as it's over. It is over, right?

16:15.543 --> 16:17.420
Oh, God, yes. It certainly is over.

16:17.670 --> 16:20.339
Oh, Nancy, please.
Here, come sit with me.

16:20.506 --> 16:25.887
Listen, I want to tell you,
I'm not interested in anyone but you.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.268
Perhaps I better get that.
That could be your secretary.

16:32.518 --> 16:34.896
Oh, let the machine get it.

16:35.980 --> 16:38.608
<i>Frasier, it's Denise.
I don't know how you got my number,</i>

16:38.774 --> 16:41.068
<i>but I'm not interested
in dating you again.</i>

16:41.277 --> 16:44.780
Denise, you prankster!

16:46.282 --> 16:47.742
No. No, no. I won't.

16:47.908 --> 16:50.661
No, absolutely not.
I promise, never again.

16:53.748 --> 16:55.458
Well, how about
we have that dinner now?

16:55.624 --> 16:59.211
I don't believe this. You have
been calling other women for dates.

16:59.420 --> 17:00.880
- How could you lie?
- I didn't lie.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.215
Why would I lie to you?
I have nothing to hide.

17:03.424 --> 17:04.884
Oh, let me get that.

17:05.050 --> 17:06.135
Hello?

17:06.343 --> 17:07.344
Yes, l...

17:07.553 --> 17:10.181
Oh, yes, just a moment.

17:10.388 --> 17:11.473
It's your secretary.

17:12.016 --> 17:14.059
Hi, Gwen. Call me in the car
in five minutes.

17:14.268 --> 17:16.645
- I'm going home.
- No. No, Nancy.

17:16.854 --> 17:19.690
Nancy, please, please, please.
Oh, please don't be hasty.

17:19.857 --> 17:22.233
I realise I've done something
rather foolish.

17:22.443 --> 17:23.694
Just let me explain.

17:23.902 --> 17:27.156
Nancy, look, the truth is
I did call some women.

17:27.323 --> 17:29.700
I guess I was feeling insecure,

17:29.867 --> 17:31.660
a little nervous
about getting close to you.

17:31.869 --> 17:33.328
I don't blame you for being angry,

17:33.537 --> 17:35.831
and I wouldn't blame you
if you wanted to leave.

17:36.040 --> 17:39.543
It's just that I think
we really have something here.

17:39.793 --> 17:42.504
Well, I thought
we had something too.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.840
I made a mistake.

17:45.215 --> 17:46.592
Give me another chance.

17:47.885 --> 17:52.097
- Well, that risotto did smell good.
- Okay.

17:52.764 --> 17:55.767
- Frasier.
- Oh, Madeline.

17:55.934 --> 17:58.770
- I got that note you left under my door.
- I am so sorry about that.

17:58.979 --> 18:01.273
I was so happy to hear from you.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.442
Really?

18:03.859 --> 18:05.902
I was just thinking about you
the other day.

18:06.153 --> 18:09.406
You know, I don't even remember
why we stopped seeing each other.

18:09.614 --> 18:12.242
What is go...? This again?

18:12.451 --> 18:14.745
- Look, this date is over.
- Whoa, wait a minute.

18:14.953 --> 18:18.457
You slipped a note under my door,
and you're on a date with her?

18:18.707 --> 18:21.877
Well, you heard her.
Technically, this date is over.

18:23.545 --> 18:25.172
Don't ever call me again.

18:25.380 --> 18:28.008
Or me, you freak!

18:28.216 --> 18:31.303
Nancy, Madeline.
Please, give me a second chance.

18:31.553 --> 18:33.013
Either one of you.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.143
So then Daphne takes a left
on Madison.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.895
Bumper to bumper, all the way to Pike.
Then a right on Pike.

18:41.104 --> 18:43.815
And what do you know?
Kingdome traffic. So I say...

18:44.024 --> 18:45.817
- Dear God, this is taking forever.
- Exactly.

18:46.026 --> 18:47.902
And here we are on 5th...

18:48.111 --> 18:50.321
Wait, wait, don't go away.
I'm coming.

18:51.114 --> 18:52.198
Oh, Frasier.

18:52.449 --> 18:54.409
I've had one of the worst
experiences of my life.

18:54.576 --> 18:56.202
You took Madison?
You're as bad as Daphne.

18:56.411 --> 18:59.831
- What you should've done, for God...
- Oh, let it go!

19:01.916 --> 19:04.460
Please come in.
How was your date?

19:04.627 --> 19:08.131
Well, Nancy discovered
that I had been pursuing other women.

19:08.298 --> 19:11.634
- Well, how did she find that out?
- It wasn't hard.

19:11.801 --> 19:14.637
You see, I pursued one
during the date.

19:15.930 --> 19:18.308
- Well, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so am I, Fras.

19:18.516 --> 19:20.810
Well, thanks, guys. I just...

19:21.019 --> 19:23.312
I should've listened
to your advice, Niles.

19:23.479 --> 19:26.441
- How did things go with Maris?
- I wish I knew.

19:26.607 --> 19:29.527
I returned the gifts and told her
there was no chance of reconciliation.

19:29.694 --> 19:33.281
She didn't get mad.
In fact, she was eerily calm.

19:33.489 --> 19:36.576
She just stood there
with a blank stare on her face,

19:36.784 --> 19:38.911
rubbing her ocelot.

19:42.623 --> 19:45.293
You know, they got a cream for that.

19:53.342 --> 19:56.929
You know, maybe she'll come around.
You've given her a lot to digest.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.143
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

20:03.769 --> 20:07.356
- Oh, dear God.
- I don't believe it. I...

20:07.731 --> 20:10.192
I thought I made myself
perfectly clear.

20:10.359 --> 20:11.819
What is wrong with that woman?

20:12.069 --> 20:15.072
Why don't you start, Fras?
I'll jump in when you get hoarse.

20:24.415 --> 20:26.709
<i>Roses are red
Your heart is fickle</i>

20:26.917 --> 20:31.797
<i>When I'm through with you
All you'll have left is this nickel</i>

20:32.006 --> 20:33.507
Oh, no.

20:34.508 --> 20:36.802
- Oh, God, she's going to ruin me.
- No, no, Niles.

20:37.011 --> 20:38.595
You know,
maybe she's just bluffing.

20:38.762 --> 20:40.723
Once she's signed
the financial settlement, it's...

20:40.931 --> 20:42.891
She's not bluffing.

20:43.267 --> 20:45.811
This is the financial settlement.

20:47.271 --> 20:51.817
Oh, Frasier, why did I go over there?
Why didn't I listen to you?

20:52.025 --> 20:54.319
And why didn't I listen to you?

20:54.528 --> 20:56.488
If I had, I'd be sitting with Nancy
right now,

20:56.655 --> 21:00.158
sipping wine in front of the fire.

21:00.409 --> 21:02.953
I'll be stripped clean
and devoured like an animal.

21:03.203 --> 21:05.580
And I won't be.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.962
All right, now.

21:12.129 --> 21:15.632
Enough with these long faces.

21:16.925 --> 21:18.385
Who wants ice cream?
