00:09.000 --> 00:10.480
You OK?

00:13.080 --> 00:15.680
Elliot! Are you OK?

00:15.720 --> 00:16.000
Elliot! Elliot, are you OK?

00:16.000 --> 00:20.240
Elliot! Elliot, are you OK?

00:20.280 --> 00:23.480
Hey. I know, I know.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.000
Don't worry, I'm not looking.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.480
Don't worry, I'm not looking.

00:27.880 --> 00:31.600
How much further?
Uh... maybe 20 minutes.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.000
This place might as well be
on the moon!

00:32.000 --> 00:34.240
This place might as well be
on the moon!

00:34.280 --> 00:37.400
Alright, well, we'll stop for gas
soon,

00:37.440 --> 00:40.000
um, cos I'm also sure that Sprocket
needs to get out

00:40.000 --> 00:41.840
um, cos I'm also sure that Sprocket
needs to get out

00:41.880 --> 00:43.800
for a little bit of a break.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.080
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait, Mom, stop the car!

00:52.120 --> 00:54.600
Alright, what's wrong?
There's a woman.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.000
She's just standing there.

00:56.000 --> 00:56.080
She's just standing there.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.840
A... a woman? Is she OK?

01:07.200 --> 01:08.920
Don't go too far!

01:15.040 --> 01:16.720
You looking for someone?

01:16.760 --> 01:20.000
There was a woman. Looked scared,
black hair.

01:20.000 --> 01:20.440
There was a woman. Looked scared,
black hair.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.400
You oughta stay out the woods, son.

01:22.440 --> 01:26.400
There's stuff out here maybe
you don't wanna meet. Like... what?

01:26.440 --> 01:28.000
I am so sorry. My son thought
he saw something,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.080
I am so sorry. My son thought
he saw something,

01:30.120 --> 01:34.080
but I don't think so.
Where you headed? Wickensburg.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.000
Wickensburg? Yeah.
Ain't nobody goes there.

01:36.000 --> 01:36.640
Wickensburg? Yeah.
Ain't nobody goes there.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.280
Uh, well, we are.

01:38.320 --> 01:40.400
See not even this weirdo
likes this place.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.200
Stop. You're the new reporter.

01:42.240 --> 01:44.000
Journalist. Yeah,
for the Wickensburg Herald.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.920
Journalist. Yeah,
for the Wickensburg Herald.

01:45.960 --> 01:50.520
Ain't nobody reads that.
Because the Deadhead can't read.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.000
Just go in the car, please.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.200
Just go in the car, please.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.000
Sorry to bother you.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.200
Huh.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.000
What was that all about?
Why'd he think
no-one ever goes to Wickensburg?

02:08.000 --> 02:08.640
What was that all about?
Why'd he think
no-one ever goes to Wickensburg?

02:08.680 --> 02:10.960
I don't know,
but don't even worry about it.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.720
He's... a very colourful local.
Oh, really?

02:13.760 --> 02:16.000
I thought he was the next host
of 'Dancing with the Stars.'

02:16.000 --> 02:16.320
I thought he was the next host
of 'Dancing with the Stars.'

02:21.440 --> 02:23.880
And even the sign is weird.

02:23.920 --> 02:24.000
OK, that's enough.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.920
OK, that's enough.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.920
You know what? You really need
to learn critical thinking.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.920
I don't know what that is,

02:31.960 --> 02:32.000
but if we get into our new house

02:32.000 --> 02:33.760
but if we get into our new house

02:33.800 --> 02:35.880
and I hear...
"Get out now,"

02:35.920 --> 02:37.280
I am so outta there.

02:37.320 --> 02:38.840
You know what?

02:38.880 --> 02:40.000
Alright, it's not
'The Amityville Horror.'

02:40.000 --> 02:42.480
Alright, it's not
'The Amityville Horror.'

02:42.520 --> 02:45.080
Amityville Horror, yeah,
I'm gonna go with that.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.000
Don't bother. Your grandmother
on your father's side

02:48.000 --> 02:49.160
Don't bother. Your grandmother
on your father's side

02:49.200 --> 02:52.680
claimed to have dreams and visions
all the time.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.960
So if anything bad was gonna happen,

02:56.000 --> 02:57.600
you come from good stock.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.520
That's strange, the GPS
just lost its signal.

03:07.560 --> 03:08.760
I can't find our street.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.000
Can you check your phone, please
and see if you can
pull up the address?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.160
Can you check your phone, please
and see if you can
pull up the address?

03:14.200 --> 03:16.800
Yeah. No reception.

03:16.840 --> 03:20.000
You gotta be kidding me.
We're in the Bermuda Triangle
of phone reception.

03:20.000 --> 03:20.160
You gotta be kidding me.
We're in the Bermuda Triangle
of phone reception.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.440
I am gonna just pull over
and I will ask.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.640
OK, be right back.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.000
Excuse me. Can you, um... tell...

03:36.000 --> 03:37.480
Excuse me. Can you, um... tell...

03:40.880 --> 03:42.400
They're not friendly...

03:59.480 --> 04:00.000
Whoa!

04:00.000 --> 04:01.320
Whoa!

04:01.360 --> 04:04.480
Uh, hi, I'm Elliot Lucas.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.600
My name is Willow Darkwood.
Welcome to Wickensburg.

04:07.640 --> 04:08.000
You know, that's the nicest thing
anyone said to me

04:08.000 --> 04:09.960
You know, that's the nicest thing
anyone said to me

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
since we got here.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.680
Why were you standing up there?
Because it's noon.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.000
OK, is absolutely everything
in this town weird?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.440
OK, is absolutely everything
in this town weird?

04:18.480 --> 04:20.880
You can feel it too, can't you?

04:20.920 --> 04:23.080
Dark soul of Wickensburg.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.000
You know what? I... actually can.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.200
You know what? I... actually can.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.000
Hey.

04:40.000 --> 04:40.640
Hey.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.240
You OK? Yeah, uh, did you see...?

04:45.280 --> 04:48.000
See who? Oh, never mind.

04:48.000 --> 04:48.280
See who? Oh, never mind.

04:48.320 --> 04:52.360
You find out where we're headed?
No, I didn't.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.360
People are, uh...

04:55.400 --> 04:56.000
Weird? Yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.560
Weird? Yeah.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.000
Aha, Wahlbig Street.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.960
Aha, Wahlbig Street.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.080
25... 25.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.720
There it is.

05:27.920 --> 05:28.000
Oh, wow!

05:28.000 --> 05:29.560
Oh, wow!

05:29.600 --> 05:33.560
I mean, this is so much more
beautiful than the pictures.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.000
OK, it is pretty nice.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.520
OK, it is pretty nice.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.280
OK.

05:43.320 --> 05:44.000
Alright. I know.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Alright. I know.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.800
This place is big.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.320
Yeah, it's nice.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.080
Elliot?

06:16.240 --> 06:18.360
Boo! Oh, Uncle Dave!

06:18.400 --> 06:20.920
Only you would do something
like this.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.600
It's so good to see you. You too.

06:23.640 --> 06:24.000
Wow, Elliot.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.680
Wow, Elliot.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.280
Come on, last time I saw you,
you were like this high.

06:28.320 --> 06:31.080
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you
that much.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.000
I need fresh underwear.
I love this kid.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.800
I need fresh underwear.
I love this kid.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.200
He's a crack-up. Put 'er there.
No hard feelings, right?

06:36.240 --> 06:38.280
Uh, guess not. Well, you know what?

06:38.320 --> 06:40.000
Most people would just
knock on the door, maybe bring us
a casserole.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.040
Most people would just
knock on the door, maybe bring us
a casserole.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.960
How boring. I mean, come on,
you gotta admit

06:43.000 --> 06:46.200
that was pretty brilliant. That was
pretty brilliant. Mind you,

06:46.240 --> 06:48.000
holding that post for three hours
waiting for you wasn't much fun.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.040
holding that post for three hours
waiting for you wasn't much fun.

06:49.080 --> 06:52.640
Well, now you can help us unpack.
And there is a pizza in it for you.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.280
You say pizza?

06:54.320 --> 06:55.640
Mm-hm. Yeah, deal.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.000
Wow.

07:20.000 --> 07:20.200
Wow.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.760
Elliot, are these your photos?
They're incredible. Hey, mine.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.000
Sorry, it's... it's just something
I used to do with my dad.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.520
Sorry, it's... it's just something
I used to do with my dad.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.800
No, it's fine. It's OK, I get it.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.640
Hey. Thank you.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.560
Pizza! Finally. I'm starving.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.800
OK...

08:39.160 --> 08:40.000
Alright.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.320
Alright.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.360
OK.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.200
Mmm!

08:47.240 --> 08:48.000
It's so good.

08:48.000 --> 08:48.840
It's so good.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.600
Expected it to be like weird,

08:50.640 --> 08:51.960
like the rest of this place.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.400
So you, uh, noticed
Wickensburg has a few quirks.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.000
What is it with these people?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
What is it with these people?

08:57.040 --> 08:59.960
They talk like
it costs a dollar a word.
Remember the guy in the woods?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.480
"And nobody goes to Wickensburg."

09:03.520 --> 09:04.000
Oh, and people in town,
they were looking at me

09:04.000 --> 09:06.120
Oh, and people in town,
they were looking at me

09:06.160 --> 09:09.800
as if they were looking through me.
Like I wasn't even there.
Well, I don't know, I mean,

09:09.840 --> 09:11.640
it used to be a big farming town
when I was a kid.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.000
I guess all that stuff
kind of went away.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.360
I guess all that stuff
kind of went away.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.680
Why would it?
I mean, people need to eat.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.640
Who knows?

09:18.680 --> 09:20.000
But you might have come
at just the right time.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.520
But you might have come
at just the right time.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.480
There's a big new depot
on the edge of town.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.160
Maybe a few jobs for people.
Cheer the place up a bit.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.920
Sure needs cheering up.

09:27.960 --> 09:28.000
It's a small town, give it a chance.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.080
It's a small town, give it a chance.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.040
People will warm up.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.680
Yeah. I guess you've got
a new school to warm up to as well.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.000
Yeah, I mean, we've done that a lot

09:36.000 --> 09:37.280
Yeah, I mean, we've done that a lot

09:37.320 --> 09:39.040
when we moved around with Dad, so...

09:40.320 --> 09:42.880
Well, I haven't written
for a small-town paper

09:42.920 --> 09:44.000
since before you were born.

09:44.000 --> 09:44.720
since before you were born.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.360
So why are you doing it now?

09:46.400 --> 09:49.320
Because I need a job and one day
you'll understand that.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.400
This job here?

09:51.440 --> 09:52.000
Hey. Your mother's a great writer.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.600
Hey. Your mother's a great writer.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.120
Better than this place.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.000
Elliot, breakfast!

10:51.040 --> 10:52.920
Coming, I'm coming.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.000
Sleepy head! You usually get up
so early.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.920
Sleepy head! You usually get up
so early.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.000
I couldn't really sleep much
last night.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.920
Oh, don't tell me your Uncle Dave
got to you.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.000
No, it's just... first night
in a new place.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.040
No, it's just... first night
in a new place.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.280
No, no, no, no.
Don't give him bacon!

11:15.320 --> 11:17.000
Don't give him bacon.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.400
Why? Don't give him bacon!

11:19.440 --> 11:20.000
OK, I have to go
meet my new boss, Mr. Wilson,

11:20.000 --> 11:24.040
OK, I have to go
meet my new boss, Mr. Wilson,

11:24.080 --> 11:27.440
and I don't wanna be late.
But please can you please make sure

11:27.480 --> 11:28.000
you at least unpack your room
for me?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.160
you at least unpack your room
for me?

11:29.200 --> 11:32.960
OK, but I have to deal with this
first.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.200
And then unpacking, OK?

11:35.240 --> 11:36.000
Alright. Sprocket, you are
in charge. Make sure he does it.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.520
Alright. Sprocket, you are
in charge. Make sure he does it.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.040
Please unpack your room.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.640
I will, I will. That's all I ask.

11:43.680 --> 11:44.000
'Bye, I'll see you later.
Alright, 'bye.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.440
'Bye, I'll see you later.
Alright, 'bye.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.520
Celine. Would you please come in?

13:08.560 --> 13:09.600
Thank you.

13:09.640 --> 13:12.000
Peter Wilson. Nice to meet you.

13:12.000 --> 13:12.240
Peter Wilson. Nice to meet you.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.360
Nice to meet you. Please come in.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.640
Thank you.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.160
Have a seat.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.480
Thank you.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.840
So how are you settling in?
You and, uh...?

13:31.880 --> 13:34.840
Elliot. Uh, you know, good,
actually,

13:34.880 --> 13:36.000
we just got here yesterday.
But he's never been to a small town

13:36.000 --> 13:38.480
we just got here yesterday.
But he's never been to a small town

13:38.520 --> 13:42.160
before, so he thinks
everything is really weird.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.000
Why would he think that?
Well, he's a teenager.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.880
Why would he think that?
Well, he's a teenager.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.960
And if you meet him,
you'll understand why.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.240
That would be nice. Uh,
I'm going to, uh, put you

13:51.280 --> 13:52.000
on the news desk, but you know,
Elliot's right, it is a small town,

13:52.000 --> 13:55.800
on the news desk, but you know,
Elliot's right, it is a small town,

13:55.840 --> 13:59.120
not much international action
and intrigue in Wickensburg.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.000
Well, that's gonna be my job

14:00.000 --> 14:01.080
Well, that's gonna be my job

14:01.120 --> 14:03.080
to dig all that stuff up for you,
right?

14:03.120 --> 14:05.280
And actually I heard
that they're starting a new depot

14:05.320 --> 14:07.080
at the edge of town.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.000
Ah, Northeast Engineering
and Shipping.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.400
Ah, Northeast Engineering
and Shipping.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.160
Yes, that one's a little tricky.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.960
First new jobs around here
for years.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
So if we say the wrong thing
and someone objects...

14:16.000 --> 14:17.880
So if we say the wrong thing
and someone objects...

14:17.920 --> 14:20.080
Yeah, but it's good news, though,
right?

14:20.120 --> 14:23.080
Well, yes,
but let's just play it safe

14:23.120 --> 14:24.000
and leave Northeast alone.
Why don't you, uh...

14:24.000 --> 14:26.080
and leave Northeast alone.
Why don't you, uh...

14:28.520 --> 14:31.920
Oh, I, uh... I need to take that.

14:31.960 --> 14:32.000
Oh, OK, go ahead.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.400
Oh, OK, go ahead.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.440
Sorry, it's... it's very important.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.600
Oh. Sorry.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.000
Mrs. Johnstone will set you up
with payroll.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.600
Mrs. Johnstone will set you up
with payroll.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.000
Mrs. Johnstone... OK.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.520
Mrs. Johnstone... OK.

15:25.280 --> 15:28.000
'Because it's noon.' Oh, wow.

15:28.000 --> 15:28.760
'Because it's noon.' Oh, wow.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.720
Why do you have a photograph of me?
I don't.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.960
Yes, you do. I saw it
with my own eyes!

16:16.000 --> 16:17.280
No-one can see my photos.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.360
You took a picture of me.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.800
I didn't even know.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.640
Show me. Why should I?

16:22.680 --> 16:24.000
Because it seemed
a flattering depiction.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.520
Because it seemed
a flattering depiction.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.520
A what?

16:27.560 --> 16:29.360
Do you even speak English?

16:29.400 --> 16:31.960
It's a nice photo.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.600
My appearance
is generally abominable.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.640
Bad. I usually look bad in photos.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.280
It's... nice.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.000
Elliot, right? Your mom's
the new reporter at the paper.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.640
Elliot, right? Your mom's
the new reporter at the paper.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.000
Yeah.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.360
How do you know? Oh, brother...!

16:58.640 --> 17:01.280
Who's this? The village idiot.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.760
Hey, new kid.

17:03.840 --> 17:04.000
You don't want to hang out with her.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.640
You don't want to hang out with her.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.320
Why not?

17:07.360 --> 17:08.960
Cos this is her idea of fun.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Wearing black, being weird,

17:12.000 --> 17:12.440
Wearing black, being weird,

17:12.480 --> 17:16.360
hanging around here
while... nothing happens.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.320
Was fun till you showed up.

17:19.360 --> 17:20.000
She told you yet?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.640
She told you yet?

17:21.680 --> 17:25.000
Tell me what? What she is.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.360
Chad, don't.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.920
OK.

17:27.960 --> 17:28.000
Yeah, I won't tell him anything.
But I bet he'll ask.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.240
Yeah, I won't tell him anything.
But I bet he'll ask.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.200
Just so you know, new kid,

17:34.240 --> 17:36.000
we used to burn people like her
at the stake.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
we used to burn people like her
at the stake.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.000
Hey, wait up. You can have
the photo.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.120
Hey, wait up. You can have
the photo.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.000
Thanks.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.320
Thanks.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.920
So you want to know about the curse?

18:04.960 --> 18:06.720
You really come out here every day?

18:06.760 --> 18:07.760
Yes.

18:07.800 --> 18:08.000
Well, when school's out,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Well, when school's out,

18:10.040 --> 18:13.600
and I have piano classes on Sundays,

18:13.640 --> 18:15.800
and last week it rained a lot.

18:15.840 --> 18:16.000
So it's a part-time curse.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.360
So it's a part-time curse.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.760
Come with me.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.800
What is this place?

18:55.440 --> 18:56.000
It's a ship's bow. Can't you tell?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.560
It's a ship's bow. Can't you tell?

19:08.880 --> 19:10.800
I love it here. So peaceful.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.000
Uh, it's... kinda weird.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.520
Uh, it's... kinda weird.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.000
Is everything weird to you

19:16.040 --> 19:17.720
just because you've never saw it
before?

19:17.760 --> 19:19.360
Weird doesn't mean bad.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.000
Am I weird?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.880
Am I weird?

19:22.920 --> 19:24.320
Not in a bad way.

19:24.360 --> 19:27.200
I should be. I'm a witch.

19:29.240 --> 19:32.640
Uh, Willow, you're not a witch.

19:32.680 --> 19:36.000
You better hope I am or this town
will be cursed forever.

19:36.000 --> 19:36.040
You better hope I am or this town
will be cursed forever.

19:36.080 --> 19:39.320
Oh, right. Yeah, curse.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.000
Back in colonial times,

19:44.000 --> 19:44.720
Back in colonial times,

19:44.760 --> 19:48.160
the townsfolk drove out
a group of women they accused
of being witches.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.920
The witches cursed the town
so no-one could ever leave.
And those who came

19:51.960 --> 19:52.000
would be trapped here forever.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.160
would be trapped here forever.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.200
The people would be miserable,

19:57.240 --> 19:59.840
the crops would fail
and the livestock would die.

19:59.880 --> 20:00.000
And in 300 years an evil warlock
would come here

20:00.000 --> 20:04.080
And in 300 years an evil warlock
would come here

20:04.120 --> 20:06.480
and destroy the town
and everyone who lives here.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.760
A warlock?

20:07.800 --> 20:08.000
Like a witch, only a guy.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.240
Like a witch, only a guy.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.000
I'm sorry. That is gotta be
the craziest thing I've ever heard.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.840
I'm sorry. That is gotta be
the craziest thing I've ever heard.

20:17.880 --> 20:21.680
Just don't tell me
you believe all this.
Then what's going on, Mr. Lucas?!

20:21.720 --> 20:24.000
You can't deny it, you felt it too.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.880
You can't deny it, you felt it too.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.400
OK. OK.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.000
If you're a witch... read this.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.720
If you're a witch... read this.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.680
Where'd you get this?

20:42.520 --> 20:44.080
Where'd you even find this?

20:44.120 --> 20:46.440
It was in my sock drawer.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.000
It... it was just lying there.
We just moved in.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.880
It... it was just lying there.
We just moved in.

20:49.920 --> 20:54.520
Can you read it?
Well, this is in the town square,

20:54.560 --> 20:56.000
but I've seen this writing...
somewhere. Come on.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.160
but I've seen this writing...
somewhere. Come on.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.720
Are we in a hurry?

21:02.200 --> 21:04.000
The town is at stake!

21:04.000 --> 21:04.280
The town is at stake!

21:16.280 --> 21:18.920
Settling in OK? Yeah.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.000
I'm going over these story leads

21:20.000 --> 21:21.440
I'm going over these story leads

21:21.480 --> 21:23.040
and - This town is deadsville?

21:23.080 --> 21:25.360
Well, I was hoping it was
a slow news day.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.000
Honey, every day
is a slow news day around here.

21:28.000 --> 21:28.760
Honey, every day
is a slow news day around here.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.560
Hey, I heard there's a, um,
a new depot

21:31.600 --> 21:34.720
starting up at the edge of town,
some sort of engineering company?

21:34.760 --> 21:36.000
Is it worth looking into?

21:36.000 --> 21:36.200
Is it worth looking into?

21:36.240 --> 21:39.760
Uh, that's, that's Northeast
Engineering and Shipping.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.040
They kinda wanna keep that quiet.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.000
Plus their parent company
owns this paper.

21:44.000 --> 21:44.960
Plus their parent company
owns this paper.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.480
Owns the paper? So what?
I mean, that's good news.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.800
It's more jobs for the local people.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.000
Yeah, but I'd be careful.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.200
Yeah, but I'd be careful.

21:53.240 --> 21:56.240
Do you notice that Peter
was all twitchy-like?

21:56.280 --> 21:59.360
Yeah, actually I did, no offence.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.000
His job is on the line,
as is yours and mine too.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.400
His job is on the line,
as is yours and mine too.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.480
So I'd leave that place alone.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.000
OK, I will leave it alone.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.080
OK, I will leave it alone.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.720
Cup of coffee? Thanks.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.760
Creamer? Sure. Okey-dokey.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.840
Every time I come down here,
this fence gets bigger.

22:31.880 --> 22:32.000
What is this place?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.120
What is this place?

22:36.480 --> 22:40.000
It's a nexus of eldritch phenomena
that's been a focus
for uncanny happenings

22:40.000 --> 22:40.160
It's a nexus of eldritch phenomena
that's been a focus
for uncanny happenings

22:40.200 --> 22:41.240
since colonial times.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.440
It's a cave!

22:46.960 --> 22:48.000
It's been a special place
for hundreds of years.
Now they're ruining it.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.040
It's been a special place
for hundreds of years.
Now they're ruining it.

22:51.080 --> 22:54.000
Special to who? Witches!

22:55.320 --> 22:56.000
Come on, Willow.

22:56.000 --> 22:56.560
Come on, Willow.

22:56.600 --> 22:57.760
Just come with me.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.400
Look at this place.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.680
Over here.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.480
Oh. Oh, wow!

23:50.480 --> 23:52.000
There was never enough of this
to read before.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.040
There was never enough of this
to read before.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.200
So what does it say?

23:55.240 --> 23:56.680
This is amazing.

23:56.720 --> 23:57.920
Tell me what it says.

23:57.960 --> 24:00.000
Oh, it says four riders will come
at 12.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Oh, it says four riders will come
at 12.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.280
I always knew that.

24:05.760 --> 24:08.000
And then... I have...

24:08.000 --> 24:08.040
And then... I have...

24:11.080 --> 24:12.520
.. absolutely no clue.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.480
Uh, where's the other book?

24:15.520 --> 24:16.000
What other book?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.040
What other book?

24:17.080 --> 24:19.200
This is part two, where's part one?

24:19.240 --> 24:21.280
I don't know.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.240
What are those things?

24:30.640 --> 24:32.000
What are these things? Hey,
you kids, what are you doing here?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.720
What are these things? Hey,
you kids, what are you doing here?

24:33.760 --> 24:34.960
Willow, run!

24:51.640 --> 24:55.360
OK. Alright.

24:55.400 --> 24:56.000
OK.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.160
OK.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.840
25 Wahlbig.

24:58.880 --> 25:01.080
This is where Professor McAuliffe
used to live.

25:01.120 --> 25:04.000
McWho? Uh, he ran the museum.

25:04.000 --> 25:04.800
McWho? Uh, he ran the museum.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.160
He had all kinds of crazy things.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.240
He was really nice.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.880
I worked there over the summer.
That's very you.

25:11.920 --> 25:12.000
Yeah, OK. Where... where'd you find
the book?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.040
Yeah, OK. Where... where'd you find
the book?

25:14.080 --> 25:16.240
Up in my room. Alright.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.640
Uh, yeah, if...
if you wanna go up...

25:26.240 --> 25:27.960
Wow.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.880
I always wondered what boys had
in their rooms.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.920
What is this? Hey!

25:37.120 --> 25:41.000
Oh, who's this?!

25:41.040 --> 25:43.520
This is my dog, Sprocket. Hi!

25:43.560 --> 25:44.000
Ooh, is that your dad?

25:44.000 --> 25:45.360
Ooh, is that your dad?

25:45.400 --> 25:46.400
Yeah.

25:46.440 --> 25:48.400
He's a pilot in like the Army?

25:48.440 --> 25:51.320
That's amazing! Yeah, Air Force.

25:51.360 --> 25:52.000
He, uh... he died.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.120
He, uh... he died.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.000
Oh, like... what happened?

26:00.000 --> 26:00.440
Oh, like... what happened?

26:01.760 --> 26:03.760
The engine on his jet failed.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.680
He... he could have ejected,

26:05.720 --> 26:08.000
but he stayed with it
to make sure it didn't crash,

26:08.000 --> 26:08.640
but he stayed with it
to make sure it didn't crash,

26:08.680 --> 26:10.560
you know... people.

26:12.360 --> 26:13.960
Then it was too late.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.280
Went into the ocean.

26:15.320 --> 26:16.000
Then he was even more amazing.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.960
Then he was even more amazing.

26:19.720 --> 26:20.880
Yeah.

26:20.920 --> 26:23.600
Well, it is what it is. Come on.

26:25.920 --> 26:26.920
Hi.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.800
This is the attic.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.160
I like attics.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.400
Figures.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.440
Ooh, potions.

26:39.480 --> 26:40.000
Huh. Uh, kinda.

26:40.000 --> 26:40.800
Huh. Uh, kinda.

26:40.840 --> 26:44.920
But there's a lot of junk.
Don't look, it's not finished yet.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.080
OK, sorry.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.000
Sorry.

26:48.000 --> 26:48.120
Sorry.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.520
Ooh.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.920
These are cool. Watch this.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.320
It's weird you know how to do this.
It's not weird. You can do it too.

27:06.840 --> 27:08.000
Hm, give me.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.760
Clearly you're not doing something
right.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.440
I give up. I can't do it.

27:23.800 --> 27:28.000
If I were a 300-year-old
mystical book, where would I be?

27:28.000 --> 27:28.560
If I were a 300-year-old
mystical book, where would I be?

27:34.680 --> 27:35.680
OK...

27:38.920 --> 27:40.280
Please let this be a mummy.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.400
You call me macabre...

27:43.640 --> 27:44.000
Wait, wait, wait, hang on.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.840
Wait, wait, wait, hang on.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.400
What?

27:52.960 --> 27:55.400
Uh, may be nothing.
Where did you get that?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.880
Oh, Professor McAuliffe
left it to me in his will.

28:15.920 --> 28:16.000
It's volume one! It's what we need!
It's my mom.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.040
It's volume one! It's what we need!
It's my mom.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.400
Listen to me.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.000
Can I have the book?
I think it's yours anyways.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Can I have the book?
I think it's yours anyways.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.440
Hey, kiddo. Oh, hey, Mom.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.000
Oh, well, who's this?

28:40.000 --> 28:40.520
Oh, well, who's this?

28:40.560 --> 28:42.960
Oh, Mom, Willow.
Willow, meet my mom.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.040
Willow, it's so nice to meet you.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.840
Good evening, Mrs. Lucas.
You can call me Celine.

28:47.880 --> 28:48.000
We call Elliott's grandma
Mrs. Lucas.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.840
We call Elliott's grandma
Mrs. Lucas.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.920
Uh, you're a reporter.

28:51.960 --> 28:55.760
Journalist. Yeah, is that something
maybe you would wanna do?

28:55.800 --> 28:56.000
Oh no, I'm a -
She's gonna be in my class, yeah.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Oh no, I'm a -
She's gonna be in my class, yeah.

28:58.040 --> 29:01.640
Oh, oh, oh, that's...
that's so nice. That's great.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.480
Willow, would you like to stay
for dinner?

29:03.520 --> 29:04.000
Oh, I need to be home. Sorry.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.200
Oh, I need to be home. Sorry.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.080
Oh, OK, that's fine. Um, Elliot,
could you please

29:09.120 --> 29:12.000
show Willow out the door? Yeah,
for sure. It's so nice to meet you.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.400
show Willow out the door? Yeah,
for sure. It's so nice to meet you.

29:14.400 --> 29:18.280
Uh, how do I contact you?
Are you asking for my number?

29:18.320 --> 29:20.000
Well, it's just, you know -
It... just never happened before.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.280
Well, it's just, you know -
It... just never happened before.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.360
Seriously? I mean, uh -

29:23.400 --> 29:24.800
Give me your cell. Yeah.

29:27.960 --> 29:28.000
There. Thanks.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.920
There. Thanks.

29:32.960 --> 29:33.960
'Bye.

30:28.440 --> 30:29.840
Hello?

30:29.880 --> 30:31.080
It's me.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.000
Willow, it's...
it's almost midnight.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.360
Willow, it's...
it's almost midnight.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.200
Then we don't have much time.

30:35.240 --> 30:38.120
Middle of the night might be
your favourite time of day -

30:38.160 --> 30:40.000
Elliot, listen to me,
and you need to know this,

30:40.000 --> 30:40.880
Elliot, listen to me,
and you need to know this,

30:40.920 --> 30:43.000
because that curse 300 years ago?

30:43.040 --> 30:46.360
Uh-huh? It's 300 years tonight.

30:52.840 --> 30:55.760
This is crazy. We'll be grounded
for like a month if we do this.

30:55.800 --> 30:56.000
And if we don't,
the town will be destroyed

30:56.000 --> 30:58.840
And if we don't,
the town will be destroyed

30:58.880 --> 30:59.960
by an evil warlock.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.480
Like I said, crazy.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.720
Alright, what next?

31:31.760 --> 31:33.000
Well...

31:35.080 --> 31:36.000
Alright.

31:36.000 --> 31:36.320
Alright.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.600
You see this?
Sure, what does it say?

31:40.640 --> 31:43.400
It says four riders will come at 12.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.000
And I always thought it said
at 12 noon, because you know,
horses, cowboys,

31:44.000 --> 31:47.160
And I always thought it said
at 12 noon, because you know,
horses, cowboys,

31:47.200 --> 31:50.840
high noon. But it doesn't.
It says four riders

31:50.880 --> 31:52.000
will come at 12 midnight.

31:52.000 --> 31:52.800
will come at 12 midnight.

31:56.680 --> 32:00.000
You know what this is, Elliot?
These are the four curses.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.160
You know what this is, Elliot?
These are the four curses.

32:01.200 --> 32:04.200
It's the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

32:04.240 --> 32:08.000
Hey, I dreamed about this.

32:08.000 --> 32:08.200
Hey, I dreamed about this.

32:08.240 --> 32:11.440
You dreamed about what?
This, the monument,

32:11.480 --> 32:14.040
a guy on a white horse
with a bow and arrow.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.000
That's the first horseman.
That's Conquest. Look.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.360
That's the first horseman.
That's Conquest. Look.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.040
So... so what has this place
gotta do with conquest?

32:20.080 --> 32:23.920
It's a monument to Francois Le Bois,

32:23.960 --> 32:24.000
conqueror of the wilderness,

32:24.000 --> 32:25.440
conqueror of the wilderness,

32:25.480 --> 32:28.560
who in 1645 opened up the state
to settlement.

32:28.600 --> 32:32.000
He was killed on the spot
by a grizzly bear.

32:32.000 --> 32:32.880
He was killed on the spot
by a grizzly bear.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.520
I told you. I told you.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.920
An actual conjuring
right in front of us!

32:46.960 --> 32:48.000
It's... it's not magic.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.600
It's... it's not magic.

32:49.640 --> 32:52.440
It's just a piece of glass
or something

32:52.480 --> 32:54.000
lined up to catch the moon
on this date.

32:55.720 --> 32:56.000
Elliot, stop. What are you doing?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.360
Elliot, stop. What are you doing?

33:29.240 --> 33:30.880
It's an amulet of warning.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.520
Willow, don't creep up on people.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.000
I'm a witch.

33:36.000 --> 33:36.160
I'm a witch.

33:38.640 --> 33:43.680
But... look, three of the gems
are missing.

33:43.720 --> 33:44.000
That's why the town's so sick.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.440
That's why the town's so sick.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.800
The amulet should be protecting us.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.680
Four in total, three missing.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.200
Hey, can you hear that?

33:55.240 --> 33:57.320
It sounds like a steam train.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.000
Is this place
normally open at 1 am?

34:24.000 --> 34:24.160
Is this place
normally open at 1 am?

34:24.200 --> 34:26.480
It's been closed down
for years.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.360
Good evening, sir.
Welcome to Wickensburg.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.000
It's not the evening, Mr. Jenks.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.680
It's not the evening, Mr. Jenks.

35:05.720 --> 35:07.480
It's the middle of the night.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.600
And I think
we may have missed the event.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.000
I am so sorry, sir.
It's these old steam engines.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.120
I am so sorry, sir.
It's these old steam engines.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.720
Is it? Well...

35:20.280 --> 35:22.440
.. let's take a look, shall we?

35:44.520 --> 35:46.200
Believe me now?

35:51.640 --> 35:52.000
Mr. Wilson?

35:52.000 --> 35:53.120
Mr. Wilson?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.440
Ah, thanks for coming in, Celine.

35:57.480 --> 36:00.000
Can you do me up a piece
on the annual Founder's Day parade?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.880
Can you do me up a piece
on the annual Founder's Day parade?

36:01.920 --> 36:04.840
Oh, Mr. Wilson, with all due
respect, I know that I'm new,

36:04.880 --> 36:08.000
but I was really hoping
that I would be able to report on,

36:08.000 --> 36:08.720
but I was really hoping
that I would be able to report on,

36:08.760 --> 36:12.080
you know, hard news.
If you can find any.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.040
In case you haven't noticed,

36:14.080 --> 36:16.000
we don't have a lot of hard news
around here.

36:16.000 --> 36:16.160
we don't have a lot of hard news
around here.

36:16.200 --> 36:19.720
Well, I was looking into the new
industrial compound outside of town.

36:19.760 --> 36:23.320
Oh, no, no, Celine. Really,
we can't touch that.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.000
No matter what we said,
we'd upset someone.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.360
No matter what we said,
we'd upset someone.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.920
But the parade is a big deal
in this town.

36:28.960 --> 36:32.000
And what's the number one thing
that makes a news story
a news story?

36:32.000 --> 36:32.600
And what's the number one thing
that makes a news story
a news story?

36:32.640 --> 36:36.000
The number of people impacted.
Yes.

36:36.040 --> 36:40.000
So I'd like the piece to include
some historical background.

36:40.000 --> 36:40.520
So I'd like the piece to include
some historical background.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.600
You'll find the archives
in the basement.

36:42.640 --> 36:45.200
I'm guessing the archives
haven't been digitised.

36:45.240 --> 36:47.720
Digitised?

36:47.760 --> 36:48.000
You big city reporters crack me up.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.280
You big city reporters crack me up.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.760
Journalists...

38:22.560 --> 38:23.840
Oh, boy...

38:26.760 --> 38:28.560
Hmm.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.000
Hmm. Um-um-um.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.120
Hmm. Um-um-um.

38:33.160 --> 38:36.400
I wonder what Woodward and Bernstein
would do in this situation.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.080
What did you do to my truck?

39:00.120 --> 39:01.680
Nothing. Oh yeah?

39:01.720 --> 39:04.000
Well, then...
what are you doing here?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.040
Well, then...
what are you doing here?

39:05.080 --> 39:07.080
What are YOU doing here?

39:07.120 --> 39:09.600
Are you asking the questions now?

39:09.640 --> 39:11.760
What are you gonna do, huh?

39:11.800 --> 39:12.000
Run me off the road
with your new truck?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.440
Run me off the road
with your new truck?

39:13.480 --> 39:15.680
I just nearly had that happen.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.520
Maybe everyone in town
could take turns now.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.000
What did you do, kid?

39:20.000 --> 39:21.080
What did you do, kid?

39:22.080 --> 39:23.560
Put a hex on someone?

39:23.600 --> 39:26.480
You're a kid too. Difference is,
one day I'll grow up.

39:27.600 --> 39:28.000
Grow up?

39:28.000 --> 39:28.960
Grow up?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.760
Yeah, in that outfit
you look about ready to get buried.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.000
Elliot, are you home? Open up!

39:36.000 --> 39:36.320
Elliot, are you home? Open up!

39:38.720 --> 39:40.840
Elliot, that guy's car
was chasing me.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.280
Look at this. Did you see this?

39:42.320 --> 39:44.000
It was... it was the car
we saw last night.

39:44.000 --> 39:44.400
It was... it was the car
we saw last night.

39:44.440 --> 39:48.040
What is this thing behind you?
It was right outside here!
What is this? I didn't know

39:48.080 --> 39:50.680
you could do spirit photography.
Yeah, neither did I.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.000
Where's Sprocket?

39:52.000 --> 39:52.080
Where's Sprocket?

39:52.120 --> 39:54.520
I don't know, but he's fine. OK.

40:04.560 --> 40:08.000
It's the curse, it has to be.
Willow, I don't know what
to believe right now.

40:08.000 --> 40:08.400
It's the curse, it has to be.
Willow, I don't know what
to believe right now.

40:08.440 --> 40:12.240
We have all these books
and medallions - OK.

40:18.120 --> 40:20.320
These books are all about
the history of the town

40:20.360 --> 40:22.760
and the curse
which is placed on it.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.000
It says, "On the 300th anniversary
of the day
the witches were driven out,

40:24.000 --> 40:28.040
It says, "On the 300th anniversary
of the day
the witches were driven out,

40:28.080 --> 40:31.120
a powerful warlock will come here
and take revenge on the town."

40:37.680 --> 40:40.000
Sure, curse, revenge, fine.

40:40.000 --> 40:40.520
Sure, curse, revenge, fine.

40:40.560 --> 40:44.720
You see this? These are
the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.760
This is from the Book of Revelation.

40:48.840 --> 40:51.640
So if we follow the clues
to each of them,

40:51.680 --> 40:53.640
maybe we can find a way
to break the curse.

40:55.440 --> 40:56.000
So if we got this from the monument

40:56.000 --> 40:57.880
So if we got this from the monument

40:57.920 --> 41:00.800
and we need... three more...

41:00.840 --> 41:02.960
The next one would be war.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
So where is it?

41:04.000 --> 41:05.240
So where is it?

41:05.280 --> 41:08.680
And I don't even know how long
we have now that the warlock
is actually here.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.240
You were saying?

41:15.280 --> 41:17.680
Jeez, Sprocket.

41:20.200 --> 41:23.720
But, come on, he is not a warlock.

41:23.760 --> 41:26.800
Elliot, you saw what he did
to that guy.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.360
It just flew right into the window.

41:39.400 --> 41:40.960
That poor thing.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
What do we do with it?
We give it a proper burial.

41:44.000 --> 41:44.520
What do we do with it?
We give it a proper burial.

42:47.240 --> 42:48.000
Elliot, it's not even seven.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.480
Elliot, it's not even seven.

42:49.520 --> 42:52.120
Yeah, well, you're a full-time witch
today.

42:54.400 --> 42:56.000
Is there a statue of a soldier
holding an eagle somewhere?

42:56.000 --> 42:56.920
Is there a statue of a soldier
holding an eagle somewhere?

42:56.960 --> 42:58.960
Yeah, uh, up on Riverside. Why?

42:59.000 --> 43:02.800
I saw the red horse
and the guy holding a sword.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.000
The statue of a guy
holding an eagle.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
The statue of a guy
holding an eagle.

43:09.400 --> 43:11.600
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

43:11.640 --> 43:12.000
What? Ow, ow. No, not you,
it's just... I'll be there

43:12.000 --> 43:13.920
What? Ow, ow. No, not you,
it's just... I'll be there

43:13.960 --> 43:15.440
in like minus-10 minutes. Ow.

43:15.480 --> 43:18.000
Come on, slowpoke, let's go!

43:34.840 --> 43:36.000
That's it, that's what I saw.

43:36.000 --> 43:36.440
That's it, that's what I saw.

43:38.960 --> 43:40.960
War, it's war for sure.

43:52.240 --> 43:56.320
Whoa. OK, but now what? We just
have to do what we did last time.

43:56.360 --> 43:59.000
Find the clue. OK. Uh, let's see.

43:59.040 --> 44:00.000
There's one, two, three, four,
five pouches, two stripes.

44:00.000 --> 44:04.480
There's one, two, three, four,
five pouches, two stripes.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.960
So he was a corporal.

44:07.280 --> 44:08.000
Hm... I don't know.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.960
Hm... I don't know.

44:18.600 --> 44:20.560
Hey, there's something here.

44:20.600 --> 44:21.840
Where, what?

44:32.160 --> 44:34.040
Check that out.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.000
That's so cool!

44:39.040 --> 44:40.000
Here, let me try something.
You have the medallion? Yeah.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.360
Here, let me try something.
You have the medallion? Yeah.

44:51.960 --> 44:53.920
Two down. Two to go.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.840
'Morning, Celine. Good morning.

45:03.880 --> 45:04.000
I have the daily police report.
Oh, great.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.240
I have the daily police report.
Oh, great.

45:07.280 --> 45:12.000
Is there anything good in there?
Well, uh, plans for Founder's Day,

45:12.000 --> 45:12.040
Is there anything good in there?
Well, uh, plans for Founder's Day,

45:12.080 --> 45:14.000
a couple of DUIs.

45:14.040 --> 45:16.080
Oh, and a couple of kids broke in

45:16.120 --> 45:18.160
up at
the Northeast Engineering compound.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.000
But like I said,
maybe leave that one alone.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.440
But like I said,
maybe leave that one alone.

45:21.480 --> 45:22.600
Great.

45:24.440 --> 45:28.000
Well, I have 142 small ads
that I gotta go type up.

45:28.000 --> 45:28.600
Well, I have 142 small ads
that I gotta go type up.

45:28.640 --> 45:32.040
OK. So... see ya.

45:32.080 --> 45:33.280
See ya.

45:43.720 --> 45:44.000
Knock, knock.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.560
Knock, knock.

45:45.600 --> 45:49.000
Come in.

45:50.880 --> 45:52.000
What's up? Uh, well, I was going
through the archives, you know,

45:52.000 --> 45:55.360
What's up? Uh, well, I was going
through the archives, you know,

45:55.400 --> 45:58.880
for the Founder's Day piece,
and I found this.

46:05.600 --> 46:08.000
Does the Shippingport
atomic power station

46:08.000 --> 46:08.560
Does the Shippingport
atomic power station

46:08.600 --> 46:11.960
mean anything to you?
Because there was something in there
about waste management

46:12.000 --> 46:15.200
and Wickensburg. That was an idea.

46:15.240 --> 46:16.000
An idea from 50 years ago to maybe,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.600
An idea from 50 years ago to maybe,

46:18.640 --> 46:21.400
maybe build a waste facility.

46:21.440 --> 46:23.640
They never did. I wish they had,

46:23.680 --> 46:24.000
then this place
might have some jobs

46:24.000 --> 46:26.080
then this place
might have some jobs

46:26.120 --> 46:28.840
and some life and some hard news
for you to report.

46:28.880 --> 46:31.720
Uh, I'll file this for you.

46:34.120 --> 46:36.080
Um, well, OK.

46:36.120 --> 46:39.320
Now... the Founder's Day piece?

46:39.360 --> 46:40.000
I will make sure you get it.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.360
I will make sure you get it.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.080
OK.

47:01.080 --> 47:02.920
We're gonna
have to take care of this.

47:22.480 --> 47:23.720
You little...

47:36.720 --> 47:37.760
OK.

47:49.880 --> 47:51.680
Right, what next?

47:51.720 --> 47:52.000
OK, so we have four horsemen.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.720
OK, so we have four horsemen.

47:54.760 --> 47:56.800
We found Conquest, the white gem

47:56.840 --> 47:58.240
and we've got War, the red gem,

47:58.280 --> 47:59.720
so the next horseman is...

48:04.080 --> 48:05.320
OK.

48:05.360 --> 48:08.000
Famine. Famine, like crops failing?

48:08.000 --> 48:08.600
Famine. Famine, like crops failing?

48:08.640 --> 48:10.240
He rides a black horse and...

48:10.280 --> 48:12.280
So where's the statue of famine?

48:14.760 --> 48:16.000
I have no idea.
Think, you live here.

48:16.000 --> 48:16.720
I have no idea.
Think, you live here.

48:16.760 --> 48:19.000
So do you! Since Saturday!

48:21.400 --> 48:24.000
Elliott? Mom, what's wrong?

48:24.000 --> 48:24.120
Elliott? Mom, what's wrong?

48:28.880 --> 48:32.000
Have you been up at the Northeast
Engineering compound?

48:32.000 --> 48:32.520
Have you been up at the Northeast
Engineering compound?

48:32.560 --> 48:35.280
N-n-n-o-o-o-o-o-o-o.

48:35.320 --> 48:37.040
No. No.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.000
Elliot, have you been
up at the compound?

48:40.000 --> 48:42.400
Elliot, have you been
up at the compound?

48:43.920 --> 48:46.840
Oh... that compound.

48:46.880 --> 48:48.000
Yeah, that compound.
Maybe I should just... go.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.440
Yeah, that compound.
Maybe I should just... go.

48:50.480 --> 48:52.600
Oh, no, no, young lady.

48:52.640 --> 48:55.080
You are gonna stand right here
and you are gonna listen.

48:55.120 --> 48:56.000
Did you two actually
break into an industrial site?!

48:56.000 --> 48:59.520
Did you two actually
break into an industrial site?!

48:59.560 --> 49:01.400
What on Earth possessed you?!

49:01.440 --> 49:03.160
It's not a possession!

49:03.200 --> 49:04.000
It's a curse! Maybe even a haunting.
Look.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.120
It's a curse! Maybe even a haunting.
Look.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
What is that supposed to mean?
Willow, don't.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.120
What is that supposed to mean?
Willow, don't.

49:13.160 --> 49:16.480
This town has been under a spell
for 300 years and an evil warlock
arrived last night

49:16.520 --> 49:19.760
and is going to make the curses
come true. That old mine
has something to do with it.

49:19.800 --> 49:20.000
And it's really, really important.
And how do you know all this?

49:20.000 --> 49:22.720
And it's really, really important.
And how do you know all this?

49:22.760 --> 49:24.080
Because I'm a witch!

49:24.120 --> 49:27.920
Willow... it's time for you to go
right now.

49:29.400 --> 49:32.200
And you, young man,

49:32.240 --> 49:35.560
you're grounded. Phone.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.320
Hi, come on in. Hi.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.000
Am I early? No, not at all.
Sorry about the mess.

49:52.000 --> 49:52.920
Am I early? No, not at all.
Sorry about the mess.

49:52.960 --> 49:55.760
No, it's OK. It's just... lots.

49:57.360 --> 50:00.000
Hey, uh, is... is this one
of his photos?

50:00.000 --> 50:00.720
Hey, uh, is... is this one
of his photos?

50:00.760 --> 50:05.280
Oh yes. And his little girlfriend
insists that this town

50:05.320 --> 50:07.480
is under some witch's curse.

50:07.520 --> 50:08.000
He thinks that this is a ghost or,
or she does, I don't know.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.920
He thinks that this is a ghost or,
or she does, I don't know.

50:10.960 --> 50:14.120
So, you know, witches, ghosts,
curses.

50:14.160 --> 50:16.000
Um, yeah, so that's not a ghost.

50:16.000 --> 50:16.160
Um, yeah, so that's not a ghost.

50:16.200 --> 50:17.480
It's radiation damage.

50:17.520 --> 50:19.600
It's what? Radiation, you know,

50:19.640 --> 50:22.280
from like a nuclear power plant
or something.

50:22.320 --> 50:24.000
Yeah, it can damage film stock
like that.

50:24.000 --> 50:24.120
Yeah, it can damage film stock
like that.

50:24.160 --> 50:27.560
See how the spotty pattern there...
um, what?

50:27.600 --> 50:29.360
I taught high school physics, OK?

50:29.400 --> 50:32.000
Hey, you know, they shouldn't
just be able to stroll into a place

50:32.000 --> 50:32.800
Hey, you know, they shouldn't
just be able to stroll into a place

50:32.840 --> 50:35.640
like that and have this happen.
I know. Know where it was taken?

50:35.680 --> 50:37.520
I don't know, but I can guess.

50:37.560 --> 50:40.000
Hmm, which makes me think.

50:40.000 --> 50:40.880
Hmm, which makes me think.

50:51.320 --> 50:53.160
Hey, Mark. It's Celine.

50:53.200 --> 50:54.600
I... I have a favour.

50:54.640 --> 50:56.000
Run a search on Penelex Corporation.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.560
Run a search on Penelex Corporation.

50:57.600 --> 51:00.240
That's P-e-n-e-l-e-x.

51:00.280 --> 51:02.240
From the mid '60s.

51:02.280 --> 51:04.000
I wanna see if it's connected
to Northeast Engineering
and Shipping.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.040
I wanna see if it's connected
to Northeast Engineering
and Shipping.

51:07.080 --> 51:10.160
It's a waste-handling company
and there may or may not
be something there,

51:10.200 --> 51:12.000
but if there is, if you could please
give me a call,

51:12.000 --> 51:12.240
but if there is, if you could please
give me a call,

51:12.280 --> 51:14.280
I would greatly appreciate it.

51:14.320 --> 51:16.120
Thanks. 'Bye.

51:16.160 --> 51:18.440
Hey, is everything OK? No.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.000
Is there anything I can do?

51:20.000 --> 51:20.560
Is there anything I can do?

51:20.600 --> 51:22.640
Yeah, you can come with me.
Let's go.

51:24.480 --> 51:25.480
Come on.

51:26.280 --> 51:28.000
Let me grab my jacket.

51:49.720 --> 51:52.000
So this is where you specifically
told Elliot never to go.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.760
So this is where you specifically
told Elliot never to go.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.040
Yeah.

51:55.080 --> 51:57.720
And your boss said to leave alone.

52:00.280 --> 52:04.000
I think they're dumping
nuclear waste into this old mine.

52:04.040 --> 52:07.440
What?! Yeah. And right now I can
either ignore it or get fired,

52:07.480 --> 52:08.000
and neither one is a good option.
So... I need more evidence.

52:08.000 --> 52:13.240
and neither one is a good option.
So... I need more evidence.

52:13.280 --> 52:14.560
I'll be right back.

52:54.920 --> 52:56.000
Mom? Mom?

52:56.000 --> 52:57.120
Mom? Mom?

53:34.560 --> 53:35.600
Mom?

54:08.320 --> 54:09.800
Hey, what are you doing?

54:19.840 --> 54:21.400
Hurry up. What do you mean?

54:21.440 --> 54:24.000
We gotta go. Let's go, let's go,
let's go. What's happening?

54:24.000 --> 54:24.400
We gotta go. Let's go, let's go,
let's go. What's happening?

54:30.120 --> 54:31.800
Come on...

54:34.160 --> 54:35.320
What do you think, huh?

54:40.600 --> 54:42.760
Mom?

54:43.920 --> 54:45.720
Hey, who's there?

54:53.480 --> 54:56.000
Willow! What are you doing?!
Trying to get your attention!

54:56.000 --> 54:56.440
Willow! What are you doing?!
Trying to get your attention!

54:56.480 --> 54:58.160
I'm not up there,
I am down here.

54:58.200 --> 54:59.720
Yeah, I get that. Did you dream?

54:59.760 --> 55:01.240
Yeah, but...

55:01.280 --> 55:03.520
What's going on? A lot.

55:03.560 --> 55:04.000
Get in here. Hide, hide.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.120
Get in here. Hide, hide.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.760
Get in. Hide.

55:09.800 --> 55:12.000
Ooh, a secret entrance. Hide! OK!

55:14.320 --> 55:15.880
Oh, this place is cool.

55:23.440 --> 55:26.840
I... didn't look at your photos.
Seriously, Willow.

55:26.880 --> 55:28.000
It's fine.

55:28.000 --> 55:28.760
It's fine.

55:28.800 --> 55:29.800
Guess you can look.

55:29.840 --> 55:34.320
You said hide, so I did.
Tell me about the dream.

55:34.360 --> 55:36.000
I... I saw a big guy
on a black horse, a set of scales.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.800
I... I saw a big guy
on a black horse, a set of scales.

55:40.040 --> 55:42.560
Famine, usually shown
on a black horse

55:42.600 --> 55:43.840
with a set of scales.

55:43.880 --> 55:44.000
He pointed to this tall monument,
big cross with a circle around it.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.440
He pointed to this tall monument,
big cross with a circle around it.

55:51.600 --> 55:52.000
Looks like...

55:52.000 --> 55:54.480
Looks like...

56:00.960 --> 56:02.800
Oh, that's a Celtic cross.

56:02.840 --> 56:05.080
So where did we find one of those?

56:05.120 --> 56:07.480
I don't know.

56:07.520 --> 56:08.000
I need to hit the library
or Gruber's.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.760
I need to hit the library
or Gruber's.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.800
What's that?
It's a antiques place.

56:11.840 --> 56:13.600
I think they open at... 10.

56:13.640 --> 56:16.000
Oh. I have to get these photos done
for my mom right away.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.480
Oh. I have to get these photos done
for my mom right away.

56:17.520 --> 56:21.840
Uh, might be important.
Wanna watch?

56:21.880 --> 56:24.000
Can I? Yeah.

56:24.000 --> 56:24.240
Can I? Yeah.

56:42.680 --> 56:44.680
Why's Sprocket dressed like that?

56:44.720 --> 56:47.960
So I might have
kind of had an accident

56:48.000 --> 56:49.880
last time I poured these chemicals.

57:06.400 --> 57:07.600
Hi, Mark.

57:11.320 --> 57:12.000
So they changed their name.

57:12.000 --> 57:12.600
So they changed their name.

57:14.240 --> 57:17.840
They changed their name
from Penelex Corporation

57:17.880 --> 57:20.000
to Northeast Engineering
and Shipping in 1974.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.240
to Northeast Engineering
and Shipping in 1974.

57:22.280 --> 57:25.200
They still involved in nuclear waste
removal and storage?

57:27.560 --> 57:28.000
Biggest on the East Coast. OK.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.360
Biggest on the East Coast. OK.

57:31.480 --> 57:33.400
Well, thank you.

57:33.440 --> 57:34.720
OK. 'Bye-bye.

57:38.200 --> 57:39.480
Watch this.

57:41.160 --> 57:42.280
OK.

57:47.520 --> 57:50.080
Whoa! That's actual magic!

57:50.120 --> 57:51.560
No, that's science.

57:54.840 --> 57:56.240
It... it's that place.

57:56.280 --> 57:58.880
It's Northeast Engineering compound.

57:58.920 --> 58:00.000
Yeah.

58:00.000 --> 58:00.200
Yeah.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.080
Do another one.

58:11.120 --> 58:12.720
Oh, boy... It's him.

58:12.760 --> 58:13.760
It's him!

58:13.800 --> 58:15.160
It's the warlock.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.000
Your mom took these photos?

58:16.000 --> 58:17.320
Your mom took these photos?

58:17.360 --> 58:20.080
Yeah. We have to warn her!

58:20.120 --> 58:21.400
And say what?

58:21.440 --> 58:23.920
That we snuck out
at one in the morning,

58:23.960 --> 58:24.000
and saw him get off
a hundred-year-old steam train

58:24.000 --> 58:27.480
and saw him get off
a hundred-year-old steam train

58:27.520 --> 58:30.920
at a disused station,
and then blast someone

58:30.960 --> 58:32.000
with his magic cane?
I won't be grounded,

58:32.000 --> 58:33.240
with his magic cane?
I won't be grounded,

58:33.280 --> 58:35.160
I'll be put in a home
for crazy people.

58:35.200 --> 58:38.640
OK, we just have to find
the rest of the gems and complete
the amulet.

58:38.680 --> 58:40.000
Meet me at Gruber's.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
Meet me at Gruber's.

58:41.040 --> 58:42.040
OK.

58:52.400 --> 58:54.920
Hey. What's up?

58:54.960 --> 58:56.000
Why are we here?

58:56.000 --> 58:57.200
Why are we here?

58:57.240 --> 58:58.760
Wait, wait, hang on.

59:00.240 --> 59:01.640
What is that?

59:01.680 --> 59:03.760
Patty... Pebble.

59:03.800 --> 59:04.000
Uh, looks like someone barfed up
a blob of pink frosting.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.840
Uh, looks like someone barfed up
a blob of pink frosting.

59:07.880 --> 59:10.000
Your barf has hair and googly eyes?

59:11.440 --> 59:12.000
OK, look, back in the '70s

59:12.000 --> 59:13.400
OK, look, back in the '70s

59:13.440 --> 59:15.960
they sold these big pebbles
for people to keep as pets,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.680
right? Uh, big pebble? Yeah. As pet?

59:18.720 --> 59:20.000
Yeah. They had cartoons
and trading cards.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.840
Yeah. They had cartoons
and trading cards.

59:22.880 --> 59:26.400
Whoa. This here is a mint condition

59:26.440 --> 59:28.000
1978 Patty Pebble limited edition.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.360
1978 Patty Pebble limited edition.

59:30.400 --> 59:35.240
Are you saying you've never heard
of the My Little Stony line of toys?

59:35.280 --> 59:36.000
OK, who are you, and where's Willow?

59:36.000 --> 59:38.560
OK, who are you, and where's Willow?

59:38.600 --> 59:40.680
Why are we even here?

59:40.720 --> 59:44.000
You see this? This is a map of
the town in the days of the curse,

59:44.000 --> 59:46.080
You see this? This is a map of
the town in the days of the curse,

59:46.120 --> 59:48.440
and it's lovely.

59:48.480 --> 59:51.240
It is pretty cool.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.000
What does it show us?
Look here, it's gotta be it.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.480
What does it show us?
Look here, it's gotta be it.

59:54.520 --> 59:57.560
It's in the woods
north of the old paper mill.

59:57.600 --> 59:59.480
How much does this thing cost?

1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:03.000
$1100?!

1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:05.280
Technology to the rescue.

1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:24.000
Patty, no!

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:25.280
Patty, no!

1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:29.080
Do you have a camera? Always.

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:32.000
Hey, Chad!

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:33.000
Hey, Chad!

1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:36.800
You little... Give me the camera!

1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:55.200
I cannot believe that guy!

1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:56.000
Hey, look who's talking. How many
of those things do you have?

1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.920
Hey, look who's talking. How many
of those things do you have?

1:00:57.960 --> 1:01:00.680
It's a hobby. But I mean,
he used to talk about the cartoons

1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:04.000
like years ago. Seriously,
I never knew he was still into it.

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.040
like years ago. Seriously,
I never knew he was still into it.

1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:08.560
OK.
We should get going.

1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:09.920
The Celtic cross. Yeah.

1:01:27.280 --> 1:01:28.000
Is it in there? I don't know.

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.160
Is it in there? I don't know.

1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:31.360
I can't get a signal.
Nah, forget it.

1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:33.800
Let's just go look. Willow?

1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:36.000
What? We still have two gems
to find, we can't stop now.

1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:37.400
What? We still have two gems
to find, we can't stop now.

1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:44.000
It's not like you to be scared.

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:44.240
It's not like you to be scared.

1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:48.720
Come on, seriously...

1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:05.040
Hello?

1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.960
I'm a witch. I'm not scared of you.

1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:24.000
Yeah, OK.

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:24.360
Yeah, OK.

1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:29.080
Hey, it's that way.

1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:30.520
What... what?

1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:32.000
''

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.840
''

1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:39.000
It's not like you to be scared.
Elliot, why would you even do that?!

1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:40.000
Hey, these last few days
you told me nothing

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.440
Hey, these last few days
you told me nothing

1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:44.480
except how spooky and weird
this place is.

1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:48.000
There you go with the weird.
Wll, I thought you liked weird.
I do, just... Hey,

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:49.200
There you go with the weird.
Wll, I thought you liked weird.
I do, just... Hey,

1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:51.240
did you say you have signal?
Yeah.

1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:53.080
Then let's go find this thing.

1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:00.560
Here it is, here it is!

1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:04.000
Great potato famine.

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.160
Great potato famine.

1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:08.760
"This monument is in remembrance
of the Irish immigrants

1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:11.320
who settled in the town
of Wickensburg in 1847

1:03:11.360 --> 1:03:12.000
after leaving Ireland to escape
the Great Potato Famine."

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.760
after leaving Ireland to escape
the Great Potato Famine."

1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:18.840
The Great Potato Famine. I remember
reading about that in history.

1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:20.000
It's a shame nobody keeps it up.

1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.360
It's a shame nobody keeps it up.

1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:23.920
OK, but now what?

1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:32.360
Hey. What... what?

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:33.600
It moved.

1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:36.000
Look at that. It must be.

1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.080
Look at that. It must be.

1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:52.000
Whoa!

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:52.160
Whoa!

1:03:57.160 --> 1:03:58.960
What is it?

1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:03.280
Green? Uh, Irish memorial, I guess.

1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:13.160
One left to find.

1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:16.000
What is it? It's a map.

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.520
What is it? It's a map.

1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:21.200
Yeah, and it's super-old-looking.
Uh, we should head back

1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:22.760
and look at this properly.

1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:28.080
Peter, do you have a minute?

1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:29.160
Uh, no.

1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:32.000
Well... just a minute.

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:32.640
Well... just a minute.

1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:34.360
Look at these.

1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:47.040
So do we still say this isn't
an industrial waste-dumping
operation?

1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:48.000
Celine - Don't worry, this was
on my own time,

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.400
Celine - Don't worry, this was
on my own time,

1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:52.040
but this is what I found
just from last night.

1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:53.120
Celine.

1:04:54.920 --> 1:04:56.000
How can you ignore this?

1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:56.520
How can you ignore this?

1:04:56.560 --> 1:04:59.280
Please! I need
the Founder's Day piece.

1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:01.000
You have it.

1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:03.080
It's in your email.
I sent it yesterday.

1:05:08.320 --> 1:05:10.800
Did you, uh, speak to Lou yet?

1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:12.000
No, because I don't know who Lou is.

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:13.080
No, because I don't know who Lou is.

1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:14.840
Lou Dodds.

1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:17.960
Didn't I send an email?

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:20.000
He lives over on Forest, number 27.

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:21.040
He lives over on Forest, number 27.

1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:23.040
Old friend of mine.
He organises the parade.

1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:26.160
Are you serious?
Oh, I am serious, Celine.

1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:28.000
I've asked you to do this
as a colleague.

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:28.760
I've asked you to do this
as a colleague.

1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:31.640
Now, as your boss, I'm telling you
to speak to Lou about the parade.

1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:34.760
I'm talking to him at lunchtime.
I'll expect him to have seen you.

1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:36.000
OK, you got it. Fine.

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.120
OK, you got it. Fine.

1:05:51.080 --> 1:05:52.000
I did what I could, OK? You're going
to have someone at the house
to meet her.

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:56.520
I did what I could, OK? You're going
to have someone at the house
to meet her.

1:05:56.560 --> 1:06:00.000
There was nothing else I could do,
right? I'll see to it personally.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:01.520
There was nothing else I could do,
right? I'll see to it personally.

1:06:01.560 --> 1:06:02.960
But...

1:06:04.040 --> 1:06:05.520
Is there something else?

1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:08.000
What... what are you gonna... do?

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:10.040
What... what are you gonna... do?

1:06:10.080 --> 1:06:13.440
Mr. Wilson, whatever happens
to that woman,

1:06:13.480 --> 1:06:14.520
you sent her there,

1:06:14.560 --> 1:06:16.000
you are in this up to your neck.

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:17.240
you are in this up to your neck.

1:06:17.280 --> 1:06:20.920
Pray it remains
attached to your body.

1:06:39.840 --> 1:06:40.000
What are you doing?

1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:41.000
What are you doing?

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:42.680
Checking we weren't followed.

1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:44.640
OK, get this.

1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:46.920
What? You know
what the fourth horseman represents?

1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:48.000
No, what?

1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:48.920
No, what?

1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:50.320
Death.

1:07:13.040 --> 1:07:14.200
Please, come in.

1:07:14.240 --> 1:07:15.360
Are you Mr. Dodds?

1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:16.680
No.

1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:18.280
But please come in.

1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:21.400
Thank you.

1:07:26.760 --> 1:07:28.000
This way, please.

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:28.320
This way, please.

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:36.000
I recognise you. You were
at the Northeast Engineering
compound.

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:36.280
I recognise you. You were
at the Northeast Engineering
compound.

1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:38.240
Well, I'm guessing
that we're not discussing

1:07:38.280 --> 1:07:41.440
the Founder's Day parade,
and I am very busy,

1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:44.000
so if you'll excuse me.
Um, yep, just like I thought.

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:45.360
so if you'll excuse me.
Um, yep, just like I thought.

1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:48.000
Please take a seat.

1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:51.120
Well, I am not one to refuse
hospitality.

1:07:52.680 --> 1:07:55.600
Mrs. Lucas, I am Mr. Hexenmeister.

1:07:55.640 --> 1:07:59.680
Hexenmeister. As in warlock?

1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:00.000
Very good, Mrs. Lucas.

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:03.240
Very good, Mrs. Lucas.

1:08:03.280 --> 1:08:07.160
Well, I knew those four years of me
taking German in high school

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:08.000
would pay off one day.
You're the owner of Northeast
Engineering and Shipping.

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.840
would pay off one day.
You're the owner of Northeast
Engineering and Shipping.

1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:12.200
I am.

1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:14.360
Formally Penelex Corporation.

1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:16.000
Few people have ever made
that connection.

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:17.120
Few people have ever made
that connection.

1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:20.560
You are a very talented reporter.

1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:23.520
Journalist.
Oh, of course, I'm so sorry.

1:08:23.560 --> 1:08:24.000
That's OK. Let's see how good I am.

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:25.560
That's OK. Let's see how good I am.

1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:30.480
In the late '60s,
Penelex won the contract
to dispose of nuclear waste

1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:32.000
from the new Shippingport atomic
power station in Pennsylvania.

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.480
from the new Shippingport atomic
power station in Pennsylvania.

1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:35.880
Go on.

1:08:35.920 --> 1:08:38.560
Instead of spending the money

1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:40.000
and disposing of the waste properly,

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:41.760
and disposing of the waste properly,

1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:45.320
you came across the legend
of the curse on Wickensburg.

1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:48.000
Radiation, poisoned the soil,

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:49.200
Radiation, poisoned the soil,

1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:51.960
damaged the crops, killed livestock,

1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.000
and people in the town
just put it down to the old legend.

1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:56.440
and people in the town
just put it down to the old legend.

1:08:56.480 --> 1:08:59.920
So you have told me
everything you know,

1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:03.960
and yes, you do know everything,

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:07.320
but it cannot become public.

1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:09.680
So you leave me no choice.

1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:12.000
Mr. Warlock, with all due respect,

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.360
Mr. Warlock, with all due respect,

1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:16.640
my husband was in the Air Force,
we travelled the world.

1:09:16.680 --> 1:09:20.000
I have interviewed everyone
from the mafia, drug lords,

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:21.160
I have interviewed everyone
from the mafia, drug lords,

1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:23.960
uh, terrorists,
and even politicians.

1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:26.760
And I'm supposed to be afraid
of you?

1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:32.120
I'm afraid of myself sometimes,
Mrs. Lucas.

1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:35.960
But now
we are going to take a nice drive

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.840
up to our new facility.

1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:40.680
But first, you must call your son.

1:09:42.600 --> 1:09:44.000
Hi, Mom. Hey, hon.

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:44.480
Hi, Mom. Hey, hon.

1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:46.440
Uh, listen, I'm gonna be away again
tonight.

1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:49.360
Uh, same thing as last night.
So can you please, uh,

1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:51.480
make yourself some dinner?
Yeah, sure, no problem.

1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:52.000
And don't stay up too late, OK?

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.320
And don't stay up too late, OK?

1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:55.320
OK. And Elliot,

1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:57.640
if you have any problems,
you call your Uncle John, OK?

1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:00.000
Uh... sure.

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:00.840
Uh... sure.

1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:04.040
And like I said,
same place as last night.

1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:05.080
Right.

1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:08.000
I love you. I love you too, Mom.

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:08.160
I love you. I love you too, Mom.

1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:09.600
'Bye.

1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:12.840
She's in trouble.

1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:15.360
What? How do you know?

1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:16.000
My dad was a pilot.

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:17.160
My dad was a pilot.

1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:20.600
Yeah? If someone
in the military was captured

1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:24.000
the bad guys might force them to,
I don't know, talk on the radio.

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:24.920
the bad guys might force them to,
I don't know, talk on the radio.

1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:27.320
Maybe trick a rescue team
into a trap.

1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:29.720
So if they're not free
to say what they want,

1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:32.000
they have code words to use.
Words like what?

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:32.080
they have code words to use.
Words like what?

1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:35.000
I don't have an Uncle John.
Someone made her make that call.

1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:36.920
Um, who?

1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:38.640
I don't know.

1:10:38.680 --> 1:10:40.000
Well, she wanted us to know

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:40.600
Well, she wanted us to know

1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:43.800
she'd be in the same place
as last night, right?
The old mine works

1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:47.080
where she took those photos.
The warlock guy was at the mine.

1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:48.000
So if your mom's there now,
he's the one who has her.

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.840
So if your mom's there now,
he's the one who has her.

1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:52.520
Gotta be. He's not a warlock.

1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:55.000
Come on. We can't. What?

1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:56.000
We have to find the monument
to death.

1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:57.080
We have to find the monument
to death.

1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:00.120
Every monument is just a monument
to someone who died. Come on.

1:11:00.160 --> 1:11:03.200
But we only have three stones.
So? It's just a piece of jewellery.

1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:04.000
What are we gonna do when we meet
this guy and all we have is this?

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:05.720
What are we gonna do when we meet
this guy and all we have is this?

1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:08.360
Nothing, it's a toy! Who cares?

1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:12.000
I... I thought you cared.
Willow... you're not a witch.

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.040
I... I thought you cared.
Willow... you're not a witch.

1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:16.240
He's not a warlock.
There... there is no curse.

1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:19.840
It's just a game made up by,
I don't know,

1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:20.000
the museum guy
who used to own his house.

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.560
the museum guy
who used to own his house.

1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:24.720
It's not real.

1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:27.320
This guy has my mom.

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:28.000
Do you get it? That's real.

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:29.560
Do you get it? That's real.

1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:31.000
Then you'd better go.

1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:00.000
This way, please.

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:00.280
This way, please.

1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.520
Uh, where's death, where's death?

1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:22.920
Where'd you bury people
300 years ago?

1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:33.840
Oh, boy.

1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:12.000
Hey, Chad, I need a favour.

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:13.440
Hey, Chad, I need a favour.

1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:16.800
Guys, uh, does it say "losers,
this way" on the back of my truck?

1:13:16.840 --> 1:13:18.760
So what are you doing here?

1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:20.000
Well, I thought
I'd tell your little buddies

1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.120
Well, I thought
I'd tell your little buddies

1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:25.000
about my collection,
since you're so keen on yours.

1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:28.000
My what? Hmm, your collection.

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:31.440
My what? Hmm, your collection.

1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:33.640
Guys, I'm gonna need a minute.

1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:42.000
What do you want?

1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:43.440
Hop in.

1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:45.480
Look out!

1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:51.240
(NEIGHS

1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:00.000
Hey, get up, we've gotta go.
Thanks, William. I'm fine.

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.440
Hey, get up, we've gotta go.
Thanks, William. I'm fine.

1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:03.040
I know where the last monument is.

1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:05.840
So do I, and what it looks like.

1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:08.000
Wow. And now we're even.

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:08.440
Wow. And now we're even.

1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:11.680
What?
Well, you've seen MY underwear.

1:14:11.720 --> 1:14:13.280
Hey!

1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:50.480
Did you know, Mrs. Lucas,

1:14:50.520 --> 1:14:52.560
that a sect of European colonists

1:14:52.600 --> 1:14:54.440
believed this place
had magic potentials?

1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:56.000
They may even have made sacrifices.

1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:57.360
They may even have made sacrifices.

1:14:57.400 --> 1:15:00.840
So take heart, when you die
down here,

1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:03.520
you'll be maintaining
a local tradition.

1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:06.800
People will be looking for me.

1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:08.320
No, Mrs. Lucas.

1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:12.000
Soon, my engineers
will fire explosives

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:12.680
Soon, my engineers
will fire explosives

1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:14.920
linking these tunnels
to the ones above,

1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:17.120
which contain
a hundred thousand tons

1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:18.640
of liquid nuclear waste.

1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:20.000
Nobody with a desire to live

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.520
Nobody with a desire to live

1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:25.640
will come down here
within a hundred million years.

1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:28.000
And your radiation-scorched bones

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:29.920
And your radiation-scorched bones

1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:35.520
will act as a silent warning
for every other nosy reporter.

1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:43.160
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Obarski here
reminds me

1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:44.000
that you are a journalist.

1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:45.840
that you are a journalist.

1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:49.240
Maybe this will make a good story.

1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:23.640
Well, that's new.

1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:24.000
Drive.

1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.000
Drive.

1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:27.440
I can't, there's a gate.

1:16:27.480 --> 1:16:28.840
We have to get in there.

1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:30.480
No way.

1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:32.000
No, it would total my truck.

1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:32.400
No, it would total my truck.

1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:37.720
Chad, I will give you
my blue-haired Rocky Rockwell

1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:40.000
from the '82 cereal packet giveaway.

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:40.440
from the '82 cereal packet giveaway.

1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:41.880
Does the voice box work?

1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:45.880
'Rocky Rockwell loves her cereal!'

1:16:55.200 --> 1:16:56.000
I'm sorry.

1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:56.520
I'm sorry.

1:16:58.280 --> 1:16:59.560
Goodness gracious.

1:17:14.720 --> 1:17:15.960
Where are we going?

1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:20.000
The cemetery.

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:20.120
The cemetery.

1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:39.800
You go first.

1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:41.800
No, you, you're the witch.

1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:44.000
Part-time, part-time,
part-time, part-time, part-time.

1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:44.840
Part-time, part-time,
part-time, part-time, part-time.

1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:47.440
Go, go.

1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:52.000
It has to be the one.
That's what I saw!

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.920
It has to be the one.
That's what I saw!

1:17:57.360 --> 1:17:59.000
Don't leave me.

1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:08.000
Oh. "Joseph Mays,
born September 2nd, 1831,

1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:11.400
Oh. "Joseph Mays,
born September 2nd, 1831,

1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:13.920
died April 5, 1886."

1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:16.000
Great, can we find the gem now?

1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:17.880
Great, can we find the gem now?

1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:21.400
I can't find anything.

1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:22.440
What about the map?

1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:37.560
Look, here's the graveyard.
Look, look at these letters.

1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:40.000
YMSA.

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:40.720
YMSA.

1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:44.560
Huh?

1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:47.920
YMSA. I got it, I got it.

1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:52.200
Look, "Mays." Oh.

1:19:01.400 --> 1:19:03.080
I did it, I did it!

1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:07.000
Cool! Oh. What's in there?

1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:11.440
Nothing.

1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:12.000
Absolutely nothing.

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:13.240
Absolutely nothing.

1:19:17.720 --> 1:19:19.400
Hey, check that out.

1:19:28.360 --> 1:19:31.520
This is the most amazing thing
I have ever seen.

1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:35.360
OK, now what?

1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:44.000
We have to get
all the way over here.

1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:45.480
We have to get
all the way over here.

1:19:45.520 --> 1:19:47.160
Uh.

1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:00.000
This has to be it.
We can't go any further.

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:01.920
This has to be it.
We can't go any further.

1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:03.600
But there's nothing here.

1:20:03.640 --> 1:20:05.400
Look everywhere!

1:20:12.560 --> 1:20:13.600
There!

1:20:20.520 --> 1:20:21.920
Just try it, quick!

1:20:32.200 --> 1:20:33.400
I don't believe it.

1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:35.800
Well, we've come this far.

1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:37.000
Let's go, come on.

1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:11.440
I think it's that way.

1:21:11.480 --> 1:21:12.000
Come on.

1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:13.320
Come on.

1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:15.200
Wait up, I'm coming.

1:21:49.440 --> 1:21:52.000
What is this place? I have no idea.

1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:52.800
What is this place? I have no idea.

1:21:56.040 --> 1:21:57.640
Mom?

1:21:57.680 --> 1:21:59.080
Celine, are you there?

1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:02.160
Mom?

1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:08.000
Mom?

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:08.040
Mom?

1:22:09.320 --> 1:22:10.920
Celine?

1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:12.760
Mom!

1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:16.000
Celine?

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.120
Celine?

1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:19.480
Elliot! What?

1:22:20.520 --> 1:22:23.120
Celine, hold on.
Mom. Thank you.

1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:24.000
Are you OK? I'm fine,
but we have to get out of here,

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.040
Are you OK? I'm fine,
but we have to get out of here,

1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:28.240
and I know how to get out.
Come on, I know the way out.

1:22:28.280 --> 1:22:30.440
Celine, you won't believe
how we found you.

1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:32.000
We have... we have this medallion,
and this map, and -

1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:32.720
We have... we have this medallion,
and this map, and -

1:22:32.760 --> 1:22:35.200
OK, well, I'm glad you found me.
Thank you. Alright.

1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:50.000
Going somewhere?

1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:55.560
Get out of our way. No, this place
must have its sacrifice.

1:22:56.760 --> 1:22:59.280
In the name of my ancestors,

1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:02.160
for the sake of 300 years
of suffering,

1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:03.480
I smite you!

1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:04.000
What is that, little girl?

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.400
What is that, little girl?

1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:34.640
Wow, Mom, the front page!

1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:36.000
Congratulations. Thank you.

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:37.160
Congratulations. Thank you.

1:23:37.200 --> 1:23:40.400
And your photo is pretty good too.

1:23:40.440 --> 1:23:42.560
'Morning. 'Morning.

1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:43.920
What?

1:23:45.600 --> 1:23:49.120
"Billionaire industrialist
Wilhelm Hexenmeister

1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:52.000
was arrested on charges
of dumping untreated nuclear waste

was arrested on charges
of dumping untreated nuclear waste

1:23:53.160 --> 1:23:55.640
under the town of Wickensburg."

1:23:55.680 --> 1:23:56.960
Wow.

1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:00.000
He's alive? Uh, sort of. They fished
him out of liquid nuclear waste.

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.840
He's alive? Uh, sort of. They fished
him out of liquid nuclear waste.

1:24:02.880 --> 1:24:05.800
It says, "The operation was exposed

1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:08.000
by former Chronicle journalist
Celine Lucas."

1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:09.800
by former Chronicle journalist
Celine Lucas."

1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:13.600
Wow, Mom, it says your name
right there.

1:24:13.640 --> 1:24:16.000
But El, how did you know?

1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:19.240
About what? Like what to do
with the camera flash.

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:21.040
Oh, well, I mean,

1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:24.000
I just figured
who wears sunglasses inside

1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:24.680
I just figured
who wears sunglasses inside

1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:28.280
other then a guy who's really bad
with bright light or a warlock?

1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:30.880
Uh, he's not a warlock.

1:24:30.920 --> 1:24:32.000
And I think
I'm maybe not really a witch,

1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.440
And I think
I'm maybe not really a witch,

1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:35.680
not even part-time.

1:24:35.720 --> 1:24:37.960
I... I could take a better picture
of you.

1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000
I mean, I kinda got something new
I'm doing.

1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:40.160
I mean, I kinda got something new
I'm doing.

1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:44.920
OK. Think of Patty Pebble.

# Some time to rethink this #

1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:48.000
# It's like
I'm falling and I'm sinking

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:51.040
# It's like
I'm falling and I'm sinking

1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:55.120
# What if I made the decision?

1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:56.000

are too instant?

1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:59.320

1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:17.200
# Cos it was instant

1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:19.640

# That I was thinking

1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:28.000
# Of you all the time

1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:34.160
# It almost seemed like

1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:36.000
# You tricked my mind

1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:36.360
# You tricked my mind

1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:42.400
# Into thinking

1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:44.000
# That I was blind

1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:44.760
# That I was blind
