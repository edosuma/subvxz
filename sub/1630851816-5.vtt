WEBVTT

00:44.461 --> 00:47.380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:47.464 --> 00:49.257
YEAR 1985

00:57.724 --> 01:00.226
OVERSEAS PUBLIC SECURITY HEAD OFFICE

02:38.116 --> 02:39.742
You can't enter the operating room.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.670
The patient is showing
signs of dissociative identity disorder.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.006
I think he also has PTSD.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.799
He's suffered memory loss.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.595
We'll see how serious it is
through further observation.

03:02.056 --> 03:06.978
The doctor says he suffered
a head trauma in the accident.

03:08.521 --> 03:12.317
So he can't remember the last few months.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.569
He can't remember?

03:16.070 --> 03:18.364
He needs sufficient rest to recover.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.242
Okay. We'll come back next time.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.912
And please call us
if his condition improves.

03:30.919 --> 03:31.878
Honey.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.296
Honey.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.716
-Honey.
-Are you awake?

03:40.386 --> 03:42.138
Did I fall asleep again?

03:43.097 --> 03:44.390
How long have I slept?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.935
The doctor says
you'll be sleeping a lot for now.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.854
It's natural when you're recovering.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.981
You're exerting yourself too much.

03:52.607 --> 03:53.983
You probably have morning sickness too.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.611
No, it's not that bad today.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.738
Gureum is helping me.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.699
I think the baby wants you
to get better quickly.

04:04.285 --> 04:05.578
I'm sorry.

04:06.537 --> 04:09.457
There are so many things
on your plate already.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.042
Honey.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.295
After you recover,

04:15.505 --> 04:17.590
how about we move to
my childhood hometown?

04:19.133 --> 04:20.301
To Saju?

04:22.262 --> 04:24.597
I'm not asking you to say yes right now.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.768
Did my coworkers say anything?

04:28.851 --> 04:30.520
No, not much.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.982
They just wish you a speedy recovery.

04:36.442 --> 04:39.028
They said they'll assign you to
another division after you get discharged

04:39.654 --> 04:42.073
since your current division
is very demanding.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.327
Have they already decided that?

04:46.411 --> 04:48.579
The doctor said that if I'm careful,

04:49.163 --> 04:51.374
there should be no problems
returning to work.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.376
Honey.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.087
It makes me feel like

04:56.754 --> 04:59.257
I was a useless member of my division.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.884
Don't think about that right now.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.471
I just want to raise our baby

05:05.555 --> 05:08.558
in my hometown where I grew up.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.894
Could you consider moving there?

05:15.356 --> 05:17.191
What's there to think about?

05:17.275 --> 05:19.193
If it's what you want, we'll do it.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.991
Let's move to your hometown.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.327
The three of us.

05:28.619 --> 05:29.704
Okay.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.467
YEAR 1999

05:55.980 --> 05:58.941
How do you feel?
Has the dizziness subsided?

05:59.692 --> 06:01.027
Yes, I feel better.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.741
How many days have you gone
without eating?

06:07.408 --> 06:08.576
You'll die, you know.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.787
You can't live without eating anything.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.664
Could you wait here for a second?
I'll be right back.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.091
You can snack on this…

07:53.598 --> 07:54.557
Hey!

08:23.836 --> 08:26.422
Change into that right now and wait.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.859
SAUNA

09:52.466 --> 09:53.467
Excuse me.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.387
How long do I have to wear this
over my head?

10:18.117 --> 10:19.410
Gosh.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.955
Who are you?

10:24.790 --> 10:26.459
What is this place?

10:26.542 --> 10:27.918
Just a minute.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.715
<i>THE CHERRY ORCHARD</i> BY ANTON CHEKOV

10:46.520 --> 10:47.647
What are you doing?

10:48.356 --> 10:51.192
You have to tell me what you're doing.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.797
Detective Choi, what the heck
do you think you're doing?

11:13.672 --> 11:15.341
What you're doing is illegal.

11:15.424 --> 11:18.386
Is the police allowed to
do this to people?

11:28.396 --> 11:29.772
You recognize this, right?

11:32.066 --> 11:33.275
The Youngjin sect.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.404
What goes on there?

11:41.450 --> 11:42.326
I don't know.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.037
Lee Kyung-jin, Lee Young-deok,

11:45.913 --> 11:47.123
and Jo Jae-young.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.708
They're all connected
to that place, right?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.962
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.004
And…

12:01.303 --> 12:03.055
You've heard this before, haven't you?

12:04.014 --> 12:05.307
What is this?

12:05.808 --> 12:07.059
Is it a spell?

12:08.936 --> 12:10.771
Does it trigger a certain reaction

12:11.605 --> 12:13.441
among certain people?

12:14.150 --> 12:15.776
Could it order someone to kill?

12:16.944 --> 12:19.238
But why doesn't it affect us
when we listen to it?

12:22.992 --> 12:25.327
Geez. You're really dense.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.745
And one last question.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.001
Who is Guru?

12:32.543 --> 12:34.211
Did Guru command you

12:36.338 --> 12:37.715
to commit those acts?

12:39.717 --> 12:42.219
How many times
do I have to tell you, Detective Choi?

12:42.303 --> 12:43.762
Those are all my questions.

12:44.346 --> 12:46.056
I've got a lot of time.
So let's take it slow.

12:46.807 --> 12:47.808
Also,

12:48.476 --> 12:51.270
if you change your mind
and decide to cooperate, call for me.

12:56.859 --> 12:57.985
That's Mr. Lee.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.529
He's here to facilitate our conversation.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.866
I'll return in 30 minutes.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.786
And we'll start from the top, all right?

13:18.797 --> 13:20.007
What's so funny?

13:21.467 --> 13:23.093
Guru is…

13:23.886 --> 13:25.221
truly amazing.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.392
Guru told me

13:32.603 --> 13:35.022
you weren't like a living person.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.651
You're completely different
from other people.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.152
Like a dead person.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.699
Guru said he's the only one

13:47.743 --> 13:50.120
who could save you, Detective Choi.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.374
But before that can happen,

13:54.333 --> 13:56.752
there's one procedure you have to undergo.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.671
I told you about it before.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.507
Detective Choi,

14:02.174 --> 14:03.801
you'll peel off my skin,

14:05.553 --> 14:06.887
pour hot water on me,

14:07.513 --> 14:09.056
and then spit on me.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.641
After that,

14:11.392 --> 14:13.269
you'll become a living person again.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.855
That's what Guru said.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.441
He was correct.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.443
I knew it.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.782
Look at what you're doing right now.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.365
Get up.

15:08.949 --> 15:09.992
Get up, you bastard.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.170
What do you see?

15:22.338 --> 15:24.256
-What?
-Tell me what you see.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.717
JO JAE-YOUNG

15:26.800 --> 15:27.927
A name.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.346
-Is that all you see?
-Yes.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.473
She's Jo Jae-young.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.725
The girl I sawed into pieces.
Isn't that her?

15:36.977 --> 15:39.021
LEE SHI-JUNG

15:39.104 --> 15:40.147
Who is this?

15:41.565 --> 15:43.776
-Tell me who it is.
-What's this about?

15:44.818 --> 15:45.778
CHOI KYUNG-JOO

15:45.861 --> 15:46.779
Answer me.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.448
Answer the question.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.241
Who is this?

15:51.325 --> 15:53.661
Lee Shi-jung. Choi Kyung-joo.
That's their names.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.455
-Satisfied?
-That's all you really see?

16:00.334 --> 16:02.378
That's how it looks to you, I guess.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.213
When I see that,

16:05.130 --> 16:06.632
I see people.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.261
And I also see their homes.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.722
I see the school they went to.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.684
I also see their families
that are waiting for them.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.645
And their unborn baby that died.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.069
Kim Hwan-gyu.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.655
Kim Hwan-gyu.

16:29.738 --> 16:30.906
Yes.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.209
And you're only talking about me, are you?

16:43.752 --> 16:45.170
You crazy bastard.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.186
Tell Guru this.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.647
That we should go to hell together.

17:09.695 --> 17:13.073
Do you really think
this interview is meaningful?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.784
Do you really think

17:17.077 --> 17:19.163
you can get the answers you want from me?

17:21.832 --> 17:23.542
Do you really believe it?

17:23.625 --> 17:27.546
You think you can solve
what's going on by asking me

17:30.174 --> 17:32.092
about stuff that happened a long time ago?

17:34.303 --> 17:37.681
We want to learn the truth.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.228
I find it odd
that you keep repeating that.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.648
Doesn't it sound dumb?

17:47.649 --> 17:49.568
The truth is out there and all.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.695
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.617
The results are all there is to it.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.244
It's meaningless to wonder

18:00.287 --> 18:03.916
what our purposes are
and how we got to this point.

18:04.708 --> 18:08.295
It's your way of coping.
You just want reassurance.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.547
That's your work process.

18:13.675 --> 18:17.846
I'm not enlightened at all
from what happened in the past.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.476
I just know one fact.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.898
That the future exists.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.778
I've been talking about that
for a very long time actually.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.822
You've been talking about it?

18:34.905 --> 18:36.073
To whom?

18:36.156 --> 18:37.825
I can tell you that.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.706
But I have a question for you.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.667
What is it?

18:55.175 --> 18:57.970
What is the real reason you came here?

18:59.304 --> 19:01.265
What's your real question?

19:09.857 --> 19:11.483
-Did you bring it?
-Yes.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.614
And you?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.992
-I brought it, of course.
-Nice.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.167
Oh, Lord. Buddha.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.461
I am grilling pork belly
at the break of dawn at school.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.255
Please forgive me.

19:33.338 --> 19:37.050
The book club member
always eats grilled pork belly

19:37.134 --> 19:39.678
with chilled spicy noodles.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.889
She must like to eat all sorts of food

19:41.972 --> 19:43.724
because she reads a lot of books.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.476
Hey, there's not enough.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.479
They say she eats a lot, you know.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.647
Okay.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.818
Hey. Come here.

20:02.534 --> 20:03.660
I'll grill it.

20:07.831 --> 20:08.790
Have one.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.752
Look here, teammates.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.962
If any teacher sees us,
we'll be in trouble.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.049
And if that happens, I'm going to run.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.928
Oh, gosh.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.931
We already have a bad reputation
at school as it is.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.934
If rumors about
what we're doing goes around,

20:27.017 --> 20:30.020
it'll be a black mark on my record
and derail my singing career.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.146
We have no choice.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.482
We have to do whatever we can.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.903
This is the only place where we can get
the 1987 school magazine.

20:37.986 --> 20:41.323
Are you sure Jae-young is talking about
our old school magazine?

20:44.868 --> 20:46.245
It's on the news, you know.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.081
The detective and his wife

20:49.915 --> 20:52.876
were found dead in their home.
And they say

20:53.877 --> 20:55.545
his wife graduated from our school.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.757
And she published the magazine
with Jae-young's aunt.

20:59.549 --> 21:02.219
They worked on the 1987 issue.

21:02.803 --> 21:05.639
The school magazine is our last hope.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.308
I'm certain it holds a clue.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.195
It lacks somewhat in the presentation.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.406
But it does look appetizing.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.041
There are only a few copies left.

21:34.793 --> 21:38.463
The high school and middle school
materials are mixed together.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.507
It'll be really hard to find.

21:42.801 --> 21:46.054
Anyway, get it done
before the morning bell rings.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.057
I won't forget this, sister.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.531
Hey, how much time do we have?

22:04.614 --> 22:05.574
About 30 minutes.

22:06.783 --> 22:07.993
Are you ready?

22:08.076 --> 22:10.245
Let's not waste time talking. Let's hurry.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.873
-I'll search the shelves.
-I'll go through the boxes.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.990
Hey, what are you doing?
Hurry up and help us find it.

22:47.574 --> 22:48.825
We don't have time.

22:49.409 --> 22:50.494
Foolish sisters.

22:51.119 --> 22:53.121
You start an investigation
by surveying the scene first.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.372
Come on.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.139
Gather around.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.022
The criminal is in there.

23:19.898 --> 23:20.982
Where?

23:21.066 --> 23:23.360
While you were in a hurry

23:23.443 --> 23:26.321
and going through the whole library,

23:26.404 --> 23:28.240
I noticed this ladder.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.283
Look at it. It's not in the right place.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.829
As if somebody used it just a while ago.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.206
So…

23:36.748 --> 23:38.875
-Hey.
-Hey, I haven't finished talking.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.670
Hey, hold it steady.
If I fall, I could break a leg.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.756
You surprised me, you know.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.384
I'm the one who found it, got it?

23:52.180 --> 23:53.473
It's really here.

23:55.475 --> 23:57.227
How did you know it would be there?

23:57.310 --> 23:59.604
As soon as I get to school in the morning,

23:59.688 --> 24:00.856
I always do my homework.

24:01.523 --> 24:04.067
So when I get home, there's nothing to do.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.819
I just read comic books.

24:05.902 --> 24:09.114
I especially like reading <i>Case Closed</i>
and <i>The Kindaichi Case Files</i>.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.407
So I've memorized all the issues.

24:10.490 --> 24:12.701
I'm a pretty good sleuth.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.953
But I find it strange.

24:15.829 --> 24:18.707
Why was the ladder set near the box
where we found the issue?

24:18.790 --> 24:19.791
It's elementary.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.961
A criminal always leaves behind
tracks at the scene.

24:23.044 --> 24:25.422
Criminal? There's a criminal?

24:26.256 --> 24:29.718
No, not a real criminal
or anything like that.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.429
-I mean--
-No. I think what you said is right.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.805
-This is it.
-What?

24:33.889 --> 24:35.891
Someone came here before we did.

24:37.225 --> 24:39.895
And that person
was also looking for this issue.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.396
I found it.

24:41.479 --> 24:42.981
Seven Secret Spots.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.528
That looks like Jae-young's aunt.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.656
Is it her? I'm not sure.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.657
It's her.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.662
Which one of them died?

24:58.455 --> 24:59.623
I don't know.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.417
Where do you think

25:03.877 --> 25:05.587
these people are now?

25:34.074 --> 25:35.825
Have you woken up?

25:39.079 --> 25:41.164
What have you done to me?

25:43.416 --> 25:44.626
We purified your soul

25:45.335 --> 25:48.004
from the outside elements
that seeped into it.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.048
We call it "cleansing".

25:52.801 --> 25:55.387
You think you have the right
to say such things?

26:02.060 --> 26:04.229
Rights are not given to us.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.356
We only believe Guru's words

26:07.107 --> 26:09.818
and those beliefs are embedded within us.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.156
What's so funny?

26:18.827 --> 26:20.120
I'm sick and tired of this.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.374
I don't care

26:25.625 --> 26:27.460
what nonsense you believe in.

26:28.878 --> 26:30.922
I don't care an ounce

26:31.756 --> 26:34.426
about any absurd plots

26:35.552 --> 26:37.178
you're hatching amongst yourselves.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.056
So…

26:42.100 --> 26:44.352
please leave my family alone.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.606
Where is Jae-young?

26:51.443 --> 26:53.153
You have Jae-young, don't you?

26:56.323 --> 26:57.991
We did have doubts.

27:01.536 --> 27:04.122
We wondered
how you'd be able to find this place.

27:06.082 --> 27:08.418
Although Guru always turned out
to be correct.

27:09.919 --> 27:11.212
This was

27:12.547 --> 27:14.090
a very astonishing experience.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.426
I don't want to hear it!

27:16.509 --> 27:18.678
Stop spewing nonsense.
Tell me where you're keeping Jae-young.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.223
You're in a very weak state.

27:23.558 --> 27:25.435
You've completely lost your way.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.689
Forget this obsession
over finding Jo Jae-young.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.859
That matter is out of your hands.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.112
You're lying.

27:38.573 --> 27:40.992
I wasn't certain until I came here.

27:41.868 --> 27:43.161
But not anymore.

27:44.287 --> 27:45.705
Jae-young is alive.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.417
And you are keeping her.

27:50.543 --> 27:51.503
I'm right, aren't I?

27:52.921 --> 27:56.383
You still believe you've found this place
of your own volition, don't you?

27:58.343 --> 27:59.469
Fine.

28:01.888 --> 28:04.474
What did you see before you came here?

28:06.393 --> 28:08.645
Did you remember your high school days?

28:09.312 --> 28:10.188
What?

28:15.985 --> 28:17.821
I'll be more specific.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.739
Do you recall it now?

28:21.366 --> 28:22.951
The school you went to.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.204
Your friends

28:27.455 --> 28:28.581
from the magazine club.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.127
Where are they now?

28:35.338 --> 28:38.174
It's not purely by coincidence
that we've all come here.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.222
This whole story begins
with you, old friend.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.312
Do you remember this?

28:55.817 --> 28:56.860
You do, don't you?

28:59.654 --> 29:02.449
With this camera,
we could all be embraced by him.

29:05.493 --> 29:06.578
You…

29:19.591 --> 29:22.177
You died.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.602
Jung-hyun, you did well by coming here.

29:32.395 --> 29:35.565
Are you really Young-seob?

29:36.191 --> 29:37.984
I have a story to tell you.

30:31.746 --> 30:34.290
-Are you all right?
-Oh, hello.

30:34.958 --> 30:38.378
Kim Hwan-gyu went into
the recuperating room a short while ago.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.506
You finished less than an hour ago, right?

30:41.589 --> 30:42.549
Yes.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.471
I pulled these files together
by asking the investigators for a favor.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.723
A lot of details
haven't been disclosed yet.

30:50.807 --> 30:51.683
It's such a fresh case.

30:51.766 --> 30:54.727
-I see. I'll take a look at it.
-Did you get anything out of him?

30:55.937 --> 30:57.188
We got one answer.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.316
You're not going to tell me?

31:02.026 --> 31:03.653
I'll tell you after I piece it together.

31:06.614 --> 31:08.157
Please understand.

31:11.786 --> 31:12.829
All right.

31:12.912 --> 31:15.832
And the commissioner gave us a week.

31:16.666 --> 31:19.961
We pulled this off even though
the special unit has taken over the case.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.797
Once our time is up,
we can't stay involved, you know.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.674
-You understand that, right?
-Yes.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.594
Kim Hwan-gyu will certainly make a fuss.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.138
It's just a matter of time
before this is leaked to the press.

31:30.221 --> 31:31.931
You don't have much time.

31:37.353 --> 31:38.229
Thank you, Chief.

31:39.355 --> 31:40.648
Don't mention it.

31:42.191 --> 31:44.360
Is Mr. Lee here?

32:26.277 --> 32:27.320
Welcome.

32:27.946 --> 32:28.947
Welcome.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.593
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

33:01.562 --> 33:04.315
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

33:25.086 --> 33:26.504
What do you want?

33:27.547 --> 33:28.631
Excuse me.

33:28.715 --> 33:29.799
Oh, I…

33:30.466 --> 33:31.843
I wanted to pray.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.220
Are you from Praise Team Four?

33:34.303 --> 33:35.430
-What?
-You are, right?

33:35.513 --> 33:37.765
The leader of Team Four
is giving me such a headache.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.809
He never gets the notice, you know.

33:39.892 --> 33:41.144
Oh, I see.

33:41.227 --> 33:44.272
Last time, we were supposed to
gather here and then leave together.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.357
But we had problems with the logistics.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.860
So you're supposed to
gather at Central Market.

33:48.943 --> 33:52.530
We have to do more work
because of people like your team leader.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.157
-I see.
-And Team Four members

33:54.240 --> 33:56.200
have been coming here all morning

33:56.284 --> 33:57.952
and giving me so much trouble.

34:00.413 --> 34:01.539
Wait here for me.

34:02.248 --> 34:04.584
I was going to cross over
after I finish up here.

34:04.667 --> 34:07.545
-So let's cross over together.
-Okay.

34:24.437 --> 34:27.815
Oh, I'm in the middle of the ritual.
Would you like to join me?

34:27.899 --> 34:29.067
No, I already did it.

34:29.859 --> 34:32.195
Then just wait for a little.
I'm almost done.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.191
Oh, I'm fine.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.764
To our honorable Saju citizens.

36:24.557 --> 36:27.643
We have invited a special guest
for the launch ceremony

36:27.727 --> 36:32.148
of the youth development committee
supported by Saju Market.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.441
Lim In-gwan!

36:33.524 --> 36:36.360
That's correct. Let me introduce him.

36:36.444 --> 36:40.239
The Chamsahwe Party for Saju.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.825
Committee chair, Lim In-gwan.

36:43.993 --> 36:46.412
-Lim In-gwan!
-Lim In-gwan!

36:47.038 --> 36:49.874
-Lim In-gwan!
-Lim In-gwan!

36:49.957 --> 36:51.417
Right.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.003
-All right. Marching forward.
-Forward.

36:54.086 --> 36:56.631
-Future.
-To Lim In-gwan.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.257
Right.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.092
Hello everyone.

37:00.176 --> 37:03.179
I'm Lim In-gwan,
a senate candidate for Saju city.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.975
I greet you again.

37:10.811 --> 37:13.731
-Lim In-gwan!
-Lim In-gwan!

37:13.814 --> 37:15.066
-Lim In-gwan!
-Lim In-gwan!

37:26.577 --> 37:28.579
LIM IN-GWAN

37:32.124 --> 37:36.128
You're talking about Senator Lim In-gwan,
who was elected in the local elections

37:36.212 --> 37:37.797
that were held recently.

37:37.880 --> 37:38.965
Yes, that's correct.

37:39.048 --> 37:43.844
We haven't confirmed that he's a member
of the Youngjin sect yet.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.850
Although the judge found him
innocent of all charges,

37:50.726 --> 37:53.980
support from the Youngjin sect
played a critical role

37:54.063 --> 37:56.440
in getting him elected to the senate
despite his past charges.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.317
Found innocent.

37:59.610 --> 38:00.695
Found innocent.

38:01.529 --> 38:04.532
He was charged for mismanagement
of the One Family Welfare Center.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.326
-That's the case, right?
-Yes.

38:08.744 --> 38:10.079
The court found him

38:11.455 --> 38:13.666
innocent of all charges in 1987.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.127
You also know a lot about the case.

38:16.210 --> 38:17.128
It's because

38:18.045 --> 38:20.464
I naturally heard
about the final court decision.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.216
Until then,

38:23.592 --> 38:26.512
my wife hadn't cut off
all contact with him.

38:28.931 --> 38:31.726
What do you mean by
her cutting off contact with Lim?

38:31.809 --> 38:33.269
Did your wife know him?

38:34.603 --> 38:36.063
Is that what you're implying?

38:38.441 --> 38:39.525
Yes.

38:41.485 --> 38:42.653
Lim In-gwan

38:44.280 --> 38:45.656
is the father…

38:47.450 --> 38:48.784
of my late wife.

39:00.921 --> 39:02.131
That's correct, sir.

39:04.425 --> 39:05.551
Oh my gosh.

39:13.642 --> 39:14.810
This is the venue.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.397
At full capacity,

39:18.481 --> 39:20.524
this stadium can seat 30,000 people.

39:21.359 --> 39:24.695
I'm hoping to fill the entire stadium.

39:25.821 --> 39:27.656
How have you been?

39:28.407 --> 39:29.950
You didn't come to the funeral.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.661
I couldn't bury my own child.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.955
I failed to protect her as her father.

39:36.749 --> 39:39.418
I've lost all purpose in my life
after I lost her.

39:40.419 --> 39:41.837
You look fine now.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.215
I tried

39:45.424 --> 39:47.468
so hard to forget my loss.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.179
But that didn't work.

39:51.138 --> 39:52.306
Then

39:53.391 --> 39:55.976
a savior appeared in my life.

39:58.979 --> 40:01.941
I now have a newfound belief.

40:02.525 --> 40:05.528
I found a reservoir of strength,
which I didn't know I had,

40:07.113 --> 40:08.739
to overcome

40:09.532 --> 40:11.283
any hardships in life, Hyung-in.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.120
Is the name

40:14.912 --> 40:16.580
of this savior, Guru?

40:19.708 --> 40:22.378
I was wondering
why you suddenly showed up.

40:24.755 --> 40:25.714
Yes.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.218
You and I are no longer close,
so to speak.

40:30.052 --> 40:31.095
Father.

40:32.513 --> 40:33.848
You're aware

40:34.557 --> 40:37.017
of the recent spate of murders
that have been occurring, right?

40:37.101 --> 40:38.185
Yes, I am.

40:38.811 --> 40:42.481
As a citizen of Saju,
I lament these recent incidents.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.024
I believe these murders

40:44.775 --> 40:47.862
are connected to a new religious movement
called Youngjin.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.321
Which means

40:49.822 --> 40:52.825
I think this individual called Guru
is also involved.

40:54.243 --> 40:55.411
So?

40:55.494 --> 40:57.705
I sense that

40:59.415 --> 41:02.168
you know something
about the Youngjin sect.

41:02.877 --> 41:05.963
If you would cooperate,
it would help with my investigation.

41:11.051 --> 41:14.597
How do you think you came here?

41:16.640 --> 41:18.559
You think you came here on your own?

41:18.642 --> 41:19.643
What?

41:20.936 --> 41:22.062
I feel like

41:22.938 --> 41:25.274
you're in a hurry.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.026
Father.

41:27.109 --> 41:29.278
What is causing you to be in such a rush?

41:29.987 --> 41:32.615
Is it because of
the kidnapping of that girl?

41:33.282 --> 41:35.326
Or is it because of the death
of your partner?

41:36.076 --> 41:36.994
Why?

41:37.661 --> 41:39.163
Is it making you enraged?

41:39.997 --> 41:42.291
Is that why you're snooping around
in all sorts of places?

41:42.374 --> 41:44.210
I don't know what you're getting at,

41:44.793 --> 41:45.878
but I think that's enough.

41:50.299 --> 41:51.550
You need to stop.

41:52.635 --> 41:55.179
There's nothing you can do.

41:57.932 --> 41:59.350
This is as far as it gets.

42:00.100 --> 42:02.228
Don't get involved anymore.

42:03.687 --> 42:04.730
Understand?

42:07.775 --> 42:09.401
There will be memorial ceremonies

42:09.985 --> 42:12.905
for the 1987 terrorist victims
everywhere around the city.

42:16.033 --> 42:18.202
Since you're on the campaign trail,

42:18.285 --> 42:20.496
I assume you'll be attending
such ceremonies.

42:22.206 --> 42:23.332
Of course, I will.

42:23.999 --> 42:26.126
As a citizen, it's my civic duty.

42:26.669 --> 42:27.962
I'm not sure I'll ever go.

42:28.712 --> 42:29.922
I've never attended

42:31.090 --> 42:32.841
any of those ceremonies.

42:34.301 --> 42:35.678
And the day of the ceremonies

42:36.345 --> 42:38.264
is the same date
I hold rites to honor my late wife.

42:43.727 --> 42:46.772
I don't know what each of us is pursuing.

42:46.855 --> 42:47.940
But I sincerely wish

42:48.941 --> 42:51.110
we're not on opposing sides.

YOUNGJIN BRAIN STUDY SCIENCE VIDEO

44:02.348 --> 44:04.224
Do you remember that day, Jung-hyun?

44:05.976 --> 44:08.312
A videotape was delivered
to our club room in 1987.

44:08.395 --> 44:10.189
We all gathered around to watch it.

44:12.232 --> 44:13.400
We didn't know about it back then,

44:13.484 --> 44:16.987
but his seed was planted in our souls
after we viewed it.

44:18.947 --> 44:20.949
That seed remains in our soul

44:21.533 --> 44:23.494
ever since it was planted there…

44:25.329 --> 44:27.998
until he lets it sprout within us.

44:29.541 --> 44:31.085
And a budding seed

44:31.919 --> 44:35.381
can turn into a tree,
a blooming flower, or a poisonous herb.

45:34.857 --> 45:36.525
All right, let's begin now.

45:54.585 --> 45:57.838
He has tasked you with a sacred duty.

46:00.716 --> 46:02.718
He also kindly led you here.

46:04.553 --> 46:06.096
He gave you a mission.

46:15.522 --> 46:17.441
Look at these faces, Jung-hyun.

46:20.402 --> 46:21.778
It's us.

46:24.156 --> 46:26.909
We carried out
the Saju station gas attack.

46:31.205 --> 46:33.290
We were chosen.

47:04.696 --> 47:07.866
And this is where history was made.

47:12.538 --> 47:13.830
<i>Kyung-ho, wait for me.</i>

47:14.456 --> 47:15.666
<i>I'm here.</i>

47:21.129 --> 47:22.965
This looks like an abandoned building.

47:25.217 --> 47:28.679
It was occupied just a few years ago.

47:28.762 --> 47:30.514
What was it used for?

47:34.893 --> 47:36.019
That…

47:42.985 --> 47:44.278
Impossible.

47:46.405 --> 47:47.739
It's really there.

47:51.285 --> 47:54.288
Kyung-ho, how did you know that?

47:55.038 --> 47:58.208
Why did you come here alone?

47:59.626 --> 48:02.879
You're not going to take pictures?
Isn't this what you were looking for?

48:04.631 --> 48:06.675
Answer my questions first.

48:07.509 --> 48:10.387
It's not to come
to a remote place like this by chance.

48:11.763 --> 48:14.099
Where were you for so long?
What were you up to?

48:18.353 --> 48:19.479
Did you perhaps…

48:21.356 --> 48:22.899
draw that?

48:22.983 --> 48:23.984
So

48:24.776 --> 48:26.778
all the things we found…

48:28.864 --> 48:30.073
were stuff you made?

48:32.159 --> 48:33.327
Jung-hyun.

48:36.747 --> 48:38.457
You ask too many questions.

48:40.626 --> 48:42.044
You just

48:43.211 --> 48:44.880
have to follow what I say.

48:46.673 --> 48:47.799
What?

48:47.883 --> 48:49.593
That's how it's always been.

48:50.927 --> 48:53.972
You wouldn't have been able to endure it
unless you followed me.

48:55.057 --> 48:57.225
What are you talking about?

48:58.560 --> 49:01.313
I don't understand a thing you're saying.

49:06.735 --> 49:08.362
Of course, you don't remember.

49:09.946 --> 49:12.783
You wouldn't know how it feels to be

49:15.035 --> 49:17.329
left in that dark room

49:18.205 --> 49:19.373
with no light or sound.

49:22.292 --> 49:25.212
You wouldn't understand it.

49:33.387 --> 49:35.555
You'll never know how it feels forever.

49:39.226 --> 49:40.477
Jung-hyun.

49:42.688 --> 49:43.980
Look at me.

50:04.710 --> 50:06.002
Look at this.

50:07.379 --> 50:08.463
Look at it.

50:13.343 --> 50:16.471
You just have to do as I say.

50:42.664 --> 50:44.833
This isn't a simple interview, is it?

50:46.376 --> 50:48.336
What is the question
you really want to ask?

50:50.672 --> 50:52.382
Should I say it out loud for you?

50:52.466 --> 50:54.885
Am I involved in
the kidnapping of my daughter?

50:54.968 --> 50:58.346
Do I have anything to do with
the murders or the Youngjin sect?

50:59.222 --> 51:02.559
What is the real purpose
behind these incidents?

51:04.352 --> 51:05.562
Am I right?

51:08.231 --> 51:09.483
Or maybe not?

51:12.569 --> 51:15.322
What you're really curious
about is this, isn't it?

51:16.198 --> 51:17.616
Who is Guru?

51:19.785 --> 51:21.495
Could I be Guru?

51:22.621 --> 51:24.164
Then please answer the question.

51:26.374 --> 51:27.417
Mr. Cho.

51:28.251 --> 51:29.711
Are you Guru?

51:29.795 --> 51:32.756
I guessed it correctly.
That was it all along, right?

51:34.424 --> 51:35.759
Mr. Cho.

51:35.842 --> 51:37.093
It's amusing.

51:39.471 --> 51:43.934
You already picked an answer,
but you keep asking the same question.

52:38.822 --> 52:40.156
Damn it.

54:37.315 --> 54:39.067
When I came in the morning,

54:39.693 --> 54:43.196
Aly looked really sick.
I came to check on him.

54:43.863 --> 54:45.156
I just got home too.

54:45.740 --> 54:48.159
-Seems like he's asleep. It's very quiet.
-I see.

54:49.119 --> 54:51.705
I baked some special treats for Aly

54:51.788 --> 54:53.748
since he wasn't eating his food.

PERSONAL INFORMATION

56:27.342 --> 56:29.803
After the first victim was found,

56:32.055 --> 56:34.265
so many things changed
in the following days.

56:37.352 --> 56:39.437
When my partner, Detective Lee, died,

56:40.939 --> 56:42.899
I lost control.

56:44.526 --> 56:45.527
I was

56:46.277 --> 56:47.445
on a warpath,

56:48.822 --> 56:50.949
destroying whatever I came across.

56:54.577 --> 56:58.248
I became paranoid
that people were scowling at me.

57:00.375 --> 57:02.460
It felt like
I was thrashing around in a trap

57:04.129 --> 57:06.047
that someone had laid out.

57:06.131 --> 57:07.340
A trap?

57:10.635 --> 57:12.303
Why did you think it was a trap?

57:14.681 --> 57:15.723
I had…

57:17.475 --> 57:19.227
a creeping feeling…

57:21.271 --> 57:23.398
that they were watching me…

57:26.985 --> 57:28.319
for a very long time.

57:32.449 --> 57:34.492
Oh, no. Aly.

57:42.959 --> 57:44.377
Oh, no…

57:45.962 --> 57:47.797
What are you doing, Mr. Choi?

57:48.465 --> 57:50.717
Come and give Aly one last hug.

58:00.894 --> 58:02.896
Oh, you poor thing.

58:02.979 --> 58:04.647
Oh gosh. Aly.

58:18.495 --> 58:21.372
Oh, you poor thing. Oh gosh…

58:22.499 --> 58:24.792
Aly. Oh my. I'm sorry.

58:32.926 --> 58:34.844
Oh gosh. I'm sorry.

58:42.936 --> 58:46.439
Oh no. Oh gosh. You poor thing…

58:46.523 --> 58:47.774
I'm so sorry.

58:53.154 --> 58:54.656
Oh gosh…

58:56.032 --> 58:57.367
Oh gosh. Aly.

58:57.450 --> 59:00.078
<i>They're watching me.</i>

59:01.746 --> 59:03.122
<i>They're entrapping me.</i>

59:05.708 --> 59:07.043
<i>They're calling me.</i>

59:09.879 --> 59:11.965
I had to end everything.

59:13.091 --> 59:14.425
In order to do that,

59:16.177 --> 59:17.720
I had to meet him.

59:20.014 --> 59:21.140
I had to meet…

59:22.642 --> 59:24.227
Guru.

59:24.310 --> 59:26.437
Who did you think was Guru?

59:30.441 --> 59:32.110
Let me rephrase that question.

59:32.652 --> 59:35.238
Have you met a person called Guru?

59:37.073 --> 59:38.074
Yes.

59:39.325 --> 59:40.952
You actually met Guru?

59:41.661 --> 59:42.662
Yes,

59:44.581 --> 59:45.999
I did.

59:52.839 --> 59:55.717
Let's try to use the quadratic formula.

59:55.800 --> 59:59.012
So we made the function here.

59:59.095 --> 1:00:00.305
You put a plus C here.

1:00:07.228 --> 1:00:09.731
You carry it over.
Then look at the next line.

1:00:09.814 --> 1:00:11.482
It becomes minus C.

1:00:11.566 --> 1:00:13.026
Now that it's minus C,

1:00:13.109 --> 1:00:15.695
you have x squared plus BX

1:00:15.778 --> 1:00:18.239
divided by A.

1:00:28.458 --> 1:00:31.336
Carry C over. It becomes minus C.

1:00:31.419 --> 1:00:35.173
Now we take out A.
We make them equal here and here.

1:00:35.256 --> 1:00:37.175
One side has to be squared.

1:00:37.258 --> 1:00:38.676
Now we're almost done.

1:00:40.803 --> 1:00:41.804
Sir.

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:44.015
What is it, Jung-hyun?

1:00:44.098 --> 1:00:45.933
Can I go to the nurse's office?

1:00:46.017 --> 1:00:47.226
Are you feeling sick?

1:00:50.313 --> 1:00:52.482
I got a cut on my hand.

1:02:58.524 --> 1:03:01.778
I'm going to do everything
according to plan. There's no more time.

…just embrace it.

<i>Let's proceed with the idea you had.</i>

1:04:18.938 --> 1:04:21.941
<i>He's much more dangerous

1:04:22.024 --> 1:04:24.193
<i>I wish that they will approach me.</i>

1:04:24.277 --> 1:04:27.655
