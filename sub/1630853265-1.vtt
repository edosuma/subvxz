00:47.240 --> 00:48.479
Thank you.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.520
- Phone in a locker.
- Ok.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.480
- Wait for the head warder.
- Ok.

01:15.680 --> 01:16.879
Cells?

01:17.519 --> 01:18.879
No, offices.

01:25.159 --> 01:27.000
Keep the pass visible.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.000
- Your first time inside?
- Yes.

01:48.519 --> 01:49.799
It'll go well.

02:01.599 --> 02:05.319
Based on a true story

02:09.919 --> 02:10.879
Hello.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.039
- Lieutenant.
- Hello.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.199
Mr Fortineau!

02:21.280 --> 02:22.639
- Coming?
- Yes.

02:22.719 --> 02:24.919
Your hat. Take the hat off.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.560
- I have sinusitis.
- Off!

02:33.280 --> 02:34.319
Good luck.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.120
Hand it over. 3 days.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.479
- I can't yet.
- You promised.

02:38.560 --> 02:39.800
I promised?

02:39.879 --> 02:41.159
I did 3 days.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.240
Hello.

02:42.319 --> 02:43.479
Cut it out, man.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.759
I'm the new theatre guy.

02:50.599 --> 02:51.719
And the others?

02:52.479 --> 02:53.840
In their cells.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.360
- Are they coming?
- No.

02:56.439 --> 02:59.000
Stéphane pissed us off
with his fables.

02:59.599 --> 03:01.680
- We want to do comedy.
- Stand-up.

03:03.599 --> 03:04.800
Hi, guys.

03:04.879 --> 03:07.360
- Mr Lazy!
- Hello, sir.

03:07.439 --> 03:08.560
Doing ok?

03:08.639 --> 03:10.039
- What's up?
- High?

03:10.759 --> 03:12.599
- Stoned.
- Look at his eyes.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.840
- Wasted?
- Yeah.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.759
- I'm Etienne, an actor.
- On TV?

03:19.039 --> 03:21.080
- Sometimes.
- Never seen you.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.439
C'mon, a star wouldn't be here!

03:23.520 --> 03:25.879
- We're doing stand-up.
- Yeah?

03:25.960 --> 03:28.599
I'm not into sketches, I do theatre.

03:28.680 --> 03:29.960
Comic theatre?

03:30.719 --> 03:31.759
That too.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.120
So you're a funny guy?

03:34.360 --> 03:35.360
Sometimes.

03:35.439 --> 03:37.719
- But you're tense now.
- I'm not.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.520
- You are.
- Good pay?

03:39.599 --> 03:41.280
No, look at his shoes!

03:43.599 --> 03:45.400
What brand's your bag?

03:45.479 --> 03:46.439
Oxfam?

03:47.080 --> 03:49.360
Alright, have you finished?

03:49.439 --> 03:51.919
Don't get upset, we joke a lot.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.520
Alright then...

03:53.599 --> 03:55.800
Show us your stand-up act.

03:55.879 --> 03:58.360
- Show him.
- Go on, wise guy.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.680
I'm not warmed up.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.120
Give us a laugh.

04:02.199 --> 04:03.360
Drop it.

04:03.439 --> 04:04.840
So who's funny here?

04:04.919 --> 04:06.800
- Jojo's the best.
- I'm not.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.319
You're the funny one.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.360
No one, then.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.079
The Hare and the Tortoise.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.680
Rushing is useless.
One must leave on time,

04:19.759 --> 04:22.040
as the Hare and the Tortoise show.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.360
I wager that you won't reach...

04:24.439 --> 04:26.360
- Sit down!
- Leave him.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.879
He made it all up!

04:28.959 --> 04:31.079
I wager that you won't reach...

04:32.120 --> 04:33.360
Sit down!

04:34.639 --> 04:35.600
Sit!

04:36.199 --> 04:37.120
He's trying.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.040
Your name?

04:42.120 --> 04:43.480
I'm Jordan.

04:44.199 --> 04:45.360
Learn anything?

04:45.439 --> 04:48.279
No, the other guy kept pissing me off.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.319
What fable?

04:49.839 --> 04:51.160
It was....

04:51.560 --> 04:54.480
- Dickhead.
- Shut up. The Lion and the Mouse .

04:54.560 --> 04:55.720
Can you recite it?

04:57.000 --> 04:57.959
No.

04:59.439 --> 05:00.360
You, then.

05:01.399 --> 05:02.439
Patrick.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.399
The Hare and the Tortoise.

05:08.079 --> 05:09.839
Worked in jail before?

05:09.920 --> 05:11.199
Yes, a little.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.120
- Where?
- Vaulx-en-Velin.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.279
There's no jail there.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.839
It was a young offenders' centre.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.079
Ok...

05:19.160 --> 05:20.560
It's not the same.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.519
I hope you'll do a good show.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.279
Five sessions aren't much.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.480
It's not easy, but be ready.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.920
There'll be sponsors,
a foundation for projects...

05:32.000 --> 05:33.160
Make it good.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.000
- Try to lure the others back.
- I'll try.

05:36.079 --> 05:40.319
Hopeless. They're like rocks
and want to do stand-up.

05:40.399 --> 05:42.439
- Motivate them.
- With fables?

05:42.519 --> 05:45.160
Fables are great, there's a moral.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.199
- It worked for me.
- So you say.

05:47.279 --> 05:49.480
- Always moaning.
- Not when I act.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.000
You said I'd be Lopakhine!

05:52.079 --> 05:54.439
Five years ago. Things change.

05:54.519 --> 05:57.279
I have auditions. Quit if you want.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.079
But don't come to me again.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.439
Hi, how is everyone?

06:02.160 --> 06:03.279
Welcome.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.279
How are you?

06:05.360 --> 06:06.480
Ok, Agathe?

06:09.199 --> 06:10.360
There's a lion.

06:10.439 --> 06:14.160
He's tangled up in a net,
and there you go.

06:16.199 --> 06:18.360
- That's all?
- There's more.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.759
He gets all worked up,
it's busting his balls.

06:22.839 --> 06:24.680
Then he spots a tiny mouse.

06:25.439 --> 06:28.199
- A mouse passing by.
- No, a rat.

06:28.279 --> 06:29.439
Screw you.

06:29.519 --> 06:30.800
A rat.

06:30.879 --> 06:32.639
"For pity's sake,

06:32.720 --> 06:37.560
can you help me
get out of this fucking net?"

06:37.639 --> 06:39.040
The mouse says,

06:39.120 --> 06:43.480
"No, are you kidding?
You're a lion, a warm-blooded reptile.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.519
You'll trick me."

06:46.160 --> 06:47.720
The mouse comes over,

06:47.800 --> 06:50.040
not totally at ease, like.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.879
She starts nibbling at the net.

06:54.600 --> 06:55.800
The lion gets out,

06:55.879 --> 06:57.199
really grateful.

06:57.279 --> 06:58.879
"Thanks a million!"

06:58.959 --> 07:02.000
He shakes her paw, hits the mouse

07:02.079 --> 07:03.600
and eats her, the fuck!

07:03.680 --> 07:05.639
Who says he eats her?

07:05.720 --> 07:06.879
Who says that?

07:07.199 --> 07:09.120
That's not how it ends.

07:09.199 --> 07:11.560
- The cat eats the weasel.
- It's shit!

07:11.639 --> 07:14.199
I read the story, that's how it ends.

07:14.279 --> 07:16.680
One often needs someone smaller.

07:16.759 --> 07:19.639
Thanks, Yoda.
I always learned big guys

07:19.720 --> 07:22.040
eat little guys, it's natural.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.959
- You're not wrong.
- Yoda...

07:41.879 --> 07:42.959
Hello.

08:06.560 --> 08:07.800
Very good!

08:07.879 --> 08:10.199
Once again, more warrior-like.

08:10.279 --> 08:12.560
Think of the competition, ok!

08:18.920 --> 08:20.120
- Hello.
- Hi, boss.

08:21.399 --> 08:23.040
You do the fables?

08:23.120 --> 08:25.519
- What's your name?
- Traoré, Moussa.

08:27.480 --> 08:28.839
You're alone?

08:28.920 --> 08:29.839
Yes.

08:30.279 --> 08:32.799
- Know one?
- The Milkmaid and the Pot of Milk .

08:33.960 --> 08:35.039
Alright.

08:35.879 --> 08:40.000
Perrette, a pot of milk
on a cushion on her head,

08:40.080 --> 08:42.120
was on her way to town...

08:44.159 --> 08:46.320
I've been waiting half an hour.

08:46.399 --> 08:48.399
And me seven years, man!

08:48.480 --> 08:50.279
I'm not here to wait.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.159
Make that fuck come on time!

08:52.240 --> 08:54.919
- All we do is wait.
- All the time.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.039
For visits, exercise, family...

08:57.120 --> 08:58.440
We wait for each day,

08:58.519 --> 09:00.200
then for that day to end.

09:00.279 --> 09:02.039
And we wait to get out.

09:03.039 --> 09:04.600
Got a fable about that?

09:08.559 --> 09:09.960
Your voice, deeper.

09:10.039 --> 09:11.159
I don't do deep.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.879
Deep blubber!

09:12.960 --> 09:14.080
It's breathing.

09:15.679 --> 09:19.080
Use the diaphragm,
it's what helps you breathe.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.840
Put your hand here.

09:20.919 --> 09:22.399
I relax my belly...

09:26.159 --> 09:27.480
That's a gnu now!

09:28.799 --> 09:29.720
Try it.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.960
Relax. Now do a cow.

09:36.039 --> 09:37.080
Relax your belly.

09:38.639 --> 09:39.559
Relax it.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.200
Let out your breath.

09:41.279 --> 09:43.679
This is too weird!
I look dumb.

09:43.759 --> 09:44.679
You suck!

09:45.200 --> 09:46.720
Breathing matters.

09:46.799 --> 09:50.279
When you're on stage,
the diaphragm is at work.

10:05.879 --> 10:08.360
2 WEEKS

10:08.440 --> 10:09.679
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:09.759 --> 10:11.559
The Hare and the Tortoise.

10:12.600 --> 10:13.639
Rushing is useless.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.120
One must leave on time

10:16.200 --> 10:18.480
as the Hare and the Tortoise show.

10:18.559 --> 10:20.399
Isis, what's in the bag?

10:20.480 --> 10:21.399
Madam Tortoise...

10:22.159 --> 10:23.279
This sucks!

10:24.519 --> 10:25.639
"Let's wager..."

10:26.919 --> 10:31.279
You will not reach the goal
sooner than me.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.159
"You must be mad,"

10:33.879 --> 10:35.799
quipped the light-footed one.

10:35.879 --> 10:37.360
Mr Hare...

10:40.720 --> 10:44.000
Since he had time to nibble grass,

10:44.080 --> 10:45.320
to sleep,

10:45.399 --> 10:47.120
to listen to the wind, he let

10:47.200 --> 10:49.639
the tortoise advance
at her steady pace.

10:50.159 --> 10:52.039
Not bad for such philistines.

10:52.879 --> 10:54.879
Bravo, you did well.

10:55.759 --> 10:58.200
I could invite them to my theatre.

10:59.519 --> 11:01.200
I'm kidding, of course.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.039
Hi, Dad, it's me.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.879
I thought you'd forgotten me.

11:18.759 --> 11:20.559
C'mon, I'm calling you.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.639
- What are you doing?
- Eating.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.799
How about work-wise?

11:24.879 --> 11:28.799
Not a lot. Just stuff to pay the bills.
And you?

11:29.440 --> 11:34.080
Great, I found a job in a restaurant.
I'll be working weekends.

11:34.159 --> 11:35.679
That's good.

11:35.759 --> 11:37.879
You'll still visit your old dad?

11:37.960 --> 11:40.919
It's kind of tricky right now,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.600
but I'm seeing Mom in Partage de Midi.
Want to come?

11:44.679 --> 11:46.440
I'm not keen on Claudel...

11:46.519 --> 11:49.600
Come, please.
It'd make her so happy.

11:51.399 --> 11:53.080
Would Tuesday suit you?

11:54.279 --> 11:55.679
Earth to Dad...

11:57.360 --> 11:59.639
I don't know. I'll call you.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.639
Keep me posted.
I'm counting on you to come.

12:05.279 --> 12:07.279
- Ok.
-Love you.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.279
- Love you too.
- Tuesday, ok?

12:11.919 --> 12:14.080
It's a pretty riverside spot.

12:14.159 --> 12:15.639
Just tidy it up.

12:15.720 --> 12:18.080
Raze these old buildings.

12:18.159 --> 12:20.960
Raze the old house
and the cherry orchard.

12:21.039 --> 12:22.960
- The cherry orchard?
- Turn.

12:23.039 --> 12:25.080
My dear, you don't realize.

12:25.159 --> 12:28.000
The most remarkable thing around here

12:28.639 --> 12:30.120
is our cherry orchard.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.320
It's only remarkable for its size.

12:34.759 --> 12:35.960
It only gives...

12:37.559 --> 12:40.200
cherries every two years.

12:40.279 --> 12:42.039
- What's next?
- No idea.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.519
And when it does,

12:43.919 --> 12:45.279
we have a glut.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.480
Why're you here?

12:46.559 --> 12:47.720
Ask if you need help.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.799
I'm doing fine, thanks.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.200
- Here?
- Where else?

12:52.279 --> 12:55.720
- The programme's full.
- You close on Mondays.

12:55.799 --> 12:58.399
- I rest on Mondays.
- Rest later.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.440
This could be huge.

13:00.519 --> 13:03.759
Waiting for Godot
by prisoners discovering Beckett.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.720
They're not actors.
And you don't direct.

13:06.799 --> 13:08.759
Give me six months.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.919
Six months for Godot ?
Really?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.440
Reread it, it was written for them.

13:13.519 --> 13:15.399
They know about waiting.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.320
They're tragic and burlesque too,
the lot.

13:18.399 --> 13:20.120
But not talented.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.360
You said the other day
how they surprised you!

13:23.440 --> 13:26.799
Not one of your actors surprises me!

13:26.879 --> 13:28.360
- Quiet...
- You said,

13:28.440 --> 13:30.399
"We can't do what they do."

13:30.480 --> 13:32.159
- I didn't.
- You did.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.919
With different words.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.279
You're too much.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.639
- Have you asked Ariane?
- She's all for it.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.399
The judge too, everyone.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.679
- It depends on you.
- What can I say? Maybe.

13:43.759 --> 13:45.000
I'm rehearsing!

13:45.080 --> 13:48.080
What'll it cost you?
Give me one Monday!

13:48.159 --> 13:50.159
You're hurting me. Are you nuts?

13:50.799 --> 13:52.000
We'll talk about it.

13:53.639 --> 13:55.519
- Tomorrow then.
- Not tomorrow.

13:57.360 --> 13:58.919
I agree in principle.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.799
But calm down.

14:00.879 --> 14:02.679
You never change.

14:02.759 --> 14:03.960
Your stage costume?

14:04.919 --> 14:05.879
Yeah, why?

14:06.559 --> 14:08.480
Good pockets for your lines.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.840
Ok, bye.

14:10.919 --> 14:12.120
Yeah, bye.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.960
- See you Monday.
- Right.

14:14.039 --> 14:15.080
Agathe!

14:15.159 --> 14:17.000
Take how many out?

14:17.080 --> 14:18.639
Five, no more.

14:18.720 --> 14:19.919
In 6 months.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.440
So, six months of rehearsals?

14:22.519 --> 14:24.960
Exactly.
3 times a week. At first.

14:25.039 --> 14:26.960
- How many hours?
- 338.

14:27.039 --> 14:28.679
For 5 prisoners?

14:28.759 --> 14:31.360
- How can I justify that?
- Easy.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.759
They'll represent all the others.

14:34.360 --> 14:35.919
Fables are fine,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.799
but we can do better.

14:37.879 --> 14:39.639
Imagine the impact.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.879
- It'll be huge.
- Stéphane agrees?

14:41.960 --> 14:44.399
He loves it.
We can use his theatre.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.440
Exit permits are hard to get.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.080
The sentencing judge has to decide.

14:49.720 --> 14:50.879
She's no theatre fan.

14:51.519 --> 14:52.440
I'll talk to her.

14:53.000 --> 14:53.919
No.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.399
Let me handle it.

14:58.919 --> 15:01.200
So what do you want to stage?

15:01.279 --> 15:05.039
Samuel Beckett,
the 20th century's greatest playwright.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.799
- He's dead?
- 30 years ago.

15:06.879 --> 15:09.720
Waiting for Godot
is the absurd masterpiece.

15:09.799 --> 15:11.919
It's been staged worldwide.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.200
- In Arabic?
- Yes. Arabic, Chinese...

15:14.279 --> 15:15.480
- Sure.
- It's true.

15:15.559 --> 15:18.039
- Freaky eyes.
- The guy's a genius.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.080
- Those eyes...
- What a face.

15:20.639 --> 15:22.159
He won the Nobel Prize.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.480
Wasn't it...
What's the cocksucker's name?

15:25.559 --> 15:27.559
Einstein won the Nobel Prize.

15:27.639 --> 15:30.120
- He did too.
- Screw the Nobel Prize.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.559
Nobel Prize, respect.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.840
- No Ballon d'Or.
- I'll read.

15:33.919 --> 15:37.399
You said it's absurd.
So we do something meaningless?

15:37.480 --> 15:39.840
It's a play about life's absurdity.

15:39.919 --> 15:42.639
When you wake up, don't you wonder

15:42.720 --> 15:44.679
what your life here means?

15:45.440 --> 15:47.399
I smoke a big spliff and chill.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.919
If you start thinking,
you won't see the day out.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
You blow a fuse.
Life isn't here, it's outside.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.600
This is an interlude.

15:55.679 --> 15:56.919
A shitty interlude.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.879
Life can be absurd outside.

15:58.960 --> 16:03.679
Yeah, it's absurd,
but I'd rather be absurd outside

16:03.759 --> 16:05.360
than unabsurd inside.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.559
You understand.

16:06.639 --> 16:08.840
Hey, Etienne, I don't smoke.

16:08.919 --> 16:11.000
Let's work. Move the table.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.799
- Let's go.
- We can't.

16:14.559 --> 16:15.679
Why not?

16:16.559 --> 16:17.879
We're waiting for Godot.

16:23.679 --> 16:25.960
You're sure it was here?

16:26.639 --> 16:27.559
What?

16:27.879 --> 16:28.879
Where we wait.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.279
He said by the tree.
See any others?

16:31.360 --> 16:32.279
What is it?

16:32.840 --> 16:34.080
I don't know. A willow.

16:34.799 --> 16:36.399
Where are the leaves?

16:36.480 --> 16:38.200
Vladimir and Estragon go on.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.559
Estragon? That's a spice!

16:40.639 --> 16:43.200
- Can we change the name?
- No. You now.

16:43.279 --> 16:44.879
I don't get it.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.080
The guy, Godot,
does he turn up at the end?

16:48.159 --> 16:51.159
No, he sends a kid to say he can't come.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.679
- Why not?
- It's a mystery.

16:53.759 --> 16:55.000
They wait in vain.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.759
Why don't they call him?

16:56.840 --> 16:58.000
No phones then.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.679
They're weird, staying.

16:59.759 --> 17:02.279
They stay because it's absurd.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.000
- Maybe he'll give them work.
- That's hope.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.039
You wait.
That's why I'm in France

17:08.119 --> 17:09.519
and want to stay.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.559
The day you get out,

17:11.640 --> 17:13.599
it's back to Ouagadougou.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.000
Hope is absurd.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.519
- It's absurd.
- So what do they do?

17:17.599 --> 17:19.799
They talk and argue like you.

17:19.880 --> 17:23.039
Pozzo arrives
with his servant Lucky on a rope.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.079
This is trippy. Are you high?

17:25.160 --> 17:28.880
You wanted a fable
on guys who do nothing but wait.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.759
- Fables have animals.
- We're all animals.

17:31.839 --> 17:34.400
Wild beasts,
that's why they caged us.

17:36.599 --> 17:38.799
What's the moral of this fable?

17:38.880 --> 17:41.039
- There isn't one.
- No moral, no action,

17:41.119 --> 17:43.559
no beginning, no end, nothing!

17:43.640 --> 17:44.839
Cos it's absurd.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.039
Yes, and it's a comedy.

17:47.119 --> 17:49.680
They're funny, they're clowns.

17:49.759 --> 17:51.440
Let's take a vote.

17:51.519 --> 17:53.160
No, no voting.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.680
If you don't like it,
stay in your cell.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.480
Screw this.

17:57.559 --> 17:59.720
Listen to what he says.

17:59.799 --> 18:01.559
You have to try it.

18:01.640 --> 18:02.759
Etienne...

18:02.839 --> 18:05.680
- What's in it for us?
- Nothing. It's absurd.

18:05.759 --> 18:08.160
Give us a break.
Aren't you going?

18:08.240 --> 18:10.359
Do we get reduced sentences?

18:10.920 --> 18:12.279
Not my decision.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.039
You'll be proud of yourselves.

18:17.119 --> 18:18.279
Back out now

18:18.359 --> 18:20.559
or commit to 6 months straight.

18:20.640 --> 18:21.680
Are you in?

18:23.200 --> 18:24.119
Jordan?

18:27.799 --> 18:29.640
- No?
- Yes.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.359
We'll be using
a real theatre.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.640
You'll perform,

18:36.720 --> 18:39.119
with sets, lights, costumes...

18:39.200 --> 18:42.680
There'll be an audience:
your friends and family.

18:44.119 --> 18:45.680
But you'll need to work,

18:46.359 --> 18:48.279
work hard, learn your lines,

18:49.440 --> 18:50.680
stay focused

18:50.759 --> 18:52.519
and never lose heart.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.680
Do you trust me?

19:15.799 --> 19:19.480
Susie sitting in a shoe shine shop.
Where she sits...

19:19.559 --> 19:21.200
She shines.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.119
You be the tree.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.880
- A cherry tree?
- Fine.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.920
Use your arms as branches.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.319
- Why move?
- The wind.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.839
No, it's sunny, birds sing...

19:36.640 --> 19:40.440
The thirty-three thieves fought...
thought...

19:41.400 --> 19:42.319
What the hell?

19:51.440 --> 19:52.519
Nice cook...

19:52.599 --> 19:54.440
Nice cook... Nice cock...

19:56.640 --> 19:59.680
Eddie edited it, Eddie edited it...

19:59.759 --> 20:01.359
A bough? I wouldn't trust it.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.319
- We can always try.
- Go ahead.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.440
- After you.
- No, you first.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.759
Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.

20:10.519 --> 20:12.640
- Try it slowly.
- I just did.

20:12.720 --> 20:15.160
Eddie edited it!

20:16.599 --> 20:18.079
Etienne!

20:18.720 --> 20:19.799
No worries.

20:19.880 --> 20:24.079
The thirty-three thieves
thrilled the tone... throne...

20:27.119 --> 20:29.799
Was I sleeping,
while the others suffered?

20:30.559 --> 20:32.200
Am I sleeping now?

20:33.200 --> 20:35.519
Tomorrow, when I wake,

20:35.599 --> 20:37.359
what shall I say of today?

20:39.359 --> 20:42.319
1 MONTH

20:42.400 --> 20:43.359
It hurts?

20:43.920 --> 20:45.319
He asks if it hurts!

20:45.400 --> 20:47.119
Talk to us, not the paper!

20:47.200 --> 20:48.160
Talk to us.

20:48.759 --> 20:49.880
You know the lines.

20:50.759 --> 20:52.279
Start from "hurts".

20:52.359 --> 20:53.440
It hurts?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.200
He asks if it hurts!

20:55.279 --> 20:57.680
- Better, huh?
- Yes, but don't stop.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.839
Shut up and listen.

21:01.839 --> 21:02.839
Go on.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.799
No one ever suffers but you.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.200
I don't count.

21:06.279 --> 21:10.079
I'd like to hear what you'd say
if you had what I have.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.480
You're angry. Don't laugh.

21:12.559 --> 21:14.880
Angry, ok.
Think of your life here.

21:15.640 --> 21:19.359
A pal comes to visit and complains.
"It's tough..."

21:19.920 --> 21:21.000
You're in jail!

21:21.079 --> 21:22.799
How do you answer?

21:22.880 --> 21:25.920
I'd like to hear what you'd say
in my shoes.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
- True.
- So find the truth in your life.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.920
The truth is in your lives.

21:31.559 --> 21:33.759
Jordan, get it?
Truth in your lives.

21:34.359 --> 21:35.480
I never get visits.

21:36.359 --> 21:37.799
Time's up, gents.

21:38.440 --> 21:39.559
Not until 6 pm.

21:39.640 --> 21:40.559
In cells by 6.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.119
Alright.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.559
Remember to learn your lines.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.759
I mean it, Nabil.

21:49.559 --> 21:50.559
Boss...

21:51.119 --> 21:52.400
Thanks for Vladimir.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.559
What did you do before?

21:55.200 --> 21:58.480
I sold books. Novels, literature...

21:58.559 --> 22:00.359
- In a bookstore?
- No.

22:00.759 --> 22:02.519
Outside hotels.

22:02.599 --> 22:04.400
- Like a dealer.
- Yes.

22:04.480 --> 22:05.960
Only I dealt in stories.

22:06.519 --> 22:08.480
- It's not why you're here?
- No.

22:09.599 --> 22:12.720
I fought with an Afghan
and it ended badly.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.680
Mr Traoré, it's time.

22:14.759 --> 22:16.079
Off you go.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.039
- Good luck.
- Goodbye.

22:20.559 --> 22:21.799
Excuse me, sir.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.359
Can I have a word?

22:26.880 --> 22:28.000
I wanted to say

22:28.079 --> 22:29.880
I saw your fable show.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.599
It was fantastic.

22:32.279 --> 22:34.839
- Thanks.
- I really mean it.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.000
I hear you're putting on
Waiting for Godot

22:39.079 --> 22:41.519
by Mr Samuel Beckett.
- You know it?

22:42.119 --> 22:44.319
I know everything here.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.400
Got a part for me?

22:46.960 --> 22:50.200
- No, I have my cast.
- Try auditioning me.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.880
Let's not waste our time
on vain speeches.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.759
Let us do something
as the opportunity arises.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.319
It's not every day
that we're needed.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.720
You've read it?

23:00.799 --> 23:03.079
- In one go.
- Pity...

23:03.160 --> 23:04.519
It's too late now.

23:04.599 --> 23:05.920
Never mind.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.359
Things can change around here.

23:10.559 --> 23:12.839
You have my number.
My prisoner number.

23:14.759 --> 23:16.880
I'm Kamel! Kamel Beckett!

23:19.839 --> 23:21.039
We finish at 6.

23:22.079 --> 23:24.440
But they come for them at 5:30.

23:24.519 --> 23:26.480
I did 45 minutes today!

23:26.559 --> 23:28.880
Things take time in prison.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.319
Tell the warders to be on time.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.599
They have a lot to deal with.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.839
Visits, exercise periods, sport...

23:37.519 --> 23:39.759
- Always on the move.
- I'll start at 3.

23:39.839 --> 23:42.519
- No budget for that.
- So what do I do?

23:42.599 --> 23:45.200
Have you picked the right play?

23:45.279 --> 23:48.000
I read it and you're aiming very high.

23:48.079 --> 23:52.200
After fables, tales?
Puss in Boots, Red Riding Hood ?

23:52.279 --> 23:53.680
Oh, please...

23:53.759 --> 23:56.880
- I don't want them to fail.
- Me neither.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.319
I'll lift them up.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.880
I need an extra hour.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.000
I'll see what I can do.

24:04.359 --> 24:05.279
Thank you.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.400
- Ok?
- Yeah, and you?

24:13.480 --> 24:17.240
- Fine. Where's Jordan?
- Dunno.

24:17.319 --> 24:18.599
- Where is he?
- No idea.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.440
Finished, sir?

24:22.519 --> 24:23.599
Yes.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.079
Let's get started.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.759
A drunken Englishman
goes to a brothel.

24:27.839 --> 24:30.119
The bawd offers him a fair one,

24:30.200 --> 24:33.000
a dark one or a red- haired one.
- Good! Exit.

24:33.079 --> 24:34.119
The wings.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.279
Follow but stay here.

24:36.359 --> 24:37.720
Come back, Moussa.

24:37.799 --> 24:41.000
Excuse me. Can you sit?
Have you finished?

24:41.079 --> 24:42.119
That's better.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.119
The script.

24:44.839 --> 24:45.880
This is over.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.000
Speak louder, it's a big theatre.

24:48.599 --> 24:49.880
So project.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.440
Let's carry on.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.119
You wanted to talk?
You had something to say?

24:55.200 --> 24:57.440
- I've nothing to say.
- You're angry?

24:58.000 --> 24:59.759
A beat. You're angry?

24:59.839 --> 25:00.920
A beat...

25:01.480 --> 25:03.960
Forgive me . Another beat.
Take your time.

25:04.480 --> 25:05.519
You know time here.

25:06.279 --> 25:07.400
Go on.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.319
- You're angry?
- No.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.400
That's my line!

25:10.480 --> 25:12.079
The tone was right.

25:12.680 --> 25:13.720
Very real.

25:13.799 --> 25:14.720
Carry on.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.480
Forgive me.

25:16.559 --> 25:17.799
Come on, Didi.

25:17.880 --> 25:20.599
Your hand. Embrace me.
Are they gay?

25:20.680 --> 25:22.079
Don't be ridiculous.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.759
- I say they're gay.
- Etienne knows.

25:24.839 --> 25:26.559
- Go on.
- There's no chicks.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.400
Here neither.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.119
There are pics of chicks
in all the cells.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.480
- Your wife in the raw.
- Asshole.

25:35.119 --> 25:36.839
Cut it out. Carry on.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.160
I don't do gay.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.400
What's this about?

25:40.400 --> 25:42.920
Two losers hoping for a brighter future.

25:43.000 --> 25:43.920
Get that?

25:44.759 --> 25:46.720
Who cares if they're gay?

25:47.640 --> 25:50.839
"I don't know who Godot is
or if he exists."

25:52.039 --> 25:53.559
Beckett said that.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.279
Working with these guys,

25:56.839 --> 25:58.880
I feel I know more than him.

25:59.599 --> 26:00.759
Understand?

26:00.839 --> 26:03.319
I've played it. I thought I knew it.

26:03.400 --> 26:07.319
With them, it's full of meaning.
It's enlightening.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.440
How many shows?

26:09.079 --> 26:10.480
One, in theory.

26:10.559 --> 26:11.640
That's all?

26:12.279 --> 26:14.279
It's a reintegration thing?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.759
No, it's theatre.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.400
You say you're directing.

26:19.480 --> 26:20.720
I am directing.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.039
So it lets you reintegrate
in the profession too.

26:26.279 --> 26:27.319
That's mean.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.359
I'm kidding.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.279
Sorry.

26:30.799 --> 26:31.720
What did they do?

26:32.359 --> 26:33.359
No idea.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.960
- We don't mention it.
- No one said?

26:36.839 --> 26:38.319
I don't want to know.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.400
When you go out,
there'll be a police escort?

26:43.480 --> 26:45.880
- Just two warders.
- That's all?

26:46.759 --> 26:48.200
What if they escape?

26:48.279 --> 26:51.720
They're at the end of their stretches.
It'd be crazy.

26:51.799 --> 26:54.640
It's good for them. It's a trust thing.

26:56.119 --> 27:00.000
Ten to a cell
and you're the safety valve.

27:00.079 --> 27:01.599
What do you mean?

27:01.680 --> 27:03.720
Long stretches get single cells.

27:03.799 --> 27:06.799
If bringing them culture
makes me a safety valve,

27:06.880 --> 27:08.079
I'm proud to be one.

27:09.039 --> 27:11.519
- Why get mad?
- It's ambitious.

27:11.599 --> 27:12.799
And useful too.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.759
Good. Forgive me.

27:16.559 --> 27:17.599
How do they act?

27:18.799 --> 27:20.039
They sound false.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.319
But there's a truth to them.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.400
You can perform right
but be totally false.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.440
The opposite of true
isn't always false.

27:30.519 --> 27:33.839
You can also be right
by being true.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.960
I prefer true by being false
rather than right...

27:37.559 --> 27:38.680
They will be.

27:38.759 --> 27:40.559
- What?
- Right.

27:40.640 --> 27:43.039
And true as well. You'll see.
Bread?

27:43.720 --> 27:44.680
Please.

27:45.720 --> 27:47.440
- When is it?
- June.

27:47.519 --> 27:49.920
Shit, during my exams.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.480
Exams aren't at night.

27:52.079 --> 27:53.559
I revise at night.

27:54.559 --> 27:56.279
Want to do a mountain hike?

27:56.920 --> 27:57.880
With me?

27:58.519 --> 28:01.440
The lake route.
It'll clear your mind.

28:01.519 --> 28:02.680
Sure, but when?

28:02.759 --> 28:04.359
A weekend, maybe.

28:04.440 --> 28:05.920
I work at weekends.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.519
Always working.
We do nothing together.

28:09.119 --> 28:10.680
I'm funding my uni.

28:10.759 --> 28:12.519
You could have come

28:12.599 --> 28:14.200
to see Mom with me.

28:16.119 --> 28:17.960
Don't you revise at night?

28:18.559 --> 28:19.599
Ok, drop it.

28:26.759 --> 28:29.279
2 MONTHS

28:32.160 --> 28:34.200
No, four times "qua".

28:35.039 --> 28:37.319
Quaquaquaqua with white beard...

28:37.400 --> 28:38.319
Yo, bitches!

28:39.599 --> 28:42.000
What's up, motherfucker?

28:42.519 --> 28:44.000
Learning to read?

28:45.200 --> 28:46.680
Fucking jokers.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.079
Forget them.

28:48.759 --> 28:51.759
...quaqua with white beard,
quaqua outside...

28:52.559 --> 28:55.880
outside time... Fuck.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.799
Of the divine... Go on.

28:58.759 --> 29:00.039
From the heights...

29:00.119 --> 29:02.839
Motherfucker! I can't understand it!

29:02.920 --> 29:04.000
Fuck this.

29:04.079 --> 29:05.720
C'mon...
From the heights...

29:06.279 --> 29:07.839
Jordan, come back!

29:09.480 --> 29:12.759
...who from the heights of divine...

29:15.000 --> 29:18.319
of divine athambia divine aphasia

29:18.400 --> 29:21.480
What the fuck's "aphasia"?
Isn't it a country?

29:22.079 --> 29:24.319
It's theatre of the absurd.
Carry on.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.319
- Jordan has his lawyer too?
- No, his mom's sick.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.720
- So?
- It bugs him.

29:32.799 --> 29:34.599
You'd come if yours was sick?

29:34.680 --> 29:36.880
- Sure.
- It's your job, not ours.

29:36.960 --> 29:38.480
Brooding in his cell

29:38.559 --> 29:40.160
won't cure his mom!

29:40.839 --> 29:41.759
Shit!

29:43.759 --> 29:44.799
Thanks, warder.

29:45.279 --> 29:47.319
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

29:48.160 --> 29:49.480
Ok, man?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.680
- Why are you here?
- To work.

29:51.759 --> 29:53.400
- Move over.
- Ok.

29:53.759 --> 29:55.079
Work on what?

29:55.160 --> 29:56.839
I'm here for Estragon.

29:57.920 --> 29:58.960
The play.

29:59.039 --> 30:00.720
Remember Kamel Beckett?

30:02.839 --> 30:04.599
I don't understand.

30:05.279 --> 30:09.160
I worked it out with Nabil.
It's all settled.

30:09.240 --> 30:12.160
- What do you mean?
- I'm helping out.

30:16.599 --> 30:19.720
- Where?
- The far end. Box A.

30:23.799 --> 30:24.720
Nabil!

30:29.640 --> 30:30.960
What is this shit?

30:31.599 --> 30:33.200
I quit, I'd rather work.

30:33.559 --> 30:35.920
- Why?
- I just don't want to.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.559
You were loving it!

30:37.640 --> 30:39.319
Don't piss me off, ok.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.039
Kamel agreed.

30:41.119 --> 30:43.279
Screw Kamel. It's two months' work!

30:44.359 --> 30:45.359
Nabil!

30:48.200 --> 30:49.720
You'd rather peel onions?

30:49.799 --> 30:50.799
Right.

30:51.400 --> 30:54.039
Work on your part, Nabil.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.400
Louder.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.119
Where do we come in?

30:58.200 --> 31:00.000
Speak clearly. Come on.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.279
Speak clearly!

31:03.720 --> 31:05.799
- Again.
- Where do we come in?

31:05.880 --> 31:07.640
Breathe, dammit!

31:07.720 --> 31:09.480
Can't you breathe?

31:09.559 --> 31:11.559
Show him how, Moussa.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.640
From your belly, like this.

31:17.119 --> 31:19.920
Alright. Take it from the top.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.119
I can't hear you!
It's marked "anxious".

31:23.200 --> 31:24.839
Can't you read?

31:24.920 --> 31:26.119
Watch it, Etienne.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.559
- Start again!
- Watch your tone.

31:29.079 --> 31:31.559
I'm the director here.
You want to act?

31:32.680 --> 31:34.000
You do as I say.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.640
Start again.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.119
And we?

31:45.920 --> 31:47.000
Go on.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.000
And we?

31:48.599 --> 31:49.680
Pardon?

31:49.759 --> 31:51.200
- And we?
- I don't understand.

31:51.279 --> 31:53.440
- Where do we come in?
- Come in?

31:53.519 --> 31:54.839
- Take your time.
- Come in?

31:55.640 --> 31:57.799
- On our knees.
- As bad as that?

31:57.880 --> 32:00.359
Your Worship has his prerogatives?

32:00.440 --> 32:01.880
We've no rights?

32:01.960 --> 32:04.680
That's it, good! From the top again.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.279
Take it from the top.

32:08.839 --> 32:10.400
- And we?
- Pardon?

32:10.480 --> 32:11.880
Louder, Kamel.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.480
I said, and we?

32:13.559 --> 32:16.440
- Why do you want to act?
- I love Beckett.

32:16.519 --> 32:17.759
The real reason?

32:17.839 --> 32:20.920
- Asked the others?
- They've been here all along.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.079
Ok...

32:22.960 --> 32:25.039
You call that the real reason?

32:26.039 --> 32:28.920
- Will you get an exit permit?
- I'm a model prisoner.

32:33.759 --> 32:36.039
Listen, we're a company.

32:36.119 --> 32:37.599
And I'm in charge.

32:41.119 --> 32:42.599
We see this through?

32:42.680 --> 32:44.480
- Deal?
- You'll take me on?

32:52.200 --> 32:54.160
Can you do a monkey?

32:59.279 --> 33:00.599
Afraid of ridicule?

33:21.680 --> 33:22.799
The lines suck,

33:22.880 --> 33:26.160
the rope sucks, the play sucks...
So I replace you?

33:26.240 --> 33:29.279
I won't speak. I'll do it in mime.

33:29.359 --> 33:32.440
No way. Your monologue
is the most powerful moment!

33:33.079 --> 33:36.799
Lucky opens his mouth
for the first time in years.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.599
The words tumble out.

33:38.680 --> 33:41.680
- It's too long!
- The others have more lines.

33:41.759 --> 33:45.000
Screw them.
I try to learn but it won't register.

33:45.079 --> 33:46.160
Stop smoking.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.079
Screw you, ball-buster!

33:48.160 --> 33:50.559
Come back. I'm here for you.

33:50.640 --> 33:51.759
Piss off!

33:51.839 --> 33:53.519
Shit, sorry, Etienne.

33:53.599 --> 33:55.319
What's going on here?

33:55.400 --> 33:57.400
- We're rehearsing.
- You're bleeding?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.119
I tripped up.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.400
- Let's go, Fortineau.
- We have 10 minutes left.

34:02.480 --> 34:03.640
10 minutes.

34:03.720 --> 34:04.799
Thank you.

34:05.839 --> 34:06.799
Sit down.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.599
- Row.
- It's no use.

34:10.679 --> 34:13.280
Take this and row.
It'll calm you.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.440
Row!

34:15.000 --> 34:17.360
Go on, row. Faster.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.199
Row!

34:19.800 --> 34:22.119
Faster. Come on, speed it up.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.159
Your lines:
Given the existence...

34:25.239 --> 34:27.960
in the public works
of Puncher and Wattmann

34:28.039 --> 34:31.199
of a personal God
quaquaquaqua with white beard...

34:31.280 --> 34:32.960
Clearer!
From the heights...

34:33.039 --> 34:35.400
From the heights of divine apathia
divine athambia

34:35.480 --> 34:36.519
Speak clearly!

34:37.079 --> 34:38.039
Come on!

34:38.920 --> 34:40.360
Loves us dearly...

34:40.960 --> 34:42.280
Loves us dearly...

34:43.440 --> 34:44.719
Loves us dearly...

34:44.800 --> 34:46.519
for reasons unknown...

34:46.599 --> 34:48.039
for reasons unknown...

34:52.280 --> 34:54.880
but time will tell
plunged in torment

34:54.960 --> 34:57.280
fire and flames will blast hell

34:57.360 --> 34:58.599
to heaven so blue!

35:01.880 --> 35:03.039
Good, Jordan.

35:04.159 --> 35:05.079
You wanker.

35:12.079 --> 35:13.480
Take it easy!

35:13.559 --> 35:16.159
There's no time to waste!

35:16.239 --> 35:17.920
Chicago gangsters!

35:18.599 --> 35:20.840
It's kind of old style.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.440
Like in that series.

35:22.519 --> 35:24.840
- The Joker!
- Like this?

35:24.920 --> 35:25.880
Guys.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.119
- Wait for it...
- Food?

35:31.960 --> 35:33.000
You're wild.

35:33.079 --> 35:34.440
A real crook!

35:34.519 --> 35:36.760
Forget the rope.
Bring hash instead.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.400
- The rope's settled.
- I won't use it.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.920
- Etienne!
- Any other props?

35:43.000 --> 35:44.559
I have my character.

35:44.639 --> 35:45.719
Excellent!

35:45.800 --> 35:47.280
- Sébastien...
- Stop drooling.

35:49.559 --> 35:52.599
The pipe works for Pozzo.
Keep the hat.

35:52.679 --> 35:54.519
You look wonderful.

35:55.840 --> 35:56.760
Gentlemen,

35:57.480 --> 36:00.440
I am happy to have met you.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.360
Yes, yes, sincerely happy.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.280
Closer!

36:06.800 --> 36:07.719
Stop!

36:09.440 --> 36:11.880
Yes,
the road seems long

36:11.960 --> 36:13.719
when one journeys alone

36:13.800 --> 36:15.800
for... yes, six hours,

36:15.880 --> 36:19.920
that's right, six hours on end,
and never a soul in sight.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.800
Excellent, Patrick!

36:22.760 --> 36:24.840
They're good, huh? Like that.

36:26.239 --> 36:27.599
Put the bag down.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.559
Take the coat.

36:29.639 --> 36:31.760
Stand.
Whip in your teeth.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.559
In the teeth. Coat.

36:33.639 --> 36:34.880
Take the coat.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.880
Put the coat on. And you,

36:37.519 --> 36:39.199
don't forget,

36:39.280 --> 36:41.719
he's the local landowner.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.800
Look impressed.
Give me an impressed look.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.280
Very good. You too.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.800
That's impressed?

36:49.880 --> 36:51.559
Your eyes don't show it.

36:52.119 --> 36:53.039
Be impressed.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.440
Think of the judge.

36:55.519 --> 36:57.440
- Not impressed?
- I like him.

36:59.559 --> 37:00.480
He likes him.

37:01.079 --> 37:03.960
Boiko here, doesn't he impress you?

37:04.039 --> 37:05.480
The cleaning lady?

37:08.519 --> 37:09.480
What?

37:10.159 --> 37:11.840
Say it in French.

37:11.920 --> 37:13.840
Talking to me, bitch?

37:13.920 --> 37:15.079
Bitch? Me?

37:16.239 --> 37:18.599
Ok, that's enough! Calm down.

37:18.679 --> 37:20.000
- Good looker.
- Stop!

37:22.280 --> 37:23.719
No one impresses you.

37:24.280 --> 37:26.639
Truth is, someone does, my mom.

37:27.199 --> 37:28.360
She impresses me.

37:30.360 --> 37:31.440
Laugh and you die.

37:32.039 --> 37:32.960
Got that?

37:34.800 --> 37:35.880
Calm down.

37:35.960 --> 37:38.159
Enough, Kamel. Let's act.

37:38.239 --> 37:39.800
Start all over again.

37:40.719 --> 37:42.079
From the top.

37:42.159 --> 37:44.559
I don't remember what I said,

37:44.639 --> 37:48.400
but you may be sure
there wasn't a word of truth in it.

37:48.480 --> 37:51.360
Do I look like a man
that can be made to suffer?

37:53.400 --> 37:55.920
- Well?
- You act really well, honey.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.320
He said I was brilliant.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.119
Brilliant, he said.

38:01.119 --> 38:02.360
I adore you.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.320
Nothing you can do about it.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.440
One is what one is.

38:05.519 --> 38:07.480
- No use wriggling.
- Nothing changes.

38:07.559 --> 38:11.360
I have a rope around my neck
and Pozzo pulls me.

38:11.440 --> 38:14.000
- Like a mutt?
- No, don't piss me off.

38:14.079 --> 38:16.559
The character has a rope
round his neck.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.039
Nothing to be done.

38:20.119 --> 38:21.639
Like to finish it?

38:21.719 --> 38:23.360
I give him the carrot.

38:23.440 --> 38:27.119
That's when you hear
Pozzo's hideous cry ring out.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.400
Estragon freezes,

38:29.480 --> 38:31.000
turns back for the carrot...

38:35.559 --> 38:36.559
He pockets it.

38:36.639 --> 38:39.320
Vladimir waits. Estragon joins him.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.440
Come on, Patrick.

38:41.599 --> 38:43.800
How's Martine? You fucked her?

38:44.880 --> 38:47.719
Pozzo turns up with Lucky.
Here you go.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.880
Lucky enters first.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.599
Jordan, hurry up.

38:51.679 --> 38:53.079
Lucky and Pozzo...

38:53.159 --> 38:55.280
I'm an Indian, not a cowboy?

38:55.800 --> 38:58.119
This is all I had, sorry.
Just take it.

38:58.679 --> 39:01.000
Faster! Faster!

39:01.079 --> 39:02.000
Why that voice?

39:02.760 --> 39:05.039
It's the cowboy's voice.

39:05.119 --> 39:06.599
- So?
- A cowboy.

39:07.159 --> 39:08.079
Basket!

39:08.599 --> 39:10.360
Stop it! Stop it!

39:10.440 --> 39:11.360
What is this?

39:12.920 --> 39:14.599
It's a rehearsal.

39:14.679 --> 39:16.639
Eat! Think, pig!

39:19.760 --> 39:22.079
Mr Carboni, this isn't a theatre.

39:22.159 --> 39:25.440
It's a prison,
with delinquents and criminals.

39:25.519 --> 39:29.079
Imagine the work it requires.
You never watch the news?

39:29.159 --> 39:33.480
I fight to bring culture here,
negotiating every inch of the way.

39:33.559 --> 39:35.960
- No one else believes in it.
- I do.

39:36.039 --> 39:40.719
You're making my life hell!
The chief warder's on my back!

39:40.800 --> 39:42.679
I have a new actor.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.000
Let's talk about him.

39:45.079 --> 39:47.079
Know why Mr Jouhari quit?

39:47.159 --> 39:49.880
- He lost interest.
- No, I'll tell you.

39:49.960 --> 39:53.639
Mr Ramdane made him back out
and give him the part.

39:53.719 --> 39:55.920
You don't refuse a boss here.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.280
Kamel may seem nice enough,

39:58.360 --> 40:00.159
but he's a hardened criminal!

40:01.360 --> 40:03.559
The visiting room was his idea?

40:03.639 --> 40:05.199
There, I knew it.

40:06.519 --> 40:08.960
- Replace him.
- The guy who's read it?

40:09.039 --> 40:12.760
A guy like him
has to be up to something.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.039
He's a manipulator, a problem.

40:15.119 --> 40:18.000
My problem is finding actors
and he's good.

40:18.079 --> 40:20.199
He may not get an exit permit!

40:20.280 --> 40:22.280
You'll plead his case.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.840
Who says I will?

40:23.920 --> 40:26.039
I'm asking you to, for the show.

40:32.119 --> 40:33.559
You never give up.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.039
I warned you anyhow.

40:43.079 --> 40:46.159
The next problem, you come to me.

40:46.239 --> 40:47.159
I have one.

40:48.159 --> 40:49.559
I need to rehearse every day.

40:50.920 --> 40:52.639
- Is that all?
- No.

40:53.239 --> 40:54.679
In the auditorium.

40:55.239 --> 40:56.159
Very good.

41:06.239 --> 41:07.440
Put the coat on.

41:08.159 --> 41:09.119
Up!

41:12.760 --> 41:13.679
Help!

41:15.199 --> 41:17.000
- Kamel.
- I don't know.

41:17.079 --> 41:20.000
That's not what I said.
Start again and focus!

41:20.079 --> 41:21.360
You're not focused.

41:21.440 --> 41:22.480
Help!

41:22.559 --> 41:24.159
No, it's Moussa now.

41:24.239 --> 41:27.840
Later, later... No, that's not it.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.039
No, you say it twice.

41:30.400 --> 41:33.679
It's Stéphane.
Is everything going ok there?

41:34.760 --> 41:38.159
If it's too tough, tell me.
I don't want a crap show.

41:38.239 --> 41:40.119
I'd rather cancel in that case.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.320
Call me.

41:44.639 --> 41:46.880
4 MONTHS

41:46.960 --> 41:49.199
You skipped two pages, Moussa.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.559
You don't know it.

41:50.639 --> 41:52.880
- We do.
- You only think you do.

41:52.960 --> 41:55.199
You trip over words,
skip lines,

41:55.280 --> 41:57.599
miss marks.
Jordan, you forgot it all.

41:57.679 --> 41:59.639
We can't understand his prompts.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.559
You shouldn't need prompts!

42:02.639 --> 42:04.119
I keep saying it.

42:04.199 --> 42:07.440
- It has to be fluid and rapid.
- What's up?

42:07.519 --> 42:10.360
I've carried you for months.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.960
I won't be on stage.

42:12.039 --> 42:14.880
Work together.
You've nothing else to do.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.800
- Saying that cos we're cons?
- What?

42:16.880 --> 42:17.920
It's insulting.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.159
Insulting?

42:19.239 --> 42:21.360
Insulting? For me, you're actors.

42:22.119 --> 42:24.039
- I defend you.
- That's easy.

42:25.119 --> 42:27.199
- What's up?
- Manage alone!

42:27.280 --> 42:28.199
Etienne...

42:37.159 --> 42:40.199
5 of you benefit from this project.

42:40.800 --> 42:43.840
5 out of 500.
Know how lucky you are?

42:44.880 --> 42:48.039
Ever thought
how hard Mr Carboni is working?

42:48.920 --> 42:50.960
What we had to do to set it up?

42:51.039 --> 42:55.119
You'll even be paid to act.
That's a first. Etienne demanded it.

42:57.079 --> 42:58.280
I'm sick of this.

42:58.360 --> 42:59.840
Go back to your cells.

42:59.920 --> 43:02.480
- Ma'am...
- The warders will love it.

43:02.559 --> 43:04.400
- We don't want to stop.
- No?

43:05.000 --> 43:05.920
Where are you?

43:06.639 --> 43:08.840
Where were you when he left?

43:08.920 --> 43:09.920
We were here.

43:10.679 --> 43:13.559
- Come on, show me.
- Here.

43:13.639 --> 43:15.639
Pity! Pity!

43:16.239 --> 43:17.920
What is it?

43:18.000 --> 43:19.559
Were you asleep?

43:19.639 --> 43:20.559
I must have been.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.440
That bastard Pozzo again.

43:22.519 --> 43:24.400
Let's let him sleep.

43:24.480 --> 43:26.559
He wants to know what happened.

43:26.639 --> 43:28.400
Leave him in peace!

43:29.559 --> 43:32.440
Etienne, it's Ariane.
What do we do?

43:33.679 --> 43:36.280
Are you quitting or carrying on?

43:38.480 --> 43:40.519
Know what Jordan said?

43:40.599 --> 43:42.760
You're changing his life.
There.

43:44.159 --> 43:47.960
So, please call me back.
I don't know what to do.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.079
Good night.

44:08.079 --> 44:10.480
But, behind this veil

44:10.559 --> 44:12.480
of gentleness and peace,

44:13.519 --> 44:14.480
night is charging

44:16.679 --> 44:19.559
and will burst upon us.

44:19.639 --> 44:20.880
Like that!

44:23.840 --> 44:24.800
Just when

44:25.559 --> 44:27.840
we least expect it.

44:27.920 --> 44:29.599
That's how it is

44:30.920 --> 44:33.159
on this bitch of an earth!

44:36.280 --> 44:38.000
So long as one knows.

44:38.079 --> 44:39.920
One can bide one's time.

44:40.639 --> 44:42.280
One knows what to expect.

44:42.360 --> 44:44.199
No further need to worry.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.440
Simply wait.

44:48.840 --> 44:49.920
Go, the Godots!

44:50.480 --> 44:51.519
So, gentlemen,

44:52.639 --> 44:54.880
how did you find me?

44:58.599 --> 44:59.519
Good?

45:01.280 --> 45:02.440
Fair?

45:03.239 --> 45:04.480
Very good!

45:06.000 --> 45:07.199
Very good!

45:07.280 --> 45:08.920
Very, very good.

45:09.559 --> 45:10.559
Poor?

45:11.480 --> 45:12.880
Positively bad?

45:13.400 --> 45:16.159
Oh very good, very, very good.

45:16.239 --> 45:17.519
Clam up, Killian!

45:17.599 --> 45:21.440
I have such need of encouragement!

45:21.519 --> 45:24.079
I heard you, Ahmad, you trannie!

45:24.159 --> 45:27.159
I weakened a little towards the end.

45:27.239 --> 45:29.679
You didn't notice?

45:29.760 --> 45:31.280
Just a teeny bit.

45:31.840 --> 45:34.000
Fucking bastards!

45:34.079 --> 45:35.000
Go, Godots!

45:41.920 --> 45:44.000
Up! Pig! Raise him up!

45:44.079 --> 45:47.159
- He's doing it on purpose!
- He always does.

45:47.239 --> 45:49.719
Up, scum! Help me!

45:49.800 --> 45:52.079
Let go of him, ok!

45:53.800 --> 45:55.800
Hey, what's up with you?

45:58.639 --> 46:00.599
Go on, piss them off.

46:00.679 --> 46:02.000
Cut it out now.

46:02.599 --> 46:04.480
- Pig!
- Perhaps he's dead.

46:04.559 --> 46:06.199
Maybe he's dead, man!

46:06.280 --> 46:07.599
Raise him up.

46:07.679 --> 46:09.199
Leave us be, jerk.

46:09.920 --> 46:11.480
Don't push us.

46:11.559 --> 46:13.079
You like blowing kids!

46:13.159 --> 46:15.000
- What?
- You blow kids!

46:16.480 --> 46:17.559
Fucking bitch!

46:33.880 --> 46:35.079
Mr Carboni?

46:35.679 --> 46:37.199
Jordan's illiterate,

46:37.280 --> 46:39.559
but he learned a 3-page monologue.

46:39.639 --> 46:41.159
It's like Everest.

46:41.239 --> 46:43.440
Three pages impossible to perform.

46:43.519 --> 46:46.119
It took him months. Now, he's ready.

46:46.639 --> 46:48.800
He's immature, impulsive,

46:48.880 --> 46:52.920
but he's turning into a real actor.
He'll surprise you.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.039
Ok, but this isn't the Conservatoire.

46:56.639 --> 47:00.119
I'd rather he surprised me
with his conduct.

47:00.199 --> 47:02.679
Nothing better than the stage.

47:03.280 --> 47:04.719
That's hard to believe.

47:05.639 --> 47:08.320
When I mentioned Everest,

47:08.400 --> 47:10.159
they're all climbing it.

47:10.239 --> 47:12.440
Me too, roped up with them.

47:13.119 --> 47:15.800
It's dumb to stop
with the summit in sight.

47:15.880 --> 47:19.119
And Patrick Le Garrec?
How's his climb going?

47:23.760 --> 47:27.360
6 MONTHS

47:40.800 --> 47:42.199
My head's spinning.

47:49.719 --> 47:51.559
The wind has a taste.

47:51.639 --> 47:53.719
The wind has a taste, sir.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.719
Ok, gentlemen, let's go.

47:57.039 --> 47:58.119
See all this?

48:57.679 --> 48:59.079
You're freaking out.

48:59.159 --> 49:02.719
I freak out too when I act,
but it's ok, the audience will laugh.

49:02.800 --> 49:05.039
You'll love it. It's a drug.

49:05.119 --> 49:06.400
So let yourselves go.

49:06.840 --> 49:10.000
If you forget a line, don't panic.

49:10.079 --> 49:12.039
Stay focused

49:12.119 --> 49:14.000
and, above all,

49:14.079 --> 49:15.519
the diaphragm!

49:16.719 --> 49:17.840
The diaphragm.

49:19.280 --> 49:20.760
I think that's all.

49:21.519 --> 49:22.800
One other thing...

49:25.000 --> 49:27.159
I was happy to work with you.

49:27.719 --> 49:29.000
You're great guys.

49:29.079 --> 49:31.119
So shit, shit, shit.

49:31.199 --> 49:32.400
Shit?

49:32.480 --> 49:35.000
Shit means luck in French theatre.

49:36.119 --> 49:37.159
Motherfucker!

49:37.239 --> 49:39.400
Asshole! Fucking bastard!

49:39.480 --> 49:41.480
- How's that?
- "Shit" is better.

49:42.639 --> 49:44.719
- Motherfucker!
- Son of a bitch!

49:44.800 --> 49:46.079
Shit.

49:46.679 --> 49:47.599
Shit!

49:50.039 --> 49:51.000
Asshole!

50:05.719 --> 50:08.360
Nina, it's me, where are you?

50:08.440 --> 50:10.800
It's about to start.
Aren't you coming?

50:10.880 --> 50:11.800
Call me.

50:12.360 --> 50:13.920
- An actor's missing.
- Who?

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Kamel.

50:23.559 --> 50:25.599
Etienne, what's going on?

50:29.599 --> 50:30.679
Is he there?

50:30.760 --> 50:31.800
Kamel, what's up?

50:34.280 --> 50:36.039
Are you injured or what?

50:36.719 --> 50:38.079
Where's Kamel?

50:38.159 --> 50:39.559
We have to go on.

50:39.639 --> 50:41.400
Get lost! Leave me alone.

50:41.480 --> 50:44.079
- What's up?
- I'm not doing it!

50:44.159 --> 50:46.480
You can't do this.
My brother's here!

50:47.079 --> 50:48.599
Let me handle it.

50:48.679 --> 50:50.840
Go to the stage. I'll handle it.

50:51.880 --> 50:53.039
Go to the stage.

51:16.559 --> 51:19.280
His bitch of a mom didn't bring him.

51:21.599 --> 51:23.360
Four years since I saw him.

51:28.280 --> 51:29.800
I wanted him to see me.

51:31.679 --> 51:32.679
It sucks...

51:34.920 --> 51:36.079
How old is he?

51:36.599 --> 51:39.000
He's 7.
Haven't I shown you Nono?

51:40.239 --> 51:42.039
He was 4 in this photo.

51:43.360 --> 51:45.320
Handsome, isn't he?

51:45.400 --> 51:46.360
Very.

51:47.079 --> 51:48.119
That's why...

51:49.079 --> 51:51.320
I did it so he'd see me act.

51:51.840 --> 51:55.519
You act for yourself,
not for someone else.

51:56.400 --> 51:59.159
- You can't miss this.
- Screw it.

51:59.760 --> 52:01.159
Act. Do something.

52:04.039 --> 52:08.440
You'd let me read your part for you?
Want to tell your son that?

52:12.159 --> 52:13.119
Kamel...

52:14.599 --> 52:16.800
Good evening and welcome.

52:16.880 --> 52:21.159
The actor due to play Estragon
has a slight problem.

52:21.800 --> 52:25.000
He will be replaced by the director

52:25.079 --> 52:26.679
who will read the part.

52:26.760 --> 52:30.000
Please give them
the warmest possible welcome.

52:30.079 --> 52:32.360
Remember to turn off your phones.

52:32.440 --> 52:35.400
Have a good evening
and let the show begin.

52:41.280 --> 52:42.800
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

52:42.880 --> 52:45.440
Shit. See you later.

52:50.360 --> 52:51.280
It's ok.

52:51.800 --> 52:52.719
I'll do it.

53:01.480 --> 53:02.400
Your shoe.

53:03.239 --> 53:04.360
Your shoe.

53:07.280 --> 53:08.199
Shoe.

53:08.719 --> 53:10.039
Nothing to be done.

53:13.639 --> 53:15.199
I'm starting to think that.

53:16.719 --> 53:19.800
All my life, I've tried to ignore it,
saying,

53:19.880 --> 53:20.800
"Vladimir,

53:21.199 --> 53:24.119
be reasonable,
you haven't tried everything."

53:24.199 --> 53:25.960
And I resumed the struggle.

53:27.079 --> 53:29.039
So there you are again.

53:29.119 --> 53:31.119
- Am I?
- Speak up!

53:31.199 --> 53:32.840
Can't hear you.

53:34.039 --> 53:37.159
I'm glad you're back.
I thought you were gone forever.

53:37.239 --> 53:38.679
Me too.

53:38.760 --> 53:40.679
We'll have to celebrate this.

53:43.599 --> 53:46.360
- Get up, let me embrace you.
- Not now.

53:47.239 --> 53:48.440
C'mon, Kamel.

53:49.920 --> 53:52.079
- Where did you sleep?
- In a ditch!

53:53.800 --> 53:55.639
- Shit...
- That's good.

53:57.679 --> 54:00.039
- What are you doing?
- Removing my boot.

54:00.119 --> 54:01.519
Don't you do that?

54:01.599 --> 54:03.360
- It hurts?
- Hurts!

54:04.119 --> 54:06.679
He asks if it hurts!
Shit...

54:06.760 --> 54:07.679
Only you suffer.

54:08.800 --> 54:10.039
I don't count.

54:11.159 --> 54:13.000
I'd like to hear you

54:13.079 --> 54:14.639
if you had what I have.

54:22.239 --> 54:23.320
It hurts?

54:24.280 --> 54:25.719
He asks if it hurts!

54:30.280 --> 54:31.920
Charming spot.

54:32.800 --> 54:33.920
Inspiring prospects.

54:35.239 --> 54:37.079
You're on the other side!

54:37.159 --> 54:39.960
- I don't know my lines.
- You do!

54:40.039 --> 54:41.840
I yell, but then what?

54:41.920 --> 54:45.280
Yell and it'll come back.
Your lines are waiting.

54:45.360 --> 54:46.400
It's magical.

54:46.480 --> 54:47.440
Hurry!

54:48.239 --> 54:49.760
Nothing changes.

54:49.840 --> 54:50.760
It's no use!

54:51.599 --> 54:52.559
Like to finish it?

54:56.880 --> 54:58.039
Faster!

54:58.960 --> 55:00.039
Back!

55:02.440 --> 55:04.039
Let go and calm down.

55:04.119 --> 55:05.039
Careful!

55:05.679 --> 55:11.199
- He's wicked with strangers!
- It's him.

55:11.280 --> 55:12.519
- Who?
- You know.

55:12.599 --> 55:13.920
- Godot?
- Yes.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.519
I present myself:

55:15.599 --> 55:16.760
Pozzo.

55:16.840 --> 55:18.360
- No!
- He said Godot!

55:19.079 --> 55:20.920
You're not Mr Godot?

55:21.000 --> 55:23.039
Pozzo.
Don't you know the name?

55:23.719 --> 55:26.280
Does that name mean nothing to you?

55:26.840 --> 55:28.840
Pozzo... Let me see...

55:32.719 --> 55:34.000
Are you nuts?

55:40.400 --> 55:42.000
Think, hog!

55:47.599 --> 55:49.960
Stop! Step forward!

55:51.760 --> 55:52.679
Wait!

55:54.559 --> 55:55.480
Think!

56:05.079 --> 56:07.280
On the other hand with regard to...

56:11.159 --> 56:12.400
Lucky!

56:12.480 --> 56:14.000
Lucky, here!

56:14.079 --> 56:15.119
Get back on stage.

56:15.199 --> 56:16.119
Lucky!

56:16.719 --> 56:17.639
Back!

56:18.000 --> 56:18.920
Get back out there.

56:20.480 --> 56:21.519
No one's laughing.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
Pull, pull!

56:25.880 --> 56:26.800
He's too strong!

56:28.400 --> 56:29.320
Help me!

56:31.400 --> 56:32.559
Think!

56:33.599 --> 56:34.840
Think, hog!

56:39.400 --> 56:41.039
Help me!

56:41.119 --> 56:42.800
Yes, we'll help you.

56:44.880 --> 56:46.480
Lucky, come here!

56:46.559 --> 56:47.519
Up!

56:49.079 --> 56:50.880
Come on, think...

56:50.960 --> 56:53.800
Given the existence
in the works of Puncher and Wattmann...

56:59.360 --> 57:01.000
Given, given, given,

57:01.079 --> 57:03.079
given, given, given,

57:03.159 --> 57:04.360
the existence

57:06.519 --> 57:09.599
in the works of Puncher and Wattmann...

57:09.679 --> 57:13.559
of a personal God quaquaquaqua
with white beard outside time

57:15.960 --> 57:19.559
who from the heights of divine apathia
loves us dearly

57:19.639 --> 57:22.079
time will tell and suffers
like the divine Miranda

57:22.159 --> 57:24.480
who for reasons unknown

57:24.559 --> 57:27.599
are plunged in flames
to fire the firmament...

57:31.360 --> 57:35.440
and blast hell to heaven so blue
still and so calm

57:35.519 --> 57:38.559
with intermittent but good calm

57:38.639 --> 57:41.960
as a result of the labours
left unfinished

57:42.039 --> 57:45.360
by the Acacacacademy
of Anthropopopometry

57:45.440 --> 57:47.800
of Testew and Cunnard!

57:53.079 --> 57:55.119
It is established as follows...

57:55.760 --> 57:58.320
We'll hang ourselves tomorrow.
Unless Godot comes.

57:58.400 --> 58:00.719
- If he comes.
- We'll be saved.

58:00.800 --> 58:02.800
- Pull on your trousers.
- What?

58:03.159 --> 58:06.199
- Pull on your trousers.
- Pull them off?

58:06.280 --> 58:09.320
Pull on your trousers!

58:10.159 --> 58:11.159
True.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.920
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

59:38.280 --> 59:40.480
That was huge, man.

59:40.559 --> 59:42.840
A bigger buzz than a hold-up.

59:42.920 --> 59:44.159
Glad to hear it.

59:45.039 --> 59:46.320
Well done, guys.

59:46.400 --> 59:47.639
Etienne, thanks.

59:49.199 --> 59:52.480
It was awesome, totally wild.
Thank you, Etienne.

59:53.079 --> 59:56.320
See this jerk turn up like Darth Vador!

59:56.400 --> 59:57.760
You're too much.

59:57.840 --> 59:59.599
- You're nuts.
- I'm Godot!

1:00:01.280 --> 1:00:03.199
Beckett never wrote that.

1:00:03.280 --> 1:00:05.960
Give us a break.
He's dead, we're alive.

1:00:06.039 --> 1:00:08.800
Bravo, that was
a really great performance.

1:00:09.599 --> 1:00:11.280
Thanks, Stéphane.

1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:12.840
Fantastic.

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:18.199
I don't know you. Well done.

1:00:18.280 --> 1:00:20.079
Thank you, Stéphane.

1:00:20.159 --> 1:00:21.599
I should thank you.

1:00:22.119 --> 1:00:23.719
Three cheers for Etienne!

1:00:32.239 --> 1:00:33.639
They're soft toys.

1:00:34.639 --> 1:00:35.800
Nothing inside.

1:00:37.559 --> 1:00:38.960
That's not dangerous.

1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:41.760
Into socks now?

1:00:42.559 --> 1:00:44.639
When do we get our gifts?

1:00:45.559 --> 1:00:47.800
Warder, answer me.

1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:48.800
No idea.

1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:50.880
Colleague!

1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:52.920
What's this scent?

1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:54.039
Let's go.

1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:01.559
- Can I keep my wife's flowers?
- No, perishable.

1:01:01.639 --> 1:01:03.760
That's not nice for Martine.

1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:04.880
Warder...

1:01:06.440 --> 1:01:07.719
6C. Next.

1:01:13.679 --> 1:01:15.719
It was important for me.

1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:18.000
It went well.
Why did you miss it?

1:01:18.559 --> 1:01:20.039
I was revising.

1:01:20.119 --> 1:01:21.880
You could have tried!

1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:24.280
Dad, know what a Master's is?

1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:26.719
You still went to see your mom!

1:01:27.239 --> 1:01:30.599
It was the role of her life.
You didn't even go.

1:01:30.679 --> 1:01:33.320
Screw Claudel.
I'm in the nitty-gritty.

1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:34.760
Give me a break.

1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:36.599
You didn't do it for them.

1:01:36.679 --> 1:01:37.760
So?

1:01:38.599 --> 1:01:39.920
Can't I exist?

1:01:41.559 --> 1:01:42.760
No one wants me!

1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:47.679
Of course not, Dad,
you're so full of rage

1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:49.000
and rancour...

1:01:49.079 --> 1:01:50.760
You sound like your mom.

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.119
She's right.

1:01:52.199 --> 1:01:53.840
You're self-centred.

1:01:55.159 --> 1:01:56.400
Self-centred?

1:01:57.679 --> 1:02:00.079
You didn't even ask how my exams went.

1:02:05.599 --> 1:02:07.719
"We witness live

1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:11.440
the apt and truthful
prisoners' catharsis..."

1:02:11.519 --> 1:02:12.719
Listen to this.

1:02:13.039 --> 1:02:16.280
"The audience is struck:
great theatre!"

1:02:16.360 --> 1:02:17.599
What do we do now?

1:02:18.079 --> 1:02:21.119
Etienne, we chipped in
to get you a present.

1:02:21.719 --> 1:02:24.000
Get lost, I'm the one giving it!

1:02:24.559 --> 1:02:25.760
Calm down.

1:02:27.159 --> 1:02:29.280
That's kind. What is it?

1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:31.079
Open it.

1:02:34.519 --> 1:02:37.000
- We have other sizes.
- No, it's good.

1:02:37.079 --> 1:02:39.079
- Happy?
- Yes, I am.

1:02:39.159 --> 1:02:40.079
Thanks, Godots.

1:02:41.119 --> 1:02:42.280
Mr Carboni.

1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:43.400
You're wanted.

1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:47.039
Come in.

1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:49.159
Etienne...

1:02:52.079 --> 1:02:53.960
- What's up?
- Busy in September?

1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:57.000
- Busy?
- Are you free?

1:02:57.639 --> 1:02:59.559
- Why?
- Godot in Villefranche.

1:02:59.639 --> 1:03:01.280
Lorenzi loved it.

1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:04.599
He wants to schedule it.
Next year's out,

1:03:04.679 --> 1:03:06.000
so it's for September.

1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:08.960
The judge agrees.

1:03:09.039 --> 1:03:11.119
That's not all. Machado called.

1:03:11.199 --> 1:03:12.440
He wants it too.

1:03:12.519 --> 1:03:13.639
In Annecy?

1:03:13.719 --> 1:03:15.719
And Grenoble's interested.

1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:18.559
- A major stage.
- You'll be doing a tour.

1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:21.320
Bravo, man.

1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:24.280
Thank you.

1:03:26.920 --> 1:03:30.039
9 MONTHS

1:03:30.760 --> 1:03:32.119
- Not bad.
- Think so?

1:03:32.199 --> 1:03:33.239
A bit effeminate.

1:03:33.320 --> 1:03:35.079
- He slobbers.
- Inevitable.

1:03:35.159 --> 1:03:37.119
- He foams.
- Perhaps he's a halfwit.

1:03:37.199 --> 1:03:38.360
A cretin.

1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:40.320
He's blowing bubbles!

1:03:41.239 --> 1:03:42.719
That's disgusting!

1:03:50.559 --> 1:03:51.639
Bubbles...

1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:53.679
Leave him in peace!

1:03:56.199 --> 1:03:57.960
Can't you see he wants to rest?

1:04:02.519 --> 1:04:03.760
Leave him in peace.

1:04:04.599 --> 1:04:06.079
Alex! Come back!

1:04:06.159 --> 1:04:07.199
Not on stage!

1:04:08.639 --> 1:04:10.519
Can't you see he wants to rest?

1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:15.760
Go on, act!

1:04:21.199 --> 1:04:22.559
Carry on!

1:04:23.400 --> 1:04:25.599
No one was with it tonight.

1:04:26.079 --> 1:04:27.960
Jordan, you weren't there.

1:04:28.039 --> 1:04:29.880
Alex, I couldn't hear you.

1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:33.119
Patrick, I told you,
stop staring at Martine.

1:04:34.559 --> 1:04:35.880
And the laughter...

1:04:35.960 --> 1:04:37.360
It was pathetic.

1:04:37.719 --> 1:04:39.480
A pro keeps going.

1:04:40.079 --> 1:04:41.159
We're not pros.

1:04:41.239 --> 1:04:43.079
You're paid, so you're pros.

1:04:43.159 --> 1:04:44.559
They laughed.

1:04:44.639 --> 1:04:46.559
At cons clowning around.

1:04:47.159 --> 1:04:49.880
I don't do reintegration,
I do theatre.

1:04:50.760 --> 1:04:52.800
The audience must forget who you are.

1:04:53.440 --> 1:04:55.159
Think we can forget?

1:04:55.239 --> 1:04:57.679
We can't even buy cigarettes here.

1:04:57.760 --> 1:04:59.119
I'll split anytime.

1:04:59.199 --> 1:05:01.360
- So split.
- Calm down.

1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:04.079
Respect us.
You don't get searched after.

1:05:04.159 --> 1:05:05.719
They take everything.

1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:08.480
All the presents and my wife's flowers.

1:05:08.559 --> 1:05:10.400
We play the game,

1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:12.599
but get treated like shit.

1:05:12.679 --> 1:05:15.760
- The judge didn't even come.
- Good job!

1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:17.079
The way you performed.

1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:19.719
Annecy has to be better.

1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:23.199
A lot better
or we all look like shit.

1:06:19.639 --> 1:06:23.920
It's the rule. I can't ask
the chief warder to suspend searches.

1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:26.800
- It's humiliating.
- I agree.

1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:28.400
I'll talk to him.

1:06:30.679 --> 1:06:33.440
I don't get it...
Are you the warden or not?

1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:38.280
Warders are different.
They have their habits, their unions.

1:06:38.960 --> 1:06:41.960
They can lock the guys in if they want.

1:06:42.599 --> 1:06:44.159
It's not an easy job.

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.199
So what use are you?

1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:49.199
I change things.

1:06:50.599 --> 1:06:51.920
Like right now.

1:06:56.519 --> 1:07:00.679
And was prison warden
a childhood dream?

1:07:02.119 --> 1:07:05.679
I was a lawyer.
I got sick of the routine.

1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:08.519
Court-appointed work, divorces...

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:10.880
Mine included.

1:07:11.719 --> 1:07:13.440
So you found a gloomier job.

1:07:14.159 --> 1:07:16.199
No, I could have done tax law.

1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:20.639
But I feel better here.

1:07:21.719 --> 1:07:22.960
You're surprised?

1:07:24.760 --> 1:07:26.840
They were good tonight.

1:07:26.920 --> 1:07:28.440
Right, Hugo?

1:07:28.519 --> 1:07:30.639
- What did you think?
- They were cool.

1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:33.079
I don't agree.

1:07:33.159 --> 1:07:35.199
You really are a pain.

1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:37.280
I bet Stéphane said that.

1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:39.400
A good actor too, he said.

1:07:40.280 --> 1:07:41.800
He's got a nerve.

1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:43.800
You did Godot together?

1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:46.320
Long ago.

1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:51.519
After the Conservatoire,
he wanted his own theatre.

1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:54.000
I just wanted to act.

1:07:56.079 --> 1:07:58.199
It's 3 years since I was on stage.

1:08:02.639 --> 1:08:03.760
The ball!

1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:22.439
What a save! Fucking awesome!

1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:31.439
Let's go.

1:08:31.520 --> 1:08:33.000
No time left.

1:08:35.399 --> 1:08:36.640
Patrick, come on!

1:08:37.199 --> 1:08:38.560
Let's go, guys.

1:08:43.279 --> 1:08:45.439
Guys, let's get moving.

1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:49.720
- How much?
- Already paid.

1:08:51.479 --> 1:08:52.560
Thanks.

1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:53.560
Goodbye.

1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:09.920
Just chocolates. You can try one.

1:09:13.359 --> 1:09:15.119
You like fondling toys?

1:09:15.199 --> 1:09:16.319
I'm working.

1:09:16.399 --> 1:09:18.600
- You're not on stage.
- I just said

1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:20.800
you're into soft toys, like.

1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:22.600
- What the hell?
- Calm down.

1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:24.640
- A full search!
- Murderer!

1:09:31.039 --> 1:09:32.960
You calmed him, Russky!

1:09:33.039 --> 1:09:35.840
Poor little soft toy.
You fucked it up.

1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:46.640
What have I done with my spray?

1:09:50.079 --> 1:09:51.880
I can't find my pulverizer!

1:10:22.119 --> 1:10:23.279
Pooh!

1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:25.279
I'd do as well myself.

1:10:51.359 --> 1:10:53.319
What does he do? You hear me?

1:10:53.399 --> 1:10:54.840
- Yes, sir.
- Well?

1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:56.199
He does nothing, sir.

1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:30.880
Was I sleeping,
while the others suffered?

1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:32.560
Am I sleeping now?

1:11:33.399 --> 1:11:36.760
Tomorrow, when I wake,
what shall I say of today?

1:11:37.279 --> 1:11:41.159
That with Estragon, my friend,
until the fall of night,

1:11:41.239 --> 1:11:42.359
I waited for Godot?

1:11:47.079 --> 1:11:49.680
No need to stay here.
They won't fly away.

1:11:50.159 --> 1:11:52.880
- You don't know them.
- I do.

1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:54.760
They're actors here.

1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:56.319
Want their records?

1:11:58.439 --> 1:12:01.520
Drug trafficking, homicide,
armed robbery...

1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:02.680
Not interested.

1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:05.800
Good job we do the dirty work
while you shine.

1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:07.560
My men got attacked again.

1:12:07.640 --> 1:12:09.119
So take it easy.

1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:24.199
BE BAC SOON

1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:26.720
Miss,

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:28.359
don't stop just yet.

1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:29.800
Thank you.

1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:31.439
Come with me, please.

1:12:33.359 --> 1:12:34.800
Look at that body!

1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:37.399
- Shit, she's so hot.
- Alex...

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.680
Alex, let's split.

1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:41.359
- Are you nuts?
- Let's split.

1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:43.600
- Who does the play?
- No one.

1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:45.039
Forget it.

1:12:45.119 --> 1:12:47.680
- And the audience.
- What do they care?

1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:49.880
They have an easy life.

1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:53.319
- Etienne?
- C'mon, he doesn't sleep in a cell.

1:12:53.399 --> 1:12:55.039
You can't do that to Etienne.

1:12:55.119 --> 1:12:57.279
We're performing tonight, ok.

1:12:57.359 --> 1:12:59.359
Etienne would say it too!

1:12:59.439 --> 1:13:01.079
"Make the most of it!"

1:13:01.159 --> 1:13:02.319
Fucking idiot.

1:13:02.399 --> 1:13:03.760
- Kamel!
- What?

1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:05.640
Jordan wants to split!

1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:07.199
Now we'll see.

1:13:07.279 --> 1:13:08.920
We'll see who splits.

1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000
You fucking snitch.

1:13:11.079 --> 1:13:12.920
- He wants to split.
- Shithead.

1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.359
What's the idea?

1:13:14.439 --> 1:13:17.279
It's the last show.
Don't you want to be free?

1:13:17.359 --> 1:13:20.119
Think it over. We have to split.

1:13:20.199 --> 1:13:21.680
- You won't act?
- I said...

1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:24.039
- Stop stuttering!
- I'm not.

1:13:24.119 --> 1:13:25.079
Let's split!

1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:27.439
That shut you up.

1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:29.600
No, I'm not going back.

1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:31.039
Get off me!

1:13:31.119 --> 1:13:33.039
Act tonight or I'll waste you.

1:13:33.640 --> 1:13:36.199
Shit, I'm not going back there!

1:13:36.279 --> 1:13:38.319
Shut up. Give me the trimmer.

1:13:38.399 --> 1:13:40.479
No, let go!

1:13:40.560 --> 1:13:42.079
What the fuck is this?

1:13:43.439 --> 1:13:45.840
Raise your hand, motherfucker.

1:13:45.920 --> 1:13:47.640
Fucking ball-buster!

1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:48.920
Fucking snitch!

1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:50.199
Cut it out!

1:13:50.279 --> 1:13:52.560
Fucking let go of me!

1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:53.800
Beautiful, huh?

1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:56.560
Bastards.
Kamel, you're busting my balls.

1:13:57.159 --> 1:13:59.159
I leave a lock?

1:13:59.239 --> 1:14:00.159
Let go!

1:14:01.479 --> 1:14:03.760
- Nice parting!
- Fuck you all!

1:14:04.479 --> 1:14:07.600
Come here!
No, you're right, get lost.

1:14:07.680 --> 1:14:08.880
Where're you going?

1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:11.039
Jordan!

1:14:11.119 --> 1:14:13.439
You're crazy!
You're on in 20 minutes...

1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.079
Jordan took us there.

1:14:17.399 --> 1:14:18.920
Go and get ready!

1:14:19.399 --> 1:14:20.319
What's that?

1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:22.079
What is this?

1:14:22.159 --> 1:14:23.760
Are you totally dumb?

1:14:24.439 --> 1:14:26.520
- Chill, bro.
- What? No way!

1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:28.720
It could've been a lot worse!

1:14:29.279 --> 1:14:30.560
You're on in 20 minutes!

1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:33.399
I don't fucking believe this.

1:14:33.479 --> 1:14:34.560
Where's Alex?

1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:35.840
Ok, guys?

1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:40.199
Irresponsible!

1:14:40.279 --> 1:14:43.079
Let us not waste our time
in idle discourse!

1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:45.319
Let us act while we can.

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:47.560
We aren't needed every day.

1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:50.479
Not personally needed anyhow.

1:14:51.039 --> 1:14:53.560
Others could do as well,
if not better.

1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:56.920
The call we just heard

1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:00.119
is addressed to the whole of mankind.

1:15:00.199 --> 1:15:02.800
But right now, in this place,

1:15:02.880 --> 1:15:05.800
mankind is us,
whether we like it or not.

1:15:32.239 --> 1:15:33.359
My son!

1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:36.199
Take a bow with us?

1:15:44.439 --> 1:15:45.920
You're the best!

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:52.199
Take a bow with us.

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:24.760
Cut it out. What's that bottle?

1:16:24.840 --> 1:16:26.439
The last show party.

1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:28.199
I'll report you, smart ass!

1:16:28.840 --> 1:16:30.439
The last show party?

1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:33.000
No way. Give me the bottle.

1:16:33.079 --> 1:16:34.640
You won't get this one!

1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:39.399
Puccino, with us!

1:16:44.279 --> 1:16:46.720
Even stars get searched!

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:49.159
- What was that?
- The search.

1:16:49.239 --> 1:16:50.920
No search tonight!

1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:52.800
Fortineau, you'll go first.

1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:54.960
No way!

1:16:55.039 --> 1:16:56.840
Search us now, ok!

1:16:56.920 --> 1:16:58.479
Wanna see my body?

1:16:59.079 --> 1:17:00.600
Check my pockets!

1:17:02.119 --> 1:17:03.560
Come and search me!

1:17:07.520 --> 1:17:09.000
What's the problem?

1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:37.479
Search my ball sack!

1:18:34.039 --> 1:18:34.960
It's Stéphane.

1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:37.880
Can't you ever pick up?

1:18:37.960 --> 1:18:41.000
The Odéon in Paris called.

1:18:41.079 --> 1:18:43.600
The Odéon! Call me, ok.

1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:45.159
Get in touch!

1:18:46.479 --> 1:18:49.520
All your actors
are in the disciplinary block.

1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:51.600
They'll be out in a month.

1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:54.880
They'll never get permits again.

1:18:54.960 --> 1:18:57.680
They stripped,
they didn't kill anyone.

1:18:58.439 --> 1:18:59.960
Some did...

1:19:00.039 --> 1:19:04.279
It's the Odéon...
The Odéon National Theatre!

1:19:05.840 --> 1:19:09.199
I realize that,
but there's no more I can do.

1:19:09.279 --> 1:19:10.840
Talk to the judge.

1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:15.159
She'll never sign an exit permit.
Can't you understand that?

1:19:15.239 --> 1:19:16.920
I'll talk to her.

1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:18.479
She won't see you.

1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:19.920
Refuse the Odéon?

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:21.279
Such a huge break?

1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:23.520
A break for you above all.

1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:25.000
What are you implying?

1:19:25.079 --> 1:19:27.960
They've no idea what the Odéon is.

1:19:28.039 --> 1:19:30.800
When they see it, they'll be stunned!

1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:32.399
The answer's no.

1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.199
How else can I put it?

1:19:35.399 --> 1:19:36.359
Give them these.

1:19:37.079 --> 1:19:38.960
There's one for you too.

1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:43.680
You must have been a shit lawyer.
Look at me.

1:19:44.439 --> 1:19:46.720
Don't ever count on me again.

1:20:05.960 --> 1:20:07.079
Are you ok?

1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:09.880
I'm rehearsing.

1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:26.199
I understand.

1:20:26.279 --> 1:20:29.279
After being treated like stars,

1:20:29.359 --> 1:20:31.399
they return to their cells.

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:33.439
It's not easy for them.

1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:35.359
So it's best to stop.

1:20:35.439 --> 1:20:38.039
It's a pity
you never saw them on stage....

1:20:38.119 --> 1:20:39.920
Madam Warden...

1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:42.560
You plead well,

1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:45.920
but there are things
I cannot let by.

1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:50.920
I'll vouch for them.
I'll go with them to Paris myself.

1:20:52.239 --> 1:20:54.000
I've followed this far,

1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:56.680
but we've done enough.

1:20:56.760 --> 1:20:59.079
I'm thinking of their victims.

1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:01.760
Quite frankly,

1:21:01.840 --> 1:21:04.800
aren't there more urgent matters?

1:21:06.760 --> 1:21:10.840
Have you ever thought
about running a cultural centre?

1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:12.520
I'm trying to.

1:21:17.960 --> 1:21:19.439
I can't hear anything.

1:21:21.479 --> 1:21:22.560
Me neither.

1:21:22.640 --> 1:21:24.680
- You scared me!
- I thought it was him.

1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:26.159
- Who?
- Godot!

1:21:27.439 --> 1:21:30.479
- The wind in the reeds.
- Like shouts.

1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:33.640
- Why would he shout?
- At his horse.

1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:35.439
There's nothing more.

1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:37.840
Just the words of the play.

1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:39.439
Just the words.

1:21:40.199 --> 1:21:42.439
Just the words and people's looks.

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:46.439
I wear a bum's outfit,
but I feel good in it.

1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.560
Frankly, I feel like I'm flying.

1:21:50.399 --> 1:21:52.840
I'm like an angel.

1:21:52.920 --> 1:21:56.439
I feel really light,
despite weighing 110 kilos.

1:21:57.159 --> 1:22:00.479
Seeing all these people who basically

1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:03.800
feel afraid of me
or have ideas about me...

1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:05.720
Seeing them applaud us...

1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:07.960
For once, I'm not screwing up.

1:22:09.279 --> 1:22:12.800
Usually, the slightest step I take,

1:22:13.479 --> 1:22:15.760
I trigger a landmine.

1:22:16.359 --> 1:22:17.880
There you go.

1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:20.880
That's Godot.

1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:23.640
He repeats stuff

1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:27.079
and we have to repeat
what he repeats.

1:22:27.159 --> 1:22:28.159
And that...

1:22:29.119 --> 1:22:30.520
The energy's so good.

1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:33.039
We're not used to it.

1:22:34.079 --> 1:22:35.600
I'm really proud.

1:22:36.079 --> 1:22:39.800
It was a real high point.
My kid was there...

1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:43.199
We're all proud. You're proud too?

1:22:43.279 --> 1:22:44.199
Of course.

1:22:45.399 --> 1:22:46.800
You're right to be.

1:22:50.079 --> 1:22:52.800
1 YEAR

1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:55.760
Are you ready? Here we go!

1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:56.800
Right...

1:22:58.720 --> 1:22:59.640
Absurd.

1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:02.000
Look at this.

1:23:02.079 --> 1:23:03.520
Awesome!

1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:04.840
It's totally wild.

1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:08.840
- It's the Champions League.
- The final.

1:23:10.279 --> 1:23:12.119
Is all that real gold?

1:23:12.199 --> 1:23:14.079
Gold leaf, more like.

1:23:14.159 --> 1:23:16.479
- The chandeliers...
- Shit.

1:23:22.279 --> 1:23:24.279
Act like in Croix-Rousse

1:23:24.359 --> 1:23:25.880
or Annecy. It's easy.

1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:29.680
Make the most of this

1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:31.960
as it's the last one, ok.

1:23:32.039 --> 1:23:33.479
Free yourselves.

1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:35.920
Surprise us. It's yours.

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.560
No one can take it,
even at the search.

1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:40.560
Isn't the judge coming?

1:23:40.640 --> 1:23:42.039
No idea. Forget her.

1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:44.000
What matters is...

1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:48.760
Excuse me,
we leave for Fleury prison at 11pm.

1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:50.279
They're stressed!

1:23:50.359 --> 1:23:52.840
Come back at the end.
Get out!

1:23:54.399 --> 1:23:57.000
C'mon, you're the one stressing us.

1:23:57.479 --> 1:23:58.520
Ok, warriors.

1:23:58.600 --> 1:23:59.520
Let's go!

1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:47.720
Etienne, the judge is here.

1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:49.520
Where is she?

1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:53.039
In the stalls, just beneath me.

1:24:54.159 --> 1:24:55.319
Ok, I see her.

1:24:56.920 --> 1:24:58.319
I'll let them know.

1:25:00.079 --> 1:25:01.359
Shit, as they say.

1:25:07.199 --> 1:25:09.640
Actors on stage, please.

1:25:09.720 --> 1:25:10.680
Moussa?

1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:14.319
10 minutes to curtain up.

1:25:16.479 --> 1:25:17.479
Kamel!

1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:29.439
Alex!

1:25:31.520 --> 1:25:33.560
- Seen the actors?
- Try the stage.

1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:35.880
- I was just there.
- The other stairs...

1:25:41.159 --> 1:25:43.800
- Seen my actors?
- Tried the wings?

1:25:43.880 --> 1:25:44.840
Ok, thanks.

1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:49.279
Olivier, can you do another call?

1:25:50.279 --> 1:25:54.159
Actors on stage, please.
10 minutes to curtain up.

1:25:56.079 --> 1:25:57.560
I don't believe it.

1:26:02.479 --> 1:26:03.560
Boiko!

1:26:06.199 --> 1:26:07.680
Where are the others?

1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:10.399
Checked the blue room?

1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:19.479
Actors on stage, please.

1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:22.279
- Everything ok?
- Fine.

1:26:22.359 --> 1:26:23.520
See you later.

1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:25.000
5 minutes to curtain up.

1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.960
- Have you seen the actors?
- They went that way.

1:26:29.039 --> 1:26:29.960
Thank you.

1:26:45.880 --> 1:26:47.840
This is so beautiful.

1:26:48.279 --> 1:26:49.319
They'd follow

1:26:49.399 --> 1:26:51.199
your father anywhere.

1:26:51.279 --> 1:26:53.199
He must be freaking out too.

1:26:53.279 --> 1:26:55.720
It was hell at home when he acted.

1:27:00.159 --> 1:27:01.119
Look!

1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:03.640
The Justice Minister.

1:27:40.239 --> 1:27:43.840
Next train in 1 minute,
the following one in 5 minutes.

1:28:10.159 --> 1:28:11.199
No reply.

1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:17.760
I'll check.

1:28:26.039 --> 1:28:26.960
Good evening.

1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:29.840
Excuse me.

1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:35.079
I'm the show's director.

1:28:35.159 --> 1:28:37.600
Something unusual has happened.

1:28:38.159 --> 1:28:40.760
I've lost my actors.

1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:44.319
They were in their dressing rooms,

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.279
but now they've vanished.

1:28:47.359 --> 1:28:51.039
I know. I can't believe it either.
It's not a joke.

1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:53.680
I don't see what I can do

1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:55.560
apart from wait for them.

1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:57.319
But they won't be back,

1:28:57.399 --> 1:28:59.399
so I won't suggest that.

1:28:59.479 --> 1:29:01.840
It would be like waiting for Godot.

1:29:03.159 --> 1:29:04.560
Some know the play.

1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:08.119
It's better to laugh,

1:29:08.199 --> 1:29:09.640
but it's a nightmare.

1:29:10.399 --> 1:29:12.279
I just feel like vanishing.

1:29:12.920 --> 1:29:13.840
Sorry.

1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:24.840
Wait a second before you go.

1:29:27.720 --> 1:29:30.640
Thank you.
Maybe you don't realize,

1:29:31.359 --> 1:29:33.680
but this is totally crazy.

1:29:34.279 --> 1:29:35.720
It's pure Beckett.

1:29:35.800 --> 1:29:38.800
It's as if he wrote this, understand?

1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:41.560
Know what he said
about writing for the stage?

1:29:41.640 --> 1:29:44.640
It is a "wonderful,
liberating diversion".

1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:45.880
I think

1:29:46.479 --> 1:29:48.119
we're seeing that.

1:29:48.199 --> 1:29:49.520
Right, Samuel?

1:29:53.439 --> 1:29:56.079
So tell me. What happens now?

1:30:01.560 --> 1:30:02.560
Nothing.

1:30:03.119 --> 1:30:06.359
Nothing's happening.
It really is a Beckett play.

1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:14.640
What a beautiful theatre.

1:30:15.880 --> 1:30:18.640
I dreamed of performing here.

1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:20.520
I'm an actor by trade.

1:30:21.560 --> 1:30:23.199
An actor in Lyon.

1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:25.279
Down in Lyon,

1:30:25.359 --> 1:30:26.880
the Odéon's just a dream.

1:30:28.520 --> 1:30:30.319
But anything can happen.

1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:34.560
Too bad
I'm here to send you home.

1:30:38.119 --> 1:30:40.680
You know, from the beginning,

1:30:40.760 --> 1:30:42.720
nothing went as planned.

1:30:42.800 --> 1:30:44.279
Dim the house lights.

1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:46.000
Ever been in a prison?

1:30:46.079 --> 1:30:47.880
As a visitor, I mean.

1:30:50.239 --> 1:30:51.680
You line up.

1:30:52.159 --> 1:30:53.840
You hand over your ID.

1:30:53.920 --> 1:30:56.720
Someone behind smoked glass

1:30:56.800 --> 1:30:59.279
opens the door to reception.

1:30:59.359 --> 1:31:00.279
You get a pass.

1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:03.880
You leave your phone
and pass a security gate.

1:31:03.960 --> 1:31:05.439
Like at an airport.

1:31:07.079 --> 1:31:08.600
It's a real journey.

1:31:08.680 --> 1:31:10.159
Checks, more gates...

1:31:10.239 --> 1:31:11.840
There's a long walkway

1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:13.800
and you hear the prisoners.

1:31:13.880 --> 1:31:17.319
"Son of a bitch!" "Asshole!"
"Motherfucker!"

1:31:18.159 --> 1:31:19.439
"Fuck your granny!"

1:31:20.119 --> 1:31:21.560
At the end of a corridor,

1:31:21.640 --> 1:31:22.920
the cells.

1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:25.039
Three guys were waiting.

1:31:25.119 --> 1:31:28.000
None of us really knew
why we were there.

1:31:29.279 --> 1:31:31.199
And I thought of Godot .

1:31:31.760 --> 1:31:35.399
I thought they'd understand.
They know waiting.

1:31:35.479 --> 1:31:36.720
It's all they do.

1:31:36.800 --> 1:31:39.119
Waiting for meals, exercise,

1:31:39.199 --> 1:31:41.079
mail, visits, night,

1:31:44.279 --> 1:31:45.199
sleep...

1:31:50.479 --> 1:31:52.520
And, above all, to get out.

1:32:11.880 --> 1:32:13.920
Tonight, they'd had enough.

1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:18.760
They didn't get Beckett right away.

1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:20.840
Except for one.

1:32:22.279 --> 1:32:23.359
Moussa.

1:32:23.439 --> 1:32:25.399
He got it from the word go.

1:32:25.479 --> 1:32:27.399
He'd walked from Ouagadougou.

1:32:27.479 --> 1:32:31.880
He'd done Morocco, Gibraltar and Spain
on foot.

1:32:31.960 --> 1:32:35.760
When he said,
"Maybe we'll sleep well fed tonight,"

1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:37.640
he truly meant it.

1:32:37.720 --> 1:32:39.079
Kamel, the boss...

1:32:39.840 --> 1:32:42.279
He wanted to impress his son.

1:32:42.359 --> 1:32:44.680
Jordan could barely read,

1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:46.520
but he was funny.

1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:47.760
Patrick...

1:32:48.560 --> 1:32:50.479
Always performing for his wife.

1:32:51.399 --> 1:32:54.600
Alex, the child,
two metres, 100 kilos.

1:32:54.680 --> 1:32:57.399
A go-fast driver, without a licence.

1:32:58.199 --> 1:33:00.600
Innocence itself.
You'd have loved them.

1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:02.560
They slowly got into it.

1:33:02.640 --> 1:33:05.319
They tackled this peak, Godot .

1:33:05.399 --> 1:33:07.399
And it was a tough climb.

1:33:09.079 --> 1:33:11.439
It was totally different.

1:33:11.520 --> 1:33:13.600
Something actors have lost.

1:33:13.680 --> 1:33:16.680
They speak from a place,
I don't know where.

1:33:16.760 --> 1:33:18.000
They're elsewhere.

1:33:18.760 --> 1:33:20.079
Especially tonight.

1:33:21.359 --> 1:33:24.479
They don't have our hang-ups.
Beckett isn't sacred.

1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:26.760
They wanted to see Godot.

1:33:26.840 --> 1:33:31.159
At the premiere, he appeared on stage.

1:33:31.239 --> 1:33:34.119
At the end, like a vision, a ghost.

1:33:34.199 --> 1:33:36.760
He looked like a killer.
He came from Siberia.

1:33:37.239 --> 1:33:38.880
Boiko, my assistant.

1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:45.880
It wasn't planned, but I kept it.
I had to, for them.

1:33:46.439 --> 1:33:48.640
I think Beckett would have too.

1:33:49.039 --> 1:33:50.279
Right, Samuel?

1:33:50.359 --> 1:33:53.279
I put my cowboys and Indians
on a chair.

1:33:53.359 --> 1:33:55.720
Estragon, Vladimir, Pozzo, Lucky...

1:33:56.199 --> 1:33:57.279
This big.

1:33:57.600 --> 1:34:02.560
We rehearsed in the visiting room.
The look on the warder's face!

1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:04.680
Six guys playing with toy soldiers.

1:34:05.159 --> 1:34:07.319
She'd never seen the like.

1:34:07.399 --> 1:34:08.760
I nearly got fired.

1:34:10.159 --> 1:34:12.479
I pissed everyone off.

1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:14.880
Prisoners, warders, the judge...

1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:18.960
And the warden.
Sorry, Madam Warden.

1:34:20.359 --> 1:34:22.279
You made it all possible.

1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:27.640
True, I am a pain.

1:34:28.159 --> 1:34:32.439
It's true but, Madam Warden,
to set up something like this,

1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:34.600
you have to be a first-class pain.

1:34:39.039 --> 1:34:40.000
Thank you.

1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:49.079
But at this place, at this moment,

1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:51.279
all mankind is us,

1:34:52.039 --> 1:34:53.039
like it or not.

1:34:54.439 --> 1:34:56.800
Let's make the most of it while we can.

1:34:57.479 --> 1:35:01.079
Let us represent the foul brood
to which fate consigned us!

1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:03.279
But that is not the question.

1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:05.359
What are we doing here,

1:35:06.279 --> 1:35:07.920
that is the question.

1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:11.840
And we happen to know the answer.

1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:14.159
In this immense confusion,

1:35:14.239 --> 1:35:16.039
one thing alone is clear.

1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:18.600
We are waiting for Godot to come.

1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:22.319
Soon, all will vanish

1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:24.520
and we'll be alone again,

1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:26.680
in the midst of nothingness.

1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:34.880
Safe travels, guys.

1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:38.119
I'll miss you.
Thank you. Goodbye.

1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:01.960
Good evening.

1:36:02.039 --> 1:36:03.920
- Are you the director?
- Yes.

1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:09.199
- May I go to the dressing room?
- Lead the way.

1:36:12.359 --> 1:36:13.399
You were amazing.

1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:16.439
I couldn't do anything.

1:36:19.399 --> 1:36:20.720
Go back out there.

1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:25.079
Go on.

1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:26.960
They're waiting.

1:36:33.399 --> 1:36:34.960
- Hello?
- It's Kamel.

1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:39.840
We're really sorry,
but we couldn't take anymore.

1:36:41.199 --> 1:36:45.159
I wanted to thank you, man,
for everything you did.

1:36:45.239 --> 1:36:46.520
We won't forget.

1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:52.880
- You're not in the shit?
- Don't worry. Listen.

1:36:56.439 --> 1:36:57.720
What's that?

1:36:57.800 --> 1:36:58.960
That's for you?

1:36:59.399 --> 1:37:00.760
No, for you.

1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:35.560
On May 12, 1986, prisoners escaped

1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:39.279
before the final performance
of Waiting for Godot in Gothenburg.

1:37:39.359 --> 1:37:41.840
Jan Jönson, the director,
went on stage to explain

1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:44.960
and related this theatrical adventure.

1:37:45.039 --> 1:37:48.920
He turned the story into a show
that he performs all over Europe.

1:38:07.359 --> 1:38:10.159
On hearing about the escape,
Samuel Beckett said,

1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:15.119
"This is the most beautiful thing
that could happen to my play."

1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:22.319
THE BIG HIT
