WEBVTT

00:04.050 --> 00:08.759
Captain's log, stardate 45571.2.
We are going into orbit

00:08.888 --> 00:12.303
around an unexplored M-Class moon
of Mab-Bu VI.

00:12.433 --> 00:17.011
Though it is reported uninhabited,
we have picked up a distress call.

00:22.776 --> 00:25.017
The electromagnetic whirlwinds

00:25.153 --> 00:28.438
make it hard to locate
the source of the signal.

00:28.573 --> 00:31.942
- Any indications of life?
- Scanners read negative.

00:32.076 --> 00:34.199
But there is interference.

00:34.328 --> 00:36.451
Have you ever heard anything similar?

00:36.580 --> 00:39.249
I believe so.
At Starfleet Academy.

00:39.374 --> 00:41.912
- The Academy?
- I will verify it.

00:42.377 --> 00:46.540
As I thought. It is
a Starfleet subspace distress signal,

00:46.673 --> 00:49.164
standard to Daedalus-class starships.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.838
They haven't been in service
for... what?

00:51.969 --> 00:53.214
172 years, sir.

00:53.346 --> 00:56.181
Any records of missing ships
in this vicinity?

00:56.307 --> 00:59.308
The USS Essex,
under Capt Bryce Shumar,

00:59.435 --> 01:02.638
disappeared in this sector
over two centuries ago.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.313
Daedalus-class.

01:04.438 --> 01:08.140
I have accessed the
transponder signature of the Essex.

01:08.276 --> 01:11.230
It is identical
to the signal from the moon.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.272
We arrived a little late!

01:14.240 --> 01:15.983
Mute it, Mr Data.

01:16.117 --> 01:20.613
With the storms, it isn't worth
the risk to check on a ghost ship.

01:20.746 --> 01:25.207
Advise Starfleet we have solved
the mystery of the Essex.

01:25.334 --> 01:27.410
I'm not sure we have.

01:29.838 --> 01:32.044
Someone's down there.

01:33.675 --> 01:35.335
Alive.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.499 --> 02:11.784
Space, the final frontier.

02:13.337 --> 02:17.464
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

02:17.591 --> 02:21.802
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

02:22.929 --> 02:26.380
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

02:27.600 --> 02:31.549
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

03:30.033 --> 03:32.072
First Officer's log, supplemental.

03:32.202 --> 03:37.622
The interference is too dangerous
for anyone to transport down.

03:37.748 --> 03:40.749
So we have taken a shuttle
to investigate.

03:44.838 --> 03:48.918
- Shields are holding.
- Wind shear is incredible.

03:49.051 --> 03:51.588
Data, keep an eye on the stabilisers.

03:53.013 --> 03:57.057
If it's like this on the ground,
how can people survive?

03:57.183 --> 03:59.935
- Maybe they live underground.
- Where?

04:00.061 --> 04:02.931
I still can't locate
the source of the signal.

04:03.064 --> 04:05.637
It's bouncing around
more than we are.

04:05.774 --> 04:08.728
Thrusters have failed.
We are losing power.

04:08.861 --> 04:09.940
Enterprise!

04:10.070 --> 04:12.691
- Go ahead.
- We've lost our thrusters.

04:12.823 --> 04:14.899
Attempting to use boosters.

04:15.033 --> 04:17.654
Their impulse generators
have shut down.

04:17.786 --> 04:19.113
Can you hear me?

04:19.245 --> 04:22.531
Enterprise to shuttle.
Please respond.

04:22.665 --> 04:24.574
Hold on! We're going down.

04:24.709 --> 04:29.121
- Initiating emergency landing.
- Maintain the approach attitude.

04:33.217 --> 04:36.336
I'm taking her in. Brace for impact!

04:55.821 --> 04:58.442
- The shuttle has crashed.
- Position?

04:58.573 --> 05:00.233
I have the trace signature,

05:00.367 --> 05:03.403
but the interference
is distorting its position.

05:03.536 --> 05:05.944
- Can you locate them?
- I think I can.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.872
I followed their entry.

05:07.999 --> 05:11.249
We can calculate coordinates
from the angle of descent.

05:28.143 --> 05:31.346
- Your arm.
- Pretty sure that's broken.

05:31.479 --> 05:33.021
Enterprise!

05:33.147 --> 05:37.524
It is unlikely we will be able
to establish communication.

05:37.651 --> 05:40.225
We'll stay in the area
until they find us.

05:40.362 --> 05:44.490
Take an inventory of the shuttle.
See if there's anything usable.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.406
The ground cover is nonporous rock.

05:47.536 --> 05:51.319
It's even less likely
anyone's living here.

05:51.456 --> 05:56.580
There are no instruments left
that have not been damaged.

05:56.711 --> 05:58.668
What is that?

05:59.505 --> 06:02.790
It's not like any storm front
I've ever seen.

06:02.925 --> 06:06.507
High levels of EM bursts
across the spectrum.

06:06.637 --> 06:08.925
No life signs other than our own.

06:09.056 --> 06:12.389
There is someone alive here.
I'm certain.

06:12.517 --> 06:16.431
I hope they can find us.
There's no way we'll find them.

06:16.563 --> 06:21.308
They're coming.
They're coming with the storm.

06:24.028 --> 06:27.397
We can't get a lock on them
because of the EM bursts.

06:27.531 --> 06:30.982
There's no way we can beam them out
in these conditions.

06:31.118 --> 06:35.614
Those conditions stop a shuttle
landing safely. Any suggestions?

06:35.747 --> 06:37.241
Give us a minute.

06:38.166 --> 06:40.917
Let me beam down
with a pattern enhancer.

06:41.044 --> 06:45.836
You could rematerialise in
a million pieces in that whirlwind.

06:45.965 --> 06:48.041
I can boost the confinement beam.

06:48.175 --> 06:51.129
One person might be able to make it.

06:52.262 --> 06:56.129
O'Brien wants to beam down
with a pattern enhancer.

06:56.266 --> 07:01.473
His chances of making it down there
safely are no better than 50/50.

07:01.604 --> 07:06.065
A major storm front is moving in
on their coordinates.

07:06.192 --> 07:09.228
- You know the risks, Mr O'Brien?
- Yes, sir.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.856
I think I can make it.

07:10.988 --> 07:14.024
- Alright, then. Good luck.
- Aye, sir.

07:23.708 --> 07:25.665
Mr O'Brien!

07:32.800 --> 07:36.465
- Nice of you to join us.
- Nice spot for a picnic, sir.

07:37.638 --> 07:41.931
We need to distribute these enhancer
rods at seven-metre lengths.

07:42.059 --> 07:43.517
That should do it.

07:43.643 --> 07:47.178
Will this storm front
interfere with the transport?

07:47.313 --> 07:49.935
I'd really like to get out
before it hits.

07:50.066 --> 07:52.058
I'm meant to feed the baby lunch.

07:52.193 --> 07:54.351
Molly gets in a foul mood
if I'm late.

07:54.487 --> 07:55.897
I'm with you!

08:01.994 --> 08:04.449
Lunchtime, Miles. Let's do it.

08:54.209 --> 08:55.751
Easy, Deanna.

08:55.877 --> 08:58.747
- Where...?
- On the Enterprise. You're OK.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.208
My skin's tingling.

09:00.340 --> 09:03.755
It's the after-images
of the electromagnetic discharge.

09:03.885 --> 09:05.628
The sensation will pass.

09:07.805 --> 09:09.382
They're all fine, too.

09:09.515 --> 09:13.643
Now, take your time, Counsellor.
Doctor's orders.

09:15.604 --> 09:19.019
- Injury report, Doctor.
- Mostly minor abrasions.

09:19.149 --> 09:21.984
Cmdr Riker took the worst of it.
A broken arm.

09:22.110 --> 09:25.810
- Mr Data. Good work, Chief.
- Thank you, sir.

09:25.947 --> 09:27.489
Ready for duty, sir.

09:27.615 --> 09:30.984
- Sure, Number One?
- It's not my first broken bone.

09:31.118 --> 09:34.653
- And how are you, Counsellor?
- Very glad to be here.

09:34.788 --> 09:36.247
Good. Let's go.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.363
So what happened?

09:39.501 --> 09:43.581
That storm moved in
faster than anything I've seen.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.421
Any evidence of life?

09:45.548 --> 09:48.917
No, but if Troi was right,
we were close to it.

09:49.051 --> 09:51.542
Bridge. How do you suggest
we proceed?

09:51.679 --> 09:55.012
We need to adjust the scanner
to penetrate the storms.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.551
Any ideas, Data?

09:56.684 --> 10:03.053
We can employ virtual imaging
to interpolate missing data.

10:03.190 --> 10:06.641
- Something wrong, Commander?
- My apologies, sir.

10:06.776 --> 10:11.734
It seems my speech processes
are experiencing a minor fluctuation.

10:11.864 --> 10:14.320
I will correct it in a moment.

10:15.618 --> 10:18.987
Captain, may I speak with you
for a moment in private?

10:19.121 --> 10:21.160
You have the bridge, Number One.

10:21.290 --> 10:23.697
Mr Data, deploy sensor scans.

10:23.834 --> 10:27.878
Take us to a synchronous orbit
aligned around our crash site.

10:28.004 --> 10:31.420
Sir, given the EM-field properties
of this moon,

10:31.549 --> 10:33.376
I recommend a search pattern

10:33.509 --> 10:36.131
beginning
in the southern polar region.

10:36.262 --> 10:41.422
The polar region?
That would be starting from scratch.

10:41.559 --> 10:45.508
Readings suggest that we begin
our scan around our crash site.

10:45.646 --> 10:48.481
The Essex's signal
was never clearly located.

10:48.607 --> 10:52.984
A survey of the moon from a
polar orbit might be more practical.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.391
You may be right.

10:54.529 --> 10:57.945
But I'd like to give the crash site
a once-over first.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.656
- Maintain our current orbit.
- Understood, sir.

11:02.536 --> 11:07.743
I've never felt anything like it.
It was as if they were calling to me.

11:09.042 --> 11:12.376
Someone was communicating
telepathically?

11:12.879 --> 11:16.924
Perhaps. For an instant.

11:17.050 --> 11:20.632
It was like their voices
were being carried on the wind.

11:21.137 --> 11:23.509
What were they trying
to communicate?

11:23.639 --> 11:25.964
I'm not sure.

11:26.100 --> 11:30.180
But they were calling me
to the southern polar region.

11:31.355 --> 11:35.055
I believe that's where
we should look for the Essex.

11:35.192 --> 11:38.560
Commander, did you override
my orbital heading?

11:38.695 --> 11:41.696
- Override?
- We've moved into a polar orbit.

11:41.823 --> 11:44.740
I'm locked out.
Helm isn't responding.

11:44.867 --> 11:48.616
Do you know anything about this,
Mr Data? Data?

11:51.665 --> 11:53.325
Security to the bridge!

12:03.176 --> 12:06.675
Computer, transfer command
to Engineering.

12:19.316 --> 12:21.107
- This way.
- What happened?

12:21.234 --> 12:22.894
He would not change course.

12:23.028 --> 12:25.400
The Captain would have done it
for me.

12:25.530 --> 12:26.989
Deck 36, Engineering.

12:27.741 --> 12:30.492
Computer, re-enable bridge control.

12:30.618 --> 12:34.153
Security protocol.
Authorisation, Riker Omega three.

12:34.288 --> 12:35.202
Report.

12:35.331 --> 12:38.497
Data, O'Brien and Troi
tried to take over the ship.

12:38.626 --> 12:42.374
They're in turbolift four.
Engaging override now.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.544
They've trapped us.

12:47.676 --> 12:49.668
- What deck is this?
- Deck ten.

12:49.803 --> 12:53.385
- Can you move us again?
- I can override bridge command.

12:53.514 --> 12:56.005
Activate security fields.

12:57.476 --> 13:01.344
Sir, the turbolift is moving again.
They're still inside.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.145
Initiate emergency bulkheads
in turboshaft four.

13:05.692 --> 13:07.934
They have been stopped at deck 13.

13:08.070 --> 13:09.564
Mr Worf.

13:42.894 --> 13:44.637
Can you deactivate this?

13:44.770 --> 13:48.353
We can't override
an emergency force-field command.

13:48.482 --> 13:52.182
My entity's artificial substructure
may be useful.

14:05.206 --> 14:08.906
They've broken through
the security field. Deck ten.

14:09.043 --> 14:10.786
Security to ten-forward.

14:18.885 --> 14:20.214
Momma's here.

14:25.892 --> 14:28.264
Everyone, get down on the floor.

14:29.770 --> 14:31.015
Miles?

14:34.108 --> 14:35.851
On the floor!

14:40.989 --> 14:43.314
Everyone, down, now!

14:45.619 --> 14:46.994
Miles!

15:08.598 --> 15:11.267
Multiple phaser shots, ten-forward.

15:11.392 --> 15:12.887
Picard to Worf. Report.

15:16.230 --> 15:20.275
Mr Worf, acknowledge.
Can you hear me, Mr Worf?

15:21.277 --> 15:24.728
Yes, bridge. He can hear you.

15:32.329 --> 15:34.120
Captain's log, supplemental.

15:34.247 --> 15:37.616
Following an aborted attempt
to take over the bridge,

15:37.750 --> 15:41.166
Troi, Data and O'Brien
have seized ten-forward.

15:41.295 --> 15:44.249
- Security teams at both entrances.
- Yes, sir.

15:44.381 --> 15:47.252
Shut down computer access
to ten-forward.

15:47.384 --> 15:50.835
I can't. They've set up
a remote security lockout.

15:50.971 --> 15:53.343
We'd have to shut down the saucer.

15:53.473 --> 15:58.431
Transporter room three, can you get
a lock on Data, Troi and O'Brien?

15:58.561 --> 16:00.803
Attempting to lock on, sir.

16:06.277 --> 16:09.942
They're attempting
to engage the transporters.

16:10.072 --> 16:13.488
- I know how to shut them down.
- Do it.

16:16.536 --> 16:20.664
Bridge, the transporter array
is in a diagnostic mode.

16:20.790 --> 16:24.918
I can't override. It'll take
a few hours to complete.

16:25.044 --> 16:27.250
How many people are down there?

16:27.380 --> 16:30.713
17. They just shut down
internal scanners, too.

16:31.759 --> 16:34.594
- Dr Crusher to the bridge.
- On my way.

16:35.220 --> 16:36.465
What are you doing?

16:36.597 --> 16:39.763
Reversing the force fields
to isolate this room.

16:39.891 --> 16:41.884
- Good.
- Their communicators.

16:42.018 --> 16:45.553
Now they'll learn nothing
except what we tell them.

16:45.688 --> 16:48.642
They've done something
to the force fields.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.019
Geordi?

16:50.151 --> 16:53.650
They've completely isolated
ten-forward.

16:53.779 --> 16:56.187
How about using anaesthezine gas?

16:56.323 --> 17:00.534
That won't affect Data.
We have to knock out all three.

17:00.661 --> 17:04.076
A concussive charge would blow out
the security fields.

17:04.205 --> 17:07.372
We could go in
and stun everybody.

17:10.627 --> 17:15.917
Doctor, check the biofilter readouts
of the away team's transport.

17:16.050 --> 17:19.999
See if you can come up
with any clue to explain this.

17:23.807 --> 17:29.145
Ten-forward, this is Capt Picard.
I will discuss this situation.

17:29.270 --> 17:31.726
There is no need
for further violence.

17:31.856 --> 17:34.264
Please, identify yourselves.

17:34.400 --> 17:40.153
They will attempt to negotiate the
safety and release of their people.

17:40.281 --> 17:43.447
Interesting.
Under normal circumstances,

17:43.575 --> 17:46.197
I would be counselling the Captain.

17:46.328 --> 17:47.988
What would you tell him to do?

17:48.121 --> 17:51.371
I would help him
find a way to secure our trust.

17:51.499 --> 17:53.326
What are you looking at?

17:59.215 --> 18:00.923
You, Klingon.

18:02.093 --> 18:03.338
Attack me.

18:13.395 --> 18:14.972
Are you afraid?

18:18.858 --> 18:21.230
I have no fear of death.

18:22.195 --> 18:24.353
And I have no fear of killing you.

18:24.488 --> 18:25.899
Stop it!

18:40.837 --> 18:43.079
Please respond, ten-forward.

18:43.214 --> 18:46.334
Do any of my crew
require medical assistance?

18:46.467 --> 18:49.088
We can discuss your wounded.

18:49.887 --> 18:53.386
But first, you will move the ship.

18:55.476 --> 18:57.219
Move it where?

18:57.352 --> 19:01.302
Change orbit to an inclination
of 80 degrees south.

19:02.232 --> 19:05.814
The southern polar region,
where Data tried to move the ship.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.648
That's what Troi asked me to do.
But why?

19:08.780 --> 19:13.904
Ten-forward, if you could be more
specific about our destination...

19:14.034 --> 19:17.450
You have 30 seconds
to change your heading,

19:17.579 --> 19:23.166
or additional members of your crew
will require medical attention.

19:24.669 --> 19:29.165
We need to stabilise this situation.
Play for time.

19:29.299 --> 19:32.963
I suggest that we move the ship
as they've asked. Agreed?

19:33.886 --> 19:37.469
Set a new heading, but take us there
as slowly as you can.

19:37.598 --> 19:41.512
Ten-forward, we are moving the ship
as you requested.

19:44.688 --> 19:48.139
He's telling the truth.
Their heading has changed.

19:52.320 --> 19:55.902
I compared the away team's
last transporter patterns

19:56.032 --> 19:57.775
to their earlier records.

19:57.908 --> 20:01.740
They're exactly the same,
except in Data, Troi and O'Brien

20:01.870 --> 20:05.156
there's unusual synaptic activity.
Anionic energy.

20:05.290 --> 20:09.122
It might be a life form
superimposing its neural patterns.

20:09.252 --> 20:12.455
- Why wasn't I affected?
- I don't know.

20:12.589 --> 20:15.839
The only difference
is that you were injured.

20:15.967 --> 20:19.632
- My broken arm.
- It caused pain receptors to fire.

20:19.762 --> 20:22.632
It may have made you immune
to this energy.

20:22.765 --> 20:27.510
What would happen if we were
to inflict pain on the others?

20:27.644 --> 20:30.562
It might force whatever it is
out of them.

20:30.689 --> 20:34.686
A plasma shock would be painful,
but wouldn't harm them.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.818
I could hook up a laser
to a plasma inverter.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.191
What about Data?

20:39.322 --> 20:44.280
It will definitely overload
his neural net. It'll work on him.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.079
We have to penetrate
the force field.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.991
I could interrupt it
for a few seconds,

20:50.124 --> 20:52.116
but timing would be critical.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.741
We have to hit all three
with one discharge.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.871
If they're together, it'll be fine.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.583
How will you gain access?

20:58.715 --> 21:01.336
A micro-optic drill
through the ceiling.

21:01.467 --> 21:05.880
We have to have some way to contain
or neutralise this anionic energy

21:06.013 --> 21:07.805
once it's out of our people.

21:07.932 --> 21:12.759
Yes, Doctor, that will be
your top priority. Proceed.

21:12.895 --> 21:17.058
Bridge to ten-forward,
now that we are moving the ship,

21:17.190 --> 21:20.310
I want to know the nature
of the injuries to my crew.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.774
Five of your people are injured.

21:23.905 --> 21:26.360
How serious is their condition?

21:28.534 --> 21:30.491
You, Klingon, tell him.

21:31.787 --> 21:35.867
One person has what looks like
a level-five phaser hit.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.867
Four have secondary burns.
They require medical attention.

21:40.003 --> 21:43.917
- Our captors are not affected...
- Silence, Klingon!

21:44.049 --> 21:45.247
Ten-forward,

21:45.383 --> 21:48.918
you must release these people
for medical attention.

21:49.053 --> 21:51.295
I will release no one.

21:52.265 --> 21:56.344
If you will release them,
I will take their place.

21:57.478 --> 22:02.389
I don't trust him.
It may be a deception.

22:02.524 --> 22:06.853
The crew values Picard's life
above all others.

22:06.987 --> 22:11.280
Capt Picard,
we agree to your proposal.

22:11.991 --> 22:15.360
- Expect a Medical team.
- Acknowledged.

22:15.495 --> 22:19.990
Sickbay, have an emergency
Medical team outside ten-forward.

22:20.124 --> 22:23.243
Putting you there
strengthens their position.

22:23.377 --> 22:27.920
While they're on board this ship,
I'm a hostage. We all are.

22:28.048 --> 22:30.539
We must find out
who we're dealing with.

22:30.675 --> 22:34.340
If La Forge and Ro can attempt
a rescue, let them proceed.

22:34.471 --> 22:39.713
If they can't, I will provide you
with an opportunity. Watch for it.

22:41.310 --> 22:42.769
Yes, sir.

22:58.618 --> 23:00.990
Silence that child!

23:10.796 --> 23:12.753
I know you.

23:19.012 --> 23:21.004
I know who you are.

23:25.768 --> 23:28.010
And I know what this is.

23:30.648 --> 23:34.515
She's frightened!
Why don't you just let us go?

23:35.652 --> 23:37.775
No.

23:37.904 --> 23:39.861
Make it stop!

23:44.369 --> 23:47.239
Ten-forward,
we're outside the door.

23:47.372 --> 23:49.198
Lower the force field.

23:59.591 --> 24:03.754
Welcome, Captain.
Allow me to introduce myself.

24:04.346 --> 24:08.888
I am Capt Bryce Shumar
of the Federation Starship Essex.

24:16.857 --> 24:19.775
The Essex vanished
over 200 years ago.

24:19.902 --> 24:22.606
Indeed. I know. I was there.

24:23.739 --> 24:27.439
This is my first officer,
Cmdr Steven Mullen.

24:27.576 --> 24:31.703
And my security chief,
Lt Morgan Kelly.

24:36.876 --> 24:40.790
And you have survived
all this time as...?

24:40.921 --> 24:46.260
Spirits? Ghosts? But you're a man
who would never believe in ghosts.

24:46.385 --> 24:50.845
Isn't that true?
You see, Troi knows you.

24:50.972 --> 24:53.048
And so I do as well.

24:53.183 --> 24:55.852
Then Counsellor Troi is still alive?

24:55.977 --> 25:00.852
Of course she is. I have no wish
to harm her or to harm anyone else.

25:00.982 --> 25:02.808
I'm pleased to hear that.

25:02.942 --> 25:08.066
We have been forced to take this
action because we need your help.

25:08.197 --> 25:09.477
My help?

25:09.615 --> 25:14.193
Our consciousness has been trapped
on this moon for two centuries.

25:14.327 --> 25:16.201
We must escape this torture.

25:18.331 --> 25:20.122
How did this happen to you?

25:23.336 --> 25:28.211
I can't explain how it happened.
I only know that it did.

25:29.550 --> 25:32.634
The Essex was caught
in an electromagnetic storm,

25:32.761 --> 25:35.003
just as your shuttle was.

25:35.138 --> 25:39.966
Moments before we crashed,
the bridge was struck by lightning.

25:40.101 --> 25:42.141
The ship was ripped apart.

25:43.229 --> 25:45.305
Somehow, in that instant,

25:45.439 --> 25:50.944
our consciousness was absorbed into
the magnetic currents on the surface.

25:52.655 --> 25:55.940
Why didn't you tell us this?
Why the deception?

25:57.075 --> 25:58.867
The violence?

25:58.994 --> 26:03.786
Because, as I said,
I knew you would not believe us.

26:05.750 --> 26:08.288
Even now, I know you don't.

26:08.419 --> 26:11.918
What was your vessel's designation
and complement?

26:12.048 --> 26:18.216
NCC-173. Daedalus-class starship.
Crew, 229.

26:18.345 --> 26:19.887
Under whose command?

26:20.013 --> 26:22.848
Admiral Uttan Narsu. Starbase 12.

26:22.974 --> 26:26.343
You will find all this
in Starfleet records.

26:26.478 --> 26:31.186
- I don't need to see the records.
- Then you know I am correct.

26:34.402 --> 26:39.740
End this, and I will give you
whatever help you need.

26:42.367 --> 26:43.743
No.

26:43.869 --> 26:49.289
You don't trust us.
And I can't risk trusting you.

26:49.416 --> 26:52.915
It's taking too long.
We should have been there by now.

26:53.044 --> 26:54.621
He is manipulating you.

26:54.754 --> 26:57.838
Capt Picard
has every right to be curious.

26:57.965 --> 27:00.503
He will delay
until a rescue is possible.

27:00.634 --> 27:01.963
I know that.

27:04.221 --> 27:09.463
I also know he will make every effort
to protect the lives of his people.

27:10.310 --> 27:13.761
Since our demands
are not excessive, Captain,

27:13.897 --> 27:17.976
I hope you will see
that it will be simpler to accede

27:18.109 --> 27:20.397
than to risk further injuries.

27:21.779 --> 27:23.059
What do you want?

27:23.197 --> 27:27.657
All you need to know for now
is that we want to rest.

27:28.952 --> 27:33.448
Simply, finally, to rest.

27:38.127 --> 27:39.752
Section two.

27:40.630 --> 27:42.172
B.

27:45.259 --> 27:46.883
A.

27:47.011 --> 27:48.339
Section one.

27:48.470 --> 27:52.550
Finally! I never want to see
this part of the Enterprise again.

27:52.683 --> 27:57.510
I hear you. This is what starship
designers call "easy access".

27:58.813 --> 28:01.304
Yeah. Yeah, this is it.

28:01.441 --> 28:05.485
I thought we might have a problem
with conduit number 227,

28:05.611 --> 28:08.980
but it looks like
we're gonna be able to get by it.

28:25.338 --> 28:26.832
Thanks.

28:33.262 --> 28:36.298
- We're through.
- Good.

28:36.432 --> 28:39.800
Let's hook up the scanner
and see what we've got.

28:46.775 --> 28:48.601
Got it.

28:49.652 --> 28:52.985
All three have to be in the circle
for this to work.

28:53.614 --> 28:58.323
We're halfway home. La Forge
to Crusher, how are you doing?

28:58.452 --> 29:00.943
I have an idea
for a containment field.

29:01.079 --> 29:03.487
This anionic energy seems vulnerable

29:03.623 --> 29:06.458
to the magnetic-flux density
in the storms.

29:06.585 --> 29:08.127
If we can duplicate it,

29:08.253 --> 29:09.830
we can trap it.

29:09.963 --> 29:13.794
You could flood ten-forward
with ionogenic particles.

29:13.925 --> 29:15.798
Exactly what I was thinking.

29:15.927 --> 29:19.426
How long will it take
to get it all ready?

29:19.555 --> 29:22.924
We still have to calibrate
the plasma invert.

29:23.058 --> 29:25.347
My guess is 45 minutes to an hour.

29:25.477 --> 29:27.635
The containment field will be ready.

29:27.771 --> 29:29.645
Keep me advised.

29:39.156 --> 29:41.279
Impressions, Mr Worf.

29:43.077 --> 29:48.035
Spiritual possessions have been
reported throughout Klingon history.

29:48.165 --> 29:52.209
It is called Jat'yln,
the taking of the living by the dead.

29:52.335 --> 29:56.084
Human history
is full of many similar legends.

29:56.214 --> 29:59.417
Then you believe
they may be telling the truth?

30:01.260 --> 30:03.087
Not for one moment.

30:03.220 --> 30:07.929
They know much about the Essex.
If it is the spirit of Capt Shumar...

30:08.058 --> 30:11.178
Then he should be behaving
very much better.

30:11.311 --> 30:15.605
- A Starfleet captain.
- You two, sit down.

30:15.732 --> 30:20.358
Living disembodied for two centuries.
Perhaps they've gone mad.

30:20.487 --> 30:24.021
I assure you, Mr Worf,
these are not Jat'yln.

30:24.157 --> 30:28.534
Our job is to find out exactly
what they are, and how to deal...

30:28.661 --> 30:33.073
Right, that's enough. Sit down.
You, over there. You, there.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.953
- Down!
- I gave you that.

30:44.634 --> 30:48.714
In a place called McKinley Park.
Green grass.

30:48.846 --> 30:51.171
- Tall trees.
- Please don't.

30:51.307 --> 30:53.595
I hid the bracelet in your pocket.

30:54.268 --> 30:57.802
- You were surprised.
- Don't!

30:59.481 --> 31:04.439
You said,
"Miles, you make me feel so happy."

31:10.491 --> 31:12.899
No! Get away from me!

31:13.035 --> 31:15.194
Leave her alone.

31:25.630 --> 31:27.255
Capt Shumar.

31:27.382 --> 31:33.254
We're approaching the southern polar
region. I need to give instructions.

31:33.971 --> 31:38.099
Very well.
We're taking you to our crash site.

31:38.684 --> 31:42.100
- The southern pole?
- That is correct.

31:43.439 --> 31:48.065
Nothing our sensors could detect
indicated the Essex went down there.

31:48.193 --> 31:53.614
As I told you, Captain,
the ship broke up in the atmosphere,

31:53.740 --> 31:56.313
and the bridge went down here.

31:56.451 --> 31:57.826
When we reach it,

31:57.952 --> 32:02.032
you will beam what's left
of our skeletal remains on board,

32:02.164 --> 32:05.533
and then take them back to Earth
for a proper burial.

32:05.668 --> 32:09.250
You see how simple a request this is?

32:10.505 --> 32:12.083
Captain...

32:14.384 --> 32:17.135
...if you will let these people go,

32:17.262 --> 32:20.262
I'll order the bridge
to follow your instructions.

32:20.390 --> 32:22.133
I will release no one.

32:22.266 --> 32:25.849
If you are who you say you are,
there's no need for this.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.721
We'll gladly take you home.

32:27.855 --> 32:32.232
I wish you were truly
as open-minded as you say, Picard.

32:32.359 --> 32:35.064
Release the hostages
or I won't cooperate.

32:35.195 --> 32:37.234
You'll cooperate, Captain.

32:37.364 --> 32:40.234
You will cooperate,
or someone will die.

32:40.867 --> 32:42.906
Who shall it be?

32:43.036 --> 32:46.072
How about the Klingon?

32:47.456 --> 32:48.785
Get another one.

32:52.252 --> 32:53.877
You.

32:57.299 --> 32:58.709
Come on.

33:03.930 --> 33:08.841
Pick one to die, Captain,
or I kill them both.

33:14.523 --> 33:17.192
They're all in range.
I have to do it now.

33:17.317 --> 33:20.900
I can only shut down the force field
for seven seconds.

33:21.029 --> 33:24.528
If they're the right seven seconds,
it'll be enough.

33:24.658 --> 33:27.611
Prepare to release
the ionogenic field.

33:27.744 --> 33:28.858
Standing by.

33:28.995 --> 33:32.161
- Ready?
- Lower force field.

33:32.290 --> 33:35.954
- Force field down.
- Firing plasma charge.

33:42.341 --> 33:43.799
Damn!

33:46.052 --> 33:50.513
Tell them to stop, or I kill everyone
in this room, starting with you.

33:53.726 --> 33:56.347
Picard to bridge, abort immediately.

33:57.772 --> 33:59.729
As you say, Captain.

33:59.857 --> 34:04.104
Riker to La Forge,
return to the bridge.

34:25.505 --> 34:29.668
- Are you ready to cooperate?
- Yes.

34:49.777 --> 34:52.103
First Officer's log, supplemental.

34:52.239 --> 34:56.283
The Enterprise is in orbit
near the southern polar region.

34:56.409 --> 34:59.114
We await further instructions.

34:59.788 --> 35:02.457
- Any sign of the Essex?
- Negative.

35:02.582 --> 35:06.164
Electromagnetic disturbances
are even worse here.

35:06.294 --> 35:07.918
Bridge to ten-forward.

35:08.045 --> 35:12.043
Intense storm activity
makes it virtually impossible

35:12.174 --> 35:15.175
for us to pick up
any trace of the Essex.

35:15.302 --> 35:17.971
We are giving you
the exact coordinates

35:18.096 --> 35:20.669
of our remains on board the Essex.

35:24.102 --> 35:27.138
I'm receiving those coordinates now.

35:27.271 --> 35:29.063
Can you tell what's there?

35:29.190 --> 35:32.605
Just your basic ionic cyclone.
I can't read a thing.

35:32.735 --> 35:35.854
I'm not beaming up
whatever might be down there.

35:35.988 --> 35:40.365
You've got a good excuse.
Transporters wouldn't work.

35:40.492 --> 35:41.986
Bridge to ten-forward.

35:42.118 --> 35:46.068
Whatever's blocking our scanners
will block the transporters.

35:46.206 --> 35:47.285
They're lying!

35:47.415 --> 35:50.535
We've had difficulties
with the transporters.

35:50.668 --> 35:52.744
That's why we sent the shuttle.

35:52.878 --> 35:55.963
- You should know.
- We have to use the transporters.

35:56.090 --> 36:00.798
Mr O'Brien safely executed
the return of the away team.

36:00.928 --> 36:06.135
He's the most qualified person
to operate the transporters.

36:06.266 --> 36:10.310
- Can you do it from here?
- No. I need a transporter pad.

36:10.436 --> 36:14.932
I could give you safe passage

36:15.066 --> 36:17.687
to a transporter pad
in a cargo bay.

36:18.736 --> 36:21.487
It is a trick.
He is trying to divide us.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.653
We must not be separated.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.822
I can give you all safe passage.

36:25.951 --> 36:28.193
Why are you suddenly so helpful?

36:28.328 --> 36:31.744
I assume that if you choose
to go to the cargo bay,

36:31.873 --> 36:36.700
then you won't take all the hostages.
Their safety is my priority.

36:36.836 --> 36:39.541
What are the risks
when we leave this room?

36:39.672 --> 36:42.875
Without the force fields,
we are vulnerable.

36:43.008 --> 36:48.464
They could use the transporter.
They could beam us to the surface.

36:48.597 --> 36:51.966
But there is a way
to neutralise that threat.

36:54.728 --> 36:59.140
Bridge, transfer all transporter
functions to ten-forward.

36:59.273 --> 37:00.768
In order to do that,

37:00.900 --> 37:04.269
you will have to release
your computer lockouts.

37:04.403 --> 37:07.570
- That's not true.
- Let me talk to him.

37:08.824 --> 37:13.450
Number One, I think we have
an opportunity to end this siege.

37:13.578 --> 37:17.030
It will require the cooperation
of all concerned.

37:17.165 --> 37:22.123
Our guests will be moving shortly
to cargo bay four,

37:22.253 --> 37:24.661
from where the transport will occur.

37:24.797 --> 37:27.881
I want you to ensure them
of safe passage

37:28.008 --> 37:31.508
between ten-forward
and the cargo bay.

37:31.637 --> 37:33.546
Understood, Captain.

37:33.680 --> 37:37.381
- Doctor. Mr La Forge.
- Yes, sir.

37:38.560 --> 37:42.142
Transporter controls
are being transferred.

37:43.565 --> 37:48.440
Ten-forward to bridge.
I said all transporter controls!

37:48.569 --> 37:52.270
Including all those
aboard your shuttlecraft.

37:52.948 --> 37:56.483
Almost had them, Ensign. Nice try.

37:56.994 --> 38:01.205
Riker to ten-forward. Remaining
transporter functions transferred.

38:05.376 --> 38:07.665
Once we create our own access code,

38:07.795 --> 38:10.630
no one can use the transporter
against us.

38:10.756 --> 38:13.294
What about the weapons?

38:14.760 --> 38:18.461
We will each take a hostage.
For protection.

38:18.597 --> 38:23.057
- Klingon.
- Picard, you are mine.

38:28.106 --> 38:30.478
Please let her stay.

38:35.863 --> 38:37.737
Lower the force field.

38:42.453 --> 38:46.201
- Security teams, stand by.
- They're in section five.

39:10.312 --> 39:13.562
They'll be at their destination
in less than a minute.

39:13.690 --> 39:15.481
They stopped at deck 18.

39:15.608 --> 39:18.609
Security, allow them access
to cargo bay four.

39:21.989 --> 39:24.314
I will require assistance.

39:28.078 --> 39:35.623
Capt Shumar, how do you intend to
achieve this rest that you so desire?

39:35.752 --> 39:37.032
What do you mean?

39:37.170 --> 39:41.464
How do you intend
to free yourselves of this existence

39:41.591 --> 39:44.164
that has so trapped
your consciousness?

39:44.302 --> 39:46.971
It will fade as we move
from this planet.

39:47.096 --> 39:50.346
Really? What is
your scientific basis for that?

39:50.474 --> 39:54.970
I don't need a scientific basis.
Just be quiet.

39:55.103 --> 39:58.519
When are you going to tell me
who you really are?

39:59.316 --> 40:02.566
I've initialised
the transporter signal.

40:03.528 --> 40:05.105
Proceed.

40:08.574 --> 40:11.943
- They're firing up the transporter.
- Mr La Forge?

40:12.077 --> 40:15.446
I've isolated cargo bay four
with a neutrino field.

40:15.581 --> 40:19.874
It will only take Data and O'Brien
a few minutes to override it.

40:20.001 --> 40:22.539
I hope it gives the Captain
enough time.

40:22.671 --> 40:24.331
Do you know what he'll do?

40:24.464 --> 40:27.833
There's only one reason
he chose cargo bay four.

40:27.967 --> 40:30.256
If it becomes necessary,

40:30.386 --> 40:34.384
you'll blow the cargo bay hatch
on my orders.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.009
Yes, sir.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.518
You're right, Picard.

40:47.652 --> 40:51.270
It's not rest we seek, only escape.

40:51.406 --> 40:52.864
Escape?

40:52.990 --> 40:56.655
We were brought to this moon
over five centuries ago,

40:56.786 --> 40:59.905
from a star system called Ux-Mal.

41:00.039 --> 41:04.831
We were separated from our bodies
and left to drift in the storms.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.744
Once we almost escaped,
on board the Essex.

41:08.880 --> 41:13.127
But that ship could not elude
this moon's electromagnetic storms.

41:13.259 --> 41:16.924
You thought using their identities
would gain our sympathy?

41:17.054 --> 41:18.928
It was better than asking you

41:19.056 --> 41:22.390
to allow hundreds
of condemned prisoners on board.

41:23.561 --> 41:26.016
Then this moon is a penal colony.

41:27.189 --> 41:28.897
That's correct.

41:29.566 --> 41:34.726
But now we have your ship
and your bodies to carry us home.

41:36.739 --> 41:39.230
I'm reading dozens of them. Hundreds.

41:39.367 --> 41:43.614
They have the same anionic signature
we saw on the biophoto scans.

41:43.746 --> 41:46.663
We can give the Captain
a new bargaining chip.

41:46.790 --> 41:51.002
Dr Crusher, flood the cargo bay
with your containment field.

41:56.549 --> 41:57.794
No!

41:59.010 --> 42:03.339
- Let them go or you will all die!
- Your threats are meaningless.

42:03.473 --> 42:07.007
We are still in control
of these three bodies.

42:07.143 --> 42:11.888
Will you sacrifice the others? They
will die when the hatch is blown.

42:12.022 --> 42:16.648
- You will die too, Picard.
- I would die to save my child.

42:16.777 --> 42:20.441
To die defending one's ship
is the hope of every Klingon.

42:20.572 --> 42:23.442
If you each know
the officers you inhabit,

42:23.575 --> 42:26.943
then you know they would
give their lives for this ship.

42:27.078 --> 42:32.368
Free them now and I will
return you to the moon's surface.

42:42.592 --> 42:47.053
I advise you, Picard,
not to pass our way again.

42:53.060 --> 42:56.394
Picard to bridge.
Our guests are leaving shortly.

42:56.522 --> 43:00.436
- I need an emergency Medical team.
- On our way.

43:00.567 --> 43:07.981
Mr Worf, prepare to transport these
prisoners down to the moon's surface.

43:08.116 --> 43:10.155
Gladly, sir.

43:17.917 --> 43:21.416
Captain's log, stardate 45572.1.

43:21.545 --> 43:24.996
Dr Crusher has examined
Troi, Data and O'Brien.

43:25.132 --> 43:27.801
There seem to be
no residual effects.

43:28.552 --> 43:32.419
It was as if my own consciousness
were pushed to the side.

43:32.555 --> 43:37.300
I watched everything, heard my voice,
but wasn't able to control it.

43:37.435 --> 43:41.847
The entity that controlled you,
what were your perceptions?

43:41.981 --> 43:44.650
He was intelligent, actually.

43:44.775 --> 43:47.941
Thoughtful,
in a ruthless kind of way.

43:48.070 --> 43:49.694
Cold.

43:49.821 --> 43:53.605
I must apologise
for my inadvertent misconduct.

43:53.742 --> 43:58.736
- No apology necessary.
- Your restraint was most remarkable.

43:58.871 --> 44:00.947
You have no idea.

44:01.999 --> 44:04.537
- How do you feel?
- Hungry.

44:04.668 --> 44:06.625
That's a good sign.

44:08.213 --> 44:09.873
Go home.

44:11.633 --> 44:13.460
How do you feel?

44:13.593 --> 44:15.965
I'm just glad to have you back.

44:16.805 --> 44:20.588
If I could have killed
that thing inside me, I would have.

44:20.725 --> 44:23.512
I know. We both know.
