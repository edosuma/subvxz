01:17.699 --> 01:19.100
Watch this.

01:22.706 --> 01:23.922
Smooth, Michelangelo.

01:24.343 --> 01:26.255
As a ninja, you make
a great break dancer.

01:26.893 --> 01:28.532
I would advise more practice.

01:29.324 --> 01:31.821
Yeah ! And less pizza !

01:32.867 --> 01:34.195
Your turn, Raphael.

01:34.851 --> 01:35.989
Ok, sensei.

01:36.427 --> 01:37.568
But i gotta warn you...

01:38.056 --> 01:39.380
I got the reflexes of a...

01:40.673 --> 01:42.176
Of a banana slug ?

01:44.485 --> 01:45.422
I've got it !

01:47.276 --> 01:48.526
No. I've got it !

01:49.289 --> 01:50.258
Whatever it is.

01:50.747 --> 01:52.980
It's a tracking device.
I put it together

01:53.476 --> 01:54.957
Out of circuits i got
from the alien ship.

01:55.394 --> 01:58.848
It should help us locate the second
fragment of the eye of Zarnov.

01:59.314 --> 02:00.905
Oh, radical, dude !

02:01.295 --> 02:02.481
Let's boogie !

02:02.825 --> 02:04.322
Slow down, Michelangelo.

02:04.682 --> 02:05.884
We'll need disguises.

02:06.211 --> 02:08.103
No problemo, man.

02:08.679 --> 02:09.713
I'll handle it.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.347
This is your idea of a disguise ?

02:13.801 --> 02:15.734
I think it's kinda "cash."

02:16.078 --> 02:17.157
What does it say ?

02:17.534 --> 02:19.611
Can't you hear ?
It says, "beep, beep, beep."

02:20.136 --> 02:21.858
It says we're getting close.

02:23.463 --> 02:24.555
We got something !

02:24.930 --> 02:26.289
The fragment is very close !

02:34.485 --> 02:37.251
Cowabunga !
A bank robbery.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.090
That's what they think !

02:43.365 --> 02:45.881
The turtles ! Can they
have traced the whereabouts

02:46.275 --> 02:47.944
of the second fragment as well ?

02:48.286 --> 02:50.671
Impossible, master.
Only someone of my genius...

02:51.219 --> 02:54.341
I--i mean, your genius
could've calculated it's trajectory

02:54.860 --> 02:55.763
from the alien ship.

02:56.246 --> 02:57.876
You had better be right.

02:59.837 --> 03:00.646
What are they ?

03:00.928 --> 03:02.601
Some kind of green monsters !

03:03.006 --> 03:04.307
Is that an insult ?

03:04.662 --> 03:06.797
The fragment had better
be there, Baxter,

03:07.078 --> 03:08.161
for your sake.

03:08.639 --> 03:09.640
Now retrieve it !

03:10.075 --> 03:12.403
Me ? Why me ?

03:12.964 --> 03:16.809
Because swine like you
understand garbage.

03:17.227 --> 03:18.570
Now do as i say !

03:18.990 --> 03:19.882
Yes, master.

03:30.697 --> 03:32.663
Hurry, you fool,
before the turtles return !

03:33.508 --> 03:35.583
I've got it !
The second fragment !

03:35.947 --> 03:37.040
Give it to me.

03:39.398 --> 03:41.142
Great, master.
I'll come with you !

03:41.549 --> 03:44.064
All right, but stay downwind.

03:59.459 --> 04:00.423
Let 'em have it !

04:00.795 --> 04:01.656
Well, thanks a lot, guys.

04:02.030 --> 04:03.245
You didn't leave anything
for me to do.

04:03.622 --> 04:06.015
Oh, you can clean up the
mess. How's that ? 

04:06.386 --> 04:08.523
Hey ! The fragment is moving.

04:09.262 --> 04:10.553
Then we'd better move, too.

04:11.052 --> 04:13.177
Yeah, let's get our shells in gear !

04:13.785 --> 04:15.361
The police can take it from here.

04:15.884 --> 04:16.737
Taxi !

04:18.720 --> 04:21.047
Goin' to a costume party, mac ?

04:23.792 --> 04:31.127
Come back here !

04:32.284 --> 04:34.315
Oh, it's too late !
It's out of range.

04:35.079 --> 04:36.309
What nerve !

04:36.737 --> 04:40.264
Some creep with a metal face

04:41.289 --> 04:42.273
stole my hack !

04:42.603 --> 04:43.163
Shredder !
Come on.

04:43.802 --> 04:45.583
We've got to find him !

04:49.379 --> 04:51.703
What is happening to this city ?

04:52.732 --> 04:55.812
It used to be such
a refined center o' culture.

04:57.727 --> 05:00.944
My plan is as ingenious
as it is simple, Krang.

05:01.382 --> 05:04.491
Baxter says that the fragment,
when hooked up to a computer,

05:04.774 --> 05:06.534
will give us unlimited power.

05:08.314 --> 05:10.861
What kind of power, Shredder ?

05:11.749 --> 05:14.948
We're not quite sure yet,

05:15.329 --> 05:16.482
but i assure you it will be great 
enough

05:16.759 --> 05:17.678
to destroy the turtles.

05:18.803 --> 05:21.197
I'll believe it when I see it.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.831
Krang out.

05:23.455 --> 05:26.472
I'll show that blob of brains !

05:27.014 --> 05:29.989
Come. We must find a
computer of incredible power

05:30.376 --> 05:32.198
to hook that fragment up to.

05:32.619 --> 05:34.071
Yes, master.
Coming, master !

05:34.339 --> 05:35.630
Good idea, master.

05:36.414 --> 05:39.164
You must find the second fragment.

05:39.565 --> 05:41.815
It could cause great
harm in Shredder's hands.

05:42.485 --> 05:45.123
Maybe if Donatello's
tracer had more power,

05:45.531 --> 05:47.371
it could pick up the signal again.

05:47.906 --> 05:50.027
Exactly.
I could hook it up

05:50.275 --> 05:51.465
to the scanner in the turtle van.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.145
Great, I'm getting something !

06:01.295 --> 06:03.247
Yours truly will handle this.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.191
Looks like the alien circuitry

06:11.754 --> 06:13.334
doesn't mesh too well with our stuff.

06:13.785 --> 06:15.126
It's really comforting

06:15.348 --> 06:16.844
knowing that you've figured that out.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.734
Are you sure this will work ?

06:21.172 --> 06:22.486
Trust me, master.

06:22.872 --> 06:24.337
Hook it up, quickly !

06:24.775 --> 06:25.936
Greetings.

06:26.509 --> 06:27.365
Who...

06:27.619 --> 06:28.914
Or what--are you ?

06:29.429 --> 06:31.550
I am o.m.n.s.s...

06:31.944 --> 06:35.780
Omnipotent Multiprocessing
Nexus Sub-universal sentience.

06:36.701 --> 06:37.999
A thinking machine ?

06:38.346 --> 06:39.606
Artificial Intelligence ?

06:39.998 --> 06:42.494
I prefer the real thing.

06:43.104 --> 06:44.746
A disbeliever, eh ?

06:52.456 --> 06:53.844
Parlor tricks !

06:54.310 --> 06:55.844
Those are of no use to me.

06:56.369 --> 06:59.229
This is nothing compared to
what i am capable of doing !

06:59.593 --> 07:01.305
With a stronger power source,

07:01.677 --> 07:04.520
I could control
every machine in this city.

07:04.769 --> 07:06.255
Then you shall have it, my friend.

07:06.611 --> 07:07.907
You shall have it !

07:08.940 --> 07:11.312
I don't get it. Why are
we asking April for help ?

07:11.889 --> 07:13.812
Because April has all
kinds of news contacts

07:14.156 --> 07:14.953
in the city.

07:15.259 --> 07:17.383
That's right. If anything truly
weird has happened lately,

07:17.757 --> 07:18.868
she'll know about it.

07:19.215 --> 07:21.492
Oh, like the turtle van turning on us

07:21.753 --> 07:22.596
isn't weird enough.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.925
There. I've given that... creation

07:25.256 --> 07:26.577
the power you requested.

07:26.891 --> 07:28.200
But i still say it won't work.

07:28.735 --> 07:31.062
Silence, you feeble mortal !

07:31.578 --> 07:34.525
I detect something interesting.

07:35.116 --> 07:37.334
Mutant life form readings.

07:37.662 --> 07:39.066
It must be the turtles !

07:39.395 --> 07:41.642
O.m.n.s.s., destroy them !

07:55.025 --> 07:56.380
April, we need you !

07:56.897 --> 07:58.378
Meeting in broad daylight ?

07:58.740 --> 07:59.958
It must be something teally big !

08:00.315 --> 08:01.687
No, duh.

08:02.030 --> 08:03.674
We've got mondo problems.

08:04.249 --> 08:06.034
It's Shredder.
He's up to something,

08:06.579 --> 08:07.765
But we're not sure what.

08:08.198 --> 08:09.366
What's that ?

08:18.874 --> 08:21.205
The machines...
They've got us surrounded.

08:21.732 --> 08:23.871
It's a dead end.

08:24.167 --> 08:26.556
Did you have to use the "d" word ?

08:27.100 --> 08:30.085
I knew i should've brought a hardhat.

08:37.544 --> 08:39.029
There's no one driving them !

08:41.274 --> 08:43.043
Let's haul shell !

08:54.752 --> 08:56.887
Nice try, but no cigar.

09:07.412 --> 09:09.207
The turtles are finished.

09:11.750 --> 09:12.794
Well ?

09:13.141 --> 09:15.433
Everything is proceeding
according to plan.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.148
I have taken care of the turtles,

09:17.493 --> 09:20.650
and now I'm going
to take over the city !

09:20.976 --> 09:22.565
You'll pardon me

09:22.924 --> 09:25.881
if i don't start packing immediately !

09:33.369 --> 09:34.212
Oh, swell.

09:42.406 --> 09:43.926
Whoa ! What are you doin', bud ?

09:47.529 --> 09:49.495
We've got to turn them
against each other.

09:49.791 --> 09:50.996
It's our only chance.

10:06.595 --> 10:08.260
Leonardo, help !

10:19.016 --> 10:21.310
So, you want to get down
and party, huh ?

10:22.473 --> 10:24.088
Primo notion !

10:25.075 --> 10:27.103
We're gonna have a blast !

10:27.823 --> 10:28.976
Where's Michelangelo ?

10:29.412 --> 10:30.727
Look !

10:33.376 --> 10:35.563
Michelangelo, run for it !

10:35.943 --> 10:37.516
Take cover !

10:38.390 --> 10:45.574
I'll say one thing
...knowing you fellas is never dull.

10:46.258 --> 10:49.863
Oh, no ! My mobile unit is ruined !

10:50.502 --> 10:52.459
How am i gonna explain
this to my boss ?

10:53.052 --> 10:54.031
We'll deal with that later.

10:54.439 --> 10:57.002
Right now, We have to scope
out that second fragment.

10:57.401 --> 10:59.337
Yeah. Somehow,
Shredder's using it

10:59.556 --> 11:00.810
to control machines.

11:01.148 --> 11:03.757
So, like, what do we do about it ?

11:03.994 --> 11:05.098
We'll think of something.

11:05.318 --> 11:06.536
For now, let's get out of here.

11:09.952 --> 11:10.891
They got away !

11:11.160 --> 11:12.906
The turtles must be destroyed

11:13.262 --> 11:15.901
Before i can implement
my plan of conquest !

11:16.400 --> 11:18.900
I will need more power to do so.

11:19.256 --> 11:21.024
"More power, more power."

11:21.398 --> 11:22.896
Do not bother.

11:23.226 --> 11:24.788
I'll gather it myself.

11:36.693 --> 11:37.680
Now....

11:37.943 --> 11:41.350
Witness the power of o.m.n.s.s. !

11:41.755 --> 11:43.361
The situation seems very bad.

11:43.767 --> 11:46.669
If Shredder has found a
way to control machinery,

11:47.045 --> 11:49.667
he could soon turn the
entire city against us.

11:50.026 --> 11:51.227
If we don't find him soon,

11:51.916 --> 11:53.696
we're cooked turtles
on the half shell.

11:55.008 --> 11:56.145
We interrupt this program

11:56.442 --> 11:57.882
for a channel 6 special bulletin.

11:58.205 --> 12:00.064
Reports from
all over the city indicate

12:00.408 --> 12:02.281
that machines are suddenly 
coming to life.

12:03.125 --> 12:04.703
Everything
from kitchen appliances

12:04.981 --> 12:07.496
to huge industrial machinery
is going berserk.

12:08.229 --> 12:10.180
There are riots in the streets.

12:10.461 --> 12:12.459
I suspect that this
is more of Shredder's doing.

12:12.852 --> 12:14.130
Well, whoever's behind it,

12:14.409 --> 12:15.689
I should be out there
covering the story.

12:16.065 --> 12:17.347
I'm a news reporter !

12:17.787 --> 12:18.551
Donatello,

12:18.813 --> 12:20.780
that fragment must be putting
out enough power now

12:21.045 --> 12:22.403
to get a reading on it.

12:22.780 --> 12:23.950
Negative.

12:24.261 --> 12:25.934
Now there's too much
power veing broadcast.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.209
I can't get a fix on the source.

12:28.553 --> 12:30.851
Then we'll just have
to hope we get lucky.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.380
Let's go, guys.

12:32.612 --> 12:33.473
Wait for me !

12:33.689 --> 12:35.187
I'm not missing this
story for anything !

12:37.187 --> 12:39.452
Excellent.
Excellent !

12:39.809 --> 12:41.921
Sooner or later, the turtles will come.

12:42.290 --> 12:44.336
We must protect
this building, o.m.n.s.s.

12:44.336 --> 12:45.696
Easily done.

12:54.325 --> 12:58.093
Where is April O'Neill ?!
Look at this.

12:58.324 --> 13:00.914
Machines are going wild
all over the city,

13:01.120 --> 13:02.851
and my star reporter is nowhere.

13:03.163 --> 13:04.635
April ?

13:05.582 --> 13:08.489
She's never around When
you need her, Mr. Thompson.

13:08.866 --> 13:11.108
Maybe you should give
the story to...

13:11.611 --> 13:13.686
someone more capable ?

13:14.172 --> 13:16.464
Well... that's not a bad idea.

13:16.806 --> 13:18.057
Why don't you take it ?

13:18.274 --> 13:19.542
You won't be sorry.

13:19.772 --> 13:21.072
But you might.

13:21.288 --> 13:22.867
It's a really dangerous assignment.

13:23.083 --> 13:25.350
Maybe you ought to check
out a bulletproof vest.

13:25.642 --> 13:30.032
Maybe we should let
April have it after all.

13:30.344 --> 13:32.198
Equal opportunity, and all that.

13:32.576 --> 13:35.104
I think i hear
my phone ringing. ciao.

13:36.195 --> 13:37.277
"Ciao."

13:37.757 --> 13:39.806
I've seen things with more 
backbone

13:40.254 --> 13:42.330
paddling around a tide pool.

13:42.782 --> 13:44.203
The tracker's not working.

13:44.409 --> 13:45.409
What are we gonna do ?

13:45.409 --> 13:47.623
Simple. We'll just ask
a toaster for directions.

13:47.890 --> 13:49.560
I've got a better idea.

13:55.554 --> 13:57.194
That thing will know.

13:57.441 --> 13:59.113
A robot meter maid ?

14:00.442 --> 14:02.660
Ok, lady. Tell us
where Shredder is.

14:03.124 --> 14:06.390
Go swallow a diode,
amphibian breath.

14:06.683 --> 14:09.200
Look, chips-for-brains,
we don't want

14:09.684 --> 14:12.381
but if you don't spill your circuits...

14:13.260 --> 14:16.335
Water and electricity
don't mix. Get it ?

14:16.626 --> 14:18.081
Oh, all right.

14:18.468 --> 14:19.670
I will interface.

14:22.673 --> 14:26.357
I have linked with nearly all
of the city's power plants now.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.444
Phase one of my plan

14:29.693 --> 14:30.645
is almost complete.

14:30.944 --> 14:33.723
As soon as O.M.N.S.S.
has absorbed enough power,

14:34.019 --> 14:35.749
it can open a portal to Dimension X

14:35.968 --> 14:37.577
and my army of foot soldiers

14:37.783 --> 14:39.297
without the help of Krang !

14:40.126 --> 14:42.858
Tracking mutant life form readings 
again.

14:43.151 --> 14:44.664
They're approaching this building !

14:45.070 --> 14:46.371
Destroy them !

14:51.379 --> 14:53.327
Wait, you're going the wrong way !

14:53.719 --> 14:55.830
I'm not !
The turtle van is.

14:56.121 --> 14:58.205
Shredder's got control of it.

14:58.485 --> 14:59.949
Bail out !

15:01.326 --> 15:03.055
No can do, bud.

15:03.648 --> 15:05.676
The doors just locked.

15:14.170 --> 15:15.683
Do something !

15:15.919 --> 15:17.667
I made plans for the weekend.

15:17.979 --> 15:19.633
The tracker.
It might work.

15:19.914 --> 15:21.180
Shrewd move, Donatello.

15:21.512 --> 15:24.053
If we ignore the problem,
it might go away by itself.

15:24.302 --> 15:26.595
There's a chance that
the tracker might short out

15:26.799 --> 15:28.156
whatever's controlling us.

15:34.494 --> 15:35.715
Hey, why the panic ?

15:36.023 --> 15:37.632
We had a whole
3 inches to spare.

15:38.387 --> 15:41.303
The turtles have short-circuited
my control of their vehicle !

15:41.706 --> 15:43.173
Never mind them.

15:43.486 --> 15:45.659
Concentrate on
absorbing enough power

15:45.864 --> 15:48.126
to open the portal
to Dimension X !

15:48.449 --> 15:49.732
M-m-master,

15:49.732 --> 15:51.183
are you sure that's wise ?

15:52.030 --> 15:53.651
Of course I'm sure !

15:54.007 --> 15:55.819
The turtles will never
reach us in time,

15:56.132 --> 15:58.616
Not with every machine
in the city against them.

16:00.066 --> 16:01.190
Do you have any idea

16:01.614 --> 16:03.187
just how Shredder's
causing this ?

16:03.686 --> 16:06.845
He's got to have some kind
of Artificial Intelligence

16:07.057 --> 16:08.870
Coordinating all these machines.

16:09.245 --> 16:10.618
As I was saying,

16:10.917 --> 16:13.553
He's probably got the fragment
hooked up to a computer.

16:14.397 --> 16:17.205
That means all we have to do
is get to the computer

16:17.442 --> 16:19.284
and take out the fragment.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.797
Oh, that's all ?
And for a minute there,

16:21.797 --> 16:23.449
I thought this was
gonna be tough !

16:35.188 --> 16:37.033
In less than half an hour,

16:37.281 --> 16:39.093
the portal will be open !

16:39.419 --> 16:43.213
Have you taken care
of the turtles ?

16:43.563 --> 16:45.492
I assure you
they are being dealt with.

16:45.823 --> 16:48.492
<i>Warning, warning ! Danger !</i>

16:48.724 --> 16:49.957
<i>Building security has been breach.</i>

16:50.174 --> 16:52.783
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

16:57.333 --> 16:58.549
<i>The turtles !</i>

16:58.781 --> 17:00.296
I don't know
how they got this far,

17:00.498 --> 17:01.903
but they won't get any farther !

17:02.308 --> 17:04.742
Activate all internal defense systems !

17:05.421 --> 17:07.055
It says we're getting close.

17:07.431 --> 17:08.646
Eyes open, turtles.

17:09.117 --> 17:10.425
If i know Shredder,

17:10.646 --> 17:13.268
he's got a few more tricks
up his pointed sleeve.

17:13.612 --> 17:15.939
And, like, here come a bunch 
of 'em now !

17:22.885 --> 17:24.771
Sorry !
No turtle waxing today.

17:30.991 --> 17:33.270
All right !
We really wiped the floor

17:33.581 --> 17:35.591
with those floor-wipers, huh ?

17:38.089 --> 17:38.962
Oh, you fools.

17:39.307 --> 17:40.695
It won't be that easy !

17:47.612 --> 17:49.283
Tubuloso curl !

17:49.631 --> 17:51.295
Cowabunga !

17:51.779 --> 17:58.352
You'll never reach me in time, turtles.

17:59.229 --> 18:02.519
In 10 minutes, O.M.N.S.S. will
open a portal to Dimension X

18:02.915 --> 18:05.157
and then, it's all over.

18:05.599 --> 18:08.188
Michelangelo,
cool that guy out, will ya ?

18:09.216 --> 18:12.264
Mucho gusto, o fearless leader.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.990
Got to get past that fire hose.

18:18.305 --> 18:19.942
Donatello, distract it.

18:23.563 --> 18:25.391
Oh, that's easy.
Watch this.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.026
Hey, Leonardo !

18:34.620 --> 18:37.177
just remember who stuck
his neck out for you.

18:40.895 --> 18:43.045
Time for a little turtle traction.

18:48.337 --> 18:49.355
You're kidding !

18:49.684 --> 18:51.615
It's 70 stories straight down !

18:51.932 --> 18:53.053
We're not going down.

18:53.270 --> 18:54.756
We're going up.

18:55.222 --> 18:57.254
And sooner than we thought.

19:03.401 --> 19:06.688
I knew i was gonna regret
coming with you guys.

19:07.043 --> 19:09.167
One minute
to dimensional opening.

19:11.789 --> 19:13.616
The turtles !

19:15.518 --> 19:17.375
Warning ! Warning !

19:17.812 --> 19:20.871
Insufficient power
to complete mission.

19:24.960 --> 19:28.115
You haven't won yet, turtles !

19:31.174 --> 19:32.331
Boy ! If it isn't one thing,

19:32.582 --> 19:34.127
it's a whole lot of things.

19:35.357 --> 19:37.499
That's it, April.
You'd better take cover.

19:38.042 --> 19:39.542
Yeah, this could get messy.

19:47.223 --> 19:48.970
What ?!

19:50.032 --> 19:52.624
All right, chump.
It's payback time.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.856
Turtles fight with honor !

19:56.449 --> 19:57.776
Yeah, let's rock, dudes !

19:58.663 --> 20:00.133
Master, do something !

20:01.333 --> 20:02.789
This will hold them.

20:07.220 --> 20:10.201
Perhaps another time, turtles.

20:11.658 --> 20:14.621
Oh, what a bummer.
He got away.

20:14.837 --> 20:17.631
I wonder what made the
computer go dead like that.

20:17.881 --> 20:19.901
Yeah, and i wonder where April is.

20:20.473 --> 20:22.145
Is it safe to come out ?

20:22.378 --> 20:25.018
April ! Do you know what
happened to the computer ?

20:25.313 --> 20:27.466
Of course I do.
I just unplugged it.

20:27.873 --> 20:28.683
I like it.

20:28.919 --> 20:30.495
Simple, but effective.

20:32.758 --> 20:34.430
Blast those turtles !

20:34.898 --> 20:37.364
One of these days, Baxter...

20:39.023 --> 20:41.625
It's been several hours,

20:42.064 --> 20:43.547
and no word, Shredder.

20:43.857 --> 20:46.095
Care to explain why ?

20:46.481 --> 20:48.384
Sorry. Must be something wrong

20:48.620 --> 20:50.368
with the transdimensional linkup.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.022
I'll explain it to you later.

20:52.287 --> 20:53.867
Master, i could've fixed it.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.221
Baxter, shut up.

20:58.455 --> 21:00.236
We must be more alert.

21:00.733 --> 21:02.575
Shredder almost won what time.

21:03.046 --> 21:05.436
This is going to make
quite a news story.

21:05.649 --> 21:07.931
Yeah. And best of all,
you're alive to tell it.

21:08.290 --> 21:11.302
I'm just glad all the
machines are back to normal.

21:11.646 --> 21:15.131
Things were getting pretty hairy
there for a while, and i ju...

21:20.467 --> 21:22.307
Oh, another robot !

21:22.980 --> 21:24.729
Get ready.

21:26.929 --> 21:28.285
Hey, dudes.

21:28.489 --> 21:30.976
Scope out this neato
toy robot i found.

21:31.408 --> 21:32.897
Isn't it a blast ?

21:34.907 --> 21:36.860
Hey, what's with you guys ?

21:37.860 --> 21:39.453
Lighten up, will ya ?

21:39.947 --> 21:41.513
Guys ?
