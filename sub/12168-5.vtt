00:10.600 --> 00:11.800
Look familiar?

00:12.000 --> 00:12.920
No.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.400
Me either.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.520
I do not believe I have been to this planet before.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.360
There's no sign of any settlements,
or at least nothing recent.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.200
Other than the smoke from that camp fire.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.320
Oh,

00:26.360 --> 00:27.560
yes well,

00:27.840 --> 00:29.040
other than that.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.640
I'll land within a few hundred yards

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

00:48.000 --> 00:50.120
It's primitive, definitely primitive.

00:50.440 --> 00:52.440
Probably not even worth making contact.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.240
What is that smell?

00:58.920 --> 01:03.080
- It appears they left in a hurry.
- They're not used to friendlies coming out of the Gate.

01:05.640 --> 01:06.640
<i>What are you?</i>

01:07.160 --> 01:10.720
Oh my God, he's tasting it!
You don't know what that is.
That could be their laundry!

01:11.640 --> 01:12.720
Pretty good.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.600
Oh yes, good idea. And when you're finished
with their porridge, why don't we try their beds.

01:19.840 --> 01:20.840
Want some?

01:22.040 --> 01:24.640
- How good is it?
- Leave it be Goldilocks.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.240
<i>Take cover!</i>

01:42.960 --> 01:45.000
<i>What the hell's in those sling shots?</i>

01:49.920 --> 01:50.880
You alright?

01:51.080 --> 01:52.080
Fine!

01:55.720 --> 01:58.760
You know this is not
the way to make new friends!

02:00.800 --> 02:03.200
But we'll leave if you want us to!

02:05.480 --> 02:08.560
I'll take that as a yes.
Let's go back to the Jumper. Teyla you're on point.

02:08.680 --> 02:11.160
- I'll take the six. McKay help Ronan.
- Don't worry about me.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.920
I'm a worrier. Let the man give you a hand.

02:16.360 --> 02:17.480
Fire!

02:54.840 --> 02:56.880
Alright move, move!!

03:15.600 --> 03:17.880
- Everyone in one piece?
- Yeah, thanks to that ship.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.040
Be still.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.800
Yeah, I like their timing.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.240
- No kidding, you see that thing?
- Yeah, I saw that thing.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.600
<i>Unidentified ship.</i>

03:24.640 --> 03:29.240
<i>This is the security vessel Borus.
Follow us immediately and we will lead you to the city.</i>

03:29.640 --> 03:30.760
<i>Understood Borus.</i>

03:31.040 --> 03:32.640
<i>Thanks for the help back there.</i>

03:33.400 --> 03:35.720
That's how you make new friends.

04:53.730 --> 04:55.130
Welcome to Olesia.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.530
I am Marin.

04:56.610 --> 04:58.450
Lt Col. John Sheppard,

04:58.455 --> 05:00.855
Teyla Emmagan, Dr Rodney McKay,

05:00.860 --> 05:02.180
Ronon Dex.

05:02.930 --> 05:04.890
Please, follow me.

05:06.370 --> 05:10.170
I sent a security detachment as soon as
we detected your presence on the island.

05:10.210 --> 05:13.970
- The prisoners there can be quite hostile.
- Yeah, we definitely got off on the wrong foot.

05:14.010 --> 05:17.170
- Prisoners?
- Yes. The island is a penal colony.

05:17.210 --> 05:19.250
The prisoners usually don't cause much trouble,

05:19.370 --> 05:22.770
- as long as you don't try to land there.
- You could put up a sign.

05:23.250 --> 05:28.550
The stargate is on the island. Does this
not affect your ability to trade with other worlds?

05:28.670 --> 05:29.890
Yes of course.

05:29.970 --> 05:32.530
As a result we have needed to be
almost entirely self sufficient.

05:32.570 --> 05:34.170
Then why put a prison there?

05:34.250 --> 05:38.650
I believe the Magistrate is better suited to
answer these questions. He's very eager to meet you.

05:38.690 --> 05:41.730
<i>Your ship is a most intriguing design.</i>

05:41.770 --> 05:48.170
I must admit I'm surprised to find others
in this galaxy who's technology rivals our own.

05:48.210 --> 05:53.050
- Aside from the Wraith, I mean.
- It's funny. I was about to make the exact same comment.

05:53.090 --> 05:54.650
Where do you come from?

05:54.810 --> 05:56.610
Until recently,

05:57.130 --> 05:58.330
Atlantis.

05:58.370 --> 06:00.290
- The Ancestral city.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

06:00.330 --> 06:03.530
Unfortunately it was destroyed
by the Wraith a short time ago.

06:03.570 --> 06:05.090
How tragic.

06:05.290 --> 06:07.490
Yeah, we're pretty broken up about it.

06:07.530 --> 06:10.810
We are a part of a small group
of people that were able to escape.

06:10.850 --> 06:12.810
- How fortunate for you.
<i>- Yes, yes, yes, very fortunate.</i>

06:12.850 --> 06:17.730
Look, getting back to the technology thing. I'm just
curious. How have you been able to make such
advancements without the Wraith stepping in?

06:17.770 --> 06:21.330
The Wraith have chosen to leave us alone.

06:23.290 --> 06:24.330
Why?

06:24.730 --> 06:26.010
I don't know.

06:26.130 --> 06:27.610
They never come here?

06:27.770 --> 06:30.370
The Wraith have been here many times.

06:30.570 --> 06:35.010
But with the Ancestral ring on the island,
the Wraith have always been,

06:35.170 --> 06:39.690
how should I put this,
satiated with the prisoners living there.

06:40.090 --> 06:43.090
<i>The Wraith have no need to venture any further.</i>

06:43.130 --> 06:45.930
Well that would explain why you put the prison there.

06:46.210 --> 06:47.330
The island

06:47.570 --> 06:50.530
has been a penal colony for hundreds of years.

06:50.730 --> 06:54.170
<i>It's location there has benefited my people greatly.</i>

06:54.210 --> 06:56.570
- Not all your people.
<i>- I assure you.</i>

06:56.610 --> 06:59.610
Only the most violent criminals are sent there.

06:59.650 --> 07:00.650
As...

07:00.810 --> 07:02.170
you've discovered.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.250
- It's a good crime deterrent.
- Crime...

07:07.490 --> 07:11.250
is virtually non-existant on Olesia.

07:11.570 --> 07:15.970
Unlike the prisoners,
we pride ourselves on being a most hospitable

07:16.130 --> 07:18.090
and civilized people.

07:22.530 --> 07:26.210
This section of the city is
devoted to scientific research.

07:26.450 --> 07:33.410
Our scientists have recently attained success in
the enrichment of a fissionable, yet non radioactive,
material to be used in generating power to the city.

07:33.450 --> 07:37.450
Fissionable, yet non radioactive. Well that, that,
that, that, is that even possible? What kind of materials?

07:37.490 --> 07:38.810
It's an ore.

07:39.050 --> 07:45.410
They extract it from a mineral found on our planet.
It's quite volatile and yields great promise.
I'd be very happy to show you the laboratory.

07:45.450 --> 07:46.930
I'd be very happy to see it.

07:46.970 --> 07:48.850
I'd be very happy to go back to our ship.

07:48.970 --> 07:51.850
Our people are due to check in with us
in a little while over the radio.

07:52.050 --> 07:53.410
We'll have to get back within range.

07:53.450 --> 07:55.770
You can link with one of our radio relay stations.

07:55.810 --> 07:58.890
There should be enough power to reach
the island, if that's your concern.

07:58.930 --> 08:02.410
- So we'll be speaking privately?
- Of course!

08:08.250 --> 08:10.690
And you believe they might be willing
to share some of this mineral?

08:10.730 --> 08:15.026
<i>Well, they seem open to it. They don't getlmany trading opportunities coming through the Gate.</i>

08:15.061 --> 08:16.010
Sounds promising.

08:16.050 --> 08:20.850
There is however, the minor
moral hiccup of their form of capital punishment.

08:20.890 --> 08:23.170
<i>- I'm sorry.
- They have an island.</i>

08:23.210 --> 08:25.970
It's their own version of Alcatraz,
where they send the worst criminals.

08:26.090 --> 08:28.490
<i>And the Gate is on the island so...</i>

08:28.530 --> 08:30.930
So the Wraith feed on the prisoners.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.090
<i>Yep.</i>

08:32.250 --> 08:34.250
Talk about cruel and unusual punishment.

08:34.289 --> 08:37.929
I prefer lethal injection, although I do
have a certain fondness for the electric chair.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.455
Call me romantic.

08:40.049 --> 08:42.929
The Wraith get what they want
and the Olesians get left alone.

08:42.970 --> 08:44.370
I'm surprised it works.

08:44.890 --> 08:51.490
He did however say
that only the most violent criminals get sent there
and that it has been this way for hundreds of years.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.890
Do you kill all of your violent criminals, on Earth?

08:53.930 --> 08:56.370
Certain countries. Yes.

08:56.450 --> 08:58.410
Do we need to get into this right now?

08:58.450 --> 09:01.130
<i>Well we do if we plan
on doing business with these people.</i>

09:01.170 --> 09:04.210
I wanna know more before I jump to any conclusions.

09:07.170 --> 09:10.290
- We were able to speak with our people. Thank you.
-  Of course!

09:10.410 --> 09:14.410
If you're open to it, we'd like
to discuss possible trade opportunities.

09:14.450 --> 09:16.090
We are very open.

09:16.250 --> 09:18.930
I'm sure that there is much that
we can learn from each other.

09:18.970 --> 09:23.650
Well, Doctor Elizabeth Weir will be the one to begin
official negotiations with you. That's really her thing.

09:23.690 --> 09:25.530
I'm looking forward to meeting her,

09:25.770 --> 09:26.890
and the start

09:26.930 --> 09:29.250
of a promising friendship.

09:34.810 --> 09:35.650
<i>Seriously.</i>

09:35.690 --> 09:40.130
<i>- Aren't you a little creeped out by that guy?</i>
- They're politician's Rodney. They're all creepy.

09:48.650 --> 09:50.130
Prepare to fire?

09:53.610 --> 09:55.450
Margaret Thatcher wasn't creepy.

09:55.490 --> 09:56.930
Although, maybe a little.

09:56.970 --> 10:02.970
She resembled an Aunt of mine.
Same hairstyle, facial structure.
Only my Aunt was much taller and remarkably hirsute.

10:03.010 --> 10:05.650
Oddest thing. She had to shave twice a day.

10:05.690 --> 10:06.890
Fire!!

10:11.290 --> 10:12.170
What was that?

10:13.690 --> 10:15.130
- They're shooting at us.
- The prisoners?

10:15.170 --> 10:16.890
- With what?
- Cloak the ship.

10:17.970 --> 10:20.450
I can't, we took some damage.
We'll be lucky to make it to the Gate.

10:20.490 --> 10:22.970
- How close are we?
- Close enough to dial.

10:29.810 --> 10:32.490
- That was close.
- Get ready to send an IDC.

10:36.650 --> 10:38.890
I've lost control systems, hang on!

10:45.210 --> 10:46.850
Have at them!!

11:12.370 --> 11:14.010
- Are you alright?
- I think I chipped a tooth.

11:14.050 --> 11:17.050
Did I chip a tooth? Cos I'm bleeding.
Cos I'm a high risk for endocarditus.

11:18.290 --> 11:19.170
John.

11:19.610 --> 11:20.930
That was...

11:21.370 --> 11:23.970
not one of my better landings. Sorry.

11:24.090 --> 11:26.490
The Gate should still be active for a few minutes.

11:26.850 --> 11:27.970
Alright,

11:28.330 --> 11:29.450
let's go.

11:55.570 --> 11:56.570
Hi folks.

11:57.890 --> 12:00.370
I hope I didn't crash land on anybody.

12:50.930 --> 12:53.730
You should know our people are expecting us.

12:53.770 --> 12:56.970
If we don't show up soon,
they'll come looking for us.

12:57.570 --> 12:59.330
Is that supposed to concern me?

12:59.410 --> 13:01.770
Don't go getting all full of yourself, Chief.

13:02.090 --> 13:06.290
A few canons are no match for the kind
of fire power they'll be bringing with them.

13:06.690 --> 13:07.690
Although,

13:08.090 --> 13:10.570
I should compliment whoever took that first shot.

13:10.610 --> 13:13.170
- It was a good one.
- Yeah, it was nice wasn't it?

13:13.490 --> 13:14.810
What do you want from us?

13:14.850 --> 13:17.610
Well, we've already got your weapons,

13:17.730 --> 13:19.490
<i>now I do believe we'll take your ship.</i>

13:19.810 --> 13:23.890
See, we had been planning a little trip
to the mainland, but after seeing you
fly that thing through the Ancestral ring.

13:23.930 --> 13:26.250
You're referring to the ship you just shot down!

13:26.290 --> 13:29.010
One that doesn't stand
a hope in hell of every flying again!

13:29.050 --> 13:30.970
The ship that you're gonna fix, yes.

13:31.170 --> 13:33.770
What am I, MacGyver?
Fix it with what?

13:35.570 --> 13:36.730
Get him up.

13:39.610 --> 13:42.490
You seem like a smart man.
I'm sure you'll think of something.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.490
Maybe all you need is a little motivation.

13:52.970 --> 13:55.650
Maybe you should think about fixing it Rodney.

13:59.770 --> 14:00.770
Good idea.

14:00.810 --> 14:03.970
My friends all tell me
I have a remarkable gift for persuasion.

14:10.330 --> 14:11.290
What happened?

14:11.570 --> 14:13.410
Gate activated. Nothing came through.

14:13.450 --> 14:15.290
- Colonel Sheppard?
- So we assumed.

14:15.330 --> 14:16.730
We received no IDC.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.970
A few moments later, Gate shuts down.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.890
They should have returned by now.

14:22.130 --> 14:24.210
Dial the planet and try to establish a radio link.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.370
Yes ma'am.

14:26.970 --> 14:29.050
Major Lorne? This is Weir.

14:29.370 --> 14:30.370
<i>Go ahead.</i>

14:30.530 --> 14:35.410
I may have to go offworld to assist Colonel Sheppard.
I'd like you to assemble a team and
have a Puddle Jumper ready to go.

14:35.450 --> 14:36.570
<i>Yes Ma'am.</i>

14:53.930 --> 14:56.050
- Anyone having any luck?
- Not yet.

14:56.090 --> 14:57.770
These bindings are very secure.

14:57.810 --> 15:00.970
Well, leave it to convicts to know
the best way to tie people up.

15:01.010 --> 15:04.530
Well, eventually I will get free and
when I do, he's gonna pay for this.

15:04.570 --> 15:08.810
Well, listen to me. When you get free,
you get us free and we all get outta here.

15:08.850 --> 15:10.330
<i>Let him find out we're gone,</i>

15:10.370 --> 15:11.370
after

15:11.410 --> 15:13.730
- we're gone.
- You expect me to let them get away with this?

15:13.770 --> 15:15.970
- The operative words are get away.
- After I kill him.

15:16.010 --> 15:18.770
- That type of thinking will get US killed.
- Well if you would return fire!

15:18.810 --> 15:21.290
- The weapons systems were damaged!
- If you say so.

15:21.330 --> 15:25.490
I do say so and right now I'm saying knock it off.

15:27.170 --> 15:28.970
Is that an order, Sheppard?

15:30.730 --> 15:32.930
I am beat up, tied up

15:32.970 --> 15:36.290
and couldn't order a pizza right now if I wanted to.

15:36.330 --> 15:38.650
But if you need it to be, yeah!

15:38.690 --> 15:40.210
It's an order.

15:43.450 --> 15:44.490
OK.

15:50.570 --> 15:54.850
There is no power getting to any of these controls!
Do you understand? Look, nuthin'!

15:54.890 --> 15:55.650
Why not?

15:55.690 --> 15:58.650
Let me go out on a limb here and say maybe
it had something to do with the crash?

15:58.690 --> 16:01.770
Which of course begs the question,
how the hell did you get your hands on explosives?

16:01.890 --> 16:03.490
Eldon made them.

16:03.810 --> 16:07.930
He fashioned a composite out of minerals and
materials he found around the island.

16:07.970 --> 16:11.570
Crude yes, but effective.
We shot you down, didn't we?

16:11.610 --> 16:14.730
- Eldon. Who's Eldon?
- That would be me.

16:18.050 --> 16:18.930
You're a prisoner?

16:18.970 --> 16:22.210
- I was accused of killing one man.
And it was a case of mistaken identity.
<i>- He's a scientist.</i>

16:22.250 --> 16:25.490
Tell you what Eldon, you can tell him
your whole life story. Just help him fix the ship.

16:25.530 --> 16:29.970
Look, I don't know what you expect me to do.
I don't have any of the proper diagnostic tools,
not to mention the fact that...

16:30.530 --> 16:31.970
You'll figure it out.

16:32.290 --> 16:33.650
And if I don't?

16:35.010 --> 16:36.410
Well, I can kill ya.

16:36.730 --> 16:44.730
But you strike me as the type of man who,
despite being weak and cowardly on the outside, harbours
a strength of character he doesn't even know he has.

16:45.810 --> 16:48.050
I'm sorry. Was there a compliment in there?

16:48.490 --> 16:51.210
See, the way to motivate a man like you Mr McKay,

16:51.250 --> 16:53.050
is not to threaten your life,

16:53.290 --> 16:55.290
it is to threaten the lives of your friends.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.530
That's right.

16:58.130 --> 16:59.410
Fix the ship.

16:59.890 --> 17:02.810
Otherwise, they start dying one after another,

17:03.450 --> 17:05.089
until you change your mind.

17:05.210 --> 17:06.650
Or until they're all dead.

17:06.690 --> 17:08.329
I don't care.

17:24.369 --> 17:25.250
All set?

17:25.490 --> 17:26.530
<i>Ready to go.</i>

17:26.531 --> 17:29.431
<i>- Still no word from them?</i>
- Nothing

17:30.750 --> 17:33.310
- Don't worry, we'll find them.
- I was hoping to negotiate a trade agreement.

17:33.350 --> 17:36.110
Now I'm worry I'll have to negotiate their release.

17:36.150 --> 17:37.750
We don't know that.

17:41.230 --> 17:44.670
Dial the Gate,
but go to stealth mode the moment we're through.

18:07.590 --> 18:11.670
The technology on this ship
is far more advanced than the Olesian's.

18:11.710 --> 18:15.230
How ironic then to have been shot down
by the cast of Braveheart!

18:16.350 --> 18:18.670
I was surprised we were able to shoot you down.

18:18.710 --> 18:21.270
This is the old low tech
versus high tech argument, I suppose?

18:21.310 --> 18:23.430
We've been working on those weapons for years.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.030
Yes well, well done! Good for them...

18:25.070 --> 18:27.710
Now are you going to continue talking or...

18:29.550 --> 18:30.950
Thank you.

18:37.230 --> 18:38.990
Oh give me that!

18:39.270 --> 18:41.110
See, where did that come from?

19:06.070 --> 19:07.270
Those canons.

19:07.310 --> 19:09.390
- Your design?
- No, no, no, no.

19:09.870 --> 19:14.510
Well, I chose the material and
helped calculate trajectories.

19:16.150 --> 19:18.150
The ignition mechanisms

19:18.310 --> 19:20.390
and the fuses, of course.

19:20.790 --> 19:25.270
But most of my efforts
went into fashioning the explosive shots.

19:25.310 --> 19:26.510
Ah explosives.

19:26.710 --> 19:28.310
Is that how you killed the man?

19:28.990 --> 19:31.950
I didn't kill him.
I'm innocent, I don't belong here.

19:31.990 --> 19:32.790
Really?

19:32.830 --> 19:35.670
I wonder if there's ever been
a convicted felon who didn't claim he was innocent?

19:35.710 --> 19:40.030
I don't care if you don't believe me.
I just want off this island.

19:40.670 --> 19:41.870
Oh no.

19:44.710 --> 19:45.830
What is it?

19:46.510 --> 19:49.030
I assume there's no DHD beside the stargate?

19:49.190 --> 19:53.630
The Ancestral ring.
Is there some kind of dialling device that turns it on?

19:53.750 --> 19:55.390
No. Nothing.

19:55.670 --> 19:58.710
Oh, of course,
why give the prisoners such an obvious means of escape.

19:59.030 --> 20:00.230
What's wrong?

20:02.310 --> 20:04.870
The main power distribution conduit's been damaged.

20:04.990 --> 20:10.390
That effectively cuts all the power to primary systems.
Drive pods, cockpit controls, DHD.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.150
Can you fix it?

20:13.390 --> 20:14.790
Easily, if I had a replacement.

20:15.230 --> 20:17.550
Without one, you and
your friends aren't going anywhere.

20:17.590 --> 20:18.830
Neither are you.

20:19.390 --> 20:21.150
If you don't fix this ship,

20:21.190 --> 20:26.390
Torrell's gonna make sure you're the first
the Wraith find at the next culling.

20:36.830 --> 20:37.710
Choose.

20:39.130 --> 20:40.290
Choose what?

20:40.330 --> 20:42.130
Which one of them dies first...

20:43.050 --> 20:43.930
<i>Do it!</i>

20:46.090 --> 20:48.410
- I can't do that.
- Well then, I'll choose for you.

20:48.850 --> 20:51.730
Either way, one of them dies unless you
change your mind about fixing that ship.

20:51.770 --> 20:54.010
Well I'm sorry,
but there are some things beyond my capability.

20:54.050 --> 20:56.130
- I don't believe you.
- Well, I know it is hard to believe, but....

20:56.170 --> 20:59.970
- No I mean, I think you're lying.
- I'm not. It's broken. You don't understand, broken?

21:00.450 --> 21:02.130
I know your type.

21:02.170 --> 21:04.250
You whine and you complain

21:04.290 --> 21:07.850
and you see to it that your every task
is viewed as some impossible achievement.

21:07.890 --> 21:12.410
So that when you do succeed, your gargantuan
efforts are viewed as all the more heroic.

21:12.450 --> 21:14.610
<i>That may be true in some cases,
but this is not one of them.</i>

21:14.650 --> 21:16.850
You are asking me to do the impossible!

21:17.490 --> 21:19.610
Your friends lives are in your hands.

21:20.090 --> 21:22.090
I'll give you some time to choose.

21:39.930 --> 21:41.530
Listen to him, McKay.

21:41.535 --> 21:46.535
He's killed eleven people. Eight before he was
sent here and three since he's been on the island.

21:46.570 --> 21:47.770
So eleven...?

21:47.810 --> 21:51.090
You've got some catching up to do, don't you?
He's only killed one.

21:51.130 --> 21:52.650
Who him?

21:52.690 --> 21:55.010
I told you I'm here because of a mistake.

21:55.015 --> 21:57.615
I'm sure everyone here on this island says that.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.570
Well as a matter of fact, some of us are innocent.

22:00.610 --> 22:03.810
Only a few like Torrell are actual murderers.

22:03.850 --> 22:06.210
You mean they put all their criminals here?

22:06.250 --> 22:07.810
Regardless of the crimes they commit?

22:07.850 --> 22:10.650
Once, only the worst of the worst were sent in here.

22:10.690 --> 22:16.690
<i>But the punishment proved to be such a successful
deterrent, that crime rates in Olesia plummeted.</i>

22:16.730 --> 22:20.010
Which meant fewer and fewer prisoners.

22:20.610 --> 22:22.410
Less food for the Wraith.

22:22.450 --> 22:23.770
<i>Exactly.</i>

22:24.330 --> 22:26.250
So they lowered the bar.

22:30.410 --> 22:32.490
They have not returned to the planet?

22:32.530 --> 22:36.370
No, and we haven't been able
to establish radio contact with them either.

22:36.410 --> 22:38.210
They didn't return to the city.

22:38.311 --> 22:41.427
Perhaps they travelled through
the ring to another planet?

22:41.450 --> 22:43.050
No, they would have radioed first.

22:43.090 --> 22:45.130
Something must have happened on the island.

22:45.170 --> 22:47.330
I'll alert our security teams.
Have them begin a search.

22:47.370 --> 22:48.290
We'll join them.

22:48.330 --> 22:51.450
- I would advise against that.
- Would you?

22:52.650 --> 22:54.690
The island is extremely dangerous.

22:54.730 --> 22:56.730
Our ships are heavily armoured.

22:56.810 --> 23:00.170
We know the terrain as well as the prisoners tactics.

23:00.210 --> 23:03.610
- Don't worry, we'll find them.
- I hope you do Magistrate.

23:04.170 --> 23:05.690
For all our sakes.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.810
Of course.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.930
I think they're loosening.

23:22.810 --> 23:26.370
Take it easy Chewie.
You're gonna cut your damn hands off.

23:26.410 --> 23:29.690
The more we struggle, the tighter the bindings get.

23:45.730 --> 23:48.450
- You need something like this.
- What about the guards?

23:48.490 --> 23:50.010
They stepped away. No-one's watching.

23:50.050 --> 23:51.650
Will you help us?

23:51.690 --> 23:52.770
If you'll help me.

23:52.810 --> 23:53.730
How?

23:53.735 --> 23:56.255
Fix the ship.
Let me leave with you.

23:56.290 --> 23:58.450
Oh for God's sake!
How many times do I have to tell you?

23:58.490 --> 24:00.050
I know you can do it.

24:00.090 --> 24:03.170
I could see in your eyes when you were working.
You were holding something back from us.

24:03.210 --> 24:04.410
Rodney?

24:04.450 --> 24:06.210
Nobody could fix it.

24:06.250 --> 24:11.290
I don't care who you think I am,
or what you think you saw in my eyes,
but it is totally, completely impossible.

24:11.330 --> 24:14.410
- Torrell and his men are gonna return soon.
- He'll fix it!

24:14.450 --> 24:18.130
- I just said I couldn't!
- You really suck at lying, Rodney!

24:18.810 --> 24:20.090
We have a deal.

24:24.410 --> 24:27.610
- There is one SLIGHT possibility.
- See?

24:27.650 --> 24:30.970
I won't actually be able to fix
the ship to fly out of here, but I might be able to...

24:31.010 --> 24:33.490
cobble together enough power from
the secondary systems to activate the DHD.

24:33.530 --> 24:35.810
That way we could dial the Gate and leave on foot.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.370
<i>When I say might, I mean probably not.</i>

24:37.410 --> 24:40.530
It's a long shot at best.
I'd have to bypass the main power distribut...

24:40.570 --> 24:42.250
Get us outta here!

24:45.610 --> 24:46.690
What are you doing?

24:46.730 --> 24:49.530
Give me one reason why I shouldn't cut your throat!

24:50.410 --> 24:52.410
For one, it would make a mess.

24:53.330 --> 24:54.090
<i>Look,</i>

24:54.130 --> 24:55.690
we made a deal.

24:55.970 --> 24:57.450
Just let him go.

25:09.650 --> 25:10.650
Careful!

25:10.850 --> 25:12.050
<i>Suck it up!</i>

25:38.170 --> 25:39.530
Why are we stopping?

25:39.570 --> 25:41.930
This is way too easy.

25:41.970 --> 25:43.570
Alright, stay close

25:43.575 --> 25:45.415
and stay quiet.

25:46.010 --> 25:46.730
What?

25:46.770 --> 25:48.450
Why does he say that to me?

26:05.370 --> 26:07.850
I didn't know anything about this,
I swear.

26:08.050 --> 26:10.090
We'll never be able to make it to the Jumper.
They have our weapons!

26:10.130 --> 26:11.050
We don't need weapons.

26:11.090 --> 26:12.850
What about the fact
that they seriously outnumber us?

26:12.890 --> 26:15.490
At least we got the element of surprise.

26:15.970 --> 26:18.490
I was beginning to think you were afraid to fight.

26:18.530 --> 26:22.050
No. I'm just naturally lazy,
but I will if I have to,

26:22.450 --> 26:24.450
and it's starting to look like we have to.

26:26.050 --> 26:28.050
How much time do you
need to rework the DHD?

26:28.090 --> 26:29.690
Well in a perfect world, two days.

26:29.730 --> 26:32.930
- Rodney!
- Right now... ten minutes give or take.

26:32.970 --> 26:36.010
<i>Alright, we need to create a diversion.
We're gonna split up and flank them.</i>

26:36.050 --> 26:40.650
Get them looking everywhere except the Jumper.
Hopefully we can buy enough time
to steal back our weapons.

26:42.890 --> 26:45.490
- Or we can just dial the Gate?
- They fixed the DHD?

26:45.530 --> 26:48.930
- That's impossible.
- I don't think they're the one's who dialled it.

26:51.810 --> 26:52.850
Get down!

26:56.090 --> 26:58.410
- It didn't see us.
<i>- If it saw us, it didn't care.</i>

26:58.450 --> 27:01.650
<i>- Why not?</i>
- Who cares, they left the Jumper.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.610
I'm afraid the news is not good.

27:04.650 --> 27:09.330
Our rescue teams had just begun the search
on the island, when the Ancestral ring activated.

27:09.370 --> 27:10.450
The Wraith?

27:10.730 --> 27:13.010
It appears a culling is underway.

27:13.410 --> 27:16.930
We're not sure how many ships are involved,
but our teams were forced to fall back.

27:16.970 --> 27:20.730
I'm not giving up hope.
I'll send teams back in the moment the Wraith are gone.

27:20.770 --> 27:24.850
Hopefully, your friends will have evaded the culling.
I must attend to this.

27:40.090 --> 27:45.290
I apologize for my tardiness.
I had an urgent matter to attend to.

27:45.295 --> 27:48.895
A matter which could ultimately benefit us both.

27:48.930 --> 27:50.610
In that case,

27:53.530 --> 27:55.450
apology accepted.

28:02.530 --> 28:06.010
I think this is my favourite vintage yet.

28:06.050 --> 28:10.690
I hope you find the food acceptable as well.
My new Chef is quite accomplished.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.090
I certainly hope so.

28:12.130 --> 28:19.730
Your previous chef unfortunately proved to be
far more appetizing than the meals he prepared.

28:25.930 --> 28:27.530
<i>I must admit,</i>

28:27.535 --> 28:31.375
I still find it intriguing
to watch you eat actual food.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.810
Our lineage may have diverged,

28:33.890 --> 28:37.010
but there are those of us who still retain

28:37.050 --> 28:40.250
an appreciation for finer things.

28:42.170 --> 28:50.570
And although it may provide moments
of pleasure, it does not sustain me.

28:51.370 --> 28:54.170
This arrangement I have made

28:54.210 --> 28:59.050
with you and your predecessors,
has served both of us well.

28:59.330 --> 29:05.650
<i>While others of my kind have been
forced to sleep between cullings,</i>

29:05.690 --> 29:12.370
I have enjoyed a steady stream
of humans for my consumption.

29:12.410 --> 29:17.530
And the taste of their defiance is sweet.

29:17.570 --> 29:20.610
You in return have been allowed to live in peace.

29:20.615 --> 29:21.615
And we thank you for that.

29:21.620 --> 29:30.620
But throughout the galaxy, hives continue
to wake in far greater numbers than are sustainable

29:30.650 --> 29:34.770
and with a hunger that is most pressing.

29:34.810 --> 29:40.130
I assure you that I have put measures in place
to augment the population on the island.

29:40.170 --> 29:44.010
Then why is it there are
even fewer inhabitants on the island?

29:44.050 --> 29:49.770
My kind would have destroyed your entire planet,

29:50.210 --> 29:53.990
but I am more civilized than that.

29:54.030 --> 29:56.090
- Thank you for your generosity.
<i>- Still,</i>

29:56.630 --> 29:59.830
there are interests which must be served.

29:59.870 --> 30:02.470
<i>There are many Wraith who hunger</i>

30:02.510 --> 30:05.950
and I have promised to provide for them.

30:05.990 --> 30:09.990
<i>The decision you are now faced with is,</i>

30:10.030 --> 30:13.150
on whom shall we feed?

30:13.670 --> 30:15.670
Your needs shall be met.

30:15.910 --> 30:17.990
You have my promise.

30:18.390 --> 30:19.590
Good.

30:20.030 --> 30:23.630
I would hate to see anything happen to you.

30:24.950 --> 30:28.750
I do so enjoy our dinners together.

30:35.550 --> 30:37.390
The Dart went back through the Gate.

30:37.430 --> 30:40.030
- Do you not know why it did not cull anyone?
- Maybe he did.

30:40.070 --> 30:42.750
He headed for the mainland when he first came through.

30:42.950 --> 30:44.870
Alright, keep watch.

30:45.950 --> 30:47.230
How's it coming Rodney?

30:47.270 --> 30:49.990
Slower than I expected,
but faster than humanly possible!

30:50.030 --> 30:53.150
Any chance of getting
the cloaking generator powered up too?

30:53.190 --> 30:55.550
Could really come in handy right about now.

30:55.590 --> 30:58.350
OK and how about have a snack?
Maybe you'd like me to make you a nice sandwich?

30:58.390 --> 30:59.910
Only if it's humanly possible.

30:59.950 --> 31:06.030
It'll be a miracle if I get the DHD back online,
let alone the cloaking generator. If I can
manage that, the power will be intermittent at best.

31:07.590 --> 31:08.870
OK, well,

31:08.950 --> 31:13.830
FYI the Wraith have all gone. So it's just
a matter of time before Torrell and his boys return

31:13.870 --> 31:15.950
with all of our weapons!

31:15.990 --> 31:16.870
I get it!

31:16.910 --> 31:18.710
Good!

31:26.710 --> 31:28.070
Marin?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.390
What's happened?

31:32.430 --> 31:34.550
No-one must know I'm speaking to you.

31:34.590 --> 31:35.390
Of course.

31:35.430 --> 31:38.390
You should leave as soon as possible.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.190
Why?

31:40.750 --> 31:44.870
The Magistrate has just rescinded my orders
to send rescue teams back to the island.

31:44.910 --> 31:46.030
What?

31:46.035 --> 31:48.235
Why would he do that?

31:48.830 --> 31:51.230
Several arrests have been made.

31:51.235 --> 31:57.275
Many people in the city have been apprehended
for unspecified violations, to be sent to the island
to increase the population there.

31:57.310 --> 31:58.990
To keep the Wraith fed.

31:59.030 --> 32:02.230
This has been going on for some time,
but never so bad as this.

32:02.270 --> 32:04.270
The number of arrests is...

32:04.310 --> 32:07.070
I cannot keep quiet any longer,
I have to speak out!

32:07.110 --> 32:08.230
<i>Lies!</i>

32:10.510 --> 32:15.190
Seeding fear not only among our own people,
but now our guests?

32:15.230 --> 32:16.750
I cannot allow it.

32:16.790 --> 32:20.310
I was only trying to understand
why so many people are being arrested.

32:20.350 --> 32:24.750
Your job is not to question
the actions of this government.

32:25.470 --> 32:27.110
No! Wait!

32:27.150 --> 32:28.750
Help me, please!

32:28.790 --> 32:31.630
- Where are they taking her?
- I'm sorry, you had to witness that.

32:31.670 --> 32:33.790
What crime has she committed?

32:34.590 --> 32:36.510
I have recently learned that Marin

32:36.550 --> 32:40.070
has been involved in a group seeking
to undermine the Olesian Government.

32:40.110 --> 32:44.430
She has become very adept at spinning lies
to suit her organization's treasonable agenda.

32:44.470 --> 32:48.670
Did you or did you not rescind the order
to send rescue teams back to the island?

32:48.710 --> 32:49.470
Why would I do that?

32:49.510 --> 32:53.870
That doesn't concern me. My first concern is
with the safety of my people and I promise you, if...

32:53.910 --> 33:02.910
Everything is being done to ensure
their rescue and safe return. If there has been
any hindrance at all, it was because of Marin.

33:02.950 --> 33:04.950
What's going to happen to her now?

33:04.990 --> 33:07.590
She'll receive a fair trial in our courts.

33:07.630 --> 33:09.910
And then what?
Sent to the island?

33:09.950 --> 33:11.790
I'm sure where you come from,

33:11.830 --> 33:14.830
treason is also considered a very serious offence.

33:15.230 --> 33:16.750
So that's a yes.

33:17.630 --> 33:21.270
Tell me, what else is considered
a serious offence around here?

33:21.310 --> 33:22.430
Anything

33:22.910 --> 33:25.510
that threatens the welfare of the Olesian people.

33:25.550 --> 33:28.510
Are you sure it's the welfare
of the people that concerns you?

33:28.550 --> 33:30.390
Or just your own?

33:30.430 --> 33:33.230
Choose your words very carefully Dr Weir.

33:33.270 --> 33:34.550
Oh I do.

33:34.910 --> 33:37.070
Why, is that a threat?

33:37.110 --> 33:38.390
It's advice.

33:40.110 --> 33:42.310
From one ally to another.

33:42.950 --> 33:44.790
Well this alliance,

33:44.795 --> 33:47.035
it's just been rescinded.

33:47.070 --> 33:48.350
We're leaving!

33:50.230 --> 33:51.230
What,

33:51.235 --> 33:53.555
you plan to arrest us too?

33:58.270 --> 34:01.470
Because you do not wanna do that!

34:24.790 --> 34:25.989
The party's over

34:26.409 --> 34:28.810
And we were having such a good time.

34:33.810 --> 34:36.290
Alright, let's see if we can hold them off.

34:37.690 --> 34:40.730
As soon as you get the DHD back online,
dial the Gate and make a run for it.

34:40.770 --> 34:44.425
When you get back to Atlantis, start working
on those sandwiches, we'll be right behind you.

34:44.429 --> 34:45.489
Two minutes!

34:45.510 --> 34:48.090
Hold on that long and we're good to go!

35:41.840 --> 35:43.000
<i>Don't move!</i>

35:56.570 --> 35:59.130
That's it! I did it! We're ready to go!

36:01.530 --> 36:02.690
You see that?

36:02.730 --> 36:05.010
I knew you could do it.

36:10.870 --> 36:11.910
Oh no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

36:11.950 --> 36:12.910
You don't have to do that!

36:12.950 --> 36:17.550
Look, if you want me to dial the Gate for you,
that's fine. I... There are hundreds of
suitable planets out there you can go to.

36:17.710 --> 36:22.430
But, there are hundreds of unsuitable
planets you can send me to, aren't there?

36:22.470 --> 36:24.710
Yeah but, I won't, I won't send you to one of those.

36:24.750 --> 36:28.350
I think our best option is
to just come with you to your planet.

36:29.350 --> 36:32.430
Provided you got more of
these laying around there. Do ya?

36:32.470 --> 36:33.790
Forget it.

36:33.990 --> 36:35.430
I'm sorry.

36:35.710 --> 36:38.270
We'll dial you another address,
you can go through, but

36:38.310 --> 36:40.310
we're not taking you home.

36:42.110 --> 36:45.670
You are aware of the fact that
we have a lot of weapons pointed at you, right?

36:45.710 --> 36:50.470
Yeah, well you're gonna murder us
the minute we step through the Gate anyway,
so what difference does it make?

36:50.510 --> 36:52.310
That's very distrustful.

36:54.670 --> 36:55.790
<i>Wait! Look!</i>

36:55.870 --> 36:56.870
Oh no.

37:15.910 --> 37:20.670
We've got a Wraith cruiser headed for the island
and I'm picking up several more on approach
outside the atmosphere.

37:20.710 --> 37:23.990
Go to stealth mode.
Let's find our guys, before they do.

37:30.390 --> 37:31.470
What is that?

37:31.670 --> 37:32.510
What is that?

37:32.550 --> 37:36.350
It's a Wraith cruiser and trust me,
you don't wanna be around when it get's here.

37:41.070 --> 37:42.030
Come on.

37:43.230 --> 37:44.830
- Wait! Wait!
-  Come on.

37:44.835 --> 37:46.515
Dial the Gate.

37:47.630 --> 37:48.390
Stop!

37:48.430 --> 37:52.030
If all the prisoners get off this island,
where do you think that ship will go?

37:57.390 --> 38:02.310
What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
We got a big problem in here!

38:04.910 --> 38:05.470
What's up?

38:05.510 --> 38:07.070
- I lost power to the DHD.
- Why ?

38:07.110 --> 38:10.870
I told you power would be intermittent at best!
We should have dialed immediately when it patched in,
instead of standing around and talking!

38:10.910 --> 38:12.110
<i>- Can you fix it?
- I don't know!</i>

38:12.150 --> 38:14.150
- They're right on top of us.
- Look, we could shoot them down.

38:14.190 --> 38:17.110
Neither your weapons nor ours will damage it.

38:17.150 --> 38:19.030
What about the drones?
Can you patch enough power to arm them?

38:19.070 --> 38:20.590
They're not as intricate as the DHD.

38:20.630 --> 38:22.910
- Maybe, maybe, maybe one, given the time contraints!
- Then do it.

38:22.950 --> 38:24.710
Can one drone shoot down an entire Wraith cruiser?

38:24.750 --> 38:28.910
- Maybe we'll get a lucky shot. McKay?
- Almost! Just give me one more....

38:28.950 --> 38:31.750
OK we're on, go before the power cuts out again!

38:40.070 --> 38:41.630
- See that?
- A drone.

38:41.670 --> 38:43.670
- We scored a hit!
- Great.

38:43.710 --> 38:45.270
That's either going to buy us time
or piss them off.

38:45.310 --> 38:47.190
But we don't know what the ship's gonna do now.

38:47.230 --> 38:53.630
<i>Colonel Sheppard? You've damaged the Wraith
cruiser and it's leaving the area, but there are
two more cruisers incoming.</i>

39:00.510 --> 39:01.910
Elizabeth, where are you?

39:02.790 --> 39:04.870
We're in Jumper two, we're cloaked,
directly above you.

39:04.910 --> 39:05.830
<i>You alright?</i>

39:05.870 --> 39:07.230
Our Jumper's disabled.

39:07.270 --> 39:11.750
Right now, I need you to dial the Gate
to one of the back up planets to the Alpha site.
Doesn't matter which one.

39:11.790 --> 39:14.110
Understood.
Do it.

39:17.790 --> 39:22.230
OK, everyone who wanted off this planet,
now's your chance!

39:22.270 --> 39:23.430
Time to go.

39:23.470 --> 39:25.230
And why should we trust you...

39:25.270 --> 39:27.470
You wanna stay here, stay. I really don't give a damn!

39:27.510 --> 39:30.350
But you are not coming home with us!

39:30.355 --> 39:30.875
But...

39:30.910 --> 39:32.830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can come.

39:46.630 --> 39:47.630
Elizabeth?

39:47.670 --> 39:52.510
<i>I need you to keep the Gate open till the last of
them go through, then shut it down, dial Atlantis!</i>

39:52.550 --> 39:53.950
<i>We could land and pick you up.</i>

39:53.990 --> 39:56.910
Negative!
Just keep the Gate open, we'll take it from there.

39:56.950 --> 39:59.230
<i>Stay in stealth mode
until the Wraith have gone away.</i>

39:59.270 --> 40:00.550
Acknowledged.

40:13.570 --> 40:15.690
Here comes another Cruiser.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.770
Dial Atlantis.

40:18.570 --> 40:20.370
We're dialing, head for the Gate.

40:45.410 --> 40:46.850
They're through.
