WEBVTT

00:02.572 --> 00:04.074
Come on, Carl, step on it.

00:04.075 --> 00:05.742
Drive on the sidewalk
if you have to.

00:05.743 --> 00:08.077
Hey, I'm your partner...
I will get us there.

00:08.079 --> 00:10.113
But you should have just
used the bathroom at Abe's.

00:10.114 --> 00:12.482
I like going at my mom's house.

00:12.483 --> 00:13.917
She's at work, and it's quiet.

00:13.918 --> 00:15.452
Plus, I grew up
with that toilet.

00:15.453 --> 00:17.120
We know each other's secrets.

00:17.121 --> 00:18.755
Easy, easy!

00:18.756 --> 00:20.457
Stay with me, buddy.
We're almost there.

00:20.458 --> 00:22.125
Carl, I'm not gonna make it.

00:22.126 --> 00:23.726
Hey, d-don't you
let go on me, man!

00:23.727 --> 00:25.695
Don't you let go on me!

00:25.696 --> 00:27.863
(siren wailing)

00:29.532 --> 00:31.700
(toilet flushes)

00:33.503 --> 00:35.037
(screams)

00:35.772 --> 00:37.873
Mom, what are you doing home?

00:37.875 --> 00:38.875
I live here.

00:38.876 --> 00:40.443
What the hell are you doing?

00:40.444 --> 00:42.178
I came to borrow
your <i> Better Homes & Gardens.</i>

00:42.179 --> 00:44.480
What do you think?

00:44.481 --> 00:47.116
So you're the one who's been
Goldilocks-ing around my house

00:47.117 --> 00:48.451
while I've been at work.

00:48.452 --> 00:50.420
You know, if you're gonna nap
in somebody's bed,

00:50.421 --> 00:52.321
you need to make it
when you're done.

00:52.322 --> 00:53.790
I tried.

00:53.791 --> 00:55.790
You know I can't get
the corners as tight as you.

00:55.792 --> 00:57.659
No one can.

00:58.928 --> 01:01.030
Wait, what are you
doing home anyway?

01:01.031 --> 01:02.298
Shouldn't you be at work?

01:02.299 --> 01:03.799
What, are you my parole officer?

01:03.800 --> 01:07.203
I got to keep you updated on
my whereabouts and my doings?

01:07.204 --> 01:09.071
What? I'm just asking.

01:09.072 --> 01:10.839
I retired, okay?

01:10.841 --> 01:12.240
Since when?

01:12.242 --> 01:14.510
Since I decided to stop working.

01:14.511 --> 01:16.078
All these years
in the cafeteria,

01:16.079 --> 01:17.580
you just woke up
one day and decided,

01:17.581 --> 01:19.582
"I've sloppied my last joe."

01:19.583 --> 01:20.616
Maybe I did.

01:20.617 --> 01:21.584
What's it to you?

01:21.585 --> 01:22.551
I don't know.

01:22.552 --> 01:24.119
Maybe I want to say
congratulations.

01:24.121 --> 01:25.588
There, you said it.

01:25.589 --> 01:27.989
Now, unless you're gonna give me
a gold watch, beat it.

01:27.991 --> 01:29.992
All right, all right, I'm going.

01:29.993 --> 01:31.993
Leave the <i>Homes & Gardens.</i>

01:31.995 --> 01:34.028
I'm sick of you stealing
my magazines.

01:34.030 --> 01:36.265
Sorry, "Dr. Izzian Lahiri."

01:36.266 --> 01:37.266
Yeah.

01:37.267 --> 01:39.068
Hey, he's not gonna read it.

01:39.069 --> 01:41.235
He can barely speak English.

01:43.372 --> 01:44.707
(door closes)

01:44.708 --> 01:47.909
I hate my home,
and I don't have a garden.

01:49.044 --> 01:50.446
(both scream)

01:50.447 --> 01:51.479
Oh.

01:51.481 --> 01:52.614
Hey, Mama Biggs.

01:52.615 --> 01:54.348

02:25.738 --> 02:28.374
It's funny... I never pictured
your mom as the retiring type.

02:28.375 --> 02:30.143
I always figured when
the time was right,

02:30.144 --> 02:32.978
someone would throw water on
her, and she'd just melt away.

02:34.247 --> 02:36.949
I know... she loved working
at the school cafeteria.

02:36.950 --> 02:39.818
And she could rock a hairnet.

02:39.820 --> 02:41.187
So how does she seem?

02:41.188 --> 02:42.488
I mean, is she excited?

02:42.489 --> 02:43.790
Is she making plans?

02:43.791 --> 02:45.158
Is she gonna travel?
(gasps)

02:45.159 --> 02:47.359
Ooh, maybe she'll move
to Florida.

02:48.561 --> 02:49.795
Yeah, well, if she does,

02:49.796 --> 02:51.230
it'll give those
old geezers in Boca

02:51.231 --> 02:52.898
something to bitch about
besides the humidity.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.667
So are you gonna
throw her a party?

02:55.669 --> 02:58.803
Molly, we don't know for sure
that she's moving to Florida.

02:58.805 --> 03:00.406
No.

03:00.407 --> 03:01.807
For... for the retirement.

03:01.808 --> 03:03.075
I mean, you're her son.

03:03.076 --> 03:04.609
Don't you think you should
plan something?

03:04.611 --> 03:06.012
I'm not good
at that kind of thing.

03:06.013 --> 03:07.278
Oh, it's easy.
You just...

03:07.280 --> 03:09.515
invite her friends from work,
you get a sheet cake,

03:09.516 --> 03:11.417
you sing her
"For She's a Jolly Good Fellow,"

03:11.418 --> 03:12.651
the monster's appeased,

03:12.652 --> 03:15.854
then the villagers are safe
until the next harvest.

03:15.856 --> 03:18.591
You know what,
a party is a great idea.

03:18.592 --> 03:19.592
Well, thank you.

03:19.593 --> 03:20.860
No. Thank you.

03:20.861 --> 03:22.760
You're gonna make my mother
very happy.

03:22.762 --> 03:24.163
Let me know if you need me
to pick up

03:24.164 --> 03:25.498
that cake that you order.

03:25.499 --> 03:26.832
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?

03:26.833 --> 03:28.666
You're a good daughter-in-law.

03:29.702 --> 03:31.237
What the hell just happened?

03:31.238 --> 03:33.972
You got duped by a dope.

03:41.213 --> 03:42.548
Surprise!

03:42.549 --> 03:43.715
Hey.

03:43.717 --> 03:45.017
If you're with the
health department,

03:45.018 --> 03:46.919
you need to give
us 48 hours notice.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.887
We know the law.

03:48.888 --> 03:51.857
No, it's Molly Flynn.

03:51.858 --> 03:53.859
I-I taught here for,
like, ten years.

03:53.860 --> 03:55.092
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

03:55.094 --> 03:56.128
Miss Flynn?

03:56.129 --> 03:57.095
Taught fourth grade?

03:57.096 --> 03:59.731
Teacher of the Year?

03:59.732 --> 04:02.300
Green salad with a scoop
of tuna on the side?

04:02.302 --> 04:04.369
Ah.
Oh, hey, honey.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.536
How you doing?

04:05.538 --> 04:06.705
Good, good.

04:06.706 --> 04:09.341
Uh, anyway, the reason
I'm here is

04:09.342 --> 04:11.776
because you are both invited
to a party.

04:11.778 --> 04:12.911
Oh, hey.
Ooh.

04:12.912 --> 04:14.378
Yeah, to celebrate
Peggy's retirement.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.413
(chuckles)

04:15.415 --> 04:17.749
Yay.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.784
Party.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.287
Is this some sort of joke?

04:22.288 --> 04:23.555
No, but it is a secret.

04:23.556 --> 04:25.323
So don't tell
the one-eyed janitor,

04:25.324 --> 04:27.758
(whispering):
'cause he's not invited.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.728
Look, tuna scoop,

04:29.729 --> 04:31.229
I don't know
what Peggy told you,

04:31.230 --> 04:33.031
but she didn't retire;
she got fired.

04:33.032 --> 04:34.866
What?
Yep.

04:34.867 --> 04:37.502
That woman was the worst person
I've ever had to deal with.

04:37.503 --> 04:40.738
And I used to work
the chow line at Joliet.

04:42.140 --> 04:43.441
When she started working here,

04:43.442 --> 04:46.276
she was warm, friendly,
just like us.

04:48.012 --> 04:50.515
But once she got promoted
to griddle master,

04:50.516 --> 04:52.616
the power went
straight to her head.

04:52.618 --> 04:54.318
Oh, I remember that.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.054
There was a couple months
where she insisted

04:56.055 --> 04:57.255
we call her "the Griddler."

04:57.256 --> 04:58.223
Ugh.

04:58.224 --> 05:00.158
She was horrible.

05:00.159 --> 05:03.194
She would peck away
at every minor flaw you had.

05:03.195 --> 05:05.563
Do you have any idea
what it's like to live

05:05.564 --> 05:07.165
under that kind of scrutiny?

05:07.166 --> 05:09.800
I married into
that kind of scrutiny.

05:09.802 --> 05:12.470
It became such a hostile
work environment,

05:12.471 --> 05:13.805
we went to the principal.

05:13.806 --> 05:14.871
She had to go.
Mmm.

05:14.873 --> 05:17.275
Your mother-in-law
learned a hard lesson

05:17.276 --> 05:19.243
about cafeteria life.

05:19.244 --> 05:22.813
Fly too high, and the
heat lamps gonna get ya.

05:25.249 --> 05:26.784
That's a good one.

05:26.785 --> 05:30.387
So it-it was time for her
to tapioca out of here.

05:33.057 --> 05:34.457
Yours was better.
Mmm.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.259
It was better.

05:37.828 --> 05:39.197
MOLLY: Mike!

05:39.198 --> 05:40.498
In here.

05:40.499 --> 05:42.365
Ooh, you better sit down.

05:43.868 --> 05:44.868
Okay.

05:44.870 --> 05:45.836
'Cause this is big.

05:45.837 --> 05:47.337
This is juicy.

05:47.339 --> 05:49.006
And I don't like throwing
around the word "bombshell,"

05:49.007 --> 05:50.874
but bombshell.

05:51.876 --> 05:53.376
Well, what is it?

05:53.378 --> 05:55.746
Okay, here we go.

05:55.747 --> 05:58.382
Your mom did not retire.

05:58.383 --> 06:00.417
She was fired.

06:00.418 --> 06:02.252
(imitates explosion)

06:06.857 --> 06:09.160
And...?

06:09.161 --> 06:10.127
And?

06:10.128 --> 06:11.629
Are you kidding me?

06:11.630 --> 06:12.963
Your mom was fired.

06:12.964 --> 06:14.564
She lied right to your face.

06:14.566 --> 06:16.099
Eh, she does that.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.869
That's it?

06:18.870 --> 06:20.037
That's all you're gonna give me?

06:20.038 --> 06:21.839
I'm sorry,
but this is nothing new.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.640
She spins every negative thing
in her life

06:23.641 --> 06:24.875
so it isn't her fault.

06:24.876 --> 06:26.110
But we don't call it lying.

06:26.111 --> 06:28.277
We call it "Mom's version."

06:30.047 --> 06:33.650
And in her defense, how else
is she gonna live with herself?

06:33.651 --> 06:35.619
Wait, n-n-no, we need to
confront her about this.

06:35.620 --> 06:37.120
I mean, by "we," I mean you,

06:37.121 --> 06:39.223
but I want to be there to watch.

06:39.224 --> 06:42.024
I am not confronting her.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.727
Uh, why not?

06:43.728 --> 06:45.028
Well, I don't know.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.063
Survival?

06:46.064 --> 06:47.130
Self-preservation?

06:47.131 --> 06:48.098
I'm scared of her?

06:48.099 --> 06:49.732
Take your pick.

06:49.734 --> 06:52.836
Well, I am not throwing
"Liar, liar,

06:52.837 --> 06:55.304
I didn't even retire" a party.

06:56.339 --> 06:57.707
Oh, yes, you are.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.576
As far as everyone's concerned,
she's retired.

06:59.577 --> 07:00.744
But it's not true.

07:00.745 --> 07:01.711
"But, but, but."

07:01.712 --> 07:03.679
The truth has no place here.

07:04.748 --> 07:06.449
But we will give
my mother that party,

07:06.450 --> 07:08.984
she will be ungrateful,
and we will move on.

07:09.786 --> 07:12.556
How did you survive
your childhood?

07:12.557 --> 07:13.657
What does it look like?

07:13.658 --> 07:15.591
Eating right and exercising.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:29.305 --> 07:31.573
This is a very nice party.

07:32.976 --> 07:35.110
Boy, you're easy to please.

07:35.979 --> 07:38.580
These canapés are
quite delightful.

07:38.582 --> 07:41.283
Did you need 12 of 'em
to decide that?

07:44.754 --> 07:47.522
So what are your plans now?

07:47.524 --> 07:49.825
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

07:49.827 --> 07:52.862
Well, we are
at your retirement party.

07:52.863 --> 07:55.764
But I guess we can just
sit here in silence.

07:56.766 --> 07:58.701
I'll never retire.

07:58.702 --> 08:01.803
Three weeks after my pop stopped
working, he dropped dead.

08:01.805 --> 08:05.875
He was hiking the Grand Canyon
and didn't bring any water.

08:05.876 --> 08:08.043
I guess what I'm saying is...
hydrate.

08:09.178 --> 08:11.280
I hate the taste of water.

08:11.281 --> 08:12.781
Of course you do.

08:14.584 --> 08:15.952
You should hear
your mom out there.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.486
I think she actually believes
she retired.

08:17.487 --> 08:18.486
Molly, I'm telling you,

08:18.488 --> 08:20.456
in her little world,
she is retired,

08:20.457 --> 08:22.558
her podiatrist
is in love with her,

08:22.559 --> 08:25.361
and Anderson Cooper isn't gay.

08:25.362 --> 08:27.329
I can't imagine deluding
myself like that.

08:27.330 --> 08:29.331
I have to live honestly.

08:29.332 --> 08:30.666
Oh, really?

08:30.667 --> 08:32.534
So you were born
with that hair color?

08:32.535 --> 08:34.102
Yes.

08:34.104 --> 08:35.638
I was. That's...

08:35.639 --> 08:38.039
why I keep trying
to get back to it.

08:38.041 --> 08:41.743
And, uh, y-you were the one who
came up with "talk to the hand."

08:41.745 --> 08:45.648
Maybe not "came up with it,"
but I brought it to Chicago.

08:45.649 --> 08:47.583
Molly, look, I'm just...

08:47.584 --> 08:49.250
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

08:50.586 --> 08:52.555
It's great that you retired

08:52.556 --> 08:54.689
while you're still able
to enjoy...

08:56.525 --> 08:59.027
I'm sorry, is there
anything you enjoy?

08:59.029 --> 09:03.365
I've only ever really had
one passion... cooking.

09:03.366 --> 09:05.100
In bulk.

09:05.101 --> 09:07.635
Well, if that's the case, you
sure lucked into the right son.

09:07.637 --> 09:09.570
What are we talking about?

09:09.572 --> 09:12.741
About how happy
you make your mom.

09:12.742 --> 09:14.042
Yeah, he's one in a million.

09:14.043 --> 09:15.978
Always come to visit
when I'm not at home,

09:15.979 --> 09:18.512
and always tests the plumbing.

09:19.681 --> 09:21.016
Hey, now with your mom
being around,

09:21.017 --> 09:22.851
when we go over there
for your little bathroom breaks,

09:22.852 --> 09:23.951
we can stay for lunch, too.

09:23.953 --> 09:25.387
No, no, I like my routine.

09:25.388 --> 09:26.722
I eat lunch at Abe's,

09:26.723 --> 09:28.757
and that greasy food
sends me to my mother's.

09:28.758 --> 09:30.025
If I eat at Mom's,

09:30.026 --> 09:32.661
who knows where I'll
be when the muse hits.

09:32.662 --> 09:34.362
Hey, do you think
what's-his-name needs

09:34.363 --> 09:35.630
any help down at that diner?

09:35.631 --> 09:37.966
Maybe you could put in
a good word for me.

09:37.967 --> 09:39.267
To work at Abe's?

09:39.268 --> 09:40.868
Uh, n-n-no, y-you don't
want to do that.

09:40.870 --> 09:42.637
Why not?

09:42.638 --> 09:44.639
Because, as your tiara says,
you're retired.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.641
Enjoy your golden years.

09:46.642 --> 09:47.943
At home.

09:47.944 --> 09:50.311
Away from people.

09:50.313 --> 09:53.848
I took 18 stitches pushing
your big head out my cervix,

09:53.849 --> 09:56.217
and you can't do
something nice for me?

09:56.218 --> 09:57.885
What do you call this?

09:57.887 --> 09:59.387
Boring.

09:59.388 --> 10:00.522
These are all your friends.

10:00.523 --> 10:01.556
Where are mine?

10:01.557 --> 10:02.691
That's a good question, Ma.

10:02.692 --> 10:03.757
Where are your friends?

10:03.759 --> 10:05.760
What are you saying?
Nothing.

10:05.761 --> 10:08.263
Let's just get through
this joyous occasion.

10:08.264 --> 10:09.264
You ingrate.

10:09.265 --> 10:10.397
After all I've done for you,

10:10.399 --> 10:12.333
you can't put in
a good word for me

10:12.334 --> 10:13.735
at that crappy diner?

10:13.736 --> 10:15.437
Oh, believe me, Ma,
if I could find a good word,

10:15.438 --> 10:16.403
I'd put it in.

10:16.405 --> 10:18.505
What is that supposed to mean?

10:18.507 --> 10:20.575
It means I don't want
to subject my friends

10:20.576 --> 10:21.742
to the Griddler, either.

10:21.744 --> 10:24.244
I know about the cafeteria.

10:24.246 --> 10:25.547
You got fired.

10:25.548 --> 10:27.115
As usual, you don't know squat.

10:27.116 --> 10:28.449
I retired.

10:28.450 --> 10:30.651
And if somebody tells you
different, they're liars.

10:30.653 --> 10:31.986
No!

10:31.987 --> 10:33.120
You're the liar!

10:33.122 --> 10:34.856
You always have been!

10:34.857 --> 10:37.558
You got fired because
you're bitter and toxic

10:37.559 --> 10:39.626
and nobody wants
to be around you.

10:41.028 --> 10:43.731
♪ For she's a jolly
good fellow ♪

10:43.732 --> 10:46.134
♪ For she's a jolly... ♪

10:46.135 --> 10:47.968
You and I are done.

10:52.340 --> 10:54.141
What happened?

10:54.142 --> 10:55.576
Mike just told off his mom.

10:55.577 --> 10:58.678
Oh, and I missed it?

11:09.137 --> 11:11.672
Let's not overdo it
with the coffee, Samuel.

11:11.673 --> 11:13.641
I don't know where
I'm landing after this lunch.

11:13.642 --> 11:15.009
Come on.

11:15.010 --> 11:16.543
Your mom's house is
right on our beat.

11:16.545 --> 11:17.545
Nope.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.980
That commode is dead to me.

11:19.982 --> 11:22.350
Ah, you should
appreciate your mother.

11:22.351 --> 11:23.951
Mine is 4,000 miles away,

11:23.952 --> 11:25.953
but I can still feel her love
every day,

11:25.954 --> 11:27.488
like she's right beside me.

11:27.489 --> 11:28.990
Supporting me, comforting me,

11:28.991 --> 11:31.759
making me feel like I'm the most
important person in the world.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.960
Yeah, well, the one they gave me
doesn't do that.

11:35.496 --> 11:36.831
You know, the only thing
that kept me

11:36.832 --> 11:38.299
in that abusive
relationship so long

11:38.300 --> 11:39.834
was because of her cooking.

11:39.835 --> 11:42.136
You know?
She'd-she'd treat me like crap,

11:42.137 --> 11:44.438
and then think a five-cheese
macaroni casserole

11:44.439 --> 11:45.740
was gonna make it all better.

11:45.741 --> 11:48.708
And it did.

11:48.710 --> 11:50.978
Mike, you can't let this
go on forever.

11:50.979 --> 11:52.112
Okay? She's your mother.

11:52.114 --> 11:53.514
Yeah, well, if you're
so in love with her,

11:53.515 --> 11:54.548
you can give her a call.

11:54.549 --> 11:55.783
You know what started
this whole thing?

11:55.784 --> 11:58.052
She asked me to help
get her a job. Here.

11:58.053 --> 11:59.053
Seriously?

11:59.054 --> 12:00.254
What did you tell her?

12:00.255 --> 12:01.322
I can't have her working here.

12:01.323 --> 12:02.589
That woman is toxic.

12:05.225 --> 12:09.062
(man chanting in Latin)

12:16.804 --> 12:18.839
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.408
It's been five days
since my last confession.

12:21.409 --> 12:23.610
Go ahead, my child.

12:23.611 --> 12:25.878
Father, this is
very hard for me.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.149
How does a good-hearted person
who only means well

12:29.150 --> 12:31.618
become so prideful
and pigheaded?

12:31.619 --> 12:33.220
Well, we are all weak.

12:33.221 --> 12:34.554
But what is important

12:34.555 --> 12:35.989
is that you're
acknowledging your mistakes

12:35.990 --> 12:37.758
and are willing to repent.

12:37.759 --> 12:39.626
I'm not talking about me.

12:39.627 --> 12:41.927
It's my ungrateful son.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.965
I sacrificed everything
for that boy,

12:44.966 --> 12:46.366
and how does he pay me back?

12:46.367 --> 12:49.236
By saying I'm toxic
and horrible to be around.

12:49.237 --> 12:50.536
Can you believe that?

12:50.538 --> 12:54.174
That he would say it, or...?

12:54.175 --> 12:57.010
I'm not quite sure
what you're confessing.

12:57.011 --> 12:58.044
(sighs)

12:58.045 --> 13:01.448
I guess the sin of
thinking my only child

13:01.449 --> 13:04.484
might appreciate
all that I've done for him.

13:04.485 --> 13:05.852
That's not a sin.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.387
That just sounds
like being needy.

13:07.388 --> 13:10.290
Hey, I came here
for your absolution,

13:10.291 --> 13:11.458
not your opinion.

13:11.459 --> 13:13.259
Yes, but I can't
absolve you of anything

13:13.260 --> 13:14.861
if nothing's your fault.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.731
I'd like to talk
to your supervisor.

13:17.732 --> 13:19.265
Is the monsignor around?

13:19.266 --> 13:20.467
He's on a retreat, Peggy.

13:20.468 --> 13:22.102
It's just me.

13:22.103 --> 13:24.571
Well, then, maybe you need
to look at yourself.

13:24.572 --> 13:26.706
"Judge not, lest ye be judged."

13:26.707 --> 13:27.840
Matthew 7:1.

13:27.842 --> 13:29.943
"First take the log
out of your own eye,

13:29.944 --> 13:31.444
and then you will see clearly."

13:31.445 --> 13:33.413
Matthew 7:5.

13:33.414 --> 13:36.182
"Thou shalt not covet
thy parish's choir director."

13:36.183 --> 13:38.451
Book of Peggy,
chapter one, verse one,

13:38.452 --> 13:41.621
phone call to the archdiocese.

13:41.622 --> 13:43.656
We're done here.

13:43.657 --> 13:44.991
Hey, if you can't
stand the heat,

13:44.992 --> 13:46.692
stay out of the box!

13:51.831 --> 13:54.332
(sports commentator
speaking over TV)

13:56.969 --> 13:57.937
Hey.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.038
How you doing?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.006
Good.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.407
Just watching the hockey game.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.777
Well, it's not the same
watching it without your mom.

14:04.778 --> 14:05.711
You're right.

14:05.712 --> 14:09.347
It is so much better.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.983
Come on.
What?

14:10.984 --> 14:12.585
It's quieter, it's less tense.

14:12.586 --> 14:16.155
Nobody's calling me a jinx
when the other team scores.

14:16.156 --> 14:19.491
Mike, I know that your...

14:19.493 --> 14:21.927
mother can be unpleasant,

14:21.928 --> 14:24.563
and abrasive, and manipulative,

14:24.564 --> 14:29.468
and vindictive,
and a liar, but...

14:29.469 --> 14:31.036
I mean, there has to be

14:31.037 --> 14:32.837
another side.

14:34.106 --> 14:36.274
There has to be.

14:39.645 --> 14:42.181
Baby, you haven't talked to
her in a week and a half.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.682
Are you gonna tell me that...

14:43.683 --> 14:45.117
that doesn't bother you at all?

14:45.118 --> 14:46.584
Honestly, I'm fine with it.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.054
I slept nine full hours
last night.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.489
I didn't grind my teeth.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.192
I dreamt I could fly.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.594
I mean, you know,
I-I don't know what's going on,

14:55.595 --> 14:57.196
but I-I couldn't be happier.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.464
You're just riding the high

14:58.465 --> 15:00.065
off of telling off
your horrible mother,

15:00.066 --> 15:02.468
which I still can't
believe I missed, but...

15:02.469 --> 15:03.669
(sighs)

15:03.670 --> 15:05.170
It's time to make this right.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.638
I don't have to make it right.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.006
This is right.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.708
Like when I quit
eating spicy food

15:09.709 --> 15:11.076
and my heartburn went away.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.445
Now that she's gone,
no more acid burps.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.880
You know what?

15:14.881 --> 15:17.716
I'll bet I could go back
to eating Mexican food.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.418
So, what?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.753
You're never gonna talk
to your mother again?

15:21.754 --> 15:25.289
I'm not committing to nothing
until I eat a plate of nachos.

15:30.896 --> 15:33.097
(doorbell ringing)

15:34.800 --> 15:36.802
Hey.

15:36.803 --> 15:40.772
Just so you know, by marriage
you're dead to me, too.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.508
Peggy, I know you're upset.

15:43.509 --> 15:44.709
Of course I am.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.044
My son humiliated me

15:46.045 --> 15:47.512
at my own retirement party.

15:47.513 --> 15:50.248
Because you didn't
actually retire.

15:50.249 --> 15:51.715
What do you know?

15:51.717 --> 15:53.952
I talked to the ladies
you used to work with

15:53.953 --> 15:56.321
when I invited them to
your retirement party.

15:56.322 --> 15:57.322
Which Mike ruined.

15:57.323 --> 16:00.392
Because you're not
really retired!

16:00.393 --> 16:03.027
Okay? We are going
round and round here.

16:03.028 --> 16:05.563
Why don't you go round
and round and out that door?

16:05.564 --> 16:06.731
Okay, fine.

16:06.732 --> 16:07.799
I'll leave.
But you know what?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.033
I'm gonna say something first.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.602
If you spend your entire life

16:10.603 --> 16:13.104
thinking that everyone
you meet is the problem,

16:13.105 --> 16:15.340
it just might be you
that's the problem.

16:15.341 --> 16:17.175
Now you sound like my priest.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.510
And the mailman.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.811
And that idiot at the deli.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.945
I don't need a number.

16:20.946 --> 16:22.981
I know who I was in front of.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.149
Okay, maybe I'm wrong.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.919
Maybe it is
everyone else's fault.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.554
That's what I've been saying!

16:29.555 --> 16:32.390
(exhales)

16:32.391 --> 16:34.759
Look, Peggy, I get it.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.993
Okay? I'm stubborn, too.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.295
Damn right you are.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.496
And a bad cook.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.565
I like where this is going.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.267
The point is that

16:43.268 --> 16:46.337
I have learned to
admit when I'm wrong

16:46.338 --> 16:48.806
and to accept
responsibility for it.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.941
'Cause I'd rather
be wrong and loved

16:50.943 --> 16:53.243
than stubborn and alone.

16:55.279 --> 16:57.348
Is any of this landing?

16:57.349 --> 16:59.349
'Cause I-I can't
read that scowl.

17:00.217 --> 17:02.319
I heard you.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.922
Well, then, call your son.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.424
Trust me, you'll feel better.

17:06.425 --> 17:09.425
From one stubborn gal
to another.

17:10.227 --> 17:12.262
You know what?

17:12.263 --> 17:13.631
You're right.

17:13.632 --> 17:15.499
You and I aren't so different.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.502
I don't know if I'd go that far.

17:18.502 --> 17:19.837
Stubborn,

17:19.838 --> 17:22.006
always have to get our own way,

17:22.007 --> 17:24.108
madly in love with my boy...

17:24.108 --> 17:26.010
Ew.

17:26.011 --> 17:27.877
I guess what they say is true.

17:27.878 --> 17:31.047
Sons do grow up
to marry their mothers.

17:31.982 --> 17:33.983
That's not true.

17:34.918 --> 17:37.053
God, that can't be true.

17:46.354 --> 17:48.490
♪ For she's a jolly
good fellow ♪

17:48.491 --> 17:51.625
♪ Which nobody can deny. ♪

17:51.627 --> 17:53.228
This is so much better.

17:53.229 --> 17:55.162
More intimate,
not so many strangers.

17:55.164 --> 17:57.999
Well, those strangers
were my family.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.233
I didn't mean that.

17:59.234 --> 18:01.602
I meant strange, as in weird.

18:02.737 --> 18:04.505
This is the knife
you got to cut the cake?

18:04.506 --> 18:06.240
You told me to grab the one
off the counter.

18:06.241 --> 18:07.575
Never mind.

18:07.576 --> 18:09.943
I'm surprised you didn't
grab the can opener.

18:12.547 --> 18:13.548
See?

18:13.549 --> 18:16.217
This is nice.

18:16.218 --> 18:17.452
I'm sorry.

18:17.453 --> 18:19.120
I should have let you enjoy
your motherless high

18:19.121 --> 18:20.755
for a few more weeks.

18:20.756 --> 18:22.056
I got a taste.

18:22.057 --> 18:25.226
I should be good
for another 35 years.

18:25.227 --> 18:26.494
I can't believe
I actually thought

18:26.495 --> 18:28.062
she was gonna apologize to you.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.164
Ah, she did in her own way.

18:30.165 --> 18:32.366
Usually, she'd rub something
like this in my face.

18:32.367 --> 18:34.769
Now she's pretending
like it didn't even happen,

18:34.770 --> 18:37.171
which is a big step for her.

18:37.172 --> 18:39.172
Now we can cut the cake.

18:39.174 --> 18:40.608
That is the same knife.

18:40.609 --> 18:41.609
It's a different knife.

18:41.610 --> 18:42.576
She's retired.

18:42.577 --> 18:44.744
Live the lie.

18:44.746 --> 18:47.181
How about a big corner piece
for my boy?

18:47.182 --> 18:48.582
Not too big.

18:48.583 --> 18:50.357
All of a sudden
I got really bad heartburn.

18:50.358 --> 18:55.430
