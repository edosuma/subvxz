16:48.900 --> 16:51.250

like a '63 avanti,

And inside, he wants it
to look like a '63 avanti.

- But on top of that,

37:34.494 --> 37:37.236
The car itself

37:37.256 --> 37:38.904
So it's a lot lighter...

37:38.924 --> 37:40.757

set up on the front.

38:03.598 --> 38:05.189
- Yeah.
- So that's simplified

38:05.266 --> 38:06.858
Right there.

38:07.010 --> 38:10.102
You've got the holley sniper
fuel injection setup on it,

You got your msd ignition.

38:13.292 --> 38:16.793

aod automatic overdrive trans,

in the car.

38:18.188 --> 38:19.521

38:19.523 --> 38:23.466

very bulky, very heavy.

38:26.379 --> 38:29.030

- And my man ryan,

39:09.923 --> 39:14.075

went off on all of the gaps...

39:14.094 --> 39:15.501
- Yes.
- All of the body lines,

39:15.520 --> 39:16.761
Straightening everything out.

39:16.838 --> 39:18.746
It's so perfect.

39:18.765 --> 39:21.340
And he laid down just

39:21.434 --> 39:23.360
You can drive it every day.
It's completely dependable.

39:23.587 --> 39:25.253
But now you even have
more horsepower.

39:25.271 --> 39:26.771
- But it's so straight.

39:26.923 --> 39:29.273

39:29.368 --> 39:31.109
The barbie doll,

39:31.261 --> 39:33.277
And the learjet.
- Oh. [laughs]

39:33.430 --> 39:35.279
- I mean, you can see it.
It's got learjet in it.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.098
- Yeah. Oh, you can tell.
- It's got that dna in it.

39:37.117 --> 39:38.282
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:38.435 --> 39:39.876
- You know,
it looks longer now.

39:39.953 --> 39:41.878
- Well, because it got lower.
- Yeah.

39:42.029 --> 39:43.546
- I took the back down
about two inches.

39:43.623 --> 39:44.697
Took the front down
about three inches.

39:44.774 --> 39:46.124
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.033
- And measured for correct
offset on the wheels,

39:48.128 --> 39:49.719
To fill out those fender wells.

39:49.946 --> 39:51.871
- I love the rake on it.
- Just sits right.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.449
So truespoke made
these wheels for me,

39:54.451 --> 39:57.452
And they're 15x7s
in the front,

39:57.454 --> 39:59.470
But they're 15x9s in the back.

39:59.623 --> 40:01.139
- Yeah.
- And it just fills out--

40:01.291 --> 40:03.215
- The flying wedge.
- Right.

40:03.235 --> 40:05.217
Brother, what I want
to know right now, sir--

40:05.237 --> 40:06.385
Stamp of approval.

40:06.405 --> 40:09.221
- It's now my number one car.

40:09.315 --> 40:10.965
We have to name her.

40:10.967 --> 40:12.725
'cause she's dangerous.
- Yes.

40:12.819 --> 40:14.560
- She's elegant.
- Yes.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.395
- And you know
what keeps coming to me?

40:16.415 --> 40:17.414
The countess.

40:17.565 --> 40:19.416
- [laughs]

40:19.567 --> 40:20.900
- 'cause the countess
was always

40:20.919 --> 40:23.645
An elegant vampire in white.
- Yeah. Right.

40:23.647 --> 40:24.829
And if you're not careful,
she'll get you.

40:24.981 --> 40:26.589
- Oh. Yeah.
- Right! [laughs]

40:26.816 --> 40:28.166
- It's magnificent.
It really is.

40:28.318 --> 40:30.075
- I'm so glad you dig it.
- Yeah.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.836
- Kev, do me a favor, brother.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.838
- Put her back in there,

40:33.990 --> 40:36.340
And alice and I
are gonna go in the office,

40:36.493 --> 40:37.992
And we're gonna talk about
getting it home.

40:37.994 --> 40:39.160
- That's great.
- Done deal.

40:39.179 --> 40:40.753
- Thank you. Thanks, man.

40:40.772 --> 40:43.422
So it is the most
elegant-looking creature

40:43.442 --> 40:44.832
I think I've ever owned.

40:44.834 --> 40:46.184
<i> If I saw this car drive up,</i>

40:46.260 --> 40:50.447
I would roll the window down
and say, "how much?

40:50.598 --> 40:53.508
Whatever you say,
I'm buying this car."

40:53.510 --> 40:55.843
So it's now part of the family.

40:55.845 --> 40:58.012
And don't forget
to sharpen her fangs, okay?

40:58.014 --> 40:59.438
[laughter]
- got it. I got it.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.775
- Man, what an honor to meet
an honest-to-goodness

41:02.794 --> 41:05.036
Rock and roll legend,
alice cooper,

41:05.188 --> 41:08.539
And what a bigger honor to even
work on his favorite car.

41:08.616 --> 41:09.782
This is so cool.

41:09.876 --> 41:11.468
And I'm so proud
of my team, man.

41:11.619 --> 41:14.787
They worked so hard to put
that giant smile on his face

41:14.806 --> 41:16.364
<i> When that car</i>
<i> came out the gate.</i>

41:16.382 --> 41:17.957
<i> It was just a beautiful thing.</i>

41:18.051 --> 41:21.703
I know mr. Alice cooper himself
is gonna have a ball

41:21.721 --> 41:23.871
Ripping around
the streets of phoenix

41:23.965 --> 41:25.798
<i> When he gets this baby home.</i>

41:25.892 --> 41:27.875
I'll keep cranking out
his hits, from "school's out"

41:27.969 --> 41:29.468
All the way to his new record,

41:29.488 --> 41:31.821
"detroit stories,"
which I highly recommend.

41:31.973 --> 41:34.565
All I can say is,
alice is one cool cat.

41:34.659 --> 41:38.069
Now he's got an amazing,
cool car to drive every day.

41:38.163 --> 41:41.831
I am so proud of my team
for making this happen.
