WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:04.670
<i>Previously on</i> scream queens...
You need to choose one of us.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.338
Chanel #5: Fine, roger,
I'm coming with you.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.273
If someone found out my dad
is charles manson,

00:08.275 --> 00:10.275
Everyone would immediately
assume the killer is me.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.810
Zayday:
<i>The red devil kidnapped me</i>

00:11.812 --> 00:13.445
And took me to his evil lair.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.114
The red devil
is in love with you?

00:15.116 --> 00:17.449
Chanel: Tonight we cast our
votes for the next president

00:17.451 --> 00:18.450
Of kappa house.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.618
Grab some marbles.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.020
It's time to vote.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.857
♪ ♪

00:28.229 --> 00:29.395
♪ baby ♪

00:29.397 --> 00:30.629
♪ I can't wait ♪

00:59.093 --> 01:01.193
All right, so remind me again.

01:01.195 --> 01:04.063
It's black for zayday,
white for chanel?

01:04.065 --> 01:06.432
Obv. Do you think
you can handle that?

01:06.434 --> 01:08.434
I only gave you the job
of tallying the votes

01:08.436 --> 01:09.768
Because I thought
you rain man types

01:09.770 --> 01:11.170
Were super good at counting.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.838
Or are you one
of those idiot savants

01:12.840 --> 01:15.507
Who's heavy on the idiot,
light on the savant?

01:15.509 --> 01:17.342
I am neither,
thank you very much.

01:17.344 --> 01:20.179
Years before the psychoanalytic
society of america decided

01:20.181 --> 01:22.181
There was money to be made
by creating what they called

01:22.183 --> 01:23.682
The autism spectrum,

01:23.684 --> 01:25.017
I would have
been considered

01:25.019 --> 01:28.387
A daydreamer or quirky,
like a young zooey deschanel.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.456
I am not an idiot

01:30.458 --> 01:34.393
Or a moron. I am simply
a victim of my times.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.028
Are you aware
your pants are on backwards?

01:37.298 --> 01:39.231
Start counting the damn votes.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.733
Wait, what happens
if it's a tie?

01:41.735 --> 01:44.069
It's never happened before,
but kappa bylaws state

01:44.071 --> 01:46.472
That the two of them
would rule together.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.708
It's a tie.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.944
You did it!
(laughs)

01:51.946 --> 01:53.612
Grace:
Well, sort of.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.081
I know it's not ideal,
but I think you and I

01:56.083 --> 01:57.483
Would make great
copresidents.

01:57.485 --> 02:01.787
What? No, I'm not gonna be
copresident with a pledge!

02:01.789 --> 02:05.390
Farty mccandlewax
clearly miscounted the votes!

02:05.392 --> 02:06.925
Calm down, chanel,
it's not farty's fault.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.594
Then whose fault is it?

02:08.596 --> 02:10.762
It's not my fault
that my pumpkin patch

02:10.764 --> 02:11.930
Was canceled.
It's not my fault

02:11.932 --> 02:13.899
That some people
didn't vote for me because

02:13.901 --> 02:15.734
They're too intimidated
by my hotness.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.569
It's not my fault that,
because someone

02:17.571 --> 02:19.605
Is killing kappas,
I didn't have time

02:19.607 --> 02:22.908
To individually bribe each and
every one of you to vote for me.

02:22.910 --> 02:27.479
No. Clearly there is only one
person to blame for all of this.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.448
Number five.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.016
Wait, what?

02:31.018 --> 02:33.585
I hate all of you
for letting me down tonight,

02:33.587 --> 02:35.254
But, number five,
I hate you the most.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.089
I know it's on me
that I chose

02:37.091 --> 02:39.024
Idiots and weirdos
to be my minions,

02:39.026 --> 02:42.261
But you are by far the most
idiotic and the most weird,

02:42.263 --> 02:43.595
And so I blame you more
than any of them

02:43.597 --> 02:44.763
For not finding a way

02:44.765 --> 02:47.432
To ensure I retained
my presidency tonight.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.602
Chanel, come on, let's
talk this through.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.939
No! I am never talking
about anything ever again!

02:53.941 --> 02:56.508
I hate you all!

02:57.811 --> 02:59.278
(door slams)

02:59.280 --> 03:01.380
(chanel crying)

03:07.121 --> 03:09.121
Chanel #3:
Hey.

03:09.123 --> 03:11.156
Yeah, super sorry about
what happened down there.

03:11.158 --> 03:13.225
(laughing)

03:15.162 --> 03:16.962
Why are you laughing?

03:16.964 --> 03:19.464
Because, you leg humpers,
I voted for zayday.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.799
I wanted her to win.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.734
What about that fit
you threw down there?

03:22.736 --> 03:24.403
Brilliant performance, I know.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.538
I've had to develop
some serious acting skills

03:26.540 --> 03:28.807
To have sex with chad.
Chanel #5: So...

03:28.809 --> 03:31.343
You're not mad at me?
Oh, I meant everything I said
about you.

03:31.345 --> 03:34.146
I still think you're useless.
I'm just not sad about it.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.881
You see,
I've learned a few things

03:35.883 --> 03:38.817
From watching a&e documentaries
about the mafia.

03:38.819 --> 03:42.888
The most important being-- aside
from to never trust anyone,

03:42.890 --> 03:45.090
Especially those closest
to you--

03:45.092 --> 03:47.759
You never, ever want
to be the boss

03:47.761 --> 03:49.561
In a time of extreme crisis.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.764
As soon as you become the boss,
you get a target on your back,

03:52.766 --> 03:56.101
From the feds, the other
families, ambitious underlings.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.437
Sure, seems like you have
all the power,

03:58.439 --> 04:00.706
But you also take on
the most risk.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.542
Being president of
kappa house when there is

04:03.544 --> 04:05.711
A killer hunting down sisters
of kappa house

04:05.713 --> 04:07.212
Means you're the top target.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.580
I was actually
hoping one of you

04:08.582 --> 04:10.082
Bitches would betray me
and vote for her

04:10.084 --> 04:11.516
So she could win
the whole thing, but...

04:11.518 --> 04:12.718
This works out
even better.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.386
Because when I go down
and make peace

04:14.388 --> 04:16.054
With her and her pasty friend,

04:16.056 --> 04:18.423
I'm gonna look
like a skinnier angelina jolie.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.926
Wait, so this whole thing--
the pumpkin patch,

04:20.928 --> 04:22.527
The fight
against black hairy tongue--

04:22.529 --> 04:25.530
Was all an elaborate plan
to set up zayday to be killed?

04:25.532 --> 04:28.900
I like to think of it more as an
elaborate plan to save a life--

04:28.902 --> 04:30.869
Mine.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.205
Oh, don't judge me
for trying to stay alive.

04:33.207 --> 04:35.807
We all know you've been
cozying up to predatory lez

04:35.809 --> 04:37.542
Because you think
she knows karate.

04:37.544 --> 04:38.744
I just like
hanging out with her.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.078
She's cool to talk to.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.547
She knows a lot
about... Stuff.

04:42.549 --> 04:45.083
Are you going lesbian,
number three?

04:45.085 --> 04:47.085
Because while I get that
lezzie pledge is kind of cute

04:47.087 --> 04:49.921
In a "if bruce lee were a dj"
kind of way,

04:49.923 --> 04:52.057
I don't think we should be
having sex with pledges.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.826
Now, if you'll
follow me,

04:54.828 --> 04:56.828
I would like
to implement phase two

04:56.830 --> 04:59.564
Of my "chanel dies last" plan.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.170
(footsteps approaching)

05:07.841 --> 05:09.274
Grace (quietly):
Whatever she says,

05:09.276 --> 05:10.609
Do not give
an inch.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.977
You're president
now, too.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.645
Chanel:
Zayday,

05:13.647 --> 05:15.981
This is the key
to the storage room.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.783
Where we keep
our tampon backstock

05:17.785 --> 05:20.752
In case of a nuclear war
and all of our secrets.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.254
It's the most holy
room in the house,

05:22.256 --> 05:23.755
And only the
president has the key.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.590
I want you to have it.

05:25.592 --> 05:26.925
What's your game here?

05:26.927 --> 05:28.927
I trust you about as far
as I can throw you.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.762
No game.

05:30.764 --> 05:31.930
I may be a
stone-cold bitch,

05:31.932 --> 05:33.432
But I love kappa

05:33.434 --> 05:35.934
And I want it to survive
these challenging times.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.769
So if you think you
can do a better job

05:37.771 --> 05:39.504
Than I can, then I say

05:39.506 --> 05:41.340
Let's give the
zayday administration a chance.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.442
Sisters

05:43.444 --> 05:45.444
And anyone else
who might be listening,

05:45.446 --> 05:49.314
I present to you the acting
president of kappa kappa tau,

05:49.316 --> 05:51.783
Zayday... Something!

05:51.785 --> 05:53.919
Williams. But that'll do.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.960
(knocking)
(door opens)

06:01.962 --> 06:03.295
Grace:
<i>Excuse me, madam president,</i>

06:03.297 --> 06:05.630
The speaker of the house
is on line one.

06:05.632 --> 06:08.567
Take a message.
(laughs)

06:08.569 --> 06:10.836
Z! Oh, come here.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.338
I'm so proud of you.
This is so exciting. I mean,

06:13.340 --> 06:16.141
Kappa is really gonna change,
and it all starts with you.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.676
Well, the biggest change
I'd like to implement

06:17.678 --> 06:19.711
Is for everyone to stop getting
murdered by a serial killer.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.380
That's what we need
to talk about.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.014
I know we don't know
who the killer is,

06:23.016 --> 06:24.649
But we know it traces back
to this house.

06:24.651 --> 06:27.519
If the red devil is killing
kappas, that means some of them

06:27.521 --> 06:29.020
Have to know something.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.990
We just need to find out what.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.992
A slumber
party.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.360
What?

06:35.362 --> 06:38.330
There are two things that always
happen at a slumber party:

06:38.332 --> 06:39.698
Someone experiments
with lesbianism

06:39.700 --> 06:41.266
And secrets are revealed.

06:41.268 --> 06:42.768
Oh, my god. That is brilliant.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.669
We can create situations
and scenarios

06:44.671 --> 06:46.171
To really prime the pump.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.939
Like a big game
of truth or dare.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.841
That'll be my first act
as president.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.843
We'll lock everybody up
overnight,

06:51.845 --> 06:54.846
And we're bound
to find out something.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.615
Can I have y'all's attention?

06:56.617 --> 07:00.252
Kappa house is having
a slumber party!

07:00.254 --> 07:02.454
What? Ew. Gross. No.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.289
Yes. It's gonna be great.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.590
Look, we're gonna lock
ourselves in,

07:05.592 --> 07:06.958
Play some
games,

07:06.960 --> 07:08.427
Get cozy...
What are you
talking about?!

07:08.429 --> 07:09.561
No, we are
not ten!

07:09.563 --> 07:10.896
Shut up,
chanel.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.230
It's a
great idea.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.598
A slumber party
sounds fun.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.934
Let's play spin
the bottle.

07:15.936 --> 07:16.601
What?

07:16.603 --> 07:17.736
You heard me.
I want

07:17.738 --> 07:20.105
To play spin the bottle.
We're doing it.

07:20.107 --> 07:20.939
Zayday:
What'd I tell you?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.641
Someone always goes lesbian.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.410
Uh, yeah, well, spin the bottle
sounds great, I guess,

07:25.412 --> 07:27.913
But don't you think
a rousing game of truth or dare

07:27.915 --> 07:28.914
Would be way more fun

07:28.916 --> 07:30.215
To play
first?

07:30.217 --> 07:31.249
No.
No?

07:31.251 --> 07:33.585
We're having a slumber party,

07:33.587 --> 07:35.387
And before we do anything else,

07:35.389 --> 07:37.722
We're playing
spin the damn bottle.

07:37.724 --> 07:38.890
Let's vote.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.026
All those in favor
of a slumber party.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.800
There. It's decided.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.069
We're having a
slumber party, okay?

07:51.071 --> 07:54.439
Everyone get in your pjs,
and be down here at 5:00, okay?

07:54.441 --> 07:56.475
Why spin the bottle?

07:56.477 --> 07:58.643
There aren't any dickies here!

07:58.645 --> 08:01.780
Dickies:
<i>Caulfield! Caulfield!</i>
<i>Caulfield!</i>

08:01.782 --> 08:04.483
(cheering)
caulfield, you suck it,
bro! You suck it so hard!

08:04.485 --> 08:07.452
Suck it! Suck it! Come
on, baby! Come on, baby!

08:07.454 --> 08:09.821
Don't stop now.
Don't st...

08:09.823 --> 08:10.956
45 seconds.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.357
(cheering)

08:12.359 --> 08:14.793
Brother caulfield,

08:14.795 --> 08:18.964
You just chugged four liters
of canned pasta in 45 seconds.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.800
So if anybody ever tells you
that just because you got

08:21.802 --> 08:23.635
Your arms chopped off
by a serial killer

08:23.637 --> 08:25.637
That somehow you're handicapped,

08:25.639 --> 08:27.506
You have 'em give me a call.

08:27.508 --> 08:30.041
And I'm gonna tell 'em
this story.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.544
(clears throat)
chad.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.482
The dollar scholars need to have
a little talk with you, mate.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.650
Listen,

08:38.652 --> 08:41.019
This is an intervention.

08:41.021 --> 08:44.189
Mate, there's a nasty rumor
going around

08:44.191 --> 08:47.325
Saying you're having sex
with... With the dean.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.393
That is not a nasty rumor.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.295
That is a
true rumor.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.230
I am totally
porkin' dean munsch.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.465
Chick is smokin'.

08:53.467 --> 08:54.833
There's also
another rumor saying

08:54.835 --> 08:56.968
That you slept
with one of the security guards.

08:56.970 --> 09:00.338
Denise hemphill.
Um, yeah.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.073
(groaning)
I mean, she is fun.
I'm not kidding.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.875
I mean, that girl knows
what she's doing.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.043
But what about chanel?

09:05.045 --> 09:07.045
No, chanel's good, too.
I mean, she's...

09:07.047 --> 09:09.381
When you have sex with chanel,
there's just, like, so much,

09:09.383 --> 09:11.750
Like... Crying.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.852
Look, chad, we've talked
about this as a house,

09:13.854 --> 09:16.087
And we all agree
it's super weird

09:16.089 --> 09:17.856
That you sleep with
so many old people.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.824
Hmm.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.065
Oh. Wow.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.735
You guys have really given me
something to think about.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.071
While I've always believed one
of the most fun parts

09:33.073 --> 09:35.240
Of college life is sleeping
with the faculty,

09:35.242 --> 09:39.377
I now realize that concentrating
on porking popular girls,

09:39.379 --> 09:41.046
It's in all
of our best interests.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.181
Therefore,
I hereby pledge

09:43.183 --> 09:46.518
I'm gonna concentrate
on my relationship with chanel,

09:46.520 --> 09:48.853
'cause she's freakin' hot
as hell

09:48.855 --> 09:50.689
And her dad was a bundler
for mitt romney.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.890
Well, you know,

09:51.892 --> 09:53.391
A little birdie told me

09:53.393 --> 09:55.226
Kappa house are having
a slumber party tonight.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.195
So I propose
a panty raid.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.264
All those in favor?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.334
Panty raid!

10:07.574 --> 10:09.574
Chanel:
Nope!

10:09.576 --> 10:11.910
Not doing this. I don't
understand why we're playing

10:11.912 --> 10:14.212
Spin the bottle. There are
exactly zero wangers here.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.715
Chanel, I will act as proxy
and kiss candle vlogger

10:16.717 --> 10:19.284
So that you
don't have to.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.754
You taste
like wax.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.556
You taste
good, too.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.625
My turn. It's my turn.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.228
There. I just spun it.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.598
<i>Dear god, if you really exist,</i>
<i>please show me by letting it</i>

10:33.600 --> 10:35.834
<i>Land on predatory lez</i>
<i>so I can explore these</i>

10:35.836 --> 10:38.236
<i>Confusing, conflicting feelings</i>
<i>I've been having lately.</i>

10:39.906 --> 10:42.574
Re-spin. New rule:
You can re-spin.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.514
Oh. Sam.
I guess we have to kiss.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.487
You're a great kisser.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.522
Thanks.
I guess you're okay.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.491
I'll say it again.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.826
I don't know
why we're doing this.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.699
Hey.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.101
Was I interrupting you?

11:10.103 --> 11:11.269
No, it's cool.
I was just

11:11.271 --> 11:12.504
Practicing
looking disinterested.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.773
Do you do that, too?
Because when I was a kid,

11:14.775 --> 11:17.676
No one liked me 'cause my dad
was so rich, so I started acting

11:17.678 --> 11:19.644
Like I didn't care.
But then I realized

11:19.646 --> 11:21.513
I really wasn't pretending
and I actually didn't care.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.982
I'm pretty sure I was born
without that part of the brain

11:23.984 --> 11:25.283
That actually feels stuff.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.118
We have so much in common.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.486
I'm starting to think
we have something

11:28.488 --> 11:30.321
Very important
and specific in common.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.791
My sex life up until this point
is what you'd call unusual.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.125
When I turned 18,

11:34.127 --> 11:35.794
I started dating
one of my dad's friends.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.128
He committed suicide
by running himself over

11:37.130 --> 11:38.563
With a golf cart at the club.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.565
The guy I dated
here last year

11:40.567 --> 11:43.234
Got so obsessed with my ears
he had to leave school.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.403
Now he writes me letters
threatening to cut them off

11:45.405 --> 11:46.738
If he ever sees them again.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.840
Which is why I always
wear my ear muffs.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.843
I understand. I think the only
way to be sure of your feelings

11:51.845 --> 11:54.579
Is if you let me gently rub
your uterus right now.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.414
No. You don't understand.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.416
I'm charles manson's daughter.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.719
His charisma and madness
is in my blood.

12:00.721 --> 12:04.155
When I love someone,
it drives them insane.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.324
No. I can't.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.259
We can be alibilibidibuddies
and do our best

12:08.261 --> 12:10.595
To protect each other,
but our vaginas may never touch.

12:10.597 --> 12:11.930
It's too dangerous.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.036
Believe me when I say

12:18.038 --> 12:20.238
That if it was possible
for me to feel anything

12:20.240 --> 12:22.307
I would totally
be crying right now.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.251
(oven timer dings)

12:33.253 --> 12:34.719
What are you guys doing?

12:34.721 --> 12:36.855
Well, hello,
madam president.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.690
Making chocolate-
covered peanuts

12:38.692 --> 12:40.558
For chanel's
special s'mores.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.360
But those
are packing peanuts.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.529
That doesn't seem healthy.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.198
Uh, yeah. Cuts the calorie
content in, like, half.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.134
Why are you two back

12:49.136 --> 12:50.268
Without
any ice?

12:50.270 --> 12:51.536
We have a problem.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.037
All the doors
are locked solid.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.039
Windows, too.
Upstairs and down.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.443
(alarm softly beeping)

13:08.255 --> 13:09.754
They're right.
We're trapped.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.756
Wait, you guys, I think
I know what this is.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.224
It's probably my dad.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.793
He's been getting on
me to stay inside

13:14.795 --> 13:16.294
Where it's safe,
and I'm pretty sure

13:16.296 --> 13:17.762
He did this because
I wouldn't listen.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.063
He sounds like
an awful parent.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.598
Grace:
He's overprotective,

13:20.600 --> 13:22.433
But I'm telling you there
is nothing to worry about.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.103
Of course it's something to
worry about. It's not your dad

13:25.105 --> 13:27.572
And his 1986<i> miami vice</i>
five o'clock shadow.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.274
It was the killer.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.242
But, guys, how did he lock
every window and every door

13:31.244 --> 13:32.777
Without us noticing?

13:32.779 --> 13:34.112
He must have hacked
into the fail-safe

13:34.114 --> 13:35.213
Security system
I had installed.

13:37.617 --> 13:40.285
One recent stormy night,
chad and I

13:40.287 --> 13:42.153
Watched<i> panic room</i> on netflix,
and chad was like,

13:42.155 --> 13:43.421
"you totally need one of those."

13:43.423 --> 13:45.690
But jodie foster's
was small and gross,

13:45.692 --> 13:47.592
So I decided to have the whole
house turned into a panic room.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.928
But wait, doesn't that mean
that there's some sort of switch

13:49.930 --> 13:52.263
Somewhere to deactivate it?
Yes, theoretically,

13:52.265 --> 13:54.599
But the guy said the kill switch
was on back order

13:54.601 --> 13:56.134
And he'd have to install it
in a couple of weeks.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.468
Guys, I am freaking out!

13:57.470 --> 13:59.537
I hate being trapped
in small places.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.273
Okay, this house is literally,
like, 15,000 square feet.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.975
There's only one reason
why the killer

14:03.977 --> 14:05.677
Would do something like this--

14:05.679 --> 14:07.512
To pick us off one by one.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.913
That's what I would do.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.817
Guess it's just a matter
of time before one of us

14:12.819 --> 14:15.887
Or all of us ends up dead.

14:17.691 --> 14:18.923
(all scream)

14:25.632 --> 14:27.031
(line ringing)

14:27.033 --> 14:28.566
Chad:
You're go for chad radwell.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.134
Chad, it's me, chanel.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.637
Well, well, well.
Isn't this a coincidence.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.506
I was headed over to kappa house
to steal some of your panties.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.542
Oh, chad, that's amazing.
I love you so much.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.810
But, chad, listen.

14:38.812 --> 14:40.511
You have to help us.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.146
We're trapped in the house
and the power went out

14:42.148 --> 14:43.681
And my phone is the only one
that's working

14:43.683 --> 14:45.216
Because I'm pretty sure
the killer

14:45.218 --> 14:47.085
Knocked down a cell tower
or something.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.586
Wait, well,
why does yours work, then?

14:48.588 --> 14:49.988
Because mine's
a satellite phone.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.323
Elon musk gave it to me.
It's designed for space travel.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.925
My dad is super gross rich,
chad.

14:53.927 --> 14:56.160
I know. That's my favorite thing
about you, baby.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.830
Look, chanel, before I come
and save you and whatnot,

14:58.832 --> 15:00.899
I got to get some things
off my chest.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.601
A, I had sex with the dean.
What?

15:03.603 --> 15:05.570
Look, I'm prepared to say
I'm sorry I did that.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.906
What I'm not prepared to do
is say the sex was bad.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.240
Because it was not.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.075
Oh, also, I hooked up
with the, uh, security guard.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.911
Officer hemphill?
Yeah.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.712
Yeah. I'm not gonna apologize
for that one.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.047
Chad, I'm about
to get murdered,

15:16.049 --> 15:17.715
So can you please just
hang up and get over here?

15:17.717 --> 15:19.550
Chad radwell is on the way.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.619
I love you, chad.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.556
Hello?

15:25.558 --> 15:28.359
I... Love you, too, sort of.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.694
(laughing)

15:29.696 --> 15:32.063
(all panting)

15:32.065 --> 15:34.599
How on earth
are we supposed to get in

15:34.601 --> 15:36.567
If all the doors
and windows are locked?

15:36.569 --> 15:40.104
Dude, we climb up the ladder,
break the windows upstairs,

15:40.106 --> 15:42.740
Save all the girls,
climb back down,

15:42.742 --> 15:44.776
Then it's vagina city
for all of us.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.744
I thought you said chanel
had all the windows bomb-proofed

15:46.746 --> 15:48.379
So that we can't
break them.

15:48.381 --> 15:51.049
Yeah... Downstairs
windows, dude.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.884
Why would you bomb-proof
upstairs windows?

15:52.886 --> 15:54.152
For what, like, a flying bomb?

15:54.154 --> 15:56.888
A flying bomb
would be a missile, chad.

15:56.890 --> 15:59.057
Honestly, where's the
red devil gonna get a missile?

15:59.059 --> 16:02.260
Don't be an idiot.
Hold this. It's hero time.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.928
(exhales)

16:03.930 --> 16:05.330
Ah, here we go.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.102
Oh, chad,
you've come for me.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.770
Save me
and I'm yours forever.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.473
Uh... (stammers)

16:15.475 --> 16:17.608
I'm not really sure I'm ready
for that level of commitment.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.111
Chad, please, I'm trapped
in the house with a killer.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.112
Break the glass!

16:21.114 --> 16:23.614
Not until you take back
what you said.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.950
Fine, just save me, chad.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.018
And?

16:27.954 --> 16:29.787
And I'm yours
for an amount of time

16:29.789 --> 16:31.255
You feel is appropriate.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.590
Stand back, fair maiden.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.159
Chad's about
to be a hero.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.934
Oh, chad!

16:42.936 --> 16:45.837
(kisses)
oh...

16:47.107 --> 16:48.439
Chad:
Whoa, red devil!

16:48.441 --> 16:50.842
Get up here now!
Go, go, go, go, go. Climb.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.610
Red devil, coming in hot!

16:52.612 --> 16:53.778
He's moving.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.113
Oh, he's moving,
he's moving.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.614
Hurry.
Caulfield, you climb.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.117
You climb, you armless bastard!

16:59.119 --> 17:00.852
Caulfield:
I'm gonna make it.
I'm gonna make it.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.654
Chad, no, that's
the only phone we have!

17:03.656 --> 17:06.257
Tonight is not the night
caulfield mount herman dies!

17:07.027 --> 17:08.659
Chad:
Come on!

17:08.661 --> 17:10.428
(all screaming)

17:12.198 --> 17:13.664
Earl:
What do we do now?

17:13.666 --> 17:15.299
The only thing we can do:

17:15.301 --> 17:17.869
Give him the dignity
of watching him die.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.344
(all groaning and screaming)
okay, okay,

17:26.346 --> 17:27.578
Okay, he's good, he's good.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.649
Oh!
God.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.651
(coughs)

17:33.653 --> 17:35.019
Chad:
No, no, not the head.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.187
Oh, he's going for the...

17:36.189 --> 17:38.022
(all scream)

17:38.024 --> 17:40.658
Grace:
<i>Well, that answers that.</i>

17:40.660 --> 17:42.560
Someone in this house definitely
knows who the killer is.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.829
I hear you loud and clear, girl.
It's truth or dare time.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.898
Wait, zayday, stop.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.533
Wh-what are we doing?

17:48.535 --> 17:50.168
Whatever it takes to stop
the douche that's trying

17:50.170 --> 17:52.036
To kill everybody.
No, I mean, like,
what are we doing?

17:52.038 --> 17:54.338
I mean, do you
ever just stop

17:54.340 --> 17:57.175
And ask yourself if we can
actually pull this off?

17:57.177 --> 17:58.443
Maybe...

17:58.445 --> 18:00.745
Maybe we all just need
to get out of here.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.947
Leave school.
The best way

18:02.949 --> 18:05.516
To avoid a shark attack
is to not go in the water.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.554
We all have a crisis
of faith sometimes.

18:09.556 --> 18:12.457
But no one is gonna
tell a sisterhood

18:12.459 --> 18:14.792
With zayday williams
as the president

18:14.794 --> 18:16.260
When they can
and can't go swimming.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.262
So pull it together

18:18.264 --> 18:20.598
And let's go play this game
of truth or dare.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.600
'cause ain't nothing and no one

18:22.602 --> 18:24.402
Stopping the hot tsunami
of truth

18:24.404 --> 18:26.070
Rolling into this house
tonight.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.505
Come on.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.882
All right, you guys.
It's time to play a game

18:37.884 --> 18:40.885
Of truth or dare.
Chanel: Just saying,

18:40.887 --> 18:42.753
Now would be the time
to play spin the bottle.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.055
We finally have
some dickies here.

18:44.057 --> 18:45.089
Someone in this house

18:45.091 --> 18:46.124
Knows something
about the murderer

18:46.126 --> 18:47.258
That they're
not telling us,

18:47.260 --> 18:49.227
And I intend
to find out what.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.229
Okay, here's how the game works.

18:51.231 --> 18:54.565
When it's your turn, you
have a choice of truth or dare.

18:54.567 --> 18:58.269
If you choose truth,
you have to tell the truth.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.438
And if you choose dare...

19:00.440 --> 19:03.808
I don't know.
Maybe you're hiding something.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.978
Ooh! Yes.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.646
Jennifer:
But wouldn't you just lie?

19:08.648 --> 19:10.148
I mean,
if I were the killer,

19:10.150 --> 19:12.483
I'd pick truth
and then just lie.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.452
(chuckles)

19:14.454 --> 19:16.988
Uh, well, the-the game's not
truth or dare or lie.
(chuckles)

19:16.990 --> 19:18.856
Just truth or dare.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.758
If you want to lie,
you can just pick dare.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.995
No, you'd pick truth
and then you'd lie.

19:23.997 --> 19:27.465
(chuckles) uh, no,
you can't lie. That's the...

19:27.467 --> 19:30.001
That's the whole point
of truth or dare. You can't lie.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.137
But...
I'm sorry, the game's
pretty damn simple!

19:33.139 --> 19:36.841
Okay? It's truth or dare,
all right? If you pick

19:36.843 --> 19:39.810
Truth, you have to tell
the truth. If you pick dare...

19:39.812 --> 19:41.779
It's gonna be really suspicious,
and I'm gonna think

19:41.781 --> 19:44.115
You had something to do
with my sweet bro boone dying

19:44.117 --> 19:45.316
And my rad bro
caulfield

19:45.318 --> 19:46.717
Getting his arms...

19:46.719 --> 19:48.152
And then his head chopped off!

19:48.154 --> 19:51.222
And dodger.
Will you stop
whining about dodger?!

19:51.224 --> 19:52.890
Everybody agrees that dude
was holding you back.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.225
Nobody misses him.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.793
Now let's play
some truth or dare

19:55.795 --> 19:58.196
And find out
who the killer is.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.968
Number five, truth or dare?

20:03.970 --> 20:05.636
Truth.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.171
Okay. Number five,

20:07.173 --> 20:09.373
Does your vagina have teeth?

20:13.246 --> 20:15.246
That's insane.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.914
No, it doesn't, chanel.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.249
I thought
she wasn't allowed to lie.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.917
I'm not lying.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.052
My vagina
doesn't have teeth.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.320
Can I rephrase the question?

20:22.322 --> 20:23.321
Does your vagina

20:23.323 --> 20:24.989
<i>Still</i> have teeth?

20:24.991 --> 20:27.091
No! The answer is no!
"no, it no longer
has teeth,

20:27.093 --> 20:29.260
So it used to have teeth,
but you got them removed"?

20:29.262 --> 20:31.495
No, I didn't.
So your vagina still has teeth.

20:31.497 --> 20:32.830
Which one is it, number five?

20:32.832 --> 20:35.233
Sounds like you're
trapped in a web of lies.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.935
You're forfeiting
your turn, bitch.

20:39.205 --> 20:42.740
Um... Okay, I guess
it's my turn, then.

20:44.177 --> 20:46.277
Sam.

20:46.279 --> 20:49.280
Truth... Or dare?

20:49.282 --> 20:51.449
Truth.

20:51.451 --> 20:55.119
What is chanel #3's
deepest, darkest secret?

20:55.121 --> 20:56.587
Chanel #3:
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

20:56.589 --> 20:58.289
<i>She knows I have</i>
<i>weird feelings for her.</i>

20:58.291 --> 21:00.391
<i>She's gonna tell everyone.</i>
<i>I have to just blurt it out.</i>

21:00.393 --> 21:02.927
Her deepest,
darkest secret is...

21:02.929 --> 21:05.563
Her father is charles manson.
I have weird, sexy
feelings for sam.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.231
What?

21:07.233 --> 21:09.066
Zayday:
Hold on.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.568
What did you just say?

21:10.570 --> 21:14.338
I have weird sexy
feelings for sam.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.741
Wh-what did<i> you</i> just say?

21:16.743 --> 21:18.743
Her father is
charles manson.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.912
Okay, can I just say, number
three is definitely the killer.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.247
No, I'm not!

21:23.249 --> 21:24.749
You promised you
wouldn't tell.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.217
Sorry. I had
to tell the truth.

21:26.219 --> 21:27.418
Of course you're the killer.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.753
I mean, your dad's
charles manson, dude.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.388
If you're not the killer,
you should probably...

21:30.390 --> 21:31.555
You know, give it a shot.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.057
I think you'd be
pretty good at it.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.759
Thanks.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.761
My turn.

21:36.763 --> 21:39.063
Sam, truth or dare.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.098
I just went.
Truth or dare?!

21:41.100 --> 21:42.733
Dare.
I dare you

21:42.735 --> 21:45.403
To go down to the creepy
kappa house basement

21:45.405 --> 21:47.838
Where we keep all our
deepest, darkest secrets,

21:47.840 --> 21:50.308
And take a little
nap in the bathtub.

21:52.278 --> 21:53.744
Fine.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.446
Chad:
Oh!

21:55.448 --> 21:57.581
Yes! Bathtub naps.
This is getting good.

21:57.583 --> 22:00.451
Okay, guys, I propose
we take a little break,

22:00.453 --> 22:01.619
You know,

22:01.621 --> 22:03.287
Take a whiz,
get a refill.

22:03.289 --> 22:05.289
Bro, grab my phone.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.425
There's a little playlist
I put together called "douche."

22:07.427 --> 22:09.760
I want you to call that up
on the bluetooth speakers

22:09.762 --> 22:11.128
So we can get
our dance on.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.130

♪ I get knocked down,
but I get... ♪

22:16.469 --> 22:18.336
Look, I'm really sorry.

You know what?<i> I'm</i> sorry.
I'm sorry I ever trusted you.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.141
But I wanted to talk
about the other thing you said,

22:24.143 --> 22:25.843
About how you thought
you had feelings for me.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.445
The only feelings
I have for you now

22:27.447 --> 22:29.280
Are rage and pissed-offedness.

22:29.282 --> 22:31.615
Now go sit in that bathtub and
think about what you've done

22:31.617 --> 22:33.718
And try not
to rub one out, okay?

22:36.155 --> 22:38.823
Come on! I said
I was sorry!

22:38.825 --> 22:40.858

If anybody's down here,
please don't jump out at me.

Wait. If you're gonna kill me,

24:36.275 --> 24:38.342
At least show me
who you are first.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.481
I knew it.
I knew it was you.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.484

24:46.486 --> 24:49.453
Please.
You don't have to do this.

24:49.455 --> 24:51.455
I could help you.

24:51.457 --> 24:53.491
(muffled screaming)

25:01.868 --> 25:03.501
Hi, chad.

25:03.503 --> 25:04.869
The killer took all the food

25:04.871 --> 25:06.971
Out of all the cabinets
and left us nothing

25:06.973 --> 25:08.506
But watermelon lime
coolers in the fridge.

25:09.775 --> 25:11.642
He's trying
to starve us to death.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.777
There's never any food in there.
Just laxatives.

25:13.779 --> 25:15.813
Chanel's orders. Chad,

25:15.815 --> 25:18.015
After our erotic bonding
session in the cemetery

25:18.017 --> 25:20.651
And our coitus interruptus
in the haunted house,

25:20.653 --> 25:23.153
I got the impression that
you and I are on the verge

25:23.155 --> 25:25.356
Of being the next "it" couple.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.625
Yeah.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.860
I just don't know
what would make you think that.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.829
You texted me saying,
"we are on the verge

25:31.831 --> 25:33.797
Of being the next 'it' couple,
hester. Love, chad."

25:33.799 --> 25:35.833
See, this is the problem
with texting, you know?

25:35.835 --> 25:37.968
You can't hear the context.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.137
You've been spending a lot
of time with chanel tonight.

25:40.139 --> 25:43.474
Even though I decided
to not wear a bra,

25:43.476 --> 25:47.144
You haven't been staring
at my shirt raisins once.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.480
Okay, look, I was waiting
to talk to you about this

25:49.482 --> 25:51.315
'cause secretly I was hoping
you'd be killed

25:51.317 --> 25:53.050
And I wouldn't have
to hurt your feelings.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.185
I just don't think
it would work out with us.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.888
You're nuts, and not like
a typical crazy-eyes co-ed,

25:57.890 --> 25:59.857
But wake-up-with-my
penis-in-a-jar lunatic.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.759
Now, that puts me
in a tough spot

26:01.761 --> 26:04.228
Because that also means
you'd be the screw of my life.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.096
I mean, that kind of insanity
means your muffin--

26:06.098 --> 26:07.731
It's space mountain
levels of fun.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.768
I love space mountain.
Best ride at disneyland.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.102
But I love my penis more.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.904
Let me tell you
two things about me.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.573
Okay.

26:15.575 --> 26:18.876
Number one--
I never take second place.

26:18.878 --> 26:22.546
And number two-- I don't stop
till I get what I want.

26:22.548 --> 26:23.581
What's going on in here?

26:23.583 --> 26:25.215
Nothing, chanel.

26:25.217 --> 26:28.252
Just getting some wine
coolers for my sisters.

26:28.254 --> 26:31.255
By the way, chanel,
you look amazing tonight.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.257
Being imprisoned
by a psycho killer

26:33.259 --> 26:35.159
In your own house
really suits you.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.931
Was that salad spinner
hitting on you?

26:40.933 --> 26:43.767
Yeah, totally, which is
why I'm glad you showed up.

26:43.769 --> 26:47.071
I am super turned on from her,
and I need some sweet release.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.707
Is there any, like, crisco
or cooking oil here?

26:49.709 --> 26:51.475
Just, like,
dry handies bum me out.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.612
I have a better idea.

26:54.614 --> 26:55.779
Let's go out

26:55.781 --> 26:57.114
And join the others.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.616
It's game time again.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.821
As kappa house copresident,
I think I can speak

27:03.823 --> 27:06.757
For everyone when I say
we've all been through hell.

27:06.759 --> 27:10.260
So, I propose we treat
ourselves to a little heaven.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.762
Seven minutes in heaven.

27:11.764 --> 27:12.930
I go first,

27:12.932 --> 27:14.765
And I pick chad.
Wait. No. Hold on.

27:14.767 --> 27:15.933
The whole point
of this slumber party was

27:15.935 --> 27:17.134
To figure out who the killer is.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.435
Chanel:
Oh, give it a rest,

27:18.437 --> 27:19.603
Nancy drew.

27:19.605 --> 27:21.338
Whatever your plan was,
it isn't working.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.806
So, if you'll excuse
me for seven minutes,

27:22.808 --> 27:25.476
I'm going to ask
my boyfriend, chad radwell,

27:25.478 --> 27:26.977
To dial "o"

27:26.979 --> 27:28.145
On my pink telephone.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.613
Chad?

27:29.615 --> 27:31.482
Would you like to pat
the little man in the canoe?

27:31.484 --> 27:34.618
(chuckles)
(squeaks)

27:34.620 --> 27:37.121
(footsteps running)

27:37.123 --> 27:39.823
(moaning)

27:39.825 --> 27:41.358
I'm making out with you.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.327
I'm making out
with you so hard.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.762
(laughs)

27:44.764 --> 27:46.497
Oh, chad?
Mm-hmm.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.132
Chad?
Mm-hmm.

27:48.134 --> 27:51.168
I want to take our
relationship to the next level.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.936
What?

27:52.938 --> 27:55.339
Well...

27:55.341 --> 27:56.640
I want us to be together,

27:56.642 --> 27:58.609
But I want it to
mean something.

27:58.611 --> 28:00.711
Yeah. No, I'm ready to do this.

28:00.713 --> 28:03.180
What? Really?
Definitely. I mean,

28:03.182 --> 28:05.482
I love boning girls
all over this great land.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.718
But really,
at the end of the day,

28:07.720 --> 28:09.353
I just kind of want
to bone<i> one</i> girl.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.622
Like, that one
special girl.
Mm-hmm.

28:11.624 --> 28:13.824
And I don't know. I just
didn't think that girl was you

28:13.826 --> 28:16.193
Because, obviously,
there's so much wrong with you.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.863
But then I think about
the good things about you.

28:19.865 --> 28:23.400
Like... Like how
gullible you are,

28:23.402 --> 28:25.369
How rich your dad is.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.738
And when I think
about that girl--

28:27.740 --> 28:30.841
The really rich one
who's easy to trick--

28:30.843 --> 28:32.509
I think she's
pretty special, too.

28:32.511 --> 28:34.378
Chad!

28:38.884 --> 28:41.085
Chanel?

28:41.087 --> 28:43.353
Will you get back
together with me?

28:43.355 --> 28:47.825
Look, all of these murders
on campus have caused me

28:47.827 --> 28:50.194
To do a lot of
soul searching,

28:50.196 --> 28:52.096
And I think I've
arrived at a place

28:52.098 --> 28:53.697
Of deep personal
awareness.

28:53.699 --> 28:58.502
So, I would consider taking
you back under one condition.

28:58.504 --> 29:02.172
You have to pinky-pledge that
you will be monogamous to me.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.274
You will not have
sex with anyone else.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.476
Do you understand me?

29:14.720 --> 29:16.420
Okay.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.155
Oh, chad!

29:19.425 --> 29:22.292
Okay, time's up.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.096
Roger, we're next.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.298
(chanel scoffs)
roger?!

29:35.741 --> 29:37.808
(screaming)

29:45.451 --> 29:46.950
I came to see
if sam needed anything,

29:46.952 --> 29:48.285
But she doesn't
because she's dead!

29:48.287 --> 29:51.088
Dude, she looks like prepackaged
meat from the supermarket.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.422
Chanel #3 is standing
right there.

29:52.424 --> 29:53.724
Show some respect.

29:53.726 --> 29:55.092
We weren't dating.
Chanel:
Wait.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.127
If she's dead and all the doors
are locked from the outside,

29:57.129 --> 29:58.595
That means the killer
is in the house!

29:58.597 --> 30:00.430
Oh, god, has someone
checked on the kids?

30:00.432 --> 30:02.599
Chanel: The killer is standing
right in front of us.

30:02.601 --> 30:05.402
Pretty convenient that you're
the one who found the body.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.237
I would be offended
by that accusation, chanel,

30:07.239 --> 30:09.606
If I wasn't so honored
that you were thinking about me.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.308
You can knock off the "neck
brace in the headlights" act.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.609
You're the darkest bitch
of them all.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.611
Number 3 told me
that you were the one

30:14.613 --> 30:16.280
Who turned me in
to the police.

30:16.282 --> 30:17.915
Those are some serious
accusations,

30:17.917 --> 30:19.316
And they make no sense.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.784
Considering everything
that I've seen

30:20.786 --> 30:22.786
And done for you here, chanel--
ms. Bean,

30:22.788 --> 30:25.122
Number two. I would
be opening myself up to a lot

30:25.124 --> 30:26.957
Of trouble if I were to turn you
in to the authorities.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.292
Grace: It doesn't do
any of us any good

30:28.294 --> 30:30.127
To start accusing each other
with no evidence.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.261
But it is pretty
suspicious

30:31.263 --> 30:33.096
That you're the one
who found her, hester.

30:33.098 --> 30:34.865
Okay, I understand.

30:34.867 --> 30:37.267
I suggest that we just have
someone stand guard and watch me

30:37.269 --> 30:39.469
For the rest of the night,
or until someone else dies,

30:39.471 --> 30:41.104
Therefore proving that
I am not the killer.

30:41.106 --> 30:42.272
I nominate chad.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.941
Screw that,
evil harrington.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.943
We're locking you
upstairs in my closet

30:45.945 --> 30:48.011
Until we can find
a way out of here.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.056
This feels so good.

30:59.058 --> 31:01.959
Yeah, it does.
No, not this.

31:01.961 --> 31:04.962
I mean, it feels so good
now that my brother's gone.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.897
It's such a relief.

31:06.899 --> 31:09.132
The only time
we've ever been apart

31:09.134 --> 31:11.535
Was the two minutes
that separated our birth.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.136
The only bummer is, like,

31:13.138 --> 31:15.005
We created this amazing
clicking language,

31:15.007 --> 31:17.007
And now I have nobody
to use it with.

31:17.009 --> 31:19.209
Wait. I could teach you!

31:19.211 --> 31:22.479
Okay, okay, so, two high
clicks means, "hello."

31:22.481 --> 31:23.814
Okay, so...

31:23.816 --> 31:25.382
(clicking)

31:25.384 --> 31:26.817
And three low clicks means,

31:26.819 --> 31:28.752
"man, this ice cream
is delicious."

31:28.754 --> 31:29.820
Okay, so...

31:29.822 --> 31:30.921
(clicking)

31:30.923 --> 31:33.257
(panting)

31:34.226 --> 31:36.727
(shuddering breath)

31:39.832 --> 31:41.565
(gasping breaths)

31:45.104 --> 31:46.236
(echoing scream)

31:54.546 --> 31:56.446
I tried to scream,
but nothing came out!

31:56.448 --> 31:58.048
Chad (crying):
Roger... Roger...

31:58.050 --> 31:59.516
And then he
was just gone!

31:59.518 --> 32:01.585
The red devil shot
roger in the head

32:01.587 --> 32:03.553
With the nail gun, and
then he just disappeared!

32:03.555 --> 32:05.889
Okay. Here's what we know.

32:05.891 --> 32:08.592
One-- number five is
a psychopath who no one likes.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.593
Two--

32:09.595 --> 32:11.028
She went in the closet

32:11.030 --> 32:13.263
To play seven minutes in
heaven with her boyfriend,

32:13.265 --> 32:14.698
And then he ends up dead!

32:14.700 --> 32:16.233
Clearly, chanel #5
is the killer!

32:16.235 --> 32:18.568
But when the dickie dollars
got attacked,

32:18.570 --> 32:21.104
And caulfield got his arms
chopped off...

32:21.106 --> 32:23.774
There were two devils.
<i>Dos diablos.</i>

32:23.776 --> 32:26.743
Okay, fine. Hester is
one of the killers,

32:26.745 --> 32:28.612
And the other
is chanel #5.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.914
Even though I firmly believe
the psychotic twin duo

32:30.916 --> 32:33.050
Of number five and number
six are the killers...

32:33.052 --> 32:34.284
Oh.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.786
...I have a
pressing question

32:35.788 --> 32:37.254
For haggie gyllenhaal.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.423
Isn't it interesting
that my former stalker

32:39.425 --> 32:41.758
And your current boyfriend pete
isn't here tonight?

32:41.760 --> 32:43.927
He told me
he was studying tonight.

32:43.929 --> 32:46.330
(groans)
he did. He told me
he was studying.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.431
Interesting.

32:47.433 --> 32:48.765
That's all I'm gonna say.

32:48.767 --> 32:49.933
Interesting.

32:49.935 --> 32:52.102
Chad (echoing):
Oh, dudes,

32:52.104 --> 32:53.937
There is a trapdoor

32:53.939 --> 32:55.339
With, like, a
tunnel system.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.007
See, chanel?
I wasn't lying.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.175
Zayday:
But wait, there
are secret tunnels

32:58.177 --> 33:00.477
In this house
perfect for a killer to use,

33:00.479 --> 33:02.312
And you neglected to tell us?

33:02.314 --> 33:03.814
That's a little suspicious.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.949
Okay, look. We are losing sight
of the big picture here.

33:05.951 --> 33:06.984
Chanel couldn't
have killed roger

33:06.986 --> 33:08.618
Because she was with us
when it happened.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.187
None of us killed him.
While chanel #5

33:10.189 --> 33:11.822
And roger were
in the closet,

33:11.824 --> 33:14.458
We were all together--
which means none of us did it.

33:14.460 --> 33:15.959
I'm going down there.
Are you crazy?!

33:15.961 --> 33:17.794
The red devil
could still be in the house.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.963
Both of the red devils
could still be in the house.

33:19.965 --> 33:21.665
Look, this house is
sealed up, right?

33:21.667 --> 33:23.834
Doors and windows locked.
So if none of us

33:23.836 --> 33:26.670
Is the killer, that tunnel
is how the red devil got in.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.271
That also means
it's our way out.

33:28.273 --> 33:29.806
Chad: I'm not
going down there.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.775
I do not dig on cobwebs,
and I'm guessing

33:31.777 --> 33:33.477
There are loads of
cobwebs down there.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.946
I'm going with her.

33:35.948 --> 33:37.647
We're copresidents
of this house

33:37.649 --> 33:40.417
And responsible for what
happens under this roof.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.121
(softly):
Chanel...

33:44.123 --> 33:46.323
If you get murdered
in those tunnels,

33:46.325 --> 33:49.793
I promise I will never bang
anyone harder than I banged you.

33:49.795 --> 33:50.627
Chad...

33:50.629 --> 33:51.528
Let's do this.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.131
I love you.
(pants)

33:54.133 --> 33:56.867
Oh... You're so rich and hot.

33:57.870 --> 34:00.370
(sighs)

34:09.214 --> 34:11.248
♪ ♪

34:17.556 --> 34:19.890
(sighs)

34:19.892 --> 34:22.893
These are the nicest
secret tunnels I've ever seen.

34:22.895 --> 34:24.895
These tunnels were
designed and decorated

34:24.897 --> 34:28.565
By founding kappa sister
madam cynthia rogers bouvet.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.168
She was the interior decorator
for both the cleveland

34:31.170 --> 34:33.770
And taft administrations.

34:40.112 --> 34:44.281
Chanel: She had affairs
with both of them.

34:44.283 --> 34:47.350
Rumor has it taft fell asleep
while mounting her

34:47.352 --> 34:50.754
And crushed her to death.

34:50.756 --> 34:53.056
These are all
past presidents.

34:53.058 --> 34:55.058
Marcy weiss--

34:55.060 --> 34:57.861
Kappa president
1928 to 1930.

34:57.863 --> 35:00.597
She helped kappa avoid the
misery of the great depression

35:00.599 --> 35:02.966
By kicking out any sister
whose family was affected

35:02.968 --> 35:05.535
By the crash of '29
and couldn't pay their dues.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.438
Wandy hart--

35:08.440 --> 35:10.440
Kappa president 1970.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.808
Personally responsible

35:11.810 --> 35:14.111
For crushing
the antiwar movement on campus

35:14.113 --> 35:17.581
By having the administration
ban macramé, fringed vests

35:17.583 --> 35:20.016
And creedence clearwater revival
songs.

35:20.986 --> 35:23.120
(sighs)
missy carmichael--

35:23.122 --> 35:25.288
Kappa president 1986.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.925
A pioneer in bringing
cocaine to kappa kappa tau.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.927
(takes deep breath)

35:30.929 --> 35:32.629
Wow. What amazing legacies

35:32.631 --> 35:33.930
They all have.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.899
What do you think ours will be?

35:35.901 --> 35:38.568
If we can get through this year
without everyone getting killed,

35:38.570 --> 35:41.171
I think we'll go down
as the greatest of them all.

35:42.441 --> 35:43.306
(gasps)

35:49.314 --> 35:50.847
(gasps, screams)

35:52.084 --> 35:52.949

35:52.951 --> 35:54.518

(creaking)

36:25.184 --> 36:27.250
(panting)

36:30.355 --> 36:33.056
You came back for me.
Purely selfish.

36:33.058 --> 36:36.259
If I'm gonna survive this thing,
I'm gonna need the numbers.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.035
Don't you see that
all the killings

36:45.037 --> 36:46.836
Have been about kappa?
Well, except for coney,

36:46.838 --> 36:48.572
But he was just
irritating.
(sirens wailing)

36:48.574 --> 36:50.740
Yeah, that's becoming
pretty obvious.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.042
Jennifer:
You are probably

36:52.044 --> 36:53.810
The worst cop ever.

36:53.812 --> 36:56.079
(ringtone plays)
we're pretty much gonna focus

36:56.081 --> 36:58.248
All of our attention
on protecting this house.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.382
I'm gonna have
uniformed officers

36:59.384 --> 37:00.917
Posted outside 24/7.

37:00.919 --> 37:03.420
That is fantastic news.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.055
What's fantastic?

37:05.057 --> 37:06.756
Come on.

37:06.758 --> 37:09.926
You and I both know that
that lesbian was cannon fodder.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.094
And think about it.

37:11.096 --> 37:12.929
What kind of life
was that guy gonna live

37:12.931 --> 37:15.065
With no arms, really?

37:15.067 --> 37:17.234
They were
but a small price to pay

37:17.236 --> 37:20.036
For the knowledge
that I can now place a robocall

37:20.038 --> 37:23.607
To every parent and student
at this university saying

37:23.609 --> 37:27.611
That as long as they are not a
sister of, pledging, or sleeping

37:27.613 --> 37:31.114
With someone from kappa house,
they are safe

37:31.116 --> 37:33.350
To resume
normal school activities.

37:33.352 --> 37:34.417
Wes:
Grace.

37:34.419 --> 37:37.387
Dad, hi.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.389
Oh, thank god. (sighs)
hi.

37:39.391 --> 37:42.259
What's wrong?
Grace. Come on.

37:42.261 --> 37:43.727
Wait, where are we going?

37:43.729 --> 37:45.095
Out of here.

37:45.097 --> 37:48.031
No, dad, I'm not leaving.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.567
Not now. Not when my
sisters need me the most.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.936
Your sisters are getting
picked off like ducks on a pond!

37:52.938 --> 37:54.271
I won't go!

37:54.273 --> 37:55.872
And you can't make me.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.041
In three seconds,

37:58.043 --> 38:00.710
I'm gonna pick you up
and carry you out of here.

38:00.712 --> 38:01.778
Do you understand me?

38:01.780 --> 38:02.779
Zayday:
I don't think so,

38:02.781 --> 38:05.115
Dad. You're a good man,

38:05.117 --> 38:07.117
And I love the way you love her.

38:07.119 --> 38:09.052
But if sister
wants to stay,

38:09.054 --> 38:10.186
She's staying.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.926
Oh. Um, I-I just
kind of came over here

38:16.928 --> 38:19.029
Because I farted over there
and it smelled bad.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.602
Okay.

38:25.604 --> 38:28.104
Dad.

38:28.106 --> 38:30.106
Dad, can...
(door slams)

38:30.108 --> 38:32.042
(sighs)

38:34.479 --> 38:37.480
I'm sorry about roger.
Or dodger.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.316
Well, both.

38:39.318 --> 38:40.850
Thanks.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.619
I'm sorry about sam.

38:42.621 --> 38:44.287
Thanks.

38:44.289 --> 38:46.122
I miss her.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.290
I loved her.

38:47.292 --> 38:49.793
Her tattoos and
the way she wore

38:49.795 --> 38:52.962
That hat
without any irony at all.

38:52.964 --> 38:55.298
She awakened
a deep sexual honesty in me

38:55.300 --> 38:57.600
That, up until now,
I was afraid to admit.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.102
Wait, you're a lesbian?

38:59.104 --> 39:01.104
No. At first,
my feelings

39:01.106 --> 39:02.706
For sam made me think I was.

39:02.708 --> 39:05.709
But then, in that moment,
when I kissed her,

39:05.711 --> 39:08.378
I realized I didn't care
if she was a girl or a guy.

39:08.380 --> 39:11.381
Basically, I'm in
love with love.

39:11.383 --> 39:13.383
And sam dying
taught me that...

39:13.385 --> 39:16.720
The next time I feel love for
someone, I'm going to tell them.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.722
Right away.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.557
Just in case they're murdered
before I can.

39:20.559 --> 39:23.293
It was like her final gift
to you.

39:23.295 --> 39:25.295
That's a nice way
of thinking about it.

39:25.297 --> 39:27.397
Makes me feel a little less
guilty about condemning her

39:27.399 --> 39:29.666
To die by daring her to go
down to the basement alone.

39:29.668 --> 39:33.536
I'd always felt like I'd won the
lottery with roger and dodger.

39:33.538 --> 39:34.704
I mean,
I never thought

39:34.706 --> 39:36.339
They'd both get killed.

39:36.341 --> 39:38.541
What are the chances, right?
I just feel
like

39:38.543 --> 39:39.976
I'm never gonna find a guy
who likes me.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.746
Let alone two
who look exactly alike.

39:42.748 --> 39:43.980
I'm a freak.

39:43.982 --> 39:46.182
I mean, the only reason
I'm in this house

39:46.184 --> 39:48.518
Is 'cause I'm a legacy.
(sighs)

39:48.520 --> 39:50.653
Nobody actually likes me.

39:50.655 --> 39:52.422
Chanel has
the whole campus convinced

39:52.424 --> 39:55.058
That my vagina
has teeth.

39:55.060 --> 39:58.728
You are totally gonna
find another guy.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.930
You're super cute,
and you're a kappa.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.700
And I'm sure there's some
awesome dude out there

40:03.702 --> 40:05.602
Who will accept you for who you
are, vaginal teeth and all.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.704
Thanks.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.706
And let's make a pact.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.374
No matter what happens,

40:11.376 --> 40:13.243
No matter what dignity
we have to sacrifice,

40:13.245 --> 40:14.911
What laws we have to break,

40:14.913 --> 40:17.180
What bodies we
have to step over,

40:17.182 --> 40:20.417
You and I are going
to outlive chanel.

40:20.419 --> 40:21.418
Deal?

40:22.421 --> 40:24.053
Deal.

40:24.055 --> 40:26.723
Chanel:
<i>Pledges and sisters</i>

40:26.725 --> 40:29.192
Of kappa house, thanks to me,

40:29.194 --> 40:30.894
You've all survived
yet another attack

40:30.896 --> 40:32.629
From the red devil killer.

40:32.631 --> 40:35.398
Once again,
death came to kappa house,

40:35.400 --> 40:37.600
And once again that death,
while tragic,

40:37.602 --> 40:39.436
Has brought us all
closer together.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.271
I even kind of like zayday now.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.306
And I got gifts.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.144
Jennifer:
Giant, pink

40:48.146 --> 40:49.446
Chopsticks.

40:49.448 --> 40:52.115
No. They're custom-made
pink nunchaku.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.117
Oh.
If I can impart anything

40:54.119 --> 40:56.252
On you slits
over the course of this year,

40:56.254 --> 40:59.222
It's that kappas don't take
any crap from anyone.

40:59.224 --> 41:01.591
Guys, I joined this sorority
to feel close to my mom,

41:01.593 --> 41:04.260
To get a taste of the sisterhood
that she was so inspired by.

41:04.262 --> 41:06.463
And after last night,
I really feel it.

41:06.465 --> 41:08.932
I'm with you guys,
no matter what.
(chuckles)

41:08.934 --> 41:10.099
Thank you for making
that announcement

41:10.101 --> 41:11.267
That no one cared about.

41:11.269 --> 41:14.103
Now, I pledge
that from this night on,

41:14.105 --> 41:15.605
We will not lose
any more of our sisters.

41:15.607 --> 41:16.906
How are you gonna
do that?

41:16.908 --> 41:18.775
We are gonna take the fight
to him.

41:18.777 --> 41:21.244
I will not rest
until we have the red devil

41:21.246 --> 41:24.280
Or red devils' heads on spikes
on the front lawn of this house.

41:24.282 --> 41:26.783
Well, that's
all well and good,

41:26.785 --> 41:28.918
But we all know that it was

41:28.920 --> 41:30.620
My slumber party idea
that made this whole

41:30.622 --> 41:32.956
"'we are the world' hands
across america" stuff happen.

41:32.958 --> 41:35.959
And we never got to
appropriately finish said party.

41:35.961 --> 41:37.794
Now, I don't know
about you guys,

41:37.796 --> 41:39.796
But in o-town,

41:39.798 --> 41:41.598
No slumber party is finished

41:41.600 --> 41:43.600
Without a kickass dance party.

41:43.602 --> 41:45.301
(beep)
what, what?!

41:45.303 --> 41:48.037
(modern english's
"I melt with you" playing)
(girls whooping)

41:51.276 --> 41:53.776
This is
so wonderfully random.

41:53.778 --> 41:55.478
I know.
What a great way to pretend

41:55.480 --> 41:57.647
All these people we know
weren't brutally murdered.

41:57.649 --> 42:00.950
♪ there's nothing
you and I won't do ♪
chanel: Stop.

42:00.952 --> 42:06.022
Hester: Kappa...!
♪ I'll stop the world
and melt with you. ♪
