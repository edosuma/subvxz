00:37.440 --> 00:38.839
Your turn to crank it.

00:39.239 --> 00:42.559
-Watcha doin'?
-Making homemade ice cream

00:42.720 --> 00:45.600
in our new... ice-cream maker.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.040
-Your turn!
-Homemade is...

00:48.199 --> 00:50.640
so much better than... store bought.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.879
Also slower. A lot... slower.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.040
It's totally worth... the extra work.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.239
Take a look at this!

01:02.559 --> 01:03.559
What?

01:03.680 --> 01:05.759
It's not as frozen
as I thought it would be.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.720
It's not frozen at all!

01:07.880 --> 01:09.360
It's ice-cream soup!

01:09.479 --> 01:10.600
[slurps]

01:11.000 --> 01:13.840
But we followed the instructions exactly!

01:14.000 --> 01:15.160
"Mix the cream and sugar,

01:15.280 --> 01:17.520
turn the crank, enjoy your ice cream."

01:18.880 --> 01:20.560
What did we do wrong?

01:20.720 --> 01:25.280
I don't know. But my cousin
Tucci in Italy could tell you.

01:25.399 --> 01:28.160
-Why? Is he really smart?
-No.

01:28.280 --> 01:31.640
But he makes gelato.
You know, Italian ice cream.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.360
In fact, he was looking
to create a new flavour called...

01:36.679 --> 01:39.280
"Best Friends Gelato."

01:39.560 --> 01:41.759
Ollie, I'm having a brainstorm!

01:41.920 --> 01:44.560
Uh-oh. When you have a brainstorm,

01:44.720 --> 01:46.360
I get dragged off somewhere.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.520
But, Ollie, we're best friends.

01:48.679 --> 01:52.280
We could help Tucci create
his new Best Friends flavour!

01:52.440 --> 01:53.520
Well...

01:53.640 --> 01:56.720
Then maybe he'd show us
how to make gelato ice cream!

01:57.000 --> 01:58.960
No more soup!

01:59.080 --> 02:02.320
My arm <i>is </i>pretty tired
from all that cranking.

02:02.479 --> 02:04.759
OK. Just let me get my travel bag.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.080
Hmm.

02:07.679 --> 02:08.880
Ready...

02:09.440 --> 02:10.600
Go!

02:20.400 --> 02:21.400
Whoo!

02:22.160 --> 02:23.799
Whee!

02:30.640 --> 02:33.880
We're going to make the best
Best Friends gelato ever!

02:34.040 --> 02:35.280
You know why?

02:35.440 --> 02:38.079
Because we're the best best friends ever!

02:38.600 --> 02:41.200
<i>Now arriving in Italy!</i>

02:41.320 --> 02:42.680
<i>Yay!</i>

02:49.000 --> 02:50.359
Whoa!

02:50.519 --> 02:53.920
Isn't Italy <i>magnifico</i>?

02:54.519 --> 02:56.280
Just look at all these twisty streets!

02:56.760 --> 02:59.600
We'll be lucky to find
Tucci's shop even with a map!

02:59.720 --> 03:03.320
No maps, Ollie. It takes all
the fun out of getting places!

03:03.440 --> 03:06.959
-But I love maps!
-But I don't love maps!

03:07.079 --> 03:08.400
Stop kidding, Moon.

03:08.519 --> 03:11.399
You're my best friend!
You gotta love what I love!

03:11.600 --> 03:13.560
OK. We'll follow the map.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.519
But I get to make it fun, OK?

03:15.679 --> 03:17.920
-Sounds OK.
-That's fair.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.840
Hey! I was gonna use that!

03:31.040 --> 03:31.920
Is this fun?

03:32.920 --> 03:36.079
-Are we having fun?
-Yes!

03:42.000 --> 03:42.920
Aw...

03:43.679 --> 03:44.760
Yeah-ha!

03:44.920 --> 03:46.000
[gasps]

03:47.519 --> 03:51.079
Sorry, Ollie.
You still want to follow the map?

03:51.399 --> 03:53.560
Oh, look at you with your back-up map.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.679
Best Friends gelato, here we come.

03:56.799 --> 03:59.760
Wait. Ollie, look! A gondola!

03:59.880 --> 04:02.880
-We love gondolas!
-We do?

04:05.280 --> 04:09.040
Now this is how to find
Tucci's gelato shop!

04:09.160 --> 04:11.799
We'll just cruise around till we spot it.

04:11.920 --> 04:15.119
Don't we just love gondola boats, Ollie?

04:15.239 --> 04:18.120
No, Moon. We do not love boats.

04:18.279 --> 04:21.800
What? We're best friends.
We totally love boats!

04:21.920 --> 04:24.800
Actually, on boats... we get a little...

04:25.960 --> 04:27.920
Really? Are you sure?

04:28.680 --> 04:29.840
He's sure.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.640
Whoa!

04:33.800 --> 04:35.479
Whoa!

04:38.039 --> 04:42.080
There. Now we feel much better.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.200
No kidding! Look, it's Tucci's shop!

04:45.360 --> 04:47.360
It's Best Friends gelato time.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.560
Wow!

04:53.039 --> 04:55.760
Come on, Moon!
Let's go this way, past the pigeons!

04:55.919 --> 04:57.560
-They're so fun!
-Mmm.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.840
No. Let's go that way!

05:02.960 --> 05:04.599
Pigeons are so...

05:06.320 --> 05:07.520
oogie.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.479
Let's go!

05:13.280 --> 05:16.120
-Stanley!
-Tucci!

05:16.240 --> 05:19.400
So, these are the best friends
you've been telling me about?

05:19.520 --> 05:22.800
-You bet they are!
-Yep! We agree on everything!

05:22.919 --> 05:25.440
-Except maps.
-And boats.

05:25.599 --> 05:27.200
[both] And pigeons.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.880
But other than those little,
tiny, non-gelato-related things,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.800
they're best friends forever!

05:32.919 --> 05:35.479
Then let's make some ice cream!

05:38.919 --> 05:40.120
First, we add the...

05:40.280 --> 05:41.719
-Vanilla!
-Sun-dried tomato!

05:41.880 --> 05:43.200
[gasps]
What?

05:43.320 --> 05:45.320
But that's not a dessert flavour!

05:45.440 --> 05:48.520
Hmm! But that's so boring!
Just looking at it is...

05:48.640 --> 05:50.120
[yawns]

05:50.280 --> 05:51.400
...making me yawn!

05:51.520 --> 05:54.680
Our gelato needs to be sweet and simple,

05:54.800 --> 05:55.640
with vanilla.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.400
Our flavour needs pizzazz,

05:57.520 --> 05:59.320
with sun-dried tomahto!

05:59.440 --> 06:00.320
You mean, tomato?

06:00.440 --> 06:02.200
-Tomahto.
-Tomato!

06:02.320 --> 06:04.200
-Tomahto!
-Tomato!

06:04.359 --> 06:05.560
Tomahto!

06:05.760 --> 06:07.840
-I can't do this!
-This is hopeless!

06:08.599 --> 06:09.520
[gasp]

06:09.640 --> 06:12.680
We don't like any of the same things.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.919
Not the way best friends are supposed to!

06:16.240 --> 06:19.080
Then I guess we can't be
best friends any more.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.680
-I guess not. So long, Moon.
-Goodbye, Ollie.

06:22.919 --> 06:24.919
But they're the best friends ever!

06:25.039 --> 06:28.440
Mamma mia!
We have to get them back together!

06:28.560 --> 06:30.400
In the name of friendship!

06:32.280 --> 06:33.799
And... business.

06:33.919 --> 06:36.599
-I still need my gelato.
-Then what are we waiting for?

06:36.719 --> 06:39.240
Let's hustle! Let's move! Let's hurry!

06:45.280 --> 06:47.400
I can't believe Moon doesn't like this!

06:47.520 --> 06:49.840
She has no idea what she's missing.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.280
[chuckles]

06:51.400 --> 06:55.719
This is so great!
I can't believe Ollie's not into it!

06:56.680 --> 06:58.520
Tucci, you ready? Over.

06:58.640 --> 07:02.320
Operation "Friends Forever" is a go. Over.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.919
It's actually a good thing
Moon's not here.

07:05.039 --> 07:08.080
She'd just be making yuck faces
at you guys anyway.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.239
Nope. I don't need...

07:14.760 --> 07:16.320
[pop]

07:16.440 --> 07:17.599
Hmm?

07:19.120 --> 07:20.440
Huh? Moon?

07:22.960 --> 07:25.960
What a fantastic time
I'm having by myself,

07:26.799 --> 07:27.799
without a best friend!

07:28.400 --> 07:30.640
I am so much better off without...

07:32.120 --> 07:33.440
Ollie?

07:33.719 --> 07:36.000
"Friends Forever", phase two?

07:40.960 --> 07:43.960
I have to stop thinking about Moon.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.599
And what she's doing.

07:45.719 --> 07:47.200
And what kind of wild brainstorms

07:47.320 --> 07:49.039
she's having without me!

07:50.599 --> 07:53.760
Nope. I'm not going
to think about her any more.

07:53.919 --> 07:56.280
I'm just going to have fun
with my pigeon friends.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.359
-Right, guys?
-Moon!

07:59.479 --> 08:01.840
Moon?

08:02.000 --> 08:05.400
Oh, I miss Moon! I really do!

08:06.159 --> 08:07.599
What a pretty green boat.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.679
It's the same colour
as Ollie's little face

08:09.840 --> 08:13.120
when he gets seasick. Aw!

08:14.599 --> 08:16.400
I've got to stop thinking about...

08:16.560 --> 08:19.120
Ollie!

08:19.280 --> 08:22.120

we had to agree on everything
to be best friends.
