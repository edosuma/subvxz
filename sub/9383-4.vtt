Lois, you are a wonderful woman.

11:17.094 --> 11:21.139
Words cannot express the depth
of my appreciation and love for you.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.432
Peter!

11:29.523 --> 11:31.191
You must be Lois.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.906
No, not silicone. Silicon.
And the design of the device...

11:37.990 --> 11:41.869
...is quite ingenious
if I do say so myself, Misty.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.162
What a delightful moniker.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.832
You see, Misty...

11:46.915 --> 11:48.041
[Stewie giggles]

11:48.125 --> 11:50.544
...my time manipulator employs axioms...

11:50.627 --> 11:53.881
...from the quantum theory
of molecular propulsion.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.924
I've broken my pencil!

11:56.175 --> 11:58.427
I have a Barney pen in my purse.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.055
You are spectacular!

12:05.184 --> 12:06.768
Chris, what are you doing here?

12:06.852 --> 12:09.646
Sorry, Mom.
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.690
Chris, go to your room!

12:12.900 --> 12:14.693
Hello, Mother. Care to partake in one...

12:14.776 --> 12:18.280
...of your oh-so-exhilarating games
of peekaboo?

12:18.655 --> 12:20.991
Oh, my God! My baby is drunk!

12:21.283 --> 12:22.534
PETER: No, I'm not!

12:22.618 --> 12:24.411
Him? Yeah. He's a real lightweight.

Peter, in the 17 years
that we've been married...

12:34.630 --> 12:37.132
...I have never been as angry as I....

12:37.925 --> 12:40.010
What is my piano doing down here?

12:40.093 --> 12:43.388
It was supposed to be a clam cake buffet,
but.... Never mind.

12:43.472 --> 12:47.017
That does it, Peter.
Either this bar goes or I do!

12:47.267 --> 12:50.854
PETER: I haven't even told you
the other reason your piano's down here.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.023
I wanted you to play it.

12:54.525 --> 12:58.654
Like it was an instrument.
I'm telling you the truth. Right, guys?

12:59.363 --> 13:00.656
Come on!

13:00.739 --> 13:01.949
I couldn't.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.408
Come on!

13:03.617 --> 13:05.285
Maybe one song.

Something troubling you, Peter?

You're so observant, aren't you?
Are you a detective?

Mom says she was really on last night.

14:40.797 --> 14:44.510
Yeah. About that. Lois, see,
the guys were just being polite.

14:44.593 --> 14:46.845
They thought your singing was too....

14:46.929 --> 14:49.640
I was just nervous. Tonight'll be better.

Or do you?

15:33.642 --> 15:34.768
"Or do you?"

Now that I'm a free man,
we can do anything we want.

If Lois were my woman,
I'd keep an eye on her.

Then again, I'm the jealous type.

Nice melons.

If I wanted to marry Lola Falana,
I would have.

16:19.313 --> 16:22.608
Look, Lola. This whole thing
is just going way too fast for me.

16:22.691 --> 16:25.944
For the last time, I'm not Lola!
I'm Leslie Uggams!

16:26.028 --> 16:29.072
Peter, having me sing was your idea
in the first place.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.158
I just wanted to keep my bar.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.743
I built that thing so my friends...

16:32.826 --> 16:34.578
...would come to see me, not you.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.289
Is that so? Let me tell you something.

16:37.372 --> 16:40.375
I love singing!
And I will continue to sing!
