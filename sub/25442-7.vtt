00:04.380 --> 00:06.750
Raven's Home was filmed
in front of a live
studio audience.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.040
(stomach growls)

00:10.040 --> 00:12.420
Oh, calm down, sweetheart.

00:12.420 --> 00:13.830
Chelsea just texted me,

00:13.830 --> 00:15.500
and she's gonna
bring us a little treat!

00:15.500 --> 00:17.170
Okay!

00:17.170 --> 00:18.830
Look what we brought you, Rae!

00:18.830 --> 00:20.460
A prickly little treat!

00:23.460 --> 00:24.620
Are you serious, Chels?

00:24.620 --> 00:26.250
You can't call
anything a treat

00:26.250 --> 00:28.330
unless it has cheese
and whipped cream on it!

00:28.330 --> 00:29.960
I told you.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.420
Hey, listen, they're cacti
from my garden!

00:33.420 --> 00:35.540
You know, it's a little treat
for the apartment.

00:35.540 --> 00:37.460
You know what else would be
a treat for the apartment?

00:37.460 --> 00:40.460
Yes, I know, Rae!
Apple pie with cheese
and whipped cream.

00:40.460 --> 00:41.960
No. You paying half the rent

00:41.960 --> 00:43.330
with cheese
and whipped cream on it!

00:44.960 --> 00:46.540
Hey, look what I did!

00:46.540 --> 00:48.830
(gasps)
Wow, Rae!

00:48.830 --> 00:51.330
You really captured the essence
of your subject.

00:51.330 --> 00:53.670
-Thank you.
-I don't know where you
get your inspiration.

00:54.620 --> 00:56.000
Auntie Rae,

00:56.000 --> 00:57.380
can we get this over with?

00:57.380 --> 00:58.710
This thing's hot.

00:58.710 --> 00:59.830
Sit, Levi! Sit!

01:02.000 --> 01:03.170
-Mom!
-Yes?

01:03.170 --> 01:04.420
Check this out!

The Lit 'Fit Fashion Blog
says I need

01:05.960 --> 01:07.710
this jacket in my life.

01:07.710 --> 01:09.040
(scoffs)

01:09.040 --> 01:11.540
You gonna spend
$150 on a jacket?!

01:13.420 --> 01:14.920
Booker, mind your business.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.120
(scoffs)

01:16.120 --> 01:19.210
You gonna spend
$150 on a jacket?!

01:19.210 --> 01:20.880
Yes, Mom!

01:20.880 --> 01:23.460
I want to set
the trends at school,
not follow them!

01:23.460 --> 01:25.210
Besides, it's my money.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.920
Shouldn't I be able to
spend it how I want to?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.080
Nia, you have been
saving that money

01:29.080 --> 01:31.460
to go to the African-American
History Museum in DC.

01:31.460 --> 01:34.830
I'm not gonna
let you just blow it
on some jacket,

01:34.830 --> 01:36.960
so you can be the
"It" girl at school!

01:36.960 --> 01:40.080
Yeah! I've been saving
for the same trip,

01:40.080 --> 01:42.540
and I'd never waste my money
on something dumb like--

01:42.540 --> 01:44.460
Oh! I want that!

01:46.420 --> 01:49.250
A two-sided game table?

01:49.250 --> 01:51.540
Aw, man! Mitch gets
all the awesome stuff

01:51.540 --> 01:53.330
craned up to his penthouse.

01:54.580 --> 01:55.750
Okay, come here,
come here. Listen.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.670
We are not crane people.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.460
That money
is for your DC trip.

02:02.460 --> 02:05.080
Now neither of you are allowed
to spend it on jackets,

02:05.080 --> 02:07.250
or games
or any of that nonsense.

02:07.250 --> 02:09.620
-You're right, Mom.
-Okay. I got it, Mom.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.500
So, did you ask your mom

02:12.500 --> 02:14.000
if you could spend
your money on the jacket?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.420
She said I couldn't get it!

02:16.420 --> 02:18.170

Nia! You know you can't
take this jacket back.

03:14.380 --> 03:16.580
It's final sale.
No returns.

03:16.580 --> 03:19.460
I know, but that DC trip
isn't for two whole months.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.250
That's plenty of time
to save up the money again.

03:22.790 --> 03:26.540
That's why I'm going
to enjoy wearing this...

03:26.540 --> 03:28.250
whenever my mom's not around.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.460
Raven:
Nia!

03:29.460 --> 03:30.790
-She's around!
-(Nia gasps) Quick!

03:32.790 --> 03:33.880
Hey, Ni-- Oh!

03:35.120 --> 03:36.670
Oh, why are you in bed?

03:36.670 --> 03:38.250
Just doing some homework.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.750
-What kinda homework?
-Criminal science!

03:40.750 --> 03:42.580
She's... undercover!

03:44.120 --> 03:45.670
And I'm...

03:45.670 --> 03:47.120
leaving the scene
of the crime.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.750
Not that there
was a crime! Bye!

03:51.960 --> 03:53.250
-Nia, listen.
-Yes?

03:53.250 --> 03:54.790
I have been thinking
about that money

03:54.790 --> 03:55.880
you want to spend on the jacket

03:55.880 --> 03:56.960
that you've been eyeing.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.000
-Yeah?
-Then how about this?

03:59.000 --> 04:02.080
On Monday,
we take all of your money,

04:02.080 --> 04:03.670
and put it in the bank.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.330
Right?!
So you and Booker can learn

04:07.330 --> 04:09.790
how to be responsible
with your money. Exciting!

04:09.790 --> 04:13.040
Thrilling.
Now, if you will excuse me,

04:13.040 --> 04:15.250
I'm gonna get back to my
criminal science homework.

04:15.250 --> 04:16.920
Okay, okay.

04:18.380 --> 04:19.880
You know what I think, Nia?

04:19.880 --> 04:22.420
-I think you're guilty.
-I am?

04:22.420 --> 04:23.620
Yeah.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.540
Of being a good daughter.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.170
Thanks, Mom.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.830
-Bye, Mom.
-(Raven giggles)

04:31.830 --> 04:32.880
(door closes)

04:34.330 --> 04:36.120
I'm so bad.

04:37.420 --> 04:39.000
But I look so good!

04:43.080 --> 04:44.120
(knocking)

04:47.920 --> 04:49.580
What do you want, Mitch?

04:49.580 --> 04:51.580
You probably saw
the really cool stuff

04:51.580 --> 04:53.290
being lifted
past your window.

04:53.290 --> 04:54.790
How could we miss it?

04:54.790 --> 04:56.420
One of those boxes said,

04:56.420 --> 04:57.580
"Hey Booker and Levi,

04:57.580 --> 04:58.880
"look at all the
really cool stuff

04:58.880 --> 05:00.500
being lifted
past your window."

05:01.750 --> 05:02.960
Did it?

05:02.960 --> 05:04.750
(laughs)
Of course it did!

05:06.790 --> 05:09.170
Well, you wanna come up
and check it out?

05:09.170 --> 05:10.710
Ha! Oh.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.790
I may be able to
work that into my, uh,

05:12.790 --> 05:14.000
"shed-you-el."

05:16.920 --> 05:18.420
What are you doing?

05:18.420 --> 05:20.920
I'm pronouncing "schedule"

05:20.920 --> 05:22.290
in a really cool way.

05:22.290 --> 05:24.290
Okay, first of all,
you're not.

05:25.620 --> 05:26.710
And secondly,

05:26.710 --> 05:28.000
I'm talking about Mitch!

05:28.000 --> 05:29.710
Every time we trust this guy,

05:29.710 --> 05:31.790
it turns out,
we can't trust this guy!

05:31.790 --> 05:34.670
But-- but he's got a
two-sided game table!

05:34.670 --> 05:36.580
We don't even have one side!

05:42.670 --> 05:43.670
Go, go, go!

05:47.880 --> 05:50.080
Sorry, Mitch.
No can do!

05:50.080 --> 05:51.580
What?!

05:51.580 --> 05:53.750
It doesn't fit into
your "shed-you-el?"

05:56.670 --> 05:58.380
Whatever, losers.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.250
But you're gonna regret it.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.210
You did the right thing, Booker.

06:08.580 --> 06:10.580
(whooshing)

06:13.250 --> 06:14.500
(whooshing)

06:17.880 --> 06:19.460
I-- I don't think I did.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.170
I just had a vision!

06:21.170 --> 06:23.250
I saw me as a doll!

06:24.540 --> 06:26.120
Mitch is gonna
do some kind of...

06:27.540 --> 06:29.210
some kinda Mitch-craft on me!

06:35.040 --> 06:37.830
Mitch said we were gonna
regret not playing with him.

06:37.830 --> 06:41.120
Now he's gonna do some
doll hocus-pocus on me!

06:41.120 --> 06:43.750
Booker, I'm sure
there's another explanation

06:43.750 --> 06:44.880
for your vision.

06:44.880 --> 06:45.670
Ow!

06:47.040 --> 06:49.120
Then why did something
just poke me?

06:49.120 --> 06:50.580
What could have poked you?

06:50.580 --> 06:52.380
How about the needle
Mitch is poking

06:52.380 --> 06:54.460
into that little
Booker doll?

06:54.460 --> 06:56.880
This is how it starts, Levi!

06:56.880 --> 06:58.920
A little poke.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.580
Next thing you know,
there are snakes in my locker,

07:01.580 --> 07:03.920
and I got warm
tuna fish for lunch!

07:03.920 --> 07:05.620
Get a hold of yourself, man!

07:05.620 --> 07:07.830
2You're right, you're right.

07:07.830 --> 07:09.750
Here you go, Booker.
You forgot your lunch.

07:13.880 --> 07:14.880
It's tuna fish.

07:17.290 --> 07:19.080
And it's warm!

07:20.250 --> 07:22.120
It's happening, Levi!

07:22.120 --> 07:23.170
It's happening!

07:24.710 --> 07:25.750
It's happening.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.330
Check it out.

07:28.330 --> 07:30.670
Tess:
Everybody's noticing
the jacket.

07:30.670 --> 07:32.960
I'm gonna give 'em a little
taste of what they want,

07:32.960 --> 07:35.750
but I'm not gonna
make it look planned.

07:41.710 --> 07:42.920
Hey, guys.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.170
Check out Nia's jacket.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.250
Way to work it!

07:46.250 --> 07:47.830
That didn't
look planned at all.

07:49.250 --> 07:50.330
Wow, Nia!

07:50.330 --> 07:51.500
Great jacket!

07:51.500 --> 07:52.880
You really know your fashion.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.210
Wait, how'd you
get that so fast?

07:55.210 --> 07:56.920
It just popped up
on Lit 'Fits.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.620
Well, Zeena,
real trendsetters

07:58.620 --> 07:59.790
have "Lit 'Fits" premium.

07:59.790 --> 08:01.670
Oh, premium!

08:04.960 --> 08:06.500
I'd do anything to wear that.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.710
Would you give us
a second, please?

08:10.920 --> 08:13.580
Tess, Sienna said she'd
do anything to wear this.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.000
I get it.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.420
You're worried
she's gonna steal it!

08:16.420 --> 08:18.710
Hurry! Zip it up
before she grabs it.

08:18.710 --> 08:20.790
I'm thinking
I could rent it to her

08:20.790 --> 08:21.920
and all those other kids.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.210
That way I can
make my money back,

08:23.210 --> 08:24.710
and get it to the bank
on Monday!

08:24.710 --> 08:26.290
A fashion rental business.

08:26.290 --> 08:27.920
Good call, but first,

08:27.920 --> 08:29.290
we need a cool company name.

08:29.290 --> 08:30.670
Oh, yeah.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.040
I got it!

08:32.040 --> 08:34.710
"Jacket" spelled with
a "G" instead of a "J."

08:35.880 --> 08:38.380
That would make it...
"Gacket."

08:39.540 --> 08:40.790
Even better!

08:42.920 --> 08:45.000
All right, who wants
to wear this jacket

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
for five minutes for $5.00?

08:47.000 --> 08:47.790
Yeah.

08:52.710 --> 08:54.830
Hey! I know you.

08:54.830 --> 08:56.290
Last time you picked me up,

08:56.290 --> 08:57.830
you left the window down,

08:57.830 --> 08:59.120
and Carmichael
jumped out,

08:59.120 --> 09:01.710
and nearly got killed
chasing that falcon!

09:01.710 --> 09:03.960
Oh! Well, he looks like

09:03.960 --> 09:06.210
he got about eight lives left.
He'll be good.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.290
Do you mind if I ask you
about your pet portraits?

09:11.290 --> 09:12.670
Why would you ask that?

09:12.670 --> 09:13.960
'Cause this book says,

09:13.960 --> 09:15.880
"Ask Me About
My Pet Portraits."

09:15.880 --> 09:17.670
(laughs)

09:17.670 --> 09:20.830
Oh, my friend Chelsea
must have put that in here!

09:20.830 --> 09:23.120
Painting is just a hobby.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.540
Oh!

09:24.540 --> 09:26.750
-They're quite good!
-Thank you.

09:26.750 --> 09:30.080
I'll give you $500
for a portrait of my cat.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.670
You got a crayon?
I'll do that right now!

09:39.000 --> 09:40.290
What a day, huh?

09:40.290 --> 09:42.670
Gacket was a great idea!

09:43.670 --> 09:45.790
Still not feeling the name,

09:45.790 --> 09:48.040
but thank you!
I made all of my money back.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.960
Good, so now you'll have
the deposit for Monday,
and you're done.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.920
Done? No, no.
I'm just getting started!

09:54.920 --> 09:57.960
Tess, people
are depending on me
to tell them what's next,

09:57.960 --> 10:00.000
and that's definitely...

10:00.000 --> 10:02.290
the matching cape.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.120
-Whoa!
-Mm-hmm.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.120
Wait. How much
did this cost you?

10:06.120 --> 10:08.290
Fashion has no price.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.420
$150.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.960
But don't worry!
We'll rent them both out
and make twice the money.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.960
Ah, see?

10:17.960 --> 10:20.880
This is why you're
the president of Gacket.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.080
You know what?

10:24.080 --> 10:25.420
I'm starting to feel the name!

10:25.420 --> 10:27.000
-Yes, give me the jacket!
-Yes!

10:27.000 --> 10:28.920
I bought all this stuff

10:28.920 --> 10:31.080
this old book
of spell remedies
told me to get

10:31.080 --> 10:33.040
to stop Mitch's hocus-pocus.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.210
Sage.

10:35.960 --> 10:36.960
Garlic.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.040
And a mini pie?

10:42.330 --> 10:44.120
What does mini pie stop?

10:44.120 --> 10:45.000
Hunger.

10:47.210 --> 10:48.790
You could've bought two.

10:48.790 --> 10:50.080
I did.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.790
(mumbles)
It was a long walk home.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.460
Booker, how much
did all this cost?

10:56.460 --> 10:58.620
-$20.
-That's not so bad.

10:58.620 --> 10:59.710
It was all I had left

10:59.710 --> 11:01.330
after I spent $130

11:01.330 --> 11:02.880
on this spell remedy book.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.040
You spent all your money?

11:06.040 --> 11:08.000
What about the bank on Monday?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.040
Ow!

11:09.960 --> 11:11.830
Another poke!

11:11.830 --> 11:13.830
If I don't stop Mitch,

11:13.830 --> 11:15.330
I may not be here Monday.

11:17.380 --> 11:18.710
Three pies?

11:18.710 --> 11:21.080
Didn't you just hear me?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.830
I may not be here Monday!

11:30.210 --> 11:31.000
Ooh!

11:32.460 --> 11:33.670
Ahh!

11:34.710 --> 11:36.000
I don't know
what feels better.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.920
The oohs or the ahhs.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.500
Right. We should
take these off,

11:39.500 --> 11:41.290
and open up Gacket
for business.

11:41.290 --> 11:43.540
Or we can wear them
for the rest of the day

11:43.540 --> 11:45.580
and upgrade those
oohs and ahhs

11:45.580 --> 11:47.830
to wows and whoas.

11:47.830 --> 11:50.620
But what about making
your money back?

11:50.620 --> 11:54.210
I'll just rent them
both out after school
to the detention crowd.

11:54.210 --> 11:55.920
Those delinquents always
need a little pick-me-up.

11:57.460 --> 11:58.540
Is Gacket open yet?

11:58.540 --> 11:59.710
We'll be open at 3:00.

11:59.710 --> 12:01.920
Perfect! I have detention!

12:01.920 --> 12:03.040
Yes! (laughs)

12:10.710 --> 12:14.880
No offense, but all that
anti-Mitch-craft stuff
is making you stink.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.120
Yeah, but it's worth it.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.710
I haven't gotten a poke.

12:18.710 --> 12:20.120
Ow!

12:20.120 --> 12:21.620
I just got a poke!

12:21.620 --> 12:23.790
So, you stink for nothing?

12:23.790 --> 12:25.290
Well, it wasn't for nothing!

12:25.290 --> 12:28.080
This stink cost 150 bucks.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.040
And I'm still under a spell.

12:31.290 --> 12:33.040
There's only
one thing left to do.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.120
What do you want?

12:38.290 --> 12:41.880
Listen, Mitch, we made
a bad decision before.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.880
And we want to take you up
on your offer to hang out.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.210
Let me check my...

12:46.210 --> 12:47.750
"shed-you-el."

12:47.750 --> 12:49.040
(door unlocks)

12:49.040 --> 12:50.670
You're lucky.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.460
I just had a last minute
"cancel-ay-shee-on."

12:53.460 --> 12:55.080
Come on in, losers.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.170
Mitch:
Welcome to Mitch-topia!

13:00.170 --> 13:02.040
Ooh!

13:02.040 --> 13:04.170
Ooh!

13:04.170 --> 13:06.120
That's right.
Get 'em outta your system.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.170
"Ooh-sers."

13:07.170 --> 13:08.330
(laughs)

13:08.330 --> 13:10.080
No way!

13:10.080 --> 13:12.790
You've got the awesome
Zip Zap Zoom game?

13:13.880 --> 13:14.920
Wanna play it?

13:16.170 --> 13:18.290
Do I? Ow!

13:18.290 --> 13:19.210
Why are you poking me?

13:19.210 --> 13:21.330
To remind you
why we're here.

13:21.330 --> 13:23.080
You're right!

13:23.080 --> 13:24.960
Uh, Mitch?

13:24.960 --> 13:26.830
I really shouldn't play
on an empty stomach.

13:26.830 --> 13:29.500
He gets a little hangry.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.330
You won't like him
when he's hangry.

13:31.330 --> 13:33.750
I don't really like him now.

13:33.750 --> 13:35.250
But okay!

13:38.540 --> 13:40.460
Okay, you take that side.

13:40.460 --> 13:42.120
I'll take this side.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.960
Now...

13:43.960 --> 13:46.210
where would Mitch
hide mini-Booker?

13:46.210 --> 13:47.290
Ow!

13:47.290 --> 13:48.710
I just got poked!

13:48.710 --> 13:51.830
That just means
there's a mini-Levi too!

13:51.830 --> 13:53.500
This is getting worse!

13:53.500 --> 13:55.250
He's coming for both of us!

13:56.500 --> 13:58.960
Oh, the awesome
two-sided game table!

14:00.960 --> 14:02.040
(whirring)

14:02.040 --> 14:03.330
Whoa!

14:03.330 --> 14:04.580
No!

14:05.710 --> 14:06.920
Who wants smoothies?

14:06.920 --> 14:08.830
-(both scream)
-Get away from us!

14:08.830 --> 14:10.380
We know what
you've been doing!

14:10.380 --> 14:15.210
What?
I-- I've just been
playing Ice Zombies.

14:15.210 --> 14:18.380
It looked like you were
sewing dolls of us,

14:18.380 --> 14:19.790
you Mitch-doctor!

14:19.790 --> 14:22.330
That wasn't a doll of you!

14:22.330 --> 14:25.750
Ow! Then why do I
keep getting poked
in my neck?

14:25.750 --> 14:27.330
Ow! Me too!

14:27.330 --> 14:28.920
Maybe the name tags
your mommies sew

14:28.920 --> 14:31.210
in your hoodies
are poking you.

14:31.210 --> 14:34.830
Our mommies don't sew
our names in our hoodies.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.250
They write them!

14:38.380 --> 14:40.250
What the heck is this?

14:40.250 --> 14:43.120
It looks like one of
your mom's cactus thorns.

14:44.330 --> 14:45.500
(grunts)

14:45.500 --> 14:47.540
Looks like she
got one in mine, too.

14:49.830 --> 14:52.420
Guess that explains
all the poking.

14:52.420 --> 14:55.210
But that doesn't explain...

14:55.210 --> 14:56.080
(table whirs)

14:57.380 --> 14:59.920
all of this weird
sewing stuff!

14:59.920 --> 15:01.920
Okay, fine!

15:01.920 --> 15:04.580
So, I sew. So-- so what?

15:05.580 --> 15:08.670
I find it quite relaxing.

15:13.420 --> 15:15.080
(whispers)
That was my vision.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.080
You know what else
relaxes me?

15:18.080 --> 15:19.170
You leaving!

15:20.420 --> 15:22.420
One quick game
of Zip Zap Zoom?

15:22.420 --> 15:23.420
Hit the bricks!

15:29.710 --> 15:31.210
Loving this jacket!

15:31.210 --> 15:33.040
I'll take the cape, too.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.170
Oh, the cape
combo platter.

15:35.170 --> 15:36.380
You've got ten minutes.

15:36.380 --> 15:37.670
We got other people waiting.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.080
And go!

15:40.330 --> 15:41.790
This is going great!

15:41.790 --> 15:44.000
I told you.
We have nothing
to worry about.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.880
-I know what the people want.
-(phone dings)

15:47.040 --> 15:48.500
Oh, look.
It's a text from Zeena.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.420
She probably
wants some fashion tips.

15:50.420 --> 15:51.670
No, it says,

15:51.670 --> 15:54.120
"Prepare to go
from a fashionista

15:54.120 --> 15:56.120
to a fashion-leasta."

15:56.120 --> 15:57.210
Zeena:
Excuse me.

15:59.580 --> 16:03.210
According to Lit 'Fit's
Fashion Premium Prime,

16:03.210 --> 16:05.960
black and white is out,
and multi-colored is in.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.920
Which means bye-bye, Gacket.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.460
Premium Prime!

16:21.420 --> 16:23.460
-I'd wear this!
-Five bucks!

16:23.460 --> 16:24.580
What?

16:24.580 --> 16:26.830
It's not even
in style anymore!

16:28.330 --> 16:30.420
If it makes
you feel better,

16:30.420 --> 16:31.960
I spent all my money, too,

16:31.960 --> 16:34.290
on a stupid spell remedy book.

16:34.290 --> 16:36.960
And Mom still thinks
we're putting money
in the bank on Monday.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.380
-(door unlocking)
-(gasps) Mom's home!

16:38.380 --> 16:39.920
Help hide the jacket
and the cape!

16:42.210 --> 16:43.790
Hi, kids! Whatcha doing?

16:45.040 --> 16:46.120
Digging.

16:47.330 --> 16:50.040
For loose change to put
into our savings accounts.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.960
Aw, I am so proud of you

16:52.960 --> 16:56.460
taking this money saving
thing seriously.

16:56.460 --> 16:58.040
But I wouldn't bother
with the cushions though,

16:58.040 --> 16:59.460
I went through
those this morning.

16:59.460 --> 17:03.170
That's how I got me
$1.37 worth of tacos.

17:05.620 --> 17:07.620
What are you guys
gonna do now?

17:09.120 --> 17:11.710
Well, if I need $150,

17:11.710 --> 17:14.120
and you need $150,

17:14.120 --> 17:15.420
and black and white is out,

17:15.420 --> 17:17.750
but multi-colored is in,

17:17.750 --> 17:20.000
there can only
be one answer.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.290
Eleven!

17:23.380 --> 17:25.920
What?! It sounded
like a math problem!

17:29.460 --> 17:32.250
Why didn't you just say
we were gonna paint the jacket?

17:34.710 --> 17:36.000
What do you think?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.420
I think you
made this jacket

17:37.420 --> 17:39.120
-look as good as Zeena's.
-Thank you.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.620
But isn't your mom
gonna notice

17:40.620 --> 17:41.920
you used her paints?

17:41.920 --> 17:43.920
Not if I refill them
with water.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.040
Besides, her cat painting's
almost done.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.460
(phone dings)

17:49.380 --> 17:50.460
Oh, no!

17:50.460 --> 17:51.540
A text from Zeena!

17:51.540 --> 17:53.040
All jackets
and capes are out!

17:53.040 --> 17:54.710
Even multi-colored ones?

17:54.710 --> 17:55.880
(phone dings)

17:55.880 --> 17:58.040
Even multi-colored ones!

17:58.040 --> 18:00.000
So, what is in?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.460
(phone dings)

18:01.460 --> 18:03.120
Cell phone pouches?

18:04.460 --> 18:06.290
What are we gonna do now?

18:07.540 --> 18:08.880
Doesn't say!

18:10.330 --> 18:11.420
Okay, fine!

18:11.420 --> 18:12.880
What's the one thing
we can do?

18:12.880 --> 18:15.210
Can you please just tell us?

18:16.420 --> 18:18.620
We'll just cut these up
and sew them into capes.

18:18.620 --> 18:20.460
We're back in business!

18:20.460 --> 18:23.500
But the only person
we know who sews
is your mom,

18:23.500 --> 18:25.620
and I don't think
she's gonna hop on board.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.330
Actually...

18:27.330 --> 18:30.210
Booker, who's the one person
we know who can help us?

18:30.210 --> 18:33.210
Why is everyone
speaking in riddles?

18:37.620 --> 18:39.380
I feel so alive!

18:40.620 --> 18:42.080
-Sew faster!
-Sew faster!

18:42.080 --> 18:44.420
We need 50 pouches
by morning!

18:44.420 --> 18:45.620
Don't rush me.

18:45.620 --> 18:46.790
I'm a craftsman.

18:46.790 --> 18:48.380
Okay, sorry.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.580
But sew faster!

18:56.290 --> 18:58.580
This is great!
We made all
of the money back!

18:58.580 --> 19:01.380
I've gotta say,
for a while there,

19:01.380 --> 19:03.540
I was very concerned,
but soon,

19:03.540 --> 19:06.540
we'll be able to look
back on this and laugh.

19:08.210 --> 19:09.920
-(fabric rips)
-(Booker yelps)

19:09.920 --> 19:11.420
-(Nia gasps)
-(Tess moans)

19:11.420 --> 19:12.880
Or cry!

19:12.880 --> 19:16.120
Maybe there was
just something wrong with ours?

19:16.120 --> 19:17.960
(fabric ripping)

19:19.500 --> 19:20.540
Nope!

19:23.960 --> 19:25.710
We want our money back!

19:25.710 --> 19:27.120
Got a receipt?

19:29.380 --> 19:30.420
That'll work.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.250
(purring)

19:37.250 --> 19:39.460
They say the eyes
are the window to the soul.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.880
Carmichael got a little
booger in his soul.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.540
Okay.
(clears throat)

19:49.670 --> 19:50.790
Oh! Oh!

19:52.540 --> 19:54.290
What happened to my paints?

19:54.290 --> 19:56.750
-Something wrong?
-Huh? No, nothing
to water about--

19:56.750 --> 19:58.790
I mean, worry. (clears throat)
Worry-- worry about.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.170
Oh, hey, Mom!

20:01.170 --> 20:02.790
-Hey.
-Look at you!

20:02.790 --> 20:05.580
Painting.
She's painting.

20:05.580 --> 20:06.620
(whispers)
I can see that!

20:06.620 --> 20:08.170
Wow, Mom!

20:08.170 --> 20:11.170
I haven't seen you
painting in a long time!

20:11.170 --> 20:12.960
-Carry on!
-I don't wanna
stop your flow.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.620
Stop!

20:14.620 --> 20:16.710
Y'all know anything
about my paints?

20:16.710 --> 20:18.500
Together:
No.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.540
-Mm-mm.
-Let me see them souls!

20:23.460 --> 20:25.460
Mm-mm, I don't like it.
Get in the kitchen.

20:25.460 --> 20:27.000
-Get in the kitchen.
-(Booker mumbling)

20:27.000 --> 20:28.540
You, too. You, too.
Get in the kitchen.

20:28.540 --> 20:30.670
Sorry.
We'll be right back.

20:30.670 --> 20:31.710
Okay.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.380
Can someone explain to me

20:34.380 --> 20:36.670
why Carmichael's face
is leaking?

20:36.670 --> 20:37.960
Are-- are you asking,

20:37.960 --> 20:39.750
or do you already
know the answer,

20:39.750 --> 20:42.460
because there's been a lot
of that going on lately.

20:42.460 --> 20:45.880
Somebody watered down
my paints!

20:45.880 --> 20:48.170
Who was it and why?

20:48.170 --> 20:50.170
Let's eliminate
one of the options.

20:50.170 --> 20:51.540
Wasn't me. Good night.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.120
Okay.

20:55.580 --> 20:57.580
I bought that jacket
you told me not to,

20:57.580 --> 20:59.170
earned back the money
by renting it out,

20:59.170 --> 21:01.170
then got caught up in
the whole fashion thing,

21:01.170 --> 21:03.000
bought a cape, too, and then
black and white was out,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.170
and multi-colored was in--

21:04.170 --> 21:05.830
What she's
trying to say is...

21:06.670 --> 21:08.000
Wasn't me either.
Good night.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.380
Stop!

21:09.380 --> 21:11.880
I cannot believe
you disobeyed me, Nia.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.000
I told you how important
that money was,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.620
and you went and just spent it
on some jacket and cape?

21:17.620 --> 21:18.580
Who even wears capes?

21:18.580 --> 21:21.080
Well, I'm off
to the "super" market

21:21.080 --> 21:22.750
in my new cape!
(laughs)

21:22.750 --> 21:25.750
I'll be back in
a single bound!

21:25.750 --> 21:27.500
Oh, and Rae, I took
a $20 off the dresser.

21:31.960 --> 21:33.830
I apologize, Mom.

21:33.830 --> 21:36.380
I just got so caught up in
wanting to be a trendsetter.

21:36.380 --> 21:37.790
I should have
listened to you.

21:37.790 --> 21:39.000
Do you see now
what I meant

21:39.000 --> 21:41.380
about being responsible
with your money?

21:41.380 --> 21:43.210
We can't always spend it
on the things we want,

21:43.210 --> 21:45.790
so we can have it
for the things we need.

21:45.790 --> 21:46.880
Well...

21:46.880 --> 21:48.580
I hope you learned
your lesson, Nia.

21:48.580 --> 21:50.920
Yes, that's right!
At least Booker knows

21:50.920 --> 21:53.170
not to go and blow his money
on meaningless things.

21:53.170 --> 21:56.750
Would you consider a $130
spell remedy book meaningless?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.170
Now, that depends.

21:58.170 --> 21:59.210
Did it work?

22:00.540 --> 22:01.620
No.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.330
Then, yes!

22:05.460 --> 22:08.620
You both blew your money
for the DC trip?

22:08.620 --> 22:10.460
I-- I'm sorry, Mom.

22:10.460 --> 22:11.920
I hope you are,
because I don't know how

22:11.920 --> 22:13.710
you're gonna go
on that DC trip now.

22:13.710 --> 22:15.040
Gloria:
What's going on in there?

22:15.040 --> 22:17.620
And because of you two,
I might lose money!

22:17.620 --> 22:20.460
Carmichael wants to know
if there's a problem
with his portrait.

22:20.460 --> 22:23.170
Listen, Gloria, this may not
be what you had in mind--

22:23.170 --> 22:24.750
(gasps)
You're right!

22:26.460 --> 22:27.790
It's better!

22:27.790 --> 22:29.670
-It is?
-Yes!

22:29.670 --> 22:33.210
Carmichael always cries
whenever I leave the house.

22:33.210 --> 22:35.170
You captured his expression

22:35.170 --> 22:36.790
"purr-fectly."

22:36.790 --> 22:39.500
(chuckles)
Well, you know how I do.

22:39.500 --> 22:43.620
I can't believe I'm getting
this painting for only $500!

22:43.620 --> 22:44.750
Ooh, tell your friends!

22:44.750 --> 22:46.210
-I will!
-Okay.

22:46.210 --> 22:47.580
Thank you, Gloria.

22:47.580 --> 22:49.000
-Bye.
-I'll cash this tomorrow.

22:50.580 --> 22:51.620
Well...

22:52.750 --> 22:54.080
today's my lucky day.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.380
How can we make it
our lucky day, Mom?

22:56.380 --> 22:57.830
What can we do
to earn back the money

22:57.830 --> 22:59.380
so we can go
on that DC trip?

22:59.380 --> 23:00.880
And pay for my paints!

23:00.880 --> 23:02.620
And pay for your paints.

23:02.620 --> 23:05.580
Well, besides the chores
you already do,

23:05.580 --> 23:07.000
you can, uh,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.290
wash my Scut car
after every shift.

23:09.290 --> 23:10.670
Done!

23:10.670 --> 23:12.790
Vacuum my Scut car.

23:12.790 --> 23:14.380
-Definitely.
-And...

23:14.380 --> 23:15.580
Drive my Scut car.

23:15.580 --> 23:17.750
We're not even
old enough to drive.

23:17.750 --> 23:19.420
You will be by the time
you pay off this trip.

23:19.420 --> 23:20.460
Let's go.

23:20.460 --> 23:22.710
Get to it, scoot to it!

23:27.580 --> 23:28.670
Ha!

23:28.670 --> 23:29.880
Joke's on Mom!

23:29.880 --> 23:31.580
I just found a quarter.

23:31.580 --> 23:33.710
Ooh! Taco money!

23:33.710 --> 23:34.620
(cackles)
