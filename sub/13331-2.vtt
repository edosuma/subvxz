WEBVTT

00:07.574 --> 00:09.342
Geordie Shore is back.

00:09.409 --> 00:11.644
What the hell
is gonna happen this time?

00:12.212 --> 00:13.947
Geordie Tours.
Where?

00:14.013 --> 00:16.015
Across Europe.
(all cheer)

00:16.082 --> 00:18.017
She's sending us to Europe.

00:18.084 --> 00:21.121
(girls)
What happens on tour stays on tour!

00:21.187 --> 00:23.189
Bring on the fucking carnage!

00:23.256 --> 00:25.692
Hardcore double sex.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.527
Dust this, buck that.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.763
Sex machine!
Fucking thing'll blow up.

00:29.829 --> 00:32.966
Everybody's noticing an atmosphere
between me and James.

00:33.032 --> 00:35.735
James is being a massive dickhead.

00:35.802 --> 00:38.037
Let's get fucking smashed!

00:38.838 --> 00:41.241
Don't be a fool, wrap your tool.

00:41.307 --> 00:43.877
Gary's turned up,
and I don't give a shit.

00:45.478 --> 00:47.347
He's all over her like a fanny rash.

00:47.414 --> 00:50.016
What the fuck
has happened to Charlotte?

00:50.083 --> 00:53.486
I am in control, and then all
of a sudden, I wanna shag him.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.188
(moans)

00:55.255 --> 00:58.758
Charlottes bouncing on top of us,
screaming in Holly's ear.

00:58.825 --> 01:02.796
Why the fuck are they having sex
right next to me in the bed?

01:05.331 --> 01:07.534
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.702
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.771
Look up pulling,
my name's next to it.

01:11.838 --> 01:14.207
I wouldn't kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:14.274 --> 01:16.042
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.178
I could talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.246
Got the looks, the charm. Just works.

01:20.313 --> 01:22.615
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.584
The hardest graft I do is me hair.

01:24.651 --> 01:27.120
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:36.596 --> 01:39.666
Fuck me!
I'm in bed with the parsnip.

01:43.336 --> 01:45.305
I've gotta get out of here now.

01:45.371 --> 01:47.540
Where the fuck
did he sleep last night,

01:47.607 --> 01:49.242
the sneaky little twat?

01:56.316 --> 01:58.351
(laughs) What the fuck?

02:05.625 --> 02:09.162
Get over it, Holly.
I've had to listen to you buck loads.

02:16.436 --> 02:19.706
Them two have opened up
a big can of worms.

02:26.679 --> 02:30.183
We've been in Amsterdam looking
after stag and hen dos for Anna,

02:30.250 --> 02:33.453
but it's our final morning,
and we can't wait to get back.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.989
I'm in.
Can I leave him behind?

02:39.726 --> 02:41.060
I had sex with Gary.

02:41.127 --> 02:43.429
Shock.
Who thought that would happen?

02:43.496 --> 02:46.766
(Ricci) Make my bacon sandwich, man!

02:49.002 --> 02:51.638
What is that noise?
That's my future husband.

02:58.678 --> 03:02.181
Goodbye, houseboat.
Goodbye, sex with Gary.

03:02.248 --> 03:05.718
Newcastle, we're coming home.
Woop! Woop!

03:09.188 --> 03:11.624
(blows raspberry) Bye, you tossers.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.805
I'm so glad to be home!

03:25.872 --> 03:27.840
Oh, my God! Home, sweet home.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.376
Scramble and Egg are still alive!

03:30.443 --> 03:32.912
Oh, the water stinks.

03:49.128 --> 03:51.898
What happened in Amsterdam
stays in Amsterdam.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.701
I'm back in Newcastle,
I'm part of the Buck Squad,

03:54.767 --> 03:58.638
I'm gonna go fucking nuts. I just
hope she doesn't go fucking nuts.

03:59.472 --> 04:03.743
(Sophie) I've missed me boyfriend
Joel so much while I've been away.

04:03.810 --> 04:06.946
I hope he's missed me
as much as I've missed him.

04:11.150 --> 04:12.285
What the fuck?

04:23.663 --> 04:27.734
What it sounds like to me, is that
he's trying to break up with us.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.769
I need to see Joel tonight.

04:31.771 --> 04:36.009
I'm scared that when I see him,
it's gonna be like, "Oh, my God."

04:37.010 --> 04:39.646
I don't know what's gonna happen.

04:39.712 --> 04:41.147
I'm shitting me self.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.816
I think once you see him,
it'll be fine, like.

04:43.883 --> 04:47.053
Obviously, he's gonna miss you,
you're missing him.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.456
So, I'm telling Sophie that
everything's gonna be all right,

04:50.523 --> 04:52.659
but we all know that
Joel's been a dick,

04:52.725 --> 04:54.227
who knows what he's gonna do?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.636
Me and Sophie are the only
people left in the house

05:03.703 --> 05:06.172
with relationships going on
outside of it.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.808
I'm the only person who understands.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.309
Hope she's all right.

05:13.012 --> 05:15.948
(phone rings)
The phone rings, and it's Anna.

05:16.749 --> 05:18.484
OK. Who's at work?

05:28.094 --> 05:30.797
No problem. I'll let them know.
Thank you. Bye.

05:30.863 --> 05:34.200
She's thinking, "Who can I pick
who won't flirt with girls

05:34.267 --> 05:36.936
and will sit in the corner
and repulse everyone?"

05:37.003 --> 05:38.604
"James and Dan."

05:42.775 --> 05:45.611
On what?
On the limo bus.

05:45.678 --> 05:50.316
So, Anna wants me and James to serve
drinks to a hen party on a limo bus.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.518
Fucking, we can nail that.

05:52.585 --> 05:55.588
Please can she remind you
to not buck them on the bus.

05:58.157 --> 06:00.760
I'm gonna be the boss,
seeing as I've got a bird.

06:00.827 --> 06:03.362
I'm gonna kick back,
let him do all the graft.

06:03.429 --> 06:04.430
He might pull.

06:10.703 --> 06:14.741
So, I go to the restaurant,
and shock, Joel is late.

06:14.807 --> 06:16.442
Where the bloody hell are you?

06:16.509 --> 06:19.779
I feel nervous,
I'm sweating like a fat lass,

06:19.846 --> 06:23.282
I don't know what to do
and I'm starting to get the shakes.

06:23.349 --> 06:28.287
And then he comes...
in a fucking onesie.

06:28.354 --> 06:30.423
Even though he's
dressed like a twat,

06:30.490 --> 06:32.158
he's got us a bunch of flowers.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.994
A bunch of flowers, to a girl,
changes everything

06:39.932 --> 06:42.535
What was all that fuss about?
Joel seems fine.

06:42.602 --> 06:45.004
All that worrying
for absolutely nothing.

06:49.909 --> 06:53.446
Fucking starter? Now I know
everything's definitely all right.

06:53.513 --> 06:54.947
I can fix this with a kiss.

06:57.283 --> 07:01.487
Relationship sorted,
but what the fuck does he look like?

07:18.671 --> 07:22.408
Anna's got us working on a limo bus
for a hen party. Wicked.

07:30.149 --> 07:32.084
Even Gaz and Scott are happy for us.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.687
They're encouraging us
to bring girls back.

07:34.754 --> 07:37.290
See you later.
Have fun.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.097
I'm imagining seven butch women

07:45.164 --> 07:49.268
with pink cowboy hats
and whistles, ready for you.

07:49.335 --> 07:52.171
All of them are just
gonna be waiting for you.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.973
Oh, my God, man, don't say that.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.909
James has got a girlfriend,
so the pressure's on me.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.413
If these girls are dry,
it's my job to get them wet.

08:00.479 --> 08:03.883
All right, how you doing?
You're all lively.

08:05.651 --> 08:06.919
Fuck, who died?

08:06.986 --> 08:10.423
There's no atmosphere, no music,
the drinks aren't flowing.

08:10.489 --> 08:14.493
Me and James need to get
this party started.

08:17.129 --> 08:18.831
Dan is looking for a girl.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.338
I'm giving them what they want.

08:25.404 --> 08:28.808
The drinks are flowing,
people are dancing,

08:28.875 --> 08:32.178
I've got a bird doing the splits.
We should do this full time.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.746
Off! Off! Off!

08:33.813 --> 08:35.214
(cheering)

08:36.616 --> 08:39.385
One girl comes across
and pounces on us.

08:39.452 --> 08:42.288
Fuck it, I'm a dedicated
employee of Geordie Tours.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.859
I'm not sure how Anna will react.

08:46.926 --> 08:49.762
Whether she'll tan me arse,
or give us a high five.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.764
Either way, hash tag bothered.

08:51.831 --> 08:55.134
Dan... where ya going?

08:55.201 --> 08:57.136
Looks like I've bagged a worldie.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.284
Wait until the Buck Squad
see this one.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.853
Four way kiss, standard procedure.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.455
Looks like I'm getting
some action tonight.

09:16.522 --> 09:19.859
I neck on the first person I see.
Tash on to the next levels.

09:19.926 --> 09:23.262
Go on, fanny!
He's a cunt with a quiff.

09:23.329 --> 09:26.565
The tornado's gone right up me
arsehole. Fucking bring it on.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.834
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

09:48.554 --> 09:49.689
Hi.

09:49.755 --> 09:54.827
What the fuck? Sophie's just arrived
with a giant walking American flag.

09:54.894 --> 09:59.432
Oh, no, wait, it's just
Joel in a onesie. Twat.

10:05.972 --> 10:10.443
Bell end, bell end, bell end!
Who the fuck does that?!

10:16.949 --> 10:19.418
Charlotte and Holly
are the Cock Capturers.

10:19.485 --> 10:24.223
It's their cute little alliteration
and excuse to be massive slags.

10:27.994 --> 10:31.130
OK, so we haven't
captured any cocks yet,

10:31.197 --> 10:33.666
but when the competition
kicks off tonight,

10:33.733 --> 10:36.635
I know we're gonna kick
the Buck Squad's arse.

10:39.572 --> 10:43.509
They haven't even got a handshake.
Amateurs.

10:44.844 --> 10:48.147
End of the day, if the
Cock Capturers want a little battle,

10:48.214 --> 10:50.816
they're going up against
me and fucking Scott.

10:50.883 --> 10:54.453
They cant handle their drink.
There's only gonna be one winner.

10:54.520 --> 10:58.290
Does what happened in Amsterdam
really stay in Amsterdam? Yep.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.359
The funny thing
about Charlotte is,

11:00.426 --> 11:02.928
she's gonna try and keep up
this act that,

11:02.995 --> 11:06.599
"I've just fucked Gary. Nailed and
bailed, smashed and nashed,"

11:06.665 --> 11:09.368
like she's not bothered.
We know that's not true.

11:14.707 --> 11:18.544
I am genuinely feeling
really strong this time.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.513
I'm not going back to the parsnip.

11:27.119 --> 11:30.589
It's our first night back in
Newcastle. Amsterdam's been done,

11:30.656 --> 11:33.692
it's time to hit Bijoux
and get stuck into them students.

11:33.759 --> 11:36.996
(all cheer)

11:41.967 --> 11:45.571
Tonight is all about the
Cock Capturers vs the Bucking Squad.

11:45.638 --> 11:46.772
Fucking bring it on.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.975
We get to Bijoux
and it's fucking rammed.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.745
All I can see is birds everywhere.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.713
It is so good to be home.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.851
Usually, me and Charlotte
are shit at pulling,

11:58.918 --> 12:01.053
but now we're rivalling
the Buck Squad,

12:01.120 --> 12:03.923
we've got to beat them.
I will not lose at this game.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.800
Scotty fucking T
drags two wicked birds in.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.469
One for me, one for Gaz.

12:16.535 --> 12:19.371
The Buck Squad is definitely
back in action.

12:20.372 --> 12:23.375
I'm watching Gary kissing,
and I don't feel anything.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.044
I'm empty. Nothing.

12:25.111 --> 12:27.079
It was just going perfectly.

12:27.146 --> 12:30.149
So, the Buck Squad have pulled,
and we're thinking,

12:30.216 --> 12:33.586
"There's a lot of good looking boys,
we just need to pull one."

12:38.324 --> 12:39.492
It can't be that hard.

12:44.463 --> 12:45.965
Fuck me, I'm a cock,

12:46.031 --> 12:50.569
and I definitely wouldn't
wanna be captured by one of them.

12:50.636 --> 12:55.374
All of a sudden, Dan's bird, who he
necked on with on the bus, comes in.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.744
This is too easy. Looks like
I'm getting some action tonight.

12:58.811 --> 13:02.948
Me and Scott were saying, "Dan, you
cannot fail to pull on a hen do."

13:03.015 --> 13:04.550
I'd have rather failed.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.419
(laughs)

13:07.486 --> 13:09.321
They told us to pull, I've pulled.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.924
There's no pleasing those two.
What the fuck?

13:15.728 --> 13:17.463
There's nothing wrong with her,

13:17.530 --> 13:19.732
but it's not worth
the grief I'm getting.

13:19.798 --> 13:22.535
I'm gonna run away and hide
at the back of the club.

13:32.845 --> 13:36.182
So, this wicked brunette,
who I'm with, has got a mate,

13:36.248 --> 13:39.485
and it's her birthday.
Standard procedure, four-way kiss.

13:40.586 --> 13:42.488
His tongue touches mine.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.323
He's got with all of Newcastle,

13:44.390 --> 13:47.226
it was a matter of time
before he tried it on with me.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.461
(laughter)

13:49.528 --> 13:51.997
I'm gonna show every boy in this club

13:52.064 --> 13:55.801
that I am free, single
and ready for me fanny to mingle.

13:55.868 --> 13:57.670
Go on, fanny!

14:03.442 --> 14:06.478
Now, the first boy we meet
has got a girlfriend.

14:06.545 --> 14:07.947
The second boy we meet...

14:10.049 --> 14:11.717
...has also got a girlfriend.

14:14.386 --> 14:15.721
The third boy we meet...

14:18.157 --> 14:21.760
...gives us a drink and we're
thinking we're on to a winner.

14:21.827 --> 14:24.330
He's got a fucking girlfriend again.

14:24.396 --> 14:28.767
We get pied three times. Three.
Are you for fucking real?

14:38.110 --> 14:42.081
Shock, Joel is completely mortal.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.893
He better be all right
cos now that we've made up,

14:54.960 --> 14:57.363
I want him to shag us senseless.

14:58.597 --> 15:02.067
It's our first night back
in Newcastle, and it's fucking shit.

15:02.134 --> 15:05.838
All the singles are on the pull,
all the couples are necking on.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.439
I'm left by me self.

15:07.506 --> 15:11.310
I don't know how much longer
I can cope with without seeing Kate.

15:12.811 --> 15:15.547
Me and Charlotte are panicking.

15:25.624 --> 15:28.327
I'm running out of options here
and I need to pull,

15:28.394 --> 15:31.697
so I grab the nearest boy to us,
and he's got a massive tash.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.166
I'm taking tash on
to the next levels.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.974
Charlotte's necking on,
so I turn round and I neck on

15:42.041 --> 15:44.410
with the first person I see.
Buzzing.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.815
Charlotte is on fire.
She's doing brilliantly.

15:50.983 --> 15:54.586
And then she goes and pulls a
Charlotte and gets fucking mortal.

15:54.653 --> 15:57.122
Someone take us home, please.

15:57.189 --> 15:59.725
Sorry, single cocks.
Better luck next time.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.537
The thing that
pisses me off about Gary

16:11.603 --> 16:15.007
is that he ignores Charlotte
for the majority of a night.

16:15.074 --> 16:18.744
Then, when she's drunk and me and
Ricci have got her in the house,

16:18.811 --> 16:21.246
he swoops in like a knight
in shining armour,

16:21.313 --> 16:23.282
acting like he fucking cares.

16:23.349 --> 16:26.518
I do care about her.
I know her better than anyone.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.854
I can't just have her
pass out on the sofa.

16:28.921 --> 16:31.290
I pick her up and put her to bed.

16:31.357 --> 16:35.661
He is not a knight in shinning
armour. He's a cunt with a quiff.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.564
The others can deal with
drunk Charlotte this time.

16:38.630 --> 16:39.665
My lad's here,

16:39.732 --> 16:43.802
and I wanna go to the shag pad
and bounce on his big, fat cock.

16:45.437 --> 16:46.638
He can't even get up.

16:46.705 --> 16:50.309
How the fuck am I supposed to have
sex with someone who is so drunk?

16:53.112 --> 16:56.782
So, then we're in bed together,
and I'm starting to get a bit horny,

16:56.849 --> 16:59.485
and I'm starting to
forget about how drunk he is.

16:59.551 --> 17:02.588
Maybe him being drunk,
we can experiment more things.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.990
Everyone knows drunken sex
is the best sex.

17:12.731 --> 17:15.666
Then, all of a sudden,
it turns into really weird sex.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.903
Sex I've never experienced
with Joel.

17:26.044 --> 17:28.414
You fucker.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.453
It's like a tornado's
gone right up me arsehole.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.962
It's been a fab night.

17:44.029 --> 17:47.065
I haven't ended it with me
boyfriend. We're together.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.168
We've just had the best sex ever.

18:03.015 --> 18:05.818
I'm like Super fucking Mario,
but with a huge bulge.

18:05.884 --> 18:07.486
I'll help you pull.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.087
(squeals)

18:09.154 --> 18:11.824
My fanny didn't even flinch!

18:11.890 --> 18:13.892
(all cheer)

18:13.959 --> 18:16.562
It's Geordie Shore,
not Geordie bore.

18:16.628 --> 18:19.398
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

18:37.516 --> 18:40.919
Feels amazing to wake up in this
house with me boyfriend here.

18:40.986 --> 18:44.256
And I know that our relationship
is just now content.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.125
It'll be hard to say "bye" again.

18:50.162 --> 18:52.498
It's mine and Vicky's
anniversary today,

18:52.564 --> 18:55.968
and the one thing I know she loves
is breakfast in bed.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.237
Joel and Sophie
have stole the shag pad,

18:58.303 --> 19:01.573
but me and Vicky are gonna
be having breakfast alfresco.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.176
I wake up and Ricci's
made me breakfast in bed.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.245
Only, I'm on a fucking balcony.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.013
A bit like Romeo and Juliet.

19:11.049 --> 19:13.986
But I stink of Jagerbombs
and the eggs are fucking shit.

19:26.231 --> 19:29.568
I haven't spoken to Kate
since getting back from Amsterdam.

19:29.635 --> 19:32.404
I'm gonna give her a call,
see if she's missed us.

19:32.471 --> 19:34.039
(phone rings)

19:38.810 --> 19:42.147
Having a girlfriend whilst being
in the Geordie Shore house

19:42.214 --> 19:44.249
is harder than I would have imagined.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.595
Kate's stressing about us
being in here with Holly.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.836
This phone call
just proves I'm right.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.372
I need to keep my distance
from Holly.

20:15.914 --> 20:18.650
I went through a stage
of being upset about James,

20:18.717 --> 20:21.687
being angry.
And now I just couldn't give a fuck.

20:21.753 --> 20:24.323
I'm just over it now.
Nothing's gonna change.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.857
And yeah, I miss me friend,

20:25.924 --> 20:29.895
but I'm not gonna let him know that.
I'm just gonna do my own thing.

20:32.331 --> 20:35.400
I loved last night, me.
I fucking loved it.

20:35.467 --> 20:40.005
I was necking on,
three-way necking on, everything.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.106
It was mint.

20:41.173 --> 20:45.143
I was panicking.
I think Charlotte was panicking.

20:45.210 --> 20:49.047
But what happened in Amsterdam
actually stayed in Amsterdam.

20:49.114 --> 20:51.984
We both had a good night.
It's been perfect.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.118
Who's proud?

20:53.185 --> 20:56.121
I'm proud of both of you
cos you both kissed someone new.

20:56.188 --> 20:59.925
Me and Holly, we did so well.
We tashed on with two lads.

21:09.868 --> 21:11.403
Well done, mate.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.906
I don't know whether she's
saying this to try and convince us,

21:14.973 --> 21:16.441
or convince herself.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.486
It's all tied between the Buck Squad
and the Cock Capturers,

21:27.552 --> 21:29.488
but the competition's just begun.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.497
I've decided to take
the competition up a notch.

21:38.563 --> 21:40.766
We're going go karting.

21:40.832 --> 21:43.101
Who's coming go karting?
Scott, Dan?

21:43.168 --> 21:48.173
Go karting? Why the fuck does Gary
always come up with shit ideas?

21:48.240 --> 21:50.909
Can you get done for
drink driving in a go kart?

21:50.976 --> 21:53.178
I'm buzzing. I love karting.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.013
(phone rings)

21:55.080 --> 21:56.148
(screams)

21:56.214 --> 21:57.449
What the hell?!

21:58.750 --> 21:59.785
Hello.

21:59.851 --> 22:02.054
"Hi. Can I speak to Dan?
It's Anna."

22:02.120 --> 22:05.691
Oh, fuck.
I bet I know what she wants.

22:05.757 --> 22:06.758
Hi, Anna.

22:13.565 --> 22:15.067
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

22:17.202 --> 22:18.203
Right.

22:21.306 --> 22:23.909
I can't believe I'm being punished.

22:23.975 --> 22:27.646
I made that girl's night.
I should be employee of the month.

22:27.713 --> 22:28.714
Bye.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.452
I've gotta go clean that
fucking dirty limo bus

22:33.518 --> 22:35.153
while you go off go karting.

22:35.787 --> 22:37.122
What have you gotta do?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.157
Gotta go clean that scruffy bus.

22:39.224 --> 22:40.992
I'm sure it was worth it, Dan.

22:44.162 --> 22:45.497
Time to bounce.

22:45.564 --> 22:49.568
Dan, fucking enjoy cleaning
that fucking bus, kid. (laughs)

22:58.744 --> 23:00.445
I absolutely love go karting.

23:00.512 --> 23:03.715
I'm like Super fucking Mario,
but with a huge bulge.

23:08.186 --> 23:10.722
You here to clean the bus?
It's me punishment.

23:10.789 --> 23:13.258
There's your wash brush,
there's your hose.

23:13.325 --> 23:15.627
Just start at the top,
work your way down.

23:15.694 --> 23:18.163
Do a good job.
Why-aye, mate. I'll crack on.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.399
Really?

23:27.105 --> 23:29.174
My God, man, why?

23:30.976 --> 23:33.678
I'll help you pull.
I'm really good at that lately.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.614
Charlotte is bugging us.

23:41.386 --> 23:43.822
The girls are running
before they can walk.

23:43.889 --> 23:45.924
They think they're gonna win this.

23:45.991 --> 23:47.425
Fucking behave.

23:47.492 --> 23:50.428
Watch us win. Bye, babe.

23:50.495 --> 23:53.598
Babe?! I'm not your babe,
you cheeky little fucker.

23:53.665 --> 23:55.333
I know for a fact I'm gonna win.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.969
It's not even gonna be
a competition.

23:58.036 --> 24:01.273
Anything the buck squad can do,
I can do better.

24:12.551 --> 24:14.419
(screams)

24:14.486 --> 24:16.655
Charlotte drives
as well as she pulls.

24:16.721 --> 24:20.692
Someone get her some L plates
and stick them straight on her head.

24:28.166 --> 24:32.771
The Cock Capturers vs the Buck Squad.
When is this shit gonna end?

24:35.240 --> 24:38.210
Cock Capturers vs Buck Squad
is all well and good,

24:38.276 --> 24:41.813
but I'm starting to worry that
Charlotte's taking it too far.

24:46.852 --> 24:48.286
I was like, "Shit."

24:52.023 --> 24:53.225
Is that what she said?

24:54.125 --> 24:57.162
I'm flying around these karts,
having the best day ever.

24:57.229 --> 25:00.799
Dan's cleaning some limo bus.
Do I feel guilty? No.

25:02.334 --> 25:07.539
Why? I should be karting, tanning
the lads' arses round that track.

25:07.606 --> 25:10.408
Instead, I'm cold,
wet and pissed off.

25:10.475 --> 25:13.411
(groans) Fuck off.

25:18.583 --> 25:22.053
To be fair, there was no doubt.
I was always gonna win.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.824
I nearly had you, Gary.

25:25.891 --> 25:29.427
Gary won. So what?
It's a pulling competition,

25:29.494 --> 25:31.830
not a stupid karting competition.

25:34.165 --> 25:36.501
The buck squad were
victorious again.

25:36.568 --> 25:38.169
It's time for a lap of honour.

25:38.236 --> 25:43.975
You were with a girl last night,
and my fanny didn't even flinch!

25:44.042 --> 25:46.578
The final stage
to getting over someone

25:46.645 --> 25:49.514
is hurling abuse at them,
and it works.

25:51.549 --> 25:52.884
It really works.

25:52.951 --> 25:54.586
(laughs)

25:54.653 --> 25:57.455
I think Charlotte
is doing a good thing here.

25:57.522 --> 26:01.159
Shouting abuse at the boy you
dislike, but love at the same time.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.295
When he can't hear anything at all.

26:10.201 --> 26:12.237
(sighs)

26:12.304 --> 26:14.639
Necking with that bird
wasn't worth it.

26:14.706 --> 26:18.043
Keep it in your pants, and you'll
not be here cleaning buses.

26:18.109 --> 26:20.445
I know. I'll try, I'll try.

26:36.361 --> 26:37.529
Home, sweet home.

26:43.068 --> 26:45.303
Tonight, everyone's
off to Ricardo's

26:45.370 --> 26:48.273
to celebrate mine and Ricci's
one year anniversary.

26:59.184 --> 27:03.455
Vicky's looking absolutely gorgeous.
All the Geordie Shore family's here.

27:03.521 --> 27:06.091
What better way to celebrate
our anniversary?

27:06.157 --> 27:09.327
I cant believe a couple
has managed to last this long

27:09.394 --> 27:10.862
in this fucking nut house.

27:10.929 --> 27:15.500
I want everyone to say a big way-hey

27:15.567 --> 27:18.803
and a big one year anniversary
to Ricci and Vicky.

27:18.870 --> 27:22.040
(all cheer)

27:22.107 --> 27:25.443
Happy anniversary.
Well done, guys.

27:25.510 --> 27:28.980
So, me and James are sitting
apart from each other at the table.

27:29.047 --> 27:33.018
Why is this continuing?
Why are you being so immature?

27:33.084 --> 27:35.387
I cant be dealing
with any of that shit.

27:35.453 --> 27:36.688
I haven't spoke to her.

27:36.755 --> 27:39.858
Tonight is not the night.
It's all about Vicky and Ricci.

27:39.924 --> 27:42.660
We broke the Geordie Shore
relationship curse.

27:42.727 --> 27:46.131
Mine's going alreet.
Mine's alreet for once, as well.

27:46.197 --> 27:49.267
To your relationship
and James' relationship, as well.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.169
Thank you.
Me and you.

27:53.671 --> 27:58.343
I could cut the tension between
Holly and James with a knife.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.445
I know why he's doing
what he's doing.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.815
He loves Kate, she's upset
at how close you've been.

28:03.882 --> 28:07.919
It's not like I'm gonna jump on your
boyfriend's cock for God's sake.

28:07.986 --> 28:11.322
It bores me now, so feel free
to have my sloppy seconds.

28:11.389 --> 28:14.726
Genuinely, from the bottom of
me heart, right, it's his loss.

28:14.793 --> 28:17.629
Cos you were a great friend to him

28:17.695 --> 28:20.398
I don't know why he doesn't
just interact with her

28:20.465 --> 28:22.367
and let this all blow over.

28:22.434 --> 28:25.970
This is, like, the calm before
the storm cos it is gonna kick off.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.238
I'm waiting for it.

28:27.305 --> 28:28.540
Charlotte!

28:28.606 --> 28:30.542
What about to the single people?

28:30.608 --> 28:34.012
To the singles!
(all cheer)

28:36.714 --> 28:39.417
Tonight's been amazing.
Exactly what I wanted.

28:39.484 --> 28:41.486
A big celebration with our friends.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.288
Now they're off out on the lash,

28:43.354 --> 28:46.624
and me and Ricci can get
some nice time at home on our own.

28:46.691 --> 28:50.562
We've had a lush meal,
now it's off to Legends.

28:50.628 --> 28:51.963
I've never been before,

28:52.030 --> 28:56.334
but Scotty T promises
it's gonna be epic.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.737
Game's still on.
It's mine and Gary's Buck Squad

28:59.804 --> 29:02.640
vs Holly and Charlotte's
Cock Capturers.

29:02.707 --> 29:05.810
Let's see who pulls
the most tonight, girls.

29:06.544 --> 29:08.780
Sick club, loads of wicked birds.

29:08.847 --> 29:12.517
Thanks, Scotty T. It's full of
young girls for you to buck.

29:12.584 --> 29:17.889
But all the boys are student geeks
with curly perms and pale skin.

29:28.266 --> 29:31.336
It's a complicated situation
between James and Holly.

29:31.402 --> 29:34.239
I know James doesn't wanna
piss off his girlfriend,

29:34.305 --> 29:36.441
but he hasn't got to be
a prick to Holly.

29:38.009 --> 29:41.146
Every time somebody does
something funny, silly,

29:41.212 --> 29:42.780
or slightly embarrassing,

29:42.847 --> 29:45.283
you've got James in the corner
with his water,

29:45.350 --> 29:46.985
looking down his nose.

29:47.051 --> 29:49.554
It's Geordie Shore,
not Geordie fucking bore.

29:55.026 --> 29:57.061
After me phone call with Kate today,

29:57.128 --> 30:01.399
the last place I wanna be
is in a nightclub with drunk Holly.

30:01.466 --> 30:04.169
So I'm going home
and Sophie's coming with us.

30:04.235 --> 30:07.972
James has gone home. He's missing
his bird, he doesn't wanna drink.

30:08.039 --> 30:11.109
That's what happens
when you get a girlfriend.

30:11.176 --> 30:13.444
Fuck off home, Granddad.

30:13.511 --> 30:15.547
# PSY: GANGNAM STYLE

30:25.223 --> 30:27.725
We're gonna capture all the cock.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.597
We found a booth.
We're dragging boys in

30:32.664 --> 30:36.801
and asking if they want a kiss.
Most of them are saying "no".

30:36.868 --> 30:39.771
Which I'm quite shocked about,
but we found one boy

30:39.837 --> 30:41.472
who isn't that good looking.

30:48.446 --> 30:49.881
Holly doesn't wanna do it.

30:49.948 --> 30:53.585
And I need to do it. I need to
do it for single Charlotte.

30:53.651 --> 30:54.652
So, I'm doing it.

30:54.719 --> 30:57.222
And he's kissing so fast,
it's like a Hoover.

30:57.288 --> 30:59.557
Hoovering out me saliva.
What the hell?

31:01.793 --> 31:04.362
Fuck me, it's one-nil
to the Cock Capturers.

31:04.429 --> 31:07.732
Time to call Scotty T
to do some damage.

31:11.736 --> 31:15.440
Scotty T has pulled.
The Buck Squad have pulled.

31:15.506 --> 31:20.278
But Gary hasn't. This still means
we're still only neck and neck.

31:27.352 --> 31:30.555
We're back at the house,
and the teams have come together.

31:31.656 --> 31:34.492
And I'm enjoying the fact
that if we haven't pulled,

31:34.559 --> 31:36.361
the teams can still be sociable.

31:36.427 --> 31:39.764
We're having a laugh, eating
fish food, we're in the hot tub,

31:39.831 --> 31:41.566
I'm actually having a good time.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.101
And fair play to the girls,

31:43.167 --> 31:46.170
they've held their own.
They've proved they can pull.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.039
But can they handle their drink?

31:50.675 --> 31:51.876
Enough said.

31:52.910 --> 31:56.080
We're speed dating tonight.
Tell me your life story.

31:56.147 --> 31:58.583
My heart is hidden deep down.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.518
Two minutes is not a long time.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.620
I need to buck now, tonight!

32:02.687 --> 32:04.088
Cock...

32:04.155 --> 32:05.223
...cock...

32:05.290 --> 32:06.658
...cock...

32:06.724 --> 32:08.893
...between my legs,
and I stink of piss.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.729
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

32:27.945 --> 32:31.049
I'm wet and I stink of piss.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.985
I cant believe you've
pissed yourself again, Char.

32:34.052 --> 32:35.820
It came all the way through.

32:35.887 --> 32:41.659
She distributed the largest amount
of piss I have ever seen in me life.

32:41.726 --> 32:43.761
Three quarters of a mattress.

32:43.828 --> 32:47.098
Oh, there's piss down there,
as well. It's soaking.

32:47.165 --> 32:48.966
(screams)

32:49.033 --> 32:50.702
(laughs)

32:50.768 --> 32:52.904
It goes from there to there.

32:52.970 --> 32:54.639
I've ruined my bed again.

32:54.706 --> 32:58.109
She must have a bladder
the size of a small fucking country.

32:59.610 --> 33:03.081
So, last night, it was the
Cock Capturers vs the Buck Squad,

33:03.147 --> 33:04.215
and no-one banged.

33:04.282 --> 33:07.452
So we're gonna go speed dating
with desperate singles,

33:07.518 --> 33:09.454
and we have more chance of pulling.

33:15.693 --> 33:19.897
I've never been speed dating before,
but fuck it, I'll give it a try.

33:19.964 --> 33:23.334
Do you wanna come
speed dating tonight?

33:23.401 --> 33:26.003
We decide to ask
the single boys to come.

33:26.070 --> 33:28.840
Scott, do you wanna
come speed dating?

33:28.906 --> 33:32.610
Fuck it.
If there's fanny there, I'm game.

33:36.647 --> 33:41.285
Lads, do you fancy a pint?
A pint? Are you mad?

33:41.352 --> 33:43.421
What makes you bad,
makes you better.

33:43.488 --> 33:46.157
Me, Ricci and James
are hanging from last night.

33:46.224 --> 33:47.892
There's only one thing to do,

33:47.959 --> 33:50.428
pint, food and sort me self out.

33:53.598 --> 33:56.934
A quiet pint is the perfect time
to talk to James about Holly.

33:57.001 --> 33:59.237
Obviously,
Holly was really upset, mate.

33:59.303 --> 34:02.140
I understand your
point of view, though.

34:02.206 --> 34:05.176
You don't want to
upset your girlfriend.

34:05.243 --> 34:07.879
You value your relationship
a lot more with Kate

34:07.945 --> 34:10.648
than your friendship with Holly.
100,000,000%.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.985
The best thing you can do, though,
is put it on the table,

34:14.051 --> 34:17.855
and be like, that's your feelings,
that's how you feel towards Kate

34:17.922 --> 34:22.260
and that's how you feel about
you and Holly just being friends.

34:22.326 --> 34:27.197
Exactly what you're saying is what
I thought was going on last time.

34:27.264 --> 34:30.935
And then she come out telling us
she was getting feelings for us,

34:31.002 --> 34:32.904
she was crying all the time.

34:32.969 --> 34:36.107
So this time I don't even
wanna let it get to that.

34:36.174 --> 34:40.545
Ricci's right. I do need to speak
to Holly, but it's still too soon.

34:40.610 --> 34:43.214
You're just so sexy, mate.
You're so loveable.

34:43.281 --> 34:44.916
I'm just too good looking.

34:49.120 --> 34:53.157
We need to look our best,
so we're all going to the salon.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.168
So, speed dating tonight.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.904
Let's talk about things
that you might get asked.

35:06.971 --> 35:10.808
Oh, shit, you've gotta talk to them.
Yeah, you cant just suck them off.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.010
I wanna make sure
they do well tonight,

35:13.077 --> 35:14.946
so I'm doing a bit of role playing.

35:15.012 --> 35:16.280
Hi, I'm Michael.
Hi.

35:16.347 --> 35:19.584
Michael?
Fuck me, this is going really well.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.253
Vicky's pretending to be a boy.
Hi, I'm Paul.

35:22.320 --> 35:26.424
When was the last time you had sex?
That's a bit personal, Charlotte.

35:26.491 --> 35:30.328
For God's sake, Charlotte, I didn't
know you were this bad at pulling.

35:30.394 --> 35:33.064
You're meant to be me wingman.
And you're shit.

35:33.130 --> 35:34.899
Would you have sex with me?

35:34.966 --> 35:36.968
Ugh, don't ever
look at him like that.

35:37.034 --> 35:39.437
She does a weird thing
with her eyebrows.

35:39.504 --> 35:42.173
If I was a boy,
I'd run in the opposite direction.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.141
(laughs) You fucking creep.

35:44.208 --> 35:45.643
It's come-to-bed eyes.

35:49.413 --> 35:52.750
Put a bag over me head now.
I'm not Sophie. I'm someone else.

35:56.587 --> 35:58.656
Are we starting?
Aye, I have.

35:58.723 --> 36:00.424
Dan hardly ever pulls,

36:00.491 --> 36:02.827
so I've decided to
give him some good tips

36:02.894 --> 36:05.263
to help him pull
a worldie at speed dating.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.497
Come on.

36:06.564 --> 36:10.101
Hi, I'm Dan.
I'm 20. I'm from Newcastle.

36:10.167 --> 36:12.169
I like going out,
having a good time.

36:12.236 --> 36:13.704
I'm down to Earth.
Dan...

36:13.771 --> 36:17.041
I've never done this before.
You're just rabbling.

36:17.108 --> 36:19.844
It's not working.
He's still thick as fuck.

36:19.911 --> 36:22.813
You need to sound interested.
Right.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.017
Hello, I'm Sophie.
Really?

36:26.083 --> 36:27.418
Yeah.

36:27.485 --> 36:29.020
Hi, I'm Sophie.
Hi, I'm Dan.

36:29.086 --> 36:33.424
After my disaster the other night,
I'm aiming for a better result.

36:33.491 --> 36:38.229
If you see... any vegetables,

36:38.296 --> 36:39.931
will you let us know?

36:42.333 --> 36:43.334
No?

36:43.401 --> 36:46.370
When is anyone gonna see
a vegetable on a speed date?

36:46.437 --> 36:48.739
He's starting to tell me jokes.

36:48.806 --> 36:53.678
If you see any vegetables,
will you lettuce know?

36:53.744 --> 36:57.548
No wonder Dan hardly fucking pulls.

37:13.164 --> 37:15.766
Me and Holly are ready
for speed dating.

37:15.833 --> 37:19.370
The Cock Capturers are going to
capture some kind of cock tonight.

37:21.839 --> 37:24.976
So, would you say you wear
your heart on your sleeve?

37:25.042 --> 37:30.081
My heart is hidden deep down inside,
and I don't know where it is.

37:30.147 --> 37:31.616
I don't really have one.

37:31.682 --> 37:34.885
Two minutes is not a long time.
How the fuck is this awkward?

37:34.952 --> 37:36.320
Nice to meet you. I'm Dan.

37:36.387 --> 37:39.523
My plan is simple.
What are your interests?

37:39.590 --> 37:42.760
Ask loads of questions...
I like to sing, dance and act.

37:42.827 --> 37:45.930
Why don't you do X Factor?
...act interested...

37:45.997 --> 37:48.132
Anything else?
...you can't go wrong.

37:48.199 --> 37:50.201
Nice to meet you. See you later.

37:50.267 --> 37:53.938
See you later. You look beautiful.
She can have a fucking tick.

37:54.005 --> 37:56.207
Why haven't I done this before?
Yes.

37:56.273 --> 37:59.810
Speed dating is pointless to me.
You get two minutes.

37:59.877 --> 38:01.345
Tell me your life story.

38:01.412 --> 38:04.415
What's your name? Where you from?
What do you work as?

38:04.482 --> 38:07.084
You're just staring at their tits.
Seven.

38:07.151 --> 38:08.619
I'm on my second boy,

38:08.686 --> 38:12.623
and he comes over and takes a seat,
and I've got loads of good questions.

38:12.690 --> 38:15.259
You tell me something interesting.

38:15.326 --> 38:19.130
The first one is, "Tell me something
interesting about yourself."

38:19.196 --> 38:20.364
About me?
Yeah.

38:20.431 --> 38:23.000
I just hate myself.
You hate yourself?

38:23.067 --> 38:25.803
That wasn't the answer
I was kind of expecting.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.605
He hates his self.

38:27.672 --> 38:30.441
Now I don't feel like
this is a speed dating thing.

38:30.508 --> 38:32.643
It's more like a counselling session.

38:32.710 --> 38:35.646
There's lots of good things
about you, Thandor.

38:35.713 --> 38:38.482
Name one.
Your hair is so cool.

38:38.549 --> 38:40.685
I'm lying. You get a tick.

38:40.751 --> 38:41.786
Yeah?
Yeah.

38:41.852 --> 38:43.421
It was a sympathy tick.

38:43.487 --> 38:46.157
Try and learn to love yourself.

38:46.223 --> 38:48.159
I'm Scott, babe. Nice to meet you.

38:48.225 --> 38:51.562
This is the easiest thing ever.
I can talk for England.

38:51.629 --> 38:54.098
I can talk to an orange
about a fucking apple.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.767
What if I don't want you to leave?
You got to tick.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.036
I hope I get a fucking tick.

38:59.103 --> 39:01.205
I can hear the boxes getting ticked.

39:01.272 --> 39:05.142
She's not going anywhere, her, like.
She's staying with Scotty.

39:05.209 --> 39:07.945
It's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

39:08.012 --> 39:11.582
Who's the worst speed dater,
and who's the champion?

39:11.649 --> 39:14.919
Holly, one. And Dan, four
What?

39:14.985 --> 39:17.688
So, I've got more matches
than Gaz and Scott.

39:17.755 --> 39:21.859
Just proves, sitting down
and listening to a girl

39:21.926 --> 39:24.562
will beat the Buck Squad
any day of the week.

39:24.628 --> 39:26.363
One tick!

39:26.430 --> 39:29.100
You know what?
I'm better at blow jobs.

39:29.166 --> 39:31.068
Let's go.

39:31.135 --> 39:34.338
Hopefully, me and Holly
will have better luck in the club.

39:34.405 --> 39:37.441
Everyone knows that's the
only place you pull, anyway.

39:46.383 --> 39:49.720
It's Tuesday, which means one thing,
we're going to Koos.

39:49.787 --> 39:51.021
Everyone's buzzing.

39:51.088 --> 39:54.892
Gotta make sure you're looking sharp,
and we're gonna get on it.

40:10.207 --> 40:11.609
It's Koosday tonight,

40:11.675 --> 40:16.680
which means game on between
Cock Capturers and team Buck Squad.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.521
You've got the Cock Capturers
and the Buck Squad.

40:23.587 --> 40:25.623
I couldn't give a fuck who wins.

40:25.689 --> 40:28.392
I'm just gonna sit back
and watch it kick off.

40:37.134 --> 40:40.638
You've got the Cock Capturers,
you've got the Bucking Squad.

40:40.704 --> 40:42.907
I don't know who's gonna
come out on top.

40:48.646 --> 40:49.680
I can't believe it.

40:49.747 --> 40:52.883
The girls are beating
the lads at their own game.

40:57.888 --> 40:59.924
Right now, the girls are winning.

41:01.725 --> 41:04.528
We've done it!
We've been in the club five minutes,

41:04.595 --> 41:08.732
and me and Holly have already pulled.
One-nil to Cock Capturers.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.802
Fair play to the girls,
they've got off the mark quick.

41:11.869 --> 41:14.371
But I'll still beat them
to the finish line.

41:16.807 --> 41:19.944
This whole competition
is all a major cover up.

41:20.010 --> 41:24.048
It's really all about
me and Gary and the war between us.

41:24.114 --> 41:26.851
I see a bird, I get her over,
I take her home.

41:26.917 --> 41:28.719
That's what I call speed dating.

41:30.120 --> 41:34.325
I see Gary leave with a girl,
but weirdly, I don't care.

41:34.391 --> 41:38.696
I've got Graeme, and hopefully,
I'll be capturing his cock later.

41:43.868 --> 41:47.037
A date. A date! An actual date!

41:49.573 --> 41:52.676
This means I can't buck him.
What the fuck am I gonna do?

41:52.743 --> 41:56.180
I need to buck now tonight,
so Graeme's gonna have to fuck off.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.449
I need to find someone else.

42:07.758 --> 42:09.693
Graeme has politely fucked off.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.763
I've found someone else to bang.
He's game.

42:15.399 --> 42:17.601
Charlotte has pulled,
and so has Holly.

42:17.668 --> 42:19.403
They're bringing the boys back.

42:22.039 --> 42:24.742
I need to get back to the house
as soon as possible,

42:24.808 --> 42:26.710
so that it's still neck to neck.

42:31.415 --> 42:33.284
I come back with me bird.

42:35.552 --> 42:38.222
But Charlotte and Holly
have both got lads back.

42:38.289 --> 42:41.458
Both people out of the
Cock Capturers have pulled.

42:41.525 --> 42:45.362
Whereas only one of the Buck Squad
have. I'd say that was one-nil.

42:46.931 --> 42:50.868
I'm showing my boy our fish,
but we're both not bothered.

42:50.935 --> 42:53.938
The only fish he wants to see
is the one between me legs.

42:54.004 --> 42:57.041
And that's where we're going now,
to do all of the sex.

42:58.275 --> 43:01.979
# I'm going down on the cock
I'm getting low on the cock

43:02.046 --> 43:05.149
# I'm going down, I'm getting low
I'm going down on the cock

43:06.784 --> 43:10.220
It's impressive for the girls
to get lads back to bed

43:10.287 --> 43:13.424
without passing out,
being sick, or pissing on them.

43:13.490 --> 43:17.161
I've had sex in the house,
and Gary's had sex in the house.

43:17.227 --> 43:19.129
And it's all weirdly OK.

43:19.196 --> 43:22.766
And there's been no kick-offs,
no arguments and no tears.

43:22.833 --> 43:24.969
This is getting fucking strange.

43:27.571 --> 43:29.974
Me and Gary think we're in Amsterdam

43:30.040 --> 43:32.543
Fuck, this isn't Amsterdam.
What the fuck?

43:32.609 --> 43:36.213
How am I meant to work with Holly
when I'm not even speaking to her?

43:36.280 --> 43:38.582
It was the fact
I'd lost you as a friend.

43:38.649 --> 43:41.051
We get back to the house,
there's fireworks.

43:41.118 --> 43:43.320
That's what you said to me!
(girl moans)

43:43.387 --> 43:44.922
All the lads have got a bird.

43:44.989 --> 43:47.424
Mine's the one
getting plucked tonight.

43:47.491 --> 43:49.493
