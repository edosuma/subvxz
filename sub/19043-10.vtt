10:36.891 --> 10:39.791
Dale, with your
business acumen,

10:39.793 --> 10:44.128
You'll be able to help us
with the business side of it.

10:44.130 --> 10:46.897
And the girls will have
a summer job.

10:46.899 --> 10:50.967
And chip will add
the toppings.

10:50.969 --> 10:53.903
And I'll come by
every once in a while.

10:53.905 --> 10:56.372
