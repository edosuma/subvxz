Previously onMacGyver...Take this,

00:04.091 --> 00:06.267
and then make sure
you bring it back to me.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.924
Get down!

00:11.968 --> 00:13.361
What the hell is going on?

00:13.404 --> 00:15.102
And who is this guy wearing
my George Washington mask?

00:15.145 --> 00:17.191
Stay.I still don't know your name.

00:17.234 --> 00:18.714
Murdoc.Dad!

00:18.757 --> 00:20.455
Daddy has to make a quick stop.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.065
JILL:
Hello?

00:22.109 --> 00:23.632
Jill

00:23.675 --> 00:25.503
Heard you been looking for me.

00:25.547 --> 00:26.765
Jill.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.463
MURDOC: Someone told me
you're back in town.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.943
I really do hope
we can see each other.

00:40.953 --> 00:44.000
[Murdoc whistling
"Home on the Range"]

01:01.974 --> 01:03.846
I can't believe
you still have this thing.

01:03.889 --> 01:06.762
Frankly, I can't believe
you're still living here.

01:16.815 --> 01:18.991
:
Hello, MacGyver.

01:20.645 --> 01:21.951
We really got to go
through the motions?

01:21.994 --> 01:23.692
We both know how this
is gonna end, okay?

01:23.735 --> 01:25.259
No matter how many blows
you land,

01:25.302 --> 01:28.262
I'm gonna pull out my gun, and
you'll do exactly what I say.

01:28.305 --> 01:29.785
How about we just
skip to that part, huh?

01:29.828 --> 01:31.134
Okay!

01:34.181 --> 01:36.922
Any chance I could
get a glass of water?

01:36.966 --> 01:39.142
If you're gonna kill me,
do it now. Don't drag it out.

01:39.186 --> 01:42.711
Kill you? I'm not here
to kill you, MacGyver.

01:42.754 --> 01:44.626
I'm here
'cause I need your help.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.716
So I guess that's a no
on the water, huh?

01:51.502 --> 01:54.853
See, my son Cassian
was kidnapped.

01:57.029 --> 01:59.162
Yeah.
One of the members

01:59.206 --> 02:02.165
of my failed little
Collective took him.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.863
Thought you killed all of them.

02:04.907 --> 02:07.953
Oh, I tried.
But wouldn't you know?

02:07.997 --> 02:12.871
The one guy whose ticket
I didn't punch nabs my kid.

02:12.915 --> 02:15.700
I should have
started with him, hmm?

02:16.745 --> 02:18.877
Is this filtered?

02:18.921 --> 02:22.794
Are we here to talk about
my water or your son?

02:22.838 --> 02:26.320
Cassian's kidnapper
is a guy named Benjamin Liu.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.191
Liu's former Chinese
secret police.

02:28.235 --> 02:31.194
Very dangerous.
He's very violent.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.631
The things I used
to respect about him.

02:33.675 --> 02:37.418
Anyhoo, Liu's ransom demand
just came in.

02:37.461 --> 02:40.899
$5 million, or Cassian dies.

02:40.943 --> 02:43.859
You have $5 million.
Why not pay the ransom?

02:43.902 --> 02:45.687
Paying him
won't bring Cassian home.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.167
This isn't about money.

02:47.210 --> 02:50.344
Liu is trying to lure me out
so he can execute me.

02:50.387 --> 02:53.042
Then go save your son.
You're more than capable.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.175
Thanks for the compliment,
Boy Scout.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.177
But, see, I went to do
that very thing yesterday,

02:57.220 --> 02:59.048
and it turns out Liu is keeping
Cassian in a place

02:59.091 --> 03:00.615
that might as well
be a fortress.

03:00.658 --> 03:06.011
You are the magic key that's
gonna unlock all the doors.

03:06.055 --> 03:08.275
No, I'm not.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.538
This is about Jill, isn't it?

03:10.581 --> 03:12.540
I knew my killing her

03:12.583 --> 03:14.716
was gonna be
a sticking point for you.

03:14.759 --> 03:18.067
But we are talking about
an innocent child, MacGyver.

03:18.110 --> 03:21.113
You really gonna let
a ten

03:22.767 --> 03:25.770
You see? Knew you were gonna be
on the fence about this.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.556
I appreciate
your position.

03:28.599 --> 03:30.253
It's a toughie.

03:30.297 --> 03:33.604
But you see, MacGyver,
I care about you so much

03:33.648 --> 03:37.782
that I went ahead
and made it a lot easier

03:37.826 --> 03:40.220
for you to make your decision.

03:50.099 --> 03:52.884
I knew that would help you
change your mind.

03:58.455 --> 04:01.502
♪

04:24.699 --> 04:27.397
You get the text from Mac, too?That's why I'm here.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.138
So he calls a meeting,
then doesn't show up?

04:29.181 --> 04:30.966
Hola, amigos.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.316
Where's Mac?

04:33.360 --> 04:35.231
He just texted me
to meet him in the war room.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.102
What, he's not here yet?

04:37.146 --> 04:39.801
This is weird. I am calling him.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.586
Went right to voice mail.

04:45.676 --> 04:47.025
Well, that's got to be
him right there.

04:47.069 --> 04:49.506
Nobody has
this number but us.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.160
Hey, what's up, man?

04:51.203 --> 04:52.988
Mac

04:53.031 --> 04:55.251
Hey, guys. Sorry, I got
to leave town for a while.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.992
I got to go do something
with someone.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.341
What's going on, dude?

04:58.385 --> 05:00.169
MURDOC:
"Someone"? Come on, MacGyver.

05:00.212 --> 05:02.389
I'm not just someone.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.521
Hello, team Phoenix.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.262
Boy, have I missed you guys.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.872
Especially you, Bozer.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.657
What are you doing
with that lunatic?

05:09.700 --> 05:10.701
MURDOC:
Now, now, now, Jack.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.703
There's no need
for name-calling.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.401
I was just about to get to that.

05:14.444 --> 05:17.099
See, MacGyver and I, we're going
on a little road trip.

05:17.142 --> 05:18.361
Just the two of us.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.363
None of you are invited.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.452
Murdoc's son has been kidnapped.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.454
So I'm gonna go help him
find Cassian.

05:24.498 --> 05:26.413
I knew you guys would be worried

05:26.456 --> 05:29.459
when I didn't show up for work,
but trust me: I'll be fine.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.156
But I need you guys to promise

05:31.200 --> 05:33.898
that none of you
will come looking, okay?

05:33.942 --> 05:36.901
No one in this room
is gonna agree to that, Mac.No way.

05:36.945 --> 05:39.382
I promise not to kill him,
so long as you all stay

05:39.426 --> 05:42.080
very, very far away.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.039
Mm

05:44.082 --> 05:45.823
But I catch so much
as a whiff of a tail

05:45.867 --> 05:49.131
or Jack trying
to sneak up on me,

05:49.174 --> 05:51.481
I'm gonna break that promise.
Are we clear on the rules?

05:51.525 --> 05:53.048
I don't follow your rules, 'Doc.

05:53.091 --> 05:56.225
Jack, do not follow me. Promise.

05:56.268 --> 05:58.096
I'm serious.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.098
Yeah...

06:00.142 --> 06:02.840
Did we just enter
The Twilight Zone?

06:02.884 --> 06:04.538
Why in the hell would he
be working with Murdoc?

06:04.581 --> 06:06.844
The only way Mac would go
anywhere with Murdoc

06:06.888 --> 06:08.063
is if he didn't have a choice.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.238
What are you saying, Matty?

06:09.281 --> 06:10.500
I'm saying that I think Murdoc

06:10.544 --> 06:12.023
has someone
that Mac cares about.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.938
Nasha.

06:15.287 --> 06:17.333
Bozer.On it.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.640
I ran a trace.
They're in Long Beach.

06:19.683 --> 06:22.556
Long Beach. Okay, good, good.
Matty, tac team.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.471
Hold on, Jack.

06:24.514 --> 06:25.689
Dalton, stand down.

06:25.733 --> 06:28.475
Hey, he's in real danger
right now, Matty.

06:28.518 --> 06:29.650
Do you not get that?

06:29.693 --> 06:30.912
But you heard what he said.

06:30.955 --> 06:32.479
And we don't have
all the info yet.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.742
Solomon said Nasha got on
a plane yesterday

06:34.785 --> 06:36.091
headed for L.A.

06:36.134 --> 06:38.572
Mac didn't say anything
to me about Nasha

06:38.615 --> 06:41.052
coming to Los Angeles.That's 'cause he didn't know
she was coming.

06:41.096 --> 06:42.402
RILEY:
Look.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.491
Someone mirrored Mac's phone
and was texting Nasha

06:44.534 --> 06:45.753
pretending to be him.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.319
Murdoc catfished Nasha.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.453
We can't go
after MacGyver

06:50.497 --> 06:52.673
until we've taken away
Murdoc's leverage.

07:00.811 --> 07:04.032
MacGYVER: You're sure this is
where Liu is keeping Cassian?

07:04.075 --> 07:05.120
Oh, yes.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.600
My sources were highly motivated

07:06.643 --> 07:08.297
to tell the truth.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.212
Said he's being held
on the first floor.

07:10.255 --> 07:12.649
Looks municipal.
Former federal building?

07:12.693 --> 07:14.564
Former Russian consulate.
The Russkies fled

07:14.608 --> 07:16.479
after the Soviet Union
collapsed.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.960
The building changed hands
for several years,

07:19.003 --> 07:22.006
and Liu acquired it.

07:22.050 --> 07:26.663
Okay, Boy Scout,
time to do your thing.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.491
Dazzle me.

07:32.321 --> 07:34.236
MacGYVER: Well, Liu has
surveillance cameras

07:34.279 --> 07:35.846
covering every
ground-level approach,

07:35.890 --> 07:37.848
which means our best bet is
going to be a breach from below.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.110
It's a consulate,
which means that

07:39.154 --> 07:40.808
there should be
a secret escape tunnel

07:40.851 --> 07:43.332
or a rabbit hole that diplomats
would use in case of attack.

07:43.375 --> 07:46.335
It does, indeed. If my sources
are to be believed--

07:46.378 --> 07:47.815
and again, they were

07:47.858 --> 07:50.513
highly motivated
to tell me the truth...

07:52.123 --> 07:53.647
...the tunnel's
been plugged for decades

07:53.690 --> 07:55.170
with over seven feet
of poured concrete.

07:55.213 --> 07:57.172
Not even you
could quietly

07:57.215 --> 07:59.827
get us through that
with the amount of time we have.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.959
So?

08:03.395 --> 08:05.354
Really?

08:05.397 --> 08:08.183
You're stumped?

08:08.226 --> 08:13.493
Hate to say it, MacGyver,
but #disappointed.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.277
What about the windows?

08:17.061 --> 08:18.280
What is it?

08:18.323 --> 08:21.457
There were guards everywhere
the other day.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.719
Where are the guards?

08:25.113 --> 08:27.724
I don't think walking right up
to the front gates

08:27.768 --> 08:30.640
in full view of all these
cameras is a great idea.

08:36.690 --> 08:39.388
Evil before beauty.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.570
That explains it.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.877
Double tap to the chest.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.008
Single to the head.

08:51.052 --> 08:53.315
That's quality work.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.144
You smell that?

08:56.187 --> 08:57.841
I don't smell anything.

08:57.885 --> 09:00.670
Come on.

09:00.714 --> 09:01.932
It's chemical.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.543
It's probably the ammo.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.415
That stiff just had
a recent lead transfusion.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.721
No, it's not cordite.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.549
It's something else.

09:11.376 --> 09:14.075
Look, none of these men had
their weapons drawn.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.077
Whoever did this caught
them by surprise.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.345
He was here.

09:25.086 --> 09:28.959
Whoever killed these
men has my son.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.617
What?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.750
Nothing. I just...

09:36.793 --> 09:39.709
think I caught a little human
emotion on your face there.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.624
Any of these dead guys Liu?

09:41.668 --> 09:42.930
Uh, no.

09:42.973 --> 09:46.107
Well, then,
isn't it possible that Liu

09:46.150 --> 09:48.370
escaped with Cassian before
the shooter could get to him?

09:48.413 --> 09:50.459
Let me see that little
knife of yours.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.287
Wait.Chop-chop, Boy Scout.

10:08.259 --> 10:10.653
What are you doing?

10:10.697 --> 10:12.742
Ballistics analysis.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.878
Hand-pressed 45 grain
hollow point.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.271
So?

10:20.315 --> 10:22.926
So I know who killed these men,

10:22.970 --> 10:25.537
who has my son.Who?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.323
My wife.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.724
Okay, I got behind
the phone Mac used

10:37.767 --> 10:40.509
to call the Phoenix, and I found
a ton of files, including this.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.946
Help!

10:42.990 --> 10:44.600
Help, please!

10:44.644 --> 10:46.254
Son of a bitch.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.691
Please, help!

10:51.302 --> 10:53.696
That's why Mac
agreed to help.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.307
Riley, can you tell
where this was recorded?

10:56.351 --> 10:58.440
No. Metadata's been stripped.

10:58.483 --> 11:01.269
We have no earthly idea
where Nasha is. This-this...

11:01.312 --> 11:03.358
Hold on. I think
I got something.

11:08.276 --> 11:11.105
That's him.MATTY: 9:17 a.m.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.629
That what time Nasha
left LAX with Murdoc.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.370
Riley, what time did
Mac call the Phoenix?

11:15.413 --> 11:16.458
10:49 a.m.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.808
So taking into account
drive time,

11:18.852 --> 11:21.724
that leaves Murdoc
roughly 45 minutes

11:21.768 --> 11:25.075
from the moment he picked up
Nasha to stash her somewhere.

11:25.119 --> 11:28.644
Okay, so 45 minutes means
this is our search area.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.779
That-that-that's half
the city, including downtown.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.345
And all we
have to go on

11:34.389 --> 11:38.349
is that Nasha's in a room
with one cinderblock wall.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.655
That's like every
hipster apartment

11:39.699 --> 11:41.352
in 60 square miles.Yeah, I know, right?

11:41.396 --> 11:42.963
Yeah, well, it's all
we've got right now,

11:43.006 --> 11:44.529
so everybody
needs to get

11:44.573 --> 11:45.922
their head in the game.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.663
Now,

11:47.707 --> 11:50.710
what do we know that can help us
to shrink that circle?

11:51.798 --> 11:52.973
Okay, Murdoc
would need to control

11:53.016 --> 11:54.583
the location
where he stashed Nasha.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.324
He'd want to be close
to freeways.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.152
And he wouldn't want
any neighbors.

12:00.545 --> 12:01.764
I know Murdoc
is good,

12:01.808 --> 12:03.679
but how the hell did he
set this up so fast?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.159
Hey, I have an idea.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.682
Why don't we sit in here
and do nothing?

12:06.726 --> 12:08.292
Stop it.

12:08.336 --> 12:09.990
Okay, Matty, I'm sorry, but
let's do something, anything.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.687
Let me get out of here. Come on.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.733
Fine. Start a grid search
at the airport

12:13.776 --> 12:16.213
and work your way out
from there. Go.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.824
Yeah, let's go.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.354
Well, guess
who was right.

12:26.397 --> 12:29.313
Five days ago,
my darling wife, Amber,

12:29.357 --> 12:31.663
escaped from the Serbian prison
she called home.

12:31.707 --> 12:34.101
Whatever happened
to Cassian's mom being dead?

12:34.144 --> 12:37.408
I lied.
That really surprise you?

12:37.452 --> 12:39.933
Only thing that surprises me
is someone agreed to marry you.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.239
She was in the same
line of work.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.981
We had a similar passion
for homicide.

12:45.025 --> 12:48.028
Anyway, how the hell did she get
into this building?

12:48.071 --> 12:52.815
I don't know. That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.122
And you're certain that
Amber won't just call you

12:55.165 --> 12:56.471
and tell you everything's okay?

12:56.514 --> 12:59.430
Cassian's safe, he's with her?
Where he is?

12:59.474 --> 13:02.912
We tried the whole co-parenting
thing. Didn't really take.

13:02.956 --> 13:05.219
Can't imagine why.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.743
Here's a little tidbit,
Christopher Robin,

13:07.787 --> 13:09.397
if we're
being chatty.

13:09.440 --> 13:13.096
Most people don't like sarcasm.
I do, but if you're gonna dig,

13:13.140 --> 13:15.098
use something else.

13:15.142 --> 13:16.839
All right.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.494
You said you'd release Nasha
after Cassian was safe.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.757
Well, problem solved.
He's with his mom. He's safe.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.976
Now, let her go!

13:23.019 --> 13:26.675
Safe? This woman is me
but with a temper.

13:26.718 --> 13:29.243
And what happens if she slips up
and goes to prison again?

13:29.286 --> 13:30.679
What happens
to Cassian?

13:30.722 --> 13:32.202
I don't know. Just call her
and work something out.

13:32.246 --> 13:33.595
The last time
that I brought up

13:33.638 --> 13:35.553
custody with her,
she said she'd cut my eyes out

13:35.597 --> 13:37.033
if I mentioned it again.

13:37.077 --> 13:40.515
This is the most messed-up
child custody battle ever.

13:40.558 --> 13:43.997
Which is why I really, really
need you to get my son back.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.870
So, come on, time to
shine, Boy Wonder.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.654
Bring me my son,
and don't forget

13:49.698 --> 13:51.482
Nasha's life still
depends on it.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.662
Why do you keep doing that?

13:57.706 --> 13:59.142
I know what it is.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.978
What are we looking for?Diplomats' escape tunnel.

14:09.022 --> 14:11.763
I told you it's plugged up.Yeah, you did.

14:11.807 --> 14:14.027
Oh, God, what is
that awful smell?

14:14.070 --> 14:16.420
Highly concentrated
muriatic acid.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.031
How the hell
did it get down here?

14:18.074 --> 14:20.337
Your wife brought it.

14:22.992 --> 14:26.082
It's how she got into
the consulate undetected.

14:26.126 --> 14:28.650
Most people who paid attention
in science class

14:28.693 --> 14:30.652
know concrete is alkaline,

14:30.695 --> 14:33.655
which means even a weak acid
will eat away at it,

14:33.698 --> 14:37.050
but spray a strong acid,
like muriatic acid,

14:37.093 --> 14:40.183
on the surface, and the porous
substance will liquefy.

14:40.227 --> 14:42.751
Scrape away the sludge,
reapply the acid,

14:42.794 --> 14:46.407
and you can eat your way through any amount of concrete,

14:46.450 --> 14:48.583
so long as you have
lots of acid

14:48.626 --> 14:50.628
and lots of patience.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.990
It would have
taken her hours

15:04.033 --> 15:06.818
to cut through
this much concrete.
Truth.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.298
I used to respect that
about her.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.170
She could take hours
to murder somebody.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.563
I never had that kind
of patience.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.797
Well, unless she left a trail
of Reese's Pieces, we're done.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.017
And things are about
to get a whole lot worse

15:31.060 --> 15:33.802
for your little Nasha.Oh, no, we're not done yet.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.809
That's it.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.954
are looking to expand
our company south,

15:54.997 --> 15:56.825
and we're interested in learning
more about your bank.

15:56.868 --> 15:57.913
And what business are you in?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.784
Waste removal.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.962

of course.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.257

how he would respond.

this together so fast.

where he was gonna put Nasha

23:24.490 --> 23:28.189
Yeah, that nutcase has gone
by a lot of different names.

23:28.232 --> 23:29.625
35 that we know of,
but only one of them's

23:29.669 --> 23:31.932
got a commercial real estate
license in L.A. County.

23:31.975 --> 23:33.586
MATTY:
"Brian Paiement."

23:33.629 --> 23:36.197
And he's got a piece of property
just north of L.A.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.590
RILEY:
It's close to the freeways,

23:37.633 --> 23:38.808
it's away from prying eyes,
and it's got

23:38.852 --> 23:40.027
a large warehouse on the lot.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.202
That's got to be it.

23:41.245 --> 23:42.856
Jack, I'm texting
you the address.

23:43.770 --> 23:44.858
Okay, we're on our way.

23:44.901 --> 23:46.773
Nice work, you two, nice work.

23:55.085 --> 23:56.739
MacGYVER: Getting our hands
on $30 million

23:56.783 --> 23:59.525
in under 48 hours
would be a challenge

23:59.568 --> 24:01.396
even under the best
circumstances,

24:01.440 --> 24:03.920
but given the fact
the cops are now looking

24:03.964 --> 24:06.488
for the two dudes
who just held up a bank...

24:06.532 --> 24:08.272
Been reaching out
to my contacts.

24:08.316 --> 24:09.926
There are no jobs
paying 30 mil.

24:09.970 --> 24:13.060
There's only one way to get
this much money this quickly.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.018
Steal it.
Steal it.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.411
Well, yeah,

24:16.455 --> 24:18.500
but who has that kind of cash
just lying around?

24:18.544 --> 24:21.242
You know, we're not that far
from Medellín.

24:21.285 --> 24:22.504
What, Reynaldo?

24:22.548 --> 24:24.550
He moves tens of millions
every day.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.073
You killed Reynaldo.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.248
:
Oh, no, no.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.467
I killed Jose.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.730
That was you? Oh...

24:32.122 --> 24:34.037
Everyone was talking
about that one.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.735
My God, you killed him,
what, with the,

24:35.778 --> 24:37.432
one of the little
golf pencils, right?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.216
Well, technically,
it was two little golf pencils,

24:39.260 --> 24:41.523
but yeah, that was me.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.307
That's impressive, Cookie.

24:43.351 --> 24:44.918
Thank you.

24:44.961 --> 24:46.223
Who's Reynaldo?

24:46.267 --> 24:47.616
He washes cash

24:47.660 --> 24:49.444
for over a third of the scumbags
in South America.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.012
His armored truck
drives around Medellín

24:52.055 --> 24:54.841
doing pickups from his various
cash businesses.

24:54.884 --> 24:56.973
And when he's done
with today's pickups,

24:57.017 --> 24:58.801
we'll be there
to steal the truck.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.717
Welcome to the dark
side, Boy Scout.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.379
Drop the keys!

25:11.422 --> 25:13.512
Keep those hands
where I can see them, boys.

25:16.036 --> 25:17.167
As I was saying.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.604
Do you know
who you're robbing?

25:18.647 --> 25:21.084
Whom."Do you know
whom you are robbing?"

25:21.128 --> 25:22.695
And, yes, we do.
Now, shut up

25:22.738 --> 25:25.132
and sit quietly, or your day
is gonna come to a messy end.

25:25.175 --> 25:26.481
I don't mean to
rush your process,

25:26.525 --> 25:28.222
but we do need to hurry.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.659
Hold the gun port
on that side with that.

25:34.968 --> 25:38.624
When a large volume of air
is forced into a small space--

25:38.667 --> 25:40.843
say, the back
of an armored truck--

25:40.887 --> 25:42.279
the pressure inside builds.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.631
Are you sure this is gonna work?

25:45.674 --> 25:46.936
Wait for it.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.068
Seal the gun ports
with burning thermite,

25:48.111 --> 25:50.331
continue to pump in air,

25:50.374 --> 25:52.507
and eventually the pressure
will become too great

25:52.551 --> 25:53.987
for the closed system, and...

25:56.380 --> 25:57.991
...the weakest point will give.

25:58.034 --> 26:01.255
You've broken so many
laws today, MacGyver.

26:01.298 --> 26:04.127
I am beyond impressed.

26:04.171 --> 26:05.825
Just hold up your end
of the deal,

26:05.868 --> 26:08.610
or the last one I break

26:08.654 --> 26:09.959
is gonna be putting you
into the ground.

26:20.883 --> 26:22.406
MacGYVER:
Okay.

26:22.450 --> 26:25.235
We are just under 700 pounds,

26:25.279 --> 26:27.411
but we're over
$31 million. We're good.

26:28.456 --> 26:30.414
We have your money, Liu.

26:30.458 --> 26:33.417
Where's the location
for the exchange?

26:33.461 --> 26:37.117
You ever get the feeling
everything happens for a reason?

26:37.160 --> 26:39.423
Like, in a cosmic sense?

26:39.467 --> 26:43.123
Yeah, I'm not really, I don't
know, into discussing philosophy

26:43.166 --> 26:45.081
with the man who's using
my girlfriend's life

26:45.125 --> 26:47.518
to blackmail me,
so let's just finish this.

26:47.562 --> 26:50.260
I keep feeling like maybe
this whole ordeal

26:50.304 --> 26:52.611
could be a second chance
for me and Amber.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.091
You want to hear
about how we first met?

26:55.135 --> 26:56.266
No.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.834
It was a chilly
evening in Moscow.

26:58.878 --> 27:00.836
The sunset sparkled
off the spires

27:00.880 --> 27:02.969
of Saint Basil's
Cathedral.

27:03.012 --> 27:07.451
As I peered through the scope
on my M40 sniper rifle,

27:07.495 --> 27:12.369
I spied a glint of gunmetal
on the adjacent rooftop.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.328
And there she was,

27:14.371 --> 27:17.636
a vision in
tactical body armor,

27:17.679 --> 27:20.464
aiming at my mark. She was
trying to snake my hit.

27:22.815 --> 27:26.340
We both fired at the same time.
Our slugs hit simultaneously.

27:26.383 --> 27:28.951
Afterward, we couldn't
agree on whose kill it was,

27:28.995 --> 27:31.127
so, you know, we decided
to split the money

27:31.171 --> 27:33.347
and a bottle of vodka.

27:33.390 --> 27:36.306
Your first date started
with a homicide?

27:36.350 --> 27:38.657
Maybe prison did give
her a change of heart.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.659
She seems different.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.486
When we get
Cassian back,

27:42.530 --> 27:47.317
I don't know, maybe there's
a future for the three of us.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.276
On the lam, of course.

27:49.319 --> 27:51.408
Is that really the life
you want for your son?

27:51.452 --> 27:53.976
Children belong
with their parents.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.675
I mean, you of all people
should understand that.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.764
Yeah. Stable ones.

27:58.807 --> 28:01.723
That doesn't include you
and, uh,

28:01.767 --> 28:03.899
Bride of Frankenstein
over there.

28:03.943 --> 28:05.379
Ouch.

28:05.422 --> 28:08.121
If I were you, I'd want
a safe environment for my son.

28:08.164 --> 28:11.733
Oh, yes, with the white picket
fences, the latte shops.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.474
Turn on the news, Boy Scout.

28:13.517 --> 28:15.519
No place is safe
for anyone anymore.

28:15.563 --> 28:17.696
Maybe, but you can
reduce the risk.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.306
We can help.

28:19.349 --> 28:23.527
You and your band
of merry do-gooders

28:23.571 --> 28:25.747
want to raise my son?

28:25.791 --> 28:27.880
Anything to get him
away from you.

28:27.923 --> 28:29.882
AMBER:
Got the location

28:29.925 --> 28:32.101
for the exchange.

28:32.145 --> 28:35.017
It's a bit of a drive.
We should hit the road.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.334
Jack? I think I found her.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.817
Man, if Mac was here,
he'd know how to...

28:56.473 --> 28:58.084
Hey, hang on, now.
Bozer, you know Murdoc.

28:58.127 --> 28:59.738
There's no way
he'd make it this easy.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.348
I'm surprised the door
wasn't booby-trapped.

29:01.391 --> 29:02.523
I got to think of something.

29:02.566 --> 29:03.654
Give me your shoe.

29:04.699 --> 29:06.527
Are you... are you serious?

29:06.570 --> 29:09.269
Are you a team player?
Come on, let's go.

29:13.403 --> 29:14.883
Yep.

29:14.927 --> 29:16.755
I knew it. He's got
one of his automatic toys

29:16.798 --> 29:18.844
guarding the place. Okay.

29:18.887 --> 29:20.933
Give me your other shoe.Man...

29:24.893 --> 29:26.286
All right, you look left,
I'll look right.

29:26.329 --> 29:28.114
It's like getting a sniper
to expose his position

29:28.157 --> 29:29.289
by giving him a target.

29:29.332 --> 29:30.856
You get it, yeah?

29:33.772 --> 29:36.209
There. Up in the rafters.
That's where it's firing from.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.427
Now we know where
it is, but how

29:37.471 --> 29:38.602
do we get up there
and disarm it?

29:38.646 --> 29:39.778
I'll handle it.

29:53.269 --> 29:54.314
All clear.

29:54.357 --> 29:56.272
Nasha, can you hear me?
It's Bozer.

29:56.316 --> 29:59.623
Bozer?
Please, get me out of here.

30:03.149 --> 30:04.280
BOZER:
Uh, Jack?

30:04.324 --> 30:05.978
What's that sound?

30:09.329 --> 30:10.809
The rifle's booby-trapped.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.289
Disarming it must have
triggered something else.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.117
Nasha, what's going on in there?

30:15.161 --> 30:16.597
I don't know.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.469
Jack!

30:19.513 --> 30:20.862
The air's being sucked out.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.603
We got to free her
before she suffocates.

30:24.344 --> 30:26.476
What would Mac do?
What would Mac do"

30:26.520 --> 30:28.304
That's the question
you should be asking yourself.

30:28.348 --> 30:30.350
Okay, I have an idea,
but you're gonna have

30:30.393 --> 30:31.568
to move away from that thing.

30:31.612 --> 30:32.700
Tell Nasha to sit tight.

30:34.528 --> 30:35.659
Nasha, don't move.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.139
We're gonna get you out, okay?

30:37.183 --> 30:39.141
Hurry.

30:39.185 --> 30:41.491
It's getting hard to breathe.

30:53.982 --> 30:55.157
Jack?

30:55.201 --> 30:56.637
Don't worry, I'm gonna
get you out of here.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.247
It's gonna
be all right.

30:58.291 --> 31:01.424
It's okay. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on. I got you.

31:01.468 --> 31:04.036
Come on.

31:04.079 --> 31:07.735
Matty, we got Nasha.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.563
She's safe.

31:31.193 --> 31:32.455
Where's Cassian?

31:32.499 --> 31:35.241
First the money, then the boy.

31:35.284 --> 31:36.285
It's all here.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.157
Go ahead.
Look for yourself.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.172
We're good.

31:53.215 --> 31:54.434
All right. You have your money.

31:54.477 --> 31:55.522
Now, where's the kid?

31:55.565 --> 31:56.958
He's a quarter mile
down the road

31:57.002 --> 31:58.090
in an abandoned tire plant.

31:58.133 --> 31:59.569
If he is hurt

31:59.613 --> 32:03.269
even one little bit,
you know I'll find you.

32:03.312 --> 32:04.661
No need for threats.

32:04.705 --> 32:06.054
The boy is in
perfect health.

32:06.098 --> 32:07.926
Pleasure doing
business with you.

32:07.969 --> 32:10.319
Now, if you'll excuse me,

32:10.363 --> 32:13.061
we need to get going.

32:15.803 --> 32:16.978
Cookie.

32:18.458 --> 32:19.894
Shall we?

32:23.158 --> 32:25.987
Amber, why did he
just call you "Cookie"?

32:26.031 --> 32:27.858
Thanks for the
cash, Cupcake.

32:27.902 --> 32:29.643
And the laughs.

32:29.686 --> 32:31.732
Felt like old times.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.170
What about Cassian?

32:37.216 --> 32:40.219
You wanted him. He's yours.

32:46.399 --> 32:48.401
[vehicle doors closing,
engines starting]

32:57.236 --> 32:59.586
So much for
reconciliation.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.464
How could she do this?

33:08.508 --> 33:10.597
Was it for money?

33:10.640 --> 33:11.772
"Till death do us part."

33:11.815 --> 33:13.034
That's what she said.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.296
I'm gonna make that true.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.429
Look, as long as
Cassian's safe, we've won.

33:16.472 --> 33:17.865
Thanks for the
insight, Boy Scout.

33:17.908 --> 33:19.519
I don't need
your words of wisdom.

33:19.562 --> 33:22.261
I just need you to let me
know when Cassian's safe.

33:34.229 --> 33:36.275
♪

33:45.458 --> 33:48.809
Sorry, honey,
but I need closure.

34:00.342 --> 34:01.561
MacGYVER:
Cassian!

34:01.604 --> 34:03.128
Cassian!

34:03.171 --> 34:04.955
CASSIAN:
In here! I'm in here!

34:04.999 --> 34:06.392
Hold on one second, okay?

34:17.620 --> 34:19.318
Where's my dad?He's close by.

34:19.361 --> 34:20.928
And you're gonna
see him very soon.

34:20.971 --> 34:22.930
You're safe now.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.055
Ah...

35:01.099 --> 35:04.406
I need you to step away
from the vehicle, please.

35:04.450 --> 35:06.713
Come on. Hands!

35:10.151 --> 35:12.675
Listen, Murdoc,
we can work something out.

35:13.633 --> 35:14.895
T-Take the money.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.810
Shh.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.643
MacGyver, do you have Cassian?

35:23.686 --> 35:25.514
MacGYVER :
I got him. He's okay.

35:25.558 --> 35:27.864
Excellent news.
Well, not for you.

35:35.655 --> 35:39.528
Not much surprises me anymore,
but you just did.

35:39.572 --> 35:42.836
I'm no one's moral
compass, Amber, but...

35:42.879 --> 35:46.361
Seriously, what the
hell's wrong with you?

35:46.405 --> 35:49.103
I guess I wasn't cut out
for motherhood.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.236
Is that really so surprising?

35:54.195 --> 35:55.805
Just get it over with.

35:59.069 --> 36:00.375
Pull the trigger, Cupcake.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.247
I should, Cookie.

36:04.336 --> 36:08.166
God, I really should,
but I won't.

36:08.209 --> 36:13.997
Well, you always were
so sentimental.

36:14.041 --> 36:16.609
Oh, this isn't about you.

36:16.652 --> 36:19.220
You are dead to me.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.874
It's about Cassian.

36:20.917 --> 36:24.094
I can't tell my son
that I killed his mother.

36:24.138 --> 36:26.227
Then what happens now?

36:26.271 --> 36:27.489
You disappear.

36:27.533 --> 36:29.883
You never go near
Cassian again.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.928
Because if you do,

36:31.972 --> 36:34.104
I think you know
what will happen.

36:34.148 --> 36:38.065
You think you're fit
to raise a child?

36:38.108 --> 36:41.547
Actually, no. But...

36:41.590 --> 36:44.071
Thanks to this little
jaunt down memory lane,

36:44.114 --> 36:47.161
it's become quite clear to me
what's best for our son.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.815
What does that mean?

36:48.858 --> 36:50.425
None of your concern.

36:53.298 --> 36:55.213
Run along, now.

37:13.013 --> 37:14.275
Dad!

37:16.973 --> 37:20.020
Oh! Hey.

37:20.063 --> 37:22.283
Oh, buddy.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.807
I was so worried about you.

37:24.851 --> 37:26.026
Are you okay?

37:27.070 --> 37:28.985
You don't look so good.

37:29.029 --> 37:31.901
I'm fine. Inside.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.686
Now that I know you're okay.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.818
Where's Mommy?

37:37.472 --> 37:39.300
That's a good
question.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.781
Mom had to go
on a business trip, a...

37:41.824 --> 37:43.826
very long one.

37:45.524 --> 37:47.569
The biological got away.

37:47.613 --> 37:50.703
But Liu and his
friends didn't.

37:50.746 --> 37:53.575
I got the money back, too.

37:53.619 --> 37:55.577
You also got Cassian back.

37:55.621 --> 37:57.536
I think it's time you upheld
your end of the bargain.

37:58.798 --> 38:01.322
There's no need.

38:01.366 --> 38:04.934
Your friends proved
more than capable.

38:06.501 --> 38:09.591
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

38:09.635 --> 38:12.420
NASHA: Jack...

38:12.464 --> 38:14.117
I'm surprised
you didn't go

38:14.161 --> 38:15.858
on this business
trip with her.

38:15.902 --> 38:17.295
Stay here one second, pal.

38:24.432 --> 38:27.000
I've been thinking
about what you said.

38:27.043 --> 38:31.004
Our little guy would be
safest with your people.

38:32.048 --> 38:34.312
I want what's best for my son.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.839
That is, if you think
Matilda would be open

38:39.882 --> 38:41.449
to an arrangement.

38:43.277 --> 38:44.887
He goes into
federal protection.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.239
You go into federal custody.

38:53.374 --> 38:54.506
Fine.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.117
I suppose we can
make that work.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.954
♪

39:11.087 --> 39:15.396
Oh, my two favorite people
in the whole wide world.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.745
You here to take
me to my new home?

39:16.789 --> 39:18.094
Not quite yet.

39:18.138 --> 39:20.532
Your cell at the supermax
is still being prepared.

39:20.575 --> 39:23.535
We've come to tell you that
Cassian has been officially

39:23.578 --> 39:25.101
placed in a loving home.

39:25.145 --> 39:27.103
With a family that
will give him a chance

39:27.147 --> 39:28.409
at a normal life.

39:31.107 --> 39:34.110
Well, Matilda,
from the bottom of my heart...

39:36.112 --> 39:37.287
Thank you.

39:38.463 --> 39:39.638
Now, what's his address?

39:39.681 --> 39:40.900
I'm gonna need it to
stay in touch with...

39:40.943 --> 39:42.423
Never gonna happen.

39:42.467 --> 39:43.946
MATILDA:
But...

39:43.990 --> 39:46.819
if you're a stellar inmate--

39:46.862 --> 39:50.083
and I mean stellar--

39:50.126 --> 39:54.479
then perhaps I can arrange
a heavily supervised visit.

39:54.522 --> 39:56.916
Heavily supervised.

39:56.959 --> 39:58.265
Thank you.

39:58.308 --> 40:00.963
Of course you're invited, too,
Boy Scout.

40:01.007 --> 40:04.576
I mean, Cassian sees
you like an uncle now.

40:04.619 --> 40:07.448
Which makes us like brothers.

40:07.492 --> 40:10.451
You come across as pure evil,

40:10.495 --> 40:14.107
a dark and twisted soul, but...

40:14.150 --> 40:16.892
I think there's a shred of
humanity still left in there.

40:18.981 --> 40:21.593
You say that
to the man who killed Jill

40:21.636 --> 40:23.769
and abducted Nasha.

40:23.812 --> 40:26.728
That's true, but if
you hadn't let me

40:26.772 --> 40:28.469
call Phoenix after
you grabbed me,

40:28.513 --> 40:30.471
they never would
have found Nasha.

40:30.515 --> 40:34.170
So I'm wondering if a part
of you wanted them to save her.

40:36.521 --> 40:38.610
You always were
a smart one, MacGyver.

40:38.653 --> 40:41.569
Knew I should have never
given him that damn phone.

40:41.613 --> 40:43.658
:
Oh, well.

40:43.702 --> 40:45.617
We made a fantastic
team, didn't we, pal?

40:45.660 --> 40:47.270
Maybe we could do
it again sometime.

40:48.315 --> 40:49.359
No.

40:52.667 --> 40:55.496
Well, my door
will always be open.

40:55.540 --> 40:56.889
Not technically.

40:56.932 --> 40:58.978
Technically, my door's
gonna be locked real tight.

40:59.021 --> 41:00.980
But metaphorically,
metaphorically,

41:01.023 --> 41:03.286
my door will always be open
to you, MacGyver,

41:03.330 --> 41:04.853
when you need my help.

41:12.687 --> 41:13.732
Oh, Angus.

41:15.037 --> 41:17.692
Please tell the GF it
was nothing personal.

41:17.736 --> 41:22.784
Even Lois Lane knew the dangers
of dating Superman.

41:24.699 --> 41:27.223
So should Nasha.

41:31.576 --> 41:33.447
♪

41:48.549 --> 41:50.943
Nasha, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

41:53.249 --> 41:54.816
I'm fine, Angus.

41:56.470 --> 41:58.385
It's over.

41:59.429 --> 42:02.476
Everything's
going to be okay.
