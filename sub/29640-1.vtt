00:55.577 --> 00:57.709
- Do it.
- All right.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.843
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

01:00.886 --> 01:02.410
How did you do that, bro?

01:02.453 --> 01:03.498
Charlie.

01:03.541 --> 01:04.846
The Mexican demon named Charlie.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.501
A Mexican demon named Charlie?

01:06.544 --> 01:08.111
- Yes.
- You mean Carlos?

01:11.897 --> 01:14.857
Oh. What, Vic? Come on, bro.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.293
Busted, man.

01:18.774 --> 01:21.081
Come on, man. It's just a game.

01:21.124 --> 01:23.083
It's a stupid game, jeez.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.911
Sad! What do you have
to say for yourself?

01:26.999 --> 01:29.219
You guys wanna try something
with a little more kick?

01:30.481 --> 01:31.482
Like what?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.271
You can thank my dear cousin
for this hookup.

01:37.836 --> 01:39.142
What's that?

01:40.491 --> 01:41.971
No, man.

01:42.276 --> 01:44.016
This thing first killed a kid
in the '90s

01:44.060 --> 01:45.844
- named Charlie Grimille.
- Oh.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.499
- Grimille, right?
- Yeah.

01:48.543 --> 01:51.937
And after that, his spirit
started popping up everywhere.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.548
- I'm gonna like this.
- Yeah.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.246
So, the real Charlie challenge
is...

01:56.290 --> 01:57.813
Okay, wait, wait.
We're going live.

01:57.856 --> 01:58.988
Okay.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.213
"The year is 1710."

02:06.778 --> 02:08.911
And yet, if I knew
it was the last year

02:08.954 --> 02:10.608
"of the life which is mine..."

02:15.439 --> 02:18.964
"I am but a lowly peasant..."

02:20.009 --> 02:22.054
and I, too, long
for something more.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.406
More than the life
my mother gave me.

02:26.537 --> 02:30.367
"She bestowed upon me the name
August Benjamin Rutherford."

02:30.411 --> 02:32.282
Whoa.

02:33.544 --> 02:34.719
Vic, how are you doing that?

02:34.763 --> 02:36.156
Whoa. It is scary.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.959
- I ain't doing it, guys.
- Victor, man, come on.

02:37.983 --> 02:39.483
What do you mean
you're not doing that?

02:39.507 --> 02:41.509
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean no one...

02:41.552 --> 02:42.553
Whoa.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.906
- Marcus?
- That that Charlie thing?

02:47.950 --> 02:49.734
Marcus is freaking
messing around.

02:49.778 --> 02:50.953
Marcus? God, man!

02:50.996 --> 02:52.563
It's just Marcus
screwing around.

02:52.607 --> 02:53.956
Scott, I didn't do that, dude.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.305
Hey, you saw what happened.

02:55.784 --> 02:58.308
Marcus, what the f...
Come on, man.

02:58.352 --> 02:59.353
Vic.

03:11.408 --> 03:12.453
Marcus.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.760
Help me clean this mess up.

03:32.168 --> 03:33.256
Marcus.

03:36.172 --> 03:37.521
You down here?

04:09.727 --> 04:10.728
Marcus.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.730
What are you doing?

04:14.341 --> 04:15.342
Hey.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.484
You all right?

04:49.506 --> 04:50.855
Hey.

05:10.266 --> 05:11.267
Marcus!

05:36.858 --> 05:39.382
Whoa!

05:40.992 --> 05:41.993
Whoa!

05:43.778 --> 05:45.127
- Stop doing that.
- Woo!

05:45.388 --> 05:47.564
Uh, yeah, Dad.

05:48.217 --> 05:50.741
Hey, Rubies, it's Auna Rue.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.309
Super exciting day today,
because I've hit

05:53.353 --> 05:56.094
a million followers.

05:56.486 --> 05:59.054
Just kidding.
There's like 200 of you,

05:59.097 --> 06:01.491
um, but maybe someday...

06:02.492 --> 06:04.015
there will be more.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.931
Anyways, uh,
other big news today.

06:06.975 --> 06:09.586
In an hour, I'm moving
into Lisa's place.

06:09.630 --> 06:12.981
And tomorrow morning
is my first day

06:13.024 --> 06:14.374
at Fellbrook High School.

06:14.852 --> 06:16.027
Fellbrook High School.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.159
It's like...

06:17.725 --> 06:19.030
the greatest school ever.

06:19.074 --> 06:21.555
Uh, their drama program
is insane.

06:21.816 --> 06:22.817
Fun fact:

06:23.383 --> 06:25.733
Craig and Kate Parker
went there,

06:25.776 --> 06:27.822
only two of, like, the biggest
Broadway stars

06:27.865 --> 06:29.389
who probably have
a million followers.

06:29.432 --> 06:30.694
I'm so excited.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.262
And, uh, it's gonna be awesome.

06:33.305 --> 06:36.178
It's gonna be really awesome
and I'm happy

06:36.221 --> 06:38.398
and excited to share it
with you.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.312
Anyways, uh, rambling.

06:40.356 --> 06:43.490
I'll have more very, very, very,
very, very soon.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.519
Hey, you!

07:16.697 --> 07:17.872
How was the ride?

07:18.133 --> 07:19.351
It was good.

07:24.879 --> 07:25.880
Wow.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.665
I love all the vintage...

07:29.100 --> 07:32.060
and the bodies.

07:32.103 --> 07:33.627
Thanks.

07:34.715 --> 07:35.846
Gunner.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.979
I missed you so much.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.459
Sorry. One sec, okay?

07:39.502 --> 07:40.764
All right, no worries.

07:41.635 --> 07:42.636
Hey, dog.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.923
- Crazy busy, huh?
- Yeah.

08:08.966 --> 08:11.534
This big show
is just kicking my butt,

08:11.578 --> 08:13.797
- but it's good.
- Yeah.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.451
Your whole line on display!

08:16.887 --> 08:17.888
Yeah.

08:21.457 --> 08:22.589
What is that?

08:22.850 --> 08:24.634
That's Guymon the Gargoyle.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.680
He keeps the bad spirits away.

08:27.071 --> 08:29.509
That's funny.

08:33.294 --> 08:34.905
Uh, so where should put
my stuff, roomie?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.820
Um, you can put it
just back there to the left.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.342
Um, I'm actually
gonna be staying

08:38.386 --> 08:39.972
out in the studio leading up
to the show.

08:39.996 --> 08:41.956
I'm just gonna be working late.
It'll be easier.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.740
Oh. Yeah, of course.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.786
But it'll be cool,
you know what I mean?

08:45.829 --> 08:48.005
You'll have the whole place
to yourself for a while.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.833
So cool, so cool.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.488
I'm sorry, this is never ending.
I really have to take this.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.011
Hey, I'm so sorry.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.360
- No, no, no...
- Thank you.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.710
My sister just got here. Yeah.

10:11.436 --> 10:12.829
It's been three years

10:12.873 --> 10:13.873
and two children, Daniel.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.113
I didn't ask for this
when we got married.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.878
Your son needs you.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.227
I need you.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.620
It's gonna be fine!

10:20.663 --> 10:22.491
I think it's a good monologue.

10:23.231 --> 10:25.973
It's a Bertolt Brecht play,
it's perfect for you guys.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.583
I think you should do it.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.256
Uh, we got to get...
We got to get moving.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.499
Okay, everybody.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.022
Let's get it together.

10:32.675 --> 10:33.676
All right.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.635
- James P?
- Here.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.462
- Crystal?
- Here.

10:37.811 --> 10:38.812
Oh.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.118
Auna...

10:41.858 --> 10:44.556
Auna Rue? Our new student?

10:44.774 --> 10:45.819
Here.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.168
Oh. Welcome.

10:47.603 --> 10:48.648
Okay, guys.

10:49.213 --> 10:51.694
Many of you already know this,

10:51.738 --> 10:55.698
but I will repeat it
for our new thespians.

10:57.961 --> 11:03.227
NYU Tisch School of the Arts'
top scout,

11:03.271 --> 11:05.360
good friend of mine,
Scott Lamont,

11:05.882 --> 11:07.579
will be stopping by here

11:07.623 --> 11:09.103
later in the semester.

11:10.104 --> 11:13.498
So, we will focus solely
on our fall monologues

11:13.542 --> 11:15.718
and those are gonna serve as
your audition pieces.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.982
So, I need you guys to bring
your A-game

11:19.026 --> 11:21.550
because this is
a big opportunity.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.683
As I've always said,
what have I said before?

11:23.726 --> 11:26.729
You can have all the talent
in the world in here.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.775
What does it matter unless
they see it out there?

11:28.818 --> 11:30.690
You got one shot,
one opportunity.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.430
Are you quoting Eminem?

11:34.041 --> 11:35.869
Hey, hey. No, I'm quoting me.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.523
You know, I was background
in 8 Mile.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.395
Okay?

11:41.048 --> 11:42.527
All right.

11:42.571 --> 11:43.703
Who wants to go first?

11:46.923 --> 11:47.968
Um, Mr. Schlake?

11:48.272 --> 11:49.273
Can I?

11:49.839 --> 11:51.798
Eager beaver.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.887
Are you sure you don't wanna

11:53.930 --> 11:55.778
take a little more time
to workshop some material?

11:55.802 --> 11:57.412
No, I... I have something.

12:00.807 --> 12:01.895
Mm-hmm.

12:14.385 --> 12:16.300
Empress of Thayolund.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.176
Shh!

12:23.481 --> 12:24.482
Shh!

12:25.962 --> 12:27.398
Mom, Dad, look. I'm a princess.

12:27.442 --> 12:28.791
Shh! Auna, be quiet.

12:34.623 --> 12:38.148
No one can see my greatness
because it shines from within.

12:51.814 --> 12:52.814
Um...

12:54.643 --> 12:56.210
None of this mattered.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.170
Today, I live for me...

13:01.519 --> 13:03.260
and today, I can...

13:04.000 --> 13:05.480
die for...

13:07.699 --> 13:09.745
- Stop it.
- Um...

13:10.006 --> 13:12.530
- Look.
- Auna, stop it.

13:15.490 --> 13:16.621
Auna?

13:17.361 --> 13:18.928
Why don't we stop there for now?

13:19.581 --> 13:22.714
And you can revisit the material
and keep working on it, okay?

13:50.307 --> 13:52.005
Sorry, someone's in here.

14:16.768 --> 14:17.769
No!

14:23.384 --> 14:24.646
Sarah!

14:24.689 --> 14:26.169
If you do this,

14:26.778 --> 14:29.956
no one will see your greatness.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.218
Yes.

14:33.176 --> 14:35.178
No one can see my greatness

14:35.222 --> 14:37.180
because it shines from within.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.141
No one need remember me

14:41.924 --> 14:43.970
because it doesn't matter.

14:45.406 --> 14:46.973
None of this mattered.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.758
I know that now.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.022
Today, I live for me.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.113
And today, I can die for him.

15:13.477 --> 15:16.350
I went in, dude.
Just knee-deep, did not care.

15:18.613 --> 15:19.677
Grabbed and snatched it
right out of the sky.

15:19.701 --> 15:20.658
What were you on last week?

15:20.702 --> 15:22.008
Yo, why are you pouting?

15:22.051 --> 15:24.488
- Still sad about Gina?
- He totally is.

15:24.532 --> 15:25.925
- No.
- No?

15:26.534 --> 15:27.752
Well, well, well.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.319
It's my main man, Don.

15:29.363 --> 15:30.668
- The ladies' man.
- Hey, man,

15:30.712 --> 15:32.322
you still rocking
that V-card, though?

15:32.366 --> 15:33.628
Oh, man. I heard the ladies

15:33.671 --> 15:35.325
can't get their hands
off of him.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.153
Yeah,
when you rock this pink shirt,

15:37.197 --> 15:39.547
- I mean, why not?
- It's just rewiring.

15:39.590 --> 15:40.983
Oh, heartbreaking.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.333
- Let me get her number.
- Shut up.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.248
No, she was shallow, though.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.033
Come on, man.
It could work out well.

15:47.076 --> 15:49.383
You're just like
a regular stand-up guy.

15:49.426 --> 15:51.385
- I could take a few lessons...
- Hey, Don.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.388
Uh, we're still on
for tonight, right?

15:55.737 --> 15:57.739
Because, uh, I was thinking
about coming over

15:57.782 --> 15:59.654
around 8:00,
if that's okay with you.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.356
- Y... Yeah, it... It still works.
- Cool.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.705
- See you, Don.
- Yeah.

16:07.749 --> 16:08.837
We'll see you later, Stick.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.581
Let her go, man.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.236
It sucks
it didn't work out, bro.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.586
- You have to...
- Yo.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.504
- Hey.
- Uh, hi.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.028
I was about to do the whole

16:26.072 --> 16:28.030
randomly-bump-trays-
with-the-new-girl,

16:28.074 --> 16:30.076
but, uh, I thought
it might be a little...

16:30.119 --> 16:32.426
- Little cliché.
- Yeah.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.429
- I'm Cade.
- I'm...

16:35.472 --> 16:37.344
Auna. Right?

16:38.475 --> 16:40.564
Yeah. How did you know that?

16:40.608 --> 16:43.698
I maybe saw you on stage today.

16:44.525 --> 16:45.917
Oh, God.

16:45.961 --> 16:47.571
Oh, God. Okay...

16:47.615 --> 16:48.964
Hey, it's fine. It's fine.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.835
Oh, believe me,
it was... It was not fine.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.011
No, seriously.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.621
Well, I've heard that class
is tough.

16:53.664 --> 16:57.277
Um, honestly, I don't think
I fit in here.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.018
Ah, it's not such a bad thing.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.196
You know, what you did
over there.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.547
For Don? That was pretty cool.

17:06.589 --> 17:07.896
You saw that?

17:11.551 --> 17:14.250
Well, it was...
It was really nice meeting you.

17:16.861 --> 17:17.862
Yeah.

17:18.428 --> 17:19.603
I'll talk to you later?

17:20.387 --> 17:21.518
If you're lucky.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.653
Okay.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.461
- What are you waiting for?
- What happened over there?

17:31.485 --> 17:32.485
What was that?

17:34.879 --> 17:36.490
"If you're lucky"?

17:39.623 --> 17:40.711
Enough.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.120
"The year is 1710."

18:41.642 --> 18:42.773
And yet, if I knew,

18:42.817 --> 18:44.166
it was the last year of the life

18:44.210 --> 18:45.254
which is mine...

18:45.298 --> 18:47.735
"August Benjamin Rutherford."

18:49.084 --> 18:50.129
It's really scary.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.304
Victor, man, come on.

18:51.782 --> 18:52.914
What are you doing?

19:10.584 --> 19:11.585
Hi.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.110
Um, I'm looking for a stage play
called The Gallows.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.330
Let's see. I don't think
we have that,

19:17.373 --> 19:19.332
but you're welcome to check
very quickly.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.944
Stage plays are aisle three,
on the right.

20:28.183 --> 20:30.272
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.795
But we're closed.

20:32.579 --> 20:33.928
But I just...

20:39.629 --> 20:42.545
I'm sorry. Um, can I...

20:45.548 --> 20:47.202
I called you five times, Auna.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.291
- I'm sorry.
- It's been an hour.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.487
- I was in the library.
- And you didn't hear your phone

20:51.511 --> 20:52.642
in the library?

20:54.340 --> 20:56.472
Lisa, I'm sorry. Okay?

20:56.516 --> 20:58.953
I just... I got caught up
reading a play.

21:15.796 --> 21:20.017
So, if you like scary stuff,

21:20.061 --> 21:23.760
I'm trying something called...

21:23.804 --> 21:25.240
Charlie Challenge.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.895
By the way, we could see...

21:28.678 --> 21:30.201
some craziness.

21:38.949 --> 21:42.736
"Sorrow, torment, pain."

21:42.779 --> 21:44.825
Fear with every breath.

21:48.045 --> 21:50.047
I am never alone,

21:50.396 --> 21:52.180
wanted am I,

21:52.223 --> 21:54.791
hunted am I.

21:56.184 --> 21:57.185
Ruin...

21:58.491 --> 22:00.014
"beckons me."

22:14.289 --> 22:15.464
Okay.

22:15.508 --> 22:18.902
Maybe you guys saw something
that I didn't.

22:19.512 --> 22:23.690
But, uh, I hope you enjoyed
my Charlie Challenge.

22:48.192 --> 22:49.280
Yes?

22:50.760 --> 22:52.738
Hey, can I borrow your charger?
Gunner chewed up mine.

22:52.762 --> 22:53.763
Uh, yeah.

22:54.590 --> 22:56.984
I just, um... I need it back

22:57.027 --> 22:59.900
because my computer's
on its death-bed.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.031
Good night.

23:31.584 --> 23:32.933
You slept in.

23:35.152 --> 23:36.327
Crap, my book.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.068
Auna, I'm gonna be late.

23:38.112 --> 23:40.462
Oh, you took your spirit
protector thing down?

23:42.116 --> 23:43.247
No.

23:57.174 --> 23:59.829
Okay, 232
in your books, everyone. Two...

24:02.919 --> 24:07.446
And we're gonna be talking about
three inventors in particular.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.578
Thomas Edison,
Christopher Sholes,

24:09.622 --> 24:11.101
Alexander Graham Bell.

24:11.145 --> 24:14.583
Obviously, Thomas Edison,
the electricity light bulb.

24:15.062 --> 24:19.370
Christopher Sholes invented
the typewriter in 1867,

24:19.414 --> 24:21.068
and Alexander Graham Bell,

24:21.677 --> 24:24.593
the telephone in 1876, okay?

24:24.637 --> 24:26.377
So, in a very short period
of time,

24:26.421 --> 24:27.659
the world is changing
very quickly.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.468
We have light bulbs,
we have typewriters,

24:29.511 --> 24:30.817
and we have...

24:32.732 --> 24:35.212
Okay. And see,
that's what you did.

24:35.952 --> 24:38.955
So, you notice
she changed her tactics...

24:40.174 --> 24:42.002
right when it...

24:44.570 --> 24:46.789
Silence the phones

24:46.833 --> 24:49.313
and witness the magic, people!

24:49.705 --> 24:51.925
All right, who's next?

24:53.317 --> 24:54.536
I'll go.

24:54.580 --> 24:55.711
Auna.

24:55.755 --> 24:57.452
I... You went yesterday, yes?

24:57.496 --> 24:58.671
I'd like to go again.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.197
Well, we don't...

25:20.040 --> 25:21.302
Sorrow...

25:24.740 --> 25:25.872
torment...

25:28.091 --> 25:29.092
pain...

25:31.965 --> 25:32.966
fear...

25:34.402 --> 25:36.186
With every breath,

25:38.928 --> 25:41.757
dost thou know such
malevolent anguish?

25:43.759 --> 25:47.633
For I, I am never alone.

25:51.332 --> 25:54.596
Wanted am I.

25:57.207 --> 26:00.646
Hunted am I.

26:01.951 --> 26:05.564
Ruin beckons me.

26:13.223 --> 26:15.486
Shall I seek
the one I love again?

26:18.620 --> 26:19.926
I call out...

26:22.711 --> 26:25.845
but the darkness,
it answers not.

26:28.717 --> 26:32.678
Yea, the hangman's noose

26:33.548 --> 26:37.073
raises the hairs on my limbs

26:37.117 --> 26:41.208
and quaketh the depths
of my marrow.

26:41.251 --> 26:46.909
Yea, even strike the very fear
of death unto my soul.

26:51.348 --> 26:52.828
He cometh...

26:55.918 --> 26:57.267
for me.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.832
It's two different people,
honestly, like, you know...

27:20.856 --> 27:22.379
- No, but seriously though...
- Thanks.

27:22.423 --> 27:23.816
How did you memorize your lines?

27:23.859 --> 27:25.295
Auna! Hey.

27:25.339 --> 27:26.906
Hmm, good luck.

27:28.603 --> 27:29.778
Hi, Cade.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.693
This makes me lucky, right?

27:31.737 --> 27:33.390
Hey, you talked to me twice.

27:33.434 --> 27:36.132
Oh. Oh, yeah.

27:36.176 --> 27:39.135
Yeah, you're basically winning
the lottery right now.

27:43.662 --> 27:47.535
Hey, um, there's this
really good ice cream place

27:47.578 --> 27:49.058
that I bet you haven't been to.

27:49.102 --> 27:50.538
You doing anything
tomorrow night?

27:50.581 --> 27:52.671
Uh, yes, yes.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.498
Oh, okay, yeah,
maybe some other time.

27:54.542 --> 27:57.153
Oh, wait, no, no, no.
I... I... I mean yes to the date,

27:57.197 --> 28:01.462
uh, slash hangout or whatever.
Did you say date?

28:01.505 --> 28:03.029
You did not say date.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.466
I'm sorry, uh,
I'm saying date but...

28:05.509 --> 28:07.903
Hey, it's a date.

28:10.166 --> 28:11.385
Let me give you my number.

28:12.081 --> 28:13.082
Okay.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.000
Uh, sorry, it's still off
from theater.

28:18.044 --> 28:19.306
I'll wait.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.833
- Everything okay?
- Uh, yeah.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.530
Yeah, everything's fine.

28:27.793 --> 28:32.058
Ooh. Your phone is blowing up.

28:32.101 --> 28:35.931
- Sure you're not already booked?
- Uh, nope.

28:38.107 --> 28:40.022
- There you go.
- Thanks.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.724
- So, I'll see you tomorrow?
- If you're lucky.

29:05.352 --> 29:06.832
Oh, my God.

29:09.922 --> 29:10.923
What?

29:19.670 --> 29:20.671
Pain...

29:22.282 --> 29:24.632
fear with every breath...

29:26.112 --> 29:28.636
I bid thee...

29:28.679 --> 29:31.117
Dost thou know such
malevolent anguish?

29:32.335 --> 29:33.467
Verily...

29:59.406 --> 30:00.799
"Oh, my love..."

30:02.104 --> 30:03.889
How art thou unafraid?

30:04.672 --> 30:07.849
For the hangman cometh for thee,

30:08.632 --> 30:09.808
for us both.

30:12.201 --> 30:15.291
Yea, although I fear death,

30:15.335 --> 30:18.381
"I cannot abandon my love."

30:32.961 --> 30:34.006
Okay.

30:45.626 --> 30:46.801
Shit!

30:48.803 --> 30:50.457
Yeah, it'll all be done
by tomorrow,

30:50.500 --> 30:51.980
and I'm so sorry
about the delay.

30:53.808 --> 30:55.375
No, no, no,
I'm finishing up the sleeves

30:55.418 --> 30:56.506
and everything today.

31:00.815 --> 31:01.860
Thanks, Stacy.

31:10.390 --> 31:11.870
You got me.

31:13.393 --> 31:14.698
Oh, hey, Mom.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.876
Uh, no, I haven't seen anything.

31:18.354 --> 31:20.095
Hold on a second.
Let me pull it up.

31:27.189 --> 31:28.189
No, don't worry.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.760
Yeah. I'll talk to her.

31:34.022 --> 31:35.415
I love you, bye.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.027
I don't know what happened.

31:40.637 --> 31:44.163
I don't know if it was just like
adrenaline pumping or what.

31:44.206 --> 31:47.296
I... Mr. Schlake and everyone
even applauded.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.864
Well, ice cream toast.

31:50.604 --> 31:52.649
- What are we toasting?
- To you.

31:58.133 --> 31:59.453
So what happened
in the first one,

31:59.874 --> 32:01.136
the first audition?

32:01.571 --> 32:03.617
Because that was really bad.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.925
- Do you want me to leave?
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding...

32:06.968 --> 32:08.796
- Do you want me to leave?
- No, no.

32:08.839 --> 32:11.451
Uh, yeah, it was pretty bad.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.171
- You don't wanna talk about it.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.370
- No.
- It's fine, it's fine.

32:21.678 --> 32:25.856
I've wanted to be an actress
since I was really little.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.771
Your name up in lights
kind of thing?

32:27.815 --> 32:29.295
No, no, it was never that.

32:29.686 --> 32:30.966
That never even crossed my mind.

32:31.862 --> 32:32.863
I, um...

32:34.430 --> 32:36.128
I guess I just thought...

32:37.825 --> 32:42.786
maybe, if I had a chance someday
to, like, prove myself,

32:44.353 --> 32:46.399
I could make an impact.

32:48.531 --> 32:52.448
You know, like, do something
really important or timeless.

32:56.235 --> 32:58.106
But my parents and my sister...

32:58.150 --> 33:00.152
- You're just Auna.
- Mom!

33:00.195 --> 33:01.675
They never really got it.

33:01.718 --> 33:03.416
My greatness shines from within!

33:03.459 --> 33:04.634
Auna, stop it.

33:05.766 --> 33:06.985
Nobody did.

33:10.684 --> 33:14.905
And, uh, that comes back
to haunt me sometimes.

33:17.386 --> 33:19.127
But this
Charlie Challenge stuff,

33:19.171 --> 33:20.868
all the views and the followers,

33:22.087 --> 33:25.394
it just... It just feels weird
and very real.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.309
I know, but...

33:28.571 --> 33:29.746
is this Charlie stuff

33:30.095 --> 33:32.749
really gonna leave that impact
that you want?

33:33.098 --> 33:34.316
I don't know.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.711
But it's nice
to finally be seen.

33:41.367 --> 33:42.890
What's up, Mr. Hollywood?

33:42.933 --> 33:45.501
Hey! Just taking out
this lovely girl

33:45.545 --> 33:47.373
- for the best ice cream.
- Damn straight!

33:47.416 --> 33:48.461
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:48.504 --> 33:49.592
- I'm Auna.
- Auna.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.988
Did you know that you're on
a date with a superstar?

33:54.032 --> 33:55.642
Now, Wally, come on.

33:55.685 --> 33:57.644
- What?
- How's the folks doing?

33:58.775 --> 34:02.257
I ever tell you that I was
in a production with them once?

34:02.301 --> 34:03.954
Only every time I come in.

34:03.998 --> 34:05.782
Who were your parents?

34:06.174 --> 34:07.567
Oh, it... It's nothing.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.438
- It's not important.
- Cade.

34:09.482 --> 34:11.049
Girl. Hey,
you're gonna be surprised.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.051
Take a look at the picture
on that wall.

34:15.444 --> 34:16.445
No!

34:17.577 --> 34:19.840
Hey there, honey!
Come on in here.

34:19.882 --> 34:22.408
Oh, my God.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.149
This is insane.

34:24.714 --> 34:25.889
Um, I'm Auna.

34:25.933 --> 34:26.976
Nice to meet you, Auna.

34:27.021 --> 34:28.022
Oh, my God.

34:29.328 --> 34:30.068
Why didn't you tell me
your parents are actors?

34:30.110 --> 34:31.156
You never asked.

34:32.592 --> 34:33.873
I bet he didn't tell you
about his old dream, either.

34:33.897 --> 34:35.353
- Oh, Mom, please don't.
- No, she will.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.987
He played Little Ronnie Simmons

34:37.031 --> 34:39.164
on The Redenbachers
for two and a half seasons.

34:39.686 --> 34:41.166
- You did not.
- Oh, God.

34:41.208 --> 34:43.210
Oh my God, I see it, I see it.

34:43.255 --> 34:45.648
Our first Broadway opportunity
called for a pregnant woman.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.737
- We committed for the role.
- Oh, we committed.

34:48.172 --> 34:50.217
Oh, gross.

34:50.262 --> 34:53.699
Oh, that's just the story
we wanted to hear, Mom. Be nice.

34:53.743 --> 34:55.440
Eventually,
I just got tired of it.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.096
I got tired of having
it pushed on me.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.490
I know acting is what
they really want for me, but...

35:02.274 --> 35:03.275
Hmm.

35:04.711 --> 35:06.732
Sounds like your parents
would swap us if they could.

35:06.756 --> 35:09.194
Yeah.
You're probably not far off.

35:10.543 --> 35:12.936
Opposites attract though, right?

35:32.304 --> 35:33.740
Hey, do you want anything?

35:33.783 --> 35:36.699
Uh, yes. One Ronnie Simmons
lunchbox, please.

35:37.961 --> 35:39.963
Okay. Now, if this is
gonna be a thing,

35:40.007 --> 35:42.096
we're gonna have a problem.

36:25.270 --> 36:26.532
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry.

36:26.575 --> 36:28.229
We didn't mean to scare you.

36:28.273 --> 36:29.796
- We just, um...
- That's okay.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.493
- Is that her?
- Yeah, it's her.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.627
Could we get a quick picture?

36:36.194 --> 36:37.760
Yeah. Hi...

36:38.065 --> 36:40.285
Yeah, and another.
Yeah, one more.

36:41.416 --> 36:43.026
Okay, cool.

36:43.462 --> 36:45.551
Uh, we saw your
Charlie Challenge videos

36:45.594 --> 36:48.075
- and we totally subscribed.
- I subscribed first.

36:48.641 --> 36:49.859
Thanks, guys.

36:50.382 --> 36:52.340
It was so cool
that Charlie was, like,

36:52.384 --> 36:53.733
actually in the room with you.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.736
Yeah, I can't believe
he picked you.

36:57.258 --> 36:58.390
Wait, sorry, what are you...

36:59.695 --> 37:00.870
Uh, thanks.

37:00.914 --> 37:02.611
- Keep making Charlie videos.
- Thank you.

37:37.037 --> 37:40.345
Well, I hope my family
didn't freak you out too bad.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.390
Oh, uh, no.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.392
No, it was... It was awesome.

37:45.175 --> 37:46.525
Yeah, I thought so too.

37:49.179 --> 37:50.703
Just hold still.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.053
- What?
- You've got something.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.229
Oh, shoot.

38:13.508 --> 38:14.727
See you Monday?

44:21.746 --> 44:22.747
Lisa?

45:10.446 --> 45:11.491
God!

45:12.710 --> 45:14.102
God, Lisa!

45:14.929 --> 45:16.626
- Sorry.
- Was that you?

45:17.410 --> 45:19.064
What?

45:19.107 --> 45:21.762
- What are you doing awake?
- What are you doing awake?

45:24.809 --> 45:25.853
Auna, what?

45:27.768 --> 45:29.378
What happened to your hand?

45:29.901 --> 45:33.034
I... I slammed it in my closet.

45:35.907 --> 45:37.169
God.

45:40.476 --> 45:41.695
Are you okay?

45:42.130 --> 45:43.131
Yeah.

45:44.480 --> 45:45.525
Yeah.

45:45.917 --> 45:48.746
- Look, I talked with Mom, okay?
- God.

45:48.789 --> 45:50.922
And look, I agree with her,
all right?

45:50.965 --> 45:53.533
You're wasting your time
with all of this Charlie...

45:54.012 --> 45:55.361
garbage, I mean...

45:57.319 --> 45:58.756
What are you doing?

46:02.847 --> 46:04.500
Good night, Lisa.

46:04.849 --> 46:06.328
- Auna.
- Have fun playing dress up

46:06.372 --> 46:08.113
or whatever it is you do.

46:10.419 --> 46:11.507
Okay, good talk.

46:13.640 --> 46:18.297
Um... "Sorrow, torment, pain..."

46:21.256 --> 46:23.345
Jesus, what is it? Um...

46:24.303 --> 46:25.521
Are you okay?

46:25.870 --> 46:27.785
This isn't like
what you did before.

46:27.828 --> 46:30.091
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just a little off.

46:30.962 --> 46:32.964
- You sure?
- Yeah, um...

46:33.529 --> 46:35.270
"Yea, the hangman's..."

46:40.928 --> 46:42.147
Be right back.

46:43.496 --> 46:46.499
- Mr. Schlake?
- Yes, my starlet?

46:47.195 --> 46:49.763
Um, I've been doing
some thinking

46:49.807 --> 46:53.549
and, uh, I think
there's still some time

46:53.593 --> 46:55.029
to try another monologue.

46:55.334 --> 46:57.945
Oh, no, no, no, no,
listen, Auna,

46:58.772 --> 47:01.470
everyone's had doubts.
Heck, I've had doubts, right?

47:01.731 --> 47:04.299
And I know your confidence
in this particular material

47:04.343 --> 47:07.215
has dipped, but, Auna...

47:08.651 --> 47:10.262
people are gonna remember
this one.

47:11.132 --> 47:15.441
Just do whatever you did
last time. Okay?

47:17.922 --> 47:19.793
Sorry, what was that line?

47:22.013 --> 47:23.144
I'll see you.

47:47.952 --> 47:49.214
Where are we going?

47:49.257 --> 47:51.738
Uh, I just wanna
show you something. Come on.

48:07.580 --> 48:09.625
Not very many people
know about this.

48:10.757 --> 48:12.193
Uh, who built this?

48:12.237 --> 48:14.674
Nick did. But I helped a little.

48:16.241 --> 48:17.242
Oh, frick.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.200
Come on.

48:26.338 --> 48:27.600
It's cool, huh?

48:29.384 --> 48:33.127
This thing looks really janky.

48:40.395 --> 48:41.614
So...

48:42.658 --> 48:45.183
you bring all of your
lady friends up here?

48:45.226 --> 48:47.750
Yeah, only the tens, though.

48:49.752 --> 48:51.667
Although, there was Gina but...

48:51.929 --> 48:53.887
she was more like an 11, so...

48:56.368 --> 48:58.587
Ow! I was kidding.

48:59.153 --> 49:00.981
Are you okay?

49:01.025 --> 49:02.026
Yeah.

49:09.163 --> 49:12.601
I mean, she actually ended up
being really fake, you know.

49:14.777 --> 49:16.170
She's not as genuine as...

49:17.780 --> 49:18.956
some people.

49:28.313 --> 49:29.792
- What's this for?
- Hit record.

49:30.097 --> 49:32.491
- I need a partner in crime.
- Wait, what?

49:32.534 --> 49:34.188
I need to practice my monologue

49:34.232 --> 49:36.495
and the fans have been waiting
for a new video.

49:36.538 --> 49:38.105
So I thought we could do
something...

49:38.149 --> 49:41.761
Oh, Auna, come on. Not...
Like, is it that important?

49:43.110 --> 49:46.026
Yeah. Yeah,
it is... it is important.

49:46.548 --> 49:48.550
My fans are important
and so is the monologue.

49:48.594 --> 49:50.900
And if... I have to show them
I'm something, Cade.

49:50.944 --> 49:52.139
- You understand...
- Hey, hey.

49:52.163 --> 49:53.381
If I mess it up, it...

49:54.687 --> 49:55.688
I'm sorry.

50:00.519 --> 50:01.824
You'll do this.

50:08.831 --> 50:12.270
And maybe you don't see it,
but I do.

50:42.082 --> 50:43.127
I cannot...

50:43.823 --> 50:44.954
abandon my love.

50:48.958 --> 50:50.438
I cannot abandon...

50:50.743 --> 50:51.874
my love.

50:52.397 --> 50:55.095
I cannot abandon
right in front of...

50:57.576 --> 50:59.795
Cade?

51:00.535 --> 51:01.536
Cade?

51:04.974 --> 51:07.499
- I don't know what's happening.
- No!

51:12.243 --> 51:13.766
No! Stop, stop!

51:20.425 --> 51:22.514
- Are you okay?
- Me?

51:23.384 --> 51:24.820
Auna, you were choking.

51:26.344 --> 51:28.085
I thought
you were gonna pass out.

51:30.652 --> 51:31.653
Auna?

51:32.089 --> 51:33.394
Just tell me what's wrong.

51:33.438 --> 51:35.048
Cade, can you take me home?

51:36.005 --> 51:37.006
Right now.

51:39.922 --> 51:40.923
Yeah.

51:43.056 --> 51:44.057
Let's go.

52:36.065 --> 52:37.066
Ow.

54:43.671 --> 54:44.672
Auna!

54:46.021 --> 54:47.240
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

54:47.806 --> 54:50.112
Did you...

54:50.896 --> 54:52.071
I'm going to bed.

55:11.090 --> 55:12.221
Mr. Schlake?

55:13.048 --> 55:14.311
I need to switch monologues.

55:14.963 --> 55:16.530
I can't do Gallows anymore.

55:16.835 --> 55:18.184
Auna, that's not possible.

55:18.227 --> 55:19.490
- You're...
- Just let me give.

55:19.533 --> 55:20.641
Return to Thayolund another try.

55:20.665 --> 55:21.665
Just watch.

55:23.320 --> 55:25.496
I never saw him again
after that night.

55:28.020 --> 55:29.021
Marcus...

55:30.892 --> 55:33.330
I don't understand
what's happening.

55:34.635 --> 55:36.115
I can't think straight.

55:39.597 --> 55:40.685
I can't sleep.

55:43.078 --> 55:44.819
There's no one to talk to.

55:45.820 --> 55:46.908
Auna.

55:47.779 --> 55:48.910
Auna!

55:48.954 --> 55:50.172
Wait.

55:51.391 --> 55:52.871
I'm all alone.

55:55.613 --> 55:57.484
Except that I'm...

55:59.356 --> 56:00.531
never alone.

56:04.665 --> 56:08.713
Since that night, I've had this.

56:12.064 --> 56:13.195
He is everywhere.

56:13.239 --> 56:14.806
35th president
of the United States,

56:14.849 --> 56:16.329
John F. Kennedy...

56:18.418 --> 56:19.418
Auna?

56:20.638 --> 56:22.318
Would you mind reading
that section for us?

56:23.423 --> 56:26.078
The middle of 460 please.

56:29.864 --> 56:32.432
"In September 1961,
JFK signed the bill"

56:32.476 --> 56:34.086
enacting
the Disarmament Agreement,

56:34.739 --> 56:36.784
and lo the terrors
that consume me cometh

56:37.176 --> 56:40.353
"by the Hangman."

56:42.486 --> 56:44.618
- It's everywhere.
- Uh, I think you might be

56:44.662 --> 56:46.272
on the wrong spot.

56:47.229 --> 56:48.405
Try 470.

57:05.857 --> 57:07.249
I can't escape it.

57:17.564 --> 57:18.565
I feel...

57:19.740 --> 57:21.089
so hopeless...

57:25.442 --> 57:27.269
and so out of control.

57:32.753 --> 57:35.539
I don't know... I don't know...

57:37.366 --> 57:39.412
how much more I can take.

57:44.983 --> 57:45.984
Well done.

57:46.245 --> 57:47.942
You about
gave me a heart attack!

57:47.986 --> 57:49.640
Oh, good. Good.

57:50.467 --> 57:53.078
I'm so glad you decided to stick
with the Gallowspiece.

57:53.382 --> 57:54.708
- It's just dynamite.
- Wait. What?

57:54.732 --> 57:56.012
Scott's gonna be very impressed.

57:56.037 --> 57:57.648
Mr. Schlake,
can you help me real quick?

57:57.691 --> 57:59.476
Yeah. Stick to it.

58:00.172 --> 58:01.478
That spotlight calls.

58:59.623 --> 59:00.841
Auna?

01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:26.884
Animal control will be here

01:00:26.927 --> 01:00:28.189
to take care of the remains.

01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:30.539
You two just take care
of each other, okay?

01:00:30.975 --> 01:00:32.411
Thank you.

01:01:17.586 --> 01:01:20.807
Look at us.

01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:37.650
Wait.

01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:25.829
Why do you still have this?

01:02:28.788 --> 01:02:30.834
Lisa, stop.

01:02:31.399 --> 01:02:33.880
- No. Don't do that.
- Get this trash

01:02:33.924 --> 01:02:36.056
- out of my house.
- I can't believe you.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:39.016
This thing is hurting you,
it's hurting both of us.

01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:40.757
You don't know
anything about it.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.716
Oh, yeah? Auna, what...
What the hell is this then, huh?

01:02:44.064 --> 01:02:45.544
What, are you hurting yourself?

01:02:45.587 --> 01:02:46.763
Auna, please. Just tell me

01:02:46.806 --> 01:02:48.479
- what is going on.
- Oh, you care about me

01:02:48.503 --> 01:02:49.548
all of a sudden, huh?

01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:51.550
After treating me
like a stepsister

01:02:51.593 --> 01:02:53.465
- our whole lives?
- Auna, stop this.

01:02:54.988 --> 01:02:59.123
No, you got everything
from Mom and Dad.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:03.475
They supported you,
they believed in you.

01:03:03.518 --> 01:03:07.044
Now, I'm finally proving you all
so wrong.

01:03:07.087 --> 01:03:09.655
I'm finally making a name
for myself.

01:03:09.698 --> 01:03:11.570
And people are appreciating me.

01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:14.007
Auna, I can't do this, okay?

01:03:14.051 --> 01:03:15.835
My show is tomorrow, my job is...

01:03:15.879 --> 01:03:17.619
What about my audition?

01:03:17.663 --> 01:03:19.012
Wake up, Auna.

01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:21.754
Nothing is gonna come
from that audition.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.800
There are literally thousands
of other people

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:25.323
trying to do
the exact same thing,

01:03:25.366 --> 01:03:27.325
and with a lot more talent.

01:03:27.368 --> 01:03:30.197
You can't do this, Auna.
You never could.

01:03:30.241 --> 01:03:32.809
Just give it up.

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.082
Auna...

01:03:50.957 --> 01:03:52.306
I'll let you pack.

01:03:52.785 --> 01:03:54.047
Auna, please.

01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:56.310
Good luck tomorrow.

01:05:49.597 --> 01:05:51.730
I've reached the end.

01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:59.477
The peasant hangs himself.

01:06:19.366 --> 01:06:21.281
No, don't.

01:06:35.295 --> 01:06:38.603
This is... This is live.

01:07:33.136 --> 01:07:34.224
I'd like...

01:07:35.268 --> 01:07:36.487
I'd like that.

01:07:48.629 --> 01:07:49.630
He's right behind...

01:07:49.891 --> 01:07:51.415
He's in the room with you.

01:07:59.031 --> 01:08:00.032
No.

01:08:00.424 --> 01:08:01.425
No.

01:08:02.295 --> 01:08:03.296
No.

01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:07.996
No, please stop.

01:08:13.045 --> 01:08:14.612
- I need this.
- No. What are you doing?

01:08:14.655 --> 01:08:16.091
- That's mine.
- Someone is trying

01:08:16.135 --> 01:08:17.615
to commit suicide.

01:08:21.358 --> 01:08:23.751
She just took my charger
and said someone was trying

01:08:23.795 --> 01:08:25.274
- to commit suicide.
- She said what?

01:08:57.307 --> 01:08:59.265
No!

01:09:00.745 --> 01:09:02.877
So we're gonna need some
administration down here

01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:04.140
in the computer lab.

01:09:04.183 --> 01:09:05.863
We have a serious situation
with a student.

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:29.729
Hey. Wait. Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:09:47.835 --> 01:09:48.966
Hey.

01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:52.274
Stop.

01:10:35.796 --> 01:10:37.929
Auna? Five minutes.

01:10:39.104 --> 01:10:40.105
God.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.732
Hush. Mary walks.

01:11:00.212 --> 01:11:02.214
The smell of the moon
follows her.

01:11:02.432 --> 01:11:04.216
But her eyes follow my cousin.

01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:07.654
Would she kiss
a poor fishmonger?

01:11:08.655 --> 01:11:11.267
Would she wrap her arms
around the stench?

01:11:24.105 --> 01:11:26.282
Next up, Auna Rue.

01:11:30.111 --> 01:11:31.112
Auna...

01:11:33.114 --> 01:11:34.899
you can go now.

01:11:40.905 --> 01:11:43.995
Hey, hey, where is she?

01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:47.215
Where is she?

01:11:49.348 --> 01:11:51.350
Do... Get out there.

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:54.397
Auna.

01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:57.574
Auna, go.

01:12:10.543 --> 01:12:12.066
Auna.

01:12:16.244 --> 01:12:17.333
Auna.

01:12:39.529 --> 01:12:42.836
Auna, that was incredible.

01:12:43.402 --> 01:12:46.449
- That was incredible.
- Thank you, Mr. Schlake

01:12:46.492 --> 01:12:48.102
for everything.

01:12:48.538 --> 01:12:50.366
I knew you were a star.

01:12:51.889 --> 01:12:54.500
The right person
to set the scene.

01:12:58.852 --> 01:12:59.853
Auna?

01:13:00.637 --> 01:13:01.638
Yes.

01:13:03.074 --> 01:13:05.119
Scott Lamont,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:08.340
Oh, um, believe me,
the pleasure is all mine.

01:13:09.646 --> 01:13:12.562
Listen, can we... Can we chat
privately for a moment?

01:13:12.605 --> 01:13:14.128
Oh, of course.

01:13:25.488 --> 01:13:26.706
Auna, this scholarship

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.621
is something
you really want, isn't it?

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:34.192
I... Yes, um, being, uh, a great
actress is my dream.

01:13:34.235 --> 01:13:35.411
Good.

01:13:35.759 --> 01:13:36.890
I got to tell you,

01:13:37.195 --> 01:13:39.502
your monologue
was out of this world.

01:13:40.024 --> 01:13:42.064
I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like it.

01:13:43.462 --> 01:13:45.899
How would you like to attend
the NYU next year

01:13:45.943 --> 01:13:47.466
on a full scholarship?

01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:52.776
Um, I'd love to.

01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:55.431
- I would love to.
- Great.

01:13:56.693 --> 01:13:57.781
Great.

01:13:58.216 --> 01:13:59.347
Oh, you know what?

01:14:00.784 --> 01:14:03.047
Uh, I'm just curious,
what's that monologue from?

01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:04.657
I don't recognize it.

01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:10.446
It's called The Gallows.

01:14:12.926 --> 01:14:16.321
Oh, The Gallows, that's the one
the kids are doing, right?

01:14:16.364 --> 01:14:17.801
Because it's haunted?

01:14:17.844 --> 01:14:21.413
This Charlie kid, he, uh, um,
he hangs himself.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:23.459
"Oh, now the show is cursed."

01:14:24.155 --> 01:14:26.200
Some nonsense.

01:14:26.244 --> 01:14:29.203
These superstitions,
this, uh, Macbeth,

01:14:29.247 --> 01:14:33.425
break a leg, Charlie, Charlie
is all a bunch of poppycock.

01:14:39.953 --> 01:14:41.259
Auna?

01:14:44.175 --> 01:14:45.959
Are you...

01:14:46.003 --> 01:14:47.526
Well, we'll be
in contact with you

01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:49.833
and, uh, Mr. Schlake.

01:14:51.443 --> 01:14:54.272
So, um, great.

01:15:06.806 --> 01:15:11.811
Hey, it's me.
Um, I just wanted to say, um,

01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:15.511
I hope you have a great
audition tonight and, um...

01:15:17.861 --> 01:15:19.253
And I'm sorry.

01:15:20.254 --> 01:15:22.169
About the things I said.

01:15:25.216 --> 01:15:27.044
You're talented, Auna.

01:15:29.002 --> 01:15:30.351
You deserve better.

01:15:32.745 --> 01:15:35.487
Call me back and, um,
let me know how it went.

01:15:37.924 --> 01:15:39.535
I love you. Bye.

01:17:59.762 --> 01:18:00.980
What do you want?

01:19:17.665 --> 01:19:23.802
Hey, it's me.
Um, I just wanted to say, um,

01:19:24.368 --> 01:19:27.719
I hope you have a great
audition tonight and, um...

01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:32.158
And I'm sorry.

01:19:33.507 --> 01:19:35.901
About the things I said.

01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:40.166
You're talented, Auna.

01:19:43.256 --> 01:19:45.171
You deserve better.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.786
Call me back and, um,
let me know how it went.

01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:57.227
I love you. Bye.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.361
Mom?

01:20:34.917 --> 01:20:36.396
Charlie Grimille?

01:20:39.791 --> 01:20:41.793
You shouldn't say that name.

01:20:43.316 --> 01:20:45.449
Blake! Blake?

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:47.930
I need you back here.

01:20:47.973 --> 01:20:50.236
Hey, wait there! Hey!

01:22:24.243 --> 01:22:25.244
Cade?

01:22:25.897 --> 01:22:28.508
Auna. Hey.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.163
Hey.

01:22:32.208 --> 01:22:33.774
It's good to hear your voice.

01:22:38.562 --> 01:22:39.563
Listen.

01:22:40.912 --> 01:22:42.087
I'm sorry.

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:47.092
I am so sorry about Lisa and...

01:22:49.051 --> 01:22:50.400
I guess I just...

01:22:51.357 --> 01:22:53.446
I didn't understand
everything that was happening.

01:22:54.882 --> 01:22:57.973
Cade, I'm so lost.

01:23:01.541 --> 01:23:04.631
I don't know what to do.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.769
It's really good
to hear your voice.

01:23:15.816 --> 01:23:17.993
I've been doing more
research on this play.

01:23:18.906 --> 01:23:19.995
Auna.

01:23:21.474 --> 01:23:23.354
I think I found someone
who can end all of this.

01:24:16.964 --> 01:24:19.489
Hey.
What are you two doing in here?

01:24:19.532 --> 01:24:21.143
Did you check in
at the front desk?

01:24:21.186 --> 01:24:23.188
Uh, nobody
was at the front desk.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.452
We came to visit her, uh...

01:24:26.844 --> 01:24:31.631
we're her cousins.
From Independence.

01:24:33.198 --> 01:24:35.070
She hasn't seen us
in a long time.

01:24:37.159 --> 01:24:38.551
Whatever.

01:24:38.595 --> 01:24:42.816
Front desk. Never anybody
at the front desk.

01:24:43.252 --> 01:24:44.775
Story of my life.

01:24:50.346 --> 01:24:51.782
You got five minutes.

01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:53.871
Don't do anything stupid.

01:24:55.612 --> 01:24:57.483
I'll check in at the front desk.

01:25:23.596 --> 01:25:25.250
I didn't know what it was.

01:25:27.209 --> 01:25:30.081
Uh, I didn't understand.
I thought it was a stupid game.

01:25:32.257 --> 01:25:33.954
The Charlie Challenge.

01:25:37.697 --> 01:25:39.264
You should be careful.

01:25:40.744 --> 01:25:42.267
Using his name.

01:25:42.789 --> 01:25:43.964
Why?

01:25:45.009 --> 01:25:47.664
Why do you say anybody's name?

01:25:52.582 --> 01:25:53.844
To call upon them.

01:25:58.805 --> 01:26:01.939
That's why you need
to be careful.

01:26:05.508 --> 01:26:07.292
You really don't know.

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:08.902
Do you?

01:26:14.343 --> 01:26:17.694
My sister is dead.

01:26:22.655 --> 01:26:24.353
I need help.

01:26:28.618 --> 01:26:32.448
The key is sacrifice.

01:26:33.144 --> 01:26:34.537
What kind of sacrifice?

01:26:34.928 --> 01:26:36.626
The willing kind.

01:26:38.584 --> 01:26:40.325
I did the show for my father.

01:26:41.326 --> 01:26:44.286
To make those
that did this to him pay.

01:26:45.112 --> 01:26:46.375
Reese...

01:26:46.418 --> 01:26:50.422
He willingly
gave his life for me.

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:52.511
It was beautiful.

01:26:52.555 --> 01:26:53.991
What are you talking about?

01:26:55.775 --> 01:26:58.778
Just tell me what to do
to make it stop.

01:27:00.606 --> 01:27:02.565
It won't stop.

01:27:04.741 --> 01:27:06.090
The killings?

01:27:06.525 --> 01:27:08.440
They'll never stop.

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:12.575
Until a willing sacrifice
is made.

01:27:20.539 --> 01:27:21.801
He wants you!

01:27:21.845 --> 01:27:23.020
He's coming for you!

01:27:23.063 --> 01:27:24.674
- Nurse.
- He wants you!

01:27:24.717 --> 01:27:26.763
- Wait, wait, stop, stop.
- He's coming for you!

01:27:26.806 --> 01:27:28.460
Let go. Let go of me.

01:27:28.504 --> 01:27:30.462
Don't fucking touch me.

01:27:36.338 --> 01:27:38.165
Hey, are you okay?

01:27:38.905 --> 01:27:40.733
Auna? Hey.

01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:44.824
You okay?

01:27:44.868 --> 01:27:46.130
Yeah.

01:27:47.349 --> 01:27:49.568
Oh, I won't let anything
like that happen to you.

01:28:08.674 --> 01:28:09.849
What are you doing?

01:28:14.463 --> 01:28:15.812
It doesn't matter.

01:28:17.727 --> 01:28:18.728
Just...

01:28:20.512 --> 01:28:22.993
I wish I had realized
that sooner.

01:28:43.666 --> 01:28:44.884
Auna!

01:28:45.407 --> 01:28:46.712
Cade!

01:29:21.704 --> 01:29:23.401
Help! Help!

01:29:23.445 --> 01:29:25.403
Auna! No!

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.541
Cade!

01:29:42.638 --> 01:29:44.596
Help!

01:30:09.795 --> 01:30:11.797
Let go of me.

01:30:12.798 --> 01:30:14.496
Let go.

01:30:14.539 --> 01:30:15.584
Don't hurt her.

01:30:20.284 --> 01:30:21.372
Stop your struggling.

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:23.026
Cade? Cade!

01:30:23.069 --> 01:30:26.856
- Auna, are you okay?
- Cade! Cade!

01:30:26.899 --> 01:30:29.554
- Stop.
- Let go.

01:30:51.358 --> 01:30:52.708
You're "almostfamous."

01:30:52.751 --> 01:30:53.752
Auna.

01:30:55.188 --> 01:30:56.470
It's the one who sent me
the Charlie Challenge video.

01:30:56.494 --> 01:30:58.365
The one who's been messaging me,
watching me.

01:30:58.409 --> 01:30:59.802
Stop!

01:31:01.978 --> 01:31:03.806
It must be one of you.

01:31:03.849 --> 01:31:05.721
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:31:05.764 --> 01:31:07.200
You're insane.

01:31:07.244 --> 01:31:08.288
Cade.

01:31:08.332 --> 01:31:09.551
Get us out of this.

01:31:09.594 --> 01:31:10.595
It's the sacrifice.

01:31:11.814 --> 01:31:14.512
- A willing sacrifice.
- No. Auna, please.

01:31:14.947 --> 01:31:18.168
This? Don't even talk like that.

01:31:18.429 --> 01:31:20.344
One of you must be willing.

01:31:20.736 --> 01:31:21.998
That is what he wants.

01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:23.260
Who is he?

01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:33.009
One of you must be willing.

01:31:35.446 --> 01:31:37.404
That's what he wants.

01:31:38.841 --> 01:31:40.582
- Take me.
- No, Cade.

01:31:40.625 --> 01:31:42.322
- Auna, stop.
- No! It's my fault!

01:31:42.366 --> 01:31:43.498
Stop.

01:31:46.936 --> 01:31:47.980
I love you.

01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:50.722
No!

01:31:51.854 --> 01:31:52.855
No!

01:31:55.727 --> 01:31:56.989
Stop!

01:31:57.381 --> 01:32:00.340
It's my fault.
Please, don't do this to him.

01:32:00.384 --> 01:32:01.994
It's my fault.

01:32:02.038 --> 01:32:03.605
Let him live.

01:32:04.127 --> 01:32:05.476
Take me.

01:32:12.875 --> 01:32:14.485
Let him live.

01:32:15.486 --> 01:32:17.227
Take me.

01:32:25.148 --> 01:32:26.410
Auna.

01:32:39.075 --> 01:32:40.729
Why don't we stop there now?

01:32:40.772 --> 01:32:43.122
- Right, Lisa?
- You can't do this, Auna.

01:32:43.166 --> 01:32:44.384
You never could.

01:32:44.428 --> 01:32:46.125
- Give it up.
- Mom! Dad!

01:32:46.169 --> 01:32:47.213
Wait. Read this.

01:32:57.049 --> 01:33:00.183
Remember, your greatness...

01:33:00.923 --> 01:33:03.403
shines from within.

01:33:06.972 --> 01:33:10.846
Today, I live for me.

01:33:12.282 --> 01:33:16.199
And today, I can die for him.

01:35:08.006 --> 01:35:10.182
We did it, we did it.

01:35:31.595 --> 01:35:34.903
This is "almostfamous99."

01:35:36.034 --> 01:35:40.822
And I hope you enjoyed
a perfect Charlie Challenge.
