WEBVTT

00:09.708 --> 00:12.791
And one thing led to another,

00:12.875 --> 00:14.958
and now I'm gonna have to find
a new pool boy.

00:15.041 --> 00:18.083
You hooked up with the guy
who cleans your drains?

00:18.166 --> 00:21.666
Let's just say Rodrigo
did a very thorough job.

00:21.750 --> 00:25.125
-Shame I'm dumping him for his cousin.

00:25.208 --> 00:27.291
Oh hey, now that he's available,

00:27.375 --> 00:29.875
he can be your plus-one
to my next book signing.

00:29.958 --> 00:32.958
Why would I wanna date
your hand-me-down boy toy?

00:33.041 --> 00:36.625
I don't wanna sound elitist,
but he's covered in vegetable oil.

00:36.708 --> 00:40.416
You haven't had a serious boyfriend
since college, and it's worrying.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.833
I'm single by choice,

00:41.916 --> 00:46.875
because I have a fulfilling career
where I am doing really important things.

00:46.958 --> 00:49.875
In conclusion,
by duct-taping a bunch of drones together,

00:49.958 --> 00:53.166
you get the Drone Throne!

00:53.250 --> 00:54.958
God bless America!

00:58.583 --> 00:59.750
Great news, everyone!

00:59.833 --> 01:02.708
We've officially purchased
the dating app RightSwipe.

01:02.791 --> 01:05.833
We now have a blackmailer's ransom
in personal data.

01:05.916 --> 01:07.250
Oh my God,

01:07.333 --> 01:09.541
it's every profile in DC.

01:09.625 --> 01:10.750
Including Myc's?

01:10.833 --> 01:13.000
Huh, "Mold diggers swipe left."

01:13.083 --> 01:15.625
Andre identifies as alwayssexual?

01:15.708 --> 01:18.625
Surprise, surprise,
it says Gigi's attracted to power.

01:18.708 --> 01:20.791
Power is attracted to me, honey.

01:20.875 --> 01:23.791
With all this user data,
we finally have enough dick pics

01:23.875 --> 01:25.916
to blackmail the two remaining branches
of government…

01:26.000 --> 01:26.833
Ugh!

01:26.916 --> 01:29.375
…we don't control.
Reagan, I want you working late

01:29.458 --> 01:30.875
sorting through these dicks.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.250
Yes, sir.

01:32.333 --> 01:35.166
Three-to-one odds
it's the first dick she's seen in months.

01:35.250 --> 01:38.000
-Oh, I'll take that action.
-Oh, hell yeah, that's easy money.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.125
-What the hell? What is that?

01:40.208 --> 01:42.125
Are you betting on my dating life?

01:42.208 --> 01:44.333
More like winning on your dating life.

01:44.416 --> 01:47.250
-Four-to-one she dies alone.
-Sorry, Reagan, nothing personal.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.791
Well, we're gambling
on when you'll finally get a boyfriend…

01:49.875 --> 01:52.166
…so I guess
it's incredibly personal.

01:52.250 --> 01:55.916
Ugh, why is everyone
so obsessed with me getting a boyfriend?

01:56.958 --> 01:58.000
When she said "boyfriend,"

01:58.083 --> 02:00.625
she was picturing the older brother
from Boy Meets World.

02:00.708 --> 02:01.791
That's how long it's been.

02:01.875 --> 02:05.875
I can't imagine you with a guy.
Don't you reproduce by cell division?

02:05.958 --> 02:09.041
Fine. How about this for a bet?
I'm changing this week's mission.

02:09.125 --> 02:12.750
Double or nothing,
I'll have a boyfriend by next week.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.291
Then maybe you idiots
will stop gossiping about me

02:15.375 --> 02:16.791
and focus on work for once.

02:18.333 --> 02:19.916
-There. See?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.125
-DC, prepare to date Reagan Ridley.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Subtle.

02:51.291 --> 02:54.125
Fine, J.R.,
I'll vote to loosen regulations again.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.916
Just keep those pictures private.
I'm a Republican.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.208
I have no shame
except for the deep-rooted sexual kind.

03:00.291 --> 03:01.666
So, first date.

03:01.750 --> 03:03.833
Is it sweaty in here, or is it just me?

03:04.416 --> 03:06.125
Oh, this is just some work stuff.

03:06.208 --> 03:08.208
-My job is a secret. Secret stuff.
-Uh…

03:08.291 --> 03:10.916
And, uh, if I told you, you'd have to die.

03:13.916 --> 03:16.916
I'm so glad we matched.
Honestly, I--

03:17.000 --> 03:18.458
What are you doing?

03:18.541 --> 03:20.708
-Just a quick DNA scan.

03:20.791 --> 03:23.791
Great, you're a good genetic match.
Now, where were we?

03:23.875 --> 03:26.291
-I was just leaving.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.791
Jason Bourne
is about to be Bourne again.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.458
The Bourne Redundancy.

03:32.541 --> 03:35.166
It's more than you Bourgained for.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.166
Bourne, Bourne, Bourne.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.500
Bourne, Bourne, Bourne. Bourne. Bourne.

03:38.583 --> 03:40.375
Bourne!

03:40.458 --> 03:42.708
This movie is so unrealistic.

03:42.791 --> 03:47.375
Everybody knows that the shadow government
killed the real Jason Bourne years ago.

03:47.458 --> 03:49.166
Huh? The shadow government?

03:49.250 --> 03:50.083
Oh shit.

03:50.166 --> 03:52.000
We're gonna need an extraction team.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.000
-Hey, line up!
-Put me down for 5 Gs!

03:59.083 --> 04:00.333
What are you betting on now?

04:00.416 --> 04:02.958
It turns out RightSwipe
keeps an attractiveness score

04:03.041 --> 04:04.041
for every user.

04:04.125 --> 04:05.291
Brett's a perfect ten.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.416
It's an honor just to be objectified.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.208
What am I? Wait, don't tell me.

04:09.291 --> 04:12.583
Subtract a point for being divorced,
add one for being a veteran.

04:12.666 --> 04:14.333
Then there's the face.

04:14.416 --> 04:16.416
But I got a lot of baseball cards, so…

04:16.500 --> 04:18.666
-A goddamn zero?

04:19.750 --> 04:22.833
How's that even possible?
It's on a one-to-ten scale!

04:22.916 --> 04:25.625
Those numbers don't mean anything.
It's about what's in your heart.

04:25.708 --> 04:26.875
Says you, Hemsworth.

04:26.958 --> 04:30.000
If I could coast on my looks like you,
I'd be on easy street.

04:30.083 --> 04:33.583
Gigi, you don't think people just like me
for my looks, do you? I mean…

04:33.666 --> 04:37.541
Sweetie, don't frown.
It ruins the part of you that people like.

04:37.625 --> 04:41.583
Ever since I merged my DNA with a dolphin,
my life has been shit!

04:41.666 --> 04:44.083
When I try to unlock my phone
with my face,

04:44.166 --> 04:45.750
it sends out an Amber Alert.

04:45.833 --> 04:48.625
I bet if you had to live
a week with this mug,

04:48.708 --> 04:51.083
you'd be begging me to switch back.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.666
We'll take that action!

04:54.708 --> 04:55.750
I don't get it.

04:55.833 --> 04:58.916
I've been rejected
by almost every man in DC.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.416
I can't give my coworkers the satisfaction

05:01.500 --> 05:03.750
of watching me fail out of the gene pool.

05:03.833 --> 05:06.416
Typical humans, worried about gene pools.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.833
I have the ability to simulate worlds,

05:08.916 --> 05:11.125
and you're trying to make me
the Monica to your Rachel.

05:11.208 --> 05:12.708
Binging Friends, are we?

05:12.791 --> 05:14.125
No. Maybe.

05:14.208 --> 05:16.708
They have winning chemistry.
I'm not made of stone.

05:16.791 --> 05:19.458
You know,
I have all of RightSwipe's user data.

05:19.541 --> 05:23.458
Between the two of us, we could build
the perfect dating algorithm.

05:23.541 --> 05:26.500
I have a literal galaxy brain.
This task is beneath me.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.416
Your own legs aren't even beneath you.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.500
Please. If you help me,
I'll let you watch the second season.

05:31.583 --> 05:34.375
You mean I could find out
if Chandler finally gets that end table?

05:34.458 --> 05:35.833
Well-played, Reagan.

05:35.916 --> 05:38.291
A tasty little quid pro quo.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.250
Y'all are swapping faces.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.666
First man to ask
for their face back loses.

05:42.750 --> 05:44.250
-Any questions?
-Are you kidding?

05:44.333 --> 05:45.791
Just get this face off of me!

05:45.875 --> 05:47.625
Yes, Face/Off!

05:47.708 --> 05:50.041
That's my favorite movie
where faces come off.

05:50.125 --> 05:52.416
This is gonna take a lot of anesthetic.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.875
All right, let's do some John Woo shit.

06:24.916 --> 06:28.541
Oh, wow. I have got to stop basing
my surgeries on movies.

06:28.625 --> 06:31.833
Let's just swap your brains.
Freaky Friday, baby!

06:37.583 --> 06:38.416
I did it.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.083
It almost destroyed me,
but I found you a match.

06:41.166 --> 06:43.041
I'll try not to take that personally.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.416
-Bryan Jacobsen, 32.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.958
He lives in DC, teaches programming
to underprivileged children,

06:49.041 --> 06:50.375
and never had a female roommate,

06:50.458 --> 06:52.666
so he'll have nothing
to compare your house to.

06:52.750 --> 06:55.416
And he doesn't mind
wildly ambitious women?

06:55.500 --> 06:59.291
He's your perfect match.
He's turned on by being talked over.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.375
Hmm. What should I message him?
I need an opening line.

07:02.458 --> 07:05.250
Enter the Reagan Dome! No, not that.

07:07.166 --> 07:08.833
Oh my God,
he already messaged me!

07:08.916 --> 07:10.833
He wants to go on a date.
What should I say?

07:10.916 --> 07:15.541
Say yes. You're a 99.999% match.
Even you can't screw this up.

07:15.625 --> 07:18.333
I don't know. The last boyfriend
I could see a future with

07:18.416 --> 07:21.541
said that he'd love me
for as long as Pluto was a planet.

07:21.625 --> 07:23.625
I'm pretty sure he knew what was coming.

07:23.708 --> 07:25.416
I need this date to go perfectly.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.500
If only I could go
on a practice date so I'm ready.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.708
Well,
you're not practicing on me.

07:30.791 --> 07:34.083
-Practice my date on a robot.
-No, that's not what I meant.

07:34.166 --> 07:37.166
Practice on a robot. Heard you say it.
I'm already committed to it.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.375
Are you trying to torture me?

07:43.458 --> 07:45.916
Hey, Bryan. I'm Reagan.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.041
-Oh my God. Am I dead?
-No.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.666
Is this hell? Are you the devil?

07:50.750 --> 07:52.750
-The devil is a woman in a scrunchie!
-Uh…

07:52.833 --> 07:54.083
-Hold on.

07:54.166 --> 07:55.875
Okay, let's try that again.

07:56.916 --> 08:00.333
Awareness down, reactivity down,

08:00.416 --> 08:01.458
hair down.

08:02.458 --> 08:05.166
Oh, hey.
We've got to stop meeting like this.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.125
Not too bad for a night's work.

08:07.208 --> 08:09.041
I think he's ready for a test date.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.375
Or you could just go on a date
with the real Bryan.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.583
But what do I know?

08:12.666 --> 08:16.125
I'm only a Wi-Fi connection away
from being an actual god.

08:16.208 --> 08:18.666
Bryan-bot, you wanna get some dinner?

08:18.750 --> 08:22.291
Sure. I can't process food,
but I can mash it in my face hole.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.375
Well, that was pretty painless, for me.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.291
-Glenn, are you crying?

08:27.375 --> 08:30.875
I'm beautiful.
Fox News anchor beautiful.

08:30.958 --> 08:34.041
And I'm about to prove
that ugly is the new hot.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.333
Question. Is my blowhole supposed to hurt?

08:36.416 --> 08:38.666
Yeah, it's a fucking hole in your head.

08:38.750 --> 08:41.958
Give me your phone.
I got ten years of Tinder to catch up on.

08:47.000 --> 08:47.958
Nice.

08:48.041 --> 08:51.208
-This restaurant is perfect.

08:51.291 --> 08:53.333
It's my favorite, I think.

08:53.416 --> 08:55.916
Wait, are my memories just implanted lies?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.291
-Oh shit. The real Bryan.

08:59.375 --> 09:02.250
He can't see me
while I'm beta-dating his robo-double.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.458
We need to leave.

09:03.541 --> 09:06.000
Why is romance so complicated?

09:10.541 --> 09:11.458
Reagan?

09:11.541 --> 09:12.500
Reagan?

09:12.583 --> 09:15.250
Sorry,
I just working in the back,

09:15.333 --> 09:17.958
being super Italian.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.416
Sbarro! Mario Kart!

09:21.500 --> 09:23.125
Well, I'll be seeing you.

09:25.625 --> 09:27.625
Hey, Reagan.
Everything go okay in there?

09:27.708 --> 09:30.666
I missed my only shot
with my one true match,

09:30.750 --> 09:33.666
and I'm expecting
at least a written warning

09:33.750 --> 09:36.125
from the Italian Anti-Defamation League.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.750
God, maybe everybody's right.

09:37.833 --> 09:41.083
I'm gonna go home
and shop for a casket online.

09:41.166 --> 09:43.000
What if you didn't have to?

09:43.083 --> 09:46.500
Listen, I had a great time with you.
I've never had so much fun

09:46.583 --> 09:49.083
in the entire four hours and 38 minutes
I've been alive.

09:49.166 --> 09:51.500
I might not be the real thing,

09:51.583 --> 09:52.958
but at least I'm something.

09:53.041 --> 09:54.333
You mean, me and…

09:54.833 --> 09:56.666
Oh.

09:56.750 --> 09:59.666
Dating my own robot? That is…

10:00.166 --> 10:02.041
-Wow.

10:06.708 --> 10:08.041
Wanna go back to my place?

10:08.125 --> 10:10.916
We could forget about this date
and just chill.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.083
I would love that.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.750
Sorry, sir, you can't shop here.

10:17.833 --> 10:20.125
Excuse me?
I'm trying to get back out there,

10:20.208 --> 10:23.333
and I need new clothes
due to an extremely impractical surgery.

10:23.416 --> 10:25.041
Uh, no, you misunderstand.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.333
You're far too attractive to shop here.

10:27.416 --> 10:29.375
We do, however, need a model.

10:29.458 --> 10:32.541
Really? I've only ever been
photoshopped out of pictures.

10:32.625 --> 10:35.250
Nadia, what do you think
of our friend here?

10:35.333 --> 10:38.375
He's got the cheekbones,
shoulders of a Greek god.

10:38.458 --> 10:41.125
-Perfect nipple-to-areola ratio.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.458
You're kidding.
You've never modeled before?

10:43.541 --> 10:46.166
I did appear on a poster
for a circus once.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.125
I hope this isn't unprofessional.

10:48.208 --> 10:51.333
Would you like to have sex with me
behind that mannequin?

10:51.416 --> 10:54.041
Hot dog! Could this day get any better?

10:54.125 --> 10:56.250
Sorry, folks, my Brink's truck got a flat.

10:56.333 --> 10:59.458
I'm not gonna be able to jack it up
unless I give away some of this money.

10:59.541 --> 11:01.500
Hey, you look like a man
who already has money

11:01.583 --> 11:03.375
but deserves more anyway.

11:04.916 --> 11:06.958
No, you're too beautiful to cry.

11:09.333 --> 11:13.208
Move over, yesterday.
Today's my new favorite day to be alive.

11:13.291 --> 11:16.083
I'll have
a nonfat, triple-foam tapiocchiato.

11:16.166 --> 11:18.000
-That'll be six bucks.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.416
Usually when I come in here,
I get it for free.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.125
I'm so sorry to bother you.
Do you think you could spot me?

11:23.208 --> 11:25.333
How could you say no to a smile like this?

11:25.416 --> 11:28.041
-A sex pervert!

11:28.791 --> 11:31.000
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

11:31.083 --> 11:34.583
-Mommy, I'm scared of the Animorph!

11:34.666 --> 11:37.625
I am not an Animorph!

11:37.708 --> 11:40.333
I am a human being.

11:40.833 --> 11:41.666
Sort of.

11:42.250 --> 11:45.541
Who's got two thumbs
and is about to win your bet?

11:45.625 --> 11:48.125
-Hey-o, bitches!
-Hey.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.708
Holy Christ, it's finally happening.
She's fucking a robot.

11:51.791 --> 11:54.916
Reagan, honey, you really think
one of your science experiments

11:55.000 --> 11:56.333
is boyfriend material?

11:56.416 --> 11:59.625
Gigi, I made him
out of literal boyfriend material.

11:59.708 --> 12:00.666
Isn't that right, babe?

12:00.750 --> 12:03.083
I'm programmed to agree with you,
so yes, babe.

12:03.166 --> 12:04.625
Good Lord, this is sad.

12:04.708 --> 12:07.791
While everyone else
is wasting their lives swiping,

12:07.875 --> 12:10.583
I created the perfect man
who will never disappoint me.

12:10.666 --> 12:12.375
He even has two settings.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.291
-Netflix and chill.

12:14.375 --> 12:15.958
-Let's watch Planet Earth.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.166
Let's watch Planet Earth on mute.

12:18.250 --> 12:21.208
Yikes. Fine, all right.
You clearly need this more than I do.

12:21.291 --> 12:22.458
Everyone hear that?

12:22.541 --> 12:24.583
-Reagan solved romance!

12:24.666 --> 12:27.291
-Ah!

12:27.375 --> 12:31.416
-Wanna go home and put on sweatpants?
-You understand me.

12:32.708 --> 12:35.750
She wants an open floor plan.
He wants a divorce.

12:35.833 --> 12:38.708
This is it, domestic bliss.

12:38.791 --> 12:41.875
People really are their best selves
when they don't have to try.

12:41.958 --> 12:44.541
I was thinking,
now that things are getting serious,

12:44.625 --> 12:46.333
I want you to meet my mother.

12:46.416 --> 12:48.291
That's funny.
In a way, you're kind of my--

12:48.375 --> 12:51.125
-Okay, too ambitious for a Saturday.

12:53.916 --> 12:55.625
Do you wanna order Postmates

12:55.708 --> 12:58.416
and scroll through Instagram Stories
of people we hate?

12:58.500 --> 12:59.625
More than anything.

13:03.291 --> 13:05.458
Brett Hand speaking. How may you help me?

13:05.541 --> 13:09.375
Oh my God, you were right, okay?
I have been laughed at, hunted for sport,

13:09.458 --> 13:11.375
and a cop told me
that I had to sleep outside

13:11.458 --> 13:13.458
'cause my apartment's
a hundred yards from a school.

13:13.541 --> 13:14.791
Say no more, kid.

13:14.875 --> 13:17.375
Honestly, I'm impressed
you're still alive.

13:17.458 --> 13:19.375
-So we can switch back early?
-Hell no.

13:19.458 --> 13:23.041
I'm hot and rich, and you're now
a registered sex offender with my face.

13:23.125 --> 13:25.375
-Do the math!
-Can this day get any worse?

13:25.458 --> 13:27.083
Oh, it can, and it will.

13:27.166 --> 13:29.500
You gotta go to my ex-wife's house.

13:29.583 --> 13:32.833
We have a deal. Once a month,
she gets to scream at me for an hour

13:32.916 --> 13:34.416
as part of our divorce settlement.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.541
It can get physical, though,
so I'd wear a cup.

13:38.041 --> 13:40.291
-No, no, no!

13:44.125 --> 13:47.958
Hey, four-eyes, who the hell are you,
and what are you doing in my living room?

13:48.041 --> 13:50.416
-Uh, I'm the new boyfriend.
-Since when?

13:50.500 --> 13:53.250
I don't know, dude, whenever.
Hey, can I have 20 bucks?

13:53.333 --> 13:56.625
Listen up, shitbird, I'm the one
who asks for money in this house.

13:56.708 --> 13:58.541
Dad, I see you've met Bryan-bot.

13:59.958 --> 14:01.625
He completes me.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.166
I visit Julian Assange for two days,

14:04.250 --> 14:07.333
and this whole place goes to hell.
I'm out of here.

14:07.416 --> 14:08.416
It's been two days?

14:08.500 --> 14:10.666
Oh God, I gotta get some work done.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.166
But I thought you were gonna do
my repairs today.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.583
Fine, I'll fire up the 3D printer.

14:17.375 --> 14:20.875
Looks like I need to hop back
to the office to get more printer juice.

14:20.958 --> 14:23.416
All right. I'll be here
explaining Bitcoin to people on Reddit.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.791
What's to explain? It's digital money.

14:25.875 --> 14:27.041
Yeah.

14:27.125 --> 14:28.291
"Digital money."

14:28.375 --> 14:30.250
It's a lifestyle, babe.

14:32.291 --> 14:34.166
Is this what my life is now?

14:34.250 --> 14:37.291
Marathoning epic fail videos
with Brian-bot?

14:37.375 --> 14:40.333
That's what happens when you're too afraid
to date a real human.

14:40.416 --> 14:43.416
No, I'm not afraid.
I'm a relationship pioneer.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.500
-I'm like the settlers.
-Yeah, you're settling all right.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.208
Play whatever mind games you want.
I'm not scared.

14:49.291 --> 14:51.375
I'll text the real Bryan right now.

14:53.916 --> 14:54.833
Very healthy.

14:54.916 --> 14:57.458
You know what?
There's a third season of Friends,

14:57.541 --> 14:59.708
and it answers
a lot of lingering questions.

14:59.791 --> 15:01.291
And you're never gonna get it!

15:01.375 --> 15:03.500
Release it to me now, temptress.

15:03.583 --> 15:06.625
I will tear this building down
brick by brick!

15:06.708 --> 15:07.958
Do you hear me?

15:09.666 --> 15:12.208
Thanks for being on time
for once… …Glenn.

15:12.291 --> 15:13.750
Why don't we get started?

15:13.833 --> 15:16.333
If I get one more phone call from school,

15:16.416 --> 15:20.375
saying you're forcing our daughter
to wear all camo so boys can't see her,

15:20.458 --> 15:21.458
I swear to God--

15:21.541 --> 15:22.958
No, you're right. I'm sorry.

15:23.041 --> 15:24.958
Don't you dare agree with--

15:25.041 --> 15:27.583
Wait, what did you say?
And what is wrong with your voice?

15:27.666 --> 15:29.250
That's the sound of an apology.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.333
Glenn, notice how
you hold space for Dolores

15:31.416 --> 15:33.375
without calling her
an antifa son of a bitch.

15:33.458 --> 15:36.458
-Something's off.
-No, it's just been a tough week.

15:36.541 --> 15:38.833
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm making this about me now.

15:38.916 --> 15:42.875
-I'm here to listen.
-Apologizing? Active listening?

15:42.958 --> 15:46.083
Glenn Dolphman,
you've got me all hot and bothered.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.875
Oh, no, no. Dolores, wait.

15:47.958 --> 15:49.375
I'm not the man you married.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.250
No, you are definitely not.

15:51.333 --> 15:54.666
-And that's a good thing.
-No, I… I'm telling you, I'm not Glenn.

15:54.750 --> 15:59.625
Yeah, and I'm not turned on
for the first time since Desert Storm.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.875
-No! No!

16:01.958 --> 16:03.375
This is progress.

16:04.541 --> 16:05.791
Bryan-bot?

16:05.875 --> 16:07.083
Hello?

16:09.208 --> 16:12.000
Okay, this is feeling ominous.

16:13.666 --> 16:14.833
What's going on?

16:14.916 --> 16:16.833
Oh,
look who decided to show up.

16:16.916 --> 16:20.000
Sorry. I got a little held up.

16:20.083 --> 16:21.833
Texting Bryan?

16:21.916 --> 16:25.416
I know. I hacked your laptop,
and I saw your messages.

16:25.500 --> 16:29.208
Well, if you can move on, so can I.

16:29.291 --> 16:32.291
You're dumping me for a robot of myself?

16:32.375 --> 16:36.375
-Wow, that is pitch-perfect irony.
-Definitely an upgrade.

16:36.458 --> 16:39.750
No offense, babe,
but you kind of let yourself go.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.208
I let myself go?

16:41.291 --> 16:43.791
You're a robot
who gave themselves diabetes.

16:43.875 --> 16:45.125
Prediabetes.

16:45.208 --> 16:48.583
And you're just jealous
because my hot new GF's a perfect ten.

16:48.666 --> 16:50.083
And I'll prove it.

16:50.166 --> 16:52.500
You can't turn its confidence
up that high.

16:52.583 --> 16:57.000
Do you have any idea how dangerous I'd be
if I had zero self-doubt?

17:01.291 --> 17:03.166
Hello, Reagan.

17:07.166 --> 17:09.375
Bryan, what have you…

17:09.875 --> 17:12.750
Bring me Bryan.

17:12.833 --> 17:15.208
Right here, babe-a-rino.

17:17.583 --> 17:18.958
The real Bryan.

17:20.416 --> 17:22.958
-Ba… ba… ba… ba… babe.

17:35.458 --> 17:38.333
You seriously thought
you could outsmart me?

17:38.416 --> 17:41.500
I'm ten times faster
and more confident than you.

17:41.583 --> 17:43.625
-And you have gum in your hair.

17:43.708 --> 17:46.791
Oh yeah?
Well, I built the guy that built you.

17:46.875 --> 17:50.250
Well, I downloaded your dissertation,
and I found several errors.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.666
No.
Just punctuation stuff though, right?

17:53.750 --> 17:56.333
I should get going.
I have a date with real Bryan.

17:56.416 --> 17:57.958
You got a date already?

17:58.041 --> 18:01.166
Yeah, it's called texting back, Einstein.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.125
Ever heard of it?

18:02.208 --> 18:04.583
You can't. You're unstable.
You could hurt him.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.250
What do you care? You were too afraid
to go out with him anyway.

18:07.333 --> 18:10.166
How's my outfit by the way?
Too sexy for a museum?

18:10.250 --> 18:14.125
We both know that museums
are the sexiest places on Earth.

18:14.208 --> 18:16.541
Great, I'll send you an invite
to the wedding

18:16.625 --> 18:17.500
or the funeral.

18:17.583 --> 18:19.291
We'll see how the first date goes.

18:23.833 --> 18:26.500
Oh God! I have to warn Bryan!

18:30.458 --> 18:32.541
Brett Hand. I'm here to rage.

18:32.625 --> 18:34.166
No, we're at capacity, mate.

18:34.250 --> 18:37.583
But I'm an LA ten and a DC 24!

18:37.666 --> 18:41.958
-Oi, this way, ladies.
-Wait, Nadia and Nadia's prude friend.

18:42.041 --> 18:43.333
It's me, Brett.

18:43.416 --> 18:46.875
I thought you guys moved to Alaska
to become ice road truckers.

18:47.583 --> 18:50.041
Yeah, we totally made that up
to avoid having sex with you.

18:50.125 --> 18:53.041
Whose idea of foreplay
is mansplaining the Civil War?

18:53.125 --> 18:54.916
It was about states' rights!

18:55.000 --> 18:57.666
Whatever, I don't need you anyway.
I'm on a billboard,

18:57.750 --> 19:00.000
and that's something
they can never take away.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.458
Oh come on.
What part of this isn't working for you?

19:04.541 --> 19:06.916
The hair? The abs? The butt?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.500
Goodbye, Brett.

19:13.041 --> 19:16.166
Okay, fruitcake,
why am I still repulsive to women?

19:16.250 --> 19:17.458
I want answers!

19:17.541 --> 19:18.416
Oh, hey, Glenn.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.541
Yeah, I really need
to talk to you about something.

19:20.625 --> 19:23.708
It's kind of a truth bomb.
You love bombs though, right?

19:27.958 --> 19:28.833
Holy shit.

19:28.916 --> 19:32.333
I'm sensing that Brett
sexually satisfied Glenn's wife.

19:32.416 --> 19:33.416
Oh my God.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.458
How did we give J.R.
nine-to-one odds on that?

19:37.291 --> 19:41.000
But don't you see? Your messy divorce,
it wasn't about your bad face.

19:41.083 --> 19:42.875
It was about your bad personality.

19:44.166 --> 19:46.500
I'll rephrase. You still have a shot,

19:46.583 --> 19:48.875
even looking like you or… or me.
Like this.

19:48.958 --> 19:51.166
Sorry, the grammar in this scenario
is really challenging.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.750
You really mean that?

19:52.833 --> 19:54.958
I do. Your wife just wants someone
who will listen--

19:55.041 --> 19:58.041
I got the broad base of it.
Let's fire up the Face/Off shit.

19:58.125 --> 20:00.250
This war hero's turning back into a zero.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.083
All right, who bet
this thing would have a tight moral?

20:06.083 --> 20:09.166
I'm surprised you reached out.
I kinda thought you ghosted me.

20:09.250 --> 20:12.875
I was
a different person then, literally.

20:12.958 --> 20:14.375
Oh!

20:14.458 --> 20:17.166
Uh, do you wanna check out
the rare minerals room? Oh!

20:17.250 --> 20:18.875
-Whoa!

20:18.958 --> 20:22.541
I'm checking out some rare minerals
right now, amber eyes.

20:22.625 --> 20:24.000
That bitch.

20:24.083 --> 20:27.625
Wow, you are very confident.

20:27.708 --> 20:29.541
Uh, I am going to find the bathroom.

20:29.625 --> 20:31.958
-Don't keep me waiting.
-Hmm.

20:32.958 --> 20:35.708
Ah! Oh my God!
Reagan, what are you doing in here?

20:35.791 --> 20:38.041
Listen, that person out there is not me.

20:38.125 --> 20:40.875
She is an impostor,
and she's insane and…

20:40.958 --> 20:44.208
Wow, those eyes. What was I saying?

20:44.291 --> 20:45.791
The crazy impostor girl?

20:45.875 --> 20:48.500
Oh my God,
was she the one at the Italian restaurant

20:48.583 --> 20:51.625
who covered herself in sauce
and started acting racist?

20:52.416 --> 20:54.250
Yes, that was her.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.541
Is she dangerous?
I left my pepper spray at home.

20:56.625 --> 20:58.291
Don't worry, just stay here.

21:05.375 --> 21:07.750
Reagan.
You didn't think I'd think you'd come?

21:07.833 --> 21:09.291
I am you, you know.

21:09.375 --> 21:12.250
You're unstable.
I have to decommission you, Robo-Reagan.

21:12.333 --> 21:13.916
Well, look who's talking.

21:16.125 --> 21:18.583
I'd rather be unstable than unfulfilled.

21:21.625 --> 21:25.333
Really? We both know
you got kicked off the softball team

21:25.416 --> 21:29.958
for having weak arms,
and I am a flawless machine.

21:31.041 --> 21:34.000
-With impractical shoes.

21:37.166 --> 21:39.500
Are we really fighting over a boy?

21:39.583 --> 21:42.083
We are failing the Bechdel Test right now.

21:42.166 --> 21:44.166
Oh, right.
Quick, talk about something else.

21:44.250 --> 21:45.958
This weather sure is good.

21:46.041 --> 21:48.125
Yeah, agreed. Okay, test passed.

21:48.833 --> 21:52.208
How about this? You take Bryan
Tuesdays and Thursdays from four to six,

21:52.291 --> 21:55.000
and I take Fridays and Saturdays
every other month.

21:55.083 --> 21:55.916
That would be…

21:56.000 --> 21:57.916
So efficient!

22:03.333 --> 22:05.291
-Ow!

22:05.375 --> 22:08.375
-Hey, is that from my stand mixer?

22:08.916 --> 22:11.333
It's not like you… …bake.

22:16.833 --> 22:18.375
Just give up.

22:18.458 --> 22:20.833
I've seen your living room.
I know you want to.

22:21.833 --> 22:23.875
I get it. You think I'm weak.

22:23.958 --> 22:25.500
And maybe you're right.

22:25.583 --> 22:28.583
But my weaknesses
are your weaknesses too,

22:29.250 --> 22:31.166
except for this one.

22:44.500 --> 22:48.125
I guess you were
the super-r-r-r-r-rior Reagan after all.

22:48.208 --> 22:50.208
Please, go to… …go to Bryan.

22:50.291 --> 22:52.166
I've taught you everything I could.

22:52.250 --> 22:56.208
You were trying to help me realize
my true potential the whole time?

22:56.291 --> 22:59.458
Sure, let's go with that.

23:00.666 --> 23:02.250
Oh my God. Did you just…

23:02.333 --> 23:04.833
Is she a robot version of you?

23:04.916 --> 23:08.000
Yeah, she's a version of me
that I'm trying to move past.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.416
Let's get out of here.

23:10.083 --> 23:14.250
And the fake you was made by fake me,

23:14.333 --> 23:15.291
which you made.

23:15.375 --> 23:16.416
More or less.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.625
Wow, so you're like
a badass genius scientist.

23:19.708 --> 23:21.333
Listen, I should have done this earlier,

23:21.416 --> 23:23.916
but do you wanna go out
on a date sometime?

23:24.500 --> 23:27.458
Yeah, but no. Right?

23:27.541 --> 23:29.375
You made a fat, dumb robot of me

23:29.458 --> 23:31.583
and then killed him
when he tried to break up with you.

23:31.666 --> 23:33.625
Sorry, Reagan,
that feels like a deal-breaker.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.041
You know what? It's okay.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.291
I can take a no.

23:40.041 --> 23:41.208
See ya, Bryan.

23:43.625 --> 23:46.125
Yeah, we're gonna need an extraction team.

23:50.250 --> 23:53.416
-Dolores, I'm here to listen.
-Good.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.500
Because last week,
when we made love, it was so tender…

23:56.583 --> 23:57.416
Mm-hmm.

23:57.500 --> 24:02.208
…yet raw. I did things with you
I swore I would never do, and I loved it.

24:02.291 --> 24:03.875
Dark, erotic things.

24:03.958 --> 24:07.000
It was
a great night for everyone,

24:07.083 --> 24:09.125
a great night for America.

24:09.208 --> 24:11.333
Oh, honey, your face.

24:11.416 --> 24:12.625
Yeah, I know!

24:12.708 --> 24:14.458
You love my beautiful face so much,

24:14.541 --> 24:17.333
you'll just sleep with anyone who has it!

24:19.250 --> 24:22.166
-And that's the last of it.
-What about Robo-Reagan?

24:22.250 --> 24:25.416
Weirdest thing. The extraction team said
they never found a body.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.333
You don't say.

24:26.416 --> 24:29.541
Speaking of killer robots,
why are you powered up at this hour?

24:29.625 --> 24:31.916
Well, I've been making
adjustments to the algorithm.

24:32.000 --> 24:32.833
The algorithm?

24:32.916 --> 24:35.875
There was only one match for me.
It's a waste of time.

24:35.958 --> 24:38.125
There was only one match, but you changed.

24:38.208 --> 24:40.000
And now, so has the algorithm.

24:40.083 --> 24:42.583
But it's been a long week, so…

24:42.666 --> 24:45.208
Hey, hey. Not so fast.
Who do you have on deck?

24:45.291 --> 24:47.791
There's Dylan.
He's a tough guy with a heart of gold.

24:47.875 --> 24:49.625
He wrote that explicitly in his bio.

24:49.708 --> 24:52.583
There's also DJ,
who likes to DJ, and BJ, who…

24:52.666 --> 24:55.041
-Well, you'll never believe this.
-Likes BJs?

24:55.125 --> 24:57.916
No. What?
He's a youth pastor who kicked heroin.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.041
There's also Marcus.

24:59.125 --> 25:01.583
Oh, Marcus isn't hard to look at.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.041
Neither is his NSA profile.

25:04.125 --> 25:07.458
Too late. I already texted him.
You can go back to binging Friends.

25:07.541 --> 25:09.208
-How you doin'?

25:10.500 --> 25:13.333
When I kill all humans,
you will be spared.

25:13.416 --> 25:17.416
Only you. Only Joey.
