WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:05.604
Okay, this has been
really fun, guys, but Phoebe

00:05.918 --> 00:08.879
actually brought us here tonight
to say something, didn't you, Pheebs?

00:09.218 --> 00:14.012
No, no, l... I just think that we don't get
to see enough of each other, that's all.

00:14.395 --> 00:17.435
Might be a little longer, too, seeing
as we're off to Paris in the morning.

00:18.276 --> 00:21.191
Yeah, about that French merger?

00:21.532 --> 00:24.607
Hong Kong, Rome, gay Paris.
It's enough to send

00:24.955 --> 00:27.916
- a girl's head spinning, know?
- But wasn't there something you really

00:28.212 --> 00:30.409
wanted to say about?

00:32.136 --> 00:34.448
You must have
great business karma.

00:34.725 --> 00:37.481
Oh, karma?
I don't believe in that stuff.

00:37.773 --> 00:39.766
- No, not at all?
- Well, I mean, you know,

00:40.027 --> 00:42.099
if somebody cuts me off on the road,

00:42.366 --> 00:44.836
I'd like to think that they're
gonna get what's coming to them.

00:45.120 --> 00:49.003
That's karma, the great cosmic justice
system. You reap what you sow.

00:49.337 --> 00:51.375
Great, fabulous. Anyway, Phoebe.

00:53.638 --> 00:56.439
Okay. All right.

00:57.853 --> 01:01.007
Jason, there is something
that I want to share

01:01.318 --> 01:02.673
with you right now.

01:02.905 --> 01:04.943
And that...

01:05.200 --> 01:07.000
...would be...

01:08.040 --> 01:09.873
...a toast.

01:11.087 --> 01:12.920
A toast to your new merger.

01:14.554 --> 01:17.389
Pheebs, could you help me?
With the cobbler?

01:22.401 --> 01:24.519
Am I missing something?

01:25.951 --> 01:27.864
Okay, that was a three-course meal,

01:28.121 --> 01:31.754
not including the fruit and cheese
plate. I gave you a million openings.

01:32.087 --> 01:33.601
What do you want, a drumroll?

01:33.882 --> 01:35.875
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

01:36.137 --> 01:38.209
You are going with him
to France tomorrow.

01:38.474 --> 01:41.310
You've put this off for too long.
You have to tell him you're a witch.

01:41.606 --> 01:43.200
I just think maybe
we should wait until

01:43.861 --> 01:45.341
we get there to tell him, you know?

01:45.572 --> 01:47.930
Then if there's an emergency,
you can orb us back, okay?

01:48.244 --> 01:51.045
You've probably been caught
almost like a million times.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.087
You can't keep taking that risk.

01:53.337 --> 01:54.931
I know.

01:55.799 --> 01:57.280
Maybe I should wait till tomorrow,

01:57.512 --> 02:00.234
until after the big banquet
so I don't upset his big day.

02:00.851 --> 02:03.414
I think that you have a big
problem with avoiding conflict,

02:03.691 --> 02:06.527
and one day, missy, it is gonna
come back and bite you in the ass.

02:07.198 --> 02:08.996
Hey, he's getting
a little antsy in there.

02:09.244 --> 02:11.601
And you, what is it
with this whole karma thing?

02:11.874 --> 02:13.992
You're supposed to be
making it easier for her.

02:16.426 --> 02:17.746
Piper needs your help fast.

02:17.968 --> 02:20.201
Saved by the orb, great.
Keep Jason occupied.

02:26.445 --> 02:28.084
Leo?

02:28.657 --> 02:30.091
What are you doing here?

02:30.369 --> 02:32.441
Just bringing dessert,
you want some?

02:32.707 --> 02:34.665
The girls are just tidying up.

02:38.386 --> 02:39.866
Crap.

02:42.768 --> 02:45.444
- Piper.
- About time.

02:48.529 --> 02:50.282
It wasn't easy to find you
in these catacombs.

02:50.533 --> 02:52.126
You were supposed to wait
so I could help.

02:52.370 --> 02:53.884
Well, I thought I could handle it.

02:54.123 --> 02:56.241
<i>Except I must have
missed something in the Book.</i>

02:56.545 --> 02:59.015
- I guess so.
- Look, every time I hit one,

02:59.300 --> 03:01.020
two more show up.

03:08.695 --> 03:10.574
Okay, back up.

03:11.116 --> 03:12.676
Hey, boys.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.356
Okay, new plan. Blast and then bail.

03:26.645 --> 03:28.205
Okay.

03:28.481 --> 03:31.362
Hey, Phoebe,
what's taking you so long?

03:31.655 --> 03:33.249
Where...? Where did they go?

03:33.493 --> 03:35.851
Must be an emergency
or something.

03:36.164 --> 03:39.000
It's always some emergency
or some phone call

03:39.337 --> 03:42.252
or some marathon pee break.
What's going on?

05:37.401 --> 05:39.964
I think I'd better go check on Wyatt.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.541
I've never seen him like that.
He looked at me

05:43.789 --> 05:44.985
like he had no idea who I was.

05:45.209 --> 05:48.284
He doesn't know you.
Not the witch you anyway.

05:48.839 --> 05:51.231
He's just gonna need some time.

05:51.511 --> 05:54.870
Why didn't I just tell him?
And no "I told you so's."

05:55.186 --> 05:57.224
We all make little mistakes, honey.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.959
This was a very big mistake.

05:59.194 --> 06:01.835
I can't imagine how he's feeling
right now, what he's going through.

06:02.116 --> 06:04.586
The good news is,
it's out in the open now

06:04.872 --> 06:07.184
and, you know, you guys
have no more secrets.

06:07.460 --> 06:10.694
Food's away, table's cleared.
There anything else I can do?

06:11.008 --> 06:12.887
No, thank you.

06:13.181 --> 06:15.777
Hey, I feel awful.
Sorry about what happened.

06:16.104 --> 06:17.458
It's not your fault.

06:18.065 --> 06:20.218
Well... Well, actually it is.

06:20.528 --> 06:23.044
Why? Did you shove Jason
into the kitchen?

06:23.326 --> 06:25.284
No, but my karma did.

06:26.623 --> 06:30.302
I'm serious. I'm convinced I'm carrying
the burden of my family's karma.

06:30.631 --> 06:33.193
I mean, we did so much bad
with magic.

06:33.471 --> 06:37.263
Now magic's doing bad to me.
And those I care about.

06:37.604 --> 06:40.360
Now, that is completely ridiculous.

06:41.110 --> 06:43.946
The feud has lasted
for decades in my family

06:44.283 --> 06:46.196
and so many people
were hurt in the crossfire.

06:46.454 --> 06:48.970
I mean, somebody's gotta
inherit that bad karma, right?

06:50.127 --> 06:51.801
That's not really how karma works.

06:52.089 --> 06:54.286
You live a double life
with your boyfriend,

06:54.595 --> 06:58.478
and you pay the price. If anyone's
karma made this happen, it's mine.

06:58.853 --> 07:02.053
That's true. You had the chance
to clean this up tonight, and you didn't.

07:02.401 --> 07:03.882
See, there's that
"I told you so," huh?

07:04.155 --> 07:06.034
Only to make a point.

07:06.326 --> 07:10.323
No, you're right. I've been
avoiding conflict my whole life.

07:10.711 --> 07:13.102
What, and it just happened
the night I was here? I mean,

07:13.382 --> 07:14.942
- that's all I'm saying.
- You guys,

07:15.177 --> 07:19.015
this mea culpa game is real fun and all,
but we're not gonna solve anything.

07:19.350 --> 07:21.662
Those multiplying swarm demons
on the other hand?

07:21.940 --> 07:23.374
Right, we riled them up, didn't we?

07:23.609 --> 07:26.251
And if they attack right now,
we won't know how to deal with them.

07:26.531 --> 07:30.528
<i>So why don't you two hit the Book
and I'll catch up after I check on Wyatt.</i>

07:30.874 --> 07:33.106
Would you guys mind
if I sat this one out?

07:33.379 --> 07:35.337
I kind of feel like
I need to go see Jason.

07:35.591 --> 07:39.713
- Well, maybe after we've...
- No, we can handle it.

07:41.770 --> 07:44.082
All right.

07:47.449 --> 07:49.043
Leo. No, no, no.

07:49.285 --> 07:50.799
What? What, what, what is it?

07:51.039 --> 07:52.439
This, this.

07:52.665 --> 07:53.860
What, my grandmother's quilt?

07:54.086 --> 07:58.368
Her red quilt, the colour of anger
and violence and all things bad.

07:58.761 --> 08:01.517
- Bad? I used that quilt.
- Well, you can have it back.

08:01.809 --> 08:05.965
Wyatt is now using
the powder-blue baby blanket.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.630
Did you turn off
the serenity Mozart CD?

08:12.038 --> 08:14.794
Look, we need to bathe Wyatt
in goodness,

08:15.086 --> 08:18.161
and nurture peace
and serenity, happy things.

08:18.801 --> 08:21.762
Piper, don't you think you're
overreacting a little bit?

08:22.099 --> 08:24.411
Leo, there is no such thing
as overreacting

08:24.687 --> 08:26.600
when it comes
to the future of our child.

08:26.859 --> 08:29.695
Okay, but aren't the swarm demons
the last on the list of threats?

08:30.030 --> 08:32.342
- Yes, but...
- Okay, and when they're gone,

08:32.620 --> 08:34.453
are you gonna stop
worrying a little bit?

08:34.707 --> 08:38.909
No, because I sent Chris to suss out
if there's any new threats.

08:39.258 --> 08:42.652
Okay, not to press a point,
but didn't you just have an epiphany

08:42.974 --> 08:45.285
about not focusing all
of your energy on Wyatt?

08:45.563 --> 08:47.760
Yes, well, that was before
Chris informed us

08:48.025 --> 08:50.986
that our child was gonna grow up
to be the future of all evil.

08:53.034 --> 08:58.272
Besides, it's not all I do.
I have the club, I have friends.

08:59.088 --> 09:00.283
Well...

09:01.301 --> 09:04.741
Look, it's just that
Wyatt still comes first.

09:05.058 --> 09:08.771
Which is why you are gonna
take him up to the Elders

09:09.107 --> 09:12.546
so he's safe while we figure out
how to deal with the swarm demons.

09:12.866 --> 09:14.859
While you're there,
ask them if there's anything

09:15.120 --> 09:17.078
they can do to ensure
goodness in Wyatt.

09:17.333 --> 09:20.328
- You know, pull a few strings?
- Piper, we don't need strings pulled,

09:20.630 --> 09:22.144
we can protect our son ourselves.

09:22.425 --> 09:25.101
Well, in the future,
apparently, we don't.

09:25.389 --> 09:28.589
Okay, so look, there are blue bootees
in the bag in case he gets cold.

09:28.897 --> 09:31.413
So don't be afraid
to use them, okay?

09:35.619 --> 09:39.013
Don't ask me, she's your mother.

09:41.504 --> 09:45.501
Look, you and I both know,
in order to make this work,

09:45.848 --> 09:49.002
- you can't repress yourself.
- I'm not. Look, practising magic.

09:49.311 --> 09:51.224
Yeah, but you don't want me to.

09:51.524 --> 09:54.087
Every relationship is gonna
have its challenges, right?

09:54.363 --> 09:57.438
- Look at Phoebe and Jason.
- I'm telling you, that was me.

09:57.787 --> 10:00.668
No, that was them not being
truthful with each other.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.522
And as long as we are,
we're gonna be fine.

10:04.550 --> 10:07.465
"Fine" would be if I could
start over with a clean slate.

10:07.765 --> 10:10.043
You just be the wonderful person
that you are,

10:10.312 --> 10:13.227
and it's gonna make up for all the
bad things that your family ever did.

10:13.651 --> 10:16.008
Not in this lifetime.
I want to start over.

10:16.323 --> 10:19.523
It's not possible.
If it were, everybody would do it.

10:19.871 --> 10:21.989
Okay, everybody's
not a powerful witch.

10:22.294 --> 10:25.255
Look, karma is the DNA
of the universe.

10:25.550 --> 10:28.066
It's what balances everything out.
You start screwing with that,

10:28.348 --> 10:31.229
you can mess up
the entire cosmic order of things.

10:32.481 --> 10:34.713
Maybe you can help me cast a spell.

10:35.027 --> 10:37.099
What part of "no shortcuts"
are you not getting?

10:37.532 --> 10:41.289
There's an aura cleanse, a chakra
cleanse, but no karma cleanse.

10:41.625 --> 10:44.938
If it were possible to be cleansed,
it'd be in there, but there's no spell.

10:45.256 --> 10:47.055
It can't be done.

10:47.718 --> 10:50.359
- Got anything?
- Yeah, let's see,

10:50.641 --> 10:53.795
they are distant relatives
of Quossis and vampires,

10:54.105 --> 10:55.665
which means
they come from a hive.

10:56.486 --> 10:58.045
Did you even read this?

10:58.280 --> 11:00.159
I skimmed it.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.287
So they were drones
that we were killing.

11:03.626 --> 11:06.507
Well, no wonder
they just kept coming back.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.436
It says we have to kill the king
to kill the hive,

11:09.720 --> 11:12.635
which requires the power-of-three
spell. I'll call Phoebe.

11:12.935 --> 11:15.691
Hey, just slow down
there, okay? Take it easy.

11:16.567 --> 11:21.362
Okay, you orb out and get Phoebe,
and I'll start on the potion.

11:21.784 --> 11:24.699
Why don't we just track
the leader down? You and I.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.722
That way, Phoebe and Jason can
have a little bit of time alone, yeah?

11:28.506 --> 11:32.469
Well, what if the swarm
attacks before...? Okay, fine.

11:32.807 --> 11:34.605
We'll locate the ruler first.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.614
Brilliant idea.

11:37.482 --> 11:40.079
Hey, can I orb you anywhere?

11:40.405 --> 11:43.127
No, it's okay. I drove my car here.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.127
Okay. I'll see you soon.

12:19.899 --> 12:21.698
- You stay away.
- We need to talk.

12:21.986 --> 12:24.024
No. No. I don't want to talk.

12:24.325 --> 12:25.805
You're... This is your...

12:26.996 --> 12:29.638
This... This is so beyond...

12:29.919 --> 12:32.880
This is so far beyond my reality.

12:33.215 --> 12:37.178
You know, l... I'm just still trying
to figure out how

12:37.516 --> 12:40.591
you could...
Fifteen months, I didn't know!

12:40.940 --> 12:42.853
I wanted to tell you.

12:43.110 --> 12:45.182
I really did, but I couldn't.

12:45.450 --> 12:47.727
And you know now,
so can we talk about this, please?

12:47.995 --> 12:49.715
Okay, fine, let's talk.

12:49.957 --> 12:54.318
All right, what...? What was this, huh?
The Godiva girls, was that magic?

12:54.675 --> 12:56.429
- Yeah.
- Man, still...

12:56.763 --> 13:00.395
Okay, what about that funny-Iooking
little cousin of yours, cousin Shamus,

13:00.729 --> 13:03.006
what the hell was he?
One of the seven dwarves?

13:03.276 --> 13:06.237
No, actually, he was a leprechaun.

13:06.532 --> 13:07.932
Not really my cousin.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.546
Look, Jason, I know how you feel.

13:12.836 --> 13:14.829
How do I feel, Phoebe?

13:15.675 --> 13:18.510
Tell me because...
Because I don't know.

13:18.807 --> 13:20.765
But you, you always seem to know.

13:21.018 --> 13:23.295
So tell me, how's it
gonna feel when I crash,

13:23.564 --> 13:25.522
because I see one coming.

13:25.820 --> 13:28.336
Is it gonna feel like
when you said, "I love you too"?

13:28.867 --> 13:31.429
Because that,
that was magic, wasn't it?

13:33.501 --> 13:34.936
But I do love you.

13:36.758 --> 13:40.391
I don't...
I don't have time for this.

13:41.308 --> 13:44.348
I didn't want you
to find out like this, believe me.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.705
I...

13:46.945 --> 13:50.577
I have to concentrate. I'm speaking
in front of 100 shareholders

13:50.910 --> 13:55.669
celebrating the second-biggest
French media merger of the decade.

13:56.045 --> 13:57.604
Okay?

13:57.840 --> 14:00.038
So...

14:00.303 --> 14:02.614
...I need to be in focus.

14:06.024 --> 14:07.458
You're the one that wanted to look

14:07.693 --> 14:10.051
for the swarm king
in the first place, remember?

14:10.323 --> 14:14.559
Yeah, that's when we thought
it was a hive, not so much of a maze.

14:14.916 --> 14:18.196
Oh, no. Is this starting to look familiar?

14:18.506 --> 14:21.022
- Are we?
- Going around in circles?

14:21.469 --> 14:23.860
- Great.
- Let's just orb home.

14:24.141 --> 14:27.501
Why are you in such a rush
to go home all of a sudden?

14:27.899 --> 14:32.580
It's Richard. Any time he's alone for
too long, bad things start to happen.

14:33.995 --> 14:35.555
No!

14:37.462 --> 14:39.614
That only attracts them more,
remember?

14:48.693 --> 14:50.366
Should we follow them?

14:50.611 --> 14:52.091
Good idea.

14:57.249 --> 14:58.604
- Now?
- Yeah.

15:29.186 --> 15:32.386
<i>"I call to thee, pure witch's fire</i>

15:32.692 --> 15:35.448
<i>Through vortex flow
The heavenly mire</i>

15:35.741 --> 15:38.099
<i>Cleanse brackish karma of debris</i>

15:38.371 --> 15:41.286
<i>From dark to light, sweep history"</i>

15:59.372 --> 16:01.410
Hello, anybody home?

16:35.775 --> 16:38.245
How many did we get, 15 or 16?

16:38.530 --> 16:41.046
I don't know,
I stopped counting at dawn.

16:41.328 --> 16:42.523
I'm gonna go crash.

16:42.748 --> 16:45.629
Actually, I'm gonna go check
on Richard, and then I'll go crash.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.801
But wait, we know where the king
is now, so we're gonna get Phoebe

16:49.094 --> 16:50.369
so we can go back and get him.

16:50.637 --> 16:55.351
No. I am taking a hot bath
and crawling into a nice, warm bed.

16:55.772 --> 16:58.528
You know, living at Richard's
mansion has made you soft.

16:59.071 --> 17:01.189
- Oh, shush.
- I'm serious. What if this is

17:01.493 --> 17:02.643
the demon that gets to Wyatt?

17:02.870 --> 17:05.830
Well, then it's all the more reason
for us to be well-rested, right?

17:09.008 --> 17:10.362
What happened here?

17:16.896 --> 17:18.730
What the heck are you wearing?

17:19.027 --> 17:21.338
Just a little something to
help me win my boyfriend back.

17:21.614 --> 17:24.529
- Showing a little skin never hurt.
- Oh, well, I'll file that away.

17:24.871 --> 17:27.592
I guess it didn't go so good
with Jason last night?

17:27.919 --> 17:29.991
No, unfortunately.

17:32.888 --> 17:34.527
Since when do you
speak freedom fry?

17:35.852 --> 17:39.131
I don't know, actually. It's kind of weird,
considering I hate the French.

17:39.442 --> 17:42.755
No, you don't.
You love everything about France.

17:43.117 --> 17:44.187
I do?

17:44.409 --> 17:46.527
Oh, then maybe
I just hate being dumped.

17:46.789 --> 17:48.224
All the more reason to go get him.

17:49.253 --> 17:52.566
Just there's one thing. See, we
kind of need the power of three

17:52.884 --> 17:55.924
for a vanquish, you know,
to save your nephew's future and all.

17:56.266 --> 17:58.657
Yeah, sorry. I can't.

18:06.369 --> 18:07.769
Please tell me she didn't...

18:07.997 --> 18:11.311
Cast a spell on herself?
I think she did.

18:18.101 --> 18:20.220
I can feel their pain.

18:20.897 --> 18:24.257
This is where they fought and died.

18:24.863 --> 18:27.140
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but this was your division.

18:28.245 --> 18:29.474
I'm afraid it was.

18:30.081 --> 18:31.596
Remember.

18:31.836 --> 18:34.990
This is going to hurt me
much more than it hurts you.

18:44.446 --> 18:47.805
It is time to bring the fight to them!

18:48.663 --> 18:52.899
Let the Charmed Ones feel our pain!

18:55.467 --> 18:59.623
I'm confused. How does
cleansing her aura get Jason back?

18:59.975 --> 19:02.172
No, Phoebe didn't cast
a spell, Richard did.

19:02.437 --> 19:04.475
Richard wants Jason back?

19:04.735 --> 19:06.215
No,

19:06.446 --> 19:09.840
Richard wants
to cleanse his karma...

19:10.162 --> 19:12.439
<i>Oh, my God, that's what
he used the Book for.</i>

19:12.709 --> 19:15.509
Damn it, I shouldn't
have left him alone.

19:15.799 --> 19:17.996
Wait a second, what does this
have to do with Phoebe?

19:18.261 --> 19:20.060
Karma is not something
you mess with.

19:20.307 --> 19:22.345
Especially not magically.
Whatever Richard did

19:22.603 --> 19:25.484
could have gone wonky
and affected her somehow.

19:25.776 --> 19:29.658
I mean, there's all this unfinished
karma just floating around out there,

19:29.992 --> 19:31.791
waiting to complete its cycle.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.518
What the hell are you talking about?

19:33.750 --> 19:36.744
I'm talking about Richard screwing
with the karmic wheel

19:37.089 --> 19:39.446
and Phoebe getting smacked
down by it. She said it herself.

19:39.719 --> 19:41.872
She's been lying to Jason,
living a double life.

19:42.141 --> 19:45.022
If that doesn't attract bad karma,
I don't know what does.

19:45.564 --> 19:47.682
Someone's unfinished bad karma?

19:47.945 --> 19:49.504
Exactly.

19:49.781 --> 19:51.182
Except whose?

19:51.659 --> 19:56.294
Well, I'd guess a French hooker,
by the way she's been acting.

19:56.669 --> 19:57.898
Or worse.

19:58.131 --> 20:01.251
Okay, you go get Phoebe,
I'll go get Richard.

20:01.595 --> 20:03.508
But what if he's infected too?

20:03.807 --> 20:06.768
Well, I'll save him
and then I'll kill him.

20:15.999 --> 20:17.719
Cast any spells lately?

20:18.002 --> 20:19.437
No.

20:19.715 --> 20:21.514
All right yeah, one.
It didn't work, though.

20:21.802 --> 20:24.113
- How do you know?
- Because.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.425
All right, I was cleansing my soul...

20:26.728 --> 20:28.209
Yeah, yeah.
Skip down to the bottom.

20:28.441 --> 20:31.196
What happened when you
set the spell, exactly?

20:31.530 --> 20:35.493
The energy and light came down
from the ceiling and it surrounded me...

20:35.829 --> 20:39.222
- And hit Phoebe.
- No. I was there alone.

20:39.587 --> 20:41.864
Oh, yeah, you were alone.
Then how do you explain my sister

20:42.133 --> 20:44.934
<i>suddenly walking around like she's
in the nudie version of Les Mis?</i>

20:45.265 --> 20:46.746
I don't know. l...

20:46.976 --> 20:49.413
I don't know why
it affected her and not me.

20:50.442 --> 20:52.912
Maybe because your family is
surrounded by so much bad karma

20:53.196 --> 20:55.154
that there's no room
for anybody else's.

20:57.497 --> 20:59.136
What were you thinking?

20:59.417 --> 21:00.977
I was thinking about us.

21:01.254 --> 21:03.612
- Us?
- Yeah.

21:03.926 --> 21:05.805
I don't want my past to hurt you.

21:07.725 --> 21:11.084
Richard, I know that you
mean well, I really do.

21:11.441 --> 21:16.840
And I get that it must be so hard
to not practise magic when you can.

21:17.244 --> 21:19.807
- But you can't...
- How can you be with a guy

21:20.083 --> 21:22.998
that's got a problem
with the very thing you're all about?

21:26.511 --> 21:27.707
I have an idea.

21:28.349 --> 21:29.830
I have a potion that'll help Phoebe.

21:31.563 --> 21:33.442
- Richard.
- What?

21:33.734 --> 21:36.649
- Just stop.
- I can't. I did this.

21:36.949 --> 21:38.781
I need to fix it.

21:39.998 --> 21:41.432
No. Hey.

21:41.666 --> 21:42.782
Please.

21:43.045 --> 21:44.115
Just...

21:44.339 --> 21:45.899
...no more magic.

21:55.693 --> 21:58.005
- Hey, bro.
- Richard.

21:58.282 --> 22:00.240
Man, how the hell have you been?

22:02.331 --> 22:04.085
Good, good, you know.

22:04.336 --> 22:06.772
Well, you look good
and you got your hair cut.

22:07.092 --> 22:10.087
Yeah, for court.
I'm doing pro bono now.

22:10.431 --> 22:12.105
A do-gooder. Wow, you.

22:12.394 --> 22:14.432
Yeah, I needed a change in my life.

22:14.690 --> 22:16.330
So Mom's been worried.

22:17.154 --> 22:20.547
No one's heard from you.
Staying out of trouble, I hope?

22:20.910 --> 22:24.384
- Yeah. More or less.
- So you still seeing Paige?

22:24.749 --> 22:26.946
Absolutely.
I can't imagine life without her.

22:27.255 --> 22:29.212
- Sounds serious.
- I hope so.

22:29.468 --> 22:30.743
Well, here, man, take a seat.

22:30.970 --> 22:32.690
Actually, I can't. I gotta go.

22:32.975 --> 22:36.050
I've been going through some of the
old potion books just for the hell of it,

22:36.398 --> 22:39.711
and I can't find that one
Dad used to use to banish spirits.

22:40.031 --> 22:41.067
You know where it is?

22:41.326 --> 22:43.478
I thought we both agreed
not to mess with that anymore.

22:43.748 --> 22:46.868
I'm not. Not really.
It's hard to explain.

22:47.171 --> 22:48.765
- Do you know where it is?
- Richard...

22:49.050 --> 22:51.361
Look, save the speech.
Can you help me or not?

22:51.679 --> 22:53.512
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

22:53.809 --> 22:56.531
- Are people hurt? Do you need...?
- Damn it, Steve!

22:56.857 --> 22:58.611
Can you help me or not?

23:01.949 --> 23:03.543
Please.

23:10.090 --> 23:11.605
What are you doing here?

23:14.850 --> 23:16.079
And what are you wearing?

23:16.311 --> 23:18.224
I'm looking for you.

23:19.735 --> 23:22.855
Look, I don't have time
for this. This is crazy.

23:23.158 --> 23:25.151
You have every right
to be very upset with me.

23:25.411 --> 23:27.290
I know I've been a very, very bad girl.

23:27.541 --> 23:29.534
Please let me make it up to you.

23:29.797 --> 23:30.947
I don't think so.

23:31.215 --> 23:33.367
- What do you mean, don't think so?
- Take it easy.

23:33.636 --> 23:35.834
We'll talk about it later, okay?
Now I'm running late.

23:36.308 --> 23:38.905
<i>There's always time for I'amour.</i>

23:42.695 --> 23:44.653
Listen, this is... l...

23:44.951 --> 23:48.151
This merger is
very important to me, okay?

23:48.457 --> 23:50.928
I need to keep a clear head,
if that's at all possible.

23:52.256 --> 23:53.895
Are you saying you don't want me?

23:54.761 --> 23:55.877
Not right now, okay?

23:57.058 --> 23:58.731
You pig.

24:01.191 --> 24:02.864
You're crazy.

24:04.238 --> 24:05.957
You think you could just
walk away from me?

24:06.201 --> 24:08.512
You think I'm crazy?
You think this is crazy?

24:12.838 --> 24:14.193
Just wait.

24:14.841 --> 24:18.440
In the climate of this world economy,
diversity is essential.

24:18.767 --> 24:21.204
And that is why
this merger is essential

24:21.480 --> 24:23.871
if we want to grow as a company.

24:24.403 --> 24:26.236
Combining resources

24:26.490 --> 24:29.052
will allow us to tap into markets
that would have otherwise

24:29.329 --> 24:31.686
remained beyond our reach.

24:33.629 --> 24:35.188
And so today we celebrate

24:35.425 --> 24:38.100
a new Franco-American
business community,

24:38.389 --> 24:42.386
in which bilateral trade
is not only encouraged...

25:09.240 --> 25:11.039
What the hell are you doing?

25:11.286 --> 25:13.438
You turned on me.

25:13.917 --> 25:16.069
You rejected me.

25:16.338 --> 25:19.698
And I'd say that you'd live
to regret it, but you won't.

25:20.011 --> 25:22.049
This isn't a game.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.569
Jesus.

25:25.021 --> 25:26.341
Phoebe, you can't do this.

25:26.564 --> 25:29.286
Oh, no? Watch me.

25:30.490 --> 25:32.005
Curses on this merger.

25:54.745 --> 25:57.057
- Stop this.
- You let go of me.

25:59.004 --> 26:00.643
Are you trying to ruin me?

26:00.924 --> 26:02.279
That's just the hors d'oeuvre.

26:02.511 --> 26:05.312
Wait until you see the entr?e.
It's to die for.

26:17.917 --> 26:19.750
Leo!

26:24.178 --> 26:26.775
Leo. Leo.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.835
Yeah.

26:32.151 --> 26:33.905
Wh...? Why is Phoebe frozen?

26:34.156 --> 26:35.910
- That's not Phoebe.
- What do you mean?

26:36.160 --> 26:37.959
Long story. Let's get out of here.

26:38.247 --> 26:41.128
- What about all this?
- Later, later.

26:49.228 --> 26:50.822
Phoebe?

27:07.765 --> 27:11.808
- Sit down and put this on.
- I'm not finished with my revenge.

27:12.190 --> 27:15.869
Sit or I will freeze. We need to
figure out whose karma you got.

27:16.239 --> 27:17.674
I'll never tell.

27:19.538 --> 27:21.691
Okay, she's French.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.232
Bad karma. Napoleon?

27:24.757 --> 27:26.032
Probably not.

27:26.259 --> 27:27.409
Phoebe's not our only problem.

27:27.636 --> 27:29.356
That entire auditorium
saw her use magic.

27:29.641 --> 27:32.442
Well, we fix Phoebe first, and then we
take care of the swarm king

27:32.730 --> 27:35.406
and if we're still alive
after that, we'll worry about it then.

27:37.322 --> 27:40.044
Maybe you should go check
on Wyatt, make sure he's okay.

27:40.495 --> 27:42.215
He's fine.

27:43.084 --> 27:44.200
Okay, I'll go check.

27:48.260 --> 27:52.655
Let's see if I can piece together
a spell to de-karma Phoebe.

27:53.020 --> 27:55.582
Okay, what about Marie Antoinette,

27:55.858 --> 27:58.455
Queen Isabella,
the she-wolf of France?

27:58.781 --> 28:01.742
Oh, now you insult me.
I can't stand France.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.434
Vital clue there?

28:03.666 --> 28:06.023
Okay, let's see. Speaks French,

28:06.296 --> 28:07.855
hates the country,

28:08.092 --> 28:10.130
more than willing to strip in public...

28:10.388 --> 28:12.984
Oh, my God,
I saw something in here.

28:13.310 --> 28:15.382
Famous females spies:

28:15.647 --> 28:17.685
Mata Hari.

28:17.985 --> 28:20.103
Wasn't she one of the Bond girls?

28:20.366 --> 28:23.839
No. Look, an exotic stripper in Paris,

28:24.163 --> 28:28.080
Dutch-born, double agent
for Germany during World War I,

28:28.464 --> 28:32.255
it says here Mata Hari was
convicted by French officials

28:32.597 --> 28:35.113
and executed by a firing squad.

28:35.437 --> 28:37.509
Well, no wonder
she hates the French.

28:37.816 --> 28:40.572
Not half as much
as I hate you for keeping me here.

28:40.864 --> 28:43.461
I need my freedom.
I need my revenge.

28:44.037 --> 28:46.600
What does her karma
have to do with Phoebe?

28:46.875 --> 28:51.157
Well, duplicitous, living a
double life? Ring any bells?

28:51.552 --> 28:53.465
Enough!

28:53.722 --> 28:55.601
Where are you going?

29:03.157 --> 29:06.790
Hi. Look, it's two against one,
and you are not going any...

29:14.388 --> 29:16.905
Why am I always the one getting hit?

29:17.562 --> 29:18.838
Behind you.

29:27.621 --> 29:29.215
Take her!

29:38.101 --> 29:42.542
Am I crazy, or was she trying
to save them from us?

29:44.573 --> 29:47.886
I didn't tell you to bring her here.
I ordered you to kill them.

29:48.205 --> 29:50.004
The Charmed Ones
were all together.

29:50.293 --> 29:52.013
We were lucky to grab one
and get away.

29:52.296 --> 29:55.132
Oh, luck had nothing to do with it,
I saved your butts back there.

29:56.470 --> 29:58.064
Excuse me.

29:58.349 --> 29:59.499
Are you in charge here?

30:00.019 --> 30:01.658
I am.

30:05.196 --> 30:08.430
Good. Because I'd like
to get into bed with you.

30:09.664 --> 30:11.338
Not literally.

30:11.584 --> 30:13.064
Although...

30:13.296 --> 30:15.254
...there may be time for that later.

30:17.345 --> 30:19.463
What I'm saying is,

30:19.725 --> 30:23.438
if you help me, I'll help you.

30:28.367 --> 30:32.249
You think I'm a fool?
Save my drones to gain my favour?

30:32.582 --> 30:34.700
I'm not one to fall for tricks.

30:35.004 --> 30:37.680
This isn't a trick. Hands off me.

30:38.678 --> 30:41.912
The witches have
double-crossed me.

30:43.312 --> 30:45.545
They want to keep me
against my will.

30:45.859 --> 30:47.419
So do I.

30:47.697 --> 30:49.735
Yeah, let me guess.

30:50.201 --> 30:53.595
To lure them here
so you can kill all of us?

30:54.417 --> 30:57.093
Yeah, see, you're not
the first demon to try that and fail.

30:59.219 --> 31:01.212
They've got good karma.

31:01.474 --> 31:05.232
Centuries of it.
It's what protects them.

31:05.565 --> 31:08.640
- Us.
- And what is it that you suggest?

31:09.155 --> 31:12.947
Well, I was hoping
that you could help me create

31:13.288 --> 31:16.567
some bad karma for them by...

31:16.921 --> 31:19.642
Oh, I don't know,
maybe killing an innocent?

31:20.345 --> 31:21.860
Who did you have in mind?

31:23.516 --> 31:25.349
Jason.

31:27.149 --> 31:29.665
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for Phoebe. You seen her?

31:29.988 --> 31:32.265
Not since she
destroyed my career, no.

31:32.534 --> 31:34.288
Listen, I gotta give
a press conference,

31:34.538 --> 31:36.212
try to salvage
what's left of my reputation.

31:36.501 --> 31:38.414
Don't go. All right?

31:39.130 --> 31:41.852
- I know how you feel.
- Oh, you know how I feel?

31:42.137 --> 31:44.778
Do you know how it feels to have
the woman you love lie to you,

31:45.101 --> 31:48.733
to turn your one shining
moment into chaos? And to...

31:49.067 --> 31:51.537
...strip in front
of a packed auditorium?

31:51.821 --> 31:53.700
No. Look,

31:53.952 --> 31:56.514
it's not her fault. You want
to blame somebody, blame me.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.748
- I cast a spell that...
- Hold on.

32:00.589 --> 32:02.786
- You too?
- Yeah, look.

32:03.053 --> 32:05.649
There's no time to explain,
just take this, please.

32:05.933 --> 32:07.493
The moment you see
Phoebe, throw this,

32:07.729 --> 32:09.449
she'll be back to normal. I promise.

32:09.691 --> 32:12.288
Wait a second. What is that?

32:12.739 --> 32:14.538
It's a potion.

32:15.118 --> 32:17.874
- Get out of here.
- Look, I screwed up big time, all right?

32:18.208 --> 32:21.760
The only way to fix this
is to use this on Phoebe.

32:22.590 --> 32:23.785
If you love her...

32:24.928 --> 32:26.568
...you'll do it.

32:34.029 --> 32:36.705
Well, if you would just hold still...

32:37.788 --> 32:41.022
Fine. There, you're done.

32:42.965 --> 32:45.083
We wouldn't be in this mess
if it weren't for Phoebe

32:45.344 --> 32:47.702
not being able to deal with conflict.

32:47.975 --> 32:50.538
Actually, we wouldn't be in this mess

32:50.813 --> 32:53.614
if your boyfriend
could handle his magic.

32:54.069 --> 32:55.982
Ow, you did that on purpose.

32:56.239 --> 32:57.355
Yes, I did.

32:58.870 --> 33:01.512
Maybe we should just focus
on how to save Phoebe.

33:01.792 --> 33:04.262
Well, we could storm the hive,
but then again,

33:04.549 --> 33:06.381
she'd probably just
help them stop us.

33:06.677 --> 33:08.111
That's just Mata Hari
coming through,

33:08.347 --> 33:10.226
using whoever she can
to exact her revenge.

33:10.476 --> 33:13.790
But against who? The men who
put her to death are long gone.

33:14.109 --> 33:15.783
And besides, doesn't her real karma

33:16.030 --> 33:18.706
eventually lead to her own
self-destruction anyway?

33:19.035 --> 33:21.676
I think that's why we need to
figure out why she's using Phoebe

33:21.957 --> 33:23.277
before it's too late, right?

33:23.542 --> 33:25.900
Which brings us back
to Mata Hari's revenge.

33:26.298 --> 33:28.861
Okay, she spent
her life pleasing men,

33:29.137 --> 33:32.177
only to be betrayed
by them at the end.

33:33.395 --> 33:35.547
- Oh, no.
- What?

33:36.360 --> 33:38.796
What if she wants
to return the favour?

33:40.326 --> 33:42.683
- Mr. Dean.
- Mr. Dean.

33:43.416 --> 33:46.331
Just one quote. One quote, please.

33:47.466 --> 33:49.857
- What happened?
- What can you tell us about that?

33:50.430 --> 33:52.502
Listen up. I'll answer
at the press conference.

33:52.767 --> 33:56.525
Please do me a favour
and hold your questions until then.

33:58.528 --> 34:01.489
- Hello, Jason.
- Phoebe, I've had enough.

34:05.417 --> 34:09.572
- I always get my man.
- Wait, hang on a sec...

34:19.737 --> 34:22.379
I swear, this is where
we found the king last time.

34:22.658 --> 34:24.456
Well, maybe your orbing was off.

34:24.704 --> 34:27.983
My orbing was not off.
It just moved.

34:28.295 --> 34:31.688
Well, we should be hearing
the swarm, so why don't we?

34:32.011 --> 34:33.650
Because there's a jillion miles

34:33.888 --> 34:36.688
of this stupid maze.
They could be anywhere.

34:36.978 --> 34:39.175
We don't even know
if Phoebe is here.

34:39.442 --> 34:41.674
Well, it's our best bet.

34:41.947 --> 34:45.420
I swear, if she is hurt, I am
never going to forgive Richard.

34:45.746 --> 34:49.139
I think Jason's the one
we need to worry about right now.

34:56.306 --> 34:59.382
Such a sweet man.

34:59.690 --> 35:02.252
And such a horrible way to die.

35:03.156 --> 35:04.955
I almost want to cry.

35:05.202 --> 35:06.431
- Almost.
- What are you doing?

35:06.663 --> 35:08.097
Please stop this game.

35:08.374 --> 35:11.130
Life is a game.
The last one standing wins.

35:11.422 --> 35:12.982
- And that would be me.
- I get it.

35:13.258 --> 35:14.693
You're trying to teach me a lesson.

35:14.971 --> 35:16.121
No lesson.

35:16.349 --> 35:17.830
I just don't like being betrayed.

35:18.895 --> 35:20.967
Well, what about him,
won't he betray you?

35:22.609 --> 35:26.606
<i>- Goodbye, mi amor.
- Phoebe, please. I'm begging you.</i>

35:26.994 --> 35:29.875
Oh, don't beg.

35:30.167 --> 35:32.160
I stared at my killer right in the eye.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.939
It's a much more
dignified way to die.

35:36.012 --> 35:37.685
Richard was right.

35:37.975 --> 35:39.250
- Who?
- Enough!

35:39.937 --> 35:42.499
Can we please get on with this?

35:43.485 --> 35:45.125
Ready.

35:51.626 --> 35:52.742
Aim.

36:00.976 --> 36:02.252
No.

36:03.899 --> 36:05.300
Fire!

36:14.212 --> 36:16.523
Oh, thank God, I'm so happy
to see you guys.

36:16.801 --> 36:18.521
- You're you.
- Yeah.

36:18.762 --> 36:21.119
Okay, reunion later, slay now.

36:21.435 --> 36:23.632
Fire at her!

36:24.231 --> 36:25.950
<i>"Demon swarm that serves as one</i>

36:26.192 --> 36:28.345
<i>Vanquish him from which they come"</i>

36:35.002 --> 36:36.562
Jason.

36:38.635 --> 36:41.550
I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

36:41.849 --> 36:43.203
Me too.

36:43.436 --> 36:46.111
I hate to break this up,
I really do, but we gotta go.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.472
How did you get rid
of Mata Hari's karma?

36:49.490 --> 36:50.719
- Who?
- Don't ask.

36:50.992 --> 36:52.871
Where did you get the potion from?

36:53.120 --> 36:56.958
I got it from Richard, he said it would
be the only thing that might save you.

36:57.754 --> 36:59.393
Richard.

37:31.863 --> 37:33.901
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah, you know,

37:34.160 --> 37:37.633
considering I'm the mother
of the future leader of all evil.

37:37.959 --> 37:39.872
No, you're not.

37:40.463 --> 37:43.538
Okay, maybe he won't be, now that
you took care of the last threat on him.

37:43.845 --> 37:48.048
You know as well as I do that was not
the last threat. There'll be others.

37:48.396 --> 37:50.070
And you'll take care of them too.

37:50.317 --> 37:53.198
Especially now that we
know what can happen.

37:53.489 --> 37:56.052
After all, well aware is half there.

37:56.328 --> 37:58.639
Did Phoebe give you
that psychobabble?

38:01.172 --> 38:05.966
I just don't understand how someone
so sweet could possibly turn...

38:06.973 --> 38:08.931
...so bad.

38:09.228 --> 38:10.901
I don't believe he will.

38:11.149 --> 38:12.629
Despite what Chris says.

38:12.860 --> 38:15.980
Or, maybe because of it,
we won't let it.

38:16.994 --> 38:19.636
You know, Piper, all parents
worry about their kids.

38:19.916 --> 38:22.068
It's part of the job description.

38:22.505 --> 38:24.304
We just have to have faith.

38:24.591 --> 38:27.153
Yeah, but Wyatt isn't just any kid.

38:27.473 --> 38:30.593
And we're not just any parents either.

38:33.610 --> 38:36.844
Well, at least we know he'll
inherit all of our family's good karma.

38:37.157 --> 38:38.353
And that should help.

38:38.577 --> 38:39.977
I hope it helps Phoebe too.

38:40.204 --> 38:43.244
She still has what happened
at Jason's banquet to worry about.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.651
Mr. Dean.

38:49.015 --> 38:50.769
Here you are, sir.

38:54.149 --> 38:55.709
Jason!

38:55.945 --> 38:57.265
Jason!

38:57.488 --> 38:59.128
Phoebe?

39:02.749 --> 39:05.903
I want to talk to the press.
I want to tell them everything.

39:06.215 --> 39:08.094
What are you gonna do?
Tell them you're a witch?

39:08.345 --> 39:10.065
That'll make the headlines.

39:10.349 --> 39:13.344
Actually, I didn't think about
what I was gonna say to them.

39:13.647 --> 39:16.561
I just know that I can't let you
take the fall for this.

39:17.488 --> 39:19.128
I am so sorry.

39:19.366 --> 39:23.922
- About everything. The lies and...
- Hey.

39:24.417 --> 39:25.977
Don't.

39:26.254 --> 39:29.294
- Remember, you saved me.
- But that was after I tried to kill you.

39:29.594 --> 39:31.075
Well, there was that.

39:35.481 --> 39:38.157
If I could do it all again,

39:38.446 --> 39:39.927
I would tell you the truth.

39:40.200 --> 39:42.432
What are you gonna do,
what are you gonna tell me?

39:43.080 --> 39:44.753
And besides, I was...

39:45.001 --> 39:47.836
I was so wrapped up in my career
and dragging you around the world,

39:48.131 --> 39:49.850
I never gave you a chance.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.363
So...

39:56.606 --> 39:58.166
...what do we do now?

39:58.776 --> 40:00.416
I don't know.

40:02.368 --> 40:04.440
Maybe we should just...

40:06.626 --> 40:08.346
...both take some time.

40:14.767 --> 40:16.248
They're waiting for me.

40:18.775 --> 40:20.415
I wish you'd let me talk to them.

40:20.694 --> 40:23.495
No. No, what you
and your sisters do,

40:23.783 --> 40:26.174
what I saw you do...

40:26.455 --> 40:27.730
...it...

40:28.293 --> 40:30.934
...put some perspective
on my work.

40:31.716 --> 40:33.549
I want to protect that.

40:35.432 --> 40:37.550
You might lose the merger.

40:38.020 --> 40:39.501
I've lost worse.
