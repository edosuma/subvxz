Understood. Thank you, sir.

So, the pentagon
denied our request

30:57.289 --> 30:58.922
To see the base's
security logs.

30:58.924 --> 31:01.091
What a surprise.
They can do that?

31:01.093 --> 31:02.292
Disclosing the admiral's
whereabouts at any given time

31:02.294 --> 31:04.561
Is apparently a matter
of national security.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.263

What do you think
of a system of justice

31:13.572 --> 31:16.506
That doesn't allow the defense
to see the evidence?

31:16.508 --> 31:19.209
Let me guess.
This isn't a social call.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.578
Do you think it's appalling?
Or maybe just flat-out corrupt?

31:21.580 --> 31:24.047
I guess it depends
on what context you --

31:24.049 --> 31:25.515
No. Don't "context" your way
out of this one.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.051
If you saw this kind of
blatant disregard for the truth

31:28.053 --> 31:29.386
In any other country
of the world,

31:29.388 --> 31:31.121
You would condemn it
out of hand.

You can't sue the u.S.
Government if you're raped

Because it's considered
the same

on the battlefield?

31:56.315 --> 31:58.315

It's the feres doctrine.
