00:35.602 --> 00:35.902
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:35.969 --> 00:36.302
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:36.369 --> 00:41.007
FOR JOINING US.

00:41.074 --> 00:43.009
IT HAS BEEN ANOTHER BUSY WEEK.

00:43.076 --> 00:44.944
THE FLAGSHIP OF THE RUSSIAN NAVY

00:45.011 --> 00:45.145
SANK.

00:45.211 --> 00:49.616
THE KARDASHIANS RETURNED TO TV.

00:49.682 --> 00:53.987
IN TENNESSEE A STATE LAWMAKER

00:54.053 --> 00:55.288
FOR A BILL TO CRIMINALIZE

00:55.355 --> 00:55.989
CAMPING MADE THIS ARGUMENT.

00:56.055 --> 00:57.957
>> I WANT TO GIVE YOU A HISTORY

00:58.024 --> 01:01.361
OF HOMELESSNESS.

01:01.428 --> 01:01.961
HITLER DECIDED TO LIVE ON THE

01:02.028 --> 01:05.432
STREETS FOR A WHILE SO FOR TWO

01:05.498 --> 01:07.133
YEARS HITLER LIVED ON THE

01:07.200 --> 01:08.635
STREETS AND PRACTICE HIS ORATORY

01:08.701 --> 01:09.702
AND BODY LANGUAGE AND HOW TO

01:09.769 --> 01:11.438
CONNECT WITH THE MASSES AND THEN

01:11.504 --> 01:13.339
WENT ON TO LEAD A LIFE THAT GOT

01:13.406 --> 01:15.108
HIM IN THE HISTORY BOOKS.

01:15.175 --> 01:17.577
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE, IT'S NOT

01:17.644 --> 01:17.844
INDENTED.

01:17.911 --> 01:18.711
THEY CAN COME OUT OF THESE

01:18.778 --> 01:21.114
HOMELESS CAMPS AND HAVE A

01:21.181 --> 01:22.348
PRODUCTIVE LIFE.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.651
IN HITLER'S CASE, VERY

01:24.717 --> 01:27.587
UNPRODUCTIVE LIFE.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.722
>> FUCKING TALKING

01:29.789 --> 01:30.557
ABOUT.

01:30.623 --> 01:31.624
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

01:31.691 --> 01:32.926
USING THE AGE-OLD WHAT IF A

01:32.992 --> 01:36.362
HOMELESS PERSON WAS EXCEPT IN

01:36.429 --> 01:39.966
HIS EXAMPLE, BUT A PERSON'S

01:40.033 --> 01:40.733
HITLER, ADOLF HITLER AND THE

01:40.800 --> 01:41.968
HOMELESSNESS SOMEHOW ONLY MADE

01:42.035 --> 01:44.070
HIM STRONGER BUT INSTEAD OF

01:44.137 --> 01:44.671
GOING DOWN THAT WORMHOLE WERE

01:44.737 --> 01:46.639
GOING TO FOCUS ON THE MIDTERM

01:46.706 --> 01:47.373
ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.043
A RUN UP OF SOME IMPORTANT PARTY

01:50.109 --> 01:50.944
PRIMARIES.

01:51.010 --> 01:51.845
PENNSYLVANIANS IS A MONTH AWAY

01:51.911 --> 01:54.047
AND IT'S A STATE THAT COULD WELL

01:54.113 --> 01:55.148
DETERMINE WHO CONTROLS THE

01:55.215 --> 01:56.449
SENATE AND ITS PRIMARY WAS

01:56.516 --> 01:57.550
SHAKEN UP RECENTLY BY THIS.

01:57.617 --> 02:00.153
>> BY THE WAY, I ENDORSED

02:00.220 --> 02:01.754
ANOTHER PERSON TODAY.

02:01.821 --> 02:04.157
DR. OZ IN PENNSYLVANIA.

02:04.224 --> 02:05.892
DR. OZ.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.227
GREAT GUY, GOOD MAN.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.295
WHEN YOU'RE IN FOR 18 YEARS,

02:09.362 --> 02:10.663
IT'S LIKE A POLL.

02:10.730 --> 02:13.199
THAT MEANS PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

02:13.266 --> 02:13.933
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.568
>> WOW.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.303
I HADN'T HEARD THAT VOICE IN A

02:17.370 --> 02:19.172
WHILE AND TO BE HONEST I REALLY

02:19.239 --> 02:20.406
HAVEN'T MISSED IT.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.875
THE FIRST GROWL IN THAT CLIP WAS

02:21.941 --> 02:23.243
LIKE HEARING THE SOUND OF A

02:23.309 --> 02:25.778
CRANKING A LOT MORE YOU KNOW IS

02:25.845 --> 02:26.513
ABOUT TO SEXUALLY HARASS YOU.

02:26.579 --> 02:29.082
AS FOR HIS CLAIM THAT BEING ON

02:29.148 --> 02:31.451
TV FOR A LONG TIME IS LIKE OH

02:31.518 --> 02:32.819
POLL SHOWING PEOPLE LIKE YOU,

02:32.886 --> 02:40.560
THAT IS JUST NOT TRUE.

02:40.627 --> 02:40.860
BELIEVE ME.

02:40.927 --> 02:41.494
I'VE BEEN ON TV IN THIS COUNTRY

02:41.561 --> 02:42.128
FOR 16 YEARS NOW AND I STILL GET

02:42.195 --> 02:42.762
YOU TO COMMENTS LIKE "I HOPE HE

02:42.829 --> 02:44.397
STOPS SOON.

02:44.464 --> 02:47.267
"AND "THE MOST UNWATCHABLE THING

02:47.333 --> 02:50.236
ON TELEVISION.

02:50.303 --> 02:53.706
WHY DOES HE ALWAYS LOOKS AT?"

02:53.773 --> 02:55.408
TRUMP HAS ENDORSED DR. OZ WE

02:55.475 --> 02:57.510
HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE DAYTIME

02:57.577 --> 02:59.045
SNAKE OIL CARNIVAL SO I DIDN'T

02:59.112 --> 03:01.247
THINK HIS CAMPAIGN COULD

03:01.314 --> 03:03.316
SURPRISE ME BUT IT HAS BECAUSE

03:03.383 --> 03:05.485
IT'S BEEN A SHIT SHOW.

03:05.552 --> 03:07.353
HE'S LIVED IN NEW JERSEY AND HIS

03:07.420 --> 03:08.788
SOCIAL MEDIA SO FREQUENTLY SHOWS

03:08.855 --> 03:10.189
HIM AT HIS NORTH JERSEY MANSION

03:10.256 --> 03:12.625
SO HE'S RUNNING FOR OFFICE IN A

03:12.692 --> 03:13.793
STATE HE DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT TO

03:13.860 --> 03:16.095
LIVE IN, A SAVVY POLITICAL MOVE

03:16.162 --> 03:18.598
KNOWN AS THE ERIC ADAM SPECIAL.

03:18.665 --> 03:20.600
WHEN HE WASN'T IN NEW JERSEY HE

03:20.667 --> 03:21.334
WAS OFTEN HERE IN NEW YORK AND

03:21.401 --> 03:25.204
THE I KNOW THAT IS HIS SHOW

03:25.271 --> 03:26.973
FILMED IN THIS STUDIO.

03:27.040 --> 03:27.607
HIS OFFICES WERE RIGHT ACROSS

03:27.674 --> 03:29.375
THE HALL FROM OURS AND I'M NOT

03:29.442 --> 03:31.110
SAYING THAT'S WHY AFTER WE MADE

03:31.177 --> 03:33.446
THIS PROP OF A GIANT ALLIGATOR

03:33.513 --> 03:35.248
GIVING THE FINGER, WE SET IT UP

03:35.315 --> 03:37.083
IN OUR RECEPTION AREA DIRECTLY

03:37.150 --> 03:39.218
FACING HIS OFFICES BUT IT DID

03:39.285 --> 03:40.320
SEEM AN APPROPRIATE WAY FOR THEM

03:40.386 --> 03:42.188
TO BE GREETED EVERY MORNING.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.957
I SAVED OVERCOMPENSATE FOR

03:44.023 --> 03:45.491
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS RESIDENCY,

03:45.558 --> 03:47.794
DR. OZ HAS BEEN POSTING PHOTOS

03:47.860 --> 03:49.562
AND VIDEOS FROM ALL OVER

03:49.629 --> 03:51.197
PENNSYLVANIA LIKE THIS ONE OF

03:51.264 --> 03:52.632
HIM AND HIS WIFE AT A

03:52.699 --> 03:53.600
PITTSBURGH PENGUINS GAME AND

03:53.666 --> 03:54.067
LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO

03:54.133 --> 03:55.802
APPRECIATE HIS WIFE'S

03:55.868 --> 03:57.203
EXPRESSION.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.739
THAT'S A LOOK THAT SCREAMS "I'M

03:59.806 --> 04:02.208
IN PITTSBURGH WITH DR. OZ."

04:02.275 --> 04:04.444
HE'S ALSO BEEN GOING OUT OF HIS

04:04.510 --> 04:06.346
WAY TO EMPATHIZE WITH THE

04:06.412 --> 04:07.246
CONCERNS OF REGULAR

04:07.313 --> 04:07.981
PENNSYLVANIANS LIKE THIS.

04:08.047 --> 04:10.316
>> DOING SOME GROCERY SHOPPING.

04:10.383 --> 04:12.318
I AM AT WENGER'S.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.153
MY WIFE WANTS SOME VEGETABLES

04:14.220 --> 04:14.721
FOR A CRUDITES.

04:14.787 --> 04:16.055
HERE'S BROCCOLI.

04:16.122 --> 04:18.758
THAT'S TWO BUCKS.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.293
HERE'S SOME ASPARAGUS.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.563
THAT'S $4.

04:23.630 --> 04:24.297
CARROTS.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.933
THAT'S FOUR MORE DOLLARS, $10 OF

04:27.000 --> 04:28.167
VEGETABLES.

04:28.234 --> 04:29.502
WE NEED SOME GUACAMOLE.

04:29.569 --> 04:32.572
THAT'S $4 OR MORE.

04:32.639 --> 04:33.806
SHE LOVES SALSA.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.508
THEY HAVE SULCI.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.577
$6?

04:37.644 --> 04:39.912
MUST BE A SHORTAGE OF SULCI.

04:39.979 --> 04:42.215
$20 FOR CRUDITES AND IT DOESN'T

04:42.281 --> 04:43.316
INCLUDE THE TEQUILA.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.283
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.319
WE HAVE JOE BIDEN TO THANK FOR

04:46.386 --> 04:46.519
THIS.

04:46.586 --> 04:47.320
>> OKAY.

04:47.387 --> 04:49.422
THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK STARTING

04:49.489 --> 04:51.924
WITH THAT DR. OZ WENT TO A

04:51.991 --> 04:53.693
GROCERY STORE DRESSED LIKE

04:53.760 --> 04:55.528
DEXTER BEFORE A SERIAL MURDER.

04:55.595 --> 05:00.033
HE CALLS THE STORE WEGNER'S.

05:00.099 --> 05:05.204
THAT'S A WENGER'S.

05:05.271 --> 05:06.806
WHAT'S THAT SLAPDASH CRUDITES

05:06.873 --> 05:07.540
NIGHTMARE.

05:07.607 --> 05:08.608
NO BELL PEPPERS?

05:08.675 --> 05:10.076
NO SALARY.

05:10.143 --> 05:10.643
WHERE IS THE HUMMUS?

05:10.710 --> 05:14.213
IT REQUIRES A THICK DIP.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.417
IF THE DIP AIN'T THICK, THE DIP

05:17.483 --> 05:18.284
DON'T STICK.

05:18.351 --> 05:20.353
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HIS WIFE'S

05:20.420 --> 05:21.087
FACE WHEN HE BROUGHT THE

05:21.154 --> 05:22.088
INGREDIENTS LIKE THIS BUT I

05:22.155 --> 05:23.289
DON'T HAVE TO BECAUSE IT

05:23.356 --> 05:24.524
PROBABLY LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE

05:24.590 --> 05:26.159
THIS AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY

05:26.225 --> 05:28.327
TIME DR. OZ HAS TRIED TO CONNECT

05:28.394 --> 05:29.729
WITH FOLKS OVER HIGH PRICES.

05:29.796 --> 05:30.763
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE THINGS TO DO

05:30.830 --> 05:33.966
IS TO SHOW HIMSELF PUMPING GAS

05:34.033 --> 05:34.233
ON TIKTOK.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.969
>> YOU KNOW WHY GAS COST SO MUCH

05:37.036 --> 05:37.470
MONEY?

05:37.537 --> 05:39.739
JOE BIDEN'S MISS MANAGER WERNER

05:39.806 --> 05:42.842
ENERGY PRODUCTION.

05:42.909 --> 05:46.713
300 BUCKS A WEEK.

05:46.779 --> 05:50.183
COSTS HAVE BEEN SKYROCKETING.

05:50.249 --> 05:54.087
HIGHEST IN 14 YEARS.

05:54.153 --> 05:55.988
ALMOST FIVE BUCKS.

05:56.055 --> 05:56.322
THAT'S CRAZY.

05:56.389 --> 05:57.657
>> GAS PRICES ARE REAL

05:57.724 --> 06:01.728
CONCERN BUT DR. OZ IS WORTH OVER

06:01.794 --> 06:02.328
A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SO

06:02.395 --> 06:03.596
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD FOR HIM TO

06:03.663 --> 06:04.530
ACT LIKE IT IS SPECIFICALLY

06:04.597 --> 06:05.832
STRAINING HIS BUDGET BUT MAYBE

06:05.898 --> 06:08.134
HE'S ONLY POSTING THOSE VIDEOS

06:08.201 --> 06:09.736
TO PUSH SLIGHTLY LESS RELATABLE

06:09.802 --> 06:11.938
CONTENT FURTHER DOWN HIS PAGE,

06:12.004 --> 06:16.075
LIKE I DON'T KNOW, THIS ONE.

06:22.014 --> 06:22.148
COOL.

06:22.215 --> 06:27.487
THAT IS DR. OZ WAKE SURFING WITH

06:27.553 --> 06:35.161
THE CAPTION SURFING THROUGH

06:35.228 --> 06:35.361
ITALY.

06:35.428 --> 06:35.962
THAT IS WHAT HIS LIFE BE LIKE

06:36.028 --> 06:36.496
BECAUSE HE'S FUCKING RICH.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.897
WHAT HE DOESN'T GET TO DO IS

06:37.964 --> 06:39.832
STAND IN FRONT OF GAS PUMPS AND

06:39.899 --> 06:42.001
PRETEND HE'S PERSONALLY AFFECTED

06:42.068 --> 06:42.969
BY THOSE NUMBERS.

06:43.035 --> 06:45.505
MANY REPUBLICANS DOUBT DR. OZ'S

06:45.571 --> 06:46.906
CONSERVATIVE BONA FIDES WHICH IS

06:46.973 --> 06:48.608
WHY HE HAS TACKED SO HARD TO THE

06:48.674 --> 06:50.243
RIGHT ON ISSUES LIKE GUN RIGHTS

06:50.309 --> 06:52.011
AND ABORTION SAYING HE DEFENDS

06:52.078 --> 06:54.313
THE MOST VULNERABLE, THE UNBORN.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.015
MAYBE THAT SHIFT TO THE RIGHT ON

06:56.082 --> 06:57.150
THE TRUMP ENDORSEMENT WILL HELP

06:57.216 --> 06:59.986
HIM WIN BUT IF THAT HAPPENS,

07:00.052 --> 07:00.553
IT'LL BE PRETTY REMARKABLE

07:00.620 --> 07:02.155
BECAUSE FOR A MAN WHO'S MADE A

07:02.221 --> 07:03.956
CAREER OUT OF TALKING INTO A

07:04.023 --> 07:06.359
CAMERA, IT'S AMAZING HOW BAD HE

07:06.425 --> 07:08.227
IS BENNETT DOING THAT DURING

07:08.294 --> 07:08.928
THIS CAMPAIGN.

07:08.995 --> 07:09.962
IT'S HONESTLY HER TYPICAL LOW

07:10.029 --> 07:11.631
POINT BUT I HAVE TO SHOW YOU

07:11.697 --> 07:14.033
THIS VIDEO FROM LAST MONTH WHERE

07:14.100 --> 07:16.169
HE SEEMS BEST-CASE SCENARIO

07:16.235 --> 07:16.536
EXHAUSTED.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.371
>> I WANT TO GIVE A BIG SHOUT

07:18.437 --> 07:19.972
OUT TO ALL THE PENNSYLVANIA

07:20.039 --> 07:21.707
HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLERS WHO ARE

07:21.774 --> 07:22.608
COMPETING TODAY IN HERSHEY AT

07:22.675 --> 07:25.311
THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.346
PENN STATE HEAD WRESTLING COACH

07:27.413 --> 07:28.581
AND AMERICAN WRESTLING LEGEND

07:28.648 --> 07:28.948
CALE SANDERSON.

07:29.015 --> 07:30.216
YOU KNOW WHO HE IS.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.918
HE HAS SAID PENNSYLVANIA

07:31.984 --> 07:34.821
HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLING IS THE

07:34.887 --> 07:36.522
BEST IN THE COUNTRY.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.391
THE PENN STATE PROGRAM COULD GET

07:38.457 --> 07:40.593
THESE FOLKS, THEY'D BE

07:40.660 --> 07:40.960
UNBEATABLE.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.562
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT I

07:42.628 --> 07:44.497
LIKE MOST, THE FACT THAT HE

07:44.564 --> 07:47.200
SEEMS TO BE PERFORMING A CAMEO

07:47.266 --> 07:47.600
NO ONE REQUESTED.

07:47.667 --> 07:52.171
SHOUT OUT TO CAEL SANDERSON.

07:52.238 --> 07:54.207
OR THE FACT THAT IT WAS POSTED

07:54.273 --> 07:55.875
57 P.M.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.644
DID YOU PREGAME A HIGH SCHOOL

07:58.711 --> 07:59.412
WRESTLING MATCH, YOU DEEPLY

07:59.478 --> 07:59.879
WEIRD MAN?

07:59.946 --> 08:01.948
I'M NOT SAYING IF DR. OZ LOSES

08:02.014 --> 08:03.015
PENNSYLVANIANS WHILE A BETTER

08:03.082 --> 08:04.684
OPTION ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET.

08:04.750 --> 08:05.384
THEY WON'T.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.320
HIS MAIN OPPONENT IS THIS GUY,

08:07.386 --> 08:08.688
DAVE McCORMICK, FORMER CEO FOR

08:08.754 --> 08:11.724
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST HEDGE FUND.

08:11.791 --> 08:12.458
THIS CAMPAIGN HAS ACTUALLY

08:12.525 --> 08:14.160
TAUGHT ME SOMETHING BECAUSE I

08:14.227 --> 08:16.963
TALKED A LOT OF SHIT ABOUT THE

08:17.029 --> 08:18.331
DR. OZ SHOW BECAUSE IT WAS

08:18.397 --> 08:25.538
UNREMITTINGLY TERRIBLE.

08:25.605 --> 08:26.105
WHAT IS NOW CLEAR IS THAT I

08:26.172 --> 08:26.739
DIDN'T APPRECIATE JUST HOW HARD

08:26.806 --> 08:27.373
HIS STAFF HAD TO WORK EVERY DAY

08:27.440 --> 08:28.007
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS AN EVEN

08:28.074 --> 08:28.541
WORSE.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.343
HE HAD TO ABANDON HIS SHOW TO

08:30.409 --> 08:30.910
RUN FOR SENATE.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.178
IF ANY OF HIS STAFF ARE COMING

08:32.245 --> 08:33.312
BACK TO OUR OFFICE IN THE COMING

08:33.379 --> 08:35.348
WEEKS TO CLEAR THEIR STUFF OUT,

08:35.414 --> 08:36.916
WE'VE LEFT THE NEW SPECIAL

08:36.983 --> 08:38.417
MESSAGE FOR THEM ON OUR

08:38.484 --> 08:39.986
ALLIGATOR.

08:40.052 --> 08:41.053
I'M SORRY.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.055
HE SEEMS LIKE A FUCKING

08:43.122 --> 08:43.389
NIGHTMARE.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.825
BECAUSE HE REALLY DOES.

08:45.892 --> 08:46.592
AND NOW THIS.

08:46.659 --> 08:47.693
>> AND NOW...

08:47.760 --> 08:52.098
THE PROFOUND DESPAIR OF HOLLOW

08:52.164 --> 08:52.832
CHOCOLATE BUNNIES.

08:52.899 --> 08:54.967
>> ITEM BEING A KID AND BITING

08:55.034 --> 08:56.269
INTO THE EASTER CHOCOLATE AND IT

08:56.335 --> 08:58.004
WAS HOLLOW BEING SO ANGRY.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.139
>> WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, WE

09:00.206 --> 09:00.606
HAVE THE HOLLOW ONES.

09:00.673 --> 09:10.316
>> THESE WERE DISAPPOINTING.

09:10.383 --> 09:10.616
YOU GET IT.

09:10.683 --> 09:11.017
IT LEFT ME EMPTY.

09:11.083 --> 09:11.417
>> ARE THEY SOLID?

09:11.484 --> 09:12.685
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.

09:12.752 --> 09:14.854
>> NO HOLLOW CHOCOLATE BUNNIES

09:14.921 --> 09:15.087
FOR ME.

09:15.154 --> 09:17.189
>> WHAT'S THE POINT OF EATING

09:17.256 --> 09:17.590
AIR?

09:17.657 --> 09:19.759
>> WHEN YOU WERE A KID THAT WAS

09:19.825 --> 09:20.126
HOLLOW.

09:20.192 --> 09:22.561
SO DISAPPOINTING.

09:22.628 --> 09:24.096
>> MUST BE SOLID CHOCOLATE.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.265
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.134
>> SOLID CHOCOLATE EASTER BUNNY.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.035
>> SOLID.

09:29.101 --> 09:30.770
>> THE ONES THAT ARE HOLLOW.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.238
>> SOME HAVE THINGS IN THEM.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.539
>> SOLID.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.708
THEY ARE HARD TO FIND.

09:35.775 --> 09:36.042
>> YEAH.

09:36.108 --> 09:39.211
>> YEAH AS A KID I FELT LIKE I

09:39.278 --> 09:40.780
WAS DENIED THE SOLID.

09:40.846 --> 09:41.047
>> HOLLOW.

09:41.113 --> 09:46.285
I WANTED TO -- THE SOLID.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.520
I'M GOING TO BUY MYSELF ONE.

09:47.586 --> 09:50.990
>> GOOD FOR YOU.

09:51.057 --> 09:51.424
>> MOVING ON.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.961
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONTAINS

09:55.027 --> 09:55.928
POLICE INTERROGATIONS.

09:55.995 --> 09:57.396
THEY ARE A STAPLE OF COUNTLESS

09:57.463 --> 09:59.999
TV SHOWS INCLUDING MIGHT NOT --

10:00.066 --> 10:01.567
ONCE YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.537
>> DID YOU KILL YOUR FATHER WITH

10:04.603 --> 10:05.037
THIS ACTS?

10:05.104 --> 10:06.706
LIE TO ME AGAIN AND I WILL

10:06.772 --> 10:07.974
ARREST YOU FOR MURDER.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.743
>> I WOULD LIKE A MINERAL WATER,

10:10.810 --> 10:11.177
NO ICE.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.512
>> I WOULD LIKE YOUR BALLS IN A

10:13.579 --> 10:14.080
BLENDER.

10:14.146 --> 10:18.584
>> YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING ME.

10:18.651 --> 10:20.753
>> CONFESS?

10:20.820 --> 10:23.322
IT'S >> HOLY SHIT.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.591
I BOW TO FUCK AFTER I GET OUT.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.526
I WAS NOT EXPECTING A CLIP FROM

10:27.593 --> 10:30.262
"MY LITTLE PONY" TO LOOK LIKE A

10:30.329 --> 10:34.500
DELETED SCENE FROM --

10:34.567 --> 10:36.135
THEY CAN RESULT IN A CONFESSION

10:36.202 --> 10:37.336
MOVING THE STORY ALONG BUT IT'S

10:37.403 --> 10:39.538
NOT JUST AUDIENCES WHO FIND THEM

10:39.605 --> 10:41.173
COMPELLING.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.041
JURIES DO TOO.

10:42.108 --> 10:43.075
CONFESSIONS ARE VIEWED AS THE

10:43.142 --> 10:44.110
GOLD STANDARD COMES WHEN

10:44.176 --> 10:46.379
INDICATOR OF GUILT AS THEY CAN

10:46.445 --> 10:47.546
APPARENTLY BE MORE PERSUASIVE

10:47.613 --> 10:49.248
THAN EVEN DNA EVIDENCE.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.917
LISTEN TO ALL THESE JURORS AND

10:51.984 --> 10:52.918
HIGH-PROFILE TRIALS EXTENDING

10:52.985 --> 10:54.720
THE EVIDENCE THAT CONVICT THEM

10:54.787 --> 10:56.355
-- CONVINCE THEM TO CONVICT.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.257
>> HE FELT NO ONE WOULD CONFESS

10:58.324 --> 10:59.658
THREE TIMES IF THEY DIDN'T DO

10:59.725 --> 10:59.825
IT.

10:59.892 --> 11:01.327
>> HE COULD HAVE CONTINUED TO

11:01.394 --> 11:02.061
DENY IT.

11:02.128 --> 11:03.329
IF YOU DID NOT HURT THAT BABY,

11:03.396 --> 11:06.065
YOU WOULD GO TO YOUR GRAVE

11:06.132 --> 11:07.133
SAYING NO I DIDN'T.

11:07.199 --> 11:08.467
>> IT WAS VERY HARD TO IMAGINE

11:08.534 --> 11:11.237
WHY ANYBODY WOULD MAKE UP

11:11.303 --> 11:13.305
SOMETHING THAT NOT ONLY

11:13.372 --> 11:16.475
INCRIMINATE THEM BUT IS FULL OF

11:16.542 --> 11:18.711
DETAILS THAT SOUND LIKE THEY

11:18.778 --> 11:19.278
ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.379
>> CONFESSIONS ARE

11:20.446 --> 11:21.580
WILDLY PERSUASIVE BECAUSE WE

11:21.647 --> 11:23.182
THINK ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT

11:23.249 --> 11:26.085
ONLY GUILTY PEOPLE DO.

11:26.152 --> 11:28.354
LIKE POSTING A APOLOGY OR

11:28.421 --> 11:30.089
REFUSING TO ANSWER ANY OF RONAN

11:30.156 --> 11:31.157
FARROW'S QUESTIONS.

11:31.223 --> 11:32.691
IN THOSE CASES, THE CONFESSION

11:32.758 --> 11:34.627
TURNED OUT TO BE FALSE.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.830
THE LAST EUROS FROM THE CASE OF

11:37.897 --> 11:39.298
THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE, THE

11:39.365 --> 11:41.133
EXONERATED FIVE.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.401
OF ALL THE CONVICTIONS WE'VE

11:42.468 --> 11:45.604
OVERTURNED THROUGH DNA TESTING

11:45.671 --> 11:46.205
29% INVOLVED FALSE CONFESSIONS

11:46.272 --> 11:46.839
AND YOU MAY FIND THAT HARD TO

11:46.906 --> 11:49.608
BELIEVE BECAUSE IT CAN BE VERY

11:49.675 --> 11:51.210
HARD TO COMPREHEND HOW SOMEONE

11:51.277 --> 11:52.912
COULD CONFESS TO SOMETHING THEY

11:52.978 --> 11:54.013
DIDN'T DO.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.114
JUST WATCH LESTER HOLT STRUGGLED

11:55.181 --> 11:56.248
TO GET HIS HEAD AROUND IT WHILE

11:56.315 --> 11:57.650
TALKING TO A JOURNALIST WHO'VE

11:57.716 --> 12:01.821
COVERED A FALSE CONFESSION CASE.

12:01.887 --> 12:02.421
>> THE MORE I INVESTIGATED IT

12:02.488 --> 12:03.122
THE MORE I CAME TO BELIEVE HE

12:03.189 --> 12:04.457
MIGHT BE TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

12:04.523 --> 12:07.626
THERE'S NOT A SHRED OF FORENSIC

12:07.693 --> 12:08.027
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.095
>> HE CONFESSED.

12:09.161 --> 12:10.896
>> LIKE MOST PEOPLE YOU CAN

12:10.963 --> 12:11.931
POSSIBLY FATHOM YOU DID

12:11.997 --> 12:13.232
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO.

12:13.299 --> 12:14.934
>> NOBODY DOES THAT.

12:15.000 --> 12:15.701
>> NOBODY WOULD THINK THEY WERE

12:15.768 --> 12:18.637
TYPICAL OF DOING UP THE TRUTH IT

12:18.704 --> 12:19.872
IS A SKILLED INTERROGATOR COULD

12:19.939 --> 12:22.141
PROBABLY GET YOU OR I TO ADMIT

12:22.208 --> 12:24.944
WE KIDNAPPED THE LINDBERGH BABY.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.512
>> A SKILLED

12:26.579 --> 12:27.146
INTERROGATOR COULD PROBABLY GET

12:27.213 --> 12:30.216
ME TO ADMIT I AM THE LINDBERGH

12:30.282 --> 12:30.983
BABY.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.919
THIS BODY TYPE IS A PHYSIQUE

12:33.986 --> 12:35.855
BEST DESCRIBED AS 92-YEAR-OLD

12:35.921 --> 12:36.255
DEAD BABY.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.023
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS AN

12:38.090 --> 12:38.891
INNOCENT PERSON MIGHT CONFESS

12:38.958 --> 12:40.359
SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T DO A LOT

12:40.426 --> 12:42.728
OF THAT COMES DOWN TO WHAT

12:42.795 --> 12:43.295
HAPPENS IN A POLICE

12:43.362 --> 12:44.864
INTERROGATION ROOM SO TONIGHT

12:44.930 --> 12:46.899
LET'S TALK ABOUT POLICE

12:46.966 --> 12:47.466
INTERROGATIONS, WHAT TACTICS

12:47.533 --> 12:49.435
THEY USE AND HOW DAMAGING THEY

12:49.502 --> 12:50.402
CAN BE PERFECTLY FOR THE

12:50.469 --> 12:51.170
INNOCENT.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.072
LET'S START WITH SOME HISTORY.

12:53.139 --> 12:55.741
IT USED TO BE POLICE COULD

12:55.808 --> 12:56.809
TORTURE PEOPLE TO GET

12:56.876 --> 12:57.743
CONFESSIONS AND PRACTICE WHAT

12:57.810 --> 12:59.778
CAME TO BE KNOWN AS USING THE

12:59.845 --> 13:02.081
THIRD DEGREE.

13:02.148 --> 13:03.382
IN 1936 THE SUPREME COURT

13:03.449 --> 13:04.483
DECLARED PHYSICAL COERCION

13:04.550 --> 13:04.884
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.018
POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD TO ADOPT

13:06.085 --> 13:07.720
NEW TECHNIQUES AND IT SAYS

13:07.786 --> 13:08.654
SOMETHING FOR THEIR EARLY

13:08.721 --> 13:10.589
ATTEMPTS TO DO THIS FEATURED

13:10.656 --> 13:11.423
SOME PRETTY BASIC INSTRUCTIONS

13:11.490 --> 13:14.393
LIKE IN THIS FILM FROM THE TEXAS

13:14.460 --> 13:15.094
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.795
>> LOOKED THE SUSPECT IN THE

13:16.862 --> 13:18.631
EYES TO OBSERVE EYE MOVEMENTS

13:18.697 --> 13:20.232
AND PHYSICAL CHANGES THAT MIGHT

13:20.299 --> 13:22.535
INDICATE DECEPTION.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.637
IF YOU CAN'T LOOK HIM IN THE

13:24.703 --> 13:26.338
EYES, WATCH AN IMAGINARY X ON

13:26.405 --> 13:27.706
THE FOREHEAD OR NOSE.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.208
IT'S THE SAME EFFECT.

13:29.275 --> 13:30.209
ONCE DECEPTION IS DETECTED YOU

13:30.276 --> 13:32.611
KNOW YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

13:32.678 --> 13:34.847
>> OKAY, HOLD ON.

13:34.914 --> 13:37.750
WAS DRYING THE X REALLY

13:37.816 --> 13:38.684
NECESSARY?

13:38.751 --> 13:39.952
THAT THEIR OFFICERS WOULD KNOW

13:40.019 --> 13:42.488
HOW TO LOOK AT HER FOR HEAD

13:42.555 --> 13:44.256
WITHOUT VISUAL REPRESENTATION?

13:44.323 --> 13:46.292
IF THEY CANNOT SPOT BEFORE HEAD,

13:46.358 --> 13:47.259
MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T BE TRUSTED

13:47.326 --> 13:48.928
TO SPOT A CRIMINAL.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.297
ONE APPROACH BECAME THE

13:51.363 --> 13:52.097
STANDARD, THE REID TECHNIQUE

13:52.164 --> 13:53.933
NAMED HER ONE OF ITS CREATORS

13:53.999 --> 13:57.903
JOHNNY REED, FORMER SHOULD CHICO

13:57.970 --> 13:59.104
POLICE OFFICER.

13:59.171 --> 14:03.375
HE FORMED THE TRAINING FIRM.

14:03.442 --> 14:06.946
IT'S INFLUENCED NEARLY NEVER

14:07.012 --> 14:10.749
1 OF THOSE THINGS THAT COMES

14:10.816 --> 14:12.851
WITH BEING A COP, THEIR FONDNESS

14:12.918 --> 14:14.220
FOR DOUGHNUTS OR COMPLICITY IN

14:14.286 --> 14:15.521
THE PERPETUATION OF

14:15.588 --> 14:16.388
STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE.

14:16.455 --> 14:17.923
WHEN IT COMES TO QUESTIONING

14:17.990 --> 14:20.492
SUSPECTS THERE ARE TWO MAJOR

14:20.559 --> 14:21.427
PHASES TO THE REID TECHNIQUE,

14:21.493 --> 14:22.928
THE INTERVIEW WHERE YOU

14:22.995 --> 14:24.496
DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE IS A

14:24.563 --> 14:25.464
SUSPECT AND THE INTERROGATION

14:25.531 --> 14:27.099
WHERE YOU TRY TO GET THEM TO

14:27.166 --> 14:28.267
CONFESS.

14:28.334 --> 14:30.035
IN THE INTERVIEW STAGE, THE GOAL

14:30.102 --> 14:31.570
IS TO GAUGE HOW TRUTHFUL THE

14:31.637 --> 14:32.838
ANSWERS ARE GETTING ARE.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.773
THE APPROACH IS SIMILAR TO A

14:34.840 --> 14:35.975
LIE DETECTOR TEST.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.209
YOU START WITH SOME BASIC

14:37.276 --> 14:38.444
QUESTIONS TO SET A BASELINE AND

14:38.510 --> 14:40.512
THEN MOVED TO THE SO-CALLED

14:40.579 --> 14:41.947
BEHAVIOR PROVOKING QUESTIONS

14:42.014 --> 14:44.016
WHEN YOU ANALYZE THE SUSPECTS

14:44.083 --> 14:46.118
VERBAL AND CRUCIALLY NONVERBAL

14:46.185 --> 14:46.452
BEHAVIOR.

14:46.518 --> 14:48.687
THIS RETRAINING FILM EXPLAINS

14:48.754 --> 14:50.256
HOW BARRIER POSTURES LIKE

14:50.322 --> 14:50.889
CROSSING YOUR ARMS ARE ASSIGNED

14:50.956 --> 14:52.958
THE AIRLINE.

14:53.025 --> 14:54.927
>> THE NEXT TWO ILLUSTRATIONS

14:54.994 --> 14:57.696
WE'RE GOING TO SEE, EACH SUBJECT

14:57.763 --> 14:59.131
MOVES INTO A BARRIER POSTURE

14:59.198 --> 14:59.732
AFTER THEY WERE ASKED THE

14:59.798 --> 15:01.700
CRITICAL QUESTION.

15:01.767 --> 15:05.304
>> WHY DO YOU THINK BOB SAID HE

15:05.371 --> 15:06.205
SAW YOU SELLING MARIJUANA?

15:06.272 --> 15:07.373
>> COME ON.

15:07.439 --> 15:08.374
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

15:08.440 --> 15:09.875
WHO KNOWS WHY PEOPLE SAY THINGS.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.111
I SURE DON'T.

15:12.177 --> 15:16.682
>> HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT

15:16.749 --> 15:19.318
SEXUALLY TOUCHING A CHILD.

15:19.385 --> 15:21.487
>> NO, NOT SERIOUSLY.

15:21.553 --> 15:22.721
>> HOLD ON.

15:22.788 --> 15:24.690
LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE ARE

15:24.757 --> 15:25.891
CLEARLY COMMUNITY THEATER ACTORS

15:25.958 --> 15:26.659
TRYING THEIR HARDEST TO CONVEY

15:26.725 --> 15:28.961
GUILT AND WE SHOULD GIVE THE

15:29.028 --> 15:30.229
FIRST ACTRESS FLOWERS BECAUSE

15:30.296 --> 15:32.097
SHE SHOWED UP TO THAT GIG READY

15:32.164 --> 15:32.898
TO WORK.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.834
AS FOR THIS GUY, HE TOOK A

15:35.901 --> 15:37.403
PRETTY SPOT ON KEVIN SPACEY

15:37.469 --> 15:38.504
IMPRESSION BETWEEN THE FACIAL

15:38.570 --> 15:40.072
RESEMBLANCE, THE HAIRCUT AND THE

15:40.139 --> 15:41.874
DENIALS OF ATTRACTION TO

15:41.940 --> 15:42.141
CHILDREN.

15:42.207 --> 15:43.809
HE IS REALLY NAILING IT AND I

15:43.876 --> 15:46.078
KNOW THAT LOOKS DATED BUT IT'S

15:46.145 --> 15:50.182
IN USE AND THAT VIDEO IS

15:50.249 --> 15:51.750
AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE.

15:51.817 --> 15:53.285
IT WAS $100 AND IT WAS NOT

15:53.352 --> 15:55.721
REMOTELY WORTH IT.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.356
BUT THERE'S A BIG ISSUE WITH

15:57.423 --> 16:00.225
RELYING ON THAT SORT OF

16:00.292 --> 16:01.427
BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS BECAUSE

16:01.493 --> 16:02.895
WHILE REID CLAIMS INVESTIGATORS

16:02.961 --> 16:03.629
TRAINED IN THEIR TECHNIQUE HAVE

16:03.696 --> 16:06.498
SHOWN AN AVERAGE ACCURACY OF 83%

16:06.565 --> 16:07.733
AND IDENTIFYING DECEPTIVE

16:07.800 --> 16:10.202
SUBJECTS, THE TRUTH IS MUCH LESS

16:10.269 --> 16:11.670
IMPRESSIVE IS THIS RETIRED

16:11.737 --> 16:13.872
HOMICIDE INVESTOR EXPLAINS.

16:13.939 --> 16:15.574
>> THE REID PEOPLE ADMIT IT'S

16:15.641 --> 16:16.875
NOT BASED ON ANY SCIENCE

16:16.942 --> 16:19.044
WHATSOEVER, IT'S BASED ON THEIR

16:19.111 --> 16:20.179
OWN OBSERVATIONS.

16:20.245 --> 16:21.880
THE REAL SCIENCE SAYS IT'S

16:21.947 --> 16:22.114
BALONEY.

16:22.181 --> 16:26.051
IT DOESN'T WORK.

16:26.118 --> 16:27.386
AND WHEN THEY HAVE DONE

16:27.453 --> 16:29.455
EXPERIMENTS WITH IT, THEY PRETTY

16:29.521 --> 16:32.491
MUCH SHOW THAT THE ACCURACY IS

16:32.558 --> 16:34.493
LIKE FLIPPING A COIN.

16:34.560 --> 16:34.960
IT'S 50/50.

16:35.027 --> 16:37.363
>> RIGHT.

16:37.429 --> 16:38.630
IT'S BASICALLY CHANCE.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.799
AROUND THE SAME ACCURACY IS A

16:40.866 --> 16:43.035
BUZZFEED QUIZ.

16:43.102 --> 16:46.271
ALSO 17 QUESTIONS -- ANSWER 17

16:46.338 --> 16:49.141
QUESTIONS.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.542
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING

16:50.609 --> 16:54.947
ABOUT, BUZZFEED?

16:55.013 --> 16:58.317
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, REID AND

16:58.384 --> 16:59.084
ASSOCIATES WILL INSIST.

16:59.151 --> 17:00.486
INTERVIEW TECHNIQUE IS PART OF

17:00.552 --> 17:01.787
AN OVERALL APPROACH THAT WORKS

17:01.854 --> 17:03.922
IF YOU JUST FOLLOW ALL THE

17:03.989 --> 17:05.858
INSTRUCTIONS AND THEIR 400 PAGE

17:05.924 --> 17:07.760
MANUAL TO THE LETTER BUT THIS

17:07.826 --> 17:10.062
THING IS SO FULL OF CAVEATS AND

17:10.129 --> 17:11.063
OUTRIGHT CONTRADICTIONS YOU CAN

17:11.130 --> 17:12.631
FIND SUPPORT IN IT WITH NEARLY

17:12.698 --> 17:14.400
ANY CONCLUSION THAT YOU WANT TO

17:14.466 --> 17:15.234
REACH.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.136
WHEN IT COMES TO MY CONTACT, IT

17:17.202 --> 17:18.904
ADVISES THAT WHEN A PERSON IS

17:18.971 --> 17:21.206
BEING LESS THAN HONEST HE MAY

17:21.273 --> 17:23.375
NOT MAINTAIN DIRECT EYE CONTACT

17:23.442 --> 17:25.110
BUT ALSO OTHERS MAY

17:25.177 --> 17:26.178
OVERCOMPENSATE BY STARING

17:26.245 --> 17:29.281
MEANING IF YOU HAVE IDEAS,

17:29.348 --> 17:31.150
YOU'RE BASICALLY FUCKED AND I'M

17:31.216 --> 17:32.584
NOT SAYING THAT REID IS THE ONLY

17:32.651 --> 17:33.018
PROBLEM.

17:33.085 --> 17:35.320
THERE'S A WHOLE INDUSTRY OF

17:35.387 --> 17:36.188
CONSULTANTS WHO SUPPOSEDLY TRAIN

17:36.255 --> 17:41.560
COPS TO SPOT LIARS BUT IT'S ALL

17:41.627 --> 17:43.896
BULLSHIT.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.531
BEHAVIORAL CUES ARE SIMPLY NOT

17:45.597 --> 17:47.699
RELIABLE INDICATORS OF DECEPTION

17:47.766 --> 17:48.700
WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.969
PEOPLE MOVE THEIR BODIES IN ALL

17:51.036 --> 17:52.037
SORTS OF WAYS WHEN THEY ARE

17:52.104 --> 17:54.339
TELLING THE TRUTH OR NOT.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.408
THE ONLY TRULY HONEST BODY

17:56.475 --> 17:57.743
MOVEMENT HUMANS ARE CAPABLE OF

17:57.810 --> 17:58.544
IS WHEN SOMEONE ACCIDENTALLY

17:58.610 --> 18:00.879
WALKS THROUGH A SPIDER WEB.

18:00.946 --> 18:01.947
THAT'S IT.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.649
THEN AND ONLY THEN ARE YOUR

18:03.715 --> 18:05.918
GESTURES COMPLETELY TRUTHFUL AND

18:05.984 --> 18:08.487
VOID OF --

18:08.554 --> 18:11.356
FUCKING SHIT.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.891
THANKS TO THE JUNK SCIENCE

18:12.958 --> 18:14.393
POLICE CAN ASSURE THEMSELVES OF

18:14.460 --> 18:15.127
THEIR OWN CERTAINTIES AND IF

18:15.194 --> 18:17.095
THEY HAVE DECIDED YOU'RE GUILTY,

18:17.162 --> 18:19.097
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE BECAUSE

18:19.164 --> 18:20.165
THAT'S WHEN THE INTERROGATION

18:20.232 --> 18:21.700
BEGINS AND WHILE THEY WILL SAY

18:21.767 --> 18:24.203
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THE TRUTH,

18:24.269 --> 18:25.070
REID TRAINS OFFICERS TO STEER

18:25.137 --> 18:26.705
THE CONVERSATION AWAY FROM

18:26.772 --> 18:28.340
ANYTHING THAT'S NOT A

18:28.407 --> 18:28.740
CONFESSION.

18:28.807 --> 18:30.943
>> MANY GUILTY PEOPLE INTRODUCE

18:31.009 --> 18:31.543
THEIR DENIALS WITH PERMISSION

18:31.610 --> 18:34.046
PHRASES SUCH AS CAN I SAY ONE

18:34.112 --> 18:35.347
THING?

18:35.414 --> 18:36.815
WHICH IS -- WOULD YOU LISTEN TO

18:36.882 --> 18:37.649
ME?

18:37.716 --> 18:39.751
IF I CAN ONLY EXPLAIN.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.053
WHEN THE INTERROGATOR HEARS

18:41.119 --> 18:42.921
THOSE PHRASE IT'S IMPORTANT TO

18:42.988 --> 18:44.656
INTERJECT YOURSELF AND STOP A

18:44.723 --> 18:46.058
PERSON FROM CONTINUING BECAUSE

18:46.125 --> 18:48.494
IF YOU LET HIM TALK, THEY WILL

18:48.560 --> 18:50.429
SEE THE WORDS "I DIDN'T DO IT."

18:50.496 --> 18:51.530
THE MORE OFTEN A PERSON SAYS

18:51.597 --> 18:53.031
THEY DIDN'T DO IT, THE MORE

18:53.098 --> 18:55.133
DIFFICULT IT BECOMES FOR US TO

18:55.200 --> 18:55.801
GET A CONFESSION.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.403
>> OH, YES, THE TELLTALE

18:58.470 --> 18:59.338
SIGNS OF GUILT.

18:59.404 --> 19:01.540
WOULD YOU PLEASE LISTEN TO ME?

19:01.607 --> 19:01.940
CAN I EXPLAIN?

19:02.007 --> 19:04.009
AND I'M TELLING YOU I DIDN'T DO

19:04.076 --> 19:04.243
IT.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.345
IF AN INVESTIGATOR IS TRYING TO

19:06.411 --> 19:07.946
GET YOU TO CONFESS, THEY CAN

19:08.013 --> 19:09.114
GRIND YOU DOWN.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.716
INTERROGATIONS CAN LAST FROM A

19:10.782 --> 19:12.217
COUPLE HOURS TO DOUBLE DIGITS.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.151
ONE STUDY OF FALSE CONFESSIONS

19:13.218 --> 19:16.555
FOUND THEY CAME AFTER AN AVERAGE

19:16.622 --> 19:18.557
OF 16.3 HOURS OF QUESTIONING

19:18.624 --> 19:20.092
WHICH CAN BE UTTERLY EXHAUSTING.

19:20.158 --> 19:22.060
INNOCENT PEOPLE CAN WIND UP

19:22.127 --> 19:23.729
CONFESSING JUST TO ESCAPE THE

19:23.795 --> 19:24.329
STRESS OF THAT SITUATION.

19:24.396 --> 19:27.399
THAT WAS THE CASE WITH ROBERT

19:27.466 --> 19:29.368
DAVIS WHO WAS SUSPECTED OF

19:29.434 --> 19:30.135
DOUBLE MURDER AND INTERROGATED

19:30.202 --> 19:34.907
FOR OVER FIVE HOURS.

19:34.973 --> 19:40.145
>> TO GET ME OUT OF THIS.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.948
WILL I GO HOME?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.349
>> I CAN'T PROMISE YOU.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.051
YOU WORK WITH ME AND I'LL DO

19:46.118 --> 19:47.920
EVERYTHING I CAN THAT WE CAN

19:47.986 --> 19:54.092
MAYBE GET YOU HOME CARE ROBERT.

19:54.159 --> 19:55.227
SINCE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL

19:55.294 --> 19:56.094
ME.

19:56.161 --> 19:58.063
YOU STABBED THAT WOMAN.

19:58.130 --> 20:01.633
YOU STABBED HER, DIDN'T YOU?

20:01.700 --> 20:03.302
>> DO YOU THINK BY ME TELLING

20:03.368 --> 20:06.438
YOU THIS I CAN GET HOME TODAY.

20:06.505 --> 20:08.640
WHY AM I LYING ABOUT THIS JUST

20:08.707 --> 20:14.346
SO I CAN GO HOME?

20:14.413 --> 20:16.014
I AM LYING TO YOU.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.282
>> YEAH, HE LIED ABOUT

20:17.349 --> 20:19.818
STABBING SOMEONE AND THEN

20:19.885 --> 20:20.586
IMMEDIATELY ADMITTED HE LIED BUT

20:20.652 --> 20:22.921
BY THAT POINT IT WAS TOO LATE.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.924
HE WENT TO PRISON FOR 13 YEARS

20:25.991 --> 20:27.092
BEFORE BEING EXONERATED.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.760
THE NOTION THAT PEOPLE CRACK

20:28.827 --> 20:29.928
UNDER PRESSURE AND FALSELY

20:29.995 --> 20:31.330
CONFESS REALLY SHOULDN'T BE THAT

20:31.396 --> 20:32.197
HARD TO UNDERSTAND.

20:32.264 --> 20:34.499
IT'S A CONCEPT THAT EVEN

20:34.566 --> 20:35.467
CHILDREN'S CARTOONS GET BECAUSE

20:35.534 --> 20:37.336
REMEMBER THAT "MY LITTLE PONY"

20:37.402 --> 20:37.836
SCENE?

20:37.903 --> 20:40.138
THIS IS HOW IT CONTINUED.

20:40.205 --> 20:43.208
>> NO, NO, NO, NO!

20:43.275 --> 20:44.676
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?

20:44.743 --> 20:46.812
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY

20:46.878 --> 20:47.846
AND I'LL SAY IT.

20:47.913 --> 20:48.714
>> TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT

20:48.780 --> 20:50.248
ME TO SAY AND I'LL SAY IT.

20:50.315 --> 20:51.550
I KIDNAPPED THE LINDBERGH BABY.

20:51.617 --> 20:54.519
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR,

20:54.586 --> 20:55.187
YOU PINK PSYCHO?

20:55.253 --> 20:56.154
PEOPLE MIGHT ASSUME THAT EVEN IF

20:56.221 --> 20:57.456
THEY FALSELY CONFESS THEY CAN

20:57.522 --> 20:59.124
LATER RECANT IN THE REAL

20:59.191 --> 21:00.659
EVIDENCE WILL PREVAIL AND CLEAR

21:00.726 --> 21:02.794
THEM BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY

21:02.861 --> 21:04.730
UNLIKELY BECAUSE AS SOON AS THE

21:04.796 --> 21:06.031
POLICE GET A CONFESSION,

21:06.098 --> 21:07.733
THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS TIME TO

21:07.799 --> 21:08.367
STOP AT THIS POINT GOING TO

21:08.433 --> 21:09.601
ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU MAY HAVE

21:09.668 --> 21:11.236
HAD FOR A WHILE NOW.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.171
WHY DON'T PEOPLE JUST INVOKE

21:13.238 --> 21:14.506
THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AN

21:14.573 --> 21:16.041
ATTORNEY?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.576
THE TRUTH IS APPROXIMATELY 80%

21:17.643 --> 21:19.845
WAY OF THEIR MIRANDA RIGHTS AND

21:19.911 --> 21:21.780
WILLINGLY SUBMIT TO A POLICE

21:21.847 --> 21:23.148
INTERROGATION FOR A NUMBER OF

21:23.215 --> 21:24.483
UNDERSTANDABLE REASONS.

21:24.549 --> 21:25.250
SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK I DON'T

21:25.317 --> 21:26.018
NEED A LAWYER.

21:26.084 --> 21:27.019
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

21:27.085 --> 21:28.587
OR THEY BELIEVE THEIR ONLY BEING

21:28.654 --> 21:30.489
BROUGHT IN AS A WITNESS AND NOT

21:30.555 --> 21:31.456
A SUSPECT.

21:31.523 --> 21:33.291
HAVING A LAWYER MAKES YOU

21:33.358 --> 21:34.192
INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE -- NOT

21:34.259 --> 21:35.427
HAVING A LAWYER.

21:35.494 --> 21:39.698
A LAWYER MICHAEL YOU INTO AN

21:39.765 --> 21:41.500
ABSOLUTELY INSANE POWER THE

21:41.566 --> 21:42.067
POLICE IN AMERICA HAVE BEEN

21:42.134 --> 21:44.169
GIVEN BY THE SERENE CARD.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.738
>> A DETECTIVE CAN LEGALLY LIE

21:46.805 --> 21:49.908
ABOUT THE EVIDENCE TO A SUSPECT.

21:49.975 --> 21:50.809
IT IS LAWFUL FOR DETECTIVE TO

21:50.876 --> 21:51.877
TURN TO A SUSPECT AND SAY YOU

21:51.943 --> 21:54.012
DIDN'T DO THIS BUT WE HAVE GOT

21:54.079 --> 21:55.847
YOUR FINGERPRINTS ON THE MURDER

21:55.914 --> 21:56.481
WEAPON.

21:56.548 --> 21:59.418
OR WE HAVE A VICTIM WHO HAD HAIR

21:59.484 --> 22:01.119
IN HER GRASP AND WE TESTED THE

22:01.186 --> 22:01.420
HAIR.

22:01.486 --> 22:02.187
IT'S YOURS.

22:02.254 --> 22:04.489
OR THE SHOE PRINTS WE FOUND AT

22:04.556 --> 22:06.591
THE SCENE ARE YOURS OR THE

22:06.658 --> 22:08.293
POLYGRAPH YOU WANTED TO TAKE,

22:08.360 --> 22:09.294
YOU FAILED IT.

22:09.361 --> 22:10.195
>> IT'S TRUE.

22:10.262 --> 22:11.563
THE POLICE IN THIS COUNTRY CAN

22:11.630 --> 22:13.999
FLAT OUT LIE TO YOU TO MAKE YOU

22:14.066 --> 22:14.933
THINK YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO

22:15.000 --> 22:17.302
CONFESS AND SOME OF THE LIES

22:17.369 --> 22:18.737
THEY TELL ARE SIMPLY RIDICULOUS.

22:18.804 --> 22:20.305
AN INVESTIGATOR IN FLORIDA TOLD

22:20.372 --> 22:23.709
A SUSPECT THEY HAD A LASER, THE

22:23.775 --> 22:27.312
KIND THAT YOU SHOOT ON

22:27.379 --> 22:30.148
"STAR WARS" AND THEY COULD LIFT

22:30.215 --> 22:30.782
FINGERPRINTS.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.250
TECHNOLOGY THAT DOES NOT EXIST.

22:32.317 --> 22:34.820
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE WE ARE ONE

22:34.886 --> 22:37.556
BAD PITCH MEETING AWAY FROM THE

22:37.622 --> 22:39.424
"STAR WARS" LASER GETTING ITS

22:39.491 --> 22:42.027
OWN TEN EPISODE SERIES ON DISNEY

22:42.094 --> 22:44.863
PLUS.

22:44.930 --> 22:47.499
ALLOWING THE POLICE TO LYING TO

22:47.566 --> 22:48.967
SUSPECTS IS CRAZY.

22:49.034 --> 22:49.935
MOST COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW IT

22:50.001 --> 22:51.336
AND FOR GOOD REASON.

22:51.403 --> 22:54.473
IT IS FAR TOO POWERFUL A TOOL.

22:54.539 --> 22:54.940
ROBERT DAVIS.

22:55.006 --> 22:56.508
IT MIGHT STILL BE HARD FOR YOU

22:56.575 --> 22:58.376
TO IMAGINE WHAT HE CONFESSED TO

22:58.443 --> 22:59.311
DOING SOMETHING THAT HE DIDN'T

22:59.377 --> 23:01.279
DO BUT LOOK AT WHAT THE

23:01.346 --> 23:02.581
INTERROGATOR WAS CLAIMING IN

23:02.647 --> 23:06.985
THAT ROOM.

23:07.052 --> 23:14.126
>>

23:14.192 --> 23:16.595
>> IF YOU DON'T TALK TO ME, I

23:16.661 --> 23:19.631
CAN'T KEEP YOU FROM THE WORST.

23:19.698 --> 23:20.665
YOU WERE THERE.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.501
IT SHOWS YOU WHERE THERE.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.169
THE EVIDENCE SHOWS IT.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.737
I CAN'T LIE ABOUT THE EVIDENCE.

23:25.804 --> 23:28.273
>> I CAN'T LIE ABOUT THE

23:28.340 --> 23:28.540
EVIDENCE?

23:28.607 --> 23:30.742
HE LIED AS HE LIED ABOUT THE

23:30.809 --> 23:33.145
EVIDENCE AND DID IT GESTURING

23:33.211 --> 23:34.279
WITH ALL THE THEATRICAL NUANCE

23:34.346 --> 23:35.480
OF A HIGH SCHOOLER AUDITIONING

23:35.547 --> 23:37.516
FOR "A FEW GOOD MEN."

23:37.582 --> 23:38.950
THE OVERWHELMING PRESSURE OF A

23:39.017 --> 23:40.118
POLICE INTERROGATION COUPLED

23:40.185 --> 23:42.120
WITH THEIR ABILITY TO INVENT

23:42.187 --> 23:43.321
EVIDENCE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE

23:43.388 --> 23:44.756
QUESTION THEIR OWN MEMORIES.

23:44.823 --> 23:46.091
THAT HAPPENED WITH CHRISTOPHER

23:46.158 --> 23:47.159
TAPP WHO SERVED 20 YEARS IN

23:47.225 --> 23:49.594
PRISON FOR A MURDER HE DID NOT

23:49.661 --> 23:52.631
COMMIT AND WAS HEAVILY

23:52.697 --> 23:53.965
MANIPULATED DURING HIS

23:54.032 --> 23:54.299
INTERROGATION.

23:54.366 --> 23:57.469
>> I WASN'T THERE.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.671
>> THE POLICE TOLD ME A FEW

23:59.738 --> 24:01.139
TIMES IF THERE WAS SOMETHING

24:01.206 --> 24:01.973
THAT HORRIFIC, YOU WOULD

24:02.040 --> 24:02.941
DEFINITELY HIDE IT AND IT WOULD

24:03.008 --> 24:04.009
GO IN YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS.

24:04.075 --> 24:06.545
>> IT'S LIKE ME.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.914
THE STUFF THAT WE SEE OUT ON THE

24:08.980 --> 24:09.848
STREETS, MY MIND SHUTS DOWN ON

24:09.915 --> 24:12.150
ME BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

24:12.217 --> 24:12.918
REMEMBER IT.

24:12.984 --> 24:14.119
>> I STARTED SECOND-GUESSING

24:14.186 --> 24:15.453
MYSELF DURING ALL OF THIS.

24:15.520 --> 24:16.721
I STARTED TO NOT BELIEVE IN

24:16.788 --> 24:17.756
MYSELF OR WHO I WAS.

24:17.823 --> 24:19.224
>> I DON'T KNOW.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.059
RIGHT NOW EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN

24:21.126 --> 24:22.060
SAYING, WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT IN

24:22.127 --> 24:23.695
MY HEAD, IT'S BEEN WRONG.

24:23.762 --> 24:25.130
>> THAT IS TERRIBLE AND

24:25.197 --> 24:26.865
IT'S MORE THAN A LITTLE

24:26.932 --> 24:27.365
INFURIATING HOW THAT

24:27.432 --> 24:28.300
INVESTIGATOR CONVINCES HIM OF

24:28.366 --> 24:29.367
DOUBTING HIS OWN MEMORY BY

24:29.434 --> 24:30.936
MAKING IT SEEM LIKE IT HAPPENS

24:31.002 --> 24:31.469
ALL THE TIME.

24:31.536 --> 24:33.171
YOU HAVE TO EXPECT THEM TO SAY

24:33.238 --> 24:34.306
YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN REMEMBER

24:34.372 --> 24:38.410
THAT IT WAS BERNSTEIN BEARS OR

24:38.476 --> 24:42.547
BERNSTEIN BEARS OR IF SHAQ WAS

24:42.614 --> 24:45.150
IN A MOVIE OR MAYBE IT WAS

24:45.217 --> 24:45.884
SINBAD.

24:45.951 --> 24:46.885
THAT'S WHAT YOUR BRAIN IS DOING

24:46.952 --> 24:49.321
RIGHT NOW BUT WITH MURDER.

24:49.387 --> 24:50.722
BRAINS ARE WEIRD.

24:50.789 --> 24:51.323
THESE TACTICS ARE INCREDIBLY

24:51.389 --> 24:51.990
MANIPULATIVE AND THEY WORK

24:52.057 --> 24:54.025
ESPECIALLY WELL ON CERTAIN

24:54.092 --> 24:54.259
PEOPLE.

24:54.326 --> 24:54.893
RESEARCH SHOWS FALSE CONVERTERS

24:54.960 --> 24:59.664
WERE A FACTOR IN 34% OF CASES IY

24:59.731 --> 25:02.267
CONVICTED AND 69% OF CASES IN

25:02.334 --> 25:03.668
WHICH PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS

25:03.735 --> 25:04.769
OR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES

25:04.836 --> 25:06.905
WERE LATER EXONERATED AND

25:06.972 --> 25:08.106
LOOKED, THERE ARE SOME LIMITS ON

25:08.173 --> 25:09.908
WHAT POLICE CAN DO.

25:09.975 --> 25:10.876
SOME JUDGES WON'T ALLOW A

25:10.942 --> 25:13.645
CONFESSION OF THE POLICE PROMISE

25:13.712 --> 25:15.914
LENIENCY IN EXCHANGE FOR IT BUT

25:15.981 --> 25:17.549
MANY COPS WALK RIGHT UP TO THAT

25:17.616 --> 25:19.718
LINE BY SUGGESTING A CONFESSION

25:19.784 --> 25:21.019
MIGHT USE PRISON TIME OR SPARE

25:21.086 --> 25:22.287
YOU THE DEATH PENALTY.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.822
YOU SAW THAT HAPPEN WITH ROBERT

25:23.889 --> 25:25.523
DAVIS WHEN AN OFFICER TOLD HIM

25:25.590 --> 25:27.292
HE COULD KEEP HIM FROM THE

25:27.359 --> 25:28.393
WORST.

25:28.460 --> 25:29.594
ALSO POLICE ARE TOLD NOT TO FEED

25:29.661 --> 25:31.129
YOU INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRIME

25:31.196 --> 25:33.398
THAT IS NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

25:33.465 --> 25:34.499
BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY FOR A

25:34.566 --> 25:36.001
JURY TO HEAR THAT YOU KNEW

25:36.067 --> 25:37.502
DETAILS ONLY THE GUILTY PARTY

25:37.569 --> 25:38.904
WOULD KNOW BUT THAT HAPPENS ALL

25:38.970 --> 25:44.342
THE TIME TOO.

25:44.409 --> 25:45.911
EXONERATIONS, 94% OF FALSE

25:45.977 --> 25:46.945
CONFESSIONS WERE CONTENDED BY

25:47.012 --> 25:49.648
ALLEGEDLY INSIDE INFORMATION.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.483
EVEN IF POLICE ENGAGE IN THESE

25:51.549 --> 25:53.952
TACTICS, CRUCIALLY THE JURY MAY

25:54.019 --> 25:55.720
ONLY SEE THE CONFESSION, NOT THE

25:55.787 --> 25:58.990
INTERROGATION THAT LED UP TO IT,

25:59.057 --> 25:59.991
ONLY 30 STATES REQUIRE THE

26:00.058 --> 26:01.026
RECORDING OF INTERROGATIONS AT

26:01.092 --> 26:02.928
ALL AND IN THE REST IT'S UP TO

26:02.994 --> 26:04.829
THE POLICE WHO MIGHT ONLY RECORD

26:04.896 --> 26:05.463
THE CONFESSION.

26:05.530 --> 26:07.032
THAT'S IT.

26:07.098 --> 26:10.068
YOU JUST CANNOT GET THE FULL

26:10.135 --> 26:11.736
STORY FROM SEEING ONE SHORT

26:11.803 --> 26:11.937
CLIP.

26:12.003 --> 26:12.537
IMAGINE IF THE ONLY CLIP THAT

26:12.604 --> 26:15.540
YOU HAD EVER SEEN OF THE SHOW

26:15.607 --> 26:16.841
""ONE TREE HILL"" WAS THIS.

26:16.908 --> 26:22.247
>> CALL EXTENSION.

26:22.314 --> 26:27.385
DR. CASPER TO CPR.

26:27.452 --> 26:44.836
NURSE HENDERSON.

26:44.903 --> 26:47.005
>> DO YOU WANT TO KNOW

26:47.072 --> 26:47.739
WHAT "ONE TREE HILL" IS ABOUT?

26:47.806 --> 26:49.274
IT'S ABOUT A HIGH SCHOOL

26:49.341 --> 26:49.674
BASKETBALL TEAM.

26:49.741 --> 26:50.875
YOU'D HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING

26:50.942 --> 26:51.376
THAT FROM THAT CLIP.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.311
ALL YOU WOULD KNOW WAS THAT

26:53.378 --> 26:55.246
CONTAIN THE MOST PERFECT 20

26:55.313 --> 26:55.880
SECONDS OF TELEVISION THAT HAS

26:55.947 --> 26:58.416
EVER EXISTED.

26:58.483 --> 26:59.284
THE PROBLEM WITH POLICE

26:59.351 --> 26:59.918
INTERROGATIONS RIGHT NOW IS THE

26:59.985 --> 27:03.021
SAME PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH

27:03.088 --> 27:03.788
POLICING AT LARGE.

27:03.855 --> 27:05.123
THEY ARE BULLDOZED TO ACT

27:05.190 --> 27:05.690
HOWEVER THEY WOULD LIKE IN A

27:05.757 --> 27:07.559
SYSTEM WHERE THEY HOLD AN UNDUE

27:07.625 --> 27:09.995
AMOUNT OF POWER WITH VERY FEW

27:10.061 --> 27:10.996
PROTECTIONS FOR CIVILIANS

27:11.062 --> 27:12.330
ESPECIALLY THE MOST VULNERABLE

27:12.397 --> 27:14.065
BECAUSE THEY CAN BE LITTLE TO NO

27:14.132 --> 27:15.500
CONSEQUENCES FOR EXTRACTING A

27:15.567 --> 27:17.135
FULL CONFESSION.

27:17.202 --> 27:18.970
LISTEN TO THIS MAN, A

27:19.037 --> 27:20.505
19-YEAR-OLD FORMER SPECIAL

27:20.572 --> 27:21.239
EDUCATION STUDENT.

27:21.306 --> 27:25.710
AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST FOR

27:25.777 --> 27:27.445
RAPING AND MURDERING A WOMAN.

27:27.512 --> 27:29.681
INTERROGATING OVER FOUR DAYS AND

27:29.748 --> 27:32.784
TWO POLYGRAPHS, HE CONFESSED

27:32.851 --> 27:34.919
UNDER PRESSURE AND SPENT NEARLY

27:34.986 --> 27:36.121
20 YEARS IN PRISON UNTIL FINALLY

27:36.187 --> 27:38.656
BEING EXONERATED BY DNA.

27:38.723 --> 27:40.358
>> ALL OF THE OFFICERS THAT

27:40.425 --> 27:45.430
WORKED ON MY CASE, THE OF ALL

27:45.497 --> 27:47.732
RETIRED WITH A PENSION, A FULL

27:47.799 --> 27:49.067
PENSION, NO REPERCUSSION, NO

27:49.134 --> 27:49.601
RETRIBUTION, NO CRIMINAL

27:49.667 --> 27:51.369
CHARGES.

27:51.436 --> 27:53.905
NOTHING.

27:53.972 --> 27:56.274
THEY EXCEEDED IN THEIR JOB.

27:56.341 --> 27:58.977
THEY RETIRED AS CAPTAINS,

27:59.044 --> 28:01.713
MAJORS, LIEUTENANTS.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.882
THEY GAVE HIM A PLAQUE FOR A

28:03.948 --> 28:04.182
GOOD JOB.

28:04.249 --> 28:06.684
>> THAT IS MADDENING.

28:06.751 --> 28:08.219
THAT STATE ATTORNEY CERTAINLY

28:08.286 --> 28:08.887
DOESN'T DESERVE A GOOD JOB

28:08.953 --> 28:11.356
PLAQUE UNLESS IT CAME WITH

28:11.423 --> 28:15.693
ANOTHER THAT READ "AT FUCKING UP

28:15.760 --> 28:17.595
INNOCENT PEOPLE'S LIVES, YOUR

28:17.662 --> 28:18.930
MONUMENTAL ASSHOLE."

28:18.997 --> 28:22.067
PEOPLE WHO WERE EXONERATED, MANY

28:22.133 --> 28:23.501
ARE INCARCERATED FIGHTING

28:23.568 --> 28:25.070
CONVICTIONS THAT HAVE EVERY

28:25.136 --> 28:26.337
HALLMARK OF A FALSE CONFESSION

28:26.404 --> 28:30.041
LIKE BRANDON DESSIE WHO WAS 16

28:30.108 --> 28:32.310
WHEN HE CONFESSED TO A MURDER HE

28:32.377 --> 28:33.011
COULD NOT DESCRIBE.

28:33.078 --> 28:36.347
MELISSA, WHOSE INCREDIBLY

28:36.414 --> 28:37.816
MANIPULATIVE INTERROGATION WE

28:37.882 --> 28:38.716
FEATURED IN OUR WRONGFUL

28:38.783 --> 28:39.818
CONVICTIONS BEESON WAS SENT TO

28:39.884 --> 28:41.719
BE EXECUTED IN TEN DAYS.

28:41.786 --> 28:45.223
WHAT CAN WE DO.

28:45.290 --> 28:46.891
WE SHOULD REQUIRE ALL

28:46.958 --> 28:48.526
INTERROGATIONS BE RECORDED IN

28:48.593 --> 28:49.294
THEIR ENTIRETY SURGERIES HAVE

28:49.360 --> 28:50.528
THE FULL CONTEXT OF WHAT

28:50.595 --> 28:51.963
HAPPENED IN THAT ROOM.

28:52.030 --> 28:53.998
WE SHOULD ALSO MAKE IT ILLEGAL

28:54.065 --> 28:56.835
FOR POLICE TO LIE TO SUSPECTS

28:56.901 --> 28:57.769
BECAUSE IT IS MADNESS THEY ARE

28:57.836 --> 29:00.438
CURRENTLY ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

29:00.505 --> 29:01.372
THERE'S ACTUALLY A GROWING

29:01.439 --> 29:03.108
MOVEMENT FOR SUMMARY FORM.

29:03.174 --> 29:04.843
THESE THREE STATES HAVE BANNED

29:04.909 --> 29:06.845
POLICE FROM LYING TO JUVENILE

29:06.911 --> 29:07.412
SUSPECTS.

29:07.479 --> 29:08.913
NEW YORK HAS INTRODUCED

29:08.980 --> 29:10.915
LEGISLATION WOULD BAN LYING TO

29:10.982 --> 29:14.352
ALL SUSPECTS AND REQUIRE THE

29:14.419 --> 29:16.888
RELIABILITY OF EVIDENCE BEFORE

29:16.955 --> 29:17.522
ALLOWED TO BE USED.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.058
IT SHOULD BE ADOPTED EVERYWHERE.

29:20.125 --> 29:21.326
IF YOU'RE THINKING HOLD ON, HOW

29:21.392 --> 29:22.527
WILL INVESTIGATORS GET GUILTY

29:22.594 --> 29:23.895
PEOPLE TO CONFESS IF THEY CAN'T

29:23.962 --> 29:26.264
INTIMIDATE OR LIED TO THEM?

29:26.331 --> 29:34.172
NOT TO BE A TOTAL BITCH BUT

29:34.239 --> 29:35.106
THEIR JOB IS LITERALLY TO

29:35.173 --> 29:35.874
INVESTIGATE SOME OF IT THEY CAN

29:35.940 --> 29:37.675
DO SOME OF THAT.

29:37.742 --> 29:38.943
YOU CAN PRODUCTIVELY INTERROGATE

29:39.010 --> 29:39.777
SOMEONE WITHOUT LYING TO THEM.

29:39.844 --> 29:41.646
THE U.K.'S AT SOMETHING LIKE THE

29:41.713 --> 29:43.681
PIECE METHOD WHERE THEY ASK

29:43.748 --> 29:45.250
OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS AND LET THE

29:45.316 --> 29:46.117
SUSPECT GIVE THEIR OWN

29:46.184 --> 29:48.786
ACCOUNT AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT

29:48.853 --> 29:49.854
SYSTEM IS PERFECT.

29:49.921 --> 29:50.788
IT CLEARLY ISN'T, AMONG OTHER

29:50.855 --> 29:52.590
THINGS THEY STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN

29:52.657 --> 29:55.226
THE QUEEN TO CONFESS TO KILLING

29:55.293 --> 29:56.861
DIANA ON CAMERA BUT IT'S AT

29:56.928 --> 29:57.962
LEAST A START.

29:58.029 --> 29:59.898
IN THE MEANTIME, THERE'S

29:59.964 --> 30:01.699
ACTUALLY A LOT OF CULTURAL

30:01.766 --> 30:02.300
CONDITIONING REGARDING POLICE

30:02.367 --> 30:03.334
INTERROGATIONS THAT WE NEED TO

30:03.401 --> 30:05.036
START UNDOING BECAUSE THINK

30:05.103 --> 30:05.503
ABOUT IT.

30:05.570 --> 30:07.805
HOW MANY DRAMAS HAVE YOU SEEN ON

30:07.872 --> 30:09.674
TV WHERE ROUGHING UP THE BAD GUY

30:09.741 --> 30:10.975
LED TO SOLVING THE CRIME.

30:11.042 --> 30:12.844
HOW MANY SHOWS HAVE THERE BEEN

30:12.911 --> 30:15.113
WHERE THE BAD GUY SEEMED GUILTY

30:15.180 --> 30:17.115
AND THE OFFICERS GUT FEELING WAS

30:17.182 --> 30:19.617
CONFIRMED BY THE END OF THE

30:19.684 --> 30:19.851
EPISODE?

30:19.918 --> 30:21.252
OUR MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT POLICE

30:21.319 --> 30:21.786
INTERROGATIONS HAVE BEEN

30:21.853 --> 30:23.955
HAMMERED IN BY CRIME DRAMAS AND

30:24.022 --> 30:25.423
THEY BEEN HAMMERED IN DEEP.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.725
PERHAPS ONE SMALL WAY TO HELP

30:27.792 --> 30:29.627
UNDO THAT DAMAGE IS FOR SHOWS TO

30:29.694 --> 30:31.429
PRESENT A SLIGHTLY MORE ACCURATE

30:31.496 --> 30:32.664
PICTURE OF WHAT CAN REALLY

30:32.730 --> 30:35.099
HAPPEN IN THAT ROOM.

30:35.166 --> 30:38.236
>> THIS FALL, MEET TWO TOUGH

30:38.303 --> 30:42.140
COPS, EXPERT INTERROGATORS.

30:42.207 --> 30:42.707
>> KNOCK-KNOCK.

30:42.774 --> 30:45.176
>> WHO WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN

30:45.243 --> 30:46.477
ANSWER.

30:46.544 --> 30:48.846
>> YOU SON OF A BITCH.

30:48.913 --> 30:49.214
YOU GUILTY.

30:49.280 --> 30:56.821
YOU DIRTY RAT BASTARD.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.556
>> THE MURDER IN THE ALLEY.

30:58.623 --> 31:00.592
>> I DIDN'T DO IT.

31:00.658 --> 31:02.860
>> THEY ARE HIGHLY TRAINED.

31:02.927 --> 31:04.229
>> YOU ARE LYING.

31:04.295 --> 31:06.331
>> NO, I'M NOT.

31:06.397 --> 31:08.032
>> LOOKED AWAY.

31:08.099 --> 31:08.733
THAT'S LYING.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.301
>> YOU ARE STARING.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.469
THAT IS LYING.

31:11.536 --> 31:11.736
MORE LIES.

31:11.803 --> 31:16.040
>> INCREDIBLY SKILLED.

31:16.107 --> 31:18.209
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:18.276 --> 31:19.177
>> MAKING EYE CONTACT.

31:19.244 --> 31:21.980
>> ARE YOU LOOKING AT MY

31:22.046 --> 31:22.280
FOREHEAD?

31:22.347 --> 31:22.747
>> NO.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.916
>> THEY'LL SAY ANYTHING TO GET

31:24.983 --> 31:26.084
WHAT THEY NEED.

31:26.150 --> 31:28.553
>> HAVE YOU SEEN ROMA ONE?

31:28.620 --> 31:29.587
>> "STAR WARS" MOVIE?

31:29.654 --> 31:33.891
