00:07.075 --> 00:10.278
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.981
( water drips )

00:14.014 --> 00:15.683
AW, RYDER. YOU'RE CRYING.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.419
AND YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
LIKE SANDRA BULLOCK.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.589
NO NO, I'M NOT CRYING. IT'S
A DRIP FROM THE CEILING.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.491
HONEY, IT'S ALL RIGHT
FOR A YOUNG MAN

00:23.524 --> 00:26.260
TO EXPRESS HIS EMOTIONS
IN FRONT OF HIS AUNT.

00:26.294 --> 00:29.330
YOU KNOW WHAT? SIT
HERE IN THE SAD SEAT.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.733
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S GOING TO PROVE.
HEY, HOLY CRAP.

00:32.766 --> 00:35.736
THE CEILING'S DRIPPING.
WHERE IS THAT COMING FROM?

00:35.769 --> 00:37.705
THAT LEAK.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.273
JUST A GUESS.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.774
YOU GUYS WANT ME TO
GOOGLE A PLUMBER?

00:40.808 --> 00:43.577
NO NO NO, IF I CALL A PLUMBER,
JOE'S GONNA GET BENT OUT OF SHAPE.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.546
YOU KNOW, "BURKE, IT'S
JUST A LITTLE DRIP.

00:45.579 --> 00:49.550
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA CALL SOME SLOB
WITH A TRUCK AND A HAIRY CRACK?"

00:49.583 --> 00:51.452
"BURKE, LET ME DO IT.
SAVE YOU MONEY,

00:51.485 --> 00:54.021
BETTER JOB, NO CRACK,
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY."

00:54.054 --> 00:57.391
NOT BAD, LEN. BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU GOT TO BE MORE SMUG.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.260
I'LL WORK ON THAT.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.661
HEY.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.464
JOE, HEY HEY, REMEMBER THAT
LITTLE LEAK BEHIND THE TUB

01:03.497 --> 01:06.100
THAT YOU SAID WAS NOTHING? WELL, NOW
IT'S SOMETHING. CAN WE CALL A GUY?

01:06.134 --> 01:08.236
CALL A GUY? YOU GOT A GUY RIGHT HERE.
I'LL SAVE YOU MONEY,

01:08.269 --> 01:11.372
I'LL DO THE JOB, LOOK GREAT
DOING IT, EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.674
I COULD NEVER BE THAT SMUG.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.709
I GUESS YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY I'M ALL DRESSED UP.

01:15.743 --> 01:19.113
HMM, COULD YOU SENSE OUR INTEREST
BY THE WAY WE DIDN'T ASK?

01:19.147 --> 01:21.449
AND I'M SURE YOU'RE INTRIGUED AS
TO ALL THE SECRET PHONE CALLS

01:21.482 --> 01:23.684
I'VE BEEN GETTING LATELY AND WHY
I'VE BEEN ACTING SO MYSTERIOUS.

01:23.717 --> 01:27.755
NAH, WE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ANOTHER
ONE OF THOSE WOMEN YOU'RE ASHAMED OF.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.458
NO, I ACTUALLY JUST CAME FROM
MEETING WITH A JUDGE REUBEN BIDDLE.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.493
HE'S THE GUY WHO'S
OVERSEEING THE BANKRUPTCY

01:32.526 --> 01:34.495
AND THE GENERAL WRECKAGE
OF SCANLON FINANCIALS.

01:34.528 --> 01:38.166
JOE, IF I CLOSE MY EYES DURING THIS
STORY, TRUST ME, I'M STILL LISTENING.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.568
WELL, NOW IT CAN BE REVEALED. SOME
OF THE LOST MONEY HAS BEEN FOUND

01:40.601 --> 01:43.204
IN OVERSEAS ACCOUNTS...
$50 MILLION WORTH.

01:43.237 --> 01:46.174
IS THAT WHAT'S IN THE BRIEFCASE?

01:47.241 --> 01:49.543
YEAH.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.679
IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE, BUDDY.
( chuckles )

01:51.712 --> 01:53.447
IN QUARTERS. NO.

01:53.481 --> 01:57.685
LOOK, THE POINT IS THAT LEGITIMATE
STOCKHOLDERS OF SCANLON FINANCIAL

01:57.718 --> 02:00.654
ARE ENTITLED TO A
PERCENTAGE OF THE PROCEEDS.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.623
- HOW MUCH?
- WELL, AFTER TAXES,

02:02.656 --> 02:05.759
- IT'S REALLY JUST A PERCENTAGE OF A PERCENTAGE...
- All: HOW MUCH?

02:05.793 --> 02:07.628
$167,000.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.631
WOW, THAT'S HUGE,

02:10.664 --> 02:12.733
NOW YOU CAN DATE
LESS SHAMEFUL GIRLS.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.704
LIFE-CHANGING MONEY.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.639
YEAH.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.610
HEY, THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.712

EXTRA CRISPY ON THE
EDGES AS ALWAYS.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.508
I'M GONNA MISS THIS LASAGNA.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.211
MISS IT? IT'S RIGHT
HERE IN FRONT OF YOU.

02:57.245 --> 03:00.581
BUT FOR HOW LONG, JOE? HOW LONG?

03:00.614 --> 03:03.183
UNTIL YOU EAT IT.

03:03.217 --> 03:07.355
RYDER, JUST BECAUSE AMOUNT
OF MONEYHIS INCREDIBLE

03:07.388 --> 03:09.790
DOESN'T MEAN THINGS ARE AROUND HERE.
RIGHT, JOE?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.259
YEAH, WHY WOULD
ANYTHING BE DIFFERENT?

03:11.292 --> 03:14.595
I CAN THINK OF
167,000 REASONS WHY.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.930
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS. COME ON.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.732
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF
OURSELVES AND IMAGINE

03:18.766 --> 03:21.168
WILD SCENARIOS BASED ON NOTHING.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.404
WE'LL NEVER SEE JOE AGAIN.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.239
REALLY? HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

03:25.273 --> 03:27.908
BECAUSE HE'S GONNA QUIT. I
MEAN, THAT'S WHAT I'D DO.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.843
I WOULDN'T WANT TO WORK FOR ME.
WOULD YOU WANT TO WORK FOR ME?

03:29.877 --> 03:32.280
UM, N... YES.

03:32.313 --> 03:35.182
I WOULDN'T STOP WORKING FOR YOU
NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU PAID ME.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.551
GO AHEAD, GIVE ME A RAISE.
SEE IF I QUIT.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.553
I KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.790
AND HERE IT IS, THE DAY. HE'LL
BE GONE IN A MONTH. I KNOW IT.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.758
- YOU KNOW, JOE ALWAYS...
- NO NO NO.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.261
NO MORE JOE TALK, ALL RIGHT?
THIS IS A JOE-FREE ZONE.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.297
FROM NOW ON CITY BUSINESS ONLY.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.732
FINE. THE MAYOR'S OFFICE
CALLED TO FIND OUT IF...

03:51.765 --> 03:54.802
I KNOW JOE IS HARD TO HANDLE, BUT
THAT'S PART OF HIS SEMI-CHARM.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.770
YOU KNOW, I... WE...
THE WHOLE HOUSE

03:56.804 --> 04:00.240
HAS REALLY BECOME, YOU
KNOW, SEMI-FOND OF HIM.

04:00.274 --> 04:03.311
WELL, OF COURSE. DEEP
INSIDEN'T HOUSES

04:03.344 --> 04:06.980
JUST WOMEN WITH FEELINGS
AND NEEDS AND DOORS?

04:07.014 --> 04:10.618
MY POINT IS HOW AM I GONNA
FIND SOMEBODY LIKE JOE?

04:10.651 --> 04:13.220
I MEAN, SOMEBODY WHO'S
THAT GOOD WITH THE KIDS.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.489
THAT'S MY MAIN CONCERN.

04:15.523 --> 04:18.892
UH-HUH. FOR YOU OR
LIVING WITH YOU,

04:18.926 --> 04:21.729
DO YOU THINK HE
MIGHT ASK YOU OUT?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.864
WHAT? WHERE DO YOU
GET THESE IDEAS?

04:23.897 --> 04:26.233
NO.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.802
NO. I MEAN NO.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.939
I... LOOK, HE'S NOT EVEN HERE
AND HE'S GETTING ON MY NERVES.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.641
THIS IS JUST LIKE JOE.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.776
OKAY, SHIFTING BACK TO WHAT
THE PEOPLE PAY US FOR.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.512
THE MAYOR'S GALA IS IN A MONTH

04:38.546 --> 04:40.714
AND THE INVITATION IS
FOR MEL BURKE PLUS ONE.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.716
AND SECURITY NEEDS TO
KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.653
- WHO'S YOUR PLUS ONE?
- A MONTH FROM NOW?

04:48.822 --> 04:51.359
- HEY THERE, JOE.
- HEY.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.727
MEL, UM, WE NEED TO TALK.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.429
TALK?

04:55.463 --> 04:57.698
YEAH, ABOUT THE
LIVING SITUATION.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.668
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN SORT OF GOING ON
SINCE I MOVED IN UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE.

05:00.701 --> 05:04.004
THERE'S NO REAL EASY WAY
TO SAY THIS BUT, UH...

05:05.806 --> 05:08.909
THE SHOWERS YOU'RE
TAKING ARE WAY TOO LONG.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.779
- SHOWERS?
- YEAH, IT'S AN OLD HOUSE WITH OLD PIPES.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.381
IT REALLY CAN'T HANDLE
THAT KIND OF USE.

05:13.414 --> 05:16.049
SHORT SHOWERS, RIGHT. I
WENT TO CAMP, I GOT IT.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.719
ALL RIGHT, SO PLUMBING
PROBLEM SOLVED.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.721
GOOD GOOD. NOW LET'S
TALK ABOUT YOU AND ME.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.624
YOU AND ME? LIKE ME AND YOU?

05:23.657 --> 05:26.960
YEAH, YOU KNOW, ABOUT ME
RECEIVING ALL THIS MONEY

05:26.994 --> 05:29.630
AND HOW YOU'RE GONNA
GET ALONG WITHOUT ME.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.366
YEAH, WELL, I THINK
I'LL MANAGE SOMEHOW.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.934
OKAY. WELL, GOOD.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.903
I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I WANT
TO HELP YOU FIND MY REPLACEMENT.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.805
SHOULDN'T TAKE LONGER
THAN LIKE TWO WEEKS.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.708
OH, SO WAIT. YOU'LL BE GONE IN TWO WEEKS?
THAT'S PRETTY FAST.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.611
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF I'M NOT WORKING HERE I
DON'T WANT TO BE TAKING UP YOUR BASEMENT,

05:43.644 --> 05:45.779
AS AWESOME AS IT IS.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.748
BESIDES, I TALKED
TO A BUDDY OF MINE.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.750
HE SAYS THERE'S AN OPEN
APARTMENT IN HIS BUILDING.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.752
OH, WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD
TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.755
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. I
PROBABLY SHOULD. I DID.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.825
OH, YOU DID ALREADY.
WELL, UM, THAT'S GREAT.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.760
- SO HOW WAS IT?
- IT'S NICE.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.630
YOU KNOW, ABOVEGROUND.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.533
YOU KNOW HOW COOL IT IS TO BE ABLE TO
LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW AND NOT SEE ANKLES?

06:05.566 --> 06:06.967
'CAUSE I'D FORGOTTEN.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.570
THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE
MADE A DECISION.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.805
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THINGS ARE CHANGING.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.841
NO REASON TO DRAG IT OUT, RIGHT?

06:13.874 --> 06:16.510
I GUESS NOT.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.512
LISTEN, I WAS WONDERING.

06:18.546 --> 06:21.715
THERE'S THIS MAYOR'S
ANNUAL GALA NEXT MONTH

06:21.749 --> 06:24.051
AND I HAVE TO BRING A DATE. IT'D
BE AWKWARD TO GO WITH MY NANNY,

06:24.084 --> 06:27.521
BUT IN A MONTH YOU'LL BE MY...
WELL, YOU'LL BE MY NOTHING.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.525
OR YOU COULD BE MY PLUS ONE.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.160
WHOA.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.997
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I'VE SAID THAT.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.767
BUT SERIOUSLY, WHOA!

06:41.101 --> 06:42.670
YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET IT.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.638
I'LL JUST FIND ANOTHER PLUS ONE.

06:44.672 --> 06:45.939
NO, WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.476
NO, LET'S DO IT. I
MEAN, YOU KNOW,

06:48.509 --> 06:51.812
'CAUSE ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT GOING OUT...

06:51.845 --> 06:54.114
TO THE MAYOR'S GALA. 'CAUSE
THEY HAD IT LAST YEAR.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.850
IT IS ANNUAL.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.952
YEAH, OKAY. WELL, GOOD THEN.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.489
SO PLUMBING, MOVING, WE COVERED IT ALL.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.724
EXCELLENT. NOW I'M GONNA
TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.060
AND CHANGE LIKE I DO EVERY DAY,

07:11.865 --> 07:13.701
PLUS ONE.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.513
- ALL RIGHT, SMILE FOR ME.
- ( clicks )

07:25.546 --> 07:28.081
THERE WE GO. I'M TAKING PICTURES
OF ALL THE NANNY CANDIDATES.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.117
AND THEN THE FINALISTS WE PUT
THROUGH A LITTLE, YOU KNOW,

07:30.150 --> 07:33.120
DATABASE LAW ENFORCEMENT
BACKGROUND CHECK,

07:33.153 --> 07:35.422
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY OVERDUE LIBRARY BOOKS

07:35.455 --> 07:37.424
OR, YOU KNOW, KILLED A GUY.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.160
GOT IT. WELL, I HOPE
YOU HAVE AN OPEN MIND,

07:40.193 --> 07:43.063
'CAUSE A GUY CAN DO A NANNY JOB
JUST AS GOOD AS A WOMAN CAN.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.599
I KNOW, MAN. YOU'D
BE REPLACING ME.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.602
THEN YOU KNOW HOW TOUGH
IT IS FOR PEOPLE LIKE US.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.170
NO NO, I'M NOT
ANYTHING LIKE YOU.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.205
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I
JUST FELL INTO THIS GIG.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.708
I WAS ACTUALLY A BIG POWER
BROKER AT A HUGE FINANCIAL FIRM.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.944
HAD A CORNER OFFICE,
SECRETARY, THE WHOLE THING.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.212
TILL MY LIFE BLEW UP.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.814
THIS WAS THE ONLY
JOB I COULD GET.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.482
SO, YOU KNOW, TAKE WHAT YOU GET

08:02.516 --> 08:04.117
AND TRY TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.219
I'M SORRY, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
INTERVIEWING YOU HERE, RIGHT?

08:06.253 --> 08:07.755
DO YOU HAVE ANY
QUESTIONS FOR ME?

08:07.788 --> 08:11.224
YEAH, IF YOU'RE NOT THE
BOSS, WHO'S THE BOSS?

08:11.258 --> 08:13.160
UH...

08:13.193 --> 08:15.863
ACTUALLY, SHE IS.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.230
AT LEAST SHE THINKS SHE IS.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.066
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS HER HOUSE,

08:19.099 --> 08:21.134
BUT SHE'S REALLY JUST
MORE OF A FIGUREHEAD.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.870
SHE'S NOT REALLY HERE
THAT MUCH EITHER,

08:22.903 --> 08:25.105
SO IT INVOLVES MORE THAN JUST
TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.641
SO WHAT'S SHE LIKE TO WORK FOR?

08:27.675 --> 08:29.943
UH, YOU KNOW, SHE'S OKAY.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.245
I MEAN, 'CAUSE YOU'RE LIVING HERE YOU
KIND OF GET DRAWN INTO EVERYTHING.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.214
YOU KNOW, AND SHE
LIKES TO SHARE A LOT.

08:34.247 --> 08:37.184
SO, YOU KNOW, THINGS
GET KIND OF INVOLVED.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.787
( chuckles ) BEEN THERE.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.725
CALL SOME OF MY REFERENCES.
VERY SATISFIED.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.928
I HAD THIS ONE WOMAN
WHO KEPT ME AROUND

08:47.961 --> 08:49.597
SIX MONTHS AFTER THE
KID LEFT FOR COLLEGE.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.865
THAT GOT PRETTY INVOLVED.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.167
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:54.201 --> 08:56.536
YOU ARE SHOCKINGLY GROSS.

08:56.570 --> 08:59.773
TELL YOU WHAT, BUDDY, WHY
DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR RESUME

08:59.807 --> 09:02.109
AND YOUR REFERENCES AND WE'LL FIND
YOU A NICE STREET CORNER, OKAY?

09:02.142 --> 09:04.144
- SEE WHO DRIVES BY.
- THERE COULD BE ROOM FOR BOTH OF US.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.279
YEAH, NOT IN THIS HOUSE, PAL.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.281
SO WHO WAS THAT?

09:08.315 --> 09:11.952
A PIG WITH DIMPLES.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.921
I DON'T LIKE ANY OF THE
PEOPLE IN THAT PILE.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.590
WELL, THERE'S NOT GONNA
BE ANYBODY LIKE YOU.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.759
WE'VE TRAINED YOU.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.628
YOU'VE TRAINED ME?

09:20.661 --> 09:23.163
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
YOU WERE LIKE BEFORE?

09:23.196 --> 09:25.799
WE PUT A LOT OF WORK INTO YOU.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.534
AND ALL FOR NOTHING.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.136
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
JUST GONNA DISAPPEAR.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.304
AUNT MEL SAID YOU
FOUND AN APARTMENT.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.807
I MEAN, WHY WOULD YOU COME
BACK HERE ONCE YOU MOVE?

09:33.841 --> 09:35.308
LOTS OF REASONS.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.010
I'VE GOT TO SEE
RYDER'S SOCCER GAMES.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.279
AND, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO
SCARE THE PUDDING OUT OF ALL

09:39.312 --> 09:41.749
THE LITTLE NERDS THAT
COME HERE TO ASK YOU OUT.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.083
YOU THINK I'D MISS OUT
ON THAT KIND OF STUFF?

09:43.116 --> 09:45.218
WELL, WHAT ABOUT AUNT MEL?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.587
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL SEE HER?

09:47.621 --> 09:49.923
YEAH YEAH. I MEAN,
SURE, I HOPE TO.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.793
YOU KNOW, NOT JUST TO HELP HER OUT
WITH HER TAXES LIKE I DID LAST YEAR.

09:52.826 --> 09:56.263
WHEN I TOLD HER THAT SHE COULD WRITE OFF
HER HAIR PRODUCTS AS A BUSINESS EXPENSE,

09:56.296 --> 09:58.231
THE WOMAN WEPT OPENLY.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.335
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT TAXES.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.805
- I'M ASKING IF YOU'D EVER...
- ( doorbell rings )

10:04.838 --> 10:07.340
OH, LOOK AT THAT. THAT
SHOULD BE ESTHER TILLIS.

10:07.374 --> 10:10.077
AND AN EXCUSE FOR YOU
TO AVOID MY QUESTION.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.212
YES, IT IS.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.089
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE ARE.
COME ON IN.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.157
WOW, JOE LONGO'S BACHELOR PAD.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.593
I FEEL HONORED TO BE THE FIRST
SINGLE WOMAN TO CROSS THE THRESHOLD.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.196
YEAH, ACTUALLY YOU WEREN'T.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.699
OH?

10:31.732 --> 10:35.235
NO, THE BROKER YESTERDAY WAS
IN FACT SINGLE AND INTERESTED

10:35.268 --> 10:37.370
AND ON THE PLUS SIDE OF 70.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.007
SO ARE YOU GONNA SEE HER AGAIN?

10:40.040 --> 10:42.342
YEAH, I'M TAKING HER OUT FOR
DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT AT 3:30.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.177
THIS BUILDING HAVE ANY LIGHTS?

10:44.211 --> 10:46.246
OF COURSE IT'S GOT LIGHTS.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.352
BUT NO ELECTRICITY APPARENTLY.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.354
YOU SHOULD GET SOME OF THAT.
CHICKS DIG IT.

10:54.387 --> 10:57.324
ALL RIGHT, I'LL PUT IT
ON THE TOP OF MY LIST.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.260
WHAT'S IN THIS BOX?
IT SMELLS LIKE

11:00.293 --> 11:02.395
CHINESE FOOD FROM THAT
PLACE NEAR YOUR OFFICE.

11:02.429 --> 11:05.733
HEY, IT'S CHINESE FOOD FROM
THAT PLACE NEAR YOUR OFFICE.

11:05.766 --> 11:09.036
YEAH, WELL, I KNEW YOU WEREN'T GOING TO BE
HOME TO COOK FOR ME SO WHAT CHOICE DID I HAVE?

11:09.069 --> 11:10.804
WE'LL HAVE TO DO
IT ON THE FLOOR.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.307
EAT DINNER.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.877
OH, NO WE DON'T.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.979
WHERE'S YOUR IMAGINATION?

11:20.781 --> 11:22.315
ALL RIGHT.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.384
TABLE FOR TWO.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.989
LIGHT 'EM UP, LONGO.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.058
NICE CATCH.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.394
SO AS SOON AS I GET THE MONEY I'M
GONNA RENT MYSELF AN OFFICE.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.864
NOT A BIG PLACE. JUST
SOMETHING SMALL, YOU KNOW?

11:36.897 --> 11:38.832
SO I CAN SORT OF
SPREAD MY WINGS.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.167
I'VE GOT TO GET BACK
IN THE GAME, MEL.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.770
KIND OF A, YOU
KNOW, A NEW PHASE.

11:42.803 --> 11:46.306
MM, A NEW PHASE. KIND OF LIKE
IT IS FOR THE TWO OF US.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.741
YEAH.

11:47.775 --> 11:50.243
YEAH, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WITH ME LIVING HERE...

11:50.277 --> 11:52.279
YEAH AND, YOU KNOW,
NOT WORKING FOR ME...

11:52.312 --> 11:55.348
IT DOES SORT OF CHANGE THINGS.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.854
- ( door opens )
- YOU SURE THIS IS JOE'S APARTMENT?

12:00.888 --> 12:03.423
- YEAH, IT'S THE RIGHT PLACE.
- HEY, COME ON IN, GUYS.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.458
WHY DON'T YOU TURN
ON SOME LIGHTS?

12:05.492 --> 12:07.127
'CAUSE THERE NO ELECTRICITY.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.096
MAYBE YOU JUST NEED
TO FLIP A BREAKER.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.833
RYDER, IF IT WAS THAT EASY, DON'T
YOU THINK I ALREADY WOULD HAVE...

12:12.866 --> 12:14.902
DONE THAT?

12:14.935 --> 12:18.171
HEY, RYDER, LOOKS LIKE THEY
WERE HAVING A NICE MEAL.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.473
YOU KNOW, JUST THE TWO OF THEM.
LET'S GO HOME.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.943
NO NO, BUT WE'VE GOT TO TELL
AUNT MEL ABOUT HER NEW COUCH.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.212
- WHAT NEW COUCH?
- THE ONE WE SIGNED FOR.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.447
IT'S SITTING IN OUR LIVING ROOM.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.182
( gasps ) MY NEW COUCH!

12:29.216 --> 12:31.084
I FORGOT ABOUT THIS.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.253
CUSTOM MADE, CREAM-COLORED
ITALIAN SUEDE.

12:33.286 --> 12:36.223
I ORDERED IT A YEAR AGO, BACK WHEN
I WAS A GLAMOROUS SINGLE WOMAN

12:36.256 --> 12:38.391
WHO DIDN'T LIVE WITH
TEENAGE STAINMAKERS

12:38.425 --> 12:42.195
THAT I LOVE VERY MUCH.

12:42.229 --> 12:45.232
WAIT, WHOA WHOA WHOA. MY NEW COUCH IS
NOT SITTING UNDERNEATH THE LEAK, IS IT?

12:45.265 --> 12:47.267
JOE, DIDN'T YOU FIX THE LEAK?

12:47.300 --> 12:50.770
UH, YEAH, I TRIED TO.
SEE, IT KEEPS MOVING.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.772
WELL, WHAT IF IT MOVES
OVER MY NEW COUCH?

12:52.806 --> 12:54.507
THAT IS $4,000 WORTH
OF ITALIAN SUEDE.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.010
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE MAY
HAVE TO RUN A FEW RED LIGHTS,

12:57.044 --> 12:59.379
BUT THIS IS A FANCY COUCH EMERGENCY.
COME ON.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.481
- I'M SORRY, JOE.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.817
- WE CAN JUST, YOU KNOW, PICK THIS UP LATER.
- OKAY, BYE.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.419
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.922
WHAT? I WAS JUST SAYING GOODBYE.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.358
DON'T MAKE A BIG DEAL.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.096
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.475
I NEVER THOUGHT I
COULD FEEL THIS WAY.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.178
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.981
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE
HOUSE WITHOUT HIM.

13:34.014 --> 13:37.384
AUNT MEL, IT'S JUST A COUCH.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.353
( gasps ) SHE DOESN'T
MEAN THAT, COUCHY.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.422
AUNT MEL, I WAS SLICING A BAGEL

13:42.455 --> 13:43.857
AND I CUT MY FINGER.
IT'S BLEEDING.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.525
WHOA WHOA WHOA. GET THE
HELL AWAY FROM MY COUCH.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.128
- DO YOU HAVE ANY BAND-AIDS?
- YEAH, AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED THEM ALL

13:48.161 --> 13:49.930
IF YOU DON'T BACK THE HELL AWAY.
COME ON.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.033
NO FRUIT JUICE!

13:57.404 --> 14:00.073
MR. LONGO, THERE ARE A LOT OF
PAPERS HERE FOR YOU TO SIGN

14:00.107 --> 14:02.075
BEFORE YOU RECEIVE
YOUR SETTLEMENT.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.011
OH, THIS IS MISS McKENNA.

14:04.044 --> 14:07.480
SHE'S HERE REPRESENTING A NUMBER OF
OTHER CLAIMANTS TO THE SCANLON ASSETS.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.983
- VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
- POSSIBLY.

14:10.017 --> 14:13.420
YOUR AWARD IS ACTUALLY A
LITTLE MORE THAN WE THOUGHT.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.456
I KNOW THAT COMES
AS A BLOW TO YOU.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.259
( chuckles ) I'LL FIND A WAY
TO BOUNCE BACK, YOUR HONOR.

14:19.292 --> 14:23.030
OH, ONE THING BEFORE YOU TAKE
A BATH IN ALL YOUR NEW MONEY.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.032
ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENTS,

14:25.065 --> 14:27.500
MANY OF WHOM ARE
LIVING IN THEIR CARS,

14:27.534 --> 14:31.438
I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE
THE ODDNESS OF YOUR ADDRESS.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.974
- WHAT'S ODD ABOUT IT?
- IT'S THE SAME ADDRESS

14:34.007 --> 14:36.443
WHERE LENNOX AND
RYDER SCANLON LIVE.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.378
YEAH.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.048
YEAH, THAT'S ACTUALLY
A FUNNY COINCIDENCE.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.250
- COINCIDENCE?
- YES, COINCIDENCE.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.418
WHEN TWO UNRELATED THINGS
HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.520
YOU KNOW, KIND OF
LIKE A NICE GUY

14:47.554 --> 14:50.257
BEING TRAPPED IN A ROOM WITH
A BLOODSUCKING ATTORNEY.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.960
YOU LIVE WITH THE SCANLON HEIRS?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.594
WELL, YES.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.863
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY
VERY COMPLICATED.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.932
COMPLICATED?

14:58.966 --> 15:02.602
SO YOU JUST REPEAT WORDS
AND MAKE THEM SOUND EVIL?

15:02.635 --> 15:05.238
THAT IS A TROUBLING CONNECTION.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.507
I HAVE TO SAY I AGREE.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.509
( chuckles ) SHOCKER.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.445
IT MAY APPEAR TO SOME THAT WERE MR.
LONGO

15:12.479 --> 15:14.247
TO RECEIVE ANY AMOUNT
FROM THE SETTLEMENT,

15:14.281 --> 15:16.349
LEWIS SCANLON'S HEIRS
WOULD BENEFIT.

15:16.383 --> 15:19.419
THERE WAS NOTHING SHADY
GOING ON HERE, OKAY?

15:19.452 --> 15:22.522
THIS WAS A JOB. I WAS
THEIR NANNY, OKAY?

15:22.555 --> 15:25.325
THE KIDS NEEDED SOMEBODY, I STEPPED IN.
I'M ACTUALLY VERY PROUD OF WHAT I DID.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.460
SO THERE WAS A CONNECTION?

15:27.494 --> 15:29.929
WELL, YES, THERE
WAS A CONNECTION.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.498
THERE WAS AN EMOTIONAL
CONNECTION.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.500
I'VE BEEN TAKING CARE OF THE
KIDS FOR OVER A YEAR NOW.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.336
- IT'S SORT OF LIKE THEY'RE MY KIDS.
- YEAH.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.238
IT JUST LOOKS AWFULLY MESSY.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.008
YOU KNOW, A DERIVATIVES
BROKER WITH AN M.B.A.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.043
TAKES A JOB AS A
NANNY FOR CHILDREN

15:43.076 --> 15:46.379
WHO JUST HAPPEN TO BE THE OFFSPRING
OF THE FUGITIVE LEWIS SCANLON

15:46.413 --> 15:48.281
WHO WAS YOUR FORMER BOSS.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.350
JUDGE, I OBJECT...

15:50.383 --> 15:53.520
TO HER BEING SUCH AN
UNPLEASANT PERSON.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.057
MR. LONGO, YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CONSULT

15:57.090 --> 15:59.126
WITH AN ATTORNEY BEFORE
RESPONDING ANY FURTHER.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.594
I DON'T EVEN LIVE
THERE ANYMORE, OKAY?

16:01.628 --> 16:03.463
I HAVE A WHOLE NEW ADDRESS NOW.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.564
AS OF WHEN?

16:04.597 --> 16:07.500
YESTERDAY.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.269
YESTERDAY?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.238
AND SHE'S DOING IT AGAIN.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.578
THANKS SO MUCH. I'M SURE
YOU'RE A GREAT NANNY.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.448
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL CALL YOU.
I HATE THEM ALL.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.417
THEY'RE HORRIBLE PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY
THE BIG ONE WITH THE MUSTACHE.

16:24.451 --> 16:27.054
OH, SHE REMINDED ME
THE MOST OF JOE.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.024
COULDN'T WE GET SOME YOUNG
WOMAN FROM, LIKE, SWEDEN?

16:31.058 --> 16:32.459
I MEAN, HOW MUCH
WOULD THAT COST?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.961
I COULD KICK IN SOME
OF MY COLLEGE MONEY.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.963
I'M HUNGRY.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.466
- WHAT'S FOR DINNER?
- OH, YOU'RE ASKING ME?

16:39.499 --> 16:42.135
I DON'T KNOW. GO DIG AROUND IN THE
FREEZER TILL YOU FIND SOMETHING.

16:42.169 --> 16:45.438
HEY, DO NOT TOUCH MY LASAGNA.
THAT IS A PIECE OF HISTORY.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.473
( doorbell rings )

16:46.506 --> 16:49.008
UGH, THIS MUST BE MRS.
CAMPANETTA.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.677
I HATE HER ALREADY.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.682
- HEY.
- YOU RANG THE DOORBELL?

16:55.715 --> 16:58.451
IT'S POLITE. I DON'T
LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.453
AND TO THAT POINT,

17:00.487 --> 17:02.489
DID YOU FIND SOMEBODY TO
FILL MY POSITION YET?

17:02.522 --> 17:05.625
NOPE. NO, THERE ARE STILL
A FEW CREEPY STRANGERS

17:05.658 --> 17:08.128
I HAVEN'T INVITED
INTO MY HOME YET.

17:08.161 --> 17:11.531
OKAY, 'CAUSE I JUST GOT OUT
OF A MEETING WITH THE JUDGE

17:11.564 --> 17:14.201
AND IT APPEARS MY
SETTLEMENT IS GONNA BE

17:14.234 --> 17:16.169
A LITTLE LESS THAN I
ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.139
- HOW MUCH LESS?
- WELL, IT'S STILL GONNA BE SIX FIGURES.

17:19.172 --> 17:22.242
BUT THEY'RE ALL ZEROS.

17:22.275 --> 17:25.345
BUT THAT'S YOUR MONEY. THAT'S NOT FAIR.
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:25.378 --> 17:28.381
APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE FACT
THAT I LIVED HERE WITH LENNOX AND RYDER.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.450
THEY THOUGHT THAT MADE US
SOME SORT OF A FAMILY.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.353
OKAY, SO YOU LOST THE ENTIRE
SETTLEMENT BECAUSE YOU LIVED HERE?

17:33.386 --> 17:35.288
- BECAUSE I HIRED YOU?
- YUP.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.457
NO ONE ELSE WAS GOING TO THOUGH.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.560
SO LOOK, IF, UH...

17:40.593 --> 17:43.096
IF THE JOB IS STILL OPEN...

17:43.130 --> 17:46.032
YOU MEAN YOU WOULD...

17:46.065 --> 17:48.635
WELL, LOOK, I HAVE A TON
OF REFERENCES, OKAY?

17:48.668 --> 17:50.803
AND A LOT OF EXPERIENCE...

17:50.837 --> 17:53.039
DEALING WITH YOU.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.175
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.110
SO IF NOBODY'S
JUMPED ON THIS YET,

17:57.144 --> 18:00.147
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO TO THE
KITCHEN AND MAKE US SOME DINNER?

18:00.180 --> 18:01.514
- OH GOOD LORD, YES.
- OKAY.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.050
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.752
THE CREAM-COLORED
DREAM COUCH, HUH?

18:05.785 --> 18:08.087
- YES, IT IS.
- WOW.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.257
IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT. YOU
SURE IT'S NOT TOO BIG FOR THIS SPACE?

18:10.290 --> 18:12.259
- I LOVE IT.
- OKAY, IT'S YOUR HOUSE.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.661
HEY, JOE, NOW THAT YOU'RE
BACK TO BEING THE NANNY,

18:14.694 --> 18:18.565
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE KIND OF
AWKWARD FOR US TO GO TO THE...

18:18.598 --> 18:21.801
OH, THE ANNUAL
MAYOR'S GALA THING.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.736
YEAH. YEAH, YOU'RE
PROBABLY RIGHT.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.838
NOW THAT WE'RE BACK TO HAVING
A WORKING RELATIONSHIP

18:25.872 --> 18:28.241
IT PROBABLY WOULD
BE INAPPROPRIATE.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.377
HEY, THAT BUCKET IS OUT AGAIN.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.579
I PROMISE YOU I'M GONNA FIX
THAT LEAK TOMORROW, OKAY?

18:32.612 --> 18:34.747
OH, NO NEED. I HIRED A
PLUMBING CONTRACTOR.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.349
WHY? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

18:36.383 --> 18:38.251
HE SAYS IT'S EXTENSIVE
WATER DAMAGE.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.220
- IT COULD BE IN ALL THE WALLS.
- YEAH, SURE.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.589
YEAH, THE SKY IS FALLING.
EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO YOUR WALLET.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.524
COME HERE. I'LL SHOW YOU THIS LEAK.
IT'S LIKE THIS BIG.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.626
IT'S A LITTLE CRACK RIGHT
BEHIND THE TUB. COME ON.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.595
- ( creaking )
- WHOA.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.498
WHAT'S THAT NOISE? IT
SOUNDED LIKE CRACKING.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.800
YEAH. HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.568
I HAVE TO SAY, YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.370
FROM UP HERE THE
COUCH LOOKS PERFECT.

18:57.404 --> 18:58.771
IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT WAS
MADE FOR THE SPACE.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.195
OH MY GOD. JOE, YOU'RE BACK.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.431
YES, I AM.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.798
WHAT'S UP, GUYS? HEY.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.501
COUCHY? COUCHY!

19:28.535 --> 19:30.603
YOU KNOW WHAT, MEL?

19:30.637 --> 19:33.906
A LITTLE CLUB SODA,
THAT'LL COME RIGHT OUT.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.909
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
MY HOUSE IS RUINED!

19:36.943 --> 19:39.412
HEY, RELAX. I LOST MORE
THAN YOU DID TODAY.

19:39.446 --> 19:42.882
THIS IS NOT A CONTEST.
AND IF IT WAS, I WIN.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.785
HEY, GUYS, THE KITCHEN
IS STILL OKAY.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.320
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE GOT TO EAT.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.289
COOL. LET'S GO MAKE SOME FOOD.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.460
ARE YOU GONNA COME, MEL?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.295
YEAH, JUST... JUST A SECOND.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.464
OKAY.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.706
WE'RE GOOD.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.482
LOOK, THERE'S DAMAGE
IN ALL THE WALLS.

20:15.515 --> 20:18.518
- EVERYTHING'S GOT TO COME DOWN.
- IT ALREADY DID.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.287
HOW LONG'S IT GONNA TAKE TO
GET IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.322
WHOA, WHO SAYS IT HAS TO
BE BACK THE WAY IT WAS?

20:22.355 --> 20:24.357
THIS IS A CHANCE TO
RETHINK THE WHOLE HOUSE.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.493
WOULD YOU TELL HER HOW EXPENSIVE
THAT'S GONNA BE, PLEASE?

20:26.526 --> 20:29.228
I NEVER GET IN THE MIDDLE OF
A HUSBAND-AND-WIFE ARGUMENT.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.963
- OH.
- WHOA, HUSBAND AND WIFE?

20:30.997 --> 20:33.600
- YEAH, GIVE ME A LITTLE CREDIT.
- IF I WAS HER HUSBAND, DUDE,

20:33.633 --> 20:35.568
THERE'D BE CLAW MARKS ON THAT DOOR FROM
ME TRYING TO GET THE HECK OUT OF HERE.

20:35.602 --> 20:39.238
COULD HAVE FOOLED ME. SO WHAT
KIND OF REMODEL ARE WE TALKING?

20:39.272 --> 20:41.508
OKAY, FIRST I HATE THE KITCHEN.
SO IF WE COULD RIP THAT OUT.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.975
WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU HATE THE KITCHEN?

20:43.009 --> 20:44.611
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
ACTUALLY USED THE KITCHEN?

20:44.644 --> 20:46.613
I GO IN THERE ALL THE TIME.

20:46.646 --> 20:47.980
YEAH, TO GET YOURSELF A
NICE GLASS OF RED WINE.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.683
OOH OOH, A WINE CELLAR
IN THE BASEMENT.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.585
WAIT WAIT, I LIVE
IN THE BASEMENT.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.487
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

20:54.521 --> 20:55.755
WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE CRAZY.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.557
IF YOU'RE NOT MARRIED
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ENGAGED.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.726
Both: NO.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.628
- ENGAGED? ARE YOU... TO...
- WHY WOULD YOU THINK...

21:01.661 --> 21:04.331
- REALLY?
- IT'S MORE LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER OVER HERE.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.633
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ENGAGED.
OH, TIME OUT.

21:06.666 --> 21:10.937
HEY, WHAT? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN TIME OUT?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.608
