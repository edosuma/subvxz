00:05.958 --> 00:07.916
-<i>Bro, remember Obama?</i>

00:08.000 --> 00:09.375
<i>I do not. Who's that?</i>

00:09.458 --> 00:11.791
<i>Asshole. You do.</i>
<i>Cut it out, man.</i>

00:11.875 --> 00:13.958
-<i>Barack Obama. Just hit me.</i>
-<i>Of course.</i>

00:14.041 --> 00:18.375
<i>Barack Hussein, which by the way</i>
<i>is the coldest middle name in the game.</i>

00:18.458 --> 00:20.958
<i>It's like if my middle name</i>
<i>was Gambino Crime Family.</i>

00:21.041 --> 00:22.916
<i>-It's just gangster. Come on, man.</i>

00:23.000 --> 00:24.833
<i>-I mean, he smoked Newports.</i>
-<i> Newports.</i>

00:24.916 --> 00:26.125
<i>What else you gonna say?</i>

00:26.208 --> 00:29.208
<i>The president of the United States</i>
<i>was smoking Newports.</i>

00:29.291 --> 00:30.666
<i>I'm like, this is my guy.</i>

00:30.750 --> 00:31.708
<i>Bro, has to be.</i>

00:31.791 --> 00:34.958
<i>He's smoking the preferred cigarette</i>
<i>of crackheads across the globe.</i>

00:35.958 --> 00:39.500
<i>That's what I love about Barack,</i>
<i>is like, he's become such an icon.</i>

00:39.583 --> 00:40.750
<i>He's kind of like Jesus.</i>

00:40.833 --> 00:43.416
<i>Like, he could just be whatever</i>
<i>version of him you want him to be.</i>

00:43.500 --> 00:46.000
-<i>Hmm.</i>
-<i>My Barack does gay stuff sometimes.</i>

00:46.083 --> 00:47.750
-<i>Only when on coke.</i>

00:47.833 --> 00:48.875
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

00:48.958 --> 00:51.541
<i>He don't do a lot of coke,</i>
<i>just, like, a little bit off the nail.</i>

00:51.625 --> 00:53.666
<i>And just only when it's,</i>
<i>like, special occasions.</i>

00:53.750 --> 00:54.958
<i>Like a real big win.</i>

00:55.041 --> 00:57.250
<i>He's like, "I'mma do coke</i>
<i>and a little bit of gay stuff."</i>

00:57.333 --> 01:00.666
<i>Does your Barack do coke</i>
<i>to excuse his gay stuff?</i>

01:00.750 --> 01:02.125
-<i>Of course.</i>
-<i>Right.</i>

01:02.208 --> 01:05.375
<i>Then he just has an out at the end to go,</i>
<i>like, "I was on coke. It was fine."</i>

01:05.458 --> 01:06.458
-<i>Yeah.</i>
-<i>Okay.</i>

01:06.541 --> 01:08.875
<i>But really he just</i>
<i>woke up that day wanting to do some stuff.</i>

01:08.958 --> 01:10.625
-<i>"Gonna do gay stuff."</i>
-<i>Yeah.</i>

01:10.708 --> 01:13.333
-<i>"Let me get a bump."</i>
-<i>Yeah.</i>

01:28.583 --> 01:31.083
Yo, yo, yo!
Welcome to <i>The Mo and E-Z Show.</i>

01:31.166 --> 01:36.416
I'm Mo, and to my left is my favorite Jew
with nothing to do, my boy E-Z.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.333
It was a better time, in general.

01:38.416 --> 01:41.208
-2014, bro. Just a good year.
-Unbelievable.

01:41.291 --> 01:42.625
-Meek Mill was with Nicki.
-Mm-hmm.

01:42.708 --> 01:44.916
Bobby Shmurda came out and went in.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.083
-You had the Ice Bucket, uh, Challenge.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.333
-Yes, yes.
-What was that, ALS?

01:49.416 --> 01:52.541
Dude, ALS is the most
paid disease of all time.

01:52.625 --> 01:55.166
-ALS made more than LeBron that year.

01:55.250 --> 02:00.166
-ALS is on the boat with Jay and Beyoncé.
-For sure.

02:00.250 --> 02:03.166
They're like, "Let me
tell you what it's like to be rich."

02:05.541 --> 02:08.916
The BLM movement, though,
is so serious right now.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.291
It's everywhere, for sure.

02:10.375 --> 02:13.583
This feels like they got the same people
who did marketing for Cuties and kale.

02:13.666 --> 02:15.291
-They're Blackening everything.

02:15.375 --> 02:18.583
Black <i>iCarly,</i> Black <i>Wonder Years,</i>

02:18.666 --> 02:20.416
which is set in the same time period,

02:20.500 --> 02:22.708
and it's like, bro,
I don't wanna watch Black Kevin Arnold

02:22.791 --> 02:26.375
gets sprayed by a hose
for a half an hour every friggin' Friday.

02:28.666 --> 02:31.666
Yeah, I feel like once a Black person
won a gold medal for swimming,

02:31.750 --> 02:33.958
it was pretty much a wrap
on race relations.

02:34.041 --> 02:37.083
Yo, I saw a dude fencing in the Olympics,
a Black dude, this past Olympics.

02:37.166 --> 02:39.875
-I was like, "Man, too much."
-You're like, "Over the line."

02:39.958 --> 02:41.375
-Over the line. Back up.

02:41.458 --> 02:43.875
Like, when they took
the Confederate flags out of NASCAR,

02:43.958 --> 02:45.416
I was like, "Nah, let 'em have that."

02:45.500 --> 02:48.041
You take too much too fast,
they be out looking for meat.

02:48.125 --> 02:49.958
-You know what I'm saying?

03:33.333 --> 03:35.791
-Please be seated.
-Oh, my God.

03:35.875 --> 03:38.208
That was standing up for 45 minutes.

03:38.291 --> 03:40.791
-That was, like, the longest one.
-Shh!

03:42.291 --> 03:44.958
So we just finished <i>widduy,</i>
the confession,

03:45.041 --> 03:47.041
which we do in the plural.

03:47.125 --> 03:49.166
-We take responsibility…

03:49.250 --> 03:50.791
Mom, why do I have to wear this dress,

03:50.875 --> 03:52.916
and he gets to dress
like he's at Summer Jam?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.333
…lives were created, but these…

03:55.416 --> 03:57.875
Ezra, where's your yarmulke?

03:59.083 --> 04:00.833
Oh, shit. Left it in the car.

04:00.916 --> 04:04.541
Okay. Honey, I'm not square, okay?

04:04.625 --> 04:07.541
Nobody thinks I'm square.
Everyone thinks I'm cool.

04:07.625 --> 04:08.625
-I'm hip.

04:08.708 --> 04:11.000
People think I'm a very youthful person.

04:11.083 --> 04:14.833
"I get it." You know, you're expressing
yourself with these illustrations.

04:14.916 --> 04:17.458
Graffiti all over your body. Okay, fine.

04:17.541 --> 04:20.958
But it is Yom Kippur, goddamn it.

04:21.041 --> 04:24.541
First of all, can you please stop saying
"I get it" and using air quotes?

04:24.625 --> 04:27.541
And second of all, when someone says,
"I'm cool. I get it,"

04:27.625 --> 04:29.750
they never are cool,
and they never get it.

04:29.833 --> 04:31.916
-You shouldn't have to say that.
-That's not true.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.583
You won't be able to be buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

04:34.666 --> 04:37.083
Bubby, I love you so much, respectfully,

04:37.833 --> 04:39.041
but I'll be dead.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.458
I don't give a shit
where I'm buried, respectfully.

04:41.541 --> 04:43.916
You can take my ashes,
and you can flush them down the urinal

04:44.000 --> 04:45.458
at Dodger Stadium, respectfully.

04:45.541 --> 04:48.333
Oh, so now
you're disrespecting the Dodgers?

04:48.833 --> 04:50.666
I wanna be buried next to Rihanna.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.208
-Rihanna?
-Yeah.

04:52.291 --> 04:55.375
Okay, I'm gonna scrape
those tattoos off myself,

04:55.458 --> 04:58.166
and I'm gonna bury you
in a double-wide coffin with me.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.000
-Okay, how about that?
-Sounds good.

05:00.083 --> 05:01.083
Sounds good.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.166
…their children to bed…

05:07.166 --> 05:08.833
Thanks for that. I appreciate it.

05:11.041 --> 05:13.541
You look like a dad
who lost his kid at Coachella.

05:15.166 --> 05:18.500
You look like the principal
of a Hebrew school version of Hogwarts.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.125
You look like a young Hulk Hogan.

05:22.833 --> 05:26.000
I have a question. What do you
and the rabbi talk about in the car

05:26.083 --> 05:29.583
on the way
to the rabbinical witch outlet store?

05:31.041 --> 05:34.000
Is it a lot of music?
Or is there heavy conversation?

05:42.625 --> 05:43.958
Hi.

05:44.041 --> 05:46.166
-Ezra!
-Hey, how are ya?

05:46.250 --> 05:48.208
-How are ya?
-How old are you?

05:48.291 --> 05:49.708
I'm… I'm 35 now.

05:49.791 --> 05:50.958
Got a girlfriend?

05:51.041 --> 05:52.166
No.

05:52.250 --> 05:55.625
You say that so cavalier,
like it's a bad thing.

05:55.708 --> 05:57.208
You don't like getting pussy?

05:57.708 --> 06:00.125
Well, hearing the word pussy
come out of your mouth

06:00.208 --> 06:02.000
does make me question
whether or not I like it.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.750
It's 2022!

06:03.833 --> 06:06.916
Maybe the kid enjoys
smoking the Hebrew Nationals.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.625
I know you're trying to be progressive,
but it's coming off crazy homophobic.

06:10.708 --> 06:14.916
But it's… it's good to see you.
And, uh, stay… stay alive.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.041
-Hey, hey, bud, bud.
-Hey, Doc.

06:17.125 --> 06:18.541
Hi, how's your penis?

06:19.208 --> 06:21.666
Uh, I think it's… I think it's good.

06:21.750 --> 06:24.583
-Yeah, uh, listen, uh, come with me.
-I think--

06:24.666 --> 06:28.208
Let's go to the bathroom,
and, uh, we'll take a look, okay?

06:28.291 --> 06:30.791
-I'm good.
-No, no, it's fine. It's fine.

06:30.875 --> 06:33.333
Don't… don't worry. Uh, it's on the house.

06:33.416 --> 06:35.083
There's not gonna be a charge.

06:35.166 --> 06:37.791
-No, it's not the price that concerns me.
-Oh.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.625
-It's more the concept.
-I see.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.416
-You sure? We can go--
-Doctor!

06:42.083 --> 06:44.625
My teeth are getting crooked again.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.791
Uh-huh.
If you open your mouth real wide.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.083
-Ezzy.
-Uh-huh.

06:48.166 --> 06:50.583
I want you to be chill right now.

06:50.666 --> 06:53.500
-But Kim Glassman is over there.
-Mm-hmm.

06:53.583 --> 06:55.416
And she is totally checking you out.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.708
-Right now, okay?
-Uh-huh.

06:57.791 --> 07:00.208
And she just completed
her doctorate at Harvard,

07:00.291 --> 07:02.958
and she is crazy lit.

07:03.041 --> 07:04.625
Right over there. You see her?

07:04.708 --> 07:06.458
Yeah, she just--
and she saw you point at her.

07:06.541 --> 07:09.916
-She didn't see.
-Yeah, she 100% percent saw.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.625
She's got it here, here,
the whole nine yards.

07:12.708 --> 07:14.458
Yeah, you like her body and her mind.

07:14.541 --> 07:15.958
-I do. I do.
-Okay.

07:16.041 --> 07:18.166
Yeah, I think, um, my old orthodontist

07:18.250 --> 07:22.083
just did some really weird
sexual shit with me just now.

07:22.166 --> 07:23.750
Who? Oh, Dr. Green?

07:23.833 --> 07:26.625
-Yeah, Dr. Green.
-Oh, yeah, he's in a lot of trouble.

07:26.708 --> 07:29.708
-He's in trouble?
-Yeah, he's in a lot of trouble.

07:29.791 --> 07:31.250
-Yeah.
-Okay, so that's like a thing?

07:31.333 --> 07:33.500
Uh, well,
he hasn't been convicted.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.833
Totally. In the four seconds
I spoke with him,

07:35.916 --> 07:38.083
he tried to pull me
in the bathroom and look at my dick,

07:38.166 --> 07:41.250
so I'm just gonna say
I might support the accusers on this one.

07:41.333 --> 07:42.875
I will say that there is a legal system,

07:42.958 --> 07:45.125
and you have to have respect
for the legal system, Ezzy.

07:45.208 --> 07:46.416
-Okay.
-Yeah.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.375
You're backing him on this one.
All right, okay.

07:48.458 --> 07:49.916
Well, you know…

07:50.000 --> 07:53.083
Innocent until proven guilty.
I believe in that. I'm sure you do too.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.250
-Correct, and I think I'm gonna bounce.
-Right?

07:55.333 --> 07:57.666
-This has been a lot for one Yom Kippur.
-Honey. I love you.

07:57.750 --> 07:59.958
-I love you. You look great. Okay.
-I love my baby boy.

08:14.083 --> 08:16.333
So, um, your mom says you work in finance?

08:16.833 --> 08:18.125
Yes, I'm a broker.

08:18.625 --> 08:22.708
Well, that's, like, gotta be so exciting,
working with so much money all the time.

08:22.791 --> 08:24.416
Yeah, it's not really my dream job.

08:25.000 --> 08:25.958
Well, what is?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.541
You're gonna laugh if I tell you.

08:28.625 --> 08:29.916
-Oh, God.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
You're not, like,
a Reiki instructor, are you?

08:32.083 --> 08:35.541
No. No, my homie and I, we have a podcast.

08:37.708 --> 08:38.958
Seriously?

08:40.416 --> 08:41.916
Yeah, yeah.

08:42.791 --> 08:44.500
Well, what's it about?

08:45.250 --> 08:46.250
The culture.

08:46.958 --> 08:48.125
What culture?

08:48.208 --> 08:49.625
You know, the culture.

08:49.708 --> 08:52.041
Music, fashion, sports.

08:53.208 --> 08:56.666
I mean, you're a Jew from West LA.
What do you know about the culture?

08:56.750 --> 08:58.791
Maybe deli culture, but…

08:58.875 --> 08:59.833
Hmm.

08:59.916 --> 09:02.833
-Mm-hmm.

09:05.541 --> 09:06.750
That's a good one.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.958
<i>Honestly, I'm starting to think</i>

09:10.041 --> 09:12.708
I'm never gonna meet
a woman who understands me.

09:12.791 --> 09:16.125
Bruh, you have got
to stop being so thirsty, man.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.166
It's disgusting!

09:17.250 --> 09:19.000
I don't think I've heard of a man ever

09:19.083 --> 09:21.875
who wanted to be
in a relationship so badly besides Drake.

09:21.958 --> 09:23.541
And I'm talking <i>Views </i>Drake.

09:23.625 --> 09:24.916
I feel like <i>Views</i> Drake.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.625
I feel like I'm alone
on a building in Toronto

09:27.708 --> 09:28.750
dangling my legs off,

09:28.833 --> 09:30.625
wondering what it's like
to feel companionship.

09:30.708 --> 09:31.666
That's the space I'm in.

09:31.750 --> 09:34.750
Well, I need you to dig deep down
in that little Jewish body of yours

09:34.833 --> 09:36.833
and pull out <i>CLB </i>Drake, okay?

09:36.916 --> 09:38.833
<i>Certified Lover Boy </i>energy
all through here.

09:38.916 --> 09:41.750
I don't have <i>Certified Lover Boy</i> energy,
Drake energy right now.

09:41.833 --> 09:45.833
I just don't. I'm… I'm literally…
I'm literally <i>Take Care</i> Drake.

09:46.416 --> 09:48.750
I'm at an Italian restaurant by myself

09:48.833 --> 09:51.416
with a bunch of chains,
drinking Manischewitz out of a goblet

09:51.500 --> 09:53.541
and wondering when the fuck is it my turn

09:53.625 --> 09:55.791
to feel, like,
deep happiness and connection.

09:55.875 --> 09:58.041
And if I'm being honest
about our friendship,

09:58.125 --> 10:01.041
I feel like you're being
a bit Pusha T right now towards me.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.791
And I need you to be more Future to me.

10:02.875 --> 10:05.125
I need a collaboration instead of a diss.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.666
Well, maybe your ass
needs a bully right now, bro.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.333
Someone to push you around.

10:09.416 --> 10:11.166
You're not even giving me <i>Take Care</i> Drake.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.083
You're giving me
"Houstatlantavegas" Drake.

10:13.166 --> 10:15.750
I'm talking
crying over strippers, no beard,

10:16.416 --> 10:17.458
big upper lip.

10:17.541 --> 10:18.833
Get it together, dawg.

10:21.541 --> 10:22.625
You're right, I'm…

10:23.500 --> 10:25.166
I need to be more <i>CLB </i>Drake.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.166
You'll be all right.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.333
Just gotta find that person,
You know what I mean?

10:29.416 --> 10:32.333
<i>Like, you need a shorty who surfs,</i>
<i>but also can Milly Rock.</i>

10:36.250 --> 10:39.750
-Can I help you with that?
-Oh, my God. No, I'm good.

10:39.833 --> 10:42.583
Come on, why are you acting like this?
I feel like you blocked me.

10:42.666 --> 10:45.916
Um, I didn't block you, okay?
I don't do weird shit like that.

10:46.958 --> 10:49.541
-Well, did you change your phone number?
-I did.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.750
Yo, you don't think that's weird?

10:51.833 --> 10:54.791
Chris, do you wanna know why
we really just don't work out together?

10:54.875 --> 10:57.458
Yeah, I'm… I'm really, really curious.

10:57.541 --> 10:59.416
'Cause you don't know how to keep it real.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.666
You just say whatever
you think I wanna hear,

11:01.750 --> 11:02.750
and it feels fake.

11:03.333 --> 11:06.083
And I don't really
feel seen by you in any way.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.500
All I do is see you, girl.

11:08.583 --> 11:11.875
I'm always on your social media.
I'm staring at you right now.

11:12.625 --> 11:14.875
You know what?
It's like James Baldwin said.

11:15.541 --> 11:17.958
"The most dangerous creation
of any society

11:18.041 --> 11:20.125
is the man who has nothing to lose."

11:20.208 --> 11:22.791
I don't have shit to lose
'cause I already lost you.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.833
All right, gimme your phone.

11:25.916 --> 11:28.458
Girl, you had me out here sweating.

11:28.541 --> 11:32.916
It's so crazy because
my dad loves James Baldwin,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.041
and that is,
like, one of his favorite quotes.

11:35.125 --> 11:38.958
And here's a text message
from my dad to you,

11:39.041 --> 11:40.750
telling you to tell me the same shit.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.041
Your father and I are
in a book club together.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.125
-I don't--
-Peace.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.125
-Bye, Chris.
-It's an information exchange.

11:46.208 --> 11:49.541
-Stay away from my house.
-We put each other onto different authors.

11:50.916 --> 11:52.416
-Ra-Ra.
-Stop calling me that!

11:52.500 --> 11:54.083
-Ra--
-It's so weird.

12:07.416 --> 12:09.500
My mom just bought some last night.

12:10.458 --> 12:13.458
Here he is.
Biggest swinging dick in the West!

12:13.541 --> 12:14.625
There he is.

12:14.708 --> 12:18.541
Got his-- You have a big
swinging penis yourself there, my man.

12:23.125 --> 12:24.708
The boss man.

12:24.791 --> 12:26.958
You made that exchange weird, Ezra.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.708
Goddamn it, all right.
What's done is done, right?

12:29.791 --> 12:31.666
I'm… I'm not good with greetings, so…

12:31.750 --> 12:33.250
Just throw back a "hey."

12:33.333 --> 12:35.125
-Hey.
-Grease the wheel and say, "Hey."

12:35.208 --> 12:36.750
-Swing it up.
-"Hey, boss."

12:36.833 --> 12:38.291
-Hey, boss.
-"Champ. Killer."

12:38.375 --> 12:39.416
"Dude." Not dude.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.541
Big dick boss.

12:41.791 --> 12:43.000
Or whatever you wanna say.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.958
"Here he is,
biggest swinging dick in the West."

12:46.041 --> 12:48.000
There we go. You have a big penis.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.750
-Fuck, dude, I'm sorry.
-I'm not even looking for a shake.

12:50.833 --> 12:52.166
You're belaboring a greeting.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.333
Right.

12:53.416 --> 12:56.083
What if I said "great fucking weather"
to you, what would you say?

12:56.166 --> 12:57.791
The weather's great for you too.

12:58.666 --> 12:59.750
You would say that?

13:00.416 --> 13:01.833
I don't know, I--

13:01.916 --> 13:03.916
Forget it.
Just… Just pick up the phone, come on.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
-I understand. Got it.
-We're burning time. Come on.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.833
-Pick it up.
-Let's go. Let's sell some stuff.

13:07.916 --> 13:08.875
You're the man.

13:09.708 --> 13:11.333
-Giddyup.
-Let's go, baby.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.541
Money, money, money, baby.

13:20.291 --> 13:22.083
-<i>Make a complete U-turn.</i>

13:22.166 --> 13:25.458
<i>Then a sharp left turn,</i>
<i>then another U-turn.</i>

13:25.541 --> 13:27.125
What?

13:29.916 --> 13:33.000
<i>Make a complete U-turn,</i>
<i>then a sharp left turn.</i>

13:33.583 --> 13:35.541
<i>-Then another U-turn.</i>
-What the fuck!

13:43.750 --> 13:46.208
-<i>Make a complete U-turn, then--</i>

13:46.291 --> 13:48.583
-What the fuck! What are you doing?
-Get the fuck out!

13:48.666 --> 13:50.541
-Get out! Help! I'm being attacked!
-What?

13:50.625 --> 13:52.458
-You're attacking me! Stop! Stop!
-Get out!

13:52.541 --> 13:54.708
-Please, relax! Fine, okay!

13:54.791 --> 13:57.750
But you're not getting five stars.
This is fucked up.

13:57.833 --> 13:59.958
Fuck you. I'm not no Uber driver.

14:01.291 --> 14:02.166
You're not?

14:02.250 --> 14:04.541
No, I'm not.
I'm on my way to work, weirdo.

14:04.625 --> 14:07.000
-<i>Make a complete U-turn…</i>
-Oh, shit.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.458
I am so sorry.

14:08.541 --> 14:09.708
No, you're not.

14:09.791 --> 14:12.333
You saw a Black woman
in an inexpensive car

14:12.416 --> 14:15.166
and thought it was
your God-given white right

14:15.250 --> 14:17.583
to get in my backseat
and tell me where to go.

14:17.666 --> 14:21.291
It's a tale as old as time
with your racist ass. Get out!

14:21.375 --> 14:24.291
I know this seems like a racism.

14:24.375 --> 14:25.666
-But it's not.

14:25.750 --> 14:29.833
My… My Uber driver is a Black woman
who drives a Mini Cooper.

14:29.916 --> 14:33.000
Her name is Hyacinth Ajanlekoko…

14:33.083 --> 14:34.500
-Oh, wow.
-Butatembe.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.833
-So…
-Okay<i>.</i>

14:35.916 --> 14:39.875
So I guess Hyacinth-whatever
looks like me since we all look alike.

14:40.750 --> 14:44.458
I mean, honestly,
fucking you guys are twins.

14:46.708 --> 14:49.416
Oh, my God, wait.
She really does look like me.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.875
Yeah, this is like a 23 and Me situation.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.666
Like, I wanna introduce you guys.

14:53.750 --> 14:55.666
-Okay…
-You're better looking for sure.

14:55.750 --> 14:58.208
Sir, can you get out of my car, please?
Thank you.

14:58.291 --> 15:01.750
Look, look, look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:02.333 --> 15:03.750
This was insane.

15:04.666 --> 15:07.625
Let me make it up to you.
I know my way around Century City.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.875
Let me get you where you're going.

15:10.666 --> 15:11.666
Who said I was lost?

15:11.750 --> 15:15.083
<i>Make a complete U-turn,</i>
<i>then a sharp left turn,</i>

15:15.166 --> 15:16.875
<i>then another U-turn.</i>

15:18.250 --> 15:20.166
-Look, okay, but can you hurry up?

15:20.250 --> 15:22.250
Because I really cannot be late to work,
for real.

15:22.333 --> 15:23.250
Of course.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.500
-Just make a right at the light.
-Okay.

15:25.583 --> 15:27.666
This ain't no
<i>Driving Miss Daisy</i> shit, okay?

15:27.750 --> 15:29.416
-Okay.
-Don't kill me.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.666
I'm not gonna kill you.
Please don't kill me.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.750
-I'm not.
-You're the one who beat me.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.458
I don't know you. Shit.

15:35.541 --> 15:37.208
My name is Ezra. What is your name?

15:37.291 --> 15:38.375
Amira.

15:56.166 --> 15:57.125
Who's Ezra?

15:57.708 --> 16:00.541
Hello. Dang, why y'all up in my business?

16:00.625 --> 16:02.375
Why's your phone all up
in my business?

16:02.458 --> 16:05.791
Ezra is somebody I met
that I'm going to lunch with.

16:06.375 --> 16:07.916
What kind of name is Ezra?

16:08.458 --> 16:11.750
Is he like
a third-generation civil rights activist

16:11.833 --> 16:14.791
or keeping-the-peace ass nigga?

16:14.875 --> 16:18.250
No, he's… he's white.

16:18.333 --> 16:19.166
He's white?

16:20.541 --> 16:21.958
-Nigga!
-Shut up!

16:22.041 --> 16:24.625
I'm sorry. Just that's new for you.

16:24.708 --> 16:27.125
-I know.
-Sounds interesting.

16:27.208 --> 16:31.125
Well, first of all, you know, don't let
Akbar find out about that. Jesus.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.500
Well, for your information,

16:32.583 --> 16:35.916
I don't date based off
of Daddy's approval, okay? I'm grown.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.208
Okay, you're not tough.

16:52.625 --> 16:53.833
Oh, hi, Daddy!

16:53.916 --> 16:55.208
-What's up?
-Gimme a kiss.

16:56.833 --> 16:58.000
What's going on, boy?

16:58.541 --> 17:00.916
-Same thing.
Yeah.

17:03.041 --> 17:05.375
Hey, now, is it my imagination,

17:05.458 --> 17:08.125
or are Black folks' hair
getting curlier and curlier?

17:08.208 --> 17:10.458
Look. Look at everybody's hair.

17:10.541 --> 17:12.458
Everybody in the place is all wavy.

17:13.916 --> 17:15.125
Except for this nigga.

17:16.125 --> 17:18.416
I actually have
the nappiest hair in this place.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.250
-And I wear it proudly.

17:20.333 --> 17:24.125
-How am I the darkest person in the room?

17:24.208 --> 17:27.291
There's not one
tar-black nigga in this whole room.

17:27.375 --> 17:28.750
And I mean, back in the day,

17:28.833 --> 17:30.958
that was what you saw
the most when you went in a room.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.708
It was, you know, niggas everywhere.
Now you got…

17:33.791 --> 17:35.958
Eventually everybody
gonna be looking like Bruno Mars.

17:37.083 --> 17:38.416
A lot sooner than you think.

17:39.625 --> 17:40.625
What that mean?

17:40.708 --> 17:42.500
Gonna tell him about your date, Amira?

17:43.958 --> 17:46.041
-Shut up, Omar.
-Oh, okay.

17:46.708 --> 17:47.875
What you talking about? Chris?

17:48.458 --> 17:49.916
Oh, no, Daddy, not Chris.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.958
-No, not Chris.
-Not Chris.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.166
He's a Muslim, right?

17:54.083 --> 17:56.833
Um, yes. He's African.

17:56.916 --> 17:59.458
-He's African.
-He's definitely African.

17:59.541 --> 18:01.500
And, um, he's Muslim. I think so.

18:01.583 --> 18:02.958
Is he Sunni or Nation?

18:03.625 --> 18:04.458
S-Sunni.

18:05.583 --> 18:08.541
Watch out for those brothers.
Yeah, they like Lakers fans.

18:08.625 --> 18:11.416
Don't know shit about basketball,
but love to be all up at Staples,

18:11.500 --> 18:13.583
looking around at everybody,
trying to be seen.

18:13.666 --> 18:15.625
Isn't the Nation more like Laker fans,

18:15.708 --> 18:18.041
'cause they're the ones
who just discovered the religion?

18:18.750 --> 18:20.125
Shut up, stupid.

18:20.708 --> 18:21.833
What you drinking?

18:21.916 --> 18:24.708
A tropical banana whip
with bee pollen. It's good.

18:24.791 --> 18:26.583
Bee pollen? Why you need bee pollen?

18:26.666 --> 18:28.916
Bee pollen?
What, they ain't have no butterfly dust?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.458
You know, I'm starting to hate the world
more and more each day.

18:31.541 --> 18:34.541
You know, this place used to be our thing.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.291
Then white folks figured out

18:36.375 --> 18:40.166
that not only did Magic Johnson
and Dr. Sebi figure out how to cure AIDS,

18:40.250 --> 18:42.541
but we also have
delicious patties and smoothies.

18:42.625 --> 18:45.666
Yeah, but, like, shouldn't we be happy
that they're patronizing our business?

18:45.750 --> 18:47.416
But at what cost, Amira?

18:47.500 --> 18:51.875
Uh, financial freedom,
cultural empowerment, market expansion.

18:51.958 --> 18:54.166
You know what? Somebody gonna
bust your teeth out one day.

18:56.083 --> 18:57.958
You just make sure you pray with this guy.

18:58.041 --> 18:59.458
That's how I met your mother.

19:00.041 --> 19:02.416
We prayed together, and we knew
we was meant for each other.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.375
-Mm-mm.
-Didn't you meet Mom at Pep Boys?

19:04.458 --> 19:06.750
Trying to return
a half used bottle of Fix-a-Flat?

19:06.833 --> 19:08.000
No, I met your mother,

19:08.083 --> 19:11.541
and we fell in love
through our mutual love of God and prayer.

19:11.625 --> 19:13.625
-Hmm.
-I'm always telling y'all.

19:13.708 --> 19:16.333
If you get your beliefs in line,
your heart's gonna follow.

19:17.125 --> 19:18.166
Hmm.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.166
So I just imagined the Pep Boys thing?

19:22.250 --> 19:24.125
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

19:43.708 --> 19:46.750
Hold up. You're dating
a "Black girl" Black girl?

19:47.875 --> 19:50.333
I mean, I wouldn't put it that way.

19:50.416 --> 19:54.250
Yo, shut-- Bro, you bagged a real one?

19:54.333 --> 19:55.958
This is crazy.

19:56.041 --> 19:58.291
Wait a minute though.
This is way out of your league.

19:58.375 --> 20:00.083
If this girl is what you say she is,

20:00.166 --> 20:02.916
then I'm pretty sure she smells
like cocoa butter and expectations, bro.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.416
-You may wanna slow down.
-What do you mean?

20:05.500 --> 20:08.625
I'm just saying,
I hope no one ends up dead.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.666
Dead?

20:10.166 --> 20:11.375
Yeah, dawg.

20:11.916 --> 20:13.250
In this social climate,

20:13.333 --> 20:16.208
with this much racial intensity
going on in this country now,

20:16.291 --> 20:18.541
you chose to pull a move like that?

20:18.625 --> 20:21.000
Bold, bro. Real bold.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.000
I'm not pulling anything.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.833
This isn't 'cause it's,
like, a hot new thing.

20:24.916 --> 20:27.958
I'm not talking about a tie-dye sweatsuit.
I'm talking about a person.

20:28.041 --> 20:30.416
A woman who I met,
who I found interesting,

20:30.500 --> 20:34.083
who's different than the other women that
I know, so I asked her out. Who cares?

20:35.458 --> 20:38.291
Yo, please tell me
you didn't buy a tie-dye sweatsuit.

20:38.875 --> 20:39.833
Thank you.

20:44.750 --> 20:45.708
You look great.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.375
Oh, thank you.

20:47.916 --> 20:48.916
I like your fit.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.541
Thank you. You don't look so bad yourself.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.291
Are those Gucci slides?

20:57.041 --> 20:59.458
Yeah. Why? Are you trying to clown?

20:59.541 --> 21:03.916
No, I'm not trying to clown.
No, not at all. I think they're awesome.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.500
And I actually think
they're the perfect shoe for a first date.

21:07.541 --> 21:08.750
Oh, this is date?

21:09.708 --> 21:13.416
Yeah. I mean, we're two adults,

21:13.500 --> 21:16.666
at least one of us is interested
in getting to know the other one,

21:16.750 --> 21:19.125
meeting at a specific place
at a designated time,

21:19.208 --> 21:22.250
and I'm pretty sure if I asked Siri,
"Siri, what is a date?"

21:22.333 --> 21:24.541
That would be the exact bar
she would spit back at me.

21:24.625 --> 21:25.875
Bar? Okay.

21:25.958 --> 21:27.791
All right, Ezra.

21:27.875 --> 21:31.291
-Trying to cap me up. Brave.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.500
And I would never
talk shit on your slides.

21:34.583 --> 21:36.875
If you like something, you like it.

21:36.958 --> 21:39.708
I don't think anybody
should be put in a box ever.

21:43.375 --> 21:46.041
That's real. I agree with you.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
…eats a blueberry
with a damn fork.

22:50.125 --> 22:53.250
You know…

22:54.208 --> 22:55.833
Oh, my God, it looks like a fort.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.416
It's cute. You know
what we're doing? We're being cute!

22:58.500 --> 23:01.500
- We're being cute! Oh, God!
-Yeah.

23:01.583 --> 23:03.416
-You're crazy.
-It's like a little tent.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.250
I've never done this before.

23:05.333 --> 23:08.583
You've just never dated such
a creative blanket architect before.

23:08.666 --> 23:11.208
Never. I've never dated anybody so cute.

23:11.291 --> 23:13.041
Yes, come on, isn't it fun?

23:13.125 --> 23:15.500
It's like we're in our own little world.

23:15.583 --> 23:18.166
It does feel like
we are in our own little world.

23:19.875 --> 23:22.458
Play some music. We need, like, a vibe.

23:22.541 --> 23:23.916
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

23:25.041 --> 23:26.750
Yeah. Any requests?

23:26.833 --> 23:28.291
No, I trust you.

23:32.166 --> 23:34.250
How about this?

23:40.916 --> 23:43.166
Oh, I love this song.

23:44.958 --> 23:45.791
You do?

23:45.875 --> 23:47.000
Mm-hmm.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.750
So look.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.750
I just don't be
having sex with just anyone,

24:22.833 --> 24:25.541
so, whether you like it or not,

24:25.625 --> 24:27.125
we kind of go together now.

24:29.791 --> 24:32.416
Yeah, that's crazy. I was
gonna say a similar kind of thing.

24:32.500 --> 24:35.916
Maybe a little less junior high,
a little more mature, but, uh…

24:36.583 --> 24:39.166
Yeah. You're my boo, come on.

24:40.416 --> 24:41.708
You already know.

24:41.791 --> 24:43.583
-You're obsessed with me.
-No!

24:43.666 --> 24:44.750
I'm obsessed with you?

24:44.833 --> 24:46.125
-Yeah.
-Okay.

24:46.208 --> 24:48.125
I see you leaving stuff around here.

24:48.208 --> 24:49.791
Judaism swagger.

24:49.875 --> 24:51.458
It's such a turn-on.

24:51.541 --> 24:53.500
-I just want a bagel and lox right now.

24:53.583 --> 24:55.958
I love you so much!

24:56.041 --> 24:57.083
So much!

24:57.166 --> 24:59.750
-I can't even restrain you!

25:00.875 --> 25:01.875
Shut up.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.833
I think I'm a little nervous.

25:12.916 --> 25:14.791
No, don't be nervous. I'm nervous.

25:14.875 --> 25:16.208
Why are you nervous?

25:16.291 --> 25:17.875
'Cause my family's crazy.

25:17.958 --> 25:19.458
Everybody's family's crazy.

25:19.541 --> 25:21.791
-No. They're nuts.

25:22.791 --> 25:25.958
-Hello! Oh!
-Hey, Mom. How are you?

25:27.125 --> 25:28.416
-Hi.

25:28.500 --> 25:29.791
-Mom, this is Amira.

25:29.875 --> 25:31.500
Amira, this is my mom Shelley.

25:31.583 --> 25:32.416
Hi, Miss Shelley.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.250
-It's so nice to meet you.
-Oh. Miss Shelley.

25:35.333 --> 25:38.458
Oh, my mom would kill me
if I didn't address you in that way.

25:38.541 --> 25:41.416
Oh, absolutely. Whatever makes
you comfortable is fine with me.

25:41.500 --> 25:44.750
Oh, my gosh, you are so beautiful.

25:44.833 --> 25:47.875
I love your hair. I love your fingernails.

25:47.958 --> 25:49.291
Look at these rings!

25:49.375 --> 25:50.958
-I love them.
-Thank you.

25:51.041 --> 25:52.916
-Thank you.
-Look at that, your name.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.250
What about her earlobes
and the bottom of her feet?

25:55.333 --> 25:57.500
-Oh, shut up. He loves to give me shit.

25:57.583 --> 25:59.125
But I think your earlobes are good too.

25:59.208 --> 26:01.375
-I do. Come in. Come in. Come in.

26:01.458 --> 26:03.333
-Isn't this fun?
-Yeah, good stuff.

26:03.416 --> 26:06.958
Honey, honey, come and meet Amira.

26:07.041 --> 26:09.333
I hope I'm saying that right. Amira.

26:09.416 --> 26:11.541
-Yeah. Amira. It's just Amira.
-Amira. Arnold.

26:11.625 --> 26:13.250
Come in, come in, come in and sit.

26:13.333 --> 26:15.375
-Uh, Amira. Yes!
-Yeah.

26:15.458 --> 26:19.333
We've got cheese and crackers,
but if you need something else,

26:19.416 --> 26:22.041
I can have Lupita run to Whole Foods.
Don't worry.

26:22.125 --> 26:24.875
She's going anyway because she's
picking up my dry cleaning from Browns.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.750
She's, uh, she's from Guatemala.

26:27.833 --> 26:29.625
She, uh, Lupita.

26:30.708 --> 26:33.291
Uh, but, you know,
we're like sisters, actually.

26:33.375 --> 26:35.500
She's literally like family.

26:35.583 --> 26:39.125
I mean, it's not even
like work for her, really.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.833
I'm pretty sure it's like work for her.

26:42.916 --> 26:46.500
I don't think Lupita's coming all the way
down here just, uh, pro bono,

26:46.583 --> 26:48.666
no money exchange, you know.

26:48.750 --> 26:51.375
-Oh, come on.
-I know. I'm just saying.

26:51.458 --> 26:53.250
-No, no, I get it, yeah, but--
-Yeah.

26:53.333 --> 26:54.916
Thank you, but that's not necessary.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.458
-This looks nice.

26:56.541 --> 26:58.875
-Thank you.
-Oh, fabulous.

26:58.958 --> 27:00.916
So, I understand you're a stylist.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.041
Yeah, kind of, I'm, um--
I'm a costume designer.

27:04.125 --> 27:05.916
-But that's kind of like styling.
-Oh.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.041
-Okay.
-And she has the best style.

27:08.125 --> 27:08.958
Yes.

27:09.041 --> 27:11.000
No, that I can tell, yes.

27:11.083 --> 27:14.625
Yeah, I actually do,
uh, a little styling myself.

27:14.708 --> 27:16.041
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:16.125 --> 27:18.708
Oh, Ezra never said anything
to me about that.

27:18.791 --> 27:22.250
I know, 'cause it's 100% not true.
It's the first time hearing of it, so…

27:22.333 --> 27:27.458
No, no. No, no. I mean, on me and Dad--
or on Arnold.

27:27.541 --> 27:29.416
-And a few of our friends, yeah.
-Okay.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.458
Yeah, I… I audit their closets.

27:32.125 --> 27:34.958
Oh, um, how do you do that?

27:35.541 --> 27:37.666
Oh, uh, like, curate their clothes--

27:37.750 --> 27:38.666
Prune.

27:38.750 --> 27:41.625
Exactly. Yeah,
and also give away things to shelters.

27:41.708 --> 27:43.916
I'm just known as someone with good taste.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.125
And, I mean, I'm not trying to brag.
That sounds so braggy.

27:50.833 --> 27:54.500
So, um, Amira, where are you from?

27:54.583 --> 27:55.708
-Here.
-Oh.

27:55.791 --> 27:57.958
Well, Baldwin Hills via Inglewood.

27:58.916 --> 28:00.916
Okay. Baldwin Hills.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.375
Oh, that's something, yeah.

28:02.458 --> 28:05.083
I understand that Mike…

28:05.166 --> 28:08.333
uh, Magic Johnson has done a lot
of wonderful things.

28:08.416 --> 28:10.250
Magic. What a ballplayer.

28:10.333 --> 28:12.083
Boyish enthusiasm he played with.

28:12.166 --> 28:13.541
-Oh, yeah.
-The smile!

28:13.625 --> 28:15.833
-Yeah, he has a marvelous smile.
-Yeah.

28:15.916 --> 28:17.958
Yeah.
I saw him once at Gelson's.

28:18.041 --> 28:20.250
-He's really tall.

28:20.333 --> 28:23.416
Actually, we had
an opportunity to buy there about--

28:23.500 --> 28:26.208
-It was 15 years ago, but…
-Oh, yeah.

28:26.291 --> 28:28.166
-…Arnold wouldn't go for it.

28:28.250 --> 28:31.666
Yeah, it's a shame you missed out on
that first wave of early gentrification.

28:31.750 --> 28:34.291
You could've screwed a lot
of people out of their property value.

28:34.375 --> 28:38.208
Okay, so this is our lovely
and very opinionated daughter Liza.

28:38.291 --> 28:40.750
Come and meet
your brother's new girlfriend.

28:40.833 --> 28:41.666
Hi.

28:42.541 --> 28:43.750
Hi.

28:44.333 --> 28:45.250
I mean,

28:46.458 --> 28:47.583
hey.

28:47.666 --> 28:48.583
Okay.

28:48.666 --> 28:49.708
Pull over.

28:51.625 --> 28:53.875
-She's spoken for.

28:53.958 --> 28:56.500
Um, Liza's gay.
She's queer. She's lesbian.

28:56.583 --> 28:59.958
-L-G-B-T-Q.
-You got it all.

29:00.041 --> 29:02.458
-Which we love and accept.
-Yes.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.291
"Because that is our vibe."

29:04.958 --> 29:06.708
"That's how we roll."

29:06.791 --> 29:10.250
I think she understands.
Is she doing the air quote thing again?

29:10.333 --> 29:11.833
Yeah, she's just warming up.

29:12.916 --> 29:15.625
Oh, I… I really like your glasses.
Those are cool.

29:15.708 --> 29:19.500
Oh, thanks. I actually made them out
of recycled cans of Mountain Dew.

29:19.583 --> 29:20.416
Oh, really?

29:20.500 --> 29:23.833
I could easily make you a pair.
You could have-- they're prescription--

29:23.916 --> 29:28.666
Okay, so I wanna put this out
to the group and see how it lands.

29:28.750 --> 29:29.583
Oh, shit.

29:29.666 --> 29:32.583
-I think the police…
-Okay!

29:32.666 --> 29:36.208
…are and always have been, by the way,

29:36.291 --> 29:38.833
fucked up towards Black people.

29:38.916 --> 29:40.833
And I, for one, hate it.

29:40.916 --> 29:43.041
-To be fair, it's an impossible job.
-Dad.

29:43.125 --> 29:44.875
Okay, Mom,
I'm gonna help you in the kitchen.

29:44.958 --> 29:46.041
-What?
-Now.

29:46.125 --> 29:48.583
You've never offered
to help with anything in your life.

29:48.666 --> 29:49.875
We're gonna do it now.

29:49.958 --> 29:51.208
-Know what else too?
-Come on.

29:51.291 --> 29:53.500
The National Anthem,
I think everybody should kneel.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.708
-Enough. Thank you.
-No, I do. Really.

29:55.791 --> 29:58.708
-Not just the players, in fact.
-We're gonna go check this out now.

29:58.791 --> 30:00.875
-What are you doing?
-Thank you.

30:03.125 --> 30:04.291
I'm sorry about my mom.

30:04.375 --> 30:07.875
-She's literally a moron.
-I like your braids.

30:08.708 --> 30:09.541
Thank you.

30:09.625 --> 30:11.166
Xzibit had braids.

30:11.875 --> 30:13.125
Uh, yeah.

30:13.208 --> 30:16.833
Remember that show <i>Pimp My Ride?</i>
That was a blast. I loved that show.

30:16.916 --> 30:19.666
He seemed like such a cool dude.
Such a gentleman.

30:19.750 --> 30:21.833
You ever bump into him
at any of your showbiz things?

30:22.875 --> 30:24.416
-No.
-No?

30:25.041 --> 30:28.791
-Is he still in the rap game?
-Dad, stop.

30:28.875 --> 30:31.791
-What?
-Just, like, producing sound.

30:31.875 --> 30:34.833
-I like X to the Z. What can I say?
-Dad.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.333
-Over here right now.
-What are you-- What's wrong with you?

30:37.416 --> 30:39.708
Okay, can you just cool it

30:39.791 --> 30:43.166
on everything you are doing and saying
in, like, complete totality?

30:44.333 --> 30:46.708
You are so rude and annoying.

30:46.791 --> 30:48.875
-All right? Yes, you are.

30:48.958 --> 30:51.083
I am being me, and I am thriving.

30:51.166 --> 30:54.083
And I have gotten through
my entire life being me,

30:54.166 --> 30:57.708
and I certainly don't need
my son to tell me how to behave.

30:57.791 --> 30:58.791
My God.

30:58.875 --> 31:01.750
It's just with the police stuff
and, like, Magic Johnson.

31:01.833 --> 31:05.375
Like, you're talking to her
like she's a Black person

31:05.458 --> 31:07.750
and not my girlfriend who is a person.

31:07.833 --> 31:09.875
-That's absurd. I said--
-Is it?

31:09.958 --> 31:12.208
Yes, of course!
I said, "to the group," okay?

31:12.291 --> 31:16.333
I literally said, "I'm throwing this out
to the whole group."

31:16.416 --> 31:18.000
You weren't throwing it out to the group.

31:18.083 --> 31:20.208
'Cause you weren't trying
to hear Dad's perspective.

31:20.291 --> 31:22.583
You never asked a question like that

31:22.666 --> 31:25.666
in every dinner we've had
for the past however many years.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.666
-I talk about that a lot.
-With who?

31:27.750 --> 31:30.750
With all of my friends.
With everybody I know. We are always--

31:30.833 --> 31:33.041
Name one friend
you talk about police brutality with.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.125
Marilyn.

31:34.208 --> 31:35.791
Uh, uh, Josephine…

31:35.875 --> 31:37.875
You and Marilyn
talk about police brutality?

31:37.958 --> 31:39.041
Can't get enough of it.

31:39.625 --> 31:41.833
-Can't get enough of that conversation.
-I don't buy that.

31:41.916 --> 31:43.458
It's a hot topic right now.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.958
All right, look.
Can we not do this right now?

31:47.041 --> 31:48.041
Seriously.

31:48.125 --> 31:51.583
This is about meeting
that lovely woman out there.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.958
And I gotta tell you something,
I think she's absolutely wonderful.

31:59.833 --> 32:01.291
-You do?
-I do.

32:02.041 --> 32:05.083
-And I've got a people sense, you know.
-No, you don't.

32:05.166 --> 32:07.291
Anyway, I think she's wonderful.

32:08.791 --> 32:09.625
She is.

32:12.166 --> 32:13.083
What?

32:15.541 --> 32:18.458
I am… I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

32:19.750 --> 32:22.666
Oh, my God! Oh, my…

32:24.833 --> 32:26.625
I'm so excited.

32:27.416 --> 32:28.250
Yeah.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.041
-So you're okay with that?

32:30.125 --> 32:31.791
Of course I'm okay with that.

32:31.875 --> 32:34.416
Why wouldn't I be okay
with that?

32:34.500 --> 32:36.833
I don't know. Well, she's not Jewish.

32:36.916 --> 32:40.875
Oh, Ezra, you're my baby boy.

32:42.041 --> 32:46.541
And you found an amazing woman
who makes you happy.

32:46.625 --> 32:47.750
End of story.

32:52.375 --> 32:55.416
I mean, would it be nice
if she were Jewish? Sure.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.666
Our people's numbers are dwindling.

32:57.750 --> 32:59.458
-It would make your life easier.

32:59.541 --> 33:01.416
But… But this is great too!

33:01.500 --> 33:06.750
Our family is growing in such
a cool and hip and funky way, you know.

33:07.250 --> 33:10.125
Oh, my God! I'm gonna have
Black grand babies.

33:10.208 --> 33:11.708
Okay. Jesus Christ.

33:11.791 --> 33:13.875
We're a family of color.

33:13.958 --> 33:15.166
-Mom.
-We are the future now.

33:15.250 --> 33:18.666
Mom, just, please,
don't ever say that or think that again.

33:18.750 --> 33:21.083
-What?
-I know it's exciting, but…

33:24.291 --> 33:26.416
-Shh.
-I know. I won't…

33:26.500 --> 33:28.125
That was a while back.

33:32.708 --> 33:33.541
It's true.

33:43.208 --> 33:45.708
-What is happening?

33:45.791 --> 33:47.000
So true.

33:58.166 --> 33:59.125
That's the truth.

34:03.041 --> 34:03.916
Where?

34:04.000 --> 34:05.875
-I'm so sorry.

34:05.958 --> 34:08.875
-It's okay.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.083
-Well, I'm happy for you, E.
-Thank you.

34:13.166 --> 34:15.041
Have you talked to her family yet?

34:15.125 --> 34:16.041
Uh, no.

34:16.958 --> 34:18.125
Do you plan to?

34:18.833 --> 34:21.041
Yeah, just haven't had
the chance to meet them.

34:21.125 --> 34:24.083
So you're telling me you're about
to ask their only adult daughter

34:24.166 --> 34:27.041
to marry you with this baby-ass ring,

34:27.125 --> 34:29.208
and you haven't even met her parents?

34:29.291 --> 34:30.125
Bro.

34:30.208 --> 34:32.750
White dudes really do be
out here living by their own code.

34:33.750 --> 34:36.375
You're gonna have to make up
a story or something for this, bro.

34:36.458 --> 34:38.875
Yeah, it is a small ring.

34:38.958 --> 34:40.833
You think her family
will judge me and stuff?

34:40.916 --> 34:43.166
I'm judging you, nigga. This is terrible.

34:43.250 --> 34:45.541
Yeah, I thought of that.
I thought of that.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.125
I'm just gonna be like,
"It's my grandma's Holocaust ring."

34:48.208 --> 34:50.875
-That's good. That's great.
-I mean, game over.

34:50.958 --> 34:54.041
They can't say shit.
Once you drop the Holocaust, they're like…

34:54.125 --> 34:55.458
But you gotta get it out this box.

34:55.541 --> 34:57.125
-It's not a Holocaust box.
-You're right.

34:57.208 --> 34:59.791
Yeah, you wanna put it
in, like, a satchel, dirty it up.

34:59.875 --> 35:02.083
-Yeah.
-I think you should Holocaust it down.

35:02.166 --> 35:04.166
Yeah, we gotta Holocaust it down,
for sure.

35:04.250 --> 35:06.416
-Indeed.
-Yeah. All right, that's a good call.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.458
-There's a plan.
-Thank you, dude. I appreciate it.

35:15.166 --> 35:17.291
It is so nice to meet you guys.

35:17.375 --> 35:19.666
What's going on? Tell me about life.

35:19.750 --> 35:21.708
How are you? How's work?

35:22.791 --> 35:23.958
Talk to me.

35:24.875 --> 35:26.333
Work… Work is fine.

35:26.416 --> 35:28.708
Grinding. I know.

35:29.541 --> 35:32.541
I know. I'm in the grind myself.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.208
So do you hang out
in the hood all the time,

35:41.291 --> 35:43.541
or do you just come up here
for our food and women?

35:45.625 --> 35:46.958
It's a valid question.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.583
-It is.
-Mm-hmm.

35:51.208 --> 35:55.166
I guess I'm one of those guys
who kind of goes wherever.

35:55.250 --> 35:56.541
You go wherever?

35:56.625 --> 35:59.375
Yeah, I'm kind of like a chameleon
in that way, I guess.

35:59.458 --> 36:03.291
You know, I'll pop into Marathon
and grab a hoodie and some socks,

36:03.375 --> 36:07.333
or, you know,
go play ball at Langston Hughes Park

36:07.416 --> 36:08.541
if there's a good run going,

36:08.625 --> 36:10.666
and Roscoe's is obviously one
of my go-to's.

36:10.750 --> 36:14.291
I mean, the Carol C. Special. Come on!
Where's our waiter?

36:14.375 --> 36:16.375
I'm gonna go see if the waitperson's here

36:16.458 --> 36:18.875
because I feel like we should get it,

36:18.958 --> 36:21.833
'cause I think you guys
deserve more than this.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.625
This is your white granddaddy
coming back to haunt me.

36:28.708 --> 36:30.750
-What?
-That nigga never liked me.

36:30.833 --> 36:34.041
And it started off by him putting
them strong ass genes in you

36:34.125 --> 36:36.333
that lighten up the coffee in my babies.

36:36.416 --> 36:38.041
-Akbar, you sound ridiculous.
-Yeah.

36:38.125 --> 36:40.500
And then he planted
a poison pill in my little baby girl

36:40.583 --> 36:44.500
and it has grown into this white boy
that has invited us to lunch at Roscoe's.

36:44.583 --> 36:48.041
Those children got
beautiful cultural experiences

36:48.125 --> 36:50.541
from those moments
with my granddaddy, so please stop.

36:50.625 --> 36:53.833
-What they got was confused, clearly.
-They are not confused.

36:53.916 --> 36:56.291
They are confused.
You don't think this is confusion?

36:56.375 --> 37:00.250
All I'mma tell you is we don't need to be
arguing in front of the white boy, okay?

37:00.333 --> 37:02.708
I'm not gonna change
how I feel about this…

37:02.791 --> 37:04.708
I'm saying what I wanna say,

37:04.791 --> 37:06.833
and I don't give a fuck
about this white boy.

37:06.916 --> 37:08.375
I'm not asking you to do that.

37:08.458 --> 37:09.875
Hey, gang.

37:09.958 --> 37:12.375
I'm back.
I spoke to the waitress,

37:12.458 --> 37:17.250
and she was upset
that I interrupted her smoke break.

37:17.875 --> 37:19.916
Um, so,

37:20.000 --> 37:25.541
you guys are probably
wondering why I asked you to… to lunch.

37:25.625 --> 37:27.333
It crossed my mind.

37:27.916 --> 37:30.791
-Yeah, what the hell is this about?
-Um…

37:31.541 --> 37:34.666
I wanna… I wanna…
I wanna go way back for a second.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.416
I wanna go back to…

37:36.500 --> 37:37.833
Well, let's go with Jesus,

37:37.916 --> 37:40.625
'cause Jesus Christ
was half Black, half Jewish, right?

37:40.708 --> 37:42.958
Let's start with Jesus. Legend, right? So…

37:43.583 --> 37:48.416
Jesus Christ, technically,
I imagine, had mixed-race children,

37:48.500 --> 37:53.083
which I think is… is great because
mixed-race people are really awesome.

37:53.166 --> 37:55.458
You know, you have,
like, Mariah and Derek Jeter,

37:55.541 --> 37:58.291
and then, of course,
you have the GOAT. He was mixed race.

37:59.458 --> 38:00.291
The GOAT?

38:00.875 --> 38:02.083
The Greatest of All Time.

38:02.166 --> 38:04.791
Yeah, I know what it means,
but who are you referring to?

38:05.375 --> 38:08.083
Our guy, the legend. Malcolm X.

38:08.166 --> 38:10.250
<i>-Our </i>guy?

38:10.333 --> 38:13.791
-Not-- the GOAT. Not… Not my guy. Mr. X.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.708
And I'm saying that, like, he's mixed race

38:16.791 --> 38:20.583
and then if Amira and I had a kid,
that kid would be mixed race,

38:20.666 --> 38:22.708
and it would be a very nice baby.

38:22.791 --> 38:26.875
Maybe not as important
as Malcolm X, but maybe. Maybe!

38:26.958 --> 38:29.583
Maybe my son would be
as important as Malcolm X.

38:29.666 --> 38:31.083
I don't know 'cause I haven't--

38:31.791 --> 38:34.708
And she's not pregnant.
She's not pregnant.

38:34.791 --> 38:38.625
Because we don't even do that much stuff

38:38.708 --> 38:40.333
and when we do,

38:40.416 --> 38:43.125
I… I am careful.

38:43.208 --> 38:44.541
And she's not a prude.

38:44.625 --> 38:47.791
She's gr-- really,
she knows her way around it.

38:47.875 --> 38:50.416
-Okay.
-What I'm saying is I love your daughter!

38:51.166 --> 38:54.875
I… I love her,
and I would make a good husband.

38:57.791 --> 38:59.583
What in the mother of--

38:59.666 --> 39:01.166
I know I quoted <i>Forrest Gump.</i>

39:01.250 --> 39:03.041
Yeah, you know what?
I did quote <i>Forrest Gump.</i>

39:03.125 --> 39:06.416
Because you know who
Forrest's best friend was in the world?

39:06.958 --> 39:07.833
Bubba.

39:08.416 --> 39:11.291
-What?
-And was Bubba Black and Forrest white?

39:12.541 --> 39:14.458
You bet your fucking ass they were.

39:14.541 --> 39:17.333
And… And you know what?
It wasn't about race.

39:17.958 --> 39:21.416
It was about shrimp and partnership,
and they made it work.

39:21.500 --> 39:24.208
And Amira and I have done
a lot of the similar stuff

39:24.291 --> 39:27.458
that Bubba and Forrest did together,
and now we're here,

39:27.541 --> 39:30.375
and I just wanna marry your daughter,
if that's okay.

39:36.083 --> 39:38.875
We never seen no fucking <i>Forrest Gump.</i>

39:41.750 --> 39:44.416
-Ain't this about a bitch?

39:45.666 --> 39:48.833
So it's not bad enough
that y'all make me have to get a vaccine

39:48.916 --> 39:50.458
so I can go into the casino.

39:50.541 --> 39:53.416
-Now y'all coming after my kids?

39:54.583 --> 39:56.333
So you wanna marry my daughter?

39:58.791 --> 40:00.208
Yes. Yes, I do.

40:03.541 --> 40:04.541
Well, Ezra…

40:08.333 --> 40:09.708
you can try.

40:12.833 --> 40:15.208
-No, that's him right now, Mama.

40:15.291 --> 40:17.625
-Oh, okay, I'll call you back.

40:22.875 --> 40:24.208
Hey, what's up?

40:24.291 --> 40:26.208
I just got off the phone with my mom.

40:27.666 --> 40:31.291
Oh, you… you did?
Yeah, what… what did she have to say?

40:31.375 --> 40:32.375
About…

40:33.041 --> 40:36.708
Well, she just told me
that you took her and my dad out to lunch.

40:36.791 --> 40:39.666
It was a nightmare, okay?
I totally blacked out. I fucked up.

40:39.750 --> 40:41.375
I have no idea. I don't remember anything.

40:41.458 --> 40:44.583
Well, lucky for you,
my parents remember everything.

40:45.083 --> 40:47.791
Why would you take my parents
to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles

40:47.875 --> 40:49.208
and without asking me?

40:50.750 --> 40:54.416
I was taking a shot at something, okay?
Just forget it.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.500
Forget it?
Oh, no, please, Ezra, keep going,

40:56.583 --> 40:59.500
'cause I would love to know
about this little brilliant plan of yours.

40:59.583 --> 41:03.458
You wouldn't understand, okay?

41:06.041 --> 41:06.916
Oh, my God.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.500
-I was gonna take your parents out…
-Wait, oh, my God.

41:09.583 --> 41:11.708
-We were gonna have a great time,
-Oh, my God.

41:11.791 --> 41:13.833
And then I was gonna ask their blessing,

41:13.916 --> 41:16.041
and I had this
whole cute proposal planned,

41:16.125 --> 41:18.916
where I was gonna reenact our first
few dates, but then it got messed up.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.458
-No, it's not messed up. It's not.
-No, it is, 'cause your dad--

41:21.541 --> 41:23.458
-No, it's not. Ezra! Ezra!
-Like, it's ruined.

41:23.541 --> 41:25.791
-What?
-You can still go through with it.

41:28.500 --> 41:29.333
When?

41:29.416 --> 41:30.791
-Now! Right now!
-Like now?

41:30.875 --> 41:32.541
Yes, right now.

41:34.708 --> 41:36.041
-Right--
-Hurry up!

41:36.125 --> 41:39.083
Okay, I'm gonna
take off my shoe so I don't crease it.

41:43.750 --> 41:44.875
Amira…

41:47.083 --> 41:48.625
-I love you so much.
-Hmm.

41:49.833 --> 41:53.583
I have never felt so understood
by somebody in my entire life.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.958
I am blown away by your beauty

41:57.666 --> 41:59.625
and your intelligence and your grace.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.125
And now you just do whatever you wanna do.

42:04.833 --> 42:06.000
And if you let me,

42:06.958 --> 42:10.208
I will do everything in my power
to give you the most beautiful life,

42:10.791 --> 42:14.000
filled with love and laughter and joy.

42:17.083 --> 42:18.833
Amira, will you marry me?

42:20.291 --> 42:21.708
Of course.

42:21.791 --> 42:22.791
You will?

42:23.750 --> 42:26.291
-Yes!
-Oh, my God.

42:30.250 --> 42:32.458
Oh! Oh, my God!

42:32.541 --> 42:35.166
It's from the Holocaust,
so that's why it's small.

42:35.833 --> 42:37.583
-Oh, I love you.
-I love you.

42:38.375 --> 42:39.958
I need some color, look.

42:41.125 --> 42:42.583
Sorry it's so small.

42:42.666 --> 42:44.333
No, it's beautiful.

42:45.666 --> 42:48.541
So what's the story again?
It's your grandmother's?

42:48.625 --> 42:51.166
Yeah, it's my grandmother's. It was her--

42:51.250 --> 42:53.250
She got it in the Holocaust or whatever.

42:54.125 --> 42:58.083
But like, how old is she
if it's from the Holocaust?

42:58.708 --> 43:00.083
It's been a minute. I don't know.

43:00.166 --> 43:03.041
I think she got engaged when
she was, like, three or four years old.

43:04.958 --> 43:07.583
-It was a different time, you know.
-So stupid.

43:07.666 --> 43:11.083
-It was a different…
-What is wrong with you?

43:19.875 --> 43:22.333
Don, known you my whole life.

43:22.416 --> 43:24.208
You've been an incredible boss.

43:24.291 --> 43:25.291
I grew up with your kids.

43:25.375 --> 43:28.083
Been on family vacations together.
You've always looked out for me.

43:28.166 --> 43:30.166
-Mm-hmm.
-Been like a father to me.

43:30.250 --> 43:33.125
And working for you these past ten years
has been life-changing.

43:34.250 --> 43:36.125
But it's time for a new adventure.

43:37.416 --> 43:39.750
That's it? That was great!

43:39.833 --> 43:42.833
-That was really good.
-An adventure in podcasting.

43:44.291 --> 43:47.083
Uh, maybe leave the podcast part out.

43:47.166 --> 43:48.125
I'm gonna throw up.

43:48.208 --> 43:50.250
No, wait, no, no, no.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen.

43:50.333 --> 43:54.125
-Dude, I'm…
-Listen. Listen to me though. Relax.

43:54.208 --> 43:56.666
You're doing the right thing.
You just gotta do it.

43:56.750 --> 43:59.208
You understand? You got the juice!

44:00.250 --> 44:02.250
Repeat that. "I got the juice."

44:02.333 --> 44:03.166
I got the juice.

44:03.250 --> 44:05.041
-I got the juice.
-I got the juice.

44:05.125 --> 44:06.666
Say it with some nuts. I got the juice.

44:06.750 --> 44:08.375
-I got the juice!
-Believe in yourself!

44:08.458 --> 44:10.750
-I got the juice!
-I'm not a buster. I got the juice.

44:10.833 --> 44:13.416
I'm not a mark-ass buster like Don.
I got the juice, bitch!

44:13.500 --> 44:14.875
-Period.
-Period!

44:14.958 --> 44:17.541
Okay. Now, when you get home,
we're gonna watch <i>Juice,</i>

44:17.625 --> 44:20.083
because I'm sure Shelley
didn't let you watch <i>Juice</i> growing up.

44:20.666 --> 44:21.791
That is so disrespectful.

44:21.875 --> 44:23.708
-Is it?
-I've seen <i>Juice </i>more than you.

44:23.791 --> 44:25.875
-Ooh!
-I love you.

44:25.958 --> 44:28.458
-I love you. You got this, okay?
-Thank you. All right.

44:28.541 --> 44:32.000
Come on, Don! You little bitch-ass Don!

44:32.083 --> 44:33.541
I'm coming for you, Don!

44:33.625 --> 44:34.958
-Okay.
-Come on!

44:38.500 --> 44:40.833
I do not care, Javier.

44:40.916 --> 44:43.375
-Just get it!

44:45.208 --> 44:47.791
I don't give a rat's ass, okay?
How about that?

44:47.875 --> 44:51.958
My Maserati sounds like
it got gangbanged by the Toronto Raptors,

44:52.041 --> 44:53.125
so fix it!

44:53.958 --> 44:54.916
Jesus!

44:55.750 --> 44:56.583
What's up?

44:58.541 --> 45:00.208
-Cars, huh?

45:01.875 --> 45:02.708
Yeah.

45:03.291 --> 45:04.375
Mm-hmm.

45:05.875 --> 45:06.958
On… On that.

45:07.041 --> 45:09.333
Um…

45:09.416 --> 45:11.125
I, uh, I don't…

45:12.375 --> 45:13.500
I don't think I'm gonna--

45:13.583 --> 45:16.333
I think I'm gonna
not come to work at this address…

45:16.416 --> 45:17.416
-What?
-…anymore.

45:18.500 --> 45:19.750
What are you talking about?

45:19.833 --> 45:22.583
At a different address,
I'm gonna work--

45:22.666 --> 45:26.333
I'm not gonna work here at this address,
so I'm gonna, like, do a different place

45:26.416 --> 45:29.041
that I'm gonna do the work from
that's different work.

45:29.958 --> 45:31.833
Are you trying to quit on me?

45:31.916 --> 45:33.333
Yeah. Goodbye.

45:34.833 --> 45:38.458
Pathetic. Who resigns in Helvetica?

45:38.541 --> 45:40.500
Wait, so you said, "Fuck you, Don"?

45:41.416 --> 45:42.333
Pretty much.

45:42.416 --> 45:43.375
What did he say?

45:43.458 --> 45:47.083
He was like, "You're a great guy.
And like, I'm sorry that--"

45:47.166 --> 45:49.916
"Like, I wish I did better
in a weird way too."

45:50.000 --> 45:53.833
And I was like, "It's all good,
but also like, don't…"

45:53.916 --> 45:55.000
-Period.
-You know, period.

45:55.083 --> 45:56.083
Oh, I love that.

45:56.166 --> 45:58.625
-To the juice.
-To the juice!

45:58.708 --> 46:01.416
Mm. Mm. Mmm!

46:01.500 --> 46:02.333
All right.

46:03.041 --> 46:05.958
Let's talk wedding before I think
too hard about what I actually just did.

46:06.041 --> 46:09.291
Um, sure.

46:10.208 --> 46:13.375
Huh. That's a super reassuring response.

46:13.458 --> 46:14.875
No, babe, I'm sorry.

46:14.958 --> 46:17.833
Look, you know
I love you to death. I really do.

46:18.458 --> 46:19.333
Uh-oh.

46:20.833 --> 46:22.458
I'm just a little worried.

46:22.541 --> 46:26.625
You know, since we got engaged
and got the house, my family,

46:26.708 --> 46:29.458
they've just been on my head
and not in a good way.

46:29.541 --> 46:30.375
So they hate me.

46:30.458 --> 46:32.333
-No! No, no, they don't.
-Your family hates me.

46:32.416 --> 46:35.458
They just don't know you yet, you know.
And I think…

46:35.541 --> 46:38.541
Look, this is gonna take
some getting used to for them.

46:39.083 --> 46:41.708
I mean, and can you honestly say
that your family's excited

46:41.791 --> 46:43.625
to have my Black ass in the picture?

46:44.708 --> 46:46.875
I think a good portion of them are.

46:46.958 --> 46:47.833
For sure.

46:49.750 --> 46:50.833
All right.

46:51.541 --> 46:53.041
Let me think about this.

46:56.875 --> 47:00.541
From where I'm sitting,
I think there's only one thing left to do.

47:02.666 --> 47:06.708
I mean, there are just
so many primary colors in this space.

47:06.791 --> 47:10.125
-Which is very uplifting.
-Alive.

47:10.208 --> 47:11.791
It really is.

47:11.875 --> 47:15.291
-And we are so thrilled about this.
-Mm.

47:15.375 --> 47:18.291
-Mm!
-I mean, they're just precious.

47:19.416 --> 47:23.500
So have you cuties
made any, uh, wedding plans yet?

47:24.041 --> 47:26.041
You know, we've thrown some ideas around.

47:26.125 --> 47:29.041
Yeah, we're thinking something
really small and intimate

47:29.125 --> 47:30.833
that really just represents us.

47:30.916 --> 47:31.833
Uh-huh.

47:31.916 --> 47:34.875
But we should probably talk about
who's gonna officiate the wedding.

47:34.958 --> 47:37.125
Oh, Arnold already talked to Rabbi Singer.

47:37.208 --> 47:38.083
Singer is in!

47:38.166 --> 47:40.083
Yeah, he'd be honored.

47:40.166 --> 47:41.750
Rabbi Singer.

47:42.458 --> 47:44.958
-Hmm.
-So you're not gonna go with an imam?

47:45.041 --> 47:47.250
-Um…
-Who's Auntie Mom?

47:48.000 --> 47:50.333
-There's no Auntie Mom. It's an "imam."
-Imam.

47:51.041 --> 47:52.833
Mm. I'm so sorry.
Can you spell that for me?

47:52.916 --> 47:55.458
I'll spell it for you later.
It's like a rabbi for Muslim people.

47:55.541 --> 47:56.708
-Thank you, Ezra.
-Oh.

47:56.791 --> 47:58.958
-Oh, so you're all Muslim?

47:59.041 --> 48:00.916
-Yes.
-Oh, yes, very much so.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.500
I love it.

48:02.583 --> 48:03.916
That's why I wear this crown.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.708
I love your crown. It's gorgeous.

48:06.791 --> 48:10.500
Babe, you wanna, um,
tell them the story behind that crown?

48:10.583 --> 48:13.041
Well, this kufi that I'm wearing right now

48:13.125 --> 48:15.875
was actually a gift
from the honorable Louis Farrakhan.

48:17.083 --> 48:19.750
Mmm! Love Farrakhan.

48:21.500 --> 48:23.166
You… You love Farrakhan?

48:24.625 --> 48:26.250
Love him. Can't get enough.

48:26.333 --> 48:29.416
He's… He's one of the GOATs.
He's another one of the GOATs.

48:29.500 --> 48:33.125
-Really? What do you love about Farrakhan?
-Yeah, what do you love about Farrakhan?

48:34.500 --> 48:37.208
Probably the same stuff that you do,
just more stuff.

48:38.041 --> 48:39.000
Hmm.

48:39.083 --> 48:40.958
Can you be a bit more specific?

48:41.833 --> 48:43.083
Yeah, um,

48:43.708 --> 48:47.958
I think what I love about him
is his general vibe.

48:48.041 --> 48:51.666
-Ah.
-He's got kind of a no-frills attitude.

48:51.750 --> 48:56.708
And I just think he tells it
like it's gotta be told sometimes.

48:56.791 --> 48:58.166
-Just stop, babe.
-For sure, yeah.

48:58.750 --> 49:01.208
Ooh! Oh, babe,
maybe you should finish telling them

49:01.291 --> 49:03.500
about our private dinner
with the minister.

49:03.583 --> 49:07.583
Oh, well, we were blessed
to be in Brother Minister's company,

49:07.666 --> 49:10.916
and, uh, I got to speak with him
for maybe, like, an hour or so.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.958
-Oh.
-We talked about everything.

49:13.041 --> 49:15.750
How far we've come
and how far we have to go as a people.

49:15.833 --> 49:16.666
No kidding.

49:16.750 --> 49:19.500
And at the end of the conversation,
he actually took this kufi off

49:19.583 --> 49:21.041
and put it on my head.

49:21.125 --> 49:23.750
So this is one of my most treasured gifts.

49:23.833 --> 49:25.083
-Isn't that incredible?
-Yes.

49:25.166 --> 49:27.291
Are you familiar with,
um, the minister's work?

49:28.333 --> 49:31.416
Well, I'm familiar
with what he said about the Jews.

49:31.500 --> 49:32.375
Let's have dinner.

49:32.458 --> 49:34.666
-Yeah.
-I am fucking-- so fucking hungry.

49:34.750 --> 49:36.916
Let's get up and do it. Whoo!

49:37.500 --> 49:40.666
I found this great
new Sirius station on the radio.

49:40.750 --> 49:43.208
-It's '90s West Coast bangers.
-Hey!

49:43.291 --> 49:45.208
It has all the stuff.

49:45.291 --> 49:48.083
Yeah, Dad, I see you
driving down Xzibit highway,

49:48.166 --> 49:51.500
and let's refocus it
to this dinner that Amira made,

49:51.583 --> 49:52.875
because she's a genius.

49:52.958 --> 49:56.166
-Okay, well, let's dig in.
-All right.

49:56.250 --> 49:58.666
So wait, wait, wait, wait.
We're not gonna say grace first?

49:59.625 --> 50:01.041
-No, I mean, yeah.
-Yeah.

50:01.125 --> 50:02.250
Oh, I was gonna say grace.

50:02.333 --> 50:05.500
-I mean, we say grace all the time, so…
-All the time.

50:05.583 --> 50:07.375
Muslim style,
so because you're here,

50:07.458 --> 50:10.083
maybe out of respect,
you would wanna lead.

50:10.166 --> 50:12.458
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, I will do the honors.

50:15.750 --> 50:16.958
Oh.

50:18.125 --> 50:22.125
All praises be to Allah,
who fed us and provided us with drink…

50:22.208 --> 50:23.291
Close your eyes.

50:23.375 --> 50:25.166
…and made us
from among the Muslims.

50:25.250 --> 50:26.833
All praises be to Allah,

50:26.916 --> 50:29.208
who fed me this and provided it for me

50:29.291 --> 50:31.250
without any power or might from myself.

50:31.333 --> 50:34.625
-Correct.

50:36.250 --> 50:37.750
-<i>Amin.</i>
-Definitely.

50:37.833 --> 50:39.250
<i>-Amin.</i>
-Amen.

50:39.333 --> 50:41.625
-<i>Amin.</i>

50:41.708 --> 50:43.333
I couldn't have said it better myself.

50:43.958 --> 50:47.333
So, Ezra tells me that you guys
used to have a boat growing up.

50:47.416 --> 50:48.416
Yeah.

50:48.500 --> 50:49.791
I was thinking that maybe one day

50:49.875 --> 50:52.291
we can rent a boat and go out.

50:52.375 --> 50:53.416
-Hang out.
-Oh.

50:53.500 --> 50:54.958
-All of us.
-That would be really fun.

50:55.041 --> 50:56.916
-I can make that happen.
-We'll think about it.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.833
Because Black folks don't really
have a good relationship with boats.

50:59.916 --> 51:02.333
That's very true. Or water.

51:02.416 --> 51:05.541
Kind of like Jews
with trains, right?

51:05.625 --> 51:07.208
-Wow. Bingo.
-Hmm.

51:08.875 --> 51:12.291
Are you trying
to compare the Holocaust to slavery?

51:13.958 --> 51:17.083
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not doing--
I mean, I wouldn't do that.

51:20.458 --> 51:23.500
Al… Although,
you know, if you think about it,

51:23.583 --> 51:27.625
I think the Blacks and the Jews
have a similar struggle.

51:27.708 --> 51:28.916
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.916
No. So you are kind of sort of
comparing the two.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.041
-Just a little bit.
-Can you pass the potatoes this way, hmm?

51:34.125 --> 51:38.791
Well, the Jews were technically
the original slaves.

51:38.875 --> 51:41.666
-Right? OG slaves.
-Oh, that's interesting.

51:41.750 --> 51:43.666
Oh, you going all the way back to Egypt.

51:44.333 --> 51:47.041
Okay, well, you do know that
that was 3,500 years ago.

51:47.125 --> 51:50.250
Slavery is one
great-grandparent away for us.

51:50.333 --> 51:52.625
-That is correct.
-You know. My grandmother picked cotton.

51:52.708 --> 51:54.708
Well, Daddy,
I don't think that they were trying--

51:54.791 --> 51:56.958
-No, it's true, honey.
-My grandmother picked cotton.

51:57.041 --> 52:00.208
I don't have to go back to Egypt.
I just go back 75 years.

52:00.291 --> 52:03.583
You know, Jews make up one-half of 1%
of the world's population,

52:03.666 --> 52:05.708
because we were
systematically annihilated.

52:05.791 --> 52:06.666
Exactly.

52:06.750 --> 52:09.750
The one and one-half percent
of the population that you make up

52:09.833 --> 52:12.291
seems to be doing pretty good right now.

52:14.041 --> 52:17.916
Uh, yeah, okay, but…

52:18.000 --> 52:22.583
Here's the thing.
It's not like we don't work hard for it.

52:22.666 --> 52:27.166
You know? I mean Arnold,
he works super-duper hard in his practice.

52:27.250 --> 52:30.625
-He's a podiatrist. You do, honey.
-And… And what did his father do?

52:31.208 --> 52:32.166
He was a podiatrist.

52:32.250 --> 52:33.541
And what about his father?

52:33.625 --> 52:36.333
He was a… a podiatrist.

52:36.416 --> 52:37.875
-Yeah, so…
-Well.

52:37.958 --> 52:40.791
-And a bookie.
-Yes, he did that on the side.

52:40.875 --> 52:42.041
He went straight.

52:42.125 --> 52:44.083
All I'm saying
is that our people

52:44.166 --> 52:46.833
came here with nothing
like everybody else.

52:46.916 --> 52:50.083
Actually, you kind of sort of came here

52:50.166 --> 52:53.083
with the money that you made
from the slave trade.

52:53.166 --> 52:54.541
-What? Oh!
-Preach.

52:54.625 --> 52:56.708
-Preach, Mother. Preach, Mother.
-Holy moly.

52:56.791 --> 52:58.333
-Come on.
-It's true. It's very tr--

52:58.416 --> 53:01.208
-I would like to see your sources on that.
-Baby, go get my purse.

53:01.291 --> 53:03.125
I've got my slave receipts in my purse.

53:03.208 --> 53:05.916
-Go get my purse.
-Take that off the table.

53:06.000 --> 53:10.250
I don't turn on the news every day
and see people in yarmulkes getting shot

53:10.333 --> 53:12.458
by police because they was out
minding their business.

53:12.541 --> 53:15.833
Okay, first of all, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

53:15.916 --> 53:17.875
-A very uncomfortable conversation.

53:17.958 --> 53:20.583
Ever figure out what happened
with the potatoes? An ETA on those?

53:20.666 --> 53:21.500
I'm trying.

53:22.500 --> 53:23.583
Are you okay?

53:23.666 --> 53:26.541
I think we need to blow the candles out.
I'm getting an allergic reaction.

53:26.625 --> 53:28.208
Babe, can you move the candles?

53:28.291 --> 53:30.000
-Yes.
-Can you get these candles out of here?

53:30.083 --> 53:31.708
-Yes.
-Candles smell like shit.

53:31.791 --> 53:33.833
-No, it's okay. I got it.

53:33.916 --> 53:37.416
When my grandmother was picking cotton,
your grandfather's picking feet.

53:37.500 --> 53:38.583
Yes, I agree.

53:38.666 --> 53:40.666
I just want you to sit down.
I am hosting.

53:40.750 --> 53:43.250
-No, no. There they go!

53:43.333 --> 53:44.833
I am supposed--

53:44.916 --> 53:47.666
-Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

53:48.500 --> 53:49.750
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, shit!

53:49.833 --> 53:52.458
-Grab some water or something!
-Oh, shit! What the fuck!

53:52.541 --> 53:54.416
What are you doing? Hey! No!

53:54.500 --> 53:57.125
-No! No!

53:57.208 --> 54:00.541
-Stop it!
-I'm sorry! Oh, my God.

54:01.833 --> 54:03.000
Oh, Lord.

54:03.083 --> 54:04.208
Oh, shit.

54:09.041 --> 54:10.666
What are we gonna do?

54:11.333 --> 54:14.708
-About the kufi? It's gone, baby.
-No, our parents.

54:15.333 --> 54:16.541
Who cares?

54:16.625 --> 54:19.375
Like, we don't even have to
worry about that.

54:19.458 --> 54:22.041
I mean, your dad's intense, yeah,
but we knew that going in.

54:22.916 --> 54:24.500
What is that supposed to mean?

54:25.458 --> 54:28.208
Guess it's supposed to mean that
he didn't smile or make one joke--

54:28.291 --> 54:31.125
Oh, wow. Are you trying to say
that my dad's an angry Black man?

54:31.208 --> 54:32.791
I never said he was angry, no.

54:32.875 --> 54:35.708
Yeah, but you're saying
a Black man is intense,

54:35.791 --> 54:37.625
which is insinuating that he is.

54:37.708 --> 54:40.333
He is Black, and he's intense.

54:40.416 --> 54:43.833
Yeah, but you don't say that
as a white person about a Black person,

54:43.916 --> 54:45.791
calling them "aggressive" or "intense."

54:45.875 --> 54:48.833
That's being passive-aggressive
saying that he's an angry Black man.

54:48.916 --> 54:51.500
-Should I say he's not intense?
-Say nothing about my dad.

54:51.583 --> 54:53.708
If anyone should have any beef,
it's with your mom.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.541
She set my dad's kufi on fire.

54:55.625 --> 54:58.500
What's wrong with my mom?
I mean, yeah, she's, like, an idiot,

54:58.583 --> 54:59.916
but she still, like, means well.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.708
It's not like she did it on purpose.

55:01.791 --> 55:03.875
Mm. Yeah, I don't know about that.

55:05.125 --> 55:08.750
All right, I'm not gonna argue
about something so ridiculous, okay?

55:08.833 --> 55:11.000
All right,
let's talk about the rabbi.

55:11.083 --> 55:14.458
I don't think we need that.
Let's just have a friend of ours do it.

55:14.541 --> 55:16.958
Um,
I would like to use our imam.

55:18.333 --> 55:19.208
Your imam?

55:19.291 --> 55:20.666
Mm-hmm.

55:21.541 --> 55:24.333
Okay, Miss Shakur.
When did you get so Muslim?

55:24.416 --> 55:25.958
I've been Muslim. I was born Muslim.

55:26.041 --> 55:28.708
And it's important to my dad,
so I think we should go with it.

55:28.791 --> 55:30.541
Was that Muslim bacon you ate yesterday?

55:30.625 --> 55:32.583
It actually was. It was Jewish bacon.

55:32.666 --> 55:33.583
-Jewish bacon?
-Yeah.

55:33.666 --> 55:35.208
-I don't claim to be super Jewish.
-Okay.

55:35.291 --> 55:37.875
-I eat bacon all day. I don't care.
-Okay. Well, so what? And?

55:37.958 --> 55:39.500
-Yeah, you want an imam to marry us.
-So?

55:39.583 --> 55:41.166
Want me to face the bed towards Mecca?

55:41.250 --> 55:43.208
-I can do that.
-Actually, I do. Very much so.

55:43.291 --> 55:46.125
Okay, cool, I love that four hours ago
you became a devout Muslim.

55:46.208 --> 55:48.500
-For sure.
-Your dad's not even that Muslim!

55:48.583 --> 55:51.416
He heard "Fight the Power" once
and changed his name from Woody to Akbar.

55:51.500 --> 55:54.041
Okay, now you're
going all out of line. Relax.

55:54.125 --> 55:56.125
-You told me that. We joke about it.
-Yeah.

55:56.208 --> 55:58.583
But I didn't tell you that
for you to turn around and tell me.

55:58.666 --> 56:01.625
You're being-- Really, low-key,
you're being an asshole.

56:02.333 --> 56:05.041
-I'm being an asshole?
-Yes.

56:06.791 --> 56:08.208
-Okay.

56:10.583 --> 56:14.166
You know what?
I really-- I don't wanna fight. I can't.

56:14.250 --> 56:16.666
I don't wanna fight about it, okay?

56:16.750 --> 56:19.666
We just had too much
going on tonight. I just… I can't.

56:20.375 --> 56:22.708
Me either.
I don't wanna fight about it either.

56:25.291 --> 56:28.500
Look,
I think our time would be best used

56:28.583 --> 56:31.166
if we just think about how
to move forward.

56:31.916 --> 56:32.916
I agree.

56:34.458 --> 56:37.208
I'm gonna pitch that we just never speak
to these people ever again

56:37.291 --> 56:39.250
and just a full, clean break.

56:40.583 --> 56:42.166
We cannot do that.

56:43.666 --> 56:48.041
You know, I'm thinking that maybe
if we spend more time with them together,

56:48.125 --> 56:51.375
maybe you and my dad can kind of hang out,
just you and him.

56:53.291 --> 56:54.166
Sounds rad.

56:54.250 --> 56:56.416
Then I think he can get comfortable
with you, you know.

56:56.500 --> 56:59.791
And then maybe he'll see
what we have going on.

57:00.625 --> 57:03.250
Just might make him feel, you know…
and you too.

57:04.833 --> 57:06.958
-Okay.
-Okay.

57:08.083 --> 57:09.541
-Okay.

57:09.625 --> 57:12.666
I gotta go to sleep. I started my period,
and it's just been hell.

57:12.750 --> 57:14.041
Yeah, I'm worried too,

57:14.125 --> 57:16.833
'cause I haven't gotten
my period in, like, 35 years.

57:18.125 --> 57:22.125
-I should see a doctor or something.

57:48.541 --> 57:50.916
Amira told me that you
gave up a job in finance

57:51.000 --> 57:52.875
so you could start a podcast.

57:55.666 --> 57:59.291
Yes, that is true.
I know it sounds crazy.

57:59.375 --> 58:01.666
Oh, so you do know that that sounds crazy?

58:03.458 --> 58:05.333
Yes, yeah, I mean, I do. I mean--

58:05.416 --> 58:09.375
-You know it sounds crazy.
-I do. I do, and she, you know…

58:09.458 --> 58:11.833
Look, she's amazing, and she was like,

58:11.916 --> 58:14.625
"Life is short, and you gotta
follow your dream," you know.

58:14.708 --> 58:17.750
How are you gonna
support my daughter by following a dream?

58:18.541 --> 58:20.916
Do you have, like, some dream Bitcoin

58:21.000 --> 58:24.041
or a dream 401or some shit?

58:25.041 --> 58:27.291
I don't have a dream 401.

58:27.875 --> 58:30.166
But I am gonna give it everything I have.

58:32.041 --> 58:34.083
You're gonna give it
everything you've got?

58:34.166 --> 58:35.958
That sounds like some white boy shit.

58:36.041 --> 58:37.875
"I'm gonna give it everything I've got!"

58:37.958 --> 58:40.708
Yeah, I see it. I can handle
the jokes like that, for sure.

58:40.791 --> 58:41.958
I'm not joking.

58:42.041 --> 58:45.541
No, I know you're not joking. I think
that's-- I'm saying you're doing a good--

58:45.625 --> 58:49.333
I'm not trying to do shit.
I'm saying what you just said.

58:49.416 --> 58:51.208
Right.
You weren't doing an impression.

58:51.291 --> 58:53.375
Again, I wasn't saying
you were doing an impression.

58:53.458 --> 58:55.500
Nigga, I don't do impressions.

58:55.583 --> 58:59.458
I don't think-- I don't even--
I don't think you do impressions.

58:59.541 --> 59:02.708
You know, I really did enjoy
meeting your parents the other night,

59:02.791 --> 59:06.083
but I felt so horrible
about your father's kufi.

59:06.166 --> 59:07.250
-You know?

59:07.333 --> 59:09.916
I… I actually…
I have a little piece of it left,

59:10.000 --> 59:12.916
and I was thinking
maybe I could frame it or something.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.833
-Oh, no. It's okay.
-Yeah.

59:14.916 --> 59:16.875
-You sure? I could take it to Michaels.
-Oh, yeah.

59:16.958 --> 59:18.750
And they actually do a pretty good job.

59:18.833 --> 59:21.458
You wouldn't think it for a craft store,
but they do.

59:21.541 --> 59:25.125
He has a lot of kufis at home.
It's fine.

59:25.208 --> 59:26.041
-Oh, he does?
-Yes.

59:26.125 --> 59:29.000
Oh, okay. He's got a kufi closet.

59:29.666 --> 59:31.250
No, it's not a closet.

59:31.333 --> 59:34.958
-No, I'm just making a little…
-It's actually a respectful situation.

59:35.041 --> 59:39.583
Oh, yes, absolutely.
I'm sure it's just a nice shelf, yes.

59:43.166 --> 59:45.125
Sorry. I love this song.

59:45.750 --> 59:47.250
Yeah, it's a hot one.

59:47.333 --> 59:50.166
-It's provocative. Gets the people going.
-Why--

59:50.250 --> 59:52.041
Why you like this song so much?

59:52.708 --> 59:54.708
Oh, it's amazing, man. It's provocative.

59:54.791 --> 59:57.500
Yeah. What, you like the lyrics?

59:57.583 --> 1:00:01.083
I just think it's, like, a jam.
It's just a jam, you know.

1:00:01.166 --> 1:00:02.083
Yeah, you know what?

1:00:02.166 --> 1:00:05.541
What's the title of this song again?
I forgot the name of this song.

1:00:06.958 --> 1:00:09.541
-The name of this song. What is it?
-It's so provocative.

1:00:09.625 --> 1:00:11.500
-What is it? 

1:00:11.583 --> 1:00:13.875
I don't know. I think-- is it "In Paris?"

1:00:13.958 --> 1:00:15.666
Something about something
in Paris.

1:00:15.750 --> 1:00:18.791
-What is it?
-It's "Midnight… Midnight in Paris"?

1:00:18.875 --> 1:00:20.583
-That's not it.
-Is it "Midnight in Paris"?

1:00:20.666 --> 1:00:22.833
It's not "Midnight." It's not "Midnight."

1:00:22.916 --> 1:00:25.041
It's somebody else is in Paris.

1:00:25.125 --> 1:00:28.208
-A pack of pals in Paris?
-That's close.

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:29.458
Are you cold?

1:00:29.541 --> 1:00:30.833
-No.
-There's seat heaters even.

1:00:30.916 --> 1:00:33.333
-Oh. No, I'm okay. Thank you.
-Okay.

1:00:33.416 --> 1:00:36.291
-Ooh, I love this song.

1:00:36.375 --> 1:00:37.458
It is so fire.

1:00:37.541 --> 1:00:39.291
-Do you love it?

1:00:39.375 --> 1:00:43.500
-Oh, yeah, I know this song.

1:00:43.583 --> 1:00:44.791
Oh, it kills me.

1:00:53.625 --> 1:00:54.666
Don't you love that part?

1:00:58.208 --> 1:01:01.625
You know, it's so funny 'cause I think
I don't know the title of the track.

1:01:01.708 --> 1:01:04.875
But I think--
And that's not what I respond to.

1:01:04.958 --> 1:01:07.916
I think I respond to more what it's about,

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:12.833
which is like friendship
with a Parisian backdrop.

1:01:27.625 --> 1:01:30.708
-It's about everybody, you know.

1:01:30.791 --> 1:01:32.916
More your friends
maybe together than mine--

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.416
But we… we should go to Paris.

1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:37.833
-Or the four of us.
-Four of us will go to Paris.

1:01:37.916 --> 1:01:40.083
Then we'll be just like this record.

1:01:40.166 --> 1:01:43.000
If we went to Paris.
Almost like this record.

1:01:43.083 --> 1:01:47.583
It'll be 75% of this record
if we went to Paris together with you.

1:01:47.666 --> 1:01:50.791
I'm not putting
the math together on it, but…

1:01:57.875 --> 1:01:59.291
Can't quite do that note.

1:02:18.875 --> 1:02:21.291
Hey, nigga,
didn't I tell your ass no guns in here?

1:02:21.375 --> 1:02:23.166
-Put that away.

1:02:23.250 --> 1:02:25.583
That's the third time I told you.
God damn it!

1:02:32.333 --> 1:02:33.666
Oh, hey, what's up, Ak?

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:35.416
-What's going on, Ant?
-I'm all right.

1:02:35.500 --> 1:02:38.625
-You got me?
-Oh, yeah, man. Yeah, you and your, uh…

1:02:39.583 --> 1:02:41.750
You and your pigment-challenged friend
have a seat there.

1:02:41.833 --> 1:02:43.916
I got a bleeder.
Let me get this Gorilla Glue.

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.666
I hope the wait ain't too long.

1:02:46.750 --> 1:02:49.875
You don't have a problem
with getting lined up here, do you?

1:02:49.958 --> 1:02:52.833
Yeah. I'm chilling. This place is dope.

1:02:52.916 --> 1:02:53.916
That's right.

1:02:54.750 --> 1:02:58.000
Although, there appears to be a dress code
that I wasn't informed of.

1:02:58.583 --> 1:03:00.208
Great, then we're good.

1:03:00.291 --> 1:03:02.833
Hey, Ak, what's up with White Cuzz?

1:03:04.041 --> 1:03:06.958
Well, I don't know, man. You know,
honestly, I don't really know this nigga.

1:03:09.666 --> 1:03:10.625
Am I White Cuzz?

1:03:11.375 --> 1:03:13.583
-Well, I'm not.
-Hey, yo, White Cuzz.

1:03:14.375 --> 1:03:15.625
I'm White Cuzz, for sure.

1:03:16.791 --> 1:03:18.000
What's up, man?

1:03:18.083 --> 1:03:20.625
Why don't you do me a favor,
slide out of that dead hoodie for me?

1:03:20.708 --> 1:03:21.791
Hmm?

1:03:21.875 --> 1:03:24.583
Your hoodie, nigga, wrong color.
Why don't you take that shit off?

1:03:25.166 --> 1:03:26.208
Oh, shit.

1:03:27.291 --> 1:03:29.958
Oh, yeah, you know what?
It is humid as fuck. Definitely.

1:03:30.041 --> 1:03:32.416
It's funny. You were so cold
in the car a second ago.

1:03:32.500 --> 1:03:35.583
I know, because the AC
was blowing at my throat.

1:03:35.666 --> 1:03:39.375
And I was scared of getting strep,
and then I'm not anymore,

1:03:39.458 --> 1:03:42.041
because we're in this, like,
small place with a bunch of people.

1:03:42.125 --> 1:03:45.291
So I'm like, it's all good.
I'm just gonna take the hoodie off.

1:03:45.375 --> 1:03:48.208
Okay. Wait a minute.
Are you sure you wanna do that?

1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:50.500
I mean, who am I?

1:03:50.583 --> 1:03:53.625
But what's gonna happen
after you take that off? What's next?

1:03:53.708 --> 1:03:55.916
Gonna be getting cornered
by his crew out in the shower.

1:03:56.791 --> 1:04:00.625
Fighting for your manhood every day,
till you get tired and tap out.

1:04:01.208 --> 1:04:03.125
And then you be a certified rag doll.

1:04:03.208 --> 1:04:04.666
Certified rag doll?

1:04:04.750 --> 1:04:08.333
Have you doing their laundry
and taking your commissary tray.

1:04:08.416 --> 1:04:09.666
And the very last face you see

1:04:09.750 --> 1:04:12.750
before you cry yourself
to sleep every night will be his.

1:04:12.833 --> 1:04:14.458
And the first face you see in the morning

1:04:14.541 --> 1:04:17.416
when you wake up
from your nightmares will be his.

1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:20.458
Now, is this the kind of
never-ending vicious cycle

1:04:20.541 --> 1:04:21.833
you wanna get subjected to

1:04:21.916 --> 1:04:24.583
just 'cause you wanted
to take your hoodie off?

1:04:26.833 --> 1:04:28.250
They have a commissary here?

1:04:28.750 --> 1:04:32.333
I always wanted to take
my daughter-in-law on a date like this.

1:04:32.416 --> 1:04:34.750
-Okay, I'm excited.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1:04:34.833 --> 1:04:36.208
-Hi.
-One second.

1:04:36.291 --> 1:04:38.583
-Yes…

1:04:39.250 --> 1:04:41.125
Wow. That's attitude.

1:04:41.208 --> 1:04:43.833
Anyway, they offer this beeswax wrap here.

1:04:43.916 --> 1:04:46.125
-Mm-hmm.
-It's actually from beehives.

1:04:46.208 --> 1:04:47.291
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:04:47.375 --> 1:04:49.166
They have hives here and--

1:04:49.250 --> 1:04:50.250
-Hey.
-Hi.

1:04:50.333 --> 1:04:52.000
Don't you look cute.

1:04:52.916 --> 1:04:56.458
Yeah, that's no problem.
Are you okay with a male therapist?

1:04:56.541 --> 1:04:58.875
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah, Cesar's great…

1:04:59.791 --> 1:05:01.083
I am so sorry.

1:05:01.166 --> 1:05:02.750
Sorry for what?

1:05:02.833 --> 1:05:05.833
Did… Did you not just see what happened?

1:05:05.916 --> 1:05:07.333
No, what just happened?

1:05:08.041 --> 1:05:11.416
Okay. Just so you know,
I come here all the time.

1:05:11.500 --> 1:05:12.625
-Right?
-Okay, yeah.

1:05:12.708 --> 1:05:15.750
-And so then I come in here with you.
-Mm-hmm.

1:05:15.833 --> 1:05:18.958
And they let some white woman
just go in front of us.

1:05:19.041 --> 1:05:20.875
-Oh, oh, I didn't…

1:05:21.833 --> 1:05:24.375
I mean, maybe her appointment
was just ahead of ours.

1:05:24.458 --> 1:05:26.625
I can't believe
what you have to go through.

1:05:26.708 --> 1:05:28.875
-What? What are you--?
-Hang on just a second.

1:05:28.958 --> 1:05:30.875
-No, I really don't think you should--
-I got it.

1:05:30.958 --> 1:05:31.916
Okay, you are.

1:05:33.416 --> 1:05:34.250
Hi.

1:05:34.875 --> 1:05:36.583
Oh, hi.

1:05:36.666 --> 1:05:38.541
Okay, so, um…

1:05:39.500 --> 1:05:42.125
as a future mother-in-law

1:05:42.208 --> 1:05:46.416
of an African-American woman in America,

1:05:47.375 --> 1:05:50.791
I am appalled, and I am disgusted

1:05:50.875 --> 1:05:54.375
to have witnessed the racism
that I just witnessed.

1:05:55.166 --> 1:05:56.666
Wait, what are you talking about?

1:05:56.750 --> 1:05:59.375
Oh, you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

1:06:01.416 --> 1:06:02.333
Hey.

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:08.583
Miss Shelley.
How about we get us some air?

1:06:09.416 --> 1:06:11.875
-Uh, yeah. We're gonna get some air.
-Get some air.

1:06:12.875 --> 1:06:16.833
-Oh.
-Um, it's under Cohen with-- with a C.

1:06:17.416 --> 1:06:19.750
-Yep.
-Get some air.

1:06:27.291 --> 1:06:30.416
-Right here, right here!

1:06:41.708 --> 1:06:44.000
-This looks like a decent run.
-Yeah, man.

1:06:44.083 --> 1:06:46.125
-What's up, Ak?
-What's up?

1:06:46.208 --> 1:06:48.333
Hey, is this anything like Hughes Park?

1:06:48.416 --> 1:06:49.458
Huh?

1:06:49.541 --> 1:06:50.541
Langston Hughes Park.

1:06:50.625 --> 1:06:52.541
You mentioned
that you play there all the time.

1:06:52.625 --> 1:06:54.375
Although a pretty extensive Google search

1:06:54.458 --> 1:06:57.958
and literally every single person I asked
about it never heard of it.

1:06:58.041 --> 1:07:00.166
No, for sure, for sure.
Google's been like…

1:07:01.208 --> 1:07:02.291
Definitely being weird.

1:07:02.375 --> 1:07:04.750
-And that's been, like, issues for me, so…
-Ah!

1:07:04.833 --> 1:07:07.458
I would take it
to the Genius Bar on that one, but, uh…

1:07:07.541 --> 1:07:09.708
Also, it's like a pop-up Langston Hughes,

1:07:09.791 --> 1:07:12.166
but this definitely has,
like, a Langston Hughes Park…

1:07:12.750 --> 1:07:14.500
-Mm-hmm.
-Sort of charisma to it, for sure.

1:07:14.583 --> 1:07:17.291
Yeah, man, why don't you
go out there and get a run in?

1:07:18.458 --> 1:07:20.416
-Now?
-Yeah, man, go play.

1:07:21.333 --> 1:07:23.625
I think there's,
like, a lot of people waiting and stuff.

1:07:23.708 --> 1:07:25.000
Hey, can my man play?

1:07:25.083 --> 1:07:26.583
Yeah, come on in. Let's ball.

1:07:26.666 --> 1:07:27.708
You got next.

1:07:27.791 --> 1:07:29.791
-Hurry up.
-All right, yeah.

1:07:29.875 --> 1:07:33.375
All right, now, go out there
and get your Langston Hughes on.

1:07:33.458 --> 1:07:34.625
I'm gonna.

1:07:34.708 --> 1:07:37.416
Yeah. Hey. "Life for me
ain't been no crystal stair."

1:07:39.166 --> 1:07:41.958
-That's good.
-Uh, that's Langston Hughes.

1:07:42.833 --> 1:07:44.833
I know, dude.
I say that shit all the time.

1:07:44.916 --> 1:07:46.375
That's my email signature.

1:07:53.500 --> 1:07:55.708
-What the hell you doing, bro?

1:07:55.791 --> 1:07:58.125
-Oh, you're filming this?
-Yeah, kind of.

1:07:58.208 --> 1:08:00.541
-You don't have to.
-I know it. I'm doing it for me.

1:08:00.625 --> 1:08:03.666
-Okay.
-Come on now, Langston.

1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.916
Swing that.

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.208
-Come on, dude!
-Come on now, Langston.

1:08:29.250 --> 1:08:30.583
You weren't filming that?

1:08:30.666 --> 1:08:32.708
Nah, I'mma get the next one though.

1:08:34.541 --> 1:08:36.333
Now go around him. That's right.

1:08:37.666 --> 1:08:40.708
Come on now.
Hey, y'all gonna just let him do that?

1:08:53.375 --> 1:08:55.625
Mr. Mohammad, this was awesome.
We gotta do it again.

1:08:55.708 --> 1:08:57.250
Yeah, I had a ball.

1:08:57.333 --> 1:08:59.500
Throw me on a text with these guys.
They're too much.

1:09:05.875 --> 1:09:08.291
-<i>What are you saying?</i>
-<i>Dude.</i>

1:09:08.375 --> 1:09:12.041
Black people and white people
will never be cool. Period.

1:09:12.125 --> 1:09:14.833
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-The truth, dawg.

1:09:15.625 --> 1:09:18.666
You're my best friend
and my business partner.

1:09:18.750 --> 1:09:21.000
Yeah, that's how powerful
this shit is, bro.

1:09:21.083 --> 1:09:24.291
It's kind of like when
you cheat on a woman, right?

1:09:24.833 --> 1:09:27.708
When you cheat on a woman, it's like
you try to move forward but never can.

1:09:27.791 --> 1:09:29.583
Why? 'Cause she just
keeps asking questions.

1:09:29.666 --> 1:09:32.208
She needs to know every detail.
She won't let it go, you know.

1:09:32.291 --> 1:09:34.458
It's like, "Did you strap her?"

1:09:34.541 --> 1:09:37.500
"Did she suck it? Did you guys do anal?"

1:09:37.583 --> 1:09:40.208
This is not where
I was expecting this to go.

1:09:40.291 --> 1:09:42.916
Oh, I mean, it's where it needs to go,
man, 'cause it's the truth.

1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:47.250
For Black people in this country,
white dudes are the cheater.

1:09:48.125 --> 1:09:50.583
And we're the chick who can't move on.

1:09:51.208 --> 1:09:53.166
No matter how bad we want to,

1:09:53.250 --> 1:09:57.208
we can't forget what y'all did
and what y'all are still doing.

1:10:06.375 --> 1:10:08.833
-Oh.

1:10:10.125 --> 1:10:14.125
For those who don't know who I am,
I am Demetrius, uh, <i>Amira's </i>cousin.

1:10:14.208 --> 1:10:15.625
Love her to death.

1:10:15.708 --> 1:10:17.666
And, uh, I'm a wedding planner.

1:10:17.750 --> 1:10:20.458
Okay, first off, my name is "Amira,"

1:10:20.541 --> 1:10:24.083
and you do day parties
at the airport DoubleTree.

1:10:24.166 --> 1:10:27.000
Uh, business is expanding
as it should, right?

1:10:27.083 --> 1:10:30.041
I mean,
if you ain't escalating, what you doing?

1:10:30.125 --> 1:10:31.500
-You know?
-Yeah.

1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:38.333
Well, um, I am Becca
and, uh, also a party planner.

1:10:38.416 --> 1:10:41.125
-I am an old friend of the Cohens.
-Yeah.

1:10:41.208 --> 1:10:44.041
I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be rude or anything.

1:10:44.125 --> 1:10:46.833
But why… why do we need them?

1:10:46.916 --> 1:10:49.833
-Oh, Amira.
-Look, I can't stress this enough.

1:10:49.916 --> 1:10:52.083
But I told you stress is gonna be extra

1:10:52.166 --> 1:10:55.291
if I'm gonna be dealing with her,
'cause I… I gotta be amazing.

1:10:55.375 --> 1:10:57.208
Don't worry about it.
She's gonna cooperate.

1:10:57.291 --> 1:10:58.208
Thank you.

1:10:58.291 --> 1:11:00.041
You know,
you really don't have a lot of time.

1:11:00.125 --> 1:11:02.375
so I do think
we have to jump in pretty quickly.

1:11:02.458 --> 1:11:05.916
I thought maybe we could start
with a theme, lock that down.

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:09.125
Um, and I was thinking
maybe like an old Hollywood.

1:11:09.208 --> 1:11:11.250
I love old Hollywood.

1:11:11.333 --> 1:11:12.791
Right? I know.

1:11:12.875 --> 1:11:14.958
You love the period
when Black entertainers

1:11:15.041 --> 1:11:17.333
couldn't stay
in the hotels they performed in?

1:11:19.458 --> 1:11:21.583
-That's an excellent point.
-Mm-hmm.

1:11:21.666 --> 1:11:23.791
You know,
I've always hated <i>Gone with the Wind.</i>

1:11:23.875 --> 1:11:25.916
Way before you were supposed to.

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:27.416
Before it was cool.

1:11:27.541 --> 1:11:30.541
See, the spirit is moving me
to move in this direction, which is, uh,

1:11:30.625 --> 1:11:33.541
I was thinking more
of, like, a <i>Tron</i> type of feel.

1:11:33.625 --> 1:11:35.041
You know? Remember the '80s <i>Tron?</i>

1:11:35.125 --> 1:11:36.416
-No.
-Yeah.

1:11:36.500 --> 1:11:39.291
So we have a <i>Tron</i> type of wedding,
but a hood <i>Tron,</i> you know.

1:11:39.375 --> 1:11:41.333
Keep it…. Keep it less expensive

1:11:41.416 --> 1:11:45.583
by having, uh, LED light suits instead
of the regular suits.

1:11:45.666 --> 1:11:49.166
Have it in the hood, having real people
doing real things in the <i>Tron </i>world.

1:11:49.250 --> 1:11:51.291
-I… I don't think--
-I like that.

1:11:51.375 --> 1:11:53.916
-I don't.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, brother, there we are.

1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.375
A little clarity.

1:11:55.458 --> 1:11:58.791
Do you mean that everybody
wears the same suit to the wedding?

1:11:58.875 --> 1:12:01.625
Nah, you pick your color,
but you gotta get in where you fit in.

1:12:01.708 --> 1:12:02.791
First come, first serve.

1:12:02.875 --> 1:12:04.375
I want a red-- I want a red one.

1:12:04.458 --> 1:12:06.833
You want the red one?
We got that. So the red is gone.

1:12:06.916 --> 1:12:08.416
Where do we get the suits?

1:12:08.500 --> 1:12:09.708
Oh, I'll bring the suits, yeah.

1:12:09.791 --> 1:12:12.458
I'll bring the suits.
I got 40 hood <i>Tron</i> suits,

1:12:12.541 --> 1:12:14.208
and, uh, they light up.

1:12:14.291 --> 1:12:16.458
-All of 'em work. It's gonna be great.
-Mm.

1:12:16.541 --> 1:12:18.875
-And you have 40 of them?
-Forty of 'em.

1:12:18.958 --> 1:12:21.666
Anybody outside of y'all wedding,
more than 40 people,

1:12:21.750 --> 1:12:23.083
then that's on y'all.

1:12:23.166 --> 1:12:26.083
I wouldn't bring them
'cause they couldn't fit in the suit.

1:12:26.625 --> 1:12:28.833
They gonna look weird
without being in a suit.

1:12:28.916 --> 1:12:31.333
-It'll be cool, brother. There you go.
-That sounds different.

1:12:31.416 --> 1:12:34.583
-Ain't nobody did the Tron wedding.
-Ain't nobody did that.

1:12:34.666 --> 1:12:36.750
Yo, our parents are killing us.

1:12:36.833 --> 1:12:37.750
I know.

1:12:37.833 --> 1:12:41.416
The good news is
we are almost done with it.

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.583
And they've been so busy,
they're basically out of our lives.

1:12:44.666 --> 1:12:46.708
You're right.
I haven't heard from my mom in days.

1:12:46.791 --> 1:12:47.958
It's been amazing.

1:12:48.041 --> 1:12:50.750
Yeah, I haven't heard
from my dad either, which is rare,

1:12:50.833 --> 1:12:54.833
because he hasn't even sent one
of his "form follows function" texts.

1:12:55.625 --> 1:12:57.708
Do you think
something terrible happened to him?

1:12:57.791 --> 1:13:00.166
Oh, my God, no. Why would you say that?

1:13:00.250 --> 1:13:01.875
No, I-- that would be horrible.

1:13:03.291 --> 1:13:07.416
That would be the worst.
I'm just making sure he's okay.

1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:09.500
Anyway, babe, I gotta go.

1:13:09.583 --> 1:13:11.708
-I don't wanna be late. Kiss.
-You look beautiful.

1:13:12.458 --> 1:13:13.416
Thank you.

1:13:13.500 --> 1:13:16.416
You're gonna kill it.
Remember, you got the juice.

1:13:16.500 --> 1:13:18.291
You really
haven't seen that movie, have you?

1:13:18.375 --> 1:13:20.708
If you fucking say
I haven't seen <i>Juice</i> one more time,

1:13:20.791 --> 1:13:22.083
I will leave your ass.

1:13:24.375 --> 1:13:28.041
That's why with the Victorian dress,
I went with the blues and the greens.

1:13:28.125 --> 1:13:30.291
A very rich color for this time.

1:13:30.375 --> 1:13:33.333
And just so you guys know, I have
really great relationships downtown,

1:13:33.416 --> 1:13:36.625
and I can get high-quality fabrics
for, like, a fraction of the cost.

1:13:36.708 --> 1:13:38.250
-This is great.
-Yeah.

1:13:38.333 --> 1:13:40.458
I would love to leave you guys
with some of my sketches.

1:13:40.541 --> 1:13:41.625
That would be amazing.

1:13:41.708 --> 1:13:44.041
Man. And can you remind me
when you graduated Harvard?

1:13:44.125 --> 1:13:46.000
It's just maybe we know the same people.

1:13:46.625 --> 1:13:48.041
Oh, um,

1:13:48.125 --> 1:13:51.166
I… I didn't go to, um, Harvard.
I went to Howard.

1:13:51.791 --> 1:13:54.000
Howard. Sounds kind of similar.

1:13:54.083 --> 1:13:55.625
It's like a Black Harvard.

1:13:57.541 --> 1:13:58.791
Interesting.

1:14:01.541 --> 1:14:02.625
Let's go!

1:14:02.708 --> 1:14:05.333
No, I'm telling you, this bachelor party's
exactly what you need

1:14:05.416 --> 1:14:07.583
to get your mind right
before the wedding, homie.

1:14:07.666 --> 1:14:09.333
I'm so fucking stressed, bro.

1:14:09.416 --> 1:14:10.625
-Oh!
-I can't wait.

1:14:10.708 --> 1:14:14.333
Vegas with the motherfucking squad, nigga.
We gonna have so much fun.

1:14:14.416 --> 1:14:16.666
Bro, I'm gonna do molly
and lick a stripper's toes, man.

1:14:16.750 --> 1:14:18.833
Shit's gonna be lit.

1:14:18.916 --> 1:14:21.291
Hey. What's going on, y'all?

1:14:21.875 --> 1:14:23.750
-Hey, what's up?
-Mm.

1:14:23.833 --> 1:14:24.791
What's up?

1:14:24.875 --> 1:14:27.416
Yeah, man.
Hope it's not a problem me being here.

1:14:27.500 --> 1:14:30.791
You know, I figure I'd tag along.
I brought Omar too.

1:14:30.875 --> 1:14:32.041
What's up, nigga?

1:14:32.583 --> 1:14:33.833
Hey, Omar.

1:14:33.916 --> 1:14:36.875
Yeah, when I found out that Amira

1:14:36.958 --> 1:14:39.958
was gonna take your mother and sister
to Palm Springs with the girls,

1:14:40.041 --> 1:14:43.583
I figured it'd be cool for me
to come hang out with the fellas.

1:14:44.291 --> 1:14:47.166
-Yeah, that's such a good and normal idea.
-Yeah.

1:14:47.250 --> 1:14:48.500
Listen, when we're in Vegas,

1:14:48.583 --> 1:14:50.958
I don't want you thinking
I'm your future father-in-law.

1:14:51.041 --> 1:14:52.208
I'm not that guy.

1:14:52.291 --> 1:14:55.541
I'm just another one of the fellas,
hanging out having a good time.

1:14:55.625 --> 1:14:57.500
Hey, what's your boy's name again?

1:14:58.291 --> 1:15:00.625
Uh, my name's Mo, and I have titties.

1:15:01.250 --> 1:15:03.750
-Oh, I'm sorry, bro-- um, sister-- Mo.
-Mm-hmm.

1:15:03.833 --> 1:15:05.958
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:15:06.041 --> 1:15:08.708
-Can I get my seat?
-I'm sorry about that, yeah.

1:15:09.500 --> 1:15:10.708
We gonna have fun.

1:15:11.250 --> 1:15:12.625
Totally.

1:15:12.708 --> 1:15:14.833
-What the fuck is going on?
-Bro, I don't know.

1:15:14.916 --> 1:15:17.625
But his casual nature
is terrifying, all right?

1:15:17.708 --> 1:15:19.250
He's the type of nigga that'll kill you

1:15:19.333 --> 1:15:21.791
and get a solid nine
and a half hours of sleep.

1:15:21.875 --> 1:15:23.000
I've done that.

1:15:25.750 --> 1:15:26.958
I've done that.

1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.041
Hey, did you know that Mo had titties?

1:15:33.125 --> 1:15:34.500
Yeah, they're on her chest.

1:15:36.708 --> 1:15:38.083
Dude, uh, so what's your plan?

1:15:38.166 --> 1:15:40.333
We catch this kid with the beard
doing weird stupid shit,

1:15:40.416 --> 1:15:42.083
and you just snitch on him
to your daughter?

1:15:42.166 --> 1:15:46.125
No, we gonna just go down there
and make sure he don't have no fun.

1:15:48.708 --> 1:15:51.250
That is very low class of you.

1:15:52.416 --> 1:15:55.333
-But I cannot lie. That is a good plan.
-Hmm.

1:15:55.416 --> 1:15:57.666
Vegas has a knack
for bringing out who people really are.

1:15:57.750 --> 1:16:00.416
-That's right.
-Can tell a lot about a man by his crew.

1:16:00.500 --> 1:16:01.416
That's right.

1:16:03.791 --> 1:16:04.833
-Cheers!
-Shot!

1:16:04.916 --> 1:16:05.875
Shot!

1:16:07.041 --> 1:16:08.041
-Swallow the pill.
-Ahh!

1:16:08.125 --> 1:16:10.500
-All right, this is for my boy.
-Yeah.

1:16:10.583 --> 1:16:13.375
The E to the Z to the motherfucking E.
You know what I'm saying?

1:16:13.458 --> 1:16:15.666
He's trading in his pimp card, boys.

1:16:15.750 --> 1:16:17.583
-Yeah, this one's for me.
-Hell yeah!

1:16:26.791 --> 1:16:28.708
-Hi!
-You glowing and shit.

1:16:28.791 --> 1:16:33.166
Ladies, who's making
all the noise in the lobby?

1:16:35.583 --> 1:16:37.458
-Hey!
-Hi, gorgey!

1:16:37.541 --> 1:16:41.041
-Well, hello, titties! Mwah!

1:16:41.125 --> 1:16:44.125
-Hello, girls!

1:16:47.458 --> 1:16:48.541
Who is this white woman?

1:16:48.625 --> 1:16:49.458
Oh.

1:16:49.541 --> 1:16:54.375
You guys, so this is
Miss Shelley, Ezra's mother.

1:16:54.458 --> 1:16:56.416
-Oh!

1:16:56.500 --> 1:17:00.125
Gosh, you are all so gorgeous.

1:17:00.208 --> 1:17:02.166
-I can't stop staring at you.
-Thank you.

1:17:02.250 --> 1:17:04.500
Honestly, it's like, these earrings

1:17:04.583 --> 1:17:08.166
and the orange business up top.

1:17:08.250 --> 1:17:10.125
-It's just so dope.

1:17:10.208 --> 1:17:12.750
-I can't get over it. And the hair.
-It's dope.

1:17:12.833 --> 1:17:15.458
I mean,
I am straight up simping for all of you.

1:17:15.541 --> 1:17:17.125
-Yeah.

1:17:20.750 --> 1:17:24.500
And that is a beautiful tattoo.

1:17:24.583 --> 1:17:26.958
-Oh, thank you.
-Of course. What does that say?

1:17:27.666 --> 1:17:29.666
It says, "Rest in peace, Big Rev."

1:17:30.291 --> 1:17:31.875
Oh, condolences.

1:17:32.708 --> 1:17:34.250
Yeah, he was my heart.

1:17:36.875 --> 1:17:38.375
Um, I wonder why you didn't put it…

1:17:38.458 --> 1:17:40.958
-…on your other breast. Wha--
-Mom, for the love of God.

1:17:41.041 --> 1:17:43.625
-I'm so sorry.
-Yes.

1:17:43.708 --> 1:17:45.666
For your loss and for my mom.

1:17:45.750 --> 1:17:47.291
-What?

1:18:50.541 --> 1:18:52.625
Ah!

1:18:55.250 --> 1:18:57.083
Hey, let me get this straight.

1:18:57.166 --> 1:19:00.250
Every single person that you know
does coke, but you don't?

1:19:02.083 --> 1:19:04.166
Yeah, it's crazy and upsetting.

1:19:04.250 --> 1:19:07.625
It's… It's driving us apart, honestly.

1:19:08.416 --> 1:19:11.708
I miss them the way they were, you know.

1:19:11.791 --> 1:19:15.875
Yo! Ezra!
Ezra, buddy, buddy. We're almost out.

1:19:15.958 --> 1:19:19.541
So we need your guy's number.
So we need to call the coke guy.

1:19:19.625 --> 1:19:22.750
Your guy, your coke guy.
Can we call him? Thank you.

1:19:22.833 --> 1:19:25.583
What guy? I don't have a guy!

1:19:25.666 --> 1:19:27.625
Ez, what? You definitely have a guy.

1:19:27.708 --> 1:19:30.250
-You got a guy.
-The coke guy from Vegas from last time.

1:19:30.333 --> 1:19:31.750
Just call him. Quit holding out.

1:19:31.833 --> 1:19:34.875
I think you're so high on cocaine,
you don't know what you're saying.

1:19:34.958 --> 1:19:38.791
I don't have a coke guy.

1:19:38.875 --> 1:19:40.166
-No. You have a guy.

1:19:40.250 --> 1:19:41.708
We bought cocaine from him.

1:19:41.791 --> 1:19:43.875
-He is a cocaine dealer.
-Yeah.

1:19:43.958 --> 1:19:45.375
And we bought coke,

1:19:45.458 --> 1:19:48.958
and you got so high that
you ended up passing out on the Strip.

1:19:49.041 --> 1:19:50.750
You had cocaine all over your face.

1:19:51.333 --> 1:19:52.916
Wait, I think I remember you.

1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:55.333
You… You shit your pants last time.

1:19:55.416 --> 1:19:58.458
-Yes, you did! You shit your pants!

1:19:58.541 --> 1:20:01.041
-From cocaine use! You did that.
-Shut the fuck up.

1:20:01.125 --> 1:20:03.875
Sniff, sniff, motherfuckers,
guess who I found.

1:20:03.958 --> 1:20:07.083
-Coke guy!
-Exactly! Ho-ho!

1:20:07.166 --> 1:20:11.041
Ezra! Ezra,
that's the guy I was talking about.

1:20:11.125 --> 1:20:12.250
The coke guy!

1:20:12.333 --> 1:20:14.458
Look. Look, look at his knuckles.

1:20:14.541 --> 1:20:16.875
Yeah, it says "Coke Guy"
right there on his knuckles.

1:20:16.958 --> 1:20:20.416
Ezra! Thank you for
the Edible Arrangement on my birthday.

1:20:20.500 --> 1:20:23.291
Such a mensch. For you, Papi.

1:20:25.208 --> 1:20:29.416
God damn. That's a lot
of cocaine you got there, Ezra.

1:20:30.708 --> 1:20:31.583
Yeah.

1:20:32.583 --> 1:20:35.625
Hey, you shit on yourself
last time you was here?

1:20:36.958 --> 1:20:38.833
You shat your slacks?

1:20:38.916 --> 1:20:41.041
Yes, but not from cocaine.

1:20:41.125 --> 1:20:44.333
It was from… It was from Chipotle.

1:20:47.333 --> 1:20:50.333
-I'm ready. I am ready!
-Oh!

1:20:50.416 --> 1:20:53.375
-Seven letters. Plural.
-Yeah, right.

1:20:53.458 --> 1:20:56.625
A group of people who move beautifully.

1:20:56.708 --> 1:20:59.458
Okay, you said plural, so there's an "s."

1:20:59.541 --> 1:21:00.541
-"S."
-Good.

1:21:00.625 --> 1:21:02.833
-Oh, strippers! Strippers!
-Too many letters.

1:21:04.041 --> 1:21:06.916
Oh, wait. Oh, no, no, no, I've got it.

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:08.666
Is it an "n" word?

1:21:12.958 --> 1:21:13.875
No.

1:21:14.625 --> 1:21:17.125
No, no. I meant N-Navajos.

1:21:17.208 --> 1:21:19.583
-Oh, jeez.
-No, that's where I was going.

1:21:19.666 --> 1:21:21.541
Was Navajos, because, um…

1:21:22.125 --> 1:21:24.416
-You know, when they move, the Navajo--
-Mom.

1:21:24.500 --> 1:21:26.000
Mom, please.

1:21:26.083 --> 1:21:26.916
What?

1:21:27.750 --> 1:21:31.541
-Oh. Dancers!

1:21:32.208 --> 1:21:33.250
Oh, my God!

1:21:33.333 --> 1:21:34.291
What the hell!

1:21:34.375 --> 1:21:35.958
What the hell is wrong with you?

1:21:37.458 --> 1:21:39.208
-Oh, my God!

1:21:40.833 --> 1:21:41.958
No, no!

1:21:42.041 --> 1:21:43.708
It's okay.
Your braids look good.

1:21:43.791 --> 1:21:45.375
It's hooked onto my…

1:21:45.458 --> 1:21:48.291
-It's okay. Somebody get her a wig.

1:21:48.375 --> 1:21:50.916
-Did you know this was a wig?
-No, I… I didn't know that.

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:54.750
I mean, this… this is kind of amazing
craftsmanship, don't you think? Because--

1:21:54.833 --> 1:21:57.500
-Gimme the girl's wig back. Gimme the wig.
-What--

1:21:57.583 --> 1:21:59.458
-Now it's all tangled up.
-You're okay.

1:21:59.541 --> 1:22:01.541
-Let's go!
-Okay.

1:22:01.625 --> 1:22:03.000
We out.

1:22:03.083 --> 1:22:04.291
What ha--

1:22:05.458 --> 1:22:08.500
-Was your trip as bad as mine?
-I guess you could say that.

1:22:08.583 --> 1:22:10.208
Yeah, mine was rough.

1:22:11.625 --> 1:22:13.125
Did your dad say anything?

1:22:13.708 --> 1:22:15.625
No. Why? Should he?

1:22:16.250 --> 1:22:18.916
No, just that, uh, everything went okay,

1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:22.750
and it was totally normal, so, yeah.

1:22:23.375 --> 1:22:25.958
-Okay.
-Why was yours rough? 'Cause my mom?

1:22:26.041 --> 1:22:28.375
I don't wanna talk about it.

1:22:28.458 --> 1:22:29.916
What'd she do this time?

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.750
Ezra, I don't--
I really don't wanna talk about it.

1:22:32.833 --> 1:22:34.291
Just tell me what she did.

1:22:35.208 --> 1:22:39.625
Okay, she pulled the same
tone-deaf shit she does all the time.

1:22:39.708 --> 1:22:41.708
But that's what y'all do, so…

1:22:42.750 --> 1:22:44.416
What type of shit is that to say?

1:22:46.583 --> 1:22:48.583
I'm sorry. I just got a lot on my mind.

1:22:49.125 --> 1:22:50.125
I'm sorry.

1:22:51.958 --> 1:22:54.375
Okay.

1:22:56.625 --> 1:22:58.666
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

1:22:59.375 --> 1:23:01.541
-Throwing this shit away.
-Why?

1:23:01.625 --> 1:23:04.166
Because I didn't get the job, Ezra.
That's why.

1:23:04.833 --> 1:23:05.875
What?

1:23:05.958 --> 1:23:09.583
The producer called me and told me
that he went with someone else.

1:23:09.666 --> 1:23:12.750
Someone who has more
period piece experience. I don't know.

1:23:14.208 --> 1:23:15.250
Baby, I'm sorry.

1:23:15.333 --> 1:23:19.500
If it's any consolation,
I can hold you down for a while.

1:23:19.583 --> 1:23:22.916
No, Ezra,
I don't wanna be some kept woman.

1:23:24.916 --> 1:23:28.166
I'm just trying to think
of ways to help you, all right?

1:23:28.250 --> 1:23:30.666
Like…

1:23:30.750 --> 1:23:31.750
-Let me--

1:23:31.833 --> 1:23:34.000
Let me call
my family friend Rick Greenwald.

1:23:34.083 --> 1:23:35.125
He's got connections,

1:23:35.208 --> 1:23:37.083
and he'll look out
for you on your next job.

1:23:37.166 --> 1:23:38.708
Oh, the fucking luxury.

1:23:39.291 --> 1:23:42.041
Are you not listening to what I'm saying?
Are you not hearing me?

1:23:42.125 --> 1:23:43.875
Everything I have, I've gotten on my own.

1:23:43.958 --> 1:23:45.708
I've worked really hard for it

1:23:45.791 --> 1:23:48.000
and worked through
all this racist bullshit,

1:23:48.083 --> 1:23:49.416
all for you to be able to come in

1:23:49.500 --> 1:23:52.041
and call your family friend
to give me a job

1:23:52.125 --> 1:23:54.291
I probably should have got five years ago?

1:23:54.375 --> 1:23:56.041
How do you think that makes me feel?

1:23:56.916 --> 1:24:00.083
Well, I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
I'm just trying to, like, help.

1:24:00.166 --> 1:24:02.750
And it's okay to accept help
from someone who loves you.

1:24:04.250 --> 1:24:07.541
That's really easy for you to say because
that's how life has worked for you.

1:24:07.625 --> 1:24:09.083
That's not how it works for me.

1:24:09.750 --> 1:24:12.125
Whatever. We have to get ready
for this rehearsal dinner.

1:24:12.208 --> 1:24:14.208
I'm going to the bathroom. Alone.

1:24:14.291 --> 1:24:15.291
Please.

1:24:17.250 --> 1:24:19.583
Yeah, I don't wanna go
to the bathroom with you.

1:24:19.666 --> 1:24:21.083
Since when?

1:24:21.708 --> 1:24:23.291
My charger's in there though.

1:24:24.416 --> 1:24:27.041
Let me just grab my charger
before you're in there for a while.

1:24:27.125 --> 1:24:28.083
Oh, my God!

1:24:28.166 --> 1:24:31.750
-<i>One, two…</i>

1:24:59.291 --> 1:25:02.791
-Woody!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1:25:02.875 --> 1:25:04.875
My name is Akbar Mohammad, bro.

1:25:04.958 --> 1:25:08.166
Oh, man. Mama named you Woody.
I'm calling you Woody.

1:25:08.250 --> 1:25:11.791
Yeah, Mama didn't give birth
to no fake-Versace-wearing,

1:25:11.875 --> 1:25:15.000
PPP-loan-scamming career criminal,
but here we are.

1:25:15.083 --> 1:25:16.375
This is Versace.

1:25:16.458 --> 1:25:17.875
Nigga, please.

1:25:17.958 --> 1:25:19.583
Anyway, I ain't no criminal, okay?

1:25:19.666 --> 1:25:22.166
It was a peeping Tom charge, okay?

1:25:22.250 --> 1:25:25.791
I was looking in there, peeping to see
if my baby mama was cheating,

1:25:25.875 --> 1:25:29.000
so I could get lower prices
on my child support.

1:25:29.083 --> 1:25:30.375
Why peep through the window?

1:25:30.458 --> 1:25:34.458
Because I wanted to see somebody
have her broke down over, like a shotgun.

1:25:34.541 --> 1:25:36.250
That ain't gonna lower your child support.

1:25:36.333 --> 1:25:39.208
The judge seen her being a ho,
my child support will go low.

1:25:39.291 --> 1:25:41.875
Can't go up in the judge,
"I seen her bent over, Your Honor."

1:25:41.958 --> 1:25:42.916
"I should get less."

1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:45.458
The judge ain't gonna
give you less money.

1:25:45.541 --> 1:25:46.958
I've done it before.

1:25:47.041 --> 1:25:49.083
-Hi, Uncle EJ.
-Hey, baby!

1:25:49.166 --> 1:25:51.416
Hey!

1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:54.791
This is Ezra. Ezra, this my Uncle EJ.

1:25:55.375 --> 1:25:57.416
-What's up, Ez? What'd you say, Ez--
-Ezra.

1:25:57.500 --> 1:25:59.750
-Famous Uncle EJ. Heard a lot about you.
-This is my uncle.

1:25:59.833 --> 1:26:00.708
Okay.

1:26:00.791 --> 1:26:03.125
Yeah, this is Ezra. This is the man.

1:26:03.791 --> 1:26:05.375
-My man, all right.

1:26:05.458 --> 1:26:08.208
Okay, I'm gonna go say what's up to Renee.

1:26:08.291 --> 1:26:09.458
-Yeah.
-Y'all be nice.

1:26:09.541 --> 1:26:10.625
We'll be nice to Ezra.

1:26:10.708 --> 1:26:13.416
You gonna let this credit card sit here,
we gonna swipe him.

1:26:14.416 --> 1:26:17.375
He look like an AmEx,
standing here with his hair slicked back.

1:26:17.458 --> 1:26:19.333
-Oh. He lying.

1:26:19.416 --> 1:26:20.958
-All right.
-All right. Okay.

1:26:21.041 --> 1:26:22.708
Come back soon if you want.

1:26:22.791 --> 1:26:26.625
-Ezra does a podcast on Black culture.
-Oh!

1:26:27.875 --> 1:26:28.958
Tell him, Ezra.

1:26:29.041 --> 1:26:30.458
Yeah, I do podcasts.

1:26:31.041 --> 1:26:32.250
About what?

1:26:32.958 --> 1:26:33.875
The culture.

1:26:34.458 --> 1:26:36.708
Oh, you're gonna just say "culture"
and leave "Black" out?

1:26:37.291 --> 1:26:40.458
You gotta get that money
some kind of way, baby, huh?

1:26:40.541 --> 1:26:43.916
Give me $150 real quick.
Don't tell her I asked for the money.

1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:45.791
-I won't. I'll Venmo--
-Give me a Cîroc.

1:26:45.875 --> 1:26:49.583
And, uh, the white Barry White
something to drink.

1:26:55.333 --> 1:26:58.208
-Cheers!

1:27:04.291 --> 1:27:06.416
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I got something to say.

1:27:06.500 --> 1:27:08.375
-I got something to say. Uh…
-Okay, say it!

1:27:08.458 --> 1:27:11.166
This is nice, y'all. This is real nice.

1:27:11.250 --> 1:27:14.583
I ain't never had
no, uh, wedding like this,

1:27:14.666 --> 1:27:17.125
but I mean, I've been married three times.
That's right.

1:27:17.208 --> 1:27:19.125
Two times at the courthouse

1:27:19.208 --> 1:27:21.916
and then one time
at the Benihana's. 

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.083
We ain't had no reservations,
nothing like that.

1:27:24.166 --> 1:27:28.125
Amira, my cousin, I just wanna say
how happy I am for you and Ezra--

1:27:28.208 --> 1:27:31.833
Girl, we just wanna say congrats.
You marrying this white man.

1:27:31.916 --> 1:27:34.166
-Girl, all these white people are here.

1:27:34.250 --> 1:27:37.375
If you like it, we love it,
right?

1:27:37.458 --> 1:27:40.000
-I stormed the Capitol.

1:27:40.083 --> 1:27:42.416
I did. I was there.

1:27:43.125 --> 1:27:45.208
Ezra tried to stop me.

1:27:47.166 --> 1:27:49.375
He's a liberal cuck, but he's a good man.

1:27:49.458 --> 1:27:52.791
To my best friend Ezra,
who's kind and thoughtful,

1:27:53.375 --> 1:27:56.666
but for whatever reason didn't think
to sit me on the Black side of the table,

1:27:56.750 --> 1:27:59.791
which just aesthetically
makes sense, you know.

1:27:59.875 --> 1:28:04.208
Cheers to inclusion
and our newly found generational wealth.

1:28:04.291 --> 1:28:06.916
"He left the family early, um,

1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:10.958
leaving his mother responsible
for everybody, including the house."

1:28:12.166 --> 1:28:14.458
"And after Mom died in 1984,

1:28:14.541 --> 1:28:17.625
Xzibit had no choice

1:28:17.708 --> 1:28:20.000
but to move in back
with his father in New Mexico."

1:28:20.083 --> 1:28:23.208
I… I wanna say…
I wanna say it was Albuquerque.

1:28:23.291 --> 1:28:26.208
-Okay. I think we can wrap it up. Yeah.
-I think.

1:28:26.291 --> 1:28:27.666
That vaccine…

1:28:31.083 --> 1:28:32.666
makes you gay.

1:28:32.750 --> 1:28:34.541
So the moral of the story is

1:28:34.625 --> 1:28:37.458
never date a woman
who don't respect your wife.

1:28:39.166 --> 1:28:42.708
No, I didn't mean to--
I said the wrong shit.

1:28:52.791 --> 1:28:54.416
Can I have everybody's attention, please?

1:28:55.166 --> 1:28:56.375
Attention, everyone.

1:28:57.125 --> 1:28:58.625
Yeah, I know it's, uh,

1:28:58.708 --> 1:29:01.791
it's customary for the father
to give a speech on the wedding day.

1:29:02.500 --> 1:29:06.458
But I thought there was some things
that I needed to, uh, address tonight.

1:29:07.500 --> 1:29:08.583
Um,

1:29:09.083 --> 1:29:10.833
when a man's daughter gets married,

1:29:11.916 --> 1:29:14.500
they say that the man is giving her away.

1:29:15.541 --> 1:29:18.375
Now, that's a really hard pill to swallow.

1:29:19.500 --> 1:29:21.000
Because you don't usually know

1:29:21.083 --> 1:29:23.958
who the man is
that you're giving your daughter away to.

1:29:24.958 --> 1:29:25.916
Usually.

1:29:27.708 --> 1:29:29.291
But I consider myself fortunate,

1:29:29.375 --> 1:29:32.500
because I think
I kind of do know who Ezra is.

1:29:34.083 --> 1:29:39.916
And he's not a drunken, drugged-out,
dream-chasing whore monger

1:29:40.958 --> 1:29:44.375
who surrounds himself
with a bunch of, uh, racist degenerates.

1:29:48.375 --> 1:29:49.750
I didn't get that guy.

1:29:51.541 --> 1:29:53.500
I got <i>this </i>guy.

1:29:53.583 --> 1:29:55.750
-Mmm. Aww.

1:29:55.833 --> 1:29:57.333
All right, okay, okay.

1:29:57.958 --> 1:30:00.875
So, here's to my beautiful baby girl.

1:30:00.958 --> 1:30:03.541
-Cheers!
-We love you.

1:30:04.125 --> 1:30:05.833
Congratulations!

1:30:23.125 --> 1:30:24.125
Thank you, sir.

1:30:24.875 --> 1:30:25.708
Hey.

1:30:27.541 --> 1:30:29.916
Oh, Ezra.

1:30:32.750 --> 1:30:34.916
Thank you for,
uh, what you did back there.

1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:36.583
What did I do back there?

1:30:38.416 --> 1:30:39.333
Your speech.

1:30:39.416 --> 1:30:42.416
You could've, uh,
could've blown up my spot.

1:30:42.500 --> 1:30:43.958
You didn't, so thanks.

1:30:44.041 --> 1:30:47.166
Well, save your thank you,
'cause I didn't do it for you.

1:30:47.250 --> 1:30:48.958
I did that for my daughter.

1:30:49.041 --> 1:30:51.791
You think I'm gonna embarrass her
in front of her whole family?

1:30:52.458 --> 1:30:53.375
No.

1:30:55.291 --> 1:30:56.708
You don't know me too well.

1:30:58.291 --> 1:31:00.791
But here's the thing. I know you.

1:31:01.916 --> 1:31:03.750
I've known you from the very start.

1:31:03.833 --> 1:31:05.750
I had your number from day one.

1:31:06.875 --> 1:31:07.875
And for the life of me,

1:31:07.958 --> 1:31:11.458
I do not know why my daughter
continues to go down this path with you.

1:31:12.041 --> 1:31:14.208
There's one thing
that I'm crystal clear on,

1:31:14.291 --> 1:31:20.666
is that you are absolutely,
positively, unequivocally

1:31:21.500 --> 1:31:23.958
not the right the guy for my daughter.

1:31:24.583 --> 1:31:25.583
Period.

1:31:25.666 --> 1:31:27.750
-Why?
-Excuse me.

1:31:27.833 --> 1:31:29.958
Why am I not
the right guy for your daughter?

1:31:30.041 --> 1:31:31.791
Well, shit, where do I begin?

1:31:31.875 --> 1:31:32.708
Anywhere.

1:31:34.250 --> 1:31:36.708
Well, what… what about
we start at your bachelor party?

1:31:36.791 --> 1:31:39.250
When I saw you in the room
with the strippers and the cocaine,

1:31:39.333 --> 1:31:40.750
how about we start there?

1:31:40.833 --> 1:31:41.916
Why don't we start with

1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:44.250
why you were at my bachelor party
in the first place?

1:31:44.916 --> 1:31:46.166
You had no right to be there.

1:31:46.250 --> 1:31:47.958
Bachelor parties are
for people to be weird.

1:31:48.041 --> 1:31:49.500
That's not who I am.

1:31:49.583 --> 1:31:51.416
Okay? It's my dumb fucking friends.

1:31:52.041 --> 1:31:54.375
But you deeboed your way in,
and you got what you wanted.

1:31:54.458 --> 1:31:55.916
I had a shitty time.

1:31:56.708 --> 1:32:00.500
As a matter of fact, I have a shitty time
whenever you're around.

1:32:00.583 --> 1:32:03.500
You're like the cooler to my life,
and I don't know why.

1:32:04.083 --> 1:32:07.125
Because the truth is all I've ever done

1:32:08.541 --> 1:32:10.041
is love your daughter,

1:32:10.583 --> 1:32:12.708
wholly and completely.

1:32:13.500 --> 1:32:15.083
And she loves me,

1:32:15.166 --> 1:32:17.083
and we wanna marry each other.

1:32:17.166 --> 1:32:20.208
And you just decided
before you even met me

1:32:20.291 --> 1:32:21.791
that you hated me.

1:32:22.416 --> 1:32:24.625
And then once you met me,
you put all your energy

1:32:24.708 --> 1:32:26.958
just towards, like, smoking me out

1:32:27.041 --> 1:32:29.500
or trying to prove
I don't belong around Black people,

1:32:29.583 --> 1:32:32.041
or that I'm a researcher
and not a witness.

1:32:32.666 --> 1:32:35.583
That's why you brought me
to play ball at that park.

1:32:35.666 --> 1:32:37.291
Why you brought me to that Crip barbershop

1:32:37.375 --> 1:32:39.208
while I'm wearing a red hoodie
like an idiot.

1:32:39.291 --> 1:32:43.125
It's why you fuck with me about my podcast
and my music taste and how I talk

1:32:43.208 --> 1:32:44.916
and how I think and who my friends are

1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:47.125
and basically
everything that I'm a part of.

1:32:48.166 --> 1:32:50.333
And I just take it. I take it!

1:32:50.416 --> 1:32:52.833
I take your shit. I take it all day.

1:32:53.833 --> 1:32:56.541
And it did teach me one thing
that you were right about.

1:32:56.625 --> 1:32:57.583
And what's that?

1:32:58.166 --> 1:33:02.166
I will never, ever, ever

1:33:03.291 --> 1:33:06.125
know what it's like
to be a Black person in this country.

1:33:07.333 --> 1:33:09.500
But I do know what an asshole is.

1:33:17.875 --> 1:33:19.291
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1:33:19.375 --> 1:33:22.666
I'm really pleased with the way--
and they're such a nice group of--

1:33:22.750 --> 1:33:26.083
Oh, Amira! Amira. Hi!

1:33:26.166 --> 1:33:28.083
Would you excuse me for just a second?

1:33:28.166 --> 1:33:30.083
-Oh, my gosh!
-Hi.

1:33:30.166 --> 1:33:32.500
Hi! I just wanted to stop you

1:33:32.583 --> 1:33:34.583
and tell you
that I think you look so pretty.

1:33:34.666 --> 1:33:35.750
Thank you.

1:33:36.333 --> 1:33:37.625
Is that a roller set?

1:33:37.708 --> 1:33:40.666
-Hmm?
-Your hair. Is it a roller set?

1:33:41.583 --> 1:33:43.666
Um, no, it's not.

1:33:43.750 --> 1:33:48.708
Oh. Shoot. Okay.
It's not individuals, right?

1:33:48.791 --> 1:33:49.750
No.

1:33:49.833 --> 1:33:52.291
No? Okay. Shit.

1:33:52.375 --> 1:33:55.416
All right, well, I guess I'm gonna
have to go back to the drawing board.

1:33:55.500 --> 1:33:58.000
I, uh-- Ever since the bachelorette party…

1:33:58.083 --> 1:33:58.916
Mm-hmm.

1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:02.708
…I just did this really deep dive
on Black women's hair.

1:34:02.791 --> 1:34:06.583
And, um, oh, for example,
I watched the Chris Rock documentary.

1:34:06.666 --> 1:34:10.041
I don't know if you've had a chance
to see it. It's absolutely fantastic.

1:34:10.125 --> 1:34:11.458
And he's so funny.

1:34:11.541 --> 1:34:13.916
There's something about his voice
that always makes me laugh.

1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:16.916
But anyway, there's nothing funny
about Black women's hair, you know.

1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:20.833
I mean, my God, I just had no idea.

1:34:20.916 --> 1:34:22.875
I mean, it really blew my mind.

1:34:22.958 --> 1:34:25.458
You know, the energy and the time

1:34:25.541 --> 1:34:29.750
and the… the pain and the suffering
that Black women go through.

1:34:29.833 --> 1:34:33.000
And so, anyway,
I just wanted to be well-versed

1:34:33.083 --> 1:34:36.125
for when I saw you next,
and I'll let you get back to it.

1:34:36.750 --> 1:34:39.333
Yeah, and-- but before you go,
can you just tell me…

1:34:39.958 --> 1:34:42.666
What is this style?
Just so I know for next time.

1:34:42.750 --> 1:34:44.833
-Shelley, I'm not a toy.
-Because I--

1:34:45.583 --> 1:34:46.500
Hmm?

1:34:46.583 --> 1:34:49.500
I really don't appreciate you treating me

1:34:49.583 --> 1:34:53.083
like some shiny little object
you can show off to your friends.

1:34:53.166 --> 1:34:54.916
Oh, no,
I would never do anything like that.

1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:56.083
-No, you are.
-No--

1:34:56.166 --> 1:34:58.750
-Just let me finish. Yes, you do.
-Oh, no, I--

1:34:58.833 --> 1:35:02.458
Since I met you,
I've been nothing but kind and respectful.

1:35:02.541 --> 1:35:03.791
And it's starting to feel like

1:35:03.875 --> 1:35:06.416
you're all happy
that you have this Black daughter-in-law

1:35:06.500 --> 1:35:09.041
now that it's cool
to care about Black people.

1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:13.083
I bet every time we hang out,
you tell one of your friends,

1:35:13.166 --> 1:35:15.666
and I can guarantee you
that what you don't tell them

1:35:15.750 --> 1:35:17.250
is that every time we hang out,

1:35:17.333 --> 1:35:21.875
you are wildly offensive
and incredibly inappropriate.

1:35:23.500 --> 1:35:25.583
-Well, I'm not--
-Oh, and now you're gonna cry.

1:35:25.666 --> 1:35:27.708
You're gonna clutch your pearls
and play the victim

1:35:27.791 --> 1:35:30.083
as if everything I just said,
none of that was valid.

1:35:30.166 --> 1:35:31.875
My feelings are not valid.

1:35:31.958 --> 1:35:33.291
Your feelings are hurt.

1:35:33.375 --> 1:35:35.250
-Am I being too aggressive with you?

1:35:35.333 --> 1:35:37.000
Am I giving you "angry"?

1:35:38.083 --> 1:35:41.708
The crazy thing is that I really
genuinely wanted to get to know you,

1:35:41.791 --> 1:35:42.750
woman to woman.

1:35:42.833 --> 1:35:44.250
I thought you would see me.

1:35:44.333 --> 1:35:46.833
-That's what I--
-No, it's not.

1:35:47.375 --> 1:35:49.625
Because you can't just see me for me.

1:35:50.125 --> 1:35:51.708
It doesn't matter how many books you read

1:35:51.791 --> 1:35:54.333
or how many documentaries that you watch,

1:35:54.416 --> 1:35:57.750
because at the end of the day,
I won't just be Amira to you.

1:35:57.833 --> 1:36:01.041
I'll always be Amira,
the Black token daughter-in-law,

1:36:01.125 --> 1:36:02.541
and that's ignorant.

1:36:03.375 --> 1:36:05.125
Amira, are you okay?

1:36:05.208 --> 1:36:06.041
Not really.

1:36:07.500 --> 1:36:09.500
-Miss Shelley, are you okay?
-Mm-hmm.

1:36:10.125 --> 1:36:13.250
All right. Uh, Amira, honey.

1:36:21.833 --> 1:36:23.583
Can I talk to you for a second?

1:36:23.666 --> 1:36:24.583
Yes.

1:36:28.958 --> 1:36:30.375
You wanna go first?

1:36:31.041 --> 1:36:34.958
-I do, but it sounds like you do too.
-I do.

1:36:38.625 --> 1:36:39.625
Ezra…

1:36:44.166 --> 1:36:46.916
I don't know how this is gonna work.

1:36:49.541 --> 1:36:50.375
Okay.

1:36:51.291 --> 1:36:52.375
It's just…

1:36:53.583 --> 1:36:56.208
You know, your family,

1:36:56.291 --> 1:36:59.166
my family, the whole thing,

1:36:59.250 --> 1:37:02.958
I don't know
if it's supposed to be this hard,

1:37:03.041 --> 1:37:05.291
and if I'm being honest, I just…

1:37:06.208 --> 1:37:08.416
Oh, God, I don't have it in me.

1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:12.416
I'm so sorry.

1:37:21.875 --> 1:37:23.500
Uh, I don't disagree.

1:37:26.083 --> 1:37:28.458
The stuff with our families, like…

1:37:30.708 --> 1:37:32.083
my mom, your dad.

1:37:33.833 --> 1:37:36.375
Yeah, I guess I don't see it changing, so…

1:37:40.083 --> 1:37:43.250
I do, uh, I do want you to know that,

1:37:44.375 --> 1:37:48.500
uh, this time with you has been,
like, the happiest time of my life, so…

1:37:55.250 --> 1:37:57.583
I feel the same way.

1:38:07.375 --> 1:38:08.375
Okay.

1:38:31.500 --> 1:38:33.458
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>about something you said.</i>

1:38:33.541 --> 1:38:36.291
<i>Nigga, if I had a dollar</i>
<i>for every time I heard that one.</i>

1:38:36.375 --> 1:38:38.708
<i>You're extremely unlikable.</i>
<i>You know that, right?</i>

1:38:39.500 --> 1:38:41.166
-What?
-Whoa-ho!

1:38:42.500 --> 1:38:44.083
-Yee-hee!
-Oh, my!

1:38:44.166 --> 1:38:46.083
Anyways, what did I say

1:38:46.166 --> 1:38:49.250
that's been profoundly
rattling around in your consciousness?

1:38:49.333 --> 1:38:52.125
You said that Black people
and white people could never be cool,

1:38:52.208 --> 1:38:53.708
and I think you're right.

1:38:53.791 --> 1:38:56.416
Yeah, bro, of course I was right.

1:38:56.500 --> 1:38:57.750
I'm always right.

1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.708
<i>Is that what's bothering you?</i>
<i>That I'm always right?</i>

1:39:02.791 --> 1:39:07.125
<i>No, what's bothering me is,</i>
<i>for a second, I believed you were wrong.</i>

1:39:07.208 --> 1:39:10.333
<i>That there was hope for us.</i>
<i>For the future.</i>

1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:16.750
<i>That when two people from</i>
<i>two different walks of life came together,</i>

1:39:16.833 --> 1:39:19.541
<i>they could get by</i>
<i>on their compassion for one another</i>

1:39:19.625 --> 1:39:21.833
<i>and their curiosity and their love.</i>

1:39:36.583 --> 1:39:39.458
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>
<i>when it comes to Black and white people,</i>

1:39:39.541 --> 1:39:41.125
<i>I don't think love is enough.</i>

1:39:41.791 --> 1:39:44.125
<i>There's too many other outside factors.</i>

1:39:48.041 --> 1:39:50.375
<i>Whether it be your friends or your family,</i>

1:39:50.458 --> 1:39:53.208
<i>people can't accept</i>
<i>what they don't understand.</i>

1:39:53.916 --> 1:39:57.958
<i>Whether it's right is one thing,</i>
<i>but factually, it's true.</i>

1:39:58.541 --> 1:40:00.583
<i>We really do live in two worlds.</i>

1:40:01.291 --> 1:40:02.750
<i>There's no escaping it.</i>

1:40:07.875 --> 1:40:09.041
<i>I was raised by hip-hop shit.</i>

1:40:09.125 --> 1:40:11.791
<i>It's made me who I am, but even with that,</i>

1:40:11.875 --> 1:40:15.708
<i>I still wasn't prepared for the realities</i>
<i>of a world I'm just not from.</i>

1:40:15.791 --> 1:40:17.750
<i>I'll always be an outsider.</i>

1:40:17.833 --> 1:40:20.208
<i>Which is why, as fucked up as this sounds,</i>

1:40:20.291 --> 1:40:22.875
<i>I feel like if you love something,</i>

1:40:22.958 --> 1:40:25.208
<i>as much as you</i>
<i>wanna share it with everybody,</i>

1:40:25.291 --> 1:40:27.208
<i>I think it's best</i>
<i>you keep it for yourself.</i>

1:40:27.291 --> 1:40:30.541
See, I told you. The white Barry White,
he be spitting some shit!

1:40:31.416 --> 1:40:32.666
Him and Joe Rogan.

1:40:33.666 --> 1:40:36.250
I ain't mad at Joe Rogan
for saying "nigga" every other word,

1:40:36.333 --> 1:40:38.791
long as he don't say that shit in my face.

1:40:38.875 --> 1:40:41.041
<i>To make a relationship work,</i>
<i>it's the hardest thing…</i>

1:40:41.125 --> 1:40:43.250
Man, you kind of
dragged bruh a little bit.

1:40:43.833 --> 1:40:45.791
What are you talking about? Ezra?
I ain't drag him.

1:40:45.875 --> 1:40:47.958
You drug him like a fat bitch's left foot.

1:40:48.041 --> 1:40:51.583
No, no, no, no, no,
you can miss me with all that shit.

1:40:51.666 --> 1:40:54.083
I did exactly what any father would do.

1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:56.625
You played him
like a white boy,

1:40:56.708 --> 1:40:59.375
'cause you knew you could
get away with it. Tell the truth!

1:40:59.458 --> 1:41:01.500
Oh, you would've handled it differently?

1:41:01.583 --> 1:41:03.375
I would've got a car out of his ass.

1:41:03.458 --> 1:41:06.083
I'd have probably
started me a line of credit,

1:41:06.166 --> 1:41:08.375
probably got me a washer and dryer,

1:41:08.458 --> 1:41:09.875
probably a bottle of cologne.

1:41:10.583 --> 1:41:12.291
Try to get my back patio done.

1:41:12.375 --> 1:41:14.166
This is the stuff
that he probably wanna do.

1:41:14.250 --> 1:41:15.625
You in your own reality, huh?

1:41:15.708 --> 1:41:17.208
That shit ain't gonna happen.

1:41:17.750 --> 1:41:20.000
It don't matter what I would've did.

1:41:20.083 --> 1:41:22.333
Times have changed.
The world is different, Woody.

1:41:22.916 --> 1:41:25.458
Akbar, bitch. My name is Akbar.

1:41:25.541 --> 1:41:27.833
-It's the same amount of syllables--
-See? See?

1:41:28.666 --> 1:41:30.250
You didn't see what I saw.

1:41:30.791 --> 1:41:34.458
Him and his friends, the degenerates,
was doing so much cocaine in Vegas,

1:41:34.541 --> 1:41:36.583
it looked like
they was doing a reboot of <i>Scarface.</i>

1:41:37.166 --> 1:41:39.708
So that's what it's about? Cocaine?

1:41:39.791 --> 1:41:41.791
Yes, that's one of the main reasons.
Yes, cocaine.

1:41:41.875 --> 1:41:44.166
He was doing not just cocaine.
Lots of cocaine.

1:41:44.250 --> 1:41:47.458
It was copious amounts
of cocaine, everywhere.

1:41:47.541 --> 1:41:50.541
He did so much cocaine,
he shit on hisself!

1:41:50.625 --> 1:41:53.500
-You seen him shit on hisself?
-No, I ain't see him shit on hisself.

1:41:53.583 --> 1:41:56.708
But I heard about the other time
when he was there and he shit on hisself,

1:41:56.791 --> 1:41:58.250
and everybody still talks about it.

1:41:58.333 --> 1:42:00.666
-So the whole town knows.

1:42:00.750 --> 1:42:03.416
How we gonna be falling
in the spot with this nigga?

1:42:04.375 --> 1:42:05.291
Wow.

1:42:06.750 --> 1:42:10.375
Look, I'm not saying it's right,
but you did your shit back in the day.

1:42:11.500 --> 1:42:14.583
You remember they came out with
the <i>Cold Blooded</i> Rick James album?

1:42:15.166 --> 1:42:18.083
No, I don't remember
the <i>Cold Blooded</i> Rick James album.

1:42:18.166 --> 1:42:19.375
Okay, but coke do.

1:42:21.083 --> 1:42:22.791
Man, we loved that album.

1:42:22.875 --> 1:42:25.375
That was the only time
I felt related to you.

1:42:26.750 --> 1:42:28.333
And I think you shorted him a little bit.

1:42:28.416 --> 1:42:30.458
Yeah, you… you shorted him.

1:42:31.041 --> 1:42:33.375
And… And you shorted Amira.

1:42:34.208 --> 1:42:35.500
Shorted both of 'em.

1:43:08.416 --> 1:43:10.333
Can you please stop smiling so big?

1:43:10.416 --> 1:43:11.916
-You're freaking out the locals.
-What?

1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:15.708
Well, I'm excited that my son
is gonna buy me some tennis shoes.

1:43:15.791 --> 1:43:18.583
I just don't understand
why all of a sudden

1:43:18.666 --> 1:43:20.166
you need a pair of Dunks so badly.

1:43:20.250 --> 1:43:23.166
Because Diane Kaplan's son
bought her a pair of tennis shoes

1:43:23.250 --> 1:43:25.375
and the bitch won't stop talking about it.

1:43:26.875 --> 1:43:28.083
Oh, shit.

1:43:28.166 --> 1:43:29.166
What?

1:43:30.791 --> 1:43:34.458
Oh, well, that's cool. We can just go in
and get the shoes, doesn't matter.

1:43:34.541 --> 1:43:37.000
I think you gotta let Diane one up you
on this one, Mom.

1:43:37.083 --> 1:43:38.875
-I don't really wanna--
-It's…

1:43:38.958 --> 1:43:39.916
Ezra?

1:43:42.041 --> 1:43:44.333
Oh, uh, Amira, what's up, girl?

1:43:45.250 --> 1:43:46.291
Mm. "What's up, girl"?

1:43:46.375 --> 1:43:49.041
Why are you sounding
like LL Cool J? What's up?

1:43:50.083 --> 1:43:52.875
Sorry, I just wasn't expecting
to run into you here.

1:43:53.375 --> 1:43:55.166
I mean, yeah, same.

1:44:00.291 --> 1:44:01.500
Daddy, what's going on?

1:44:01.583 --> 1:44:03.041
Oh, fuck me.

1:44:03.125 --> 1:44:04.208
Good timing.

1:44:04.291 --> 1:44:07.750
Yeah. Okay, I didn't
bring you here to buy me shoes.

1:44:07.833 --> 1:44:09.500
-Yeah, starting to put that together.
-Yeah.

1:44:09.583 --> 1:44:12.416
Yeah, and, baby girl, I don't know
what I told you to get you down here,

1:44:12.500 --> 1:44:14.166
but whatever it was, it was a lie.

1:44:14.250 --> 1:44:17.041
The truth is
Shelley and I have been talking.

1:44:17.583 --> 1:44:19.875
Yep. Uh, we screwed up, you guys.

1:44:19.958 --> 1:44:20.958
-Badly.
-Yeah.

1:44:21.041 --> 1:44:23.833
And we feel
like we owe y'all some apologies.

1:44:23.916 --> 1:44:24.750
Mm-hmm.

1:44:24.833 --> 1:44:27.500
-Can I go first?
-Yeah, please, go, go.

1:44:27.583 --> 1:44:28.458
Ezra.

1:44:30.208 --> 1:44:31.041
Brother.

1:44:32.291 --> 1:44:33.291
Man, listen.

1:44:33.375 --> 1:44:37.041
I been riding your back
from the moment we first met,

1:44:37.625 --> 1:44:38.750
and I'm sorry.

1:44:39.333 --> 1:44:40.875
'Cause you didn't deserve that.

1:44:41.375 --> 1:44:43.458
It's just I couldn't handle the fact
that you weren't

1:44:43.541 --> 1:44:46.833
what we ever thought Amira
would bring home and, uh, you know…

1:44:47.958 --> 1:44:51.583
And I never ever thought
that I could see my reflection in you, so…

1:44:52.333 --> 1:44:53.250
But I do.

1:44:54.041 --> 1:44:55.375
And you're a good man.

1:44:56.375 --> 1:44:57.708
And a hustler.

1:44:58.291 --> 1:45:00.583
And most importantly,

1:45:00.666 --> 1:45:05.125
we both love Amira very much,
and we'll do anything to make her happy.

1:45:09.666 --> 1:45:11.916
Okay, it's my turn.

1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:13.541
Um, Amira.

1:45:13.625 --> 1:45:19.041
I am so sorry
for everything that I did

1:45:19.666 --> 1:45:22.208
and said that was offensive to you.

1:45:22.291 --> 1:45:25.208
The truth is I… I was just lost.

1:45:25.291 --> 1:45:29.375
You know, my son came home
with this beautiful, amazing woman,

1:45:29.458 --> 1:45:31.791
and I didn't know
anything about her world.

1:45:31.875 --> 1:45:33.166
I mean, I thought I did.

1:45:33.250 --> 1:45:37.208
And I was just so excited to have
a new and different culture in our family,

1:45:37.291 --> 1:45:40.375
and I just hope
that you accept my apology,

1:45:40.458 --> 1:45:43.958
because I do apologize
on behalf of all white people.

1:45:44.041 --> 1:45:47.041
Except for the racist ones,
the actual racist ones.

1:45:47.125 --> 1:45:49.750
-And on behalf of all Jewish people.

1:45:50.333 --> 1:45:51.791
Except for Aunt Mitzi because…

1:45:51.875 --> 1:45:53.750
-Yeah, she's racist.
-She's actually racist.

1:45:53.833 --> 1:45:56.250
She's a horrible human being.

1:45:56.916 --> 1:45:59.291
But really mostly on behalf of me,

1:45:59.375 --> 1:46:01.583
Shelley Cohen of Brentwood, California.

1:46:02.208 --> 1:46:04.708
I am so sorry, Amira,

1:46:04.791 --> 1:46:08.125
because I love you and you are not a toy.

1:46:08.750 --> 1:46:12.625
I see you as the real, powerful,

1:46:12.708 --> 1:46:15.750
individual person that you are.

1:46:19.333 --> 1:46:22.500
Thank you so much, Miss Shelley,
that means a lot to me.

1:46:22.583 --> 1:46:23.833
And I fully receive that.

1:46:23.916 --> 1:46:26.666
It felt very genuine and sincere,

1:46:26.750 --> 1:46:28.166
so thank you so much.

1:46:28.750 --> 1:46:29.750
And, Ezzy.

1:46:30.291 --> 1:46:33.833
I'm also sorry
for always getting in the way.

1:46:33.916 --> 1:46:34.875
No, you're not.

1:46:34.958 --> 1:46:37.250
I'm not, honey, but I love you.

1:46:37.333 --> 1:46:39.875
-Yeah. I love you too.
-I love you, baby, very much.

1:46:39.958 --> 1:46:41.083
Okay, so…

1:46:41.875 --> 1:46:44.916
Akbar and I had a little idea.

1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:48.125
Yes, and we think
you're both gonna like it very much.

1:46:48.208 --> 1:46:49.166
A lot.

1:46:52.916 --> 1:46:56.625
So, did you miss me
as much as I missed you?

1:46:59.250 --> 1:47:00.875
I missed you so much.

1:47:02.416 --> 1:47:06.083
I even got a pair of slides the other day
'cause I wanted to feel close to you.

1:47:06.166 --> 1:47:08.833
-Eww!
-They were Umbros. It was all they had.

1:47:08.916 --> 1:47:10.083
-I know.
-No.

1:47:10.166 --> 1:47:12.375
-I got 'em 'cause I was so sad.
-Aww.

1:47:13.791 --> 1:47:16.416
-Missed you.
-I missed you too.

1:47:43.416 --> 1:47:45.625
This is great!

1:47:45.708 --> 1:47:46.875
I love you.

1:47:46.958 --> 1:47:48.916
Aww!

1:47:57.083 --> 1:47:59.875
Blessings to all who are present

1:47:59.958 --> 1:48:03.041
to witness Ezra and Amira
unite their lives in marriage.

1:48:03.125 --> 1:48:04.375
Two hearts as one.

1:48:04.458 --> 1:48:08.666
Ezra and Amira,
you choose each other to build a home,

1:48:08.750 --> 1:48:12.583
not of brick and mortar, but a home
and haven in your hearts together.

1:48:12.666 --> 1:48:15.375
May it be fulfilled each day

1:48:15.458 --> 1:48:18.583
as you are
on this beautiful journey of love.

1:48:22.083 --> 1:48:23.291
Aww!

1:48:24.208 --> 1:48:25.833
Just a little heavy on the tongue.

1:48:25.916 --> 1:48:27.666
Most white people do.

1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:52.083
Oh!

1:48:55.875 --> 1:48:58.083
Can you believe this is happening?

1:48:58.166 --> 1:49:00.208
Yep!

1:49:00.291 --> 1:49:01.791
Wow. They look so happy, huh?

1:49:01.875 --> 1:49:04.666
-Yeah, they do.

1:49:04.750 --> 1:49:06.666
Mr. and Mrs. Cohen.

1:49:06.750 --> 1:49:08.916
Mr. and Mrs. Mohammad-Cohen.

1:49:09.791 --> 1:49:10.625
Yep.

1:49:10.708 --> 1:49:11.833
Ain't that a bitch!
