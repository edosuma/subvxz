WEBVTT

00:08.400 --> 00:11.033
WHY ARE THEY SENDING ME
THESE CATALOGS?

00:11.033 --> 00:15.400
"GERIATRIC DISCOUNT
WAREHOUSE"?

00:15.400 --> 00:18.500
THIS ISN'T
VICTORIA'S SECRET.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.400
"WHAT'S NEW
IN LIFE SUPPORT"?

00:20.400 --> 00:23.800
HOW DID I GET
ON THIS MAILING LIST?

00:23.800 --> 00:25.667
DID YOU SEND AWAY
FOR SOMETHING?

00:25.667 --> 00:31.100
NO--MAYBE I SENT AWAY
FOR SOME HIGH-POTENCY
VITAMIN E.

00:31.100 --> 00:32.400
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

00:32.400 --> 00:33.600
FOR YOU.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
IT'S A GUY THING.
IT MAKES YOU MORE...

00:40.000 --> 00:41.867
DURABLE.

00:41.867 --> 00:42.867
OH, REALLY?

00:42.867 --> 00:46.000
HOW MUCH DO YOU TAKE?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.033
ALL OF IT.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.233
THAT IS SO SWEET.

00:49.233 --> 00:51.734
BUT IT MUST HAVE
MADE THEM THINK

00:51.734 --> 00:53.834
YOU'RE A FEW YEARS
OLDER THAN YOU ARE.

00:53.834 --> 00:55.600
DEPENDS.

00:55.600 --> 00:56.900
DEPENDS ON WHAT?

00:56.900 --> 01:00.100
DEPENDS--46 DIAPERS,
29.95.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.600
ALAN!

01:01.600 --> 01:04.300
THERE'S A PICTURE OF A GUY
WATER-SKIING IN THEM!

01:04.300 --> 01:07.667
THIS COULDN'T BE
A FEAR-OF-AGING THING,
COULD IT?

01:07.667 --> 01:10.033
OH, NO, BECAUSE
I'M NOT AGING.

01:10.033 --> 01:11.367
NEITHER AM I.

01:11.367 --> 01:14.133
DUDES! WHERE ARE YOU
GUYS OFF TO?

01:14.133 --> 01:15.400
SHOOT SOME HOOPS.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.800
WANT SOME ACTUAL
COMPETITION?

01:16.800 --> 01:18.400
YEAH.
WHO DO YOU KNOW?

01:18.400 --> 01:21.200
YOU'D BE FUNNY
WITH A BASKETBALL
STUCK IN YOUR MOUTH?

01:21.200 --> 01:22.900
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT.

01:22.900 --> 01:26.000
WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND CALL THESE PEOPLE

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
AND GET ME OFF THIS
OLD FOGIES' MAILING LIST

01:29.000 --> 01:33.500
WHILE I PLAY A LITTLE
B'BALL WITH MY HOMIES?

01:36.200 --> 01:39.233
HONEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:39.233 --> 01:41.400
Nothing.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.233
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:44.233 --> 01:46.300
I can't move.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.500
AM I THE ONLY ONE
NOT MOVING?

01:51.500 --> 01:54.834
I'M CALLING THE DOCTOR.
I THINK YOU THREW
YOUR BACK OUT.

01:54.834 --> 01:59.100
Oh, no. I'm too young
to throw my back out.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.233
I got...

02:00.233 --> 02:03.967
play some b'ball
with my homies.

02:06.133 --> 02:08.834
Am I outside yet?

02:12.400 --> 02:14.800
THUS, THE TRANSCONTINENTAL
RAILROAD

02:14.800 --> 02:16.800
SPELLED THE END
OF THE PONY EXPRESS.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.233
MAIL SERVICE WAS FASTER,
MORE RELIABLE.

02:19.233 --> 02:21.300
LETTERS NO LONGER
HAD TO BE PASSED

02:21.300 --> 02:23.000
FROM HAND TO HAND.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.734
THESE JUST IN.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.867
MISS WILDER
WANTS TO KNOW

02:28.867 --> 02:33.100
WHAT MISS HARRINGTON
THINKS SHE SHOULD WEAR
TO HER PARTY.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.400
MISS HARRINGTON
WANTS TO KNOW

02:36.400 --> 02:39.934
WHAT MAKES MISS WILDER
THINK SHE'S EVEN INVITED.

02:39.934 --> 02:41.767
I'M NOT INVITED?

02:41.767 --> 02:43.233
WE'LL JUST SEE, O.K.?

02:43.233 --> 02:45.033
MR. MATTHEWS
WANTS TO KNOW

02:45.033 --> 02:49.200
IS THIS GOING TO BE A...
MAKE-UP PARTY.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.100
SURE, CORY.

02:53.100 --> 02:55.700
YOU CAN BORROW
MY LIP GLOSS.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.233
OUT! NOT UP.

02:57.233 --> 02:59.100
A MAKE<i>OUT </i>-PARTY.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.367
AH, SO IT IS.

03:02.033 --> 03:03.033
MR. MATTHEWS
WANTS TO KNOW

03:03.033 --> 03:05.734
IF THIS IS GOING
TO BE A MAKE-OUT PARTY.

03:05.734 --> 03:06.800
NOT FOR HIM.

03:09.767 --> 03:10.867
THERE'S NO WAY MELISSA'S

03:10.867 --> 03:13.367
GOING TO INVITE ME
TO HER PARTY NOW.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.967
SO FEENY CUTS YOU
OFF AT THE KNEES.

03:15.967 --> 03:18.800
PEOPLE FORGET.
YOU'LL GET INVITED
TO THE NEXT PARTY.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.200
YOU THINK?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.300
THIS IS HIGH SCHOOL.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.700
TOO MUCH GOING ON
TO REMEMBER ANYTHING.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.400
DON'T THINK I FORGOT
ABOUT YOU, BABOON.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.100
THINK I FORGOT LAST TUESDAY

03:28.100 --> 03:30.867
YOU SAT IN MY CHAIR
IN THE CAFETERIA?

03:30.867 --> 03:32.100
I-I'M SORRY, HARLEY.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.600
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
YOUR CHAIR.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.567
EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT'S HARLEY'S CHAIR.

03:36.567 --> 03:39.133
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
AND ALWAYS WILL BE,

03:39.133 --> 03:41.734
EVERY YEAR THAT
HE'S A SENIOR.

03:41.734 --> 03:43.400
AIN'T THAT RIGHT,
FRANKIE?

03:43.400 --> 03:45.734
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
I LIKE MY SISTER?

03:45.734 --> 03:50.734
NO! NO! I'M JUST SAYING
YOU HAVE A VERY...
CLOSE FAMILY.

03:50.734 --> 03:53.500
HEY,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

03:53.500 --> 03:55.200
I WANT TO CALL HOME.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.200
IS HE
GOING TO BE O.K.?

04:00.200 --> 04:01.834
HE'S GOT A FEW ISSUES.

04:01.834 --> 04:04.400
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
HAVE ONE ISSUE,

04:04.400 --> 04:07.233
AND THAT'S YOU, BABOON.
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

04:07.233 --> 04:10.000
I LOOK AT YOUR FACE,
AND I WANT TO HIT IT.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.800
IS THAT SO WRONG?

04:12.800 --> 04:15.000
THERE I AM, FINALS OF
THE CHESS TOURNAMENT,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.934
THREE MOVES AWAY
FROM CHECKMATE,

04:16.934 --> 04:19.667
AND OUT OF NOWHERE,
I SWALLOW MY ROOK.

04:19.667 --> 04:22.900
PARDON ME.
IT'S MY 11:00.

04:24.233 --> 04:27.567
I ALMOST WISH HE DID
KILL ME THIS TIME.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.100
HOW COME?

04:29.100 --> 04:33.000
I WOULDN'T BE HUMILIATED
WHEN I'M NOT INVITED
TO THE PARTY.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.100
YOU'RE SOUNDING
JUST A LITTLE WHINY.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.734
THIS IS
THE FIRST PARTY OF OUR
HIGH SCHOOL LIVES.

04:37.734 --> 04:40.300
IT'LL DIVIDE OUR CLASS
INTO TWO GROUPS--

04:40.300 --> 04:42.300
THOSE INVITED,
THE COOL GUYS,

04:42.300 --> 04:44.767
AND THOSE WHO WEREN'T,
THE GEEKS.

04:44.767 --> 04:46.000
YOU'RE LOSING IT, COR.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.734
I'M LOSING
MY WHOLE FUTURE!

04:47.734 --> 04:49.667
I MEAN, NOONE WILL TALK
TO ME EVER AGAIN.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.500
I MIGHT AS WELL GROW A HUMP,
FIND A TOWER,
AND RING THE BELL.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.600
DON'T WORRY, MAN.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.700
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
ON OUR COUCH FOR YOU.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.100
YOUR UNCLE FRANK
WAS ON THE COUCH.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.300
NO. NOT ANYMORE.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.300
HE WON THE LOTTERY
AND STOPPED TALKING
TO US.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.834
WHAT DID HE WIN?

05:03.834 --> 05:05.967
6 BUCKS.

05:05.967 --> 05:10.000
DON'T LOOK NOW,
BUT THE PONY EXPRESS
JUST PULLED INTO TOWN.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.300
OH, NO!
SHE'S HANDING OUT
THE INVITATIONS.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.100
SHAWN, THERE'S
BEEN A MIRACLE!

06:05.100 --> 06:08.133
YEAH. WE'RE GOING
TO BE LATE FOR CLASS.

06:08.133 --> 06:10.967
CLASS? WE DON'T NEED
NO STINKING CLASS!

06:10.967 --> 06:12.400
OUR FUTURES ARE SET!

06:12.400 --> 06:15.767
WE ARE HIGH SCHOOL GODS.

06:15.767 --> 06:17.200
COME. LET US REPAIR
TO THE GYM

06:17.200 --> 06:19.100
AND REJOICE
IN OUR INVITATION.

06:22.367 --> 06:23.367
IT'S GOING
TO BE KIND OF HARD,

06:23.367 --> 06:24.500
SINCE I DIDN'T GET ONE.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.400
WHAT?

06:26.400 --> 06:28.500
I DIDN'T GET INVITED.
NO BIGGIE.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.967
IT'S A MISTAKE.
YOU'RE THE COOLEST
GUY IN CLASS.

06:31.967 --> 06:33.300
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE INVITED.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.133
WELL,
LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.133
I'M GONNA FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

06:36.133 --> 06:39.000
LET IT GO, O.K.?
JUST LET IT GO.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.934
WANT ME TO ASK HER?
YEAH, WOULD YOU?

06:46.467 --> 06:47.467
HI.

06:47.467 --> 06:48.734
I'M CORY.

06:48.734 --> 06:49.734
SO?

06:49.734 --> 06:52.767
SO, YOU INVITED ME
TO YOUR PARTY.

06:52.767 --> 06:54.400
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

06:54.400 --> 06:56.000
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.100
NO, IT'S NOT A MISTAKE.
YOU'RE REALLY INVITED.

06:59.100 --> 07:02.500
NO. I MEANT ABOUT SHAWN.
YOU FORGOT HIS INVITATION.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.100
NO, I DIDN'T.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.600
HE'S NOT INVITED.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.300
O.K.?

07:10.200 --> 07:12.500
SO WHAT'S THE STORY?

07:12.500 --> 07:13.700
ALL RIGHT. LOOK.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.834
FROM WHAT I GATHER,
IN THE LAST THREE
SECONDS,

07:17.834 --> 07:20.133
EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD
HAS CHANGED.

07:20.133 --> 07:21.500
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:21.500 --> 07:22.667
I'M NOT SURE.

07:22.667 --> 07:26.900
I MEAN, SHAWN,
YOU'RE MUCH COOLER
THAN I AM.

07:26.900 --> 07:29.200
AT LEAST
I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.500
TRUST ME, I AM.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.467
THEN HOW COME
I GOT INVITED
AND YOU DIDN'T?

07:34.467 --> 07:37.100
SO I REALLY
DIDN'T GET INVITED.

07:37.100 --> 07:41.200
UNLESS IT'S A BIG
SURPRISE PARTY FOR YOU.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.867
I GUESS IT'S JUST ONE
OF THOSE HIGH SCHOOL
MYSTERIES,

07:44.867 --> 07:48.000
LIKE HOW JANITOR BUD
LOST HIS EYE.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.734
WELL, WHAT ARE
WE GOING TO DO?

07:50.734 --> 07:52.567
YOU'RE GOING
TO THE PARTY.

07:52.567 --> 07:55.000
I'M NOT GOING
IF YOU'RE NOT INVITED.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.100
DON'T SWEAT IT, CORY.
I'LL GO GRAB A BURGER.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.600
NO, YOU WON'T.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.934
AND WHY WON'T I?

08:00.934 --> 08:02.300
BECAUSE I'M COOL NOW,

08:02.300 --> 08:05.000
WHICH MEANS
I RUN WITH A VERY
INFLUENTIAL CROWD,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.300
WHICH MEANS I JUST
PICK UP THIS TELEPHONE,

08:07.300 --> 08:11.467
PULL A FEW STRINGS,
AND GET YOU INVITED
TO THE PARTY.

08:11.467 --> 08:12.900
WHO ARE YOU
GOING TO CALL?

08:12.900 --> 08:15.300
NORMALLY, I'D CALL YOU.

08:24.834 --> 08:26.100
IT TRIED TO EAT
MY MONEY, TOO.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.400
YOU GOT TO KICK IT.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.500
NO, NO, NO.
PUNISH IT. MAKE IT BEG.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.100
PRETTY GOOD,
FOR THE NEW TEACHER.

08:39.100 --> 08:42.033
HOW DO YOU THINK
I'M DOING SO FAR?

08:42.033 --> 08:43.667
YOU TEACH ENGLISH
PRETTY GOOD,

08:43.667 --> 08:47.200
AND THAT MAY COME IN
HANDY SOMEWHERE
DOWN THE LINE.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.467
<i>SI. ES MUY IMPORTANTE.</i>

08:49.467 --> 08:51.300
MORE IMPORTANT
IS WHAT TO DO

08:51.300 --> 08:53.734
WHEN YOU GET INVITED
TO A PARTY AND YOUR
FRIEND DOESN'T.

08:53.734 --> 08:54.867
HOW GOOD A FRIEND?

08:54.867 --> 08:56.100
YOUR BEST.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.100
HOW GOOD A PARTY?
THE BEST.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.233
WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF
YOU GO TO THE PARTY?

09:00.233 --> 09:01.233
HE SAYS HE WON'T MIND.

09:01.233 --> 09:02.400
BELIEVE HIM?
I WANT TO.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.100
'CAUSE YOU WANT TO GO.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.734
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'VE DECIDED.

09:05.734 --> 09:07.700
WHAT DO YOU
NEED ME FOR?

09:07.700 --> 09:10.500
YOU'RE NEW HERE,
SO YOU WOULDN'T
KNOW THIS,

09:10.500 --> 09:12.400
BUT I NEVER
REALLY, ACTUALLY

09:12.400 --> 09:15.033
THOUGHT OF MYSELF
AS COOL BEFORE.

09:15.033 --> 09:16.500
YOU NEVER DID?

09:16.500 --> 09:19.734
NO, SO NOW THAT PEOPLE
ARE SAYING I AM,

09:19.734 --> 09:21.300
IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

09:21.300 --> 09:22.934
WELL, YOU SHOULD
FEEL GOOD, MATTHEWS.

09:22.934 --> 09:26.400
JUST DON'T
GET CARRIED AWAY BY
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.000
OF COURSE NOT.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.567
WHY NOT?

09:29.567 --> 09:31.300
'CAUSE THAT
WOULDN'T BE COOL.

09:39.567 --> 09:43.133
VANDALIZING SCHOOL
PROPERTY, MR. MATTHEWS.

09:43.133 --> 09:45.000
THAT'LL BE
ONE DAY'S DETENTION.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.200
I'LL JUST KEEP THIS
AS EVIDENCE.

09:58.500 --> 10:04.500
"THE BUDDY EBSEN LOW,
LOW IMPACT WORKOUT VIDEO."

10:04.500 --> 10:05.934
[AMY]
HE'S IN HERE, GEORGE.

10:05.934 --> 10:07.967
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HIM YOURSELF?

10:07.967 --> 10:10.133
AH, ALAN,
I WAS WONDERING

10:10.133 --> 10:11.834
IF YOU'D CARE TO JOIN ME

10:11.834 --> 10:13.567
FOR A WORKOUT
AT THE HEALTH CLUB.

10:13.567 --> 10:15.467
WHAT FOR, GEORGE?

10:15.467 --> 10:18.567
FOR...HEALTH?

10:18.567 --> 10:19.600
TOO LATE.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.734
I TURNED 40.
MY BACK WENT OUT.

10:20.734 --> 10:23.600
ALL I CAN DO IS
LIE HERE AND WONDER

10:23.600 --> 10:26.800
HOW ANGELA LANSBURY
SOLVES ALL THOSE CRIMES.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.233
OH, GET UP, MAN.

10:28.233 --> 10:30.000
OOH! OOH! OOH! OOH!

10:30.000 --> 10:32.200
QUIET! YOU'RE A
DISGRACE TO ALL MEN.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.133
AMY, HE'S KILLING ME!

10:35.133 --> 10:37.367
COME ON.
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO WORK OUT.

10:37.367 --> 10:38.834
JUST COME DOWN
AND SIGN UP.

10:38.834 --> 10:42.200
I GET $50
FOR EACH REFERRAL.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.200
WELL, I'M ONLY
A SCHOOLTEACHER.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.767
YOU MAY BE IN DENIAL
ABOUT YOUR AGE,
BUT I'M NOT.

10:47.767 --> 10:48.900
I TURNED 40.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.834
MY BACK NEVER
WENT OUT BEFORE,

10:50.834 --> 10:51.834
AND THIS IS
A WARNING SIGN SAYING,

10:51.834 --> 10:53.834
IT MEANS
"SLOW DOWN,
LIE ON THE COUCH

10:53.834 --> 10:57.767
AND LISTEN TO THE HAIR
GROW IN YOUR EARS."

10:57.767 --> 10:59.200
SORRY.
DID ALL I COULD.

10:59.200 --> 11:03.934
THROW SOME DIRT ON HIM
AND BOOK A CRUISE.

11:03.934 --> 11:06.934
ALAN, THE DOCTOR SAYS
THAT THE ONLY REASON
YOU CAN'T MOVE

11:06.934 --> 11:08.467
IS BECAUSE
YOU WON'T TRY.

11:08.467 --> 11:11.100
NOW, I HAVE
ALL THE SYMPATHY
IN THE WORLD FOR YOU,

11:11.100 --> 11:13.133
BUT IF YOU DON'T GET UP,

11:13.133 --> 11:15.934
I'M LEAVING YOU
FOR THE FIRST THING
THAT MOVES.

11:15.934 --> 11:18.100
BEFORE YOU GO,

11:18.100 --> 11:19.867
COULD YOU HAND ME
THAT REMOTE?

11:19.867 --> 11:21.000
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S IT.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.233
NO, PLEASE.

11:22.233 --> 11:23.834
OOH! OOH!

11:23.834 --> 11:25.767

11:29.834 --> 11:30.967

11:30.967 --> 11:32.867
IT'S NOT EVEN DARK YET.

11:32.867 --> 11:34.400
UPSTAIRS.
DO HOMEWORK.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.300
SORRY. IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT,

11:37.300 --> 11:39.400
AND THERE'S A PARTY
OUT THERE THAT'S JUST
CALLING MY NAME.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.700
BOY-GIRL, DON'T YOU KNOW?

11:41.700 --> 11:45.500
OH, WELL, EXCUSE ME,
WILT CHAMBERLAIN,

11:45.500 --> 11:47.500
BUT WHAT PARTY IS THIS
THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

11:47.500 --> 11:49.100
MOTHER, FATHER...

11:49.100 --> 11:51.600
THERE'S A SOCIAL EVENT TONIGHT
AT MELISSA HARRINGTON'S.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.100
MIGHT I ATTEND?

11:53.100 --> 11:54.100
WELL...

11:54.100 --> 11:55.300
LET HIM GO, AMY.

11:55.300 --> 11:58.233
CORY, I'LL PICK YOU UP
IN FIVE HOURS.

11:58.233 --> 11:59.400
YOU WILL?

11:59.400 --> 12:01.900

I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW.

[GARGLING]

12:09.100 --> 12:10.900
AAH!

12:10.900 --> 12:12.600
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?
YOU SWALLOWED THAT?

12:12.600 --> 12:14.100
I'M TAKING
NO CHANCES TONIGHT.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.867
I WANT IT IN MY STOMACH
ON RESERVE.

12:16.867 --> 12:17.867
WHY?

12:17.867 --> 12:20.100
I'M GOING TO
A MAKE-OUT PARTY.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.800
IF I BURP, MINTY FRESH.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.734
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
IT MAKES SENSE.

12:24.734 --> 12:26.233
HEY,
WHERE'S MY DEODORANT?

12:26.233 --> 12:28.567
IN MY PANTS.
YOU'RE SICK!

12:28.567 --> 12:29.567
I'M COOL.

12:29.567 --> 12:30.700
SINCE WHEN?

12:30.700 --> 12:33.000
SINCE MELISSA HARRINGTON
INVITED ME TO HER PARTY.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.400
WHO'S
MELISSA HARRINGTON?

12:34.400 --> 12:36.600
ONLY THE COOLEST GIRL
IN SEVENTH GRADE.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.400
AND YOU GOT INVITED?
I DID.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.600
SO THAT MAKES YOU
COOL NOW, RIGHT?

12:40.600 --> 12:41.667
I BELIEVE IT DOES.

12:41.667 --> 12:42.934
WELL, HOW ABOUT THAT?

12:42.934 --> 12:45.967
YOU THINK SOMEBODY'S
GOING TO STAY

12:45.967 --> 12:47.967
A CURLY-HAIRED RUNT
THE REST
OF THEIR LIVES.

12:47.967 --> 12:50.667
THEN ONE DAY
THEY'RE COOL.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.800
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

12:52.800 --> 12:53.800
WHEW!

12:53.800 --> 12:55.233
WHOA!

12:55.233 --> 12:58.100
I MEAN,
YOU DIDN'T SAY YOU
WERE THIS COOL, COR.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.967
O.K. KNOCK IT OFF,
ERIC.

12:59.967 --> 13:01.033
I'M GOING TO HAVE MOM

13:01.033 --> 13:03.900
CUT ALL THE FEET
OFF YOUR PAJAMAS.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.967
YOU JUST MAY BE READY,

13:05.967 --> 13:07.734
MR. JULIO IGLESIAS.

13:07.734 --> 13:09.100
HUH?

13:09.100 --> 13:10.867
WELL, IF I'M SO COOL,

13:10.867 --> 13:13.300
I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T
MINE ME USING

13:13.300 --> 13:15.400
SOME OF YOUR
VERY COOL COLOGNE.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.300
STAY AWAY FROM MY
RAMPAGING STALLION.

13:18.300 --> 13:19.934
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

[SNIFFING]

13:23.033 --> 13:24.300

I'M ROTTING.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.400
RELAX, DAD.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.400
IT'S JUST
MY RAMPAGING STALLION.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:31.500 --> 13:34.467
I THINK IF THE PARTY
DOESN'T HAVE
ADEQUATE VENTILATION,

13:34.467 --> 13:36.967
YOU'RE ALL GOING TO DIE.

13:36.967 --> 13:38.000
MOM?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.033
I THINK YOU SMELL
VERY RAMPAGING.

13:41.033 --> 13:43.567
NOW, BE SURE TO THANK
MELISSA'S PARENTS

13:43.567 --> 13:45.400
WHEN YOU
LEAVE THE PARTY.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.133
CALL SHAWN. TELL HIM
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

13:47.133 --> 13:49.233
UH, SHAWN'S NOT GOING.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.000
IS HE SICK?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.400
NO. HE JUST
WASN'T INVITED.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.800
WELL, WHY NOT?

13:54.800 --> 13:57.033
I GUESS HE WASN'T
COOL ENOUGH.

13:57.033 --> 13:58.467
BUT YOU ARE?

13:58.467 --> 14:00.300
I DON'T MAKE
THESE DECISIONS

14:00.300 --> 14:02.033
ABOUT WHO'S COOL
AND WHO'S NOT.

14:02.033 --> 14:04.767
I JUST GOT INVITED,
AND I WANT TO GO.

14:04.767 --> 14:07.000
IN FACT,
SHAWN SAID TO GO.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.567
I HOPE YOU KNOW

14:08.567 --> 14:11.500
THAT IT'S COOL
NOT TO FORGET
WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.233
JUST BECAUSE
I'M GROWING UP

14:13.233 --> 14:14.734
DOESN'T MEAN
I'M CHANGING, ALAN.

ARE COMING LATER.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.900
THERE'S A BUG
IN THE ONION DIP.

HELP NOTICING

THERE'S NOT EXACTLY
A CROSS-SECTION
OF THE STUDENT BODY.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.100
MY PARENTS CHECKED
THE GUEST LIST

15:41.100 --> 15:43.834
AND TOOK OFF
ALL THE COOL GUYS.

15:43.834 --> 15:45.500
THAT'S WHY YOU
DIDN'T INVITE SHAWN.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.100
SHAWN WAS THE FIRST
PERSON OFF THE LIST.

GOING TO HAPPEN.

NONE OF
THE GIRLS SHOW UP.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.767
SINCE NONE OF THE GIRLS
SHOW UP,

16:14.767 --> 16:16.000
NONE OF
THE REGULAR GUYS COME.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.500
CORY, WHAT ARE YOU

20:21.500 --> 20:24.100
I'M THE WORST
KIND OF GEEK.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.400
I'M A GEEK WHO DIDN'T
KNOW HE WAS A GEEK.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.400

TO LOOSEN UP.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.967

20:48.400 --> 20:50.100
WHAT ELSE DO YOU
NEED TO KNOW?

20:50.100 --> 20:54.200
I NEED TO KNOW
HOW TO BE COOL,
LIKE YOU.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.500
I'M NOT COOL.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.000
YES, YOU ARE!

20:58.000 --> 20:59.367
SHAWN,
LOOK AROUND YOU.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.900
OH, YOU'RE TEACHING ME
HOW TO BE COOL.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.000
HUH?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.033
YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOW ME

21:19.033 --> 21:20.767
THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE YOU GO,

21:20.767 --> 21:24.600
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE COOL
WHEREVER YOU GO IS THE COOL
PLACE TO BE, RIGHT?

21:24.600 --> 21:25.700
CORY?

21:25.700 --> 21:27.867

THING TO SAY.

21:40.934 --> 21:42.300
OH, ALAN,

21:42.300 --> 21:46.000
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,
ANOTHER CATALOG ORDER

THEN WHAT?

21:49.800 --> 21:51.600
JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING

21:51.600 --> 21:53.600
I BOUGHT FOR MY
<i>NEXT </i>HUSBAND.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.300
OH, YEAH? WHERE IS IT?

21:55.300 --> 21:57.800
RIGHT HERE.

22:01.300 --> 22:02.600
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

22:02.600 --> 22:07.667
I THINK I'M REGAINING
SOME SENSATION IN MY LEGS.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.700
ENOUGH SO YOU CAN
GET UPSTAIRS?

22:09.700 --> 22:12.934
OH, I DON'T KNOW, AMY.
I DON'T KNOW.

22:12.934 --> 22:15.033
BECAUSE HERE'S
WHAT'S WAITING FOR YOU.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.133
OOH!

22:28.934 --> 22:30.100
YES, I'M HAPPY, TOO.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.500
BEFORE YOU MOVE ON
TO YOUR SECOND HUSBAND,

22:32.500 --> 22:35.367
I'D LIKE TO GIVE
THAT OUTFIT A ONCE-OVER,

22:35.367 --> 22:36.667
MAYBE A TWICE-OVER.

22:36.667 --> 22:38.834
YOU'RE NOT
THAT YOUNG ANYMORE.

22:38.834 --> 22:41.900
OH, YEAH?

22:41.900 --> 22:43.567
