WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:04.472
Previously on Salvation...
Russia has shut off

00:04.505 --> 00:06.307
all communication
with the U.S. government.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.775
Why?
We don't know.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.211
Secretary Calhoun,
I know the Russian ambassador.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.280
Katya Osinov, she's a friend,
I can reach out to her.

00:12.313 --> 00:14.715
Whatever we stole from you
is retribution.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.550
Retribution for what?

00:16.584 --> 00:18.586
Something called Atlas.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.587
What exactly did she say,

00:19.620 --> 00:20.788
Ms. Barrows?

00:20.821 --> 00:22.090
Grace?

00:22.123 --> 00:23.224
She didn't know,

00:23.257 --> 00:24.458
or couldn't say.

00:24.492 --> 00:27.795
An asteroid is coming
in 148 days?

00:27.828 --> 00:30.231
Liam, how could you
keep this from me?

00:30.264 --> 00:31.399
I got to go.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.234
Where?
Home.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.268
Jillian...

00:34.302 --> 00:36.104
nobody outside the Pentagon
knows about this,

00:36.137 --> 00:37.638
and if word got out...
Screw you.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.440
Who is this?

00:39.473 --> 00:41.175
(distorted voice): A friend...
with the same agenda.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.111
Atlas. Check the message.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.079
All roads lead to Tanz.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.248
Who are you? RE/SYST?

00:47.281 --> 00:49.317
The global hacker collective?

00:49.350 --> 00:50.851
If we can get the crystal
from Nicholas,

00:50.884 --> 00:53.221
we can rebuild our own
EmDrive.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.189
HARRIS: I don't want to be
without you anymore.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.624
KATYA:
We only hope the Americans

00:56.657 --> 00:57.658
do not make any more moves

00:57.691 --> 01:00.794
signaling aggression
toward the Russian people.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.730
They're saying Russia's
pointing missiles at us,

01:02.763 --> 01:05.099
preparing for war.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.136
(indistinct chatter)

01:10.338 --> 01:12.140
(reporters clamoring)

01:15.876 --> 01:17.411
(chatter subsides)

01:18.546 --> 01:20.581
Morning.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.550
As you're aware, Russia violated

01:22.583 --> 01:25.653
the Intermediate Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty earlier today

01:25.686 --> 01:27.388
when it ground-tested
banned missiles.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.722
In addition,
the Russian government

01:28.756 --> 01:30.491
has opened its missile silos,

01:30.524 --> 01:33.561
indicating its intentions
to engage in military conflict.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.397
These actions are a threat
to international security.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.232
The president and
Secretary of Defense

01:38.266 --> 01:40.901
have been in closed door
discussions with NATO

01:40.934 --> 01:41.702
and are crafting
an appropriate response.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.771
(reporters clamoring)
Yes, Russ?

01:43.804 --> 01:46.207
RUSS: Grace, can you give us
any insight into the reasons

01:46.240 --> 01:47.675
behind Russia's sudden
aggressive stance?

01:47.708 --> 01:49.643
The Russian government
hasn't given any as of yet.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.312
But our conscience is clear.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.814
These acts of aggression
are unprovoked.

01:53.847 --> 01:54.748
First, they pulled
their ambassador,

01:54.782 --> 01:57.318
then they violate
the anti-missile treaty.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.919
The DoD has to know something.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.554
I just told you
what we know, Ms. Neel.

02:00.588 --> 02:01.689
Maybe you should listen better.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.591
(reporters clamoring)

02:03.624 --> 02:05.193
WOMAN: Is the president
going to give a statement

02:05.226 --> 02:06.126
to the American people?

02:06.160 --> 02:08.296
When the president
has something to say,

02:08.329 --> 02:09.563
she'll say it.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.131
What alternatives
are being considered, Grace?

02:12.766 --> 02:14.902
All options are on the table.

02:14.935 --> 02:18.906
(reporters clamoring)

02:18.939 --> 02:21.509
HARRIS:
We returned from London

02:21.542 --> 02:24.212
at 0700 hours this morning
in possession of a rare crystal

02:24.245 --> 02:26.747
needed to reconstruct
a new full-scale EmDrive.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.782
CALHOUN: Which will propel
a gravity tractor

02:28.816 --> 02:30.451
to the asteroid
in time to divert it?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.486
It's a bold move, Harris.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.854
And done without my advice

02:33.887 --> 02:35.756
or my authorization.
Sometimes,

02:35.789 --> 02:39.927
it's better to ask for
forgiveness than permission.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.462
You taught me that, sir.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.232
It's only better
if you get results.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.299
And we did.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.202
We narrowly beat the Russians
to that meteorite.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.438
But they can still
build an EmDrive

02:50.471 --> 02:51.972
with the prototype they stole

02:52.005 --> 02:53.907
from Tanz Industries
and then use it

02:53.941 --> 02:56.510
to launch their own
gravity tractor, correct?
Yes,

02:56.544 --> 02:59.280
but there's no telling whether
they'll be successful.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.582
Or whether they have
the same goals as we do.

03:01.615 --> 03:02.983
CALHOUN: Whoever launches
this thing first

03:03.016 --> 03:05.219
has control of the outcome.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.987
Where are we with Mr. Tanz?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.789
He's within
days of having

03:08.822 --> 03:10.624
a fully functioning EmDrive.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.327
Good. This is a race
we need to win.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.296
Claire, let POTUS know we're
moving forward with the launch

03:15.329 --> 03:17.365
as soon as
Tanz is ready.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.233
But the Russians
have issued a warning:

03:19.267 --> 03:20.634
if we launch anything,
they'll shoot it down.

03:20.668 --> 03:21.835
With everything
that's happening,

03:21.869 --> 03:23.804
sir, it's a credible threat.

03:23.837 --> 03:24.972
And so are we.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.674
Let's just
hope no one

03:26.707 --> 03:28.909
makes a move they regret.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.768
(door opens)

03:54.802 --> 03:56.504
Well.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.838
(door closes)

03:57.871 --> 03:59.540
That was grueling.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.575
My tap shoes need new soles.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.411
I'm sorry.
(chuckles)

04:05.045 --> 04:08.282
Oh. I wish
we could just run away,

04:08.316 --> 04:10.884
spend our last days
on an island somewhere,

04:10.918 --> 04:12.686
pretend none of this
was happening.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.356
Yeah.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.957
I know.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.058
Mm.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.760
But that's not who you are.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.631
You're a fighter, Grace.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.466
And we're in this together.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.034
No matter what.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.874
First, the Russians
steal our EmDrive.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.709
Now they're threatening
military action.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.311
Why would they stand in our way?

04:37.345 --> 04:39.046
We don't know,
and it's useless to speculate.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.881
But rest assured,
we are going to do

04:40.914 --> 04:42.583
whatever it takes to launch it.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.784
"Whatever it takes"?

04:43.817 --> 04:45.453
Is that supposed
to be comforting?

04:45.486 --> 04:46.920
Harris, they've got missiles

04:46.954 --> 04:48.322
poised at the ready,
and our governments

04:48.356 --> 04:49.990
are not talking to each other.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.593
You must know something
about what's happening here.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.961
I know what you know.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.730
GRACE:
Retribution for what?

04:56.764 --> 04:58.399
Something called Atlas.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.838
Is it possible
this has something to do

05:04.872 --> 05:06.874
with Project Atlas?
I know you said

05:06.907 --> 05:09.843
never to mention it...
Atlas is a dead program, Grace.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.845
The files were closed
years ago.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.681
What would make you think that?

05:13.714 --> 05:15.082
(knocking on door)

05:16.417 --> 05:17.818
Come in.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.355
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs,

05:21.389 --> 05:22.423
line one, sir.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.692
Thank you.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.927
Grace.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.797
You do your job, let us do ours.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.766
Just tell Darius
to keep plugging away.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.334
(quietly):
Okay.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.578
(door closes)

06:06.099 --> 06:08.101
Do I need to take
your phone away?

06:08.135 --> 06:10.471
Geez. You're like Big Brother,
you're always watching.

06:10.504 --> 06:13.541
Big Brother's also waiting
very impatiently.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.176
Where are we on the LIDAR?
Uh...

06:16.209 --> 06:18.712
Laser system is measuring
distance to one millimeter.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.014
It is ready to be installed
to the gravity tractor.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.416
The EmDrive...?

06:22.450 --> 06:24.184
Cone's being dusted.

06:24.217 --> 06:28.188
Let me see the
guidance systems chip.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.957
Almost.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.460
See if you can increase
the throughput

06:32.493 --> 06:33.794
by another ten percent.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.429
I'm not sure what the rush is.

06:35.463 --> 06:36.497
We can't even
launch the thing.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.466
The Russians are just gonna
shoot it out of the sky.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.033
The EmDrive
will take weeks

06:40.067 --> 06:42.069
to propel the gravity tractor
up to that asteroid.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.572
We need to work fast
and hope that the government

06:44.605 --> 06:48.075
ends this geopolitical
quagmire in time.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.877
Since when do you have faith
in the government?

06:49.910 --> 06:51.612
I don't. But, you know,

06:51.645 --> 06:52.913
on the off chance
that I'm wrong...

06:52.946 --> 06:54.582
just get back to it.

06:54.615 --> 06:57.918
Okay. Thanks for the pep talk.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.588
In your next life,
don't coach Little League.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.623
(sighs)

07:07.995 --> 07:09.497
Liam.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.665
You have a visitor.
Who?

07:11.699 --> 07:13.734
Amanda Neel, that reporter
from Capitol Eyes.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.669
Should I show her
the door?
Yeah.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.137
Yeah, the door to hell,
where she belongs.

07:18.606 --> 07:19.740
Wait.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.142
I'll show her the door myself.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.581
(doorbells jingle)

07:27.615 --> 07:29.116
Good morning. Welcome...

07:29.149 --> 07:30.784
Jillian.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.520
JILLIAN:
Hi, Dad.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.987
Excuse me one second,
would you, please?

07:34.021 --> 07:35.489
What're you doing here?

07:35.523 --> 07:37.024
I mean, you know,
I'm glad to see you.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.659
I have a couple
days off work,

07:38.692 --> 07:39.693
and I wanted to come home.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.762
Oh, I'm so glad you did.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.864
Mwah.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.799
Why did they...
Oh, yeah.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.100
You see what's going
on with the news?

07:47.134 --> 07:49.269
It's crazy stuff, huh?

07:49.302 --> 07:50.871
Yeah. It's crazy.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.006
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.141
What?

07:54.174 --> 07:56.176
What is it? You okay?

07:56.209 --> 07:58.946
Hey, hey. What's go...
what's going on?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.081
(sighs)

08:01.114 --> 08:03.584
Dad, there's, um...

08:03.617 --> 08:05.519
something important
I need to tell you.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.588
LAURA: Hey, I just found
a first edition

08:07.621 --> 08:09.823
Hemingway from a book dealer
in Newton.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.158
Jillian.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.926
Laura.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.632
JILLIAN: What are
you doing here?

08:18.666 --> 08:21.168
I'm-I'm working here now.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.637
I thought your dad
told you.

08:23.671 --> 08:26.106
Yeah. I, uh...
(chuckles)

08:26.139 --> 08:27.908
I got some news for
you, as well, Jills.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.242
I don't know,
I should probably just...

08:29.276 --> 08:31.545
just come right
out with it, right?

08:31.579 --> 08:33.847
Uh... (sighs)

08:35.616 --> 08:37.184
Laura and I are engaged.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.159
I just wanted to apologize.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.729
Jillian told me that she
was going home to Boston.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.699
And I never meant to cause
a rift in your relationship.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.066
A rift?

08:54.635 --> 08:55.769
Try black hole.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.204
What exactly did you tell her?

08:57.237 --> 08:58.739
The truth.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.741
That I was worried about you.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.710
Hard as that is to believe.
Oh, no, not at all.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.144
You seem like a very caring

09:04.177 --> 09:05.813
snake in the grass.
Look, I...

09:05.846 --> 09:07.314
I've been chasing a story.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.817
Ever since I saw you,
Darius and Grace Barrows

09:09.850 --> 09:11.652
at the Embassy Ball.
Really?

09:11.685 --> 09:14.021
I thought you were
just flirting with me.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.256
Okay, I know that I wasn't
honest with you that night.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.025
I'm sorry.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.927
But since then,
people have died.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.698
And I-I think it has something
to do with this.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.900
I got this photo from
a reputable source.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.137
Supposedly,

09:30.170 --> 09:33.607
it's tied to a secret
government program.

09:33.641 --> 09:34.975
Project Atlas.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.109
What is it?

09:36.143 --> 09:38.779
Maybe you should ask your boss.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.380
That's Tanz technology.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.283
Which means you're in the
middle of something big.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.885
Dead center.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.119
With everything
that's happening now,

09:46.153 --> 09:47.254
with Russia,

09:47.287 --> 09:48.922
I think it's
all connected.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.057
What makes you say that?

09:51.224 --> 09:53.226
This.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.364
LIAM:
It's in Russian.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.837
The Russian Government hasn't
given any as of yet.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.973
But our conscience is clear.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.408
These acts of aggression
are unprovoked.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.844
Well, if it isn't
the stable girl.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.980
Nobody shovels manure

10:13.013 --> 10:14.147
quite like Grace Barrows.
Can you turn that off?

10:14.181 --> 10:15.783
I can't get enough.

10:15.816 --> 10:16.917
GRACE: Will you please
turn that off?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.151
It's binge TV.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.854
How will we destroy
the world today?

10:20.888 --> 10:23.256
I can't wait to find out.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.058
You want me to brief you on
the latest or would you like

10:25.092 --> 10:26.960
to mock me for
a few more minutes?

10:26.994 --> 10:28.762
H-How did we
end up here, Grace?

10:28.796 --> 10:30.097
We've got a working
EmDrive,

10:30.130 --> 10:31.431
a gravity tractor

10:31.464 --> 10:34.101
ready to launch, and
our incompetent leaders

10:34.134 --> 10:36.336
can't get it off the ground
without starting World War III.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.171
Explain, please.
I wish I could.

10:38.205 --> 10:41.108
I can't get a straight
answer from anyone.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.176
So all that gush from
Harris at the hangar

10:43.210 --> 10:46.013
the other day about how
he wants to be with you forever,

10:46.046 --> 10:47.748
he didn't tell you forever
might mean a day and a half

10:47.781 --> 10:48.682
the way these goons run things?

10:48.716 --> 10:50.117
Darius, you're really
pushing my limit.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.786
We've done the impossible.
We've hand-delivered

10:52.820 --> 10:54.187
a solution to the
world's greatest problem,

10:54.221 --> 10:56.189
but they've completely
mucked it up.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.291
How are we supposed to
come up with a game plan

10:58.325 --> 11:00.293
when we don't even know
what's on the board?
Hey.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.862
I think I may be

11:01.895 --> 11:02.863
able to help.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.868
TANZ:
Looks like a piece of my tech

11:07.901 --> 11:10.037
fused to some
sort of rock.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.239
Where in Russia was this taken?
LIAM: I don't know.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.941
The metadata was erased,
but there's some lettering here

11:13.974 --> 11:15.275
on this backpack.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.778
GRACE:
"We learn not for the school

11:17.811 --> 11:18.812
but for life."

11:21.815 --> 11:23.283
Russian Studies minor.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.985
LIAM:
Well, Amanda, that reporter,

11:25.018 --> 11:27.387
she says it has something
to do with Project Atlas.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.424
Atlas? She brought that
up to me a few weeks ago.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.760
Do you know what it is?
No.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.294
I just know
it gets people killed

11:34.327 --> 11:36.196
when they poke their noses
where they don't belong.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.365
Harris said it was
a dead program, but...
But what?

11:40.768 --> 11:42.770
My friend Katya,
the Russian ambassador,

11:42.803 --> 11:45.906
she said her country stole
our EmDrive out of retribution

11:45.939 --> 11:48.041
for Atlas.
We need to talk to her.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.076
We can't.
She was called back to Moscow

11:49.109 --> 11:49.676
when they shuttered the embassy.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.746
Liam, contact Amanda Neel.

11:52.780 --> 11:53.981
You need to dig deeper.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.749
Find out where she
got that photo.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.851
Meantime, I'm gonna find out
what my technology has to do

11:57.885 --> 11:58.886
with all this.
How?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.120
By going to the source.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.455
Grab your passport

12:02.489 --> 12:03.824
and a pair of
comfortable shoes.

12:03.857 --> 12:04.758
We're going to Russia.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.795
(chuckles) What?

12:07.828 --> 12:09.329
Why? They won't
talk to us.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.964
No.

12:10.998 --> 12:11.999
They won't talk to
the government.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.733
Maybe they'll talk to me.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.005
Grace, the world's
about to catch fire,

12:18.038 --> 12:19.873
and we may be the only
ones who can stop it.

12:19.907 --> 12:20.908
Are you coming
or aren't you?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.219
*

12:45.999 --> 12:46.666
ZOE:
What kind of meeting?

12:46.699 --> 12:49.302
Uh, business
with Darius Tanz.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.571
But I can't...
You can't talk about it.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.806
You know,
I really don't know

12:52.840 --> 12:54.574
why we talk at all.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.944
Zoe, look,
I can't tell you

12:56.977 --> 12:58.411
what I'm working on right now,
but there is something

12:58.445 --> 12:59.412
I can tell you.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.481
(sighs)

13:01.514 --> 13:02.549
I'm seeing someone.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.985
Darius Tanz?

13:05.018 --> 13:05.819
(chuckles):
No, no, no.

13:05.853 --> 13:06.854
Oh.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.321
Harris Edwards.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.223
Your boss?

13:10.257 --> 13:12.325
(car honks outside)
Wow. Is that even allowed?

13:12.359 --> 13:14.494
No. Which is why
I've had to be discreet.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.030
Are you serious about him?

13:17.064 --> 13:18.231
I'm planning on transferring
out of the Pentagon

13:18.265 --> 13:19.199
so we can be together.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.934
(scoffs)

13:20.968 --> 13:24.171
He's got a son your age, Dylan.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.039
We've been wanting to
tell you both for so long,

13:26.073 --> 13:27.540
but it was complicated.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.142
When I'm back,
I want you to meet him.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.011
Me, too.
(chuckles)

13:31.044 --> 13:32.212
Thank you for telling me.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.147
Of course.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.349
(car honks outside)

13:36.383 --> 13:38.285
Good luck.
I love you.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.552
(exhales)

13:48.095 --> 13:50.230
Yes, Millie.
A family emergency.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.932
I hope to be
back tomorrow.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.301
Thank you.
The jet will get us
there in a few hours.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.937
Private plane, no names
on the manifest. Phone.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.240
Can't take any chances
we're being tracked.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.576
What'd you tell Harris?

14:06.279 --> 14:08.015
Nothing.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.351
Plausible deniability.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.520
He's already put his
ass on the line, he...

14:13.553 --> 14:15.455
can't do it again
without repercussions.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.896
Must be hard, all these
secrets between you.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.966
We all have our roles to play.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.467
This is the part I've chosen.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.280
How long will it take the
USS Pike and her battle group

14:40.313 --> 14:42.549
to reach the Baltic?
Approximately 48 hours.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.251
All right, well,
get them moving.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.652
We'll shoot down
anything they launch.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.554
What about retaliation?

14:47.587 --> 14:50.958
We can hit Moscow faster
than they can hit us.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.225
Our NATO allies have
given us that edge,

14:52.259 --> 14:54.127
and Russia knows that.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.996
We'll have to get all our teams
in position

14:56.029 --> 14:57.230
and hope the Russians
aren't stupid enough

14:57.264 --> 14:58.631
to destroy themselves.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.367
And the rest of us
along with them.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.468
I need a moment of your time.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.502
Both of you.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.706
Before the Russians pulled out,

15:06.739 --> 15:08.976
the agency was monitoring
all communications

15:09.009 --> 15:10.944
with their ambassador,
Katya Osinov,

15:10.978 --> 15:13.246
including her meeting
with Grace Barrows.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.381
Tell me something I don't know.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.382
Okay.

15:16.383 --> 15:20.553
KATYA: Whatever we stole
from you is retribution.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.156
GRACE:
Retribution for what?

15:23.190 --> 15:25.725
KATYA:
Something called Atlas.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.726
(taps keyboard)

15:26.759 --> 15:28.328
CLAIRE:
Grace Barrows

15:28.361 --> 15:29.997
got this information
from the Russian ambassador

15:30.030 --> 15:31.298
and kept it from us.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.732
They know about Atlas.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.567
Which explains everything.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.038
Get me Grace
Barrows... now.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.311
Mom hasn't even been
gone two years.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.578
I know.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.713
It's a lot to process.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.615
"Process"?

15:48.648 --> 15:49.749
Laura was Mom's best friend.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.052
She moved in on you
like the shark from Jaws.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.320
That is not true.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.654
And that is not fair.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.556
(sighs)

16:05.365 --> 16:08.735
My soul mate died...

16:08.768 --> 16:13.006
and I-I figured my heart
would die with her.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.108
Laura was there.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.709
At first as
just a friend, but...

16:20.147 --> 16:22.215
It just happened.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.652
Do what you want, Dad.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.020
Jillian.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.655
Jillian.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.790
Wait.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.126
What is going on with you?

16:33.160 --> 16:34.327
You don't seem yourself.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.462
Did something happen?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.297
At work or with Liam?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.499
LIAM:
Jillian.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.101
Nobody outside the
Pentagon knows about this,

16:41.134 --> 16:42.035
and if word got out...

16:42.069 --> 16:43.170
Oh, screw you.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.109
I got to get some air.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.746
What kind of
family emergency?

16:53.780 --> 16:56.083
She didn't say.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.684
She cleared her schedule,
left the Pentagon

16:57.717 --> 16:59.452
and turned off her phone.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.454
Go ahead.
Try calling her.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.162
(line ringing)

17:09.196 --> 17:10.397
GRACE:
You've reached Grace Barrows.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.664
Please leave a message.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.765
(phone beeps)

17:12.799 --> 17:14.567
(sighs)

17:14.601 --> 17:16.769
Millie, the second you hear
from Ms. Barrows,

17:16.803 --> 17:19.439
I want you to patch her
into my phone immediately.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.040
Where are you going?
To find Grace.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.415
Harris. A reminder.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.617
You can't let personal
feelings get in the way

17:30.650 --> 17:32.619
of your judgment here.
Thank you, Claire,

17:32.652 --> 17:34.554
but I don't need to be
schooled in my job duties.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.356
I'd hardly call
you objective

17:36.389 --> 17:38.091
when it comes to Grace.

17:38.125 --> 17:42.429
And, Harris, if she doesn't have
an outstanding reason why she

17:42.462 --> 17:44.597
left this key piece of
information out of her debrief,

17:44.631 --> 17:47.200
not even you will be
able to protect her.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.279
For a country that outlawed
religion not so long ago,

17:59.312 --> 18:01.348
there's a hell of a lot
of churches around here.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.849
You're sure this
is the right one?

18:02.882 --> 18:05.718
Yeah. When I visited last
year, she took me here.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.540
Grace.

18:27.574 --> 18:28.841
What are you doing here?

18:28.875 --> 18:31.211
Darius Tanz.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.145
I know who you are.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.814
We need to talk.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.649
I'm with my family.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.451
Katya, things are urgent.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.420
Please.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.733
Hey.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.836
So, you wanted Darius's
attention, and you got it.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.905
I need to know a few more
details about the photo.

19:00.707 --> 19:04.244
And what do I get in exchange?

19:04.277 --> 19:07.180
What do you want?

19:10.817 --> 19:14.321
GRACE: Katya, your government's
cut off all communications

19:14.354 --> 19:15.722
with the United States.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.790
We're on the brink of war,
and we don't know why.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.859
You mentioned something
about Atlas being the cause?

19:19.892 --> 19:21.628
Yes.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.562
You must know something
more about it.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.931
Why don't you ask
Mr. Tanz?

19:24.964 --> 19:26.333
He spearheaded it.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.835
Oh, I'm-I'm afraid
I-I don't understand.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.373
Does this photo have
any meaning to you?

19:33.406 --> 19:34.441
It was taken
here in Russia.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.546
Just more proof.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.248
Proof? Of what?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.250
That the U.S. was working
with you, Mr. Tanz,

19:43.283 --> 19:45.785
to create some sort of
super weapon to destroy us.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.455
Atlas is a weapons program?

19:49.889 --> 19:52.225
That's all I know.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.726
That and Mr. Tanz's company
provided the weapon.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.462
I can assure you,
Ms. Osinov,

19:55.495 --> 19:57.864
whatever Atlas is or was,
I had no part in it.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.233
I started my company
with one goal:

20:00.267 --> 20:02.869
to create a better world,
not destroy it.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.471
This is a misunderstanding.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.405
If Darius and
I could get

20:05.438 --> 20:06.673
a meeting with the
minister of defense...

20:06.706 --> 20:07.874
Grace.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.310
I've said too much.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.379
I have my family
to think about.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.480
Katya, wait.

20:13.513 --> 20:14.747
If we don't end this conflict,

20:14.781 --> 20:16.649
the entire human race
will become extinct.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.252
They say that about every war.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.288
I'm not talking about a war.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.389
I'm talking about
something much worse.

20:24.791 --> 20:25.758
What could be worse?

20:29.762 --> 20:32.365
There's something
I need to tell you.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.802
(knock on door)

20:43.943 --> 20:45.011
Hey.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.479
Zoe?

20:46.513 --> 20:48.615
Yes?

20:48.648 --> 20:51.451
I'm Deputy Secretary of Defense
Harris Edwards.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.886
I need to speak
to your mother now.

21:04.331 --> 21:07.734
How soon?
146 days.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.669
I have the technology
to stop it,

21:09.702 --> 21:10.903
but we have to be
able to launch it

21:10.937 --> 21:12.071
without getting
blown out of the sky.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.406
We're not the enemy.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.874
We just need a chance
to prove it.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.809
Please, can you broker a meeting
with your government?

21:16.843 --> 21:18.010
Everything's at stake.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.515
LIAM:
RE/SYST.

21:22.549 --> 21:23.716
The hacker group sent you
the photo unsolicited?

21:23.750 --> 21:25.352
Yeah.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.554
And so how do I get
in touch with them?

21:27.587 --> 21:29.422
You can't.
That's my source.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.790
They're underground.
Did they say

21:30.823 --> 21:31.858
who they got the photo from?

21:31.891 --> 21:33.560
No.

21:33.593 --> 21:34.794
But...

21:34.827 --> 21:35.962
whatever Atlas is,

21:35.995 --> 21:37.764
it nearly got me killed, Liam.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.800
A car came out of nowhere
and hit me head-on.

21:40.833 --> 21:41.934
Holy crap.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.103
Yeah.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.339
When I met you that first night,

21:46.373 --> 21:48.375
I started out just
looking for a big story.

21:48.408 --> 21:51.110
But now I'm really just looking
for the truth.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.879
So...

21:52.912 --> 21:54.714
what was that bruise
that Jillian saw on you?

21:56.115 --> 21:59.719
Well, you know, I...
I already told you.

21:59.752 --> 22:02.589
I'm Darius's new head
of security, so sometimes,

22:02.622 --> 22:04.657
sometimes I get
into scrapes.
Mm.

22:04.691 --> 22:05.492
I do. Sometimes I do.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.661
(laughs): Okay.
(laughs)

22:08.695 --> 22:10.497
She felt like you were
hiding something,

22:10.530 --> 22:12.064
and I have the
same feeling.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.466
So what I
want to know is

22:13.500 --> 22:14.634
what's your secret?

22:18.871 --> 22:21.574
I gave up everything.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.676
You gave me nothing.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.077
How is that fair?

22:25.111 --> 22:26.846
No one said life was fair.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.848
You're lucky you're cute

22:28.881 --> 22:30.717
or else you'd be a dead man
right now.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.084
Are you threatening me?

22:32.118 --> 22:33.653
I'm more dangerous than I look.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.488
Yeah, I do not doubt that
for a minute.

22:35.522 --> 22:36.656
(laughs)

22:36.689 --> 22:38.825
So?

22:38.858 --> 22:41.828
I should get something
for my troubles, no?

22:41.861 --> 22:44.997
Well, it only seems fair.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.493
I should probably
be heading home

23:13.526 --> 23:14.994
before I do anything stupid.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.497
Is this stupid?

23:17.530 --> 23:19.466
Well, you know, I don't want you
to think that I'm easy.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.434
Mm. (laughs)

23:21.468 --> 23:22.902
Can we get
the check, please?

23:31.511 --> 23:33.045
A business trip
with Darius Tanz?

23:33.079 --> 23:34.514
ZOE:
Yeah.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.616
Figured she told you
since you're her boss.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.785
Right.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.853
I must have just confused
the dates, that's all.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.622
If you speak to her,

23:42.655 --> 23:43.790
can you tell her
I'm looking for her

23:43.823 --> 23:44.891
and it's important?

23:44.924 --> 23:45.892
Of course. Yeah.

23:45.925 --> 23:46.959
Thanks.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.495
Oh.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.129
Mr. Edwards?

23:50.162 --> 23:52.599
I'm glad I finally
got to meet you.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.001
Glad I got to meet you,
too, Zoe.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.775
(door opens)

24:05.244 --> 24:06.979
(siren wailing in distance)

24:10.016 --> 24:13.620
This is best room I have,
honeymoon suite.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.187
Oh. Yeah, it's lovely.

24:15.221 --> 24:18.024
Thank you.

24:18.057 --> 24:21.193
We like quiet, Valentina.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.763
Oh, quiet you shall have.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.537
Not my usual
five-star haunt,

24:30.570 --> 24:31.971
but we're trying to keep
a low profile.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.873
One bed.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.274
Couldn't spring for a double?
Oh, don't worry.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.577
I, um, I don't sleep.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.515
Wow.

24:42.549 --> 24:44.050
This place probably
hasn't been renovated

24:44.083 --> 24:45.952
since Lenin slept here.

24:45.985 --> 24:46.953
(line ringing)

24:46.986 --> 24:48.020
LIAM:
Hello.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.856
It's me.

24:49.889 --> 24:51.858
Yeah, good timing. I cribbed
a ton of photos from Amanda.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.192
I'm going through them
right now.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.594
That photo,
the one with the rock,

24:54.627 --> 24:55.828
I need to know exactly
where it was taken.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.530
Tess has
a geo-recognition program.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.198
Have her locate any photos

24:59.231 --> 25:00.700
posted on social media

25:00.733 --> 25:02.635
that match the imagery
in that picture.

25:02.669 --> 25:03.703
I'll need a few hours.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.104
Tell Tess to work quickly.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.239
That photo is key to everything.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.948
(car horn honking)

25:19.118 --> 25:20.787
GRACE: Oh, it's
been three hours.

25:20.820 --> 25:21.988
What if she
changes her mind?

25:22.021 --> 25:24.123
How would we even know?

25:24.156 --> 25:26.859
Darius, what are you doing?

25:26.893 --> 25:28.094
Of course you are.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.596
Anna Karenina.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.598
Much better
in the native tongue.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.633
Spoiler alert,
she kills herself.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.635
Pass me one of those
burner phones.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.204
Thanks.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.013
Hello?

25:47.046 --> 25:48.180
Hi, baby, it's me.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.348
Just checking in.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.751
Mom, I've been trying
to reach you.

25:51.784 --> 25:54.887
Uh, sorry, I... my phone died.

25:54.921 --> 25:57.890
Harris came by looking for you.

25:57.924 --> 26:00.092
He did?

26:00.126 --> 26:02.094
He had no idea where you were.

26:02.128 --> 26:05.264
Well, we must have gotten
our lines crossed.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.867
Yeah.

26:07.900 --> 26:11.270
Uh, he said it's really
important that you call him.

26:11.303 --> 26:14.340
Honey, I may need to
stay an extra day.

26:14.373 --> 26:15.708
Are you good?

26:15.742 --> 26:17.977
Yeah.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.278
Are you?

26:21.948 --> 26:23.282
Of course.

26:23.315 --> 26:24.751
I love you.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.653
Me, too.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.097
Harris came by
looking for me.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.132
He's never done
that before.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.033
What do you make of it?

26:41.067 --> 26:42.234
Nothing good.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.709
To drink or not to drink.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.177
That is the question.

26:51.210 --> 26:54.714
I always say if you have to ask,
you probably need one.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.292
(typing)

27:09.395 --> 27:11.363
*

27:27.446 --> 27:29.682
(exhales)

27:30.950 --> 27:32.685
(rock music playing)

27:34.987 --> 27:36.355
(message dings)

27:53.405 --> 27:56.809
GRACE: Something
bad's going down,

27:56.843 --> 27:58.377
otherwise Harris wouldn't risk
outing himself to Zoe.

27:58.410 --> 28:01.948
You've never talked
to her about Harris?

28:01.981 --> 28:04.183
Not until last night.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.417
So, you've gone public
with it?

28:05.451 --> 28:06.719
To a point.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.187
Not Calhoun or Claire.

28:08.220 --> 28:12.091
Oh, I feel privileged to be
among those in the know.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.493
You don't like him.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.729
I like him.
I just don't trust him.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.364
He stepped outside the lines
at great risk to himself

28:18.397 --> 28:20.299
to get that crystal
for the EmDrive.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.769
And showed the fair maiden he
could be a prince, after all.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.036
Bravo.
Okay.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.337
(laughs):
I don't know

28:25.371 --> 28:27.139
who you think he was
15 years ago.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.474
He's not that same guy.

28:28.507 --> 28:30.142
He's evolved.

28:30.176 --> 28:32.111
Harris is a company man
through and through.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.312
It's in his DNA.

28:33.345 --> 28:34.781
Something he can't change.

28:34.814 --> 28:38.050
DNA might not
change; people do.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.118
(knock on door)

28:44.456 --> 28:46.158
What's it say?
Katya's arranged for us

28:46.192 --> 28:47.526
to meet with
the minister of defense.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.929
There's a car waiting
with instructions inside.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.330
Before we go...

28:51.363 --> 28:52.899
Hello?

28:52.932 --> 28:54.300
TANZ:
Liam, what did you find?

28:54.333 --> 28:56.135
Yeah, the photo was taken
in Russia.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.971
Tess was able to find the park
where the photo was shot.

28:59.005 --> 29:01.540
It's located
at these coordinates:

29:01.573 --> 29:04.210
55.2030 degrees north,

29:04.243 --> 29:07.213
61.5206 degrees east.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.015
TANZ:
Okay, which is where exactly?

29:09.048 --> 29:10.950
The strangest of places:
Chelyabinsk.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.921
We've been working
on impact prevention

29:14.954 --> 29:17.123
since Chelyabinsk
back in 2013.

29:17.156 --> 29:19.358
That process has
now been expedited.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.131
Were you able to date
that photo at all?

29:25.164 --> 29:26.365
Yeah, February 2013.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.367
Isn't that when...?
Yes.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.902
Can you track down the source?

29:29.936 --> 29:31.570
Yeah.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.907
Give me the bad news
before you start slurring.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.575
You might want to sit down.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.811
The reason all this
is happening--

29:38.845 --> 29:40.179
Russia closing
their embassy,

29:40.212 --> 29:42.248
threatening war if we
launch anything into space--

29:42.281 --> 29:45.317
is because they're afraid
we might do it again.

29:45.351 --> 29:46.252
Do what again?

29:46.285 --> 29:47.887
Revive Project Atlas, Grace.

29:47.920 --> 29:48.955
That photo

29:48.988 --> 29:50.389
was taken in Chelyabinsk.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.025
Where the meteor hit Russia
in 2013.

29:53.059 --> 29:56.095
Exactly, except that meteor
strike was no natural disaster.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.329
It was a weapon

29:57.363 --> 29:59.598
wielded by America
using...

29:59.631 --> 30:02.434
(sighs)
my guidance system.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.203
So Katya was right.

30:04.236 --> 30:06.939
Atlas is a weapons program.

30:06.973 --> 30:09.375
Yes, except the weapon...

30:09.408 --> 30:10.977
was an asteroid.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.379
And we crashed it into Russia?

30:15.447 --> 30:18.985
Oh, my God.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.519
We're the bad guys.

30:34.901 --> 30:36.202
I need to speak to
Darius. Where is he?

30:36.235 --> 30:37.603
I'm not at liberty to say.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.405
You will lose your
liberty if you don't.

30:39.438 --> 30:40.940
This is a matter of
national security.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.408
It can't wait.

30:42.441 --> 30:43.910
He's not here.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.411
He took a jet and didn't
tell me where he went.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.192
No wonder the Russians
don't trust us,

31:00.226 --> 31:02.028
not after what we've done.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.964
If by "we" you mean the U.S.
government, then I agree.

31:04.997 --> 31:08.334
My friend Walter Carnahan,

31:08.367 --> 31:10.602
he stumbled across Atlas
and was murdered.

31:10.636 --> 31:11.971
Our government killed him
rather than

31:12.004 --> 31:13.605
let out their dirty secret
and risk...

31:13.639 --> 31:16.142
Starting World War III,
ironically.

31:16.175 --> 31:17.309
And now here we are.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.211
But we still don't know
who was involved.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.679
I mean, the president, anyone.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.349
Anyone could be culpable
or innocent.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.084
I can't believe Harris
would be complicit

31:25.117 --> 31:26.518
in something this evil.

31:26.552 --> 31:27.553
If NASA launches
the gravity tractor,

31:27.586 --> 31:29.989
then the Russians will blow it
out of the sky.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.157
Thinking we're trying
to weaponize another asteroid.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.491
But if Tanz Industries

31:32.524 --> 31:34.193
were to launch it
as a private entity

31:34.226 --> 31:35.962
with Russian oversight...

31:35.995 --> 31:38.364
We'd have a chance
of setting everything right.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.167
They don't need to trust
the United States.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.501
They need to trust us.

31:50.442 --> 31:51.577
Where's Darius?
Hey, what are you doing here?

31:51.610 --> 31:53.379
Where's Darius?
Gone.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.580
With Grace?

31:54.613 --> 31:56.515
Don't put me in
the middle here.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.089
Where did you get these?

32:03.122 --> 32:04.190
Amanda Neel.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.357
The reporter?
Yeah.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.425
She doesn't know I have them.

32:06.458 --> 32:07.426
Don't ask.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.367
Okay, where are Grace
and Darius?

32:15.401 --> 32:16.735
If I plead the Fifth,

32:16.768 --> 32:18.570
are you gonna arrest me?
'Cause I still

32:18.604 --> 32:20.506
have to finish the EmDrive.
Damn it, Liam,

32:20.539 --> 32:21.573
they might be in trouble,
and I can't help them

32:21.607 --> 32:23.242
if I don't know where they are.

32:25.411 --> 32:26.578
Moscow.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.314
(chuckles softly)

32:28.347 --> 32:31.183
(quietly):
Oh, my God.

32:31.217 --> 32:33.252
Can you track them for me?

32:33.285 --> 32:35.154
No, they have a one-way burner.

32:35.187 --> 32:36.588
The second you hear from them,
you call me.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.124
That is an order from
the United States government.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.200
(siren wailing in distance)

33:07.219 --> 33:08.420
(doorbells jingle)

33:11.690 --> 33:13.525
I'm sorry.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.094
DANIEL:
No, no. That was, I...

33:15.127 --> 33:16.295
I didn't handle that well.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.030
Jillian.

33:18.064 --> 33:20.766
I just want you to know
that I love your father.

33:20.799 --> 33:23.335
And I'll never do anything
to come between the two of you.

33:23.369 --> 33:26.172
We're gonna wait to get married.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.806
Until you're ready.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.409
Don't wait.

33:30.442 --> 33:31.677
DANIEL:
What?

33:31.710 --> 33:33.112
I mean,
there's no time

33:33.145 --> 33:34.546
like the present.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.415
And I want you
both to be happy.

33:36.448 --> 33:37.816
Oh, girl. Come here.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.285
What...

33:40.819 --> 33:43.222
Shh.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.156
(kisses)

33:46.125 --> 33:47.393
Oh, hey, I
almost forgot.

33:47.426 --> 33:50.496
You never told me
your big news.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.499
Oh, um...

33:53.532 --> 33:55.601
I quit my job.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.436
And my boyfriend.

33:57.469 --> 34:00.372
But I'm staying
right where I belong.

34:00.406 --> 34:04.143
Here, with my family.

34:04.176 --> 34:07.346
Oh, you.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.115
Mm.
(kisses)

34:10.249 --> 34:12.184
(exhales)

34:14.186 --> 34:16.188
Okay, Tess.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.524
The hackers used
a VPN to mask their IP address.

34:18.557 --> 34:19.725
Can you find it?

34:19.758 --> 34:21.393
TESS:
Scanning now.

34:23.429 --> 34:24.630
Tess, what's up?

34:24.663 --> 34:25.797
The encryptions
are multi-tiered.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.466
Oh, come on.

34:27.499 --> 34:29.335
They haven't met you, though.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.837
(computer trilling)

34:31.870 --> 34:32.771
You got it?

34:32.804 --> 34:35.541
The photo was sent
from a computer terminal

34:35.574 --> 34:37.409
located at this address.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.111
Thank you.

34:43.449 --> 34:44.850
If they're willing
to hear us out,

34:44.883 --> 34:46.518
why all the
cloak and dagger?

34:46.552 --> 34:48.587
Because they can't afford
to be seen dealing with us

34:48.620 --> 34:50.656
any more than we can be seen
dealing with them.

34:50.689 --> 34:53.592
At least, not until we
lock down an agreement.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.228
Okay, this is the spot.
She said there'd be

34:56.262 --> 34:58.397
a blue compact waiting for us.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.731
Right there.
That's it?

34:59.765 --> 35:01.400
I figured the ambassador

35:01.433 --> 35:02.834
would send us
a Dartz Prombron.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.370
Gold-plated trim,

35:04.403 --> 35:06.872
diamond-encrusted gauges,

35:06.905 --> 35:08.874
whale penis leather seats...
Please tell me you're kidding.

35:08.907 --> 35:10.242
I'm not actually.

35:15.647 --> 35:16.782
Grace.
(gasps)

35:16.815 --> 35:17.583
Move out of
the way, move!

35:20.819 --> 35:21.920
(horn blaring)

35:21.953 --> 35:24.156
Darius.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.591
(car alarm blaring)

35:25.624 --> 35:27.326
We need to get out of here, now.

35:38.404 --> 35:40.239
You all right?

35:40.272 --> 35:41.673
We need to move fast.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.442
Grab our passports and go.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.678
I can't believe Katya
would betray us like that.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.480
I'm not sure she did.

35:53.752 --> 35:54.853
No. No, Katya, no.

35:54.886 --> 35:55.854
Don't, don't,
don't, don't.

35:55.887 --> 35:58.390
TANZ: Jaundice.
It could be polonium poisoning.

35:58.424 --> 36:01.193
She might be radioactive.
She has a daughter.

36:01.227 --> 36:03.362
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

36:03.395 --> 36:04.896
(sirens wailing)
Grace.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.466
There's no time for emotions,
we need to grab our passports,

36:07.499 --> 36:09.401
and get the hell to my plane.

36:09.435 --> 36:11.603
Darius, I can't just leave her.
Grace, Grace, she's gone!

36:11.637 --> 36:13.605
She's gone. And we're gonna
be arrested for her murder

36:13.639 --> 36:15.874
if we don't
get out of here.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.609
Now, go.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.785
So, what exactly happened
at your facility

36:26.818 --> 36:29.621
on the 19th at
approximately 2350 hours?

36:29.655 --> 36:30.822
Sir?
At ease, Lieutenant.

36:30.856 --> 36:31.923
This is just a routine check

36:31.957 --> 36:33.592
of our security
procedures.

36:33.625 --> 36:34.960
What protocols
did you complete

36:34.993 --> 36:37.729
prior to the release
of that enriched uranium?

36:37.763 --> 36:39.431
Every single one of them, sir.

36:39.465 --> 36:41.533
Ms. Barrows
had the proper access code.

36:41.567 --> 36:42.801
Then I called you

36:42.834 --> 36:44.603
to personally verify
authorization.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.004
And you spoke to me?
Yes, sir.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.439
There's a record of the call
in the log.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.511
And I gave my personal code?

36:52.544 --> 36:54.580
Absolutely, sir.
That's odd, I
have no record

36:54.613 --> 36:55.947
of that call on my phone.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.916
My cell didn't
record it, either.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.486
There must be a glitch
in the Tanz O.S. upgrade.

37:00.519 --> 37:01.987
(phone ringing)

37:04.890 --> 37:06.892
Hmm. Could've sworn
that was me.
Nope, that's me.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.794
Sorry, I should
actually take this.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.962
(exhales)

37:10.996 --> 37:12.631
That must be it.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.433
You know, my son
always says never

37:14.466 --> 37:17.803
to download an update the
same day it's released.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.671
Thank you, Lieutenant.
That will be all.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.877
(door closes)

37:25.911 --> 37:28.013
(sighs)

37:36.888 --> 37:38.957
Yes, this is Harris Edwards,
authorization code:

37:38.990 --> 37:42.928
89564, Zulu, Bravo.

37:42.961 --> 37:45.364
Suspend Grace Barrows's
A4 security clearance

37:45.397 --> 37:47.733
until further notice,
effective immediately.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.745
(sighs)

38:05.351 --> 38:06.017
(phone beeps)

38:12.524 --> 38:15.961
Hi, it's Jillian.

38:15.994 --> 38:19.431
Yes, I know.
It's been a while.

38:19.465 --> 38:22.033
Something's happened,
or happening.

38:24.703 --> 38:27.339
I was hoping we could talk.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.844
(siren wailing in distance)

38:36.715 --> 38:37.983
(train horn blows)

38:40.051 --> 38:42.320
(pounding on door)

38:50.729 --> 38:51.797
This way.

38:55.401 --> 38:56.435
(door slams)

39:05.043 --> 39:06.845
(percussive electronic music
playing)

39:11.683 --> 39:13.585
(music grows louder)

39:25.797 --> 39:27.633
Liam Cole.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.568
Welcome to RE/SYST.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.136
We've been waiting for you.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.845
(footsteps approaching)

39:39.878 --> 39:43.449
Someone once said the two
most powerful warriors

39:43.482 --> 39:44.816
are patience and time.

39:44.850 --> 39:45.884
Who was that?

39:47.218 --> 39:48.654
A Russian.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.556
Leo Tolstoy.

39:50.589 --> 39:52.123
Too bad we have neither.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.725
My contact in Moscow

39:53.759 --> 39:56.828
just told me that Katya Osinov
was murdered.

39:56.862 --> 39:59.765
Well, that's one less player
on the board.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.433
Is that all?

40:01.467 --> 40:02.634
Not quite.

40:02.668 --> 40:04.202
Her body was found
in a hotel room

40:04.235 --> 40:07.639
booked by two Americans,
who came in on a private jet.

40:07.673 --> 40:09.040
A man and a woman.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.176
Grace Barrows and Darius Tanz
are in Russia?

40:11.209 --> 40:14.212
Apparently.
Well, then, that's good news.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.682
Because we might be able to kill
off two birds with one stone

40:16.715 --> 40:17.983
without lifting a finger.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.631
Wait here.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.568
(newscaster speaking in Russian)

40:36.602 --> 40:38.737
Grace.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.539
(newscaster speaking in Russian)

40:48.046 --> 40:50.048
Darius, they're
gonna frame us.

40:50.081 --> 40:51.850
Give me your passport.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.819
What? Why?

40:55.186 --> 40:57.122
No. No way.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.757
What are you doing?

41:00.892 --> 41:02.928
Without our papers,
we're nobody.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.796
That's exactly
who we have to be

41:04.830 --> 41:06.532
if we want to get
out of here alive.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.500
Keep your head down.
