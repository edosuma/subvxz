01:45.237 --> 01:46.637
Hey, I've been
looking for you.

01:46.639 --> 01:49.205
Yeah. Uh...

01:49.207 --> 01:50.641
Been trying to steer
clear of Coach.

01:50.643 --> 01:52.277
Are you sick?

01:53.412 --> 01:55.146
Are you nervous?

01:56.248 --> 01:58.248
You think he's here?

01:58.250 --> 01:59.650
- Dad doesn't...
- I don't care about Dad.

01:59.652 --> 02:01.518
I'm talking about
the Florida scout.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.487
Why would there be
a Florida scout here?

02:03.489 --> 02:06.558
'Cause that Jenkins kid from the
other team, his dad's a Gator scout.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.661
If he's here, this could be
my only chance to be seen.

02:09.663 --> 02:12.963
Dave, this is...
this is it.

02:12.965 --> 02:15.733
You're going to be the best
player out there and you know it.

02:15.735 --> 02:18.304
It doesn't matter if there's
no one there to watch it.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.142
Yeah!

02:29.583 --> 02:31.752
All right, boys.
Keep that front line, baby.

02:36.288 --> 02:38.255
Come on, now,
is this a team or what?

02:38.257 --> 02:40.257
Come on. You ready
to break this thing down?

02:40.259 --> 02:41.558
- We got the beat!
- Yeah!

02:41.560 --> 02:43.260
- It's in our feet!
- Yeah!

02:43.262 --> 02:44.496
- It's in our hair!
- Yeah!

02:44.498 --> 02:45.997
- It's everywhere!
- Yeah!

02:45.999 --> 02:47.365
- They want it!
- Yeah!

02:47.367 --> 02:48.600
- But we got it!
- Yeah!

02:48.602 --> 02:49.834
- They couldn't beat it!
- Yeah!

02:49.836 --> 02:51.403
- Unless they treat it!
- Yeah!

02:51.405 --> 02:52.737
- I must confess!
- Yeah!

02:52.739 --> 02:54.305
- That we're the best!
- Yeah!

02:54.307 --> 02:55.640
- The mighty Rebels!
- Yeah!

02:55.642 --> 02:57.009
- The mighty Rebels!
- Yeah!

02:57.011 --> 02:58.778
- The mighty Rebels!
- Yeah!

02:58.780 --> 03:01.378
- Come on, Truett, break this thing down for me!
- Yes, sir, Coach!

03:01.380 --> 03:04.216
Come on. It's on! It's on!

03:08.555 --> 03:13.258
Come on, now! Come on, now!
Come on, now! Come on, now!

03:13.260 --> 03:14.659
- Come on, now! Come on, now!
- Let's go.

03:14.661 --> 03:16.528
Hey, hey, hey.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.232
Truett. I know you didn't forget
how to break this team down.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.703
- Goose call on three! One, two, three!
- Hoo!

03:23.705 --> 03:25.637
- One, two, three!
- Hoo!

03:25.639 --> 03:27.639
- One, two, three!
- Hoo!

03:27.641 --> 03:29.607
- One, two, three!
- Hoo!

03:29.609 --> 03:32.343
- One, two, three!
- Hoo!

03:46.627 --> 03:48.460
- Get used to it!
- That's right.

03:50.630 --> 03:51.598
- All break.
- Break!

03:52.699 --> 03:54.599
He's right there!

04:10.919 --> 04:12.918
Shake it! Come on, baby!

04:16.322 --> 04:17.890
Yeah!

04:20.428 --> 04:21.462
We did it!

04:25.800 --> 04:27.700
How many touchdowns you gonna
give me tonight, Truett?

04:27.702 --> 04:29.668
As many as they let me.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.841
- Come on, Truett!
- Yeah, man!

04:35.711 --> 04:38.110
Go, go, go, go!

04:41.549 --> 04:42.850
He's going home!

04:45.821 --> 04:46.755
Yeah!

04:57.566 --> 04:58.901
Good game,
good game, good game.

05:08.777 --> 05:11.645
- Whoo!
- Hey, Coach. Coach!

05:11.647 --> 05:12.581
Coach!

05:14.683 --> 05:16.485
Did you see that
Florida coach out there?

05:17.486 --> 05:18.687
No, I didn't see one.

05:19.956 --> 05:22.457
Really? I mean,
he was wearing a Gators hat.

05:23.759 --> 05:25.859
You sure
you didn't see him?

05:25.861 --> 05:28.695
Look, you want to get noticed,
you take this team to State.

05:28.697 --> 05:30.730
All right. Every D1 scout
will be at the playoffs.

05:30.732 --> 05:32.632
- That's how you get seen.
- Yes, sir.

05:32.634 --> 05:34.503
Great game tonight,
Truett.

05:43.478 --> 05:45.613
You're the first person I've
seen to score four touchdowns...

05:45.615 --> 05:47.814
Five touchdowns, man.

05:47.816 --> 05:50.550
Five touchdowns, and still look
like someone ran over your dog.

05:50.552 --> 05:53.787
Dave, that scout was here,
and he left without saying a word.

05:53.789 --> 05:56.423
It was probably
'cause of that fumble.

05:56.425 --> 05:57.657
We still won, right?

06:58.923 --> 07:02.256
Hey, hey, hey. Go home.

07:02.258 --> 07:05.026
Zach, Zach. Hey.

07:05.028 --> 07:07.962
I wanna talk to you and your brother
about something. Will you let me in?

07:07.964 --> 07:09.832
You don't live here anymore.
You need to go.

07:11.902 --> 07:13.003
You let me in.

07:14.570 --> 07:16.071
Get off my porch.

07:16.073 --> 07:17.572
Let me in.

07:17.574 --> 07:19.274
Zach, you know
that it's my porch.

07:19.276 --> 07:21.845
It's not your porch.
You don't live here anymore, you drunk!

07:23.080 --> 07:24.979
- Let me in.
- Stop.

07:24.981 --> 07:27.817
I'm gonna give you three seconds
to open up this door.

07:28.618 --> 07:29.485
One...

07:31.689 --> 07:32.522
Two...

07:43.567 --> 07:44.935
You don't think I will?

07:48.738 --> 07:50.040
Get off my porch.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.755
It's good seeing you, son.

08:36.154 --> 08:39.054
<i>Where are all these
folks going in such a hurry?</i>

08:39.057 --> 08:42.991
<i>Well, the ones using this
road are going to Los Angeles.</i>

08:42.994 --> 08:46.062
<i>That is more automobiles than I've
ever seen in all my born days.</i>

08:46.064 --> 08:47.764
<i>Going so fast.</i>

08:47.766 --> 08:49.866
<i>Sure is good they's
going the same way.</i>

08:49.868 --> 08:52.201
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

08:52.203 --> 08:55.071
<i>'Cause if one of them rascals
decides to turn around and head back,</i>

08:55.073 --> 08:56.806
<i>there's gonna be an awful mess.</i>

09:08.887 --> 09:11.821
What are you doing out here?
Jesus.

09:11.823 --> 09:14.657
- Couldn't sleep.
- The bat?

09:14.659 --> 09:18.761
You never know when a scout
for the Yankees might pop by.

09:18.763 --> 09:21.899
What? There are coyotes, man. I was
trying to save you from getting eaten.

09:21.901 --> 09:24.700
- Shouldn't you be going?
- Why? You want to come with me?

09:24.702 --> 09:28.104
I want to sleep, which'll be a lot easier
when you're not here trying to talk to me.

09:28.106 --> 09:29.639
All right,
I'll see you later.

09:29.641 --> 09:33.711
Okay.
<i>♪ Good-bye, good-bye ♪</i>

10:13.252 --> 10:17.020
All right, muscles. Look at him.
Hit that bench. You've been benching.

10:17.022 --> 10:18.789
- Dave.
- Wonderful seeing you.

10:18.791 --> 10:20.858
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

10:20.860 --> 10:23.827
Listen, I want you to tell
your brother that I said hey.

10:23.829 --> 10:28.066
I'm trying to get him back down
here so you can tell him yourself.

10:28.068 --> 10:32.804
We're all works in progress.
Zach's a work in progress.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.173
He sure is. Thank you, Pastor.
Have a nice day.

10:35.175 --> 10:36.108
Yes, sir.

10:40.746 --> 10:43.181
- You're doing good work with those boys.
- Thank you.

10:43.183 --> 10:46.783
Yeah. Two steps forward,
one step back.

10:46.785 --> 10:49.788
- As long as we keep moving.
- Keep moving.

11:27.928 --> 11:29.729
<i>Ha!</i>

11:40.074 --> 11:43.309
- With a running form like you have...
- <i>Yeah. Perfect.</i>

11:43.311 --> 11:47.146
...I was trying to figure out, like,
what sport suits you the best, you know?

11:47.148 --> 11:49.847
<i>And, uh,
what conclusion did you come to?</i>

11:49.849 --> 11:52.085
<i>Did you find anything you thought
would work particularly well?</i>

11:53.220 --> 11:55.088
Yeah, like,
women's cricket.

11:55.922 --> 11:57.057
Let it go!

12:05.166 --> 12:06.999
All right, fellas.
Good game. See you.

12:07.001 --> 12:09.268
Truett. Truett!

12:09.270 --> 12:10.903
Yes, Coach?

12:10.905 --> 12:12.906
- I need to talk to you.
- Yes, sir.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.010
Now look.

12:18.012 --> 12:21.146
I know you said how important it
is for you to get a scholarship,

12:21.148 --> 12:23.215
and you have absolutely
worked your tail off this year.

12:23.217 --> 12:25.353
I'm proud of you.
All right, Simms.

12:27.188 --> 12:29.021
- Mr. Polack.
- Coach.

12:29.023 --> 12:31.291
Thank you. I appreciate
you saying that.

12:31.293 --> 12:34.929
But what did I tell you is the best way
to get seen by these coaches and scouts?

12:36.863 --> 12:40.199
Um, take the team
to State?

12:40.201 --> 12:42.136
Don't you forget it.

12:42.937 --> 12:44.270
Yes, sir.

12:44.272 --> 12:46.171
This came for you
in the mail today.

12:46.173 --> 12:49.174
Congrats. You're
on somebody's radar, son.

12:49.176 --> 12:50.312
What?

12:59.954 --> 13:02.121
Bring any marshmallows?

13:02.123 --> 13:03.357
We're out.

13:06.361 --> 13:08.062
We gonna talk about
this, or what?

13:08.929 --> 13:09.864
What?

13:10.432 --> 13:11.964
Your letter.

13:13.168 --> 13:14.269
What about it?

13:15.904 --> 13:17.306
I'm just
really proud of you.

13:18.940 --> 13:20.307
Thanks, man.

13:20.309 --> 13:23.242
I mean,
it's not a big deal.

13:23.244 --> 13:25.412
It's just a letter saying
that there's interest...

13:25.414 --> 13:28.947
- Shut up. It's happening.
- You're right. It's a big deal, dude.

13:28.949 --> 13:30.650
It's the Florida Gators.

13:30.652 --> 13:33.153
The Florida Gators.

13:33.155 --> 13:35.388
It's cool, man.

13:35.390 --> 13:40.393
I mean, it just shows that it's not some fantasy
that I've built up in my head, you know?

13:40.395 --> 13:43.098
- It's real.
- It's happening.

13:44.367 --> 13:45.368
We'll see.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.341
Yeah, I'm gonna get
that scholarship.

13:55.110 --> 13:57.012
I'm gonna get us out of here.
You have my word.

14:01.917 --> 14:04.220
And we'll get better cereal
once we're out.

14:25.007 --> 14:28.509
Excuse me. Is there, like,
a Coke machine around here or something?

14:28.511 --> 14:33.981
Yeah. Follow this main hall back around
to the cafeteria. There's one there.

14:33.983 --> 14:36.249
Aren't you a little young
to be a nurse?

14:36.251 --> 14:40.287
Not to be a nurse intern
though, which is what I am.

14:40.289 --> 14:43.090
Okay, that makes sense.
I'm Zach.

14:43.092 --> 14:45.928
Zach Truett,
the running back at Bessemer.

14:46.429 --> 14:47.495
That's great.

14:47.497 --> 14:49.365
Yeah. We are undefeated,
you know?

14:51.134 --> 14:52.501
All right.

14:52.503 --> 14:55.169
Zach, it's been really nice
to meet you.

14:55.171 --> 14:58.340
Best part of my day,
but I don't date football players.

14:58.342 --> 15:00.274
Ouch.

15:00.276 --> 15:02.343
I was thinking about getting two
Cokes from that Coke machine.

15:02.345 --> 15:04.745
Now I'm not so sure.
I might just have to get one.

15:04.747 --> 15:07.415
- I'm a Dr. Pepper girl, so...
- See, that's a shame.

15:07.417 --> 15:10.386
- Ginger, can I get an IV in five?
- Yep. On it.

15:11.555 --> 15:13.355
I'm gonna convert you.

15:13.357 --> 15:15.191
Take care.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.760
- I think she digs me. What do you think?
- Yo.

15:18.762 --> 15:21.029
Hey. What's up, man?
How did it go?

15:21.031 --> 15:23.765
Went for an annual checkup.
I'm 45 days without any problems, so...

15:23.767 --> 15:25.767
That's good. Did they give you
a lollipop and a sticker too?

15:25.769 --> 15:27.301
Not this time.

15:27.303 --> 15:29.336
You didn't by chance have a
really hot nurse, did you?

15:29.338 --> 15:32.206
Like, 75 years old,
smoker's cough, gray hair.

15:32.208 --> 15:33.207
Nope.
Martha?

15:33.209 --> 15:35.477
Martha's all yours, bud.

15:35.479 --> 15:37.112
<i>Hey, Bessemer fans.</i>

15:37.114 --> 15:40.315
<i>You're witnessing something special
here tonight with Zach Truett.</i>

15:40.317 --> 15:44.486
<i>203 yards, two more touchdowns
in the fourth quarter,</i>

15:44.488 --> 15:48.623
<i>and the boy is putting together a
season like, well, I've never seen.</i>

15:48.625 --> 15:52.194
I'm hungry.
I was kinda feeling like salmon.

15:52.196 --> 15:54.129
- You want some salmon?
- I like salmon.

15:54.131 --> 15:56.398
- That's a high-class meal, dude.
- I know. I can't really cook salmon.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.400
Good luck with that.
I want some noodles.

15:58.402 --> 16:01.104
- What kind of noodles?
- Like, some ramen noodles, dude.

16:03.575 --> 16:04.542
Hey, Truett!

16:05.477 --> 16:07.510
We got room for one more.

16:07.512 --> 16:10.045
What are you guys
doing here?

16:10.047 --> 16:12.447
Hey.
Could you cover for me?

16:12.449 --> 16:15.250
- It's getting old.
- No, I know, but...

16:15.252 --> 16:16.618
The train is leaving.

16:16.620 --> 16:18.553
All right.
One sec, one sec.

16:18.555 --> 16:23.526
Come on, it will be just one hour.
If Nanny asks, I'm icing my... you know?

16:23.528 --> 16:25.495
- All right.
- Thank you, man. Love ya.

16:25.497 --> 16:27.597
- Ah!
- Whoo!

16:27.599 --> 16:30.132
- What's up, fellas?
- Get in there.

16:30.134 --> 16:31.369
Ah!

16:47.519 --> 16:49.354
I brought you guys
some soup.

16:52.290 --> 16:54.423
Hey, Nanny.
Did you say something?

16:54.425 --> 16:57.159
I brought you some soup.
Homemade.

16:57.161 --> 16:59.160
Chicken and dumplings,
just like you like.

16:59.162 --> 17:01.430
- You're awesome.
- Where's Zach?

17:01.432 --> 17:07.369
He's icing his leg.
He should be back by 10:30 though.

17:07.372 --> 17:10.138
I heard he scored
five times.

17:10.141 --> 17:13.409
Yeah, it was almost six.
You should have been there.

17:13.411 --> 17:16.479
Well, I've seen enough football
to last me a lifetime.

17:16.481 --> 17:18.882
After watching you
take that hit last year?

17:18.884 --> 17:21.518
Them carting you
off the field.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.587
Your body all locked up the way it was.
No, thank you. No, sir.

17:24.589 --> 17:26.656
And then,
like a crazy woman,

17:26.657 --> 17:29.358
you jumped out of the stands and
ran out onto the field to help me.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.661
I wasn't coming
to tend to you.

17:31.663 --> 17:36.535
I was looking for that middle linebacker
who put you in the dirt with a cheap shot.

17:38.537 --> 17:42.172
I'm not afraid to give somebody
the business on a Friday,

17:42.174 --> 17:44.508
ask for forgiveness
on a Sunday.

17:44.510 --> 17:46.412
Good night, Nanny.

17:55.153 --> 18:00.657
Five, four, three,
two, one. Baby!

18:00.659 --> 18:03.560
Right on the dot.
It was a buzzer beater, but it's 10:27.

18:03.562 --> 18:05.395
- Yeah.
- How 'bout that?

18:05.397 --> 18:07.932
- Smells like you had a good time.
- It was one beer, Dad. Come on.

18:07.934 --> 18:10.400
Let's stack
some bathroom tissue.

18:10.402 --> 18:13.169
- Dude, those guys are the worst.
- You're the worst.

18:13.171 --> 18:15.672
- When you lie down with dogs...
- You wake up with fleas, Shakespeare.

18:15.674 --> 18:17.307
I get it. You can read.

18:17.309 --> 18:18.542
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

18:18.544 --> 18:20.777
Did Nanny ask about me?

18:20.779 --> 18:23.246
Yeah, yeah. She actually
made chicken and dumplings.

18:23.248 --> 18:25.582
Oh! So good.

18:25.584 --> 18:29.419
I'm never gonna find a lady that can make
chicken and dumplings the way Nanny can.

18:29.421 --> 18:31.756
It's a shame.
She's ruined me for all womankind.

18:31.758 --> 18:34.492
- It's a tragedy, really.
- It was good. I killed the whole thing.

18:34.494 --> 18:36.593
- You what?
- You were at your other thing.

18:36.595 --> 18:39.229
- Are you kidding me?
- I just figured you wouldn't mind.

18:39.231 --> 18:41.400
What are you thinking,
man?

18:42.801 --> 18:45.803
- Come on!
- All right, put me down! I'm mad at you, man.

18:45.805 --> 18:48.608
Stack your dog food, apron boy.
Get some work done.

18:53.346 --> 18:56.481
Here you go.
And it's on the house.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.750
You make sure you get us
a win this week, okay, Zach?

18:58.752 --> 19:03.487
You got it. And how about I dedicate
my first touchdown to you, my lady?

19:03.489 --> 19:05.290
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

19:06.291 --> 19:07.692
You're so cheesy.

19:07.694 --> 19:09.494
She smiled.

19:09.496 --> 19:12.296
Yeah. She also graduated high
school the year you were born.

19:12.298 --> 19:16.668
Oh, Davey. Age is no factor when
you have the gift of charm, brother.

19:16.670 --> 19:18.505
Let's eat
this free food.

19:20.573 --> 19:23.208
How you doin', buddy?
Good to see you. Hey.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.513
- You guys mind if I join you?
- Yeah.

19:28.515 --> 19:31.849
- Long time no see, Pop.
- I lost my appetite.

19:31.851 --> 19:35.319
You know, I come by.

19:35.321 --> 19:37.457
Now that you're not there,
this one won't let me in.

19:38.324 --> 19:39.459
Yeah, I figured.

19:41.261 --> 19:42.395
Why didn't you
say anything?

19:44.431 --> 19:46.367
Don't see why I'd waste
my breath on this guy.

19:50.870 --> 19:53.671
I heard you're doing real well on the
football field this season, Zachary.

19:53.673 --> 19:55.606
- Did you?
- Yeah.

19:55.608 --> 19:59.510
In fact, rumor has it that you're
gonna shatter all my district records.

19:59.512 --> 20:02.581
Yeah. No, I'm gonna wipe your
name off the record books.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.719
You can count on that.

20:09.457 --> 20:10.622
We're family.

20:10.624 --> 20:12.356
You think that's supposed
to mean something?

20:12.358 --> 20:14.592
- It does. It means everything.
- It means nothing.

20:14.594 --> 20:18.799
We're family. You're some dude
that left us after our mom died.

20:20.568 --> 20:22.603
Dave, let's go.

20:25.906 --> 20:26.841
Really?

20:30.845 --> 20:32.613
All right.
Forget you both.

21:05.813 --> 21:09.751
I got a question.
More like a favor to ask of you.

21:12.120 --> 21:15.420
I'm hoping...

21:15.422 --> 21:19.459
that maybe you could ask Nanny to
borrow a couple hundred dollars.

21:19.461 --> 21:23.529
You don't tell her it's for me.
I'll get it paid back as soon as I can.

21:23.531 --> 21:26.365
- I thought you just wanted to talk to us.
- Dude, that's what we're doing.

21:26.367 --> 21:28.935
You and I,
we're talking right now.

21:28.937 --> 21:33.940
Look, I got into it a little bit
with the manager at the site,

21:33.942 --> 21:36.409
so I'm temporarily
unemployed.

21:36.411 --> 21:38.845
I'm a few weeks behind
on my rent,

21:38.847 --> 21:41.783
and I just need a couple hundred
dollars to carry me through.

21:42.784 --> 21:45.953
And I'm just behind,
David.

21:45.955 --> 21:49.523
So, it would be helpful.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.527
It would be helpful.

22:02.804 --> 22:04.506
Get out of the road,
you loser!

22:07.009 --> 22:10.644
Touchdown Truett!
What you doing, bud?

22:10.646 --> 22:14.516
- I'm walking.
- I can see that. You need a ride?

22:15.784 --> 22:16.818
Where you headed?

22:18.854 --> 22:24.758
Get in.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.963
Get ready to live.

22:35.503 --> 22:36.872
You're like your mama.

22:38.875 --> 22:42.009
You got a good heart.

22:42.011 --> 22:47.915
Zachary, he's got that streak in him
he got from me, and so, just, you know?

22:47.917 --> 22:49.785
We'll just keep it
between you and me.

22:51.687 --> 22:56.657
Dad, I don't think I can
ask Nanny for any money.

22:56.659 --> 23:01.862
- You don't think you can?
- No, I can't ask Nanny for any money.

23:01.864 --> 23:04.399
So you won't ask Nanny
for money?

23:06.235 --> 23:07.436
No.

23:15.678 --> 23:18.581
Well...

23:21.518 --> 23:24.885
You gonna make this difficult on me too?
That's awesome. That's great.

23:44.074 --> 23:47.074
Yeah!

23:47.076 --> 23:49.944
Here we go.

23:49.946 --> 23:53.081
Special delivery. Cans full of courage.
Who wants some?

23:53.083 --> 23:55.016
- I got one.
- Hit me up right here.

23:55.018 --> 23:55.953
In that corner.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.288
- Zach, you want one, bud?
- No, I'm good, man.

24:00.290 --> 24:02.958
What? All right, man.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.727
More for us, man.
More for us.

24:05.729 --> 24:07.729
Why you always wear that
jersey when we come out here?

24:07.731 --> 24:10.934
Bro, I'm the Joe Montana
of cornholing. I told you.

24:24.715 --> 24:26.614
Here we go, baby.

24:32.991 --> 24:35.623
Get a little of that,
a little of this. Yeah!

24:36.560 --> 24:39.928
- Come on, baby. Good one!
- Are you kidding me?

24:39.930 --> 24:42.632
Who's next?
Are you next?

24:43.967 --> 24:45.767
- You?
- Line 'em up!

24:45.769 --> 24:48.170
If only you were as good at
football as you are at beer pong.

24:48.172 --> 24:50.706
What did you say?

24:50.708 --> 24:52.643
Truett think
he a five-star out here.

24:54.112 --> 24:56.612
Put up some hot numbers
against them little schools.

24:56.614 --> 25:00.682
That's right, I'll put 'em up against you
too next week at Edgewood if you like.

25:00.684 --> 25:02.650
What position you play?
Do you even play football?

25:02.652 --> 25:04.920
- Yeah, strong safety, actually.
- Not weak safety?

25:04.922 --> 25:07.056
Nah, you're gonna
remember that. Trust me.

25:07.058 --> 25:11.794
Will I? Maybe when I'm running you
over for one of my, what, two, three...

25:11.796 --> 25:15.164
Four, easy.
Four touchdowns.

25:15.166 --> 25:18.768
You can count them from
the sidelines if you like.

25:18.770 --> 25:21.938
- I'm-a go get another beer. You want one?
- No, you're not.

25:21.940 --> 25:23.806
- Hey, easy there.
- Don't let him disrespect you like that.

25:23.808 --> 25:25.074
Hit this fool, Truett.

25:25.076 --> 25:27.676
- You don't want me to hit you.
- Oh, yeah?

25:27.678 --> 25:31.113
Yeah. You got
that soft jaw.

25:31.115 --> 25:33.082
Runs in the family,
right?

25:33.084 --> 25:36.852
Yeah. This the dude
whose brother got knocked out.

25:36.854 --> 25:38.989
Oh!

25:38.991 --> 25:41.026
Who's got
that soft jaw now?

25:41.793 --> 25:42.693
All right.

25:43.862 --> 25:45.596
Say something.

25:51.102 --> 25:52.904
Aaah!

26:23.869 --> 26:25.669
<i>It looks like a torn ACL.</i>

26:25.671 --> 26:27.971
I won't know for sure
without an MRI,

26:27.973 --> 26:30.876
but either way, you're going
to need reconstructive surgery.

26:33.912 --> 26:35.080
I'll pay for it.

26:38.083 --> 26:41.885
Whatever your insurance doesn't pay
for, I'll cover the rest.

26:41.887 --> 26:45.958
- Nanny, you...
- If your mama was here, she'd see to it that you had it.

26:48.261 --> 26:53.164
As your godmother, you two are the
closest things I'll ever have to sons.

26:53.166 --> 26:55.967
So let me bless you
with this.

26:57.937 --> 26:59.970
Make up your own mind.
I'm not telling you what to do.

26:59.972 --> 27:01.738
Yes, ma'am.

27:01.740 --> 27:03.140
What is this?
You wanna tell me what this is?

27:03.142 --> 27:05.175
Move! Get out the way!
What is this?

27:05.177 --> 27:08.778
Somebody showed me this trash
about a half hour ago.

27:08.780 --> 27:11.182
Don't even try to explain it,
because you know what?

27:11.184 --> 27:13.985
This is on Facebook.
It's posted on Facebook.

27:13.987 --> 27:16.320
- So you know the UIL's gonna see it.
- Coach. It wasn't even my...

27:16.322 --> 27:18.222
What am I supposed to say?

27:18.224 --> 27:20.793
'Cause you know what they gonna do.
They can suspend you. Anything can...

27:21.995 --> 27:23.862
What's going on
with your knee?

27:25.964 --> 27:27.999
I don't know.

27:28.001 --> 27:29.766
I don't know.

27:29.768 --> 27:31.237
It looks like
a torn ACL, Coach.

27:33.907 --> 27:37.143
So this the end of our football season?
A chance for a scholarship for this boy.

27:42.949 --> 27:44.083
What were you thinking?

27:45.052 --> 27:47.819
What was on your mind?

27:49.289 --> 27:50.256
Exactly.

27:52.192 --> 27:54.260
Nothing. Unbelievable.

28:21.222 --> 28:24.189
Okay, mister.
Put this on.

28:24.191 --> 28:27.326
- Okay. Are you my nurse?
- Nope. Your nurse will be in shortly.

28:27.328 --> 28:29.296
Well, I hope she's
as friendly as you.

28:33.867 --> 28:34.801
Okay.

28:43.911 --> 28:45.577
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:45.579 --> 28:47.145
Are you my nurse intern?

28:47.147 --> 28:49.281
I am your nurse intern.
My name is...

28:49.283 --> 28:50.317
Ginger. Yeah.

28:51.586 --> 28:53.821
You don't date
football players.

28:56.258 --> 28:59.291
I'm sorry to hear about your
knee, Mr. Truett.

28:59.293 --> 29:01.028
I remember you telling me
how good you are.

29:04.431 --> 29:09.034
Hey, so how do you put this on?
Do you put it so that the butt is exposed?

29:09.036 --> 29:12.137
- Or flip it around like...
- Other way. We need your butt exposed.

29:12.139 --> 29:14.041
Wow. Quite forward.

29:16.910 --> 29:19.445
Let me specify.
The doctors need your back exposed.

29:19.447 --> 29:20.947
Oh, okay.

29:20.949 --> 29:23.348
You're feisty.
Very highbrow humor, Zach.

29:23.350 --> 29:25.851
- You smiled. I saw it.
- Mm-mmm.

29:25.853 --> 29:28.454
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah. I have a streak.

29:28.456 --> 29:30.256
Tomorrow's five months, no smiles.

29:30.258 --> 29:32.057
- Okay, well...
- Absolutely not.

29:32.059 --> 29:34.327
I just broke your streak,
I think.

29:34.329 --> 29:37.330
If I were...
Look. There it is again.

29:37.332 --> 29:38.266
Okay.

29:40.935 --> 29:43.169
He's gonna be fine, honey.

29:43.171 --> 29:45.073
Sorry. Nervous habit.

29:46.907 --> 29:49.007
Your daddy know
about Zach?

29:49.009 --> 29:51.644
We haven't really
talked that much.

29:51.646 --> 29:55.148
Your father's a mess,
but he still is your father.

29:55.150 --> 29:58.351
He's never really
even tried to apologize.

29:58.353 --> 30:02.357
Well, maybe he doesn't know how.
Maybe he's too proud, too broken.

30:04.059 --> 30:07.229
Losing your mama
hurt him too.

30:09.665 --> 30:13.335
I'm not saying his behavior is
excusable, but it is forgivable.

30:15.370 --> 30:19.107
You'd be surprised how things can start
to change when you forgive someone.

30:26.014 --> 30:29.249
All right, so the anesthesiologist
will be in in a few minutes. Okay?

30:29.251 --> 30:31.418
Okay.

30:31.420 --> 30:35.857
Listen, do you think, before you
leave, I could get your phone number?

30:38.126 --> 30:41.027
What? I'm not
a football player anymore.

30:41.029 --> 30:42.929
Well, I also
don't date patients.

30:42.931 --> 30:44.698
So there's that.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.235
Now you're just
making stuff up.

30:48.003 --> 30:51.138
What is that on your bracelet there?
Galatians 20:20.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.973
Like your eyesight.

30:52.975 --> 30:54.208
- What is it?
- Galatians 2:20.

30:54.210 --> 30:56.410
Oh. Uh... Um...

30:56.412 --> 30:59.278
"I'm crucified with Christ."
Right?

30:59.280 --> 31:02.218
- Yeah. That's one of my favorites.
- Yeah. It's a great verse.

31:04.018 --> 31:05.952
All right.
You take care.

31:05.954 --> 31:10.457
So, Miss Ginger, are you sure
about that phone number thing?

31:10.459 --> 31:12.159
Because I sure
would like it.

31:12.161 --> 31:14.161
You are relentless.

31:14.163 --> 31:18.031
Listen, I'm sure our paths will
cross again if it's meant to be.

31:18.033 --> 31:20.735
- It was nice seeing you, Zach.
- You too.

31:20.737 --> 31:22.971
Hey, I'm sorry
about your knee.

31:26.242 --> 31:28.075
Okay.

31:28.077 --> 31:32.047
<i>Dr. Randall,
please call the operator.</i>

31:37.487 --> 31:39.289
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

31:40.490 --> 31:42.524
Motion, motion.

31:49.365 --> 31:52.065
That's right
on the line of scrimmage.

31:57.407 --> 32:00.175
- What the heck?
- Somebody's got to follow up. Okay?

32:00.177 --> 32:03.478
Truett. We're getting killed
out there because of you!

32:19.362 --> 32:22.063
What up, Truett?
I was hoping to see you tonight.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.000
Right on the bench
where you belong.

32:30.106 --> 32:32.443
Let's break this up!

32:34.311 --> 32:36.277
- Watch out, Truett.
- Blow it, blow it!

32:36.279 --> 32:37.545
Truett!

32:37.547 --> 32:40.248
<i>Come on, what are you thinkin'?</i>

32:40.250 --> 32:43.218
<i>You're not even in the game,
and you're causing problems!</i>

32:43.220 --> 32:45.520
<i>Get off my bench, son.</i>

33:06.511 --> 33:11.547
I realize you've been doing the job
of two people, and I appreciate that.

33:11.549 --> 33:14.116
- I wanted you to know that.
- Thank you, Nanny.

33:14.118 --> 33:15.486
I love you.

33:19.290 --> 33:21.490
Good night.
You lock up.

33:21.492 --> 33:23.594
I will.
I love you too.

33:37.241 --> 33:38.642
Thank you.

33:38.644 --> 33:40.646
- Good night, Zachary.
- Night, Nanny.

34:05.136 --> 34:06.204
Oh!

34:09.541 --> 34:11.108
Ooh.

34:38.168 --> 34:39.571
Hey, it's midnight!

34:41.273 --> 34:42.373
Dave.

34:44.610 --> 34:46.378
Davey, let's go, man.

34:48.647 --> 34:50.148
Dude.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.688
Davey!

35:02.427 --> 35:03.695
Dave.

35:06.598 --> 35:08.400
Where are you, bud?

35:11.303 --> 35:12.605
Hello?

35:15.408 --> 35:16.643
Dave.

35:17.477 --> 35:19.543
Hey, hey.

35:19.545 --> 35:23.380
Hey, look at me.
You all right? Hey.

35:23.382 --> 35:24.982
You see me? You good?

35:24.984 --> 35:26.282
Yeah.

35:26.284 --> 35:27.319
Here, let me help you up.

35:29.488 --> 35:31.624
Here. Come on.
Let me help you.

35:34.694 --> 35:36.827
- That was a rough one.
- Yeah?

35:36.829 --> 35:38.996
Uh-huh.

35:38.998 --> 35:41.465
I'm sorry, man.
I wish I could have been here.

35:41.467 --> 35:44.368
- I was in the other aisle.
- There's nothing you can do.

35:44.370 --> 35:46.304
Look at me.
Let me see your eyes.

35:47.406 --> 35:49.307
- You good?
- I'm good. I'm good.

37:41.723 --> 37:43.358
Good morning.

37:44.559 --> 37:45.493
Morning, Coach.

37:47.128 --> 37:48.662
What are you
doing here?

37:50.865 --> 37:53.902
Rough night last night for
the both of us, I suppose.

37:55.136 --> 37:56.471
Yeah.

37:59.541 --> 38:02.708
Brought doughnuts. Can you make a
decent pot of coffee, Mr. Truett?

38:02.710 --> 38:04.379
Yes, sir. Uh...

38:05.680 --> 38:07.715
Actually, our coffee pot's
broken, I think.

38:09.751 --> 38:11.786
Sorry.

38:18.726 --> 38:21.396
You boys doing okay?
You all right?

38:25.500 --> 38:26.934
Yeah.
I've been better.

38:26.936 --> 38:28.969
Well,

38:28.971 --> 38:32.773
I personally know a handful
of amazing athletes

38:32.775 --> 38:36.744
who have come back strong
from ACL surgery, son.

38:38.546 --> 38:40.746
- How many of them lost scholarships?
- There's more to life...

38:40.748 --> 38:43.816
It's not just about football,
with all due respect, sir.

38:43.818 --> 38:45.786
It's about a ticket
out of here.

38:45.788 --> 38:47.488
And that ticket's
gone now...

38:48.591 --> 38:49.892
because of me.

38:51.460 --> 38:53.963
You know, son,
I'm really, terribly sorry.

38:55.898 --> 38:59.765
But these things that life

38:59.767 --> 39:02.437
has landed on you boys
the way that it has...

39:07.877 --> 39:09.745
I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

39:13.515 --> 39:16.450
Track season's right around the corner.
Track season.

39:16.452 --> 39:19.553
You know, they give
scholarships for track.

39:19.555 --> 39:22.655
I guess your knee won't
be ready for that either.

39:22.657 --> 39:25.659
- Wouldn't matter if it was.
- What?

39:25.661 --> 39:27.628
- Said it wouldn't matter if it was.
- Why?

39:27.630 --> 39:29.663
Because I don't run track.
I play football.

39:29.665 --> 39:31.932
That's right.

39:31.934 --> 39:34.868
You're a football player, son.

39:34.870 --> 39:37.471
One of the finest football
players I've ever seen in my life

39:37.473 --> 39:38.975
and don't you
ever forget it.

39:41.477 --> 39:45.679
Oh, God, man.
I'm ashamed.

39:45.681 --> 39:49.082
I really wish I could
do something for you, son.

39:49.084 --> 39:51.687
I really do.

40:09.772 --> 40:11.473
Ladybird.

40:14.010 --> 40:16.510
This one seems so cool.

40:16.512 --> 40:20.682
Hey, hey. You guys go ahead.
Meet you in a sec.

40:20.684 --> 40:21.918
All right, weirdo.

40:27.791 --> 40:33.128
Well, now, I'd say this baby right here
goes from zero to 60 in 3.5 seconds.

40:33.130 --> 40:36.596
- Did you guys know that?
- See you later.

40:36.598 --> 40:38.835
Did they not know that?
Oh, they knew it.

40:39.736 --> 40:41.669
'70 Mustang?

40:41.671 --> 40:44.874
Has a V8, 350 horses
under the hood.

40:46.676 --> 40:49.610
Not a chance.

40:49.612 --> 40:52.047
Uh-oh. You actually know a thing
or two about cars, don't you?

40:52.049 --> 40:55.617
- Uh-oh. You don't, do you?
- No, not even a little bit.

40:55.619 --> 40:58.920
- Not one bit.
- Yikes. You caught me. You caught me.

40:58.922 --> 41:01.323
How's your knee feeling, sir?

41:01.325 --> 41:05.626
Well, ma'am, my knee is feeling fantastic.
It's getting there, thanks to you.

41:05.628 --> 41:06.828
- Good.
- Speaking of which,

41:06.830 --> 41:11.100
I distinctly remember a
conversation with my nurse intern

41:11.102 --> 41:15.838
regarding paths crossing again
or fate or something like that.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.940
- I don't think I used the word "fate."
- Hmm.

41:17.942 --> 41:19.842
- Well...
- I remember a similar conversation.

41:19.844 --> 41:23.845
- I did not use the word fate.
- Well, we can agree to disagree.

41:23.847 --> 41:26.915
Regardless, is this the part
where I get your number or...

41:26.917 --> 41:28.683
Subtle. Nice.

41:28.685 --> 41:31.653
Well, I do what I can.
Why beat around the bush? You know?

41:31.655 --> 41:34.658
I was thinking Friday
at 8:00 p.m., of course.

41:35.926 --> 41:37.893
I could pick you up.

41:37.895 --> 41:40.963
How about if I meet you somewhere
for coffee tomorrow afternoon?

41:40.965 --> 41:42.965
- Coffee.
- How's that sound?

41:42.967 --> 41:46.368
If you're into coffee, I got a great place,
but they're only open Friday at 8:00.

41:48.739 --> 41:49.805
All right.

41:49.807 --> 41:53.809
Yeah? Wow.

41:53.811 --> 41:56.011
- Don't be weird about it.
- Okay, sorry.

41:56.013 --> 41:58.115
Are you gonna wear those pigtails to dinner?

41:59.050 --> 42:01.184
How's the rehab going?

42:01.186 --> 42:03.619
- Nonexistent.
- Fine.

42:03.621 --> 42:06.688
Are you doing your exercises?
Using the bands?

42:06.690 --> 42:07.957
- Yes, I am.
- Nope.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.659
Dave, come on, man, seriously.
She's asking me these questions.

42:10.661 --> 42:13.128
Zach. Look, you need
to be keeping up with this.

42:13.130 --> 42:16.865
That scar tissue is going to
build up and be very problematic.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.835
You need to do the routine
every day to get this right.

42:19.837 --> 42:21.940
- Okay, I get it.
- No, I don't think you do.

42:31.850 --> 42:34.250
I actually forgot my phone
inside, so just go to the car.

42:34.252 --> 42:36.921
All right. Here, give me the keys.
Dude, really?

42:38.722 --> 42:40.092
You played quarterback?

42:40.892 --> 42:41.793
Excuse me.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.895
What if I wanted to try
to play some sports?

42:45.897 --> 42:48.198
- You know football is out of the question.
- Right.

42:48.200 --> 42:52.035
But what if I wanted to run track...
competitively?

42:52.037 --> 42:54.871
Like you have always said,
it's about not taking a hit,

42:54.873 --> 42:58.908
and that my brain abnormalities
are reduced with exercise.

42:58.910 --> 43:02.812
We're not talking about just jogging
around the park, Dave, and you know that.

43:02.814 --> 43:05.081
But technically,
you could clear me?

43:05.083 --> 43:09.886
I mean, taking your medication
every time before you run

43:09.888 --> 43:11.823
is an absolute must.

43:14.093 --> 43:16.227
So, I got cleared
to run track.

43:16.229 --> 43:18.129
What?

43:18.131 --> 43:20.898
Yeah. I ran back in and asked the doctor.
She says I'm all good.

43:20.900 --> 43:23.733
She says
it's safe for you?

43:23.735 --> 43:25.768
Yeah. She cleared me,
didn't she?

43:25.770 --> 43:30.307
Yeah. I guess. That's awesome, man.
That's gonna be cool.

43:30.309 --> 43:33.177
I was thinking I could get
one of those scholarships

43:33.179 --> 43:35.778
like Coach
was talking about.

43:35.780 --> 43:40.484
Dave, you've never ran track in your
life, and you want to get a scholarship?

43:40.486 --> 43:42.052
You really think
you could do that?

43:42.054 --> 43:43.488
Who's the fastest guy
at Bessemer?

43:43.490 --> 43:44.989
I'm the fastest guy
at Bessemer.

43:44.991 --> 43:48.758
Okay, look,
I run with you step for step.

43:48.760 --> 43:51.728
I even beat you
half the time, maybe more.

43:51.730 --> 43:53.964
No, definitely less.

43:53.966 --> 43:56.200
Dude, I'm fast.

43:56.202 --> 43:59.103
Yeah, you are.
You're fast, man.

43:59.105 --> 44:02.041
Look, I can do this.

44:03.976 --> 44:06.844
I've got nothing to lose
and a scholarship to gain.

44:06.846 --> 44:10.047
It's not gonna be easy. You're
gonna really have to bust your butt.

44:10.049 --> 44:12.316
Just one thing.
I'm going to need a training partner.

44:12.318 --> 44:14.854
That's not a problem.
We can find you a training partner.

44:16.289 --> 44:18.157
What are you smiling
like that for?

44:19.892 --> 44:23.328
Okay, I see where you're
going with this.

44:23.330 --> 44:26.331
We've trained together for every sport,
from peewee baseball to varsity football.

44:26.333 --> 44:29.100
I get it, I get it,
I get it.

44:29.102 --> 44:31.970
I don't know, man.
I'm not a trainer.

44:31.972 --> 44:36.240
Come on. You got nothing to lose.
You in?

44:45.385 --> 44:48.320
- This is actually really good coffee.
- Is it?

44:48.322 --> 44:51.823
Let me taste it.
I've never actually had it. You mind?

44:51.825 --> 44:54.125
- All right.
- Okay. It's so sweet.

44:54.127 --> 44:56.261
- You told me it was really good.
- I know.

44:56.263 --> 44:58.064
That's what I heard
through the grapevine.

45:01.368 --> 45:02.866
- Mmm.
- That's good.

45:02.868 --> 45:06.137
That's pretty terrible.

45:06.139 --> 45:09.276
So, what do you do all day now
that you don't play football?

45:10.277 --> 45:12.177
What do I do all day?

45:12.179 --> 45:16.114
Mainly bird watching. I've gotten
into bird watching pretty heavily.

45:16.116 --> 45:18.817
I also enjoy coloring.

45:18.819 --> 45:23.288
I am... I'm about 72 pages into
my most recent coloring book.

45:23.290 --> 45:27.259
I got it three days ago so I've really
been, you know, pounding that out.

45:27.261 --> 45:32.330
I obsess over this really pretty
nurse that I met recently, you know?

45:32.332 --> 45:35.834
She's got something
I can't quite put my finger on.

45:35.836 --> 45:38.437
I mean, Martha's everything
I've always wanted.

45:38.439 --> 45:41.207
Martha!

45:41.209 --> 45:43.909
I don't know why you're laughing.
It's not funny. It's why I'm here.

45:43.911 --> 45:46.077
- Martha.
- To get closer to you, to get closer to her.

45:46.079 --> 45:48.446
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

45:48.448 --> 45:50.115
Well, she's a lucky lady.

45:50.117 --> 45:52.919
No, I'm the lucky lady
to be here sitting with you.

45:55.623 --> 45:58.190
I think I like you
or something.

45:58.192 --> 46:00.860
- I'm pretty excited to be here.
- Yeah?

46:00.862 --> 46:03.062
- Yeah. I'm glad I said yes.
- Me too.

46:03.064 --> 46:05.064
I'm starving though.

46:05.066 --> 46:07.066
- Yeah, me too. I haven't eaten all day.
- You ready to do this?

46:07.068 --> 46:09.269
I'm so ready,
it's not even funny.

46:10.137 --> 46:11.306
Should...

46:14.975 --> 46:16.409
Sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt.

46:16.411 --> 46:18.477
No, I thought
we could pray first.

46:18.479 --> 46:21.013
- You want to do it, like, together?
- Yeah.

46:21.015 --> 46:23.217
Okay, cool.
Finish, like, chewing stuff.

46:26.154 --> 46:27.955
All right.

46:30.024 --> 46:33.326
You wanna take it away?

46:33.328 --> 46:36.962
No. You really... I'm good.
You don't have to walk me to my car.

46:36.964 --> 46:41.300
If it's what I gotta do to spend a few
extra minutes with you, I'm all for it.

46:41.302 --> 46:43.235
- You're very chivalrous.
- Yeah, well...

46:43.237 --> 46:45.037
Noted.

46:45.039 --> 46:47.106
Good. I'm just trying to score
some points here, you know?

46:47.108 --> 46:49.409
You got one point with that.
You're on the board.

46:49.411 --> 46:53.513
All right. Good, good. Besides, what
if there was someone who came up and...

46:53.515 --> 46:57.283
Like that guy who came and like tried
to mug you, or these people right here?

46:57.285 --> 47:00.119
- I don't know what I would do.
- I know what I would do.

47:00.121 --> 47:03.523
- What would you do?
- I'd protect you with ancient kung fu.

47:03.525 --> 47:07.227
Ancient kung fu. Whoa!
That was my impressed face.

47:07.229 --> 47:10.163
- Was it? Were you impressed?
- Let me see it?

47:10.165 --> 47:12.000
You're impressed with that.
Check this out.

47:13.202 --> 47:15.068
- Come at me.
- Wow.

47:15.070 --> 47:16.338
That's what I thought.

48:09.324 --> 48:12.392
Dad?

48:12.394 --> 48:14.562
Oh.

48:14.564 --> 48:17.199
Wow.
Beer and roses.

48:18.501 --> 48:20.203
That's a nice touch.

48:28.578 --> 48:30.980
I had 20 Christmases
with her.

48:31.582 --> 48:33.148
Two without her is...

48:36.619 --> 48:38.521
Two Christmases
without her.

48:41.124 --> 48:44.994
It's always hardest in the
holidays, and I know that I...

48:48.097 --> 48:53.036
I know that I just make everything
worse, and, um...

48:54.103 --> 48:55.306
It's okay, Dad.

48:57.407 --> 48:58.806
I forgive you.

48:58.808 --> 49:01.509
Two Christmases
without <i>her?</i>

49:01.511 --> 49:05.079
How 'bout two Christmases
without us? Your sons.

49:05.081 --> 49:06.581
- We still could have been a family!
- We are a family...

49:06.583 --> 49:08.316
- We're not a family.
- Come on, Zach.

49:08.318 --> 49:09.751
- Why you always sticking up for him?
- Because he's our dad!

49:09.753 --> 49:14.123
No, he is not our dad! He's a drunk
and a coward. And he is not my father!

49:24.367 --> 49:26.300
Why don't you have a minute
with your mother?

49:26.302 --> 49:27.636
You don't have to go, Dad.

49:27.638 --> 49:31.340
You're a good boy, Dave.
Merry Christmas.

49:31.342 --> 49:32.576
Merry Christmas.

50:12.182 --> 50:16.186
What kind of man walks out on his two
boys after their mom dies of cancer?

50:19.590 --> 50:21.325
A broken one.

50:24.194 --> 50:25.564
And that's a good enough
answer for you?

50:45.684 --> 50:48.217
Man, that thing's
been here since we were kids.

50:48.219 --> 50:50.353
Did they ever figure out
who broke off baby Jesus' leg?

50:50.355 --> 50:52.221
Wasn't that you?

50:52.223 --> 50:55.460
Yeah, I know, but I'm just wondering
if they ever figured that out.

51:07.505 --> 51:09.441
You all right?

51:12.243 --> 51:14.680
Yeah. It's just bringing back
old memories or whatever.

51:17.282 --> 51:19.550
<i>We all could use a moment.</i>

51:19.552 --> 51:23.386
I'm not just talking about
being in the moment,

51:23.388 --> 51:26.389
but one of life's
beautiful moments.

51:26.391 --> 51:30.560
I'm talking about a
game-changing, seismic shift,

51:30.562 --> 51:32.730
capital-"M" moment.

51:32.732 --> 51:34.965
- Amen.
- You know what I mean?

51:34.967 --> 51:39.536
Where after that,
everything in your life seems different.

51:39.538 --> 51:43.407
We're here to celebrate
a moment like that this evening.

51:43.409 --> 51:46.209
- I know you know what I'm talking about.
- Amen.

51:46.211 --> 51:48.511
Yeah, I'm talking about
the birth of Jesus.

51:48.513 --> 51:50.750
A moment with a capital "M."

51:52.283 --> 51:55.552
After that moment,
history would change.

51:55.554 --> 51:58.522
That's right.
Praise the Lord.

51:58.524 --> 52:01.558
But most of us, we don't
get to have our moment.

52:01.560 --> 52:06.463
Because we suffer from an
affliction called "The Somedays."

52:06.465 --> 52:08.632
<i>And it goes something like this</i>

52:08.634 --> 52:13.171
Someday, I'm really gonna
listen more and not just talk.

52:14.373 --> 52:16.742
<i>Someday,
I'm gonna pour into my kids.</i>

52:18.844 --> 52:22.648
Someday, I'm gonna get right
with all that God stuff.

52:24.450 --> 52:26.753
I'm gonna get
spiritually aligned.

52:27.854 --> 52:32.457
God's gift to us...
was Jesus.

52:32.459 --> 52:34.291
Thank you, Lord.

52:34.293 --> 52:39.765
So that one day, our someday
could become our moment.

52:46.539 --> 52:49.574
Davey, we've gotta
get out of here, man.

52:49.576 --> 52:51.712
I am so sick of Bessemer.

52:53.647 --> 52:59.616
I don't want to get stuck
here, you know? End up like Dad.

52:59.618 --> 53:02.453
I'd rather us be running to
something instead of from something.

53:02.455 --> 53:03.724
It doesn't matter.

53:04.858 --> 53:06.593
It's just time to run.

56:05.041 --> 56:07.541
So can I leave my car
parked here,

56:07.543 --> 56:10.477
or do I need to wait for
the valet to come through?

56:10.479 --> 56:11.878
- Shut up.
- Yeah, you're right.

56:11.880 --> 56:14.648
I should probably keep the keys on me.
Looks like a rough neighborhood.

56:14.650 --> 56:16.683
Hi. So glad
you could make it.

56:16.685 --> 56:19.686
Yeah, I'm glad I got the invite
to finally meet the fam.

56:19.688 --> 56:21.088
Sorry. My breath
smells like coffee.

56:21.090 --> 56:23.658
So, when you meet my dad...

56:23.660 --> 56:25.559
- Yeah?
- ...don't worry.

56:25.561 --> 56:28.996
He can come off a little intimidating,
but he's really a total softy.

56:28.998 --> 56:31.901
- He'll just hit you with some small talk.
- I can do small talk.

56:33.502 --> 56:35.102
Tell me what you like
about my daughter, Zach.

56:35.104 --> 56:36.438
Dad.

56:38.908 --> 56:41.075
Just getting right to it.
No, I love it.

56:41.077 --> 56:44.578
That's cool. That's a good question.
It's an easy one to answer.

56:44.580 --> 56:48.683
I think she's pretty great
to be around.

56:48.685 --> 56:51.519
You know, I like
spending time with her.

56:51.521 --> 56:54.122
She's obviously
very beautiful.

56:54.124 --> 56:59.660
I see the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree, ma'am.

56:59.662 --> 57:02.830
- Well... thank you, Zach.
- You're very welcome.

57:02.832 --> 57:04.867
Don't make eyes
at my wife, son.

57:08.871 --> 57:10.740
Um...

57:12.675 --> 57:15.676
I was just making a joke.

57:15.678 --> 57:17.513
- So was I.
- Okay.

57:18.816 --> 57:20.648
Sorry.

57:20.650 --> 57:22.518
And what do you think
about Jesus?

57:26.022 --> 57:29.724
Um, this small talk...

57:29.726 --> 57:33.661
It's important to us to know
who's dating our daughter.

57:33.663 --> 57:36.633
Yeah. Of course.
No, I get that. Um...

57:39.036 --> 57:41.570
I'm just...

57:41.572 --> 57:46.774
I'm just a little afraid, I guess,
that if I tell you guys how I feel,

57:46.776 --> 57:49.113
you might not let me
see Ginger again.

57:51.081 --> 57:55.052
Well, at least you're honest,
so we're off to a good start.

57:58.155 --> 57:59.890
Okay. Well...

58:02.793 --> 58:08.097
I don't know where to begin.
I guess I know a lot about Jesus.

58:08.099 --> 58:13.368
But I'm not sure I really know him the
way my mother did and my brother does

58:13.370 --> 58:15.937
and maybe the way
you guys do.

58:15.939 --> 58:18.807
I grew up in church
and everything...

58:18.809 --> 58:23.079
but as I got older, I started asking
all these, you know, questions,

58:23.081 --> 58:26.817
and now there's just a lot
of things I'm unsure about.

58:27.785 --> 58:28.820
Like what?

58:30.188 --> 58:31.122
Well...

58:33.157 --> 58:35.791
if you really want to know,

58:35.793 --> 58:42.098
I don't understand why Jesus would
leave towns before everybody was healed.

58:42.100 --> 58:45.968
I don't understand why all of Jesus'
disciples died these terrible deaths.

58:45.970 --> 58:50.840
I mean, Peter was crucified upside down,
and he was one of Jesus' best friends.

58:50.842 --> 58:52.710
So that doesn't
really add up for me.

58:53.711 --> 58:56.645
I guess I just...

58:56.647 --> 59:00.183
I don't understand why terrible
people get to live to be a hundred

59:00.185 --> 59:04.721
and amazing people like my
mother were taken away too early.

59:10.862 --> 59:13.729
By the way,

59:13.731 --> 59:18.000
I get that I'm totally blowing this
whole meet-the-parents-for-dinner thing.

59:18.002 --> 59:19.036
Not at all.

59:19.038 --> 59:20.072
I'm sorry.

59:21.005 --> 59:23.072
No.

59:23.074 --> 59:27.812
You're not the first person sitting at
this table to wrestle with his faith.

59:30.782 --> 59:32.183
Trust me.

59:33.785 --> 59:34.752
Yes, sir.

59:39.058 --> 59:40.625
- Can we eat?
- Yes, please.

59:41.260 --> 59:42.194
Let's eat.

59:44.896 --> 59:46.898
<i>Hey. What's wrong?</i>

59:49.033 --> 59:51.901
Zach, I really like you.

59:51.903 --> 59:56.006
I guess I didn't realize
how you felt.

59:56.008 --> 59:59.011
What, about God?
I thought that was between me and him.

01:00:00.913 --> 01:00:03.782
Yeah, but it's important to
me, and you know that.

01:00:06.919 --> 01:00:10.920
I get it, all right? I do.

01:00:10.922 --> 01:00:14.692
I get the whole Jesus thing.
And I did it for a long time.

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:19.796
But things happen,
and people change.

01:00:19.798 --> 01:00:21.899
God doesn't change.

01:00:21.901 --> 01:00:24.201
Zach, he loves you,
whether you want him to or not.

01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:28.906
I can't just snap my fingers
and make everything okay.

01:00:28.908 --> 01:00:32.909
But then again, I don't have a huge house
and nice things and perfect parents.

01:00:32.911 --> 01:00:35.145
You just trust him.

01:00:35.147 --> 01:00:37.080
He's gonna meet you
wherever you're at.

01:00:37.082 --> 01:00:39.016
Really?

01:00:39.018 --> 01:00:40.951
It's that simple?

01:00:40.953 --> 01:00:43.987
Man, I've just had the switch
turned to off the whole time.

01:00:43.989 --> 01:00:48.126
The one that says, "trust God." I'm
an idiot. I should just turn it on.

01:00:48.128 --> 01:00:50.228
Then I can be good enough
for your little club.

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:53.064
You know that that's not
what I'm saying, Zach.

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:54.834
It sure sounds like it.

01:01:03.075 --> 01:01:05.178
You look cold.
You should probably go inside.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:11.851
Yeah.

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:15.855
Okay.

01:01:17.891 --> 01:01:19.857
Thanks for coming
tonight, Zach.

01:01:57.831 --> 01:01:59.063
Hey.

01:01:59.065 --> 01:02:02.103
Mike, is this your boy?

01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:06.474
- What are you talking about?
- Right here.

01:02:10.844 --> 01:02:14.145
Yeah. Yeah, that's my boy.
Looks like he's running track now.

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:17.982
Track?
It's a football town, man.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:21.886
He'll be running around like Ms. Pacman.

01:02:21.888 --> 01:02:23.922
He mentioned thanking
some people in here too.

01:02:23.924 --> 01:02:25.324
But not you.

01:02:25.326 --> 01:02:30.296
Well, you know what?
Donald, maybe he forgot.

01:02:30.298 --> 01:02:34.032
He's a teenager,
and kids forget.

01:02:34.034 --> 01:02:38.372
They ain't got no respect these days.
That's what I think.

01:02:41.142 --> 01:02:44.977
Your boy, he's running his butt off, man.
He's good.

01:02:44.979 --> 01:02:48.147
You know, he takes first place
tomorrow, he's going to State?

01:02:48.149 --> 01:02:51.016
I guess he figures he's gotta
make up for his brother,

01:02:51.018 --> 01:02:53.052
who ruined
your football season.

01:02:53.054 --> 01:02:55.355
You know, it's the least he can
do, right, Coach?

01:02:55.357 --> 01:02:57.156
Ruined it
for the whole town.

01:02:57.158 --> 01:03:00.092
These boys, they've been
dealt a tough hand, D.

01:03:00.094 --> 01:03:03.095
- They been through a lot.
- Hey. We've all been through a lot, Bill.

01:03:03.097 --> 01:03:05.064
Yeah, but your boys
are different.

01:03:05.066 --> 01:03:07.166
They're amazing. They're resilient.
They're special.

01:03:07.168 --> 01:03:10.305
I don't need your help
with my kids, Bill.

01:03:11.673 --> 01:03:13.241
Yeah, you do.

01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:19.245
Your boys don't need a coach.
They need a dad, Mike.

01:03:19.247 --> 01:03:21.947
The whole world's going crazy,
spinning out of control,

01:03:21.949 --> 01:03:24.983
and somehow your boys have
managed so far to make it.

01:03:24.985 --> 01:03:29.255
You're gonna look up one day,
and they will have moved on.

01:03:29.257 --> 01:03:31.391
To Gainesville,
Jacksonville, maybe.

01:03:31.393 --> 01:03:35.128
Somewhere, but not here.
Not Bessemer.

01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:39.468
And you're gonna miss 'em, Mike.
And that game will be over, Dad.

01:03:56.118 --> 01:03:58.286
Gary.

01:04:00.956 --> 01:04:02.391
Want another one, Mike?

01:04:03.325 --> 01:04:05.894
I'm good. Good.

01:04:07.463 --> 01:04:09.164
See you tomorrow, Mike.

01:04:20.543 --> 01:04:24.578
<i>God, just asking you,
watch over me and keep me safe out there,</i>

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:29.250
<i>and help me perform to the best of my
abilities in a way that honors you.</i>

01:04:29.252 --> 01:04:35.054
Whatever is part of your plan,
I trust that you've got my back.

01:04:35.056 --> 01:04:36.189
Dave.

01:04:36.191 --> 01:04:39.092
- Amen.
- Dave. What are you doing, man?

01:04:39.094 --> 01:04:42.128
- Everyone's out there warming up.
- Just a pregame routine.

01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:45.599
Is he gonna stretch for you too?
Let's get out there, man.

01:04:45.601 --> 01:04:47.301
- All right.
- Let's go!

01:04:47.303 --> 01:04:49.203
- I'll be out there in a minute.
- All right.

01:04:49.205 --> 01:04:54.442
<i>Welcome back, Rebel fans, to
the 3A Area track and field championships.</i>

01:04:54.444 --> 01:04:57.210
<i>Getting ready to start
is the Boys' 400 Meter</i>

01:04:57.212 --> 01:04:59.613
<i>where former Bessemer
quarterback David Truett</i>

01:04:59.615 --> 01:05:02.416
<i>has fought his way back
from a career-ending head injur</i>

01:05:02.418 --> 01:05:05.419
<i>to challenge as the dark horse
in this new arena.</i>

01:05:05.421 --> 01:05:07.188
- Hey, good to see you, Coach.
- Good to see you.

01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:09.390
- Good to see you, Coach.
- Good to see you, now.

01:05:09.392 --> 01:05:11.027
- All right. Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

01:05:15.231 --> 01:05:18.100
Hey, Truett. What size is that shirt, man?
Extra small?

01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:21.337
You got this, all right?

01:05:22.104 --> 01:05:23.372
You got this.

01:05:25.074 --> 01:05:27.241
<i>Truett will
be running in lane five,</i>

01:05:27.243 --> 01:05:31.111
<i>and right next to last year's area
champ, Justin Nole, in lane four.</i>

01:05:31.113 --> 01:05:32.783
Runners, on your mark.

01:05:36.653 --> 01:05:37.987
Set!

01:05:43.494 --> 01:05:44.994
Come on, Dave!

01:05:46.262 --> 01:05:49.396
There you go, bud.
Keep it up! Keep it up!

01:05:49.398 --> 01:05:53.502
<i>Don't blink. Just one lap,
folks. Nole is out to a quick lead.</i>

01:05:53.504 --> 01:05:56.538
Oh, my Lord.
My heart can't take this.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:00.375
<i>There's not much separation as they come
out of turn two down the backstretch.</i>

01:06:00.377 --> 01:06:02.511
<i>They're neck and neck.
It's Nole in the lead.</i>

01:06:02.513 --> 01:06:04.147
Come on, man. You got this.

01:06:07.184 --> 01:06:11.020
- <i>Truett pulls into third as we round out of the last turn.</i>
- Yes!

01:06:11.855 --> 01:06:13.688
- Come on, Truett!
- Dave, move!

01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:15.357
- <i>Here they come down the front stretch.</i>
- Come on, boy.

01:06:15.359 --> 01:06:17.125
Come on! Come on!

01:06:17.127 --> 01:06:20.328
- Go, go, go!
- Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:22.599
Kick that into gear, Dave!

01:06:24.669 --> 01:06:28.604
<i>And it's too close to call!
What a finish!</i>

01:06:28.606 --> 01:06:32.174
<i>We're gonna have to wait from
confirmation from the judges.</i>

01:06:35.379 --> 01:06:38.181
- <i>And Truett wins it with a 49!</i>
- Yeah!

01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:41.884
<i>He's your new 3A area...</i>
Yes.

01:06:41.886 --> 01:06:43.719
<i>...track and field champion.</i>

01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:48.123
Thank you, Coach.

01:06:48.125 --> 01:06:51.663
- Congratulations, son.
- Are you kidding me?

01:06:54.198 --> 01:06:56.665
- Faith is a beautiful thing, isn't it?
- Amen.

01:06:56.667 --> 01:06:59.668
- Isn't it a beautiful thing?
- It is.

01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:03.506
If you don't believe and have
faith in your football coach,

01:07:03.508 --> 01:07:05.340
you're not gonna listen
to him, are you?

01:07:05.342 --> 01:07:06.542
No.

01:07:06.544 --> 01:07:08.744
You don't have faith in him.

01:07:08.746 --> 01:07:13.349
But if he tells you to get out and
put in the work, and do the exercises,

01:07:13.351 --> 01:07:14.717
and you don't
put in that work,

01:07:14.719 --> 01:07:17.155
you're not gonna win
a lot of games, are you?

01:07:18.189 --> 01:07:19.455
No.

01:07:19.457 --> 01:07:22.190
- Faith is beautiful.
- Yes, it is.

01:07:22.192 --> 01:07:26.629
Faith with action. That's our homework.
That's all of our homework, isn't it?

01:07:26.631 --> 01:07:30.232
Take that faith in your heart.
Put it into action.

01:07:30.234 --> 01:07:31.767
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen!

01:07:31.769 --> 01:07:32.704
Yes.

01:07:34.439 --> 01:07:36.740
- Thank you, sir.
- Great sermon.

01:07:36.742 --> 01:07:38.575
Thank you.

01:07:38.577 --> 01:07:40.376
Nice.

01:07:40.378 --> 01:07:41.480
See you later.

01:07:46.317 --> 01:07:48.152
It's good
to see you here, Pop.

01:07:49.587 --> 01:07:51.387
Yeah.

01:07:51.389 --> 01:07:55.259
I'm thinking about
making some changes.

01:07:58.631 --> 01:08:02.267
Plus, I don't have anything
better to do on Sunday, so...

01:08:11.476 --> 01:08:13.544
You never told me
how things went with Ginger.

01:08:15.614 --> 01:08:19.416
Well, that's because I haven't
quite figured it out yet.

01:08:19.417 --> 01:08:20.751
You want
to talk about it?

01:08:20.752 --> 01:08:22.287
Nope.

01:08:23.421 --> 01:08:24.821
What'd you do?

01:08:24.823 --> 01:08:27.357
What'd I do?

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.393
Nothing.

01:08:29.395 --> 01:08:31.495
You sabotage your own relationships.
You know that.

01:08:31.497 --> 01:08:32.765
Oh, no, I don't.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.767
Look,

01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:40.504
you just don't want to wait
too long and lose her, man.

01:08:40.506 --> 01:08:43.575
Maybe I do. I'll admit, man, I guess I
have some things I can work on, but...

01:08:44.475 --> 01:08:45.676
we all do.

01:08:45.678 --> 01:08:47.712
Well, you have
a little more than others.

01:08:53.453 --> 01:08:57.854
If I let her go,
I'm an idiot, aren't I?

01:08:57.856 --> 01:09:00.323
I'm gonna assume that's
a rhetorical question?

01:09:00.325 --> 01:09:03.727
Shut up. Come on, let's go.
One last race before State this weekend.

01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:05.761
- Loser does the dishes.
- All right.

01:09:05.764 --> 01:09:08.466
And for clarification,
yes, you are an idiot.

01:09:56.783 --> 01:09:58.716
Ah!

01:09:58.718 --> 01:10:00.585
- Come on!
- Dishes.

01:10:00.587 --> 01:10:02.388
- No.
- All you, baby.

01:10:07.661 --> 01:10:09.429
You're still doing
the dishes.

01:10:11.765 --> 01:10:15.301
Yeah, and I will let him know to
bring it to Room 143 tomorrow.

01:10:16.636 --> 01:10:17.737
Absolutely.

01:10:20.741 --> 01:10:23.644
Um, you got it.
Thanks.

01:10:28.549 --> 01:10:29.683
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.528
Most guys would say sorry
with flowers.

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:45.931
Yeah, well, I know you're
not superficial like that.

01:10:45.933 --> 01:10:47.434
Well, you got lucky.

01:10:48.502 --> 01:10:50.337
I did get lucky.

01:10:51.705 --> 01:10:53.438
And I blew it.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:56.676
Look, Ginger.
I'm sorry. All right?

01:10:58.545 --> 01:11:00.479
I was such a jerk to you.

01:11:00.481 --> 01:11:01.715
And I know that, and...

01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:06.821
I think I just got defensive
because I was scared.

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.792
I'm just struggling with a lot
of different things right now.

01:11:13.694 --> 01:11:15.864
And it's confusing,
and that's no excuse.

01:11:20.167 --> 01:11:22.703
But I know that I don't want
those things to keep me from you.

01:11:25.773 --> 01:11:28.607
Because you're the best thing
that's happened to me

01:11:28.609 --> 01:11:31.745
in a really,
really long time.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:33.514
Zach.

01:11:34.716 --> 01:11:35.817
I don't know.

01:11:37.853 --> 01:11:41.988
We have a lot that we need to talk about.
You really hurt me.

01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:43.690
I know.

01:11:43.692 --> 01:11:44.825
I'm sorry.

01:11:46.194 --> 01:11:48.629
I just don't want
to lose you.

01:11:50.799 --> 01:11:54.936
So I thought I'd bring you
a peace offering, you know.

01:11:59.641 --> 01:12:00.642
Nice touch.

01:12:05.882 --> 01:12:07.582
Apology accepted.

01:12:10.484 --> 01:12:11.586
Come here.

01:12:16.691 --> 01:12:17.991
Thank you.

01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:24.532
A childlike faith, huh?

01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:27.667
You stacked the cards
against me,

01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:30.539
and then you expect me...

01:12:31.873 --> 01:12:34.009
to just believe in you.

01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:38.680
Well, I'm not a kid anymore.

01:12:40.782 --> 01:12:42.649
- It's not that easy.
- You talking to somebody?

01:12:42.651 --> 01:12:45.487
Uh... No.
I'm just thinking.

01:12:46.722 --> 01:12:48.488
Just thinking.

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:51.759
Where's the chocolate?

01:12:51.761 --> 01:12:53.694
We don't have any.

01:12:53.696 --> 01:12:56.263
How are we gonna have s'mores if
we don't have chocolate, dude?

01:12:56.265 --> 01:12:59.099
I guess we're just gonna
have marshmallows and Dew.

01:12:59.101 --> 01:13:01.567
All right, I can dig it.

01:13:01.569 --> 01:13:04.637
You were moving today.
How's the knee feeling?

01:13:04.639 --> 01:13:06.774
- Good enough to smoke you.
- Yeah.

01:13:08.544 --> 01:13:10.678
No, it's feeling good,
man.

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:13.714
I mean, it's 100%.

01:13:13.716 --> 01:13:15.952
- Then I guess it worked.
- What worked?

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.553
I've been training you
this whole time.

01:13:19.555 --> 01:13:22.823
You said your knee was back to 100%.
You're ready to get back on the field.

01:13:22.825 --> 01:13:26.126
- Back on the field?
- Yeah.

01:13:26.128 --> 01:13:28.595
Dave, the season's over.
How am I gonna do that?

01:13:28.597 --> 01:13:32.300
It doesn't matter.
I'm gonna go to State, and I'm gonna win.

01:13:32.302 --> 01:13:34.768
Who's not gonna give a
scholarship to the State champ?

01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:36.637
You're gonna come with me
wherever I go.

01:13:36.639 --> 01:13:38.539
You're gonna walk
onto the team next year.

01:13:38.541 --> 01:13:41.608
And then, after that,
you can get a scholarship for football.

01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:43.311
But we're gonna
get out of here.

01:13:43.313 --> 01:13:45.614
That's the plan.

01:13:47.616 --> 01:13:50.584
You make
it sound pretty easy.

01:13:50.586 --> 01:13:54.523
Yeah, well...
I believe in the plan.

01:13:55.092 --> 01:13:56.860
And I believe in you.

01:14:09.739 --> 01:14:10.706
Dave?

01:14:11.807 --> 01:14:12.775
Dave.

01:14:16.179 --> 01:14:17.746
Hey. Hey.

01:14:17.748 --> 01:14:20.015
You're good, bud. Easy.

01:14:20.017 --> 01:14:24.554
Easy. Easy. Come on. Come on. You're good. You're good.

01:14:25.922 --> 01:14:28.656
All right.

01:14:28.658 --> 01:14:30.995
I'm gonna call 911, all right, man?
I'm gonna be right back.

01:14:45.742 --> 01:14:46.810
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:14:47.811 --> 01:14:49.912
What'd the doctor say?

01:14:49.914 --> 01:14:53.117
He said I had a series
of four grand mal seizures.

01:14:54.952 --> 01:14:56.651
Thank you.

01:14:56.653 --> 01:14:57.852
Thank you.

01:14:57.854 --> 01:15:01.623
So, what does that mean then?
Are you okay? Is that normal?

01:15:01.625 --> 01:15:03.858
'Cause what I saw
wasn't normal, man.

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:07.029
Your eyes were different than I'd ever
seen 'em before. That was not you.

01:15:07.031 --> 01:15:10.099
I'm in good hands now.

01:15:10.101 --> 01:15:12.036
Thank you
for being there for me.

01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:14.939
Yeah. Of course, man.

01:15:16.707 --> 01:15:18.408
How long are you
gonna be here?

01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:20.409
I don't know yet.

01:15:20.411 --> 01:15:24.980
Okay. Well, I'm gonna be here
as long as you're here.

01:15:24.982 --> 01:15:27.715
So I'm gonna run home,
I'm gonna grab some clothes and stuff.

01:15:27.717 --> 01:15:30.088
I'll be back in about an hour.
Is there anything I can get you?

01:15:31.789 --> 01:15:33.756
There's really only one
thing you can do for me.

01:15:33.758 --> 01:15:35.057
What's that?

01:15:35.059 --> 01:15:36.926
Could you dump
my bedpan?

01:15:36.928 --> 01:15:38.729
It's really full.

01:15:39.997 --> 01:15:41.864
Uh... yeah.

01:15:41.866 --> 01:15:44.068
Yeah, that's...
Where is it? Is it over there?

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:50.906
Are you joking?

01:15:50.908 --> 01:15:52.741
Yeah.

01:15:52.743 --> 01:15:54.178
- That's not very funny.
- I'm sorry.

01:15:55.179 --> 01:15:59.014
Honestly,
just pray for me.

01:15:59.016 --> 01:16:01.019
That's all
I need you to do.

01:16:05.757 --> 01:16:06.892
Yeah, I'll do that.

01:16:21.772 --> 01:16:25.976
It's all a part of his plan, right?
That's what you'd say?

01:16:25.978 --> 01:16:28.211
I can't tell you that I know
what his plan is,

01:16:28.213 --> 01:16:32.081
but I do know that all
things work for good.

01:16:32.083 --> 01:16:34.116
Of course.

01:16:34.118 --> 01:16:37.720
All things work for good 'cause so many
good things have happened in my life.

01:16:37.722 --> 01:16:39.925
Come here. Come.
Sit down here.

01:16:46.499 --> 01:16:50.035
When I was 21, doctors found
tumors on both of my ovaries.

01:16:52.004 --> 01:16:54.804
When I found out
I couldn't have kids,

01:16:54.806 --> 01:16:58.076
I cried for a year
straight, every day.

01:17:00.045 --> 01:17:01.713
Now, your grandmother...

01:17:05.117 --> 01:17:07.951
her and I...

01:17:07.953 --> 01:17:12.822
I never had a sister, but if I did,
it would have been that fine lady.

01:17:12.824 --> 01:17:15.962
- I never knew her.
- Oh, I wish you had.

01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:20.165
She was good and kind.
Strong.

01:17:22.201 --> 01:17:25.771
She could admit when she was wrong,
and she stood up for what was right.

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:32.776
She had a heart for God and she
passed all that down to your mama.

01:17:32.778 --> 01:17:35.081
And your mama
passed it down to you boys.

01:17:36.349 --> 01:17:38.851
Now, I was there when you
and Dave were born.

01:17:40.887 --> 01:17:46.124
And every birthday since,
I didn't miss a one, you know that.

01:17:48.994 --> 01:17:52.129
I've watched you boys
grow up to be men.

01:17:52.131 --> 01:17:56.102
Seen more of your life than your
grandma and your mama ever could.

01:17:57.136 --> 01:17:58.905
And I don't know why
that is...

01:18:00.139 --> 01:18:02.875
but I'm eternally grateful.

01:18:03.577 --> 01:18:04.877
You see...

01:18:06.247 --> 01:18:10.047
I was that girl, at 21,

01:18:10.049 --> 01:18:13.119
who thought that God
had forgotten about her.

01:18:14.587 --> 01:18:17.023
But now, the woman at 65...

01:18:18.258 --> 01:18:21.127
sees what God's plan was
all along.

01:18:23.163 --> 01:18:25.264
And I was supposed to be
y'all's Nanny.

01:18:25.266 --> 01:18:29.903
And I wouldn't trade that for
anything in the whole wide world.

01:18:32.972 --> 01:18:37.041
Now, I know life
can be confusing.

01:18:37.043 --> 01:18:38.976
It's full of ups
and downs.

01:18:38.978 --> 01:18:41.047
It doesn't mean God
isn't real

01:18:42.081 --> 01:18:43.916
or that he doesn't love you.

01:18:45.885 --> 01:18:48.122
Because God does love you.

01:18:50.057 --> 01:18:51.959
He loves you like crazy.

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.168
I couldn't have asked
for a better Nanny.

01:19:04.338 --> 01:19:08.075
Come here. I love you boys
like you were my own.

01:19:09.009 --> 01:19:10.144
I love you too.

01:19:13.347 --> 01:19:14.848
Go.

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:24.979
Why is this so hard?

01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:32.455
Every time I come and pray to
you, it's so hard.

01:21:34.457 --> 01:21:36.624
I did it for my mama.
You didn't help me then.

01:21:36.626 --> 01:21:39.094
And I don't understand that.
I never will.

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:42.164
I'm begging
that you'll hear me now.

01:21:43.199 --> 01:21:44.433
'Cause I'm done running.

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:47.436
I'm done running.

01:21:49.038 --> 01:21:52.041
If you want me,
I'm right here.

01:21:59.616 --> 01:22:01.251
I need you.

01:22:06.156 --> 01:22:07.256
Just help me.

01:22:08.224 --> 01:22:09.458
Just help me.

01:22:12.562 --> 01:22:14.063
I'm right here.

01:22:40.323 --> 01:22:43.091
Michael,
what are you doing here?

01:22:43.093 --> 01:22:45.159
- Your Nanny...
- Who called you?

01:22:45.161 --> 01:22:46.363
Nanny called me.

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:53.301
All right. I've got this under
control, so can you please leave?

01:22:53.303 --> 01:22:54.503
Hey, Zachary.

01:22:54.505 --> 01:22:56.304
Can you just leave, Dad?

01:22:56.306 --> 01:22:58.608
Just listen to me
for a second.

01:23:03.113 --> 01:23:05.081
I've made a lot of mistakes
in my life.

01:23:08.184 --> 01:23:09.419
A lot of mistakes.

01:23:13.591 --> 01:23:17.094
But the biggest mistake that I ever made
was walking out on you and your brother.

01:23:19.396 --> 01:23:22.632
And I'd like to make that up
to you if you'll let me try.

01:23:23.633 --> 01:23:25.335
I love you so much.

01:23:26.604 --> 01:23:28.204
And I'm sorry.

01:23:30.206 --> 01:23:31.342
I'm sorry.

01:23:35.146 --> 01:23:39.684
You don't have to forgive me, Zachary.
You don't have to forgive me.

01:24:04.576 --> 01:24:07.710
<i>Hoping to have a better
spring game performanc than a season ago.</i>

01:24:07.712 --> 01:24:09.078
<i>We are gonna have a kickoff.</i>

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:13.282
<i>Even though all special teams
tonight will be no contact,</i>

01:24:13.284 --> 01:24:15.718
<i>the pure simulation...</i>

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:16.953
Hey, bud.

01:24:16.955 --> 01:24:19.455
Hey.
Is Dad still here?

01:24:19.457 --> 01:24:22.191
- No, he's not. He'll be back though.
- Oh.

01:24:22.193 --> 01:24:24.461
Here, check this out.

01:24:24.463 --> 01:24:26.763
Look what I got for you, man.
I thought you might want it.

01:24:26.765 --> 01:24:28.531
Thanks.

01:24:28.533 --> 01:24:31.402
Hey, listen, man.
You know how you asked me to pray for you?

01:24:33.738 --> 01:24:34.538
I did it.

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:39.375
- That's awesome, Zach.
- I did it. Yeah.

01:24:39.377 --> 01:24:42.612
And as I was praying for you,

01:24:42.614 --> 01:24:45.517
I started praying for me.

01:24:47.252 --> 01:24:48.451
You know?

01:24:48.453 --> 01:24:53.625
I walked into that house not
believing, and I walked out...

01:24:57.496 --> 01:24:58.563
Come here.

01:25:00.499 --> 01:25:01.633
I love you.

01:25:03.502 --> 01:25:05.335
- <i>One more lap?</i>
- Yeah.

01:25:05.337 --> 01:25:06.571
Is that cool?

01:25:07.839 --> 01:25:11.543
Look, I just want to say
that I'm really sorry.

01:25:12.411 --> 01:25:14.578
For what?

01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:18.248
I really thought it was part of
the plan for me to run tomorrow

01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:19.582
and get us out of here.

01:25:19.584 --> 01:25:22.452
Hey, you don't need
to be sorry for that.

01:25:22.454 --> 01:25:24.287
So it wasn't part of the plan.
You know what?

01:25:24.289 --> 01:25:26.589
Maybe there's something
better waiting for us.

01:25:26.591 --> 01:25:28.758
It was just
so clear to me.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.597
And I'm... just really
sorry that I let you down.

01:25:33.599 --> 01:25:34.567
Hey.

01:25:35.668 --> 01:25:36.602
Davey.

01:25:38.337 --> 01:25:40.239
You didn't let me down, bud.

01:25:41.874 --> 01:25:43.608
You couldn't let me down.

01:25:44.876 --> 01:25:46.478
All right?

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.480
Why don't you run
in my place?

01:25:50.482 --> 01:25:51.849
What?

01:25:51.851 --> 01:25:53.718
Look, if...

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.721
if you stay here,
nothing changes, we're stuck.

01:25:56.723 --> 01:25:59.625
But if you run tomorrow,
you never know what can happen.

01:26:01.394 --> 01:26:04.528
That could be our last chance
at getting out of here.

01:26:04.530 --> 01:26:05.766
Don't you want
to take it?

01:26:07.632 --> 01:26:09.800
- <i>Your knee's good to run?</i>
- Yeah, my knee's great, Coach.

01:26:09.802 --> 01:26:12.770
I've been training with Dave
the whole track season.

01:26:12.772 --> 01:26:14.507
Sticking with him,
step for step.

01:26:16.776 --> 01:26:22.315
Coach. I mean, this is
really important for me.

01:26:24.484 --> 01:26:25.518
It's important for Dave.

01:26:26.352 --> 01:26:27.621
I can see that.

01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:33.659
I'll probably have to
sign you in as your brother.

01:26:35.862 --> 01:26:39.097
That doesn't sound
very official though.

01:26:39.099 --> 01:26:41.869
You know, we'll cross that
bridge when we come to it, but...

01:26:45.538 --> 01:26:48.372
I'll take the heat.

01:26:48.374 --> 01:26:52.911
Truth is, may not be the worst thing for
me to get fired from this track coach job.

01:26:52.913 --> 01:26:57.782
Guys running around in a circle,
it never really interested me.

01:26:57.784 --> 01:27:00.551
You hand a young man a ball and
have folks try to tackle him?

01:27:00.553 --> 01:27:02.621
That is a sport.

01:27:02.623 --> 01:27:04.858
- Yeah, Coach. That's football.
- Yeah, well, you see my point.

01:27:05.592 --> 01:27:07.361
Yeah.

01:27:08.662 --> 01:27:10.829
You boys
are due some breaks.

01:27:10.831 --> 01:27:14.434
I'll do anything I can
to help you, son.

01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:17.671
- Thank you, Coach.
- Yeah.

01:27:19.173 --> 01:27:22.475
<i>Let me make a couple calls.
I'll get you cleared to run.</i>

01:27:49.736 --> 01:27:50.869
Zach.

01:27:50.871 --> 01:27:52.706
What are you doing
in here, son?

01:27:54.843 --> 01:27:56.711
Coach, you really think
I can win this?

01:28:06.188 --> 01:28:09.756
Well...
these boys out there...

01:28:11.491 --> 01:28:13.726
they're all real
track athletes.

01:28:13.728 --> 01:28:16.662
They been training all year,
maybe their whole lives, for this moment.

01:28:16.664 --> 01:28:19.999
Coach, if this is a pep talk,
it really needs some work.

01:28:20.001 --> 01:28:24.637
But... I know,
without a shadow of a doubt

01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:28.674
that they don't have the heart
or the drive that you have.

01:28:28.676 --> 01:28:32.477
I've never seen someone sprint down
a sideline the way that you do, son.

01:28:32.479 --> 01:28:34.847
Whoo!

01:28:34.849 --> 01:28:37.783
You think any of these fellas out there
could catch you on a football field?

01:28:37.785 --> 01:28:39.919
- No, sir.
- Right.

01:28:39.921 --> 01:28:42.455
So you're really just running four
football fields then, aren't you?

01:28:42.457 --> 01:28:44.592
A turn here, turn there.

01:28:45.627 --> 01:28:48.028
Yeah.

01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:50.733
Just remember, you're only
running against yourself.

01:28:52.768 --> 01:28:56.471
You got about 45 seconds
to give it all that you got.

01:28:57.538 --> 01:28:59.741
It's you against the clock.

01:29:03.811 --> 01:29:05.680
So, come on.
There's someone I want you to meet.

01:29:13.088 --> 01:29:15.055
Hey, Zach.

01:29:15.057 --> 01:29:17.858
Coach tells me your knee's
back in playing shape.

01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:20.793
- Yes, sir. Yeah. It's better than ever.
- Well, good.

01:29:20.795 --> 01:29:24.031
Good. I'm looking forward to
seeing what you got out there.

01:29:24.033 --> 01:29:27.970
Man, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you scouted track too.

01:29:28.904 --> 01:29:30.572
I don't.

01:29:30.973 --> 01:29:32.574
Good luck.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.035
Runners, take your mark.

01:30:02.105 --> 01:30:03.472
Set!

01:31:42.206 --> 01:31:46.941
Nanny. Guess what. The Florida
scout was at the track meet, okay?

01:31:46.943 --> 01:31:49.845
I talked to him.
I got second place.

01:31:49.847 --> 01:31:51.712
- <i>Zach...</i>
- I got second place!

01:31:51.714 --> 01:31:53.050
- <i>Zachary.</i>
- What?

01:31:54.852 --> 01:31:56.954
- Nanny, what's wrong?
- <i>It's your brother.</i>

01:31:57.755 --> 01:31:59.123
Nanny.

01:33:39.825 --> 01:33:41.160
Hey, Zach, I don't...

01:33:46.331 --> 01:33:47.966
I, um...

01:33:50.835 --> 01:33:52.271
Your brother.

01:33:54.806 --> 01:33:57.877
I remember when he was a boy, he used
to sleep with this under his pillow.

01:33:59.111 --> 01:34:02.982
And, um, I got it
from his hospital.

01:34:55.301 --> 01:34:56.936
All right, let's go, boys.

01:35:00.407 --> 01:35:01.907
Hey there, pretty lady.

01:35:03.209 --> 01:35:04.344
Hi.

01:35:20.259 --> 01:35:21.892
<i>Davey is my hero.</i>

01:35:21.894 --> 01:35:24.928
<i>That may sound like a funny thing
to say about your little brother.</i>

01:35:24.930 --> 01:35:29.367
You see, he taught me, in life there
are only two ways you can be running:

01:35:29.369 --> 01:35:32.070
to God or from God.

01:35:32.072 --> 01:35:37.309
And I spent so much time running from God.
And I'm pretty fast.

01:35:37.311 --> 01:35:42.214
And looking back, it wasn't his death,
but the way Dave lived his life.

01:35:42.216 --> 01:35:46.084
How he never gave up on me, and not
only showed me love, but the truth.

01:35:46.086 --> 01:35:47.652
<i>That's what turned me around.</i>

01:35:47.654 --> 01:35:51.158
<i>And the moment I did,
Jesus was there with his arms wide open.</i>

01:35:54.328 --> 01:35:58.098
<i>I just want to encourage anyone who
feels like they're running in life...</i>

01:35:59.667 --> 01:36:02.134
<i>to stop,</i>

01:36:02.136 --> 01:36:04.872
<i>turn around and embrace
who's chasing them.</i>

01:36:07.074 --> 01:36:09.274
<i>'Cause I'll tell you what.</i>

01:36:09.276 --> 01:36:11.376
<i>He loves you.</i>

01:36:11.378 --> 01:36:13.246
<i>He loves you like crazy.</i>

01:36:43.511 --> 01:36:47.012
Hey, Truett. Welcome
to Gator nation, man.

01:36:47.014 --> 01:36:49.148
- Thanks, brother.
- Congratulations, man. I love your story.

01:36:49.150 --> 01:36:50.717
- Keep it up, all right?
- Yes, sir.

01:36:50.719 --> 01:36:52.488
Just stay strong.
