00:16.785 --> 00:18.309
<i>A diplomatic mission!</i>

00:19.005 --> 00:20.603
<i>As dissent threatens to tear apart</i>

00:20.771 --> 00:22.771
<i>the peaceful Mandalore system,</i>

00:23.245 --> 00:24.857
<i>Duchess Satine struggles</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:28.025
<i>to protect her people against
the escalating violence.</i>

00:28.775 --> 00:30.154
<i>Betrayed by two of her</i>

00:30.322 --> 00:32.948
<i>trusted allies,
Satine now travels to Coruscant.</i>

00:33.595 --> 00:35.440
<i>There, she hopes
to convince the Senate</i>

00:35.565 --> 00:37.078
<i>that a destructive splinter group,</i>

00:37.203 --> 00:38.122
<i>Death Watch,</i>

00:38.247 --> 00:41.447
<i>does not represent the entire
Mandalorian government.</i>

00:50.235 --> 00:53.190
With your Death Watch army in place,

00:53.315 --> 00:57.315
now all we need do
is to sit and wait.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.366
<i>But for how long?</i>

00:59.655 --> 01:01.310
<i>My men are anxious to fight.</i>

01:01.478 --> 01:04.480
Considering the plot
we've just set in motion,

01:04.735 --> 01:05.810
<i>I assure you,</i>

01:05.935 --> 01:09.110
<i>the Republic will oblige you
the fight you're looking for.</i>

01:09.278 --> 01:12.498
<i>First, send a Death Watch assassin
to Coruscant.</i>

01:13.225 --> 01:15.985
<i>The Duchess of Mandalore must die.</i>

02:04.935 --> 02:05.958
Prime Minister.

02:06.385 --> 02:08.377
You found
the Death Watch armies, then?

02:10.145 --> 02:11.660
They are preparing for battle.

02:11.785 --> 02:14.400
But if they attack, it would strengthen
the people's resolve

02:14.525 --> 02:16.830
not to join
the Death Watch movement.

02:16.955 --> 02:18.500
They will never be strong enough

02:18.625 --> 02:20.973
to take over Mandalore
without the will of the people.

02:21.405 --> 02:24.350
Not if the Republic
has a military presence here.

02:24.475 --> 02:27.396
Their occupation will turn
the Death Watch from terrorists

02:27.564 --> 02:29.774
to liberators in the eyes
of the people.

02:30.005 --> 02:33.055
But how can we stop the Republic
from coming here?

02:33.635 --> 02:37.465
Our fate now lies
in the hands of Duchess Satine.

02:42.795 --> 02:44.705
It grieves me to say it,

02:45.046 --> 02:49.046
But Death Watch is now
a significant, deadly threat.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.550
Mandalore is making great strides

02:51.675 --> 02:53.900
to find the leaders
of this terrorist movement.

02:54.025 --> 02:57.150
They are not powerful enough
to destabilize our government.

02:57.275 --> 02:59.553
We will resolve this
without conflict.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.390
If the Republic gets involved
in our affairs,

03:02.515 --> 03:04.973
it will only lead
to further violence.

03:05.215 --> 03:08.020
Thus, I shall reassert
our position of neutrality.

03:08.395 --> 03:09.895
Talk of an idealist.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.850
No, those are the words
of a pacifist

03:12.975 --> 03:16.237
and a people
who have chosen nonviolent action.

03:16.475 --> 03:18.190
That may be so, Duchess.

03:18.315 --> 03:22.315
However, this message was delivered
to my staff just this morning.

03:23.775 --> 03:26.525
I think you shall find it
most illuminating.

03:28.485 --> 03:30.390
<i>The actions by our government</i>

03:30.515 --> 03:33.379
<i>have taken us into a period
of civil war.</i>

03:33.635 --> 03:36.680
<i>To acknowledge it
would be to invite panic in the streets.</i>

03:36.805 --> 03:38.975
Duchess? Do you know this man?

03:39.895 --> 03:42.680
Deputy minister Jerec.
He's a dear friend.

03:43.015 --> 03:47.015
<i>It is more than mere possibility,
more than eventuality.</i>

03:47.745 --> 03:49.061
<i>- It is here.
- Stop!</i>

03:49.705 --> 03:52.590
Deputy minister Jerec
is an honorable man.

03:52.715 --> 03:55.246
He would never commit such lies
to the record.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.737
The Mandalorian government
holds no secrets from its people.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.845
If only that were true.

04:02.505 --> 04:05.505
<i>Death Watch is far stronger
than we once thought.</i>

04:05.975 --> 04:07.955
If we are to combat them
effectively,

04:08.535 --> 04:10.374
we must have Republic assistance.

04:11.955 --> 04:14.378
<i>Instead, this government
acts out of pride</i>

04:14.546 --> 04:17.574
<i>- and rejects the help of the Jedi.
- It's not true. It's not true!</i>

04:18.007 --> 04:20.700
<i>The Duchess Satine will
ultimately cause our defeat.</i>

04:20.825 --> 04:22.265
<i>Make no mistake.</i>

04:22.825 --> 04:26.075
Republic intervention
is absolutely necessary.

04:27.675 --> 04:30.600
This isn't right.
Something here isn't right.

04:30.725 --> 04:32.730
I wish to speak to Jerec
immediately.

04:33.605 --> 04:36.815
Sadly, deputy minister Jerec
perished this morning

04:37.155 --> 04:39.555
in a Death Watch bombing
on Kalevala.

04:40.345 --> 04:43.155
Let us ensure that his death
was not in vain.

04:44.035 --> 04:47.940
Let us commit our military might
to defending the Mandalorian people.

04:48.065 --> 04:49.065
Defending?

04:49.525 --> 04:51.340
You mean to occupy our home.

04:51.465 --> 04:54.752
You would trample our right
to self-determination.

04:55.205 --> 04:57.087
We mean to save your people.

04:57.305 --> 04:59.820
You will turn our planet
into a military target,

04:59.945 --> 05:01.860
which will bring the war to us.

05:01.985 --> 05:04.678
Mandalore must remain
a neutral system.

05:05.925 --> 05:08.225
The vote shall commence
In the next session.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.685
Duchess!

05:12.985 --> 05:14.485
Satine, wait.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.610
I just heard
what happened in the Senate.

05:22.315 --> 05:24.170
You're sweet to be concerned,

05:24.295 --> 05:25.970
but I promise, I'll be all right.

05:26.095 --> 05:27.345
I am concerned.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.161
We're friends, are we not?

05:29.925 --> 05:32.705
Yes, friends and nothing more.

05:34.099 --> 05:35.100
As your friend,

05:35.225 --> 05:38.379
I don't think you should make
any decisions in this state of mind.

05:38.595 --> 05:40.045
This state of mind?

05:40.335 --> 05:43.133
And what state of mind
would that be, precisely?

05:43.725 --> 05:45.175
What I'm saying is,

05:45.586 --> 05:47.596
any person would be hysterical
by now, but...

05:47.835 --> 05:48.885
Hysterical?

05:49.010 --> 05:53.105
The Republic is attempting
to force its will upon innocent people.

05:53.485 --> 05:57.085
- I only meant that...
- I'm surprised you're not hysterical.

05:57.325 --> 06:01.180
Perhaps if more citizens got hysterical,
they'd be more inclined to speak up

06:01.305 --> 06:03.790
when the Republic
tramples on their rights.

06:03.915 --> 06:05.865
Rushing in like this, it's...

06:06.335 --> 06:07.449
It's foolhardy.

06:07.785 --> 06:11.910
Ironic words from a man who spends
his days running hither and yon,

06:12.035 --> 06:16.070
wielding his lightsaber
with deadly force as if on a crusade.

06:16.195 --> 06:20.130
Why should I listen to someone
who so frequently relies on violence?

06:20.255 --> 06:23.105
In my opinion,
you're the one who's foolhardy.

06:50.225 --> 06:51.294
What's happening?

06:51.539 --> 06:52.923
It's the navigation system.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.915
Get her out of here.

07:01.615 --> 07:03.365
There's a platform ahead.

07:03.575 --> 07:05.132
I'll try to get closer.

07:05.545 --> 07:06.630
No, stop!

07:06.755 --> 07:07.755
Aramis!

07:09.221 --> 07:10.095
Jump!

07:28.065 --> 07:31.450
What do you mean,
no charges are to be filed? None at all?

07:31.715 --> 07:33.430
Someone tried to kill me.

07:33.555 --> 07:36.163
The controls on my speeder
were compromised.

07:36.485 --> 07:38.400
Sadly, my dear, there is no proof

07:38.525 --> 07:40.527
anyone tampered with anything.

07:40.845 --> 07:43.629
I'm afraid it might've been
just an accident.

07:43.895 --> 07:44.970
An accident?

07:45.095 --> 07:48.300
And it just happened to coincide
with me defending my home world?

07:48.655 --> 07:50.385
I agree with Satine.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.165
Well, finally.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.410
It proves
what I've been saying all along.

07:54.535 --> 07:56.150
Death Watch is out of control.

07:56.275 --> 07:58.525
The Republic must step in and help.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.354
No, wait. I didn't...

08:00.615 --> 08:03.180
You can't keep them reined in,
obviously.

08:03.305 --> 08:04.395
So we will.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.975
This is patently offensive.

08:07.285 --> 08:08.570
You can't do this.

08:08.895 --> 08:11.495
Unfortunately,
it's up to the Senate now.

08:11.885 --> 08:15.536
I'm sure they'll make
a reasoned and thoughtful decision.

08:23.965 --> 08:25.990
I just heard about your accident.

08:26.115 --> 08:27.214
Those two are...

08:28.075 --> 08:29.725
This government will...

08:30.955 --> 08:32.323
Tell me what happened.

08:32.890 --> 08:33.890
I'm fine.

08:34.015 --> 08:35.015
I wasn't hurt.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.515
I didn't want to worry you.

08:36.905 --> 08:38.760
Well, I'm afraid, on that count,

08:38.885 --> 08:40.784
you've failed spectacularly.

08:41.583 --> 08:42.714
Look what happened.

08:42.985 --> 08:44.210
Look what happened?

08:44.335 --> 08:47.025
This attack proves
I've upset someone.

08:47.488 --> 08:48.741
I'm on the right track.

08:49.105 --> 08:52.531
This attack proves your enemies
are here even on Coruscant.

08:53.985 --> 08:56.910
You're not going to let Republic
authorities handle this, are you?

08:57.255 --> 08:58.704
You're not backing down.

08:58.925 --> 09:01.700
Republic authorities?
Certainly not.

09:01.825 --> 09:04.140
I'm on my way to the Ministry
of Intelligence right now

09:04.265 --> 09:05.715
to meet my contact.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.040
Don't you see?

09:08.165 --> 09:11.020
You need your friends with you,
not held at arm's length.

09:11.895 --> 09:13.630
In your quest to be self-reliant,

09:13.755 --> 09:16.455
have you decided to cut your friends
out of your life?

09:18.095 --> 09:19.385
I don't know.

09:20.855 --> 09:22.605
Senator, what is it?

09:23.015 --> 09:25.015
The Senate completed its vote.

09:25.195 --> 09:27.191
They've decided
in favor of occupation.

09:27.645 --> 09:31.069
When did this happen?
The vote was supposed to be tomorrow.

09:31.485 --> 09:33.690
It was during your meeting
with the Chancellor.

09:33.815 --> 09:36.450
Your accident
accelerated the Senate's decision.

09:36.575 --> 09:40.120
Republic forces are set to leave
for Mandalore at sunrise tomorrow.

09:40.465 --> 09:41.465
You see?

09:41.595 --> 09:43.045
I was right before.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.635
Counting on the Republic
is a mistake.

10:18.215 --> 10:21.036
I don't have much time.
They're following me.

10:25.715 --> 10:28.015
You've put yourself in great danger.

10:28.231 --> 10:29.483
I will never forget it.

10:29.805 --> 10:31.005
I had to come.

10:31.235 --> 10:32.422
This is worth it.

10:33.795 --> 10:35.180
Where did you get this?

10:35.305 --> 10:38.240
Buried deep in the evidence facility
at the ministry.

10:38.365 --> 10:40.389
It was not easy to find, believe me.

10:45.335 --> 10:46.735
You were right.

10:47.045 --> 10:49.045
Someone faked the evidence.

10:49.425 --> 10:53.000
The recording presented to the Senate
was not the full recording,

10:53.125 --> 10:54.585
but this disc is.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.496
You must show the Senate.

11:00.255 --> 11:01.255
Davu!

11:10.465 --> 11:12.879
We have a shooting in sector GL-5.

11:13.355 --> 11:16.055
Subject identified
as Duchess Satine Kryze.

11:18.385 --> 11:20.200
Hands where we can see them.

11:20.325 --> 11:21.888
You are coming with us.

11:22.205 --> 11:23.835
I didn't kill him.

11:25.175 --> 11:28.395
Subject identified
as Duchess Satine Kryze.

12:22.145 --> 12:24.301
We spotted her.
She's heading into the alley.

12:27.435 --> 12:29.498
Cancel that.
She's escaping in a speeder,

12:29.666 --> 12:31.466
heading for section IG-44.

12:48.915 --> 12:50.727
<i>Duchess Satine escaped again,</i>

12:50.965 --> 12:52.687
<i>but I took out an informant.</i>

12:52.905 --> 12:55.680
Not sure if he successfully
delivered something to her,

12:55.805 --> 12:57.401
but it looked like a handoff.

12:57.685 --> 12:58.685
<i>Find her.</i>

12:58.925 --> 13:01.738
<i>Whatever she's carrying
may compromise our plan.</i>

13:15.955 --> 13:19.453
My Lord, everything is going
as you instructed.

13:19.805 --> 13:22.145
<i>Death Watch is prepared to fight?</i>

13:24.065 --> 13:26.915
The people have been worked
into such a frenzy

13:27.225 --> 13:29.475
that when the Republic does arrive,

13:30.055 --> 13:33.315
the Death Watch
will be considered the heroes.

13:33.715 --> 13:34.715
<i>Excellent.</i>

13:35.155 --> 13:38.170
<i>The Republic occupation force
is loading their ships</i>

13:38.295 --> 13:39.995
<i>and will arrive on time,</i>

13:40.488 --> 13:43.338
<i>if the Duchess Satine
does not get in the way.</i>

13:43.965 --> 13:47.324
The Duchess Satine
will not be in the way much longer.

13:48.005 --> 13:51.305
One of the Death Watch assassins
is taking care of her.

13:55.375 --> 13:56.590
Excuse me, sir.

13:56.715 --> 14:00.215
If you see this woman,
report her to the local authorities.

14:03.445 --> 14:06.075
I don't think he understands us.
Let's try someone else.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.065
Obi-Wan, come in.

14:11.205 --> 14:12.855
<i>Obi-wan, are you there?</i>

14:13.645 --> 14:14.845
Where are you?

14:15.085 --> 14:17.731
Mas Amedda has demanded
you turn yourself in.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.316
<i>I know.
Listen to me.</i>

14:20.625 --> 14:21.975
I need your help.

14:40.995 --> 14:43.048
<i>Have you seen this woman?</i>

14:54.735 --> 14:55.894
Nice disguise.

15:05.665 --> 15:07.465
Seeing you all right is...

15:07.785 --> 15:09.157
Well, it's a relief.

15:09.555 --> 15:11.400
You should turn yourself in.

15:11.525 --> 15:13.995
We've both sworn
a loyalty to the Republic.

15:14.225 --> 15:17.082
Believe me, neither one of us
is breaking our oath.

15:17.455 --> 15:19.235
And this will prove it.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.545
I need to get it
into the proper hands.

15:24.685 --> 15:27.010
But the Republic guards
are hunting you, which means...

15:27.135 --> 15:30.690
Whoever doctored this recording
is likely in the government itself.

15:30.815 --> 15:33.460
If you set foot inside the Senate,
they'll take you.

15:33.585 --> 15:36.935
And the disc will be destroyed
before anyone can see it,

15:37.265 --> 15:39.938
which is why
you must take the disc to Padmé.

15:57.907 --> 15:58.707
Blast it.

16:05.725 --> 16:08.480
Where will you be while I'm
in the Senate? What if they find you?

16:08.605 --> 16:11.052
They won't.
I'm going to surrender to them.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.270
What?

16:12.395 --> 16:15.420
You'll need a distraction
to enter the Senate freely.

16:15.545 --> 16:18.360
I can't risk them searching you
just because you and I

16:18.485 --> 16:19.550
are associates.

16:19.675 --> 16:20.725
I'm a Jedi.

16:20.995 --> 16:22.272
They wouldn't dare.

16:22.725 --> 16:24.675
Things are changing, my dear.

17:35.605 --> 17:36.605
Excuse me.

17:38.195 --> 17:39.766
I believe you are looking for me.

17:52.085 --> 17:53.935
The occupation of Mandalore

17:54.175 --> 17:57.283
will usher in a new level of security
for the Republic

17:57.451 --> 17:59.601
and its fight against corruption.

18:00.275 --> 18:03.248
- If there are no objections...
- Supreme Chancellor,

18:03.745 --> 18:06.584
there has been a development
in the case of Mandalore's neutrality.

18:06.855 --> 18:09.605
The chair recognizes
the Senator from Naboo.

18:09.945 --> 18:13.949
I think this should cast a new light
on the so-called evidence we saw.

18:20.095 --> 18:22.045
<i>The actions by our government</i>

18:22.185 --> 18:24.785
<i>have taken us into a period
of civil war.</i>

18:25.485 --> 18:27.147
<i>To acknowledge it would be to invite</i>

18:27.315 --> 18:28.865
<i>panic in the streets.</i>

18:29.415 --> 18:32.415
<i>Death Watch is far stronger
than we once thought.</i>

18:32.665 --> 18:34.670
<i>But we have been training for this.</i>

18:34.795 --> 18:36.336
<i>We can stop them.</i>

18:36.845 --> 18:39.284
<i>But if we are to combat them
effectively,</i>

18:39.452 --> 18:41.870
<i>we must have the temerity
to stand strong</i>

18:42.038 --> 18:43.588
<i>in the name of peace.</i>

18:44.373 --> 18:46.023
<i>And if we are to do so,</i>

18:46.175 --> 18:48.957
<i>we must reject
any of Republic assistance.</i>

18:50.115 --> 18:51.115
<i>Instead,</i>

18:51.425 --> 18:53.175
<i>this government will act.</i>

18:53.765 --> 18:56.810
<i>It acts not out of pride
but for safety.</i>

18:57.887 --> 19:01.287
<i>Intervention by the Republic
will inflame the opposition.</i>

19:01.865 --> 19:05.765
<i>And this is why our government
rejects the help of the Jedi.</i>

19:06.305 --> 19:08.705
<i>We must listen
to the Duchess Satine.</i>

19:09.675 --> 19:10.825
<i>If we do not,</i>

19:11.165 --> 19:13.465
<i>we will ultimately cause our defeat.</i>

19:14.975 --> 19:16.825
<i>All troops will stand down.</i>

19:17.005 --> 19:19.305
<i>All troops will stand down.</i>

19:20.015 --> 19:21.075
Unacceptable!

19:21.395 --> 19:23.620
You promised us
we would reclaim Mandalore

19:23.745 --> 19:25.795
from these weak-willed cowards.

19:26.715 --> 19:28.374
I will order my men to attack.

19:28.725 --> 19:29.925
And if you do,

19:30.075 --> 19:32.675
you'll hold the planet
for perhaps a day.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.050
Without the backing of my forces
or your people,

19:37.175 --> 19:40.145
your revolution will be over
before it begins.

19:41.095 --> 19:44.145
A neophyte such as you
wouldn't know these things,

19:44.795 --> 19:45.796
but I do.

19:46.615 --> 19:49.848
I have other ways
to accomplish our goals.

19:58.085 --> 19:59.100
Thankfully,

19:59.225 --> 20:01.950
with the revelation
of this new information,

20:02.075 --> 20:05.498
the occupation of Mandalore
is no longer necessary.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.320
The person to thank
is Duchess Satine.

20:08.445 --> 20:09.690
She found the proof.

20:09.815 --> 20:11.425
I require no thanks.

20:15.425 --> 20:17.260
The Senate held
an emergency session,

20:17.385 --> 20:20.085
and the Republic forces
have been ordered to stand down.

20:20.725 --> 20:23.190
Allow me to offer
a most sincere apology

20:23.315 --> 20:25.465
on behalf of the entire Republic.

20:26.065 --> 20:28.015
You are a most loyal servant,

20:28.675 --> 20:30.675
and we are all grateful.

20:32.439 --> 20:33.439
Grateful.

20:35.265 --> 20:38.200
Chancellor, if you and Mas Amedda
would join me for a moment,

20:38.325 --> 20:42.175
we have some logistics to discuss
to ratify the Senate's decision.

20:43.465 --> 20:45.952
But for you,
this wouldn't have happened.

20:46.495 --> 20:49.360
No, it was
your unshakable faith in your people

20:49.485 --> 20:52.333
and your determination
that brought about this result.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.565
I appreciate that.

20:55.575 --> 20:57.975
But still,
who is behind all of this?

20:58.405 --> 21:00.192
Who tampered with that recording?

21:00.317 --> 21:03.428
Who tried to convict me of murder
and throw me in jail?

21:03.705 --> 21:04.855
I'm not sure.

21:05.405 --> 21:07.098
But as you said yourself,

21:07.755 --> 21:09.255
things are changing.

21:09.875 --> 21:13.275
And sometimes the line
between friend and foe is blurred,

21:14.115 --> 21:15.565
now more than ever.
