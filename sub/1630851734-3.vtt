TOM HIDDLESTON: <i>Thyme...</i>

00:05.547 --> 00:06.965
<i>No, the other "Time."</i>

00:07.716 --> 00:09.592
<i>Thank you. Much better.</i>

00:09.676 --> 00:10.760
(CLEARS THROAT)

00:11.219 --> 00:12.220
<i>Time...</i>

00:12.887 --> 00:15.515
<i>For some, time is a wheel.</i>

00:15.598 --> 00:19.644
<i>An infinite repetition of what came before</i>
<i>and what is yet to come.</i>

00:19.728 --> 00:22.105
<i>Looping endlessly over and over.</i>

00:23.189 --> 00:25.775
<i>For others, time is an arrow.</i>

00:26.818 --> 00:28.236
<i>Pressing faithfully forward.</i>

00:31.072 --> 00:34.451
<i>We began</i> Loki <i>on February 10, 2020,</i>

00:35.326 --> 00:37.078
<i>at eight o'clock in the morning</i>

00:37.162 --> 00:40.874
<i>and wrapped production 299 days later.</i>

00:41.458 --> 00:45.170
<i>Approximately 7,176 hours.</i>

00:45.253 --> 00:48.673
<i>Or 430,560 minutes,</i>

00:48.757 --> 00:51.634
<i>working and breathing</i>
<i>and dreaming with the show.</i>

00:53.053 --> 00:55.930
<i>Take that number and whittle it down</i>
<i>with many clever edits,</i>

00:56.014 --> 00:58.266
<i>and you get six episodes.</i>

00:58.349 --> 01:02.937
<i>Totaling 280 minutes and 17 seconds</i>
<i>of programming.</i>

01:03.855 --> 01:06.524
<i>Now, whittle the experience down</i>
<i>even further,</i>

01:06.608 --> 01:08.610
<i>and you get this one-hour...</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:10.904
<i>Give or take, documentary.</i>

01:11.988 --> 01:14.657
<i>A comparatively brief time capsule.</i>

01:16.034 --> 01:18.036
<i>A remembrance of things past.</i>

01:18.703 --> 01:22.582
<i>Given the constraints,</i>
<i>we shouldn't waste a single second.</i>

01:23.500 --> 01:26.127
<i>Let's go back to the beginning.</i>

01:28.463 --> 01:33.468
At the end of the first day,
I cannot believe that I'm doing this.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.512
I literally cannot believe it's happening.

01:35.595 --> 01:39.057
Um, I first wore this costume
ten years ago.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.768
-I can't believe I'm still wearing it.
-(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)

01:41.851 --> 01:44.896
Um, and I'm so excited about this show.

01:44.979 --> 01:48.942
Um, I'm so grateful to all of you
for everything you're gonna do on it.

01:49.025 --> 01:53.363
So, um, thank you for day one of 849.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.324
-And onward we march.
-(PEOPLE CLAPPING)

01:56.533 --> 02:00.328
I remember going to see
the first <i>Iron Man </i>in 2008.

02:00.411 --> 02:03.957
<i>And I was actually in Sweden, working on</i>
<i>a project there with Kenneth Branagh.</i>

02:04.040 --> 02:05.667
And he went to see it the next weekend,

02:05.750 --> 02:08.128
and we both thought,
"God, <i>Iron Man</i> was extraordinary."

02:08.211 --> 02:11.214
<i>And then he got the job</i>
<i>of directing </i>Thor...

02:11.297 --> 02:14.676
I kind of joked about, you know...

02:14.759 --> 02:16.219
I think once we were on stage,

02:16.302 --> 02:20.723
and I came in with an empty water cooler
and pretended it was the hammer of Thor.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.143
<i>He was able to invite me to audition</i>

02:23.226 --> 02:27.856
<i>'cause he knew that it was going to be</i>
<i>a huge opportunity for so many people.</i>

02:29.274 --> 02:31.526
It's a long time
since I've seen you smile.

02:31.609 --> 02:37.073
HIDDLESTON: <i>I remember,</i>
<i>as clear as day, the first auditions.</i>

02:37.157 --> 02:40.160
<i>I almost remember the scenes.</i>
<i>There was a scene between two brothers,</i>

02:40.243 --> 02:42.245
and they couldn't reveal
the character names.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.622
One was called Michael,
the other was called Lucas.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.749
I believe I learned both sets of lines.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.751
So you're saying...

02:51.337 --> 02:53.590
that our friends will stand with me
in defending our home,

02:53.673 --> 02:54.883
but my own brother will not?

02:56.384 --> 03:00.180
<i>And then a month later, Chris Hemsworth</i>
<i>and I got the call on the same day.</i>

03:00.263 --> 03:03.349
Chris and I got together,
and the moment I met him, I thought...

03:03.433 --> 03:06.102
"This is the beginning
of the most extraordinary journey.

03:07.353 --> 03:11.608
<i>"And I don't know where it's going to go,</i>
<i>but I really like this person.</i>

03:12.275 --> 03:14.068
<i>"This could be something."</i>

03:14.152 --> 03:18.531
From that point on,
I just threw myself at it.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.200
I threw my whole soul at it.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.831
Tom is a fan favorite. People loved
what he's brought to the character Loki.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.211
<i>He's a character that has always</i>
<i>found a way to come back organically</i>

03:31.294 --> 03:33.838
<i>in new, and interesting,</i>
<i>and exciting ways.</i>

03:33.922 --> 03:37.592
Your savior is here!

03:37.675 --> 03:41.012
As we were looking for the kind of stories
we wanted to tell on Disney Plus,

03:41.095 --> 03:42.722
Tom just seemed like a real no-brainer

03:42.805 --> 03:46.684
<i>because of the richness of that character</i>
<i>and the depth of that fan base.</i>

03:46.768 --> 03:50.188
Something happened after <i>Avengers One.</i>

03:50.271 --> 03:53.107
<i>That's when I realized that</i>
<i>Loki as a character</i>

03:53.191 --> 03:57.153
<i>had taken on a life of its own</i>
<i>in the mind of the audience.</i>

03:57.237 --> 04:00.615
<i>So that by the time</i>
<i>we got to Comic-Con in 2013,</i>

04:00.698 --> 04:04.744
<i>Kevin Feige had this idea that</i>
<i>I should go out on stage in character.</i>

04:04.827 --> 04:08.957
<i>And I said to him,</i>
<i>"That's insane and amazing.</i>

04:09.040 --> 04:10.875
"I'm in. Let's go."

04:10.959 --> 04:14.170
<i>It was a moment in time</i>
<i>that is unrepeatable.</i>

04:14.254 --> 04:17.674
<i>I don't think I'll ever have a moment</i>
<i>like that ever again.</i>

04:17.757 --> 04:19.592
<i>It was like stepping off...</i>

04:19.676 --> 04:24.514
Somehow out of the environment,
into the world, as the character.

04:24.597 --> 04:28.226
And hearing and feeling
the energy in that room

04:28.309 --> 04:30.186
was something I will never forget.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.813
HIDDLESTON: Say my name.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.065
-CROWD: Loki!
-(LOUDLY) Say my name!

04:34.148 --> 04:37.402

04:37.485 --> 04:39.404
CROWD: Loki!

04:39.487 --> 04:41.698
<i>And I think after that,</i>
<i>it was, very generously,</i>

04:41.781 --> 04:46.744
<i>that Kevin Feige, and Louis D'Esposito,</i>
<i>and Victoria Alonso at Marvel thought,</i>

04:46.828 --> 04:49.455
"Well, Loki's got to hang around
for a bit longer." (CHUCKLES)

04:51.916 --> 04:56.296
I, Loki, Prince of Asgard,

04:57.547 --> 05:01.009
Odinson, rightful king of Jotunheim,

05:02.468 --> 05:04.095
God of Mischief...

05:04.178 --> 05:07.140
HIDDLESTON: <i>I remember meeting</i>
<i>Joe and Anthony Russo.</i>

05:07.223 --> 05:09.726
<i>And they said, </i>"Infinity War<i> is in...</i>

05:09.809 --> 05:13.563
"It's a labyrinthine thing,
and everyone's involved.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.691
<i>"And we're trying to refine</i>
<i>what happens in it.</i>

05:18.651 --> 05:21.070
<i>"There are some things</i>
<i>we're not sure of yet. However...</i>

05:21.863 --> 05:24.782
<i>"we are sure that the opening of this film</i>

05:24.866 --> 05:29.162
<i>"is Loki giving the Tesseract to Thanos."</i>

05:29.245 --> 05:31.998
You really are the worst brother.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.085
<i>"After which he is executed."</i>

05:39.756 --> 05:41.799
And I looked at Kevin, and I said...

05:43.509 --> 05:44.927
"So, that's it?"

05:45.011 --> 05:46.804
And he was like, "Yep."

05:46.888 --> 05:49.432
No resurrections this time.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.476
<i>It's gonna be</i>
<i>an extraordinary moment because...</i>

05:51.559 --> 05:54.937
<i>Immediately, you believe</i>
<i>in the power of Thanos.</i>

05:58.524 --> 06:00.109
BROUSSARD:
<i>That sacrifice meant something.</i>

06:00.193 --> 06:06.282
<i>And we didn't wanna undo that sacrifice,</i>
<i>or suggest that it never really happened,</i>

06:06.366 --> 06:09.202
or some other sort of way
that felt like it might cheapen

06:09.285 --> 06:12.121
the real emotional weight
of that moment in that film.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.248
We knew we wanted
to tell more stories with Tom.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.250
On my way down
to coordinate search and rescue.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.419
"On my way down
to coordinate search and rescue."

06:18.503 --> 06:21.005
I mean, honestly,
how do you keep your food down...

06:21.089 --> 06:22.298
Shut up.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.051
BROUSSARD: <i>As </i>Endgame<i> was coming together,</i>
<i>the idea that,</i>

06:25.134 --> 06:29.180
<i>throughout the time travel misadventures</i>
<i>of the Avengers, something goes wrong...</i>

06:29.263 --> 06:30.932
No stairs!

06:31.682 --> 06:32.725

06:32.809 --> 06:35.186
BROUSSARD: <i>Tom grabs the Cube</i>
<i>and disappears.</i>

06:35.269 --> 06:39.148
It's a complication in that movie that
really sets our heroes on their back foot.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.150
What's interesting is,
it's not dealt with.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.944
<i>We have no idea where that goes.</i>

06:43.027 --> 06:45.988
<i>One of the things that Kevin Feige</i>
<i>and myself were talking about was,</i>

06:46.072 --> 06:51.077
"Could that be a jumping-off point
for a new way to tell a Loki story?"

06:51.160 --> 06:52.328
HUNTER B-15: Variant identified.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.497
I beg your pardon?

07:00.211 --> 07:02.964
BROUSSARD: <i>TV has always been</i>
<i>the medium of the anti-hero.</i>

07:03.047 --> 07:06.509
You think about the great anti-heroes
like Don Draper or Tony Soprano.

07:06.592 --> 07:10.096
There's enough time to kind of understand
what some people might call

07:10.179 --> 07:13.349
<i>"the bad guy" in another movie</i>
<i>or another type of story.</i>

07:13.433 --> 07:15.893
<i>So we really wanted to have</i>
<i>as much runway as possible</i>

07:15.977 --> 07:18.521
<i>to explore kind of what makes Loki tick.</i>

07:19.856 --> 07:21.607
We did the math, and he's...

07:21.691 --> 07:25.403
Loki's been on screen
for less than two hours

07:25.486 --> 07:28.573
over the course of ten years,
and he's made this huge impact.

07:28.656 --> 07:32.326
<i>And suddenly now,</i>
<i>we have six hours to tell this story.</i>

07:32.702 --> 07:34.495
(BOTH GRUNTING)

07:35.163 --> 07:37.123
(SIGHS) That's better.

07:37.206 --> 07:40.376
WRIGHT: <i>It's a serious show.</i>
<i>It's a dramatic show.</i>

07:40.460 --> 07:44.088
<i>It's a thrilling show.</i>
<i>It's a really wacky show.</i>

07:46.215 --> 07:51.012
<i>And it was just this amazing</i>
<i>team of writers, led by Michael Waldron,</i>

07:51.095 --> 07:53.639
<i>just trying to crack</i>

07:53.723 --> 07:59.312
the world and the logic
of how this show works.

07:59.395 --> 08:03.232
<i>"The TVA manages all of time."</i>
<i>What does that mean?</i>

08:03.357 --> 08:06.068
WALDRON: <i>You know, I think a lot</i>
<i>of people, what they expected was, like,</i>

08:06.152 --> 08:07.403
"This'll be <i>Quantum Leap.</i>

08:07.487 --> 08:09.530
"This is gonna be Loki

08:09.614 --> 08:12.241
<i>"influencing historical events."</i>

08:12.325 --> 08:15.786
<i>And my pitch from the first time</i>
<i>I met with those guys is,</i>

08:15.870 --> 08:19.290
<i>"Let's blow up</i>
<i>what people think the show is."</i>

08:19.373 --> 08:20.374
How'd we do?

08:21.250 --> 08:23.586
BROUSSARD: <i>When we were looking</i>
<i>for a director for this series,</i>

08:23.669 --> 08:26.464
we had a lot of interested parties,
a lot of great conversations.

08:26.547 --> 08:30.176
<i>Kate really rose above all of them</i>
<i>because of her take on the material.</i>

08:30.259 --> 08:33.137
I remember my agent
telling me, basically,

08:33.221 --> 08:35.681
"This is just, like, a friendly
kind of meet-and-greet.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.099
"Do not prepare a pitch."

08:37.183 --> 08:40.853
<i>I ignored that and I did, like,</i>
<i>a full-on pitch.</i>

08:40.937 --> 08:44.899
WRIGHT: <i>She came in</i>
<i>with this shock-and-awe pitch</i>

08:44.982 --> 08:49.028
that was the most amazing pitch
that I had ever seen,

08:49.111 --> 08:52.740
where it truly was the...
What the show has become.

08:52.823 --> 08:55.576
<i>And I remember leaving that meeting</i>

08:55.660 --> 08:59.163
<i>feeling like this is a person</i>
<i>who understands the spirit</i>

08:59.247 --> 09:02.083
<i>of what we would love to achieve with it.</i>

09:02.166 --> 09:05.461
<i>And wasn't just going</i>
<i>to execute those ideas,</i>

09:05.545 --> 09:07.713
but that was going to push them
even further.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.800
HERRON: All at the same time,
lift your weapons up towards these guys,

09:10.883 --> 09:12.051
like, ready to fight.

09:12.134 --> 09:15.763
I asked her, "What do you think, Kate,
that the show is about?"

09:15.846 --> 09:19.392
<i>And she said,</i>
<i>"I think it's about self-acceptance.</i>

09:19.475 --> 09:22.812
<i>"You got a character who doesn't know</i>
<i>how to change and grow.</i>

09:22.895 --> 09:25.731
<i>"And we have this amazing story</i>
<i>that's actually about</i>

09:25.815 --> 09:28.067
<i>"coming to terms with who you are."</i>

09:28.150 --> 09:31.654
From that moment, I thought, "This woman
knows what she's doing. She's in."

09:31.737 --> 09:36.200
<i>It was such a human, such a deep insight,</i>
<i>so simply put.</i>

09:36.284 --> 09:39.078
(CHUCKLING) I'm just a bit
of a cheeseball, to be honest.

09:39.161 --> 09:42.665
<i>Like, I just...</i>
<i>I love that it's about self-love</i>

09:42.748 --> 09:44.709
<i>and, like, getting past your demons.</i>

09:44.792 --> 09:48.212
<i>And I think something I always</i>
<i>try and bring to everything I do is,</i>

09:48.296 --> 09:51.340
digging into the emotion
and the truth of that,

09:51.424 --> 09:53.843
and sort of letting the characters
be ugly, in a way.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.678
<i>For me, it feels a bit more real.</i>

09:55.761 --> 09:58.931
Again, I think it's just, like, don't be
scared to tread on each other a bit.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.225
-Okay, okay, nice. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
-'Cause it's like...

10:01.309 --> 10:02.977
-As long as it's okay that we overlap.
-MAN: Here we go. Picture up...

WRIGHT: <i>She has so many real-life</i>
<i>experiences that she puts into the show.</i>

10:09.025 --> 10:14.280
She's worked in a lot of offices
that sound a lot like the TVA,

10:14.363 --> 10:18.618
<i>so she would understand the buttons</i>
<i>to push to drive Loki crazy.</i>

10:19.535 --> 10:20.536
Shh!

10:23.372 --> 10:26.083
HIDDLESTON: <i>The passage of time</i>
<i>may be constant,</i>

10:26.167 --> 10:29.462
<i>but the sensation of time is not.</i>

10:29.545 --> 10:31.547
<i>An hour on the beach,</i>

<i>basking in the briny glow</i>
<i>of utter freedom,</i>

<i>feels very different from an hour-long</i>

10:39.263 --> 10:43.517
<i>And yet, a minute is a minute is a minute.</i>

10:43.601 --> 10:48.356
<i>We move forward one minute at a time,</i>
<i>one moment at a time...</i>

10:48.439 --> 10:49.440
Stop...

10:49.523 --> 10:51.108
<i>...whether we want to or not.</i>

10:51.192 --> 10:52.193
It.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.569
<i>-And for that...</i>
-Stop it!

10:53.653 --> 10:58.491
<i>...we can thank our tireless friends</i>
<i>at the Time Variance Authority.</i>

10:58.616 --> 11:02.244
BROUSSARD: <i>There's an organization that</i>
<i>goes back in the history of Marvel Comics</i>

11:02.328 --> 11:04.664
<i>called the Time Variance Authority,</i>
<i>the TVA.</i>

11:04.789 --> 11:07.375
It's an organization that
I've long been fascinated with,

11:07.458 --> 11:09.794
just as I've paged through comics
at Marvel

11:09.877 --> 11:11.337
in the years that I've been there.

11:11.420 --> 11:15.383
<i>And I always knew that</i>
<i>they could have a very cool story to tell.</i>

11:15.466 --> 11:17.343
<i>The notion of this bureaucracy</i>

11:17.426 --> 11:20.137
<i>that basically controls</i>
<i>all of time and space.</i>

11:22.264 --> 11:23.265
-Come on.
-Let's go.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.059
You're making a terrible mistake.

11:25.434 --> 11:28.437
BROUSSARD: <i>He's the trickster,</i>
<i>and he's this prince of Asgard,</i>

11:28.521 --> 11:32.817
<i>this God of Mischief, who's had</i>
<i>this somewhat villainous role to play.</i>

11:32.900 --> 11:35.361
And we really just liked the idea
of plucking him,

11:35.444 --> 11:37.238
quite literally out of his own time

11:37.321 --> 11:40.199
<i>and throwing him down in a place</i>
<i>where he doesn't know the rules.</i>

11:40.282 --> 11:43.953
You see him first in his Avengers costume.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.080
<i>And so, that's this, you know,</i>

11:46.163 --> 11:50.209
<i>very elaborate</i>
<i>sort of fighting outfit, right?</i>

11:50.292 --> 11:51.794
Absolutely not.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.213
This is fine Asgardian leather.

11:54.296 --> 11:57.216
WADA: <i>So we wanted to just do</i>
<i>a real stark contrast.</i>

11:57.299 --> 11:59.885
<i>Just a very, like, open it up with a bang.</i>

12:01.846 --> 12:03.472
Now, hang on just a minute.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.474
MAN: Two... one... Action!

12:05.558 --> 12:06.600
(YELPS)

12:06.684 --> 12:07.685
(GASPS)

12:07.768 --> 12:11.731
HIDDLESTON: <i>We put him</i>
<i>in a standard-issue TVA jumpsuit</i>

12:11.814 --> 12:13.816
<i>and essentially, in that scene,</i>

12:13.899 --> 12:16.777
break him down
to his most vulnerable core.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.195
Please, through the door.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.365
Oh, right. So the floor can drop out
from under me as soon as I try to leave.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.492
Nice try. I'm ready for it this time.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.370
-That's not how this chamber works.
-Liar.

12:26.454 --> 12:30.374
You kind of wanted to give
a little insight into the character

12:30.458 --> 12:35.129
that wasn't just about the wall
of the superhero costume, right?

12:35.212 --> 12:36.672
<i>You wanted to feel like</i>

12:36.756 --> 12:40.217
<i>you were penetrating some layers</i>
<i>into this character.</i>

12:40.301 --> 12:43.053
You have no idea what I'm capable of!

12:43.137 --> 12:44.805
MOBIUS: I... I think I might.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.059
Have an idea of what he's capable of.

12:49.769 --> 12:53.022
I remember sitting down
with Kevin Wright, the producer,

12:53.105 --> 12:54.732
and some of the writers,

12:54.815 --> 12:57.943
and they were telling me the story
of the show. And they were like,

12:58.027 --> 13:01.405
"So, there's this really interesting
character called Mobius and, um,

13:01.489 --> 13:04.658
"he's kind of like
an analyst in the TVA.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.661
"And he's a great intellect,
and he's a scholar.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.955
"And he kind of understands Loki.

13:10.664 --> 13:13.042
"And he's able to
show him parts of himself

13:13.125 --> 13:15.753
"he's never understood before."

13:15.836 --> 13:19.131
And I always thought, "God,
I wonder who's gonna play that part?"

13:19.507 --> 13:21.300
-And here he is.
-Here he is.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.843
-The one and only.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

13:22.968 --> 13:24.470
Let me ask you this. How...

13:24.553 --> 13:26.931
Thought you were leading up to, like,

13:27.431 --> 13:29.350
"And there's only one person
in my mind..."

13:29.433 --> 13:31.185
-There's only...
-"...who could play this."

13:31.268 --> 13:32.478
There's only one person.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.231
-Instead it was, "Who is it gonna be?"
-It was only ever...

13:35.314 --> 13:36.357
"Here he is."

13:36.440 --> 13:37.525
(BOTH LAUGHING)

13:38.901 --> 13:42.154
OWEN WILSON: <i>Well, when they first</i>
<i>spoke to me about</i> Iron Man,

13:42.238 --> 13:45.366
<i>I kind of wanted to let Marvel</i>
<i>get established a little bit.</i>

13:45.449 --> 13:48.828
<i>And so then when they talked to me</i>
<i>about</i> Thor, <i>and then about...</i>

13:48.911 --> 13:51.956
<i>uh, </i>Captain America, <i>and even</i> Hulk,

13:52.039 --> 13:54.458
I was like,
"Well, you know, I don't know..."

13:54.542 --> 13:57.127
So, um, it... I'm just kidding.

13:57.503 --> 14:01.465
You know what's funny is, like,
even the name "Mobius," it's like...

14:01.549 --> 14:02.842
I just like that name.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.052
-It just is a cool...
-It's a great name. Yeah.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.221
So when people say,
"What are you doing?"

14:07.304 --> 14:11.684
And, you know, "What are you doing
in the Marvel Universe?"

14:11.767 --> 14:15.521
"No, I'm not wearing a cape.
I'm not... I don't have any superpowers.

14:15.604 --> 14:20.150
"Other than the name 'Mobius,'
which has a certain power to it."

14:20.234 --> 14:22.361
WALDRON: <i>In a story about anti-heroes,</i>

14:22.736 --> 14:26.448
<i>the exciting thing about Mobius</i>
<i>was to play a guy</i>

14:26.532 --> 14:31.620
who was really just kind of
a down-the-middle, old-school hero.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.330
Clock's always tickin'.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.460
Which is better than the alternative.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.963
WALDRON: <i>He's the rascally detective.</i>

14:41.046 --> 14:44.508
<i>And such a good foil for Tom.</i>

14:44.592 --> 14:46.093
How's training going?

14:46.176 --> 14:48.053
-Complete natural.
-Yeah?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.681
Learning about my jet ski there?

14:50.764 --> 14:54.977
WILSON: <i>It was great when I first</i>
<i>got down here to work in Atlanta</i>

14:55.060 --> 14:58.981
because Tom...
We sort of called them "The Loki Lectures"

14:59.064 --> 15:05.279
that Tom would take us through
and work with me individually.

15:05.362 --> 15:10.284
<i>Just going over the lore</i>
<i>and everything that he felt was important,</i>

15:10.367 --> 15:13.120
<i>and showing me clips and things.</i>

15:13.203 --> 15:18.208
<i>So that was really important to me</i>
<i>for understanding.</i>

15:18.292 --> 15:20.794
<i>And then also, I ended up just</i>
<i>sort of writing down</i>

15:20.878 --> 15:23.339
<i>some of the stuff he said describing Loki.</i>

15:23.422 --> 15:28.594
And I think that even worked its way
sometimes into dialogue that I would say.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.930
Glorious purpose.

15:31.513 --> 15:36.226
HIDDLESTON: <i>I remember Owen asking me</i>
<i>what I loved about playing Loki.</i>

15:36.310 --> 15:38.520
<i>Like, never mind what was great</i>
<i>about the character,</i>

15:38.604 --> 15:40.189
<i>what other people could see.</i>

15:40.272 --> 15:42.441
<i>He was like,</i>
<i>"Tom, what do you love about it?</i>

15:42.524 --> 15:44.276
<i>"What do you love about Loki?"</i>

15:44.360 --> 15:46.236
<i>And I heard myself saying,</i>

15:46.320 --> 15:49.239
"He plays all the keys on the piano.

15:50.157 --> 15:54.036
"So, he plays the light keys
and the major keys, all the...

15:54.119 --> 15:56.121
"All the light, white notes up there.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.416
"But he also plays the heavy keys
with the left hand.

15:59.500 --> 16:03.462
"Those deep, profound chords

16:03.545 --> 16:08.258
"which are full of sorrow, and grief,
and anger.

16:08.634 --> 16:12.888
"And he's able to somehow make it...

16:12.972 --> 16:18.227
"The music of Loki internally
has this breadth of the scale."

16:18.686 --> 16:22.982
Um, and Owen said,
"That sounds about right."

16:23.065 --> 16:24.274
Enough.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.445
Back in your cage.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.198
See, I can play the heavy keys, too.

16:31.949 --> 16:36.036
WILSON: <i>I had a nice conversation one day</i>
<i>where I was talking with Tom.</i>

16:36.120 --> 16:39.707
<i>And he quoted something, and I said,</i>
<i>"Is that Shakespeare?"</i>

16:39.790 --> 16:41.375
<i>And he said, "Yes,</i> Hamlet."

16:41.458 --> 16:44.628
<i>And I was proud just that</i>
<i>I got the Shakespeare part.</i>

16:44.712 --> 16:47.548
And then I said,
"Have you played <i>Hamlet?"</i>

16:47.631 --> 16:52.011
And he said, yes, he had.
That, in fact, Kenneth Branagh

16:52.094 --> 16:55.889
<i>directed him</i>
<i>in some performances of</i> Hamlet.

16:56.181 --> 17:00.144
<i>And he described what that was like</i>
<i>and how rewarding it was,</i>

17:00.227 --> 17:02.187
<i>and I was just listening.</i>

17:02.271 --> 17:07.151
And, um, when he finished, and this is,
I guess, that sort of English politeness,

17:07.276 --> 17:09.611
uh, there was a slight sort of pause.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.656
And then he said,
"Have you ever played <i>Hamlet?"</i>

17:12.740 --> 17:17.578
Uh, and it's the first time, uh,
that, uh...

17:17.661 --> 17:19.246
That someone I've worked with

17:19.329 --> 17:23.167
has ever even thought to ask me
if that was a possibility.

17:23.250 --> 17:27.463
Because I can't imagine
Ben Stiller ever having wondered,

17:27.546 --> 17:29.757
"God, has Owen ever played <i>Hamlet?"</i>

17:29.840 --> 17:31.925
If you had to do a Shakespeare play...

17:32.801 --> 17:34.344
what would you choose?

17:35.429 --> 17:37.973
<i>Two Gentlemen of Verona,</i> I think.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.517
(BOTH LAUGHING)

17:43.312 --> 17:44.605
Do you know it well?

17:44.688 --> 17:47.107
Tom almost was able to keep
a straight face.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.984
-By heart.
-That's when I felt like...

17:49.068 --> 17:52.696
When he was asking the question,
"Have you played <i>Hamlet?"</i>

17:52.780 --> 17:55.199
That's, like... He was just, like...

17:55.282 --> 17:57.159
Just being so polite about it.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.410
-But...
-You never know.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.329
-You could've played it at school...
-Yeah.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.747
...in a school production.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.957
-Yeah. What one could I...
-You know most of it.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.085
He knows most of <i>Hamlet.</i>
People don't know that.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.503
-You know it by heart.
-No.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.338
-That's not true.
-You know some of it.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.673
<i>-As You Like It?</i>
-"Cease to persuade, loving Proteus.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.176
"Home-keeping youth have ever homely wit."

18:14.259 --> 18:17.971
That's the first line
from <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona,</i> I think.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.099
Which, I don't know the play,

18:20.182 --> 18:24.144
but in college,
I took a Shakespeare class.

18:24.394 --> 18:28.107
Déjà vu. Yeah, time moves
a little differently here in the TVA.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.151
I think something that me and Owen
spoke about at the very beginning was

18:31.235 --> 18:33.487
he really wanted to, like,
get out of himself.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.949
<i>And I think a key thing for that</i>
<i>was the wig.</i>

18:37.032 --> 18:39.409
<i>Obviously, we wanted to keep</i>
<i>the moustache for Mobius</i>

18:39.493 --> 18:42.037
<i>'cause that's so key</i>
<i>to his character in the comics</i>

18:42.121 --> 18:44.039
<i>and the artist that he's based on.</i>

18:44.123 --> 18:46.625
You gonna keep this?
Or is this gonna stay in your life?

18:46.708 --> 18:49.503
Well, I've gotten a lot of compliments
on this moustache.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.381
-It's very dashing, I think.
-"Dashing" is the word that

18:52.464 --> 18:54.758
a lot of people have used.
So I might...

18:54.842 --> 18:56.301
-I can't afford...
-"Dapper."

18:56.385 --> 18:57.928
"Dapper." I don't think

18:58.011 --> 19:00.139
-I can afford to shave this.
-"Smart." Yep.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.807
-This might be from...
-"Fancy."

19:01.890 --> 19:05.519
From here on out when you see ol' OCW,

19:05.602 --> 19:08.313
you might... (LAUGHS)
see him with a mustache.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.899
WILSON: <i>I really like the whole look.</i>

19:10.983 --> 19:14.111
<i>And maybe it's a little bit sort of</i>
<i>like that feeling as a kid</i>

19:14.194 --> 19:15.654
<i>when you're kind of make believe.</i>

19:15.737 --> 19:17.906
Come on, gear up. There's been an attack.

19:19.741 --> 19:23.287
Well, that's why I like this hat,
because this feels a little bit like a...

19:23.370 --> 19:25.873
A gumshoe from kind of the '40s,

19:25.956 --> 19:29.376
which I feel like
this "TVA" is a bit like.

19:29.459 --> 19:33.881
WADA: <i>I just wanted him to look completely</i>
<i>like off-the-rack detective.</i>

19:33.964 --> 19:38.010
Almost as if he, you know,
just found his clothing

19:38.093 --> 19:40.012
through the lost and found at the TVA.

19:40.095 --> 19:43.557
"Insubordinate, stubborn, unpredictable."

19:44.224 --> 19:46.018
Sounds like someone else I know.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.312
I was just thinking
it sounds like someone I know.

19:48.395 --> 19:54.026
WALDRON: <i>We always had the Time-Keepers</i>
<i>as kind of this big, omnipotent threat,</i>

19:54.109 --> 19:57.112
<i>antagonistic force in the TVA.</i>

19:57.571 --> 19:59.948
<i>But as we were writing the series,</i>

20:00.032 --> 20:04.953
we realized we probably need
a more on-the-ground threat.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.956
<i>And that really took the form</i>
<i>of Judge Renslayer.</i>

20:08.040 --> 20:11.793
You ridiculous bureaucrats
will not dictate how my story ends!

20:11.877 --> 20:15.172
It's not your story, Mr. Laufeyson.
It never was.

20:28.518 --> 20:29.686
(WEAPONS CLICKING)

20:29.770 --> 20:32.356
I loved the dimensions of Renslayer.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.900
<i>I felt like people who know the comics</i>
<i>know who she is,</i>

20:34.983 --> 20:37.653
but she's never been interpreted before,
you know.

20:37.736 --> 20:41.573
So, there is a sense that
you are really getting to create her.

20:41.657 --> 20:45.160
<i>And I just love the depths that she has</i>
<i>and the layers that she has.</i>

20:45.244 --> 20:47.037
<i>And I think that she's powerful.</i>

20:47.120 --> 20:49.248
<i>She's well respected.</i>
<i>She's worked her way up.</i>

20:49.331 --> 20:50.332
There's our Variant.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.335
I don't think I've ever played
such an authoritative character.

-Chaos. Death.

Free will?

21:16.358 --> 21:19.069
Uh, and this is...
This is an incredible set.

right behind us,

I've bonded with the space. (CHUCKLES)

21:42.801 --> 21:47.222
WRIGHT:<i> We all just knew</i>
<i>we wanted to build sets.</i>

21:47.306 --> 21:54.271
The TVA just lent itself to a tactile,
real, grounded feeling.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.983
<i>You wanted to see the rings of coffee</i>
<i>on papers and desks.</i>

21:58.066 --> 22:00.986
<i>And like, to do that, you just...</i>
<i>You have to build the world.</i>

22:02.404 --> 22:05.574
For the record, this really does feel
like a killing-me kind of a room.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.535
HERRON: <i>You wanna have this kind of</i>
<i>Big-Brother-is-watching vibe</i>

22:08.618 --> 22:11.163
<i>with the TVA, that the Time-Keepers</i>
<i>are always watching.</i>

22:11.246 --> 22:13.957
<i>And it has this beautiful,</i>
<i>big statues of the Time-Keepers,</i>

22:14.041 --> 22:15.834
<i>'cause they are gods, essentially.</i>

22:15.917 --> 22:19.046
<i>But I love the idea of marrying that</i>
<i>with the </i>Mad Men<i> aesthetic,</i>

22:19.129 --> 22:22.090
<i>because, you know, we think that</i>
<i>they're good guys, and it's stylish.</i>

22:22.174 --> 22:23.675
MOBIUS: Home sweet home.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.138
I thought there was no magic here.

22:28.221 --> 22:29.473
There isn't.

22:29.973 --> 22:32.976
BROUSSARD: <i>We talked a lot about</i>
<i>fun sci-fi bureaucracies,</i>

22:33.060 --> 22:36.438
things like <i>Defending Your Life,</i>
or <i>Beetlejuice,</i>

22:36.521 --> 22:38.440
or Terry Gilliam's <i>Brazil.</i>

22:38.523 --> 22:42.486
They've all been great touchstones
for this massive organization

22:42.569 --> 22:46.573
<i>that feels kind of stuck in the past,</i>
<i>in that it's very analog...</i>

22:46.656 --> 22:49.409
<i>There's a lot of paper,</i>
<i>a lot of older machines.</i>

22:49.493 --> 22:53.246
<i>But also do this amazing, huge job</i>
<i>of controlling all of time, basically.</i>

22:53.330 --> 22:55.665
Is this the greatest power
in the universe?

22:55.749 --> 22:58.543
<i>Autumn, our director of photography,</i>
<i>is doing an amazing job.</i>

22:58.627 --> 23:01.505
<i>Painting with light</i>
<i>and making things feel very cinematic,</i>

23:01.588 --> 23:02.923
<i>very moody, and very cool.</i>

23:04.549 --> 23:06.385
Mischievous scamp.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.895
The world that the production
designers created

23:17.020 --> 23:20.649
and kind of Kate's come up with
is very unique for Loki,

23:20.732 --> 23:22.401
<i>and it has a lot of texture.</i>

23:22.484 --> 23:26.154
<i>And I like to kind of bring</i>
<i>that to the space</i>

23:26.238 --> 23:28.156
<i>with lighting and lens choice.</i>

23:28.240 --> 23:31.785
And, you know, I want it to
not be too sharp and too pristine,

23:31.868 --> 23:35.622
so it feels like it could
have been shot on 35.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.082
And that's important to me,

23:37.165 --> 23:39.584
and I think everyone
was kind of on board with that.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.753
Swinging for the fences!

23:41.837 --> 23:43.672
KASRA FARAHANI:
<i>The TVA is radically different</i>

23:43.755 --> 23:46.174
<i>than what we've seen so far in the MCU.</i>

23:46.258 --> 23:50.345
It's heavily kind of influenced
by mid-century Modernism and Brutalism,

23:50.429 --> 23:56.226
<i>with a strong dose</i>
<i>of Kafka-esque humor mixed into it</i>

23:56.309 --> 23:59.020
<i>and bureaucratic kind of chaos.</i>

23:59.104 --> 24:02.441
-Wish I could say I was surprised.
-Yeah, I wish you hadn't interrupted us.

24:02.524 --> 24:05.360
-Me? It's my fault?
-Look, he can't have gotten very far.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.528
HUNTER B-15: Split up!

24:06.611 --> 24:08.905
HIDDLESTON: <i>Some of the architecture</i>
<i>and the design are circular.</i>

24:08.989 --> 24:11.408
<i>I suppose it's the idea</i>
<i>of how we think of time.</i>

24:11.491 --> 24:13.285
<i>Time does exist in circles.</i>

24:13.368 --> 24:15.328
<i>Clocks and watches are circular.</i>

24:15.412 --> 24:17.581
<i>We talk of the years and the seasons.</i>

24:17.664 --> 24:21.126
We speak of seasonal cycles,
and we think of time as a kind of...

24:21.793 --> 24:23.670
<i>it's something that rolls along.</i>

24:23.753 --> 24:24.963
MINUTEMAN: Take a ticket.

24:25.046 --> 24:28.049
FARAHANI: <i>In some ways,</i>
<i>that is one of our simplest sets.</i>

24:28.133 --> 24:32.387
And yet it's a lot of people's favorite,
and it's sort of the funniest.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.098
<i>The idea is that</i>
<i>it's like a very oppressive,</i>

24:35.182 --> 24:37.225
<i>compressed but trash compactor box.</i>

24:37.309 --> 24:38.643
Standing in this room now,

24:38.727 --> 24:41.688
the ceiling is incredibly low,
and there are all these lights.

24:41.771 --> 24:45.233
It feels quite claustrophobic.
And you just wanna get out.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.235
FARAHANI: <i>The ceilings are 7'6''.</i>

24:47.319 --> 24:51.740
<i>Even in a pretty humble apartment,</i>
<i>you typically have 8-foot ceilings,</i>

24:51.823 --> 24:53.867
so there's six inches less headroom.

24:53.950 --> 24:56.161
So it feels like
it's kind of crushing down on you.

24:56.244 --> 24:59.164
<i>And then, obviously,</i>
<i>as you know, the ceiling is covered</i>

24:59.247 --> 25:03.502
<i>in this sea of illuminated</i>
<i>circles of white, reflected light.</i>

25:03.585 --> 25:05.295
<i>And inside of each circle,</i>

25:05.378 --> 25:09.591
<i>there is a bulb that has a chrome tip</i>
<i>at the bottom and shines light up.</i>

25:09.674 --> 25:13.512
<i>And so, if you look at it, it looks</i>
<i>like a sea of eyeballs, essentially.</i>

25:13.595 --> 25:18.642
<i>And, you know, there's all the stanchions</i>
<i>and the kind of nylon ropes</i>

25:18.725 --> 25:21.186
<i>that are corralling them like cattle,</i>

25:21.269 --> 25:24.523
<i>immediately stripping them</i>
<i>of any kind of free will.</i>

25:24.606 --> 25:26.733
MISS MINUTES: <i>Thanks for visiting the TVA.</i>

25:26.816 --> 25:29.027
<i>Don't hesitate</i>
<i>to let us know how we're doin'.</i>

25:29.611 --> 25:33.240
HERRON: <i>We interestingly have a lot</i>
<i>of hierarchy across the whole story.</i>

25:33.323 --> 25:38.828
<i>Like the TVA, in its design, for example,</i>
<i>you have Minutemen, Analysts, then Judges.</i>

25:38.912 --> 25:40.830
But that's reflected
in the design of the TVA.

25:40.914 --> 25:43.500
We have these kind of
<i>Shining</i> Overlook-style corridors

25:43.583 --> 25:45.043
that are endless and go on forever.

25:45.126 --> 25:48.421
<i>But we have the security level,</i>
<i>and the management office level,</i>

25:48.505 --> 25:50.298
<i>and then the level where Renslayer is.</i>

25:50.382 --> 25:53.051
<i>And I think that</i>
<i>that was really key as well,</i>

25:53.134 --> 25:56.972
<i>was making it clear that the TVA,</i>
<i>even in the design and the architecture,</i>

25:57.055 --> 25:58.765
<i>had this kind of feeling of hierarchy.</i>

25:58.848 --> 26:04.396
We really worked hard to develop
class systems in this show.

26:04.479 --> 26:06.565
<i>So we just created</i>
<i>all this different ranking.</i>

26:06.648 --> 26:10.569
<i>So basically, the Hunters</i>
<i>have solid black uniforms.</i>

26:10.652 --> 26:13.863
<i>All the Minutemen,</i>
<i>all the sort of enlisted, have,</i>

26:13.947 --> 26:15.615
<i>what I call the harlequin pattern,</i>

26:15.699 --> 26:19.619
<i>where everybody's, from side to side,</i>
<i>it's a contrasting panel,</i>

26:19.703 --> 26:21.788
<i>and it switches around on each person.</i>

26:21.871 --> 26:25.709
So sometimes one panel
is lighter on the right side.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.836
On the other person,
it's light on the left side.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.546
On an another,
it's light on the front.

26:29.629 --> 26:32.424
So that it played
with the concept of time and space.

26:32.507 --> 26:35.760
If you see a Loki, prune it.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.180
The bad Loki, preferably.

26:39.264 --> 26:43.852
WADA: <i>It is kind of meant to feel</i>
<i>that this organization</i>

26:43.935 --> 26:46.771
sort of strips you of your individuality.

26:46.855 --> 26:50.567
<i>And the only things</i>
<i>that I did do were scarring marks.</i>

26:50.650 --> 26:56.740
<i>Like B-15 has the amount of kills</i>
<i>she's scratched in numbers on her helmet.</i>

26:57.907 --> 27:01.286
She's a badass.
She's proficient physically.

27:01.369 --> 27:05.457
<i>And, um, she's strong.</i>
<i>She's dedicated and loyal.</i>

27:05.540 --> 27:07.334
Your Loki jumped me.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.294
I told you he wasn't to be trusted.

27:09.377 --> 27:12.505
When we were casting,
Wunmi came in, and it was just like,

27:12.589 --> 27:14.507
<i>"This is it.</i>
<i>This is the character."</i>

27:14.591 --> 27:17.052
We talked a lot about religion and faith.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.638
<i>And when people have crisis of faith or</i>

27:19.721 --> 27:24.643
<i>like an epiphany or an awakening</i>
<i>and everything changes.</i>

27:25.352 --> 27:26.394
I looked happy.

27:29.522 --> 27:30.523
What now?

27:30.607 --> 27:35.153
She brings this warmth to the character,
but then she is our most badass.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.405
<i>Honestly, she's like</i>
<i>an action hero, right?</i>

27:37.489 --> 27:39.366
<i>It was such an exciting</i>
<i>moment to be, like,</i>

27:39.449 --> 27:42.202
bring this really awesome
woman to the MCU.

27:45.205 --> 27:50.251
I really was excited about doing
the stunts and doing all of that stuff

27:50.335 --> 27:52.587
'cause I've never really
done that stuff before.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.798
<i>A huge part of it</i>
<i>was just being comfortable</i>

27:54.881 --> 27:56.758
<i>with a weapon like the Time Stick,</i>

27:56.841 --> 28:00.428
<i>where you turn it on, and you snap it open</i>
<i>and twist it, and the light goes on.</i>

28:00.512 --> 28:03.181
<i>It's orange when you want</i>
<i>to prune something.</i>

28:03.264 --> 28:04.307
CASEY: You almost hit me!

28:04.391 --> 28:06.476
MOSAKU:<i> And then we have</i>
<i>the TemPad, which,</i>

28:06.559 --> 28:08.770
it looks like a mobile phone,
a gold mobile phone.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.772
And you can call up a Time Door.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.107
So that's what we'd use

28:12.190 --> 28:15.568
<i>to get to the new branch</i>
<i>and back to the TVA.</i>

28:15.652 --> 28:19.823
LUKE MCDONALD: <i>The technology that</i>
<i>they're using needs to feel like it's not,</i>

28:19.906 --> 28:22.534
<i>it's not futuristic, but it's not archaic.</i>

28:22.617 --> 28:28.623
It needs to be this kind of
ethereal place in time.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.959
<i>Because the way</i>
<i>that it was written and described</i>

28:31.042 --> 28:35.839
<i>in the script from the writers</i>
<i>was that it was a glassy time door,</i>

28:35.922 --> 28:38.883
<i>it instantly kind of started</i>
<i>to all click into place.</i>

28:39.259 --> 28:40.260
Sir...

28:40.385 --> 28:42.971
MCDONALD: <i>And one of the things</i>
<i>that really inspired us</i>

28:43.054 --> 28:46.015
<i>for the Time Doors was David Lynch's </i>Dune,

28:46.099 --> 28:48.393
<i>when they're practice fighting,</i>

28:48.476 --> 28:50.645
<i>and they have these</i>
<i>kind of shields over them.</i>

28:50.729 --> 28:54.232
<i>And we did a camera test shoot,</i>
<i>and we shot an element.</i>

28:54.315 --> 28:58.820
<i>And instantly I jumped into</i>
<i>literally lookdeving this element out.</i>

28:58.903 --> 29:03.992
<i>And we lookdeved out probably</i>
<i>a good 150 different designs</i>

29:04.075 --> 29:07.829
<i>before we landed on something</i>
<i>that everyone really liked.</i>

29:16.379 --> 29:17.881
Fancy technology.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.925
Threatening interrogation tactics.

29:22.552 --> 29:25.138
Seems you and I are in a loop of our own.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.895
Yeah, the Time Theater's
where we really broke the back of this,

29:31.978 --> 29:33.396
the early part of our shoot.

29:33.480 --> 29:37.859
<i>And there's such a huge and hugely</i>
<i>important scene that takes place in it.</i>

29:37.942 --> 29:39.736
Do you enjoy hurting people?

29:39.819 --> 29:41.029
It's a simple question.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.489
Do you enjoy killing?

29:42.572 --> 29:43.698
LOKI: I'll kill you.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.283
What, like you killed your mother?

29:45.366 --> 29:47.076
He and Mobius in the Time Theater,

29:47.160 --> 29:50.705
it's two people talking
for 30 pages about identity

29:50.789 --> 29:53.333
<i>and philosophy,</i>
<i>and life, and it's thrilling.</i>

29:54.417 --> 29:56.377
I can't believe you were D.B. Cooper.

29:57.128 --> 29:59.130
I was young, and I lost a bet to Thor.

29:59.214 --> 30:02.091
Obviously, when you're working
on a Marvel production,

30:02.175 --> 30:04.969
there's a lot of secrecy, right?
So not everyone has a script.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.846
<i>And I remember filming</i>
<i>on the Time Theater,</i>

30:06.930 --> 30:09.808
<i>Owen and Tom are looking at a stage,</i>
<i>but there's nothing on it.</i>

30:09.891 --> 30:13.228
So, the stage is paused
on the Avengers on stage.

30:14.229 --> 30:18.733
And then Loki gets up.
He sets down the Time Disk.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.069
Me and the editors
have kind of cut together, like,

30:21.152 --> 30:24.656
"Okay, we think this is a good
moment to play, or this moment."

30:24.739 --> 30:27.575
Let's go from the top of that clip,
just so we get the timing on it.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.369
MAN: All right. Let's reset.
Let's shoot it.

30:29.452 --> 30:31.704
HERRON: <i>There were points</i>
<i>where the crew were like,</i>

30:31.788 --> 30:35.917
<i>"Okay. This is two guys in a room,</i>
<i>and they're looking at a wall.</i>

30:36.543 --> 30:40.046
"And Kate and Tom seem
to have a groove for what's going on."

30:40.129 --> 30:42.799
'Cause I'd say, "Now it's <i>Dark World.</i>
Or now it's <i>Avengers."</i>

30:42.882 --> 30:45.802
So, I've gone back
to the same clip of Mum dying.

30:47.053 --> 30:50.306
This is where the reaction
goes on my own now.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.433
HERRON: <i>What was really</i>
<i>beautiful about it was that,</i>

30:52.517 --> 30:55.103
<i>filming that,</i>
<i>some of the crew were probably, like,</i>

30:55.186 --> 30:56.437
<i>"Okay, this is very strange."</i>

30:56.521 --> 30:59.482
<i>But they still threw</i>
<i>their heart and souls into it.</i>

30:59.566 --> 31:03.152
<i>And I think it was a real unifying moment</i>
<i>for everyone.</i>

31:03.236 --> 31:06.489
<i>And also, beyond that, just seeing</i>
<i>Owen and Tom's chemistry on screen.</i>

31:06.573 --> 31:08.283
<i>It was incredible.</i>

31:08.366 --> 31:10.785
<i>And, like, it kind of began</i>
<i>this chess match</i>

31:10.869 --> 31:13.663
<i>that both those characters really play</i>
<i>across the whole show.</i>

31:13.746 --> 31:16.499
A fugitive Variant's
been killing our Minutemen.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.962
And you need the God of Mischief
to help you stop him?

31:21.254 --> 31:22.463
That's right.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.215
Why me?

31:24.757 --> 31:26.718
The Variant we're hunting is...

31:27.385 --> 31:28.469
you.

31:30.513 --> 31:31.514
I beg your pardon?

31:33.099 --> 31:36.060
HIDDLESTON:
<i>"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."</i>

31:36.561 --> 31:40.106
<i>And Loki is, by far, his own worst enemy.</i>

31:40.189 --> 31:43.860
<i>In the 11 years of playing him,</i>
<i>over six films,</i>

31:43.943 --> 31:46.821
<i>spanning 13 hours and 50 minutes,</i>

31:46.905 --> 31:49.532
<i>he has fought his brother and his father,</i>

31:49.949 --> 31:54.329
<i>Frost Giants and Elves,</i>
<i>Avengers and Titans.</i>

31:55.121 --> 31:57.707
<i>But I can say with complete certainty</i>

31:57.790 --> 32:02.795
<i>that Loki's biggest battle</i>
<i>has always been within himself...</i>

32:03.922 --> 32:05.340
<i>...until now.</i>

32:07.717 --> 32:12.555
If this show was about
Loki learning to love himself,

32:12.639 --> 32:17.268
<i>a key way to help him arc and learn</i>
<i>to overcome those things</i>

32:17.352 --> 32:19.145
<i>is to have somebody that's gonna come in</i>

32:19.228 --> 32:21.356
<i>and challenge those views</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

32:21.439 --> 32:23.191
This isn't about you.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.275
Right.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.570
BROUSSARD:<i> Sophia plays a character</i>
<i>in the comics</i>

32:27.654 --> 32:30.698
<i>that was known as Sylvie Lus</i><i>hton.</i>
<i>She was an apprentice of Loki's</i>

32:30.782 --> 32:34.327
<i>and sort of someone that</i>
<i>he groomed to be a great sorcerer.</i>

32:34.410 --> 32:40.458
Our version in the show is basically
another version of Loki himself.

32:40.833 --> 32:41.960
What are you doing?

32:42.043 --> 32:43.044
What are you doing?

32:44.295 --> 32:46.255
-You trying to enchant me?
-No.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.508
-It won't work.
-Why? Because you're a magician?

32:48.591 --> 32:50.468
No, because my mind is too strong.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.346
SOPHIA DI MARTINO: <i>What really</i>
<i>intrigued me about the story was that</i>

32:53.429 --> 32:56.933
<i>this was a female variant of Loki</i>
<i>who was a lot more in line</i>

32:57.016 --> 32:59.477
<i>with The Enchantress character</i>
<i>that we know from the comics,</i>

32:59.560 --> 33:02.397
<i>but also, in a sense, a complete</i>
<i>re-imagining of The Enchantress.</i>

33:02.480 --> 33:04.774
<i>I thought there was something</i>
<i>interesting in that.</i>

33:04.857 --> 33:07.193
<i>Like, taking these two kind of</i>
<i>identities of Loki</i>

33:07.276 --> 33:08.569
<i>but doing something different.</i>

33:08.653 --> 33:10.363
-Keep it together.
-It's gonna be fine.

33:10.446 --> 33:16.911
She's another version of him
in the unlimited universes (CHUCKLES)

33:17.620 --> 33:21.249
<i>um, that are around.</i>
<i>And there are many versions of Loki.</i>

33:21.332 --> 33:22.959
<i>So her nexus event</i>

33:23.042 --> 33:27.255
<i>pulled her away</i>
<i>from her Loki life in Asgard,</i>

33:27.338 --> 33:31.342
<i>and so she's been living</i>
<i>a parallel life the whole time.</i>

33:31.426 --> 33:33.302
And it hasn't been great for Sylvie.

33:33.761 --> 33:36.431
(SCREAMING)

33:37.932 --> 33:42.103
WADA: <i>We still needed cues</i>
<i>to her being a Loki.</i>

33:42.186 --> 33:46.399
<i>But she needed to feel armored in a more</i>
<i>lost-and-found sort of way as well.</i>

33:46.482 --> 33:51.696
Sort of as if she was picking up pieces
along the way in her hideout.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.948
<i>It's as if Sylvie needed to feel</i>

33:54.032 --> 33:57.368
<i>as though she was trying to recede</i>
<i>into these worlds a little bit,</i>

33:57.452 --> 34:00.371
<i>but also be badass, tough, and armored.</i>

34:00.455 --> 34:02.206
DI MARTINO: <i>They've borrowed things</i>
<i>from Loki.</i>

34:02.290 --> 34:05.251
<i>Sort of the gold shape around the neck,</i>

34:05.877 --> 34:08.421
<i>and the leather, and the cape.</i>

34:09.088 --> 34:11.132
<i>The green circles on...</i>

34:11.215 --> 34:14.177
On the arms are...
The green is for Loki, obviously.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.554
And there's little bits of Enchantress
there as well.

34:16.637 --> 34:19.348
<i>We really wanted it to be super practical.</i>

34:19.432 --> 34:23.186
<i>Something that you can fight in</i>
<i>and that Sylvie could be on the run in,</i>

34:23.269 --> 34:25.480
rather than high heels and a leotard.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.777
(YELLS)

34:32.236 --> 34:33.905
DI MARTINO: <i>Such a gift of a character.</i>

34:33.988 --> 34:37.992
I get to just be this absolute badass
who's really angry,

34:38.076 --> 34:40.620
<i>and fight all of these guys.</i>

34:44.165 --> 34:45.583
HERRON: <i>Something that was really fun</i>

34:45.666 --> 34:47.752
<i>in looking at Sylvie</i>
<i>and her fighting style</i>

34:47.835 --> 34:49.962
and looking at these little
differences between her,

34:50.046 --> 34:51.756
you know, being a female version of Loki,

34:51.839 --> 34:53.049
<i>what makes her different?</i>

34:53.132 --> 34:54.801
<i>And it's the nature and nurture.</i>

34:54.884 --> 34:56.135
TRAINER: Bam. Push down.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.138
HERRON: <i>Loki grew up in a palace,</i>
<i>and he's very balletic, the way he fights.</i>

34:59.222 --> 35:00.848
<i>It's very graceful and very beautiful.</i>

35:00.932 --> 35:05.311
<i>Whereas Sylvie, she's had to be on the run</i>
<i>and live and grow up in an apocalypse.</i>

35:05.394 --> 35:08.523
So, I always think of her a bit
like a feral cat, the way she fights.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.525
You almost expect her to bite someone.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.485
<i>You see her at some point</i>
<i>take off her horns</i>

35:12.568 --> 35:13.945
<i>and put them in someone's face.</i>

35:14.028 --> 35:17.365
<i>Whereas Loki,</i>
<i>it's very, like, big arm movements.</i>

35:19.158 --> 35:22.870
Loki has this matador style of fighting,

35:22.954 --> 35:27.458
where everything is about a kind of
elegance and a kind of showmanship.

35:27.542 --> 35:28.918
MAN: And fight!

35:29.001 --> 35:30.711
(ALL GRUNTING)

35:32.130 --> 35:34.715
HIDDLESTON: <i>We're actually trying</i>
<i>to build on everything I've done,</i>

35:34.799 --> 35:38.219
<i>but make it even more graceful, I suppose.</i>
<i>If I can.</i>

35:38.302 --> 35:40.763
It's another mechanism for story.
It's very cool.

35:46.477 --> 35:48.354
-Hey! There it is.
-(LAUGHING)

35:48.855 --> 35:51.607
Once you take away
all the action and spectacle,

35:51.691 --> 35:53.317
our story is about identity

35:53.401 --> 35:55.403
<i>and someone finding their place</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

35:55.486 --> 35:57.446
-You're not a serious man.
-You're right. I'm a god.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.573
You're a clown.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.408
HERRON: <i>In Episode Three, in Shuroo,</i>

36:00.491 --> 36:03.244
<i>this is a really big moment</i>
<i>for Loki and Sylvie in their journey.</i>

36:03.327 --> 36:05.121
<i>They're actually working as a team.</i>

36:05.204 --> 36:07.456
We have to get on that ark
and make sure it takes off.

36:07.540 --> 36:08.666
How?

36:09.417 --> 36:10.501
We go around.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.753
HIDDLESTON: <i>Loki and Sylvie</i>
<i>have to run through this town,</i>

36:12.837 --> 36:14.380
<i>and the stakes are very high.</i>

36:14.463 --> 36:19.343
And the scene has to have an enormous
amount of momentum and propulsive energy.

36:19.427 --> 36:22.471
And Kasra built a town.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.391
<i>He just built the town on the backlot.</i>

36:27.143 --> 36:29.896
WRIGHT: <i>Shuroo was a set and a set piece</i>

36:29.979 --> 36:33.441
<i>that from the early days,</i>
<i>we planted the flag and said,</i>

36:33.524 --> 36:35.526
"This is what it's going to be.

36:35.610 --> 36:38.529
"And we want it to be big.
We want it to be practical.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.157
<i>"They need to be able</i>
<i>to run through this city.</i>

36:41.240 --> 36:43.117
<i>"We have to build the city."</i>

36:43.784 --> 36:45.620
Shuroo, where we are now,

36:45.703 --> 36:50.499
<i>has some of the archetypical</i>
<i>visual elements of a frontier town,</i>

36:50.583 --> 36:54.378
<i>but has some elements</i>
<i>that are completely different,</i>

36:54.462 --> 36:56.130
<i>from what we've seen on Earth</i>

36:56.214 --> 36:58.633
<i>and completely different</i>
<i>from any other alien worlds</i>

36:58.716 --> 37:01.469
<i>that have been established</i>
<i>so far in the MCU.</i>

37:01.552 --> 37:06.140
The scenes are all at night,
and you gotta check it out at night.

37:06.224 --> 37:10.019
<i>There's a lot of black light paint,</i>
<i>so the finishes, as you see them now,</i>

37:10.102 --> 37:12.939
<i>are quite different than</i>
<i>where they actually end up being.</i>

37:13.022 --> 37:16.901
<i>There's a quality where the architecture</i>
<i>itself becomes light sources</i>

37:16.984 --> 37:19.612
<i>because there's these elaborate,</i>
<i>painted patterns</i>

37:19.695 --> 37:22.740
<i>that are interactive with light on them.</i>

37:22.823 --> 37:25.993
<i>And so, it's almost, like,</i>
<i>floating, glowing patterns.</i>

37:26.077 --> 37:27.453
SYLVIE: Do we trust each other?

37:27.536 --> 37:29.580
LOKI: We do and you can.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.207
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

37:31.332 --> 37:32.333
SYLVIE: Good.

37:32.458 --> 37:36.754
So, we walk up,
we walk through this tunnel

37:36.837 --> 37:40.716
and into the city of Shuroo. Follow me.

37:44.804 --> 37:47.348
Ta-da! (CHUCKLES)

37:47.431 --> 37:49.725
Which is, I have to say,

37:50.351 --> 37:54.188
the most amazing... One of the most
amazing sets I have ever been on.

37:55.189 --> 37:58.985
I mean, it's been...
This has all been built on the backlot,

37:59.068 --> 38:00.987
here in Atlanta at the studios.

38:01.070 --> 38:05.157
Uh, it's all been lit and painted
so that it glows in the dark.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.076
Uh, it didn't exist before.

38:07.159 --> 38:09.870
And even on a Marvel project,

38:09.954 --> 38:12.415
I've never been on a set this size,
I don't think.

38:12.498 --> 38:15.835
FARAHANI: <i>The scene here is being shot</i>
<i>as a oner.</i>

38:15.918 --> 38:18.629
<i>And so what's required to do that</i>

38:18.713 --> 38:22.883
is essentially a set
that is 360 degrees photographable.

38:22.967 --> 38:27.263
<i>So, every surface has to be designed,</i>
<i>and built, and set decked.</i>

38:27.346 --> 38:30.933
<i>Big part of it was not building</i>
<i>any more set than we need.</i>

38:31.017 --> 38:33.936
<i>It's really doing a lot of planning</i>
<i>in the early phases.</i>

38:34.020 --> 38:36.314
<i>Kate worked with previz</i>
<i>and storyboards quite a lot</i>

38:36.397 --> 38:38.983
<i>to figure out exactly how much we needed.</i>

38:39.066 --> 38:43.321
<i>So that was a huge part to making sure</i>
<i>the resources were utilized well.</i>

38:43.404 --> 38:45.990
Kate and I have probably been
working on this for about a year

38:46.073 --> 38:47.700
when we first met,

38:47.783 --> 38:50.494
and started our prep in Los Angeles
at Disney.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.413
<i>There are cuts in our sequence,</i>

38:52.496 --> 38:55.499
<i>but we wanted the audience</i>
<i>to feel like it's one shot.</i>

38:55.583 --> 38:59.879
<i>So, we have stitches that transition us</i>
<i>from one shot to the other.</i>

38:59.962 --> 39:02.506
But the way that we filmed them,
we hide them

39:02.590 --> 39:04.342
so that they feel seamless,

39:04.425 --> 39:07.011
so you feel like it's one shot
from start to finish.

39:09.096 --> 39:13.309
I think it will be eight or nine
sort of stitches in the oner.

39:13.392 --> 39:15.895
But essentially,
we come through this thing.

39:15.978 --> 39:17.396
And behind me, you see...

39:17.480 --> 39:21.734
In the show, you see
this enormous crowd of people.

39:21.817 --> 39:25.863
And at the very, very end of this street,
up in the night sky,

39:26.113 --> 39:29.241
<i>is the docking point for this ark,</i>

39:29.325 --> 39:32.119
<i>this ship that is potentially leaving.</i>

39:32.703 --> 39:35.164
<i>And these meteors</i>
<i>are crashing into the buildings,</i>

39:35.247 --> 39:38.000
and the buildings are falling down,
and it's mayhem.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.127
People are running and screaming,

39:40.211 --> 39:42.338
and trying to get on the ark.

39:42.421 --> 39:45.674
<i>And there are guards</i>
<i>who are trying to stop them.</i>

39:45.758 --> 39:47.885
<i>So, to have the two of us,</i>
<i>to have Loki and Sylvie,</i>

39:47.968 --> 39:49.804
<i>myself and Sophia,</i>
<i>have to get through this,</i>

39:49.887 --> 39:52.556
<i>just creates an extraordinary,</i>
<i>dynamic momentum.</i>

39:52.640 --> 39:57.228
<i>And it's so exciting that at the moment</i>
<i>that Loki and Sylvie actually connect,</i>

39:57.311 --> 40:00.689
that it finishes at the end
of this extraordinary piece of action.

40:08.781 --> 40:11.492
Do you think that what makes a Loki a Loki

40:11.951 --> 40:14.578
is the fact that we're destined to lose?

40:15.037 --> 40:16.247
LOKI: No.

40:16.872 --> 40:18.374
We may lose.

40:20.292 --> 40:21.961
Sometimes painfully.

40:24.046 --> 40:25.506
But we don't die.

40:25.965 --> 40:29.093
One of the writers in our writers' room,
Elissa Karasik,

40:29.176 --> 40:31.846
she came in with a real strong POV

40:31.929 --> 40:34.014
<i>that it should run</i>
<i>at that love-story thing.</i>

40:34.098 --> 40:38.936
<i>And it was something the whole</i>
<i>writers' room got behind from day one.</i>

40:39.019 --> 40:40.104
Not bad.

40:41.147 --> 40:45.401
You know, it's so chaotic to fall in love
with a version of yourself,

40:45.484 --> 40:49.113
but at the same time,
it's such a bad idea and so mischievous,

40:49.196 --> 40:51.657
<i>it's, like, of course</i>
<i>Loki would fall in love with himself.</i>

40:51.740 --> 40:53.451
<i>But he's also a character that,</i>

40:53.534 --> 40:57.705
<i>I think, needs to, you know,</i>
<i>get past his demons</i>

40:57.788 --> 41:01.542
<i>and find the good within himself to be</i>
<i>able to go on that redemptive journey.</i>

41:01.625 --> 41:03.961
So at the heart of it,
it is this love story,

41:04.044 --> 41:06.005
<i>and you never fall in love</i>
<i>at the right time.</i>

41:06.088 --> 41:07.381
<i>The nice thing about it is that</i>

41:07.465 --> 41:10.301
<i>Crater Lake is where these two characters</i>
<i>really come together,</i>

41:10.384 --> 41:13.137
<i>and they realize there's something deeper</i>
<i>going on here.</i>

41:13.888 --> 41:17.099
HIDDLESTON: <i>You know, in life,</i>
<i>we all go through struggles,</i>

41:17.183 --> 41:18.851
<i>but we can't do it alone.</i>

41:18.934 --> 41:21.187
And if we have people we can trust,

41:21.270 --> 41:25.065
it lightens the load,
and it gladdens the heart.

41:25.149 --> 41:29.111
<i>And I think the relationship between</i>
<i>Loki and Sylvie is about that connection.</i>

41:29.195 --> 41:33.199
<i>That they learn, each of them,</i>
<i>to care about the other.</i>

41:34.366 --> 41:38.287
What a incredible seismic narcissist.

41:38.370 --> 41:40.039
You fell for yourself.

41:40.122 --> 41:41.665
Her name was Sylvie.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.542
Ah, Sylvie.

41:44.084 --> 41:48.714
Lovely. How do you spell that?
Is that with an I-E or just an I?

41:48.797 --> 41:50.090
Is she alive?

41:52.343 --> 41:53.344
For now.

41:56.597 --> 42:00.017
HIDDLESTON: <i>People in love</i>
<i>often speak of time stopping</i>

42:00.100 --> 42:03.771
<i>when they first catch</i>
<i>that jolting glance of their paramours,</i>

42:04.688 --> 42:08.359
<i>as if our brain,</i>
<i>perhaps even the universe, is telling us,</i>

42:08.692 --> 42:11.278
<i>"Your life is forever changed."</i>

42:12.321 --> 42:14.156
<i>"Sear this moment into your memory."</i>

42:16.825 --> 42:19.703
<i>So much is forgotten</i>
<i>and discarded every day.</i>

42:19.787 --> 42:22.164
<i>A password, an acquaintance's name.</i>

42:22.873 --> 42:26.752
<i>Our inability to control what stays</i>
<i>and what goes</i>

42:26.835 --> 42:30.381
<i>is a constant reminder</i>
<i>of the fallibility of the human mind.</i>

42:30.965 --> 42:34.843
<i>Objects in the rear view</i>
<i>are often much smaller than they appear,</i>

42:34.927 --> 42:37.721
<i>and they get smaller and smaller each day.</i>

42:38.931 --> 42:40.891
<i>But as we march forever onward,</i>

42:40.975 --> 42:45.646
<i>we will inevitably arrive</i>
<i>at one of those defining moments</i>

42:45.729 --> 42:49.608
<i>where clarity arrives,</i>
<i>followed quickly by more uncertainty.</i>

42:50.150 --> 42:54.530
<i>What we do in this moment</i>
<i>can often define our lives</i>

42:54.613 --> 42:56.365
<i>in ways we never dreamed of.</i>

42:56.448 --> 42:57.533
What is it?

42:57.616 --> 42:59.243
(GASPS)

43:02.997 --> 43:06.959
DI MARTINO:
<i>Sylvie finally gets to the Time-Keepers.</i>

43:07.042 --> 43:09.795
And then she finds herself
in a fight with Renslayer.

43:10.754 --> 43:12.172
<i>That was a really fun scene.</i>

43:12.715 --> 43:17.386
It's like, "Oh, wow!
This woman can fight. Ah!"

43:17.469 --> 43:19.722
"Sugar. Maybe I've met my match here."

43:19.805 --> 43:22.766
This time I finish the job.

43:26.562 --> 43:29.773
It's really the first time that
we get to see them both together.

43:29.857 --> 43:31.650
They have such different styles, I think,

43:31.734 --> 43:35.279
<i>because Renslayer came up</i>
<i>from the military background as a Hunter,</i>

43:35.362 --> 43:39.325
<i>and Sylvie really did</i>
<i>have this street-wise fighting style.</i>

43:41.744 --> 43:44.705
DI MARTINO: <i>The stunt team and</i>
<i>the fight team are really careful as well</i>

43:44.788 --> 43:48.459
about making sure the fights
make sense with the story.

43:48.542 --> 43:51.045
<i>And we make sure that the...</i>

43:51.128 --> 43:55.591
<i>The scenes work as scenes</i>
<i>without any fighting</i>

43:55.674 --> 43:57.718
<i>and then, sort of add the fighting in.</i>

43:57.801 --> 43:59.720
MBATHA-RAW: I think it does make sense
to go back.

43:59.803 --> 44:01.680
-Yeah.
-Even though it's less aggressive,

44:01.764 --> 44:03.140
-but she's coming forward.
-Yeah.

44:03.223 --> 44:04.516
-Also...
-MAN: Keep the counter step.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.060
-It's a good counter step.
-Yeah.

44:06.143 --> 44:08.354
In a musical, you sing

44:08.812 --> 44:12.066
when you don't have the words to express
how you feel anymore.

44:12.149 --> 44:14.068
When you get to that point,
you start singing.

44:14.151 --> 44:18.113
<i>With this, it's like, when you don't have</i>
<i>the words to express how you feel anymore,</i>

44:18.197 --> 44:19.406
<i>we fight.</i>

44:24.161 --> 44:27.790
MBATHA-RAW: <i>For Renslayer, it's kind of</i>
<i>a fascinating arc to go from</i>

44:27.873 --> 44:32.002
this very, very sort of straight
perception of the world that she has

44:32.086 --> 44:34.713
to it sort of all crumbling
before her eyes.

44:34.797 --> 44:39.885
SYLVIE: <i>Did Judge Renslayer really</i>
<i>feel betrayed by her beloved TVA?</i>

44:39.968 --> 44:43.681
Why don't you come back out
and we can talk about it?

44:49.061 --> 44:50.270
(WEAPON CLANGING)

44:54.441 --> 44:56.777
HERRON: <i>When I pitched The Void,</i>
<i>my thought was it's meant to be</i>

44:56.860 --> 45:00.322
<i>this barren wasteland where the TVA</i>
<i>sends everyone, and it's rubbish.</i>

45:00.406 --> 45:02.574
<i>It was so weird</i>
<i>'cause I was on set, obviously,</i>

45:02.658 --> 45:05.994
<i>and we're in this countryside.</i>
<i>And it's gray, and it's miserable.</i>

45:06.078 --> 45:08.455
And I was like,
"Oh, my God. I've pitched England."

45:08.539 --> 45:11.166
(LAUGHS)
But it really did remind me of it.

45:11.250 --> 45:14.420
It was quite strange. Quite a lot of
our cast and crew are British.

45:14.503 --> 45:16.380
We were like,
"Yeah, we feel like we're home."

45:21.635 --> 45:23.846
<i>What I really wanted to feel</i>
<i>in The Void was,</i>

45:23.929 --> 45:26.640
<i>it's this place where it's like</i>
<i>an overgrown garden.</i>

45:26.724 --> 45:30.060
<i>We have all these weird structures.</i>
<i>Like, we have a boat on land,</i>

45:30.144 --> 45:33.105
<i>and you see all these kind of</i>
<i>strange things that have been deleted</i>

45:33.188 --> 45:34.398
<i>that shouldn't exist in time.</i>

45:34.481 --> 45:36.066
<i>We had a lot of fun with Easter eggs</i>

45:36.150 --> 45:38.152
<i>and sprinkling in stuff</i>
<i>that shouldn't be there.</i>

45:38.235 --> 45:40.028
There's meant to be this kind of sadness

45:40.112 --> 45:42.364
and this kind of lack of life
about the place.

45:42.823 --> 45:45.576
HIDDLESTON: <i>But there are some things</i>
<i>in The Void</i>

45:45.659 --> 45:48.495
<i>which have learned to stay alive.</i>

45:48.579 --> 45:51.498
And they've managed
to make a life in The Void,

45:51.582 --> 45:54.251
if that's even possible. (CHUCKLES)

45:54.334 --> 45:56.795
And I can introduce you to them
if you like. (LAUGHS)

46:00.507 --> 46:03.177
RICHARD E. GRANT: <i>So when I got a call</i>
<i>to do it, I said, "Well, what is it?</i>

46:03.260 --> 46:07.681
"Is it to play an older version of Tom?"
That's what I assumed it was.

46:08.098 --> 46:09.767
They put it much more delicately.

46:09.850 --> 46:11.769
They said,
"No, you're playing Classic Loki."

46:14.396 --> 46:18.484
<i>So I said, "So it's in the green Lycra</i>
<i>bodysuit, with muscles."</i>

46:18.567 --> 46:20.861
They said, "No, you're not
gonna have the muscles."

46:20.944 --> 46:23.781
So I'm very distraught that,

46:23.864 --> 46:27.201
having had been born without any,
as you can see,

46:27.284 --> 46:28.994
that I thought I would finally...

46:29.077 --> 46:31.246
I would finally get to wear

46:31.330 --> 46:34.124
a green Lycra suit with built-in muscles.

46:34.666 --> 46:37.085
But that hasn't happened.
But I've got everything else.

46:37.169 --> 46:40.214
<i>The horns, and the cape,</i>
<i>and the, you know, the boots.</i>

46:40.297 --> 46:41.298
(LAUGHING)

46:41.423 --> 46:44.009
When I knew there was
gonna be this character,

46:44.092 --> 46:46.261
-there are, obviously, all these Lokis...
-Old.

46:46.345 --> 46:48.847
No, no. It wasn't just old. We literally,

46:48.931 --> 46:52.392
there's only one person we thought of.
And it was Richard.

46:52.476 --> 46:56.188
If we... If you'd said, "No," I don't know
what we would have done, really.

46:56.271 --> 46:58.190
-'Cause it'd be...
-You would've gone to...

46:58.273 --> 46:59.942
-No. No, no. It was...
-(LAUGHING)

47:00.025 --> 47:02.861
In fact, even in the concept art
when we were drawing it,

47:02.945 --> 47:05.656
<i>it was drawn with Richard's face.</i>
<i>It was like a wish fulfilment.</i>

47:05.739 --> 47:07.282
-Here we are, livin' the dream.
-Good.

47:07.366 --> 47:09.117
I'm livin' the dream. You may not be.

47:09.201 --> 47:10.786
-I am in the dream.
-You're saying that

47:10.869 --> 47:13.288
-'cause the cameras are rolling.
-I'm living in the dream.

47:13.372 --> 47:15.874
WADA: <i>Well, thank God that</i>
<i>Loki has a sense of humor.</i>

47:15.958 --> 47:18.544
And thank God that
the MCU has a sense of humor

47:18.627 --> 47:23.006
because it was just feeling like
you could go really

47:23.090 --> 47:25.259
<i>to all corners for inspiration.</i>

47:25.342 --> 47:29.972
In so many ways I kinda thought,
there's no acting required

47:30.055 --> 47:32.140
<i>because the costume does it.</i>

47:32.224 --> 47:35.352
<i>I mean, it's so massive, and I'm 6'6".</i>

47:35.435 --> 47:37.396
But then the boots that I have

47:37.479 --> 47:39.523
have, like, two inches on it, so I feel...

47:39.606 --> 47:41.441
I'm probably 6'8" in it already.

47:41.525 --> 47:43.068
And the shoulders are out here.

47:43.151 --> 47:47.239
I betrayed you, and now, I'm king.

47:47.781 --> 47:50.701
My army, my throne.

47:52.661 --> 47:55.581
HERRON: <i>Something from the comics</i>
<i>that I love about Loki is, like,</i>

47:55.664 --> 47:58.584
<i>he has been all these different</i>
<i>personalities, you know.</i>

47:58.667 --> 48:00.544
<i>In the early comics,</i>
<i>he was very villainous,</i>

48:00.627 --> 48:03.589
<i>but then you have the very different</i>
<i>Kid Loki in the later comics.</i>

48:04.172 --> 48:06.133
He's been like a unicorn.
He's been President.

48:06.216 --> 48:08.719
I feel like I'm having an identity crisis.

48:08.802 --> 48:11.096
WRIGHT: <i>It was fun. It was weird.</i>

48:11.179 --> 48:14.433
We were able to create
all of these bandit versions of Lokis.

48:15.183 --> 48:17.311
WADA: <i>They all got different nicknames.</i>

48:17.394 --> 48:22.691
<i>They were, like, Glamshades Wolfie,</i>
<i>which was kinda based originally of, like,</i>

48:22.774 --> 48:26.194
sort of a tribal leader. Like a shaman.

48:26.278 --> 48:27.863
<i>And we had Poky Loki.</i>

48:27.946 --> 48:32.284
<i>It was just another play</i>
<i>on In-Prison Loki. Bicycle Loki.</i>

48:32.367 --> 48:34.161
These are bicycle handlebars,

48:34.244 --> 48:36.246
which I think is very creative,

48:36.330 --> 48:40.334
and you could probably try to make,
to recreate at home, if you so choose.

48:40.417 --> 48:42.586
It was endless.

48:45.714 --> 48:47.925
Why the hell
is there an alligator in here?

48:48.008 --> 48:51.386
WRIGHT: <i>Alligator Loki is wholly invented</i>
<i>by Michael Waldron</i>

48:51.470 --> 48:53.597
in the first pitch
he ever came to us with.

48:53.680 --> 48:57.392
WALDRON:<i> I'll tell you, for every really</i>
<i>dumb idea like that that made it in,</i>

48:57.476 --> 49:01.355
there's a hundred even stupider ones
that these guys had to pull me back from.

49:01.438 --> 49:03.106
(GROWLING)

49:03.774 --> 49:07.277
That's alligator for growling
and saying "liar" at the same time.

49:07.361 --> 49:10.530
I remember sending a note
to the VFX team from our team,

49:10.614 --> 49:13.200
<i>which was basically like,</i>
<i>"We want to have an alligator</i>

49:13.283 --> 49:15.118
"that's very handsome
with beautiful eyes."

49:15.202 --> 49:16.745
And I was like, "What is this job?"
(LAUGHS)

49:16.828 --> 49:20.666
Alligator Loki was a very unique character
because of the fact that

49:20.749 --> 49:25.921
<i>sometimes the physics of a real alligator</i>
<i>are not taken into consideration.</i>

49:26.004 --> 49:28.423
Things like picking him up for instance.

49:28.507 --> 49:31.551
Well, picking up an alligator
is a very, very strange thing

49:31.635 --> 49:36.139
because alligators' spines
only kind of bend a certain way.

49:36.223 --> 49:39.226
<i>So we were working with ILM on this.</i>

49:39.309 --> 49:40.769
<i>They found a piece of reference</i>

49:40.852 --> 49:43.355
<i>that was one of the best references</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

49:43.438 --> 49:45.649
It's this alligator called Wally,

49:45.732 --> 49:47.818
and he is a support alligator.

49:47.901 --> 49:51.655
<i>He's absolutely amazing.</i>
<i>So we used this reference</i>

49:51.738 --> 49:56.326
<i>to make our alligator, based off</i>
<i>of this particular Wally alligator.</i>

49:56.785 --> 49:58.286
It can't just be an alligator.

49:58.370 --> 50:01.248
It can't be something that's like,
"That's just an alligator."

50:01.331 --> 50:05.335
We really wanted it to give
that kind of cheeky Loki grin

50:05.419 --> 50:07.921
<i>or that mischievous look to him.</i>

50:08.005 --> 50:13.885
So, we based our alligator off of
as much reality as we possibly could.

50:15.095 --> 50:16.221
(SNARLING)

50:20.017 --> 50:22.227
(SCREAMING)

50:29.651 --> 50:34.781
HIDDLESTON: <i>Inside The Void is</i>
<i>a living storm that consumes matter.</i>

50:34.865 --> 50:37.409
You can think of the biggest storm
you've ever seen.

50:37.492 --> 50:40.203
<i>Thunder, lightning, dark clouds.</i>

50:40.287 --> 50:42.789
<i>And the storm is called Alioth.</i>

50:44.374 --> 50:45.917
(RUMBLING)

50:46.001 --> 50:47.127
HERRON: <i>I love monster movies.</i>

50:47.210 --> 50:49.004
And trying to tackle a monster

50:49.087 --> 50:52.716
<i>where we kind of give little tastes</i>
<i>and teases of this creature,</i>

50:52.799 --> 50:56.178
<i>but we don't kind of show him off</i>
<i>completely until the big showdown.</i>

50:56.261 --> 50:57.721
<i>'Cause I love</i> Jaws,

50:57.804 --> 51:00.474
<i>and I think something really effective</i>
<i>about that film is that</i>

51:00.557 --> 51:03.101
you get peeks at the shark,
but you don't completely see it

51:03.185 --> 51:05.312
until the big finale on the boat.

51:05.687 --> 51:08.899
<i>And I think, for us, we were really</i>
<i>inspired with Alioth by nature,</i>

51:08.982 --> 51:10.442
<i>and nature can be terrifying.</i>

51:12.611 --> 51:14.571
MCDONALD: <i>While they were</i>
<i>pitching the story,</i>

51:14.654 --> 51:18.158
I literally was like, "Hey, guys,
could you give me one second?"

51:18.575 --> 51:19.951
<i>And I jumped on Google.</i>

51:20.035 --> 51:24.414
<i>And I'd seen a documentary</i>
<i>on volcanic eruptions,</i>

51:24.498 --> 51:28.752
<i>and pyroclastic flows,</i>
<i>and just absolutely beautiful, uh,</i>

51:28.835 --> 51:32.047
<i>thermal lightning</i>
<i>inside these pyroclastic flows.</i>

51:34.382 --> 51:35.926
<i>So, I got the job,</i>

51:36.009 --> 51:40.847
<i>and then the first thing that I said</i>
<i>as soon as I had boots on the ground was,</i>

51:40.931 --> 51:43.892
"We need to start
lookdeving this character."

51:45.102 --> 51:48.730
<i>We put together this absolutely</i>
<i>fantastic kind of package</i>

51:48.814 --> 51:53.110
<i>that had a very, very short</i>
<i>animation of Alioth</i>

51:53.193 --> 51:55.070
in what I envisioned him to be.

51:55.278 --> 51:59.491
Come and get me! Come on!

51:59.574 --> 52:03.203
<i>The main thing with Alioth is that</i>
<i>even Kid Loki describes, as he says,</i>

52:03.286 --> 52:06.248
"He's a shark,
and we're in his tank, basically."

52:06.331 --> 52:09.543
<i>I think that was the key thing</i>
<i>with Alioth, is that he's a predator,</i>

52:09.626 --> 52:11.211
<i>and he's just there to eat.</i>

52:11.294 --> 52:15.006
<i>And it's great 'cause the TVA are just</i>
<i>throwing him loads of T-bone steaks.</i>

52:20.929 --> 52:24.266
HIDDLESTON: <i>"It was the best of times,</i>
<i>it was the worst of times."</i>

52:24.349 --> 52:27.018
<i>It also happens to be the end of time.</i>

52:27.519 --> 52:29.396
<i>In the final episode of</i> Loki,

52:29.479 --> 52:32.274
<i>after jumping from New York</i>
<i>to the Gobi Desert</i>

52:32.357 --> 52:37.195
<i>to the TVA to a Renaissance fair</i>
<i>to Pompeii to Roxxcart to...</i>

52:37.863 --> 52:39.030
<i>You get the idea.</i>

52:39.114 --> 52:42.033
<i>-Long, strange trip and all that jazz.</i>
-LOKI: Ow!

52:42.117 --> 52:44.870
HIDDLESTON:
<i>After all the space-time shenanigans,</i>

52:44.953 --> 52:47.956
<i>our heroes arrive at their destination.</i>

52:48.039 --> 52:49.499
<i>The end of the road trip</i>

52:49.583 --> 52:53.920
<i>where you get out of the car,</i>
<i>stretch your legs, and continue on,</i>

52:54.004 --> 52:56.798
<i>barely pausing to reflect</i>
<i>on the journey behind you.</i>

52:57.382 --> 53:00.677
<i>It's a refreshing change</i>
<i>to go into the final act of a story,</i>

53:00.760 --> 53:04.055
<i>where Loki is neither</i>
<i>leading an alien horde into battle</i>

53:04.139 --> 53:06.641
<i>nor knifing a loved one in the back.</i>

53:11.980 --> 53:14.649
Usually in Marvel,
the third act of the story

53:14.733 --> 53:18.069
is obviously, like, a massive battle
and a huge, amazing spectacle.

53:18.153 --> 53:21.281
<i>And I feel like our Episode Five</i>
<i>of Alioth is sort of</i>

53:21.364 --> 53:24.367
<i>almost like a traditional third act</i>
<i>of an MCU story.</i>

53:24.784 --> 53:28.371
<i>Whereas I loved in Episode Six that</i>
<i>it was actually more within our show like,</i>

53:28.455 --> 53:31.249
"No, we're gonna sit down,
and we're gonna have a conversation

53:31.333 --> 53:33.627
"about all these questions
we've put forward to you guys

53:33.710 --> 53:35.295
"over the last six hours."

53:35.378 --> 53:40.258
<i>After a very long journey,</i>
<i>Sylvie and Loki are able to discover</i>

53:40.342 --> 53:43.595
that the TVA had an architect.

53:43.678 --> 53:49.351
<i>At the end of time, beyond The Void,</i>
<i>beyond Alioth, is a doorway,</i>

53:49.434 --> 53:52.145
<i>and through the doorway is a Citadel.</i>

53:52.229 --> 53:56.566
<i>The Citadel is essentially uninhabited</i>
<i>and abandoned.</i>

53:56.650 --> 53:59.861
<i>But there is one solitary light on</i>
<i>in the window,</i>

53:59.945 --> 54:03.698
and that light is illuminated
by He Who Remains.

54:09.246 --> 54:13.083
HERRON: <i>I was really inspired</i>
<i>by the idea of this kind of manor house</i>

54:13.166 --> 54:15.126
<i>like</i> Sunset Boulevard <i>or</i> Grey Gardens.

54:15.210 --> 54:18.421
<i>These basically big, ornate houses,</i>
<i>but there's a loneliness to them.</i>

54:18.505 --> 54:20.799
Then something that
Kasra came up with that...

54:20.882 --> 54:23.969
<i>Which I thought was so inspired,</i>
<i>was that the Citadel's actually carved</i>

54:24.052 --> 54:25.428
<i>from the rock of this asteroid,</i>

54:25.512 --> 54:27.764
<i>which I think gives it</i>
<i>such a beautiful, unique look</i>

54:27.847 --> 54:31.101
<i>with the gold veins running through</i>
<i>this black kind of rock.</i>

54:31.184 --> 54:33.645
<i>I really wanted the Citadel</i>
<i>to feel like it had big scale,</i>

54:33.728 --> 54:37.607
<i>because it only added to He Who Remains'</i>
<i>loneliness and isolation,</i>

54:37.691 --> 54:40.068
and, like, what lengths
he's gone for basically

54:40.151 --> 54:42.070
to protect himself from himself.

54:42.153 --> 54:45.699
WRIGHT: The Wizard of Oz
<i>was a big touchstone.</i>

54:45.782 --> 54:50.161
<i>It's somebody who is looming large</i>
<i>over the story</i>

54:50.245 --> 54:55.417
and is the driving force of the mystery
of finding the man behind the curtain.

54:55.917 --> 54:57.752
And hopefully being surprised by

54:57.836 --> 55:01.423
<i>what you find when you finally</i>
<i>get a peek behind the curtain.</i>

55:01.506 --> 55:03.717
This is wild. (CHUCKLES)

55:04.301 --> 55:06.052
WRIGHT: <i>Once you see behind the curtain,</i>

55:06.136 --> 55:07.470
everything is changed.

55:07.846 --> 55:12.267
<i>And so, I think, for that role,</i>
<i>it's so exciting for an actor then,</i>

55:12.350 --> 55:14.102
<i>like Jonathan to come in,</i>

55:14.185 --> 55:16.771
<i>and live this character and get to do it.</i>

55:16.855 --> 55:21.985
Because, while they're only here
for maybe 30 minutes of this series,

55:22.068 --> 55:27.407
it feels like they are just in the DNA
of the entire run of the show.

55:27.490 --> 55:29.326
I'd try to explain what I'm capable of,

55:29.451 --> 55:32.746
but we don't have the million years
it would take for you to understand.

55:33.455 --> 55:37.250
Some cultural pop references were,
of course, <i>The Wizard of Oz,</i>

55:37.334 --> 55:42.172
Sunset Boulevard, Citizen Kane,
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.

55:42.255 --> 55:44.883
<i>The archetype of the wizard</i>
<i>and what happens to him</i>

55:44.966 --> 55:47.802
when he gets bored, you know?
And he becomes a trickster.

55:47.886 --> 55:50.930
Guys, if I was gonna do
an exploding chair,

55:51.014 --> 55:52.807
why wouldn't I just do an exploding floor?

55:52.891 --> 55:55.685
<i>And I think when we meet He Who Remains,</i>

55:55.769 --> 55:57.645
<i>he's on the borderline</i>
<i>of those two things.</i>

55:57.729 --> 55:59.356
<i>You don't really know where he's at.</i>

55:59.439 --> 56:03.276
And I think the ambiguity of that
is one of the wicked things about it.

56:03.360 --> 56:09.157
You think I'm just here with you.

56:11.076 --> 56:12.952
Whoo! (CHUCKLES)

56:13.036 --> 56:15.997
I am everywhere.

56:16.790 --> 56:18.833
MAJORS: <i>He Who Remains has lived forever.</i>

56:18.917 --> 56:21.127
<i>One of the great things</i>
<i>I got to experience</i>

56:21.211 --> 56:22.879
with our costume designer is that

56:22.962 --> 56:27.258
every piece, we decided,
was from a different place.

56:27.342 --> 56:30.136
<i>The cape I had on</i>
<i>was from the Victorian era,</i>

56:30.220 --> 56:34.391
<i>the shoes are from Genghis Khan,</i>
<i>the pants from Mongolia, et cetera.</i>

56:34.474 --> 56:37.227
You just mix and match it together,
and it informs the character.

56:38.353 --> 56:42.732
Without the me, without the TVA...

56:45.610 --> 56:46.861
everything burns.

56:48.029 --> 56:49.572
Then what are you so afraid of?

56:52.075 --> 56:53.326
Me.

56:53.910 --> 57:00.333
Jonathan Majors came into this production
in our final week,

57:00.417 --> 57:02.585
<i>and has created something,</i>

57:02.669 --> 57:06.047
<i>I think, that it will be talked about</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

57:06.172 --> 57:07.799
-Yeah, we're dancin'.
-Very nice.

57:07.882 --> 57:09.717
-We're dancin', just dancin'.
-Yeah.

57:09.801 --> 57:13.263
WRIGHT: <i>It's absolutely thrilling.</i>
<i>And you could feel the energy on set,</i>

57:13.346 --> 57:14.973
<i>because I think the crew knew.</i>

57:15.056 --> 57:19.769
Like, we're watching the flowering
of the next phase of the Marvel Universe.

57:20.395 --> 57:23.273
HIDDLESTON:
<i>The Variant of He Who Remains,</i>

57:23.356 --> 57:26.776
<i>the one he's been talking about,</i>
<i>the one that he's so afraid of...</i>

57:26.860 --> 57:28.027
I'll see you soon.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.071
...is Kang.

57:30.947 --> 57:32.991
<i>Kang is bent on destruction.</i>

57:33.074 --> 57:36.953
<i>And I'm so curious to see</i>
<i>what Jonathan does in the future.</i>

57:37.412 --> 57:40.165
MAJORS: <i>I think with He Who Remains,</i>
<i>the objective for me</i>

57:40.248 --> 57:42.917
<i>was to give me</i>
<i>the largest canvas possible.</i>

57:43.001 --> 57:49.549
And then from that, as Kang begins
to rear his head and do his deeds,

57:50.216 --> 57:53.511
<i>in so many ways, he has no choice</i>
<i>but to be in opposition</i>

57:53.595 --> 57:56.014
<i>or to be different from He Who Remains.</i>

57:57.932 --> 58:00.602
That was the thing that grabbed me
and pulled me into the role.

58:00.685 --> 58:04.314
The fact that Kang
lives in so many iterations.

58:04.397 --> 58:07.108
As He Who Remains says,
"Reincarnation, baby."

58:07.192 --> 58:11.112
You know you can't get to the end
until you've been changed by the journey.

58:11.196 --> 58:13.781
This stuff, it needs to happen.

58:15.366 --> 58:19.412
HIDDLESTON: <i>The potential of a multiverse</i>
<i>is literally infinite.</i>

58:20.079 --> 58:23.750
<i>We can already look</i>
<i>at our singular universe with awe.</i>

58:23.833 --> 58:26.836
<i>One decision begets another and another.</i>

58:27.545 --> 58:29.214
<i>We like to say</i>

58:29.297 --> 58:31.382
<i>that the possibilities are endless.</i>

58:32.759 --> 58:35.720
<i>But in a singular timeline,</i>
<i>that is simply not the case.</i>

58:36.221 --> 58:39.015
<i>Each falling grain of sand in an hourglass</i>

58:39.098 --> 58:41.476
<i>changes how every other grain will fall.</i>

58:41.976 --> 58:46.272
<i>We're both masters of our own destiny</i>
<i>and victims of circumstance.</i>

58:46.856 --> 58:49.943
<i>There's simply no knowing</i>
<i>how things will turn out,</i>

58:50.568 --> 58:51.986
<i>until they happen.</i>

58:52.779 --> 58:55.823
<i>As William Shakespeare wrote</i>
<i>in</i> The Two Gentlemen of Verona,

58:56.282 --> 58:58.660
<i>"It ain't over till it's over."</i>

58:59.160 --> 59:01.371
<i>Or maybe that was Lenny Kravitz.</i>

59:01.454 --> 59:06.084
<i>Anyway, the future of Loki</i>
<i>is still unwritten,</i>

59:06.584 --> 59:09.087
<i>as it is with us all.</i>

59:11.673 --> 59:17.971
I will be 40 years old
when <i>Loki</i> goes out on Disney Plus.

59:18.054 --> 59:22.141
<i>And I was 29 years old</i>
<i>when I was cast as Loki,</i>

59:22.225 --> 59:24.811
<i>so it's been ten, going on for 11, years.</i>

59:25.186 --> 59:27.855
<i>It has been one of the great,</i>

59:27.939 --> 59:32.902
if not the greatest,
surprise of my whole life, probably.

59:33.361 --> 59:36.531
(LAUGHS) I mean, it just...
It's hard to sum up.

59:37.907 --> 59:39.867
<i>I was a young actor,</i>

59:39.951 --> 59:43.705
<i>and I felt so lucky even to have</i>
<i>the chance to audition for</i> Thor.

59:43.788 --> 59:48.751
Today was the first day
that I wore this particular costume.

59:48.835 --> 59:50.003
MAN: Under this...

59:50.086 --> 59:51.254
My best friend.

59:52.088 --> 59:53.506
-MAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Hello.

59:53.590 --> 59:57.176
In all my fittings way back, you know,
four, five months ago,

59:57.260 --> 59:59.387
I kept thinking, "When am I gonna
get the horns on?"

59:59.470 --> 1:00:02.056
<i>'Cause it's almost like</i>
<i>the last piece of the jigsaw</i>

1:00:02.140 --> 1:00:04.267
<i>in kind of becoming the character.</i>

1:00:04.350 --> 1:00:07.312
And to wear this thing is,
it feels enormously powerful.

1:00:07.395 --> 1:00:11.107
What happened to you on Earth
that turned you so soft?

1:00:11.190 --> 1:00:12.859
HIDDLESTON: <i>To be cast as Loki</i>

1:00:12.942 --> 1:00:16.404
<i>and to have that extraordinary</i>
<i>opportunity to make that film,</i>

1:00:16.487 --> 1:00:18.406
even as a standalone experience,

1:00:18.489 --> 1:00:21.576
<i>was more than</i>
<i>I could ever have dreamed of.</i>

1:00:21.659 --> 1:00:25.538
<i>As Loki, I had to play the villain</i>
<i>and then I had to play the anti-hero.</i>

1:00:25.622 --> 1:00:29.000
<i>And this time around is the first chance</i>

1:00:29.083 --> 1:00:34.547
<i>I've had to see if we can really</i>
<i>break the mold and change him.</i>

1:00:34.631 --> 1:00:36.341
Why aren't we seeing this the same way?

1:00:37.008 --> 1:00:38.509
Because you can't trust...

1:00:40.887 --> 1:00:41.971
and I can't be trusted.

1:00:42.055 --> 1:00:44.223
<i>I really want the fans to feel that energy</i>

1:00:44.307 --> 1:00:47.602
and feel excited and inspired
about where we go next.

1:00:47.685 --> 1:00:50.146
<i>You know, we're here</i>
<i>at the end of this shoot now.</i>

1:00:50.229 --> 1:00:53.650
<i>I hope we've made something</i>
<i>that people feel is very special.</i>

1:00:53.733 --> 1:00:55.902
I'd love to do one more after this
where I don't cry.

1:00:55.985 --> 1:00:57.195
(ALL LAUGHING)

1:00:57.278 --> 1:01:00.490
<i>I feel very grateful</i>
<i>that I'm part of a project</i>

1:01:00.573 --> 1:01:04.327
that I think has probably
changed the direction of the MCU.

1:01:12.210 --> 1:01:14.754
What people don't know is that...

1:01:14.837 --> 1:01:19.967
Is that Owen has basically
broken open the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

1:01:20.051 --> 1:01:21.928
That's what they call it, the MCU.

1:01:22.011 --> 1:01:23.096
What's that mean?

1:01:23.179 --> 1:01:24.889
-The Marvel Cinematic Universe.
-Yeah.

1:01:24.972 --> 1:01:27.809
So, the whole interweaving web
of all the movies.

1:01:27.892 --> 1:01:30.937
They're all stitched together.
They all reference each other.

1:01:31.020 --> 1:01:33.815
And Mobius has cracked it all open.

1:01:34.190 --> 1:01:35.191
It's true.

1:01:35.274 --> 1:01:38.569
(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
