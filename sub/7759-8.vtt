SO WE'VE GOT TIME
FOR ONE MORE,

10:59.159 --> 11:03.230
SO PUT A MORE POSITIVE SPIN

BUT I'M STILL LOOKING FOR

11:18.478 --> 11:20.914
THAT CERTAIN SOMEONE WHO...

11:20.948 --> 11:26.186
- WHO KNOWS THAT UNDERNEATH
THAT MILD-MANNERED APPEARANCE...

11:26.219 --> 11:29.456
BEATS THE HEART
OF A SUPERHERO.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.962
- I'M SORRY,
WHAT WAS THAT?

11:39.366 --> 11:44.304
[background chatter]

12:00.053 --> 12:02.222

THE DIFFERENCE.

12:07.127 --> 12:10.330
- HOLY SHIT!
IS THAT REAL GOLD?

12:10.363 --> 12:14.034
- I ALMOST BROKE A TOOTH
TESTING.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.503
MY SECRET ADMIRER
SENT IT TO ME.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.772
- WHO DO YOU THINK IT IS?

12:18.806 --> 12:20.540
- I KNOW WHO I'D LIKE IT
TO BE.

12:20.573 --> 12:25.045
A DASHING YOUNG PRINCE,
TOO SHY AT FIRST

12:25.078 --> 12:26.546
TO REVEAL
HE HAS A CRUSH ON ME.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.183
THEN HE APPEARS AND WHISKS ME
OFF TO HIS PALACE.

HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

IT'S HIGHLY UNREALISTIC.

MY FRIENDS WOULD PROBABLY
LAUGH IF THEY HEARD ME.

12:41.194 --> 12:44.131
- OH, WHAT DO THEY KNOW
ABOUT LOVE, HONEY?

12:44.164 --> 12:46.366
MOST OF THEM ARE TOO BUSY
CHASING THEIR HARD-ONS

12:46.399 --> 12:48.201
TO LISTEN TO THEIR HEART.

12:48.235 --> 12:51.171

12:51.204 --> 12:54.875

AN ADMIRABLE DREAM, HONEY.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.119
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU, EM,
IN MOST CASES,

13:06.153 --> 13:09.022
THAT KIND OF LOVE
ONLY HAPPENS IN THE MOVIES,

13:09.056 --> 13:12.192
AND EVEN THEN,
ONLY TO AUDREY HEPBURN.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.828
REAL LOVE, WHEN IT COMES,
DOESN'T LOOK

13:14.862 --> 13:17.898

WHAT YOU EXPECT.

TAUGHT ME BETTER.

13:44.057 --> 13:47.060

I'M NOT HIS MOTHER.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.996

IS EXPECTING YOU.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.899

IS YOUR EMPLOYER?

13:51.932 --> 13:56.136

HE'S NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.976
- OH MY GOD!
- HE'S PERFECT.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.812
- AND HE WANTS
TO MEET YOU TONIGHT.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.881
[both chuckle]

23:01.914 --> 23:03.816
- I GOTTA GIVE BRIAN CREDIT,
HE CAN SELL ANYTHING,

23:03.850 --> 23:05.452
[door opens]
EVEN ME.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.019
- HEY, EM, YOU WANNA SEE
MY DREAM DATE?

23:07.053 --> 23:08.621
- FUCK OFF.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.590
- WHO PISSED ON YOUR PARADE?

23:10.623 --> 23:14.494
- MY SECRET ADMIRER.
- YOU DIDN'T.

23:14.527 --> 23:17.697
I THOUGHT WE AGREED THAT THIS
WASN'T REALLY A GOOD IDEA.

23:17.730 --> 23:21.033
- I KNOW, BUT HIS CHAUFFEUR
PICKED ME UP.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.702
- YOU DID IT
WITH HIS CHAUFFEUR?

23:22.735 --> 23:25.738
- NO, SWEETIE,
HIS CHAUFFEUR DROVE ME

23:25.772 --> 23:28.775
TO HIS PLACE...

LOOK LIKE A WINNEBAGO.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.613
- SO WHO IS THIS GUY,
ANYWAY?

23:33.646 --> 23:36.649
- GEORGE SCHICKEL.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.518
- "SCHICKEL'S PICKLES"?

23:38.551 --> 23:39.919
- "THE PICKLE
THE PEOPLE PREFER"?

23:39.952 --> 23:42.689
- WELL, HE CAN KEEP
HIS PICKLE.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.657
IT'S LIKE, 300 YEARS OLD.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.192
- THEY SAY
HE'S WORTH A FORTUNE.

23:46.225 --> 23:49.662
- WELL, UNFORTUNATELY
FOR HIM,

23:49.696 --> 23:50.930
HE FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING

23:50.963 --> 23:53.866
THAT EVEN HIS MONEY
CAN'T BUY,

23:53.900 --> 23:55.735
NAMELY ME.

23:55.768 --> 23:56.903
- HE THINKS YOU'RE A--

23:56.936 --> 23:59.205
- A HUSTLER!
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

23:59.238 --> 24:01.741
- UNBELIEVABLE.
- THE NERVE.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.209
- I TOLD HIM,
"I AM AN ARTIST.

24:03.242 --> 24:06.245
"WHAT I DO
REQUIRES CONCENTRATION,

24:06.278 --> 24:08.481
DEDICATION,
DETERMINATION."

24:08.515 --> 24:09.816
- DON'T FORGET EJACULATION.

24:09.849 --> 24:13.219
- TAKE MY WORD,
IT'S A LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.

24:13.252 --> 24:15.688
AND IF YOU'RE WATCHING,
MR. SCHICKEL,

24:15.722 --> 24:19.892
WHAT YOU SEE IS DEFINITELY
NOT WHAT YOU GET.

24:19.926 --> 24:22.929

AS YOU CAN SEE *

24:38.277 --> 24:42.849
* NO ONE BUT YOU
BRINGS THE BAD SIDE OUT IN ME *

24:42.882 --> 24:46.285
* THE WORLD OUTSIDE
SEES JUST ONE FACE *

24:46.318 --> 24:48.955
- UH, JUSTIN?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.857
HAVING A GOOD TIME?

24:50.890 --> 24:51.658
- CAN'T YOU TELL?

24:51.691 --> 24:53.726
- YES, WELL,
YOU HAVE TO MINGLE.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.695
- WITH YOUR
HAPPY HETERO FRIENDS?

24:55.728 --> 24:58.130
- LOOK, IF I CAN DEAL
WITH THE HOMOS AT WOODY'S,

24:58.164 --> 24:59.766
YOU CAN HANDLE THEM, HMM?

24:59.799 --> 25:02.869
- YEAH, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.872
NO ONE TO HANDLE.

YOU ONLY HAVE TO ASK *

25:18.785 --> 25:22.922

I'LL EVER SHOW *

* WHATEVER YOU DESIRE,
YOU KNOW I CAN'T SAY NO *

25:26.959 --> 25:31.163
* CAN'T SAY NO

25:31.197 --> 25:35.902
* I'M SO WEAK,
BUT YOU'RE SO STRONG *

25:35.935 --> 25:40.172
* YOU'RE SO RIGHT
THAT I WANNA DO WRONG *

- WAIT.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.303
WE HAVE TO BE SAFE.

26:11.337 --> 26:14.106
- DON'T WORRY.

26:14.140 --> 26:18.210
I COME PREPARED.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.212
PUT IT ON MY DICK.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.681
- JUST, UH...

26:21.714 --> 26:24.083
GO SLOWLY, OKAY?

26:24.116 --> 26:27.654
I-I'VE NEVER...

26:27.687 --> 26:29.889
- I DIDN'T THINK SO.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.892
I'LL TAKE IT EASY.

26:32.925 --> 26:40.867
*

26:46.005 --> 26:47.339
- I THOUGHT YOU
WERE GOING OUT.

- [scoffs] AND MISS
THE BETTY HUTTON FILM FESTIVAL?

26:51.744 --> 26:54.380
- MY DATE IS COMING OVER.
- SO?

26:54.413 --> 26:55.381
- HE LOOKS REALLY HOT.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.817
WHAT IF WE WANT TO FUCK
RIGHT HERE ON THE FLOOR?

26:57.850 --> 27:01.353
- I PROMISE NOT TO LEAVE
ANY CRUMBS.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.155
AND I HATE TO BURST
YOUR BUBBLE, BABY,

27:03.189 --> 27:05.858
BUT MOST OF THOSE GUYS
DON'T EVEN USE THEIR OWN PHOTOS,

27:05.892 --> 27:08.194
OR ELSE THEY TOOK IT,
LIKE, 30 YEARS AGO.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.996
- DON'T BE SO CYNICAL.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.198
- AND DON'T BE SURPRISED
WHEN HE SHOWS UP AT THE DOOR,

27:12.231 --> 27:14.033
TURNS OUT TO BE
SOME OLD GEEZER.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.401
- LOOK, JUST 'CAUSE YOU
HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE...

27:15.434 --> 27:16.703
[knock at door]

27:16.736 --> 27:17.870
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT EVERYONE'S OUT

27:17.904 --> 27:20.707
TO GET WHATEVER THEY WANT
BY WHATEVER MEANS THEY CAN.

27:20.740 --> 27:25.311
THERE'S STILL SOME
HONEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.415
YOU'RE RIGHT,
THEY ALL LIE.

HE'S LIKE THIS 300-YEAR-OLD GUY
IN A RED CARDIGAN.

THAT ONE'S FOR ME.

MR. SCHICKEL, I DO NOT
APPRECIATE BEING STALKED,

27:44.196 --> 27:45.965
SO KINDLY REMOVE YOURSELF
FROM MY DOORWAY,

27:45.998 --> 27:48.100
MY BUILDING, MY STREET,
AND MY LIFE.

27:48.134 --> 27:51.871
- PLEASE, PLEASE, I...

27:51.904 --> 27:53.873
I'VE GONE TO A LOT
OF TROUBLE TO FIND YOU.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.407
- QUITE UNNECESSARY,
I ASSURE YOU.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.209
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
I-I WAS--

27:57.243 --> 27:59.345
I WAS JUST HORRIFIED
WHEN I REALIZED

27:59.378 --> 28:01.180
THAT I'D MADE SUCH A...

28:01.213 --> 28:03.449
REALLY SERIOUS
MISCALCULATION.

28:03.482 --> 28:07.019
- A MISCALCULATION IS WHEN YOU
CAN'T BALANCE YOUR CHECKBOOK.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.421
THIS WAS--
- AN INSULT.

28:09.455 --> 28:12.058
I REALIZE THAT.

28:12.091 --> 28:16.128
SO I HAVE COME HERE
TO OFFER YOU MY APOLOGIES...

28:16.162 --> 28:18.130
AND, UH...

28:18.164 --> 28:21.868
AND THIS...

28:21.901 --> 28:25.104
BECAUSE I WOULD STILL
LIKE YOU TO HAVE IT.

28:30.843 --> 28:34.280
- I DON'T ACCEPT GIFTS
FROM FANS.

28:34.313 --> 28:37.083
- THEN HAVE DINNER WITH ME.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.985
- SORRY, I ALREADY--

28:39.018 --> 28:41.087
- PLEASE.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.321
PLEASE?

28:42.354 --> 28:45.324
IT WOULD JUST BE A SMALL,
BUT NEVERTHELESS,

28:45.357 --> 28:48.094
HEARTFELT EXPRESSION
OF MY DEEPEST REGRET

28:48.127 --> 28:50.897

IN SUCH A RUDE

28:50.930 --> 28:53.966
AND REPREHENSIBLE MANNER.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.969
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOUR MANNER'S THAT...

28:57.003 --> 28:58.537
REPREHENSIBLE.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.273
- [chuckles]

29:01.307 --> 29:05.011

- OH, MY GOD, YOU, UH...

29:27.934 --> 29:29.201
YOU REALLY ARE A DREAM.
[chuckles]

29:29.235 --> 29:33.205
MICHAEL,
YOUR DATE'S HERE.

29:33.239 --> 29:35.207
WHERE WERE YOU
TEN SECONDS AGO

29:35.241 --> 29:38.044
WHEN I WAS STILL AVAILABLE?

29:42.514 --> 29:43.883
- WELL, UM, COME IN.

29:43.916 --> 29:47.286
- THANKS.

29:47.319 --> 29:50.289
both: SO, UM...
[laughter]

29:50.322 --> 29:52.558
- I THOUGHT WE'D, UH,
DO MAYBE PIZZA AND A MOVIE.

29:52.591 --> 29:54.460
- OR, UH,
TEX-MEX AND DANCING.

29:54.493 --> 29:57.163
- OR WE COULD JUST STAY HERE
AND FUCK OUR BRAINS OUT.

29:57.196 --> 30:00.166
- UH, THAT ONE.
- [chuckles] YOU NEGATIVE?

30:00.199 --> 30:04.103
- YOU?

[distant party chatter]

30:08.174 --> 30:11.177
- NAH.
SO, UH...

30:11.210 --> 30:13.445
WHAT WAS YOURS LIKE?

30:13.479 --> 30:16.448
YOUR FIRST TIME?
- HMMM.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.385
I SAW HIM, I KNEW RIGHT AWAY
HE WAS THE ONE.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.421
- WERE YOU SCARED?
- [laughs] SHITLESS!

30:22.454 --> 30:23.923
[sighs]

30:23.956 --> 30:26.192
WE WENT BACK TO HIS PLACE.
I SWEAR...

30:26.225 --> 30:29.361
I COULDN'T SPEAK,
MY HEART WAS POUNDING SO HARD.

30:29.395 --> 30:33.199
I LET HIM FUCK ME THOUGH.

30:33.232 --> 30:36.936
I STILL REMEMBER
FEELING HIM INSIDE ME...

30:36.969 --> 30:38.337
SEEING HIS FACE
WHEN HE CAME.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.538
[pounding on door]

30:39.571 --> 30:41.240
WANTING IT TO GO ON
FOREVER.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.075
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
[pounding on door]

30:43.109 --> 30:44.543
- WE NEED OUR COATS.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.312
- FUCK OFF!

30:46.345 --> 30:49.415
[both laugh]

30:49.448 --> 30:51.650
- GOD, I HATE
THESE STUPID PARTIES.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.953
- AH, ME TOO.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.254
I WOULDN'T HAVE COME,
BUT IF I DIDN'T,

30:55.287 --> 30:58.124
MY FRIEND DAPHNE
WOULD NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.892
- WELL, I USUALLY END UP
STANDING IN THE CORNER

30:59.926 --> 31:03.129
WATCHING THE "DUDES"
AND "BABES" AND...

31:03.162 --> 31:07.233
THINKING HOW I SHOULD HAVE
STAYED HOME AND WATCHED MTV.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.969
- WHY DON'T YOU
GO TO THE CLUBS AND BARS?

31:10.002 --> 31:13.940
YOU'D MEET
LOTS OF GUYS THERE.

31:15.607 --> 31:18.377
- I DON'T WANT TO MEET
A LOT OF GUYS.

31:18.410 --> 31:23.916
I WANT TO MEET JUST ONE
THAT I CAN BE WITH...

31:23.950 --> 31:26.652
JUST THE TWO OF US.

31:26.685 --> 31:28.120
- [scoffs]
YEAH.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.689
THINGS DON'T EXACTLY
WORK OUT THAT WAY.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.359
- THEY CAN
IF YOU WANT THEM TO.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.393
[pounding on door]

31:34.426 --> 31:35.661
- COME ON!

31:35.694 --> 31:39.898
- I GUESS WE BETTER GET DRESSED.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.302
- HURRY UP!

31:43.335 --> 31:47.306
- COME BACK HERE.

31:49.408 --> 31:52.311
- COME ON!
[pounding on door]

31:55.314 --> 31:59.952
- MMM! MMM,
I LOVE BURGER QUEEN!

31:59.986 --> 32:01.053
- [chuckles]

32:01.087 --> 32:05.257
BUT YOU KNOW, FOR ME,
WHAT MAKES IT A ROYAL TREAT

32:05.291 --> 32:09.028
IS NOT THE ALL-MEAT PATTY
OR THE SPECIAL BUN.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.263
IT'S THE PICKLES.
- AH.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.398
I RELISH THE COMPLIMENT.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.166
[laughter]

32:14.200 --> 32:16.668
AND THEY'RE--THEY'RE--
THEY ARE MINE, YOU KNOW.

32:16.702 --> 32:17.669
- OH, YEAH?
- OH, YEAH.

32:17.703 --> 32:18.971
- OH.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.472
I'M A PICKLE-LOVER
FROM WAY BACK.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.475
MY GREAT AUNT LULAH
BACK IN HAZELHURST, MISSISSIPPI,

32:23.509 --> 32:25.211
SHE USED TO MAKE 'EM.

32:25.244 --> 32:28.147
SHE HAD A VAT RIGHT OUT THERE
ON HER KITCHEN PORCH.

32:28.180 --> 32:31.117
I'D GO OVER THERE
EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL,

32:31.150 --> 32:32.584
AND WE'D SIT OUT BACK

32:32.618 --> 32:36.488
AND GAB AND SUCK ON
THOSE BIG OLD THINGS.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.190
WHICH WAS PROBABLY
MORE SIGNIFICANT

32:38.224 --> 32:40.326
TO LATER STAGES OF MY
PSYCHO-SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT

32:40.359 --> 32:41.760
THAN I CARE TO GO INTO.

32:41.793 --> 32:45.464
- [laughs]

32:45.497 --> 32:47.466
YOU HAD A REALLY
COLORFUL FAMILY.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.468
- I PREFER TO THINK OF THEM
AS LUNATICS.

32:49.501 --> 32:52.471
- YEAH.
- EXCEPT FOR AUNT LULAH,

32:52.504 --> 32:55.207
WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE CRAZY ONE.

32:55.241 --> 32:57.276
SHE WAS MY ONLY FRIEND.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.745
THE REST OF THEM
WANTED NOTHING TO DO

32:59.778 --> 33:03.282
WITH THE--
THE LOCAL SISSY BOY.

33:03.315 --> 33:07.086
- MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY LONELY.
- HMM.

33:07.119 --> 33:10.089
DIDN'T STOP ME FROM BEING
WHO I WANTED TO BE.

33:10.122 --> 33:13.525
FUCK 'EM ALL!
THAT WAS MY MOTTO.

33:13.559 --> 33:16.628
STILL IS.
[laughs]

33:16.662 --> 33:20.666
- WELL, I ADMIRE
YOUR COURAGE.

33:20.699 --> 33:23.602
I WISH I'D HAD IT.

33:23.635 --> 33:26.705
INSTEAD I CHOSE
TO LIVE A LIE,

33:26.738 --> 33:28.740
SUBJUGATING MY FREEDOM,
MY DESIRES

33:28.774 --> 33:31.643
TO THE FAMILY FORTUNE.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.513
I EVEN ALLOWED THEM
TO MARRY ME OFF

33:34.546 --> 33:36.182
TO THIS MEAT-PACKING HEIRESS

33:36.215 --> 33:39.185
SO THAT WE COULD MAKE
BEAUTIFUL SANDWICHES TOGETHER.

33:39.218 --> 33:41.787
OH, IT WAS
A PERFECT MERGER...

33:41.820 --> 33:44.556
TILL ONE DAY
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO,

33:44.590 --> 33:48.427
SHE CAME HOME AND CAUGHT ME
GIVING THE GARDENER A BLOW JOB

33:48.460 --> 33:51.263
RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF
HER PRIZE-WINNING ROSE GARDEN.

33:51.297 --> 33:52.831
- WHY, GEORGE.
- [chuckles]

33:52.864 --> 33:55.467
- YOU RAKE.
FRENCH FRY?

33:55.501 --> 33:56.802
- MMM!

33:56.835 --> 34:00.072
WELL, IT WASN'T AS IF
I WERE CHEATING ON HER.

34:00.106 --> 34:03.475
I MEAN, WE HADN'T
HAD SEX SINCE 1972.

34:03.509 --> 34:07.546
BUT SHE, UH,
SUED ME FOR MILLIONS.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.815
TURNED THE CHILDREN
AGAINST ME.

34:09.848 --> 34:15.321
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
I BECAME A SOCIAL PARIAH.

34:15.354 --> 34:19.725
- AT LEAST YOU WERE
FINALLY FREE TO BE YOURSELF.

34:19.758 --> 34:23.262
- YEAH, YEAH, TO BE ALONE,
FRIENDLESS...

34:23.295 --> 34:28.567
AND BUYING COMPANIONSHIP
OVER THE INTERNET.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.237
WELL...

34:31.270 --> 34:35.241
FUCK 'EM ALL.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.442
- [panting]

34:36.475 --> 34:38.577
OH, MAN.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.413
[both panting]

34:41.447 --> 34:43.149
- YOU ARE PERFECT.

34:43.182 --> 34:45.284
- I KNOW.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.419
BUT I WASN'T ALWAYS.

34:47.453 --> 34:50.589
I USED TO WEIGH 350.
I WAS BALD.

34:50.622 --> 34:53.159
I HAD HIDEOUS, COARSE
BODY HAIR ALL OVER MY BACK,

34:53.192 --> 34:55.561
MY SHOULDERS, MY STOMACH.
- REALLY?

34:55.594 --> 34:59.331
- NOT TO MENTION NO CHIN,
HUGE HONKER, ZERO CHEEKBONES.

34:59.365 --> 35:00.366
DEFINITELY NOT
A PRETTY SIGHT.

35:00.399 --> 35:01.167
- BUT YOU LOOK SO--

35:01.200 --> 35:02.734
- IT ALL STARTED
WITH LIPOSUCTION,

35:02.768 --> 35:04.836
THEN A SERIES OF OPERATIONS
TO TIGHTEN MY SKIN.

35:04.870 --> 35:08.574
NEXT, LASER HAIR REMOVAL,
EVERYWHERE EXCEPT MY PUBES,

35:08.607 --> 35:10.209
WHICH, OF COURSE, I TRIM.
- OF COURSE.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.677
- AFTER THAT,
HAIR TRANSPLANTATION,

35:11.710 --> 35:15.381
SCALP REDUCTION, NOSE JOB,
CHEEK AND CHIN IMPLANTS.

35:15.414 --> 35:16.548
- THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
EXPENSIVE.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.284
- OH, A HUNDRED THOU,
GIVE OR TAKE,

35:18.317 --> 35:19.618
MY FOLKS HAVE MONEY.

35:19.651 --> 35:22.354
NOW, I WORK OUT
WITH A TRAINER, ADOLPH,

35:22.388 --> 35:24.690
FIVE HOURS A DAY,
SIX DAYS A WEEK.

35:24.723 --> 35:27.226
IT'S BRUTAL,
BUT GOTTA MAINTAIN.

35:27.259 --> 35:29.861
AND FOOD COMBINING,
VERY IMPORTANT.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.663
YOU CAN EAT PROTEINS
WITH VEGETABLES

35:31.697 --> 35:32.931
OR CARBS WITH VEGETABLES,

35:32.964 --> 35:35.634
BUT NEVER, NEVER, NEVER.
PROTEINS WITH CARBS.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.936
- GOT IT.
- SUPPLEMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.607
- YOU WANT SOME HAAGEN-DAZS?

35:41.640 --> 35:44.576
- HAVE YOU BEEN LISTENING?

35:44.610 --> 35:46.912
YOU KNOW...

35:46.945 --> 35:49.948
YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE IMPROVING YOURSELF.

35:49.981 --> 35:53.652
LASER HAIR REMOVAL
ON YOUR CHEST, PEC IMPLANTS.

35:53.685 --> 35:57.189
THE BRIDGE OF YOUR NOSE
IS DEFINITELY--IT'S TOO WIDE.

35:57.223 --> 36:01.260
A-AND NOTHING PERSONAL,
BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER

36:01.293 --> 36:02.794
A-A PENILE EXTENSION.

36:02.828 --> 36:06.398
- THANKS FOR THE TIP.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.951
- [moaning softly]

36:25.984 --> 36:28.920
- YOU'RE FINALLY UP.
- [laughs]

36:28.954 --> 36:30.756
WHAT TIME IS IT?

36:30.789 --> 36:32.824
- IT'S TIME TO TAKE CARE
OF YOUR MORNING HARD-ON,

36:32.858 --> 36:36.695
ALTHOUGH IT'S AFTER NOON.

36:36.728 --> 36:39.698
SOMEBODY GOT HOME
LATE LAST NIGHT.

36:39.731 --> 36:42.468
- 2:58, JUST UNDER THE WIRE.

36:42.501 --> 36:46.438
- OL' DAPHNE MUST HAVE HAD
SOME KICK-ASS PARTY.

36:46.472 --> 36:48.274
- MMM, YEAH,
IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

36:48.307 --> 36:49.575
- [sniffing]

36:49.608 --> 36:54.913
MY NOSE TELLS ME IT
WAS BETTER THAN ALL RIGHT.

36:54.946 --> 36:57.983
I SMELL A VARSITY
LACROSSE PLAYER.

36:58.016 --> 37:00.852
- YOU'RE WAY OFF.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.021
- HOLD ON.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.391
[sniffing]

37:05.424 --> 37:06.725
HM, IT'S COMING.

37:06.758 --> 37:09.361
- [laughs]
- [sniffing]

37:09.395 --> 37:12.598
A NICE, TIGHT COMPUTER NERD.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.533
- YOU'RE GETTING WARMER.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.934
- [sniffing]

37:15.967 --> 37:17.469
A SCENT OF INNOCENCE.

37:17.503 --> 37:20.472
A-A VIRGIN.

37:20.506 --> 37:24.776
- A LUCKY GUESS.

37:30.782 --> 37:33.552
- YOU KISSED HIM.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.791
- I THINK
I'LL GO TAKE A SHOWER.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.835
- THE FACE WAS GREAT.
THE BODY WAS GREAT.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.036
THE SEX WAS GREAT.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.504
AND THEN HE STARTED TALKING.

37:52.538 --> 37:53.539
- SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.706
YOU HAD SEX ON A DATE

37:54.740 --> 37:55.741
BEFORE YOU EVEN
HAD A CONVERSATION?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.042
- YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.777
- AND WHY'S THAT?

37:58.810 --> 38:01.380
- BECAUSE SEX IS DIFFERENT
FOR MEN THAN IT IS FOR WOMEN.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.515
THE NEED IS MORE IMMEDIATE,
MORE INTENSE.

38:03.549 --> 38:04.650
AT LEAST
THAT'S WHAT I'VE READ.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.452
- WHERE,
IN FIELD AND STREAM?

38:06.485 --> 38:09.087
- UH, JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
LINDSAY AND I FUCK LIKE CRAZY.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.023
WE PANT AND DROOL LIKE
A COUPLE OF BITCHES IN HEAT.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.659
OUR PUSSIES
SOAK THE SHEETS.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.060
- AND WE GO AT IT
A LOT LONGER

38:15.093 --> 38:16.562
THAN THE TEN-MINUTE TUMBLE
YOU GUYS CALL SEX.

38:16.595 --> 38:17.763
- AND YOU
DON'T EVEN WANNA KNOW

38:17.796 --> 38:18.764
HOW MANY TIMES WE GET OFF
IN A NIGHT.

38:18.797 --> 38:19.898
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.533
- HI, HONEY.
- MOM...

38:21.567 --> 38:23.335
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DID SOMETHING SCARE YOU?

38:23.369 --> 38:24.570
- JUST US.

38:24.603 --> 38:26.905
- I THINK MICHAEL
HAD A BAD DATE.

38:26.938 --> 38:29.408
- I TOLD YOU TO CALL IDA,
FOR CHRIST SAKES.

38:29.441 --> 38:30.842
SHE'S A FUCKING GENIUS.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.611
- I'LL END UP
WITH A JEWISH PRINCESS.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.812
- YOU COULD END UP
WITH A LOT WORSE.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.982
- MMM.
- AWW.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.584
- [chuckles]
- [shudders]

38:40.419 --> 38:43.389
- [grunting]

38:43.422 --> 38:46.392
[faint techno music]

38:46.425 --> 38:47.959
*

38:47.993 --> 38:49.961
- JEEZ, EASY!

38:49.995 --> 38:51.730
YOU'VE GOT A LOT ON THERE.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.565
- I FEEL SLACK.
I NEED TO TIGHTEN UP.

38:53.599 --> 38:55.100
- YOU HAVE AN 18-YEAR-OLD
AT HOME.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.503
WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?
- KEEPING HIM.

38:57.536 --> 38:58.970
IT'S A SHAME YOU CAN'T ENJOY
YOUR GOLDEN YEARS

38:59.004 --> 39:01.673
WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT
EVERY SAG, EVERY WRINKLE.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.074
- AH, I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS

39:03.108 --> 39:05.110
WHEN YOU'RE DATING
SOMEONE SO MANY,

39:05.143 --> 39:07.145
MANY YEARS YOUR JUNIOR.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.014
THERE'S ALWAYS THAT
CONSTANT NAGGING FEAR

39:09.047 --> 39:12.083
HE'S GONNA DUMP YOU
FOR A HOTTER, CUTER, YOUNGER,

39:12.117 --> 39:13.852
FIRMER STUD.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.021
- YEAH, I DON'T ENVY YOU
YOUR YOUTH.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.423
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO,

39:17.456 --> 39:19.625
SINCE YOU'RE
DATING SOMEONE WHO'S 103.

39:19.658 --> 39:23.829
- I'M NOT DATING HIM.
WE SHARED A BURGER.

39:23.862 --> 39:26.432
- [laughs]
HE CAN HAVE SOLIDS?

39:26.465 --> 39:29.000
- YOU KNOW,
GEORGE MAY NOT BE 29

39:29.034 --> 39:31.670
OR HAVE A PERFECT CHIN
OR A 30-INCH WAIST,

39:31.703 --> 39:33.772
BUT HE'S A LOT NICER
THAN CERTAIN ARROGANT,

39:33.805 --> 39:36.975
CONTEMPTUOUS, SELF-DELUDED
ASSHOLES THAT I KNOW.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.844
- DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
GONNA SEE HIM AGAIN.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.178
- NO, WHEN WE, UH--

39:40.211 --> 39:45.383
WHEN WE SAID GOOD NIGHT,
WE, UH, ALSO SAID GOOD-BYE.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.490
- YOU THINK
HE ACTUALLY LIKED HIM?

39:51.523 --> 39:54.426
- SOME GUYS ARE
INTO PRIME, AGED COCK.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.495
- BETTER HOPE JUSTIN IS.

39:56.528 --> 39:57.763
- [grunts]

39:57.796 --> 39:58.797
OH, GOD.

40:02.534 --> 40:03.368
- SO YOU'RE MICHAEL.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.572
OH, YOUR MOTHER
JUST RAVES ABOUT YOU.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.206
- YOU TOO.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.943
SO, ARE YOU
A P-FLAG MOM OR...

40:11.977 --> 40:15.881
- ACTUALLY,
I'M A P-FLAG SON.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.784
HAVE SOME BUNDT.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.218
OH, RELAX.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.454
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU GOTTA DATE ME.

40:22.488 --> 40:24.189
[clears throat]

40:24.222 --> 40:27.192
NOW, WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR?

40:27.225 --> 40:29.461
- UM, HE SHOULD BE TALL,

40:29.495 --> 40:31.497
BLUE EYES,
BUILT LIKE SUPERMAN.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.664
- WELL, WE ALL KNOW
YOU BOYS WANT BEAUTIES.

40:32.698 --> 40:34.032
THAT'S A GIVEN.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.801
- YOU ASKED ME
WHAT I WANTED.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.969
- I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE OUTSIDE.

40:38.003 --> 40:41.473
MICHAEL, SWEETHEART,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ON THE INSIDE?

40:41.507 --> 40:44.943
- I-I...
I DON'T KNOW.

40:44.976 --> 40:48.914
- SURE YOU DO.
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.483
THINK.

40:51.517 --> 40:54.052
- HE'S GOTTA BE PASSIONATE
ABOUT LIFE.

40:54.085 --> 40:57.022
HE'S WORKED HARD
TO SURVIVE IT...

40:57.055 --> 41:00.792
YET HE'S MAINTAINED
HIS HUMOR.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.193
HE'S CHARMING, KIND.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.095
- UH-HUH.

41:04.129 --> 41:07.065
- HE DOES SOMETHING CREATIVE,
MAYBE A WRITER.

41:07.098 --> 41:11.970
AND HE'S INTO SPIRITUAL STUFF,
LIKE BUDDHA.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.772
AND HE FOCUSES
ON LIVING IN THE NOW

41:13.805 --> 41:17.108
BECAUSE THERE'S
NO TIME TO WASTE.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.911
OH...

41:19.945 --> 41:25.083
AND WHEN I'M WITH HIM,
I FEEL LIKE A BETTER PERSON.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.819
- UH-HUH.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.955
UH...AHA!

41:29.988 --> 41:31.557
NO.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.992
AH! HERE HE IS.

41:34.025 --> 41:38.196
THE LIMELIGHT,
LIBERTY AVENUE, 8:00.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.965
SHOULDN'T I
SEE A PHOTOGRAPH?

41:39.998 --> 41:40.966
HOW WILL I KNOW
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE?

41:40.999 --> 41:42.067
- OH, YOU DON'T NEED ONE.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.936
TRUST ME, YOU'LL KNOW.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.906
- A NEW MEMBER.
- OOH!

41:47.939 --> 41:49.675
- I'LL HAVE AN ORDER OF HIM
ON THE SIDE.

41:49.708 --> 41:51.076
[lewd chuckles]

41:55.180 --> 41:57.883
- HONEY...

41:57.916 --> 42:00.151
JUST START BREATHING
AND TAKE A SEAT,

42:00.185 --> 42:01.587
AND I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

42:01.620 --> 42:04.890
- A-ACTUALLY,
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY.

42:04.923 --> 42:08.326
- IN THIS JOINT, WHO ISN'T?

42:08.359 --> 42:11.529
- JUSTIN!

42:15.300 --> 42:18.169
- FRIEND OF YOURS?
- [laughs]

42:18.203 --> 42:20.171
UH, DO YOU MIND
IF I TAKE A BREAK?

42:20.205 --> 42:23.308
- TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED...

42:23.341 --> 42:26.945
AS LONG AS YOU'RE BACK
IN FIVE MINUTES.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.015
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

42:30.048 --> 42:32.350
- I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU SINCE LAST NIGHT.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.319
I REALLY MISSED YOU.

42:34.352 --> 42:35.721
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

42:35.754 --> 42:38.289
- SURE I DO.
AND, UH...

42:38.323 --> 42:40.592
YOU KNOW ME TOO.

42:40.626 --> 42:43.328
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO COME HERE AGAIN, OKAY?

42:43.361 --> 42:46.765
- WHY NOT?
- 'CAUSE I SAID SO.

42:46.798 --> 42:48.066
- YEAH, BUT AFTER
WHAT HAPPENED,

42:48.099 --> 42:49.267
I THOUGHT THAT WE
COULD HAVE THIS--

42:49.300 --> 42:53.071
- NOTHING HAPPENED.
WE FUCKED, THAT'S ALL.

42:53.104 --> 42:56.074
- THAT'S NOT ALL.
I LOVE YOU.

42:56.107 --> 42:57.676
- [scoffs]
YOU DON'T LOVE ME.

42:57.709 --> 42:58.810
- AND FROM THE WAY
YOU KISSED ME,

42:58.844 --> 42:59.911
I CAN TELL
THAT WE HAD THIS CONNECT--

42:59.945 --> 43:02.814
- DO YOU KNOW
HOW PATHETIC YOU ARE?

43:02.848 --> 43:04.916
ONE LOUSY FUCK,
NOW YOU'RE CARRYING ON

43:04.950 --> 43:07.653
LIKE SOME LOVESICK FAIRY.

43:07.686 --> 43:09.821
YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN.

43:09.855 --> 43:12.691
FAGS WILL SAY ANYTHING
TO GET THEIR DICK SUCKED

43:12.724 --> 43:14.726
OR FUCK A NICE ASS.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.294
THEN IT'S ON TO THE NEXT.

43:16.327 --> 43:18.764
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

43:18.797 --> 43:21.032
I KNOW WHAT I FELT.

43:21.066 --> 43:23.101
- YEAH, WELL,
I DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING.

43:23.134 --> 43:27.272
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU'RE YESTERDAY'S FUCK.

43:28.406 --> 43:30.341
- [whimpers]

43:56.034 --> 43:59.270
- SHOULDN'T YOU
LET THE GARDENER DO THAT?

44:02.207 --> 44:05.844
- THE GARDENER'S
GOOD FOR SOME THINGS.

44:05.877 --> 44:07.245
IT'S A NEW GARDENER.

44:07.278 --> 44:10.348
- [laughs]

44:10.381 --> 44:12.918
- BUT THESE
NEED SPECIAL CARE.

44:15.721 --> 44:19.357
- WHO WOULD THINK
AN UGLY LITTLE THING LIKE THIS

44:19.390 --> 44:21.793
COULD CONTAIN
SOMETHING SO BEAUTIFUL?

44:21.827 --> 44:24.462
I USED TO HELP MY MOTHER
IN THE GARDEN.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.998
