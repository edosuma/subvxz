00:06.222 --> 00:09.589
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will soon be starting our in-flight movie.

00:09.759 --> 00:14.093
We will be coming through with headsets,
which are available for purchase for $4.

00:14.264 --> 00:18.098
And, of course, exact change
is always appreciated.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.736
Just water, please.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.398 --> 00:49.763
You need some headsets?

00:51.434 --> 00:53.026
You should put keys on your back.

00:53.203 --> 00:55.194
- Excuse me?
- It's an old wives' tale.

00:55.371 --> 00:57.669
- To stop the bloody nose.
- Yeah?

00:57.841 --> 01:01.106
Actually, I tried it once. It doesn't work.

01:01.277 --> 01:03.142
It's all bull.

01:05.081 --> 01:06.673
Excuse me.

01:12.589 --> 01:14.489
Excuse me.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.020
Excuse me.

01:51.628 --> 01:53.493
Excuse me. I need to talk to you.

01:53.663 --> 01:55.858
- I'll be with you in one moment.
- No, now!

01:57.267 --> 01:58.825
Please.

01:59.135 --> 02:00.693
I'll be right back.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.104
- What's the problem?
- I'm in trouble.

02:07.277 --> 02:10.678
Something's happening I don't
have the time or permission to explain.

02:10.847 --> 02:13.407
- What is it?
- You need to listen to me very carefully.

02:13.583 --> 02:18.043
Go to the passengers. Collect as many
sedatives or tranquilizers as you can.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.086
Okay, I need you to take a deep breath.

02:20.256 --> 02:22.281
This isn't a panic attack.

02:22.458 --> 02:24.392
This is real.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.195
We will die, all of us,
if you don't do what I say.

02:27.363 --> 02:29.729
A threat like that
is in violation of FAA reg...

02:29.899 --> 02:33.596
- Does it look like I care about that?
- Oh, my God.

02:35.171 --> 02:38.470
I need you to get those drugs for me.
Do you have any weapons? A gun.

02:38.675 --> 02:39.699
Go call the captain.

02:39.876 --> 02:42.709
I need you to calm down,
you're gonna scare the passengers.

02:42.879 --> 02:44.904
They should be.
What weapons do you have?

02:45.081 --> 02:46.412
- It's Melissa.
- What weapons?

02:46.583 --> 02:47.811
We have a man claiming...

02:47.984 --> 02:51.147
A Taser in the cockpit,
which I'll use if you don't calm down.

02:51.321 --> 02:53.755
A Taser won't do a thing.
It'll just piss me off.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.824
He wants drugs, but he seems
to be on something already.

02:56.993 --> 03:00.258
I need you to do what I say.
I'm going into that bathroom.

03:00.697 --> 03:03.291
You keep me in there.
You keep that door closed.

03:03.466 --> 03:05.559
Get whatever sedatives
as soon as you can.

03:05.735 --> 03:09.068
- You go in that bathroom, sir.
- I am not messing around.

03:09.239 --> 03:12.003
When you get the drugs,
you come back, you knock.

03:12.208 --> 03:16.144
If I don't answer, or if I do
and what you see isn't me anymore...

03:16.312 --> 03:18.746
...you keep that door closed.
You hear me?

03:18.915 --> 03:21.816
You keep me in there,
away from the other passengers.

03:21.985 --> 03:23.919
Get the drugs. Quick.

03:24.087 --> 03:26.021
Yes, sir. I'll do that.

04:00.556 --> 04:02.649
Yes, sir, but I think 40 minutes
is too long.

04:11.868 --> 04:14.894
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a passenger having a hard time.

04:15.071 --> 04:19.007
Please remain calm,
everything's gonna be just fine.

04:31.988 --> 04:34.582
- What's he doing in there?
- I don't know.

04:34.791 --> 04:36.486
He just got quiet.

04:36.659 --> 04:37.990
Maybe he passed out.

04:38.828 --> 04:41.353
The captain says we should
restrain him, but I've only...

05:22.372 --> 05:24.772
Seat belts. Seat belts.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.631
Well, hello.

05:55.805 --> 05:57.830
Look, Aunt Liv, I'm beautiful.

05:58.007 --> 05:59.668
Yes, you are beautiful.

05:59.842 --> 06:05.712
Yes, you're beautiful, but why don't
we put this down and take these off?

06:05.915 --> 06:10.716
Come here, give me... What else do
you have here? I'll take that. All right.

06:10.920 --> 06:14.185
- Go wash that off, okay?
- Okay.

06:14.557 --> 06:17.924
- Sorry.
- Oh, please, it's fine.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.363
Do you remember when we had
that sleepover at Aunt Missy's...

06:22.532 --> 06:26.491
...and you found the perfume
and then poured it all over...

06:27.437 --> 06:28.461
Was it Lola?

06:28.638 --> 06:31.106
No, Lola was the hamster.
Roxy was the dog.

06:31.274 --> 06:34.209
Liv, what is this? Is this Mom's?

06:35.511 --> 06:38.537
"Always." This isn't Mom's.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.173
No.

06:42.018 --> 06:43.508
It's from John.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.722
John. Your partner John?

06:48.324 --> 06:51.452
- Yeah.
- You told me that you guys were...

06:51.727 --> 06:53.217
He asked you to marry him?

06:53.396 --> 06:56.388
No. He didn't. It was a mistake.

06:56.566 --> 06:59.091
Suffice to say
that it never actually happened.

06:59.268 --> 07:01.600
- Uh, no, you can't do that.
- I have to.

07:01.771 --> 07:05.832
I am your sister and I have told you every
excruciating detail of my failed marriage.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.374
- There's nothing you can tell...
- He was a traitor.

07:11.547 --> 07:14.675
The people he was working with,
I still don't know who they were.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.547
But whoever they were, he was bad.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.211
And whatever was between us
was a lie.

07:20.389 --> 07:24.917
So that he could gain my trust so that
I didn't see him for what he was.

07:25.394 --> 07:27.385
God, Liv.

07:27.563 --> 07:32.227
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. Me too.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.772
And I thought Greg was a jerk.

07:37.940 --> 07:40.773
Well, Greg is a jerk.

07:40.943 --> 07:43.605
Yeah. Greg is a jerk.

07:43.779 --> 07:45.508
Hello?

07:47.450 --> 07:49.145
Where?

07:49.318 --> 07:52.151
Flight 718 went down a little after 6 p.m.

07:52.321 --> 07:54.881
Witnesses say the plane
just fell out of the sky.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.888
Once we recover the black box
we'll know more.

07:57.059 --> 08:00.119
So why are we here?
Shouldn't NTSB be taking point?

08:00.296 --> 08:04.790
Air-traffic control got a distress call
from the pilot, but it was cut off.

08:04.967 --> 08:08.801
What happened, I'm guessing, has to do
with what I'm about to show you.

08:08.971 --> 08:12.134
It's burned badly. Forensics
thought it was an animal at first.

08:12.441 --> 08:14.432
They were mistaken.

08:14.610 --> 08:17.078
No one's ever seen an animal like this.

08:19.982 --> 08:22.109
I can understand their confusion.

08:22.285 --> 08:26.483
This creature has pelage
characteristic of an animal.

08:27.190 --> 08:29.181
And yet...

08:40.102 --> 08:43.697
I will say this. Our friend here
didn't start out this way.

08:43.873 --> 08:45.602
Hey, Liv.

08:46.842 --> 08:48.366
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:48.578 --> 08:51.046
Copies of the manifest and passports.

08:51.214 --> 08:53.273
There's 147 passengers.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.780
Gonna be a long few days...

08:54.951 --> 08:57.647
...for the poor folks tasked
to identify the remains.

08:57.820 --> 08:59.788
So is there anyone of any interest?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.184
Not at first glance, no.

09:01.357 --> 09:03.951
The elder Bishop,
does he have any ideas about that?

09:04.126 --> 09:06.117
Not yet. Or if he does he isn't saying.

09:06.295 --> 09:08.855
So the official word
right now is engine failure.

09:09.031 --> 09:11.693
The pilot tried to bring it in
for an emergency landing.

09:11.867 --> 09:15.530
The landing gear failed to engage.
The pilot lost control.

09:17.607 --> 09:20.041
The way this thing works.
What it does to you.

09:20.209 --> 09:24.543
Horror show. Far worse than you can
imagine. I'm telling you, this stuff...

09:25.047 --> 09:26.537
It's a horror show, John.

09:28.251 --> 09:30.719
- What? You find something?
- Yeah.

09:30.886 --> 09:32.046
I think this is our guy.

09:34.490 --> 09:37.084
- The fried dog-man?
- Yeah. Marshall Bowman.

09:37.260 --> 09:40.024
We need to pull everything
we can find on him.

09:40.196 --> 09:41.356
How can you know that?

09:44.233 --> 09:45.825
Call it my gut.

09:47.036 --> 09:48.697
Your gut.

09:56.879 --> 10:01.578
I would expect
whatever caused this mutation...

10:01.751 --> 10:05.050
...would've completely altered
his internal organs.

10:06.255 --> 10:07.882
The kidneys appear normal.

10:08.057 --> 10:10.355
It also gave him four extra nipples.

10:10.526 --> 10:14.895
- Maybe he mutated into a possum.
- No, possums have 15 mammaries.

10:15.064 --> 10:18.522
Unlike most mammals,
who have an even number of nipples...

10:18.701 --> 10:21.397
...hence the one-half rule
regarding nipples.

10:21.570 --> 10:24.437
- The one-half nipple rule?
- You just had to ask, didn't you?

10:24.607 --> 10:26.598
The typical number of young in a litter...

10:26.776 --> 10:30.371
...is usually equal to half
the number of nipples on the animal.

10:30.546 --> 10:33.640
The number of nipples
being the maximum litter size.

10:33.816 --> 10:35.215
Humans, for example.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.477
One child is the typical.

10:38.487 --> 10:40.387
Maximum, twins.

10:42.491 --> 10:47.326
Barring extraordinary cases, when the
young far exceed the number of nipples.

10:47.496 --> 10:51.330
God, I hope I never have to hear him
say the word "nipple" again.

10:53.135 --> 10:56.571
Evidence of an extradural hematoma.

10:56.739 --> 10:57.831
Possibly epistaxis.

10:58.007 --> 10:59.998
Meaning he had a colossal nosebleed.

11:00.209 --> 11:01.301
I know.

11:03.145 --> 11:04.442
Hmm.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.712
There's something hard inside here.

11:11.153 --> 11:12.347
Scalpel.

11:19.295 --> 11:20.353
Forceps.

11:26.836 --> 11:28.497
What is it? A tumor?

11:33.776 --> 11:37.143
Not unless a tumor is made of glass.

11:39.348 --> 11:41.282
I need someone
over at VertusAir right now.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.115
Yes, this is about 718.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.219
Went through all the reports,
breakdowns.

11:45.388 --> 11:47.720
Here's everything on Bowman.
Forty-two years old.

11:47.890 --> 11:49.881
Worked out of Credit Cotier in Marseilles.

11:50.059 --> 11:51.686
Managed their corporate accounts.

11:51.861 --> 11:54.193
Has Dr. Bishop been able
to make a positive ID yet?

11:54.363 --> 11:56.729
No. Contact the bank,
see what they can tell us.

11:56.899 --> 12:00.528
Done. Back of the file
are Bowman's U.S. clients.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.172
He outdid himself this time.

12:08.344 --> 12:10.369
He's gonna get impatient to sell it off.

12:10.546 --> 12:14.004
So you have to get the money
lined up fast.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.715
What?

12:18.888 --> 12:21.152
Olivia, you okay?

12:21.891 --> 12:23.358
People, we got something.

12:23.526 --> 12:25.653
Simmons, patch me in
through public address.

12:25.828 --> 12:29.559
Wilson sent over the black-box recording.
Last 60 seconds of the flight.

12:29.732 --> 12:31.063
Play it.

12:31.233 --> 12:33.428
New York Center,
this is VertusAir 718 heavy.

12:33.602 --> 12:35.229
We have a report that there...

12:36.605 --> 12:40.564
Tower to VertusAir 718.
Other aircraft calling. Say again.

12:41.410 --> 12:44.243
Purser's reporting a disturbance
in the main cabin. There...

12:45.614 --> 12:47.047
It's trying to get in.

12:47.216 --> 12:49.343
New York, we need an emergency...

12:49.518 --> 12:52.214
718... We have something onboard.

12:52.388 --> 12:54.356
It's already killed at least three...

12:54.523 --> 12:55.785
God. Hold that back.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.364
That's it. Tech is trying to recover more.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.434
Let's get back to work, people.

13:07.603 --> 13:08.900
Charlie.

13:09.071 --> 13:10.902
Come here a second.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.540
See this guy?

13:13.709 --> 13:18.043
Daniel Hicks. He owns an import-export
company based in Chelsea.

13:18.214 --> 13:21.047
He's the guy that Marshall Bowman
was flying in to meet.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.345
So we need to bring him in
for questioning.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.082
This your gut again?

13:30.359 --> 13:32.725
What's going on, Liv?

13:37.466 --> 13:40.230
This is gonna sound insane.
Let's just put it in the category...

13:40.402 --> 13:42.597
...of "crazy things happen
in Walter Bishop's lab."

13:43.239 --> 13:44.365
Okay.

13:47.443 --> 13:49.968
John Scott and I
shared consciousness.

13:52.248 --> 13:56.776
Our minds were connected through
a procedure before he died.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.415
Some of his memories
are still in my head.

14:00.589 --> 14:03.319
- His memories.
- And sometimes I get flashes.

14:03.492 --> 14:06.120
I see what he saw in the memory.

14:06.295 --> 14:10.129
In one of these flashes I saw him
with Marshall Bowman.

14:10.299 --> 14:13.826
And this guy. Hicks.
I think they were all working together.

14:14.003 --> 14:15.937
- On what?
- I don't know.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.539
A weapon sale of some kind.

14:21.143 --> 14:23.771
Okay. I'll bring him in.

14:24.947 --> 14:25.971
That's it?

14:26.148 --> 14:29.640
Despite the thousand questions
I have in my head right now...

14:29.919 --> 14:31.819
...I'm gonna bite my tongue.

14:34.156 --> 14:35.418
Thank you.

14:42.064 --> 14:44.396
- Bishop's house of horrors.
- Hey. How we doing?

14:44.567 --> 14:48.025
Good. We got the blood work back.
You were right. It is Marshall Bowman.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.699
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

14:50.873 --> 14:53.706
Walter seems to think he was dosed
with some kind of designer virus.

14:53.876 --> 14:54.900
So it was intentional.

14:55.077 --> 14:57.705
Hard to say it was an accident.
Stuff doesn't exist in nature.

14:57.880 --> 15:01.213
Whoever did it would have a deep
understanding of cutting-edge genetics.

15:01.383 --> 15:03.681
I mean, it completely rewrote
Bowman's DNA.

15:03.852 --> 15:07.185
If the plane hadn't crashed, he wouldn't
have survived the transformation.

15:07.356 --> 15:10.484
There's something else,
under the heading of "What the hell?"

15:10.659 --> 15:14.527
But we found something in his left hand.
Here, I'll stream it to you.

15:15.898 --> 15:18.230
It's a glass disk
about the size of a nickel.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.694
I don't believe it.

15:22.871 --> 15:26.068
We found a similar disk
on the DEA agent a few months back.

15:26.241 --> 15:28.334
I thought you told me
Bowman was a banker.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.671
Now you're telling me
he's some kind of agent?

15:30.846 --> 15:35.078
I don't know. Charlie's bringing in a guy
who might be able to give us answers.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.844
Tell us about your business, Mr. Hicks.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.113
My business.

15:40.789 --> 15:43.087
It's import and export.

15:43.492 --> 15:46.461
But you know that already.
You just came from my office.

15:46.629 --> 15:48.722
Why don't you indulge us, Mr. Hicks?

15:49.732 --> 15:51.859
What do you import and export?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.365
Furniture, mostly.

15:53.535 --> 15:55.730
Mostly French, 18th and 19th century.

15:55.904 --> 15:59.271
Look, I'd like to know
what this is all about.

15:59.441 --> 16:01.636
I run a clean business.

16:01.810 --> 16:03.710
How do you know Marshall Bowman?

16:03.879 --> 16:06.609
He's my banker, overseas.

16:06.782 --> 16:08.943
Why, has he gotten
into some kind of trouble?

16:09.118 --> 16:11.245
This is wonderful, don't you agree?

16:11.420 --> 16:13.752
It's just like a good detective movie.

16:13.922 --> 16:15.890
Mr. Hicks.

16:16.258 --> 16:18.385
Have you heard what happened
on Flight 718?

16:18.560 --> 16:21.825
Yeah, that's the plane
that crashed, right?

16:22.131 --> 16:23.564
Mm-hm.

16:23.899 --> 16:28.598
This may be hard to recognize,
but this is Marshall Bowman.

16:28.771 --> 16:31.103
He was onboard that plane.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.973
I... I...

16:37.146 --> 16:38.408
I don't understand.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.811
I believe you do, Mr. Hicks.
I believe you know how that happened.

16:41.984 --> 16:45.920
I believe that you and Marshall Bowman
conspired to distribute a deadly virus...

16:46.088 --> 16:48.488
...and this is the unintended result.

16:50.959 --> 16:55.487
Look, I think you have me mistaken
for someone else.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.292
Your nose is bleeding.

16:59.835 --> 17:02.201
Can we have a box of tissues, please?

17:03.572 --> 17:05.061
No.

17:05.307 --> 17:07.104
No, tissues won't help.

17:07.675 --> 17:09.666
Get me some sedatives. Now.

17:09.845 --> 17:11.574
I need help.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.685
Walter, what's happening?

17:18.854 --> 17:22.517
I suspect the same thing that happened
to that man in the airplane.

17:26.662 --> 17:28.561
I may be able to suspend the process.

17:28.731 --> 17:31.325
No, not yet. Not until he talks.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.663
- Please.
- You want help? I want answers.

17:35.838 --> 17:40.332
We must have been dosed.

17:40.509 --> 17:42.602
I wanna know the name. Who dosed you?

17:44.513 --> 17:45.980
Conrad.

17:54.957 --> 17:57.118
Oh, I don't think that's working.

18:18.614 --> 18:20.411
I checked the DHS database.

18:20.582 --> 18:24.882
Nothing on a Conrad first or last name
when cross-referenced with Daniel Hicks.

18:25.053 --> 18:28.250
Well, so far there's no mention
of a Conrad in John's old files either.

18:28.423 --> 18:29.890
Hmm.

18:30.092 --> 18:32.287
Why don't you let me take a turn?

18:33.462 --> 18:35.123
Thank you.

18:38.066 --> 18:40.330
- Anything?
- Yes.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.994
As often is the case,
there's good news and bad news.

18:44.173 --> 18:48.234
He is transforming, but I placed him in a
medically induced coma to slow the process.

18:48.410 --> 18:50.241
- Which is that, the good or the bad?
- Huh?

18:50.445 --> 18:53.608
- Which is it, the good news or the bad?
- That's the bad news.

18:53.782 --> 18:56.478
The good news
is that I have already synthesized...

18:56.652 --> 18:58.847
...a preliminary sample of an antidote.

18:59.054 --> 19:02.990
I'm testing it on tissue samples
as we speak. And a watermelon.

19:04.459 --> 19:05.824
As a control group.

19:06.195 --> 19:07.526
And will it be ready in time?

19:07.696 --> 19:09.391
Depends on your definition of time.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.625
If you mean
before he turns into a beast...

19:13.802 --> 19:15.360
...I wouldn't wager on it, no.

19:16.438 --> 19:18.167
Wonderful.

19:27.382 --> 19:28.872
Cut open his hand.

19:30.152 --> 19:32.814
- What?
- I wanna see if there's a disk in it.

19:32.988 --> 19:34.319
Like Bowman's.

19:34.489 --> 19:35.683
I like cutting.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.636
- Where did you get these?
- One of them was in Bowman's palm.

19:48.804 --> 19:52.399
The other one was on Hicks.
We've seen one of these before.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.008
Did the NSA ever determine
what it was for?

19:55.177 --> 19:58.977
A data-storage device.
Apparently used to transport information.

20:01.183 --> 20:03.811
I want authorization
to exhume John Scott's body.

20:03.986 --> 20:05.010
John Scott?

20:05.187 --> 20:07.052
I think he may have one on him too.

20:07.222 --> 20:10.385
I think he was working
with Bowman and Hicks.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.760
- I'm afraid that won't be possible.
- Make it possible.

20:13.929 --> 20:15.863
- Excuse me.
- Look, I know it's against protocol...

20:16.031 --> 20:17.498
...but I don't give a damn.
- Stop.

20:17.666 --> 20:20.760
- If you don't ask Harris, I'll ask myself.
- I said, stop.

20:27.376 --> 20:28.934
You can't dig up John Scott's body.

20:29.111 --> 20:32.945
And that other disk,
it didn't go to the NSA.

20:35.550 --> 20:37.415
Where did it go?

20:40.889 --> 20:43.858
One advantage of being the
Defense Department's biggest contractor:

20:44.026 --> 20:46.688
Massive Dynamic has money
to develop technologies...

20:46.862 --> 20:48.989
...generations beyond that
of the U.S. government.

20:49.164 --> 20:52.395
When we were unable to retrieve
the information, I requested Nina's help.

20:52.567 --> 20:56.469
I suspect you telling me this
isn't the only reason we're here.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.572
Agent Dunham.

20:59.775 --> 21:01.208
Ms. Sharp.

21:01.977 --> 21:06.243
For what it's worth, it was not
my decision to keep this from you.

21:35.644 --> 21:38.772
As you suspected, we discovered
a disk identical to the others...

21:38.947 --> 21:40.608
...embedded in Agent Scott's hand.

21:42.718 --> 21:47.018
While he may appear to be alive,
I assure you he is not.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.122
We've kept him in a suspended state...

21:51.293 --> 21:54.421
...because we believe that
the information stored in the disks...

21:54.596 --> 21:57.190
...self-destructs
when the disk's host dies.

21:57.366 --> 22:01.302
We attempted to utilize
Agent Scott's body...

22:01.470 --> 22:05.031
...his blood, his DNA,
to try to retrieve the data.

22:05.240 --> 22:09.267
The small amount of information
we were able to gather...

22:10.278 --> 22:16.513
...seems to implicate Agent Scott
as part of a bioterrorist cell.

22:20.555 --> 22:23.285
There were also references to a Conrad.

22:23.458 --> 22:24.891
We believe he's a scientist.

22:25.060 --> 22:28.496
Designing chemical and biological
weapons for sale on the black market.

22:28.663 --> 22:31.496
CIA's received scattered intel
on him in the past.

22:31.666 --> 22:34.567
Nothing concrete.
We don't even know his full name.

22:36.505 --> 22:38.666
So a plane full of people are dead...

22:38.840 --> 22:42.003
...and our best lead is nothing?

22:42.177 --> 22:44.907
A chemist whose name
we don't even know.

22:45.847 --> 22:47.712
It gets worse.

22:48.683 --> 22:51.243
Three hours ago,
French intelligence relayed to D.C...

22:51.420 --> 22:55.254
...an informant claims a major weapon sale
is about to go down in Chicago.

22:55.424 --> 22:57.984
However, what the informant
was unable to say...

22:58.160 --> 23:01.755
...is exactly where or when
the sale is going to take place.

23:01.930 --> 23:08.199
What the informant did know is that the
man behind the sale is known as Conrad.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.901
- Hello?
- I'm on my way back. Is Walter there?

23:15.077 --> 23:16.408
Yeah, why?

23:16.578 --> 23:19.513
I just got word that Conrad's
planning on selling this virus.

23:19.681 --> 23:21.581
- What? When?
- I don't know.

23:21.750 --> 23:24.241
If I'm right and John was working
with these guys...

23:24.419 --> 23:27.616
...he has the answer. In his memory.
Which means that it's in mine.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.951
- Olivia, you know how dangerous this is.
- Tell Walter to prep the tank.

23:31.126 --> 23:32.684
I'm going back in.

23:44.306 --> 23:45.671
- You okay?
- Yeah.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.399
Be careful.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.614
We're online.

23:57.486 --> 23:59.010
All right.

24:01.223 --> 24:03.919
- Olivia. Can you hear me?
- Yes.

24:04.126 --> 24:07.061
You must listen to my voice
at all times.

24:07.229 --> 24:10.027
It is your connection,
your lifeline. Understood?

24:10.198 --> 24:12.132
Understood.

24:12.367 --> 24:16.167
I am going to try and guide you
through John Scott's memory...

24:16.338 --> 24:18.670
...in an attempt to take you back
to the place...

24:18.840 --> 24:22.241
...where he met our
comatose friend here, Mr. Hicks.

24:22.444 --> 24:24.742
Now, picture yourself...

24:25.280 --> 24:29.774
...at the top of a steep flight of stairs.

24:29.951 --> 24:33.580
As you descend, step by step...

24:33.755 --> 24:38.249
...you will become progressively
more and more relaxed.

24:39.561 --> 24:44.464
Now here come the last five steps.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.531
Four.

24:47.702 --> 24:49.431
Three.

24:49.604 --> 24:51.367
Two.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.597
One.

24:56.878 --> 25:00.041
- Where are you?
- I'm in a bedroom.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.943
No, it's not a bedroom.

25:08.590 --> 25:11.923
This is where we used to meet.
John and I.

25:29.277 --> 25:31.404
Oh, man. This is crazy.

25:31.580 --> 25:35.516
- Absolutely. This'll never happen again.
- No, never.

25:38.353 --> 25:41.117
- Ask her what she sees.
- What do you see?

25:42.490 --> 25:44.117
Me and John.

25:44.359 --> 25:49.126
Don't worry, he can't see you.
Remember, you're observing a memory.

25:51.433 --> 25:53.424
I'll be right back.

26:11.653 --> 26:12.779
Hey, Liv.

26:14.756 --> 26:16.189
Olivia, what's happening?

26:19.327 --> 26:22.194
- John's talking to me.
- That's not possible, Olivia.

26:22.364 --> 26:23.888
He can't see you.

26:26.167 --> 26:29.864
We'll try to take you elsewhere,
where John and his accomplices met.

26:34.376 --> 26:36.173
- Don't move.
- Liv, what's wrong?

26:36.344 --> 26:39.905
Stop. Don't. Don't move.

26:40.081 --> 26:44.381
Olivia, focus on the sound of my voice.

26:44.819 --> 26:47.185
I said stay there.

26:48.056 --> 26:51.822
- I miss you.
- Don't move.

26:56.531 --> 26:59.523
I'm gonna ask you a question,
you're gonna give me the answer.

26:59.701 --> 27:02.568
You were working
with a man named Conrad.

27:02.737 --> 27:05.763
He developed a biological weapon.
I wanna know who he is...

27:05.940 --> 27:08.704
...and who he's planning on selling it to.

27:09.344 --> 27:12.279
- Liv, put the gun...
- Stop lying to me, John.

27:12.447 --> 27:16.178
I know you were part of a terrorist cell.
We have your partner in custody.

27:16.351 --> 27:19.377
Hicks, he's dying.
And Bowman is already dead.

27:20.021 --> 27:22.285
They were infected
with some kind of a virus.

27:22.457 --> 27:24.425
- Liv...
- No!

27:26.328 --> 27:29.195
- What just happened?
- I don't know.

27:29.364 --> 27:31.889
We need to get her out.
We need to get her out, now.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.797
It's too dangerous. She's too far in.

27:34.969 --> 27:38.097
We need to reconnect
before we pull her out.

27:38.273 --> 27:41.208
Olivia, can you hear me?

27:42.243 --> 27:43.938
Olivia.

27:45.613 --> 27:48.776
Olivia, can you hear me? Olivia?

28:14.709 --> 28:16.176
Walter?

28:24.452 --> 28:26.181
Olivia.

28:34.095 --> 28:36.029
I want answers, John.

28:55.917 --> 28:57.111
There he is.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.184
- Who?
- Conrad.

29:02.791 --> 29:05.760
He's a monster, Liv.
Capable of creating horrible things...

29:05.927 --> 29:09.021
...weapons which he does for
no other reason than because he can.

29:09.197 --> 29:12.462
Because he's curious.
And he sells them to the highest bidder.

29:13.535 --> 29:15.059
That's him.

29:15.670 --> 29:16.864
And that's me.

29:18.540 --> 29:22.306
The problem was we were hunting a man
none of us had ever seen before.

29:22.477 --> 29:26.641
If I had known I had him in my sights,
I could've taken him out right there.

29:26.815 --> 29:30.512
It was my most important mission
and I failed.

29:30.685 --> 29:33.347
I let that monster get away.

29:34.222 --> 29:36.349
I didn't know it was him.

29:37.892 --> 29:39.826
What mission?

29:41.095 --> 29:43.359
Who were you working for?

29:54.375 --> 29:56.434
Bowman and Hicks.

29:57.846 --> 30:04.217
The truth is they were,
they are, government agents.

30:04.385 --> 30:06.853
NSA, a secret task force.

30:09.424 --> 30:10.914
And so was I.

30:11.359 --> 30:12.758
I don't believe you.

30:12.927 --> 30:15.293
- It's the truth, Liv.
- No, not again.

30:15.497 --> 30:18.295
If you want me to believe you,
you need to prove it to me.

30:18.500 --> 30:21.367
I can't. Liv, it's black ops,
a deniable operation.

30:21.536 --> 30:25.563
If we're to take out Conrad, there can
be no record of our involvement.

30:25.740 --> 30:29.232
That's why I could never tell you,
even though I wanted to.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.207
If that's the truth, then help me.

30:31.379 --> 30:34.439
- Tell me where the sale's going down.
- What sale?

30:34.616 --> 30:37.949
The virus. We believe
that Conrad's planning on selling it.

30:38.119 --> 30:40.917
I don't know what's going on
inside Conrad's organization.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.580
Hicks would know.
You need to talk to Hicks.

30:43.758 --> 30:45.385
He was privy to that information.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.994
- He has it...
- John?

30:48.162 --> 30:51.563
- John?
- Liv, trust Hicks.

30:51.733 --> 30:53.291
He can help you.

30:54.569 --> 30:56.662
John? John?

30:57.805 --> 30:59.432
- John?
- We have to pull her out.

30:59.908 --> 31:02.468
- John?
- Prepare 30 cc's of dextroamphetamine.

31:14.689 --> 31:17.522
- Hi, Peter.
- You're okay.

31:17.692 --> 31:19.853
You're gonna be fine.

31:22.931 --> 31:26.128
I understand. Thanks for checking.

31:27.802 --> 31:30.828
My contact at NSA couldn't confirm
a single thing John said.

31:31.005 --> 31:33.166
Of course.
John said they wouldn't be able to.

31:33.341 --> 31:36.003
That's the perfect alibi,
one that you can't confirm.

31:36.578 --> 31:39.513
Yeah. How's it coming?

31:39.681 --> 31:43.276
His cell sample's membranes
still aren't absorbing the inhibiter.

31:44.352 --> 31:46.650
We don't know
if the antidote's working yet.

31:48.656 --> 31:51.853
But it might. We could try it and see.

31:52.026 --> 31:55.723
You wanna wake up Hicks, even though
he could transform just like Bowman did?

31:55.897 --> 31:59.731
Conrad could be selling this virus. Hicks
can tell us how this is gonna go down.

31:59.901 --> 32:03.393
And you're willing to take John's word
that you can trust Hicks?

32:04.105 --> 32:06.130
It finally happened.

32:06.307 --> 32:09.208
I'm now referring to a dead guy
who exists only in your mind.

32:09.377 --> 32:14.974
Boy. I need another bag
of midazolam right away.

32:15.149 --> 32:17.709
What if he's still lying to you?

32:17.885 --> 32:19.147
Have you considered that?

32:20.355 --> 32:23.586
If Hicks and John
were working with Conrad...

32:23.758 --> 32:27.319
...then maybe John
is using you to tip Conrad off.

32:27.495 --> 32:30.157
Or even worse, to get you killed.

32:30.331 --> 32:32.925
This is a bad idea, Olivia.

32:37.271 --> 32:41.037
My mother always says I stick my nose
in places it does not belong.

32:45.546 --> 32:47.776
I know we haven't known
each other that long...

32:47.949 --> 32:52.079
...but you are one of the best judges
of character I've ever met.

32:52.553 --> 32:57.388
What's your instinct?

32:58.860 --> 33:02.762
When you were with John,
when you were looking into his eyes...

33:02.930 --> 33:05.160
...was he for real?

33:20.381 --> 33:22.440
Prep Hicks.

33:22.617 --> 33:25.279
Ready or not,
we're administering the antidote.

33:25.453 --> 33:28.581
An experiment. How exhilarating.

33:29.223 --> 33:32.920
This is Agent Dunham.
I need to talk to Broyles.

33:46.407 --> 33:48.341
Sorry to wake you.

33:49.243 --> 33:54.306
Little worse than adrenaline except,
perhaps, lice, which is a nightmare.

33:55.883 --> 33:58.283
Mr. Hicks, try and breathe normally.

33:58.453 --> 33:59.943
Can you hear me?

34:00.121 --> 34:05.184
This is an antidote. While I can't
guarantee it will actually work...

34:05.359 --> 34:07.919
...I do have a recorded IQ of...

34:08.096 --> 34:10.929
- One-ninety-six.
- Really?

34:11.099 --> 34:13.659
We know about the work
you were doing with John Scott.

34:16.103 --> 34:18.163
Now we need your help.

34:18.706 --> 34:20.172
For those not in the know...

34:20.341 --> 34:22.935
...information has come to us
about a weapons buy.

34:23.110 --> 34:27.605
The same virus
responsible for Flight 718.

34:27.982 --> 34:30.643
I know this label gets slapped
on pretty much all we do...

34:30.818 --> 34:34.618
...but preventing this transaction
from taking place is our highest priority.

34:34.789 --> 34:38.054
The prospective buyer landed
in the United States this morning...

34:38.226 --> 34:41.217
...0700 hours, O'Hare Airport,
and we were there.

34:41.395 --> 34:44.125
That suspect is now in custody,
and no surprise to anyone...

34:44.297 --> 34:45.697
...refuses to cooperate.

34:45.867 --> 34:47.858
But we do have someone else in custody:

34:48.034 --> 34:51.869
An informant with extensive information
on the players we'll be dealing with.

34:52.039 --> 34:54.803
His name is Daniel Hicks,
and he has agreed to relay...

34:54.976 --> 34:57.240
...all necessary information
to Agent Dunham...

34:57.411 --> 34:59.879
...using an encrypted,
untraceable two-way radio...

35:00.047 --> 35:01.844
...which we implanted this afternoon.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.041
Agent Francis
will coordinate surveillance.

35:04.218 --> 35:07.244
The informant disclosed the meet
is scheduled for 1600 hours...

35:07.421 --> 35:09.821
...at the Fairchild Hotel, Room 1021.

35:09.991 --> 35:12.687
The seller, a man known as Conrad,
will not be there...

35:12.860 --> 35:14.418
...but his intermediaries will.

35:14.629 --> 35:17.996
We have agents standing by to move in
in corresponding rooms.

35:18.166 --> 35:20.999
Per regulations, no raid will be ordered...

35:21.169 --> 35:23.399
...until Agent Dunham
has visual on the weapon.

35:23.571 --> 35:26.062
When she does,
she'll give the go signal.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.502
- That signal will be?
- "Christmas."

35:29.677 --> 35:32.908
We all look forward to see how
she works that into conversation.

35:34.282 --> 35:36.216
Okay, people. Let's get it done.

36:07.281 --> 36:10.079
Listen up. Spotted the seller.

36:17.491 --> 36:21.052
The seller is making a phone call.
Stand by.

36:22.063 --> 36:24.156
You didn't have to come with me,
you know.

36:24.332 --> 36:27.563
Shady deals with shady guys
in shady hotels is my m.o.

36:28.135 --> 36:31.127
Typically, if someone is gonna kill you,
it's a good idea...

36:31.305 --> 36:33.637
...to have an ally in the room.
- I'm not scared.

36:33.808 --> 36:36.641
Being fearless
doesn't mean you're being safe.

36:41.015 --> 36:43.006
- Astrid, how are we doing?
- Hey.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.445
Hicks is onboard and ready to go.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.952
I'm putting you on speaker.

36:48.522 --> 36:52.356
So far, so good, Olivia.
Blood pressure 140/90, not bad...

36:52.526 --> 36:55.324
...considering 3 cc's of adrenaline.

36:55.496 --> 36:57.327
Are they gonna expect bona fides?

36:57.765 --> 37:01.360
- Hicks, tell me what I need to know.
- Well, they're gonna be suspicious.

37:01.535 --> 37:03.264
Why they've never seen you before.

37:03.437 --> 37:05.803
You tell them you used to work
with Anderson.

37:05.973 --> 37:07.770
Anderson, okay, got it. What else?

37:07.942 --> 37:10.172
Tell them Ernesto
flew in for the meeting...

37:10.344 --> 37:13.336
...but he got called back
to the basement and he couldn't come.

37:13.514 --> 37:15.277
What? Called back to the basement?

37:15.449 --> 37:17.144
Just say it, he'll understand.

37:17.818 --> 37:19.547
You're not messing with me, are you?

37:19.754 --> 37:22.052
You trusted John Scott, right?

37:23.257 --> 37:25.248
Then trust me.

37:26.327 --> 37:29.694
He's on the move.
Seller's heading inside.

37:35.403 --> 37:37.496
That's him. Here we go.

37:43.411 --> 37:46.812
Liv, you be careful.

37:49.917 --> 37:53.353
You're Gavin.
Susan, I used to work with Anderson.

38:00.494 --> 38:01.927
I was expecting someone else.

38:03.331 --> 38:07.734
Ernesto flew in, but he was called back
to the basement, so he couldn't make it.

38:09.570 --> 38:11.231
Who's he?

38:12.006 --> 38:13.871
Who are they?

38:15.109 --> 38:16.872
We'll sweep you and get to business.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.073
Good.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.600
She's clean.

38:49.243 --> 38:51.143
The money, please.

39:00.988 --> 39:02.979
Just a formality, I assure you.

39:03.391 --> 39:05.416
It will only take a moment.

39:11.432 --> 39:13.662
Have we met before? You look familiar.

39:13.868 --> 39:16.302
- Did you work with Anderson too?
- He's testing you.

39:16.470 --> 39:20.839
You tell him Peter met Anderson
at New College at Oxford.

39:21.008 --> 39:24.944
They met at Oxford. New College.
Isn't that right?

39:25.112 --> 39:27.603
What does it matter to you
where I met anyone?

39:29.784 --> 39:31.081
Where did you meet, on campus?

39:31.252 --> 39:34.244
Where they met?
I'm sorry, I don't know that.

39:34.422 --> 39:36.083
I don't know where exactly it was.

39:40.694 --> 39:44.653
We met at the White Horse
on Wheatley Road. You know it?

39:45.633 --> 39:46.895
I don't recall.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.496
You would. Thai food, it's fantastic.

39:49.670 --> 39:53.037
I could tell you what each of us
was wearing if you want to hear it.

39:53.207 --> 39:55.698
Where the hell did he come up with that?

39:55.910 --> 39:57.605
I have no idea.

40:00.948 --> 40:02.108
It's all here.

40:05.119 --> 40:06.518
Have a seat.

40:09.356 --> 40:12.723
I have to admit,
I was skeptical that you'd come at all.

40:12.927 --> 40:15.361
Well, of course we came.

40:15.796 --> 40:17.855
I thought it would be Paris
all over again.

40:18.032 --> 40:21.331
That was because of the French
intelligence report and he knows it.

40:21.502 --> 40:25.996
That was because of the French
intelligence report. You know that.

40:30.144 --> 40:31.475
True.

40:31.946 --> 40:33.641
But this is a larger purchase.

40:49.029 --> 40:50.690
Hello?

40:51.332 --> 40:52.731
Okay.

40:54.735 --> 40:57.329
Conrad would like to see you.

40:58.539 --> 41:00.905
- When?
- Now.

41:01.075 --> 41:03.066
He's on his way.

41:06.847 --> 41:09.577
What's going on?
Do they have the package?

41:09.750 --> 41:12.116
- Why isn't she calling the raid?
- Conrad's coming.

41:12.286 --> 41:14.846
- So what?
- So she doesn't wanna scare him off.

41:15.022 --> 41:16.683
She wants to get him.

41:18.492 --> 41:20.460
She's waiting for Conrad.

41:20.628 --> 41:22.596
We've included this with the purchase.

41:23.731 --> 41:26.427
It's a reverse-mutator. An antidote.

41:26.600 --> 41:29.728
It would take you years
to reverse-engineer an antivirus.

41:29.904 --> 41:32.236
It's why the purchase price is so high.

41:32.406 --> 41:35.239
The formula itself
is deceiving in its complexity.

41:35.409 --> 41:36.740
We shouldn't have a need for that.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.379
It's only in case of accidental exposure.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.779
Which, I assure you, would be fatal.

41:46.453 --> 41:50.753
Now, why wouldn't Ernesto
call me back himself...

41:50.925 --> 41:53.155
...and tell me someone else
was coming to meet?

41:58.299 --> 41:59.994
Uh-oh.

42:00.167 --> 42:01.634
Oh, God.

42:01.802 --> 42:03.099
A tranquilizer, quick.

42:03.270 --> 42:06.296
It's happening to him.
Hicks is transforming.

42:06.473 --> 42:07.770
Well?

42:07.942 --> 42:10.934
Well, how would I know?
I'm not Ernesto's mother.

42:11.111 --> 42:13.102
At least tell me who he was meeting.

42:19.420 --> 42:21.320
Quickly. Quickly.

42:21.555 --> 42:23.250
What the hell is going on?

42:28.495 --> 42:31.953
I asked you a simple question.

42:32.333 --> 42:34.301
Who was Ernesto meeting?

42:34.468 --> 42:37.631
I need a name. Somebody,
anybody else in your operation.

42:38.872 --> 42:43.138
Oh, no. Oh, God. Hicks is out.

42:51.318 --> 42:55.846
I'll ask you again.
Who was your colleague meeting?

43:02.596 --> 43:04.029
Sir, should we move in?

43:09.903 --> 43:12.371
Okay. That's enough.
Now, just tell him. Tell him.

43:12.539 --> 43:14.734
I'm not getting greased
over Ernesto's secret.

43:14.908 --> 43:16.136
What secret is that?

43:16.310 --> 43:17.971
- Shut your mouth.
- Ernesto is sick.

43:18.145 --> 43:21.512
He's dying sick, okay?
He just doesn't want anybody to know.

43:21.682 --> 43:24.515
Damn it, Liv. Give the signal.

43:24.685 --> 43:28.314
- What is wrong with you? He asked...
- I got a gun in my face.

43:28.489 --> 43:29.513
Both of you, shut up!

43:29.690 --> 43:32.124
- Get that out of my face, I'm telling you.
- Gavin.

43:34.728 --> 43:38.755
- Who are these people?
- According to them, Ernesto's sick.

43:40.534 --> 43:42.263
It's true.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.898
He found out the day before Christmas.

43:47.374 --> 43:49.239
I spoke to Ernesto this morning.

43:54.081 --> 43:56.777
He's fine. Kill them both right now.

44:00.154 --> 44:03.851
FBI! Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!

44:04.024 --> 44:05.616
Hands on the table. Get down.

44:05.793 --> 44:08.694
Get your face down! Nobody move!

44:09.563 --> 44:10.894
- Check the other room.
- Stay down!

44:11.065 --> 44:12.896
Put your hands behind your back.

44:14.535 --> 44:17.026
John Scott says hi.

44:20.774 --> 44:24.972
Turns out Conrad's a French citizen.
Conrad Etienne Moreau.

44:25.179 --> 44:28.546
Wanted in connection with at least
half a dozen biological attacks.

44:28.716 --> 44:30.911
Those are just the ones we know about.

44:31.552 --> 44:33.713
He's been manufacturing
biological weapons...

44:33.887 --> 44:36.481
...and distributing them
on the black market for years.

44:37.424 --> 44:39.187
And you caught him.

44:40.227 --> 44:43.993
I would think you could at least
let yourself crack a smile about that.

44:45.833 --> 44:47.960
I didn't do it alone.

44:52.106 --> 44:56.600
You know, despite the successful
outcome of this case...

44:56.777 --> 44:59.007
...John Scott's status remains the same.

45:01.582 --> 45:04.983
As far as this department is concerned,
he was a traitor.

45:05.719 --> 45:07.710
Even if he was telling the truth...

45:08.155 --> 45:09.986
...there's no way to confirm it.

45:11.291 --> 45:12.849
That's all right.

45:14.661 --> 45:16.856
I know the truth.

45:17.231 --> 45:18.630
And that's enough.

45:30.244 --> 45:31.609
Hello?

45:33.680 --> 45:35.375
Anyone here?

45:53.667 --> 45:55.032
Agent Dunham?

45:55.803 --> 45:57.202
Where is everyone?

45:57.371 --> 46:01.239
They took that gentleman
that was here to the hospital to recover.

46:01.408 --> 46:03.740
- So the antidote worked.
- He started improving...

46:03.911 --> 46:06.812
...almost as soon as I administered it.

46:07.481 --> 46:11.247
Which is more than I can say
for my own concoction.

46:11.418 --> 46:14.353
In any case, I was just about to read
a bedtime story.

46:14.521 --> 46:16.079
Walter.

46:17.057 --> 46:19.525
I was hoping you'd do me a favor.

46:24.031 --> 46:29.059
Even if you did go back in,
I'm dubious you'd even be able to find him.

46:29.236 --> 46:30.328
What do you mean?

46:30.504 --> 46:33.496
Your brain-wave patterns
are returning to normal.

46:34.007 --> 46:39.570
Your mind is finally succeeding
in purging itself of Agent Scott.

46:40.314 --> 46:45.342
Even if you could reconnect, it would
be for seconds, minutes at best.

46:45.519 --> 46:48.545
And then you would never see him again.

46:48.722 --> 46:50.883
Then we need to do this now.

47:25.792 --> 47:28.090
It's beautiful out here, isn't it?

47:43.944 --> 47:45.741
We caught him today.

47:46.613 --> 47:49.081
- Conrad.
- Really?

47:52.953 --> 47:55.421
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

47:56.023 --> 47:57.923
I should've trusted you.

47:58.091 --> 48:00.184
No, it wasn't your fault.

48:02.296 --> 48:04.594
I always meant to tell you.

48:05.532 --> 48:07.693
I guess I ran out of time.

48:14.541 --> 48:16.702
There was one other thing.

48:33.360 --> 48:36.227
I know we can't ever be together.

48:36.430 --> 48:37.920
Not really.

48:42.936 --> 48:45.131
Maybe I won't know the difference.

49:10.697 --> 49:12.597
I love you, Liv.

49:24.011 --> 49:26.002
I love you too.
