WEBVTT

00:24.814 --> 00:26.916
Been doin'
some readin' sugar plum.

00:26.948 --> 00:30.919
My boy got ahold of your private
electronic correspondence.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.989
Mm, slanderous stuff.

00:34.023 --> 00:37.626
All pointin' fingers
and wild accusations.

00:37.660 --> 00:39.863
The last confined
gasps of a little girl

00:39.895 --> 00:44.901
who could not cope with failure,
with ruination.

00:46.202 --> 00:48.437
Consider this your
invitation to the death march

00:48.471 --> 00:51.440
of Gigi Cutler,
Queen of California.

00:52.141 --> 00:54.911
Houston City, Wednesday week.

00:54.943 --> 00:56.111
We'll provide the
golden parachute.

00:56.145 --> 00:58.648
All you've gotta do is jump.

00:59.882 --> 01:04.553
Between you and me, I'm just
plain tickled to see it.

01:04.587 --> 01:05.187
Bye bye now.

01:20.035 --> 01:22.538
Is that Gigi Cutler?

01:25.040 --> 01:25.875
Yep.

01:27.510 --> 01:28.710
- Lookie here.
- Who do we have?

01:28.743 --> 01:31.915
Just walked
up,.

01:31.948 --> 01:33.750
Shore Oil and Gas,
how can I help you?

01:33.782 --> 01:36.052
Oh.

01:50.999 --> 01:51.934
Lookie here at this
piece of shit like you.

02:11.921 --> 02:14.056
Gigi, lovin' the tie.

02:16.225 --> 02:18.261
He had to tie it on in Texas.

02:18.293 --> 02:20.929
Aw, honey you got some smut,

02:20.963 --> 02:24.267
you got a little
spunk there on you.

02:25.701 --> 02:28.905
Consider yourself
lucky it's just tuna.

02:28.937 --> 02:31.607
Folks around here get fiery.

02:31.641 --> 02:33.942
Not 300 miles away
is where what's

02:33.976 --> 02:36.012
his face got shot in the melon.

02:36.044 --> 02:37.913
Who is that?

02:37.947 --> 02:38.782
JFK.

02:39.882 --> 02:43.052
Culled like a veal calf for
his premature ambitions.

02:43.084 --> 02:46.022
I'll say this much for
LBJ, that swingin' dick

02:46.054 --> 02:49.124
could not abide whipper
snappers.

02:49.157 --> 02:52.095
Now you've been gunnin'
after my gig, Gigi.

02:52.127 --> 02:54.064
You mighta had it, too.

02:55.263 --> 02:59.101
Risin' star, young
blood, lady parts.

02:59.135 --> 03:01.770
Whipper snapper.

03:01.804 --> 03:02.805
Lucky then the
board's gonna save

03:02.838 --> 03:05.041
me the trouble of pullin' an LBJ

03:05.073 --> 03:07.743
and havin' to pop a
bullet in your brain pan.

03:07.776 --> 03:09.077
Gentlemen?

03:09.111 --> 03:11.947
Enjoy your last ride
through Dallas, baby.

03:11.981 --> 03:14.150
Won't be in a convertible.

03:14.183 --> 03:17.721
Now Gigi, I believe
you know the boys.

03:18.821 --> 03:19.823
Gentlemen.

03:21.023 --> 03:23.293
Miss Cutler, we are
gathered here today

03:23.326 --> 03:27.130
to ascertain how you
came to lose so much

03:27.162 --> 03:30.700
so quickly that we
may, God willing,

03:30.732 --> 03:32.968
avoid such losses in the future.

03:33.001 --> 03:34.036
Testify.

03:35.071 --> 03:36.806
Our losses were well within,

03:36.839 --> 03:39.876
- well within the parameters...
- Shut up!

03:39.909 --> 03:41.745
Just shut the hell up!

03:43.044 --> 03:43.946
Now, I don't know where the hell

03:43.980 --> 03:45.648
you think you are but
this is Houston City,

03:45.680 --> 03:47.183
this is win town, baby!

03:48.917 --> 03:51.921
I got a skyscraper full of
victorious sons of bitches,

03:51.953 --> 03:54.256
damn world conquerors and
they're wanderin' around

03:54.290 --> 03:56.159
like their peckers
have been cut off

03:56.191 --> 03:59.595
because mama didn't
bring home the W.

04:01.030 --> 04:03.166
Now, no excuses, G.

04:03.198 --> 04:05.901
What the Devil went
wrong out west?

04:21.750 --> 04:26.655
Gentlemen, I have come to
find the Devil has a name.

04:27.723 --> 04:29.692
God damn it, Fred!

04:29.724 --> 04:32.761
You're growin'
Elms, you're in Eden.

04:32.795 --> 04:34.364
Almonds, you're east.

04:35.930 --> 04:38.067
Central California to be exact.

04:38.099 --> 04:39.068
I said four!

04:40.402 --> 04:41.770
You did not!

04:42.738 --> 04:43.373
Four!

04:46.274 --> 04:48.678
There are 53 different
types of nuts in the world.

04:48.711 --> 04:49.879
Fred!

04:49.911 --> 04:51.179
- Son of a bitch!
- He was on of 'em.

04:51.212 --> 04:55.017
Hey, is that any way
to speak to a neighbor?

04:55.050 --> 04:56.918
You wanna know somethin'?

04:56.952 --> 04:59.322
You were never this mean
when Nancy was alive.

04:59.354 --> 05:00.756
What the hell

05:00.789 --> 05:01.224
did you just say?

05:01.257 --> 05:02.992
Hey, Wally.

05:03.024 --> 05:04.094
How's it goin'?

05:10.800 --> 05:13.136
Make him see some damn sense.

05:15.404 --> 05:17.940
Where you goin', neighbor?

05:22.211 --> 05:26.249
In the immortal words
of our illustrious leader,

05:26.281 --> 05:28.084
"Who knows the true meaning

05:28.116 --> 05:30.085
"of?"

05:33.122 --> 05:33.889
Miss Cutler,

05:33.923 --> 05:36.259
had you met the
bastard previously?

05:36.291 --> 05:38.794
The year
before it all started,

05:38.827 --> 05:41.229
at a fundraiser for
our local government.

05:41.262 --> 05:43.231
The Congressman thanks you.

05:43.264 --> 05:45.134
The
Congressman owes me.

05:58.313 --> 06:00.082
Gigi Cutler?

06:00.115 --> 06:00.916
You are?

06:00.950 --> 06:02.918
Your neighbor.

06:02.952 --> 06:05.988
Frederick Stern at my birth
and Fred to my colleagues

06:06.021 --> 06:07.290
and Freddy if it's personal,

06:07.322 --> 06:09.325
so you can call me Fred.

06:10.526 --> 06:12.095
Charmed.

06:12.127 --> 06:14.130
Are you enjoyin' this?

06:15.397 --> 06:18.267
Mm, all these fat cats and
big wigs lookin' your way,

06:18.300 --> 06:20.937
prayin' to get a
smile from Shore Oil's

06:20.969 --> 06:23.371
newly appointed representative.

06:23.404 --> 06:25.173
Do I detect a
hint of hostility?

06:25.207 --> 06:26.209
No, hell no.

06:26.241 --> 06:28.111
Just plain curiosity.

06:28.144 --> 06:31.514
Hm.

06:31.546 --> 06:33.183
Freddy.

06:34.784 --> 06:38.221
That'd be herself
wantin' another spin.

06:39.221 --> 06:42.058
Well, it's been a
hoot with you, G.

06:43.491 --> 06:45.127
Shall we my dear?

06:46.962 --> 06:48.331
- Hi, Nancy.
- Nice to see you, Sadie.

06:48.363 --> 06:49.798
Freddy.

06:51.267 --> 06:54.303
Still keepin'
it goin', huh, Santi?

06:54.336 --> 06:58.407
Someone has to,
you're always in your cave.

06:58.440 --> 07:03.279
How do you say
impertinent prick in Spanish?

07:05.281 --> 07:07.350
Nice try.

07:07.382 --> 07:10.286
You've been workin'
for me for, what?

07:10.319 --> 07:11.454
With you.

07:11.486 --> 07:14.823
- For me for what, 25 years?
- 30.

07:14.856 --> 07:16.091
You gotta have enough saved up

07:16.125 --> 07:18.394
by now to get a
patch of your own.

07:18.426 --> 07:20.428
Hell, you could probably
buy a piece of mine.

07:20.462 --> 07:21.998
You lookin' to sell?

07:22.031 --> 07:25.168
Are you makin' me an offer?

07:25.200 --> 07:26.101
For this?

07:27.202 --> 07:28.036
Hell no.

07:29.370 --> 07:31.373
- Ours was a brief exchange.
- What the hell?

07:31.406 --> 07:32.942
But you could
see it in his eyes,

07:32.974 --> 07:36.044
- And I say what the hell?
- plain as day.

07:36.077 --> 07:38.447
The hunger, the greed.

07:38.479 --> 07:39.881
Men like that spend their

07:39.914 --> 07:42.184
whole lives searchin'
for that easy money.

07:42.217 --> 07:45.587
I wouldn't
touch it without gloves.

07:45.620 --> 07:48.390
The Devil
didn't realize it yet,

07:48.423 --> 07:51.459
but he'd finally
found his in us.

08:03.238 --> 08:06.508
After you
discovered the pollution,

08:06.541 --> 08:08.276
how did you proceed?

08:08.310 --> 08:09.545
With someone desperate,

08:09.577 --> 08:11.313
someone ambitious,
morally malleable.

08:11.346 --> 08:14.049
Farm boy turned
advertising hack.

08:14.082 --> 08:15.150
Alex Gardner.

08:15.985 --> 08:17.252
Sansei Aqua.

08:17.286 --> 08:21.389
Pure as the pond, fresh
as the sushi within.

08:21.423 --> 08:22.257
Pardon?

08:23.259 --> 08:25.862
No, this is just part
of my creative process.

08:25.894 --> 08:28.296
I had this perspective
client, Sansei Aqua,

08:28.329 --> 08:30.399
top ranked Japanese themed
vitamin water brand.

08:30.432 --> 08:33.302
Hey, should I be
wearin' one of those.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.302
Yep.

08:34.335 --> 08:36.104
What?

08:36.136 --> 08:39.006
You know what this is, Alex?

08:39.041 --> 08:40.642
For every gallon
of crude oil sucked

08:40.674 --> 08:43.879
from this Earth
comes 15 gallons of?

08:45.013 --> 08:45.849
Water.

08:48.517 --> 08:50.920
No good to any living thing.

08:50.953 --> 08:52.154
What's wrong with it?

08:52.186 --> 08:54.389
Besides the fact
that it's radioactive?

08:54.422 --> 08:56.258
You're joking.

08:56.291 --> 08:58.493
Is cancer a joke?

08:58.526 --> 09:00.430
What's it doin' here?

09:01.363 --> 09:03.632
Evaporating, percolating,

09:05.467 --> 09:06.469
and it travels.

09:17.278 --> 09:19.347
Want some water?

09:19.381 --> 09:21.584
It'll rot your pipes.

09:23.051 --> 09:25.353
I know what I'm gonna
be doing tomorrow.

09:25.387 --> 09:26.488
Listen to this.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.556
"My daughter Ivanka,

09:28.589 --> 09:31.560
"will be on "Fox &
Friends" tomorrow morning.

09:31.593 --> 09:32.395
"Enjoy."

09:33.528 --> 09:35.330
I will.

09:35.363 --> 09:36.266
She's cute.

09:37.532 --> 09:38.935
How are the trees?

09:38.968 --> 09:40.336
We're gonna need some help.

09:40.368 --> 09:42.204
Are you in the market?

09:43.372 --> 09:44.507
You think I'd be sitting here

09:44.540 --> 09:47.376
with you if I could
afford a boat?

09:47.408 --> 09:49.411
So you're browsing?

09:49.445 --> 09:51.347
- Hm.
- Browsing.

09:59.488 --> 10:01.556
What are you doin' Santi?

10:04.225 --> 10:05.660
What the hell are you doin'?

10:05.694 --> 10:07.496
What?

10:07.528 --> 10:08.463
What?

10:08.497 --> 10:12.267
Why are you takin' a
picture of Nancy's...

10:14.235 --> 10:16.438
It's
been a year, Fred.

10:19.575 --> 10:22.177
Santi, Santi, I'm
sorry, I didn't...

10:29.151 --> 10:32.421
You're
too heavy!

10:32.454 --> 10:34.690
If I fall, I fall on you.

10:36.557 --> 10:38.560
Communist bastard!

10:38.594 --> 10:40.430
I'm not a communist!

10:42.430 --> 10:44.532
I'm an anarchist.

10:44.565 --> 10:46.535
Nobody knows the difference.

10:46.568 --> 10:48.371
You got your finger in my eye!

10:48.403 --> 10:50.472
Well you got your
finger in my nose.

10:51.573 --> 10:53.576
Get your finger outta my nose.

11:11.459 --> 11:13.195
I'm too old for this.

11:13.228 --> 11:14.130
Are you kiddin'?

11:14.162 --> 11:16.164
My ass so God damn heavy.

11:24.772 --> 11:25.340
Okay.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.377
Tomorrow.

11:28.410 --> 11:30.679
- Okay.
- Get outta here.

11:30.711 --> 11:32.080
Okay.

11:39.521 --> 11:41.457
You're outta beer.

11:41.489 --> 11:42.624
Out.

12:30.506 --> 12:31.507
All right.

12:34.910 --> 12:37.213
You shoot him?

12:37.246 --> 12:38.547
I shot it, I killed
it, I dressed it

12:38.579 --> 12:40.549
and I put it on my wall.

12:40.581 --> 12:42.784
Kinda kidding, I
thought that was a prop.

12:42.818 --> 12:47.623
Now, I buy your ad and you
buy Fred Stern's property.

12:51.660 --> 12:55.698
It is a win win.

12:55.730 --> 12:56.565
Why me?

12:57.733 --> 13:00.603
Alex, what I am
offering you is big.

13:02.436 --> 13:03.238
Its now.

13:04.573 --> 13:08.544
It is Royal Shore Oil.

13:09.744 --> 13:11.714
I mean, look around, huh?

13:13.748 --> 13:17.286
And Stern, well, he's
salt of the earth.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.656
He's a farmer.

13:21.690 --> 13:22.791
He's never gonna
trust my lawyers,

13:22.824 --> 13:24.526
but an old friend?

13:27.762 --> 13:29.865
And we'll be fair to him.

13:31.366 --> 13:32.868
No you won't.

13:50.752 --> 13:53.189
What do you got there?

13:55.257 --> 13:59.262
Pretty close, huh?

14:01.662 --> 14:03.565
Where the hell
did you get this?

14:03.599 --> 14:05.733
EBay.

14:05.767 --> 14:06.667
Alec Gardner.

14:06.701 --> 14:09.237
Saw him in town, he
wants to buy you dinner.

14:09.271 --> 14:09.839
Us dinner.

14:10.872 --> 14:11.607
Dinner?

14:11.640 --> 14:12.675
Yeah, sure.

14:12.708 --> 14:13.709
When?

14:14.542 --> 14:16.711
Tonight or I
can reschedule it,

14:16.744 --> 14:17.779
but it's a free dinner.

14:17.813 --> 14:20.449
No, tonight's, tonight's...

14:21.315 --> 14:22.817
Alex was always...

14:24.585 --> 14:25.720
Yeah.

14:25.753 --> 14:27.623
Okay, I'll pick
you up around six.

14:27.656 --> 14:28.791
Yeah, that's fine.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.626
That's fine.

14:30.658 --> 14:31.793
Sure, but Santi?

14:36.797 --> 14:38.666
I'll see you at six.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.735
I just said that.

14:40.768 --> 14:44.206
Yeah, well, that's
why I heard it then.

14:51.012 --> 14:53.648
Well, well, well.

14:53.681 --> 14:55.717
Santi, baby, hey.

14:55.751 --> 14:56.852
- Oh, a hug.
- Fred, what are

14:56.884 --> 14:58.319
you feedin' this big boy?

14:58.353 --> 14:59.488
- It's nice to see
- Fantastic.

14:59.521 --> 15:02.525
- you again, Sir.
- Good to see you back.

15:04.026 --> 15:05.460
Honey...

15:06.295 --> 15:07.997
Fred, Santi.

15:08.030 --> 15:10.332
Thank you, Maggie.

15:10.364 --> 15:13.768
This was 70 years
in the making, okay?

15:13.801 --> 15:15.370
A family business.

15:15.403 --> 15:17.338
Stern was never gonna sell.

15:17.372 --> 15:19.575
So, I threw him a curve.

15:19.608 --> 15:21.743
Fred, you know Gigi Cutler?

15:21.776 --> 15:23.711
Sure, she seems
like a smart lady.

15:23.744 --> 15:25.680
She is a big fan of yours,

15:25.714 --> 15:27.583
and she actually just
gave me the inside track

15:27.616 --> 15:29.018
on some offers they're gonna

15:29.050 --> 15:30.853
be makin' to
farmers around here.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.954
I asked her if I
could sound you out.

15:32.988 --> 15:35.556
Well, what would
the great Shore Oil

15:35.589 --> 15:36.825
want with the Stern's?

15:36.858 --> 15:38.993
They want your pore space.

15:39.026 --> 15:39.961
Our what?

15:39.994 --> 15:42.464
Your pore space.

15:42.497 --> 15:43.998
What's that?

15:44.031 --> 15:44.867
May I?

15:48.070 --> 15:50.539
Pancakes, that's your land.

15:52.741 --> 15:53.809
And this strawberry syrup,

15:53.842 --> 15:56.812
that's the ground water
runnin' beneath your land.

15:56.844 --> 15:59.915
Now, as you know ground water
'round here's lousy with salt.

15:59.948 --> 16:01.784
Totally useless for irrigation,

16:01.816 --> 16:03.084
just like this berry
flavored bullshit

16:03.118 --> 16:06.488
ain't fit for human consumption.

16:06.521 --> 16:10.425
This ground water,
that's gonna soak up

16:10.459 --> 16:11.627
into the lower
layers of the dirt,

16:11.660 --> 16:16.699
but the surface, the surface
is gonna remain dry, tasteless.

16:16.732 --> 16:20.502
That's why you and
everybody else around here,

16:20.535 --> 16:23.038
you gotta pipe in
the pure stuff.

16:23.070 --> 16:26.776
That doesn't exactly
answer my question.

16:29.810 --> 16:31.913
What do we have here?

16:34.648 --> 16:36.017
You see that?

16:36.050 --> 16:36.951
See this right here?

16:36.984 --> 16:38.387
Those air holes that's lettin'

16:38.420 --> 16:40.122
the syrup soak in
there good and bad?

16:40.155 --> 16:42.725
That's your pore space.

16:42.757 --> 16:46.996
And that fellas, that is
what Shore Oil wants to buy.

16:48.563 --> 16:52.335
I was buyin' a air,
space, nothing, everything.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.436
What this?

16:55.469 --> 16:56.872
These air holes?

16:56.905 --> 16:58.607
Why?

16:58.640 --> 17:02.811
Because they wanna get to the
strawberry syrup down there.

17:02.844 --> 17:04.479
That salty ass ground water,

17:04.512 --> 17:08.616
it turns out is an easy
base for hydraulic fluid.

17:08.650 --> 17:12.454
They're tellin' me 50,000 for
the whole kit and caboodle.

17:12.487 --> 17:13.121
$50,000?

17:15.957 --> 17:18.728
Why do you think I called ya?

17:19.994 --> 17:20.896
I want 70.

17:20.929 --> 17:22.031
- Fred...
- No.

17:23.731 --> 17:25.733
70 grand and it's yours.

17:27.001 --> 17:29.871
I only got a contract for 50.

17:29.904 --> 17:30.805
- Well, I...
- You got

17:30.838 --> 17:33.508
a contract on you for $50,000?

17:36.978 --> 17:39.414
Fred, this is a scam.

17:39.448 --> 17:40.149
Now hold on here.

17:40.181 --> 17:42.483
Are you callin' me a liar?

17:42.517 --> 17:45.853
Listen, quit that country
bumpkin bullshit, Alec.

17:45.886 --> 17:47.623
It's Alex.

17:47.655 --> 17:50.825
Well, Alec, why
did you come to us?

17:50.859 --> 17:53.962
Fred, you want
$70,000 you better tell

17:53.995 --> 17:56.431
your boy here to take a walk.

17:56.465 --> 17:58.132
- Santi, Santi...
- Who you callin'

17:58.165 --> 17:59.801
boy?

17:59.834 --> 18:00.701
Santi, just go wait

18:00.735 --> 18:01.969
- in the car.
- No.

18:03.939 --> 18:05.606
- Santi wait in the car.
- No.

18:07.575 --> 18:08.810
Wait in the car.

18:13.748 --> 18:14.882
Do you need a refill

18:14.915 --> 18:15.550
- on your syrup?
- Santi do not do...

18:16.551 --> 18:19.455
- Hey.
- Oh, that's just great.

18:19.488 --> 18:20.956
Maggie, I'm sorry.

18:20.988 --> 18:22.658
I got it Maggie, I got it.

18:25.026 --> 18:27.662
- Yeah.
- Santi, Santi, Santi.

18:28.596 --> 18:30.498
I should probably go, too.

18:30.532 --> 18:31.667
Alex?

18:38.172 --> 18:39.974
Are you playin' me?

18:40.976 --> 18:42.978
How long have we
known each other?

18:43.010 --> 18:44.512
Are you?

18:44.546 --> 18:46.648
Fred, it's me, man.

18:46.680 --> 18:47.815
It's Al.

18:52.988 --> 18:53.788
Okay.

18:53.822 --> 18:56.691
To hell with the
whole damn valley.

18:56.725 --> 18:58.227
If Shore wants what I got,

18:58.259 --> 19:01.497
$70,000's my minimum,
you understand?

19:01.529 --> 19:02.830
Yeah.

19:02.863 --> 19:04.165
Now, I'd like more.

19:04.199 --> 19:06.067
Can I get more?

19:06.101 --> 19:07.169
Huh?

19:07.201 --> 19:08.903
I'll do my best.

19:11.206 --> 19:12.040
You got another rag?

19:12.073 --> 19:14.109
Sure, Fred.

19:15.009 --> 19:17.011
We'll be talkin'.

19:17.045 --> 19:18.046
Yeah.

19:26.254 --> 19:29.024
I own the space,

19:29.056 --> 19:32.227
and the water that
travels through it,

19:32.259 --> 19:35.063
and the poison that lies within.

19:49.110 --> 19:49.911
Fred.

20:13.367 --> 20:15.036
It's not just here.

20:15.069 --> 20:17.906
Tell me you didn't
sign that deal.

20:42.363 --> 20:43.198
Water.

20:44.399 --> 20:45.767
It's the water.

20:53.908 --> 20:55.244
You son of a bitch.

20:57.178 --> 20:58.680
Fred...

20:58.712 --> 21:01.148
Hey, come on, come on, Fred.

21:01.181 --> 21:02.116
Hold on, Fred.

21:04.885 --> 21:06.154
Fred, oh, come on!

21:25.973 --> 21:27.108
- Alex!
- There's someone after me!

21:27.142 --> 21:28.776
- Who?
- Did you hear what I said?

21:28.809 --> 21:30.044
He's comin' after me!

21:30.077 --> 21:31.979
- Who's comin' after you?
- Oh, God!

21:32.013 --> 21:32.981
- Fred!
- Hey!

21:33.014 --> 21:34.082
Stern, did he sign?

21:34.114 --> 21:36.084
- Come on, Fred.
- Stern, did he sign?

21:36.116 --> 21:37.219
Alex?

21:37.251 --> 21:37.952
- Come on Fred!
- Hey!

21:37.986 --> 21:39.720
- Fred, it was all her!
- Alex!

21:39.754 --> 21:40.889
- I didn't know!
- Hey, bozo!

21:42.090 --> 21:43.158
God damn it.

21:44.025 --> 21:45.661
Fred.

21:45.693 --> 21:48.296
Oh, you yella son of a bitch.

21:48.328 --> 21:50.132
Fred,
please, I didn't know.

21:50.164 --> 21:51.065
God!

21:51.098 --> 21:52.299
Gigi, I can't go to prison.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.702
- Sure you can.
- Well, Gigi Cutler.

21:54.736 --> 21:55.771
Fred, please.

21:56.837 --> 21:58.239
I can't, I'm sorry, Fred.

22:02.110 --> 22:05.180
Lady, you better tell me
what's goin' on right now.

22:05.212 --> 22:06.882
I bit my tongue.

22:06.914 --> 22:08.149
Well, that's too bad.

22:08.182 --> 22:09.950
You're gonna need that
where you're goin'.

22:09.984 --> 22:11.186
America's farmers

22:11.219 --> 22:13.154
are killin' themselves
in record numbers.

22:13.188 --> 22:14.256
You like where you're goin'?

22:14.288 --> 22:15.123
You know what?

22:15.157 --> 22:16.324
I'm gonna find out
what's been goin'

22:16.356 --> 22:18.693
on with my water
and when I do...

22:19.393 --> 22:20.395
Hey Stern?

22:23.163 --> 22:25.033
How much, right now?

22:27.401 --> 22:29.304
Everyone's got a price.

22:32.006 --> 22:33.208
Ha!

22:33.240 --> 22:34.075
Well, somethin' tells me we're

22:34.109 --> 22:38.046
gonna be figurin'
that out together.

22:38.078 --> 22:40.114
I'll be seein' ya.

22:40.148 --> 22:43.285
I got all the money
in the world, boy!

22:53.894 --> 22:55.930
Had the poison not
risen to the surface,

22:55.963 --> 22:58.299
Mr. Stern woulda
signed that deal.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.969
This particular conversation,

23:01.001 --> 23:03.337
is in thanks to my predecessor.

23:04.773 --> 23:06.274
You tryin' to pin this on me?

23:06.306 --> 23:09.243
Those pits were dug
under your tenure.

23:09.276 --> 23:10.511
Miss Cutler, the board's issue

23:10.545 --> 23:12.480
is not with the
pollution itself,

23:12.514 --> 23:15.984
but with your failure
to cover it up.

23:16.017 --> 23:18.320
Then I shoulda been made
aware of it when I took over.

23:18.353 --> 23:19.988
Oh, come on, what?

23:20.020 --> 23:21.355
If you buy a house
you gonna blame

23:21.389 --> 23:24.192
the last owner because
it catches fire?

23:24.225 --> 23:26.728
Only if the house was yours.

23:28.296 --> 23:31.333
Gentlemen, let's get
back to the issue.

23:32.467 --> 23:34.503
Stern smelled blood
and so he found

23:34.536 --> 23:39.173
a lawyer with an appetite
for fortune equal to his own.

23:39.207 --> 23:42.377
The man who killed the Pinto.

23:42.410 --> 23:45.279
This bastard killed the Pinto?

23:47.347 --> 23:48.783
Dead.

23:48.816 --> 23:49.884
Thank you, John.

23:49.918 --> 23:50.986
Safe journey.

23:53.353 --> 23:55.157
Come in, come in.

23:55.190 --> 23:57.459
Hey, are you Ralph Egis?

23:57.491 --> 24:00.027
Aegis, A-E-G-I-S.

24:00.061 --> 24:01.263
You been waiting long?

24:01.296 --> 24:03.265
- Well...
- Sorry about that.

24:03.297 --> 24:05.032
You can sit but before we begin,

24:05.065 --> 24:07.134
lemme just say,
I'm not interested

24:07.168 --> 24:09.571
in petty squabbles or
seeking settlements.

24:09.603 --> 24:11.139
If you're here for
such I'd be happy

24:11.171 --> 24:14.476
to refer you to any of
my esteemed colleagues.

24:14.508 --> 24:16.178
Is that a Ford Pinto?

24:16.210 --> 24:17.378
No, Sir.

24:17.411 --> 24:20.448
That is the head of the
fiery dragon, Pinto,

24:20.480 --> 24:23.517
which I engaged in mortal
combat in the late '70s.

24:23.551 --> 24:24.920
Huh.

24:24.952 --> 24:27.955
Shitty God damn
car, not a great pony.

24:28.623 --> 24:29.990
Ask him.

24:30.024 --> 24:32.026
He was Ford at the time.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.897
We was slingin' Pinto's
like cocaine cupcakes.

24:35.930 --> 24:37.298
I was pretty hot back then.

24:37.332 --> 24:39.133
So was the Pinto, of course.

24:39.167 --> 24:41.436
So hot in fact
that its fuel tank

24:41.469 --> 24:43.238
would ignite and
burst into flames

24:43.270 --> 24:45.239
if it got hit in a
rear end collision.

24:45.273 --> 24:47.242
Nothin's perfect.

24:47.275 --> 24:48.410
Nothin's for free.

24:48.442 --> 24:51.046
Which amounted
to 180 burn deaths

24:51.078 --> 24:52.246
a year in the U.S. alone.

24:52.279 --> 24:53.447
- Now...
- Accidents happen,

24:53.480 --> 24:54.882
people die.

24:54.915 --> 24:56.317
According to an
internal Ford memo,

24:56.351 --> 24:59.187
it would cost the
company $11 per Pinto

24:59.219 --> 25:00.555
to fix the problem
with a recall.

25:00.587 --> 25:02.556
But with 12,000,000
of 'em on the road,

25:02.590 --> 25:05.327
that would cost $137,000,000,

25:05.360 --> 25:09.296
compared with $50,000,000
to maintain the status quo.

25:09.330 --> 25:11.299
Nobody wants to
blame their baby boy,

25:11.332 --> 25:14.969
oh, little Miss Suck A Dick
for their own emulation.

25:15.003 --> 25:16.638
They want deniability.

25:16.671 --> 25:18.105
Ford did the math.

25:18.139 --> 25:21.276
$137,000,000 to solve
a $50,000,000 problem?

25:21.308 --> 25:22.209
"No, problem.

25:22.242 --> 25:24.111
"Let 'em burn," and they did.

25:24.144 --> 25:27.882
And our Pinto's unique,
cheap and patented design

25:27.915 --> 25:29.483
provided the perfect patsy.

25:29.517 --> 25:32.453
Eventually, thank God, a
disgruntled Ford employee blew

25:32.487 --> 25:34.355
the whistle and got
us the internal memo.

25:34.389 --> 25:36.992
And then some low life
leaks our book keepers doodles

25:37.025 --> 25:38.994
and before you know
it, just like that,

25:39.026 --> 25:41.462
the Pinto falls from grace.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.297
Took Ford to court
in a class action

25:43.331 --> 25:44.666
and I took the Pinto's head.

25:44.699 --> 25:46.534
Bad year for business, '78.

25:46.566 --> 25:49.036
Good year for barbecue.

25:52.472 --> 25:53.507
What's your name again?

25:53.540 --> 25:54.909
Fred Stern.

25:54.942 --> 25:57.244
I think I might have
what you're looking for.

25:57.277 --> 25:59.213
You found me a dragon?

25:59.247 --> 26:01.083
The dragon found me.

26:04.384 --> 26:06.153
There are these, too.

26:09.056 --> 26:10.190
Why are you doing this?

26:10.223 --> 26:11.392
They're poisoning my farm.

26:11.426 --> 26:12.394
Obviously.

26:12.427 --> 26:13.561
And they're trying to buy

26:13.594 --> 26:15.330
me off with a
measly five figures.

26:15.363 --> 26:18.299
Could they do it for six?

26:18.333 --> 26:19.601
Seven?

26:19.633 --> 26:22.237
How much would it
take, Mr. Stern?

26:22.269 --> 26:24.506
See, that's the key question.

26:24.538 --> 26:26.407
And I am left to
wonder if you're here

26:26.440 --> 26:28.476
to slay a dragon or
get paid off by one.

26:29.610 --> 26:32.147
Let me know when you decide.

26:34.481 --> 26:35.282
Hello.

26:35.315 --> 26:36.116
Damn it!

26:41.122 --> 26:42.556
Who the hell does
he think he is?

26:50.297 --> 26:52.534
Who the hell is this?

26:59.507 --> 27:01.476
Are you Fred Stern?

27:02.543 --> 27:03.578
Yeah.

27:05.479 --> 27:06.748
What are you doin' here?

27:06.780 --> 27:08.450
Oh, I wanted to...

27:10.218 --> 27:11.252
I need to...

27:11.285 --> 27:12.521
Need to do what?

27:14.654 --> 27:16.690
I'm sorry, I should go.

27:16.723 --> 27:18.726
No, no, wait a second.

27:20.661 --> 27:22.965
Did Gigi Cutler send you?

27:25.533 --> 27:26.568
No.

27:27.735 --> 27:32.474
No, but I heard what she did
and I just wanted to help.

27:34.642 --> 27:36.544
You wanna help me?

27:36.576 --> 27:37.478
Yes, Sir.

27:38.478 --> 27:39.581
Why?

27:39.613 --> 27:42.483
Why would you wanna do that?

27:42.517 --> 27:43.719
Gigi's a bitch.

27:50.490 --> 27:52.594
You want a cup of coffee?

27:52.626 --> 27:55.329
These are really good, Fred.

27:56.497 --> 27:58.632
Yeah, yeah, my
wife painted 'em.

27:58.665 --> 27:59.566
Oh.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.404
Is she a professional artist?

28:02.437 --> 28:04.606
No, no, she passed away.

28:06.239 --> 28:08.575
I'm sorry, I didn't...

28:08.609 --> 28:10.412
That's all right.

28:11.645 --> 28:13.614
So, you wanna help me?

28:13.648 --> 28:16.251
Well, why are they all boats?

28:18.585 --> 28:20.622
No need to be
nervous, all right?

28:20.654 --> 28:23.290
Just, why don't you sit down?

28:24.325 --> 28:25.160
Yeah.

28:28.129 --> 28:31.533
So, you got something
on Gigi Cutler, huh?

28:31.565 --> 28:32.467
What is it?

28:34.434 --> 28:35.769
This about a memo or somethin'?

28:35.803 --> 28:38.238
I shouldn't be here.

28:38.271 --> 28:39.206
Fred, I should go.

28:39.239 --> 28:41.209
Yeah, yeah, boats, boats.

28:41.241 --> 28:44.078
Yeah, there is a lot
of 'em.

28:44.112 --> 28:47.114
You see, they're,
well, when my wife

28:48.315 --> 28:49.651
and I were kids she had a dream

28:49.683 --> 28:53.421
that we would sail around
the world together one day.

28:53.453 --> 28:54.588
Well, did you?

28:56.423 --> 28:58.793
No, no, we had a farm to run.

28:59.794 --> 29:01.429
Work and life.

29:01.461 --> 29:04.598
Life gets in the way
of life.

29:04.632 --> 29:08.603
So we didn't but she
painted it, our journey.

29:09.536 --> 29:12.739
That one's us leaving
Long Beach Harbor.

29:12.773 --> 29:13.741
The one above the mantelpiece

29:13.774 --> 29:15.577
is us sailing into Cape Town,

29:15.610 --> 29:18.213
and the one above your head,

29:18.246 --> 29:20.114
that's us gettin'
caught in a storm

29:20.148 --> 29:23.852
around in the horn.

29:25.152 --> 29:28.489
She didn't
finish that one.

29:28.523 --> 29:29.424
No, no.

29:29.457 --> 29:31.526
She died before she could.

29:33.393 --> 29:36.297
That's you and
Nancy comin' home?

29:38.533 --> 29:40.568
Yeah, that's exactly
what is.

29:40.601 --> 29:41.436
It's...

29:43.703 --> 29:46.640
Yeah, I never told
anyone that before.

29:46.673 --> 29:48.809
And everyday I regret the...

29:52.246 --> 29:53.648
I never told you her name.

29:56.918 --> 29:57.752
Wow.

29:58.885 --> 30:01.555
How filthy you must
feel right now.

30:01.588 --> 30:03.257
Hawkin' your dead wife's memory

30:03.290 --> 30:05.626
for a slim shot at a leg up.

30:06.760 --> 30:07.795
Oh, Freddy.

30:07.827 --> 30:09.163
How the hell did you know...

30:09.197 --> 30:10.231
Shh, shh.

30:10.264 --> 30:10.899
Excuse me.

30:12.333 --> 30:13.634
I gotta take this.

30:17.438 --> 30:18.473
- I'm here.
- Farmer turn you out?

30:18.506 --> 30:21.642
No, I'm
drinkin' his piss poor coffee

30:21.676 --> 30:25.713
- in his shit hole of a house.
- All right, make him see.

30:25.746 --> 30:29.184
Yeah,
I'll bring him around.

30:29.217 --> 30:31.319
Who the hell are you?

30:31.352 --> 30:32.754
Why don't you just
sit down there, hoss?

30:32.786 --> 30:35.289
No, you're leavin'.

30:35.323 --> 30:36.623
I have a message to deliver.

30:36.657 --> 30:39.694
You know, you are trespassing.

30:39.727 --> 30:41.930
I could kick your
butt and the cops

30:41.962 --> 30:43.864
wouldn't even blink an eye.

30:45.432 --> 30:47.734
Could you, though?

30:47.767 --> 30:52.274
And even if you do I'm still
gonna keep comin' back.

30:53.641 --> 30:57.278
You get the hell outta
my house right now.

30:58.478 --> 30:59.280
Okay.

31:00.514 --> 31:03.251
I'll get the hell
outta your house.

31:04.352 --> 31:05.719
The message is this.

31:05.753 --> 31:06.688
You're never gonna
get even close

31:06.720 --> 31:09.390
to what's owed you, so drop it.

31:09.422 --> 31:11.226
There's a million
reasons why you should

31:11.258 --> 31:12.693
and you're gonna wake
up to every single

31:12.727 --> 31:15.662
one of 'em in your
bank account if you do.

31:15.696 --> 31:17.799
A million isn't even close?

31:19.499 --> 31:20.767
Oh my.

31:20.801 --> 31:21.936
Dumb and put upon.

31:21.969 --> 31:23.671
You are a peach, Freddy.

31:23.703 --> 31:25.572
Oh, God damn it!

31:25.605 --> 31:27.275
I forgot the if not.

31:28.676 --> 31:32.814
If you don't drop it, Mr.
Stern, I'm gonna start takin'.

31:33.780 --> 31:34.681
I ain't gonna stop.

31:34.715 --> 31:36.785
They don't pay me to stop.

31:37.951 --> 31:40.555
I'ma take everything.

31:40.587 --> 31:44.858
I'll take everything you
love, everything you made.

31:45.759 --> 31:47.362
I'ma take it all,

31:49.330 --> 31:49.964
if not.

31:53.801 --> 31:56.304
- Your chair's on fire.
- Huh?

32:00.040 --> 32:01.475
Damn it!

32:40.748 --> 32:41.949
Whoa!

32:43.417 --> 32:45.586
God.

32:50.357 --> 32:51.358
That's nice.

32:51.392 --> 32:52.626
This the Pinto, right?

32:53.460 --> 32:54.628
I like it, good car.

32:54.661 --> 32:57.899
No, no.

32:57.931 --> 33:00.334
Ralph, thanks for comin' in.

33:00.367 --> 33:01.535
- I...
- Is he with you?

33:01.568 --> 33:02.869
- Yeah, he...
- Oh, I was about

33:02.902 --> 33:03.837
to call the cops.

33:03.871 --> 33:04.906
I'm sorry, man.

33:10.443 --> 33:11.611
So what did you decide?

33:11.644 --> 33:13.013
A man offered me a
million dollars tonight.

33:13.046 --> 33:14.414
Hm.

33:14.448 --> 33:15.049
And?

33:15.082 --> 33:15.983
I said no.

33:16.016 --> 33:17.651
Why?

33:17.684 --> 33:19.419
Because they owe me more.

33:19.452 --> 33:21.756
They're poisoning
my home and it may

33:21.788 --> 33:24.558
not be much but it was ours
and it was a good home.

33:24.592 --> 33:25.860
You can ask Santi.

33:25.892 --> 33:27.894
Ralph, they may have
poisoned my wife.

33:27.928 --> 33:29.397
We might not be able to prove it

33:29.430 --> 33:32.734
but they're gonna rob
me of that, of our life,

33:32.767 --> 33:34.768
I'm gonna rob them of theirs.

33:34.802 --> 33:36.003
- Hm.
- You know how much money

33:36.036 --> 33:39.039
they've made poisoning my land?

33:39.073 --> 33:42.910
2.1 billion dollars and
that's just one year.

33:42.942 --> 33:44.010
Over 10 years?

33:44.044 --> 33:45.580
- At least.
- Hm.

33:47.748 --> 33:48.583
Hm.

33:49.950 --> 33:51.119
Well?

33:52.920 --> 33:56.690
Well, I'd say they
owe you at least a year.

33:57.557 --> 34:00.427
Well, are we gonna do this or?

34:00.460 --> 34:04.132
I'd say there's enough room
over there for an oil rig.

34:04.164 --> 34:07.634
This okay with your
anarchist principles?

34:09.636 --> 34:12.172
For 2.1 billion,
are you kidding me?

34:20.980 --> 34:22.482
Let's do it then.

34:36.897 --> 34:37.998
Two!

34:39.065 --> 34:41.034
$2,000,000,000 Olive!

34:42.002 --> 34:44.438
That's two too many
and way too much.

34:44.471 --> 34:45.871
Slow your roll.

34:45.906 --> 34:48.743
Let me take a look
at the summons.

34:48.775 --> 34:51.779
All right, negligent trespass.

34:51.812 --> 34:53.681
Ralph Aegis representing.

34:53.714 --> 34:56.817
I mean, it's gonna be tough.

34:56.850 --> 34:57.919
If you can't beat 'em then

34:57.951 --> 34:59.853
I should just call 777.

34:59.886 --> 35:01.689
Well, he was big in
the '80s but you know

35:01.721 --> 35:04.624
what Sun Tzu said about
underestimating your opponents.

35:04.658 --> 35:05.460
What's that?

35:05.493 --> 35:06.160
Don't.

35:06.192 --> 35:06.826
Drink?

35:24.011 --> 35:25.179
Howdy!

35:26.046 --> 35:27.781
Oh, God!

35:27.814 --> 35:30.017
Fuck, what is that?

35:30.049 --> 35:31.218
What was it?

35:32.919 --> 35:34.721
Clumsy.

35:34.754 --> 35:35.922
Who are you?

35:35.955 --> 35:37.924
I'm from Houston.

35:37.957 --> 35:39.960
That's in Texas, Ma'am.

35:39.993 --> 35:41.796
Like all my exes.

35:43.029 --> 35:45.600
Did corporate send you?

35:45.632 --> 35:46.600
Yep.

35:46.634 --> 35:49.003
- I didn't ask for any...
- Help?

35:49.035 --> 35:50.971
Who the hell do
you think you are?

35:51.004 --> 35:54.075
I think I'm from
fuckin' Houston.

35:56.176 --> 35:57.178
Oh boy.

35:57.210 --> 35:58.046
Come here.

35:59.747 --> 36:02.517
- Sorry G.
- Come on, come sit down.

36:02.549 --> 36:03.850
- Oh, Christ.
- Here you go.

36:03.884 --> 36:05.019
- Oh, thank you.
- There's a switch

36:05.051 --> 36:07.020
on the front.

36:07.053 --> 36:07.854
Whew.

36:07.888 --> 36:11.526
Hey Texas, my net
worth isn't puke.

36:11.558 --> 36:12.160
I know.

36:13.593 --> 36:15.996
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have cursed at a lady.

36:16.029 --> 36:19.866
I just, I don't like
to repeat myself.

36:19.899 --> 36:21.968
You have to understand, Gigi,
I'm just here here to help.

36:22.002 --> 36:26.741
See, if this farmer is
successful with this lawsuit,

36:26.774 --> 36:28.942
then he has established
a precedent.

36:28.975 --> 36:31.211
No shit, it's gonna be open
season for all the big boys.

36:31.245 --> 36:33.047
Anyone, anyone
who's ever taken

36:33.080 --> 36:34.748
a piss in a peasants pond.

36:34.781 --> 36:36.082
Oh, I'm not gonna
let it happen.

36:36.116 --> 36:37.218
No, me neither.

36:37.250 --> 36:40.020
What are you
gonna do about it?

36:42.022 --> 36:44.091
You hear that?

36:44.123 --> 36:45.026
Just listen for a second.

36:45.058 --> 36:46.093
Just close your eyes.

36:48.027 --> 36:49.564
I'm listenin'.

36:51.165 --> 36:54.936
That is the sound of
progress uninterrupted.

36:54.968 --> 36:59.139
That is the sound of money
found and fortunes won.

37:00.808 --> 37:03.076
That's not just a lawsuit, Gigi.

37:03.109 --> 37:04.312
It's a revolution.

37:04.344 --> 37:05.879
We lose, we die.

37:07.013 --> 37:08.782
So they send you.

37:09.950 --> 37:10.718
Guys, I'm gonna
,

37:10.750 --> 37:11.953
I'm gonna take a walk.

37:11.986 --> 37:14.288
I'll be over here
if you need me.

37:17.357 --> 37:21.127
I'm here to bring
Stern to the table, Gig.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.697
He's not gonna come on his own,

37:23.730 --> 37:25.065
and I'm gonna bring
him to his knees.

37:28.301 --> 37:30.671
In the event that
my learned colleague

37:30.703 --> 37:32.839
for the defense
tries to convince you

37:32.872 --> 37:35.175
that this is a
very complex case,

37:35.209 --> 37:39.379
kindly permit me to offer a
very, very simple analogy, okay?

37:39.413 --> 37:42.950
Let's say for example your
next door neighbor runs

37:42.982 --> 37:47.187
a dog kennel and one day
one of their dogs escapes,

37:47.221 --> 37:49.056
and he wanders over
onto your property

37:49.089 --> 37:51.625
and he beats right on your lawn.

37:51.658 --> 37:53.660
Well, and no offense
to the court,

37:53.694 --> 37:55.228
but shit happens but what would

37:55.261 --> 37:57.765
you expect from that neighbor?

37:57.797 --> 37:58.899
Well, bottom line that
they would come over

37:58.933 --> 38:01.701
and apologize and clean up
their mess and assure you

38:01.734 --> 38:04.337
that this would never
happen again, am I right?

38:04.370 --> 38:06.039
End of story.

38:06.073 --> 38:09.377
But now, what if you found out
that for the last 10 years,

38:09.410 --> 38:12.046
that dog and 20
other dogs like it,

38:12.078 --> 38:13.781
were in fact
trained to come over

38:13.814 --> 38:17.785
onto your property and dump
tons of canine excrement

38:17.817 --> 38:19.120
right on your front porch.

38:19.152 --> 38:21.087
What would you expect
from that neighbor now?

38:21.120 --> 38:23.089
Well, you can't
even say can you?

38:23.122 --> 38:23.923
No, of course not.

38:23.957 --> 38:26.160
Because you cannot
possibly imagine

38:26.192 --> 38:28.895
such a scenario being true.

38:28.928 --> 38:31.364
Well, I'm here to assure
you that it is true,

38:31.397 --> 38:34.134
that it has been happening
for the past 10 years

38:34.167 --> 38:36.671
to my client, Mr. Fred Stern,

38:36.703 --> 38:38.872
that it continues to
happen as we speak

38:38.906 --> 38:41.142
and the perpetrator, Shore Oil,

38:41.174 --> 38:42.743
knew from the start all about it

38:42.776 --> 38:45.245
and they did absolutely
nothing but profit

38:45.279 --> 38:49.884
to the tune of $20,000,000,000
over the last 10 years.

38:49.917 --> 38:51.252
Well, friends, we're
gonna prove our case,

38:51.285 --> 38:54.821
and we are gonna extract
$2,000,000,000 from Shore Oil

38:54.855 --> 38:56.190
in compensation and
we're gonna use it

38:56.223 --> 38:57.825
to clean up their mess and we're

38:57.857 --> 39:00.960
gonna make damn sure that
their irresponsible destruction

39:00.993 --> 39:04.265
of the environment for profit
ends with your verdict.

39:04.297 --> 39:05.098
Thank you.

39:05.131 --> 39:06.166
Your honor, may I
approach the bench?

39:06.200 --> 39:07.468
Yes.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.736
I have to go to the
toilet very badly.

39:09.770 --> 39:10.771
Go.

39:10.803 --> 39:11.838
Thank you, thank you.

39:11.872 --> 39:13.007
God.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.109
Fred, listen, I'm
gonna go to the toilet.

39:15.142 --> 39:16.176
Take notes on
everything she says.

39:16.210 --> 39:17.878
- I'll be right back.
- What?

39:17.910 --> 39:18.712
Miss Gore.

39:27.453 --> 39:30.091
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

39:30.123 --> 39:32.225
that dog just don't hunt.

39:33.460 --> 39:38.299
Now, Shore Oil has always been
environmentally responsible.

39:39.232 --> 39:41.035
That's not what this
is about though, is it?

39:41.067 --> 39:44.471
This, this is Fred
Stern's personal crusade

39:47.306 --> 39:51.145
to gain wealth and to
push his leftist agenda.

39:52.011 --> 39:53.913
We've all seen the news.

39:53.946 --> 39:56.783
We've all seen the deterioration

39:56.817 --> 39:59.920
of the great industries
of this country.

39:59.953 --> 40:02.022
Jobs fleeing to China,

40:02.055 --> 40:06.227
while more and more
jobless immigrants pour in,

40:06.259 --> 40:09.229
taking what little we've got.

40:09.263 --> 40:10.464
Fred Stern doesn't
see it this way.

40:10.497 --> 40:15.802
No, he sees this as a move in
the right, the left direction.

40:22.209 --> 40:24.310
What was your strategy
as the case moved forward?

40:24.343 --> 40:27.013
It was nut cuttin' time.

40:27.047 --> 40:28.482
Starve Stern out in court,

40:28.515 --> 40:30.183
smother him in
political diatribe

40:30.216 --> 40:34.287
while your man forced the
issue from the outside.

40:34.321 --> 40:37.056
A little help from Alex Gardner.

40:43.497 --> 40:45.399
Gigi, confession.

40:45.431 --> 40:47.234
Take one.

40:47.267 --> 40:48.301
Gigi confession, take...

41:27.073 --> 41:28.508
- Alexander.
- I didn't mean to,

41:28.542 --> 41:30.411
- I didn't mean to...
- Alexander James...

41:30.444 --> 41:31.579
- It just went off!
- Shut your fuckin'

41:31.611 --> 41:33.113
whimperin' boy!

41:35.348 --> 41:38.484
Failed actor, disgraced ad man,

41:38.518 --> 41:41.388
turned into a cold
blooded killer.

41:41.421 --> 41:43.022
Who knew you had such balls.

41:46.426 --> 41:48.895
I didn't mean to hurt
anybody, I just want...

41:49.562 --> 41:51.331
Oo.

41:51.364 --> 41:53.399
I just wanted my job back.

41:53.433 --> 41:56.070
I was just.

41:56.102 --> 41:56.903
No, no.

41:58.305 --> 42:01.875
I just wanted...

42:03.410 --> 42:04.578
You wanted redemption.

42:07.180 --> 42:07.982
Hm.

42:10.049 --> 42:10.852
Oh wow.

42:11.919 --> 42:13.353
Oh, you poor boy.

42:15.321 --> 42:16.356
Broken.

42:18.959 --> 42:20.460
It's gonna be all right.

42:20.493 --> 42:22.428
- Yeah.
- You gonna tell her?

42:22.462 --> 42:23.430
Mm mm.

42:23.462 --> 42:24.564
Not me.

42:24.598 --> 42:25.433
Not her.

42:26.500 --> 42:27.935
You're not?

42:27.968 --> 42:29.069
What the fuck did I
just say to you, boy?

42:29.102 --> 42:31.906
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Shh, shh, shh.

42:56.462 --> 42:58.031
What are you doin'?

42:58.064 --> 43:00.300
Same thing as you.

43:00.334 --> 43:01.435
Killing Gigi.

43:03.437 --> 43:04.238
But why?

43:06.138 --> 43:06.940
Why?

43:11.344 --> 43:12.513
Big Boss sent me.

43:13.547 --> 43:14.382
Ruination.

43:18.384 --> 43:20.353
What do you think this
whole case is for, huh?

43:20.386 --> 43:22.221
Why do you think that
farmer's askin' for billions?

43:22.254 --> 43:24.257
'Cause I made it so.

43:24.290 --> 43:25.125
Me.

43:41.140 --> 43:44.110
No.

43:49.515 --> 43:51.084
Say you came to kill her.

43:52.185 --> 43:53.520
Say it.

43:53.553 --> 43:56.422
I came here to kill Gigi.

43:56.455 --> 43:57.658
That's right.

44:00.593 --> 44:01.962
That is right.

44:03.730 --> 44:07.634
You are way more than
they think you are, Alex.

44:07.667 --> 44:08.469
You are.

44:13.205 --> 44:14.040
We are.

44:29.388 --> 44:31.424
I'm gonna build somethin' here.

44:31.457 --> 44:32.692
Me.

44:32.725 --> 44:35.528
I want you buy my side,
but I need to know

44:35.562 --> 44:37.598
that I can trust you, Alex,

44:38.732 --> 44:41.569
with even my deepest
darkest secrets.

44:42.636 --> 44:43.804
Darkest secrets.

44:43.837 --> 44:44.672
So...

44:49.743 --> 44:51.511
What do you say, boy?

45:18.772 --> 45:19.607
What?

45:22.375 --> 45:24.578
Okay, we'll give most
of it away to charity.

45:24.611 --> 45:25.446
You happy?

45:27.580 --> 45:29.849
It's a noble plan, comrade.

45:29.882 --> 45:31.218
Don't call me that.

45:31.250 --> 45:32.386
Why not?

45:32.419 --> 45:35.589
You rob from the rich, you
give to the poor.

45:35.622 --> 45:37.457
Tell me comrade,
you gonna donate

45:37.491 --> 45:40.259
your billions after
you get your boat,

45:40.292 --> 45:41.661
or after you buy
your skyscraper?

45:41.694 --> 45:42.629
Santiago.

45:43.596 --> 45:45.732
You gonna put your name on it?

45:45.765 --> 45:48.835
You think I'm
doing this for money?

45:50.703 --> 45:52.105
You think you'll
have a problem

45:52.138 --> 45:54.607
if I say something
about, you know?

45:57.410 --> 45:58.678
No, go ahead.

45:59.846 --> 46:04.351
At the end, you were so
obsessed with beating it that,

46:05.685 --> 46:07.855
you couldn't accept
it when she lost.

46:07.888 --> 46:09.556
It wasn't beautiful.

46:10.656 --> 46:14.594
Losing her was
never gonna be pretty.

46:14.627 --> 46:17.631
Losing yourself,
that was the ugly part.

46:17.663 --> 46:20.633
Fighting these
pigs, that's good.

46:21.734 --> 46:23.503
Don't confuse
fighting with living

46:23.536 --> 46:25.772
and distraction with healing.

46:35.381 --> 46:38.217
You think they might kill you?

46:38.250 --> 46:40.286
Yeah, they probably will.

46:40.319 --> 46:41.754
$2,000,000,000.

46:43.689 --> 46:45.492
I'd do it for half.

46:46.859 --> 46:48.161
You?

46:48.194 --> 46:49.462
You'd do it for free.

46:49.495 --> 46:51.198
Yeah, I would do it for free.

46:54.667 --> 46:55.736
You smell that?

46:56.602 --> 46:58.171
Smell what?

46:58.205 --> 46:58.805
Smoke.

47:03.810 --> 47:04.645
The trees.

47:06.446 --> 47:09.183
Santi, there
are a lotta men in there.

47:09.216 --> 47:11.951
You take the north,
I'll take the south side.

47:27.901 --> 47:29.835
Stop, the wind's changing!

47:29.868 --> 47:30.970
We gotta get outta here.

47:31.004 --> 47:31.672
- Santi...
- There's nothing

47:31.705 --> 47:32.706
more we can do!

47:32.739 --> 47:33.674
Go, come on!

47:48.721 --> 47:49.989
They burned
my trees, Ralph.

47:50.022 --> 47:51.857
20 acres gone up in smoke.

47:51.890 --> 47:53.626
We can't prove
it was them, Fred.

47:53.660 --> 47:54.761
We need facts.

47:54.794 --> 47:56.230
They don't care about facts.

47:56.263 --> 47:58.265
They just, they, oh God.

47:59.832 --> 48:03.970
They just want, they
just, they want drama.

48:04.004 --> 48:05.572
No, they want blood.

48:05.605 --> 48:08.275
They wanna see my writing
Gigi Cutler's name

48:08.308 --> 48:09.876
- in my own viscera.
- Prove it was them, Fred.

48:09.908 --> 48:10.810
We need proof.

48:10.843 --> 48:12.712
South ranch needs spraying.

48:12.745 --> 48:14.013
Scientific evidence, Fred.

48:14.047 --> 48:15.682
We don't need to pull
any heartstrings.

48:15.714 --> 48:18.451
We're gonna need more
hands for the harvest, too.

48:18.484 --> 48:21.721
So what do
you suggest, Fred?

48:21.754 --> 48:22.756
Alex Gardner.

48:22.788 --> 48:24.424
We flip that sleazy bastard.

48:24.457 --> 48:25.592
We get him to testify for us

48:25.625 --> 48:28.962
and then Shore Oil will be
dead in its own poison water.

48:28.995 --> 48:31.598
- If we could find him.
- Found him.

48:31.631 --> 48:32.799
Well, where
the hell is he?

48:32.832 --> 48:33.799
Where'd he go?

48:33.832 --> 48:35.868
My source says he blew
town when he got canned.

48:35.902 --> 48:37.437
That means he
could be anywhere.

48:37.469 --> 48:39.339
Nope, he's right here.

48:39.372 --> 48:40.806
Will you please shut up?

48:40.839 --> 48:42.675
I'm trying to do some work here.

48:42.709 --> 48:43.910
What?

48:49.549 --> 48:53.553
Santiago, why do I even
let you in the house?

48:56.489 --> 48:57.291
Fred?

48:57.323 --> 48:58.024
Yeah, hold on, Ralph.

48:58.058 --> 48:59.626
Just a second.

49:00.826 --> 49:01.727
- Well, Koko I'm not just here
- Ralph?

49:01.761 --> 49:03.062
To dance with
your lovely cohost.

49:03.096 --> 49:04.564
Ralph, turn on your TV.

49:04.596 --> 49:06.432
- Doug, take notes you slob.
- What for?

49:07.667 --> 49:08.869
I am here to make
an announcement

49:08.902 --> 49:10.804
on behalf of Shore
Energy about somethin'

49:10.837 --> 49:13.640
we're doin' to change the way
we do good in this county.

49:13.672 --> 49:16.910
We are starting the first
ever non-profit community

49:16.942 --> 49:18.844
wish fulfillment foundation.

49:20.580 --> 49:22.382
Wow, well it sounds sweet,
Alex, but let's be frank.

49:22.415 --> 49:25.018
What do I have to be riddled
with to get my wish fulfilled?

49:25.051 --> 49:26.652
All I care about.

49:26.685 --> 49:27.754
Nothin' at all, Koko.

49:27.786 --> 49:28.620
This is for everyone.

49:28.654 --> 49:31.390
Teachers, preachers,
doctors, coaches.

49:31.424 --> 49:33.493
You apply, we supply.

49:33.526 --> 49:34.861
Cash money money.

49:34.893 --> 49:35.828
Exactly.

49:35.861 --> 49:37.763
From this day forward,
Shore Energy is gonna

49:37.797 --> 49:40.801
be here to help bring
this community home.

49:52.946 --> 49:53.781
Energy?

49:55.415 --> 49:58.919
It's got a nice
environmentally responsible ring.

50:00.819 --> 50:02.488
That's not your call to make.

50:02.522 --> 50:03.924
No,
I was outta line.

50:10.696 --> 50:11.864
And Gardner.

50:12.899 --> 50:15.102
He will not represent this firm.

50:15.134 --> 50:18.671
G, keeping Alex
smiling keeps us safe.

50:19.672 --> 50:21.440
Kid's a star.

50:21.473 --> 50:24.443
He's an embarrassment,
a liability.

50:24.477 --> 50:26.980
But at the end of the
day, whose fault is that?

50:27.013 --> 50:28.415
Not you.

50:28.448 --> 50:30.116
You brought him
in, you cut him out.

50:30.149 --> 50:32.585
What'd you expect
was gonna happen?

50:32.618 --> 50:33.953
He was just gonna disappear.

50:33.986 --> 50:34.854
I would've...

50:34.888 --> 50:36.089
- What?
- I would've...

50:39.491 --> 50:41.728
What would you have done?

50:42.661 --> 50:43.497
Hm?

50:44.997 --> 50:48.834
Answer me, now!

50:48.868 --> 50:49.870
Go ahead.

50:51.571 --> 50:52.373
Moo.

50:55.542 --> 50:56.743
Miss Gore, from
this moment forward

50:56.777 --> 50:59.546
you will report directly to me
on all case related matters.

51:10.857 --> 51:13.893
You know, Gigi, I
watched you rise.

51:13.926 --> 51:16.762
Shatter that glass ceiling,

51:16.796 --> 51:19.466
and cut throats with the shards.

51:23.803 --> 51:25.939
Don't make me call Houston.

51:36.815 --> 51:40.486
You are in fact,
Professor John Orlan, PhD?

51:40.520 --> 51:41.755
Is that correct, Sir?

51:41.788 --> 51:44.024
This is cold, hard,
professional facts.

51:44.056 --> 51:46.892
This proves in fact,
a sample extracted

51:46.926 --> 51:50.964
from Fred Stern's ground
water on March 27th, 2017.

51:53.198 --> 51:54.500
Is that correct?

51:54.533 --> 51:55.468
Your Honor,
requesting permission

51:55.502 --> 51:56.636
to enter into evidence...

52:17.756 --> 52:19.058
The day has finally come.

52:19.091 --> 52:19.992
Here it is.

52:20.026 --> 52:21.094
Welcome home!

52:37.944 --> 52:39.246
On behalf of Shore Energy,

52:39.279 --> 52:42.748
we would like to
award you $4,500!

52:42.781 --> 52:43.682
Wow!

52:43.716 --> 52:44.918
$9,500!

52:44.951 --> 52:48.054
Now that's gonna be $10,000!

52:57.129 --> 52:58.097
That's nice!

52:59.098 --> 53:00.100
Get in there.

53:11.843 --> 53:12.745
Mr. Stenson what
you're telling me

53:12.779 --> 53:13.947
is that this is clean water?

53:13.980 --> 53:15.649
This is clean water
and this is clean water

53:15.681 --> 53:17.283
and that's Fred Stern's farm,

53:17.317 --> 53:18.952
and you're telling me that this

53:18.984 --> 53:23.622
is 100% usable water for
all irrigation purposes?

53:51.718 --> 53:52.953
Mr. Stern,
do you know what

53:52.986 --> 53:55.589
the net present value rule is?

53:55.622 --> 53:57.123
No, I don't.

53:57.156 --> 53:59.125
Have you ever heard
of the net present value rule?

53:59.158 --> 54:00.060
No.

54:00.093 --> 54:00.794
Has any member of the court?

54:00.826 --> 54:02.027
Miss Gore?

54:02.062 --> 54:05.031
Your Honor, do you know what
the net present value rule is?

54:05.064 --> 54:07.968
I'm quite certain you
are about to tell us all.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.169
Proceed, Mr. Aegis.

54:09.201 --> 54:10.002
Thank you, Your Honor.

54:10.035 --> 54:10.836
May it please the court.

54:10.870 --> 54:13.172
The net present
value rule states,

54:13.205 --> 54:15.140
if you make more money doing it

54:15.174 --> 54:17.844
than what it would cost if
you get caught doing it,

54:17.877 --> 54:19.112
continue doing it.

54:19.145 --> 54:19.946
Objection, Your Honor.

54:19.978 --> 54:20.747
Leading the witness.

54:20.779 --> 54:22.015
Sustained.

54:22.047 --> 54:23.116
- Get to the point, Aegis.
- Very well, Your Honor.

54:23.149 --> 54:26.620
Now then, Mr. Stern, there's
no doubt that your land

54:26.652 --> 54:29.989
has been polluted by
contaminated waste water.

54:30.022 --> 54:32.257
Help me to understand
something, please.

54:32.290 --> 54:36.028
Do you believe that a
multinational corporation

54:36.062 --> 54:39.665
like Shore Oil needed to do
what you say they'd done?

54:39.698 --> 54:41.166
No.

54:41.200 --> 54:43.703
No, I, I think they needed
to do just the opposite.

54:43.736 --> 54:45.105
But surely you can't expect us

54:45.138 --> 54:48.107
to believe there was any
intention to destroy your farm.

54:48.140 --> 54:49.075
I mean, what was

54:49.107 --> 54:50.009
- there to gain?
- The silver fox

54:50.042 --> 54:51.210
is asking all my questions.

54:51.243 --> 54:53.879
Well, I don't think
they intended it.

54:53.913 --> 54:56.216
Just like I don't
think BP intended

54:56.248 --> 54:59.652
the Deepwater Horizon
to blow sky high.

54:59.685 --> 55:01.187
But this isn't about intentions.

55:01.219 --> 55:05.325
If I'm not mistaken, this
is about responsibilities.

55:05.357 --> 55:07.126
Now, Shore Oil knew
what was happening

55:07.160 --> 55:08.761
but they didn't stop pumping

55:08.794 --> 55:11.664
their waste water
into those ponds.

55:12.330 --> 55:14.133
They didn't build any barriers,

55:14.167 --> 55:16.402
they certainly didn't
let me know what was up.

55:16.435 --> 55:21.642
They just sat on it, pumping
their poison into my earth.

55:22.774 --> 55:23.843
But aren't you
assuming they knew?

55:23.875 --> 55:25.944
Well, if they didn't why did

55:25.977 --> 55:28.847
they offer to buy
more pore space?

55:28.881 --> 55:30.183
Good question, Mr. Stern.

55:30.216 --> 55:32.218
Why don't you answer it?

55:32.250 --> 55:35.220
Well, they offered to buy
it because Gigi Cutler knew,

55:35.254 --> 55:36.956
and that's why she
sent Alex Gardner

55:36.989 --> 55:39.359
to make me an offer of $50,000,

55:40.460 --> 55:41.728
and then if I'd taken that

55:41.761 --> 55:44.096
I'd have lost
everything, everything.

55:44.129 --> 55:45.297
But I said no.

55:47.332 --> 55:50.936
Kinda makes me wonder
how many people say yes.

55:50.969 --> 55:52.439
How many hard working people

55:52.471 --> 55:55.374
get trumped on by
these companies

55:55.408 --> 55:58.877
and then they can
never tell the tale.

55:58.910 --> 56:00.079
Now, I've been accused of bein'

56:00.113 --> 56:01.948
some kind of an environmentalist

56:01.980 --> 56:05.051
and a green peace
person, a crusader.

56:08.254 --> 56:10.957
But that's not fair,
I don't rate that.

56:10.989 --> 56:13.225
I'm just an American farmer.

56:13.259 --> 56:16.329
I do battle with Mother
Earth every damn day.

56:16.361 --> 56:17.730
Thank you, Mr. Stern.

56:17.763 --> 56:18.832
Your witness.

56:22.902 --> 56:23.904
Mr. Stern.

56:26.939 --> 56:28.141
You come here often?

56:28.174 --> 56:29.409
Yes, I do.

56:29.442 --> 56:31.111
I like to look in
on things myself.

56:31.143 --> 56:32.812
Hm, that's nice.

56:32.844 --> 56:34.913
And your business,
that which you accused

56:34.946 --> 56:38.317
my client of ruining, who looks
after that for you all day

56:38.350 --> 56:39.785
- every day you're here?
- I have a foreman.

56:39.819 --> 56:41.921
His name is Santiago
Compestella.

56:41.953 --> 56:43.856
Santiago Compestella.

56:46.125 --> 56:47.861
Santiago Compestella.

56:50.062 --> 56:51.297
All right.

56:51.330 --> 56:53.466
If you should somehow
prove your case

56:53.498 --> 56:56.102
and be awarded $2,000,000,000,

56:56.134 --> 56:58.303
would Shore Energy have
to close its doors...

56:58.337 --> 56:59.305
Objection, Your Honor.

56:59.337 --> 57:01.006
- Irrelevant.
- Sustained.

57:01.040 --> 57:03.509
Putting half a community
of hard working patriots

57:03.542 --> 57:06.178
out of a job because
of one man's selfish...

57:06.212 --> 57:07.380
Objection, Your Honor.

57:07.413 --> 57:08.314
Move to strike.

57:08.346 --> 57:09.248
Sustained.

57:09.281 --> 57:11.417
Miss Gore, that is enough.

57:25.564 --> 57:28.433
There's an alien
in these parts,

57:28.466 --> 57:31.238
of the illegal Mexican variety.

57:33.205 --> 57:34.039
Mm hm.

57:35.841 --> 57:37.376
Santiago Compestella.

57:40.279 --> 57:41.114
Hm?

57:42.214 --> 57:45.350
But don't worry, I've taken
the necessary precautions

57:45.384 --> 57:49.489
to make sure that he'll
be deported, tonight.

57:49.522 --> 57:53.092
Are you trying to impress me,

57:53.125 --> 57:56.228
with your parochial
intimidation tactics?

57:56.261 --> 57:58.030
Oh, you're so cute.

58:41.207 --> 58:42.042
Oh.

58:43.308 --> 58:45.911
Touch me again.

58:45.944 --> 58:46.580
What?

58:50.283 --> 58:51.084
Like this?

59:10.435 --> 59:12.872
You know, I could protect you.

59:17.243 --> 59:19.478
You're an excuse of a man.

59:19.511 --> 59:20.546
A sad excuse?

59:21.379 --> 59:22.381
Poor excuse?

59:23.950 --> 59:25.185
A drunk excuse?

59:28.120 --> 59:30.457
Little piece of free advice.

59:31.524 --> 59:34.426
When you're offered
a shot of salvation,

59:34.460 --> 59:36.997
you should probably take it.

59:38.029 --> 59:39.298
Slither away.

59:42.033 --> 59:43.236
Slither.

59:43.268 --> 59:45.205
Oh, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi.

59:46.471 --> 59:47.306
Yeah.

59:48.408 --> 59:52.545
You have no idea how high
I intend to fly do you?

59:52.578 --> 59:54.381
Snakes don't fly.

59:55.281 --> 59:57.116
Well, watch me soar.

01:00:21.473 --> 01:00:22.475
Venmo?

01:00:22.507 --> 01:00:24.143
I don't have it.

01:00:24.176 --> 01:00:26.446
Instagram ,

01:00:26.478 --> 01:00:29.681
Facebook.

01:00:37.223 --> 01:00:38.291
What can I get you?

01:00:38.323 --> 01:00:40.092
Tallest glass
of beer there ever was.

01:00:40.125 --> 01:00:41.326
Comin' right up.

01:01:00.413 --> 01:01:02.282
Santiago Compestella.

01:01:03.482 --> 01:01:07.152
My, my, my, you are a
long ways from home.

01:01:08.486 --> 01:01:09.555
You have a problem?

01:01:09.587 --> 01:01:11.690
Back off.

01:01:11.723 --> 01:01:14.459
Juan, Carlos, Rodriguez.

01:01:14.493 --> 01:01:16.562
How goes it boys?

01:01:16.594 --> 01:01:18.031
And how's your mama?

01:01:18.064 --> 01:01:20.632
She must be missin'
Juarez somethin' fierce.

01:01:20.665 --> 01:01:22.602
What about you, Gloria?

01:01:23.502 --> 01:01:25.605
Do you pine for chihuahua?

01:01:25.638 --> 01:01:27.373
Not them.

01:01:27.406 --> 01:01:28.541
I'm warning you.

01:01:28.573 --> 01:01:31.777
Oh.

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:33.546
He's warning me.

01:01:33.578 --> 01:01:35.614
Well, I guess I better explain

01:01:35.647 --> 01:01:39.051
a little somethin'
to you taco lovers.

01:01:39.085 --> 01:01:41.320
This is not your country.

01:01:41.352 --> 01:01:43.722
This is not your
world, it's mine.

01:01:43.756 --> 01:01:48.627
And I will use, abuse and
discard you just as I see fit.

01:01:54.632 --> 01:01:56.669
So step up or walk on.

01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:06.211
You know,

01:02:10.482 --> 01:02:13.618
you're not gonna be able to
get away with this anymore.

01:02:13.652 --> 01:02:16.522
Said the Indian
to the calvary.

01:02:16.555 --> 01:02:18.091
I tell you what,

01:02:19.658 --> 01:02:21.294
why don't you put

01:02:21.326 --> 01:02:24.830
that stinking Mexican mouth
all over my big sloppy...

01:02:30.301 --> 01:02:33.638
Well, holy shit, we
got an uppity wetback.

01:02:36.174 --> 01:02:39.078
I hope you suck as
soft as you hit.

01:02:43.616 --> 01:02:45.551
That felt good, I gotta say,

01:02:45.584 --> 01:02:49.721
but can you please, can you
please just give me one more.

01:02:49.754 --> 01:02:51.857
Come on, hit me again
you spent bitch.

01:02:59.564 --> 01:03:00.398
Holy shit.

01:03:02.768 --> 01:03:05.505
Okay, that'll do.

01:03:06.939 --> 01:03:08.373
What was that?

01:03:18.317 --> 01:03:21.521
This car belongs to that.

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.749
Is this true?

01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:51.951
The assault?

01:03:51.984 --> 01:03:53.585
No.

01:03:53.618 --> 01:03:57.689
But the arson ,

01:03:57.723 --> 01:03:58.658
yes.

01:04:00.926 --> 01:04:03.462
I seen your papers, Santi.

01:04:04.663 --> 01:04:05.665
You saw papers.

01:04:05.698 --> 01:04:06.866
Forgeries?

01:04:06.899 --> 01:04:09.801
- They were good.
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:09.835 --> 01:04:12.939
Yeah, real good
and really stupid.

01:04:12.971 --> 01:04:15.341
How could you have done...

01:04:16.442 --> 01:04:17.443
You son of a bitch.

01:04:17.475 --> 01:04:19.945
You know how this is gonna look.

01:04:21.513 --> 01:04:25.651
Tell me, Fred, how
is this gonna look?

01:04:25.683 --> 01:04:29.721
Like I'm going around
burning things in the town?

01:04:29.754 --> 01:04:32.224
No, I'm an illegal with a bone

01:04:32.257 --> 01:04:33.725
- to pick and I got
- It's gonna look like

01:04:33.759 --> 01:04:35.228
- a lotta reason why I should.
- I've got a damn terrorist

01:04:35.261 --> 01:04:37.330
running my farm.

01:04:37.363 --> 01:04:38.564
This is about the case.

01:04:38.596 --> 01:04:39.531
Yeah, of course
it's about the case.

01:04:39.564 --> 01:04:40.765
What did you think it was about.

01:04:42.468 --> 01:04:43.469
I mean, how could you have been

01:04:43.502 --> 01:04:44.971
so ungrateful to do this to me?

01:04:45.004 --> 01:04:46.272
Sir, can you take me back

01:04:46.305 --> 01:04:47.772
- to my cell please?
- To me?

01:04:47.806 --> 01:04:48.540
- Santi, really, please.
- You know what

01:04:48.573 --> 01:04:50.776
- I'm gonna miss, Fred?
- Oh, what?

01:04:50.808 --> 01:04:54.247
You know?

01:04:56.448 --> 01:04:57.283
My phone.

01:05:15.801 --> 01:05:16.602
You okay?

01:05:16.634 --> 01:05:17.837
You look like shit.

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:18.971
I must've called
40 times last night.

01:05:19.004 --> 01:05:20.672
Why the hell didn't you pick up?

01:05:20.705 --> 01:05:23.008
I had to shut off the phone
so I could focus on today.

01:05:23.042 --> 01:05:24.576
We're gonna sink a showboat.

01:05:24.609 --> 01:05:25.810
Ralph, you need
to know something.

01:05:25.843 --> 01:05:27.446
- It's...
- All rise.

01:05:48.834 --> 01:05:49.969
Mr. Aegis?

01:05:50.002 --> 01:05:50.969
Are those
gonna be the witnesses?

01:05:51.002 --> 01:05:53.006
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:56.409
Good morning, Mr. Gardner.

01:05:56.442 --> 01:05:57.743
Good morning, Ralph.

01:05:57.776 --> 01:05:59.411
Did you or did you
not make my client,

01:05:59.444 --> 01:06:02.814
Fred Stern, an offer
to buy his pore space?

01:06:02.848 --> 01:06:05.317
I just wanted to help him out.

01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:07.986
It's kinda what I do.

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:11.924
And this is before you
actually worked for Shore Oil?

01:06:11.957 --> 01:06:13.625
Do you remember a time when

01:06:13.658 --> 01:06:16.628
you didn't have to work some
place to help out a neighbor?

01:06:16.661 --> 01:06:19.064
So you thought you
were doing Mr. Stern

01:06:19.098 --> 01:06:20.900
a favor by covering up the fact

01:06:20.933 --> 01:06:23.035
that Shore Oil was
polluting his farm?

01:06:23.067 --> 01:06:24.437
The fact?

01:06:24.469 --> 01:06:26.605
Come on, Ralph, you're
better than that.

01:06:26.638 --> 01:06:27.706
Excuse me, Sir,
are you now denying

01:06:27.739 --> 01:06:30.009
- that you made Mr. Stern...
- I'm not denying anything.

01:06:30.042 --> 01:06:31.911
You got your
scientific mumbo jumbo

01:06:31.944 --> 01:06:36.482
and your test tubes and
beakers and whatnot.

01:06:36.515 --> 01:06:38.850
But I actually know this man.

01:06:38.884 --> 01:06:40.753
I worked for him
everyday in high school

01:06:40.785 --> 01:06:43.555
in between football practice
and helpin' out my mom.

01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:46.826
You paint a heroic
picture of yourself, Sir.

01:06:47.826 --> 01:06:50.029
I just like to look
for the good in folks,

01:06:50.062 --> 01:06:52.765
and Fred, Fred is a class act.

01:06:53.966 --> 01:06:55.634
But times are tough.

01:06:56.835 --> 01:07:00.906
Money is tight and ever
since Nancy passed away,

01:07:00.939 --> 01:07:04.944
and the fact that he's had
an illegal runnin' his farm,

01:07:04.977 --> 01:07:06.612
I figured he needed the money.

01:07:06.645 --> 01:07:07.780
Objection, Your Honor.

01:07:07.812 --> 01:07:09.381
- That's irrelevant.
- What?

01:07:09.415 --> 01:07:10.049
It's true.

01:07:10.082 --> 01:07:11.616
Move to strike.

01:07:11.649 --> 01:07:12.417
Sustained.

01:07:12.451 --> 01:07:13.686
Control your witness,

01:07:13.718 --> 01:07:14.152
- Mr. Aegis.
- Would it were possible,

01:07:14.185 --> 01:07:15.086
Your Honor.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.455
Do you not want them to hear?

01:07:16.488 --> 01:07:17.957
What is it that
Abraham Lincoln said?

01:07:17.989 --> 01:07:19.924
Do you remember the words of
our President Abraham Lincoln?

01:07:19.957 --> 01:07:22.694
"The truth will set you free."

01:07:22.727 --> 01:07:24.629
Actually, Mr.
Gardner that was Jesus.

01:07:24.663 --> 01:07:25.498
John 8:32.

01:07:26.998 --> 01:07:28.433
Oh.

01:07:28.466 --> 01:07:30.969
Well, I do think there
are more subtle ways

01:07:31.002 --> 01:07:34.006
to let anyone know that
you go to church on Sunday.

01:07:34.038 --> 01:07:34.973
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:07:35.006 --> 01:07:35.907
No further question.

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.676
I am done with this witness.

01:07:37.709 --> 01:07:39.111
Thank you, Ralph.

01:07:40.111 --> 01:07:41.913
Miss Gore.

01:07:41.946 --> 01:07:43.181
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:07:43.214 --> 01:07:45.017
Alex, pleasure.

01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:46.718
It's all mine.

01:07:46.752 --> 01:07:48.954
I am just happy to finally
set the record straight.

01:07:48.986 --> 01:07:49.821
Great.

01:07:51.022 --> 01:07:52.158
Tell us about that
night at Ozzie's.

01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:53.625
What happened?

01:07:53.658 --> 01:07:55.927
He said and I quote,

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.430
"To hell with the
whole damn valley.

01:07:58.464 --> 01:08:01.933
"If Shore wants what I
got, they can have it all.

01:08:01.966 --> 01:08:05.003
"But I need to take them
for every last cent I can.

01:08:05.036 --> 01:08:08.107
"70,000's my minimum,
you understand?

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.775
"I want more."

01:08:09.808 --> 01:08:12.945
I never woulda thought that
he was talkin' billions.

01:08:12.977 --> 01:08:14.813
Screw you, Stern!

01:08:14.846 --> 01:08:15.980
Order!

01:08:16.013 --> 01:08:17.216
Order!

01:08:24.188 --> 01:08:25.657
I'd like to
enter into evidence

01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:28.861
an arrest report for
Santiago Compestella,

01:08:28.894 --> 01:08:30.062
- an illegal alien
- This is what I was trying

01:08:30.095 --> 01:08:31.197
- who has been
- to tell you about

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:32.598
- on Mr. Stern's payroll
- this morning.

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:33.765
- for over 30 years.
- Objection, Your Honor.

01:08:33.799 --> 01:08:34.600
Irrelevant.

01:08:34.631 --> 01:08:35.733
Sustained.

01:08:35.768 --> 01:08:40.706
Miss Gore, Mr. Aegis, join
me in chambers immediately.

01:08:41.907 --> 01:08:44.542
Miss Gore, I will not have
grandstanding in my courtroom.

01:08:44.576 --> 01:08:47.046
Your Honor, I was simply
making evidence available.

01:08:47.078 --> 01:08:47.979
Oh, come on, Olive.

01:08:48.013 --> 01:08:49.215
You wanna play dirty, fine.

01:08:49.247 --> 01:08:51.649
But for God sakes
show a little class.

01:08:51.683 --> 01:08:54.053
Compestella's crimes
must be made known

01:08:54.086 --> 01:08:55.854
- to the jury.
- It's already public record,

01:08:55.888 --> 01:08:57.555
Your Honor and need I remind

01:08:57.589 --> 01:08:59.658
my esteemed colleague that being

01:08:59.689 --> 01:09:02.862
an undocumented
immigrant is not a crime.

01:09:02.894 --> 01:09:05.063
Yet, but arson
and assault are.

01:09:05.095 --> 01:09:06.764
Also, there's this.

01:09:06.796 --> 01:09:07.599
Susan?

01:09:07.631 --> 01:09:08.834
What's this all about?

01:09:08.867 --> 01:09:09.868
This is new evidence
I would like Your Honor

01:09:09.902 --> 01:09:12.671
to review before we
enter into public record.

01:09:12.703 --> 01:09:15.139
Oh my, what a concept.

01:09:15.171 --> 01:09:17.142
Would you
like to use the restroom

01:09:17.175 --> 01:09:18.911
before the movie starts?

01:09:18.943 --> 01:09:20.645
I think I can hold it.

01:09:20.679 --> 01:09:21.680
We'll see.

01:09:24.715 --> 01:09:26.151
Why is he naked?

01:09:26.184 --> 01:09:29.555
Technically
he's in a towel.

01:09:30.854 --> 01:09:32.959
Was in a towel.

01:09:33.959 --> 01:09:36.828
Ralph, it's
just hearsay, right?

01:09:36.862 --> 01:09:37.696
That's all they got.

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:39.499
You said so yourself.

01:09:40.165 --> 01:09:41.064
What are you talkin' about?

01:09:41.099 --> 01:09:42.535
They just knocked us out.

01:09:42.568 --> 01:09:45.571
Well, it's my word
against his, right?

01:09:45.604 --> 01:09:47.206
Did you say it?

01:09:48.738 --> 01:09:49.575
Okay.

01:09:50.742 --> 01:09:53.178
So, what do you
wanna do now, lie?

01:09:53.211 --> 01:09:54.880
No, I wanna win.

01:09:54.912 --> 01:09:56.014
I gotta win this, Ralph.

01:09:56.047 --> 01:09:58.149
They're poisoning my water.

01:09:58.183 --> 01:10:00.719
You've had an undocumented
immigrant running

01:10:00.751 --> 01:10:01.852
your farm for 30 years and now

01:10:01.886 --> 01:10:04.956
they have a security video
of you running around naked

01:10:04.989 --> 01:10:07.292
and threatening Gardner
with a golf club.

01:10:07.326 --> 01:10:08.961
Oh, come on, I just...

01:10:08.993 --> 01:10:11.630
You know what that jury sees
now when they look at you?

01:10:11.662 --> 01:10:13.933
A con artist, a thief.

01:10:13.965 --> 01:10:16.167
And when they get a load
of that video in court,

01:10:16.201 --> 01:10:18.203
you're gonna look
like a lunatic, too.

01:10:18.236 --> 01:10:21.040
So, go ahead, double down,
lie, be like everybody else,

01:10:21.072 --> 01:10:23.142
but don't expect me
to be a part of it.

01:10:23.175 --> 01:10:24.076
It's over.

01:10:24.108 --> 01:10:25.777
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:28.112
No, it does no end like this.

01:10:28.145 --> 01:10:30.114
What, what, do they
get to drag me through

01:10:30.148 --> 01:10:31.984
the dirt and steal
everything I've got

01:10:32.017 --> 01:10:34.053
and then they just
get to walk away?

01:10:34.086 --> 01:10:35.955
Maybe we can
work out some kind

01:10:35.987 --> 01:10:37.789
of settlement and
you can start over.

01:10:37.822 --> 01:10:39.057
Yeah, well, that's probably

01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:40.291
the way you killed
the Pinto, right?

01:10:40.325 --> 01:10:42.126
With the deal?

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.796
Some kind of dragon
slayer you are.

01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:46.297
Oh, go to hell.

01:10:46.331 --> 01:10:49.001
All you ever really cared
about was the money anyway.

01:10:49.033 --> 01:10:51.103
All you ever cared
about was bein' relevant.

01:10:51.135 --> 01:10:53.004
Am I right?

01:10:53.037 --> 01:10:53.839
Has been.

01:10:54.906 --> 01:10:56.075
At least I was.

01:11:04.282 --> 01:11:06.085
Fred, you still there?

01:11:08.053 --> 01:11:09.787
He's through.

01:11:09.821 --> 01:11:11.256
Offer the settlement.

01:11:11.288 --> 01:11:13.392
Is she even necessary anymore?

01:11:13.425 --> 01:11:14.260
Be nice.

01:11:15.227 --> 01:11:16.795
We got him ball the balls.

01:11:16.827 --> 01:11:18.663
Now you take his head.

01:11:19.764 --> 01:11:23.701
You drank the
Kool-Aid, haven't you?

01:11:23.734 --> 01:11:25.170
Alex is right.

01:11:25.202 --> 01:11:26.138
Who's gonna come
after us after

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:28.172
we burn him into the ground?

01:11:28.206 --> 01:11:29.208
Nobody.

01:11:30.075 --> 01:11:32.176
His lawyer.

01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:35.881
He finds somethin',
some proof that we knew.

01:11:36.915 --> 01:11:39.285
What, are you gonna tell him?

01:11:40.818 --> 01:11:42.153
This is bullshit.

01:11:42.187 --> 01:11:44.055
I got a thing to get to.

01:11:44.089 --> 01:11:46.257
So, you can handle
this, right, Boss?

01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:47.727
Oh, yes, Sir.

01:11:53.165 --> 01:11:54.332
- Gigi, I...
- Oh,

01:11:54.366 --> 01:11:55.801
I've been meanin' to tell you,

01:11:55.834 --> 01:11:57.135
I'm gonna reach
out to your firm.

01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:58.836
I'm gonna make a
point of tellin'

01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:01.372
the partners how optimistic
I am about your future.

01:12:13.417 --> 01:12:15.254
Do you think
you can do my job?

01:12:17.054 --> 01:12:19.157
Oh, babe, I already am.

01:12:20.358 --> 01:12:22.161
It's feelin' pretty permanent.

01:12:22.193 --> 01:12:23.261
Like death?

01:12:24.729 --> 01:12:26.864
Shoulda took my advice.

01:12:26.898 --> 01:12:29.234
Don't worry, you'll
get your stock options.

01:12:29.267 --> 01:12:32.071
Golden parachute, all that shit.

01:12:32.104 --> 01:12:34.206
That is if we win.

01:12:34.238 --> 01:12:35.306
If we lose...

01:12:37.007 --> 01:12:38.077
Go to hell.

01:12:39.411 --> 01:12:40.779
I like it here.

01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:57.496
Oh come on, Wally.

01:12:57.528 --> 01:13:00.732
You know I'm not
what they say I am.

01:13:40.971 --> 01:13:42.840
You can't just die.

01:13:42.873 --> 01:13:43.776
Yeah, I'm right here.

01:13:43.809 --> 01:13:45.210
I'm right here, yeah, yeah.

01:13:45.242 --> 01:13:46.477
I'm gonna sit you up.

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:47.312
I got to.

01:13:49.581 --> 01:13:51.216
It's
too late, Fred.

01:13:51.248 --> 01:13:52.350
No!

01:13:52.384 --> 01:13:54.319
Hell, I mean, no!

01:13:54.352 --> 01:13:55.254
Get over here.

01:13:55.287 --> 01:13:56.088
Mr. Stern.

01:14:02.527 --> 01:14:04.196
Come here, come on.

01:14:15.172 --> 01:14:17.309
Santi, what am I gonna do?

01:14:22.179 --> 01:14:23.915
Oh, come on, come on.

01:14:25.015 --> 01:14:26.184
Don't do this.

01:14:29.254 --> 01:14:30.288
Please, please.

01:14:37.127 --> 01:14:39.799
It's been quite a spell, I know.

01:14:43.367 --> 01:14:46.805
You might not like me
much anymore, girl.

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:52.044
God, I miss the hell outta ya.

01:15:20.938 --> 01:15:22.173
I'm not here.

01:15:23.675 --> 01:15:25.344
You better not be.

01:15:27.011 --> 01:15:28.346
Quiet, Freddy.

01:15:29.346 --> 01:15:30.950
Listen to me now.

01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:39.957
Who's ready?

01:15:39.991 --> 01:15:41.460
- Me!
- You?

01:15:41.492 --> 01:15:43.160
I'm ready, girl.

01:15:43.193 --> 01:15:46.364
Shore
Energy, we thank you!

01:16:17.996 --> 01:16:19.398
What are you doin'?

01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:22.401
Same thing
as you, killing Gigi.

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.997
Mr. Stern, nice weekend?

01:16:53.031 --> 01:16:54.466
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:16:54.498 --> 01:16:59.037
Yeah, listen, Ralph, I'm
sorry I called you a has been.

01:16:59.571 --> 01:17:01.105
I was way outta line.

01:17:01.139 --> 01:17:04.509
If anything you're a
, you're an is now.

01:17:04.541 --> 01:17:08.079
Okay, Fred, but I'm still
not gonna let you lie.

01:17:08.112 --> 01:17:10.114
You're not gonna have to.

01:17:12.617 --> 01:17:14.553
I'm gonna ask for a recess so

01:17:14.586 --> 01:17:15.554
we can start working
on a settlement.

01:17:15.586 --> 01:17:17.288
- No, Ralph, I don't want a...
- Fred, we've got

01:17:17.322 --> 01:17:18.556
a very good chance
for a settlement.

01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:19.224
Not yet.

01:17:20.692 --> 01:17:22.394
This is not going well for us.

01:17:22.426 --> 01:17:25.162
I know, I told you in the
bathroom I wanna win, okay?

01:17:25.196 --> 01:17:27.431
Get Gigi Cutler on the stand.

01:17:30.167 --> 01:17:32.371
You know
something I don't.

01:17:32.403 --> 01:17:33.270
Get her up there.

01:17:33.304 --> 01:17:34.105
Okay.

01:17:37.541 --> 01:17:40.678
Your Honor, the plaintiff
calls Miss Regina Cutler

01:17:40.711 --> 01:17:42.179
to the stand, please.

01:17:44.215 --> 01:17:47.586
Miss
Cutler, to the stand.

01:17:47.618 --> 01:17:49.520
I'm not even ready for
what this is gonna be.

01:18:07.538 --> 01:18:09.674
Raise
your right hand.

01:18:09.706 --> 01:18:10.508
Regina Cutler...

01:18:10.541 --> 01:18:12.109
My mother was Regina.

01:18:12.143 --> 01:18:13.278
Me?

01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:14.446
Gigi.

01:18:14.479 --> 01:18:16.515
Gigi Cutler, do
you swear to tell the truth,

01:18:16.547 --> 01:18:18.282
the whole truth and
nothing but the truth?

01:18:18.315 --> 01:18:19.550
So help me God.

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:23.788
Good morning, Miss Cutler.

01:18:23.822 --> 01:18:25.190
Thank you for joining us.

01:18:25.223 --> 01:18:27.591
Ask the question, Aegis.

01:18:27.625 --> 01:18:29.161
Miss Cutler.

01:18:29.193 --> 01:18:31.662
Lance, let the man do his job.

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:37.135
Come on.

01:18:38.269 --> 01:18:39.104
Ask.

01:18:41.572 --> 01:18:43.707
Very well, Ma'am.

01:18:43.741 --> 01:18:48.747
Did Shore Oil continuously
poison Fred Stern's ground water

01:18:49.581 --> 01:18:50.681
for 10 years?

01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:00.591
Yes.

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:03.861
Order.

01:19:04.862 --> 01:19:06.764
Order.

01:19:06.797 --> 01:19:08.200
Order.

01:19:10.902 --> 01:19:12.504
Just unbelievable.

01:19:15.273 --> 01:19:16.641
I learned the night before

01:19:16.674 --> 01:19:19.644
that you man was under
suspicion by the local police,

01:19:19.676 --> 01:19:22.647
for arson and falsifying
evidence against one

01:19:22.679 --> 01:19:24.482
of Stern's laborers.

01:19:24.515 --> 01:19:26.617
Knowing the damage this
would cause our case,

01:19:26.651 --> 01:19:28.553
not to mention our reputation,

01:19:28.586 --> 01:19:31.290
I had only one option, end it.

01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:33.792
Yes.

01:19:33.825 --> 01:19:37.696
Shore Oil poisoned Mr.
Stern's ground water.

01:19:54.679 --> 01:19:57.248
Thank you for
that, Miss Cutler.

01:19:57.282 --> 01:19:59.218
Now, as to the coverup,

01:20:02.452 --> 01:20:06.724
can you tell the court why
Mr. Alex Gardner offered

01:20:07.791 --> 01:20:10.495
to buy Mr. Stern's pore space?

01:20:16.501 --> 01:20:18.937
Alex Gardner didn't
work for us at the time.

01:20:18.970 --> 01:20:21.706
He was either
lying to Mr. Stern,

01:20:21.738 --> 01:20:22.806
or he's lying to the court.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:23.875
She's lying!

01:20:23.907 --> 01:20:25.209
Mr. Gardner, I will hold you

01:20:25.242 --> 01:20:26.710
- in contempt!
- You filthy bitch!

01:20:26.743 --> 01:20:28.246
- Contempt!
- Oh boy.

01:20:28.278 --> 01:20:29.480
Be
silent, Mr. Gardner.

01:20:29.514 --> 01:20:30.315
Well, hold...

01:20:30.348 --> 01:20:31.248
Bailiff?

01:20:31.282 --> 01:20:31.783
I run this shit hole town.

01:20:32.884 --> 01:20:34.719
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:20:34.751 --> 01:20:35.754
Oo.

01:20:36.688 --> 01:20:38.223
No, no!

01:20:38.255 --> 01:20:39.857
- Oh my God.
- Un-fuckin'-believable.

01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:42.560
- You're hurting him.
- Fuckin' lying bitch!

01:20:42.594 --> 01:20:43.862
- Alex!
- Fuck you!

01:20:43.894 --> 01:20:44.795
Stop movin', Sir.

01:20:44.828 --> 01:20:45.729
- Come on.
- Fuck you!

01:20:45.763 --> 01:20:46.797
You blamed it on Gardner?

01:20:46.831 --> 01:20:48.700
No one would believe that shit.

01:20:48.733 --> 01:20:53.471
It as on record and he'd
never get a chance to deny it.

01:20:54.639 --> 01:20:56.775
We settled with
Stern the next day.

01:20:56.808 --> 01:20:58.210
Case closed.

01:20:58.242 --> 01:20:59.544
Thank you, Miss Cutler.

01:20:59.577 --> 01:21:00.679
No further questions,
Your Honor.

01:21:00.711 --> 01:21:02.446
Witness is excused.

01:21:02.479 --> 01:21:04.348
Counselors approach.

01:21:04.381 --> 01:21:06.884
All right, thank
you very much.

01:21:11.889 --> 01:21:13.658
Your Honor, in light of
whatever that just was...

01:21:13.690 --> 01:21:14.459
We finished?

01:21:16.027 --> 01:21:17.629
Yeah, looks that
way, doesn't it?

01:21:20.465 --> 01:21:23.702
I'll have your settlement
delivered this evening.

01:21:23.734 --> 01:21:25.469
I don't want your money.

01:21:25.502 --> 01:21:28.773
I don't wanna give it to you,

01:21:28.805 --> 01:21:33.812
but the Devil is not the
Devil unless he takes his due.

01:21:36.781 --> 01:21:37.815
No hard feelings.

01:21:37.849 --> 01:21:39.417
Can I buy you a drink?

01:21:39.450 --> 01:21:40.452
Kinda early.

01:21:40.484 --> 01:21:41.286
Where?

01:21:41.318 --> 01:21:41.952
You know where.

01:21:41.986 --> 01:21:43.354
I'll see ya.

01:21:44.721 --> 01:21:45.756
Still hot.

01:21:46.724 --> 01:21:47.559
Mr. Stern.

01:21:48.826 --> 01:21:51.296
Can you explain what
just happened here?

01:21:51.328 --> 01:21:54.498
Well, she admitted
that they did it,

01:21:56.634 --> 01:21:58.770
and now they're gonna
fill in those ponds

01:21:58.803 --> 01:22:02.773
and they're gonna
clear Santi's name.

01:22:02.806 --> 01:22:03.875
We settled.

01:22:03.907 --> 01:22:05.442
What does she get?

01:22:05.475 --> 01:22:09.848
I don't know, and I
don't really wanna know.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:10.681
Yeah.

01:22:11.849 --> 01:22:14.486
Ralph, hang on for a second.

01:22:14.519 --> 01:22:15.720
I got you somethin'.

01:22:15.752 --> 01:22:17.054
Oh?

01:22:24.461 --> 01:22:25.729
For me?

01:22:25.763 --> 01:22:26.730
You shouldn't have.

01:22:26.764 --> 01:22:27.832
Well, maybe not.

01:22:29.901 --> 01:22:32.037
What's this,
the Eiffel Tower?

01:22:32.069 --> 01:22:33.404
Well, it was the closest thing

01:22:33.438 --> 01:22:37.042
I could find that
looked like an oil rig.

01:22:37.075 --> 01:22:39.711
I thought it'd make
a nice hood ornament

01:22:39.743 --> 01:22:41.746
for your Ford Pinto.

01:22:41.778 --> 01:22:43.848
It will indeed.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.349
Thank you, Fred.

01:22:45.382 --> 01:22:47.551
You're more than welcome.

01:22:47.585 --> 01:22:50.956
Just sorry we couldn't
slay the big dragon.

01:22:52.090 --> 01:22:55.394
We tried, but we'll
always have Paris.

01:22:56.493 --> 01:22:57.828
Yeah, I guess.

01:22:59.630 --> 01:23:02.033
Well, congratulations, Fred.

01:23:02.065 --> 01:23:06.337
Mr. Stern, these
proceedings are concluded.

01:23:06.371 --> 01:23:07.505
It's been real.

01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:29.928
And my boy, what
happened there?

01:23:29.961 --> 01:23:31.529
Hey girly,
you come to dance

01:23:31.562 --> 01:23:33.398
with me in the pale moonlight?

01:23:36.968 --> 01:23:37.902
I've come to say goodbye.

01:23:37.934 --> 01:23:39.603
Ah.

01:23:39.636 --> 01:23:41.406
So you're leavin'.

01:23:41.438 --> 01:23:43.075
Well, it's about time.

01:23:44.474 --> 01:23:46.111
I'm gonna
settle with Stern.

01:23:49.413 --> 01:23:50.748
Oh shit, Gigi.

01:23:53.084 --> 01:23:54.719
You once gave me
some free advice.

01:23:54.751 --> 01:23:57.154
Yeah, what was that?

01:23:57.188 --> 01:24:00.959
You get a shot at
salvation, you take it.

01:24:01.925 --> 01:24:02.760
Right.

01:24:05.696 --> 01:24:06.965
So this is your shot, huh?

01:24:27.785 --> 01:24:28.886
Please don't.

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.456
Fly now you piece of shit.

01:24:37.094 --> 01:24:40.765
At Ezekiel 22:27,
we're told that princes

01:24:40.797 --> 01:24:42.834
who tear up their victims,

01:24:42.867 --> 01:24:46.705
shedding blood, destroying
souls all for gain.

01:24:47.938 --> 01:24:52.543
Your man fell free to such,
discovered and disgraced.

01:24:52.577 --> 01:24:54.712
He didn't fight the inevitable.

01:24:54.745 --> 01:24:58.683
He did the honorable thing
and exited the scene.

01:24:58.715 --> 01:25:00.451
That guy was a pro.

01:25:01.486 --> 01:25:02.787
Consummate.

01:25:02.819 --> 01:25:05.456
What, so he just vanished?

01:25:12.697 --> 01:25:14.599
I'm sure we'll
hear from him again.

01:25:14.631 --> 01:25:15.899
At the end of the day,

01:25:15.933 --> 01:25:18.470
having narrowly
escaped total disaster,

01:25:18.502 --> 01:25:21.773
we ended our battle
with the Devil.

01:25:21.805 --> 01:25:26.210
Suffering the insignificant
loss of 1% of his ask.

01:25:30.848 --> 01:25:33.917
I believe, gentlemen,
you'll agree,

01:25:37.654 --> 01:25:40.023
that $20,000,000 is
a small price to pay

01:25:40.056 --> 01:25:43.929
to keep our good work
goin' and our souls intact.

01:25:47.864 --> 01:25:50.268
So that's your story?

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:51.769
It's a whopper.

01:25:53.537 --> 01:25:56.139
If you like that kinda burger.

01:25:56.172 --> 01:26:01.179
And what if we ask Alex
and all of their side of it?

01:26:02.112 --> 01:26:03.080
Feel free to do so.

01:26:04.047 --> 01:26:07.117
I have kept Olive on
as a legal consultant,

01:26:07.151 --> 01:26:10.255
and Alex, he's on
location in Africa.

01:26:12.023 --> 01:26:13.024
So you stabbed him in the back

01:26:13.056 --> 01:26:14.959
and then you bought him off?

01:26:14.992 --> 01:26:16.027
Respect.

01:26:16.993 --> 01:26:18.996
Well, it's a cryin'
shame that we can't hear

01:26:19.029 --> 01:26:23.033
what our dearly departed
thought about all this.

01:26:30.575 --> 01:26:32.076
But we can.

01:26:39.649 --> 01:26:41.853
Big Boss sent me.

01:26:41.885 --> 01:26:42.720
Ruination.

01:26:44.087 --> 01:26:47.325
What do you think this
whole case is for, huh?

01:26:47.358 --> 01:26:49.727
Why do you think the
farmer's askin' for business?

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.062
'Cause I made it so.

01:26:51.095 --> 01:26:52.030
Me.

01:27:32.202 --> 01:27:34.805
All right, gentlemen.

01:27:38.975 --> 01:27:40.812
Let's talk about Iran.

01:28:44.241 --> 01:28:45.777
It's good to see you.

01:28:58.755 --> 01:29:00.457
So what's the protocol?

01:29:00.491 --> 01:29:02.359
Well, traditionally you have

01:29:02.393 --> 01:29:05.663
to ask for permission
to come aboard.

01:29:48.272 --> 01:29:49.940
Give me that thing.

01:29:49.974 --> 01:29:52.276
This is your last
selfie you'll ever take.

01:29:52.309 --> 01:29:53.811
No!

01:29:53.844 --> 01:29:55.179
Shit!

01:29:55.211 --> 01:29:56.880
What, are you crazy?

01:29:56.913 --> 01:29:58.014
Free at last.

01:29:58.047 --> 01:30:00.184
You're free at least.

01:34:05.429 --> 01:34:06.998
Well that
ought to get it.

01:36:56.832 --> 01:36:58.501
I don't believe this.

01:36:58.535 --> 01:37:00.703
We're in the middle of the
Great Pacific garbage patch.

01:37:00.737 --> 01:37:02.672
You gotta be kiddin' me.

01:37:02.706 --> 01:37:04.608
After all this, this
is where we end up.

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:07.243
Don't look so
surprised, Mr. Water Bottles.

01:37:07.277 --> 01:37:08.812
Oh, Santi.

01:37:08.845 --> 01:37:09.813
Oh, look at us.

01:37:09.845 --> 01:37:11.581
You know what?

01:37:11.614 --> 01:37:12.815
I'm posting this one.

01:37:12.849 --> 01:37:14.251
Oh, really?

01:37:14.283 --> 01:37:17.688
And just how are you
going to do that, huh?
