WEBVTT

00:15.750 --> 00:17.000
EVERYBODY!

00:18.959 --> 00:20.208
THE SWIMMING POOL!
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE

00:20.208 --> 00:21.667
WHAT THEY DID
TO THE SWIMMING POOL.

00:29.417 --> 00:31.250
MY! YOU DON'T
SEE THIS EVERY DAY.

00:42.708 --> 00:45.041
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

00:45.041 --> 00:46.708
THAT'S MY BOAT...

00:46.708 --> 00:49.125
AND MY DOG.

00:53.917 --> 00:55.000
WHO COULD HAVE POSSIBLY?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.417
[LAUGHING]
I SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THIS.

00:57.417 --> 00:59.708
DAWSON, WHILE WE
DO RECOGNIZE
YOUR TALENT

00:59.708 --> 01:00.875
AS A WITTY
PRACTICAL JOKER,

01:00.875 --> 01:03.333
I THINK THAT THIS
IS EVEN OUT OF
YOUR LEAGUE.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.333
Principal Peskin:
CHESTER, COME HERE.

01:14.166 --> 01:16.333
DO YOU KNOW
THAT DOG,
MR. McPHEE?

01:16.333 --> 01:17.250
NO.

02:10.375 --> 02:12.750
P.A.: WILL THE FOLLOWING
STUDENTS PLEASE REPORT

02:12.750 --> 02:17.166
TO PRINCIPAL PESKIN'S
OFFICE IMMEDIATELY:

02:17.166 --> 02:21.166
JACK McPHEE,
ZACK ESTRIN,

02:21.166 --> 02:27.834
DAWSON LEERY,
DAVE BUSSAN,
PACEY WITTER.

02:28.458 --> 02:29.375
PROCESS OF ELIMINATION

02:29.375 --> 02:32.750
HAS MADE YOU ONE
OF THE LUCKY 3

02:32.750 --> 02:35.583
THAT I STILL CONSIDER TO BE
A SUSPECT IN THIS CRIME.

02:35.583 --> 02:36.959
NOW ,THERE'S AN EASY WAY
TO DO THIS, MR. WITTER,

02:36.959 --> 02:39.834
AND THERE IS
A HARD WAY.

02:39.834 --> 02:42.333
WELL, SEEING AS I
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

02:42.333 --> 02:43.959
WHAT CRIME
YOU'RE REFERRING TO,

02:43.959 --> 02:45.250
I'LL PROBABLY TAKE
THE EASY WAY.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.166
WHAT, ARE YOU GUYS
ACCUSING ME
OF SOMETHING?

02:49.166 --> 02:50.625
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE
THE LAST PERSON

02:50.625 --> 02:53.000
I WOULD SUSPECT
OF BEING RESPONSIBLE
FOR A STUNT LIKE THIS,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.333
BUT YOU CAN ALSO UNDERSTAND
WHY WE WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE

02:55.333 --> 02:56.208
BUT TO BRING YOU IN.

02:56.208 --> 02:59.333
[LAUGHS] YEAH.
THE DOG FINGERED ME.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.542
Mitch: WE'RE
ON YOUR SIDE, PACEY,

03:00.542 --> 03:02.375
BUT WE GOT TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM
OF THIS MYSTERY.

03:02.375 --> 03:05.208
AND CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE
THAT WE AT LEAST

03:05.208 --> 03:07.208
CONSIDER YOU
AS A POSSIBLE SUSPECT.

03:07.208 --> 03:08.250
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES
WOULD THOSE BE?

03:08.250 --> 03:11.375
WELL, GIVEN
THAT YOU'RE MY SON,

03:11.375 --> 03:13.959
IT, UH, FOLLOWS THAT
YOU WOULD HAVE ACCESS

03:13.959 --> 03:16.083
TO MY MASTER KEYS
TO THE SCHOOL,

03:16.083 --> 03:17.333
THEREBY PLACING YOU
ON A RATHER SHORT LIST.

03:17.333 --> 03:20.250
MR. WITTER, EVERYONE
IN CAPESIDE IS AWARE

03:20.250 --> 03:23.458
OF THE RATHER SAD FATE
OF THE LATE VESSEL
TRUE LOVE,

03:23.458 --> 03:24.667
WHICH, I BELIEVE,
GAVE YOU ACCESS

03:24.667 --> 03:27.500
TO THE MARINE
STORAGE FACILITY
IN THE YACHT CLUB

03:27.500 --> 03:31.208
WHERE MY BOAT
RESIDED AT THE TIME
OF ITS BOATNAPPING,

03:31.208 --> 03:32.542
IF YOU WILL.

03:32.542 --> 03:35.500
CHESTER WAS TAKEN
SOMETIME BETWEEN
10:00 IN THE MORNING,

03:35.500 --> 03:38.583
WHEN MRS. PESKIN
LET HIM OUT
AFTER BREAKFAST,

03:38.583 --> 03:41.750
AND NOON,
WHEN SHE REALIZED
HE WAS GONE.

03:41.750 --> 03:45.250
SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TELL US
WHERE YOU WERE

03:45.250 --> 03:48.500
AND WHO YOU WERE WITH
YESTERDAY MORNING.

03:51.625 --> 03:57.000
JEN! JEN, COME ON.
JEN! OPEN THE DOOR.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.583
OH. OH.
I'M STILL ASLEEP.

04:00.583 --> 04:01.542
AND THIS IS
A DREAM

04:01.542 --> 04:02.959
IN WHICH YOU'RE
HETEROSEXUAL.

04:02.959 --> 04:05.291
YEAH. THESE ARE FOR GRAMS.

04:05.291 --> 04:07.959
CAN YOU OPEN
THE DOOR, PLEASE?

04:07.959 --> 04:09.583
I GOT SOMETHING
WAY BETTER FOR YOU.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.291
REALLY?
YES.

04:12.291 --> 04:14.750
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
BE BETTER THAN
A DAPPER, YOUNG LAD

04:14.750 --> 04:16.083
BEARING A FLORAL
ARRANGEMENT?

04:16.083 --> 04:17.834
I TALKED TO
THE GUIDANCE OFFICE.

04:17.834 --> 04:21.250
YOU KNOW THAT COMMUNITY SERVICE,
MANUAL-LABOR THING YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING?

04:21.250 --> 04:22.375
OH, YEAH.
I ASKED THEM
IF IT WAS POSSIBLE

04:22.375 --> 04:24.542
IF YOU COULD FULFILL
YOUR COMMITMENT

04:24.542 --> 04:26.333
BY ASSISTING ME
WITH MY SOCCER TEAM.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.583
AND WHAT'D THEY SAY?

04:27.583 --> 04:31.250
THEY SAID,
"PROVIDING THAT KIND
OF GUIDANCE FOR A KID

04:31.250 --> 04:33.500
"IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF
REHABILITATING ACTIVITY

04:33.500 --> 04:37.750
THAT YOUR KIND NEEDS
IN ORDER TO MEND HER EVIL WAYS."

04:38.583 --> 04:40.333
JACK, I THINK
I'M MORE QUALIFIED

04:40.333 --> 04:41.917
TO PICK UP TRASH
ON THE HIGHWAY

04:41.917 --> 04:43.125
THAN MOLD
IMPRESSIONABLE
YOUNG MINDS.

04:43.125 --> 04:44.667
AW, COME ON.
LOOK, I NEED YOU HERE.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.583
EVERY SINCE ANDIE LEFT,
I'VE BEEN BARELY GETTING BY.

04:47.583 --> 04:49.917
I MEAN, THE SOCCER PARENTS
HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY UNHELPFUL.

04:49.917 --> 04:52.959
AND IF THAT WEREN'T ENOUGH,
MY STAR GOALIE BROKE HIS LEG
YESTERDAY

04:52.959 --> 04:55.000
TRYING TO JUMP OFF
THE ROOF OF HIS HOUSE
INTO HIS SWIMMING POOL.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.083
OK. ALL RIGHT.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.834
YOU'VE
SUFFICIENTLY PLUCKED
MY HEARTSTRINGS.

04:58.834 --> 04:59.834
I'LL DO IT.

04:59.834 --> 05:01.542
YOU'RE A GODDESS.

05:01.542 --> 05:03.000
GIVE THESE TO GRAMS
WHEN SHE GETS BACK
FROM CHURCH.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.458
OK.

05:04.458 --> 05:07.125
HEY, I'LL BE BACK
AT 12:45 SHARP
TO PICK YOU UP.

05:07.125 --> 05:08.375
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

05:08.375 --> 05:09.792
I--I CAN
MAKE EGGS.
UM--

05:09.792 --> 05:12.458
I GOT TO, UH,
I GOT TO MEET DRUE

05:12.458 --> 05:13.708
AT THE HARDWARE STORE.

05:13.708 --> 05:15.667
WHY ARE YOU MEETING DRUE
AT THE HARDWARE STORE?

05:15.667 --> 05:17.250
LONG STORY.
IT'S A KARMA THING.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.333
HEY, I GOTTA RUN.

05:19.333 --> 05:23.708
YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T
PULL THIS STUNT.

05:23.708 --> 05:26.959
FINE. CONVINCE ME.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.625
TELL ME EVERYTHING,

05:28.625 --> 05:34.583
EVERY SINGLE THING
YOU DID YESTERDAY.

05:36.959 --> 05:40.583
YESTERDAY.

05:40.583 --> 05:42.458
NOW, LET'S SEE.
WHERE WAS I?

05:44.250 --> 05:46.834
WHERE WAS I?

05:46.834 --> 05:50.417
OH, YES. RIGHT HERE.

05:52.834 --> 05:55.125
HEY, PACE.
MM-HMM?

05:55.125 --> 05:58.083
YOU ARE A PUSHOVER.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.542
YOU GAVE IN.

05:59.542 --> 06:01.625
NO, I AM NOT
A PUSHOVER.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.875
I JUST FELT
THE NEED TO EXPLORE
MY OPTIONS.

06:03.875 --> 06:05.875
PACEY, FOR 5 YEARS,
YOUR BROTHER
HAS BEEN NAGGING YOU

06:05.875 --> 06:09.959
ABOUT SPENDING A DAY
WITH HIM OBSERVING
POLICE POLICIES,

06:09.959 --> 06:12.000
AND YOU'VE
ALWAYS TOLD HIM
TO JUST STICK IT.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.834
THEN YOU TAKE
SOME MEANINGLESS
CAREER APTITUDE TEST,

06:14.834 --> 06:17.375
AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE
WATCHING THE LOST EPISODES
OF COP ROCK

06:17.375 --> 06:19.166
AND TAKING HIM UP
ON HIS DUBIOUS OFFER.

06:19.166 --> 06:21.542
WELL, DON'T YOU
THINK I'D LOOK SEXY
IN A UNIFORM?

06:21.542 --> 06:23.542
HMM?

06:23.542 --> 06:24.834
BESIDE THE POINT.

06:24.834 --> 06:25.542
OH, I DON'T
THINK SO AT ALL.

06:31.041 --> 06:33.291
WELL, KISS ME GOOD-BYE

06:33.291 --> 06:35.667
BEFORE I HIT
THE ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE
ASPHALT JUNGLE.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.583
I'LL PRAY FOR YOU,
SWEETHEART.

06:42.583 --> 06:43.208
[SIGHS]

06:43.208 --> 06:45.834
HI, DOUG.
HEY.

06:45.834 --> 06:47.875
TAKE CARE OF THIS PUNK
FOR ME, WILL YA?

06:47.875 --> 06:48.708
SEE IF MAYBE YOU CAN'T
STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT
A LITTLE BIT?

06:48.708 --> 06:50.667
STRAIGHT ISN'T
A REALLY BIG PART

06:50.667 --> 06:52.166
OF DOUG'S
VOCABULARY,
YOU KNOW.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.750
YEAH, THAT'S FUNNY.
HURRY UP.
WE GOTTA GET GOING.

06:59.583 --> 07:01.875
WHY ARE YOU STARING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

07:01.875 --> 07:03.417
WHEN I GOT UP
YESTERDAY MORNING,

07:03.417 --> 07:04.542
YOU WEREN'T
AT THE HOUSE.

07:04.542 --> 07:07.083
WHICH PROVES THAT
I KIDNAPPED CHESTER?

07:07.083 --> 07:09.083
AREN'T YOU GUYS
WORKING THIS WHOLE,

07:09.083 --> 07:10.875
LIKE, NYPD BLUE  ANGLE
A LITTLE HARD?

07:12.375 --> 07:14.250
ALL RIGHT, UM,
IN THE MORNING,

07:14.250 --> 07:15.708
MOM GAVE ME A RIDE.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.875
Gale: NOW, LISTEN,
GET HOME AS QUICKLY
AS POSSIBLE.

07:18.875 --> 07:20.542
I NEED YOU
TO FIND THE KEYS
TO YOUR DAD'S CAR,

07:20.542 --> 07:21.708
WHICH I KNOW YOU LOST.

07:21.708 --> 07:22.458
NO, I HAD THEM.
I HAD THEM HERE LAST NIGHT.

07:22.458 --> 07:24.333
AFTER I WENT
TO THE MOVIES

07:24.333 --> 07:26.792
AND BEFORE I WENT OUT,
I TOOK THEM WITH ME.

07:26.792 --> 07:28.417
I THINK.

07:28.417 --> 07:30.917
WHATEVER.
JUST FIND 'EM BEFORE
HE KNOWS THEY'RE GONE.

07:36.625 --> 07:37.667
BYE.

07:37.667 --> 07:38.875
HAVE FUN.

07:47.458 --> 07:49.625
YOU SUMMONED ME.

07:49.625 --> 07:51.542
I HAVE A STUDY
WHERE I KEEP MY ARCHIVES,
ALL MY PAPERS.

07:51.542 --> 07:55.083
NEEDS TO BE CLEANED OUT,
SORTED THROUGH.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.000
OK, BUT YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO PAY ME.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.792
EXCUSE ME?

07:58.792 --> 07:59.959
I FULFILLED
MY DEBT TO YOU.

07:59.959 --> 08:01.000
I PAINTED YOUR HOUSE.
I PAINTED YOUR FENCE.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.291
YOUR BOAT IS FIXED.
WE'RE EVEN. IT'S OVER.

08:04.291 --> 08:05.375
SO, I'LL DO THIS,
BUT I'M GONNA NEED
SOME COMPENSATION.

08:05.375 --> 08:08.208
NO.
ALL RIGHT.

08:10.333 --> 08:12.417
I'LL PAY YOU
WHAT YOU'RE WORTH.

08:13.959 --> 08:16.208
VERY LITTLE.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.792
Jack: I WAS DOING
A PROJECT FOR CHEM
WITH DRUE VALENTINE.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.250
YOU KNOW HIM. WE HAD TO GO
TO THE HARDWARE STORE

08:22.250 --> 08:24.708
TO PICK UP SOME SUPPLIES.

08:24.708 --> 08:26.250
Drue:
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW TOUCHED I AM

08:26.250 --> 08:27.000
BY THE WAY YOU'VE
REACHED OUT TO ME
LATELY, JACK.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.708
SO MOVING.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.500
TO BE HONEST,
I FELT SURE YOU HELD ME

08:31.500 --> 08:32.500
AT LEAST SOMEWHAT
RESPONSIBLE

08:32.500 --> 08:34.500
FOR THAT WHOLE MESS
WITH YOUR SISTER.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.833
HUH, WHATEVER.
HEY, YOU WANNA GO
GRAB THAT PAINT?

08:37.833 --> 08:40.000
WHAT PAINT?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.291
THE PAINT. YOU KNOW,
FOR THE PROJECT
THAT WE'RE DOING.

08:41.291 --> 08:43.667
COME BACK TO ME, DRUE.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.417
LOOK, ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS GO GET THE PAINT

08:45.417 --> 08:48.667
AND, UM, AND TAKE THIS UP
TO THE REGISTER FOR ME.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.458
WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT?

08:50.458 --> 08:52.959
UH, ONE OF THE SOCCER GOALS
ON THE FIELD'S FALLING APART.

08:52.959 --> 08:57.000
I GOTTA GET SOME NET,
AND IF I DON'T FIX IT,
NOBODY ELSE WILL.

08:58.375 --> 08:59.083
MUST BE WEIRD.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.792
WHAT?

09:01.792 --> 09:03.125
BEING SELFLESS.

09:05.834 --> 09:07.667
Principal Peskin:
WHERE DID YOU GO
WITH DEPUTY WITTER?

09:07.667 --> 09:10.208
YOU MEAN MY BROTHER?

09:10.208 --> 09:10.875
WHERE DO YOU THINK?

09:16.041 --> 09:18.041
I'M SHAKIN' MY HEAD
IN DISBELIEF.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.542
DON'T JUDGE A BOOK
BY ITS PROLOGUE,
WISE-ASS.

09:20.542 --> 09:22.542
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
COMING UP FAST,

09:22.542 --> 09:23.250
MORE THAN ANY
EPISODE OF COPS
COULD TEACH YOU,

09:23.250 --> 09:24.208
BELIEVE YOU ME.

09:24.208 --> 09:27.708
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

09:27.708 --> 09:29.667
WELL, LEMME
BRACE MYSELF FOR THAT.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.375
Dawson: AND THAT'S IT.
I SPENT THE REST
OF THE MORNING

09:34.375 --> 09:35.959
ALONE IN THE STUDY.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.667
[DOOR HINGES SQUEAK]

10:11.041 --> 10:13.041
"ARTHUR ISAAC BROOKS.

10:13.041 --> 10:14.875
"NEWSPAPER. TRACK AND FIELD.

10:14.875 --> 10:19.333
ASPIRATION TO BECOME
A GREAT HOLLYWOOD FILMMAKER."

10:19.333 --> 10:21.208
OH, MY GOD.

10:21.208 --> 10:24.000
DAWSON, I THINK
IT'S TIME WE DISCUSSED

10:24.000 --> 10:26.417
YOUR INFAMOUS
NINTH-GRADE SENIOR PACT
FOR A MINUTE.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.667
DAD, THAT WAS 4 YEARS AGO.

10:28.667 --> 10:31.041
WAIT, WHAT PACT?

10:31.041 --> 10:32.166
WHEN I WAS IN NINTH GRADE,

10:32.166 --> 10:37.208
UM, THE SENIORS PULLED
A PARTICULARLY LAME PRANK.

10:37.208 --> 10:38.250
I THINK THEY GRAFFITIED
THE LOCKERS

10:38.250 --> 10:39.542
AND TRASHED THE PARKING LOT
OR SOMETHING.

10:39.542 --> 10:40.417
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.

10:40.417 --> 10:43.000
AND, UH, PACEY AND I
MADE A PACT

10:43.000 --> 10:44.417
THAT WHEN OUR TIME CAME,
WE WOULD DO IT RIGHT--

10:44.417 --> 10:47.125
THE PRANK TO END ALL PRANKS.

10:47.125 --> 10:47.625
WE TALKED ABOUT IT
FOR YEARS.

10:47.625 --> 10:49.375
SO IT WAS YOU!

10:49.375 --> 10:51.792
NO, IT WASN'T ME.
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

10:51.792 --> 10:55.500
PACEY AND I AREN'T EXACTLY
BUTCH AND SUNDANCE THESE DAYS.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.458
I DIDN'T REMEMBER
THE PACT UNTIL YOU SA--

10:59.542 --> 11:02.667
WELL? WHAT IS IT?

11:02.667 --> 11:05.417
I CAN TELL YOU
I DIDN'T DO IT.

11:05.417 --> 11:08.750
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR PACEY.

11:21.041 --> 11:24.667
SO, YOU PICKED UP JEN
AT 12:45.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.834
MM-HMM. I THINK SO.
DID I SAY THAT?

11:26.834 --> 11:29.959
WHAT TIME DID YOU GET
TO THE PARK?

11:29.959 --> 11:33.792
UM, I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS, LIKE,
1:35-ISH.

11:35.959 --> 11:36.750
WOULD YOU GET YOUR FOOT
OFF THE NET?!

11:36.750 --> 11:39.583
PUT YOUR LITTLE
DOOHICKEY--

11:39.583 --> 11:41.000
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.166
ALL RIGHT,
PIECE OF CAKE.

11:42.166 --> 11:43.375
ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA
TAKE CARE OF SOMETHING.

11:43.375 --> 11:47.458
MOLLY! DOUBLE TIME.
OVER HERE.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.208
[CHUCKLES]
JEEZ.

11:50.208 --> 11:50.959
Jen: I'M JUST FINE.

11:53.417 --> 11:54.333
WHAT'D I DO?

11:54.333 --> 11:56.458
NOTHING, NOTHING.
RELAX. DEFLATE.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.625
WHAT DO
YOU WANT?

11:57.625 --> 11:59.208
WELL, I'VE GOT
SOME GOOD NEWS.

11:59.208 --> 12:02.208
AFTER A CAREFUL REVIEW
OF ALL THE PLAYERS
ON THE TEAM,

12:02.208 --> 12:03.375
I HAVE DECIDED
TO OFFER YOU

12:03.375 --> 12:06.542
THE POSITION OF GOALIE
LEFT VACANT BY KIP'S INJURY.

12:06.542 --> 12:09.417
OFFERING? LIKE,
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT?

12:09.417 --> 12:13.208
YEAH. WELL, IT'S, UH,
I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

12:13.208 --> 12:16.708
IN THAT CASE,
THANK YOU,
BUT NO, THANK YOU.

12:16.708 --> 12:18.834
W-W-WHOA.
NO, THANK YOU? WHA--

12:18.834 --> 12:20.250
I'D REALLY RATHER NOT.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.583
YEAH, BUT GOALIE IS--IS--

12:22.583 --> 12:24.125
I'M LEFT HALFBACK.

12:24.125 --> 12:25.792
I LIKE
LEFT HALFBACK.

12:25.792 --> 12:28.208
I'D LIKE TO STICK
WITH LEFT HALFBACK,
OK? PLEASE?

12:28.208 --> 12:30.625
OK.

12:34.834 --> 12:37.291
I LIKE THAT KID.
FUNNY.

12:37.291 --> 12:40.083
YOU KNOW, SHE REMINDS ME
OF ME AT THAT AGE.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.458
NO, SHE KNOWS IF I
PUT HER IN GOAL,

12:41.458 --> 12:43.166
BOYS ARE GONNA
TORTURE HER
OUT OF SPITE.

12:43.166 --> 12:45.417
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
KIDS LIKE MOLLY AND MYSELF

12:45.417 --> 12:46.959
TEND TOWARDS
THE EASIER ALTERNATIVE,

12:46.959 --> 12:49.041
THE ONE
WITH THE LEAST OPPORTUNITY

12:49.041 --> 12:50.667
FOR EMBARRASSMENT
RATHER THAN GLORY.

12:50.667 --> 12:53.667
YEAH.
UNLESS, OF COURSE...

12:53.667 --> 12:55.291
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
WHAT?

12:55.291 --> 12:57.000
YOU GET US
REALLY PISSED OFF.

12:57.959 --> 12:59.625
NOW, LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE,
SHALL WE?

12:59.625 --> 13:04.417
MY BOAT WAS QUIETLY REMOVED
FROM THE STORAGE WAREHOUSE
BEHIND THE YACHT CLUB

13:04.417 --> 13:07.250
SOMETIME BETWEEN 12:30 P.M.
AND 5:15.

13:07.250 --> 13:10.417
RECORDS INDICATE THAT
YOU ARE THE ONLY SENIOR

13:10.417 --> 13:13.458
WHO HAD ACCESS
TO THAT PARTICULAR WAREHOUSE.

13:13.458 --> 13:15.333
AND JUST WHAT RECORDS
MIGHT THOSE BE?

13:15.333 --> 13:18.917
I'LL BE ASKING THE QUESTIONS,
MR. WITTER.

13:18.917 --> 13:21.959
OK. ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TALK.

13:21.959 --> 13:23.667
BUT I GOTTA WARN YOU,

13:23.667 --> 13:25.125
IT'S GONNA BE
DEATHLY BORING.

13:31.583 --> 13:34.333
DOUG?
YEAH?

13:34.333 --> 13:37.291
DO YOU EVER FIND YOURSELF
SITTIN' OUT HERE

13:37.291 --> 13:40.125
AT THE EDGE OF THE HIGHWAY
IN YOUR SQUAD CAR,

13:40.125 --> 13:43.667
YOU GOT YOUR RADAR GUN
IN HAND,

13:43.667 --> 13:47.041
BEEN OUT HERE FOR 4 HOURS
IN WHICH ONLY 3 CARS
HAVE PASSED,

13:47.041 --> 13:48.834
ALL GOING
UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT,

13:48.834 --> 13:51.458
AND WONDER JUST WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO YOUR LIFE?

13:51.458 --> 13:54.125
PARDON ME?

13:54.125 --> 13:55.375
WELL, SERIOUSLY, MAN.
LOOK AT YOU.

13:55.375 --> 13:56.834
FOR ALL
YOUR ELLIOT NESS DREAMS

13:56.834 --> 13:59.208
AND HARRY CALLAHAN ASPIRATIONS,
YOU'RE NOTHING.

13:59.208 --> 14:01.458
I MEAN, NOBODY. AT BEST,
YOU'RE THE BARNEY FIFE OF
THIS LITTLE PODUNK TOWN.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.458
WHAT'S THAT?

14:06.667 --> 14:08.750
DOES THIS DIATRIBE
HAVE A POINT, PACEY?

14:13.875 --> 14:16.333
I--NO. NO, NOT REALLY.

14:16.333 --> 14:20.166
I'M JUST A LITTLE
DISCONCERTED BY IT ALL.

14:26.542 --> 14:29.166
Principal Peskin:
SO, AT 12:00, YOU WERE STILL
AT THE ARTHUR BROOKS ESTATE?

14:29.166 --> 14:30.417
Dawson: YES, I WAS.

14:30.417 --> 14:33.125
BY 12:30, I WAS
MORE THAN READY
TO GET OUT OF THERE.

14:33.125 --> 14:34.125
[CAR HORN HONKS]

14:42.959 --> 14:44.000
Mr. Brooks:
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.166
OH, UH, HOME.
I'M DONE FOR THE DAY.

14:46.166 --> 14:47.708
THE HELL YOU ARE.

14:47.708 --> 14:49.583
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
TAKE MY MONEY

14:49.583 --> 14:51.375
AND WANDER OFF
TO SPOON WITH
YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

14:51.375 --> 14:52.417
YOU'RE SADLY
MISTAKEN.

14:52.417 --> 14:53.708
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

14:53.708 --> 14:55.375
IF YOU'RE
NOT BACK HERE
WITHIN 3 HOURS,

14:55.375 --> 14:57.291
YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT BEING PAID.

15:04.792 --> 15:06.208
YOUR MOM WAS STUCK
AT THE RESTAURANT.

15:06.208 --> 15:07.291
SHE ASKED ME TO GET YOU.

15:07.291 --> 15:08.375
OH, SO I'M A FAVOR.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.125
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
[CHUCKLES]

15:10.834 --> 15:12.333
SO, WHAT WAS
THAT ABOUT?

15:12.333 --> 15:15.417
OH, IT'S ABOUT WHAT
A COMPLETE AND TOTAL JERK
HE INSISTS ON BEING.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.375
JEN'S INSIGHT
INTO THE 10-YEAR-OLD
PSYCHE SEEMED VALID.

15:20.375 --> 15:21.583
AND EVEN THOUGH PRACTICE
WAS ENDING

15:21.583 --> 15:24.583
AND THE KIDS HAD
2 HOURS OF FREEDOM
BEFORE THE GAME,

15:24.583 --> 15:28.083
I STILL WASN'T READY
TO GIVE UP ON MOLLY
PLAYING GOALIE.

15:30.333 --> 15:32.750
MOLLY. MOLLY, COME HERE.

15:38.708 --> 15:39.875
YOU GET ANY ORANGE WEDGES?

15:39.875 --> 15:42.583
ONE. BILLY TOOK
THE OTHER ONE

15:42.583 --> 15:44.458
AND SMASHED IT
INTO THE GROUND.

15:44.458 --> 15:45.458
YEAH, BILLY'S A JERK.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.750
JUST WAIT UNTIL
I'M 17 AND HOT.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.750
HE'LL REGRET
MESSING WITH ME.

15:49.750 --> 15:52.458
LOOK, MOLLY,
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU'RE 17 OR YOU'RE 45.

15:52.458 --> 15:56.375
THESE GUYS AREN'T
GONNA RESPECT YOU
UNLESS YOU MAKE THEM.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.667
HOW DO I MAKE THEM
RESPECT ME?

15:58.667 --> 16:02.083
LOOK, MOLLY, YOU GOTTA
PROVE IT TO YOURSELF.

16:02.083 --> 16:04.708
OK? IF YOU DO THAT,
IF YOU BELIEVE

16:04.708 --> 16:06.083
THAT YOU'RE JUST
AS GOOD AS THEY ARE,

16:06.083 --> 16:09.333
I GUARANTEE YOU
THE REST IS JUST GONNA
TAKE CARE OF ITSELF.

16:09.333 --> 16:12.000
YOU FIND A GOALIE YET?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.708
NAH.

16:13.708 --> 16:16.250
CAN I STILL HAVE IT?

16:16.250 --> 16:17.375
YEP.

16:17.375 --> 16:19.250
FINE. BRING IT ON.

16:21.708 --> 16:24.166
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST
TOTALLY PULLED
A FAST ONE ON ME.

16:24.166 --> 16:27.333
BUT I'M GONNA
LET IT GO BECAUSE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.875
BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

16:29.875 --> 16:32.375
EXACTLY WHAT
YOU JUST DID.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.166
JUST BRING IT.

16:45.583 --> 16:50.500
WHENEVER I SEE THAT GUY,
I CAN'T HELP BUT HEARING
THE DARTH VADER THEME.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.834
HA HA HA.
I'M MAKING AN EFFORT.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.625
NOT TO BE CRUEL,
BUT WHY?

16:54.625 --> 16:56.125
KIND OF A KARMIC DECISION.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.000
THANK YOU FOR THE RIDE.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.500
JUST DOING YOUR MOM
A FAVOR.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.750
HA HA. RIGHT.

17:05.916 --> 17:08.208
WELL, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

17:08.208 --> 17:09.333
THE DEVIL APPEARS.

17:09.333 --> 17:14.834
SO, DRUE, WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO MY HUMBLE ABODE?

17:14.834 --> 17:18.125
FIRST I JUST WANTED TO EXTEND
MY GRATITUDE FOR LAST NIGHT.

17:18.125 --> 17:19.583
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW...

17:19.583 --> 17:21.541
WE MET AT THE MOVIE THEATER.
COMMON DECENCY DICTATES

17:21.541 --> 17:23.625
I LEND YOU 5 BUCKS
FOR POPCORN AND ASK YOU
TO SIT WITH ME.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.040
THE BURGER AFTERWARDS
WAS YOUR IDEA.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.583
SMALL TO YOU,
BUT SIGNIFICANT TO ME.

17:26.583 --> 17:29.834
I'M JUST GRATEFUL TO FINALLY
FIND AT LEAST ONE ALLY

17:29.834 --> 17:30.917
IN THIS STRANGE
AND ECLECTIC HAMLET.

17:30.917 --> 17:33.542
YOU MAY BE MY FIRST.

17:33.542 --> 17:36.708
WELL...HEH.

17:36.708 --> 17:38.166
I APPRECIATE
THE THOUGHT,

17:38.166 --> 17:39.500
BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO COME ALL THE WAY
DOWN HERE

17:39.500 --> 17:40.417
JUST TO TELL ME THAT.

17:40.417 --> 17:41.875
RIGHT.
THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.708
YOU LEFT THESE
IN MY CAR, MAN.

17:43.708 --> 17:47.333
AH. THANK YOU.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.333
THANK--I--
YOU JUST SAVED ME FROM,

17:49.333 --> 17:50.959
LIKE, A SOLID HOUR
OF PATERNAL LECTURING.

17:50.959 --> 17:52.959
IT WAS THE LEAST I COULD DO.

17:52.959 --> 17:53.834
AND AS I SAID, YOU KNOW,

17:53.834 --> 17:55.834
YOU REACHED OUT
TO THE NEW KID.

17:55.834 --> 17:56.875
WHAT GOES AROUND
COMES AROUND.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.708
THAT IS SO TRUE.

17:58.708 --> 18:01.166
WOULD I BE OUT OF LINE
IF I ASKED
WHAT WE'RE DOING?

18:01.166 --> 18:03.375
SOMEBODY STOLE A DOG.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.333
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT DIDN'T JUST GET LOST?

18:05.333 --> 18:06.583
WE DON'T.

18:06.583 --> 18:09.083
THE OWNER FOUND
SOME FOOTPRINTS
IN THE DIRT.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.375
IT MIGHT BE
THE GARDENER,

18:10.375 --> 18:11.291
BUT EITHER WAY,
WE HAVE TO FIND
THIS DOG

18:11.291 --> 18:14.208
BECAUSE IT IS
A VERY IMPORTANT DOG.

18:14.208 --> 18:15.166
SO, WAIT, HOLD ON.
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

18:15.166 --> 18:18.417
IS THIS WHAT YOU MEANT
WHEN YOU TOLD ME

18:18.417 --> 18:19.917
THAT I'D LEARN MORE
FROM WATCHING YOU

18:19.917 --> 18:21.667
THAN FROM ANY EPISODE
OF COPS?

18:23.625 --> 18:25.166
WH--OH, COME ON.
DON'T TELL ME

18:25.166 --> 18:26.583
YOU'RE STILL ANGRY
AT YOUR LITTLE BROTHER

18:26.583 --> 18:29.041
FOR THAT WHOLE
"WASTING YOUR LIFE"
SHTICK.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.125
I ONLY SORT OF
MEANT IT.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.667
HONEST.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.792
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN
TO ME VERY CLOSELY

18:37.792 --> 18:40.750
BECAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA
SAY THIS ONE TIME.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.542
IF YOU EVER IN YOUR LIFE
CARE ABOUT ANYTHING
AS MUCH AS I CARE

18:42.542 --> 18:46.250
ABOUT BEING AN OFFICER
IN THIS TOWN,
I WILL BE SHOCKED.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.917
IF YOU EVER IN YOUR LIFE
ARE AS GOOD AT ANYTHING

18:49.917 --> 18:53.166
AS I AM AT BEING
AN OFFICER IN THIS TOWN,
I WILL BE SHOCKED.

18:53.166 --> 18:58.333
IF YOU EVER IN YOUR LIFE
PRESUME TO JUDGE ME AGAIN,

18:58.333 --> 19:02.625
SO HELP ME GOD,
I WILL BEAT THE UGLY
RIGHT OUT OF YOU.

19:07.291 --> 19:11.417
SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
IS THAT YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR THE VERY SAME DOG

19:11.417 --> 19:13.792
THAT YOU'RE SUSPECTED
OF HAVING TAKEN?

19:13.792 --> 19:17.792
MITCH, YOU ARE A SANE
AND REASONABLE MAN,

19:17.792 --> 19:22.917
AND IT IS OBVIOUS
THAT I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS WHOLE FIASCO,

19:22.917 --> 19:24.375
SO WHY ARE WE STILL HERE?

19:24.375 --> 19:27.375
WE'RE STILL HERE BECAUSE
A CERTAIN FRESH DETAIL
HAS COME TO LIGHT

19:27.375 --> 19:31.166
WHICH SUGGESTS THAT WE
MUST, AT THE LEAST,

19:31.166 --> 19:33.917
ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF YOUR
WHEREABOUTS YESTERDAY.

19:38.375 --> 19:41.792
YOU DISCUSSED
MY NINTH-GRADE PACT
WITH DAWSON.

19:41.792 --> 19:44.208
OH, YOU REMEMBER
THE AGREEMENT, TOO,
I SEE.

19:44.208 --> 19:47.083
WELL, OF COURSE I REMEMBER IT.
IT WAS MY IDEA.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.458
BUT DID IT OVER OCCUR TO YOU

19:48.458 --> 19:52.291
THAT MY NOT-SO-CLOSE
ACQUAINTANCE-SLASH-
FORMER BEST FRIEND

19:52.291 --> 19:55.667
HAS HINTED OR POSSIBLY EVEN
IMPLICATED YOURS TRULY

19:55.667 --> 19:57.041
ONLY TO DIVERT SUSPICION
FROM HIMSELF?

19:57.041 --> 19:59.583
MR. WITTER,
JUSTICE IS BLIND.

19:59.583 --> 20:02.333
IF DAWSON IS RESPONSIBLE,
WE'LL NAIL HIM...

20:03.500 --> 20:04.375
JUST AS WE'LL NAIL YOU.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.959
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
WE'RE STILL DOING THIS?

20:16.959 --> 20:19.208
I'LL TELL YOU HOW.

20:19.208 --> 20:23.041
CAPESIDE HIGH, A FACILITY
TO WHICH YOU HAVE HAD
INTIMATE ACCESS,

20:23.041 --> 20:26.125
MUST'VE BEEN TRESPASSED UPON
SOMETIME AFTER 5:30 P.M.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.542
WHEN THE CLEANING CREW
WENT HOME.

20:28.542 --> 20:30.041
THERE WERE NO SIGNS
OF FORCED ENTRY,

20:30.041 --> 20:33.542
WHICH IMPLIES AN INSIDE JOB.

20:33.542 --> 20:36.583
DAD, I WAS HOME
LAST NIGHT.
YOU SAW ME.

20:36.583 --> 20:42.208
AT 10:00. UH, JUST TELL US
ABOUT THE PRIOR 5 HOURS--

20:42.208 --> 20:44.333
AFTERNOON AND EVENING,
WHERE YOU WERE,
WHO YOU WERE WITH--

20:44.333 --> 20:47.125
AND I PROMISE YOU
WE'LL BE DONE WITH THIS.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.875
WE'LL BE DONE WITH THIS
WHEN I'VE GOT MY MAN.

20:56.458 --> 21:00.625
WELL, WELL, WELL,
I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU HERE.

21:00.625 --> 21:04.125
UH, YOU SHOULDN'T.
I WORK HERE.

21:04.125 --> 21:05.750
I DON'T THINK SO.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.583
I THOUGHT WE HAD
AN AGREEMENT.

21:08.583 --> 21:10.625
WE DID. YOU BROKE IT.
YOU'RE FIRED.

21:10.625 --> 21:11.792
ON WHAT GROUNDS?

21:11.792 --> 21:14.041
YOU WERE PLAYING FOOTSIE
WITH YOUR FLOOZY

21:14.041 --> 21:15.542
WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING A JOB.

21:15.542 --> 21:19.500
I GUESS I FORGOT
YOU'RE JUST
A HORMONAL ADOLESCENT.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.708
WHAT DO YOU
POSSIBLY HOPE TO GAIN
BY INSULTING MY FRIEND?

21:21.708 --> 21:23.500
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT YOU OR YOUR LADY,

21:23.500 --> 21:26.041
BUT I DO CARE ABOUT
HAVING MY GENEROSITY
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

21:26.041 --> 21:29.708
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE YOU
ARE ALONE AND YOUR LIFE
IS FULL OF ABANDONED DREAMS

21:29.708 --> 21:33.792
DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE LICENSE
TO INFLICT YOUR PAIN ON ME.

21:33.792 --> 21:37.291
HOW DARE YOU PRESUME
TO UNDERSTAND ME--

21:37.291 --> 21:39.458
WHO I AM,
WHERE I'VE BEEN,
WHAT I'VE DONE?

21:41.000 --> 21:44.625
NOW GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

21:44.625 --> 21:45.917
FINE.

21:53.250 --> 21:54.708
WELL, YOU CAN GO.

21:54.708 --> 21:55.917
I CAN?

21:55.917 --> 21:57.959
MM-HMM.

21:57.959 --> 21:59.375
JUST AS SOON AS YOU TELL US
WHERE YOU WERE

21:59.375 --> 22:02.166
BETWEEN 5:30 LAST NIGHT
AND 8:00 THIS MORNING.

22:02.166 --> 22:04.875
LET'S JUST STICK TO
LAST NIGHT AFTER 5:30.

22:05.917 --> 22:08.875
ONCE AGAIN, AS I'VE
ALREADY TOLD YOU,

22:08.875 --> 22:12.250
WE HAD A GAME.
IT WAS OUR FIRST
PLAYOFF GAME.

22:12.250 --> 22:15.583
[SIPS AND GULPS]

22:17.708 --> 22:18.917
HEY, JACKERS.

22:18.917 --> 22:20.000

22:20.000 --> 22:21.708
MILITANT PEEWEE PARENTS
AT 2 O'CLOCK.

22:26.667 --> 22:27.667
JACK.

22:27.667 --> 22:28.625
GUS.

22:30.417 --> 22:33.291
WE'RE HEARING
A STRANGE RUMOR
FROM OUR KIDS

22:33.291 --> 22:35.834
THAT YOU'RE GONNA
PUT THE--

22:35.834 --> 22:38.834
PUT THAT LITTLE GIRL IN
FOR KIP AS GOALIE.

22:38.834 --> 22:41.375
YEAH. IT'S NOT A RUMOR.
THAT'S A FACT.

22:41.375 --> 22:44.333
YEAH, WELL, I'M AFRAID
WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT.

22:45.291 --> 22:46.333
THAT'S OK. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ALLOW IT.

22:46.333 --> 22:48.834
I'M THE COACH.
IT'S MY CALL.

22:48.834 --> 22:54.750
JACK, I REPRESENT,
UH, PARENTS WHO KEPT
THEIR MOUTHS SHUT

22:54.750 --> 22:57.959
WHEN CERTAIN ALARMING
PERSONAL DETAILS
CAME TO LIGHT.

22:57.959 --> 23:00.792
BUT, HEY,
THIS IS NOT PERSONAL.

23:00.792 --> 23:02.750
THIS IS SOCCER.

23:02.750 --> 23:04.417
SO LET ME GIVE IT TO YOU
REAL STRAIGHT, JACK.

23:04.417 --> 23:07.500
YOU PUT THE LITTLE GIRL
IN FOR GOALIE,
WE'LL LOSE THE GAME.

23:07.500 --> 23:11.500
WE LOSE THE GAME,
YOU LOSE YOUR JOB.

23:13.792 --> 23:16.041
OK. YEAH. I'LL TAKE THAT
UNDER ADVISEMENT.

23:16.041 --> 23:18.625
GUS, IF YOU FELLAS DON'T MIND,
I'D LIKE TO WARM UP MY TEAM.

23:20.375 --> 23:22.208
YEAH. GOOD.

23:22.208 --> 23:23.417
THANKS.

23:28.625 --> 23:30.875
OOH. LOOKS LIKE
PAT BUCHANAN'S POSSE.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.166
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THIS.
WHAT?

23:32.166 --> 23:35.000
THEY SAID THEY'RE GONNA FIRE ME
IF I KEEP MOLLY ON GOAL.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.041
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

23:36.041 --> 23:37.583
JACK, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

23:39.834 --> 23:41.458
W-WAIT A SECOND.

23:42.166 --> 23:43.667
YOU COULDN'T FIND THE DOG,

23:43.667 --> 23:45.959
SO YOUR BROTHER MADE YOU
GET IN THE BACK OF THE CAR?

23:45.959 --> 23:47.333
I'M CONFUSED.

23:47.333 --> 23:48.875
I WAS CONFUSED, TOO.

23:48.875 --> 23:51.083
IT SEEMED
SO BLATANTLY HOSTILE,
EVEN FOR DOUGIE.

23:51.083 --> 23:55.041
FRANKLY, WHEN HE WENT IN,
I CONSIDERED
MAKING A BREAK FOR IT.

24:04.041 --> 24:05.375
OK.

24:17.041 --> 24:19.542
ALL RIGHT.

24:19.542 --> 24:23.000
WELL, MIKE, THE GUY
IN THE BACK'S NOT A PERP.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.417
HE'S MY LITTLE BROTHER.

24:24.417 --> 24:25.792
HOW GOES IT, JUNIOR WITTER?

24:28.583 --> 24:29.792
IT'S BEEN BETTER.

25:13.333 --> 25:14.000
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
UH...

25:16.000 --> 25:18.333
NO REASON.

25:24.917 --> 25:26.834
AN HOUR LATER,
AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT,

25:26.834 --> 25:28.458
I WAS BACK
AT THE BROOKS HOUSE.

25:34.542 --> 25:37.417
TODAY, WHEN I WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR THINGS, I FOUND
YOUR HIGH-SCHOOL YEARBOOK.

25:37.417 --> 25:41.959
UNDERNEATH THE PICTURE,
THE CAPTION SAID THAT
YOUR LIFE'S AMBITION

25:41.959 --> 25:44.333
WAS TO BECOME
A HOLLYWOOD FILMMAKER.

25:44.333 --> 25:46.333
UH, A PRETTY STRIKING
COINCIDENCE,

25:46.333 --> 25:50.417
GIVEN THAT I'VE HAD
THE EXACT SAME DREAM FOR
AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER.

25:50.417 --> 25:51.917
GOOD FOR YOU.

25:51.917 --> 25:54.000
IT SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF ME.

25:55.208 --> 25:57.000
'CAUSE I DON'T EVER
WANT TO BE LIKE YOU.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.750
I DON'T EVER WANT TO BE
THE KIND OF PERSON

25:59.750 --> 26:02.917
WHO PUSHES EVERYTHING
AND EVERYONE AWAY FROM HIM.

26:02.917 --> 26:04.166
I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE.

26:04.166 --> 26:07.083
AND I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE ALONE, EITHER.

26:07.083 --> 26:10.667
YOU CAN'T GET RID OF ME,
MR. BROOKS.

26:10.667 --> 26:12.208
WHAT YOU SAY AND DO
TO EVERYONE ELSE,

26:12.208 --> 26:14.708
IT MIGHT WORK ON THEM,
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA WORK ON ME.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.917
SO I'M BACK.

26:16.917 --> 26:19.333
AND I'M GONNA FINISH THE JOB
THAT I WAS HIRED TO DO.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.750
BEFORE I COULD EVEN REALIZE
WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

26:30.750 --> 26:32.000
IT WAS OVER.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.375
SOMEHOW WE'D WON THE GAME.

26:41.792 --> 26:44.000
HEY! WHOO!

26:45.000 --> 26:47.375
NICE GAME, GUYS.

26:47.375 --> 26:50.041
YEAH, NICE GAME.
GOOD GAME.

26:50.041 --> 26:51.083
CONGRATULATIONS,
FELLAS.

26:51.083 --> 26:52.583

PLAYED GREAT.

26:52.583 --> 26:54.667

26:54.667 --> 26:56.208
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT SOCCER?

26:56.208 --> 26:58.667
YEAH.

26:58.667 --> 27:00.041
MY TEAM'S
JUST WON THE FIRST
PLAYOFF GAME.

27:00.041 --> 27:01.708
I'D LIKE TO THINK
I KNOW SOMETHING.
SURE.

27:01.708 --> 27:03.708
WELL, MAYBE YOU KNOW
THAT WHEN A PLAYOFF GAME
IS TIED,

27:03.708 --> 27:05.333
AS OUR NEXT GAME
COULD BE,

27:05.333 --> 27:08.250
A GOAL SCORED AGAINST US
IN PREVIOUS GAMES REFLECT
ON THE EVENTUAL TALLY.

27:08.250 --> 27:09.667
EXCUSE ME.

27:09.667 --> 27:11.333
IF WE TIE THE FALCONS
ON WEDNESDAY,

27:11.333 --> 27:14.917
THEN THE 3 GOALS THAT
LITTLE GIRL LET SLIP BY
WILL COUNT AGAINST US.

27:17.834 --> 27:19.875
WELL, THEN I'LL JUST
HAVE TO WIN THAT GAME

27:19.875 --> 27:22.000
AGAINST THE FALCONS
ON WEDNESDAY.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.959
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE MISTAKEN.
YOU SEE,

27:23.959 --> 27:27.375
YOU CAN'T BEAT THE FALCONS
ON WEDNESDAY, 'CAUSE YOU'RE NO
LONGER THE COACH OF THIS TEAM.

27:30.792 --> 27:32.333
YOU'RE DONE, McPHEE.

27:36.125 --> 27:37.333

27:42.125 --> 27:44.166
THEY DIDN'T.

YEP.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.583
YEAH, THEY JUST DID.

27:56.834 --> 27:59.875
IT WAS A LITTLE AFTER 9:00
WHEN WE GOT THE CALL,

27:59.875 --> 28:03.375
AND DOUG AND I HEADED OUT
TO THE BOAT YARD.

28:12.667 --> 28:14.375

WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE

28:38.959 --> 28:42.375
SKULKING THROUGH THE SHADOWS
AT THIS HOUR OF NIGHT?

28:42.375 --> 28:43.458
ANONYMOUS PHONE CALL.

28:43.458 --> 28:44.792

28:44.792 --> 28:46.291
NOW, WHY WOULD
SOMEONE CALL YOU?

28:46.291 --> 28:47.750
WELL, THEY DIDN'T,
TECHNICALLY.

28:47.750 --> 28:50.250
THEY CALLED MY MOTHER,
AND THIS FALLS UNDER
HER JURISDICTION,

28:50.250 --> 28:51.708
SO SHE SENT ME OUT HERE
TO CHECK IT OUT.

28:51.708 --> 28:56.667
I CALLED THE POLICE,
WHICH IS WHY YOU ARE
HERE NOW, DEPUTY WITTER.

28:56.667 --> 28:57.917
EXCEPT WHAT YOU COULDN'T
POSSIBLY KNOW

28:57.917 --> 29:00.834
WAS THAT WE ALSO RECEIVED
AN ANONYMOUS PHONE CALL

29:00.834 --> 29:03.875
ROUGHLY 20 MINUTES
BEFORE YOUR CALL,
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION,

29:03.875 --> 29:05.708
HOW DO I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T TAKE THE BOAT?

29:05.708 --> 29:08.458
DO YOU SEE A BOAT
ON ME, MAN?

29:08.458 --> 29:09.583
I MEAN, YOU CAN FRISK ME
IF YOU WANT.

29:09.583 --> 29:11.792
I BET YOU'D LIKE THAT.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.834
COME ON, LET'S DO
THE MAN DANCE.

29:16.333 --> 29:21.333
WELL, OK.
WELL, THEN I GUESS
I'M DONE, AREN'T I?

29:23.208 --> 29:25.834
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I'M GONNA GO,
TOO, DOUGIE.

29:25.834 --> 29:27.291
HEY, PACEY,
I CAN'T DRIVE YOU HOME
NOW, ALL RIGHT?

29:27.291 --> 29:28.458
THIS IS OFFICIAL
POLICE BUSINESS.

29:28.458 --> 29:29.708
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GET A RIDE WITH DRUE.

29:29.708 --> 29:30.875
HEY, DRUE, HOLD ON A SECOND.

29:30.875 --> 29:33.583
HEY, NEWS FLASH, PACEY.
YOU HATE DRUE.

29:33.583 --> 29:36.208
YES, I DO, BUT IT'S
ONLY A RIDE HOME.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.333
AND I'M TRYING TO BE
A BETTER PERSON,
JUST LIKE YOU.

29:38.333 --> 29:39.375
BESIDES, IT'S A KARMA THING.

29:39.375 --> 29:42.542
YEAH. GOOD-BYE.

29:49.750 --> 29:50.917
AND THAT WAS IT.

29:50.917 --> 29:51.583
THEN I LEFT WITH DRUE.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.708
AND WHERE DID YOU GO?

29:53.708 --> 29:55.959
WELL, I WANTED TO
GRAB A BITE TO EAT.

29:55.959 --> 29:59.000
HE SAID HE WAS BUSY.
HE DROPPED ME OFF
AT HOME.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.625
WITHIN 25 MINUTES,
I WAS SLEEPING
LIKE A BABY.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.333
ALL RIGHT, PACEY.

30:04.333 --> 30:06.667
YOU CAN GO.

30:06.667 --> 30:08.500
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.792
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

30:10.792 --> 30:12.792
SERIOUSLY?
YOU'RE NOT JUST
MESSING WITH ME?

30:12.792 --> 30:15.458
GET OUT OF HERE, PACE,
BEFORE HE CHANGES HIS MIND.

30:19.667 --> 30:21.667
SOMETHING ELSE, MR. WITTER?

30:21.667 --> 30:24.208
WELL, YEAH,
I WAS JUST THINKING,

30:24.208 --> 30:27.917
HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK
DAWSON DID IT, EITHER.

30:27.917 --> 30:29.125
WHY'S THAT?

30:29.125 --> 30:30.000
THAT GUY'S
WAY TOO RESPECTABLE

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
TO PULL OFF
THAT TYPE OF CRIME.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.291
AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT
MY COAXING, YOU KNOW?

30:34.291 --> 30:35.333
JUST NOT THAT TYPE
OF GUY.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.333
PACEY MIGHT BE COCKY,
BUT HE'S NOT AN IDIOT.

30:38.333 --> 30:40.458
I MEAN, THERE'S NO WAY

30:40.458 --> 30:42.417
HE WOULD JEOPARDIZE
HIS ACADEMIC FOOTHOLD

30:42.417 --> 30:44.625
FOR WHAT WAS HARDLY
THE PRANK TO END ALL PRANKS.

30:45.834 --> 30:47.166
OK. THANKS.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.583
WELL, DAVE. SATISFIED?

30:56.583 --> 30:57.792
YES, MITCHELL, I AM.

30:57.792 --> 30:59.291
I'M VERY SATISFIED,
INDEED,

30:59.291 --> 31:01.792
CONSIDERING THAT
I KNOW WHO DID IT.

31:03.125 --> 31:04.125
REALLY?

31:04.125 --> 31:06.083
OBVIOUSLY.

31:06.083 --> 31:09.583
WELL, IT'S CLEAR YOU DON'T
WATCH INSPECTOR POIROT ON A&E.

31:16.917 --> 31:17.917
Mrs. Valentine:
THERE IS NEITHER
RHYME NOR REASON

31:17.917 --> 31:19.041
THAT COULD ACCOUNT
FOR YOUR ACCUSATION

31:19.041 --> 31:22.792
THAT MY SON WAS A PARTY
TO THIS PRACTICAL JOKE.

31:22.792 --> 31:25.542
YOU GENTLEMEN SHOULD
BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

31:25.542 --> 31:26.125
ALL RIGHT,
MRS. VALENTINE.

31:26.125 --> 31:27.917
IF YOU'RE FINISHED,

31:27.917 --> 31:30.417
I'D LIKE
TO EXPLAIN TO YOU
EXACTLY HOW WE KNOW

31:30.417 --> 31:32.792

WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS DEBACLE.

OF WHITE PAINT IDENTICAL
TO THE KIND THAT WAS USED

31:45.125 --> 31:50.708
TO SCRAWL THE WORDS

AT THE LEERY RESIDENCE
RETURNING MITCH'S KEYS,

31:54.667 --> 31:56.834
KEYS THAT COULD HAVE
EASILY HAVE BEEN COPIED

ONE FINAL APPEARANCE,

AT THE STORAGE WAREHOUSE
BEHIND THE YACHT CLUB,

CONVENIENTLY PRESENT AT ALL
THE NECESSARY MOMENTS,

32:16.250 --> 32:20.625
HE ACQUIRED THE MEANS
AND RESOURCES TO DO THE JOB,

32:20.625 --> 32:23.667
AND HE HAD THE TIME
TO PULL IT ALL OFF...

32:23.667 --> 32:27.500
WITHOUT A HITCH.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.625

ONE THING I'VE LEARNED

32:43.667 --> 32:45.291
DURING MY CAREER
AS AN EDUCATOR

32:45.291 --> 32:48.417
IS THAT, UH, CHILDREN
ARE FICKLE CREATURES.

32:48.417 --> 32:51.834
DOES A WEEK OF SUSPENSION
SOUND LIKE A FAIR PUNISHMENT
TO YOU?

32:51.834 --> 32:53.875
NO. TRY 2 WEEKS

32:53.875 --> 32:55.458
AND, UH, PROBATION
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

TO BE QUITE TELLING.

OK, I THINK WE'RE
THROUGH HERE.

33:03.708 --> 33:05.291
OH!

MY PURSE.

COME HERE.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.291
WHAT'S GOING ON?

33:24.291 --> 33:26.667
SEND A MESSAGE
TO THE BOYS FOR ME.

33:26.667 --> 33:29.667
TELL THEM THAT I ADMIRE
THE BRILLIANCE
OF THEIR DESIGN.

33:30.917 --> 33:34.166
NO, WAIT. JUST TELL 'EM

CAUGHT UP WITH ME.

33:56.708 --> 33:59.542
LOOK, I--UH, I JUST
WANTED TO COME BY
AND SAY THANKS

33:59.542 --> 34:02.417
FOR LETTING ME DO
THAT WHOLE RIDE-ALONG
THING YESTERDAY.

34:02.417 --> 34:03.792
IT WAS ILLUMINATING.

34:03.792 --> 34:06.708
HAVE YOU EVER SAID
ANYTHING THAT WASN'T
LINED WITH SARCASM?

34:06.708 --> 34:08.708
I'M ADMITTING
I WAS WRONG, DOUG.

34:08.708 --> 34:12.166
WHAT YOU DO,
IT MATTERS AS MUCH
IF NOT MORE

34:12.166 --> 34:13.833
THAN ANY JOB
I'LL EVER BE ABLE
TO HOLD DOWN.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.166
WELL, THAT'S INTERESTING,
CONSIDERING YESTERDAY,

34:16.166 --> 34:17.333
YOU DIDN'T THINK
IT MATTERED AT ALL.

34:17.333 --> 34:19.250
WELL, NOW I THINK
IT MATTERS.

34:19.250 --> 34:21.875
I MEAN, I KNOW IT
MATTERS TO MIKE.

34:21.875 --> 34:24.208
I KNOW IT MATTERS
TO SOME DUMB KID
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP

34:24.208 --> 34:25.875
FROM KILLING
ALL HIS FRIENDS
IN A CAR WRECK

34:25.875 --> 34:27.083
WHEN YOU PULL HIM
OVER FOR SPEEDING

34:27.083 --> 34:28.208
AND SCARE THE CRAP
OUT OF HIM.

34:28.208 --> 34:31.000
AND I'M GUESSING
THAT IT PROBABLY
MATTERS

34:31.000 --> 34:32.708
IN A MILLION OTHER
SUBTLE WAYS THAT I,

34:32.708 --> 34:35.208
WITH THE SUBTLETY
OF AN ELEPHANT
IN AN ANTIQUE SHOP,

34:35.208 --> 34:36.583
WILL NEVER,
EVER NOTICE.

YEAH, WELL, IF IT
WASN'T ME DOING THE JOB,

34:39.708 --> 34:41.125
IT'D JUST BE
SOMEBODY ELSE.

34:41.125 --> 34:43.875
BUT IT IS YOU, DOUG.

34:43.875 --> 34:48.583
IT'S YOU, AND I
WOULDN'T BE SO QUICK
TO DISMISS THAT.

34:48.583 --> 34:50.750
I MEAN, TO BE
PERFECTLY HONEST,
I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY

34:50.750 --> 34:53.166
TO SOMEDAY

WITH YOU.

34:53.166 --> 34:58.458

BE A MISTAKE.

THINK I'D MAKE
MUCH OF A COP, HUH?

THAT YOU'RE
A DARING ORIGINAL.

HAVE A TALENT

35:10.458 --> 35:12.917
FOR FLYING IN THE FACE
OF CONVENTIONALITY,

35:12.917 --> 35:14.417

THAT YOU WERE BORN

35:14.417 --> 35:15.792

NOT ENFORCE THEM.

THAT IN YOU.

35:20.583 --> 35:23.792
I REALLY DO.

WHAT?

35:27.792 --> 35:31.834
DID MY BIG BROTHER DOUG
JUST ADMIT THAT HE ADMIRED ME

35:31.834 --> 35:34.166
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER?

35:34.166 --> 35:36.708

MORE LIKE I'M

OF HAVING TO SIT

STOPPED MORE GOALS,

WITH WHO I AM
AS A COACH,

37:51.375 --> 37:54.834
NOT YOU AS A PLAYER.

THEY KNEW I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT YOU.

37:56.083 --> 37:58.375
THEY JUST COULDN'T
ADMIT IT.

37:58.375 --> 38:00.583
AND YOU KNEW IT, TOO,
DIDN'T YOU? HMM?

CAROLINE SAID IT
WASN'T MY FAULT,

BELIEVE HER, BECAUSE...

HERE, GUYS?

39:22.166 --> 39:22.959

WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
DOING THIS ALONE.

SWUNG BY THE PESKINS'

39:48.917 --> 39:52.041
SOMETIME AFTER HE
MET UP WITH DRUE
AT THE HARDWARE STORE.

39:52.041 --> 39:55.875
HE WOULD HAVE HAD TIME
TO LEAVE THE PAINT HE
"ACCIDENTLY" TOOK HOME

SOMETIME AFTER 1:30, WHEN
DRUE DROPPED OFF THE KEYS,

40:04.834 --> 40:07.500
AND BEFORE 3:30,
WHEN I HAD TO GET BACK
TO MR. BROOKS' HOUSE.

40:07.500 --> 40:10.625
PACEY WOULD HAVE
GIVEN ME THE CODE...

40:10.625 --> 40:13.000

THE MITCH MOBILE
TO TOW THE TRUCK BACK

I THEN WOULD HAVE
LEFT THE BOAT AND CAR
WITH CHESTER AND THE PAINT.

LATER ON, PACEY COULD HAVE
ASKED DRUE TO DROP HIM OFF

40:24.250 --> 40:26.333

NEAR THE RENDEZVOUS POINT.

40:28.458 --> 40:31.083

AT THE LOCATION,

ONLY A HYPOTHETICAL.
