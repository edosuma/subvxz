00:44.708 --> 00:49.625
<i>Many generations ago, Spirits
lived amongst Human kind,</i>

00:50.875 --> 00:53.708
<i>protecting them from the
dangers of the world.</i>

00:54.875 --> 00:58.417
<i>Two of these Spirits,
Shen Tu and Yu Lei,</i>

00:58.625 --> 01:00.708
<i>were sworn to defend any home</i>

01:00.833 --> 01:03.958
<i>that hung special posters
on its front doors.</i>

01:04.292 --> 01:05.292
Help!

01:07.500 --> 01:11.101
<i>They're known as the
Guardian Brothers.</i>

01:11.125 --> 01:12.125
Hiyaa!

01:15.292 --> 01:18.208
<i>The trouble is, the
world has changed.</i>

01:18.333 --> 01:20.875
<i>Humans learned to live
without the Spirits,</i>

01:21.000 --> 01:23.542
<i>and eventually,
forgot they existed.</i>

01:23.875 --> 01:25.458
<i>They stopped hanging posters,</i>

01:25.583 --> 01:29.500
<i>and now the Spirit realm is in
a constant state of disorder.</i>

01:39.667 --> 01:46.292
<i>♪ I don't need no spotlight ♪</i>

01:47.000 --> 01:51.625
<i>♪ 'Cause mine comes
from the inside ♪</i>

01:51.750 --> 01:54.292
<i>♪ Out from the inside out ♪</i>

01:55.208 --> 01:57.625
<i>♪ Illuminate the skies ♪</i>

01:57.792 --> 01:59.958
<i>♪ Come alive ♪</i>

02:00.167 --> 02:03.167
<i>♪ There's no tomorrow tonight ♪</i>

02:03.292 --> 02:07.125
<i>♪ Can't hold me down
I'm ready now ♪</i>

02:07.250 --> 02:10.958
<i>♪ I'm gonna glow ♪</i>

02:11.083 --> 02:14.833
<i>♪ I'm gonna glow, glow, glow ♪</i>

02:14.958 --> 02:16.333
<i>♪ I'm gonna glow... ♪</i>

02:16.500 --> 02:20.875
<i>But there are some places that
keep the old traditions alive.</i>

02:22.167 --> 02:24.875
<i>Like this soup shop in
the heart of the city.</i>

02:28.208 --> 02:29.458
Rain, careful.

02:34.542 --> 02:35.917
- Mom.
- Come on, Mom.

02:36.042 --> 02:38.542
- Can we cross now?
- Go ahead.

02:43.042 --> 02:45.726
- Rain!
- Hi, Grandma!

02:45.750 --> 02:47.500
It's always so good
to see you both.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.667
Come inside where it's warm.

02:52.292 --> 02:54.833
Still believing in Guardian
Spirits, huh, Mom?

02:54.958 --> 02:58.875
These Spirits have watched
over the shop for generations.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.375
Well, clearly haven't
visited in a while.

03:01.542 --> 03:05.333
Oh, Luli, I know you think
it's all make-believe.

03:05.458 --> 03:09.833
Rain, have I ever told you how
my grandma once met the Spirits?

03:09.958 --> 03:12.250
No way. What were they like?

03:12.583 --> 03:14.958
Later. First, let Grandma
take care of you.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.000
Have some of my famous soup.

03:17.125 --> 03:20.583
It's been a long time since
you've had some, hasn't it, Rain?

03:20.708 --> 03:22.292
Far too long.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.625
Too long, but it
still smells like...

03:28.792 --> 03:29.917
Home.

03:36.833 --> 03:37.833
Hope you liked it.

03:42.667 --> 03:43.917
- Here's your soup.
- Ah!

03:44.292 --> 03:47.667
- Thanks, Luli.
- You're in that old soup shop again? Ugh!

03:48.167 --> 03:50.375
They've had that
same menu for ever.

03:51.292 --> 03:52.833
We can go somewhere else, Dad.

03:55.125 --> 03:57.542
Rain, look at this great
backpack Grandma got you.

03:57.667 --> 03:58.934
I love it.

03:58.958 --> 04:00.458
That's so cool, Mom.

04:09.208 --> 04:13.875
<i>When Grandma passed away, her
family followed the old customs.</i>

04:14.500 --> 04:17.458
<i>Even though the rest of
the world had changed,</i>

04:18.458 --> 04:20.208
<i>Grandma may have died,</i>

04:20.666 --> 04:24.875
<i>but now, Rain and Luli must
keep her memory alive.</i>

04:31.125 --> 04:32.833
Are we gonna be OK, Mom?

04:34.542 --> 04:37.268
It's gonna be hard to run
the shop without Grandma.

04:37.292 --> 04:38.976
I need you to be a
big girl, Rain.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Maybe the Spirits will help us.

04:42.292 --> 04:45.708
<i>Other people float lanterns
into the sky for fun,</i>

04:45.875 --> 04:49.250
<i>but Rain and Luli know a secret
Grandma used to tell them.</i>

04:49.708 --> 04:54.375
<i>These lanterns float to the spirit
world, high above the clouds.</i>

05:00.167 --> 05:04.458
<i>The lanterns get tangled in the
branches of the ancient Spirit Tree,</i>

05:04.792 --> 05:08.208
<i>which has grown on the mountain
for thousands of years.</i>

05:08.708 --> 05:12.500
<i>No one knows why, but this
tree is watched over by,</i>

05:13.000 --> 05:15.875
<i>you guessed it, the
Guardian Brothers.</i>

05:17.250 --> 05:21.167
<i>This is SNN. The
Spirit News Network.</i>

05:21.292 --> 05:23.292
<i>I'm your host, Chet Spiritman.</i>

05:23.583 --> 05:26.958
<i>Today's top story, or should
I say our only story,</i>

05:27.125 --> 05:31.250
<i>the Guardian Spirit strike
rages on with no end in sight.</i>

05:31.417 --> 05:33.958
<i>The Humans have stopped
believing in us.</i>

05:34.250 --> 05:35.143
<i>After exploring...</i>

05:35.167 --> 05:37.434
- After all we've done for them.
<i>- The farthest reaches of the world.</i>

05:37.458 --> 05:39.375
<i>Belief in magic and
ancient spirits</i>

05:39.500 --> 05:42.300
<i>- has become the subject of ridicule...</i>
- That's the stuff right there.

05:42.458 --> 05:44.333
<i>- Woah! What about us, huh?</i>
- Perfect.

05:44.458 --> 05:46.476
<i>- What about your Guardians?</i>
- Shen Tu!

05:46.500 --> 05:48.458
<i>- We used to look after you sharks!</i>
- What?

05:50.375 --> 05:52.792
Shen Tu, look. Look at
all these lanterns.

05:52.917 --> 05:56.292
- The Humans must be asking us for help.
- Don't kid yourself, Yu Lei.

05:56.667 --> 05:59.375
Nobody has asked us for
help in a long time.

06:00.792 --> 06:01.792
Huh?

06:03.458 --> 06:04.625
How do you explain that?

06:05.917 --> 06:09.042
I knew it, Shen Tu. Someone's
trying to send us a message.

06:10.542 --> 06:11.542
Yu Lei, no!

06:12.917 --> 06:15.750
- Get off!
- No, Yu Lei. You know the rules, bro.

06:16.458 --> 06:18.018
Get off!

06:18.042 --> 06:20.750
That's man-made. You know
you can't trust the Humans.

06:20.875 --> 06:23.833
- But someone needs our help.
- The Humans don't like us anymore.

06:23.958 --> 06:25.838
For all we know, that's
some kind of booby trap.

06:26.125 --> 06:28.268
The Guardians used to go to
the Human world all the time.

06:28.292 --> 06:29.809
Times have changed.

06:29.833 --> 06:30.934
Don't you understand?

06:30.958 --> 06:32.184
- It's against the law.
- Yu Lei...

06:32.208 --> 06:34.750
- He's right.
- Hey, Beckett. What's new?

06:34.875 --> 06:38.125
Humans have moved on. Most
don't even know we exist.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.750
Those that do are old and
aren't taken seriously.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.750
But this strike is preposterous.

06:43.125 --> 06:46.042
We should be in the Human world
helping as many people as possible.

06:46.208 --> 06:48.768
That's how we get
them to remember us.

06:48.792 --> 06:52.250
If we keep this up, it won't be
long before all traces of us

06:52.375 --> 06:54.417
disappear from the
world forever.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.042
While we sit on our
hands doing nothing.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.750
- Yu Lei, wait.
- Brother...

07:00.167 --> 07:02.833
- We're guardians, not gardeners.
- Oh, grow up!

07:02.958 --> 07:05.667
So things aren't as exciting
as they used to be.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.184
But we'll find
something else to do.

07:07.208 --> 07:09.125
We used to make a
difference to Humans.

07:09.625 --> 07:12.226
How can you be so happy
doing nothing all day?

07:15.042 --> 07:16.875
Oh, no, it's Dean. Get
it together, Yu Lei.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.625
- Nice landing, boss.
- Deputies, announce me.

07:21.750 --> 07:24.083
Presenting Dean, the
Mayor's assistant.

07:24.208 --> 07:26.583
And the mighty babies!

07:27.000 --> 07:28.750
Hey, big guy, front and center.

07:28.958 --> 07:30.125
Hey, Dean.

07:30.292 --> 07:33.000
It's so good to see you.
Things are fine here.

07:33.125 --> 07:36.208
Music box floated up. It's
right over there in the tree.

07:36.417 --> 07:38.042
What? A music box?

07:38.167 --> 07:39.768
- Did you touch it?
- I bet he touched it.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.912
- Oh, he touched it.
- No, definitely didn't touch it.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.333
No. No touch it.

07:43.708 --> 07:45.351
So, Dean, what are
you doing here?

07:45.375 --> 07:47.083
Anything you can
do for the cause?

07:47.750 --> 07:48.792
- Letter.
- Here you go.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.417
Here. Right from the Mayor.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.708
Whoa. Uh, did we do
something wrong?

07:54.208 --> 07:57.083
Well, not yet. Or maybe you did.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.917
- Fellas, megaphone, please.
- You got it, boss.

08:00.042 --> 08:01.792
- "Dear, Spirit citizens."
- Listen up.

08:01.917 --> 08:05.083
"As you know, our way of life
as Guardians is under attack.

08:05.208 --> 08:08.542
For too long, we have served Humans
without thinking of ourselves.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.542
Are we going to stand for this?

08:10.708 --> 08:13.518
- No, no, no. No.
- <i>Gesundheit</i>, boss.

08:13.542 --> 08:16.083
Remember why we are on strike.
We are Spirits united.

08:16.208 --> 08:18.667
The Humans may be forgetting us,

08:18.792 --> 08:20.809
- but we can't forget each other."
- He means you guys.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.583
So we're gathering in 15 minutes

08:22.708 --> 08:24.628
for a public forum with
the Mayor at Spirit Hall.

08:24.750 --> 08:25.768
Tardiness will be punished.

08:25.792 --> 08:26.768
- And don't be late.
- Fifteen minutes?

08:26.792 --> 08:27.667
That's right.

08:27.792 --> 08:29.500
If the Mayor says jump,
you better jump.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.250
And you don't ask why. <i>Capisce?</i>

08:31.375 --> 08:32.375
You behave.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.832
Now, where was I?

08:34.125 --> 08:35.167
Most importantly,

08:35.417 --> 08:38.542
what to do with the remaining
Guardian posters in the Human world.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.893
They are the portals between
the Human and Spirit worlds,

08:40.917 --> 08:42.143
- and should not be used.
- What?

08:42.167 --> 08:43.308
- How many of their posters
- Hold on.

08:43.332 --> 08:44.413
Are hanging in the village?

08:45.625 --> 08:47.208
One thousand?

08:47.375 --> 08:50.208
One hundred? Only one? What?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.333
That's pathetic.

08:52.958 --> 08:54.278
- That's embarrassing.
- Just one?

08:54.542 --> 08:56.476
My mom has more pictures
of me on her fridge.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.708
Now let's wrap this up.

08:57.917 --> 09:01.125
- Funny, boss.
- You, Shen Tu and you, Yu Lei...

09:01.667 --> 09:03.917
Huh? Beckett!

09:04.083 --> 09:06.375
- What are you doing here?
- Spill it, old timer.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.851
I was in the neighborhood and thought
I'd stop by and see the boys.

09:08.875 --> 09:09.958
Oh, velvet.

09:10.208 --> 09:12.583
- Good. That will save me some time.
- Good. Mmm.

09:12.958 --> 09:15.542
Listen up. To make sure you
aren't using those posters,

09:15.667 --> 09:17.750
yours truly will be supervising
your nightly curfew.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.250
Expect me at midnight.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.167
- He said midnight.
- That is all.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.542
Nice hat, Beckett.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.250
We're done here.

09:24.583 --> 09:26.500
Next stop, Spirit Hall!

09:26.792 --> 09:28.958
- Up, up and away!
- Woah!

09:30.500 --> 09:34.500
Please keep your hands, feet and wings
inside the Tuk Tuk at all times.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.750
Hey, anyone know
any sing-alongs?

09:38.167 --> 09:42.083
<i>♪ 99 bottles of clay on the
wall 99 bottles of clay... ♪</i>

09:45.375 --> 09:47.583
Quiet down, deputies, you're
distracting the driver.

09:47.708 --> 09:48.958
- Sorry, boss.
- Whale!

10:02.292 --> 10:03.625
That was the whale, I swear.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.792
Liar. Check your pants.

10:05.958 --> 10:07.833
Hey, boss. Put on
the party playlist.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.476
Turn it up, this is my jam.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.375
<i>♪ You've got soul ♪</i>

10:18.667 --> 10:19.667

10:36.208 --> 10:37.583

10:39.208 --> 10:40.708
Another great landing, boss.

10:41.042 --> 10:43.167
- All right, get out.
- Hey, where were we?

10:43.583 --> 10:44.875
Oh, my.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.059
That Uber is only
getting one star.

10:48.917 --> 10:50.083
Taxi!

10:51.083 --> 10:52.875
Coming through. Yeah!

10:55.042 --> 10:56.500
Oh, my toes, Shen Tu!

10:56.625 --> 10:58.393
- Excuse me, Spirit.
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

10:58.417 --> 11:00.726
<i>- </i> Sorry about that.
<i>- Put your hands together for the Mayor!</i>

11:00.750 --> 11:02.958
What's up, Spirits?

11:03.292 --> 11:05.667
So, who here wants
to end the strike?

11:05.792 --> 11:07.708
- I want to end the strike.
- Nobody?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.458
Then we're all on the same page.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.958
Thank you all for
accepting my invitation.

11:14.125 --> 11:18.143
We're at a key moment in this revolution.
We've done so much since the strike began,

11:18.167 --> 11:21.625
Humans are no longer using
us as their doormats. Ha!

11:22.208 --> 11:24.833
Effective immediately, I'm
starting a systematic removal

11:24.958 --> 11:27.250
of all Guardian portals
in the Spirit world.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.875
So let's celebrate
our independence.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.101
Now where my dogs at?

11:31.125 --> 11:32.833
There they are. Hit it, boys.

11:35.583 --> 11:38.792
Now show me your spirit.

11:38.917 --> 11:41.958
That's why I had you learn this
choreographed dance routine.

11:44.792 --> 11:47.375
Now show me what you got.
Shake those flippers.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.500

11:51.000 --> 11:53.167

11:53.292 --> 11:55.875
Straight legs. Go, go, go.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.417
Everyone, together.

11:58.208 --> 12:00.958
Yu Lei, I didn't expect
to see you here.

12:01.917 --> 12:03.542
Well, yeah, that
makes two of us.

12:03.667 --> 12:06.208
Don't know how to dance?
I'll show you how.

12:07.333 --> 12:10.292
- Uh, hey, Colossus, hey!
- So...

12:10.458 --> 12:12.042
It's been a while, old friend.

12:12.625 --> 12:13.625
Hey, help.

12:14.375 --> 12:16.375
Huh? Yu Lei!

12:18.042 --> 12:19.958
- Bro grip!
- Hey, Colossus!

12:20.083 --> 12:21.958
- Can't breathe.
- What's up, man?

12:22.125 --> 12:23.667
So what are you guys been up to?

12:23.792 --> 12:27.583
I got a top secret job in the Human world.
I guess I shouldn't have told you that.

12:28.792 --> 12:30.917
Nice job, people.
Needs more work.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.250
But you're trying.

12:32.458 --> 12:33.750
Now for some bad news.

12:33.917 --> 12:36.458
One of us has broken the rules
by going to the Human world.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.083
My assistant Dean reports

12:38.208 --> 12:41.167
that he saw this Spirit using a
portal after helping a Human.

12:41.667 --> 12:44.708
This criminal goes
by the name of...

12:46.333 --> 12:47.625
Beckett!

12:47.833 --> 12:50.250
<i>- Moi?
- Oui, toi.</i>

12:51.125 --> 12:54.292
You just had to be the hero
when a old lady fell down.

12:54.833 --> 12:57.667
- And she couldn't get up, am I right?
- Well, you got me.

12:57.792 --> 13:01.292
But how could you expect us to leave
behind everything we've ever known?

13:02.583 --> 13:05.708
Oh, Beckett. This
is what I mean.

13:05.917 --> 13:09.167
What can I say? You'll never
be willing to change yourself.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.417
- So, you're banished.
- What?

13:12.667 --> 13:14.750
- You're banishing me?
- That's right.

13:15.167 --> 13:17.500
- You are gone!
- Woah!

13:17.667 --> 13:19.458
Now hand over your
Guardian robes.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.333
What? My what?

13:21.625 --> 13:23.625
These are my clothes,
not a uniform.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.351
What do you expect me to do?

13:25.375 --> 13:27.208
What if I'm not
wearing underwear?

13:27.667 --> 13:29.000
That's gross.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.292
Well, he's all yours, boys.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.917
Let me go!

13:34.417 --> 13:35.417
No!

13:35.625 --> 13:37.167
- How embarrassing.
- What!

13:39.625 --> 13:44.250
Ha! So, is everyone
sufficiently motivated?

13:44.417 --> 13:47.375
Then that will be all for today.
Later, darlings.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.083
No spirit has ever
been banished before.

13:56.042 --> 13:57.542
Look at the poor guy.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.042
Nobody deserves this.

13:59.792 --> 14:01.851
I feel for him, but
rules are rules.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.292
He knew what he was doing.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.125
Yeah, he was helping people.

14:05.250 --> 14:08.208
I have been a Guardian
Spirit for so long.

14:08.375 --> 14:12.750
I had hoped... that I'd be
helping Humans forever.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.667
I guess the Mayor was right.

14:15.792 --> 14:18.000
Times have changed,
but I haven't.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.583
I thought I could wait it out,

14:19.708 --> 14:22.417
but I just couldn't see people
in need and do nothing.

14:23.250 --> 14:25.167
I was just being stubborn.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.542
I guess I don't have a place...

14:28.417 --> 14:30.750
with the Humans or
the Spirits anymore.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.292
Hmm. Well, look at that.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.667
I had forgotten that
they covered this wall.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.583
Come on, man. Somebody
painted that.

14:41.208 --> 14:44.375
It depicts a great
battle from long ago.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.250
What battle?

14:46.458 --> 14:49.042
The battle of Spirits and Humans

14:49.292 --> 14:51.208
against the Nian.

14:51.542 --> 14:52.542
What?

14:57.667 --> 14:59.417
<i>See for yourselves.</i>

15:04.333 --> 15:08.417
<i>A Nian was an ancient
and evil shape-shifter</i>

15:08.667 --> 15:12.934
<i>whose abilities were far greater
than that of a normal spirit.</i>

15:16.583 --> 15:19.208
<i>Its thirst for
power was endless.</i>

15:21.000 --> 15:24.833
<i>Seeking to conquer both the
Human and Spirit worlds.</i>

15:25.083 --> 15:27.417
<i>Too strong to be
defeated in battle,</i>

15:27.542 --> 15:30.292
<i>the Nian was split
into three parts.</i>

15:30.708 --> 15:34.250
<i>Each piece was locked away
in a secret location,</i>

15:36.333 --> 15:38.917
<i>bound by a mystical seal.</i>

15:39.542 --> 15:42.917
<i>It has remained
imprisoned ever since.</i>

15:44.625 --> 15:45.625
Huh.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.458
But Humans have
forgotten their history

15:48.583 --> 15:50.625
as time has slowly passed,

15:50.958 --> 15:54.417
that only by working together
and trusting each other

15:54.792 --> 15:58.167
could we conquer this evil that
had ravaged both our worlds.

15:58.417 --> 15:59.625
That's it, Shen Tu.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.333
- We should release the Nian.
- You're kidding.

16:02.458 --> 16:05.500
With the Nian free, the only
way to defeat it once more

16:05.708 --> 16:07.417
would be for Spirits
and Humans to unite.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.872
I feel like you missed the
"ancient" and "evil" part.

16:09.917 --> 16:13.625
You want to release a-a-a creature,
a really powerful monster,

16:14.042 --> 16:15.708
just so you can
help Humans again.

16:15.958 --> 16:18.083
That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard.

16:18.333 --> 16:19.917
Beckett, how do I
find the seals?

16:22.083 --> 16:23.208
Well...

16:30.375 --> 16:32.333
I know I shouldn't
tell you this but...

16:32.542 --> 16:35.375
- it's being guarded in the Human world.
- The Human world?

16:35.500 --> 16:37.167
Close to the village below.

16:37.792 --> 16:41.208
Take this with you. It will
show you the way to go.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.833
- But how?
- It's a leaf. Isn't it obvious?

16:44.958 --> 16:48.500
I won't stop you, but this is
a dangerous path to go down.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.917
If I free the Nian...

16:51.458 --> 16:53.417
Beckett, what do you
think would happen?

16:54.292 --> 16:57.583
It is... a great risk, but
your motives are pure.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.542
I understand what
you're feeling.

17:00.167 --> 17:03.083
In my day, I would've done
anything to help the Humans.

17:03.208 --> 17:07.125
But if the Mayor destroys all the portals,
our worlds will be separated forever.

17:07.250 --> 17:08.791
Now is the time to act.

17:09.791 --> 17:13.083
You must do what you
think is right.

17:31.500 --> 17:34.583
Luli, Rain. How are ya?

17:35.708 --> 17:38.000
Hi. Which soup would
you like today, Tony?

17:38.583 --> 17:40.750
- I would like...
- Grandpa, not smelly old soup.

17:40.875 --> 17:44.167
Every time, we get the same old thing.
No way!

17:44.583 --> 17:46.476
- We're going to the new place next door.
- Sorry. Sorry.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.500
Come on!

17:50.000 --> 17:54.375
<i>Ahh. Their old neighbor, Mr.
Rogman, up to his usual tricks.</i>

17:54.708 --> 17:55.708
Huh?

17:56.250 --> 17:58.375
- Hey, you look hungry, little guy.
- Huh?

17:58.500 --> 18:00.101
How about a burger and a shake?

18:00.125 --> 18:01.708
And get a load of this.

18:03.417 --> 18:05.583
- Ha ha. Hotdogs on the house.
- Ooh, wow!

18:05.750 --> 18:08.125
Upgrade your meal,
and get a free toy.

18:08.417 --> 18:10.042
Oh, sweet!

18:10.167 --> 18:13.250
This way to hotdog heaven.

18:15.708 --> 18:17.250
Hey, look out.

18:34.792 --> 18:37.958
Excuse me. Could you move
your truck away from my shop?

18:38.083 --> 18:41.083
It's noisy and it's
disturbing my customers.

18:41.458 --> 18:43.417
Excuse me. Would you mind?

18:45.583 --> 18:48.208
Huh? What do you mean customers?

18:48.333 --> 18:50.875
Don't make me laugh.
There are none.

18:51.542 --> 18:53.125
Hey! This shop is done.

18:53.292 --> 18:56.250
If I crank up the tunes, this
shop will crumble. Yeah!

18:56.375 --> 18:57.417
Get back!

18:57.542 --> 19:00.792
Make us!

19:06.250 --> 19:08.167
Yeah. Want some of this?

19:11.500 --> 19:13.167
Please, it's fine.

19:13.917 --> 19:14.917
See these?

19:16.875 --> 19:18.708
I have plans for a family.

19:19.833 --> 19:22.542
- Go! Now!
- Let's get out of here.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.417
- Wait. That's the thanks I get?
- Hmm.

19:30.542 --> 19:33.958
Listen, Luli. Running the
shop alone is hard work.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.500
- Couldn't you use a help of a man?
- No, thank you.

19:36.625 --> 19:37.625
We're doing fine.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.000
Just look at this place.

19:39.125 --> 19:41.042
There's no way you're
turning a profit.

19:41.167 --> 19:42.708
You only have seven tables here.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.000
Some days you don't have
that many customers.

19:47.458 --> 19:48.976
Water, heat, electricity.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.042
Not including the
ingredients for the soup.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.375
Which I've heard
hasn't changed...

19:53.667 --> 19:55.583
since the dinosaurs
ruled the world.

19:56.250 --> 19:58.042
Cool. So cool.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.292
But we're in a new era, Luli.

20:00.458 --> 20:01.667
An era of...

20:02.417 --> 20:03.542
gadgets.

20:03.667 --> 20:06.708
Now, we're neighbors, Luli, which
is almost like being family.

20:06.917 --> 20:08.458
So let's work together, huh?

20:08.625 --> 20:10.333
Just think of the possibilities.

20:10.458 --> 20:11.458
Let me buy your shop

20:11.583 --> 20:14.958
and you'll never have to worry about
making another bowl of soup again.

20:15.083 --> 20:18.167
We'll double in size and give us
more space than we'll ever need.

20:18.292 --> 20:21.601
- We'll call it Rogman's Emporium.
- Mr. Rogman, would you like a bowl?

20:21.625 --> 20:23.583
Uh, Rain, you're a sweetheart.

20:31.542 --> 20:33.458
Is it spicy enough for you?

20:36.875 --> 20:38.333
Give me a drink!

20:48.292 --> 20:49.917
Huh? Hm.

20:54.750 --> 20:55.750
Oh!

20:56.042 --> 20:57.042
Huh?

20:59.958 --> 21:00.958
Oh!

21:06.667 --> 21:09.542
Hey, boss. How did we do out there?
Are you OK?

21:10.042 --> 21:11.750
Get me water, you clowns!

21:11.875 --> 21:13.417
Come on, quick!

21:15.208 --> 21:16.375
Here you go, boss.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.708
I told you, you have to look tough.
You're both pathetic.

21:24.125 --> 21:27.375
- I thought we looked tough.
- I gave her my crazy eyes and everything.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.292
Hey, guys, can I play?

21:42.583 --> 21:44.083
Give it to me.

21:44.583 --> 21:46.875
- Here, catch.
- Over here.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.292
- Hey, let's go down the playground.
- Hi.

21:50.917 --> 21:54.000
Look, guys, it's the poor
little soup shop girl.

21:54.292 --> 21:55.458
Bye, loser.

21:55.917 --> 21:58.292
I heard her crazy grandma
believes in Spirits.

21:58.458 --> 22:00.917
Say hi to the Tooth
Fairy for us.

22:05.375 --> 22:08.708
Mom, I want to go back home.

22:09.625 --> 22:11.625
I don't like this
place much anymore.

22:11.833 --> 22:14.333
Rain, we just can't
do that right now.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.083
We promised Grandma we'd
take care of her shop,

22:17.250 --> 22:19.167
and we're gonna turn
this place around.

22:19.833 --> 22:22.917
This isn't our home, Mom.
It's not our shop.

22:23.625 --> 22:26.167
It is our shop, just
as it was Grandma's,

22:26.333 --> 22:29.250
and great Grandma's and
great-great Grandma's shop.

22:29.583 --> 22:30.958
But what about me, Mom?

22:31.208 --> 22:33.125
I don't even have
any friends here.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.625
Rain, things will work out.

22:35.875 --> 22:37.083
Just give it some time.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.500
I don't want it work out, Mom.

22:39.667 --> 22:41.958
This might be your home,
but it'll never be mine.

22:42.125 --> 22:43.542
I hate it here!

22:44.667 --> 22:45.667
Rain!

22:47.625 --> 22:48.958
<i>Poor Rain.</i>

22:49.167 --> 22:52.083
<i>Change can be as difficult
for young Humans</i>

22:52.500 --> 22:55.125
<i>as it is for old Spirits.</i>

23:04.542 --> 23:07.500
These late night curfew checks
might take some getting used to.

23:07.667 --> 23:10.375
Time to make some more snacks.

23:22.625 --> 23:24.708
Brother, I'm going
to find the Nian.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.917
OK, best of luck with that.

23:27.208 --> 23:28.500
I'll save you some cookies.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.500
Don't you want to
be a real Guardian?

23:30.750 --> 23:34.083
An old man tells you a story and off
you go to save the world again.

23:34.250 --> 23:36.375
You're trapped in the
glory days, my friend.

23:41.625 --> 23:43.833
Know what my problem is?
Cookies.

23:44.125 --> 23:46.208
So just here, have a cookie.

23:46.375 --> 23:49.458
Know what your problem is? You don't
know how to let go of the past.

23:49.625 --> 23:51.125
Maybe you should find a hobby.

23:51.250 --> 23:53.000
Try stamp collecting, anything.

23:53.125 --> 23:54.542
Just stop being a baby.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.125
Mighty babies coming.

23:56.250 --> 23:57.458
- Curfew check.
- Knock, knock.

23:57.583 --> 23:59.083
- Who's there?
- Mighty babies.

23:59.250 --> 24:00.458
Who cares? We're here.

24:01.333 --> 24:03.533
- Too dangerous.
- I hate these guys. You're like gnats!

24:07.750 --> 24:09.958
Hey! Knock it off, you two.

24:11.125 --> 24:12.250
Sorry, boss.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.667
- You scan the big guy.
- Give me a break already.

24:16.917 --> 24:17.917
- Uhh.
- Hey!

24:18.542 --> 24:20.417
I'll be back tomorrow
at midnight.

24:21.125 --> 24:26.167
- Until then, a letter from the Mayor.
- Shotgun! I call shotgun!

24:27.417 --> 24:28.417
Uh-oh.

24:28.875 --> 24:29.768
Huh?

24:29.792 --> 24:31.167
No.

24:31.583 --> 24:32.583
"Dearest Guardians.

24:32.708 --> 24:34.917
You're hereby required
to destroy your portal.

24:35.042 --> 24:36.833
Failure to comply
will result in..."

24:37.417 --> 24:38.417
Banishment?

24:38.625 --> 24:40.167
Yu Lei, what are we gonna do?

24:40.417 --> 24:42.667
What can we do? This
is really happening.

24:42.958 --> 24:44.375
What other skills do I have?

24:44.583 --> 24:46.708
I can make cookies. Or cakes.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.917
No.

24:49.583 --> 24:51.708
We were meant for greater
things, brother.

24:52.542 --> 24:53.583
Yu Lei...

24:53.708 --> 24:55.333
I'm done following their rules.

24:57.292 --> 24:58.833
<i>You're breaking the law.</i>

25:00.708 --> 25:02.542
I'm never gonna be
like you, brother.

25:02.958 --> 25:05.583
It might be extreme, but
at least I know who I am.

25:11.708 --> 25:12.875
Have fun baking cookies.

25:14.833 --> 25:16.333
What is wrong with cookies?

25:16.708 --> 25:18.583
We're back.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.292
- Going somewhere?
- Where is your cuter brother?

25:21.417 --> 25:23.625
- Is he nude?
- Nude or invisible.

25:23.875 --> 25:25.792
- What exactly is going on here?
- Dancing.

25:25.917 --> 25:27.542
- As if.
- Yeah, just warming up.

25:27.667 --> 25:28.667
Hmm.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.375
There? No.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.792
- Not over here.
- You're really acting strange.

25:35.042 --> 25:36.167
Nothing here either.

25:36.292 --> 25:38.750
Are you sure you don't
have anything to tell me?

25:39.125 --> 25:40.625
Come on, boss. We're done here.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.917
Two more to do, then
I'm going clubbing.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.167
Up and away.

25:45.292 --> 25:46.625
You should leave.

25:46.750 --> 25:48.167
I'd take down that poster.

26:00.958 --> 26:01.958
Mmm.

26:11.583 --> 26:13.792
Pick on someone your own size!

26:14.667 --> 26:16.792
Oops! Bad idea.

26:31.458 --> 26:32.667
Oh, no.

26:35.917 --> 26:37.417
Ha ha! See ya!

26:38.042 --> 26:39.250
That's right.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.250
Can't see.

26:46.167 --> 26:47.167
Uhh...

26:49.417 --> 26:50.958
Nice doggies.

26:51.333 --> 26:52.375
Oh, no.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.000
Accept an apology?

26:55.333 --> 26:57.458
Whoa. Wow.

27:01.333 --> 27:04.542
Whoa! Awesome! How
did you do that?

27:05.500 --> 27:08.167
Um, I'm Rain. Who are you?

27:15.667 --> 27:18.000
- Uh...
- I'm Yu Lei. Nice to meet you.

27:21.958 --> 27:24.833
Uh, you're not from
here, are you?

27:28.542 --> 27:29.542
Hm!

27:29.958 --> 27:31.417
No, I'm not from here.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.934
Something kind of
told me you weren't.

27:33.958 --> 27:35.333
<i>Ho, ho, hey.</i>

27:35.708 --> 27:37.792
Uh, I'm a Guardian.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.917
Oh. Like a Jedi?

27:41.750 --> 27:43.083
I suppose so.

27:43.292 --> 27:45.833
But I'm on an important
mission right now.

27:48.042 --> 27:50.125
Well, thank you for helping me.

27:51.292 --> 27:52.292
Hm.

27:57.042 --> 27:58.042
Hmm.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.708
Take this. It will protect you.

28:09.167 --> 28:10.875
It's so pretty.

28:11.500 --> 28:13.458
Huh. I knew it.

28:13.958 --> 28:16.750
Been here five minutes and
I've already helped someone.

28:17.375 --> 28:19.500
Guess I am on the
right path after all.

28:21.792 --> 28:23.125
But don't go.

28:45.625 --> 28:47.292
I'm sorry, Mom.

28:47.833 --> 28:49.625
Rain! There you are!

28:51.083 --> 28:53.333
I was so worried.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.125
I can't lose you, too.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Huh?

29:12.167 --> 29:13.167
Hm.

29:20.833 --> 29:21.833
Oh!

29:24.167 --> 29:26.833
Whoa.

29:36.333 --> 29:37.333
Ha!

29:55.042 --> 29:59.625
Who dares disturb the
great grass monster?

30:00.667 --> 30:02.958
Trespassers are not welcome,

30:03.167 --> 30:05.042
but I'm always glad
to see you, Yu Lei.

30:05.167 --> 30:06.167
Colossus!

30:06.250 --> 30:09.042
- Yeah, it's me!
- I'm breaking.

30:09.750 --> 30:12.667
Wee! Wait! A little bit slower.

30:13.417 --> 30:14.417
Wait!

30:21.458 --> 30:22.625
What-what...

30:22.917 --> 30:24.250
What are you?

30:25.542 --> 30:28.292
Whoa! Hey, wait. Where
are you taking me?

30:29.250 --> 30:31.917
The Mayor told me to protect
this seal, right here.

30:32.708 --> 30:35.542
It'll mess up his plan
if someone broke... it.

30:36.042 --> 30:39.083
I'm so bored, I've taken up portraiture.
Started with Confucius.

30:39.208 --> 30:41.518
- What do you think of the likeness?
- Ahh...

30:41.542 --> 30:43.708
If you don't want to be
here, why do you stay?

30:44.833 --> 30:46.625
The Mayor says I'm
helping the cause.

30:46.792 --> 30:48.083
Whatever that means.

30:48.208 --> 30:50.208
The seal you're guarding
holds the Nian.

30:50.417 --> 30:52.625
Huh? Nian? Never heard of it.

30:53.208 --> 30:55.125
One, two, three...

30:56.667 --> 30:58.792
Wait. Yu Lei, why are you here?

30:59.125 --> 31:00.792
- I'm here to break the seal.
- What?

31:01.125 --> 31:02.292
Awesome!

31:02.458 --> 31:04.667
I've always wanted to team
up with the great Yu Lei.

31:04.833 --> 31:06.083
This job is so dull.

31:06.208 --> 31:08.167
Oh! What will happen
when we break the seal?

31:08.333 --> 31:10.625
- Oh, the Nian will attack us.
- Right. Huh?

31:10.750 --> 31:13.875
Did you say attack? What?
Are you kidding?

31:14.708 --> 31:16.375
I'd rather not be
a part of that.

31:16.625 --> 31:17.917
Fine. Suit yourself.

31:18.083 --> 31:20.000
Do you really have
to do this, Yu Lei?

31:21.125 --> 31:22.333
Yes, I do.

31:22.833 --> 31:25.833
Ah! I'm so conflicted!
What do I do?

31:26.125 --> 31:28.250
I could let Yu Lei
break the seal.

31:28.458 --> 31:29.792
But then I'd get in trouble!

31:30.125 --> 31:32.667
Forget it. I was
hired to do a job.

31:33.333 --> 31:36.167
Wink.

31:42.333 --> 31:45.125
You know what? At least they
can't say I didn't try.

31:45.667 --> 31:48.750
Yu Lei, good luck with the
whole seal breaking thing.

31:48.875 --> 31:52.250
And remember, if the Mayor
asks, I put up a good fight!

32:14.625 --> 32:17.583
<i>It was hard to believe that
such a gentle creature</i>

32:17.750 --> 32:21.125
<i>could represent the first
obstacle in Yu Lei's path</i>

32:21.292 --> 32:24.000
<i>to the terror and
chaos of the Nian.</i>

32:30.833 --> 32:32.375
<i>But it wasn't a fish at all.</i>

32:32.500 --> 32:36.458
<i>It was a dragon, with the power
to suck the riverbed dry.</i>

32:36.958 --> 32:40.625
<i>But the dragon needed more
than water to fuel the Nian.</i>

32:40.750 --> 32:42.833
<i>It needed a part of Yu Lei, too.</i>

32:43.000 --> 32:45.750
<i>His power and even his youth.</i>

32:46.125 --> 32:49.417
Huh? No. What have
you done, Yu Lei?

32:55.750 --> 32:57.542
Whoa! What is that?

32:57.875 --> 32:58.875
Whoa.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.042
Ow. Ah!

33:56.917 --> 33:57.917
What?

33:58.042 --> 34:00.125
Hey, Rain. There's no water.

34:00.250 --> 34:01.792
Do you know anything about this?

34:02.250 --> 34:03.500
No, Mom.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.333
But I was home all night.

34:05.500 --> 34:08.417
Definitely didn't sneak off to
the woods or do anything crazy.

34:08.542 --> 34:11.125
All right, I'll see you later.
I'm off to school. Bye.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.625
That's so weird.

34:14.042 --> 34:15.208
Maybe a pipe burst?

34:15.750 --> 34:17.583
Nope! Whole town's out of water.

34:17.708 --> 34:18.958
Couldn't even take a bath.

34:19.167 --> 34:22.417
I ask you... Where do our taxes go?
Right?

34:22.542 --> 34:23.958
- Got bottled water?
- No, I...

34:24.083 --> 34:25.333
Well, why don't you?

34:25.833 --> 34:27.768
One must always be prepared.

34:27.792 --> 34:29.750
- Uh, I'll go get some from the stream.
- What?

34:29.917 --> 34:32.000
The stream is as
dry as that tap.

34:32.125 --> 34:33.625
Here. Look for yourself.

34:34.458 --> 34:36.708
The whole town is
talking about it.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.292
- When did that happen?
- No one knows.

34:39.417 --> 34:41.708
- Sometime last night.
- But how?

34:42.208 --> 34:43.458
And what do we do now?

34:43.583 --> 34:47.458
Well, you can wait days while the
water company fixes the problem,

34:47.667 --> 34:49.750
or you can use my reserve.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.875
I have loads of extra water you
can use any time of the day.

34:53.250 --> 34:56.292
Thanks, but no. I-I wouldn't
want to inconvenience you.

34:56.417 --> 34:57.917
Oh, but I want you to.

34:58.208 --> 35:01.750
If we can't help our neighbors in times
of trouble, then who can we help?

35:02.042 --> 35:03.917
- Don't move. I'll get the hose.
- But...

35:05.625 --> 35:07.042
Come on. Go, go, go, go.

35:08.167 --> 35:10.000
Got it right here. Here you go.

35:10.667 --> 35:11.958
It's OK.

35:12.583 --> 35:15.917
Uh, well, that's very kind.

35:19.375 --> 35:20.375
Again?

35:22.208 --> 35:23.917
Out of the way, lame brain!

35:28.125 --> 35:30.583
Hey, water's coming!

35:35.792 --> 35:37.917
Got it. Thank you so much.

35:55.625 --> 35:56.792
Enjoy.

35:57.250 --> 35:58.875
Mmm. Smells so good.

36:13.542 --> 36:15.000
That's not good. Ow!

36:15.542 --> 36:16.542
Uhh...

36:25.833 --> 36:27.542
Hey, I can't hold it.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.125
Me first.

36:29.375 --> 36:30.917
Oh, come on.

36:31.292 --> 36:32.917
I just can't wait anymore.

36:34.250 --> 36:35.625
Excuse me.

36:39.333 --> 36:42.292
- We've had reports of contaminated food.
- Oh, my butt!

36:42.792 --> 36:45.393
Your customers all seem to have...
the runs.

36:45.417 --> 36:47.333
No. I mean, it just
started happening...

36:47.500 --> 36:49.917
The shop looks clean
enough on the surface.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.292
Maybe it's the
ingredients you use.

36:53.792 --> 36:55.000
Impossible.

36:55.125 --> 36:58.208
We haven't changed anything, and
I've never had a problem before.

37:00.667 --> 37:02.875
The complaint that was
filed against you said

37:03.000 --> 37:04.792
the cause of the diarrhea,

37:05.792 --> 37:07.167
- is the soup stock.
- Never.

37:07.375 --> 37:10.667
That can't be. Our recipe is
over a hundred years old.

37:11.208 --> 37:12.833
There's no way it's the stock.

37:13.333 --> 37:15.292
A hundred years old, eh?

37:16.625 --> 37:17.625
Huh.

37:17.917 --> 37:20.542
I think that answers our
question then, right?

37:21.167 --> 37:22.750
You're selling rotten soup.

37:22.875 --> 37:24.708
The soup is fine.

37:26.333 --> 37:28.750
<i>Luli was right. The
soup was fine.</i>

37:28.917 --> 37:31.208
<i>It was their slimy old
neighbor that was rotten.</i>

37:31.375 --> 37:35.167
<i>But that didn't stop the Health
Department from closing their shop.</i>

37:39.000 --> 37:44.208
We can only hope that it
all works out in the end.

37:46.917 --> 37:48.375
It's OK, Mom.

37:52.625 --> 37:53.684
<i>In traffic news.</i>

37:53.708 --> 37:57.500
<i>A giant tortoise collided with a
flying terrapin outside the city.</i>

37:57.625 --> 37:59.292
<i>It was a "turtle" disaster.</i>

38:00.375 --> 38:02.083
Colossus, what are
you doing here?

38:03.125 --> 38:05.250
Shen Tu, I got bad news for you.

38:05.875 --> 38:06.917
Cookies!

38:08.500 --> 38:10.708
Yu Lei was down on Earth.
He attacked me.

38:11.250 --> 38:13.417
- You kidding me?
- No.

38:13.583 --> 38:15.250
He was acting all
crazy and stuff.

38:15.458 --> 38:18.583
He smashed me up against a boulder.
Just thought you should know.

38:18.708 --> 38:20.000
But my...

38:20.500 --> 38:22.958
I got to go. But please,
don't tell the Mayor.

38:25.708 --> 38:28.125
Oh, come on! At least
tell me how those tasted.

38:28.250 --> 38:30.167
They were delicious!

38:37.875 --> 38:39.417
Yu Lei, where are you?

38:45.292 --> 38:46.932
I can't believe you're
making me do this.

39:02.292 --> 39:03.292
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

39:03.417 --> 39:04.417
What?

39:08.458 --> 39:09.708
Yu Lei?

39:10.958 --> 39:12.125
This place is a mess.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.792
It's been so long since we
used any of these portals.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.750
Are there even any
posters of us left?

39:17.833 --> 39:18.958
What the...

39:19.167 --> 39:20.167
Hey!

39:21.958 --> 39:22.958
This must be it.

39:35.333 --> 39:36.500
Uh, uh, oh!

39:41.583 --> 39:43.458
OK, where am I?

39:57.708 --> 39:59.375
Not you again.

40:09.667 --> 40:12.292
Shoo! Shoo! Get
back, all of you!

40:13.042 --> 40:14.458
Shoo! Get back!

40:16.917 --> 40:17.917
Ow.

40:19.875 --> 40:21.708
Sit! Stay!

40:22.542 --> 40:24.375
Uh, roll over?

40:28.750 --> 40:30.292
I'll give you treats.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.625
Get out of here! Go scare
some cats, you jerks!

40:36.792 --> 40:37.792
You came back!

40:41.792 --> 40:43.833
Oh. You're not him.

40:44.083 --> 40:45.333
Uh, where...

40:45.708 --> 40:47.583
- W... How...
- Thank you.

40:49.833 --> 40:52.625
Now, who gave you...
Where'd you get that?

40:52.750 --> 40:55.417
It's a gift from a friend.
You probably don't know him.

40:56.042 --> 40:58.083
Unless you're a Guardian, too.

40:58.292 --> 40:59.792
Come on, I'm on a mission.

41:00.333 --> 41:02.417
- Hey, wait.
- You're not much of a talker, are you?

41:03.208 --> 41:05.500
We're going to pay the Health
Inspector a little visit.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.167
Please let us open
our soup shop again.

41:15.417 --> 41:16.417
Please.

41:22.958 --> 41:23.958
Sorry.

41:29.542 --> 41:30.542
Mmm?

41:30.958 --> 41:32.833
I recognize you.

41:33.792 --> 41:37.125
Wow! From the Halloween
dancing competition.

41:38.125 --> 41:40.333
You must remember
my awesome costume.

41:40.625 --> 41:43.625
The peacock, when I wore
the wonderful evening.

41:47.083 --> 41:48.375
Uh, what's happening?

41:48.542 --> 41:50.292
Uh, I think he thinks
I'm someone else.

41:54.250 --> 41:55.250
Ooh.

41:58.208 --> 41:59.250
OK.

41:59.708 --> 42:00.708
Mm-hmm.

42:04.708 --> 42:09.083
Very well, later today, I'll
come by your shop again.

42:10.125 --> 42:12.625
If you pass the
inspection this time,

42:13.625 --> 42:17.167
we'll allow you to reopen your
shop effective immediately.

42:17.583 --> 42:20.333
- Yay! Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Yay!

42:23.458 --> 42:24.625
Come on.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Come on, we got to tell Mom.

42:28.167 --> 42:29.250
Wait up.

42:30.042 --> 42:32.583
Mom, guess what? The Health
Inspector is coming back.

42:32.750 --> 42:34.768
If we pass, we can open again.

42:34.792 --> 42:37.625
And this is my friend.
He's gonna help us clean.

42:37.958 --> 42:39.583
- Right?
- Really?

42:39.708 --> 42:42.042
How nice of you. But
those clothes won't do.

42:42.708 --> 42:43.792
Ow!

42:44.167 --> 42:45.167
Easy, lady.

42:54.417 --> 42:57.458
That's better. So nice of
you to help us clean up.

42:57.667 --> 42:58.667
Here.

43:00.458 --> 43:01.458
Huh? Mmm.

43:03.542 --> 43:04.625
What?

43:07.750 --> 43:08.958
Wow!

43:29.083 --> 43:30.167
What?

43:30.500 --> 43:31.500
Oops!

43:39.792 --> 43:42.083
That's you, on the poster.

43:42.750 --> 43:44.167
Uhh, hmm...

43:44.500 --> 43:46.542
Those are Grandma's
old Spirit posters.

43:47.542 --> 43:48.792
Spirits, huh?

43:49.833 --> 43:51.583
They remind me of someone.

43:52.292 --> 43:53.667
They're Guardian Spirits.

43:54.125 --> 43:55.893
What do Guardian
Spirits do, Mom?

43:55.917 --> 43:57.143
I don't know.

43:57.167 --> 43:58.875
I think they're
just make-believe.

43:59.167 --> 44:01.083
But your grandma thought
they were real.

44:01.250 --> 44:04.750
She'd tell me stories about how
they watched over us all the time.

44:05.042 --> 44:08.083
Wow! Are the Door Guardians
really that powerful?

44:08.250 --> 44:09.250
Mm-hmm.

44:12.583 --> 44:15.625
Sorry about that.

44:18.625 --> 44:19.625
Hm.

44:19.792 --> 44:21.417
Are we ready?

44:55.417 --> 44:56.708
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

44:57.625 --> 44:58.625
Ah!

44:59.417 --> 45:00.417
Huh?

45:04.125 --> 45:05.125
Wha...

45:12.208 --> 45:13.208
Hm.

45:28.917 --> 45:29.917
Aww.

45:30.875 --> 45:33.333
Blowing kisses won't
affect my decision.

45:49.833 --> 45:50.917
Smells good.

45:51.708 --> 45:55.208
So you can now reopen your shop.

45:58.625 --> 45:59.958
Oh, no!

46:04.292 --> 46:05.292
Ah!

46:07.083 --> 46:08.083
Huh.

46:13.875 --> 46:14.875
Hmm.

46:19.667 --> 46:22.333
Looks like they're coming
from Rogman's kitchen.

46:29.167 --> 46:30.250
Gross!

46:32.083 --> 46:34.000
- Uh-huh.
- You are so busted.

46:35.750 --> 46:36.833
Why?

46:37.417 --> 46:38.875
Right this way. Step right in.

46:39.042 --> 46:41.583
You think you've won.
We'll just see.

46:42.042 --> 46:43.458
Come in, come in, come in!

46:43.583 --> 46:45.083
Hello! Welcome to our shop.

46:45.208 --> 46:47.000
- Here's your soup, sir.
- Thank you.

46:47.250 --> 46:49.000
Hello. We'll be right with you.

46:49.167 --> 46:50.458
Welcome. Hello.

46:50.833 --> 46:53.458
I helped the Humans and
it felt really good.

46:54.333 --> 46:56.125
Have I been wrong
this whole time?

46:58.083 --> 47:01.583
- Thank you so much for your help.
- My pleasure.

47:02.458 --> 47:04.559
Well, Rain, my job is done here.

47:04.583 --> 47:06.875
Um, I know who you are, Shen Tu.

47:07.125 --> 47:09.250
Um, what makes you say that?

47:09.417 --> 47:12.000
You're the Guardians from the poster.
You and Yu Lei.

47:12.125 --> 47:15.208
OK, OK, you're absolutely
right, but I have to find him.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.125
Do you have any
idea where he is?

47:18.792 --> 47:19.792
Whoa.

47:20.833 --> 47:22.375
We're about to find out.

47:22.708 --> 47:23.708
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

47:27.500 --> 47:29.000
Wahoo!

48:02.208 --> 48:03.917
You've entered a
restricted area.

48:04.042 --> 48:05.917
You must leave immediately.

48:06.250 --> 48:07.875
What? Bloom?

48:09.917 --> 48:11.125
Is that...

48:12.875 --> 48:13.875
Yu Lei?

48:14.417 --> 48:15.542
You're here?

48:16.458 --> 48:20.083
Are you here for the dance lesson I
promised you at the Mayor's shindig?

48:20.458 --> 48:22.917
- Did he send you here?
- What's it to you?

48:23.042 --> 48:25.667
You certainly never
cared about me before.

48:26.250 --> 48:29.250
Why do you suddenly care
about me now, Yu Lei?

48:30.667 --> 48:32.875
Yu Lei, you look older.

48:33.042 --> 48:34.833
What's happening to your face?

48:35.458 --> 48:37.958
- I broke one of the seals.
- A seal?

48:38.708 --> 48:40.375
Yes, just like this seal.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.708
Why would you do that?

48:43.250 --> 48:44.667
Why do you guard the seal?

48:44.875 --> 48:46.167
Well, it is a job.

48:47.458 --> 48:49.750
Humans don't want us
guarding them anymore.

48:50.417 --> 48:53.500
Can't you take a hint?
They're not interested.

48:53.917 --> 48:56.083
You're wrong. That's
why I'm here.

48:56.500 --> 48:57.708
Stay out of my way.

48:57.917 --> 49:00.167
Yu Lei, don't be so rude.

49:01.625 --> 49:03.333
You can't break the
seal on my watch.

49:03.875 --> 49:06.833
- If you do while I'm here, I'll...
- lose my job.

49:07.333 --> 49:08.833
And then, I'll be mad.

49:09.167 --> 49:10.542
And, so what?

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
I...

49:12.667 --> 49:13.875
So what?

49:14.583 --> 49:15.833
Get over yourself.

49:15.958 --> 49:18.184
Could you once think
about other Spirits?

49:18.208 --> 49:19.833
What they want? What they feel?

49:20.000 --> 49:21.167
It's all about Yu Lei.

49:21.292 --> 49:23.625
What Yu Lei wants. What
Yu Lei thinks is best.

49:23.750 --> 49:25.768
But the world doesn't
revolve around you.

49:25.792 --> 49:28.625
Who do you think you are to decide
what's best for everyone else?

49:29.083 --> 49:30.792
The one who's doing something.

49:31.417 --> 49:32.458
Now, back off!

50:14.042 --> 50:17.750
I promise, what I'm
doing is right.

50:20.750 --> 50:22.583
Yu Lei.

50:24.833 --> 50:26.208
Not a big jogger.

50:26.917 --> 50:28.208
I gotta get better shoes.

50:30.500 --> 50:32.375
Hey, look there.

50:41.458 --> 50:44.958
Yu Lei, stop trying
to change the world.

51:04.292 --> 51:05.292
Huh?

51:07.292 --> 51:08.333
You...

51:09.458 --> 51:11.000
You've broken the seal.

51:16.292 --> 51:19.667
Yu Lei! Yu Lei, no!

51:23.292 --> 51:24.417
Bloom!

51:32.417 --> 51:34.792
Something is calling me.

51:37.750 --> 51:38.750
Careful.

51:52.417 --> 51:54.125
- What's going on?
- Oh, my goodness.

51:56.125 --> 51:57.833
Where are they coming from?

52:03.542 --> 52:04.542
Yu Lei?

52:05.250 --> 52:06.583
You're getting older.

52:06.875 --> 52:08.042
Yu Lei.

52:09.292 --> 52:13.625
That's... that's two seals broken, brother.
Just one more left.

52:14.500 --> 52:16.125
Forget about the seals.

52:16.667 --> 52:18.208
Look at yourself, Yu Lei.

52:18.417 --> 52:20.167
- This is the price I must pay.
- What?

52:20.333 --> 52:21.500
The price?

52:22.000 --> 52:24.500
What about the price everyone
else has to pay, huh?

52:24.750 --> 52:27.000
The world is turning
upside down, Yu Lei.

52:27.208 --> 52:28.500
You've got to stop.

52:31.333 --> 52:32.708
Rain, tell him.

52:32.958 --> 52:35.417
How they had to open the
dams to refill the river.

52:35.667 --> 52:37.083
He's right, Yu Lei.

52:37.458 --> 52:39.833
The water's gone. We almost
had to close our shop.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.208
How can you possibly not
see what you're doing?

52:42.500 --> 52:44.125
You're going to
destroy the world.

52:44.458 --> 52:45.708
This has got to stop.

52:46.333 --> 52:48.292
No, it doesn't.

52:50.458 --> 52:54.125
Stop, please! Yu Lei!

53:17.000 --> 53:19.125
<i>Now that the second
seal was broken,</i>

53:19.292 --> 53:22.875
<i>Rain and Shen Tu knew that
time was running out.</i>

53:23.750 --> 53:28.375
<i>Who knew what catastrophes would
happen if the third seal was broken.</i>

53:29.208 --> 53:32.875
<i>They had to stop Yu Lei from
breaking that final seal.</i>

53:37.625 --> 53:40.417
- I need to take this.
- Hey, that's mine.

53:40.542 --> 53:43.184
- It puts you in danger.
- It's supposed to protect me.

53:43.208 --> 53:46.250
When my stubborn brother tries to
break the final seal out there,

53:46.500 --> 53:47.792
I'll need this to find him.

53:47.917 --> 53:49.917
- Give it back.
- Let me handle this, Rain. Please.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.042
It's mine, not yours.

53:55.792 --> 53:57.167
I'm sorry, Rain.

53:58.208 --> 53:59.208
Hey!

53:59.875 --> 54:00.917
Shen Tu?

54:01.375 --> 54:02.375
Wha...

54:03.583 --> 54:04.583
Wha...

54:10.625 --> 54:12.667
Ah!

54:16.958 --> 54:18.750
Come back.

54:30.583 --> 54:32.333
Huh? What?

54:37.458 --> 54:39.208
This does not look good.

54:42.167 --> 54:43.167
Ah!

54:46.958 --> 54:49.083
Oh, this is definitely not good.

54:52.583 --> 54:54.208
I will bring you back, buddy.

55:00.208 --> 55:05.167
Grandpa, why are we back at the place
where you pooped your pants? Aww.

55:05.667 --> 55:08.000
No, that was something I had...

55:08.375 --> 55:09.917
uh, for breakfast that day.

55:10.042 --> 55:11.500
I hate soup.

55:12.583 --> 55:14.750
- Rain?
- Yeah.

55:28.500 --> 55:30.458
Another bowl, please.

55:30.708 --> 55:32.292
I'll be right with you.

55:34.917 --> 55:36.542
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.125
Enjoy.

55:40.500 --> 55:43.000
Huh? Hey, what's in there?

55:43.333 --> 55:46.708
Hmm. I don't know. Maybe
it's a new recipe.

55:48.250 --> 55:50.667
- I wonder what makes it that red color?
- Huh?

55:53.875 --> 55:54.875
Wait.

55:59.542 --> 56:02.250
Grandpa, this is the
best soup ever!

56:05.667 --> 56:07.375
I want more, right now!

56:08.208 --> 56:09.208
Woah!

56:30.083 --> 56:30.976
Huh?

56:31.000 --> 56:34.500
Wow. Luli, this
soup takes me back.

56:34.625 --> 56:36.083
It reminds me of your mother.

56:36.333 --> 56:38.833
So sweet and spicy.
Two more, please.

56:38.958 --> 56:40.792
- Yes, for me too.
- For me too.

56:41.375 --> 56:42.875
- I'll take another.
- Sure.

57:04.125 --> 57:08.333
Yay, Rain, this new petal
soup is a huge success!

57:08.667 --> 57:10.792
But, Mom, there's no...

57:11.208 --> 57:12.625
What's the matter, huh?

57:13.333 --> 57:14.875
We should celebrate.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.875
This is the best day the
shop's had in years.

57:18.750 --> 57:22.125
But we... we used up all our
petals and we don't have anymore.

57:23.500 --> 57:24.768
We'll get more.

57:24.792 --> 57:26.792
Don't you know petals
grow on trees?

57:27.542 --> 57:30.125
The petals are all gone,
Mom, like Shen Tu.

57:30.625 --> 57:33.083
Huh? Did you say Shen Tu?

57:33.667 --> 57:35.667
He left without saying goodbye?

57:37.083 --> 57:38.625
I'm sorry, Rain.

58:05.167 --> 58:07.625
The world is filled with
other spices, Rain.

58:08.167 --> 58:10.042
Maybe it's time for us...

58:10.875 --> 58:13.792
to do some things a
little differently.

58:14.292 --> 58:17.000
But, Mom, do you really want
to change the family recipe?

58:17.292 --> 58:18.333
Yes!

58:18.583 --> 58:21.250
It's been in our family
for over a hundred years.

58:21.417 --> 58:23.708
It's great-great Grandma's
original recipe.

58:25.042 --> 58:26.167
I know.

58:26.333 --> 58:29.583
But the world is always changing
and tastes change, too.

58:29.708 --> 58:32.333
- So we'll change.
- OK!

58:33.708 --> 58:36.208
<i>So they did what
Grandma wouldn't.</i>

58:36.833 --> 58:38.417
<i>They changed the recipe.</i>

58:39.208 --> 58:41.917
<i>- Not all outcomes were successful,</i>
- Ick!

58:42.250 --> 58:44.125
<i>Or even edible.</i>

58:45.125 --> 58:48.917
<i>But a person who never makes
mistakes never tries anything new,</i>

58:49.083 --> 58:51.542
<i>and that's how all great
things are discovered.</i>

58:55.917 --> 58:58.083
- Rain, give me a hand.
- OK.

58:59.833 --> 59:00.833
Whoa!

59:01.208 --> 59:03.000
- Rain, another bowl.
- Yeah, sure.

59:03.542 --> 59:05.250
I love the new soup, Rain.

59:05.417 --> 59:07.250
- Would you like some more?
- Thank you.

59:07.542 --> 59:08.542
Whoa!

59:09.042 --> 59:12.458
- Rain, what an awesome soup recipe.
- Thank you.

59:13.667 --> 59:16.000
- What?
- No, you. You go.

59:17.125 --> 59:18.125
Hi.

59:23.958 --> 59:26.250
Wow, that's very good.

59:26.792 --> 59:29.375
- Thanks, Rain.
- What? Hey.

59:30.500 --> 59:32.583
They're for you. You
hang them on your door.

59:32.917 --> 59:35.167
- I'll hang one on my door.
- Me too.

59:35.333 --> 59:36.667
- Thanks.
- It's so cool.

59:36.833 --> 59:38.833
Rain, do you want to
come over and play?

59:39.125 --> 59:40.875
- We can hang out together.
- Yeah.

59:41.083 --> 59:42.083
Surprise!

59:47.583 --> 59:48.583
Hey!

59:49.333 --> 59:51.417
- Come on.
- It's fun. Come on.

59:52.625 --> 59:54.125
Hey, want to go play with them?

59:56.458 --> 59:57.833
Hey, happy new year!

59:57.958 --> 01:00:00.875
- Rain, here.
- Thank you.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.375
Hey, morons! Get busy selling!

01:00:05.375 --> 01:00:07.542
Menu! Menu!

01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:16.333
The final seal must
be in that building.

01:00:35.458 --> 01:00:36.667
What is this?

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:40.500
These statues and posters,
they all look like me.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.792
But they're hundreds
of years old.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.417
It's the fish from
the first seal.

01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:50.333
That's the second seal.
How is this possible?

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:00.875
Who did this?

01:01:09.292 --> 01:01:12.500
- You like them? I made them for you.
- Huh?

01:01:12.792 --> 01:01:13.792
Hyah!

01:01:14.042 --> 01:01:16.042
What is this place? Who are you?

01:01:16.583 --> 01:01:19.167
Oh. Just an old man.

01:01:19.333 --> 01:01:20.458
And how do you know me?

01:01:20.958 --> 01:01:22.583
How could I not know you?

01:01:23.167 --> 01:01:25.143
The great Yu Lei.

01:01:25.167 --> 01:01:27.792
Although it seems your glory
days are long behind you.

01:01:28.167 --> 01:01:31.083
Just look at yourself,
weak and alone.

01:01:31.458 --> 01:01:34.000
Even your brother
has abandoned you.

01:01:34.542 --> 01:01:36.667
- Lucky for you I'm here to help.
- Why?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.042
Why?

01:01:38.917 --> 01:01:40.833
You and I want the same thing.

01:01:41.292 --> 01:01:43.458
For the Nian to be
free once more.

01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:47.250
But once I free the Nian, I'm gonna
unite everyone to defeat it.

01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:49.042
Of course you will.

01:01:49.375 --> 01:01:54.000
By now, I'm sure you've begun to feel
the effects of breaking the seals.

01:01:54.417 --> 01:01:58.833
A lesser Spirit would have
been consumed entirely.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.042
You should be honored
that the Nian chose you.

01:02:02.792 --> 01:02:05.500
You say the Nian chose me?

01:02:11.083 --> 01:02:14.184
Their secret recipe has gotta
be here somewhere, I know it.

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:17.833
Hmm.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.500
Ah.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Hmm.

01:02:22.958 --> 01:02:23.958
Oh!

01:02:41.292 --> 01:02:42.875
Hundred-year-old soup.

01:02:43.833 --> 01:02:47.208
Let's just see if this little
ingredient is a success

01:02:47.333 --> 01:02:49.833
when it explodes all
over your walls.

01:02:56.042 --> 01:02:57.375
Not so fast.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.542
I saw what you did.
I'm telling my mom.

01:03:01.292 --> 01:03:02.958
I'll just shut you up then.

01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:13.167
I'm a Guardian Spirit,
but I'm also a brother.

01:03:13.292 --> 01:03:16.042
If saving the world means
defeating Yu Lei, then so be it.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:17.833
I'm ready. I'm pumped.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.250
- I'm...
- Breaking the law?

01:03:19.417 --> 01:03:20.500
What the...

01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:22.333
Oh!

01:03:23.458 --> 01:03:25.125
You are so busted!

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.292
Here's his magic
blow pipe thing.

01:03:28.542 --> 01:03:29.583
So?

01:03:29.708 --> 01:03:32.292
Oh, you found my suit.
Thanks, Dean.

01:03:32.417 --> 01:03:34.617
You know I'm always misplacing
stuff, so I'll just be...

01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:36.934
- So it's your suit?
- Yeah!

01:03:36.958 --> 01:03:38.226
- Did it shrink in the wash?
- A little.

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:40.083
- Are these your underpants?
- No.

01:03:40.542 --> 01:03:42.542
- You're a liar!
- That's a fib!

01:03:43.042 --> 01:03:44.500
You were already on thin ice.

01:03:44.625 --> 01:03:46.125
It's your last chance, Shen Tu.

01:03:46.292 --> 01:03:49.750
Tell me where he is right now,
or you'll both be banished!

01:03:50.333 --> 01:03:53.167
- Kicked out of the Spirit world forever!
- For good.

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:56.375
No one believes in Guardian Spirits
and those silly posters anymore.

01:03:56.625 --> 01:03:58.458
- You're through!
- No!

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.792
You are through!

01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:05.458
Get out!

01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:12.125
Please spare us, mighty giant.

01:04:12.292 --> 01:04:13.750
We don't taste very good.

01:04:13.875 --> 01:04:15.208
We have dreams!

01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:17.083
I'm just an intern.

01:04:18.583 --> 01:04:20.208
Ah! Teeth!

01:04:22.083 --> 01:04:24.375
Get in here, you
wormy slime ball.

01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:28.500
<i>Let us out of here!</i>

01:04:28.958 --> 01:04:31.042
<i>You monster! Let us out!</i>

01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:33.750
This can get real sticky.
That's very good. Yummy.

01:04:33.917 --> 01:04:35.625
OK, get in there. Good, OK.

01:04:35.792 --> 01:04:38.750
Poster up, portal should work.
Portal, come on, come on, work.

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:39.917
Mmmm!

01:04:45.417 --> 01:04:46.417
Whoa!

01:04:48.708 --> 01:04:49.708
What?

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:50.917
Which one is it?

01:04:51.792 --> 01:04:53.208
Now people put posters up?

01:04:53.583 --> 01:04:55.500
I mean, I don't know which one.

01:04:55.833 --> 01:04:56.875
Rain!

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.042
Aw, this is hopeless.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.000
What's in it? Tell me now.

01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:08.958
You will tell me now, or
you will pay, dear Rain.

01:05:09.167 --> 01:05:11.000
Arr. Never!

01:05:11.542 --> 01:05:14.583
- Oh, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:05:15.833 --> 01:05:18.667
- I think you will.
- Well, think again.

01:05:19.042 --> 01:05:20.208
Rogman.

01:05:22.458 --> 01:05:23.458
Shen Tu!

01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:26.208
How'd you fit in there, big boy?

01:05:26.917 --> 01:05:28.167
That's Guardian big boy.

01:05:30.292 --> 01:05:31.542
Go take a bath.

01:05:38.333 --> 01:05:39.375
Help!

01:05:42.792 --> 01:05:44.208
Help me!

01:05:45.792 --> 01:05:49.208
I knew you'd come. I was
sure you'd save me again.

01:05:49.333 --> 01:05:52.708
Rain, I'm just a humble...
Of course, I would.

01:05:56.042 --> 01:05:57.042
Oh!

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.583
It's Yu Lei.

01:06:00.708 --> 01:06:03.417
Let's go! I feel like I
could jog a whole mile.

01:06:06.458 --> 01:06:08.458
Enough mind games, where
is the third seal?

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:13.542
The Nian is an ancient
and wise being.

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:16.083
It has been watching
you for a long time,

01:06:16.208 --> 01:06:18.583
and has been closer to
you than you realize.

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:23.000
Even with most of its power sealed
away, it has guided you here.

01:06:23.167 --> 01:06:24.792
Just as it's guided me.

01:06:25.333 --> 01:06:27.792
Now, it's giving
you this chance.

01:06:28.125 --> 01:06:30.125
Isn't this what you've wanted?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Yes.

01:06:34.167 --> 01:06:35.167
Mmm.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:39.250
If that's the case,
Yu Lei, go ahead.

01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:41.583
The seal is right here!

01:06:46.167 --> 01:06:48.917
<i>Yu Lei finally realized
the devastating effect</i>

01:06:49.083 --> 01:06:51.083
<i>of all the destruction
he caused.</i>

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:55.500
<i>With each seal broken, he lost
part of the Spirit within himself.</i>

01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:12.333
We're here. Let's go.

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:26.917
Ah... go home. Go home, Yu Lei.

01:07:27.208 --> 01:07:29.292
You're just like your
cookie-eating brother.

01:07:29.583 --> 01:07:32.792
Without him dragging you
down all these years,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.250
who knows what you might
have accomplished.

01:07:54.708 --> 01:07:57.208
What are you waiting for?
Finish it.

01:08:01.167 --> 01:08:03.917
- Yu Lei! Don't do it!
- Yu Lei!

01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:08.708
Wha!

01:08:09.292 --> 01:08:10.458
Please listen to me.

01:08:10.792 --> 01:08:13.250
What you're doing, it won't
bring back the past.

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:15.542
But I was wrong, too!

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.207
The world does need
Guardians like us.

01:08:18.457 --> 01:08:19.875
Rain needs you.

01:08:20.125 --> 01:08:21.250
I need you.

01:08:21.917 --> 01:08:23.875
Please come back to us, brother.

01:08:26.082 --> 01:08:27.082
But...

01:08:27.457 --> 01:08:29.250
What about the final seal?

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:32.000
You were right about me.

01:08:32.917 --> 01:08:35.082
I don't have what it
takes to break the seal.

01:08:35.417 --> 01:08:37.457
I've been so blind and selfish.

01:08:38.292 --> 01:08:40.667
What kind of Guardian
Spirit acts like that?

01:08:46.042 --> 01:08:47.042
Huh?

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:57.332
- Oh, Yu Lei, don't forget your sword.
- Huh?

01:08:58.375 --> 01:08:59.875
Shen Tu, what have you done?

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:10.417
- Run!
- Woah!

01:09:10.582 --> 01:09:12.332
The third seal is broken!

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.125
Welcome the Nian!

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.875
What is happening?

01:09:31.582 --> 01:09:32.832
What is that?

01:09:33.625 --> 01:09:36.667
Yu Lei, you gave this
to me for protection.

01:09:37.875 --> 01:09:39.625
Now, you need it.

01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:55.792
Rain.

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:04.250
Oh.

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:13.833
Guys.

01:10:14.208 --> 01:10:15.708
Guys? Rain?

01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:17.208
Yu Lei?

01:10:17.792 --> 01:10:19.583
Guys. Oh, no.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:21.250
Hm?

01:10:22.708 --> 01:10:23.875
What's that?

01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:29.500
It's our home! It's our home!

01:10:38.542 --> 01:10:39.625
Rain!

01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:43.792
Rain! What happened?

01:10:48.667 --> 01:10:50.167
I'll fix this, I promise.

01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:53.000
No!

01:11:08.292 --> 01:11:11.375
Shen Tu! I'll take you to

01:11:13.083 --> 01:11:14.292
What the...

01:11:24.625 --> 01:11:27.208
Hey, boss, gotta go, now!

01:11:29.542 --> 01:11:30.625
Wait!

01:11:34.417 --> 01:11:36.292
Unhand him, you fiend!

01:11:59.125 --> 01:12:02.667
Come on, inside.

01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:05.417
- Mom?
- I've got you, Rain.

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:08.167
I won't let anything
bad happen to you.

01:12:18.542 --> 01:12:21.708
- Mom, it's scared of the fireworks.
- Huh?

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:27.292
Everyone, listen up.
Go get your fireworks.

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:34.542
Come on!

01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:45.500
Hey, Nian, you want
a piece of me?

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:46.792
Oh, boy.

01:12:49.083 --> 01:12:51.417
Save yourself, go on without me.

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:02.958
Goodbye, cruel world!

01:13:08.542 --> 01:13:09.583
Sorry about that.

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:11.500
Get off me.

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:12.875
Get back!

01:13:14.833 --> 01:13:17.208
Excuse me, flying babies.
We could use your help.

01:13:17.583 --> 01:13:20.125
- We're called mighty babies, OK?
- Get down, guys.

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:25.333
- Well?
- We're in.

01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:39.458
Uh. Maybe we should call
some reinforcements?

01:13:46.458 --> 01:13:47.750
I've created this monster.

01:13:48.917 --> 01:13:52.250
I thought what I was doing
was right, but I was wrong.

01:13:54.042 --> 01:13:57.125
No, Yu Lei, it's not your fault.
It was the Nian.

01:13:57.292 --> 01:13:58.958
He controlled you
from the start.

01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:02.042
We still have a chance
to make this right.

01:14:02.333 --> 01:14:06.208
Whatever I've done wrong, I'm...
I'm still a protector.

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.000
A Guardian Spirit.

01:14:10.125 --> 01:14:12.083
The cavalry is here!

01:14:12.292 --> 01:14:14.625
In your face, literally!

01:14:15.542 --> 01:14:17.667
Eat fireworks, tree man.

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:26.750
Oh, yeah. Good job, guys.
Mighty babies did it again!

01:14:33.542 --> 01:14:34.958
Yu Lei, look!

01:14:36.375 --> 01:14:37.375
Huh?

01:14:40.708 --> 01:14:43.625
The rock! It's the
heart of the Nian!

01:14:53.958 --> 01:14:55.208
Stupid tree!

01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:04.917
I got a plan.

01:15:05.917 --> 01:15:08.250
Hm. You think you can keep up?

01:15:08.917 --> 01:15:11.208
With you and your brittle
hips, no problem.

01:15:11.542 --> 01:15:15.000
If we can get to that rock, we
can destroy the Nian forever.

01:15:15.417 --> 01:15:16.625
A little bit right.

01:15:17.292 --> 01:15:18.333
A little bit left.

01:15:19.125 --> 01:15:20.833
A little more. A little more.

01:15:20.958 --> 01:15:22.000
Stop!

01:15:27.167 --> 01:15:28.167
Set!

01:15:28.333 --> 01:15:29.375
Blast off!

01:15:30.417 --> 01:15:34.375
Surf's up! Mighty
brothers to the rescue!

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:03.792
Oh!

01:16:35.208 --> 01:16:36.417
Shen Tu!

01:16:38.083 --> 01:16:39.292
Shen Tu!

01:16:40.292 --> 01:16:41.292
Now!

01:16:41.917 --> 01:16:43.000
Do it!

01:16:54.792 --> 01:16:56.625
Oh, no. It's coming right at us.

01:17:11.458 --> 01:17:14.042
Wait. Rain's music box. Ha!

01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:26.125
What?

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:28.417
Yu Lei!

01:17:41.583 --> 01:17:42.667
Yes!

01:17:43.542 --> 01:17:45.000
Yeah, they did it!

01:17:45.958 --> 01:17:47.167
They did it!

01:17:53.917 --> 01:17:55.583
Oh, wow! The cloud...

01:18:21.708 --> 01:18:22.792
Yu Lei?

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:32.893
Yu Lei!

01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:47.125
Hey, boss! Spirit World
to Dean, wake up!

01:18:47.625 --> 01:18:50.375
We slayed the mighty giant.
Wake up!

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:51.875
Come on, boss.

01:18:53.875 --> 01:18:56.125
- He's alive!
- Yeah!

01:18:56.708 --> 01:18:58.500
Someone's got to tell
him about the Tuk Tuk.

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.458
<i>With the Nian defeated,</i>

01:19:00.833 --> 01:19:03.167
<i>the Guardian brothers were
able to focus their attention</i>

01:19:03.292 --> 01:19:05.250
<i>on something a little
more creative.</i>

01:19:05.583 --> 01:19:08.708
<i>Namely, a restaurant
for the Spirit world.</i>

01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:09.958
Orders up.

01:19:11.417 --> 01:19:14.500
Hey, Beckett. How's the
new gig treating you?

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:17.042
I still don't have
to wear pants.

01:19:17.333 --> 01:19:18.833
<i>Shen Tu worked the kitchen.</i>

01:19:18.958 --> 01:19:21.917
Hey, Yu Lei! This food's
not gonna serve itself.

01:19:22.083 --> 01:19:24.542
<i>And Yu Lei served the customers,</i>

01:19:24.667 --> 01:19:27.292
<i>who were occasionally difficult.</i>

01:19:27.458 --> 01:19:29.167
<i>But he never needed his sword.</i>

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:33.500
- Woah!
- Woah!

01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:42.500
Hey, beat it!

01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:44.250
If you know what's good for you.

01:19:44.625 --> 01:19:47.458
<i>The brothers rarely
visited the soup shop.</i>

01:19:48.542 --> 01:19:52.375
<i>But knowing they had protectors
up there watching over them</i>

01:19:52.542 --> 01:19:56.375
<i>made the Humans feel just
a little bit stronger,</i>

01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.000
<i>and happier.</i>

01:20:01.542 --> 01:20:03.583
Look, Rain. They
fixed the stove.

01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:06.750
