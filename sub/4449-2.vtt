HAD DANIEL,

12:21.949 --> 12:25.018
BUT I'M SPENDING ALL MY TIME
IN JUAREZ FIGHTING THE FIGHT,

12:25.052 --> 12:28.655
AND ONE DAY, I NEARLY GET LIT UP
IN THIS RAID, DUDE.

12:28.689 --> 12:30.057
I FREAK OUT.

12:30.090 --> 12:33.360
SAME NIGHT, I GO TO CASSIE,
I TELL HER I'M TOXIC GOODS.

12:33.393 --> 12:34.661
I DON'T WANT MY SON
GETTING TO KNOW ME

12:34.695 --> 12:36.096
ONLY TO HAVE ME KILLED
THE NEXT DAY.

12:36.330 --> 12:39.032
- SO YOU LEFT.
- FOR THE BEST.

12:39.066 --> 12:40.734
EXCEPT IT WASN'T.

12:40.767 --> 12:43.036
AND JUST AS I'M REALIZING
I REALLY WANT TO BE A FATHER

12:43.070 --> 12:44.371
TO THIS KID, YOU KNOW,

12:44.404 --> 12:46.373
I HEAR SHE'S TAKING HIM
OUT TO CALIFORNIA.

12:46.406 --> 12:48.809
- OKAY, SO YOU MOVED
INTO GRACELAND TO BE WITH HER.

12:48.842 --> 12:52.446
- BUT THE JOB, JOHNNY--
THE JOB'S STILL THE JOB.

12:52.479 --> 12:56.683
SO I NEED TO REMOVE MYSELF
FROM THE TOXIC ENVIRONMENT,

12:56.717 --> 12:59.453
PUT IN FOR A DESK,
MAKE A HOME CASSIE APPROVES OF

12:59.486 --> 13:01.021
SO I CAN SPEND TIME
WITH DANIEL.

13:01.054 --> 13:02.723
LITTLE MAN
NEEDS TO KNOW HIS POPS.

13:02.756 --> 13:05.092
- YEAH.

13:05.325 --> 13:07.361
- KEEP YOUR TRAP SHUT
UNTIL I'M OUT.

13:07.394 --> 13:09.329
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH, YEAH.

13:09.363 --> 13:11.064
- HEY, LOOK AT ME.
I'M NOT PLAYING, MAN.

13:11.098 --> 13:14.368
I DON'T NEED NO "BLAH, BLAH,
JAKESY, DON'T LEAVE," OKAY?

13:14.401 --> 13:15.902
- OKAY.

13:15.936 --> 13:19.006
- AND THIS STAYS PRIVATE.

13:19.039 --> 13:21.508
- YEAH.
MY WORD.

13:21.541 --> 13:23.510
- OKAY.

13:25.679 --> 13:29.683
- DAMN, SON, SO IS THIS, LIKE...
LIKE, GOOD-BYE?

13:29.716 --> 13:32.452
- GOOD-BYE, JOHNNY.

13:32.486 --> 13:34.588
- YOU WANT A HUG?
- NO, JOHNNY.

13:34.621 --> 13:36.857
NO HUGGING, JOHNNY.
AH.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.061
[cell phone vibrates]

13:41.094 --> 13:42.362
- HEY, MIKEY,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

13:42.396 --> 13:43.597
- BRIGGS, YOU OKAY?

13:43.630 --> 13:45.532
- I MET WITH ALFREDO ARMAS.

13:45.565 --> 13:48.035
THE GUY COOKED ME GOAT STEW,
JUST ME AND HIM.

13:48.068 --> 13:50.771
- HOLY SH--.
YOU GOT TO THE BOSS HIMSELF?

13:50.804 --> 13:52.673
- IS THAT HIM?

13:52.706 --> 13:54.341
- IS THAT CHARLIE?

13:54.374 --> 13:55.742
- SHE KNOWS.

13:55.776 --> 13:57.511
- PUT HER ON.
LET ME HOLLER AT HER.

13:57.544 --> 13:59.413
[door slams]
- SHE'S GONE.

13:59.446 --> 14:01.081
- YEAH, I HEARD THAT.

14:01.314 --> 14:04.384
IS THE DOOR STILL ON ITS HINGES?
- MORE OR LESS.

14:10.731 --> 14:13.326
NO, I UNDERSTAND.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE VIDEO.

14:13.326 --> 14:17.030
I'M WAITING ON SOME
AUDIO-ENHANCING THING.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.765
WELL, CAN YOU MOVE IT UP
IN THE QUEUE?

14:18.799 --> 14:20.500
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO APPROVED MY TRANSFER

14:20.534 --> 14:21.802
OVER TO WARREN'S OPERATION,

14:21.835 --> 14:25.439
SO I WOULD ASSUME THAT
YOU UNDERSTAND THE ONGOING--

14:25.472 --> 14:28.542
[click, beeping]
EH, HELLO?

14:28.575 --> 14:30.610
GOD DAMN IT.
- I CAN COME BACK.

14:30.644 --> 14:33.580
- DON'T COME BACK.
I MEAN, DON'T--DON'T GO.

14:33.613 --> 14:35.615
WHAT?

14:35.649 --> 14:38.652
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

14:38.685 --> 14:40.087
THE PROBLEM IS THIS--

14:40.320 --> 14:42.322
I-I HAVE SPENT THE PAST
FOUR MONTHS OF MY LIFE

14:42.355 --> 14:44.091
TRYING TO TAKE DOWN
THIS N-BOMB LAB,

14:44.324 --> 14:45.959
AND I'M THIS CLOSE
TO TAKING IT DOWN.

14:45.992 --> 14:47.661
- SO DO IT.

14:47.694 --> 14:49.596
- WELL, I'VE GOT THIS GUY,
BENNY MORENO, ON THE HOOK

14:49.629 --> 14:51.465
TO BUY MY PARTNER'S
BENZYL CYANIDE,

14:51.498 --> 14:52.999
BUT I-I CAN'T RUSH IT.

14:53.033 --> 14:54.935
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
JUST HAND IT OFF.

14:54.968 --> 14:57.003
- IT'S MINE, MIKE.

14:57.037 --> 15:01.808
I CAN'T DO THAT,
AND YOU KNOW I CAN'T.

15:01.842 --> 15:04.077
- LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

15:08.815 --> 15:09.950
- THIS IS FINCH.

15:09.983 --> 15:11.785
I THINK HE'S SETTING UP
A MEET WITH MORENO,

15:11.818 --> 15:12.919
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHEN.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.454
THE AUDIO IS BAD.

15:14.488 --> 15:15.689
- YOU CAN'T PULL ANY OF IT?

15:15.722 --> 15:17.691
- NOT WITH THE TOYS
THAT I'VE GOT.

15:17.724 --> 15:19.993
YOU FBI GUYS
GET ALL THE GOODIES,

15:20.026 --> 15:22.462
SO I AM SH-- OUT OF LUCK.

15:22.496 --> 15:23.497
- YOU MAD AT ME?

15:23.530 --> 15:25.966
- NO, I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.
JUST...

15:25.999 --> 15:27.467
YOU SHOW UP,

15:27.501 --> 15:29.903
AND SUDDENLY I'M YANKED
90 DEGREES INTO YOUR STUFF,

15:29.936 --> 15:31.571
AND I'M JUST...

15:31.605 --> 15:34.708
I'M NOT READY.

15:34.741 --> 15:37.677
SO, YEAH, I AM MAD AT YOU.
- [chuckles]

15:37.711 --> 15:39.646
I'M SORRY.
JUST GIVE ME A COPY OF THIS--

15:39.679 --> 15:40.914
- NO, IT'S ALL GOOD.
I GOT IT.

15:40.947 --> 15:42.949
- PAIGE.
- NO, I--

15:42.983 --> 15:45.485
YOU GO DO YOUR STUFF.
I'LL DO MINE.

15:45.519 --> 15:47.053
I--IT'S ALL GOOD.
I-I GOT IT.

15:47.087 --> 15:49.623
IT'S ALL GOOD.

16:00.433 --> 16:01.601
[siren wailing]

16:01.635 --> 16:03.103
- I GOT TO SAY,
I DIDN'T CARE FOR IT.

16:03.336 --> 16:06.072
- IT'S A CLASSIC MOVIE.
- IT'S ALIENATING.

16:06.106 --> 16:08.308
- "ALIENATING"?
- YEAH, IT MEANS THAT--

16:08.341 --> 16:09.476
- I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

16:09.509 --> 16:11.311
- WHAT?
I CAN'T USE BIG WORDS?

16:11.344 --> 16:13.046
IT'S A DUMB-ASS
STUPID MOVIE, YO.

16:13.079 --> 16:15.048
THAT BETTER?
AH!

16:15.081 --> 16:16.650
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

16:16.683 --> 16:18.385
I LIKE THE MOVIE, ALL RIGHT?

16:18.418 --> 16:19.653
DAMN.

16:19.686 --> 16:20.720
DID YOU HIT AN ARTERY
OR SOMETHING?

16:20.754 --> 16:21.888
- YOU'RE FINE.

16:21.922 --> 16:23.523
YOU WERE STABBED FIVE TIMES.
YOU'LL LIVE.

16:23.557 --> 16:26.526
SONYA, GIVE THIS MAN A TAMPON
AND--I DON'T KNOW--

16:26.560 --> 16:27.828
HOLD HIS HAND.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.599
YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.

16:32.632 --> 16:35.635
- HE'S GONNA HELP US.
- WHO'S HE?

16:35.669 --> 16:38.839
- ALFREDO ARMAS.
I MET THE MAN HIMSELF.

16:38.872 --> 16:40.006
- YOU DIDN'T.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.676
- I KIND OF DID.

16:42.709 --> 16:45.378
- WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING
WITH ALFREDO ARMAS?

16:45.412 --> 16:48.048
- WELL, WE ATE A GOAT,
SMOKED SOME BBMFs.

16:48.081 --> 16:49.482
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

16:49.516 --> 16:51.017
THERE WAS NO REASON
FOR YOU TO GO DOWN THERE,

16:51.051 --> 16:52.719
NO REASON.

16:52.752 --> 16:55.021
THERE'S A HUNDRED DIFFERENT WAYS
THAT YOU COULD I.D. MIKE'S GUYS.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.390
- THERE'S NO TIME, CHUCK.
WE'RE AT A DEAD END.

16:57.424 --> 16:58.692
- BULLSH--.

16:58.725 --> 17:00.327
YOU WERE TRYING TO PUT
YOUR ASS BACK IN A SNAKE PIT

17:00.360 --> 17:01.962
SO YOU COULD HAVE A DO-OVER.

17:01.995 --> 17:03.930
- CHARLIE, THIS THING
MIKEY'S GOT GOING

17:03.964 --> 17:05.899
IS GOOD FOR ALL OF US, OKAY?

17:05.932 --> 17:07.767
AFTER THAT SH--STORM
WE WENT THROUGH,

17:07.801 --> 17:09.336
THIS IS WHAT WE NEED, BABE.

17:09.369 --> 17:12.806
THIS COULD PUT US RIGHT BACK
WHERE WE NEED TO BE.

17:12.839 --> 17:16.743
- BUT YOU SET UP A MEET
WITH CAZA WITHOUT TELLING ME.

17:16.776 --> 17:19.846
YOU LEFT ME OUT.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.382
- TRUE.
[machine buzzing]

17:22.415 --> 17:25.385
- SO WHAT NOW?

17:25.418 --> 17:27.687
AM I SUPPOSED TO TRUST YOU
WITH MY HEART?

17:27.721 --> 17:30.824
- OH, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT TRUST NOW?

17:30.857 --> 17:33.526
REALLY? YOU?
SNEAKING OUT AT NIGHT,

17:33.560 --> 17:35.362
NOT TELLING ME WHERE YOU'RE
GOING OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

17:35.395 --> 17:36.796
- WHAT AM I DOING?
- YEAH.

17:36.830 --> 17:38.398
- I'M STARTING TO REALIZE
THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING

17:38.431 --> 17:42.335
AS A DO-OVER,
NOT FOR YOU, ME, OR ANYBODY.

17:42.369 --> 17:44.804
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING AT NIGHT?

17:44.838 --> 17:47.040
THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING AT NIGHT.

17:47.073 --> 17:50.744
[machine buzzing]

18:00.654 --> 18:04.424
[telephone rings]

18:04.457 --> 18:05.859
- HELLO?
- IT'S ME.

18:05.892 --> 18:08.028
- YEAH, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE CALLING HERE.

18:08.061 --> 18:09.062
- NO, I KNOW.

18:09.095 --> 18:11.031
JUST CONFIRMING
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

18:11.064 --> 18:12.599
- WE'RE EXPECTING YOU.

18:12.632 --> 18:14.701
- I GOT THE APARTMENT.

18:14.734 --> 18:15.835
THERE'S A ROOM FOR DANIEL.

18:15.869 --> 18:17.470
IT'S GONNA BE
A GOOD THING, CASS.

18:17.504 --> 18:19.339
I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S GONNA BE
GOOD FOR EVERYBODY,

18:19.372 --> 18:20.540
ESPECIALLY OUR SON.

18:20.573 --> 18:22.008
- WE'LL DISCUSS
ALL THAT TOMORROW.

18:22.042 --> 18:24.344
I HAVE TO GO.
- OH, ONE MORE THING.

18:24.377 --> 18:26.746
UM--HELLO?
[phone line clicks, beeps]

18:26.780 --> 18:29.549
[knock at door]

18:36.489 --> 18:37.891
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

18:37.924 --> 18:39.025

18:40.894 --> 18:43.763
YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW YOU

18:43.797 --> 18:46.333
- COME IN.
CLOSE THE DOOR.

18:49.936 --> 18:52.739
HUH?

18:52.772 --> 18:54.841
LOOK, I GOT
HIS SOCCER STUFF HERE.

18:54.874 --> 18:56.776
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S
INTO BASEBALL OR FOOTBALL YET,

18:56.810 --> 18:58.445
BUT I GOT A LITTLE BIT
JUST IN CASE.

18:58.478 --> 19:01.681
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT HIM, BUT I...

19:01.715 --> 19:03.583
I THINK
HE'S GONNA LIKE IT, MAN.

19:03.616 --> 19:05.885
- YEAH, IT'S DOPE.

19:05.919 --> 19:08.521
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:08.555 --> 19:12.025

- HMM.

19:12.058 --> 19:14.995
- YOU ARE LOOKING
AT KELLY BADILLO.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.063
THAT'S JUAN'S BADILLO'S WIFE...

19:17.097 --> 19:19.332
WIDOW.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.401
CHARLIE'S BEEN STAKING HER OUT,
INVESTIGATING HER.

19:21.434 --> 19:23.370
- WHY IS SHE DOING THAT?

19:23.403 --> 19:25.905
THE KEY SWAP CONVINCED EVERYBODY
JANGLES KILLED BADILLO.

19:25.939 --> 19:27.407
- WELL, MAYBE NOT EVERYBODY.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.908
- IF CHARLIE'S DIGGING
INTO THIS...

19:28.942 --> 19:30.343
- YEAH, I KNOW IT'S BAD.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.045
- SO WHAT ARE YOU
COMING TO ME FOR?

19:32.078 --> 19:34.914
WHAT, IS THE NEXT STEP
BURYING CHARLIE IN THE DESERT?

19:34.948 --> 19:36.516
- COME ON, MAN.

19:36.549 --> 19:38.485

19:38.518 --> 19:40.553
YOU GOT A PLAN?

19:40.587 --> 19:42.589
NOW, THAT'S A FIRST.

19:42.622 --> 19:44.691
YOU NEED TO FIND OUT
WHAT SHE'S PLANNING, MAN.

19:44.724 --> 19:46.359
TAKE CARE OF THIS.
GET AHEAD OF IT.

19:46.393 --> 19:50.497
FIND OUT HOW BAD THIS IS.
YOU NEED TO FIND OUT.

19:50.530 --> 19:51.698

YEAH.

20:09.516 --> 20:11.651
- YOU TOOK MY FILE.
- MADE A COPY.

20:11.684 --> 20:13.420
I THOUGHT
YOU'D WANT TO SEE THIS.

20:13.453 --> 20:15.422
- IS THE AUDIO ENHANCED?
- NOT EXACTLY.

20:15.455 --> 20:16.556
[knocks twice]
- THEN WHY AM I HERE?

20:16.589 --> 20:18.691
- HEY, GUYS.
THIS IS TONY AND CHRIS.

20:18.725 --> 20:21.728
- HEY, GLAD WE COULD
HELP YOU GUYS OUT.

20:21.761 --> 20:23.797
CHRIS SAYS,
"IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU."

20:23.830 --> 20:26.833
- THEY'VE ENHANCED YOUR VIDEO.

20:26.866 --> 20:29.803
- AREN'T YOU BRILLIANT?
- YOU GUYS READY?

20:33.940 --> 20:36.643
- "HEY, I HAVE IT, CUZ."

20:40.547 --> 20:43.016
"WE CAN MEET
WHENEVER YOU WANT."

20:50.757 --> 20:52.992
"FINE ASS?
UNDERSTATEMENT."

20:57.831 --> 21:00.500
"BUT I THINK YOU PROBABLY
DON'T NEED TO MEET HER."

21:00.533 --> 21:01.868
- SON OF A BITCH.
I KNEW IT.

21:01.901 --> 21:03.470
- HE'S CUTTING YOU OUT.

21:03.503 --> 21:06.339
- THAT LITTLE SH--.
I'M GOING TO BRAIN HIM.

21:12.946 --> 21:17.317
- "GREAT.

21:27.927 --> 21:30.697
- EXCUSE ME.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

21:34.334 --> 21:36.870

21:36.903 --> 21:39.372
- IS IT TUESDAY OR THURSDAY?

21:48.948 --> 21:50.750
- THE MAN IN THE VIDEO
SAYS TUESDAY.

21:50.783 --> 21:52.785
- ARE YOU SURE?

21:52.819 --> 21:54.387

IT'S TUESDAY.

21:54.420 --> 21:56.089
