00:38.212 --> 00:40.083
Dr. Laura.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.178
Hmm?

01:50.197 --> 01:52.112
Tahir!

02:31.977 --> 02:34.023
Caught the bad guy hours ago.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.330
Hi.

02:36.373 --> 02:39.594
Usually, we go home after that.

02:40.943 --> 02:44.164
Well, my office has
a nicer couch, so...

02:44.207 --> 02:45.861
I thought I'd have
a post-bad guy drink.

02:45.904 --> 02:48.777
Would you care to join me?

02:48.820 --> 02:50.735
I'll take that as a yes.

02:50.779 --> 02:53.260
Costa Rica.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.436
Again.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.267
I wasn't kidding the other day.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.530
Mm-hmm.

03:02.573 --> 03:03.922
I'm serious.

03:03.966 --> 03:05.359
I need a change.

03:05.402 --> 03:08.188
I'm ready for sun and sand

03:08.231 --> 03:12.757
and not facing a new murder
every single day.

03:14.237 --> 03:18.459
I actually found a place
near the beach.

03:19.982 --> 03:22.158
Putting in an offer.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.646
Hello. Is anyone home?

03:33.474 --> 03:35.606
Good.
You're still here.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.608
Jack, the Bahrain office
needs you in MTAC.

03:37.652 --> 03:40.307
Gibbs, you might as well
come along.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.919
A school bus carrying

03:43.962 --> 03:46.095
four ten-year-old girls
and their chaperone

03:46.138 --> 03:47.966
was hijacked
in Helmand Province yesterday.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.620
Bus driver was shot to death.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.622
The rest presumed kidnapped.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.972
-Taliban.
Most likely.

03:54.016 --> 03:56.105
They're not big fansof girls going to school.

03:56.148 --> 03:58.760
Which is why the bus routes
are usually kept secret.

03:58.803 --> 04:01.284
Somehow, the Taliban found out
about this one.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.459
They staged an ambush.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.766
So, what does this
have to do with me?

04:04.809 --> 04:06.507
We believe this was written

04:06.550 --> 04:08.944
by the girls' chaperone
before they were all taken.

04:15.559 --> 04:16.604
Who's the chaperone?

04:16.647 --> 04:18.736
It's Darya, Jack.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.872
Somebody want to fill me in
on this?

04:23.915 --> 04:27.876
When I was a hostage, uh,
in Afghanistan,

04:27.919 --> 04:30.879
Darya was another captive.

04:30.922 --> 04:33.403
A local who they usedas a servant.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.187
She brought mefood, water.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.015
I wouldn't have made it
without her.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.669
-When we pulled Jack out,

04:38.713 --> 04:41.324
Darya stayed behind
to fight the fight.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.978
All right,
we've been told that she began

04:43.021 --> 04:45.067
working with a local
nongovernmental organization,

04:45.110 --> 04:47.896
an aid group helping villages
threatened by the Taliban.

04:47.939 --> 04:49.985
Is the NGO looking for her?

04:50.028 --> 04:51.726
For what it's worth,
I'm not sure

04:51.769 --> 04:54.076
there's much anyone can do,
but...

04:54.119 --> 04:56.296
we just thought
you should at least know.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.601
Thank you.

05:00.256 --> 05:02.911
And there sure as hell is
plenty we can do.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.826
Leon, I know it's not
our jurisdiction...

05:04.869 --> 05:06.218
Jack, slow down.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.568
No, I'm not going to slow down.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.396
When Masahun tortured me,
it was Darya

05:09.439 --> 05:10.832
who nursed me back to health.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.616
I'm not just gonna stand by...

05:12.660 --> 05:14.139
Jack, I already arranged
for transport.

05:14.183 --> 05:15.706
Oh, okay.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.012
You're damn right
we're not gonna stand by.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.013
I was there, too.

05:18.056 --> 05:19.319
You got us jurisdiction.

05:19.362 --> 05:20.581
SECNAV just approved it.

05:20.624 --> 05:21.930
Plane leaves in two hours.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.540
You two gotyour second COVID shots?

05:23.584 --> 05:24.628
Got it.
Yes.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.543
All right. Stay safe.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.992
So, Gibbs didn't
say anything else?

05:41.036 --> 05:42.820
No,
"You got point."

05:42.864 --> 05:44.344
That's better than

05:44.387 --> 05:45.736
"Make sure Torres
feeds Carl."

05:45.780 --> 05:47.085
Who is Carl?

05:47.129 --> 05:49.566
Carl is a fish.

05:49.610 --> 05:52.003
Sloane dropped him off
at my place last night.

05:52.047 --> 05:53.309
What's going on?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.745
Gibbs called about midnight.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.399
He said he didn't want
to wake you.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.488
So... of course, I thought
he was having a stroke.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.316
Or he was being thoughtful.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.796
McGee does have two kids.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.188
You hear yourself?

06:04.189 --> 06:05.277
"Thoughtful."

06:05.321 --> 06:07.018
Skip to the end.
Why do I have point?

06:07.062 --> 06:09.325
Because Gibbs and Sloane
are heading to Afghanistan.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.893
They're tracking down a
school bus of missing girls.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.460
We believe it
was the Taliban.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.636
-Oh, that's rough.
-Anything we can do to help?

06:15.679 --> 06:18.290
Yes. The NSA picked up
an e-mail containing

06:18.334 --> 06:21.206
the exact coordinates
of where this bus was ambushed.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.469
Taliban was tipped off.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.340
NSA able to track the recipient?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.124
No, but we got
the sender.

06:26.168 --> 06:28.605
And I'm sure he knows where
he sent his e-mail to.

06:28.649 --> 06:31.042
Name's Albert Gorsch-- lives
about an hour outside of D.C.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.349
So, an American sent
the girls' location

06:33.393 --> 06:35.003
to the Taliban? Why?

06:35.046 --> 06:36.265
Pick him up and find out?

06:36.308 --> 06:37.658
Be our pleasure.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.316
What's on your mind?

06:46.449 --> 06:48.408
Sloane gave Carl to Torres?

06:48.451 --> 06:50.845
She could be gone for a while.
Someone's got to feed him.

06:50.888 --> 06:53.021
Except she's got
an automatic fish feeder.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.066
I helped her put it in.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.420
Exactly how dangerous
is this situation?

07:09.124 --> 07:10.908
We will be at the
village in two hours.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.736
Oh, no, take us
to the bus first, please.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.825
No, no, no. Bad idea.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.871
We do not want to be
on the road at night.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.525
Taliban.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.962
The bus-- first.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.746
The longer we wait,
the harder it'll be

07:22.790 --> 07:24.269
to find those missing girls.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.839
Don't look at me.

07:29.884 --> 07:33.235
Wow. That's the most you've said
in the last 12 hours.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.629
Don't worry.
I know what you're doing.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.587
What am I doing?

07:37.631 --> 07:40.024
You think that
if you don't push me

07:40.068 --> 07:42.940
I'll realize on my own
that Costa Rica's a mistake

07:42.984 --> 07:44.202
and I'll change my mind.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.334
That what I think?

07:45.377 --> 07:47.771
Yep.

07:47.815 --> 07:50.557
I wasn't the only one
not saying much on that plane.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.123
What were you thinking?

07:52.167 --> 07:53.951
I was thinking about Darya.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.911
You know, she was a teacher

07:56.954 --> 07:58.869
before the Taliban
kidnapped her.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.219
What'd she do after?

08:01.263 --> 08:03.221
Uh, I don't know anything

08:03.265 --> 08:06.311
except for what
that agent told us.

08:06.355 --> 08:10.620
I mean, she used to patch me up

08:10.664 --> 08:13.493
after Masahun would torture me.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.625
I'm sure she meant well,

08:15.669 --> 08:18.976
but they'd torture me
all over again, so...

08:20.195 --> 08:21.936
We tried to
keep in touch.

08:21.979 --> 08:24.373
E-mail and such,
but it got too hard.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.159
You okay being back here again?

08:28.203 --> 08:30.814
Thanks. I'm okay.

08:30.858 --> 08:33.817
I made peace with this place.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.863
That being said, I wouldn't mind

08:35.906 --> 08:39.214
getting the hell out of here
as fast as possible.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.657
What does a fish
actually do?

08:47.701 --> 08:49.790
You can't pet it, right?
You can't play fetch.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.661
Okay, can we stop
talking about the fish?

08:51.705 --> 08:53.054
Oh, not a fan?

08:53.097 --> 08:54.664
Not since my mom
flushed my goldfish

08:54.708 --> 08:56.361
down the toilet
when I was six.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.668
Oh, so Goldie was
your first dead body.

08:58.712 --> 09:01.628
No. Wait, how did
you know her name?

09:01.671 --> 09:04.544
Because all six-year-olds name
their first goldfish Goldie.

09:04.587 --> 09:07.198
Wait, you smell that?

09:07.242 --> 09:09.766
Uh, speaking of dead bodies...

09:20.255 --> 09:22.562
Well, somebody
beat us here.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.305
Are we sure this is
the right guy?

09:27.349 --> 09:29.438
I mean, look at
these posters.

09:29.481 --> 09:32.136
"Save the Amazon."
"The ocean."

09:32.180 --> 09:34.704
Doesn't exactly strike me
as someone who'd be

09:34.748 --> 09:36.227
working with the Taliban.

09:36.271 --> 09:38.142
I don't know. You tell me.

09:38.186 --> 09:39.753
Does this look familiar?

09:39.796 --> 09:41.493
Yeah. I think those are

09:41.537 --> 09:43.539
the GPS coordinates
of the bus route.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.497
Then we got the right guy.

10:01.165 --> 10:02.689
Agents Gibbs, Sloane.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.255
Yes.

10:04.299 --> 10:05.735
I'm Nabi.

10:05.779 --> 10:08.042
-You with the NGO?
-Moroor Amen. Yes.

10:08.085 --> 10:12.002
Uh, I helped run the local camp
with your friend Darya.

10:12.046 --> 10:14.657
As you can see,
all that's left behind is

10:14.701 --> 10:17.312
the children's shoes
and, uh, backpacks.

10:17.355 --> 10:18.966
And, of course...

10:23.579 --> 10:25.712
Darya knew that
the government

10:25.755 --> 10:27.539
would not have
the resources to help.

10:27.583 --> 10:31.326
The, uh, the NGO, Moroor Amen?

10:31.369 --> 10:33.807
That's Arabic for
"safe passage."

10:33.850 --> 10:35.417
Is that what you do?

10:35.460 --> 10:37.680
Arrange safe passage for girls
who want to go to school?

10:37.724 --> 10:40.727
As well as food, clothing,
COVID vaccinations.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.250
But it is difficult.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.818
The villages are under
constant threat by the Taliban.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.428
Yeah, got that.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.821
Our bus routes are kept secret.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.257
I cannot imagine
who leaked this one.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.868
We might have an idea.
Our team

10:51.912 --> 10:54.001
in D.C. sent us
this photo an hour ago.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.393
You know him?

10:55.437 --> 10:57.439
Yes. Albert. Um...

10:57.482 --> 11:00.094
he helped design Moroor
Amen's internal network.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.880
Are you saying that Albert
hacked into our system

11:03.924 --> 11:05.708
and leaked this
bus's route?

11:05.752 --> 11:06.840
Why?

11:06.883 --> 11:09.407
Can't ask him. He's dead.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.020
Then we shall never know
who has taken the girls.

11:13.063 --> 11:14.412
Well, maybe not,

11:14.456 --> 11:16.371
but we know which way they went.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.546
How?

11:17.589 --> 11:20.636
-Seen this before.
-The Taliban

11:20.680 --> 11:22.507
had them take off
their shoes for a reason.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.684
Makes it harder for them
to get away.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.773
But only if they were headed...

11:26.816 --> 11:28.992
into rough terrain.

11:29.036 --> 11:31.081
Mountains are this way.
That's where we'll start.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.343
Not tonight.

11:32.387 --> 11:33.997
The Taliban soldiers
like to shoot

11:34.041 --> 11:35.651
at passing vehicles at night
for sport.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.131
We should go
to the village.

11:37.174 --> 11:40.003
No, with all due respect,
we should stop wasting time.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.439
Listen to him, Jack.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.050
He's right.

11:43.093 --> 11:47.054
Gibbs, you know every second
those girls are missing...

11:47.097 --> 11:48.751
We can't help them if we're
dead on the side of the road.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.579
We go to the village.
We call Vance.

11:50.622 --> 11:53.060
We get backup.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.975
Take it from there, right?

12:04.636 --> 12:06.116
Jimmy, what do you got?

12:06.160 --> 12:08.423
Kidney failure.
I mean, we-we don't

12:08.466 --> 12:09.685
have kidney failure.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.426
This guy's kidneys,
though, are...

12:11.469 --> 12:13.602
Well, kidney failure
didn't bash in this guy's door.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.082
That would be impressive.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.605
So, was this a murder or...?

12:16.648 --> 12:19.434
He appears to have died
from prerenal kidney failure.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.436
His medical records
show no history

12:21.479 --> 12:23.612
of any kidney
problems, so...

12:23.655 --> 12:24.656
Which means?

12:24.700 --> 12:26.789
It's weird.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.443
That's your official report?

12:28.486 --> 12:31.446
That is all I have until Kasie
gets back with blood results.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.274
I mean, if this was a murder,

12:33.317 --> 12:34.579
we don't even know
what the motive was.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.059
It's got to be one of
the four Ls, right?

12:36.103 --> 12:37.974
Like lust, love, loathing, loot.

12:38.018 --> 12:39.454
And still no clue
who he e-mailed

12:39.497 --> 12:40.934
the kidnapped girls'
bus route to.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.501
Didn't you get, like,
a mountain of his computers?

12:43.545 --> 12:45.025
Can't you just trace his e-mail?

12:45.068 --> 12:47.288
We would, if I could get
into the computers.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.116
I've never seen this kind
of encryption before.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.552
Which means?

12:50.595 --> 12:51.945
It's weird.

13:13.705 --> 13:14.837
These people have nothing.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.187
And to lose their kids, too...

13:18.623 --> 13:20.625
Moroor Amen
operates out of here.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.845
You can contact
your director inside.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.107
What's the perimeter?

13:24.151 --> 13:25.848
Uh, what?

13:25.892 --> 13:27.850
Security. What do you got?

13:27.894 --> 13:29.852
A few men patrol
with rifles.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.724
We have some old land mines
from an abandoned military post.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.552
We keep it in a shed.

13:34.596 --> 13:37.642
Well, I guess the shed's safe.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.953
-Sitrep.
We got a lead on the girls.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.347
Need satellite access
for recon later.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.871
And troops to back us up
if we find something.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.177
I'll do what I can.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.396
But with reduced U.S. presence
in-country,

13:52.440 --> 13:53.963
I'll need to call in
a few favors.

13:54.007 --> 13:56.661
-Well, start calling, please.
In the meantime,

13:56.705 --> 13:58.489
Trip wire perimeter

13:58.533 --> 14:00.622
on the road
leading into town.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.276
Used some old blasting caps.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.887
I voted for the entire
land mine, but whatever.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.890
Jack, you sure you're okay?

14:07.934 --> 14:10.980
I'm fine, Leon.
I just wish everyone would stop

14:11.024 --> 14:12.373
expecting me to fall apart

14:12.416 --> 14:13.591
and let me do my...

14:13.635 --> 14:15.158
Lights! I got the door.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.812
Window.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.042
I got something.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.435
It's Tahir! Tahir!

14:31.479 --> 14:33.394
Stand down, Jack.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.527
Come on.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.533
This is Yazmin,

14:42.577 --> 14:43.970
one of the missing girls.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.189
Hey, Yazmin.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.061
It's okay, angel.
It's okay.

14:49.758 --> 14:51.064
Drink, angel.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.240
You're safe now.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.937
And you're a very brave girl

14:54.981 --> 14:57.200
-for getting away from those men.
-No.

14:57.244 --> 15:01.074
I-I not get away.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.558
They let me go.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.647
They let you go?

15:29.667 --> 15:30.625
Yazmin!

15:30.668 --> 15:31.931
Mama!

15:42.289 --> 15:43.986
I don't get it.
Why'd they let her go?

15:44.030 --> 15:47.076
They could be testing
the perimeter.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.645
Or using her as
a distraction.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.212
She found her way here.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.866
Which means she might know
where the other girls are.

15:56.477 --> 15:59.001
You have a map? Thanks.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.481
Translate for me, please?

16:00.524 --> 16:02.048
-Yes.
-Thank you.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.006
Hey, Yazmin.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.878
-I'm Jack. I'm a friend.
Yazmin.

16:09.229 --> 16:10.970
This is a map.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.710
This is where we are.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.886
Do you know where
those men took you?

16:19.674 --> 16:21.197
It's okay. It's okay.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.332
Acute stress disorder,

16:25.375 --> 16:28.335
possible dissociative amnesia,
would be my guess.

16:28.378 --> 16:29.771
Needs rest.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.991
I can't imagine
what they might've done to her.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.647
Actually, I-I can.

16:36.691 --> 16:39.607
Listen, I can't wait until dawn
to get back out there, Gibbs.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.087
We got to be smart.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.566
Agent Gibbs, Agent Sloane.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.481
-Quickly.
-What is it?

16:44.525 --> 16:46.353
This just appeared online.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.490
They wear those dresses
to school?

16:53.534 --> 16:54.578
No.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.848
Gibbs, that's Darya.
She's alive.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.242
Wait,
what's she reading?

17:06.286 --> 17:07.939
A bank account number.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.506
It's an auction.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.511
The girls are for sale?

17:14.555 --> 17:16.687
Now I know why
they let Yazmin go.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.080
Why?

17:18.124 --> 17:20.126
She has epilepsy.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.868
Many hold outdated superstitions
about it.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.001
Some even consider it
a curse.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.265
They did not think
she was even worth selling.

17:32.921 --> 17:34.575
Those aren't traditional
bank account numbers.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.838
They're for
a cryptocurrency wallet.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.666
That means
we can't trace the owner.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.059
Can we block the bank account?

17:40.102 --> 17:41.016
Buy Vance some time

17:41.060 --> 17:42.278
to get Gibbs that backup.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.584
Backup for what?
I mean, we still don't know

17:43.627 --> 17:44.672
where the girls are being held.

17:44.715 --> 17:45.890
I'm working on it.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.066
Come on, McGee.
Even my grandma

17:47.109 --> 17:48.241
would've figured
it out by now.

17:48.284 --> 17:50.243
Who did Albert send
that e-mail to?

17:50.286 --> 17:53.768
Yeah? Your grandmother can crack
512-bit custom-built encryption?

17:53.811 --> 17:55.944
If she can't, I know who might.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.555
Turns out Albo had a
business partner, a guy named

17:58.599 --> 18:02.081
Ben Mitchell. They ran some
animal nonprofit together.

18:03.430 --> 18:04.822
Ben was the IT guy?

18:04.866 --> 18:07.477
Until he ended up in jail
for hacking.

18:07.521 --> 18:08.957
We should talk to this guy.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.654
-Which jail?
-He's out now.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.700
Runs a pet store.
I'll send you the address.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.180
Oh, maybe he can help us
with Carl.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.660
You know, he-he's barely moving
inside his little bowl.

18:16.704 --> 18:17.922
I think he's depressed.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.143
Eh, he looks fine.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.275
Oh, easy for you to say.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.190
If Sloane comes back
to a dead Carl,

18:24.233 --> 18:26.279
I'm next.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.719
Look, the nonprofit
was just a cover.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.590
Officially, if you saw
an animal being abused,

18:33.634 --> 18:35.114
you could use our
app to report them.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.550
Unofficially, we'd
hack the living crap

18:36.593 --> 18:38.073
out of whoever was
doing the abuse.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.814
Felt nice, but...

18:39.857 --> 18:41.207
I ended up
doing some time.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.817
Turns out I am not a fan.

18:42.860 --> 18:45.080
And when I got out,
I went legit.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.603
What about Albert?

18:50.041 --> 18:52.000
Look, you're not gonna
get the guy in trouble.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.262
He's dead.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.177
You want to help us
figure out why?

18:55.221 --> 18:57.136
And help us
find some missing girls?

19:05.535 --> 19:06.884
While I was locked up,

19:06.928 --> 19:09.539
Albie jumped from animals
to fighting corruption.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.672
Started going by the name
Albatross. At least,

19:11.715 --> 19:13.195
that's what his
-groupies called him.
-Wait, wait.

19:13.239 --> 19:16.067
You-You're saying that
Albert Gorsch was the Albatross?

19:16.111 --> 19:19.506
-Who's that?
-He's, like, the most famous
hacktivist of all time.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.856
No wonder I can't get
into this guy's system.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.032
Oh, and you're excited
because that explains

19:24.075 --> 19:25.338
-why you're failing?
-Hey.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.296
The NSA's been after this guy
for years, okay?

19:27.340 --> 19:30.299
For hacki, uh... visiting?

19:30.343 --> 19:32.345
Look, a hacktivist is a hacker

19:32.388 --> 19:34.825
who uses his skills
for the purposes of good.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.218
Yeah. In Albie's case,

19:36.262 --> 19:38.046
he started helping
government whistleblowers.

19:38.089 --> 19:39.482
And pissed off a lot of people.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.049
Yeah. Thing I don't get,
though, is

19:41.092 --> 19:43.356
hacktivists live by a code,

19:43.399 --> 19:45.532
and that definitely doesn't
include child abduction.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.969
He'd been getting
more and more extreme lately.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.318
9/11 truther,

19:49.362 --> 19:50.406
COVID truther.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.929
I'm kind of not shocked to hear

19:51.973 --> 19:53.670
he hooked up
with some really bad apples.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.194
So, you're gonna help us
get into his system?

19:55.237 --> 19:56.673
Find those girls?

19:56.717 --> 19:59.067
Yeah. Of course I'll help.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.288
You're not gonna believe
who our dead guy is.

20:02.331 --> 20:03.854
Didn't we ID
this guy already?

20:03.898 --> 20:04.855
He's the Albatross.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.509
-No!
-Yeah.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.207
I'm just kidding.
I don't know who that is.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.165
He's the most famous hacktivist
of all time.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.342
Oh! Yeah, sorry.
No, I still don't know.

20:13.386 --> 20:15.692
But don't hacktivists,
like, live by a code

20:15.736 --> 20:18.086
that does not involve
child abduction?

20:18.129 --> 20:19.696
Yeah, well,
Albatross's ex-partner

20:19.740 --> 20:21.350
says that he changed his tune.

20:21.394 --> 20:23.744
Does this ex-partner happen
to have the encryption keys

20:23.787 --> 20:26.921
-to Albatross's server,by any chance?
-He did.

20:26.964 --> 20:30.054
Oh! Well, that makes
my news super anticlimactic.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.056
All I did was ID
the cause of death

20:32.100 --> 20:35.538
for our newly turned evil
hacktivist, and it's not pretty.

20:35.582 --> 20:38.237
-He was killed by ketchup?
-What was in the ketchup.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.282
-Someone spiked itwith acetic acid.
-Hmm.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.805
That's what caused
the kidney failure.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.546
Nice work. Did you, uh...

20:43.590 --> 20:45.069
Check for prints,
already find two sets,

20:45.113 --> 20:47.507
and have already ID'd one
as belonging to our victim?

20:47.550 --> 20:49.378
-Mm-hmm.
-How about the other set?

20:49.422 --> 20:50.684
Ooh, I was just about
to run them

20:50.727 --> 20:52.381
and catch a murderer, but...

20:52.425 --> 20:54.340
I bet I can ID
this second set of prints

20:54.383 --> 20:55.732
before you can hack

20:55.776 --> 20:57.734
-into that server.
-You're on.

20:57.778 --> 20:58.996
Okay.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.520
-Ready?
-Mm-hmm.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.086
On "three."Uh-huh.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.958
-Three.
-What?

21:09.398 --> 21:10.399
In.

21:10.443 --> 21:11.444
Already?

21:11.487 --> 21:13.315
Yeah. Just need to execute

21:13.359 --> 21:15.883
the encryption override.

21:21.845 --> 21:24.195
You've been a bad, bad boy.

21:24.239 --> 21:26.110
Uh-oh.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.374
You've been a bad, bad boy.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.332
Uh-oh.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.768
You've been a bad, bad boy.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.814
I think I might have triggered

21:33.857 --> 21:36.425
some kind of
security protocol here.

21:43.693 --> 21:46.827
Special Agent McGee.

21:46.870 --> 21:50.047
Really? Uh, all over? Okay.

21:50.091 --> 21:51.962
Yeah, I'll, uh,
I'll be right up.

21:52.006 --> 21:54.661
Um, the whole network is down.

21:54.704 --> 21:57.316
"Whole" as in ...e entire building.

21:57.359 --> 22:00.362
Yeah, so I'm gonna go fix that,
um, before Gibbs flies back

22:00.406 --> 22:02.233
from Afghanistan
and kills me himself.

22:04.279 --> 22:06.150
Oh, he dead.

22:08.152 --> 22:10.024
You're doing great.

22:13.201 --> 22:16.160
So, the girls were walked
for a half hour.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.814
Then they were put
on a truck and, uh,

22:17.858 --> 22:20.077
driven another
hour to a house.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.601
That's a pretty wide radius.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.342
She doesn't remember
how she got home.

22:23.385 --> 22:25.996
-I'm still working on it.
-Yeah.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.653
Hey, Leon,

22:30.697 --> 22:32.133
where's that satellite recon?

22:32.176 --> 22:33.482
Waiting on an answer, Gibbs,

22:33.526 --> 22:36.180
but I got a hard no
on any troop support.

22:36.224 --> 22:37.921
We still got three girls
out there.

22:37.965 --> 22:39.923
I know. But the rules
of engagement

22:39.967 --> 22:41.272
the Pentagon agreed to forbid...

22:41.316 --> 22:44.493
Rules?
This is the Taliban, Leon.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.147
They don't have rules.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.192
If you and Sloane
try to mount a rescue,

22:48.236 --> 22:51.370
you will be on your own, which
is I why I expressly forbid...

22:51.413 --> 22:52.806
Expressly what?

22:52.849 --> 22:54.155
You're breaking up, Leon.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.070
No, Gibbs,
I most certainly am not.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.941
Can't hear you.

22:57.985 --> 22:59.639
I want you and Sloane...

23:02.468 --> 23:03.991
You got a location?

23:04.034 --> 23:05.253
Yazmin just told us something.

23:05.296 --> 23:06.994
Well, what'd she say?

23:07.037 --> 23:08.561
That halfway to school,
Darya told the bus driver

23:08.604 --> 23:10.127
to take a new route.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.868
Well, they change routes
all the time.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.435
-You read the NGO report.
-Yes.

23:13.479 --> 23:14.871
But look at it again.

23:14.915 --> 23:16.612
The route Darya had
the driver take

23:16.656 --> 23:18.309
was never on the network.

23:18.353 --> 23:20.007
So how did
Albatross get it?

23:23.010 --> 23:24.577
Can't hack something
that's not there.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.405
Darya was
the only person who knew

23:26.448 --> 23:28.058
where that school bus would be.

23:28.102 --> 23:31.235
Which means the only way
the hacker knew it as well...

23:31.279 --> 23:32.672
Is if she told him.

23:46.468 --> 23:47.774
Tracks end here.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.123
Yeah.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.518
Truck must have picked them up.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.520
So which way
did they go?

23:54.563 --> 23:56.652
I can't tell
if that fork

23:56.696 --> 23:59.394
is a dead end or
crosses a river.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.709
She didn't do it, Gibbs.

24:09.752 --> 24:11.362
Darya.

24:13.364 --> 24:16.933
She would never have
leaked that bus route.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.631
She risked everything
to help me.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.633
She would never sell out
her own people.

24:20.676 --> 24:22.983
I know her.

24:23.026 --> 24:24.550
I got something, Jack.

24:25.768 --> 24:26.943
Wait...

24:26.987 --> 24:29.380
That's Darya's.

24:29.424 --> 24:32.558
She-she had it when
we were held-held captive.

24:32.601 --> 24:36.344
She must have left it for me,
s-- to-to show me the way.

24:36.387 --> 24:38.259
Maybe.

24:38.302 --> 24:40.043
Maybe what?

24:41.958 --> 24:43.656
Just wondering
what kind of prisoner

24:43.699 --> 24:45.962
gets to keep their jewelry.

24:46.006 --> 24:47.703
So, w-what? You think it's a...

24:47.747 --> 24:49.966
i-it's a trick
to send us the wrong way?

24:50.010 --> 24:51.577
It's the oldest
play in the book.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.230
Got a captive that doesn't talk,

24:53.274 --> 24:55.929
stick in a buddy in there,
soften them up.

24:58.671 --> 25:01.369
Masahun did it to Vance
with that fake CIA agent.

25:01.412 --> 25:04.851
Jack, this whole thing
may be one big trap.

25:04.894 --> 25:07.244
Your name on the bus.

25:07.288 --> 25:08.419
Masahun...

25:08.463 --> 25:10.030
still got family in the area.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.206
I-I got to tell you,

25:12.249 --> 25:14.600
Costa Rica's looking better
by the second.

25:14.643 --> 25:19.082
Your friend dropped the necklace
going that way, Jack.

25:19.126 --> 25:21.041
Which way are we going?

25:27.787 --> 25:29.092
<i>Damn, Tim, I don't get it.</i>

25:29.136 --> 25:30.267
<i>You're supposed to be
the computer guy.</i>

25:30.311 --> 25:31.747
How did this guy out-hack you?

25:31.791 --> 25:33.096
You know what? This guy
was, like, one of the best

25:33.140 --> 25:34.881
ten hackers in the world, okay?

25:34.924 --> 25:36.447
You think you got problems?

25:36.491 --> 25:39.712
Try checking murder ketchup
fingerprints by hand.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.409
I'm like Amish Columbo
down there.

25:41.452 --> 25:43.280
All right, that should
isolate every computer

25:43.324 --> 25:45.326
that came in contact
with Albatross's virus.

25:46.588 --> 25:47.937
Oh...
Ah.

25:47.981 --> 25:50.592
-McGee in the building.
-Nice.

25:52.725 --> 25:53.769
What's going on?

25:58.078 --> 26:00.297
Those are not
flattering pictures.

26:00.341 --> 26:01.864
Why is this happening? Wh...

26:01.908 --> 26:03.692
I isolated
Albatross's server.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.520
Seriously, why is this
still happening?

26:05.564 --> 26:07.348
Because the attack isn't coming
from Albatross's server.

26:07.391 --> 26:10.699
It's coming from outside
the building. Here, take a look.

26:10.743 --> 26:13.049
When McGee broke into
Albatross's system,

26:13.093 --> 26:14.616
he didn't just trigger a virus.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.313
I triggered a warning beacon.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.533
-To who?
-All of Albatross's
hacker groupies.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.580
Mm-hmm. It was letting them
know his system was compromised.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.103
Looks like one of them
went on the offensive.

26:23.146 --> 26:25.018
And see?

26:25.061 --> 26:27.629
Y'all made fun of me
for keeping my webcam unplugged.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.544
We got to find them
and stop them.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.937
That is not gonna be easy.

26:30.980 --> 26:33.069
These people are pros
at staying hidden.

26:33.113 --> 26:34.418
Then we make them come to us.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.246
How? Stand outside
with a hard drive

26:36.290 --> 26:37.987
going, "Here, hacker, hacker?"

26:38.031 --> 26:39.293
No, but Albatross
and his buddies

26:39.336 --> 26:42.731
are into helping, uh,
whistleblowers, right?

26:42.775 --> 26:44.428
Well, we dangle one
in front of them as bait.

26:44.472 --> 26:46.343
Yeah, but who? I mean, all
of our pictures are plastered

26:46.387 --> 26:49.390
on the Internet with a "do not
trust" sign stamped across them.

26:49.433 --> 26:52.001
You guys, you guys, I don't want
to be alarmist here,

26:52.045 --> 26:53.568
but my coolers
just went out,

26:53.612 --> 26:56.440
and we are gonna be
in a world of hurt if y-you...

26:58.399 --> 26:59.530
What?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.231
Jimmy, my man,

27:04.274 --> 27:05.667
you got to calm down.

27:05.711 --> 27:06.929
Literally the least
calming thing

27:06.973 --> 27:08.539
you could say
to a person.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.672
Okay, maybe we should
go over this again.

27:10.716 --> 27:13.675
You're a janitor who wants
to expose an NCIS cover-up.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.808
Right. And I piggybacked

27:15.851 --> 27:17.766
onto Albatross's
beacon to make contact.

27:17.810 --> 27:20.029
Now I have a USB drive
with the dirt.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.857
Put the USB drive down.

27:21.901 --> 27:24.773
Yeah-- Sorry.
I'm really nervous, okay?

27:24.817 --> 27:27.036
And somehow simultaneously
extremely bored.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.865
This is really what you guys do
on stakeouts?

27:29.909 --> 27:32.302
Terrible for circulation.

27:32.346 --> 27:34.174
Not to mention
I'm really hungry.

27:34.217 --> 27:36.350
You know, maybe
this was a bad idea.

27:36.393 --> 27:37.568
If our guy makes Jimmy,

27:37.612 --> 27:39.005
we're not gonna get
a second chance here.

27:39.048 --> 27:40.789
And not for nothing, but I think

27:40.833 --> 27:43.139
I have eyes on our hacktivist.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.706
Check out the mom
pushing the stroller.

27:44.750 --> 27:47.404
No way. Who brings a
baby to an intel drop?

27:47.448 --> 27:49.842
Who walks a baby
without a diaper bag?

27:49.885 --> 27:53.062
Plus, that mom hasn't looked
down in her stroller once.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.890
-So?
-So if you were pushing around

27:54.934 --> 27:56.849
the cutest living organism
on Planet Earth,

27:56.892 --> 27:59.765
wouldn't you stare at it
every chance you got?

27:59.808 --> 28:01.505
Mm-hmm. Like Baby Yoda.

28:01.549 --> 28:03.246
Now you're getting it.

28:03.290 --> 28:04.247
Move in, Bishop.

28:04.291 --> 28:05.422
Yep. I got it.

28:05.466 --> 28:06.728
Hey. NCIS.

28:06.772 --> 28:07.773
Hey.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.339
NCIS!

28:10.297 --> 28:11.864
Freeze!

28:11.907 --> 28:13.126
Do I-- do I...?

28:19.132 --> 28:21.264
You're welcome.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.918
So...

28:22.962 --> 28:24.441
you got hacked, huh?

28:24.485 --> 28:26.182
What's that got
to do with me?

28:26.226 --> 28:28.271
I think we both know
the answer to that.

28:28.315 --> 28:29.620
Good luck proving it.

28:29.664 --> 28:32.188
I'm trying to solve
your friend's murder.

28:32.232 --> 28:35.844
Should I find it suspicious
that you don't want to help?

28:37.150 --> 28:38.586
His murder.

28:40.327 --> 28:41.850
Right. Sure.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.941
Was this before or after he
collaborated with the Taliban?

28:45.985 --> 28:47.073
After.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.121
You guys got to get
better game.

28:52.165 --> 28:53.688
I don't know
what you got on Albatross,

28:53.732 --> 28:56.517
but no way was he collaborating
with terrorists.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.649
He's one of the good guys.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.782
-And we are?
-The Man.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.088
Deep state.

29:02.131 --> 29:04.264
And I'm not buying
what you're selling.

29:04.307 --> 29:06.353
Far as I'm concerned,
there was

29:06.396 --> 29:08.355
no murder, no kidnapping

29:08.398 --> 29:11.140
and Albatross is sitting
in some black site with...

29:11.184 --> 29:12.533
Three little girls.

29:12.576 --> 29:16.450
Three little girls
being auctioned off like cattle.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.801
Here's your buddy.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.585
This one we can
go see in person

29:21.629 --> 29:23.762
if you want to take a
quick little field trip.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.765
I don't really give a rat's ass
who killed that guy.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.679
Because he sold
those little girls out

29:28.723 --> 29:30.072
on their way
to school.

29:30.116 --> 29:32.379
And those girls are out there,
scared and hurt,

29:32.422 --> 29:35.251
and the only way to find them
is by tracing an e-mail locked

29:35.295 --> 29:36.557
inside of Albatross' system.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.646
Which we can't access
because of your virus.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.737
You said you're one
of the good guys. Prove it.

29:45.522 --> 29:46.697
Okay.

29:46.741 --> 29:48.612
I'll show you
how to unlock your system.

29:48.656 --> 29:50.658
But one thing--
you said

29:50.701 --> 29:52.486
that the NSA flagged his e-mail?

29:52.529 --> 29:53.530
Yeah, that's right.

29:53.574 --> 29:55.358
That I don't believe.

29:55.402 --> 29:57.143
He's been evading them
for years.

29:58.361 --> 30:00.668
He's being set up.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.071
Yeah.

30:12.114 --> 30:14.769
No. We're losing the light,
so we headed back.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.249
Thanks for
the heads-up, McGee.

30:16.292 --> 30:17.816
They track
that e-mail yet?

30:17.859 --> 30:19.948
Uh, no. But, uh,

30:19.992 --> 30:23.256
McGee was able to block
the kidnappers' bank account.

30:23.299 --> 30:25.084
Bought us some time
before they're sold.

30:25.127 --> 30:27.086
-Yeah.
Agent Gibbs!
Agent Sloane!

30:29.044 --> 30:30.524
Wait,
something's wrong, Gibbs.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.007
Oh, my God.

30:35.050 --> 30:36.182
Oh, my God!

30:39.185 --> 30:40.751
Oh, my God.
Darya.

30:40.795 --> 30:43.711
They-they threw her
from a truck.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.278
-They didn'teven slow down.
-Darya.

30:45.321 --> 30:46.932
Did you recognize anyone?

30:46.975 --> 30:50.283
No. But this was
pinned to her coat.

30:57.986 --> 31:01.381
"Go home
or there will be more blood."

31:03.687 --> 31:05.037
It's in English.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.603
It's to us.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.518
So much for this
being a trap.

31:08.562 --> 31:10.259
She wasn't in on it, Gibbs!

31:10.303 --> 31:11.565
Where you going?

31:11.608 --> 31:12.566
I'm done.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.220
What do you mean you're done?!

31:14.263 --> 31:17.353
This is why I want out.

31:17.397 --> 31:18.789
This.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.530
We chase bad guys.

31:20.574 --> 31:22.010
We put them away.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.751
And nothing ever changes.

31:23.794 --> 31:25.100
Except for us.

31:25.144 --> 31:28.974
Darya risked her
life to help me,

31:29.017 --> 31:31.237
and-and we're all so twisted

31:31.280 --> 31:34.849
we couldn't see that basic act
of humanity for what it was.

31:36.503 --> 31:38.113
So call it what you want.

31:38.157 --> 31:40.159
Quitting. Running. I don't care.

31:40.202 --> 31:41.987
I'm out.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.466
I'm done!

32:23.071 --> 32:26.509
Might as well go out
in a blaze of glory, right?

32:28.076 --> 32:29.773
A local thought
he recognized

32:29.817 --> 32:31.688
the truck
that dumped Darya's body.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.995
Said it came from that village.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.041
I thought I'd do a little recon.

32:36.084 --> 32:38.739
Alone? By yourself?

32:40.349 --> 32:42.525
Are you wanting
to get yourself killed?

32:45.485 --> 32:47.139
Seriously?

32:48.270 --> 32:51.099
Why is it
when Leroy Jethro Gibbs

32:51.143 --> 32:53.623
wants to charge in
with guns blazing,

32:53.667 --> 32:55.364
it's heroic,

32:55.408 --> 32:57.671
but when I want to do it,
I have a death wish?

32:57.714 --> 32:59.020
I don't talk like I want to die.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.065
So pick one!

33:00.108 --> 33:01.153
You can't have it
both ways, Gibbs.

33:01.196 --> 33:02.328
What am I picking?

33:02.371 --> 33:03.851
You can't tell me
I'm a fighter

33:03.894 --> 33:05.809
and that fighters never quit,

33:05.853 --> 33:08.725
and then try to ground me
when you don't like my plan.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.640
I can if I want you
to be around.

33:10.684 --> 33:12.164
At NCIS or on the planet?

33:12.207 --> 33:14.079
Both!

33:16.907 --> 33:19.345
Jack, every truck out
there looks the same.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.825
You go charging
into the wrong village

33:21.869 --> 33:23.175
with your ass all on fire,

33:23.218 --> 33:25.786
we will never see
these girls again.

33:27.744 --> 33:29.485
Do you have a better idea?

33:29.529 --> 33:31.052
We call Vance.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.054
We see where
he is on the satellite recon.

33:33.098 --> 33:35.970
If he's nowhere,
then we go check out

33:36.014 --> 33:37.450
the village
-ourselves.
-Fine.

33:37.493 --> 33:38.886
But...

33:38.929 --> 33:41.149
we do that together.

33:43.499 --> 33:44.979
We need to hurry.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.285
I just spoke
to Vance.

33:46.328 --> 33:48.069
He just spoke
to Gibbs and Sloane.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.549
-What's up?
-Well, it sounds like

33:49.592 --> 33:51.377
they're about
to do something very...

33:51.420 --> 33:52.987
Gibbsian and Sloansian.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.815
Okay. So what can we do?

33:54.858 --> 33:56.643
Get intel on whatever
they're about to walk into.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.775
All right.
Albatross's laptop.

33:58.819 --> 34:00.429
Did you find out
who he sent that bus route to?

34:00.473 --> 34:03.432
I didn't have any better luck
tracing his e-mail than the NSA.

34:03.476 --> 34:05.826
That's assuming he was really
the one who sent the e-mail.

34:05.869 --> 34:08.785
Well, Baby Yoda's mom

34:08.829 --> 34:11.005
seems to think that
Albatross was being set up.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.138
Setup or not,
someone kidnapped those girls.

34:13.181 --> 34:15.140
What about focusing
on the murder case?

34:15.183 --> 34:16.532
Shake something
loose.

34:16.576 --> 34:19.144
We still don't have motive,
let alone a solid lead.

34:19.187 --> 34:21.276
Did someone order solid?

34:21.320 --> 34:23.452
'Cause I have got
some solid gold.

34:23.496 --> 34:26.194
My computers are back up--
thank you, Secret Agent Palmer.

34:26.238 --> 34:27.848
And I managed
to ID the prints

34:27.891 --> 34:29.154
on the murder ketchup.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.198
And?

34:30.242 --> 34:32.635
And our murderer is...

34:32.679 --> 34:35.595
You're about as good
at getting away with murder

34:35.638 --> 34:37.031
as you were
at hacking.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.685
And we know
where hacking got you.

34:38.728 --> 34:41.383
I try to help you guys
and this is the thanks I get?

34:41.427 --> 34:43.342
Yeah, this is why
people hate you.

34:43.385 --> 34:45.866
Nobody hates me.
Does anyone hate you, Nick?

34:45.909 --> 34:47.911
Oh, well, I mean,

34:47.955 --> 34:49.174
I did go undercover
for, like, ten years,

34:49.217 --> 34:50.218
so yeah, maybe.

34:50.262 --> 34:51.219
Okay, this isn't funny.

34:51.263 --> 34:52.612
No. You're right.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.570
Nothing about this
is funny, actually.

34:57.921 --> 34:59.619
Your prints on
the murder weapon...

34:59.662 --> 35:00.620
Not funny.

35:00.663 --> 35:01.882
The bottle of poison

35:01.925 --> 35:03.536
that we found in your trash...

35:03.579 --> 35:04.798
Not funny.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.409
You're done.

35:07.453 --> 35:09.933
We know that you killed
your ex-partner.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.500
And the jury's gonna
know it, too.

35:11.544 --> 35:12.806
We just want to know why.

35:12.849 --> 35:14.329
Because he was a sellout.

35:15.504 --> 35:17.071
You know, he was supposed
to be our hero.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.507
Fighting the good fight

35:18.551 --> 35:20.727
when things got a little too hot
for the rest of us.

35:20.770 --> 35:22.076
You were right.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.687
Hacktivists live
by a code,

35:24.731 --> 35:27.560
and it does not include selling
information to terrorists.

35:27.603 --> 35:29.344
Albie started working
for the mob,

35:29.388 --> 35:31.390
dealers,

35:31.433 --> 35:33.174
anyone who would pay.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.393
So you killed him.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.351
No, I--
It was an accident, okay?

35:36.395 --> 35:38.179
That-that was just supposed
to send him to the hospital,

35:38.223 --> 35:39.615
give me time
to access his system

35:39.659 --> 35:41.095
while I unhashed
that e-mail he sent.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.140
What?

35:43.053 --> 35:44.707
You're the one
that set him up.

35:44.751 --> 35:46.318
You unhashed
that encryption

35:46.361 --> 35:47.971
so that NSA
would flag his e-mail.

35:48.015 --> 35:52.193
I... I wanted people
to see what he'd become.

35:52.237 --> 35:54.195
I-I didn't want
to kill anybody.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.066
I mean, who eats
that much ketchup in a week?

35:56.110 --> 35:57.807
And what about the girls?

35:57.851 --> 35:59.940
Did you even think about them?

35:59.983 --> 36:01.376
I got his e-mail flagged!

36:01.420 --> 36:02.638
It's not my fault you idiots
couldn't track the thing

36:02.682 --> 36:04.074
-to the other side.
-Hey.

36:04.118 --> 36:06.207
You want to help us,
tell us everything you know

36:06.251 --> 36:07.339
about the kidnappers.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.689
I don't know anything you don't.

36:09.732 --> 36:13.345
Except maybe who gave Albie that
bus route in the first place.

36:13.388 --> 36:14.694
That we know.

36:14.737 --> 36:17.044
It was Darya,
the woman in charge of the NGO.

36:17.087 --> 36:18.872
Who?

36:18.915 --> 36:20.395
No, it wasn't a woman.

36:21.353 --> 36:23.006
Then who was it?

36:30.405 --> 36:32.233
Agent Gibbs, any news?

36:32.277 --> 36:33.713
Beat it.

36:36.498 --> 36:37.630
Is there a problem?

36:37.673 --> 36:39.414
-Where are the girls?
-Excuse me?

36:39.458 --> 36:41.373
Darya isn't the one
who sold them out.

36:41.416 --> 36:42.548
You are.
She changed

36:42.591 --> 36:43.940
the bus route
at the last minute.

36:43.984 --> 36:45.115
Didn't tell anyone...

36:45.159 --> 36:46.247
...except you.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.336
And then

36:48.380 --> 36:50.251
you told him.

36:53.123 --> 36:54.734
This is absurd.

36:54.777 --> 36:57.258
I'm gonna ask you one more time
where the girls are.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.781
And then I'm gonna leave you
alone with her.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.264
You are an American
federal agent.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.092
You won't hurt me.

37:05.135 --> 37:06.876
Me?

37:06.920 --> 37:09.270
I'm going to Costa Rica, baby.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.794
And you killed my friend.

37:11.838 --> 37:14.667
Darya was like a cancer!

37:16.190 --> 37:20.107
Moroor Amen was only supposed
to supply food and shelter.

37:20.150 --> 37:23.632
Darya wanted to destroy
our entire way of life.

37:23.676 --> 37:27.941
She wanted these girls
to learn English. Math.

37:27.984 --> 37:30.117
It was not right.

37:31.161 --> 37:33.773
You sold those girls
into slavery

37:33.816 --> 37:35.209
so they couldn't learn math?

37:38.995 --> 37:40.910
That was not
supposed to happen.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.347
They were supposed
to be married off

37:42.390 --> 37:44.087
to good husbands, not sold.

37:45.306 --> 37:47.787
But it is a holy war.
It is what it is.

37:50.006 --> 37:51.965
Wait. Where are you going?

37:52.008 --> 37:53.575
She can take it from here.

37:53.619 --> 37:55.708
She is a crazy woman!
She will kill me!

38:00.974 --> 38:03.063
It is what it is.

38:03.106 --> 38:04.543
What? No!

38:04.586 --> 38:08.024
Unless you tell us where
those girls are being held.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.249
Hey!

38:27.043 --> 38:28.218
Building secure!

38:40.274 --> 38:42.320
It's okay.

38:56.856 --> 38:58.466
Hey.

38:58.510 --> 39:00.033
Come on.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.435
Okay, that feels good.

39:10.478 --> 39:12.219
Yeah.

39:19.269 --> 39:21.402
Sir. Ma'am.

39:21.446 --> 39:22.925
Since the CO had to, uh,

39:22.969 --> 39:25.580
creatively interpret a few
rules to okay this mission,

39:25.624 --> 39:27.060
we need to return
to base ASAP.

39:27.103 --> 39:29.584
Please thank your CO for us.
And thank you.

39:31.151 --> 39:32.718
That's all
the thanks I need.

39:32.761 --> 39:35.721
Besides, when the director
of NCIS makes a direct call...

39:35.764 --> 39:38.288
Can always count
on a Marine.
Oorah.

39:38.332 --> 39:40.508
Can we give you two
a lift back to base?

39:41.814 --> 39:44.120
Uh... gonna
need a minute.

39:48.951 --> 39:50.518
So?

39:51.519 --> 39:52.825
Jack?

39:54.130 --> 39:57.046
I think you probably
already know.

39:58.091 --> 40:00.006
You were never
going to Costa Rica.

40:00.049 --> 40:03.531
And you know I'm not going
back with you, either.

40:05.533 --> 40:09.929
Moroor Amen, uh,
they're down a leader.

40:09.972 --> 40:13.019
The town's still vulnerable
to Taliban attacks.

40:17.110 --> 40:20.069
And, hey, I did say
I needed a change...

40:20.113 --> 40:21.941
Not exactly the beach.

40:21.984 --> 40:24.247
But there is sun.
Sand.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.467
Sand.
Lots of sand.

40:27.773 --> 40:28.817
Yeah.

40:30.776 --> 40:34.649
I have loved my time at NCIS.

40:34.693 --> 40:36.956
Been a really good path.

40:36.999 --> 40:39.306
But, um...

40:39.349 --> 40:41.743
you don't need me anymore.

40:43.223 --> 40:44.790
I'm not sure about that.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.966
Come on.

40:47.009 --> 40:49.055
I don't belong behind a desk.

40:49.098 --> 40:50.883
I never did.

40:54.234 --> 40:55.888
And you're right. I was running.

40:55.931 --> 40:58.368
But I don't want
to do that anymore.

40:59.587 --> 41:02.024
I think I can make
a difference here.

41:02.068 --> 41:04.549
I want to make
a difference here.

41:04.592 --> 41:06.812
And I know
you understand that.

41:08.857 --> 41:11.817
I'll call everybody,
when I'm ready.

41:13.209 --> 41:15.342
And as for you...

41:17.866 --> 41:20.652
If you ever want to visit...

41:29.704 --> 41:32.359
Bye, Jack.

41:32.402 --> 41:34.100
Bye, Gibbs.
