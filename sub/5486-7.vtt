07:00.437 --> 07:02.636
- Thank you.
- Oh.

07:02.637 --> 07:04.336
Bye, Clara.
- Bye.

07:04.337 --> 07:06.097
- Bye!
I don't know.

07:06.107 --> 07:07.606
Personally?

07:07.607 --> 07:09.067
Bad vibe.
- She's perfect!

07:09.077 --> 07:10.576
She's responsible, she's pretty,

07:10.577 --> 07:12.146
she's too flat
for Danny to like.

07:12.147 --> 07:13.276
We did it.

07:13.277 --> 07:15.147
[cell phone vibrates]

07:22.057 --> 07:23.496

07:24.497 --> 07:25.257

07:25.258 --> 07:27.417
Hey, you need to talk to me?
- Yes.

07:27.427 --> 07:28.766
It's a most urgent matter.

07:28.767 --> 07:30.096
- Okay.
- Please, do come in.

07:30.097 --> 07:31.366
Take a seat.

07:31.367 --> 07:32.802
May I offer you a refreshment?

07:32.803 --> 07:33.996
- Is this urgent or not?

07:33.997 --> 07:35.327
- No matter is so urgent

07:35.337 --> 07:36.836
there isn't time
for a little civility.

07:36.837 --> 07:39.206
I believe it was
Jefferson Davis who said...

07:39.207 --> 07:41.506
- Oh, my God, every time
you talk, it takes so long

07:41.507 --> 07:43.337
that I literally die
and turn into a skeleton.

07:43.347 --> 07:44.716
So please just tell me
what's going on.

07:44.717 --> 07:46.576
- Right.

07:46.577 --> 07:48.176
Tamra has brought something
to my attention

07:48.177 --> 07:50.707
of the most distressing nature
and...

07:50.717 --> 07:51.786
- I can't.
Tamra, go.

07:51.787 --> 07:52.856
- I saw Dr. Reed's girlfriend

07:52.857 --> 07:54.316
doing cocaine a few weeks ago.

07:54.317 --> 07:54.497
- Thank you, Tamra.
You may go now.

07:54.498 --> 07:56.147
- Thank you, Tamra.
You may go now.

07:56.157 --> 07:58.256
- Thank you.

07:58.257 --> 07:59.956
- God.
- So what are we gonna do?

07:59.957 --> 08:01.556
Jeremy is like
a little brother to me

08:01.557 --> 08:03.087
and his girlfriend
is a cokehead.

08:03.097 --> 08:05.136
- Doing cocaine once doesn't
make someone a cokehead.

08:05.137 --> 08:06.166
Don't jump to conclusions.

08:06.167 --> 08:07.506
I hit a bicyclist once
in my car.

08:07.507 --> 08:09.627
Does it make me a murderer?
I have no idea.

08:09.637 --> 08:11.406
I drove off.
- I can't help it.

08:11.407 --> 08:14.176
I mean, we've known each other
since before we were men.

08:14.177 --> 08:16.606
He taught me to love medicine,

08:16.607 --> 08:18.106

how to stimulate

08:19.747 --> 08:21.256

- Using only his...

08:21.257 --> 08:23.107
- I'm so sorry.
Before I was a working mom,

08:23.117 --> 08:24.507
I would have loved gossip
like this.

08:24.497 --> 08:24.947
I would have loved gossip
like this.

08:24.948 --> 08:27.047
Honestly, we would have talked
about it for, like, three hours.

08:27.057 --> 08:29.526
But I'm extremely busy.
So if you'll exsqueeze me,

08:29.527 --> 08:30.896
I'm going to go answer emails

08:30.897 --> 08:34.155
while I eat a sandwich
on the toilet.

08:34.157 --> 08:37.386
What are you do...
Oh... okay.

It's annoying, isn't it?
Oh, she's gonna hate it.

08:59.357 --> 09:01.316
- No, it was beautiful,

09:01.317 --> 09:03.757
and it makes what I have to say

09:08.157 --> 09:10.587

Oh, man.

09:10.597 --> 09:12.566
Annette, this rigatoni

I wanted to talk to you about.

09:21.813 --> 09:23.967
- Danny found a new woman
in California?

09:26.847 --> 09:28.656
He's probably
still cleaning the screen.

09:28.657 --> 09:31.216
The news is
I found a nanny for Leo.

09:31.217 --> 09:34.177
And just to say thank you
for all that you've done,

09:34.187 --> 09:37.526
I actually bought you

11:12.917 --> 11:15.286
you don't want any legal counsel
here with you?

she's worked close to 100 hours
for you without any pay.

That, my friend,
constitutes slavery

- When I worked,

11:55.097 --> 11:57.232
my boys were always with family.

11:57.233 --> 11:59.327
- Did your family invade
your personal space

11:59.337 --> 12:01.036
and slut-shame
your underwear drawer?

12:01.037 --> 12:03.136
- We didn't have personal space.

12:03.137 --> 12:05.736
I gave Danny his bath
until he was 18.

12:05.737 --> 12:07.797
- Oh, my God.
- We all did.

12:07.807 --> 12:09.476
- What is wrong with you people?

12:09.477 --> 12:10.916
You know what?
I gotta go back to work.

12:10.917 --> 12:12.876
Just send me the bill.
- Okay.

12:12.877 --> 12:15.107
It's gonna include
my legal fees too.

12:15.117 --> 12:17.416
- Whatever.
- Fine! But I hope you're okay

12:17.417 --> 12:19.456
with your baby not having
a grandmother.

12:19.457 --> 12:21.397
- Or a grandmother's friend!

12:26.157 --> 12:28.487
- I did it! Had it out
with Whitney about her drug use.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.966
It's over.
- Ahh!

12:29.967 --> 12:31.666
Jeremy, that is wonderful news.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.136
- Right, the relationship
isn't over,

12:33.137 --> 12:34.502
just the difficult conversation.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.166
No, Whitney and I are perfect.

12:36.167 --> 12:37.366
- Uh, come again?

12:37.367 --> 12:39.467
- Well, I told her
in very strict terms

12:39.477 --> 12:41.376
that I was concerned
about her cocaine use

12:41.377 --> 12:42.816
and she promised she would
keep an eye on it.

12:42.817 --> 12:45.807
- That's it?
She's gonna keep an eye on it?

12:45.817 --> 12:47.586
- Jeremy, are you sure you're
not just being manipulated

12:47.587 --> 12:48.877
by a woman again?

12:48.887 --> 12:50.486
I mean, you paid for your
ex-girlfriend's wedding.

12:50.487 --> 12:51.656
- I didn't pay for the wedding.
I didn't.

12:51.657 --> 12:53.647
I paid for her dress
and his ring.

12:53.657 --> 12:53.997

I'm manipulating Whitney

12:53.998 --> 12:56.056
If anything,

I am so she'll never leave me.

matters into my own hands.

Grandmothers are overrated.

13:17.207 --> 13:19.176
I had no opinion.

They can't drive, they give

a cool, fresh-faced, young woman
to take care of my son

13:41.167 --> 13:43.836
because he deserves a cool,
young nanny

13:46.543 --> 13:48.367
the Chris Pratt version
of "Jurassic Park."

I was raised by my grandmother

13:51.247 --> 13:53.976
and I turned out great.
Oh, God! My wound!

13:53.977 --> 13:53.987
- I'd love to help you, Morgan,

13:53.997 --> 13:55.256
- I'd love to help you, Morgan,

13:55.257 --> 13:57.977
but we never got to the end
of that gauze seminar.

- What's wrong?

14:10.833 --> 14:12.696
More cast shake-ups
on "The View"?

14:12.697 --> 14:14.557

the poster child

14:14.567 --> 14:16.106
for the anti-vaccination
movement.

14:16.107 --> 14:17.372

for a moment of your time?

14:28.253 --> 14:30.707
- I'm sorry. Who are you?
- I'm Jeremy's friend.

14:30.717 --> 14:32.386
I think it would be best
if your relationship

14:32.387 --> 14:33.856
found a natural point
of termination.

14:33.857 --> 14:35.056
- Are you kidding me?

14:35.057 --> 14:36.826
He's the best boyfriend
I've ever had.

14:36.827 --> 14:39.626
After he cooks me dinner,
he gives me a comment card

14:39.627 --> 14:40.996
about how he can improve.

14:40.997 --> 14:44.266
- Very well, I may need to argue
in the language of the city.

14:44.267 --> 14:46.502
- You want to pay me
to break up with him?

14:46.503 --> 14:48.727
What are you, the dad
in a Nicholas Sparks movie?

14:48.737 --> 14:50.506
- All right, enough.
Who do I make the check out to?

14:50.507 --> 14:51.936
You or Pablo Escobar?

15:06.717 --> 15:08.447
- Oh, really?
And he's gonna listen to you?

15:08.457 --> 15:10.256
Some inbred Civil War general

15:10.257 --> 15:12.062
who smells like the woods
after a storm?

15:12.063 --> 15:14.087
- You are out of control.
- And you like it.

15:14.097 --> 15:15.697
- Oh, my God.
I do.

15:22.107 --> 15:23.996
- Clara!
What the hell?

15:23.997 --> 15:24.407
- Clara!
What the hell?

15:24.408 --> 15:27.006
Why would you think it was okay
to take a photo of my son

15:27.007 --> 15:28.442
in an anti-vaccination onesie?

15:28.443 --> 15:30.967
- But I thought you said
you wanted him to be famous.

15:30.977 --> 15:33.416
- Yeah, of course I do.
But if you want him to model,

15:33.417 --> 15:34.886
you gotta go through
his talent agent,

15:34.887 --> 15:37.507
who I don't have because no one
will accept us as a package.

15:37.517 --> 15:39.286
Also, he is vaccinated.

15:39.287 --> 15:41.256
- What?
Why?

15:41.257 --> 15:45.162
Vaccines are just toxins pumped
into our children by Big Pharma!

15:45.163 --> 15:47.087
- No!
You know what Big Pharma did?

15:47.097 --> 15:49.566
They got rid of Big Mumps
and Big Polio.

15:49.567 --> 15:51.606
- Yeah, but no one even
gets those anymore.

15:51.607 --> 15:53.496
- Because of vaccines!

15:53.497 --> 15:53.987
Clara, you gotta go,
which makes me sad

15:53.997 --> 15:55.806
Clara, you gotta go,
which makes me sad

15:55.807 --> 15:57.376
because you were a good nanny,
and frankly,

15:57.377 --> 15:58.967
I thought we would be
great friends.

15:58.977 --> 16:01.276
- I would never be friends
with you.

16:01.277 --> 16:02.976
You're an old lady
like Britney Spears.

16:02.977 --> 16:05.616
- [gasps] How dare you!

16:05.617 --> 16:08.146
Wait! Where are you going?
- You just fired me.

16:08.147 --> 16:09.477
- Yeah, but I meant, like,
fired in a couple hours

16:09.487 --> 16:13.016
when I come back from work.

16:13.017 --> 16:16.747
Oh, no.
Who's gonna watch Leo now?

16:32.837 --> 16:35.406
[whispers]
Leo, that was so good.

16:35.407 --> 16:38.237
No one's on to us.
You are such a good actor.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.516
I never thought your first role
would be an all-in-one machine.

16:40.517 --> 16:41.886
[Leo babbles]
- I know.

16:41.887 --> 16:43.277
[sighs]

16:43.287 --> 16:46.186
This is the hot pipe room
and this shall be your day care.

16:46.187 --> 16:49.626
I'm sorry, but I'm not supposed
to bring my baby into work.

16:49.627 --> 16:52.296
All right,
baby monitor here for you.

16:52.297 --> 16:53.996
I'll take this one.
I'm right next door.

16:53.997 --> 16:54.567
I'll take this one.
I'm right next door.

16:54.557 --> 16:56.187
I'll be back in two minutes
to check on you.

16:56.197 --> 16:57.836
You need anything, call me.

16:57.837 --> 16:59.357
I love you.
Bye.

17:03.667 --> 17:06.196
- Oh! There you are.
We need to talk.

17:06.207 --> 17:07.675
- Okay.
- Been looking all over for you.

17:07.676 --> 17:09.006
- Hey, hey, quit grabbing at me.

17:09.007 --> 17:10.705
- It's just I find myself
in a bit of a pickle.

17:10.707 --> 17:12.175
- Hmm.
- I went to convince Whitney

17:12.176 --> 17:16.546
to break up with Jeremy
and I ended up laying with her.

17:16.547 --> 17:18.777
- You slept with Whitney?

17:18.787 --> 17:20.386
Are you out of your mind?
You're Jeremy's best friend!

17:20.387 --> 17:22.026
You guys were gonna perform
"Lady Marmalade"

17:22.027 --> 17:23.217
at the hospital talent show!

17:23.227 --> 17:23.997
- I know.
I know what I did was bad,

17:23.997 --> 17:24.926
- I know.
I know what I did was bad,

17:24.928 --> 17:27.226
but their relationship is wrong.

17:27.227 --> 17:30.166
Maybe, in a way,
this is what had to happen.

17:30.167 --> 17:32.836
Maybe, in a way, I'm a hero.

17:32.837 --> 17:35.436
- That sucked. That logic is bad
and you know it, okay?

17:35.437 --> 17:36.706
You have to go tell him.
- I know.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.766
I'll just move away.
I'll make new friends.

17:38.767 --> 17:39.867
I'll sleep
with their girlfriends and...

17:39.877 --> 17:41.976
Oh! See?
There I go again.

17:41.977 --> 17:45.306
- Oh, my God.
You are the worst person.

17:45.307 --> 17:47.576
You are so selfish,
you have no concept

17:47.577 --> 17:48.707
of what anyone else
goes through.

17:48.717 --> 17:50.286
[Leo cries]

17:50.287 --> 17:52.516
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you
over the sound

17:52.517 --> 17:53.987
of your baby gurgling
in a box on the floor.

17:53.997 --> 17:54.997
Of your baby gurgling
in a box on the floor.

17:54.998 --> 17:56.486
- Okay, okay, that's enough.

17:56.487 --> 17:58.086
Thomas Jefferson owned slaves,
all right?

17:58.087 --> 17:59.917
Sometimes cool people
make mistakes.

17:59.927 --> 18:01.326
Hey, sweetheart.

18:01.327 --> 18:04.166
[pager beeps]

18:04.167 --> 18:06.466
All right, I have a delivery.

18:06.467 --> 18:08.236
I don't know what to do.
Such a bad idea.

18:08.237 --> 18:10.536
I'm such a bad mother.
- No, take it easy now.

18:10.537 --> 18:12.436
You're doing an admirable job.

18:12.437 --> 18:14.036
Why don't you let me watch
the little fella

18:14.037 --> 18:15.567
while you're at the hospital?

18:15.577 --> 18:18.376
- Can I trust you?
- I'm great with kids.

18:18.377 --> 18:20.307
My Uncle Randy got kicked
in the head by a mule.

18:20.317 --> 18:22.657
He had the brain of an infant.
Took care of him for years,

18:22.647 --> 18:23.987
and now he's
a Mississippi state senator.

18:23.997 --> 18:25.626
And now he's
a Mississippi state senator.

18:25.627 --> 18:28.247
- Okay, it's just for an hour.
I would really appreciate that.

18:28.257 --> 18:29.626
- Sure, absolutely.

18:29.627 --> 18:31.157
- Thanks, Jody.
- Sure.

18:37.297 --> 18:40.036
Hello, little box baby.

18:40.037 --> 18:42.637
You might be a big help
to your Uncle Jody.

18:47.637 --> 18:48.806
- Hi, Jody.
- Hi.

18:48.807 --> 18:50.267
- Is that Leo?
- Yeah.

18:50.277 --> 18:51.277
- Where's Mindy?

18:51.278 --> 18:52.546
Did she get lost
following the scent

18:52.547 --> 18:53.646
of an apple pie again?

18:53.647 --> 18:55.586
- Oh, no.
I'm just babysitting.

18:55.587 --> 18:56.646
- Oh, okay.

18:56.647 --> 18:58.377
- Jeremy, you wouldn't hit a man

18:58.387 --> 18:59.426
carrying a baby, would you?

18:59.427 --> 19:00.916
- Of course not.
Why?

19:00.917 --> 19:03.117
- I slept with Whitney
in her office.

19:03.127 --> 19:05.226
- What? Jody,
put that baby down

19:05.227 --> 19:07.096
so I can strike you.
- No, I won't. I won't.

19:07.097 --> 19:08.126
- Put it down.
- I won't.

19:08.127 --> 19:11.066
- Damn it!
We were friends, Jody.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.866
- Look, I'm sorry,
but I'm glad I did it.

19:13.867 --> 19:14.996
Any woman who'd sleep

19:14.997 --> 19:15.167
with a scoundrel like me
doesn't deserve you.

19:15.177 --> 19:16.336
With a scoundrel like me
doesn't deserve you.

19:16.337 --> 19:18.206
You deserve someone
who's gonna treat you right.

19:18.207 --> 19:21.076
And even if you don't think
you do, I know you do.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.676
And I'm gonna keep on
sleeping with your girlfriends

19:22.677 --> 19:24.446
until you realize it.
Shh.

19:24.447 --> 19:27.646
Now, if you still feel like
you'll feel better...

19:27.647 --> 19:32.516
- [grunts]
- Oh, God almighty!

19:32.517 --> 19:34.077
- Thank you, Jody.
I do feel better.

19:34.087 --> 19:35.697
- All right.
- Actually, can I hit you again?

19:35.687 --> 19:37.086
- Nope. Nope.
I-I'd prefer if you didn't.

19:37.087 --> 19:38.586
- Maybe you're right.

19:38.587 --> 19:40.517
Maybe I should find
a woman I deserve.

19:40.527 --> 19:43.526
A quiet, plain, simple girl.

19:43.527 --> 19:45.167
Maybe someone who's gone mute
since she witnessed a crime.

19:45.177 --> 19:46.107
Maybe someone who's gone mute
since she witnessed a crime.

19:46.108 --> 19:47.457
- No, uh, I tell you what.

19:47.467 --> 19:48.836
I'm gonna make it my mission

19:48.837 --> 19:50.336
to find you a lady
who's good enough for you.

19:50.337 --> 19:52.646
- If you do,
don't sleep with her.

19:52.647 --> 19:54.836
- I swear on our friendship

19:54.837 --> 19:56.637
I will try not to.

19:56.647 --> 19:58.606
- Okay.

19:58.607 --> 19:59.776
God, you smell of her.

19:59.777 --> 20:01.207
- Apologies.
- [sniffs deeply]

20:01.217 --> 20:03.986
<i>- Well, Leo, I am sorry.</i>

20:03.987 --> 20:06.186
I definitely did not
live up to my

20:06.187 --> 20:07.986
Mother of the Year
beer coozy today,

20:07.987 --> 20:09.792
but, don't worry,
as my punishment

20:09.793 --> 20:12.717
there is no food left
in the house for my dinner.

20:19.967 --> 20:21.696
Whoa, Leo, there's still one

20:21.697 --> 20:23.737
of your grandmother's rigatoni's
left in the fridge.

20:26.477 --> 20:29.376
<i>- "Dear Mindy, this is
eight servings of pasta,</i>

20:29.377 --> 20:32.646
<i>can you make this one
last two days for God's sake?"</i>

20:32.647 --> 20:33.946
- That's pretty rude.

20:33.947 --> 20:36.886
<i>- "Dear Leo,
sleep tight, my little angel,</i>

20:36.887 --> 20:40.186

20:45.178 --> 20:46.426
<i>[knock on door]</i>

20:46.427 --> 20:48.126
Annette, I can hear
the Cash For Gold commercial.

20:48.127 --> 20:49.926
Open up.

20:49.927 --> 20:51.996
- I'd open the door,
but I don't want to

20:51.997 --> 20:53.557
<i>invade</i> your personal space.

20:53.567 --> 20:55.366
- Okay.
- Ooh, good burn.

20:55.367 --> 20:57.697
- You know what, Dot?
It wasn't that good of a burn.

20:57.707 --> 21:01.336
But I did deserve that.

21:01.337 --> 21:02.967
Annette, please forgive me.

21:02.977 --> 21:04.916
All right? I'm sorry
I took you for granted,

21:04.917 --> 21:07.476
but Leo needs you.

21:07.477 --> 21:08.876
Okay, well...

21:08.877 --> 21:11.677
- Of course he does!
I'm his grandma!

21:16.127 --> 21:18.986
But some words
can't be taken back.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.356
- I know. I know.
I'm so sorry.

21:21.357 --> 21:22.787
I shouldn't have called you
"grandmonster"

21:22.797 --> 21:25.266
and "Annette Notfunicello"
and "Annetti Spaghetti."

21:25.267 --> 21:28.566
- You called me those things?
- No. Never.

21:28.567 --> 21:29.627
I've heard
other people say them,

21:29.637 --> 21:31.036
but I've always defended you.

21:31.037 --> 21:32.606
Look, there is a reason why
I fell in love

21:32.607 --> 21:34.806
with a hyper-religious,
supremely Italian,

21:34.807 --> 21:37.012
little weirdo,
'cause I need that in my life.

21:37.013 --> 21:38.606
- You better be
talking about Danny.

21:38.607 --> 21:40.276
- Yeah, I am
talking about Danny, Dot,

21:40.277 --> 21:42.507
but I'm also talking about you.

21:42.517 --> 21:43.916
Look, when you come
and take care of Leo,

21:43.917 --> 21:45.176
you're not just
taking care of him.

21:45.177 --> 21:46.686
You're not just
taking care of him.

21:46.687 --> 21:48.656
You're taking care of me.

21:48.657 --> 21:53.126
And I can't do this by myself.
I need your help.

21:53.127 --> 21:55.866
Please come back.

21:55.867 --> 21:59.396
- Okay, I'll come back,
but just for Leo.

21:59.397 --> 22:02.396
- No, and for me
because you love me.

22:02.397 --> 22:05.636
- No, I only love five people.

22:05.637 --> 22:07.197
Danny, Richie, Leo, Dot,

22:07.207 --> 22:08.616
and the handsome one
from "Suits."

22:08.617 --> 22:10.937
- And me. You love me.
- No.

22:10.947 --> 22:12.317
- You do, and you're gonna
hug me now.

22:12.307 --> 22:13.537
- No, I'm not!
What are you doing?

22:13.547 --> 22:15.146
No! Let go...
You stop it!

22:15.147 --> 22:15.177
Get your paws off me!

22:15.178 --> 22:16.356
Get your paws off me!

22:16.357 --> 22:18.307
- She does not love you!

22:18.317 --> 22:19.656
This is assault!

22:19.657 --> 22:20.956
- Okay, okay.
I love you.

22:20.957 --> 22:22.856
Just go put that baby
to bed, all right?

22:22.857 --> 22:24.326
Go home.
I'll see you later, you idiot.

22:24.327 --> 22:25.686
- Okay.
You're obsessed with me.

22:25.687 --> 22:26.987
And you're gonna be
thinking about that hug later.

22:26.997 --> 22:28.326
- Go soak your head.
- I guarantee it.
