to your mother, for example,

We need to be respected
and valued.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.500
That teacher didn't even
thank me for what I did.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.435
For attacking
harriet tubman?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.304
What was I
supposed to do?

16:46.306 --> 16:48.373
Oh, my...
Teaching our kids nonsense

16:48.375 --> 16:50.742
Like harriet tubman was a spy
in the civil war.

16:50.744 --> 16:53.011
She<i> was</i> a spy.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.113
Her code name was "moses."

16:55.115 --> 16:56.547
And how do you know this?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.750
Because it was in the packet
that ms. Davis sent home.

16:58.752 --> 17:02.053
Yeah, a packet
that she probably wrote!

17:02.055 --> 17:03.087
Oh, my god.

17:03.089 --> 17:04.756
You have become
the crazy mom.

17:04.758 --> 17:06.591
You realize that,
right?

17:06.593 --> 17:08.426
It's no longer
stacy kang-nussbaum.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.528
It's you.
You're crazy mom.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.597
You know, if anyone's crazy,
it's<i> you.</i>

17:12.599 --> 17:14.432
What?
Zoey told me
what you did.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.201
You sat on her bed.
Who does that?

17:17.203 --> 17:19.270
Okay, let's not
change the subject, okay?

17:19.272 --> 17:22.073
No, we are talking about<i> you.</i>
You are a praise junkie.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.574
Uh --

17:23.576 --> 17:25.676
And<i> you</i> are
a control freak.

17:25.678 --> 17:26.778
What?!

17:26.780 --> 17:28.212
Yes! Excuse me.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.781
Don't think
I didn't notice

17:29.783 --> 17:31.749
You re-put away
all the silverware.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.218
You told me
that you wanted me to do it,

17:34.220 --> 17:35.486
But you don't want me
to do it.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.756
I just want you to do it
how<i> I</i> do it.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.758
[ drawer slams ]
okay, look --

17:40.760 --> 17:42.393
No, it's not crazy.
Look, okay.

17:42.395 --> 17:46.197
It's supposed to be
big fork, little fork,
big spoon, little spoon.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.199
You put it in here
big fork, big spoon,

17:48.201 --> 17:50.468
Little fork, little spoon --
like a maniac.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.738
And now it's chaos
all up in the drawer.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.774
I'm being abused
for working hard,

17:56.776 --> 17:58.810
Just like harriet tubman.

17:58.812 --> 18:02.847
Who -- who would put a spatula
with a can opener?

18:02.849 --> 18:06.551
That's a lunatic!
You're a lunatic because...

18:06.553 --> 18:10.321
Mommies need to be
with their babies, dre!

18:10.323 --> 18:12.423
What is going on
out here, son?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.759
I can hear you all the way
out to the guest house,

18:14.761 --> 18:17.128
Where I am trying to entertain
a lady friend.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.763
Bow is being
unreasonable, man.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.365
Bow is being a mom.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.568
The problem is,
<i>you're</i> trying to be a mom, too,

18:23.570 --> 18:25.269
And you're being all crazy
with it,

18:25.271 --> 18:27.138
Yelling at teachers
for teaching,

18:27.140 --> 18:28.506
Forks and spoons
all willy-nilly.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.108
I-I know.
I can't handle it!

18:30.110 --> 18:31.809
[ chuckles ] see, there?
"freaky Friday."

18:31.811 --> 18:33.778
And you didn't even get
that far into the week.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.514
Nothing sadder than a freaky
Thursday, son -- nothing.

18:36.516 --> 18:39.283
Okay, pops, I get it.
I messed up, all right?

18:39.285 --> 18:41.285
[ sighs ]

18:41.287 --> 18:42.753
You know what?
I-I'm just gonna go talk to bow.

18:42.755 --> 18:46.124
Do that. Lose what little
dignity you have left.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.758
So you don't think
I should say anything?

18:47.760 --> 18:50.428
I think sometimes
talking is overrated.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.897
The way I see it,
crazy got you in.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.465
Crazy can get you out.

Later.

Mom, will you
make us breakfast?

19:06.179 --> 19:08.679
I can't take any more
of dad's pancakes.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.714
Too much sugar.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.316
We miss
your steel-cut oatmeal.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.384
Well, dad was actually --

19:13.386 --> 19:15.186
It's...So good.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.821
We hate flavor.

Okay, babies.
I'll make you breakfast.

Oh. Wha--

That's so nice...

Go!

Hey, mom.

You want to...
Sit on my bed later?

Dad, do you mind if mom
takes us to school this morning?

19:55.895 --> 19:57.862
Son, that's what
this whole week was about --

19:57.864 --> 19:59.497
Giving your mother
a break.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.599
Please?
It's so slow and safe.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.268
We<i> love</i> listening
to your books on tape.

What? It's...

20:05.438 --> 20:07.672
Rainbow: Really, babe?
What?

20:07.674 --> 20:09.674
You could've at least had them
rehearse a little more.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.808
That was like
some really bad theater.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.577
[ chuckles ]
I know.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.912
So, you want things to go back
the way they were?

20:14.914 --> 20:16.514
Maybe a little.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.382
It's not as easy
as you thought, is it?

No, it's not, babe.
You know what?
No.

To hell with being
the unsung hero.
I want to be sung.

20:22.956 --> 20:25.623
Well, as much as I hate
to admit it,

20:25.625 --> 20:28.626
I actually miss
doing the little things.

20:28.628 --> 20:31.829
And it kind of burns off
my working-mom guilt.

Babe, babe.
