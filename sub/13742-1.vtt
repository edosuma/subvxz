THE DEAD GIRL

03:04.030 --> 03:05.660
Arden?

03:12.870 --> 03:15.240
Arden?

03:15.310 --> 03:17.780
Are you down there?

03:24.580 --> 03:26.020
Arden?

03:32.690 --> 03:34.460
Arden?

03:38.562 --> 03:41.148
THE STRANGER

04:06.560 --> 04:08.490
All right.

05:13.190 --> 05:14.660
Right there.

05:14.730 --> 05:17.090
Ma'am, please wait here.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.590
Oh, shit!

05:23.940 --> 05:26.960
Dispatch 27, got an 1144-

05:27.040 --> 05:29.510
What did they say to you?

05:29.570 --> 05:31.340
Nothing.

05:31.410 --> 05:34.000
Twenty five minutes of nothing?

05:34.080 --> 05:36.410
There's a dead girl.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.380
They just asked some questions.

05:38.450 --> 05:40.820
What are they asking you for?

05:40.890 --> 05:42.320
You don't know anything.

05:44.590 --> 05:46.490
I found her.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.890
And you called the Police.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.860
You're the reason those
bloodsuckers are out there,

05:51.930 --> 05:53.660
swarming all over my yard,

05:53.730 --> 05:55.600
ringing my bell, like they know me.

05:55.670 --> 05:58.230
Before I know it, they're going
to be pouring into my cupboards,

05:58.300 --> 05:59.790
climbing up my stairs!

05:59.870 --> 06:01.430
I just told them about the dead girl!

06:01.510 --> 06:03.270
You found her. So what!

06:03.340 --> 06:05.930
You keep walking! You
keep your mouth shut!

06:06.010 --> 06:07.910
You stupid!

06:07.980 --> 06:10.040
Are you the one that found the body?

06:10.110 --> 06:12.600
Could we just get an interview?

06:12.680 --> 06:15.150
What were you doing in that area?

06:15.220 --> 06:17.050
Did you know that she was mutilated?

07:11.870 --> 07:14.140
And 60 cents change.

07:14.210 --> 07:15.730
You want help out?

07:15.810 --> 07:17.140
Thas okay.

07:22.950 --> 07:24.820
Uh, where is-
where is your car?

07:37.530 --> 07:41.370
Hey, you look sweet on TV.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.340
That was you, wasn't it?

07:45.110 --> 07:47.770
Yeah, some people
- some people are mean, you know,

07:47.840 --> 07:50.210
you can see it right here but-

07:50.280 --> 07:52.710
you look real sweet.

07:52.780 --> 07:53.970
Oh, I got it.

07:54.050 --> 07:56.380
You want 'em in the back or the front?

07:56.450 --> 07:58.010
Back, please.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.480
Uh, you-you need to open it.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.650
I'd like to take you out sometime.

08:07.730 --> 08:09.720
Oh! I don't really-

08:09.800 --> 08:11.390
You don't want to go out with me?

08:14.900 --> 08:17.390
Come on. Come out with me.

08:17.470 --> 08:19.410
Id be fun. I get off at 11.

08:19.470 --> 08:21.570
I can't.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.640
Why? You got a boyfriend?

08:24.710 --> 08:27.740
No.

08:44.530 --> 08:46.660
I'm not gonna hurt you.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.670
Thank you.

08:49.740 --> 08:52.710
So, I'll see you at 11?

09:54.070 --> 09:56.060
Arden?

10:09.080 --> 10:10.670
What did you do to your face?

10:10.750 --> 10:12.450
Nothing.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.420
Whas that stink?

10:14.490 --> 10:15.980
Nothing.

10:16.060 --> 10:19.580
The milk is sour.

10:22.930 --> 10:24.420
Take that off.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.490
No!

10:25.560 --> 10:27.530
Take it off!

10:38.510 --> 10:41.810
You look like a two dollar hooker.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.950
You'd have to pay them!

10:52.190 --> 10:54.280
Where are the cameras now, Miss America?

10:54.360 --> 10:57.490
Prancing up and down,
look at me! Look at me!

10:57.560 --> 11:00.160
Spending all my money on all this crap!

11:00.230 --> 11:04.330
Looking in the mirror day and
night like a goddamn whore!

11:04.400 --> 11:08.600
Oh, Jesus! He took the wrong one!

11:08.670 --> 11:10.800
It shoulda been you, not my boy!

11:10.880 --> 11:14.870
Don't you talk about
him! Don't you ever!

11:31.560 --> 11:33.900
You filthy thing!

11:33.970 --> 11:37.530
I'll tell them what you did!

11:38.970 --> 11:40.370
They'll arrest you!

11:44.610 --> 11:50.510
You leave me, nobody can want you.

11:50.580 --> 11:53.780
You have nothing.

11:53.850 --> 11:56.120
I'm bleeding.

11:56.190 --> 11:57.880
Arden, I'm bleeding.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.260
There's blood on me!

12:28.120 --> 12:30.110
So, what was it like?

12:30.190 --> 12:32.280
What was what like?

12:32.360 --> 12:35.880
Finding that dead girl.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.560
I don't know.

12:42.630 --> 12:44.900
Sad. I guess.

12:44.970 --> 12:48.340
She had cuts on her hands, right?

12:48.410 --> 12:50.670
How do you know?

12:50.740 --> 12:55.610
Is defense. It means
she tried to fight.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.650
Her clothes were all cut up, too, right?

12:57.710 --> 13:02.010
She wasn't wearing any clothes.

13:02.090 --> 13:03.990
Why would her clothes be cut up?

13:04.050 --> 13:05.720
Not a functional cutting.

13:05.790 --> 13:08.920
Thas what they call it when
the cuts don't serve any purpose.

13:08.990 --> 13:10.650
The 405 killer did the same thing.

13:10.730 --> 13:12.890
All of his victims had
these cuts in their clothes

13:12.960 --> 13:15.590
that the cops couldn't
explain, 'cause they didn't

13:15.670 --> 13:18.030
make any sense with the
wounds the girls had.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.400
And then, when they finally caught him,

13:20.470 --> 13:22.870
they realized that it
was part of his foreplay.

13:22.940 --> 13:25.670
And then, when they
looked into his records,

13:25.740 --> 13:28.870
they found out that he'd been
caught stealing women's clothes

13:28.950 --> 13:31.140
off the clothesline
when he was 12 years old.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.440
And the cops went to his parents' house

13:33.520 --> 13:35.780
and they asked him why he did it,

13:35.850 --> 13:39.290
and he started crying and he handed over

13:39.360 --> 13:41.220
a box full of women's underwear

13:41.290 --> 13:46.630
bras and nylons and
underwear all cut up.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.630
And right then and there,

13:49.700 --> 13:53.230
the cops let a serial killer
slip through their fingers.

13:55.770 --> 13:57.360
Why did he do it?

13:57.440 --> 14:00.600
It made him feel better.

14:00.680 --> 14:05.550
You know, he'd get all
frustrated or something,

14:05.620 --> 14:07.710
then he'd cut up things.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.310
No.

14:10.390 --> 14:12.150
Why did he kill the women?

14:13.960 --> 14:16.360
Probably something
to do with his mother.

14:19.130 --> 14:22.190
Thas what it usually is.

14:22.260 --> 14:24.730
Her eyes were open.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.330
Oh, yeah?

14:31.870 --> 14:33.930
She was just lying there.

14:34.010 --> 14:38.140
Hey, you know, what
would be the coolest thing

14:38.210 --> 14:41.240
if when somebody's died, you could-

14:41.320 --> 14:43.650
peel off the top layer of their eyeball

14:43.720 --> 14:46.690
and develop it like film
so you could have a picture

14:46.760 --> 14:47.920
of the last thing they saw.

14:51.490 --> 14:53.190
It was trees.

14:56.900 --> 14:58.300
And the sky.

15:01.570 --> 15:02.800
This was hers.

15:05.110 --> 15:06.440
Could I hold it?

15:13.980 --> 15:16.450
You ain't yanking my chain, are ya?

15:23.490 --> 15:24.480
Thas her hair.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.320
I know.

15:32.270 --> 15:35.000
Sorry. Just, sorry.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.770
Why do you think I brought you here?

15:48.220 --> 15:50.120
I don't know.

15:52.820 --> 15:55.480
You think is maybe because I like you?

15:58.460 --> 16:00.480
I don't know.

16:04.770 --> 16:06.060
You want to kiss me?

16:08.740 --> 16:09.730
Okay.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.270
So do it.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.620
Then you don't want to kiss me?

16:24.680 --> 16:26.520
I don't know.

16:26.590 --> 16:28.380
You want me to kiss you?

16:32.330 --> 16:35.020
You gonna hold still this time?

16:36.860 --> 16:38.630
Okay.

16:38.700 --> 16:41.500
I don't have to tie you up, do I?

16:44.570 --> 16:45.940
Maybe.

16:49.510 --> 16:51.140
Maybe what?

16:56.780 --> 16:58.880
Maybe you should tie me up.

16:58.950 --> 17:01.010
Or maybe you should just hold still.

17:01.090 --> 17:02.880
Okay.

17:17.140 --> 17:19.730
You want to get in
the back seat with me?

17:24.579 --> 17:26.200
Why not?

18:05.780 --> 18:07.050
Whas that for?

18:07.120 --> 18:09.780
I don't know.

18:24.800 --> 18:29.670
Is this what you want?

18:29.740 --> 18:32.210
I'd probably get out of that.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.880
Shit.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.580
Shit!

19:56.030 --> 19:57.360
Whas the matter?

19:58.560 --> 19:59.820
Whas wrong?

19:59.900 --> 20:01.190
No, I just can't do it like that.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.360
Why? Whad I do?

20:03.430 --> 20:04.990
You don't even kiss me.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.900
You're just lying there,
like you want me to rape you!

20:07.970 --> 20:08.960
Okay.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.130
You want me to rape you?

20:13.780 --> 20:15.540
I'll kiss you back.

20:15.610 --> 20:17.510
And take the gloves off.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.630
You need stitches for that.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.070
It doesn't really hurt.

20:47.580 --> 20:52.600
Not when
- you're kissing me.

21:33.920 --> 21:38.590
Some serial killers use objects
when they can't get it up.

21:38.660 --> 21:41.320
You know, like they'll, uh,

21:41.400 --> 21:47.560
they'll find bottles

21:47.640 --> 21:50.570
and all sorts of things out there.

21:57.450 --> 22:01.400
I don't want to talk about
serial killers anymore.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.730
911 operator, may I assist you?

22:25.810 --> 22:29.170
Whas your emergency? Hello?

22:29.240 --> 22:30.900
911.

22:30.980 --> 22:35.180
There's a woman,

22:35.250 --> 22:36.310
the woman needs help.

22:36.380 --> 22:37.780
Is she injured?

22:37.850 --> 22:39.790
Her daughter left her.

22:39.850 --> 22:43.190
Is the woman there with you?

22:43.260 --> 22:45.880
Hello?

22:45.960 --> 22:47.090
No.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.720
Where is she?

22:48.800 --> 22:49.780
Ma'am?

22:49.860 --> 22:52.160
She's in the house-

22:52.230 --> 22:53.860
where they found the dead girl.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.240
They finally approved our proposal,

23:03.310 --> 23:07.080
to post a missing childrens'
board near Jenny's bench.

23:07.210 --> 23:11.210
Is good, is good. Ill just be
one more way of spreading the word.

23:12.990 --> 23:15.280
Pigtail shot, you know,
we've overdone that.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.980
I'm gonna have to rule that out.

23:17.060 --> 23:19.080
Your father thinks we
should go with the headband

23:19.160 --> 23:22.750
but, l-l-I like
the Christmas tree.

23:22.830 --> 23:24.490
Yeah.

23:24.560 --> 23:28.660
We have used this shot so
many times, you know, l-

23:28.740 --> 23:30.260
maybe the pigtails.

23:37.610 --> 23:40.310
The black and white is not-

23:40.380 --> 23:43.970
doing it for me anymore, I
think the color would be better.

23:44.050 --> 23:49.180
So, I'm-I'm gonna, yeah,
I'm gonna go with the color.

23:49.250 --> 23:50.920
I don't know.

23:50.990 --> 23:53.890
Maybe we should go with
the age progression.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.450
Whichever you think.

23:59.700 --> 24:05.160
What do you think it
might look like to move on?

24:05.240 --> 24:08.540
Well, my mom,

24:08.610 --> 24:11.670
and Dad and me, we'd-

24:11.740 --> 24:14.510
pack up all the stuff from her room,

24:14.580 --> 24:19.880
and we'd take all the boxes with the-

24:19.950 --> 24:25.890
newspaper reports, and the false
leads, and the posters, and-

24:25.960 --> 24:31.860
we'd burn everything in a big bonfire.

24:31.930 --> 24:37.930
And then we'd-cry and hold one another.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.600
And then we'd-

24:40.670 --> 24:43.510
fall asleep for like-

24:43.580 --> 24:47.310
a thousand years

24:47.380 --> 24:49.040
and then, in the morning,

24:49.110 --> 24:58.040
we'd wake up and- the
sun would be shining and-

24:58.120 --> 25:02.220
my mom would go back into the kitchen

25:02.290 --> 25:08.390
and start making breakfast and-

25:08.470 --> 25:17.640
my dad would say, "Go get
ready for school" and smile.

25:17.710 --> 25:20.870
And-

25:20.950 --> 25:23.180
everything would be okay again.

25:29.190 --> 25:34.060
Well, not okay, but
- you got a chance to be.

25:37.330 --> 25:41.290
She's been gone for-

25:41.370 --> 25:46.700
15 years.

25:46.770 --> 25:49.400
Ill never be okay.

25:53.610 --> 25:58.100
Ill never be over.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.000
I'm heading out.

26:15.070 --> 26:16.460
Oh, okay.

26:16.530 --> 26:19.160
Murray wants to do the
Jane Doe in the morning.

26:19.240 --> 26:20.830
She's parked in the deep freeze.

26:20.900 --> 26:22.270
Do you mind prepping her?

26:22.340 --> 26:24.500
Sure.

26:27.440 --> 26:30.710
My roommate and I are having a
little get together tomorrow night.

26:30.780 --> 26:33.680
Just a host dissertation,

26:33.750 --> 26:37.690
throw-your-computer out-the-window
celebration kind of thing.

26:37.750 --> 26:40.280
Um, if you feel like stopping by-

26:40.360 --> 26:44.820
I'll probably be in
the library but, thanks.

26:44.890 --> 26:47.950
You could come by afterwards.

26:48.030 --> 26:51.400
I'll see.

26:51.470 --> 26:54.560
Okay. Don't work too hard.

28:05.690 --> 28:09.120
TATTOS: 12:13
BIRTHMARK ON HAND
NO KNOWN RELATIVES

28:18.870 --> 28:20.400
Genesis 12:13

28:20.470 --> 28:21.970
Say you are my sister, so that
I will be treated well for your sake

28:22.040 --> 28:23.530
and my life will be spared
because of you.

28:25.890 --> 28:28.120
Hasn't your sister been
missing a long time?

28:28.200 --> 28:30.790
She was taken from the state
park less than ten miles

28:30.870 --> 28:33.990
from where this girl's body was found.

28:34.070 --> 28:36.400
Leah, with age-progressed
photos, though-

28:36.470 --> 28:37.870
I know, they're a guess.

28:37.940 --> 28:40.430
This girl, she has a
birthmark on her left hand

28:40.510 --> 28:43.030
between her fingers, same as Jenny.

28:43.110 --> 28:44.640
I want Andy to do the dentals.

28:46.980 --> 28:48.970
Okay. All right.

28:50.690 --> 28:51.980
Who is this?

28:52.050 --> 28:54.210
Detective sent this
photo as a possible match

28:54.290 --> 28:56.450
for a Jane Doe we have in the morgue.

28:59.830 --> 29:02.950
No. Those aren't her eyes.

29:03.030 --> 29:05.730
Her-her
eyes-

29:05.800 --> 29:07.270
her eyes aren't that light.

29:07.330 --> 29:09.890
She has a birthmark on her left hand

29:09.970 --> 29:12.500
between her fingers just like Jenny.

29:12.570 --> 29:14.800
No-is not Jenny.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.370
I checked the report and
they can't find any family.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.350
Those are not her eyes!

29:20.410 --> 29:21.850
Is her.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.850
No.

30:14.170 --> 30:17.160
Hard to believe is over.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.800
Yeah, I know.

30:40.430 --> 30:41.830
You came.

30:41.890 --> 30:43.230
Yeah.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.420
All right!

30:44.500 --> 30:46.590
Want something to drink?

30:46.670 --> 30:49.930
A beer? A soda? Champagne?

30:52.240 --> 30:53.470
...Champagne.

30:53.540 --> 30:55.530
All right.

30:59.480 --> 31:02.940
So, why tonight?

31:03.020 --> 31:05.880
I've been inviting you to
my parties for three years.

31:05.950 --> 31:06.940
Have you?

31:09.290 --> 31:11.150
I don't know about you but,

31:11.220 --> 31:15.450
every now and then I like to be
around somebody thas not dead.

31:15.530 --> 31:17.590
Yeah, I guess.

31:17.660 --> 31:18.960
So, how's it going so far?

31:19.030 --> 31:21.560
So far, so good.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.030
Excellent.

31:23.100 --> 31:24.730
You're a lot more talkative.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.900
Right.

31:33.180 --> 31:36.410
I'm on antidepressants.

31:39.020 --> 31:40.310
Oh, yeah?

31:40.390 --> 31:43.580
Used to spend most of
my free time in bed.

31:43.660 --> 31:46.150
That could be nice.

31:46.220 --> 31:48.750
It can also be kind of depressing.

31:48.830 --> 31:53.020
Yeah, is good to get out
of bed every once in a while.

31:53.100 --> 31:56.090
Is kind of hard to make friends.

31:56.170 --> 31:58.330
In bed? Yeah.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.930
Although,

32:04.980 --> 32:06.710
Yeah.

32:28.100 --> 32:31.160
You have excellent posture.

32:31.230 --> 32:33.730
Do I? Oh my...

32:33.800 --> 32:35.470
Is nice.

32:38.340 --> 32:42.750
I feel like if I let go of
you, you're gonna run away.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.840
Well, then don't let go.

33:10.340 --> 33:11.400
Hey.

33:15.180 --> 33:16.300
Hi.

33:29.660 --> 33:31.920
Stay. Please?

33:31.990 --> 33:34.490
Promise I'll let you sleep.

33:34.560 --> 33:37.160
Oh, no, I can't, I have to go.

33:37.230 --> 33:39.760
I was getting kind
of sick of you anyway.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.530
Really?

33:41.600 --> 33:43.940
No, just joking.

33:44.010 --> 33:46.470
I'm really glad you came.

33:46.540 --> 33:48.530
So am I.

33:48.610 --> 33:49.810
Are you?

33:49.880 --> 33:53.320
Yeah. I wanted to, for a long time.

33:53.380 --> 33:57.940
Really? Thas good to know.

34:00.160 --> 34:03.020
Okay, I have to go! I gotta go.

34:04.930 --> 34:05.890
Well, see you later.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.560
Bye.

34:11.770 --> 34:12.760
Yo.

34:12.840 --> 34:14.100
Derek?

34:14.170 --> 34:16.830
Hey you. How you doing?

34:16.909 --> 34:20.710
Good. Good, actually.

34:20.780 --> 34:23.570
Work must be pretty boring without me.

34:23.650 --> 34:25.199
When you got a minute.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.110
What are you wearing? That sexy-

34:27.179 --> 34:28.980
I gotta go. I'll call you back.

34:29.050 --> 34:30.310
Wait!

34:33.889 --> 34:35.690
Did Andy get the stuff?

34:35.760 --> 34:37.880
Is not her.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.690
Did he check the films?

34:40.760 --> 34:42.350
They were negative for a match.

34:42.429 --> 34:45.659
I got a call this morning
from a Detective Graily.

34:45.730 --> 34:47.630
They tracked down the girl's mother

34:47.699 --> 34:50.400
and she's driving down from
Washington to ID the body.

34:50.469 --> 34:54.199
Well, thas-wrong.
It has to be, I mean-

34:54.280 --> 34:55.969
The woman's name is Melora Kutcher,

34:56.040 --> 34:58.410
and her daughter's real
name was Krista Kutcher.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.880
She faxed the detectives a
birth certificate and a photo.

35:00.950 --> 35:03.080
I'm sorry.

35:34.350 --> 35:36.280
Hi, is Leah, leave a message.

35:37.850 --> 35:41.250
Leah, is me. Are you around?

35:41.320 --> 35:45.120
You okay? You alive?

35:48.300 --> 35:54.330
Okay, I'm just, uh, trying you again.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.800
Just call me back, okay?

35:56.870 --> 35:58.930
Even if is just to tell me to-

35:59.010 --> 36:02.440
you know, leave you the hell alone.

36:02.510 --> 36:05.070
Just want to know you're okay.

36:05.150 --> 36:07.740
Okay. Bye.

36:12.750 --> 36:15.950
He billed me $3.000 for
a couple of researches.

36:16.020 --> 36:22.520
He can't do that. Jim gave me
the name of another investigator.

36:22.600 --> 36:26.290
I wanna have a memorial
service for Jenny.

36:26.370 --> 36:27.830
What?

36:27.900 --> 36:30.330
Jenny's dead and I want
to have a memorial service.

36:32.710 --> 36:34.570
Why would you say that?

36:34.640 --> 36:36.160
Because is true.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.900
Honey, we don't know that.

36:37.980 --> 36:39.840
She isn't dead, for all we know-

36:39.910 --> 36:41.970
She's dead.

36:42.050 --> 36:43.640
She didn't run away.

36:43.720 --> 36:46.410
She wasn't raised in
the woods by wolves.

36:46.490 --> 36:48.250
She didn't hit her
head and forget her name

36:48.320 --> 36:51.350
and where she lived, and she's
not staying with some nice gypsies.

36:51.420 --> 36:54.420
Some man took her, and
did horrible things to her.

36:54.490 --> 36:57.460
And hid her body so well,
that we'll never find her.

36:57.530 --> 36:59.590
And it doesn't matter
how many posters we hang

36:59.670 --> 37:03.470
or petitions we sign or which
picture we put near Jenny's bench,

37:03.540 --> 37:05.300
because no one's gonna recognize her,

37:05.370 --> 37:07.930
because she's dead and
she's never coming back!

37:08.010 --> 37:11.100
If-she were dead,

37:11.180 --> 37:13.840
don't you think I wouldn't
know it in my heart?

37:13.910 --> 37:18.040
I know she's alive, I know
she's out there somewhere.

37:18.120 --> 37:20.310
And the only way I'm
ever gonna see her again,

37:20.390 --> 37:22.550
is if we never give up.

37:22.620 --> 37:25.960
Someone out there knows
my baby, they know her,

37:26.030 --> 37:28.460
they just don't know
we're looking for her.

37:28.530 --> 37:33.230
I will never give up on her.

37:33.300 --> 37:38.570
Just like I would never
give up on you! Ever. Ever!

39:01.820 --> 39:03.620
Yo.

39:03.690 --> 39:07.050
Will you please help me?

39:11.020 --> 39:16.480
THE WIFE

39:32.320 --> 39:34.480
You're going out now?

39:34.550 --> 39:36.350
Yeah, I just feel like driving.

39:36.420 --> 39:38.680
Did you ever think I might
want to go out sometime?

39:38.760 --> 39:40.920
Did you ever think about that?

39:40.990 --> 39:42.080
Yeah.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.560
But when I want to go somewhere

39:43.630 --> 39:45.360
you don't want to go if I want to go.

39:45.430 --> 39:48.020
Bowling, or dancing-

39:48.100 --> 39:49.760
Dancing?

39:49.830 --> 39:53.100
I am a good dancer. You don't
know it 'cause you never took me.

39:53.170 --> 39:54.660
Come on, Ruth.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.530
When you coming back?

39:56.610 --> 39:57.870
I don't know.

39:57.940 --> 40:01.140
Tonight, tomorrow, a
week from Wednesday?

40:01.210 --> 40:02.580
Don't be like this.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.170
I just want to know.

40:04.250 --> 40:08.340
Maybe I want to make my own plans.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.850
I'm not doing this anymore.

40:13.920 --> 40:17.220
You expect me to step in,

40:17.290 --> 40:20.420
and do your business while
you are out gallivanting,

40:20.500 --> 40:25.800
Mike only knows where, with Mike
only knows what kind of filth!

40:25.870 --> 40:27.460
Jim's working tomorrow.

40:27.540 --> 40:29.770
Well, I won't be here when
you decide to come back.

40:29.840 --> 40:34.140
Then who's-who's gonna wash
your clothes and feed you?

40:34.210 --> 40:37.150
Who's gonna talk to your
boss out of firing you

40:37.210 --> 40:39.610
when he comes breathing
down your neck again?

40:39.680 --> 40:42.410
I just said Jim's working
tomorrow. He'll be here.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.040
But not you.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.780
I don't know. Maybe.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.070
I'll see you later, okay?

41:01.140 --> 41:03.760
No!

41:03.840 --> 41:08.300
Come on, Ruth.

41:08.380 --> 41:12.510
Why do you hate me so much?

41:12.580 --> 41:14.520
I don't hate you.

41:14.580 --> 41:18.880
Then why do you keep trying to
get away from me all the time?

41:18.950 --> 41:20.320
I don't hate you.

41:20.390 --> 41:21.750
Liar.

41:21.820 --> 41:23.810
I just want to take a drive!

41:23.890 --> 41:27.490
Jesus Christ! Why do you have to
make a fucking federal case out of it?

41:27.560 --> 41:32.730
All right! You with
your mouth, just go. Go.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.230
Jesus!

41:34.300 --> 41:36.400
Don't you ever take the
name of the Lord in vain!

41:36.470 --> 41:39.100
Don't you ever
take- Don't you ever-

41:39.170 --> 41:42.440
take His name in vain in my house.

42:08.300 --> 42:11.240
Well, how do you think it
makes me feel to be left here?

42:11.310 --> 42:13.570
I did tell him.

42:13.640 --> 42:17.340
No, he doesn't, he has
no idea how lucky he is.

42:17.410 --> 42:18.500
Lucky he's got both of us.

42:20.210 --> 42:22.980
Thas the door. I gotta go.

42:23.050 --> 42:26.350
If he shows up there, you call me, okay?

42:26.420 --> 42:28.480
I'd appreciate it, okay?

42:28.560 --> 42:30.550
'Cause I can't go through this anymore.

42:33.460 --> 42:35.090
Can I help you?

42:35.160 --> 42:37.220
Hi. We're looking for storage space.

42:37.300 --> 42:40.700
The office says is supposed to
be open but there's nobody there.

42:40.770 --> 42:42.900
Jim's not there?

42:42.970 --> 42:45.770
Uh, nobody's there.

42:45.840 --> 42:48.900
Well, I don't have anything to
do with it. Is my husbanďs job.

42:48.980 --> 42:51.270
Is he around, maybe?

42:59.820 --> 43:01.080
Come on.

43:09.500 --> 43:12.560
One message. Message one.

43:12.630 --> 43:16.400
Carl, is Jim. I can't
come in today. I really-

43:16.470 --> 43:19.910
Message erased. End of messages.

43:27.150 --> 43:29.240
Yeah?

43:29.320 --> 43:31.280
Somebody's stuff is in there.

43:31.350 --> 43:34.840
Nope, is listed as an empty.

43:34.920 --> 43:38.790
Is not.

43:43.660 --> 43:46.100
Well, somebody made a mistake.

43:46.170 --> 43:48.190
Maybe you can just
give us another space.

43:48.270 --> 43:50.790
Is not supposed to have power.

43:50.870 --> 43:52.670
Yeah, well-

43:52.740 --> 43:55.070
Is supposed to be
empty. They keep a list.

44:01.510 --> 44:03.310
So, are we moving this?

44:06.750 --> 44:09.620
I'll get you another space.

47:37.630 --> 47:41.490
We got the five all torn up again.

47:44.730 --> 47:47.100
I don't know when they're
ever gonna finish that thing.

47:47.170 --> 47:50.040
Is been more than a year.

47:50.110 --> 47:52.130
What happened to your neck?

47:52.210 --> 47:55.840
Some guy in a bar,
tried to pick a fight.

47:55.910 --> 47:57.670
You got in a fight?

47:59.980 --> 48:02.920
I'm done with it.

48:02.990 --> 48:05.450
Leaving me here to rot
while you're out doing

48:05.520 --> 48:07.540
Mike only knows what perverted thing

48:07.620 --> 48:10.990
with Mike only knows what
kind of slutty gutter trash!

48:11.060 --> 48:14.150
Come home all scratched up.

48:14.230 --> 48:16.220
You think I don't know what goes on?

48:16.300 --> 48:18.630
I've got my niece in Tula vista.

48:18.700 --> 48:22.330
She says Steve and the kids
would be happy to have me.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.800
Then you'll see what is like

48:23.870 --> 48:25.810
when you have no one to come home to.

48:25.870 --> 48:30.740
When you manage to drag
yourself back to this "h" hole.

48:32.310 --> 48:34.280
I'm sorry.

48:39.290 --> 48:42.520
So you went to a bar.

48:42.590 --> 48:47.250
Well, mostly I just drove around.

48:47.330 --> 48:48.920
Went to see Ray.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.860
I called Ray. He hadn't seen you!

48:50.930 --> 48:53.760
Well, when you called, I
hadn't gotten there yet.

48:53.830 --> 48:56.800
Were you visiting prostitutes again?

48:56.870 --> 48:58.570
No!

48:58.640 --> 49:02.080
I'm not sticking by you this time
if the cops come sniffing around.

49:02.140 --> 49:07.310
I'm done with that filth.
Ya hear me? I'm done with it!

49:07.380 --> 49:11.440
You've been sniffing around
prostitutes, wettin' your little noodle.

49:11.520 --> 49:13.040
Oh, shut up!

49:13.120 --> 49:15.950
You don't like it when I talk
dirty, but what do you do?

49:16.020 --> 49:17.720
Huh?

49:17.790 --> 49:20.160
Sticking your thing
in anything that moves.

49:20.230 --> 49:21.820
Mind your own business!

49:21.900 --> 49:25.420
You stop leaving me here
to mind yours and I will!

49:25.500 --> 49:28.470
I see the scratches on you!

49:28.540 --> 49:31.270
I know what you do!

50:28.330 --> 50:31.560
A beautiful blue Tanzanite Diamond ring.

51:36.130 --> 51:37.360
Thank you.

51:47.770 --> 51:50.430
Do you know anything
about those dead girls?

51:51.740 --> 51:52.730
No.

55:32.630 --> 55:35.790
Well, it would have been about, uh,

55:35.860 --> 55:38.850
nineteen,

55:39.570 --> 55:44.200
ninety-three, I think, it
was, no, thas not right. Um,

55:44.270 --> 55:48.830
she was 16,

55:48.910 --> 55:53.110
she left home, when she was 16.

55:53.180 --> 55:58.170
And that was the last time-

55:58.250 --> 56:01.580
I wrote to her and I left messages.

56:01.660 --> 56:03.560
When I had a number.

56:05.460 --> 56:08.690
She was very angry.

56:08.760 --> 56:10.350
She made it perfectly clear

56:10.430 --> 56:14.990
she didn't want me or her stepfather

56:15.070 --> 56:17.830
involved in her life.

56:17.900 --> 56:21.400
Did you know that she
relocated to Los Angeles?

56:21.480 --> 56:23.740
I thought she might-

56:23.810 --> 56:26.180
go to Hollywood.

56:26.250 --> 56:27.940
She always spoke about wanting to be

56:28.010 --> 56:31.510
on TV when she was little.

56:31.590 --> 56:35.920
But you don't expect-

56:35.990 --> 56:41.450
and they're just dreams a child has.

56:41.530 --> 56:43.430
All right, just hang in for a minute?

57:17.831 --> 57:21.031
Krista Anne Kutcher
Last Known Adress
Silver Saddle Motel, 31613 Lavado Boulevard

57:21.200 --> 57:24.230
You gonna be around
town for another day?

57:24.300 --> 57:27.570
I was going to drive home-

57:27.640 --> 57:29.440
tomorrow but if you need me-

57:29.510 --> 57:33.340
Anything else we need, we can probably
take care of it over the phone.

57:35.310 --> 57:37.040
Okay.

57:45.560 --> 57:47.120
Okay.

58:09.950 --> 58:12.780
I... I was wondering if, um...

58:15.190 --> 58:18.640
if-if Krista Kutcher lived here.

58:18.720 --> 58:20.850
She did.

58:22.630 --> 58:25.190
I was hoping I could see her room.

58:25.260 --> 58:30.030
Somebody's in there.

58:30.100 --> 58:32.570
See the girl over there on the phone?

58:32.640 --> 58:36.510
If she wants to show
it to you, by my guest.

58:36.570 --> 58:39.770
Tommy, just come and get me.

58:39.840 --> 58:41.870
Who the fuck was that?

58:41.950 --> 58:45.540
Go fuck yourself, Tommy!

58:45.620 --> 58:48.070
Excuse me.

58:48.150 --> 58:49.210
Do I know you?

58:49.290 --> 58:53.250
I'm sorry, I just wanted, l-

58:53.320 --> 58:55.990
I spoke to the woman inside the office.

58:56.060 --> 59:00.120
I was wondering if I
could see your room.

59:20.750 --> 59:23.550
Did you know the girl
who used to live here?

59:23.620 --> 59:24.780
Yeah, I knew her.

59:27.290 --> 59:30.620
Were you friends?

59:30.690 --> 59:32.420
We lived together.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.800
It was a nice picture.

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:19.970
Yeah, she liked that one.

01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:35.550
What kind of things do they make you do?

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.150
What?

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.560
The men who pay you.

01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:46.330
You're asking me what I do on a date?

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.840
When you get paid.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:51.130
Yeah, thas a date.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.930
I don't know, whatever they want.

01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:56.480
Head, usually.

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:00.880
How much do they pay you?

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.040
You a reporter?

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.950
You want to do a story on me?

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:08.180
Les see, my mom's
dead. She was a junkie.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.190
She got shot in the
head in a parking lot.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.690
My dad, I never knew him.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.420
I grew up in East L.A.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:17.800
Now I suck off assholes for cash.
What do you think about that?

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:23.970
I think is sad.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.170
Yeah, well-

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:33.440
Did Krista ever tell
you where she came from?

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.450
Alá-wa-Washington, some
fucking place, I don't remember.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.960
Did she tell you why she ran away?

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:45.580
She probably wasn't happy.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.030
Did she tell you why?

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:52.160
Other than her stepfather sticking
his dick in her, I don't think so.

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:56.000
She probably thought "Fuck
it, I might as well get paid."

01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:58.330
Fucking mother was too much of a dishrag

01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:00.170
to do anything about
it, you know, typical.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.540
The husband or the kids, they
always choose the husband.

01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:03.940
Did she tell you that?

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:05.340
What?

01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:08.540
That her mother knew and-

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:09.670
chose him?

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:11.180
She probably liked it, right?

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:12.720
It took some of the load off.

01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:14.880
Like having one of your
kids help with the laundry.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.930
You're her mom?

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:23.010
I didn't know.

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:25.080
Okay.

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:33.100
I had no idea.

01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:34.790
Well now you know.

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:40.660
This has been really fun and
all but I gotta get to work.

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.710
Maybe I can take you to lunch.

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:46.470
I don't think so.

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:50.110
I'll pay you.

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:53.610
One time Krista went totally straight.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.020
No drugs, no hooking,

01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:56.680
she got a job at a nail salon.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.450
She was like a fucking Mormon.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.960
All she talked about was how she
wanted to get her shit together

01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:02.990
so that she could bring
her kid to live with us.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:06.620
And then, Del said that
she would have to pay extra

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.460
so Krista had three
jobs and she was working,

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:13.730
she was doing more drugs than ever
because she wanted to stay awake.

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:17.100
So she wound up getting nail polish
on this white lady's wedding ring.

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:19.610
I'm sorry, Krista had a child?

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.170
Yeah, so then she gets
fired from this nail place.

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:25.580
And she goes on this fucked up
drug mix like you wouldn't believe.

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:27.780
I didn't hear from
her for like two weeks.

01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:30.250
Is it a girl or a boy?

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.520
A girl.

01:04:32.590 --> 01:04:34.390
Ashley.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:36.520
She was really into that kid.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.260
Always sending her cards
and writing notes and shit.

01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:41.420
Even though the girl can't read.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.730
It was like she didn't want
her to grow up hating her.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.470
Where is she?

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:49.560
What?

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.230
Where? Where is she?

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:32.640
Hi.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.580
Come here.

01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:38.950
Hi, sweetheart.

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:43.590
Ashley.

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.990
Honey, look at me.

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:52.970
She wants money.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.840
I only have 200. Is that okay?

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:04.640
Give it to her.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.980
Here. Take it.

01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:19.460
Hi, Ashley. I'm your momma's momma.

01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:24.970
Do you want to come with me, honey?

01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:26.230
Okay.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.100
Maybe you can sit in the back with her.

01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.040
She really stinks.

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:32.440
She needs a bath.

01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:34.200
Yeah, with a fucking fire hose.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.210
Would you watch your language, please?

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.680
Shouldn't you be using
one of those baby seats?

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:41.720
Thas why I'm asking you
to sit in the back with her.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.450
You could get in an accident.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.280
You expect me to catch her?

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.260
Would it be better if
I just left her here?

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.660
Would that be better?

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:52.130
Whatever, man, I'm just saying.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.360
I don't even know how
I would find a car seat

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:57.870
around here, in this neighborhood.

01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:01.360
She's not my kid.

01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:04.870
I'll buy one tomorrow.

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:08.000
So are you gonna keep her?

01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:20.980
You are my sunshine My only sunshine

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:27.120
You make me happy When skies are gray

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.190
You'll never know, dear

01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:32.930
How much I love you

01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:42.240
You gonna keep her?

01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:46.680
I just need to know.

01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:48.910
Are you?

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:54.650
I guess thas something that I
have to discuss with the father.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.090
Good luck.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.090
It could have been a million guys.

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.630
I woulďve taken her.

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:05.430
I almost went and got her.

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:12.270
How am I supposed to
take care of her kid?

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.970
If you decide to take her, just-

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.979
take care of her.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:25.950
Did you love my daughter?

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:30.649
She tried to give me a necklace, and-

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:34.130
I didn't take it.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.290
I wanted to, and just couldn't.

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:19.029
You could wait a minute?

01:09:19.109 --> 01:09:21.200
Okay.

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:48.529
She said it made her look
how she wanted to feel.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.109
I live alone now.

01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:58.200
And if you want it, you
could come and stay with me.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.270
Get back on your feet.

01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:03.370
There couldn't be any drugs in my house

01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:06.380
thas something I just can't have but-

01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:10.080
if you want, you're welcome to stay.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.920
I don't think so.

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:22.360
Wait. Wait, wait!

01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:41.710
There is my address.

01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:45.020
Maybe, you could write me some time.

01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:49.320
"Awapaho, Washington."

01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:52.420
I knew it was something like that.

01:11:23.421 --> 01:11:28.021
THE DEAD GIRL

01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:36.470
Stop.

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.100
Get out!

01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:41.900
You're stupid.

01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:51.650
Aw, fuck.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.550
I'm sorry.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.060
That hurt!

01:11:58.130 --> 01:12:01.390
You know, thas not very nice.

01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:04.990
Whas the matter with
you? Get up off the floor!

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.370
What did you do this time?

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.430
Nothing.

01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:08.700
What did you do?

01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:10.400
I'm sick of this, we're going.

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.890
Nice.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.550
Fuck is that thing?

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:32.390
Shut up. Is for my kid.

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:36.690
Hey, you think you can give
me a ride out to Norwalk?

01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:38.390
No, I gotta get to work.

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:41.730
Not until tonight. Is
my kiďs birthday tomorrow.

01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:43.500
Just fucking FedEx it.

01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:45.940
We'll be back in time.
In like two hours.

01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:48.670
Do you think I want to haul
your ass out to fucking Norwalk?

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:49.800
Yes.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.350
Shit. Here.

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:55.510
Fuck. You gonna propose to me?

01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:59.080
Yeah, right. Open it.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.060
Take me to Norwalk and I'll blow you.

01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:03.960
You'll fucking blow me anyway.

01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:06.830
For free.

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.520
Open it.

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:19.840
I'd rather have a ride to Norwalk.

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:23.350
Just take the fucking necklace.

01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:43.090
Why are you eating your hair?

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:47.430
'Cause is delicious.

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.230
What does it taste like?

01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:56.570
...strawberry pop tarts.

01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:59.940
Do you know what? Cat butt.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.750
Do you know what? Turtle butt.

01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:07.880
Turtles don't have butts.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.120
Do you know what? You have a butt.

01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:17.390
Madison, come over here and sit by me.

01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:19.900
Hey, you making friends?

01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:21.460
Everywhere I go.

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:24.700
Come on, les go.

01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:29.400
How old is she?

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:33.040
Three and a half.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.280
I got a daughter. She's
gonna be three tomorrow.

01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:38.980
Is a great age.

01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:42.220
Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:55.630
You doing your multiplication tables?

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.570
When I was a kid,

01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.540
every birthday, we'd go
through the Sears catalog

01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:03.700
and pick out what we wanted.

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:06.270
I mean, we'd spend like days
looking through this thing.

01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:08.280
And look at each thing.

01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:12.150
To try and decide is that
the thing that I most wanted.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:18.280
So, there was this one year I decided
I wanted this ventriloquism doll.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:24.300
So I told my mom and I'm really
excited about this doll, right?

01:15:24.370 --> 01:15:28.700
So, is my birthday and
my mom puts this big box

01:15:28.770 --> 01:15:31.330
right in front of me
and I'm, like, "Cool".

01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:35.540
So I open it and she got
me this weird puppet thing,

01:15:35.610 --> 01:15:39.170
with strings and I felt sick.

01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:41.940
I tried to pretend that I was happy.

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:44.810
And it fucking went down
like that every year.

01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:46.480
I couldn't figure it out,

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:48.820
"Did I give her the wrong page?"

01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:53.120
No. No. I finally realize that my
fucking mother couldn't buy anything

01:15:53.190 --> 01:15:55.160
that wasn't on motherfucking sale.

01:15:55.230 --> 01:15:57.990
You go to a store to get
jeans and it didn't matter

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.060
which ones looked right,
which ones you wanted,

01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:03.860
you had to get the
ones that were on sale.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:06.500
Maybe thas why you're so fucked up.

01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:09.130
No, I just don't want my
kid growing up like that.

01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:11.400
I want her to get what she wants-

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.350
and not all the time
so she gets spoiled but-

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:18.650
sometimes. Sometimes-

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.240
you should just get the
thing that you really want.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.020
Like...

01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:25.790
on your actual birthday.

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:34.860
Jesus Christ.

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.500
I'll take you to fucking Norwalk.

01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:42.270
Yes, you're the best, man!

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:44.280
Oh, yes!

01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:45.940
Is that what you wanted?

01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:48.610
I don't know, I didn't have
a fucking Sears catalog.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.630
Now is gonna get in my way.

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:07.960
I don't care.

01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:09.800
I do, I don't wanna
have to wash it again.

01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:11.930
You're only supposed to
do it every three days.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.060
So don't wash it.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.940
Then I'll have your cum in my hair.

01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:18.640
Thas nice.

01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:21.080
Yeah, for the next guy.

01:17:21.150 --> 01:17:25.980
"Ooh, baby, you smell real nice."

01:17:28.981 --> 01:17:33.981
ASHLEY, MAMINKA TE MILUJE
A MOC POSTRÁDÁ, MILUJU TĚ

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:43.400
Fuck.

01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:45.370
Shit.

01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:52.070
I gotta go to work early,
some shis going down.

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:54.170
You said you'd take me to Norwalk.

01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:55.840
I don't have time to deal with that.

01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:57.310
You promised!

01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.110
I don't have time to
deal with your shit.

01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:00.510
Get your stuff and I'll drop you

01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:01.750
or find your own ride.

01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:04.450
You are such an asshole!

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.690
Give me the fucking bunny and
I'll drop it at FedEx tomorrow!

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.660
Tomorrow's her birthday!

01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:12.390
She'll get it the day
after her birthday.

01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:15.090
You are such a selfish asshole!

01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:16.360
Just get your shit.

01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:20.000
Give me my fucking money!

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:21.630
I need my fucking money!

01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:24.370
Here's your fucking
money! Get in the truck!

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:27.310
You are an asshole! You know that?

01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:29.680
Fuck!

01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:34.340
Suck your own fucking cock!

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:46.560
Get in, I'll drop you off at
the corner. Fuck you, bitch!

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.810
Can I borrow your bike?

01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:10.440
You got rent for me?

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.720
Is in the room, Del. Come
on, can I borrow it, please?

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:14.980
If ill start.

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.960
Thanks, man. You're the best.

01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:22.790
Bring it back in one piece.

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:23.860
See you later.

01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:45.680
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.580
What the fuck?

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.190
No, no. No, don't.

01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:56.820
Tell me, who did this?

01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:59.420
Who the fuck did this?

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.400
You could have killed that motherfucker.

01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:02.960
Did Tommy do this?

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.030
No.

01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:05.510
It wasn't Tommy?

01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:07.600
No.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:12.200
Tell me. Who was it?

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.250
Who was it?

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.750
This is nice.

01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:20.020
Yeah, I got this for you.

01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:22.220
Is got a real diamond in it.

01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:24.420
No, you should wear it,
it looks good on you.

01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:27.720
Is because of Tom, right?

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.460
I'm gonna fucking kick his ass.

01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:31.520
I'm gonna fucking
kill that motherfucker.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.370
No, you can't, stay with me.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.460
No, I can't, baby, I gotta go.

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:38.940
I gotta drop something off for my kid.

01:20:39.010 --> 01:20:42.030
I said I gotta go!

01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:50.520
Look, when I get back,
I'll fuck you, okay? Okay?

01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:52.110
I'll make you feel good, okay?

01:20:54.190 --> 01:20:56.650
You're so fucked up. Fuck this.

01:21:16.651 --> 01:21:21.651
ZKURVENEC

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:37.770
What the fuckin' bitch?

01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:39.990
Fuck you, fuck it, Tommy!

01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:42.430
Get up! Get the fuck up!

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.030
Get the fuck up!

01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:45.470
Let go of me!

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.530
Sometimes I think you
bitches like this shit.

01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:50.670
Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:55.610
Fucker! If you touch her
again, I'll fucking kill you!

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:59.640
Do you hear me? I will fucking kill you.

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:05.890
What the fuck are you
fucking cunts looking at?

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.220
Get out of my fucking face!

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.760
Motherfuckers!

01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:33.980
Shit.

01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:36.280
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you again.

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.950
You believe me, right, baby?

01:22:39.130 --> 01:22:41.090
We're gonna get out of here.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.220
Where are we gonna go?

01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:47.360
I don't know, some place
where there's trees and sky,

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:49.990
and you can breathe the fucking air.

01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:52.130
Someplace thas not so fucked up.

01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:56.540
We're gonna get my kid tomorrow
and we're gonna go, okay?

01:22:56.610 --> 01:23:03.040
Hello? Are you there?

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.640
Krista, I gotta go back to bed, okay?

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.880
Are you mad at me?

01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:11.720
Don't be mad at me
because I fucking love you.

01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:13.820
Do you love me?

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.760
Baby, can you just tell me you love me?

01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:22.390
I really need to hear it.

01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:25.440
I gotta go back to bed.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:31.740
Whatever. Um,

01:23:31.810 --> 01:23:35.510
I gotta go. I gotta go.

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.360
Fucker!

01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:48.580
Fucker.

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:51.120
Fucker.

01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:21.860
Do you know if they
got a FedEx around here?

01:24:21.930 --> 01:24:23.620
I don't know.

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:26.320
Even if they did, it would be closed.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.200
Shit.

01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:33.000
Hey, do you think you could
give me a ride to Norwalk?

01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:34.470
Where?

01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.630
Norwalk. I don't think
thas too far from here.

01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:39.840
Is that where you live?

01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:41.810
My daughter lives there.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:45.820
Tomorrow's her birthday.
Actually, is already today.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:49.290
She was born at 12:13 in the morning.

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:51.120
This...

01:24:51.190 --> 01:24:56.590
this was supposed to be for her but, um...

01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:58.600
I kinda fucked it up.

01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:05.030
I have to make a stop.

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:08.270
But then I could probably
take you to Norwalk.

01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:10.600
Really?

01:25:10.670 --> 01:25:13.700
God! This is so cool!

01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:18.910
Great, I could be
there when she wakes up.

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:23.480
I could bring her
chocolate chip pancakes.

01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:27.120
Having your own kid,

01:25:27.190 --> 01:25:29.680
is a pretty amazing thing.

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:33.790
You know, her father was
a real fucking asshole.

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.350
The whole time she was in me

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:38.030
I was afraid she would come
out looking like him but...

01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:40.930
she didn't.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.470
She looked just like me.

01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.410
A whole lot prettier.

01:26:10.570 --> 01:26:15.000
You are my sunshine

01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:20.100
My only sunshine

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:26.270
You make me happy

01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:30.720
When skies are gray

01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:34.880
You'll never know, dear

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:41.420
How much I love you

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.360
Please don't take

01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:49.500
My sunshine away
