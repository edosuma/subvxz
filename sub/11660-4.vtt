00:41.200 --> 00:48.033
(mellow music playing)

00:53.767 --> 00:54.867
Oh...

00:56.233 --> 01:00.033
Why is it they always schedule
the charity softball game

01:00.100 --> 01:01.734
on the hottest day of the year?

01:01.800 --> 01:06.934
I'm all hot and sweaty, I'm short
of breath, and I'm physically exhausted.

01:07.467 --> 01:09.533
You'd think I had a good time.

01:11.133 --> 01:12.400
You didn't have fun?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.767
I only enjoyed stealing second base.

01:15.834 --> 01:19.133
When have you not enjoyed
sliding under a man in uniform?

01:21.600 --> 01:24.166
It's hotter in here than it is outside.

01:24.734 --> 01:26.066
Oh, no!

01:26.700 --> 01:29.600
Of all days for the air conditioner
to break.

01:29.667 --> 01:31.033
We'd better call the repairman.

01:31.100 --> 01:34.567
-His number's in the kitchen.
-So is the ice cream.

01:34.633 --> 01:36.500
We'll have some while we're waiting.

01:48.266 --> 01:49.800
What are you doing?

01:49.867 --> 01:52.266
Giving the leftover meat loaf a thrill.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.767
What do you think?
It's hot as hell in here.

01:55.834 --> 01:59.100
-Close it before the food spoils.
-Ok.

02:01.367 --> 02:02.767
I meant
the refrigerator.

02:05.100 --> 02:08.100
-I'm going to call the repairman.
-I already did.

02:08.166 --> 02:10.834
He said he'd be here
three hours ago.

02:10.900 --> 02:13.834
Let's break out ice cream. What's this?

02:13.900 --> 02:15.767
I froze my underwear to stay cool.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.834
I'd lend you a pair, but on you,
I'm afraid they'd melt too fast.

02:23.433 --> 02:26.367
(gasps) I don't believe it!

02:27.133 --> 02:28.867
This is incredible news!

02:28.934 --> 02:32.734
I've been nominated for St. Olaf
woman of the year.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.567
That's nice.
Did the new <i>TV Guide</i> come yet?

02:36.400 --> 02:38.066
Blanche, you don't understand.

02:38.133 --> 02:41.333
In St. Olaf, this is
the highest honor there is.

02:41.767 --> 02:44.700
I never dreamed that someone
as unqualified as I am

02:44.767 --> 02:47.633
would ever be nominated
for anything so important.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.633
I guess Dan Quayle really
opened the floodgates.

02:56.266 --> 02:58.367
Last year, Gretchen Lilyhammer won

02:58.433 --> 03:01.734
for saving all the books
in the burning library.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.934
How did she do that?

03:04.000 --> 03:07.500
She took the three books
and ran like the dickens.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.767
Your library only has three books?

03:10.834 --> 03:13.200
What happens when a person's
read them all?

03:13.867 --> 03:16.600
I guess we'll cross that bridge
when we get to it.

03:18.166 --> 03:19.667
(knock on door)

03:20.166 --> 03:22.600
I'm going to write down my achievements.

03:23.066 --> 03:27.800
It doesn't matter whether I win.
Just being nominated is enough.

03:27.867 --> 03:30.867
-That's a good attitude.
-It's also a crock of bull.

03:30.934 --> 03:32.900
I want that sucker bad!

03:35.000 --> 03:37.066
This is Fred.
He's come to fix the air conditioner.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.734
This heat's driving me crazy!

03:39.800 --> 03:45.000
The old lady next door is running through
a sprinkler in her underwear.

03:45.066 --> 03:48.066
There's no old lady... Ma!

03:57.333 --> 04:00.367
This is unbearable.
It must be 110 in here.

04:00.433 --> 04:05.166
Here's a simple way to beat the heat.
Imagine yourself in a cool place.

04:05.934 --> 04:09.433
Like a snowy mountaintop in Colorado.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.300
With a ski instructor named Fritz.

04:17.066 --> 04:20.734
And a bearskin rug, a bottle of brandy,
and a crackling fire.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.367
It must be 120 in here!

04:26.233 --> 04:27.400
Morning, Rose.

04:31.066 --> 04:33.333
Dorothy, sometimes you can be so cruel.

04:36.233 --> 04:39.900
-Honey, what's the matter?
-Everything.

04:40.667 --> 04:44.500
I just found out
I'm the most boring person alive.

04:44.567 --> 04:46.533
Did something happen to Regis Philbin?

04:52.033 --> 04:53.233
No.

04:53.967 --> 04:57.734
I was listing my accomplishments.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.800
It wasn't till I saw them
in black and white

04:59.867 --> 05:03.300
that I realized my top accomplishments
aren't worth a damn.

05:03.367 --> 05:07.700
You're forgetting how much
you give to people.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.967
How about that work
at the counseling center?

05:10.033 --> 05:13.433
Honey, you must help
hundreds of people every year.

05:13.500 --> 05:17.834
-I just talk to them. Big deal.
-It is a big deal.

05:17.900 --> 05:22.033
A kind, loving word
helps a person in despair.

05:22.100 --> 05:25.667
That is your gift.
I wouldn't take it lightly.

05:25.734 --> 05:29.600
I haven't added anything to the world.

05:29.667 --> 05:32.600
Look, Rose, God doesn't make mistakes.

05:32.667 --> 05:35.266
We were all put on this planet
for a purpose.

05:36.133 --> 05:39.033
Blanche, you're here
to work in a museum...

05:39.367 --> 05:41.900
so that art can be
appreciated by humanity.

05:41.967 --> 05:46.367
Dorothy, you're here as a substitute
teacher to educate our youth.

05:46.433 --> 05:49.166
Rose, you're here because
the rhythm method

05:49.233 --> 05:51.033
was very popular in the twenties.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.433
Okay?

05:57.500 --> 05:59.233
I'm going to the movies. Goodbye.

06:02.633 --> 06:05.967
-I'm going to bed.
-Come on, you just got up.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.934
With my life, I won't miss anything.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.433
-Oh.
-I hate seeing her so upset.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.333
She can't judge herself.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.266
She can't see her accomplishments
like we can.

06:17.333 --> 06:21.367
Maybe all this resume needs
is a little punching up.

06:21.433 --> 06:25.533
Exaggerate the truth? Create colorful
stories just to impress people?

06:25.600 --> 06:27.767
-You can't do that.
-I know.

06:27.834 --> 06:29.367
That's my specialty.

06:31.166 --> 06:35.700
"Found a baby robin that fell out
of its tree and returned it to its nest."

06:35.767 --> 06:37.233
Make that a baby eagle.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.100
-Yeah.
-Eagle.

06:40.166 --> 06:44.533
-And it happened during a big rainstorm.
-Rainstorm.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.600
Which caused a mighty flood
which covered all the land.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.600
Oh, come on.

06:49.667 --> 06:53.133
Blanche, nobody in his right mind
is going to believe this story.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.133
-This is going to St. Olaf.
-"Which caused a mighty flood..."

06:57.667 --> 07:02.567
(serene music playing)

07:06.333 --> 07:08.734
-Honey, are you feeling better?
-A little.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.867
I tried this technique I read
about to cheer myself up.

07:11.934 --> 07:15.500
You stand in front of a mirror
and you tell yourself, "I love you".

07:15.567 --> 07:17.734
And then you give yourself
a great big hug.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.433
Yeah, my son Phil
used to do that all the time.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.500
Got to a point he couldn't pass a mirror
without saying, "I love you".

07:23.867 --> 07:27.166
I can't tell you how many times he got
punched out in the men's room.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.133
(doorbell rings)

07:36.700 --> 07:40.700
We're the St. Olaf woman of the year
blue ribbon panel. Rose Nylund?

07:40.767 --> 07:42.266
I'm Rose Nylund.

07:43.200 --> 07:47.467
-Aren't you fellas a little overdressed?
-I told you we didn't have to wear a tie.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.900
Allow us to introduce ourselves.

07:49.967 --> 07:53.066
I'm Len, this is Sven, and this is Ben.

07:53.533 --> 07:56.100
We are the topplekoffer triplets.

07:57.533 --> 08:00.133
How odd. You don't look anything alike.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.667
Back in St. Olaf,
nobody could tell us apart.

08:07.934 --> 08:12.200
You can imagine all the fun we had
playing tricks on our teachers.

08:13.166 --> 08:15.533
Which of you brothers
has custody of the brain?

08:18.300 --> 08:21.800
So what brings you guys to Miami?

08:22.800 --> 08:24.266
Wait a minute.

08:24.333 --> 08:28.500
I'll bet this has something to do
with the St. Olaf woman of the year award.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.233
-No wonder she's a finalist.
-Did I win?

08:32.300 --> 08:33.300
Not yet.

08:33.367 --> 08:36.900
A lot will depend on verifying the facts
in this here biography.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.800
(Rose) Oh, this is so exciting.

08:39.433 --> 08:42.400
Let me get us some refreshments
before we start.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.166
Please make yourself comfortable.
Sorry it's so hot.

08:46.233 --> 08:50.000
We're in the middle of a heat wave
with no air conditioning.

08:50.066 --> 08:51.066
Not necessarily.

08:51.133 --> 08:56.467
If Rose wins the award, you'll be flown
to St. Olaf to attend the ceremony.

08:56.533 --> 08:59.834
This year I was planning
to watch it on TV.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.900
You know, if all goes well
with this interview

09:04.967 --> 09:07.100
you can start packing right away.

09:07.166 --> 09:10.200
Oh, you know, I don't think
I'd bother Rose with an old interview.

09:10.266 --> 09:12.500
You know, you'd just embarrass her.
She's so modest.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.033
I'm sorry, but the rules state
we must conduct

09:15.100 --> 09:17.467
face to face interviews
with all the candidates.

09:18.734 --> 09:20.500
Here we are.

09:20.567 --> 09:23.166
I made some nice hot cocoa.

09:25.433 --> 09:29.200
Rose, tell us how you got up the courage
to save that eagle.

09:30.100 --> 09:31.734
It was just a bird.

09:31.800 --> 09:36.300
-What about saving that school bus?
-I just gave it directions.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.834
-A bridge was washed out ahead.
-Really?

09:40.467 --> 09:43.133
I can't take credit for those things.

09:43.200 --> 09:47.166
Rose, please.
Gentlemen, you're embarrassing her.

09:47.233 --> 09:52.934
The woman is a saint, and she's far too
modest to take credit for her good deeds.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.033
Do we have a winner here?

10:01.567 --> 10:02.633
Rose Nylund,

10:02.700 --> 10:05.133
you are St. Olaf's woman of the year!

10:05.200 --> 10:06.800
(all) Oof-dah!

10:16.934 --> 10:20.800
(calm music playing)

10:22.934 --> 10:26.967
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the fasten your seat belt sign is now off.</i>

10:27.667 --> 10:30.467
<i>If anyone can fix it,</i>
<i>please report to the flight attendant.</i>

10:38.166 --> 10:39.667
I don't get it.

10:39.734 --> 10:45.000
Why did we get off that lovely jetliner
and switch to this rickety old thing?

10:45.066 --> 10:47.800
Because big jets can't land
at St. Gustav.

10:47.867 --> 10:50.800
I thought we were flying to St. Olaf.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.133
St. Olaf doesn't have an airport.

10:53.467 --> 10:55.200
The only way to get to St. Olaf

10:55.266 --> 10:59.633
is to fly to St. Gustav
and take land transportation.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.500
Even the birds do it that way.

11:03.633 --> 11:05.200
I don't believe this!

11:05.266 --> 11:10.433
We could be going to beaver falls.
Beaver falls? That's my stop.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.000
(rings)

11:31.767 --> 11:34.967
I can't believe we're
on our way to St. Olaf.

11:35.734 --> 11:38.333
Oh, I'm so excited.
You girls will love it.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.834
But everybody thinks his
hometown is pretty special.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.133
I know I do.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.433
I'll never forget when I went back
after many years.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.200
Everything was the same.

11:48.266 --> 11:51.667
Garbage in the street...
prostitutes in the doorways...

11:52.834 --> 11:55.567
a couple of guys hanging from their heels
in the Town Square...

11:56.500 --> 11:58.767
oh, I can't go on. Got a handkerchief?

12:02.400 --> 12:06.700
Honey, why are you getting all teary?
Sicily sounds just awful.

12:06.767 --> 12:10.100
That wasn't Sicily.
That was my first apartment in Brooklyn.

12:11.700 --> 12:16.967
Well, the best part of this whole thing
is sharing the most important moment

12:17.033 --> 12:18.734
of your life with your best friends.

12:18.800 --> 12:22.066
We're happy you're getting
your little plaque.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.734
Blanche, it's more than a plaque.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.734
In St. Olaf, it's the highest honor.

12:28.467 --> 12:34.266
We all think of it as a reminder
that no matter how bad the world is,

12:34.333 --> 12:39.500
St. Olaf is still a place that's filled
with honest people leading honest lives.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.867
Well... we're just really proud of you,
Rose.

12:44.166 --> 12:49.100
I'm sure there's nobody who
deserves that award more than you do.

12:50.066 --> 12:51.900
<i>This is the captain speaking.</i>

12:52.000 --> 12:55.467
<i>We are beginning our descent</i>
<i>to St. Gustav airport.</i>

12:56.033 --> 12:57.967
<i>At least I think it's the airport.</i>

12:59.166 --> 13:02.400
Wow. In 20 minutes,
we'll be in St. Gustav.

13:02.467 --> 13:05.200
Then we'll hop on a train
for zumbro falls,

13:05.266 --> 13:07.133
and we'll grab the shuttle.

13:07.200 --> 13:11.166
We should be in St. Olaf
in a couple of days.

13:11.233 --> 13:12.900
(Sophia, Dorothy and Blanche) Days?

13:15.200 --> 13:21.767
(serene music playing)

13:26.800 --> 13:29.300
I will not forgive that airline
as long as I live!

13:29.367 --> 13:31.400
I cannot believe the airline lost
all our luggage.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.900
I'll have to go an entire weekend
without underwear.

13:33.967 --> 13:37.400
And you usually slip into a pair
by Sunday afternoon.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.967
Darn, I hate fog.

13:41.033 --> 13:43.467
Why? You've spent most
of your life in one.

13:44.367 --> 13:47.567
If it were clearer,
we could see Mount Losenbaden.

13:47.633 --> 13:49.133
What's Mount Losenbaden?

13:49.200 --> 13:52.667
It's like mount Rushmore,
except they sculpted four losers

13:52.734 --> 13:55.367
of presidential elections in
the mountainside.

13:55.667 --> 13:58.633
Let's see, there was Alf Landon,
Wendell Willkie,

13:58.700 --> 14:01.367
and Adlai Stevenson and Adlai Stevenson.

14:01.433 --> 14:04.867
-Why are there two Adlai Stevensons?
-Blanche, isn't it obvious?

14:04.934 --> 14:06.200
He lost twice.

14:07.533 --> 14:09.533
Oh, God. It's making sense.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.533
Oh, girls, come on.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.400
From the other side,
we'll see lake Losenbaden.

14:18.467 --> 14:20.600
-What's that in the shape of?
-A lake.

14:20.934 --> 14:24.000
-We'll stay.
-I'll go with you.

14:24.066 --> 14:27.200
I'm a sucker for natural beauty...
and a gin and tonic.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.800
Let's find the bar.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.600
Blanche, I'm glad we're alone.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.567
There's something we should do.

14:36.233 --> 14:39.333
I like you as a friend,
but I think I'll pass.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.934
-What?
-What did you mean?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.834
I think we have to tell Rose what we did.

14:49.900 --> 14:54.700
I agree. If they discover those lies
in her biography,

14:54.767 --> 14:57.433
she'll be the laughing stock of St. Olaf.

14:58.266 --> 15:02.400
We're about to go through
the zumbro falls tunnel.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.000
Rose, honey, listen.

15:04.066 --> 15:08.133
-We want to tell you--
-We could be in trouble.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.867
People have vanished off
the face of the earth

15:10.934 --> 15:13.800
-going through that tunnel.
-That's ridiculous.

15:13.867 --> 15:15.400
Hold on, here we go.

15:16.767 --> 15:19.567
(Blanche) Rose, listen.
It's about your biography.

15:19.633 --> 15:22.000
Um, there's something in there that, uh...

15:22.266 --> 15:24.800
well, what is the word I'm looking for?

15:25.266 --> 15:29.133
-I don't know exactly how to say this...
-Where's ma?

15:31.100 --> 15:34.500
Oh, my God, no.
The curse of the zumbro falls tunnel.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.166
-Sophia?
-Ma?

15:36.233 --> 15:37.367
(Sophia) What?

15:38.033 --> 15:40.367
Ma, where are you? Are you all right?

15:40.834 --> 15:43.033
(toilet flushes)

15:44.000 --> 15:45.266
(Sophia) I am now.

15:48.400 --> 15:53.433
(mellow music playing)

15:54.000 --> 15:57.166
I can't believe this is the shuttle
to St. Olaf.

15:59.900 --> 16:02.300
-How you doing, Ma?
-Fine.

16:02.867 --> 16:05.300
Sophia, why won't you sit here with us?

16:05.367 --> 16:07.633
After three days on
the road with you guys,

16:07.700 --> 16:09.667
this jackass smells better.

16:10.467 --> 16:11.567
Thank you.

16:14.533 --> 16:16.133
Look at that beautiful sky.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.066
That's one of the wonderful
things about being here.

16:19.133 --> 16:20.133
It is beautiful.

16:20.200 --> 16:23.867
It looks like you could touch those stars.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.367
I can't tell you how many
people in St. Olaf

16:26.433 --> 16:28.300
have fallen off their roofs trying.

16:33.934 --> 16:36.467
Rose, are we anywhere near St. Olaf?

16:36.767 --> 16:38.133
We're getting close.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.567
Look. There's the old tree house.

16:40.900 --> 16:45.600
As a kid, my best friend Ingrid and I
would go up there.

16:46.667 --> 16:50.000
Gosh, I miss her.
I haven't talked to her in ages.

16:50.066 --> 16:51.967
Why not give her a call?

16:52.867 --> 16:54.600
-Oh, maybe I will.
-Sure.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.500
Hey, Ingrid!

17:00.133 --> 17:01.734
(Ingrid) Is that you, Rose?

17:04.734 --> 17:06.433
Well, how are you?

17:07.700 --> 17:13.033
-Fine, Ingrid! How are you?
-(Ingrid) Oh, fine!

17:13.900 --> 17:17.734
Well, nice talking to you! Bye-bye, Rose!

17:18.400 --> 17:20.834
Bye, Ingrid!

17:22.333 --> 17:25.800
Oh, thank you, Blanche.
That was a great idea.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.166
It's great bringing two idiots closer
together.

17:29.967 --> 17:33.400
I think that's the motto
of the St. Olaf telephone company.

17:36.266 --> 17:37.734
I'm getting nervous.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.467
Just think, tomorrow I'll stand
in front of the entire town

17:41.533 --> 17:44.834
and be crowned St. Olaf woman of the year.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.967
Are you Rose Nylund?

17:47.834 --> 17:48.867
Yes.

17:48.934 --> 17:51.266
It's an honor to drive the woman

17:51.333 --> 17:55.033
that beat Emma Immerhoffer
for woman of the year.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.266
I beat Emma?

17:56.333 --> 17:58.600
Yeah. We thought she'd be a shoo-in,

17:58.667 --> 18:02.200
running the orphanage,
taking in the homeless...

18:02.734 --> 18:05.433
Emma did all that?
Oh, she's a saint.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.266
How did I beat her?

18:07.333 --> 18:11.533
Uh, Rose, there's something
we have to tell you.

18:12.266 --> 18:16.867
You see, what Blanche and I did
was, well...

18:16.934 --> 18:19.800
What Dorothy is trying to say
is we love you so much,

18:19.867 --> 18:22.233
and we wanted you to win so bad that...

18:22.834 --> 18:28.200
-we fudged some things on your biography.
-Fudged?

18:28.934 --> 18:31.266
Fudge makes it sound cute.
You lied.

18:31.333 --> 18:35.467
We embellished, Rose.
Rose, you do good things.

18:35.533 --> 18:39.000
You are the kindest,
most decent person we know.

18:39.066 --> 18:40.433
You deserve to win.

18:40.500 --> 18:44.600
But you lied.
I'm not doing this.

18:44.667 --> 18:47.266
I can't go back to my
hometown and do something

18:47.333 --> 18:51.667
that's against everything I stand for.
I'm telling them we're not coming.

18:51.734 --> 18:54.567
Driver, stop at the first phone.

18:54.633 --> 19:00.433
(calm music playing)

19:03.834 --> 19:06.100
Good morning.
Isn't it great to be home?

19:06.166 --> 19:11.333
I have an urge to kiss every piece
of furniture in the house.

19:11.867 --> 19:14.133
You wouldn't if you had dates
like other people.

19:19.066 --> 19:20.266
Oh, hi, Rose.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.800
Oh, Rose, come on.

19:22.867 --> 19:27.266
You're not still mad because we changed
your woman of the year application?

19:27.333 --> 19:32.500
I just hate it when you're mad at us
and get like this.

19:33.266 --> 19:36.533
-Okay. You're forgiven.
-That was easy.

19:37.166 --> 19:40.633
I thought it all over,
and you were just trying to help me.

19:40.700 --> 19:43.500
I can't stay mad at my best friends.

19:43.900 --> 19:47.500
After all, we've eaten over
500 cheesecakes together.

19:47.967 --> 19:51.000
Besides, you weren't raised in St. Olaf.

19:51.066 --> 19:54.400
It's not your fault you're
chronic two-faced liars.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.133
(man) Hello.

19:57.200 --> 20:02.200
Oh! Dr. Harry Weston.
And I'm not dressed, thank God.

20:03.800 --> 20:07.033
-Hi, neighbors. Welcome home.
-Hi, Dreyfuss.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.900
Hi, Harry. What brings you here?

20:10.800 --> 20:12.867
You called me and told me
you were here.

20:12.934 --> 20:18.266
-Remember you asked me to save your mail?
-Thank you, harry.

20:18.333 --> 20:21.300
You're about the sweetest thing
in my zip code.

20:21.367 --> 20:25.300
I don't know why I haven't had you...
to dinner.

20:26.233 --> 20:28.266
Well, that would be real nice.

20:28.333 --> 20:31.633
I've also been meaning
to talk about an examination.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.300
Blanche, I'm a pediatrician.

20:33.967 --> 20:35.734
Harry, I'm not sick.

20:37.533 --> 20:40.033
Well, I really have to go,
and so does Dreyfuss.

20:40.100 --> 20:43.100
That's why we're taking a walk.

20:43.700 --> 20:47.233
That's not what I mean.
I'll be walking, Dreyfuss will be going.

20:48.133 --> 20:51.700
-See you all. Come on, Dreyfuss.
-Bye, Dreyfuss.

20:51.767 --> 20:55.700
I know the prescription for me,
one of him every four hours.

20:56.633 --> 20:57.934
Is this for me?

20:58.567 --> 21:00.834
-It's from St. Olaf.
-Blanche.

21:01.333 --> 21:05.967
What was all that stuff with Harry?
The man hasn't dated since his wife died.

21:06.033 --> 21:08.467
You can't spend your whole life
in mourning,

21:08.533 --> 21:11.400
especially when you're
an eligible bachelor.

21:11.467 --> 21:15.333
In Sicily there's a simple rule,
if your husband dies, you wait 20 years

21:15.400 --> 21:17.100
or until you grow a mustache.

21:21.033 --> 21:25.033
Blanche, we all had an agreement,
no one dates Harry

21:25.100 --> 21:27.767
until an appropriate
amount of time has passed.

21:27.834 --> 21:29.600
I know, 18 months.

21:29.667 --> 21:33.000
I have it marked
on my calendar with a red circle.

21:33.367 --> 21:36.367
As of today, that man is in play.

21:37.166 --> 21:39.367
I'm just amazed
I was able to wait so long.

21:39.433 --> 21:43.066
He's so charming, sophisticated,
rich, and handsome.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.800
He fairly screams Blanche.

21:46.166 --> 21:48.000
At least he will
before I'm through with him.

21:50.433 --> 21:52.367
Girls, look.

21:52.433 --> 21:55.600
It's the St. Olaf woman
of the year trophy.

21:56.367 --> 22:01.834
It says I won after all because I embody
the values of truth and honesty

22:01.900 --> 22:03.900
which the award represents.

22:03.967 --> 22:05.967
What happened to Emma Immerhoffer?

22:06.033 --> 22:09.200
A skeleton in her closet disqualified her.

22:09.266 --> 22:11.200
-What was it?
-Mr. Immerhoffer.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.667
This thing isn't solid gold, is it?

22:16.734 --> 22:20.300
Oh, no. You peel off the foil,
and it's pure chocolate.

22:21.166 --> 22:25.100
That's the loveliest trophy
I've ever seen. I'll get a knife.

22:25.166 --> 22:30.266
-We can't tell you how proud we are.
-Sure, we can.

22:30.333 --> 22:34.967
Congratulations, Rose Nylund.
You are St. Olaf's woman of the year.

22:35.033 --> 22:37.567
(Sophia, Dorothy and Blanche)
Oof-dah!

22:44.000 --> 22:49.400
(theme music playing)
