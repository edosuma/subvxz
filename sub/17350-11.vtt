It's not that

-It's just that this is

-Why not?

If I hadn't taken action

02:53.233 --> 02:56.367
he could have accessed

What's the situation, John?

03:10.067 --> 03:12.933
The Central Air Traffic

has gone off-line.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.400
What do you mean,
"gone off-line"?

03:14.467 --> 03:17.267
I mean, it's disappeared.
Gone. No longer working.

03:17.333 --> 03:21.667
That means there's over
2,000 planes stuck in the air
with no way of landing safely.

03:21.733 --> 03:23.067
I'd say that's a problem.

03:23.067 --> 03:25.100

I need you to go to CATCH

-What's this?

03:41.900 --> 03:43.800

to reboot CATCH from here.

are hard to come by.

16:58.967 --> 17:03.833
The Tracys are truly fortunate
to have you to skulk
in the shadows for them,

17:03.900 --> 17:05.967
while they take to the sky.

17:06.067 --> 17:10.333
Why do you let them treat you
like a minion, Kayo?

17:10.400 --> 17:14.133
You have the skills and spirit
to lead, like me.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.533
You call this leading?

17:15.600 --> 17:19.767
You risked thousands of lives
just to cover a fuel theft?

17:19.833 --> 17:21.933
Not just a fuel theft.

17:22.067 --> 17:24.100
The greatest fuel theft
of all time.

17:24.167 --> 17:28.100
Alsterene is the cleanest,
most efficient,
combustible energy source

17:28.167 --> 17:30.333
that exists on our planet.

17:30.400 --> 17:36.067
This haul will allow me
to run my operation
for years to come.

17:36.100 --> 17:37.733
Not while I'm around.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.367
Why do you help
those that would hoard
the resources of the world?

17:41.433 --> 17:45.633
There are many that need
this fuel far more than the
rich companies that own it.

17:45.700 --> 17:49.100
Oh, I'm sure that your motives
are nothing but noble.

17:49.167 --> 17:52.467
You'd never sell
the stolen fuel
to the highest bidder.

17:52.533 --> 17:54.300
You're nothing
but a common thief.

17:54.367 --> 17:59.667
Am I? You may find, Kayo,
that things are not always
as they appear.

17:59.733 --> 18:03.167
-Enough talking.
-Yes, enough talking.

18:05.867 --> 18:09.367
There are only two kinds
of people in the world.

18:09.433 --> 18:13.800
Those who act
and those who react,
such as the Tracys.

18:13.867 --> 18:16.833
You are not one of them, Kayo.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.067
You know that.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.900
You and I are the same.

18:19.967 --> 18:21.233
We are bold.

18:21.300 --> 18:24.833
We see an opportunity
and we take it.

18:24.900 --> 18:26.167
You're right.

18:29.667 --> 18:30.700
What?

18:32.100 --> 18:34.067
Secure those tanks!

18:39.700 --> 18:40.733
(GRUNTS)

18:45.633 --> 18:48.900
Kayo, satellite is picking up
an explosion in your vicinity.

18:48.967 --> 18:50.733
Help is on the way. Sit tight.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.067
Too late, John.

18:52.067 --> 18:53.333
We might not get The Hood,

18:53.400 --> 18:56.233
but at least he won't get away
with the stolen fuel.

19:01.267 --> 19:05.700
BRAINS: Kayo, Thunderbird
Shadow wasn't designed
to take that kind of strain.

19:05.767 --> 19:07.567
KAYO: I'm not flying
them home, Brains.

19:07.633 --> 19:09.633
I just need
a nice soft landing.

19:12.900 --> 19:15.267
Come on, come on.
Just a little bit longer.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.333
You fool!

19:24.067 --> 19:25.767
I've been hit
with a disrupter!

19:29.300 --> 19:31.167
The tanks have separated!

19:33.500 --> 19:35.767
Hang in there, Kayo.
I'm on my way.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.867
My engines are out.

19:39.933 --> 19:41.400
Kayo, eject!

19:41.467 --> 19:42.567
(KAYO GROANING)

19:42.633 --> 19:44.600
Ejection controls
aren't responding.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.633
Kayo!

19:53.500 --> 19:55.800
I'm taking back what's mine.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.533
(ALARM BLARING)

20:50.667 --> 20:51.700
What are you doing?

20:51.767 --> 20:52.767
Why aren't you
going after him?

20:52.833 --> 20:55.467
People are the Thunderbirds'
priority, Kayo.

20:55.533 --> 20:56.700
(SCOFFS)

20:56.767 --> 20:59.633
The Hood could have just as
easily saved those tanks,

20:59.700 --> 21:01.367
but he saved you. Why?

21:01.433 --> 21:04.167
Don't ask me.
I'm just as surprised
as you are.

21:04.233 --> 21:06.100
I'm not happy about
the way you handled this.

21:06.167 --> 21:08.767
That's not the way
International Rescue
does things.

21:08.833 --> 21:12.067
Then maybe it's time
to change the way
things are done.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.600
Well, I'm just glad
you're okay.

21:18.667 --> 21:21.067
Looks like Brains has
his work cut out for him.

21:21.133 --> 21:23.067
I think you might
have fried the motor.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.733
It's for the best.
We wouldn't want Brains
to have nothing to do.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.667
-BRAINS: I heard that.
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)
