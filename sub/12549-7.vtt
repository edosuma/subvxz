WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.109
PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...

00:08.109 --> 00:09.040
COACH, YOU'RE GONNA
REPLACE BRANDON

00:09.040 --> 00:11.042
WITH A GUY WHO'S
BEEN HERE A DAY?

00:11.042 --> 00:12.613
- HE'S TAKING YOUR CLASS.
- YOU WANT ME TO KICK HIM
OUT OF THE CLASS?

00:12.613 --> 00:14.285
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT THE CLASS.

00:14.285 --> 00:17.218
- THEN WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
ON MY SIDE.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.121
- WHY ARE YOU BEING WEIRD?
- I JUST SAW THE WAY YOU WERE
LOOKING AT HIM AT FALL FEST.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.792
HE'S JUST A FRIEND.

00:21.792 --> 00:23.724
Lacey: DANNY,
I ALREADY TOLD YOU--
THAT KISS WAS A MISTAKE.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.327
HAVE YOU FOCUSED ON
ANYTHING BUT DANNY
SINCE HE GOT BACK?

00:26.327 --> 00:27.798
LIKE WHAT?
I HAVEN'T HAD
A JOB IN YEARS.

00:27.798 --> 00:29.130
WELL, MAYBE IT'S
TIME YOU GET ONE.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.132
THE NIGHT OF FALL FEST,
I SAW SOMETHING.

00:31.132 --> 00:34.034
IT WAS DANNY'S MOM.
I SAW HER THROW SOMETHING
INTO THE WATER.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.566
AND I THINK IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN A NECKLACE.

00:35.566 --> 00:37.708
Jo:
I FOUND A BUILDING DIRECTORY.

00:37.708 --> 00:40.371
Lacey: OH MY GOD. HOW COULD
VIKRAM HAVE SENT THAT CASH
AND NOTE? HE'S DEAD.

00:40.371 --> 00:42.042
HOW DO YOU THINK DANNY
WOULD REACT TO THIS?

00:42.042 --> 00:43.043
WE DIDN'T FIGURE OUT
ONE FREAKING THING.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.775
- I KNOW.
- TOTALLY SUCKS.

00:47.818 --> 00:49.650
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT A BIG
GAME THIS WEEKEND, BOYS.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.652
FAIRVIEW HIGH.
OKAY, THEY'RE TOUGH.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.654
I'M NOT GONNA
LIE TO YOU.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.055
BUT WE'RE TOUGHER.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.057
- AM I RIGHT?
- All: YEAH, COACH.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.789
- AM I RIGHT?
- All: YEAH!

00:58.789 --> 01:01.332
ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
NOW I'M GONNA SHIFT
THE LINEUP A LITTLE BIT.

01:01.332 --> 01:03.694
DESAI, I'M GONNA
TRY YOU AT DEFENSE.

01:03.694 --> 01:07.738
FARRELL, I'M GONNA MOVE YOU
TO DESAI'S SPOT AT FORWARD.

01:07.738 --> 01:09.170
WE'LL WORK ON THAT
AT PRACTICE TOMORROW.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.641
ALL RIGHT,
GOOD STUFF, GUYS.

01:10.641 --> 01:12.143
LET'S GO.

01:14.305 --> 01:16.747
DUDE, WHAT THE HELL?
YOU STEALING MY POSITION
WHEN I'M NOT LOOKING?

01:16.747 --> 01:18.549
I GUESS I JUST KNOW
HOW TO SWEET TALK COACH.

01:18.549 --> 01:20.651
BE CAREFUL.
I'LL TELL HIM WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT HIS HOT DAUGHTER.

01:20.651 --> 01:22.313
OOH.
( chuckles )

01:22.313 --> 01:23.454
YOU STILL DOWN FOR
OUR WORKOUT TOMORROW MORNING?

01:23.454 --> 01:24.585
YES. YES.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.656
- ALL RIGHT, 7:30?
- YEP.

01:25.656 --> 01:26.657
COOL.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.122
DEFENSE? A LITTLE LESS
GLORY FOR HIM, HUH?

01:31.122 --> 01:34.094
HE'S STILL STARTING,
ISN'T HE?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.466
HEY, YOU HUNGRY?

01:35.466 --> 01:37.128
YEAH,
FOR THOSE SEXY LIPS.

01:37.128 --> 01:39.400
ARCH, COME ON.
YOU'RE ALL SWEATY.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.633
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T REALIZE
I DISGUSTED YOU SO MUCH.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.104
Danny: HI, LACEY.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.177
YOU COME ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE TO WATCH ME
PRACTICE?

01:46.177 --> 01:48.379
- KEEP WALKING, FREAK.
- SORRY, CAPTAIN.

01:48.379 --> 01:50.681
I WAS JUST BEING
POLITE TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

01:50.681 --> 01:51.712
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO UPSET YOU.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.344
THAT IS SUCH B.S.

01:53.344 --> 01:55.786
YOU LIVE TO UPSET ME,
PSYCHO.

01:55.786 --> 01:57.117
ARCHIE, STOP IT.

01:59.450 --> 02:01.322
JUST-- IT'S ENOUGH.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.694
ENOUGH WITH THE "PSYCHO,"
AND THE "FREAK."

02:03.694 --> 02:05.856
IT'S ALL EXHAUSTING
AND KIND OF AWFUL.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.831
I'M GONNA GO WASH OFF.

02:12.603 --> 02:14.305
SO I'M NOT SO SWEATY.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.140
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.674
YEAH.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

02:38.229 --> 02:39.660
HEY.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.492
HEY, PRISONER.

02:41.492 --> 02:42.663
HOW'S LIFE BEHIND BARS?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.665
THRILLING.
HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.667
DRAINPIPE
AND THE WINDOW.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.300
A LOT HARDER TO DO
AT 16 THAN 10.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.641
( chuckles )

02:53.204 --> 02:55.706
SO HOW MUCH LONGER
ARE YOU UNDER LOCK
AND KEY?

02:55.706 --> 02:57.678
ONLY A FEW MORE DAYS.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.850
THOUGH IT'S UP TO
MY DAD, THE DICTATOR.

02:59.850 --> 03:00.951
JO, COME ON.

03:00.951 --> 03:02.713
YOU SNUCK OUT
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

03:02.713 --> 03:04.655
YOU KIND OF
ASKED FOR IT.

03:04.655 --> 03:06.817
IT JUST SUCKS WE WENT
ALL THE WAY TO CONNECTICUT,

03:06.817 --> 03:07.958
AND WE DIDN'T FIND
A FREAKING THING.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.821
YEAH.

03:10.821 --> 03:12.223
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT THOUGH.

03:12.223 --> 03:15.366
I KNOW.
I'M NOT WORRIED.

03:15.366 --> 03:19.199
AND HEY,
THE ROAD TRIP
WASN'T A TOTAL WASTE.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.871
AT LEAST YOU AND LACEY
BONDED, RIGHT?

03:20.871 --> 03:23.534
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

03:27.478 --> 03:29.980
JO MARIE MASTERSON,

03:29.980 --> 03:32.813
ARE YOU HIDING
SOMETHING FROM ME?

03:32.813 --> 03:35.986
WHAT?
NO, I'M NOT.

03:35.986 --> 03:37.818
COME ON.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.350
YOU CAN TELL ME.
WHAT IS IT?

03:39.350 --> 03:42.693
CAN YOU NOT GET
MY BED ALL SWEATY?

03:53.634 --> 03:54.635
BETTER?

03:57.808 --> 03:59.840
NOW WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?

04:01.572 --> 04:02.813
IS IT ABOUT YOU AND LACEY?

04:02.813 --> 04:05.516
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU GUYS AREN'T TELLING ME?

04:08.018 --> 04:10.821
IT'S NOT ME AND LACEY,
IT'S--

04:10.821 --> 04:12.923
IT'S ME.

04:12.923 --> 04:15.686
YOU?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.332
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

04:21.332 --> 04:23.334
SAY IT, JO.

04:23.334 --> 04:25.436
JUST...

04:25.436 --> 04:27.298
JUST SAY IT.

04:41.352 --> 04:43.814
OH, CRAP.

04:43.814 --> 04:45.816
( theme music playing )

04:53.824 --> 04:54.865
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

04:54.865 --> 04:57.398
YOU TOO. PILATES?

05:00.371 --> 05:01.902
DANNY, COME ON.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.704
YOU'VE BARELY SAID
A WORD TO ME IN DAYS.

05:03.704 --> 05:04.835
I JUST SAID "PILATES."

05:04.835 --> 05:06.877
DIDN'T I?

05:09.340 --> 05:10.381
WHAT'S LEFT TO SAY?

05:11.382 --> 05:12.413
I KNOW YOU'RE
STILL UPSET

05:12.413 --> 05:13.584
THAT I GOT RID OF
THAT NECKLACE, BUT--

05:13.584 --> 05:16.387
MOTHER, JUST LET IT GO.

05:16.387 --> 05:17.848
OKAY?
IT'S GONE.

05:17.848 --> 05:18.849
IT'S DONE.

05:18.849 --> 05:19.850
LET'S JUST
MOVE FORWARD.

05:23.694 --> 05:25.426
OKAY.

05:26.957 --> 05:28.659
FOR THE RECORD,

05:28.659 --> 05:31.902
I DON'T THINK
YOU KILLED THAT GIRL.

05:35.706 --> 05:37.368
ALL RIGHT.

05:37.368 --> 05:39.840
THANK YOU.

05:41.972 --> 05:44.375
SO, YOU'VE BEEN GOING IN
EARLY A LOT THIS WEEK.

05:44.375 --> 05:45.746
IS THAT THE TEAM?

05:45.746 --> 05:47.648
YEAH. ME AND ONE
OF THE OTHER GUYS

05:47.648 --> 05:49.780
HAVE BEEN SQUEEZING IN
EXTRA WORKOUTS.

05:49.780 --> 05:51.782
THAT'S GREAT.

05:51.782 --> 05:55.886
SO, PILATES THE ONLY THING
ON THE AGENDA TODAY?

05:55.886 --> 05:59.730
NO. ACTUALLY,
I HAVE A JOB INTERVIEW

05:59.730 --> 06:00.961
WITH BICKNER REALTY.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.594
GOOD LUCK.

06:03.594 --> 06:06.366
THANK YOU.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.900
HAVE A GOOD WORKOUT.

06:16.507 --> 06:17.848
I'M HEADING IN.

06:17.848 --> 06:19.850
I LEFT SOME EGGS ON THE STOVE
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY.

06:19.850 --> 06:22.513
I WAS JUST GONNA
MAKE SOME CEREAL,
BUT THANKS.

06:22.513 --> 06:25.115
SO,

06:25.115 --> 06:26.517
FIRST CLASS TODAY, RIGHT?

06:26.517 --> 06:28.388
CAN WE NOT
DO THIS, PLEASE?

06:28.388 --> 06:30.491
- DO WHAT?
- HAVE ANOTHER ARGUMENT

06:30.491 --> 06:32.062
ABOUT DANNY DESAI
TAKING MY CLASS.

06:32.062 --> 06:33.163
HE'S PAID.
IT'S DONE.

06:33.163 --> 06:34.164
LET'S MOVE ON.

06:34.164 --> 06:35.726
I HAVE MOVED ON.

06:35.726 --> 06:37.728
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO USED
THE "D" WORD.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.772
AM I INTERRUPTING
A MARITAL MOMENT?

06:41.772 --> 06:42.873
NOT AT ALL.

06:42.873 --> 06:44.074
HOME BY 5:00 TONIGHT,
RIGHT?

06:44.074 --> 06:46.477
ACTUALLY I HAVE
PSAT PREP TILL 10:00.

06:46.477 --> 06:47.978
REMEMBER? AT SCHOOL?

06:47.978 --> 06:51.111
WHAT, AM I TOO GROUNDED
TO BECOME A NATIONAL
MERIT SCHOLAR?

06:51.111 --> 06:52.943
FINE.
SCHOOL THEN HOME.

06:52.943 --> 06:54.485
GOT IT?

06:58.889 --> 07:00.851
( door opens, closes )

07:00.851 --> 07:02.953
HE'S GROUCHY.

07:02.953 --> 07:04.555
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS
ARGUING ABOUT?

07:04.555 --> 07:05.926
NOTHING.
WE'RE FINE.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.128
DROP THE ATTITUDE
WITH HIM, OKAY?

07:08.128 --> 07:10.200
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT
YOU RAN OFF WITHOUT
LETTING US KNOW.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.132
OR THAT YOU STILL REFUSE
TO TELL US WHERE YOU WENT
ALL NIGHT

07:12.132 --> 07:13.133
WITH DANNY AND LACEY.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.905
WE JUST--

07:14.905 --> 07:15.936
WE WENT FOR A DRIVE.

07:17.768 --> 07:19.710
OKAY. WHATEVER.

07:21.211 --> 07:24.745
MOM, WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT DANNY'S DAD?

07:26.677 --> 07:28.779
VIKRAM?
WHY ARE YOU ASKING?

07:28.779 --> 07:31.982
NO REASON.
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

07:34.184 --> 07:37.928
VIK WAS COMPLEX.

07:37.928 --> 07:39.630
BUT FUN.

07:39.630 --> 07:41.562
VERY OUTGOING.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.863
LIKE DANNY.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.464
THAT HELPFUL?

07:45.736 --> 07:47.738
SURE, YEAH.

07:47.738 --> 07:50.170
WHAT ABOUT
BEFORE HE DIED?

07:50.170 --> 07:53.904
LIKE IN THE MONTHS
BEFORE HIS ACCIDENT?

07:53.904 --> 07:55.776
WAS HE DIFFERENT?

07:58.008 --> 07:59.880
I WISH I KNEW.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.754
HE AND I DIDN'T TALK MUCH
THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HIS
LIFE.

08:03.754 --> 08:05.816
AFTER... EVERYTHING.

08:07.758 --> 08:10.891
GO ON. GO EAT YOUR EGGS
BEFORE THEY GET COLD.

08:13.864 --> 08:15.966
Sarita: WHY ARE YOU SUDDENLY
ASKING ALL THESE QUESTIONS
ABOUT REGINA?

08:15.966 --> 08:18.729
NO REASON. I WAS JUST
LOOKING THROUGH MY OLD
TEXTS LAST NIGHT.

08:18.729 --> 08:21.231
SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING
TO YOU GUYS ABOUT
A CONNECTICUT BOY TOY?

08:21.231 --> 08:25.235
I MEAN, SHE HAD LIKE SO MANY
BOYS TOYS, WHO COULD KEEP TRACK?

08:25.235 --> 08:27.808
LAKE HOUSE BOY TOY.
SUNGLASSES HUT BOY TOY.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.209
ICE DANCER BOY TOY.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.642
THAT LAST ONE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN JUST A FRIEND.

08:33.984 --> 08:35.586
WHAT?

08:35.586 --> 08:37.047
NOTHING.

08:37.047 --> 08:38.919
I JUST THOUGHT WE AGREED
NOT TO DRUDGE UP REGINA
STUFF ANYMORE.

08:40.891 --> 08:42.893
INCOMING.
MY BROTHER'S WALKING OVER.

08:42.893 --> 08:44.294
IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY,
F.Y.I.

08:44.294 --> 08:46.296
Tyler: SIS.

08:46.296 --> 08:49.600
TELL YOUR BEAUTIFUL FRIENDS
TO SING ME HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.931
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TYLER.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.733
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.735
MOM ALREADY MADE YOU
PANCAKES FOR BREAKFAST.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.867
EVERY MOMENT OF TODAY
DOESN'T HAVE TO REVOLVE
AROUND YOUR BIRTHDAY.

08:56.867 --> 09:00.040
PHOEBE'S JUST MAD BECAUSE
EVERY OTHER DAY REVOLVES
AROUND HER.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.311
TRUE STORY.

09:01.311 --> 09:03.974
- WHAT?
- TYLER, ANY BIG
PLANS FOR TONIGHT?

09:03.974 --> 09:05.746
YES, LACEY.
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.148
I'M HAVING MY ANNUAL
"DRINK WITH THE DEAD"
SOIREE

09:08.148 --> 09:09.650
AT GREEN GROVE CEMETERY.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.021
YOU GUYS ARE INVITED.

09:11.021 --> 09:12.082
OH.

09:12.082 --> 09:13.884
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN MAKE IT.
WE'RE BUSY.

09:13.884 --> 09:16.887
YEAH. I THINK
YOU'LL MAKE IT.

09:16.887 --> 09:18.829
LACEY, ARCHIE AND
HIS BUDDIES ARE INVITED.

09:18.829 --> 09:20.290
THE MORE, THE MERRIER.

09:20.290 --> 09:23.594
OH YEAH, AND BRING
THAT OTHER FRIEND
OF YOURS ALONG TOO.

09:23.594 --> 09:26.867
BLONDE, CURLY HAIR,
CUTE SMILE.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.038
JO.

09:28.038 --> 09:29.569
RIGHT?

09:29.569 --> 09:30.841
YOUR FRIEND?

09:30.841 --> 09:33.003
JO ISN'T MY FRIEND
ANYMORE, TYLER.

09:33.003 --> 09:35.075
I'VE SEEN YOU GUYS
THE PAST FEW DAYS

09:35.075 --> 09:37.678
WHISPERING IN THE HALLS
LIKE YOU'RE SPIES OR SOMETHING.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.879
NO. MUST HAVE BEEN
SOMEONE ELSE.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.051
Tyler: HMM. FINE.

09:41.051 --> 09:43.213
WHATEVER.
TILL TONIGHT.

09:51.061 --> 09:54.224
WELL, I COULDN'T DO IT.
THESE MORNING WORKOUTS
SOUND EXHAUSTING.

09:54.224 --> 09:55.896
YEAH, IF IT WEREN'T FOR COLE,
I'D PROBABLY GIVE UP

09:55.896 --> 09:57.227
AFTER FIVE MINUTES.

09:57.227 --> 09:59.129
BUT I THINK IT'S PAYING OFF.
CHECK IT OUT.

09:59.129 --> 10:00.130
WANT TO FEEL MY BICEP?

10:03.233 --> 10:07.237
WOW. BICEP-Y.

10:07.237 --> 10:09.079
I THOUGHT SOCCER
WAS A FOOT SPORT?

10:09.079 --> 10:11.181
THAT'S A FAIR POINT,
RICO.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.715
SO JO,

10:14.715 --> 10:17.217
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO LACEY LATELY?

10:17.217 --> 10:19.349
YEAH, SOME, I GUESS.
WHY?

10:19.349 --> 10:22.122
NOTHING. WE JUST HAVEN'T
ALL TALKED SINCE OUR ROAD TRIP.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.294
RICO, HAS JO CAUGHT YOU UP
ON ALL THAT CRAZINESS?

10:24.294 --> 10:27.157
OH, I'M ACTUALLY TAKING
A STEP BACK FROM ALL THAT STUFF.

10:27.157 --> 10:28.358
BUSY, YOU KNOW.

10:28.358 --> 10:30.761
PSAT, SCHOOL, LIFE,
ET CETERA.

10:32.903 --> 10:35.165
HAVE I DONE SOMETHING
TO UPSET YOU, RICO?

10:35.165 --> 10:38.769
HE'S REALLY NUTTY
ABOUT THE PSAT.

10:38.769 --> 10:41.111
WE'LL CATCH UP
WITH LACEY LATER.

10:41.111 --> 10:44.775
I THINK THAT SHE'S JUST
BEEN SPENDING MORE TIME
WITH ARCHIE LATELY.

10:46.777 --> 10:48.248
WELL...

10:48.248 --> 10:50.020
I HAVE TO GET
TO ENGLISH.

10:50.020 --> 10:51.782
THEN I HAVE TO
GO TO PRACTICE.

10:51.782 --> 10:53.784
AND THEN I HAVE ART
WITH YOUR MOM, ACTUALLY.

10:53.784 --> 10:55.726
HAVE FUN STUDYING
FOR THE PSAT.

10:55.726 --> 10:57.187
HAVE FUN WITH MY MOM.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.038
WHAT?

11:08.038 --> 11:10.440
I'M JUST WATCHING YOU
NOT HAVE A CRUSH ON DANNY.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.973
IT'S FASCINATING.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.776
FINE. YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.247
I HAVE--

11:17.247 --> 11:18.909
I HAVE A CRUSH ON DANNY.

11:18.909 --> 11:20.310
HOW COULD YOU HAVE
A CRUSH ON HIM?

11:20.310 --> 11:21.812
HIS BICEP WASN'T
EVEN THAT GOOD.

11:21.812 --> 11:23.784
YOU THINK I WANT TO
HAVE A CRUSH ON HIM?

11:23.784 --> 11:25.786
IT'S AWFUL.
PLEASE SNAP ME OUT OF IT.

11:25.786 --> 11:29.890
OKAY. I'M GONNA PLAY THE
"HE KILLED HIS AUNT" CARD.

11:31.261 --> 11:33.824
IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO.
AND HE HAD A REASON.

11:33.824 --> 11:34.995
REASON, RIGHT.
WHICH HE WON'T TELL YOU.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.798
UM, OKAY.
I'LL PLAY THE...

11:37.798 --> 11:40.230
"HE'S A SUSPECT IN
A MURDER INVESTIGATION."

11:40.230 --> 11:42.803
OKAY.
A MURDER HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.775
LOOK,
EVER SINCE HE'S COME BACK,

11:44.775 --> 11:45.906
HE'S ALL YOU'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.038
RIGHT? WHAT HE DID,
WHAT HE DIDN'T DO,

11:48.038 --> 11:49.439
WHAT HE KNOWS,
WHAT HE DOESN'T KNOW.

11:49.439 --> 11:50.981
HIS REASONS.
HIS HAIR.

11:50.981 --> 11:53.784
- I GET IT.
- MAYBE IF YOU JUST
STOP OBSESSING

11:53.784 --> 11:55.485
OVER ALL THE MYSTERIOUS
THINGS ABOUT HIM,

11:55.485 --> 11:57.918
YOU'LL GET OVER HIM.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.920
JUST MAKE HIM
A NORMAL PERSON AGAIN.

12:03.794 --> 12:06.927
Lacey:
JO, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

12:06.927 --> 12:10.230
I'M JUST WONDERING HOW
COMING HERE FITS INTO
MY SCHOOL

12:10.230 --> 12:11.461
AND HOME ONLY
PUNISHMENT.

12:11.461 --> 12:13.303
I KNOW IT'S A DRAG.

12:13.303 --> 12:14.935
BUT IF ARCHIE AND MY FRIENDS
KNEW I WAS HANGING OUT WITH
YOU AND DANNY--

12:14.935 --> 12:17.037
I GET IT, LACEY.
IT'S OKAY.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.942
OKAY, SO MY FRIENDS
WERE USELESS ABOUT
REGINA.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.443
YOUR MOM TELL YOU
ANYTHING ABOUT VIKRAM?

12:23.443 --> 12:25.976
UM, "CHARISMATIC"

12:25.976 --> 12:27.978
WAS ABOUT ALL THAT I
COULD GET OUT OF HER, SO...

12:29.279 --> 12:31.081
SEEMS LIKELY
HE GAVE REGINA

12:31.081 --> 12:32.052
THAT NECKLACE THOUGH,
RIGHT?

12:32.052 --> 12:33.523
MAYBE.

12:33.523 --> 12:35.055
BUT WHAT WERE THEY
DOING TOGETHER?

12:35.055 --> 12:37.227
YOU REALLY NEED ME
TO ANSWER THAT ONE, LACE?

12:37.227 --> 12:39.930
OKAY, BUT IF IT WAS
JUST SOME GROSS FLING,

12:39.930 --> 12:41.291
THEN WHO SENT
THE CASH AND NOTE?

12:41.291 --> 12:43.063
THE SECURITY GUARD SAID
THE PERSON IN THAT APARTMENT

12:43.063 --> 12:44.064
DIED MONTHS AGO.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.535
VIKRAM'S ACCIDENT WAS--

12:45.535 --> 12:47.537
MAYBE WHAT HAPPENED TO VIKRAM
WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

12:50.801 --> 12:52.943
WHAT IF REGINA
KNEW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

12:52.943 --> 12:55.806
WHOEVER SENT THAT CASH
COULD HAVE BEEN

12:55.806 --> 12:57.447
PAYING HER TO KEEP
QUIET ABOUT IT.

12:59.349 --> 13:01.311
OKAY, WE SHOULD JUST
TELL DANNY ABOUT ALL THIS
AND JUST SEE WHAT HE SAYS.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.314
JO, HE'S DOING WELL.

13:04.314 --> 13:06.786
IF HE KNEW ABOUT
HIS DAD AND REGINA--

13:06.786 --> 13:08.188
WHAT IF HE ALREADY KNOWS?

13:08.188 --> 13:11.962
I MEAN, THERE'S SO MUCH
THAT HE WON'T TELL US

13:11.962 --> 13:14.965
ABOUT HIS DAD,
THE NECKLACE, HIS AUNT.

13:14.965 --> 13:16.927
DID YOU EVER ASK HIM
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

13:16.927 --> 13:18.969
WHY HE DID IT?

13:18.969 --> 13:21.972
YEAH. HE JUST KEEPS SAYING
THAT HE'S PROTECTING ME.

13:21.972 --> 13:22.973
FROM WHAT?

13:22.973 --> 13:25.135
I DON'T KNOW.

13:25.135 --> 13:28.078
MAYBE ALL THESE THINGS
ARE SOMEHOW CONNECTED.

13:28.078 --> 13:30.040
YOU GUYS TOLD ME REGINA
SENT HIM THAT TEXT, RIGHT?

13:30.040 --> 13:32.282
SAYING THAT SHE KNEW
WHY HE KILLED TARA.

13:32.282 --> 13:33.543
YEAH, SO YOU'RE SAYING...?

13:33.543 --> 13:35.215
WHAT IF HIS REASON
FOR KILLING HIS AUNT

13:35.215 --> 13:37.948
IS SOMEHOW CONNECTED
TO WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

13:37.948 --> 13:40.090
I'M SICK OF THINKING
ABOUT WHY HE DID IT.

13:40.090 --> 13:42.292
OBSESSING OVER
EVERY DETAIL ABOUT HIM,

13:42.292 --> 13:44.124
HIS PAST.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.896
YOU SAID HE WON'T
TELL YOU.

13:47.597 --> 13:48.929
BUT HE MIGHT TELL YOU.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.932
( sighs )

13:52.933 --> 13:54.434
YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM,
LACEY.

14:07.577 --> 14:09.479
LAST TIME YOU TEXTED ME
FOR A SECRET MEETING,

14:09.479 --> 14:11.621
THINGS GOT A LITTLE--
A LITTLE INTENSE.

14:13.083 --> 14:15.125
DANNY, WE NEED TO TALK.

14:15.125 --> 14:18.228
YEAH, I AGREE.

14:18.228 --> 14:19.359
NOT ABOUT THAT.

14:21.892 --> 14:23.293
IT'S ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.

14:23.293 --> 14:26.566
THE 2008 ELECTION OF
BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA?

14:26.566 --> 14:29.069
IT WAS HISTORIC, LACE.
BUT WHAT'S LEFT TO SAY?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.541
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

14:31.541 --> 14:34.374
I WANT TO DISCUSS THAT DAY.
WHAT HAPPENED WITH TARA?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.545
NOW?

14:35.545 --> 14:36.947
RIGHT HERE?

14:36.947 --> 14:38.248
RIGHT HERE AT SCHOOL?
WHY? WHY NOW?

14:38.248 --> 14:39.449
WHY NOT NOW?

14:39.449 --> 14:41.081
GOD, LACEY, I--

14:41.081 --> 14:43.083
I CAN'T TAKE ALL THESE
MIXED SIGNALS.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.314
YOU STAND UP FOR ME
TO ARCHIE,

14:44.314 --> 14:45.916
AND THEN YOU AVOID ME.

14:45.916 --> 14:47.487
YOU KISS ME, THEN YOU SAY
YOU CAN'T DO IT AGAIN.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.419
YOU TEXT ME FOR SOME
SECRET MEETING,

14:49.419 --> 14:51.261
AND THEN YOU ASK ME
WEIRD QUESTIONS
ABOUT MY AUNT?

14:51.261 --> 14:52.322
IT'S NOT A WEIRD QUESTION.

14:52.322 --> 14:55.225
LACEY, THAT KISS...

14:55.225 --> 14:59.930
THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT.
ALL DAY, EVERY DAY.

14:59.930 --> 15:01.501
DON'T YOU
THINK ABOUT IT TOO?

15:01.501 --> 15:03.633
DANNY, I--

15:03.633 --> 15:05.535
YOU DON'T FEEL
THE SAME WAY?

15:09.109 --> 15:10.380
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

15:21.291 --> 15:23.293
( officers chattering )

15:24.554 --> 15:26.096
CHIEF?

15:26.096 --> 15:28.098
SO I TOLD MR. MASON
THAT WE'D STATION

15:28.098 --> 15:29.099
A PATROL CAR
OUTSIDE THE STORE

15:29.099 --> 15:30.230
IN CASE THE GUY
CAME BACK.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.231
GOOD.
KEEP ME UPDATED.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.402
WHERE ARE WE ON
McNALLY PARK?

15:32.402 --> 15:34.564
STILL CLOSED FOR RENOVATION.

15:34.564 --> 15:37.267
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH LONGER
WE CAN KEEP THAT UP

15:37.267 --> 15:38.268
BEFORE THE TOWN
GETS SUSPICIOUS.

15:38.268 --> 15:39.409
WE'VE COMBED THAT POND
TWO, THREE--

15:39.409 --> 15:41.241
COMB IT AGAIN.
THAT NECKLACE IS IN THERE.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.242
YOU SURE, CHIEF?

15:42.242 --> 15:44.144
MAYBE THE KID
GOT IT WRONG.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.545
HE WAS VERY SPECIFIC.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.677
WE HAVE TO FIND
THAT NECKLACE, EDDIE.

15:47.677 --> 15:49.980
IF I'M RIGHT THAT KAREN
IS COVERING FOR DANNY,

15:49.980 --> 15:51.651
THAT NECKLACE IMPLICATES
BOTH OF THEM.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.054
WHAT ABOUT GOING
STRAIGHT TO MRS. DESAI?

15:54.054 --> 15:55.385
SEEING IF SHE'LL TALK?

15:55.385 --> 15:57.457
MRS. DESAI AND I DON'T
EXACTLY SEND EACH OTHER

15:57.457 --> 15:58.588
CHRISTMAS CARDS
ANYMORE.

15:58.588 --> 16:01.461
BUT YOU TOLD ME THAT
THAT KID SAID

16:01.461 --> 16:03.063
SHE LOOKED UPSET
WHEN SHE THREW IT.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.535
IF YOU COULD JUST
WIN HER OVER,

16:05.535 --> 16:08.538
MAYBE SHE WOULD OPEN UP
TO YOU ABOUT IT.

16:08.538 --> 16:10.070
YOU ARE CHARMING.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.401
KIND OF.

16:11.401 --> 16:13.273
JUST KEEP AN EYE ON HER
FOR ME, EDDIE, WILL YOU?

16:13.273 --> 16:16.446
MAYBE I CAN TRY APPROACHING HER
ON MORE NEUTRAL GROUND.

16:21.251 --> 16:23.083
FOOD POISONING?

16:23.083 --> 16:25.455
INTENSE
FOOD POISONING.

16:25.455 --> 16:27.357
COLE'S PARENTS ARE
KEEPING ME UPDATED.

16:27.357 --> 16:28.718
LOOKS LIKE HE'S
GONNA BE OKAY.

16:28.718 --> 16:30.290
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE GAME TOMORROW?

16:30.290 --> 16:31.561
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

16:31.561 --> 16:33.163
HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL
ALL WEEKEND.

16:33.163 --> 16:34.764
DESAI, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE BACK TO FORWARD.

16:34.764 --> 16:35.725
YEAH.
OKAY, COACH.

16:35.725 --> 16:38.528
DESAI, WEREN'T YOU...

16:38.528 --> 16:40.030
WORKING OUT WITH HIM
THIS MORNING?

16:41.671 --> 16:43.573
I ONLY ASK BECAUSE
I'M CURIOUS HOW HE
SEEMED.

16:43.573 --> 16:47.207
HE SEEMED GOOD.
GREAT.

16:49.539 --> 16:51.541
OKAY, LISTEN.

16:51.541 --> 16:54.084
WE STILL GOT
A BIG GAME TOMORROW.

16:54.084 --> 16:55.585
NOW WE GOT TO WIN IT
FOR FARRELL.

16:55.585 --> 16:57.087
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S PRACTICE.

16:57.087 --> 16:58.418
COME ON. COME ON.

17:13.433 --> 17:14.604
( phone buzzing )

17:14.604 --> 17:16.706
HEY. HELLO?

17:16.706 --> 17:19.439
WHATEVER'S ON THAT PHONE
CAN'T BE MORE EXCITING
THAN THIS.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.670
YEAH, I'LL PUT
MONEY ON THAT.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.642
- ( phone buzzes )
- WHO'S TEXTING YOU?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.074
NO ONE.

17:25.515 --> 17:27.077
IT'S NOT DANNY.

17:27.077 --> 17:28.418
IT'S LACEY.

17:28.418 --> 17:30.820
SHE HAD A VERY FRUSTRATING
CONVERSATION WITH DANNY TODAY.

17:30.820 --> 17:33.553
SO IT'S STILL ABOUT DANNY.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.086
SHE TRIED GETTING HIM
TO OPEN UP HIS PAST,

17:36.086 --> 17:38.628
BUT SHE SAID HE JUST KEPT
SHUTTING HER DOWN.

17:38.628 --> 17:40.830
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA TRY
TO NOT OBSESS OVER HIM.

17:40.830 --> 17:42.492
THE ONLY WAY FOR ME
TO NOT OBSESS

17:42.492 --> 17:44.434
IS IF I FIGURE OUT
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM.

17:44.434 --> 17:47.097
OKAY, SO THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN STOP

17:47.097 --> 17:49.569
OBSESSING OVER HIM,
AND GET OVER YOUR CRUSH,

17:49.569 --> 17:52.342
IS TO INTENSELY
OBSESS OVER HIM

17:52.342 --> 17:54.574
UNTIL HE TELLS YOU STUFF
HE'S OBVIOUSLY NEVER
GONNA TELL YOU.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.346
YEAH.

17:56.346 --> 17:58.378
I'M TRYING TO PREP.
SO...

18:06.816 --> 18:09.719
WOW.
YOU'RE FAST.

18:09.719 --> 18:11.561
DO YOU GET POINTS
FOR SPEED IN ART?

18:11.561 --> 18:13.563
( chuckles )
NO.

18:13.563 --> 18:15.565
GOT IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:15.565 --> 18:17.567
IT'S GOOD.

18:17.567 --> 18:20.099
YOU COULD PROBABLY TEACH
YOUR MOM A THING OR TWO.

18:20.099 --> 18:24.103
( sighs )
I'M GLAD YOU GUYS ARE
FRIENDS AGAIN, BY THE WAY.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.705
YOU'RE A GOOD
INFLUENCE ON HER.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.578
MAYBE ONE DAY SHE AND I
WILL HAVE THE SAME RELATIONSHIP

18:28.578 --> 18:29.609
YOU AND JO HAVE.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.442
( sighs )
JO AND I AREN'T PERFECT.

18:32.442 --> 18:35.445
YEAH, BUT I MEAN,
SHE CAN TALK TO YOU.

18:35.445 --> 18:36.686
COME TO YOU
WITH A PROBLEM.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.290
I'M SURE YOU COULD
GO TO KAREN.

18:40.290 --> 18:42.552
EVEN IF IT WAS
ABOUT A GIRL?

18:42.552 --> 18:45.425
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW HOW
HELPFUL SHE'D BE.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.427
OR DISCREET
FOR THAT MATTER.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.399
( chuckles )

18:49.399 --> 18:51.561
THE GIRL'S NOT JO,
BY THE WAY.

18:51.561 --> 18:53.563
PROMISE.

18:53.563 --> 18:54.604
JO'S MY BEST FRIEND.

18:54.604 --> 18:56.906
( sighs )

18:56.906 --> 18:59.369
HAVE YOU TRIED TALKING
TO THIS PERSON?

18:59.369 --> 19:00.570
THIS GIRL?

19:00.570 --> 19:03.573
YEAH. VERY OPENLY.

19:03.573 --> 19:05.875
WELL, THERE'S NOT MUCH
ELSE YOU CAN DO.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.448
JUST BE THERE.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.381
BE AROUND HER.
SHOW HER YOU'RE
NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

19:11.381 --> 19:12.852
NO MATTER WHAT.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.354
BUT NOT IN
A STALKING WAY.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.785
GOT IT.
NO STALKING.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.330
( phone buzzes )

19:30.900 --> 19:32.442
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

19:32.442 --> 19:34.744
YOU THINK SOMEONE
DID THIS TO HIM
ON PURPOSE?

19:40.810 --> 19:42.752
I FOUND THIS IN
THE WEIGHT ROOM TRASH.

19:42.752 --> 19:44.754
NOW APPARENTLY,
A SMALL DOSE OF
THIS CRAP

19:44.754 --> 19:46.556
CAN MIMIC
FOOD POISONING.

19:46.556 --> 19:48.758
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
IN THERE WITH COLE
THIS MORNING.

19:48.758 --> 19:50.490
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS?

19:50.490 --> 19:52.792
NO NO. I DON'T.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.464
I WOULDN'T DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

19:54.464 --> 19:55.595
COLE, HE'S MY FRIEND.

19:57.727 --> 19:59.269
LOOK.

19:59.269 --> 20:01.601
I WANT TO GIVE YOU
THE BENEFIT OF THE
DOUBT HERE.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.373
BUT EVER SINCE WE
FOUND OUT ABOUT COLE,

20:03.373 --> 20:05.635
COACH LARSON AND I
HAVE BEEN GETTING
COMPLAINTS

20:05.635 --> 20:08.538
FROM YOUR TEAMMATES
ABOUT YOU.

20:08.538 --> 20:11.441
SO YOU CAN SEE HOW
YOU BEING ON THE TEAM

20:11.441 --> 20:12.642
IS CAUSING A PROBLEM.

20:12.642 --> 20:14.914
WHY-- WHY WOULD I
POISON COLE?

20:14.914 --> 20:17.787
AND THEN LEAVE THE EVIDENCE
RIGHT THERE IN THE TRASH

20:17.787 --> 20:19.619
FOR EVERYONE TO SEE.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.592
COME ON. SOMEONE'S OBVIOUSLY
TRYING TO SET ME UP HERE.

20:22.592 --> 20:25.295
MAYBE IT'S ARCHIE, OKAY?
HE HATES ME.

20:27.457 --> 20:29.459
PLEASE, JUST--
I DIDN'T DO THIS.

20:32.602 --> 20:34.464
LOOK.

20:34.464 --> 20:36.936
I THINK YOU'RE
A GOOD KID, DESAI.

20:36.936 --> 20:40.470
SO COACH LARSON
AND I HAVE AGREED

20:40.470 --> 20:42.612
THAT WE'RE GONNA
KEEP THIS UNDER WRAPS.

20:42.612 --> 20:44.944
NO NEED FOR THE TEAM,
OR THE SCHOOL FOR THAT MATTER,

20:44.944 --> 20:46.716
TO FREAK OUT ANY MORE.

20:46.716 --> 20:49.679
BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO TURN IN YOUR JERSEY.

20:49.679 --> 20:51.951
WHAT?

20:51.951 --> 20:53.783
ARE YOU DROPPING ME?

20:53.783 --> 20:56.926
I'LL SAY YOU HAD TO QUIT
FOR PERSONAL REASONS.

20:58.588 --> 21:01.561
BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO BOW OUT QUIETLY.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.334
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HIT
ANY MORE LEGAL TROUBLE,

21:04.334 --> 21:05.765
AND I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE MY JOB.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.936
I'M SORRY, DANNY.

21:21.611 --> 21:23.282
DANNY.

21:24.614 --> 21:25.815
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

21:25.815 --> 21:27.617
UM... NOTHING.

21:27.617 --> 21:29.619
IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE NOTHING.

21:29.619 --> 21:31.921
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

21:31.921 --> 21:33.493
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE AT MY MOM'S--

21:33.493 --> 21:35.325
JO, PLEASE.
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

21:35.325 --> 21:37.427
CAN WE JUST LET IT GO,
OKAY?

21:39.399 --> 21:40.770
CAN I HELP YOU?

21:40.770 --> 21:42.031
TYLER LEWIS.

21:42.031 --> 21:44.534
YOU'RE JO, RIGHT?
LACEY'S "FRIEND"?

21:44.534 --> 21:46.436
I'M NOT LACEY'S
FRIEND.

21:46.436 --> 21:47.937
HENCE THE AIR QUOTES.

21:47.937 --> 21:49.539
SOCIO.

21:49.539 --> 21:51.341
DUDE, WE HAVEN'T MET.

21:51.341 --> 21:52.782
I'M TYLER.

21:52.782 --> 21:54.344
WHAT IS UP?

21:54.344 --> 21:57.086
SO, JO, WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO RIGHT NOW?

21:57.086 --> 21:59.349
I'M HERE
FOR THE P.S.A.T. PREP.

21:59.349 --> 22:01.491
ISN'T THAT WHY
EVERYONE'S HERE?

22:01.491 --> 22:03.423
NO. ONLY THE COOL KIDS.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.954
I'M HERE FOR FILM CLUB.

22:04.954 --> 22:06.456
I'M KIND OF
THE PRESIDENT, SO...

22:06.456 --> 22:07.757
CONGRATULATIONS.

22:07.757 --> 22:09.629
CAN YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MINUTE?

22:09.629 --> 22:12.602
NOT UNTIL...

22:12.602 --> 22:14.564
YOU AGREE TO COME
TO MY BIRTHDAY TONIGHT.

22:14.564 --> 22:16.005
IT'S AT GREEN GROVE
CEMETERY.

22:16.005 --> 22:17.567
LACEY'S COMING.

22:17.567 --> 22:19.739
WELL, THANKS,
BUT I'M GROUNDED TONIGHT.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.070
WE'LL BE THERE.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.513
WHAT?

22:23.513 --> 22:25.615
IT SOUNDS LIKE A BLAST.

22:25.615 --> 22:28.347
SOCIO AT MY
CEMETERY PARTY.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.819
YOU CAN COME.

22:29.819 --> 22:31.451
BUT ONLY IF JO COMES.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.424
- Tyler: COOL?
- Rico: A CEMETERY PARTY?

22:34.424 --> 22:36.626
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

22:36.626 --> 22:37.957
WHAT-- NO BIG DEAL?

22:37.957 --> 22:39.358
THIS IS THE P.S.A.T.

22:40.430 --> 22:41.961
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE GROUNDED?

22:41.961 --> 22:44.363
I'LL BE BACK BEFORE
THE SESSION'S OVER.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.365
- NO ONE WILL EVEN
KNOW THAT I'M GONE.
- I'LL KNOW.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.097
I'M SORRY,
BUT I HAVE TO DO THIS.

22:48.097 --> 22:51.070
- WHY? FOR DANNY?
- I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
THIS UPSET.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.672
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.605
DON'T YOU GET IT?
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE
SOMETHING WRONG.

22:55.605 --> 22:57.607
ANOTHER SECRET,
ANOTHER MYSTERY
ABOUT HIM.

22:57.607 --> 22:59.078
WELL, I'M TRYING
TO GET PAST ALL THAT.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.010
I REALLY DON'T
THINK YOU ARE.

23:01.010 --> 23:02.782
I'M SORRY.
THIS IS NOT THE BEHAVIOR

23:02.782 --> 23:04.814
OF SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING
TO GET OVER A CRUSH.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.618
IF ANYONE ASKS, TELL THEM
I WENT TO THE BATHROOM, OKAY?

23:22.401 --> 23:23.903
Kyle:
CONNIE, HEY,
YOU GOT MY USUAL?

23:27.106 --> 23:28.938
IT'S A BIG DINER,
KYLE.

23:28.938 --> 23:31.080
I LIKE THE COUNTER.
COZY.

23:33.142 --> 23:35.114
THANK YOU, CONNIE.

23:38.087 --> 23:39.148
THAT'S YOUR USUAL?

23:39.148 --> 23:40.950
YEAH.

23:40.950 --> 23:42.191
HAM. CLASSIC.

23:42.191 --> 23:43.192
SO?

23:44.624 --> 23:46.095
NOTHING.

23:46.095 --> 23:47.627
IT'S EXCITING.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.999
I LIKE TO LIVE
ON THE EDGE.

23:56.105 --> 23:57.637
YOU OKAY, KAREN?

23:57.637 --> 23:58.708
YOU SEEM DOWN.

23:58.708 --> 24:01.170
OH, PLEASE.
LIKE YOU ACTUALLY CARE.

24:01.170 --> 24:02.211
OF COURSE I DO.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.546
I HAD A JOB INTERVIEW TODAY

24:06.546 --> 24:08.047
AT BICKNER REALTY.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.850
TURNS OUT NO ONE'S EXCITED
ABOUT HIRING A SINGLE MOTHER

24:10.850 --> 24:13.983
WITH A SPOTTY RESUME
AND A NOTORIOUS SON.

24:13.983 --> 24:15.485
GO FIGURE.

24:15.485 --> 24:16.986
YOU'RE BETTER OFF
ANYWAY.

24:16.986 --> 24:19.088
RAY BICKNER'S AN ASS.

24:19.088 --> 24:22.091
BESIDES, I HEAR HE CAN BE
A LITTLE INAPPROPRIATE

24:22.091 --> 24:23.963
AROUND THE OFFICE.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.635
WHATEVER.

24:25.635 --> 24:27.096
I CAN HANDLE
INAPPROPRIATE.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.239
I'M SURE YOU CAN.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.103
( laughing )

24:34.103 --> 24:36.105
IT'S JUST
I HATE CEMETERIES.

24:36.105 --> 24:38.648
THEY HAVE THIS WEIRD
CREEPY SMELL.

24:38.648 --> 24:40.109
I THINK IT'S
YOUR PERFUME.

24:40.109 --> 24:41.981
( both chuckle )

24:41.981 --> 24:43.653
YOU WANT ONE?

24:43.653 --> 24:44.684
NO.

24:46.115 --> 24:47.116
OKAY.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.661
WHAT, YOU'RE INSULTED
THAT I DON'T WANT
TO DRINK TONIGHT?

24:51.661 --> 24:53.993
WHAT'S WITH YOU?
YOU'VE BEEN REALLY
DISTANT LATELY.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.164
EVER SINCE FALL FEST.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.127
WHAT?
A PARTY FOR MOI?

24:58.127 --> 24:59.599
( cheering )

24:59.599 --> 25:00.600
( laughing )

25:03.072 --> 25:04.103
THANK YOU.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.977
HEY.

25:07.977 --> 25:09.779
WHAT THE HELL'S
HE DOING HERE?

25:12.041 --> 25:14.243
EVERY PARTY NEEDS
A SOCIO, RIGHT?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.146
THAT'S WHAT REGINA THOUGHT.

25:53.923 --> 25:55.254
SODA.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.326
YOU ARE A WILD ONE.

25:57.326 --> 25:58.658
I DON'T REALLY DRINK MUCH.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.331
YOU'RE AN ENIGMA,
JO MASTERSON.

26:02.331 --> 26:04.163
AN ENIGMA
I PLAN TO CRACK.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.835
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

26:10.099 --> 26:11.701
WHY DID YOU GUYS
COME HERE?

26:11.701 --> 26:13.272
I'M SORRY.
DANNY INSISTED.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.574
RATHER I LET HIM
WANDER OVER HERE ALONE?

26:19.709 --> 26:21.080
WHAT DID YOU EVEN
SAY TO HIM?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.782
EXACTLY WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.113
I BROUGHT UP
FIVE YEARS AGO

26:24.113 --> 26:25.655
AND HE WOULDN'T
TELL ME ANYTHING.

26:26.916 --> 26:28.587
( sighs )
WE SHOULD GO
TALK TO HIM.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.588
RIGHT NOW.
BOTH OF US.

26:31.060 --> 26:32.591
THERE WILL NEVER
BE A BETTER TIME.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.123
TRUST ME.
HE'S VULNERABLE.

26:39.669 --> 26:41.600
OKAY,
I'LL MEET YOU GUYS
AT THAT BIG CRYPT

26:41.600 --> 26:43.172
AT THE END OF THE ROAD
IN 20 MINUTES.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.635
OKAY.

26:51.280 --> 26:52.942
EASE OFF, DESAI.

26:52.942 --> 26:54.613
WE DON'T WANT YOU
HUNG-OVER

26:54.613 --> 26:56.115
FOR TOMORROW'S GAME.

26:56.115 --> 27:00.289
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK
PLAYING FORWARD AND ALL.

27:00.289 --> 27:03.723
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT
PLAYING ANYTHING.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.225
I QUIT
THE TEAM TODAY.

27:08.257 --> 27:09.328
WHAT, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

27:11.260 --> 27:13.402
WHY'D YOU QUIT?

27:13.402 --> 27:15.735
PERSONAL REASONS.

27:16.936 --> 27:17.937
HEY.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.709
LET'S GO FOR A WALK.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.424
BEST BLUEBERRY PIE
IN THE WORLD.

27:35.424 --> 27:39.188
LET'S NOT GET
CARRIED AWAY.

27:39.188 --> 27:41.430
JO LOVES THAT PIE.

27:41.430 --> 27:44.033
WHEN SHE WAS FOUR,
IT WAS ALL SHE WOULD EAT.

27:44.033 --> 27:46.966
I REMEMBER TESS
TALKING ABOUT THAT.

27:46.966 --> 27:50.399
TESS AND I CAME UP
WITH THIS ONCE-A-WEEK RULE.

27:50.399 --> 27:52.401
JO WAS PERSISTENT.

27:52.401 --> 27:54.443
PRETTY SOON IT WAS
TWICE A WEEK,

27:54.443 --> 27:57.947
THEN THREE TIMES,
AND BEFORE LONG
WE JUST GAVE UP.

27:57.947 --> 27:59.278
ONLY CHILDREN--

27:59.278 --> 28:01.680
WE SPOIL THEM.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.953
TESS AND I USED TO LIE
IN BED LAUGHING,

28:03.953 --> 28:06.285
ACCUSING EACH OTHER
OF BEING THE WEAK ONE.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.417
AND THEN IT BECAME
THIS GAME WE PLAYED:

28:08.417 --> 28:12.161
WHO WAS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE
TO JO'S MANIPULATIONS?

28:16.295 --> 28:18.968
I WAS ALWAYS
JEALOUS OF YOU TWO.

28:18.968 --> 28:20.970
YOUR MARRIAGE.

28:20.970 --> 28:23.302
VIKRAM AND I,
WE NEVER HAD THAT.

28:24.974 --> 28:27.476
YOU AND TESS HAVE THIS
AMAZING RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER.

28:27.476 --> 28:30.109
YOU ALWAYS FIND A WAY
TO SEE THINGS

28:30.109 --> 28:32.812
FROM THE OTHER'S
POINT OF VIEW.

28:32.812 --> 28:33.813
IT'S RARE.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.147
WOW.

28:38.147 --> 28:39.488
I GUESS YOU DO HAVE
A SOUL, KAREN.

28:41.951 --> 28:43.292
KISS MY ASS, KYLE.

28:46.395 --> 28:48.397
( dance music playing )

29:04.273 --> 29:05.444
I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN A HORROR FILM

29:05.444 --> 29:06.976
AND THIS IS THE PART
WHERE SOMEONE COMES

29:06.976 --> 29:08.317
AND JUST
BUTCHERS US ALL.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.420
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

29:11.420 --> 29:13.052
LACEY.

29:14.223 --> 29:15.785
DON'T BE THE FIRST
VICTIM.

29:15.785 --> 29:17.086
( chuckles )

29:17.086 --> 29:18.427
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

29:18.427 --> 29:20.189
I HAVE TO GO
CALL MY MOM.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.500
WHY DO WE HAVE
TO WAIT FOR LACEY?

29:31.500 --> 29:33.442
CAN YOU JUST TELL ME WHY
YOU DRAGGED ME OUT HERE?

29:33.442 --> 29:34.543
( sighs )

29:36.806 --> 29:39.008
HEY, SORRY.
HAD TO SNEAK AWAY.

29:39.008 --> 29:40.449
WON'T ARCHIE MISS YOU?

29:42.311 --> 29:43.452
OKAY.
SHOULD I START?

29:45.314 --> 29:46.986
OKAY, WHAT IN THE HELL
IS THIS ABOUT?

29:46.986 --> 29:48.357
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE,
DANNY.

29:48.357 --> 29:50.459
WE THINK YOU'VE BEEN
KEEPING TOO MANY
SECRETS FROM US.

29:50.459 --> 29:52.061
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU
CLEAR YOUR NAME,

29:52.061 --> 29:53.522
BUT THERE ARE
ALL THESE THINGS
WE DON'T KNOW.

29:53.522 --> 29:55.794
WE'VE BOTH TRIED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT IT BEFORE.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.066
BUT YOU JUST--
YOU CHANGE THE SUBJECTS.

29:57.066 --> 29:58.167
OR TELL JO
YOU'RE PROTECTING HER.

29:58.167 --> 30:00.299
OR EVADE US IN
A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.971
WOW.

30:01.971 --> 30:04.974
LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO
HAVE BEEN TRADING
WAR STORIES.

30:04.974 --> 30:08.237
SO WHAT IS THIS?
IS THIS AN INTERVENTION?

30:08.237 --> 30:09.808
DANNY,
IF YOU WANT OUR HELP,

30:09.808 --> 30:11.480
YOU HAVE TO STOP
HIDING THINGS FROM US.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.844
FINE.
WHICH SECRET DO YOU GUYS
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT FIRST?

30:14.844 --> 30:16.385
WAIT, HERE'S ONE.

30:16.385 --> 30:18.487
I GOT KICKED OFF
OF THE SOCCER TEAM TODAY.

30:20.589 --> 30:22.922
WAIT, IT GETS
EVEN MORE FUN.

30:22.922 --> 30:25.324
LACEY'S BOYFRIEND...

30:25.324 --> 30:27.556
FRAMED ME FOR POISONING
ANOTHER PLAYER.

30:27.556 --> 30:30.199
- ARCHIE W--
- WOULDN'T DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

30:30.199 --> 30:31.560
ARE YOU SURE, LACEY?

30:32.962 --> 30:34.133
DANNY, WE'RE--

30:36.465 --> 30:38.607
- I'M SORRY. THAT'S AWFUL.
- YEAH.

30:38.607 --> 30:42.311
- BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT SECRET WE MEAN.
- I CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT TARA.

30:42.311 --> 30:44.974
- YES, YOU CAN.
YOU CAN TRUST US.
- IT'S NOT ABOUT TRUST, LACEY.

30:44.974 --> 30:46.315
REGINA KNEW YOUR DAD.

30:48.617 --> 30:51.450
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- THAT APARTMENT...

30:51.450 --> 30:54.453
WHERE THE MONEY
AND THE NOTE CAME FROM?

30:56.155 --> 30:59.188
YOUR DAD WAS RENTING IT
BEFORE HE DIED.

30:59.188 --> 31:01.130
WE THINK THAT MAYBE

31:01.130 --> 31:03.462
HE AND REGINA
HAD SOMETHING GOING ON,
THAT MAYBE--

31:03.462 --> 31:05.264
MAYBE HIS DEATH
WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

31:05.264 --> 31:06.996
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM

31:06.996 --> 31:09.238
COULD BE CONNECTED
TO REGINA'S MURDER.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.203
NOW WHO'S
KEEPING SECRETS?

31:33.092 --> 31:34.423
DANNY, WAIT.

31:34.423 --> 31:36.095
DANNY.

31:36.095 --> 31:38.097
WE SHOULD HAVE
SAID SOMETHING.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.970
ABOUT YOUR DAD,
THE APARTMENT.

31:42.301 --> 31:45.034
- WE WERE JUST TRYING TO--
- PROTECT ME?

31:48.107 --> 31:50.309
AT LEAST WE TOLD YOU.

31:54.143 --> 31:56.115
MY DAD AND TARA,
THEY HATED EACH OTHER.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.316
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

31:58.317 --> 32:01.350
SOMETHING HAPPENED
WHEN THEY WERE KIDS.

32:01.350 --> 32:04.023
I HAD TO DO WHAT I DID.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.096
SHE WAS GOING
TO DESTROY MY FAMILY.

32:07.096 --> 32:10.259
- SHE WAS GOING
TO RUIN MY LIFE.
- HOW?

32:10.259 --> 32:12.501
SHE COULDN'T HAVE.
SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER--

32:12.501 --> 32:14.103
YES, SHE DID.

32:14.103 --> 32:15.564
TRUST ME.

32:17.967 --> 32:19.338
OKAY.

32:19.338 --> 32:22.441
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH WHY YOU WERE PROTECTING ME?

32:22.441 --> 32:24.173
DON'T MAKE ME
TELL YOU THAT.

32:26.645 --> 32:29.378
YOU'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT
PERSON IN THE WORLD TO ME.

32:33.122 --> 32:34.453
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

32:35.985 --> 32:37.126
SAFE.

32:37.126 --> 32:39.588
JUST LET ME
KEEP YOU SAFE.

32:40.990 --> 32:42.361
PLEASE.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.138
DO YOU THINK MY DAD
AND REGINA WERE...?

32:49.138 --> 32:51.470
ALL WE KNOW IS THAT ENVELOPE
CAME FROM HIS APARTMENT.

32:53.102 --> 32:54.343
WHO THE HELL
KNOWS WHO SENT IT.

32:54.343 --> 32:56.345
DID HE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?

32:57.346 --> 32:59.348
IN THE MONTHS
BEFORE HIS DEATH?

33:02.181 --> 33:03.752
HE STOPPED
VISITING ME IN JUVIE

33:03.752 --> 33:05.184
WAY BEFORE THEN.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.216
HE DID? WHY?

33:12.121 --> 33:14.593
BEING ON THE SOCCER TEAM,

33:14.593 --> 33:16.195
IT WAS--

33:19.468 --> 33:22.431
IT SORT OF WEIRDLY
MADE ME FEEL LIKE
HE WAS STILL HERE.

33:37.686 --> 33:39.648
SARITA.
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

33:39.648 --> 33:42.251
EVERYONE'S LEAVING.
HEADING OVER TO JOHNNY CAKES.

33:42.251 --> 33:44.453
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GET LEFT BEHIND.

33:44.453 --> 33:46.125
THANKS.

33:48.457 --> 33:50.129
LONG PHONE CALL
WITH YOUR MOM.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.131
OH YEAH, SHE'S BEEN
ON MY CASE LATELY.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.134
JOHNNY CAKES
SOUNDS GREAT.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.605
I JUST HAVE TO RUN BACK
TO SCHOOL REAL FAST.

33:56.605 --> 33:58.807
I FORGOT A BOOK I NEED.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

33:58.807 --> 34:02.141
I KNOW YOU
WERE WITH THEM.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.443
JO AND DANNY.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.545
IT'S OBVIOUS YOU'RE
HANGING OUT WITH THEM AGAIN.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.217
SARITA, NO, I'M NOT.

34:08.217 --> 34:09.648
I'M NOT GONNA
TELL ANYONE.

34:11.250 --> 34:14.083
BUT YOU CAN'T
HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE.

34:15.824 --> 34:17.386
US OR THEM?

34:30.799 --> 34:32.141
DANNY.

34:32.141 --> 34:33.802
HEY, WHERE'S JO?

34:33.802 --> 34:35.474
SHE HAD TO GET BACK.
CURFEW.

34:35.474 --> 34:36.745
OH.

34:43.682 --> 34:47.286
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO GET OVER THIS,
WILL I?

34:48.487 --> 34:50.819
WHAT I DID,
THIS DECISION,

34:50.819 --> 34:52.691
IT'S GONNA
FOLLOW ME FOREVER.

34:52.691 --> 34:54.463
I'M NEVER GONNA
HAVE A NORMAL LIFE.

34:54.463 --> 34:58.867
I'M NEVER GONNA
DO NORMAL THINGS.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.233
I'M NEVER REALLY
GONNA BE HAPPY.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.506
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

35:10.479 --> 35:12.141
WHY DID YOU
COME BACK HERE?

35:12.141 --> 35:15.184
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU WERE OKAY.

35:15.184 --> 35:17.286
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON.
THAT CAN'T BE THE ONLY REASON.

35:17.286 --> 35:18.587
WHY DID YOU COME BACK HERE?

35:19.818 --> 35:22.191
I'M SORRY YOU GOT
KICKED OFF THE TEAM.

35:23.852 --> 35:25.494
IF IT MATTERS,

35:25.494 --> 35:28.427
I DON'T THINK YOU
POISONED ANYONE.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.462
IT MATTERS.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.594
DANNY, I CAN'T.

36:05.594 --> 36:07.596
LACEY, PLEASE?

36:09.638 --> 36:11.840
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO GO.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.242
LACEY.

36:58.517 --> 36:59.488
HEY, BABE.

36:59.488 --> 37:00.949
IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

37:00.949 --> 37:03.722
ARCHIE, WE NEED TO TALK.

37:13.302 --> 37:14.363
HONEY?

37:15.434 --> 37:17.306
MOM, HEY.

37:17.306 --> 37:19.408
I GOT IN ONE MINUTE
BEFORE 10:00, SO...

37:20.669 --> 37:22.010
I BELIEVE YOU.

37:23.542 --> 37:24.543
YOU OKAY?

37:24.543 --> 37:27.015
MM-HMM.
HOW WAS YOUR CLASS?

37:27.015 --> 37:29.017
IT WAS GOOD.

37:29.017 --> 37:31.019
TOUGH THOUGH.

37:31.019 --> 37:33.021
TEACHING IS TOUGH.

37:33.021 --> 37:34.823
DANNY WAS
MY STAR PUPIL.

37:34.823 --> 37:37.826
( chuckles )
OR HE WOULD HAVE BEEN

37:37.826 --> 37:39.558
IF HE HADN'T
TAKEN OFF SO EARLY.

37:39.558 --> 37:41.360
SAID HIS COACH
NEEDED TO TALK TO HIM.

37:43.992 --> 37:45.033
EVERYTHING OKAY?

37:46.535 --> 37:48.437
YEAH. FINE.

37:48.437 --> 37:49.898
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

37:51.540 --> 37:53.442
NOTHING.
I'M ALL GOOD.

37:55.544 --> 37:57.376
IT'S JUST...

37:57.376 --> 37:59.007
JO.

37:59.007 --> 38:00.679
I'M YOUR MOM.

38:00.679 --> 38:03.011
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

38:03.011 --> 38:04.713
YOU KNOW THAT,
RIGHT?

38:07.556 --> 38:09.588
IT'S DANNY.

38:10.759 --> 38:11.760
WHAT ABOUT DANNY?

38:14.022 --> 38:18.026
I THINK THAT I HAVE--

38:18.026 --> 38:19.868
I LIKE HIM, MOM.

38:21.570 --> 38:24.002
OH.
( chuckles )

38:24.002 --> 38:26.004
WOW.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.006
JO, THAT'S--

38:28.006 --> 38:29.808
THAT'S TOTALLY NORMAL.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.782
YOU AND DANNY HAVE
BEEN THROUGH A LOT
OF INTENSE STUFF.

38:33.782 --> 38:37.085
IT'S NATURAL THAT YOU
MIGHT START TO DEVELOP
A LITTLE CRUSH.

38:37.085 --> 38:38.447
IT'S NOT A CRUSH.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.425
I THINK THAT I'M
IN LOVE WITH HIM.

38:49.698 --> 38:52.861
JO, THAT'S...

38:53.902 --> 38:55.434
ARE YOU SURE?

38:56.565 --> 38:58.707
I DON'T KNOW.

38:58.707 --> 39:01.339
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
SHOULD I TELL HIM?

39:03.041 --> 39:06.545
YOU AND DANNY--

39:06.545 --> 39:08.477
IT'S A COMPLICATED
SITUATION.

39:12.020 --> 39:13.682
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE CAREFUL.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.036
HI.

39:28.036 --> 39:29.868
I DIDN'T EVEN
HEAR YOU COME IN.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.039
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

39:32.070 --> 39:35.674
WELL, IT WAS--
IT WAS INTERESTING.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.676
( chuckles )

39:37.676 --> 39:39.648
HOW DID YOUR
JOB INTERVIEW GO?

39:39.648 --> 39:41.049
TERRIBLE.

39:41.049 --> 39:43.582
BUT...

39:43.582 --> 39:44.813
I GOT IT.

39:44.813 --> 39:46.054
MOTHER, THAT'S--

39:46.054 --> 39:47.886
CONGRATULATIONS.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.688
THANKS.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.990
- I GUESS IT MUST HAVE
NOT GONE TERRIBLY THEN.
- MAYBE.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.692
BUT ACCORDING
TO RAY BICKNER,

39:53.692 --> 39:55.123
I GOT A LAST MINUTE
RECOMMENDATION.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.667
KYLE MASTERSON.

39:58.667 --> 40:01.500
KYLE?
CHIEF MASTERSON?

40:01.500 --> 40:02.571
I'M AS STUNNED AS YOU.

40:06.034 --> 40:07.836
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST--

40:07.836 --> 40:10.579
I HAVE THIS FEELING
THAT, YOU KNOW,

40:10.579 --> 40:13.141
THINGS ARE
FINALLY LOOKING UP.

40:17.586 --> 40:20.719
MOTHER, CAN I--

40:20.719 --> 40:22.821
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

40:25.053 --> 40:26.725
IT'S ABOUT DAD.

40:26.725 --> 40:29.027
YEAH, OF COURSE.

40:29.027 --> 40:31.059
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

40:34.703 --> 40:36.565
NOTHING.

40:36.565 --> 40:37.706
UM...

40:37.706 --> 40:39.037
IT'S NOTHING.

40:40.569 --> 40:42.571
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT
ANOTHER TIME.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.672
NEED HELP
CLEANING UP?

41:13.672 --> 41:14.703
I'M ALMOST DONE.

41:16.705 --> 41:19.578
- BUT THANKS.
- SURE.

41:19.578 --> 41:21.580
JO MAKE IT BACK
ON TIME?

41:22.711 --> 41:24.783
THE PRISONER
IS IN HER CELL.

41:28.717 --> 41:29.988
TESS, I'M SORRY.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.590
KYLE--

41:31.590 --> 41:33.922
PLEASE,
JUST LET ME FINISH.

41:33.922 --> 41:35.724
YOU'RE A GREAT MOM.

41:35.724 --> 41:38.997
AND I'M SORRY IF I MADE YOU
FEEL LIKE ANYTHING LESS.

41:40.599 --> 41:41.730
YOU DIDN'T.

41:43.902 --> 41:46.605
I'VE BEEN
REALLY HARD ON YOU.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.076
YOU KIND OF HAVE.

41:48.076 --> 41:49.908
BUT I DESERVED IT.

41:54.042 --> 41:56.545
I'VE BEEN SO
WORRIED ABOUT HER.

41:56.545 --> 41:59.588
JO? DON'T BE.

41:59.588 --> 42:01.720
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF HER.
YOU AND ME.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.722
