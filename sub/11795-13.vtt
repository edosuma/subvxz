00:03.870 --> 00:06.773
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>

00:06.806 --> 00:09.676

00:09.709 --> 00:12.579

01:16.843 --> 01:19.879
   Zack! Zack! Zack!

01:21.548 --> 01:24.284
 Whoa!

01:24.317 --> 01:26.686
  Zack, you were so awesome
  at the track meet.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.955
 Oh... Kelly,

01:28.988 --> 01:31.324
come on,
you're making me blush.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.826
 Do it again.

01:34.794 --> 01:36.529
   Zack, l haven't seen
   you run that fast

01:36.563 --> 01:39.966
  since the time you stole
  Cindy
  Zefferelli's bathing suit.

01:41.968 --> 01:45.805
  Oh, Kel, come on!
  That was before us, Kelly.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.609
 Lisa, you were great
 in the 100-yard dash.

01:49.642 --> 01:51.878
Oh, thanks, but l owe
my victory to Screech.

01:51.911 --> 01:53.013
You do?

01:53.113 --> 01:56.383
 Oh yes, l pretended
 you were chasing me.

01:56.416 --> 01:58.752
I gotta hand it
to you, Preppie,
I've never seen anyone

01:58.785 --> 02:00.453
run the mile like you.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.522
 Hey, you guys,
 if we do this well on Friday,

02:02.555 --> 02:05.658
   we'll beat Valley
   and win the championship.

02:05.692 --> 02:08.061
 Let's celebrate.
 Burgers and shakes all around.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.963
   Oh, l can't stay.

02:10.062 --> 02:12.332
  I've got to finish my family
  tree presentation
  for class, tomorrow.

02:12.365 --> 02:13.767
 Well, what did you find out?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.869
My great-great-great-great-
grandfather

02:15.902 --> 02:19.739
  - was a slave
  in the Old South.
  -Oh, no, that's terrible.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.641
  I know,
  but fortunately he escaped,

02:21.675 --> 02:23.743
 and went back,
 and helped
 other slaves escape.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.378
   He must have been
   a very brave man.

02:25.412 --> 02:28.615
 My great-grandfather
was brave too.
 He was a bullfighter.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.817
   - Zack: That's cool.
   - Nah,
   bullfighting is barbaric.

02:30.850 --> 02:33.520
No it isn't,
bullfighting's a sport.

02:33.553 --> 02:38.091
 It would only be a sport
 if the bull had a sword, too.

02:38.091 --> 02:41.895
  - What were your ancestors,
  Jessie?
  - My ancestors?

02:41.928 --> 02:44.564
  Well, they're dead.

02:45.799 --> 02:49.703
Yeah, all of them.
They died
hundreds of years ago.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.105
That's so sad.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.575
  Zack,
  what about your ancestors?

02:55.608 --> 02:59.713
 My ancestors?
 Adam and Eve.

02:59.746 --> 03:03.650
   I didn't know Adam and Eve's
   last name was Morris.

03:06.619 --> 03:09.723
Look at the picture
of this Indian.

03:09.756 --> 03:12.425
  Looks like my Aunt Hannah,

03:12.459 --> 03:15.528
  except,
  she had thicker sideburns.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.430
   You know, l remember
   my mom telling me stories

03:17.464 --> 03:19.466
   about a distant
   Indian relative.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.735
   Oh, my mom tells me stories
   about four-eyed monsters

03:21.768 --> 03:23.803
 hiding in my closet.

03:25.572 --> 03:29.075
 She should see a doctor, Zack.
 They're not there.

03:31.077 --> 03:33.880
You know, l bet this Indian
could be my ancestor.

03:33.913 --> 03:36.616
 It's perfect for
 my family tree presentation.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.084
 And you can help me
 be an Indian.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.754
 - How?
 - That's a good start!

03:42.155 --> 03:44.891
...and after Abraham Turtle
escaped from slavery,

03:44.924 --> 03:48.094
 he became a conductor
 in the Underground Railroad.

03:48.094 --> 03:52.866
 They had subways
 during the Civil War?

03:52.899 --> 03:55.502
 Under the cloak of darkness,
 he helped sneak other slaves,

03:55.535 --> 03:58.104
 or "passengers" as they were
 secretly called, to freedom,

03:58.138 --> 04:01.174
   along this route
   from Atlanta to New York.

04:01.207 --> 04:05.045
 My family calls this
 Underground Railroad
 the original "Soul Train."

04:05.078 --> 04:06.880
  Thank you.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.581
Teacher: Good.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.450
   Discovering pride
   in our background

04:10.483 --> 04:12.819
 is part of what
 our assignment is all about,

04:12.852 --> 04:15.055
 I think Abraham
 would be proud of you today,

04:15.088 --> 04:18.591
 - you're getting an A.
 - Thanks!

04:18.625 --> 04:21.060
   Jessie,
   let's hear from you next.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.096
 Yes!

04:32.906 --> 04:34.908
   My ancestors were
   seafaring people.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.643
   They sailed around
   the world on ships.
   They were shippers, okay?

04:36.676 --> 04:39.079
   Thank you. I'm finished.

04:39.079 --> 04:42.182
  Jessie? Perhaps you could
  tell us a bit more.

04:42.215 --> 04:46.853
  Well, they shipped
  tea, spices, people,
  lumber, that kind of thing.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.188
People?

04:48.221 --> 04:50.890
  My ancestors shipped
  black people. Slaves, okay?

04:50.924 --> 04:53.193
   They were slave-traders.

04:53.226 --> 04:56.763
 Lisa, can you ever forgive me?
 I'm so ashamed.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.798
Jessie, you had
nothing to do with it.

04:58.832 --> 05:02.702
  Oh just say it. You hate me.
  Unleash those centuries
  of repressed anger.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.238
 - Jessie, you're being silly.
 - More, l can take it!

05:05.271 --> 05:07.107
 Thank you, Jessie,
 you can sit down now.

05:07.140 --> 05:11.244
  Oh see, now you hate me too!
  I can see it in your voice.

05:11.277 --> 05:13.580
(sighing)
My gosh, I'm losing it.

05:13.613 --> 05:15.582
  Calm down, Jessie.

05:15.615 --> 05:19.753
 We can all find
 things in our past
 that are unpleasant.

05:19.786 --> 05:23.590
   We can also learn
   from the mistakes
   of Jessie's forefathers.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.959
   Jessie had four fathers?

05:28.061 --> 05:30.864
That's four allowances.

05:30.897 --> 05:33.266
   All right. Zack Morris,
   let's hear from you next.

05:33.299 --> 05:36.569
 All right, Screech is going to
 assist me. Ready, Screech?

05:36.603 --> 05:39.139
   Ready, Kimosabe.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.645
After digging through
old family
papers and pictures...

05:47.147 --> 05:50.116
   I learned that
   I'm part American-Indian.

05:59.926 --> 06:04.297
  I come from
  a long line of fierce
  warriors and great hunters.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.099
   Me mean!

06:09.269 --> 06:13.106
 They roamed
 the wide open plains
 in search of their daily food.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.674
  Me hungry!

06:18.645 --> 06:21.948
  Whoa, Tonto,
  me got a question.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.250
 What's the name of your tribe?

06:26.653 --> 06:30.056
 - The Cherokee.
 - And where were they located?

06:30.056 --> 06:33.893
  They lived in the valley,
  but way far out...

06:33.927 --> 06:36.596
  past the freeway...

06:36.629 --> 06:38.765
   Burbank, l think.

06:38.798 --> 06:41.668
   - ( bell rings )
   - All right class,
   you're dismissed,

06:41.701 --> 06:45.071
  we'll continue on Friday.
  Zack, wait!

06:45.071 --> 06:47.107
 Yes, Miss Wentworth?

06:47.140 --> 06:50.810
   What you did was
   disrespectful to the class
   and to your ancestors.

06:50.844 --> 06:56.149
   I'm sorry. See, this picture
   is all l could find.

06:56.182 --> 06:59.119
 I'd like you to go and see
 a friend of mine,
 after school.

06:59.152 --> 07:02.022
  He'll help you
  get your research
  together by Friday.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.790
But l have
practice after school,

07:03.823 --> 07:06.192
 and the track championship
 is on Friday.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.661
  If you don't pass this class,
  Kimosabe,

07:08.695 --> 07:12.065
 the only place
 you'll be running
 is to summer school.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.239
 - Chief Henry?
 - Yeah.

07:19.272 --> 07:23.109
 Hi, I'm Zack Morris
 from Miss Wentworth's class.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.046
   The kid who thinks
   he's part Indian.

07:26.079 --> 07:30.884
 With that blond hair,
 you must be from some
 Malibu surfing tribe.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.687
Hang 10, dude.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.723
 You're supposed to be
 an Indian, why are you
 wearing a Dodger hat?

07:36.756 --> 07:39.926
   Because a Raider
   helmet's too hot.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.062
Where's that picture
you were gonna give me?

07:42.062 --> 07:44.764
   It's right here.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.267
 Oh, he's an Indian all right.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.670
 Come on, sit down. Let's rap.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.673
   I hate to rush
   you Chief Henry,
   but I really have to go.

07:53.707 --> 07:57.077
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 The bathroom is down the hall.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.778
 No, see, l have to
 finish this project,

07:58.812 --> 08:00.380
   so I can train
   for a track meet.

08:00.413 --> 08:03.016
  I thought you wanted
  to know all about this man.

08:03.016 --> 08:06.152
 Not all about him. Just enough
 for a three-minute speech.

08:06.186 --> 08:09.356
  I think I've got some stuff
  you can take home to read.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.825
   Oh great. Thanks!

08:13.026 --> 08:15.662
 Hey,
 this headband's pretty cool.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.097
  Did you learn to weave
  on the reservation?

08:17.130 --> 08:19.265
   No, UCLA.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.768
  Great Arts and
  Crafts department.

08:21.801 --> 08:24.738
Come here for a minute.

08:24.771 --> 08:27.307
 Here you go, these are good.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.043
 I love these.

08:30.076 --> 08:32.912
  And these are my favorites.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.081
 You did say
 a three-minute speech, right?

08:35.115 --> 08:37.150
Right!

08:41.855 --> 08:45.058
 Call me if you need any more.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.327
Mr. Belding, there's no way
l can get
through all this stuff

08:47.360 --> 08:49.963
 in three days and be ready
 for the track meet on Friday.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.331
You've got to be ready!

08:51.364 --> 08:53.266
  We haven't beaten Valley
  since I've been principal.

08:53.299 --> 08:56.770
   Well, if there was some way
   l could get an extension.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.873
   Look, I'm sure that
   Miss Wentworth will be
   a little more reasonable,

08:59.906 --> 09:02.809
   after I flex some
   principal muscle.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.277
 ( knocking on door )

09:04.310 --> 09:06.046
 Okay.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.855
 - Come in.
 - Mr. Belding... Zack?

09:16.823 --> 09:18.892
Miss Wentworth.

09:18.925 --> 09:20.460
I think that Zack
should get an extension

09:20.493 --> 09:23.096
  on his family tree project.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.297
   I don't!

09:24.330 --> 09:26.833
 Well, I'm glad
 you see it my way...

09:26.866 --> 09:28.168
  you don't?

09:28.201 --> 09:31.438
 Mr. Belding,
 Zack has to
 learn responsibility.

09:31.471 --> 09:35.909
   If he doesn't
   finish his project
   by Friday, he gets an F.

09:35.942 --> 09:40.180
   Aw, gee, Miss Wentworth,
   that's not fair.

09:40.213 --> 09:44.084
   He's had over 30 days,
   and it's still not done.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.219
  Is that true, Zack?

09:46.252 --> 09:49.889
Technically,
but only if you
count weekends.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.092
 You see, it's a technicality.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.561
   See, Zack is Bayside's
   only hope to win.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.964
 The better win for Zack
 is a solid education.

09:58.064 --> 10:02.035
  I'm sorry,
  no project, no track meet.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.476
Hi, guys.
How's it going?

10:09.509 --> 10:11.511
   Slow.
   How was practice?

10:11.544 --> 10:14.814
  Not good. Coach Neely
  was really mad
  you didn't show up.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.649
   He threw
   the shot-put at Belding.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.485
  Zack, if you don't finish
  this assignment,

10:18.518 --> 10:21.154
  we could lose
  the championship to Valley.

10:21.187 --> 10:23.123
  I'm trying my best.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.759
 Why doesn't that
 make me feel better?

10:25.792 --> 10:27.360
  Come on,
  let's let him work.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.728
   I'm gonna stay and help.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.764
Okay, let's go.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.900
 Lisa, let me buy you a soda
 to make up for my ancestors.

10:33.933 --> 10:36.369
  No thanks, I'm not thirsty.

10:36.403 --> 10:40.440
  - I am.
  - Who cares?
  You weren't a slave.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.443
  Are you hungry?
  How about a nice
  tossed green salad?

10:43.476 --> 10:45.512
 How about cooling it?

10:45.545 --> 10:47.414
I can't help it,
l feel guilty.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.382
  There must be
  something l can do.

10:49.416 --> 10:53.820
   Hey, tell her to wear
   a miniskirt to
   school tomorrow.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.289
Mind your own business,
bull-killer.

10:56.322 --> 11:00.927
 That's bullfighter,
 slave-trader.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.363
   All right,
   Jessie, there is one
   thing you can do for me,

11:03.396 --> 11:05.732
 I have not been
 to the mall in weeks.

11:05.765 --> 11:09.903
  I will take you there.
  I'll carry you on my back.

11:09.936 --> 11:14.841
 There's a picture...
 "Driving Miss Dizzy."

11:14.874 --> 11:18.778
 Look at this,
 my ancestor's picture
 is in this old history book.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.915
 Yeah, it says in here
 he was a famous chef.

11:21.948 --> 11:25.418
 Not a chef, you idiot.
 A chief!

11:28.722 --> 11:31.424
 ( knocking on door )

11:31.458 --> 11:34.461
  - Come on in, Running Zack.
  - Running Zack?

11:34.494 --> 11:38.264
It's your new name.
You run,
you're Zack, it works!

11:39.566 --> 11:42.469
Why didn't you tell me
my ancestor was
a famous chief?

11:42.502 --> 11:44.504
 You weren't ready to listen.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.673
  I know, but I'm ready now.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.808
 Darn,
 l was gonna go to the beach.

11:48.842 --> 11:52.245
  Please, Chief Henry,
  it would mean a lot to me.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.614
 All right, sit down.

11:56.616 --> 12:00.587
  You're not gonna find
  any of these
  stories in a book.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.223
 You see, your
 great-great-great-grandfather

12:03.256 --> 12:05.592
was a warrior
in the Nez Perce tribe,

12:05.625 --> 12:07.627
 under the mighty Chief Joseph.

12:07.660 --> 12:10.363
 - He was a brave man.
 - What was his name?

12:10.397 --> 12:12.499
   Whispering Wind.

12:12.532 --> 12:17.370
   And like the wind,
   his presence was strongly
   felt, but seldom heard.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.874
Now like you, Running Zack,
your people ran too.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.909
 Oh, not for trophies.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.612
  They ran to preserve
  their way of life,

12:25.645 --> 12:27.447
 which became harder and harder

12:27.480 --> 12:30.717
 when more of them were getting
 killed in battle
 with the white man.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.485
  This is such a big country.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.821
  Why couldn't the white man
  and the Indians get along?

12:34.854 --> 12:37.757
   Why can't the lion
   get along with the zebra?

12:37.791 --> 12:40.493
 Why can't the Arabs
 get along with the Israelis?

12:40.527 --> 12:44.330
  And why can't l get along
  with my ex-wife?

12:44.364 --> 12:46.466
   Come here, Running Zack.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.740
This is
a symbol of your tribe.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.010
  - Did you make this?
  - Last night.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.380
   I knew you'd be back.
   This is for you.

13:01.414 --> 13:02.949
For me?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.251
Thanks.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.722
 I guess you've got enough
 for your report now.

13:08.755 --> 13:12.058
  Yeah, l do, but I'd like
  to hear some more.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.060
Come on along.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.597
   I'll tell you
   how Whispering Wind
   helped save your people.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.836
  Buona sera.
  That means good afternoon.

13:22.869 --> 13:25.939
  I am the great-grandson
  of Luigi Powerelli,

13:25.972 --> 13:29.943
the dashing debonair
Italian lover and spy.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.914
Women the worldwide
found him irresistible.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.717
 I will demonstrate his charm.

13:41.421 --> 13:45.358
 - Buon giorno, baby.
 - Arrivederci, Dorky.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.996
   The Powerelli technique
   became legendary.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.365
  Women could not
  control themselves.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.967
Behold.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.603
 Signorina, I love you madly.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.105
   Get lost.

13:59.139 --> 14:03.043
I'll leave
a trail of breadcrumbs
so you can find me, eh?

14:03.043 --> 14:06.046
Mille grazie, Screech.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.516
 And thank you,
 my little pizza pie.

14:09.549 --> 14:13.787
 Oh, Screech, obviously you are
 a pepperoni off the old block.

14:13.820 --> 14:16.690
  - What is my grade?
  - You? A!

14:16.723 --> 14:18.692
  A!

14:21.828 --> 14:24.497
 Zack Morris, you're up next.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.832
 Zack?

14:25.865 --> 14:28.068
   Zack promised
   me he'd be ready.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.103
  And l believed him.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.608
  Great!
  There goes the track meet.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.878
   All right, class.
   Let Zack make
   his presentation.

14:41.081 --> 14:44.451
   My name is Running Zack.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.423
I am a direct descendant
of the Nez Perce tribe

14:50.457 --> 14:54.094
  who once lived peacefully
  in Oregon's Wallowa Valley.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.529
 My people were
 forced off their land

14:56.563 --> 14:59.432
 so settlers
 could mine for gold.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.668
   After fighting to
   keep their home,

15:01.701 --> 15:05.038
  the tribe,
  lead by Great Chief Joseph,

15:05.071 --> 15:08.341
  tried retreating
  to safety in the mountains,

15:08.375 --> 15:10.410
  but the Army pursued them.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.779
 Rather than
 watch his people die,

15:12.812 --> 15:16.116
   Chief Joseph surrendered.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.518
   He said,
   "I am tired of fighting.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.522
  Our chiefs are killed,
  our children are freezing,

15:22.555 --> 15:24.858
my people have no food.

15:24.891 --> 15:28.061
   My heart is sad.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.798
 From where the sun now stands

15:31.831 --> 15:34.668
 I will fight no more forever."

15:34.701 --> 15:36.870
   Miss Wentworth:
   Very good, Zack.

15:36.903 --> 15:40.507
  Very good.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.910
  Before this project,
  l knew nothing
  about my heritage.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.146
  I didn't even care.

15:46.179 --> 15:49.482
   Now I know and I'm proud.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.785
  - Congratulations.
  - ( class clapping )

15:51.818 --> 15:52.986
( bell rings )

15:53.086 --> 15:55.855
All right, class dismissed.
Thank you.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.662
 Well? How did he do?

16:02.696 --> 16:05.432
   Very well.
   He even dressed the part.

16:05.465 --> 16:09.903
   Zack has my blessing
   to go kick some Valley...

16:09.936 --> 16:11.604
   rear end!

16:11.638 --> 16:13.606
   Yes! Yes!

16:13.640 --> 16:15.775
  We are finally
  gonna cream Valley!

16:15.809 --> 16:18.445
   Zack, I love you!

16:19.946 --> 16:22.782
  I mean, I like you.

16:22.816 --> 16:26.886
I mean, job well done, son.
Keep up the good work.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.822
 Thanks, Mr. Belding.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.157
 Zack, we've gotta hurry,
 the pep rally
 starts in 10 minutes.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.126
 You go ahead, Kelly.
 I just want to
 call somebody first.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.528
  - Okay, I'll meet you there.
  - All right.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.231
 Lisa, why don't l carry
 your books to the pep rally?

16:38.264 --> 16:40.900
   Get away from me, Jessie.

16:40.934 --> 16:42.836
  At least, use my book bag.

16:42.869 --> 16:46.106
In fact, take it.
Free me of this burden.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.076
  Yes, hello.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.480
  I'd like to
  speak to Chief Henry.
  Tell him it's Running Zack.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.685
   What?
   ( flute playing )

17:08.627 --> 17:10.296
 Now welcome the captain
 of the track team...

17:10.329 --> 17:12.132
  AC Slater!

17:15.035 --> 17:18.538
  Thank you Mr. B.
  Now let's hear a big cheer,

17:18.570 --> 17:21.574
 for Bayside's fastest feet
 in the 100-yard dash,

17:21.608 --> 17:23.710
 Lisa "Flo-Jo" Turtle!

17:26.179 --> 17:28.882
  Lisa is the quickest girl
  on two feet.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.251
   With her on our side,
   we can't be beat.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.219
   Go, Lisa!

17:34.788 --> 17:36.823
   Thanks everyone,
   we're gonna win tomorrow,

17:36.856 --> 17:38.258
   and if my race is close,

17:38.291 --> 17:39.926
I have a little trick
I borrowed from Flo-Jo

17:39.959 --> 17:41.928
  to reach the tape quicker.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.064
   ( crowd laughs )

17:44.064 --> 17:45.899
Okay, thank you, Lisa.

17:45.932 --> 17:49.936
   Now here's Jessie Spano,
   my favorite quick chick!

17:53.273 --> 17:55.875
  Thank you, my favorite pig.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.046
This year is our
best chance ever
 to beat Valley.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.047
 We have a great team,

18:01.081 --> 18:03.283
 but here's a guy
 who can put us over the top,

18:03.316 --> 18:06.252
our new star in the mile...
Zack Morris!

18:10.890 --> 18:14.694
 Wow! Zack's so fast,
 I didn't even see him come in.

18:15.829 --> 18:18.098
 That's because
 he didn't show up, ya twink.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.800
 Let's hope he shows up
 at the finish line tomorrow.

18:20.834 --> 18:23.069
  The rally is too
  important to Zack,

18:23.103 --> 18:25.105
   something must be wrong.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.285
   Zack, I've been looking
   all over for you,

18:39.319 --> 18:41.855
 why didn't you come
 to the rally?

18:42.822 --> 18:45.125
   Kelly, he's gone.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.295
  A friend of ours
  passed away today.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.800
 Chief Henry died this morning.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.070
  Zack, I'm so sorry.

18:57.070 --> 19:00.840
   Is there anything
   l can do for you?

19:00.874 --> 19:05.078
 I don't know.
 No one close to me
 has ever died before.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.847
  It's hard sometimes, Zack.

19:07.881 --> 19:11.384
  But it helps to remember
  the good things he gave us.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.823
I just wish l
could've said goodbye.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.358
Me too.

19:19.059 --> 19:20.427
I gotta get outta here.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.295
  Zack,
  go home and get some rest.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.231
  I'll see you
  at the track meet tomorrow.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.069
  I'm sorry.

19:29.102 --> 19:31.171
 I can't run tomorrow.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.688
 Hey, Sleeping Zack, wake up!

19:52.058 --> 19:53.727
 What?

19:55.061 --> 19:56.296
  Chief Henry, you're alive?

19:56.329 --> 19:58.365
  No, I'm still dead.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.066
You know what?

20:00.000 --> 20:03.236
   Life is a lot less stressful
   when you're dead.

20:03.269 --> 20:04.804
   Why did you have to die?

20:04.838 --> 20:08.208
 Well, they don't give you
 much choice up there.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.376
Am I dead, too?

20:09.409 --> 20:11.144
   No, you're alive.

20:11.177 --> 20:14.948
 I'm just here in your dream.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.884
Hey, l never got to
tell you how my class
presentation went today.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.453
 I was watching.
 You got an A.

20:20.487 --> 20:23.823
Are you ready for
the big meet tomorrow?

20:23.857 --> 20:26.493
I hear Valley's
shaking in their Nikes.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.229
   I'm not running.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.965
  Ever since you died,
  it doesn't seem to matter.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.533
 Sounds like
 you've got a problem.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.002
( wristwatch beeping )

20:36.036 --> 20:37.537
  I gotta go.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.906
  I'm being fitted for wings.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.210
  Bye, Running Zack.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.480
  Goodbye, Chief. And thanks
  for all you've done for me.

20:47.514 --> 20:50.383
 Rest well tonight.
 And remember,

20:50.417 --> 20:53.987
 the answer to your problem
 is in your hands.

21:01.895 --> 21:05.065
 My hands?
 What about my hands?

21:16.242 --> 21:18.478
   Please, Lisa,
   the guilt won't go away.

21:18.511 --> 21:22.482
At least let me repave
your parent's driveway.

21:22.515 --> 21:26.186
  - I can do it in a weekend.
  - Jessie, stop already.

21:26.219 --> 21:28.555
 Lisa, l can't live with
 what my ancestors did to you.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.990
   All right! You wanna
   make it up to me?

21:31.091 --> 21:34.861
 I'll tell you what you can do,
 you can buy me a car.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.997
 - Buy you a car? That's crazy.
 - And so are you.

21:38.098 --> 21:41.935
   Now if you don't
   leave me alone,
   I'm gonna kick your butt.

21:46.306 --> 21:49.142
Are you guys fired up
to beat Valley?

21:50.643 --> 21:54.347
 All right, look, l know,
 we're short one man,

21:54.381 --> 21:57.517
  but you are
  the best track team
  that Bayside has ever had.

21:57.550 --> 22:00.220
I want you to go out there,
and do your best,

22:00.253 --> 22:03.490
  and Valley will regret
  that they showed up today.

22:03.523 --> 22:07.093
- ( cheering )
- Thank you, thank you.

22:07.127 --> 22:09.329
  - Zack, you made it.
  - Hi, Mr. Belding.

22:09.362 --> 22:12.332
  - Zack,
  what are you doing here?
  - I'm here to run the mile.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.100
I'm still on the team,
aren't l, sir?

22:14.134 --> 22:16.469
- Are you sure
you're all right?
- Much better now, sir.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.105
  I'm glad, son.
  Boy do we need you.

22:19.139 --> 22:20.874
 All right, everybody,
 let's go beat Valley!

22:20.907 --> 22:23.443
 Like, for sure!
 ( cheering )

22:30.083 --> 22:33.119
  Zack, what made you
  change your
  mind about running?

22:33.153 --> 22:36.289
  I got some good advice
  from an old friend.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.927
 Beat Valley.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.929
  This one's for you.

22:50.503 --> 22:53.106
 ( instrumental music plays )
