WEBVTT

00:05.657 --> 00:09.531
<i>Comes a time
in every hunt when the fightin'
starts.</i>

00:09.531 --> 00:11.881
<i>And the difference between
winning and losing</i>

00:11.881 --> 00:14.014
<i>isn't whether you have
the holy water,</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:16.712
<i>the wooden stake,
or the silver bullet.</i>

00:16.712 --> 00:21.064
<i>It's whether you've got
the grit to get the job done.</i>

00:21.064 --> 00:23.762
Nothing over here. You?

00:23.762 --> 00:26.722
Uh, copy. Same thing here.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.507
That tower doesn't look
like much.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.683
According
to Carlos' research,

00:31.683 --> 00:33.511
they've been bouncing signals
from radio towers

00:33.511 --> 00:35.861
all over the country,
some outside of it even,

00:35.861 --> 00:37.863
drawing in unicorn monsters
from everywhere.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.778
<i>To here in Lawrence.
We took out the monsters.</i>

00:39.778 --> 00:41.389
<i>The Akrida took their essence.</i>

00:41.389 --> 00:43.043
You really think the answers
to what the Akrida

00:43.043 --> 00:44.392
could be doing with
that essence are in there?

00:44.392 --> 00:46.350
There's only one way
to find out.

01:09.765 --> 01:10.983
Any idea who crashed
this party?

01:24.606 --> 01:26.999
It's my dad.

01:26.999 --> 01:30.133
His bag. It's covered in blood.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.151
Maybe we should try
jumper cables.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.631
Oh, I've tried that.

01:49.631 --> 01:52.286
I've done everything
I could think of.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.505
Potions, blood magic,
shock treatments,

01:54.505 --> 01:55.854
God, you name it.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.595
Nothing will get
that damn thing working.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.423
Okay, well, something has to.
All right? This box

01:59.423 --> 02:00.859
is literally the only thing
we have

02:00.859 --> 02:02.774
that can kill the Akrida.
- Carlos,

02:02.774 --> 02:05.037
I have looked through
every piece of lore we have.

02:05.037 --> 02:06.691
I mean, clearly
the Men of Letters wanted

02:06.691 --> 02:08.171
to keep their workings
a secret.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.955
Every secret comes
to light eventually.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.435
Ada, what did you find?

02:11.435 --> 02:12.958
The Men of Letters
mother lode.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.177
I thought you were helping
Tony get settled

02:14.177 --> 02:15.526
off the Akrida radar.

02:15.526 --> 02:17.049
Yeah, I got him safe
and sound.

02:17.049 --> 02:18.616
Then we started looking into
how to help Tony

02:18.616 --> 02:20.618
with his Djinn side,
which led into digging

02:20.618 --> 02:24.840
into the Men of Letters lore,
which then led to this.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.668
Turns out my son has a nose
for research.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.322
I knew we were
nerds of a feather.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.454
Tony found a shell company
listed as the owner

02:30.454 --> 02:32.848
of two of the offices
we've already investigated.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.458
The company owns one more
up in Michigan.

02:34.458 --> 02:35.981
I went to go check it out.

02:35.981 --> 02:37.505
It too was left for dead
just like the others.

02:37.505 --> 02:40.377
All of these abandoned offices.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.987
And what do you think happened
to the Men of Letters?

02:41.987 --> 02:44.903
Like, wiped out by monsters?
Retirement?

02:44.903 --> 02:46.470
I-I don't know.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.342
However they left,
they made sure

02:48.342 --> 02:51.693
to carefully guard everything
they left behind in Ann Arbor.

02:51.693 --> 02:54.652
They left a watchdog.
This time a werewolf.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.741
I took care of it,
grabbed everything,

02:56.741 --> 02:58.482
and came straight back
to Lawrence.

02:58.482 --> 03:01.311
The rest of it--
the rest of it is in my truck.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.530
There has to be
something in here

03:02.530 --> 03:04.009
about out buggy little friends.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.968
I'll got get the rest.

03:06.534 --> 03:07.709
He can't be gone.

03:07.709 --> 03:08.884
- We don't know.
- He can't be.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.364
- Mary--
- It's all my fault.

03:10.364 --> 03:11.887
I told my dad
I wanted to leave hunting,

03:11.887 --> 03:13.323
and ever since he's been
out here on his own.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.107
If I'd just kept
my stupid mouth shut...

03:30.558 --> 03:33.561
Took you idiots long enough.

03:34.910 --> 03:35.954
Hey!

03:37.260 --> 03:38.870
Who the hell are you?

03:38.870 --> 03:41.351
The body belongs
to Hector Salazar,

03:41.351 --> 03:42.700
but I'll give you three guesses

03:42.700 --> 03:44.963
as to who the mind
belongs to now.

03:44.963 --> 03:47.096
Akrida.

03:47.096 --> 03:48.576
Wow. Got it in one.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.578
Guess you're the brains
of the outfit.

03:52.754 --> 03:53.929
Where's Samuel Campbell?

03:53.929 --> 03:56.061
Oh, you mean Grumpy?

03:56.061 --> 03:58.412
Sorry, the man who captured, tortured,

03:58.412 --> 04:02.285
and was generally unpleasant
in both manner and odor

04:02.285 --> 04:04.635
was not exactly forthcoming
with the name,

04:04.635 --> 04:06.724
so I called him Grumpy.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.073
Samuel works too, I guess.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.641
What did you do with my dad?

04:10.641 --> 04:13.992
I'm just a worker bee, hon.
They don't tell us everything.

04:13.992 --> 04:16.647
I was left here to give you
a simple message.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.910
Our work here at the tower
is done.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.434
We have everything we need.

04:20.434 --> 04:22.827
All that sweet,
sweet monster essence

04:22.827 --> 04:24.394
is in our hands now.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.135
What's all that for?

04:26.135 --> 04:28.485
The queen, silly.

04:28.485 --> 04:31.271
Stand down, go home,
and enjoy

04:31.271 --> 04:34.099
whatever life
you have left to live.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.579
Tell me what your plan is.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.320
And tell me where my dad is
right now.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.280
I'm starting
to see the resemblance.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.933
I told you everything
you need to know.

04:41.933 --> 04:45.328
Nothing can stop what's coming.

04:45.328 --> 04:48.636
We got a box
that says different.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.333
That's not gonna do
a damn thing.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.769
Yeah, we'll see.

04:51.769 --> 04:55.686
Okay, you gave us the message.

04:55.686 --> 04:58.298
Let Hector go.
- No use now.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.170
Me being in here
has cooked through him.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.128
You humans are so soft.

05:03.128 --> 05:05.305
To be honest,
given what's coming

05:05.305 --> 05:10.222
for all of mankind, I'd say
ol' Hector here got off easy.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.486
Long live the queen.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.371
- Where are we?
- I'm still titrating

05:28.371 --> 05:29.981
the different essences,

05:29.981 --> 05:31.200
trying to find
the optimal blend for each.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.463
This magic is complex.

05:33.463 --> 05:36.161
Hmm.

05:36.161 --> 05:39.077
I thought we put you
in this flesh sack

05:39.077 --> 05:42.559
because he was good at this.
- He is.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.392
Now, I know
this won't hurt you,

05:49.392 --> 05:53.222
but I'm happy to go poke
your real body

05:53.222 --> 05:56.704
in all the right juicy places.

05:58.532 --> 06:01.622
Move faster.

06:04.451 --> 06:07.367
The dig has begun.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.282
It'll be ready. I promise.

06:10.282 --> 06:12.067
That's the spirit.

06:19.204 --> 06:23.383
Well...
if you're here that means

06:23.383 --> 06:25.776
our little friends found Hector.

06:28.779 --> 06:34.263
Do they now? Good.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.918
Time to make
a little trade then.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.752
If Dad is still alive,
he doesn't have much time.

06:44.752 --> 06:47.407
There was a lot of blood, Losi,
and not just on this bag.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.712
Mary, you act
like he hasn't lost

06:48.712 --> 06:50.410
a pint or two in his day.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.150
I found something.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.719
Our box has a name.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.808
They call it the Ostium.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.985
Oh. Latin for an opening
in the body.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.902
What, didn't any of you guys
ever go to Sunday School?

07:04.902 --> 07:08.079
So is that thing organic?

07:08.079 --> 07:11.082
Is it a mouth or...
any other kind of hole?

07:11.082 --> 07:14.564
Let's just stick
with a mouth, please.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.653
So this box eats monsters?

07:16.653 --> 07:18.307
I don't know.

07:18.307 --> 07:20.918
"Ostium" and a date
are printed on it,

07:20.918 --> 07:24.269
but the rest of the report is
filled with a bunch of files,

07:24.269 --> 07:27.142
and I can't make out
the handwriting.

07:27.142 --> 07:30.145
These notes were either written
by a doctor or a five-year-old.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.151
No, no, no, no.
This can't be right.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.893
- What is it?
- It's my dad's handwriting.

07:43.419 --> 07:46.291
- Can you read it?
- I don't know. I mean--

07:46.291 --> 07:48.685
Hey. Figure out what you can.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.600
My dad was staying
at a motel nearby,

07:50.600 --> 07:52.167
so I'm gonna head over there
and see what I can figure out.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.995
Oh. I-I'll drive.

07:55.431 --> 07:58.303
Let her go.
She needs to kick that tire

07:58.303 --> 08:00.001
and we need your eyes
on these pages.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.309
Okay, some of this
I-I can make out,

08:04.309 --> 08:07.487
but other parts, it's like
they're not even real words.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.315
That's because they're not.

08:10.315 --> 08:13.841
It's shorthand.
Like a court stenographer.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.799
I read something about it
in a Men of Letters book

08:15.799 --> 08:18.323
here at the clubhouse.

08:18.323 --> 08:20.891
A ledger that had
an abbreviation key.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.635
Your dad was an initiate.

08:25.635 --> 08:28.420
Part of paying his dues
was taking notes in meetings.

08:29.596 --> 08:32.337
With your eyes and Lata having
the key to the shorthand,

08:32.337 --> 08:33.730
maybe we can piece together

08:33.730 --> 08:35.384
what your dad was trying
to write about.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.738
I think I might know someone
who can read this

08:41.738 --> 08:44.524
faster than I can.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.048
I know what you're thinking
and you're wrong.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.919
You always think I'm wrong.

08:48.919 --> 08:52.357
And I'm usually right
about that, so listen to me.

08:52.357 --> 08:53.881
It's not your fault.

08:58.929 --> 09:02.454
I was gonna be a rock star, Mare.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.674
My mom and dad told me so.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.371
You see, I know you know
that ghouls killed my parents,

09:06.371 --> 09:07.677
but I never told you

09:07.677 --> 09:11.420
why they were in Phoenix
to begin with.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.074
I asked them for a new guitar.

09:13.074 --> 09:15.598
I begged them for it
for months.

09:15.598 --> 09:19.036
And I was relentless.
I mean, you can imagine.

09:19.036 --> 09:21.125
So they took a gig.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.736
It was a corporate party,
and they hated them,

09:22.736 --> 09:26.087
but the money was too good.

09:26.087 --> 09:29.307
So I went back to the motel,
and I waited.

09:29.307 --> 09:33.616
And I waited.

09:33.616 --> 09:37.098
But I never saw them again.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.581
Carlos, that isn't...

09:42.930 --> 09:44.975
Your fault.

09:44.975 --> 09:48.718
Yeah. I know that now.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.328
But it took me
a little while to realize

09:50.328 --> 09:53.114
that the only people
responsible for killing

09:53.114 --> 09:55.464
my parents were those ghouls.

10:01.296 --> 10:04.647
So how did you let go
of the guilt?

10:04.647 --> 10:06.040
I didn't.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.913
I'm sorry; I know
I'm supposed to rally you here,

10:09.913 --> 10:12.481
but we both know
that I am a terrible liar.

10:12.481 --> 10:15.658
How did you cope?

10:15.658 --> 10:18.313
By getting revenge.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.836
Tracked down the monsters
that killed my parents

10:19.836 --> 10:21.751
and erased all but two of them.

10:21.751 --> 10:25.059
I'll eventually find them.
But until then...

10:26.538 --> 10:28.279
We're gonna find the Akrida
and make them pay

10:28.279 --> 10:31.195
for even laying a finger
on your dad.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.505
It's part stenographer
shorthand and part...

10:36.505 --> 10:39.029
Code.

10:39.029 --> 10:42.293
Okay. This'll get us
halfway there.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.513
And we'll handle
the other half.

10:50.040 --> 10:54.175
I'll be damned.

10:54.175 --> 10:57.657
For a so-called Man of Letters,

10:57.657 --> 11:01.399
Henry never met a consonant
or a vowel he couldn't butcher.

11:01.399 --> 11:04.489
I could always read
your dad's writing

11:04.489 --> 11:07.188
because I knew the context--

11:07.188 --> 11:11.540
shopping lists, bills paid...

11:13.194 --> 11:14.674
Love letters.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.328
I don't think
we need to unpack--

11:17.328 --> 11:22.333
Hey. You asked me here.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.293
If I'm gonna help you,
I need to know what's going on.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.562
We're trying to save mankind.

11:33.562 --> 11:36.826
What?

11:36.826 --> 11:38.567
You're kidding, right?

11:45.182 --> 11:48.882
Your father's chicken scratch
is the key to saving the world?

11:48.882 --> 11:52.755
If you can decipher it,
then yes.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.587
Great. No pressure.

12:07.465 --> 12:10.294
Well, that was the cleanest
motel Dad's ever left behind.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.035
Probably wasn't there
that long.

12:12.035 --> 12:14.081
Thinking maybe we should double
back to the radio tower,

12:14.081 --> 12:15.865
see if there's an--

12:15.865 --> 12:18.433
Oh, damn it.

12:18.433 --> 12:22.742
The cops.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.963
Okay.
I need you to do me a favor.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.573
I need you to reach
under the seat

12:28.573 --> 12:29.923
with an open mind
and take the little baggie

12:29.923 --> 12:31.663
that's under there and hide it.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.753
I don't care where.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.107
Just do it.

12:40.847 --> 12:44.241
Afternoon, officer.
Love the sunglasses.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.156
What seems to be the problem?

12:49.116 --> 12:51.466
Figured it was time
we finally met.

12:59.648 --> 13:02.129
Easy, Officer Mustache,
that's fine polyester

13:02.129 --> 13:04.522
you're laying
your dirty fingers on.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.089
Don't worry.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.787
Your friend is just gonna have
a little time-out

13:07.787 --> 13:09.701
while us two girls have a chat.

13:09.701 --> 13:12.617
Don't do anything stupid, kid.

13:12.617 --> 13:14.794
What did you do to my father?

13:14.794 --> 13:18.536
He's alive... for now.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.016
If you want to kill
the woman in this body,

13:20.016 --> 13:21.844
knock yourself out.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.586
I'll keep on rockin'
with or without Roxy.

13:26.196 --> 13:28.155
Be a shame to ruin
such a beauty, though,

13:28.155 --> 13:30.810
don't you think?

13:30.810 --> 13:33.508
- What do you want?
- The Ostium.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.640
You want a box
that can kill you?

13:38.121 --> 13:40.994
That box can't kill me.

13:40.994 --> 13:43.910
Nothing of this Earth
can kill yours truly.

13:46.608 --> 13:47.957
Then what do you want
with it?

13:47.957 --> 13:50.177
Not your concern.

13:50.177 --> 13:55.312
Look, you're out of moves,
and we both know it.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.879
So listen carefully.

13:56.879 --> 14:00.187
There is a phone booth
on Halstead and Maple.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.666
That phone is gonna ring

14:01.666 --> 14:03.494
at 10:00 p.m. tonight
on the dot.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.845
You're gonna take that call
and get instructions

14:05.845 --> 14:08.848
on where to go
for the exchange.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.720
Your dad for the box.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.985
You really think
I'm gonna trust you?

14:15.985 --> 14:18.596
Honey, I don't care
if you trust me.

14:18.596 --> 14:21.991
But if you want your daddy back
in working order,

14:21.991 --> 14:24.037
you're gonna do like I say.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.090
I didn't mean what I said
about your glasses.

14:39.052 --> 14:40.444
Hey, you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.711
- What does she want?
- The box

14:46.711 --> 14:51.020
in exchange for my dad
if he's even still alive.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.196
Well, good thing I put
a hex bag

14:53.196 --> 14:55.198
in the back of that cruiser.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.548
We just need the right spell
to track them.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.289
You can cast that spell?

14:59.289 --> 15:01.204
Of course not.

15:01.204 --> 15:04.555
But our sweet little
Samantha Stevens, Ada, can.

15:04.555 --> 15:07.036
I mean, look, this
is obviously some sort of trap.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.603
But if we can trap them,
we can get the drop

15:08.603 --> 15:11.345
on Queen Roxy.
- And get revenge.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.699
Roxy has my dad.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.617
But we have an insane idea
on how to get him back.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.575
How insane are we talking?

15:24.575 --> 15:26.926
Certifiable
with a side of sassy.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.405
Do you know how to track
a hex bag?

15:28.405 --> 15:29.798
If I know the ingredients
of the bag,

15:29.798 --> 15:31.408
then yeah, I can track it.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.454
Well, can you do it
before 10:00 tonight?

15:33.454 --> 15:36.587
That's when Roxy wants to trade
my dad for the box.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.763
That's gotta be a trap, right?

15:38.763 --> 15:41.288
Which is why we gotta find
Roxy before the drop

15:41.288 --> 15:43.464
and get this Ostium working
before we leave.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.689
Oh.

15:54.649 --> 15:57.478
I'm sorry.

15:57.478 --> 16:01.264
I just needed a break
from that handwriting

16:01.264 --> 16:03.005
and those kids.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.790
How do you put up with them?

16:05.790 --> 16:08.663
I let them pretend
to be in charge.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.317
And I drink.

16:13.059 --> 16:17.889
Henry never brought me
for a tour.

16:17.889 --> 16:21.067
I didn't even know
this place existed.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.157
Henry talked
about you and John.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.335
Anything good?

16:28.335 --> 16:30.424
All of it good.

16:31.860 --> 16:36.691
He did worry what his vocation
was doing to his marriage.

16:36.691 --> 16:39.302
Oh, here I thought

16:39.302 --> 16:42.001
he didn't worry
about that at all.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.003
It's the only reason
he wanted to separate.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.483
Thought it'd be better
for you and John.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.140
Would have been nice
to have heard that at the time.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.924
I said as much.

16:52.924 --> 16:55.927
I said, "If I had what you had,
I would never let it go."

16:55.927 --> 17:00.019
But, you know, Henry was--
- Stubborn.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.238
I was going to use a
bit more colorful wording.

17:05.589 --> 17:12.335
Seeing John here,
it's like history repeating.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.163
I can't lose him
the way I did Henry.

17:14.163 --> 17:17.210
John isn't closed off
the way Henry was.

17:17.210 --> 17:20.517
Now, if he could just--
- Let go of his anger.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.867
Yes.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.522
John told me
about your son.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.698
Tony.

17:27.698 --> 17:31.093
- How's he doing?
- We're a work in progress.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.616
I'm making up for mistakes,

17:32.616 --> 17:36.098
and he is learning to let go
of his anger.

17:38.753 --> 17:42.365
Boys.

17:47.283 --> 17:50.721
I'm still new to all this.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.810
So how does this locator spell
work?

17:52.810 --> 17:56.901
Plants break the earth
to reach for the Sun.

17:56.901 --> 17:59.121
This one, though,
will reach for the hex bag

17:59.121 --> 18:02.820
Carlos put in the cop car.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.561
<i>Excresco.</i>

18:16.747 --> 18:18.140
Fascinating.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.968
According to
what Millie deciphered,

18:19.968 --> 18:22.101
the Ostium doesn't kill monsters.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.494
It transports them.
- Where?

18:24.494 --> 18:26.235
I'm not sure yet.

18:26.235 --> 18:27.758
But there's good news here.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.586
The Akrida
are an invading force

18:29.586 --> 18:31.110
that act as one.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.851
They infiltrate,
wipe out all signs of life,

18:33.851 --> 18:36.767
and take over whole worlds
as their own.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.465
You and I have
very different ideas

18:38.465 --> 18:40.815
about good news.
- The good news

18:40.815 --> 18:44.253
is that the Akrida all share
a connection to their queen.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.342
It's similar
to a colony of ants.

18:46.342 --> 18:47.822
Using the box on the queen

18:47.822 --> 18:50.129
will cut the connection
to the colony.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.131
They can't survive
without their queen.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.436
We take out the queen

18:53.436 --> 18:55.525
we take them all out
in one shot?

18:55.525 --> 18:57.614
So we use the Ostium

18:57.614 --> 19:00.008
to boot the queen
to God knows where.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.357
The rest of the Akrida
are toast.

19:01.357 --> 19:06.014
Mary's dad
and the day are saved.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.711
Carlos, what's wrong?
That's good news.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.713
Y-yeah.

19:09.713 --> 19:12.716
It's just that, you know,
once we do that,

19:12.716 --> 19:14.153
uh, Mary's done with hunting

19:14.153 --> 19:16.285
and our band is splitting up.

19:16.285 --> 19:19.332
No more Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young.

19:21.464 --> 19:24.206
<i>♪ Come down on your own</i>

19:24.206 --> 19:27.340
<i>♪ And leave your body alone</i>

19:27.340 --> 19:28.993
I'm gonna miss us.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.692
Hey, guys,
you gotta come see this.

19:31.692 --> 19:34.651
<i>♪ But I'm near the end</i>

19:34.651 --> 19:39.352

<i>♪ Oh and I'm wasted

19:45.227 --> 19:47.925
Plant marks the spot.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.667
- Wait, we were just there.
- That's where we found

19:50.667 --> 19:52.713
the last person
the Akrida were targeting.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.323
You know, where Mary got stung?

19:54.323 --> 19:57.761
So what are the Akrida
doing there?

19:59.894 --> 20:04.551
<i>♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh</i>

20:04.551 --> 20:10.121

20:40.761 --> 20:45.592
<i>♪ But I can't find

20:48.595 --> 20:49.726
If this is where
the Akrida has my dad,

20:49.726 --> 20:51.250
we can save him.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.252
We just gotta get
this box working first.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.558
So where are we?
- Nowhere, I'm afraid.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.081
And by the time we get
through all this,

20:57.081 --> 20:58.561
Tricky Dick will be
in his second term.

20:58.561 --> 21:00.171
Well, when you put it
like that,

21:00.171 --> 21:02.391
the Akrida taking over
doesn't seem half bad.

21:02.391 --> 21:05.264
Unless Nixon's an Akrida.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.656
Clock's ticking.

21:06.656 --> 21:08.615
The meet with Roxy's
in a couple hours.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.269
Look, there is something
useful here.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.184
I know it. Okay?
We just need to find it.

21:13.184 --> 21:15.622
I think
maybe we already have.

21:17.232 --> 21:20.104
- What do you mean?
- I came across this earlier.

21:20.104 --> 21:21.758
I thought it was crazy.

21:21.758 --> 21:24.413
But that was
before I watched Ada transform

21:24.413 --> 21:26.850
a plant into a compass.
Here, see for yourself.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.809
Okay.

21:31.377 --> 21:34.945
It looks like instructions
to some kind of spirit session.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.599
Sounds like
some kind of séance.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.297
What if we don't have
to keep looking

21:38.297 --> 21:39.341
through Henry's notes?

21:39.341 --> 21:42.344
What if we can just ask him?

21:42.344 --> 21:43.650
You want to talk to Dad?

21:43.650 --> 21:46.609
I told you it was crazy.

21:46.609 --> 21:49.960
Ada, Lata, do you
actually think this could work?

21:49.960 --> 21:51.614
Yeah.
According to Henry's notes,

21:51.614 --> 21:53.834
we just need an object
with an emotional connection

21:53.834 --> 21:55.139
between the living
and the dead.

21:55.139 --> 21:56.358
The stronger the connection,

21:56.358 --> 21:58.317
the more likely the contact.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.536
So we just need an object
connecting one of you to Henry.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.364
Not to endorse
an institution I abhor,

22:02.364 --> 22:05.062
but have you thought about
maybe your old wedding ring?

22:05.062 --> 22:07.674
That'd be great.
If only I hadn't sold it

22:07.674 --> 22:10.024
to fix the hydraulic lift
at the garage.

22:10.024 --> 22:12.374
Sorry.
- What about you?

22:18.728 --> 22:20.339
Well, that depends.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.818
Does it say
that you have to have

22:21.818 --> 22:23.646
good feelings connected
to the object?

22:23.646 --> 22:25.387
No.

22:25.387 --> 22:28.999
Only that the feelings
have to be strong.

22:28.999 --> 22:31.654
Yeah.

22:31.654 --> 22:34.396
Yeah, I have something.

22:34.396 --> 22:37.007
I just need to go get it.

23:32.933 --> 23:35.544
I'll get word to Roxy.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.764
It won't be long now.

24:01.831 --> 24:05.618
Dad got it for me
when I was a kid.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.446
I used to listen
to the song it played

24:07.446 --> 24:09.273
every night before bed.

24:09.273 --> 24:13.364
"As Time Goes By."
It was our song.

24:16.367 --> 24:19.501
I didn't even know
you still had that.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.156
After he left,
I used to play the song.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.114
I thought
that if I kept playing it,

24:24.114 --> 24:26.116
then maybe he'd come back.

24:26.116 --> 24:28.858
And when I realized
he wouldn't,

24:28.858 --> 24:32.383
I, um--I got angry,
and I broke it.

24:33.863 --> 24:36.387
It hasn't worked since.

24:41.349 --> 24:44.395
John, I'm so sorry.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.702
Don't be.

24:46.702 --> 24:49.488
Okay? Not if it helps us find
your dad.

24:52.839 --> 24:55.015
So what do we do next?

24:55.015 --> 24:57.060
Well,
according to Henry's notes,

24:57.060 --> 24:58.627
the object will act
as a conduit

24:58.627 --> 25:01.064
between you and him
in the spirit realm.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.805
The connection itself, however,

25:02.805 --> 25:04.807
has to be created
by your emotions.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.505
You need to reach out
and share them with him

25:06.505 --> 25:08.332
openly and honestly.

25:08.332 --> 25:09.986
That's the only way the divide
between the two realms

25:09.986 --> 25:13.033
can be connected.

25:13.033 --> 25:16.558
Will the rest of him be able
to talk to him too?

25:16.558 --> 25:18.429
Once the connection is made.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.693
But we don't know
how long it's going to last.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.172
So you need to get
as much information

25:22.172 --> 25:24.435
about the Ostium
as quickly as possible.

25:24.435 --> 25:26.002
Hey, it's not like we have
15 years

25:26.002 --> 25:27.961
we'd like to catch up on.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.661
Are you ready?

25:32.661 --> 25:34.228
No.

25:37.492 --> 25:39.189
Let's do this.

25:39.189 --> 25:43.193
both: <i>Amate spiritus obscure,
te quaerimus.</i>

25:43.193 --> 25:46.675
<i>Te oramus,
nobiscum colloquere,</i>

25:46.675 --> 25:49.025
<i>apud nos circita.</i>

25:49.025 --> 25:53.029
<i>Amate spiritus obscure,
te quaerimus.</i>

25:53.029 --> 25:56.206
<i>Te oramus,
nobiscum colloquere,</i>

25:56.206 --> 25:58.252
<i>apud nos circita.</i>

25:58.252 --> 26:01.472
<i>Amate spiritus obscure,
te quaerimus.</i>

26:01.472 --> 26:03.866
<i>Te oramus,
nobiscum colloquere,</i>

26:03.866 --> 26:05.564
<i>apud nos circita.</i>

26:05.564 --> 26:08.871
<i>Amate spiritus obscure--</i>

26:08.871 --> 26:12.266
- What happened?
- Did everyone see the candles?

26:20.927 --> 26:23.494
I don't want to be
a Debbie Downer,

26:23.494 --> 26:25.496
but I think
it was just a draft.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.245
I'm afraid it didn't work.

26:35.245 --> 26:38.640
Why not? Hmm?

26:38.640 --> 26:40.599
I thought about my dad
like you asked me to.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.775
I'm so sorry.
I-I don't know.

26:47.214 --> 26:51.610
John...

27:11.325 --> 27:13.327
Hey.

27:13.327 --> 27:15.546
Guess I shouldn't be
surprised he didn't show up.

27:18.332 --> 27:21.204
He never came
to my baseball games either.

27:24.686 --> 27:27.384
John, I--

27:27.384 --> 27:30.170
I can't imagine
how hard it must have been,

27:30.170 --> 27:33.129
you being so young
when he left.

27:33.129 --> 27:35.479
It's understandable
that you're angry.

27:35.479 --> 27:38.482
Truthfully?

27:38.482 --> 27:39.570
I'm just surprised
I didn't break

27:39.570 --> 27:42.878
that music box sooner.

27:42.878 --> 27:44.924
Why? What do you mean?

27:50.843 --> 27:53.802
Well, before he left,

27:53.802 --> 27:56.413
after he'd tuck me in,

27:56.413 --> 28:00.722
I would hear him
and my mom fight.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.985
I could never--

28:02.985 --> 28:05.205
I could never hear
what about, but, um...

28:07.555 --> 28:10.210
I could hear them say my name.

28:12.038 --> 28:16.216
So I would, uh,
crank the motor on that box

28:16.216 --> 28:19.175
over and over and over
just trying

28:19.175 --> 28:20.742
to drown out the noise.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.747
Most of the time it worked, except...

28:28.576 --> 28:31.622
I still knew
they were fighting about me.

28:31.622 --> 28:33.842
You didn't just smash
the music box

28:33.842 --> 28:37.367
because you were angry
at your dad.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.718
You were also angry
at yourself.

28:41.328 --> 28:44.766
Maybe if I could have been, uh,

28:44.766 --> 28:49.466
better or smarter,
I don't know...

28:52.774 --> 28:54.950
maybe he wouldn't have left.

28:56.038 --> 28:58.737
You were just a kid.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.217
Your dad leaving
is not your fault.

29:01.217 --> 29:04.438
Then tell me
why it feels like it is?

29:05.439 --> 29:09.748
You should listen to her, sport.

29:09.748 --> 29:13.099
It wasn't your fault.

29:13.099 --> 29:15.275
It was mine.

29:29.550 --> 29:32.814
Look at you.

29:32.814 --> 29:35.121
You got so big.

29:35.121 --> 29:39.299
I-I can't believe
I'm talking to you.

29:41.127 --> 29:44.434
I-I am, right?
I'm not imagining this?

29:44.434 --> 29:47.133
You were honest
with your feelings.

29:47.133 --> 29:49.439
Must be why it finally worked.

29:49.439 --> 29:52.921
So who's your friend?

29:52.921 --> 29:57.970
Uh... Dad, this is Mary.

29:57.970 --> 30:00.581
Hi, Mr. Winchester.

30:03.192 --> 30:07.501
- Your mother, is she, uh--
- I'll go get her.

30:13.550 --> 30:17.163
Listen, son,
there's so much.

30:17.163 --> 30:20.122
I need to explain why I left.

30:23.343 --> 30:28.391
Look, Dad, we don't have
time for that.

30:28.391 --> 30:31.133
We need your help.
- My help?

30:31.133 --> 30:34.180
The Akrida.

30:34.180 --> 30:36.486
They're back.

30:42.449 --> 30:44.668
You need to get the Ostium.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.670
It's the only thing--
- No, we-we already have it.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.150
Okay, we know it's some kind
of magical portal,

30:48.150 --> 30:52.198
but it's broken.
- Broken? That's unlikely.

30:52.198 --> 30:54.156
But it may need to be recharged.

30:54.156 --> 30:55.375
Are you telling me,
this whole time,

30:55.375 --> 30:56.680
all we had to do
was plug it in?

30:56.680 --> 30:58.160
It's not that simple.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.858
The energy source
doesn't simply give

30:59.858 --> 31:01.424
the Ostium its power.

31:01.424 --> 31:03.687
It also determines
where the portal opens

31:03.687 --> 31:05.733
so the Akrida will be sent
back to their world

31:05.733 --> 31:08.214
where the only ones
they can hurt are themselves.

31:08.214 --> 31:11.347
Okay, so this--
this energy source--

31:11.347 --> 31:12.348
I mean, tell me
the Men of Letters

31:12.348 --> 31:14.350
still have some.

31:14.350 --> 31:15.874
We were each given
a piece to hide

31:15.874 --> 31:18.093
in case of an emergency
just like this.

31:18.093 --> 31:20.879
- Where'd you hide it here?
- Not here.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.358
Back home.

31:22.358 --> 31:24.926
There's a jasmine vine
I planted years ago.

31:24.926 --> 31:28.625
On the side of the garage.

31:28.625 --> 31:31.454
It's still there.

31:31.454 --> 31:34.544
I had a feeling
it'd be safe there.

31:34.544 --> 31:37.112
Your mom always hated
going near that thing.

31:41.638 --> 31:43.031
How is she?

31:44.903 --> 31:47.253
Well, she's not too happy
I got in the monster business.

31:49.777 --> 31:53.346
But, um, she's coming around.

31:54.869 --> 31:57.132
Well, I'm glad.

32:00.266 --> 32:04.400
This is a dangerous world
you've stepped into.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.750
You watch out for yourself
and your mom.

32:11.103 --> 32:12.582
I'm proud of you, son.

32:19.154 --> 32:20.939
Thank you.

32:23.550 --> 32:26.466
Dad?
- Son, I'm right here.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.514
- Henry.
- Millie.

32:35.301 --> 32:37.129
Know that I love you.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.830
Both of you.

32:45.137 --> 32:46.790
Dad...

33:03.111 --> 33:05.461
So the energy source
is a rock?

33:05.461 --> 33:07.028
Not just any rock.

33:07.028 --> 33:09.030
Look at the density
and the strange pits.

33:09.030 --> 33:11.685
I think this
is where the Akrida are from.

33:11.685 --> 33:14.470
- Another world?
- Another universe.

33:14.470 --> 33:15.558
I don't know.
But it's definitely not

33:15.558 --> 33:17.473
from around here.

33:17.473 --> 33:19.127
Maybe that's how it directs
the portal like my dad said.

33:19.127 --> 33:20.346
Tells it where to open.

33:27.875 --> 33:30.051
Okay.

33:30.051 --> 33:31.792
Let's save my dad.

33:33.446 --> 33:36.492
I don't see
any scuttling inside.

33:36.492 --> 33:38.886
I mean, if this is really
the Akrida's new roach motel,

33:38.886 --> 33:41.149
they're doing a really good job
of keeping it a secret.

33:41.149 --> 33:44.065
They're in there somewhere.
We just have to find them.

33:44.065 --> 33:46.720
So what's the plan?

33:46.720 --> 33:48.852
Split up. Cover more ground.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.680
We have to find my dad
and we have to find Roxy.

33:50.680 --> 33:54.423
We take her out,
the Akrida are toast.

33:54.423 --> 33:56.860
Be careful not to use the box
before you find her.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.558
We don't know how many monsters
that thing can handle

33:58.558 --> 34:00.168
before it goes dead
like it did last time.

34:10.918 --> 34:13.094
This might be
a stupid question,

34:13.094 --> 34:15.531
but, um, how exactly
are we supposed to know

34:15.531 --> 34:17.359
the queen when we see her?

34:17.359 --> 34:20.101
Look for a crown, I guess.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.798
Right.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.803
Perfect.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.769
Remember, these are
innocent people we're fighting,

34:35.769 --> 34:38.772
so you have to use
demon possession rules.

34:38.772 --> 34:42.384
I got this, Campbell.

34:46.127 --> 34:49.087
No.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.002
Break 'em,
shake 'em, and move on.

35:39.049 --> 35:40.529
- Argh!
- Ahh!

35:42.183 --> 35:47.710
Okay.

35:51.105 --> 35:55.544
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

35:55.544 --> 35:59.157
Yeah.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.550
Ahh!

36:11.343 --> 36:13.519
No sign of Samuel anywhere.

36:13.519 --> 36:14.824
What is this place?

36:14.824 --> 36:17.262
Looks like some kind of lab.

36:19.351 --> 36:20.961
Carlos, look.

36:22.571 --> 36:24.486
Now, I've never seen
monster essence before,

36:24.486 --> 36:28.360
but if I had to guess,
it probably looks like that.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.104
We need something
to break the glass.

36:41.024 --> 36:43.375
Lata. Come on.

36:43.375 --> 36:44.550
Come on. Move, move, move,
move, move.

36:44.550 --> 36:48.423
Go.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.712
That can't be good, right?

37:16.712 --> 37:18.148
Tomorrow's problem.

37:18.148 --> 37:21.282
We need to get out of here
and find Samuel.

37:21.282 --> 37:24.242
Hello. Where's she going?

37:27.941 --> 37:31.249
And what's in that case?
- I don't know.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.728
Maybe we should follow her.

37:32.728 --> 37:34.252
We can't leave everyone.

37:36.428 --> 37:39.474
I'm gonna need the two of you
to get out of the van, please.

37:44.349 --> 37:47.613
I hope he has
dental insurance.

37:50.964 --> 37:54.097
Excuse me, officer,
would you mind repeating that?

37:54.097 --> 37:56.274
I said--oh!

37:56.274 --> 37:59.277
Ahh!

38:05.195 --> 38:06.762
I warned you.

38:06.762 --> 38:09.287
Stray from the plan
and your father is dead.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.333
And I always keep my promises.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.769
So do I.

38:42.537 --> 38:43.973
Why didn't that one fall?

38:43.973 --> 38:46.236
Maybe your dad's notes
were wrong.

38:46.236 --> 38:47.803
Or maybe Roxy wasn't
the queen.

38:47.803 --> 38:50.066
Okay. Time to go. Time to go.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.158
Go, go, go, go!

39:06.518 --> 39:07.693
I don't think
that door's gonna hold.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.651
There's no way out.

39:15.265 --> 39:19.008
This a normal night for you?

39:19.008 --> 39:21.010
Since I was a kid, yeah.

39:58.613 --> 39:59.701
Dad?

40:02.878 --> 40:06.882
Hey, kiddo.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.060
Dad.

40:48.968 --> 40:51.492
Let's not make her wait
any longer.

41:15.255 --> 41:18.301
We're going to make you
strong again.

41:18.301 --> 41:20.608
And then you'll bring
the others.

41:20.608 --> 41:24.525
And we can make this world
our own...

41:28.181 --> 41:30.139
My queen.
