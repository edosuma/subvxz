WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.400
Over] This is the

00:00.400 --> 00:00.700
Over] This is
the Evergreen Forest,

00:02.635 --> 00:04.938
quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.142
That is until Burt
Raccoon wakes up.

00:22.455 --> 00:25.692
But luckily he has some good
friends to help him out.

00:32.932 --> 00:37.937
Life would be simple in the
forest except for Cyril Sneer.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.612
And his life would be simple
except for The Raccoons.

01:00.994 --> 01:03.363
Another school year
is about to begin

01:03.463 --> 01:05.331
and a visit from Bentley Raccoon

01:05.432 --> 01:09.436
has Burt and Cedric thinking
back to their own school days.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.204
a trek to Evergreen Elementary

01:11.304 --> 01:15.675
is an ideal chance for them to
share those special memories.

01:15.775 --> 01:18.945
Recess, lunchtime,
show and tell,

01:20.013 --> 01:21.381
that's what it's all about.

01:21.481 --> 01:23.817
Well, there was
math, accounting

01:23.917 --> 01:26.052
and don't forget Miss. Primrose.

01:26.152 --> 01:29.422
Oh, who could
forget Miss. Primrose?

01:29.522 --> 01:31.558
Oh, what a teacher.

01:31.658 --> 01:34.060
You were both in
the same classroom?

01:34.160 --> 01:37.497
Naturally, because there
only was one classroom.

01:37.597 --> 01:40.967
Evergreen Elementary's
a one room school house.

01:41.067 --> 01:43.770
Nothing like that new school
you're gonna be going to.

01:43.870 --> 01:45.672
You must be pretty excited.

01:45.772 --> 01:49.776
New school, new teachers to
meet, new friends to make.

01:49.876 --> 01:52.312
Yeah, you seen one school,
you've seen them all.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.047
Hey, there it is, guys.

01:54.147 --> 01:57.417
Ah, the old place never
looked better to me.

01:57.517 --> 01:58.718
What a site.

01:59.652 --> 02:01.621
What a dump.

02:01.721 --> 02:03.590
Hey, the school's open.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.993
Come on, Bentley, now I can
show you the actual desk

02:07.093 --> 02:09.095
where Bert Raccoon sat.

02:11.564 --> 02:12.966
Who was that?

02:13.066 --> 02:15.468
I don't know, but we're
gonna be late for class.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.371
Just like the old days.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.339
Race you.

02:19.439 --> 02:21.107
What's the big rush?

02:21.207 --> 02:22.876
Hey, wait for me.

02:26.212 --> 02:30.483
Bentley, everybody
has to wipe his feet.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.753
Wow, this is it?

02:33.853 --> 02:36.489
My locker was bigger
than this place.

02:36.589 --> 02:38.091
Where's the cafeteria?

02:38.191 --> 02:39.626
Where are the science labs?

02:39.726 --> 02:41.761
Where are the computer rooms?

02:41.861 --> 02:45.632
What could anyone possibly
learn in this place?

02:45.732 --> 02:46.566
Whoops.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.437
Perhaps we could learn
some manners, young man.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.540
And we don't charge in
here tracking in mud

02:53.640 --> 02:55.675
and disrupting my school house,

02:55.775 --> 02:59.112
even if it is being
closed down forever.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.781
- Closed?
- Forever?

03:05.218 --> 03:07.887
Complete audit, sending
out representative,

03:07.987 --> 03:12.192
please verify enclosed
list of inventory.

03:12.292 --> 03:15.195
I own taxes on all of this?

03:15.295 --> 03:17.964
This inventory list
is an invention.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.799
How can the tax
department do this

03:19.899 --> 03:23.102
to a humble millionaire like me?

03:24.137 --> 03:25.238
With a little practice,

03:25.338 --> 03:27.707
we could easily join
the pro circuit.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.876
Make some fast bucks.

03:29.976 --> 03:32.512
And get into another racket.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.516
What in blue blazes
is going on down there?

03:36.616 --> 03:38.885
Ah, interior decorating.

03:39.786 --> 03:40.653
Get up here now

03:42.121 --> 03:44.524
or I'll do some posterior
decorating on you clowns.

03:44.624 --> 03:45.925
Left, right, hut.

03:46.025 --> 03:48.428
Yes sir, boss.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.096
We've got work to do.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.665
The tax man is coming
and I want you three

03:52.765 --> 03:54.734
to get over to the
Sneer warehouse

03:54.834 --> 03:57.136
and start counting inventory.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.505
These figures they have
are way out of line.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.341
But this could take all day.

04:01.441 --> 04:04.744
And we were planning to
practice our tennis serves.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.113
If you don't get
out to that warehouse,

04:07.213 --> 04:10.750
I'll be serving you with
apples in your mouth.

04:10.850 --> 04:11.718
Yes sir.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.355
Clean off those feet.

04:15.455 --> 04:17.523
Stop disrupting my schoolhouse.

04:17.624 --> 04:20.827
What does she think she
is, a general in the army?

04:20.927 --> 04:22.762
I'm just the teacher here.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.665
But can't you get them
to change their minds?

04:25.765 --> 04:28.401
The school has been
here for so long.

04:28.501 --> 04:30.536
You even taught my pop.

04:30.637 --> 04:33.273
Yes, I did.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.809
But that man you saw leaving
here, Inspector. Rutledge,

04:36.909 --> 04:38.678
he's from the school board.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.314
And according to him,
Evergreen Elementary

04:41.414 --> 04:45.618
is just too worn down,
outdated and small.

04:45.718 --> 04:47.420
They just can't
tell you to pack up

04:47.520 --> 04:49.155
and close the school down.

04:49.255 --> 04:50.690
What are you gonna do?

04:50.790 --> 04:53.893
I'm being transferred
to another school

04:53.993 --> 04:55.361
outside the forest.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.665
It's supposed to be very nice,
very modern and very big.

04:58.765 --> 05:01.634
In fact, I'll have more
students in my one class there

05:01.734 --> 05:04.337
than I had in this
whole schoolhouse.

05:04.437 --> 05:05.838
Going to be quite a change.

05:05.938 --> 05:08.975
Let's give Miss. Primrose
a hand with these boxes.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.578
Oh boy.

05:14.013 --> 05:18.318
Gee, I don't remember school
books being as heavy as this.

05:19.552 --> 05:20.953
You know, Cedric,

05:21.054 --> 05:24.691
we just have to think of some
way to help Miss. Primrose.

05:24.791 --> 05:26.592
We can't let them
shut down the school

05:26.693 --> 05:28.728
and transfer her
out at the forest.

05:30.129 --> 05:31.364
I never even wanted
to come and see

05:31.464 --> 05:33.499
her dumb old school
in the first place.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.737
Goodbye, Evergreen Elementary,

05:38.838 --> 05:41.441
hello City Collegiate,
Grade Seven.

05:42.575 --> 05:45.311
City Collegiate, Grade Seven?

05:45.411 --> 05:47.413
That's my school, my class.

05:48.614 --> 05:49.549
I'm doomed.

05:51.951 --> 05:55.388
Oh, don't worry, for
a bunch of pros like us,

05:55.488 --> 05:57.423
this job should be a breeze.

06:01.761 --> 06:02.862
A breeze?

06:02.962 --> 06:05.732
It looks more like
a hurricane to me.

06:08.634 --> 06:09.469
I can't believe
they're actually

06:09.569 --> 06:11.671
closing the old school down.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.406
It seems like only yesterday

06:13.506 --> 06:15.375
we were sitting
in your classroom.

06:15.475 --> 06:16.843
Yes.

06:16.943 --> 06:19.312
There's a lot of wonderful
memories in that room.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.350
Speaking of wonderful,
lunch is served.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.319
Hey, where's Bentley?

06:26.419 --> 06:28.821
Bentley, lunch.

06:28.921 --> 06:29.922
Coming, Bert.

06:31.090 --> 06:34.927
Yes, mom, I'm going to
love my new school, mom.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.096
First day?

06:37.196 --> 06:39.365
No, I can hardly wait, mom.

06:40.433 --> 06:41.467
Bye, mom.

06:43.169 --> 06:44.537
Brother.

06:44.637 --> 06:47.039
Well, Bentley, what
did your mom have to say?

06:47.140 --> 06:48.741
Same old stuff.

06:48.841 --> 06:52.011
You know, Bentley is going
to a new school this year.

06:52.111 --> 06:55.014
You must be really looking
forward to it, Bentley.

06:55.114 --> 06:56.115
Yeah, I really am.

06:57.784 --> 07:01.287
Hey gang, that's
it, a new school.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.591
Maybe if we made the
old school a new school,

07:05.691 --> 07:08.761
we could get the school
board to reconsider.

07:08.861 --> 07:10.596
What do you say, Miss. Primrose?

07:10.696 --> 07:12.765
Well, I appreciate what
you're trying to do, Bert,

07:12.865 --> 07:14.000
but I don't think that--

07:14.100 --> 07:15.935
We could give the
place a coat of paint.

07:16.035 --> 07:17.870
It might give it
a whole new look.

07:17.970 --> 07:20.973
Yeah, and I'll write an
editorial in The Standard.

07:21.073 --> 07:23.743
Kind of rally the
forest around the cause.

07:23.843 --> 07:27.413
If we're going to pull
this off, we'll need money.

07:27.513 --> 07:30.116
I could bake some
cakes and have a sale.

07:30.216 --> 07:32.051
Maybe I could even talk to Pop.

07:32.151 --> 07:33.519
And I could go clean out

07:33.619 --> 07:35.721
the storage closets
at the school.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.623
I've kept a lot of
things over the years.

07:37.723 --> 07:38.825
We could raffle them off.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.593
But I'll need some help.

07:40.693 --> 07:43.896
There you go, Bentley,
something for you to do.

07:43.996 --> 07:47.567
Miss. Primrose and you
should make a great team.

07:47.667 --> 07:50.636
Sure, Bert, anything to help.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.004
I'll go call a school board

07:52.104 --> 07:54.373
and get Inspector.
Rutledge to come back.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.876
We'll get him to
change his mind yet.

07:58.878 --> 08:02.315
688, 689.

08:02.415 --> 08:03.249
688, 689.

08:08.855 --> 08:11.858
Hey, guys, where
should I put these?

08:13.092 --> 08:14.260
Over here.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.194
Capeesh.

08:24.203 --> 08:25.872
Look at this mess.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.641
Hey, excuse me, fellas,

08:28.741 --> 08:31.110
but could I get some directions?

08:31.210 --> 08:32.879
I seem to be lost.

08:32.979 --> 08:35.548
Where are those
procrastinating parkers?

08:37.116 --> 08:39.685
Don't they realize I've
got the tax man on my tail?

08:41.687 --> 08:45.258
Well, thank you, fellas,
for all that information.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.527
You've been great help.

08:47.627 --> 08:50.296
No problem, inspector.

08:50.396 --> 08:54.667
Always glad to help out
a government official.

08:56.035 --> 08:59.505
Why, those two
conniving tenderloins.

08:59.605 --> 09:02.275
They're working with
the tax inspector.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.043
They're spilling their guts.

09:04.143 --> 09:06.646
They're squealing
just like pigs.

09:10.449 --> 09:11.717
Lloyd, Lloyd.

09:14.654 --> 09:16.489
I know this looks bad, boss,

09:16.589 --> 09:18.758
but we can straighten it out.

09:18.858 --> 09:22.828
If you traitorous swine aren't
out of here in 10 seconds,

09:22.929 --> 09:24.664
I'll straighten you out.

09:24.764 --> 09:27.767
You mean we can have
the rest of the day off?

09:27.867 --> 09:30.603
Take the rest of
your lives off, scram, beat it,

09:30.703 --> 09:32.538
hit the road, get out of here.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.006
You are fired.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.076
Fired?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.814
I never realized

09:41.914 --> 09:45.418
how much junk I piled
up over the years.

09:45.518 --> 09:48.955
Bentley, would you mind giving
me a hand with this box?

09:49.055 --> 09:49.889
Sure.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.562
Bert was right, we do
make a good team, don't we?

09:57.730 --> 09:59.565
Hey, where did
you get that from?

09:59.665 --> 10:02.568
Oh, the school board
sent it to us years ago

10:02.668 --> 10:04.737
but I can never get
it working properly.

10:04.837 --> 10:08.007
This is the kind of computer
I learned on at school.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.508
Maybe if I'd been able

10:09.609 --> 10:13.446
to make more use out of that
computer and kept up to date,

10:13.546 --> 10:17.116
the school wouldn't
be in this awful mess.

10:17.216 --> 10:20.386
But I guess it's too late
for an old dog like me

10:20.486 --> 10:21.921
to learn new tricks.

10:24.523 --> 10:26.459
How could the boss
fire us like that?

10:26.559 --> 10:30.630
We never even got the
chance to make up any excuses.

10:32.064 --> 10:35.468
We never even got the
chance to make any lunch.

10:37.903 --> 10:42.141
Lunch.

10:42.241 --> 10:44.143
I said
hold all my calls,

10:44.243 --> 10:46.646
I'm trying to conduct
job interviews.

10:46.746 --> 10:49.181
I need some help
around here fast.

10:49.281 --> 10:52.084
Let's see what your
conditions of employment are.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.654
Statutory holidays, huh?

10:54.754 --> 10:56.389
A 40 hour work week?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.424
Two weeks holidays a year?

10:58.524 --> 11:01.460
What do you think this
is, an executive position?

11:02.795 --> 11:03.629
Next.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.936
Gee, Pop, I guess
you're kind of busy.

11:11.037 --> 11:12.805
I'm beyond busy.

11:12.905 --> 11:15.141
I'm closing in on frazzled.

11:15.241 --> 11:16.976
What can I do for you, son?

11:17.076 --> 11:18.811
Well, pop, a bunch
of us are trying

11:18.911 --> 11:20.312
to get everyone in the forest

11:20.413 --> 11:21.947
to give some money
to help people--

11:22.048 --> 11:22.882
Money?

11:22.982 --> 11:24.150
Don't talk to me about money.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.552
I've got a headache
the size of this room

11:26.652 --> 11:30.156
because I might have
to give my money away.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.224
Anything else, son?

11:32.324 --> 11:34.326
No, Pop, I understand.

11:36.462 --> 11:39.298
No, it can't be.

11:39.398 --> 11:43.169
It's him, the tax man and
he's brought four forms.

11:43.269 --> 11:46.505
I may be out of time, but
I'm never out of tricks.

11:47.807 --> 11:51.177
, I'll be
with you in one minute.

11:51.277 --> 11:54.146
He's on my overseas line.

11:54.246 --> 11:57.917
Just have a seat and relax.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.222
Cyril Sneer is going
to be harder to find

12:03.322 --> 12:05.057
than a mechanic on a weekend.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.497
Gee, there sure is
a lot of stuff here.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.899
Hey, that looks like me.

12:13.999 --> 12:18.771
Oh no, that's Bert with
Cedric, Ralph and Melissa.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.006
Boy, did they look scared.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.775
I guess they were
a little nervous

12:22.875 --> 12:24.410
that first day of school.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.946
I used to make it a
practice over the years

12:27.046 --> 12:30.049
to take pictures of
all my new students.

12:30.149 --> 12:35.154
I remember that day so well.

12:36.622 --> 12:40.392
♪ How will I know things
will turn out all right ♪

12:44.330 --> 12:49.335
♪ Where do you go when there's
no guarantees in life ♪

12:53.439 --> 12:57.710
♪ Give me a chance to find out ♪

12:57.810 --> 13:02.248
♪ I can't do it on my own ♪

13:02.348 --> 13:07.286

to realize my goals ♪

13:10.790 --> 13:15.094
♪ Can you teach me what to do ♪

13:15.194 --> 13:19.799
♪ Will you show me
the meaning of love ♪

13:19.899 --> 13:24.370

13:24.470 --> 13:28.941

13:48.160 --> 13:53.165
♪ How do you know the
feelings you have inside ♪

13:54.333 --> 13:56.535
And this was their
last day of school.

13:57.803 --> 13:58.971
I never realized,

13:59.071 --> 14:01.173
but I guess everyone
gets a little scared

14:01.273 --> 14:04.143
going to a new school,
don't they, Miss. Primrose?

14:04.243 --> 14:08.180
Oh, Bentley, I don't
want to leave this place.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.758
I hope the bumping around
didn't ruin something.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.095
Oh, I certainly hope not.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.763
Pop, what are you doing here?

14:24.864 --> 14:27.233
Oh, I had to get
out of the house.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.601
I thought I'd drop by.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.936
But what are you doing
at the school house?

14:31.036 --> 14:32.905
I tried to tell you, Pop.

14:33.005 --> 14:34.506
We're holding a fundraiser

14:34.607 --> 14:37.309
to save the school
from closing down.

14:37.409 --> 14:38.244
Closing down?

14:39.812 --> 14:43.315
The old school hasn't changed
much in all these years.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.952
Yeah, and that's
the problem, Pop.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.454
Miss. Primrose?

14:49.855 --> 14:53.259
Why, if it isn't
little Cyril Sneer.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.461
You still remember me?

14:55.561 --> 14:58.397
Of course I remember.

14:58.497 --> 15:02.301
You were the best math
student I ever taught.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.836
It was unfortunate that

15:03.936 --> 15:06.071
you had to leave
school when you did.

15:06.171 --> 15:09.642
Yes, well, I had to help out
in the family business and--

15:09.742 --> 15:13.012
And you've
done so well for yourself.

15:13.112 --> 15:16.048
I've kept my eye on you.

15:16.148 --> 15:18.984
I always knew you
had what it takes.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.720
Miss. Primrose, can you
come here for a minute?

15:21.820 --> 15:23.856
Sounds just like
old times, doesn't it?

15:23.956 --> 15:25.925
Have a look around,
but be careful

15:26.025 --> 15:28.494
or someone will fix
you up with a job.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.096
Welcome to
Evergreen Elementary's

15:31.196 --> 15:33.799
very first computer room.

15:33.899 --> 15:36.735
Bentley, this is wonderful.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.637
Want to be the first
to give it a try?

15:38.737 --> 15:41.674
Oh, why, really, I shouldn't--

15:41.774 --> 15:43.242
Give it a try.

15:43.342 --> 15:47.680
Oh, oh well, I'm not the
greatest student, am I?

15:47.780 --> 15:50.482
Just hold that key down
while you push this one.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.218
I did it.

15:53.319 --> 15:56.755
I never thought I'd see the
day I could use one of these.

15:56.855 --> 16:00.125
Do you know, Bentley, you've
been a big help to me?

16:00.225 --> 16:03.429
It would've been great to
have had you as a student.

16:04.863 --> 16:08.367
There's something I've
been meaning to tell you.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.203
I am your student, sort of.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.205
Well, what do you mean?

16:13.305 --> 16:18.043
Well, you were transferred
to my school, my classroom.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.578
I didn't tell you because

16:19.678 --> 16:21.547
I was worried about
going to City Collegiate

16:21.647 --> 16:24.149
and having you as my teacher.

16:24.249 --> 16:27.286
But that's all changed
because we're--

16:27.386 --> 16:32.391
Yes, we're still friends,
and I understand, Bentley.

16:34.493 --> 16:38.063
You know, that would be great,

16:38.163 --> 16:40.532
both of us at the same school,

16:40.632 --> 16:43.302
because we're really
two of a kind.

16:45.604 --> 16:48.040
What I wouldn't
give for a dozen

16:48.140 --> 16:49.942
chocolate donuts right now.

16:50.042 --> 16:52.077
Stop talking about food.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.345
Hey, look.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.014
A donut shop.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.515
A car.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.017
I'll handle this.

16:58.117 --> 17:00.953
Just keep him quiet and don't
let him chew on the chrome.

17:02.154 --> 17:05.224
Well, when you told
me you were veterans,

17:05.324 --> 17:06.959
I had to stop, I did.

17:07.059 --> 17:09.395
You told him we were veterans?

17:09.495 --> 17:11.663
I said veterans of the road.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.365
Excuse me, fellas,

17:13.465 --> 17:16.368
but how do we get
out of this forest?

17:16.468 --> 17:18.203
Turn to your right up here.

17:20.439 --> 17:23.776
Oh, good heavens,
I'm back where I started.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.444
Do you smell that?

17:25.544 --> 17:27.980
Yes, it smells like--

17:28.080 --> 17:30.516
(indistinct).

17:30.616 --> 17:32.584
Stop, turn around.

17:34.286 --> 17:35.287
Why, what's this?

17:37.623 --> 17:40.359
Poor kid who had to wear
that ridiculous costume.

17:40.459 --> 17:42.728
I wore it in the Easter play.

17:42.828 --> 17:47.199
Oh, well, what do
I know about fashion?

17:47.299 --> 17:51.103
Hey, these are great
looking cakes, Cedric.

17:51.203 --> 17:52.638
Hey gang, someone's coming.

17:53.672 --> 17:54.773
What?

17:54.873 --> 17:57.609
Why, those back
stabbing bacon bits.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.578
They're really out for revenge.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.881
They've sniffed me out and
brought the tax man too.

18:02.981 --> 18:05.484
Perhaps we should have
turned left back there.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.287
What do you think, fellas?

18:08.387 --> 18:10.022
I can't let them find me.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.190
I need an escape.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.665
Hello again, Mr. Rutledge.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.934
We weren't
expecting you so soon,

18:22.034 --> 18:25.070
but have we got
something to show you.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.538
Expecting me?

18:26.638 --> 18:29.408
We've cleaned and polished,
we've painted and washed.

18:29.508 --> 18:32.044
We breathed new life
into an old school.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.813
Hey, we've even got
a computer room.

18:34.913 --> 18:37.649
What do you say to
that, Mr. Rutledge?

18:39.051 --> 18:40.018
Gee.

18:42.821 --> 18:43.655
Uh-oh.

18:45.224 --> 18:47.392
Well, judging by all
the work you've done,

18:47.493 --> 18:50.195
the school must mean
a lot to all of you,

18:50.295 --> 18:53.999
but unfortunately, Evergreen
Elementary is just too small.

18:54.099 --> 18:56.435
A major expansion
is the only answer

18:56.535 --> 18:58.270
and we just don't
have the money.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.240
But you're the
school board inspector.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.175
Can't you do something?

19:03.275 --> 19:05.377
School board
inspector, closed?

19:06.778 --> 19:09.148
Not if Cyril Sneer has
anything to say about it.

19:09.248 --> 19:10.949
Listen, mister inspector,

19:11.049 --> 19:13.852
this place is too
important to shut down.

19:13.952 --> 19:16.054
I went here for as
long as I could,

19:16.155 --> 19:19.324
and as long as I'm here, this
place is going to stay open.

19:19.424 --> 19:22.094
Tell your bumbling
bureaucratic bosses

19:22.194 --> 19:24.630
that I'll fight them all
the way on this, I'll--

19:24.730 --> 19:27.065
Cover the costs of expansion?

19:28.233 --> 19:30.602
Well, let's not
be hasty either.

19:30.702 --> 19:33.272
This is my money
we're talking about.

19:33.372 --> 19:35.974
There's this little tax
problem I have to sort out,

19:36.074 --> 19:38.043
otherwise I'd be glad to help.

19:38.143 --> 19:41.213
Public donations are
tax deductible, you know?

19:42.381 --> 19:45.851
He's right, Pop,
100% deductible.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.587
Tax deductible?

19:48.687 --> 19:50.522
Why, that's brilliant.

19:50.622 --> 19:51.790
Yes.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.892
Oh yes, it is.

19:53.992 --> 19:56.295
What would you say,
Rutledge, to a donation

19:56.395 --> 19:59.097
big enough to bring this
school up to scratch?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.567
Well, there would
be some paperwork

20:01.667 --> 20:04.670
and of course Evergreen
Elementary would
have to be expanded

20:05.537 --> 20:08.907
but I'd say we've got a deal.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.310
The school can stay open.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.319
It seems I made
a rather inaccurate

20:20.419 --> 20:22.788
assessment back
at the warehouse.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.356
He what?

20:24.456 --> 20:28.794
And you boys just
saved me a pile of dough.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.363
So how about we let
bygones be bygones

20:31.463 --> 20:33.198
and pick up from
where we left off?

20:33.298 --> 20:35.834
You mean we can
have our jobs back?

20:35.934 --> 20:38.670
Yeah, but I'm
deducting a day's pay

20:38.770 --> 20:40.973
for this little
holiday you've had.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.608
Holiday?

20:42.708 --> 20:44.343
Gee, thanks, boss.

20:47.980 --> 20:51.416
Gee, we're really gonna
miss you around here.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.252
Are you sure you have to go?

20:53.352 --> 20:55.487
I'm afraid so, boys.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.456
I've given it a lot of thought,

20:57.556 --> 21:02.160
and I know now I was just
afraid of facing something new.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.796
So I'm off to City Collegiate

21:04.896 --> 21:07.332
to learn more about the
newfangled technology

21:07.432 --> 21:09.301
Bentley has been showing me.

21:09.401 --> 21:12.237
I'm going to be a
teacher and a student.

21:13.839 --> 21:18.343
After all, someone has to run
the new Evergreen Elementary

21:18.443 --> 21:22.481
and the Cyril Sneer Wing
when it's built, right?

21:23.448 --> 21:24.983
All right.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.221
Come on, Miss.
Primrose, let's get going.

21:29.321 --> 21:31.890
I want to look
around our new school

21:31.990 --> 21:34.326
because we're gonna be
the new faces this year.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.362
