<i>Air and naval
forces</i> <i>of the United States</i>

00:08.900 --> 00:11.698

00:11.732 --> 00:13.697
<i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed</i>

00:13.731 --> 00:15.161
<i>He has sanctioned</i>

00:15.195 --> 00:17.829
<i>in Africa, Europe,</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

00:17.863 --> 00:20.465
<i>This will not stand,</i>
<i>this</i> <i>aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:20.500 --> 00:22.201
<i>REAGAN:</i> <i>This relentless
pursuit</i> <i>of terror.</i>

00:22.235 --> 00:23.837
PRESIDENT GEORGE W.
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:23.871 --> 00:25.343
<i>The</i> USS Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:25.377 --> 00:26.542
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:26.576 --> 00:28.509
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.543 --> 00:31.008
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:31.042 --> 00:33.343
<i>The next song</i>
<i>we're going to play for you</i>

00:33.377 --> 00:34.511
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:34.545 --> 00:36.917
Until something stops him.

00:36.952 --> 00:39.986
<i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:40.020 --> 00:43.554
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:44.922 --> 00:47.188
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:47.222 --> 00:50.893
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:57.537 --> 01:00.005
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

01:00.039 --> 01:02.007
God!

01:02.041 --> 01:04.010
<i>Fuck! I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

01:04.044 --> 01:06.812
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

01:08.080 --> 01:10.214
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

01:10.248 --> 01:11.915
<i>Everyone missed something</i>

<i>I appreciate you</i>

01:29.297 --> 01:31.865
Like you did while I was gone.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.802
You were my friend! You...

01:34.837 --> 01:35.870
Carrie here.

01:35.904 --> 01:37.038
It's me.

01:37.072 --> 01:38.073
Where are you?

01:38.107 --> 01:39.541
I'm taking some time,

01:39.575 --> 01:41.576
from home.

01:43.813 --> 01:46.215
<i>I know I have oatmeal,</i>

01:46.249 --> 01:49.385
but no Yorkshire Gold out here
in the sticks. Sorry.

01:49.419 --> 01:51.053
How do you know
the tea I drink?

01:51.087 --> 01:52.654
<i>Did you spy on me?</i>

01:52.689 --> 01:54.756
You are a spy, right?

01:54.790 --> 01:59.226
You're telling me the fucking CIA
thinks I'm working for al-Qaeda?

01:59.261 --> 02:02.395
I think you're working
for al-Qaeda.

02:02.430 --> 02:05.331
We have a deal with Aileen.
What did she tell you?

02:05.365 --> 02:07.766
They were just told to buy the
house, go about their business

02:07.801 --> 02:08.934
till a visitor arrived.

02:08.967 --> 02:10.435
Which he did on Monday.

02:10.469 --> 02:12.237
She's sitting with a sketch
artist right now.

02:12.271 --> 02:14.439
Ask me anything.

02:14.473 --> 02:16.741
Why did they kill
Walker and not you?

02:16.775 --> 02:19.310
I killed him.

02:21.213 --> 02:23.281
Galvez, you up there?
Affirmative.

02:23.315 --> 02:25.150
Face the airport, Galvez.

02:25.184 --> 02:26.985
We're looking for

02:27.019 --> 02:28.453
direct targets.

02:29.556 --> 02:31.457
Reserve M-1.

02:33.526 --> 02:35.494
<i>That's a landing pad</i>
<i>for Marine 1.</i>

02:35.528 --> 02:37.262
Oh, shit.

02:37.297 --> 02:39.598
A mile is well within
a sniper's range.

02:39.632 --> 02:41.132
An expert sniper.

02:41.167 --> 02:43.368
Saul.

02:43.402 --> 02:45.369
We were wrong about Brody.

02:45.404 --> 02:47.037
A P.O.W. Was turned,

02:47.072 --> 02:50.206
<i>but it wasn't him.</i>

02:50.241 --> 02:53.209
Aileen just I.D.'d Tom Walker.

02:53.243 --> 02:55.445
He's alive.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.147
He's the terrorist.

03:07.224 --> 03:09.125
Yo.

03:09.159 --> 03:11.895
Homeless vet here.

03:11.929 --> 03:16.499
Hey, I fought your war.

03:16.534 --> 03:18.401
Iraq-- ring a bell?

03:20.337 --> 03:22.038
Hey, come on, man.

03:22.072 --> 03:24.240
I'm hungry.

03:24.274 --> 03:25.941
Ma'am, ma'am?

03:28.511 --> 03:31.012
Ma'am?

03:31.047 --> 03:33.114
Nah.

03:35.685 --> 03:37.519
Thank you. God bless you.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.390
God bless the little children.

03:41.425 --> 03:44.059
Thank you, little man.

03:46.529 --> 03:49.230
All right, all right.

04:03.913 --> 04:05.514
Yo.

04:05.548 --> 04:07.616
Hungry here.

04:48.425 --> 04:51.260
Is this the man you saw?

04:51.294 --> 04:52.794
Your father?

04:55.131 --> 04:56.999
Is this your office?

04:57.033 --> 04:59.268
Yeah, yeah, this is my office.

04:59.302 --> 05:02.771
I thought you were a spy.

05:02.805 --> 05:06.174
I guess, in a--
in a way.

05:07.944 --> 05:09.945
How can you spy on anyone
sitting in here?

05:09.979 --> 05:11.846
Lucas, Lucas, come on.

05:11.881 --> 05:13.849
Just... What did we agree?

05:13.883 --> 05:15.684
That everything
had to be secret.

05:15.718 --> 05:17.319
Right, and what else?

05:17.353 --> 05:18.921
You get to ask
your questions first.

05:21.191 --> 05:23.960
Why'd you do that?
Touch your nose?

05:23.995 --> 05:28.598
He told me he'd seen
his father at school.

05:28.633 --> 05:30.934
Watching him through
the chain link.

05:30.969 --> 05:33.703
It never occurred to me
it could actually be true.

05:33.738 --> 05:36.339
Tom was dead.

05:36.374 --> 05:37.507
That's what they told me.

05:37.542 --> 05:38.875
I know it's a lot to deal with.

05:38.910 --> 05:40.344
You think?

05:40.378 --> 05:42.979
For years I pray Tom's alive.

05:43.014 --> 05:46.316
Now you tell me he is, but he's
turned into some kind of monster?

05:46.350 --> 05:48.051
I didn't say that.
Yes, you did.

05:48.085 --> 05:50.653
"Brainwashed." That was
the word you used.

05:50.687 --> 05:52.855
Planning an attack
on his own country.

05:52.889 --> 05:55.692
That's what we believe.

05:55.726 --> 05:59.363
So I don't know whether
I should be celebrating

05:59.397 --> 06:02.199
or putting my son and
I into witness protection.

06:02.234 --> 06:06.204
What we need to do is find him
before anything happens.

06:06.238 --> 06:07.672
You can help with that.

06:07.706 --> 06:12.577
How could he be alive
all these years and not call?

06:14.681 --> 06:16.648
When you say he's changed,

06:16.683 --> 06:20.986
that's the only reason
I believe you.

06:21.020 --> 06:22.755
Carrie?

06:22.789 --> 06:26.426
Will you send in
Mrs. Walker, please?

06:26.460 --> 06:29.095
He needs your help in there.

06:29.129 --> 06:31.363
Do you think you can do that?

06:49.649 --> 06:52.685
In Germany you said Walker
died in the middle of the night.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.821
He was killed, yes.

06:59.394 --> 07:00.761
Beaten to death?

07:00.795 --> 07:03.430
I didn't see it.
I heard it.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.798
But it was pretty clear.

07:04.832 --> 07:06.299
Then they made you bury him?

07:06.334 --> 07:08.235
Yeah, outside the compound.

07:08.269 --> 07:11.704
Just like I said in my original
debrief and a hundred times since.

07:11.739 --> 07:14.107
So you want to tell me
what this is all about?

07:14.141 --> 07:15.876
I'm just reconfirming.

07:15.910 --> 07:19.880
Oh, that's why they told me to
drop everything and rush in here.

07:19.914 --> 07:21.281
Well, his wife--

07:21.315 --> 07:26.486
widow-- she's trying
to close the file.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.421
Just trying to oblige.

07:28.456 --> 07:31.157
Like I said,

07:31.192 --> 07:33.026
mostly we were kept apart.

07:34.462 --> 07:38.131
All I know for sure
is he's dead.

07:41.602 --> 07:44.505
Thanks.
I got what I need.

07:44.539 --> 07:46.140
Thanks very much.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.451
I didn't say anything.

07:56.485 --> 07:58.920
Oh, so it's just a coincidence
that I've been dragged in here

07:58.954 --> 08:02.190
to go over Tom Walker's death just two
days after I told you I killed him?

08:02.224 --> 08:04.592
I didn't tell them what you
said. I would never do that.

08:04.627 --> 08:05.994
Then why am I here?

08:06.028 --> 08:08.763
I can't say.

08:08.797 --> 08:11.032
Oh, sure, of course not.
I can't.

08:11.066 --> 08:13.100
You know, for somebody
who lies all the time,

08:13.135 --> 08:14.802
I'd think you'd be better at it.

08:14.837 --> 08:16.004
Brody...

08:16.038 --> 08:17.539
Oh, please, just stop.

08:17.573 --> 08:19.641
I'm sorry.

08:19.675 --> 08:22.611
Fucking me to get information,

08:22.645 --> 08:25.148
is that part
of the job description?

08:25.182 --> 08:27.350
Or do you get a promotion
for showing initiative?

08:34.491 --> 08:37.058
What was that about?

08:37.094 --> 08:40.630
Nothing.

08:40.664 --> 08:44.700
He's mad about having to answer
the same questions over and over.

08:46.669 --> 08:48.203
Okay.

08:48.237 --> 08:51.706
He is. What?

08:51.741 --> 08:55.177
I think I got a lead
on Tom Walker. Interested?

08:55.211 --> 08:57.646
Come on.

09:22.541 --> 09:25.543
They called me back to Langley.

09:27.947 --> 09:31.215
To answer more questions
about Tom again.

09:31.250 --> 09:33.718
You don't have to explain
where you were.

09:40.559 --> 09:42.193
Jess,

09:42.228 --> 09:45.597
you have every right
to be mad at me.

09:45.631 --> 09:48.433
I know I've been impossible.

09:48.467 --> 09:51.703
And I know I can't just vanish for
two days without hurting you all.

09:51.737 --> 09:53.438
After eight years,
what's two more days?

09:53.472 --> 09:54.740
What's that supposed to mean?

09:54.774 --> 09:57.542
You don't even care?
Because I do.

10:05.853 --> 10:10.557
Brody, I hung on for six years.

10:13.094 --> 10:15.863
Six years after they told
me you were dead.

10:19.267 --> 10:21.268
Six years after a Marine
came to the door

10:21.302 --> 10:23.570
and said they were going
to start paying death benefits.

10:26.274 --> 10:27.674
I waited for you

10:27.709 --> 10:30.578
because I wanted so much
for you to be alive.

10:30.612 --> 10:34.948
Then I screwed up.

10:34.983 --> 10:38.785
I didn't wait long enough.
I screwed up.

10:38.820 --> 10:40.621
But I can't keep
paying for that.

10:40.655 --> 10:42.957
You don't have to.
I can't.

10:45.994 --> 10:47.995
Damn it.

10:48.030 --> 10:50.464
Chris will be home soon.

10:50.499 --> 10:52.299
It's not your fault.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.301
None of it is.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.307
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

11:04.644 --> 11:07.946
And I don't want
everything to fall apart.

11:18.258 --> 11:19.692
Remember what you
said about Walker

11:19.726 --> 11:23.997
when we found out he was
watching his son?

11:24.031 --> 11:27.968
You said his family
was his Achilles heel.

11:28.002 --> 11:31.672
That's what got me thinking about this.
About what, exactly?

11:31.707 --> 11:34.474
His son spots him at school.

11:34.509 --> 11:37.043
I thought maybe he'd try some
other form of contact.

11:37.078 --> 11:38.244
Well, I think he did.

11:38.279 --> 11:40.713
Okay, press "Enter."
It's right there.

11:40.748 --> 11:42.548
Okay...

11:42.583 --> 11:45.017
Phone records?
Helen Walker's phone records.

11:45.051 --> 11:46.518
Galvez got 'em for me.

11:46.552 --> 11:49.320
Turns out there's something
very interesting about them.

11:49.355 --> 11:50.655
Look at the time stamps.

11:50.689 --> 11:53.725
8:10, 8:08, 8:14, 8:11.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.194
All on weekdays.

11:55.228 --> 11:58.230
Made from various
disposable cell phones.

11:59.733 --> 12:02.402
S-So wait, Walker's been
talking to his wife?

12:02.436 --> 12:05.072
No. That's the point.

12:05.106 --> 12:07.374
At 8:00 a.m. she takes
the kid to school.

12:07.409 --> 12:09.043
The calls come in
when she's not there.

12:09.077 --> 12:11.445
Listen.
What is it?

12:14.449 --> 12:16.884
Just listen.

12:20.888 --> 12:22.956
Hey, this is Lucas.
And Helen.

12:22.990 --> 12:24.624
Please leave a message
after the tone,

12:24.658 --> 12:27.193
with your name and address,
and the time you called,

12:27.227 --> 12:29.061
and the date,
and why you called,

12:29.095 --> 12:30.729
and for who, and when...

12:30.763 --> 12:32.030
And we'll call you back.

12:32.065 --> 12:34.066
Depending on your answers.

12:36.070 --> 12:37.804
His Achilles heel.

12:39.774 --> 12:42.142
He calls just to
hear their voices.

12:43.612 --> 12:45.446
Who does?

12:45.481 --> 12:46.948
You can say;
he's cleared.

12:46.982 --> 12:48.883
This is Special Agent Hall,

12:48.918 --> 12:52.053
our FBI liaison on
the Walker task force.

12:52.088 --> 12:53.889
That phone message.

12:53.923 --> 12:56.458
It's Walker's wife Helen
and his son Lucas.

12:56.492 --> 12:59.394
He calls when he knows
they won't be there. Why?

12:59.428 --> 13:01.329
Well, like Saul said,
just to hear their voices

13:01.364 --> 13:03.597
on the answering machine.
To feel like he still belongs.

13:03.632 --> 13:06.333
This is how we find Walker.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.069
We get Helen to
pick up one morning.

13:08.103 --> 13:10.404
She draws him out
while we track the GPS.

13:10.438 --> 13:13.173
Well, how is her state of mind?
Think she can handle it?

13:13.207 --> 13:15.576
- I can get her there.
- That's your plan?

13:15.610 --> 13:17.945
You wait for him to call
and then cross your fingers

13:17.979 --> 13:19.613
that the wife doesn't
sink this whole mess

13:19.648 --> 13:21.015
by saying something
she shouldn't?

13:22.517 --> 13:24.151
I mean, we have
a critical situation here.

13:24.185 --> 13:27.121
A Marine sniper
turned by Abu Nazir,

13:27.155 --> 13:29.690
- on U.S. soil, targeting his own country.
- Yeah.

13:29.724 --> 13:31.359
That's what <i>we</i> told <i>you.</i>

13:31.393 --> 13:34.028
Agent Hall has
a suggestion how to proceed.

13:34.062 --> 13:35.696
I was just telling
the Assistant Director

13:35.731 --> 13:38.300
exactly how we tracked
down Whitey Bulger.

13:38.334 --> 13:40.702
Right. You put ads on TV.
We took the lead.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.505
We enlisted the public.

13:42.539 --> 13:44.140
What I'm saying is
there's things to do

13:44.175 --> 13:46.009
besides sitting here,
waiting for him to call us.

13:46.043 --> 13:47.644
Like you did with Whitey Bulger?

13:47.678 --> 13:50.014
Exactly.
Who it took you 20 years to find?

13:50.048 --> 13:52.951
Okay. So, uh,
we all know each other.

13:52.985 --> 13:54.885
Walker's out there,
we need to find him fast.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.520
Assess what our
approach should be,

13:56.555 --> 13:59.323
I'd like a recommendation
on my desk in two hours.

13:59.357 --> 14:01.759
Now, Agent Hall...

14:11.668 --> 14:13.336
Somebody gonna get that?

14:13.370 --> 14:14.737
How about you?
I'm not getting it,

14:14.771 --> 14:17.006
Not anymore.

14:17.041 --> 14:18.541
Watch this.

14:18.575 --> 14:21.644
Whoa! Well, I'm out.
I'll get it.

14:21.678 --> 14:23.846
Where are all these aces coming from?
I don't know.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.148
I'm good at this game.

14:26.182 --> 14:27.716
Hello?

14:27.750 --> 14:29.017
Mrs. Gaines.

14:30.453 --> 14:33.187
All right... Elizabeth.

14:33.222 --> 14:34.722
Uh-huh.
Yes, of course.

14:34.757 --> 14:36.091
Who's Mrs. Gaines?

14:36.125 --> 14:38.527
You know. That lady at church
with the chauffeur.

14:38.561 --> 14:42.064
What's a chauffeur again?
Like, one of those little dogs?

14:42.098 --> 14:46.001
I swear to God, you're like
a half idiot, half moron.

14:46.036 --> 14:47.403
Dana.

14:47.437 --> 14:48.671
Well, seriously.

14:48.705 --> 14:50.773
I'll ask.

14:53.144 --> 14:55.445
She says she invited us
to a party tomorrow night.

14:55.479 --> 14:58.215
Oh, she did. I forgot
to get back to her.

14:58.249 --> 15:00.384
I'm supposed to tell you
we're gonna look back on it

15:00.418 --> 15:01.618
as the party of the year.

15:01.653 --> 15:03.420
What does that mean?

15:06.424 --> 15:08.659
I don't know.
Do you want to go?

15:10.495 --> 15:11.729
We don't have to.

15:11.763 --> 15:13.030
Are you guys joking?

15:13.064 --> 15:16.734
Elizabeth Gaines promises
the party of the year,

15:16.768 --> 15:18.403
and you're actually thinking
about not going?

15:20.640 --> 15:23.875
Well, I'm going if you're not.

15:23.909 --> 15:26.310
Okay.

15:27.979 --> 15:29.212
Uh, we'd love to.

15:29.247 --> 15:30.447
Thank you.

15:30.481 --> 15:33.217
Wow.

15:33.251 --> 15:35.619
Thank you very much.

15:35.654 --> 15:37.054
She's sending a car.

15:37.089 --> 15:39.257
Around 7:00.
A car?

15:40.659 --> 15:43.061
Dad, when something
good happens,

15:43.095 --> 15:45.163
you just gotta
learn to say yes.

15:48.634 --> 15:50.235
I've never heard
you say anything

15:50.270 --> 15:51.937
remotely nice about Elizabeth.

15:51.971 --> 15:54.439
How come we suddenly have to
go to one of her parties?

15:54.473 --> 15:56.441
'Cause the alternative is
sitting here watching you pack.

15:56.475 --> 15:57.842
I have to.

15:57.877 --> 15:59.111
No, you don't.

15:59.145 --> 16:01.413
I leave the day after tomorrow.

16:01.447 --> 16:03.081
You don't have to leave,
that's my point.

16:04.850 --> 16:06.083
All your friends will be there.

16:06.117 --> 16:08.252
I know.

16:08.286 --> 16:09.653
You can explain to them.

16:09.687 --> 16:12.189
The necessity of this
precipitous departure.

16:12.223 --> 16:14.091
Saul... 'Cause I can't,
for the life of me,

16:14.125 --> 16:15.593
after 25 years together?
I don't understand.

16:15.627 --> 16:17.028
Is this how you're going to be?

16:17.062 --> 16:18.830
Because I can't take
a whole evening of it.

16:18.864 --> 16:20.765
I'm going to be this way
whether we go out or not.

16:20.799 --> 16:22.334
The difference is at Elizabeth's
they'll be serving champagne.

16:22.368 --> 16:25.004
Okay. We go.
For old times' sake.

16:25.038 --> 16:26.672
But my flight does
leave the next morning.

16:26.707 --> 16:29.042
Right.
And I'm going to be on it.

16:29.076 --> 16:31.044
Right, right, right, right.
I heard you.

16:34.082 --> 16:35.315
What?

16:35.349 --> 16:37.117
Are you okay?

16:37.151 --> 16:38.552
I'm a little busy, actually.

16:40.154 --> 16:41.354
Can I come in?

16:50.565 --> 16:53.301
Estes put me in charge
of the task force.

16:53.335 --> 16:55.303
Congratulations.
Yeah, to you.

16:55.337 --> 16:57.305
It was on your recommendation.

16:57.339 --> 16:59.507
And because of the phone idea,
which was also yours

16:59.542 --> 17:01.910
but somehow became mine when
you handed it to me today.

17:04.180 --> 17:05.481
This can't wait?

17:05.515 --> 17:07.884
No.

17:09.752 --> 17:11.554
Saul, you look out for me.

17:11.589 --> 17:13.522
You always have...

17:13.557 --> 17:15.723
and...

17:15.759 --> 17:18.727
You saw me arguing with
Brody earlier today.

17:20.563 --> 17:23.763
I wasn't honest
with you about that.

17:23.799 --> 17:25.733
Yeah.

17:25.767 --> 17:27.901
I kind of got that.

17:29.704 --> 17:33.173
When the surveillance on
Brody was shut down...

17:33.207 --> 17:35.542
I contacted him.

17:37.778 --> 17:39.612
Personally.

17:41.382 --> 17:42.749
How personally?

17:44.785 --> 17:47.187
At a support group first.

17:49.957 --> 17:51.190
And then we saw each other.

17:51.225 --> 17:52.992
A few times.

17:56.230 --> 17:58.297
Look, I was chasing
the wrong guy.

17:58.332 --> 18:00.733
"Chasing," good word for it.

18:02.402 --> 18:04.203
Well, it's...

18:04.237 --> 18:07.639
it's moot, now.
It's over.

18:10.342 --> 18:12.810
It should never have happened.

18:14.413 --> 18:15.780
Do you get that?

18:15.815 --> 18:18.583
Yeah, I do.

18:18.618 --> 18:21.020
Why else would I be here?

18:23.257 --> 18:26.759
And like I said, it's over.

18:32.266 --> 18:34.167
You okay?

18:34.202 --> 18:36.569
Yeah, I'll survive.

18:38.472 --> 18:41.741
Well, with any luck Tom Walker
calls his wife tomorrow morning,

18:41.776 --> 18:43.810
we track him down and
we're all heroes by noon.

18:48.849 --> 18:50.149
Come on.

18:50.183 --> 18:51.450
Get some sleep.

18:51.485 --> 18:53.485
See you tomorrow.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.631
Saul. We're good here.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.766
The son's just
leaving for school.

19:06.801 --> 19:07.868
Helen Walker?

19:07.902 --> 19:09.369
She seems okay.

19:09.404 --> 19:11.671
I was about to give her
a last-minute pep talk.

19:11.706 --> 19:13.340
Great. We're good to go then.

19:13.375 --> 19:15.276
You sound jazzed.

19:15.310 --> 19:17.444
Better than last night, anyway.

19:17.478 --> 19:19.446
I was weaned on
inter-agency noncooperation.

19:19.480 --> 19:22.049
Nothing makes me happier than
seeing the FBI stand around

19:22.083 --> 19:24.318
with their dicks in their hands,
watching us work.

19:26.155 --> 19:27.389
Lovely.

19:31.494 --> 19:33.662
They're ready to
trace the call.

19:33.696 --> 19:35.297
If it's even him.

19:35.331 --> 19:36.866
It will be.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.633
When he calls,
you need to engage him.

19:38.668 --> 19:39.868
Keep him talking.

19:39.903 --> 19:41.470
So you can find him.

19:41.504 --> 19:43.205
So we can help him.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.808
Is that what everyone on
this task force is saying,

19:45.843 --> 19:47.377
"let's help Tom Walker"?

19:47.411 --> 19:49.479
Helen, it's important
you understand.

19:49.514 --> 19:51.882
He hasn't done anything
wrong, not yet.

19:51.916 --> 19:53.850
We're all working
to keep it that way.

19:59.690 --> 20:02.692
Okay, we're a little early here.
Are you set?

20:04.395 --> 20:06.729
Talk to me. What the hell
sort of trace is that?

20:06.764 --> 20:08.898
Wild routing through
a series of numbers.

20:08.932 --> 20:12.068
Two continents so far.
Okay, just hit Mumbai.

20:12.102 --> 20:14.170
She needs to pick up
before it goes to voicemail.

20:14.204 --> 20:15.738
Helen.

20:15.772 --> 20:18.074
Helen, you need to get that.

20:28.552 --> 20:30.052
Hello?

20:30.087 --> 20:32.121
Hi. This is Diane.

20:32.155 --> 20:35.725
Do you need your carpets professionally steam-cleaned?
Okay, cut this, please.

20:35.759 --> 20:37.259
Well, we have a special
offer just for you.

20:37.293 --> 20:40.195
Right now you can get
up to five rooms

20:40.230 --> 20:41.363
professi...
Cut it.

20:41.397 --> 20:43.732
Thank you.
Reset, please.

20:54.410 --> 20:56.945
There, see?
You can do it.

20:56.979 --> 20:59.381
I can't. I don't even
know what to say.

20:59.415 --> 21:01.149
He misses you.
And Lucas.

21:01.183 --> 21:02.717
That's why he calls.

21:02.752 --> 21:05.119
You need to show him you
feel the same way. How?

21:05.154 --> 21:08.156
By saying I gave up,
got remarried? No.

21:08.191 --> 21:10.058
By saying you've
told Lucas about him,

21:10.092 --> 21:11.960
you've shown him pictures,

21:11.995 --> 21:14.563
enough that he actually
recognized him.

21:14.597 --> 21:17.133
You've kept him alive
in your son's thoughts.

21:17.167 --> 21:20.603
When Tom calls...

21:20.638 --> 21:23.006
tell him that.

21:38.555 --> 21:40.456
Hello?

21:50.399 --> 21:52.300
Fuck. He hung up.

21:52.334 --> 21:54.669
I don't see any GPS data.
Tell me we have something.

21:54.703 --> 21:57.639
Signal originated at cell towers
in northeast D.C.

21:57.674 --> 21:59.608
Call was most likely made
within a mile of there.

21:59.642 --> 22:01.944
So what do we have on
street cams in the area?

22:01.978 --> 22:04.012
Ivy City, coverage is sketchy.

22:04.046 --> 22:05.380
Well, let's see it, come on.

22:06.916 --> 22:08.617
Where's facial recognition?

22:08.651 --> 22:11.086
There you go.
Again.

22:40.951 --> 22:44.854
Chris. What are you doing?

22:44.888 --> 22:47.857
I don't want to miss the car.

22:47.892 --> 22:50.060
It's a hired driver,
he'll come to the door.

22:50.094 --> 22:52.229
It's not like he's trying
to avoid detection.

22:53.698 --> 22:56.066
Have you noticed?

22:56.100 --> 22:58.502
What?

22:58.536 --> 23:01.637
They're not fighting.

23:06.543 --> 23:07.876
He's here.

23:07.911 --> 23:09.678
Mom! Dad!

23:09.712 --> 23:11.446
The driver's here!

23:11.481 --> 23:14.750
Sweet! Come on,
check it out!

23:23.126 --> 23:25.393
So. How do we look?

23:25.428 --> 23:28.864
Swear to God,
I must be adopted.

23:39.942 --> 23:42.342
You look beautiful.

23:46.747 --> 23:48.548
You can stop staring now.

23:48.582 --> 23:50.116
I'm not.
Yes, you are.

23:50.150 --> 23:51.584
I can feel it.

23:53.287 --> 23:55.755
So do you, by the way.
You look handsome.

23:55.789 --> 23:59.159
Who's gonna tell me that when
you're halfway around the world?

24:01.363 --> 24:04.766
We're chasing this guy at work.

24:04.800 --> 24:08.170
20 of us from Langley
plus the FBI.

24:08.204 --> 24:09.605
He's got this fatal flaw,

24:09.639 --> 24:12.007
this weakness
we're trying to exploit.

24:12.042 --> 24:13.609
Carrie calls it
his "Achilles heel."

24:13.643 --> 24:14.777
What is it?

24:17.347 --> 24:19.848
He loves his wife.

24:27.656 --> 24:33.961
♪ Let someone start
believing in you ♪

24:33.995 --> 24:36.931
♪ Let him hold out his hand ♪

24:36.965 --> 24:39.367
♪ Let him touch you... ♪

24:39.401 --> 24:40.769
Hi, there.

24:40.803 --> 24:42.838
♪ And watch what happens ♪

24:42.872 --> 24:44.272
There she is.

24:46.809 --> 24:47.975
Oh, will you excuse me?

24:48.010 --> 24:50.479
Sure. Okay.

24:50.513 --> 24:52.814
Saul, Mira.

24:52.848 --> 24:57.051
Good to see you two
together, finally.

24:57.085 --> 24:58.719
It must be great to have
her back.

24:58.754 --> 25:00.054
I hope she never leaves.

25:01.657 --> 25:03.724
He's even crankier than usual
when you're gone.

25:03.759 --> 25:06.727
Do us a favor,
stay put this year.

25:08.063 --> 25:10.030
Is that Vivian?

25:10.064 --> 25:11.998
Excuse me.

25:13.267 --> 25:14.333
Well...

25:14.368 --> 25:16.670
did I accidentally hit a nerve?

25:16.704 --> 25:18.672
Accidentally?

25:18.706 --> 25:21.542
I doubt it.

25:21.576 --> 25:25.179
Well, I may have heard rumors.

25:25.213 --> 25:27.248
Oh, my God! Look at them.

25:28.684 --> 25:30.518
Excuse me.

25:31.921 --> 25:33.255
Don't you look lovely.

25:33.289 --> 25:34.723
Thank you.

25:34.757 --> 25:36.925
Thank you for sending the car.
You didn't have to.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.094
Oh, well, I wanted to be sure

25:39.128 --> 25:40.362
you actually made
an appearance.

25:40.397 --> 25:41.897
Saul?

25:41.932 --> 25:44.100
Do you know Saul?

25:44.134 --> 25:47.237
Yes. Yes, we've met.

25:47.271 --> 25:48.705
A couple times.

25:48.739 --> 25:49.773
This is my wife Jessica.

25:49.807 --> 25:51.675
Saul Berenson.
Hi.

25:51.709 --> 25:53.109
The bar's through there.

25:53.143 --> 25:54.777
Grab a drink and
I'll introduce you around.

25:54.812 --> 25:56.846
Thank you.
Thanks.

25:58.582 --> 26:01.117
♪ ♪

26:03.954 --> 26:05.888
Elizabeth...

26:05.923 --> 26:09.091
you have that look.

26:09.126 --> 26:12.896
Well, they are perfect,
aren't they?

26:12.930 --> 26:16.066
For what? What are you up to?

26:16.100 --> 26:17.801
You've been poking around
about Brody

26:17.835 --> 26:21.572
ever since he became the
poster child for D.O.D.

26:21.606 --> 26:23.907
You have some plan
in the works for him.

26:23.942 --> 26:26.910
Oh, I have a plan for
everyone, you know that.

26:26.945 --> 26:28.479
You're grooming him.

26:28.513 --> 26:30.714
For what exactly?

26:30.748 --> 26:33.283
By the end of the evening
you just might find out.

26:46.798 --> 26:49.332
All tucked in...
finally.

26:49.366 --> 26:52.501
I've never heard so many
reasons not to go to bed.

26:52.536 --> 26:53.969
Oh, he's not even asleep yet.

26:54.004 --> 26:55.738
Matt's up there reading
to him right now.

26:55.773 --> 26:58.342
He seems very devoted
to your son, Matt does.

26:58.376 --> 27:00.744
You were lucky to find him.

27:00.779 --> 27:03.280
Yeah, I was, very.

27:07.018 --> 27:09.421
And despite everything,

27:09.455 --> 27:13.291
being married to Tom,
that was lucky, too.

27:16.329 --> 27:18.764
I mean having him in my life,

27:18.798 --> 27:21.033
those years before he left.

27:25.538 --> 27:27.839
What about you?

27:27.873 --> 27:29.941
Me?

27:29.975 --> 27:31.309
Who's in your life?

27:35.815 --> 27:38.684
Oh, I met somebody.

27:38.719 --> 27:42.222
But I don't think
it's gonna work out.

27:46.395 --> 27:49.330
<i>So that's what</i>
<i>we're tasked with, my squad,</i>

27:49.365 --> 27:51.499
to safeguard this,
this artwork,

27:51.534 --> 27:52.834
I guess you'd call it.

27:52.868 --> 27:56.171
It's in the one
presidential palace

27:56.205 --> 27:58.240
that's still held by the enemy.

27:58.274 --> 27:59.975
So we shoot our way
into the palace,

28:00.009 --> 28:03.645
we engage multiple targets
down this long hall.

28:03.679 --> 28:06.214
We finally get into the
room where this is,

28:06.248 --> 28:09.417
this-this national treasure
we've risked our lives for,

28:09.451 --> 28:12.353
this solid gold bust
of Saddam...

28:12.388 --> 28:15.356
and somebody's already replaced
it with a Mr. Potato Head.

28:23.967 --> 28:26.168
Will you excuse me, gentlemen,
for one second?

28:26.203 --> 28:28.204
Sure.
Thank you.

28:28.238 --> 28:30.072
Would you excuse me?

28:34.912 --> 28:36.779
Okay, I have to ask.

28:36.814 --> 28:38.414
I know what you're gonna say.

28:38.449 --> 28:40.049
So I'm not imagining.
Everyone's...

28:40.083 --> 28:42.385
being really nice to us, yes.

28:42.419 --> 28:46.088
It's weird. And that guy...

28:46.123 --> 28:49.725
Head of the Democratic
National Committee.

28:49.759 --> 28:51.561
His wife practically jumped me.

28:51.595 --> 28:53.596
She said, "I want you
to think of me..."

28:53.630 --> 28:54.931
"...of me as
your new best friend"?

28:54.965 --> 28:55.965
Exactly.

28:55.999 --> 28:57.933
What's going on?

28:57.968 --> 29:00.069
I don't know.

29:02.505 --> 29:03.705
Want to get some air?

29:03.740 --> 29:05.007
Yes.

29:11.848 --> 29:14.083
What are you thinking about?

29:14.117 --> 29:17.586
I'm thinking about
all the things

29:17.620 --> 29:20.389
that happen in people's lives...

29:20.423 --> 29:23.960
that pull them together
or split them apart.

29:23.994 --> 29:27.830
The million little events,

29:27.865 --> 29:29.999
coincidences...

29:30.034 --> 29:32.802
the outside forces.

29:35.772 --> 29:38.007
Mira leaves tomorrow, right?

29:41.110 --> 29:44.246
I've been there myself, Saul.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.480
Three times.

29:45.514 --> 29:48.416
I know what it looks like,

29:48.450 --> 29:49.918
what it feels like.

29:49.952 --> 29:53.354
If you ever need
to talk to somebody,

29:53.389 --> 29:58.027
believe it or not,
I'm a good listener.

30:04.468 --> 30:10.074
You know, you were asking what
Brody's being groomed for.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.210
You're about to find out.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.812
Make yourself useful.

30:14.846 --> 30:17.114
Get the Brodys to the library.

30:20.085 --> 30:22.820
Capitol Hill is
calculating the political fallout

30:22.854 --> 30:24.555
following the press conference

30:24.589 --> 30:27.224
by Eighth District Congressman
Richard Johnson

30:27.258 --> 30:29.159
caught in
a sexting scandal, sending nude

30:29.193 --> 30:31.794
and seminude pictures
of himself

30:31.829 --> 30:34.130
to a number of
Congressional interns,

30:34.165 --> 30:36.200
charges he vehemently denies.

30:36.234 --> 30:39.036
This is a setup, a persecution.

30:39.070 --> 30:41.505
The facts will show these
accusations

30:41.540 --> 30:43.841
to be completely without merit.

30:43.875 --> 30:47.078
My wife and I are gonna get
through this together.

30:47.113 --> 30:51.550
And no, I have absolutely no
intention of deserting

30:51.585 --> 30:55.321
my office or the voters
who put me there.

30:55.355 --> 30:58.390
The Congressman pledged
to disprove the allegations

30:58.425 --> 30:59.892
and serve out his term.

30:59.926 --> 31:00.993
House Minority Leader

31:01.027 --> 31:03.596
Ellen Randall expressed
disappointment

31:03.630 --> 31:06.566
at the news and has called
for an Ethics Committee

31:06.600 --> 31:10.336
investigation to determine
whether any other violation...

31:10.371 --> 31:12.771
He'll be gone in two days.

31:12.806 --> 31:14.607
I have an idea who
might replace him.

31:14.641 --> 31:16.875
The impact of the scandal
on Johnson's status

31:16.910 --> 31:19.078
as Chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee.

31:19.112 --> 31:22.214
The Congressman has been
a fierce opponent

31:22.248 --> 31:25.050
of the administration's efforts
to allocate more funding

31:25.084 --> 31:26.919
for unmanned surveillance

31:26.953 --> 31:29.221
and drone strikes in
the Middle East.

31:35.595 --> 31:37.596
"Dick Johnson?" Really?

31:37.630 --> 31:39.531
That's his name.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.933
Well, he should think
about changing it

31:41.968 --> 31:45.036
if he's gonna be doing
stuff like that!

31:45.071 --> 31:47.373
You're drunk.

31:47.407 --> 31:50.242
Not as drunk as I bet Dick
Johnson is right now!

31:57.284 --> 32:00.287
You saw how everyone
was looking at you, right?

32:00.321 --> 32:02.088
They were looking at you.

32:02.123 --> 32:03.957
They were looking at you.

32:09.465 --> 32:13.802
This was a... really nice
date, Sergeant Brody.

32:15.938 --> 32:18.339
You showed me
a really good time.

32:26.013 --> 32:27.781
Dick Johnson.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.136
Wow. My feet are killing me.
Oh, shh!

32:49.572 --> 32:50.938
How was it?

32:50.973 --> 32:52.440
Fancy.

32:52.474 --> 32:54.976
You guys said you'd be
in bed by 11:00.

32:55.011 --> 32:56.678
It's <i>Ice Age,</i> Mom.

32:56.713 --> 32:59.515
I think I missed this one.

32:59.549 --> 33:01.117
Not one. You missed,
like, three.

33:01.152 --> 33:03.119
What's wrong with the elephant?

33:03.154 --> 33:04.688
It's a woolly mammoth, Dad.

33:04.722 --> 33:06.523
Shh!

33:06.558 --> 33:09.127
Here. Move over.
I'm coming in.

33:11.864 --> 33:13.232
Your arm okay?

33:13.266 --> 33:14.900
Hmm...

33:19.072 --> 33:20.472
Mmm, popcorn.

33:20.507 --> 33:22.374
I'll have some of that.

33:24.177 --> 33:25.377
Mmm.

33:37.557 --> 33:38.924
Hello?

33:43.797 --> 33:45.297
Tom, is that you?

33:48.301 --> 33:50.469
Tom?

33:53.974 --> 33:57.209
Lucas said he thought
he saw you

33:57.244 --> 33:58.744
at his school.

33:58.779 --> 34:01.381
Holy shit!

34:03.583 --> 34:04.950
Hey, Carrie, we're live.

34:04.985 --> 34:06.218
You sure?

34:06.253 --> 34:08.387
Yeah.
I didn't hear it ring.

34:10.556 --> 34:13.292
Notify the FBI team on the
ground, then patch me in.

34:18.964 --> 34:19.697
Where's Helen?

34:19.731 --> 34:21.299
I don't know.

34:22.934 --> 34:26.437
Saul, we're on. Get up.

34:26.471 --> 34:28.906
I am, Carrie. I'm up.

34:37.616 --> 34:39.850
No GPS data.

34:42.152 --> 34:44.554
Phone must have it blocked.

34:44.589 --> 34:46.757
Well, get past it so I'm not
just guessing here.

34:46.792 --> 34:47.958
Okay, I'm on it.

34:51.362 --> 34:53.496
You don't have to say anything.

34:53.531 --> 34:56.900
I know you're listening.

34:56.934 --> 34:58.835
I can feel you there.

34:59.937 --> 35:02.839
Okay, I think we're there.

35:02.873 --> 35:04.173
Got it.

35:04.207 --> 35:05.341
Tac One,

35:05.375 --> 35:06.976
immediate left onto
New York Avenue.

35:07.010 --> 35:08.510
Proceed five blocks, then left.

35:12.114 --> 35:13.748
And I need you to know

35:13.783 --> 35:16.318
that I never gave up on you,

35:16.352 --> 35:19.822
I never lost hope.

35:19.856 --> 35:22.859
But Lucas,
he was getting so big...

35:24.829 --> 35:28.466
And a boy needs a father,
that's what you always said.

35:28.500 --> 35:33.772
And it... it wasn't enough,
me raising him on my own...

35:33.806 --> 35:36.842
not if he was to have a future.

35:36.876 --> 35:38.844
Our son.

35:41.581 --> 35:44.883
But I never stopped
loving you...

35:44.918 --> 35:46.718
never.

35:46.753 --> 35:49.955
Not for one second.

35:49.989 --> 35:51.723
And when Lucas said he thought

35:51.758 --> 35:53.959
he'd seen you
that day at his school,

35:53.993 --> 35:56.895
my heart was so glad.

35:56.929 --> 36:01.166
Just the thought of it
was a miracle.

36:01.200 --> 36:07.172
And I don't care
why you're back, I don't.

36:07.207 --> 36:08.940
Just that you are.

36:10.109 --> 36:12.911
Helen.

36:16.616 --> 36:19.318
Oh, baby, I've done
a horrible thing.

36:19.352 --> 36:21.888
No, Helen, no. Don't! Don't!
They're tracing this call!

36:21.922 --> 36:23.322
You got to get out of there!

36:23.357 --> 36:24.657
You hear me?!

36:24.691 --> 36:26.125
Get out now!

36:38.371 --> 36:39.537
Patch me into the tac team.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.938
Okay, you're connected.

36:40.973 --> 36:43.375
Do not lose the target!
He's not the target!

36:43.409 --> 36:44.809
He's my husband!

36:50.750 --> 36:52.350
Okay, what's your position?

36:52.385 --> 36:54.786
Okie Street pushing east. He's
moving towards the rail yard.

36:54.820 --> 36:57.389
Negative. That position
would be too exposed.

36:57.423 --> 36:58.857
We've got a sighting.

36:58.891 --> 37:00.758
No, he'll stay
where there's cover.

37:04.162 --> 37:05.229
Hello?

37:07.832 --> 37:10.366
Galvez, what just happened?
I'm not sure.

37:10.401 --> 37:11.968
I think Tac One is down.
Where?

37:15.071 --> 37:16.472
What is his position?

37:16.506 --> 37:17.873
Mount Olivet Street.

37:17.908 --> 37:18.974
Olivet.

37:19.009 --> 37:21.377
Okay, they're on him.

37:21.411 --> 37:22.445
Following.

37:27.684 --> 37:29.451
Target in sight.

37:29.486 --> 37:30.486
No.

37:30.520 --> 37:31.821
Wait.
What do you mean?

37:34.658 --> 37:36.459
They need to flank him
on the next street.

37:36.494 --> 37:37.828
Contain him, but stay back.

37:41.533 --> 37:43.401
Galvez, tell me you copy.

37:43.435 --> 37:46.437
It's too late. They're in.

37:55.180 --> 37:56.914
He's running!

38:03.154 --> 38:04.587
Gun!

38:07.458 --> 38:09.592
FBI! Do not move!

38:09.626 --> 38:13.095
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands now!

38:13.130 --> 38:16.466
FBI! Do not move!
Do not move!

38:16.501 --> 38:19.202
Do not move!

38:36.823 --> 38:39.124
Folks, I need you to stay back.

38:47.734 --> 38:50.669
Stay back, all of you.
Behind the barricade.

39:01.248 --> 39:05.552
Anyone care to tell
me what happened?

39:07.455 --> 39:09.556
The tac team followed
Walker here.

39:09.590 --> 39:10.857
Two casualties.

39:10.892 --> 39:13.160
Local Muslims here
for morning prayer.

39:13.194 --> 39:15.596
We cleared the building,
including the Imam.

39:15.630 --> 39:17.731
I think I saw him outside.
Looked very unhappy.

39:17.766 --> 39:19.700
Walker assaulted
our team leader.

39:19.734 --> 39:21.168
Took his weapon.

39:21.202 --> 39:23.337
Operating theory is
that he fired first.

39:23.371 --> 39:24.738
That's very much in dispute.

39:24.772 --> 39:27.340
Where's Walker?

39:27.375 --> 39:30.109
<i>We're looking.</i>

39:30.143 --> 39:32.044
<i>Meaning you have no idea.</i>

39:32.078 --> 39:34.746
<i>We were right on top of him.
</i> <i>We'll find him again.</i>

39:34.781 --> 39:36.215
<i>It better be soon.</i>

40:06.645 --> 40:08.045
This is a nightmare.

40:08.079 --> 40:09.880
I couldn't agree more.

40:12.751 --> 40:14.152
Suggestions?

40:14.186 --> 40:16.821
The way I see it,
we're down to one option.

40:16.855 --> 40:18.489
We go public about Walker.

40:18.524 --> 40:20.091
Appeal for help finding him.

40:20.125 --> 40:21.659
And what about
what happened here?

40:21.694 --> 40:25.130
Call him a terrorist.
What happened here won't matter much.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.767
Saul?

40:36.944 --> 40:40.179
I'll draft the language.

40:40.213 --> 40:41.446
Let's regroup at Langley.

40:41.481 --> 40:43.081
The sooner we get this
done, the better.

41:04.904 --> 41:07.006
Who is it?

41:07.040 --> 41:09.775
It's okay.

41:09.810 --> 41:12.044
Go back to sleep.

41:22.221 --> 41:24.555
What are you doing here?

41:24.589 --> 41:26.524
There's something
you need to know.

41:26.558 --> 41:28.392
Not at 6:00 in the morning.

41:28.427 --> 41:32.162
Tom Walker is alive.

41:36.100 --> 41:37.500
You're lying.
No.

41:37.534 --> 41:39.202
It's not possible.
It's true.

41:39.236 --> 41:42.037
I killed him with my own
hands, just like I told you.

41:42.072 --> 41:45.241
No. Abu Nazir made
you think you did.

41:45.275 --> 41:47.977
There's a manhunt on
for Walker.

41:48.011 --> 41:50.246
He's somewhere in the area.

41:50.281 --> 41:52.849
We're going public with the
information in a few hours.

41:52.884 --> 41:54.785
I thought you deserved
to hear it first.

41:56.688 --> 41:59.089
I wanted to tell you
at Langley, but I couldn't.

41:59.124 --> 42:01.325
It was still classified.

42:01.360 --> 42:04.662
But I need you to know that I did not
betray your confidence to anyone.

42:04.696 --> 42:07.465
I would never do that.

42:09.869 --> 42:14.105
I knew for a fact an American
P.O.W. Was turned.

42:14.140 --> 42:17.242
I didn't know Walker was still
alive any more than you did.

42:17.276 --> 42:19.377
Don't hate me because
I thought it was you.

42:19.411 --> 42:22.780
I don't hate you.

42:22.814 --> 42:25.549
You just did what you had to.

42:27.719 --> 42:30.453
Just did your job.

42:30.488 --> 42:32.522
No, it wasn't just my job.

42:55.346 --> 42:57.580
Is she...?
CIA.

43:15.833 --> 43:20.636
Mira, I'm so sorry.

43:20.671 --> 43:23.805
We had a severe meltdown.
Two innocents were killed.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.107
Muslims waiting
for morning prayers.

43:25.141 --> 43:27.009
I got it, I got it, I got it.

43:27.044 --> 43:28.911
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.

43:28.946 --> 43:31.247
I said I'd be here to make breakfast,
take you to the airport.

43:31.282 --> 43:34.317
I'm already late, Saul.
I'm here now. I'm here.

43:34.351 --> 43:36.319
It's better I take a cab.

43:38.389 --> 43:42.325
You know how far it is
from here to Delhi?

43:42.360 --> 43:44.427
7,503 miles.

43:44.462 --> 43:46.696
Well, we're still
going to talk.

43:46.730 --> 43:48.698
Sure.

43:48.732 --> 43:50.099
I'll text you.

43:52.969 --> 43:55.671
Please don't do this.

43:58.876 --> 44:02.812
When I woke up this morning,
Saul, you were gone,

44:02.847 --> 44:08.319
and it hit me that there hasn't
been one day since I've been home

44:08.353 --> 44:09.954
that you were there at night

44:09.988 --> 44:11.789
and then you were still
there the next morning.

44:11.824 --> 44:15.827
And I couldn't even remember
when was the last time

44:15.861 --> 44:18.296
you were home
for 12 straight hours.

44:18.330 --> 44:21.499
And I don't think
you could remember either.

44:26.905 --> 44:27.972
It's my weakness.

44:29.173 --> 44:32.175
My Achilles heel.

44:32.210 --> 44:35.412
Every time they'd
call me, I'd go.

44:49.763 --> 44:52.164
I'm gonna miss my plane.

45:38.513 --> 45:41.282
The first news reports
about Walker

45:41.316 --> 45:43.150
hit the air less
than five hours ago.

45:43.185 --> 45:47.588
We've already had
nearly 2,000 sightings.

45:47.623 --> 45:51.225
All of them probably nothing.

45:51.259 --> 45:56.463
If I'm Walker I'm burrowing
into my hole right now.

45:57.665 --> 45:59.466
Carrie?

46:02.337 --> 46:06.840
We're going to have tips
a mile deep by morning.

46:06.874 --> 46:09.976
It'll be tough to wade through.

46:10.011 --> 46:12.278
We'll need to prioritize.

46:16.217 --> 46:18.919
I had a kind of epiphany today.

46:18.953 --> 46:20.454
About Walker?

46:20.488 --> 46:23.190
I wish.

46:23.225 --> 46:26.193
No, about me.

46:32.468 --> 46:37.539
I'm going to be alone
my whole life, aren't I?

47:07.605 --> 47:10.040
♪ ♪

47:24.789 --> 47:27.190
Fault, zone two.

47:47.948 --> 47:49.615
A war hero,
and now he's at the top

47:49.649 --> 47:52.051
of the FBI's Most Wanted List.

47:52.085 --> 47:54.720
Could this be just an
extreme case of PTSD,

47:54.755 --> 47:57.890
or is Walker a member
of al-Qaeda?

47:57.925 --> 47:59.926
This isn't some troubled vet.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.061
The FBI called Walker
a credible threat

48:02.096 --> 48:03.630
with ties to subversive
elements.

48:03.664 --> 48:05.899
Right here in D.
C.? That's correct.

48:05.933 --> 48:09.035
Walker?
Are you crazy?

48:09.070 --> 48:10.637
The entire country is
looking for you.

48:10.671 --> 48:12.038
You can't be here.

48:12.073 --> 48:14.607
You people told
me Walker was dead.

48:26.020 --> 48:27.254
My friend.

48:27.288 --> 48:29.757
You told me I killed him.

48:29.791 --> 48:31.324
You made me believe.

48:31.359 --> 48:32.392
I don't know!

48:33.828 --> 48:36.797
Really, really!
You have to talk to Abu Nazir!

48:38.767 --> 48:40.834
I'm through talking with Nazir,

48:40.869 --> 48:43.103
and you can tell him that.

48:45.040 --> 48:47.141
Tell him it's over.
