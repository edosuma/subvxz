01:49.920 --> 01:52.713
Based upon the book by Dr. Seuss

02:05.693 --> 02:12.155
HORTON

03:23.345 --> 03:25.104
On the fifteenth of May

03:25.104 --> 03:26.622
in the jungle of Nool

03:26.622 --> 03:28.030
in the heat of the day

03:28.030 --> 03:29.814
in the cool of the pool

03:29.814 --> 03:33.940
He was splashing
enjoying the jungle's great joys.

03:36.324 --> 03:40.403
And Horton, the elephant
heard a small noise.

03:50.074 --> 03:51.545
- Horton!
- Horton!

03:52.241 --> 03:54.188
Good morning, class.
Are you ready?

03:54.188 --> 03:55.107
Yeah!

03:55.107 --> 03:56.699
Jump on board!

03:57.071 --> 03:58.425
Look out, below!

03:58.861 --> 04:00.164
Tommy's on board.

04:00.164 --> 04:01.931
Katie, you there?

04:02.976 --> 04:06.365
- Ha-Ah-A.
- O.K.

04:08.128 --> 04:09.867
There it is.

04:09.867 --> 04:12.554
This is one of the jungle's
most amazing creatures.

04:12.554 --> 04:13.921
The leaf bug.

04:14.096 --> 04:16.075
In order to protect itself from predators

04:16.075 --> 04:18.837
It disguises itself as a leaf

04:24.404 --> 04:26.170
This one's got quite a deep grip.

04:26.170 --> 04:29.195
Come on, little buddy!
Don't be shy!

04:31.350 --> 04:33.264
I guess I was mistaken, Kids.

04:33.835 --> 04:36.323
There are obviously no leaf bugs in this area.

04:36.323 --> 04:38.918
- Oh, yeah.
- Even a per... Oh! They're on me.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.162
Look at, there are bugs

04:43.757 --> 04:44.916
I think I swallowed it.

04:44.916 --> 04:47.054
Shoot up!
Uh-ek it's not coming.

04:47.054 --> 04:47.905
Pull it out.

04:47.905 --> 04:49.803
Uh~, OK.

04:54.393 --> 04:57.478
Then, humphing her nose
was sour Kangaroo.

04:57.478 --> 05:00.251
A type who's convince
she knows better than you

05:00.459 --> 05:03.474
She made every law
and then forced every rule

05:03.474 --> 05:06.663
as self conclaimed head
of the jungle of the Nool.

05:07.982 --> 05:09.754
Why can't I play with
the other kids, Mom?

05:09.754 --> 05:11.507
How many times have I told you?

05:11.507 --> 05:14.933
The jungle is no place
to act like a wild animal.

05:24.946 --> 05:27.298
My, that Horton certainly is eccentric?

05:27.298 --> 05:30.135
And that children are learning
so much from him.

05:30.135 --> 05:33.269
Learning to be a bunch a
hell brain half-wits.

05:33.427 --> 05:36.774
And that's why my Rudy
is pouch schooled.

05:36.774 --> 05:39.343
So, while Kangaroos
still there sneering a sneer

05:39.343 --> 05:41.224
Horton, how it's the best time of my life.

05:41.224 --> 05:42.986
What are you gonna show us then?

05:42.986 --> 05:46.923
Once again the speck floated
right by Horton's ear.

05:48.009 --> 05:49.045
And he heard it again.

05:49.045 --> 05:53.733
Just a very faint yelp,
as if some tiny person were calling for help.

05:56.874 --> 05:58.400
And you know what he thought?

05:58.400 --> 06:02.861
What he thought there must be someone
on top of that small speck of dust.

06:02.861 --> 06:05.218
Or even a famly.
It just might be so.

06:05.218 --> 06:08.385
A famliy with children just starting to grow.

06:10.798 --> 06:12.508
I wanna live!

06:14.505 --> 06:17.034
I got to go.
Katie, you're in charge.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.093
Wait!

06:22.514 --> 06:23.742
Come back!

06:46.276 --> 06:52.005
One more, one more,
One more, one more.

06:57.569 --> 06:59.923
- Ah here someone coming.
- Get here those.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.547
- Wait!
- Sound the alram!

07:07.089 --> 07:08.909
Excuse me!
On my stamp feet!

07:10.088 --> 07:11.318
Sorry, Wickershams.

07:11.318 --> 07:13.565
I promise I'm gonna
clean all this up later!

07:13.584 --> 07:15.487
Bring the arrow!

07:23.508 --> 07:25.576
I love the smell of
the banana's in the morning.

07:27.722 --> 07:29.207
Bananing Hou!

07:30.188 --> 07:32.897
Come on, guys! We're all mammals!

07:33.777 --> 07:34.894
Whou!

07:34.894 --> 07:38.330
I feel diplomatic process
is beginning to break down.

07:40.781 --> 07:41.424
There you are.

07:41.424 --> 07:43.287
I'll catch it. catch it.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.595
- Hi, kids.
- Wow!

08:01.995 --> 08:03.198
There

08:03.950 --> 08:05.460
Now you're safe.

08:06.541 --> 08:08.564
I know I heard you say something.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.515
I just know it.

08:11.676 --> 08:13.475
Where are you?

08:20.774 --> 08:23.110
- Horton?
- Uhoo, sorry.

08:24.052 --> 08:25.451
I just...ah.

08:25.451 --> 08:27.039
There was this speck.

08:27.039 --> 08:28.780
And the... they called up for help.

08:28.780 --> 08:29.986
- And I was...
- The speck...

08:29.986 --> 08:31.466
called out for help?

08:31.568 --> 08:33.342
Well not the speck. I mean

08:33.568 --> 08:35.347
That's ridiculous.

08:36.443 --> 08:37.443
Is what you thought I've been?

08:37.443 --> 08:40.650
No, the speck can't call out for help.
Come on.

08:40.881 --> 08:42.169
Get real!

08:43.320 --> 08:43.975
No.

08:43.975 --> 08:47.245
There's tiny person on that speck
and needs my help.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.038
Absurd.

08:49.115 --> 08:51.035
There aren't people that small.

08:51.035 --> 08:53.456
Whoa, maybe thay aren't small.

08:53.743 --> 08:54.806
Maybe...

08:55.037 --> 08:55.802
We're big.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.254
- Horton!
- No! Really, think about it.

08:57.254 --> 08:58.615
What if there is someone

08:58.615 --> 09:00.890
way out there,

09:01.119 --> 09:03.129
looking down on our world right now.

09:03.374 --> 09:05.584
And to them, we are the speck.

09:05.735 --> 09:07.523
And then this someone else come along,
he say,

09:07.523 --> 09:08.962
"Oh, there can't be people that small."

09:08.962 --> 09:09.889
And the first guy would say

09:09.889 --> 09:11.105
"Are you calling me a lier?"

09:11.105 --> 09:12.036
And the second guy would say

09:12.036 --> 09:13.801
"If the shoe fits wear it,

09:13.801 --> 09:15.085
and now that fits a blind."

09:15.085 --> 09:16.175
and the first guy pick supper break.

09:16.175 --> 09:18.855
And you might wanna zip up
the pouch for this next part.

09:18.855 --> 09:20.124
Alright, Fat boy!

09:20.124 --> 09:21.985
- You want some of there...
- Horton?

09:21.985 --> 09:24.463
There is nothing on that speck.

09:25.636 --> 09:26.555
But I heard.

09:26.555 --> 09:30.118
Did you?
Really? Oh my!

09:30.118 --> 09:33.269
Then how come I don't hear anything.

09:33.584 --> 09:35.395
Well?

09:35.854 --> 09:40.023
If you can't see, hear, or feel something

09:40.023 --> 09:41.581
it doesn't exist.

09:41.611 --> 09:47.339
I'm believing in tiny imaginary people
is just not something we do.

09:47.583 --> 09:51.112
Or tolerate here in the jungle of Nool.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.502
Really?

09:52.759 --> 09:54.151
Cause I verified I really tried

09:54.151 --> 09:55.035
I can find somebody

09:55.035 --> 09:56.945
- who believe what I'm saying.
- You will do nothing of the sort.

09:57.167 --> 10:00.118
You will not breathe the word of
this lie to anyone else.

10:00.118 --> 10:02.135
Expecially the children.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.436
I do not want you poisoning their minds
with this nonsense.

10:06.633 --> 10:08.949
Our community has standards, Horton.

10:09.183 --> 10:12.807
If you wanna remain a part of that
I recommand you follow them.

10:14.590 --> 10:17.086
Have a nice day.

10:19.826 --> 10:20.777
Alright then!

10:20.998 --> 10:23.021
I'll ah...take that an advisement.

10:23.021 --> 10:24.742
Certainly appreciate your input.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.287
I don't understand.

10:29.287 --> 10:30.699
I know I heard you.

10:30.699 --> 10:32.859
It was just clean as nose on my face.

10:33.787 --> 10:34.946
That's it.

10:35.371 --> 10:37.035
Maybe you can't hear me!

10:37.370 --> 10:40.011
Of course your ears must be tiny.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.962
I need to speak up!

10:43.755 --> 10:47.144
H-E-L-L-O-W!

10:47.144 --> 10:48.481
Now some people out there

10:48.481 --> 10:49.784
might think I know who

10:49.784 --> 10:52.756
they find they agreed
with that Sour Kangaroo

10:53.422 --> 10:56.610
"There can't really be people as small as a mice"

10:56.610 --> 10:58.884
Well there can.
And there are.

10:58.884 --> 11:01.575
Becuase Horton was right.

11:10.815 --> 11:13.278
Hellow!

11:15.918 --> 11:18.711
That single "Hellow" traveled all the way down

11:18.711 --> 11:22.809
to the speck, to the flowers,
to the fount of the small town.

11:23.301 --> 11:26.346
The town known as Whoville
for there live the Whos

11:26.346 --> 11:29.288
Really happy in safe,
knowing only good news,

11:29.585 --> 11:33.146
unaware that their world
was a speck on a clover,

11:33.146 --> 11:36.678
unaware the sweet life
they knew might be old

11:40.332 --> 11:43.359
The Mayor of Whoville
a man named McDodd

11:43.359 --> 11:47.034
who's devoted and faired
and little bit odd.

12:03.211 --> 12:06.477
The Mayor and his wife
they had children to spare.

12:06.695 --> 12:10.172
96 daughters, some here
and some there.

12:10.765 --> 12:14.857
96 girls to love,
96 girls to teach.

12:15.578 --> 12:18.906
But the Mayors have only few second for each.

12:19.525 --> 12:22.459
Daddy, I do better than best on my whostory test.

12:22.459 --> 12:24.525
Ah, whostory. I remembered well.

12:24.525 --> 12:25.813
That's one of my girls.

12:25.982 --> 12:27.848
Her is has been using my hairbrush?

12:27.848 --> 12:29.250
Her is has been using my hairbrush.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.515
Look, over there!

12:31.970 --> 12:33.205
There, all better.

12:33.508 --> 12:35.383
Can I please have whophone, daddy?

12:35.383 --> 12:37.338
Everyone else in my class has one.

12:37.338 --> 12:39.680
Oh, really? Everyone?

12:41.988 --> 12:45.737
- Aw! I will think about it.
- Daddy, look! Daddy look!

12:50.315 --> 12:51.241
Toos!

12:51.241 --> 12:53.759
It's "th" sweetheart.
It's "Tooth"

12:53.759 --> 12:56.370
In Whoville tradition unlike yours or mine

12:56.370 --> 12:58.607
Mayor's oldest is the next Mayor of line.

12:58.607 --> 13:01.339
And who was the oldest lead and stand tall?

13:01.339 --> 13:04.441
It was JoJo, his son,
the smallest who all.

13:04.441 --> 13:06.828
So, JoJo, what's what's shaking?

13:06.828 --> 13:09.734
What's happening?
What's the world?

13:10.234 --> 13:12.870
Now to you or to me, it's finally clear

13:12.870 --> 13:15.990
that JoJo did not want his father's career.

13:16.326 --> 13:19.592
But the Mayor pressed forward
completely illuded.

13:20.734 --> 13:24.137
And JoJo just sat there in silence and lude it.

13:27.388 --> 13:29.286
Oh, JoJo!

13:30.268 --> 13:32.879
- Hey! Why this he get more time?
- That's not fair!

13:33.358 --> 13:34.806
Son! Hey!

13:34.806 --> 13:36.228
And why didn't he speak?

13:36.228 --> 13:39.065
Well I think the leg was
frightened if he did,

13:39.065 --> 13:41.133
he might let down his dad.

13:41.133 --> 13:42.660
You know what's awesome?

13:43.199 --> 13:45.156
This is awesome!

13:45.156 --> 13:49.644
Just look at the men and the women
hanging on these walls.

13:49.644 --> 13:55.382
You, my boy, are part of family legacy
that spans centuries

13:55.656 --> 13:56.775
You know what?

13:57.057 --> 14:00.900
Your grandfather was Mayor of Whoville.

14:01.475 --> 14:05.697
And, your great grandmother, that's right.

14:05.956 --> 14:08.339
All the way down to your

14:09.898 --> 14:10.817
Great

14:10.817 --> 14:11.521
Great

14:11.521 --> 14:12.169
Great

14:12.169 --> 14:13.028
Great

14:13.028 --> 14:14.060
Not so great

14:14.060 --> 14:15.039
Great, Great

14:15.039 --> 14:16.357
Great, Great, Great

14:16.357 --> 14:17.657
Great, Great, Great

14:17.657 --> 14:19.294
Great~!

14:20.237 --> 14:22.012
Grandfather!

14:23.930 --> 14:26.569
Some day I hope to join them.

14:27.025 --> 14:28.608
Be one of the Grates.

14:28.926 --> 14:33.276
I tell you JoJo there is nothing like being Mayor.

14:33.276 --> 14:37.051
I get to sign resolutions,
approve ordinances, submit budgets.

14:37.051 --> 14:38.275
And in the edible parade

14:38.275 --> 14:41.360
I'm the one city noun top of the giant people.

14:43.445 --> 14:44.546
Some day

14:44.721 --> 14:47.082
That can be you too, JoJo.

14:47.563 --> 14:52.422
Some day you'll be the one
wearing the Mayor crest.

14:52.971 --> 14:53.957
You just...

14:54.163 --> 14:56.010
You just need to...

14:57.916 --> 14:59.291
You know what I mean?

15:00.661 --> 15:03.150
O.K. Good chat!

15:03.424 --> 15:07.205
I'm glad that we had this talk

15:08.026 --> 15:12.147
That I'm continuing now by myself.
Good.

15:17.926 --> 15:20.889
Oh! There. There are to become fit.

15:24.746 --> 15:29.395
Nothing wrong with this Morton.
Nothing wrong with this.

15:30.574 --> 15:31.959
Just you and me in the speck.

15:32.106 --> 15:33.707
Shouldn't a breeze.

15:34.186 --> 15:36.254
We're club. We're group.

15:36.567 --> 15:38.204
We can take a vote on issues.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.173
We can be a secret to society

15:40.173 --> 15:42.736
- to control pirate's power in the world.
- Horton?

15:42.736 --> 15:43.744
And no one else can join

15:43.744 --> 15:45.582
Unless they wear funny hats.

15:48.194 --> 15:49.662
Listen, Horton!

15:49.967 --> 15:51.883
The chair reconize it's brother Morton.

15:52.264 --> 15:55.905
I am really happy
you found this speck in all.

15:57.065 --> 16:00.545
But you might wanna
think about keeping it to yourself.

16:00.602 --> 16:02.282
Um, what, what?

16:03.577 --> 16:04.996
Are you talking to what clover.

16:04.996 --> 16:06.683
That doesn't look good.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.954
You know what doesn't look good?

16:11.475 --> 16:14.580
You, talking about the speck
like the speck isn't even there.

16:14.580 --> 16:16.742
Speck never said nothing bad about you.

16:17.324 --> 16:18.316
But hey!

16:18.586 --> 16:20.488
Good luck with your illusional superiority.

16:20.488 --> 16:24.547
You know the speck can think
anything you want about me you to speak.

16:24.547 --> 16:25.379
Wow!

16:25.703 --> 16:28.201
I see what's going on here.

16:28.675 --> 16:32.778
Morton, no matter how tight
this speck and I get,

16:32.778 --> 16:35.302
the speck could never replace you.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.174
I'm only sad that I would have to
explain that at this point.

16:38.857 --> 16:42.870
Well, that's awesome Horton.
That really helps.

16:42.990 --> 16:47.332
Just try to keep this to yourself.
I'll see you later.

16:47.698 --> 16:48.879
Try.

16:53.593 --> 16:55.571
Hey, Horton?
What's you got in there?

16:55.571 --> 16:56.885
What? Nothing.

16:57.534 --> 16:58.635
We're not doing anything.

17:01.832 --> 17:02.532
Who's we?

17:02.800 --> 17:04.290
We? What we?
Did I say that?

17:04.290 --> 17:06.058
I just... Oh, no.
I would never say that

17:06.058 --> 17:08.742
because that would a play that
I was with someone and not alone.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.470
O.K. There is a story
you can't talk to anybody

17:17.470 --> 17:18.115
I mean it.

17:18.115 --> 17:21.431
If anybody finds out about this,
it could be very very bad.

17:22.694 --> 17:24.060
I'm not sure why.

17:24.923 --> 17:26.209
We won't tell anyone.

17:26.496 --> 17:30.068
And if we do, we'll tell them
not to tell anyone.

17:30.459 --> 17:31.659
Perfect!

17:32.074 --> 17:32.520
O.K.

17:32.520 --> 17:33.532
I'm taking a bath, right.

17:33.532 --> 17:35.647
Cause my skin gets kind a dry.
My roof asht

17:35.647 --> 17:38.278
While Horton can clean about
the speck that he found

17:38.278 --> 17:40.571
How he'd save this what at really drowned.

17:40.571 --> 17:42.502
The Mayor set off
on his morning commute

17:42.502 --> 17:45.093
and noticed things
not quite the same on his route.

17:45.686 --> 17:47.818
But please don't blame Horton
for he didn't know

17:48.204 --> 17:49.996
That a swamp pump a bub

17:49.996 --> 17:52.455
I do it in the water like this

17:53.587 --> 17:55.750
Was a big bub flew.

17:57.237 --> 17:59.068
Hey, Joe! Don't work too hard!

17:59.068 --> 18:02.140
Ah! These luxery condos
they have gone themselves.

18:05.862 --> 18:08.923
Hey, you look at that.
I guess they do build themselves.

18:09.002 --> 18:11.962
Oh~Kei, that happened.

18:14.847 --> 18:16.361
Now the Mayor knew it was his job

18:16.361 --> 18:19.616
to convey the unusual things
that he noticed that day.

18:19.965 --> 18:21.341
There was one problem.

18:21.595 --> 18:23.385
Though his will was strong

18:23.599 --> 18:25.300
- You are late.
- Thank you Miss. Yelp.

18:25.660 --> 18:28.736
Nothing in Whoville had ever gone wrong.

18:28.736 --> 18:32.210
We have all happy be
with all the we've got.

18:32.210 --> 18:35.689
We like it in here Whoville.
We like it a lot.

18:36.315 --> 18:40.656
We're all very busy with
Who-Centennial's coming up. So,..

18:40.854 --> 18:43.089
Let's break this meeting to order.

18:43.269 --> 18:47.091
Mr. Mayor I presume you have
some good news for us.

18:47.559 --> 18:50.668
Well, it's news. I don't know.

18:50.668 --> 18:53.821
If we need to go label it good or bad
anything like that

18:54.018 --> 18:58.965
The thing is I have noticed
some odd goings on in Whoville lately

18:58.965 --> 19:01.050
Good on goings on?

19:01.050 --> 19:04.874
Well, you know.
Tremors, clouds surly in the sky.

19:04.874 --> 19:08.283
And it seems to me just be safe,
we might wanna consider...

19:08.283 --> 19:09.377
Pospo nin th WhoCentenia?

19:09.377 --> 19:11.041
Consider what?

19:11.483 --> 19:13.368
Pospo nin th WhoCentenia?

19:14.208 --> 19:16.311
What?!
Speak up, man!

19:17.056 --> 19:20.102
Postponing the Who-centennial, alright?

19:39.981 --> 19:44.574
We're about to celebrate 100 years
of Whoville happiness in  harmony.

19:44.655 --> 19:46.919
And you want to postpone the celebration?

19:46.919 --> 19:48.721
Well, what if Whoville's not safe.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.287
Nothing ever goes wrong in Whoville!

19:51.405 --> 19:54.043
Never has and never will!

19:54.169 --> 19:56.279
You bloodly boob!

19:56.279 --> 19:57.858
Boob.

20:00.940 --> 20:04.212
The Who-centennial will proceed as planned!

20:04.649 --> 20:07.394
The Mayor was really being an idiot.

20:07.394 --> 20:10.890
It will be all smile from now on.

20:16.315 --> 20:18.960
Girl, I got 15,000 friends already.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.235
What? What you mean it don't look like me?

20:21.235 --> 20:22.653
That look just like me.

20:23.043 --> 20:25.643
Ten years ago...
Wait a minute, hold on for a second.

20:29.664 --> 20:30.917
Treats me like an idiot?

20:30.917 --> 20:32.813
I'm not an idiot.

20:34.951 --> 20:36.464
Do I look like an idiot?

20:37.802 --> 20:40.474
- You don't want me to answer that.
- I'm not an idiot.

20:41.815 --> 20:43.729
That's nerve call me a boob?

20:43.729 --> 20:45.198
I would never call somebody a boob.

20:45.268 --> 20:46.203
He is a boob.

20:46.463 --> 20:49.229
Look at you, Yak.

20:49.525 --> 20:51.184
Look at your face.

20:51.474 --> 20:52.171
And I bet.

20:52.171 --> 20:54.944
You don't look so good with this
staple on your head!

21:04.936 --> 21:05.635
Wow!

21:06.040 --> 21:07.177
Wa-ha-au!

21:10.223 --> 21:12.184
- Thank you, Miss. Yelp.
- You're welcome.

21:13.058 --> 21:14.031
Oh!

21:14.754 --> 21:15.734
Hellow?

21:15.900 --> 21:18.318
Who's you that?
I'll go out punch you.

21:28.443 --> 21:29.557
Hellow?

21:32.580 --> 21:34.526
Hellow?

21:40.852 --> 21:41.889
Who's there?

21:42.173 --> 21:44.066
I'm... This the Mayor.

21:44.334 --> 21:45.311
The Mayor?

21:45.517 --> 21:46.697
The Mayor?

21:47.249 --> 21:48.796
Uh, look at this Mayor!

21:50.799 --> 21:51.576
I knew it.

21:51.576 --> 21:53.276
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.

21:53.276 --> 21:54.533
There's life on this speck.

21:54.533 --> 21:56.714
The speck?
What speck?

21:57.078 --> 21:58.843
Well, Am...

21:59.342 --> 22:01.469
I don't exactly know
how to tell you this. But...

22:02.104 --> 22:04.475
You're living on a speck.

22:04.557 --> 22:07.203
Well, I ee hate to disagree with you.

22:07.203 --> 22:09.100
Oh, voice from the drain pipe.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.335
But, I live in Whoville.

22:11.335 --> 22:13.035
Well, then the Whoville is a speck.

22:13.558 --> 22:17.730
Right. O.K. Seriously.
Who is this?

22:17.960 --> 22:19.879
Is this Bert from accounting?

22:20.299 --> 22:22.175
No. This is Horton.

22:22.229 --> 22:23.306
I'm an elephant.

22:23.306 --> 22:27.612
O.K. Horton, fake name.

22:27.612 --> 22:28.893
Where are you?

22:28.893 --> 22:31.189
Well, from where you standing?

22:31.189 --> 22:32.439
I guess I'm...

22:32.998 --> 22:34.454
in the sky.

22:34.716 --> 22:35.954
Compare to you I'm enormous

22:35.954 --> 22:39.625
which is saying something
because I slim down quite a bit I swim.

22:40.335 --> 22:44.495
Your whole world fits on
a flower in my world.

22:44.558 --> 22:47.479
Oh, man, this is even inclusion for you Bert.

22:47.479 --> 22:48.733
Don't believe me?

22:48.869 --> 22:50.760
Watch what happen
when I put you in the shade

22:50.760 --> 22:53.546
- This is absolutly impossi...
- Dark.

22:54.932 --> 22:55.645
Light.

22:56.465 --> 22:57.003
Dark.

22:58.075 --> 22:58.678
Light.

22:58.678 --> 23:01.861
- Dark, light, dark, light....Dark!
- Wow!

23:02.417 --> 23:04.500
- Light!
- Uooo

23:04.500 --> 23:05.961
Don't you see?

23:06.184 --> 23:10.058
We're in the middle of some kind of
amazing cosmic convergence.

23:10.576 --> 23:12.496
Two vastly different worlds.

23:12.675 --> 23:14.620
Miraculously crossing path!

23:14.864 --> 23:16.275
Mine colossal!

23:16.330 --> 23:17.349
Yours mini to cure.

23:17.349 --> 23:20.147
Yet, somehow we've marriage to make contact.

23:20.343 --> 23:23.408
If you think about it,
it's pretty amazing.

23:26.607 --> 23:28.154
Is everything O.K. down there?

23:28.794 --> 23:31.319
Oh. I.. I don't know.

23:31.319 --> 23:32.695
You tell me...

23:32.947 --> 23:34.588
You're the one who hold the speck.

23:35.169 --> 23:37.022
I'm the one who's holding the speck.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.428
I'm not holding the speck.

23:39.748 --> 23:41.339
Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor.

23:41.969 --> 23:43.229
Am

23:43.759 --> 23:45.009
Hold, please.

23:47.178 --> 23:48.609
What at all this means?

23:48.609 --> 23:50.182
The Mayor haven't the clue.

23:50.182 --> 23:52.580
So he went to the office of Dr. Larue.

23:52.771 --> 23:55.434
Brainest brain on the staff at Who use.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.705
Dr. Larue!

23:57.835 --> 24:00.675
Oh, this is crazy.

24:00.675 --> 24:02.056
Oh, Mr. Mayor.

24:02.997 --> 24:04.482
Ah, how may I be a assitance?

24:04.680 --> 24:06.074
I don't know. Hey.

24:06.074 --> 24:07.000
You know I just wondering

24:07.189 --> 24:09.980
If our world will stay tiny speck

24:10.350 --> 24:11.680
floating to space,

24:11.955 --> 24:12.990
how would we know?

24:12.990 --> 24:14.695
Oh, why would you ask something like that?

24:14.695 --> 24:16.915
Oh, no reason, no reason at all.

24:16.915 --> 24:18.717
I don't even remember.
Yes I do.

24:18.717 --> 24:19.997
That you know what,

24:19.997 --> 24:21.892
some guy was talking to me

24:21.892 --> 24:24.339
not an elephant in the sky,
a guy on the ground

24:24.628 --> 24:26.754
Ah, there would be several ramifications

24:26.975 --> 24:28.595
Good ramifications?

24:29.645 --> 24:31.150
A tiny speck.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.300
Uh-huh, yeah, tiny speck.

24:33.677 --> 24:35.378
Floating around...

24:36.206 --> 24:38.644
Well, we'd have inexplicable tremors.

24:39.462 --> 24:41.546
Dramatic changes in the weather.

24:42.162 --> 24:45.835
And if we didn't eventually achieve
some sort of stability

24:45.835 --> 24:49.525
our world would be destroyed

24:49.835 --> 24:50.901
Destroyed!

24:50.901 --> 24:54.875
Destroyed, oh destroyed.
No somehow.

24:58.537 --> 24:59.242
Horton?

24:59.499 --> 25:05.270
Ah, no. This is Danny.
Horton is busy right now.

25:05.786 --> 25:09.236
You, I'm joking. That's me.

25:09.562 --> 25:10.725
Ah, We're doomed.

25:10.861 --> 25:12.321
Listen! Horton!

25:12.568 --> 25:14.643
Turns out I need your help a little bit.

25:14.865 --> 25:17.258
Apparently if that speck
keeps moving around,

25:17.258 --> 25:19.704
our whole world
could be obliterated.

25:19.943 --> 25:21.144
Ah-uh So,

25:21.204 --> 25:26.571
I need you to find us Who's
safer more stable home and fast

25:26.902 --> 25:28.328
No problem, Mr. Mayor.

25:28.617 --> 25:29.395
Let's see...

25:31.732 --> 25:32.627
Wow!

25:32.996 --> 25:34.450
That's a nice view.

25:37.363 --> 25:38.805
Hellow, is everything O.K.?

25:48.395 --> 25:49.710
What's going on up there?

26:03.162 --> 26:06.816
This entire jungle is a house of death!

26:07.326 --> 26:08.194
Oh, wait.

26:08.470 --> 26:09.452
There's good spot.

26:09.865 --> 26:13.003
And it's then Horton saw
at the top of mountain Nool

26:13.003 --> 26:16.195
a small cave that will peaceful and quiet and cool

26:16.195 --> 26:19.341
where sun flower grew
proud and tall from the ground.

26:19.341 --> 26:22.037
There he knew every Who would be safe,

26:22.244 --> 26:23.207
would be sound.

26:23.395 --> 26:25.001
I found it Mayor.

26:25.237 --> 26:27.067
The perfect place.

26:27.545 --> 26:28.767
Right up there.

26:29.327 --> 26:31.580
- On the top of the mountain Nool
- Mr. Mayor?

26:31.580 --> 26:33.166
- Yeah?
- I wish we could...

26:33.295 --> 26:36.389
Oh-ho, Ah, Shiny. Ah-ha.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.930
The Who-centennial Committee is waiting for you

26:39.930 --> 26:42.463
to look over the giantly bar
for the edible parade.

26:42.733 --> 26:45.661
Oh, and then you will do at the dinners
for your Whowill Canal.

26:45.661 --> 26:49.543
You know, sticking Who in front of everything
doesn't make it hard last.

26:49.724 --> 26:50.917
Just waste time!

26:51.660 --> 26:53.493
I don't wanna go.

26:55.372 --> 26:56.544
Listen, Horton. I got to go.

26:56.544 --> 26:58.866
Apparently there's problem with the giant people.

26:58.866 --> 27:01.558
You just take care that meatball, Sir.

27:01.813 --> 27:04.137
And leave the freaking out to me.

27:04.275 --> 27:06.981
So, then Horton began his long paraless track

27:07.219 --> 27:09.984
determine to save the small world on the speck.

27:11.265 --> 27:13.737
Horton was faithful and soul working kind.

27:13.860 --> 27:15.055
I got ya.

27:15.417 --> 27:16.725
He was a brave hero.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.155
I'll protect ya.

27:18.396 --> 27:19.654
At least in his mind.

27:19.852 --> 27:22.157
We must become invisible.
Travel silently.

27:22.325 --> 27:24.805
For there're forces.
They would seek to destroy us.

27:25.268 --> 27:28.654
Hee-Ha-Ah-aaaaa-Ah!

27:30.568 --> 27:31.155
Ah-A?!

27:31.275 --> 27:33.682
So, you think you can stick upon me, Huh!

27:33.919 --> 27:35.647
E-Yab! Ah-Dadada!

27:35.735 --> 27:38.684
It's clear that you're match for my ticky kei!

27:39.115 --> 27:40.587
Uh-uh. He-e.

27:41.531 --> 27:43.561
I see you matered the way of snaping branch.

27:43.768 --> 27:44.884
Watch me tumble!

27:47.245 --> 27:48.407
Horton! Let's go!

27:48.407 --> 27:51.557
You have asshole.
Mother Kangaroo has monkeys.

27:51.557 --> 27:52.878
I wll make monkeys of these monkeys.

29:20.563 --> 29:22.741

29:25.210 --> 29:27.946

And elephants never forget.

29:28.020 --> 29:29.283
It's a curse, really.

29:29.283 --> 29:30.421

29:42.407 --> 29:43.482

29:46.892 --> 29:48.075

29:49.256 --> 29:50.075
Ya.

29:50.425 --> 29:53.661
Are you sure you wanna
fight this fight, Horton?

29:53.661 --> 29:58.135
Becuase I promise you will
get very ugly very fast.

29:58.135 --> 30:00.333
And you need to ask yourself.

30:00.606 --> 30:03.636

30:03.877 --> 30:05.588
For a clover?

30:05.975 --> 30:07.494

30:07.800 --> 30:09.070

So, hand it over.

30:14.162 --> 30:16.407
No! I can't give it to you.

30:17.114 --> 30:18.676
There're people on this speck.

30:18.707 --> 30:20.509
Granted very small people.

30:20.589 --> 30:21.986
But a person's person.

30:21.996 --> 30:23.701
No matter how small.

30:28.022 --> 30:30.119
You just crossed the line, Horton.

30:30.327 --> 30:32.611
And I'm gonna make you pay.

30:38.588 --> 30:40.240
That Horton is threat us.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.899

31:09.950 --> 31:10.833

31:11.121 --> 31:12.299
No need to worry.

32:52.724 --> 32:53.904

35:43.129 --> 35:43.770

35:49.219 --> 35:52.156
Well, I no detective, Nedd.
But you are hanging from the chandelier.

35:52.156 --> 35:53.440
I just thought it might look better

35:53.440 --> 35:56.528
somewhere it can't fall on us
and crashes our sleep.

35:59.208 --> 36:00.764
What is going on?

36:03.931 --> 36:05.819
Hey, Honey.

36:08.006 --> 36:12.108
Did you ever get the feeling
that you're being watched?

36:12.162 --> 36:15.108
Am... Ya, sure.

36:15.580 --> 36:16.466
I suppose.

36:16.466 --> 36:21.616
And then you get feeling that
maybe that thing watching you is...Ah...

36:22.134 --> 36:23.199
A giant elephant?

36:23.883 --> 36:25.322

You know, how you can that weired feeling
that your world actually a tiny speck?

36:30.275 --> 36:34.327
And then the elephant
that I talked about earlier

36:34.428 --> 36:36.305
he's carrying it around on flower.

36:36.305 --> 36:40.492
And you realize then if you tell anybody
they think you're crazy.

36:40.492 --> 36:45.280
But you still feel the responsibility
to keep everyone safe.

36:45.616 --> 36:46.847
You know that feeling?

36:47.036 --> 36:48.095
Am...

36:48.378 --> 36:50.098
You know, I'm gonna have to say no.

36:51.084 --> 36:53.236
Do you know that feeling?

36:56.212 --> 36:57.463

37:07.039 --> 37:11.361
And if your seeing elephants
and flowers, then fine.

37:11.459 --> 37:13.876
Just don't tell anyone else that story.

37:13.876 --> 37:15.649
O.K.? And remember.

37:15.649 --> 37:17.238
It's not the end of the world.

37:19.665 --> 37:21.080
The end of the world?

37:22.574 --> 37:25.756

37:47.030 --> 37:48.528
This is your elephant speaking.

37:48.686 --> 37:52.503
Just sit back and enjoy the ride
and we all are happy to the mountain Nool in..

37:52.503 --> 37:54.349
No, you can't have ice cream.
Go back there.

37:55.228 --> 37:56.220
Who's there?

37:56.569 --> 38:00.475

and one son.

38:08.076 --> 38:09.542
Hohohoho~, busy guy.

38:09.954 --> 38:12.654
Then we all share one bathroom.

Nedd? What are you up to now?

38:27.977 --> 38:29.706
I was just about put the kids bed,

39:12.448 --> 39:17.244
Yeah. I've realize that we have
not been seeing eye to eye lately

39:17.244 --> 39:20.096
and most of it is my fault.
It's true.

39:20.096 --> 39:21.663
You know what I've been trying to do?

39:21.663 --> 39:25.924
I have been trying to impose
my vision of your future on you.

39:26.516 --> 39:28.245
What me make this perfectly clear

39:28.717 --> 39:33.374

Hands on, strong and silent,

40:01.579 --> 40:07.712
Then, JoJo snuck out feeling lonely and sad
and tragedy of misunderstood by his dad.

40:23.415 --> 40:25.555
And where was he going
in such a lay down?

40:28.594 --> 40:32.153
Up to Whoville's abandoned star study tower.

40:33.046 --> 40:35.874
A place with boy felt contented free.

40:36.144 --> 40:38.680
A place he could be what wanted to be.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.104
And what was inside there
I'd say if I could.

40:44.104 --> 40:47.897
But above of the Kangaroo was up to no good.

40:55.332 --> 40:56.420
Can I come out now, Mom?

40:56.420 --> 40:58.589
No, Rudy. Stay in the room.

40:58.589 --> 41:00.934
- But, Mom?
- Stay inside.

41:11.748 --> 41:13.886
Mr. Vlad-I-Koff?

41:25.835 --> 41:27.595
Eating, go.

41:27.595 --> 41:29.440

41:29.440 --> 41:31.725
But I need your help.

41:31.876 --> 41:32.997
It's Horton.

41:33.265 --> 41:35.820
He's become obsess with a colver

41:35.823 --> 41:39.357
And he get actually thinks
there are little people on it.

41:41.679 --> 41:43.583
I want that colver destroyed.

41:43.692 --> 41:45.676
Sure, what a big deal this is.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.048
For you, bro.

41:48.143 --> 41:50.842
I'd do it myself.
But being a lady

41:50.842 --> 41:53.162
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.

41:53.661 --> 41:56.308
But I hear you have no problem with there.

41:57.732 --> 41:58.522

But...

42:03.481 --> 42:05.694
I will only do this for a price.

42:05.835 --> 42:08.568
In exchange for a friend who pay up...

42:09.224 --> 42:10.210
No.

42:11.078 --> 42:12.515
- This
- Yes.

42:12.743 --> 42:14.867
- little kangaroo.
- Mom?!

42:15.007 --> 42:15.954
Quiet, Rudy.

42:16.055 --> 42:17.929
Momy is thinking it over.

42:19.938 --> 42:22.478
We'll thanks but, on second thought

42:22.478 --> 42:26.910
I think I'm going to have the Wickersham Brothers
take care of this for me.

42:26.910 --> 42:29.994
Yeah, of course, Wickersham
I mean they're quasy operation.

42:29.994 --> 42:31.334
You know, they'd... Wait! No!

42:31.334 --> 42:32.874
You can't go over Wickersham.

42:32.874 --> 42:36.786
No No. No no no.
Wickershams would be perfect for this job.

42:36.949 --> 42:40.365
But, they are monkeys.
He's not scary.

42:40.365 --> 42:44.175
Ah, thanks anyway.
Maybe next time.

42:44.175 --> 42:45.039
Wait!

42:45.785 --> 42:48.528
Here is what I will do
the precious clover.

42:48.758 --> 42:49.990
I will take it.

42:50.262 --> 42:51.347
I will crush it.

42:51.737 --> 42:54.990
And I will devour it.

43:01.691 --> 43:03.932
Bigger than it looked. One second.

43:06.307 --> 43:07.557
Oly moly.

43:13.275 --> 43:14.759
Then I will regurgitate it.

43:14.804 --> 43:15.687
Then...

43:15.994 --> 43:18.621
I mean I devour it second time.

43:18.875 --> 43:20.797
So two times devour.

43:21.302 --> 43:22.795
Sounds nice.

43:23.407 --> 43:25.548
But I think I'll talk to the Wickershams.

43:25.710 --> 43:26.403
Wait.

43:27.805 --> 43:29.336
Here is best part.

43:29.718 --> 43:31.523
I do all

43:32.372 --> 43:34.055
Gracious.

43:34.646 --> 43:36.221
That's free bro.

43:37.177 --> 43:38.225
What do you think?

43:41.684 --> 43:45.106
- Deal.
- Yes. Score. Thanking you.

43:45.324 --> 43:46.505
You won't regret.

44:20.972 --> 44:21.775
Mayor?

44:22.406 --> 44:23.355
Mayor?

44:23.814 --> 44:25.556
Open up, Mr. Mayor!

44:25.910 --> 44:27.121
Mr. Mayor!

44:28.246 --> 44:31.210
It's snowing in the summer!

44:35.951 --> 44:36.755
Yes.

44:37.017 --> 44:38.167
Yes, it is.

44:38.167 --> 44:40.178
It's a dramatic change in the weather.

44:40.178 --> 44:42.835
As if we're on a speck floating to space.

44:42.835 --> 44:46.274
I don't know how you knew.
But, somehow you did.

44:46.422 --> 44:51.576
And Whoville is headed for disaster.

44:51.784 --> 44:54.228
- Oh, Horton.
- What?

44:54.482 --> 44:56.463
Ah, nothing. I'm on it.

44:56.463 --> 44:59.122
It's up to us to save the people of Whoville.

45:03.277 --> 45:04.761
Snow is not lucky.

45:06.846 --> 45:07.757
That's not... Stop.

45:09.743 --> 45:11.479
O.K. Anybody else?

45:12.078 --> 45:12.748
Good.

45:14.743 --> 45:16.916
No no. Don't join it.
This is not fun.

45:16.916 --> 45:18.450
Uh, this is sign of doomed.

45:20.612 --> 45:23.263
Oh, sweety, that's.
No. No no no.

45:23.263 --> 45:24.425
They took. they took.

45:26.728 --> 45:29.455
Stop having fun immediately!

45:29.455 --> 45:30.703
This is dangerous.

45:31.441 --> 45:32.035
O.K.

45:42.803 --> 45:43.468
Horton?

45:43.618 --> 45:44.731
Uh? What?

45:51.927 --> 45:53.083
Hey, there.

45:54.155 --> 45:55.373
We're in big trouble down here.

45:55.373 --> 45:58.204
It's happening.
It's snowing in the middle of summer.

45:58.204 --> 45:59.494
It's end of the world!

46:03.114 --> 46:03.852
Hold on here.

46:03.991 --> 46:05.889
I think I know what your problem is.

46:16.887 --> 46:18.395
There, get better?

46:20.747 --> 46:22.627
That seems you have worked.

46:23.267 --> 46:25.690
Eh-uh. Do I smell peanuts?

46:25.690 --> 46:27.725
Yes, they are my favorite snack.

46:28.006 --> 46:29.364
But they tender linger.

46:33.292 --> 46:36.023
Ohho! K-Uh. Debrick, No.

46:36.586 --> 46:38.506
Oh-O. Hang on Mr. Mayor.

46:38.805 --> 46:39.861
I may have to put up a flight.

46:40.106 --> 46:42.095
Frightened elephant can be very dangerous.

46:42.638 --> 46:43.399
Alright!

46:43.399 --> 46:46.115
You come down the under, buddy.

46:46.231 --> 46:47.821
You hungry for trouble?

46:47.821 --> 46:49.555
I don't know how you can easy self by.

46:49.555 --> 46:50.714
Take a fight.

46:53.817 --> 46:55.000
I hate running.

46:55.201 --> 46:56.063
Morton!

46:56.643 --> 46:59.920
- Don't do that!
- Horton!

47:01.419 --> 47:03.551
Horton? Don't...
There you are.

47:03.551 --> 47:06.013
We got trouble. Wait. Stay. Wait.
Can you hear that?

47:06.136 --> 47:07.873
No I'm here. O.K. Listen.
No, go.

47:07.873 --> 47:11.172
Kangaroo has gone nuts, bananas.

47:11.172 --> 47:14.061
She's telling everyone that
you should be kicked out of Nool.

47:14.061 --> 47:15.086
She said that?

47:15.298 --> 47:16.613
I thought we're friends.

47:16.613 --> 47:18.597
Where is she'e gone to Vlad's.

47:18.847 --> 47:22.057
Vlad. Vlad.
I know two Vlads.

47:22.057 --> 47:25.749
Is it the bad Vlad or the bunny Vlad
that makes the Cookies?

47:25.973 --> 47:29.373
Yeah, Horton.
She's sending you a bunny with cookies.

47:29.373 --> 47:32.246
I think we can assume it's not bad Vlad.

47:32.526 --> 47:33.715
Yeah, that's good call.

47:33.715 --> 47:38.827
So, unless you're cool
with giant razor sharp claws,

47:38.827 --> 47:40.616
There be not fights up your body,

47:40.882 --> 47:42.607
If I give her the clover.

47:42.607 --> 47:43.689
I can't.

47:43.981 --> 47:45.485
I promised the Mayor.

47:45.863 --> 47:48.063
I meant what I said.
I said what what I meant.

47:48.063 --> 47:50.914
And an elephant's faiths were 100%.

47:50.914 --> 47:56.065
Please, for me, just this once,
be faithful 99% of the time.

47:56.065 --> 47:58.050
I've never gone 99% on anything.

47:58.050 --> 48:00.123
I think I'm awesome.
So come on.

48:00.123 --> 48:04.021
I meant to what I said
and I said what I meant.

48:04.437 --> 48:05.456
I'm gonna say it.

48:06.576 --> 48:08.385
You can that all days it's not happen then.

48:09.994 --> 48:12.082
- An elephant's faithful 100%.
- That's right.

48:12.082 --> 48:14.469
That's my code. My motto.

48:14.949 --> 48:16.020
But thanks for the worning.

48:16.196 --> 48:18.079
Motto. O.K.

48:18.428 --> 48:23.482
But watch the skies.
Keep watching the skies.

48:27.647 --> 48:30.864
Mayor, you need to get
everyone on the ground, now.

48:31.100 --> 48:33.212
- Two, Three, four...
- I wanna sound the alarm.

48:33.637 --> 48:37.408
There's a good possibility we maybe attacked
by a giant cannibalous bird.

48:37.408 --> 48:38.275
Waht?

48:38.275 --> 48:40.674
There's small chance
it could be bunny with cookies.

48:40.674 --> 48:42.045
But, I wouldn't count on it.

48:42.987 --> 48:45.789
- Oh, they are formidable words.
- Ya

48:46.005 --> 48:46.750
Are you there?

48:47.565 --> 48:50.437
Ya, no. That's a great idea.
It just...

48:50.437 --> 48:54.624
in order to get everyone mobilized
I need the O.K. of the city council.

48:54.624 --> 48:57.230
And they never listen to me.

48:57.230 --> 49:00.315
I've been called boob.
Several times.

49:00.315 --> 49:02.614
- I can't do it.
- You have to talk to them, Mayor.

49:02.614 --> 49:04.056
O.K. Listen.

49:06.275 --> 49:07.046
Bad Vlad.

49:07.830 --> 49:08.721
Bad Vlad.

49:09.813 --> 49:11.081
Bad Vlad!

49:17.954 --> 49:19.986
That is definitely not a bunny.

49:27.707 --> 49:28.523
Lost him.

49:29.082 --> 49:31.156
Mean to lose him.
And I lost him.

49:36.961 --> 49:38.703
This tree for real, come on!

49:38.703 --> 49:41.550
Hang on, Whoville!
This is gonna get rough!

49:52.259 --> 49:54.362
Now you're going to dead-end.

49:55.526 --> 49:57.116
Get ready for the best.

49:59.823 --> 50:00.971
Leave me alone!

50:05.119 --> 50:07.508
No! Hold on!

50:18.787 --> 50:20.575
I just know he's gonna
jump out somewhere.

50:20.575 --> 50:21.926
- Hello?
- Ah-Ak!!

50:41.329 --> 50:42.972
Chess mate.

50:43.437 --> 50:45.947
Now it's time for me to take clover

50:45.947 --> 50:48.732
and crush all the little people on a two sang...

50:48.732 --> 50:51.533
Sorry.
This is where we get off.

50:54.610 --> 50:57.169
Ah, right in the beak!

50:57.928 --> 51:00.224
Ah. Cool line.

51:00.224 --> 51:02.067
Usually I can I think
those things to later.

51:02.489 --> 51:03.929
- Mayor?
-  Ah, Horton.

51:04.455 --> 51:05.531
Are you O.K.?

51:06.530 --> 51:07.158
Ah.

51:11.480 --> 51:13.009
Well, more or less.

51:13.269 --> 51:16.315
- What happened? The bird?
- Ya, it attacked me.

51:16.504 --> 51:18.963
Mayor, your people are in danger.

51:20.245 --> 51:21.969
You know what, I'm gonna do it.

51:21.969 --> 51:25.304
I'm going to go out there.
And tell them what is going on.

51:25.304 --> 51:27.968
Perfect.
Now quick. Get go on.

51:33.125 --> 51:35.037
Hey, Mr. Mayor! Something's wrong!

51:35.037 --> 51:36.562
My basement is in the attic.

51:36.562 --> 51:38.330
The science museum is history.

51:38.330 --> 51:41.490
- We're lost thousand in this messy.
- What's going on Mr. Mayor?

51:42.028 --> 51:44.318
I'm declaring a state of emergency.

51:44.318 --> 51:47.438
Don't worry. Don't worry.

51:47.438 --> 51:50.013
The Mayor is just being a moron.

51:50.430 --> 51:53.308
No wait.
Whoville is in terrible danger.

51:53.308 --> 51:57.049
Everyone needs get down to the
underground storage area immediately.

51:57.049 --> 52:01.893
Time time.
Let's do this democratically.

52:02.161 --> 52:07.105
Who wants the joy and glory
and festivity of the Who-centennial

52:07.105 --> 52:09.127
to proceed as planned?

52:09.658 --> 52:11.754
- Yeah!!!
- Yeah!!!

52:12.004 --> 52:14.738
And who, like the Mayor,

52:14.738 --> 52:18.840
thinks it would be better
to spend the Who-centennial

52:18.840 --> 52:22.440
in an underground storage area?

52:22.603 --> 52:24.468
Yeah!!!

52:25.529 --> 52:27.602
Wait! You got to listen to me.

52:27.602 --> 52:30.635
Our whole world could explode.

52:34.756 --> 52:36.924
Much more quickly.

52:37.201 --> 52:38.907
And our world wouldn't be that noise.

52:41.203 --> 52:44.325
The people have spoken Mr. Mayor.

52:44.596 --> 52:46.533
You're finished.

52:46.707 --> 52:50.396
No one believes you.
No one supports you.

52:51.985 --> 52:55.565
- Horton believes me.
- Horton?

52:56.662 --> 52:58.679
Who's Horton?

52:58.679 --> 53:04.356
Horton is a giant elephant in the sky.

53:04.964 --> 53:06.237
Don't bother look. He is invisible.

53:06.237 --> 53:08.726
And he is the one risking his life

53:08.726 --> 53:11.167
to get Whoville which by the way

53:11.167 --> 53:14.606
is a speck on a clover just safety.

53:25.532 --> 53:26.639
I can prove it.

53:26.903 --> 53:29.947
Horton's voice comes out of this horn.

53:34.056 --> 53:35.739
Horton!

53:36.399 --> 53:39.410
I have all the Whos gathered in town square.

53:39.664 --> 53:41.916
Let them know you there.

53:42.270 --> 53:43.013
Gee.

53:43.623 --> 53:46.213
It's a kind of high pressure situation then.

53:48.707 --> 53:51.107
Wow. I'm really run a blank here.

53:51.384 --> 53:52.638
I know.

53:56.669 --> 53:57.738
Horton?

53:58.530 --> 53:59.950
Horton, We're waiting.

54:01.010 --> 54:04.187
Time to show everyone
that you exist and...

54:04.359 --> 54:07.755
By extension what a none boob I am.

54:14.264 --> 54:15.085
Wait!

54:15.469 --> 54:20.469
Everyone look at the wind.
What do you think that means?

54:21.120 --> 54:25.244
It means, Um, it means...
obviously, uh...

54:25.931 --> 54:29.413
Let's the Kite Flying Race begins!

54:46.030 --> 54:49.929
What a perron on you Horton! Ha Ha Ha!

55:42.907 --> 55:44.710
Woo, brain freeze!

55:51.425 --> 55:53.400
Give Me Back

55:53.400 --> 55:57.065
- My Speck!
- Not this time, guy.

56:03.783 --> 56:06.186
I'm so sorry that I let you down, but...

56:06.334 --> 56:08.893
this... this is bigger than me.

56:08.974 --> 56:11.862
Get the famliy together
and get some where safe.

56:12.782 --> 56:13.781
I will!

56:14.634 --> 56:15.542
I believe you.

56:21.117 --> 56:23.777
I've got you now, innocent.

56:25.234 --> 56:26.804
No No No!

56:38.164 --> 56:39.142
Oh, no.

56:42.094 --> 56:43.283
Huk! Eung.

56:45.784 --> 56:49.514
Yeah!! Hahahahaha...

56:49.798 --> 56:53.116
AhHahahaha....

57:05.851 --> 57:06.607
Mayor?

57:07.630 --> 57:08.606
Anybody there?

57:12.462 --> 57:13.665
Anyone?

57:14.470 --> 57:17.338
But clover by clover by clover he found

57:17.338 --> 57:21.119
But the one that he sought for
was just not around.

57:21.810 --> 57:22.725
Mayor?

57:25.281 --> 57:26.181
Hellow?

57:26.181 --> 57:29.630
And by noon poor Horton
more dead and alive,

57:29.630 --> 57:34.079
Had picked, searched,
and filed up 9005.

57:34.761 --> 57:35.827
Hellow.

57:36.692 --> 57:38.097
Sorry to bother you.

57:38.745 --> 57:39.853
Nobody.

57:43.308 --> 57:44.501
Knock knock.

57:46.308 --> 57:47.915
This is the way you take.

57:48.211 --> 57:49.394
Whos there?

57:49.623 --> 57:53.007
If there were any Whos there,

57:54.189 --> 57:57.435
You get it! Whos there.

57:57.879 --> 58:00.258
I can't give up have them with you.

58:00.620 --> 58:04.298
All day he looked.
Looked on and on.

58:05.056 --> 58:07.689
Till his hope was almost gone.

58:08.157 --> 58:11.115
No. No. No. Please No!

58:11.115 --> 58:13.371
Ah~ This is unfiar!

58:18.057 --> 58:18.919
But wait!

58:19.174 --> 58:22.875
Could this one be the one?
Was all this searching finally done?

58:23.327 --> 58:26.095
Ah~ yes, for this was the hour

58:26.095 --> 58:29.416
Horton have found
from the 3 millions flowers.

58:29.416 --> 58:30.304
Mayor?

58:30.540 --> 58:33.837
Mayor! I found you!

58:36.121 --> 58:37.274
Mayor?

58:37.790 --> 58:38.809
Are you there?

58:39.346 --> 58:40.460
Mayor.

58:44.446 --> 58:45.492
Mayor!

58:52.506 --> 58:54.170
Mayor, are you there?

58:57.319 --> 58:58.690
Mayor.

59:04.333 --> 59:05.098
Mayor.

59:07.918 --> 59:08.800
Mayor.

59:11.181 --> 59:14.609
MA-E-Yor!!!

59:21.226 --> 59:24.168
Ah~t no. This is Floyd.

59:25.026 --> 59:26.709
Can I take a message?

59:30.824 --> 59:31.916
Mayor!

59:32.257 --> 59:34.047
You're Ou-Kei!!

59:36.048 --> 59:39.105
Horton! Horton! Stop! Stop it!

59:42.605 --> 59:43.548
Sorry.

59:43.548 --> 59:45.182
There must have been
a luck down there.

59:45.237 --> 59:46.977
I can't believe I'm in front of you.

59:47.044 --> 59:48.883
You're the heavy worried.

59:50.149 --> 59:52.437
Say. Am Mayor was right!

59:52.437 --> 59:54.835
Daddy, daddy, daddy

59:54.835 --> 59:58.064
O.K. I'm alright and so are you.

01:00:02.938 --> 01:00:05.162
Citizens of Whoville!

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:11.516
I'd like you to meet our friend Horton.

01:00:15.127 --> 01:00:16.658
He's going to help us.

01:00:18.749 --> 01:00:20.441
He-e-v-ham I've got this.

01:00:20.538 --> 01:00:22.865
This is the chairman.

01:00:22.865 --> 01:00:25.167
Idiot!! Go finish this town.

01:00:25.167 --> 01:00:28.613
Is that understood? Finished.
You BOOB!!

01:00:29.963 --> 01:00:31.317
Huh-uh I'm just joking.

01:00:36.077 --> 01:00:37.063
Good one.

01:00:37.564 --> 01:00:39.291
Horton, this is my wife Sally.

01:00:39.291 --> 01:00:42.465
You exist! This means
my husband isn't in crazy.

01:00:42.995 --> 01:00:44.655
Hooray!

01:00:44.655 --> 01:00:46.606
And... off you my daughters.

01:00:46.606 --> 01:00:49.895
- Haley, Holy, Hooly, Hilder and Heddy.
- Hi!!

01:00:49.895 --> 01:00:53.532
And here is Miss. Yelp, my royal assitant.

01:00:53.532 --> 01:00:56.097
- And here's Dr. Larue.
- You saved us.

01:00:56.097 --> 01:00:58.819
And Bert from accounting.
And Mrs. McQuilligan.

01:00:58.819 --> 01:01:01.899
And Mr. Farfoogan
from the Cloogan Farfoogans.

01:01:02.196 --> 01:01:03.914
And the oldman in bathtub.

01:01:03.914 --> 01:01:05.415
Let's not overwhelm the poor fella.

01:01:05.415 --> 01:01:07.466
He's never gonna remember
all these names.

01:01:07.466 --> 01:01:10.478
Whow. I'll try my best.

01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:12.169
Sally.

01:01:12.347 --> 01:01:13.206
Chairman.

01:01:13.341 --> 01:01:16.351
Haley, Hooly, Holy, Hilder, Heddy.
Miss. Yelp, Dr. Larue,

01:01:16.351 --> 01:01:17.758
Bert from accounting,
Mrs. McQuilligany,

01:01:17.758 --> 01:01:19.423
Mr. Farfoogan of the Cloogan Farfoogans.

01:01:19.423 --> 01:01:22.156
And wan't there an old guy in a shower.

01:01:22.358 --> 01:01:24.656
- Um, bathtub.
- Oh, Yeah!

01:01:24.656 --> 01:01:26.259
We're all here, Horton.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.412
And, We ALL believe in you.

01:01:30.827 --> 01:01:32.830
Wow! That's awesome.

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:35.609
And it's reponsibility I do not take lightly.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:39.466
I promise you a future that
it's safe, sound, and stable.

01:01:39.668 --> 01:01:44.878
We will create a world where every Who
is undoubt with 3 indelible rights

01:01:44.878 --> 01:01:47.029
To be determined that a later date.

01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:52.692
And we will put us back on Mountain Nool
before the end of this a decade.

01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:57.816
Oh!

01:01:59.156 --> 01:02:02.285
This, this is the elephant in crazy.
Oh my goodness.

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:06.280
I could tell anyone and it's to the kangaroo.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.835
Quick to they find out of them.

01:02:08.469 --> 01:02:10.549
Hoho, you should've been seeing me.

01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:12.276
I really read the elephant habit.

01:02:12.276 --> 01:02:16.924
I chase him like doorman and then
I break him into million little elephant pieces.

01:02:17.516 --> 01:02:19.640
It was thing of beauty,
Really my best work.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.263
Classic Vlad.

01:02:21.381 --> 01:02:23.805
- And the colver?
- Clover is finished.

01:02:23.805 --> 01:02:26.122
No vain million years Horton finds it.

01:02:26.122 --> 01:02:30.064
Believe my beak.
Clover is gone forever.

01:02:35.034 --> 01:02:37.624
I just saw Horton.
And he is still talking to that clover.

01:02:42.716 --> 01:02:43.712
Idiot!

01:02:43.712 --> 01:02:45.107
Whoa, come on.

01:02:45.107 --> 01:02:48.363
Hang you, Bro. It's me you're
talking to. We have history.

01:02:48.887 --> 01:02:51.844
Come on. Let's don't forget
I did this for Free.

01:02:52.774 --> 01:02:56.162
What is happening to the jungle of Nool?

01:02:56.376 --> 01:02:59.550
There once was a time
when people were people.

01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:01.535
And specks were specks.

01:03:02.202 --> 01:03:08.146
All I say it you can't see it, hear it,
or feel it it doesn't exist.

01:03:08.735 --> 01:03:11.519
Our way of life is under attack.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.708
And who's leading that attack?

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:14.796
Horton!!

01:03:14.796 --> 01:03:18.481
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute!

01:03:18.775 --> 01:03:21.336
This is Horton we're talking about
you'll know about him.

01:03:21.336 --> 01:03:24.903
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
Except for that fly city he sat on.

01:03:25.039 --> 01:03:26.496
He didn't that on purpose.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:30.654
- Shut up, mouse.
- Oh, Yeah. That's weired.

01:03:30.654 --> 01:03:33.242
I feel my brain is burning.
I got to go.

01:03:34.197 --> 01:03:39.315
Are we going to let troublemakers
like Horton poison the minds of children?

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:40.940
Not the children!!

01:03:42.001 --> 01:03:46.312
When Horton tells our children
about worlds beyond the jungle,

01:03:46.395 --> 01:03:48.613
it makes them question authority.

01:03:48.853 --> 01:03:52.827
Which leads to the fires,
which leads to shocking!!

01:03:52.827 --> 01:03:55.187
Yeah!! Horton must pay!!

01:03:55.187 --> 01:03:56.733
Eat that speck!!

01:03:56.733 --> 01:03:58.709
We have to do something!

01:03:58.709 --> 01:04:01.397
- For the children!
- For the children!

01:04:01.397 --> 01:04:06.212
Are we going to let him get away with this?

01:04:06.212 --> 01:04:11.037
No!!!

01:04:32.634 --> 01:04:36.416
Morton! I told you 100%!

01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:37.355
Horton.

01:04:37.703 --> 01:04:41.996
- Morton, pick up your feet, Gee.
- It's not me.

01:04:43.427 --> 01:04:46.475
Oh, Hoho. I see. It's an angry mob.

01:04:46.475 --> 01:04:49.725
Sorry Morton.
I thought it's you who's making all the...

01:04:49.725 --> 01:04:50.754
But it's...

01:04:51.402 --> 01:04:52.626
Hold on.

01:04:54.087 --> 01:04:55.540
Run, Horton!!

01:04:56.396 --> 01:04:57.465
There he is!!

01:04:58.918 --> 01:05:00.070
Let's grab him!

01:05:00.595 --> 01:05:01.844
Let's take him!

01:05:09.502 --> 01:05:11.348
Stop!

01:05:12.483 --> 01:05:13.463
Hey, fellas.

01:05:13.695 --> 01:05:14.530
Good to see ya.

01:05:14.672 --> 01:05:15.733
All at once.

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:17.787
You're look really great as herd.

01:05:17.787 --> 01:05:22.986
Horton, Horton, Horton look at that mess
you created for yourself.

01:05:23.475 --> 01:05:27.200
All this holible lure over us
is silly little flower.

01:05:27.581 --> 01:05:28.950
It's a speck.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.287
Right.

01:05:30.601 --> 01:05:35.689
I mean a silly really all this talk of
roping you and caging you and well

01:05:35.689 --> 01:05:38.143
we don't need to go into the details.

01:05:38.344 --> 01:05:43.369
The point is this angry mob
of all a trouble you're in.

01:05:43.474 --> 01:05:45.484
It can all go away.

01:05:47.683 --> 01:05:50.530
- Really?
- Of course.

01:05:50.749 --> 01:05:53.838
All you have to do is admit to everyone

01:05:53.838 --> 01:05:57.595
that there are no little people
living on that speck.

01:05:57.595 --> 01:06:01.326
That you're wrong and I was right.

01:06:02.165 --> 01:06:03.275
You do that,

01:06:03.275 --> 01:06:07.444
and things can go the right
back to the way they were.

01:06:07.658 --> 01:06:09.891
But, if you don't,

01:06:10.244 --> 01:06:14.119
You're going to have to pay the price.

01:06:21.057 --> 01:06:23.007
So I just have to say it isn't true?

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:32.641
Go ahead! Rope me! Cage me!
Do whatever you want!

01:06:32.898 --> 01:06:34.915
But there are people on this speck.

01:06:34.915 --> 01:06:36.413
And they have Mayor.

01:06:36.413 --> 01:06:39.287
Who has 96 daughters
and one son name JoJo,

01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:42.298
Who all share a bathroom
whatever that is.

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:46.418
And even though you can't
hear or see them at all,

01:06:47.035 --> 01:06:50.629
Person's a person,
no matter how small.

01:06:56.917 --> 01:06:59.801
That was beautiful, Horton.

01:07:00.145 --> 01:07:02.245
Rope him! Cage him!

01:07:02.245 --> 01:07:06.354
Burn that speck in a pot of
boiling pees on that oil!

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:11.616
They don't believe we're here.

01:07:12.318 --> 01:07:14.247
We've got to make some noise!

01:07:14.467 --> 01:07:16.463
We are here. We are here. We are here.

01:07:16.675 --> 01:07:20.579
We are here. We are here. We are here.
We are here. We are here. We are here.

01:07:20.579 --> 01:07:21.484
Come on!

01:07:22.454 --> 01:07:23.532
Everybody!

01:07:25.008 --> 01:07:27.026
We are here. We are here. We are here.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.207
That's what take you never make up stories
about people on specks!

01:07:39.207 --> 01:07:41.360
Listen. There they are!

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.017
- Rope him!
- Cage him!

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:48.615
It's not working.

01:07:49.366 --> 01:07:51.477
I can hear you.
But, their ears aren't strong enough.

01:07:51.679 --> 01:07:53.399
We need to be louder.

01:07:53.399 --> 01:07:56.351
Get every Who'd make noise! Everyone!

01:07:56.351 --> 01:07:59.947
We are here. We are here. We are here.
We are here. We are here. We are here.

01:07:59.947 --> 01:08:01.775
JoJo, where're you going?

01:08:02.348 --> 01:08:05.397
We need every vioice, JoJo!

01:08:08.554 --> 01:08:12.591
You need to make some noise down there.
Or we all be destroyed.

01:08:13.645 --> 01:08:16.720
The Mayor grabbed the tamtam
starting to smeck it.

01:08:18.077 --> 01:08:21.240
And all over Whoville,
They ooped up all racket.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:26.076
They rattle tin kettles,
they beat on brass pans,

01:08:26.076 --> 01:08:28.569
On garbage fills absonal,
cran berrry cans.

01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:31.462
They blew on byzu bilzl
brasstic big tubas.

01:08:31.462 --> 01:08:34.861
On durming Soom-pazum,
Boom-pazum, plutes

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.162
There!

01:08:40.429 --> 01:08:41.955
Can they hear us now?

01:08:42.331 --> 01:08:43.939
Listen! Please!

01:08:44.178 --> 01:08:46.051
It's the most beautiful thing ever!

01:08:46.395 --> 01:08:47.942
I don't hear nothing!

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:49.836
I don't think so.

01:08:50.011 --> 01:08:51.606
But, keep trying.

01:08:52.327 --> 01:08:55.077
Never give...UP!!!

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:02.020
Are you sure who the every
Who down in the Whoville is trying?

01:09:10.009 --> 01:09:10.986
Where's JoJo?

01:09:11.557 --> 01:09:13.540
Probably up the old observatory.

01:09:26.943 --> 01:09:28.274
Hey, there's our limit.

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:38.163
That's not supposed to
strech that far!

01:09:47.518 --> 01:09:48.456
JoJo!

01:09:49.337 --> 01:09:50.685
You built this!

01:10:42.696 --> 01:10:50.392
We are here.We are here.We are here.
We are here.We are here.We are here.

01:10:56.584 --> 01:10:59.358
You're making a mistake.

01:11:01.787 --> 01:11:02.262
Mom!

01:11:02.262 --> 01:11:05.515
This doesn't concern you, sweety.
Back in your pouch!

01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:12.150
Everybody, don't stop!

01:11:15.144 --> 01:11:17.217
Keep going! This gonna do it!

01:11:21.581 --> 01:11:24.196
- Can they hear?
- No!

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:35.263
No matter what happens,
I couldn't ask for better, son

01:11:39.336 --> 01:11:40.975
Ah, hey, JoJo?

01:11:41.429 --> 01:11:43.830
Come on! Keep going!

01:11:48.011 --> 01:11:49.942
NO!!!

01:11:54.132 --> 01:11:58.525
We are here.We are here.We are here.
We are here.We are here.We are here.

01:12:01.581 --> 01:12:02.854
No-oh-hoU.

01:12:04.516 --> 01:12:08.664
We are here.We are here.We are here.
We are here.We are here.We are here.

01:12:08.664 --> 01:12:11.599

01:12:19.546 --> 01:12:22.400
We are here.We are here.We are here.
We are here.We are here.We are here.

01:12:23.035 --> 01:12:26.489
I hear it! I hear it!
They are there!

01:12:26.489 --> 01:12:27.538
And that yelp.

01:12:27.949 --> 01:12:31.030
That one small extra yelp put it over.

01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:33.977
And all the Who noises brust out of the clover.

01:12:33.977 --> 01:12:35.638
- I hear it, too.
- Me too, wide.

01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:40.819
Rudy. Give me that! Come Ru...

01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:46.004
Rudy, get back in the pouch now.

01:12:48.243 --> 01:12:49.385
No, Mom.

01:12:50.755 --> 01:12:53.488
Uh, Wickersams, get that clover.

01:12:56.196 --> 01:12:59.737
What the...E..Anybody take it from him.

01:13:10.474 --> 01:13:11.737
You did it, Mayor.

01:13:12.038 --> 01:13:13.292
You did it.

01:13:14.355 --> 01:13:15.934
We did it!

01:13:18.681 --> 01:13:20.335
Yeah!!

01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:26.035
Well done, son.

01:13:27.395 --> 01:13:29.349
Alright, Mayor!

01:13:29.594 --> 01:13:32.020
Dad, you're one of the Greats.

01:13:36.006 --> 01:13:38.946
Wow! Easy everyone. Easy!

01:13:40.035 --> 01:13:41.242
Oh hi, Vlad.

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.390
Well, I shouldn't. But,

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.740
Oh man, that is nice touch.

01:14:17.614 --> 01:14:20.230
I'm a mess of this.
I got an emotional.

01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:21.816
Here come the water slide.

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:25.572
And someone if you want thank

01:14:25.823 --> 01:14:27.683
The good people of nool

01:14:27.683 --> 01:14:29.703
who put me on a cage
and fork me with sticks

01:14:29.703 --> 01:14:30.779
That was me!

01:14:31.026 --> 01:14:34.122
My buddy more than
for being the only who stood  by me

01:14:34.122 --> 01:14:36.349
Well, not right by me
he's hidden in the bushs

01:14:36.442 --> 01:14:37.782
Sending me good thoughts.

01:14:37.954 --> 01:14:38.904
He's small.

01:14:38.904 --> 01:14:41.410
Dood. You're a worrier poet.

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:44.417
And most of all I'd like to thank to
the Mayor of Whoville.

01:14:45.103 --> 01:14:48.336
- Who believed me from the beginning.
- On, Horton.

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:50.274
We're going to miss you.

01:14:50.654 --> 01:14:51.866
Hm-um, Gee

01:14:52.302 --> 01:14:54.121
What are we gonna do without you, Horton?

01:14:54.121 --> 01:14:55.316
Ah, don't worry.

01:14:55.764 --> 01:14:57.182
I always be around.

01:14:58.114 --> 01:15:01.909
- And even as I wonder,
- On~

01:15:01.909 --> 01:15:03.339
Keeping in them sight.

01:15:03.525 --> 01:15:06.083
You're a candle in the window.

01:15:06.083 --> 01:15:09.263
- On a cool dark winter's night.
- Beautiful metaphor.

01:15:09.263 --> 01:15:16.223
And I'm getting closer than
I ever thought I might.

01:15:16.223 --> 01:15:17.916
Uh, that's a little high funnys.

01:15:18.886 --> 01:15:24.171
Baby, I can't fight this feeling any more.

01:15:24.406 --> 01:15:29.531
I've forgotten what I started fighting for.

01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:34.138
- And if I have to crawl upon the floor.
- Crawl upon the floor.

01:15:34.138 --> 01:15:36.937
- Come crashing through your door.
- Crashing through your door.

01:15:36.937 --> 01:15:40.091
Baby I can't fight this feeling any more.

01:15:40.091 --> 01:15:50.333
I can't fight this feeling any more.

01:15:50.333 --> 01:15:54.672
And so all ended well
for those Horton and Whos.

01:15:54.672 --> 01:15:57.642
And for all in the jungle, even Kangaroos.

01:15:57.925 --> 01:16:00.934
So let that be a lesson to one and to all

01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:03.124
A person's a person.

01:16:03.817 --> 01:16:06.519
No matter how small.
