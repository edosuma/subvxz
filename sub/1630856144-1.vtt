You still got the

02:08.084 --> 02:08.824

Pete, take my SUV,

- Why?

- Wait, what?

02:33.588 --> 02:35.242
Why?

02:35.285 --> 02:36.460
- To give you a little time
to think about thinking twice

02:36.504 --> 02:39.115
before you open up your
fucking mouth again.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.812

04:47.112 --> 04:48.113
- [Martin] Well, ever
since this president

04:48.157 --> 04:49.114
weakened our military,

04:49.158 --> 04:50.638
we sent a signal to the world

04:50.681 --> 04:51.856
that they can do
whatever they want

04:51.900 --> 04:53.902
and we're just gonna
sit down and take it.

How do you connect the president
to this wave of abductions?

04:58.167 --> 04:59.603

use it against us.

about how life works

06:49.409 --> 06:51.672

responds to the call.

06:51.715 --> 06:54.457
Then he or she takes
an initial report.

You said that your
son was missing

07:17.349 --> 07:20.004
when you got back from the

[bell dings]

07:22.485 --> 07:23.791

Yeah, just, just
put it anywhere.

07:56.737 --> 07:58.347
When you reported
your son missing-

07:58.390 --> 07:59.348
- It was her.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.264
[door clicks]

08:02.307 --> 08:03.178
She did.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.615

That one, she's
always up in my shit.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.274
I told her it was none
of her goddamn business.

08:12.317 --> 08:13.754

08:13.797 --> 08:15.059
- [Wendy] Oh, you're an animal.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.800
- Where's that sweet baby?

08:16.844 --> 08:19.281
You probably pawned
him for some smack.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.152
She belongs in jail.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.503
- No, you should get arrested!
- No, no, no!

08:23.546 --> 08:25.113
- And put in hospice.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.507
You and your dried up cunt
can go dry up in jail.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.030
- [Neighbor] They're
gonna drag you out.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.162
- Oh, you think you're
better than everybody.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.469
- [Santiago] I think that,

08:33.513 --> 08:35.950
I think I fucking hate people.

08:38.605 --> 08:41.172
It is what it is, I guess.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.914
But what it is, is
definitely shit.

08:45.089 --> 08:45.960
- So it's gonna be a win.

08:46.003 --> 08:47.309
It's gonna be an easy slash

08:47.352 --> 08:50.138
and Jim and Carol are
gonna be really happy.

08:50.181 --> 08:51.008

08:51.052 --> 08:52.270

Ah, it's Sue, do you
mind if I take this?

Do you wanna talk to her?

09:20.255 --> 09:21.822
She might be willing
to forgive you.

09:38.882 --> 09:41.581

- How about when I
come home tonight,

09:46.977 --> 09:49.632
I will read you a book,
not mommy, but daddy?

09:49.676 --> 09:51.155

- Okay, bye honey.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.244

10:14.265 --> 10:14.875
- Have a seat.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.230
Hey, Rishi, you can
eat that shrimp?

10:22.926 --> 10:24.406
- Nah.

10:24.449 --> 10:25.233
- You don't like shrimp?

10:25.276 --> 10:26.713
- I don't eat Croatians.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.587
- What did you say?

10:31.631 --> 10:34.851
- I said I don't eat Croatians.

10:34.895 --> 10:38.028
- Hey, Rishi, I'll take
all your Croatians.

10:38.072 --> 10:41.075
- You mean crustacean
you fucking moron?

10:41.118 --> 10:43.643
- I don't eat sea cockroaches.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.906
- Why did you order shrimp if
you're not going to eat it?

10:45.949 --> 10:47.429
- The menu said prawn.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.910
I thought prawn was like
chicken or something.

10:49.953 --> 10:50.737

the motherfucker.

gonna eat the shrimp?

to this party?

- Professionalism.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.987
Got my sources and I know
how to handle things.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.078
The way I look at
it, my job is to,

11:29.558 --> 11:30.864
is to help you sleep at night.

11:32.561 --> 11:35.433
- I don't know, boss, but
something about this guy stinks.

11:35.477 --> 11:36.739
- Big John brought him.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.794
- Hey, Big John.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.798
Do I stink?

11:51.841 --> 11:52.842
- Don't smell bad to me.

11:55.671 --> 11:58.108
- You know, I would never
ever let a green horn

11:58.152 --> 12:00.110
take on a job like this.

12:00.154 --> 12:03.157
- I'm just looking for a
little bit of stability,

12:03.200 --> 12:06.464
and I'm hoping that
if I do my job right,

12:06.508 --> 12:08.249
you're happy with it,

12:08.292 --> 12:09.946
then maybe one day
you'll put in a good word

12:09.990 --> 12:10.773
for me at the firm.

12:14.864 --> 12:19.651
- Listen, kid, everybody
thinks this trade is, is easy,

12:20.348 --> 12:21.218
but it's not.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.265
It's just like every
other big corporation,

12:24.308 --> 12:27.137
you got people under you,
you got people above you.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.399
But at the end of the day,

12:28.443 --> 12:29.966
you still gotta
pay all your bills.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.926
You gotta pay your, your
mortgage, your property taxes.

12:32.969 --> 12:35.276
- Well, if you're
passing out advice,

12:35.319 --> 12:37.278
I'd take it anytime, man.

12:37.321 --> 12:38.235
Just wanna work.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.804
[traffic humming]

12:41.848 --> 12:44.198
- Hey, look, I, I
should probably go in

12:44.241 --> 12:45.503
and finish this lunch,

12:45.547 --> 12:48.593
but I will try and be
home as soon as possible

12:48.637 --> 12:51.727
and I'll read our little
nugget of book, okay?

12:51.771 --> 12:53.598
- Okay.
- All right, I love you.

12:53.642 --> 12:54.861
- [Susan] I love you too.

12:54.904 --> 12:55.644
- Bye, honey.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.565
[group chattering]

13:03.608 --> 13:04.740
- Is everything okay?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.742
- Yeah, everything's great.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.222
Find anything you like.

13:08.265 --> 13:09.353
- Steak salad.

13:09.397 --> 13:10.702
I'm celebrating.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.095
- It's really good
here, trust me.

13:13.618 --> 13:15.707
All right, what do I want?

13:16.534 --> 13:19.320
[Jerry laughing]

13:22.671 --> 13:24.455
Hey, give me one second.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.154
I'll be right back.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.635
[Jerry laughs]

13:30.679 --> 13:32.942
- And just before
it was executed

13:32.986 --> 13:34.596
by the great state of Texas,

13:34.639 --> 13:36.859
my Uncle Davey said, kid,
"I got some advice for you."

13:37.991 --> 13:39.296
"Your home is your temple."

13:39.340 --> 13:41.995
"Never, ever bring your
business home with you,

13:42.038 --> 13:43.648
otherwise, you'll
always be working."

13:44.954 --> 13:46.521
"Keep your professional
life separate

13:46.564 --> 13:47.739
from your personal life."

13:50.830 --> 13:51.700
- [Max] Jerry.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.007
What are you doing here?

13:54.050 --> 13:55.660
Haven't heard from
you in months.

13:55.704 --> 13:56.444
Hey, hey.

13:59.055 --> 13:59.795
- Hey, what's up?

14:01.231 --> 14:03.364
Listen, this is not a
good time for me, man.

14:03.407 --> 14:04.931
- What's going on?

14:04.974 --> 14:06.758
- Can you not see I'm
talking business, man?

14:11.154 --> 14:12.895
I'll holler at you
when I can, all right?

14:14.244 --> 14:15.680
- What's your deal?

14:15.724 --> 14:17.465
- Well, what's my deal, man?

14:19.771 --> 14:21.208
You need to get outta here, man.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.688
I'll call you when
I can, all right?

14:23.732 --> 14:25.342
You're doing this
to me way too much.

14:28.084 --> 14:28.868
What are you deaf?

14:30.608 --> 14:31.914
I said get outta here, dude.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.395
- Okay.

14:34.438 --> 14:35.875
- [Jerry] Yeah, okay.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.882
[ominous music]

14:42.925 --> 14:44.666
- Everything okay?

14:44.709 --> 14:47.625
- That guy there is
a, he's my lawyer.

14:48.757 --> 14:49.976
Got me a plea deal

14:50.019 --> 14:51.978
and got out of
Walla Walla early.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.896
Guess the guy thinks we're
friends now or something.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.637
Keeps, keeps asking me
for referrals and shit.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.815
Fucking lawyers,
blood sucking pricks.

15:05.905 --> 15:06.906
- Okay, kids, we're
finished here.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.211
I gotta get home.

15:08.255 --> 15:09.169
I got a new table
being delivered.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.474
I wanna make sure those assholes

15:10.518 --> 15:11.998
don't shatter the
glass this time.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.888
- What are you drinking?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.150
- Coffee.

15:34.194 --> 15:37.371
- Hey, hun, do you
have a business card?

15:38.546 --> 15:39.416
- Yeah.

15:41.244 --> 15:42.506
- My brother's
down in Walla Walla

15:42.550 --> 15:44.769
and he's PD officer
is fucking useless

15:44.813 --> 15:46.380
and I hear you're
a big shot fixer,

15:46.423 --> 15:49.252
so I may need some
of your services.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.341
- But we don't do criminal law.

15:51.385 --> 15:52.473
- I was talking to him.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.868
- Um, no criminal law, really?

15:56.912 --> 15:59.654
- No, we're real
estate attorneys.

15:59.697 --> 16:00.960
- Ah.
- Just real estate.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.048
- Such a bummer.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.530
Can I keep your card anyways?

16:06.574 --> 16:07.401
- Yeah, go ahead.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.535
Do whatever you want with it.

16:11.579 --> 16:12.188
- See ya.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.497
- Who was that?

16:16.540 --> 16:17.977
- I have no idea.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.370
That was just weird, right?

16:22.242 --> 16:23.069
You know what?

16:24.766 --> 16:26.246
She was sitting at that table
where my brother was at.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.596
And-
- Your brother?

16:28.639 --> 16:30.337
- He's not there anymore.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.992
[traffic humming]

16:34.210 --> 16:35.168
- How was your weekend?

16:36.908 --> 16:37.997
- Boring.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.390
- You think
everything is boring.

16:40.434 --> 16:41.043
- Isn't it?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.003
- Yeah, what's you cats do?

16:45.526 --> 16:46.135
- Nothing.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.793
- Come on, I haven't seen
you guys for three days.

16:51.836 --> 16:54.056
- We watched that
movie last night.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.319
- Yeah, but you
wouldn't like it, Dad.

16:56.363 --> 16:59.192
It had a happy ending.

16:59.235 --> 17:00.236
- Can I go to Japan?

17:02.064 --> 17:03.022
- You fucking with me.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.634
- Listen, I, I got
it all figured out.

17:06.677 --> 17:09.158
Tickets, trains, where to stay.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.812
I got money.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.335
I, I saved it from working

17:12.379 --> 17:14.903
at the farmer's
market on weekends.

17:14.946 --> 17:16.296
I just need help with
the plane ticket,

17:16.339 --> 17:18.124
but I could pay for the
most of the trip myself.

17:19.255 --> 17:20.213
- I'll talk to grandma.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.303
Maybe she could pay for it.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.003
- Wait, I wanna go to Japan too.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.354
- No, no, no, you're
you're not going with me.

17:31.398 --> 17:32.703
- Why not?

17:32.747 --> 17:34.140
- Because you're annoying.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.446
- How come always
gets what he wants?

17:36.490 --> 17:37.839
- God, you're such
a whiny little shit.

17:37.882 --> 17:38.709
- And you're a dick.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.494
- Hey, hey, hey.

17:40.537 --> 17:41.147
All right.

17:42.713 --> 17:43.453
Quit your bitching.

17:51.679 --> 17:54.073
[phone ringing]

17:58.164 --> 18:00.557
- Jerry, what the
hell was that, huh?

18:01.906 --> 18:02.777
Jerry?

18:04.996 --> 18:05.910
Jerry, you there?

18:07.695 --> 18:08.696
Hey man.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.133
[ominous music]

18:13.353 --> 18:16.138
Jerry, can you hear me?

18:20.795 --> 18:23.450
[siren wailing]

18:24.712 --> 18:27.541
[suspenseful music]

18:31.675 --> 18:33.155
He'll call back.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.767
[ominous music]

18:46.908 --> 18:48.605
[computer ringing]

18:48.649 --> 18:49.737
- Hi.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.304
- [Max] Hey.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.001
- I thought you
would be home soon.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.568
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.744
Is she asleep?

18:56.787 --> 18:58.528
- Yeah, she's
sleeping after a bath.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.269
She was just out like a light.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.879
- I think I'm gonna have to
pull another all nighter.

19:01.923 --> 19:04.665
This presentation I gotta
do it at 9:00 AM tomorrow

19:04.708 --> 19:06.406
and it's just.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.669
- [scoffs] Again.

19:08.712 --> 19:11.628
- Hey, you didn't tell Ari
about our trip, did you?

19:11.672 --> 19:13.587
- [Susan] No, of course not.

19:13.630 --> 19:14.762
- Good, good.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.851
[tense ominous music]
[Max groans]

19:16.894 --> 19:18.200
- Was that a brain zap?

19:18.244 --> 19:19.419
- [Max] Mm-hmm.

19:19.462 --> 19:22.726
- [Susan] Are you gonna be okay?

19:22.770 --> 19:25.120
[Max groans]

19:26.382 --> 19:27.688
- Oh, man.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.168
- But you have your
pills on you, right?

19:29.211 --> 19:31.692
- [Max] [sighs] No.

19:31.735 --> 19:34.260
I, I didn't think I was
gonna stay here this long.

19:35.565 --> 19:36.871
- Max.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.525
- I know, I know,
I know, I know.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.918
I promise I'll take them as
soon as I get home tomorrow.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.616
- [Susan] And when will that be?

19:42.659 --> 19:44.531
- Before noon.

19:44.574 --> 19:46.924
And then it's straight family
quality time, I promise.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.665
- Okay, bye baby.

19:48.709 --> 19:49.710
- [Max] Love you.

19:49.753 --> 19:50.580
See you soon.

19:55.672 --> 19:58.371
[doorbell buzzing]

20:03.071 --> 20:03.811
[button clicks]

20:03.854 --> 20:05.595
- Yeah.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.945
- [Jerry] Hey, it's Jerry.

20:07.989 --> 20:10.165
Can I, can I come in?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.255
- Yeah, Jerry, come up.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.169
I'm buzzing you in.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.867
[buzzer buzzes]

20:25.136 --> 20:26.181
- [Ari] Mommy.

20:28.183 --> 20:30.446
- What are you
doing up right now?

20:30.490 --> 20:32.579
You're supposed to be
sleeping, aren't you sleepy?

20:32.622 --> 20:33.536
- Uh-uh.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.538
- Okay, Jerry, come up.

20:35.582 --> 20:36.887
Your Uncle Jerry's stopping by.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.541
You can say hi then
back to bed, okay?

20:40.369 --> 20:42.676
[ominous music]

20:42.719 --> 20:45.505
[Jerry whimpering]

20:52.294 --> 20:53.164
- I'm so sorry.

20:54.383 --> 20:55.210
I am.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.865
- Oh my God, Jerry.

20:57.908 --> 21:00.128
[footsteps tapping]

21:00.171 --> 21:02.696
[suspenseful music]

21:02.739 --> 21:05.481
[brooding music]

21:09.746 --> 21:11.748
- Even if the PUD had expired,

21:11.792 --> 21:13.837
the regular zoning
laws and fire codes

21:13.881 --> 21:16.623
would not allow the complex
to be built next to the mall.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.015
And from what I've been hearing,

21:18.059 --> 21:19.321
there's a lot of talk

21:19.365 --> 21:20.496
about putting in a
dog park next to us.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.890
So as far as I'm concerned,

21:22.933 --> 21:24.152
Jean, I'm in a meeting.

21:27.982 --> 21:30.854
- Max Kelly, Detective Santiago.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.248
Can I have a word with you?

21:34.205 --> 21:36.077
- Oh, Jean, one minute please.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.427
What's this about?

21:38.471 --> 21:39.298
- Outside.

21:41.169 --> 21:43.911
[dramatic music]

21:45.173 --> 21:47.044
- [Susan] You forgot
it was early out today.

21:48.002 --> 21:49.656
Do you wanna talk to her?

21:49.699 --> 21:51.658
She might be willing
to forgive you.

21:53.442 --> 21:55.009
- [Ari] Hi, daddy.

21:55.879 --> 21:57.751
Nah, I knew you forgot.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.143
I'm drawing.

21:59.187 --> 22:01.102
Are you coming to my
cheerleading practice?

22:01.145 --> 22:04.758
You're always working.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.020
Okay, bye daddy.

22:10.807 --> 22:12.940
[group chattering]

22:12.983 --> 22:14.333
- Thank you, Kristy.

22:15.682 --> 22:16.291
Thank you.

22:17.510 --> 22:18.685
Corner's preliminary.

22:19.686 --> 22:20.382
- It's about time.

22:23.385 --> 22:26.170
- Victim one, Dr. Susan Kelly.

22:26.214 --> 22:27.824
Multiple stab wounds.

22:27.868 --> 22:31.654
Second victim was FBI
agent Gerald Kelly.

22:31.698 --> 22:34.222
This guy's brother,
multiple stab wounds,

22:34.265 --> 22:36.398
couple of missing fingers,

22:36.442 --> 22:39.619
other fingers had paper clips
inserted under their nails.

22:42.143 --> 22:44.885
- [Vasquez] This looks
pretty black and white to me.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.756
Daddy comes home early,

22:46.800 --> 22:49.019
finds mommy with the
brother going at it.

22:49.063 --> 22:50.717
It's a crime of passion.

22:53.589 --> 22:57.419
- What we have is
a dead FBI agent.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.639
The feds are gonna take
this over in a heartbeat.

22:59.682 --> 23:00.901
So we've gotta get
outta their way

23:00.944 --> 23:02.468
and focus on finding that child

23:02.511 --> 23:04.339
while we still have
any jurisdiction left.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.819
- This guy's clean.

23:05.862 --> 23:08.256
Someone murdered his family

23:08.299 --> 23:09.866
so why don't we
cut him some slack

23:09.910 --> 23:12.608
and uh, think about it, it
could be one of us in there.

23:16.177 --> 23:18.962
- [Vasquez] How can you
be so sure it wasn't him?

23:20.355 --> 23:22.313
- Because I'm a very
good judge of character.

23:22.357 --> 23:24.664
[Daniels scoffs]

23:24.707 --> 23:26.100
What?

23:26.143 --> 23:27.710
- Let's just say good judgment's

23:27.754 --> 23:29.190
not the first thing
that pops into my head

23:29.233 --> 23:30.844
when I see your pretty face.

23:32.236 --> 23:34.151
- Oh, you wanna go there?

23:34.195 --> 23:35.979
- No.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.416
- I want you to go in
there and talk to this man.

23:38.460 --> 23:41.245
- This guy and I
sat for 12 years

23:41.289 --> 23:43.422
in the same black and white.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.336
We had a coffee together,
had lunch together.

23:46.729 --> 23:49.602
Look at him now, the
big fucking boss.

23:52.213 --> 23:53.083
Sure.

23:58.698 --> 24:01.309
[Daniels sighs]

24:01.352 --> 24:03.180
- Takes a few decades
to get to know him.

24:05.444 --> 24:09.012
[brooding music]

24:09.056 --> 24:11.711
- You and your
brother got arrested

24:13.103 --> 24:14.931
drifting cars in
the parking lot.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.412
The abandoned steam plant.

24:19.980 --> 24:20.894
Joined the Navy.

24:23.592 --> 24:24.463
What happened to you?

24:26.334 --> 24:27.335
Dishonorable discharge.

24:30.338 --> 24:31.252
- It's complicated.

24:34.298 --> 24:35.474
- It always is, isn't it?

24:44.744 --> 24:48.530
Your brother, Agent Kelly
called you at 9:00 PM,

24:50.271 --> 24:51.315
what he'd want?

24:51.359 --> 24:53.840
- I don't know, all right.

24:53.883 --> 24:56.320
He called me, I
couldn't hear anything.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.366
Thought he'd call me
back, but he never did.

24:59.585 --> 25:00.716
- And when you saw
him at the restaurant,

25:00.760 --> 25:02.283
did you recognize
anybody was with him?

25:02.326 --> 25:03.850
- No.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.199
I didn't recognize
anyone with him.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.723
Have you found my daughter yet?

25:10.421 --> 25:11.684
- We're knocking on every door.

25:13.773 --> 25:15.296
We're also searching
all over Discovery Park

25:15.339 --> 25:17.037
an Lincoln Park.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.779
We have to plan for
any possible scenario.

25:24.305 --> 25:26.307
Look, I got two kids of my own,

25:26.350 --> 25:29.136
so it could be me
in your situation.

25:31.138 --> 25:33.314
Trust me when I
tell you that I'm,

25:33.357 --> 25:34.924
I care and I'm
gonna do everything

25:34.968 --> 25:36.535
I can to find your daughter.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.112
- What are they like?

25:50.984 --> 25:51.854
- Who?

25:53.726 --> 25:54.770
- Your, your kids?

25:59.383 --> 26:00.428
- [sighs] I don't know.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.605
Typical teenagers, I guess.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.088
Don't get to see them much.

26:10.960 --> 26:11.787
Probably my fault.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.182
Having trouble with the Mrs.

26:18.272 --> 26:22.798
But when we're together, it's
all, all good quality time.

26:27.542 --> 26:30.197
- Should have been all quantity.

26:31.285 --> 26:31.981
- [Santiago] What?

26:35.115 --> 26:39.032
- Any time you spend with
your child is quality time.

26:41.774 --> 26:44.559
What would you do
if you were me?

26:47.301 --> 26:48.607
- [Santiago] How do you mean?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.960
- If you found out
someone murdered,

26:54.003 --> 26:58.660
murdered your whole
family, what would you do?

27:01.532 --> 27:05.536
- Oh, uh, buddy, I'm,
I'm the wrong guy to ask.

27:06.494 --> 27:10.324
- What would you do?

27:12.369 --> 27:14.154
- Well

27:18.288 --> 27:19.768
I'm a simple man

27:21.988 --> 27:25.687
and so I probably would
put them on a chair.

27:27.297 --> 27:28.255
- Oh, shit.

27:32.346 --> 27:35.828
- And then I would wack them
with one of them nail bats.

27:37.438 --> 27:38.569
You know, the ones
with the nails

27:38.613 --> 27:40.136
and the barbed wire all over.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.708
Then I would swing
until my arms fell off.

27:48.536 --> 27:49.755
I can't even think
about that shit

27:49.798 --> 27:52.540
without getting my
fucking blood boiling.

27:52.583 --> 27:56.370
But fucking monsters
don't get a second chance

27:58.546 --> 28:00.287
because they will do it again.

28:02.289 --> 28:04.857
[door clicks]

28:04.900 --> 28:07.642
[door bangs]

28:07.686 --> 28:08.948
- [Daniels] Detective Santiago,

28:08.991 --> 28:10.645
may I have a word with
you outside please.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.092
Mr. Kelly, I'm so
sorry about that.

28:23.136 --> 28:26.617
That is not a reflection on
this department in any way.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.532
- [Max] Look, I can't
sit here anymore.

28:28.576 --> 28:29.751
- Well, you can't go home.

28:29.795 --> 28:32.101
Your house is a crime
scene right now.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.799
You'd be better off
staying here with us.

28:34.887 --> 28:35.714
- Am I free to go?

28:37.411 --> 28:39.587
- [Daniels] Yes,
of course you are.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.023
Where are you going?

28:43.069 --> 28:45.724
[ominous music]

28:47.116 --> 28:51.599
[birds chirping]
[group chattering]

28:52.469 --> 28:54.776
[Max crying]

29:05.744 --> 29:08.398
[ominous music]

29:41.344 --> 29:43.694
[Max crying]

29:52.181 --> 29:54.575
[suspenseful music]

29:54.618 --> 29:56.925
- Don't make a fucking sound.

29:56.969 --> 29:58.231
[Max grunts]
[elbow thuds]

29:58.274 --> 29:59.798
[elbow thuds]
[Big John groans]

29:59.841 --> 30:00.755
[Max grunts]

30:00.799 --> 30:02.017
[body thuds]

30:02.061 --> 30:03.410
- Who the fuck are you?

30:03.453 --> 30:04.715
- I'm Jerry's friend.

30:04.759 --> 30:05.891
- What are you doing here?

30:05.934 --> 30:06.805
- Had no place to go.

30:08.850 --> 30:09.895
- What's in the bag?

30:12.985 --> 30:14.725
- [Big John] Take it.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.744
- What the fuck you
doing with an M68?

30:35.137 --> 30:37.313
- I just carrying them
with me for good luck.

30:37.357 --> 30:40.795
You know, as in I never know
when I'm gonna need good luck.

30:42.492 --> 30:44.103
Kind of like a
condom in my pocket.

30:45.060 --> 30:45.931
Oh, Jerry told me to give you-

30:45.974 --> 30:47.323
- Hey, hey, hey.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.461
- Jerry said, "If
anything happened to him

30:54.504 --> 30:56.158
give 'em only to you."

30:56.202 --> 30:58.769
Jerry had a bad feeling

30:58.813 --> 31:01.294
when Ellis suddenly
changed the plans.

31:01.337 --> 31:02.861
- What, what plan?

31:04.601 --> 31:06.429
Look man, I don't understand
what you're talking about.

31:06.473 --> 31:08.475
- What the fuck you
don't understand?

31:08.518 --> 31:10.781
We all in this shit
because of you bitch.

31:10.825 --> 31:12.044
- What are you talking about?

31:12.087 --> 31:14.220
- You blew his fucking cover.

31:14.263 --> 31:16.265
He was working his
way into the crew.

31:16.309 --> 31:19.181
Everything was going fine
till your dumb ass showed up.

31:19.225 --> 31:21.880
[ominous music]

31:23.969 --> 31:25.448
- It's been about
over a half hour.

31:30.671 --> 31:31.628
Should I bring him in?

31:33.848 --> 31:34.718
Okay.

31:36.416 --> 31:40.202
- The firm traffics human
organs, hearts, livers, kidneys.

31:41.682 --> 31:42.988
They dice up little kids
and sell 'em like parts

31:43.031 --> 31:45.120
for like a fucking
Toyota truck, man.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.948
We used to sell guns
for the cartels,

31:46.992 --> 31:48.732
but the cut up kids for money,

31:50.212 --> 31:51.779
that shit ain't Christian yo.

31:51.822 --> 31:52.823
[knuckles tapping]

31:52.867 --> 31:53.607
- [Vasquez] Mr. Kelly.

31:53.650 --> 31:54.913
It's Detective Vasquez.

31:56.044 --> 31:57.480
- Fuck!
- She's a cop.

31:57.524 --> 31:58.873
She can help us.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.441
Look, I'm looking for
my daughter, all right?

32:01.484 --> 32:04.096
So you're gonna tell her
everything you just told me.

32:04.139 --> 32:04.966
- We can't, man.

32:05.010 --> 32:05.793
We can't.

32:05.836 --> 32:07.490
- [Max] Why?

32:07.534 --> 32:08.927
- Because she's one of them.

32:08.970 --> 32:10.493
[knuckles tapping]

32:10.537 --> 32:13.018
- [Vasquez] Mr. Kelly, you're
not supposed to be here.

32:13.801 --> 32:14.541
- You best leave, man.

32:14.584 --> 32:15.759
I'll take care of her.

32:16.804 --> 32:18.240
Go!

32:18.284 --> 32:21.069
[suspenseful music]

32:27.162 --> 32:29.991
[door clicks]

32:30.035 --> 32:32.863
[footsteps tapping]

32:43.178 --> 32:44.658
- No fucking way.

32:46.747 --> 32:48.053
What the fuck happened?

32:49.054 --> 32:50.577
- Basically, guy beat
the shit outta me.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.405
Ran out through the fire escape.

32:52.448 --> 32:54.276
- Everyone's looking for you.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.930
- I know.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.759
I came looking for the
cash to bring it to Ellis.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.456
- Oh really?

33:00.500 --> 33:02.937
[gun banging]
[Big John groans]

33:02.981 --> 33:07.768
[Big John gurgling]
[ominous music]

33:16.646 --> 33:19.301
Where is the money?

33:19.345 --> 33:24.002
- [chuckles] Get you on
the other side, bitch.

33:25.612 --> 33:27.266
[suspenseful music]
[grenade thuds]

33:27.309 --> 33:28.267
- Oh fuck!

33:28.310 --> 33:30.660
[explosion booming]

33:30.704 --> 33:33.533
[car alarm wailing]

33:34.751 --> 33:35.709
- Oh, shit.

33:38.494 --> 33:41.280
[suspenseful music]

33:57.383 --> 33:59.994
[brooding music]

34:10.787 --> 34:13.877
[melancholic music]

34:59.706 --> 35:02.230
[brooding music]

35:02.274 --> 35:05.190
[seagulls squawking]

35:09.803 --> 35:12.893
[suspenseful music]

35:25.732 --> 35:26.950
[keys clicking]

35:26.994 --> 35:30.476
[high pitched tone]

35:30.519 --> 35:33.043
[Max groaning]

35:34.915 --> 35:37.265
[body thuds]

35:40.312 --> 35:42.618
[Max groans]

36:03.726 --> 36:05.685
[birds chirping]

36:05.728 --> 36:08.731
[group chattering]

36:08.775 --> 36:09.776
[door clicks]
[body thuds]

36:09.819 --> 36:12.692
[Santiago grunts]

36:19.786 --> 36:21.004
- What is this?

36:21.048 --> 36:23.746
- That is $50,000 in cash.

36:23.790 --> 36:26.967
We found that in Detective
Vasquez's apartment last night.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.098
That and a pound of blow.

36:32.886 --> 36:33.756
She was your partner.

36:39.675 --> 36:42.591
[Santiago sighs]

36:42.635 --> 36:44.376
- Feel free to check my
apartment and you find anything,

36:44.419 --> 36:46.552
you know, give half to Hanna

36:46.595 --> 36:48.293
because I'm fucking
behind on rent.

36:51.426 --> 36:52.862
- Didn't I tell you
the Max Kelly case

36:52.906 --> 36:53.863
was with the Feds now?

36:55.604 --> 36:57.606
- You certainly made a point
to mention something equivalent

36:57.650 --> 36:58.303
to that statement.

37:05.310 --> 37:09.792
- [Daniels] Max Kelly's
military records, roadside bomb.

37:11.403 --> 37:15.145
Only survivor, head
trauma, and PTSD.

37:16.886 --> 37:18.671
He spent a couple of years
in Massachusetts recovering

37:18.714 --> 37:20.281
so who knows?

37:29.159 --> 37:30.030
- So that's it?

37:32.032 --> 37:34.034
- They closed the case
as a murder suicide.

37:35.949 --> 37:37.167
- Don't make any sense.

37:38.517 --> 37:40.562
- Focus on finding
those kids, would you?

37:40.606 --> 37:41.650
- Right.

37:41.694 --> 37:42.738
Okie dokie.

37:47.439 --> 37:50.355
- Santi, if I find out
you're dirty, I swear to God,

37:50.398 --> 37:52.139
I'll put a fucking
bullet in your head.

37:55.621 --> 37:56.230
- Sounds fair.

38:01.540 --> 38:05.631
[door thuds]
[Santiago groans]

38:05.674 --> 38:10.244
[traffic humming]
[birds chirping]

38:11.071 --> 38:13.639
[group chattering]

38:18.644 --> 38:20.994
- [sighs] When's
he gonna get here?

38:23.431 --> 38:26.304
- Let me just wrap this up
and I will be right with you.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.743
- I'm here to meet with Mr.
Tank, not his secretary.

38:37.967 --> 38:41.449
- I understand it's unusual
to go by different pronouns,

38:41.493 --> 38:44.887
but I prefer the mister as it
seems to be less disruptive

38:44.931 --> 38:46.628
for official business.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.327
- You're Mr. Tank.

38:51.067 --> 38:52.895
- It's a man's world.

38:52.939 --> 38:54.549
The fact that you assumed

38:54.593 --> 38:57.073
I wasn't a person worthy
of power proves my point.

39:00.294 --> 39:01.339
- And why meet here?

39:03.079 --> 39:05.604
- I believe it is better to
meet in a friendly environment

39:05.647 --> 39:08.563
where you and I can feel
safe and comfortable

39:08.607 --> 39:09.564
to speak openly.

39:10.696 --> 39:11.305
Don't you agree?

39:13.873 --> 39:14.743
- And who's he?

39:16.484 --> 39:20.749
- That is Kevin, my assistant.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.229
May I offer you a latte?

39:23.056 --> 39:24.753
Come on, blend in.

39:24.797 --> 39:26.102
Do you like milk in your coffee?

39:26.146 --> 39:27.539
Do you like it sweet?

39:27.582 --> 39:28.888
- I'm fine.

39:28.931 --> 39:32.065
- Can you please get him
a half-caf vanilla latte

39:32.108 --> 39:34.807
with six pumps of vanilla
and whipped cream on top?

39:36.635 --> 39:40.378
Make sure you use the app
so I can redeem my points.

39:47.559 --> 39:50.692
You receive a very fair
fee for your services,

39:50.736 --> 39:53.216
and over time you
have been considered

39:53.260 --> 39:55.393
to be a valuable
asset to the firm.

39:57.220 --> 40:00.441
May I ask how it is
that you ended up

40:00.485 --> 40:04.358
with an FBI agent
infiltrating your team?

40:04.402 --> 40:06.360
- He came from a
very reliable source.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.449
- And where's this
reliable source now?

40:08.493 --> 40:10.320
- That's been taken care of.

40:10.364 --> 40:11.539
- [Mr. Tank] And the FBI agent?

40:11.583 --> 40:12.932
- That's been
taken care of also.

40:14.629 --> 40:15.413
- And the currency?

40:17.502 --> 40:18.416
- I'm working on that.

40:24.726 --> 40:27.250
- Based on what has
transgressed here,

40:27.294 --> 40:30.340
I'm left with two
possible conclusions.

40:30.384 --> 40:34.606
One is that your judgment
is no longer reliable,

40:34.649 --> 40:37.739
which in our business
is not a good virtue

40:37.783 --> 40:41.221
or two, that you
were somehow involved

40:41.264 --> 40:43.484
in an elaborate piece of fiction

40:43.528 --> 40:47.053
in order to bamboozle the
firm for your last demotion.

40:47.096 --> 40:49.925
I know, I know, it's a
ridiculous speculation.

40:49.969 --> 40:52.798
And what you have done for
the firm over the years

40:52.841 --> 40:55.278
has been taken into account

40:55.322 --> 40:59.326
and it has gotten you
a one time courtesy.

41:01.241 --> 41:04.026
I trust you will
rectify the situation.

41:04.070 --> 41:08.683
Neither you, the firm,
myself, nor Kevin here,

41:08.727 --> 41:12.470
wish this issue to go
in any other direction.

41:19.128 --> 41:22.436
I understand you used to run
weapons to the Mexican cartels.

41:24.003 --> 41:24.612
- Yes.

41:33.534 --> 41:35.275

41:39.235 --> 41:40.410
And there you are.

Now go do your

you gonna move back in?

43:57.547 --> 43:59.158
- [Santiago] I don't know, son.

43:59.201 --> 44:02.030
- [Ray] Well, I'm just saying
you better think of something.

44:05.033 --> 44:05.643
- Why?

44:10.517 --> 44:11.997
- I think mom's got
a new boyfriend.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.041
- Jesus, Ray.

44:13.085 --> 44:13.955
Shut up.

44:15.217 --> 44:16.697
- Kenny something.

44:16.741 --> 44:18.307
She was telling
grandma on the phone.

44:20.614 --> 44:22.660
- Mom just said, "He was
nice to her from work."

44:24.052 --> 44:25.924
I guess he likes her
and gave her flowers.

44:25.967 --> 44:29.405
- See, Dad, how come you
never bring mom flowers?

44:30.842 --> 44:32.321

like to stir the pot?

Be right there.

45:17.932 --> 45:19.151
Thanks for bringing them up.

45:19.194 --> 45:20.718
The ER was a combat zone today.

45:22.154 --> 45:24.112
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.

45:25.853 --> 45:27.550
- Do you know when I'll be
able to pay that hospital bill

45:27.594 --> 45:29.291
from Ray's thing?

45:29.335 --> 45:31.946
It's been a high 120 days and
it could go to collections.

45:33.339 --> 45:36.211
- I'm sorry, I, I
get paid on Thursday.

45:36.255 --> 45:37.952
Can waiting until them?

45:37.996 --> 45:38.823
- I think so.

45:41.303 --> 45:43.088
- How are you?

45:43.131 --> 45:43.871
- [Hanna] I'm fine.

45:47.048 --> 45:49.616
- Hey, I wanted to
ask you if I could,

45:50.660 --> 45:51.531
if we could sit down one day

45:51.574 --> 45:53.576
and talk about this whole thing.

45:54.447 --> 45:55.753
- What thing?

45:55.796 --> 45:57.842
We got several things.

45:57.885 --> 46:00.758
- I mean, this whole
separation thing.

46:00.801 --> 46:02.977
- [scoffs] If you
have time for a chat,

46:03.021 --> 46:05.110
have a chat with
our kids, would you?

46:05.153 --> 46:07.765
Because I can move on, but
these kids, they need a father.

46:08.722 --> 46:10.376
They didn't need all this drama

46:10.419 --> 46:12.726
you put them through so you
could fucking find yourself.

46:14.467 --> 46:15.729
They put on a good face,

46:15.773 --> 46:18.645
but you're gonna
break their hearts.

46:20.038 --> 46:21.169
And I can't afford
to get new ones.

46:22.301 --> 46:22.910
- What?

46:25.565 --> 46:26.435
- I gotta go.

[group chattering]

47:18.487 --> 47:21.360
[Ellis grunts]

47:21.403 --> 47:25.581
- Mr. Ofstein, thank
you for meeting with me.

47:25.625 --> 47:26.713
How's young Michael?

47:27.583 --> 47:28.715
- Fine.

47:28.758 --> 47:29.977
Thank God.

47:30.021 --> 47:31.631
- [Ellis] Yeah,
that's good to hear.

47:31.674 --> 47:35.940
- It was my understanding that
our business had concluded.

47:35.983 --> 47:38.725
- Yes, we seem to have
one small problem.

47:40.640 --> 47:42.424
The man that you
delivered the money to,

47:43.556 --> 47:44.731
he was an FBI agent.

47:46.559 --> 47:48.822
- The money was
delivered to the person

47:48.866 --> 47:50.389
that you sent to collect.

47:50.432 --> 47:52.217
- This is true.

47:52.260 --> 47:55.829
But unfortunately for the both
of us, he was an FBI agent.

47:57.700 --> 47:58.745
- Are we all compromised?

47:58.788 --> 47:59.833
- No, no problem at all.

47:59.877 --> 48:01.269
I took care of everything,

48:01.313 --> 48:03.054
but unfortunately
the money is missing.

48:04.794 --> 48:07.145
So I'm gonna have to ask
you to make another deposit.

48:07.188 --> 48:08.407
- [Mr. Ofstein] How much?

48:08.450 --> 48:09.147
- The full amount.

48:10.583 --> 48:12.802
- What happens on your
end is your problem.

48:12.846 --> 48:14.065
- No, I'm sure young Michael

48:14.108 --> 48:15.805
is worth any amount
of money to you.

48:15.849 --> 48:16.328
- Are you threatening me?

48:16.371 --> 48:17.546
- [Ellis] No.

48:17.590 --> 48:18.678
No, not at all.

48:18.721 --> 48:19.548
- With all due, respect.

48:19.592 --> 48:20.375
- Respect?

48:22.029 --> 48:24.379
Now there's a fine word.

48:24.423 --> 48:25.511
Respect.

48:27.078 --> 48:28.775
Where would young
Michael be without me?

48:28.818 --> 48:30.342
I'll tell you where he'd be.

48:30.385 --> 48:31.996
He'd be dead and in the ground.

48:33.432 --> 48:35.129
And you stand here and
you thank God for that.

48:36.478 --> 48:37.697
How about thanking me?

48:38.480 --> 48:39.351
- Unbelievable.

48:40.787 --> 48:42.658
- [Ellis] What's that?

48:42.702 --> 48:45.748
- Your boss, Mr. Tank, she
said you might try this.

48:45.792 --> 48:47.141
How about we give her a call?

48:54.714 --> 48:56.542
Don't contact me ever again.

49:03.636 --> 49:04.942
- You motherfucker.

- Check this out.

50:24.412 --> 50:25.022
- Yeah.

50:26.632 --> 50:27.850
- So I was going through
all the kidnappings

50:27.894 --> 50:29.678
in the past eight months,

50:29.722 --> 50:31.724
and this just jumped out at me.

50:31.767 --> 50:33.073
Take a look at
all the addresses.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.601
- Okay, it's all
over the city, so?

50:41.560 --> 50:44.432
- Yeah, but they are
all shit neighborhoods.

50:44.476 --> 50:46.260
I noticed most of the
reports were filed by people

50:46.304 --> 50:48.958
with priors, tweakers,
people on SSI,

50:49.002 --> 50:51.352
welfare, foster parents.

records for all children

50:53.789 --> 50:56.140

all over the state.

50:56.183 --> 50:57.706

from the list.

either wealthy people

51:07.542 --> 51:09.762
or people who recently
acquired a large debt

51:09.805 --> 51:12.156
or cashed out their retirement
funds or sold stock.

51:13.983 --> 51:15.550
- And you got warrants for
all these reports, right?

51:15.594 --> 51:16.595
- Listen to me.

51:18.379 --> 51:20.990
I think a lot of these
fucking shitty parents

51:21.034 --> 51:23.167
are selling their
babies for parts.

51:26.648 --> 51:27.867
- Organ trafficking.

51:29.999 --> 51:31.349

the third kind.

Goddamn you.

01:09:00.266 --> 01:09:02.138
What did I tell you
about this kind of shit?

Ugh.

01:09:10.494 --> 01:09:13.018
I apologize for

01:10:02.807 --> 01:10:04.156
I have a little
proposal for you,

01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:07.246
but first you have
to give me your word

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:10.554
that you're gonna drop
this whole situation

01:10:13.426 --> 01:10:14.645
about your wife

01:10:14.688 --> 01:10:16.124

You see, I know how you feel.

I lost a son at 17, that leaves
a deep hole in your heart.

01:10:33.446 --> 01:10:34.230
Great pain.

01:10:35.883 --> 01:10:37.233
But unlike me,

01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:39.713
you have the opportunity
to become a daddy again.

01:10:39.757 --> 01:10:41.280
So you tell me where my money is

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:44.152
and I'll return your
daughter to you.

01:10:48.156 --> 01:10:51.812
Junior, make sure
your phone is charged.

01:10:53.031 --> 01:10:54.380

01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:02.867

- Yes, boss.

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:20.319

we're both victims here.

01:11:23.888 --> 01:11:25.150
Do I have your word?

I'm gonna need you to take
Junior to the Butcher.

I wipe my ass with
fucking henchman.

01:12:25.819 --> 01:12:29.214
Looks like they left you
here to watch the shop,

01:12:29.257 --> 01:12:30.824
which makes you
disposable, puto.

01:24:11.263 --> 01:24:13.570
This is, you know, but
now that I think about it,

01:24:14.919 --> 01:24:16.399
well, part of her
could be in California.

01:24:16.442 --> 01:24:17.965
The other part could
be in the East Coast.

01:24:18.009 --> 01:24:19.228
I don't know.

01:24:19.271 --> 01:24:22.361
And you, you little shit,

01:24:22.405 --> 01:24:24.494
you better fucking
watch every word you say

01:24:24.537 --> 01:24:26.061
'cause we got eyes
on little Ray Ray.

01:24:28.889 --> 01:24:30.891
[chuckles] Yeah.

01:24:30.935 --> 01:24:32.328
It was your old partner's idea.

01:24:32.371 --> 01:24:34.504
I gotta say I thought
it was pretty good.

01:24:34.547 --> 01:24:36.636
'Cause little Ray Ray
will make a good donor.

01:24:38.247 --> 01:24:39.074

01:24:44.992 --> 01:24:46.124
What a fucking prick.

01:24:47.778 --> 01:24:49.214
What a fucking idiot.

01:24:49.258 --> 01:24:50.781
- Oh, come on.

01:24:50.824 --> 01:24:51.782
Don't be too hard on yourself.

01:24:51.825 --> 01:24:53.740
You know I never lose.

01:24:53.784 --> 01:24:55.742
- No, not you.

01:24:55.786 --> 01:24:57.918
I'm not talking about
you, you fucking prick.

01:25:00.443 --> 01:25:01.487
I'm talking about me.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.664
I'm so fucking stupid.

I have no jurisdiction.

01:25:23.944 --> 01:25:24.815
My bad.

01:25:30.951 --> 01:25:32.170

01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.889
So you heard my message, right?

01:28:05.932 --> 01:28:06.759

Yeah, okay.

01:28:45.232 --> 01:28:47.757
- [Daniels] Santiago.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.106

cut back to you immediately.

01:29:06.993 --> 01:29:08.778
Welcome back.

01:29:08.821 --> 01:29:11.215
We go live now to Mike Tilliam,
who's there at the scene.

01:29:11.258 --> 01:29:13.086
Mike tell us, what's
the new information?

01:29:15.567 --> 01:29:17.134
- Here I am with Juan,

01:29:17.177 --> 01:29:20.180
who works at the club where
this horrible murder took place.

01:29:20.224 --> 01:29:21.486
Juan, tell us what happened.

01:29:23.227 --> 01:29:26.709
- I was taking the trash
out and I heard the screams,

01:29:26.752 --> 01:29:29.059
you know, and I
came out the back

01:29:29.102 --> 01:29:32.802
and I saw this big
guy with a hoodie

01:29:32.845 --> 01:29:34.238
on top of this black guy.

01:29:35.631 --> 01:29:38.764
When he looked at
me, I saw his face.

01:29:38.808 --> 01:29:42.899
He was, how you say in English?

01:29:44.466 --> 01:29:48.383

[speaking in Spanish]

01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:56.565
- Juan says, "That the
assailant was very palido,"

01:29:56.608 --> 01:29:59.437
which is Spanish for
someone very pale.

01:29:59.481 --> 01:30:01.961
Police will give us an
update in about an hour.

01:30:02.005 --> 01:30:04.486
Who is this palido man?

01:30:04.529 --> 01:30:08.359
Where is he and why did he
commit this terrible crime

01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:09.404
is anyone's guess.

01:30:10.448 --> 01:30:12.145

have now been identified
as Renata Turner

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:20.066
who had been missing
since Interpol

01:30:20.110 --> 01:30:22.634
raided one of her London
homes three years ago.

01:30:22.678 --> 01:30:26.377
And also professional
assassin Andre Jurgen,

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:30.033
who was a member of the
highly trained German GSG 9.

01:30:30.076 --> 01:30:33.253
Police say the suspect
drove off in a cargo van.

01:30:33.297 --> 01:30:35.342
The story is still
wide and breaking.

01:30:35.386 --> 01:30:36.561
Stay with us for the latest.

01:30:43.525 --> 01:30:44.917

01:30:46.571 --> 01:30:48.486
And who is this palido

01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:50.227

about on the news?

01:30:53.578 --> 01:30:54.536
- Yeah.

01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:58.888
The world is full
of strange things.

01:31:01.107 --> 01:31:02.152
- What did you do?

01:31:06.417 --> 01:31:07.505
What's with the stupid grin?

01:31:10.116 --> 01:31:11.553
- I'm gonna see
Hanna and the boys.

01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:15.513
I, I think I'm
gonna move back in.

01:31:16.732 --> 01:31:17.776
- You're moving back in?

01:31:19.517 --> 01:31:20.518
Okay, well, that's
good for you, man.

01:31:20.562 --> 01:31:21.911
I, that's good.

01:31:21.954 --> 01:31:22.912
I appreciate that.

01:31:22.955 --> 01:31:23.956
That's good.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:24.653
I'm happy for you.

01:31:25.958 --> 01:31:27.612
- Yeah.

01:31:27.656 --> 01:31:31.094
Hey, remember when we found
that Xylazine and the opioids

01:31:31.137 --> 01:31:32.182
in the baby's crib?

01:31:32.225 --> 01:31:33.792
- Sure.
- And you found that gun

01:31:35.054 --> 01:31:35.925
in the serial box.

01:31:38.884 --> 01:31:40.103
You saved my life that day.

01:31:41.365 --> 01:31:43.498
I never thanked you for it.

01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:45.195
- Shut the fuck up
and get outta here.

01:31:48.328 --> 01:31:49.068
Santi.

01:31:50.287 --> 01:31:51.506

Someone's turn.

01:32:19.098 --> 01:32:20.535

01:32:43.427 --> 01:32:45.255
- [Hanna] Oh, seriously?

01:32:47.518 --> 01:32:49.476
- No, no, somebody
needs an address.

01:32:51.957 --> 01:32:53.480
- Oh!

01:32:53.524 --> 01:32:55.091
You have to go, we can go one.

01:32:56.353 --> 01:32:57.615
- No, no.

01:32:57.659 --> 01:32:59.182
You're my priority from now on.

01:32:59.225 --> 01:32:59.922
Yeah.

01:32:59.965 --> 01:33:01.227
- Really?

01:33:01.271 --> 01:33:03.055
Is everything okay?

01:33:03.099 --> 01:33:03.708
- Yeah.

Everything's fantabulous.
