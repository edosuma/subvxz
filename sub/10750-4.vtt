00:30.328 --> 00:33.446
And then Peter said, "Brie...

00:33.995 --> 00:36.172
that's my favourite cheese as well. "

00:36.309 --> 00:38.814
And that was when my bag...
I don't know what happened,

00:39.005 --> 00:40.848
it just kind of split open.

00:41.005 --> 00:42.730
Apples and oranges everywhere.

00:42.949 --> 00:44.616
And we tumbled about.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.311
Yeah. Like a pair of
confused little kittens.

00:47.959 --> 00:50.547
And when Peter had helped me
pick everything up, well...

00:50.782 --> 00:53.781
it just seemed rude not
to give him my number.

00:53.977 --> 00:55.840
Hey, you asked for my number!

00:56.036 --> 00:58.291
Ha, ha, ha, I'm not a slut.

01:04.482 --> 01:07.387
Oh, is that the end of the story?

01:07.641 --> 01:09.445
OK, are we all set for tonight?

01:09.602 --> 01:12.829
Yes. Can you please bring me some wine?

01:20.329 --> 01:25.289
That was some... ah...
Buying the same sort of cheese.

01:26.015 --> 01:28.884
Ah, you made a
20-minute story out of it.

01:29.433 --> 01:31.707
Have you thought of
adapting it into a film?

01:33.623 --> 01:34.857
No.

01:36.074 --> 01:38.172
Well done, you've bagged a normal.

01:38.368 --> 01:39.704
Yes.

01:39.881 --> 01:42.351
He is proper normal, isn't he?

01:42.853 --> 01:44.813
He's taking me to Paris
this weekend.

01:45.049 --> 01:46.578
Ah, Paris.

01:46.797 --> 01:48.150
Have you been to Paris, Moss?

01:48.366 --> 01:51.209
No. I've heard of it.

01:53.266 --> 01:55.172
- Brie?
- Yeah, what?

01:55.525 --> 01:59.427
Nothing. I had you down a
Double-Gloucester-type person.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.996
Yes, I know what you mean.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.737
Oh, it's been ages
since I had a mini-break.

02:07.048 --> 02:10.479
Not only that but all of my friends
are single

02:10.657 --> 02:13.409
and so are all of his
so tonight we're gonna have

02:13.547 --> 02:16.279
a big dinner party and...
It's gonna be brilliant.

02:16.696 --> 02:19.931
Or perhaps
that should be brie-lliant.

02:25.765 --> 02:28.902
D'you know, it is really
important to me that you like him.

02:29.079 --> 02:30.345
No, honestly, it is cos I...

02:30.483 --> 02:31.982
I know we had some rocky beginnings

02:32.130 --> 02:34.051
but I really think of you now,

02:34.189 --> 02:37.102
not just as my workmates,
but as friends.

02:37.676 --> 02:40.327
- Stop it!
- No, I... I mean that.

02:40.507 --> 02:41.559
I really do.

02:41.758 --> 02:43.801
You're really important to me.

02:49.223 --> 02:52.923
Listen, Jen, I've got some bad news,
Colin can't make it tonight.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.649
Oh. But Steve and Jake
are still coming?

02:55.790 --> 02:58.379
Colin was bringing them.
I don't know them well,

02:58.542 --> 03:00.456
it'd be uncomfortable without Colin.

03:00.841 --> 03:03.185
I suppose we'll have to call
the whole thing off.

03:03.943 --> 03:06.118
Unless you can find
three guys to replace them.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.561
Oh... Yeah...

03:20.894 --> 03:23.247
I... Bit of dust.

03:23.910 --> 03:29.086
I'm gonna...
definitely later phone the, um...

03:30.416 --> 03:33.220
Strange... Oh, look at that...

03:38.153 --> 03:40.639
Oh, I can't... I can't...

03:40.853 --> 03:43.394
It's my home, it's my special place,

03:43.571 --> 03:45.781
I can't let you nut-jobs in!

03:47.634 --> 03:50.061
"Nut-jobs"? I hope you're
not including me in that.

03:50.693 --> 03:53.428
Wait a second, we were all
"brilliant friends" a minute ago.

03:53.614 --> 03:57.457
Yes, yes,
I meant friends in a different way,

03:57.889 --> 04:02.766
in a kind of special way that
means you can't come into my home.

04:04.691 --> 04:07.815
Right, so sort of like
not being your friends at all.

04:07.999 --> 04:12.038
Yes, yes, sort of like that
but in a really. special way.

04:12.621 --> 04:14.641
This is your lowest moment, you know.

04:15.556 --> 04:16.930
I think I can live with it.

04:24.043 --> 04:26.117
Roy, can you look at my PC, please?

04:26.313 --> 04:27.921
It keeps freezing.

04:30.930 --> 04:33.839
Did you hear something, Moss?
I thought I heard a noise.

04:34.083 --> 04:38.716
I didn't hear anything, Roy. Unless
it was some kind of stupid mouse.

04:39.383 --> 04:41.814
Yeah, or... or a rat.

04:42.349 --> 04:45.335
Yes, I think it did
sound more like a rat.

04:47.502 --> 04:49.972
I know I was horrible. I'm sorry.

04:51.461 --> 04:52.648
Oh, Richmond...

04:53.718 --> 04:57.866
Oh, Richmond, not you too.
I'm sorry, Richmond...

05:20.464 --> 05:21.758
Hello!

05:25.585 --> 05:26.925
I smell food!

05:31.298 --> 05:32.996
What are you doing?
Don't sit down yet.

05:33.205 --> 05:34.394
Why not? I'm tired.

05:34.570 --> 05:36.921
That's the rules.
We stand around a bit first.

05:37.097 --> 05:38.762
- We have drinks.
- Where's Peter?

05:38.943 --> 05:40.040
In the kitchen.

05:40.334 --> 05:41.569
Can I go to the toilet?

05:42.125 --> 05:44.276
Yes, you may. You don't need to ask.

05:44.885 --> 05:46.492
It's just down there to the left.

05:48.383 --> 05:49.432
There you go.

05:49.593 --> 05:51.411
Ah, thank you, Roy.

05:52.488 --> 05:54.519
How lovely. White wine.

05:54.943 --> 05:57.411
Never seen a wine actually called
"White Wine" before!

05:59.841 --> 06:01.566
Thank you, Roy.
What are you drinking?

06:01.803 --> 06:02.924
Red wine, please.

06:03.104 --> 06:05.066
- Richmond?
- Do you have Absinthe?

06:05.422 --> 06:07.292
- No.
- I only drink Absinthe.

06:07.674 --> 06:10.527
Absinthe, no.
Red wine, white wine, Carlsberg?

06:10.664 --> 06:11.801
Oh, Carlsberg, perfect.

06:12.954 --> 06:14.185
Oh, that was quick.

06:14.365 --> 06:15.483
I washed my hands.

06:16.044 --> 06:17.240
What d'you want to drink?

06:17.730 --> 06:18.887
White Russian.

06:19.192 --> 06:20.600
A white Russian?

06:20.990 --> 06:22.312
Oh, for God's sake!

06:28.456 --> 06:29.691
Documentaries...

06:36.140 --> 06:37.473
Balsamic vinegar...

06:39.964 --> 06:41.396
Conversation...

06:42.313 --> 06:44.273
Oh, apparently one of
Jen's friends is a model.

06:44.450 --> 06:45.865
I bagsy the model.

06:46.747 --> 06:47.845
Er, Jen?

06:48.431 --> 06:50.999
Jen! Um, we've discussed it
as a group

06:51.176 --> 06:54.509
and we think it would be best if
I were to sit beside the model...

06:55.203 --> 06:56.415
because, um,

06:57.355 --> 07:00.456
I would like to ask her how I would
go about becoming a photographer.

07:01.198 --> 07:02.512
Or... or a model.

07:02.845 --> 07:04.002
Paula?

07:04.212 --> 07:05.905
Oh, she'll appreciate that.

07:06.070 --> 07:09.742
She's just had reconstructive
face surgery so she'll be happy

07:09.919 --> 07:11.507
to have someone to talk to.

07:12.153 --> 07:13.202
Right.

07:13.359 --> 07:15.290
It's really brave of her to come out

07:15.427 --> 07:17.368
because she was in
a really bad car accident

07:17.506 --> 07:20.657
so you have to be extra nice to her.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.125
Car accident.

07:23.339 --> 07:24.917
Brilliant. Just my luck.

07:25.373 --> 07:28.334
I'll be honest, the reason
I got you round a bit early

07:28.457 --> 07:30.555
is to go over some ground rules, OK?

07:30.928 --> 07:33.427
If this evening is gonna work
in any way

07:33.810 --> 07:36.901
you need to pretend
to be normal people, yeah?

07:37.228 --> 07:39.915
Keep the conversation about things
that would interest everybody.

07:40.045 --> 07:42.006
You know, nothing about memory
or RAM.

07:42.882 --> 07:46.825
Memory is RAM. Oh, dear.

07:48.628 --> 07:51.648
If you stray into areas I don't
think appropriate, I'll...

07:51.806 --> 07:53.488
I don't know, I'll... I'll cough.

07:53.809 --> 07:56.162
Coughing is the signal.
Richmond, did you hear that?

07:56.339 --> 07:57.339
What?

07:57.515 --> 07:59.501
If Jen coughs we
have to stop talking.

07:59.666 --> 08:00.697
Fine.

08:01.924 --> 08:05.100
Moss, this is important,
I'm sitting you beside Margaret.

08:05.269 --> 08:08.731
Margaret, from her name
I presume she's a lay-dee?

08:09.058 --> 08:10.081
Yes.

08:10.216 --> 08:13.051
She's nice. She got divorced
recently but I should say

08:13.236 --> 08:16.110
when she's had a few drinks
she tends to get a bit...

08:16.482 --> 08:17.607
over excited.

08:17.822 --> 08:20.294
Needs to go to the toilet a lot.
That happens to me.

08:20.491 --> 08:24.021
I try to think of something dry,
like the desert or...

08:24.203 --> 08:25.246
Shredded wheat.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.794
You don't understand.
What I'm saying is she's kind of...

08:29.104 --> 08:31.779
She's kind of on the look out
for a man.

08:32.259 --> 08:33.645
Ah, I see.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.147
What does he look like?

08:36.624 --> 08:38.976
He wouldn't come here -
not with all these people around.

08:39.168 --> 08:40.207
What's this about?

08:40.368 --> 08:41.839
Jen's friend has got a stalker.

08:42.077 --> 08:43.164
Cool.

08:43.309 --> 08:45.058
Oh, God,
maybe I could just kill myself.

08:47.479 --> 08:50.185
Here they are, so look normal.

08:53.151 --> 08:55.033
Look more normal, more normal.

08:58.697 --> 09:00.010
Relax.

09:03.205 --> 09:04.447
Forget it!

09:06.716 --> 09:08.500
Hello. Come in.

09:10.521 --> 09:12.364
Hello. I'm Roy.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.346
I'm sorry about the accident.

09:16.304 --> 09:17.461
Hello.

09:19.578 --> 09:20.807
This is Paula.

09:21.796 --> 09:23.737
Yep, I know.

09:24.633 --> 09:26.286
I was... talking to her.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.562
Did you think I was talking to you?

09:29.155 --> 09:30.253
This is Jessica.

09:31.214 --> 09:32.429
Hello, everybody.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.500
Oh, my God. Social situations.

09:37.867 --> 09:39.572
Oh, bloody hell,
I think this is my one.

09:39.969 --> 09:41.557
These are my workmates.

09:41.753 --> 09:43.204
They're not my usual friends.

09:43.357 --> 09:45.474
I work with them,
they're my workmates.

09:45.631 --> 09:51.167
Oh, yes.
IT department does not compute.

09:52.396 --> 09:53.483
Oh, my God!

09:56.190 --> 09:57.366
You must be Roy.

09:57.511 --> 09:58.634
Yep.

10:00.206 --> 10:01.515
Hello, everybody.

10:02.159 --> 10:05.936
I have had a few drinks already so
no-one take advantage of me.

10:06.420 --> 10:07.800
Oh, go on then!

10:25.023 --> 10:26.866
I was very pleased
with my last campaign.

10:27.468 --> 10:29.154
I just started running it today.

10:34.018 --> 10:35.188
That's you!

10:36.419 --> 10:37.764
OK...

10:38.833 --> 10:40.068
Yeah...

10:41.389 --> 10:46.115
So... how bad was the accident?

10:46.366 --> 10:49.739
Well, a motorbike jumped the lights
and so I swerved into a lamppost.

10:49.994 --> 10:52.248
The airbag didn't deploy
so I hit the dashboard.

10:52.445 --> 10:54.775
- With your facial area.
- I hit it full in the face.

10:55.106 --> 10:56.577
Of course you did!

10:57.764 --> 10:59.015
Speed?

10:59.470 --> 11:00.862
I was doing about 75.

11:00.999 --> 11:02.214
Cor!

11:03.039 --> 11:04.568
That's fast! That's...

11:06.215 --> 11:08.117
When you regained consciousness,

11:08.733 --> 11:13.438
did you look in the mirror and think,
"Oh, God, my face is ruined"?

11:14.216 --> 11:16.451
They didn't let me see
my face after the accident.

11:18.092 --> 11:19.287
Ah.

11:19.797 --> 11:20.993
I see.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.043
They said it might not be
as symmetrical as it once had been,

11:24.246 --> 11:26.219
but symmetry isn't everything.

11:26.376 --> 11:28.041
Yeah... I like symmetry.

11:29.269 --> 11:33.230
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it,
I'm trying to eat my dinner!

11:36.030 --> 11:41.675
Gosh. Ooh, oh dear, look at us
having a conversation. Yikes!

11:43.009 --> 11:46.322
Getting to know you,
getting to know all about you!

11:47.503 --> 11:51.111
Mm, eating! Ooh, hello, how are you?

11:51.370 --> 11:53.488
"Ooh, I'm a fish.
Help, I'm being eaten!"

12:01.173 --> 12:04.624
You know when you laugh,
I can see the outline of your skull.

12:06.405 --> 12:07.954
You have a beautiful skull.

12:15.066 --> 12:17.450
OK...

12:18.476 --> 12:19.621
So the surgeon...

12:19.826 --> 12:21.049
- Yeah?
- Good man?

12:21.176 --> 12:22.738
Very. He did his own nose.

12:24.304 --> 12:26.829
And did you meet him
before the operation?

12:27.006 --> 12:28.937
Yeah, he ran me through it.
He was really nice.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.279
Confident?

12:30.437 --> 12:31.790
Why are you so interested?

12:33.398 --> 12:39.608
My... mother is... thinking
of having a breast augmentation.

12:39.762 --> 12:40.762
I see.

12:40.909 --> 12:43.156
Yeah. Always wanted them bigger!

12:43.433 --> 12:46.413
But I promised I'd get them
for her birthday.

12:47.978 --> 12:49.221
Her 60th is coming up.

12:49.382 --> 12:50.509
Right.

12:52.568 --> 12:56.411
Well, I think a round of applause
is justified for that dinner.

13:00.004 --> 13:02.545
Yes, and thanks, Peter,
for making it.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.115
So, who's for dessert?

13:06.482 --> 13:07.602
Isn't this dessert?

13:07.756 --> 13:09.227
No, that's tartare sauce.

13:10.871 --> 13:12.322
- Can I have some dessert?
- Yeah.

13:12.479 --> 13:15.479
I'll have the tartare sauce.
Stop it! Stop it!

13:15.644 --> 13:17.114
Look how ticklish he is!

13:17.254 --> 13:18.902
- Stop it!
- Come on!

13:21.543 --> 13:23.504
Jen, can you do something
about that woman?

13:23.731 --> 13:25.292
- I warned you about her.
- When?

13:25.443 --> 13:27.051
I spent ten minutes
trying to warn you.

13:27.185 --> 13:28.506
I can see why she's divorced.

13:28.691 --> 13:29.888
She's very divorceable.

13:30.044 --> 13:32.574
You can't wait to take her to court
to get rid of her!

13:32.708 --> 13:34.220
What are you doing?

13:34.557 --> 13:37.161
Well, not that
it's any of your business,

13:37.299 --> 13:39.436
but I was planning
to have a little poo.

13:40.969 --> 13:43.148
No, no, I mean with Paula.

13:43.369 --> 13:46.239
You keep asking her all those
questions about her accident.

13:46.382 --> 13:47.402
I'm interested!

13:47.559 --> 13:49.613
You're wondering
what state her face is in.

13:49.785 --> 13:50.986
Was that obvious?

13:51.314 --> 13:52.833
I suppose I better go back in there

13:52.975 --> 13:54.681
and see what Judy Finnegan's up to!

13:54.985 --> 13:57.808
If this keeps on going on
I will divorce her.

13:58.043 --> 13:59.279
You're not married to her.

14:00.243 --> 14:02.271
No, I suppose...
I suppose I'm not.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.236
Come on, behave yourselves.

14:04.457 --> 14:06.633
There's still a chance
to save this thing.

14:07.076 --> 14:08.762
Oh... why...

14:21.402 --> 14:22.970
Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.844
I said, "Do you think you'd die
if you drank wee?"

14:33.318 --> 14:35.230
I don't know, but it's
a bloody good question.

14:35.498 --> 14:38.978
Here's a question - who here
would eat a spider? I would.

14:39.713 --> 14:43.693
I ate an eel in New York but I
was on stage so it doesn't count.

14:44.104 --> 14:47.147
Ah, New York, the city of apples.

14:48.372 --> 14:51.213
Peter, I got that link
for the Firefox extension.

14:51.333 --> 14:53.038
What's your e-mail address?

14:53.169 --> 14:54.988
- Do you have a pen?
- I'm recording.

14:55.426 --> 14:57.622
It's filepeter@hotmail. com.

14:58.319 --> 15:00.328
"Filepeter"? And why "filepeter"?

15:00.574 --> 15:02.487
Well, File is my second name.

15:02.884 --> 15:05.080
Oh, right, I see. Peter File.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.609
Who's a paedophile?

15:07.942 --> 15:10.472
No, no, his name is Peter File.

15:10.807 --> 15:12.203
His name is paedophile?

15:12.463 --> 15:14.218
Don't say it like that!

15:15.326 --> 15:16.817
It sounds like "paedophile".

15:16.993 --> 15:18.130
That what he just said.

15:18.258 --> 15:19.960
No. "Peter File".

15:20.369 --> 15:22.665
- Paedo File?
- PETER... File.

15:23.119 --> 15:25.053
- Who's a paedophile?
- No-one.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.349
Right.
It just sounds like "paedophile".

15:27.477 --> 15:28.747
No, no, it doesn't.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.660
Does a bit. "Peter File. "

15:30.833 --> 15:32.064
"Peter File"? It does.

15:36.014 --> 15:37.543
Yes, I suppose it does!

15:40.254 --> 15:42.371
I hadn't noticed so...

15:43.487 --> 15:45.527
It doesn't worry you, does it?

15:45.882 --> 15:47.123
No, no.

15:48.853 --> 15:50.482
Of course it doesn't.

15:52.255 --> 15:55.783
They say "PED-o-phile" in America.
Maybe you should move to America!

15:55.921 --> 15:57.705
He's not moving to America!

16:01.167 --> 16:02.718
<i>Raiders Of The Lost Ark?</i>

16:05.829 --> 16:07.113
<i>Circle Of Friends?</i>

16:07.427 --> 16:08.545
It's so obvious!

16:08.702 --> 16:09.741
No speaking!

16:09.905 --> 16:11.556
I've been standing here
for ten minutes.

16:11.713 --> 16:12.983
Where's Richmond and Jessica?

16:13.150 --> 16:14.565
<i>Pirates Of The Caribbean!</i>

16:15.123 --> 16:16.722
How was that
<i>Pirates Of The Caribbean?</i>

16:16.885 --> 16:18.663
I don't know
but it was a great movie!

16:18.908 --> 16:20.779
Johnny Depp, what a revelation!

16:21.590 --> 16:22.991
It's <i>Crash</i>!

16:23.166 --> 16:24.832
It's very obviously <i>Crash</i>!

16:24.998 --> 16:27.652
Here's a car crashing
into another car,

16:27.835 --> 16:31.108
there's people screaming
and... oh, Paula!

16:33.207 --> 16:35.593
Let's play Spin The Bottle!

16:35.758 --> 16:36.973
Oh, for God's sake!

16:37.118 --> 16:38.487
- Oh, what?
- Nothing.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.141
Oh, I'm embarrassing him!

16:40.270 --> 16:41.652
You're making a fool of yourself!

16:41.819 --> 16:43.528
He's a delicate flower.

16:43.671 --> 16:44.903
You are drunk!

16:45.078 --> 16:47.254
If you paid more attention to me...

16:47.432 --> 16:49.051
Oh, tell me, Margaret, tell us all,

16:49.205 --> 16:51.911
how could we pay
any more attention to you?

16:52.092 --> 16:53.275
Oh, you've changed.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.251
You're not the same man I liked
when I came into the party.

16:57.070 --> 16:58.678
We've all changed, Margaret.

16:59.550 --> 17:01.001
We all have.

17:15.356 --> 17:17.696
Oh, for God's sake!

17:19.829 --> 17:21.761
Night, Jen.
Roy's gonna walk me home.

17:21.967 --> 17:23.183
Oh, lovely.

17:23.319 --> 17:24.972
You know, it's just
in case any kind of

17:25.133 --> 17:27.009
elephant man mob situation kicks off.

17:30.881 --> 17:32.972
Sorry about Margaret,
it won't happen again.

17:33.183 --> 17:35.136
Oh, fiddly-do.

17:35.443 --> 17:37.178
Come on, let's get you home.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.114
- Goodbye, Jen.
- Bye, Jen.

17:42.599 --> 17:43.781
Bye.

17:44.507 --> 17:45.912
Oh, my God!

17:53.472 --> 17:56.074
Nightmare!
An absolute nightmare.

17:56.195 --> 17:57.274
What d'you mean?

17:57.459 --> 18:00.685
Well, I always have this theory
that if you let your work life

18:00.830 --> 18:04.985
mix with your personal life,
then somehow something will go wrong.

18:05.494 --> 18:06.844
But nothing has, has it?

18:07.097 --> 18:08.430
I think it all went rather well.

18:08.633 --> 18:09.829
Everyone seemed to pair off.

18:09.986 --> 18:11.836
It's what you want
from an evening like this.

18:11.974 --> 18:13.248
I suppose so.

18:13.766 --> 18:15.421
You're going to have
to face the fact

18:15.666 --> 18:18.852
you run a very successful
dinner party, Jen Barber.

18:19.570 --> 18:22.568
You didn't do too badly yourself,
"paedophile".

18:28.631 --> 18:29.846
Thanks for walking me home.

18:30.023 --> 18:31.474
That's OK. Goodbye.

18:32.050 --> 18:33.461
Woah!

18:38.448 --> 18:39.985
- You live here?!
- Yeah.

18:42.305 --> 18:43.764
That's a big telly.

18:45.011 --> 18:48.050
Oh, and all the consoles.
You've got all of the consoles.

18:48.722 --> 18:50.036
Why d'you have all the consoles?

18:50.173 --> 18:52.899
I'd hate it if a game came out
on one and I couldn't play it

18:53.477 --> 18:55.446
so it's better to get them all.
Don't you think?

18:55.572 --> 18:56.622
I do think.

19:00.077 --> 19:01.868
And a man doesn't live here?

19:02.188 --> 19:03.345
No, just me.

19:05.988 --> 19:07.916
Woah, gee!

19:10.696 --> 19:11.955
I'm gonna gamble.

19:12.195 --> 19:13.422
What?

19:14.801 --> 19:17.106
Would you like to come
for a drink some time?

19:17.274 --> 19:19.658
- Oh.
- You know, like a date?

19:19.854 --> 19:20.905
What the hell?

19:21.065 --> 19:22.462
Roy, I'm very flattered...

19:22.654 --> 19:24.915
Good. Of course you are. Thursday?

19:25.092 --> 19:26.504
...But you're not my type.

19:27.990 --> 19:29.018
What?

19:29.146 --> 19:30.540
I mean physically.

19:31.425 --> 19:32.673
Physically?

19:34.580 --> 19:35.932
Hello.

19:37.295 --> 19:38.787
I think I can do better.

19:43.420 --> 19:44.695
OK.

19:55.496 --> 19:57.019
- Can I have a lend of this?
- No.

20:04.701 --> 20:06.367
Listen... Jen.

20:07.723 --> 20:10.822
When we get back, maybe we should
think about, I don't know,

20:11.530 --> 20:14.404
moving your stuff over to my place,
vice versa, I don't mind but...

20:15.594 --> 20:17.770
I think it's time we moved
onto the next level,

20:18.321 --> 20:20.968
- don't you?
Yes. Yes, definitely.

20:22.056 --> 20:23.252
Great.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.129
<i>If there is a</i>
<i>Peter File in the terminal building</i>

20:26.286 --> 20:28.382
<i>could he please make his way to Gate 24?</i>

20:28.768 --> 20:30.630
<i>We are looking for a Peter File. </i>

20:31.524 --> 20:33.446
24... we're at the wrong gate!

20:34.618 --> 20:37.285
<i>Could Peter File please make himself
known to ground staff?</i>

20:37.814 --> 20:39.059
I'm Peter File!

20:39.216 --> 20:41.238
<i>We are looking for a Peter File. </i>

20:41.476 --> 20:42.750
I'm Peter File!

20:42.966 --> 20:44.544
Wait here! I'm Peter File!

20:44.732 --> 20:47.313
Hold on! Come on, Jen.
I'm Peter File!

20:47.831 --> 20:49.419
I'm Peter File!

20:49.959 --> 20:52.842
It's "Peter File" not "paedophile".

20:58.924 --> 21:00.237
Taxi!

21:09.839 --> 21:12.113
It's very loud,
mind if I turn it down?

21:12.333 --> 21:14.240
I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that!

21:19.024 --> 21:22.631
Oh, dear, look at me,
having an orgasm!
