WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:02.503
.

00:02.536 --> 00:03.304
- OKAY, HERE'S THE TEXT
FOR YOUR SPEECH.

00:04.372 --> 00:05.106
I ADDED A FEW MORE JOKES,

00:05.139 --> 00:07.208
SLAMMING EAGLETON
AT THE END.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.342
- MMM.
THAT'S THE SEXIEST THING

00:08.376 --> 00:09.677
YOU'VE EVER SAID TO ME.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.345
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE
ON MY TEAM.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.513
- ARE YOU SURE YOU WANNA
ATTACK 'EM

00:12.546 --> 00:13.681
AT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE?

00:13.714 --> 00:14.748
IT'S A FRIENDLY WAGER

00:14.782 --> 00:16.650
ON A HIGH SCHOOL
BASKETBALL GAME.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.286
- I'M LOSING
THE RECALL ELECTION, BEN.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.587
SLAMMING EAGLETON
IS THE EASIEST WAY

00:19.620 --> 00:21.055
TO SCORE SOME POINTS.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.823
LOOK. AM I PROUD OF IT?
YES.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.325
BECAUSE EAGLETON SUCKS.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.526
BUT IS IT
THE CLASSIEST MOVE?

00:25.559 --> 00:27.328
YES,
BECAUSE EAGLETON SUCKS.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.262
WOULD I DO IT AGAIN?

00:28.296 --> 00:30.164
YES,
BECAUSE EAGLETON SUCKS.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.365
THIS YEAR, WE GET TO HOST

00:31.399 --> 00:33.567
THE PAWNEE-EAGLETON
TIP-OFF CLASSIC.

00:33.601 --> 00:37.171
THAT AWFUL HUMAN BEING
IS INGRID DE FOREST.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.140
SHE'S A CITY COUNCILOR
FROM EAGLETON.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.741
SHE THINKS SHE'S SO GREAT
BECAUSE SHE WON

00:40.774 --> 00:42.710
THE MISS INDIANA
BEAUTY PAGEANT.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.379
LAST YEAR.
WHILE SHE WAS IN OFFICE.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.281
AND PREGNANT.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.582
AS ALWAYS,
WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE

00:48.616 --> 00:50.351
A FRIENDLY WAGER
WITH EAGLETON.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.153
IF YOU BEAT US THIS YEAR,

00:52.186 --> 00:54.355
WE WILL GIVE YOU
A BASKET OF APPLES

00:54.388 --> 00:55.789
FROM OUR PAWNEE ORCHARD.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.358
- EW, PESTICIDE.
YUCK.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.360
- OH, NO, THESE
ARE PESTICIDE-FREE.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.861
I ATE ONE OF THESE
FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING,

01:00.894 --> 01:01.862
AND I FOUND A WORM IN IT.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.799
SO, I BET SOMEBODY FEELS
PRETTY STUPID RIGHT NOW.

01:05.833 --> 01:09.103
- WELL, LESLIE, I THINK
WE HAD SIMILAR IDEAS.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.605
IF YOU WIN,
EAGLETON WILL GIVE YOU

01:11.639 --> 01:13.407
THIS BASKET OF ORANGES.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.475
[chuckles]

01:14.508 --> 01:15.809
OF COURSE,
IT'S SILLY TO COMPARE

01:15.843 --> 01:18.512
APPLES AND ORANGES,
BUT WHAT THE HECK.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.214
THESE ARE MADE
OF SWAROVSKI CRYSTAL,

01:20.248 --> 01:22.350
AND THEY'RE WORTH $700,000.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.618
- LESLIE,
YOU'RE DOWN 15 POINTS

01:24.652 --> 01:26.587
IN THE LATEST POLL
FOR THE RECALL ELECTION.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.456
WHAT CAN YOU DO
TO MAKE UP THE DEFICIT?

01:28.489 --> 01:30.258
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'D DO
IF I WAS AN EAGLETONIAN.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.759
I'D POP A XANAX

01:31.792 --> 01:33.561
AND ASK MY BUTLER
TO HELP ME OUT.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.330
[laughter]

01:36.364 --> 01:37.665
I MEAN, I'M NOT SAYING
THAT EAGLETONIANS

01:37.698 --> 01:38.799
ARE OUT OF TOUCH.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.434
BUT WHEN YOU TELL 'EM
IT'S TIME

01:40.468 --> 01:41.869
TO CHANGE THEIR OIL,
THEY ASK,

01:41.902 --> 01:43.904
"EXTRA VIRGIN
OR WHITE TRUFFLE?"

01:43.937 --> 01:45.306
[laughter]

01:45.339 --> 01:46.707
THANKS, GUYS.
I'LL SEE YA AT THE GAME.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.376
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE AN EAGLETONIAN,

01:48.409 --> 01:49.877
AND THEN YOU'LL BE TOO BUSY
POLISHING YOUR MONOCLE

01:49.910 --> 01:51.512
AT THE CAVIAR STORE.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.214
KNOPE OUT.
[microphone feedback]

01:53.247 --> 01:54.282
[laughter]

01:54.315 --> 01:55.416
YEAH.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.419
[triumphant music]

01:58.452 --> 02:06.527
*

02:15.769 --> 02:18.772
- WHO OR WHAT
IS PENNY SAVER?

02:18.806 --> 02:21.309
- IT'S A FREE CIRCULAR
WITH A BUNCH OF COUPONS IN IT.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.477
- THIS WAS SENT
TO RON SWANSON

02:23.511 --> 02:24.845
AT DIANE'S ADDRESS,

02:24.878 --> 02:27.348
WHERE I'VE LIVED
FOR LESS THAN A MONTH.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.250
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

02:29.283 --> 02:31.585
THIS IS AN EXTREME INVASION
OF PRIVACY.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.522
THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.258
MY FAMILY HAS HAD
A SINGLE P.O. BOX

02:37.291 --> 02:38.792
FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.295
WE ONLY EVER SUBSCRIBE
TO TWO MAGAZINES,

02:41.329 --> 02:44.198
READER'S DIGEST
AND EBONY.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.933
EBONY WAS DUE
TO A CLERICAL ERROR,

02:45.966 --> 02:49.303
BUT IT ENDED UP BEING
AN INTERESTING YEAR OF READING.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.771
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS
WAS DELIVERED TO ME,

02:50.804 --> 02:52.673
BUT IT CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

02:52.706 --> 02:53.974
HOW CAN I STOP IT?

02:54.007 --> 02:56.477
- MM. DONNA IS GREAT
WITH THIS SORT OF THING.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.612
SHE GOT ME OFF THE
WILLIAMS-SONOMA MAILING LIST,

02:58.646 --> 03:00.248
BUT THEN I JUST
SIGNED BACK UP AGAIN.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.549
HOOKED ON THEIR OVEN MITTS.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.217
I NEED MY MITTS
ON THOSE MITTS.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.718
- LET ME KNOW THE SECOND
DONNA RETURNS.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.986
- ACCORDING TO
HER TWITTER FEED,

03:06.019 --> 03:07.788
SHE GOT COFFEE
FIVE MINUTES AGO.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.690
WAIT, NOT SHE'S USTREAMING
HER WALK BACK.

03:09.723 --> 03:14.395
SHE SHOULD BE HERE
IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.230
both: HEY, HEY.

03:16.264 --> 03:19.400
- HASHTAG QUEST FOR COFFEE,
BLOWIN' UP MY TIMELINE.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.701
YOU GET MY SNAPCHAT
ABOUT IT?

03:20.734 --> 03:22.736
- NO.
- WHAT?

03:22.770 --> 03:25.239
- THERE IT IS.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.808
- HEY, YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?
- I DID.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.710
THINK FAST.
- OH, MY GOD.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.012
HEY, DR. BUTTONS--

03:32.045 --> 03:33.881
I MEAN, MY OLD CALCULATOR.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.015
IT DOESN'T HAVE A NAME.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.016
WHY DID YOU
THROW THIS AT ME?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.385
- I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH OUR OLD BOSS

03:37.418 --> 03:38.319
FROM INDIANAPOLIS,

03:38.352 --> 03:39.820
AND APPARENTLY THERE MAY BE
SOME SORT OF

03:39.853 --> 03:41.722
A BUDGET PROBLEM
IN EAGLETON.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.258
HE ASKED
IF MAYBE YOU AND I

03:44.292 --> 03:47.528
WOULDN'T HAVE A LOOK.
YOU IN?

03:47.561 --> 03:49.930
- BUTCH COUNT-SIDY
AND THE SUM-DANCE KID,

03:49.963 --> 03:51.932
TOGETHER AGAIN.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.004
both: HMM.
- AUDITING BROS!

03:57.037 --> 04:00.841
- YEAH, AND AUDITING SISTAH.
LET'S DO THIS.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.276
- OH, YOU'RE COMING?

04:02.310 --> 04:03.311
- IF THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH EAGLETON,

04:03.344 --> 04:04.345
I WANNA BE THERE.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.679
THAT'S LIKE
A DREAM COME TRUE.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.048
BESIDES, I HAVE A NEW ROUTINE
I'M WORKING ON.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.683
KIND OF LIKE
A JEFF FOXWORTHY-TYPE THING,

04:09.717 --> 04:10.951
BUT ABOUT EAGLETON.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.386
[Southern accent]
IF YOU MAKE YOUR OMELET

04:12.420 --> 04:14.622
OUT OF FABERGE EGGS,

04:14.655 --> 04:17.491
YOU JUST MIGHT...
both: BE AN EAGLETONIAN.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.760
- YIPPEE! ROAD TRIP!

04:19.793 --> 04:21.362
WHO'S EXCITED TO GO
TO BLOOMINGTON?

04:21.394 --> 04:22.763
- IS THAT WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA SIT?

04:22.796 --> 04:24.832
- I'M DRIVING.
WHERE ELSE WOULD I SIT?

04:24.865 --> 04:25.933
- TRUNK.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.935
- I HELPED APRIL GET
INTO VET SCHOOL IN BLOOMINGTON

04:27.968 --> 04:29.403
AND TODAY'S HER ORIENTATION,

04:29.437 --> 04:31.339
SO WE'RE TAKING
A LITTLE ROAD TRIP.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.606
WHILE I'M THERE,
I'M ALSO GONNA PICK UP

04:32.640 --> 04:34.074
AN ORGANIC BABY BLANKET.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.310
I WOULD GET ONE IN PAWNEE,
BUT FUN FACT--

04:36.344 --> 04:39.647
OUR ONLY BABY STORE IS ATTACHED
TO A CHEMICAL REFINERY.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.783
I MADE A SPECIAL ROAD TRIP
MIX CD FOR US.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.819
I HOPE YOU LIKE TORI AMOS.
- OH, COOL.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.425
- IT REALLY IS A PLEASURE
TO SEE YOU

04:51.459 --> 04:52.726
IN THIS CONTEXT, INGRID.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.794
SAY CHEESE.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.996
DAMN IT.
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.865
- CAN YOU GIVE US
A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION

04:57.898 --> 04:59.633
SURROUNDING THE DEFICITS
THAT YOU'RE RUNNING THIS YEAR?

04:59.667 --> 05:00.968
- OOH, GOSH.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.671
WE DON'T REALLY LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT

05:03.704 --> 05:04.872
[whispers]
MONEY.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.540
WE FIND A LITTLE GAUCHE.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.442
- THIS IS A BUDGET MEETING.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.910
- WELL, MOST OF OUR FILES
ARE IN THESE BOXES

05:09.943 --> 05:10.978
IF YOU REALLY WANNA
TAKE A LOOK

05:11.011 --> 05:12.913
AT HOW MUCH
THAT WE'VE SPENT.

05:12.946 --> 05:13.947
- WHY DON'T WE JUST DIG IN

05:13.981 --> 05:15.048
AND SEE WHAT
WE'RE UP AGAINST?

05:15.082 --> 05:16.550
- YES. AND THANK YOU.

05:16.584 --> 05:19.420
WE REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR HELP.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.422
- ARE YOU TIPPING ME?

05:21.455 --> 05:24.425
- IS THAT 100...EUROS?

05:24.458 --> 05:27.361
- PEOPLE OUGHT TO HAVE
THE RIGHT TO BE LEFT ALONE.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.563
I WANNA GET COMPLETELY
OFF THE GRID.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.831
- THAT'S CRAZY TALK.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.366
I LIVE FOR THE GRID.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.435
IT'S WHERE I MEET
40% OF MY JUMP-OFFS.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.669
- AND IF YOU'RE
OFF THE GRID,

05:35.703 --> 05:36.837
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
POST PHOTOS

05:36.870 --> 05:38.071
OF THE DOPE FOOD
AT RESTAURANTS YOU'RE AT

05:38.105 --> 05:39.940
AND ALL THE COOL PLACES
YOU'RE STUNTIN' IN?

05:39.973 --> 05:40.874
- FOOD IS FOR EATING.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.611
PLACES ARE FOR BEING.
END OF DISCUSSION.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.413
- DON'T LEAVE THE GRID, RON.
THE GRID IS THE BEST.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.715
- IF ANYTHING, YOU NEED
TO GET MORE ON THE GRID.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.551
both: GRID, GRID, GRID,
GRID, GRID, GRID, GRID--

05:50.584 --> 05:51.752
- IF YOU HELP ME
GET OFF THE GRID,

05:51.785 --> 05:53.721
I WILL LET BOTH OF YOU
GO HOME EARLY.

05:53.754 --> 05:58.025
both: NO GRID, NO GRID,
NO GRID, NO GRID.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.393
- ALL RIGHT, SO YOU HAVE

05:59.427 --> 06:00.594
EVERYTHING YOU NEED
FOR ORIENTATION?

06:00.628 --> 06:02.830
- YEAH, AN EMPTY SPRITE CAN,

06:02.863 --> 06:05.399
AN OLD MAN'S FINGERNAIL
IN MY POCKET,

06:05.433 --> 06:07.635
AND A PICTURE
OF PATRICK EWING

06:07.668 --> 06:08.669
ON A ROLLER COASTER.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.137
I'M ALL SET.
- GREAT.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.406
HI. MY FRIEND HERE
IS ENROLLING

06:12.440 --> 06:13.674
IN THE VET SCHOOL
NEXT MONTH,

06:13.707 --> 06:15.443
AND SHE WOULD LIKE
TO BE SHOWN AROUND.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.411
- TOTALLY, HAPPY TO.
I'M LAURA.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.613
- I'M APRIL LUDGATE KEVORKIAN.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.181
- SO YOU GO WITH LAURA,
WHO SEEMS REALLY NICE

06:21.214 --> 06:23.116
AND DOES NOT DESERVE
TO BE TORTURED.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.685
AND I WILL COME
MEET UP WITH YOU

06:24.718 --> 06:26.487
AFTER I FINISH
AT THE BABY STORE.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.088
- SURE YOU WANNA
LEAVE ME HERE WITH HER?

06:28.121 --> 06:29.523
WHAT IF I'M A MURDERER?

06:29.557 --> 06:31.925
- [laughs]
OH, THAT'S FUNNY.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.127
- THIS IS WORSE
THAN I COULD'VE IMAGINED.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.530
THEIR DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO
IS RIDONKULOUS.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.599
- [laughs]
WHAT A HILARIOUS WORD.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.167
IT REMINDS ME
OF A RIDICULOUS DONKEY.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.469
HE'S THE BEST.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.736
- WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
FOR THEM?

06:42.770 --> 06:44.137
- THEY WERE IN
FINANCIAL TROUBLE

06:44.171 --> 06:46.073
A FEW YEARS AGO,
LIKE PAWNEE WAS,

06:46.106 --> 06:49.677
BUT THEIR GOVERNMENT
JUST KEPT BORROWING MONEY.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.011
EAGLETON IS ON THE BRINK

06:51.044 --> 06:53.146
OF AN EPIC FINANCIAL DISASTER.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.414
- AHH.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.118
NOW THAT IS THE SEXIEST THING
YOU'VE EVER SAID TO ME.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.086
- REALLY, THAT?

06:59.119 --> 07:01.522
- THIS IS GONNA HAND ME
THE RECALL ELECTION.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.223
I SAVED PAWNEE
FROM BANKRUPTCY.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.225
NOW I GET TO REMIND PEOPLE
OF THAT FACT

07:05.258 --> 07:07.027
AS WE WATCH
OUR WORST ENEMY

07:07.060 --> 07:08.996
COLLAPSE INTO BANKRUPTCY.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.198
PLUS, GUESS WHAT I GET
TO DO AFTER THE GAME NOW.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.132
YOU PRETEND YOU'RE INGRID.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.133
LET'S PRETEND THIS BOX

07:13.166 --> 07:15.135
IS THE BASKET OF APPLES
I BET THEM ON THE GAME.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.103
- I SEE WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.771
- NO, YOU DON'T.
- YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME

07:17.805 --> 07:19.239
IF I LIKE APPLES--
- DO YOU LIKE APPLES?

07:19.272 --> 07:20.974
- WE JUST WATCHED THIS MOVIE
TWO NIGHTS AGO, SO--

07:21.008 --> 07:22.142
- DO YOU LIKE APPLES?
- I DON'T WANNA DO THIS.

07:26.146 --> 07:26.547
.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.047
- PAUL, IF YOU EVER SEE

07:27.948 --> 07:28.982
ANOTHER ONE OF THESE
WITH MY NAME ON IT,

07:29.016 --> 07:30.884
I WANT YOU TO DRIVE
INTO THE WOODS AND BURY IT.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.753
- I DON'T DECIDE
WHO GETS MAIL, SIR.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.721
I JUST DELIVER IT.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.188
- PASSING THE BUCK--

07:35.222 --> 07:37.925
THE LAST REFUGE OF THE COWARDLY
AND BLACK-HEARTED.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.728
- THAT SEEMS HARSH.
- GET OUT.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.496
- WE GOT RID
OF YOUR CELL PHONE.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.832
THIS IS YOUR LAST
CREDIT CARD.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.000
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT ME
TO CUT UP THIS CARD?

07:47.034 --> 07:48.702
IT GETS YOU INTO
THE PARKING GARAGE.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.037
- I'LL BE TAKING THE BUS NOW,

07:50.070 --> 07:51.972
AND I'LL BE PAYING IN CASH.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.675
WHAT OTHER TRACES OF ME
EXIST IN THE WORLD?

07:54.708 --> 07:56.043
THINK, PEOPLE.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.811
- ISN'T THERE A PHOTO OF YOU
UP AT JJ'S DINER,

07:57.845 --> 07:59.580
FROM THAT TIME WHEN YOU--
AAH!

07:59.613 --> 08:00.748
- COME ON, TOM!

08:00.781 --> 08:02.816
- THIS PLACE IS UNBELIEVABLE.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.785
IT HAS EVERYTHING I NEED:

08:04.818 --> 08:07.588
VIDEO MONITORS,
LEAD-FREE PACIFIERS.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.289
THESE ARE THE FIRST BIBS
I'VE EVER SEEN

08:09.322 --> 08:11.725
WITHOUT DALE EARNHARDT JR.'S
FACE ON THEM.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.794
- REALLY?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.596
- APRIL?

08:15.629 --> 08:16.764
EXCUSE ME, SORRY.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.099
APRIL, WHY AREN'T YOU
AT ORIENTATION?

08:19.132 --> 08:20.300
- UM, I WAS AT ORIENTATION,

08:20.333 --> 08:21.769
BUT IT WAS LAME,
SO I LEFT.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.538
AND THEN I KEPT WALKING,
AND NOW HERE I AM.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.106
- WE ARE GOING BACK THERE
RIGHT NOW, YOUNG LADY.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.141
- MM-MM.
- COME ON.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.943
- GOD, GET OFF ME,
STRANGER.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.745
- I'M SO SORRY WE'RE LATE.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.246
WE CAME FROM
OUR BANKRUPTCY BRUNCH.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.948
AND MICHAEL BUBLE PLAYED,
BUT HE RAN A LITTLE LONG.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.183
- I LOVE MICHAEL BUBLE.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.653
- WAS A BANKRUPTCY BRUNCH
THE BEST IDEA?

08:39.687 --> 08:40.754
- SURE, LET'S NOT
HAVE BRUNCH...

08:40.788 --> 08:42.089
[chuckles]
LIKE ANIMALS.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.324
- WELL, UM, SOME OF
THESE EXPENDITURES

08:44.357 --> 08:46.159
ARE QUESTIONABLE.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.262
UH, YOU FILLED THE PUBLIC POOLS
WITH BOTTLED WATER?

08:49.296 --> 08:50.831
- TOTAL BODY HYDRATION.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.765
- WHAT IS THIS HERE?

08:51.799 --> 08:54.668
THIS MASSIVE EXPENDITURE
FROM PUBLIC WORKS?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.737
- AH, YES. WELL, YES.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.573
WE PURCHASED HBO
FOR THE WHOLE TOWN.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.208
- I'M SORRY.
YOU SPENT GOVERNMENT MONEY

09:01.241 --> 09:03.010
ON A TV SUBSCRIPTION?

09:03.043 --> 09:05.145
- IT'S NOT TV.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.147
- ALL RIGHT.
UH, LESLIE'S PUT TOGETHER

09:07.180 --> 09:09.583
A PRESENTATION
FOR A FINANCIAL RECOVERY.

09:09.617 --> 09:10.450
- GREAT.

09:10.483 --> 09:11.384
- YOU MAY FIND IT
VERY INFORMATIVE.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.654
LET'S GET STARTED
WITH OUR FIRST SLIDE.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.790
"WELL, WELL, WELL..."

09:16.824 --> 09:18.125
TSK, TSK, TSK.

09:19.627 --> 09:22.630
- JJ, A FEW MONTHS AGO,
I CAME IN HERE

09:22.663 --> 09:23.997
AND BEGAN EATING EGGS.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.966
THEY WERE DELICIOUS,
SO I ORDERED MORE.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.901
BEFORE LONG,
I BELIEVE I HAD EATEN--

09:27.935 --> 09:29.937
- 51 EGGS IN 20 MINUTES.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.238
COULDN'T COOK 'EM
FAST ENOUGH.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.173
THE LAST TEN WERE STILL
IN THE SHELL.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.076
- IT WAS A JJ'S DINER RECORD,
AND YOU TOOK HIS PICTURE.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.146
NOW, WE NEED THAT PICTURE,
FOR PRIVACY REASONS.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.648
- OKAY, BUT I DON'T KNOW

09:40.681 --> 09:42.783
HOW ANYBODY
WOULD KNOW IT'S YOU.

09:42.816 --> 09:46.086
WE FOLLOWED
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.

09:46.119 --> 09:49.156
- THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.357
LET'S GO.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.424
- WHERE ARE WE GOING NOW?

09:51.458 --> 09:55.062
- I'VE EATEN A LOT OF FOOD
IN A LOT OF RESTAURANTS.

09:55.095 --> 09:58.832
WHY IS EVERYONE ELSE
SO BAD AT EATING?

09:58.866 --> 10:00.333
- I ONLY AGREED
TO COME BACK HERE

10:00.367 --> 10:01.401
BECAUSE OF OUR DEAL.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.670
DO YOU PROMISE
TO PLAY ALONG?

10:02.703 --> 10:03.671
- YES.
- DO YOU?

10:03.704 --> 10:05.739
- YES.
- HI, YOU'RE BACK.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.274
- HELLO AGAIN.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.776
AS YOU REMEMBER, I'M APRIL,

10:08.809 --> 10:11.645
AND THIS IS ANN,
MY 65-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.914
- YES, THAT'S WHO I AM.
ANYWAY,

10:13.947 --> 10:15.182
WE'D LOVE TO
HEAR ABOUT BLOOMINGTON.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.785
IT SEEMS LIKE A REAL HIP
KIND OF COLLEGE TOWN.

10:17.818 --> 10:21.054
- MEE-MAW, GOD, NO ONE USES
THE WORD HIP ANYMORE.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.956
SOMETIMES I WISH YOU
WENT DOWN ON THE TITANIC

10:22.990 --> 10:24.692
WITH ALL YOUR
SORORITY SISTERS.

10:24.725 --> 10:25.826
- I WOULD BE HAPPY
TO SHOW YOU GUYS

10:25.859 --> 10:26.927
AROUND THE CAMPUS.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.062
IS THERE ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR
THAT YOU WANNA SEE?

10:29.096 --> 10:30.964
- HOW ARE YOUR
LOCAL GRAVEYARDS?

10:30.998 --> 10:34.067
[whispers]
I HAVE SOME PLANNING TO DO.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.435
- "YOU BLEW IT.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.737
"SUPER HARD.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.739
"COMPLETE BUFFOONERY.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.140
IT'S HILARIOUS."

10:40.173 --> 10:41.241
AND "YOU DESERVE IT."

10:41.274 --> 10:42.710
- HEY, YOU THINK
YOU MIGHT WANNA

10:42.743 --> 10:43.510
TAKE IT EASY ON THEM
A LITTLE BIT?

10:43.543 --> 10:45.779
- OH, LIKE THEY
TOOK IT EASY ON US

10:45.813 --> 10:46.880
WHEN THEY STOLE
ALL OUR MONEY

10:46.914 --> 10:48.215
AND SECEDED FROM OUR TOWN?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.718
- THAT WAS 200 YEARS AGO.
COOL IT.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.285
- FINE. I'LL SKIP AHEAD.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.688
- DO YOU HAVE A PLAN
THAT WILL HELP US OR NOT?

10:54.722 --> 10:56.156
WE HAVE BORROWED ABSOLUTELY

10:56.189 --> 10:57.324
EVERYTHING WE CAN
FROM THE STATE.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.260
AND REALLY,
PAWNEE IS OUR ONLY HOPE.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.394
- WE DO HAVE A PLAN.

11:01.428 --> 11:05.966
WE ARE WILLING TO PROVIDE
A BRIDGE LOAN FOR $50,000.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.702
25% INTEREST
COMPOUNDED MONTHLY.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.270
AND YOU NEED TO RELEASE
A STATEMENT THAT SAYS

11:10.303 --> 11:12.072
THAT PAWNEE RULES
AND EAGLETON DROOLS.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.874
- WELL, NOW YOU'RE JUST
BEING NASTY.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.810
I UNDERSTAND THAT OUR TOWNS
HAVE A COMPLICATED HISTORY,

11:16.844 --> 11:19.479
BUT WE HAVE
A SAYING IN EAGLETON...

11:19.512 --> 11:21.448
"YOU DON'T KICK
A DRESSAGE HORSE

11:21.481 --> 11:23.483
AFTER A FAILED
PAS DE DEUX."

11:23.516 --> 11:24.551
- WHATEVER, BLONDIE.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.887
YOUR BUTLER MADE YOUR BED,
NOW YOU GOTTA LIE IN IT.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.121
AND IF YOU WALK OUT
THAT DOOR,

11:28.155 --> 11:30.758
NONE OF US HERE,
AND I REPEAT, NONE OF US

11:30.791 --> 11:32.292
WILL EVER HELP YOU AGAIN.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.426
- OH, MY GOD.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.229
THEY HAVE MICHAEL BUBLE
ON RETAINER.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.498
- OKAY, ALL PUBLIC PHOTOS
OF ME RECOVERED.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.468
NAMEPLATE REMOVED
FROM MY OFFICE DOOR.

11:41.501 --> 11:46.073
PEDIATRICIAN FILES CONFISCATED
AND DESTROYED.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.908
ANYTHING I'M MISSING?
- GREAT NEWS, RON.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.509
JEAN-RALPHIO
LOVES YOUR SHIRT.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.378
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:51.411 --> 11:52.512
- OH, I'VE BEEN TAKING PICTURES
OF YOU ALL DAY

11:52.545 --> 11:53.881
FOR MY NEW FACEBOOK ALBUM:

11:53.914 --> 11:57.317
"RONSWAN: GETTIN' OFF THE GRID."

11:57.350 --> 11:59.953
- TOM, DO YOU MAYBE
SEE A PROBLEM

11:59.987 --> 12:04.091
WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

12:04.124 --> 12:07.460
- I DO NOW.
YES, SORRY.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.797
- ERASE.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.132
ERASE. ERASE.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.501
ERASE ALL PICTURES OF RON!

12:14.534 --> 12:17.437
ERASE ALL PICTURES OF RON!

12:17.470 --> 12:20.307
ERASE ALL PICTURES OF RON!

12:20.340 --> 12:22.075
WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?

12:22.109 --> 12:24.044
- I THINK YOU ACCIDENTALLY
OPENED UP VINE.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.046
YOU JUST VINED
YOUR FIRST SELFIE, RON.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.048
- AND I'M VINING YOU
VINE YOUR SELFIE.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.351
- THE WORLD IS A NIGHTMARE.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.453
[both laughing]

12:33.486 --> 12:34.454
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

12:34.487 --> 12:37.024
- ERASE ALL PICTURES OF RON!

12:37.057 --> 12:39.126
all: ERASE ALL PICTURES
OF RON!

12:39.159 --> 12:40.193
- [laughs]

12:40.227 --> 12:42.029
- THE B-LINE
IS A COOL OUTDOOR TRAIL

12:42.062 --> 12:44.031
THAT CUTS
RIGHT THROUGH DOWNTOWN.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.800
- SHE SAID THE B-LINE
IS COOL, MEE-MAW.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.168
COOL MEANS GOOD.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.403
- THANK YOU, LAURA,
FOR SHOWING US AROUND.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.504
- SURE.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.107
SEE YOU
IN A COUPLE WEEKS, APRIL.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.209
- SEE?
THIS PLACE IS GREAT.

12:56.243 --> 12:57.945
AREN'T YOU GLAD WE CAME BACK
AND TALKED TO HER?

12:57.978 --> 12:59.446
- NO. IT WAS POINTLESS.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.948
I'M NOT GOING TO SCHOOL HERE.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.482
- APRIL, DON'T FLAKE OUT
ON THIS.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.451
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT HERE.
BLOOMINGTON IS GREAT.

13:04.484 --> 13:08.288
IT'S GOT CULTURE AND MUSIC
AND TONS OF YOUNGSTERS.

13:08.321 --> 13:11.524
YOUNGSTERS?
AM I 65 YEARS OLD?

13:11.558 --> 13:13.961
- YEAH, I'M NOT GOING HERE.
I DON'T WANT TO.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.428
LET'S LEAVE.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.233
- THINK FAST.
- OH!

13:20.267 --> 13:23.837
WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP ASSUMING
I'M READY TO CATCH THINGS?

13:23.871 --> 13:26.306
- "EAGLETON:
NO MONEY, MO' PROBLEMS."

13:26.339 --> 13:27.507
- FANTASTIC, RIGHT?

13:27.540 --> 13:28.575
I MADE ENOUGH OF THEM
FOR EVERYBODY

13:28.608 --> 13:29.409
TO WEAR AT THE GAME.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.411
- I DO LIKE
A GOOD INTERNAL RHYME.

13:31.444 --> 13:32.579
- BEN, YOU READY FOR DINNER?

13:32.612 --> 13:33.881
WE CAN GO OVER
THE POLL NUMBERS.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.949
- OH...YOU KNOW,

13:35.983 --> 13:37.617
I'VE GOT A FEW PHONE CALLS
TO MAKE.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.286
CAN YOU GIVE ME AN HOUR?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.888
- I CAN MEET YOU THERE.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.090
OH, MY GOD.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.392
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?
- I'M SORRY, LESLIE,

13:45.425 --> 13:47.294
BUT YOU DIDN'T REALLY
HELP THEM VERY MUCH,

13:47.327 --> 13:48.561
SO WE VOLUNTEERED
TO GIVE THEM

13:48.595 --> 13:50.230
A LITTLE FINANCIAL ADVICE.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.899
- YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY
HELP US AT ALL.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.534
- JUST ONE SECOND.
- YEAH.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.937
- I'M JUST GONNA
HELP THEM OUT, OKAY?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.872
- MM.
- JUST FOR AN HOUR.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.440
- HE'S JUST BEING
A GOOD NEIGHBOR.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.142
WE'RE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE,
LESLIE.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.476
- I DON'T NEED
ANY LIP FROM YOU, OKAY?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.078
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE
OF YOUR OWN STUPIDITY.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.614
- [scoffs] I HAVE A PhD
FROM THE SORBONNE.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.950
- FOR WHAT?
WEARING CHANEL SUITS?

14:09.983 --> 14:12.319
- THERE WAS
A FASHION COMPONENT, YES.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.653
- I'M NOT MAD
THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.555
YES, I AM MAD
THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS.

14:15.588 --> 14:16.456
BUT EVEN WORSE,
I'M MAD THAT YOU JUST

14:16.489 --> 14:18.125
LIED TO ME ABOUT IT.
- OKAY, I'M SORRY.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.392
- WE ALL SWORE
THAT WE WEREN'T GONNA

14:19.426 --> 14:21.028
EVER HELP HER AGAIN, EVER.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.595
- I NEVER SAID THAT.
YOU DID.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.464
- I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US
IN ALL MATTERS.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.199
THAT IS WHAT YOU
TACITLY AGREED TO

14:26.233 --> 14:27.567
WHEN YOU MARRIED ME.
- WHAT?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.336
- YEAH, LET'S GO.
YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.503
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HELP HER ANYMORE.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.338
- LESLIE, I JUST WANNA

14:36.543 --> 14:36.944
.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.011
- CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE?

14:38.811 --> 14:41.048
- WHAT, ANN?
I JUST STOLE YOUR PHONE

14:41.081 --> 14:43.283
AND TEXTED EVERY GUY IN IT
THAT THE BABY WAS THEIRS.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.584
IT'S NOT THAT BIG
OF A DEAL.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.286
- LISTEN, I KNOW
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THIS,

14:46.319 --> 14:48.221
BUT I CARE
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.357
AND I'M JUST
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

14:50.390 --> 14:52.325
THAT YOU'RE JUST NOT
FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH THIS.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.262
- YEAH, IT'S NOT ABOUT
FOLLOWING THROUGH, OKAY?

14:55.295 --> 14:57.264
I WAS ON THE FENCE ABOUT
WHETHER I WANTED TO DO IT.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.934
AND AS SOON AS I GOT THERE,
I JUST HAD A GUT FEELING

15:00.968 --> 15:02.936
THAT IT WASN'T RIGHT FOR ME,
THAT'S ALL.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.572
- SO, JUST LIKE THAT,
BOOM--HUGE LIFE DECISION MADE?

15:05.605 --> 15:07.440
- THAT'S HOW I MAKE
ALL MY LIFE DECISIONS.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.676
MY GUT IS ALWAYS RIGHT,
OKAY?

15:09.709 --> 15:11.544
IT WAS RIGHT ABOUT
MARRYING ANDY,

15:11.578 --> 15:12.712
AND IT WAS RIGHT
WHEN IT TOLD ME

15:12.745 --> 15:14.081
THAT YOU WOULD BE
THE WORST PERSON

15:14.114 --> 15:15.415
I WOULD EVER MEET
IN MY LIFE.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.317
AND I'VE MET GUY FIERI, ANN.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.418
- [chuckles]

15:18.451 --> 15:20.353
- SO GROSS!

15:20.387 --> 15:22.189
- HOW DO YOU GET YOUR GUT
TO TALK TO YOU?

15:22.222 --> 15:24.057
- YOU DON'T GET YOUR GUT
TO TALK TO YOU.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.159
YOU JUST LISTEN
WHEN IT SAYS SOMETHING.

15:26.193 --> 15:29.196
- WELL, RIGHT NOW
MY GUT IS SAYING

15:29.229 --> 15:31.098
THAT WE ARE GOING TO LISTEN
TO MARIAH CAREY

15:31.131 --> 15:32.499
THE WHOLE WAY HOME.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.267
- [vocalizing over radio]

15:34.301 --> 15:37.104
- GOOD.
- [Ann vocalizing]

15:37.137 --> 15:39.339
[whistle blows]

15:43.576 --> 15:45.412
[cheers and applause]

15:46.679 --> 15:49.016
- WHOA.
WOW, I'M REALLY SURPRISED

15:49.049 --> 15:50.617
YOU'RE SITTING ON THIS SIDE
OF THE BLEACHERS

15:50.650 --> 15:53.086
AND NOT ON THE EAGLETON SIDE
WITH YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND INGRID.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.255
- LESLIE, I'M JUST
TRYING TO HELP THEM.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.124
- WHY?
THEY WOULDN'T HELP US

15:57.157 --> 15:58.125
IF THE TABLES WERE TURNED.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.093
I MEAN,
THEY'RE 50 POINTS AHEAD,

16:00.127 --> 16:01.428
AND THEY'RE STILL DUNKING.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.230
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS GUY.

16:03.263 --> 16:06.133
THERE'S NO WAY
HE IS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

16:06.166 --> 16:09.036
- AND I'M BETTER
AT FRENCH HORN TOO, ERIC.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.103
[whistle blows]

16:10.137 --> 16:12.305
[crowd booing]

16:12.339 --> 16:14.307
- PEOPLE ARE GONNA
LOSE THEIR JOBS, LESLIE.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.476
AND THE RECOVERY
WILL TAKE YEARS.

16:16.509 --> 16:20.247
DEEP DOWN, I THINK
YOU FEEL BAD FOR THEM.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.582
- OKAY, I DO A LITTLE, YES.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.618
AND I'M SORRY THAT I BLEW UP
AT YOU YESTERDAY.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.287
WITH ALL THE RECALL STUFF
HAPPENING,

16:27.320 --> 16:30.123
I JUST REALLY NEED TO FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE ON MY TEAM,

16:30.157 --> 16:32.525
AND SEEING YOU WITH THEM

16:32.559 --> 16:34.461
MADE ME FEEL LIKE
YOU WEREN'T.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.263
- I'M ALWAYS GONNA BE
ON YOUR TEAM.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.631
YOU NEVER HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.234
[crowd chanting]
DEFENSE!

16:41.268 --> 16:43.336
all: OH!

16:43.370 --> 16:47.074
- EAGLETON PLAYER NUMBER SEVEN,
INJURED ON THE PLAY.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.341
OFFICIAL TIME-OUT.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.210
- OH, GOD.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.611
I'M GONNA SAY SOMETHING.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.081
AND IF I THROW UP ON YOU
AFTER I SAY IT,

16:54.114 --> 16:55.515
JUST KNOW THAT
YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

16:55.548 --> 16:59.452
I KNOW HOW WE CAN
HELP EAGLETON.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.121
- I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.123
I WILL GIVE YOU
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GOLD

17:03.156 --> 17:05.558
IN EXCHANGE FOR
A RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.060
- I STILL NEED AN ADDRESS
FOR INSURANCE PURPOSES.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.729
- THIS WILL BE
MY NEW HOME.

17:09.762 --> 17:14.267
THE ADDRESS IS WHEREVER
IT IS PARKED.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.768
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

17:15.801 --> 17:17.369
I HAD A FLAT TIRE,
AND I'VE BEEN TRYING

17:17.404 --> 17:19.239
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU
FOR HOURS.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.406
- SORRY, DARLING.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.310
I'VE BEEN BUSY DESTROYING
MOST OF MY PERSONAL EFFECTS

17:23.343 --> 17:25.512
AND THREATENING
A POSTAL WORKER.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.646
- RON, I KNOW YOU VALUE
YOUR PRIVACY,

17:27.680 --> 17:29.649
BUT YOU ARE A HUSBAND
AND A FATHER NOW.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.351
YOU CAN'T JUST
ROAM THE STREETS IN AN RV

17:31.384 --> 17:33.753
AND BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.588
- I'M ON A MISSION
TO GET OFF THE GRID.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.290
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
ENTIRELY ON THE GRID,

17:37.324 --> 17:39.292
BUT HAVE TO BE
ON OUR GRID.

17:39.326 --> 17:43.263
- I SUPPOSE YOU WOULDN'T
CONSIDER MOVING.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.365
I'VE HEARD THE SCHOOL SYSTEM
IN THE TUNNELS

17:45.398 --> 17:48.235
BENEATH YUCCA MOUNTAIN
IS ADEQUATE.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.237
- I LOVE YOU, BUT YOUR SOLUTION
TO EVERY PROBLEM

17:50.270 --> 17:51.504
IS TO LIVE
INSIDE A MOUNTAIN.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.574
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.509
- OKAY, ONE MORE TIME.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.744
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE

17:57.777 --> 17:59.312
YOU WANNA
GO THROUGH WITH THIS?

17:59.346 --> 18:00.747
A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE GONNA GET ANGRY,

18:00.780 --> 18:03.583
AND YOU MIGHT LOSE
THE RECALL ELECTION.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.519
- OR, IF I PULL IT OFF,
I JUST MIGHT WIN.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.755
PLUS, A VERY SMART MEMBER
OF MY TEAM

18:08.788 --> 18:11.158
POINTED OUT
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.459
- GOOD MORNING.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.127
AFTER AN ALL-NIGHT
STRATEGY SESSION,

18:14.161 --> 18:16.263
THE TOWNS OF PAWNEE
AND EAGLETON

18:16.296 --> 18:18.198
HAVE COME UP
WITH A POTENTIAL SOLUTION

18:18.231 --> 18:20.600
TO EAGLETON'S BUDGET CRISIS.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.569
- THE TOWN OF EAGLETON
WILL BE DISSOLVED

18:22.602 --> 18:25.172
AND RE-ABSORBED
INTO PAWNEE.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.174
[exclamations]

18:27.207 --> 18:28.875
PAWNEE WILL PROVIDE
SOME GOVERNMENT SERVICES,

18:28.908 --> 18:32.512
AS WELL AS TAKING ON
SOME OF EAGLETON'S DEBTS.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.680
[murmuring, commotion]

18:33.713 --> 18:34.681
- I UNDERSTAND.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.883
LOOK, I HATE EAGLETONIANS
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.518
I HATE THEIR STUPID
BEAUTIFUL FACES

18:38.551 --> 18:40.687
AND THEIR STUPID
SHINY HAIR.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.189
- WE LOOKED
AT EVERY ALTERNATIVE.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.390
THIS IS THE ONLY SCENARIO

18:43.423 --> 18:45.225
THAT PREVENTS
EAGLETON'S FINANCIAL CRISIS

18:45.258 --> 18:47.160
FROM SPIRALING THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE REGION.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.895
EAGLETON IS TERRIBLE!

18:48.928 --> 18:51.331
WHY SHOULD I BAIL THEM OUT
WITH THE HARD-EARNED MONEY

18:51.364 --> 18:52.265
FROM MY UNEMPLOYMENT CHECK?

18:52.299 --> 18:54.934
all: YEAH!
- BECAUSE THEY ARE OUR NEIGHBOR

18:54.967 --> 18:55.868
AND THEY'VE
SPRAINED THEIR ANKLE.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.205
AND WHEN YOUR NEIGHBOR
SPRAINS HIS ANKLE,

18:58.238 --> 18:59.572
YOU HELP HIM
OFF THE COURT.

18:59.606 --> 19:02.242
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE CONCERNS
AND QUESTIONS,

19:02.275 --> 19:04.277
AND WE ARE HERE
TO LISTEN TO THEM.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.179
[overlapping chatter]
- I GOT SOMETHING TO SAY.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.447
- ONE AT A TIME, PLEASE.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.349
- I HATE
THE ONE-AT-A-TIME SYSTEM!

19:09.382 --> 19:10.683
- WHY SHOULD WE
BAIL THEM OUT?

19:10.717 --> 19:12.485
NO ONE BAILED ME OUT
WHEN I GOT ARRESTED FOR ARSON.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.521
- YOU CAN'T JUST
MERGE TWO TOWNS.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.955
IT'S AGAINST THE RULES
OF NATURE.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.591
WHAT'S NEXT--
MERGING A MAN WITH HIS DOG?

19:18.625 --> 19:19.826
- I LIVE IN EAGLETON.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.694
AND FRANKLY,
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA

19:21.728 --> 19:23.230
OF LIVING IN PAWNEE.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.465
THEY'RE A LITTLE--
OH, WHAT'S THE WORD?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.799
HAVE-NO-MONEY.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.701
[exclamations]

19:28.735 --> 19:31.638
- BERTRAM, THAT'S ENOUGH.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.474
FIRST OF ALL,
EAGLETON HAS NO MONEY.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.876
SECOND OF ALL,
THEY ARE GRACIOUS ENOUGH

19:36.909 --> 19:38.245
TO THROW US A LIFELINE,

19:38.278 --> 19:39.579
AND WE SHOULD BE
ETERNALLY GRATEFUL

19:39.612 --> 19:41.381
FOR THEIR GENEROSITY.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.250
THEY'RE A TOWN OF ANGELS--

19:43.283 --> 19:45.852
GREASY, DENIM-CLAD ANGELS,

19:51.291 --> 19:51.491
.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.392
- I MEAN, DID YOU STEAL THIS
FROM A MUSEUM

19:53.092 --> 19:54.861
OR MAYBE FIND IT
FROZEN IN ICE?

19:54.894 --> 19:56.463
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE ORIGINAL PHONE

19:56.496 --> 19:57.830
FROM THE MOVIE WALL STREET.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.467
- I THINK IT'S JUST
THE ORIGINAL PHONE, PERIOD.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.536
EW, GROSS,
IT HAS "BUTTONS."

20:03.570 --> 20:06.005
- OKAY, GIRLS,
THIS IS A MAGIC PHONE, OKAY?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.974
ONLY YOU AND I
HAVE GOT THE NUMBERS.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.310
SO IF YOU EVER NEED RON
FOR ANY REASON,

20:10.343 --> 20:12.579
YOU JUST CALL AND
HE'LL BE THERE IN A FLASH.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.614
- YES, I WILL.
I'LL KEEP IT RIGHT HERE.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.516
IT SNAPS RIGHT IN,
SNUG AND SECURE.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.884
- A CELL PHONE BELT CLIP?

20:17.917 --> 20:19.986
NO, RON.
OH, MY GOD!

20:20.019 --> 20:22.655
- YEAH, I CAN'T BE SEEN
WITH YOU.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.324
- TRAVELIN' ANN PERKINS!

20:24.357 --> 20:25.658
HOW WAS BLOOMINGTON?

20:25.692 --> 20:27.360
- IT WAS AMAZING.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.861
THEY HAD ALL THE BABY
SUPPLIES WE NEED,

20:28.895 --> 20:30.763
AND THEY HAD ALL THIS
OTHER COOL STUFF.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.799
THEY HAD
A BIKE-SHARING PROGRAM

20:32.832 --> 20:36.369
AND A VEGAN
AFGHAN RESTAURANT AND--

20:36.403 --> 20:37.570
OH, MY GOD.
I'M HAVING ONE.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.806
I'M HAVING ONE RIGHT NOW.
- A CONTRACTION?

20:39.839 --> 20:41.974
- NO. DUDE, I'M, LIKE,
THREE MONTHS PREGNANT.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.344
- I-I KNOW.
I'M JUST SO EXCITED.

20:44.377 --> 20:47.980
- THE THING I'M HAVING
IS A GUT FEELING.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.649
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT
RAISING OUR CHILD

20:49.682 --> 20:52.619
SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN PAWNEE?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.655
- THANK YOU, LESLIE,

20:55.688 --> 20:57.924
FROM ALL OF US IN EAGLETON.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.693
OUR CITIZENS OWE YOU
A DEBT OF GRATITUDE.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.028
- WELL, I THINK
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

21:02.061 --> 21:04.631
EVERYBODY REALIZES
IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DO.

21:04.664 --> 21:05.698
- ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

21:05.732 --> 21:08.034
WE DID WIN
THE BASKETBALL GAME.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.502
I THINK YOU OWE US
SOME APPLES.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.538
YOU BETTER PAY UP.
- OH, YOU DON'T WANT THEM.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.540
ALL OF PAWNEE'S APPLES
HAVE BEEN RECALLED--

21:13.573 --> 21:15.642
G. COLI.
- YOU MEAN E. COLI?

21:15.675 --> 21:16.776
- I WISH.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.512
WAY EASIER TO TREAT.

21:19.546 --> 21:22.281
WELCOME TO PAWNEE!
