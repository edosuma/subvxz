00:01.001 --> 00:02.669
Previously on The Resident...

00:02.752 --> 00:05.547
I just signed with the hottest
music agent in Atlanta.

00:05.630 --> 00:07.757
You can't be a musician.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.342
You're a princess.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.219
Your time here will be coming to an end.

00:11.302 --> 00:12.387
Yo, Pravesh!

00:12.470 --> 00:14.055
JABBAAR:
Rupa is one of my goddaughters.

00:14.139 --> 00:16.808
Her son has a very rare condition.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.768
His heart is growing outside his body.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.354
I worked hard all my life
to be seen like my dad.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.689
He was a good man.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.232
We're getting hitched, baby!

00:24.315 --> 00:25.900
(cheering and applause)

00:25.984 --> 00:28.236
Nicolette Nevin, will you do me the honor?

00:28.319 --> 00:29.612
Yes.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.951
(thudding nearby)

00:35.035 --> 00:36.494
Everything okay up there?

00:36.578 --> 00:38.246
NIC:
I just dropped something.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.873
You could slow down.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.875
If we don't hurry,
we're not gonna get a table.

00:41.958 --> 00:44.085
You're the one
who wanted to shake things up.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.838
Uh, I meant like skydiving
or hiking Stone Mountain,

00:46.921 --> 00:49.632
but, hey, if this is what
you want to do, I am all in.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.675
Too much?

00:50.759 --> 00:52.135
Wow!

00:52.218 --> 00:53.219
(laughs softly)

00:53.303 --> 00:54.888
Does it go with these?

00:54.971 --> 00:56.014
Oh, my God!

00:56.097 --> 00:57.682
That's so sweet.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.768
I love them!

00:59.851 --> 01:01.269
You're wearing the ring.

01:01.352 --> 01:02.687
Aren't we still keeping that on the DL?

01:02.771 --> 01:04.898
(sighs)
For now, yes.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.609
We should let Jessica
and Irving have their moment.

01:07.692 --> 01:10.278
I was ready to shout it from the rooftops.

01:10.361 --> 01:13.823
I like having our sweet little secret.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.742
For now, anyway.

01:15.825 --> 01:18.995
But today we celebrate our engagement.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.749
We got to go.

Oh, my God.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.866

We were at this amazing drag brunch.

04:23.554 --> 04:25.431
I start on surgery tomorrow,
so I needed to decompress,

04:25.515 --> 04:27.350
-you know?
-Bullet, Ezra, not life story.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.977
This is Joseph Kinney,

04:29.060 --> 04:31.771
aka the amazing Doll E. Wood.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.524
Ezra, want to take
another shot at that bullet?

04:34.607 --> 04:36.109
Acute onset abdominal pain with syncope.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.569
-Hypotension...
-One, two, three.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.030
Hypotension improved

04:41.114 --> 04:42.824
with two liters normal saline en route.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.826
Y'all are too kind, all y'all.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.911
I'm so embarrassed, causing all this fuss.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.955
No need to be embarrassed--
this is what we do.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.248
We want to help.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.874
Let's get you into a gown,

04:51.958 --> 04:52.959
so we can do a full exam-- Ezra?

04:53.042 --> 04:54.544
You have pain like this before?

04:54.627 --> 04:55.753
Off and on.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.005
I just ignored it.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.007
With all the acrobatics, the dancing,

04:59.090 --> 05:00.967
the cinching and the tucking.
(chuckles)

05:01.050 --> 05:02.051
I threw my back out.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.177
I even had kidney stones.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.762
I'm used to hurting.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.890
Let's, uh, get an EKG as well as a CBC

05:07.974 --> 05:09.517
and a CMP to start.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.811
Doll, we're just covering all the bases.

05:11.894 --> 05:14.063
-We're gonna take good care of you.
-Okay.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.857
Dr. Feldman and I are gonna
get you some pain meds right now.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.569
Got your gown here.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.155
Oh, a gown... Oh.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.282
I don't know--
white is really not my color.

05:24.365 --> 05:25.575
I'm more of an autumn.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.493
Would you be a doll
and shut that curtain for me?

05:27.577 --> 05:28.953
You got it.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.080
I don't need the world to see this show.

05:40.548 --> 05:45.094
Tell Rupa and Salman
that the baby is stable for now.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.555
(speaking Urdu)

05:52.226 --> 05:54.437
Mm, she said she's scared.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.064
She really wants to hold him.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.066
Tell them that Baby Farhad has

05:58.149 --> 05:59.817
a combination of four heart abnormalities,

05:59.901 --> 06:02.028
known as Tetralogy of Fallot.

06:02.111 --> 06:05.239
(Nadine speaking Urdu)

06:10.536 --> 06:12.372
DEVON:
He's going to need two surgeries today.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.123
The first to repair the defects,

06:14.207 --> 06:16.042
and the second is to put
the heart back in the chest.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.835
Two surgeries in one day on a newborn?

06:17.919 --> 06:20.671
There's only been a handful
of successful surgeries worldwide.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.257
(knocking)

06:26.094 --> 06:28.513
We're going to do everything
we can to save Farhad.

06:32.975 --> 06:34.435
Where are we with the prostaglandins?

06:34.519 --> 06:35.853
They're maxed out.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.105
Well, it's not working.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.773
I did an echo ten minutes ago.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.234
His ductus arteriosus has gotten smaller.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.528
This baby needs surgery
in the next few hours.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.780
So it has to happen at Chastain.

06:45.863 --> 06:46.989
All you.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.991
This is way beyond

06:49.075 --> 06:51.661
even my exceptional abilities.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.664
This surgery has maybe
a five percent success rate.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.542
No, it's got to be done
by a pediatric cardiac surgeon

06:57.625 --> 06:59.377
who has experience in this procedure.

06:59.460 --> 07:03.005
They want to take Baby Farhad
to Boston Children's immediately.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.049
He won't survive the transport, Nadine.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.844
AUSTIN:
But we are not fully prepared here.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.262
Now, Atlanta General has

07:09.345 --> 07:11.055
a dedicated pediatric cardiac center

07:11.139 --> 07:13.433
and doctors who are trained

07:13.516 --> 07:15.435
-in this particular procedure.
-He's too unstable for transfer,

07:15.518 --> 07:18.604
-even there.
-I know, I know.

07:18.688 --> 07:19.730
Torres.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.607
You worked at Atlanta General, right?

07:21.691 --> 07:24.402
-Yeah.
-Is there a world-class

07:24.485 --> 07:26.404
pediatric cardiac surgeon
we could call in?

07:26.487 --> 07:27.989
I know just the person.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.657
Dr. Judith Brown.

07:29.740 --> 07:30.825
Call her.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.118
You got it.

07:36.205 --> 07:38.791
Hey there, pretty lady.
Look, I know everybody's real busy,

07:38.875 --> 07:41.419
but would y'all mind
taking a look at my fiancée?

07:41.502 --> 07:44.046
We've been here for a long time;
she's in a lot of pain.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.590
Technically, it's my day off.

07:45.673 --> 07:49.260
I have an incoming trauma, could... you?

07:51.179 --> 07:52.388
-Sure.
-Thanks.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.598
-I'll take a look.
-Thank you.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.850
You're the best.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.436
Yvette, hi. I'm Nic.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.812
I'm a nurse practitioner here.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.314
Um, it says here you're 23 years old.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.232
-Is that true?
-Mm-hmm.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.235
And, uh, and you're experiencing
some stomach pain.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.029
-When did that start?
-Just today.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.822
It wasn't too bad before.

08:09.906 --> 08:13.242
On a scale from one to ten,
how would you rate your pain?

08:13.326 --> 08:15.453
It's pretty bad-- I'd say a ten.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.038
I'm gonna...

08:17.121 --> 08:19.540
I'm gonna need Yvette to answer.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.546
It really hurts.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.382
I don't know, maybe...

08:28.466 --> 08:30.426
maybe a ten.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.887
Do you have any other symptoms?

08:32.970 --> 08:34.847
A little bleeding.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.390
Down there.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.143
You didn't... tell me that.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.646
All right, I'm gonna
have to do a pelvic exam.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.523
-Do you mind stepping out?
-Oh, uh...

08:43.606 --> 08:46.025
I'll stay.

08:47.151 --> 08:50.363
I'd like him to stay.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.365
There you go.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.328
I can't leave Rupa and Salman
alone for too long.

08:57.411 --> 08:59.747
I know, the NICU will let us
know when they need you back.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.582
How are you doing?
You must be exhausted.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.626
It was a long night.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.920
Well, a trip to the hospital
is not the best way

09:06.003 --> 09:08.089
to end a birthday party,
and in the middle of all of this,

09:08.172 --> 09:10.174
you have a big decision to make.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.635
Devon?

09:14.262 --> 09:16.472
My father wants me to...

09:16.556 --> 09:19.475
leave Atlanta and return home tomorrow.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.311
He's not just my father, he's... my king.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.397
There is no decision to be made.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.483
Well... is this what you want?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.652
It doesn't matter what I want.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.654
I can't put my own wishes

09:31.737 --> 09:34.740
before my obligation to my people.

09:34.824 --> 09:38.286
And with everything that
Rupa and Salman are facing,

09:38.369 --> 09:40.997
it seems selfish to even
think about it right now.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.335
Wow.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.213
So... this is our last day together.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.301
I guess it is.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.013
(pager beeping)

10:02.935 --> 10:04.312
Dr. Brown is here.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.232
How long did you two work together
at Atlanta General?

10:08.316 --> 10:09.817
Throughout fellowship.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.569
She's excellent-- she's mastered

10:11.652 --> 10:13.529
techniques used for operating
on neonatal hearts.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.489
And since we worked together,

10:15.573 --> 10:16.991
she's asked me to assist.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.913
His murmur has gotten softer
in the last hour.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.416
He's also gotten more cyanotic.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.543
Dr. Brown's gonna
have to create a shunt surgically.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.961
(monitor beeping)

10:29.045 --> 10:30.171
TORRES:
I know we tolerate

10:30.254 --> 10:31.714
lower O2 sats in infants,

10:31.797 --> 10:33.424
but his have dropped into the 50s.

10:33.507 --> 10:35.968
He's not getting enough oxygen
in his blood.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.512
This baby needs surgery now.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.431
Pravesh, you seen Dr. Brown?

10:40.514 --> 10:41.766
She's not answering her page.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.309
-No.
-I thought she was with you.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.685
Rupa and Salman want to meet her.

10:44.769 --> 10:45.811
TORRES:
Maybe later.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.522
We need to find her
and have her scrub in immediately.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.734
Looking for Dr. Brown?

10:51.817 --> 10:53.152
She's in the lab.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.236
I'll get her.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.655
You guys prep Farhad for the OR.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.865
Take Salman and Rupa back to L&D.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.379
Dr. Brown?

11:11.462 --> 11:13.005
Mm, yes?

11:13.089 --> 11:15.174
You're needed in OR Two immediately.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.425
Feel a bit of a cold coming on.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.136
This isn't a day to call in sick,

11:19.220 --> 11:22.348
so I am just giving myself
some hydration and O2.

11:22.431 --> 11:25.309
You can tell 'em I'll be right there.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.394
(clears throat)

11:31.816 --> 11:34.777
-You doctors are miracle workers.
-Ah, all we did was

11:34.860 --> 11:36.696
run some tests and give you fluids
and pain meds.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.781
The real miracle is how
you somehow managed

11:38.864 --> 11:40.700
to grab your makeup bag
and bring it in the ambulance.

11:40.783 --> 11:41.701
Well, when a girl feels her worst,

11:41.784 --> 11:42.785
that's when she must look her best.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.620
Spoken like a true icon.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.914
-Indeed.
-So I'm free to leave?

11:46.997 --> 11:48.499
No, not yet.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.167
We need to figure out
why your calcium is so high,

11:50.251 --> 11:53.587
and then treat it.
Want to explain further?

11:53.671 --> 11:56.424
Hypercalcemia could be causing
all your symptoms.

11:56.507 --> 11:59.260
Belly pain, weak muscles,
even kidney stones.

11:59.343 --> 12:01.762
High calcium.
My uncle and my daddy both had that.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.724
-Did their doctors know why?
-No.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.267
They both got pancreatic cancer.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.018
Passed away when I was in high school.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.941
BELL:
Excuse me.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.568
I heard that Dolly Parton had

12:15.651 --> 12:16.902
collapsed onstage, and I just thought...

12:16.986 --> 12:19.196
The next best thing is right here, honey.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.115
She's the person I always wanted to be.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.159
You know what Dolly always said.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.703
"Don't rent it, don't lease it, own it."

12:25.786 --> 12:27.663
I'm... sorry for intruding.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.331
I see you're in very good hands, so...

12:29.415 --> 12:31.041
Hold on, handsome.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.752
I will serenade you with Dolly's hit,

12:32.835 --> 12:34.295
"Kiss It And Make It All Better."

12:35.379 --> 12:38.591
Um... maybe later.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.011
We're gonna order some more tests,
and we'll be right back.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.137
Okay.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.723
Dr. Bell, a moment, please?

12:47.558 --> 12:49.143
I need to do genetic tests and scans,

12:49.226 --> 12:51.854
but I suspect Joseph may have MEN 1.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.564
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.232
Would that explain his family history

12:55.316 --> 12:57.193
of high levels of calcium
and pancreatic tumors?

12:57.276 --> 12:59.487
-Yes.
-If he has MEN 1, he could have a tumor

12:59.570 --> 13:00.863
in any of his endocrine glands.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.156
I'm thinking parathyroids.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.700
Which is where you would
come in, because...

13:04.784 --> 13:07.369
-if I'm right, he would need surgery.
-Yeah, okay.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.579
Let me know what you find.

13:08.662 --> 13:11.665
All right, go ahead and put in the orders.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.418
Hey.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.420
Everything okay?

13:16.504 --> 13:18.839
See the couple in Bay Four?

13:18.923 --> 13:21.091
She has pelvic inflammatory
disease from gonorrhea.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.344
Says she's 23,
but I'm not even sure she's 18.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.346
MARCUS:
We've been here all day.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.680
And he hovers.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.390
Doesn't leave her side for a second.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.683
He says they're from out of town,

13:29.767 --> 13:31.352
but she's already been in our ER

13:31.435 --> 13:32.978
for an STD a few months ago.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.647
-MARCUS: Listen to me. Listen...
-YVETTE: Just stop.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.273
You think she's being trafficked.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.567
I need your help getting her alone

13:38.651 --> 13:40.486
so that I can find out if she's safe.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.238
Okay.

13:43.906 --> 13:47.201
Yvette, Marcus, this is Dr. Hawkins.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.203
I brought him in to consult.
He also agrees

13:49.286 --> 13:51.497
that a round of antibiotics
should clear your symptoms.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.541
Great. We'll swing by the pharmacy
on our way out.

13:53.624 --> 13:54.875
-Call in a prescription?
-Nic did.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.585
But before you go,
I'll need to give you an exam.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.920
Can't you just
write me a prescription, too?

13:58.003 --> 14:00.130
Not without an examination.
Nic, why don't

14:00.214 --> 14:02.633
you take Yvette to the pharmacy
while I give Marcus...

14:02.716 --> 14:04.051
No, no, no, you ain't treating me, okay?

14:04.134 --> 14:06.387
You're treating her, and we're taking off.
Let's go.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.722
But before you do any of that,
there's something else

14:08.806 --> 14:10.766
I wanted to take a look at.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.769
Do you mind if Dr. Hawkins
listens to your heart?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.396
I heard a little abnormality

14:15.479 --> 14:16.939
when I was listening to it earlier.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.148
This'll just take a second.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.573
Yeah, I hear it, too.
She could have endocarditis.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.492
It's a life-threatening
condition and result of her STD.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.077
And can cause sudden death.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.912
Bacteria travels through the bloodstream

14:31.996 --> 14:33.747
and enters into your heart.
We absolutely have to

14:33.831 --> 14:36.375
-do a cardiac ultrasound.
-No.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.502
Doctors make up stuff
all the time to get more tests.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.005
-Come on, Yvette, let's go.
-Endocarditis is very real,

14:41.088 --> 14:42.214
I promise you.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.549
We can do the echo right now.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.134
If it's negative, you go on your way.

14:45.217 --> 14:50.014
I just... know you want Yvette to be safe.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.515
I'll do it.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.728
I don't want to die.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.355
Then we'll go right now.
Thank you.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.526
How long is this gonna take?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.236
It won't take long at all.
We'll just be right back.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.529
I'm going with her.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.114
Only patients are allowed
in the echo suite.

15:07.197 --> 15:09.533
Sorry about that.
It's just hospital rules, not mine.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.671
Dr. Brown, we are ready
for the Blalock-Taussig shunt.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.673
Great. Let's have that graft on hand.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.552
Time to dissect out the...

15:28.636 --> 15:31.680
uh... uh...

15:31.764 --> 15:33.515
The pulmonary artery?

15:35.434 --> 15:36.560
Cautery, please.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.854
Is it me, or is she a little off?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.899
This is not the surgical star
Torres led us to expect.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.859
I saw her hooked to IVs earlier,

15:43.943 --> 15:45.653
giving herself supplemental oxygen.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.613
She said she had a cold.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.450
(crackling)

15:51.533 --> 15:53.535
-(alarm beeping)
-TORRES: Laps.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.412
Suction. Clamps to Dr. Brown.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.331
She just lacerated the pulmonary artery.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.504
Dr. Brown.

16:03.587 --> 16:05.631
-Judith!
-She's definitely swaying.

16:05.714 --> 16:09.885
Dude, she may be intoxicated.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.387
Dr. Brown, I'm tagging you out.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.556
-No, you aren't. This is under control.
-You are impaired.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.685
-Torres, talk to me.
-He's exsanguinating.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.688
-I need help stopping the bleeding.
-I will stop the bleed.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.231
You've only made it worse.
His artery is turning further.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.024
(slurring):
My patient, my surgery.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.693
AUSTIN:
You are not fit to operate.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.569
Clamps to me...

16:27.653 --> 16:29.863
now.

16:35.369 --> 16:39.081
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, we stabilized the baby.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.918
BROWN:
You commandeered my surgery.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.129
Never, in all of my years of operating,

16:45.212 --> 16:49.258
have I had something so out...

16:49.341 --> 16:51.301
so outrageous happen.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.761
You should be stripped of your privileges.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.930
You tore this baby's pulmonary artery.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.557
You been drinking?

16:56.640 --> 16:58.225
That was a typical
perioperative complication.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.269
-Then submit to a blood test.
-Absolutely not.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.938
You can't refuse, Dr. Brown.
It's in every surgeon's contract

17:03.022 --> 17:03.981
at Chastain.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.942
AUSTIN:
If you say no, we will alert

17:07.026 --> 17:09.862
the hospital admin and medical board
that you refused.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.698
What are you hiding, Dr. Brown?

17:15.075 --> 17:16.577
Nothing.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.288
Then prove it.
Do the blood draw.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.582
Right here, right now,

17:21.665 --> 17:23.667
so everybody can see it.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.437
So Conrad's hypothesis was correct.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.148
This is likely MEN 1-related
abnormal growth

17:46.231 --> 17:48.942
of Doll E.'s-- or should I say Joseph's--
parathyroids.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.444
That's why his calcium is so high.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.488
Yeah, it looks like four-gland hyperplasia

17:52.571 --> 17:55.074
causing the elevated calcium,
so they'll need to be removed.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.243
This is a delicate surgery just to avoid

17:58.327 --> 18:00.537
-the critical nerves in that region.
-Correct me if I'm wrong,

18:00.621 --> 18:03.874
but damaging those nerves
could destroy Joseph's voice.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.793
Yes.
But I'll do everything possible

18:05.876 --> 18:07.503
to make sure that doesn't happen.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.631
And we'll monitor nerve function
throughout the case.

18:10.714 --> 18:13.509
"We"? So I can assist?

18:13.592 --> 18:15.594
I start on surgery tomorrow.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.888
-I've been practicing my two-handed ties.
-It was more of a...

18:17.971 --> 18:20.182
it was a royal "we."

18:20.265 --> 18:21.892
Oh.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.404
But sure, you can scrub in.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.539
JOSEPH:
My very existence

18:43.622 --> 18:45.582
as Doll E. Wood depends on my voice.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.584
Well, you could still lip-synch.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.212
Of course, but that's
not all that's involved.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.214
Dolly Parton talks, a lot.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.174
She has an intimate rapport
with her audience.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.426
Doll E. Wood has to have a voice.

18:56.510 --> 19:00.055
She must talk to her audience.
She must.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.600
Keeping your abnormal parathyroids
in place

19:03.684 --> 19:05.644
could cause a hypercalcemic crisis.

19:05.727 --> 19:06.979
EZRA:
That's what happened today.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.397
Next time you could die.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.233
You said "could"

19:11.316 --> 19:14.027
cause a fatal "hyperhoozamajiggy" crisis.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.280
-So it's not certain.
-BELL: No.

19:16.363 --> 19:19.408
But it's a risk that you shouldn't take.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.540
When I found my inner Doll,

19:26.623 --> 19:29.251
my whole life went from black and white

19:29.334 --> 19:31.670
to all the colors of the rainbow.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.506
(Ezra clears throat)

19:34.590 --> 19:36.550
(Southern accent):
"If-if you want the rainbow, you got

19:36.633 --> 19:38.051
"to put up with the rain.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.804
Storms make trees take deeper roots."

19:40.888 --> 19:43.932
Oh, this boy's a gem.
He's quoting Dolly.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.267
"If you don't like the road
you're walking,

19:45.350 --> 19:46.810
"start paving another one.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.813
We cannot direct the wind,
but we can adjust the sails."

19:49.897 --> 19:53.066
Okay, I-I think we get the gist.

19:53.150 --> 19:57.362
Everything possible
to preserve your voice.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.366
Shall we schedule the surgery?

20:06.622 --> 20:08.248
(quietly):
No.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.385
Okay.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.979
What about the ultrasound?

20:31.063 --> 20:32.522
You don't actually need it.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.858
There's nothing wrong with your heart.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.902
We just wanted to have
a private conversation with you.

20:36.985 --> 20:39.071
What did I do?

20:39.154 --> 20:41.531
Oh, nothing.
You didn't-- you didn't do anything.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.533
(exhales)
You tricked me.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.494
Marcus was right.
I can't trust you.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.412
You know, sometimes, um,

20:47.496 --> 20:49.790
in the hospital,
we see people who we think

20:49.873 --> 20:51.917
might be in a situation that isn't safe.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.586
So, um...

20:54.670 --> 20:57.422
we just wanted to make sure
that you're not one of them.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.258
I'm fine.
(sniffles)

20:59.341 --> 21:02.177
Marcus is my fiancé.
We're in love and we're getting married.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.845
I want to go now.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.473
Look, Marcus doesn't need
to know about any of this.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.350
It's your choice.
I mean, we're not gonna force you

21:08.433 --> 21:10.269
to do or say anything.
We just...

21:10.352 --> 21:14.106
We want you to know that you can.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.327
Yvette?

21:29.371 --> 21:31.123
You're safe, okay?

21:31.206 --> 21:33.834
You're totally in control here.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.421
Okay?

21:49.016 --> 21:51.101
Okay.

21:51.184 --> 21:54.021
Okay. We understand now.

21:54.104 --> 21:56.773
-(crying)
-(shushes) It's okay. It's okay.

21:56.857 --> 22:00.193
You're safe. You're safe.
We're here for you.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.535
-They're all coming out to see you, Doll.
-(laughs) Oh, stop it.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.293
I wish you'd reconsider.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.711
You're a dear.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.671
But I will take whatever time I have left

22:19.755 --> 22:22.215
as the full and complete Doll E.

22:22.299 --> 22:25.469
If I die young like my daddy,
well, so be it.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.347
Can I have-- just have a minute?

22:31.683 --> 22:36.063
You know, my dad raised me
on the Queen of Country.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.773
-Get out.
-Yeah.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.858
My daddy took me straight to Dollywood

22:39.941 --> 22:42.027
the minute I could hold up my head.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.653
I was practically baptized there.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.655
(laughs)

22:45.739 --> 22:47.574
So, were the two of you close?

22:48.617 --> 22:50.744
We were.

22:50.827 --> 22:52.788
My daddy was a pastor.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.623
I was supposed to be next in line,

22:54.706 --> 22:57.125
till he realized what was what.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.253
He knew I wasn't the son he expected.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.631
I believe that broke his heart.

23:02.714 --> 23:05.258
He talked for a while
about conversion therapy,

23:05.342 --> 23:08.720
but he saw how I felt about that
and he gave it up.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.222
When I was bullied or attacked,

23:10.305 --> 23:12.015
he was the first one in line to defend me.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.393
'Cause he was a good man, a loving man,

23:14.476 --> 23:17.396
who walked the walk of a Christian.

23:17.479 --> 23:20.107
Judge not lest ye be judged.

23:21.149 --> 23:24.444
He gave me the best gift of all.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.365
Acceptance.

23:28.448 --> 23:32.661
You know, I'm thinking that
maybe you're a lot like him.

23:32.744 --> 23:36.581
(chuckles)
Too much, as it turns out.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.668
Well...

23:39.751 --> 23:43.296
if your dad could have had the surgery,

23:43.380 --> 23:47.717
and it cost him his voice,
so he couldn't preach,

23:47.801 --> 23:49.928
but you still had your dad,

23:50.011 --> 23:55.392
would that have been better than...

23:55.475 --> 23:58.228
I see where you're headed.
Very clever.

23:58.311 --> 24:00.856
You don't have to share
the same fate as your father.

24:00.939 --> 24:04.276
We found this in time to save you.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.695
And you may wake up
with your voice intact.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.530
There's a decent chance.

24:08.613 --> 24:12.826
But if not...

24:12.909 --> 24:16.538
"I can see the light
of a clear blue morning..."

24:16.621 --> 24:19.666
BOTH:
"I can see the light of a brand-new day."

24:19.749 --> 24:21.751
-(laughs softly)
-You know.

24:23.753 --> 24:26.590
"Everything's gonna be okay."

24:26.673 --> 24:29.217
(laughs):
Oh...

24:29.301 --> 24:31.344
You better give me some sugar.

24:41.146 --> 24:44.232
So we'll schedule the surgery?

24:46.109 --> 24:47.319
Okay.

24:49.779 --> 24:52.949
How did you meet Marcus?

24:53.033 --> 24:56.203
I was 16 and fighting with my mom a lot.

24:56.286 --> 25:01.958
So I started to text with a man
named Luis that I met on an app.

25:02.042 --> 25:05.378
He told me that he'd help me run away.

25:05.462 --> 25:09.216
And after a while,
I began to like that idea.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.051
So, one day I climbed out
my bedroom window.

25:11.134 --> 25:14.054
He had a car waiting.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.972
There was another man in the car.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.517
They blindfolded me and they drove away.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.561
They drove for a long time.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.065
Most likely across state lines.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.484
Uh, they took me to a motel.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.319
Marcus was there.

25:29.402 --> 25:33.532
He said he had a client waiting for me.

25:33.615 --> 25:37.327
I had no idea what he meant, but...

25:37.410 --> 25:42.332
But then he took me to a motel room

25:42.415 --> 25:45.835
and he left me with that man
and he did what he wanted to me.

25:45.919 --> 25:49.381
My old life ended right there.

25:49.464 --> 25:53.468
After that, Marcus said
that I was now ruined,

25:53.552 --> 25:56.930
and that I belonged to him.

25:57.013 --> 25:58.473
I could never go home again.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.601
He said that no one would
ever love me except him.

26:03.603 --> 26:06.731
You know that none of that is true, right?

26:06.815 --> 26:09.067
And you are not ruined.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.403
And you're safe now.
You don't have to do that anymore.

26:11.486 --> 26:12.988
YVETTE:
I hate it.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.322
I hate all of it,
but he said that he'd kill me.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.242
He'd kill my whole family
if I ever told anyone.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.244
We're gonna make sure
that doesn't happen. Nic?

26:20.370 --> 26:21.830
We'll be back in two seconds, okay?

26:21.913 --> 26:24.165
YVETTE:
Okay.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.293
I've notified social services.

26:26.376 --> 26:29.296
They'll take over,
find her a safe place to stay.

26:29.379 --> 26:30.964
I'll go check on him.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.090
I'll stay with her.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.552
Where the hell is she?
(shouts)

26:54.904 --> 26:58.033
NIC:
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.451
It's okay, we're safe.
They've got him.

26:59.534 --> 27:01.703
-(Marcus grunting)
-It's okay.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.580
It's okay.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.916
My work is my life.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.461
I've performed the most complex surgeries.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.004
The Norwood, the Glenn, the Bentall.

27:11.087 --> 27:12.297
Sometimes back-to-back.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.715
Patients came from all over the world.

27:13.798 --> 27:17.510
Dr. Brown, you have an alcohol problem.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.095
You almost killed a baby today.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.930
That baby still needs surgery.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.766
He needs it right now.
Unfortunately,

27:22.849 --> 27:26.186
I am the only one capable
of doing it, so let's just

27:26.269 --> 27:27.687
-go back to the OR...
-AUSTIN: We are taking

27:27.771 --> 27:30.190
Baby Farhad back to the OR,
but Torres and I will operate.

27:30.273 --> 27:33.109
-No, I can do it.
-No, you cannot.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.990
That's not because I'm drunk.
I'm in withdrawal.

27:41.409 --> 27:43.286
Just get me a drink.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.163
I'll be ready to go.

27:45.246 --> 27:47.207
We'll treat you with benzos
and you can guide us.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.833
But you are not cutting.
That is final.

27:48.917 --> 27:52.295
With benzos,
I would be too drowsy to guide you.

27:52.379 --> 27:54.172
Without a drink,
my symptoms will only escalate.

27:54.255 --> 27:56.257
You've seen what happens.
These shakes will get worse,

27:56.341 --> 27:57.717
I'll vomit, maybe hallucinate.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.469
Even seize-- I know what you're thinking.

27:59.552 --> 28:01.096
You're thinking that I'm just
an addict making up a line

28:01.179 --> 28:02.597
to get her fix, but you also know

28:02.681 --> 28:04.474
that what I'm saying
is medically accurate.

28:06.184 --> 28:09.938
The fact is, unless you let me drink,

28:10.021 --> 28:13.024
I will not be able
to help you with the surgery.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.574
We got to get her a drink.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.661
-No way.
-There is no other option, Pravesh.

28:31.751 --> 28:34.796
Can you count backwards from ten?

28:34.879 --> 28:37.549
I'd rather sing,

28:37.632 --> 28:40.093
since it might be for the last time.

28:43.346 --> 28:48.226
<i>♪ It's been a long, dark night ♪</i>

28:48.309 --> 28:53.940
<i>♪ And I've been waitin' for the morning ♪</i>

28:54.023 --> 28:57.944
<i>♪ It's been a long, hard fight ♪</i>

28:58.027 --> 29:01.448
<i>♪ But I see a brand-new day ♪</i>

29:01.531 --> 29:03.742
<i>♪ A dawning ♪</i>

29:04.826 --> 29:06.786
<i>♪ And I can't s... ♪</i>

29:13.418 --> 29:14.627
Okay.

29:18.965 --> 29:20.592
Time to scrub in.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.235
One more shot.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.529
Last one, right?

29:41.613 --> 29:42.822
Mm-hmm.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.331
(Brown grunts)

29:51.414 --> 29:53.416
(sets cup down)

29:53.500 --> 29:55.502
Ready.

29:55.585 --> 29:57.962
All right. Let's make it happen.

30:04.344 --> 30:07.138
NADINE:
Baby Farhad's parents want updates.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.932
Are you gonna tell them about Dr. Brown?

30:09.015 --> 30:10.809
We usually don't if there are
no adverse outcomes to the patient.

30:10.892 --> 30:13.019
This is unacceptable.

30:13.102 --> 30:15.355
You know my dad
would never approve of this.

30:15.438 --> 30:18.233
How can giving Dr. Brown a drink be okay?

30:18.316 --> 30:20.652
It's not right.

30:20.735 --> 30:24.989
And I know that alcohol
is considered haram, and forbidden.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.826
But we've exhausted all options.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.577
This is the only possible solution.

30:29.661 --> 30:33.540
Farhad needs surgery and he needs it now.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.500
What if she gets drunk?

30:35.583 --> 30:37.502
DEVON:
She knows how much to drink to function

30:37.585 --> 30:39.170
and not get drunk.

30:39.254 --> 30:43.508
I promise you,
she will never touch Farhad again.

30:49.639 --> 30:52.225
BROWN: Let's start by freeing the skin
from the heart

30:52.308 --> 30:54.060
by tracing along the transition zone.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.562
AUSTIN:
Scalpel to me.

30:55.645 --> 30:58.064
Retractors to Torres.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.447
All right, be careful
not to pinch the P.A.

31:09.033 --> 31:11.995
-Chest is open.
-BROWN: Let's rotate the heart in.

31:14.330 --> 31:16.416
AUSTIN:
Hmm, it won't fit.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.167
TORRES:
The heart is too big.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.627
What if we take down the diaphragm?

31:19.711 --> 31:22.130
AUSTIN:
Still not enough space.

31:22.213 --> 31:23.715
You have to do a partial lung resection.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.509
Removing the right lower lobe
should give us enough room.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.219
TORRES:
That would compromise his lung function.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.264
He could end up in respiratory failure.

31:31.347 --> 31:33.850
Well, partial lung resection
is our only option.

31:33.933 --> 31:36.185
We have to take the risk.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.652
BELL:
This is the first parathyroid.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.571
Normally the size of a grain of rice,

31:46.654 --> 31:49.365
and here, it is enlarged.

31:49.449 --> 31:53.661
And right next to it is
the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.122
EZRA: Incredible. This morning
I heard him perform,

31:56.205 --> 31:58.166
and now I see what lets him sing.

32:00.293 --> 32:05.173
So we are gonna
save half this parathyroid.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.549
And reimplant it into his arm.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.344
That way he has enough
remaining gland function

32:09.427 --> 32:10.929
so his calcium doesn't plummet.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.056
BELL:
You came prepared.

32:15.141 --> 32:17.268
Would you like to assist me
in removing the next one?

32:23.232 --> 32:26.277
I have to admit, I am a bit nervous.

32:26.361 --> 32:27.946
We're working so close to the nerve.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.614
BELL:
Well, he has very challenging anatomy,

32:29.697 --> 32:30.907
but if we're careful...

32:30.990 --> 32:31.991
(monitor beeping rapidly)

32:32.075 --> 32:33.826
We lost the nerve signal.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.954
-What the hell did you do?
-Nothing. I didn't touch anything.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.998
BELL:
Give me that. Steady.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.127
The nerve may have been damaged.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.253
Dr. Bell, if he loses his voice...

32:44.337 --> 32:45.713
Stop talking.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.178
Where's Marcus?

32:52.261 --> 32:54.013
He's been arrested, Yvette.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.932
We don't want him to hurt other women.

32:56.015 --> 32:58.059
You'll be safe, where you're going.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.477
They have plenty of resources.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.437
They'll take care of you.

33:02.897 --> 33:05.817
(sniffles)
For a while.

33:05.900 --> 33:08.236
Then what?

33:08.319 --> 33:11.864
I never finished high school.
I have no way to make a living.

33:11.948 --> 33:15.410
I can't undo the mistakes I've made.

33:15.493 --> 33:16.995
You were a child, and you are blameless

33:17.078 --> 33:19.747
for what happened to you.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.917
Go take your life back.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.086
It's not gonna be easy, but I promise

33:25.169 --> 33:27.255
you can do it.

33:27.338 --> 33:31.175
I've been in and out of hospitals
a bunch of times.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.636
And no one has ever taken the time

33:33.720 --> 33:36.180
to try and help me.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.849
So thank you.

33:39.475 --> 33:41.102
Come here.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.106
You let us know
if you need anything, okay?

33:45.189 --> 33:46.649
Okay.

33:49.652 --> 33:51.863
(engine starts)

33:53.781 --> 33:55.575
Bye.

34:15.428 --> 34:19.015
AUSTIN:
Partial lung resection complete.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.351
Now place the heart into his chest.

34:28.107 --> 34:30.109
AUSTIN:
Ah... the heart is back in.

34:30.193 --> 34:32.445
Let's align the breast bone
and chest wall, then close.

34:32.528 --> 34:35.907
Sutures and wires to me, por favor.

34:35.990 --> 34:37.492
BROWN:
I'm impressed.

34:37.575 --> 34:40.244
You should consider
adding pediatric cardiac surgery

34:40.328 --> 34:41.746
to your triple board rolodex.

34:43.539 --> 34:46.542
I'm grateful for your help, Dr. Brown.

34:46.626 --> 34:47.877
But surgeon to surgeon,

34:47.960 --> 34:49.921
I really hope you seek help yourself.

34:50.004 --> 34:54.467
I don't have to tell you
that alcoholism is a disease.

34:54.550 --> 34:57.553
But there are treatment programs
for doctors.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.680
I know our system looks away.

34:59.764 --> 35:03.559
We live in a culture
that discourages asking for help

35:03.643 --> 35:04.769
or speaking up.

35:04.852 --> 35:07.814
It makes it very easy to self-destruct.

35:07.897 --> 35:10.566
But you have a gift.

35:10.650 --> 35:13.820
And you have patients who need you.

35:17.573 --> 35:19.826
Let's bring the chest wall together.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.621
(monitor beeping rapidly)

35:23.704 --> 35:25.248
AUSTIN:
BP is 40/20.

35:25.331 --> 35:26.624
Heart rate is 200.
He's about to code!

35:26.707 --> 35:28.501
TORRES:
Max out pressors.

35:28.584 --> 35:32.255
-His heart is too fragile.
-No, he's too swollen.

35:32.338 --> 35:33.631
She's right.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.842
Closing the chest
is constricting the heart,

35:35.925 --> 35:37.593
preventing it from pumping effectively.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.053
We need to keep the chest open.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.263
Cutters.

35:40.346 --> 35:41.722
Oh, this is too horrible.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.516
DEVON:
They'll try to close his chest later.

35:43.599 --> 35:46.060
But if they can't...

35:59.782 --> 36:01.951
All right, the swelling's gone down.

36:02.034 --> 36:04.203
It's time to close his chest.

36:04.287 --> 36:05.872
Back to the OR?

36:05.955 --> 36:08.207
No.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.459
We're gonna do it right here.

36:29.437 --> 36:32.607
Bringing the chest wall
and sternum together.

36:40.948 --> 36:44.076
TORRES:
Pressure and heart rate are stable.

36:44.160 --> 36:48.581
Heart is pumping effectively.

36:48.664 --> 36:50.541
AUSTIN:
He'll need more surgeries in the future

36:50.625 --> 36:54.503
to reconstruct his chest,
but at least for now,

36:54.587 --> 36:57.632
he has a chance to thrive.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.219
One last thing...

37:03.304 --> 37:05.056
Little man needs his armor.

37:15.816 --> 37:17.401
Hey.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.153
Just got off the phone with my dad.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.530
He's really happy to hear
Farhad's doing so well.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.324
Yeah, he beat the odds.

37:23.407 --> 37:26.577
Chastain came through.
And we got lucky.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.204
There's more, Devon.

37:28.287 --> 37:32.250
My dad said if you wanted
to continue seeing me,

37:32.333 --> 37:35.086
you could come be a doctor in my country.

37:35.169 --> 37:37.922
He would get you a great spot
in our finest hospital.

37:38.005 --> 37:39.757
Wow.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.635
That's lovely.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.515
But this is my home.

37:47.598 --> 37:50.142
Please, just think about it.

37:50.226 --> 37:52.728
The offer stands.

37:52.812 --> 37:56.107
Things don't have to end between us.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.781
When's your flight home?

38:03.864 --> 38:05.324
Tomorrow morning.

38:05.408 --> 38:08.452
-You done with your shift?
-Yeah.

38:08.536 --> 38:09.578
Yeah?

38:09.662 --> 38:11.664
Good.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.922
Not here.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.188
MAN (over P.A.):
Red gurney to surgical waiting area...

38:36.272 --> 38:37.231
BELL:
Joseph.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.401
Good to see you awake.

38:40.484 --> 38:43.779
Surgery went well.
Your calcium levels are stable.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.657
-Can we hear your voice?
-That's premature.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.412
It'll take him a little while to recover.

38:51.495 --> 38:55.416
(whispering):
It's okay, I...

38:55.499 --> 38:57.418
(clears throat)

38:59.045 --> 39:02.298
It... it doesn't sound good.

39:02.381 --> 39:05.384
Well, that is to be expected.

39:05.468 --> 39:07.303
You're going to be hoarse
after being intubated.

39:07.386 --> 39:08.387
It's normal.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.932
It'll get better. Soon.

39:15.227 --> 39:17.313
Will it be like before?

39:19.357 --> 39:21.484
I hope so.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.613
Thank you both.

39:29.241 --> 39:32.078
It's in God's hands.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.794
What are we doing next Sunday?

39:39.877 --> 39:42.546
Let's go back to brunch.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.298
We did not get the full experience,

39:44.382 --> 39:45.591
not by a long shot.

39:45.674 --> 39:47.468
I can't believe that was this morning.

39:47.551 --> 39:49.845
Ah, just another day at the office.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.472
(Nic chuckles softly)

39:51.555 --> 39:52.848
-So...
-Hmm.

39:52.932 --> 39:55.226
So we're gonna start telling
everyone we're engaged, huh?

39:55.309 --> 39:58.521
Let's shout it from the rooftops.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.439
(both chuckle)

40:02.525 --> 40:05.403
Oh, and in the spirit of being open,

40:05.486 --> 40:06.987
I have a confession.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.573
I, um, may or may not
have eaten the chocolates

40:09.657 --> 40:10.825
that you hid in your sock drawer.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.368
-You didn't.
-I did.

40:12.451 --> 40:13.994
-Aw...
-(laughs)

40:14.078 --> 40:17.748
-Well, I have nothing to confess.
-Oh, really? Nothing?

40:20.000 --> 40:21.836
Fine.

40:24.296 --> 40:28.217
That diamond on your ring is fake.
It's cubic zirconium.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.719
-Really?
-Yes.

40:30.803 --> 40:32.805
Huh, it looks so real.

40:32.888 --> 40:34.765
Well, in that case, you want it back?

40:34.849 --> 40:36.851
-Wait...
-I mean, if it's fake...

40:36.934 --> 40:38.144
-What?
-We don't have to get married.

40:38.227 --> 40:39.979
-Honestly. (laughing)
-No. No, no, no, no, no.

40:40.062 --> 40:42.231
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.611
I love it.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.928
This isn't over.
