WEBVTT

00:01.211 --> 00:03.048
[June] Previously
on The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.215 --> 00:05.678
She's not gonna be a wife.
That is not fucking happening.

00:06.221 --> 00:09.519
How am I supposed to keep
my baby girl safe from here?

00:09.770 --> 00:11.649
[Commander Mackenzie]
We want you in Toronto.

00:12.066 --> 00:14.320
To best represent
our sacred republic.

00:14.571 --> 00:16.533
Mrs. Waterford,
you are officially released

00:16.617 --> 00:18.704
from the custody
of the American government.

00:19.497 --> 00:22.044
You'll be restricted
to Gilead-affiliated properties

00:22.127 --> 00:24.382
in accordance with
your lack of diplomatic status.

00:25.175 --> 00:26.135
Building codes.

00:26.595 --> 00:30.310
I've found 15 violations that
could get this place condemned.

00:30.770 --> 00:32.983
Or just help us get Hannah back.

00:33.526 --> 00:37.575
Agnes is happy. I do wonder
why you never returned to Gilead

00:37.659 --> 00:38.953
to save your daughter.

00:39.036 --> 00:41.374
I mean,
there were risks of course.

00:41.875 --> 00:42.794
Which your wife took.

00:43.128 --> 00:44.965
You stay away from my family.

00:46.342 --> 00:47.637
Or the next time I see you,

00:47.721 --> 00:49.181
I'm gonna fucking
kill you myself.

00:50.560 --> 00:53.983
[Luke] She's not gonna pull
a fuckin' Gilead bullshit here!

00:54.066 --> 00:55.402
-[protesters arguing]
-[gunshots]

00:55.485 --> 00:56.321
Come on. We gotta go.

00:56.404 --> 00:57.239
Where are we supposed to go?

00:57.323 --> 00:58.576
We're working on that,
but it's not safe here.

00:58.659 --> 00:59.493
Stay back!

01:00.370 --> 01:02.374
[June] I didn't do it this time.

01:02.792 --> 01:06.967
But I am not going to promise
that I won't do it next time.

01:07.051 --> 01:09.055
I can't promise I won't either.

01:09.221 --> 01:11.351
I guess we'll just have
to trust each other.

01:11.894 --> 01:13.731
[Ezra] For those
who are truly righteous,

01:13.814 --> 01:15.317
He sometimes sends a refuge.

01:15.442 --> 01:16.277
[Mrs. Wheeler] Mrs. Waterford.

01:16.820 --> 01:18.824
I'm Mrs. Ryan Wheeler.

01:18.949 --> 01:22.122
[gasps]
Welcome to our home.

01:24.795 --> 01:26.464
[water bubbling, swishing]

01:55.063 --> 01:56.608
[imperceptible]

02:02.537 --> 02:03.831
[phone vibrating]

02:11.137 --> 02:11.972
Hello?

02:12.264 --> 02:13.099
[clears throat]

02:16.189 --> 02:17.024
Yes?

02:17.817 --> 02:18.652
What?

02:20.405 --> 02:21.240
Yes.

02:21.533 --> 02:22.367
What?

02:23.119 --> 02:24.706
And Lily didn't give you
any more details?

02:24.831 --> 02:25.666
No.

02:27.002 --> 02:28.631
Just that a Guardian
was coming across

02:28.714 --> 02:30.258
with information
about Wife Schools.

02:30.802 --> 02:33.473
Maybe Hannah.
We need to get there.

02:33.766 --> 02:35.352
He might know
where she is.

02:37.064 --> 02:38.107
[shouting indistinctly]

02:38.107 --> 02:39.235
[Moira] These assholes are back?

02:39.318 --> 02:40.153
Jesus.

02:40.237 --> 02:42.199
[shouting indistinctly]

02:42.241 --> 02:43.827
[man 1] Go home, Yankees!
We don't need your shit here!

02:44.203 --> 02:45.665
[man 2] Canada is for Canadians,
you motherfuckers!

02:46.708 --> 02:48.294
[Moira] Those fucking assholes.

02:51.050 --> 02:52.762
[woman] Get the fuck
out of our country!

02:52.846 --> 02:53.681
[man 3] Go home, Yankees!

02:54.808 --> 02:55.643
[birds chirping]

03:09.044 --> 03:10.840
[indistinct radio chatter]

03:38.061 --> 03:38.896
Blessed day.

03:39.438 --> 03:41.902
Good morning, Mrs. Waterford.
Lovely day today.

03:42.528 --> 03:44.699
Yes, it is. It truly is.

04:00.815 --> 04:02.150
Good morning, Mrs. Waterford.

04:03.069 --> 04:04.238
Blessed day, Ezra.

04:04.781 --> 04:07.704
Um, these were left for you
by a well-wisher.

04:07.829 --> 04:09.498
Oh, thank you.

04:10.668 --> 04:13.924
Uh, is, um,
is Mr. Wheeler around?

04:14.049 --> 04:15.594
I'd like the chance to meet him.

04:16.680 --> 04:20.437
To thank him for his support
and generosity.

04:21.439 --> 04:22.859
Yes. Um...

04:23.861 --> 04:25.280
He's usually pretty busy.

04:28.161 --> 04:29.246
But, uh, I'll check.

04:31.752 --> 04:33.212
Great. I appreciate it.
Thank you.

04:41.353 --> 04:42.982
[china clanking]

04:46.447 --> 04:49.036
Blessed day, Mrs. Waterford.
How did you sleep?

04:49.119 --> 04:51.875
Blessed day.
Oh, it was lovely, thank you.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.674
You don't have to keep making
these wonderful feasts for me.

04:55.758 --> 04:58.387
I-I, you know,
something simple is fine.

04:58.471 --> 04:59.431
For the both of us.

04:59.516 --> 05:03.439
Well. I am not about to let
Serena Joy Waterford

05:03.565 --> 05:05.528
go wanting in my home.

05:05.820 --> 05:07.698
Please. Our home is your home.

05:08.032 --> 05:09.953
Thank you. You're...
You're too kind.

05:10.078 --> 05:11.665
You've already done so much.

05:12.207 --> 05:15.213
I'm afraid that we haven't done
enough, Mr. Wheeler and I.

05:15.881 --> 05:19.388
Gilead feels so far away,
even in our prayers.

05:20.641 --> 05:22.310
When I see
your strength and faith,

05:22.394 --> 05:25.233
I see why God put
His divine light in you.

05:25.985 --> 05:28.322
Giving you a refuge
is the very least we could do.

05:28.447 --> 05:30.578
Getting you away
from those awful people.

05:30.786 --> 05:33.374
Well, we always knew
there would be some

05:33.457 --> 05:35.420
who would resist our message.

05:35.754 --> 05:38.886
Selfish, small-minded people.
That's what they are.

05:46.275 --> 05:47.277
[exhales]

05:47.402 --> 05:51.828
Well, um, we will have that
Center on track in no time.

05:52.872 --> 05:55.001
I thought that they were
shutting it down indefinitely.

05:56.086 --> 05:59.134
We can't let a few simple rules
get in the way of God's will.

06:00.554 --> 06:01.388
Can we?

06:03.894 --> 06:04.729
[chuckles]

06:36.543 --> 06:37.377
Him, too.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.880
You all should hear.

06:39.464 --> 06:40.509
Why, what's going on?

06:41.093 --> 06:42.638
Our friendly's right there
in No Man's Land,

06:42.722 --> 06:43.890
but he can't get across.

06:44.517 --> 06:46.771
Canadian Border Patrol's
really stepped up,

06:46.855 --> 06:48.441
he doesn't wanna
risk getting caught.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.071
Canada wants us out of here.

06:51.614 --> 06:53.075
They're making it
really fucking clear

06:53.159 --> 06:54.494
that we've worn out our welcome.

06:55.204 --> 06:56.708
So that's just it? You're done?

06:57.125 --> 06:58.628
We're never
fucking done fighting.

06:59.296 --> 07:00.966
There are other places
for us to go setup.

07:01.050 --> 07:02.803
But I'm sorry you made
this trip for nothing.

07:03.429 --> 07:04.431
He just put up the flag.

07:04.515 --> 07:07.479
If he'd done it earlier,
I'd have called it off.

07:20.296 --> 07:21.131
I'm going across.

07:24.555 --> 07:25.389
What?

07:31.903 --> 07:34.407
Look, everything we want
to know about Hannah

07:36.036 --> 07:37.330
is just there.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.546
Where she is, how to find her.

07:40.671 --> 07:43.217
I'm-- I'm not gonna go home
and watch Hannah

07:43.300 --> 07:45.012
turn up on TV again with Serena.

07:45.096 --> 07:47.016
I'm not... I'm not doing it.
I'm going.

07:48.394 --> 07:49.229
I'm going.

07:51.316 --> 07:52.152
Fine.

07:52.695 --> 07:54.156
I can let someone know
you're coming.

07:54.782 --> 07:55.617
All right.

07:55.701 --> 07:57.538
We've got a meeting spot
in No Man's Land we use.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.750
Getting there from here
shouldn't be too hard.

08:00.251 --> 08:01.086
If you're lucky.

08:03.800 --> 08:04.760
I'm going with you.

08:05.637 --> 08:08.267
-June...
-You're not going alone, so...

08:09.937 --> 08:10.772
I'm going.

08:22.838 --> 08:24.466
[Moira] Couldn't stuff
any more in these bags.

08:24.717 --> 08:26.178
[Lily] Might be our last
exchange of supplies

08:26.261 --> 08:27.472
with Gilead for a while.

08:27.556 --> 08:28.390
Here.

08:30.436 --> 08:32.816
-[Moira] Rita's okay, right?
-Yeah, she's okay.

08:33.442 --> 08:37.701
Nichole's sleeping.
I told her we'd be back soon.

08:39.371 --> 08:41.626
Okay. You go
across the scrub land.

08:41.709 --> 08:42.836
No Man's Land is right there.

08:43.128 --> 08:44.840
You should get to
the meeting spot by morning.

08:45.842 --> 08:47.262
I've marked
the best trail on the map.

08:47.721 --> 08:49.474
You should be able
to avoid any patrols.

08:49.559 --> 08:51.896
It'll lead you right to
the rendezvous spot and back.

08:51.980 --> 08:53.023
And who are we meeting?

08:53.399 --> 08:55.444
No names. Names are dangerous.

08:56.238 --> 08:58.827
Look for the other flag.
That's the meeting spot.

08:59.077 --> 09:00.162
You got the code word?

09:00.831 --> 09:01.666
"Beret."

09:05.381 --> 09:06.216
You guys got this.

09:08.596 --> 09:09.431
Come here.

09:14.482 --> 09:16.988
[Lily] You should get going.
It'll be dark soon.

09:17.781 --> 09:18.908
Just make sure you come back.

09:48.384 --> 09:49.887
[wires buzzing]

10:20.782 --> 10:22.034
[imperceptible]

10:23.955 --> 10:25.499
- [Luke] Go with Mommy.
- [June] What about you?

10:25.584 --> 10:27.420
No, no, it's all right. You go.
Go! Run, run, run!

10:27.504 --> 10:28.798
-Run, run!
-[breathing unsteadily]

10:31.386 --> 10:32.221
-[gasps]
-[squeals]

10:32.472 --> 10:36.522
Hey. You need to take a break?

10:37.733 --> 10:38.860
[breathing unsteadily]

10:39.945 --> 10:41.532
-[screaming]
-Please! Just don't take her!

10:43.912 --> 10:45.749
No, no.

10:45.874 --> 10:47.669
Really-- Just think about--
I need to take a break.

10:47.753 --> 10:48.588
I could do with a break.

10:49.757 --> 10:52.220
I'm okay. Really.
Come on, we have to go.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.138
June...

11:04.285 --> 11:05.412
[both sigh]

11:07.876 --> 11:09.087
They'll follow the map.

11:10.256 --> 11:11.091
They'll be fine.

11:14.347 --> 11:15.182
Here.

11:16.811 --> 11:17.646
[chuckles]

11:20.694 --> 11:22.029
What's the deal with those two?

11:23.115 --> 11:23.950
Mm...

11:29.294 --> 11:30.129
[exhales]

11:31.716 --> 11:32.551
They don't quit.

11:35.599 --> 11:37.603
Through all the shit they've
been through, they just...

11:40.316 --> 11:42.153
keep fighting for each other.

11:45.159 --> 11:45.994
That's really nice.

11:47.163 --> 11:48.625
Having someone like that.

11:52.465 --> 11:53.300
Yeah.

11:55.429 --> 11:56.641
So, where are you guys
going next?

11:59.103 --> 11:59.939
Maine?

12:00.899 --> 12:01.984
Montreal?

12:02.443 --> 12:03.403
-Maybe.
-Detroit?

12:03.988 --> 12:05.407
-Detroit?
-Yeah.

12:06.117 --> 12:07.871
I wouldn't even
go there before!

12:08.831 --> 12:09.667
Why not?

12:11.002 --> 12:12.004
What's in Detroit?

12:12.088 --> 12:14.467
Oh! Nah, fuck Detroit.

12:14.843 --> 12:16.972
-There's so many better--
-Fuck Detroit!

12:17.056 --> 12:18.935
There's so many better cities!

12:19.102 --> 12:20.939
I'm from Detroit.
[cackles]

12:21.439 --> 12:23.861
Oh! Are you serious?

12:24.445 --> 12:26.116
-Yeah!
-[laughing]

12:26.491 --> 12:28.370
[branches snapping]

12:43.233 --> 12:45.739
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

12:51.499 --> 12:52.669
Oh, my God.

12:55.382 --> 12:59.516
Is... Is that, uh...
Is that Gilead?

13:01.352 --> 13:02.689
Gilead doesn't use words.

13:07.866 --> 13:08.701
Come on.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.011
Luke, come on.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.771
Oh, my God. [grunts]

13:24.273 --> 13:25.777
[birds chirping]

13:28.365 --> 13:30.077
[women indistinctly chattering]

13:34.001 --> 13:34.837
They're waiting for you.

13:40.890 --> 13:42.686
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.

13:43.938 --> 13:45.440
[chatter continues]

13:50.827 --> 13:51.662
Ladies.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.543
Mrs. Serena Joy Waterford.

13:55.712 --> 13:57.632
-Blessed day.
-Praise be.

13:57.757 --> 13:58.968
-Praise be.
-Praise be.

14:04.270 --> 14:07.819
I've been trying
for so long. So long.

14:07.944 --> 14:11.952
I know, Abbie. I know.
We all have.

14:12.662 --> 14:15.125
But seeing Mrs. Waterford
gives me hope.

14:15.292 --> 14:16.921
It strengthens my faith.

14:18.841 --> 14:22.014
Oh! He just kicked.

14:22.097 --> 14:23.726
[all exclaim]

14:25.897 --> 14:26.774
May I?

14:28.276 --> 14:29.111
Please, yes.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.292
[all exclaiming]

14:38.881 --> 14:39.967
[laughing softly]

14:40.635 --> 14:42.137
-May I?
-Please.

14:44.768 --> 14:46.145
[Mrs. Wheeler]
It's such a miracle.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.316
Such a blessing.

14:50.487 --> 14:52.617
[woman] You give me hope,
Mrs. Waterford.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.412
-[giggles]
-Praise be.

14:54.579 --> 14:56.040
[all laughing softly]

14:59.422 --> 15:01.844
[woman 2] A little boy.
I always wanted a little boy.

15:03.848 --> 15:06.144
[Naomi] Warren said that things
are going well in D.C.

15:07.021 --> 15:09.233
There's a lot
to discuss and rebuild

15:09.316 --> 15:10.653
but he should be home soon.

15:10.820 --> 15:12.239
Fred says much of the same.

15:12.699 --> 15:14.745
Is he worried
about the rebels in Chicago?

15:14.870 --> 15:16.372
No, they'll be put down soon.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.919
[Naomi] I can't believe
anyone would be fighting

15:19.003 --> 15:20.673
for what this country
used to be.

15:21.508 --> 15:23.888
How it used to be.
I mean, who would want that?

15:24.180 --> 15:26.560
Some people just have
a hard time moving on.

15:28.354 --> 15:29.858
[exhales]
I don't know, Serena.

15:32.112 --> 15:33.783
Can you see any
of these in your home?

15:37.289 --> 15:38.584
No. I can't.

15:41.673 --> 15:43.134
I mean, I'm glad
they rescued these children

15:43.218 --> 15:44.596
from those unfit mothers.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.226
They needed to be saved.

15:48.521 --> 15:50.065
They need good homes.

15:51.359 --> 15:53.823
Good families to raise them
in God's light.

15:54.156 --> 15:54.991
Of course.

15:56.703 --> 15:58.791
Of course they do, poor dears.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.174
You just... You never really
know where they came from.

16:04.260 --> 16:06.598
Or who they came from. Do you?

16:27.724 --> 16:31.272
Have they spoken to you
about having a Handmaid?

16:32.734 --> 16:34.236
Sounds even more dreadful.

16:35.698 --> 16:36.700
Are you considering it?

16:36.783 --> 16:39.915
No. Fred and I
are going to keep trying.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.338
God will bless us. I know it.

16:58.953 --> 17:00.372
-Should be here.
-Hmm.

17:03.002 --> 17:03.837
Hey, June.

17:07.762 --> 17:08.597
Yeah.

17:19.034 --> 17:19.911
[gun cocks]

17:21.999 --> 17:25.506
Raspberry! Raspberry!

17:26.090 --> 17:27.384
-Uh...
-Beret.

17:37.780 --> 17:38.616
Not here.

17:39.701 --> 17:40.620
-What do you mean?
-Follow me.

17:40.703 --> 17:41.705
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

17:41.788 --> 17:43.291
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

17:43.374 --> 17:45.588
No one... No one said to us
anything about going anywhere.

17:45.671 --> 17:47.633
You have to give us information
about the Wife Schools first.

17:47.717 --> 17:49.679
It's not safe during the day.
There's a place nearby.

17:49.763 --> 17:51.057
[June] No, no, no.
We're not going anywhere.

17:51.140 --> 17:52.434
-Hey, hey. No, hold on!
-We're doing this here.

17:52.518 --> 17:53.353
We're doing this now.

17:53.436 --> 17:55.106
-We're not following you.
-You don't have to come with me.

17:55.190 --> 17:57.862
I have to go.
I have to go. Now!

18:13.977 --> 18:16.817
You can take the call
from Gilead in here.

18:18.696 --> 18:20.323
Thank you.
I'm glad we don't have to

18:20.407 --> 18:22.327
go through the Americans
or the government.

18:23.121 --> 18:24.582
Mr. Wheeler has his ways.

18:25.083 --> 18:27.087
You can be on the call
if you want.

18:27.337 --> 18:29.717
I'm sure that they would love
to hear from you.

18:30.511 --> 18:34.017
Oh, no. No, no. I don't have
a head for all of that. No.

18:35.019 --> 18:37.900
No, wives shouldn't burden
themselves with business things.

18:49.423 --> 18:50.258
[beeps]

18:51.636 --> 18:52.597
Hello, Joseph.

18:54.141 --> 18:55.644
Afternoon, Serena.

18:57.272 --> 18:58.567
Blessed day, Serena.

18:59.485 --> 19:00.320
Warren.

19:02.199 --> 19:03.827
I didn't expect you
to be on the call.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.371
Yeah. No one did.

19:08.211 --> 19:12.469
After, uh, all of that mess
at the Center,

19:12.595 --> 19:14.431
you've-- you've recovered?
You sound peachy.

19:15.308 --> 19:17.270
Yes, Joseph. I am "peachy."

19:18.607 --> 19:21.070
I think we can
move past all of that now.

19:21.195 --> 19:23.157
[Commander Putnam] We sent you
there to be our representative,

19:23.742 --> 19:25.955
put Gilead in a good light.

19:27.082 --> 19:28.084
Do you think you did that?

19:28.877 --> 19:31.591
I can't be expected to control
the refugees who hate us

19:31.675 --> 19:33.052
because of things
that the government did.

19:33.219 --> 19:35.516
See, this is already
an expensive,

19:35.599 --> 19:37.310
costly endeavor for us.

19:37.853 --> 19:39.064
What do we have to show for it?

19:39.732 --> 19:42.613
An empty building.
More bad press.

19:42.822 --> 19:45.703
Well, you can thank June Osborn
and her husband for that.

19:46.370 --> 19:48.082
Perhaps someone
should deal with them.

19:48.207 --> 19:49.961
Yes. Someone should.

19:50.963 --> 19:55.764
June Osborn aside, we're still
focused on reopening the Center.

19:55.848 --> 19:58.436
Yes, I, uh, had
some ideas on that.

19:58.520 --> 20:02.068
I think focusing on Gilead
is a mistake.

20:04.323 --> 20:05.158
You think

20:05.909 --> 20:11.755
the Gilead Information Center
focusing on Gilead is a mistake?

20:11.880 --> 20:14.176
I think we should
focus on fertility.

20:15.261 --> 20:17.432
Fertility and conception.
It's about the babies.

20:17.516 --> 20:19.311
That's what people
want to hear about.

20:19.771 --> 20:23.695
A Gilead Information Center will
always be a magnet for attack.

20:24.196 --> 20:25.908
But a fertility center,
open to all,

20:25.991 --> 20:27.452
that focuses on the thing

20:27.536 --> 20:29.832
that people most
wanna hear about, children.

20:30.793 --> 20:33.214
People will be clamoring
to keep the doors open.

20:36.136 --> 20:37.723
It's an interesting idea.

20:38.684 --> 20:40.019
Yes, I think the first step--

20:40.103 --> 20:42.023
We'll take your proposal
under consideration.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.111
Well, I've already thought about
how best to redefine--

20:44.194 --> 20:47.033
I said we'll take your proposal
under consideration, Serena.

20:47.117 --> 20:48.411
-Praise be.
-[Serena speaking indistinctly]

20:48.494 --> 20:49.413
-[line disconnects]
-...strategy.

20:51.918 --> 20:55.509
You've always had a way
with the ladies, Putnam.

20:57.012 --> 20:59.349
Can't let her just run amok.

20:59.474 --> 21:02.480
We have to yank her leash
from time to time.

21:02.648 --> 21:04.694
Yeah. We all know
how you like to yank things.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.954
This new grand plan of yours.
What are you calling it?

21:10.789 --> 21:13.670
Uh... [clears throat]
New Bethlehem.

21:14.505 --> 21:15.339
I don't like it.

21:17.177 --> 21:19.264
It'll be the death of us all.

21:20.016 --> 21:20.893
Of Gilead.

21:25.318 --> 21:28.575
A bunch of traitors,
criminals, terrorists,

21:28.742 --> 21:31.163
and you want to
welcome them back.

21:31.956 --> 21:32.792
Coddle them.

21:33.877 --> 21:34.837
Forgive them.

21:35.839 --> 21:36.674
Never.

21:36.841 --> 21:40.389
The other Commanders
will never support that.

21:40.473 --> 21:44.481
What are you proposing we do?

21:45.191 --> 21:47.780
We don't need to court
the love and support

21:47.863 --> 21:49.032
of the whole world.

21:49.534 --> 21:51.955
We don't want them
poking around in our affairs.

21:52.247 --> 21:55.963
If we keep the walls up
and the borders closed,

21:56.046 --> 21:58.425
this country will die, Putnam.

21:59.010 --> 21:59.887
It will die.

22:02.852 --> 22:03.979
All of this...

22:06.275 --> 22:08.905
will have been for nothing.
Nothing.

22:11.619 --> 22:12.663
[blows air]

22:12.788 --> 22:14.792
Wow. That was
a lovely speech, Lawrence.

22:16.003 --> 22:16.838
Lovely.

22:17.422 --> 22:18.633
You really think
another speech from you

22:18.717 --> 22:20.512
is gonna sway
the other Commanders?

22:22.473 --> 22:23.350
Mm?

22:24.645 --> 22:25.522
I doubt it.

22:29.279 --> 22:30.532
You know,
you're welcome to try.

22:37.170 --> 22:38.005
[chuckles]

23:31.696 --> 23:32.573
[guardian] In here.

23:48.312 --> 23:49.230
Hang on.

23:49.356 --> 23:50.357
[switch clicks]

23:52.905 --> 23:54.575
[beeping]

23:55.619 --> 23:56.996
[arcade noises]

23:59.167 --> 24:00.002
[June] What the fuck?

24:01.756 --> 24:03.718
[guardian] When it's cold out,
I spend most of my shift here.

24:05.096 --> 24:05.931
Beats freezing in the woods.

24:06.389 --> 24:08.895
And, uh,
there's a real bathroom.

24:22.965 --> 24:23.925
All right.

24:24.342 --> 24:25.846
Oh, don't. I got 'em.

24:26.514 --> 24:27.808
There's a whole system.

24:29.394 --> 24:35.072
Um... these go with you.

24:38.580 --> 24:41.001
So, you want to know
about the Plums?

24:42.420 --> 24:43.255
Plums?

24:43.840 --> 24:44.675
The Wives-in-Training.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.346
They get sent to these special
schools, kept under guard?

24:48.683 --> 24:49.518
What, like prisons?

24:50.227 --> 24:52.566
No, no. They're like princesses.

24:52.649 --> 24:54.820
Completely taken care of,
the best of the best.

24:55.822 --> 24:56.782
What's this training?

24:58.536 --> 24:59.788
To run their households.

25:01.667 --> 25:02.878
To act like Wives.

25:03.045 --> 25:04.088
They're not there for very long.

25:04.172 --> 25:04.965
They move them through,

25:05.090 --> 25:06.510
try and get them
matched up quickly.

25:06.969 --> 25:09.057
She's 12 years old, all right?

25:09.182 --> 25:11.854
Our daugh-- she's--
she's 12 years old.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.236
That's just how it works.

25:19.828 --> 25:20.747
But if she's there,

25:22.083 --> 25:23.210
if she's still a Plum,

25:23.628 --> 25:24.713
then she hasn't been
married yet.

25:29.890 --> 25:32.478
Uh, I don't know
where the schools are.

25:32.938 --> 25:34.775
It's a new system, they keep
the details under wraps.

25:34.900 --> 25:39.075
But everything
we do know is on here.

25:41.288 --> 25:43.000
A lot of trouble getting it,
I'll tell you that.

25:45.797 --> 25:46.590
Thank you.

25:46.882 --> 25:48.176
All right. Come on. Let's go.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.565
-Hang on. You can't go yet.
-Why not?

25:55.692 --> 25:57.904
You can't go back across during
the day. It's really not safe.

25:58.531 --> 25:59.365
For anyone.

26:00.034 --> 26:01.077
I mean, you can
do whatever you want,

26:01.161 --> 26:02.455
but you should stay here
until sunset

26:02.539 --> 26:03.875
and then I'll get you
back to the border.

26:11.515 --> 26:12.851
I mean, we're both kinda beat.

26:18.236 --> 26:19.072
What do you think?

26:22.954 --> 26:23.790
Okay.

26:24.750 --> 26:25.585
Yeah?

26:27.923 --> 26:28.758
All right.

26:30.427 --> 26:31.262
You wanna bowl?

26:36.649 --> 26:37.734
[arcade noises]

26:37.859 --> 26:39.530
[Luke] C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon. Here it comes.

26:39.655 --> 26:40.489
Boom, boom, boom!

26:43.746 --> 26:44.581
Oh!

26:44.873 --> 26:46.042
-[both laugh]
-[game tone chimes]

26:46.418 --> 26:47.253
[exclaiming]

26:51.302 --> 26:52.304
Oh!

26:52.430 --> 26:55.352
Eight! Aw!

26:59.068 --> 27:00.112
[guardian cheers]

27:00.195 --> 27:01.448
-[applauds]
-[Luke] All right!

27:01.657 --> 27:03.870
[whooping]

27:05.414 --> 27:06.584
[June] No one ever hears you?

27:07.293 --> 27:08.546
No one ever says anything.

27:09.213 --> 27:11.134
I think a lot of the guys have
little places they go.

27:11.301 --> 27:12.344
Just to get away.

27:15.727 --> 27:16.729
I'm glad you two are here.

27:19.025 --> 27:20.778
I usually have to run
down there and do it myself.

27:21.404 --> 27:22.616
It's a lot better
with someone else.

27:23.492 --> 27:25.747
All right. Watch it.
Guaranteed strike.

27:26.414 --> 27:27.834
[makes shooting sounds]

27:27.918 --> 27:29.170
[laughs]

27:31.174 --> 27:33.053
Ah, you know, I just...
I love bowling, so...

27:33.178 --> 27:34.848
[guardian] I think I did too.

27:35.934 --> 27:38.271
[chuckles] I think my dad
took me a few times.

27:39.858 --> 27:40.693
Before.

27:45.118 --> 27:46.037
You don't remember?

27:47.624 --> 27:49.836
Uh, everything from before
is, like, foggy.

27:51.089 --> 27:51.882
You know?

27:54.428 --> 27:55.389
Like a dream.

28:01.944 --> 28:02.779
So...

28:03.698 --> 28:04.616
Gilead's...

28:05.618 --> 28:06.829
that's all you know?

28:11.462 --> 28:12.298
Yeah.

28:14.468 --> 28:15.555
But it's not so bad.

28:18.226 --> 28:19.646
But you're working
to bring it down.

28:21.232 --> 28:23.111
People should just be able
to talk to each other.

28:25.032 --> 28:25.867
See their families.

28:28.581 --> 28:29.625
Do whatever they want.

28:30.835 --> 28:31.670
Like this.

28:35.177 --> 28:36.012
Yeah.

28:37.181 --> 28:38.016
Yeah.

28:41.607 --> 28:43.026
All right. [grunts]

28:48.913 --> 28:50.165
Can you believe this kid?

28:50.958 --> 28:53.463
I've never seen anyone in Gilead
who's pure like him.

28:53.673 --> 28:54.508
[guardian] All right.

28:58.014 --> 28:58.849
[Luke] Come on.

29:00.394 --> 29:01.479
-Again?
-[game tone chimes]

29:01.605 --> 29:04.820
Again? This... He's...
You're a pretty good bowler!

29:04.945 --> 29:05.780
-Hey, dude.
-[laughs]

29:05.863 --> 29:07.575
Hey, wait. Wait, wait.
What's your name?

29:08.243 --> 29:10.414
-Uh... Oh, I'm Jaeden.
-I'm Luke. Jaeden.

29:10.873 --> 29:12.292
-Nice to meet you.
-Me too.

29:13.671 --> 29:14.506
Nice to meet you both.

29:15.883 --> 29:17.010
It's nice to meet you, Jaeden.

29:18.471 --> 29:22.312
Oh, hang on. I, I almost forgot.
I have some beer in a cooler.

29:25.068 --> 29:25.903
Where'd he get beer?

29:26.739 --> 29:29.619
He's got beer in a cooler
because bowling and beer.

29:29.911 --> 29:31.582
-But where'd he get it?
-Now we need music.

29:32.584 --> 29:33.794
I don't think we need music.

29:36.466 --> 29:39.054
Yeah... Uh-oh!

29:40.767 --> 29:42.186
[playing "Yankee Doodle"]

29:43.856 --> 29:46.027
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

29:46.862 --> 29:47.697
Sorry about that.

29:47.906 --> 29:49.576
[plays random keys]

29:51.245 --> 29:52.791
[playing "O Susanna"]

29:56.339 --> 29:57.132
