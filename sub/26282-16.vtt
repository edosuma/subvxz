00:00.969 --> 00:03.677
- Previously on The Resident...
- You led me to believe

00:03.687 --> 00:05.590
that my arrogance killed my patient.

00:05.601 --> 00:08.557
It was a company
that makes defective valves

00:08.568 --> 00:09.786
and owns you.

00:09.797 --> 00:12.945
You've already lost a son, and
I want to do everything possible

00:12.956 --> 00:14.731
to ensure that doesn't happen again.

00:14.741 --> 00:18.499
With our VNS poster child,
Henry Barnett. Has he been admitted?

00:18.510 --> 00:20.019
Brought in with a possible seizure.

00:20.030 --> 00:23.079
The VNS is being featured at the
Innovation Summit tomorrow.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.032
If any issue comes up,
I want it handled.

00:25.043 --> 00:26.309
Quietly.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

00:37.037 --> 00:39.729
The QuoVadis device malfunctioned.

00:45.964 --> 00:48.005
Every three minutes

00:48.015 --> 00:50.975
it fired and stopped
Henry Barnett's heart.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.845
And each time,
we managed to bring him back,

00:54.855 --> 00:57.215
but it got harder and harder every time.

01:00.595 --> 01:04.087
Until Dr. Hawkins managed to
locate the programming wand...

01:06.033 --> 01:08.859
that deactivates the VNS.

01:12.907 --> 01:16.500
And the only reason
that Henry's alive...

01:16.510 --> 01:20.004
is because it malfunctioned
in the hospital.

01:20.014 --> 01:23.674
It's not the first time
a QuoVadis device has failed.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.285
A former resident died
from a defective heart valve.

01:26.296 --> 01:28.212
Which is why we're here.

01:28.223 --> 01:32.031
I've halted the use of all
QuoVadis devices at Chastain.

01:32.042 --> 01:33.358
We believe it's best

01:33.369 --> 01:36.589
to sever ties with Gordon Page
and his company immediately.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.948
As bad as this is, we're talking
about isolated incidents.

01:39.959 --> 01:41.942
All medical devices come with risk.

01:41.953 --> 01:44.735
QuoVadis insisted the VNS was safe.

01:44.746 --> 01:47.943
So far, our partnership with Gordon
Page has been a resounding success.

01:47.954 --> 01:49.816
Volume, revenue... they're both up.

01:49.827 --> 01:51.747
And let's not forget we
stand to make a killing

01:51.758 --> 01:53.983
from stock options
when QuoVadis goes public.

01:53.994 --> 01:56.687
When the truth comes out
that these devices kill people,

01:56.698 --> 01:58.757
there will be no IPO.

01:58.768 --> 02:01.107
There will, however, be lawsuits

02:01.118 --> 02:02.961
that could bankrupt this hospital.

02:02.987 --> 02:05.246
QuoVadis is hosting
an innovation summit today

02:05.257 --> 02:06.681
with investors coming from all over.

02:06.691 --> 02:09.618
Let's not rush to any conclusions.

02:09.628 --> 02:12.530
Randolph, you brought Gordon to us.

02:16.035 --> 02:18.035
Yeah, I did.

02:22.733 --> 02:24.743
And a child nearly died.

02:26.212 --> 02:29.847
And I cannot live knowing
we'd allow that to happen again.

02:32.852 --> 02:35.086
Can you?

02:38.782 --> 02:41.942
You're telling me the hospital
won't break with QuoVadis?

02:41.953 --> 02:44.679
Few things are harder
than making a large corporation

02:44.690 --> 02:46.982
renounce a profitable revenue stream.

02:46.993 --> 02:49.286
Bell didn't even try
to convince the board?

02:49.297 --> 02:51.889
Believe it or not,
Randolph did the right thing.

02:51.981 --> 02:55.241
Well, he'll turn on a dime
whenever it suits him.

02:55.252 --> 02:57.244
We can't count on him for anything.

02:57.255 --> 02:59.748
The court of public opinion
is our best shot now.

02:59.759 --> 03:01.484
Well, that's good.

03:01.495 --> 03:03.253
Zoey's furious.

03:03.264 --> 03:05.390
She's dying to talk
to the press about QuoVadis.

03:05.401 --> 03:07.226
Well, a statement to the press

03:07.237 --> 03:10.163
from a mother who almost lost
her child will go a long way.

03:10.174 --> 03:12.074
Keep me posted.

03:17.864 --> 03:21.224
Sergeant Jones served two tours.

03:21.234 --> 03:23.626
Fought bravely beside our men and women

03:23.636 --> 03:27.538
in the Kandahar Province and is
the recipient of a Purple Heart.

03:28.345 --> 03:31.004
But like so many of our brave soldiers,

03:31.014 --> 03:32.773
he has debilitating nightmares.

03:32.783 --> 03:35.776
The QuoVadis VNS has been approved

03:35.786 --> 03:40.113
to treat a range of conditions,
from epilepsy to depression.

03:40.123 --> 03:42.816
And now... PTSD.

03:42.834 --> 03:47.637
And it is going to end Sergeant
Jones's suffering for good.

03:49.099 --> 03:50.924
And he's not the only one we'll help.

03:50.934 --> 03:53.126
Later today, 20 more veterans

03:53.136 --> 03:57.497
like Sergeant Jones will receive
their very own QuoVadis VNS.

03:57.507 --> 03:59.499
And to show how simple

03:59.509 --> 04:02.969
and safe a cure can be,

04:02.979 --> 04:06.273
we will be streaming
these surgeries live

04:06.283 --> 04:09.876
from VA hospitals across the country.

04:21.673 --> 04:24.407
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:25.916 --> 04:28.729
Meanwhile, "Waaa!"

04:28.739 --> 04:30.630
"Who is that?"

04:30.640 --> 04:32.032
"It's Nic!"

04:32.042 --> 04:34.134
"Hey, Conrad! I came to help!"

04:34.144 --> 04:36.336
"Sure. Great."

04:36.346 --> 04:40.207
"Just because I wear
casual clothes does not mean

04:40.217 --> 04:42.250
I'm not a doctor!"

04:43.387 --> 04:45.479
Hey, buddy, how you feeling?

04:45.489 --> 04:47.347
Okay.

04:47.357 --> 04:48.849
He drew this.

04:48.859 --> 04:50.851
What?!

04:50.861 --> 04:53.587
Wow. Who is this?

04:53.597 --> 04:56.022
That's Nic. See the cape?

04:56.032 --> 04:59.359
Yeah, I see the resemblance.

05:00.562 --> 05:02.371
How you feeling?

05:02.382 --> 05:03.897
You need to get some rest.

05:03.907 --> 05:05.433
I'll be fine.

05:05.444 --> 05:09.603
You're gonna get to make that
statement about the VNS to the press.

05:09.613 --> 05:12.038
Hopefully today.

05:12.048 --> 05:14.107
I know you're concerned about Henry...

05:14.117 --> 05:16.243
I'll make time.

05:16.253 --> 05:19.246
I think I can get the reporters
to interview you here.

05:19.256 --> 05:22.215
All you have to do is tell
the truth about what happened.

05:22.225 --> 05:23.717
Of course.

05:23.727 --> 05:25.218
Is Henry gonna be all right?

05:25.228 --> 05:26.887
For now, yes.

05:26.897 --> 05:29.055
Eckart thinks
we should consider moving Henry

05:29.065 --> 05:31.625
to Duke University Hospital.

05:31.635 --> 05:34.342
And... I agree.

05:36.279 --> 05:40.434
Duke has a comprehensive program
for pediatric epilepsy

05:40.444 --> 05:42.402
with new surgical options.

05:42.412 --> 05:44.871
They're experimental,
but they're our best hope

05:44.881 --> 05:46.473
to get Henry off the meds.

05:46.483 --> 05:48.375
The issue is,

05:48.385 --> 05:52.446
most health insurance won't
cover experimental procedures.

05:52.456 --> 05:54.214
But don't worry.

05:54.224 --> 05:56.616
We will figure this out.

06:00.163 --> 06:01.655
You got to see this.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.323
Gordon Page is putting the VNS

06:03.333 --> 06:05.992
in 20 soldiers today to cure their PTSD.

06:06.002 --> 06:09.062
And 100 more will be implanted
over the next few weeks.

06:09.072 --> 06:11.131
There is no proof
that it's gonna do anything

06:11.141 --> 06:12.933
for PTSD. It might even kill them.

06:12.943 --> 06:14.601
The same way it almost killed Henry.

06:14.611 --> 06:16.102
Well, we have to stop this.

06:16.112 --> 06:18.071
Is the hospital coming out
against QuoVadis?

06:18.081 --> 06:20.507
No. But Zoey Barnett is.

06:20.517 --> 06:23.510
In an hour, she'll be on
all three local news channels.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.805
She's telling them
the VNS nearly killed her son.

06:25.816 --> 06:29.311
The optics here are a disaster,
and the timing couldn't be worse.

06:29.322 --> 06:32.018
- Where is she now?
- At Chastain with the child.

06:32.028 --> 06:35.058
Have the boy's seizures returned?
Is he on multiple drugs again?

06:35.069 --> 06:37.490
Dr. Bell isn't returning
our calls. We're in the dark.

06:39.636 --> 06:42.471
Get me everything there is
to know about her and the kid.

06:42.482 --> 06:43.581
Okay.

06:52.549 --> 06:54.696
Incision to close in two hours.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.843
- Nice work, Dr. Bell.
- Thanks, Paul.

06:56.853 --> 06:58.953
I'll check on Mr. Flynn in the ICU.

07:07.664 --> 07:09.890
You leave any blood in the patient?

07:09.900 --> 07:11.791
What'd you do? Saw him in half?

07:11.801 --> 07:14.661
A liver resection. You know
how the liver bleeds, Simon.

07:14.671 --> 07:16.796
Yeah, so I noticed.

07:17.458 --> 07:19.065
You in for scratchers this week?

07:19.075 --> 07:21.801
Oh, yeah,
I got a feeling today's the day.

07:21.811 --> 07:24.304
You've had that feeling before,
and how much have we lost

07:24.314 --> 07:26.116
- on the lotto already?
- The only reason

07:26.127 --> 07:28.808
why we haven't won the jackpot
yet is you're bad luck.

07:28.818 --> 07:31.177
Then why do you play with me?

07:31.187 --> 07:34.014
Oh, I got a soft spot for the ugly ones.

07:40.280 --> 07:41.953
You all right?

07:42.699 --> 07:45.025
Yeah. Getting old... it sucks.

07:45.035 --> 07:47.313
Guess it's better than the alternative.

07:47.324 --> 07:48.724
Let me see that.

07:51.741 --> 07:53.033
Your feet swollen, too?

07:53.043 --> 07:55.220
Ah, been eating too much salt lately.

07:55.231 --> 07:57.170
You've eaten too much salt
all your life. This is new.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.368
- I'd like to run a couple tests.
- And I'd like to have a date

07:59.379 --> 08:01.265
with a Rockette, but
that ain't gonna happen, either.

08:01.276 --> 08:03.409
Come on. You're already in a hospital.

08:04.521 --> 08:06.521
I'm gonna come and find you.

08:08.692 --> 08:10.758
Pain in the ass.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.108
Excuse us. Sorry. Where is he?

08:15.119 --> 08:16.456
Okay. Come on. Excuse me.

08:16.466 --> 08:17.958
Sorry. Excuse us.

08:17.968 --> 08:19.626
Excuse us.

08:19.636 --> 08:21.061
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hey, welcome.

08:21.071 --> 08:22.429
Can I get your, uh, name?

08:22.439 --> 08:24.264
Uh, Marilyn Spoelstra. I just...

08:24.274 --> 08:25.828
Oh! Okay.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.901
Here, let me get you a chair.

08:27.911 --> 08:29.803
Three hours in a hatchback.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.438
Wouldn't even let us stop and stretch.

08:31.448 --> 08:33.073
I raised a drill sergeant.

08:33.082 --> 08:34.774
Well, it wasn't some joyride, Ma.

08:34.784 --> 08:37.077
I was doing 75 to save your life.

08:37.087 --> 08:38.260
What brings you in today?

08:38.272 --> 08:40.614
Oh, just a little bit
of stomach pain. Comes and goes.

08:40.624 --> 08:42.739
Any past medical issues?

08:42.750 --> 08:46.586
Marilyn has diabetes, high
cholesterol, high blood pressure.

08:46.596 --> 08:50.056
She also has perfect pitch and
two majestic German shepherds.

08:50.066 --> 08:53.760
- Oh, just one. Phineas passed.
- No, not Mr. Phin.

08:53.770 --> 08:55.412
Wait. How do you guys know each other?

08:55.423 --> 08:56.630
Uh, we're from Cecil, Alabama.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.632
Dr. Shaw used to come
with his mobile clinic.

08:58.642 --> 09:00.600
Parked outside our church once a month.

09:00.610 --> 09:02.902
And Kay always made sure
that they were first in line.

09:02.912 --> 09:04.630
When you didn't show
two months in a row,

09:04.641 --> 09:06.840
I looked online,
saw you on Chastain's website.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.575
Her pain's never been this bad.

09:08.585 --> 09:10.076
Where exactly is the pain?

09:10.086 --> 09:11.645
It's over here.

09:11.655 --> 09:13.913
That's right upper quadrant.
Could be gallstones.

09:13.923 --> 09:15.949
Oh, God! And there it is again.

09:15.959 --> 09:17.817
We should probably get you to the ER.

09:17.827 --> 09:20.020
Uh, we have an ultrasound machine.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.455
Let's try to figure out
what's wrong here first.

09:26.503 --> 09:28.028
Is all this really necessary?

09:28.038 --> 09:31.831
Nothing's too good for Chastain's
longest-serving employee.

09:31.841 --> 09:34.334
Oh, can I get a '65 Mustang instead?

09:34.344 --> 09:36.591
You can buy it yourself.
You're winning that lottery.

09:36.602 --> 09:38.188
This is gonna be cold.

09:38.199 --> 09:40.109
O... kay.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.852
How have you been sleeping?

09:41.863 --> 09:45.712
Fine, when I'm in my recliner.

09:45.722 --> 09:48.648
But when I lie flat,
I feel like I'm drowning.

09:48.658 --> 09:50.950
And then, I've been
getting these chills.

09:50.960 --> 09:54.095
Chills? Since when?

09:54.106 --> 09:57.160
Mm... last Tuesday, I think.

09:57.171 --> 10:00.119
I hear you're Chastain's
unofficial historian.

10:00.130 --> 10:01.628
Keeper of secrets.

10:01.638 --> 10:03.454
Oh, I've seen a few things.

10:03.465 --> 10:05.799
I was here when Randolph was a resident.

10:05.809 --> 10:07.500
Keep in mind before you continue,

10:07.510 --> 10:09.736
that as CEO, I can fire you.

10:09.746 --> 10:12.505
I did not know
you did your residency here.

10:12.515 --> 10:14.574
Oh, he was as green as new mown grass.

10:14.584 --> 10:16.743
His first week,

10:16.753 --> 10:19.913
I'm putting supplies away,
and who do I find

10:19.923 --> 10:21.381
in a custodial closet?

10:21.391 --> 10:23.316
Young Randolph Bell.

10:23.326 --> 10:25.719
Yeah. He tried to play it off

10:25.729 --> 10:29.189
that he was lost,
but he wasn't the first resident

10:29.199 --> 10:31.157
I found hiding from his attending.

10:31.167 --> 10:33.367
You're fired.

10:41.268 --> 10:43.635
All right, spit it out, boys.

10:51.221 --> 10:53.179
That's not supposed
to be on my heart, is it?

10:53.189 --> 10:54.881
No.

10:54.891 --> 10:56.282
It's called a myxoma.

10:56.292 --> 10:59.018
It's probably been growing there
for months.

10:59.029 --> 11:00.920
Thing got so big, it started to block

11:00.930 --> 11:03.185
- the blood flow to your heart.
- Which explains

11:03.196 --> 11:06.192
the fluid buildup and pitting edema.
It's all signs of heart failure.

11:07.118 --> 11:08.977
The good news is

11:08.988 --> 11:10.964
we caught it early
while it's still operable.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.966
When Bell brought you in for testing...

11:12.976 --> 11:14.609
he probably saved your life.

11:16.079 --> 11:19.201
Well... I guess being friends with you

11:19.212 --> 11:21.212
finally did me some good.

11:24.845 --> 11:27.551
I'm not sure the myxoma explains
all of Simon's symptoms.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.554
- It was confirmed on the echo.
- Yeah, but there could be

11:29.564 --> 11:31.911
a coexisting condition, and
that would complicate surgery,

11:31.922 --> 11:33.781
so I'd just like
to run a few more tests.

11:33.791 --> 11:36.483
Delaying his tumor resection is
just gonna worsen his prognosis.

11:36.493 --> 11:38.652
But if there is something else going on,

11:38.662 --> 11:41.124
it would increase his risk
for perioperative complications.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.223
Yeah, okay. Yeah, fine. Run your tests.

11:43.233 --> 11:45.426
But I'm not gonna postpone
the surgery much longer.

11:45.436 --> 11:47.720
Well, barring any issues,
we'll still get it done today.

11:47.731 --> 11:48.763
Okay.

11:48.774 --> 11:50.666
How's Henry?

11:51.175 --> 11:52.967
Uh, well, his...

11:52.977 --> 11:55.602
heart's not stopping anymore.

11:55.612 --> 11:57.972
But he has a long road ahead.

11:58.613 --> 12:02.399
It happened because you told Zoey
the VNS was safe when it wasn't.

12:02.410 --> 12:04.198
You put profits over patients, again.

12:04.209 --> 12:07.580
I pulled all QuoVadis devices
as soon as I learned

12:07.591 --> 12:08.920
the VNS was flawed.

12:08.939 --> 12:11.150
Good for you. But Gordon Page

12:11.161 --> 12:13.491
is still putting patients
at risk, now more than ever,

12:13.502 --> 12:14.814
actually.

12:15.366 --> 12:18.492
I've done everything I can to stop him,

12:18.502 --> 12:20.995
and you have no idea
what I've sacrificed

12:21.005 --> 12:23.130
to protect patients from this man.

12:23.140 --> 12:24.498
He's coming for me next.

12:24.508 --> 12:27.024
So you save your morality lesson.

12:39.823 --> 12:42.024
I'll let you take that.

12:45.562 --> 12:47.051
Feeling a bit better?

12:47.062 --> 12:49.321
Yeah, thanks to your drugs.

12:49.332 --> 12:50.990
Are you single, honey?

12:51.001 --> 12:53.326
Kay's got a boyfriend,
but it isn't serious.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.362
- Ma, quit.
- Oh, you can fuss

12:55.372 --> 12:58.832
over me, but I don't get
to be involved in your life?

12:58.842 --> 13:00.521
I see gallstones.

13:00.532 --> 13:02.671
But there's no
gallbladder wall thickening.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.669
You're right,
no sign of acute cholecystitis.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.121
That's a good thing?

13:06.550 --> 13:08.175
Yes and no.

13:08.185 --> 13:10.177
We've controlled your flare-up today,

13:10.187 --> 13:12.746
but I think you'll need surgery
soon to remove your gallbladder.

13:12.756 --> 13:14.715
Well, let's do it now, get it over with.

13:14.725 --> 13:16.350
I can't take this pain much longer.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.352
That won't actually be possible here.

13:18.362 --> 13:21.171
You don't have insurance, and
Chastain is a private hospital.

13:21.182 --> 13:24.191
They're not gonna do that surgery unless
your situation is life-threatening.

13:24.201 --> 13:26.827
So I got to be dying to get some help?

13:26.837 --> 13:29.191
Well, who the hell made these rules?

13:29.202 --> 13:31.442
Well, we could refer you
to County to get it scheduled.

13:31.453 --> 13:32.653
They take uninsured patients.

13:32.664 --> 13:34.690
Typically, their wait list
is months long.

13:34.701 --> 13:37.703
Well, we can't wait here. Uh-uh.

13:37.714 --> 13:39.114
We got no place to stay.

13:39.125 --> 13:41.450
- We're gonna have to go home.
- You'd make her go home

13:41.461 --> 13:43.829
and suffer like this, for months, maybe?

13:43.840 --> 13:45.445
And what if she suddenly gets worse?

13:45.456 --> 13:47.214
You know what?
I have a friend at County.

13:47.224 --> 13:49.783
Let me reach out, see if they
can get her in right now.

13:49.793 --> 13:52.619
- All right, then.
- Thank you.

13:54.598 --> 13:56.934
You know, Bell told me about you.

13:56.945 --> 13:59.860
He said you are one
real pain in the ass.

13:59.870 --> 14:02.229
I'll take it. Pain-in-the-ass
people get things done.

14:04.274 --> 14:06.233
You know...

14:06.243 --> 14:09.236
when Randolph was young,
he was a lot like you.

14:09.246 --> 14:12.739
I remember his second year
as a resident.

14:12.749 --> 14:14.942
He got into a real shouting match

14:14.952 --> 14:17.077
with his chief of surgery.

14:17.087 --> 14:20.114
He wanted to stop doctors
from smoking in the hospitals.

14:20.124 --> 14:22.891
Said it was no good for anyone's health,

14:22.902 --> 14:24.596
patients or doctors.

14:24.607 --> 14:27.620
Everyone, they just thought
he was no fun.

14:27.631 --> 14:30.057
But... he was right.

14:30.067 --> 14:32.960
And eventually, they banned smoking.

14:32.970 --> 14:35.596
And the very next year...

14:35.606 --> 14:37.831
- he helped me quit.
- Oh, Bell,

14:37.841 --> 14:39.766
a reformer?

14:39.776 --> 14:41.676
That's hard to believe.

14:41.687 --> 14:44.671
This place has a way of changing people.

14:44.681 --> 14:46.607
Just wait.

14:46.617 --> 14:48.683
Change you, too.

15:02.599 --> 15:03.690
Hey.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.692
- Hey.
- You need anything?

15:05.702 --> 15:07.430
- No.
- You ready?

15:07.441 --> 15:09.530
Yes. I want to do this.

15:09.540 --> 15:11.532
Yeah, you're gonna be great.

15:11.542 --> 15:14.455
We'll be all set for you in
about ten minutes, Ms. Barnett.

15:14.466 --> 15:15.665
Thanks.

15:17.681 --> 15:19.367
I'll be with Henry until they need me.

15:19.378 --> 15:20.726
Yeah. Go.

15:22.186 --> 15:24.111
W-What's your favorite kind of game?

15:24.121 --> 15:25.979
On the story mode games,

15:25.989 --> 15:27.848
there's a bad guy that you have to stop

15:27.858 --> 15:29.483
with missions that connect

15:29.493 --> 15:31.018
- to each other.
- Oh.

15:31.028 --> 15:33.595
- And it's really cool.
- So you're hunting bad guys.

15:33.606 --> 15:36.456
- What are you doing here?
- Ms. Barnett.

15:36.466 --> 15:38.700
I came here to check in
on you and Henry.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.172
Mom, he gave it to me.

15:43.473 --> 15:45.025
Look, I understand that you're upset.

15:45.036 --> 15:47.737
I am, too.
That's why I'm here... to help.

15:48.745 --> 15:50.537
Hey.

15:50.547 --> 15:52.372
I was just coming to check in.

15:52.382 --> 15:54.041
What's going on?

15:54.051 --> 15:56.484
Mr. Page was just leaving.

16:05.027 --> 16:06.852
You all right?

16:06.863 --> 16:09.356
Yes.

16:09.366 --> 16:11.196
Well, they're ready for you.

16:11.207 --> 16:13.266
I'll stay with Henry.

16:13.277 --> 16:14.609
Thanks, Nic.

16:21.961 --> 16:25.238
Hear me out. Henry had
a very rare adverse event.

16:25.249 --> 16:26.900
Is that what you call it?

16:26.911 --> 16:30.344
Every new lifesaving device has
glitches in the first few years,

16:30.354 --> 16:32.529
and then we adjust and we learn.

16:32.540 --> 16:35.115
He's going to Duke. They'll help him.

16:35.125 --> 16:36.683
Now, please leave us alone.

16:36.694 --> 16:38.852
And who's paying
for his treatment at Duke?

16:38.862 --> 16:41.462
If the surgery is experimental,
insurance won't cover it.

16:41.473 --> 16:42.923
Will you be able to keep your job

16:42.934 --> 16:44.748
while you're with your
son in North Carolina?

16:44.759 --> 16:47.088
Without a job, will you
even have health insurance?

16:48.082 --> 16:50.532
- What do you want?
- Henry's condition is likely permanent.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.032
I'm here to tell you
that QuoVadis is willing

16:53.043 --> 16:56.470
to cover all his medical bills...
not for a month, not for a year...

16:56.480 --> 16:58.713
for his whole life.

17:01.551 --> 17:04.512
- I don't believe you.
- I'll put it in writing.

17:05.989 --> 17:07.936
It's the least we can do.

17:12.462 --> 17:15.255
And in return, I'm guessing...

17:15.266 --> 17:18.107
you don't want me
to go talk to the press.

17:19.435 --> 17:21.636
Don't make me your enemy.

17:22.682 --> 17:24.441
Take the offer.

17:24.607 --> 17:29.102
And if you go public with a grievance
against QuoVadis, now or ever...

17:30.180 --> 17:32.614
this deal goes away.

17:33.584 --> 17:35.984
We're ready for you now, Ms. Barnett.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.137
How much?

17:54.173 --> 17:56.973
How much was Page's offer?
I heard he was here.

17:56.984 --> 18:00.211
There were more zeroes than
I've ever seen in one number.

18:00.222 --> 18:01.681
You can't take it.

18:02.015 --> 18:05.296
We'll find another way to pay for
Henry's treatment, I promise you.

18:05.307 --> 18:07.120
- You can't promise that.
- Yes, I can.

18:07.131 --> 18:09.907
I do promise that.
Zoey, you need to speak out,

18:09.918 --> 18:11.743
or people will die if you don't.

18:11.981 --> 18:14.396
I get it, I get it... that
kind of money, it is tempting.

18:14.407 --> 18:16.460
Even all that money, it can't be enough

18:16.471 --> 18:18.496
to stop me from waking up every night

18:18.507 --> 18:20.454
and running into Henry's room
to make sure

18:20.465 --> 18:23.466
he didn't stop breathing. It won't...

18:26.433 --> 18:28.833
It won't bring his brother back.

18:33.550 --> 18:36.076
I signed already.

18:36.087 --> 18:38.888
QuoVadis wired the money.

18:39.779 --> 18:42.346
It's done.

18:43.560 --> 18:45.693
I am not a horrible person.

18:47.384 --> 18:49.643
I will help arrange...

18:49.653 --> 18:52.421
for Henry's transfer to Duke.

18:53.828 --> 18:56.600
We need to get him there
as quickly as we can.

18:57.413 --> 18:59.486
Thank you, Conrad.

18:59.574 --> 19:01.841
For everything.

19:03.901 --> 19:05.667
Good luck, Zoey.

19:14.311 --> 19:17.499
What about cancellations? There's
got to be some way to get her in.

19:18.851 --> 19:20.507
Okay, thanks, man.

19:20.517 --> 19:22.349
Nope. I understand.

19:23.812 --> 19:26.137
They wanted to schedule Marilyn's
surgery seven weeks out.

19:26.148 --> 19:27.481
I talked them down to three.

19:27.491 --> 19:30.017
- This isn't your fault.
- No, in a way, it is.

19:30.027 --> 19:33.026
The mobile clinic helped me stop
crises before they happened.

19:33.037 --> 19:34.659
I am sure that you encouraged Marilyn

19:34.670 --> 19:36.462
to live a healthier
lifestyle many times.

19:36.473 --> 19:38.459
I mean, there's only so much we can do.

19:38.469 --> 19:41.169
This is the situation,
so we have to deal with it.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.439
Okay, how?

19:46.128 --> 19:47.619
Where's your RV?

19:47.778 --> 19:50.041
- It's down the street.
- Pull it around.

19:50.059 --> 19:51.525
We're gonna have a working lunch.

19:55.052 --> 19:57.878
Welcome to Le Château Shaw.

19:57.888 --> 19:59.713
- Château what?
- Come on.

19:59.723 --> 20:03.484
You're mere steps from the best
medical care Atlanta has to offer.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.661
What on earth... ?

20:06.954 --> 20:09.056
- Oh, my.
- We provide our guests

20:09.066 --> 20:12.559
with the utmost privacy.

20:12.569 --> 20:15.525
Unfortunately, the pool's closed
for renovation indefinitely.

20:15.536 --> 20:16.783
Are you sure this is okay?

20:16.794 --> 20:18.751
It should be fine until
your mom has the surgery.

20:18.762 --> 20:20.754
And there's a supermarket
within walking distance.

20:20.765 --> 20:23.637
Yeah. And there's a kitchen in the
clinic... use it anytime you need.

20:23.647 --> 20:24.905
But...

20:24.915 --> 20:26.666
no more fatty foods.

20:26.677 --> 20:28.557
They'll only worsen your
gallbladder attacks.

20:28.568 --> 20:30.978
Listen to Dr. Shaw on this.
It's very important.

20:30.988 --> 20:32.413
No more peanut butter.

20:32.423 --> 20:34.515
No fried chicken.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.555
No chocolate, no dairy.

20:36.566 --> 20:38.739
And... definitely no more bacon.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.742
- Well, then what's left?
- Fruits,

20:40.753 --> 20:43.227
veggies, whole grains, lean protein.

20:44.835 --> 20:47.536
No bacon? Harsh.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.564
Mina said you're storming the castle.

20:52.575 --> 20:54.434
We're going.

20:54.445 --> 20:56.395
Bradley's dead. Julian is still missing.

20:56.406 --> 20:59.037
I'm not gonna just sit around while
Gordon keeps hurting patients.

20:59.048 --> 21:01.792
His Innovation Summit is open to the
public... we can walk right in.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.788
We need to get the truth about the
VNS to the military leaders there

21:04.799 --> 21:06.379
who can actually stop this thing.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.949
Wow. Leaking what
the VNS did to Henry...

21:08.959 --> 21:11.552
now, that would be a violation of HIPAA.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.620
Which is why we're removing

21:13.630 --> 21:15.864
anything that would reveal
the patient's identity.

21:19.405 --> 21:20.638
Go get 'em.

21:30.114 --> 21:32.873
One of my investigators
was able to locate

21:32.883 --> 21:34.586
a former QuoVadis employee

21:34.597 --> 21:36.810
who witnessed fraud at the company.

21:36.820 --> 21:39.146
- Will they come forward?
- No, they're afraid of Gordon.

21:39.156 --> 21:41.148
So we'll have to find proof ourselves.

21:41.158 --> 21:43.150
What proof?

21:43.160 --> 21:44.651
Zoey's out.

21:44.661 --> 21:46.553
The VNS surgeries are in a few hours.

21:46.563 --> 21:48.287
- We're running out of time.
- I know.

21:48.298 --> 21:50.491
I figured you'd be halfway
to QuoVadis by now.

21:50.501 --> 21:53.034
I can't leave. I got critical patients.

21:54.448 --> 21:56.138
There's one now.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.306
I got to go.

22:00.132 --> 22:02.936
He's not responding to fluid boluses.
Still hypotensive.

22:02.946 --> 22:04.338
You thinking cardiogenic shock?

22:04.348 --> 22:05.606
He's vasodilated.

22:05.616 --> 22:08.349
His fever just spiked to 103.
This is septic shock.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.325
Draw a lactate,
set up for a central line.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.614
We've already got blood cultures.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.595
Let's get him started
on vancomycin and cefepime.

22:15.606 --> 22:17.851
Hang norepinephrine
and titrate to a MAP of 65.

22:17.861 --> 22:18.952
Stay with us, buddy.

22:20.531 --> 22:22.931
I'm seeing Osler's nodes.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.458
Those splinter hemorrhages
weren't there two minutes ago.

22:31.469 --> 22:34.635
Cardiac mass must be infected.
It's not just a myxoma.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.603
He's got endocarditis as well.

22:36.613 --> 22:39.139
I've only seen two patients
with both in my entire career.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.208
And did they survive?

22:41.218 --> 22:42.317
One did.

22:47.019 --> 22:49.338
Well, at least his pressures
are starting to come back up.

22:49.349 --> 22:51.436
Obviously, under normal circumstances,

22:51.447 --> 22:54.763
we would recommend holding off on
surgery with such a recent infection.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.584
But with Simon's valve deteriorating

22:57.595 --> 23:00.470
and his heart failure worsening,
he needs it soon.

23:00.481 --> 23:02.640
His surgery just got
a whole lot riskier.

23:02.650 --> 23:05.476
Let's broaden his antibiotics to
cover any possible resistance.

23:05.486 --> 23:08.212
Do we still go forward?

23:08.222 --> 23:10.681
If he does nothing, he'll live

23:10.691 --> 23:12.550
for a couple more months.
Operating under

23:12.560 --> 23:15.553
these circumstances
might mean he never wakes up.

23:18.166 --> 23:19.961
I'll talk to him.

23:21.422 --> 23:23.502
It's his decision.

23:29.958 --> 23:31.636
This was all they had left.

23:31.646 --> 23:35.039
- Apparently, the word is out.
- You know, if I got sick,

23:35.049 --> 23:37.675
half this hospital
would pop a bottle of champagne.

23:37.685 --> 23:40.798
Why? The other half don't drink?

23:40.809 --> 23:42.312
Okay.

23:42.323 --> 23:44.557
So, how bad is it?

23:46.327 --> 23:48.586
Surgery's risky.

23:48.596 --> 23:50.814
Even in Austin's hands, uh...

23:52.033 --> 23:54.900
the odds of survival aren't great.

23:56.704 --> 24:00.031
What happens if AJ doesn't cut
this thing out of me?

24:00.041 --> 24:01.273
What then?

24:04.183 --> 24:07.104
Then the tumor will
completely obstruct your heart,

24:07.114 --> 24:09.106
and...

24:09.116 --> 24:10.908
you'll have a month,

24:10.918 --> 24:13.344
maybe two.

24:13.354 --> 24:16.581
Get your affairs in order.

24:16.591 --> 24:20.351
So my choices
are risking dying on the table

24:20.361 --> 24:21.419
or...

24:21.429 --> 24:23.696
start saying goodbye.

24:25.566 --> 24:27.299
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

24:31.105 --> 24:34.707
Want to take a day
and-and think about it?

24:35.710 --> 24:37.702
I'm a betting man.

24:37.712 --> 24:40.104
I've beaten long odds before.

24:40.114 --> 24:42.540
No.

24:42.550 --> 24:44.650
Let's do it.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.953
All right.

24:48.990 --> 24:51.423
All right.

24:53.995 --> 24:55.653
You know,

24:55.663 --> 24:57.288
I love my job.

24:57.298 --> 24:59.757
Pay's not great.

25:01.168 --> 25:03.160
But every day, I...

25:03.170 --> 25:05.730
get to help you save lives.

25:05.740 --> 25:08.599
And I sleep like a baby.

25:08.609 --> 25:11.636
Oh, it's been a while
since I slept through the night.

25:11.646 --> 25:16.407
You love this place as much as I do.

25:16.417 --> 25:21.453
I know you'll do whatever you
have to to make things right.

25:23.991 --> 25:25.591
Hey.

25:28.162 --> 25:30.496
You better get ready.

25:34.869 --> 25:36.627
The VNS stopped

25:36.637 --> 25:38.262
the patient's heart every three minutes.

25:38.272 --> 25:39.597
It's a miracle he survived.

25:39.607 --> 25:41.265
It nearly killed him.

25:41.275 --> 25:42.767
If you move forward with this,

25:42.777 --> 25:45.670
you are putting a ticking time
bomb in every one of these vets.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.104
I'm sorry, wh-who are you again?

25:47.114 --> 25:49.607
We're doctors who work at Chastain.

25:49.617 --> 25:51.776
The device is FDA-approved.

25:51.786 --> 25:53.844
But the FDA doesn't do
independent testing.

25:53.854 --> 25:55.846
And they're notorious
for grandfathering devices

25:55.856 --> 25:58.290
based on previous ones
that don't even work.

26:00.161 --> 26:02.887
We're satisfied with the trial data

26:02.897 --> 26:05.564
Gordon Page provided us.

26:11.739 --> 26:13.331
Look.

26:13.341 --> 26:15.333
That's Raptor's mentor,

26:15.343 --> 26:18.836
the one that recommended the
heart valve that killed Bradley.

26:18.846 --> 26:21.739
I don't suppose punching him
would do us any good, would it?

26:21.749 --> 26:23.474
Come on.

26:23.484 --> 26:25.910
May I have your attention, please?

26:25.920 --> 26:30.214
Our presentation will begin
shortly in the main lobby.

26:30.224 --> 26:32.917
Dr. Benedict, I'm Dr. Okafor.

26:32.927 --> 26:35.019
I met you with Dr. Austin.

26:35.029 --> 26:37.088
Yeah, who could forget?

26:37.098 --> 26:39.857
We're here because Gordon's VNS
is as deadly as his heart valve.

26:39.867 --> 26:41.525
And it's about to endanger
dozens of lives

26:41.535 --> 26:43.402
if we don't stop it.

26:44.839 --> 26:48.232
Give AJ my best.

26:48.242 --> 26:52.603
Dr. Benedict, you still have
a reputation to protect.

26:52.613 --> 26:54.505
If you know anything... No, no.

26:54.515 --> 26:56.841
The greatest betrayal of Austin's life

26:56.851 --> 26:58.843
was when his birth parents
abandoned him,

26:58.853 --> 27:01.412
throwing him away like trash.

27:01.422 --> 27:03.581
You were a close second.

27:03.591 --> 27:05.850
That's how much your friendship
meant to him.

27:05.860 --> 27:07.918
That's how much he trusted you.

27:07.928 --> 27:10.588
The man you used to be

27:10.598 --> 27:13.257
and the one you can be again.

27:13.267 --> 27:15.259
When Mina said the VNS will fail,

27:15.269 --> 27:16.869
you weren't surprised. Why?

27:18.706 --> 27:20.431
I didn't have a choice.

27:20.441 --> 27:22.867
We had to get the device to market.

27:22.877 --> 27:26.103
- You and Gordon?
- I swear...

27:26.800 --> 27:29.468
- I didn't know at first.
- Know what?

27:41.204 --> 27:42.637
Let's take a walk.

27:54.821 --> 27:58.269
Your pre-op numbers look
quite reassuring, my brother.

27:58.279 --> 28:01.639
Once that tumor's removed, we'll see
about finding you that Rockette.

28:03.284 --> 28:06.777
Ah, I thought I'd seen this room
from every angle.

28:07.604 --> 28:10.656
But I've never seen it like this.

28:11.927 --> 28:14.084
Okay, transfer on three.

28:14.094 --> 28:15.879
One, two, three.

28:20.468 --> 28:23.101
Starting the propofol.

28:24.104 --> 28:25.496
Randolph.

28:25.506 --> 28:26.931
Yeah.

28:26.941 --> 28:29.274
Try not to make a mess.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.450
She's on the floor.

28:45.461 --> 28:47.130
It looks real bad.

28:49.645 --> 28:52.251
- The pain usually goes away.
- And it's gotten worse.

28:55.219 --> 28:57.128
We need to get her to Chastain.

28:57.139 --> 29:00.100
Marilyn, one of your gallstones
is now causing an infection.

29:00.111 --> 29:02.118
It's a good thing
you didn't head back to Alabama.

29:02.129 --> 29:04.169
This could've happened
on the road, with nowhere to go.

29:04.179 --> 29:06.138
Ultrasound shows pericholecystic fluid.

29:06.148 --> 29:08.540
And her white count is
at 20,000. No fever.

29:08.550 --> 29:10.735
I'm Dr. Nolan. I'll be removing
your gallbladder today.

29:10.746 --> 29:12.238
Oh, hallelujah.

29:12.249 --> 29:15.147
- Don't usually get that reaction.
- You can take it out now?

29:15.157 --> 29:16.348
Now it's an emergency.

29:16.358 --> 29:17.549
Get her prepped for surgery.

29:17.559 --> 29:18.992
I'll see you in the OR, okay?

29:22.364 --> 29:24.577
I can't thank you enough.

29:25.334 --> 29:27.159
Whatever you've done,

29:27.169 --> 29:28.682
it is not too late to make it right.

29:28.693 --> 29:30.028
- Talk to us.
- What do you know?

29:30.039 --> 29:32.506
What has QuoVadis done?
How can we stop this?

29:45.187 --> 29:47.513
I want to talk to AJ.

29:47.523 --> 29:49.181
He deserves the truth.

29:49.191 --> 29:51.391
Just him, not you.

29:52.728 --> 29:54.100
All right.

30:14.750 --> 30:18.449
Here we have the QuoVadis
vagus nerve stimulator.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.714
All cities are online.

30:21.724 --> 30:25.384
The surgeries are about to begin.

30:25.394 --> 30:28.729
Dr. Stevenson presiding.

30:34.103 --> 30:36.830
The patient is David Jones.

30:36.841 --> 30:39.531
Date of birth 8/6/1989.

30:39.541 --> 30:42.201
Procedure to be performed
is surgical implantation

30:42.211 --> 30:44.431
of a vagus nerve stimulator.

30:44.442 --> 30:46.809
Let's begin. 10 blade.

30:52.279 --> 30:54.047
I can't reach Austin.

30:54.058 --> 30:55.390
I've called three times.

30:57.259 --> 30:58.984
He's in surgery.

30:58.994 --> 31:00.958
- What is going on?
- Abe doesn't trust us.

31:00.969 --> 31:02.386
He'll only talk to Austin.

31:02.397 --> 31:04.490
He knows something that can help.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.933
I'm on it.

31:16.558 --> 31:18.670
All right, let's start rewarming Simon

31:18.680 --> 31:20.606
and get his heart pumping again.

31:20.616 --> 31:21.907
Defib paddles to me.

31:21.917 --> 31:23.742
Charge to ten joules.

31:25.020 --> 31:27.020
Clear.

31:33.462 --> 31:35.059
He's in V-fib.

31:35.262 --> 31:37.726
Give 300 of amio and try again.

31:50.813 --> 31:53.313
I'm here. I'm here.

31:55.117 --> 31:56.775
And clear.

32:03.079 --> 32:05.017
He won't stay out of V-fib.

32:05.027 --> 32:06.699
His electrolytes are normal.

32:06.710 --> 32:08.854
I've given him more magnesium,
but it's not doing anything.

32:08.864 --> 32:10.222
Get the intracardiac epi ready.

32:10.232 --> 32:13.500
Just worried his heart sustained too
much damage during the procedure.

32:15.804 --> 32:17.396
Injecting one milligram

32:17.406 --> 32:19.298
of epi.

32:36.658 --> 32:38.058
I can't get to him.

32:39.061 --> 32:41.186
You have to.

32:41.196 --> 32:43.555
I can't. His patient could die.

32:48.604 --> 32:50.662
Let's get him on a balloon pump.

32:50.672 --> 32:52.064
Charge to 20.

32:52.075 --> 32:53.374
Clear.

33:00.660 --> 33:03.750
Come on, Dr. Benedict, please,
tell us whatever you know.

33:12.027 --> 33:13.557
Where's the balloon pump?!

33:17.733 --> 33:18.986
General?

33:19.534 --> 33:21.293
My name is Marshall Winthrop.

33:21.303 --> 33:24.263
I'm chairman of the board
at Chastain Park Memorial.

33:24.273 --> 33:27.170
We'll be cutting ties with QuoVadis

33:27.181 --> 33:28.867
because of some information

33:28.877 --> 33:30.610
I thought you'd be interested in seeing.

33:31.618 --> 33:33.921
Don't you understand
that lives are at stake here?

33:35.978 --> 33:37.542
Please.

33:37.552 --> 33:39.319
- Come on.
- Let's go.

33:40.673 --> 33:42.839
Come on.

33:52.768 --> 33:55.068
Mr. Page wants to speak with you.

33:57.005 --> 33:58.964
QuoVadis is engaged

33:58.974 --> 34:00.966
in wide-ranging fraud.

34:00.976 --> 34:04.436
All of their devices, including the VNS,

34:04.446 --> 34:06.605
are being shipped in from China

34:06.615 --> 34:09.886
and then relabeled as made in the USA.

34:09.897 --> 34:14.283
By law, the military cannot use any
medical device not American made.

34:14.293 --> 34:16.514
And those are shipping records

34:16.525 --> 34:18.266
over the last few months.

34:18.277 --> 34:20.879
You have more proof there
than you'll ever need.

34:44.317 --> 34:45.842
What happened?

34:45.853 --> 34:50.023
What happened is the U.S. military
partnered with a liar and a fraud.

34:51.059 --> 34:54.052
Our contract is now null and void.

34:54.062 --> 34:56.328
All surgeries are canceled.

35:36.878 --> 35:40.480
Austin said Simon's heart was too weak.

35:41.509 --> 35:45.644
There is nothing anyone could have done.

35:59.527 --> 36:02.027
He would have hated this.

36:42.937 --> 36:45.938
What did you tell them?

36:47.308 --> 36:49.308
I didn't tell them anything.

36:50.945 --> 36:52.986
I wouldn't do that to you.

36:56.884 --> 36:58.198
Good.

36:59.153 --> 37:01.453
I knew I could count on you.

37:03.348 --> 37:05.744
We have some storm clouds ahead.

37:06.460 --> 37:09.929
But we will weather it
if we all stick together.

37:11.933 --> 37:13.933
Talk tomorrow.

37:35.790 --> 37:38.616
Hey. I hear Marilyn's out of surgery.

37:38.626 --> 37:40.251
Yeah, it went great.

37:40.261 --> 37:42.353
Uh, Nolan did it laparoscopically,

37:42.363 --> 37:44.188
so she and Kay get to go home
in the morning.

37:44.198 --> 37:45.590
Great.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.158
It smells good. What is that?

37:47.168 --> 37:50.258
Eight piece, extra crispy,
with a side of crunchy.

37:50.269 --> 37:52.269
And a milkshake.

37:54.942 --> 37:56.582
Everything we told her not to eat.

37:56.593 --> 37:59.770
She didn't forget our advice. She
knew exactly what she was doing.

37:59.780 --> 38:01.872
She just took matters
into her own hands.

38:03.150 --> 38:05.176
She gave herself a gallbladder attack

38:05.186 --> 38:08.012
to get surgery right away.

38:08.022 --> 38:10.418
What's wrong with a hospital system

38:10.429 --> 38:12.984
when patients have to put
their own lives in jeopardy

38:12.994 --> 38:15.461
just to get access to treatment?

38:18.499 --> 38:21.292
I, uh, was thinking
about what you said earlier.

38:21.302 --> 38:24.870
Made me wonder
if you regret taking this job.

38:25.906 --> 38:28.199
Well, it's complicated.

38:28.209 --> 38:30.201
No. I mean, I get it.

38:30.211 --> 38:33.638
We're saving people from drowning.

38:33.648 --> 38:35.648
You want to teach them to swim.

38:39.342 --> 38:41.545
Look, you got us up and running.

38:41.555 --> 38:44.256
I understand if you want
to go back on the road.

38:45.259 --> 38:46.917
Yeah, you know, I may.

38:46.927 --> 38:49.353
But, uh...

38:49.363 --> 38:53.190
You know why I stay, don't you?

38:54.333 --> 38:56.333
You're here.

39:00.741 --> 39:02.374
We make a great team.

39:04.245 --> 39:06.111
Yes, we do make a great team.

39:08.023 --> 39:11.216
But it feels like maybe
there's something more.

39:15.723 --> 39:19.750
Um, it's late. I'm gonna take
this stuff home to wash it,

39:19.760 --> 39:22.728
- and I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah. Okay.

39:26.734 --> 39:28.734
Good night, Alec.

40:49.550 --> 40:51.550
It's done.

41:10.838 --> 41:13.063
Well done.

41:13.073 --> 41:15.800
Well, the investigators
came through just in time.

41:15.810 --> 41:17.802
It was a team effort.

41:17.812 --> 41:19.970
And the board?

41:19.980 --> 41:22.740
I've already canvassed them all.

41:22.750 --> 41:24.070
We're out.

41:25.419 --> 41:27.378
Is QuoVadis finished?

41:27.388 --> 41:30.014
It was a big financial blow.

41:30.024 --> 41:32.716
But they have hard assets.

41:32.726 --> 41:35.219
So if they find an angel investor

41:35.229 --> 41:36.687
to get them back on their feet

41:36.697 --> 41:38.124
and pull them out of this mess...

41:38.135 --> 41:40.201
Well, then we have to deliver
a death blow.

41:41.035 --> 41:43.035
We'll find one.

41:51.492 --> 41:54.038
You saved more lives than I did today.

42:17.638 --> 42:21.279
It's a big shock today for the
Atlanta-based QuoVadis Corporation.

42:21.290 --> 42:24.101
The medical device manufacturer suffered

42:24.111 --> 42:27.137
a very public rejection
of its hottest new device,

42:27.147 --> 42:28.980
the vagus nerve stimulator,

42:28.991 --> 42:31.774
or, as it's better known, the VNS.

42:31.785 --> 42:34.144
QuoVadis CEO and founder Gordon Page

42:34.154 --> 42:35.587
had orchestrated a l...

42:51.171 --> 42:55.499
Gordon. This is Marshall Winthrop.

42:55.509 --> 42:57.668
Oh, what do you want?

42:57.678 --> 42:59.636
Twist the knife?

42:59.647 --> 43:01.456
Just the opposite.

43:01.916 --> 43:05.175
Do you know how I made my fortune?

43:05.185 --> 43:08.779
By taking over companies
on the verge of collapse.

43:08.789 --> 43:13.191
And making millions
for everyone involved.

43:13.979 --> 43:16.046
We should talk.
