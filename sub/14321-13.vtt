00:01.333 --> 00:03.708
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:01.208 --> 01:03.250
What is it you fear?

01:03.250 --> 01:07.166
WOLVERINE: Myself. It's like
I don't know who I am any
more.

01:07.166 --> 01:08.583
Why now?

01:08.583 --> 01:11.000
I don't know. If I knew,
I'd handle it.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.500
Is it because of Proteus?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.583
Don't make me bust you up.

01:18.750 --> 01:22.083
Hey! Stop it!
Make it stop!

01:22.083 --> 01:24.750
No! No more!

01:26.125 --> 01:27.416
(SCREAMING)

01:32.416 --> 01:34.000
(SOBBING)

01:34.000 --> 01:36.083
No, I worked through that.

01:36.208 --> 01:40.583
Did the revelation of your
Weapon X brainwashing
distress you?

01:41.125 --> 01:43.166
SCIENTIST: Despite
initial setbacks,

01:43.166 --> 01:45.291
all subjects are responding
to the trauma conditioning.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.291
We will be able to
reintegrate them
into society

01:47.291 --> 01:49.583
with no memory that
we conditioned them.

01:49.708 --> 01:52.333
The key is to reach
the subconscious mind.

01:53.458 --> 01:56.125
When their covert
services are needed,

01:56.125 --> 01:59.708
they will
attack their target
and then remember nothing.

01:59.708 --> 02:01.458
WOLVERINE:
I got a lot
of memories, Doc.

02:02.625 --> 02:05.166
So what if a few
of them ain't real?

02:10.708 --> 02:11.708
(GROWLING)

02:16.333 --> 02:19.166
What's wrong, punk?

02:22.708 --> 02:25.166
Can't take care of
your woman?

02:25.166 --> 02:27.875
Your woman...
Your woman...

02:27.875 --> 02:29.375
Is it about Jean?

02:29.375 --> 02:31.458
You can't have her!

02:32.500 --> 02:33.500
(GRUNTING)

02:36.583 --> 02:37.833
Jean.

02:38.583 --> 02:40.166
Wolverine.

02:40.166 --> 02:42.125
No, she's happy.

02:42.125 --> 02:44.083
I love
her enough to want
her to stay that way.

02:44.083 --> 02:47.125
When you first came here,
you were wild and confused,

02:47.125 --> 02:48.958
out of control.

02:48.958 --> 02:50.208
(GROWLING)

02:51.583 --> 02:54.583
You learned to
harness your rage,
as you found a home here.

02:58.208 --> 03:01.208
Yet I sense
you are no happier.

03:01.208 --> 03:03.250
What are you afraid
that you will do?

03:03.250 --> 03:06.500
When I used
to go berserk,
I was an animal.

03:07.166 --> 03:09.583
I had no direction,
no purpose.

03:09.583 --> 03:13.208
You and the others gave me
a reason to fight,
or back off.

03:13.208 --> 03:15.000
It's not there any more.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.166
Logan!
Consider what
you're saying.

03:17.166 --> 03:19.833
I wanted to
waste a kid
today!

03:19.833 --> 03:21.750
For cutting me
off in traffic!

03:22.416 --> 03:23.458
(TIRES SQUEALING)

03:28.458 --> 03:30.708
I even came close
to hurting Jubilee!

03:30.708 --> 03:34.750
And it didn't bother me.
I didn't care, Professor.

03:34.750 --> 03:37.166
Even animals
care about each other.

03:37.166 --> 03:42.125
I don't know
what's missing inside.
I got no idea how I lost it.

03:42.125 --> 03:45.166
But there's one place
I might be able to
get it back.

03:45.166 --> 03:48.291
I'm going to Japan.
I'm leaving the X-Men.

03:54.708 --> 03:55.583
(TAXI HORN HONKING)

03:59.000 --> 04:01.625
Open your heart, Herr Logan.

04:01.625 --> 04:06.250
Would it hurt so
much to see the world
through different eyes?

04:06.250 --> 04:07.875
Wish I could, pal.

04:07.875 --> 04:09.125
(LAUGHING)

04:09.125 --> 04:11.625
But my eyes
see me too well.

04:12.375 --> 04:13.958
Your taxi's here.

04:15.875 --> 04:18.000
Why do you
have to leave?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.500
Don't you get it?
I didn't care what
happened to that kid!

04:20.500 --> 04:22.583
I didn't care
what happened
to you!

04:22.583 --> 04:24.166
The professor
helped you before.

04:24.166 --> 04:26.625
He'll do it again!
We'll all help!

04:26.625 --> 04:30.375
Thanks, kid. But right now,
I'm not fit to be one of
the X-Men.

04:34.416 --> 04:36.708
WOLVERINE:
There's a place
I was happy once.

04:36.708 --> 04:40.000
A simple world,
where I knew
how to live.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.875
Maybe I can find
what I'm looking
for there.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.625
OKU: Yokoso,Logan-san.

04:48.291 --> 04:52.833
Though many years have passed,
I have been expecting your
return.

04:52.958 --> 04:55.166
Domo,Master Oku.

04:55.708 --> 04:57.708
I see you're not done
with your new temple.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.333
We do what we can.

04:59.875 --> 05:03.000
Using
those tools, you're gonna
be doing it for a long time.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.708
We have nowhere to go.

05:04.708 --> 05:06.708
There is no hurry.

05:06.708 --> 05:09.708
Feels like
I've been in a hurry
ever since I left Japan.

05:09.708 --> 05:11.708
Mind if I pick up
where I left off?

05:11.708 --> 05:13.583
It would be an honor.

05:17.708 --> 05:20.000
(GRUNTING)

05:20.000 --> 05:24.708
Perhaps building the temple
will aid you in rebuilding
your soul.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
(BELL RINGING)

05:50.000 --> 05:51.958
The workday is over.

05:51.958 --> 05:53.708
I ain't tired.

05:53.708 --> 05:55.708
The villagers
have prepared
a feast tonight.

05:55.708 --> 05:58.708
It would
dishonor them to
keep them waiting.

06:08.708 --> 06:12.625
They don't
seem too friendly.
What, did I step on a duck?

06:12.625 --> 06:15.291
They are curious,
Logan-san.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.875
You are different.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.750
This is Logan-san.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.458
He works with us
building the temple.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.208
Logan, this
is Yoshida-san,
the village elder.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.291
We have seen you
working at the temple.

06:29.291 --> 06:34.083
If Master Oku
has welcomed you,
we can do no less.

06:34.750 --> 06:38.416
Kisara! Show
Logan-san to the table.

06:38.416 --> 06:42.833
Konichiwa,Logan-san.
My name is Kisara.

06:42.833 --> 06:43.833
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

06:48.750 --> 06:49.750
(ENGINE REVVING)

06:51.000 --> 06:52.583
Who's Evel Knievel?

06:52.583 --> 06:55.583
He is my brother, Soichi.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.833
He has a wild spirit.

06:57.833 --> 06:59.875
My condolences.

06:59.875 --> 07:02.625
You should have been with
the fishing fleet this
morning.

07:02.625 --> 07:06.833
I have been training the few
who have the courage to
fight our enemies!

07:06.833 --> 07:11.416
You know this is forbidden!
We will do what we have
always done.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.750
We will pay.
No! This time we...

07:14.750 --> 07:16.708
Show some respect
for your elders, kid.

07:16.708 --> 07:19.416
I only respect
those who earn it!

07:20.583 --> 07:24.000
You're right, kid.
I was wrong to interfere.

07:24.125 --> 07:28.291
Coward!
Go back to the temple
and hide from the world!

07:28.833 --> 07:32.833
It is often the braver man
who chooses not to fight.

07:40.875 --> 07:42.958
JUBILEE:
Dear Professor Xavier,

07:42.958 --> 07:44.875
I don't know
why Wolverine left.

07:44.875 --> 07:47.583
But I know
he's unhappy
and he's alone.

07:47.583 --> 07:51.000
I peeked at
his personal file
and it took a while,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.875
but I think I know
where he went in Japan.

07:53.875 --> 07:57.958
I have to try to help him,
or I'd never forgive myself.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.750
I know
you'll understand.

08:01.375 --> 08:02.375
(GRUNTING)

08:04.333 --> 08:07.708
We need more timbers
for the temple roof,
Logan-san.

08:07.708 --> 08:09.458
I will get them, Master Oku.

08:10.458 --> 08:12.000
Do you not need a saw?

08:12.166 --> 08:13.875
And spoil the fun?

08:18.083 --> 08:20.250
Timber!

08:23.458 --> 08:26.875
Dareda,mutant.
What are you
doing here?

08:26.875 --> 08:29.458
The name's Logan,
and I'm cutting trees.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.166
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

08:31.166 --> 08:33.500
I am called
Silver Samurai.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.500
The people of this province
know to fear me.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.875
Perhaps I will learn, too.

08:38.875 --> 08:41.125
Let me give you
some advice, gaijin.

08:41.125 --> 08:44.166
Stay out of matters
that do not concern you.

08:44.166 --> 08:46.333
Not that it's any
of your business,

08:46.333 --> 08:48.583
but that's just
what I had in mind.

08:49.625 --> 08:51.583
An excellent decision.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.333
May you live to
benefit from it.

08:56.833 --> 08:59.458
Somehow I don't
think he's local.

08:59.583 --> 09:00.708
(MOTORCYCLES APPROACHING)

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
We are here
to remind you

09:08.000 --> 09:12.291
that the tribute you owe
Silver Samurai is due in
three days.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.958
It has been a bad year
for our village.

09:14.958 --> 09:17.000
We can scarcely
feed ourselves.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.708
(CHUCKLES)

09:18.708 --> 09:21.958
Silver Samurai
cannot eat your excuses.

09:21.958 --> 09:24.166
Have the tribute
ready in three days!

09:24.166 --> 09:28.333
No! The thieving will stop!
We will not pay your
extortion!

09:30.875 --> 09:32.583
Soichi!

09:32.583 --> 09:35.708
Peasant!
You will pay
dearly for that!

09:35.708 --> 09:38.875
No, Takaki. We do
not need a martyr.

09:38.875 --> 09:41.208
You disappoint me, Yoshida.

09:41.208 --> 09:44.958
You should have better
control of your villagers.

09:44.958 --> 09:49.083
We return in two days,
and the payment will
be doubled.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.125
Leave them a reminder.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.458
Smoke, coming from the temple!

10:02.000 --> 10:03.875
Master Oku is
trapped inside!

10:08.000 --> 10:09.416
Master Oku!

10:14.125 --> 10:16.125
Master Oku.

10:16.125 --> 10:19.333
I hope you're not upset if
we don't stick around to chat.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.833
Is Master Oku all right?

10:24.833 --> 10:27.125
How did this happen?

10:27.125 --> 10:29.583
Each year the Silver Samurai
demands tribute
from all the villagers.

10:29.583 --> 10:32.208
-If we do not pay...
-I get the picture.

10:32.208 --> 10:35.458
The old protection racket,
samurai style.

10:35.583 --> 10:39.000
This year we have
no money to pay.
We are fishermen.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
They will
destroy our village!

10:43.000 --> 10:44.583
It never ends.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.958
Logan-san,
you must help.

10:57.958 --> 11:01.208
Soichi is trying to
organize the people
to fight the bandits.

11:01.208 --> 11:04.375
Dameda,Kisara. I'm sorry.

11:04.375 --> 11:06.875
I came to find myself,
not to fight.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.625
But the villagers
are not trained
as fighters.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.250
We have no weapons.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.625
What would Master Oku say,
Kisara?

11:13.625 --> 11:17.958
He would say that no
worldly possession are worth
the risk of one's life.

11:17.958 --> 11:20.000
So tell that
to the villagers.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.250
But Master Oku
would also say that
inner peace is found,

11:23.250 --> 11:27.583
not by avoiding conflict,
but in serving your true
nature.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.416
My true nature.

11:31.208 --> 11:33.708
Huh,
I wish I knew what that was.

11:35.375 --> 11:40.000
Wolverine. You sure
you haven't seen him?

11:40.583 --> 11:44.458
He used to hang out
here with an Oku guy.

11:45.833 --> 11:46.958
Great.

11:47.750 --> 11:51.833
And, if the fishmongers dare to
fight back, destroy them!

11:51.958 --> 11:53.708
(ALL CHEERING)

11:53.708 --> 11:56.500
One small village,
what does it matter?

11:56.500 --> 11:58.583
Each village that fears us

11:58.583 --> 12:01.708
is a link in the chain
that keeps them under
our control.

12:01.708 --> 12:04.708
If one resists,
the chain is broken.

12:04.708 --> 12:08.083
Better to
crush one village,
to set an example,

12:08.083 --> 12:10.208
than let the
chain be broken.

12:10.208 --> 12:15.583
Silver Samurai is evil!
This time, we fight back!

12:16.583 --> 12:18.708
This is foolish, Soichi!

12:18.708 --> 12:22.500
We are farmers and fishermen,
no match for armed fighters!

12:22.500 --> 12:26.750
Better to die
defending ourselves
than to live in fear!

12:26.750 --> 12:31.416
Since I was a child,
I have watched our
people work hard,

12:31.416 --> 12:35.333
only to
have these criminals
take what little we earned!

12:35.333 --> 12:38.500
Our children shall
not suffer as we have!

12:39.708 --> 12:42.875
Go back and hide
with the monks,
gaijin.

12:42.875 --> 12:45.000
I don't hide
from anybody,
kid.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.083
I'm fighting my
own battle right now.

12:47.708 --> 12:50.250
But you're right.

12:50.250 --> 12:53.500
Either you stand and fight,
or you'll be kissing their
backsides forever.

12:53.500 --> 12:56.166
-OK! No more tribute!
-We will fight!

12:56.166 --> 12:58.083
Is this how
you repay us?

12:58.083 --> 13:00.750
By helping bring destruction
to our village?

13:01.708 --> 13:04.708
-No more tribute!
-VILLAGER 1: No more tribute!

13:04.708 --> 13:07.875
-VILLAGER 1: No more tribute!
-VILLAGER 2: No more tribute!

13:31.833 --> 13:35.291
You are
trying to decide
how to act tomorrow.

13:35.291 --> 13:37.583
They're gonna be
slaughtered, Master Oku.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.333
Possibly.

13:39.333 --> 13:41.291
I came here to get
away from fighting!

13:41.291 --> 13:44.750
I want to be like you!
I just want to live in peace!

13:44.750 --> 13:48.000
Do you?
Peace comes with purpose.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.416
My faith gives me mine.

13:50.416 --> 13:52.458
Ripping up people
is no purpose!

13:52.458 --> 13:56.333
But protecting
and caring for people is.

13:56.833 --> 14:02.375
Like many, perhaps you see
yourself less well than
others see you.

14:03.291 --> 14:07.375
Try looking at yourself
through new eyes.

14:07.375 --> 14:11.291
Master Oku,
I want to so much, I...

14:25.250 --> 14:30.250
I am afraid that
you will go, and I will
never see you again.

14:30.708 --> 14:36.333
I promise,

We used to be old pals,
even work together.

14:51.208 --> 14:55.750
But we had some
little misunderstandings.

14:55.750 --> 15:00.875
Yeah, right. He wasted
some friends of mine,
for no reason.

And I misunderstood.

15:03.583 --> 15:06.250
Come on, pops.
Let's go! Run for it!

you're expendable!

No!

much to see the world
through different eyes?

Look deeper, Logan-san.

no one else.

16:44.291 --> 16:48.708
Perhaps you mighty warriors
wish to attack me instead!

We all fight

17:10.708 --> 17:13.875
It seems you have
rediscovered yours.

come with us!

to ask me twice!

do as well against

You're fighting the wrong guy,

Just trying out one of

Works pretty good.

-Finish him, Logan-san!
-I ought to, he's earned it.

But there's no need
for that now, kid.
You stood up to him.

she is your friend, Logan-san.

I heard there
was a former X-Man
in the neighborhood.

19:53.708 --> 19:56.500
Guess I felt
I had something
to do with him going.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.833
My leaving was
never your fault, kid.

I had to do.

ain't my job.

20:29.125 --> 20:31.458
So, what did I miss?

20:31.458 --> 20:33.708
Who were the biker boys
and the big doofus with
the shiny metal outfit?

20:33.708 --> 20:36.625
And who's the babe?
Sounds like you two
got pretty friendly.

what a tough time
I had trying to find you?
