WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:02.152
My baby!

00:02.153 --> 00:03.740
Back up, back up!

00:10.633 --> 00:12.593
If she's alive, finish her!

00:14.273 --> 00:15.551
She's a goner!

00:18.100 --> 00:20.807
The transport contained heroin with
a street value of ten million.

00:20.808 --> 00:23.487
ED905's back in the hands
of Organised Crime.

00:23.488 --> 00:24.607
Nice work, lads.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.900
The hijack required inside information.

00:28.848 --> 00:31.687
Vihaan Malhotra, Civilian Administrator.

00:31.688 --> 00:33.167
Down! Stay down!

00:33.168 --> 00:35.047
I know what you're up to.

00:35.048 --> 00:36.487
What are we up to, Vihaan?

00:36.488 --> 00:38.380
Protecting one of your own.

00:40.888 --> 00:43.660
What is your relationship
with Vihaan Malhotra?

00:44.008 --> 00:45.607
He's my cousin, Ma'am.

00:45.608 --> 00:48.247
I never knew it was so bad,
what Vihaan was doing,

00:48.248 --> 00:50.620
otherwise I'd never have
gone along with it.

00:52.688 --> 00:55.647
You are finished with the Force,
and that's only the start of it.

00:55.648 --> 00:59.660
Christ knows what criminal charges
you're going to end up facing.

01:04.528 --> 01:07.847
I passed information to ACC Hilton.

01:07.848 --> 01:11.447
He was the senior police officer
who was running the show

01:11.448 --> 01:13.167
for Organised Crime.

01:13.168 --> 01:16.528
Killing himself was the only
decent thing that man ever did.

01:19.008 --> 01:24.847
I am deeply sorry for having not
consulted you about the finances.

01:24.848 --> 01:26.847
I'm a married man.

01:26.848 --> 01:28.380
Separated.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:37.328 --> 01:39.927
It's called Operation Pear Tree.

01:39.928 --> 01:42.367
Our brief was to embed
an undercover officer

01:42.368 --> 01:44.287
within an organised crime group.

01:44.288 --> 01:46.728
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.807
I'm in a rush.
Let's just swap insurance...

01:57.088 --> 01:59.967
There's only one thing worse
than a bent copper,

01:59.968 --> 02:03.087
that's a bent copper who pretends
she isn't.

02:03.088 --> 02:05.128
Shut up, this ain't helping!

02:42.648 --> 02:43.808
That's her.

02:46.161 --> 02:47.401
Yeah.

02:48.448 --> 02:50.688
Sorry. It can't have been easy.

02:55.568 --> 02:57.447
I'll stick around for
forensic examination

02:57.448 --> 02:59.088
- and report back to the boss.
- OK.

03:01.647 --> 03:03.287
You recognise this place, yeah?

03:08.748 --> 03:09.788
Yeah.

03:15.540 --> 03:19.820
Assistant Chief Constable Hilton's
body, as found in 2017.

03:20.648 --> 03:22.220
Assumed to be suicide.

03:23.088 --> 03:25.168
Now looking more possible he was killed.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.487
Maneet was complicit
in Hilton's corruption,

03:28.488 --> 03:30.100
killed in the same location.

03:31.648 --> 03:34.260
Maybe she knew something
and had to be silenced.

03:35.088 --> 03:37.727
I really wanted to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

03:37.728 --> 03:40.620
I hate to say it, I think she was
more involved than we thought.

03:40.968 --> 03:43.607
I mean, you work right beside someone...

03:45.328 --> 03:46.991
- Sir.
- Sir.

03:47.580 --> 03:48.927
It's an awful business.

03:48.928 --> 03:50.500
Awful business.

03:50.928 --> 03:52.367
Does the family know yet?

03:52.368 --> 03:54.220
Yes, sir. They're rallying round.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.288
What's going to happen
to those poor wee children?

03:59.008 --> 04:02.128
Do we know anything of Maneet's
movements prior to this?

04:04.248 --> 04:06.848
Shot by a bystander on his smartphone.

04:12.728 --> 04:14.447
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, God.

04:14.448 --> 04:16.406
- What's going on?
- What are they doing to her?

04:16.408 --> 04:17.822
- Are you getting this?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:17.848 --> 04:20.048
Keep filming. Keep filming!

04:22.728 --> 04:25.127
Serious Crime are running
ID on the suspects.

04:25.128 --> 04:27.847
They're running ANPR on the vehicle
to try and track its movements.

04:27.848 --> 04:29.607
And, what,
we're going to sit on our hands

04:29.608 --> 04:31.807
while Serious Crime run
the whole shooting match?

04:31.808 --> 04:33.140
I don't think so.

04:40.128 --> 04:41.168
Sir.

04:51.968 --> 04:53.420
Ma'am?

04:53.768 --> 04:55.807
PCC's asked to be in on this meeting.

04:55.808 --> 04:57.927
We've not met, have we,
Superintendent Hastings?

04:57.928 --> 04:59.807
Rohan Sindwhani.

04:59.808 --> 05:01.527
I know who you are, Mr Sindwhani.

05:01.528 --> 05:04.647
Then you'll know
I was elected to shake things up.

05:04.648 --> 05:07.927
Deputy Chief Constable Wise
knows my feelings on this subject.

05:07.928 --> 05:11.087
For too long, the extent of police
corruption has been covered up

05:11.088 --> 05:14.347
- for fear of losing public trust.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.807
And that is why in my department,
AC-12, we're determined to get

05:16.808 --> 05:18.927
to the bottom of it, we're the
best in the business.

05:22.688 --> 05:25.247
My senior legal counsel, Gill Biggeloe.

05:25.248 --> 05:27.208
You don't mind if she sits in?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.620
No.

05:30.208 --> 05:32.967
You were intending to brief me
on your inquiry's findings

05:32.968 --> 05:34.927
regarding the hijack?

05:34.928 --> 05:36.127
Yes, Ma'am, that's correct.

05:36.128 --> 05:41.767
But it's even more complex,
and more troubling,

05:41.768 --> 05:42.927
than we first thought.

05:42.928 --> 05:46.807
The OCG, that's the Organised Crime
Group, may be implicated

05:46.808 --> 05:51.087
in the death of a former AC-12
officer, PC Maneet Bindra.

05:51.088 --> 05:54.567
And we're also investigating
an undercover operation,

05:54.568 --> 05:56.328
Operation Pear Tree.

05:57.448 --> 05:59.127
- Pear Tree?
- Yes.

05:59.128 --> 06:03.087
We require access to all the files
pertaining to Operation Pear Tree

06:03.088 --> 06:05.359
in order to investigate the possibility

06:05.360 --> 06:08.647
that a serving undercover officer
may be participating

06:08.648 --> 06:10.500
in criminal activities.

06:12.335 --> 06:13.528
My God!

06:14.768 --> 06:18.007
I'm also here to ask the DCC
for access to Serious Crime's

06:18.008 --> 06:20.807
investigation of the
suspicious death of PC Bindra.

06:20.808 --> 06:23.429
There's a point of principle
with respect to a police unit

06:23.430 --> 06:26.727
investigating an offence in which
one of your former officers

06:26.728 --> 06:28.540
is the victim.

06:29.048 --> 06:32.887
Granted, Ma'am, granted,
but unless my officers have access

06:32.888 --> 06:36.660
to all the lines of inquiry,
we simply cannot do our job.

06:43.608 --> 06:48.180
Andrea, I'd be grateful
if you'd take the pragmatic view.

06:52.288 --> 06:55.727
AC-12 will have access
to Operation Pear Tree

06:55.728 --> 06:58.127
and to Serious Crime's investigation.

06:58.128 --> 07:00.728
Thank you, Ma'am. You won't regret it.

07:07.328 --> 07:09.967
That's the problem
with corruption inquiries.

07:09.968 --> 07:12.208
There's always the danger
you'll find some.

07:14.848 --> 07:16.687
DI Fleming, AC-12.

07:16.688 --> 07:19.696
We have the lawful authority to
investigate Operation Pear Tree.

07:19.697 --> 07:21.247
All officers to your desks.

07:21.248 --> 07:24.247
You'll each be questioned
by an AC-12 caseworker.

07:24.248 --> 07:26.847
You'll each be obliged to surrender
all materials relating to

07:26.848 --> 07:29.647
Operation Pear Tree to said case worker.

07:29.648 --> 07:32.887
Failure to comply will be a breach
of your Duties and Responsibilities

07:32.888 --> 07:34.607
under Police Conduct Regulations

07:34.608 --> 07:38.487
and may lead to a misconduct charge
under said regulations.

07:38.488 --> 07:41.847
What the hell's going on?
Our work here is confidential.

07:41.848 --> 07:43.767
DC Eldwick. Is this your desk?

07:43.768 --> 07:46.287
No files will be surrendered
without my say so.

07:46.288 --> 07:49.247
Ma'am, you're obstructing police
officers in their lawful duty which,

07:49.248 --> 07:52.408
as you know, is a criminal offence,
rendering you subject to arrest.

07:54.781 --> 07:55.981
Phillip.

07:57.888 --> 08:00.287
PC Yacoob. Take me to your desk, please.

08:00.288 --> 08:01.928
Box 23219.

08:13.928 --> 08:15.487
These are the most significant items

08:15.488 --> 08:18.527
that have been shared from Serious
Crime's search of Maneet's address.

08:18.528 --> 08:20.740
Audio files on a home computer.

08:23.515 --> 08:25.475
I think you need to hear this one first.

08:28.288 --> 08:33.527
I'm making this audio file
via a miniature recording device.

08:33.528 --> 08:38.299
My plan is to carry out undercover
surveillance on the OCG.

08:39.048 --> 08:44.807
I let AC-12 down. I betrayed
Superintendent Hastings' trust.

08:44.808 --> 08:46.928
This is how I'm going to make up for it.

08:50.128 --> 08:52.500
End of recording.

08:55.408 --> 08:56.448
My God.

08:58.768 --> 09:00.447
I feel awful now.

09:00.448 --> 09:01.620
Me too.

09:04.888 --> 09:06.940
OK. So what else have we got?

09:07.688 --> 09:09.088
Then there was this.

09:11.168 --> 09:13.100
You checked her over?

09:13.808 --> 09:16.927
No weapons, no recording devices.

09:16.928 --> 09:18.047
She's clean.

09:18.048 --> 09:19.768
So what's all this about?

09:22.248 --> 09:26.220
No other female voices on the
recordings, only Maneet's and hers.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.527
So where's DS John Corbett in all this?

09:30.528 --> 09:31.980
Nowhere.

09:32.368 --> 09:33.848
He's still a mystery.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.807
Was it really necessary to leave
her body down at the harbour?

09:49.808 --> 09:51.567
Could have just dumped it
in the landfill.

09:51.568 --> 09:53.327
The police would have been
none the wiser.

09:53.328 --> 09:54.847
Now here's what I don't understand.

09:54.848 --> 09:57.247
We've netted gear worth ten million quid,

09:57.248 --> 09:59.007
we've put a rival unit out of business

09:59.008 --> 10:01.847
and no bastard's even
picked up the phone.

10:01.848 --> 10:04.340
Oi, you! No good.

10:06.328 --> 10:09.287
Now, we've got a good thing
going on here with this unit, Lise.

10:09.288 --> 10:12.740
With a bit more support from above,
we could do some serious business.

10:13.888 --> 10:17.060
The boys have fallen for all this
cos you've got brains.

10:17.408 --> 10:20.700
But you're what? Less than a year in.

10:21.808 --> 10:23.767
I've earned my place.

10:23.768 --> 10:26.300
I follow orders.
That's the way you do business.

10:27.048 --> 10:30.167
In case you haven't noticed, Lise,
we don't do a nine to five,

10:30.168 --> 10:32.247
and we don't work
in some shitty little office

10:32.248 --> 10:34.567
waiting for some idiot boss
to tell you what to do,

10:34.568 --> 10:36.860
hoping you get thrown a crumb
every now and again.

10:37.648 --> 10:39.447
I've had my fill of that.

10:39.448 --> 10:41.727
Money, power, respect,

10:41.728 --> 10:43.648
that's what I'm in this for.

10:45.768 --> 10:47.408
And I reckon you are, too.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.580
You, very good.

10:50.888 --> 10:53.287
But quicker. Faster.

10:53.288 --> 10:55.647
Money! Money, money, money!

10:55.648 --> 10:59.968
My plan is to carry out
undercover surveillance on the OCG.

11:01.168 --> 11:06.008
I let AC-12 down. I betrayed
Superintendent Hastings' trust.

11:07.008 --> 11:09.528
This is how I'm going to make up for it.

11:12.168 --> 11:13.808
End of recording.

11:16.448 --> 11:17.848
Thank you. Thank you.

11:28.768 --> 11:30.940
Can I have your attention, please?

11:32.448 --> 11:34.380
We've lost one of our own.

11:35.888 --> 11:37.620
PC Maneet Bindra.

11:38.928 --> 11:42.940
Young officer,
mother with two young children.

11:45.128 --> 11:48.528
If you've ever asked yourself
the reason why we do this job...

11:51.874 --> 11:52.914
...this is it.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.128
Carry on.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.448
- Sir.
- Sir.

12:00.688 --> 12:02.620
Tatleen, the, er...

12:03.128 --> 12:05.247
...the Red Notice that we
served on Maneet Bindra,

12:05.248 --> 12:06.767
has it been actioned yet?

12:06.768 --> 12:09.528
No, sir. Her Fed Rep launched
an appeal and we were just...

12:09.553 --> 12:10.448
Yes.

12:10.449 --> 12:11.968
Yes. Rescind it.

12:13.128 --> 12:16.527
I shall talk to DCC Wise
and remind her that

12:16.528 --> 12:18.887
Maneet Bindra was still
a serving AC-12 officer

12:18.888 --> 12:20.808
at the time of her murder.

12:22.261 --> 12:24.341
She died in the line of duty.

12:40.288 --> 12:41.728
Superintendent Hastings?

12:43.168 --> 12:44.647
DCI Mark Moffatt.

12:44.648 --> 12:45.887
Well, retired DCI.

12:45.888 --> 12:48.927
Sorry to ambush you like this.
You're not an easy man to find.

12:48.928 --> 12:51.407
Oh, yeah, Roz Huntley's Fed Rep.

12:51.408 --> 12:53.647
- Listen, mate, it's been a long day...
- Yeah.

12:53.648 --> 12:57.447
Let me just spit it out and then
you can tell me to sling my hook.

12:57.448 --> 13:00.327
Since retiring, I've joined a mate's
property development business,

13:00.328 --> 13:02.967
and one of our new projects
is in the Republic of Ireland,

13:02.968 --> 13:04.688
the Kettle Bell Complex.

13:05.728 --> 13:08.407
- I'd rather not discuss that...
- We've taken over redevelopment,

13:08.408 --> 13:12.420
and our terms of business include
compensating the original investors.

13:14.248 --> 13:17.727
I've got the right man?
You were one of the unlucky ones?

13:17.728 --> 13:18.848
Yeah.

13:19.928 --> 13:22.168
Maybe I can take you for a drink?

13:23.968 --> 13:26.727
Yeah, wait there. I'll be right back.

13:26.728 --> 13:27.768
Sure.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.447
Thank you, Steve.

13:49.448 --> 13:50.528
Thank you, sir.

13:52.008 --> 13:56.367
Operation Pear Tree commenced
on 22nd January 2018

13:56.368 --> 14:00.247
under the command of Detective
Superintendent Alison Powell,

14:00.248 --> 14:02.927
with authority to embed
an undercover officer

14:02.928 --> 14:04.820
in an organised crime group.

14:05.168 --> 14:06.847
What we've now learned

14:06.848 --> 14:10.087
is the objective of Operation
Pear Tree was to investigate

14:10.088 --> 14:13.167
institutionalised links between
corrupt police officers

14:13.168 --> 14:14.367
and organised crime.

14:14.368 --> 14:18.727
An operation on our patch
and no-one told us a dickybird, eh?

14:18.728 --> 14:21.087
DS John Corbett.

14:21.088 --> 14:25.167
One year ago, John Corbett
left his desk and never went back.

14:25.168 --> 14:27.207
His colleagues were never
told where he went,

14:27.208 --> 14:29.567
and ordered never to disclose
he'd worked with them.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.847
His files were erased from
the police database,

14:31.848 --> 14:35.607
his phone number and e-mail deleted,
his name removed from the payroll.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.567
What we now know from these files

14:37.568 --> 14:40.488
is that Corbett was given
a new identity...

14:41.808 --> 14:46.620
...John Clayton,
a forger with multiple convictions.

14:47.448 --> 14:50.927
DS Corbett had been a printer
before he joined the Force.

14:50.928 --> 14:54.047
As Clayton, he offered his services
to the highest bidder.

14:54.048 --> 14:56.887
Files seized yesterday
reveal Clayton succeeded

14:56.888 --> 14:59.327
in convincing an OCG to recruit him,

14:59.328 --> 15:02.207
and he soon became a trusted member
of the OCG,

15:02.208 --> 15:04.167
responsible for overseeing the production

15:04.168 --> 15:06.567
of lucrative forgeries
of identity documents,

15:06.568 --> 15:11.327
legal documents, invoices, receipts,
certificates, you name it.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.620
Ma'am.

15:13.048 --> 15:16.407
Operation Pear Tree files show that
DS Corbett has been out of contact

15:16.408 --> 15:19.327
with his COM and Cover Officer
for nearly three months.

15:19.328 --> 15:21.727
In that time, he's believed to have
actively participated

15:21.728 --> 15:23.367
in criminal offences,

15:23.368 --> 15:27.007
namely the hijack of Seized Goods
Transport ED905,

15:27.008 --> 15:28.807
the murder of three AFOs,

15:28.808 --> 15:30.607
the attempted murder of a fourth

15:30.608 --> 15:33.340
and possibly even the death
of Maneet Bindra.

15:36.768 --> 15:38.927
This is an image of the vehicle
used to abduct Maneet,

15:38.928 --> 15:41.527
captured by a member of the public
who witnessed the incident.

15:41.528 --> 15:42.887
Now, using ANPR,

15:42.888 --> 15:45.847
we've been able to track the vehicle
heading towards Edge Park,

15:45.848 --> 15:47.047
but the trail ran out,

15:47.048 --> 15:50.220
leaving us unable to determine
the vehicle's destination.

15:50.728 --> 15:53.087
But from the same set of images,

15:53.088 --> 15:56.448
we were able to capture a clear
image of one of Maneet's abductors.

15:58.048 --> 16:01.247
Recognition software gives
a 90% likelihood the subject

16:01.248 --> 16:06.700
is Lee Banks, a career criminal with
numerous convictions for violence.

16:07.168 --> 16:10.648
One of Banks's known associates
is Robert Denmoor.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.607
Forensic evidence linked Denmoor
to OCG interference

16:14.608 --> 16:19.408
into Operation Trapdoor,
led by DCI Roz Huntley in 2017.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.486
You'll all recall that Denmoor
was shot dead in this building

16:23.487 --> 16:25.040
by the gaffer.

16:25.065 --> 16:27.567
What all this means is
there's a proven association

16:27.568 --> 16:30.367
between Corbett's OCG
and the network of corrupt officers

16:30.368 --> 16:32.247
we've been investigating all these years.

16:32.248 --> 16:34.447
And is there anything in the files
that might suggest

16:34.448 --> 16:35.887
why Corbett's gone rogue?

16:36.500 --> 16:39.087
We've been looking specifically
at the time leading up to the point

16:39.088 --> 16:41.807
where Corbett ceased contact
with his COM.

16:41.808 --> 16:44.260
The entries have been
redacted from the files.

16:45.368 --> 16:47.380
Thank you, Steve. Kate.

16:48.288 --> 16:53.207
So your orders are to establish
the whereabouts of John Corbett

16:53.208 --> 16:55.767
and to apprehend him without delay.

16:55.768 --> 16:56.900
Sir.

17:03.848 --> 17:07.166
Ma'am, about those redacted entries,

17:07.167 --> 17:09.406
the current COM on Operation
Pear Tree was appointed

17:09.407 --> 17:11.047
after Corbett stopped responding.

17:11.048 --> 17:12.727
I've got a name for the original COM,

17:12.728 --> 17:15.308
- and Tatleen's trying to track her down.
- Good.

17:16.248 --> 17:17.700
Look, Kate...

17:18.768 --> 17:21.207
...Corbett's embedded in a group
of hardened criminals

17:21.208 --> 17:23.967
who'd execute him if they
discover his true identity.

17:23.968 --> 17:26.166
I've been there. It's not nice.

17:26.167 --> 17:29.847
All I'm saying is he's
anti-corruption, same as us.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.047
Should we consider the lengths
he might be forced to

17:32.048 --> 17:34.047
- to maintain his cover?
- Sure.

17:34.048 --> 17:35.568
For about two seconds.

17:48.088 --> 17:51.248
Long way north. I'm surprised
it hasn't given you a nosebleed.

17:55.168 --> 17:57.687
- I didn't get no biscuits in.
- We're fine, thanks.

17:57.688 --> 18:00.327
As I explained over the phone,
Mrs Corbett, we're a specialist

18:00.328 --> 18:02.207
anti-corruption unit making inquiries

18:02.208 --> 18:04.047
into serious criminal offences.

18:04.048 --> 18:05.967
I've been a copper's wife long enough

18:05.968 --> 18:07.260
to know what anti-corruption means.

18:07.928 --> 18:10.247
You reckon John's involved.

18:10.248 --> 18:12.247
We're keeping an open mind.

18:12.248 --> 18:15.008
Steph... Is it OK if I call you Steph?

18:16.408 --> 18:18.247
I've been an undercover officer myself,

18:18.248 --> 18:21.247
so I do understand the stresses
your husband's under.

18:21.248 --> 18:23.940
We need to form a picture
of his current state of mind.

18:24.488 --> 18:26.127
I can't help you.

18:26.128 --> 18:27.967
I haven't heard from him.

18:27.968 --> 18:29.887
Don't expect to neither.

18:29.888 --> 18:31.540
Why do you say that?

18:31.968 --> 18:33.407
Ask her.

18:33.408 --> 18:35.287
She was undercover.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.647
Perfect job for a selfish arsehole
that don't give a toss

18:37.648 --> 18:39.220
about his own family.

18:41.368 --> 18:43.287
John's done undercover operations before.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.367
What's different about this one,
do you think?

18:45.368 --> 18:47.287
I'll tell you what's different.

18:47.288 --> 18:48.807
Nothing.

18:48.808 --> 18:50.927
He gets to run around
like he's single again,

18:50.928 --> 18:54.127
and I'm left with a house to run
and two kids to bring up.

18:54.128 --> 18:56.368
You've come hoping
I can help you find him?

18:58.834 --> 19:00.300
I don't want to find him.

19:11.528 --> 19:14.060
- Not too late?
- No. Just right, ta.

19:15.208 --> 19:18.927
Look, what Corbett's missus
said about undercover work,

19:18.928 --> 19:20.647
that was never you?

19:20.648 --> 19:23.420
Thanks, Steve, but she was right.

19:23.728 --> 19:27.420
I mean, getting promoted
and working new hours,

19:27.848 --> 19:29.727
it's given me a chance to make up
for all that.

19:29.728 --> 19:32.607
I'm just glad me and Mark are
making a go of things again

19:32.608 --> 19:34.540
and I can be a proper mum.

19:35.488 --> 19:37.448
- I'm glad for you, mate.
- Thanks.

19:38.848 --> 19:41.647
Your turn next... to settle down!

19:41.648 --> 19:43.567
Yeah, right.

19:43.568 --> 19:44.888
- Night, mate.
- Night.

19:56.288 --> 19:57.807
Hey.

19:57.808 --> 19:59.700
- Perfect timing.
- Oh, great.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.528
Hey, you all right?

20:03.768 --> 20:05.578
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

20:05.603 --> 20:06.780
Love you.

20:07.168 --> 20:09.100
I'll see you in the morning.

20:09.568 --> 20:11.248
- Night.
- Night-night.

20:18.408 --> 20:21.927
Vihaan explained to me
how he made contact with the OCG.

20:21.928 --> 20:25.767
There's a phone box in Moss Heath,
on the corner of Tates Avenue.

20:25.768 --> 20:27.807
They put a business card
in there that looks like

20:27.808 --> 20:29.607
it's for sexual services.

20:29.608 --> 20:32.487
The number keeps changing,
but the name's always the same,

20:32.488 --> 20:34.287
Nikki 9.

20:34.288 --> 20:36.807
You go through a series of set phrases.

20:36.808 --> 20:40.527
You start with, "Got a tip for you,"
like you're talking to a gambler.

20:40.528 --> 20:43.447
Then you quote the odds as "100 to 300".

20:43.448 --> 20:47.207
No matter what they say back,
you stick with those odds.

20:47.208 --> 20:49.447
Then either they give you
instructions for a meeting

20:49.448 --> 20:51.688
or drop off a burner phone.

20:53.808 --> 20:55.247
Hello?

20:55.248 --> 20:56.887
What do you want?

20:56.888 --> 20:58.527
Got a tip for you.

20:58.528 --> 21:00.127
Not interested.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.407
Decent odds.

21:01.408 --> 21:02.607
100-30.

21:02.608 --> 21:04.380
You taking the piss or what?

21:04.968 --> 21:06.460
100-30.

21:09.288 --> 21:10.380
Wait there.

21:54.968 --> 21:56.008
Yes!

22:10.088 --> 22:12.848
Hey, guys. Come and have a look at this.

22:23.568 --> 22:24.687
You know him?

22:24.688 --> 22:27.327
Copper. Steve something.

22:27.328 --> 22:30.020
Arnold. Dunno.

22:31.048 --> 22:32.055
Is he bent?

22:32.080 --> 22:34.180
Far as I can remember,
couldn't be straighter.

22:37.140 --> 22:39.140
You did the right thing, lads.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.820
We already fell for it once with Maneet.

22:42.541 --> 22:44.381
We're not the mugs they think we are.

22:44.837 --> 22:45.824
Nice one.

22:45.849 --> 22:47.112
- Cheers, John.
- No worries.

22:50.128 --> 22:53.407
For Christ's sake, John.
He's investigating Maneet's murder.

22:53.408 --> 22:54.767
Let's get a move on, then.

22:54.768 --> 22:57.127
- What do you mean?
- I've got a plan.

22:57.128 --> 22:58.620
Something big.

22:59.008 --> 23:02.048
Let's make use of our assets
before this muppet gets to them.

23:19.048 --> 23:20.367
Hi.

23:20.368 --> 23:23.980
District Nurse here to see Jane Cafferty.

23:24.688 --> 23:26.327
Oh, er...

23:26.328 --> 23:29.327
Sorry, the hospital's rubbish
at notifying people.

23:29.328 --> 23:31.847
He's checking. I just need
to carry out an assessment

23:31.848 --> 23:34.189
to make sure everything's
in place with her mobility,

23:34.190 --> 23:36.767
dressings, medication, etc.

23:36.768 --> 23:37.847
That's fine.

23:37.848 --> 23:41.567
Jane's still in a bit of pain.
It'd be good if you could see her.

23:41.568 --> 23:42.608
Standing by.

23:44.808 --> 23:47.007
Maybe I should try again tomorrow.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.500
It's all good. Go in.

23:57.481 --> 23:58.521
This way.

24:03.768 --> 24:06.447
Sorry, are you all right
to give us bit of...

24:06.448 --> 24:08.927
Yes, of course, some privacy.

24:09.180 --> 24:10.220
Thanks.

24:17.728 --> 24:20.860
Hello, Jane. I'm Alice.

24:21.728 --> 24:24.447
I need to start by asking you a few
questions, if that's all right.

24:24.448 --> 24:26.380
Am I OK to call you Jane?

24:30.208 --> 24:33.887
You shot me. You killed my team.

24:33.888 --> 24:36.008
I swear to God if I wasn't
in this bed, I'd...

24:37.168 --> 24:40.167
We crossed you, Jane,
but it weren't my idea.

24:40.168 --> 24:41.820
My family.

24:42.208 --> 24:43.688
They're safe.

24:46.248 --> 24:48.980
No-one's planning to finish
the job on you.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.180
I'm here to talk business.

24:52.088 --> 24:54.260
No. No. I've done my bit.

24:55.328 --> 24:56.368
Lovely husband.

24:57.808 --> 24:59.100
Lovely kids.

25:01.008 --> 25:03.607
Their safety was your first thought,

25:03.608 --> 25:06.940
but there's other ways that
you could lose them, Jane...

25:08.968 --> 25:10.288
...as we both know.

25:20.648 --> 25:22.487
Did you get what we need?

25:22.488 --> 25:24.967
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

25:24.968 --> 25:26.927
This is good.

25:26.928 --> 25:28.300
Maybe.

25:50.768 --> 25:54.140
They're on the move, John,
but they've upped security.

25:56.048 --> 25:57.367
How much?

25:57.368 --> 26:00.167
Four escort vehicles, 12 AFOs.

26:00.168 --> 26:03.100
We're outnumbered.
Maybe we should call it off.

26:04.008 --> 26:05.460
No. We'll just have to cope.

26:10.448 --> 26:12.727
Right, lads. They're on their way.

26:12.728 --> 26:15.447
So remember, do exactly as I told you.

26:15.448 --> 26:16.715
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:16.740 --> 26:19.608
All right. Let's go, let's go! Come
on, let's go! Let's move. Let's go!

26:36.968 --> 26:38.487
Go, go, go, go, go!

26:38.488 --> 26:39.528
Come on!

27:02.648 --> 27:05.047
Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

27:12.608 --> 27:13.888
Stay down. Get down.

27:17.448 --> 27:19.248
Multiple gunmen firing on us.

27:30.128 --> 27:32.568
Get out! Get out now!

27:36.608 --> 27:39.980
We have ARVs en route.
They'll be with you soon.

27:44.128 --> 27:45.500
What the hell are you doing?

27:47.368 --> 27:49.207
He was going to shoot you!

27:49.208 --> 27:51.420
Come on, Lee, let's go!

27:53.368 --> 27:55.847
Go! Move! Move!

27:55.848 --> 27:57.208
Go, go, go!

28:07.448 --> 28:08.688
Go, go, go!

28:33.768 --> 28:36.288
Very nice.

28:42.328 --> 28:44.768
Drinks are on me, lads.

29:02.368 --> 29:04.887
Keep me updated on traffic reports
and Air Ops.

29:04.888 --> 29:07.568
A convoy of vehicles can't
just vanish into thin air.

29:10.048 --> 29:11.344
Thanks for the call.

29:11.940 --> 29:14.070
I thought you lot were meant to be
leading this inquiry.

29:14.071 --> 29:15.967
Yeah, well, we won't know for sure
it's them

29:15.968 --> 29:17.927
unless the ballistics
match the heroin hijack.

29:17.928 --> 29:20.488
Oh, yeah? Want to bet against it?

29:22.728 --> 29:24.727
What they get this time?

29:24.728 --> 29:27.488
Central Ballistic Lab's
five minutes down the road...

29:28.608 --> 29:31.728
...a cache of automatic rifles
en route to be destroyed.

29:35.808 --> 29:37.887
How many casualties?

29:37.888 --> 29:38.928
None.

29:41.101 --> 29:42.141
None?

29:56.848 --> 29:58.540
Look. I, erm...

30:01.581 --> 30:02.900
...I screwed up.

30:04.168 --> 30:05.800
I got it wrong and you were right

30:05.825 --> 30:07.127
- to react the way you did.
- Sam...

30:07.128 --> 30:08.238
...it's fine.

30:09.154 --> 30:10.274
Water under the bridge.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.480
I know, I just...

30:14.168 --> 30:16.340
...I wanted to say it, you know.

30:18.008 --> 30:19.328
Sorry.

30:25.215 --> 30:26.615
Anyway...

30:27.928 --> 30:29.407
...be nice to catch up.

30:29.408 --> 30:30.648
It's been too long.

30:31.808 --> 30:33.700
Yeah. Sure.

30:37.248 --> 30:39.008
Do you want to come up?

30:40.408 --> 30:43.780
I need to get everything together
for the gaffer and Kate first thing.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.008
I'll call you.

30:47.848 --> 30:50.100
By the hairs on your chinny-chin-chin.

31:51.488 --> 31:53.242
- John?
- Steph, Steph,

31:53.267 --> 31:54.752
it's me, love. I'm OK, I'm safe.

31:55.728 --> 31:58.167
I worry when I don't hear from you.

31:58.168 --> 31:59.767
I'm sorry I can't call more.

31:59.768 --> 32:02.260
John, there were coppers here
asking about you.

32:02.568 --> 32:04.007
I got their names.

32:04.008 --> 32:07.447
DI Kate Fleming and DS Steve Arnott.

32:07.448 --> 32:08.720
Arnott.

32:08.745 --> 32:11.007
I just said exactly what
you told me to say.

32:11.008 --> 32:13.488
No. I know you would.
Hey, you did the right thing.

32:16.088 --> 32:18.328
It's good to hear your voice.

32:20.201 --> 32:21.540
I love you.

32:22.548 --> 32:23.948
I miss you so much.

32:25.808 --> 32:27.527
Are the girls all right?

32:28.147 --> 32:29.787
They're sleeping.

32:31.020 --> 32:33.167
Can I listen?

32:33.574 --> 32:35.654
I'll put the phone next to Gemma.

32:58.768 --> 33:01.087
The chief constable has assured me

33:01.088 --> 33:03.727
that all necessary security was in place.

33:03.728 --> 33:06.407
This force is committed to bringing
these criminals...

33:06.408 --> 33:10.407
Sarge? I've located Corbett's
former covert-ops manager.

33:10.408 --> 33:12.207
Good work. Thanks, Tatleen.

33:12.620 --> 33:14.460
Ma'am, we've got the COM.

33:16.500 --> 33:19.127
Deputy Chief Constable Wise will
answer any further questions.

33:21.648 --> 33:26.207
I want to reiterate this force's
gratitude to the officers involved.

33:26.208 --> 33:28.087
- At this stage...
- Turn that bloody thing off!

33:28.088 --> 33:29.848
...to rule out links to previous...

33:39.888 --> 33:41.487
Cheers.

33:42.580 --> 33:44.527
- Inspector Cameron?
- Yeah.

33:44.528 --> 33:46.709
DS Arnott, AC-12.

33:47.300 --> 33:50.140
My DI and I need to speak to you
about Operation Pear Tree.

33:51.888 --> 33:53.687
Can we talk outside please, Ma'am?

33:53.688 --> 33:55.767
I don't have anything to say to AC-12.

33:56.220 --> 33:59.007
Inspector, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

33:59.380 --> 34:00.768
It's your choice, Ma'am.

34:18.808 --> 34:20.648
DI Kate Fleming.

34:22.007 --> 34:23.407
What do you want to know?

34:23.408 --> 34:26.047
You were John Corbett's
covert-ops manager.

34:26.620 --> 34:27.703
I was.

34:27.728 --> 34:29.428
Communications between
yourself and Corbett

34:29.429 --> 34:31.847
dried up about three months ago.
Why was that?

34:31.848 --> 34:33.687
John does things his own way.

34:33.688 --> 34:36.007
He wasn't too happy how
the operation was being led.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.246
What specifically was he unhappy about?

34:38.248 --> 34:40.847
Why you asking? It's all in the files.

34:41.260 --> 34:43.367
That's the point, Ma'am, it isn't.

34:44.020 --> 34:46.087
Maybe we shouldn't be having
this conversation.

34:46.088 --> 34:50.328
Inspector, this is a lawful inquiry,
it's your duty to cooperate.

34:57.376 --> 34:59.047
Why were you reassigned?

34:59.780 --> 35:02.867
Powell's version, I'd mismanaged John.

35:03.228 --> 35:05.247
Failed to keep him onside.

35:05.660 --> 35:08.168
This is your chance
to put the record straight.

35:12.528 --> 35:15.207
John thought Pear Tree was
showing signs of mission drift.

35:15.208 --> 35:17.447
- I agreed with him.
- Drifting how?

35:17.448 --> 35:21.905
Our brief was to identify high-level
links between organised crime

35:21.906 --> 35:23.567
and corrupt police officers.

35:23.568 --> 35:27.047
Instead, Powell was pushing us in
the direction of low-level targets.

35:27.048 --> 35:29.607
What was discussed in your last
communications with Corbett?

35:30.100 --> 35:32.847
John planned to climb up
through the ranks of the OCG.

35:32.848 --> 35:35.841
He's a bright bloke, a natural leader.

35:36.220 --> 35:38.087
He reckoned that was the only way
of making contact

35:38.088 --> 35:40.527
with the highest echelon
of corrupt officers.

35:40.528 --> 35:43.087
And then Powell vetoed the plan?

35:43.088 --> 35:45.527
That's when John threw his toys
and we lost contact.

35:45.528 --> 35:47.207
Right. So, was there ever any intel

35:47.208 --> 35:49.687
from Corbett on high-ranking,
corrupt officers?

35:49.688 --> 35:51.527
He believed he was on to the top man.

35:51.528 --> 35:52.767
Who?

35:53.260 --> 35:54.687
It was just a codename.

35:55.180 --> 35:57.928
Didn't even think it was real. H?

36:01.608 --> 36:03.220
Thanks, Inspector.

36:15.648 --> 36:17.460
Have you got a minute, John?

36:18.847 --> 36:20.247
Sure, yeah.

36:27.961 --> 36:30.441
All right? All right.

36:31.428 --> 36:34.548
You wanted attention, you've got it.

36:39.494 --> 36:40.940
He's here.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.853
_

36:52.580 --> 36:53.567
Who am I talking to?

36:53.568 --> 36:54.928
Just answer.

36:58.608 --> 37:01.007
We've seized automatic rifles
from the police.

37:01.008 --> 37:03.207
They've already been processed
through ballistics,

37:03.208 --> 37:05.527
so if they're used,
they'll just be traced straight back

37:05.528 --> 37:07.180
to the police lab, nowhere else.

37:14.454 --> 37:16.924
_

37:16.924 --> 37:18.583
_

37:18.608 --> 37:21.088
We're tooled up, ready for a raid.
I want to plan it.

37:27.079 --> 37:29.079
_

37:30.408 --> 37:32.127
It's the Eastfield Depot.

37:32.128 --> 37:35.087
It's where all the police forces in
the region store seized contraband,

37:35.088 --> 37:38.487
drugs, cash, jewels, precious
metals, but we don't just want

37:38.488 --> 37:40.847
to wait for the transport and
do it in dribs and drabs,

37:40.848 --> 37:44.207
we want to raid the place,
take all the best gear in one go.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.968
This could be bigger than
the Brink's-Mat.

37:52.768 --> 37:56.328
You know, but like you said,
maybe it's too hot to handle.

37:58.996 --> 38:00.996
_

38:04.488 --> 38:07.288
Guess he's going to have
a think about it.

39:05.128 --> 39:08.500
Take the cuffs. Take them!

39:10.980 --> 39:13.328
Open the door. Open the door.

39:14.954 --> 39:16.474
Get in.

39:18.380 --> 39:20.820
Put the cuffs on. Put the cuffs on!

39:23.260 --> 39:24.660
Tie them to that, go on.

39:35.608 --> 39:38.447
DS John Corbett. You tried
to make contact with the OCG.

39:38.448 --> 39:41.380
The boys ID'd you. They reckon
you're as straight as an arrow.

39:42.368 --> 39:45.167
- I am.
- Yeah, me, too. I'm doing me job.

39:45.168 --> 39:48.087
I'm investigating high-level
connections between organised crime

39:48.088 --> 39:49.407
and corrupt police officers.

39:49.408 --> 39:51.887
These stunts,
they've just been to get attention.

39:51.888 --> 39:54.085
And I've finally got access
to the top man.

39:54.086 --> 39:56.440
- H?
- I dunno yet.

39:56.465 --> 39:58.104
Contact's via a computer link.

39:58.105 --> 40:00.007
No voice, just text.

40:00.008 --> 40:01.687
But if I can get hold of that computer,

40:01.688 --> 40:03.167
we stand a chance of tracing him.

40:03.620 --> 40:05.127
Why are you telling me all this?

40:05.128 --> 40:08.167
I'm carrying all this on me own
here, mate. I need support.

40:08.168 --> 40:11.047
I get nothing off Powell. She's
so scared about what I'll find out.

40:11.048 --> 40:14.180
- She just wants me chasing small fry.
- Small fry like Malhotra?

40:14.181 --> 40:16.167
Keeping that to yourself
got three coppers killed!

40:16.168 --> 40:17.487
Look, if I'd given up Malhotra,

40:17.488 --> 40:20.087
the OCG would've known straight off
the bat they had a rat.

40:20.088 --> 40:23.159
- I'm after the big fish.
- Then come back in, work with us.

40:23.160 --> 40:25.167
Look, don't you get it?
That's what they want!

40:25.168 --> 40:27.527
If I come in, they'll charge me
or pension me off

40:27.528 --> 40:29.361
before I get a chance to crack the case.

40:29.386 --> 40:30.567
What they want? Who's they?

40:30.568 --> 40:33.207
The people who don't want the truth
coming out. They give you a job

40:33.208 --> 40:35.447
and then the first thing they do is
cut your balls off.

40:35.448 --> 40:37.327
You've got people killed.
Coppers among 'em.

40:37.328 --> 40:40.007
I've got to keep me cover! I'm
embedded with hardened criminals.

40:40.008 --> 40:42.607
How else do you expect me to
convince them I'm one of their own?

40:42.608 --> 40:44.607
You've crossed a line. You've gone rogue!

40:44.608 --> 40:46.687
Yeah, that's what they want you
to believe!

40:46.688 --> 40:48.207
They again! Who's they?!

40:48.208 --> 40:50.940
Powell! The chiefs! Your boss!

40:52.288 --> 40:53.807
Hastings?

40:53.808 --> 40:57.287
Open your eyes, mate.
Hastings shot dead one of the OCG.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.506
A dozen AFOs had weapons on him.

40:59.507 --> 41:00.765
You seriously telling me

41:00.766 --> 41:02.167
they couldn't have brought him
in for questioning?

41:02.168 --> 41:04.785
And Hastings, he doesn't get reprimanded.

41:04.786 --> 41:06.527
The chief gives him a pat on the back!

41:06.528 --> 41:08.967
What the hell's going on there?!

41:08.968 --> 41:12.469
Look, listen to me, mate,
I'm just trying to get to the truth.

41:12.470 --> 41:15.192
The top brass,
they don't want me to succeed.

41:15.193 --> 41:18.847
But there's a bent copper running
organised crime, I'm sure of it.

41:18.848 --> 41:21.300
Pull me in and he'll slip
through the net.

41:22.608 --> 41:25.687
Steve, if you're as straight as they
say you are, lad, you'll help me.

41:25.688 --> 41:27.007
Help you how?

41:27.008 --> 41:28.687
Investigate the intel I pass to you.

41:28.688 --> 41:30.807
You killed Maneet and three AFOs!

41:30.808 --> 41:32.720
Not me, mate. They got themselves killed.

41:32.745 --> 41:33.887
You could have stopped it!

41:33.888 --> 41:36.247
The AFOs in the last hijack,
they were all straight.

41:36.248 --> 41:39.247
Fellas like you and me,
just trying to get the job done.

41:39.248 --> 41:42.287
But the first lot, Cafferty's team,
they were all bent!

41:42.288 --> 41:44.660
We checked out Cafferty, she was clean!

41:50.528 --> 41:53.367
Everything I've said's the God's
honest truth, and I'll prove it.

41:53.368 --> 41:55.967
But that depends
if you've got the guts to listen.

41:56.340 --> 41:59.408
Or are you just another lapdog
for Hastings and the rest of them?

42:23.780 --> 42:26.288
Thanks for coming.
I was worried that you mightn't.

42:27.608 --> 42:29.658
Looking you in the eye, least I could do.

42:30.220 --> 42:33.247
Right, well, let's get a wee drink
here, settle the nerves, you know.

42:33.248 --> 42:37.847
Ted? Can we just... talk calmly,
like grown-ups?

42:37.848 --> 42:39.527
Yeah, yeah. Of course, of course.

42:39.528 --> 42:41.807
That's why we're here,
just to talk things through.

42:42.180 --> 42:43.967
I mean, that solicitor, you know,

42:43.968 --> 42:46.527
it's her fault, you know,
this thing got out of hand.

42:47.180 --> 42:49.648
Ted, it's no-one's fault but ours.

42:51.288 --> 42:52.888
Mine.

42:54.208 --> 42:56.847
Look, I never meant for this to happen.

42:56.848 --> 42:59.247
I just wanted us to have a better future.

42:59.248 --> 43:02.448
One bad decision, you know, one bad
investment, is that, you know...

43:03.648 --> 43:06.980
...is that any excuse to throw away
35 years of marriage?

43:07.608 --> 43:09.060
37.

43:09.408 --> 43:11.367
There you go.
Come on, let's grab a table.

43:11.368 --> 43:13.527
No, I'm not here to eat.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.681
I, um...

43:20.460 --> 43:22.727
...I'm here to ask you one more time
to sign the papers.

43:26.694 --> 43:28.174
We made vows.

43:31.301 --> 43:32.781
A man needs a wife.

43:38.608 --> 43:40.408
I've met someone else.

43:49.128 --> 43:52.567
Now, listen, love, things have
taken an unexpected turn, you know.

43:52.568 --> 43:55.007
An unexpected turn for the better.

43:55.008 --> 43:56.247
All the money that I invested,

43:56.248 --> 43:58.447
there's a good chance
that I can get some of that back.

43:58.448 --> 44:00.980
Not just some of it, but all of it.

44:01.968 --> 44:03.927
You want a better future, you have it.

44:04.660 --> 44:06.180
I found mine.

44:16.147 --> 44:17.627
Sign the papers, Ted.

45:18.768 --> 45:21.327
Boss? I've been thinking,

45:21.328 --> 45:24.167
maybe we should put surveillance
on Cafferty's place.

45:24.700 --> 45:26.007
Any particular reason?

45:26.008 --> 45:28.527
Well, the OCG will be worried
she can ID the female nominal.

45:28.528 --> 45:30.407
Maybe they'll try and finish the job.

45:30.408 --> 45:32.700
- OK, I'll think about it.
- Cheers.

45:47.020 --> 45:49.567
I need you to drop these
to Cafferty for me.

45:49.980 --> 45:51.841
She came through for us on the hijack.

45:51.842 --> 45:53.580
I want to keep her sweet.

45:54.208 --> 45:56.194
What about the copper on the door?

45:56.195 --> 45:58.608
He's all right, he's one of ours.

46:02.128 --> 46:03.928
Come on, lad, places to go.

46:05.768 --> 46:07.287
No, this...

46:08.688 --> 46:10.355
...this don't feel right.

46:10.356 --> 46:12.127
I know what you mean, mate.

46:12.128 --> 46:14.567
I trust Cafferty as far
as I could throw her,

46:14.568 --> 46:16.407
but this is to flush her out.

46:17.020 --> 46:20.780
If you smell a rat,
do anything necessary.

46:22.607 --> 46:24.127
Anything?

46:25.681 --> 46:27.201
Fill your boots.

46:28.608 --> 46:29.968
Hm!

47:11.008 --> 47:12.833
45-64, go.

47:12.834 --> 47:14.860
- 64, received.
- Go!

47:20.209 --> 47:22.294
- Armed police!
- Police! Don't resist!

47:22.319 --> 47:24.247
Turn around and face the wall!

47:24.248 --> 47:26.246
What you done? Have you grassed on us?!

47:26.271 --> 47:27.392
No!

47:28.208 --> 47:30.020
Move back! Back!

47:30.688 --> 47:32.927
- Face the wall!
- OK, clear!

47:32.928 --> 47:34.607
On your knees! Do not move!

47:34.608 --> 47:36.887
- Upstairs!
- On me! Armed police!

47:36.888 --> 47:38.447
Armed police!

47:38.448 --> 47:40.607
Do not move! Hands where I can see them!

47:40.608 --> 47:41.897
Armed police!

47:41.922 --> 47:43.609
Do not move! Hands where I can see them!

47:43.610 --> 47:45.847
I am a police officer, I am cooperating!

47:45.848 --> 47:47.180
Clear for entry.

47:47.928 --> 47:49.887
Cuff him, get him out of here.

47:50.420 --> 47:54.407
That man who was just in here,
I have never seen him before.

47:55.328 --> 47:56.848
Look around.

48:19.260 --> 48:20.839
Jane Cafferty, I'm arresting you

48:20.840 --> 48:22.885
on suspicion of misconduct in
a public office.

48:22.886 --> 48:25.100
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

48:25.101 --> 48:26.600
if you do not mention when questioned

48:26.601 --> 48:28.460
something you later rely on in court.

48:32.648 --> 48:35.759
- What the hell happened?
- Lee just said he had to go out.

48:35.760 --> 48:37.847
- Who with?!
- He didn't say.

48:38.247 --> 48:39.607
Where's John?!

48:40.568 --> 48:42.087
Your boy Lee, he best know the score!

48:42.088 --> 48:43.647
- He won't talk, John.
- He'd better not.

48:43.648 --> 48:46.167
So, how come the police knew
he was there in the first place?!

48:46.700 --> 48:49.007
Maybe they still
had their suspicions about Cafferty.

48:49.008 --> 48:50.967
They must have kept
surveillance on the house.

48:52.071 --> 48:53.037
Bollocks!

48:53.038 --> 48:54.287
No, we've got a rat.

48:54.288 --> 48:56.447
Get out there and find out who's grassed!

48:57.020 --> 48:59.167
- OK, John, yeah, sure.
- Come on, then, move!

48:59.168 --> 49:01.220
OK, mate, no worries, yeah?

49:02.368 --> 49:06.607
Hey! That's not a word we throw around.

49:06.608 --> 49:08.967
This unit used to be run by Tommy Hunter.

49:08.968 --> 49:10.687
Before your time.

49:10.688 --> 49:13.167
Tommy got immunity,
witness protection, the works.

49:13.854 --> 49:15.454
We still got to him.

49:16.234 --> 49:17.594
That's what happens to a rat.

49:39.820 --> 49:41.007
I'm alone.

49:41.580 --> 49:43.940
Don't worry, mate,
I know how to make sure of that.

49:44.460 --> 49:46.687
Did it all work out how I told you?

49:46.688 --> 49:49.007
Look, don't take the piss, mate,
it did, didn't it?!

49:49.008 --> 49:51.127
I'd never get an honest copper
killed, mate.

49:51.128 --> 49:52.447
The bent ones, they deserve it.

49:52.448 --> 49:54.739
They're vermin, the lot of them.
Right to the top.

49:54.740 --> 49:57.607
Maneet wasn't bent, she was trying
to do the right thing.

49:57.608 --> 50:00.741
I'm doing the right thing!
I'm doing more right than anyone!

50:00.742 --> 50:03.687
Look, if it wasn't for me,
they'd all go free, H included!

50:03.688 --> 50:06.607
Think, mate. Maneet didn't reach out
to you or anyone else.

50:06.608 --> 50:09.167
She never told you what
she was up to. And why was that?

50:09.168 --> 50:12.727
Because Hastings forced her out,
and you lot backed him!

50:12.900 --> 50:15.340
Look, she's dead just as much
because of you!

50:16.728 --> 50:18.287
Now, put it right, mate.

50:19.060 --> 50:21.087
Yeah? Do this for her.

50:21.460 --> 50:24.048
We'll go after the bent bastards,
whatever it takes.

50:25.248 --> 50:28.100
But once you're in,
there's no turning back.

50:30.321 --> 50:31.561
Are you in?

50:34.567 --> 50:36.127
All right.

51:00.408 --> 51:01.967
Wait there, please.

51:01.968 --> 51:03.700
Evening...

51:07.980 --> 51:11.007
I never would've guessed we'd get
so much out of watching Cafferty.

51:12.033 --> 51:13.035
Yeah.

51:13.528 --> 51:16.127
I've been developing a CHIS
who hears things about the OCG.

51:16.128 --> 51:18.247
I wasn't sure if it was going to
pan out or not.

51:18.620 --> 51:21.527
- Someone I should know about?
- No. Low level.

51:21.980 --> 51:24.007
Definitely not something
to bother a DI about.

51:24.008 --> 51:26.088
Hm. Just the way I like it.

51:33.888 --> 51:36.087
PS Cafferty, you remain under caution.

51:36.088 --> 51:39.887
For the DIR, I'm showing
the interview Image 19.

51:39.888 --> 51:41.400
At the time of your arrest,

51:41.425 --> 51:43.927
you were in the company
of the person shown in Image 19,

51:43.928 --> 51:45.607
identified as Lee Banks,

51:45.608 --> 51:47.807
a known criminal with
a history of violent offences

51:47.808 --> 51:51.207
and a longstanding association
with an organised crime group.

51:51.208 --> 51:52.768
How do you know Banks?

51:54.928 --> 51:57.527
I have never met Lee Banks before today.

51:57.528 --> 52:00.327
He gained entry to my home
by false pretences.

52:00.328 --> 52:04.964
Image 31 on screen shows
Item JD5 detected at your address.

52:04.965 --> 52:08.687
JD5 is an envelope containing £5,000
in £50 notes.

52:08.688 --> 52:11.560
How do you account for
JD5 being in your home?

52:12.224 --> 52:13.409
That was Banks again.

52:13.410 --> 52:15.700
He must have placed the item there
without my knowledge.

52:18.340 --> 52:21.141
In 2015, were you engaged in
an extramarital affair

52:21.142 --> 52:22.561
you were determined to keep secret?

52:22.562 --> 52:25.287
DS Arnott, this line of questioning
is irrelevant and oppressive.

52:25.288 --> 52:27.047
Were you contacted by a representative

52:27.048 --> 52:28.287
of an organised crime group

52:28.288 --> 52:30.407
in connection with
your extramarital affair?

52:30.408 --> 52:32.007
Jane, you don't have to say anything.

52:32.008 --> 52:35.260
Sergeant, assist with our inquiry
and it will be taken into account.

52:44.860 --> 52:46.460
They even had photos.

52:47.661 --> 52:49.221
Photos of you and your lover?

52:50.168 --> 52:52.848
CCTV from a pub car park.

52:55.448 --> 52:58.060
God knows how they got them.
They were going to show my husband.

52:59.020 --> 53:04.087
Everyone in my phone contacts,
the... parents at my kids' school.

53:04.820 --> 53:07.247
And to stop them
distributing the photos...?

53:07.940 --> 53:09.500
They wanted information...

53:10.608 --> 53:12.207
...on police operations.

53:12.208 --> 53:14.327
Little things at first and then...

53:14.860 --> 53:16.567
...it got bigger.

53:16.568 --> 53:19.567
Bigger as in the Transport
of Seized Goods ED-905?

53:20.220 --> 53:21.247
Yes.

53:22.020 --> 53:23.460
So, how did that work, then?

53:25.408 --> 53:28.167
They already knew about the shipment
from another source,

53:28.620 --> 53:32.367
a civilian administrator
who organised the transport.

53:32.368 --> 53:36.176
And then they put pressure on me
to rearrange the work schedules

53:36.177 --> 53:37.847
so that it would be my team responsible

53:37.848 --> 53:39.807
for escorting the transport lorry.

53:40.580 --> 53:43.687
Yeah, which got three innocent
members of your team killed.

53:43.688 --> 53:45.287
They weren't innocent.

53:45.288 --> 53:46.887
What, they were in on it, too?

53:47.460 --> 53:49.087
Kevin and Ray were on the take.

53:49.740 --> 53:52.887
Carl had a... taste for prostitutes.

53:53.700 --> 53:57.700
We thought we were just going to get
minor injuries. Tied up and...

53:58.928 --> 54:02.505
The OCG crossed us. They obviously
didn't trust us to keep quiet

54:02.506 --> 54:04.660
during the investigation
that was bound to follow.

54:06.460 --> 54:10.927
And the recent hijack, the firearms,
what can you tell us about that?

54:11.620 --> 54:15.927
While I was off sick,
I was still talking to other AFOs.

54:16.340 --> 54:20.020
Everyone was rattled after ED-905,
so there was a lot of talk.

54:21.288 --> 54:23.647
I found out about the transport

54:23.648 --> 54:26.527
and the OCG sent someone
masquerading as a nurse

54:26.528 --> 54:29.927
to blackmail me
into revealing the details.

54:29.928 --> 54:32.847
They didn't just have the affair
to threaten me with,

54:32.848 --> 54:35.540
they had the fact I'd been
complicit in the first hijack.

54:38.900 --> 54:40.647
Who did the blackmailing?

54:41.220 --> 54:43.968
A woman. 20s, mixed race.

54:47.528 --> 54:49.866
The person who first recruited you,

54:49.867 --> 54:52.727
the one who brought you into
this network of corrupt officers

54:52.728 --> 54:56.047
assisting organised crime, was it
this woman you've just described,

54:56.048 --> 54:57.527
or this man, Lee Banks?

54:57.780 --> 54:59.140
Neither.

55:03.754 --> 55:05.114
A police officer?

55:06.581 --> 55:07.940
I think so.

55:09.727 --> 55:11.327
Stay here.

55:12.208 --> 55:15.008
DI Fleming is temporarily
leaving the room.

55:59.744 --> 56:03.367
For the DIR, I am showing
PS Cafferty a series of images.

56:03.740 --> 56:05.248
KF1.

56:06.248 --> 56:07.768
KF2.

56:09.541 --> 56:10.861
KF3.

56:15.221 --> 56:17.301
KF5.

56:20.867 --> 56:22.147
KF6.

56:24.500 --> 56:27.649
KF1-KF6 are a series of images
of individuals

56:27.650 --> 56:31.647
known to be part of a clandestine
network of corrupt police officers.

56:31.648 --> 56:33.167
I'm doing so in the full knowledge

56:33.168 --> 56:35.727
that any photo ID would not be
evidential at this stage.

56:35.728 --> 56:38.220
- DS Arnott, agreed?
- Agreed, Ma'am.

56:39.580 --> 56:42.180
PS Cafferty, do you see the person
who recruited you?

56:43.305 --> 56:49.898
