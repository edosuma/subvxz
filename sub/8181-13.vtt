HEY, HONEY. LISTEN,

I CAN'T FIND THE SALSA.

00:37.119 --> 00:38.386
WHAT?!

00:38.453 --> 00:40.438
I BOUGHT SALSA YESTERDAY,
AND IT DISAPPEARED.

00:40.506 --> 00:41.606
IT'S GONE!

00:41.674 --> 00:44.409
OK, WELL, I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU

00:44.477 --> 00:46.995
DURING THIS VERY
DIFFICULT TIME.

00:47.146 --> 00:49.880
UH, BUT I JUST FOUND OUT THAT
I HAVE TO WORK LATE TONIGHT,

00:49.948 --> 00:52.817
SO I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PICK

00:52.884 --> 00:55.069
WELL, I-I CAN'T, EITHER!
I GOT A POKER GAME!

00:55.137 --> 00:58.439
CALM DOWN. I WILL CALL A
CAB FOR YOUR MOTHER. OK?

00:58.507 --> 01:00.825
<i>OK. THAT SOLVES
THE EASY PROBLEM.</i>

01:00.893 --> 01:02.293
ALL RIGHT. I GOTTA GO.

01:02.361 --> 01:04.029

OH, GREAT.
THOSE IDIOTS

01:08.334 --> 01:09.601
DIDN'T ORDER
ENOUGH SANDWICHES.

01:09.669 --> 01:12.771
OH. WELL, I CAN DOUBLE
YOUR SANDWICHES RIGHT NOW.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.175
GREAT IDEA.
YEAH?

01:17.242 --> 01:18.576
AND THEN I WILL PUT THEM
ON SMALLER PLATES.

01:18.644 --> 01:20.011
THAT MAKES EVERYTHING
LOOK BIGGER.

01:20.079 --> 01:23.381
I TRY THAT TRICK WITH MY
HUSBAND. DOESN'T WORK. OH, YEAH.

01:23.448 --> 01:25.217
OH... THANKS

01:25.284 --> 01:27.085

AROUND HERE,

01:27.153 --> 01:28.836
WHAT WITH TOM WEAVER
LEAVING.

01:28.904 --> 01:29.937
UH, SHERRY.
YES.

01:30.005 --> 01:32.156
I- I WAS WONDERING
IF, UH-

01:32.224 --> 01:33.792
AND YOU CAN TELL ME
IF THIS IS STUPID-

01:33.859 --> 01:35.993
<i>BUT DO YOU THINK THAT
I WOULD BE CONSIDERED</i>

01:36.061 --> 01:37.696
FOR MR. WEAVER'S
JOB?

01:37.763 --> 01:38.563
OH!

01:40.082 --> 01:40.899
EXCUSE ME.

01:40.967 --> 01:41.983
DUGAN GROUP.

01:42.051 --> 01:43.484
I FOUND
THE SALSA.

01:45.220 --> 01:46.387
AND I KNOW I SAID SOME THINGS

01:46.455 --> 01:47.989
MAYBE, IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT-

01:51.060 --> 01:52.760
SO, ANYWAY...
YOU WERE SAYING?

01:52.828 --> 01:54.912
I THINK YOU WOULD BE A
GREAT CANDIDATE FOR THE JOB.

01:54.980 --> 01:56.014
REALLY?

01:56.082 --> 01:56.748
OF COURSE, YOU'D
HAVE TO FAMILIARIZE

01:56.815 --> 01:58.300
YOURSELF
WITH TOM'S PROJECTS.

01:58.367 --> 01:59.500
YEAH. OF COURSE.
YEAH.

01:59.568 --> 02:02.036
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
THERE IS ONE THING

02:02.104 --> 02:04.905
THAT MIGHT WEIGH AGAINST YOU
WITH THE HIRING COMMITTEE.

02:04.973 --> 02:06.023
OH. WHAT?

02:06.091 --> 02:07.309
I DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

02:07.376 --> 02:09.144
OH, NO. NO.
TELL ME.

02:09.211 --> 02:12.880
WELL, THE THING IS, I KNOW HOW
BRIGHT AND TALENTED YOU ARE, BUT

02:12.948 --> 02:16.134
THE COMMITTEE, UH, MIGHT NOT
BE ABLE TO APPRECIATE THAT

02:16.202 --> 02:19.370
BECAUSE OF
THE WAY YOU... TALK.

02:19.438 --> 02:21.506
<i>WHAT? THE WAY I TAWK?</i>

02:21.574 --> 02:23.675
<i>WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THE WAY I TAWK?</i>

02:23.743 --> 02:25.443
CARRIE, THIS IS
A REAL ESTATE COMPANY,

02:25.511 --> 02:28.179
AND WHEN
I HEAR YOU SAY, UM,

02:28.247 --> 02:29.580
<i>"YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TAWKIN' ABOUT?"</i>

02:29.648 --> 02:32.534
<i>AND "HOW ABOUT
THIS FRIGGIN' WEATHUH?"</i>

02:32.601 --> 02:35.503
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'D BE
MORE AT HOME UNLOADING TRUCKS

02:35.570 --> 02:36.755
AT THE FISH MARKET.

02:36.822 --> 02:38.556
OK. I GET IT.
OR, YOU KNOW,

02:38.624 --> 02:39.724
MIXING CEMENT.

02:54.106 --> 02:56.007

I AM ALL IN.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.324
W- WHAT

03:12.391 --> 03:14.392
JUST IN CASE YOU TRY

03:17.213 --> 03:18.563
THANK GOD I GOT

03:38.717 --> 03:39.818
HEY, BABE.

03:39.885 --> 03:41.035
HI. YEAH,
THAT'S IT, SPENCE.

03:41.103 --> 03:42.837
PUT THE DRINK
NEXT TO THE COASTER.

03:45.157 --> 03:46.091
WHAT'S
THE MATTER?

03:46.158 --> 03:47.959
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
MY BOSS TOLD ME TODAY?

03:48.027 --> 03:51.046
<i>THAT I CAN'T GET A PROMOTION
BECAUSE OF THE WAY I TAWK.</i>

03:51.113 --> 03:53.614
<i>DO I TAWK
SO FRIGGIN' BAD?</i>

03:54.850 --> 03:55.883
DO I?

03:55.951 --> 03:57.569
NO, IT'S...

03:57.636 --> 03:59.987
IT'S LIKE MUSIC.
OH, SHUT UP.

04:03.492 --> 04:05.043
HONEY, I PUSHED
A BUTTON ON THE REMOTE,

04:05.111 --> 04:06.711
AND NOW
THE SCREEN IS BLUE.

04:06.778 --> 04:08.279
NO, SEE, YOU GOTTA
HIT "TV/VIDEO"

04:08.346 --> 04:10.381
AND MAKE SURE
IT'S ON CHANNEL 3.

04:10.448 --> 04:13.801
OH. AND DON'T MAKE ANY
PLANS FOR TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

04:13.869 --> 04:15.536
THEY'RE HAVIN'
A WINTER COAT SALE AT

04:15.604 --> 04:17.204
Big-and-Tall Shop.

04:19.858 --> 04:22.259
OK, FIRST OFF,
I HAVE A WINTER COAT.

04:22.328 --> 04:25.095
AND SECOND,
THEY KNOW I'M BIG.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.067
I ONLY COME UP
A FEW TIMES A YEAR.

04:29.135 --> 04:31.235
WE NEVER GET TO SPEND
ANY TIME TOGETHER.

04:31.303 --> 04:32.804
WHAT DO YOU CALL
THIS?

04:32.872 --> 04:33.954
SPENCE, IT'S TO YOU. UH...

04:34.022 --> 04:34.706
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:34.773 --> 04:36.257
I'M GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE BREAK.

04:36.325 --> 04:37.675
WAIT A SECOND.
YOU CAN'T.

04:37.743 --> 04:38.959
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A TOURNAMENT HERE.

04:39.027 --> 04:40.478
I CAN SIT IN
FOR HIM.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.747
WE PLAY HOLD 'EM ALL
THE TIME AT THE CONDO.

04:42.815 --> 04:43.748
THANK YOU,

04:43.816 --> 04:46.016
LET'S SEE WHAT
WE GOT HERE.

04:46.084 --> 04:47.485
WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?

04:50.038 --> 04:52.323
CARRIE, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA FIND THE ANSWER

04:52.391 --> 04:54.492
TO YOUR PROBLEMS
IN A BOTTLE OF PILLS.

04:54.560 --> 04:58.012
IT'S CHEWABLE VITAMIN C.
CAN I HELP YOU?

04:59.348 --> 05:01.166
NO, BUT...

05:01.233 --> 05:04.936
<i>I CAN HELP YOU
LOSE THAT ACCENT.</i>

05:05.004 --> 05:06.620
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

05:06.688 --> 05:08.205
WE MOVED HERE
WHEN I WAS 10.

05:08.273 --> 05:10.875
AND BEFORE THAT, I LIVED IN A
RURAL COUNTY IN WEST VIRGINIA,

05:10.943 --> 05:15.379
<i>AND BAACK THAN,
I TAWKED LIKE THE-IS.</i>

05:15.447 --> 05:16.831
REALLY?

05:16.898 --> 05:18.232
IT'S TRUE.
BUT I REALIZED

05:18.300 --> 05:19.633
IF I DIDN'T DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

05:19.701 --> 05:21.402
I WAS GONNA END UP
LIKE ALL MY FRIENDS-

05:21.470 --> 05:24.339
WORKING DOWN IN THE MINES,
NEVER SEEING THE LIGHT OF DAY.

05:24.406 --> 05:25.739
BUT DON'T YOU WORK
IN THE SUBWAY?

05:25.807 --> 05:26.657
WELL, YES-

05:26.725 --> 05:28.710
AND DON'T MINERS
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY?

05:28.777 --> 05:30.244
ROUGHLY DOUBLE
WHAT I MAKE,

05:30.312 --> 05:32.179
BUT THE POINT IS...

05:32.247 --> 05:35.383
I TAUGHT MYSELF TO SPEAK
BETTER, AND I CAN TEACH YOU, TOO.

05:35.450 --> 05:37.769
I
- I DON'T KNOW. THE INTERVIEW'S IN A WEEK.

05:37.836 --> 05:40.221
<i>I CAN'T LEARN A WHOLE
NEW WAY TO TAWK BY THEN.</i>

05:40.288 --> 05:44.525
<i>TAWK. OH, MY GOD.
I SOUND LIKE STALLONE.</i>

05:46.779 --> 05:49.380
CARRIE. YOU'RE SMART.
YOU'RE HARDWORKING.

05:49.448 --> 05:51.716
YOU CAN DO THIS.

05:51.784 --> 05:54.051
YOU REALLY THINK SO?
YES.

05:54.119 --> 05:55.886
BUT UNDERSTAND
ONE THING.

05:55.955 --> 05:58.522
YOU MUST SURRENDER
YOURSELF TO ME...

05:58.590 --> 05:59.991
TOTALLY.

06:12.671 --> 06:14.005
HI.
HEY.

06:14.072 --> 06:15.372
HERE'S THE MONEY
I OWE AUNT JANET.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.275
TELL HER CONGRATS.

06:17.342 --> 06:19.043
YEAH, LAST NIGHT
SHE WON BACK

06:19.111 --> 06:20.344
ALL THE MONEY
SHE EVER GAVE ME

06:20.412 --> 06:22.613
FOR BIRTHDAYS,
GRADUATION,

06:22.681 --> 06:25.016
AND BOTH
OF MY WEDDINGS.

06:25.083 --> 06:26.951
YEAH. SHE TOOK ME
FOR 35 BUCKS, TOO,

06:27.019 --> 06:29.687
BUT SHE SAID I COULD
PAY HER IN HUGS.

06:29.754 --> 06:31.122
<i>CAN I PAY HER
IN HUGS?</i>

06:31.190 --> 06:32.790
NO.

06:32.858 --> 06:34.626
THEN I GOTTA
GIVE HER A CHECK.

06:36.094 --> 06:37.028
PHWOOH.

06:37.095 --> 06:38.796
WHOA.
YEAH.

06:38.864 --> 06:39.798
COULD YOU ASK HER NOT TO
CASH IT FOR A FEW DAYS?

06:39.865 --> 06:42.133
I GOTTA MOVE
SOME STUFF AROUND.

06:42.201 --> 06:43.434
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:43.502 --> 06:45.286
YOU SHOULD GET HER
INTO THAT HIGH-STAKES GAME

06:45.353 --> 06:47.154
THEY HAVE IN THE BACK
ROOM OF O'DOOLEY'S.

06:47.222 --> 06:48.273
WHAT?

06:48.340 --> 06:49.424
YEAH. I MEAN,
THINK ABOUT IT.

06:49.491 --> 06:51.158
YOU-YOU BANKROLL HER.

06:51.227 --> 06:53.494
THEY'D NEVER SEE HER COMIN'.
YOU-YOU'D CLEAN UP.

06:53.562 --> 06:56.330
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:56.398 --> 06:58.166
YEAH, AND... IF
SHE WINS AT O'DOOLEY'S,

06:58.233 --> 06:59.733
THAT COULD JUST
BE THE START OF IT.

06:59.801 --> 07:02.353
YEAH! YOU COULD RIDE YOUR
MOM ALL THE WAY TO VEGAS!

07:02.421 --> 07:04.171
I WOULDN'T PUT IT
THAT WAY, BUT YEAH!

07:08.376 --> 07:10.511
LET'S WORK ON YOUR TROUBLE WORDS AGAIN.

07:12.180 --> 07:13.264
<i>TAWK.</i>

07:13.332 --> 07:14.249
I'M-I'M SORRY,
DID WE START

07:14.316 --> 07:16.251
SPELLING "TALK"
T- A-W-K

07:16.318 --> 07:17.685
AND NO ONE
TOLD ME?

07:17.753 --> 07:20.020
NO. TRY IT AGAIN.
OK.

07:20.088 --> 07:21.856
TALK?
DON'T-

07:21.924 --> 07:24.575
DON'T PRONOUNCE THE "L."
JUST SUGGEST IT.

07:24.643 --> 07:25.760
<i>TAK?</i>

07:27.429 --> 07:28.946
PLEASE TELL ME
THAT WAS A JOKE.

07:29.014 --> 07:31.315
NO! LOOK, I'M TRYING! I DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME!

07:31.383 --> 07:33.384
W- WHAT I WANT FROM YOU
IS TO TRY

07:33.452 --> 07:35.353
A LITTLE MUSCLE MEMORY.
OK? LET ME...

07:35.421 --> 07:39.524
LET ME ADJUST
YOUR PALATE...

07:39.591 --> 07:42.393
AND... TRY
THE SECOND WORD.

07:42.461 --> 07:43.394
<i>CAWFEE.</i>

07:43.462 --> 07:44.395
OK, HANG ON.

07:45.380 --> 07:48.366
AND... AGAIN.

07:48.434 --> 07:49.534
COFFEE.

07:49.601 --> 07:51.202
AND...

07:51.270 --> 07:52.870
ALL RIGHT.

07:52.938 --> 07:54.872
HERE WE GO.

07:54.940 --> 07:56.407
COFFEE.

07:56.475 --> 07:57.708
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:57.776 --> 07:59.243
GET YOUR STUBBY FINGERS
OFF-A ME. ALL RIGHT?

07:59.311 --> 08:01.996
<i>NO. STUBBY FINGERS
OFF OF ME.</i>

08:02.064 --> 08:03.815
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK,

08:03.882 --> 08:05.216
SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR POSTERS

08:05.283 --> 08:06.550
AND YOUR MODEL
OF THE HUMAN THROAT

08:06.618 --> 08:08.219
AND JUST GET THE HELL
OUTTA HERE, OK?

08:08.286 --> 08:11.723
FINE. BUT I SUGGEST YOU
START PRACTICING THIS PHRASE:

08:11.790 --> 08:14.458
<i>"I WILL BE GETTING
PEOPLE CAWFEE</i>

08:14.526 --> 08:16.227
FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE. "

08:21.633 --> 08:23.735
LET'S KEEP WORKING.

08:23.802 --> 08:26.070
GOOD. UH, I'LL GO
GET THE TONGUE CLAMP.

08:31.810 --> 08:34.912
SHOULD I GO OVER MY
BREATHING EXERCISES AGAIN?

08:34.980 --> 08:36.246
I DON'T KNOW.

08:36.313 --> 08:37.749
IF YOU WANT TO.

08:41.820 --> 08:44.421
LOOK... I'M SORRY
I BIT YOU.

08:48.761 --> 08:51.945
IT'S OK. MY... FINGERS
WERE IN THERE PRETTY DEEP.

08:54.516 --> 08:56.517
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU WERE
RIGHT. I CAN'T DO THIS.

08:56.585 --> 08:58.886
I'M-I'M GONNA LIVE
IN QUEENS FOREVER.

08:58.953 --> 09:00.154
I'M GONNA BE
A SECRETARY FOREVER.

09:00.222 --> 09:01.955
I'M GONNA BE MARRIED
TO DOUG FOREVER.

09:03.609 --> 09:05.959
OH, SHUT UP.
I'M TIRED.

09:08.030 --> 09:09.130
HELLO.

09:09.197 --> 09:11.765
NO, I'M SORRY.
I- I CAN'T TALK NOW.

09:11.833 --> 09:12.800
OK. BYE-BYE.

09:17.772 --> 09:19.090
WHAT?

09:19.158 --> 09:20.958
<i>YOU CAN'T WHAT NOW?</i>

09:21.026 --> 09:23.127
I CAN'T TALK NOW.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.761
<i>I CAN'T TALK NOW!</i>

09:24.829 --> 09:26.381
<i>NO, YOU CAN TALK NOW!
OH, MY GOD!</i>

09:26.448 --> 09:27.582
HERE, LET'S-LET'S TRY
OUR PRACTICE SENTENCE.

11:03.995 --> 11:05.262
DISHONEST? OH,
