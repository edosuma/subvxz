00:40.749 --> 00:42.791
(WHIRRING)

00:48.840 --> 00:54.178
Once upon a time,
in a kingdom far, far away,

00:54.345 --> 00:56.555
a baby girl was born.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.641
Her skin was pure as snow.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.269
Her hair was dark as night.

01:02.437 --> 01:06.398
- (BABY CRYING)
- They called her Snow White.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.942
Probably because that was
the most pretentious name

01:09.110 --> 01:11.236
they could come up with.

01:11.404 --> 01:16.033
As fate would have it,
Snow White's mother died in childbirth.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.659
Left on his own...

01:17.827 --> 01:20.120
- (GIRL GIGGLING)
- ...her father spoiled the young girl.

01:20.288 --> 01:23.123
He could afford to, of course.
He was the king.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.252
The king loved his daughter,

01:27.420 --> 01:29.713
- and all his subjects loved him.
- (CROWD CHEERING)

01:29.881 --> 01:31.381
The kingdom was a happy place,

01:31.549 --> 01:34.885
where people danced
and sang day and night.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.012
Apparently,
no one had a job back then.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.557
Just singing and dancing
all day and all night.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.601
But I digress.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.312
The king raised
the little girl by himself,

01:45.480 --> 01:48.190
grooming her to one day lead.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.319
But over time, he realized

01:52.487 --> 01:56.115
there were some things
he couldn't teach her.

01:56.282 --> 01:59.284
So he sought out a new queen.

02:01.871 --> 02:05.999
This queen was
the most beautiful woman in the world.

02:06.167 --> 02:09.127
She was intelligent and strong.

02:09.294 --> 02:13.507
And just to clarify, she was me.

02:13.675 --> 02:17.052
And this is my story. Not hers.

02:17.220 --> 02:21.515
Bewitched by my beauty,
the king begged me to marry him.

02:21.683 --> 02:26.520
I was everything to him:
the stars, the moon.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.690
But a dark magic invaded the land.

02:29.858 --> 02:33.235
The brave king bid farewell
to Snow White,

02:33.403 --> 02:37.197
leaving her his favorite dagger.

02:37.365 --> 02:39.908
An interesting gift,
but more on that later.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.077
(HOOFBEATS)

02:46.541 --> 02:48.834
He rode off into the dark woods

02:49.002 --> 02:53.005
and, sadly, was never seen again.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.257
(HORSE WHINNIES)

02:55.967 --> 02:59.219
Snow White searched and searched
for her father,

02:59.387 --> 03:02.389
and when she realized
he was truly gone,

03:02.557 --> 03:05.726
she was devastated.

03:05.894 --> 03:11.440
The girl was now left under the care
of the beautiful queen.

03:16.821 --> 03:21.783
Ten years passed,
and Snow White grew older and blossomed.

03:22.744 --> 03:26.496
But the kingdom fell into an icy despair
as the queen realized,

03:26.664 --> 03:31.835
if she wanted to remain
the most beautiful woman in all the land,

03:32.003 --> 03:36.840
well, Snow would have to do
what snow does best.

03:37.008 --> 03:41.428
Snow would have to fall.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.161
If someone would please
teach Lord Waverly

04:48.329 --> 04:51.415
his left from his right,
I would be so very grateful.

04:51.582 --> 04:52.833
Excuse me.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.503
B to J-12.

05:01.634 --> 05:06.638
My lady, I feel it is my duty
to tell you of the rumors

05:06.806 --> 05:08.515
- that I've been hearing.
- Rumors?

05:08.683 --> 05:11.727
Well, there have been rumblings

05:11.894 --> 05:14.730
that the kingdom
is close to destitute.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.482
If we were to join
our two houses in marriage...

05:17.650 --> 05:21.111
- (SCOFFS)
- ...I feel the gentry would be reassured

05:21.279 --> 05:23.905
that the kingdom
was stable once again.

05:24.073 --> 05:26.742
(LAUGHS)

05:26.909 --> 05:28.910
Brighton, a word, please.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.956
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Loose lips sink ships.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.042
Yes, indeed,
Your Majesty, exactly.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.210
Which ship would you like sunk?

05:37.378 --> 05:39.796
It's an expression, Brighton.
A royal decree. Take it down.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.841
- Ah, marvelous.
- Any busybodies...

05:44.135 --> 05:48.638
...caught rumoring,
gossiping, whispering,

05:48.806 --> 05:52.351
or even thinking
shall be put to death.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.313
- How does that sound?
- It's decisive.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.570
Snow White.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.073
Is there a fire?

06:07.075 --> 06:08.492
I'm sorry?

06:16.167 --> 06:18.627
Is your bedroom on fire?

06:19.587 --> 06:21.338
Because I'm searching
for an explanation

06:21.506 --> 06:24.049
as to why you would be out
of your bedroom and in here,

06:24.217 --> 06:27.302
and my first guess was fire.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.097
I thought maybe I could
come to the gala,

06:30.264 --> 06:32.724
you know, because today
is my 18th birthday.

06:32.892 --> 06:37.104
Is it, now? Oh, my, oh, my.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.606
E to F-3, please.

06:40.650 --> 06:45.862
Snow White, maybe it is
time I ease up on you. Hmm?

06:46.030 --> 06:49.574
After all, you've done nothing to me,
caused no problems.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.201
And yet...

06:52.537 --> 06:57.707
...there is something about you
that's just so incredibly...

06:58.918 --> 07:00.752
...irritating.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.671
I don't know what it is.

07:02.839 --> 07:07.759
The slumped shoulders.
The hair, that voice... Mm!

07:07.927 --> 07:09.636
I know what it is.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.513
- I think it is the hair.
- (GASPS)

07:11.681 --> 07:12.597
I hate your hair.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.853
I don't care if it's your 100th birthday.

07:18.020 --> 07:22.023
Don't ever sneak
into a party like this again.

07:26.362 --> 07:28.113

07:30.616 --> 07:34.870

five minutes and didn't even know it.

(APPLAUDING)

07:39.500 --> 07:41.460
Bravo, Your Majesty.

07:45.840 --> 07:51.178

when you've been beaten. Yes.

(GEESE HONKING)

08:05.234 --> 08:07.277
(BIRDS TWITTERING)

08:17.246 --> 08:20.040
MAN: I certainly don't like
the look of these woods, sire.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.334
If you don't mind me saying,
they seem very sinister.

08:22.502 --> 08:26.505
They're trees, Renbock.
Trees are just wood.

08:26.672 --> 08:27.756
It's not the trees
I'm afraid of, sire.

08:27.924 --> 08:33.720
There are stories of a man-eating beast
inhabiting these parts.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.222
It thrills my heart to no end

08:35.389 --> 08:38.350
thinking that my traveling companion
still believes in fairy tales.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.061
If you don't mind me asking, when does
Your Highness think we're going home?

08:41.229 --> 08:44.356
We've been on the road for months.
I just thought perhaps we could take a break.

08:44.524 --> 08:48.151
We didn't set out seeking a vacation.
We set out seeking an adventure.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.694
- Adventure, yes.
- And we're going to find one.

09:07.171 --> 09:10.006
I really don't think this is
a good idea, sire. We should ride on.

Not until we find out
what's in these woods.

that I will not fight a bunch of dwarfs!

- You're miniscule!

a lesson to these children!

You can't make a wish for me.

Do you know why I continue to work
for that wretched queen year after year?

12:42.303 --> 12:46.306
I do it because I know that one day
you are going to take back your kingdom,

12:46.474 --> 12:48.391
and I want to be here
when that happens.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.852
- It is not my kingdom.
- Oh, but it is.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.063
Your father meant
for you to inherit his crown.

12:55.107 --> 12:58.359
And that woman has
the entire kingdom convinced

12:58.527 --> 13:02.530
that you're a pathetic shut-in,
incapable of leaving the castle.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.241
And the worst is,
she has you thinking it.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.329
Your father's dagger.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.414
I had it cleaned up and polished.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.667
What would I do with this?

what goes on in your kingdom.

sing and dance anymore.

13:28.724 --> 13:32.227
And you need to believe.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.611
- I'm going out.
- Is she allowed to go out?

13:41.779 --> 13:44.489
I don't know. Is she?

13:46.408 --> 13:49.077
- OK...
- She's going out!

I would consider marrying him?

15:04.153 --> 15:05.778
A woman has standards, after all,

15:05.946 --> 15:09.032
and an exalted woman like myself
has very high standards.

- Interesting.
- What is?

15:11.619 --> 15:13.202
Your response to his proposal.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.997
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Consider the options.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.458
Well, this option
has a receding hairline,

15:18.626 --> 15:20.752
smells like rotten eggs,
and I wouldn't be caught dead with him.

You've spent so much supporting
your vanity, you can't afford to say no.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.759
Then why don't you snap your fingers
and make me a chest of gold, hm?

Everyone has magic within them,

15:29.887 --> 15:32.722
but very few discover it
and learn to spend it wisely.

Trust me. I am, after all,
merely a reflection of you.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.979
Well, not an exact reflection.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.118
What do you suggest I do?

15:54.286 --> 15:56.829
I suggest you marry someone rich. Quickly.

15:56.997 --> 16:00.750

RENBOCK: Hello?

16:12.012 --> 16:13.513
Is anybody out there?

16:13.681 --> 16:17.100
MAN: Shut up, Renbock.
Nobody can hear you in the woods.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.519
- RENBOCK: On the off chance...
- MAN: That there's somebody else

16:19.687 --> 16:22.230
- in these miserable woods?
- RENBOCK: Well, there could be.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.691
- Is that tone?
- RENBOCK: No, it's not tone.

16:24.858 --> 16:27.026
- I was repeating...
- MAN: You did it in a very smart way.

16:27.194 --> 16:31.322
I did not! I don't like being
this close to you. I've told you before.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.908
I was warned what I might find
in these woods, but...

16:34.076 --> 16:36.327
MAN: I picked the worst
traveling companion.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.622
...I never imagined this!

16:39.790 --> 16:42.000
- (LAUGHS)
- Who laughs at us?

16:42.167 --> 16:44.377
We are in dire need of your help, ma'am.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.755
- We were ambushed by seven dwarfs...
- Bloodthirsty giants.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.340
- Giants?
- We were outnumbered,

16:49.508 --> 16:51.551
we fought bravely, but they cheated.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.679
Young lady, if you would be so kind
as to help myself and the honorable Prince...

16:54.847 --> 16:57.974
- (GRUNTING, COUGHING)
- Prince of Embarrassment.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.893
Fool! I'm but a humble commoner.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.355
- Now, we order you to release us.
- Order me?

17:04.982 --> 17:07.358
If you refuse,
you shall suffer dire consequences.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.779
Only if you say please.

17:13.531 --> 17:16.992
Given the circumstances, sir,
I think a please is in order.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.121
You're right.
Where are my manners?

17:21.290 --> 17:23.540
- Please.
- That's all you had to say.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.127
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you so much!

17:27.296 --> 17:29.130
No, no, no! Wait! No!

17:29.298 --> 17:32.216
- (GRUNTING)
- Oh!

17:32.384 --> 17:36.679
- Are you all right? Can I help at all?
- (BOTH GRUNTING)

17:37.347 --> 17:40.058
- Oh, yes, please.
- Yes. That's it.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.268
- There you go.
- Oh, thank you.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.812
Oh, oh! Oh.

17:48.859 --> 17:52.862
Um... Do you want some help
with the rope?

17:53.030 --> 17:55.114
Yes. Thank you.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.494
I'm sorry you had to see us
in such a compromising position.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.039
We're going north.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.125

18:17.805 --> 18:19.430

18:20.891 --> 18:23.351
Then I guess we must bid you adieu.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.019
Hm.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.117
(SIGHS)

18:39.284 --> 18:41.744
She turned around. Did you see that?

18:41.912 --> 18:44.705
No. I don't think she's interested, sir.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.255
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

18:52.422 --> 18:54.590
- BRIGHTON: Your Highness?
- Yes.

18:56.885 --> 19:01.973
Pardon, Your Majesty, but...
you have a visitor.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.142
I'm not in the mood, Brighton.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.352
He's young, handsome...

19:08.397 --> 19:10.189
...and semi-nude.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.402
Your Highness,
may I present to you the esteemed

19:14.570 --> 19:18.156
Prince Alcott of Valencia.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.701
Your Majesty.
Please pardon our dress.

19:21.869 --> 19:25.246
I'm afraid my valet and I were robbed
by bandits as we entered your kingdom.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.665
Bandits? How awful.

19:27.833 --> 19:33.171
How absolutely terrifying
and smooth and hairy.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.757
- What?
- What?

19:36.925 --> 19:39.010
- What?
- Nothing.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.973
Could I trouble you for a covering?
Perhaps a shirt?

19:45.267 --> 19:46.726
If you must.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.729
Um...

19:50.564 --> 19:53.941
- Um...
- (WHISPERS) Brighton.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.068
- Brighton.
- Your Majesty.

19:56.236 --> 20:00.406
The prince is bashful
and requires, sadly, a covering.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.949
- BRIGHTON: Of course, milady.
- I'm not bashful.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.577
Sir, is there any particular style
of shirt you'd like?

20:04.745 --> 20:06.871
Brighton.
A simple covering.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.372
A simple covering it is.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.334
(QUEEN CHUCKLES)
Valencia, you say.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.628
I've never heard of it.
Is it a wee hamlet?

20:13.795 --> 20:16.172
No, quite the contrary.
It's a bountiful province.

20:16.340 --> 20:21.177
We have many natural resources.
Gold, silver, bustling silk trade.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.763
You don't say.

20:24.932 --> 20:28.226
Send out the invites.
Alert the caterer.

20:28.393 --> 20:32.563
I want you to organize a ball
like this kingdom has never seen before.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.274
We are gonna sweep this kid
right off his feet.

20:36.485 --> 20:41.322
Uh... Forgive me, Your Majesty,
but I don't understand.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.950
Brighton, the prince is rich.
He's built like an ox.

20:44.117 --> 20:48.162
I'm going to marry him, and then
my financial problems will be... solved.

20:49.164 --> 20:50.790
No, I understand that part.

20:50.958 --> 20:54.919
What I don't understand is
how you intend to pay for the party.

20:55.837 --> 20:59.632
It pains me to say this,
but you're broke, my Queen.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.968
Then go collect more taxes.

21:02.135 --> 21:03.552
(LAUGHS)

21:04.513 --> 21:07.139
Your Majesty, I don't know
the last time you were in the town,

21:07.307 --> 21:08.683
but the people are starving.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.434
Do you have no imagination?

21:10.602 --> 21:15.314
Go tell the villagers that bread is meat,
less is more, blah, blah, blah.

21:15.482 --> 21:18.609
Commoners love a good metaphor.
Just go sell it.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.361
"Bread is meat."

21:57.190 --> 21:58.691

21:58.859 --> 22:03.821
I visited once with my father.
It was a wonderful place.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.991
People always seemed
to be singing and dancing.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.827

- Good, you can read.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.854
Make sure they are collected
in a timely fashion.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.481
What's she doing with all our money?

22:38.648 --> 22:40.441
- Protecting you.
- From what?

22:40.609 --> 22:43.152
Must I remind you
of the brutal attacks we have suffered?

The only reason it hasn't gorged
itself on all of you...

22:57.125 --> 23:01.170
...is because your tax dollars
are hard at work.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.924
I'll be back tomorrow for the money.

a platoon of castle guards.

Just look how she's dressed me, sire.
Like a pink profiterole.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.774
That reminds me. We need clothes.
And gold. An army.

23:21.942 --> 23:25.111
Clothes? Why? Do you not like
the queen's taste in men's fashion?

23:25.278 --> 23:27.029
Have you been listening
to anything I've said?

23:27.197 --> 23:28.823
Yes. Soldiers, gold, clothes.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.282
- Yes.
- Yes.

23:30.450 --> 23:33.661
- Good.
- Only if you say please.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.541
Please, Renbock.

23:38.708 --> 23:43.379
Sire, I implore you to come back with me now.
This queen radiates crazy.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.881
You know these women always get crazy
when there's a prince around.

23:46.049 --> 23:48.509
No. There's
"I'm in the same room as a prince" crazy,

23:48.677 --> 23:52.763
and then there's just good old-fashioned,
plain, traditional psycho crazy.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.100
I fear she's the latter.

I pray you're wearing your pants.

for you, sire. I bid you adieu.

than you could ever imagine!

24:35.515 --> 24:37.808
- You saw the town?
- Yes. It's awful.

Oh... (WHISPERS) Go on.

She's taxing them more as we speak,
even though they have nothing.

24:46.151 --> 24:49.195
That's to pay for all her lavish parties.

For a prince.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.410

24:56.578 --> 24:59.079

he could help us take back the kingdom.

SNOW WHITE: Those men...

44:25.245 --> 44:28.247
They're the ones
that brought back the gold.

44:28.415 --> 44:32.210
The queen told you that they
were undesirables, but she lied.

44:32.378 --> 44:33.461
Huh?

44:33.629 --> 44:36.964
These brave men are the true heroes.

44:37.132 --> 44:39.884
They fearlessly raided
the queen's caravan and...

44:41.261 --> 44:42.720
...and retrieved your gold.

44:44.390 --> 44:47.684
They're the ones
that really deserve your thanks.

44:49.770 --> 44:52.689
- Yay!
- (APPLAUSE)

44:54.817 --> 44:56.025
Yay!

44:59.822 --> 45:02.448
- Yeah!
- (OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

45:13.377 --> 45:15.253
Are you enjoying the quail?

45:15.421 --> 45:17.755
Mm. It looks delicious,
Your Highness. Thank you.

45:34.523 --> 45:38.192
I could barely hear you
all the way down there. (CHUCKLES)

45:38.360 --> 45:41.863
You know, everyone has remarked
what a wonderful dancer you were last night.

45:42.030 --> 45:45.533
Thank you, Your Highness.
I do have one question about the evening.

45:45.701 --> 45:50.037
There was a girl there.
She had black hair and was very beautiful.

45:50.205 --> 45:51.956
Beautiful?

45:52.124 --> 45:55.126
Yes, I'd say she was
the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.

45:55.294 --> 45:57.253
Ever is a very long time.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.963
No, no, no, I know this in my heart.

45:59.131 --> 46:01.340
I think she's the most beautiful
woman in the whole world.

46:01.508 --> 46:03.426
Agree to disagree.
Let's leave it at that.

46:03.594 --> 46:06.637
But do you know her?
Ivory skin, black hair...

46:06.805 --> 46:09.599
Her hair is not black, it's raven,
and she's 18 years old,

46:09.767 --> 46:11.809
and her skin has never seen the sun,
so of course it's good.

46:14.813 --> 46:19.108
Meaning to say,
the girl you refer to is called Snow White.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.277
Snow White.

46:23.238 --> 46:25.615
I admit, she's very suited to the name.

46:26.784 --> 46:28.534
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)

46:28.702 --> 46:30.995
Most unfortunate case, really.

46:31.163 --> 46:32.371
The child...

46:32.539 --> 46:34.624
(WHISPERING) ...wasn't all there.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.959
I'm sorry, Highness,
you're speaking about her in past tense?

46:37.753 --> 46:38.920
Oh, I am.

46:39.797 --> 46:42.882
How indelicate of me. She's dead.

46:44.092 --> 46:45.676
- Dead?
- Mm.

46:46.762 --> 46:48.721
- How?
- Last night, in the woods.

46:48.889 --> 46:50.848
Oh. Treacherous place, the woods.

46:51.016 --> 46:52.934
- This is terrible.
- Do you need a second?

46:53.101 --> 46:54.685
Yes, thank you,
I just need to process.

46:57.189 --> 46:59.315
Prince Alcott,
I have a proposition for you.

46:59.483 --> 47:02.610
We're both single adults,
roughly the same age.

47:02.778 --> 47:04.695
- I don't think we're the same...
- I said roughly.

47:05.364 --> 47:07.448
The point is, the clock is
ticking for both of us.

47:07.616 --> 47:09.450
We are people of means.

47:09.618 --> 47:11.828
Would you do me the honor and be my...

47:11.995 --> 47:14.330
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- A moment, please!

47:14.498 --> 47:16.165
(DOOR OPENS)

47:17.709 --> 47:18.751
What?

47:23.340 --> 47:26.551
Pardon my appearance, Your Majesty,
but there's been a development.

47:26.718 --> 47:29.846
- The royal taxes have been stolen.
- Stolen? By whom?

47:30.013 --> 47:32.306
- Bandits.
- Bandits.

47:32.474 --> 47:34.517
Uh-huh, bandits.

47:36.270 --> 47:39.397
- Very intimidating.
- I'm sorry. I can't take this anymore.

47:40.065 --> 47:42.650
Enough of these cowardly muggers!

47:43.235 --> 47:45.152
Justice must prevail.

47:46.113 --> 47:47.530
Wait. Wait!

47:48.615 --> 47:51.701
Well, thank you, Brighton.
(WHISPERS) This close!

47:54.454 --> 47:57.957
- (WHISTLES) Huddle!
- The deal's off. She stole our money.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.960
(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

48:02.963 --> 48:04.255
ALL: You can stay.

48:06.717 --> 48:09.385
- (SIGHS)
- But we've got conditions.

48:09.553 --> 48:12.096
If you're going to live with us,
you have to be one of us.

48:12.264 --> 48:14.765
I have to be a dwarf?

48:14.933 --> 48:16.893
No. You have to be a thief.

48:17.060 --> 48:19.770
I feel I've been clear
about my thoughts on stealing.

48:19.938 --> 48:21.731
What if you were stealing
from the queen?

48:21.899 --> 48:23.274
You said yourself she's wicked.

48:23.442 --> 48:26.152
- Somebody has to stop her.
- Why not you?

48:26.320 --> 48:28.112
Why not us?

48:29.907 --> 48:31.365
I mean us.

48:31.533 --> 48:34.368
But this time I have conditions.

48:34.536 --> 48:38.205
Whatever we steal
goes back to the people.

48:40.167 --> 48:42.418
- Minus a small commission.
- Butcher!

48:42.586 --> 48:45.379
Fine. But she doesn't know
the first thing about thieving!

48:48.842 --> 48:50.009
Then we'll teach her.

48:51.470 --> 48:53.763
We'll teach her to believe.

48:55.390 --> 48:57.642
People think you can't be tall
if you're short.

48:59.603 --> 49:01.395
That you can't be strong
if you're not.

49:03.523 --> 49:06.025
A weakness is only a weakness
if you think of it that way.

49:06.193 --> 49:07.443
(GASPS)

49:11.949 --> 49:15.034
Never, under any circumstances,
give up the high ground.

49:15.202 --> 49:16.535
That one?

49:17.162 --> 49:18.871
(GRUNTING)

49:19.998 --> 49:21.248
(LAUGHS)

49:21.416 --> 49:24.669
Before you even draw your sword,
you must make an impression on your enemy.

49:24.836 --> 49:25.920
(SPITS)

49:26.088 --> 49:27.838
If he is deceived by the way you look,

49:28.006 --> 49:31.092
- the battle's half won.
- (GRUNTING)

49:32.511 --> 49:33.552
(CHUCKLES)

49:41.144 --> 49:44.730
People think of you as sweet.
They don't expect you to fight dirty.

49:44.898 --> 49:46.816
- Use that to your advantage.
- Whoo! Yes!

49:49.987 --> 49:51.487
Concentrate.

49:53.323 --> 49:56.033
- CRIMM: Your weapon isn't your only friend.
- Sorry.

49:56.201 --> 49:58.119
The environment can be an ally, too.

50:01.957 --> 50:05.251
Deception on the battlefield
isn't just an option.

50:05.419 --> 50:07.003
You're so cute when you're mad.

50:08.922 --> 50:13.634
Oftentimes it's the difference
between victory and defeat.

50:21.768 --> 50:23.352
(CHUCKLING)

50:25.731 --> 50:27.023
(GRUNTING)

- Oh!

50:37.242 --> 50:38.242
Ow!

- (YELLING)
- (GRUNTS)

50:50.714 --> 50:52.381
(LAUGHING)

50:52.549 --> 50:56.260
SNOW WHITE: I'm sorry.
But you deserved it.

51:17.282 --> 51:18.991
This is where
we were ambushed last time.

51:19.159 --> 51:20.618
Keep your eyes open.

51:23.163 --> 51:26.665
Oh! Oh, dear! (GASPING)

51:26.833 --> 51:29.543
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
I'll be out of your way in a moment.

51:31.046 --> 51:32.379
Oh, dear!

51:40.555 --> 51:43.099
Ma'am, may I offer you
any assistance?

51:43.266 --> 51:46.477
Oh, no! Sorry, sir!
Everything's all right. I'll just be...

51:52.400 --> 51:54.360
- It's you.
- It's you.

51:55.362 --> 51:57.321
- I thought you were dead.
- I almost was.

51:57.489 --> 51:59.782
(SHOUTING)

52:00.909 --> 52:03.369
- Give us your valuables!
- Stay behind me. You'll be safe.

52:04.371 --> 52:06.288
(GRUNTING)

52:07.999 --> 52:09.125
Here you go!

52:15.924 --> 52:18.551
- You're with the bandits?
- You're with the queen!

52:20.637 --> 52:21.846
(YELLING)

52:24.474 --> 52:26.851
- You're a traitor.
- And you're a jerk.

52:36.570 --> 52:38.362
All right, that's enough.
Stop this at once.

52:38.530 --> 52:40.197
- I can't fight you.
- Why not?

52:41.199 --> 52:43.075
Because you're a girl.
I don't fight girls.

52:44.244 --> 52:45.244
(GROWLING)

52:46.246 --> 52:47.663
Perhaps I should reconsider.

53:04.806 --> 53:05.931
(GRUNTING)

53:25.035 --> 53:27.745
The queen did say you were crazy.

53:27.913 --> 53:29.747
She also said I was dead!

53:30.957 --> 53:33.125
Watch out for that tree!

53:41.426 --> 53:44.345
The queen has you in her thrall.
Can't you see she's manipulating you?

53:44.512 --> 53:46.555
- That is absurd.
- (SHRIEKING)

53:46.723 --> 53:49.225
The queen would be just fine if you
and your friends stopped robbing her!

53:53.396 --> 53:55.105
Let's go for a ride!

54:00.070 --> 54:01.403
Ow!

54:04.991 --> 54:05.991
(GRUNTS)

54:07.911 --> 54:10.496
Hm. Yield.

54:11.039 --> 54:12.831
(HOWLING)

54:15.877 --> 54:18.671
- Should we help her?
- Glad you've come to your sen...

54:22.676 --> 54:25.552
Eh... She's doing pretty good on her own.

54:26.638 --> 54:27.805
Ow!

54:33.979 --> 54:37.398
If you weren't trying to stab me right now,
I might be tempted to kiss you.

54:38.900 --> 54:40.776
I guess I better keep trying, then.

54:45.240 --> 54:48.117
- Remember this?
- Yeah. Remember this?

54:48.702 --> 54:49.952
(YELLS)

54:51.162 --> 54:53.497
- Please forgive me.
- No. Forgive me.

55:04.759 --> 55:07.219
You've been bested, so yield.

55:11.391 --> 55:13.434
Put it down. We're done playing.

55:15.645 --> 55:18.063
Or did you not learn enough
from your spankings?

55:22.027 --> 55:23.319
- You even throw like a gir...
- (NEIGHS)

55:23.486 --> 55:25.612

(HOWLS)

55:29.743 --> 55:31.201
(GROANS)

55:31.369 --> 55:32.870
Why do you have to be so darn cute?

55:33.038 --> 55:34.455
What?

55:37.792 --> 55:42.421
Well, well, Prince Alcott.
We must stop meeting like this.

55:43.798 --> 55:47.801
We were ambushed.
Bandits caught us by surprise.

55:47.969 --> 55:50.137
You went to the woods
to find the bandits,

55:50.305 --> 55:52.264
and yet the bandits
caught you by surprise?

55:53.224 --> 55:54.808
I must admit, we were outskilled.

55:54.976 --> 55:57.311
Their leader was incredibly
ruthless and cunning. She was...

55:57.479 --> 56:00.230
She? The bandits' leader is a she?

56:00.398 --> 56:02.441
The bandits' leader is Snow White.

56:04.194 --> 56:06.904
(LAUGHS)

56:13.370 --> 56:16.538
Impossible, sir. Snow White is dead.

56:16.706 --> 56:19.208
Perhaps it was just someone
who looked like Snow White.

56:19.376 --> 56:22.586
- It was definitely Snow White.
- You were in the forest, it was dark.

56:22.754 --> 56:25.631
I think we should at least open
ourselves up to the possibility

56:25.799 --> 56:29.009
that it was just someone who looked
a lot like the late Snow White.

56:29.177 --> 56:32.638
- What a fun surprise.
- Agree to disagree.

56:32.806 --> 56:34.973
- You told me she was dead!
- He said she was dead.

56:35.141 --> 56:37.059
- I wish I was dead.
- You also told me she was mad.

56:37.227 --> 56:40.270
She is mad.
Not as mad as I am, however.

56:40.438 --> 56:41.897
So which is it, she's mad or she's dead?

56:42.065 --> 56:45.192
She seemed completely sound of mind
when she and her band of dwarfs...

56:45.360 --> 56:47.861
"Dwarfs"?
You said they were giants.

56:49.114 --> 56:52.699
They're giant... dwarfs.

56:52.867 --> 56:54.827
They're big, but sometimes small.

56:54.994 --> 56:56.912
I feel I have been deceived.

56:57.080 --> 56:59.623
- No, I am being deceived!
- Well, I feel...

56:59.791 --> 57:04.336
Oh, for the love of God, could someone please
get this man a shirt so I can concentrate!

57:05.046 --> 57:08.757
Not you, Brighton! Not you.

57:08.925 --> 57:11.260
All I know is I've been misled
either by you or by Snow,

57:11.428 --> 57:14.763
and I find this current line of events
to be completely confusing.

57:14.931 --> 57:20.102
"Confusing"? A fine word.
A grand word for this situation.

57:20.270 --> 57:23.772
In years to come, when people
look upon the word "confusing,"

57:23.940 --> 57:26.150
they will point to this very afternoon,

57:26.317 --> 57:29.278
when the world learned
that a dead girl was alive,

57:29.446 --> 57:32.448
leading around a band of giant dwarfs.

57:33.992 --> 57:36.285
And here I was having such a good day!

57:37.036 --> 57:38.203
(HEAVY EXHALE)

57:46.546 --> 57:48.589
Mirror, Mirror, on the wall.

57:55.763 --> 57:57.973
- Is she really alive?
- I was going to tell you,

57:58.141 --> 58:01.435
but I thought it would be more entertaining
to let you find out on your own.

58:03.104 --> 58:05.230
I don't understand!
Brighton said he fed her to the beast.

58:05.398 --> 58:08.692
Brighton fell victim to her beauty,
just like all the others.

58:08.860 --> 58:11.653
- I need your magic.
- MIRROR: There is a price to using magic.

58:11.821 --> 58:13.530
What is this "price"
you're always going on about?

58:13.698 --> 58:16.325
Do you have to be cryptic?
I just want her dead!

58:16.493 --> 58:18.076
So short-sighted.

58:18.244 --> 58:20.412
I need to do something
about this prince.

58:20.580 --> 58:23.832
Forget the prince.
Perhaps the baron is more your speed.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.751
No! I want to marry the prince!

58:25.919 --> 58:28.045
His heart yearns for Snow White.

58:28.213 --> 58:31.632
We'll use the love potion from before.
The one I served to her father!

58:31.799 --> 58:35.093
You used it up.
You've used up too much.

58:35.261 --> 58:38.305
- And I want Brighton dead, too.
- Don't overreact.

58:39.766 --> 58:42.726
Kill Brighton and you'll be
without your executive bootlicker.

58:42.894 --> 58:46.021
That's a very good point.
But he has to be punished for lying to me.

58:46.189 --> 58:48.106
Do something terrible to him.
Use your magic!

58:48.274 --> 58:51.944
- You'll pay the price...
- I know! I'll pay the price for using magic!

58:52.111 --> 58:53.654
I've got it! Now punish him!

58:53.821 --> 58:56.907

59:26.062 --> 59:27.896
You wish to see me, Your Highness?

59:28.064 --> 59:29.523
A peace offering.

59:29.691 --> 59:32.401
Thank you, Highness.
I don't feel like drinking.

59:34.654 --> 59:39.241
Because... you are a man in love.

59:41.411 --> 59:42.911
Is it that obvious?

59:59.887 --> 01:00:01.763
Unburden yourself.

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:06.310
I just... I don't understand,
Your Majesty. I don't.

01:00:06.477 --> 01:00:08.770
I met her in the forest,
and she seemed so kind.

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:12.524
And then at the dance,
she was lovely and charming and...

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.527
Perfection, really.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:18.238

01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:20.282
Her true colors were revealed?

Snow White...

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:29.541

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:33.503
Some would even call her
high maintenance.

- Must.

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:08.413
Oh, no. Gold is my lucky color.

01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:09.873
Of course.

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:44.150
we can still steal from them,
as long as they're not poor children.

thieving dwarves,

no other chance in life,

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:57.080
