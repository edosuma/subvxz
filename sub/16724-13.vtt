Hey, this stool is making
a new sound when I spin on it.

00:23.508 --> 00:25.910
It's somewhere right
between seal the animal

00:25.911 --> 00:27.745
and Seal the amazing singer.

00:27.746 --> 00:29.747
(squeaking, singing)

00:29.748 --> 00:31.749
I'd buy that stool's album.
Hey, hey.

00:31.750 --> 00:34.251
No having fun.
You kids are grounded.

00:34.286 --> 00:36.186
Here's something fun. I need
someone to run the old grease

00:36.187 --> 00:37.388
out to the Dumpster.

00:37.422 --> 00:39.056
Don't talk about Mom that way.

00:39.090 --> 00:40.190
Mom, are you still mad?

00:40.191 --> 00:41.592
You grounded us four hours ago.

00:41.593 --> 00:43.093
We've grown so much since then.

00:43.094 --> 00:44.695
Yes. I'm still mad.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.330
And I'm gonna be mad
about it forever.

00:46.364 --> 00:47.798
But it's the weekend.

00:47.799 --> 00:49.633
Everybody's supposed
to go to Bernie's!

00:49.634 --> 00:51.302
Come on, Lin.
I-I know you... No!

00:51.303 --> 00:54.872
Can I just... L-Lin.
Not talking about it. Ever.

00:54.906 --> 00:57.741
Oh. Here comes Aunt Gayle.
And I know this sounds crazy,

00:57.742 --> 00:59.410
but she looks like she's crying.

00:59.411 --> 01:01.579
Oh, God. She can't
just stop by, can she?

01:01.580 --> 01:03.113
Why don't we have a panic room?

01:03.148 --> 01:07.518
Well, my life
is ruined. (crying)

01:07.552 --> 01:09.220
Oh, God.
What's wrong?

01:09.221 --> 01:12.957
Oh, Linda, you remember
that guy I met on Cat Chat?

01:12.958 --> 01:15.593
Stacy?
Yeah...

01:15.594 --> 01:18.996
Wait, men can be named Stacy?
I love America!

01:18.997 --> 01:21.832
Well, we were supposed
to go see Yarnival...

01:21.833 --> 01:24.268
it's like Cirque du Soleil
but with cats...

01:24.269 --> 01:27.137
and then he canceled.
So I guess I'll take Bob.

01:27.172 --> 01:30.207
Oh. Uh, no. No, no, no.
No. J... No.

01:30.242 --> 01:32.643
I'll go with you, Aunt Gayle.
We've been meaning to hang out

01:32.644 --> 01:34.445
for ages but couldn't make
our calendars work, remember?

01:34.446 --> 01:36.614
No, take me!
I yearn for yarn.

01:36.615 --> 01:38.849
Please, Gayle!
I need to breathe outside air!

01:38.850 --> 01:40.784
I need to touch the wind!

01:40.785 --> 01:43.854
Wow, you guys really want
to hang out with me.

01:43.855 --> 01:46.357
Ah, they only want to go
'cause they're grounded.

01:46.358 --> 01:47.625
Why are they grounded? Well...

01:47.626 --> 01:49.460
No reason!
I just felt like it.

01:49.461 --> 01:51.862
They're not allowed to go.
Okay, fine.

01:51.863 --> 01:54.532
I'll go by myself.
That's okay.

01:54.533 --> 01:56.367
I can use the empty
seat next to me

01:56.368 --> 01:58.803
to slump into when I die alone!

01:58.804 --> 02:02.473
(crying) All right, fine.

02:02.474 --> 02:04.475
One of them can go.
I don't care which one.

02:04.476 --> 02:06.811
They're all equally
terrible. Eeny, meeny...

02:06.845 --> 02:08.445
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up there.

02:08.446 --> 02:10.447
You have to let us
compete for it.

02:10.448 --> 02:13.117
To the death.
No. No death, Louise.

02:13.118 --> 02:15.519
Or we could, I don't
know, maybe go by, uh,

02:15.520 --> 02:16.987
who has the biggest ding dong.

02:16.988 --> 02:18.522
Gene.
Mmm?

02:18.557 --> 02:20.057
No. I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

02:20.058 --> 02:21.692
You're gonna do
something you hate.

02:21.693 --> 02:23.694
Let me see.
What do you hate? Nachos?

02:23.695 --> 02:25.463
Homework. That's
what you're gonna do.

02:25.464 --> 02:26.664
You're gonna do math.

02:26.698 --> 02:28.132
Or we could write essays.
(gasps)

02:28.133 --> 02:30.201
(grunts) How dare you. Never!

02:30.235 --> 02:32.503
What a great idea,
Tina. I love it.

02:32.537 --> 02:33.971
Since I'm the one
with the tickets,

02:33.972 --> 02:35.973
I want the essays
to be about me!

02:35.974 --> 02:39.977
I want action, adventure,
love, drama.

02:39.978 --> 02:41.445
And Scott Bakula.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.314
Oh, God.
All right, you heard the lady.

02:43.315 --> 02:45.416
Your time starts... now!

02:47.219 --> 02:49.220
LINDA: And time. Pencils down.

02:49.221 --> 02:51.455
Okay, who's up?
Who's gonna read?

02:51.490 --> 02:53.724
I'll go first because I
have the biggest ding dong!

and Louisa, but they were</i>

08:42.105 --> 08:44.139
<i>less important and not
that much fun in general.</i>

08:44.174 --> 08:45.774
<i>Though Gayle was
extremely beautiful,</i>

08:45.775 --> 08:47.576
<i>she was also extremely shy.</i>

08:47.611 --> 08:49.278
Gayle, could you please pass me
the bread?

08:49.279 --> 08:51.614
(quietly):
Sorry. I can't. I'm too shy.

08:51.615 --> 08:54.416
<i>And the sisters were poor.
Very, very poor.</i>

08:54.417 --> 08:56.151
My petticoats are unspeakable!

08:56.186 --> 08:58.020
<i>The sisters got by
as seamstresses,</i>

08:58.021 --> 08:59.755
<i>sewing the butts back on
to soldiers' pants</i>

08:59.789 --> 09:02.491
<i>when they were shot off
in battle.</i> Mmm...

09:02.526 --> 09:05.427
<i>Tina longed
to marry Lord Jimmy Jr.,</i>

09:05.462 --> 09:07.530
<i>whose butt had been spared
in battle, but according</i>

09:07.531 --> 09:09.632
<i>to the law of the land,
she couldn't do so</i>

09:09.633 --> 09:11.634
<i>until her eldest sister Gayle
was married first.</i>

09:11.635 --> 09:13.602
So many fallen butts.

09:13.637 --> 09:16.272
Why for not can there be an end
to this war?

09:16.273 --> 09:18.841
At least we have the Rich Man's
Ball to look forward to.

09:18.842 --> 09:20.109
Pass.

09:20.110 --> 09:22.144
Oh, dear sister.
I cannot go to the ball.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.913
I'm far too shy.

09:23.947 --> 09:26.649
But, sister, until you marry,
none of us can marry, either.

09:26.683 --> 09:28.317
I want a wedding! But
instead of a wedding cake,

09:28.318 --> 09:30.186
I want to get a
bunch of cupcakes

09:30.187 --> 09:33.289
because it's a long time ago,
so that idea is still good!

09:33.290 --> 09:35.524
I am afraid I'm far too shy.

09:35.525 --> 09:37.793
We're all going to die alone
because of me.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.662
Don't be mad, though, 'kay?

09:39.696 --> 09:41.897
<i>That was the night that Tina
decided she had to find a match</i>

09:41.898 --> 09:44.333
<i>for Gayle. It was mere days
before the Rich Man's Ball,</i>

09:44.334 --> 09:47.369
<i>and so Tina had to find Gayle
a suitor and with haste.</i>

09:47.404 --> 09:50.639
<i>Tina tried every eligible
bachelor she could think of,</i>

09:50.674 --> 09:52.675
<i>but unfortunately
she could only think of one.</i>

09:52.676 --> 09:54.910
<i>Theodore the blacksmith.</i>
Thank you.

09:54.911 --> 09:57.213
Whoa, what do you call this thing?
It's a cup.

09:57.214 --> 09:59.215
Say it again.
It's amazing. A cup.

09:59.216 --> 10:01.017
You've never seen
a cup before? Nope.

10:01.051 --> 10:03.485
I drink by sticking
my head in the river. Oh.

10:03.486 --> 10:04.820
And what's this?
What's what?

10:04.821 --> 10:06.856
Uh, this thing all around us.

10:06.890 --> 10:08.457
A house?
How are you saying that?

10:08.492 --> 10:11.393
House? No, house. House.
How-use. How-use. How-use.

10:11.394 --> 10:14.163
House. House. House. Oh, God. How-use.
How-use. House. So quick. House.

10:14.164 --> 10:16.465
And what about... what about... what
about... what about... what about...

10:16.500 --> 10:18.968
<i>But alas,
Gayle's heart remained empty.</i>

10:19.002 --> 10:22.037
<i>Until he showed up.</i> My horse broke
down in front of your cottage.

10:22.072 --> 10:25.508
May I use your old-fashioned
ink pens and paper

10:25.509 --> 10:28.511
to alert my family and friends
to my delay?

10:28.512 --> 10:31.347
Then I will send the letters
with my servant,

10:31.348 --> 10:33.349
and my family will receive
the letters

10:33.350 --> 10:36.385
right before I get there.
It's a pretty good system.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.386
Of course, sir...

10:37.387 --> 10:38.888
Sir Bob. Belcher.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.257
Lord and heir
to the Belcher Burger fortune.

10:41.291 --> 10:43.859
Oh, my God, that's Bob.
(all whispering)

10:43.894 --> 10:45.294
Why, you're the lord throwing

10:45.295 --> 10:47.029
the Rich Man's Ball,
are you not?

10:47.030 --> 10:49.198
And who is this?
Ah!

10:49.199 --> 10:51.901
Your ankles are... great. Ah!

10:51.902 --> 10:53.602
Her name is Gayle,
and she's not married.

10:53.603 --> 10:55.304
And if you like her ankles,
you should see her shins.

10:55.305 --> 10:57.173
Her shins go on for inches.

10:57.207 --> 11:00.142
You better not be marrying my
Bob off to Gayle, little missy.

11:00.143 --> 11:02.211
Ugh, just let me finish, okay?

11:02.212 --> 11:05.281
Well, Gayle, I hope
I shall see you at mine ball.

11:05.315 --> 11:07.917
Oh! Ah! Ah.

11:07.918 --> 11:11.287
Should I, uh, pick her up?

11:11.321 --> 11:14.056
Nah, we usually just let her
sleep there when that happens.

11:14.057 --> 11:16.087
Oh. Wait. No, she's on fire.
Let's move her.

11:17.647 --> 11:19.448
(horse neighing)

11:19.483 --> 11:22.151
TINA: <i>The date of the ball
had arrived.</i>

11:22.185 --> 11:23.986
<i>Everyone from town was there.</i>

11:23.987 --> 11:25.688
Wow. Everyone from town is here.

11:25.689 --> 11:27.723
Even Lord Ken the albino! Ken!

11:27.724 --> 11:30.259
Oh, I can't wait to see Sir Bob!

11:30.260 --> 11:32.094
Yeah. Have fun with that.

11:32.095 --> 11:34.297
I'm gonna go put a bunch
of crumpets down my corset.

11:34.331 --> 11:36.432
Gonna leave this place
with a month's worth of food.

11:36.433 --> 11:37.867
Hello, Gayle.

11:37.901 --> 11:40.369
What is that lovely
sash about your waist?

11:40.370 --> 11:42.872
I call it a fanny pack.

11:42.873 --> 11:44.373
It's very fetching.
Oh!

11:44.374 --> 11:46.275
Hi, Lady Tina.
Hi.

11:46.276 --> 11:49.512
I hope you like the band
Boys Fore the Present Tyme.

11:49.513 --> 11:51.347
They are very
popular in the city.

11:51.348 --> 11:52.715
Come, let's dance.

11:52.716 --> 11:54.116
They're playing
the Heinie Liney.

11:54.117 --> 11:55.484
Oh!

11:55.519 --> 11:57.920
♪ ♪

12:18.275 --> 12:21.277
Tina, seriously?
Dad, please! I'm almost done.

12:21.278 --> 12:24.180
<i>Sir Bob and Gayle danced
together all evening.</i>

12:24.214 --> 12:26.649
<i>They couldn't take their eyes,
or butts, off of each other.</i>

12:26.650 --> 12:28.117
Where's my sexy fiancé?!
(guests gasping)

12:28.151 --> 12:29.619
Where is he?!

12:29.620 --> 12:31.087
Bob!

12:31.088 --> 12:33.589
Uh, here I am.
Uh, hi... honey.

12:33.590 --> 12:35.491
I can't believe
you'd have a ball without me,

12:35.492 --> 12:36.926
your loud, rude,
American wife-to-be

12:36.927 --> 12:38.294
that you're marrying for money!

12:38.295 --> 12:39.762
(gasps)

12:39.763 --> 12:41.297
Come here! Give me a kiss!

12:41.298 --> 12:42.932
(making silly noises)
Whoa. Uh-uh.

12:42.933 --> 12:45.401
(Linda makes silly noises,
Bob mutters) Aah.

12:45.402 --> 12:47.637
TINA: <i>Gayle was so heartbroken
over Sir Bob</i>

12:47.638 --> 12:49.805
<i>that she fell deathly ill
with pooping cough.</i>

12:49.806 --> 12:51.874
<i>Her sisters tried everything
to bring her back to health.</i>

12:51.909 --> 12:54.143
<i>Leeches.</i>
Yum!

12:54.177 --> 12:55.545
<i>Beaches.</i>

12:55.579 --> 12:58.147
<i>Screeches.</i>
Wake up! Stop being sick!

12:58.181 --> 13:00.750
<i>But nothing worked.
They called the vicar</i>

13:00.751 --> 13:02.451
<i>to come give her last rites.</i>

13:02.486 --> 13:04.153
I'm the vicar, Scott Bakula.

13:04.154 --> 13:06.455
Well, hello! I'm feeling
much better all of a sudden.

13:06.456 --> 13:09.625
Oh, good. Well, let me whisper
a prayer into your mouth.

13:09.626 --> 13:11.027
(gasps) Oh!

13:11.028 --> 13:12.461
(moaning)

13:12.462 --> 13:14.363
<i>Then they Quantum Leapt
into the future</i>

13:14.364 --> 13:15.631
<i>to the day
of their double wedding</i>

13:15.632 --> 13:17.500
<i>with Tina and Jimmy Jr.,</i>

13:17.501 --> 13:18.901
<i>and they all lived
happily ever after.</i> Mmm.

13:18.936 --> 13:20.670
And Sir Bob and Linda
were also married,

13:20.671 --> 13:22.371
and then they had a baby
with a tail

13:22.372 --> 13:23.806
because they were cousins.
The end.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.275
(gasps) That was so good!

13:26.276 --> 13:29.679
Oh, I could feel Scott Bakula's
kiss whispers in my mouth!

13:29.713 --> 13:31.681
Kisspers!
Ah, I've heard better.

13:31.682 --> 13:33.182
And your father and I
are not cousins.

13:33.183 --> 13:34.417
That we know of.

13:34.451 --> 13:35.852
You win, Tina.

13:35.853 --> 13:37.286
Oh! Or should Gene win?

13:37.287 --> 13:39.288
Oh, gosh, this is tough.

13:39.289 --> 13:41.824
(clears throat) I think
you're forgetting something.

13:41.825 --> 13:43.826
Oh, right.
Okay, go ahead.

13:43.827 --> 13:45.995
I call it "Gayle of Thrones."

13:45.996 --> 13:47.363
(all gasp)

13:47.364 --> 13:48.831
Pace yourselves, guys.

13:48.832 --> 13:51.300
You're gonna want
to save your gasps.

13:51.301 --> 13:55.037
<i>Behold the tale of Queen Gayle
of Catsteros.</i>

13:55.038 --> 13:57.373
<i>She was the most powerful woman</i>

13:57.374 --> 13:59.809
<i>in all
of the nine Cat-life kingdoms,</i>

13:59.810 --> 14:02.278
<i>and mistress of the world's
only cat dragons.</i>

14:02.312 --> 14:07.717
People of Catsteros, please eat,
drink and be meowy!

14:07.751 --> 14:10.153
Your Royal Highness... meow...

14:10.154 --> 14:13.523
visitors from the kingdom
of Litter Boxia!

14:13.524 --> 14:16.025
Lady Gayle, we come
on behalf of your sister,

14:16.026 --> 14:17.894
Lindaryen of Litter Boxia,

14:17.895 --> 14:19.862
to present you with a gift
in her absence.

14:19.897 --> 14:21.998
A gift?
I'm surprised.

14:21.999 --> 14:24.500
She's always been jealous of me
because I have cat dragons,

14:24.501 --> 14:26.335
and I'm not a cranky old hag.

14:26.336 --> 14:28.237
Oh, well,
she didn't mention that.

14:28.238 --> 14:30.506
And now, may I present,
this guy!

14:30.507 --> 14:31.908
I'm Gene

14:31.909 --> 14:33.543
from the House of the Unfarting.

14:33.544 --> 14:35.344
My Queen, I am a warlock.

14:35.345 --> 14:37.547
If I disappear,
just check your rear. Blee.

14:37.548 --> 14:38.915
<i>But don't worry.</i>

14:38.949 --> 14:40.349
<i>I always turn up. Blee.</i>

14:40.350 --> 14:42.218
Just never where you left me!

14:42.219 --> 14:43.619
Oh, impressive.

14:43.620 --> 14:45.721
He was over there... meow...

14:45.722 --> 14:47.890
and now he's over here. Meow.

14:47.891 --> 14:49.258
I'm befuddled.

14:49.293 --> 14:50.860
I love your cat dragons!

14:50.861 --> 14:53.196
I'll take them
in my wagon. Blee.

14:53.197 --> 14:54.864
(gasps)
Wha? I'm checking my rear!

14:54.865 --> 14:57.733
He's not there!
And he took my cat dragons!

14:57.734 --> 14:59.135
Blee. Here I am.

14:59.136 --> 15:00.570
Oh, phew.
Blee.

15:00.571 --> 15:03.406
- Just kidding.
- No!

15:05.548 --> 15:08.249
My cat dragons are gone.
I must go get them.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.651
They are my children.

15:09.652 --> 15:11.152
They've suckled at my teats!

15:11.153 --> 15:12.887
Ew.
(crowd murmuring)

15:12.922 --> 15:14.656
At least let our bravest
knight go with you

15:14.657 --> 15:16.424
to assist Your Grace. Meow.

15:16.425 --> 15:18.293
My Lady Gayle.

15:18.327 --> 15:20.662
Knight Louise, this is my fight.

15:20.663 --> 15:22.564
I cannot risk your life.

15:22.598 --> 15:25.733
But I can. Plus,
I <i> really</i> dislike Lindaryen.

15:25.734 --> 15:28.169
She's a tyrant who punishes
children unjustly

15:28.170 --> 15:30.071
for doing hilarious pranks.

15:30.072 --> 15:33.508
I swear my service
and my steel to you.

15:33.509 --> 15:36.411
(gasps) The Burgarean Slapper!

15:36.445 --> 15:37.946
Let us be off.

15:37.947 --> 15:40.515
My cat dragons are
probably very confused

15:40.516 --> 15:43.084
without me and my breast milk.

15:43.085 --> 15:44.819
People of Catsteros,

15:44.820 --> 15:46.921
remain here, remain strong.

15:46.922 --> 15:50.024
I will return with our dragons!

15:50.025 --> 15:51.659
(applause and cheering)

15:51.694 --> 15:57.132
And then I shall
breast-feed all of you! Oh.

15:57.166 --> 16:00.001
LOUISE: <i>And so they set off
for Litter Boxia,</i>

16:00.035 --> 16:02.470
<i>fighting their many enemies
along the way.</i>

16:02.505 --> 16:05.140
<i>They were held prisoner
by Theus of Grimward,</i>

16:05.174 --> 16:08.076
<i>Thannis of Grinjammed,
and Thambis of Gramjimnt.</i>

16:08.110 --> 16:10.278
<i>But each time, they escaped.</i>

16:10.312 --> 16:13.181
There are the gates of
Litter Boxia, My Queen.

16:13.215 --> 16:15.350
Wow, it really stinks here.

16:15.384 --> 16:18.386
Yes, Litter Boxia has not
been cleaned in many moons.

16:18.387 --> 16:20.321
<i>And outside of Litter Boxia,</i>

16:20.322 --> 16:21.823
<i>the most dreaded monsters</i>

16:21.824 --> 16:23.825
<i>in all of the Nine
Cat-Life Kingdoms.</i>

16:23.826 --> 16:25.460
(man speaking) Hark, my lady.
A sound ahead.

16:25.494 --> 16:28.196
What is it?
It sounds really boring.

16:28.230 --> 16:29.998
It's a White Talker!

16:29.999 --> 16:31.633
Cover your ears, or they will

16:31.634 --> 16:34.002
literally bore you into
a deathlike slumber. (gasps)

16:34.003 --> 16:35.570
I tried everything

16:35.571 --> 16:37.071
to get that barbecue stain
out of my underpants.

16:37.072 --> 16:38.807
The best place to park
at the hardware store

16:38.808 --> 16:40.175
is probably the parking lot.

16:40.176 --> 16:42.977
Oh. Oh, I have an itch.
Oh. Oh, God. Oh, it...

16:42.978 --> 16:45.914
Oh, it's so itchy.
Oh, I got to itch it. Don't itch it!

16:45.915 --> 16:48.049
Oh, I can't wait any longer!

16:48.083 --> 16:49.584
Do not take your hands
off your ears!

16:49.585 --> 16:51.152
My lady, no!
Oh, I got to itch it.

16:51.153 --> 16:54.255
Oh, God! Oh, oh! Ugh.

16:54.256 --> 16:57.258
(yells) Oh, no.
He got me.

16:57.259 --> 16:58.726
So boring.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.429
I'm... so bored.

17:01.430 --> 17:04.733
Louise...!

17:04.733 --> 17:07.469
Who goes there?
It is I,

17:07.502 --> 17:09.436
Gayle, Queen of Catsteros.

17:09.438 --> 17:11.039
I seek my sister Lindaryen.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.540
She has stolen my dragons.

17:13.576 --> 17:15.109
Oh. Okay.

17:15.111 --> 17:16.578
So you're Gayle. Okay.

17:16.579 --> 17:19.012
Just go in or whatever. Hi.

17:20.950 --> 17:22.751
Everyone, listen to me sing!

17:22.785 --> 17:24.953
♪ La, la, la, la-la-la-la-la. ♪

17:24.954 --> 17:27.521
Bobdor.
Gayle!

17:27.556 --> 17:30.024
Sister. Surprised to see me?

17:30.059 --> 17:32.127
Not at all!
I knew you'd come,

17:32.128 --> 17:35.830
and I knew when you did I'd get
rid of you once and for all!

17:35.865 --> 17:38.333
I challenge you... to a duel.

17:38.367 --> 17:40.034
(gasps) To the death?

17:40.035 --> 17:41.302
Yes! But let's do that thing

17:41.303 --> 17:42.904
where we pick someone
to represent us

17:42.905 --> 17:45.106
and fight in our honor, and then
die in our place, right?

17:45.107 --> 17:46.040
Oh, good idea.

17:46.041 --> 17:48.109
I choose The Mort-tain!

17:48.110 --> 17:50.812
Mm, uh. Huh?
Oh, okay.

17:50.813 --> 17:52.313
Um, hang on.

17:52.314 --> 17:54.916
Sorry to do this,
Louise, but I need you.

17:54.950 --> 17:57.285
Aah. What-What's going on?

17:57.319 --> 17:59.421
I need you to fight for me
in a duel to the death.

17:59.422 --> 18:01.423
Oh! Good. LINDA: Enough talk!

18:01.457 --> 18:03.091
Let the duel commence!

18:03.125 --> 18:06.428
But let's make this fight
a little more interesting.

18:06.462 --> 18:08.196
Be careful not to fall

18:08.230 --> 18:11.433
into my pit of ravenous
porcelain babies.

18:11.434 --> 18:14.803
(babies crying)
They haven't been fed in days.

18:14.837 --> 18:17.005
(maniacal chuckle) So hungry.

18:17.006 --> 18:18.506
(grunts) (yells)

18:18.507 --> 18:19.941
Thanks for playing, big guy.

18:19.942 --> 18:21.443
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
(babies whining)

18:21.477 --> 18:23.611
Oh, crap.
Shouldn't have done that.

18:23.646 --> 18:26.114
Well, you beat me
fair and square,

18:26.115 --> 18:27.749
but I'm gonna kill you anyway.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.284
Bobdor, throw 'em into the pit.

18:29.285 --> 18:30.685
Bobdor.

18:30.686 --> 18:32.487
Does that mean yes or no?

18:32.488 --> 18:34.222
'Cause it's the only thing
you ever say. Bobdor.

18:34.256 --> 18:35.657
Yeah, that doesn't help.

18:35.658 --> 18:37.959
I got to get a new fool.
Maybe somebody thinner.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.729
I want somebody hot.

18:40.763 --> 18:42.197
What-what are you doing?

18:42.198 --> 18:44.766
Aah! Ow! Oh!
My babies are eating me!

18:44.767 --> 18:46.134
Oh, bad babies! Down!

18:46.168 --> 18:48.370
Thank you, Bobdor.

18:48.371 --> 18:51.940
I'll breast-feed you first
when we get back to Catsteros.

18:51.941 --> 18:55.377
All right, everybody,
let's go home.

18:55.378 --> 18:58.313
(gasps) Scott Bakula?!
Where did you come from?

18:58.314 --> 19:00.048
Does it really matter?

19:00.049 --> 19:02.150
Bobdor third wheel.
Bye-bye.

19:02.151 --> 19:04.786
Bobdor!

19:04.820 --> 19:06.521
The end.

19:06.522 --> 19:09.024
Louise, you haven't watched
<i>Game of Thrones,</i> right?

19:09.058 --> 19:10.659
No. Game of what?

19:10.660 --> 19:12.260
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:12.294 --> 19:15.130
Oh, Louise,
that was so good. Yup.

19:15.131 --> 19:18.700
You're just all such
wonderful nieces and nephews.

19:18.701 --> 19:21.169
I don't need Stacy.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.471
You've shown me
that I'm talented

19:23.472 --> 19:25.674
and lovable and strong...

19:25.675 --> 19:27.075
(door opens, bells tinkle)
Hey, Gayle.

19:27.076 --> 19:29.511
Still up for that date?
My emergency canceled.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.813
Stacy! How'd you find me?

19:31.847 --> 19:34.316
All those messages you left me
at work and at home

19:34.317 --> 19:36.518
and at my mother's
telling me where you were going.

19:36.552 --> 19:37.686
Oh. Oh, yeah.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.254
Okay, let's get out of here!

19:39.255 --> 19:40.288
Bye, kids.

19:40.323 --> 19:41.723
No!
No!

19:41.724 --> 19:43.158
Son of a bitch!

19:43.159 --> 19:44.726
Mom, come on. Are we really
still grounded?

19:44.760 --> 19:46.394
We were just trying to be funny.

19:46.395 --> 19:47.929
Yeah. We tried
to make you laugh,

19:47.930 --> 19:49.230
but instead, you
made the world laugh.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.566
Uh-huh.
It did sound kind of funny.

19:53.002 --> 19:55.337
Hey, uh, Mom, uh,
can we get some ice cream?

19:55.338 --> 19:57.505
Yeah. From that case
right there. Yeah!

19:57.506 --> 19:59.007
Ice cream. Yummy.
Good idea, girls.

19:59.008 --> 20:01.176
Freezer Frankenstein!

20:01.210 --> 20:03.912
(yelling)
Oh. Uh. Whoo. Oh. Whoa.

20:03.946 --> 20:05.613
(passing wind, laughter)

20:07.850 --> 20:10.585
Lin, you fell into a pile
of maxi pads, and you farted.

20:10.586 --> 20:12.087
It's pretty funny.

20:12.088 --> 20:13.722
It wasn't funny!
Everyone laughed at me.

20:13.723 --> 20:15.223
Yeah. Yup. Yup.

20:15.224 --> 20:17.092
And then I had to buy
all those maxi pads.

20:17.093 --> 20:19.594
Oh, it's gonna take me
weeks to get through those!

20:19.595 --> 20:22.263
And then I farted again when
they handed me my bags.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.698
Mom, it was perfect.
Don't you see?

20:23.699 --> 20:25.267
I'm proud of you!

20:25.268 --> 20:27.235
You farted your way
into our hearts, Mom.

20:27.236 --> 20:28.603
Okay. It was...
it was funny.

20:28.604 --> 20:30.839
It was funny. (laughs)

20:30.873 --> 20:32.374
So, we aren't grounded anymore?

20:32.408 --> 20:33.808
Tell you what. You're
grounded for tonight,

20:33.809 --> 20:35.744
and you all have
to watch TV with me.

20:35.745 --> 20:37.112
All right, it's something.

20:37.113 --> 20:38.647
And we're gonna watch
whatever I want,

20:38.648 --> 20:40.515
and we're gonna be
a big snuggle sandwich.

20:40.549 --> 20:43.418
I'm the cheese, right in the
middle, and everyone likes me!

20:43.419 --> 20:44.986
Wait, where are you going?
We're not closed.

20:44.987 --> 20:46.554
We-we don't close for hours.
Bye, Dad!

20:46.555 --> 20:48.323
Wai-wai-wai-wait.
Don't close the d...

20:48.324 --> 20:50.898
They closed the door.
I should have gone with Gayle.
