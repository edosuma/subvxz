WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.033
(Chloe) Ding dong!

00:09.100 --> 00:10.833
We... are... back!

00:10.900 --> 00:12.167
(cheering)

00:12.233 --> 00:14.800
Ready to paint the Toon
black and white!

00:14.867 --> 00:16.267
(cheering)

00:18.067 --> 00:19.900
Last time was pure fucking mad!

00:19.967 --> 00:21.033
(cheering)

00:24.133 --> 00:28.100
Anna sent in a load of radgies
to compete to join the family.

00:28.167 --> 00:31.300
Fucking come on!
(screaming, thudding)

00:32.033 --> 00:34.467
But only one lucky newbie
got picked.

00:34.533 --> 00:36.500
(yells) Hello!

00:36.567 --> 00:37.967
Me!
Abbie!

00:38.033 --> 00:41.100
Abbie, welcome to the family.
(all) Abbie!

00:41.167 --> 00:43.200
I cannot wait to get stuck in.

00:43.267 --> 00:45.133
Fuck off, Scott. Arsehole.

00:46.067 --> 00:50.000
This time things are gonna
be....
pure crazy!

00:53.667 --> 00:55.433
Let's get fucking mortal.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.867
(cheering)

00:58.933 --> 01:00.633
Yay!

01:00.700 --> 01:02.100
Fuck off.
Fucking divvy.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.367
We are going to Rome!
Come on!

01:06.367 --> 01:07.800
Yes!

01:12.467 --> 01:15.267
We're gonna be the radgiest
we have ever been.

01:17.733 --> 01:19.267
What the hell?!

01:21.933 --> 01:23.333
Oi, oi!

01:24.167 --> 01:25.733
Oh, fucking yes, ah!

01:27.233 --> 01:29.833
(Chloe) Aaron!
Fucking mug!

01:29.900 --> 01:32.467
It's gonna be the maddest
of mad tings!

01:32.533 --> 01:33.700
(glass shattering)

01:36.300 --> 01:37.533
Oh, my God!

01:39.300 --> 01:41.100
This is amazing!

01:41.167 --> 01:45.300
(cheering)
One big fucked-up family.

01:45.367 --> 01:48.600
Cheers!
(laughter)

01:50.000 --> 01:52.333
'I should have a degree
in pulling women.'

01:52.400 --> 01:54.967
'I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.'

01:55.033 --> 01:57.400
'I'm gonna tear the place up.'

01:57.467 --> 02:00.667
'I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.'

02:00.733 --> 02:02.500
'I'm preened to perfection.'

02:02.567 --> 02:04.900
'I'm totally crackers me, like.'

02:04.967 --> 02:07.733
'I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.'

02:07.800 --> 02:10.699
'I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.'

02:10.767 --> 02:14.300
'My quiff is pure lethal
and my banter is pure naughty.'

02:14.367 --> 02:16.267
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:31.100 --> 02:33.400
Oh, get in my belly!

02:33.467 --> 02:36.567
Me and the girls are tucking
into
a lovely lunch in Mambos.

02:36.633 --> 02:38.667
(phone rings)
(Sophie gasps)

02:38.733 --> 02:41.233
Anna's calling.
What the fuck does she want?

02:41.300 --> 02:43.867
Hello?
"Hi, Nathan! It's Anna."

02:43.933 --> 02:46.300
Is everything all right?
"Go home and pack."

02:46.367 --> 02:49.100
"I need yous back in the house
today." What?!

02:49.167 --> 02:51.933
What the hell, Anna!
I haven't even shaved my minge!

02:52.000 --> 02:55.900
"Pass the message on and make
sure
everyone is back and ready to
work."

02:55.967 --> 02:57.600
"Bye, girls!"
(girls) Bye!

02:57.667 --> 02:59.000
Bye, Anna! I'm a boy.

02:59.067 --> 03:02.767
I'm gonna send a message to
everybody
to get their arses into gear,

03:02.833 --> 03:05.567
including our new family member,
Abbie.

03:05.633 --> 03:07.467
Hello, you beautiful bunch.

03:07.533 --> 03:10.667
"Anna's called and she wants us
back in the house today."

03:10.733 --> 03:13.867
"Get your shit together
and get back there pronto."

03:13.933 --> 03:17.433
"See you soon, bitches!"
What the fuck is with his lips?!

03:17.500 --> 03:20.267
Like he's been necking on
with a fucking beehive!

03:20.333 --> 03:23.100
We're gonna be out tonight,

03:23.167 --> 03:26.600
so get as much carbs
in your body as you can!

03:27.567 --> 03:30.533
(mumbles)
'Fuck this parma ham finger.'

03:30.600 --> 03:34.867
I need to get home and pack, and
get
to that house. I can't fucking
wait!

03:34.933 --> 03:37.633
Hurry up, don't be long.
Love yous! Bye!

03:38.867 --> 03:41.633
I can't believe
Anna wants us back today.

03:41.700 --> 03:44.933
I'm so glad I've got my nana
here
cos I'm dead nervous,

03:45.000 --> 03:48.500
but I can't wait to get back
as a proper family member.

03:48.567 --> 03:50.400
Go and get your stuff.
I'm going!

03:52.400 --> 03:55.100
I am fucking buzzing to see
everyone,

03:55.167 --> 03:58.300
cos I've got some big news
I wanna share with the family.

04:02.067 --> 04:05.800
Bye, Barbara! I cannot wait
to get back in that house!

04:07.300 --> 04:09.800
I've got all my dresses
and all my heels,

04:09.867 --> 04:12.867
but most importantly,
I've got my ten bottles of tan.

04:14.667 --> 04:18.867
I'm gonna meet Marty at the bus
stop
cos neither of us can drive
still!

04:20.200 --> 04:23.833
Oi, oi!
Where the hell have you been?

04:23.900 --> 04:25.967
We're gonna miss the bus, you
idiot!

04:26.033 --> 04:27.633
Where is it?
I dunno.

04:29.133 --> 04:31.600
I'm so excited. I'm single,

04:31.667 --> 04:34.367
I'm ready to mingle
and I can't fucking wait.

04:34.433 --> 04:35.700
Hi, Marn!

04:38.133 --> 04:41.467
(horn honks) It is good to be
going to the house with Scott.

04:41.533 --> 04:45.067
We're gonna go in, two single
lads,
and fucking tear the place up.

04:47.133 --> 04:49.200
(horn honks)

04:49.267 --> 04:50.433
Hello, you!

04:50.500 --> 04:53.733
I'm buzzing to be with my best
friends on my way to the house.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.100
Let's go!
Yeah.

04:56.167 --> 05:00.133
(cheering, whooping)

05:02.167 --> 05:04.733
I'm really excited
I'm going back in the house

05:04.800 --> 05:07.500
as a different person, like,
you know.

05:07.567 --> 05:11.133
Chloe's got a boyfriend so that
means me and her can be friends,

05:11.200 --> 05:14.167
and I can do what I want
without any kick-offs.

05:14.233 --> 05:18.100
More me and you time?
I wanna spend more time with
you.

05:18.167 --> 05:21.100
Marty doesn't know
me and my lad didn't work out.

05:21.167 --> 05:23.900
So I am single,
but I'm not ready to tell him
yet.

05:23.967 --> 05:26.333
I don't want things for me and
him
to change.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.267
I just wanna play it cool,
not get hurt again.

05:30.333 --> 05:31.533
You're in charge.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.033
I'm buzzing to get back,

05:33.100 --> 05:37.633
but last time round, Scott
mugged me
off, so I am nervous to see him.

05:37.700 --> 05:41.300
I'm an independent, strong
woman.
You are.

05:41.367 --> 05:44.267
And that's why you take after
Nana.
(laughs)

05:45.333 --> 05:48.367
Excited to be going back?
Fucking... Course I am, mate.

05:48.433 --> 05:53.267
Never heard from Gaz. I'm gonna
find
out where he is, the skinny
'nana!

05:53.333 --> 05:55.800
"Please leave your message
after the tone."

05:55.867 --> 05:59.133
All right, hedgehog! Me and
Aaron
are on our way to the house.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.467
I guess you don't need a lift.
Get your fucking arse there!

06:02.533 --> 06:04.800
(growls)
(laughs)

06:07.367 --> 06:10.433
I cannot fucking wait for this!
Run, Martin!

06:12.633 --> 06:15.900
Wow! This is amazing!

06:15.967 --> 06:17.967
Me and Marty are first to
arrive.

06:18.033 --> 06:20.833
It's so colourful,
it looks like an art gallery.

06:20.900 --> 06:24.833
The new bin looks like a
spaceship!
It looks like a dildo!

06:26.733 --> 06:30.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Chloe, games
room!
We've got our own bar!

06:30.867 --> 06:34.433
Anna has pulled it out of the
bag.
This house is fucking amazing.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.533
Is that a chicken on the
fucking pillow? (they laugh)

06:37.600 --> 06:41.400
They're everywhere, cocks and
pussies. I feel like I'm on a
farm!

06:41.467 --> 06:44.767
When other people come in,
we should pretend to shag in
there.

06:44.833 --> 06:48.233
Me and Chloe decide it would be
funny to pretend to blast.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.800
I know when these walk in
and see that, they'll be
foaming.

06:51.867 --> 06:55.067
You can't do that. I like to
make love, not just have sex!

06:56.000 --> 06:58.167
(yelling)

06:59.667 --> 07:01.600
Hello, you!

07:01.667 --> 07:04.000
Oh, my God! It looks amazing!

07:04.067 --> 07:07.267
I see bags on the floor,
but where the fuck is everybody?

07:08.600 --> 07:10.567
(Chloe moans)

07:10.633 --> 07:13.300
They're pretending to shag.
Go upstairs.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.667
They don't even care!
That was a pure fail.

07:15.733 --> 07:19.100
This is our room!
Oh, my God!

07:19.167 --> 07:20.967
We have swapped rooms.

07:21.033 --> 07:24.800
Thank God, Anna.
We have finally got more space.

07:24.867 --> 07:26.633
Haway then, top shaggers!

07:26.700 --> 07:27.767
(yelling)

07:27.833 --> 07:31.200
It's nice to see Chloe and
Marty.
When are the lads getting here?

07:31.267 --> 07:33.233
Shall we get a drink?
Yeah.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.067
Hello!
(yelling)

07:40.267 --> 07:43.133
Scotty T walked back in
with a big smile on his face,

07:43.200 --> 07:45.300
so buzzing to see the family.

07:45.367 --> 07:47.233
Hello, darling!
Hello, Marns!

07:47.300 --> 07:50.067
It's nice to see the family,
especially Marnie.

07:50.133 --> 07:52.300
Cos last time
we left as good friends.

07:52.367 --> 07:55.733
I know she's single now
and who knows what might happen?

07:55.800 --> 07:59.133
Aaron, you're looking very
handsome.
(Sophie) You look well.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.600
Aaron looks so different.

08:00.667 --> 08:04.767
He's got big muscles and he's
got
a big beard. He looks canny
good!

08:04.833 --> 08:06.800
Where's Gary?
He didn't answer.

08:06.867 --> 08:08.667
Why?
Cos he's an ignorant fart.

08:08.733 --> 08:12.600
Everyone's dead worried about
Gary,
but they need to calm down.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.633
He's probably shagging his bird!

08:14.700 --> 08:17.167
(Sophie) Aaron, go look
upstairs!

08:18.767 --> 08:20.733
Bagsies!
'What the fuck?'

08:20.800 --> 08:24.667
Anna swapped the boys' room with
the girls' room! Ooh, new
carpet!

08:25.367 --> 08:27.433
Erm,
we've got a bone to pick with
you.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.500
We've hardly spoke to you.

08:29.567 --> 08:31.767
Been spending a lot of time
with Martin.

08:31.833 --> 08:33.799
We haven't seen each other
in a while.

08:33.866 --> 08:36.133
I hope she hasn't sacked us off
for Martin.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.567
That'd be a kick
in the fucking teeth.

08:38.633 --> 08:42.866
I've heard you're gonna join the
boyfriend club with me and
Nathan.

08:42.933 --> 08:45.600
There was someone I liked
but now I'm single.

08:46.933 --> 08:48.600
He thinks you're taken?
Yeah.

08:48.667 --> 08:51.833
If you're just friends,
why does it matter if you're
single?

08:51.900 --> 08:55.500
I've only just arrived,
and Nathan is already on my
case.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.233
He needs to chill the fuck out.

08:57.300 --> 09:00.533
It shouldn't affect him
being your friend.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.400
When you say you're single
it's gonna change things.

09:03.467 --> 09:05.833
Yeah, I don't want to argue
and stuff.

09:05.900 --> 09:08.267
(boys cheering)

09:09.133 --> 09:10.867
The family is nearly complete.

09:10.933 --> 09:13.433
I wish that Gary and Abbie
would hurry up

09:13.500 --> 09:15.267
so we can go out on the Toon.

09:15.333 --> 09:19.200
Scott, what's happening with
Abbie?
Are you official on Facey-B?

09:19.267 --> 09:20.900
I haven't even spoke to her.

09:20.967 --> 09:23.733
If you think I'm gonna be
official
after last time,

09:23.800 --> 09:25.833
you must be off your fucking
barnet!

09:25.900 --> 09:29.367
I'm excited to see Abbie.
I wonder if she's still orange.

09:33.167 --> 09:35.767
Love you, bye.
Bye.

09:35.833 --> 09:38.267
As I walk to the house,
my heart is pounding.

09:40.100 --> 09:43.033
Abbie!
(cheering)

09:43.100 --> 09:44.100
Oh, my God!

09:44.167 --> 09:47.167
But as soon as I walk in,
I get the biggest welcome.

09:47.233 --> 09:50.167
Everyone is excited to see us.
I'm buzzing.

09:50.233 --> 09:51.533
Look at the outfit!

09:51.600 --> 09:53.500
You look nice.
Very glam!

09:53.567 --> 09:55.200
Hello, kid!
Hi.

09:55.267 --> 09:59.833
Scott gives us the biggest hug.
I'm so relieved it's not
awkward.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.500
It was only 2.99!

10:02.567 --> 10:05.367
I'm just gonna let her crack on
and do her own thing.

10:05.433 --> 10:07.767
I don't want a relationship
in the house.

10:07.833 --> 10:10.200
Know why? Cos I'm a fucking
slag.

10:10.267 --> 10:13.267
Are you buzzing to be back?
Yeah, I'm really excited.

10:17.633 --> 10:19.167
To the family!

10:19.233 --> 10:23.600
(yelling, cheering)

10:23.667 --> 10:26.267
Let's get ready for the Toon!
Whoo!

10:28.867 --> 10:30.533
It's just Gaz that's missing.

10:30.600 --> 10:34.367
He might be the dad of the
group,
but us kids can't wait for him.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.933
It's time to get ready
for a family night out.

10:41.767 --> 10:44.000
Me and Marty
are freshening up for tonight

10:44.067 --> 10:48.533
and Scott hasn't even topped up
his bronzer. What's up with him?

10:48.600 --> 10:50.767
Are you gonna get ready?
Nah, mate.

10:50.833 --> 10:53.667
What's the matter?
My back's fucking killing me.

10:53.733 --> 10:54.900
Absolute agony.

10:54.967 --> 10:58.200
It must just be all those years
of canoodling in the sack,

10:58.267 --> 11:00.233
it's finally taken its fucking
toll!

11:00.300 --> 11:03.267
Scott, sort your fucking self
out,
will you?

11:03.333 --> 11:06.567
(laughs) It's only a bad back.
Probably getting arthritis.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.933
Scott isn't even coming out!

11:16.000 --> 11:18.667
He said he's not coming,
"Because me back hurts."

11:18.733 --> 11:19.967
A bad back?

11:20.033 --> 11:24.433
Why is Scott such a pussy?
Have a Gaviscon and you'll be
cush!

11:25.633 --> 11:29.067
Aaron!
(yelling)

11:29.133 --> 11:31.700
I need to tell these radgies
some big news.

11:31.767 --> 11:35.133
I'm not sure how they'll take
it.
They'll probably be shocked.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.267
I need to tell yous something.

11:37.333 --> 11:40.267
In just over a week's time
I'm gonna be fighting MMA.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.367
Go on then, son.

11:43.033 --> 11:46.167
I don't know how I feel.
I care about him so much.

11:46.233 --> 11:48.433
I hope he knows what he's doing.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.033
We'll have the banners.

11:50.100 --> 11:53.133
I can't wait to have the support
of all these divvies.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.967
Do it for the team!
(all) Aaron!

11:56.033 --> 12:00.100
But for now I need to give Abbie
a family night to remember.

12:00.167 --> 12:02.600
(Nathan) Bye, Scott! Mattress
back!

12:02.667 --> 12:04.067
Family!

12:08.133 --> 12:09.867
Tonight is family night,

12:09.933 --> 12:13.200
which means just getting drunk
and having a laugh.

12:19.267 --> 12:20.967
We all get a round of shots in.

12:21.033 --> 12:24.500
Seeing as though it's my first
night, I think I deserve two!

12:28.867 --> 12:30.467
(cheering)

12:32.767 --> 12:33.833
For fuck's sake.

12:35.967 --> 12:38.100
Stop right there.
I'm starting to think

12:38.167 --> 12:41.467
this isn't what a bird would do
in a relationship.

12:41.533 --> 12:43.467
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:45.967 --> 12:46.167
.

12:48.733 --> 12:48.933
.

12:58.067 --> 13:00.800
This is our first night out.
The drinks are flowing.

13:00.867 --> 13:04.100
We're all having a good dance.
It's so good to be back!

13:07.300 --> 13:09.700
I know Chloe thinks
she's the best dancer,

13:09.767 --> 13:12.133
but I'm gonna give her
a run for her money.

13:17.333 --> 13:21.333
Never thought I'd say it, but
Abbie
is a shitter dancer than Chloe.

13:23.133 --> 13:26.833
Just cos you're losing doesn't
mean
you need to kick us in the
fanny!

13:26.900 --> 13:28.567
This thing is precious.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.667
With the other lads not being
here,

13:35.733 --> 13:39.267
it's actually nice to spend
some quality time with Martin.

13:46.267 --> 13:49.667
Nathan, get them inflatable lips
away from me now.

13:55.600 --> 13:59.167
Me and Chloe are dancing,
grinding
and that. I'm starting to think,

13:59.233 --> 14:03.067
this isn't what a bird would do
when they're in a relationship.

14:10.467 --> 14:14.400
Marty does look really happy
that
I'm single, but what does this
mean?

14:14.467 --> 14:18.600
I thought Marty wanted to be
friends
but maybe he wants to be more!

14:25.333 --> 14:28.333
This makes things
a little bit more difficult.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.967
I wouldn't want to ruin what
we've
got over a daft fucking shag.

14:35.967 --> 14:40.433
(Abbie) I am having a wicked
night,
but I'm so confused about Scott.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.300
I still don't know where I
stand.

14:45.867 --> 14:48.567
Abbie needs to realise
Scott is all about fanny.

14:48.633 --> 14:51.800
He talks about it that much,
he nearly looks like one!

14:55.667 --> 14:57.967
I understand what Chloe is
saying,

14:58.033 --> 15:00.933
but you can't help it
if you like someone.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.833
Eh? What the fuck has salad
got to do with Scott?

15:27.500 --> 15:29.700
Even though I find Aaron
so attractive,

15:29.767 --> 15:32.000
we're best mates
above anything else.

15:36.767 --> 15:38.767
Me and Marnie are in a good
place.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.900
It's amazing to know
she still cares.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.267
We've been down that road before
and it never ends well,

15:51.333 --> 15:52.700
so stop right there.

15:53.733 --> 15:57.367
I love Marnie and Aaron,
maybe not in a relationship,

15:57.433 --> 16:00.967
but even they have got to admit
that they look wicked together.

16:12.233 --> 16:13.533
Dream on, Marty.

16:13.600 --> 16:19.133
It will take a lot more than
your
eyebrows to get me necking with
you.

16:20.733 --> 16:22.800
Marty is playing with Abbie.

16:22.867 --> 16:27.133
I've got a bit of a suggestion
and I want to see how he reacts.

16:32.300 --> 16:36.367
Why is Chloe telling me to get
with Abbie? She'd kick off if I
did.

16:38.967 --> 16:42.800
Chloe randomly tells Martin
if he wants to get with Abbie he
can,

16:42.867 --> 16:46.633
when I know if he does that,
it'll be
world war, whatever we're up to.

16:53.233 --> 16:56.433
I'm only testing to see if Marty
would neck on with Abbie

16:56.500 --> 16:59.333
cos if they did,
I would be bothered, I would.

17:11.300 --> 17:15.200
I've had so much fun and it's
so good to be back with
everyone,

17:15.267 --> 17:18.599
but now it's time to head back
to the house and have some
scran.

17:22.500 --> 17:26.867
If yous two want to get it on,
you can get it on. Who, us two?

17:26.933 --> 17:31.600
What the fuck is Chloe on about?
I like Scott, not Marty.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.033
She must be way more mortal
than I thought.

17:38.900 --> 17:39.900
OK.

17:39.967 --> 17:42.267
Now I've heard it
from both Marty and Abbie,

17:42.333 --> 17:45.633
we all know where we stand,
especially you, Marty.

17:51.167 --> 17:53.200
It wouldn't be the first night
back

17:53.267 --> 17:56.000
if we didn't burst through the
door
mortal drunk

17:56.067 --> 17:59.200
with enough pizza and kebab
to feed the whole of Newcastle.

17:59.267 --> 18:01.000
I wonder if Scott wants some.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.967
Let's have some couscous!

18:03.033 --> 18:06.033
I'm in bed, minding my own
business
having a nice dream.

18:06.100 --> 18:10.500
Then I'm getting woke up by
these
fucking divvies. What a liberty!

18:10.567 --> 18:12.733
(all yelling indistinctly)

18:12.800 --> 18:15.333
It's killing me
watching them all tuck in.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.600
I can't touch it
with my training diet.

18:19.767 --> 18:23.200
I'm mortal and I've missed
Scotty,
so I'm gonna check up on him

18:23.267 --> 18:25.633
and see if he wants
to share my burger,

18:25.700 --> 18:27.500
and maybe get a cuddle
goodnight.

18:29.267 --> 18:33.367
Abbie's walked straight upstairs
to see Scott. Fucking hell. Beg
much?

18:33.433 --> 18:35.200
Do you want a burger?
(mumbles)

18:35.267 --> 18:36.867
No? OK.

18:36.933 --> 18:40.600
Well, I think we should
just have a cuddle.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.900
Abbie's asking for a cuddle,

18:42.967 --> 18:46.700
but that's the last thing I can
think about when my back is
fucked,

18:46.767 --> 18:50.467
and when she's trying to jam
half
a cheeseburger in my fucking
gob.

18:50.533 --> 18:52.300
Cuddle?

18:52.367 --> 18:54.867
No, you've gotta actually move.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.367
Scott is being so boring,

18:57.433 --> 18:59.533
so I'm gonna see
what the others are up to

18:59.600 --> 19:01.700
and hopefully carry on the
party.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.967
(Marty shouts indistinctly)

19:04.033 --> 19:06.133
Me and Chloe had a fat kebab,

19:06.200 --> 19:08.833
and now we're thinking
we'll dive in the hot tub

19:08.900 --> 19:10.700
cos we stink of meat sweats.

19:12.533 --> 19:13.700
Ooh! Hot tub.

19:16.767 --> 19:19.533
I'm mortal and Marty is naked.

19:19.600 --> 19:23.933
I told him I was single, so
there's
no harm in a bit of cheeky
flirting.

19:26.167 --> 19:29.067
Wow, I feel like a third wheel.
Awkward.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.367
Chloe is touching my willy.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.000
That's not what friends do,
babe.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.800
Chloe needs to start being
honest,
especially with her best
friends,

19:52.867 --> 19:54.533
because it's doing my head in.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.800
Where's Frankenstein going?

20:00.033 --> 20:02.067
What was she saying about Marty?

20:10.100 --> 20:14.667
Fuck's sake. I'm fed up with
Chloe
saying one thing then doing
another.

20:14.733 --> 20:16.567
She did the same thing with
Scott.

20:16.633 --> 20:19.600
I had to defend her,
and I won't let her do it again.

20:19.667 --> 20:22.967
If you by chance, if it did
happen
and she kicked off,

20:23.033 --> 20:25.533
I'll 100% guarantee you now
I'll have your back.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.533
Although I'd never get with
Marty
in a million years,

20:28.600 --> 20:30.933
it's nice to know that Nathan
has got my back.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.200
Bedtime!

20:36.933 --> 20:39.967
Me and Marnie are both single.
At this moment in time,

20:40.033 --> 20:42.800
we're getting on better
than we ever have before.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.133
Sophie, it's getting light
outside!

20:48.033 --> 20:49.767
(laughter)

20:49.833 --> 20:53.067
It's difficult being in this
house
cos I wanna have fun

20:53.133 --> 20:55.367
but I should be focusing
on my training.

21:01.467 --> 21:04.433
Hi, Anna! She looks like a
vagina.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.933
I swear to God.
She was trying to sit on top of
us.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.567
The girl is lying.
I'll say something.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.633
Danger is my middle name.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.300
I'm single and we're getting on
better than ever.

21:15.767 --> 21:17.600
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

21:20.467 --> 21:20.667
.

21:23.200 --> 21:23.400
.

21:37.967 --> 21:42.100
I've just woke up,
and I feel like fucking shit.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.267
I was in the hot tub with Chloe.

21:44.333 --> 21:46.767
She was fucking trying
to sit on top of us.

21:46.833 --> 21:49.400
Fuck this, I'm off.
Just shot her down?

21:49.467 --> 21:51.433
Chloe's come out of a
relationship.

21:51.500 --> 21:54.633
Usually, I love nothing fucking
more
than being a rebound,

21:54.700 --> 21:57.033
but not to one of my best mates.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.733
It's weird without Gaz.

21:59.667 --> 22:03.433
I hope Gaz decides to get in
touch.
I don't know where he is.

22:03.500 --> 22:07.133
I'm buzzing to see his face when
he
realises he's back in the shit
bed.

22:08.867 --> 22:10.567
(all laugh)

22:14.400 --> 22:15.533
Oh, my God!

22:15.600 --> 22:20.500
I feel so ill. The only thing
what
will cheer me up is my chicken
hat.

22:20.567 --> 22:22.367
Chicken!

22:22.433 --> 22:24.633
Abbie, how was your night?

22:24.700 --> 22:28.667
When I first came in, I was
nervous,
but it was a really good night.

22:28.733 --> 22:31.633
It's really nice to wake up
with Abbie in the room.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.267
I feel like she's getting
a lot more confident.

22:34.333 --> 22:37.367
I think she will fit in really
well.

22:37.433 --> 22:39.000
Did you miss Scott last night?

22:39.067 --> 22:42.300
Yeah, cos, like, we always have
good crack and banter.

22:42.367 --> 22:44.767
I am loving
getting to know the family
better,

22:44.833 --> 22:47.167
but I just wish that Scott
was out last night

22:47.233 --> 22:49.100
so I could've had a cheeky
flirt.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.500
What cures a hangover, ladies?

22:51.567 --> 22:54.500
Cock!
No, breakfast!

22:54.567 --> 22:56.400
Breakfast!
I'm starving!

22:59.467 --> 23:02.867
The whole squad's going for
breakfast. My back's fucked,

23:02.933 --> 23:06.433
but if you think I'm missing
out,
you've got another thing coming.

23:06.500 --> 23:07.733
I need a walking stick.

23:11.067 --> 23:13.133
I'm doing my best
to stay on my diet.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.633
What the fuck
am I gonna eat in here?

23:15.700 --> 23:18.100
That's mine.
Get your protein.

23:18.167 --> 23:21.567
Aaron is eating five eggs
and a jacket potato for
breakfast.

23:21.633 --> 23:24.500
His farts are gonna
fucking stink after this.

23:24.567 --> 23:28.300
(Sophie) I can't believe you're
doing
this. Fucking eggs, training.

23:28.367 --> 23:29.767
Be worth it when I win.

23:29.833 --> 23:33.633
I love being back, but it's not
easy
to keep my training on track.

23:33.700 --> 23:36.167
Right now, I'm torn between the
two.

23:36.233 --> 23:38.867
(farts)
Oh, you're fucking kidding?!

23:38.933 --> 23:42.867
Scott, I've not even finished
my potato and you're farting.

23:42.933 --> 23:45.800
Scott, food and farting don't
mix,

23:45.867 --> 23:47.933
so it's time
to get back to the house.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.500
It's just a shame that me and
him
haven't spoken all morning.

24:00.500 --> 24:01.767
(sighs)

24:04.067 --> 24:07.733
We get back and who's sitting
there
with a face like a smacked arse?

24:07.800 --> 24:09.567
Fucking Anna.

24:09.633 --> 24:11.467
Hi, Anna!
Hello, Chloe.

24:11.533 --> 24:15.067
Looking lovely in your pink top.
You look like a big fanny.

24:15.133 --> 24:18.067
About time Anna turned up.
But what's she wearing?!

24:18.133 --> 24:19.633
She looks like a vagina!

24:19.700 --> 24:23.033
The house is looking marvellous.
No, it's an absolute mess!

24:23.100 --> 24:26.033
Anna, just because
you're dressed as a twat,

24:26.100 --> 24:28.700
it doesn't mean
you have to act like one.

24:28.767 --> 24:32.733
You're here to work. I've got
a new business venture for us.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.800
It's called Toon Tours.

24:34.867 --> 24:37.767
You're checking out new things
the Toon has to offer.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.267
(cheering)

24:39.333 --> 24:41.400
There's no one better
than us Geordies

24:41.467 --> 24:43.233
showing anyone around the Toon.

24:43.300 --> 24:46.000
We know the ins and the outs.
Oi, oi!

24:46.067 --> 24:47.767
You've got an activity today.

24:47.833 --> 24:51.267
Sophie, Nathan, Marty.
Yes!

24:51.333 --> 24:54.267
I love going to work, swear
down!

24:54.333 --> 24:57.200
Wear those T-shirts.
You're going paddle boarding.

24:57.267 --> 24:58.667
What?

24:58.733 --> 25:00.167
(laughter)

25:00.233 --> 25:03.667
I'm scared! This is the last
thing
I'd ever think of doing.

25:05.667 --> 25:07.600
We've got to go to work.

25:07.667 --> 25:09.567
You can tidy the house!
Oh, yeah?

25:09.633 --> 25:12.300
Those lips will keep you afloat!

25:16.067 --> 25:17.400
(Nathan) Right, come on!

25:21.167 --> 25:23.833
As Marnie's been worried
about me fight,

25:23.900 --> 25:28.467
I thought I'd bring her down the
gym
so she can see what I've been
doing.

25:29.567 --> 25:31.900
So I stand like this?
Like that.

25:31.967 --> 25:36.167
Me and Aaron have gone to gym
and I
feel like I'm doing all the
punching.

25:36.233 --> 25:39.167
I think Aaron might be a little
shy.

25:40.500 --> 25:44.133
(yells)
(laughs)

25:44.200 --> 25:46.800
All of 30 seconds
and you're fucking knackered.

25:46.867 --> 25:50.333
We're always giggling together
and I just love it.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.567
Last time in the house,
I had a boyfriend.

25:52.633 --> 25:56.033
Even though me and Aaron were
friends, it was hard to talk to
him.

25:56.100 --> 25:58.067
I'm happy that this time I'm
single

25:58.133 --> 26:00.300
and we're getting on
better than ever.

26:00.367 --> 26:02.533
I just want the fight over.

26:02.600 --> 26:06.333
I've been doing a lot of
thinking
and my head is a mess.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.900
Marnie's my best mate.
I need to talk to her.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.800
I'm struggling to be myself in
there
and enjoy it, then also do
training.

26:13.867 --> 26:16.567
I have to leave
cos I can't train in here.

26:16.633 --> 26:20.167
I can't believe Aaron is leaving
the house until after the fight.

26:20.233 --> 26:24.433
He needs to do what he needs to
do,
but I'm gutted. We've just got
here!

26:24.500 --> 26:28.033
You've got our support and we're
always going to be there for ya.

26:28.100 --> 26:31.033
Looking at Marnie's face
does break me heart a bit.

26:31.100 --> 26:34.200
But on fight night when I win,
it's gonna be all worth it.

26:34.267 --> 26:36.700
This time, slams! Keep your bum
in.

26:38.133 --> 26:39.367
Right, go!

26:39.433 --> 26:43.667
Six, five, four.
Where's three, two, one?

26:43.733 --> 26:45.633
I'm done! I'm done!

26:45.700 --> 26:47.633
You sure?
Let's just go.

26:50.033 --> 26:53.867
We're going paddle boarding, and
while Sophie's having a nervous
poo,

26:53.933 --> 26:58.367
I'm gonna grill Martin about
what's going on with him and
Chloe.

26:58.433 --> 27:01.700
What I did find weird last
night,
she came over between us like,

27:01.767 --> 27:03.867
"If you wanna get with Abbie,
you can."

27:03.933 --> 27:06.433
This is the perfect opportunity
to tell Nathan

27:06.500 --> 27:09.000
that Chloe tried to crack on
with us last night.

27:09.067 --> 27:12.133
Then we got in the hot tub
and she tried to sit on us.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.533
She did that thing where
you go to kiss someone like
that.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.633
What?! Chloe tried to get it on
with Martin in the hot tub?

27:18.700 --> 27:21.033
Since me and Chloe
have drifted apart,

27:21.100 --> 27:24.167
I'm starting to see things
from a different perspective.

27:24.233 --> 27:26.533
I've got no interest
in getting with Chloe.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.733
Right, yous. Come on.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.633
Anna's got a new business
adventure,
Toon Tours,

27:33.700 --> 27:36.867
and she's starting off
with us going paddle boarding.

27:36.933 --> 27:39.267
What the fuck is paddle
boarding?

27:39.333 --> 27:41.500
(shouting)

27:41.567 --> 27:44.400
I'm gonna smash this.
Danger is my middle name.

27:46.100 --> 27:50.200
Martin's legs are shaking like a
shitting dog. I want him to fall
in!

27:50.267 --> 27:52.733
(cheering)

27:52.800 --> 27:55.533
(laughter)

27:55.600 --> 27:58.033
Yes!
(yells)

27:58.100 --> 28:00.967
The only way I can do it
is to be on all fours,

28:01.033 --> 28:03.567
cos I'm always comfortable
in that position.

28:03.633 --> 28:06.033
(groans)
She looks like she's having a
shit!

28:06.100 --> 28:11.033
The thrill of a near-death
experience
is kind of turning me on.

28:11.100 --> 28:14.700
I'm gonna give it a try.
Oh, my God! I'm gonna capsize!

28:14.767 --> 28:16.600
Stand up! Stand up!

28:16.667 --> 28:18.367
Stand up, Nathan. Go on!

28:19.567 --> 28:21.167
(yells)

28:21.233 --> 28:24.533
(laughter)

28:24.600 --> 28:26.433
I haven't learnt about
landmarks.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.533
The only thing I've learnt
is the Tyne water is stinking.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.733
I wouldn't recommend anyone
drinking it.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.000
We're waiting for the workers

28:39.067 --> 28:41.333
when I spot Chloe
wearing Nathan's jumper.

28:46.567 --> 28:50.067
Nathan hates people touching his
shit
so he'll fucking hate this.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.100
(gasps) Car.

28:56.167 --> 28:59.767
I can't wait to see Nathan's
face
when he sees us wearing his
clothes.

28:59.833 --> 29:02.567
He never lends us them.
He deserves this.

29:04.167 --> 29:06.400
Hello.
(all) Hi!

29:06.467 --> 29:09.633
What the fuck are you doing
with my jumper on?!

29:09.700 --> 29:11.600
And you've got my top on!

29:11.667 --> 29:13.867
(laughter)

29:13.933 --> 29:15.967
What the actual fuck?

29:16.033 --> 29:18.867
Get that off, get that off,
I've wore that!

29:18.933 --> 29:20.833
Nathan is fuming.

29:20.900 --> 29:24.233
I better get this T-shirt off
before I get any tan on it.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.567
What yous been doing?
We went to the gym.

29:26.633 --> 29:28.333
Still training, Aaron?

29:28.400 --> 29:30.700
Time to tell the family
that I'm leaving.

29:30.767 --> 29:34.133
I am gutted, but I want them
to be proud when I win.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.633
I can't train in here.

29:35.700 --> 29:39.067
I'm going to pack my stuff
and go back to Birmingham and
train.

29:39.133 --> 29:40.733
I'll see yous on fight night.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.467
Aaron's told us he's gonna
leave.
What the fuck?

29:43.533 --> 29:46.967
If I stayed in here,
I wouldn't be able to perform.

29:47.033 --> 29:49.567
It's the best thing for you.

29:49.633 --> 29:53.333
I'm devastated that Aaron is
leaving
but I can't wait for the fight.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.333
I just hope that he wins.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.500
(cheering)

29:56.567 --> 29:58.433
I'm gonna go pack!

30:03.033 --> 30:05.933
One, two! Ah, man!

30:06.000 --> 30:09.333
(all chanting) Aaron! Aaron!
Aaron!
Go on, Aaron!

30:09.400 --> 30:11.967
Right, see yous on fight night.

30:12.033 --> 30:14.600
It's a shame
cos mine and Marnie's friendship

30:14.667 --> 30:18.367
is getting stronger and
stronger,
but I need to focus on me
training.

30:18.433 --> 30:20.633
I'll see these radgies
come fight night.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.833
(cheering)

30:24.433 --> 30:28.467
You know when people fight and
stuff, y'know they can't have
sex.

30:28.533 --> 30:31.900
If he wins you have to give
him...
I am a good friend.

30:31.967 --> 30:35.867
I have to admit if Aaron comes
back
a winner, I'll find it really
sexy.

30:35.933 --> 30:39.367
Who knows what might happen?
Let's get ready. We're going
out!

30:42.600 --> 30:45.967
It's not the same without Aaron
and Gaz, but we need to crack on

30:46.033 --> 30:49.333
and have a good night,
cos I'm on the pull tonight!

30:50.933 --> 30:53.967
Is Scott better?
He's not hisself, is he?

30:54.033 --> 30:56.567
I really hope Scotty
is coming out tonight.

30:56.633 --> 30:59.933
I can't wait another night
without talking to him.

31:00.967 --> 31:03.200
You coming out tonight?
Nah. Again?!

31:03.267 --> 31:06.767
I'm dying for a drink, but I
cannae
go when my back is this fucked.

31:06.833 --> 31:09.367
The lads are gonna have to
look after the girls.

31:09.433 --> 31:11.267
Marty, good luck to you, kid.

31:11.333 --> 31:15.333
How do you think you've done
that?
The only thing I did was shag.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.600
(laughs)

31:20.100 --> 31:21.867
Where is Scott?!

31:21.933 --> 31:24.233
He's not coming out cos of his
back.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.567
(Abbie) He's not coming out?
No.

31:26.633 --> 31:28.267
He's not coming out again?

31:28.333 --> 31:30.800
All I wanna do is talk to
Scotty.

31:30.867 --> 31:33.033
So I'm thinking I should do it
now.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.867
I'm gonna go and talk to him.
Are you coming?

31:35.933 --> 31:38.800
Yeah, I've got no knickers on.
Easy access.

31:40.600 --> 31:44.300
I don't feel like he's put
effort
in. He's not interested in her.

31:44.367 --> 31:45.567
Cos he shagged her.

31:45.633 --> 31:49.567
Do you want me to rest with ya?
Are you not ready to go out?

31:49.633 --> 31:52.233
I feel like we need to talk.
What about?!

31:52.300 --> 31:54.800
Eh?! "We need to talk."
What's the crack here?

31:54.867 --> 31:59.000
If that's a code word for "drop
me
kegs", babes, I've got a bad
back.

31:59.067 --> 32:01.633
But you never know when Turbo T
can be tempted.

32:04.267 --> 32:06.400
I'm nervous about
telling the others,

32:06.467 --> 32:08.933
but if they were in my boots,
they'd do the same.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.200
This could be bad.

32:11.267 --> 32:14.300
Guys, I think
I'm gonna stay with Scott.

32:14.367 --> 32:15.933
You fucking kidding?
What?!

32:16.033 --> 32:20.100
What the hell? What happened
to chicks before dicks?

32:21.067 --> 32:22.300
Keep the pussy tight!

32:22.367 --> 32:26.433
Scott and Abbie can stay and
have
their romantic cosy cuddle
together.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.933
We're all gonna get fucking
mortal.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.767
Tonight, I'm getting
ridiculously drunk.

32:36.167 --> 32:37.900
Mama.

32:39.300 --> 32:42.100
Aw... shite.

32:43.467 --> 32:45.767
The girl is a bullshitter.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.967
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

32:50.967 --> 32:51.167
.

32:53.667 --> 32:53.867
.

33:02.333 --> 33:05.233
We get to Illegitimate
and the place is bouncing.

33:05.300 --> 33:08.100
Tonight I'm getting
ridiculously drunk.

33:23.867 --> 33:26.733
It's only the second night
and Abbie should be with us,

33:26.800 --> 33:28.900
not wasting her time with Scott.

33:28.967 --> 33:31.200
I hope she gets a finger out of
it,
though.

33:36.333 --> 33:38.000
Cheers for staying in.

33:38.067 --> 33:40.700
I'm really excited
to have a night in with Scott.

33:40.767 --> 33:44.567
Tonight will be the first night
we can finally get some alone
time.

33:44.633 --> 33:47.833
I know we haven't spoke properly
so I just wanted to see...

33:47.900 --> 33:50.167
Cos obviously I still do like
ya...
Do you?

33:51.867 --> 33:54.833
Aw... shite.

33:54.900 --> 33:58.000
It's your first time in the
house,
so have fun.

33:58.067 --> 33:59.567
Go out for the pull.

33:59.633 --> 34:03.567
I think it's better when it's
like that, just chilled out...
Yeah.

34:03.633 --> 34:07.233
I've put me heart out on the
line
with Scott and his response was

34:07.300 --> 34:10.199
that he still wants us both
to get with other people.

34:10.266 --> 34:15.833
I might get a Jacuzzi if you
fancy it. I'll go in the
Jacuzzi.

34:15.900 --> 34:19.033
Maybe if Scott sees us in a
bikini,
he might change his mind.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.367
God loves a trier.

34:29.533 --> 34:33.699
Abbie's looking all right
tonight,
and I've got a Toblerone in my
kegs.

34:34.833 --> 34:37.167
There's nowt wrong
with a little neck on.

34:40.266 --> 34:45.033
Scott's kissed us. That must
mean
that deep down he still likes
us.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.833
That boy has got a hold over me.

34:49.067 --> 34:52.199
These bubbles are going berserk
and so's my fucking chod.

34:52.266 --> 34:56.699
So I need to get myself to bed
before
I get tempted to do anything
else.

35:04.233 --> 35:07.033
I can't believe I missed a night
out
with the family

35:07.100 --> 35:09.900
to spend with a boy
that doesn't even like us back.

35:09.967 --> 35:12.033
You're not staying in the bed.
I'm not.

35:12.100 --> 35:14.233
Why you lying in it?
I'm just chilling.

35:14.300 --> 35:17.767
All I want is a good night's
sleep
to get me back better.

35:17.833 --> 35:20.700
Cannae get much sleep
with a baseball bat in me pants.

35:22.700 --> 35:24.833
I feel like I may as well
open up a bakery

35:24.900 --> 35:27.067
with the amount of pies
I've been given.

35:27.133 --> 35:28.933
I'm off to bed.

35:37.733 --> 35:39.633
Where's my drink?

35:39.700 --> 35:40.900
Oh, my God!

35:42.400 --> 35:46.933
I don't think I've ever been
in the house when Aaron hasn't.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.600
I hope he hurries back soon.

35:55.833 --> 35:58.233
Me and Martin
got on great today at work

35:58.300 --> 36:01.333
and tonight, our bromance
has gone to the next level.

36:01.400 --> 36:05.333
There's no other lads here,
so let's be lads together.

36:11.567 --> 36:14.933
The way Chloe has been acting
towards Martin is winding me up.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.567
I wonder what she'll say when
she finds out Martin's on the
pull.

36:24.667 --> 36:29.000
Chloe says she's OK with Marty
pulling, but is she really?

36:29.067 --> 36:30.967
Oh, here he is!

36:31.033 --> 36:33.833
Right, Martin,
Chloe said she's fine with it.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.900
So, let's neck these drinks
and then go on the pull.

36:41.567 --> 36:44.800
Marty's gone on the pull
and I'm fine with that,

36:44.867 --> 36:48.800
but I don't know how I feel
about
my friend helping him. It's
weird.

36:51.900 --> 36:54.800
I don't think Nathan's
thinking this through.

36:54.867 --> 36:56.300
That's not fair on Chloe.

36:58.967 --> 37:01.267
Even though Marty
seems desperate to pull,

37:01.333 --> 37:04.133
I want to be that calm and cool
ex.

37:05.267 --> 37:07.067
Calm and cool.

37:13.400 --> 37:17.600
Me and Chloe are getting on.
She's
happy for us to go on the pull.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.433
What's going on? This is heaven!

37:25.800 --> 37:29.633
I wish I could say I was telling
the truth, but I do fancy Marty.

37:29.700 --> 37:33.133
I may sleep with him again,
but I don't want him to know
that.

37:38.300 --> 37:41.733
I think Chloe's saying to me
that she'll never shag us again,

37:41.800 --> 37:45.067
so I'll try and shag her,
like a reverse psychology thing.

37:47.567 --> 37:51.100
Hang on. Chloe's cornered Martin
when he's meant to be on the
pull.

37:51.167 --> 37:54.233
I knew she was lying
when she said she was all right.

37:54.300 --> 37:56.067
The girl is a bullshitter.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.967
I'm pissed off
that she can't leave him to it,

38:02.033 --> 38:05.700
especially after everything
that Martin has told me today.

38:08.833 --> 38:13.000
Me and Marty were talking and he
walked off and gone on the pull.

38:13.067 --> 38:15.533
That's the only thing
he can think about.

38:19.900 --> 38:21.967
I know that I'm really drunk,

38:22.033 --> 38:24.967
but I've got a massive bone
to pick with Chloe.

38:28.300 --> 38:31.633
Nathan is accusing me of trying
to get with Marty last night.

38:31.700 --> 38:34.067
Why is he getting involved?
Nae-one else is!

38:41.333 --> 38:45.067
Not only do I think she's lying,
I'm still pissed off that last
night

38:45.133 --> 38:47.267
she told Martin
he could get with Abbie.

38:47.333 --> 38:50.267
When if he did,
she'd only end up kicking off.

38:55.733 --> 38:59.733
I know that Nathan's very
passionate
about Chloe, but this isn't
nice.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.700
He's getting a bit too angry.

39:07.533 --> 39:11.033
The words won't stop coming
out of my mouth. I have no
control.

39:24.267 --> 39:28.300
Me and Nathan have had rows
before,
but this one's different.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.800
This one is massive.

39:38.867 --> 39:41.167
Nathan's been really nasty
to us tonight.

39:41.233 --> 39:44.233
To make things worse,
Marty's brought a girl in the
area.

39:44.300 --> 39:46.567
I cannot be arsed with this,
like.

39:50.233 --> 39:53.967
This bird is fit and she's
giving us off all sorts of
vibes.

39:56.333 --> 40:00.000
Wait a second.
Is Marty sucking that girl's
tit?

40:04.233 --> 40:05.667
Mama.

40:08.867 --> 40:11.433
This night
is a total fucking disaster.

40:14.867 --> 40:18.200
Before anything else kicks off,
let's get back to the house.

40:31.067 --> 40:34.800
I'm in the taxi with this bird
and Chloe's there and it's
awkward.

40:39.900 --> 40:41.833
Chloe's letting her mouth go.

40:41.900 --> 40:45.333
She's obviously pissed off
that Marty is bringing a girl
back.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.867
Nathan, shut your fucking mouth!

40:47.933 --> 40:52.133
I thought Chloe was all right
with
me pulling. What is her problem?

40:52.200 --> 40:55.200
(yelling)

40:55.267 --> 40:58.200
You wanted Martin to go on the
pull,
so why be nasty?

40:58.267 --> 41:00.467
I swear to God. No, fuck that!

41:00.533 --> 41:03.500
I can't be in this taxi
a fucking second longer.

41:03.567 --> 41:05.800
Get me the fuck out of here now!

41:06.733 --> 41:09.500
All this over a bird.
It's embarrassing!

41:09.567 --> 41:12.400
Don't talk to me ever again!

41:12.467 --> 41:16.100
I'm mortal and Marty's pulled,
and of course I'm pissed off.

41:16.167 --> 41:18.500
My so-called best friend
helped him to pull.

41:20.533 --> 41:24.667
I promise you one thing, and
this is a promise I'm gonna
keep.

41:24.733 --> 41:27.933
I will never kiss her in this
house.
Exactly, Marty.

41:37.100 --> 41:40.733
We get back and Scotty is up,
but where the fuck is Abbie?

41:40.800 --> 41:44.400
Yous mortal?
Scott, why are you awake?

41:44.467 --> 41:46.533
Where's Abbie?
She's in bed.

41:46.600 --> 41:50.167
Things obviously haven't went
well
if he's up and she's in bed,

41:50.233 --> 41:52.000
but I have missed her tonight.

41:52.067 --> 41:55.433
So I'm gonna tell her
exactly what's happened.

41:56.533 --> 41:59.633
You OK?
No, I'm not. I'm in shock.

41:59.700 --> 42:03.267
Chloe is in bits. It looks like
she needs a shoulder to cry on.

42:03.333 --> 42:06.500
Martin got a girl in the club.
Did he?

42:06.567 --> 42:08.233
Yeah, and he was all over her.

42:08.300 --> 42:11.500
I'm really upset about Nathan,
but the more I think about it,

42:11.567 --> 42:13.500
I'm really upset about Marty,
too.

42:17.033 --> 42:19.100
Haven't you?
(sobs)

42:19.167 --> 42:22.300
Seeing Marty all over another
girl
is absolutely shit.

42:22.367 --> 42:25.833
It hurts us to think, why
wouldn't
he wanna be like that with me?

42:25.900 --> 42:31.533
He would care...
more about a shag than me.

42:40.333 --> 42:43.433
We get back to the house
and there's no sign of Chloe,

42:43.500 --> 42:46.567
so me and this bird
are going straight to the shag
pad.

42:46.633 --> 42:51.267
I just hope I don't end up
with a glass back like Scott.

42:51.333 --> 42:54.333
Tonight,
mine and Chloe's relationship

42:54.400 --> 42:56.100
has taken a turn for the worse.

42:56.167 --> 42:59.667
I just need to get to bed
and get some sleep.

43:02.933 --> 43:07.300
I've fallen out with my best
friend
and Marty is shagging another
lass.

43:08.900 --> 43:10.900
I've had better nights, like.

43:12.700 --> 43:13.867
Ducks!

43:13.933 --> 43:18.133
Ducks are little horny bastards.
They will fit in perfectly.

43:18.200 --> 43:19.933
(cheering)

43:21.900 --> 43:24.333
Scotty's gone.
I'm going on the pull tonight.

43:26.300 --> 43:27.833
What the fuck!?

43:33.667 --> 43:37.533
I'm necking on with Nathan.
I am changing and I don't like
it.

43:39.900 --> 43:41.767
Shit!
(glass shatters)

43:41.833 --> 43:44.100
(screams indistinctly)

43:44.167 --> 43:46.967
I'm going home and I don't know
if I'm coming back.

44:15.900 --> 44:16.100
.
