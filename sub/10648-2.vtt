I've ignored it, I've denied it,
but it's... it's always been there.

You see this scar?

17:02.731 --> 17:05.646
Got it kissing some flying glass
in that bombing in Tripoli.

17:05.647 --> 17:07.480
Hey, how about you, Thorn?

17:07.481 --> 17:09.147
Or does your hairdresser here
hide all your scars for you?

17:11.314 --> 17:13.455
Uh...

17:13.457 --> 17:15.253
I've been pretty lucky so far.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.909
From what I've heard, you're kind of
always in the middle of everything.

17:18.192 --> 17:20.800
AMANI: Last summer, we
were in Karbala, right,

17:20.931 --> 17:23.056
and this car bomb took out 16 people.

17:23.166 --> 17:26.165
My head was bleeding.
My legs were torn up.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.938
I mean, people lost their shit.

17:28.939 --> 17:31.188
I'll never forget it.
There was this, um...

17:31.189 --> 17:33.480
There was this kid, he was
sitting on the street.

17:33.481 --> 17:35.522
Couldn't have been more
than 10 years old.

17:35.523 --> 17:37.272
His face was torn up,

17:37.273 --> 17:41.522
and he was stabbing himself
in the gut with a crucifix

17:41.523 --> 17:43.480
over and over again,

17:43.481 --> 17:47.021
like six times before
he finally keeled over,

17:47.022 --> 17:48.647
thing still sticking out of him.

17:48.648 --> 17:50.313
Meanwhile, this guy...

17:50.314 --> 17:52.021
Nothing.

17:52.022 --> 17:56.647
It's like weird stuff happens
all the time, but...

17:56.648 --> 17:58.480
never a scratch.

17:58.481 --> 18:02.063
My sister spent her whole life

18:02.064 --> 18:05.188
in war zones like that, and...

18:05.189 --> 18:06.356
she died in a sinkhole.

18:09.314 --> 18:10.730
Mmm.

18:10.731 --> 18:13.440
I got to get something
to eat before I...

18:20.606 --> 18:22.522
Thanks for coming.

18:22.523 --> 18:25.440
I'm sorry I missed the service.
I had some fires to put out.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.648
I need to get out of here.

18:31.690 --> 18:33.980
New York.

18:33.981 --> 18:36.230
Anything interesting coming in?

18:36.231 --> 18:38.605
An assignment?

18:38.606 --> 18:40.473
Why don't you take it
easy for a couple weeks?

18:40.505 --> 18:41.431
I'm fine.

18:44.356 --> 18:46.689
Listen, um...

18:46.690 --> 18:48.605
I've been meaning to give this to you.

18:48.606 --> 18:50.981
I've been carrying it around
for a couple of days.

18:53.148 --> 18:54.148
55 grand?

18:54.149 --> 18:56.313
For your Demascus photos.

18:56.314 --> 18:59.063
There's been a lot of
interest in your work.

18:59.064 --> 19:00.689
This says Ann Rutledge.
She bought my photo?

19:00.690 --> 19:02.564
A lot of them, actually.

19:02.565 --> 19:05.481
She's pretty much taken
out the entire library.

19:14.189 --> 19:15.480
Don't worry.

19:15.481 --> 19:17.313
Next week, I'm gonna
take him to the Caicos.

19:17.314 --> 19:20.313
A month of rum and sun is just
what this doctor ordered.

19:20.314 --> 19:22.355
And when we get back,
you can hook us up,

19:22.356 --> 19:24.480
maybe with that thing in Pakistan.

19:24.481 --> 19:26.272
We need to talk.

19:26.273 --> 19:28.356

19:34.731 --> 19:37.980
Uh, Ann Rutledge, please.
I'm returning her call.

19:37.981 --> 19:41.105
I'm sorry, sir, there's
no one here by that name.

19:41.106 --> 19:43.647
Uh, could you check again, please?

19:43.648 --> 19:45.272
She left this number.

19:45.273 --> 19:47.230
I don't need to check, sir.

19:47.231 --> 19:49.647
It's important I talk to her.

19:49.648 --> 19:51.480
The name's Damien Thorn.

19:51.481 --> 19:54.397
Oh. I'm so sorry, Mr. Thorn.

19:54.398 --> 19:57.730
I'll make sure Ms. Rutledge
gets your message immediately.

19:57.731 --> 20:00.148
Good evening, Mr. Thorn.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.273
You're firing us?

20:08.022 --> 20:10.230
Did you tell him?

20:10.231 --> 20:11.522
I couldn't.

20:11.523 --> 20:13.439
Jesus, Ceci, that's...

20:13.440 --> 20:14.980
That's nice timing.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.314
I'm sorry.

Out of all the kids who
went to our school,

20:39.981 --> 20:42.522
the Baptiste sisters
were the brightest...

20:42.523 --> 20:44.980
asking questions,

20:44.981 --> 20:46.356
pushing to know the truth.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.480
Well, I-I don't know Simone,

20:50.481 --> 20:52.063
but, uh, that sounds like Kelly.

20:52.064 --> 20:54.188
It's good that they have a foundation.

20:54.189 --> 20:55.689
Simone needs it now.

20:55.690 --> 20:57.981
Are you a man of faith?

21:00.356 --> 21:02.147
Anything but.

21:02.148 --> 21:05.105
It's times like these that
our faith can serve us well.

21:05.106 --> 21:07.480
To be honest, I was just
thinking, given how Kelly died,

21:07.481 --> 21:10.313
I wouldn't put my faith
in any foundation.

21:10.314 --> 21:14.313
Things give way, no rhyme or reason.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.605
That is God's plan.

21:16.606 --> 21:19.355
I've heard a lot about God's plan.

21:19.356 --> 21:23.188
Yeah. Coming wars,
plagues, untold suffering.

21:23.189 --> 21:27.063
Then Jesus swoops down from Heaven

21:27.064 --> 21:29.439
and we're all delivered from evil...
amen.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.355
The Book of Revelation was
written for the faithful

21:32.356 --> 21:34.230
during a time of persecution.

21:34.231 --> 21:36.021
But it's meant to inspire us,

21:36.022 --> 21:38.980
to keep us going, no
matter what we suffer.

21:38.981 --> 21:42.106
At the end, God will save us.

21:50.314 --> 21:52.605
I just don't buy it.

21:52.606 --> 21:54.313
Look around.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.439
If God did exist, then
he's timeless, right?

21:56.440 --> 21:57.647
Right.

21:57.648 --> 22:00.272
So what's he waiting for?

22:00.273 --> 22:03.188
Why doesn't he save us now?
Why didn't he save Kelly?

22:03.189 --> 22:04.439
I mean, she was reporting

22:04.440 --> 22:05.730
on attrocities all around the world.

22:05.731 --> 22:07.480
Forced starvation, slavery,

22:07.481 --> 22:09.480
rape being used as a political weapon.

22:09.481 --> 22:11.605
She was helping those
working against suffering,

22:11.606 --> 22:13.355
and God kills her in a parking lot.

22:13.356 --> 22:14.980
It's unacceptable.

22:14.981 --> 22:16.480
I mean, he should do better.

22:16.481 --> 22:18.147
I'm supposed to accept

22:18.148 --> 22:19.689
some mythological ideology
from 2,000 years ago

22:19.690 --> 22:21.272
that it's all meant to mean something,

22:21.273 --> 22:22.647
it's all part of some divine plan.

22:22.648 --> 22:24.980
I'm sorry, Father,
that's not good enough.

22:24.981 --> 22:26.522
It's a cruel joke.

22:26.523 --> 22:29.314
If God's the one telling it,
then he's a sadistic prick!

22:34.149 --> 22:36.273
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

32:26.912 --> 32:28.411
But I'm sure I'll have
more questions tomorrow.

32:28.412 --> 32:29.702
Absolutely.

32:29.703 --> 32:31.911
You're free to go.

32:31.912 --> 32:33.828
Thank you.

32:46.120 --> 32:48.453
[Indistinct shouting]

32:48.454 --> 32:50.536
Damien, I love you.

32:50.537 --> 32:53.161
- [Video stops]
- But she's Syrian.

32:54.121 --> 32:56.494
How does she know him?
She sounds American.

32:56.495 --> 32:58.869
He's been freaked out
ever since that riot.

32:58.870 --> 33:01.036
It's all for you.

33:01.037 --> 33:04.120
What does she mean it's all for him?

33:07.120 --> 33:08.911
[Keys jingling]

33:08.912 --> 33:11.537
No, I'm fine, really. Thank you.

33:14.703 --> 33:17.412
[Door closes]

33:19.662 --> 33:22.952
Not exactly the safest neighborhood.

33:22.953 --> 33:25.411
We own some corporate apartments

33:25.412 --> 33:27.911
for visiting guests, things like that.

33:27.912 --> 33:29.620
Let me put you up in one.

33:29.621 --> 33:31.578
That's not necessary.

33:31.579 --> 33:35.411
It's just some, uh,
psycho on the street.

33:35.412 --> 33:36.537
It's over.

33:39.870 --> 33:41.411
You said he had a knife.

33:41.412 --> 33:43.078
Did you see what it looked like?

33:44.828 --> 33:47.620
Kind of crude, like an artifact.

33:47.621 --> 33:50.620
Any figures carved on the handle?

33:50.621 --> 33:52.411
It was coming at me kind of fast.

33:52.412 --> 33:54.661
You'll forgive me for not
admiring the craftsmanship.

33:54.662 --> 33:56.744
Why would you ask?

33:56.745 --> 33:58.869
How did you even know something
was happening in the first place?

33:58.870 --> 34:01.411
Because I've been watching you.

34:01.412 --> 34:03.037
What do you mean?

34:04.828 --> 34:08.536
I know you've just met
me, but the truth is

34:08.536 --> 34:10.536
you're very important to me, Damien.

34:10.536 --> 34:14.119
You have been for a long time.

34:14.120 --> 34:18.702
I wasn't at the funeral today
because I knew that girl.

34:18.703 --> 34:20.454
I was there for you.

34:21.911 --> 34:25.369
The other day when we met,
that was planned, too?

34:27.411 --> 34:29.578
Why? What do you want?

34:29.579 --> 34:32.411
You'll have all the answers
in time, I promise.

34:32.411 --> 34:34.744
No, I'll have the answers now.
Did you even know my father?

34:34.745 --> 34:37.661
Yes, I met him in London.

34:37.661 --> 34:39.661
I was working in the
economic policy unit

34:39.661 --> 34:41.827
at the American embassy
when he was ambassador.

34:41.828 --> 34:43.077
And?

34:43.078 --> 34:47.661
We worked very closely together.

34:48.713 --> 34:50.920
You had an affair.

34:51.643 --> 34:53.933
[Chuckling] Oh, God, no.

34:53.934 --> 34:56.266
He adored your mother.

34:56.266 --> 34:58.891
I barely remember her.

34:58.892 --> 35:01.308
It was such a shame she
had to die so young.

35:01.309 --> 35:03.974
It absolutely devastated your father.

35:03.975 --> 35:07.683
And then to have his own
tragedy immediately after.

35:07.684 --> 35:10.850
We were so concerned.

35:10.851 --> 35:12.933
We all rallied around you.

35:12.934 --> 35:14.600
Who? Rallied how?

35:14.601 --> 35:16.725
So much pain so young.

35:16.726 --> 35:18.100
I always wondered

35:18.101 --> 35:21.183
if you were able to do it because...

35:21.184 --> 35:24.683
Because...?

35:24.684 --> 35:27.725
They weren't your real parents.

35:27.726 --> 35:30.059
You were adopted.

35:32.101 --> 35:33.850
That's not true.

35:33.851 --> 35:35.767
Yes, it is.

35:35.768 --> 35:38.725
In Rome. The night you were born.

35:38.726 --> 35:40.809
Your real mother died.

35:40.810 --> 35:42.809
Katherine gave birth that same night,

35:42.810 --> 35:44.266
but her baby died, too.

35:44.267 --> 35:47.725
A priest approached your
father and convinced him to...

35:47.726 --> 35:49.100
to take you in.

35:49.101 --> 35:51.850
She never knew the truth.

35:51.851 --> 35:52.934
How do you know this?

35:55.184 --> 35:57.101
I know it's a lot to take in.

35:59.142 --> 36:00.850
But it's time you finally know

36:00.851 --> 36:03.142
the true circumstances of your birth...

36:04.226 --> 36:07.226
Who you are.

36:12.768 --> 36:16.016
I'll tell you everything
you want to know...

36:16.017 --> 36:18.600
who that man was who
tried to kill you...

36:18.601 --> 36:21.266
why your parents died...

36:21.267 --> 36:23.642
why there's so much death around you...

36:23.643 --> 36:25.933
why you couldn't save Kelly.

36:25.934 --> 36:28.058
You want answers?

36:28.059 --> 36:31.100
Come with me.

36:41.729 --> 36:44.519
[Police radio chatter]

36:45.354 --> 36:46.687
How we doing on his I.D.?

36:46.688 --> 36:48.687
No wallet, but we ran his cellphone.

36:48.688 --> 36:50.770
Hermon Soroyan, 24,

36:50.771 --> 36:53.395
graduate student upstate,
religious studies, no priors.

36:53.396 --> 36:55.520
Any chance it wasn't an accident?

36:55.521 --> 36:57.313
Not sure how it could be anything else.

36:58.730 --> 37:00.894
It's too weird. It doesn't add up.

37:00.895 --> 37:02.395
Before you head off,

37:02.396 --> 37:03.437
let me get another
look at those tattoos.

37:03.438 --> 37:05.353
Detective needs to see.

37:05.354 --> 37:06.687
Check this out.

37:06.688 --> 37:08.770
He's got identical
tattoos on his forearms.

37:08.771 --> 37:10.520
"P.X."

37:10.521 --> 37:12.894
Some kind of gang markings?

37:12.895 --> 37:15.395
It's a Christogram.

37:15.396 --> 37:16.521
I Googled it.

37:19.313 --> 37:21.894
Is he part of some kind
of cult or something?

37:21.895 --> 37:24.187
Not anymore.

37:33.563 --> 37:36.354
I'm sure you could use a drink.

38:03.730 --> 38:06.520
Why are you collecting my work?

38:06.521 --> 38:10.187
I like photographs that
make us uncomfortable.

38:12.854 --> 38:15.729
It's a bit...

38:15.730 --> 38:18.395
obsessive.

38:18.396 --> 38:20.186
[Scoffs]

38:20.187 --> 38:22.187
You're not the world's only
photographer, you know.

38:23.479 --> 38:25.187
You're in good company.

38:28.187 --> 38:30.729
This is one of my favorites.

38:30.730 --> 38:35.395
The day after the storm.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.478
I was just starting out.

38:37.479 --> 38:39.853
Mm. Made quite an impression.

38:39.854 --> 38:42.521
That's putting it mildly.

38:44.688 --> 38:47.687
No one really wants to
look in the mirror.

38:47.688 --> 38:50.687
Facing the harsh truths of this world

38:50.688 --> 38:53.478
isn't for the weak.

38:53.479 --> 38:56.354
Why am I here?

38:58.354 --> 38:59.854
I'm worried about you.

39:02.812 --> 39:05.313
The man that tried to kill you...

39:07.396 --> 39:09.854
He had one of these, didn't he?

39:22.812 --> 39:24.854
Please, Daddy, no!

39:41.354 --> 39:43.812
[Shudders]

40:02.271 --> 40:04.521
Come with me.

41:03.854 --> 41:06.228
- Aah!
- Mom!

41:06.229 --> 41:08.146
[Screams]

41:22.521 --> 41:24.729
WOMAN: Have no fear, little one.

41:24.730 --> 41:27.313
I'll be here to protect thee.

41:33.865 --> 41:35.304
Welcome home, Damien.
