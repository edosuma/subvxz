00:08.921 --> 00:11.098
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:11.098 --> 00:12.403
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:12.403 --> 00:14.797
<i>by two separate,
yet equally important groups:</i>

00:14.797 --> 00:16.755
<i>the police,
who investigate crime,</i>

00:16.755 --> 00:19.715
<i>and the district attorneys,
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:19.715 --> 00:21.760
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:25.851 --> 00:27.549
<i>Hi, this is Jenny.
Leave a message.</i>

00:27.549 --> 00:28.811
Hi, Mom.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.031
Sorry I haven't been
in touch for a while.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.946
Things have been a little crazy
lately with classes

00:33.946 --> 00:36.514
and work at the coffee shop.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.168
I miss you.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.691
Let's get together soon.

00:39.691 --> 00:43.391
Maybe dinner at the Jupiter
or something?

00:43.391 --> 00:45.088
I love you.

00:45.088 --> 00:47.177
Okay. I gotta go.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.961
Tell Dad I love him too.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.267
Bye.

00:54.271 --> 00:56.665
I'm really not feeling well.

01:01.844 --> 01:04.064
Restaurant worker
found her in the dumpster.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.456
Body's been rolled up
in that rug.

01:05.456 --> 01:06.414
Any ID?

01:06.414 --> 01:08.720
No wallet.
No phone, either.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.331
Approximate age?

01:10.331 --> 01:13.551
17 or 18.
Your guess is as good as mine.

01:13.551 --> 01:14.813
Time of death?

01:14.813 --> 01:16.902
MLI said she's been dead
at least a day.

01:16.902 --> 01:18.730
Probably been here a few hours.

01:18.730 --> 01:19.949
Cause of death?

01:19.949 --> 01:22.038
No obvious signs of trauma.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.219
What is that?

01:29.219 --> 01:31.569
Looks like a brand.

01:31.569 --> 01:32.788
Lone star?

01:32.788 --> 01:33.919
What is that, Texas?

01:33.919 --> 01:36.531
No, no, no. Lodestar.

01:36.531 --> 01:41.405
Means inspiration or a guiding
light for a ship at night.

01:41.405 --> 01:43.146
What the hell
guided her here?

02:30.846 --> 02:31.977
Young lady at the end.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.240
What did she die of?

02:33.240 --> 02:34.502
She died of septic shock.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.460
The wound from the branding
got infected.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.593
It was festering
for a couple of weeks.

02:38.593 --> 02:41.509
And she never got
any medical treatment.

02:41.509 --> 02:44.207
Probably because of this.

02:44.207 --> 02:45.600
- Ligature marks.
- Mm-hmm.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.210
So she was being held
against her will.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.951
Meanwhile,
the infection spread.

02:48.951 --> 02:52.084
Sepsis caused tissue damage
and ultimately, organ failure.

02:52.084 --> 02:54.391
Any estimate on her age?

02:54.391 --> 02:57.699
The forensic odontologist
put her in her early 20s.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.180
She seemed a hell
of a lot younger than that.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.312
Malnutrition will do that.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.184
She probably comes from money.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.577
Has expensive dental work.

03:06.577 --> 03:09.493
So nobody in Missing Persons
matches her description.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.060
Facial rec was a bust.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.497
And the branding design
didn't turn up in any database.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.978
- You run her prints?
- Not in the system.

03:15.978 --> 03:20.417
Only thing I found
was this in her pocket.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.421
It's got a logo
to a music store.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.554
Sharp Sounds Music.

03:30.819 --> 03:33.430
That's Ava.
What the hell happened to her?

03:33.430 --> 03:34.605
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.694
She died of an infection.

03:36.694 --> 03:39.262
- An infection?
- Was she in here recently?

03:39.262 --> 03:40.698
It's been a couple months.

03:40.698 --> 03:43.527
She was super sweet
and really nice.

03:43.527 --> 03:44.963
We're trying to identify her.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.356
Maybe you know her last name?

03:46.356 --> 03:47.879
I'm sorry.

03:47.879 --> 03:49.707
What about a receipt?
Maybe she bought something.

03:49.707 --> 03:52.319
No, I gave her
a couple guitar picks.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.712
I gave her a harmonica too.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.410
I kind of felt sorry for her.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.802
Why is that?

03:57.802 --> 03:59.891
She seemed lost.

03:59.891 --> 04:02.024
She used to stop by the store
every now and then,

04:02.024 --> 04:04.287
you know, ask to play
some of the guitars.

04:04.287 --> 04:05.549
I loved listening to her.

04:05.549 --> 04:06.724
You know,
she was really talented.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.552
She ever come in here
with anybody?

04:08.552 --> 04:09.901
Uh, yeah, a dude.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.903
Oh, yeah?
What'd he look like?

04:11.903 --> 04:14.079
Early 20s, dreadlocks.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.864
Don't suppose you know
where we can find him.

04:15.864 --> 04:18.258
Yeah, sometimes he busks
at that park

04:18.258 --> 04:19.389
a couple blocks south of here.

04:19.389 --> 04:21.478
Name's Ken something.

04:21.478 --> 04:24.481
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

04:27.049 --> 04:28.093
Excuse me.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.356
Excuse me, Ken.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.574
Ken, we need a word.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.010
It's primetime
right now, man.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.098
Can this wait?

04:33.098 --> 04:34.665
Unfortunately, it can't.

04:36.972 --> 04:39.757
Ava and I met senior year
at Tufts.

04:39.757 --> 04:42.064
We both wanted to be musicians.

04:42.064 --> 04:45.459
We moved in together
right after graduation.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.330
A few months ago,
she started hanging out

04:47.330 --> 04:49.680
with a new group of friends,

04:49.680 --> 04:53.336
said she was looking
to deepen her creative forces.

04:53.336 --> 04:55.860
Kicked me to the curb.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.253
That make you mad?

04:57.253 --> 04:59.908
Bummed me out,
but I didn't kill her.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.779
I loved her.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.303
We wanna get in touch
with her parents.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.304
You know her last name?

05:04.304 --> 05:05.566
Newhall.

05:05.566 --> 05:08.264
They live
on the Upper East Side.

05:08.264 --> 05:10.048
When was the last time
you saw her?

05:10.048 --> 05:11.702
We were supposed
to meet up at a bar

05:11.702 --> 05:13.835
in Red Hook five days ago.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.403
I wanted to apologize
for some things.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.753
She stood you up?

05:18.753 --> 05:21.451
Someone said they saw her
outside the bar running away.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.497
I went to go check,
but she wasn't there,

05:23.497 --> 05:26.151
so I figured she changed
her mind about meeting me.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.588
We need the name of the bar.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.463
Sorry, guys.
We're not open yet.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.247
Come back in an hour.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.466
NYPD.

05:36.466 --> 05:37.641
You the manager?

05:37.641 --> 05:39.382
I'm the owner.
How can I help?

05:39.382 --> 05:41.471
You seen this girl
around here before?

05:41.471 --> 05:43.038
Doesn't look familiar.

05:44.953 --> 05:47.608
- What about this guy?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.261
He comes in from time to time.

05:49.261 --> 05:50.306
Did he do something?

05:50.306 --> 05:51.655
We're not sure.

05:51.655 --> 05:55.006
How long these cameras
store video?

05:55.006 --> 05:57.182
About a week.

05:57.182 --> 05:59.359
Love to see the footage.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.969
Sure.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.494
Hey.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.409
I tracked down
the vic's parents.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.846
Father is
a Wall Street big shot.

06:08.846 --> 06:11.501
The mother is
a network news anchor.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.068
Uh, Jenny Newhall?

06:13.068 --> 06:14.635
Oh, my wife loves her.

06:14.635 --> 06:15.810
Well, they're in Palm Beach,

06:15.810 --> 06:18.029
but they're headed back
to New York now.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.335
Hey.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.511
How are we doing
with that video from the bar?

06:21.511 --> 06:23.034
Going through it now.

06:23.034 --> 06:26.473
Ava's ex-boyfriend
was definitely there.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.997
- Yeah, does she ever show?
- Not exactly.

06:28.997 --> 06:33.610
This is about a block
from the bar.

06:37.048 --> 06:40.530
There's Ava.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.445
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:42.445 --> 06:43.620
That's attempted kidnapping.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.187
Who the hell is this guy?

06:48.930 --> 06:50.845
Geez.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.760
All right, find out
who that guy was.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.239
I'll run the plates.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.946
There's our car.

07:11.474 --> 07:12.954
Donnie Preston.

07:14.477 --> 07:15.870
NYPD.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.481
What are you doing?
This is my car, my house.

07:18.481 --> 07:19.526
Is there a problem?

07:19.526 --> 07:21.092
Gun!

07:21.092 --> 07:22.442
Hands above your head.

07:24.139 --> 07:25.488
Touch the fence.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.449
Keep your hands on the fence.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.624
Do not move.

07:32.408 --> 07:33.801
I didn't do nothing.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.367
Yeah, well,
you got a lot of firepower

07:35.367 --> 07:36.281
for a guy
who didn't do nothing.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.326
They're legal.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.936
What's this all about?

07:38.936 --> 07:41.591
Attempted kidnapping,
for starters.

07:51.035 --> 07:52.907
It's not what you think.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.343
I wasn't gonna hurt her.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.693
No, you were just gonna
drive her around the city,

07:56.693 --> 07:59.261
maybe grab a cocktail
at the Polo Lounge,

07:59.261 --> 08:01.742
and then drop her off
safe and sound at home, right?

08:01.742 --> 08:03.874
Look, I know Ava's parents.

08:03.874 --> 08:06.442
I'm the doorman
in their building.

08:06.442 --> 08:09.053
Her mother hired me,
paid me 20 grand,

08:09.053 --> 08:11.099
half upfront and the other half
upon delivery.

08:11.099 --> 08:12.492
What do you mean delivery?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.276
I was supposed
to bring the kid home.

08:14.276 --> 08:15.582
Come on, bro.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.453
You're trying
to make us believe

08:17.453 --> 08:20.195
that Ava's parents hired you
to kidnap her?

08:20.195 --> 08:22.023
No. I was trying to save her.

08:22.023 --> 08:24.591
- From what?
- I don't know. I didn't ask.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.593
I got bills to pay
just like everyone else.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.551
Yeah.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.902
Ava's parents are here.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.384
Sit tight.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.214
She sent us
a strange voicemail

08:39.214 --> 08:40.607
a couple of days ago.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.217
We tried calling,
but she never picked up.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.480
This is exactly
what we were trying to prevent.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.786
It's why we hired Donnie.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.396
Was your daughter
in some kind of trouble?

08:47.396 --> 08:48.658
Yes, she was.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.530
She'd apparently joined
some sort of cult.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.097
She went to a meeting,
a group dedicated

08:53.097 --> 08:58.581
to unlocking their creativity
or something like that.

08:58.581 --> 09:01.628
Ava had been depressed, uninspired.

09:01.628 --> 09:04.021
Anyway, she seemed
really excited about it,

09:04.021 --> 09:06.589
so we were supportive.
- At first.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.591
But then it started to spiral.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.158
Was she living
with anyone at this cult?

09:10.158 --> 09:11.681
I think so.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.596
She pretty much cut off
all contact with us.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.642
Except when she wanted money.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.818
These people
tried to bleed her dry.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.733
They emptied her bank accounts
and then started

09:19.733 --> 09:21.691
taking from her trust fund.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.563
Thank God my lawyer called me.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.999
We put a freeze on the account.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.174
So you cut her off?

09:26.174 --> 09:27.436
I had to.

09:27.436 --> 09:28.829
How did she take that?

09:28.829 --> 09:31.135
She just kept
repeating this mantra.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.398
"I'm not a victim.
Lodestar is my guide.

09:33.398 --> 09:35.705
I will manifest my future."

09:35.705 --> 09:38.099
It's like she wasn't
herself anymore.

09:38.099 --> 09:40.928
We just--we couldn't
connect with her, the--

09:40.928 --> 09:42.277
the real her.

09:42.277 --> 09:46.194
So you hired your doorman
to bring her home?

09:46.194 --> 09:48.762
I assume that means you
know where she was living.

09:53.636 --> 09:57.205
Sisters, these detectives
just told me we lost Ava.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.903
Oh, no.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.036
I don't understand
what happened.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.691
Ava was on a righteous path.
She was a warrior.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.127
I'm sure she was,
but unfortunately,

10:06.127 --> 10:07.868
that's not how we found her.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.740
When was the last time
any of you saw Ava?

10:12.699 --> 10:14.396
I haven't seen her
in a few days.

10:14.396 --> 10:15.702
Me, either.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.138
I went to her room
this morning.

10:17.138 --> 10:18.574
I was gonna give her
a cup of mint tea,

10:18.574 --> 10:20.184
but she wasn't there.

10:20.184 --> 10:22.099
I saw her two nights ago.

10:22.099 --> 10:24.406
I think she was going
to watch some bands.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.713
She didn't look like she was
going out to listen to music.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.279
She was still in her pajamas.

10:28.279 --> 10:29.498
She wasn't even wearing shoes.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.459
What exactly goes on
in this house?

10:34.459 --> 10:36.940
We're just
a community of women

10:36.940 --> 10:39.682
dedicated to creativity
and self-actualization.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.684
Oh. Who's in charge?

10:41.684 --> 10:44.034
We're all in charge,

10:44.034 --> 10:46.515
yet at the same time,
we're all subordinate.

10:49.387 --> 10:50.606
So let me get this straight.

10:50.606 --> 10:53.609
Ava died from an infection

10:53.609 --> 10:57.395
that was spreading for days,
maybe even weeks.

10:57.395 --> 11:01.182
She was rolled up in a carpet
and tossed into a dumpster.

11:01.182 --> 11:05.447
Nobody here noticed anything
out of the ordinary.

11:10.104 --> 11:14.499
And no one can tell me
what happened to her.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.327
You look familiar to me.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.633
How do I know you?

11:17.633 --> 11:19.330
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.506
Why don't you grab your
coat and step outside?

11:21.506 --> 11:22.551
Let's go.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.734
Sorry for your loss.

11:37.653 --> 11:38.785
You really found Ava
in the dumpster?

11:38.785 --> 11:41.004
- What's your name?
- Sienna Barton.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.397
I recognized
that hand signal.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.659
You were asking
for help, right?

11:43.659 --> 11:45.313
I have a daughter
about your age.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.749
She learned it on social media.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.446
- I need to talk to my parents.
- Sure.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.013
I'll get you a phone.
Come here.

11:52.015 --> 11:54.104
Hold on. You're safe with us.

11:54.104 --> 11:55.410
No one's gonna hurt you.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.804
It's okay. It's okay.
Just take a breath.

12:00.023 --> 12:03.157
You know your friend Ava
was sick, right?

12:03.157 --> 12:06.247
She had a brand
that got infected.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.857
You know anything about that?

12:12.993 --> 12:14.342
I don't wanna
talk about all this.

12:14.342 --> 12:15.909
I need to call my parents.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.606
Then why don't we
call them from the car?

12:17.606 --> 12:19.782
It's probably safer.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.479
Is that okay?

12:37.234 --> 12:39.410
Ava and I worked in
the same coffee shop.

12:39.410 --> 12:40.716
She said she was
feeling kind of stuck,

12:40.716 --> 12:41.673
so I told her about
this group, Lodestar.

12:41.673 --> 12:42.979
I thought we could help.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.807
Was she being held
against her will?

12:44.807 --> 12:47.810
No.
We were all there voluntarily.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.857
Can you explain
the ligature marks?

12:50.857 --> 12:52.380
On her wrists,
she had these marks.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.338
It looked like
she was being restrained.

12:54.338 --> 12:57.341
That's from the
branding ceremony.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.648
It kind of hurts,
so we tie everyone down.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.043
When was she branded?

13:03.043 --> 13:04.653
A couple of weeks ago.

13:04.653 --> 13:07.264
That wound got infected.
That's what killed her.

13:07.264 --> 13:10.702
Did you--did you notice
her health was deteriorating?

13:10.702 --> 13:12.835
She seemed okay,
but I didn't really

13:12.835 --> 13:14.228
see her much
in the past few days.

13:14.228 --> 13:18.362
Did somebody prevent her
from seeing a doctor?

13:18.362 --> 13:20.800
Not exactly.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.063
I'm sorry,
but it's complicated.

13:23.063 --> 13:27.937
You can tell us
what you're afraid of.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.330
I'm not a victim.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.420
Lodestar is my guide.
I will manifest my future.

13:34.552 --> 13:38.513
We respect that,
but a woman has died.

13:38.513 --> 13:41.733
You know that you participated
in an assault?

13:41.733 --> 13:43.779
Sienna, sweetheart.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.567
This is my daughter.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.569
I wanna talk to her alone.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.012
I think we should charge her.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.143
With what?

14:00.143 --> 14:02.711
Assault, conspiracy, manslaughter.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.756
She admitted she
participated in the branding.

14:04.756 --> 14:07.455
No, I get it, but I just--

14:07.455 --> 14:09.239
I don't think that's enough.

14:09.239 --> 14:10.719
We charge manslaughter
when kids

14:10.719 --> 14:12.547
drink themselves to death
at fraternity hazings.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.070
Yeah, but that's not
what happened here.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.245
There's a time gap.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.464
She had enough time
to go to a doctor.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.031
Maybe somebody
didn't let her

14:18.031 --> 14:19.684
because going
to get medical treatment

14:19.684 --> 14:22.383
would have drawn attention
to the cult.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.864
Okay. Fair enough.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.215
So if you can find evidence
that the person

14:28.215 --> 14:31.392
who branded Ava also prevented
her from going to the doctor

14:31.392 --> 14:34.090
and then dumped her body,

14:34.090 --> 14:36.701
we can charge that person
with homicide.

14:42.229 --> 14:43.578
Police. Open up.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.798
Police.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.452
We're executing
a search warrant.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.585
We need to enter the premises.

14:50.585 --> 14:51.934
Step back, miss.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.196
Please step back.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.854
Move into that room, please.
- Come on.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.812
- Ladies, let's go.
- Hey, let's go. Come on.

15:00.812 --> 15:02.075
I need everyone to stop
what they're doing

15:02.075 --> 15:04.425
and move over to this room.
Come on.

15:04.425 --> 15:07.645
Move along. Have a seat.

15:07.645 --> 15:10.170
Keep an eye on them.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.867
Where's Ava's room?

15:11.867 --> 15:14.043
It's over there
at the end of the hall.

15:14.043 --> 15:16.437
- Whose room is that?
- That's my room.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.091
Please have a seat.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.101
I was just in Ava's bedroom.

15:28.101 --> 15:30.799
Couldn't find a cell phone,
but I found a brand new carpet

15:30.799 --> 15:32.583
with the price tag still on it.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.846
I got a receipt
for an 8 by 10 foot carpet,

15:34.846 --> 15:36.109
purchased this morning.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.241
Paid for by Jocelyn Davis.
- Get out of here.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.590
So she replaced the carpet,

15:39.590 --> 15:41.114
which shows consciousness
of guilt.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.812
Means we can prove Ava
was killed in her bedroom.

15:43.812 --> 15:47.207
Also means we can prove
Jocelyn lied to us.

15:47.207 --> 15:50.514
She said that Ava
went to go see a band

15:50.514 --> 15:52.038
and never came home.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.259
There she is.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.087
I got the branding iron.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.179
Well, that's three strikes
against Jocelyn.

16:03.179 --> 16:06.095
Jocelyn, could you
come over here, please?

16:06.095 --> 16:07.183
We need a word.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.275
You can't take control
over me.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.885
You can't break the circle.

16:13.885 --> 16:16.105
These bonds,
they're shatterproof.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.107
You don't wanna interfere
in an arrest.

16:18.107 --> 16:19.761
We stand united.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.284
Yeah, that's not
how this works.

16:21.284 --> 16:22.720
So you back off now,

16:22.720 --> 16:25.810
or we're gonna do
our own division.

16:25.810 --> 16:29.031
Frank, let's try
a different approach.

16:29.031 --> 16:33.209
Jocelyn, you seem
like a smart woman.

16:33.209 --> 16:34.732
Come with us.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.739
Okay, all of you
listen to me closely.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.741
We can do this the easy way,

16:43.741 --> 16:45.395
or we can do this
my partner's way.

16:45.395 --> 16:46.788
Up to you.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.448
It's okay.

16:54.448 --> 16:55.971
We haven't done anything wrong.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.496
Put your hands
behind your back.

16:59.496 --> 17:02.760
You're under arrest
for the death of Ava Newhall.

17:06.851 --> 17:11.073
This is a branding iron
we found in your bedroom.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.206
Your fingerprints were
lifted from the handle.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.947
Ava's DNA was found
on the Lodestar stamp.

17:15.947 --> 17:18.037
Ava consented
to the branding.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.735
We both know
consent is not a defense

17:20.735 --> 17:23.085
to the infliction
of serious bodily injury.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.565
And we found this carpet
in the dumpster.

17:24.565 --> 17:28.917
It was used to hide
and transport Ava's dead body.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.962
Crime lab technicians
recovered a few strands

17:30.962 --> 17:32.355
of hair in the fibers.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.270
Matches your client's DNA--

17:34.270 --> 17:37.099
strong evidence that she's the
one who disposed of the body.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.927
Why did you throw her
into a dumpster?

17:38.927 --> 17:40.668
Why didn't you
call her parents?

17:40.668 --> 17:42.191
Why didn't you call 911?

17:42.191 --> 17:43.932
Don't answer that.

17:43.932 --> 17:47.109
From where I sit, you didn't
want her to get any help.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.242
You didn't want the doctors
to see her branding.

17:49.242 --> 17:52.984
You knew that would
expose you and your cult.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.334
Who helped you
carry the body?

17:54.334 --> 17:56.031
'Cause there was no way
that you lugged her body

17:56.031 --> 17:57.424
out of the loft by yourself.

17:57.424 --> 18:00.470
Ava Newhall got sick
from the branding.

18:00.470 --> 18:02.385
We don't deny that.

18:02.385 --> 18:05.301
But she was awake and alert

18:05.301 --> 18:08.130
and able to move
and make her own decisions.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.306
She could have called
the doctor or her parents.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.308
Tough to do when
you're tied down.

18:12.308 --> 18:13.962
This is absurd.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.573
There is no causal connection
between my client's

18:16.573 --> 18:18.532
alleged actions
and Ava's death.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.229
Come on.
We're getting out of here.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.624
May I?

18:23.624 --> 18:25.669
Charge her.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.149
Charge her with what?

18:32.633 --> 18:35.157
The defendant is charged
with aggravated assault

18:35.157 --> 18:37.072
and illegal disposal
of a corpse.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.726
Are the People seeking bail?

18:38.726 --> 18:40.249
We're seeking 1 million cash.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.511
$1 million?

18:41.511 --> 18:44.514
At most she's facing
a few years probation.

18:44.514 --> 18:45.994
Point taken.

18:45.994 --> 18:48.039
Why should I impose bail,
Ms. Maroun?

18:48.039 --> 18:50.172
The defendant branded
another woman

18:50.172 --> 18:53.349
as part of an initiation
into a cult.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.569
The wound got infected
and Ava Newhall died.

18:55.569 --> 18:59.094
Then the defendant dumped
her dead body in the trash.

18:59.094 --> 19:01.705
Your Honor, my client
has no criminal record.

19:01.705 --> 19:02.880
She is not a flight risk.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.665
The people are simply
punishing her

19:04.665 --> 19:06.536
for her
unconventional lifestyle.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.190
These are trumped up charges
that will go nowhere.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.844
We're asking for personal.

19:09.844 --> 19:13.108
The defendant is currently
under investigation for murder.

19:13.108 --> 19:15.371
If the people
wanna charge murder,

19:15.371 --> 19:17.243
come back
and I'll reconsider the bail.

19:17.243 --> 19:20.420
Until then, I'm releasing her
on her own recognizance.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.555
Can I go? Am I free?

19:25.555 --> 19:27.035
Yes.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.428
Next case.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.129
What the hell
happened in there?

19:34.129 --> 19:35.435
It's only the arraignment.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.088
We thought the judge
would hold her.

19:37.088 --> 19:39.090
Bail is only to assure
that she'll return.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.918
I don't need a lecture
from you on bail.

19:40.918 --> 19:42.224
I know how the system works.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.574
The woman
who killed my daughter,

19:44.574 --> 19:47.534
rolled her body up in a carpet,
and tossed her in a dumpster

19:47.534 --> 19:49.666
gets to go home
to her comfortable loft

19:49.666 --> 19:53.540
while our daughter lies in a
coffin in Woodland Cemetery.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.460
No. No! Stop. It's okay.

20:08.946 --> 20:13.168
Well, Jocelyn Davis just
waltzed out of the courtroom.

20:13.168 --> 20:16.258
She's probably out buying a
new branding iron as we speak.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.868
Don't you have her
on a couple of felonies?

20:17.868 --> 20:19.392
Mm-hmm.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.524
So chances are she'll
end up serving a year or two.

20:21.524 --> 20:24.048
That's not enough.
Not even close.

20:24.048 --> 20:26.703
Do you have any evidence
to suggest that Jocelyn Davis

20:26.703 --> 20:28.618
is responsible for the death
of this young woman?

20:28.618 --> 20:30.707
No, but that doesn't mean
she's not responsible.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.147
She's a cult leader, Nolan.

20:36.147 --> 20:39.542
She recruits young,
vulnerable women

20:39.542 --> 20:41.631
fresh out of college
just trying to figure out

20:41.631 --> 20:43.590
what to do with their lives,
then--

20:43.590 --> 20:45.896
then she preys on them,
controls them,

20:45.896 --> 20:48.551
manipulates them,
steals their money.

20:48.551 --> 20:50.988
She's the reason
a 22-year-old woman is dead.

20:50.988 --> 20:53.382
Fair enough,
but you're just saying things.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.862
There's no real evidence
to support this.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.167
No. I know.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.908
If you want me
to prosecute it as a homicide,

20:57.908 --> 20:59.997
you need something concrete,
something that shows

20:59.997 --> 21:01.564
that Jocelyn prevented Ava

21:01.564 --> 21:03.305
from getting treatment
for her wounds.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.307
I tried, but none
of the women in the cult

21:05.307 --> 21:07.701
are willing to cooperate.

21:07.701 --> 21:11.313
Well, then work
with Forensics.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.924
See if you can find texts
or voicemails

21:13.924 --> 21:17.363
that show that Jocelyn
exercised control over Ava,

21:17.363 --> 21:19.669
something that prevented her
from seeking medical attention.

21:23.151 --> 21:25.414
I've done a deep dive
into Jocelyn's devices.

21:25.414 --> 21:28.461
She didn't send any texts
or voicemails to Ava,

21:28.461 --> 21:32.203
but I did find
some disturbing videos.

21:32.203 --> 21:34.205
This is Sienna Barton's.

21:34.205 --> 21:38.166
<i>Last year, I volunteered
at an emergency shelter</i>

21:38.166 --> 21:40.951
<i>for abused women and children.</i>

21:46.783 --> 21:50.309
<i>I stole money from one
of the women who lived there.</i>

21:50.309 --> 21:54.313
<i>$1,000, probably all the money
that she had in the world.</i>

21:54.313 --> 21:56.053
<i>When she realized
the money was missing,</i>

21:56.053 --> 21:58.665
<i>I blamed somebody else,
and that person got fired,</i>

21:58.665 --> 22:01.450
<i>and she was arrested.</i>

22:01.450 --> 22:03.452
<i>But I'm not a victim.</i>

22:03.452 --> 22:04.627
<i>I own what I did.</i>

22:04.627 --> 22:09.676
<i>Still, if my family...</i>

22:09.676 --> 22:11.939
Or my friends find out...

22:14.420 --> 22:16.073
<i>I'd want to kill myself.</i>

22:16.073 --> 22:17.684
<i>I am so ashamed.</i>

22:20.991 --> 22:23.646
<i>I share this confession
as an expression of trust</i>

22:23.646 --> 22:26.170
<i>for my entry into Lodestar.</i>

22:33.090 --> 22:35.832
That's why she didn't
wanna cooperate.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.356
She was afraid
of being exposed.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.489
Looks that way.

22:40.489 --> 22:43.187
What about Ava?
She make any confessions?

22:43.187 --> 22:45.668
Yeah. Check it out.

22:45.668 --> 22:47.453
<i>My mom is kind of famous.</i>

22:47.453 --> 22:50.499
<i>She's the anchor
on "Evening in America."</i>

22:50.499 --> 22:53.676
<i>She's--she's having an affair</i>

22:53.676 --> 22:56.984
<i>with one of the
political correspondents.</i>

22:56.984 --> 22:59.160
<i>If my dad knew,
he'd be heartbroken,</i>

22:59.160 --> 23:02.206
<i>and she'd lose her job
for sure.</i>

23:02.206 --> 23:05.079
<i>But I trust you
with this confession.</i>

23:05.079 --> 23:06.385
<i>I am not a victim.</i>

23:06.385 --> 23:09.953
<i>I am on a path
to creative enlightenment.</i>

23:09.953 --> 23:12.652
<i>I am sharing this confession
as an expression of trust</i>

23:12.652 --> 23:14.393
<i>for my entry into Lodestar.</i>

23:19.093 --> 23:21.878
The video confessions show
that Jocelyn had the power

23:21.878 --> 23:24.054
to exert tremendous pressure
over these women

23:24.054 --> 23:26.013
to get them to do
whatever she wanted.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.449
That's good news.

23:27.449 --> 23:28.842
Once they gave over
their confessions,

23:28.842 --> 23:30.409
the women couldn't walk away.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.715
They'd live in fear that their
secrets would be revealed.

23:32.715 --> 23:34.238
Took away their free will.

23:34.238 --> 23:37.720
And it explains why Ava
didn't seek medical treatment

23:37.720 --> 23:39.722
for her infection.
She felt threatened.

23:39.722 --> 23:42.246
And she wanted
to protect her mother.

23:42.246 --> 23:44.727
That makes it a kidnapping.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.294
Which is a felony.

23:46.294 --> 23:49.558
Since Ava died during
the course of that felony--

23:49.558 --> 23:50.690
It's a felony murder.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.909
There's our homicide case.

23:55.129 --> 23:57.566
We've elevated the charges
to felony murder.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.220
Thank you.

23:59.220 --> 24:01.744
And she's been rearrested
and held without bail.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.355
You have no idea
how much we appreciate that.

24:04.355 --> 24:05.835
We have to warn you.

24:05.835 --> 24:07.315
It's gonna come at a cost.

24:07.315 --> 24:08.925
What do you mean?

24:08.925 --> 24:12.755
There are things that are
gonna come out at trial.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.844
Things about Ava?

24:14.844 --> 24:16.498
Things about the family.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.761
We don't care.
We just want justice for Ava.

24:18.761 --> 24:20.937
But what kind of things?

24:20.937 --> 24:23.592
Ava shared some secrets
with the group.

24:23.592 --> 24:24.680
We don't have
anything to hide.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.334
Right, honey?

24:32.819 --> 24:38.781
She was a free spirit,
so smart and creative.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.653
And she was a musician.

24:40.653 --> 24:43.264
She played the guitar
and she sang.

24:43.264 --> 24:45.962
We wanted her to go
to graduate school at Berkeley.

24:45.962 --> 24:47.747
She'd filled out
the applications,

24:47.747 --> 24:53.666
but, like most creatives,
she had her demons.

24:53.666 --> 24:57.234
She was going through
a period of self-doubt.

24:57.234 --> 25:00.368
Was it during this period
that she was introduced

25:00.368 --> 25:02.892
to the defendant,
Jocelyn Davis?

25:02.892 --> 25:05.199
Yes.

25:05.199 --> 25:10.204
She sucked the life out of her,
took away her autonomy,

25:10.204 --> 25:13.686
imposed harmful
and arbitrary rules.

25:13.686 --> 25:18.212
So the defendant
exercised control over Ava?

25:18.212 --> 25:20.997
Once, when I hadn't
seen Ava in a few weeks,

25:20.997 --> 25:23.783
I begged her
to meet me for lunch.

25:23.783 --> 25:27.917
And were you able
to see your own daughter?

25:27.917 --> 25:31.007
Ava said that she had
to check with Jocelyn.

25:31.007 --> 25:33.270
And Jocelyn told her
that she needed to focus

25:33.270 --> 25:35.011
on her creative enlightenment.

25:35.011 --> 25:39.799
So the defendant
controlled Ava's movements.

25:39.799 --> 25:42.497
She dictated who she could
and couldn't socialize with.

25:42.497 --> 25:43.585
Objection.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.674
Sustained.

25:45.674 --> 25:51.375
Are you aware
of a video confession

25:51.375 --> 25:53.682
Ava made to the defendant?

25:55.554 --> 25:58.078
I don't know
how she found out, but...

25:58.078 --> 26:00.341
Ava knew that I was having
an affair with a colleague,

26:00.341 --> 26:02.604
and she knew that
if it got out, my marriage

26:02.604 --> 26:06.216
and my career
would suffer tremendously.

26:15.748 --> 26:19.099
Was Ava protective of you?

26:19.099 --> 26:22.276
Of your marriage
or your career?

26:22.276 --> 26:23.582
Very.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.803
I believe that Ava
went to her grave

26:27.803 --> 26:30.632
in order to protect my secret.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.242
Thank you.

26:32.242 --> 26:33.940
Nothing further.

26:40.294 --> 26:43.166
You can't prove that
my client used this information

26:43.166 --> 26:45.386
to threaten your daughter,
can you?

26:45.386 --> 26:47.388
Objection--Ms. Newhall
is simply a witness.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.695
Not her burden to prove
or disprove anything.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.522
Sustained.

26:51.522 --> 26:55.483
You can't testify my client
prevented your daughter

26:55.483 --> 26:59.574
from calling a doctor
or going to a hospital.

26:59.574 --> 27:01.532
No, but one can infer.

27:01.532 --> 27:06.712
Here, in a court of law,
we deal in facts and evidence,

27:06.712 --> 27:09.628
not what one can infer.

27:11.978 --> 27:14.763
Your Honor, I have nothing
further for this witness.

27:14.763 --> 27:16.417
I move for a directed verdict.

27:16.417 --> 27:18.854
Your Honor, the people
submit that there's--

27:18.854 --> 27:20.290
Hold it, Mr. Price.

27:22.031 --> 27:24.991
I'll see all counsels
in my chambers.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.384
The people
have no concrete proof

27:27.384 --> 27:29.648
that my client
committed a kidnapping.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.214
There is nothing to show
that Ava Newhall

27:31.214 --> 27:32.868
was being held
against her will.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.522
Mr. Price, is that true?

27:34.522 --> 27:36.959
People are allowed to present
a circumstantial case.

27:36.959 --> 27:39.135
That may be,
but if you can't offer

27:39.135 --> 27:41.529
a direct causal connection
between the defendant

27:41.529 --> 27:45.272
and the victim's failure
to seek medical assistance,

27:45.272 --> 27:47.187
I'm prepared to issue
a directed verdict

27:47.187 --> 27:50.973
and find Jocelyn Davis
not guilty as a matter of law.

27:50.973 --> 27:52.627
That won't be necessary.

27:52.627 --> 27:55.499
We have a witness who will
tie all the elements together

27:55.499 --> 27:57.937
and establish that Ava
wasn't free to leave the loft

27:57.937 --> 27:59.112
and seek medical help.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.983
What are you talking about?

28:00.983 --> 28:03.725
Or better yet,
who are you talking about?

28:03.725 --> 28:04.857
Sienna Barton.

28:04.857 --> 28:07.033
Sienna B--no.

28:07.033 --> 28:10.384
Not a chance in hell
she's gonna cooperate.

28:20.524 --> 28:23.223
I told you before,
I don't want to testify.

28:23.223 --> 28:25.791
Sienna has been
through hell and back.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.968
That is exactly
why I need her.

28:28.968 --> 28:32.319
She has to tell the jury
what she and Ava endured.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.625
We know all the women
in the cult

28:34.625 --> 28:38.629
were required to share
embarrassing things

28:38.629 --> 28:39.587
about their past.

28:41.981 --> 28:45.419
We watched
your video confession.

28:45.419 --> 28:48.378
I know it feels
like a huge deal.

28:48.378 --> 28:51.338
You did something shameful
when you worked at a shelter,

28:51.338 --> 28:52.992
but it's not
the end of the world.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.297
It is for me.

28:54.297 --> 28:55.908
Can't you people
just leave her alone?

28:55.908 --> 28:57.605
Sienna's testimony
is critical.

28:57.605 --> 29:00.390
She can prove that Jocelyn
used the confessions

29:00.390 --> 29:02.610
to threaten women
into submission.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.743
And more specifically,
it'll prove why Ava

29:04.743 --> 29:08.572
was afraid to seek medical help
and ended up dead.

29:08.572 --> 29:09.617
I want to help you, but--

29:09.617 --> 29:11.271
Sienna, like it or not,

29:11.271 --> 29:14.404
you played a role in all this.

29:14.404 --> 29:17.320
You held Ava down
while she was branded.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.322
What exactly are you saying?

29:19.322 --> 29:21.890
She doesn't cooperate,
we will charge her

29:21.890 --> 29:23.370
with several felonies.

29:23.370 --> 29:25.851
Assault, kidnapping, manslaughter.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.200
Are you crazy?

29:27.200 --> 29:29.768
She's the victim here.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.682
She was brainwashed
and branded.

29:31.682 --> 29:34.163
Doesn't mean she didn't
commit a crime too.

29:34.163 --> 29:36.470
She could spend
a few years in prison.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.602
I know that
you have suffered

29:38.602 --> 29:42.345
tremendous emotional
and physical pain.

29:42.345 --> 29:45.261
We wanna hold the person
who did this to you

29:45.261 --> 29:48.308
and who killed Ava responsible.

29:48.308 --> 29:51.137
And to do that,
we need your help.

29:51.137 --> 29:53.139
And if she cooperates?

29:53.139 --> 29:56.142
We'll immunize her.
We'll treat her as a victim.

29:56.142 --> 29:59.710
And she will go back home
with you.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.800
Be smart, Sienna.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.150
Your future depends on it.

30:11.853 --> 30:14.029
Did Jocelyn Davis prevent Ava

30:14.029 --> 30:16.292
from getting medical treatment
for her wound?

30:16.292 --> 30:17.380
Yes.

30:17.380 --> 30:20.166
Did she render
any aid herself?

30:20.166 --> 30:23.560
She told me
she put bandages on the wound,

30:23.560 --> 30:24.953
gave her painkillers.

30:24.953 --> 30:28.130
Can you please tell the jury

30:28.130 --> 30:33.048
how the defendant convinced Ava
to stay in her room?

30:33.048 --> 30:35.572
Jocelyn threatened
to release her confession.

30:35.572 --> 30:37.226
Ava was scared.

30:37.226 --> 30:39.925
She wanted to get help, but she
felt like she had no choice.

30:39.925 --> 30:43.232
Jocelyn Davis
held all the confessions.

30:43.232 --> 30:46.801
She made all the decisions.
She was in charge.

30:46.801 --> 30:49.021
Yes.
Well--

30:49.021 --> 30:51.501
not exactly.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.852
Lodestar was really in charge.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.810
Lodestar?

30:55.810 --> 30:59.031
He's our supreme leader.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.510
Lodestar is a person?

31:01.685 --> 31:03.165
Yes.

31:03.165 --> 31:05.733
We didn't meet him until
after we'd been branded,

31:05.733 --> 31:08.214
after we gave our confessions.

31:08.214 --> 31:09.476
Had Ava met him?

31:09.476 --> 31:12.392
Not yet.
She was going to.

31:12.392 --> 31:15.177
Did Lodestar have influence
over Jocelyn?

31:16.700 --> 31:20.182
He controlled all of us,
including Jocelyn.

31:20.182 --> 31:24.273
He set the rules,
told us where we could go,

31:24.273 --> 31:27.102
who we could socialize with,
what we could eat.

31:27.102 --> 31:30.149
He, um, liked us to be thin.

31:32.934 --> 31:35.154
- And the money?
- He kept our money.

31:35.154 --> 31:36.677
What about the confessions?

31:36.677 --> 31:38.940
Jocelyn sent them to him.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.115
Anything else?

31:40.115 --> 31:42.074
There was the sex.

31:57.828 --> 32:02.094
The real head of the cult
is this guy, Zach Elfont.

32:02.094 --> 32:04.270
He gets Jocelyn Davis
to control

32:04.270 --> 32:05.749
and manipulate the women,

32:05.749 --> 32:07.751
pressure them
to donate money to the cult,

32:07.751 --> 32:10.450
but it's really a guise
for this Zach Elfont guy

32:10.450 --> 32:13.975
to get rich and have sex
with young women.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.585
Sounds like the NXIVM cult.

32:15.585 --> 32:17.631
It's more like
a sick copycat.

32:17.631 --> 32:20.199
No one at NXIVM died
from their branding.

32:20.199 --> 32:22.375
Why are we just learning
about Elfont now?

32:22.375 --> 32:24.203
His name never came up.

32:24.203 --> 32:26.335
Members of the cult have
obviously been protecting him.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.033
But he's the one
calling the shots?

32:28.033 --> 32:29.164
Yes.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.166
Jocelyn gives him
the confessions,

32:31.166 --> 32:32.994
and he uses them
to coerce women

32:32.994 --> 32:34.996
into doing whatever he wants.

32:34.996 --> 32:37.259
So this whole thing
is about pleasing

32:37.259 --> 32:39.435
a sociopathic narcissist?

32:39.435 --> 32:41.916
I wanna charge Elfont
with felony murder.

32:41.916 --> 32:43.178
What's stopping you?

32:43.178 --> 32:45.354
Sienna can't testify about

32:45.354 --> 32:46.965
his involvement
with Ava's death.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.271
I can't prove that
without Jocelyn.

32:49.271 --> 32:51.230
Then try to flip Jocelyn.

32:53.841 --> 32:56.148
We'd like your cooperation.

32:56.148 --> 32:57.758
And in exchange?

32:57.758 --> 32:59.803
We are prepared
to offer full immunity,

32:59.803 --> 33:01.675
dismiss all charges.

33:05.896 --> 33:07.898
I can't.

33:07.898 --> 33:09.726
I can't turn on Lodestar.

33:12.599 --> 33:15.254
We just want you to tell
the truth about what happened.

33:15.254 --> 33:19.084
The truth is,
he's a great guy.

33:19.084 --> 33:21.738
I'd be nothing without him.

33:21.738 --> 33:24.524
I was a 16-year-old punk
when I met Lodestar.

33:24.524 --> 33:25.612
16?

33:25.612 --> 33:27.353
Did he have sex with you
at that age?

33:27.353 --> 33:29.224
That's not important.

33:29.224 --> 33:31.226
You were a minor.

33:31.226 --> 33:35.883
He exerted tremendous
influence over you.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.711
Lodestar saved me.

33:37.711 --> 33:40.757
I grew up
with an abusive stepfather.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.237
I ran away.

33:42.237 --> 33:45.066
I started doing drugs, stealing.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.415
And then I met him.

33:46.415 --> 33:48.287
And he took advantage of you.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.422
I'm not a victim.

33:53.422 --> 33:54.815
He taught me
to stand up for myself,

33:54.815 --> 33:55.816
and that's what I'm doing.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.339
Don't you hear the irony?

33:57.339 --> 34:00.255
He has trained you to believe
that you're not a victim.

34:00.255 --> 34:05.391
And all the while,
he's been victimizing you.

34:05.391 --> 34:07.784
You're facing life in prison
because of him.

34:07.784 --> 34:11.310
Jocelyn, they are
offering a fair deal.

34:11.310 --> 34:14.661
Think about it.
Protect yourself.

34:21.450 --> 34:24.062
We are going to get him

34:24.062 --> 34:26.151
with or without you.

34:30.677 --> 34:32.853
You'll never get anywhere
in your journey

34:32.853 --> 34:35.595
until you stop complaining
about what the world owes you.

34:35.595 --> 34:38.380
The world owes you nothing.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.556
You have to stop acting
like victims.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.690
Excuse me, Lodestar.

34:46.301 --> 34:48.477
- Can I help you?
- We'll see about that. NYPD.

34:48.477 --> 34:49.739
Take your hands
out of your pocket.

34:49.739 --> 34:51.263
Put your hands
behind your back.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.482
Okay, hold on.
What are you doing?

34:53.482 --> 34:56.877
We're taking you on your
own journey to enlightenment.

34:58.444 --> 35:00.185
- He hasn't done anything.
- Stop!

35:00.185 --> 35:01.664
He hasn't done
anything wrong.

35:10.717 --> 35:13.198
We've developed a strong
homicide case

35:13.198 --> 35:15.287
against you, Mr. Elfont.

35:15.287 --> 35:17.289
Jocelyn called me
from the jail.

35:17.289 --> 35:19.160
She said you tried
to pressure her.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.466
She's not gonna
testify against me.

35:22.076 --> 35:23.251
We don't need her testimony.

35:25.471 --> 35:28.952
Forensic analysis of your
phone shows that Jocelyn texted

35:28.952 --> 35:31.303
Ava's confession to you.

35:31.303 --> 35:34.175
I never asked her
to send me those things.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.134
The woman has an unhealthy
obsession with me.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.700
She was jealous of Ava.

35:37.700 --> 35:38.832
Mm-hmm.

35:38.832 --> 35:42.270
We also have GPS
and surveillance video

35:42.270 --> 35:46.013
of your car outside the loft
and near the dumpster

35:46.013 --> 35:47.797
around the time that Ava died.

35:47.797 --> 35:50.278
Jocelyn borrowed
my car all the time.

35:50.278 --> 35:52.846
Bank records show that
Jocelyn sent you all the money

35:52.846 --> 35:54.195
she collected from the women.

35:54.195 --> 35:56.415
I run a business.

35:56.415 --> 35:58.286
I help women who wanna
tap into their creativity.

35:58.286 --> 35:59.940
Jocelyn worked for me.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.898
She helped to collect tuition.

36:01.898 --> 36:07.817
And oh, by the way,
I slept with some of them.

36:07.817 --> 36:10.342
Nothing illegal about that.

36:10.342 --> 36:12.387
All this stuff about branding
and confessions

36:12.387 --> 36:15.825
and cults, it's insane.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.262
I had nothing to do with it.

36:27.141 --> 36:29.578
Elfont has an answer
for everything.

36:29.578 --> 36:33.539
I need Jocelyn to refute the
false narrative he's created.

36:33.539 --> 36:35.715
If you can't get her
to cooperate...

36:35.715 --> 36:37.804
There's a good chance
he skates.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.849
Where are you
with Jocelyn's trial?

36:39.849 --> 36:41.286
It's winding down.

36:41.286 --> 36:44.245
Are you going to get
a conviction?

36:44.245 --> 36:47.205
I believe I am.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.077
Not exactly cause
for despair.

36:50.077 --> 36:52.732
Let's not forget
she's responsible

36:52.732 --> 36:54.255
for Ava Newhall's death.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.257
Elfont was behind it all.

36:56.257 --> 36:59.217
He met her
when she was a teenager.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.435
He groomed her for sex.

37:00.435 --> 37:03.264
He manipulated her
into doing his bidding.

37:03.264 --> 37:07.442
All you can do
is offer her a fair deal.

37:07.442 --> 37:09.444
The rest is up to her.

37:09.444 --> 37:11.359
You're not her lawyer.

37:16.582 --> 37:18.105
I must say, I was pleased

37:18.105 --> 37:20.890
to receive your call
last night.

37:20.890 --> 37:23.589
Well, I was glad too.

37:23.589 --> 37:26.156
Jocelyn and I have done
a lot of talking,

37:26.156 --> 37:29.986
and she does see the importance
of protecting herself here.

37:29.986 --> 37:31.466
That true?

37:31.466 --> 37:33.816
You willing to testify
against him?

37:33.816 --> 37:37.298
Yes. Absolutely.

37:37.298 --> 37:40.170
I want him to pay
for what he did to those girls.

37:41.433 --> 37:44.349
And for what he did to me.

37:46.612 --> 37:51.181
I'm not a bad person,
Mr. Price.

37:51.181 --> 37:52.966
I swear.

37:52.966 --> 37:54.228
I just...

37:56.056 --> 37:57.840
I lost my way.

38:01.017 --> 38:05.326
Those things you said
about manifesting your future,

38:05.326 --> 38:10.157
you're doing that--
right here, right now.

38:10.157 --> 38:11.985
So good for you.

38:18.861 --> 38:21.951
Sam.

38:21.951 --> 38:23.344
Good news.

38:23.344 --> 38:25.172
Jocelyn's lawyer managed
to talk sense into her.

38:25.172 --> 38:26.608
She has agreed to cooperate.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.175
It's too late.

38:28.175 --> 38:31.134
- What do you mean?
- Elfont is dead.

38:31.134 --> 38:32.353
He's dead?

38:32.353 --> 38:34.747
Lodestar mouthed off
to the wrong guy.

38:34.747 --> 38:37.706
Someone beat him to death
in his cell about an hour ago.

38:39.404 --> 38:40.883
You're prepared
to do your closing?

38:42.885 --> 38:45.932
What, you want me
to pull Jocelyn's plea offer?

38:45.932 --> 38:48.238
We don't need
her testimony anymore.

38:48.238 --> 38:50.937
That doesn't change the fact
that she's still a victim.

38:50.937 --> 38:52.417
She <i>was</i> a victim.

38:52.417 --> 38:55.681
At some point,
she became a victimizer.

38:55.681 --> 38:58.814
She recruited
dozens of unsuspecting women,

38:58.814 --> 39:02.383
took their money, groomed them
for sex with this guy.

39:02.383 --> 39:05.560
None of this would have
happened without Elfont.

39:05.560 --> 39:09.303
She killed someone.
She's gotta answer to that.

39:09.303 --> 39:10.870
Would we be having
this conversation

39:10.870 --> 39:12.698
if Jocelyn was a man?

39:15.962 --> 39:19.357
- I thought we had a deal.
- Circumstances changed.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.880
But she was willing
to cooperate.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.665
It's not her fault
that Elfont is dead.

39:23.665 --> 39:25.406
We made her a fair offer.

39:25.406 --> 39:26.973
She waited too long to accept.

39:26.973 --> 39:30.585
You yourself admitted
that she was a victim.

39:30.585 --> 39:35.068
You pleaded with me
to get her to cooperate.

39:35.068 --> 39:37.679
Can we at least come
to some kind of a compromise?

39:37.679 --> 39:39.594
We both know
she doesn't deserve

39:39.594 --> 39:42.945
to spend the rest
of her life in prison.

39:46.906 --> 39:49.735
I understand both parties
have reached an agreement.

39:52.955 --> 39:55.044
My client would like
to change her plea to guilty.

39:55.044 --> 39:57.264
Is that true, Ms. Davis?

39:57.264 --> 40:00.267
Yes.

40:00.267 --> 40:04.271
I just wanna say
to the Newhall family,

40:04.271 --> 40:06.534
I'm so sorry.

40:06.534 --> 40:09.929
I really liked Ava.

40:09.929 --> 40:12.279
I wish I had never gotten
involved in Lodestar,

40:12.279 --> 40:13.846
that I'd never met Zach.

40:15.804 --> 40:18.198
I used to think
I was lucky to know him,

40:18.198 --> 40:20.548
to be in his orbit,

40:20.548 --> 40:23.159
but he used me.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.857
He used all of us.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.471
Thank you, Ms. Davis.

40:30.471 --> 40:33.822
I'll accept your plea
as knowing and voluntary.

40:33.822 --> 40:35.781
Do the people move
for sentencing?

40:35.781 --> 40:38.479
- We do.
- What's your recommendation?

40:38.479 --> 40:40.176
We have an
agreed-upon recommendation

40:40.176 --> 40:42.352
of 12 years in state prison.

40:42.352 --> 40:44.746
The court
hereby sentences you

40:44.746 --> 40:47.270
to serve 12 years
in the state penitentiary.

40:51.187 --> 40:52.406
We're adjourned.

41:05.375 --> 41:07.987
12 years.

41:07.987 --> 41:10.119
If we give a free pass
to everyone

41:10.119 --> 41:11.512
who's ever been victimized,

41:11.512 --> 41:14.515
we'll have to open
the prison gates.
