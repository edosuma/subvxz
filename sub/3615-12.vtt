WEBVTT

00:02.667 --> 00:03.899
I don't get it.

00:03.999 --> 00:05.025
Who'd want to kill me?

00:05.125 --> 00:07.109
We're not sure,
but our sources believe

00:07.209 --> 00:08.401
that your life is in danger.

00:08.501 --> 00:10.359
Protective custody...
Our sources?

00:10.459 --> 00:11.484
What is this,

00:11.584 --> 00:12.359
government surveillance?

00:12.459 --> 00:13.484
You have people watching me?

00:13.584 --> 00:14.609
Mr. Chang, your picture was

00:14.709 --> 00:15.692
in the Metro section today.

00:15.792 --> 00:18.899
Because I planted
some trees.

00:18.999 --> 00:20.317
Mr. Chang,

00:20.417 --> 00:23.526
there were four brutal murders
in the last week

00:23.626 --> 00:25.025
where the only
common denominator is,

00:25.125 --> 00:27.484
the victim's picture was
in the Metro section

00:27.584 --> 00:28.401
the day that they died.

00:28.501 --> 00:29.734
The mayor's in Metro today.

00:29.834 --> 00:30.899
Are you guys harassing him?

00:30.999 --> 00:32.983
Mr. Chang, I am trying
to help you.

00:33.083 --> 00:35.150
I don't have any money,
I don't have any enemies.

00:35.250 --> 00:36.899
Why would anyone want
to kill me?

00:36.999 --> 00:37.899
This is crazy!

00:37.999 --> 00:39.150
(<i>sighs</i>)

00:39.250 --> 00:40.484
PRUE:
All right, so
what do we do

00:40.584 --> 00:42.651
if Darryl
can't convince
him to lay low?

00:42.751 --> 00:43.859
Oh, well,
we follow him, and

00:43.959 --> 00:45.942
if a demon attacks,
we kick some Wiccan ass.

00:46.042 --> 00:46.776
PIPER:
Look who's

00:46.876 --> 00:48.359
back and badder than ever.

00:48.459 --> 00:49.567
It feels good to be back.

00:49.667 --> 00:52.859
It's the best way to put
this whole Cole thing behind me.

00:52.959 --> 00:53.526
PRUE:
Yeah, well,

00:53.626 --> 00:55.734
that's quite a turnaround.

00:55.834 --> 00:56.567
What do you mean?

00:56.667 --> 00:57.526
Well, it's just that,

00:57.626 --> 00:59.899
I mean, you know,
up until last week,

00:59.999 --> 01:01.609
you were kind of quiet, and

01:01.709 --> 01:03.150
not really
interested
in things

01:03.250 --> 01:05.066
demonic, and now...

01:05.167 --> 01:05.899
I am back!

01:05.999 --> 01:06.899
Bad guys beware!
(<i>laughs</i>)

01:06.999 --> 01:09.234
And too bad we don't know
who the bad guy is.

01:09.334 --> 01:13.167
Yeah, well, at least we know
who his next victim is.

01:14.334 --> 01:15.899
PRUE:
Hey.

01:15.999 --> 01:16.526
Hey.

01:16.626 --> 01:18.025
So, did you get anything out
of him?

01:18.125 --> 01:19.317
Just a migraine,
that's about it.

01:19.417 --> 01:21.818
So, what,
you're just gonna let him go?

01:21.918 --> 01:22.899
I don't have
a choice.

01:22.999 --> 01:23.899
He declined
protection.

01:23.999 --> 01:25.067
Phoebe, are you
sure he's the guy

01:25.167 --> 01:27.899
that you saw
get attacked in
your premonition?

01:27.999 --> 01:28.484
Oh, yeah.

01:28.584 --> 01:29.859
And it happened at night, too,

01:29.959 --> 01:31.067
so we can't just let him go.

01:31.167 --> 01:32.025
All right,
then,

01:32.125 --> 01:33.899
we need to
split up
in teams.

01:33.999 --> 01:35.900
First one to
see a demon yells

01:36.000 --> 01:38.334
vanquish, okay?
Come on.

01:54.292 --> 01:56.150
PRUE:
Ugh!

01:56.250 --> 01:57.609
Innocents and alleys.

01:57.709 --> 01:59.025
Don't they ever learn?

01:59.125 --> 02:00.484
Yeah, I know.

02:00.584 --> 02:03.501
Come on.

02:09.918 --> 02:11.125
(<i>grunts</i>)

02:11.918 --> 02:12.999
What the hell?!

02:14.999 --> 02:16.626
(<i>grunts</i>)

02:16.999 --> 02:18.501
(<i>grunting</i>)

02:19.584 --> 02:20.567
You again?
Shut up.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.125
Keep your head down!

02:30.999 --> 02:31.899
What happened?

02:31.999 --> 02:33.401
Why did you let him get away?

02:33.501 --> 02:36.751
I... know that demon.

02:37.167 --> 02:39.918
I dated that demon!

02:40.918 --> 02:43.083
Huh.

03:36.626 --> 03:39.526
DARRYL:
I think they're
lost, Piper.

03:39.626 --> 03:40.859
Dead.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.317
No. They're not.

03:42.417 --> 03:43.275
Completely.

03:43.375 --> 03:44.776
Piper waters
when she's nervous.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.192
There's nothing to
be nervous about.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.067
Mr. Chang's in
protective custody.

03:48.167 --> 03:49.359
No, it's...

03:49.459 --> 03:50.899
It's-It's not him.

03:50.999 --> 03:51.900
It's the whole...

03:52.000 --> 03:53.275
my boyfriend is a demon thing.

03:53.375 --> 03:54.734
It kind of hits a nerve
with all of us.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.442
And obviously,
I'm not that upset because

03:57.542 --> 03:58.899
I'm with Leo,
who is obviously not...

03:58.999 --> 04:01.942
Piper also babbles
when she's nervous.

04:02.042 --> 04:02.899
I resent that.

04:02.999 --> 04:03.900
I am expressing

04:04.000 --> 04:07.442
a valid concern
about this continuing issue

04:07.542 --> 04:08.317
in our lives.

04:08.417 --> 04:09.651
What are you babbling about?

04:09.751 --> 04:10.526
(<i>Phoebe laughs</i>)

04:10.626 --> 04:11.234
PIPER:
You know,

04:11.334 --> 04:13.899
if I could freeze the two
of you, I would, often.

04:13.999 --> 04:15.234
Hmm. All right,
so here's the demon

04:15.334 --> 04:16.692
that we're looking for,
or at least

04:16.791 --> 04:17.942
who he used to be,
Tom Peters.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.983
PHOEBE:
Wait, I didn't know
you dated the captain

04:21.083 --> 04:22.526
of the college
football team.

04:22.626 --> 04:23.317
How suburban.

04:23.417 --> 04:25.359
Yeah, he was a great guy.

04:25.459 --> 04:27.025
DARRYL:
I remember Peters.
He blew out

04:27.125 --> 04:29.401
his knee three weeks
into his rookie year.

04:29.501 --> 04:30.899
What, about five-six years ago?

04:30.999 --> 04:32.275
Leo!
DARRYL:
There were rumors

04:32.375 --> 04:34.692
about gambling debts
and that whole scene.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.899
There was also
a missing person's.

04:36.999 --> 04:38.067
It never got closed.

04:38.167 --> 04:39.942
He just kind of disappeared.

04:40.042 --> 04:41.484
More like went underground.

04:41.584 --> 04:44.359
I wonder if his Mom still lives
in town. Leo!

04:44.459 --> 04:46.609
A woman on a mission?

04:46.709 --> 04:47.692
Mm-hmm.

04:47.792 --> 04:48.899
I guess the captain

04:48.999 --> 04:51.067
of the football team
was a bigger deal

04:51.167 --> 04:52.999
than we ever knew.

04:54.667 --> 04:56.734
Hmm.

04:56.834 --> 04:57.609
Uh, Prue,

04:57.709 --> 04:59.818
are you sure we
should pursue this?

04:59.918 --> 05:01.692
Ask Phoebe.
It was her premonition.

05:01.792 --> 05:03.942
All right, uh,
where on earth is...?

05:04.042 --> 05:05.983
Leo, what took you
so long?

05:06.083 --> 05:07.275
Uh...

05:07.375 --> 05:08.899
Hi.

05:08.999 --> 05:12.275
I, uh, had...
<i>have</i> a situation.

05:12.375 --> 05:13.567
PIPER:
Uh-oh.
You mean

05:13.667 --> 05:14.442
an <i>us</i> situation,

05:14.542 --> 05:15.900
or a <i>you</i> situation?

05:16.000 --> 05:16.526
Hmm.

05:16.626 --> 05:18.401
Oh, don't tell me They've
changed their minds

05:18.501 --> 05:19.818
about us getting
married, because if

05:19.918 --> 05:21.651
that is the case, then
you can just orb me

05:21.751 --> 05:22.859
up there right now, and...

05:22.959 --> 05:23.792
Babbling.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.526
LEO:
It has nothing
to do with Them.

05:25.626 --> 05:26.609
It has to do

05:26.709 --> 05:27.109
with me.

05:27.209 --> 05:31.067
I sort of kind of
lost the wedding ring.

05:31.167 --> 05:32.651
(<i>gasps</i>)

05:32.751 --> 05:33.317
DARRYL:
Got a great

05:33.417 --> 05:35.067
ring guy downtown
if you need one.

05:35.167 --> 05:36.526
He doesn't
need one.

05:36.626 --> 05:37.484
He has a ring!
Mom's ring.

05:37.584 --> 05:39.942
I gave it to him so he
could give it back to me

05:40.042 --> 05:41.899
at the perfect
romantic moment!

05:41.999 --> 05:43.567
PHOEBE:
Wow.

05:43.667 --> 05:44.484
Leo, you lost Mom's ring.

05:44.584 --> 05:46.317
It's a good thing
you're dead already.

05:46.417 --> 05:48.150
I had it in my pocket, Piper.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.109
In all the orbing

05:49.209 --> 05:50.275
in and out, and...

05:50.375 --> 05:50.942
PIPER:
Your orbs

05:51.042 --> 05:52.900
are grass if you do
not find that ring!

05:53.000 --> 05:53.983
PRUE:
All right, hi.
Before blood

05:54.083 --> 05:56.899
is spilled, can I just ask
a business question?

05:56.999 --> 05:57.899
Is it possible

05:57.999 --> 05:59.692
to turn a human into a demon?

05:59.792 --> 06:00.859
Well, there's rumors,

06:00.959 --> 06:03.484
stories about demons
recruiting humans.

06:03.584 --> 06:06.734
So, join the evil
and see the underworld?

06:06.834 --> 06:07.204
Kind of.

06:07.214 --> 06:09.359
Apparently, the demons
go after humans in need

06:09.459 --> 06:11.025
and strike your classic
Faustian deal.

06:11.125 --> 06:14.317
But then the humans are forced
into this training academy,

06:14.417 --> 06:16.484
a program
that destroys their humanity.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.192
And turns them
into demons.

06:18.292 --> 06:19.899
Right, and when
the recruits graduate,

06:19.999 --> 06:20.823
they have to kill an innocent

06:20.923 --> 06:22.983
to seal the demonic
conversion permanently.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.109
DARRYL:
Yeah, it's like

06:24.209 --> 06:24.942
a-a gang initiation.

06:25.042 --> 06:28.025
You go out and kill
the first person that you see,

06:28.125 --> 06:28.899
and you're in the gang.

06:28.999 --> 06:31.401
Well, that explains
your four random killings.

06:31.501 --> 06:33.899
Maybe it's graduation time
at the academy.

06:33.999 --> 06:35.234
PRUE:
Well, if it is, Tom is one

06:35.334 --> 06:37.609
human that they're not going
to demonize.

06:37.709 --> 06:40.067
Hmm, Prue, how do you
know we're not too late?

06:40.167 --> 06:42.275
I mean, if we didn't get there
on time and stop him...

06:42.375 --> 06:43.692
He would have killed
an innocent,

06:43.792 --> 06:44.899
and then
it would have been too late.

06:44.999 --> 06:47.899
But we did stop him, so now
we still have time to save him.

06:47.999 --> 06:48.899
All right, I'm
gonna go talk

06:48.999 --> 06:51.109
to Tom's mother, see
if she knows anything.

06:51.209 --> 06:52.067
Maybe you guys can come up

06:52.167 --> 06:54.999
with, like, a spell
to find him or something?

07:02.083 --> 07:02.900
(<i>clears throat</i>)

07:03.000 --> 07:04.776
Mr. Kellman, I swear

07:04.876 --> 07:07.109
I can make this right,
I swear it!

07:07.209 --> 07:08.818
I was clear, wasn't I?

07:08.918 --> 07:12.484
I make your problems go away,
and you owe me.

07:12.584 --> 07:14.359
Now, did you forget

07:14.459 --> 07:16.401
about the last part of the deal?

07:16.501 --> 07:18.317
I-I <i>can</i> pay you back, okay?

07:18.417 --> 07:20.734
I-I just n-need more time.

07:20.834 --> 07:22.459
More time?

07:26.542 --> 07:29.250
You don't have any more time.

07:31.959 --> 07:34.918
Your debt is due
and payable...

07:35.751 --> 07:36.734
now!

07:36.834 --> 07:38.359
Please...!

07:38.459 --> 07:41.042
I-I'll do
anything.

08:00.626 --> 08:02.899
Now, I don't have
to go over all of this

08:02.999 --> 08:04.899
again with you, too, Tom, do I?

08:04.999 --> 08:06.776
Temporary setback,
Mr. Kellman.

08:06.876 --> 08:08.025
It won't
happen again.

08:08.125 --> 08:08.899
You know,

08:08.999 --> 08:11.359
you're not the only one
exposed here.

08:11.459 --> 08:12.692
You got a contract with me,

08:12.792 --> 08:14.899
and I got a contract
with the Source--

08:14.999 --> 08:15.818
five full graduates

08:15.918 --> 08:17.899
by tomorrow night.
Now all the others

08:17.999 --> 08:20.484
have made <i>their</i> kills.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.942
What's the problem?

08:22.042 --> 08:25.025
A witch intervened.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.442
What?!

08:26.542 --> 08:28.542
A witch?

08:28.999 --> 08:30.899
How the hell did that happen?

08:30.999 --> 08:32.775
I don't know,
but I wasn't followed.

08:32.876 --> 08:35.609
I-I used every safeguard
I learned in the academy.

08:35.708 --> 08:38.275
Well, she must be tracking
the innocent.

08:38.375 --> 08:39.818
We'll have to get you
another one,

08:39.918 --> 08:42.000
but we're running out
of time here.

08:43.042 --> 08:44.899
Just kill this one.

08:44.999 --> 08:46.899
But do it fast,

08:46.999 --> 08:49.000
or else there'll be hell to pay.

You have to tell them, Phoebe.

You can't wait any longer.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.150

09:09.999 --> 09:10.692
Yeah, well,

09:10.792 --> 09:12.317
how about we skip
the confession part

09:12.417 --> 09:13.651
and go straight
to penance, okay?

09:13.751 --> 09:15.442
I will be such
a force for good,

09:15.542 --> 09:17.067
the bad guys won't know
what hit them.

09:17.167 --> 09:19.484
You can't pretend
it didn't happen, Phoebe.

09:19.584 --> 09:23.459
Yeah, and I can't change
the fact that it did, Leo.

09:23.999 --> 09:25.899
So, if you will excuse me,

09:25.999 --> 09:28.109
I have a demon to vanquish.

09:28.209 --> 09:30.501
And you have a ring to find.

09:36.751 --> 09:39.359
Scrying for witches,
a spell to find a lost love,

09:39.459 --> 09:41.983
but there's nothing in here
about how to find a demon.

09:42.083 --> 09:45.567
Oh, well, probably 'cause
they usually find us.

09:45.667 --> 09:46.899
Well, there's got to be a way.

09:46.999 --> 09:49.067
If there is,
Prue's gonna have to find it.

09:49.167 --> 09:50.609
Um, was there
anything

09:50.709 --> 09:52.692
in there, you know,

09:52.792 --> 09:53.899
to help Leo find my ring?

09:53.999 --> 09:54.899
Piper, we can't just give up.

09:54.999 --> 09:57.859
We have to find this demon
before he kills somebody.

09:57.959 --> 10:00.834
Okay, well, do you got a spell?

10:01.584 --> 10:03.417
Maybe.

(<i>sighs</i>)

10:26.250 --> 10:27.899
(<i>footsteps approaching</i>)

10:27.999 --> 10:29.999
I'm afraid to ask.

10:30.999 --> 10:31.899
Just

10:31.999 --> 10:33.899
something that I thought
that I needed

10:33.999 --> 10:35.983
and then decided that I didn't.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.751
Okay.

10:40.999 --> 10:43.484
It's a lost and found spell.

10:43.584 --> 10:44.484
Wow.

10:44.584 --> 10:45.999
Perfect timing.

10:46.709 --> 10:47.776
Do I want to know

10:47.876 --> 10:49.999
what you were trying to find?

10:53.292 --> 10:55.459
(<i>Phoebe sighs</i>)

10:58.999 --> 11:00.899
Cole.

11:00.999 --> 11:02.442
Cole?

11:02.542 --> 11:03.275
Honey,

11:03.375 --> 11:04.025
you were trying

11:04.125 --> 11:06.999
to bring a demon back
from the dead?

11:08.250 --> 11:09.709
No.

11:10.459 --> 11:12.584
He's still alive.

11:13.250 --> 11:15.359
I never really vanquished him.

11:15.459 --> 11:16.899
I'm sorry.
It's over,

11:16.999 --> 11:19.999
he's not coming back,
and I don't want him to, either.

11:21.167 --> 11:24.234
Phoebe, you... you let him go?

11:24.334 --> 11:25.567
Are you out of your mind?!

11:25.667 --> 11:28.192
He's not after us anymore,
he won't hurt us.

11:28.292 --> 11:30.359
No, you-you don't know that.

11:30.459 --> 11:32.234
Yes, I do.

11:32.334 --> 11:33.899
(<i>sighs</i>)
PHOEBE:
Piper,

11:33.999 --> 11:35.275
I-I just...

11:35.375 --> 11:37.584
I couldn't kill him.

11:38.709 --> 11:42.401
Phoebe, you lied to us!

11:42.501 --> 11:43.899
I know.

11:43.999 --> 11:45.275
I'm sorry.

11:45.375 --> 11:45.899
So this is where

11:45.999 --> 11:48.067
this new Wonder Woman
attitude comes from...

11:48.167 --> 11:49.609
a guilty conscience?

11:49.709 --> 11:50.692
No.

11:50.792 --> 11:52.109
Well... maybe.

11:52.209 --> 11:53.651
I don't know.

11:53.751 --> 11:54.651
(<i>sighs</i>)

11:54.751 --> 11:56.983
You have to tell Prue.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.734
Hmm.

11:58.834 --> 12:00.401
She won't understand.

12:00.501 --> 12:04.000
Yeah, well,
she's not the only one.

12:08.999 --> 12:09.734
He was so fast.

12:09.834 --> 12:12.192
His coach said he could
have run track, too,

12:12.292 --> 12:14.899
but all Tom cares
about is football.

12:14.999 --> 12:17.192
I'm so sorry that we lost touch,

12:17.292 --> 12:18.651
but, um...

12:18.751 --> 12:21.983
what happened after he got hurt?

12:22.083 --> 12:23.859
He was depressed.

12:23.959 --> 12:24.899
I understood.

12:24.999 --> 12:27.899
So the stories that I heard
about his being in trouble....

12:27.999 --> 12:28.983
The gambling rumors?

12:29.083 --> 12:30.900
No. Don't believe a word of it.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.109
No one ever came to
me looking for money.

12:33.209 --> 12:35.192
And Mr. Kellman would've told me
if there was

12:35.292 --> 12:36.899
a problem.
Mr. Kellman?

12:36.999 --> 12:37.899
His business manager.

12:37.999 --> 12:39.651
He took such
good care of Tom.

12:39.751 --> 12:42.651
And he was a wonderful help
to me after Tom...

12:42.751 --> 12:44.459
went away.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.999
Mrs. Peters...

12:49.542 --> 12:51.501
What do you think happened?

12:51.751 --> 12:54.900
I think Tom
has some things to take care of.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.899
And he'll be home when he can.

12:57.999 --> 12:59.899
I know it in my heart.

13:27.209 --> 13:30.150

with a whole ritual that fast?

13:30.250 --> 13:32.401

as you would think.

13:36.918 --> 13:39.526
I really appreciate you guys
doing this for me.

13:39.626 --> 13:40.651
She didn't exactly

13:40.751 --> 13:42.067
do it for you.
Okay.

13:42.167 --> 13:42.899
So...

13:42.999 --> 13:43.899
what did Tom's mother say?

13:43.999 --> 13:45.859
Poor lady, she talks about him

13:45.959 --> 13:47.359
like he's been gone a week

13:47.459 --> 13:48.234
as opposed to six years.

13:48.334 --> 13:50.899
And she actually thinks
he's coming back.

13:50.999 --> 13:51.734
Based on...

13:51.834 --> 13:53.734
Faith, and I would like
to prove her right.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.899
Well, we're doing
everything we can.

13:55.999 --> 13:56.899
Yeah, and you know what?

13:56.999 --> 13:57.787
We have saved bad boys before.

13:57.797 --> 14:00.484
I mean, what about the priest
with the warlock brothers?

14:00.584 --> 14:02.899
Yeah, but Prue,
he wanted to be saved.

14:02.999 --> 14:04.942
Can you guarantee that
about Tom?

14:05.042 --> 14:06.734
Or any other
demon-human mix?

14:06.834 --> 14:08.899
This is not
about Cole, okay?

14:08.999 --> 14:10.692
That's a whole
other subject.

14:10.792 --> 14:11.818
One worth discussing.

14:11.918 --> 14:13.899
Am I missing something here?

14:13.999 --> 14:14.692
BOTH:
Yes.

14:14.792 --> 14:15.899
PHOEBE:
Actually...

14:15.999 --> 14:16.776
we're missing Tom.

14:16.876 --> 14:18.526
And he's someone
we should probably

14:18.626 --> 14:19.329
continue talking about.

14:19.339 --> 14:21.942
So if this spell works,
and we actually find him,

14:22.042 --> 14:22.899
what do we do?

14:22.999 --> 14:23.983
Do we vanquish him?

14:24.083 --> 14:26.317
Well, I'm hoping
that it won't come to that.

14:26.417 --> 14:27.900
Yeah, but what if it does, Prue?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.250

into the street,

that might do the trick.

About the demonic

18:53.918 --> 18:55.899
when you
answered the door.
Ah.

18:55.999 --> 18:57.401
DARRYL:
How'd it change?

18:57.501 --> 18:58.025
Um, well, it must be

18:58.125 --> 19:00.234
because I colored my hair
in that sink,

19:00.334 --> 19:02.526
so technically,
I lost it there

19:02.626 --> 19:03.899
and now I've found it again.

19:03.999 --> 19:04.776
(<i>smacks counter</i>)

19:04.876 --> 19:06.899
I hope this doesn't
affect my virginity.

19:06.999 --> 19:08.983
Wait, so everything
is coming back

19:09.083 --> 19:10.192
to where it was lost?

19:10.292 --> 19:11.899
That means you
lost your vir...

19:11.999 --> 19:12.709
(<i>gasps</i>)

19:14.999 --> 19:17.526
Okay, so it's a
big side effect.

19:17.626 --> 19:18.899
PIPER:
Those better be clean.

19:18.999 --> 19:22.776
If not, it's laundry day
for you, missy.

19:22.876 --> 19:24.442
You don't scare me.

19:24.542 --> 19:28.150
I've been trained
to deal with witches.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.899
I'd forgotten
how proud you were

19:29.999 --> 19:31.900
when we knew each other.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.834
I've forgotten
you completely.

19:35.999 --> 19:37.192
You don't want to tell me
what happened,

19:37.292 --> 19:40.442
because you don't want to admit
how badly you screwed up.

19:40.542 --> 19:41.651
I didn't.

19:41.751 --> 19:43.734
It's obvious.

19:43.834 --> 19:44.859
While you were still human,

19:44.959 --> 19:47.150
you were stupid enough
to enter into some

19:47.250 --> 19:48.359
demonic contract.

19:48.459 --> 19:49.899
I was never human.

19:49.999 --> 19:50.734
You had to have been.

19:50.834 --> 19:53.234
Otherwise you wouldn't have
made it to the academy.

19:53.334 --> 19:55.359
Yes, I know
about the academy.

19:55.459 --> 19:56.484
I know about the chevrons.

19:56.584 --> 19:57.899
I also know that you haven't

19:57.999 --> 19:59.317
killed your innocent yet.

19:59.417 --> 20:01.751
I will.

20:01.999 --> 20:03.567
You'll have to
get past me first.

20:03.667 --> 20:06.859
Kellman will kill
us both if I don't!

20:06.959 --> 20:08.959
Kellman?

20:09.792 --> 20:10.692
Tom...

20:10.792 --> 20:11.484
I know who you are,

20:11.584 --> 20:13.818
the person that you were,
all right?

20:13.918 --> 20:14.484
And I know that

20:14.584 --> 20:17.167
somewhere in there
it still exists.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.899
Look, Tom,

20:19.999 --> 20:21.692
this is who you are, all right?

20:21.792 --> 20:22.900
This is who your mother

20:23.000 --> 20:24.999
is waiting for.

20:25.999 --> 20:28.899
Vanquish me...

20:28.999 --> 20:31.000
or I will kill you, witch.

20:33.167 --> 20:34.692
Neither is going to happen,
all right?

20:34.792 --> 20:35.899
I am going to save you
from yourself,

20:35.999 --> 20:38.751
whether you like it or not.
(<i>drops album</i>)

20:44.876 --> 20:47.899
Okay, so I think
I have an idea how...

20:47.999 --> 20:50.317
Whoa!
Yeah.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.776
My lost and found spell's

20:51.876 --> 20:53.025
a little too enthusiastic.

20:53.125 --> 20:54.275
PIPER:
We're finding stuff

20:54.375 --> 20:55.899
all over the house.
It's endless.

20:55.999 --> 20:56.579
I don't mean to sound

20:56.589 --> 20:58.317
paranoid, but, uh,
after all these years,

20:58.417 --> 20:59.609
I think I've earned that right.

20:59.709 --> 21:01.192
How do you know
that your spell

21:01.292 --> 21:03.859
is not gonna find demons
that you've already vanquished?

21:03.959 --> 21:05.567
Oh, you mean like Belthazor?

21:05.667 --> 21:07.859
PRUE:
Okay, one demon at a time.

21:07.959 --> 21:08.900
Did you get anything on Tom?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.275
Just his missing person's file.

21:10.375 --> 21:13.359
All right, anything
on a man named Kellman?

21:13.459 --> 21:14.999
(<i>distant thud</i>)

21:15.667 --> 21:16.859
What was that?

21:16.959 --> 21:18.692
That would be Tom escaping.

21:18.792 --> 21:19.150
What?!

21:19.250 --> 21:20.609
Yeah, I loosened his ropes.

21:20.709 --> 21:22.067
I'm hoping to track him down
to the demon

21:22.167 --> 21:23.192
that turned him, break him,

21:23.292 --> 21:24.651
break his hold on Tom.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.899
Anything you can get me
on Kellman

21:26.999 --> 21:27.899
I'd appreciate, okay?

21:27.999 --> 21:29.859
All right, I guess
we're going now.

21:29.959 --> 21:32.959
Shouldn't we reverse
this spell first?

21:33.417 --> 21:35.999
(<i>wind gusting</i>)

21:39.999 --> 21:42.375
Whoo!

21:52.584 --> 21:53.734
All right, you ready?

21:53.834 --> 21:54.899
Ready for what?

21:54.999 --> 21:56.918
To save him.

22:09.667 --> 22:10.484
Where'd he go?

22:10.584 --> 22:11.120
Doesn't make any sense.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.999
If he could vanish,
he would've done it before.

22:14.292 --> 22:17.918
I got a bad feeling
about this.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.776
KELLMAN:
It's not just about strength.

22:23.876 --> 22:28.899
Identify the primary weakness,
capitalize on it,

22:28.999 --> 22:31.734
zero in and crush him.

22:31.834 --> 22:33.834
I have good news,
Mr. Kellman.

22:34.999 --> 22:36.899
Did you kill the innocent?

22:36.999 --> 22:40.859
Better. I can deliver
you three witches.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.751
Witches?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.818
I don't care about witches.

22:44.918 --> 22:46.792
I care about deadlines!

22:47.334 --> 22:48.567
Yours and mine!

22:48.667 --> 22:49.442
You know, if I weren't

22:49.542 --> 22:51.899
running out of time,
I'd have you drum...

22:51.999 --> 22:53.484
(<i>sniffs</i>)

22:53.584 --> 22:57.899
Is that humanity I'm sensing
from you?

22:57.999 --> 22:59.859
Huh?

22:59.959 --> 23:00.899
Now had did that come back?

23:00.999 --> 23:04.192
That was supposed to be
drummed out of you by now.

23:04.292 --> 23:06.792
You need a refresher course.

23:14.999 --> 23:15.442
This is weird.

23:15.542 --> 23:17.859
So Kellman poses as a human
and then what,

23:17.959 --> 23:20.567
gives athletes a way out
of their problems?

23:20.667 --> 23:21.442
Yeah, a demonic way out.

23:21.542 --> 23:23.942
All right, what
about your lost
and found spell?

23:24.042 --> 23:26.609
Do you think that you could
rewrite it to find Tom?

23:26.709 --> 23:28.734
Huh. Maybe.

23:28.834 --> 23:29.692
Um, how about...

23:29.792 --> 23:34.275
"Show me the path
that I cannot find

23:34.375 --> 23:34.899
"to save Tom

23:34.999 --> 23:37.983
and restore Prue's
peace of mind."

(<i>rumbling</i>)

23:43.334 --> 23:44.234
Oh, whoa.

23:44.334 --> 23:45.609
Way to go, Pheebs.

23:45.709 --> 23:46.899
KELLMAN:
No, wait.

23:46.999 --> 23:48.792
I want him to watch.

23:59.918 --> 24:01.709

Oh, yeah.

24:12.000 --> 24:12.818
(<i>groaning</i>)

24:12.918 --> 24:15.067
You want your mama? Huh?
Say it!

24:15.167 --> 24:17.317
You want your
mama!? Huh?

24:17.417 --> 24:19.626
(<i>laughing</i>)

24:19.999 --> 24:21.442
Remind me again

24:21.542 --> 24:22.899
why we are doing this?

24:22.999 --> 24:24.317
Because your sisters
have a thing

24:24.417 --> 24:25.234
for saving bad boys.
Mm.

24:25.334 --> 24:26.899
If I die
before I get married,

24:26.999 --> 24:30.025
I'm going to be really mad
at the two of you.

(<i>all gasping</i>)

(<i>all screaming</i>)

24:36.459 --> 24:38.734
(<i>groaning</i>)

24:38.834 --> 24:41.899
Oh, God!

24:41.999 --> 24:42.899
Mm.

24:42.999 --> 24:45.484
Okay, I'd still
like to point out

24:45.584 --> 24:49.918
that I have a really
bad feeling about this.

24:50.375 --> 24:53.209
(<i>man shouting</i>)

24:56.542 --> 24:57.899
(<i>grunting</i>)

24:57.999 --> 24:59.734
What the...?

24:59.834 --> 25:01.959
Oh, no.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.751
I'm the man.

25:06.918 --> 25:08.584
(<i>laughing</i>)

25:10.999 --> 25:15.167
(<i>shrieking</i>)

25:17.959 --> 25:20.792
(<i>screaming</i>)

25:30.999 --> 25:32.999
Next!

25:35.209 --> 25:37.167
Tom.

25:50.834 --> 25:51.899
(<i>laughs</i>)

25:51.999 --> 25:53.083
Okay.

25:53.876 --> 25:55.401
Tom.
Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

25:55.501 --> 25:57.999
Whoa!
Are you nuts?!

26:01.209 --> 26:02.667
WRESTLER:
Come on, Tommy.

26:04.584 --> 26:07.359
Maybe we need to go back up top
and rethink this whole thing.

26:07.459 --> 26:08.275
Oh, you know what, Phoebe?

26:08.375 --> 26:08.995
That would be such a great plan

26:09.005 --> 26:10.567
if Tom weren't seconds away
from annihilation.

26:10.667 --> 26:13.692
Okay, so we're supposed
to risk our lives

26:13.792 --> 26:14.484
to save a demon?

26:14.584 --> 26:15.818
Of course,
it's okay now

26:15.918 --> 26:16.899
that it's your demon, right?

26:16.999 --> 26:18.234
The thing is,
isn't it silly

26:18.334 --> 26:20.651
for the three of us
to sacrifice ourselves

26:20.751 --> 26:22.776
for one guy,
whatever kind

26:22.876 --> 26:24.167
of guy he was?

26:26.501 --> 26:28.609
WRESTLER:
That's what a demon is,

26:28.709 --> 26:30.209
little man!

26:35.999 --> 26:37.899
All right, what kind
of witches would we be

26:37.999 --> 26:39.275
if we started playing odds,

26:39.375 --> 26:40.818
if we started picking
and choosing

26:40.918 --> 26:41.818
our innocents,
all right?

26:41.918 --> 26:44.999
This-this is what we do,
isn't it?

26:47.292 --> 26:49.442
Then let's do it.

26:49.542 --> 26:50.899
Okay.

26:50.999 --> 26:52.999
But...
Tom!

26:59.999 --> 27:00.959
Oh!

27:05.584 --> 27:09.067
Your little parlor tricks may
work on some of the newer boys,

27:09.167 --> 27:13.792
but the rest of us
will be a little tougher.

27:18.876 --> 27:21.899
Man, you can't do that
around here!

27:21.999 --> 27:23.899
I can't sense the
girls anywhere,

27:23.999 --> 27:24.734
which is never good.

27:24.834 --> 27:25.818
Do you know where
they might be?

27:25.918 --> 27:28.609
(<i>sighs</i>):
They were tailing their demon,

27:28.709 --> 27:29.899
hoping he would
lead them

27:29.999 --> 27:32.734
to his... bigger demon.

27:32.834 --> 27:33.454
Do they know who that is?

27:33.464 --> 27:35.899
Prue asked me to check
on a manager named Kellman.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.234
He paid all
of Tom's bills

27:37.334 --> 27:38.359
after he disappeared, but...

27:38.459 --> 27:39.942
Could be the recruiter.
Do you have an address?

27:40.042 --> 27:43.317
You think Kellman's
a demon?

27:43.417 --> 27:44.900
Well, what kind of powers
do you think

27:45.000 --> 27:47.609
we should expect?

27:47.709 --> 27:52.692
Oh, see, okay, now,
that ain't right.

27:52.792 --> 27:53.776
KELLMAN:
You girls are

27:53.876 --> 27:55.899
way out of your
league down here.

27:55.999 --> 27:57.359
You have no idea.

27:57.459 --> 27:59.651
Well, we know that you have
a deadline, Mr. Kellman.

27:59.751 --> 28:02.417
Time to deliver
your recruits?

28:02.709 --> 28:05.109
And you think you
can stop me, hmm?

28:05.209 --> 28:06.234
Think you can

28:06.334 --> 28:07.401
save him?

28:07.501 --> 28:09.442
I kind of admire

28:09.542 --> 28:10.245
that level of arrogance.

28:10.255 --> 28:13.067
Thanks. We kind of like
to think of it as confidence.

28:13.167 --> 28:15.899
Well, get over it. He's lost.

28:15.999 --> 28:17.651
TOM:
I made a deal.

28:17.751 --> 28:19.834
I stand by it.

28:23.792 --> 28:25.942
KELLMAN:
Now, you see that?
Now that's what I call

28:26.042 --> 28:27.899
a quick recovery, huh?

28:27.999 --> 28:30.275
Knocked the humanity
right out of him.

28:30.375 --> 28:30.899
And we got

28:30.999 --> 28:34.067
a perfect kill
for him, too.

28:34.167 --> 28:36.999
Uh, not if we put him on ice.

28:37.999 --> 28:42.959
Kind of hard to make him kill
an innocent now, huh?

28:44.667 --> 28:45.942
Unfreeze him.

28:46.042 --> 28:46.999
Nope.

28:47.709 --> 28:48.150
Ah...

28:48.250 --> 28:51.834
If anything happens to me,
he's going to stay that way.

28:54.459 --> 28:56.401
(<i>whispering</i>):
Is that true?

28:56.501 --> 28:58.209
(<i>growls</i>):
Yes!

28:58.999 --> 28:59.983
You're bluffing.

29:00.083 --> 29:01.501
Are we?

29:05.792 --> 29:06.899
I'm listening.

29:06.999 --> 29:09.899
All right, how about
three witches in exchange

29:09.999 --> 29:10.899
for Tom's soul?

29:10.999 --> 29:13.317
Prue!
If we win, we get Tom back.

29:13.417 --> 29:16.567
If we lose, you get Tom
and the three of us.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.150
Risk one to gain four.

29:18.250 --> 29:22.083
You really think
you can win in the ring?

29:22.792 --> 29:23.287
Well, you know,

29:23.297 --> 29:24.651
we don't really have
much of a choice,

29:24.751 --> 29:26.109
but if we do win,
we don't go

29:26.209 --> 29:27.401
into the training program.

29:27.501 --> 29:28.234
We go free.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.751
Did your homework.

29:34.375 --> 29:35.900
Okay. You got a deal.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.859
You win, you go free;
but if you lose,

29:39.959 --> 29:41.609
you die.

29:41.709 --> 29:42.192
(<i>groans</i>)

29:42.292 --> 29:43.275
KELLMAN:
I can't control

29:43.375 --> 29:44.609
what happens
in the ring.

29:44.709 --> 29:46.150
Only the Source can.

29:46.250 --> 29:47.692
Understood.

29:47.792 --> 29:48.692
Hey.

29:48.792 --> 29:51.442
You know that bad feeling
I was talking about?

29:51.542 --> 29:52.734
It's getting
stronger.

29:52.834 --> 29:53.899
All right, you need
to stay here

29:53.999 --> 29:54.899
and keep Tom frozen, okay?

29:54.999 --> 29:56.567
I hate this crappy
freezing power!

29:56.667 --> 29:57.859
All right,
our powers seem to have

29:57.959 --> 29:58.900
a limited effect on these guys,

29:59.000 --> 30:00.359
so we're going to have
to outmaneuver them.

30:00.459 --> 30:03.150
And outsmart them and keep
our shoulders off the mat.

30:03.250 --> 30:03.776
Piece of cake.

30:03.876 --> 30:06.651
So I guess we're as ready
as we're ever going to be.

30:06.751 --> 30:08.275
Uh, Prue,
there's one more thing.

30:08.375 --> 30:09.709
Now?

30:09.834 --> 30:11.792
Now is your perfect moment?

30:11.999 --> 30:12.899
Piper, we might die in there.

30:12.999 --> 30:14.484
That doesn't mean
you should tell her now.

30:14.584 --> 30:17.083
Okay, tell me what?

30:18.501 --> 30:19.501
Uh...

30:20.000 --> 30:20.899
(<i>laughs</i>)

30:20.999 --> 30:23.334
Cole is still alive.

30:24.667 --> 30:26.899
I never really vanquished him.

30:26.999 --> 30:28.334
What?!

30:28.959 --> 30:29.942
KELLMAN:
By the way,

30:30.042 --> 30:31.899
since you're witches...

30:31.999 --> 30:35.959
I think it's only fair
that I even the playing field.

30:52.834 --> 30:53.692
Look at this face!

30:53.792 --> 30:56.899
This is the face of pain,
and I'm the bringer of pain!

30:56.999 --> 30:58.567
And I'm going to destroy you!

30:58.667 --> 31:00.192
You'll be crying
for mercy,

31:00.292 --> 31:03.292
but I don't know the meaning
of the word!

31:03.834 --> 31:06.692
All right, some people think
this is entertainment.

31:06.792 --> 31:07.417
Prue...

31:09.209 --> 31:10.401
Uh, are we okay?

31:10.501 --> 31:11.776
Not by a long shot.

31:11.876 --> 31:12.484
Look, Phoebe,

31:12.584 --> 31:14.734
if you waited till now
to tell me about Cole

31:14.834 --> 31:15.609
in hopes that
we would die

31:15.709 --> 31:16.859
and you wouldn't
have to deal with me,

31:16.959 --> 31:18.918
you have another
think coming.

31:19.334 --> 31:22.834
I think that went well.

31:33.876 --> 31:34.359
All right,

31:34.459 --> 31:35.899
I'm going to
win this fight

31:35.999 --> 31:36.579
and save your ass.

31:36.589 --> 31:39.999
That way I can kick
it myself later.

31:41.501 --> 31:42.999
Hi!

31:48.959 --> 31:51.584
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

31:54.999 --> 31:57.417
(<i>grunting</i>)

31:59.667 --> 32:00.999
Wow!

32:13.667 --> 32:14.876
Okay. Oh, God.

32:15.918 --> 32:16.999
Oh, God!

32:17.999 --> 32:19.651
Come on, do something!
Get angry!

32:19.751 --> 32:20.983
Focus! Get motivated!

32:21.083 --> 32:24.275
Prue, listen to me!
She lied to you big time!

32:24.375 --> 32:26.042
Big time lying to you!

32:27.667 --> 32:28.317
Come on,

32:28.417 --> 32:29.192
get angry!

32:29.292 --> 32:30.109
Come on!

32:30.209 --> 32:32.401
Or else we're
in big deep...

32:32.501 --> 32:32.994
Phoebe, she thinks

32:33.004 --> 32:35.401
you're a weakling,
like, big time sucker

32:35.501 --> 32:36.292
for love.

32:36.834 --> 32:37.609
Oh, God!

32:37.709 --> 32:38.459
Oh!

32:39.918 --> 32:41.899
(<i>gasps</i>)

32:41.999 --> 32:43.859
(<i>grunting</i>)

32:43.959 --> 32:45.459
Piper!

32:51.667 --> 32:53.317
Called your bluff.

32:53.417 --> 32:55.792
Piper?!

32:56.167 --> 32:57.167
Ooh, ooh!

32:57.918 --> 32:58.709
Oh!

33:18.626 --> 33:22.899
Let's go see how
Mom is doing, shall we?

33:22.999 --> 33:24.484
(<i>laughing</i>)

33:24.584 --> 33:27.918
Slammer. Yeah, baby!

33:39.167 --> 33:41.167
Say good night!

33:43.042 --> 33:44.692
(<i>grunting</i>)

33:44.792 --> 33:47.484
(<i>screaming</i>)

33:47.584 --> 33:50.999
(<i>panting</i>)

33:52.459 --> 33:54.109
Oh! Prue!

33:54.209 --> 33:56.667
(<i>shrieking</i>)

33:59.250 --> 34:00.150
PHOEBE:
Prue! Prue!

34:00.250 --> 34:02.401
(<i>Phoebe shrieks</i>)

34:02.501 --> 34:04.000
(<i>laughing</i>)

34:11.208 --> 34:12.192
Thank you!

34:12.292 --> 34:13.567
All right, we have
to save Piper.

34:13.667 --> 34:15.998
How do we do that?
By kicking ass.

34:30.998 --> 34:33.899
All right. One, two, three!

34:33.998 --> 34:37.458
(<i>screaming</i>)

34:48.501 --> 34:49.899
Anybody else want
a piece of this?

34:49.998 --> 34:51.567
Prue, it looks really bad.

34:51.667 --> 34:53.899
I don't know if we're
gonna make it to Leo.

34:53.998 --> 34:56.208
Yeah, we will. Come on.

35:03.667 --> 35:04.526
Leo!

35:04.626 --> 35:05.484
LEO:
What happened?!

35:05.584 --> 35:07.999
PRUE:
Hurry, I think she's
stopped breathing.

35:19.417 --> 35:21.250
It's working.

35:21.751 --> 35:24.192
Okay, not that I'm
not thrilled to see you,

35:24.292 --> 35:26.275
but what are you
doing here, Leo?

35:26.375 --> 35:27.025
I was looking for you.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.818
I thought
I'd start with Kellman.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.442
He's the recruiter.
I figured.

35:30.542 --> 35:31.983
The Elders think the key
to destroying him

35:32.083 --> 35:33.899
is to turn one
of his recruits against him.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.983
PHOEBE:
So first we have
to figure out

35:36.083 --> 35:36.942
a way to save Tom.

35:37.042 --> 35:38.109
All right, so I'll call Morris,

35:38.209 --> 35:39.526
get him to bring
Tom's mom to the manor.

35:39.626 --> 35:41.983
Then we just have to figure out
a way to get <i>Tom</i> there.

35:42.083 --> 35:43.692
Wait. You want them
in the same house?

35:43.792 --> 35:45.442
Yeah, she's gotta be
the key to saving him,

35:45.542 --> 35:47.899
otherwise why would Kellman
want Tom to kill her?

35:47.999 --> 35:49.942
Okay, uh, well, maybe
I can figure out a way

35:50.042 --> 35:52.567
to tweak the lost-and-found
spell again...

35:52.667 --> 35:53.776
lure him
to the house,

35:53.876 --> 35:55.818
and after all,
Tom's a lost soul, right?

35:55.918 --> 35:57.859
Is she gonna be okay?

35:57.959 --> 36:00.567
Yeah. Go. I'll take of Piper.

36:00.667 --> 36:01.317
You sure?

36:01.417 --> 36:02.876
Yeah.

36:08.626 --> 36:10.609
Prue, maybe we should
talk about this first.

36:10.709 --> 36:11.692
Yeah, we'll have
to figure out

36:11.792 --> 36:13.401
how to take out
Kellman on the way.

36:13.501 --> 36:14.150
That's not what I mean.

36:14.250 --> 36:15.899
Now is not really
the time, Phoebe.

36:15.999 --> 36:18.317
Prue, what if we
don't have any other time?

36:18.417 --> 36:21.317
Look, we may not
be able to defeat Kellman.

36:21.417 --> 36:22.442
We could lose.

36:22.542 --> 36:23.150
We won't lose.

36:23.250 --> 36:24.526
How do you
know that, Prue?

36:24.626 --> 36:25.899
All you want
to do is save Tom,

36:25.999 --> 36:26.942
which is all I wanted
to do for Cole.

36:27.042 --> 36:30.067
Okay, Phoebe, don't try and turn
this around on me, all right?

36:30.167 --> 36:32.150
I'm not the one who
kept secrets from you.

36:32.250 --> 36:33.983
Prue, I didn't tell you
because I knew

36:34.083 --> 36:35.234
you wouldn't understand.

36:35.334 --> 36:35.899
You hated Cole.

36:35.999 --> 36:38.526
No, I didn't trust
him, and I was right.

36:38.626 --> 36:39.900
You never gave him a chance.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.067
He didn't deserve a chance.

36:41.167 --> 36:43.983
Oh, and what makes Tom
deserve a chance?

36:44.083 --> 36:44.983
Because he started out good.

36:45.083 --> 36:46.899
He didn't start out
trying to kill us.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.999
Can we talk about this later?

37:00.083 --> 37:01.067
Hey.

37:01.167 --> 37:02.651
(<i>moans</i>)

37:02.751 --> 37:04.025
Guess what.

37:04.125 --> 37:05.959
I found mom's ring.

37:07.292 --> 37:09.999
(<i>groaning</i>)

37:26.542 --> 37:27.120
DARRYL:
Mrs. Peters?

37:27.130 --> 37:30.317
Inspector Morris,
San Francisco PD.

37:30.417 --> 37:32.209
Tom?

37:38.792 --> 37:41.292
(<i>dog growling</i>)

37:52.709 --> 37:53.401
What was that?

37:53.501 --> 37:54.609
What are those noises?

37:54.709 --> 37:56.999
I'm not quite sure.

37:59.999 --> 38:01.776
Thanks for coming,
Mrs. Peters.

38:01.876 --> 38:02.734
But I don't understand.

38:02.834 --> 38:03.704
You will soon.
Any sign of Kellman?

38:03.714 --> 38:06.317
No, but there are
plenty of other signs.

38:06.417 --> 38:07.899
(<i>dog barking</i>)

38:07.999 --> 38:08.204
Uh-oh.

38:08.214 --> 38:10.900
Seems like some
lost souls were found.

38:11.000 --> 38:11.900
Yeah, we need

38:12.000 --> 38:13.609
to reverse
the spell quick.

38:13.709 --> 38:14.876
Where's Tom?

38:20.083 --> 38:21.542
Tom!

38:22.417 --> 38:23.292
No. No.

38:23.667 --> 38:24.234
How did you...?

38:24.334 --> 38:25.776
'Cause we're not
done with you yet.

38:25.876 --> 38:28.983
I told you it was
too late to save Tom.

38:29.083 --> 38:33.000
But thank you
for leading us to the victim.

38:33.334 --> 38:33.900
(<i>gasps</i>)

38:34.000 --> 38:35.918
Kill her, Tom.

38:42.459 --> 38:42.942
All right, Tom.

38:43.042 --> 38:44.899
Listen to me.
Look at your mother.

38:44.999 --> 38:46.192
All right, remember

38:46.292 --> 38:47.275
what it felt
like to be human.

38:47.375 --> 38:50.083
Remember what it feels
like to be loved.

38:57.876 --> 38:58.942
Prue, we're about to have

38:59.042 --> 39:01.359
other problems
from other worlds.

39:01.459 --> 39:02.567
MRS. PETERS:
Tom?

39:02.667 --> 39:04.209
Help me.

39:05.083 --> 39:06.375
Kill her, damn it!

39:33.375 --> 39:34.484
What the hell is happening?

39:34.584 --> 39:35.526
I think there's some lost souls

39:35.626 --> 39:37.899
welcoming their
new friend. Get rid of 'em!

39:37.999 --> 39:40.776
(<i>moaning</i>)

39:40.876 --> 39:43.859
I return what
I didn't want to find.

39:43.959 --> 39:46.234
Let it be out
of sight, out of mind.

39:46.334 --> 39:49.876
(<i>babbling cacophony
 of voices</i>)

39:56.999 --> 39:59.375
(<i>gasps</i>)

40:10.292 --> 40:12.292
Mom?

40:12.999 --> 40:14.275
Mom, I'm so sorry.

40:14.375 --> 40:16.359
Oh. Oh, Tommy. It's all right.

40:16.459 --> 40:18.234
Everything's all right.

40:18.334 --> 40:20.999
Oh... Oh...

40:22.250 --> 40:26.292
I guess some guys <i>are
</i> worth saving after all.

40:32.999 --> 40:35.150
PIPER:
Isn't that beautiful?

40:35.250 --> 40:35.899
PRUE:
Mm-hmm.

40:35.999 --> 40:37.983
Yes, and it's right
where it belongs.

40:38.083 --> 40:40.776
So is Tom, by the way,
at home with his mom.

40:40.876 --> 40:43.818
And I got Rasputin back to
the family he was living with.

40:43.918 --> 40:46.234
So maybe the spell wasn't
such a bad thing after all.

40:46.334 --> 40:49.025
Are you kidding? We're gonna
have to have huge garage sales

40:49.125 --> 40:51.109
every Saturday for, like,
the next three months

40:51.209 --> 40:53.899
to get rid of all
the stuff that
came back here.

40:53.999 --> 40:55.484
Yeah, who knows what trouble
may be caused

40:55.584 --> 40:57.150
if those lost souls
had stayed around?

40:57.250 --> 40:58.567
Okay, okay, I will fix it.

40:58.667 --> 41:01.501
You guys go and
have a nice dinner.

41:17.792 --> 41:20.192
So now everything's
back to normal.

41:20.292 --> 41:21.899
What about your hair?

41:21.999 --> 41:24.275
Mmm... I'm tempted
to keep it, but...

41:24.375 --> 41:27.442
I don't know. I think
the blond's coming back.

41:27.542 --> 41:30.417
Is anything else?

41:31.042 --> 41:32.542
No.

41:35.834 --> 41:38.542
You were right about Tom.

41:39.375 --> 41:42.899
And I was wrong
about Cole.

41:42.999 --> 41:44.359
I'm sorry.

41:44.459 --> 41:47.150
And you think that
just takes care of it?

41:47.250 --> 41:47.899
"I'm sorry"?

41:47.999 --> 41:52.899
No, well, obviously
an apology doesn't fix it,

41:52.999 --> 41:54.275
but I'm not stupid, Prue.

41:54.375 --> 41:56.401
I know that I made a bad choice.

41:56.501 --> 41:59.501
A choice that betrayed us.

42:00.584 --> 42:04.442
I didn't do it
to betray you, Prue.

42:04.542 --> 42:06.542
I did it out of love.

42:07.876 --> 42:08.275
Right.

42:08.375 --> 42:12.899
Love. Love that almost
got all of us killed.

42:12.999 --> 42:18.667
You wanted to save Tom after...
I don't know, how many years?

42:19.083 --> 42:22.999
Why can't you understand
how I felt about Cole?

42:23.584 --> 42:25.567
Phoebe, what I don't understand

42:25.667 --> 42:28.542
is how you could
have lied to us.

42:29.250 --> 42:30.025
Piper and me.

42:30.125 --> 42:31.317
A lie that still poses

42:31.417 --> 42:33.792
a threat to all three of us.

42:38.167 --> 42:41.167
Where do I go from here?

42:42.083 --> 42:44.125
I don't know.
