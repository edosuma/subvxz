WEBVTT

00:03.291 --> 00:07.411
Your Majesty,
I have your morning tea.

00:07.411 --> 00:09.161
Your Majesty?

00:09.161 --> 00:11.621
Queen Eclipsa?

00:11.621 --> 00:15.581
[gasps]

00:15.581 --> 00:18.461
[wailing]

00:18.461 --> 00:21.121
Oh, no.
This is bad.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.331
This is really,
really bad.

00:23.331 --> 00:26.121
Who's even powerful enough
to queen-nap Eclipsa?

00:26.121 --> 00:29.371
I don't know! The magical
high commission, maybe?

00:29.371 --> 00:31.121
-Or, uh...
-[door opens]

00:31.121 --> 00:33.121
It's just the mail!
Please don't hurt me!

00:33.121 --> 00:34.791
We'll see about that.

00:34.791 --> 00:37.751
Oh! Maybe the queen-nappers
left us a message?

00:37.751 --> 00:39.751
Junk, junk.
Hey, a bill from Seahorse.

00:39.751 --> 00:43.911
Well, all that stuff
you vanished on my show
was not free.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.581
All right. Looks like
this is a dead end.

00:45.581 --> 00:47.871
Don't worry, B-fly,
I got you.

00:47.871 --> 00:50.581
I watch a lot of
true-crime shows, so I'm
basically a detective.

00:50.581 --> 00:53.701
Ooh, we're gonna gather clues
and probably chase people down.

00:53.701 --> 00:56.121
And, oh! We'll have
a super dramatic showdown

00:56.121 --> 00:59.461
in, like, an old warehouse
or something like--

00:59.461 --> 01:02.081
-No, we don't
have time for that.
-Oh, okay. Well, fine, then.

01:02.081 --> 01:03.791
That's fine, if you want
to be basic about it.

01:05.661 --> 01:07.621
-[gasps]
-Whoa.

01:07.621 --> 01:09.961
That's the creepiest thing
I've ever seen.

01:09.961 --> 01:13.411
-[camera whirrs]
-Okay, okay. Where are you?

01:13.411 --> 01:15.081
Who dares to spy on us?

01:15.081 --> 01:17.621
Aah! Who are you,
and what do you want?

01:17.621 --> 01:19.661
We are the inner circle.

01:19.661 --> 01:23.251
We require
one thousand pounds
of gold

01:23.251 --> 01:25.251
before midnight!

01:25.251 --> 01:28.001
If you ever want to see
your queen again.

01:28.001 --> 01:30.411
-Oh, yeah? Well, I--
-Silence!

01:30.411 --> 01:32.661
If you keep using that
infernal spying spell,

01:32.661 --> 01:34.661
we'll toss your queen
into the fire!

01:34.661 --> 01:37.831
Now, close this portal
and get that gold!

01:37.831 --> 01:41.791
Okay, well, let's keep this
under wraps for now.

01:41.791 --> 01:43.791
If the townsfolk
find out about this,

01:43.791 --> 01:45.791
we could have a serious
panic on our hands.

01:45.791 --> 01:47.831
Right, right, right.
But what if,

01:47.831 --> 01:51.041
let's just say maybe,
hypothetically,
they already know?

01:51.041 --> 01:54.081
-What? How?
-Status update.

01:54.871 --> 01:56.661
Oh, right.

01:56.661 --> 01:59.001
Then I guess we'd better
make an announcement.

01:59.001 --> 02:01.661
Thank you, everyone,
for coming.

02:01.661 --> 02:04.501
First, I would like
to announce that, yes,

02:04.501 --> 02:06.831
the rumors are
technically true.

02:06.831 --> 02:09.831
Queen Eclipsa
has been queen-napped.

02:09.831 --> 02:12.201
-[whispering]
-[man] Who's Queen Eclipsa?

02:12.201 --> 02:14.831
But don't worry.
We are going to find Eclipsa

02:14.831 --> 02:17.411
and bring her back safely.

02:17.411 --> 02:19.621
Yeah, I have a question.

02:19.621 --> 02:21.501
How bad should I feel
about this?

02:21.501 --> 02:23.871
Because I do not
feel bad right now.

02:23.871 --> 02:26.911
-Yeah, who even likes Eclipsa?
-Not me.

02:26.911 --> 02:29.041
Uh, but, uh...

02:29.041 --> 02:31.911
-But if we don't find her
in three hours, she's gonna die!
-[all gasp]

02:31.911 --> 02:34.081
Pony, what is wrong with you!
Why would you say that.

02:34.081 --> 02:37.331
We need to keep the stakes
really high to get people
invested.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.501
Why do you think I'm posting
updates every five minutes?

02:39.501 --> 02:41.831
-I'm keeping it fresh.
-[groans]

02:41.831 --> 02:44.041
Why don't we go to that park
where all the hot bad boys

02:44.041 --> 02:46.331
in leather jackets
hang out with each other,
you know what I mean?

02:46.331 --> 02:49.001
-I bet they can
hook us up with some clues.
-No need, my dudes.

02:49.001 --> 02:51.541
I've got our first clue
right here.

02:56.411 --> 02:58.541
All right,
anyone see anything yet?

02:58.541 --> 03:01.001
No, because this is a stupid
waste of time, okay?

03:01.001 --> 03:03.121
Janna just wanted us
to go to the Underworld.

03:03.121 --> 03:05.461
Uh, no. We came here
because these fires

03:05.461 --> 03:08.961
look just like the ones
we saw in the All Seeing Eye.

03:08.961 --> 03:10.291
Not that I mind the view.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.581
Yeah, well, there are no
hot bad boys here,

03:12.581 --> 03:14.621
so I don't know what
I'm supposed to take a photo of.

03:14.621 --> 03:16.581
Yo, Earth turd, look cool!

03:16.581 --> 03:19.751
-Huh? [exclaims]
-Hmm, okay.

03:19.751 --> 03:22.331
So maybe this was not
a complete waste of time.

03:22.331 --> 03:25.751
Guys, I think
I just got a message
from our queen-nappers.

03:25.751 --> 03:27.911
[Marco] Wait, that doesn't
look like the Underworld.

03:27.911 --> 03:30.081
-Where did the fire go?
-I don't know.

03:30.081 --> 03:32.751
[gasps]
Maybe they changed locations
after I spied on them.

03:32.751 --> 03:34.871
[reading text]

03:36.871 --> 03:38.961
-That must be...
-A graveyard!

03:38.961 --> 03:40.911
A mattress store!

03:40.911 --> 03:43.291
What?
That's an option too.

03:44.751 --> 03:48.121
Okay, yes!
A spooky graveyard,
a full moon.

03:48.121 --> 03:51.001
This is the cool
detective stuff
I signed up for.

03:51.001 --> 03:54.001
We're not trying to be
cool detectives, Pony.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.581
-This is serious.
-[both gasp]

03:57.871 --> 03:59.961
Hey, come back here!

03:59.961 --> 04:03.461
Ooh, a graveyard chase!
I am so live-streaming this!

04:03.461 --> 04:06.371
Rainbow avalanche!

04:06.371 --> 04:09.001
I got this!
[shouts]

04:09.001 --> 04:11.041
Who sent you?

04:11.041 --> 04:12.791
Wait!
Hold that pose!

04:12.791 --> 04:14.831
We're kind of in the middle
of something here.

04:14.831 --> 04:16.791
Documentation
is important, okay?

04:16.791 --> 04:19.121
So do that pose again like
you're gonna chop his head off.

04:19.121 --> 04:20.961
And now move
your arm up.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.961
-Now make that
super growly face.
-Pony...

04:22.961 --> 04:25.661
-Just do it!
-[growls]

04:25.661 --> 04:27.831
Yes!
Work it, Princess!

04:27.831 --> 04:30.411
Thank you, Earth turd.
You may proceed.

04:30.411 --> 04:32.501
Now, who are you--

04:32.501 --> 04:36.911
-Babs?
-[coughing] Sorry. Bronchitis.

04:36.911 --> 04:39.831
Who sent you?
Why were you trying
to assassinate us?

04:39.831 --> 04:43.251
The Assassin's Guild
doesn't just do
assassinations.

04:43.251 --> 04:44.961
We also do spying,

04:44.961 --> 04:47.411
death threats,
ransom arrows...

04:47.411 --> 04:49.201
Oh, you mean like this?

04:49.201 --> 04:50.961
[reading]

04:52.791 --> 04:55.041
Well, that's definitely
not the graveyard.

04:55.041 --> 04:57.961
Ugh! How are they always
one step ahead of us?

05:01.541 --> 05:03.331
I don't know
about this, Star.

05:03.331 --> 05:06.411
Why would the Merpeople
have a shark in a tank?

05:06.411 --> 05:09.661
Pony, The shark isn't
in the tank, Eclipsa is.

05:09.661 --> 05:11.961
That sounds like
kind of a stretch to me.

05:11.961 --> 05:13.911
It was all I could
think of, okay?

05:13.911 --> 05:16.081
Right now
it's our best bet
to finding Eclipsa.

05:16.081 --> 05:19.621
-Eclipsa? Is she okay?
-Have you found her yet?

05:19.621 --> 05:22.411
No, not yet. We're still
investigating some leads.

05:22.411 --> 05:25.121
Well, don't give up.
We're rooting for you.

05:25.121 --> 05:28.201
I mean,
don't get me wrong,
I still hate Eclipsa.

05:28.201 --> 05:31.121
But I'm kinda invested
in the story at this point.

05:31.121 --> 05:34.621
Yeah, Pony.
Your live-stream
is super addicting.

05:34.621 --> 05:36.621
My whole life
is very addicting.

05:36.621 --> 05:39.331
Pony, you can't just
broadcast our every move
to the whole world.

05:39.331 --> 05:41.961
That's probably
how the queen-nappers
keep outsmarting us.

05:41.961 --> 05:43.871
I'm just giving the people
what they want.

05:43.871 --> 05:46.201
[seething]

05:46.201 --> 05:48.751
[blows note]

05:51.081 --> 05:53.291
You summoned me,
Miss Butterfly?

05:53.291 --> 05:56.411
Larry Kelpbottom!
Just the fish-man
I wanted to see.

05:56.411 --> 05:59.831
I'm on to your little tricks.
Where are you hiding her?

05:59.831 --> 06:02.371
-Hiding who?
-Oh, don't play dumb.

06:02.371 --> 06:05.081
Your family never liked
Eclipsa, did they?

06:05.081 --> 06:08.121
-Wh-What?
-It has to be you.

06:08.121 --> 06:10.331
'Cause if it's not you,

06:10.331 --> 06:13.041
I don't know
what to do anymore.

06:13.041 --> 06:14.911
Are you okay?

06:14.911 --> 06:17.831
Whoa. Star is
losing it!

06:17.831 --> 06:20.201
Oh, boy, boy, boy, boy.
You need to dial it back, girl.

06:20.201 --> 06:23.001
You can't lose
your head over this.
Look at yourself!

06:23.001 --> 06:25.121
This isn't who you are!

06:25.121 --> 06:26.961
Eh, you're right, Pony.

06:26.961 --> 06:29.791
I can't just lose...
Wait a minute.

06:29.791 --> 06:32.661
"I watch you from the water,
but I never get..."

06:32.661 --> 06:35.041
[exclaims]
I was wrong!

06:35.041 --> 06:38.041
[gasps] Sorry, dude!
Guys, I figured out the riddle.

06:38.041 --> 06:40.831
The answer isn't the Merpeople,
it's your reflection.

06:40.831 --> 06:44.751
So Eclipsa is trapped
in a mirror!

06:44.751 --> 06:46.291
No.

06:47.701 --> 06:49.541
-So where are we going?
-Here.

06:49.541 --> 06:52.161
It's the bill
from Reflectacorp.
Tally it up.

06:52.161 --> 06:55.161
It's a thousand pounds
of gold. That's...

06:55.161 --> 06:57.871
The exact same amount
as the demand!

06:57.871 --> 07:00.331
Uh-huh. Seahorse.
He's the queen-napper.

07:00.331 --> 07:02.751
Reflection. Reflectacorp.
This has to be it!

07:02.751 --> 07:05.001
How could Seahorse
do such a thing?

07:05.001 --> 07:08.041
I mean, he did say
that he was in trouble
with Reflectacorp

07:08.041 --> 07:10.041
because of all the equipment
that we destroyed.

07:10.041 --> 07:12.371
I don't know.
This is still weird.

07:12.371 --> 07:14.751
If he wants the gold,
why send all these clues

07:14.751 --> 07:17.041
-leading us right to Eclipsa?
-[Star] There it is!

07:17.041 --> 07:20.001
The abandoned
Reflectacorp warehouse.

07:21.871 --> 07:24.911
[all shout, gasp]

07:24.911 --> 07:28.121
I must get out!

07:28.121 --> 07:29.371
[all] Eclipsa!

07:29.371 --> 07:31.161
Don't worry, Eclipsa.

07:31.161 --> 07:33.251
We will get you
out of this thing.

07:33.251 --> 07:36.541
-[grunting]
-[gasps] No!

07:36.541 --> 07:39.791
I almost had
all 300 Snarlblecks!

07:39.791 --> 07:43.041
-What?
-[Seahorse] Uh-oh.
You seem confused.

07:43.041 --> 07:46.371
How about some help
from your local Reflectacorp
service provider?

07:46.371 --> 07:49.541
What you have there is
Reflectacorp's first foray

07:49.541 --> 07:51.661
into biotech
virtual reality.

07:51.661 --> 07:54.331
Eclipsa has been playing
one of our hit games,

07:54.331 --> 07:56.871
-Wizard Spaceship!
-[game beeping]

07:56.871 --> 07:59.501
So this whole time,
Eclipsa has just been

07:59.501 --> 08:01.961
sitting here
playing video games?

08:01.961 --> 08:03.251
That is correct.

08:03.251 --> 08:06.121
What about those fire pits?
And that shark tank?

08:06.121 --> 08:07.961
So glad you asked!

08:07.961 --> 08:10.541
Those stunning, hi-def
environments were created

08:10.541 --> 08:13.121
using Reflectacorp's
patented four-wall
projector.

08:13.121 --> 08:15.541
Optional floor
and ceiling units
sold separately.

08:15.541 --> 08:17.501
What about the Inner Circle?

08:17.501 --> 08:19.251
Are they fake too?

08:19.251 --> 08:22.701
Oh, we're very much real.

08:22.701 --> 08:24.661
[sinister laughter]

08:24.661 --> 08:27.541
[all] Ta-da!

08:27.541 --> 08:29.411
Pony Sisters?
Okay, wait.

08:29.411 --> 08:32.201
If you're in on this
and Seahorse is in on this...

08:32.201 --> 08:34.331
[gasps] Oh, no.

08:34.331 --> 08:37.501
Oh, ye-e-e-s-s!

08:37.501 --> 08:41.661
Ponyhead?
You are behind all this?
What-- How could you?

08:41.661 --> 08:43.461
Wow! Ungrateful much?

08:43.461 --> 08:45.961
We put a lot of work
into those riddles, you know.

08:45.961 --> 08:49.081
And of course
there would have been
way cleverer riddles

08:49.081 --> 08:52.331
if we started at the park
with the hot boys in their
leather jackets, okay?

08:52.331 --> 08:55.251
But no, no one wanted
to listen to me, so...
[blows raspberry]

08:55.251 --> 08:58.331
But why? You sent us
on an emotional
roller coaster,

08:58.331 --> 09:01.041
and you could have caused
a riot on Mewni!

09:01.041 --> 09:04.621
What? I was just
keeping my promise to make
Eclipsa super-popular.

09:04.621 --> 09:08.081
And the new queen-napping
segment is totally
blowing up right now.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.701
-Segment?
-That's right, girl!
[chuckles]

09:10.701 --> 09:12.041
Seahorse, hit it!

09:14.081 --> 09:17.501
-Aah!
-Because you're still on...

09:17.501 --> 09:20.041
[reality show theme plays]

09:20.041 --> 09:23.251
The Ponyhead Show!

09:23.251 --> 09:25.411
What?

09:25.411 --> 09:27.911
Hi, Pony fans!

09:27.911 --> 09:29.871
As you can see,
I, Ponyhead,

09:29.871 --> 09:33.161
used my super good
detective skills
to track down Eclipsa!

09:33.161 --> 09:35.751
Girl, how's it feel
to be rescued by me?

09:35.751 --> 09:38.041
-What?
-[chuckles] I know, right?

09:38.041 --> 09:40.291
Then those evil
queen-napper guys

09:40.291 --> 09:42.291
tried to ambush us,
so I beat them up,

09:42.291 --> 09:44.331
and now they're
going to jail!

09:44.331 --> 09:47.461
-Like for real, though.
-We never discussed this!

09:47.461 --> 09:51.201
Oh, and Star was there too.
Smile for the camera, Star.

09:51.201 --> 09:53.461
Pony, Who is this even for?

09:53.461 --> 09:55.871
Our loyal
content subscribers.

09:55.871 --> 09:58.331
They're watching the live feed
on their Reflectacorp
mirror phones.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.121
Whoa, there's Eclipsa!

10:00.121 --> 10:02.161
She's okay!

10:02.161 --> 10:04.161
Hey, Eclipsa's been rescued!

10:04.161 --> 10:06.161
How did everyone
find out about this?

10:06.161 --> 10:08.161
From my updates,
B-fly.

10:08.161 --> 10:09.791
The Mewmans may hate Eclipsa,

10:09.791 --> 10:12.411
but there is no problem
a good drama can't fix.

10:12.411 --> 10:14.331
-[cheering]
-No one messes with our queen!

10:14.331 --> 10:17.291
There she is!
Hey, Eclipsa!

10:17.291 --> 10:19.501
-I love you!
-I love you, Eclipsa!

10:19.501 --> 10:21.331
Well, Ponyhead,

10:21.331 --> 10:23.961
that was a totally
awful thing to do.

10:23.961 --> 10:27.121
But you did somehow
end up helping Eclipsa,

10:27.121 --> 10:29.331
so I can't really
hold it against you.

10:29.331 --> 10:31.961
Yeah! No consequences
for Ponyhead!

10:31.961 --> 10:35.161
And at least
I don't have to pay
that huge Reflectacorp bill.

10:35.161 --> 10:37.791
Okay, no.
That part was real.

10:37.791 --> 10:41.161
You have to pay that,
or they'll find you.
