00:03.674 --> 00:05.706
(Meredith)
THE SURGICAL SCALPEL

00:05.706 --> 00:08.109
IS MADE OF STERILIZED,
CARBONIZED

00:08.109 --> 00:10.311
STAINLESS STEEL.

00:10.311 --> 00:13.384
THIS IS A VAST IMPROVEMENT
OVER THE FIRST SCALPEL,

00:13.384 --> 00:15.486
WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH
A SHARP STICK.

00:15.486 --> 00:18.089
MEDICINE IS CONSTANTLY
REINVENTING ITSELF.

00:18.089 --> 00:19.590
THAT MEANS SURGEONS

00:19.590 --> 00:21.592
HAVE TO KEEP REINVENTING
THEMSELVES, TOO.

00:21.592 --> 00:24.595
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE DOING THIS.
(Owen and Derek)
IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY.

00:24.595 --> 00:27.098
(Meredith and Cristina)
WE DON'T DO VALENTINE'S DAY.

00:27.098 --> 00:29.230
THERE'S MORE TO LIFE
THAN THE HOSPITAL.
NO, THERE ISN'T.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.801
IT'S ROMANTIC.

00:30.801 --> 00:32.733
NO, IT ISN'T.
(siren wailing)

00:32.733 --> 00:35.236
THERE'S CONSTANT PRESSURE
TO ADAPT TO CHANGES.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.767
AMBULANCE!

00:36.767 --> 00:40.071
IT CAN BE A PAINFUL PROCESS.
EYES FRONT, LADIES.

00:40.071 --> 00:42.042
BUT WITHOUT IT...

00:42.042 --> 00:46.077
(sirens wailing,
horns honking)

00:46.077 --> 00:48.179
OKAY, THAT SEEMED BIG.

00:48.179 --> 00:50.451
IF IT'S BIG,
THEY'LL PAGE US.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.083
(pagers beeping)

00:52.083 --> 00:54.355
IT'S BIG.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.387
YES!
(laughs)

00:56.387 --> 00:59.090
YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF
MOVING BACKWARDS

00:59.090 --> 01:06.797
INSTEAD OF FORWARDS.

01:06.797 --> 01:08.839
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
GRANDINETTI'S ROOF COLLAPSED.

01:08.839 --> 01:10.841
WE'LL BE GETTING
MORE THAN A DOZEN.

01:10.841 --> 01:13.344
ALL SCHEDULED PROCEDURES
ARE PUSHED.
UGH. ON VALENTINE'S DAY?

01:13.344 --> 01:15.346
GOD, GRANDINETTI'S
MUST HAVE BEEN PACKED.

01:15.346 --> 01:17.848
WELL, TONIGHT'S OUT.
I TOLD YOU THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

01:17.848 --> 01:20.351
WELL, THAT'S WHY WE WENT
TO DINNER AT 4:00

01:20.351 --> 01:22.313
AND EXCHANGED GIFTS.
LOOK.
(laughs)

01:22.313 --> 01:24.585
JUST SPECIAL.
ORIGINAL. MAGICAL.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.688
SQUEALS OF JOY.
WOW. SCROOGE.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.820
SCROOGE IS CHRISTMAS.
THAT'S A HOLIDAY.

01:29.820 --> 01:32.693
(Ben) DR. BAILEY.
OUR HEMICOLECTOMY'S PUSHED.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.696
THAT'S A SHAME. I WAS--I WAS
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.198
WELL, AS... YOU KNOW....

01:37.198 --> 01:39.200
WELL, MAYBE WE COULD
MAKE UP FOR IT.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.831
DINNER TOMORROW?
NO.

01:40.831 --> 01:42.773
UM... (stammers)
JUST...

01:42.773 --> 01:44.375
I'M... BUSY.

01:44.375 --> 01:46.477
I HAVE SURGERIES MOST NIGHTS.

01:46.477 --> 01:48.179
I ALWAYS HAVE SURGERY.

01:48.179 --> 01:52.143
RIGHT. WELL, UM, MAYBE
SEE YOU IN THE O.R., THEN.

01:54.185 --> 01:57.648
(elevator bell dings)

01:57.648 --> 01:58.819

01:58.819 --> 02:00.391
(exhales deeply)

02:00.391 --> 02:02.153
(clears throat)

02:02.153 --> 02:04.555
OH, MY GOD.
SHE LIKES HIM.

02:04.555 --> 02:06.357
(floor indicator bell dings)

02:06.357 --> 02:09.360
OOH, YOU LIKE HIM?
OH, MY GOD. YOU SHOULD
TOTALLY GO OUT WITH HIM.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.363
YOU HAVE TO SAY YES.
OH, NO. IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY.
YOU HAVE TO.

02:12.363 --> 02:14.365
OKAY, SEE, THAT--
THIS RIGHT HERE,

02:14.365 --> 02:16.267
WHAT'S HAPPENING,
THE GIGGLING...

02:16.267 --> 02:19.270
(ding)
THE GIRL TALK, THE O.M.G.s--
OKAY, IT HAS TO STOP.

02:19.270 --> 02:21.542
(giggles)
I AM BUSY.

02:24.175 --> 02:26.547
(laughs)
(elevator bell dings)

02:26.547 --> 02:28.519
(Mark) HEY, TORRES.

02:28.519 --> 02:31.222
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT PUTTING TOGETHER CRIBS?

02:31.222 --> 02:32.523
YOU BOUGHT A CRIB?

02:32.523 --> 02:34.225
WELL, SLOAN'S COMING HOME
TONIGHT,

02:34.225 --> 02:36.227
AND I GOT IT PUT TOGETHER,
BUT IT WOBBLES.

02:36.227 --> 02:37.528
AND IT CAN'T WOBBLE.

02:37.528 --> 02:39.530
NOW WILL YOU TAKE
A LOOK AT IT?

02:39.530 --> 02:41.532
(laughs) YOU'RE LIKE
A SWEET, NERDY DAD NOW.

02:41.532 --> 02:43.364
I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE YOU.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.366
WELL...
WHO'S THE BLONDE?

02:45.366 --> 02:46.897
I DON'T KNOW.

02:46.897 --> 02:50.201
I MAY BE A DAD,
BUT I AM A SINGLE DAD.

02:50.201 --> 02:52.703
EXCUSE ME.

02:52.703 --> 02:56.247
(chuckles) OKAY.
NOW--NOW I RECOGNIZE YOU.

02:56.247 --> 02:57.778
IT MUST, UH,

02:57.778 --> 02:59.950
SUCK TO WORK
ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

02:59.950 --> 03:01.912
I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET.

03:01.912 --> 03:05.216
AAH!
WHAT'D YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR?!

03:05.216 --> 03:08.259
I CHANGED IT.
I-I COLORED IT.

03:08.259 --> 03:09.520
I JUST...

03:09.520 --> 03:12.423
WAIT. YOU THOUGHT
I WAS SOMEONE ELSE.

03:12.423 --> 03:15.626
YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ME
AND YOU WERE HITTING ON ME?
NO, NO.

03:15.626 --> 03:18.969
I PRETTY MUCH THOUGHT YOU WERE,
YOU KNOW, JUST SOME BLONDE.

03:18.969 --> 03:21.932
YOU ARE PATHETIC
AND HYPOCRITICAL

03:21.932 --> 03:23.804
AND SLUTTY.
AND YOU ARE NO BLONDE.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.206
YOU CAN'T PULL THAT OFF.
(scoffs)

03:26.206 --> 03:28.639
BLONDES ARE EITHER BADASS
OR FUN.

03:28.639 --> 03:31.382
AND YOU'RE...
YOU'RE A BRUNETTE.

03:31.382 --> 03:34.385
(siren wailing)

03:34.385 --> 03:35.886
DAMN.

03:35.886 --> 03:37.388
SHUT UP!

03:46.557 --> 03:50.401
QUIT STARING. I'M PROBABLY
GONNA CHANGE IT BACK ANYWAY.
NO, I-I GET IT.

03:50.401 --> 03:52.403
YOU GET DUMPED
BY YOUR BOYFRIEND,

03:52.403 --> 03:54.465
AND YOU GO FOR
THE EXTREME MAKEOVER.

03:54.465 --> 03:56.467
CHICKS ALWAYS DO THAT.
I DIDN'T GET DUMPED. OKAY?

03:56.467 --> 03:58.909
AND I DID NOT DO THIS
FOR MARK. I JUST...

03:58.909 --> 04:01.972
IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY, AND I
WANTED TO CHANGE SOMETHING.

04:01.972 --> 04:03.844
AND--AND I COULD CHANGE--

04:03.844 --> 04:06.417
I-I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
FOR ME, OKAY?

04:06.417 --> 04:10.281
THIS WAS FOR ME.
HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT I JUST SAID?

04:12.853 --> 04:14.885
I'M CHANGING IT BACK.

04:14.885 --> 04:16.887
(indistinct shouting)

04:16.887 --> 04:19.029
(man) TRAUMA 2's AVAILABLE.
THIS IS MEDIC 16...

04:19.029 --> 04:20.891
RESTAURANT ROOF COLLAPSE.
OOH.

04:20.891 --> 04:22.893
YEAH, SO FAR--A PENETRATING
ABDOMINAL INJURY,

04:22.893 --> 04:25.536
A SUCKING CHEST WOUND
AND A MASSIVE HEAD WOUND.

04:25.536 --> 04:28.038
ALSO, THERE'S AN OPEN FRACTURE
ON THE WAY. DO YOU WANT ME--
DR. SHEPHERD.

04:28.038 --> 04:30.040
OH, YOU'RE STILL HERE?
IF YOU'RE HERE, I'M HERE.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.042
THERE'S AN OSHA INVESTIGATOR
WAITING IN THE LOBBY,

04:32.042 --> 04:34.905
AND THERE'S ALSO TWO TV CREWS
WHO ARE ASKING FOR A STATEMENT.

04:34.905 --> 04:37.478
I TOLD 'EM TO WAIT FOR YOU.
THEY'RE SETTING UP OUTSIDE.
WE CLEARED THE O.R. BOARD,

04:37.478 --> 04:40.280
ALSO, I PAGED BAILEY, NELSON,
ALTMAN, HAGAN AND SLOAN.
AS SOON AS I HAVE
ALL OF THE NUMBERS, I'LL--

04:40.280 --> 04:42.413
DO YOU WANT TO GET
ANYBODY ELSE?
STOP. WHO DO I SEE FIRST?

04:42.413 --> 04:44.415
SKULL FRACTURE, TRAUMA 1.
THE OSHA GUY.

04:44.415 --> 04:46.587
CHART, PLEASE.
(Owen) TRY TO GET
AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE

04:46.587 --> 04:48.288
OFF THE BACKBOARDS.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.590
CLEAR C-SPINES CLINICALLY,

04:49.590 --> 04:51.792
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT SURE,
WAIT FOR X-RAY

04:51.792 --> 04:54.294
NO MATTER HOW BACKED UP
THEY ARE.
HEY, HOLD THE ELEVATOR.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.066
(woman) I GOT IT!
(man) TRAUMA 4 IS OPEN.

04:56.066 --> 04:58.068
OKAY, UH, BRING THE CHART,
PLEASE.
RIGHT AWAY.

04:58.068 --> 05:01.502
WHERE ARE THEY TAKING
MY HUSBAND?
UH, HE'S GOING INTO SURGERY.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.774
HIS DOCTORS WILL
LET US KNOW MORE SOON.

05:03.774 --> 05:06.036
CAN YOU TAKE A DEEP BREATH
FOR ME, PLEASE?
WHAT DO YOU HAVE, GREY?

05:06.036 --> 05:08.078
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS
ON THE LEFT SIDE.

05:08.078 --> 05:11.011
POSSIBLY A PNEUMOTHORAX.
ALL RIGHT, PUT IN A CHEST TUBE
IF YOU NEED TO.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.083
EVALUATE AND PAGE ME
IF IT'S SURGICAL. OH!
OH!

05:13.083 --> 05:15.686
SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

05:15.686 --> 05:17.087
(sirens wailing,
horns honking)

05:17.087 --> 05:19.019
(man) NONRESPONSIVE--
OKAY, LET ME SEE THE CHART.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.021
LOOKS LIKE
A PRETTY BAD BREAK.

05:21.021 --> 05:24.455
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO HAVE THAT RESET.
I WONDER
IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE

05:24.455 --> 05:26.927
YOU COULD PUT ME IN A BED
NEXT TO THAT LADY?

05:26.927 --> 05:30.000
(chuckles) YEAH, SORRY.
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.604
OF COURSE. FORGIVE ME.

05:33.604 --> 05:36.967
I'VE BEEN A HEAD WAITER
FOR 25 YEARS.

05:36.967 --> 05:38.839
I KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.611
(elevator bell dings)

05:40.611 --> 05:42.973
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

05:42.973 --> 05:45.476
IT'S A DEPRESSED SKULL FRACTURE
WITH A SUBDURAL HEMATOMA.

05:45.476 --> 05:47.648
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S BOOK AN O.R.
CHIEF.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.620
YEAH.
I NEED YOU TO REASSIGN
SOME ANESTHESIOLOGISTS.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.622
YOU'RE BEING CUPID FOR BAILEY.
I DON'T DO THAT.

05:51.622 --> 05:53.624
I DID THAT ONCE,
AND SHE YELLED AT ME.

05:53.624 --> 05:55.626
I'LL BE CUPID.
YOU JUST BE THE CHIEF. SIGN.
I AM NOT CUPID.

05:55.626 --> 05:58.088
DR. SHEPHERD, THE REPORTERS
ARE WAITING FOR A STATEMENT.

05:58.088 --> 06:00.030
I HAVE A SURGERY.
WELL, ACTUALLY,
DR. NELSON SAID

06:00.030 --> 06:02.032
HE COULD TAKE
YOUR SKULL FRACTURE.

06:02.032 --> 06:04.034
YOU'VE GOT THE TRUSTEE'S
BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING,

06:04.034 --> 06:06.937
AND WHEN THE TRUSTEES
TURN ON THE 11:00 NEWS,

06:06.937 --> 06:09.970
IT'S YOUR FACE
THEY'LL WANT TO SEE.
(sighs)

06:09.970 --> 06:11.972
(indistinct shouting)

06:11.972 --> 06:14.545
WATCH IT! COMING THROUGH!
(Jackson) I GOT THE ARM.

06:14.545 --> 06:17.878
(Owen) WHAT DO YOU GOT?
(woman) TRAUMATIC AMPUTATION
THROUGH THE LEFT DISTAL HUMERUS.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.080
BLEEDING CONTROLLED THROUGH
PRESSURE. GOT 10 OF MORPHINE.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.612
VITAL SIGNS ARE STABLE.

06:21.612 --> 06:23.884
OKAY, LET'S GET HIM IN TRAUMA 3,
PUT HIM ON A MONITOR.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.956
PUSH TWO OF O-NEG.
GREY, AVERY, YOU'RE WITH ME.

06:25.956 --> 06:27.718
(April) CHIEF SHEPHERD?

06:29.560 --> 06:31.121
(sighs)

06:31.121 --> 06:32.963
(reporters shouting
indistinctly)

06:32.963 --> 06:34.825
(camera shutters clicking)

06:34.825 --> 06:36.597
(reporters continue
shouting indistinctly)

06:44.975 --> 06:46.977
CAN SHE HAVE
SOME WATER, PLEASE?

06:46.977 --> 06:48.479
I'M AFRAID SHE CAN'T.

06:48.479 --> 06:50.841
MY--EMILE, STOP.

06:50.841 --> 06:52.843
MY HUSBAND AND I

06:52.843 --> 06:57.748
HAVE BEEN GOING
TO GRANDINETTI'S FOR 15 YEARS,

06:57.748 --> 06:59.189
EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT.

06:59.189 --> 07:01.992
AND SOMETIMES TUESDAYS.

07:01.992 --> 07:05.025
(chuckles) EMILE ALWAYS TAKES
VERY GOOD CARE OF US.

07:05.025 --> 07:09.159
BUT NOW IT'S TIME
TO LOOK AFTER YOURSELF.

07:09.159 --> 07:11.862
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU'D WANT SOMEONE WITH YOU

07:11.862 --> 07:14.635
UNTIL YOU FOUND OUT
THAT MR. BANKS WAS OKAY.

07:14.635 --> 07:17.067
THANK YOU.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.741
MY PATIENT'S
STALKING YOUR PATIENT.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.613
HE'S BEING A GOOD WAITER,

07:22.613 --> 07:24.144
AND APPARENTLY,
WE'RE HIS BUSBOYS.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.478
DUDE GAVE ME 50 BUCKS
TO PUT HIM NEXT TO HER.

07:27.478 --> 07:30.681
HE'S GOT THE HOTS FOR HER.
HER HUSBAND IS IN SURGERY.
SHE'S MARRIED.

07:30.681 --> 07:32.983
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT 'CAUSE
YOU THINK YOU'RE MARRIED.

07:32.983 --> 07:35.786
HIS 50 BUCKS
SAYS HE MAKES A MOVE.

07:35.786 --> 07:38.128
YOU IN OR OUT?
I'M IN, AND I AM MARRIED.

07:38.128 --> 07:40.130
(April) MRS. SHEPHERD?

07:40.130 --> 07:42.833
HUH?

07:42.833 --> 07:44.495
I'M NOT MRS. SHEPHERD.

07:44.495 --> 07:47.067
YOU'RE NOT?
I'M DR. GREY.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.569
RIGHT. RIGHT.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.571
UM, CHIEF SHEPHERD WANTED ME
TO ASK YOU ABOUT

07:50.571 --> 07:52.673
THE TRUSTEE'S BREAKFAST
IN THE MORNING.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.846
YOU SHEPHERD'S FLUNKY NOW?
IS THAT WHY HE HIRED YOU BACK?

07:55.846 --> 07:58.849
I'M ON HIS SERVICE THIS WEEK,
AND DURING THIS TRANSITION,

07:58.849 --> 08:01.882
HE NEEDED A LITTLE MORE HELP
ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.614
I'M NOT HIS FLUNKY.

08:03.614 --> 08:05.956
SO, UH, WILL YOU BE GOING
WITH HIM TO THE BREAKFAST

08:05.956 --> 08:07.588
OR MEETING HIM THERE?

08:07.588 --> 08:10.661
I, UM, AM NOT SURE
I'M GOING.

08:10.661 --> 08:13.493
WHAT? NO. (laughs)
(chuckles)

08:13.493 --> 08:16.096
YOU HAVE TO
'CAUSE YOU'RE HIS WIFE.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.197
(elevator bell dings)

08:17.197 --> 08:19.600
(snickers)

08:19.600 --> 08:21.031
(indistinct conversations)

08:21.031 --> 08:22.502
SLOAN?

08:22.502 --> 08:25.075
WHEN DID YOU GET IN?
DOES MARK KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

08:25.075 --> 08:27.077
UM, NO. MY FLIGHT GOT IN
A LITTLE BIT EARLY,

08:27.077 --> 08:29.239
AND I JUST TOOK A CAB OVER.
I DIDN'T TO BUG HIM OR ANYTHING.

08:29.239 --> 08:32.212
SOMEBODY SAID THAT YOU GUYS
HAVE A FREE CLINIC?

08:32.212 --> 08:34.214
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS?
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.216
OH, YEAH. I JUST WANT SOMEONE
TO CHECK ME OUT...

08:36.216 --> 08:39.119
(cell phone chirps)
AFTER THE SURGERY
AND EVERYTHING.

08:39.119 --> 08:42.823
MAYBE GIVE ME AN ULTRASOUND
OR SOMETHING?
YEAH, THE CLINIC CLOSED
AN HOUR AGO.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.825
COME ON. I HAVE A SECOND.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.827
I'LL TAKE A PEEK FOR YOU.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.829
OKAY, I NEED ANOTHER 4x4.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.832
OKAY, DRESS HIM. I'M GONNA TAKE
ANOTHER LOOK AT THE ARM.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.834
THIS WOUND'S COMPLETELY
MACERATED AND CONTAMINATED.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.836
WHY WASN'T THIS GUY
BROUGHT IN FIRST?

08:55.836 --> 08:57.838
HE WAS LYING IN
DIRTY DISHWATER FOR A WHILE

08:57.838 --> 09:00.741
BEFORE THEY FOUND HIM.
THEY FORGOT I WAS BACK THERE.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.042
NO, I'M--

09:02.042 --> 09:03.914
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

09:03.914 --> 09:05.876
I'M NOT...

09:05.876 --> 09:07.878
I'M NOT TOO BIG
ON TALKING TO PEOPLE,

09:07.878 --> 09:12.182
AND... NOBODY TALKS TO ME
MUCH BACK THERE.

09:12.182 --> 09:15.285
THEY JUST, YOU KNOW,
BRING ME THE DISHES.

09:17.187 --> 09:19.990
I LOST MY ARM.

09:19.990 --> 09:22.663
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
ONE ARM.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.035
I DON'T WANT TO BE A FREAK.

09:25.035 --> 09:27.167
I-I DON'T LIKE
PEOPLE STARING AT ME.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.870
WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING
THAT WE CAN.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.171
PLEASE.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.674
OKAY, FRANKIE, I'LL TAKE YOU
UP TO SURGERY NOW.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.647
WE'RE GONNA TRY
AND REATTACH THE ARM, OKAY?

09:36.647 --> 09:39.149
WE HAVE AN O.R. I'LL PREP HIM,
WORK ON THE STUMP.

09:39.149 --> 09:41.151
YOU DEBRIDE THE ARM,
TAG THE VESSELS,

09:41.151 --> 09:44.584
AND GET IT UP TO ME
AS SOON AS YOU CAN, OKAY?
OKAY.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.756
(sighs)

09:45.756 --> 09:48.789
WOW. TRAUMA ROOM BARBIE.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.895
OKAY, IRRIGATION HERE
AND SUCTION, PLEASE.
SO...

09:54.895 --> 09:56.196
HERE YOU GO.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.899
GRANDINETTI'S IS GONE--
A SEATTLE INSTITUTION.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.071
HMM. DR. WARREN,
YOU EVER BEEN THERE?

10:01.071 --> 10:02.703
COUPLE TIMES.
GOOD SCAMPI.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.906
PLACE IS SO ROMANTIC--
PERFECTLY LIT, INTIMATE,

10:05.906 --> 10:09.039
THOSE COZY LITTLE BOOTHS,
YOU KNOW, IN BACK.

10:09.039 --> 10:10.711
A 3-0 SILK TIE, PLEASE.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.944
IT'S A LITTLE TOO INTENSE
FOR A FIRST DATE, THOUGH.

10:13.944 --> 10:16.717
BAILEY, WHERE WOULD YOU GO
ON A FIRST DATE?

10:16.717 --> 10:19.920
ISN'T THERE
A DYING CHILD SOMEWHERE?
NO. I HAD SOME TIME,

10:19.920 --> 10:21.992
AND I WANTED TO OBSERVE
ONE OF... ONE OF THESE.

10:21.992 --> 10:23.223
(scoffs)

10:23.223 --> 10:25.195
(ultrasound whooshing)
AWW.

10:25.195 --> 10:27.097
BABY LOOKS PERFECT.

10:27.097 --> 10:28.999
AWESOME.

10:28.999 --> 10:31.301
UM, CAN I, LIKE,
GET THAT IN WRITING?

10:31.301 --> 10:33.904
OH, EVEN BETTER.
(printer whirs and clicks)

10:33.904 --> 10:35.966
HERE IS A SOUVENIR.

10:35.966 --> 10:38.969
OH, UM... WELL, DON'T YOU
HAVE SOME KIND OF,

10:38.969 --> 10:40.941
LIKE, OFFICIAL FORM

10:40.941 --> 10:43.844
OR HOSPITAL DOCUMENT
THAT YOU CAN GIVE ME?

10:43.844 --> 10:45.846
WHY DO YOU NEED
AN OFFICIAL FORM?

10:45.846 --> 10:48.178
OH, WELL, THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

10:48.178 --> 10:51.251
IF YOU WANT YOUR OFFICIAL FORM,
IT IS, SLOAN.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.023
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:53.023 --> 10:56.056
IT'S FOR
THE ADOPTION ATTORNEY, OKAY?

10:56.056 --> 10:59.389
THEY NEED, LIKE, A CLEAN BILL
OF HEALTH FROM ME OR SOMETHING.

10:59.389 --> 11:02.062
THERE'S THIS GREAT COUPLE
IN SAN FRANCISCO,

11:02.062 --> 11:05.095
AND THEY HAVE
THESE TWO BIG DOGS, AND--
AN ADOPTION ATTORNEY?

11:05.095 --> 11:08.098
YEAH. I MEAN, I'M NOT READY
TO BE A MOM.

11:08.098 --> 11:10.801
I'M JUST--
I'M JUST NOT READY YET.

11:10.801 --> 11:12.442
HAVE YOU TOLD MARK?

11:12.442 --> 11:16.076
NO. AND... YOU'RE MY DOCTOR,
RIGHT?

11:16.076 --> 11:18.378
I MEAN, DON'T YOU GUYS
HAVE SOME KIND OF RULE

11:18.378 --> 11:20.951
THAT SAYS
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING?

11:20.951 --> 11:24.114
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA TELL HIM,
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

11:25.756 --> 11:26.757
(clicks)

11:26.757 --> 11:28.058
(air hisses)

11:28.058 --> 11:29.189
(beeps)

11:29.189 --> 11:32.062
DO YOU THINK SHE NEEDS
AN EXTRA BLANKET?

11:32.062 --> 11:34.094
SHE GETS CHILLED EASILY.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.196
SHE MUST BE
ONE HELL OF A TIPPER.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.728
SORRY?

11:37.728 --> 11:40.731
WELL, I CAN SEE WHY
SHE COMES IN EVERY WEEK.

11:40.731 --> 11:43.974
I BET YOU TAKE BETTER CARE
OF HER THAN HER OWN HUSBAND.

11:43.974 --> 11:46.476
(chuckles)

11:46.476 --> 11:50.881
WHEN SHE FIRST STARTED
COMING IN, BEFORE THEY MET,

11:50.881 --> 11:52.282
WE HAD A LITTLE GAME.

11:52.282 --> 11:55.285
SHE WOULD TRY
ANYTHING WE SERVED.

11:55.285 --> 11:57.788
SHE WAS ADVENTUROUS...

11:57.788 --> 12:00.020
FEARLESS.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.092
WHEN SHE'D GONE THROUGH
THE MENU,

12:02.092 --> 12:05.055
I CHALLENGED THE CHEFS
TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW.

12:05.055 --> 12:06.897
(chuckles)
IT BECAME...

12:06.897 --> 12:11.131
SHE BECAME...
MY FAVORITE PART OF THE WEEK.

12:11.131 --> 12:14.935
THEN ONE NIGHT,
SHE CAME IN WITH HIM.

12:14.935 --> 12:18.138
SHE FELT LIKE THIS WAS
A SAFE PLACE FOR A FIRST DATE.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.110
(chuckles)

12:20.110 --> 12:22.372
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

12:22.372 --> 12:24.775
THAT RING ON HER FINGER?

12:24.775 --> 12:28.248
THE NIGHT
HE PROPOSED TO HER...

12:28.248 --> 12:32.352
I PLACED IT IN THE CRèME BRûLéE
FOR HER TO FIND.

12:32.352 --> 12:36.186
I WATCHED HER SAY YES
FROM THE KITCHEN WINDOW.

12:38.789 --> 12:42.492
AND THEY NEVER STOPPED
COMING IN.

12:42.492 --> 12:45.035
BUT NOW HE ORDERS FOR HER--

12:45.035 --> 12:49.239
SAME THING EVERY TIME.

12:49.239 --> 12:50.901
FOR 15 YEARS,

12:50.901 --> 12:54.504
I'VE WATCHED THEIR CONVERSATIONS
GROW SHORTER AND SHORTER,

12:54.504 --> 12:57.477
UNTIL NOW ALL THEY DO IS EAT.

12:59.409 --> 13:01.882
SHE HAS NO CHILDREN.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.387
IF HE DIES, SHE'LL BE...

13:10.190 --> 13:13.163
SHE'LL BE ALL ALONE.

13:13.163 --> 13:16.426
SHE'S SO AFRAID.
I-I CAN SEE.

13:16.426 --> 13:19.429
AND ALL I WANT TO DO
IS TAKE HER HAND IN MINE

13:19.429 --> 13:23.403
AND TELL HER
SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.136
SHE'LL NEVER
HAVE TO BE ALONE...

13:26.136 --> 13:28.839
IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.442
(exhales)

13:35.115 --> 13:36.816
YOU'LL LET ME KNOW

13:36.816 --> 13:39.349
WHEN YOU HAVE GOOD NEWS
ABOUT MR. BANKS, YES?

13:39.349 --> 13:41.291
YEAH. RIGHT.

13:41.291 --> 13:42.822
OF COURSE.

14:11.481 --> 14:13.183
YOU CAN'T LEAVE
WITHOUT TELLING HIM.

14:13.183 --> 14:15.225
YES, I CAN. I CAN DO
WHATEVER I--
SLOAN.

14:15.225 --> 14:16.256
CRAP.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.128
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

14:18.128 --> 14:20.230
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA CALL FIRST.

14:20.230 --> 14:22.933
LOOK.
OH, MY GOD.

14:22.933 --> 14:24.434
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

14:24.434 --> 14:27.267
THAT'S THE SLOAN NOSE.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.269
CAN YOU--CAN YOU SEE IT?

14:29.269 --> 14:32.572
CAN YOU SEE IT?

14:32.572 --> 14:35.946
IT'S MY DAD'S.
HE HAS MY DAD'S NOSE.

14:35.946 --> 14:38.278
THAT'S THE SLOAN NOSE.

14:38.278 --> 14:41.251
(pager beeps)

14:41.251 --> 14:43.253
DAMN IT.
WILL YOU WAIT FOR ME?

14:43.253 --> 14:45.956
I WANT TO--
I WANT TO TAKE YOU HOME.

14:45.956 --> 14:48.588
I GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU.
OH, COULD I SEE THIS AGAIN?

14:48.588 --> 14:51.191
(sighs) THE SLOAN NOSE.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.668
YOU WIN.

14:58.668 --> 15:01.471
HE'S BEEN STARING AT HER FROM
HIS KITCHEN FOR 15 YEARS.

15:01.471 --> 15:04.434
HE'S NOT GONNA TELL HER NOW.
HE JUST DID. SHE WAS
AWAKE THE WHOLE TIME.

15:04.434 --> 15:07.137
SHE HEARD EVERYTHING.
SHE HAS TO SAY SOMETHING.

15:07.137 --> 15:10.440
WELL, SHE'S NOT. HE--
HER HUSBAND'S IN SURGERY.
SO? THEY'RE CLEARLY MISERABLE.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.043
I MEAN, DID YOU HEAR
THE WHOLE CRèME BRûLéE THING?

15:13.043 --> 15:17.317
50 BUCKS SAYS SHE TELLS HIM
SHE LOVES HIM, TOO.
YOU'RE ON.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.518
HI.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.991
I'VE GOT YOUR KEYS.
(keys jangle)

15:20.991 --> 15:23.593
WHAT?
DR. SHEPHERD TOLD ME
YOU MIGHT NOT MAKE IT HOME

15:23.593 --> 15:26.026
BEFORE THE BREAKFAST,
SO I SHOULD JUST ASK YOU

15:26.026 --> 15:28.658
WHAT YOU NEED FROM YOUR CLOSET,
AND I'LL GO GRAB IT FOR YOU.
YOU ARE NOT GOING IN MY CLOSET.

15:28.658 --> 15:31.601
AREN'T YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE A SURGEON?
HE REALLY NEEDS YOU
BY HIS SIDE

15:31.601 --> 15:34.264
AT THAT BREAKFAST.
I AM A SURGEON.

15:34.264 --> 15:38.008
YOU TELL THE CHIEF
THAT I WILL BE IN SURGERY.

15:38.008 --> 15:42.342
UH, SO--SO I'LL JUST
PICK SOMETHING OUT FOR YOU.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.415
SO... YANG'S WITH HUNT,

15:45.415 --> 15:49.249
GREY'S WITH SHEPHERD,
TORRES IS WITH ROBBINS,

15:49.249 --> 15:52.252
AND YOU WERE WITH SLOAN
UNTIL HE DUMPED YOU?

15:52.252 --> 15:54.954
IT'S A WONDER YOU GUYS
GOT ANY WORK DONE.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.256
HE DIDN'T DUMP ME.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.957
HE FORGOT ABOUT ME.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.031
HE DECIDED THAT WE WERE
GOING TO START A FAMILY

16:01.031 --> 16:02.662
AND DIDN'T ASK ME.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.664
HE FORGOT I WAS EVEN THERE.

16:04.664 --> 16:09.499
HE--HE JUST... LEFT ME
LYING IN DIRTY DISHWATER.

16:09.499 --> 16:11.741
WHAT?

16:11.741 --> 16:14.204
NOTHING.

16:17.747 --> 16:19.379
I'M PRETTY.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.051
WHAT?

16:21.051 --> 16:23.513
IN MY FAMILY,
I'M THE PRETTY ONE.

16:23.513 --> 16:28.258
YOU KNOW, UH, MY EYES
AND... MY SMILE AND MY BODY.

16:28.258 --> 16:31.221
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD SEE ME
WITHOUT A SHIRT ON.

16:31.221 --> 16:33.223
IT'S--
IT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS.

16:33.223 --> 16:35.565
BUT MY FAMILY
IS SMART, DRIVEN,

16:35.565 --> 16:37.667
CRAZY OVERACHIEVERS,
YOU KNOW?

16:37.667 --> 16:39.669
AND THEY LOOK
LIKE THEY'RE SMART.

16:39.669 --> 16:43.233
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE ME,
WHICH HAD ITS PERKS,

16:43.233 --> 16:46.236
EXCEPT THAT MY FAMILY
TREATED ME LIKE I'M PRETTY.

16:46.236 --> 16:49.339
THEY EXPECTED NOTHING
FROM ME... EVER.

16:49.339 --> 16:52.212
THEY NEVER PUSHED ME,
NEVER THOUGHT TO.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.484
SO I HAD TO PUSH MYSELF...

16:54.484 --> 16:56.246
HARD.

16:56.246 --> 16:59.249
I DIDN'T EVEN TELL 'EM
I WAS TAKING THE MCAT's

16:59.249 --> 17:01.251
TILL AFTER I HAD ACED 'EM.

17:01.251 --> 17:03.693
(sighs)

17:03.693 --> 17:06.696
MY POINT IS THAT YOU CAN'T
JUST CHANGE YOUR HAIR.

17:06.696 --> 17:08.698
OKAY, YOU WANT TO BE
UNFORGETTABLE?

17:08.698 --> 17:10.700
YOU WANT TO NOT BE MOUSY?

17:10.700 --> 17:12.762
YOU CAN'T
JUST CHANGE YOUR HAIR.

17:12.762 --> 17:14.704
YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY CHANGE.

17:16.706 --> 17:19.038
I'M JUST SAYING.

17:22.172 --> 17:24.214
OKAY, I'M REMOVING

17:24.214 --> 17:29.319
THE GLASS... VERY... SLOWLY.

17:29.319 --> 17:31.681
OKAY, TAKE THIS. BOVIE.

17:31.681 --> 17:33.753
NICE WORK, DR. BAILEY.
(bovie sizzling)

17:33.753 --> 17:36.356
DR. WARREN, CAN YOU BELIEVE
THAT DR. BAILEY

17:36.356 --> 17:38.588
ALMOST LEFT GENERAL SURGERY
FOR PEDS SURGERY?

17:38.588 --> 17:40.590
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
I DID NOT.

17:40.590 --> 17:43.493
YEAH. NO, SHE ALMOST
SAID NO TO GENERAL SURGERY.

17:43.493 --> 17:45.535
BUT THEN
SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

17:45.535 --> 17:49.639
AND SHE CHANGED HER MIND.

17:49.639 --> 17:52.302
SHE WASN'T AFRAID
TO RETHINK HER DECISION.

17:52.302 --> 17:55.705
SHE JUST NEEDED
TO BE ASKED AGAIN.
I SEE.

17:55.705 --> 17:58.148
(bovie sizzling)
CLEARLY.

17:58.148 --> 18:02.282
(sizzling continues)

18:02.282 --> 18:04.614
(sighs)

18:04.614 --> 18:06.616
DO YOU HAVE
MY REPORT THING?

18:06.616 --> 18:08.158
NO.

18:08.158 --> 18:10.520
HE TOOK YOU IN,
HE'S GIVEN YOU MONEY,

18:10.520 --> 18:13.523
HE FLEW YOU TO L.A.
HE DESERVES TO KNOW.

18:13.523 --> 18:16.226
SO IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TELL HIM, I WILL.

18:16.226 --> 18:18.198
YOU PAGED ME?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:18.198 --> 18:19.529
YOU PAGED HIM?

18:19.529 --> 18:21.301
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

18:24.274 --> 18:26.206
MARK, SHE'S--

18:26.206 --> 18:28.508
I'M GIVING THE BABY UP
FOR ADOPTION.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.580
I'M NOT A MOM.
I'M NOT READY.

18:30.580 --> 18:33.283
AND I WANT HIM TO HAVE
GOOD PARENTS

18:33.283 --> 18:35.285
AND A GOOD HOME.

18:35.285 --> 18:38.748
NO, DON'T. DON'T DO THIS.
DON'T GIVE THIS BABY AWAY.
THEY'LL LOVE HIM.

18:38.748 --> 18:41.291
THEY'LL LOVE HIM
MORE THAN I WILL.

18:41.291 --> 18:44.294
GIVE HIM TO ME.

18:44.294 --> 18:47.527
I'LL TAKE HIM.
I'LL ADOPT HIM.

18:49.329 --> 18:52.732
I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE NOT READY, BUT I AM.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.865
AND I KNOW I-I DON'T HAVE
THE BEST TRACK RECORD,

18:55.865 --> 18:58.868
AND I--AND I SHOULD'VE BEEN
THERE FOR YOU, AND I WASN'T.

18:58.868 --> 19:02.472
BUT I WILL BE THERE
FOR THIS BABY. PLEASE.

19:02.472 --> 19:05.245
I WANT HIM TO HAVE A FAMILY.
AND, I MEAN,

19:05.245 --> 19:07.877
YOU'VE BEEN REALLY NICE TO ME
THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS,

19:07.877 --> 19:10.550
BUT YOU'RE NOT A FAMILY.
YOU'RE JUST A GUY.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.783
SLOAN, PLEASE.
I'LL HELP.

19:13.783 --> 19:16.686
UH... (chuckles)

19:16.686 --> 19:19.289
I'M RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL.

19:19.289 --> 19:22.262
AND WE'RE A FAMILY,
SORT OF.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.264
AND... WE'RE DOCTORS...

19:24.264 --> 19:27.437
AND WE'RE BEST FRIENDS,

19:27.437 --> 19:30.300

YOUR SPEECH FOR THIS MORNING.

29:13.382 --> 29:16.085
YOU ARE? YOU WANT TO BE
AN EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT?

29:16.085 --> 29:19.959
YOU SHOULD WANT TO DO SURGERY.
THAT'S ALL I WANT TO DO.
I'M NOT SURE I CAN.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.761
I... LOOK, I'M GRATEFUL
THAT YOU HIRED ME BACK.

29:22.761 --> 29:26.365
IT'S JUST BEEN EASIER
TO HELP OUT WITH THIS STUFF.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.297
IT'S EASIER COMING BACK
AS THAT

29:28.297 --> 29:30.299
RATHER THAN COMING BACK
AS THE DOCTOR

29:30.299 --> 29:32.301
WHO MADE A MISTAKE
AND KILLED SOMEONE...

29:32.301 --> 29:34.003
KILLED SOMEONE'S MOM.

29:34.003 --> 29:36.005
AND I'M NOT SURE
I CAN BE THAT PERSON.

29:36.005 --> 29:38.347
SO IF YOU'RE NOT SURE
THAT YOU NEED ME,

29:38.347 --> 29:40.349
THEN MAYBE
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

29:40.349 --> 29:43.352
DR. SHEPHERD, I HAVE A PATIENT
WITH AN EPIDURAL BLEED.

29:44.914 --> 29:47.987
COME WITH ME.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.195
YOU COULDN'T DO IT?

29:56.195 --> 29:58.267
ACTUALLY, WE COULD.

29:58.267 --> 30:00.269
BUT, UM, YOU NEED
TO PREPARE YOURSELF.

30:00.269 --> 30:03.332
WE NEEDED TO TAKE
SOME EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES.

30:03.332 --> 30:05.935
YOUR ARM NEEDED
A BLOOD SUPPLY TO KEEP IT ALIVE

30:05.935 --> 30:07.576
UNTIL WE COULD REATTACH IT,

30:07.576 --> 30:09.979
SO WE HAD TO RELOCATE IT

30:09.979 --> 30:12.341
TO WHERE WE COULD GET ONE.

30:17.446 --> 30:20.589
(mutters) IS THAT MY ARM?!

30:20.589 --> 30:24.353
WHAT DID YOU DO?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

30:24.353 --> 30:28.227
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?
IT'S--IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.459
OKAY, IT--IT--
JUST FOR A FEW DAYS.

30:30.459 --> 30:32.461
FRANKIE, THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANTED.

30:32.461 --> 30:34.203
YOU--YOU WANTED YOUR ARM.

30:34.203 --> 30:35.865
IN THE RIGHT PLACE!

30:35.865 --> 30:38.507
I SAID I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE A FREAK.

30:38.507 --> 30:42.471
YOU SHOULDA LEFT ME
LIKE I WAS!
