Use your full
extension and push through the floor.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.866
See who finally showed up.

03:20.159 --> 03:23.953
Paige, go to the corner
and stretch, please.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.622
I'm fine.

03:26.623 --> 03:30.044
I'm sure you are. Now go!

03:50.022 --> 03:53.025
Chin up
and keep the line strong.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.622
Somebody's definitely
in trouble.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.499
If you're late all the time.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.502
Have I missed something ladies?

04:15.338 --> 04:18.173
Annabel, move to the other side
of the barre.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.011
OK everyone,
let's move to center.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.255
Is something wrong?

05:39.256 --> 05:44.093
I was wondering if you could make
this look any more difficult.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.095
Don't bite your lip.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.139
Paige, you are a performer.

05:48.140 --> 05:51.851
Everyone should think
that this is easy.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.687
Again.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.501
Lynda, open up.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.463
I know you're here,
your car's outside.

06:22.299 --> 06:25.260
This is ridiculous,
just open the door.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.143
Dad?

06:35.687 --> 06:38.772
Hey buddy,
can you open the door?

06:38.773 --> 06:40.275
No.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.279
I'm sorry Dad,
Mom says I can't open it.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.282
Come on, Alex!

06:48.325 --> 06:50.701
It's fine, Alex.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.328
Lynda, it's so like you.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.872
You told my lawyer you
didn't receive the paperwork.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.292
I'm just going to leave
it under the door.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.880
Please go through it
and call me.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.155
He didn't even say bye.

07:28.782 --> 07:33.453
It's OK, honey,
he's just upset... with me.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.878
What's that?

07:43.130 --> 07:45.547
Just paperwork.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.259
Didn't you say you had
something to show me?

07:48.260 --> 07:49.260
Yes!

07:49.261 --> 07:50.761
We need to use a computer.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.180
Follow me.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.529
Reverence!

08:21.251 --> 08:22.752
Good job everyone!

08:25.546 --> 08:28.342
Paige, we'll start in five.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.543
Nice.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.421
I've been worried about you.

09:08.548 --> 09:12.052
Glenn, I'm sorry I was late.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.596
How are things at home?

09:19.476 --> 09:20.851
Shall we start?

09:20.852 --> 09:23.604
Someone has that San Francisco
audition soon.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.658
Excellent work tonight.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.620
I think you're about ready.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.997
Let's go home.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.792
That class felt so long.

11:08.793 --> 11:12.879
How many pliés did we do,
like a hundred?

11:12.880 --> 11:15.341
I know. We did so many.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.302
My legs are killing me.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.096
Yeah, mine too.

11:23.724 --> 11:27.019
How was your private, Paige?

11:27.020 --> 11:31.231
Fine I guess,
could've been better.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.985
Paige, you're never happy.

11:34.986 --> 11:37.947
Come on guys our ride's here.

12:03.598 --> 12:04.806
Is Paige in there?

12:04.807 --> 12:06.724
Yeah she's inside.

12:06.725 --> 12:09.186
Good. See you girls tomorrow.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.273
One second.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.818
Come in.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.990
What's wrong with your foot?

12:22.325 --> 12:23.826
Nothing.

12:35.338 --> 12:38.382
It's not a big deal.

12:38.383 --> 12:43.470
You don't have to
kill yourself, Paige.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.306
I'm just trying so hard,
and ballet is the only thing

12:46.307 --> 12:48.017
I want to do.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.772
You don't understand.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.152
I do understand.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.281
It's getting late,

13:02.282 --> 13:04.575
you better go.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.620
I'll see you tomorrow.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.574
It's almost midnight.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.993
Mom, please don't start this,

13:47.994 --> 13:49.454
it's only eleven.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.417
Come here.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.970
Sit.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.936
I called you.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.647
My phone was dead.

14:16.648 --> 14:17.939
The calls went through.

14:17.940 --> 14:21.319
Well then I
didn't hear it, sorry.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.116
We need to talk about
your recent test scores.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.536
Is there a problem?

14:30.537 --> 14:33.956
Yeah, Alex showed me
you're not doing well in math.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.000
I got two B's.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.461
So what?

14:39.462 --> 14:41.622
Well... I signed you up with a
math tutor after school.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.008
You what?

14:45.009 --> 14:48.303
- I signed you up...
- I heard that.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.682
Mom, my grades are fine.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.476
I don't need a tutor.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.687
Alex has C's.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.313
Does he need a tutor?

14:58.314 --> 15:00.774
You know well enough
he's a smart boy.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.902
He does not need a tutor.

15:09.367 --> 15:14.538
And we can't afford to pay for
both ballet class and a tutor.

15:14.539 --> 15:17.040
I have two important auditions
coming up.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.877
I can't afford to take
anytime off.

15:19.878 --> 15:23.129
Well, improve your grades and then
we can talk about all your auditions.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.214
But right now,

15:24.215 --> 15:25.716
you need to focus

15:25.717 --> 15:27.760
on getting into college.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.554
Like I'm even going.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.431
I heard that young lady,

15:32.432 --> 15:33.724
and to tell you the truth,

15:33.725 --> 15:36.476
I am sick of all of this.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.687
All you do is dance.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.565
You don't go and
experience life.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.982
There's so much more to it

15:42.983 --> 15:43.983
and you don't even know-

15:43.984 --> 15:45.361
Like what?

15:46.487 --> 15:48.947
What would you prefer me to do?

15:48.948 --> 15:54.244
Go out, party, get drunk
and high with my friends?

15:54.245 --> 15:56.747
Well, I don't have
to worry about that.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.373
You spend so much time dancing,

15:58.374 --> 15:59.499
you don't have any friends

15:59.500 --> 16:02.044
to get high or drunk with.

16:03.379 --> 16:07.467
What is your problem
with me dancing?

16:08.676 --> 16:10.552
I'm so much better now,

16:10.553 --> 16:12.178
but I don't even remember

16:12.179 --> 16:14.765
the last time you bothered
to even come and watch me.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.224
My point is,

16:16.225 --> 16:17.225
maybe,

16:17.226 --> 16:18.226
just maybe,

16:18.227 --> 16:20.395
this will be good for you.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.564
To take a break from dancing
go to college-

16:22.565 --> 16:26.527
Maybe... you could just
respect what I want to do.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.905
Or...

16:29.906 --> 16:32.617
Maybe you need
to look in a mirror.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.244
And finally see...

16:36.830 --> 16:40.248
Yeah, you got a degree,

16:40.249 --> 16:43.461
but it didn't stop Dad
from leaving you.

forget about your bad grades.

Sorry!

18:26.814 --> 18:28.857
OK.

18:28.858 --> 18:32.193
You have your first meeting with
your tutor today after school.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.947
Please, don't be late.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.369
Did you really have
to schedule it so it conflicts

18:41.370 --> 18:42.288
with my ballet classes?

18:42.289 --> 18:43.997
Well, we haven't paid

18:43.998 --> 18:45.624
for this months ballet classes,

18:45.625 --> 18:48.252
so your schedule cleared up.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.506
Hey! Where are you going?

18:53.507 --> 18:55.133
What about breakfast?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.928
I lost my appetite.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.266
Mom, I didn't lose my appetite!

19:40.805 --> 19:42.806
off at school and
I'm going to an interview.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.224
I don't have time to
discuss our issues right now.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.144
Lynda, there's
nothing to discuss.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.436
I need you to sign the papers.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.814
Derek! I am running late
for an interview.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.107
I am taking care of two kids.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.067
I want to talk,

19:54.068 --> 19:56.588
so let's just schedule a time
when we can go over all of it, OK?

20:08.041 --> 20:09.457
So Lynda,

20:09.458 --> 20:11.334
we're looking for someone

20:11.335 --> 20:13.045
who just graduated university

20:13.046 --> 20:15.255
for an entry level position.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.924
You don't have enough experience

20:17.925 --> 20:20.259
for our higher positions.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.928
But I was told you help women

20:21.929 --> 20:23.847
like me who are struggling-

20:23.848 --> 20:27.225
Honey listen, I know you think
this is the worst that it can get.

20:27.226 --> 20:31.188
But we just hired
two disabled ladies.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.314
So you're saying
you can't help me

20:33.315 --> 20:35.233
because I'm not disabled.

20:35.234 --> 20:39.445
Even though I'm about to be
left on my own with two kids?

20:39.446 --> 20:40.864
I wish you had more

20:40.865 --> 20:43.616
experience because you
have a relevant degree.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.661
But I can't help you right now.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.498
You can come back later?

20:51.584 --> 20:54.545
I just really need
this right now.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.607
So, you're my tutor?

21:15.357 --> 21:16.859
Yes, I am.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.737
Great.

21:20.738 --> 21:24.866
I just want to know
what your weak areas are?

21:24.867 --> 21:26.201
I don't have any.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.368
It's math and...

21:27.369 --> 21:28.829
I'm pretty good at it.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.749
OK, but your mom told me-

21:32.750 --> 21:34.167
I don't want to hear it.

21:34.168 --> 21:36.254
Two B's are not a big deal.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.842
Are you running late
for something?

21:42.843 --> 21:44.052
My first audition is in a week,

21:44.053 --> 21:46.472
and I'm stuck here with you.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.645

I thought-

Come on, it was obviously Paige.

23:05.218 --> 23:08.179
I tried to talk to her,
but she was so fast.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.224

23:13.517 --> 23:14.726
OK, all of you,

23:14.727 --> 23:16.435
just quit it.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.072
Paige?

24:09.073 --> 24:11.367
You stayed at school
for so long...

24:15.453 --> 24:17.663
I had some stuff to do, Alex.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.040
Oh Paige... Um...

24:19.041 --> 24:21.500
I just got off with
the phone with... Ahh...

24:21.501 --> 24:23.379
what's his name... Ah Dylan.

24:24.922 --> 24:27.506
What does he need?

24:27.507 --> 24:30.302
Well, he said you made
a lot of progress today.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.137
Oh...

24:32.138 --> 24:33.972
I guess we did.

24:33.973 --> 24:37.017
He sounds very-very nice.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.730
Oh also, he mentioned the...

24:42.731 --> 24:44.149
Grand Canyon trip.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.984
I don't know why
you've never mentioned it -

24:45.985 --> 24:47.319

24:47.320 --> 24:49.321
The Grand Canyon.

24:49.322 --> 24:50.905

24:53.617 --> 24:54.909
and when.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.369
Great!

Hey!

24:57.495 --> 24:59.622
Ugh...

24:59.623 --> 25:01.624
Dinner is in thirty minutes.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.335

26:44.061 --> 26:45.895
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Oh... no.

26:45.896 --> 26:47.105
That's not for me.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.606
I just get you there. Follow me.

26:51.569 --> 26:52.860
So, how is your day
going so far?

26:52.861 --> 26:54.904
Oh! Good! Thank you.
How is yours?

26:54.905 --> 26:56.906
Pretty good. Thanks.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.700
Good luck.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.838
Well, hi.

27:15.926 --> 27:18.428
If I didn't know you guys,
I'd think you're stalking me.

27:18.429 --> 27:19.678
Oh... You know.

27:19.679 --> 27:22.141
It looks like
you're hiding from us.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.810
Well, there is no where
to run now.

27:25.811 --> 27:26.978
Very funny, Paige.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.563
Glenn wants to talk to you.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.107
Just tell him I quit.

27:30.941 --> 27:32.317
You can't be serious.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.776
We don't have time
for this, Paige.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.945
Whatever it is,
it can't be that bad.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.323
Just show up for practice.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.659
I have a math tutor.

27:42.660 --> 27:45.246
That's hilarious.
Did you fail or something?

27:45.247 --> 27:47.415
I got two B's.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.417
But to my mom,
that's basically failing.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.002
Your mom's always been intense.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.421
Do you remember when
you were younger and your mom

27:53.422 --> 27:56.215
was crazy about competitions?

27:56.216 --> 27:59.760
It was so long ago,
I almost forgot.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.471
Well, I didn't.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.389
Shoot, Leah, we're super late.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.682
It's all your fault.

28:05.683 --> 28:08.020
Just come to the academy
after school.

28:08.979 --> 28:11.064
You should really talk to Glenn.

28:16.736 --> 28:17.820
Hi.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.907
I'm... I'm Lynda Johnson.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.251
Harry, nice to meet you.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.920
Please have a seat.

28:34.921 --> 28:38.424
So what kind of position are
you looking for?

28:38.425 --> 28:41.595
Oh... any entry level
position is fine.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.142
What job experience do
you have in this field?

28:48.143 --> 28:51.812
Well, I graduated from the
University of Arizona.

28:51.813 --> 28:54.023
I got a degree in economics,

28:54.024 --> 28:55.858
I did a couple of internships

28:55.859 --> 28:57.985
during college, and...

28:57.986 --> 29:01.197
then I took care of my kids
for 17 years.

29:01.198 --> 29:03.659
But what job experience
do you have?

29:05.327 --> 29:06.369
Uh... Well, like I said

29:06.370 --> 29:07.620
I had three

29:07.621 --> 29:09.622
internships during school,

29:09.623 --> 29:12.333
and being a stay-at-home mom

29:12.334 --> 29:14.460
requires its own kind of supply

29:14.461 --> 29:16.630
and demand economics.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.215
Hmm.

29:19.216 --> 29:23.262
What I meant was, why did you
decide to change fields?

29:25.514 --> 29:26.847
I just...

29:26.848 --> 29:33.229
Ugh... I really need
the money right now.

29:33.230 --> 29:35.147
So you're looking for
something temporary?

29:35.148 --> 29:36.399
Oh, no. That's not what I meant.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.109
I'm absolutely
serious about this.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.070
Do you know how to use Excel?

29:41.280 --> 29:42.989
Yeah, of course.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.242
Great.

29:46.243 --> 29:50.455
We will let you know our
decision by the end of next week.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.291
- OK.
- Thank you.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.710
Thank you.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.096
Asshole.

30:07.097 --> 30:10.392
What kind of experience
do you have in the field?

30:31.622 --> 30:33.999
You're late. Again.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.630
Don't tell me it's your dinner.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.511
It's not my favorite.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.681
You don't have to eat it
if you don't like it.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.225
I was wondering...

30:53.226 --> 30:55.228
could we change the time
of our sessions?

30:56.814 --> 30:59.857
Sounds like someone's
asking for a favor.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.275
No.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.610
You told my mom about our trip

31:02.611 --> 31:03.695
to the Grand Canyon,

31:03.696 --> 31:05.655
and this is just payback.

31:05.656 --> 31:08.283
Come on!
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.828
Seriously... I really need to

31:11.829 --> 31:13.454
train for this audition.

31:13.455 --> 31:15.957
Can we change the time
until after classes?

31:17.626 --> 31:20.003
I usually rehearse
right after class.

31:20.838 --> 31:22.421
Music. I play music.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.006
Are you serious?

31:24.007 --> 31:26.801
I'm auditioning for the
San Francisco Ballet Theater,

31:26.802 --> 31:28.302
and you can't change your time

31:28.303 --> 31:30.222
because of... music stuff?

31:44.152 --> 31:46.320
You see, anyone can be
a ballerina.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.865
No training, no classes needed.

31:48.866 --> 31:51.784
It's hard to deny you have some
pretty impressive moves.

31:51.785 --> 31:52.703
I can teach you.

31:52.704 --> 31:55.873
Oh yeah?

32:07.175 --> 32:09.844
All right. Fine, we can
meet right after class.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.597
Thank you.

32:12.890 --> 32:14.391
I think we should get going.

32:17.519 --> 32:19.687
I have some cool
equations you can solve.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.480
I know you can't solve it
without me.

Hey... are you all right?

34:37.242 --> 34:40.828
My mom isn't going to pay
for classes anymore...

34:40.829 --> 34:42.413
I just wanted to let you know.

34:42.414 --> 34:46.542
What happened between
the two of you?

34:46.543 --> 34:50.255
She has different ideas about
how I should spend my free time.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.469
I think you were 11 when
you joined our school?

34:57.303 --> 34:59.514
I think so.

35:03.685 --> 35:06.478
I'll tell you what we can do.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.940
You can come for class
and rehearsals for free

35:08.941 --> 35:12.109
until your
San Francisco audition.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.486
Really?

35:15.321 --> 35:16.823
Thank you so much.

35:27.751 --> 35:28.876
Should I get it?

35:28.877 --> 35:30.544
Oh... No, honey.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.338
Ah... I got it.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.764
Hello.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.182
I can start tomorrow.

35:44.183 --> 35:46.018
Great.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.896
Oh, thank you so much.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.607
Who called?

35:51.190 --> 35:53.317
What honey?

35:53.318 --> 35:55.277
Who called?

35:55.278 --> 35:56.946
Ahh, well,

35:56.947 --> 35:59.448
if you have to know,
smarty pants,

35:59.449 --> 36:01.993
I got a job.

36:01.994 --> 36:03.119
Like a real job?

36:03.120 --> 36:04.202
Yeah.

36:04.203 --> 36:05.705
Like Dad?

36:07.666 --> 36:10.543
Yeah... Like Dad.

36:11.962 --> 36:13.713
Cool.

36:36.402 --> 36:37.903
Look at all of them.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.739
They've come so far...

36:42.575 --> 36:43.659
And so have you.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.746
Paige, are you also
going on that trip...

36:47.747 --> 36:49.040
Leah, where's the trip to?

36:49.041 --> 36:51.375
- The Grand Can-
- The Grand Canyon.

36:51.376 --> 36:53.002
Yeah, I am.

36:53.003 --> 36:54.378
Good for you.

36:54.379 --> 36:57.173
See it's OK
to have some fun sometimes.

36:57.174 --> 36:58.507
Now you sound like my mom.

36:58.508 --> 37:00.051
You need to get some rest.

37:00.052 --> 37:02.220
And hey, you two, let's go,
let's go.

37:17.069 --> 37:18.402
I remember you.

37:18.403 --> 37:21.363
You interviewed that day
Harry was so cranky.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.115
Ugh...

37:23.116 --> 37:24.366
I hope the employee orientation
wasn't too overwhelming...

37:24.367 --> 37:26.118
It was impressively long.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.452
It's company policy.

37:27.453 --> 37:29.246
Oh.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.330
Soo-o...

37:30.331 --> 37:31.917
This is your desk.

37:35.128 --> 37:37.130
I know it... it kinda sucks.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.717
Do you think a plant would help?

37:41.259 --> 37:42.760
Mmmmm. No.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.970
I mean I have a cactus,
but it's slowly dying.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.889
Oh, no light?

37:46.890 --> 37:49.016
No, I'm pretty sure I'm just
really bad with plants.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.268
Umm... So, you know what to do?

37:51.269 --> 37:53.230
Mh-mm, just organize...

37:53.980 --> 37:55.731
all of this.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.442
- Good luck.
- Hmm.

38:56.209 --> 38:57.918
Paige!

38:57.919 --> 38:59.378
How are you?

39:00.130 --> 39:01.673
I'm... good.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.883
Is everything OK?

39:04.884 --> 39:06.970
Yeah, everything is fine.

39:08.305 --> 39:09.471
I've gotta run.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.016
And Glenn is in no mood today.

39:13.268 --> 39:15.436
Good luck.

39:26.906 --> 39:29.658
I'm fine.

39:29.659 --> 39:32.661
It's all
going to be fine.

39:32.662 --> 39:34.164
I'm ready.

39:47.093 --> 39:50.595
Hey!
How is your first day going?

39:50.596 --> 39:52.806
Ohh...

39:52.807 --> 39:55.600
What happened to you?

39:55.601 --> 40:00.480
Um... This building is
sucking the energy out of me.

40:00.481 --> 40:03.317
Well, I like your sense
of humor.

40:03.318 --> 40:04.818
Umm... Hmmm...

40:04.819 --> 40:06.862
Are you done for the day?

40:06.863 --> 40:08.239
Yes, a group of us

40:08.240 --> 40:10.657
we usually go out after
work on Mondays.

40:10.658 --> 40:11.910
You should come.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.453
What? We're cool.

40:15.454 --> 40:18.415
Oh no-no-no... No. I have kids.

40:18.416 --> 40:22.253
Soo-o... get a babysitter.

40:22.254 --> 40:23.796
Husband?

40:24.881 --> 40:26.298
Boyfriend?

40:26.299 --> 40:28.884
Hmm, no. It's just...
it's complicated.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.263
See!
You should definitely join us.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.767
Can I get a rain check?

40:38.019 --> 40:39.979
Bye.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.024
Bye.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.418
Knock-knock.

41:02.043 --> 41:03.253
Come in.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.842
You missed dinner.

41:10.635 --> 41:13.095
I already ate at school,

41:13.096 --> 41:16.349
and... healthy snack.

41:17.642 --> 41:20.437
Can you close your laptop,
please?

41:34.492 --> 41:37.286
Just let me help you.

41:37.287 --> 41:39.288
Oh, well,
I guess I should have waited

41:39.289 --> 41:43.250
for the miracle of you
cleaning your room.

41:43.251 --> 41:45.670
You shouldn't have to
pick up for me.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.471
What were you watching?

41:57.974 --> 41:59.684
Like you even care.

42:01.602 --> 42:02.979
Well...

42:07.484 --> 42:10.236
Do you want to watch
something together?

42:11.988 --> 42:14.324
Do you really wanna
watch ballet?

42:15.158 --> 42:16.616
Or...

42:16.617 --> 42:18.994
Do you want to watch me dance?

42:18.995 --> 42:22.040
Well, I do have
a lot of laundry.

42:23.208 --> 42:26.168
I can dance right here,
right now.

42:26.169 --> 42:28.463
Let's just talk.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.757
About?

42:33.759 --> 42:36.137
Did you talk to your dad at all?

42:37.972 --> 42:40.057
He called me.

42:40.058 --> 42:42.184
I didn't answer.

42:42.185 --> 42:44.144
He's still your father.

42:44.145 --> 42:46.147
He left without saying a word.

42:52.028 --> 42:54.155
I think he just needs time.

42:58.617 --> 43:01.619
I do have some great
news though...

43:01.620 --> 43:03.331
I got a job.

43:04.332 --> 43:06.583
- Really?
- Come on!

43:06.584 --> 43:09.211
Why is everyone so
surprised at this?

43:14.050 --> 43:16.135
So, it's serious then?

43:16.886 --> 43:18.637
You and Dad?

43:22.392 --> 43:24.227
I don't know.

43:25.395 --> 43:27.730
But you need to call him back.

43:32.235 --> 43:33.778
Whatever.

43:34.820 --> 43:37.198
I'm tired. I'm gonna go to bed.

43:38.241 --> 43:40.285
OK.

43:42.245 --> 43:44.372
Good night.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.222
Yeah...

44:02.223 --> 44:04.683
Twenty years of marriage
and you have nothing to say?

44:10.148 --> 44:13.025
Hi, Paige! How's ballet?

44:16.571 --> 44:19.573
Seriously? Ballet?

44:19.574 --> 44:22.033
You can't talk to your daughter
about anything more meaningful?

44:22.034 --> 44:23.452
What?

44:23.453 --> 44:25.162
Oh-Talk to her about
college... I...

44:25.163 --> 44:28.165
I mean if you paid
any attention.

44:28.166 --> 44:30.083
What's going on with her?

44:30.084 --> 44:32.377
She didn't even say "hi".

44:32.378 --> 44:33.837
What did you expect?

44:33.838 --> 44:35.839
A daddy of the year speech?

44:35.840 --> 44:38.300
At least "hi" to her dad,
who she hasn't seen in a while.

44:38.301 --> 44:39.884
Oh! Welcome to my life.

44:39.885 --> 44:41.886
She's a teenager now,
in case you hadn't noticed.

44:41.887 --> 44:43.388
Oh yes, Lynda!

44:43.389 --> 44:45.015
I didn't notice that
my daughter's grown up.

44:45.016 --> 44:48.394
Well, it wouldn't surprise me
if you hadn't.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.313
Can you not smoke?

44:51.314 --> 44:54.858
No! If I wanna smoke, I will!
As much as I'd like!

44:54.859 --> 44:57.902
Fine. Lynda, I didn't come here
to argue.

44:57.903 --> 44:59.695
Why did you come here?

44:59.696 --> 45:01.198
Please, stop.

45:01.199 --> 45:02.659
Stop what?

45:03.660 --> 45:05.952
I came because you told me to.

45:05.953 --> 45:08.331
Why couldn't you just
sign the papers?

45:11.834 --> 45:13.126
Derek, I really think we can
fix this if we work it...

45:13.127 --> 45:14.169
- Lynda.
- Alex!

45:14.170 --> 45:15.547
Lynda!

45:16.464 --> 45:17.965
I met someone.

45:21.260 --> 45:23.428
And I love her.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.181
And I cannot be with you.

45:35.692 --> 45:37.025
Come on, Alex!

45:37.026 --> 45:38.235
Get back to your room!

45:38.236 --> 45:39.986
Mom and Dad
are getting a divorce!

45:39.987 --> 45:41.613
Shhhh! Be quiet!

45:41.614 --> 45:43.615
What do you
want me to do?

45:43.616 --> 45:45.909
I don't know, OK?

45:45.910 --> 45:48.203
I have to go.

45:48.204 --> 45:49.496
I can't take the kids.

45:49.497 --> 45:50.998
They need stability.

45:53.042 --> 45:54.292
And we need some privacy.

45:54.293 --> 45:56.503
Ohh!

45:56.504 --> 46:00.298
So that's what this is about!

46:00.299 --> 46:03.802
You want a new life
with your new girlfriend!

46:04.512 --> 46:05.971
No worries, Dad.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.225
I don't care about you either.

46:11.185 --> 46:13.020
Paige, hon! I didn't -

46:16.315 --> 46:17.983
Are you happy now?

47:08.867 --> 47:10.453
Hey, Paige!

47:10.995 --> 47:12.497
Hey.

47:13.872 --> 47:15.458
Are you OK?

47:20.837 --> 47:22.130
What happened?

47:22.131 --> 47:24.549
Lili,
I know you're trying to help,

47:24.550 --> 47:26.384
but I really need you
not to say anything and

47:26.385 --> 47:28.137
walk away right now.

47:30.264 --> 47:32.057
OK.

47:52.662 --> 47:54.288
Did you warm up?

47:57.375 --> 47:59.459
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

47:59.460 --> 48:02.004
Mariam, help Paige fix her hair.

48:03.255 --> 48:04.757
OK.

48:24.569 --> 48:26.195
That's OK. Thank you.

48:27.405 --> 48:29.114
Should I find Glenn?

48:29.866 --> 48:31.367
Everything is fine.

50:19.308 --> 50:21.559
So, there's food in the fridge,

50:21.560 --> 50:23.812
and Alex goes to bed around ten.

50:23.813 --> 50:27.148
- Uhm...
- Yes, no worries.

50:27.149 --> 50:29.233
Sorry, I just
wanna to go over everything...

50:29.234 --> 50:32.613
This is... the first time I've
left my kids with a babysitter.

50:33.698 --> 50:35.365
Totally understand.

50:35.366 --> 50:36.533
And what about-

50:36.534 --> 50:38.117
Oh... Paige.

50:38.118 --> 50:39.619
Ahh... she's meeting
with her math tutor tonight,

50:39.620 --> 50:42.206
so you don't have to worry
about her.

51:31.213 --> 51:32.422
Hey, honey...

51:32.423 --> 51:34.258
is everything OK in there?

51:38.596 --> 51:40.179
It's fine, Mom.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.724
I'm studying.

51:45.728 --> 51:46.687
OK, well...

51:46.688 --> 51:48.354
I'm going out, and...

51:48.355 --> 51:50.566
Sarah's watching Alex.

51:56.488 --> 51:58.240
Sounds good.

52:02.494 --> 52:03.996
OK.

52:23.724 --> 52:25.140
Hello.

52:25.141 --> 52:26.727
Hey! How was it?

52:29.438 --> 52:31.773
I feel like a fool
for even trying.

52:31.774 --> 52:32.983
Woah-woah-woah...

52:32.984 --> 52:34.067
It couldn't be that bad.

52:34.068 --> 52:36.611
No... no...

52:36.612 --> 52:37.989
It was that bad.

52:39.197 --> 52:40.573
You know what?

52:40.574 --> 52:42.199
We're having a party
at my place.

52:42.200 --> 52:43.367
You should come over!

52:43.368 --> 52:44.661
Yeah. A party...

52:44.662 --> 52:47.914
That's exactly what
I need right now.

52:47.915 --> 52:50.625
Come on, Paige.
It's better than crying on

52:50.626 --> 52:53.003
the floor of your bedroom.

52:53.004 --> 52:55.047
Forget about
dancing for a night!

52:56.882 --> 52:58.759
I've had such a long day.

53:00.344 --> 53:01.971
Don't be like that.

53:07.183 --> 53:08.769
OK.

53:10.646 --> 53:12.148
What time?

53:35.129 --> 53:39.341
One, two... three.

53:46.598 --> 53:48.142
Paige?

53:49.351 --> 53:50.935
Hey!

53:50.936 --> 53:52.729
I'm here... for the party.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.647
I'm Dylan's friend.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.400
I know. Come in.

54:05.409 --> 54:06.952
I didn't catch your name...

54:07.828 --> 54:09.244
I didn't give it to you.

54:09.245 --> 54:10.748
I'm Kate.

54:12.124 --> 54:14.250
Nice to meet you.

54:15.502 --> 54:17.212
We have science together.

54:17.213 --> 54:18.964
I'm so sorry.

54:20.382 --> 54:21.716
No problem.

54:21.717 --> 54:24.386
I'm just messing with you.
Let's go.

54:45.281 --> 54:46.991
Oh, hi!

54:46.992 --> 54:48.283
Lynda! You showed up!

54:48.284 --> 54:50.369
Yeah... I...
decided to join the crowd.

54:50.370 --> 54:51.829
I'm so glad you did!

54:51.830 --> 54:53.414
You need a drink!

54:53.415 --> 54:54.540
And I need one too.

54:54.541 --> 54:56.291
We have a table right here.

54:56.292 --> 54:57.920
Oh... great.

54:59.922 --> 55:02.132
I can't believe
you're actually here!

55:02.133 --> 55:03.758
I can't believe it either.

55:03.759 --> 55:05.300
I mean, I left my kids at
home with a babysitter-

55:05.301 --> 55:07.511
No talk about kids
or husbands tonight.

55:07.512 --> 55:08.889
We need drinks.

55:10.390 --> 55:12.142
Hi. Can I get a martini, please.

55:12.143 --> 55:13.602
Shots!

55:15.311 --> 55:17.188
Here's to us!

55:17.189 --> 55:18.690
To us.

55:24.571 --> 55:25.989
Let's dance.

55:25.990 --> 55:27.407
OK.

55:44.842 --> 55:46.426
This is for you.

55:47.052 --> 55:49.512
Thanks.

55:49.513 --> 55:51.181
Don't worry. It's just punch.

55:51.182 --> 55:52.683
We have a no alcohol policy.

55:53.142 --> 55:55.685
Oh.

55:55.686 --> 55:58.521

I heard you wanted one.

57:48.590 --> 57:50.550
Umm... I didn't catch your name.

57:53.637 --> 57:56.223
Well, that's because
I didn't give it to you.

57:57.474 --> 57:59.601
Uh. Fair enough.

58:01.353 --> 58:03.314
You really should.

58:03.981 --> 58:05.982
I'm Miranda.

58:05.983 --> 58:07.733
Miranda...

58:07.734 --> 58:09.486
George.

58:12.614 --> 58:14.283
It's nice to meet you, George.

58:15.909 --> 58:17.827
You are very beautiful.

58:17.828 --> 58:21.206
Thank you. Thanks...

58:22.958 --> 58:25.709
Do you wanna dance?

58:25.710 --> 58:28.672
- Yes.
- OK... OK!

58:37.806 --> 58:40.099
Look at you! You look great!

58:40.100 --> 58:41.434
Thanks.

58:41.435 --> 58:43.978
Your singing was... lovely.

58:47.274 --> 58:49.485
I mean... It was great.

58:51.111 --> 58:53.321
Thanks.

58:53.322 --> 58:56.949
Are you... Do you write music?

58:56.950 --> 59:00.204
Yeah, I'm trying... I have a
couple of songs that I'm proud of.

59:00.745 --> 59:01.871
Oh, cool.

59:01.872 --> 59:04.749
- Nice song.
- Ah, thanks, Kate.

59:06.584 --> 59:08.336
You met Paige, right?

59:08.337 --> 59:09.712
We're in the same class.

59:09.713 --> 59:11.256
That's right...

59:15.886 --> 59:17.679

Nuh-uh.

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:10.106
Hey, have you seen my friend?

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:11.899
Umm... Which one?

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:15.278
Brown hair, dress.

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:18.198
I think she left,
but honestly, I'm not sure.

01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:20.534
Oh, OK. Thanks.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:45.308
Oh... Umm. I...

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:47.810
I don't think I can do this.
I'm sorry.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.395
You... You were just in it...
just a second ago!

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:52.856
Umm... The thing. I'm married!

01:00:52.857 --> 01:00:54.775
I don't care!

01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:57.570
But... really.
I'm uncomf... I'm uncomfortable.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:00.282
Can you just... Can you
please, just get off me!?

01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:04.327
Ooh. I... I'm so sorry.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.996
The door was open.

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:33.398
Paige!

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.775
Where are you going?

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:39.112
It's just getting late.

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:44.200
You were just gonna leave
without saying good bye?

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:47.204
You should go back...
to your friends.

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.211
My mom doesn't know I'm here,

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:56.587
and I really don't wanna

01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:58.048
get in trouble tonight.

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:03.928
And that's the only reason
why you're leaving?

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.474
Uh-huh.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.810
You should've said bye.

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:15.649
Bye.

01:02:28.786 --> 01:02:30.372
Paige?

01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:33.083
I know you snuck out.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:36.335
Well, you'd better keep it
between us.

01:02:36.336 --> 01:02:38.880
You aren't even
supposed to be awake.

01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:56.040
How are you doing there?

01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:02.088
I just don't understand this.

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:12.973
I can help if you want.

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:17.227
Nah... I've spent
three hours trying.

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:19.481
I'm done for today.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.108
You should go let Mom know.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:27.238
Oh no. Thank you, but no.

01:04:28.657 --> 01:04:30.366
The second she finds out,

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.161
you'll get the focus
of attention.

01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:37.874
You know how fun that could be?

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.293
Mh-mm.

01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:56.892
Yesterday was awful.

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:59.478
I can't believe they're
gonna get divorced.

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:01.272
You don't know that!

01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:11.031
Alex, I'll always be around.

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:14.159
Till you're gone
with your stupid ballet.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.830
Hey! I mean it.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:20.333
I'll always be here for you.

01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:25.004
Promise?

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:28.007
I promise.

01:05:53.991 --> 01:05:55.201
Hi, everyone.

01:06:08.005 --> 01:06:09.674
You're early today.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.262
Stand up.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.393
Do a triple pirouette.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:22.895
I haven't warmed up yet.

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:26.274
That hasn't stop you before.
Let's see it.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.700
Again.

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:43.792
Again!

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:53.968
That's right!

01:06:53.969 --> 01:06:56.846
See, you are capable of it!

01:06:56.847 --> 01:06:58.181
Easily!

01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:00.850
I'm sorry.

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:03.602
I don't know what happened
at the audition.

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:07.482
Being a performer means
nothing will distract you!

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.108
I understand.

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:12.195
Take your place at the barre.

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:37.178
So... you left your
clutch last night.

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:45.769
Look at you,
all shiny and bright.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:48.105
You sound like you're
in your late forties.

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:53.485
Come on!
So, did he take you home or...

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:56.113
It didn't go any further.

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:04.747
Seriously... what's going on?

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:09.251
Well, I'm thirty six, and
texting my soon-to-be ex-husband

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:13.005
after the worst
night of my life.

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:14.549
No offense.

01:08:17.886 --> 01:08:20.888
And I'm trying to figure out
what to do with my teenage

01:08:20.889 --> 01:08:24.767
daughter, who thinks she has
everything figured out.

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:26.394
Well, do you?

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:28.604
What?

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:32.274
Do you have everything
figured out?

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.194
You wouldn't understand.
You don't have kids.

01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:39.865
No, but I have a mom.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:42.451
I mean it took us a while
before we were able to have

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:44.370
any kind of a relationship.

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.292
You can't always expect things
to turn out exactly

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:52.545
as you planned them.

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:59.175
I'm just so afraid
of being alone.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:05.140
Derek and I have been going together
since our freshman year of college.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.143
I've always been with him...

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:13.189
and I don't know
who I am without him.

01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:22.783
Well... Maybe, this is your
chance to find out who you are.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:26.871
Yeah, I'm just not sure if
I'm ready to let him go.

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:33.127
I still hope that I can
fix it somehow.

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:38.591
Not everything can be fixed.
Sometimes we have to let go.

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:46.932
I have to get to a meeting.
If you ever need to talk...

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:49.518
you know where my office is.

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:51.395
Thank you, Jessica.

01:10:09.413 --> 01:10:15.045
Paige! Come here.
Follow me to my office.

01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:24.553
You look different.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:26.180
How so?

01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:28.933
It looks like you've lost
a lot of weight.

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:32.519
That's a good thing, right?

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.605
Do you think that's good?

01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:38.317
Tell me, what have you eaten?

01:10:40.195 --> 01:10:45.074
Umm... carrots, I've been
eating a lot of vegetables.

01:10:45.075 --> 01:10:46.784
For every meal?

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:52.664
I... I don't know.
I don't remember.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:55.291
Paige.

01:10:55.292 --> 01:10:57.627
I'm just not hungry.

01:10:57.628 --> 01:10:59.796
Do you feel you need
to loose weight?

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:05.469
No! No...
I'm not doing it on purpose.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:13.019
My family... I can't eat.

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:18.024
Go grab some food,
and come back to the studio.

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:22.779
Paige, I'm serious.

01:11:26.074 --> 01:11:31.203

You're welcome.
Finally, you decided to join us.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:52.326
How is work?

01:12:52.327 --> 01:12:54.620
Paying the bills.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:03.629
So... I wanted to talk to you
about my trip to San Francisco.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:09.843
Since I'm back to straight As,
I thought it would be

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:11.594
a good time to talk about it.

01:13:11.595 --> 01:13:15.350
I don't recall talking about
San Francisco at all.

01:13:16.433 --> 01:13:18.601
The company I want
to get into is

01:13:18.602 --> 01:13:20.271
San Francisco Ballet Theater.

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:25.651
I thought we already discussed
dance and your future.

01:13:27.611 --> 01:13:30.740
You said that when
my grades improved...

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:33.783
that we could talk-Alex!

01:13:33.784 --> 01:13:37.371
I'm trying to talk to Mom!
What are you doing?

01:13:37.372 --> 01:13:40.916
Dancing! Mom told me even
a monkey could do it.

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:50.051
It takes so much,
and you never get it.

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:53.137
You're right. We are done here.

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:55.890
Hey! Plate, please!

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.560
Don't forget about
your school trip!

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:32.426
Alex! Alex!

01:14:32.427 --> 01:14:34.094
What did Paige do now?

01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:36.263
Did you see your sister
this morning?

01:14:36.264 --> 01:14:38.515
Yes, she left around nine.

01:14:39.516 --> 01:14:40.935

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:06.687
I am not going to repeat myself.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:11.941
Let's go!

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:14.110
Did I tell you to stop?
And! Plié!

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:15.945
Mom! Stop!

01:16:15.946 --> 01:16:18.740
We're leaving right now, I-

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:21.368
don't even have words!
What are you even doing here?

01:16:21.369 --> 01:16:24.620
I tried talking to you
last night.

01:16:24.621 --> 01:16:26.498
You don't even listen to me!

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:28.750
I need to practice
for San Francisco.

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:33.213
I've never even heard about an audition
in San Francisco before last night.

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:35.631
And if I had,
I would've said "No".

01:16:35.632 --> 01:16:38.885
Mom... You promised me!

01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:43.014
You said if I improve my
grades, and I did.

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:46.435
I never promised, I said we'd
talk about it, and we did...

01:16:46.436 --> 01:16:47.602
last night.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:49.188
Talk?

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:53.483
You didn't even hear me out!

01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:55.068
You lied to me.

01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:57.653
Oh! Well you want
to talk about lying?

01:16:57.654 --> 01:16:59.906
OK! Let's talk about lying.

01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:01.783
Don't change
the subject!

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:03.910
Michael! Focus, please.

01:17:03.911 --> 01:17:06.662
I told you I need
to practice for San Francisco!

01:17:06.663 --> 01:17:12.043
I also need a lot of things
in this world! Do I get it? No.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:15.213
You didn't get into the company,
you already auditioned for,

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:18.758
so why waste time on another!

01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:21.261
That audition...
doesn't even matter!

01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:25.056
I will get into the
San Francisco Ballet Theater.

01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:28.518
Oh, honey.

01:17:28.519 --> 01:17:32.897
This was very cute when you
were a kid, but now...

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:35.151
this is just pathetic.

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:38.613
Pathetic?

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:45.535
Not as pathetic as you...
controlling my life

01:17:45.536 --> 01:17:47.538
because you have nothing left.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:01.259
I'm in the middle of class,
this is not the place!

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:03.136
We're leaving. Now.

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:05.680
- We need to talk.
- No. We don't.

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:09.559
She's not allowed to be here.
End of conversation.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.853
Paige has an important
audition, coming up Sunday...

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:15.231
Yes, in San Francisco, which
she will be not be attending!

01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:16.608
Are you ready?

01:18:16.609 --> 01:18:19.820
Grab your stuff,
drive straight home!

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.157
So nice to see you!

01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:44.052
I need your keys!

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:47.138
Yeah, that's right. You're
losing your car privileges.

01:18:47.139 --> 01:18:49.599
And how am I supposed
to get to school?

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.934
I'll drive you.

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:52.936
Great.

01:18:56.691 --> 01:18:59.151
Whoops... sorry.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:08.410
Paige, you were wrong.
You went behind my back.

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:11.954
At least I don't make promises
I can't keep.

01:19:11.955 --> 01:19:17.043
No... Wait, you just
didn't want to keep them.

01:19:17.044 --> 01:19:19.379
I'm not going to discuss
this with you again.

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:20.838
Dad promised me!

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:24.092
I honestly don't care
what Dad promised.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:27.137
Dad's not here, and I am.

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:48.908
Hey, Paige! Good
to hear from you, hon.

01:19:48.909 --> 01:19:54.414
Dad, I need your help.

01:19:54.415 --> 01:19:57.793
Paige, I'm sorry.
I can't-

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:05.217
Paige? Paige!
Are you still there?

01:20:18.606 --> 01:20:25.445
Paige? Breakfast.
Paige, I know you're awake.

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:30.117
How many times do we have to-

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:40.710
I'm sorry, Mom.
I had to go.

01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:44.547
I have to follow my dream
because dance is my passion.

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:48.926
Please, just try to understand,
I'm not trying to hurt you,

01:20:48.927 --> 01:20:52.972
but nothing else makes me feel
the same way when I'm on stage.

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:58.145
I'll see you when I get back
from San Francisco. Love you.

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:08.530
Where is Paige? She
doesn't want breakfast again?

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:11.991
Honey, shhh...
just eat your food.

01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:16.997
Come on, Paige!

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:21.501
Mom, did Paige go somewhere?

01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:24.045
Alex! Eat, please.

01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:29.384
Derek, how dare you do
something without consulting me!

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:32.847
Lynda, if it's about
Paige, I totally took your side.

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:15.346
Look who's awake!

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:16.891
Thanks.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.436
Good reflexes.

01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:24.313
Where are we?

01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:27.358
Oh you know...
just the middle of nowhere.

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:29.611
So that means...

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:32.488
A couple of hours away
from San Francisco.

01:22:32.489 --> 01:22:34.116

Luke, remember to connect
your passé-

01:24:29.523 --> 01:24:31.567
Who do you think you are!

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:42.160
Keep doing what you're doing.
I'll be right back.

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:07.770
Christina Kilroy?

01:25:08.729 --> 01:25:10.439
Let's go.

01:25:22.701 --> 01:25:24.368
How can I help you, Lynda?

01:25:24.369 --> 01:25:28.039
Paige is in San Francisco,
and it's all your fault.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.043
How is it my fault exactly?
Paige made her own choices-

01:25:32.044 --> 01:25:35.129
She's seventeen!
She doesn't know what she wants!

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:37.632
And she is not allowed to make
the choice to run away.

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:42.804
You're the one who put these ideas into
Paige's head about being a ballerina.

01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:47.601
Deluding her into thinking that
she has a future in it.

01:25:48.936 --> 01:25:51.647
When was the last time you
saw Paige dance?

01:25:55.651 --> 01:25:58.654
When she was little.

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:03.240
Let me show you something.

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:06.078
I don't want to see anything.
I just came here to-

01:26:12.126 --> 01:26:14.710
I don't even know why I'm here.

01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:18.632
Since you're already here,
just watch it.

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:49.908
That was beautiful,
but it doesn't change anything.

01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:57.666
Come with me.

01:29:23.441 --> 01:29:27.069
We would like to see
how you look together.

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:30.157
Please take the stage.

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:06.193
I have many really
promising dancers.

01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:09.445
Paige has the potential
to be great.

01:30:11.365 --> 01:30:14.449
It's beautiful.

01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:18.038
But I just don't want her
to be disappointed later.

01:30:18.955 --> 01:30:21.375
We all have regrets.

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:26.629
I'm sorry I have to go.

01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:43.729
So... how does it feel
to be so great?

01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:49.526
Good. It feels really,
really good.

01:30:49.527 --> 01:30:52.071
Well, you're not the only
one with some great news...

01:30:52.072 --> 01:30:54.282
Oh yeah?

01:30:54.283 --> 01:30:55.824
I got into a music program.

01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:57.618
What? Where?

01:30:57.619 --> 01:30:58.994
L.A.

01:30:58.995 --> 01:31:02.624
Dylan! That's amazing!
Congratulations!

01:31:06.336 --> 01:31:09.631
- Thank you.
- For what?

01:31:11.258 --> 01:31:15.469
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't even be here.

01:31:16.138 --> 01:31:17.721
I know.

01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:19.472
I'm serious!

01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:22.559
Looks like you owe me a trip
to the Grand Canyon.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.729
Really? You are still going
on about that?

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:46.209
So... you're back.

01:31:49.712 --> 01:31:52.257
Yes... I am.

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.637
Crap.

01:31:58.888 --> 01:32:01.098
I thought you'd be at work.

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:03.267
Well, I took the day off,
since you said you'd be

01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:05.436
home this morning.

01:32:05.437 --> 01:32:07.272
Dylan just dropped me off.

01:32:07.856 --> 01:32:10.274
The tutor?

01:32:10.275 --> 01:32:11.734
He's a friend.

01:32:14.029 --> 01:32:15.655
How did the audition go?

01:32:19.617 --> 01:32:21.203
It went really well.

01:32:25.874 --> 01:32:28.626
Did you get in?

01:32:36.092 --> 01:32:37.844
Congratulations.

01:32:39.388 --> 01:32:41.514
Thanks.

01:32:41.515 --> 01:32:43.766
Glenn showed me your
audition piece-

01:32:44.767 --> 01:32:47.269
You went to the studio?

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:51.982
Oh yeah, and I made a huge
scene. Not proud of it.

01:32:56.363 --> 01:33:02.160
But he showed me your video,
and you're very talented, Paige.

01:33:11.961 --> 01:33:13.629
Thanks, Mom.

01:33:17.467 --> 01:33:19.343
Did you like California?

01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:24.015
It was a bit colder, but I could
see myself living there.

01:33:28.144 --> 01:33:31.147
So am I grounded for life?

01:33:32.107 --> 01:33:34.816
No.

01:33:34.817 --> 01:33:37.694
But there is some immediate
babysitting in your future

01:33:37.695 --> 01:33:39.530
as punishment.

01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:41.157
That sounds fair.

01:33:42.951 --> 01:33:44.034
Do we have anything to eat?

01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:46.413
Oh yeah. Go help yourself.

01:33:50.292 --> 01:33:53.210
I actually have to get going,

01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:59.216
so your punishment starts now,
and Alex is in his room.

01:33:59.217 --> 01:34:01.052
Where are you going?

01:34:03.930 --> 01:34:05.639
I have to meet someone.

01:34:09.352 --> 01:34:11.563
I'm really glad you're home.

01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:22.114
Paige!

01:34:22.115 --> 01:34:24.618
- What's up?
- I missed you.

01:34:27.621 --> 01:34:28.829
I missed you too.

01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:29.997
Paige...

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:31.873
Yes?

01:34:31.874 --> 01:34:33.834
Will you show me how you dance?

01:34:33.835 --> 01:34:36.295
What?

01:34:36.296 --> 01:34:41.133
Mom won't stop talking how good
you are. I wanna see.

01:34:41.134 --> 01:34:43.845
All right! Let's go!

01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:51.019
If you have any
questions, please just ask.

01:34:52.395 --> 01:34:55.147
I think my client's offer
is more than fair-

01:34:55.148 --> 01:34:56.773
I can read, you know.

01:34:56.774 --> 01:34:58.984
I can't believe
this is finally happening.

01:34:58.985 --> 01:35:02.488
Did you change your mind
because I backed you up?

01:35:02.489 --> 01:35:05.740
I mean, I never really cared
about the ballet, I just-

01:35:05.741 --> 01:35:09.244
Well, I guess after you leaving
and Paige running away,

01:35:09.245 --> 01:35:14.291
I finally understood one thing.
I don't need someone in my life

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:18.795
or in my kids' lives who would
rather think about himself

01:35:18.796 --> 01:35:21.174
than support his own children.

01:35:26.804 --> 01:35:29.641
I am happy to be free of you,
Derek.

01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:32.352
Have a great life.

01:35:43.988 --> 01:35:45.323
First position.

01:35:54.123 --> 01:35:55.500
Turning.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.003
Not bad!

01:36:01.506 --> 01:36:03.633
Oh gosh, oh gosh!

01:36:04.967 --> 01:36:06.636
