WEBVTT

04:21.603 --> 04:22.970
<i>Your Grace.</i>

04:23.072 --> 04:26.707
The trial will be getting under way soon.

04:59.141 --> 05:00.541
You got my money?

05:00.643 --> 05:02.943
Later.
Go away.

05:14.223 --> 05:16.056
Grand Maester.

05:56.465 --> 05:58.932
Ser Loras Tyrell.

06:00.770 --> 06:03.504
Are you prepared to stand trial

06:03.606 --> 06:07.307
and profess your guilt or
innocence before the Seven?

06:09.912 --> 06:12.312
There'll be no need for a trial.

06:14.817 --> 06:17.217
I confess before the Seven

06:17.319 --> 06:19.319
and freely admit to my crimes.

06:20.823 --> 06:23.557
To which crimes will you be confessing?

06:23.659 --> 06:25.993
All of them.

06:27.730 --> 06:29.430
I lay with other men

06:29.532 --> 06:32.966
including the traitor Renly Baratheon.

06:36.472 --> 06:39.239
<i>I perjured myself before the gods.</i>

06:39.341 --> 06:41.642
I am guilty of depravity...

06:43.145 --> 06:45.145
dishonesty,

06:45.247 --> 06:46.714
profligacy,

06:46.816 --> 06:49.683
<i>and arrogance.</i>

06:49.785 --> 06:51.218
I see that now.

06:53.589 --> 06:55.823
I humble myself before the Seven

06:55.925 --> 06:59.326
and accept whatever punishment
the gods deem just.

07:01.363 --> 07:06.233
The gods' judgment is fierce,

07:06.335 --> 07:08.869
but also fair.

07:08.971 --> 07:12.339
The Warrior punishes those
who believe themselves

07:12.441 --> 07:14.708
beyond the reach of justice.

07:16.212 --> 07:19.279
But the Mother shows her mercy

07:19.381 --> 07:23.183
to those who kneel before her.

07:31.227 --> 07:33.927
<i>I take full
responsibility for my many sins</i>

07:34.029 --> 07:36.530
and unburden myself of my desires.

07:40.002 --> 07:42.936
My only remaining wish

07:43.038 --> 07:45.639
is to devote my life to the Seven.

07:45.741 --> 07:48.809
<i>May I be a living example
of their grace</i>

07:48.911 --> 07:51.578
<i>for others to witness.</i>

07:53.149 --> 07:56.617
You understand fully

07:56.719 --> 07:58.552
what this means?

07:58.654 --> 08:00.154
I do.

08:02.725 --> 08:04.858
I will abandon the Tyrell name

08:04.960 --> 08:07.995
and all that goes with it.

08:08.097 --> 08:11.865
I will renounce my lordship
and my claims on Highgarden.

08:15.504 --> 08:17.738
I will never marry

08:17.840 --> 08:20.240
and I will never father children.

08:23.813 --> 08:25.779
<i>Brother Loras...</i>

08:25.881 --> 08:30.651
...I ask you to dedicate
your life to the seven gods.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.691
Will you fight to defend your faith

08:37.793 --> 08:40.227
against heretics and apostates?

08:40.328 --> 08:41.828
I will.

09:11.026 --> 09:12.192
No, I can't let them...

09:12.294 --> 09:15.262
Faith is the way, Father.

09:37.820 --> 09:38.986
All right.

09:40.222 --> 09:41.922
I'm ready.

09:49.365 --> 09:51.865
I have to go.
I'm...

09:51.967 --> 09:53.901
I'm late for the trial.

10:07.049 --> 10:09.149
<i>You mutilated him.</i>

10:09.251 --> 10:11.151
You gave me your word.

10:11.253 --> 10:13.620
And I have kept my word.

10:13.722 --> 10:16.490
<i>Once the queen mother's
trial is concluded,</i>

10:16.592 --> 10:18.625
<i>Brother Loras is free to leave.</i>

10:18.727 --> 10:20.627
And where is the queen mother?

10:20.729 --> 10:23.997
Her litter never left the Red Keep.

10:24.099 --> 10:28.035
It appears the queen mother doesn't
wish to attend her own trial.

10:30.439 --> 10:33.106
Go to the Red Keep
and show her the way.

10:59.969 --> 11:01.735
Get the others.

11:43.779 --> 11:45.712
Where's the king?

11:48.684 --> 11:50.617
Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

11:50.719 --> 11:52.352
What's the meaning of this?

11:52.454 --> 11:54.321
I was told that...

11:54.423 --> 11:55.889
ah.

11:55.991 --> 11:58.091
I have more important
things to do with my time

11:58.193 --> 11:59.559
than waste them in the presence...

11:59.661 --> 12:02.329
Please, Grand Maester.
I bear you no ill will.

12:03.799 --> 12:06.133
Please forgive me if you can.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.033
This pains me, my lord.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.202
Whatever your faults,
you do not deserve

12:42.304 --> 12:45.272
to die alone in such
a cold, dark place.

12:45.374 --> 12:49.109
But sometimes before
we can usher in the new,

12:49.211 --> 12:53.346
the old must be put to rest.

13:34.523 --> 13:37.624
The longer you wait,
the worse it'll be for you.

14:04.586 --> 14:06.620
What are you doing?

15:13.989 --> 15:16.056
There's something wrong.

15:16.158 --> 15:18.625
You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.

15:18.727 --> 15:20.594
The trial will begin shortly.

15:20.696 --> 15:23.396
Cersei is not here.
Tommen is not here.

15:23.498 --> 15:24.858
Why do you think they're not here?

15:24.933 --> 15:26.766
If the accused is not here,

15:26.868 --> 15:28.935
she will be tried regardless.

15:29.037 --> 15:31.271
We cannot escape
the justice of the gods...

15:31.373 --> 15:34.007
Forget about the bloody gods and
listen to what I'm telling you.

15:34.109 --> 15:37.544
Cersei understands the
consequences of her absence

15:37.646 --> 15:39.412
and she is absent anyway,

15:39.514 --> 15:43.383
which means she does not intend
to suffer those consequences.

15:43.485 --> 15:47.354
The trial can wait.
We all need to leave.

16:13.148 --> 16:15.248
We all need to leave now.

16:19.888 --> 16:22.656
Loras.

16:22.758 --> 16:24.924
Stay with me.

16:37.372 --> 16:40.173
Let me through.
Let me through.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.344
<i>Get out of my way.</i>

16:52.654 --> 16:54.587
Let us through.

18:24.045 --> 18:26.079
<i>Confess.</i>

18:28.250 --> 18:30.216
<i>Confess.</i>

18:34.556 --> 18:36.556
- No.
- Confess.

18:46.168 --> 18:49.002
Confess.
It felt good.

18:49.104 --> 18:52.806
Beating me, starving me,

18:52.908 --> 18:55.809
frightening me, humiliating me.

18:58.814 --> 19:01.581
<i>You didn't do it because
you cared about my atonement.</i>

19:01.683 --> 19:04.818
You did it because it felt good.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.153
<i>I understand.</i>

19:07.255 --> 19:10.423
I do things because they feel good.

19:13.395 --> 19:16.729
I drink because it feels good.

19:16.832 --> 19:20.934
I killed my husband because it
felt good to be rid of him.

19:24.272 --> 19:29.242
I fuck my brother because it feels
good to feel him inside me.

19:29.344 --> 19:31.411
I lie about fucking my brother...

19:33.448 --> 19:37.450
because it feels good to keep our
son safe from hateful hypocrites.

19:40.255 --> 19:42.021
I killed your High Sparrow...

19:43.992 --> 19:46.159
<i>and all his little sparrows...</i>

19:47.829 --> 19:51.097
all his septons, all his septas,

19:51.199 --> 19:54.033
all his filthy soldiers,

19:54.135 --> 19:57.337
because it felt good
to watch them burn.

19:59.174 --> 20:03.009
It felt good to imagine
their shock and their pain.

20:03.111 --> 20:06.446
No thought has ever
given me greater joy.

20:12.153 --> 20:15.655
Even confessing feels good
under the right circumstances.

20:21.830 --> 20:23.863
You've always been quiet.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.807
I said my face would be the last
thing you saw before you died.

20:34.910 --> 20:36.976
Do you remember?

20:37.078 --> 20:39.045
Good.

20:41.316 --> 20:43.583
I'm glad to see your face.

20:46.488 --> 20:48.421
I'm ready to meet the gods.

20:48.523 --> 20:49.856
What?

20:51.860 --> 20:53.793
Now?

20:53.895 --> 20:55.361
Today?

20:58.433 --> 21:00.867
You're not going to die today.

21:03.371 --> 21:05.838
You're not going to die
for quite a while.

21:08.276 --> 21:10.243
Ser Gregor.

21:14.282 --> 21:16.549
<i>This is Ser Gregor Clegane.</i>

21:16.651 --> 21:19.252
He's quiet, too.

21:30.365 --> 21:31.998
Your gods have forsaken you.

21:33.234 --> 21:35.368
This is your god now.

21:46.581 --> 21:48.381
No.

21:49.484 --> 21:50.650
No.

21:52.187 --> 21:55.421
Shame.

21:55.523 --> 21:58.758
Shame.

21:58.860 --> 22:02.562
Shame.

22:07.469 --> 22:09.969
<i>I'm very sorry, Your Grace.</i>

22:11.506 --> 22:13.272
Very sorry.

22:57.052 --> 22:59.419
<i>For House Lannister!</i>

22:59.521 --> 23:01.454
<i>Hear me roar!</i>

23:07.095 --> 23:09.295
For House Frey!

23:09.397 --> 23:12.465
We stand together!

23:12.567 --> 23:15.435
May we stand together
through the centuries,

23:15.537 --> 23:18.004
good friends to the last.

23:18.106 --> 23:22.141
And when we drive our swords
through our enemies' hearts,

23:22.243 --> 23:26.045
may we speak the words
of our alliance,

23:26.147 --> 23:29.549
"The Freys and the Lannisters

23:29.651 --> 23:31.851
send their regards."

23:49.170 --> 23:51.671
You don't even have
to do anything, do you?

23:53.074 --> 23:55.341
You just sit there,
a rich slab of beef,

23:55.443 --> 23:56.876
and all the birds come pecking.

23:56.978 --> 23:59.378
- You're welcome to her.
- She doesn't want me.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.881
She wants your golden
fingers up her twat.

24:03.752 --> 24:05.852
Those two have their eyes on you.

24:08.022 --> 24:09.722
They have their eyes on you, cunt.

24:09.824 --> 24:11.624
Not my type.

24:11.726 --> 24:13.292
Not blonde enough?

24:15.764 --> 24:19.198
Ladies, have you met
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

24:19.300 --> 24:21.467
hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?

24:21.569 --> 24:23.936
- There you go.
- Maybe I'm not in the mood.

24:27.208 --> 24:28.741
Fuck it.

24:28.843 --> 24:32.011
No need to call me ser just
because I'm an anointed knight.

24:37.318 --> 24:39.752
This came together rather well.

24:41.489 --> 24:43.656
Your father would be pleased.

24:43.758 --> 24:45.424
I'm sure he would be.

24:48.062 --> 24:50.897
Edmure is back in a cell.

24:50.999 --> 24:54.634
Can't go killing my son by law.
It wouldn't be right.

24:54.736 --> 24:56.903
Give the family a bad name.

25:00.375 --> 25:04.310
So the famous Blackfish
killed by foot soldiers, eh?

25:04.412 --> 25:07.313
Legendary warrior, everyone said.

25:08.783 --> 25:11.083
Have you done much fighting
yourself, Lord Frey?

25:11.186 --> 25:13.719
I'm a bit old for all that.

25:13.822 --> 25:16.522
No, but back in your day.

25:16.624 --> 25:19.559
The purpose of fighting

25:19.661 --> 25:22.862
is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

25:22.964 --> 25:24.964
I've defeated mine.

25:25.066 --> 25:28.768
Riverrun belonged to House
Tully for a thousand years.

25:28.870 --> 25:30.436
Now it's mine.

25:30.538 --> 25:32.839
What do you call that?

25:32.941 --> 25:34.207
Victory.

25:34.309 --> 25:36.809
Yes, you're a great conqueror.

25:38.413 --> 25:42.181
Go on, mock me, boy.
You think I mind?

25:42.283 --> 25:45.017
The Tullys mocked me for years.

25:45.119 --> 25:47.286
The Starks mocked me.

25:47.388 --> 25:48.855
Where are they now?

25:48.957 --> 25:51.424
<i>You talk about war
as if you're an expert,</i>

25:51.526 --> 25:53.826
but the one battle
I remember you fighting,

25:53.928 --> 25:56.829
you were captured by Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

25:56.931 --> 25:59.832
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

25:59.934 --> 26:03.269
Here we are now, two kingslayers.

26:03.371 --> 26:07.240
We know what it's like to
have them grovel to our faces

26:07.342 --> 26:10.343
and snigger behind our backs.

26:10.445 --> 26:12.011
We don't mind, do we?

26:12.113 --> 26:16.082
Fear is a marvelous thing.

26:16.184 --> 26:17.783
They don't fear the Freys, though.

26:17.886 --> 26:20.620
They fear the Lannisters.

26:20.722 --> 26:23.089
We gave you the Riverlands
to hold the Riverlands.

26:23.191 --> 26:25.625
If we have to ride north
and take them back for you

26:25.727 --> 26:28.127
every time you lose them,

26:28.229 --> 26:30.196
why do we need you?

26:51.886 --> 26:53.552
Show me.

26:56.357 --> 26:58.324
Your Grace, there's no need...

26:58.426 --> 26:59.792
Show me.

27:12.707 --> 27:16.108
What are your thoughts
concerning the king's funeral?

27:16.210 --> 27:18.878
As the Sept of Baelor
is no longer an option,

27:18.980 --> 27:22.748
<i>perhaps a ceremony
in the throne room?</i>

27:24.218 --> 27:27.353
He should be with his grandfather,

27:27.455 --> 27:30.289
his brother, his sister.

27:32.727 --> 27:35.394
Burn him

27:35.496 --> 27:38.464
and bury his ashes
where the sept once stood.

27:51.079 --> 27:53.412
Whoa, whoa.

28:36.190 --> 28:37.556
Hello.

28:44.332 --> 28:48.034
From Lord Commander Snow
at Castle Black.

29:02.650 --> 29:04.917
I'm...

29:05.019 --> 29:06.519
I'm to be the new maester.

29:21.869 --> 29:23.002
Oh.

29:23.104 --> 29:25.504
According to our records,

29:25.606 --> 29:27.373
Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.

29:28.776 --> 29:30.509
He died.

29:30.611 --> 29:33.179
We received no report from
the maester at Castle Black.

29:33.281 --> 29:36.415
Maester Aemon became quite ill
shortly after the election.

29:36.517 --> 29:38.784
He's since passed away.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.922
Which is why I'm here.

29:46.294 --> 29:48.127
This is irregular.

29:48.229 --> 29:52.898
Yes, well, I suppose
that life is irregular.

30:04.479 --> 30:08.581
The archmaester will discuss
these irregularities with you.

30:11.152 --> 30:14.186
In the meantime, you are
permitted to use the library.

30:14.288 --> 30:16.155
Follow me.

30:19.127 --> 30:21.127
No women or children.

32:15.376 --> 32:17.676
When we had feasts,

32:17.778 --> 32:20.045
our family would sit up here...

32:22.049 --> 32:23.949
and I'd sit down there.

32:26.287 --> 32:28.854
Could have been worse, Jon Snow.

32:28.956 --> 32:30.723
You had a family.

32:30.825 --> 32:31.991
You had feasts.

32:34.161 --> 32:37.296
Aye, you're right.
I was luckier than most.

32:52.747 --> 32:54.413
What is that?

32:56.050 --> 32:57.983
Tell him.

33:01.022 --> 33:03.222
<i>Tell him who it belonged to.</i>

33:08.095 --> 33:09.695
The Princess Shireen.

33:09.797 --> 33:12.097
Tell him what you did to her.

33:13.968 --> 33:15.267
Tell him!

33:21.976 --> 33:23.676
We burned her at the stake.

33:36.824 --> 33:39.158
Why?

33:39.260 --> 33:42.361
The army was trapped.
The horses were dying.

33:42.463 --> 33:45.531
- It was the only way.
- You burned a little girl alive!

33:45.633 --> 33:47.066
I only do what my Lord commands.

33:47.168 --> 33:50.302
If he commands you to burn
children, your Lord is evil.

33:53.607 --> 33:55.307
We are standing here because of him.

33:56.811 --> 34:00.079
<i>Jon Snow is alive
because the Lord willed it.</i>

34:00.181 --> 34:03.782
I loved that girl
like she was my own.

34:03.884 --> 34:07.186
She was good. She was kind.
And you killed her!

34:09.389 --> 34:10.856
So did her father.

34:13.159 --> 34:14.626
So did her mother.

34:16.831 --> 34:19.063
<i>Her own blood knew
it was the only way.</i>

34:19.166 --> 34:21.766
The only way for what?

34:21.869 --> 34:23.369
They all died anyway.

34:25.239 --> 34:27.239
You told everyone
Stannis was the one.

34:27.341 --> 34:29.675
You had him believing it,
all of them fooled.

34:29.777 --> 34:32.244
- And you lied.
- I didn't lie.

34:33.981 --> 34:35.313
I was wrong.

34:35.416 --> 34:38.650
<i>Aye, you were wrong.</i>

34:38.753 --> 34:42.388
How many died because you were wrong?

34:47.360 --> 34:51.263
I ask your leave to execute
this woman for murder.

34:51.364 --> 34:53.165
<i>She admits to the crime.</i>

34:55.668 --> 34:58.070
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

34:59.940 --> 35:02.674
I've been ready
to die for many years.

35:04.478 --> 35:07.513
If the Lord was done with
me, so be it, but he's not.

35:07.615 --> 35:10.816
You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.

35:10.918 --> 35:14.186
You know the great war
is still to come.

35:14.288 --> 35:17.256
You know the army of the
dead will be upon us soon.

35:18.492 --> 35:21.059
And you know I can
help you win that war.

35:35.342 --> 35:37.209
Ride south today.

35:38.712 --> 35:40.612
If you return to the North,

35:40.714 --> 35:43.315
I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

36:01.068 --> 36:03.669
If you ever come back this way,

36:03.771 --> 36:06.138
I will execute you myself.

36:38.138 --> 36:40.939
I'm having the lord's
chamber prepared for you.

36:42.676 --> 36:44.710
Mother and Father's room?

36:46.180 --> 36:48.013
You should take it.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.383
I'm not a Stark.

36:51.485 --> 36:53.886
You are to me.

36:57.558 --> 36:59.224
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

36:59.326 --> 37:03.228
You deserve it. We're
standing here because of you.

37:03.330 --> 37:06.832
<i>The battle was lost until the
Knights of the Vale rode in.</i>

37:06.934 --> 37:09.134
They came because of you.

37:13.140 --> 37:16.074
You told me Lord Baelish
sold you to the Boltons.

37:16.176 --> 37:17.943
- He did.
- And you trust him?

37:18.045 --> 37:21.680
Only a fool
would trust Littlefinger.

37:24.818 --> 37:27.586
I should have told you about him,

37:27.688 --> 37:31.023
about the Knights of the Vale.

37:31.125 --> 37:32.591
I'm sorry.

37:43.904 --> 37:45.871
We need to trust each other.

37:45.973 --> 37:48.974
We can't fight a war
amongst ourselves.

37:49.076 --> 37:51.577
We have so many enemies now.

38:07.828 --> 38:09.861
Jon.

38:09.964 --> 38:13.398
A raven came from the Citadel.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.400
A white raven.

38:18.105 --> 38:19.638
Winter is here.

38:31.919 --> 38:35.053
Well, Father always
promised, didn't he?

38:49.136 --> 38:52.304
The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,

38:52.406 --> 38:54.506
he was assassinated.

38:54.608 --> 38:57.175
100 red scorpions, was it?

38:57.277 --> 38:59.778
You have nothing to fear
from us, Lady Olenna.

38:59.880 --> 39:02.014
You murder your own prince,

39:02.116 --> 39:03.849
but you expect me to trust you?

39:03.951 --> 39:06.918
We invited you to Dorne
because we needed your help.

39:07.021 --> 39:09.287
You came to Dorne because
you needed our help.

39:09.390 --> 39:11.890
What is your name again?

39:11.992 --> 39:13.358
Barbaro?

39:13.460 --> 39:15.060
Obara.

39:15.162 --> 39:18.296
Obara. You look like
an angry little boy.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.033
<i>Don't presume to tell me what I need.</i>

39:21.135 --> 39:24.469
Forgive my sister. What she
lacks in diplomacy, she makes...

39:24.571 --> 39:28.073
Do shut up, dear.
Anything from you?

39:28.175 --> 39:30.075
No? Good.

39:30.177 --> 39:32.577
Let the grown women speak.

39:32.680 --> 39:36.381
The Lannisters have declared
war on House Tyrell.

39:36.483 --> 39:39.451
They have declared war on Dorne.

39:39.553 --> 39:43.188
We must be allies now
if we wish to survive.

39:44.491 --> 39:47.459
Cersei stole the future from me.

39:47.561 --> 39:49.327
She killed my son.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.463
<i>She killed my grandson.</i>

39:51.565 --> 39:54.766
She killed my granddaughter.

39:54.868 --> 39:57.703
Survival is not what I'm after now.

39:57.805 --> 39:59.971
You're absolutely right.

40:00.074 --> 40:02.641
I chose the wrong words.

40:02.743 --> 40:05.243
It is not survival I offer.

40:05.345 --> 40:07.679
It is your heart's desire.

40:09.516 --> 40:12.718
And what is my heart's desire?

40:14.288 --> 40:16.521
Vengeance.

40:16.623 --> 40:17.723
Justice.

40:21.462 --> 40:23.328
Fire and Blood.

40:29.803 --> 40:32.604
Your ships are nearly ready.

40:32.706 --> 40:35.006
I saw them painting the sails.

40:38.445 --> 40:42.247
I'm curious to see how the
Dothraki do on the poison water.

40:42.349 --> 40:44.249
You're not coming with us.

40:46.620 --> 40:49.855
New strategy?

40:49.957 --> 40:53.158
You want the Second Sons to
attack from the west coast?

40:53.260 --> 40:55.861
If we take Casterly Rock,

40:55.963 --> 40:59.531
the Lannisters will have nowhere to
run when you hit King's Landing.

40:59.633 --> 41:01.566
You're not going to Westeros.

41:01.668 --> 41:04.603
You're staying here
with the Second Sons.

41:04.705 --> 41:07.339
There's finally peace in Meereen.

41:07.441 --> 41:10.776
You will keep the peace while the
people choose their own leaders.

41:12.079 --> 41:13.879
Fuck Meereen.

41:13.981 --> 41:15.881
Fuck the people.

41:15.983 --> 41:18.250
I'm here for you, not them.

41:18.352 --> 41:20.018
You promised me.

41:20.120 --> 41:23.054
"My sword is yours.
My life is yours."

41:23.157 --> 41:26.258
<i>This is what I command.</i>

41:26.360 --> 41:29.361
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,

41:29.463 --> 41:31.963
I'll need to make alliances.

41:32.065 --> 41:35.433
The best way to make
alliances is with marriage.

41:38.772 --> 41:40.605
Who are you marrying this time?

41:40.707 --> 41:44.075
I don't know.
Maybe no one.

41:44.178 --> 41:47.279
But you need to lure all the
noble houses to the table?

41:47.381 --> 41:49.347
Are you a queen or fish bait?

41:51.785 --> 41:54.753
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

41:54.855 --> 41:57.088
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

41:57.191 --> 42:00.091
So that's what you want?
To be my mistress?

42:00.194 --> 42:03.495
I'm not proud. I don't care
what perfumed aristocrat

42:03.597 --> 42:05.697
sits beside you in the throne room.

42:05.799 --> 42:08.834
I don't want a crown.
I want you.

42:15.809 --> 42:18.009
I love you.

42:18.111 --> 42:20.579
And I make you happy.

42:20.681 --> 42:22.547
You know I do.

42:24.785 --> 42:28.486
Bring me with you.
Let me fight for you.

42:36.096 --> 42:37.362
I can't.

42:47.107 --> 42:48.840
The dwarf told you to do this?

42:48.942 --> 42:50.609
<i>No one tells me to do anything.</i>

42:50.711 --> 42:53.879
Clever fellow.
Can't argue with his logic.

42:53.981 --> 42:55.714
I'm no use to you over there.

42:55.816 --> 42:57.082
Don't get angry.

42:57.184 --> 43:00.352
I'm not angry.
I'm full of self-pity.

43:00.454 --> 43:02.053
Who comes after you?

43:02.155 --> 43:05.323
Who can ever follow Daenerys
Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

43:05.425 --> 43:07.692
A great number of women, I imagine.

43:13.901 --> 43:15.734
Specific orders will be left for you

43:15.836 --> 43:18.770
regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

43:18.872 --> 43:20.672
Bay of Dragons?

43:20.774 --> 43:23.775
We can't call it Slaver's
Bay anymore, can we?

43:26.780 --> 43:30.081
You'll get that throne you
want so badly, I'm sure of it.

43:31.418 --> 43:33.618
I hope it brings you happiness.

43:38.692 --> 43:41.293
I pity the lords of Westeros.

43:41.395 --> 43:43.561
They have no idea
what's coming for them.

43:43.664 --> 43:47.599
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

44:06.286 --> 44:08.586
How did he take it?

44:08.689 --> 44:10.755
No tears.

44:12.826 --> 44:15.460
I know it was hard for you.

44:15.562 --> 44:17.595
You turned away a man
who truly loves you

44:17.698 --> 44:20.598
because he would have been a
liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

44:23.170 --> 44:26.871
That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

44:26.974 --> 44:29.140
if it's any consolation.

44:32.045 --> 44:33.845
It's not.

44:33.947 --> 44:36.247
No, I suppose not.

44:36.350 --> 44:37.882
I'm terrible at consoling.

44:37.985 --> 44:40.285
Yes, you really are.

44:43.457 --> 44:47.659
All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

44:49.162 --> 44:52.030
You have your armies,
you have your ships,

44:52.132 --> 44:54.132
you have your dragons.

44:54.234 --> 44:56.201
Everything you've ever wanted

44:56.303 --> 44:59.204
since you were old enough
to want anything,

44:59.306 --> 45:01.172
it's all yours for the taking.

45:02.943 --> 45:04.876
Are you afraid?

45:08.048 --> 45:09.914
Good.

45:10.017 --> 45:12.751
You're in the great game now.

45:12.853 --> 45:15.420
And the great game's terrifying.

45:15.522 --> 45:17.989
The only people who
aren't afraid of failure

45:18.091 --> 45:20.191
are madmen like your father.

45:22.295 --> 45:24.396
Do you know what frightens me?

45:25.866 --> 45:28.533
I said farewell
to a man who loves me.

45:30.404 --> 45:33.972
A man I thought I cared for.

45:34.074 --> 45:36.041
And I felt nothing.

45:37.644 --> 45:39.544
Just impatient to get on with it.

45:42.649 --> 45:45.717
He wasn't the first to love you

45:45.819 --> 45:47.886
and he won't be the last.

45:51.792 --> 45:56.694
Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

45:59.266 --> 46:01.733
For what it's worth,
I've been a cynic

46:01.835 --> 46:03.968
for as long as I can remember.

46:04.071 --> 46:06.871
Everyone's always asking me
to believe in things...

46:06.973 --> 46:10.708
family, gods, kings, myself.

46:10.811 --> 46:12.644
It was often tempting

46:12.746 --> 46:15.080
until I saw where belief got people.

46:16.450 --> 46:19.050
So I said no, thank you to belief.

46:19.152 --> 46:22.454
And yet here I am.

46:25.158 --> 46:27.425
I believe in you.

46:29.362 --> 46:31.763
It's embarrassing, really.

46:33.834 --> 46:35.633
I'd swear you my sword,

46:35.735 --> 46:38.770
but I don't actually own a sword.

46:38.872 --> 46:40.872
It's your counsel I need.

46:40.974 --> 46:43.408
It's yours.

46:43.510 --> 46:44.943
Now and always.

46:46.446 --> 46:48.279
Good.

46:49.583 --> 46:51.616
I, um...

46:51.718 --> 46:53.485
I had something made for you.

46:55.188 --> 46:57.722
I'm not sure if it's right.

47:07.033 --> 47:09.734
Tyrion Lannister,

47:09.836 --> 47:11.736
I name you Hand of the Queen.

47:45.972 --> 47:48.506
You're not one of mine, are you?

47:48.608 --> 47:50.108
No, my lord.

47:50.210 --> 47:51.876
Didn't think so.

47:51.978 --> 47:54.212
Too pretty.

47:58.485 --> 48:01.286
Where are my damn moron sons?

48:01.388 --> 48:05.123
Black Walder and Lothar
promised to be here by midday.

48:05.225 --> 48:07.058
They're here, my lord.

48:07.160 --> 48:10.461
Well, what are they doing,
trimming their cunt hairs?

48:10.564 --> 48:12.630
Tell them to come here now.

48:12.732 --> 48:14.999
But they're already here, my lord.

48:19.039 --> 48:22.040
Here, my lord.

48:40.327 --> 48:42.360
They weren't easy to carve.

48:44.030 --> 48:45.930
Especially Black Walder.

48:46.032 --> 48:48.600
What...

48:56.009 --> 48:57.675
My name is Arya Stark.

48:57.777 --> 48:59.277
I want you to know that.

48:59.379 --> 49:02.113
The last thing
you're ever going to see

49:02.215 --> 49:04.949
is a Stark smiling down
at you as you die.

49:59.739 --> 50:01.739
Forgive me, my lady...

50:03.176 --> 50:06.177
if you're at prayer.

50:06.279 --> 50:08.279
I'm done with all that.

50:10.483 --> 50:13.017
I came here every day
when I was a girl.

50:14.313 --> 50:17.555
I prayed to be somewhere else.

50:17.657 --> 50:19.757
Back then I only thought
about what I wanted,

50:19.859 --> 50:21.693
never about what I had.

50:25.465 --> 50:26.898
I was a stupid girl.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.933
You were a child.

50:32.238 --> 50:34.706
What do you want?

50:34.808 --> 50:37.175
I thought you knew what I wanted.

50:37.277 --> 50:38.876
I was wrong.

50:38.978 --> 50:41.646
No, you weren't.

50:44.749 --> 50:46.315
Every time I'm faced with a decision,

50:46.417 --> 50:48.651
I close my eyes and see
the same picture.

50:50.354 --> 50:53.756
Whenever I consider
an action, I ask myself

50:53.858 --> 50:57.993
will this action help to make
this picture a reality?

50:59.964 --> 51:02.732
Pull it out of my mind

51:02.834 --> 51:04.667
and into the world?

51:06.771 --> 51:09.739
And I only act if the answer is yes.

51:12.510 --> 51:17.079
A picture of me on the Iron Throne...

51:19.884 --> 51:21.784
and you by my side.

51:31.863 --> 51:33.763
It's a pretty picture.

51:39.303 --> 51:42.805
News of this battle will spread
quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.

51:42.907 --> 51:46.408
I've declared for House
Stark for all to hear.

51:46.511 --> 51:48.978
You've declared for other
houses before, Lord Baelish.

51:49.080 --> 51:51.781
It's never stopped you
from serving yourself.

51:51.883 --> 51:54.083
The past is gone for good.

51:54.185 --> 51:56.252
You can sit here
mourning its departure

51:56.354 --> 51:59.288
or you can prepare for the future.

51:59.390 --> 52:01.857
You, my love,

52:01.959 --> 52:04.593
are the future of House Stark.

52:04.695 --> 52:08.364
Who should the North rally behind?

52:08.466 --> 52:11.133
A trueborn daughter
of Ned and Catelyn Stark

52:11.235 --> 52:13.135
born here at Winterfell

52:13.237 --> 52:16.438
or a motherless bastard
born in the south?

52:42.700 --> 52:44.934
This is where I leave you.

52:45.036 --> 52:46.836
You're not coming with us?

52:48.306 --> 52:51.707
The Wall is not just ice and stone.

52:51.809 --> 52:54.977
Ancient spells were carved
into its foundations.

52:56.781 --> 52:58.848
Strong magic

52:58.950 --> 53:02.084
to protect men from what lies beyond.

53:02.186 --> 53:06.022
And while it stands,
the dead cannot pass.

53:06.124 --> 53:07.124
I cannot pass.

53:23.841 --> 53:25.775
Where will you go?

53:25.877 --> 53:27.410
The great war is coming

53:27.512 --> 53:30.312
<i>and I still fight for the living.</i>

53:32.383 --> 53:34.483
I'll do what I can...

53:35.853 --> 53:38.054
as long as I can.

53:41.959 --> 53:44.060
Thank you, Uncle Benjen.

53:44.162 --> 53:46.495
I wish you both good fortune.

54:25.770 --> 54:28.304
Are you sure you're ready for this?

54:28.406 --> 54:31.507
I'm the Three-Eyed
Raven now.

54:31.609 --> 54:33.843
I have to be ready for this.

55:07.445 --> 55:10.079
<i>Ned?</i>

55:10.104 --> 55:12.604
Lyanna.

55:12.784 --> 55:14.884
Is that you?

55:18.656 --> 55:20.656
Is that really you?

55:25.596 --> 55:27.496
You're not a dream?

55:28.633 --> 55:30.733
No, I'm not a dream.

55:32.403 --> 55:34.270
I'm here.

55:35.940 --> 55:37.706
Right here.

55:37.809 --> 55:40.142
I've missed you, big brother.

55:43.481 --> 55:45.481
I've missed you, too.

55:49.821 --> 55:51.720
I want to be brave.

55:51.823 --> 55:54.256
Shh.

55:54.358 --> 55:56.859
You are.

55:56.961 --> 55:59.695
I'm not.

56:01.899 --> 56:04.667
I don't want to die.

56:04.769 --> 56:07.002
You're not going to die.

56:10.808 --> 56:12.641
Get her some water.

56:12.743 --> 56:15.044
- No, no water.
- Is there a maester?

56:15.146 --> 56:17.479
Listen to me, Ned.

56:23.888 --> 56:26.622
If Robert finds out, he'll...

56:26.724 --> 56:28.591
you know he will.

56:28.693 --> 56:30.559
You have to protect him.

56:33.631 --> 56:35.531
Promise me, Ned.

56:37.935 --> 56:39.802
Promise me.

56:51.949 --> 56:53.916
Promise me, Ned.

56:58.389 --> 57:00.189
Promise me.

57:30.755 --> 57:33.656
You can't expect Knights of the Vale

57:33.758 --> 57:36.392
to side with wildling invaders.

57:36.494 --> 57:40.429
We didn't invade.
We were invited.

57:40.531 --> 57:42.231
Not by me.

57:42.333 --> 57:44.133
The free folk, the northerners,

57:44.235 --> 57:46.602
and the Knights of the Vale
fought bravely,

57:46.704 --> 57:49.004
fought together, and we won.

57:49.106 --> 57:53.842
My father used to say we find our
true friends on the battlefield.

57:53.945 --> 57:56.545
The Boltons are defeated.

57:56.647 --> 57:58.580
The war is over.

57:58.683 --> 58:00.582
Winter has come.

58:00.685 --> 58:04.186
If the maesters are right, it'll be
the coldest one in a thousand years.

58:04.288 --> 58:07.723
We should ride home
and wait out the coming storms.

58:07.825 --> 58:09.925
The war is not over.

58:10.027 --> 58:12.061
And I promise you, friend,

58:12.163 --> 58:15.097
the true enemy
won't wait out the storm.

58:15.199 --> 58:16.699
He brings the storm.

58:36.687 --> 58:40.756
Your son was butchered at the
Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,

58:40.858 --> 58:42.691
but you refused the call.

58:46.030 --> 58:49.031
You swore allegiance
to House Stark, Lord Glover,

58:49.133 --> 58:51.734
but in their hour of greatest need,

58:51.836 --> 58:53.836
you refused the call.

58:55.940 --> 58:57.973
<i>And you, Lord Cerwyn,</i>

58:58.075 --> 59:01.944
your father was skinned
alive by Ramsay Bolton.

59:02.046 --> 59:04.513
Still you refused the call.

59:07.618 --> 59:11.487
<i>But House Mormont remembers.</i>

59:11.589 --> 59:14.289
The North remembers.

59:14.392 --> 59:18.961
We know no king but the King in
the North whose name is Stark.

59:20.731 --> 59:22.498
<i>I don't care if he's a bastard.</i>

59:22.600 --> 59:25.200
<i>Ned Stark's blood
runs through his veins.</i>

59:25.302 --> 59:29.772
He's my king from this
day until his last day.

59:46.457 --> 59:49.024
Lady Mormont speaks harshly

59:49.126 --> 59:50.426
and truly.

59:53.831 --> 59:58.934
My son died for Robb Stark,
the Young Wolf.

59:59.036 --> 01:00:02.104
I didn't think we'd find
another king in my lifetime.

01:00:02.206 --> 01:00:04.640
I didn't commit my men to your cause

01:00:04.742 --> 01:00:07.376
'cause I didn't want more
Manderlys dying for nothing.

01:00:09.647 --> 01:00:11.113
But I was wrong.

01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:19.054
Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.

01:00:19.156 --> 01:00:21.557
<i> He is the White Wolf.</i>

01:00:21.659 --> 01:00:24.593
The King in the North.

01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:34.536
I did not fight
beside you on the field

01:00:34.638 --> 01:00:38.073
and I will regret that
until my dying day.

01:00:38.175 --> 01:00:42.811
<i>A man can only admit
when he was wrong</i>

01:00:42.913 --> 01:00:44.480
and ask forgiveness.

01:00:47.485 --> 01:00:49.785
There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

01:00:52.389 --> 01:00:54.890
There will be more fights to come.

01:00:54.992 --> 01:00:58.527
House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

01:00:58.629 --> 01:01:00.929
as we have for a thousand years.

01:01:02.766 --> 01:01:05.000
And I will stand behind Jon Snow...

01:01:07.438 --> 01:01:09.505
The King in the North!

01:01:11.408 --> 01:01:14.309
The King in the North!

01:01:14.411 --> 01:01:17.713
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

01:01:17.815 --> 01:01:21.150
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

01:01:21.252 --> 01:01:24.453
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

01:01:24.555 --> 01:01:28.056
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

01:01:28.159 --> 01:01:31.827
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

01:01:31.929 --> 01:01:35.797
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.767
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

01:01:38.869 --> 01:01:42.037
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

01:01:42.139 --> 01:01:45.340
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

01:01:45.442 --> 01:01:48.744
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

01:01:48.846 --> 01:01:51.680
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

01:01:57.384 --> 01:01:59.888
<i>Company halt!</i>

01:02:02.893 --> 01:02:04.359
<i>Halt!</i>

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:08.363
<i>Halt!</i>

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:21.043
Come on.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.801
I now proclaim Cersei
of the House Lannister

01:03:19.903 --> 01:03:22.537
First of Her Name,

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.008
<i>Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,</i>

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:29.311
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

01:04:15.159 --> 01:04:17.225
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

01:04:17.328 --> 01:04:19.494
<i>Long may she reign.</i>
