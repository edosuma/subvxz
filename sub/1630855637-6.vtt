WEBVTT

00:07.466 --> 00:10.553
I kept my end.
Bastard.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.138
[Arthur] Return this man
to captivity.

00:12.221 --> 00:15.808
This humiliation
of my nephew serves no purpose.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.102
I will spare his life.
Nothing more.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.397
[Arthur] The Saxons are
massing in earnest.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.149
-They're coming for us.
-If you want to build

00:23.232 --> 00:25.735
trust between us,
releasing my nephew Gundleus

00:25.818 --> 00:27.778
would be a first step
on our path.

00:28.571 --> 00:29.697
[Arthur] He's a Saxon spy.

00:29.780 --> 00:33.576
[screaming, groaning]

00:33.659 --> 00:35.494
-What did he say?
-"Aelle, Aelle.

00:35.578 --> 00:37.204
He will kill you all."

00:37.288 --> 00:38.414
[Morgan] Where's Nimue?

00:38.497 --> 00:39.749
[Merlin] Following her own path.

00:39.832 --> 00:41.250
[Nimue] I cannot
bear his child.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.668
[Merlin] You could've
killed yourself.

00:42.752 --> 00:44.253
[Bedwin] Prince Tristan.
Welcome.

00:44.336 --> 00:46.088
[Tristan] There will
be blood between my kingdom

00:46.172 --> 00:48.090
and yours,
unless I receive justice.

00:48.174 --> 00:50.593
But did you see the man
who killed your family?

00:50.676 --> 00:52.261
He wore a string
of warrior rings.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.846
You are a coward!

00:53.929 --> 00:55.431
This ain't your quarrel, Arthur.

00:55.514 --> 00:56.682
[Arthur] Sacred sword

00:56.765 --> 00:58.392
passed down the generations.

00:58.476 --> 01:01.020
She said it would call out
to its rightful owner,

01:01.103 --> 01:03.646
-like a beacon.
-[battle-cry]

01:06.525 --> 01:08.985
[both grunting]

01:27.338 --> 01:30.382
[thunder rumbling]

01:30.466 --> 01:33.259
[elegiac music]

02:05.167 --> 02:06.544
[exhales]

02:07.419 --> 02:08.838
[exhales]

02:19.515 --> 02:21.725
[thunder rumbling]

02:27.857 --> 02:30.609
Before the eyes
of Caer Cadarn,

02:30.692 --> 02:33.320
and before the Gods,

02:33.404 --> 02:35.114
I anoint you

02:35.197 --> 02:38.284
Dumnonia's ruler
and Britain's defender!

02:38.367 --> 02:43.747
[cheers]

03:15.070 --> 03:16.614
Show me.

03:19.241 --> 03:22.161
Just an old sword I found
at my mother's forge.

03:22.244 --> 03:23.746
Mm.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.957
Typical of Igraine
to hide it in plain sight.

03:28.459 --> 03:30.711
This has many names.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.590
Caledfwlch,

03:34.673 --> 03:37.176
Cadalchog,

03:37.259 --> 03:39.094
Excalibur.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.013
What's known for sure is
that it was forged

03:41.096 --> 03:43.807
in the Otherworld
by Gobannus...

03:44.767 --> 03:46.018
the God of smithcraft.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.937
I know who Gobannus is.

03:48.020 --> 03:51.774
But really, there is
no mystery to this blade.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.901
I found it in Ireland.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.362
Won it off a druid
in a dream contest.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.405
You gave this sword
to my mother?

04:00.783 --> 04:02.284
Why didn't she tell me?

04:02.368 --> 04:04.119
She feared for you.

04:04.203 --> 04:07.873
She didn't put it past Uther
to accuse you of treason.

04:07.957 --> 04:11.543
We agreed, together,
it was for the best.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.380
[sighing] Sometimes I wish
you hadn't meddled

04:14.463 --> 04:15.714
in my childhood, Merlin.

04:15.798 --> 04:17.633
I didn't meddle,
I helped raise you

04:17.716 --> 04:19.051
with her blessing.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.929
You encouraged her
to keep secrets from me.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.765
Anyhow,
it's as it should be.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.017
You've found Excalibur
for yourself.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.062
When the sword's wearer
is in trouble,

04:30.145 --> 04:32.481
Gobannus will leave
the Otherworld

04:32.564 --> 04:34.316
and come to his help.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.819
You fought with
such strength and certainty

04:36.902 --> 04:38.737
against Owain today
because you held

04:38.821 --> 04:40.614
this sword in your hand.

04:40.698 --> 04:43.242
This sword...

04:43.325 --> 04:45.786
[sighing]

04:45.869 --> 04:47.371
...did not kill Owain.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.833
I killed Owain.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.793
I have to live with that.

04:54.003 --> 04:56.588
Why won't you accept
you are not alone?

04:56.672 --> 04:58.257
If you are
to save Britain,

04:58.340 --> 05:00.676
and I believe
you're the only person who can,

05:00.759 --> 05:02.845
you need to look
around you.

05:02.928 --> 05:06.181
You have friends,
seen and unseen.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.185
I am grateful for all
you've done for me, Merlin,

05:10.269 --> 05:12.187
and for the faith
that you have in me.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.774
I will try to bring peace
to this isle

05:15.858 --> 05:17.401
and happiness to its people.

05:20.612 --> 05:23.240
But I will do it my way.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.162
[dramatic music]

05:44.803 --> 05:46.847
[mewing]

05:49.391 --> 05:52.186
Why can't you pick it up
and take it to the child?

05:53.312 --> 05:55.439
Because it's not tame yet.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.067
[mewing]

05:58.150 --> 05:59.860
[Derfel clicks tongue]

05:59.943 --> 06:01.445
[chuckle]

06:02.780 --> 06:04.364
That's new.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.201
It wouldn't let me
do that yesterday.

06:08.619 --> 06:11.205
As if we don't have
enough things to worry about.

06:12.081 --> 06:14.041
Sarlinna has no family.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.627
-Come here. Come here.
-[mewing]

06:17.586 --> 06:19.505
The least I can do is
give her a kitten.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.674
Owain might have made mistakes,
but he was a good man.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.301
And he was good to us.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.346
You had a bright future.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.056
Now...

06:30.933 --> 06:32.851
I feel better...

06:32.935 --> 06:34.895
lighter... now,

06:34.978 --> 06:36.522
than when I was Owain's man.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.232
We have to eat.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.400
Have you asked Arthur
if he can help us?

06:41.193 --> 06:43.112
I could never ask him.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.075
You broke your oath
to Lord Owain.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.452
You told Arthur
about the mine.

06:50.536 --> 06:53.205
-No, I did not.
-Don't you lie to me.

06:53.288 --> 06:54.915
I didn't!

06:54.998 --> 06:56.333
Aah!

06:58.210 --> 07:01.046
Your luck has
run out now, boy!

07:01.130 --> 07:03.382
-It wasn't me!
-[overlapping shouting]

07:03.465 --> 07:05.843
Raince Ap Annan!

07:20.566 --> 07:21.984
Yes...

07:22.067 --> 07:24.319
your name is
on that Curse Tablet.

07:24.403 --> 07:26.405
All of your names
are on it.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.741
Your deaths are
in my hand.

07:29.825 --> 07:32.619
Your lives are mine.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.455
And your souls.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.333
Get down.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.546
Get down on your belly.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.968
On your belly!

07:49.845 --> 07:51.513
You must swear an oath...

07:51.597 --> 07:53.932
never to harm Derfel.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.350
And if you don't,

07:55.433 --> 07:57.644
then Igraine
will crush your bones

07:57.728 --> 07:59.605
and take you with her

07:59.688 --> 08:01.481
to the dark Otherworld,

08:01.565 --> 08:04.067
where you will stay
forevermore.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.864
[grunting]

08:08.947 --> 08:12.159
You will never find
new bodies on this green earth.

08:12.241 --> 08:16.246
I, I, I, I swear,
I swear!

08:17.039 --> 08:18.289
I need to hear it
from all of you.

08:18.373 --> 08:21.084
[men] I swear.
I swear. I swear.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.047
Go! Run!

08:25.130 --> 08:27.049
While you still have
a head on your body.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.176
If you dare look back...

08:33.639 --> 08:35.307
How did you know
they'd come for us?

08:35.390 --> 08:38.143
I've been watching them
since Owain's death.

08:38.227 --> 08:39.978
It was obvious
they'd try something.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.688
You might have saved Derfel,

08:41.772 --> 08:44.524
but there is nothing
to stop them coming for me.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.907
[Arthur] My father always met
with the Kings of Britain

08:51.990 --> 08:53.575
in the Great Hall.

08:53.659 --> 08:56.620
But it was from this room
that he ran the country.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.958
Choose any place at the table;
we're all equal here.

09:09.466 --> 09:13.553
You say we're all equal,
but you're not a king.

09:13.637 --> 09:17.015
As your name,
Arthur Ap Neb, tells us,

09:17.099 --> 09:20.102
you are of no one.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.188
It's true.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.274
That honor is my brother's.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.109
[Gorfydd]
Who's still a baby.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.611
Merlin has declared you
Dumnonia's ruler.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.697
-The Gods have declared it.
-Ah, yes, of course,

09:31.780 --> 09:33.282
you speak for the Gods.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.451
When Uther was alive,

09:36.535 --> 09:40.289
he named three men
to be protectors of his son.

09:41.206 --> 09:44.418
My nephew,
King Gundleus,

09:44.501 --> 09:47.629
Owain, and Bishop Bedwin.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.799
You've imprisoned Gundleus,

09:50.882 --> 09:52.634
you've killed Ow--

09:52.718 --> 09:53.969
oh...

09:54.803 --> 09:58.348
if I was you, Bishop,
I'd be very careful.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.728
I have the greatest faith
in Arthur, My Lord.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.439
It's an honor,
a privilege, to serve him.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.067
[Tristan] I won't miss Owain.

10:09.151 --> 10:11.236
He slaughtered my people
at the tin mine.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.572
And Gundleus murdered
Queen Norwenna.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.283
Yes, yes, all true,
but it doesn't change

10:16.366 --> 10:18.118
my question.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.121
What are your intentions?

10:26.835 --> 10:28.628
While my brother grows...

10:29.588 --> 10:31.423
someone must
take responsibility

10:31.506 --> 10:33.550
for governing Dumnonia.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.720
I will be that person.

10:38.388 --> 10:41.016
But I swear to you all now,

10:41.099 --> 10:45.062
I will use the power given
to me for one end only...

10:46.104 --> 10:48.190
to see Mordred
take his kingdom

10:48.273 --> 10:50.067
when he comes of age.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.362
We'll hold you to that.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.614
I expect nothing less.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.533
Although there may
not be a kingdom

10:58.617 --> 11:00.452
for my brother to inherit.

11:00.535 --> 11:03.038
I've brought us together
to discuss the Saxons.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.540
They've already taken
Calleva and Durobrivis.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.959
They're pushing
through the eastern boundaries,

11:08.043 --> 11:09.711
not just of Dumnonia,

11:09.795 --> 11:12.089
but of Gwent, and Elmet.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.218
[distant voices]

11:22.140 --> 11:23.683
[Derfel] Lunete.

11:30.899 --> 11:34.236
Father always wished
for us to be together.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.363
When he was gone...

11:36.446 --> 11:38.865
it felt right
to be with you.

11:39.825 --> 11:43.412
-But now...
-Don't worry about Nimue.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.414
Okay? And I will make sure

11:45.497 --> 11:47.332
that Raince and his men
don't hurt you.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.501
I want a nice life.

11:49.584 --> 11:54.005
A pretty place to live
and children.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.007
Is that so bad?

11:56.091 --> 11:57.509
No.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.137
It's what most people want.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.557
My path is to be a warrior.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.393
To be Arthur's warrior.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.271
Arthur doesn't allow women
to travel with his men.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.022
But they always come home

12:11.106 --> 12:12.607
to their wives and children,

12:12.691 --> 12:14.901
and they have
stories to tell.

12:15.777 --> 12:18.321
I'd prefer a husband
by my side.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.452
I'm sorry, Derfel...

12:23.535 --> 12:25.745
but Father was wrong
about us.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.166
We're not meant to be together.

12:40.135 --> 12:43.138
[Tewdric] I've had to double
my men on the borders.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.056
There are
more Saxon encampments

12:45.140 --> 12:46.725
than ever before.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.435
[Arthur]
We caught a Saxon spy

12:48.518 --> 12:52.731
who spoke
of a new leader: Aelle.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.233
He's gathering information
and using that information

12:55.317 --> 12:57.319
to advance in the east.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.196
Kernow is not at risk.

13:01.907 --> 13:05.076
[Arthur] If Dumnonia fell,
the Saxons would be in Kernow

13:05.160 --> 13:06.495
in three days.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.080
And of course,
it is the same with Isca.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.833
So, what do you suggest?

13:11.917 --> 13:13.752
An alliance,

13:13.835 --> 13:15.754
between Dumnonia,

13:15.837 --> 13:17.506
Powys,

13:17.589 --> 13:19.549
Gwent, and Kernow.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.968
Blood of each other's blood.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.888
An attack on any one of us
is an attack on us all.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.518
I'll put my name to it.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.686
[Tristan] So will I.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.314
You've shown yourself
a friend to Kernow.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.695
-[Arthur] King Gorfydd.
-Mm?

13:40.779 --> 13:44.115
Oh, the Saxons raid us,
but we keep them in their place.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.117
Ratae is your only town

13:46.201 --> 13:48.870
-really holding them back.
-Ratae won't fall.

13:48.954 --> 13:51.790
That's what King Ban of Gaul
said of Ynys Trebes.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.834
-Ynys Trebes still holds.
-[Arthur] Not for long.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.213
I've been there.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.881
The Franks surround it,

13:59.965 --> 14:01.550
deprive it
of food and water.

14:01.633 --> 14:05.136
It shrivels like
a dried apple in their hands.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.056
The Gauls suffer,
they die.

14:08.139 --> 14:11.351
The Franks grow stronger,
they surge across the sea.

14:11.434 --> 14:15.188
Wave upon wave of them come.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.649
Just like the Saxons.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.819
Powys is allied with Siluria.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.320
But...

14:22.404 --> 14:25.699
my nephew, Gundleus,
is your prisoner.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.702
If Gundleus were to join
our alliance,

14:28.785 --> 14:30.245
we would consider a pardon.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.372
We can't submit to Dumnonia.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.833
-There would be no submission.
-That's what your father said,

14:34.916 --> 14:38.420
yet he ruled
by power and fear.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.506
We would make
decisions together.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.592
A Council of Kings,

14:43.675 --> 14:46.386
like we are now,
around this table.

14:48.680 --> 14:52.851
Dumnonia and Powys have been
at odds for too long.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.478
I'll prove my goodwill to you.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.481
You have a daughter.

15:00.525 --> 15:03.486
The "Star of Powys,"
people call her.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.909
She is a shining star,
my Ceinwyn.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.414
What of her?

15:19.794 --> 15:21.838
Let us be joined
in marriage.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.592
[dramatic music]

15:34.016 --> 15:36.019
[soft chatter]

15:40.148 --> 15:41.900
Saddle the horses.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.819
Pack food bags.
And some wine.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.759
You're not even ready.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.886
We're missing
the best of the day.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.348
What's happened?

16:13.431 --> 16:14.974
A messenger came...

16:16.016 --> 16:17.143
from my father.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.146
Leave us.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.946
I'm to be married.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.489
What?

16:29.572 --> 16:31.199
I know.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.992
It's come out of nowhere.

16:34.119 --> 16:35.995
It's not to Gundleus,
is it?

16:37.706 --> 16:40.999
[sighing]
Then who?

16:42.419 --> 16:44.670
Arthur Ap Neb.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.049
When Father went south,

16:48.132 --> 16:50.343
did he tell you
anything about this?

16:50.427 --> 16:53.304
He's always promised
I'd get to choose my husband.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.849
And I've always warned you
not to believe him.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.392
Arthur's not even
a Tribe King, he's a...

16:58.476 --> 17:01.020
Bastard.
[laughs]

17:02.397 --> 17:03.898
You know
that doesn't matter.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.484
It's what the man is,
who he is.

17:06.568 --> 17:08.069
But we don't know him.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.654
We've never met him.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.865
I have no idea
what he even looks like.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.910
Why would Father
promise me to him?

17:15.994 --> 17:18.538
He has no title,
no lands.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.373
He must have something.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.084
Did the messenger say
anything else?

17:23.168 --> 17:25.044
Something about
an alliance

17:25.128 --> 17:27.172
between Powys
and Dumnonia.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.507
Your father would never ally
with Dumnonia.

17:29.591 --> 17:32.093
It doesn't make sense.
None of it does.

17:32.177 --> 17:34.220
Perhaps Arthur
persuaded him.

17:34.304 --> 17:35.764
He saw off Gundleus,

17:35.847 --> 17:38.099
enticed your father
to Caer Cadarn.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.769
I don't wanna marry.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.896
It'll change everything.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.023
This could be a good union.

17:45.106 --> 17:46.858
You have more status
than Arthur.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.903
He needs you,
and it's important to be needed.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.197
You can state your terms
and set your rules.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.908
I can't even begin
to do any of that.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.577
You're stronger than you think.

18:12.884 --> 18:15.720
[Gorfydd]
There's a tradition in Powys.

18:15.804 --> 18:18.473
A man wears
a lock of his lover's hair

18:18.556 --> 18:20.850
woven around his neck.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.021
This was Ceinwyn's mother's.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.566
She passed on
to the Otherworld

18:28.650 --> 18:30.193
when Ceinwyn was a child.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.866
You must both miss her.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.788
My daughter is
everything to me now.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.124
I won't let her down.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.966
[Lanval] Marriage
to an unknown princess.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.926
Why is he doing this?

18:55.009 --> 18:56.678
He believes
it's right for Britain.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.805
But is it right for him?

18:58.888 --> 19:00.765
He has to marry someday.

19:00.849 --> 19:03.434
Might as well be
Princess Ceinwyn as anyone else.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.853
He said that to you?

19:04.936 --> 19:07.730
-That's what he believes.
-Mm.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.860
I just hope he's thought it
through, that's all.

19:16.865 --> 19:20.034
[soft wind blowing]

19:41.472 --> 19:43.683
[ominous music]

19:49.480 --> 19:52.734
[panting]

19:55.320 --> 19:56.946
[cawing]

20:03.077 --> 20:05.121
[Merlin]
Horn of Bran.

20:36.277 --> 20:39.280
[birds tweeting]

20:56.631 --> 20:58.299
You're searching
for the treasures

20:58.383 --> 21:01.469
because you think
you need to appease the Gods.

21:01.552 --> 21:04.305
It's about time
I journeyed north anyway.

21:04.389 --> 21:07.392
Haven't been
to the wilderness in years.

21:07.475 --> 21:10.561
Stingy Bran,
they used to call him.

21:10.645 --> 21:13.064
Isn't the Horn of Bran the most
difficult treasure to find?

21:13.147 --> 21:16.985
But if I do,
the rest will come.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.569
By themselves,
they're nothing,

21:18.653 --> 21:20.947
but place this
with the other 12 treasures,

21:21.030 --> 21:24.200
and they'll give us back
the power to reclaim Britain.

21:25.368 --> 21:28.663
We'll have the Gods
hopping like frogs.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.498
[laughing]

21:30.581 --> 21:33.167
-[sighing]
-And we'll need their power.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.254
Excalibur's in Arthur's hand.

21:36.337 --> 21:37.797
Excalibur?

21:37.880 --> 21:40.383
He killed Owain
with that sacred blade.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.596
So the Gods are with him.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.181
They always have been.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.642
I must try
to forgive him, then.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.352
You must.

21:51.436 --> 21:54.772
Although he still refuses
to accept his destiny.

21:54.856 --> 21:57.275
He could have become
King of Britain.

21:57.358 --> 22:01.237
Is it true that
he pardoned Gundleus?

22:04.198 --> 22:06.117
If I'm not back by winter,

22:06.200 --> 22:08.202
celebrate the solstice.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.373
It was a blessed day

22:12.457 --> 22:14.834
when the Gods
brought you to me.

22:31.559 --> 22:33.311
Here.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.521
-Thank you.
-[horse neighing]

22:54.957 --> 22:56.417
How are you, Nimue?

22:56.501 --> 22:58.544
If you're looking for Merlin,
he's already gone.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.423
-Where?
-Beyond Strathclota,

23:02.507 --> 23:04.675
to the wilderness
in the north.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.094
He didn't tell me.

23:06.177 --> 23:08.679
He is searching
for the Horn of Bran.

23:08.763 --> 23:10.389
I'd like to have
wished him luck.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.186
What's happening here?

23:15.269 --> 23:17.522
We're repairing the vats.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.607
Who's in charge?

23:19.690 --> 23:21.442
Me.

23:23.194 --> 23:24.904
Good for you.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.408
Is Derfel here?

23:30.993 --> 23:32.328
Mm.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.417
He's been laying low,

23:38.501 --> 23:41.629
since most of Caer Cadarn
think he's an oath breaker.

23:41.712 --> 23:45.007
I've given Owain's men to Kernow
as part of the Sarhaed.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.094
But you're making peace
with old enemies.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.096
King Gorfydd is
Gundleus's uncle.

23:50.179 --> 23:51.597
I need Gorfydd.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.766
He recognizes
we have to unite the isle,

23:53.850 --> 23:56.936
so I had to pardon
Gundleus, Nimue.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.233
I will kill him one day.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.652
I've never doubted it.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.279
But not yet.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.032
Derfel!

24:13.494 --> 24:15.163
[Derfel] Lord.

24:15.246 --> 24:17.915
You told me once
you wanted to serve me.

24:17.999 --> 24:20.501
-Is that still true?
-Yes.

24:20.585 --> 24:23.588
And you're sure you know
what that means?

24:23.671 --> 24:26.424
The sacrifices
you'll have to make?

24:26.507 --> 24:27.884
I do.

24:29.594 --> 24:32.263
Then that settles it.
You're to be my man.

24:32.346 --> 24:34.223
You won't regret it.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.310
I will lay down my life for you.

24:38.603 --> 24:42.148
For now, you just have
to travel to Powys with me.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.584
Travel safe, Derfel.

25:21.062 --> 25:23.231
[spirited music]

25:25.816 --> 25:28.319
[sighing]
Derfel.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.029
-You feel strong?
-Yeah.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.822
Sag, what do you think?

25:31.906 --> 25:33.449
Not bad, huh?

25:39.747 --> 25:42.458
-Not bad.
-[laughing]

25:48.172 --> 25:51.592
[laughing]

25:51.676 --> 25:54.262
[all laughing]

25:56.847 --> 25:59.016
I am the death pit boy.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.352
[laughter]

26:01.435 --> 26:02.603
You move, you die.

26:05.106 --> 26:07.149
[laughter]

26:15.616 --> 26:17.660
[Lunete] You look different.

26:20.329 --> 26:23.416
I thought you'd gone
to your sister.

26:24.709 --> 26:26.794
I leave tomorrow...

26:26.877 --> 26:28.421
like you.

26:34.468 --> 26:38.347
Father's. I found it
at our old hut at Avalon.

26:43.811 --> 26:45.646
Are you sure?

26:45.730 --> 26:48.107
He would have
wanted you to have it.

27:08.044 --> 27:11.005
I'll call it Hywelbane.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.381
After him.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.764
It's cold
where we're going.

27:19.847 --> 27:22.058
You'll need these.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.479
Why is Sansum
going with you?

27:26.562 --> 27:29.148
So he can't cause
any trouble for you.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.025
He can practice
his sermons

27:31.108 --> 27:32.860
on any Christians
he finds in Powys.

27:32.943 --> 27:35.071
[laughing]

27:37.365 --> 27:39.241
Marry my brother.

27:40.284 --> 27:42.703
Bring him
and his bride back to us.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.038
I will.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.165
Make sure
you come back safe too.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.210
[Arthur] Bishop!

27:50.920 --> 27:52.713
My Lord.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.217
Good luck.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.635
I wish you were coming.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.845
Oh, how hard can
marriage be?

28:00.805 --> 28:02.848
While you're sighing
over lovers' rings,

28:02.932 --> 28:06.060
Sagramor and I will be
defending the Edling King.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.312
Lord Sag.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.398
I still can't get used
to the title.

28:10.481 --> 28:13.317
You're Dumnonia's
new champion.

28:13.401 --> 28:14.819
Comes with the role.

28:14.902 --> 28:17.321
[Arthur] As is
enlisting new warriors.

28:17.405 --> 28:19.490
I hope to return
to Dumnonia's army

28:19.573 --> 28:23.119
-tripled in size, Lord Sag.
-[horse neighing]

28:31.085 --> 28:32.420
I'm happy you've joined us.

28:32.503 --> 28:34.839
For my freedom,
it was worth it.

28:34.922 --> 28:37.383
And I'm glad to see
you're by your lord's side.

28:39.301 --> 28:42.096
Our alliance requires trust.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.889
On both sides.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.393
What's he doing here?

28:48.436 --> 28:50.438
He's one of my men.

28:50.521 --> 28:53.357
He was lucky not to die
under my hand at Avalon.

28:53.441 --> 28:56.735
[Arthur] Sheathe your sword,
King Gundleus.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.780
My nephew's temper
is ragged,

28:59.864 --> 29:01.782
he's been locked up too long.
[chuckling]

29:01.866 --> 29:06.704
But he understands
that we travel in peace.

29:06.787 --> 29:10.458
As does my man.
Don't you, Derfel?

29:10.541 --> 29:12.418
Yes, My Lord.

29:17.715 --> 29:19.049
[laughing]

29:19.133 --> 29:20.801
Well, I wouldn't
blunt my sword

29:20.885 --> 29:22.928
on this Saxon cur anyway.

29:25.389 --> 29:28.267
[Arthur] We carry
no shields or spears.

29:30.895 --> 29:33.314
We travel to Powys
as friends.

29:33.397 --> 29:36.275
[neighing]

29:45.826 --> 29:48.787
[majestic music]

30:22.613 --> 30:25.157
The mountains of Tryfann.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.576
We're entering Powys.

31:03.821 --> 31:07.074
[birds tweeting]

31:07.157 --> 31:08.909
We'll rest here tonight,

31:08.993 --> 31:12.454
then tomorrow make the climb
for Caer Dolforwyn.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.462
[nickering]

31:29.346 --> 31:32.766
To... To ward off the cold.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.396
Can I?

31:37.479 --> 31:39.064
Mm.

31:44.862 --> 31:47.072
I've only ever
been to Powys once.

31:48.532 --> 31:52.369
Merlin wanted hawkweed;
sent Owain and me.

31:52.453 --> 31:54.079
[chuckling]

31:57.625 --> 31:59.585
You miss him.

32:02.963 --> 32:06.425
I miss the boy that he was,
not the man that he became.

32:08.302 --> 32:10.512
He'd cheer us up,
it's true.

32:13.515 --> 32:15.643
He'd tell me
that I was a fool...

32:16.727 --> 32:20.105
sleeping on open ground
with our enemies.

32:20.189 --> 32:23.067
I'm sure you've
weighed up the risks.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.819
I've always found Gorfydd's bark
worse than his bite.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.488
Mm.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.073
But your father
never paid him

32:29.156 --> 32:31.283
the respect
he felt was his due.

32:31.367 --> 32:33.118
Dumnonia suffered for it.

32:34.078 --> 32:37.665
Marriage to Princess Ceinwyn
will change all that.

32:42.503 --> 32:44.838
You ever loved a woman, Arthur?

32:50.594 --> 32:54.640
I've been fighting
King Ban's wars, so...

32:56.225 --> 32:57.893
I haven't met a great many.

32:59.186 --> 33:00.729
How about you?

33:04.358 --> 33:06.151
There's someone...

33:09.113 --> 33:11.615
I could imagine
as a life companion.

33:11.699 --> 33:13.742
Do I know her?

33:14.702 --> 33:16.745
You were brought up
beside her.

33:20.207 --> 33:21.667
My sister?

33:21.750 --> 33:24.044
Mm.
[soft chuckle]

33:24.128 --> 33:25.921
She'd never have me.

33:29.383 --> 33:30.926
Have you asked her?

33:34.471 --> 33:36.056
No...

33:36.140 --> 33:38.517
there's never been
a good time.

33:41.311 --> 33:42.688
Well...

33:43.981 --> 33:45.941
but now
you're to be married.

33:47.776 --> 33:50.320
A young queen
at Caer Cadarn.

33:50.404 --> 33:52.197
She won't be a queen.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.367
I'm the protector of
the young king, nothing more.

33:55.451 --> 33:56.869
I know, but...

33:56.952 --> 34:00.038
what... what I mean is...

34:01.749 --> 34:03.876
...there'll be women
at Caer Cadarn.

34:06.253 --> 34:07.921
Everything will change.

34:09.465 --> 34:12.050
[soft chatter]

34:13.093 --> 34:14.595
[grunts]

34:21.602 --> 34:23.479
Rest well, my friend.

34:52.716 --> 34:55.928
[soft music]

35:27.543 --> 35:29.878
[horse neighing]

36:12.629 --> 36:14.840
[nickering]

36:18.886 --> 36:21.054
[nickering]

36:25.225 --> 36:28.687
-[owl screeching]
-[panicked neighing]

36:33.233 --> 36:33.984
Keep away.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.652
You're scaring him more.

36:35.736 --> 36:36.862
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

36:36.945 --> 36:38.488
Shh, shh, shh there.

36:38.572 --> 36:41.033
Shh-shh-shh-shh, shh, shh.

36:42.159 --> 36:44.077
Are you all right, my lady?

36:45.913 --> 36:48.206
The horse didn't scare you?

36:48.290 --> 36:50.334
The owl spooked
poor Felten,

36:50.417 --> 36:51.919
that's all.

36:54.254 --> 36:57.215
And you didn't help,
appearing out of nowhere.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.802
I'm very sorry.

37:05.682 --> 37:07.351
What are you doing out here?

37:07.434 --> 37:10.354
I could ask you
the same question.

37:10.437 --> 37:12.606
Some fool left a bucket
in my horse's stable,

37:12.689 --> 37:14.316
and he cut himself.

37:17.778 --> 37:19.112
If you're a stranger
to our land,

37:19.196 --> 37:20.697
you may not know
the superstition.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.324
The lady of the lake.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.202
They say she heals
sick animals.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.037
It's an old story,
but a good excuse

37:27.120 --> 37:28.830
for a night-time ride.

37:29.998 --> 37:32.084
Well, it's not
looking any worse.

37:38.131 --> 37:40.258
You're one of Arthur's men.

37:44.471 --> 37:45.931
I am.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.684
So he's already
in the country.

37:50.018 --> 37:52.312
Is he the great warlord
everyone says he is?

37:53.397 --> 37:56.274
Mm. I think so.

37:56.358 --> 37:58.402
But I would.

37:58.485 --> 38:01.655
I've heard
he's never lost a battle.

38:01.738 --> 38:03.281
Not when I was there.

38:03.365 --> 38:04.992
What's his secret?

38:06.493 --> 38:08.286
You'll have to ask him.

38:10.330 --> 38:12.833
His idea of an alliance
between the British Kingdoms

38:12.916 --> 38:15.585
is inspired,
if he can make it work.

38:15.669 --> 38:18.380
What are the obstacles
he might come up against?

38:20.007 --> 38:22.300
Here we fear the Irish
more than the Saxon.

38:23.093 --> 38:25.762
They raid our coastlines,
take our land,

38:25.846 --> 38:27.431
cover their shields
in blood,

38:27.514 --> 38:29.766
and yell like mad things.

38:29.850 --> 38:31.685
They don't have methods
and systems

38:31.768 --> 38:33.603
like the Saxons, though.

38:33.687 --> 38:35.439
You're interested in war?

38:35.522 --> 38:38.275
My family lost our lands
to Diwrnach,

38:38.358 --> 38:39.651
an Irish lord.

38:39.735 --> 38:41.028
I'm sorry.

38:41.111 --> 38:43.447
If I was a man,
I'd win them back.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.532
As it is, I have to try
and persuade King Gorfydd

38:45.615 --> 38:47.159
to do it for me.

38:48.952 --> 38:51.121
Are you surprised
he's agreed to marry

38:51.204 --> 38:52.831
his daughter to Arthur?

38:52.914 --> 38:54.624
He's a tactician.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.585
He'll be thinking
four steps ahead.

38:57.627 --> 39:00.881
It could be worse for her.
Arthur's at least young,

39:00.964 --> 39:02.841
and they say he's handsome.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.845
[laughing]

39:08.930 --> 39:10.432
You are Arthur!

39:13.769 --> 39:16.021
-I am.
-How dare you trick me!

39:16.104 --> 39:18.982
-You made a fool of me!
-No--

39:19.066 --> 39:21.276
-It was dishonorable of you.
-Don't go.

39:29.785 --> 39:31.369
[nickering]

39:33.330 --> 39:35.957
I came to this lake
for a reason.

39:41.922 --> 39:44.424
I lost my best friend,
I killed him.

39:45.842 --> 39:48.095
And whenever
I close my eyes,

39:48.178 --> 39:50.138
I see his face.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.560
What happened?

39:55.644 --> 39:57.229
He stole.

40:00.190 --> 40:02.901
And he killed
the people that he stole from.

40:04.778 --> 40:07.030
Then he lied about it.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.949
To you?

40:09.032 --> 40:10.784
Yes.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.911
Then he wasn't
your best friend,

40:12.994 --> 40:14.371
and you must know that
in your heart.

40:14.454 --> 40:17.165
It doesn't stop me
from thinking about him.

40:20.961 --> 40:22.921
He died in my arms.

40:23.713 --> 40:24.965
Imagine,

40:25.048 --> 40:26.758
if you hadn't killed him,

40:26.842 --> 40:28.718
because you couldn't do it,

40:28.802 --> 40:30.345
how would you be
feeling now?

40:31.805 --> 40:33.431
Compromised.

40:34.349 --> 40:37.060
I don't know you,
Arthur Ap Neb,

40:37.144 --> 40:38.895
but it seems to me
you're not a man

40:38.979 --> 40:41.106
to live with compromise.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.318
Who are you?

40:47.195 --> 40:49.030
I'm not someone who matters.

40:51.908 --> 40:53.952
[nickering]

41:07.340 --> 41:09.384
Where can I find you?

41:40.123 --> 41:41.917
[Lanval] Arthur!

41:46.713 --> 41:48.340
Where have you been?

41:49.382 --> 41:53.428
I... went for a walk.

41:56.264 --> 41:58.433
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

41:59.809 --> 42:01.811
I thought they'd taken you.

42:01.895 --> 42:04.314
Hey, you know,
if anything happens to you,

42:04.397 --> 42:06.608
Saggy would never forgive me.

42:08.735 --> 42:11.029
Well, we can't have that.

42:37.264 --> 42:40.600
Birds that fly together
in the midday sun.

42:40.684 --> 42:43.144
A good omen
for what's to come.

42:57.784 --> 42:59.911
[man] Open the gates!

42:59.995 --> 43:01.746
[thudding]

43:21.516 --> 43:23.435
Well, Derfel,
what do you think?

43:27.230 --> 43:29.607
-It's different to Caer Cadarn.
-Heh.

43:32.402 --> 43:34.988
Arthur and his men

43:35.071 --> 43:38.199
come to us in peace.

43:40.076 --> 43:42.370
They are our guests.

43:43.330 --> 43:45.248
Take his banner.

43:45.332 --> 43:47.792
Put it next
to the Eagle of Powys.

44:01.264 --> 44:04.267
[softly]
Fifty-two...

44:04.351 --> 44:06.394
At least he's young.

44:07.270 --> 44:09.147
And handsome.

44:13.693 --> 44:17.155
What if I don't...
if he doesn't like me?

44:18.531 --> 44:20.700
He's lucky to be
getting betrothed to you.

44:20.784 --> 44:23.536
You're Princess Ceinwyn
of Powys.

44:23.620 --> 44:26.664
Every king in Britain
wants to wed you.

44:34.130 --> 44:35.882
Where are the rest of the men?

44:35.965 --> 44:39.135
They're setting up camp,
just outside the walls.

44:39.219 --> 44:41.012
One of us will be here

44:41.096 --> 44:42.764
each night
to guard your room.

44:47.143 --> 44:49.396
Gorfydd was clear.
We come in peace.

44:49.479 --> 44:51.231
My Lord Arthur,

44:51.314 --> 44:52.732
I always come in peace.
[laughing]

44:52.816 --> 44:54.734
Still, best
to take precautions.

44:54.818 --> 44:56.277
-Mm?
-Mm.

45:01.408 --> 45:03.410
[soft whispers]

45:06.246 --> 45:08.540
Very nice,
very handsome, huh?

45:13.086 --> 45:14.796
You look good,
My Lord.

45:15.630 --> 45:18.091
Tonight is just the betrothal,
is that right, Bedwin?

45:18.174 --> 45:20.009
Yes. We must wait
for the moon to wax

45:20.093 --> 45:22.345
before Arthur and Ceinwyn can
exchange their rings

45:22.429 --> 45:24.722
-and be officially wed.
-Ahh.

45:33.106 --> 45:34.691
Are you not well,
My Lord?

45:34.774 --> 45:37.152
It's the smell of the incense.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.078
Derfel.

45:48.121 --> 45:50.665
You must present this
to Princess Ceinwyn.

45:51.833 --> 45:53.209
Me?

45:53.293 --> 45:54.794
My friend must give
the bride-to-be

45:54.878 --> 45:57.797
her betrothal gift.
Tradition.

45:57.881 --> 45:59.716
[laughs]
So, the death pit boy's

45:59.799 --> 46:01.301
your friend now.
That's very nice.

46:01.384 --> 46:03.428
Princess Ceinwyn is
very young.

46:04.471 --> 46:05.805
Same age as you, Derfel.

46:06.848 --> 46:08.933
Might make her feel
at ease.

46:13.521 --> 46:15.773
[footsteps]

46:22.530 --> 46:26.326
-Yes?
-Yes.

46:36.503 --> 46:38.838
Your mother would be
proud of you.

46:38.922 --> 46:41.007
You've made me who I am.

46:41.090 --> 46:43.176
Are you proud of me?

46:43.259 --> 46:44.719
Very.

46:46.012 --> 46:50.016
This won't change
anything between us.

46:50.099 --> 46:53.102
You'll share your secrets
with your husband,

46:53.186 --> 46:54.854
and he'll share his with you.

46:54.938 --> 46:58.107
You're the person
who knows me best in the world,

46:58.191 --> 47:00.318
and it will stay that way.

47:01.736 --> 47:03.530
I'll find your father.

47:09.369 --> 47:11.412
[door opening]

47:16.960 --> 47:19.671
-[knocking on door]
-[door opening]

47:26.219 --> 47:27.971
She's ready.

47:28.054 --> 47:31.015
-How is she?
-Nervous.

47:36.312 --> 47:38.565
She's young to wed...

47:38.648 --> 47:41.067
but this is an opportunity.

47:41.150 --> 47:43.486
-The alliance.
-I don't fear the Saxon

47:43.570 --> 47:45.029
like Arthur does.

47:45.113 --> 47:47.949
This new leader Aelle is
a worry, but...

47:49.492 --> 47:51.661
benefits
of this marriage...

47:51.744 --> 47:54.372
gives me a foothold
in Dumnonia.

47:56.165 --> 47:59.335
Now, Ceinwyn will need people
with her in Caer Cadarn.

47:59.419 --> 48:01.546
Sharp eyes and ears.

48:01.629 --> 48:03.172
You will go as her lady.

48:03.256 --> 48:05.967
-I can't.
-Why not?

48:07.093 --> 48:08.845
Her lady-in-waiting
should be married.

48:08.928 --> 48:11.431
Well, we'll get
one of his men to wed you.

48:13.433 --> 48:15.018
My King...

48:15.101 --> 48:17.895
you swore an oath
to my father to protect me.

48:19.272 --> 48:21.441
I have offered you much.

48:22.525 --> 48:24.444
And I've respected you

48:24.527 --> 48:27.030
when you've rejected
those offers.

48:27.113 --> 48:30.700
I'm not a man
to force myself on any woman.

48:30.783 --> 48:33.453
-You know my reason.
-Mm-hm.

48:33.536 --> 48:35.079
I've always
looked up to you,

48:35.163 --> 48:37.749
respected you
like a second father.

48:40.668 --> 48:42.837
I have been patient.

48:44.047 --> 48:46.382
I have been forgiving.

48:46.466 --> 48:48.009
Yes.

48:49.052 --> 48:53.348
All I ask...
is something in return.

48:55.308 --> 48:58.144
You will join Ceinwyn...

48:58.227 --> 49:00.438
in her new life.

49:06.569 --> 49:08.529
[soft footsteps]

49:20.166 --> 49:21.834
My King.

49:21.918 --> 49:23.628
My daughter.

49:27.423 --> 49:29.133
Are you happy?

49:30.510 --> 49:34.138
If you are,
Father... I am.

49:50.196 --> 49:52.198
Are you coming?

49:52.281 --> 49:54.200
You look cold.

49:54.283 --> 49:56.077
Let me fetch you a shawl.

50:01.624 --> 50:04.585
[laughter]

50:21.227 --> 50:22.854
Bedwin.

50:27.734 --> 50:29.861
Arthur?

50:30.778 --> 50:32.405
Am I right to do this?

50:32.488 --> 50:34.449
Of course you are.

50:35.950 --> 50:38.661
You're nervous, that's all.
It's perfectly normal.

[doors creaks open]

50:44.167 --> 50:47.587
[chatter fades]

50:55.261 --> 50:57.221
[doors close]

51:38.054 --> 51:40.640
Arthur Ap Neb...

51:40.723 --> 51:44.393
this is a gift from me...

51:44.477 --> 51:45.770
to you.

51:56.656 --> 51:58.616
This is my gift to you.

52:18.344 --> 52:20.429
Sucellos...

52:20.513 --> 52:24.600
the God of protection...

52:24.684 --> 52:26.519
and Rosmerta,

52:26.602 --> 52:30.273
the golden Goddess
of fertility...

52:30.356 --> 52:31.983
shield...

52:33.776 --> 52:36.571
...and embrace this couple.

52:44.203 --> 52:47.832
[applause]

52:54.547 --> 52:58.009
[melancholy music]

53:13.733 --> 53:15.776
[exhaling]

53:26.662 --> 53:29.248
[soft chatter]

53:33.336 --> 53:36.213
What a handsome couple
you make.

53:37.256 --> 53:39.008
Now we'll wait
for the auguries to be good

53:39.091 --> 53:40.968
before the exchange
of wedding rings.

53:42.678 --> 53:45.431
You'll find we're very good
hosts in Powys, Arthur.

53:45.514 --> 53:47.767
We like to eat,

53:47.850 --> 53:50.811
-and drink, and dance.
-[doors closing]

53:51.687 --> 53:53.439
I'm a poor dancer.

53:53.522 --> 53:55.191
I'm sure
that's not true.

53:55.274 --> 53:57.693
Well, you'll have
to teach him, Ceinwyn.

53:57.777 --> 53:59.737
[laughing]

54:06.786 --> 54:10.748
This is Lady Guinevere
of Henis Wyren.

54:10.831 --> 54:12.625
She's like my sister.

54:12.708 --> 54:14.126
Been brought up together.

54:14.210 --> 54:16.420
Well, Guinevere brought me up.

54:20.132 --> 54:23.427
You must love each other,
for my sake.

54:31.310 --> 54:33.104
Lady Guinevere.

54:43.823 --> 54:47.034
[spirited music]
