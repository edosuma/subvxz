WEBVTT

00:09.909 --> 00:12.112
YOU'RE JUST NOW
REMEMBERING

00:12.178 --> 00:15.548
WHO TORCHED YOUR
SORRY ASS, HMM ?

00:15.615 --> 00:20.420
TIME FOR YOU TO LEARN SOMETHING
FROM ALL THIS, SPAWN.

00:20.487 --> 00:23.089
NO ONE
CAN BE TRUSTED.

00:23.156 --> 00:26.493
I NEED THOSE GUNS
OFF THE STREET, CHAPEL.

00:26.559 --> 00:29.662
THAT ORDNANCE
IS TRACEABLE TO<i> ME.</i>

00:29.729 --> 00:31.331
TONIGHT.

00:35.335 --> 00:36.436
WANDA ?

00:36.503 --> 00:37.337
( gasps )

00:37.404 --> 00:40.006
I FORGOT SOMETHING.

00:41.941 --> 00:43.777
I LOVE YOU.

00:43.843 --> 00:45.345
I LOVE YOU,
TERRY.

00:45.412 --> 00:47.147
OH, MY GOD !

00:48.481 --> 00:51.684
WELL, WHAT
HAVE WE HERE ?

00:51.751 --> 00:53.086
I REMEMBER YOU.

00:53.153 --> 00:54.220
SIMMONS ?

00:55.288 --> 00:57.757
KILL ME,
FINISH IT !

00:57.824 --> 01:00.460
THERE'S NO
COMING BACK.

01:00.527 --> 01:02.429
NO...

01:02.495 --> 01:04.431
I'M GONNA
LET YOU LIVE

01:04.497 --> 01:06.833
LONGER THAN
YOU WANT TO.

01:10.136 --> 01:11.838
( loud thunder )

01:43.703 --> 01:44.771
NO !

02:06.326 --> 02:09.829
WHEN AL SIMMONS DIED,
HE MADE A DEAL WITH HELL.

02:09.896 --> 02:12.398
HE'D HARVEST AS MANY SOULS
AS THEY WANTED

02:12.465 --> 02:15.902
IF HE COULD COME BACK TO EARTH
FOR THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.937
SO THEY RETURNED HIM

02:18.004 --> 02:20.206
WITH THE DECAYED
FLESH OF THE DEAD,

02:20.273 --> 02:22.542
AND A FACE
THAT WAS ROTTING.

02:23.409 --> 02:26.446
OH, AND ONE
OTHER LITTLE TRICK.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.448
AL WAITED
FIVE LONG YEARS,

02:28.515 --> 02:31.084
SO THE LOVE HE CAME BACK FOR,
SHE WAS GONE,

02:31.150 --> 02:32.752
MOVED ON WITH
HER LIFE.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.888
NOW REMARRIED
TO HIS BEST FRIEND.

02:40.793 --> 02:42.195
SEE...

02:42.262 --> 02:44.731
IT'S ALL JUST SOME
SADISTIC CRUEL JOKE.

02:44.797 --> 02:47.600
BUT, AL,
HE'S NOT LAUGHING.

02:50.870 --> 02:53.306
( Cogliostro )
BORN OUT OF DARKNESS.

02:53.373 --> 02:55.441
A HELL SPAWN
IS ISOLATED,

02:55.508 --> 02:58.111
CONFUSED,
TORMENTED.

02:58.177 --> 03:02.415
HE FINDS NO SOLACE
IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS.

03:02.482 --> 03:05.418
THEY ARE DISTORTED,
TWISTED, GROTESQUE.

03:05.485 --> 03:08.888
WHATEVER FRAGMENTS
OF MEMORIES THAT REMAIN

03:08.955 --> 03:11.457
ARE NOT HIS OWN.

03:11.524 --> 03:14.027
THEY ARE INTRUDERS.

03:14.093 --> 03:17.630
MEMORIES
ARE HIS ENEMY.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.900
OH, I ALWAYS
WANTED YOU, WANDA.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.802
OH TERRY,

03:22.869 --> 03:25.738
YOU'RE MORE OF A MAN
THAN AL EVER WAS.

03:25.805 --> 03:28.942
I'M GLAD WE GOT RID OF
THAT SONOFABITCH.

03:29.008 --> 03:31.844
OH, GOD !

03:32.912 --> 03:34.314
TERRY.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.648
( giggling )

03:38.351 --> 03:39.652
NO !

03:45.758 --> 03:48.261
STAY OUT OF
MY DREAMS !

03:48.328 --> 03:50.363
<i>YOUR</i> DREAMS ?

03:50.430 --> 03:54.200
MALEBOLGIA
OWNS YOU.

03:54.267 --> 03:57.737
YOU ARE
HIS BITCH.

03:57.804 --> 04:00.139
YOU DON'T
HAVE SHIT.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.675
NOTHING BUT
A CHEAP SUIT

04:02.742 --> 04:05.511
AND A BAD
COMPLEXION.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.683
DON'T YOU GET IT,
SPAWNY ?

04:10.750 --> 04:13.486
YOUR FRIENDS
ALL FUCKED YOU.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.455
THIS IS GETTING
EMBARRASSING,

04:15.521 --> 04:18.057
THIS WANDA FETISH
YOU HAVE.

04:18.124 --> 04:19.392
( laughing )

04:22.895 --> 04:26.299
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR HER NAME
FROM YOUR FILTHY MOUTH !

04:27.600 --> 04:31.904
WANDA, WANDA, WANDA !

04:36.876 --> 04:38.144
YES !

04:38.211 --> 04:41.247
NICE SHOT,
SPAWN.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.686
OH, BUT I THINK
YOU'RE DEALING

04:46.753 --> 04:48.688
WITH SOME MISPLACED
ANGER HERE.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.623
DON'T GET
PISSED AT<i> ME.</i>

04:50.690 --> 04:53.493
I'M THE ONE
WHO'S HELPING YOU OUT.

04:53.559 --> 04:56.763
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO STOLE YOUR WIFE.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.865
BUT, HEY,
THINK ABOUT IT.

04:58.931 --> 05:00.967
JUST HOW WELL

05:01.034 --> 05:04.170
DID YOU KNOW
TERRY ANYWAY ?

05:07.073 --> 05:08.107
TERRY...

05:10.777 --> 05:14.280
( male )
WHY DON'T WE HAVE FITZGERALD
SHAKE HANDS WITH MR. RIMERE ?

05:14.347 --> 05:16.382
THEY'RE SUCH
OLD FRIENDS.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.284
( male )
WHAT ARE WE REALLY
LOOKING AT HERE ?

05:18.351 --> 05:20.019
( male )
A TRAITOR,
MR. BURGEON.

05:20.086 --> 05:21.821
AND HE'S ABOUT
TO BE DEALT WITH.

05:21.888 --> 05:25.024
WHAT SOME MEN WILL DO
FOR MONEY IS A TRAVESTY,

05:25.091 --> 05:28.227
SELLING MISSILES
TO A KNOWN TERRORIST.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.096
THE VOICE ?

05:30.163 --> 05:32.832
THE VOICE IS EASIER
THAN THE VISUAL, MR. WYNN.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.300
PSYCHOLOGICAL
PROFILE ?

05:34.367 --> 05:36.202
PARANOID,
DELUSIONAL.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.204
IT READS LIKE
A GREEK TRAGEDY.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.773
SHAME HOW QUICKLY A MAN
CAN CRASH AND BURN.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.709
SPLENDID OBSERVATION,
BURGEON.

05:42.775 --> 05:44.377
I SUGGEST YOU
KEEP IT IN MIND,

05:44.444 --> 05:46.746
SHOULD YOU EVER BE TEMPTED
TO SHOP YOUR SKILLS.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.981
I'M AWARE OF
YOUR REPUTATION, SIR.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.117
OF COURSE,
YOU ARE.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.120
YOUR FEE HAS
ALREADY BEEN WIRED.

05:58.291 --> 05:59.659
( phone )

06:08.534 --> 06:09.736
YES ?

06:09.802 --> 06:11.337
( male )
Fitzgerald's
on the loose.

06:11.404 --> 06:14.373
I WANT MY MISSILES MOVED OUT
OF THAT WAREHOUSE TONIGHT.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.708
But, but--

06:15.775 --> 06:17.076
RIGHT NOW.

06:17.143 --> 06:20.213
MERRICK WILL HAVE
COORDINATES FOR DELIVERY.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.516
OH, AND, UM,

06:23.583 --> 06:26.018
SEND ME LEON NOW.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.021
FITZGERALD IS
A TRAITOR.

06:29.088 --> 06:31.224
AND HOW DOES OUR AGENCY
HANDLE TRAITORS ?

06:31.290 --> 06:33.726
THEY'RE
LIQUIDATED.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.263
I WANT YOU TO USE LEON
AND THAT HILLBILLY KID.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.332
I DON'T TRUST
THAT HILLBILLY.

06:39.398 --> 06:41.367
HE WORKED FOR
THE RUSSIAN MOB.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.302
<i> I</i> TRUST HIM.

06:55.281 --> 06:55.882
( gasps )

06:55.948 --> 06:56.816
HI.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.954
YOU'VE BEEN GONE
FOR HOURS, BABY,
WHAT'S WRONG ?

07:02.021 --> 07:04.724
I'VE BEEN WALKING AROUND,
THINKING.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.827
I JUST-- I WANTED
TO SEE YOU AND CYAN

07:07.894 --> 07:11.164
AND TELL YOU THAT I MIGHT
BE GONE A FEW DAYS.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.598
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

07:12.665 --> 07:17.670
I FEEL LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE
IS COLLAPSING AROUND ME.

07:17.737 --> 07:19.539
TERRY,
TALK TO ME.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.007
I'M TIRED.

07:21.073 --> 07:23.376
I'M JUST SO TIRED,
I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT.

07:23.442 --> 07:24.510
I GOTTA GO.

07:24.577 --> 07:25.444
NOW ?!

07:25.511 --> 07:27.146
TERRY,
IT'S THREE O'CLOCK.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.415
YOU HAVE A WIFE
AND A CHILD.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.184
LET SOMEONE ELSE
TAKE CARE OF IT.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.351
I'M ALL ALONE
ON THIS.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.086
YOU'RE DOING FIELDWORK,
LIKE AL DID.

07:34.153 --> 07:36.756
DON'T LAY THAT
ON ME, WANDA.

07:36.823 --> 07:37.990
YOU GOTTA TRUST ME.

07:38.057 --> 07:39.292
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

07:39.358 --> 07:40.359
TRUST ?!

07:40.426 --> 07:42.328
DON'T ASK A WIDOW
FOR BLIND TRUST.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.330
I TRUST WITH
MY EYES WIDE OPEN.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.133
SO YOU BETTER TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW !

07:47.200 --> 07:48.334
( Terry )
I CAN'T !

07:48.401 --> 07:50.069
I'M TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.938
( Wanda )
Al used to say
the same thing.

07:52.004 --> 07:54.207
You're not protecting me,
you're scaring me.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.843
I won't raise a fatherless
child, Terry.

07:56.909 --> 07:58.811
( Al )
Thanks for
all the support.

07:58.878 --> 08:00.446
I have to go.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.587
HE'S ENROUTE.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.134
( screaming )

08:23.970 --> 08:25.605
WHERE'S HE GOING ?

08:26.706 --> 08:28.941
ON THE WAY
TO THE WAREHOUSE.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.543
YOU WON'T
BE KILLING HIM.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.345
HE'S MINE.

08:32.411 --> 08:33.779
( screaming )

08:45.892 --> 08:47.793
HEY, BUDDY,
YOU OKAY ?

08:49.295 --> 08:51.497
HOLY SHIT.

08:57.970 --> 08:59.505
UNIT TWELVE,
UNIT TWELVE.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.141
I NEED BACKUP,
RIVERSIDE AND 110th.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.442
( sirens )

09:04.577 --> 09:07.113
( male )
TEN OF OURS
TO BRING IN ONE GUY ?

09:07.179 --> 09:08.514
WHAT IS HE,
DUSTED ?

09:08.581 --> 09:10.116
NO DRUGS
IN HIS SYSTEM.

09:10.182 --> 09:11.918
THE DOCTOR
SEEMS TO FEEL

09:11.984 --> 09:13.686
THERE'S SOME SORT
OF BRAIN DAMAGE.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.488
SHIT, WHERE'D THEY
PICK THIS GUY UP ?

09:15.554 --> 09:17.690
THE ALLEYS WHERE WE'RE
INVESTIGATING THOSE MURDERS.

09:17.757 --> 09:19.125
COINCIDENCE ?

09:19.191 --> 09:20.860
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN COINCIDENCES.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.328
NEITHER
DO I, SIR.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.030
NOT DOWN THERE.

09:24.096 --> 09:25.698
SHIT !

09:25.765 --> 09:28.701
WELL,<i> THERE'S</i>
THE PROBLEM RIGHT THERE.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.770
HE USES
TOO MUCH MAKEUP.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.438
THAT CAN DRIVE
A GUY NUTS.

09:33.739 --> 09:37.143
RITUALISTIC MARKINGS,
VERY PRIMAL, YES.

09:37.209 --> 09:39.378
AFRICAN WARRIORS
USE SIMILAR MARKINGS.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.280
THE SKULL
SIGNIFIES DEATH.

09:41.347 --> 09:42.782
LOOKS MILITARY.

09:42.848 --> 09:44.650
SPECIAL FORCES
TRAINING.

09:44.717 --> 09:46.552
NO TAGS.

09:46.619 --> 09:48.521
MERCENARY,
MAYBE.

09:48.587 --> 09:50.556
HIS FINGERPRINTS
HAVE BEEN BURNED OFF.

09:50.623 --> 09:53.326
IT'LL BE HARD TO MAKE
A POSITIVE I.D.

09:53.392 --> 09:56.162
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT OURSELVES
A REAL PRO.

09:57.229 --> 09:58.631
AL ?

10:06.238 --> 10:07.173
CHRIST !

10:08.207 --> 10:09.408
NO !

10:10.509 --> 10:12.078
( screaming )

10:13.612 --> 10:15.348
I KILLED HIM !

10:15.414 --> 10:17.383
DO YOU HEAR ME ?
I KILLED HIM !

10:17.450 --> 10:20.386
DO YOU HEAR ME ?
I KILLED HIM !

10:20.453 --> 10:22.421
CONFESSIONS
OF A FRUITCAKE,

10:22.488 --> 10:23.723
PROBABLY NOTHING.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.325
CHECK THE ALLEYS
FOR ANOTHER BODY ANYWAY.

10:48.547 --> 10:49.749
( phone )

10:50.783 --> 10:52.018
YES ?

10:52.084 --> 10:54.387
WE JUST PICKED UP
ONE OF YOUR BOYS.

10:54.453 --> 10:57.523
A TRIGGER MAN WITH
A SKULL PAINTED ON HIS FACE

10:57.590 --> 10:58.958
SOUND FAMILIAR ?

10:59.025 --> 11:00.426
I WANT HIM
CUT LOOSE.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.228
I DON'T THINK
YOU DO.

11:02.294 --> 11:04.697
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN
THROUGH A WAR.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.565
THE GUY'S A FUCKING
TIME BOMB.

11:06.632 --> 11:09.735
ALRIGHT,
I'LL ATTEND TO IT MYSELF.

11:10.636 --> 11:11.737
CHAPEL,

11:11.804 --> 11:14.306
ANOTHER
DISAPPOINTMENT.

11:20.279 --> 11:22.415
( tires screeching )

11:55.815 --> 11:58.017
( car doors closing )

12:01.020 --> 12:02.455
WHO THE FUCK
ARE YOU ?

12:02.521 --> 12:04.824
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF ME !

12:08.360 --> 12:11.130
SELLING ARMS
TO A TERRORIST,

12:11.197 --> 12:14.233
THAT WAS AN IMPROPER THING
TO DO, MR. FITZGERALD.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.168
THIS IS
BULLSHIT !

12:16.235 --> 12:18.704
OF COURSE, IT IS.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.407
ANYTHING MORE
TO SAY ?

12:25.878 --> 12:28.380
( Terry )
YOU CAN'T JUST--

12:28.447 --> 12:31.817
YOU JUST
RESISTED ARREST.

12:39.959 --> 12:40.559
( screaming )

12:40.626 --> 12:42.361
HOLY SHIT !

12:52.571 --> 12:54.473
( man screaming )

13:00.746 --> 13:02.781
CALL IN
"B" TEAM.

13:02.848 --> 13:05.451
FITZGERALD'S
GOT BACKUP.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.294
HELLO, LEON.

13:48.360 --> 13:52.031
HE'S GOT HELP,
KILL BOTH OF THEM.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.735
( tv )
Are you guys
ready for this ?

13:56.802 --> 13:59.405
Do you want to get
the hottest abs around... ?

14:01.907 --> 14:03.642
... and your butt,
perfect.

14:03.709 --> 14:06.178
MOVE AWAY
FROM THE DESK.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.649
NOW, DROP YOUR
GUN BELT

14:10.716 --> 14:13.552
AND PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.389
HOW MANY
PEOPLE ARE HERE ?

14:17.456 --> 14:19.458
JUST A COUPLE
THIS SHIFT.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.327
IT'S MOSTLY AUTOMATED.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.195
( phone )

14:25.164 --> 14:27.600
( Merrick )
CUT THE PHONES
AND THE SECURITY.

14:27.666 --> 14:29.235
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A PIECE OF ACTION.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.270
NOW SUDDENLY WE HAVE
A BUILDING

14:31.337 --> 14:33.339
I HAVE NO BLUEPRINTS FOR,
MERRICK.

14:33.405 --> 14:36.842
I'LL BE YOUR
EYES AND EARS, LEON.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.880
I DON'T LIKE A WOMAN
WATCHING MY BACK,
THEY'RE TOO SOFT.

14:41.947 --> 14:43.115
NOT MERRICK.

14:43.182 --> 14:45.451
WE DID A HARD CONTRACT
AGAINST THE RUSSIAN MOB.

14:45.517 --> 14:47.253
SHE GOT HIT
AND LEFT BEHIND.

14:47.319 --> 14:49.154
THEY USED HER BADLY.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.357
( male )
I'D LIKE TO USE
HER BADLY.

14:51.423 --> 14:53.292
( Leon )
YOU TALK TOO MUCH.

14:53.359 --> 14:54.760
SHIT !

14:54.827 --> 14:56.228
HEY, WAIT !

14:59.298 --> 15:00.866
OH, SHIT !

15:11.343 --> 15:13.912
I GOTTA FIND
THOSE MISSILES.

15:17.116 --> 15:19.351
IT'S THE ONLY WAY OUT
OF THIS MESS.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.186
COME ON, COME ON.

15:22.988 --> 15:24.890
THEY GOTTA BE HERE.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.192
YES !

15:27.259 --> 15:29.094
I'VE GOT 'EM.

15:29.161 --> 15:30.429

15:49.548 --> 15:51.383
( footsteps )

15:53.619 --> 15:54.486
( guns cocking )

15:54.553 --> 15:55.788
SHIT !

16:22.781 --> 16:25.417
HEY, HEY, YOU GOTTA
CALL THE POLICE !

16:28.520 --> 16:29.655
LADY ?

16:57.349 --> 17:00.185
( Merrick on intercom )
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU BOYS
HAVE NOTICED,

17:00.252 --> 17:02.221
BUT OUR TARGET
IS ABOUT TO ESCAPE.

17:02.287 --> 17:04.189
IF YOU TAKE YOUR THUMBS
OUT OF YOUR ASSES,

17:04.256 --> 17:06.191
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE
TO CATCH HIM.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.173
( male )
HE'S UP THERE.

17:57.876 --> 18:01.880
( male )
THIS OLD BOY'S A HARD DOG
TO KEEP UNDER THE PORCH.

18:16.061 --> 18:17.896
WHEN I CATCH THIS
LITTLE JACKRABBIT,

18:17.963 --> 18:19.932
I'M GONNA
SKIN HIM.

18:22.234 --> 18:24.903
( Leon )
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
THIS GUY.

18:24.970 --> 18:26.572
HE'S A BOY SCOUT.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.707
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S GONNA DO NEXT.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.375
( male )
I KNOW SOME OF
THOSE RUSSIANS.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.877
WHO WERE THEY ?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.712
( Leon )
DON'T KNOW, AFTER MERRICK
WAS DONE WITH THEM,

18:33.779 --> 18:36.248
THEY COULDN'T
IDENTIFY THE BODIES.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.459
JESUS.

18:50.996 --> 18:52.631
I WAS JUST DOING
MY JOB, GODDAMNIT !

18:52.698 --> 18:54.633
WHY ARE THEY
DOING THIS TO ME ?!

20:13.712 --> 20:15.113
HEY, LITTLE RABBIT.

20:15.180 --> 20:17.683
YOU DOWN
THAT RABBIT HOLE ?

20:27.326 --> 20:31.029
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ?
POP HIM !

20:31.096 --> 20:33.799
THE ASSHOLE
TOOK YOUR OLD LADY.

20:33.865 --> 20:36.735
HE TORCHED YOU,
YOU DUMB SHIT.

20:36.802 --> 20:41.206
AS SURE AS IF IT WAS
HIS HAND ON THE TORCH.

20:41.273 --> 20:43.909
HE NEEDED YOU GONE.

20:45.110 --> 20:46.678
COME ON.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.914
IF EVER
THERE WAS A MOTIVE

20:48.981 --> 20:51.350
THAT EVERY-FUCKING-BODY
UNDERSTANDS,

20:51.416 --> 20:55.454
IT WAS,
"HE TOOK MY WOMAN".

20:55.520 --> 20:58.390
I NEED HIM ALIVE

20:58.457 --> 21:01.560
UNTIL I KNOW
THE TRUTH.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.031
( laughing )

21:08.767 --> 21:10.268
LET'S SEE...

21:10.335 --> 21:13.171
"BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN
DESIRES GENEROUS MAN

21:13.238 --> 21:15.307
FOR NEW SITUATION."

21:15.374 --> 21:17.209
NOT BAD.

21:20.579 --> 21:22.714
OPEN VAULT 73

21:22.781 --> 21:24.850
AND THEN GO FOR THE COPS.

21:43.669 --> 21:44.703
( beeping )

22:16.001 --> 22:17.569
THERE IT IS.

22:19.137 --> 22:20.939
HOLY SHIT !

22:21.006 --> 22:24.109
THESE ARE THE NUMBERS,
THE NUMBERS MATCH.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.446
JESUS,
WYNN IS A TRAITOR.

22:30.148 --> 22:31.016
GOT HIM.

22:36.288 --> 22:37.389
( gunshots )

22:42.060 --> 22:44.229
TOO BAD, LITTLE LADY,
WRONG TURN.

23:12.491 --> 23:14.326
GIVE ME THE TRUTH !

23:22.868 --> 23:24.736
AL, IF I KNEW
WHO DID IT,

23:24.803 --> 23:26.638
I'D TAKE HIM DOWN.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.540
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER BUDDY,
I PROMISE.

23:28.607 --> 23:30.375
GOOD LUCK UP THERE.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.380
IT'S TRUE.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.916
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.155
THIS HAS ALL BEEN
VERY MESSY.

23:43.221 --> 23:45.257
I KEEP A CLEAN HOUSE.

23:45.323 --> 23:46.658
LEAVE...

23:46.725 --> 23:49.227
OR WE ALL GO.

23:50.428 --> 23:53.198
I'VE GOT
NOTHING TO LOSE.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.567
YOU WON'T DO IT.

23:55.634 --> 23:59.671
YOU DON'T HAVE THE BALLS,
DESK JOCKEY.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.377
THAT'S YOUR WHOLE PROBLEM,
YOU'RE JUST NOT THE TYPE.

24:12.350 --> 24:14.386
( Merrick )
GODDAMNIT !

24:37.008 --> 24:38.610
SO<i> WHAT</i> ?

24:38.677 --> 24:40.846
SO YOU GAVE HIM
PERMISSION.

24:40.912 --> 24:43.715
SO HE DIDN'T KNOW,
DID HE HAVE TO SCREW HER ?

24:43.782 --> 24:45.550
HE COULD HAVE BEEN
PLATONIC, RIGHT ?

24:45.617 --> 24:49.654
DID HE HAVE TO SLAM IT
TO HER EVERY NIGHT ?!

24:57.529 --> 25:00.498
EVERY YEAR I ASK THEM
TO KEEP HIS GRAVE BETTER

25:00.565 --> 25:03.201
AND EVERY YEAR
THEY LET IT GO TO SEED.

25:04.970 --> 25:07.973
TERRY, DON'T LEAVE ME
THE WAY HE DID.

25:08.039 --> 25:10.742
PROMISE ME,
NO FIELD ASSIGNMENTS.

25:10.809 --> 25:13.044
HEY, I WON'T
LEAVE YOU.

25:13.111 --> 25:16.181
I'M A DESK JOCKEY,
AND I'M PROUD OF IT.

25:16.248 --> 25:19.050
AL WAS
MY BEST FRIEND.

25:19.117 --> 25:21.519
HE ONLY ASKED ME
TO DO ONE THING FOR HIM,

25:21.586 --> 25:23.555
TO TAKE CARE
OF YOU.

25:23.622 --> 25:25.557
I PROMISED HIM
I WOULD.

25:29.828 --> 25:32.097
HE'S LAYING
OVER THERE.

25:44.509 --> 25:47.279
HEY, BOY SCOUT,
YOU MADE THAT FUN.

25:51.983 --> 25:53.752
( screaming )

26:15.440 --> 26:17.242
SHIT !

26:25.450 --> 26:27.085
ARGH... !!

26:55.747 --> 26:58.516
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
DIE ON THIS ROOF.

27:02.020 --> 27:04.222
TAKE CARE OF WANDA

27:04.289 --> 27:06.524
UNTIL I COME FOR HER.

27:12.230 --> 27:15.767
( Cogliostro )
THIS TIME THE HELL SPAWN
KEPT THE DEMONS AT BAY,

27:15.834 --> 27:18.937
BUT HE KNOWS THEY WILL
ALWAYS RETURN

27:19.004 --> 27:21.373
TO TORMENT HIM,

27:21.439 --> 27:25.076
MAKING HIM
BLIND TO THE TRUTH.

27:41.860 --> 27:44.362
YOU LET HIM GO,
WHY ?

27:44.429 --> 27:46.731
WHAT DID YOU SAY ?

27:47.799 --> 27:49.000
YOU !

27:49.067 --> 27:51.603
OLD BUM !

27:51.669 --> 27:53.805
WHEN YOU LET HIM GO,

27:53.872 --> 27:56.007
YOU TOOK A STEP TOWARD
FREEING YOURSELF.

27:56.074 --> 27:57.442
HOW THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW ?!

27:57.509 --> 27:59.444
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ANY OF IT ?!

27:59.511 --> 28:00.979
I KNOW.

28:01.046 --> 28:05.150
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
TOUCHED BY HIS CURSE.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.853
( Spawn )
WHO ARE YOU ?
