00:06.974 --> 00:10.044
[wind blowing]

00:15.015 --> 00:17.385
[somber music playing]

01:00.128 --> 01:01.729
[Bob Beck] A University
of Wyoming student

01:01.762 --> 01:03.897
was out riding
his mountain bike

01:03.931 --> 01:07.468
and he falls down,

01:07.501 --> 01:08.736
looks up,

01:11.405 --> 01:13.974
sees what he thinks
is a scarecrow

01:14.007 --> 01:16.944
or a prank,
just because of Halloween

01:16.977 --> 01:19.213
just around the corner,
which, of course,

01:19.247 --> 01:20.414
this was early October,

01:20.448 --> 01:22.250
and goes over to investigate,

01:22.283 --> 01:24.585
and, of course, was horrified
by what he found.

01:42.370 --> 01:45.005
[Rosie O'Donnell] I can still
see the description of him,

01:45.038 --> 01:47.074
the biker who found him

01:47.175 --> 01:49.176
and thought he was
a scarecrow...

01:50.244 --> 01:53.614
of the deer,

01:53.646 --> 01:57.185
that was keeping him
company all night,

01:57.218 --> 01:59.187
and when he was found,

01:59.187 --> 02:00.988
the deer got up and ran away.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.392
There's just a...

02:04.425 --> 02:08.996
A feeling
of divinity around him.

02:09.029 --> 02:12.200
There's a feeling
of an angelic presence.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.852
[O'Donnell] This is a child
who was loved and adored,

02:31.885 --> 02:35.022
and in every way,
kind of, the boy next door.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.393
This is a sign of rage,
something very personal,

02:39.427 --> 02:41.728
something very terrifying
about that.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.913
How cold he had to have been
tied to that fence

02:59.947 --> 03:01.915
and not found for 18 hours,

03:01.949 --> 03:03.484
and still be alive.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.841
[distant siren wailing]

03:27.875 --> 03:30.444
[Beck] They then took him
to Ivinson Memorial Hospital,

03:30.478 --> 03:32.846
which is the local
Laramie hospital

03:32.880 --> 03:35.816
to try and see
what they could possibly do.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.700
[Beck] It was a mystery
to the officers,

04:26.734 --> 04:28.736
okay, "Who is this person?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.871
Who is Matthew Shepard?"

04:43.984 --> 04:47.488
[somber music playing]

04:47.521 --> 04:50.023
"Hey, Mom,
I'm writing to say hello.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.925
How is everything?

04:53.159 --> 04:55.629
I've been okay,
kinda homesick.

04:55.663 --> 04:58.899
Having trouble with getting
into the swing of things,

04:58.932 --> 05:01.068
but it won't last long,
I hope.

05:03.203 --> 05:07.741
I've been real depressed
and I think it's let-down.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.511
I came back and the weather
was crummy,

05:10.544 --> 05:11.979
and I miss home.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.047
Miss you.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.816
Love, Matt."

05:22.390 --> 05:26.960
[Eric Marcus]
Matthew Wayne Shepard was
born on December 1st, 1976.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.696
And even though
he was a little guy,

05:28.729 --> 05:30.531
he had a huge personality.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.401
Matthew was
a very emotional kid,
very empathetic.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.217
[Judy speaks]

06:32.626 --> 06:33.727
[man chuckling]

06:36.263 --> 06:37.865
My name is Jim Osborn,

06:37.898 --> 06:39.800
and I was a friend
of Matthew Shepard.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.837
The first thing
that I noticed about Matt

06:43.871 --> 06:45.005
is his smile.

06:46.006 --> 06:50.377
He just had this incredible
beaming smile.

06:50.478 --> 06:51.879
My name is Romaine Patterson,

06:51.912 --> 06:54.615
and I was friends
with Matthew Shepard.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.117
Oh, I loved his laugh.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.819
I loved his smile more.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.488
He had a great smile.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.590
It beamed.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.324
[Adam Lambert]
He was young.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.126
Looked like
a sweet innocent guy.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.761
Just looked like a nice kid.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.597
[Osborn] It wasn't
just his mouth.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.398
His eyes would kinda light up

07:11.499 --> 07:13.567
and twinkle or sparkle at you,

07:13.601 --> 07:16.570
and it was like
his whole body smiled at you.

07:21.241 --> 07:24.111
Wyoming is like
a sleepy little town.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.547
The whole state
is one sleep little town.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.217
We're the least
populated state in the union.

07:30.250 --> 07:34.755
We're sort of our own
little galaxy here.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.824
We are geographically
enormous.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.992
We're the 10th largest state
in the country,

07:39.026 --> 07:42.663
but we have
the smallest population.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.234
In 1998, even though
we're watching
Will and Grace,

07:47.267 --> 07:50.170
we are the most conservative
state in America.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.846
[Marcus] Growing up
in the '70s and '80s,

07:58.879 --> 08:00.280
you couldn't be different.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.415
It was a kind of place where,

08:02.449 --> 08:04.585
if you were
a stereotypical cowboy,

08:04.618 --> 08:06.854
working on an oil rig,
you'd fit in.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.990
But it wasn't like growing up
in New York City

08:10.023 --> 08:12.926
or any of the major cities
in the country.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.595
Unfortunately,
the word "faggot"

08:14.628 --> 08:15.929
was sort of a go-to

08:15.963 --> 08:17.430
whether or not
that had anything to do

08:17.464 --> 08:19.567
with your sexuality or not,
that was just a word

08:19.567 --> 08:22.469
that was used to describe
you as like a loser

08:22.570 --> 08:23.704
or you as a different.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.467
[Rannells] I am from Nebraska,

08:54.501 --> 08:56.870
and I graduated
in high school in 1987.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.005
Even though we were...

08:58.038 --> 09:00.140
You know, Matthew and I lived
in very different cities

09:00.173 --> 09:03.944
but it seemed like
he was a kid
that I very easily

09:03.977 --> 09:05.946
would have been friends with,
could have friends with.

09:06.914 --> 09:10.183
He seemed like somebody
a lot of us knew.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.786
He seemed like your friend
in high school

09:12.820 --> 09:14.221
that probably was gay.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.224
[Patterson] There's no denying

09:17.257 --> 09:19.459
that Matthew was gay
and he knew that.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.929
Like, if you looked
at Matthew,

09:21.962 --> 09:23.363
you saw a gay man.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.865
There was not a...

09:24.898 --> 09:26.700
There was not even an ounce
of straight there.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.104
In 1993,
as Matthew was finishing

09:31.138 --> 09:33.106
his sophomore year
of high school,

09:33.140 --> 09:35.242
his dad got a job
with an oil company

09:35.275 --> 09:36.143
in Saudi Arabia.

09:38.646 --> 09:41.682
As Matthew's family began
to move to Saudi Arabia,

09:41.715 --> 09:44.184
Matthew settled on an American
school in Switzerland.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.171
[Marks] So,
in the second semester
of his senior year,

10:04.204 --> 10:06.506
he went with some friends
to Morocco.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.277
Morocco at the time,
wasn't perhaps

10:10.310 --> 10:12.713
the tourist destination
that it is today

10:12.746 --> 10:15.548
and it wasn't known
for being particularly safe.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.887
[Patterson] My understanding
of what happened in Morocco

10:19.920 --> 10:22.355
was that on one
particular evening,

10:22.389 --> 10:26.193
Matthew wanted to go out
and see things.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.661
He didn't think,
"Oh, I should go out

10:27.695 --> 10:30.563
with a group of people
in a place that
I'm unfamiliar with."

10:30.597 --> 10:32.199
He just decided,
"I'm gonna go out.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.466
I'm gonna leave the hotel.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.768
I'm gonna wander around.
I'm gonna look at the shops."

10:34.802 --> 10:36.804
Things like that.
That's something
he totally would have done.

10:37.871 --> 10:42.409
And while he was out,
he was snatched.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.718
[Patterson] In Morocco,
a couple of men took Matthew

10:50.751 --> 10:54.354
to a isolated place
and raped him.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.527
At that time,
the idea that a young gay guy

11:00.560 --> 11:03.263
is raped
by a group of adult men,

11:03.296 --> 11:06.066
people couldn't even fathom
that kind of stuff.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.235
And so, Matthew came back
to the hotel,

11:08.268 --> 11:10.337
you know,
immediately told people.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.239
[Marcus] His parents
were contacted,

11:12.272 --> 11:13.741
the police were notified

11:13.741 --> 11:15.142
but they never found
the attackers.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.309
It was a random attack.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.778
They had no idea who did it.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.580
After the attack,
Matthew changed.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.515
He wasn't himself.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.852
I think what happened
is he lost his sense

11:24.885 --> 11:26.854
of safety in the world.

11:29.356 --> 11:33.160
[Liam Cudmore] Being assaulted
is a traumatizing experience.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.897
Trauma has deep,
lasting impacts

11:36.930 --> 11:39.032
on someone's development,

11:39.066 --> 11:42.135
their social development,
their emotional development,

11:42.169 --> 11:43.837
their spiritual development,

11:43.871 --> 11:45.472
and people
who experienced trauma

11:45.505 --> 11:49.409
are at risk
of feeling suicidal,

11:49.442 --> 11:52.179
having poor mental health
like depression and anxiety.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.350
In 1995, Matthew graduated
from high school,

11:57.384 --> 11:58.886
returned to the US,

11:58.919 --> 12:01.588
and he decided
to come out to his mom.

12:01.621 --> 12:04.524
[Osborn] I definitely think
that Matt felt comfortable

12:04.557 --> 12:06.626
in his skin
and was comfortable being out.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.529
[Marcus] By the early '90s,

12:09.562 --> 12:12.332
you have good things happening
in the cultural world,

12:12.365 --> 12:15.268
with more representation
with gay people.

12:15.302 --> 12:18.105
How many lawyers did you go
to before you called me?

12:18.138 --> 12:19.606
Nine.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.308
You're trying
to get rid of her
because she's gay.

12:21.341 --> 12:26.079
I hadn't really come
to terms with my sexuality
until like 1984, '95.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.881
And then, yes,

12:27.915 --> 12:29.649
Ellen DeGeneres is a thing.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.652
I'm gay.

12:32.685 --> 12:37.090
In the late '90s,
there was a great
kind of boom for gay people.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.592
There was more representation
on television.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.562
Ellen had come out.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.498
People fell in love
with Jack on Will and Grace,

12:45.532 --> 12:49.837
an overtly,
outwardly gay character.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.305
A question
of sexual orientation?

12:53.974 --> 12:56.276
The doctor is in.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.613
I think middle America
was becoming more comfortable,

13:00.647 --> 13:02.449
you know, with the thought
that there are gay people

13:02.482 --> 13:04.952
out there and that they are
just regular people.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.223
And I think that gave Matthew
the sense of security

13:10.257 --> 13:13.093
that he wasn't alone
and that he was in fact safe.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.297
[Marks] Matthew later
bounced around

13:17.330 --> 13:19.299
to a few different places.

13:19.332 --> 13:22.302
He eventually wound up back
in Casper, Wyoming,

13:22.335 --> 13:24.637
his hometown.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.173
[Patterson] I went
to my first year of college

13:26.206 --> 13:28.641
at Casper College
in Casper, Wyoming.

13:28.675 --> 13:32.880
I got to know one
of the instructors on campus.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.214
She called me one day
and she said,

13:34.247 --> 13:37.417
"I got this weird call today
from a therapist.

13:37.450 --> 13:41.688
And he's got a client,
and he would like
to introduce his client

13:41.721 --> 13:43.190
to other young gay people.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.992
Can I send him your way?"

13:45.025 --> 13:47.094
And I said,
"Okay. Sure. Why not?"

13:49.696 --> 13:53.200
And it's this awkward
young man named Matthew.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.801
He's like, "I'm trying
to meet some new people

13:54.902 --> 13:57.337
here in Casper
who are gay too,"

13:57.370 --> 14:00.140
and he was super cute,
but we took him under our wing

14:00.173 --> 14:02.175
and we were like, "Listen,
you're one of us now."

14:06.613 --> 14:09.917
I think depression
was a real issue for Matthew.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.351
I think he was
a manic depressive

14:11.384 --> 14:13.353
so sometimes he was super,
super high

14:13.386 --> 14:14.687
and things were awesome.

14:17.324 --> 14:20.827
[Rannells] "February 23, 1998.

14:20.928 --> 14:23.596
I put the Cherry Creek
to shame tonight.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.199
Walked around in my humble
cute self.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.767
It was fun.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.103
I've really gained
a lot of comfort here."

14:31.538 --> 14:32.739
[Patterson] And then,
there were times were things

14:32.772 --> 14:34.341
were literally the opposite,

14:34.374 --> 14:37.945
where it could not
had been lower for him.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.747
[Rannells] "It's been
a long time since
I've journaled,

14:40.780 --> 14:42.582
but I understand why now.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.485
I'm so depressed."

14:46.819 --> 14:49.522
[Patterson] I think
Matthew really did
try to address

14:49.556 --> 14:52.625
the personal traumas
that he had endured.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.861
He dealt with them the best
that he could,

14:54.962 --> 14:57.597
where he didn't feel bad
about himself,

14:57.630 --> 14:59.332
he didn't blame himself
for the things

14:59.366 --> 15:00.968
that had happened in Morocco.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.602
And he was always, you know,

15:02.635 --> 15:04.504
trying to find
that happy balance.

15:08.475 --> 15:12.279
[Rannells] "I'm gonna call
home tonight and say hello
to my mom and dad.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.647
I miss my family so much.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.317
They're so important to me.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.686
I wish that I could see them
more often."

15:22.289 --> 15:23.623
That spring, Matthew
announced that he was going

15:23.656 --> 15:25.425
to move to Laramie, Wyoming,

15:25.458 --> 15:27.394
and in May he made that move.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.698
He enrolled
at the University of Wyoming,

15:31.731 --> 15:34.067
which is where his parents
had gone to school.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.771
Mathew was pretty happy
in Laramie.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.574
Within the red state,
this college town

15:41.608 --> 15:44.544
was sort of a liberal enclave,
so while he was there,

15:44.577 --> 15:46.579
he met like-minded people,

15:46.613 --> 15:47.747
he was connecting
with friends,

15:47.780 --> 15:50.183
and that's also where he met
Jim Osborn.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.519
I'd see him almost
every single day

15:52.552 --> 15:54.621
in front of the Union,
and there he was,

15:54.654 --> 15:56.656
usually people-watching,

15:56.689 --> 15:59.292
always with his hair just so

15:59.326 --> 16:01.828
and polished look about him,

16:01.861 --> 16:03.896
you know,
just always making sure

16:03.930 --> 16:07.500
that anyone he talked to,
he was very focused on them

16:07.534 --> 16:10.503
and was very present
in that conversation.

16:11.904 --> 16:14.074
He always seemed
to be very confident

16:14.107 --> 16:17.244
and was definitely
outgoing and personable.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.413
I never doubted
"This kid is gonna make
a difference."

16:23.050 --> 16:26.053
[tense music playing]

16:30.423 --> 16:32.059
[Osborn] So, Tuesday night,

16:32.059 --> 16:35.895
Matt came
to the LGBTA Meeting.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.131
We'd been kinda
putting the final plans

16:38.165 --> 16:41.368
on all of the events
for Gay Awareness Week.

16:41.401 --> 16:45.272
And then, as we did
most weeks after the meeting,

16:45.305 --> 16:47.474
we all agreed,
let's go out for,

16:47.507 --> 16:50.210
you know, dinner
and something to drink after.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.345
And so we did that.

16:52.379 --> 16:55.682
And after we'd been there
for a while at Village Inn,

16:55.715 --> 16:58.451
he said,
"Okay. Well, I'm,
I'm not heading home yet."

16:58.485 --> 17:00.520
And we later learned
that he ended up

17:00.553 --> 17:01.454
at the Fireside.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.662
[Marcus] I can only imagine
that Matthew felt

17:09.695 --> 17:13.165
perfectly safe walking
into the Fireside Lounge.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.102
It's a place
he'd been before.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.103
He knew the bartender.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.605
He had no reason to be
looking over his shoulder

17:18.637 --> 17:20.873
and thinking someone
was gonna do him harm.

17:21.941 --> 17:24.977
[Osborn] The Fireside
was not a gay bar,

17:25.011 --> 17:27.680
but certainly a bar
where gay people

17:27.714 --> 17:29.682
did go from time to time

17:29.716 --> 17:32.252
because we didn't have
a designated gay bar

17:32.285 --> 17:33.320
in the state.

17:34.654 --> 17:38.325
Most of us had a bar or two
that we could go out to

17:38.358 --> 17:40.960
and feel relatively safe.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.462
I had been to the Fireside.

17:42.495 --> 17:45.165
It was nothing special.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.474
Matt says
he saw Matthew Shepard

18:27.507 --> 18:28.841
leave the bar with two men.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.479
Although he didn't see
their faces on the way out,

18:32.512 --> 18:34.581
he's confident
that those two men

18:34.614 --> 18:37.784
were the same who were paying
with coins for their pitchers,

18:37.817 --> 18:39.952
because he didn't see
those guys around after that.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.982
[distant dog barking]

19:11.284 --> 19:14.521
[object hissing]

19:16.323 --> 19:17.690
[Marks] Shortly
after midnight

19:17.724 --> 19:19.359
in a neighborhood
just north of town,

19:19.392 --> 19:22.362
a resident wakes up
and hears a hissing sound.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.798
So he goes outside
to investigate.

19:25.832 --> 19:29.236
What he finds is that
his tire has been slashed.

19:29.236 --> 19:32.239
[police radio
chattering indistinctly]

19:35.475 --> 19:38.411
He calls the police.
That's around 12:40 a.m.,

19:38.445 --> 19:41.147
and lets them know he thinks
someone has slashed his tire.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.400
At that time, the officer
was about four blocks

20:00.433 --> 20:02.702
from the house where the tires
were slashed,

20:02.735 --> 20:06.172
he sees two guys behaving
kinda strangely

20:06.205 --> 20:08.841
in this black Ford
pickup truck.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.615
And they're sitting there
and they aren't moving.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.149
[Marks] It's well
past midnight,

20:17.183 --> 20:19.719
there aren't many
people out and about.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.721
He's out looking for people

20:21.754 --> 20:23.122
who just slashed
somebody's tire.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.327
[Beck] And so he shines
a light on them,

20:27.360 --> 20:29.629
announces it's police.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.197
He thought they could have
been the suspects

20:31.230 --> 20:32.865
in the tire slashing.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.428
[Beck] Russell Henderson
was somebody

21:01.461 --> 21:02.662
who came from a family

21:02.695 --> 21:04.931
that had been
in Laramie a long time.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.534
By all accounts,
was a pretty good kid

21:07.567 --> 21:09.035
up until late teens.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.638
He was an Eagle Scout.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.406
He was raised
by his grandmother.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.975
His mother had some issues.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.510
[Marks] While he was living
with his grandmother,

21:17.544 --> 21:19.612
he was dating a University
of Wyoming student

21:19.646 --> 21:21.648
named Chastity Paisley.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.917
[Beck] And there's blood
on him.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.520
So the officer
asks Henderson,

21:27.554 --> 21:29.589
what happened to your left?

21:29.622 --> 21:33.360
He tells the officer
a pretty confusing story.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.696
Russell says that they got
jumped by two men

21:36.729 --> 21:39.966
who he describes
as a White guy
and a Hispanic guy,

21:39.999 --> 21:43.169
and that they'd been beaten
up pretty badly by them.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.072
Russell said
that the other two guys,

21:46.105 --> 21:48.841
the White guy
and the Hispanic guy
had run off.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.811
So, he's asked,
"Okay, well who were you with?

21:51.844 --> 21:54.947
Because we think
you're involved in some
of this vandalism

21:54.981 --> 21:57.517
that we've heard about
in the area."

21:57.550 --> 22:00.387
It seems Russell
is telling the police officer

22:00.420 --> 22:03.856
that he was not involved
in the tire slashing.

22:05.291 --> 22:08.528
He won't name anyone's names,
including the guy

22:08.561 --> 22:10.597
who the officer
just saw run away.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.733
Russell was hesitating
to tell the officer

22:13.766 --> 22:16.068
who the truck belonged to.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.971
And finally he says, "Well,
I was with Aaron McKinney."

22:19.839 --> 22:23.943
Aaron McKinney
was a young man

22:23.976 --> 22:26.746
who had grown up in Laramie.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.048
His parents were divorced.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.684
Anderson met Aaron McKinney
at some point

22:31.718 --> 22:33.753
and they were roofers
together.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.423
Aaron McKinney
was dating someone
named Kristen Price,

22:36.423 --> 22:39.426
and the two of them had
recently had a baby together.

22:39.426 --> 22:42.762
Aaron's mother had died
a few years earlier,

22:42.795 --> 22:45.131
actually from complications
from a hysterectomy.

22:45.164 --> 22:49.902
And that actually
led to him inheriting
quite a bit of money

22:49.936 --> 22:51.704
due to a life
insurance policy,

22:51.738 --> 22:53.806
and unfortunately,

22:53.840 --> 22:56.476
he used a lot of that money
on drugs

22:56.509 --> 22:58.778
and poor behavior.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.516
[Marcus] In the early '90s,
crystal meth

23:03.550 --> 23:05.785
arrived in Wyoming
in a big way.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.787
For someone like
Aaron McKinney,

23:07.820 --> 23:10.890
who thought of himself
as a bad boy to start with

23:10.923 --> 23:12.759
and had money in his pocket
to burn,

23:12.792 --> 23:14.494
it's not so surprising
that he wound up

23:14.527 --> 23:17.797
becoming one
of the army of people

23:17.830 --> 23:19.599
who became addicted to meth.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.772
[Beck] So the officer
continues talking

23:25.805 --> 23:28.475
to Russell Henderson
and he says,

23:28.475 --> 23:30.777
Aaron McKinney got cracked

23:30.810 --> 23:33.613
with a stick or something
when they got jumped.

23:33.646 --> 23:36.048
And Russell Henderson,

23:36.082 --> 23:37.484
he's got a gash in his lip

23:37.517 --> 23:39.285
and there's blood on him.

23:39.318 --> 23:41.287
So, the officer
also broadcasts out

23:41.320 --> 23:43.490
the descriptions
of the men who Russell

23:43.523 --> 23:45.057
told him about, this white guy

23:45.091 --> 23:47.126
and Hispanic guy
who supposedly jumped them.

23:48.327 --> 23:50.497
Right now everyone thinks
that those two men

23:50.497 --> 23:53.332
could be responsible not
just for vandalizing the tire,

23:53.365 --> 23:55.635
but also for attacking
Russell and Aaron,

23:55.668 --> 23:57.837
both of whom
were pretty badly injured.

23:57.870 --> 24:01.007
And so after they finished
their conversation,

24:01.040 --> 24:02.909
Henderson goes
in an ambulance

24:02.942 --> 24:05.678
to Ivinson Memorial Hospital.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.950
The officer takes a look
at the truck...

24:12.519 --> 24:17.089
and he sees a lot of things
outside of the truck
that looked odd.

24:22.194 --> 24:26.365
[Beck] There's this
really bloody gun.

24:26.398 --> 24:29.268
What is all this stuff?
What has happened here?

24:29.301 --> 24:33.139
And they're just
absolutely baffled
by what took place here.

24:33.172 --> 24:36.543
Initially, they think
it's just this one fight

24:36.576 --> 24:38.978
in a residential area,

24:39.011 --> 24:41.814
but there's more to this
and they know it.

24:53.459 --> 24:56.563
So they're processing
outside of the truck,

24:56.596 --> 24:58.798
they're swabbing blood.

24:58.831 --> 25:02.101
And of course, this gun
in the bed of the truck
is available to them,

25:02.134 --> 25:03.435
so they take it,

25:03.469 --> 25:05.104
and it's just covered
with blood.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.277
[Marks] Under federal law,
there is an exception

25:11.310 --> 25:13.445
to the rule that you need
a search warrant,

25:13.479 --> 25:15.782
which is called
the plain view doctrine.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.050
If an officer sees
a potential piece of evidence

25:18.084 --> 25:20.787
in plain sight,
they're allowed
to take that evidence,

25:20.820 --> 25:21.921
preserve that evidence,

25:21.954 --> 25:24.056
in the event that a crime
has been committed.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.627
[Beck] And then,
they look in the cab

25:27.660 --> 25:29.962
and they see this really
nice pair of shoes,

25:29.996 --> 25:30.963
which seem out of place,

25:30.997 --> 25:32.999
because they don't seem
like the kind

25:33.032 --> 25:35.067
that these guys would have.

25:53.519 --> 25:55.154
[tense music playing]

25:57.957 --> 26:00.526
[Beck] So, what's interesting
is you have

26:00.627 --> 26:03.062
some Laramie
Police Department people

26:03.095 --> 26:06.532
listening in
to the radio call.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.635
When Deputy Fluty,
the Albany County

26:08.635 --> 26:11.537
Sheriff's Deputy calls
from the fence and said,

26:11.638 --> 26:12.805
"We've got the student ID

26:12.839 --> 26:15.808
with the name
of Matthew Shepard,"

26:17.043 --> 26:19.679
the ears of some
police detectives perk up.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.428
[Beck] Right around this time,

26:36.462 --> 26:39.398
police are still
looking for Aaron McKinney.

26:39.431 --> 26:43.169
They go to his house...
He's not there.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.504
Eventually, Kristen Price,

26:45.537 --> 26:47.807
who was Aaron McKinney's
girlfriend,

26:47.840 --> 26:50.810
called police and said Aaron
was badly beaten up,

26:50.843 --> 26:54.346
and so now
he's at the hospital.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.548
[Marks] Aaron was injured
pretty badly from the assault

26:56.582 --> 26:57.817
the night before
between the White guy

26:57.850 --> 26:59.686
and the Hispanic guy,

26:59.686 --> 27:01.821
and he had to be transferred
from the local hospital

27:01.854 --> 27:04.791
to Poudre Valley to have
his head injury treated.

27:04.824 --> 27:06.793
[Beck] Police were
invited by Kristen Price

27:06.826 --> 27:08.194
to come and interview him.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.162
They do talk to him briefly

27:10.196 --> 27:13.599
a little bit and asked him
about the incident.

27:13.700 --> 27:16.803
So, they started asking
McKinney about the truck

27:16.836 --> 27:20.039
and he said, "Oh, well,
that was stolen from us

27:20.072 --> 27:23.042
when we were out last night."

27:23.075 --> 27:25.712
And he said he had been jumped
by a couple of folks

27:25.712 --> 27:26.946
and he got cracked
in the head.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.483
[Marks] While officers are
interviewing Aaron McKinney

27:31.517 --> 27:33.820
at the hospital,
they received word

27:33.853 --> 27:36.588
that Matthew has been found
on the outskirts of town

27:36.622 --> 27:39.058
and is being brought
into that same hospital.

27:40.727 --> 27:44.463
When the doctors there
see him,

27:44.496 --> 27:46.933
they are doing what they can
to try and revive him.

28:14.593 --> 28:16.428
The hospital contacted
his parents,

28:16.462 --> 28:17.964
who were still
in Saudi Arabia.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.766
They started
the process of getting home

28:19.766 --> 28:20.900
as quickly as they could.

28:22.769 --> 28:23.770
[Beck] They realized
right away,

28:23.803 --> 28:26.005
"We can't take care
of him here."

28:26.038 --> 28:27.874
So there's a hospital
in Fort Collins

28:27.907 --> 28:29.341
called Poudre Valley Hospital

28:29.375 --> 28:31.277
that handles head injuries.

28:31.310 --> 28:32.278
So, they realized right away,

28:32.311 --> 28:35.281
"We gotta get him
to that hospital."

28:35.314 --> 28:38.584
[siren wailing]

28:38.617 --> 28:41.587
[tense music playing]

28:44.290 --> 28:46.859
[Osborn] The first time
I learned about
what had happened to Matt,

28:46.893 --> 28:49.528
I got an email from
a mutual friend of ours,

28:49.561 --> 28:51.263
the same friend
that had introduced us.

28:51.297 --> 28:54.266
And she let me know
that Matt had been attacked

28:54.300 --> 28:56.235
and that he was
in the hospital.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.437
She let me know
that his prognosis

28:58.470 --> 29:00.206
was not good.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.875
[Patterson]
There was a shock,
there was a fear.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.845
There was just this distraught
feeling you had

29:05.878 --> 29:07.513
because you knew there
was nothing you could do.

29:07.546 --> 29:10.549
And so I just
kind of waited it out.

29:11.984 --> 29:15.021
[Osborn] The first few hours
were honestly pretty scary

29:15.054 --> 29:17.456
for myself and most of
the members of the group,

29:17.489 --> 29:20.292
because we didn't know
who had done this.

29:22.728 --> 29:24.196
For me, it was unmistakable

29:24.230 --> 29:26.065
that this had to be
about hate.

29:33.539 --> 29:37.176
[Beck] So, law enforcement
now starts to interview
people of interest

29:37.209 --> 29:38.845
about Matthew's attack.

29:38.845 --> 29:41.047
Police bring Russell,

29:41.080 --> 29:44.483
Chastity Paisley,
who was Russell's girlfriend,

29:44.516 --> 29:48.020
and Kristen into the station

29:48.054 --> 29:50.689
and try
and do interviews with them.

29:52.224 --> 29:55.327
Russell Henderson
isn't speaking, so he's...

29:55.361 --> 29:57.296
"Lawyering up"
is the term they use,

29:57.329 --> 29:59.398
he's gonna wait
for an attorney.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.667
Chastity Paisley
explains that,

30:01.700 --> 30:04.436
"Oh, well, I really
don't know anything."

30:04.470 --> 30:07.874
Kristen Price
had a little one at that time

30:07.907 --> 30:10.877
and she had no interest
in getting arrested

30:10.910 --> 30:13.112
or having anything happen
to her.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.402
And he told her,

30:36.435 --> 30:38.905
"I think
I killed somebody tonight."

30:43.242 --> 30:46.178
He explained
that he and Russell Henderson

30:46.212 --> 30:48.514
were at the Fireside bar

30:48.547 --> 30:51.150
where they saw somebody
that was gay

30:51.183 --> 30:52.885
and he looked like
he had money.

30:52.919 --> 30:54.286
Kristen tells him,

30:54.320 --> 30:56.923
they came up with a plan
that they would pretend

30:56.956 --> 30:59.025
that they're gay
and they'll try

30:59.058 --> 31:00.759
and get him to go with them

31:00.792 --> 31:02.094
and that they will rob him.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.731
And eventually,
he decided to go with them

31:05.764 --> 31:07.566
and they left
the Fireside bar.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.136
[Marks] After Aaron
tells her what happened,

31:10.169 --> 31:13.372
he goes into the bathroom
to get cleaned up.

31:13.405 --> 31:16.242
She looks in and sees him
washing off a bloody wallet.

31:16.275 --> 31:19.111
Aaron then took that wallet,
put it in a dirty diaper

31:19.145 --> 31:20.179
and threw it in the trash.

31:21.413 --> 31:24.750
[Beck] Kristen says
that Chastity and Russell

31:24.783 --> 31:28.287
come over and they discussed
the evening's events,

31:28.320 --> 31:30.389
realized they better get rid
of some of their evidence,

31:30.422 --> 31:31.958
better get rid
of their clothes.

31:51.877 --> 31:53.980
[Beck] The clothing
they did not get rid of

31:54.013 --> 31:55.081
was Russell's shoes,

31:55.114 --> 31:56.615
which were very expensive

31:56.648 --> 31:58.384
and he had just bought them,

31:58.417 --> 32:02.254
and they hid those in
a shed at another location.

32:04.490 --> 32:07.193
Law enforcement
goes to the location

32:07.226 --> 32:09.095
and after
a little bit of a search,

32:09.128 --> 32:12.864
they find the shoes
that were covered with blood.

32:12.898 --> 32:15.001
They go to
the McKinney household

32:15.001 --> 32:17.469
where they find his clothes,

32:17.503 --> 32:22.608
they're bloody,
and then in the dirty diaper
they find the wallet

32:22.641 --> 32:24.010
that's got
the driver's license

32:24.010 --> 32:26.378
of Matthew Shepard in it.

32:27.313 --> 32:29.715
By the end of the afternoon,

32:29.748 --> 32:30.849
all three were arrested

32:30.882 --> 32:33.485
in connection with what
happened to Matthew Shepard.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.225
At the time,
I was the news director

32:39.258 --> 32:41.093
at Wyoming Public Radio.

32:41.127 --> 32:42.928
I was also teaching
that semester

32:43.029 --> 32:45.431
at the University of Wyoming.

32:45.464 --> 32:49.135
I had a student
that was in my class

32:49.168 --> 32:52.171
and he called me up
that morning

32:52.204 --> 32:56.642
and told me that he wasn't
gonna be able to come
to class that day

32:56.675 --> 32:59.445
because something bad
had happened
to a friend of his.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.680
And I'm like,
"Are you kidding me?"

33:01.713 --> 33:02.781
Like what happened?

33:02.814 --> 33:04.083
He goes, "Oh, you're gonna
hear about this.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.551
This is a real terrible thing.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.253
It's going to be
a news story for you."

33:07.286 --> 33:08.587
[reporter 1]
Matthew Shepard...

33:08.620 --> 33:09.521
[reporter 2]
Matthew Shepard...

33:09.555 --> 33:10.556
[reporter 3]
Matthew Shepard...

33:10.589 --> 33:11.523
[reporter 4]
Matthew Shepard...

33:31.110 --> 33:32.411
[Beck] You know,
in public radio,

33:32.444 --> 33:36.248
we don't have the scanner
on like TV stations do

33:36.282 --> 33:37.749
or newspapers might.

33:37.783 --> 33:40.719
We don't do a lot of
that day-to-day crime stuff.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.089
But I did have somebody
that morning tell me,

33:43.122 --> 33:45.624
"Wow, the scanner
was really going last night."

33:45.657 --> 33:46.892
There was something going on.

33:46.925 --> 33:49.228
There's something
that happened
just outside of town.

33:50.096 --> 33:52.398
So, I called
the sheriff's office

33:52.431 --> 33:54.666
and they wouldn't say
anything, but they said,

33:54.700 --> 33:56.768
"We're gonna have
a news conference at 3:00."

33:59.571 --> 34:00.872
That afternoon,
we were there.

34:00.906 --> 34:02.974
Of course,
there may have been

34:03.008 --> 34:04.710
one other radio station there,

34:04.743 --> 34:07.213
and then I remember that some
local TV stations

34:07.246 --> 34:09.447
and some television stations
from Denver were there.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.885
[Marks] During
the press conference,
Sheriff Gary Puls

34:13.918 --> 34:17.223
remarked for the first time
about Matthew's attack.

34:17.255 --> 34:20.259
He also announced the charges
against Russell Henderson,

34:20.292 --> 34:23.129
Kristen Price
and Chastity Paisley.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.299
[Beck] Aaron McKinney had
not been charged as of yet,

34:27.333 --> 34:30.936
but they told us
that we know where he is

34:30.969 --> 34:33.371
and we are going to be
charging him shortly.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.242
The sheriff
made it very clear to us

34:36.275 --> 34:38.244
that he thought
that this incident happened

34:38.277 --> 34:40.246
because Matthew Shepard
was gay.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.368
In 1998,
the Wyoming legislature

35:02.401 --> 35:04.536
is mostly retired ranchers,

35:04.570 --> 35:06.305
you know, old White men.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.540
We didn't have
hate crime legislation.

35:08.574 --> 35:11.042
Passing any hate
crimes legislation

35:11.076 --> 35:13.979
would be like putting
a stamp of approval

35:14.012 --> 35:15.614
and saying "This is true,

35:15.647 --> 35:17.416
this is who we are."

35:17.449 --> 35:20.819
And it was just an obstacle
that they couldn't overcome.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.421
[Beck] From that point on,

35:22.454 --> 35:25.791
I never ever, ever,
ever heard a member
of law enforcement

35:25.824 --> 35:26.758
call it a hate crime.

35:27.826 --> 35:30.496
This was a local crime.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.798
It didn't strike me
that this was something

35:32.831 --> 35:35.301
the national news
would be interested in.

35:37.303 --> 35:41.240
[dramatic music playing]

35:41.273 --> 35:44.476
[Beck] Aaron McKinney
also had been transferred

35:44.510 --> 35:46.945
to Poudre Valley Hospital
in Colorado

35:46.978 --> 35:48.814
as well as Matthew Shepard.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.982
Police waited for him
to be released,

35:51.016 --> 35:52.551
and as soon
as he was released,

35:52.584 --> 35:55.287
he agreed to be extradited
back to Wyoming.

36:06.532 --> 36:09.268
[tense music playing]

36:33.058 --> 36:35.093
[Beck] Well,
he basically said,

36:35.126 --> 36:36.462
"Yeah, it happened and...

36:36.495 --> 36:38.430
But here's what happened."

36:38.464 --> 36:42.401
They're kinda driving around
and then they sort
of go to the Fireside.

36:43.269 --> 36:44.870
And they are really
short of cash.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.607
And they're using quarters,

36:48.640 --> 36:51.277
nickels and dimes
to buy a pitcher of beer,

36:51.277 --> 36:53.479
when they see this
other person approach them.

37:03.188 --> 37:06.792
[Beck] And they concoct
this plan where they're gay

37:06.825 --> 37:08.627
and they'll try
and get him
to go with them.

37:21.307 --> 37:23.074
[Marks] They leave the bar
and get in the truck,

37:23.108 --> 37:25.311
which is
Aaron's father's truck.

37:25.311 --> 37:28.213
Matthew is positioned
in between them in the seat,

37:28.314 --> 37:31.750
sandwiched
in between them, really,
and Russell's driving.

37:52.504 --> 37:55.574
[Beck] He was holding a gun
at that time,

37:55.607 --> 37:57.776
'cause they were,
you know, telling him
he was gonna be robbed,

37:57.809 --> 37:59.878
and then Aaron
took his wallet.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.114
[Marks] Aaron has his gun out.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.585
It just doesn't make sense
that Matthew

38:06.618 --> 38:09.888
would feel emboldened
to make a pass at him.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.362
Aaron McKinney just started
hitting him with a gun.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.031
He hit him in the face.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.434
He just whacked him.

38:26.438 --> 38:30.609
He explained
that Russell drove them
to the site,

38:31.877 --> 38:35.747
and then Russell tied him up.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.453
And then Aaron
just started to hit him...

38:42.621 --> 38:45.090
And hit him and hit him.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.227
[Marks] I'm sure
he was terrified.

38:51.229 --> 38:53.932
I imagine you would be
confused also,

38:53.965 --> 38:56.402
how could a scenario
of just leaving the bar

38:56.402 --> 38:59.137
with someone escalate
so quickly to this.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.654
[Beck] Really went
from a situation

39:15.687 --> 39:18.624
where it sounded like
what they were intending
to do was rob the young man,

39:18.657 --> 39:24.129
and just like that,
it turned into something
really catastrophic.

39:34.440 --> 39:38.343
Aaron basically
just unleashed on Matthew.

39:38.444 --> 39:41.112
He beat him brutally
and repeatedly.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.522
Aaron admitted he just
kinda went into a rage.

39:50.556 --> 39:53.892
He just started
hitting him and hitting him
and hitting him.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.327
And then Aaron took
his shoes.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.967
[Marks] Aaron tells
the police after he was done

40:02.000 --> 40:04.803
beating Matthew,
he assumed Matthew was dead.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.605
He and Russell jumped back
in the truck,

40:06.638 --> 40:08.440
drove back into town,

40:08.474 --> 40:10.008
potentially to get rid
of the gun,

40:10.041 --> 40:12.478
and got in a fight.

40:12.511 --> 40:15.547
There is something
of an ironic parallel

40:15.581 --> 40:17.315
in the fact that Aaron

40:17.348 --> 40:19.485
had just finished brutally
beating someone

40:19.518 --> 40:21.119
and came into town

40:21.152 --> 40:23.154
and then got his own head
cracked open.

40:25.791 --> 40:28.827
The thing in that interview
that comes across

40:28.860 --> 40:30.862
is he was actually
sort of nonchalant.

40:31.497 --> 40:32.330
[man speaking]

40:40.739 --> 40:43.241
[Beck] And after
the interview was done,

40:43.274 --> 40:47.145
he was charged with attempted
first degree murder,

40:47.178 --> 40:50.048
kidnapping,
and with aggravated robbery.

40:50.081 --> 40:52.851
[tense music playing]

41:55.413 --> 41:59.317
An openly gay
college student beaten
and left to die

41:59.350 --> 42:01.119
clings to life in Wyoming
this morning.

42:02.588 --> 42:05.123
[Marcus] I know that virtually
no one in Laramie

42:05.156 --> 42:08.326
or in the state of Wyoming
had any idea

42:08.359 --> 42:11.096
the media storm that was
about to descend on them,

42:11.129 --> 42:13.999
or what a chord
Matthew's story would strike

42:14.032 --> 42:16.101
at that particular
moment in history.

42:16.134 --> 42:17.468
[newscaster 1]
Matthew Shepard.

42:17.502 --> 42:18.670
[newscaster 2]
Matthew Shepard.

42:18.704 --> 42:19.705
[newscaster 3]
Matthew Shepard.

42:19.738 --> 42:21.506
[newscaster 4]
Matthew Shepard.

42:21.607 --> 42:23.775
[Marcus] In the hours
after Matthew was found,

42:23.809 --> 42:26.778
people learned
Matthew Shepard's name.

42:26.812 --> 42:30.081
He became a national
news story.

42:30.115 --> 42:32.784
[newscaster] It was a gruesome
discovery at this fence,

42:32.818 --> 42:35.086
a gay man barely
alive tonight

42:35.120 --> 42:37.455
in a coma, brain damaged.

42:37.488 --> 42:39.157
[Rannells] It was everywhere.

42:39.190 --> 42:41.693
It was in every newspaper.
It was on the news.

42:41.727 --> 42:44.730
Everyone's kind of like
just watching and listening

42:44.763 --> 42:47.198
and hoping that he would live.

42:47.232 --> 42:50.001
Not in my wildest dreams
would I expect

42:50.035 --> 42:52.470
that the New York Times
and Newsweek,

42:52.503 --> 42:55.306
and CBS, ABC, NBC,

42:55.340 --> 42:57.843
CNN, all those people
would be showing up

42:57.876 --> 43:01.747
in my community
within roughly 24 hours.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.815
I'd never seen that before.

43:03.849 --> 43:05.450
[Marcus] A couple of things
were going on

43:05.483 --> 43:08.920
in the hours
after Matthew was found.

43:08.954 --> 43:13.258
There were many people
who wanted Matthew's
story known,

43:13.291 --> 43:16.027
because these murders
had been going on
for a long time.

43:17.095 --> 43:20.231
Matthew's friends
and activists
were reaching out

43:20.265 --> 43:23.434
to an existing infrastructure
of gay rights,

43:23.468 --> 43:25.103
national organizations

43:25.136 --> 43:27.505
that then could amplify
what happened.

43:27.538 --> 43:29.808
[Patterson] The National Gay
and Lesbian Organization

43:29.841 --> 43:33.344
descended into Laramie,
in particular,

43:33.378 --> 43:35.781
GLAD, the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance against Defamation.

43:35.814 --> 43:37.716
Like, they're literally
a media watchdog group.

43:37.749 --> 43:40.518
This is what they do.
All they do at that time

43:40.551 --> 43:43.855
was watch the media
and contact different
members of the media

43:43.889 --> 43:47.225
about the stories
and the reporting
that they're doing.

43:47.258 --> 43:51.596
The only way change
was gonna happen
was to also use the media

43:51.697 --> 43:54.599
to amplify the story
of what happened to Matthew.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.035
People aren't stupid.
They're sophisticated
about the media.

43:58.569 --> 44:01.306
[Osborn] People were calling
the Campus Activity Center

44:01.339 --> 44:02.841
and leaving messages for me,

44:02.874 --> 44:05.977
Good Morning America
and Dateline.

44:06.011 --> 44:09.614
The hate and violence
must stop.

44:09.715 --> 44:12.784
It was kind of a scary
and unique challenge

44:12.818 --> 44:16.054
all of a sudden to be asked
to be the spokesperson

44:16.087 --> 44:18.890
for all gay people in Wyoming

44:18.924 --> 44:20.959
is the way it felt
at the time.

44:34.239 --> 44:35.741
My name is Nate Mickelson.

44:35.774 --> 44:37.475
I grew up
in Kemmerer, Wyoming.

44:38.744 --> 44:40.345
It was pretty small,

44:40.378 --> 44:42.047
maybe about 3,000 people.

44:43.381 --> 44:46.584
You know, I thought
I was the only gay person,

44:46.617 --> 44:49.087
but I was part
of that community

44:49.120 --> 44:52.758
and people cared for me
no matter what was going on.

44:52.758 --> 44:55.761
I was at college.
And when I heard about
what happened to Matt,

44:55.794 --> 44:57.362
it really shocked me.

44:57.395 --> 45:00.298
You know, it wasn't a kind of
Wyoming that I remembered.

45:00.331 --> 45:03.401
You know, it let me know
that I wasn't as safe
as I thought I had been.

45:03.434 --> 45:05.003
And I wasn't as safe

45:05.036 --> 45:07.105
growing up as I thought
I had been.

45:10.041 --> 45:12.844
Welcome my buddy,
Ellen DeGeneres.

45:12.878 --> 45:14.179
[O'Donnell] I was on
my TV show.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.082
It was an incredibly
turbulent time

45:17.115 --> 45:18.583
in my life and world.

45:18.616 --> 45:20.886
I remember
the James Byrd situation,

45:20.919 --> 45:23.889
the same horror and hypocrisy

45:23.922 --> 45:26.792
and evil and systemic racism

45:26.825 --> 45:31.129
that allows a Black man
to be lynched

45:31.162 --> 45:34.565
and feeling something
has to be done,

45:34.599 --> 45:36.067
not knowing what to do.

45:36.101 --> 45:38.804
And then right
on the heels of that,

45:38.804 --> 45:42.440
Matthew Shepard
and feeling that same horror.

45:44.910 --> 45:46.845
I first heard
about Matthew Shepard

45:46.878 --> 45:49.214
in my dorm room in New York,

45:50.115 --> 45:52.450
and there weren't
a ton of details.

45:52.483 --> 45:56.354
Even though this happened
thousands of miles
from where we were,

45:56.387 --> 45:58.824
I think we all recognized

45:58.824 --> 46:01.559
pieces of ourselves
in this story.

46:05.396 --> 46:07.866
In '98, I was
in San Diego, California.

46:07.899 --> 46:08.967
I was in high school.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.936
You know,
I was still in the closet.

46:12.237 --> 46:15.473
And, you know,
hearing about this awful,

46:15.506 --> 46:18.910
brutal crime was terrifying.

46:20.678 --> 46:23.048
It made me fearful

46:23.081 --> 46:24.883
to step toward coming out.

46:24.916 --> 46:26.651
It made me more fearful

46:26.684 --> 46:29.855
to embrace who I was

46:29.888 --> 46:33.291
because it reminded me
how much hate
there is out there.

46:33.324 --> 46:35.126
I spent a lot of time
trying to convince

46:35.160 --> 46:36.862
my mother in Nebraska

46:36.862 --> 46:38.864
that everything is still
gonna be okay

46:38.864 --> 46:40.731
and that I could be safe

46:40.765 --> 46:43.534
and would be safe
when in reality,

46:43.568 --> 46:44.569
I knew...

46:46.037 --> 46:47.973
that that might not
always be the case.

46:49.174 --> 46:50.708
It was terrifying. It was...

46:50.741 --> 46:52.343
It was a terrifying
realization.

46:53.979 --> 46:55.446
[Marks] While all of this
is going on,

46:55.480 --> 46:56.948
Matthew is still
in the hospital.

46:56.982 --> 46:59.417
His parents are there
and they're just hoping

46:59.450 --> 47:00.285
that he's going to survive.

47:01.386 --> 47:03.221
We all watched what
was happening with Matthew

47:03.254 --> 47:05.056
in the hospital and those days

47:05.090 --> 47:06.557
while he was trying to survive

47:06.591 --> 47:08.726
and we knew
the likelihood of that.

47:08.759 --> 47:12.330
And yet everybody
hoped, right?

47:17.235 --> 47:20.205
[suspenseful music playing]

47:38.823 --> 47:41.126
[Beck] You know, people were
critical of the community.

47:41.159 --> 47:42.961
Well, you know,
the Wild West,

47:42.994 --> 47:44.930
you're probably pulling
gay people off the street

47:44.930 --> 47:46.697
left and right
and beating them,

47:46.731 --> 47:50.768
or this kind of thing probably
happens in Laramie
all the time.

47:52.403 --> 47:54.272
[Rannells] There was
a real generalization

47:54.305 --> 47:56.574
about where Matthew was from

47:56.607 --> 48:00.411
and that maybe
it wasn't surprising

48:00.445 --> 48:03.949
that a gay kid
would have this...

48:03.982 --> 48:06.317
horrible crime happen to him

48:06.351 --> 48:08.453
in a rural area like that.

48:08.486 --> 48:13.158
That everyone from Wyoming
was anti-LGBTQ,

48:13.191 --> 48:16.194
that we were all just a bunch

48:16.227 --> 48:19.664
of uneducated hicks who went
around engaging

48:19.697 --> 48:22.767
in gay bashing
or words to that effect.

48:22.800 --> 48:25.470
[Sara Burlingame]
I think Wyoming
will always struggle

48:25.503 --> 48:28.506
with outsiders'
perception of us,

48:28.539 --> 48:30.275
like, it was taught
in our schools.

48:30.308 --> 48:33.344
It was preached
from our pulpits,

48:33.378 --> 48:35.880
but it's not unique
to Wyoming.

48:38.984 --> 48:41.987
People love to tell you

48:41.987 --> 48:45.223
"It would never happen
in this great blue state
that I live in."

48:45.256 --> 48:46.557
And they're full of [bleep].

48:48.859 --> 48:51.829
[dramatic music playing]

48:56.201 --> 48:58.903
It was homecoming weekend
for the University of Wyoming.

48:59.004 --> 49:02.640
And so normally,
that's festive, right?

49:19.024 --> 49:22.260
[Beck] And they were wearing
yellow arm bands, you know,

49:22.293 --> 49:24.762
saying that hate
is not a Laramie value.

49:24.795 --> 49:27.032
And it was just comforting
to see that.

49:27.032 --> 49:29.767
[Osborn]
And that you could see
the same message

49:29.800 --> 49:33.438
on the marquee out in front
of the mom and pop hotels

49:33.471 --> 49:37.075
and Arby's national
chain restaurants

49:37.108 --> 49:39.577
were putting signs up
like that, too.

49:48.286 --> 49:51.322
I cannot begin to describe

49:51.356 --> 49:53.191
the difference that that made

49:53.224 --> 49:57.162
as a queer person
in this town,

49:57.195 --> 49:59.297
knowing that there really
were more people

49:59.330 --> 50:01.599
who had our back

50:02.533 --> 50:04.102
and had Matt's back.

50:06.271 --> 50:08.173
People were rooting for him.

50:08.206 --> 50:10.908
There were people who were
praying for him to live.

50:10.941 --> 50:14.579
Like, it became this,
"Can this underdog make it?"

50:20.918 --> 50:22.687
[suspenseful music playing]

50:27.525 --> 50:28.726
-Ready?
-[producer] Yup.

50:31.196 --> 50:32.630
At 12:00 midnight

50:32.663 --> 50:36.601
on October 12th, 1998,

50:36.634 --> 50:39.537
Matthew Shepard's blood
pressure began to drop.

50:40.905 --> 50:44.375
His condition continued
to deteriorate.

50:45.543 --> 50:48.579
And at 12:53 a.m.
this morning,

50:48.613 --> 50:49.780
Matthew Shepard died.

50:54.252 --> 50:57.255
Matthew's mother said to me,

50:57.288 --> 51:00.125
"Please tell everybody
who's listening to go home.

51:00.158 --> 51:01.759
Give your kids a hug.

51:07.198 --> 51:08.899
And don't let a day go by

51:08.933 --> 51:11.669
without telling them
that you love them."

51:14.705 --> 51:18.976
Even though it was something
that for me,

51:19.009 --> 51:22.813
I had had kind of known
was coming,

51:22.847 --> 51:25.283
it still was...

51:26.484 --> 51:28.686
that letdown, that...

51:29.954 --> 51:32.623
That air escaping
your lungs in a way

51:32.657 --> 51:34.292
that you can't control.

51:35.593 --> 51:36.727
That...

51:38.463 --> 51:40.365
That last vain hope

51:40.398 --> 51:43.801
that well, gosh,
maybe he'll wake up was gone.

51:43.834 --> 51:46.804
[somber music playing]

51:48.239 --> 51:49.374
[Patterson] I broke.

51:49.407 --> 51:50.808
I literally broke.

51:50.841 --> 51:53.077
All of a sudden,
all of that grief

51:53.178 --> 51:56.847
and anger and sadness
just rushed in

51:56.881 --> 51:58.916
and completely overtook me.

52:02.287 --> 52:05.356
I was very devastated

52:05.390 --> 52:07.592
by Matthew's death

52:07.625 --> 52:10.795
and didn't quite know
what to do.

52:10.828 --> 52:14.632
My soul ate
at human's ability

52:14.665 --> 52:16.601
to be cruel to another.

52:21.306 --> 52:23.208
[Lambert] Hearing about
his death and processing it

52:23.208 --> 52:25.510
was even scarier
because there wasn't anybody

52:25.543 --> 52:27.678
for me to relate to about it.

52:27.712 --> 52:29.214
I didn't have anybody
to talk to about it.

52:29.247 --> 52:30.815
I just heard about it
and I thought...

52:30.848 --> 52:32.116
[exhales]

52:32.217 --> 52:34.919
"This is the world
that I'm about to enter

52:34.952 --> 52:37.522
as an adult."
And that scared me.

52:40.925 --> 52:43.127
My boyfriend has two kids

52:43.228 --> 52:45.996
and his daughter asked me
what I was doing today.

52:46.030 --> 52:48.999
And I explained that I was
going to do this documentary.

52:49.033 --> 52:51.702
And she asked me what it
was about and I said,

52:51.736 --> 52:55.640
"Well, it's about a boy named
Matthew Shepard who died."

52:57.908 --> 53:00.245
And she said,
"Why did he die?"

53:00.278 --> 53:02.613
And I said,
"Well, 'cause he was gay."

53:07.452 --> 53:11.856
And that was all I could think
to say about it

53:11.889 --> 53:13.258
to a 10-year-old.

53:16.160 --> 53:19.129
[dramatic music playing]

53:29.874 --> 53:31.942
[Marcus] After Matthew's death
was announced,

53:32.877 --> 53:34.979
there was such an outpouring

53:35.012 --> 53:37.615
across the country
with candlelight vigils

53:37.648 --> 53:40.451
in major cities
and small towns.

53:40.485 --> 53:43.921
I was astonished
by the outpouring of emotion.

53:44.989 --> 53:46.491
[Lambert] It broke
everybody's heart.

53:46.524 --> 53:50.027
And I think finally people
were starting to feel that,

53:50.060 --> 53:53.931
that no matter who you are,
no matter
what you identify as,

53:53.964 --> 53:55.866
no matter who you love,

53:55.900 --> 53:57.735
no one deserves
to be treated that way.

53:57.768 --> 53:59.670
[sirens wailing]

54:01.306 --> 54:03.741
[Mickelson] Matt's death
was a rallying point.

54:03.774 --> 54:05.410
People were angry,

54:05.443 --> 54:07.645
viscerally angry
about what was happening.

54:07.678 --> 54:11.449
Let us commit ourselves
to transforming the anger

54:11.482 --> 54:14.719
of this march
into sustained action.

54:14.752 --> 54:16.186
[protester]
Let's move tonight.

54:16.220 --> 54:18.122
Let's move
the country tonight.

54:18.155 --> 54:19.457
[protesters] Yeah.

54:19.490 --> 54:22.827
I am so... pissed off.

54:23.828 --> 54:25.496
[crowd clamoring]

54:27.932 --> 54:29.467
I can't stop crying.

54:30.935 --> 54:33.971
Here is an example.
This young kid
minding his own business

54:34.004 --> 54:36.807
gets murdered for no other
reason than he was gay.

54:36.841 --> 54:39.644
It was so sensational.
The story was so strong.

54:39.677 --> 54:41.912
And it was so clear
what had happened

54:41.946 --> 54:45.583
that you couldn't deny it
any further.

54:45.616 --> 54:48.853
[Barney Frank]
The determination we have

54:48.886 --> 54:50.688
will not diminish.

54:50.721 --> 54:53.791
[Dick Gephardt]
We still have a long way to go

54:53.824 --> 54:56.260
in our nation to make sure

54:56.361 --> 54:59.497
that hatred and intolerance

54:59.530 --> 55:02.066
are banished
from our country.

55:02.099 --> 55:04.502
[Marcus] It was astonishing.

55:05.570 --> 55:07.838
The only time I can recall
before that

55:07.872 --> 55:11.376
where there was that kind
of outpouring of emotion
and rage

55:11.409 --> 55:14.845
was when Harvey Milk
was assassinated in 1978.

55:14.879 --> 55:17.915
We must do more

55:17.948 --> 55:21.051
to deal with violent bigotry.

55:22.887 --> 55:24.755
Even though Matthew had died

55:24.789 --> 55:26.591
from an anti-gay hate crime,

55:26.624 --> 55:28.393
most of us were pretty naive

55:28.426 --> 55:30.428
about what anti-gay hate
looked like.

55:35.900 --> 55:38.403
-He's the one that said
he was a fag. I didn't.
-[man] Yeah.

55:38.436 --> 55:40.270
[Patterson] When we found out
that this guy,

55:40.304 --> 55:42.507
Fred Phelps,
from the Westboro
Baptist Church

55:42.540 --> 55:44.675
was coming to the funeral,

55:44.709 --> 55:47.244
it struck us as very odd.

55:47.277 --> 55:50.581
Like, why would someone come
protest at a funeral?

55:50.615 --> 55:52.717
I had never heard
of Fred Phelps before.

55:53.951 --> 55:56.521
Fred Phelps
coined the catchphrase,

55:56.554 --> 55:58.823
"God hates fags,"
and was just known

55:58.856 --> 56:02.126
for some really vulgar
and awful anti-gay rhetoric.

56:02.159 --> 56:03.861
[chattering indistinctly]

56:03.894 --> 56:06.497
[Rannells] It was just like
how much more horrific

56:06.531 --> 56:08.933
could a group
of people become?

56:08.966 --> 56:10.435
This seems like the right time

56:10.435 --> 56:14.138
to target this family,

56:14.171 --> 56:16.441
ruining this event
that should've been

56:16.474 --> 56:20.545
a very somber,
very respectful day.

56:20.578 --> 56:22.079
It's really shocking.

56:22.112 --> 56:23.881
Have you ever been
to a fag parade?

56:23.914 --> 56:25.149
[Fred] We didn't force
a fag...

56:25.182 --> 56:27.452
[Patterson] Him and his family
are holding up these signs

56:27.452 --> 56:29.053
like "Matt in hell"

56:29.086 --> 56:30.888
and "AIDS kills fags"

56:30.921 --> 56:33.223
and just like horrible,
hateful crap, right?

56:33.257 --> 56:34.792
You'll go to hell.

56:34.825 --> 56:36.260
You'll go to hell
just like Matthew Shepard

56:36.293 --> 56:37.895
for the hell he did
before he died.

56:37.928 --> 56:41.666
[Osborn] Romaine and I
knew that we had to
respond to that.

56:41.699 --> 56:44.134
We knew that it was probable
that Phelps

56:44.168 --> 56:47.337
and his group would
come back at some point.

56:47.371 --> 56:49.139
We felt that it was
important for us

56:49.173 --> 56:50.541
to send a message

56:50.575 --> 56:52.242
that we don't agree with that.

56:52.276 --> 56:54.712
That sort of thing
is not welcome here.

56:54.745 --> 56:57.147
We knew
we had to block them out.

56:57.181 --> 56:59.484
We wanted to
block out Fred Phelps
and all their horrible signs

56:59.517 --> 57:01.218
so that Judy and Dennis
would never have

57:01.251 --> 57:02.186
to look at their ugly faces.

57:04.021 --> 57:04.855
I had a plan.

57:11.662 --> 57:13.531
[suspenseful music playing]

57:16.534 --> 57:18.803
[Patterson] In the
in-between period

57:18.836 --> 57:20.638
between Matthew's
memorial service

57:20.671 --> 57:22.540
and then what was supposed
to be a hearing,

57:22.573 --> 57:24.341
really, for Russell Henderson,

57:24.374 --> 57:26.577
the world was crazy.

57:26.611 --> 57:29.079
Those of us who were actively

57:29.113 --> 57:30.681
still doing interviews,

57:30.715 --> 57:32.883
we talked
to Matthew's parents

57:32.917 --> 57:35.219
and asked what
they wanted us to say

57:35.252 --> 57:37.522
because that was important.
You know, we wanted
to make sure

57:37.522 --> 57:40.558
we were doing right,
not only by Matthew,
but by Judy and Dennis.

57:40.591 --> 57:42.760
We never stopped.
It never stopped.

57:42.793 --> 57:45.095
There was definitely,
you know, significant work

57:45.129 --> 57:47.231
happening with law enforcement

57:47.264 --> 57:50.367
and the court case, you know,
the county attorney's office.

57:50.400 --> 57:53.070
[Beck] A lot of motions
clarified in that time

57:53.103 --> 57:55.540
that this was going
to be a death penalty case.

57:55.573 --> 57:57.708
They had to separate
the two cases,

57:57.742 --> 57:59.544
so they weren't gonna be
tried together.

58:00.878 --> 58:04.048
[dramatic music playing]

58:07.818 --> 58:12.156
[Patterson] About a week prior
to Russell Henderson's trial,

58:12.189 --> 58:14.191
Jim Osborn calls me
and he says,

58:14.224 --> 58:16.226
"Fred Phelps is coming
to Laramie for the trials."

58:16.260 --> 58:17.895
And I said, "Great."

58:17.928 --> 58:19.764
The issue
and turn the country over

58:19.797 --> 58:22.332
to these militant sodomites.

58:22.366 --> 58:24.869
[Patterson] The whole exterior
of the courthouse

58:24.902 --> 58:26.837
was surrounded
by media people.

58:26.871 --> 58:28.573
There had to have been
like ten or fifteen

58:28.606 --> 58:30.775
satellite trucks,
hundreds of reporters.

58:30.808 --> 58:32.943
It was madness.

58:32.977 --> 58:35.212
And they're all focused
in on Fred Phelps

58:35.245 --> 58:36.847
and his horrible
anti-gay crap.

58:36.881 --> 58:39.584
In any nation that agrees
that it's okay to be gay

58:39.584 --> 58:42.319
will go the way
of ancient Sodom.

58:42.352 --> 58:44.021
And then all of a sudden,
this band of angels

58:44.054 --> 58:45.355
comes walking down the street
and they're like,

58:45.389 --> 58:46.857
"What the hell is this?"

58:46.891 --> 58:48.593
And like the parting
of the Red Sea,

58:48.626 --> 58:49.459
they all make way.

58:51.962 --> 58:54.832
-[people chattering
indistinctly]
-[woman] Yes.

58:54.865 --> 58:56.734
[Patterson] And we
surround Fred Phelps,

58:56.767 --> 58:58.903
we turn our backs to him,
and now we're angels.

59:00.170 --> 59:02.607
[Osborn] We didn't wanna let
that kind of hatred

59:02.607 --> 59:05.910
and bigotry come into
our community unchallenged.

59:07.878 --> 59:09.614
[Patterson]
And it worked very well.

59:09.614 --> 59:10.848
Fred Phelps can no longer
talk to people.

59:10.881 --> 59:12.316
He can no longer
yell at people.

59:12.349 --> 59:13.618
So, they just started
singing hymnals.

59:13.618 --> 59:15.219
And now there's angels
with floaty wings,

59:15.252 --> 59:17.454
listening to, you know,
beautiful hymns

59:17.487 --> 59:21.458
and it was serene
and surreal and just wild.

59:25.896 --> 59:29.433
[Beck] Russell Henderson's
public defender,
Wyatt Skaggs,

59:29.466 --> 59:31.802
had a number
of death penalty cases

59:31.836 --> 59:34.639
and he really didn't want
anything to go to trial.

59:34.672 --> 59:37.207
And he saw the evidence.
He knew what they had.

59:37.241 --> 59:40.044
Really worked tirelessly,
since this case began

59:40.077 --> 59:42.379
with one goal in mind.

59:42.412 --> 59:44.248
And that was
to save Russell's life.

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:19.483
Judge Donnell just said
this was a horrific murder.

01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:21.318
When you look
at all the facts in the case,

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:23.420
there's just no way
he should be out in public.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:26.256
And he gave him, you know,
the consecutive sentences.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:27.792
And so he's in for life.

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:32.262
Chasity Pasley,
who was Russell's girlfriend,

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:36.801
got sentenced to about
a year and a half in prison.

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:38.903
Aaron McKinney's girlfriend,
Kristen Price,

01:00:38.936 --> 01:00:41.538
ended up not ever
serving any time,

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:44.742
other than her initial
arrest time that she had

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:47.077
and just kind of moved on
with her life.

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:57.454
With those three
out of the way,
it became the trial.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:00.624
Aaron McKinney, he was facing
the death penalty.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.459
And that was the main event

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.061
that everyone
had been waiting for.

01:01:20.745 --> 01:01:22.813
There was a couple of things
still at play

01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:25.382
that this was just
a robbery gone bad

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:28.853
and this had nothing to do
with hate crimes.

01:01:28.886 --> 01:01:32.089
But this was a hate crime,
no doubt about it.

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:36.160
But one of the things
that the defense did

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:38.562
is they used
the gay panic defense

01:01:38.595 --> 01:01:40.397
that none of
this would've happened

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.767
if Matthew Shepard
didn't reach at his groin

01:01:42.767 --> 01:01:46.436
and touch him there,
and that caused him to snap.

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:49.239
Gay panic defense
is meant to say

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:53.510
that someone's gay
or queer or trans identity

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:56.513
is reason enough to harm them,

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:59.616
that that is something violent
and threatening

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:02.820
and is legally permissible

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:04.789
to take violent action
towards them.

01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:07.657
[Marcus] It wasn't
the first time.

01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:10.527
There have been a number
of occasions in the past

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.798
and about 30% of the cases
where this defense was used,

01:02:13.798 --> 01:02:15.399
people got a reduced sentence.

01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:20.337
[suspenseful music playing]

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.373
[Beck] And one of the things
that the defense also did

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:25.709
is they used the fact
that Aaron McKinney

01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:29.814
was a victim
of sexual abuse as a child.

01:02:29.814 --> 01:02:32.016
They need to explain
that he's got some

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:34.584
very raw emotions about this,

01:02:34.618 --> 01:02:37.354
and if somebody is making
a move on him,

01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:39.389
that's gonna trigger
some things

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:42.993
and lead to this beating,
lead to this attack.

01:02:43.027 --> 01:02:44.862
[Marcus] There were plenty
of people who believed

01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:47.832
that Matthew Shepard
as a gay man

01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:49.333
got what he deserved.

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:52.269
I really do think
that the McKinney crowd

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:54.138
thought that that would work,

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:55.973
and I was bracing for it.

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:04.214
[suspenseful music playing]

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:07.251
Soon as the gay panic
defense came up,

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:08.685
the prosecutor objected.

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:10.287
Well, I think
that is a defense

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.957
that is atrocious,
that should not be used

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:16.593
in any situation,

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.362
in any court
in these United States.

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:20.898
It gives people the excuse

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:22.532
to hurt or to kill
another person.

01:03:49.626 --> 01:03:51.195
[news reporter]
The ruling comes as a relief

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:53.097
to those who support
Shepard's family

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:55.365
and those who support
gay issues.

01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:59.003
Even if Matthew made a pass
at Aaron McKinney,

01:03:59.036 --> 01:04:02.472
all he had to say was,
"No, thank you,"

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:05.809
which is what women have had
to say over and over again

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:07.644
because men make
unwanted passes.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.113
He didn't have
to beat him to death

01:04:09.146 --> 01:04:10.280
with the butt of a gun.

01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:11.916
It's a pathetic defense.

01:04:11.916 --> 01:04:13.650
[Burlingame]
The gay panic defense

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:16.020
is the perfect articulation

01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:19.723
of how profoundly
we blamed the victims

01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:23.227
of homophobic
and transphobic crime.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:29.666
[news reporter] Jury found
Aaron McKinney guilty

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:31.268
of two counts of murder

01:04:31.301 --> 01:04:33.971
plus aggravated robbery
and kidnapping.

01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:37.041
The verdicts came
after just 10 hours
of deliberation.

01:04:37.074 --> 01:04:40.577
And then we were
all gearing up for what
we expected to be

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:43.713
a pretty good
death penalty discussion.

01:04:43.747 --> 01:04:45.615
And then out of nowhere,
it was announced that

01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:47.484
that's not
what was gonna happen.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:49.987
[news reporter]
After being approached
by defense attorneys,

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.057
the Shepards recommended
McKinney be given life

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:56.860
rather than death in memory
of their son.

01:04:56.961 --> 01:04:58.963
In an emotional address
to the court,

01:04:58.963 --> 01:05:00.797
Dennis Shepard told McKinney,

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:03.600
"You robbed me
of something very precious.

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:06.636
Mr. McKinney, I give you life

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:09.974
in the memory
of one who no longer lives.

01:05:09.974 --> 01:05:11.976
May you have a long life

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:15.412
and may you thank Matthew
every day for it."

01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:20.384
I was so moved by his words
and his compassion

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.352
and his ability to forgive.

01:05:22.386 --> 01:05:25.589
And I thought, this is
the dawning of something new.

01:05:28.725 --> 01:05:32.362
[Marcus]
After Matthew's death,
there was so much organizing

01:05:32.396 --> 01:05:34.331
and so much forward momentum

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:39.003
and so many public demands
for legislation

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:41.271
for hate crimes.

01:05:42.406 --> 01:05:46.276
Very quickly, the President
took up this cause.

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:49.313
And I think that in part,
that's because the country

01:05:49.346 --> 01:05:51.648
was ready to have
the conversation.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.783
Hate crimes laws
had been proposed

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:57.087
in Congress multiple times
and failed multiple times.

01:05:57.121 --> 01:06:01.158
This was not something
that had never been
discussed before.

01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:03.860
The Hate Crimes Prevention Act
would be important

01:06:04.028 --> 01:06:06.930
substantively and symbolically

01:06:07.031 --> 01:06:10.300
to send a message to ourselves
and to the world

01:06:10.334 --> 01:06:13.170
that we are going
into the 21st century

01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:17.674
determined to preach
and to practice what is right.

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:20.210
It also wasn't surprising
to me that ultimately

01:06:20.244 --> 01:06:22.446
that legislation died
in committee

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:24.181
because they weren't so quick

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:25.949
to pick up the ball
and run with it.

01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:42.766
[Patterson] I think the
Matthew Shepard Foundation

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:46.370
is one of the really
important things

01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:48.205
to come out
of Matthew's death.

01:07:09.293 --> 01:07:11.528
There is no excuse
for what happened to Matthew

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:13.997
and something needs
to be done to curb

01:07:14.098 --> 01:07:17.101
this hatred that seems
to be permeating society.

01:07:17.101 --> 01:07:20.404
Which ultimately, becomes
this incredible mission

01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:24.108
of erasing hate
through legislation.

01:07:24.108 --> 01:07:25.275
[man] We're gonna go ahead
and get started.

01:07:31.448 --> 01:07:33.150
[news reporter]
Down this dirt road,

01:07:33.183 --> 01:07:35.352
Byrd was murdered
early Sunday morning.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:37.621
The killers left
a trail of blood

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:40.757
and the trail of evidence
as they drove along this road.

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:43.893
[O'Donnell] The combination
of the horrific racism

01:07:43.927 --> 01:07:46.930
of James Byrd's death
and the homophobia

01:07:46.963 --> 01:07:50.567
in Matthew's,
I think are forever linked.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.803
They're forever linked
emotionally and morally.

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:58.408
They're evils of the...
Of the same pile,

01:07:58.442 --> 01:08:02.412
you know, and that they're
linked together as we all,

01:08:02.446 --> 01:08:05.582
you know, move forward
for equality in this country.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:07.784
This is an issue
we couldn't let go by.

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.619
I have a window
of opportunity here

01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:11.155
that I wanna
take advantage of.

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:31.608
[Patterson] All of a sudden,

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.178
this tremendous responsibility
fell upon her.

01:08:34.178 --> 01:08:35.779
She doesn't like crowds,

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:37.546
she doesn't like being
in front of people,

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:39.383
and yet despite all of that,

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:43.187
she continued to do it
day after day.

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:46.055
[Patterson] When I think about

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:48.358
how she responded to it,

01:08:48.392 --> 01:08:50.560
if you don't have respect
for that woman,

01:08:50.594 --> 01:08:53.062
you don't even know
the meaning of the work.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:56.200
Today's hearing
is a very important one

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.736
and focuses on the serious
problem of hate crimes.

01:08:59.769 --> 01:09:02.971
Think of the incidence
of recent violent crimes

01:09:03.006 --> 01:09:05.209
that are motivated
by hate and bigotry

01:09:05.242 --> 01:09:08.077
and how they've seared
the conscience
of this country.

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:10.880
And so people were like,
"Let's talk about this.

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:14.082
Let's talk about it right now,
because if we don't,

01:09:14.117 --> 01:09:17.654
this is gonna continue
to happen and we cannot
afford that."

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:21.291
It took society, I think,
a while to understand

01:09:21.325 --> 01:09:24.961
what it is to protect
minorities in this country

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:28.398
who don't often have a voice
socially or politically,

01:09:28.432 --> 01:09:32.868
and who get demonized
and treated as less than.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:39.676
The fact that
this legislation exists

01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:42.246
highlights these crimes

01:09:42.246 --> 01:09:45.014
as something
other than just a murder.

01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:47.082
These are committed
specifically

01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:49.786
because the individual
committing the crime

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:51.621
hates that person

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:54.258
because of who they are,
fundamentally.

01:09:54.258 --> 01:09:57.026
We were just asking
to not be murdered.

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.363
It is the most modest
of requests.

01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:03.667
Hate crimes have no place
in America.

01:10:04.268 --> 01:10:06.670
[gavel banging]

01:10:08.305 --> 01:10:11.007
In 2007, a version
of the Matthew Shepard

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.877
Hate Crimes Act was
reintroduced to the Senate.

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:15.345
It passed the house...

01:10:15.379 --> 01:10:19.015
On this bill,
the yays are 237.

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.917
The nays are 180.

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.151
The bill is passed.

01:10:22.185 --> 01:10:24.421
[people cheering]

01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:27.924
It was attached to the Defense
Authorization Act.

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:30.059
President Bush
said he would veto

01:10:30.093 --> 01:10:32.161
the Defense
Authorization Act, however,

01:10:32.195 --> 01:10:35.031
if this Hate Crimes Act
was attached to it.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.466
So ultimately it was removed

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.167
from the Defense
Authorization Act

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:39.536
and it died on the floor.

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:44.107
[Burlingame] If you track
the trajectory

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:46.910
of the hate crimes
being introduced,

01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:48.378
there's something
really instructive

01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:50.747
about what
our movement, right?

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.182
Like advocating for the full

01:10:53.216 --> 01:10:55.952
dignity and health
of LGBTQ people,

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:58.355
what we learned
in the process,

01:10:58.388 --> 01:11:02.058
once we sort of coalesced
around like the love

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:06.330
is love message
that helped progress us.

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:20.877
And it haunts me to this day,

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:25.081
to think about how many times

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:28.151
she has bared her soul
and her pain

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:30.920
for the benefit of others.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:36.360
How many hearts
she has changed.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.895
How many minds
she has expanded.

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:47.904
Thank you so much and welcome
to the White House.

01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:57.381
You know, as a nation,
we've come far

01:11:57.381 --> 01:12:00.149
on the journey towards
a more perfect union,

01:12:00.183 --> 01:12:02.386
and today we've taken
another step forward.

01:12:02.386 --> 01:12:04.388
This afternoon
I signed into law

01:12:04.388 --> 01:12:06.956
the Matthew Shepard
and James Byrd Jr.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.394
-Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
-[applauding]

01:12:10.394 --> 01:12:12.429
[Marcus] It took 11 years
from Matthew's murder

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:15.131
to get hate crimes
legislation signed,

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:19.403
that seemed quick to me
for legislation

01:12:19.436 --> 01:12:22.939
covering something that's
as potentially controversial

01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:27.243
as protecting gay people
and others

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:29.479
from hate crimes.

01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:00.309
[all applauding]

01:13:01.945 --> 01:13:03.346
[Marcus] I was shocked

01:13:03.447 --> 01:13:05.449
and, uh... [chuckles]

01:13:08.952 --> 01:13:12.088
And moved to tears
then and again now.

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:14.724
There is something

01:13:14.758 --> 01:13:16.460
so important about knowing

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:20.797
that your government,
my government cares about me.

01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:24.501
[Lambert] What that started
to set up was awareness

01:13:24.534 --> 01:13:26.703
for equal rights legislation.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:29.272
And it started something.

01:13:29.305 --> 01:13:33.142
It started the country
taking this seriously

01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:36.546
and trying to protect us
as members of the country.

01:13:38.381 --> 01:13:40.183
[Marcus] What happened
to Matthew Shepard

01:13:40.216 --> 01:13:42.018
was a key turning point.

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:43.853
The legislation that was
passed ultimately

01:13:43.887 --> 01:13:46.022
because of his murder
is very important

01:13:46.055 --> 01:13:47.991
for our community.

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:50.960
I think a lot of us thought
that it was over,

01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:53.563
that we didn't have
to fight anymore,

01:13:53.597 --> 01:13:55.264
that we were accepted.

01:13:55.298 --> 01:13:59.235
We were so wrong
on so many levels.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:07.043
The years following
the signing of federal
hate crimes legislation

01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:09.245
felt like
an almost golden age.

01:14:11.314 --> 01:14:15.184
We were starting to feel like
we're actually gonna live

01:14:15.218 --> 01:14:17.153
in a country that welcomes us.

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:19.823
We were in a great place.

01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:22.058
There was not really
a worry or a concern

01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:24.360
when we woke up
in the morning about,
you know,

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:27.063
having to put on extra armor
or the shield, right?

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:29.533
I mean, we felt freer.

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:31.535
[Mickelson] It created
this feeling of momentum

01:14:31.535 --> 01:14:33.603
and this feeling of like,
we finally figured out

01:14:33.637 --> 01:14:35.805
as a country how to like,

01:14:35.839 --> 01:14:37.874
make people feel included

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:40.209
and to like
celebrate difference.

01:14:42.612 --> 01:14:45.815
[people cheering]

01:14:45.849 --> 01:14:47.717
This morning, I am proud

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:51.354
to sign a law
that will bring an end

01:14:51.387 --> 01:14:52.989
to Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:55.992
[cheering and applauding]

01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:04.133
And in 2015
when the Supreme Court

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.702
ruled on marriage equality,

01:15:05.735 --> 01:15:08.171
and then same-sex marriage

01:15:08.204 --> 01:15:10.039
was legal across the land.

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:15.378
[Brett] The ban
on gay adoption was,
you know, dropped.

01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:17.947
And so all of a sudden,
our whole family structure,

01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:21.117
which had been illegal
in this country

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:24.220
and in this state,
was now a thing of the past.

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:26.122
So we were legally married
in the state of Florida.

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:28.191
We could now legally
adopt children

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:30.426
in the state of Florida.

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:33.029
This wonderful glow of being,
you know, new dads.

01:15:33.062 --> 01:15:34.831
-I loved every minute of it.
-Yeah. It was...

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:37.300
It was amazing.

01:15:37.333 --> 01:15:39.202
Um, it was amazing.

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:42.105
It was a step
in the right direction.

01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:43.607
It was a step in acceptance.

01:15:45.074 --> 01:15:46.910
And I let my guard down
thinking that

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:48.712
things are only
gonna get better.

01:15:48.745 --> 01:15:50.479
And I've lived
long enough to see

01:15:50.513 --> 01:15:54.117
multiple... waves

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:57.186
of progress and backlash.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.155
Should have seen it coming,
and I didn't.

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:02.158
[cheering]

01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:06.462
[Brett] Election night,

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:10.199
the election night of 2016,

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:12.401
I am devastated
because I don't know

01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:14.303
what this means for my family.

01:16:14.337 --> 01:16:17.974
I remember people
that were supporting

01:16:18.007 --> 01:16:20.276
of the then president,

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:22.979
"Oh, they're not...
Nothing's gonna change."

01:16:23.012 --> 01:16:24.047
-Mmm-hmm.
-They're not gonna...

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.114
They're not gonna touch

01:16:25.148 --> 01:16:26.750
any LGBTQ rights.

01:16:26.783 --> 01:16:29.552
And I'm like, "You're naive."

01:16:29.653 --> 01:16:33.657
I, Donald John Trump,
do solemnly swear.

01:16:33.657 --> 01:16:37.426
I knew this was a potentially
very dark time ahead.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:39.362
The furies had been unleashed.

01:16:39.395 --> 01:16:41.831
[crowd] Trump! Trump! Trump!

01:16:41.865 --> 01:16:43.700
[Marcus] With a backlash

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:45.735
that I couldn't
have imagined.

01:16:45.769 --> 01:16:48.071
They are worthy of death.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:51.307
These people should be
put to death.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:54.343
[Cudmore] 2016 began with
the bathroom bill

01:16:54.377 --> 01:16:57.146
that was North Carolina's
legislation

01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:00.083
to prevent trans-students
from using the bathroom

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.951
that aligned
with their gender identity.

01:17:01.985 --> 01:17:04.253
My name is Erin Reed.
I use she/her pronouns.

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:06.255
I'm a queer legislative
researcher

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:08.091
and activist,
and a content creator.

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:10.426
Those of us who are active
in the LGBTQ community

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.461
and in LGBTQ rights

01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:15.398
had a lot of fear that
our rights would be curtailed.

01:17:15.431 --> 01:17:18.567
And those fears
came to fruition
relatively quickly.

01:17:22.706 --> 01:17:24.808
The purpose
of our school system

01:17:24.841 --> 01:17:27.410
is to educate kids,
not to indoctrinate our kids.

01:17:27.443 --> 01:17:28.878
[crowd] Correct!

01:17:28.912 --> 01:17:30.613
My name is Zander Moricz.

01:17:30.714 --> 01:17:32.415
I knew about Matthew Shepard,

01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:36.152
but I don't know
if that narrative is as widely

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:37.787
acknowledged as I would
like it to be

01:17:37.821 --> 01:17:40.023
because these stories
are essential

01:17:40.056 --> 01:17:42.425
to share and reflect on.

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:44.493
I was raised
in Sarasota, Florida,

01:17:44.527 --> 01:17:47.430
which is a pretty politically
polarized community,

01:17:47.463 --> 01:17:50.934
and I found sanctuary
in my school community.

01:17:52.769 --> 01:17:54.838
I came out to
a civics teacher
at Pine View,

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:56.572
who was then
my PE teacher actually.

01:17:56.605 --> 01:17:58.742
It was a safe space.
It was exactly

01:17:58.742 --> 01:17:59.876
what a school is meant to be.

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:01.644
It's a place to learn

01:18:01.745 --> 01:18:04.748
and discover not only things
in subjects but yourself.

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:07.751
That environment

01:18:07.784 --> 01:18:09.452
that is so accepting,
that is so affirming,

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:11.454
is a threat
to the politicians

01:18:11.487 --> 01:18:13.622
and they need a solution
for that.

01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:15.558
And the solution is,
"Okay, it's all happening

01:18:15.591 --> 01:18:17.660
in these safe spaces.
We'll take them away."

01:18:17.761 --> 01:18:20.029
And the Don't Say Gay law
was an example of that.

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:22.231
No sexual instruction

01:18:22.265 --> 01:18:24.968
in grades pre-K through three.

01:18:25.001 --> 01:18:26.836
And so how many parents

01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:29.806
want their kindergartners
to have transgenderism

01:18:29.839 --> 01:18:33.476
or something injected
into classroom instruction?

01:18:33.509 --> 01:18:35.544
When this was first
introduced as a bill,

01:18:35.578 --> 01:18:37.781
our boys were in first grade.

01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:40.516
The bill is supposed
to impact kids' kindergarten
through third grade.

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:43.119
So, this was bringing it home
directly for us.

01:18:43.152 --> 01:18:45.789
The Don't Say Gay bill
is now law.

01:18:45.822 --> 01:18:48.391
Governor Ron DeSantis Monday
signed the measure

01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:50.927
banning certain instruction
about sexual orientation

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:54.363
and gender identity
in the classroom.

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:56.800
One of the things that makes
this piece of legislation

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.868
so horrifying is the way
that it's enforced.

01:18:58.902 --> 01:19:01.104
The enforcement mechanism
is that any parent

01:19:01.137 --> 01:19:03.940
-can sue a school district.
-[activists chanting]

01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:06.910
[news reporter] Opposition
to the bill grew louder
in recent days.

01:19:06.943 --> 01:19:09.378
[Lambert] For a public school
teacher in Florida

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:12.348
to get in trouble
for having maybe a photo

01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:14.483
of their spouse on their desk.

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:17.453
We can't even take
a risk. Imagine what
the consequence would be.

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:20.824
What's going on?
We are like going
completely backwards.

01:19:20.824 --> 01:19:23.192
Although Ron DeSantis
said that it was intended

01:19:23.226 --> 01:19:26.896
to protect only the youngest
children from,

01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:30.033
you know, being indoctrinated
into homosexuality,

01:19:30.066 --> 01:19:33.736
the law's been expanded
to apply to kids

01:19:33.837 --> 01:19:36.439
in grades K through 12.

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:39.208
-The amount of silence...
-Mmm-hmm.

01:19:39.242 --> 01:19:41.044
...was deafening.

01:19:41.077 --> 01:19:43.179
We are still seeing
hateful attacks

01:19:43.212 --> 01:19:46.349
like the attack on Matthew
and what that signifies to us

01:19:46.382 --> 01:19:47.851
is not that there hasn't
been any progress,

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.418
but that that hate
still exists.

01:19:49.452 --> 01:19:51.988
And that's like
the enemy of equality.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.729
In Texas, the governor
had a directive

01:20:00.763 --> 01:20:03.967
to prevent trans-youth

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.570
from accessing transgender
affirming medical care.

01:20:07.603 --> 01:20:09.338
[news reporter] The governor's
directive was to investigate

01:20:09.372 --> 01:20:11.908
some Texas parents
of transgender children

01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:13.742
for potential child abuse,

01:20:13.776 --> 01:20:15.544
specifically parents
who provided gender

01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:17.680
affirming care
that stops puberty.

01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:20.183
[Burlingame]
Those bills do harm.

01:20:20.216 --> 01:20:23.052
They create bullying
for transgender youth.

01:20:23.086 --> 01:20:26.355
Transgender youth deserve
to be protected and safe.

01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:29.258
You don't hear
anything like that from
Governor Abbott, right?

01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:30.593
Like, you hear the reverse.

01:20:30.626 --> 01:20:32.929
You hear this dehumanization

01:20:32.962 --> 01:20:36.165
of kids from Governor Abbott.

01:20:36.199 --> 01:20:39.903
And somehow from 2016 to now

01:20:39.936 --> 01:20:41.504
that has become normalized.

01:20:41.537 --> 01:20:43.106
All this is going to do

01:20:43.139 --> 01:20:45.441
is force a lot of us
back into hiding.

01:20:46.509 --> 01:20:48.644
What can they do?
They can hide.

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:50.013
That's about
all there is left.

01:20:50.046 --> 01:20:51.847
Or they can fight.

01:20:51.881 --> 01:20:54.250
And neither one
of those options feels good,

01:20:55.218 --> 01:20:57.220
but that's what's left.

01:20:57.253 --> 01:20:59.989
I mean, hide or fight,
you know?

01:21:00.023 --> 01:21:02.525
Matthew Shepard's death
was horrific,

01:21:02.558 --> 01:21:05.328
but it's also this violence
is commonplace.

01:21:06.429 --> 01:21:08.331
We're so grateful
that you're with us here

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:12.168
as we cover a mass
casualty shooting

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:15.038
in downtown Orlando.

01:21:15.071 --> 01:21:17.840
[Cudmore] Physical violence
like the massacre

01:21:17.941 --> 01:21:21.244
at Pulse nightclub
in Florida,

01:21:21.277 --> 01:21:25.448
or the mass shooting at Club Q
in Colorado Springs,

01:21:25.481 --> 01:21:27.516
that teaches our queer youth

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:30.586
and queer people in general
to be terrified,

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:35.358
that based on
their identity alone
they can be slaughtered.

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:37.560
[Marcus] The sad fact
is that people
are always going to hate.

01:21:37.593 --> 01:21:39.362
And no matter what we do,

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:42.098
we keep coming back
to the same horrible places.

01:21:43.366 --> 01:21:45.468
But we can't not fight.

01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:47.236
We have to continue to fight.

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:49.973
And that means
being visible when you can

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:52.976
to your family,
to your friends,
to your community.

01:21:53.977 --> 01:21:56.445
[Burlingame] The people
who are part of that,

01:21:56.479 --> 01:21:59.548
you know, movable middle,
who are your neighbors,

01:21:59.582 --> 01:22:03.352
who just need to hear
a different message,

01:22:03.386 --> 01:22:05.554
invite them in,
have that conversation.

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:09.225
On the other side,
like conservative folks,

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:11.995
you're gonna have
to find your moral courage.

01:22:12.028 --> 01:22:14.463
Like history
is gonna look back

01:22:14.497 --> 01:22:18.001
on what you did
and did not do
during this time.

01:22:18.001 --> 01:22:21.037
And I think they're going
to judge you harshly

01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:24.540
for how rapidly
you capitulated your values.

01:22:30.113 --> 01:22:31.280
[activist chanting]

01:22:31.314 --> 01:22:33.482
Matthew's story
is really important

01:22:33.516 --> 01:22:36.152
because it was
one of the reasons why

01:22:36.185 --> 01:22:40.523
we were able to move forward
in the past 25 years.

01:22:40.556 --> 01:22:44.027
[Marcus] But the need
in this moment
when it's hard

01:22:44.027 --> 01:22:47.130
to get motivated to fight
all over again,

01:22:47.163 --> 01:22:49.498
to remember
who this young man was,

01:22:49.532 --> 01:22:52.801
who was so brutally murdered
because he was gay.

01:22:52.835 --> 01:22:54.570
-[man] Move!
-You're a bigot
and you're a coward!

01:22:56.339 --> 01:22:58.207
And that is
why Matthew's story

01:22:58.241 --> 01:22:59.842
continues to be told.

01:23:02.178 --> 01:23:06.282
And we do have to keep
sharing Matthew's story.

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:08.617
We have to teach gay history.

01:23:10.053 --> 01:23:11.954
It's very important

01:23:12.055 --> 01:23:14.157
that we continue
to focus on young people.

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:16.492
Young people are the future.

01:23:16.525 --> 01:23:20.763
We have a lot of brave
teens like Zander
doing the things he does,

01:23:20.796 --> 01:23:22.531
and it's encouraging.

01:23:22.565 --> 01:23:23.832
[Moricz] What happened
to Matthew Shepard

01:23:23.866 --> 01:23:26.502
is undeniably wicked

01:23:26.535 --> 01:23:28.704
and disgusting
and full of hate

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:30.706
that's happening again
every single day.

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.809
But there's nothing
stopping us

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.079
from revolutionizing
our society

01:23:36.079 --> 01:23:38.181
in a generation.
We absolutely could.

01:23:38.214 --> 01:23:39.982
We just have to
start right now.

01:23:40.083 --> 01:23:41.550
[activists] Now!

01:23:41.584 --> 01:23:44.487
[suspenseful music playing]

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.090
[activist chant continues]
