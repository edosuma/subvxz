WEBVTT

00:03.704 --> 00:06.974
[theme music]

00:08.276 --> 00:10.344
Hey, David, you still
looking for an apartment?

00:10.378 --> 00:12.646
And remember, if you
find one with a stove,

00:12.680 --> 00:14.548
you're going to have
to learn how to cook.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.584
Oh, that's not
necessarily true, Mark.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.287
As I recall, your trailer
has a reading lamp.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.160
All these apartments are
much, much too expensive.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.995
I'm going to have to find
a better job than busboy.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.731
[scoffs] This
is Lanford, David.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.933
Unless the pin setter at
the bowling alley dies,

00:32.966 --> 00:36.770
you've got the best job in town.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.107
Or you could get a trailer
like Becky's, and then

00:39.140 --> 00:41.675
just hook it up to your truck,
and haul it wherever the crops

00:41.709 --> 00:42.510
are ready for picking.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.848
Hey, don't start
with me, Darlene.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.983
Yeah, yeah, the
trailer stays parked.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.752
That's why it's
called a trailer park.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.292
Now, what's
wrong with Lanford?

00:58.326 --> 01:00.194
Well, for one thing,
Becky's neighborhood

01:00.228 --> 01:05.199
is leaking transmission
fluid into the water supply.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.135
Why get a job anyway?

01:07.168 --> 01:08.869
Why don't you have
Ms. Hotshot here

01:08.902 --> 01:11.639
set you up in a fancy
apartment in some great city?

01:11.672 --> 01:12.873
Huh?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.275
Where are you going to
after you graduate, Darlene?

01:14.308 --> 01:16.477
New York, Paris, London?

01:16.510 --> 01:19.280
Ooh-ooh, somebody's been
reading Hard Rock T-shirts.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.986
She's a little bit
bummed out about Darlene

01:26.019 --> 01:27.655
getting that big job offer.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.824
I think she feels
like she's in a rut.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.926
Sorry if I'm doing
OK while her life

01:32.960 --> 01:33.894
is a miserable failure.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.832
All right, all right,
I'll go downstairs

01:38.866 --> 01:42.836
and try and think of something
positive to say about her life.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.405
If you don't hear from
me till Christmas,

01:44.438 --> 01:47.408
buy or sell something nice.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.443
You gotta understand,
Mark, Becky was always

01:49.477 --> 01:52.112
the big achiever in the family.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.447
Yeah, but she's
got to understand

01:53.481 --> 01:54.748
that we've achieved a lot too.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.617
I mean, we've got our own
place now, we've got a car,

01:56.650 --> 01:59.820
we've got a CD player,
and I'm sure there's

01:59.853 --> 02:01.422
stuff I'm not even remembering.

02:08.396 --> 02:10.431
I just had a great idea.
- Really?

02:10.464 --> 02:11.299
You remember it?

02:14.034 --> 02:15.936
Why don't you guys come down
to the trailer for a party

02:15.969 --> 02:16.904
tomorrow?

02:16.937 --> 02:19.607
A whole bunch of
us all together?

02:19.640 --> 02:22.276
Wouldn't that attract coyotes?

02:22.310 --> 02:23.477
No, it'll be great.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.179
You can say how nice she's
fixed up the trailer.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.614
You can compliment her a lot.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.482
It's just what she needs.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.484
Hey, I'll buy some beers.

02:30.518 --> 02:34.688
Well, usually I don't drink
during the week unless--

02:34.722 --> 02:37.525
well, actually, there
are no restrictions.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.092
Come on, it'll be great.

02:39.126 --> 02:39.993
Believe me.

02:40.027 --> 02:40.894
This is just what she needs.

02:44.932 --> 02:45.799
Hey.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.035
Hey, wait a minute.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.903
I think I found something I
can afford with the money I'm

02:49.937 --> 02:51.539
making right now.
Listen to this.

02:51.572 --> 02:55.008
Basement apartment, fully
furnished, $125 a month.

02:55.042 --> 02:55.976
Wow.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.044
Let's see if there's
a phone number.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.323
Ms. Conner was
just seeing if there

03:09.357 --> 03:12.426
was any interest out there.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.428
Really, there's no rush, David.

03:14.462 --> 03:17.831
[theme music]

03:55.269 --> 03:57.671
[laughs]

04:05.746 --> 04:08.148
Is somebody coming over?

04:08.181 --> 04:09.116
What?

04:09.149 --> 04:10.518
No.
Tonight?

04:10.551 --> 04:11.685
No.

04:11.719 --> 04:12.853
I mean, you never know, right?

04:12.886 --> 04:14.054
But no.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.223
Uh.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.058
There are three bowls
of peanuts set out.

04:20.961 --> 04:21.895
Who's coming over, Mark?

04:21.929 --> 04:22.796
Nobody.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.765
God, don't be so suspicious.

04:24.798 --> 04:25.999
I mean, I'm not the
one on trial here.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.372
ROSEANNE: Surprise!

04:31.405 --> 04:32.406
Hey.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.507
You should see the
look on your face.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.612
Is the whole family coming?

04:38.646 --> 04:40.781
Yeah, and I invited some
people from the trailer park.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.150
Oh, so that's why they were
running that can of deodorant

04:43.183 --> 04:44.051
back and forth out there?

04:46.687 --> 04:48.722
Art and Karen are letting us
use their trailer for coats.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.958
Come on, Deej.

04:50.991 --> 04:55.128
Well, I'd better go change
out of my work clothes.

04:55.162 --> 04:57.431
Excuse me, mom.

04:57.465 --> 05:00.200
Sorry, dad.

05:00.233 --> 05:03.270
She didn't exactly seem too
thrilled about us being here.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.605
Maybe we should just go home.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.239
Oh, no way.

05:06.273 --> 05:08.175
Becky feels like crap
about her life right now,

05:08.208 --> 05:10.544
but she's not going to
do anything to change it

05:10.578 --> 05:12.713
till we light a fire under her.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.549
So tonight we are going
to pounce like sharks

05:15.583 --> 05:17.818
on a cramping swimmer.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.754
It'll be fun!

05:20.788 --> 05:23.424
You have a sickness.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.092
Obviously, the evil
little guy in your head

05:25.125 --> 05:26.460
finally beat up
the good little guy

05:26.494 --> 05:29.296
and chucked him
out the ear hole.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.564
Woman, Dan.

05:30.598 --> 05:33.434
Evil little woman in my head.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.403
BEV: Yoo-hoo, is this the one?

05:35.436 --> 05:38.739
All these tin trucks
look the same.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.674
And just to make
sure that Becky

05:40.708 --> 05:43.010
will end up feeling really
crappy about her life,

05:43.043 --> 05:45.546
I invited mom too.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.081
Come on in.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.349
Find me an empty lap, fellas.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.183
Bev's here.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.525
OK, now, listen,
this is the plan.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.760
We're going to try to
make Becky feel really,

05:59.793 --> 06:02.496
really good about her life, OK?

06:02.530 --> 06:05.999
So think of some really great
things to say about the place.

06:06.033 --> 06:10.404
Well, it must be nice
to vacuum the entire house

06:10.438 --> 06:12.039
and never have to
change outlets.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.411
Yeah.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.279
That's great, mom, but save it.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.682
Wait till Becky gets back here.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.551
Hi, grandma.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.986
You've never been to my
place before, have you?

06:26.019 --> 06:29.156
No, and it's lovely!

06:29.189 --> 06:34.394
It proves you can do a lot
with very, very, very little.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.163
Bev, can I get you a drink?

06:36.196 --> 06:39.032
We've got wine, beer.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.934
Beer.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.436
Beer?

06:42.470 --> 06:43.804
I'm in AA.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.740
And besides, I never drank beer.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.242
When I drank, it was wine.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.278
And I miss it.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.846
I'll have a glass of red wine.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.815
Thank you, Dan.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.550
No problem.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.851
Only 12 steps away.

07:02.189 --> 07:05.425
I'll be very careful
not to spill, dear.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.895
I don't think they make
this kind of carpet anymore.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.601
All right.

07:13.634 --> 07:16.604
I've been thinking all day
of nice, uplifting things

07:16.637 --> 07:17.805
I can say to Becky.

07:17.838 --> 07:18.706
Oh, great.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.675
Could I buy one off you?

07:21.709 --> 07:23.176
DAVID: Darlene, where
should I put this beer?

07:23.210 --> 07:26.346
Oh, go ahead and put it in
the kitchen unless, of course,

07:26.379 --> 07:29.216
we're already in the kitchen.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.351
Hey, come on in, everyone.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.352
[interposing voices]

07:32.385 --> 07:33.453
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.955
Sorry.

07:34.988 --> 07:38.225
(WHISPERING) Mark, you
said a couple of people.

07:38.258 --> 07:41.895
Yeah, but that's only a couple
people by the true definition

07:41.929 --> 07:44.598
of the word "people."

07:44.632 --> 07:46.534
Maybe you and your
girlfriend should come

07:46.567 --> 07:48.536
over and have dinner sometime.

07:48.569 --> 07:49.369
Are you a Jew?

07:57.344 --> 07:59.246
Hey, would you stop
flirting with me?

07:59.279 --> 08:02.482
I'm a married woman.

08:02.516 --> 08:05.285
Mark, your
toilet's overflowing!

08:05.318 --> 08:06.687
Dammit, that only
happens because people

08:06.720 --> 08:07.755
put too much paper in here.

08:07.788 --> 08:08.656
[coughs]

08:08.689 --> 08:10.824
The water's coming this way!

08:10.858 --> 08:14.094
You better stop it before
it gets to the carpet in here.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.395
Why doesn't everybody
in the kitchen

08:15.428 --> 08:19.199
take their shoes off and
sop it up with their socks?

08:19.232 --> 08:20.300
That's a good idea!

08:20.333 --> 08:21.201
Mark!

08:21.234 --> 08:22.102
Uh, you're right.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.236
Uh, bad idea.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.573
I'd better, um, jack up
this end of the trailer.

08:29.509 --> 08:34.481
Well, Becky, cheer up,
you've still got friends.

08:37.851 --> 08:38.852
A toast to Becky!

08:38.886 --> 08:39.753
Yeah.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.623
The richest woman in Lanford!

08:42.656 --> 08:44.524
[mumbles]

08:44.558 --> 08:47.695
(SOBBING) I'd like to
thank you all for being here

08:47.728 --> 08:50.230
on the worst night of my life.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.032
Excuse me.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.634
Pardon me.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.102
Dad, sorry.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.004
[grunts] [smacks head] Oh!

09:10.017 --> 09:13.654
How did I end up like this?

09:13.687 --> 09:18.025
This isn't exactly where
I expected to be at 21.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.593
I know.

09:19.627 --> 09:23.597
Well, it's all Mark's
fault. If he hadn't wasted

09:23.631 --> 09:25.465
the last four years
of my life, I'd be

09:25.498 --> 09:28.001
the one getting big job offers.

09:28.035 --> 09:31.404
I sure wouldn't be
living in this hellhole.

09:31.438 --> 09:34.608
You can't go blaming all
the problems you got on Mark.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.711
I mean, true, they
started when you met him

09:37.745 --> 09:38.979
and they have continued
the whole time

09:39.012 --> 09:40.380
you've been with him.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.216
And he was too dumb to know that
the party tonight would totally

09:43.250 --> 09:44.818
embarrass you, like it did.

09:44.852 --> 09:51.191
But where was I going with this?

09:51.224 --> 09:53.393
That it isn't Mark's fault.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.728
Exactly.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.530
Well, it's your
fault. Why didn't

09:57.564 --> 09:59.499
you stop me from marrying him?

09:59.532 --> 10:02.202
Hey, you eloped, remember?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.137
We did what we
could to stop you.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.206
And besides, that was
the night that the season

10:06.239 --> 10:07.808
premiere of "Cop Rock" was on.

10:11.144 --> 10:15.615
[sighs] What am
I going to do, mom?

10:15.649 --> 10:17.017
Oh, Becky.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.453
You still have a lot
of time to figure out

10:20.487 --> 10:21.955
what it is that's going
to make you happy,

10:21.989 --> 10:24.958
figure out how to do it,
and then go ahead and do it,

10:24.992 --> 10:26.559
you know?

10:26.593 --> 10:29.396
Don't waste what
you got like I did.

10:29.429 --> 10:32.833
You know, it's too late
for me, but you know,

10:32.866 --> 10:34.334
you're still young, Becky.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.669
Well, I'm already 21.

10:35.703 --> 10:36.503
I'm too old.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.741
To marry Jerry Seinfeld, yes.

10:47.848 --> 10:52.085
To anything else on earth, no.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.755
You know, Becky, we'll be there,
and we'll support you and help

10:54.788 --> 10:55.789
you, whatever we can do.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.557
But you're the one
that's going to have

10:57.590 --> 11:02.362
to make the change yourself.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.764
Thanks, mom.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.165
[rumbling]

11:05.198 --> 11:07.300
Oh, my god, I can't
believe he's actually

11:07.334 --> 11:09.569
jacking up the trailer.

11:09.602 --> 11:12.105
Why don't you just tell
him to pull that cork out

11:12.139 --> 11:13.140
of the hole in the floor?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.717
You threw a nice party, Mark.

11:23.751 --> 11:26.319
Oh, well, you looked a
little bit bummed out lately.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.922
I thought it would cheer you up.
- Thanks, it did.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.038
Mark?

11:45.072 --> 11:46.473
Oh, ha, sorry.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.648
Mark, this is something
I've never shown to you.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.284
It's from the
University of Illinois.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.618
I applied there
when I was a senior.

12:01.789 --> 12:02.689
Man, the post office sucks.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.864
Well, I was accepted, Mark.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.200
But we got married and
moved to Minneapolis.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.936
And now sometimes I wonder
what would have happened if I

12:15.969 --> 12:17.704
had gone to college instead.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.306
Well, I can tell you
what would have happened.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.774
It would have taken
us four years longer

12:20.808 --> 12:21.875
to get where we are today.

12:21.909 --> 12:22.709
Look.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.348
I want to go to college, Mark.

12:28.381 --> 12:32.219
I want to be a paramedic, or
a physical therapist, or--

12:32.252 --> 12:33.120
[laughs] Wait, wait.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.888
You want to be like a doctor?

12:34.922 --> 12:35.956
Yeah.

12:35.989 --> 12:36.857
Yeah.

12:36.890 --> 12:37.825
Well, maybe.

12:37.858 --> 12:38.725
I don't know, I don't know.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.793
The sky's the limit.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.061
[scoffs] Becky, this is crazy.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.763
You're talking about a lot
of money here and moving.

12:43.797 --> 12:46.766
Hey, look, I know it'll be
hard, but it'll be exciting.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.201
Where's this coming
from all of a sudden?

12:48.235 --> 12:49.469
What about the plans we have?

12:49.502 --> 12:52.139
We never had plans, Mark.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.841
You go to work,
I go to work, we

12:53.874 --> 12:56.176
go to my parents' on Sundays.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.913
Every week is the same and will
be for the rest of our lives.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.414
What about our plans
to start a family?

13:01.448 --> 13:02.649
Or have you forgotten
that we've been

13:02.682 --> 13:05.785
trying like hell to have a kid?

13:05.819 --> 13:10.190
Actually, Mark, I want
to go back on the pill.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.026
[stammers] What?

13:13.060 --> 13:17.397
But it was loads of
fun trying, big guy.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.299
I can't believe all
that sex was for nothing.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.705
Come on, Mark.

13:25.738 --> 13:28.341
No, Becky.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.110
You don't want to have a
baby and you hate your life.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.011
What's going on?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.379
Nothing.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.780
I've just been
thinking about things,

13:33.813 --> 13:35.682
and I got to talking to
mom tonight, and you know--

13:35.715 --> 13:36.884
Oh, oh, I knew it.

13:36.917 --> 13:37.951
I knew your mother had
something to do with this.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.552
Man, she is playing
us like a fine wine.

13:43.857 --> 13:46.726
She has a point, Mark.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.229
And what if I was pregnant?

13:49.262 --> 13:50.931
I'd be trapped just
like her, and I

13:50.964 --> 13:52.966
don't want to spend
the rest of my life

13:53.000 --> 13:55.702
raising kids in a trailer park.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.737
It's a mobile home community.

14:07.180 --> 14:12.419
Hey, I'm sorry if I sprang
this on you too suddenly.

14:12.452 --> 14:16.123
But do you have any idea
what this'll mean for us?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.024
Yup.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.558
Yup.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.127
I know what it means, all right.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.436
(IN BABY VOICE) You've
got the cutest widdle

14:29.469 --> 14:30.837
face in this whole family.

14:30.870 --> 14:31.871
Huh?

14:31.905 --> 14:34.041
Who's the prettiest,
cutest widdle face

14:34.074 --> 14:36.443
in this whole family?

14:36.476 --> 14:39.012
You do, mother.

14:39.046 --> 14:42.582
Well, thank you very much.

14:42.615 --> 14:43.951
Big boy!

14:43.984 --> 14:45.485
Hey, can I talk
to you for a minute?

14:45.518 --> 14:48.721
What you want
talk about, Mark?

14:48.755 --> 14:50.023
I just have one
thing to say to you--

14:50.057 --> 14:52.059
get the hell out of our lives.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.127
You got it?

14:54.161 --> 14:57.030
Pretty gutsy there, Mark.

14:57.064 --> 15:00.867
But you know that David and
Goliath was just a story

15:00.900 --> 15:02.102
they made up to sell Bibles.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.573
You have no right to
tell Becky that she should

15:06.606 --> 15:08.375
do stuff to change her life.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.742
Why?

15:09.776 --> 15:11.878
She's pretty well wasted it
up till now, don't you think?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.580
Well, maybe it hasn't
been perfect, OK?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.082
But it's been pretty good.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.683
There's no reason for
her to go to college,

15:16.716 --> 15:20.387
become a physical therapist,
or a doctor, or something.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.454
Doctor, huh?

15:21.488 --> 15:24.257
Wow, way to go, Becky.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.759
Now all I have to
do is to create

15:26.793 --> 15:30.663
a lawyer and a union plumber,
and I shall control the world.

15:35.802 --> 15:38.138
It's going to ruin everything.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.372
How, Mark?

15:39.406 --> 15:42.442
How is having a successful
wife who is a doctor

15:42.475 --> 15:44.044
going to ruin everything?

15:44.077 --> 15:45.912
Well, she's talking about
me quitting my job already

15:45.945 --> 15:47.547
and us moving out of Lanford.

15:47.580 --> 15:48.881
Well, no need to fear, Mark.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.118
I'm sure that your
McDonald's game pieces

15:51.151 --> 15:54.821
are negotiable in other states.

15:54.854 --> 15:57.157
And we were going to
start having a family.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.426
Now all of a sudden,
she wants to wait.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.895
And she decides all this
without even talking to me.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.797
You mean she didn't talk
to you about any of that?

16:04.831 --> 16:06.066
No, No, she just
went ahead and made

16:06.099 --> 16:08.001
all these ridiculous
plans without me.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.336
And let me ask you this.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.704
How is she going to go
to college, go to work,

16:11.738 --> 16:14.207
and still have time for me?

16:14.241 --> 16:15.175
I don't know.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.843
She's a real strong
person, Mark.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.345
I'm sure if anybody
can do it, she can.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.246
Mm.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.914
Do you think she
can do it alone?

16:21.948 --> 16:23.116
Oh, alone?

16:23.150 --> 16:24.084
Why, Mark?

16:24.117 --> 16:25.685
Are you going to
leave her over this?

16:25.718 --> 16:27.887
I would not leave your
daughter for anything.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.056
So what?

16:29.089 --> 16:30.623
Are you scared that
she's going to leave you?

16:30.657 --> 16:33.560
Well, she's been cutting
me out of everything else.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.628
[scoffs] Don't
worry about it, Mark.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.364
It's just the usual
Becky selfishness.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.965
I'll go over there
and talk to her.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.667
No, no, no, that's
the whole point.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.469
I came over here to tell
you to butt out of our lives

16:42.502 --> 16:43.303
and to leave us alone.

16:55.615 --> 16:56.549
Hey.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.418
Hey, what are you doing here?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.820
Well, I just
thought I you know,

17:00.853 --> 17:03.756
wanted to talk to
you about more stuff.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.758
It's not necessary, mom.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.894
I'm way ahead of you.

17:07.927 --> 17:09.596
Look, I figure I'm
a lock at U of I

17:09.629 --> 17:11.598
because they accepted me before.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.966
Now, for grad school, I'm
thinking maybe University

17:14.000 --> 17:15.968
of Chicago or Northwestern.

17:16.002 --> 17:18.171
What do you think?

17:18.205 --> 17:19.406
Well, I think it's
fantastic, but--

17:19.439 --> 17:20.373
Yeah, me too.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.908
And I'm also thinking of--

17:21.941 --> 17:23.643
But--

17:23.676 --> 17:24.911
What's the "but?"

17:24.944 --> 17:26.346
Mark is the "but."

17:32.051 --> 17:36.623
No, I must keep
going with my point.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.958
Mark is totally
freaking out because you

17:38.991 --> 17:41.194
haven't even
consulted him in all

17:41.228 --> 17:42.795
these plans you've been making.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.631
He talked to you?

17:44.664 --> 17:45.765
No, it's more than that.

17:45.798 --> 17:49.236
He came over and he, uh,
actually stood up to me.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.939
But luckily for him,
I'd already eaten.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.507
What are you getting at, mom?

17:54.541 --> 17:56.943
I think you're being a
little selfish here, Becky,

17:56.976 --> 17:58.811
and I think, you
know, maybe you're

17:58.845 --> 18:00.280
going to mess up your marriage.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.881
Oh, please, mother.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.651
My marriage is going
to be just fine.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.553
Well then, how come Mark
has this feeling like he's

18:06.586 --> 18:07.820
going to be left behind?

18:07.854 --> 18:10.190
Mark's not going
to be left anywhere.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.358
OK, so--

18:11.391 --> 18:12.692
You don't know what
you're talking about, god.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.127
So you're totally
determined that you're

18:14.161 --> 18:15.195
going to stay with Mark then?

18:19.799 --> 18:20.600
I asked you a question.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.672
Oh, my god.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.340
So in your head,
it's already over?

18:27.374 --> 18:28.175
No.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.412
I don't know.

18:32.445 --> 18:36.249
Hey, you're the one who got
me going to change my life.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.551
Yeah, but I didn't mean
that you should throw out

18:38.585 --> 18:39.986
all these other
parts of your life

18:40.019 --> 18:41.721
just because you get
a new idea, Becky.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.693
You've got to give
Mark a chance at least.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.595
I mean, marriage is
a big deal, you know?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.363
Mark really loves you.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.031
You don't want to mess this up.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.533
Hey, trust me.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.735
Everything's going to be OK.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.937
Yeah, well, you know,
it's one thing to say that.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.172
Mom.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.407
Everything's going to be OK.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.413
Now I'm going to go to
the office supply store.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.548
You need anything?

19:08.581 --> 19:09.382
An office.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.189
Hey.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.658
Hey.

19:18.691 --> 19:19.759
Where are you going?

19:19.792 --> 19:21.428
I'm going to get some
envelopes and stamps

19:21.461 --> 19:22.695
for those college applications.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.496
I'll be right back.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.703
What are you doing here?

19:30.737 --> 19:32.539
I thought I told
you to butt out.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.040
Now I find you
here and she's gone

19:34.073 --> 19:35.508
off to get more college stuff.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.576
OK.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.278
But you're totally
wrong about Becky, Mark,

19:38.311 --> 19:40.280
because she has no plans
to leave you at all.

19:40.313 --> 19:43.250
She wants to do
all this with you.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.584
Mrs. Conner, let
me ask you this.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.720
How many mechanics do you know
that are married to doctors?

19:51.624 --> 19:53.059
Congratulations,
Mrs. Conner, you've

19:53.092 --> 19:55.628
really worked this out pretty
well for yourself, haven't you?

19:55.662 --> 19:59.399
You get a doctor in the family,
and you finally get rid of me.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.334
And deep down, don't tell me
you're not happy about it.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.338
Now, I got to work
in the morning.

20:26.993 --> 20:27.927
Hi.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.329
I'm David Healy.

20:29.362 --> 20:32.832
You've been assigned to be my
employment counselor, Mr., uh--

20:32.865 --> 20:35.201
Parkin.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.104
[clears throat] I've
been reviewing your file.

20:38.137 --> 20:40.473
Hey, Mr. Parkin, you're
the guy Mrs. Conner

20:40.507 --> 20:42.475
got fired from the Buy and Bag.

20:42.509 --> 20:43.310
Conner?

20:46.379 --> 20:47.647
You know Roseanne C--

20:47.680 --> 20:49.215
C-- Conner?

20:49.248 --> 20:50.583
I thought you worked
at that restaurant

20:50.617 --> 20:51.751
that we ate at last week.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.487
I did but thanks
to your Ms. Conner,

20:54.521 --> 20:56.255
I was fired from there too.

20:56.289 --> 20:59.225
She got me so upset
I broke a glass.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.528
You got fired for
breaking a glass.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.996
Into her salad.

21:04.030 --> 21:07.400
Well, uh, that-- that won't
affect our relationship,

21:07.434 --> 21:08.735
will it?

21:08.768 --> 21:11.538
You listen to me, you
snot-nosed little bastard.

21:11.571 --> 21:16.142
You're associated with
the Conners, [whimpers]

21:16.175 --> 21:17.877
there's no jobs here for you.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.580
[whimpers] Get out!

21:20.613 --> 21:22.248
Parkin, what the
hell is wrong with you?

21:22.281 --> 21:23.316
He's one of them.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.351
He's a Conner.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.818
I don't care who he is.

21:25.852 --> 21:26.919
You are fired.

21:31.324 --> 21:32.124
Of course I am.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.331
This isn't over.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.833
This is far, far from over.

21:45.338 --> 21:48.240
Could you hand me my
nameplate, please?
