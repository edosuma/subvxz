00:14.200 --> 00:17.158
I'm reprogramming
the CTU key card right now.

00:17.240 --> 00:22.234
Good. Couriers are delivering the canisters
to the targets. They'll be in place soon.

00:22.320 --> 00:27.997
- When are you launching the attacks?
- After youre done at CTU.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.909
When these terrorists attack,
you'll need to maintain order.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.610
We should think of a
pre-emptive declaration

00:34.651 --> 00:37.393
of martial law in the
greater Los Angeles area.

00:37.480 --> 00:41.234
If CTU can't find this man Bierko,
we're donna get hit.

00:41.640 --> 00:44.518
Why didn't you just tell me you were alive?

00:44.600 --> 00:48.229
If you knew I was alive you would
have been at risk. I had no choice.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.629
I'm happy that you're alive. I am.

00:50.720 --> 00:53.439
But I can't give you
what you want right now.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.519
Michelle's murder was part of a bigger plan

00:56.600 --> 00:59.114
to supply terrorists with Sentox nerve gas.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.237
- Who was behind it?
- Christopher Henderson.

01:02.320 --> 01:07.075
Whatever he's not telling us is important.
He can tolerate an inhuman amount of pain.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.231
Thousands of
lives are at stake.

01:09.312 --> 01:12.996
Tell me what I need to know
to stop this insanity. Please.

01:13.080 --> 01:16.356
I'm sorry, Jack,
but I can't tell you what you hanna know.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.273
This is Bauer.

01:19.360 --> 01:24.673
We've been compromised. Someone used
a stolen key card to access CTU.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.228
Freeze! Drop the gun.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.552
Bill, it's Jack.
I th i n k he tried to deploy nerve gas.

01:32.640 --> 01:36.679
Code six! Everybody out! Go! Go!

01:36.760 --> 01:38.557
Seal all the rooms.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.873
Oh, no.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.359
Oh, my God.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.110
Chloe.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.713
Attention all CTU personnel.

02:14.800 --> 02:19.191
This facility has been contaminated
with Sentox VX-1 nerve gas.

02:19.280 --> 02:23.796
I repeat, this facility
has been contaminated.

02:23.880 --> 02:28.317
There are two safe zones. On the main
floor, in the situation room and Medical.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.870
On the second floor,
the safe zones are the CTU director's once,

02:31.960 --> 02:34.554
and holding room four.

02:35.120 --> 02:40.069
These areas must remain sealedpending
the arrival of the Chemical Response Team.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.835
'you are in any of these sealed areas,
do not attempt to leave

02:43.920 --> 02:47.515
until the CRT clears the environment.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.878
I'm on my way, but it could take 30 minutes
to gather all the CRT personnel you need.

02:51.960 --> 02:56.317
I understand, Curtis, but we need CRT here
now. This is a high priority.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.907
Get here as fast as you can.

02:57.908 --> 03:00.598
Copy. I'll call in a
few minutes with updates.

03:02.520 --> 03:04.909
Excuse me.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.276
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Bill. Ijust talked to Curtis.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.351
He's with the Chemical Response Team.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.477
- They won't get here for at least 30 minutes.
- Why not?

03:13.560 --> 03:17.872
Most were sent to Tyler Memorial. The rest
are en route to high probability targets.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.599
We'll keep working.
Our networks are up, right?

03:20.680 --> 03:25.037
The phones are working, computers are up.
I can coordinate with Division from here.

03:25.120 --> 03:28.112
- What do you need?
- I need to know if Henderson's alive.

03:28.200 --> 03:28.876
Where is he?

03:28.877 --> 03:31.636
Agent Burke took him
to the isolation clinic.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.756
I don't know if they made it.

03:33.840 --> 03:37.674
- You can tell if you pull up a grid.
- What about CTU'S response plan?

03:37.760 --> 03:40.832
Gas masks are in the armoury,
atropine's in storage.

03:40.920 --> 03:45.118
80th areas are contaminated.
We can't get to them without being exposed.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.478
Bill, I'm donna have to get right back to you.

03:52.560 --> 03:56.678
Chloe, I know how difficult this is,
but there's nothing we can do for him.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.433
I need you to come back to work.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.592
Tell me how to pull up a building grid.
I'll do it myself.

04:02.680 --> 04:06.036
- Jack, we can try to pull it up.
- Get started.

04:07.040 --> 04:11.989
Chloe, CTU is immobile right now.
Everything is going to go through Comm.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.197
That's you. I need you back at work.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.678
- Can't
- Yes, you can.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.113
- I can't
- Yes, you can!

04:18.200 --> 04:20.315
Mr Bauer.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.599
- What?
- I can help her.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.716
I'm a clinical psychologist.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.270
Thank you.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.872
Chloe.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.953
My name's Dr Landes.
He was a friend of yours. What was his name?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.996
- Edgar.
- Edgar.

04:52.080 --> 04:55.436
I'd like you to turn away from Edgar
and focus on me please.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.238
Chloe,

04:57.320 --> 05:01.438
you're in shock,
and I'd like to help you through it.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.752
The only thing I'm donna ask you to do
is sit in this chair and collect your breath.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.070
Let's do that now.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.752
Just collect your breath, just for a second.

05:21.240 --> 05:26.268
He was such a good guy.
I just treated him like crap all day.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.838
- This is my fault.
- Sir?

05:36.080 --> 05:39.152
Someone stole my key card
and used it to get in the building.

05:39.240 --> 05:42.915
It was missing, and I didn't say anything.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.235
- Why not?
- I thought they stole my wallet for money.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.914
How could you not report it?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.639
I was embarrassed.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.951
I didn't want anyone to know I got beat up.

05:57.040 --> 06:01.113
So we're all donna die
because you were embarrassed?

06:06.560 --> 06:09.472
- What are you doing?
- I hanna know what's going on.

06:09.560 --> 06:13.599
- No, I can't allow that.
- I won't sit in bed while CTU'S under attack.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.352
Fi ne.

06:15.440 --> 06:20.434
- How long are we supposed to be like this?
- I haven't received any news.

06:20.520 --> 06:22.750
Oh, my God.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.593
Jack, we've got the building grid.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.870
- Buchanan.
- It's Jack. The grid's up.

06:33.960 --> 06:38.829
All right. Check the isolation zones
that have logged in. They'll have survivors.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.150
Two zones have logged on in Medical.

06:41.240 --> 06:45.153
- Try them. I'm donna keep this line open.
- OK. Hold on.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.830
- Cll n i c.
- Dr Besson, it's Jack Bauer.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.114
What's going on?

06:50.200 --> 06:55.354
A terrorist infiltrated CTU and deployed
Sentox through the ventilation system.

06:55.440 --> 07:00.798
That's why we sealed off rooms. I need to
know if Burke got to Medical with Henderson.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.792
- Yes, he did.
- Henderson's here right now?

07:03.880 --> 07:07.190
- Tony, is that you?
- How long are we donna be locked down?

07:07.280 --> 07:12.798
Right now we're in stand-by. Weke trying
to figure out how to clean out the air supply.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.552
Doctor Besson?

07:14.640 --> 07:16.915
Doctor Besson?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.877
Tony?

07:19.800 --> 07:22.792
- Get a security feed.
- This program's not set up for that.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.429
Try a redirect. Doctor Besson?

07:42.960 --> 07:44.757
- What are you doing?
- Move aside.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.230
All right, I've got video.

07:48.320 --> 07:51.437
Oh, God. He's got a gun.
Patch me through to their intercom.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.159
- Do it.
- We can hear them, but they can't hear us.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.789
- Don't kill him. He's got information be need.
- He killed my wifed

07:57.880 --> 08:00.519
- Tony, please, don't kill him.
- Move aside.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.478
I don't want to shoot you, but I will. Move it!

08:07.960 --> 08:09.837
You remember me?

08:09.920 --> 08:12.195
My name is Tony Almeida.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.078
You killed my wife,
Michelle Dessler, this morning.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.515
He's donna kill him. Hurry. Hurry!

08:17.600 --> 08:21.354
She was my life, and you took her.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.593
And now I'm donna take yours.

08:25.160 --> 08:28.152
- I got it.
- Tony, I've got you on the secu rity feed.

08:28.240 --> 08:31.073
- Stay out of this, Jack.
- Please, just listen to me.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.230
You can't do this.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.879
I know how you feel right now.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.635
I lost Teri the exact same way,
to one of our own.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.871
I know what it feels to be betrayed like this.

08:47.440 --> 08:52.878
But, Tony, Henderson has information that
can save thousands and thousands of lives.

08:52.960 --> 08:58.557
And I know that doesn't make you feel
better right now, but I know you, Tony.

08:58.640 --> 09:03.634
I know you don't want
to make this situation any worse than it is.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.631
Please.

09:08.520 --> 09:12.069
Please just let us finish our interrogation.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.154
Hurry up.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.989
Agent Burke, please continue.
When Henderson starts talking,

09:26.080 --> 09:31.598
focus on how to find the Sentox canisters
and how we can find Bierko.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.076
Tell me where to find Bierko.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.473
Where?

09:44.600 --> 09:46.556
Nowhere.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.635
What is your computer password?

09:49.720 --> 09:51.711
No.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.439
No password.

09:55.640 --> 10:00.316
- Agent Burke, can we increase the dose?
- Not without killing him.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.870
Take a break then start again.
Get back to me when you've got anything.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.951
Yes, sir.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.595
- How could CTU be hit?
- We're not sure, Mr Vice President.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.319
Are you telling me
they didn't have any safeguards?

10:16.400 --> 10:19.153
They had partial containment,
but reports indicate

10:19.240 --> 10:22.198
that 40% of their personnel
have been taken out.

10:22.280 --> 10:26.068
- You mean, they've been killed.
- I'm afraid so, sir.

10:26.160 --> 10:30.676
CTU is protecting this city. Are you saying
they're no longer capable of doing that?

10:30.760 --> 10:33.115
They've been seriously compromised, yes.

10:33.200 --> 10:38.593
What are we going to do? We've got terrorists
with nerve gas out there. Who will stop them?

10:38.680 --> 10:42.878
- I suggest an emergency restructuring.
- Meaning what?

10:42.960 --> 10:46.555
The Chemical Response Team will go in,
neutralize the gas at CTU,

10:46.640 --> 10:50.838
and I will take a team in there
and personally manage the operation.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.195
- How soon can you do that?
- Within the hour.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.510
- Fine. Do it.
- Yes, sfr.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.751
All right. We're operational.
It's not a complete disaster.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.308
Mr President, it is.

11:01.400 --> 11:05.393
I can see no other option but to impose
martial law on the city of Los Angeles.

11:05.480 --> 11:10.793
My advisors believe if the military takes over
and detains people, it could create mayhem.

11:10.880 --> 11:14.873
It's only a matter of time before
more canisters are released in public places

11:14.960 --> 11:18.475
and you will have mayhem,
except without soldiers to contain it.

11:18.560 --> 11:23.315
What do I tell the public? We've got nerve gas
all over the city, but we don't know where?

11:23.400 --> 11:27.598
You don't have to get into that.
Tie it to that earlier incident at the airport.

11:27.680 --> 11:32.037
- I'm going to get resistance from all sides.
- That's true, sir.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.908
We may have to swallow some saltwater,
but wouldn't it be worth it?

11:36.000 --> 11:40.278
If we can keep the people off the streets,
safe from another public attack?

11:40.360 --> 11:43.636
- I don't know, Hal.
- Sir, consider this.

11:43.720 --> 11:47.633
If we clear the streets
of everybody except the military,

11:47.720 --> 11:51.110
these terrorists won't be able to move
as freely as they are now.

11:51.200 --> 11:56.069
We have to do whatever we can
to stop the people behind this.

12:02.320 --> 12:06.279
CTU is no longer an obstacle,
at least for the time being.

12:06.360 --> 12:11.195
Good. Have our men move from their
current positions and go to the new target.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.431
How much of the nerve gas
will they release there?

12:32.800 --> 12:35.189
Excuse me.

12:38.880 --> 12:42.077
- Chloe, are you ready to go back to work?
- What do you need?

12:42.160 --> 12:47.518
You. We can't break Henderson. I need you
to try to decrypt the files from his computer.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.319
I tried. It didn't work.
Maybe somebody else can do it.

12:50.400 --> 12:54.075
Chloe, you're the only person
in the room qualified.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.754
Chloe, please. Don't shut down on me now.

12:56.840 --> 13:02.278
I'm upset about everything too, but you know
how it works. We do not quit until it's over.

13:02.360 --> 13:07.150
You're not helping her.
You're just making things worse.

13:10.120 --> 13:13.590
I am sure that you are qualified
to help someone through distress

13:13.680 --> 13:18.071
over an extended period of time, but we
do not have an extended period of time.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.675
If you don't mind stepping aside
so I can do my job, I'd appreciate it.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.594
You don't have to be qualified to help people,
you just have to be there.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.831
Like you were there for my daughter.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.195
What does that mean?

13:33.000 --> 13:36.310
You're 20 years older than she is.
I know what you're doing.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.632
I've done nothing but try and help her. How
dare you accuse me of taking advantage?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.312
You did.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.994
Dad, you can be angry at me all you want.

13:45.080 --> 13:49.471
But before I met Barry, I didn't want to live.
Do you understand that?

13:51.280 --> 13:54.477
Fine, I'll get back to work.
If everyone could just relax.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.870
Jack, we have a problem.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.629
What?

14:04.720 --> 14:07.359
Chloe, I just saw the alarm. What's going on?

14:07.440 --> 14:12.673
Pressure indicators in contaminated zones
are showing traces of sublimated polymer.

14:12.760 --> 14:17.834
- What does that mean?
- The nerve gas must be mixed with an acid.

14:17.920 --> 14:21.390
The acid's breaking down
the seal between the rooms.

14:21.480 --> 14:25.837
- How long till the seal fails completely?
- It's hard to say for sure.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.832
- Give me an estimate.
- It's deteriorating quickly.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.992
- 15 minutes, 20 at the most.
- And then what?

14:32.800 --> 14:35.951
Gas permeates the seal and enters the room.
Then it's over.

14:36.040 --> 14:39.555
Get me schematics on all the isolated zones.

14:47.560 --> 14:52.793
Mr Vice President, with all due respect,
I'm not trying to usurp your position.

14:52.880 --> 14:57.795
I'm simply trying to serve the president
the best way I can.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.269
Yes, si r.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.270
What was that about?

15:05.400 --> 15:09.871
I was trying to convince Gardner to let me
help him draft the president's statement.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.713
Charles is letting Hal write his statement?

15:12.800 --> 15:17.351
He's insisted.
And the president gave him the go-ahead.

15:17.440 --> 15:20.989
That means Gardner's effectively
making policy. You gotta stop him.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.752
1. rrl t rh!i rl (j.

15:22.840 --> 15:26.992
But you know the pressure he's under today.
He wants all the counsel he can get.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.071
And Hal's only too eager to help out.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.277
Of course he's eager.
He's got his eye on the Oval Office.

15:32.360 --> 15:36.797
Anything he can do to speed up Charles's
downfall puts him closer to the presidency.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.438
Martha,

15:38.520 --> 15:40.875
you have to intervene.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.190
Hal feeds the president ideas.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.748
We saw it at the WTO. We saw it in Chicago.

15:45.840 --> 15:51.198
When they work, Hal takes the credit for 'em.
When they don't, the president takes the hits.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.874
- Have you reminded Charles of that?
- I can't.

15:53.960 --> 15:58.351
Hal's the vice president.
I'm just the Chief of Staff.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.590
You have influence
that supersedes any constitutional rank.

16:04.680 --> 16:08.070
And now's the time to use it.

16:13.400 --> 16:18.076
- I want to see the statement when it's issued.
- You will.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.192
I checked the readings
from all uncontaminated zones.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.829
The testing you've been doing
in your respective areas is consistent.

16:29.920 --> 16:33.993
The Sentox gas released into the air duct
system contains a corrosive agent

16:34.080 --> 16:37.390
that is eating a-ay
at the barrier seals protecting safe zones.

16:37.480 --> 16:41.871
I'm not donna pull anypunches.
CRT will not be here in time to help us.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.520
At this point,
our only hope is to help ourselves.

16:44.600 --> 16:49.993
be need to find a way to either neutralist
or flush the Sentox out of contaminated areas

16:50.080 --> 16:54.232
before the barrier seals fail,
and the gas enters the safe zones.

16:54.320 --> 16:58.757
I want all personnel working on this problem.
be don't have much time.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.149
Do what you can.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.879
We'll hope for the best.

17:03.960 --> 17:07.077
Maybe we can do something.
Access the ventilation system.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.196
Even if I could,
it doesn't mean we could do anything.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.271
Just try.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.834
Maybe it's not so bad.
Maybe the numbers are off.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.353
They're not.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.954
Even if the seals leak,
CRT could get here in time.

17:25.960 --> 17:30.238
The only reason she's here
is because I asked her to stay.

17:31.240 --> 17:34.994
If something happens to her,
it's going to be because of what I did.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.913
There is no way you could know
that CTU was vulnerable.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.070
Jack.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.513
Have you got something?

17:41.600 --> 17:45.798
If I slow the seals' breakdown, I can
flush the area using the air conditioning.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.871
t) it.

17:49.480 --> 17:52.233
- Something's wrong. It isn't responding.
- Why not?

17:52.320 --> 17:54.880
It's being blocked
by some program I can't get to,

17:54.960 --> 17:57.315
probably on a computer near holding four.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.661
Can you get me in there?

17:58.742 --> 18:01.393
This is a false wall.
The air in there is clean.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.835
- Can he get to the computer?
- Yes.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.832
But after the safe zone,
he'll be in a contaminated area.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.388
What? He can't go through
a contaminated area.

18:09.480 --> 18:13.155
I can hold my breath. Sentox
won't be absorbed over that short a time.

18:13.240 --> 18:16.630
- I'll be fine.
- You can't hold your breath that long.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.737
I only have to get
to the computer,

18:18.818 --> 18:21.874
disconnect the program and
get to the ventilated room.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.838
Once I'm back,
how long will it take to clear the Sentox?

18:24.920 --> 18:28.037
About 20 seconds,
based on the cubic footage.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.639
Jack, what if we can't
ventilate that room?

18:31.720 --> 18:34.518
Chloe thinks we can.
This is our only option.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.832
- CRT is not donna get here in time.
- The seals are now 80% gone.

18:38.920 --> 18:42.959
- What's the bottom line?
- We have less than 20 minutes.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.953
We are on channel one. If you need
anyone else, we'll patch you through.

18:47.040 --> 18:50.191
As soon as I go through,
you have to replace this behind me.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.078
Jack, it's time. Go now.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.116
Now.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.342
Chloe, I just
completed the airlock.

20:07.423 --> 20:10.195
I'm getting ready to move
into the ventilation room.

20:10.280 --> 20:13.272
I'll tap my comm unit
when I'm back in the safe room.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.959
All right. Jack, if
that airlock leaks, we'll

20:16.040 --> 20:18.388
all be dead within
the next three minutes.

20:18.480 --> 20:21.313
It's not donna leak, Chloe.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.277
OK.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.033
- I'm going in.
- OK.

21:28.440 --> 21:31.989
- The seal corrosion is now at 86%.
- Is there anything we can do here?

21:32.080 --> 21:35.516
Just wait. There's nothing we can do
to get your dad out any faster.

21:35.600 --> 21:39.912
- Don't talk down to me, Chloe.
- Listen, we're in a crisis situation here, OK?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.753
Tempers are bound to flare.
Just everybody breathe.

21:42.840 --> 21:47.789
What's with you and the breathing?
Is that your solution to everything?

21:54.720 --> 21:57.188
- He's back in the room.
- It's too soon.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.670
He couldn't have found the program
and disabled it yet.

22:00.760 --> 22:04.514
He's got 15 more seconds
before the room clears.

22:05.560 --> 22:08.233
- What's it mean that he's finished?
- I don't know.

22:08.320 --> 22:11.039
- It could be good, right?
- It could be good or bad.

22:11.120 --> 22:14.396
That's what... I don't know" means.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.275
All right, the room is clear. Are you OK?

22:21.920 --> 22:24.718
I couldn't get to it.
Chloe, you're right, I saw it.

22:24.800 --> 22:29.590
There's a program running on the AC control,
but there's a security grate behind the vent.

22:29.680 --> 22:33.309
- I don't see it on my system.
- Trust me, it's there.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.955
I just found it. It was a security upgrade
in the last two years.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.793
Somebody didn't file it properly
so I didn't see it.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.916
Are there other vents into that wall?

22:45.000 --> 22:48.993
- They've all been upgraded.
- There's gotta be a door. Where does it lead?

22:49.080 --> 22:52.356
To a corridor above holding four.
None of us can get there.

22:52.440 --> 22:55.000
- Who's in holding room four?
- Lynn McGill.

22:55.080 --> 22:57.548
Are there any vented rooms
we can get him to?

22:57.640 --> 22:59.870
No, Jack. There's nothing.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.598
Patch me through to him.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.355
- McGill here.
- Lynn, it's Jack.

23:12.440 --> 23:15.079
be found a computer interrupt
in the AC control.

23:15.160 --> 23:19.597
If we shut that down in the next few minutes,
we can stop the gas permeating safe zones.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.591
Well, that's good news.

23:21.680 --> 23:25.559
The problem is, youre the only person
close enough to get to it. Chloe?

23:25.640 --> 23:27.756
It's above the room where you are now.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.389
Take the stairs, go around the corner,
it's the room on your left.

23:31.480 --> 23:34.392
OK. How are we donna do this, Jack?

23:34.480 --> 23:37.102
Lynn, the truth is if I
could get there, I would

23:37.103 --> 23:39.349
do this myself, but
I'm not close enough.

23:39.440 --> 23:42.591
No one still alive is.
You're the only person who can do this.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.910
But you have to do it without protection.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.878
- I see.
- No, you don et.

23:47.960 --> 23:51.635
As soon as you open the door
your room will become contaminated.

23:51.720 --> 23:57.078
You can hold your breath long enough
to fix the problem, but we can't airlock you.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.594
There are two of us in here, Jack.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.478
Sir, this is Harry Swinton.

24:02.560 --> 24:07.156
So you're saying that if he does this,
then we're both donna die?

24:07.240 --> 24:09.435
I'm so sorry

24:09.520 --> 24:11.715
We don't have a choice, Harry.

24:11.800 --> 24:16.271
How do we know that you're not making this
up so you don't have to sacrifice yourself?

24:16.360 --> 24:20.751
You don't. All I can ask you to do
is believe me. I'm telling you the truth.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.718
That's easy for you to say, sir.
You're not about to die.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.598
It's not easy for me to say.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.079
Hold on.

24:32.080 --> 24:38.633
We have to do this, Harry. We're donna die
anyway. If we don't, so will everyone in CTU.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.431
We have to do this.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.833
OK, Jack. Go ahead.

24:49.920 --> 24:53.993
Once you get into the ventilation room,
the computer will be on your right.

24:54.080 --> 24:57.834
There's a program running
on the computer. You need to quit out of it.

24:57.920 --> 25:00.878
Lynn, be don't have a lot of time.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.791
Chloe,

25:32.880 --> 25:36.873
I'm sorry about how I acted earlier,
and about your friend that died.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.757
OK.

25:38.840 --> 25:42.833
- Thanks.
- I've been wanting to ask you something.

25:42.920 --> 25:47.198
Did you have contact with my dad
while he was gone?

25:47.280 --> 25:50.955
- I sent him information about once a month.
- What kind of information?

25:51.040 --> 25:53.873
- A lot of different things.
- About me?

25:54.480 --> 25:59.349
Actually, almost all of it was about you.
Your break-up with Chase, your depression.

25:59.440 --> 26:03.194
- How did you get...
- I'm really good at getting information.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.794
I don't judge it, I just pass it on.

26:05.880 --> 26:09.395
I'm sorry about you and Chase.
It must have been really painful.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.755
Yeah. It was.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.876
So you talked to him too?

26:13.960 --> 26:17.157
- Chase? No.
- You know where he is?

26:17.240 --> 26:21.392
- No, but I could find out if you want.
- No, no. It's all right.

26:21.480 --> 26:25.109
Barry thinks I should let that go.
He's probably right.

26:25.200 --> 26:31.469
Yeah, well, shrinks are always giving advice
that they probably don't follow themselves.

26:31.560 --> 26:36.111
- How are you doing?
- I woke up with a guy I'll never see again.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.888
And I just watched one
of my best friends die

26:38.889 --> 26:41.752
right in front of me, so
I guess not that great.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.078
Yeah.

26:57.920 --> 27:03.233
Replace the panel. Pull up the security feed
from the observation room.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.678
You be a good girl for Mommy, OK?

27:07.760 --> 27:11.036
If she tells you you have to go to bed,
you have to go to bed.

27:11.120 --> 27:15.636
- fgfr# When are you coming home?
- I don't know, honey.

27:15.720 --> 27:19.918
- Ifl fall asleep, will you wake me up?
- Of course I will.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.956
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.712
OK.

27:23.800 --> 27:27.509
I'm going in now, Harry. Say goodbye.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.558
- I love you.
- I love you too, Daddy.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.630
Bye, baby girl.

27:36.040 --> 27:38.429
Chloe, we're ready. I'm going in.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.997
OK. Good luck. And thanks for doing this.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.191
Yeah.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.592
- He did it.
- Is the AC responding?

28:37.680 --> 28:40.877
- Yes.
- How long before the Sentox is neutralized?

28:40.960 --> 28:45.636
At least 15 minutes. But it should stop
eating away at the seals immediately.

28:45.720 --> 28:49.838
Polymer count is down. It looks like
the seals will hold until all zones are clear.

28:55.200 --> 28:59.637
Lynn, Harry, I don't know if you can still
hear me, but what you did was successful.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.950
The seals are holding.

29:03.280 --> 29:08.559
I will personally notify your families
and tell them of the sacrifice you made.

29:08.640 --> 29:11.473
I'm so sorry

29:11.560 --> 29:13.710
I don't know what else to say.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.791
Thank you.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.475
I'm OK.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.910
I'm OK.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.718
Pull up the security feed to Medical.

30:41.200 --> 30:44.192
Can you hear me? What's your name?

30:44.280 --> 30:46.157
No.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.958
No name.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.600
You're wasting your time.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.717
It's Jack Bauer.
What have you got from Henderson?

30:53.800 --> 30:55.916
Nothing. He's still not talking.

30:56.000 --> 31:01.028
OK, keep working on him. As soon as
the barriers go up I'll get back to you.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.839
Chloe, I don't think
we're donna break Henderson.

31:03.920 --> 31:07.071
All we're donna get is from his computer.
Keep working on it.

31:07.160 --> 31:11.870
- My team is gone. How am I donna do that?
- Only work on his files.

31:11.960 --> 31:17.239
Kim. As soon as the barriers go up, I want you
to go to Medical and let them check you out.

31:17.320 --> 31:22.075
- No. When the barriers go up, I'm leaving.
- Please do this for me. We still need to talk.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.196
There's nothing to talk about.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.478
- Don't be in such a hurry to cut me off.
- You cut me off.

31:29.560 --> 31:32.916
Listen to me, I'm not angry. I love you.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.154
But there's nothing left to say,
except I don't want to be around you.

31:39.200 --> 31:43.432
Every time I am,
something horrible happens. People die.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.398
And I know that's not your fault,

31:46.480 --> 31:48.471
but I can't be a part of it.

31:48.560 --> 31:51.791
I don't want you to be a part of that.
All I want is for one day,

31:51.880 --> 31:55.759
you and I just to be able
to spend time together.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.515
Kim, I had to give you up once.
I'm not donna let that happen again.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.715
Dad...

32:14.520 --> 32:15.873
- H i.
- Hey.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.720
God, that was close.

32:32.520 --> 32:35.193
You all right?

32:35.280 --> 32:36.872
No.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.876
"An emergency peacekeeping force."

32:53.960 --> 32:57.430
That was Hal's suggestion. I think it works.

32:57.520 --> 33:00.193
Charles, aren't you afraid
an edict of this kind

33:00.280 --> 33:05.479
could do far more damage
than any chemical weapon ever could?

33:05.560 --> 33:09.314
Martha, CTU has been attacked.
Our first line of defence is shut down.

33:09.400 --> 33:14.428
People were killed because of this weapon.
That's just a prelude to what's donna happen.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.671
More nerve gas will be released.
I can guarantee it.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.957
Look, if you or Mike
have any better ideas, please.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.395
I would be glad to hear them.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.910
- Mike, could we have a moment?
- Certainly.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.155
What is it, Martha?

33:43.800 --> 33:46.997
If you, Charles Logan,

33:47.080 --> 33:52.871
really feel that martial law is
your only option, I will support you.

33:52.960 --> 33:56.316
But what I will not do is stand by

33:56.400 --> 33:59.870
and watch Hal Gardner use you
to promote his own agenda.

33:59.960 --> 34:03.032
- Please, give me some credit.
- He has done it before.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.634
He is not the president. You are.

34:05.720 --> 34:09.349
I'm doing this
because it's the right thing to do.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.717
I don't know
how much more of this I can take.

34:19.679 --> 34:21.909
I really don't.

34:29.280 --> 34:33.478
David's assassination,
the nerve gas, the murder of those hostages,

34:33.560 --> 34:36.279
Walt Cummings' betrayal...

34:37.320 --> 34:39.594
And you.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.350
I almost lost you.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.310
I didn't lose you, did 11tt

34:55.400 --> 34:57.436
No, Charles.

35:02.440 --> 35:05.238
You didn't lose me.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.033
- Yes.
- Weke set in position.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.633
Good.

35:17.720 --> 35:21.156
The men are there. They need the schematics.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.997
Who is it?

35:38.080 --> 35:40.469
Just a client.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.118
- Yes?
- Have you got it yet?

35:44.200 --> 35:48.273
I told you I'd call you as soon as I have
everything. I'm still waiting on a few items.

35:48.360 --> 35:51.352
I'm paying you a lot of money, College.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.357
If you couldest got the
specs of a facility this

35:54.358 --> 35:56.798
secure from someone
else you would have.

35:56.880 --> 36:01.590
But you didn't. You called me,
and I'll have it for you in a few minutes.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.353
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

36:08.440 --> 36:10.396
Difficult client.

36:12.640 --> 36:17.031
I wish I knew exactly what it is you did.
I might be able to help.

36:17.120 --> 36:19.350
You do help me.

36:23.080 --> 36:26.117
I have to go and finish something.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.909
Finis h this.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.478
- How long until the air's safe?
- Momentarily.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.438
All right, thank you very much.

36:41.520 --> 36:42.999
Buchanan.

36:43.080 --> 36:45.719
- Karen Hayes from Homeland Security.
- Karen.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.678
I'm running a damage assessment.
I need your body count.

36:48.760 --> 36:52.799
We don't have one yet. We'll know more
when CRT gets here and the barriers lift.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.075
What's your best estimate?

36:55.160 --> 36:59.472
I'm guessing we'll need at least 20 in Comm,
35 in Tactical and other departments.

36:59.560 --> 37:03.838
I'm on my way over there with a core team.
We can make adjustments when I get there.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.354
- You're coming here now?
- Yes.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.875
- I see.
- I'll be there soon.

37:09.960 --> 37:14.272
- How's your progress?
- Good. I've reformatted their main servers.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.999
All tactical protocols
will have to go through me.

37:17.080 --> 37:20.675
I may have to replace some personnel
with my people. Is that a problem?

37:20.760 --> 37:25.390
Absolutely not. After what they've been
through, most won't be up to full capacity.

37:25.480 --> 37:28.711
We need to identify these people quickly
and send them home.

37:28.800 --> 37:32.509
Will I need approval from Bill Buchanan
to make a personnel change?

37:32.600 --> 37:35.433
No, Bill won't be in charge when we get there.

37:37.320 --> 37:42.348
For all intents and purposes,
CTU is no longer an operational entity.

37:42.440 --> 37:46.433
It's a building with workers
who will report to us.

37:50.840 --> 37:53.559
We're clear. I'm going back to Medical.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.636
Ki m.

37:56.720 --> 37:59.757
- I have to finish this now.
- I know.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.195
Goodbye, Dad.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.109
Yeah.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.716
Goodbye.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.477
Excuse me, Jack.

38:15.040 --> 38:19.158
I just wanted to say thank you
for saving our lives.

38:19.240 --> 38:22.630
We definitely couldn't have
gotten through this without you.

38:22.720 --> 38:28.590
Take her outside of this city.
Don't make any stops. You understand?

38:43.240 --> 38:47.199
- Looks like he's dead.
- No. His nervous system is shut down.

38:47.280 --> 38:50.078
- Well, can you wake him up?
- No.

38:56.560 --> 38:59.836
- Almeida.
- Tony, it's Jack. I'm on my way.

39:00.400 --> 39:04.279
Yeah, Jack. Henderson's in a coma.
He's not coming out of it.

39:04.360 --> 39:06.999
You've had your chance. He's mine now.

39:07.080 --> 39:11.232
- Dammit, Tony, just wait until I get there.
- No. I'm done waiting.

39:11.320 --> 39:13.914
Don't do this. It won't bring back Michelle.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.798
No. But I'll feel better.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.711
Trust me, you wonk.

39:20.760 --> 39:23.479
You're probably right. I'll let you know.

39:23.560 --> 39:24.959
Tony!

39:25.040 --> 39:27.349
Tony! Dammit.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.231
What'd Jack say?

39:30.320 --> 39:34.518
He's on his way here.
We'll figure out what to do when he gets here.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.830
There's nothing to figure out.

39:36.920 --> 39:38.911
This guy's cooked.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.516
Tony! Tony!

40:49.360 --> 40:51.874
I... couldn't do it.

40:51.960 --> 40:55.509
It's all right. It's all right.
Come on. Come on.

40:57.240 --> 41:00.152
Stay with me. Stay with me.

41:00.240 --> 41:03.949
I need help! Somebody help!

41:06.040 --> 41:09.237
No, no. No. Hang on.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.548
Hang on.

41:11.560 --> 41:14.154
She's gone, Jack.

41:15.305 --> 41:21.862
