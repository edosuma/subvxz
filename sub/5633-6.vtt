09:33.874 --> 09:36.207
My entire life

09:36.209 --> 09:39.010

toward these seats.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.275
Hey, you want to fire
a confetti gun, Homer?

10:10.277 --> 10:13.378

of gun I've never fired.

Hi, I'm Gus, and I'll be
happy to serve you.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.338
A friendly bartender?

11:47.340 --> 11:49.507
This is like being
from North Korea

11:49.509 --> 11:51.876
and finding out
there's a South Korea.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.979
Homer, a toast to two
single dads doing their best.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.015
I'm not a single dad.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.150
Well, this will just be
a toast to me, then.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.218
(shouts)

12:00.220 --> 12:02.187
Ooh, whoa!
Are you okay?

12:02.189 --> 12:03.388
Be careful.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.723
I love you.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.491
I'm great!
(laughs)

12:06.493 --> 12:08.493
When I'm happy,
I make holes.

12:08.495 --> 12:11.229
And when I'm sad,
I buy a hockey team.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.997
They cost, like, nothing, man.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.400
And I made $80 million today.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.702
Bam-bam-bam!
(laughs)

12:17.704 --> 12:19.237

Whoo-hoo!

12:23.577 --> 12:25.410
(Homer groaning)

12:25.412 --> 12:27.879
(stammers)
Did I make $80 million?

12:27.881 --> 12:31.015
No, but you made a fool of
the doctor who said you'd die.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.517
Well, he still might!

12:32.519 --> 12:33.685
Not today.

12:33.687 --> 12:36.688
Wow, Mike's daughter
seems really great.

12:36.690 --> 12:37.922
Yeah, but it was weird.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.524
First she was nice to me,

12:39.526 --> 12:42.627
but then when the band came,
she wouldn't let me say a word.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.897
Uh, listen, sweetie.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.899
Let me tell you
a fact of life.

12:47.901 --> 12:51.870
The world is full of wonderful,
priceless experiences,

12:51.872 --> 12:55.106
and I can't give
you any of them.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.941
But this girl can.

12:56.943 --> 13:00.111
So it doesn't matter
if she talks to you,

13:00.113 --> 13:04.082
looks at you, or is
disrespectful to your father.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.585
She is your best friend.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.754
Mm, I don't know.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.122
(phone chimes)

13:11.124 --> 13:15.093
Huh, Harper just invited us
to go see David Copperfield.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.628
Oh, my God!

13:16.630 --> 13:19.464
That's something only
tourists in Vegas get to do!

13:19.466 --> 13:21.132
(dog howls)

13:21.134 --> 13:24.135
Did you ever sit
in the back of anything?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.904
Just the space shuttle, man.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.606
My one regret is
I was too drunk to drive.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.975
(laughs):
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bam!

13:30.977 --> 13:32.577
Bam on that one.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.312
Okay, ladies, would
each of you tell me

13:34.314 --> 13:36.414
your favorite TV
show and dessert.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.616
Certainly. My favorites are
The Happy Little Elves...

13:38.618 --> 13:39.918
Krusty
and cotton candy.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.453
I was gonna say
what my...

13:42.455 --> 13:44.389
Sorry, that's too long
without me talking.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.925
(audience gasps)

13:46.927 --> 13:48.326
So what do I do now?!

13:48.328 --> 13:49.761
Don't worry.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.629
Harper, what's your favorite
starving wild animal?

13:51.631 --> 13:53.698
Crocodile?

13:56.001 --> 13:58.069
What's the trick here?!
(snarling)

13:58.771 --> 14:00.605
I'm so happy.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.841
(sighs) Marge, do you know
what it's like

14:02.843 --> 14:06.444
to have a man take care
of your every need?

14:06.446 --> 14:09.514
I've thought about it a lot,
but no.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.782
How come you're so quiet?

14:10.784 --> 14:12.483
Did he switch your brain
with a rabbit's?

14:12.485 --> 14:15.186
'Cause that means somewhere
there is one annoying rabbit.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.688
Shut up.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.490
I just keep thinking about
the way Harper cut me off.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.192
It's kind of weird.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.795
Yeah, that was
kind of weird.

14:23.797 --> 14:25.163
I'd have said
something for sure,

14:25.165 --> 14:26.698
but my mouth was full
of truffle popcorn.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.699
(phone chimes)

14:27.701 --> 14:28.867
(gasps)

14:28.869 --> 14:30.635
Mike just invited our family

14:30.637 --> 14:33.538
to spend next week
on their private island!

14:33.540 --> 14:35.640
Wow, a whole week.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.141
Too bad the kids
have school.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.810
Marge, please.

14:38.812 --> 14:42.513
Lisa's not gonna fall behind
and Bart's not gonna catch up.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.849
We do not want
our kids spoiled.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.718
(groans)
Yeah, okay.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.587
Maybe this is where
this thing should stop.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.161

14:57.163 --> 14:58.529
Hello?

14:58.531 --> 15:00.064
This is Principal
Seymour Skinner.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.200
We're calling parents,
starting with you,

15:02.202 --> 15:05.069
to let them know that school
has been canceled next week.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.373
Hmm. Did that rich dad
buy you off?

15:08.375 --> 15:09.674

15:09.676 --> 15:12.644
Seymour Skinner is not for sale.

are coming with us.

a friendship present.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.108
Okay, what's the story?

15:44.110 --> 15:45.743
This we show up for.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.613
Harper, this bike is wonderful.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.248
Too wonderful.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.051
It just wouldn't be right
for me to accept it.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.219
You'd rather have
your crappy bike?

15:55.221 --> 15:58.723
Look, Harper, this may be
crappy, but it's my bike.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.459
My dad assembled it
on Christmas day.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.429

backwards to go forwards.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.230

Uh, I didn't realize
getting you the best bike

16:08.735 --> 16:11.269
you ever saw
would make you so mad.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.104
I'm not mad,
I just think this is...

16:13.106 --> 16:14.305
Just what?

16:14.307 --> 16:15.974
Don't appreciate
what I did for you?

16:15.976 --> 16:18.309
Why do you always
interrupt me like that?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.144

Uh, I think
I know how friends are.

Harper flipped a sea
turtle on its back!

19:38.811 --> 19:40.678
My beach,
my turtle!

19:40.680 --> 19:42.647
Why is everything
yours?!

19:42.649 --> 19:45.683
Oh, why do you kids
have to argue all the time?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.785
'Cause she wants
things her way

19:47.787 --> 19:49.854
instead of
the right way.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.024
Homer, help me out here.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.659
No, no, with the girls.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.795
Just tell your kid to let
my kid have her way this time.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.163
And every other time.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.698
(crying):
Dad...

20:00.700 --> 20:03.434
I think you have a
choice to make here.

20:10.642 --> 20:11.809
(sighs)

20:11.811 --> 20:14.445
It's time I stood up
for myself.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.814
(whirring)

20:16.816 --> 20:19.650
Harper, I know I shouldn't say
this on your private island,

20:19.652 --> 20:21.986
but you're
kind of spoiled.

20:21.988 --> 20:22.820
(both gasp)

20:22.822 --> 20:23.988
That's right.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.690
You don't deserve Lisa.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.825
There's nothing I
love more than her.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.161
She's the sun, the moon
and the other thing to me.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.063
(gasps)
Thank you.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.031
And we don't have to
be on the same island

20:34.033 --> 20:35.666
with people who push
my little girl around.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.867
Let's go, Marge.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.237
Now? I just got up.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.404
Now, please!

20:40.406 --> 20:41.739
If you leave this island,

20:41.741 --> 20:43.040
you're not taking the yacht.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.075
Oh, no.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.010
You're taking a limo
to a private jet,

20:46.012 --> 20:48.012
which is flying you
straight home!

20:48.014 --> 20:51.082
Then so be it. Hmph.

20:52.851 --> 20:54.919
(grunting)

20:57.089 --> 21:00.691
I know how you
feel, buddy.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.693
Oh, I better sit down.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.095
Where can I sit?

21:09.434 --> 21:12.370
Dad, what you said
was really nice.

21:12.372 --> 21:16.107
And believe me, we're much
better off, off that island.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.875
I know.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.877
Good-bye, crystal-clear lagoon.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.780
Good riddance, pink sand beach.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.082
Good-bye, swim-up movie theater

21:25.084 --> 21:27.952
that was going to show
Back to the Future.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.787
Good-bye, sweet liquors

21:29.789 --> 21:32.590
that didn't let Marge
know I was drunk.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.758
Good-bye, snorkeling

21:33.760 --> 21:35.593
and Jet-Skiing

21:35.595 --> 21:38.763
and other things I never tried.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.298
Good-bye, obese natives

21:40.300 --> 21:42.566
that made me feel fit.

21:42.568 --> 21:45.136
Good-bye, Bart. Bart?!

21:45.138 --> 21:47.204
(laughing)

21:47.973 --> 21:50.007
Shh!

21:52.978 --> 21:55.012
