WEBVTT

00:03.546 --> 00:05.381
Ah, for shit's sake, you again?

00:05.464 --> 00:06.799
Really, you forgot what
happened on

00:06.882 --> 00:08.926
last week's episode?
It was seven days ago.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.845
Drop the drink and get yourself
to a fucking meeting,

00:10.928 --> 00:12.555
you loser.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.057
I'm busting my ass to get you
out of this shit hole.

00:15.141 --> 00:17.309
My work here's not done.

00:17.393 --> 00:19.061
I-I need a few more days.

00:19.145 --> 00:20.730
<i>You don't think
I should bail him out?</i>

00:20.813 --> 00:22.356
If he skips town,
you lose all your money.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.524
Could be put to better use.

00:23.607 --> 00:24.942
- How?
- I don't know.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.360
Invest in another
apartment building.

00:26.444 --> 00:29.155
Buy a café, yoga studio.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.198
Why don't you come stay with me
for a couple of days?

00:31.282 --> 00:32.366
That'd be cool.

00:32.450 --> 00:33.492
<i>You spend all your
time hanging out with that</i>

00:33.576 --> 00:34.577
<i>10-year-old girl.</i>

00:34.660 --> 00:35.661
She doesn't have anybody else.

00:35.745 --> 00:36.996
Call DCFS, bro.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.372
Shit ain't your problem.

00:38.456 --> 00:40.583
Eighteen dollars?
I make fifteen.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.877
Well, you're a girl.
Way of the world, Jugs

00:42.960 --> 00:44.545
V, why they got
so much energy now?

00:44.628 --> 00:45.629
Go get it.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.214
So well-behaved.

00:47.298 --> 00:49.258
Pre-school.

00:49.341 --> 00:52.219
What are your plans for after
graduation, Corporal?

00:52.303 --> 00:53.304
Sir?

00:53.387 --> 00:54.764
Cadet lieutenants have
traditionally gone on

00:54.847 --> 00:55.848
to service academies.

00:55.931 --> 00:56.849
West Point?

00:56.932 --> 00:59.393
Get a congressman
or senator's recommendation.

00:59.477 --> 01:00.811
You really think I could, Sir?

01:00.895 --> 01:02.396
There's an epidemic
at our school.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.106
Four people
have tested positive

01:04.190 --> 01:06.776
for virulent strains
of multiple STDs.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.236
- I slept with Frank.
- So did I.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.073
- I slept with Frank.
- Frank.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.938
Good morning,
my day-drinking brethren.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.482
- How's everyone this morning?
- We were good.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.860
You smell like actual shit,
Frank.

02:30.943 --> 02:34.113
Uh, rye whiskey, V.
Leave the bottle.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.157
Can't pay with cans, Frank.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.576
Why not? There's gotta be
20 bucks in there.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.328
And that's our recycling.

02:41.412 --> 02:42.746
I just put those out.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.541
Right, and now
I'm recycling them.

02:45.624 --> 02:46.709
No.

02:46.792 --> 02:50.045
Uh, run a tab?
For old times' sake?

02:56.677 --> 03:00.389
Oh, damn, I just peed
myself a little.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.475
Guys, can you spot me?

03:03.559 --> 03:05.519
We fucking hate you, Frank.

03:08.147 --> 03:09.481
V.

03:11.692 --> 03:15.196
Can I have the keg tray?
At least let me drink that.

03:15.279 --> 03:18.574
You wanna slurp warm, day-old
beer runoff from a keg tray?

03:18.657 --> 03:20.618
Wow, lowering the bar, Frank.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.785
- Disgusting, Frank.
- Every day.

03:21.869 --> 03:25.331
When options are few,
the wise man adapts.

03:25.414 --> 03:28.209
Fine. One pity beer.
One.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.377
You tight on cash,
huh, Frank?

03:30.461 --> 03:33.172
Tighter than a Mormon virgin.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.049
I know how you can make
some quick dough,

03:35.132 --> 03:36.383
if you're interested.

03:36.467 --> 03:38.510
I don't do blowies anymore,
Hughie.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.387
This lady's paying five bucks

03:40.471 --> 03:43.390
for every "Ruiz for Congress"
sign you steal from a yard.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.059
You bring the signs
over to the alley

03:45.142 --> 03:47.937
behind Wyman's headquarters,
she gives you cash.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.897
For stolen signs?
What's the catch?

03:50.648 --> 03:51.815
Just get paid to steal.

03:53.484 --> 03:56.237
All right, thanks.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.326
What's with the uniform,
GI Joe?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.702
I thought you were off
for the summer.

04:03.786 --> 04:05.537
Yeah, aren't you supposed
to be "at rest"?

04:05.621 --> 04:07.581
At ease.
And there is no ease

04:07.665 --> 04:09.917
for a soldier
who's West Point bound.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.418
Debs, can you pass me the milk?

04:11.502 --> 04:12.795
Debs.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.005
Eighty cents.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.299
That's how much women make
on the dollar compared to men.

04:17.383 --> 04:19.718
And if you're a woman
of color, 65 cents.

04:19.802 --> 04:22.179
This is a sexist
shit nugget of a country.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.473
- Don't you forget that.
- Oh, Debs!

04:24.556 --> 04:26.976
Thank God you're not working.
Hey, I need a favor.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.561
I gotta take V to
this nursery school tour.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.146
Can you watch the girls
for like an hour?

04:31.230 --> 04:32.523
They can't come.
Thanks.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.774
Why are you speaking to me?

04:34.358 --> 04:35.985
- 'Cause you're Debbie.
- No.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.988
Why are you speaking
to the only woman in the room,

04:39.071 --> 04:40.447
Kevin Ball?

04:40.531 --> 04:41.865
Why is childcare
a woman's job?

04:41.949 --> 04:43.158
Let me tell you why.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.244
Did you know that
the average American man

04:45.327 --> 04:48.956
works about 17.5 hours a week
doing unpaid home labor?

04:49.039 --> 04:51.458
Cooking, cleaning.
While women, however,

04:51.542 --> 04:54.086
spend about 28.4 hours a week.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.796
Now, considering the
fact that the average American

04:55.879 --> 04:59.258
makes $26.82 an hour,
that's $40,000 a year

04:59.341 --> 05:00.718
that women are not getting paid

05:00.801 --> 05:03.053
to cook, clean,
and wipe baby asses.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.390
So you can't do it?

05:07.016 --> 05:10.311
Come on, Franny, let's oppose
patriarchal oppression.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.146
Yeah!

05:13.564 --> 05:16.025
Lip, just an hour, man.
Please.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.109
- No.
- Just one hour.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.986
I can't. I would. I gotta head
to a meeting before work.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.905
- I'm sorry.
- Carl! My man.

05:21.989 --> 05:25.492
Yeah, sorry, I got a parley
with a superior at 0900.

05:27.036 --> 05:29.747
I can do it.
I don't have school.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.708
Amazing!
Thank you so much.

05:32.791 --> 05:33.959
Here's their diaper bag.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.421
Who are you, again?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.590
This is Xan, she's staying
with us for a while.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.800
Are you sure? I mean,
that's really nice of you.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.386
- You're paying, right?
- Bless you, Xanadu.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.305
- You're good? Sure?
- Yeah.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.931
- All right.
- I gotta get going.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.266
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, Lip,

05:49.350 --> 05:50.351
I'm already late for school.
Take me?

05:50.434 --> 05:51.894
Yeah, I got you.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.520
Oh, Hi!

05:53.604 --> 05:55.189
There you go, Bud.
Hey, Xan, text me, all right?

05:55.272 --> 05:56.857
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:03.447 --> 06:04.990
Mm.

06:09.161 --> 06:11.872
Hey.
You know Max Whitford?

06:14.666 --> 06:16.126
The guy from the bus benches?

06:16.210 --> 06:18.087
Yeah, he's the number one
commercial real estate agent

06:18.170 --> 06:19.213
in Chicago.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.048
So says bench boy.

06:21.632 --> 06:24.385
He sold Miles that place
over on 26th street. Why?

06:24.468 --> 06:26.303
I got a meeting with him today.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.347
I'm gonna start looking
at commercial properties.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.808
Ian's bail money is
burning a hole in my pocket,

06:30.891 --> 06:33.977
so I'm gonna spend my equity
on buying another property.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.482
Commercial real estate?

06:38.565 --> 06:41.068
Yeah, you were the one
who told me to invest.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.445
I meant maybe buy another
building, some apartments.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.322
Those things are mini-malls.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.827
And mini-malls
are out of my league?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.079
Max Whitford's just gonna
try and fuck you, trust me.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.957
Well, I can handle men
trying to fuck me.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.667
I've been doing that
since I was nine.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.294
Commercial real estate
carries more risk.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.840
I did pretty great flipping
that laundromat.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.217
I just don't think
it's for you.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.305
Who's it for then?

07:11.515 --> 07:12.891
It's for people who were
born on third base

07:12.975 --> 07:14.143
and think they hit a triple.

07:14.226 --> 07:17.062
Oh, so I have to be an
un-fuckable trust fund baby

07:17.146 --> 07:19.481
to get anywhere in life,
that's what you're saying?

07:19.565 --> 07:20.858
You know what?
Forget it.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.443
Don't worry about it.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.529
I turned a profit on not one,
but two properties.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.947
I know you did.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.033
- And you'll do great.
- Mm-hmm.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.382
So what are you guys in for?

07:45.466 --> 07:48.343
Stole a first grader's
Black Amex.

07:48.427 --> 07:51.054
Didn't share
my breakfast sushi.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.973
Cool.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.142
Liam, come in, please.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.777
Are you familiar
with the saying

08:07.821 --> 08:09.615
Think I've heard it at home.

08:09.698 --> 08:14.203
Your father made a lot
of Hopkins parents very...

08:14.286 --> 08:17.915
unhappy,
and where there's unhappiness,

08:17.998 --> 08:21.210
there's often anger
and retribution.

08:21.293 --> 08:24.463
The Committee for Diversity
and Advancement

08:24.546 --> 08:27.674
who fund your scholarship,
they have made some demands

08:27.758 --> 08:30.135
and, well,

08:30.844 --> 08:32.971
we've loved having you here,
son.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.641
Why are you speaking
in past tense?

08:35.724 --> 08:38.393
We see this as
an opportunity for you.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.270
With the step up that
we have given you,

08:40.354 --> 08:42.606
you can soar now, little bird.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.816
I'm getting kicked out?

08:45.484 --> 08:46.610
Yeah.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.745
Are you lost, honey?

08:58.622 --> 09:00.541
Cadet Lieutenant
Carl Gallagher.

09:00.624 --> 09:02.376
I'm here to see
Congressman Ubberman, ma'am.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.627
Why?

09:03.710 --> 09:06.463
I seek the honor of his
recommendation for West Point.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.215
Are you a constituent?

09:08.298 --> 09:09.341
Ma'am?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.093
You live around here?

09:12.678 --> 09:15.389
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll tell you how this works.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.015
First, you set up
an appointment,

09:17.099 --> 09:20.644
and the first avail we have
is in nine weeks.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.689
And you come back with your
transcripts and your vitae--

09:23.772 --> 09:25.107
My what?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.901
Your athletic and your
academic achievements.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.320
You know, publications, awards,

09:30.404 --> 09:31.989
and your exceptional record

09:32.072 --> 09:33.282
of your volunteer work
in this community.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.908
Volunteer work?

09:34.992 --> 09:36.910
You have to work for free
to get into West Point?

09:36.994 --> 09:38.787
Thought you just had to wanna
kill some towel heads.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.248
The 100 hours of community
service I did

09:41.331 --> 09:42.332
after juvie count?

09:42.791 --> 09:43.959
Court-ordered?

09:44.626 --> 09:46.837
No.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.422
Here is a list of our

09:48.505 --> 09:51.550
accredited volunteer
organizations.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.176
Maybe start there.

09:54.303 --> 09:55.846
Any of them pay?

10:00.309 --> 10:03.645
When we speak of marriage,
what do we speak of?

10:04.688 --> 10:07.065
Well, you could
turn to the Bible,

10:07.149 --> 10:08.942
see what they have to say.

10:09.026 --> 10:12.696
We could try Ephesians 5:25.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.032
"For a man shall love his wife

10:15.115 --> 10:16.867
the way Christ
loved the church.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.536
He gave up his life for her."

10:19.620 --> 10:22.414
But that's not very
applicable to us, is it?

10:22.497 --> 10:25.250
Well, when I see these

10:25.334 --> 10:28.670
beautiful couples
standing before me today,

10:28.754 --> 10:31.089
living under the terms of our
newly-negotiated deal,

10:31.173 --> 10:35.135
one of mutual consent
and reduced aggression,

10:35.218 --> 10:40.057
I see a true union, a union
that defies categorization.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.059
So, Bob and Hobart,

10:42.142 --> 10:44.269
Sameer and EJ,

10:44.353 --> 10:45.979
Gary and Turkish,

10:46.063 --> 10:47.522
do you come to
this courtyard today

10:47.606 --> 10:49.608
purely to exchange vows?

10:49.691 --> 10:50.942
I do.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.819
Let's start with you,
Bob and Hobart.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.196
Gallagher.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.365
You made bail.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.576
- What?
- You're out of here.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.036
No, there's been
a mistake, all right?

11:01.119 --> 11:02.829
I'm in the middle of vows.
My work here is not done.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.498
- I am not leaving.
- Move it, come on, come on.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.375
- No.
- Don't touch Father Gallagher!

11:06.458 --> 11:07.918
We protect him.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.003
Let him finish!

11:10.087 --> 11:11.713
I don't wanna go!

11:11.797 --> 11:13.757
So wait, are they
married or not?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.467
Say they're married, Gallagher.

11:15.550 --> 11:18.261
By the power vested in me

11:18.345 --> 11:21.181
and the great
state of Illinois...

11:21.264 --> 11:22.641
Crazy.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.441
Girls are still doing that
screechy dog thing, huh?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.318
Whee.

11:33.402 --> 11:36.113
Look, Zehra,
it's Gemma and Amy.

11:37.406 --> 11:40.242
Oh, I think she's still
a little afraid of them.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.577
You their new sitter?

11:42.661 --> 11:44.037
Yeah.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.748
Yeah, baby,
we can do the slide.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.626
Nice to meet you.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.678
What're you doing
with my wallet?

12:00.470 --> 12:02.055
Are you stealing from me?

12:02.139 --> 12:03.807
Uh, n--no.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.268
Hey! Give me my wallet back!

12:07.936 --> 12:09.438
What the hell are you doing?
You can't just leave

12:09.521 --> 12:11.273
the girls here.

12:11.356 --> 12:15.861
<i>♪♪ I love my leather
more than ever before ♪♪</i>

12:15.944 --> 12:19.489
<i>♪♪ I picked it up off
some beauty queen's floor ♪♪</i>

12:19.573 --> 12:20.949
What do you think
you're doing?

12:21.032 --> 12:22.993
No, these are,
uh, defective.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.663
The signs are defective, and,
uh, they've ordered a recall,

12:26.747 --> 12:28.832
the FDA.
The ink

12:28.915 --> 12:31.084
was, um, choking hazard,

12:31.168 --> 12:33.211
so they're going to
be returned.

12:33.295 --> 12:36.047
That's my sign, asshole!

12:36.131 --> 12:38.091
No, I--I'm gonna
bring them back.

12:38.175 --> 12:40.093
- Yeah, sure, you will.
- I'll return them.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.681
So, how old are
your princesses?

12:44.765 --> 12:46.057
Uh, four years old.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.477
Well, our program
has thrice been awarded

12:48.560 --> 12:51.938
the Stamp of Excellence by
<i>Good Parenting</i> magazine.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.148
Follow me this way.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.405
Holy shit,
are those bunnies real?

13:00.489 --> 13:02.032
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

13:02.115 --> 13:05.285
Each child gets his or her own
bunny at Beaucoup.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.829
We try to surround the children
with soft textures,

13:07.913 --> 13:08.830
like in the womb.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.999
Oh. Wombs are soft.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.255
Very good, Clover.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.383
I think you are
a future surgeon too.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.886
I'm proud of you.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.473
Mandarin Immersion today.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.936
So what do you think?

13:31.019 --> 13:33.396
This is where I wanna go
when I die.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.650
Here is our applications packet

13:36.733 --> 13:39.528
with beaucoup info
about Beaucoup.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.821
What's this, uh,
number here?

13:40.904 --> 13:42.864
Is that a year in the future?

13:42.948 --> 13:44.574
No, that's our tuition.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.035
- For a year?
- For the month.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.286
For a month?

13:48.370 --> 13:50.372
Uh, that's three times
our mortgage.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.250
Oh, dear.
Yes, these numbers can seem

13:53.333 --> 13:54.876
a little bit high,

13:54.960 --> 13:58.380
but it's
pretty standard in Chicago.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.881
Are there scholarships?

13:59.965 --> 14:01.508
Not at Beaucoup.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.552
Why don't
I recommend you somewhere

14:03.635 --> 14:06.680
that's a little more
budget-friendly.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.807
Okay?

14:19.025 --> 14:22.237
Hello, everyone!
My name is Debbie Gallagher,

14:22.320 --> 14:24.739
and I am a proud welder
with a vagina,

14:24.823 --> 14:27.576
and I will stand for
the wage gap no longer.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.453
I am here to look for strong,
independent women

14:30.537 --> 14:32.831
who will stand up with me
and say no.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.416
We need equal pay.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.251
We need to unite, ladies.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.795
We need to stick together,
ladies.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.881
We...

14:40.964 --> 14:43.300
Uh, excuse me, sir, where are
all the female employees?

14:43.967 --> 14:45.385
Buying pantsuits.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.304
- At the women's march.
- Sewing pussy hats.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.430
Leanin' in!

14:48.513 --> 14:49.681
I wish they'd lean over.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.183
Nice, nice, misogynistic dick.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.813
All right, um,

14:57.939 --> 14:59.733
so my name's Jason,

15:00.734 --> 15:04.321
and... I'm an alcoholic
and an addict.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.072
- Hey, Jason.
- Hi, Jason.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.657
Sorry for having
a kid with me.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.702
I didn't have anywhere else
to take her.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.079
Her mom got busted
six days ago.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.998
And I keep trying to take her
to a shelter,

15:15.081 --> 15:17.334
but shelters don't let men
with babies in,

15:17.417 --> 15:18.752
so,

15:19.336 --> 15:21.212
a lot of hard nights
in the car.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.674
Uh, I was sober four days
last week.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.552
Blew it two days ago.
Blacked out.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.512
Woke up to her screaming.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.516
What I really want
is a fucking hit.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.186
But I came here, so...

15:36.269 --> 15:38.104
Thanks for sharing,
Jason.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.648
Anyone else?

15:40.649 --> 15:42.943
Okay,
that's our time for today.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.403
All right, see ya.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.949
Wanna hit Patsy's
for pie before work?

15:49.866 --> 15:51.701
It's kind of early
for pie, no?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.370
It's never too early.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.996
Besides,
they have breakfast pie.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.289
It's called "apple."

15:59.960 --> 16:02.045
Hey, uh, thanks for your share,
man.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.630
Was it okay?

16:04.339 --> 16:06.508
I--I mean, it's weird telling
everybody your shit.

16:06.591 --> 16:09.427
Yeah, no, you did good.
Just, uh, keep coming back.

16:09.511 --> 16:12.097
Hey, actually,
can I ask you something?

16:12.180 --> 16:13.932
Uh, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.393
I don't know how this is
supposed to go. I--

16:16.476 --> 16:19.479
Feels like I'm asking you out
on a date or something.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.564
I need a sponsor.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.233
Wondering if you--

16:23.316 --> 16:24.943
you'd be up to sponsoring me.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.403
Me?

16:26.486 --> 16:29.531
No, man, I'm--I'm the last guy
you'd want to sponsor you.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.199
But, uh,

16:31.282 --> 16:33.034
you know, maybe ask Marshall.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.452
The guy with the walker?

16:34.536 --> 16:35.996
Yeah.

16:36.079 --> 16:39.249
I need somebody
born after 1990.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.127
I mean, these people are
all fucking dinosaurs.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.420
No offense.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.672
None taken, shithead.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.424
I feel like I could
talk to you.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.678
Yeah, let me think about it,
all right?

17:03.398 --> 17:05.150
What?

17:05.233 --> 17:07.110
Let me think about it?

17:09.362 --> 17:12.741
It's unity, service,
and recovery, man.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.285
Service.
That guy needs you.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.828
I got enough people
that need me.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.538
Boo-hoo-hoo.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.582
You're loved and in demand.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.543
Excuse me.

17:23.793 --> 17:24.794
Hello?

17:26.337 --> 17:27.338
Yeah.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.801
Shit, okay.
Yeah, I'll be right there.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.345
All right.
Yeah, I'll catch you later!

17:37.182 --> 17:38.683
So Congressman
Ubberman's office

17:38.767 --> 17:41.352
sent you over?
Where's that form?

17:41.436 --> 17:43.021
Oh.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.065
Couple of routine questions.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.941
Why do you wanna be a mentor?

17:47.025 --> 17:48.485
I don't.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.696
Then, why are you here?

17:51.780 --> 17:54.032
I have to volunteer somewhere.

17:55.241 --> 17:59.037
What academic subjects could
you tutor your mentee in?

18:00.955 --> 18:02.290
None.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.334
Special skills?

18:04.417 --> 18:05.794
Steady hand with a knife,
ma'am.

18:05.877 --> 18:08.171
Like to cut things
and watch 'em bleed.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.510
I think I might know
a place for you,

18:13.593 --> 18:16.262
and...
I guarantee you

18:16.346 --> 18:20.100
they are in desperate need
of volunteers.

18:20.183 --> 18:21.726
Here.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.272
Soothing Horizon?

18:26.356 --> 18:28.358
Sounds like a nail salon.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.818
It's not.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.324
Hi, I'm here, but I'm not here.
I'm super late.

18:36.407 --> 18:38.368
- I just need shoes.
- Okay.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.125
Hey, whose shit
is this in my closet?

18:45.208 --> 18:46.751
Mine.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.212
What'd you do
with that box of shoes?

18:49.295 --> 18:51.923
I need those red heels
for my meeting.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.093
Oh, yeah, Gallaghers,
that's great,

18:55.176 --> 18:59.597
just ram 'em under the stairs
under some wet, moldy towels.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.474
Thank you very much.

19:03.184 --> 19:04.686
Why aren't you in school?

19:04.769 --> 19:05.854
I got expelled.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.106
Why?

19:08.189 --> 19:09.315
Frank.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.151
What did he do?

19:11.693 --> 19:13.153
All the moms.

19:13.236 --> 19:15.155
He gave them venereal diseases.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.782
And they kicked you out?

19:24.789 --> 19:26.416
Get in my car now.
Come on.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.293
- Ugh, okay.
- Come on.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.140
<i>♪♪ What makes a man?

19:42.223 --> 19:43.308

19:43.391 --> 19:44.475
- Oh.
- Hey.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.436
Sorry, just surprised.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.771
We don't see a lot of your type
collecting signs.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.273
How many you got there?

19:50.356 --> 19:52.734
Twenty-two.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.695
Nice gig you got here,
fencing signs.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.572
I'm the campaign manager.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.073
Jesus.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.159
How do I become
a campaign manager?

20:01.242 --> 20:03.161
Hard to break in.
Lot of hustle.

20:03.244 --> 20:06.706
Took me a decade of policy law,
and an MBA from Yale.

20:06.789 --> 20:07.999
Here you go.

20:08.082 --> 20:11.461
One ten, plus an extra ten
bucks for your discretion.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.671
I could be a lot
more discreet for 20.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.507
It's the going rate for
nondisclosure

20:16.591 --> 20:18.218
on the South Side.

20:18.301 --> 20:19.844
Okay.
Here.

20:19.928 --> 20:21.179
Thanks again.

20:21.262 --> 20:23.431
Well, wait, what blocks
still have signs?

20:23.514 --> 20:25.350
I could have another 50
by end of business.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.728
Oh, we'd rather give the work
to the diversity hires.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.605
You understand.

20:30.688 --> 20:31.606
Vote Wyman!

20:42.158 --> 20:45.578
Yo, Kev, I'm so sorry, man.
Hey, you girls all right?

20:45.662 --> 20:46.746
They're all right.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.039
Hi, hey, ma'am.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.916
Are you the one responsible
for that little hood rat

20:49.999 --> 20:51.000
who stole my wallet?

20:51.084 --> 20:52.669
Yeah, look,
I--I'm so sorry about that.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.754
Um, how much did she take?
I--I can pay you back.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.005
She took
the whole damn wallet.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.050
Eighty bucks, my ID,
my credit cards.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.593
Okay, all right,
we can take care of that.

21:00.677 --> 21:04.180
Uh, here you go, there's 80,
and, uh, I'll find it for you.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.306
I'll get it back to you,
all right?

21:05.390 --> 21:07.684
I promise.
Um...

21:09.435 --> 21:11.729
Hey, did you see which way
the--the girl went or...

21:11.813 --> 21:13.523
Not my problem.
Tell that girl

21:13.606 --> 21:16.651
if I see her in the park again,
I'm calling the cops.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.698
What about Briar Lane Academy?

21:21.781 --> 21:24.409
- Mm, where's that one?
- Skokie.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.244
How're you gonna get up there
every day?

21:26.327 --> 21:28.246
Those schools are for kids
with nannies and drivers.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.665
You gotta find a school
way closer to home.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.250
Or just go to Dyett.

21:32.333 --> 21:33.876
I can't go to public school.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.004
- Why not?
- Hopkins made me soft.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.673
I have manners now.
I eat paté.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.466
I put apricot oil
on my cuticles.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.218
Well, there's three weeks
of school left,

21:42.302 --> 21:43.803
and you gotta go somewhere.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.015
Max Whitford says
he's gonna be late.

21:47.098 --> 21:48.308
Classic power move.

21:48.391 --> 21:51.644
Can't we just see if
Briar Lane Academy has a spot?

21:51.728 --> 21:53.730
Maybe they provide
transportation?

21:53.813 --> 21:56.107
Fine, here,
put the number in.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.112
<i>Admissions.</i>

22:01.195 --> 22:02.864
Hi, there, I was calling to see

22:02.947 --> 22:04.699
whether you might have room
in your--

22:04.782 --> 22:06.367
<i>Ethnicity of the student?</i>

22:08.077 --> 22:09.078
Black.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.788
<i>Sorry, we already have one.</i>

22:10.872 --> 22:12.332
One what?

22:12.415 --> 22:14.334
<i>Black student.
Thanks for calling.</i>

22:17.378 --> 22:20.048
Sorry.

22:20.131 --> 22:21.883
I'll take you over
to public school tomorrow.

22:21.966 --> 22:24.927
But today I have to impress
this Whitford guy.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.138
Real estate agents always
have something better

22:27.221 --> 22:28.890
than whatever it is
they're showing you.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.809
You just have to convince them
that you deserve to see it.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.728
He's also got fiduciary duty.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.981
We covered that in Ethics.
And if you wanna impress him,

22:37.065 --> 22:39.359
use the word "artisanal" a lot.

22:39.442 --> 22:41.152
It's how fancy people say good.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.613
Artisanal cheese.
Artisanal soap.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.031
Wow, where did you learn
all this?

22:45.114 --> 22:47.033
Artisanal private school.

22:47.617 --> 22:48.951
Artisanal.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.293
Can I help you, sir?

22:57.377 --> 23:00.004
Yeah, I--I need to speak
to the campaign manager.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.923
It's a--it's
a matter of some urgency.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.926
He's at a fundraiser, but I'm
the operations manager, Diego.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.220
All right,
Operations Manager Diego,

23:07.303 --> 23:10.014
are you aware there are
two whole city blocks

23:10.098 --> 23:11.599
with no Ruiz signs on them?

23:11.682 --> 23:13.518
Oh, I know, it's a problem.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.311
Crooked Eleanor Wyman
pays the homeless to do it.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.647
- I mean, it's deplorable.
- It's despicable.

23:17.730 --> 23:18.981
She's evil.

23:19.065 --> 23:22.693
Well, luckily, I have, uh, some
experience in erecting signs.

23:22.777 --> 23:24.821
Maybe I could go around
and replace them for you.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.531
- What do you guys pay?
- Five bucks a sign.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.241
But, um, we try to hire
local people.

23:28.324 --> 23:32.120
Hey, I'm as local as they come.
South Side, born and bred.

23:32.203 --> 23:34.205
Uh, local Hispanic people.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.457
I am Hispanic.
Frank Rodriguez.

23:36.541 --> 23:37.750
- Rodriguez?
- Yeah.

23:37.834 --> 23:40.336
My dad was, uh, Irish,
but, uh,

23:40.420 --> 23:42.296
mamacita was Mexican.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.173
I'm a big, fat chimichanga.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.467
Hey, I'm gonna
take 22 of these.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.344
Do you guys pay in advance?

23:48.428 --> 23:49.929
You're gonna have to meet us at
the debate afterwards

23:50.012 --> 23:51.639
to get paid.
That's where Alejandro,

23:51.722 --> 23:53.307
the campaign manager, is.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.810
All righty, then.

23:55.893 --> 23:57.270
Got it.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.272
- Go Wyman!
- You mean Ruiz.

23:59.355 --> 24:00.731
What?

24:00.815 --> 24:02.066
Go Ruiz.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.402
Right.
<i>Arriba, arriba.</i>

24:12.493 --> 24:14.036
Ian.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.788
Ian, oh, my God.

24:18.249 --> 24:21.294
Oh, my God.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.881
Oh, my God, can you believe it?

24:24.964 --> 24:27.091
We raised every dime ourselves.

24:27.175 --> 24:29.010
- We?
- Your disciples.

24:29.093 --> 24:31.220
We crowdsourced your bail
to get you out.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.305
I wasn't really done in there,
though.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.806
Those guys need me.

24:33.890 --> 24:36.309
Oh, my God, so much exciting
stuff has happened.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.394
We have sponsorship now.

24:38.478 --> 24:41.814
We're in 45 states,
1 mil strong on Insta.

24:41.898 --> 24:44.192
We're getting some of those
conversion facilities

24:44.275 --> 24:45.943
closed down.
Got money

24:46.027 --> 24:47.987
and pro bono lawyers
working on it.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.907
Got you a defense attorney.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.284
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm talking so fast.

24:53.367 --> 24:54.911
I'm just...

24:54.994 --> 24:56.537
I'm really happy to see you.

24:59.373 --> 25:00.500
You ready to face your public?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.128
Come on.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.796
Come on!

25:05.880 --> 25:07.548
They've been waiting for hours.

25:08.591 --> 25:11.010
Here he is.
Gay Jesus!

25:21.479 --> 25:24.524
My name is Debbie Gallagher and
I am a welder with a vagina,

25:24.607 --> 25:26.651
and I am here to stand up
to patriarchy!

25:26.734 --> 25:29.362
I am looking for any and all
female employees...

25:29.445 --> 25:31.405
- Show us your pussy!
- To stand up with me,

25:31.489 --> 25:32.949
and say no!

25:33.032 --> 25:34.158
We need to stick
together, ladies.

25:34.242 --> 25:35.952
- Sup, double Ds?
- We will not be silent!

25:36.035 --> 25:38.788
Ow, you fucking dickhead.
You almost hit my kid.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.123
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, yo,
lady, you gotta go.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.292
- You distracting my men.
- They're a bunch of pig fucks.

25:43.376 --> 25:45.086
We see boobs!

25:45.169 --> 25:46.587
I am not leaving
until I get to speak

25:46.671 --> 25:47.880
to one of your
female employees.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.048
There aren't any.

25:49.131 --> 25:50.466
You don't have
one female employee?

25:50.550 --> 25:51.884
No.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.179
So get your smelly cunt
out of here.

26:01.978 --> 26:04.897
Yeah, well, I just think
it's a little tacky

26:04.981 --> 26:07.900
to be doing business
at a funeral, David.

26:07.984 --> 26:09.485
All right, well,
you can tell him to come back

26:09.569 --> 26:11.237
with 740 firm
or he can go fuck himself.

26:11.779 --> 26:12.989
Right.

26:13.072 --> 26:16.242
Sorry about that,
I'm just slammed today.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.662
What can I say?
Abundance, it's a real thing.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.122
So, what do you think?

26:21.205 --> 26:23.416
It's got good bones, but I'm
really looking for

26:23.499 --> 26:28.045
something more upscale.
More, uh, artisanal.

26:28.129 --> 26:31.132
Uh, I see.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.177
I think we know
someone in common.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.304
Ford Kellogg?

26:36.387 --> 26:38.764
Uh--oh, God, the Irish guy?

26:38.848 --> 26:40.391
You're friends with him?

26:40.474 --> 26:41.767
Oh, no, not really.

26:41.851 --> 26:43.519
I just know him a little
from around.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.563
Yeah, my boy Tobey hired him
on a remodel.

26:45.646 --> 26:47.648
Nightmare.
That joker

26:47.732 --> 26:49.442
took six months longer
than he said he would.

26:49.525 --> 26:52.153
Charged three times more,
and threw a temper tantrum

26:52.236 --> 26:54.322
about taking out
some fucking wainscoting.

26:54.405 --> 26:56.949
Anyway, need a wood guy,
just call me.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.535
Okay, I appreciate that.

27:00.077 --> 27:02.538
So it's, uh, 540 firm,

27:02.622 --> 27:04.790
and I've got another offer
on the table, so...

27:06.459 --> 27:08.502
What do you think the rental
increase per square foot

27:08.586 --> 27:10.963
is gonna be year to year,
with gentrification?

27:12.590 --> 27:14.508
At least 20%.
Maybe more.

27:14.592 --> 27:16.927
Really?
Huh.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.513
Aren't things
actually leveling off,

27:19.597 --> 27:21.891
down a few percentage points
last quarter?

27:21.974 --> 27:24.518
CBD heading towards
an equilibrium?

27:24.602 --> 27:26.145
Sorry to interrupt.

27:26.228 --> 27:28.731
Fiona, gotta get you to your
next closing by 1:00.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.984
Who's this little guy?

27:32.068 --> 27:34.028
This is my intern, Liam.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.112
He's a prodigy.
Anyway,

27:35.196 --> 27:36.489
nice to meet you,
Mr....?

27:36.572 --> 27:38.240
Whitford.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.076
Here.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.036
Hey, you know what?

27:42.119 --> 27:43.579
You seem savvy.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.207
Why don't you let me show you
something else?

27:46.290 --> 27:49.794
I got another property just off
Malcolm X, not even listed yet.

27:49.877 --> 27:51.796
What do you say,
can you push your 1:00?

27:56.008 --> 27:57.426
Okay, just this once.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.845
Fantastic.
I'll text you the address.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.685
- Look who's back!
- I'm bringing 'em back.

28:05.768 --> 28:07.395
What the hell
are you doing now?

28:07.478 --> 28:10.606
I'm bringing 'em back, asshole,
just like I said I would.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.775
See?
I'm bringing 'em.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.110
Here they are.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.111
I didn't ask
for that sign!

28:15.194 --> 28:16.570
Brand new, see?

28:16.654 --> 28:17.947
They were defective.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.532
I don't want
any more signs!

28:20.032 --> 28:21.534
It was defective.

28:21.617 --> 28:23.661
What are you, an idiot?
Jesus.

28:23.744 --> 28:26.080
Who you calling
an idiot?

28:38.050 --> 28:39.593
Can I help you?

28:39.677 --> 28:42.346
Yeah, heard you guys might be
in need of some volunteers.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.390
You wanna volunteer?
Here?

28:44.473 --> 28:47.143
Yes, sir. I'm in need of some
documented community service.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.394
Trying to get into West Point.

28:48.477 --> 28:51.230
Well, great.
Military boy, huh?

28:51.313 --> 28:53.691
Yeah, strong stomach.
Perfect.

28:53.774 --> 28:56.110
How much can you bench, son?
'Cause these sons of bitches

28:56.193 --> 28:57.361
can get heavy.

28:57.445 --> 29:00.072
Uh, what is it exactly
you guys are doing here?

29:00.156 --> 29:01.490
Well, come on back,
I'll show you.

29:05.619 --> 29:08.414
Got a, uh, 15-year-old
Rottweiler in there

29:08.497 --> 29:10.958
and a pair of
16-year-old Mastiffs.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.418
Should be done in a second.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.502
Done?

29:13.586 --> 29:16.213
Yeah. Only takes three
or four minutes,

29:16.297 --> 29:18.758
if you get the, uh, hose
on the tailpipe right.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.263
You're killing dogs?

29:24.346 --> 29:28.017
Yeah. That's the service
we offer the community, son.

29:28.100 --> 29:32.772
Euthanasia for elderly,
and, uh, terminally ill dogs.

29:32.855 --> 29:34.857
I'm a retired vet.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.110
Had my own practice
for, uh, 38 years.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.780
And I got sick of seeing these
poor people around here

29:40.863 --> 29:43.866
shooting their own dogs in the
street when they got old,

29:43.949 --> 29:46.827
toss 'em in dumpsters
and drop 'em off the bridge

29:46.911 --> 29:49.497
with a--with a cinderblock
tied to their paw.

29:49.580 --> 29:52.958
And all because they
couldn't afford the $150

29:53.042 --> 29:54.794
to put 'em down at the vet's.

29:54.877 --> 29:57.129
Well, now they can call
Soothing Horizon.

29:57.213 --> 30:00.925
We pick 'em up, bring 'em here,
and let 'em go peaceful.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.301
In a gas chamber?

30:02.384 --> 30:03.719
Yep.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.681
Uh...

30:07.765 --> 30:09.642
Banjo and Lucky are dead.

30:11.185 --> 30:14.230
Skippy too.
Come on, grab a leg.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.107
Did you see his face

30:17.191 --> 30:19.235
when I called out
his 20% lie?

30:19.318 --> 30:22.112
He was like,
"Ah, damn!"

30:22.196 --> 30:25.157
God, we crushed it back there.

30:25.241 --> 30:26.659
Did you find
another private school?

30:26.742 --> 30:29.745
No, but there are
57 private schools in Chicago.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.539
One must need a token.

30:31.622 --> 30:32.873
And stop fidgeting
with your hair.

30:32.957 --> 30:34.875
It reads weak.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.171
Two hundred grand...

30:39.255 --> 30:40.840
Campaign Manager Alejan--

30:40.923 --> 30:43.133
Speaking engagement at
the Black Corporate Officers

30:43.217 --> 30:45.594
of America Conference.
And where did my opponent...

30:45.678 --> 30:47.805
- ...put that money?
- Are you Alejandro?

30:47.888 --> 30:50.140
Right in her pocket.

30:50.224 --> 30:52.142
If by "pocket" Isaac
Ruiz means my campaign...

30:52.226 --> 30:53.602
- ...then yes...
- Alejandro?

30:53.686 --> 30:55.312
- No.
- ...I am guilty.

30:55.396 --> 30:57.690
Guilty of trying to represent
my constituents

30:57.773 --> 30:59.608
by staying in office.

30:59.692 --> 31:03.153
And Isaac Ruiz is one to talk.
He's a Republican businessman.

31:03.237 --> 31:07.032
Took a $500,000 donation
from the Mexican Youth

31:07.116 --> 31:10.661
Soccer Organization and then
announced massive plans

31:10.744 --> 31:14.707
to turn our baseball fields
into turf soccer fields.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.126
Hey, what--what's
going on here?

31:17.209 --> 31:18.836
It's the
Ruiz/Wyman debate.

31:18.919 --> 31:22.381
They are the congressional
candidates from this district.

31:22.464 --> 31:23.757
Congress, huh?

31:23.841 --> 31:26.302
...to turn this
condemned eyesore

31:26.385 --> 31:30.472
into an LGBTQ Latino Center
of South Side.

31:31.974 --> 31:33.183
What about
the hardworking

31:33.267 --> 31:35.394
African-American citizens

31:35.477 --> 31:37.563
who want a Martin Luther King
African Art Center

31:37.646 --> 31:38.814
in that brewery?

31:38.898 --> 31:41.317
Hey, um...

31:41.400 --> 31:42.735
you Alejandro?

31:42.818 --> 31:45.112
Uh, yes.
Uh, sir, uh, sorry.

31:45.195 --> 31:46.739
- Contributions are over there.
- No, no, no.

31:46.822 --> 31:49.658
I--I wanna get paid.
I, uh--I put up signs.

31:49.742 --> 31:52.494
A hundred and ten dollars.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.371
So, uh...

31:54.455 --> 31:58.751
You must be
Frank Rodriguez?

31:58.834 --> 32:00.294
In the flesh.

32:01.921 --> 32:03.339
Thank you, <i>mi amigo.</i>

32:08.969 --> 32:12.806
Here at Basic we have
?
a strict no nothing" policy.

32:12.890 --> 32:16.393
No acting up, no crying,
and no snitching.

32:16.477 --> 32:18.812
What happens at Basic
stays at Basic.

32:18.896 --> 32:21.732
That toilet's not gonna
clean itself, little missy.

32:21.815 --> 32:22.858
Get down in there.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.652
Come on, keep coming.

32:25.861 --> 32:28.530
Through here.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.368
This is our infant area.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.287
And out here is
where we hold our older kids.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.874
We call it
the Imagination Area.

32:42.211 --> 32:43.212
Where are the toys?

32:43.295 --> 32:44.672
Bunnies?

32:44.755 --> 32:47.007
See, that's just it.
You use your imagination.

32:47.091 --> 32:48.717
You imagine toys.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.263
So...

32:54.014 --> 32:56.225
- Doesn't look like much.
- Yet.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.227
But this is
a killer opportunity.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.104
Trust me, everything
on this block

33:00.187 --> 33:02.940
is gonna quadruple in value
in the next five years.

33:03.023 --> 33:05.818
You could put in a cold slab
ice cream store there.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.404
A yoga studio.
Pilates.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.780
Sky's the limit.

33:09.863 --> 33:11.281
Why quadruple?

33:11.365 --> 33:12.574
There's a new project coming
in down the street.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.243
Not announced yet.

33:15.202 --> 33:17.037
The nursing home rumor is true?

33:17.705 --> 33:18.914
Yeah.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.333
We're putting in another Sunset
Brook Senior Care Center.

33:21.417 --> 33:22.501
Wow.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.461
Nobody wants to change
parental diapers.

33:24.545 --> 33:25.629
It's sad, right?

33:25.713 --> 33:28.215
Lack of gratitude
for our most vulnerable.

33:28.966 --> 33:31.176
Anyways, there's a Whole Foods
coming in down the street.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.554
Serving this up to you
in a silver platter.

33:35.431 --> 33:37.224
Any way to get in
on the Sunset Brook deal?

33:37.307 --> 33:39.476
No, no, I'm sorry.
I'm way oversubscribed

33:39.560 --> 33:40.936
on that as it is.
I mean, I had to fight

33:41.020 --> 33:42.604
to get my own money into it.

33:42.688 --> 33:45.024
But this is the opportunity
right here.

33:46.275 --> 33:47.735
So, interested?

33:47.818 --> 33:48.986
In Sunset Brook I am.

33:50.404 --> 33:52.531
Listen, I gotta get to a drinks
thing at Fig & Cherry,

33:52.614 --> 33:54.324
but if either of the properties
I showed you interest you,

33:54.408 --> 33:55.325
just give me a call.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.995
Unless you wanna come along
for drinks.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.539
Drinks could turn into dinner,
it could turn into...

34:00.622 --> 34:01.749
maybe more.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.670
You should really let me in
on this Sunset Brook deal.

34:06.754 --> 34:08.964
I got cash in hand.
I know the neighborhood.

34:09.048 --> 34:10.966
Drinks?
Yay, nay?

34:11.925 --> 34:14.011
I think I already have a thing,
don't I?

34:14.094 --> 34:15.471
Dinner with investors.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.056
We needed to leave
five minutes ago.

34:17.139 --> 34:19.391
Well, nice to meet you.

34:19.475 --> 34:21.060
Absolutely,
let's stay in touch.

34:21.143 --> 34:23.896
I'll see you, Lance.
Stay fresh.

34:25.939 --> 34:27.357
What a douchebag.

34:27.441 --> 34:28.901
Beyond.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.465
Hey!

34:51.548 --> 34:53.801
Hey.

34:53.884 --> 34:55.302
Xan, stop!

34:57.262 --> 34:58.430
Xan.

35:00.307 --> 35:01.475
Xan.

35:01.558 --> 35:03.060
Come here.
Come here.

35:03.143 --> 35:04.895
- You stop trying to hit me.
- Get off of me.

35:04.978 --> 35:06.814
I'm not going back
to DCFS.

35:06.897 --> 35:08.524
What are you talking--

35:08.607 --> 35:09.608
Fuck!

35:09.691 --> 35:10.943
Would you stop?

35:12.611 --> 35:16.448
I didn't call DCFS, dumbass.
I'm on your side.

35:16.532 --> 35:18.700
Jesus Christ.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.285
The hell's going on with you?

35:22.246 --> 35:24.248
Can't leave toddlers
in the park, Xan.

35:24.331 --> 35:25.707
The lady was gonna
call the cops on me.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.293
Yeah, well, why were you
stealing from her?

35:29.128 --> 35:31.130
I would've given you the money.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.842
What'd you need
the money for anyway?

35:35.884 --> 35:37.594
My mom.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.390
Your mom's around?

35:41.849 --> 35:43.684
No, but she has a P.O. box

35:43.767 --> 35:45.686
at the mailbox place
around the corner.

35:45.769 --> 35:47.521
That's where she gets
her SNAP benefits,

35:47.604 --> 35:50.566
so I try to leave a little
money in there for her when I can.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.908
You can't be doing that shit,
all right?

36:03.495 --> 36:07.624
All right, my mom, she was
always disappearing, okay?

36:07.708 --> 36:09.960
Always asking me for money,
but you can't do it.

36:10.043 --> 36:12.337
She doesn't ask me.

36:13.964 --> 36:16.425
Okay.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.432
Listen, I'm gonna put some
money in your mom's P.O. box,

36:23.515 --> 36:24.808
all right?

36:24.892 --> 36:27.060
But you cannot do this again.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.022
M'kay.

36:31.231 --> 36:32.524
All right.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.575
Where's that lady's wallet,
huh?

36:41.658 --> 36:43.076
She's pissed as shit.

36:43.619 --> 36:44.912
In a dumpster on Ellis.

36:49.917 --> 36:52.461
- Where are you going?
- Dumpster diving.

36:54.213 --> 36:55.631
Coming?

37:00.928 --> 37:02.429
And then the puppy said,

37:02.512 --> 37:04.014
"Let's be friends, Kitty."

37:04.097 --> 37:05.641
And Kitty felt afraid,

37:05.724 --> 37:08.268
because cats are
supposed to be scared of dogs.

37:08.352 --> 37:10.562
But Kitty decided to be brave

37:10.646 --> 37:14.650
because dogs and cats
can be best friends.

37:20.489 --> 37:22.616
- Great puppet show, Sister.
- Thank you.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.910
The children help make the
puppets out of donated clothes

37:24.993 --> 37:26.245
- and milk cartons.
- Mm!

37:26.328 --> 37:27.704
Teaches creativity
and recycling.

37:27.788 --> 37:31.083
Mm! Let's cut to the chase,
Sister.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.584
How much?

37:32.668 --> 37:34.169
Well, we try to keep
tuition affordable,

37:34.253 --> 37:36.088
so we only charge $150 a week,

37:36.171 --> 37:38.799
but we do need
your child to be baptized.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.550
Is your little one baptized?

37:40.634 --> 37:41.718
- 100%.
- Baptized.

37:41.802 --> 37:44.304
Dunked in the water.
We're very religious.

37:44.388 --> 37:46.431
We pray every night
and we put those dirty crosses

37:46.515 --> 37:47.557
on our faces.

37:47.641 --> 37:49.309
He means on Ash Wednesday.

37:49.393 --> 37:50.477
Sometimes Thursdays too.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.312
We are down with the Christ.

37:54.106 --> 37:56.233
Then the one spot we have open
is all yours,

37:56.316 --> 37:57.484
Mr. and Mrs. Ball.

37:58.318 --> 38:00.112
Sorry, did you say one spot?

38:00.195 --> 38:01.947
Yes, you're in luck.

38:02.030 --> 38:04.992
Little Emily-Jo joined her
parents on their Sudan mission.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.377
Ian, we love you!

38:31.560 --> 38:33.186
Are you okay?

38:33.270 --> 38:35.814
Yeah.
Just used to being in lock up.

38:35.897 --> 38:37.899
Right.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.068
- Who are all these people?
- They're the movement.

38:40.152 --> 38:42.321
This is Jo, Beth,
Sara, Monte, and Kimby,

38:42.404 --> 38:43.572
our Senior Council.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.073
Let's get you to
the conference room.

38:45.157 --> 38:47.326
We told them only
one selfie per person.

38:47.409 --> 38:48.744
- Selfies?
- Our donors.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.996
If you give 1K or more, you get
a step and repeat

38:51.079 --> 38:52.789
- with Gay Jesus.
- Wait. Geneva, donors?

38:52.873 --> 38:54.291
For your bail.

38:54.374 --> 38:57.544
It's exciting, isn't it?
How much we've grown.

38:57.627 --> 39:00.422
Because of you,
thanks to you.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.132
Oh, give 'em the index cards.

39:02.591 --> 39:03.967
Monte wrote
a statement for you.

39:04.051 --> 39:07.637
He used to work in publicity
for Leo Burnett.

39:07.721 --> 39:10.682
"My harrowing
and abusive time in jail"?

39:10.766 --> 39:12.351
Good, right?

39:12.434 --> 39:13.935
Prison was inspiring.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.979
Well, just emphasize your
oppression as a gay man

39:16.063 --> 39:17.939
and the daily violence
you endured.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.442
What is this?

39:20.525 --> 39:22.027
Oh, that's all the van
torchings we've done.

39:22.110 --> 39:23.862
We're doing more tomorrow
in your honor.

39:23.945 --> 39:25.155
Why?

39:25.238 --> 39:28.533
It's become a symbol of freeing
kids from oppression.

39:28.617 --> 39:31.161
Oh.
We got you this to wear.

39:31.244 --> 39:33.246
It'll make a
great picture for the website.

39:34.331 --> 39:37.709
- Am I allowed to take a piss?
- Sure, yeah, of course.

39:37.793 --> 39:39.795
It--it's around the corner,
just make it quick.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.713
Press conference starts in ten.

39:59.231 --> 40:02.317
<i>♪♪ Watch us disappear ♪♪</i>

40:02.401 --> 40:04.778
<i>♪♪ Back into the ether ♪♪</i>

40:07.489 --> 40:09.866
One point seven million.

40:09.950 --> 40:11.159
You hear that?

40:11.243 --> 40:13.662
And the Sunset Brook up in
Evanston sold two years

40:13.745 --> 40:16.706
after initial acquisition
with a $2 million profit.

40:16.790 --> 40:19.042
That piece of shit
is sitting on a golden egg,

40:19.126 --> 40:21.169
and he's trying to unload
that dump on me

40:21.253 --> 40:22.921
that hasn't been renovated
since the '80s

40:23.004 --> 40:25.757
and has been on the market
since--I--when, Liam?

40:25.841 --> 40:28.468
February. Asking price went
down on Looper yesterday.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.595
- Unbelievable.
- 'Cause he's a dick.

40:30.679 --> 40:31.680
I told you that.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.515
The nursing home offering
is still online.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.392
It says there's five
partnership spots left.

40:40.647 --> 40:42.357
Oh, he's a fucking liar.

40:42.441 --> 40:44.526
He's putting the whole thing
together and he wrote me off

40:44.609 --> 40:46.236
as dollar store trash?

40:46.319 --> 40:48.572
'Cause he's a dick.
I told you that.

40:48.655 --> 40:51.366
Can you stop reminding me
that you were right?

40:51.450 --> 40:52.701
He try to sleep
with you as well?

40:52.784 --> 40:54.911
Yes, he tried to sleep with me.

40:54.995 --> 40:56.955
No, he didn't take me
seriously.

40:57.038 --> 40:59.332
And yes,
you were completely right.

40:59.416 --> 41:01.251
And he's not gonna get away
with it.

41:01.334 --> 41:03.253
Sunset Brook is
coming to my neighborhood.

41:03.336 --> 41:05.755
It's coming to my backyard.
It's gonna print money.

41:05.839 --> 41:08.091
And I want in.
Come on, Liam.

41:08.175 --> 41:10.051
Where are we going?

41:10.135 --> 41:13.555
To take what's ours.

41:16.641 --> 41:20.270
Don't worry, Sergeant,
he won't feel any pain.

41:20.353 --> 41:22.063
The injection doesn't hurt.

41:22.147 --> 41:25.942
And he'll be buried in a grassy
field down by the lake.

41:26.026 --> 41:27.486
That's a great
comfort to me.

41:27.569 --> 41:29.404
Thank you.
I love Biscuit.

41:29.488 --> 41:31.448
Of course you do.
And he loves you.

41:31.531 --> 41:33.450
When you're ready,
we'll begin.

41:36.036 --> 41:37.621
Put the music on.

41:37.704 --> 41:40.290
And, uh, toss some rose pedals.

41:40.373 --> 41:41.458
Not all of them.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.502
Save some for the others.

41:45.545 --> 41:48.507
There's my boy.
There's my good boy.

41:50.091 --> 41:51.885
God, he's a service dog?

41:51.968 --> 41:55.764
Yep, General Biscuit's been
with me since Afghanistan.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.349
I lost an eye.

41:58.433 --> 41:59.935
I gained a best friend.

42:02.145 --> 42:03.897
Thick and thin, eh, buddy?

42:04.564 --> 42:07.317
<i>♪♪ Lord be with you ♪♪</i>

42:07.400 --> 42:11.404
<i>♪♪ Till we meet again ♪♪</i>

42:14.908 --> 42:17.452
Over there, all right?
Yo.

42:17.536 --> 42:20.163
So where the hell was she?

42:20.247 --> 42:22.332
Oh, it's a long story.
Sorry I'm so late.

42:22.415 --> 42:24.459
I'll work tonight,
make up for it.

42:25.377 --> 42:26.962
Don't worry about it.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.172
Hey, could you, uh,
toss me the torque wrench?

42:29.256 --> 42:30.298
Yeah.

42:33.385 --> 42:34.719
Thanks.

42:38.139 --> 42:39.307
What's up?

42:44.396 --> 42:47.691
I wanna tell you something.
As a friend.

42:47.774 --> 42:49.192
Are you coming out to me, man?

42:50.902 --> 42:52.696
You should sponsor
that guy with the baby.

42:53.780 --> 42:54.781
Fuck.

42:54.864 --> 42:56.866
It's the next stage in your
sobriety, you're ready.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.371
What am I supposed to say
to that guy, Brad, huh?

43:01.454 --> 43:03.456
"You can do it"?

43:03.540 --> 43:06.918
- I can barely do it myself.
- Then so say that to him.

43:07.002 --> 43:09.421
Look, you've already been
a sponsor without knowing it.

43:09.504 --> 43:11.798
Look what you did for Youens,
and for me.

43:13.717 --> 43:15.635
I got enough shit to be
stressed about, all right?

43:15.719 --> 43:17.387
Lip.

43:17.470 --> 43:19.598
Helping another AA member is
a hell of a lot better

43:19.681 --> 43:23.018
for your sobriety than chasing
after a kid who's not yours.

43:25.562 --> 43:28.356
Gallaghers don't sponsor.
We get sponsored.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.441
It's in our DNA.

43:29.524 --> 43:31.484
Well, maybe you're
more than your DNA.

43:31.568 --> 43:33.612
At least I think you are.

43:37.741 --> 43:40.201
I gotta take a leak.
You take 'em in there

43:40.285 --> 43:41.661
and, uh, give 'em some treats

43:41.745 --> 43:44.331
and, uh, make 'em feel real
comfy and then get started.

43:44.414 --> 43:46.666
Uh, you know,
maybe we could wait a second.

43:48.043 --> 43:49.044
Wait for what?

43:49.127 --> 43:52.088
I mean, let 'em die naturally.
They're practically dead.

43:52.672 --> 43:54.924
Plus Biscuit's a vet.
Deserves better.

43:55.008 --> 43:56.885
I couldn't agree with you more,
son,

43:56.968 --> 43:58.762
but I'm a not-for-profit.

43:58.845 --> 44:01.181
I get 20, 25 dogs
through here a week.

44:01.264 --> 44:05.185
That's a lot of dog food,
doggy diapers, medications.

44:05.268 --> 44:08.813
Some of them need a senior
diet, and that's twice as much.

44:08.897 --> 44:11.941
So, uh, get started.
Chop chop.

44:17.697 --> 44:19.407
It's open!

44:19.491 --> 44:22.243
I'll be right down, Farhad.

44:22.327 --> 44:26.039
Hello?
Looking for Debbie Gallagher.

44:26.122 --> 44:28.500
What the fuck
are you doing here?

44:28.583 --> 44:29.709
Can I talk
to you a minute?

44:29.793 --> 44:31.503
No. How did you find me?

44:31.586 --> 44:34.005
You told everyone in Chicago
your name is Debbie Gallagher

44:34.089 --> 44:36.007
and you're a welder
with a vagina.

44:36.091 --> 44:37.801
- Not hard to find.
- What do you want?

44:37.884 --> 44:40.470
- I'm gonna be late.
- I lied to you this morning.

44:40.553 --> 44:42.847
There is another woman
on my site.

44:42.931 --> 44:44.224
Who?

44:44.307 --> 44:45.892
Me.

44:46.559 --> 44:48.228
You're a woman?

44:48.311 --> 44:50.313
I don't wanna get paid
1/3 of what the dudes make.

44:51.106 --> 44:52.440
It's bullshit.

44:52.524 --> 44:54.859
My last job I was
the best electrician on site.

44:54.943 --> 44:56.403
Foreman paid me 1/3
of what the guys got.

44:56.486 --> 44:58.363
Now, I got a good gig,

44:58.446 --> 45:01.366
but you saw how Neanderthal
them jokers can be.

45:01.449 --> 45:02.617
I'm in the lion's den.

45:02.701 --> 45:05.370
I had to pull
a <i>Boys Don't Cry.</i>

45:05.453 --> 45:07.664
Wow. That's hardcore.

45:07.747 --> 45:10.625
You can't tell. My foreman's
a piece of dog shit.

45:13.628 --> 45:15.380
Oh, sorry, I don't mean
stare at you.

45:15.463 --> 45:17.132
You just really look
like a dude.

45:17.215 --> 45:20.719
Yeah, yeah, I--I know.

45:20.802 --> 45:23.763
Ah, shit, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for work.

45:23.847 --> 45:27.100
Yeah.
Um...

45:27.183 --> 45:28.268
what time do you get off?

45:28.351 --> 45:30.437
Maybe you wanna
grab a beer later,

45:30.520 --> 45:31.688
topple the patriarchy?

45:31.771 --> 45:33.398
Hell yeah.
I'm off at 9:00.

45:33.481 --> 45:36.317
All right, then, it's a...
it's a date.

45:43.992 --> 45:45.410
...Because I don't know
if anybody's

45:45.493 --> 45:47.078
gonna be there to pick me up.

45:47.162 --> 45:49.289
You still got five limited
partnerships available

45:49.372 --> 45:51.291
on that Sunset Brook lot.

45:52.250 --> 45:53.793
So what the hell, Whitford?

45:54.252 --> 45:56.087
Do you think
I'm not smart enough?

45:56.171 --> 45:58.381
Or you just like
making women feel like

45:58.465 --> 46:00.550
they need to fuck you
to join an LLC?

46:01.217 --> 46:02.844
Um...

46:03.470 --> 46:05.972
This is Fiona Gallagher.
She's--she's very passionate

46:06.055 --> 46:07.515
about real estate.

46:07.599 --> 46:09.142
I know the neighborhood.
I know the people.

46:09.225 --> 46:11.269
I know the old people you're
gonna put in diapers.

46:11.352 --> 46:12.687
I know the permits.
I know the people

46:12.771 --> 46:14.314
that stamp the permits.

46:14.397 --> 46:16.649
I know that block
like the back of my hand.

46:17.317 --> 46:19.569
I got 50K in my pocket
and I want in.

46:20.069 --> 46:21.988
You'd need 100 to play.

46:23.323 --> 46:25.241
Then I got 100 in my pocket.

46:26.075 --> 46:27.994
So what do you say?

46:29.579 --> 46:31.331
Am I in?
Or am I out?

46:31.414 --> 46:32.874
'Cause if I'm in,
I'll leave.

46:33.708 --> 46:35.251
But if I'm not,

46:36.211 --> 46:37.962
I'm gonna keep standing here.

46:39.047 --> 46:42.091
And I'm gonna eat every one
of your goddamn breadsticks.

46:49.974 --> 46:51.810
Let me ask you fine gentlemen,

46:51.893 --> 46:54.479
which of these congressional
candidates look like you?

46:54.562 --> 46:58.066
That's a gay Latino man and
a semi-hot black woman, Frank.

46:58.149 --> 47:01.945
Exactly. American men
used to control everything.

47:02.028 --> 47:04.781
Look at a history book.
We used to be the leading men.

47:04.864 --> 47:06.741
Now, we're marginalized.

47:06.825 --> 47:10.078
I attended a congressional
debate this afternoon,

47:10.161 --> 47:11.955
and you know
what I experienced?

47:12.038 --> 47:13.998
Reverse racism.

47:14.082 --> 47:17.043
It's all diverse gays
and vaginas now.

47:17.126 --> 47:19.254
The tide is changing,
gentlemen,

47:19.337 --> 47:22.882
and it's changing
too damn fast, am I right?

47:28.471 --> 47:29.889
Give me a beer.

47:31.599 --> 47:33.518
I'll tell you something else.

47:33.601 --> 47:36.145
They're trying to take the Old
Blue Brewery away from us.

47:36.229 --> 47:40.733
They wanna convert it into
an LTGB-E-I-E-I-O,

47:40.817 --> 47:44.195
or a--a goddamn
African Art gallery?

47:44.279 --> 47:45.655
So?

47:45.738 --> 47:47.699
We need a candidate of our own,
boys.

47:47.782 --> 47:50.410
A bright, shining
beacon of hope.

47:50.493 --> 47:52.745
We need someone who will
promote and protect

47:52.829 --> 47:55.582
our values.
Someone who'll make sure

47:55.665 --> 47:57.959
our culture doesn't disappear.

47:58.042 --> 48:01.713
Someone who sat on a barstool
and stared down the gun barrel

48:01.796 --> 48:04.173
that is the working class
experience.

48:04.257 --> 48:05.842
But who?

48:08.469 --> 48:09.804
What about Mo White?

48:09.888 --> 48:12.807
- He died.
- He did? Are you sure?

48:12.891 --> 48:14.726
He did--somebody check.
Did he die?

48:14.809 --> 48:17.520
Uh, says here he's alive,
just retired.

48:17.604 --> 48:21.316
Well, that's perfect.
Mo White is a genius idea.

48:21.399 --> 48:24.569
He was a true American
congressman.

48:24.652 --> 48:28.114
He loosened the liquor license
rules so that the Irish

48:28.197 --> 48:29.908
would have some place to drink.

48:29.991 --> 48:31.576
He helped rebuild Comiskey.

48:31.659 --> 48:33.995
He put in bocce
for our Italian brothers.

48:34.078 --> 48:36.664
- A--and--and horse-shoe pits.
- That's right.

48:36.748 --> 48:38.291
Didn't he keep
the Chris Columbus memorial

48:38.374 --> 48:39.626
from being torn down?

48:39.709 --> 48:41.085
You bet your
ass he did.

48:41.169 --> 48:43.004
Mo White is a friend
of the South Side.

48:43.087 --> 48:45.965
We gotta find Mo White
and write White in.

48:46.049 --> 48:48.801
We need seed money
for his campaign.

48:48.885 --> 48:50.470
Ten bucks.
I'll go first.

48:50.553 --> 48:52.305
Give me that.
Ten bucks.

48:52.388 --> 48:54.182
Everybody, ten bucks.
What do you say?

48:54.265 --> 48:55.600
Come on, yeah.

48:55.683 --> 48:57.769
The fundraising
starts right now.

48:57.852 --> 49:00.313
The campaign pot
is coming around.

49:00.396 --> 49:03.483
Hey, let's make Chicago
white again.

49:03.566 --> 49:05.109
Yeah.

49:05.193 --> 49:08.404
- Mo White, Mo White...
- Mo White...

49:15.370 --> 49:18.456
I got it.
Mo White, Mo White.

49:18.539 --> 49:22.335
Yeah.
Mo White, Mo White, Mo White.

49:28.091 --> 49:29.968
Yeah, I know this
isn't the Ritz-Carlton,

49:30.051 --> 49:33.054
but the Gallagher basement
beats the murder van, guys.

49:33.137 --> 49:35.723
I got you guys some water.

49:35.807 --> 49:39.227
I'm gonna do a Petco run.
Any requests?

49:39.310 --> 49:42.021
No? All right, well,
you guys just relax,

49:42.105 --> 49:45.149
take all the time you need,
just die naturally.

49:45.233 --> 49:46.734
All right?
Take care.

49:56.327 --> 49:58.663
Jesus Christ.
Ian.

49:58.746 --> 50:00.415
- When'd you get out?
- Today.

50:00.498 --> 50:02.542
Welcome home.
You look good.

50:02.625 --> 50:04.127
Did you lean out in there?

50:07.755 --> 50:09.007
So...

50:09.757 --> 50:11.509
what'd I miss
around here?

50:12.301 --> 50:14.345
You know,
same old, same old.

50:16.431 --> 50:18.391
Well, I gotta go pick up
like 80 pounds of kibble.

50:18.474 --> 50:19.809
You know, catch up later?

50:21.019 --> 50:23.104
Yeah, yeah.

50:23.187 --> 50:24.689
Wait, who's the girl on my bed?

50:24.772 --> 50:27.025
Uh, that's Xan,
Lip's kid.

50:29.819 --> 50:31.654
So...

50:31.738 --> 50:33.489
you're both going
to nursery school

50:33.573 --> 50:36.451
and you'll both have
on the exact same outfit,

50:36.534 --> 50:38.828
but you can't ever be in the
same room at the same time.

50:38.911 --> 50:41.039
Gemma, Daddy's gonna drop you
off at the back door.

50:41.122 --> 50:43.916
And Amy, Mommy's gonna drop you
off at the front door.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.543
And Amy,
if you're on the play ground

50:45.626 --> 50:46.627
that means you, Gemma,

50:46.711 --> 50:48.046
you gotta be in the classroom.

50:48.129 --> 50:49.797
And Gemma, if you're in
the arts room,

50:49.881 --> 50:53.092
then Amy, you're gonna
have to hide in your cubby.

50:53.176 --> 50:54.469
And you're both named Amy now.

50:54.552 --> 50:57.972
There is no Gemma.
Gemma doesn't exist anymore.

50:58.056 --> 51:00.475
Only Amy.
And you're devout Catholics,

51:00.558 --> 51:03.686
so cross yourselves a lot,
like this.

51:03.770 --> 51:05.396
Good.

51:05.480 --> 51:06.981
Okay.

51:07.065 --> 51:09.233
This is going to be

51:09.317 --> 51:12.737
a super fun secret family game,
right?

51:12.820 --> 51:15.531
We love you Amy.
We love you, Fake Amy.

51:15.615 --> 51:18.159
We love you, Fake Amy.

51:32.006 --> 51:33.508
Hey. How's it going, man?

51:35.718 --> 51:37.261
I'm here.

51:37.345 --> 51:38.846
Yeah.

51:40.431 --> 51:41.724
Hey.

51:42.725 --> 51:44.143
Coming in?

52:03.663 --> 52:06.332
Hey, man, I tell you what.
Why don't we go in together?

52:06.415 --> 52:08.543
Huh?

52:08.626 --> 52:11.754
Uh, I'll sponsor you.
Come on.

52:13.631 --> 52:16.134
Come on, sweetie, come on.
Come on, you're okay.

52:19.846 --> 52:22.098
We'll get some pie
after and talk.

52:22.765 --> 52:24.392
I know a good place.

52:24.475 --> 52:25.935
I don't eat pie.

52:26.602 --> 52:28.104
Now you do.

52:37.446 --> 52:39.866
- Can I help you?
- Mo White?

52:39.949 --> 52:40.950
Yeah.

52:41.993 --> 52:43.161
Yeah, who are you?

52:46.289 --> 52:49.750
Sir, your country needs you.

52:52.795 --> 52:53.963
Uh-huh?

52:54.672 --> 52:56.215
All right,
pick your poison.

52:56.299 --> 52:58.342
- Grape or punch?
- Punch.
