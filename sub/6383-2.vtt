00:01.089 --> 00:03.123
- So, Hank.
- Meredith.

00:03.383 --> 00:05.151
- You're a writer.
- A great writer.

00:05.346 --> 00:07.478
You know what the worst thing is?
You're not writing.

00:07.625 --> 00:10.703
- Are you familiar with Hell-A Magazine?
- Hell, no.

00:10.843 --> 00:13.342
They would like you to blog for them.

00:13.563 --> 00:14.675
Do you have a gun?

00:14.836 --> 00:17.693
You're out there sticking your dick
in anything that moves.

00:18.815 --> 00:20.812
- My name is Hank.
- I know.

00:25.631 --> 00:27.475
- Who did she go with?
- Bill's daughter.

00:27.606 --> 00:28.817
I didn't know he had one.

00:28.939 --> 00:30.238
- How old is she?
- 16.

00:30.410 --> 00:31.927
This is Mia, Bill's daughter.

00:32.067 --> 00:33.618
And this is Hank.

00:34.019 --> 00:36.272
- You two know each other?
- No.

00:36.625 --> 00:37.825
- I need you, baby.
- No.

00:38.745 --> 00:40.369
Hank, I'm getting married.

00:42.213 --> 00:44.326
Don't marry him. Marry me.

00:50.610 --> 00:51.728
I hate you.

01:09.666 --> 01:11.422
What are you thinking about?

01:12.552 --> 01:15.529
I'm thinking about how much
I absolutely fucking loathe this city.

01:17.413 --> 01:21.118
Just as I was thinking about
how much I absolutely love it.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.955
Meanwhile, I haven't written
a goddamn word since we got here.

01:25.515 --> 01:26.748
You need to relax.

01:27.993 --> 01:29.751
I just miss New York, honey.

01:30.567 --> 01:34.548
You know, and I miss you,
because you're still there,

01:34.808 --> 01:36.773
in that big, thick head of yours.

01:37.672 --> 01:39.034
Come back to us, Hank.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.279
Your girls miss you.

01:51.753 --> 01:52.941
Who are you talking to?

01:54.336 --> 01:55.402
Nobody.

01:55.662 --> 01:57.654
- Professional hazard.
- What do you do?

01:59.183 --> 02:00.282
I'm a writer.

02:01.145 --> 02:02.451
Non practicing.

02:03.803 --> 02:05.245
I've got something you could read.

02:16.414 --> 02:18.217
I think you have potential.

03:22.893 --> 03:24.533
- Hank.
- Bob.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.200
- Bill.
- Really?

03:26.670 --> 03:29.231
- Becca doesn't want to see you.
- You looking for a cock punch?

03:29.389 --> 03:31.410
- Let me talk to her.
- Trust me, as the father

03:31.570 --> 03:32.674
of a teenage daughter,

03:32.815 --> 03:34.883
just give her some space.
She'll come around.

03:35.884 --> 03:38.790
- You know something, Bill, is it?
- Yep. Still Bill.

03:38.930 --> 03:41.266
Well, I appreciate
the parenting advice, but maybe,

03:41.388 --> 03:44.205
just maybe, giving them too much space
is not such a good idea.

03:44.346 --> 03:46.893
Maybe too much space
is actually the root of the problem.

03:47.033 --> 03:48.974
Hank, please... My daughter is 16,

03:49.234 --> 03:52.060
and she's an angel.
Clearly I'm doing something right.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.021
- You poor bastard.
- Excuse me?

03:54.281 --> 03:55.530
- Homo says what?
- What?

03:55.670 --> 03:56.796
Gotcha.

03:59.033 --> 04:00.543
What the fuck is that?

04:01.361 --> 04:03.338
You like it?
I could've bought a car instead.

04:03.478 --> 04:05.071
I think you should still buy the car

04:05.235 --> 04:07.075
and then run over
whoever created that turd.

04:07.768 --> 04:09.694
Everything okay here, boys?

04:10.171 --> 04:12.131
- It's all good.
- It's all good?

04:12.319 --> 04:13.573
That's kind of a hip lingo.

04:14.049 --> 04:15.083
"It's all good.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.463
"It's all good."

04:16.807 --> 04:18.952
Yeah, that's what they say, the kids.

04:19.103 --> 04:20.172
I still hate you.

04:20.589 --> 04:21.622
Naturally.

04:21.774 --> 04:23.342
But I do want to see your movie.

04:24.728 --> 04:26.613
It's my book. It's not my movie.

04:26.840 --> 04:27.888
Not my problem.

04:28.148 --> 04:29.412
I like your movie.

04:29.574 --> 04:31.513
How is that even possible, honey?

04:31.941 --> 04:34.519
Because it proves you're not
the asshole they say you are.

04:38.199 --> 04:39.650
Cursing will cost you.

04:45.001 --> 04:46.615
Now who says I'm an asshole?

04:46.822 --> 04:48.276
Can we swap nights this weekend?

04:48.435 --> 04:50.166
We're having some people over
on Saturday,

04:50.320 --> 04:51.652
and I want Becca to be there.

04:51.838 --> 04:54.664
- Uncle Charlie and aunt Marcy.
- Thank you, sweetie.

04:54.924 --> 04:56.958
- Dad should come.
- They're his friends, too.

04:58.043 --> 05:01.380
And uncle Charlie's his agent.
Maybe he has an offer for him.

05:02.423 --> 05:04.216
You're welcome to come, Hank.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.302
Absolutely. Bring a date.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.440
Ear buds.

05:14.328 --> 05:15.352
First of all,

05:15.565 --> 05:18.700
you could not handle me hitting it off
with somebody right in front of you.

05:18.905 --> 05:21.483
You're right. It could be very painful.

05:21.653 --> 05:24.319
- But I think I'll get through it.
- Okay, so I take this

05:24.579 --> 05:26.923
to mean the answer is no,
you're not going to marry me.

05:27.063 --> 05:28.371
Hank, I'm standing right here.

05:28.604 --> 05:30.814
Did you ever stop
and think that it might be nice

05:30.954 --> 05:32.837
for Becca to see us all
get along for a change?

05:33.004 --> 05:34.346
Yes, and it might be nice

05:34.505 --> 05:37.053
if I could fellate myself
while farting the white album,

05:37.209 --> 05:39.184
but I haven't been able
to quite master that yet.

05:39.344 --> 05:41.063
- So...
- Is he coming?

05:41.203 --> 05:42.353
Absolutely.

05:42.514 --> 05:44.589
What can I bring, Bob? Bill.

05:45.199 --> 05:46.883
Whatever the fuck;

05:47.143 --> 05:48.462
that's not a "fuck," Becca.

05:56.308 --> 05:59.943
Your assistant makes me want
to touch myself in a bad place.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.901
That's nice. My assistant makes me want
to hang myself.

06:05.161 --> 06:06.413
While masturbating?

06:06.746 --> 06:08.253
Are you retarded or something?

06:08.438 --> 06:12.238
Funky back tat on the small of the back.
You know what that means.

06:12.669 --> 06:14.035
She likes it in the pooper.

06:15.613 --> 06:16.613
Really?

06:16.814 --> 06:19.116
I have no idea. I just wanted
to say "pooper". Iâ€™ve found

06:19.263 --> 06:22.073
that the back tat is a watermark
of the promiscuous, though.

06:22.364 --> 06:24.600
Still, she's the world's
worst assistant.

06:25.143 --> 06:26.949
She drops calls, she loses manuscripts,

06:27.089 --> 06:29.134
she can't even get
my fucking macchiato right.

06:29.877 --> 06:32.283
But she does seem to have a nipple ring.

06:32.423 --> 06:35.348
Quite possibly two. There is something
very cool going on in that area.

06:37.333 --> 06:40.312
Enough about my assistant's nipples.
You want to talk some business?

06:40.663 --> 06:44.056
- How's the new book coming?
- Now, that's a hostile question.

06:44.546 --> 06:47.753
You have owed your publisher
a book since Becca was breast-feeding.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.400
I remember because I used to like
to watch Karen do that.

06:50.713 --> 06:52.157
Kiss my black ass.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.673
You need a fucking job.

06:56.329 --> 06:58.385
What? Okay. What do you got?

07:00.037 --> 07:01.063
Listen.

07:01.207 --> 07:02.733
- You hear that?
- What?

07:02.873 --> 07:05.295
That's the sound of my phone
not ringing for you.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.547
You have burned every bridge

07:07.807 --> 07:09.432
I built for you with my bare hands.

07:09.601 --> 07:11.972
- Except, of course <i>Hell-A Magazine</i>.
- No, don't say it....

07:12.145 --> 07:15.722
They want you to blog for them.
Just take the fucking meeting already!

07:16.733 --> 07:18.308
Let's ask Dani California.

07:19.326 --> 07:21.232
<i>Hell-A Magazine</i>. Thoughts?

07:22.152 --> 07:23.973
You'd be perfect for them.

07:24.910 --> 07:26.995
Nipple ring? Two?

07:28.870 --> 07:30.129
Anywhere else?

07:31.934 --> 07:33.062
She's got a nose ring, too.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.419
- You know what that means.
- She likes it in the nose?

07:35.627 --> 07:36.627
That is sick.

07:36.836 --> 07:40.118
Look around. L.A. needs you.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.748
Now more than ever.

07:42.334 --> 07:46.486
Your voice is a shotgun blast
to all the pretentious fucks

07:46.685 --> 07:48.838
who pollute
this once-great city of yours.

07:49.098 --> 07:52.259
Just so you know,
it's not and never will be my city.

07:52.728 --> 07:55.003
Use the blog, Hank.

07:55.245 --> 07:56.813
Channel your rage.

07:59.796 --> 08:03.523
You're a dying breed.
You're a real writer, a real man.

08:04.114 --> 08:06.703
You've got heart, balls, and swagger.

08:07.122 --> 08:09.023
Either way.

08:09.785 --> 08:12.073
Come over to the dark side, Hank.

08:12.572 --> 08:15.305
Join us at <i>Hell-A Magazine</i>.

08:15.773 --> 08:18.019
I appreciate the enthusiasm. I do.

08:18.159 --> 08:20.948
- But I don't have much to say.
- Think about it.

08:22.382 --> 08:24.389
Where you going?
I thought I was the real deal.

08:24.910 --> 08:26.793
It's a shame I'm in a relationship.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.970
Write me something, Hank.

08:34.589 --> 08:36.269
- Good night.
- Good night.

08:46.531 --> 08:47.598
The airplane.

09:02.246 --> 09:04.777
- So, what do you think?
- Very little of substance.

09:08.290 --> 09:09.419
My tits.

09:09.954 --> 09:10.962
Seriously.

09:13.556 --> 09:16.259
They seem pretty fucking groovy to me.

09:16.570 --> 09:18.887
- Think they're too small?
- Too small for what?

09:19.064 --> 09:20.761
I want to make them bigger.

09:20.924 --> 09:24.662
They're absolutely almost perfect,
in every conceivable titty way.

09:25.587 --> 09:26.991
What about my lips?

09:29.203 --> 09:30.543
Highly kissable.

09:33.060 --> 09:34.455
Not those lips.

09:35.812 --> 09:36.844
These.

09:44.124 --> 09:45.490
What about them?

09:45.863 --> 09:47.499
Do you think they're too floppy?

09:47.759 --> 09:49.668
- What?
- Floppy?

09:50.933 --> 09:52.416
I think of getting them fixed.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.683
Vaginal rejuvenation.
You heard about it?

09:55.863 --> 09:57.593
Get them trimmed up a little.

09:57.781 --> 10:00.250
That way they don't look like
day-old deli meat.

10:02.478 --> 10:06.149
I think I just lost my manhood.
And got hungry at the same time.

10:07.721 --> 10:09.056
I can help you find that.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.113
You can try.

10:24.671 --> 10:27.548
- Hey, this is you.
- I thought you recognized me.

10:27.689 --> 10:29.332
I'm not a big porn guy, actually.

10:30.113 --> 10:31.382
And who might that be?

10:32.178 --> 10:33.178
My daughter.

10:33.874 --> 10:36.089
Do you need to go... see to her?

10:36.349 --> 10:38.442
It's okay. She'll quiet down.
Don't worry about it.

10:43.421 --> 10:44.532
Go be with your daughter.

10:47.360 --> 10:50.583
I'm gonna have to confiscate
this thing for further study.

11:09.052 --> 11:10.052
Piece of shit!

11:15.203 --> 11:17.505
<i>Hell-A Magazine blog number one.</i>

11:18.040 --> 11:19.140
<i>Hank hates you all.</i>

11:20.409 --> 11:22.049
<i>A few things I've learned in my travels</i>

11:22.212 --> 11:24.587
<i>through this crazy little thing
called life.</i>

11:24.970 --> 11:29.100
<i>One: a morning of awkwardness is
far better than a night of loneliness.</i>

11:30.166 --> 11:33.020
<i>Two:
I probably won't go down in history,</i>

11:33.274 --> 11:34.823
<i>but I will go down on your sister.</i>

11:35.463 --> 11:37.149
<i>And three: while I'm down there,</i>

11:37.597 --> 11:40.073
<i>it might be nice to see a hint of pubis.</i>

11:40.580 --> 11:43.598
<i>I'm not talking about

11:43.718 --> 11:45.540
<i>just something that reminds me</i>

11:45.687 --> 11:47.868
<i>that I'm performing cunnilingus
on an adult.</i>

11:49.338 --> 11:51.215
<i>But I guess the larger question is,</i>

11:51.424 --> 11:54.167
<i>why is the city of angels so hell-bent</i>

11:54.427 --> 11:56.378
<i>on destroying its female population?</i>

12:18.491 --> 12:20.235
Jesus H. Christ.

12:23.553 --> 12:24.736
Nope.

12:25.093 --> 12:26.533
Just little old me.

12:27.303 --> 12:28.368
Are you okay?

12:28.703 --> 12:30.036
You look a little pale.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.375
Are you gonna have a heart attack?

12:32.703 --> 12:33.915
You are getting on in years.

12:34.175 --> 12:37.460
Just because I'm older than you
doesn't necessarily make me old.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.546
Well, I am 16, you know.

12:39.843 --> 12:42.937
- So I've been told.
- What's the word for that again?

12:44.394 --> 12:46.136
It's statutory rape.

12:46.505 --> 12:47.762
That's two words.

12:48.293 --> 12:49.597
Hi, daddy.

12:50.434 --> 12:53.453
Honey, put some clothes on, okay?
We have company.

12:54.153 --> 12:56.229
I'm sure it's nothing
he hasn't seen before.

13:00.810 --> 13:02.833
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for having me.

13:02.953 --> 13:04.028
It's my pleasure.

13:04.483 --> 13:06.030
The pleasure is all mine.

13:06.585 --> 13:07.900
I think this is...

13:09.457 --> 13:11.843
an important first step
we're taking here.

13:12.551 --> 13:13.830
Really? What step is that?

13:14.215 --> 13:15.874
The one where I sit back and watch

13:16.134 --> 13:18.259
as you try to steal my family
out from under me?

13:18.969 --> 13:20.255
It's not gonna happen.

13:20.989 --> 13:22.422
Game on, broheme.

13:23.433 --> 13:24.747
Hey. You didn't have to do that.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.575
Well, I didn't. It's for me.

13:27.508 --> 13:28.733
Sorry about that.

13:29.527 --> 13:31.757
Hank, Sonja.

13:32.952 --> 13:34.366
- Sonja, Hank.
- Hi.

13:34.506 --> 13:35.814
Uh, I love your writing.

13:35.954 --> 13:37.544
And I love you.

13:38.406 --> 13:41.463
I read your adaptation way back
when Soderbergh was gonna do it.

13:41.603 --> 13:44.012
- I fucking loved it.
- Hey, my salad days.

13:44.663 --> 13:46.480
You and I are gonna
get along just fine.

13:46.747 --> 13:47.788
I'm sorry. Honey?

13:47.928 --> 13:50.243
- Can I borrow the missus for a moment?
- Yeah.

13:50.386 --> 13:52.198
Can I talk to you?

13:52.468 --> 13:53.785
What the fuck are you doing?

13:54.618 --> 13:55.618
What do you mean?

13:55.758 --> 13:57.518
You're trying to set me up
with this woman.

13:59.088 --> 14:02.290
I thought it'd be nice for you to have
a play date with someone your own age.

14:02.430 --> 14:03.843
And if we get along swimmingly?

14:05.038 --> 14:06.137
Hankie.

14:06.315 --> 14:08.601
I had to leave you, remember?

14:08.892 --> 14:10.583
I'm not holding a torch here.

14:10.723 --> 14:12.882
And you need to get on
with your life.

14:13.303 --> 14:16.351
And you need to get in touch
with your emotions, woman.

14:21.074 --> 14:23.152
He says he's not used to dating.

14:33.391 --> 14:34.448
Nobody likes you.

14:34.588 --> 14:37.269
You're ugly and
your mother dresses you funny.

14:37.729 --> 14:40.011
Now smile, you fucking douche.

15:08.563 --> 15:09.570
Dad?

15:10.493 --> 15:11.891
- Dad?
- Yes.

15:12.167 --> 15:13.949
- Can I get a dog?
- Absolutely.

15:14.210 --> 15:16.118
Yes. As long as it poops here.

15:16.587 --> 15:17.725
We'll talk about it.

15:20.026 --> 15:21.026
I'm sorry, Hank.

15:21.217 --> 15:22.752
- My apologies.
- That's fine, Bill.

15:22.946 --> 15:23.997
She's very sweet.

15:24.262 --> 15:25.812
Well, I'd like to propose a toast.

15:27.084 --> 15:28.088
To friends...

15:30.142 --> 15:31.142
family...

15:31.765 --> 15:32.854
a new beginning...

15:33.646 --> 15:34.646
And a happy ending!

15:35.027 --> 15:36.035
Well said, honey.

15:36.175 --> 15:38.256
- I'll drink to that.
- Cheers, cheers!

15:42.395 --> 15:44.022
So, how did you and Bill meet?

15:45.523 --> 15:47.617
I don't think this is
the right setting for that...

15:47.757 --> 15:50.994
I think this is the perfect setting
for that story.

15:51.842 --> 15:54.602
Bill hired Karen
to redo his place...
This place.

15:54.831 --> 15:57.883
And along the way, they talked
Zen and the art of the mid-life crisis

15:58.023 --> 16:00.454
and... eventually

16:00.716 --> 16:02.402
fell head over heels in love.

16:02.883 --> 16:04.284
In Karen's case, heels over head.

16:05.023 --> 16:07.753
And Bill got another trophy
for his mantel, and...

16:08.014 --> 16:10.757
Karen got to move into
her own Barbie dream house.

16:12.553 --> 16:14.722
Talk about being the architect
of your very own...

16:14.864 --> 16:16.113
Happy ending!

16:16.552 --> 16:19.427
- Got it.
- That's a bit of an oversimplification.

16:19.734 --> 16:21.998
- But I'm not surprised.
- Floor is all yours, Bill.

16:22.278 --> 16:24.224
- I'll pass.
- That doesn't surprise me.

16:25.119 --> 16:26.535
How did you and Karen meet?

16:26.798 --> 16:29.042
- Some other time, sweetie.
- Mia, I don't think...

16:29.235 --> 16:31.193
What? I'm curious.
Come on!

16:31.455 --> 16:33.061
Karen's not a big fan
of memory lane.

16:33.332 --> 16:34.572
- I'll tell it.
- Rebecca.

16:35.667 --> 16:38.584
Mom was going to art school and playing
bass in this downtown noise band.

16:39.601 --> 16:41.695
Dad had just published his first novel.

16:42.173 --> 16:44.259
They met cute at...
What was it called again?

16:44.559 --> 16:46.229
- CBGB's.
- Right.

16:46.369 --> 16:48.077
He thought she was pretentious,

16:48.227 --> 16:50.903
and she thought he was way
too pleased with himself.

16:51.340 --> 16:52.668
But they had sex anyway.

16:53.476 --> 16:55.485
In the morning,
he made her breakfast,

16:55.767 --> 16:57.869
and she talked about her plan
to move to Seattle

16:58.009 --> 16:59.346
so she could stalk and marry...

16:59.627 --> 17:00.970
Chris Cornell.

17:01.355 --> 17:02.360
Right.

17:02.783 --> 17:04.406
But then she read dad's writing.

17:05.303 --> 17:06.410
And that was it.

17:07.789 --> 17:09.554
Nine months later, I was born.

17:10.609 --> 17:12.498
They never got married, of course.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.343
But they stayed together a long time.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.071
A lot longer than most people do.

17:25.457 --> 17:28.234
Oh, my boyfriend's here.
I got to go. Bye, daddy.

17:32.227 --> 17:33.296
Good night!

17:33.559 --> 17:35.626
- Bye, honey. So long.
- I wish I could tell

17:35.766 --> 17:38.008
an interesting
story about me and my ex,

17:38.148 --> 17:41.271
but it's really just
L.A. clichÃ© number 4b.

17:41.430 --> 17:42.933
He was sleeping with his assistant.

17:43.110 --> 17:45.350
Oh, shit. That happens.

17:45.612 --> 17:47.459
- His name was Ted.
- Your husband?

17:47.725 --> 17:48.804
His assistant.

17:51.194 --> 17:52.858
- Could be worse.
- Really? How so?

17:53.120 --> 17:55.515
Well, instead of finding out
that your husband was gay,

17:55.655 --> 17:58.272
you could've found out
that he was a...

18:00.341 --> 18:02.689
scientologist or something like that.

18:03.914 --> 18:05.675
I'm a scientologist, Hank.

18:08.812 --> 18:09.976
Or a Nazi.

18:11.846 --> 18:13.153
Or Al Qaeda.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.048
- Keep trying.
- See, this is what I love

18:16.349 --> 18:19.176
- about L.A. is the diversity.
- My bet you do.

18:21.039 --> 18:22.232
<i>The Eagles</i>!

18:24.040 --> 18:25.551
<i>Eagles of Death Metal</i>.

18:25.777 --> 18:27.607
Cool. Right on.

18:28.089 --> 18:30.024
I liked having you here tonight.

18:30.211 --> 18:32.690
Well, I liked being here tonight.

18:33.157 --> 18:34.169
Bullshit.

18:34.358 --> 18:36.736
Oh, it's a pleasure
doing business with you.

18:39.214 --> 18:41.156
I hate to burst your bubble,
sweetie, but...

18:41.296 --> 18:43.667
that movie has nothing to do
with your old man.

18:43.979 --> 18:47.771
Of course it does. Your novel,
while very much
an exercise in nihilism,

18:48.182 --> 18:49.938
is firmly rooted in romanticism.

18:50.608 --> 18:51.847
You read the novel?

18:53.065 --> 18:54.507
Jesus fuck.

19:01.381 --> 19:03.474
You shouldn't take
the Lord's name in vain.

19:03.803 --> 19:06.141
- Where'd you get that old chestnut?
- Bill.

19:06.599 --> 19:08.351
I was wearing
my Cradle of Filth t-shirt.

19:09.001 --> 19:10.953
The one with "Jesus was a C-word"
on the back.

19:11.524 --> 19:12.917
That's my girl.

19:14.579 --> 19:16.100
But I do pray sometimes.

19:16.814 --> 19:17.817
Sort of.

19:18.155 --> 19:19.525
What do you pray for?

19:20.363 --> 19:23.424
That you and mom work out your shit
and we move back to New York.

19:26.467 --> 19:29.293
No, honey. You don't owe me
anything for that one.

19:31.668 --> 19:33.386
Dad?

19:33.574 --> 19:34.898
Are you okay?

19:41.918 --> 19:43.409
But I'm working on it.

19:45.887 --> 19:47.192
Can I get a dog?

19:49.130 --> 19:50.467
Oh, you're good.

19:51.109 --> 19:52.410
You're good.

20:01.050 --> 20:02.290
Son-ja.

20:02.772 --> 20:04.591
Hey, look, I'm sorry about before...

20:04.816 --> 20:07.768
What I said. I don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about half the time.

20:07.908 --> 20:10.469
- Ask anybody. They'll tell you.
- No worries. No worries.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.834
You want to...
You want to get fucked up?

20:23.022 --> 20:24.440
Why are you so smiley?

20:24.656 --> 20:27.550
There's nothing quite like
getting stoned on the very bed

20:27.815 --> 20:30.599
that your ex-domestic partner
shares with her fiancÃ©?

20:32.195 --> 20:33.771
It's the little things.

20:36.462 --> 20:37.789
Could you do me a favor?

20:38.184 --> 20:39.339
Absolutely.

20:45.622 --> 20:46.664
Tell me what you think.

20:51.971 --> 20:52.980
Honestly?

20:53.994 --> 20:55.290
Yeah. Honestly.

20:55.959 --> 20:58.002
I'm, forty-something years old.

20:58.729 --> 21:01.294
I don't have time to play games.
I need to know the truth.

21:06.645 --> 21:08.579
Your breasts are obviously real.

21:10.336 --> 21:12.542
And, um, you have...

21:12.918 --> 21:14.664
an abundance of pubic hair,

21:15.416 --> 21:16.436
which is really nice.

21:18.057 --> 21:19.168
And, um...

21:19.492 --> 21:21.752
there's no evidence
of vaginal rejuvenation.

21:23.825 --> 21:26.309
I'd say aside from the fact
that you worship a space alien,

21:26.449 --> 21:30.459
you just might be the most beautiful
woman I've seen in a long long time...

21:32.901 --> 21:33.924
Thank you.

21:34.882 --> 21:36.121
It's my pleasure.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.685
Would you do mean other favor?

21:42.591 --> 21:43.728
Would you fuck me?

21:44.664 --> 21:47.288
My husband recently left me
for a guy named Ted,

21:47.791 --> 21:49.784
and right now all I wanna do
is get fucked stupid

21:49.914 --> 21:51.417
by a guy who actually likes women.

21:52.322 --> 21:53.478
If that's okay with you.

21:54.732 --> 21:56.542
I'd be lying if I said
I never wondered

21:56.862 --> 21:58.926
what it might be like
to violate a scientologist.

22:01.915 --> 22:04.694
You must be looking like
Art Garfunkel down there lately.

22:06.191 --> 22:07.943
Oh, my god. You're obsessed.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.492
You haven't been in
for a wax in months.

22:11.672 --> 22:14.409
So either you're taking
your lady business elsewhere

22:14.549 --> 22:16.790
or you're sporting
a ginormous hippie bush.

22:16.930 --> 22:19.843
You know what? I hate that shit.
I just came to keep you in business.

22:22.499 --> 22:25.423
And I just want you to be happy
and hair-free.

22:25.803 --> 22:28.113
Well, I am happy.

22:28.620 --> 22:30.239
Thank you very much.

22:32.711 --> 22:34.305
Are you sure you're not making

22:34.567 --> 22:37.057
a deal with the devil
that your ass can't cash?

22:37.498 --> 22:39.098
What does that even mean?

22:41.687 --> 22:42.739
What?

22:45.343 --> 22:46.489
What?

22:46.799 --> 22:49.296
Are you totally serious
about marrying this guy?

22:49.601 --> 22:51.489
Yes. Why?

22:52.147 --> 22:54.175
I love him. He loves me.

22:54.335 --> 22:55.659
He's great with Becca.

22:56.010 --> 22:57.288
I mean, what else is there?

22:57.758 --> 22:58.904
What about Hank?

22:59.646 --> 23:01.007
What about him?

23:01.614 --> 23:04.562
He loves you.
He's trying to get his shit together.

23:04.931 --> 23:07.150
He has been trying
to get his shit together

23:07.290 --> 23:09.015
since the day we first met.

23:10.804 --> 23:14.430
And the sex with Bill?
Is it good?

23:17.144 --> 23:19.031
Yeah. It's different, you know?

23:21.242 --> 23:22.294
Come on.

23:24.548 --> 23:25.962
I want to show you my house.

23:26.102 --> 23:27.534
Oh, my God.

23:28.978 --> 23:30.856
My house is my art.

23:33.955 --> 23:36.946
I don't think Tom and Katie would
approve of what we're doing right now.

23:37.086 --> 23:38.631
Oh, God.
Shut up and fuck me already.

23:38.771 --> 23:39.960
Are you clear yet?

23:40.100 --> 23:42.213
Shut up and fuck me.

23:42.947 --> 23:45.059
You are one kinky thetan.

23:55.114 --> 23:56.119
Are you okay?

24:07.928 --> 24:08.933
Right.

24:22.301 --> 24:23.329
Oh, god.

24:33.337 --> 24:35.567
- My painting.
- It's all good.

24:36.115 --> 24:37.303
We got it under control.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.682
It's all good.

24:45.193 --> 24:47.390
Okay. We're so high!

24:47.530 --> 24:48.986
I don't know what happened.

25:03.003 --> 25:04.336
You look like ass.

25:06.319 --> 25:07.710
Did we just have sex?

25:12.512 --> 25:13.751
What do you want from me?

25:14.559 --> 25:15.817
Isn't it obvious?

25:19.124 --> 25:22.617
What happened the other night
will never, ever happen again.

25:24.563 --> 25:25.878
And why is that?

25:26.241 --> 25:28.176
Because it's sick and wrong.

25:29.355 --> 25:31.932
Well, maybe I'm in the minority here,

25:32.072 --> 25:34.604
but I just don't think
there's anything sick

25:34.744 --> 25:38.213
and wrong about a little fucking
and punching between consenting adults.

25:38.552 --> 25:40.562
You're not an adult, for one.

25:42.116 --> 25:43.628
You dirty old man.

25:46.213 --> 25:47.959
Well, I guess I'll just have to...

25:48.194 --> 25:50.757
get out my vibrator
and read your blog.

25:51.155 --> 25:53.273
That's cool. Then it won't be
a total waste of time.

25:55.110 --> 25:56.462
I thought it was cool.

25:57.110 --> 25:58.399
I was like, "Hey...

25:59.079 --> 26:00.497
"I totally fucked that guy."

26:05.008 --> 26:07.336
- Must be weird, though.
- What?

26:07.841 --> 26:10.527
Becoming the employee of a man
you so clearly hate.

26:11.549 --> 26:12.958
What are you talking about?

26:14.900 --> 26:16.046
My father...

26:16.458 --> 26:18.083
He owns <i>Hell-A Magazine</i>.

26:19.085 --> 26:20.193
Mia, is that you?

26:21.758 --> 26:23.047
Coming, daddy.

26:37.791 --> 26:39.281
Always a pleasure.
