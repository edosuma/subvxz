02:24.027 --> 02:25.221
Son of a bitch.

03:03.499 --> 03:06.832
Anyway, the cop is sitting there,
sipping his coffee, you see?

03:06.903 --> 03:09.895
And he's scratching his head.
He's completely confused by now.

03:09.973 --> 03:12.806
- He says to the drunk...
- How's it going, Philo?

03:12.876 --> 03:15.367
..."What about the guy
in bed with your wife?"

03:15.445 --> 03:19.404
And the drunk says, "The hell with him.
Let him make his own coffee."

03:22.118 --> 03:24.382
You get it?
"Let him make his own coffee."

03:24.687 --> 03:26.587
Excuse me.

03:28.057 --> 03:30.389
That's funny,
but don't give up your day job.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.950
Come on, Big Al.

03:33.429 --> 03:36.398
Let's have some fun.
You want to go some place?

03:38.034 --> 03:41.003
- Hey, Big Al. Are you married?
- I used to be.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.964
I know this place in the valley.
We could go get a couple drinks.

03:46.042 --> 03:49.739
Lots of action there. Great fun.
What do you say?

03:49.812 --> 03:51.677
Hey. Put them back.

03:53.549 --> 03:56.416
- You talking to me?
- This ain't the Salvation Army.

03:56.519 --> 03:57.747
Put them back.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.549
I got plenty of peanuts, Big Al.

04:00.423 --> 04:02.721
- You mean these?
- Yeah, asshole.

04:03.760 --> 04:08.459
- Unless you're taking them to your tree.
- Shit. Excuse me, gents.

04:09.933 --> 04:13.130
The squirrel is taking his peanuts
up to his tree.

04:16.039 --> 04:19.600
The squirrel is ripping off peanuts,
ain't you, squirrel?

04:21.476 --> 04:23.445
Going to take them up to your tree?

04:32.655 --> 04:33.747
All right.

04:34.157 --> 04:37.149
- Come on, guys. Knock it off.
- Get him!

04:37.226 --> 04:38.284
Attaboy!

04:38.361 --> 04:40.625
- Come on, get out of here, you guys.
- Get him.

04:42.832 --> 04:44.527
Outside. Come on, guys.

04:47.337 --> 04:48.395
Outside!

05:34.684 --> 05:36.549
Hey, Orville, what's doing?

05:37.587 --> 05:39.248
Ma's going to try it again.

05:53.569 --> 05:55.867
I should have remembered my wig.

05:57.507 --> 05:59.702
You think it'll make any difference?

06:00.910 --> 06:02.639
I don't know, Ma.

06:03.679 --> 06:06.705
I don't expect
that's all they're going to be looking at.

06:22.198 --> 06:24.826
Don't be in such a fired, big hurry.

06:24.901 --> 06:27.836
I want to look at these pictures
one time more.

06:27.937 --> 06:31.600
I always did have trouble
with these squiggly lines.

06:32.175 --> 06:35.542
I hope you pass it this time, Ma,
because there ain't too many more...

06:35.611 --> 06:38.341
...of these places we can go to.
They all know you.

06:38.714 --> 06:42.616
They don't know how I drive.
Don't none of them know how good I drive.

06:43.019 --> 06:46.455
Been driving since
before them sons of bitches were born.

06:46.556 --> 06:48.615
Come on, get out.

08:02.698 --> 08:03.756
Here.

08:05.768 --> 08:08.134
You're getting pretty tricky, Clyde.

08:08.938 --> 08:10.838
You've done real good, Ma.

08:11.674 --> 08:12.663
Meathead.

08:12.742 --> 08:16.838
Waited till I passed the whole test
before he tells me I'm too old.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.643
I should have remembered my wig.

08:22.084 --> 08:27.681
The hell with everybody.
Come on, get going, for God's sake.

08:28.891 --> 08:31.519
- Philo, are you out here?
- No, I ain't.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.390
What are you doing?
Are you working on the car?

08:36.631 --> 08:40.363
Orville, that's two dumb questions
in a row you've asked me.

08:40.669 --> 08:41.659
Here.

08:42.071 --> 08:44.938
Help me put that block under the car here.

08:45.841 --> 08:47.638
- This one here?
- Yeah.

08:48.711 --> 08:51.305
You want it under the wheel
or under the spring?

08:51.380 --> 08:52.870
Under the spring.

08:54.550 --> 08:56.040
There you go.

09:00.823 --> 09:01.949
- Thanks.
- Sure.

09:02.592 --> 09:05.254
Ma's pissed. It's Clyde.

09:05.394 --> 09:08.955
He got out this morning, came over,
and shit all over everything.

09:09.432 --> 09:11.161
How did she get him back?

09:11.834 --> 09:15.361
That's what she's pissed about.
She had to bribe him with all her Oreos.

09:16.939 --> 09:18.531
Well, I'll make it up to her.

09:19.475 --> 09:22.308
- You got one going tomorrow?
- Yeah, you coming?

09:23.179 --> 09:24.009
Sure am.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.279
Who wants some action around here?

09:27.350 --> 09:29.511
- There you go, my man. What's the name?
- $40.

09:29.585 --> 09:31.052
- Name?
- John Hatfield.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.588
I got you, my man. Thank you. Who else?

09:33.990 --> 09:36.288
How much you want?
Quick, talk to me, my man.

09:36.359 --> 09:38.759
- Give me $80.
- $80. Let me see that.

09:39.428 --> 09:40.554
- Name?
- Jackson.

09:40.630 --> 09:44.396
All right, listen, I've got $100.
Who wants to make a side-bet, here?

09:44.467 --> 09:45.900
Come on, guys. Talk up!

09:45.968 --> 09:48.368
He may be good,
but he ain't no Tank Murdock.

09:49.839 --> 09:50.828
Take it.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.005
- We won't have anything...
- Take it.

09:54.076 --> 09:54.940
You're on.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.909
- Who's gonna hold this?
- You hold it.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.286
No problem, you're fine.

10:05.721 --> 10:07.348
Church, let's go, man.

10:13.229 --> 10:14.457
You got him.

10:16.399 --> 10:19.596
- Come up here, Clyde. There you go.
- Put this bum away!

10:19.669 --> 10:23.036
Don't waste any time on the guy,
just put him away.

10:26.642 --> 10:28.439
Put him away now, Church!

10:33.416 --> 10:34.405
Put him away.

11:52.928 --> 11:56.295
Thank you. $5, $100 and $200...

11:56.365 --> 11:58.094
...$500, $600, $900 <i>...</i>

12:01.036 --> 12:03.004
Clyde could have beat him.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.899
I kind of like this.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.570
That one's a redhead.

13:10.639 --> 13:13.130
- I'll take the one on the left.
- All right.

13:14.343 --> 13:16.709
The one stuffing her face with chowder.

13:18.147 --> 13:20.843
Let's go over there
and see what she's drinking.

13:23.953 --> 13:24.942
Hi.

13:25.955 --> 13:29.186
My name's Philo.
Do you mind if I sit here for a while?

13:29.558 --> 13:30.820
Suit yourself.

13:31.660 --> 13:33.958
I don't recall seeing you around here.

13:34.430 --> 13:36.227
I've never been here before.

13:37.166 --> 13:39.430
Where do you go when you're not here?

13:40.002 --> 13:44.166
My name is Carol. I go to USC.
I major in sociology.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.607
I'm here because I'm doing a paper
on the country-western mentality.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.071
Well, that just blew five minutes
of our conversation.

13:53.148 --> 13:56.709
Well, you asked if you could sit.
You didn't say nothing about talking.

13:56.785 --> 13:58.309
Who are you mad at?

13:59.121 --> 14:02.557
- I don't suppose you have a light, do you?
- No, I don't smoke.

14:03.559 --> 14:04.958
Excuse me.

14:09.131 --> 14:10.325
Orville.

14:37.426 --> 14:40.486
Tell me, just what is
the country-western mentality?

14:41.096 --> 14:43.792
Well, if the lyrics of this song
are any indication...

14:43.866 --> 14:47.427
...it's somewhere between moron
and dull-normal.

14:49.605 --> 14:51.402
Oh, my <i>...</i> Jesus Christ.

14:52.041 --> 14:54.134
You are disgusting.

14:55.277 --> 14:57.142
Let's leave. Go.

14:58.347 --> 14:59.575
What happened?

15:01.116 --> 15:04.745
This wild clam got out of control. Take it.

15:09.491 --> 15:10.958
Did you see her face?

15:11.026 --> 15:15.087
You could've put a turd in there and
she couldn't gotten a better look on her.

15:18.601 --> 15:19.727
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

15:19.802 --> 15:24.296
<i>Now, would you all put your hands</i>
<i>together and keep the applause going?</i>

15:24.440 --> 15:27.204
<i>Let's all give a big,</i>
<i>big Palomino welcome...</i>

15:27.476 --> 15:30.468
<i>... to pretty Miss Lynn Halsey...</i>

15:31.447 --> 15:32.345
<i>... Taylor.</i>

15:44.426 --> 15:47.020
<i>Thank you. Okay. Ready, boys?</i>

16:27.803 --> 16:29.395
Let's get out of here.

16:30.205 --> 16:32.571
I want to watch this chick for a minute.

17:52.821 --> 17:56.917
<i>That's awful nice. Lynn Halsey...</i>

17:57.993 --> 18:00.518
<i>... Taylor.</i>
<i>You can come back anytime, honey.</i>

18:01.296 --> 18:03.787
Excuse me.
Could I put this back there for a while?

18:03.866 --> 18:05.527
- Sure can.
- Thank you.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.435
- You sure sing pretty.
- Well, thank you.

18:08.737 --> 18:11.171
I'd really be pleased
if I could buy you a drink.

18:11.807 --> 18:12.933
Sure.

18:13.308 --> 18:16.038
- I'd like a beer.
- Two of those.

18:22.151 --> 18:25.552
I didn't get your name in the introduction.
My name's Philo Beddoe.

18:25.621 --> 18:29.113
Lynn Halsey-Taylor.
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?

18:30.559 --> 18:34.825
- She sure ran out pretty fast.
- Oh, her. I hardly knew her a minute.

18:35.564 --> 18:36.963
A minute?

18:37.099 --> 18:40.899
Well, you must go through
a lot of women like that.

18:43.105 --> 18:46.802
- That was a nice song. Did you write that?
- No. Wish I did.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.969
Just a song my daddy used to sing to me
when I was little.

18:50.078 --> 18:53.343
When you were little?
That's where I know you from.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.950
When I was in third grade
I knew a girl that looked enough like you...

18:57.019 --> 18:59.146
...it makes my memory water.

19:01.089 --> 19:02.681
You sure do talk funny.

19:07.663 --> 19:09.494
Kind of smoky in here.

19:09.998 --> 19:12.796
- Would you like to...
- I'd love to.

19:25.447 --> 19:28.473
Say, it's kind of smoky in here.

19:32.354 --> 19:36.017
So, I decided there was nothing
I liked doing better than singing.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.889
- So, here I am.
- Am I glad.

19:40.963 --> 19:43.796
Row 3. That's my lucky number.

19:47.069 --> 19:48.536
I'll tell you what:

19:50.739 --> 19:52.366
You're my lucky number.

19:57.412 --> 19:58.902
Would you like to...

20:00.215 --> 20:02.308
...have me in for a while, maybe?

20:03.352 --> 20:04.683
I'd love to.

20:05.387 --> 20:06.979
- Only...
- Only?

20:07.990 --> 20:11.426
- Only my boyfriend, Schyler, is sleeping.
- Boyfriend?

20:12.027 --> 20:15.121
- He wouldn't mind.
- He wouldn't?

20:16.732 --> 20:19.462
So long as you don't drive his car.

20:21.370 --> 20:25.170
Well, I think maybe we could make it
some other time when he ain't around.

20:27.342 --> 20:30.072
Okay. Whatever you say.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.147
Slightly advanced.

20:50.933 --> 20:52.298
Look, man, it's an ape!

20:55.037 --> 20:56.902
Yeah. Which one's the ape?

20:58.707 --> 21:03.337
- What did you say?
- That looks your girlfriend.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.037
Hey, buddy.
Are you taking your mother for a ride?

21:11.386 --> 21:13.786
- Take that up there, baby.
- Hey.

21:13.855 --> 21:17.484
- So long, apeshit.
- Son of a bitch.

22:02.270 --> 22:03.532
What the hell's this?

22:09.711 --> 22:11.201
We'll get them, right, boy?

22:29.331 --> 22:31.526
Clyde, get your hands off the wheel.

22:32.100 --> 22:36.264
- Let's get the hell out of here. He's crazy.
- Follow me.

22:47.215 --> 22:50.776
- Hey, why did you come in here?
- He'll never find us in here.

22:51.053 --> 22:52.782
Get those things out of here.

23:00.062 --> 23:01.359
Roll up your window.

23:04.499 --> 23:05.488
Shit!

23:17.512 --> 23:19.412
Get them out of here. Freaks!

23:50.612 --> 23:53.240
Hey, man, what in the hell is going on?

24:08.196 --> 24:11.825
- Do you think we ought to stop and fight?
- Nope.

24:13.168 --> 24:15.068
Let's catch that train.

24:50.872 --> 24:52.271
Take it easy.

24:53.675 --> 24:54.733
It's a monkey.

25:15.830 --> 25:16.819
Crazy monkey!

25:22.170 --> 25:24.468
Are you okay? Thanks, Clyde.

25:34.716 --> 25:37.549
If you don't like him,
how come you stay with him?

25:37.819 --> 25:40.583
Because he promised
to help me get the $7,000.

25:40.889 --> 25:42.083
"Best I can"

25:42.157 --> 25:44.625
- For what?
- "It's hard for me to say no

25:44.693 --> 25:46.752
"to a truck drivin' man"

25:46.962 --> 25:48.520
For the down payment.

25:48.897 --> 25:52.958
- What do you want to buy?
- "Cadillac that I still don't have the time

25:53.168 --> 25:57.901
"Keep the fool who wants to marry me
dangling on my line"

25:58.540 --> 26:00.974
My own club back home in Denver.

26:01.343 --> 26:04.471
I'm going to call it
the Lynn Halsey-Taylor Drinking Fountain.

26:04.546 --> 26:08.676
"Hard for me to say no
to a truck driving man"

26:08.750 --> 26:13.483
That will be the name of my group, too.
I'll have talent night three nights a week.

26:15.423 --> 26:17.914
How much of the $7,000
do you have already?

26:18.827 --> 26:20.454
He won't tell me.

26:21.830 --> 26:25.061
Well, about the only thing
of any value I've got is Clyde.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.494
- Clyde?
- Yeah, he's my ape.

26:28.870 --> 26:31.771
- I won him in a fight.
- You won him?

26:33.642 --> 26:34.574
Yeah.

26:35.377 --> 26:37.607
They brought him over here
to make a baby.

26:37.679 --> 26:40.147
- You mean he's from Africa?
- No, he's from Sumatra.

26:40.315 --> 26:44.445
When he got here, the other male orang
they had on hand had already done the job.

26:44.519 --> 26:45.543
You're kidding?

26:45.620 --> 26:49.454
Yeah, so Clyde got real mean as hell,
so they sold him to a desert zoo.

26:49.524 --> 26:52.755
- Desert zoo?
- One of those places out in the desert...

26:52.827 --> 26:57.696
...says, "Real, live dragon, cactus candy,
five miles ahead," that sort of thing.

26:58.600 --> 27:02.764
That's where I won him.
I bet my truck and two dirt bikes on him.

27:03.538 --> 27:07.872
- You must have wanted him a lot.
- I really hated to see him in that cage.

27:09.110 --> 27:12.079
- So, who'd you fight for him?
- These four guys.

27:12.314 --> 27:13.645
Four guys?

27:14.049 --> 27:17.610
You would have thought after
the first couple lost they'd have given up.

27:17.686 --> 27:21.645
- Well, I fought all four at once.
- All four at once?

27:22.590 --> 27:26.026
- You like to fight?
- I used to. Better than anything.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.191
Well, almost anything.

27:29.964 --> 27:32.228
So, why didn't you turn professional?

27:33.435 --> 27:35.665
None of that stuff. There's too many rules.

27:36.604 --> 27:39.095
You're just a regular Tank Murdock.

27:40.575 --> 27:43.203
- You know him?
- I know of him.

27:43.545 --> 27:46.036
He's from Denver
and he's a regular institution.

27:46.114 --> 27:47.604
You bet he is.

27:47.682 --> 27:50.617
Now that is one guy
I'd like to meet up with.

27:51.286 --> 27:54.187
Well, I'd really like to meet Clyde.

27:57.258 --> 27:59.783
And you will. You will.

28:00.362 --> 28:03.661
Right now we'll meet my friend, Orville.
He's waiting on us.

28:05.166 --> 28:09.000
So, Tank was in the back seat of this car
with this debutante.

28:09.070 --> 28:11.095
I mean, her daddy owned the whole town.

28:11.840 --> 28:15.469
- And his buddy was in the trunk.
- And then what happened?

28:15.777 --> 28:18.143
Well, you see, she was so pure...

28:18.213 --> 28:22.081
...that nobody believed these wild stories
that Tank had been telling about her.

28:22.150 --> 28:25.347
- What happened?
- You got to use your imagination, Orville.

28:28.323 --> 28:29.483
Anyway, after...

28:29.557 --> 28:33.755
...she heard all this bumping around
and laughing coming from the trunk.

28:33.828 --> 28:35.352
And she started to scream.

28:35.563 --> 28:38.532
So, all these cops came in,
six or eight of them.

28:38.600 --> 28:42.366
Tank tried to explain, but nobody
believed him because they all knew him.

28:42.437 --> 28:47.238
He must have put four cops in the hospital.
It took about 12 of them to take him in.

28:48.777 --> 28:49.471
Man.

28:49.544 --> 28:52.069
- One thing I want to know about the story.
- What?

28:52.147 --> 28:54.513
Who let that poor guy out of the trunk?

28:56.351 --> 28:58.080
Shit, he's probably still there.

29:01.489 --> 29:04.515
Those two creeps over there
asked me to bring this to the lady.

29:23.878 --> 29:25.709
This was mighty nice of you.

29:28.616 --> 29:31.312
- Do you see that?
- An arm?

29:32.720 --> 29:34.119
No, that.

29:35.890 --> 29:37.152
A tattoo?

29:40.995 --> 29:43.020
They don't know what this means.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.123
Do you see that?

29:48.703 --> 29:51.069
- Sorry.
- Two tattoos.

29:52.474 --> 29:54.908
Them's black widows.

29:56.244 --> 30:00.340
Did you know that more people die
from black widows than rattlers each year?

30:00.415 --> 30:02.883
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

30:03.651 --> 30:06.882
Well, listen, I sure do appreciate
knowing that because...

30:06.988 --> 30:11.049
...most of the people I know
just step on them and squish them.

30:11.125 --> 30:12.717
I don't need this cheap shit.

30:12.794 --> 30:16.491
Orville, that's no way to thank two guys
that just bought us a beer.

30:16.798 --> 30:20.996
Why don't you get the check and
I'll go outside and thank them properly?

30:27.809 --> 30:29.071
Okay.

30:30.345 --> 30:32.472
- Go ahead.
- You started it.

30:38.286 --> 30:39.719
Shouldn't you go with him?

30:52.200 --> 30:54.100
Sure is good pecan pie.

31:08.016 --> 31:10.211
I think we'd better get out of here.

31:43.384 --> 31:44.817
Cut it out, Clyde.

31:50.892 --> 31:52.985
Ma, what'd you do that for?

31:53.628 --> 31:57.291
Been trying to get your attention
for five minutes.

31:57.465 --> 31:58.989
Did you see Orville?

32:00.168 --> 32:04.104
- Yeah. I saw him.
- Well? Orville tell you what?

32:05.239 --> 32:08.470
Yeah, and I'm sorry, Ma,
about you missing your driver's test again.

32:08.543 --> 32:10.977
That ain't the one what I mean.

32:12.213 --> 32:13.271
You mean Clyde?

32:16.618 --> 32:19.849
I'm sorry about that too, Ma.
He won't do it again, I promise.

32:19.921 --> 32:23.288
- What are you gonna do about it?
- What? The crap or the Oreos?

32:23.925 --> 32:26.359
About Clyde! Goddamn it!

32:26.427 --> 32:29.487
I don't have no privacy
in my own home no more.

32:29.864 --> 32:34.198
Well, I confronted him about it, Ma.
I guarantee it won't happen again.

32:34.802 --> 32:37.566
No privacy in your own home.

32:38.006 --> 32:42.443
A whole goddamn bag of Oreos.

32:49.951 --> 32:54.354
Stop that, you goddamn baboon.
No respect. No privacy.

32:55.156 --> 32:56.521
No nothing.

33:00.928 --> 33:02.156
Bang.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.474
- You're late, pretty boy.
- Shut up.

33:16.944 --> 33:18.969
I don't believe this.

33:20.148 --> 33:21.137
Damn.

33:21.616 --> 33:25.074
I never knew nobody
who could hit so hard or so fast.

33:25.787 --> 33:28.347
- He could've been Denver Tank Murdock.
- That's right.

33:28.756 --> 33:30.553
- Sound like him?
- Don't know.

33:30.625 --> 33:33.321
Didn't get to see him so close as Elmo.

33:34.595 --> 33:37.291
At least I didn't drop my bike and run.

33:37.932 --> 33:40.264
Like you two! You big suckers!

33:40.935 --> 33:41.765
Shut up!

33:44.272 --> 33:45.762
Now, it isn't bad enough...

33:45.840 --> 33:48.240
...that you let somebody else
kick your butts...

33:48.309 --> 33:50.937
...without you trying to do it to each other.

33:53.548 --> 33:57.644
If we're all talking about the same man...

33:58.786 --> 34:00.686
...and I think we are...

34:03.391 --> 34:07.157
...then it appears he's got
a rather growing collection of our bikes.

34:07.228 --> 34:10.391
Yeah, but we don't know for sure
if he took them or not.

34:10.665 --> 34:13.828
- We were...
- Unconscious for two hours!

34:14.168 --> 34:16.329
- Sick son of a bitch.
- It's not true!

34:16.938 --> 34:18.371
Shut up!

34:23.244 --> 34:25.542
The very first thing we do...

34:26.013 --> 34:28.641
...is find out who we're talking about.

34:29.684 --> 34:32.619
I mean,
we don't even know where to find him.

34:33.154 --> 34:34.951
How are we going to find him?

34:40.154 --> 34:44.284
Well, it appears to me
that there can't be too many guys...

34:44.659 --> 34:47.389
...driving around this valley with an ape.

34:50.498 --> 34:53.695
- What you got sticking out here?
- Open it.

34:55.203 --> 34:57.433
- It sure feels heavy.
- Open it.

34:59.874 --> 35:04.174
- Philo. God, where'd you get this?
- Off a couple little old widows.

35:04.679 --> 35:06.112
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

35:06.180 --> 35:10.674
More people are dying to buy widow bikes
than are dying by rattler bites every year.

35:15.356 --> 35:16.050
Well.

35:17.692 --> 35:20.718
- You like it?
- Well, yeah.

35:22.497 --> 35:23.521
That I do.

35:25.466 --> 35:27.627
Wait until Clyde sees you in this outfit.

35:32.740 --> 35:35.174
- What's the matter?
- I'm okay.

35:37.111 --> 35:40.308
- House not too good tonight?
- I'm okay, Philo.

36:03.805 --> 36:06.706
Well, at least this outfit you bought me
was a big hit.

36:11.913 --> 36:13.972
I don't like the way this guy's driving.

36:34.001 --> 36:35.059
Get down!

36:52.520 --> 36:54.010
Is that somebody you know?

36:56.123 --> 36:56.953
Schyler.

36:57.859 --> 37:02.023
- I thought you said he didn't care.
- He must have changed his mind.

37:17.912 --> 37:19.812
Philo, I'm scared.

37:20.381 --> 37:23.646
- I won't let anything happen to you.
- That's not what I'm afraid of.

37:23.718 --> 37:26.243
I'm afraid for Schyler.
Please don't hurt him.

37:26.420 --> 37:29.617
He tried to shoot me
and didn't care that you were next to me.

37:29.690 --> 37:32.591
That's just it.
He was just trying to scare you.

37:32.660 --> 37:34.491
He doesn't even know how to shoot.

37:34.562 --> 37:37.030
I sure don't like
the way he's trying to find out.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.698
Philo, I know him.
He's probably in there now...

37:39.767 --> 37:41.826
...hiding, scared out of his wits.

37:42.670 --> 37:44.194
I don't like to see you cry.

37:46.107 --> 37:48.075
Let me talk to him. Please.

37:49.143 --> 37:50.132
I don't know.

37:51.112 --> 37:53.774
Please. For me. Please.

37:56.317 --> 37:57.944
All right. You talk to him.

37:58.319 --> 38:00.787
And you tell him that I want you
to come with me...

38:00.855 --> 38:03.085
...and I want you to stay with me,
you hear?

38:03.624 --> 38:04.488
Philo.

38:06.827 --> 38:09.387
Here. I want you to dry those tears.

38:10.064 --> 38:13.659
- I want you to take this. It's the dough.
- I couldn't take that.

38:13.734 --> 38:16.225
Yes, you can.
I want you to have it now, you hear?

38:17.238 --> 38:19.934
- Okay.
- I don't want you to cry no more.

38:39.727 --> 38:44.255
Clyde, how'd you get out?
What, did you pull the lock off?

38:45.299 --> 38:46.561
How'd you get out?

38:47.602 --> 38:51.265
No, you don't. Come on. No, you don't.

38:51.539 --> 38:53.302
Give me that! Give me it!

39:00.114 --> 39:01.206
What?

39:02.149 --> 39:04.379
Good Clyde.

39:06.420 --> 39:08.115
Just hold that truck up, Clyde.

39:09.890 --> 39:11.323
What are you doing, Clyde?

39:11.392 --> 39:12.882
- Philo.
- Yeah.

39:13.527 --> 39:17.088
Call this son of a <i>...</i> No, don't call him.

39:18.399 --> 39:20.697
Don't call him. Good Clyde.

39:21.302 --> 39:23.634
That's it, Clyde. Hold it up.

39:35.583 --> 39:37.312
How many times have I told you?

39:37.385 --> 39:40.320
I don't want him drinking beer,
except on Saturday night.

39:58.239 --> 40:03.506
- Don't expect I'll need these no more.
- Take it easy, Ma. This is the easy part.

40:05.713 --> 40:10.412
Awful glad there ain't no more
of them squiggly pictures.

40:12.353 --> 40:14.446
Good. Maybe you'll do it this time.

40:14.522 --> 40:17.218
Maybe. Well, I guess I will.

40:20.628 --> 40:22.926
Why didn't you tell him you wear glasses?

40:23.831 --> 40:27.232
It's none of his goddamn business
what I wear.

40:28.002 --> 40:30.368
Just wear them to read, anyway.

40:31.706 --> 40:33.173
Was there anything else?

40:35.242 --> 40:37.107
Told me I was too old.

40:37.445 --> 40:40.005
Meathead! Orville.

40:40.881 --> 40:42.143
Yes, Mother?

40:42.783 --> 40:46.514
- Next time I'll wear my glasses.
- Good.

40:48.923 --> 40:50.049
Goddamn it.

40:58.399 --> 41:00.196
God, you're a handsome devil.

41:06.540 --> 41:10.203
Clyde, you're going to meet a lady now.
I want you to handle it.

41:10.845 --> 41:15.509
That means no spitting, pissing,
farting or picking your ass.

41:15.916 --> 41:20.717
You hear me? Because if you do,
I'll throttle you. Understand?

41:35.703 --> 41:37.432
Man, I'll tell you something.

41:38.205 --> 41:41.470
Clyde, this has got to stop.
People are going to talk, you know?

42:16.610 --> 42:19.943
- What is it?
- That trailer that was parked down there.

42:20.014 --> 42:21.208
What happened to it?

42:21.282 --> 42:23.307
- What spot?
- That spot right over there.

42:23.384 --> 42:24.408
I don't see it.

42:24.485 --> 42:26.282
- Well, where'd it go?
- It's gone.

42:26.554 --> 42:29.045
I know it's gone, goddamn it,
but where'd it go?

42:29.323 --> 42:31.223
- Back home, I suppose.
- Denver?

42:32.059 --> 42:35.028
Some folks
just don't take me into their confidence.

42:35.095 --> 42:37.529
The plates said Colorado.
Sound right to you?

42:37.832 --> 42:40.096
- When'd they leave?
- This morning.

42:40.534 --> 42:41.364
Thanks.

42:44.038 --> 42:45.300
Goodbye, now.

42:54.582 --> 42:56.675
Hey, Philo. I've got a message for you.

43:12.032 --> 43:14.398
Why don't you watch
what the hell you're doing?

43:14.768 --> 43:16.759
Why don't you shut your face, boy?

43:17.471 --> 43:21.464
What have we got here?
A real, live, macho cowboy.

43:21.942 --> 43:23.239
Don't turn your back.

44:13.127 --> 44:15.595
- Somebody call the cops.
- They are the cops.

44:18.966 --> 44:19.933
Shit.

44:23.837 --> 44:26.670
- She didn't say where she was going?
- Nope.

44:27.174 --> 44:29.642
- Well, how do you know where to look?
- I'll know.

44:30.044 --> 44:33.104
Well, how do you know
she wants you to come looking for her?

44:33.414 --> 44:36.110
There you go
asking those dumb questions again.

44:37.718 --> 44:39.686
- Is Clyde going?
- Yes.

44:42.456 --> 44:44.515
- You got room for one more?
- Yes.

44:44.591 --> 44:45.387
Got you!

44:46.927 --> 44:47.916
I'm coming.

44:49.430 --> 44:51.523
- Which way are we headed?
- East.

44:51.932 --> 44:53.263
Sounds reasonable.

44:53.334 --> 44:56.565
East? What are you gonna do
with the baboon?

44:57.705 --> 45:00.299
Orangutan, Ma. Clyde's an orangutan.

45:00.474 --> 45:03.841
- What's the difference?
- He has 12 ribs, just like you and me.

45:03.911 --> 45:07.312
- What are you going to do with him?
- He's coming with me. Come on.

45:07.381 --> 45:09.542
Well, when are you coming back?

45:10.751 --> 45:13.948
- When are you coming back?
- Whenever it's time, Ma.

45:16.023 --> 45:19.686
It don't seem right
to leave an old lady alone.

45:19.760 --> 45:22.695
And what about my goddamn license?

45:24.865 --> 45:26.833
This is <i>...</i> It's just <i>...</i>

45:27.101 --> 45:30.628
Twelve ribs.
I don't believe any of that shit!

45:31.772 --> 45:33.603
This machine is very sensitive.

45:34.508 --> 45:36.408
What do you think you'll find here?

45:36.477 --> 45:39.446
You never know what you'll find here.
Just listen.

45:40.014 --> 45:41.777
It picks up all kinds of metal.

45:41.882 --> 45:47.320
Swiss watches, expensive foreign cameras,
silver dollars. Gold, man.

45:49.690 --> 45:51.089
- Gold?
- Yeah.

46:03.804 --> 46:06.204
- Herb.
- Yeah.

46:07.074 --> 46:09.542
What are we going to do
about that son of a bitch?

46:09.610 --> 46:12.579
- Who?
- You know who I'm talking about.

46:12.780 --> 46:14.611
That cowboy at the Palomino Club.

46:14.948 --> 46:17.815
I don't know what you can do about him.
What can we do, man?

46:18.085 --> 46:21.384
You mean to stand there and tell me
you'd let him get away with it?

46:23.791 --> 46:25.383
You got anything in mind?

46:25.692 --> 46:28.752
What I got in mind is
to break his stupid head.

46:35.803 --> 46:40.240
- Listen, are you sure that thing works?
- Sure it works. Just keep digging.

46:42.042 --> 46:44.374
Besides, you don't even know
where to find him.

46:44.445 --> 46:46.913
Don't worry. I'll find him.

46:48.515 --> 46:49.504
I got a plan.

46:49.716 --> 46:52.913
- What's that?
- I'm going to use my medical leave.

46:54.688 --> 46:56.155
What are you laughing at?

46:56.223 --> 46:59.386
You're going to spend your two weeks
medical leave looking for him?

47:00.427 --> 47:03.521
I'll spend the next two years
looking for him if I have to.

47:05.032 --> 47:06.659
- What's up?
- Pit stop.

47:15.943 --> 47:18.377
- Are these cantaloupes fresh?
- Yes.

47:18.445 --> 47:21.346
- Are they today's?
- Yes. They just came in.

47:23.884 --> 47:26.250
No, I only want a quarter of a pound.

47:27.187 --> 47:29.018
These only cost a quarter a pound.

47:29.089 --> 47:32.616
I only want a quarter of a pound
of tomatoes.

47:35.129 --> 47:37.063
Yes, ma'am. Right.

47:38.599 --> 47:40.692
Can I have a fresh bag now?

47:46.640 --> 47:49.734
I'll take these two cantaloupes.
How much are they a pound?

47:50.577 --> 47:52.636
Cantaloupes are 29 cents a pound.

47:52.713 --> 47:56.672
I think they were cheaper down the road.
I don't know why you're so expensive here.

47:56.750 --> 47:57.580
Ma'am.

48:10.030 --> 48:13.124
- Can you help me out?
- Sure.

48:13.901 --> 48:15.732
- What's your name?
- Echo.

48:16.470 --> 48:17.266
Echo.

48:20.107 --> 48:21.699
Do you want some cantaloupes?

48:25.379 --> 48:27.006
Those are beautiful.

48:28.916 --> 48:31.646
Thank you. How many would you like?

48:33.687 --> 48:35.154
Do you live around here?

48:36.757 --> 48:39.317
Yeah. Down past the wash.

48:41.528 --> 48:42.722
Where's the wash?

48:44.164 --> 48:46.325
How come you want to know
so much about me?

48:47.634 --> 48:51.195
Because I never met anyone
that made me feel like you do.

48:52.072 --> 48:53.471
Right out of the gate.

48:58.912 --> 49:00.880
- Where are you headed?
- East.

49:57.571 --> 49:59.903
- What's your name?
- Echo.

50:00.107 --> 50:01.836
- What?
- Echo.

50:05.279 --> 50:06.246
Orville.

50:08.682 --> 50:12.118
What did you say, anyway,
that made that woman storm away?

50:16.456 --> 50:18.219
I told her you had the clap.

50:50.190 --> 50:51.748
All right, spread out.

50:52.759 --> 50:56.957
- Hey, heifer, how's the slop?
- Suits the clientele real good.

50:57.130 --> 50:58.290
Looking real good.

50:59.599 --> 51:01.863
Don't you got no special of the day?

51:02.269 --> 51:05.432
Liver and onions.
Why don't you read the menu?

51:06.073 --> 51:08.268
Maybe I'd rather talk to you.

51:09.309 --> 51:11.903
Has Philo Beddoe been around?

51:12.379 --> 51:17.282
You want to talk, take a walk.
You want to eat, take a seat.

51:21.421 --> 51:23.446
What are you laughing at? Lard-ass!

51:26.126 --> 51:27.525
I'll tell you what:

51:28.195 --> 51:32.188
Turn around and walk out that door,
and I'll forget what you said.

51:33.734 --> 51:36.794
And I won't tell everybody
that you drink horse piss.

51:38.538 --> 51:41.803
- Elmo, Cholla, did you hear what he said?
- I heard it.

51:43.276 --> 51:47.076
- I'll just keep this warm for you, Lester.
- Okay, big mouth, let's go.

51:47.681 --> 51:50.149
You want me to keep a piece
of that lemon meringue?

51:50.217 --> 51:53.345
Yeah, this won't take but a minute.
Let's go, cutes.

51:58.825 --> 52:01.055
Drinking horse piss. What is this?

52:01.928 --> 52:04.488
- Hey, come on!
- Get him, come on!

52:07.033 --> 52:08.625
Kick him in the nuts.

52:37.497 --> 52:38.862
Kick him in the shins.

52:51.411 --> 52:55.177
Come on over here. Give me a hand.
Where you going? Get back here.

52:56.416 --> 52:59.476
That's it.
Get this little son of a gun right there.

53:00.420 --> 53:01.182
Good.

53:14.534 --> 53:16.331
Hurry up. Get out of there, Roy.

53:17.704 --> 53:18.602
Look out.

53:23.443 --> 53:24.569
My God.

53:33.520 --> 53:34.714
Spread out!

53:39.860 --> 53:42.124
Goddamn morphadites.

53:46.333 --> 53:48.597
Come on.
Get the hell out of the way. Hurry.

53:52.372 --> 53:53.361
Let's go.

53:56.977 --> 53:57.966
Move it.

54:28.208 --> 54:30.768
- Who is it?
- The police.

54:32.612 --> 54:36.309
I'm coming. I'm coming, goddamn it!

54:36.950 --> 54:39.009
What do you want with an old lady?

54:39.085 --> 54:43.021
Ma'am, we're looking for Philo Beddoe.
Our records say he lives at this address.

54:43.890 --> 54:45.653
Well, your records are wrong.

54:46.159 --> 54:49.993
He lives at that address in the back.
What do you want him for?

54:50.130 --> 54:53.930
- Just looking for him, ma'am.
- Well, he don't live there anymore.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.959
He's gone off.
Took that son of a bitch, Clyde, with him.

54:58.038 --> 54:58.800
Clyde?

55:00.540 --> 55:01.700
His ape.

55:02.542 --> 55:03.531
His ape?

55:04.110 --> 55:07.443
You heard me.
What you making me repeat myself for?

55:08.081 --> 55:10.049
Do you know where he's gone?

55:10.450 --> 55:14.716
Who gives a damn? Stealing all my Oreos.

55:15.188 --> 55:19.955
Crapping all over the place.
Twelve ribs, my ass!

55:20.961 --> 55:23.191
- Thank you. Sorry to bother you.
- Yeah.

55:23.263 --> 55:25.254
I'm sorry, too, you see.

55:25.365 --> 55:28.528
Leave an old lady alone, fending for herself.

55:28.902 --> 55:30.563
No protection.

55:30.637 --> 55:32.434
It just don't seem <i>...</i>

55:34.507 --> 55:37.806
Well, I don't suppose you know
of a ladies' room hereabouts?

55:38.678 --> 55:39.838
They're all over.

55:41.581 --> 55:42.878
Just pick one.

55:53.893 --> 55:56.691
- She's something, ain't she?
- She sure is.

55:57.631 --> 56:00.259
You're full of all kinds
of surprises these days.

56:03.503 --> 56:08.031
Listen, I want to say that I appreciate
your making her feel at home.

56:14.347 --> 56:15.314
Clyde.

56:18.184 --> 56:21.312
There's something out there!
God, it's horrible! It's a monster.

56:21.521 --> 56:26.652
- It's not even a bear. It's a <i>...</i>
- No, Echo, it's just Clyde.

56:28.161 --> 56:31.653
Hey, Echo! Wait. Give me <i>...</i> What?

56:33.533 --> 56:36.024
Take it easy. You're going to scare him.

56:36.970 --> 56:39.438
- Me, scare him?
- That's right.

56:39.973 --> 56:42.703
Let me introduce you. Echo, this is Clyde.

56:42.776 --> 56:45.404
Clyde, this is Echo. Echo.

56:47.213 --> 56:48.339
Did you get it?

56:53.820 --> 56:55.754
It's okay. See?

57:11.071 --> 57:14.165
- Hey, granny, how they hanging?
- Hey, hot damn.

57:15.075 --> 57:19.171
- What are you doing tonight, honey?
- Let her alone. She's mine. I saw her first.

57:32.792 --> 57:37.627
- Say, old lady. Where's Philo Beddoe?
- How the hell do I know?

57:38.331 --> 57:42.734
Get off my porch with that thing.
Get off my property!

57:43.536 --> 57:45.800
You're not very hospitable.

57:46.473 --> 57:51.137
Hospitable, my ass. Get off my porch!

57:53.446 --> 57:56.574
Very well. If you insist.

58:18.338 --> 58:21.466
All right, lady. Put that gun down!

58:22.375 --> 58:25.037
I'm warning you, lady.
Put down that gun, now!

59:15.995 --> 59:17.428
Wait for me!

59:18.464 --> 59:19.761
First, the police.

59:20.400 --> 59:25.201
I told those boys not to leave
a vulnerable old lady all alone.

59:26.105 --> 59:28.801
Hospitable? Horseshit!

59:29.943 --> 59:31.911
- Police.
- Yeah?

59:32.045 --> 59:35.606
I want to ask you questions about a girl.
Her name was Lynn Halslay-Taylor.

59:35.882 --> 59:36.871
Halsey.

59:37.817 --> 59:39.978
Yeah. She was here, but she left.

01:00:09.983 --> 01:00:12.611
Hey, man.
How come that cat ain't moving?

01:00:12.719 --> 01:00:14.209
You think he's dead?

01:00:14.487 --> 01:00:19.618
Shit, man, if he's the only one here,
let's have some fun.

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.352
Shut up!

01:00:22.228 --> 01:00:24.162
But he's only one old man.

01:00:24.597 --> 01:00:27.794
It was only one old woman
that nearly ruinated all of you.

01:00:28.368 --> 01:00:29.460
Yeah.

01:00:32.372 --> 01:00:33.839
Maybe we ought to split.

01:00:40.914 --> 01:00:42.211
Hello, there.

01:00:46.819 --> 01:00:47.843
You in there?

01:00:51.324 --> 01:00:54.657
What is it?
What the hell are you doing here?

01:00:55.728 --> 01:00:59.687
Well, I'm looking for a girl
that used to stay around here.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.635
- She was with a guy named Philo Beddoe.
- Don't know no Philo Beddoe.

01:01:06.339 --> 01:01:09.797
Well, the girl's name was Halsey-Taylor.
Lynn Halsey-Taylor.

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:13.836
She must've been one jim-dandy of a girl.

01:01:14.314 --> 01:01:18.216
You're the third one come to ask about her
since she left for Denver.

01:01:18.918 --> 01:01:21.216
- You don't say.
- Yeah.

01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:36.155
- Could I put that back there?
- Sure, doll. It'll be here when you need it.

01:02:41.434 --> 01:02:43.368
- Buy you a drink?
- Sure.

01:02:47.707 --> 01:02:48.833
Taste that, too.

01:02:50.143 --> 01:02:50.837
Here.

01:02:51.144 --> 01:02:52.736
Get out of my stuff, Clyde.

01:02:53.946 --> 01:02:56.506
Here, take a piece of this. That's my salad.

01:02:57.784 --> 01:03:01.811
Why don't you two take the truck?
Clyde and I are going to go check around.

01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:06.438
- What's going on?
- Orville, you've got to get up.

01:06:06.505 --> 01:06:09.941
- Why?
- Because it just isn't right, that's why.

01:06:10.042 --> 01:06:12.135
- What isn't right?
- What isn't right?

01:06:12.612 --> 01:06:14.910
It just ain't right. I mean <i>...</i>

01:06:16.682 --> 01:06:19.708
I mean, you two have somebody.
And I've almost got somebody.

01:06:19.785 --> 01:06:21.218
And it just ain't right.

01:06:21.787 --> 01:06:25.314
- Well, what isn't right about it?
- You just don't understand, do you?

01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:28.785
Yeah. He just doesn't understand.

01:06:28.861 --> 01:06:31.659
Right, and that's why
we've got to do something about it.

01:06:31.731 --> 01:06:32.493
We do?

01:06:33.532 --> 01:06:36.126
Yeah. Here. Off your ass and on your feet.

01:06:38.871 --> 01:06:43.069
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about Clyde, damn it.

01:06:44.577 --> 01:06:46.306
You think he doesn't understand.

01:06:46.879 --> 01:06:50.838
He sits back there all the time. You don't
think he understands, but he's smart.

01:06:52.418 --> 01:06:54.409
And I'll tell you something, Orville.

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:58.181
He thinks about a lot of things
besides Oreo cookies.

01:07:02.395 --> 01:07:03.657
Right, Clyde?

01:07:06.399 --> 01:07:09.698
- You don't mean <i>...</i>
- I mean exactly that.

01:07:12.305 --> 01:07:16.173
Where the hell are we going to get
Clyde laid in the middle of the night?

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:25.142
Shit.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:29.488
How the hell do you break into a zoo?

01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:32.315
It's easy.
Zoos are meant to keep everybody in.

01:07:32.958 --> 01:07:35.688
Listen to that.
He knows something good will happen.

01:07:36.095 --> 01:07:38.723
Well, how do you know there's a lady
in there for him?

01:07:38.964 --> 01:07:40.898
I don't, but if there is one there...

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.959
...and he doesn't find it, he wouldn't know
what to do, anyway. Give me a hand.

01:07:49.642 --> 01:07:50.631
Come on.

01:07:52.511 --> 01:07:54.411
Well, what do you want us to do?

01:08:00.353 --> 01:08:04.221
The place is probably guarded, so I want
you to stay here and keep an eye out.

01:08:10.496 --> 01:08:11.485
Come on, pal.

01:08:14.066 --> 01:08:15.556
Okay. All right, Clyde.

01:08:16.368 --> 01:08:17.358
Up.

01:08:18.604 --> 01:08:22.335
Boy, I bet there's a gal in there.
Think there's a lady in there?

01:08:24.076 --> 01:08:25.134
You bet, man.

01:08:26.412 --> 01:08:28.538
Clyde, you think there's a lady in there?

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.546
Come on. Clyde.

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:15.957
Orville.

01:09:18.163 --> 01:09:21.156
When we get to this next town,
you should drum up some action.

01:09:21.267 --> 01:09:23.497
We're getting a little short on cash.

01:09:25.004 --> 01:09:26.265
Sure, why not.

01:09:30.676 --> 01:09:33.201
Do you know where
the meat-packing plant is?

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:37.608
- No. But I'll find it.
- All right, I'll see you there.

01:09:37.683 --> 01:09:38.741
You got it.

01:10:01.807 --> 01:10:05.072
I don't care much
for that perfume they're wearing.

01:10:05.778 --> 01:10:08.269
- Do they know me here?
- No, it's even money.

01:10:08.848 --> 01:10:12.841
- Anything else?
- Yeah. Guy's name is Kincaid.

01:10:12.918 --> 01:10:17.218
He's a local champion. Taller than you.
About 240 pounds. I checked.

01:10:18.591 --> 01:10:21.992
- And?
- They say he stacks up to Tank Murdock.

01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:24.696
Tank Murdock?

01:10:25.264 --> 01:10:29.200
You know, like them all, Tank's gonna fall.
And another thing, he fights dirty.

01:10:29.935 --> 01:10:32.028
- Orville Boggs?
- You got it.

01:10:32.538 --> 01:10:34.301
Okay, open the gate.

01:10:35.608 --> 01:10:37.542
It's over there in the cold room.

01:10:46.585 --> 01:10:48.485
- How much you want?
- What you got?

01:10:48.721 --> 01:10:51.019
- $1,200.
- We'll take it.

01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:54.086
You've got to show me something
besides conversation.

01:10:57.496 --> 01:11:00.329
- I'll take that.
- All right, if I see yours.

01:11:04.603 --> 01:11:06.662
What do you want us to do with the body?

01:11:06.739 --> 01:11:09.731
Save your breath.
It's enough you'll lose your money.

01:11:11.043 --> 01:11:12.840
- Hey, man.
- Hey, baby!

01:11:13.546 --> 01:11:14.706
What's up?

01:11:32.331 --> 01:11:33.355
I want you.

01:12:11.837 --> 01:12:13.600
Come on, Philo, put him away!

01:12:16.742 --> 01:12:18.471
Don't let him tag you!

01:12:42.534 --> 01:12:46.527
What the hell are you doing, Philo?
It's getting cold in here!

01:13:43.395 --> 01:13:46.296
- I think you owe us some money.
- What money?

01:13:47.766 --> 01:13:48.858
Wait a minute.

01:13:48.934 --> 01:13:52.529
You aren't gonna tell all these boys
that you'll take their money, are you?

01:13:59.545 --> 01:14:02.571
That was just so you'd know
the first one was no accident.

01:14:21.767 --> 01:14:25.498
Did you see this little filly shoot?
Where did you ever learn to do that?

01:14:25.604 --> 01:14:28.072
You could shoot a gnat off a buffalo's ass.

01:14:28.307 --> 01:14:31.333
- I told you I could take care of myself.
- She took care of us.

01:14:33.312 --> 01:14:35.507
<i>Car 103.</i>

01:14:35.581 --> 01:14:38.744
<i>Proceed to the intersection</i>
<i>of Interstate 5 and Velasquez Road...</i>

01:14:38.984 --> 01:14:40.281
<i>... for a 602.</i>

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.511
<i>103 here. Got you, over.</i>

01:14:46.558 --> 01:14:49.220
That 602's the same as our 406.

01:14:50.129 --> 01:14:54.088
No way. It's got to be the same
as our 309 or at the best our 213.

01:14:54.533 --> 01:14:55.522
You're crazy.

01:14:56.668 --> 01:15:00.331
No New Mexican 602
can come anywhere near California 309.

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.838
When's the last time
you been out on a 309?

01:15:03.909 --> 01:15:05.604
Maybe three or four months.

01:15:07.179 --> 01:15:11.138
But it don't mean that I don't know
that our 309 ain't more than their 602.

01:15:13.185 --> 01:15:15.380
- What time you got?
- 6:07.

01:15:15.821 --> 01:15:18.756
<i>Unit 103, abort that 602, 103.</i>

01:15:18.824 --> 01:15:22.521
<i>Proceed to Velasquez Road</i>
<i>on Interstate 5 for a 607.</i>

01:15:32.671 --> 01:15:35.697
Well, kiss my <i>...</i>

01:15:52.858 --> 01:15:56.385
I suppose you think I'm crazy
traipsing across the country...

01:15:56.461 --> 01:15:58.952
...after a girl I hardly even know.

01:15:59.498 --> 01:16:01.056
Hell, I'm not like Orville.

01:16:01.133 --> 01:16:03.397
It takes me a long time
to get to know a girl.

01:16:04.469 --> 01:16:07.029
Even longer to let her know me.

01:16:08.073 --> 01:16:09.734
You know what I mean?

01:16:14.913 --> 01:16:19.179
I'm not afraid of any man,
but sharing my feelings with a woman...

01:16:21.453 --> 01:16:24.013
...my stomach just turns to royal gelatin.

01:16:24.623 --> 01:16:27.057
I don't suppose that ever happens to you.

01:16:29.494 --> 01:16:33.988
I guess you just keep howling
until sometime they howl back.

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:49.304
If this is a strike,
it means Ronstadt and Parton move over.

01:16:49.448 --> 01:16:51.678
It's Halsey-Taylor to the top.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.596
It's okay. It just means
it's going to take a little longer.

01:17:07.466 --> 01:17:09.457
But we don't give up.

01:17:14.773 --> 01:17:16.764
If I get this pickup...

01:17:17.476 --> 01:17:19.944
...it means the same time next year...

01:17:20.012 --> 01:17:22.412
...Halsey-Taylor has her own special.

01:17:38.563 --> 01:17:40.793
That was a mighty fine pickup, little lady.

01:17:41.833 --> 01:17:43.733
Thank you.

01:17:54.947 --> 01:17:57.882
Will you mind Clyde for me?
I'm going to take a run.

01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:58.939
All right.

01:18:32.284 --> 01:18:33.546
Shit!

01:18:36.755 --> 01:18:39.155
Hey, Lynn! Wait up!

01:18:44.463 --> 01:18:45.930
Fancy meeting you here.

01:18:46.231 --> 01:18:48.563
Incredible is more like it.
What are you doing?

01:18:48.967 --> 01:18:50.195
Following you.

01:18:52.237 --> 01:18:54.102
You picked me up just in time.

01:18:54.373 --> 01:18:56.000
All this weather.

01:18:56.875 --> 01:18:59.708
You took off so fast
I thought there was something wrong.

01:19:00.612 --> 01:19:02.204
Bad time to run.

01:19:02.514 --> 01:19:04.505
I figured maybe I'd better follow you.

01:19:05.183 --> 01:19:06.582
Thought you'd better, huh?

01:19:08.186 --> 01:19:10.677
Hell, you didn't even get a chance
to meet Clyde.

01:20:13.218 --> 01:20:15.243
Pull in right here.

01:20:24.329 --> 01:20:28.732
I know where he keeps the money now,
so it's a matter of finding the right time.

01:20:29.201 --> 01:20:31.101
I still say my way would be quicker.

01:20:31.169 --> 01:20:32.636
Philo, you promised.

01:20:32.704 --> 01:20:37.368
Please don't make me sorry I told you.
You make me afraid to believe you.

01:20:37.442 --> 01:20:39.637
I never want to make you sorry.

01:20:43.782 --> 01:20:46.114
You want to come down
and meet everybody?

01:20:46.184 --> 01:20:50.143
No, I'd better go back.
We'll do it when we have more time.

01:20:50.222 --> 01:20:53.589
Tomorrow night? Like we agreed?
El Patio Restaurant.

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:56.058
Philo?

01:20:58.029 --> 01:20:59.462
You're really something.

01:21:24.289 --> 01:21:25.756
Jesus Christ.

01:21:26.258 --> 01:21:30.592
Goddamn, I don't believe what I'm seeing.
I think I'm still asleep and dreaming.

01:21:30.662 --> 01:21:33.153
You're not dreaming. Come on.
Get your ass up.

01:21:33.331 --> 01:21:35.265
Hi, Clyde. How you doing?

01:21:37.435 --> 01:21:39.062
Let's let the little lady up.

01:21:43.408 --> 01:21:45.342
What did you do that for?

01:21:46.278 --> 01:21:48.803
I think he's trying to tell us something.

01:21:48.947 --> 01:21:51.074
What's he trying to tell us?

01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:54.680
Why are you so all fired happy, Philo?

01:21:54.753 --> 01:21:58.280
Listen, the only time
I ever see you smiling is when <i>...</i>

01:22:00.492 --> 01:22:01.959
You got laid?

01:22:02.427 --> 01:22:05.521
You were jogging,
and you picked up somebody and laid her.

01:22:05.897 --> 01:22:08.127
- Did he?
- I'll do you one better than that.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:12.027
- You mean Clyde got laid again, too?
- No. I ran into Lynn Halsey-Taylor.

01:22:12.571 --> 01:22:14.232
How'd you do that?

01:22:14.406 --> 01:22:16.966
I was running down the highway
and she picked me up.

01:22:17.042 --> 01:22:18.873
- Where is she now?
- She's in town.

01:22:18.944 --> 01:22:21.469
She's getting things straightened up,
we'll see her.

01:22:21.546 --> 01:22:25.107
Goddamn, that is good news.
That means we can go home soon.

01:22:27.252 --> 01:22:28.617
I don't see why not.

01:22:29.087 --> 01:22:32.250
While we're waiting around
for true romance...

01:22:32.324 --> 01:22:34.588
...I think I'll jump down and get some flies.

01:22:34.659 --> 01:22:37.526
There's no way I don't want
to get in on this action.

01:22:38.763 --> 01:22:41.061
- Help me finish these first, will you?
- Right.

01:22:42.667 --> 01:22:45.795
Did you ever notice how drinking
and fishing kind of go together?

01:22:45.971 --> 01:22:48.201
- You sell fishing licenses in here?
- Sure do.

01:22:48.273 --> 01:22:50.468
Something about the six-pack
and the worms.

01:22:50.542 --> 01:22:53.841
- Any good trout around here?
- About four or five miles down the road.

01:22:54.913 --> 01:22:56.107
Orville.

01:22:57.482 --> 01:23:01.111
Don't these look like the humpers
Clyde was eating this morning?

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.579
Are these the flies Philo wanted?

01:23:04.656 --> 01:23:05.748
Grayish yellow.

01:23:31.683 --> 01:23:33.981
Hey, Philo. Where's your boat?

01:23:35.086 --> 01:23:36.986
I'm going to hang out here on shore.

01:23:39.357 --> 01:23:43.123
Echo and I are going on down
to the other end here.

01:23:45.096 --> 01:23:46.893
- We got him?
- Got him.

01:23:52.504 --> 01:23:54.301
Here. Be careful, it's loaded.

01:23:56.508 --> 01:23:57.805
Why the scattergun?

01:23:57.976 --> 01:24:01.036
- Because I don't want to miss that sucker.
- Makes sense.

01:24:01.746 --> 01:24:02.838
Here.

01:24:06.618 --> 01:24:08.085
Why all the fishing gear?

01:24:08.153 --> 01:24:11.145
Because we got to look
like we're going fishing, dummy.

01:24:11.723 --> 01:24:13.953
Now look, I'll go right through there.

01:24:14.459 --> 01:24:16.825
You go around the lake
and come from behind him.

01:24:18.296 --> 01:24:19.820
I'm going around this lake...

01:24:19.898 --> 01:24:22.867
Damn it. Not so loud.
He'll hear you. It's not so far.

01:24:23.535 --> 01:24:26.766
And here. Get going.

01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:33.877
Now get going, will you?

01:24:52.364 --> 01:24:53.626
Stinking hippie.

01:24:58.069 --> 01:24:59.536
Quite a mess of fish.

01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:06.534
Shit.

01:25:13.551 --> 01:25:16.452
The white boy's
the craziest son of a bitch in the world.

01:25:16.588 --> 01:25:18.579
Where in the hell is that Putnam?

01:25:22.193 --> 01:25:23.626
What are you doing, boy?

01:25:25.730 --> 01:25:26.526
My God!

01:25:29.067 --> 01:25:30.091
Feet!

01:25:30.802 --> 01:25:33.270
Feet don't fail me now, man.

01:25:43.782 --> 01:25:47.479
Goddamn apes, snakes, alligators and shit!

01:25:58.496 --> 01:26:01.727
You so much as blink,
and I'll blow a big hole in you.

01:26:01.833 --> 01:26:03.357
Who are you and what do you want?

01:26:03.435 --> 01:26:05.869
Just never you mind.
You'll find out soon enough.

01:26:06.504 --> 01:26:07.869
What the hell was that?

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.008
- Jesus.
- Good Lord.

01:26:11.776 --> 01:26:13.539
He must be 5 or 6 pounds.

01:26:13.611 --> 01:26:16.273
Give him some slack.
Don't jerk, you'll lose him!

01:26:17.649 --> 01:26:18.911
God, he's a monster.

01:26:21.386 --> 01:26:23.013
Don't jerk him!

01:26:23.321 --> 01:26:25.152
Give me that rod!

01:26:26.758 --> 01:26:29.022
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

01:26:32.464 --> 01:26:34.056
He's a monster!

01:26:34.833 --> 01:26:36.494
He's a frigging monster!

01:26:37.502 --> 01:26:39.834
I've never seen anything like it before.

01:26:40.004 --> 01:26:42.598
He must weigh 25 pounds.

01:26:43.541 --> 01:26:46.374
He's a stud! He's got to be a stud!

01:26:46.444 --> 01:26:48.412
Come on, help me here.

01:26:51.583 --> 01:26:53.244
Boy, he is a stud!

01:26:58.122 --> 01:27:00.147
- Have a stud.
- Shit!

01:27:26.818 --> 01:27:27.876
Putnam!

01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:30.351
Big, dumb galoot.

01:27:35.894 --> 01:27:37.486
Putnam, where are you?

01:27:38.096 --> 01:27:39.085
Dummy.

01:27:52.977 --> 01:27:54.205
What was that?

01:27:54.279 --> 01:27:56.611
I think he's spending too much time
with Clyde.

01:28:42.627 --> 01:28:44.925
What are we supposed to do
with all this stuff?

01:28:44.996 --> 01:28:46.463
Eat it. All of it.

01:28:50.134 --> 01:28:51.999
- "All of it"?
- All of it.

01:28:54.572 --> 01:28:55.937
What if I can't?

01:28:57.075 --> 01:28:58.667
Then we'll give it to Clyde.

01:28:59.243 --> 01:29:02.303
Can you imagine what this would do
to Clyde's digestive tract?

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:04.780
He already has enough gas
to go to North Denver.

01:29:04.849 --> 01:29:07.181
And he's never seen a bean in his life.

01:29:10.888 --> 01:29:13.083
Say, when's your little lady coming here?

01:29:14.292 --> 01:29:16.089
She should be along any time.

01:29:24.802 --> 01:29:27.236
Let's get out of here.

01:29:31.876 --> 01:29:34.845
Listen, Philo.
Does that mean we're going back to L.A.?

01:29:35.079 --> 01:29:37.775
Hell, no. But when I find her...

01:29:38.583 --> 01:29:41.552
...l'll take care of that guy she's with.
My way.

01:29:48.092 --> 01:29:52.620
Hey, an Airstream!
Hey, Cholla! That's the one!

01:30:10.415 --> 01:30:11.575
Howdy.

01:30:21.259 --> 01:30:23.625
I bet you're Lynn Halsey-Taylor, ain't you?

01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:27.498
Now how'd you know that?

01:30:27.932 --> 01:30:30.765
Well, we been following you,
all the way from Los Angeles.

01:30:32.503 --> 01:30:34.266
You see me sing at the Palomino?

01:30:35.006 --> 01:30:39.670
I'm sorry to say, I missed that,
but I promise not to miss it next time.

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:46.148
Well, then, what did all you boys follow me
all the way to Colorado for?

01:30:46.818 --> 01:30:49.719
Do you know a guy named Philo?
Philo Beddoe?

01:30:50.655 --> 01:30:52.122
He's been following you.

01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:53.687
You know that?

01:30:54.358 --> 01:30:55.689
Yeah, I know that.

01:30:56.194 --> 01:30:57.684
Is he a friend of yours?

01:30:58.296 --> 01:30:59.729
Not particularly.

01:31:00.231 --> 01:31:01.858
You want to find him?

01:31:02.467 --> 01:31:03.695
Not particularly.

01:31:04.469 --> 01:31:05.299
We do.

01:31:28.326 --> 01:31:30.157
Now, that's a nice looking truck.

01:31:32.063 --> 01:31:33.724
There she is.

01:31:37.368 --> 01:31:39.700
You stay here. This is personal.

01:31:53.484 --> 01:31:54.644
Lynn!

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.810
You Philo Beddoe?

01:32:01.159 --> 01:32:02.387
Do I know you?

01:32:03.227 --> 01:32:04.592
You're going to.

01:32:24.982 --> 01:32:28.145
Last time I saw you two,
you were going for a fast freight.

01:32:28.319 --> 01:32:31.584
The last time we saw you,
you were dirt-diving in an alfalfa patch.

01:32:33.758 --> 01:32:34.816
Philo Beddoe.

01:32:36.761 --> 01:32:38.023
Your time has come.

01:32:45.570 --> 01:32:47.003
Here we go again.

01:34:30.141 --> 01:34:31.130
I got him.

01:34:35.112 --> 01:34:37.444
The bikes, you dummies! The bikes!

01:34:38.482 --> 01:34:39.506
The bikes!

01:34:48.826 --> 01:34:50.691
Are those guys coming after me?

01:34:51.128 --> 01:34:53.153
Those guys are coming after me!

01:35:03.207 --> 01:35:04.435
I'll get him!

01:35:17.722 --> 01:35:20.088
I'm going to kill you all!

01:35:26.163 --> 01:35:26.959
Look out!

01:35:27.832 --> 01:35:29.265
Watch out for the truck!

01:35:32.970 --> 01:35:35.996
Hi, cutie pie. Want a ride?

01:35:36.907 --> 01:35:38.670
- Don't mind if I do.
- Hop in.

01:35:40.611 --> 01:35:44.069
Darling, I'm only glad you happened along
when you did.

01:35:44.849 --> 01:35:46.248
Nice day for a drive.

01:35:56.794 --> 01:35:59.661
- Look at these guys coming up the road.
- I love this.

01:36:01.766 --> 01:36:03.393
Ten points.

01:36:04.268 --> 01:36:05.997
Get out of the way!

01:36:08.739 --> 01:36:09.865
There's the boy.

01:36:34.365 --> 01:36:37.334
- Thanks.
- Make sure that door's closed, would you?

01:36:48.079 --> 01:36:50.946
Let's go get a bite to eat.

01:36:51.082 --> 01:36:54.051
No, you go on ahead.
Clyde and me will eat later.

01:36:55.052 --> 01:36:57.612
We'll bring you back something,
okay, Philo?

01:36:58.556 --> 01:36:59.352
Whatever.

01:36:59.623 --> 01:37:03.684
He's locked into that phone book.
He must have called every place in town.

01:37:04.628 --> 01:37:06.220
What are you hungry for?

01:37:18.609 --> 01:37:21.908
Are you sure you don't want me
to go in there and just hang out?

01:37:22.012 --> 01:37:25.448
- He pulled a shotgun last time.
- This is personal. I'll handle it.

01:37:25.616 --> 01:37:29.313
Why don't Echo and I just go in
and have a beer and listen to the music?

01:37:29.553 --> 01:37:33.649
- Do you want to borrow my pea shooter?
- Thanks. You two go have a good time.

01:37:33.724 --> 01:37:36.386
See if you can find out the location
of Tank Murdock.

01:38:08.659 --> 01:38:11.651
- What will you have?
- A beer.

01:38:52.236 --> 01:38:55.205
<i>Lynn Halsey-Taylor, everybody.</i>

01:38:56.740 --> 01:39:00.870
<i>All right!</i>
<i>It's great to have you back in Denver, Lynn.</i>

01:39:02.413 --> 01:39:06.850
<i>And now, everybody,</i>
<i>the featured performer of the evening...</i>

01:39:07.551 --> 01:39:11.351
<i>... the star of tonight's show,</i>
<i>Mr. Charlie Rich.</i>

01:39:16.894 --> 01:39:21.194
The best club out there is the Palomino,
and the manager's a good friend.

01:39:21.265 --> 01:39:23.733
So, I'll write him,
tell him to give you a spot.

01:39:23.801 --> 01:39:25.598
That's mighty nice of you.

01:40:03.607 --> 01:40:04.869
Like me?

01:40:08.345 --> 01:40:09.710
Want me?

01:40:10.314 --> 01:40:11.747
- Let's go.
- Harlan.

01:40:12.783 --> 01:40:15.718
I've got a friend. It's okay, though.

01:40:16.587 --> 01:40:19.681
He won't mind,
he just might want to come along.

01:40:22.359 --> 01:40:23.621
Let's go.

01:40:40.577 --> 01:40:42.306
- Is this your...
- No.

01:40:47.284 --> 01:40:50.082
You want to talk to him?

01:40:50.821 --> 01:40:54.222
The lady and I have a little business.
I expect you'll be excusing us.

01:40:57.127 --> 01:40:59.891
Maybe you ought to excuse yourself.

01:41:00.130 --> 01:41:02.928
It's okay, Harlan, I'll just be a minute.

01:41:04.601 --> 01:41:06.068
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:41:16.413 --> 01:41:19.644
It's your own goddamn fault!
Who asked you to follow me?

01:41:20.184 --> 01:41:21.913
- I just thought...
- You thought!

01:41:22.152 --> 01:41:25.212
If you'd thought,
you would've taken some very broad hints.

01:41:25.589 --> 01:41:29.491
I've been trying to get rid of you practically
ever since the first night we met.

01:41:30.961 --> 01:41:33.054
- What about Taos?
- What about it?

01:41:33.697 --> 01:41:35.597
I need it just like anybody else.

01:41:37.067 --> 01:41:40.696
- You do this all the time.
- I do this all the time.

01:41:40.938 --> 01:41:44.567
And you and me had our time,
so why don't you know when to disappear?

01:41:44.775 --> 01:41:47.300
- Come here.
- Take your hands off me!

01:41:47.778 --> 01:41:49.712
Lynn? Is everything all right?

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:54.317
Schyler, this is the one from L.A.
The big, dumb one I told you about.

01:41:58.489 --> 01:41:59.956
Schyler, with the shotgun?

01:42:00.023 --> 01:42:03.015
That was my idea.
I was hoping he'd scare you away.

01:42:03.761 --> 01:42:05.626
Why didn't you just say goodbye?

01:42:05.696 --> 01:42:07.186
You're here, aren't you?

01:42:07.264 --> 01:42:09.698
Guys like you don't understand goodbye.

01:42:15.072 --> 01:42:17.040
What do you do? You hustle for him?

01:42:18.976 --> 01:42:20.910
You're just not too smart, are you?

01:42:21.111 --> 01:42:24.342
Why did you have to come?
Why couldn't you quit like everybody else?

01:42:24.415 --> 01:42:27.145
You had to come chasing me
and spoil it all.

01:42:28.719 --> 01:42:31.313
I guess I'm just not too smart, that's all.

01:42:31.488 --> 01:42:35.390
Up to now, I'm the only one dumb enough
to want to take you further than your bed.

01:42:38.529 --> 01:42:39.621
I hate you!

01:42:44.535 --> 01:42:45.695
I hate you.

01:42:58.382 --> 01:42:59.872
I hate you.

01:43:16.834 --> 01:43:19.667
Well, listen,
do you want to rest up a little bit?

01:43:19.803 --> 01:43:22.704
- You don't have to take him tonight.
- No, that's fine.

01:43:25.108 --> 01:43:27.133
- Are you Philo Beddoe?
- That's right.

01:43:28.645 --> 01:43:30.476
Keep on walking, you'll see him.

01:43:30.547 --> 01:43:33.516
- Here you go.
- Is that all the money?

01:43:33.717 --> 01:43:36.083
- What's with the girl?
- Don't worry about it.

01:43:36.186 --> 01:43:38.416
What do you mean, "Don't worry about it"?

01:43:43.527 --> 01:43:45.256
Right to your left.

01:44:22.533 --> 01:44:25.366
Don't worry about it, Philo.
This guy's a real porker.

01:44:30.574 --> 01:44:33.566
He's carrying his reputation
around his waist.

01:44:55.232 --> 01:44:57.427
Looks like you've had a go at it already.

01:44:58.402 --> 01:45:00.893
You sure that face won't hurt
too much to fight?

01:45:01.939 --> 01:45:05.773
- I ain't going to hit you with my face.
- That's funny.

01:45:06.243 --> 01:45:07.608
I like you.

01:45:08.045 --> 01:45:12.982
Don't worry, we'll get this over
in a hurry and take care of you.

01:45:15.352 --> 01:45:18.150
Where did you hear
of Tank Murdock before, kid?

01:45:18.722 --> 01:45:20.417
- All around.
- Yeah?

01:45:20.624 --> 01:45:22.956
- They say you're the best.
- They do?

01:45:26.263 --> 01:45:28.356
Well, let's get with it.

01:46:32.329 --> 01:46:33.956
Jesus Christ, who is that guy?

01:46:34.031 --> 01:46:36.829
I don't know,
but he's the one that'll beat Tank Murdock.

01:46:39.569 --> 01:46:42.834
Come on, Tank! Come on, get him!

01:47:10.167 --> 01:47:12.727
Jesus Christ,
that guy's going to beat Tank Murdock!

01:47:12.803 --> 01:47:13.997
Get up! Come on!

01:47:27.851 --> 01:47:29.842
This guy will be the new Tank Murdock!

01:47:34.224 --> 01:47:36.192
- This is it for Tank!
- Who is this guy?

01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:38.355
The new guy's beaten Tank!

01:47:55.812 --> 01:47:57.939
You has-been! You ought to learn to box!

01:47:59.683 --> 01:48:01.514
You old bum! You're all washed up!

01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:17.295
That guy's the new Tank Murdock.

01:48:21.037 --> 01:48:23.028
We're going to make money on this guy.

01:48:33.617 --> 01:48:35.380
My champ!

01:49:05.182 --> 01:49:07.377
"5, Z."

01:49:08.718 --> 01:49:12.017
Just a minute there, now. "B."

01:49:13.623 --> 01:49:17.218
Why don't you try that one
with your glasses on?

01:49:19.362 --> 01:49:23.492
Yes. Why didn't I think of that?

01:49:25.635 --> 01:49:29.036
- There. Now try it again.
- Thank you, I will.

01:49:29.339 --> 01:49:31.102
"5, Z, B, D, F."

01:49:31.174 --> 01:49:33.039
- You did it.
- Of course I did.

01:49:33.243 --> 01:49:36.041
Now, if you'd please step over there
for your photograph.

01:49:37.714 --> 01:49:39.739
- My what?
- Your photograph.

01:49:40.116 --> 01:49:41.583
To put on your license.

01:49:42.819 --> 01:49:44.411
My photograph.

01:49:44.521 --> 01:49:48.287
Well, what will they think of next?

01:49:55.031 --> 01:49:57.158
I think I forgot my comb.

01:49:57.634 --> 01:50:00.933
Don't you worry.
Your hair looks quite lovely.

01:50:02.138 --> 01:50:04.038
Do you really think so?

01:50:10.213 --> 01:50:13.080
All right, you ready?
Let me get you focused.

01:50:13.216 --> 01:50:15.616
All right, now smile. Big smile.
