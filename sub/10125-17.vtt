WEBVTT

00:13.400 --> 00:14.500
MATTHEWS!

00:14.500 --> 00:15.767
WHAT'S WITH THE CAMERA?

00:15.767 --> 00:18.400
MR. WILLIAMS SAYS A NEWSMAN
ALWAYS HAS HIS CAMERA READY.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.367
MIND IF I
KEEP ON SHOOTING?

00:20.367 --> 00:21.467
NO. GO AHEAD.

00:21.467 --> 00:22.700
ALL RIGHT!

00:23.767 --> 00:24.867
HEY!

00:24.867 --> 00:27.600
TURN THAT THING OFF,
I'LL LET YOU BACK IN.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.300
COME ON.
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?

00:30.300 --> 00:32.800
MY DISDAIN FOR YOU.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.300
SHAWN, SHAWN--

00:35.300 --> 00:36.300
ON THE PHONE, COR.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.400
DAD, HOW WILL YOU
CELEBRATE YOUR BIRTHDAY?

00:39.400 --> 00:40.734
THAT'S GREAT.

00:40.734 --> 00:44.133
HE'S GOING
TO THE DOG TRACK
WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON.

00:44.133 --> 00:47.200
SO, YOU
COMING HOME SOON?

00:47.200 --> 00:49.300
YEAH.
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.133
OH, WELL,
I REALLY MISS YOU.

00:52.133 --> 00:53.467
WHERE'S SHAWN'S DAD
CALLING FROM?

00:53.467 --> 00:57.500
HE SAID ABOARD
<i>AIR FORCE ONE,  </i>
BUT I DOUBT IT.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.300
I HEARD PEOPLE
YELLING IN SPANISH.

01:00.300 --> 01:03.200
I'M GLAD TO HEAR
YOU'RE DOING SO WELL.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.567
WHAT? OH, YOU GOT TO GO?

01:05.567 --> 01:07.700
THE PRESIDENT
NEEDS THE PHONE.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.867
YELTSIN'S
ON CALL-WAITING.

01:10.934 --> 01:13.500
O.K., WELL,
I CAN'T WAIT TO--

01:13.500 --> 01:15.000
HELLO?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.400
HELLO?

01:17.800 --> 01:21.200
DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO SING HIM
<i>HAPPY BIRTHDAY. </i>

01:21.200 --> 01:22.367
YOU MISS HIM, HUH?

01:22.367 --> 01:24.934
FAMILY'S
REALLY IMPORTANT
TO THE HUNTERS.

01:24.934 --> 01:26.300
MY DAD ALWAYS SAID,

01:26.300 --> 01:30.600
"WHERE THERE'S FAMILY,
THERE'S A PLACE
TO HIDE."

01:30.600 --> 01:31.734
DID HE SAY WHEN
HE'S COMING BACK?

01:31.734 --> 01:35.467
NO. I BET
IT'D MAKE HIM
REALLY HAPPY

01:35.467 --> 01:38.133
TO SEE HOW WELL
I'M DOING.

01:38.133 --> 01:39.400
WELL, HE CAN.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:40.667 --> 01:42.767
MATTHEWS CAN
PUT YOU ON TAPE.

01:42.767 --> 01:45.667
WE CAN GO DOWN
TO YOUR OLD TRAILER PARK

01:45.667 --> 01:47.700
AND GET
ALL YOUR RELATIVES.

01:47.700 --> 01:48.934
I'LL SHOOT IT.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.567
SHAWN,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

01:50.567 --> 01:52.500
PUTTING THE HUNTER FAMILY
ON TAPE.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.567
IT'D BE GREAT.

01:53.567 --> 01:57.500
IT'D BE LIKE COURT TV
WITHOUT THE COURT.

02:00.667 --> 02:03.500
SHAWN, I GOT A LIGHT,
CAMERA, VIDEO--

02:03.500 --> 02:05.734
EVERYTHING WE NEED
TO FILM YOUR FAMILY.

02:05.734 --> 02:08.500
GREAT. REMEMBER,
WHEN YOU'RE ON
MY AUNT LORENA,

02:08.500 --> 02:09.867
KEEP YOUR HANDS
VISIBLE,

02:09.867 --> 02:13.500
AND DON'T REACH
FOR ANYTHING QUICKLY
IN YOUR POCKET.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.000
HEY, MATTHEWS.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.467
HEY, WILLIAMS...

02:17.467 --> 02:18.500
COMMA MISTER.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.667
GLAD TO SEE YOU SIGNED OUT
VIDEO EQUIPMENT.

02:21.667 --> 02:24.300
YOU ENTERING CHANNEL 5'S
NEWS CONTEST?

02:24.300 --> 02:27.600
ACTUALLY, CORY'S
JUST SHOOTING
A VIDEO FOR ME.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.867
WHAT CONTEST IS THIS?

02:28.867 --> 02:31.233
IT'S OPEN
TO HIGH SCHOOL KIDS
ALL ACROSS PHILLY.

02:31.233 --> 02:32.300
THEY'RE RUNNING
THE BEST STORY
ON THE AIR.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.967
I THINK YOU
GOT A SHOT.

02:33.967 --> 02:37.033
WHY, MR. WILLIAMS,
YOU FLATTER ME.

02:37.033 --> 02:38.700
YOU'RE GOOD
WITH THAT CAMERA,

02:38.700 --> 02:40.200
BUT IT'S DUE
IN TWO DAYS.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.500
CORY, WHAT ABOUT
THE TRAILER PARK?

02:44.567 --> 02:46.000
UH, THANKS,
MR. WILLIAMS,

02:46.000 --> 02:47.400
BUT I ALREADY
PROMISED SHAWN.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.967
O.K. BUT IF YOU'RE INSPIRED
AND WIN A CONTEST LIKE THIS,

02:50.967 --> 02:52.100
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY.

02:52.100 --> 02:55.467
WELL, I HEAR YOU.
HEY, SLAP ME SOME.

02:55.467 --> 02:58.033
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN'.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.200
COME ALONG,
MR. MATTHEWS.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.500
DON'T DAWDLE.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.667
I'M NOT DAWDLING.
I'M JUST NOT
WEARING UNDERWEAR.

03:07.734 --> 03:10.500
A LITTLE MORE
THAN I NEEDED TO KNOW.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.467
WHAT WILL YOU DO
WITH THIS JUNKY OLD LAMP?

03:13.467 --> 03:17.600
THAT JUNKY OLD LAMP
IS WORTH OVER $800.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.000
WITHOUT A LIGHT BULB?
PSHAW!

03:21.100 --> 03:23.000
COME ON, MR. FEENY,
BOTTOM LINE ME.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.700
I WAS CLEANING OUT
MY ATTIC,

03:24.700 --> 03:30.600
AND I FOUND A TRUNK
THAT BELONGED TO MY
GREAT AUNT FANNY.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.600
FANNY FEENY?

03:36.100 --> 03:38.200
DON'T GO THERE.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.200
ANYWAY,
OUT OF CURIOSITY,

03:41.200 --> 03:44.033
I TOOK IT TO
LANKERSHIM AND SLOAN'S.

03:44.033 --> 03:45.800
AH, THE ROOFERS.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.567
NO. THE APPRAISAL HOUSE.

03:49.567 --> 03:52.800
THEY INVITE THE PUBLIC
TO BRING IN THEIR
SO-CALLED JUNK.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.934
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE
YOU FIND A TREASURE.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.600
EVERYDAY JUNK
WORTH SOMETHING?

03:56.600 --> 03:58.200
WAIT, MR. FEENY!

03:58.200 --> 04:00.200
YOU GOT A GREAT IDEA.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.367
YOUR JUNK, MY JUNK,

04:01.367 --> 04:03.600
WE'LL START A BUSINESS
TOGETHER--

04:03.600 --> 04:05.567
ERIC AND SONS.

04:06.600 --> 04:10.133
I CAN SEE WHY YOU GET
FIRST BILLING.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.734
LET'S START
WITH MY UNCLE MIKE.

04:18.734 --> 04:19.867
YOU'LL LOVE HIM.

04:19.867 --> 04:22.767
OF ALL MY RELATIVES,
HE'S THE FRIENDLIEST.

04:23.867 --> 04:25.033
GET LOST, SCUM!

04:25.033 --> 04:29.000
SHAWN,
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
BOTHER YOUR UNCLE.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.834
I THINK
THAT'S MY AUNT.

04:30.834 --> 04:32.300
UNCLE MIKE,
OPEN UP!

04:32.300 --> 04:34.033
THERE IS
NO UNCLE MIKE!

04:34.033 --> 04:38.100
I'M AN OLD SHUT-IN
LIVING ON MY PENSION.

04:38.100 --> 04:39.600
GO AWAY!

04:39.600 --> 04:41.800
IT'S ME,
YOUR NEPHEW SHAWN.

04:41.800 --> 04:42.834
SHAWN?

04:42.834 --> 04:44.667
SHAWNY!
HA HA HA!

04:44.667 --> 04:46.233
HEY, WHAT'S WITH
THE CAMERA?

04:46.233 --> 04:47.600
SHAWN, YOU SET ME UP.

04:47.600 --> 04:52.667
NO, NO. YOU REMEMBER
THAT VIDEO LETTER
I TOLD YOU ABOUT?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.233
WELL, THIS IS CORY.

04:54.233 --> 04:55.367
HOW YOU DOING?

04:55.367 --> 04:57.000
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.767
NOTHING.

04:58.767 --> 05:01.100
THEN I'M DOING GREAT.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.300
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU DOING THIS.

05:03.300 --> 05:06.500
I KNOW HOW MUCH FAMILY
MEANS TO YOU, SHAWNY.

05:06.500 --> 05:09.800
BESIDES, EVERYBODY HERE
AT THE PINK FLAMINGO
TRAILER PARK

05:09.800 --> 05:12.967
IS REAL EXCITED
ABOUT BEING PART OF IT.

05:12.967 --> 05:15.500
WELL, EXCEPT
FOR GRANDPA LEWIS.

05:15.500 --> 05:18.734
LAST WEEK,
HE GOT PICKED UP.

05:18.734 --> 05:19.967
POLICE?

05:19.967 --> 05:21.367
TORNADO.

05:21.367 --> 05:25.100
WELL, UNCLE MIKE,
WHY DON'T YOU CALL
EVERYONE TOGETHER,

05:25.100 --> 05:26.900
AND WE CAN GET STARTED?

05:26.900 --> 05:27.900
O.K.

05:27.900 --> 05:29.867
ALL HUNTERS OUT NOW!

05:29.867 --> 05:32.100
WE DIDN'T DO IT!
WE DIDN'T DO IT!

05:32.100 --> 05:34.300
THAT'S OUR FAMILY MOTTO.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.934
AND...GO.

05:36.934 --> 05:38.100
HI, DAD, IT'S ME,

05:38.100 --> 05:40.700
STANDING WITH
GRANDMA HUNTER
AND HER ATTORNEY.

05:40.700 --> 05:43.767
SINCE GRANDMA'S
UNDER A GAG ORDER
AND MEDICATION,

05:43.767 --> 05:47.200
HER ATTORNEY PREPARED
THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.600
"TO MY ALLEGED SON CHET,

05:49.600 --> 05:50.800
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.000
"THESE LOVING WORDS ARE
NOT AN ADMISSION OF GUILT

05:53.000 --> 05:57.600
IN THE TRIAL OF <i>THE PEOPLE </i>
<i>VS. GERTIE HUNTER." </i>

05:57.600 --> 06:01.967
ANY WOMAN THAT CAN
GIVE BIRTH TO ME
IS ONE TOUGH BROAD.

06:01.967 --> 06:05.000
HEY, CORY, THANKS AGAIN
FOR DOING THIS.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.400
I'VE NEVER SEEN MY FAMILY
OPEN UP LIKE THIS.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.133
SHAWN, NOBODY
SAID ANYTHING.

06:10.133 --> 06:15.100
MAYBE THE PROBLEM LIES
WITHIN YOU, OUTSIDER.

06:16.133 --> 06:19.500
IT'S FOOD
FOR THOUGHT, SIR.

06:20.667 --> 06:23.500
I COULD TAKE YOU.

06:24.834 --> 06:26.100
SHAWN...

06:27.133 --> 06:28.400
YOUR UNCLE'S INSANE!

06:28.400 --> 06:32.100
IT WAS AN OPTION,
BUT HE NEVER PLEADED
THAT WAY.

06:32.100 --> 06:36.133
THE TAPE WOULD BE BETTER
IF THE FAMILY TALKS MORE.

06:36.133 --> 06:38.033
YOU WANT A HUNTER
TO TALK?

06:38.033 --> 06:43.400
PUT 'EM IN A SITUATION
WHERE THEY'RE NOT
AFRAID TO TALK.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.400
ACTION!

06:44.400 --> 06:46.667
[DISGUISED VOICES]
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHET,

06:46.667 --> 06:48.367
FROM ALL THE HUNTERS

06:48.367 --> 06:52.467
HERE AT THIS
UNDISCLOSED LOCATION.

06:52.467 --> 06:56.400
O.K. I'M GOING TO
TURN THE CAMERA OFF,
ALL RIGHT?

06:56.400 --> 06:59.734
I'M NOT GOING
FOR MY POCKETS.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.734
YOU KNOW, DAD WILL
GET A KICK OUT OF THIS.

07:04.734 --> 07:07.133
IT WAS NICE TO HAVE
THE FAMILY TOGETHER.

07:07.133 --> 07:09.100
I'LL SEND YOU A COPY.

07:09.100 --> 07:13.700
WHY WOULD YOU
MAKE COPIES?

07:14.767 --> 07:16.867
YOU'RE A TALL,
TALL MAN.

07:16.867 --> 07:17.967
THANKS.

07:17.967 --> 07:21.734
YOU KNOW, SHAWNY,
YOU GOT A GOOD FRIEND HERE.

07:21.734 --> 07:22.934
UNCLE MIKE.

07:22.934 --> 07:26.300
HEY, IT FELL OUT.

07:31.934 --> 07:34.567
ANYBODY ELSE
WE GOT TO TALK TO?

07:34.567 --> 07:36.300
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
EVERYBODY.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.400
LOOK WHO'S SLUMMING.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.300
IT'S SHAWN.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.567
EDDIE.

07:41.567 --> 07:46.100
I GUESS THIS IS WHERE YOU
RETURN TO THE TRAILER PARK.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.800
YOU KNOW WE MISSED YOU.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.900
NO. I'M REAL HAPPY
LIVING WHERE I AM.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.200
OH, YEAH.
OUT IN THE SUBURBS...

07:53.200 --> 07:56.767
WITH THEIR FANCY HOMES
BUILT INTO THE GROUND.

07:56.767 --> 07:57.967
HEY, BUILT-IN.

07:57.967 --> 07:59.400
ME?

07:59.400 --> 08:00.834
YOU GOT A NAME?

08:00.834 --> 08:02.133
UH, IT'S CORY.

08:02.133 --> 08:08.900
BUT, UH...MY KARATE STUDENTS
REFER TO ME AS DR. PAIN.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.000
I COULD TAKE YOU.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
WHAT ARE YOU, 12?

08:15.000 --> 08:18.300
11. AND I CAN
MAKE YOU BARK.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.500
HA HA HA!

08:19.500 --> 08:22.400
THIS IS A NICE CAMERA.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
IT'S MINE.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.667
WHAT'S IT DOING HERE?

08:25.667 --> 08:29.500
JUST FILMING SOME VIDEO
WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.200
YOU DIDN'T ASK ME
TO BE IN IT?

08:32.200 --> 08:33.500
SHOULD I BE INSULTED?

08:33.500 --> 08:35.000
I GOT PLENTY OF TAPE.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.033
CORY, NO.

08:36.033 --> 08:38.700
HEY, EDDIE, I'M NOT
BOTHERING ANYBODY,

08:38.700 --> 08:41.500
SO WHY DON'T YOU
GET LOST?

08:41.500 --> 08:42.500
NO.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.800
NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:43.800 --> 08:45.900
WE STILL LIVE HERE.
YOU DON'T.

08:45.900 --> 08:50.600
SO YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
CORKY-DORKY SHOULD GET LOST.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.000
HEY!
HEY WHAT?

08:52.000 --> 08:56.467
HEY...WHAT'S THE FASTEST WAY
OUT OF HERE?

09:05.834 --> 09:07.300
ERIC, YOU'RE FILTHY.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.133
YEAH. FILTHY RICH.

09:09.133 --> 09:13.400
WHY DO YOU HAVE
A BOX FULL OF JUNK?

09:16.100 --> 09:17.100
JUNK!

09:17.100 --> 09:20.567
YOU CALL THESE
GAMBLING DOGS JUNK?

09:20.567 --> 09:23.667
ALAN, TAKE THE SHARP THINGS
OUT OF THAT BOX.

09:23.667 --> 09:26.734
OBVIOUSLY, YOU GUYS AREN'T
GOING TO FIGURE THIS OUT
BY YOURSELVES.

09:26.734 --> 09:27.934
OBVIOUSLY.

09:27.934 --> 09:31.000
MR. FEENY HAD
GOOBLES OF JUNK
AROUND HIS HOUSE.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.667
SOME OF IT COULD BE
WORTH A TON OF MONEY.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.400
I SAID TO MYSELF,
"KYLE--"

09:35.400 --> 09:36.467
KYLE?

09:36.467 --> 09:38.100
THAT'S WHAT I
CALL MYSELF.

09:38.100 --> 09:40.200
"KYLE,
YOU SHOULD GET
UNDER THIS BANDWAGON

09:40.200 --> 09:43.100
AND MAKE SOME MONEY
BY CLEANING OUT
YOUR ROOM."

09:43.100 --> 09:46.500
MR. FEENY'S COLLECTIBLES
ARE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

09:46.500 --> 09:52.600
WHOA! I THINK ERIC MIGHT BE
ON TO SOMETHING HERE, HMM?

09:52.600 --> 09:54.233
THE GARAGE AND THE ATTIC,

09:54.233 --> 09:57.000
IT MIGHT BE FULL OF
UNDISCOVERED TREASURES.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.100
CLEAN THEM OUT,
SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.233
CLEAN THE GARAGE
AND ATTIC?

10:02.233 --> 10:04.100
YOU GUYS
WOULD LET ME?

10:04.100 --> 10:07.000
WHATEVER MAKES
YOU AND KYLE HAPPY.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.467
YES!

10:08.467 --> 10:12.734
UH, MOM, DAD,
WE'RE GOING TO SHAWN'S
TO WATCH A TAPE.

10:12.734 --> 10:14.967
HOLD UP A SECOND,
HUNTER.

10:14.967 --> 10:16.400
WHAT'S IN THAT BOX?

10:16.400 --> 10:18.467
SOME JUNK
FROM THE TRAILER PARK.

10:18.467 --> 10:22.667
GIVE YOU 30 BUCKS
FOR THAT PINK FLAMINGO.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.467
SURE.

10:24.467 --> 10:26.567
HERE YOU GO.

10:26.567 --> 10:28.200

10:37.600 --> 10:40.600
THAT GUY EDDIE
WALKED THROUGH THE SHOT.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.867
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,

10:41.867 --> 10:46.367
SEEING AS HOW THAT
SCARY 11-YEAR-OLD
WAS WITH HIM.

10:46.367 --> 10:47.500
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.567
HEY, LOOK.
AND HE'S CARRYING
A COMPUTER.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.000
THE GUY'S A CLOSET NERD.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.934
OR MAYBE IT'S NOT HIS.

10:54.934 --> 10:58.133
IF IT'S NOT HIS,
THAT WOULD MEAN...

10:58.133 --> 10:59.667
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S STOLEN.

10:59.667 --> 11:03.200
AND I HAVE IT ON TAPE.
THIS IS GREAT!

11:03.200 --> 11:04.200
WHY?

11:04.200 --> 11:06.033
THAT NEWS CONTEST
ON CHANNEL 5.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.200
HOW COULD THIS
NOT WIN?

11:07.200 --> 11:11.133
WAIT, CORY.
WE WENT THERE
TO FILM MY FAMILY,

11:11.133 --> 11:12.233
NOT TO WIN
SOME AWARD.

11:12.233 --> 11:15.600
YOU GOT YOUR VIDEO,
AND I GOT MY HOT STORY.

11:15.600 --> 11:19.200
DO ME A FAVOR--
FORGET ABOUT THE TAPE.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.900
COME ON.
GIVE ME A REASON.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.700
NO. JUST DROP IT
AND GO HOME.

11:24.700 --> 11:27.200
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WITHOUT MY TAPE.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.100
YOU WANT IT?
YEAH.

11:29.100 --> 11:30.100
FINE.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.233
HERE.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.500
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO DO THAT.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.700
IT'S MY FAMILY.

11:35.700 --> 11:40.000
THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I DO YOU A FAVOR.

[DOOR SLAMS]

11:48.567 --> 11:51.200
HEY, MY DAD CALLED
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.500
HE GOT TO USE
THE OVAL TOILET.

11:53.500 --> 11:58.233
THE ONLY THING
I WANT TO HEAR
IS AN EXPLANATION.

11:58.233 --> 11:59.967
ABOUT THE TAPE?

11:59.967 --> 12:01.667
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

12:01.667 --> 12:02.867
THAT'S NOT
AN EXPLANATION.

12:02.867 --> 12:06.300
WHY DID YOU
RIP OUT MY TAPE?

12:06.300 --> 12:07.600
IT JUST HAPPENED, O.K.?

12:07.600 --> 12:11.400
SHAWN, I CAUGHT
THOSE GUYS ON TAPE
STEALING COMPUTERS.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.834
I COULD'VE WON AN AWARD
OR SOMETHING.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.100
MAYBE I WAS
DOING YOU A FAVOR.

12:17.100 --> 12:21.000
NO. IT BOTHERS YOU
THAT I FOUND SOMETHING
I'M GOOD AT.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.934
SHUT UP
AND LET GO OF ME.

12:22.934 --> 12:25.500
WHY ARE YOU ACTING
LIKE I DID SOMETHING?

12:25.500 --> 12:27.033
LET GO OF ME.

12:27.033 --> 12:28.100
FINE.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.200
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT,

12:30.200 --> 12:32.600
NO. YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.133
I DO.

12:35.233 --> 12:37.200
FIGHT!
FIGHT!

12:39.200 --> 12:40.500
BREAK IT UP!

12:40.500 --> 12:43.200
GET BACK TO CLASS NOW!

12:45.100 --> 12:46.834
HUNTER? MATTHEWS?

12:46.834 --> 12:49.500
YOU GUYS KNOW YOU WERE
FIGHTING EACH OTHER?

12:49.500 --> 12:50.500
I'M OUT OF HERE.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.500
NO, SHAWN, NOT UNTIL
SOMEBODY TELLS ME

12:53.500 --> 12:55.300
WHY YOU WERE
GOING AT IT.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.567

WITH A CAMERA,

WHEN YOU CAN DO THIS.

13:01.867 --> 13:03.867
HEY, HEY, WATCH IT.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.600
I CAN'T DO THAT,
EITHER.

LOOK, MR. WILLIAMS,
I'VE BEEN INSPIRED.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.567

IN THAT NEWS CONTEST.

13:12.567 --> 13:17.367
I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL HAVE THE TIME,
MR. MATTHEWS.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.400
DETENTION?

13:19.400 --> 13:21.100
LET'S NOT CALL IT
DETENTION.

13:21.100 --> 13:24.900
I PREFER
"HOOKED ON FEENY."

13:26.400 --> 13:27.700
[BELL RINGS]

13:27.700 --> 13:30.800

EXCELLENT DETENTION,

ALTHOUGH
I WASN'T THRILLED
WITH MY CODETAINEE,

DO THIS AGAIN SOMETIME.

ARE CONFIRMED FOR TOMORROW.

TO THE TRAILER PARK?

13:49.900 --> 13:51.000
NOT THAT I CARE.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.300
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHERE I'M GOING.

13:55.867 --> 13:57.000
LISTEN, CORY,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.367
THIS HITTING THING,
IT'S NOT NICE.

14:18.133 --> 14:20.667
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST
REALLY FRUSTRATED.

14:20.667 --> 14:24.500

DO THAT FOR?

14:32.100 --> 14:33.867
WELL, I'M FRUSTRATED, TOO.

14:33.867 --> 14:34.867
WHY?

14:34.867 --> 14:37.600
I'M FRUSTRATED TO SEE
TWO YOUNG MEN

14:37.600 --> 14:39.467
THROW AWAY A FRIENDSHIP.

14:39.467 --> 14:43.000
THE WAY I SEE IT,
YOU DON'T NEED FRIENDS,

14:43.000 --> 14:44.567
ESPECIALLY
FRIENDS LIKE HIM.

14:44.567 --> 14:48.233
THEN WHO DO YOU COUNT ON,
MR. HUNTER?

14:48.233 --> 14:50.700
FAMILY.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.300
YOUR FAMILY IS
ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU.

14:53.300 --> 14:55.367

WITH NO FRIENDS,

KNOW I'M RIGHT.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.400

A LOT OF FAMILY.

WELL, ACTUALLY, I HAVE
VERY LITTLE FAMILY
IN PHILADELPHIA.

15:05.300 --> 15:09.700
YEAH? WHAT DO YOU DO ON
HOLIDAYS AND BIRTHDAYS?

15:09.700 --> 15:14.000
I GET TOGETHER
WITH A SMALL CIRCLE
OF CLOSE FRIENDS.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.467
IT'S REALLY QUITE NICE.

15:15.467 --> 15:16.834
WE LAUGH. WE REMINISCE.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.934
WE TAKE PRIDE
IN EACH OTHER,

PRETTY MUCH WHAT
YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE
WITH THE MATTHEWS.

15:21.734 --> 15:26.967
YEAH, BUT IT CAN'T BE
THE SAME AS BEING
WITH REAL FAMILY.

OH, MR. HUNTER,

15:28.867 --> 15:33.734

AND THE GARAGE.

ROB ANYONE.

HAD 70 IN MY WALLET,

10 BUCKS.

HAUL THIS JUNK
TO THE TRASH.

I GOT TO GET CLOSER.
I GOT TO GET CLOSER.

16:55.467 --> 16:56.667
TOO CLOSE.

IS GOING ON HERE?

NAMES AND ADDRESSES.

17:31.734 --> 17:33.233

17:33.233 --> 17:37.000
AND I LIVE
AT THE CORNER OF

THINKING OUT LOUD.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.400
HERE'S MY PROBLEM.

17:56.400 --> 18:00.567
I CAN'T LET YOU LEAVE
BECAUSE I CAN'T TRUST YOU.

18:00.567 --> 18:02.200
SO WHAT DO I DO?

18:02.200 --> 18:04.200
MAYBE I KEEP POUNDING
YOUR FACE

18:04.200 --> 18:07.400
UNTIL YOU FORGET
EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENED TONIGHT.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.400
SHAWN!

18:08.400 --> 18:09.767
BACK OFF, EDDIE.

NO BUSINESS HERE.

I DO.

YOU TOUCH HIM AGAIN,

TO DEAL WITH.

SWING AT ME?

18:18.467 --> 18:19.500
NO.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.700
THEN WHAT?

18:20.700 --> 18:24.767
I'LL CALL THE COPS,
LET THEM FIGURE IT
OUT.

TALKING ABOUT?

COME ON, MAN.
I'M YOUR BROTHER.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.100
I'LL DO IT
IF I HAVE TO.

18:43.100 --> 18:46.834

BETTER THAN ME.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.233

HAVE YOU BEEN
HIDING?

19:17.900 --> 19:20.200
A WIFE?
YOU GOT KIDS?

19:21.500 --> 19:25.500
SORRY, COR.
JUST DIDN'T SEEM
WORTH TALKING ABOUT.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.400
SO THAT'S WHY
YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
TO HAND IN MY STORY.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.934

WAS RIGHT.

GOOD REPORTER.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.300
TAKE IT.
IT'S YOUR FAMILY.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.500
NO, NO. YOU TAKE IT.
GO WIN THAT CONTEST.

19:54.500 --> 19:58.867
WHAT ABOUT PROTECTING
YOUR FAMILY?

20:00.200 --> 20:02.133

ABOUT THE WORK YOU DID,

20:21.467 --> 20:24.500
YOUR MOTHER,
BEING THE SENSITIVE,

20:24.500 --> 20:27.100
GUILTY SOUL
THAT SHE IS--

20:27.100 --> 20:28.600
OH, ALAN, YOU STOP IT!

20:28.600 --> 20:31.300
WE'RE GOING TO PAY YOU
FOR YOUR WORK. 60 BUCKS.

20:31.300 --> 20:32.367
OH!

20:32.367 --> 20:34.133

ANY CHANGE?

20:34.133 --> 20:35.367
I NEED SOME 20s.

20:35.367 --> 20:39.200
WAIT. HANG ON.
LET ME SEE IF
I CAN HELP YOU OUT.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.867

ONLY GOT 100s.

20:44.467 --> 20:47.467
FROM THAT SCAM HOUSE,
LANKERSHIM AND SLOAN'S.

20:47.467 --> 20:50.767
ONE OF THOSE BOXES
HAD AN OLD WOODEN MASK.

20:50.767 --> 20:52.000
THEY WERE SO IMPRESSED
THEY GAVE ME A FEW REASONS

20:52.000 --> 20:53.600
