WEBVTT

02:25.235 --> 02:26.987
(Beverly) Sure I have.

02:27.076 --> 02:31.546
- Well, I've discovered why sex is.
- You have? Fantastic!

02:31.636 --> 02:34.434
It's because humans
don't live underwater.

02:35.476 --> 02:37.034
I don't get it.

02:37.115 --> 02:42.634
Fish don't need sex, because they just lay
the eggs and fertilise them in the water.

02:42.715 --> 02:45.947
Humans can't do that
because they don't live in water.

02:46.036 --> 02:49.995
They have to... internalise the water.
Therefore we have sex.

02:50.076 --> 02:54.035
So you mean humans wouldn't have sex
if they lived in the water?

02:54.117 --> 02:59.474
They'd have a kind of sex. The kind where
you wouldn't have to touch each other.

02:59.556 --> 03:01.114
I like that idea.

03:01.196 --> 03:04.348
Have you heard of scuba diving?
It's just new.

03:04.437 --> 03:07.668
Self-contained underwater
breathing apparatus.

03:07.757 --> 03:09.315
Exactly.

03:11.957 --> 03:16.235
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah. You ask her.

03:22.037 --> 03:26.474
Raffaella, will you have sex with us
in our bathtub? It's an experiment.

03:26.557 --> 03:30.267
Are you kidding?
Fuck off, you freaks!

03:30.358 --> 03:32.666
I'm telling my father you talk dirty.

03:32.757 --> 03:36.909
Besides, I know for a fact
you don't even know what "fuck" is!

03:44.638 --> 03:46.629
They're so different from us,...

03:46.719 --> 03:49.709
..and all because
we don't live underwater.

03:54.438 --> 03:56.871
The morculum is working superbly.

03:56.959 --> 04:00.393
- Shall I insert the manticulator?
- Please.

04:04.719 --> 04:06.675
What's the diagnosis?

04:07.479 --> 04:09.435
Intra-ovular surgery.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.680
Where did you get that instrument?

04:48.319 --> 04:50.880
- We had it made for us.
- Really?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.993
Might be fine for a cadaver.
It won't work with a living patient.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.833
(drops instrument)

05:17.841 --> 05:19.796
To our fabulous twins,...

05:19.881 --> 05:22.714
..who have, as mere undergraduates,...

05:22.801 --> 05:25.315
..already brought us glory.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.675
(all) Hear, hear!

05:27.762 --> 05:29.717
And here it is,...

05:31.082 --> 05:32.640
..in solid gold...

05:32.722 --> 05:35.872
Er, well, solid gold plate, that is!

05:35.962 --> 05:37.519
(laughter)

05:37.602 --> 05:41.675
The Mantle retractor, which is now
the standard of the industry.

05:41.761 --> 05:44.719
Here's to a brilliant future!

05:46.042 --> 05:47.997
(cheering)

05:58.722 --> 06:00.280
Here it is.

06:02.642 --> 06:04.201
That's wonderful!

06:04.282 --> 06:05.431
Yeah.

06:16.763 --> 06:18.833
They got the pivot pin in backwards.

06:18.923 --> 06:21.482
Bev, you should've been there.

06:22.604 --> 06:24.161
I was.

06:40.123 --> 06:43.639
Well?
Are all the necessary parts there, Doc?

06:43.963 --> 06:45.522
Yes, they are.

06:46.764 --> 06:50.153
And there are a couple of extra ones
that shouldn't be.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.802
Not funny.

06:54.683 --> 06:56.959
Er, no... I wasn't joking.

07:03.404 --> 07:07.158
Would you excuse me a minute?
I'll be right back.

07:18.124 --> 07:22.084
Elly, I want you to look at
this woman before you go.

07:22.925 --> 07:27.396
I'm late, Bev. If I fuck up with the
chairman's wife, we lose our grant.

07:27.485 --> 07:31.274
She's a trifurcate.
I've never seen anything like it.

07:31.366 --> 07:35.325
Down in a minute. It's Dr Mantle.
Keep the car waiting. Thanks.

07:36.365 --> 07:38.321
Is this Claire Niveau?

07:38.405 --> 07:39.555
Yeah.

07:41.966 --> 07:44.764
- What, the Claire Niveau?
- Yeah.

07:44.846 --> 07:46.801
Ooh! What's she doing here?

07:46.887 --> 07:51.881
A mini-series. She's got three agents
and a bodyguard in the waiting room.

07:51.966 --> 07:55.641
- And her life is empty without children.
- How did you know?

07:55.726 --> 07:59.765
Bev, everyone knows that! Don't you
ever read the National Enquirer?

07:59.846 --> 08:02.759
"Star's life empty without children."

08:02.846 --> 08:08.046
I hope it also explained how we can make
her fertile, because I don't think I can.

08:08.127 --> 08:10.562
Then we'll have to see what I can do.

08:10.647 --> 08:14.526
Elly, what about dinner
with the chairman's wife?

08:16.727 --> 08:20.082
I guess la bella contessa
will have to wait.

08:31.088 --> 08:33.602
Right, let's take another look.

08:37.807 --> 08:39.365
Yes...

08:41.568 --> 08:43.320
That's fantastic.

08:43.407 --> 08:47.606
I've never had anybody say that
about the inside of my body before.

08:47.689 --> 08:50.838
Surely you've heard of inner beauty?

08:55.247 --> 08:59.527
I've often thought there should be
beauty contests for the insides of bodies.

08:59.608 --> 09:01.280
You know, best spleen...

09:01.368 --> 09:06.648
Most perfectly developed kidneys...
Why don't we have standards of beauty...

09:06.728 --> 09:09.800
..for the entire human body,...

09:09.889 --> 09:11.844
..inside and out?

09:11.929 --> 09:14.523
I have a feeling you do.

09:14.608 --> 09:17.600
So I'll tell 'em to fuck off.
Pardon my French.

09:17.689 --> 09:22.558
Don't tell them to fuck off. I need the work.
This mini-series is paying peanuts.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.118
You don't need to be humiliated.

09:25.209 --> 09:26.961
I've decided.

09:27.048 --> 09:29.085
I want to be humiliated.

09:33.210 --> 09:35.678
Tell me about my uterus.

09:35.769 --> 09:37.202
(coughs)

09:39.329 --> 09:41.286
Well, it has three doorways.

09:41.369 --> 09:45.158
Three cervixes leading into
three separate compartments...

09:45.250 --> 09:47.969
..in your uterus.
That is fabulously rare.

09:49.490 --> 09:52.085
Do you have trouble with your periods?

09:52.171 --> 09:56.528
Listen... um... I'm gonna be late
for the Axelrod meeting. You'll be OK?

09:56.610 --> 10:01.968
Goodbye, Leo. Remember, I need
the humiliation as well as the money.

10:08.370 --> 10:10.725
I almost never have periods.

10:11.531 --> 10:13.486
Once or twice a year.

10:13.570 --> 10:15.925
Not very enthusiastic ones.

10:16.810 --> 10:21.248
Could I have triplets, do you think?
One in each compartment?

10:21.330 --> 10:24.084
No. It doesn't work like that.

10:24.171 --> 10:26.001
Really?

10:26.091 --> 10:28.685
How does it work?

10:29.852 --> 10:32.809
How did it go with la bella contessa?

10:34.731 --> 10:36.687
Did we get our grant?

10:36.771 --> 10:38.921
You were great.

10:39.011 --> 10:41.765
Seductive and charming as usual.

10:43.972 --> 10:46.123
And I think you've got your grant.

10:46.212 --> 10:47.565
Hey,...

10:47.651 --> 10:49.404
..wait a minute.

10:49.491 --> 10:52.529
What's this I hear?
It's for us, not just for me.

10:52.613 --> 10:55.172
- It's for Mantle lnc.
- Yes, yes.

10:57.172 --> 10:59.732
- I know.
- Did she catch on?

11:07.092 --> 11:10.050
Ah, Contessa, you're looking so...

11:10.132 --> 11:13.489
..l don't know,
so Catherine Deneuve tonight!

11:15.812 --> 11:17.769
And how is Marcello?

11:18.852 --> 11:23.323
Due cappuccini, per favore, and quickly.
The Countess...

11:23.413 --> 11:27.372
..is a tigress until she's got
her caffeine in the morning!

11:30.573 --> 11:31.721
Hey,...

11:31.814 --> 11:33.610
..come on,...

11:33.693 --> 11:35.252
..l'm not that bad.

11:35.333 --> 11:38.292
You're a little bit smoother in real life.

11:38.373 --> 11:40.409
And the movie star,...

11:40.494 --> 11:42.450
..how is she?

11:42.534 --> 11:46.082
She's expecting me for lunch tomorrow.

11:47.453 --> 11:50.411
So you're going to find out for yourself.

11:50.494 --> 11:52.849
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes.

11:53.894 --> 11:55.645
It's all set up.

11:55.734 --> 11:59.488
The production's rented her
this little apartment...

11:59.574 --> 12:01.485
..in Rosedale!

12:01.574 --> 12:03.929
She'll just be getting out of bed,...

12:04.013 --> 12:06.370
..all cosy and warm.

12:08.855 --> 12:11.846
Look, Elly...
the clinic's booked to the hilt.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.925
We've got to pay the rent, you know.

12:15.014 --> 12:17.768
- I'll take your patients.
- Oh, yes(!)

12:19.055 --> 12:20.806
I want you to go.

12:22.335 --> 12:24.643
Bev, you've got to try the movie star.

12:25.375 --> 12:27.570
She's unbelievable.

12:30.656 --> 12:33.614
Don't worry, you'll be all right.

12:33.695 --> 12:35.731
Just do me.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.892
(doorbell buzzes)

12:54.376 --> 12:56.332
(door buzzes open)

13:10.296 --> 13:12.856
What did you do to me last night?

13:15.697 --> 13:17.654
(distant footsteps)

13:19.177 --> 13:21.611
I'm still vibrating all over.

13:21.697 --> 13:24.006
I learnt it from books.

13:24.097 --> 13:27.772
Mmm, I wish more men
would read those books!

13:36.379 --> 13:37.936
Drink?

13:38.018 --> 13:39.973
No... thanks.

14:03.659 --> 14:05.411
Well, Doc,...

14:07.579 --> 14:09.534
..what's the prognosis?

14:10.418 --> 14:13.775
Can I have a baby... or can't l?

14:13.859 --> 14:17.089
You're asking me that now?
l-l mean, here?

14:17.179 --> 14:20.376
You said the results would be back today.

14:33.059 --> 14:36.688
There's no chance that you'll
be able to bear children.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.375
I'm not surprised.

14:48.460 --> 14:50.815
You must've been tested before.

14:50.900 --> 14:55.849
Oh, they said... I wouldn't have
an easy time getting pregnant.

14:57.260 --> 14:59.216
But I've been taking...

14:59.300 --> 15:01.255
..hormone injections.

15:04.260 --> 15:07.412
And I have been extremely promiscuous.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.698
I've never...

15:09.781 --> 15:12.420
..used... um... contraceptive devices.

15:12.501 --> 15:16.050
I've never even thought
contraceptive thoughts.

15:18.262 --> 15:22.618
There are other reasons for
not sleeping with just... anybody.

15:23.981 --> 15:27.257
That's true, you know.
I never thought of that.

15:29.142 --> 15:31.097
Oh, of course, you...

15:32.022 --> 15:33.976
..had a chance to...

15:34.061 --> 15:35.892
..check me out...

15:35.981 --> 15:37.937
..thoroughly...

15:38.021 --> 15:40.377
..before you jumped on me.

15:40.462 --> 15:44.214
Are you that careful?
Do you only have affairs with patients?

15:44.301 --> 15:46.896
No, I was... concerned...

15:46.981 --> 15:49.337
Am I bad? ls that it?

15:50.902 --> 15:53.051
You gonna spank me, Doc?

15:53.902 --> 15:55.938
It hadn't occurred to me.

15:57.742 --> 15:59.654
I've been bad...

15:59.743 --> 16:02.051
..and I need to be punished.

16:09.822 --> 16:11.778
I need to be punished.

16:12.902 --> 16:14.813
(sobbing)

16:22.342 --> 16:23.695
Danuta.

16:25.302 --> 16:26.657
Danuta.

16:26.744 --> 16:28.494
(shouts) Danuta!

16:32.144 --> 16:37.093
As soon as we get some cold water
on your face, you'll feel much better.

16:44.143 --> 16:45.098
Elly...

16:45.183 --> 16:48.335
- What happened?
- Thank God you're back, Bev!

16:49.383 --> 16:51.773
I'm just no good with the serious ones.

16:51.864 --> 16:53.855
Why are you back?

16:55.144 --> 16:58.658
I'm just no good with the frivolous ones.

16:58.744 --> 17:02.817
(Elliot laughs) All she wanted was
a little slap on the arse, Bev.

17:02.904 --> 17:04.337
Yeah?

17:05.343 --> 17:09.736
Yeah, well, I wondered what the fuck
my brother had got us into...

17:09.825 --> 17:11.576
..behind my back.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.622
She's an actress, Bev, she's a flake.

17:14.705 --> 17:19.255
She plays games all the time.
You never know who she really is.

17:21.065 --> 17:22.498
Yeah.

17:23.464 --> 17:25.217
I can see that.

17:26.025 --> 17:27.777
You can?

17:27.865 --> 17:29.218
Yeah!

17:29.305 --> 17:35.096
So... when are you gonna see her again?
She's called the clinic five times already.

17:35.186 --> 17:38.144
I don't know. Perhaps you'd better go.

17:39.346 --> 17:41.301
Wait a minute,...

17:42.465 --> 17:44.421
..this is serious.

17:44.505 --> 17:46.461
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

17:46.545 --> 17:49.618
If we didn't share women,
you'd still be a virgin.

17:49.706 --> 17:51.981
- No.
- You'd never get laid on your own.

17:52.066 --> 17:53.465
I don't get out much.

17:55.907 --> 18:00.297
Listen, the beauty of our business
is you don't have to get out...

18:00.386 --> 18:04.173
- ..to meet beautiful women.
- No, I can't do that. It's not...

18:04.267 --> 18:06.700
- Ethical.
- No.

18:07.426 --> 18:09.382
It's not... safe.

18:10.907 --> 18:13.137
Well, if you don't go and see her...

18:14.546 --> 18:17.141
- What?
- I will.

18:18.827 --> 18:20.782
And I'll tell her I'm you...

18:21.707 --> 18:24.540
..and I'll do... terrible things to her.

18:27.226 --> 18:29.502
What sort of terrible things?

18:34.586 --> 18:36.418
(Claire moans)

18:41.387 --> 18:43.059
(groans)

19:08.028 --> 19:09.585
Oh, God!

19:11.708 --> 19:14.268
Oh, Doctor,...

19:15.389 --> 19:17.344
..you've cured me!

19:41.668 --> 19:43.626
(Claire sobs)

19:45.669 --> 19:47.226
Shh, shh.

19:47.309 --> 19:49.870
What's the matter, what's the matter?

19:57.709 --> 19:59.666
I'll never get pregnant.

20:03.030 --> 20:04.987
I'll never have children.

20:07.310 --> 20:10.143
When I'm dead... I'll just be dead.

20:14.390 --> 20:15.948
I'll...

20:16.830 --> 20:20.666
..really never have been a woman
at all. Just a girl.

20:22.590 --> 20:24.546
A little girl.

20:26.191 --> 20:28.624
You could always adopt a baby.

20:30.191 --> 20:34.547
It wouldn't be the same.
It wouldn't be part of my body.

20:35.031 --> 20:36.986
Yes... that's true.

20:39.512 --> 20:42.071
Don't tell. Please don't tell...

20:43.871 --> 20:46.830
..anybody about me. Please don't tell.

20:49.271 --> 20:53.025
I'm so vulnerable... I'm slashed open.

20:54.911 --> 20:57.472
Who would I tell? Eh?

21:01.711 --> 21:03.464
Who would I tell?

21:03.552 --> 21:08.909
(TV) And with that seal ofapproval,
our 5th bubbly season gets under way.

21:08.992 --> 21:10.948
(door opens)

21:12.032 --> 21:13.784
Hey, hey, hey,...

21:13.872 --> 21:15.829
..it's the swinger!

21:16.272 --> 21:18.228
Yeah... hi.

21:18.913 --> 21:20.869
So?

21:22.113 --> 21:23.671
Er, so...

21:24.673 --> 21:26.425
..it was nice.

21:27.472 --> 21:30.624
She's... a little crazy, but sweet.

21:32.233 --> 21:33.985
Tell me all about it.

21:34.074 --> 21:35.222
Later.

21:35.312 --> 21:38.908
No, now.
You might forget something later.

21:38.993 --> 21:40.949
Some yummy detail.

21:41.034 --> 21:43.025
I don't want to tell you about it.

21:43.113 --> 21:45.069
You don't what?

21:48.753 --> 21:51.109
- I want to keep it...
- (pours drink)

21:52.274 --> 21:54.025
..for myself.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.148
Listen,...

21:59.234 --> 22:02.943
..you haven't had any experience
until I've had it, too.

22:05.355 --> 22:09.142
You haven't fucked Claire Niveau
until you tell me about it.

22:09.233 --> 22:11.544
Then I haven't fucked Claire Niveau.

22:16.314 --> 22:19.226
There's no point to
this discussion, Arlene.

22:19.314 --> 22:22.307
There is a point.
There definitely is a point!

22:22.394 --> 22:25.784
You started with me
and now you won't carry through.

22:27.074 --> 22:29.508
And... we have a relationship!

22:30.315 --> 22:32.272
But you test out fine.

22:35.514 --> 22:38.075
It's your husband that's the problem,...

22:38.155 --> 22:41.148
..and all he probably needs
is a good sperm wash.

22:41.235 --> 22:45.229
If it's only a matter of laundry,
why are you opposed to doing it?

22:45.315 --> 22:47.272
We don't do husbands.

22:47.355 --> 22:52.509
We do female infertility.
We do women. That's our specialty.

22:52.595 --> 22:54.393
I am a woman...

22:54.475 --> 22:56.546
..and I want you to take care of me.

22:56.635 --> 22:58.149
I trust you.

22:58.235 --> 23:00.591
It's hard enough to find someone...

23:00.676 --> 23:03.907
..in the medical profession
that you can trust.

23:03.996 --> 23:09.149
Arlene, that's... that's wonderful.
I mean, that's really wonderful,...

23:09.236 --> 23:11.466
..but we don't do husbands.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.548
We don't deliver babies, either.

23:13.637 --> 23:16.275
We make women fertile,
and that's all we do.

23:20.157 --> 23:23.705
To achieve anything in life,
one has to keep life simple.

23:24.716 --> 23:26.275
Don't you think?

23:28.557 --> 23:30.309
Irrigation.

23:31.477 --> 23:36.153
It'd be an exaggeration to say we can
make up a new set of fallopian tubes...

23:36.236 --> 23:39.149
..using just anything that's handy.

23:41.717 --> 23:45.266
Those tubes are highly specialised
little organs.

23:45.757 --> 23:49.148
But with the kind of help
we can offer the process,...

23:49.238 --> 23:53.789
..it is possible to...
modify several other organs:

23:53.878 --> 23:55.833
..the odd vein,...

23:55.918 --> 23:57.476
..or, as today,...

23:57.558 --> 24:00.834
..we're using
a femoral lymphatic vessel...

24:00.918 --> 24:04.388
..to take over the function
of conveying the egg...

24:05.118 --> 24:07.473
..from the ovary to the uterus.

24:20.758 --> 24:22.511
What are you taking?

24:22.598 --> 24:24.555
Let me see.

24:24.639 --> 24:26.595
"Dextroamphetamine resin."

24:26.678 --> 24:29.557
"Dosage form: capsule."

24:29.638 --> 24:31.197
"7.5 milligrams."

24:31.278 --> 24:33.952
"Use: short-term treatment of obesity."

24:34.039 --> 24:38.191
"Minor side effects:
dry mouth, palpitations,...

24:38.279 --> 24:41.431
..restlessness,
unpleasant taste in mouth."

24:41.519 --> 24:43.475
"Major...

24:43.560 --> 24:45.516
..side effects:

24:53.799 --> 24:56.758
..sleeplessness, rapid heartbeat,...

24:58.319 --> 25:00.073
..euphoria."

25:02.839 --> 25:04.433
Do you want one?

25:05.200 --> 25:07.156
Where did you learn all that?

25:08.481 --> 25:12.996
Doctor, the Physician's Desk Reference
is my favourite bedside reading.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.195
As a matter of fact,...

25:15.280 --> 25:21.072
..they tell me that there's a high incidence
of drug use amongst doctors.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.594
- Is that true?
- Yep.

25:23.679 --> 25:25.433
Do you take drugs?

25:27.001 --> 25:28.353
No.

25:28.441 --> 25:30.033
Well, for pain.

25:31.241 --> 25:33.959
Pain creates character distortion.

25:35.761 --> 25:37.955
It's simply not necessary.

25:40.761 --> 25:42.831
I'm often in a lot of pain.

25:44.561 --> 25:46.836
What kind of pain?

25:48.640 --> 25:50.597
I think...

25:51.482 --> 25:53.552
..psychosexual.

25:56.801 --> 26:00.158
I'd say that was a pretty astute diagnosis.

26:00.802 --> 26:04.875
Though I wouldn't recommend you
using those for that condition.

26:04.962 --> 26:06.873
Who prescribed them for you?

26:08.603 --> 26:12.755
When you get to be a famous actress...
well, doctors are...

26:12.842 --> 26:14.798
..friendly.

26:16.922 --> 26:20.836
Do me a favour. Will you allow me
to do the prescribing for you?

26:24.082 --> 26:26.039
Thanks, Arthur.

26:31.043 --> 26:33.682
You've forgotten to sign this, Dr Mantle.

26:33.762 --> 26:35.117
Oh.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.321
Sorry.

26:39.484 --> 26:41.838
Actually, my name's Denis.

26:42.523 --> 26:45.083
Sorry. I always get you confused.

26:46.123 --> 26:47.955
Bye again.

26:48.043 --> 26:51.558
If I had a game of squash now, Terry,
I'd end up a dead man.

26:51.643 --> 26:54.522
I may win, but I'd be dead at the end of it.

26:56.244 --> 26:58.804
- Tired?
- Yeah, that last one was rough.

26:58.883 --> 27:01.637
- Were you there?
- No, I'll watch the tape.

27:01.723 --> 27:04.717
I'll need it to get the FT paper
in shape, anyway.

27:04.804 --> 27:06.759
Boston's yelling at me for it.

27:06.845 --> 27:10.757
Hello, Mary. Then I'll just need
your tissue rejection data.

27:10.844 --> 27:12.402
How's that coming along?

27:12.485 --> 27:16.442
Listen, how about I write the paper
one time and you collect the data?

27:16.525 --> 27:20.153
Sure. Just say when. Do you want
to see how it's shaping up?

27:20.245 --> 27:23.236
No, I trust you to make us look good.

27:29.645 --> 27:31.204
I'm exhausted.

27:31.285 --> 27:33.799
Too exhausted to see Claire tonight?

27:34.646 --> 27:36.600
No. Never.

27:37.605 --> 27:40.995
- You'll need these.
- What's that?

27:41.085 --> 27:43.235
Butazamine.

27:46.165 --> 27:49.920
She's heard that it makes sex
come on like Nagasaki.

27:50.005 --> 27:52.361
You're not feeding her pills, are you?

27:52.445 --> 27:54.402
Listen, baby brother,...

27:55.446 --> 27:59.485
..l've got her number.
This lady's hustling us for drugs.

28:01.205 --> 28:03.197
I don't think that's true at all.

28:03.286 --> 28:07.164
- I think we should drop her, Bev.
- You drop her!

28:14.966 --> 28:18.276
This is unknown territory
we're moving into.

28:20.166 --> 28:24.398
Just cos we're handcuffed together
doesn't mean I have to like you!

28:24.487 --> 28:25.919
Handcuffs?

28:26.006 --> 28:27.679
You don't get it, do you?

28:27.766 --> 28:29.325
Listen, honey-mud,...

28:29.407 --> 28:33.718
..we're on the run... and until we find
the release code to this thing...

28:33.808 --> 28:36.764
..we're gonna get to know
each other real well.

28:36.846 --> 28:39.760
I suggest we learn to like what we see.

28:41.848 --> 28:44.805
You're a very self-conscious reader.

28:46.167 --> 28:48.124
Just... Just loosen up...

28:48.208 --> 28:50.244
..and play.

28:50.328 --> 28:52.079
Come on.

28:54.288 --> 28:57.996
Didn't you ever do routines
as a kid? lmpersonations?

28:58.088 --> 29:01.558
The only impersonation I ever did
was my brother.

29:03.368 --> 29:06.121
I didn't know you had a brother.

29:08.088 --> 29:09.521
Yeah.

29:10.528 --> 29:12.280
We're not very close.

29:12.368 --> 29:15.281
Beverly... That's a woman's name.

29:16.648 --> 29:20.356
Why did your mom give you
a woman's name, I wonder?

29:20.448 --> 29:23.283
It's not a woman's name.
It's spelled differently.

29:23.369 --> 29:27.919
It's still a woman's name. Does your
brother have a woman's name, too?

29:28.009 --> 29:30.000
Merian... spelled with an E...

29:30.088 --> 29:31.681
..and an A.

29:31.770 --> 29:35.843
What are you trying to suggest?
That I'm gay or something?

29:35.929 --> 29:38.806
My mother wanted girls?

29:38.889 --> 29:42.599
What the fuck is this
bullshit psychoanalysis!

29:50.889 --> 29:53.608
Listen, Doctor,...

29:55.209 --> 29:58.360
..l think there's something
wrong with you.

29:59.009 --> 30:02.764
I don't know what it is,
I can't put a label on it, but...

30:03.810 --> 30:05.368
..you're subtly...

30:06.410 --> 30:08.162
..l don't know...

30:08.250 --> 30:10.081
..schizophrenic...

30:10.169 --> 30:12.126
..or something.

30:16.851 --> 30:19.319
Sometimes I like you very much...

30:20.130 --> 30:24.487
..and sometimes you're an amusing lay.
Not much more.

30:27.930 --> 30:29.887
And I can't figure out...

30:29.971 --> 30:31.722
..why.

30:47.650 --> 30:49.607
(whispers) Beverly.

30:53.691 --> 30:55.250
One for you.

30:58.011 --> 30:59.684
One for me.

31:11.572 --> 31:13.529
Please come this way.

31:21.572 --> 31:23.962
My dear...

31:26.692 --> 31:28.683
Sit down, have a drink,...

31:28.772 --> 31:30.729
..and tell me everything.

31:31.852 --> 31:33.809
I'm not sure I know everything.

31:33.893 --> 31:37.044
Start with all this
I've been hearing about you...

31:37.132 --> 31:39.806
..and the wonderful Mantle boys.

31:39.893 --> 31:41.644
What are you talking about?

31:43.093 --> 31:47.643
Claire, this is me - Laura.
Please don't be coy, it's tedious.

31:50.373 --> 31:52.330
Dear Beverly,...

31:52.413 --> 31:54.166
..dear Elliot.

31:54.253 --> 31:57.563
Some claim they can't
tell the difference,...

31:57.653 --> 32:01.249
..but not me, dear.
It's obvious to me that...

32:03.013 --> 32:07.405
Well, before I say anything gauche,
tell me which one you're seeing.

32:07.494 --> 32:09.690
You mean there's two of them?

32:09.774 --> 32:13.609
Don't be an ass, dear.
Of course there are two of them.

32:15.214 --> 32:17.171
They're twins, dear.

32:17.254 --> 32:20.008
Identical twins.

32:21.455 --> 32:24.207
My dear, you've gone absolutely pale.

32:25.815 --> 32:27.770
Have I said something?

32:27.854 --> 32:32.006
No, no, not at all.
Where's that waiter? I want some coffee.

32:33.374 --> 32:35.330
Oh, how sick-making.

32:36.934 --> 32:39.687
I have said something, haven't l?

32:39.774 --> 32:41.128
(thunder)

32:41.215 --> 32:44.174
You know,
I could get very fond of Butazamine.

32:44.255 --> 32:47.009
Ooooh...!

32:53.495 --> 32:55.052
Beverly,...

32:56.535 --> 33:00.608
..why haven't you told me that
your brother isn't just a brother?

33:00.697 --> 33:03.449
Ah, th... Ah, that.

33:03.536 --> 33:05.094
Yes, that.

33:06.136 --> 33:09.367
It never occurred to me.
I mean, he is just a brother.

33:09.456 --> 33:11.208
Um...

33:11.296 --> 33:13.857
- Is it important?
- Is it important?

33:14.896 --> 33:18.128
I've heard you live together
in the same apartment.

33:18.217 --> 33:19.967
Yeah, that's true.

33:21.096 --> 33:23.086
We both like ltalian furniture.

33:23.176 --> 33:25.531
God! Do you sleep in the same bed?

33:25.617 --> 33:27.413
Oh, Claire, come on!

33:27.496 --> 33:29.055
You come on!

33:29.136 --> 33:30.774
You told me...

33:30.857 --> 33:33.246
..you and your brother weren't close.

33:34.377 --> 33:39.326
And now I find out
not only are you identical twins,...

33:40.417 --> 33:42.372
..but you live together...

33:42.457 --> 33:44.413
..in the same apartment.

33:48.097 --> 33:49.849
What's he like,...

33:49.938 --> 33:51.576
..your twin?

33:56.937 --> 33:58.689
Well, I mean... er...

33:59.658 --> 34:01.808
Of course, h-he looks a lot like me.

34:03.058 --> 34:05.446
Are you identical psychologically?

34:05.538 --> 34:07.494
Um...

34:08.976 --> 34:11.047
No, I wouldn't say that.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.170
When can I meet him?

34:14.259 --> 34:16.215
You can't. I mean...

34:16.297 --> 34:18.255
..you don't want to.

34:20.739 --> 34:22.695
(thunder)

34:22.779 --> 34:25.737
But, Beverly... don't you understand?

34:29.257 --> 34:31.010
I have to meet him.

34:31.099 --> 34:32.248
Why?

34:32.339 --> 34:34.693
I want to know everything about you.

34:36.938 --> 34:38.896
I don't think it's a good idea.

34:38.978 --> 34:42.527
You don't want me to meet your twin.
Why is that?

34:42.619 --> 34:44.576
It's... It's difficult.

34:44.659 --> 34:46.217
It's very difficult.

34:46.299 --> 34:49.893
That's it, you see. I want to know
why it's difficult for you.

34:49.978 --> 34:53.255
- My button...
- It's important to me to know why.

35:02.340 --> 35:04.011
I suppose l...

35:04.101 --> 35:06.534
..l could arrange for you and...

35:06.620 --> 35:08.371
..Elliot...

35:09.780 --> 35:11.736
..to have a drink together.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.776
Uh-uh. Nix.

35:13.860 --> 35:15.657
No good.

35:15.740 --> 35:17.492
Why?

35:21.260 --> 35:23.854
I want to see you two together.

35:30.740 --> 35:33.699
I know he's going to have to in the end.

35:36.541 --> 35:38.497
- Ah, there you are.
- Here I am.

35:38.580 --> 35:41.221
I've been really looking forward to this.

35:41.301 --> 35:43.098
Well... er...

35:43.180 --> 35:44.933
Claire Niveau,...

35:45.021 --> 35:46.977
..this is my brother Elliot.

35:47.062 --> 35:51.373
Hi, Claire... I hope Bev's told you
what a big fan I am of your movies.

35:51.461 --> 35:55.420
No, he hasn't. As a matter of fact,
he hasn't mentioned you at all.

35:55.501 --> 35:57.857
Really? That's not very flattering.

35:59.222 --> 36:00.620
Well...

36:00.701 --> 36:02.454
Are you going to sit down?

36:02.541 --> 36:04.499
Yes, I am.

36:11.102 --> 36:15.220
I feel such a fool, actually.
I must be the only woman in town...

36:15.302 --> 36:18.612
..who doesn't know about
the fabulous Mantle twins.

36:19.662 --> 36:21.414
What are you drinking?

36:21.502 --> 36:26.896
Nothing. I want to be very sober right
at this moment. I want to be very clear.

36:33.703 --> 36:37.456
There really isn't any
telling you apart, is there?

36:37.544 --> 36:40.103
Absolutely identical in every respect.

36:40.262 --> 36:43.060
I'm actually a couple of millimetres taller.

36:45.624 --> 36:49.094
I bet somebody who knew you both -
how shall I put it? -

36:49.183 --> 36:52.334
..knew you both really well...

36:52.423 --> 36:54.379
..could tell the difference.

36:54.463 --> 36:57.899
Without measuring your height, I mean.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.736
What do you mean?

36:59.823 --> 37:04.022
Beverly's the sweet one,
and you're the shit. Am I right?

37:04.104 --> 37:08.620
This is some feisty lady
you've found, Beverly!

37:08.704 --> 37:13.732
Elliot, let's ease up on the bullshit for
a moment. You can be honest with me.

37:13.823 --> 37:16.384
After all, I am laying both of you, aren't l?

37:16.464 --> 37:17.942
Er, now, hang on a...

37:18.024 --> 37:20.413
It's a sweet little act you have.

37:20.505 --> 37:23.655
You soften them up
with all that smarmy concern...

37:23.744 --> 37:27.215
..and along comes Dracula here
and polishes them off.

37:30.464 --> 37:32.773
I was the one who fucked you first,...

37:32.864 --> 37:36.573
..but I gave you to my baby brother
because you weren't very good.

37:36.664 --> 37:38.814
Oh, God, no! Um... Claire,...

37:38.906 --> 37:40.656
..let me explain...

37:40.744 --> 37:42.974
You absolute shit!

37:43.065 --> 37:46.944
Explain what?! Explain... what?
Listen...

37:47.024 --> 37:52.622
I've been around a bit. I've seen some
creepy things in the movie business.

37:52.705 --> 37:55.981
This is the most disgusting thing
that's ever happened to me.

37:56.066 --> 37:58.863
- I doubt that.
- What is it with you, chum?

37:58.946 --> 38:02.494
You can't get it up
unless little brother's watching?

38:02.586 --> 38:04.542
I told you this was a bad idea.

38:06.505 --> 38:09.781
- Really stupid. I'm leaving.
- Don't bother.

38:19.067 --> 38:21.421
That solves that little problem.

38:23.025 --> 38:24.584
Jesus, Bev!

38:24.666 --> 38:26.225
Hey!

38:27.347 --> 38:30.702
- What's going on?
- I don't know, I'm... I'm... er...

38:30.786 --> 38:32.344
..a bit upset.

38:34.226 --> 38:37.424
Listen, I'll go and catch up with her.

38:37.506 --> 38:40.067
- I'll tell her it was all my fault.
- No!

38:42.708 --> 38:44.459
Leave her alone.

38:47.468 --> 38:49.776
I'll sort it out.

38:50.146 --> 38:53.663
I give you the winner
of the 1988 Feldman Award:

38:53.748 --> 38:56.306
Dr Elliot Mantle!

39:12.508 --> 39:15.818
I suppose all of us know
just how important it is...

39:15.908 --> 39:19.901
..for a practitioner to receive
the recognition of his peers.

39:21.068 --> 39:24.378
(Elliot) However,
I feel that this award tonight...

39:24.468 --> 39:26.822
..is not really for me,...

39:26.908 --> 39:30.025
..but rather for those women...

39:30.109 --> 39:33.384
..who have provided
that most precious thing:

39:33.469 --> 39:35.903
The gift of life.

39:44.629 --> 39:47.861
- I want to thank Dr Angus Lawson...
- Hi, how are you?

39:47.949 --> 39:51.339
..who gave me the time to pursue
my own research.

39:51.429 --> 39:55.661
But most of all
I want to thank my brother,...

39:55.748 --> 39:59.060
..my partner, Dr Beverly Mantle,...

39:59.149 --> 40:04.587
..who, true to form, is not here
wasting time basking in glory.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.706
Here, take mine.

40:06.789 --> 40:09.987
But is hard at work at the Mantle Clinic...

40:10.069 --> 40:12.025
Not true!

40:12.110 --> 40:14.464
Not true! I'm here!

40:20.310 --> 40:22.108
Oh, sorry.

40:25.990 --> 40:29.505
I see Beverly has been doing
a little basking, after all!

40:29.590 --> 40:31.343
He has a lot to celebrate.

40:31.431 --> 40:35.822
He has been recognised as one of
North America's leading clinicians.

40:35.911 --> 40:37.549
Ladies and gentlemen,...

40:37.630 --> 40:39.188
..Dr Beverly Mantle.

40:39.991 --> 40:42.631
- You all right?
- Had rather a lot to drink.

40:42.712 --> 40:44.667
Just want to say something.

40:44.751 --> 40:47.983
- I just want to say some...
- (microphone feedback)

40:48.992 --> 40:50.947
I just want to say something.

40:51.032 --> 40:52.988
(clears throat)

40:53.072 --> 40:56.507
There's been a fraud
perpetrated here tonight.

41:00.392 --> 41:02.542
The whole thing's a fraud!

41:05.911 --> 41:09.109
- He's Beverly and I'm Elliot!
- (laughter)

41:09.192 --> 41:11.581
- Just say thank you and get off.
- No!

41:11.672 --> 41:14.470
I want to say something else!

41:14.551 --> 41:16.986
A lot of you are probably wondering...

41:17.072 --> 41:19.028
..how we divide the work.

41:20.152 --> 41:22.108
Well, it's like this...

41:24.193 --> 41:26.945
I slave over the hot snatches...

41:27.032 --> 41:28.102
(gasps)

41:28.193 --> 41:31.582
..and Elliot... makes the speeches!

41:31.673 --> 41:33.106
For God's sake!

41:33.192 --> 41:38.220
I do everything for those bimbos, except
take them home and stick it in them!

41:38.312 --> 41:40.269
(audience gasps)

41:42.473 --> 41:46.864
Well, he's clearly been doing a lot
of celebrating. Who can blame him?

41:46.954 --> 41:48.909
Thank you so much. Thank you.

41:53.354 --> 41:55.309
(alarm clock beeping)

42:03.674 --> 42:05.630
(beeping grows louder)

42:07.594 --> 42:10.552
I'm sorry about the catastrophe
last night.

42:11.834 --> 42:15.986
It's true I had to smooth
a few ruffled feathers this morning.

42:16.074 --> 42:18.668
But now, baby brother,...

42:18.754 --> 42:20.312
..for the good news.

42:20.394 --> 42:21.827
Lawson has...

42:21.913 --> 42:26.227
..finally offered me the associate
professorship at the hospital.

42:26.314 --> 42:29.864
- One vodka martini, Doctor.
- Thank you, Sean.

42:30.634 --> 42:34.184
- Are you going to accept?
- Of course I'm going to accept.

42:34.275 --> 42:37.347
It's the next step to
chairman of the department.

42:37.434 --> 42:40.427
- What about the practice?
- It goes on as before.

42:40.514 --> 42:44.063
- Except you're not there.
- I won't be there as much, no.

42:48.234 --> 42:49.986
I'm not eating.

42:51.076 --> 42:53.430
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

42:59.275 --> 43:00.755
What are those?

43:00.835 --> 43:02.791
Dex. I'm tired.

43:02.875 --> 43:05.788
- Want one?
- Er... no, thanks.

43:05.875 --> 43:08.833
If I can fly around, teach,
and do research,...

43:08.915 --> 43:12.067
..surely you can find time
for a few more patients?

43:12.156 --> 43:14.874
Sure. Why not?

43:49.517 --> 43:51.075
Good God!

43:52.117 --> 43:55.666
- I didn't know you were here.
- Shh, shh. Elly's asleep.

43:56.757 --> 43:58.713
His plane doesn't go till noon.

43:59.838 --> 44:02.477
I didn't realise you two were so friendly.

44:02.557 --> 44:04.514
We're not so friendly.

44:09.637 --> 44:11.390
You gonna take a shower?

44:12.478 --> 44:13.831
Um...

44:14.957 --> 44:16.789
No, l... er...

44:16.877 --> 44:18.675
You go ahead.

44:20.038 --> 44:21.596
OK.

44:21.677 --> 44:23.110
See ya.

44:28.839 --> 44:32.514
It seems so... cold and empty.

44:32.598 --> 44:37.195
You can call it empty,
or you can call it clean, sculptural.

44:37.279 --> 44:41.830
It's a question of the individual
nervous system, I think.

44:41.919 --> 44:44.797
That presupposes one has
an individual nervous system.

44:44.878 --> 44:46.197
Please?

44:58.319 --> 45:00.469
Er... thank you, I'll...

45:00.559 --> 45:02.312
I'll think about it.

45:14.999 --> 45:16.559
Claire...

45:16.640 --> 45:17.994
Yes?

45:23.199 --> 45:24.349
Oh,...

45:26.121 --> 45:27.678
..it's you.

45:31.721 --> 45:35.679
Or should I say, which one of you is it?

45:35.761 --> 45:37.911
Please, Claire, don't.

45:42.041 --> 45:44.349
Are you still doing the mini-series?

45:44.440 --> 45:47.911
Re-shoots. The director didn't
know what he was doing.

46:01.402 --> 46:02.834
Well,...

46:04.162 --> 46:06.117
..tell me how sorry you are.

46:07.882 --> 46:09.838
Tell me how much you miss me.

46:13.002 --> 46:15.994
My brother and I have always
shared everything.

46:16.082 --> 46:17.640
I'm not a thing.

46:17.721 --> 46:19.678
I mean people,...

46:19.761 --> 46:21.513
..experiences.

46:22.721 --> 46:24.871
It's never bothered me before now.

46:26.802 --> 46:28.758
It's different with me, is it?

46:29.922 --> 46:31.276
Yes.

46:31.362 --> 46:33.115
Yes, it is.

46:38.762 --> 46:40.718
Is Elliot jealous of me?

46:44.802 --> 46:47.442
Is he worried
I'll steal you away from him?

46:48.522 --> 46:51.879
No, he offered to come
and talk to you for me,...

46:51.963 --> 46:53.919
..to patch things up.

46:54.004 --> 46:55.959
That would've been amusing.

46:56.042 --> 46:57.716
Why didn't he?

46:58.723 --> 47:00.476
I wouldn't let him.

47:00.563 --> 47:04.351
Were you afraid I might like him
as much as I like you?

47:05.483 --> 47:07.439
Or maybe,...

47:08.924 --> 47:11.074
..when it came down to it,...

47:13.404 --> 47:15.554
..l couldn't see the difference.

47:15.643 --> 47:17.554
No!

47:17.644 --> 47:20.442
It doesn't work that way between us.

47:20.844 --> 47:22.800
I think it does.

47:23.604 --> 47:26.243
I think you two have
never come to terms...

47:26.324 --> 47:29.873
..with the way it really
does work between you.

47:39.564 --> 47:42.841
(whispers) No! Not while he's here.

47:45.284 --> 47:47.241
I don't want him to see us.

47:48.285 --> 47:50.037
All right,...

47:50.126 --> 47:52.685
..l'll just... separate you.

47:54.085 --> 47:55.643
Separate us?

47:55.725 --> 47:57.681
What do you mean?

48:09.845 --> 48:11.598
(Beverly screams)

48:12.885 --> 48:16.242
Ohh! Ohh! No! No! No! No!

48:21.165 --> 48:22.725
What happened?

48:22.806 --> 48:25.115
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was dreaming.

48:25.206 --> 48:26.958
- What about?
- About Elliot.

48:27.767 --> 48:30.201
- What happened?
- Oh, don't! Don't!

48:30.286 --> 48:32.437
Don't... touch it.

48:32.526 --> 48:34.279
Come to bed.

48:35.167 --> 48:36.725
Oh, Claire,...

48:36.806 --> 48:40.163
..l don't want to dream that again.
I can't!

48:45.046 --> 48:46.605
Take one of these.

48:46.688 --> 48:48.246
- What's that?
- Seconal.

48:48.328 --> 48:50.397
I guarantee you, you won't dream.

49:12.728 --> 49:15.083
Don't let me dream that again.

49:17.289 --> 49:21.441
The message that clearly emerges
from these complex encounters...

49:21.528 --> 49:23.644
..between physician and patient...

49:23.728 --> 49:26.844
..is that there is not only
a place in the clinic,...

49:26.928 --> 49:32.002
..but a demand for a philosophy.
A philosophy which mixes...

49:32.089 --> 49:36.878
..compassionate curiosity
with social responsibility.

49:39.208 --> 49:41.769
They'll discover they're gonna have to.

49:41.849 --> 49:43.201
(door buzzer)

49:43.288 --> 49:44.846
Yeah.

49:44.929 --> 49:48.968
Yeah. Look, David, I've got to go.
I've got company.

49:49.049 --> 49:51.687
All right, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye.

50:02.370 --> 50:04.325
- Dr Elliot Mantle?
- Yes.

50:04.410 --> 50:06.639
Special order from Escort Embassy.

50:06.730 --> 50:08.481
I'm Mimsy...

50:08.569 --> 50:10.526
..and this is my sister Coral.

50:11.530 --> 50:12.882
Hi.

50:12.970 --> 50:15.403
Would you like some of this?

50:15.491 --> 50:17.048
Sure.

50:34.291 --> 50:37.646
Listen, so that I know
which one of you is which,...

50:39.731 --> 50:41.767
..l'd like you...

50:41.850 --> 50:44.239
- Coral.
- Coral.

50:44.330 --> 50:46.083
..to call me Elly...

50:46.731 --> 50:48.687
..and you, Mimsy,...

50:49.530 --> 50:51.805
..to call me Bev.

51:11.772 --> 51:13.728
- Oh, shit!
- (nurse) Watch it.

51:13.812 --> 51:16.202
(doctor) She's got it, Beverly.

51:18.172 --> 51:20.969
- (doctor) A near thing. You OK?
- Yes, I'm OK.

51:21.052 --> 51:24.362
(doctor) I thought you were
shaky there for a second.

51:28.612 --> 51:30.569
Beverly, it's past nine.

51:34.573 --> 51:37.132
You're late. You've gotta get up.

51:38.172 --> 51:40.128
I need something to get me up.

51:40.213 --> 51:42.169
You know where it is.

51:43.932 --> 51:46.891
Claire, will you call Danuta,...

51:46.973 --> 51:50.328
..tell her to cancel my first three patients.

51:52.133 --> 51:54.088
I'll never make it.

52:05.453 --> 52:07.012
Can't eat.

52:07.093 --> 52:09.733
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, I can't eat!

52:09.814 --> 52:11.964
If you don't know, I do.

52:12.054 --> 52:15.888
Too many sleepers last night,
that's what.

52:15.973 --> 52:17.930
Look who's talking.

52:18.014 --> 52:20.050
Maybe you ought to take a week off.

52:21.213 --> 52:23.170
Just stop everything.

52:24.374 --> 52:25.931
I'm serious.

52:26.014 --> 52:28.164
I'll talk to Elly when he gets back.

52:28.253 --> 52:31.644
- I couldn't do anything before then.
- Elliot is back.

52:34.254 --> 52:38.213
He... called here for you
while you were in the shower.

52:39.614 --> 52:41.172
You spoke to him?

52:41.255 --> 52:43.370
Well, I couldn't help it, could l?

52:44.535 --> 52:48.687
I explained to him that you were
staying here with me for a few days.

52:49.614 --> 52:51.367
How did he react?

52:52.735 --> 52:54.292
Civilised.

52:54.375 --> 52:58.050
He apologised... for the scene in the bar...

52:58.135 --> 53:01.572
..and I more or less...
accepted his apology.

53:02.614 --> 53:04.571
Where are you going?

53:04.655 --> 53:06.373
Leo's in town.

53:06.455 --> 53:08.412
I told you about Leo...

53:08.495 --> 53:10.451
..and my Georgia picture.

53:10.535 --> 53:12.208
We're close to a deal.

53:12.295 --> 53:14.253
Don't go. I want you to stay.

53:17.255 --> 53:18.813
Beverly,...

53:18.895 --> 53:20.453
..l can't.

53:20.537 --> 53:22.207
OK. Yeah.

53:28.096 --> 53:31.247
Um, could you tell me
which is the make-up trailer?

53:31.336 --> 53:33.896
- This one here?
- Who are you looking for?

53:33.975 --> 53:36.126
- Miss Niveau.
- She expecting you?

53:36.217 --> 53:37.968
Yes, she is.

53:47.258 --> 53:48.815
Fascinating stuff.

53:49.697 --> 53:52.814
Lucky old Bev.
He gets to rub up against the magic.

53:53.497 --> 53:55.488
He seems totally uninterested.

53:57.457 --> 53:59.209
Bev's not into art.

54:00.537 --> 54:02.096
You are?

54:02.177 --> 54:04.134
I'm into glamour,...

54:05.378 --> 54:07.333
..the art of glamour.

54:09.016 --> 54:10.770
Well, here it is.

54:21.978 --> 54:24.208
I was surprised you wanted to see me.

54:26.259 --> 54:28.214
Give us a few minutes, please.

54:39.619 --> 54:41.655
I like your brother very much,...

54:41.738 --> 54:44.299
..and I thought it would be good...

54:44.379 --> 54:46.938
..for you and me... to be friends...

54:48.379 --> 54:49.937
..if we can.

54:50.019 --> 54:51.974
I think we can.

54:54.139 --> 54:56.096
There's something else.

54:56.179 --> 55:01.047
I'm going away to do another film.
I'm worried about leaving Bev alone.

55:01.139 --> 55:03.095
Bev's not alone.

55:03.178 --> 55:05.932
No, you're right, he's not alone,...

55:07.099 --> 55:08.850
..but he's lonely,...

55:08.940 --> 55:10.895
..even with me.

55:10.979 --> 55:15.292
He's developing a serious drug problem.
Did you realise that?

55:15.379 --> 55:17.941
I thought you had the drug problem.

55:18.020 --> 55:19.975
It's an occupational hazard.

55:22.219 --> 55:24.177
The same goes for Beverly.

55:24.260 --> 55:26.853
You resent me tremendously, don't you?

55:26.941 --> 55:28.896
You contribute...

55:29.899 --> 55:33.211
..a confusing element
to the Mantle brothers' saga.

55:34.339 --> 55:36.296
Possibly a destructive one.

55:43.500 --> 55:45.252
It's not personal.

55:45.341 --> 55:47.297
I think you're terrific.

55:47.381 --> 55:50.930
But I just don't have a role
in the Mantle brothers' saga.

55:52.581 --> 55:54.139
I suppose,...

55:56.262 --> 55:58.217
..if you liked us both...

56:00.061 --> 56:01.813
..in the same way,...

56:03.461 --> 56:05.417
..it might make things easier.

56:09.901 --> 56:11.938
It has been known to happen.

56:12.021 --> 56:13.579
I'm sorry,...

56:13.661 --> 56:15.618
..but I can't.

56:23.861 --> 56:26.421
Am I really that different from Beverly?

56:31.743 --> 56:33.494
You really are.

56:42.383 --> 56:44.533
Claire, let me come to the airport.

56:44.622 --> 56:47.376
Beverly, please, no public goodbyes.

56:51.463 --> 56:53.418
Ten weeks is such a long time.

56:54.943 --> 56:56.502
I'll fly up...

56:56.583 --> 56:58.540
..whenever there's a break.

57:02.264 --> 57:03.821
Claire,...

57:06.383 --> 57:08.339
..let's not lose each other.

58:14.946 --> 58:17.460
Birchall, will you please explain...

58:17.546 --> 58:20.504
..to my director
and my wardrobe person...

58:20.585 --> 58:24.135
..l am not about to do this movie
dressed like a 10-dollar hooker.

58:24.226 --> 58:27.617
Miss Niveau is not about
to do this movie...

58:27.706 --> 58:30.425
..dressed like a 10-dollar hooker.

58:30.506 --> 58:31.825
Well...

58:31.906 --> 58:34.216
Claire, you will admit, at least,...

58:34.307 --> 58:38.458
..your character thinks of herself
as a kind of emotional hooker.

58:38.547 --> 58:40.502
Oh, I do more than admit it.

58:41.707 --> 58:46.462
I'm the one who pointed it out
to this... wardrobe person.

58:48.026 --> 58:51.143
But she's so bloody literal-minded.

58:51.226 --> 58:52.819
(woman sobs)

58:52.907 --> 58:56.263
Wardrobe person?
She called me "wardrobe person"!

58:56.347 --> 58:58.145
I know, I know.

58:58.227 --> 58:59.978
(phone rings)

59:00.067 --> 59:02.022
Hello. Niveau suite.

59:06.146 --> 59:07.943
Hello?

59:08.027 --> 59:09.983
Hello?

59:12.267 --> 59:15.498
Have you examined her... c-carefully yet?

59:15.588 --> 59:18.260
What? Who is this?

59:22.748 --> 59:24.703
I'm her gynaecologist.

59:25.667 --> 59:27.420
You're... what?

59:27.508 --> 59:29.816
I'm Claire Niveau's gynaecologist!

59:29.909 --> 59:33.583
Did you know that she was a trifurcate?

59:36.308 --> 59:39.061
I'd have to classify that as a mutation.

59:39.148 --> 59:41.104
What exactly is this?

59:42.148 --> 59:44.104
Is that you, Byron?

59:46.387 --> 59:51.337
Carefully lubricate the two
prime fingers of your right hand...

59:52.508 --> 59:54.261
..and insert them...

59:54.349 --> 59:56.909
..into Claire Niveau's vagina.

59:59.429 --> 01:00:02.387
Instead of feeling one cervical head,...

01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:06.024
..you will feel three.

01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:10.746
Basically, this means...

01:00:12.229 --> 01:00:14.982
..that you have been fucking a mutant!

01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:26.063
Oh, Doctor, I'm sorry,...

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:29.027
..l thought you were ready
to see Mrs Randall.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:35.386
Mrs Randall, please come and sit down.
I don't think we've met.

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:40.949
Let me introduce myself.
I'm one of the Mantle twins.

01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:44.784
The lesion, not surprisingly,...

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:47.862
..causes diffuse enlargement
of the cervix...

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:52.267
..and, of course, our old friend,
leucorrhoea.

01:00:53.271 --> 01:00:55.024
Until very recently,...

01:00:55.111 --> 01:00:59.423
..diagnosis tended to be done
after a histological examination...

01:00:59.511 --> 01:01:04.107
..of the removed organ. A case of
throwing the baby out with the bath water.

01:01:05.391 --> 01:01:09.782
I'm sorry, Doctor, but your brother
is waiting for you in your office.

01:01:09.871 --> 01:01:11.828
I think you'd better go see him.

01:01:15.512 --> 01:01:17.467
Bev, what are you doing here?

01:01:22.672 --> 01:01:24.231
What's wrong?

01:01:37.033 --> 01:01:39.102
I've been hiding out at Claire's.

01:01:41.871 --> 01:01:44.101
I've been hiding from you.

01:01:44.193 --> 01:01:45.706
Hiding?

01:01:45.792 --> 01:01:47.748
What are you talking about?

01:01:47.832 --> 01:01:49.585
I was afraid of...

01:01:54.913 --> 01:01:58.063
I was af... afraid you wouldn't
let me have her.

01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:01.385
Oh, that's crazy, Bev.

01:02:05.674 --> 01:02:07.629
It is crazy because...

01:02:11.153 --> 01:02:12.711
..yesterday...

01:02:19.714 --> 01:02:21.670
..yesterday...

01:02:23.954 --> 01:02:26.707
..l found out that she was having an affair.

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.669
She's unfaithful to me, Elly.

01:02:33.754 --> 01:02:36.314
Bev, you mustn't take it so seriously.

01:02:37.994 --> 01:02:39.950
She's a showbiz lady.

01:02:40.034 --> 01:02:41.990
What can you expect?

01:02:42.914 --> 01:02:44.869
I'm in love with her!

01:02:47.835 --> 01:02:50.668
I have to take it seriously.

01:02:59.635 --> 01:03:02.433
It can't be love
if it does this to you, can it?

01:03:05.956 --> 01:03:07.707
It can't be love, Bev.

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:13.627
You're right, Elly.

01:03:16.036 --> 01:03:18.185
I was hiding from the wrong person.

01:03:26.515 --> 01:03:29.951

by The Five Satins

01:03:40.196 --> 01:03:42.949

01:04:15.877 --> 01:04:17.231
Dance?

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:22.910
No.

01:04:23.837 --> 01:04:25.395
You go ahead.

01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:31.149
Go on, Bev, dance with the girl.

01:04:40.238 --> 01:04:42.194
(music) Before

01:04:42.838 --> 01:04:45.876
(music) The light

01:04:45.958 --> 01:04:47.915

(music) (backing singers)
ln the still ofthe night

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.513
(music) So before

01:05:35.601 --> 01:05:39.559
(music) The light

01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:42.518
(music) Hold me again

01:05:42.599 --> 01:05:44.955

(music) ln the still ofthe night

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:01.440
- What's the matter, Bev?
- I just can't.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.079
Bev, stay with us.

01:06:03.161 --> 01:06:04.480
Stay with me.

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:06.313
Bev!

01:06:26.281 --> 01:06:27.839
He collapsed.

01:06:41.762 --> 01:06:43.718
Fuck, he's not breathing!

01:06:47.482 --> 01:06:50.236
Don't touch him, he's my brother!

01:06:55.803 --> 01:06:57.361
Come on, Bev!

01:07:01.802 --> 01:07:03.361
Come on!

01:07:08.883 --> 01:07:10.839
(siren)

01:07:18.524 --> 01:07:20.478
- (Bev gasps)
- Bev?

01:07:20.563 --> 01:07:22.121
Bev!

01:07:25.163 --> 01:07:26.517
Elly,...

01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:29.199
..thank God you're here.

01:07:29.284 --> 01:07:31.036
(Elliot) Oh, God!

01:07:33.563 --> 01:07:35.316
Oh, Bev,...

01:07:36.364 --> 01:07:38.719
..look at you, you're a mess,...

01:07:38.803 --> 01:07:40.557
..you're a wreck.

01:07:41.404 --> 01:07:43.360
You could've had a stroke, Bev.

01:07:46.205 --> 01:07:48.435
You're lucky to be in one piece.

01:07:48.525 --> 01:07:50.879
One piece.

01:07:54.725 --> 01:07:56.476
Bev,...

01:07:56.565 --> 01:07:59.921
..we can't let anyone know
about the drugs.

01:08:01.165 --> 01:08:03.519
If that gets out, we're finished.

01:08:04.645 --> 01:08:07.000
How... would they know?

01:08:08.164 --> 01:08:11.953
I had to fight them off to stop them
taking a blood sample,...

01:08:12.045 --> 01:08:14.354
..but I can't stay here day and night.

01:08:14.445 --> 01:08:18.073
I've got to get you off the pills
without anybody knowing.

01:08:24.325 --> 01:08:26.759
Do you think I'm really addicted?

01:08:34.886 --> 01:08:39.002
I'll put you on a detox programme.
I'll supervise it myself.

01:08:58.687 --> 01:09:00.246
There you go.

01:09:09.206 --> 01:09:13.645
- Darling, tell me what's going on.
- Mother, I'm at the end ofmy rope!

01:09:13.728 --> 01:09:16.764
I cannot live in that house
another second!

01:09:16.845 --> 01:09:19.999
Every relationship
has its ups and downs, dear.

01:09:20.087 --> 01:09:21.645
You and Tommy...

01:09:22.767 --> 01:09:26.158
Bev, there's a couple of things
we're gonna have to...

01:09:26.966 --> 01:09:29.323
Why are you taking that apart?

01:09:29.408 --> 01:09:31.966
Elly... I can't sleep.

01:09:32.048 --> 01:09:36.200
If you're asking me for a sleeper,
you're not gonna get one.

01:09:36.287 --> 01:09:38.040
What am I gonna do, then?

01:09:38.127 --> 01:09:39.881
You'll stay up.

01:09:45.687 --> 01:09:48.249
Elly, I'll die if I don't sleep!

01:09:48.328 --> 01:09:49.647
You'll stay up.

01:09:49.728 --> 01:09:52.082
What if I take something
when you go home?

01:09:52.167 --> 01:09:53.317
I'm staying here.

01:09:53.408 --> 01:09:56.161
What if I take something
when you go to sleep?

01:09:56.247 --> 01:09:58.045
- I won't.
- How will you stay awake?

01:09:58.128 --> 01:10:00.244
I'll take something!

01:10:00.327 --> 01:10:03.685
You'll take an up
so that I don't take a down?

01:10:03.768 --> 01:10:05.999
- This is crazy!
- Bev...

01:10:06.089 --> 01:10:08.239
Don't worry about me. I'm not you.

01:10:10.129 --> 01:10:12.484
And don't destroy that.

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:16.760
Ow, that really hurts.

01:10:21.049 --> 01:10:22.402
This?

01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:29.562
This... hurts?

01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:32.847
I don't know exactly
what it is that's hurting...

01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:41.122
Mrs Bookman,
this is a solid gold Mantle retractor.

01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:42.962
Solid gold!

01:10:43.051 --> 01:10:45.007
It's the best there is.

01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:47.525
This clinic's the best there is!

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:49.168
I mean,...

01:10:49.251 --> 01:10:51.207
..we have the technology.

01:10:57.491 --> 01:11:00.722
- It couldn't possibly hurt.
- I-l didn't mean to...

01:11:00.811 --> 01:11:02.767
When did you last have a period?

01:11:02.851 --> 01:11:05.524
I haven't had one in four or five months.

01:11:05.611 --> 01:11:09.763
And does it... hurt...
when you have intercourse?

01:11:11.211 --> 01:11:12.769
Yes, it does.

01:11:23.892 --> 01:11:25.848
(door closes outside)

01:11:32.693 --> 01:11:34.250
Where was l?

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:37.608
You... asked me whether or not it hurt...

01:11:37.691 --> 01:11:39.921
- ..when I had intercourse...
- Yes.

01:11:45.292 --> 01:11:49.252
What exactly did you have
intercourse with?

01:11:50.693 --> 01:11:52.444
What do you mean?

01:11:53.812 --> 01:11:55.370
I just wondered.

01:11:58.213 --> 01:11:59.965
I was once asked...

01:12:01.053 --> 01:12:02.610
..to treat a woman...

01:12:02.692 --> 01:12:05.844
..who had had... intercourse...

01:12:07.733 --> 01:12:09.689
..with a Labrador retriever.

01:12:12.613 --> 01:12:14.366
I thought...

01:12:16.174 --> 01:12:17.527
..maybe...

01:12:19.894 --> 01:12:21.849
You used this on Mrs Bookman?

01:12:21.934 --> 01:12:23.491
Yes.

01:12:23.573 --> 01:12:27.691
Bev... this is not for internals,
remember?

01:12:27.773 --> 01:12:31.322
This is for surgical retraction.
No wonder it hurt her!

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:33.769
No, no, it's not the...

01:12:33.853 --> 01:12:37.847
There's nothing the matter
with the instrument! It's the body!

01:12:39.334 --> 01:12:41.290
The woman's body was all wrong!

01:13:09.974 --> 01:13:13.854
(woman) Yes, I think you'll find
his work quite interesting.

01:13:15.015 --> 01:13:17.733
Why don't you drop by
later on this evening?

01:13:19.295 --> 01:13:21.048
Just a moment, please.

01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:22.488
May I help you?

01:13:22.575 --> 01:13:25.726
I wonder if you could
put me in touch with Mr Wolleck.

01:13:25.815 --> 01:13:30.367
Perfect timing. Mr Wolleck is right
over there working on a new piece.

01:13:30.455 --> 01:13:35.211
- That's Mr Wolleck? He works here?
- Mm-hm. It's part of his show.

01:13:37.015 --> 01:13:38.972
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

01:13:39.056 --> 01:13:42.014
I was wondering
if you could help me with these.

01:13:46.616 --> 01:13:48.571
(Wolleck) Fascinating.

01:13:48.656 --> 01:13:50.612
They're quite beautiful.

01:13:51.455 --> 01:13:53.014
What are they?

01:13:53.097 --> 01:13:55.611
They're gynaecological instruments...

01:13:55.696 --> 01:13:57.846
..for working on mutant women.

01:13:57.937 --> 01:13:59.893
Mutant women?

01:14:05.096 --> 01:14:07.611
That's a great theme for a show.

01:14:07.697 --> 01:14:10.130
No, it's not for a show. It's not art.

01:14:11.177 --> 01:14:13.407
I'm a doctor, I need them for my work.

01:14:13.497 --> 01:14:15.452
That's a little out of my line.

01:14:16.217 --> 01:14:17.570
What do you want me to do?

01:14:17.657 --> 01:14:21.207
Well, I need
three-dimensional prototypes...

01:14:21.297 --> 01:14:23.253
..in surgical steel,...

01:14:23.338 --> 01:14:25.293
..cast,...

01:14:25.377 --> 01:14:27.334
..hand-finished,...

01:14:27.418 --> 01:14:29.373
..functioning.

01:14:29.457 --> 01:14:31.414
And I thought maybe...

01:14:31.498 --> 01:14:34.375
Aren't there large companies
in this town...

01:14:34.457 --> 01:14:36.813
No! No, no, no, I can't go to them!

01:14:36.897 --> 01:14:38.854
It's too radical for them!

01:14:38.938 --> 01:14:40.894
We've always been too radical.

01:14:41.898 --> 01:14:43.855
I mean... I can't!

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:46.088
It's too... It's too complicated.

01:14:48.777 --> 01:14:51.657
I think maybe we could...
work something out.

01:14:53.459 --> 01:14:56.292
I've had it with the bullshit
from this office!

01:14:56.379 --> 01:15:00.735
I've asked you ten times to transfer
my wife's records to the Mount Sinai.

01:15:00.819 --> 01:15:04.333
You haven't done it.
They refuse to admit her without them.

01:15:04.419 --> 01:15:06.409
- What is going on?
- I'm so sorry.

01:15:06.498 --> 01:15:09.093
The doctors assured me they'd been sent.

01:15:09.179 --> 01:15:12.933
Bullshit! I want those files
in my hand before I leave!

01:15:13.019 --> 01:15:16.056
Mr Glaser, I assure you
I'll do everything I can.

01:15:16.139 --> 01:15:17.697
(knock at door)

01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:19.531
(mumbles) Not now.

01:15:19.619 --> 01:15:22.133
(Danuta) Doctor, I have to speak to you.

01:15:22.219 --> 01:15:24.174
Not now!

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:36.215
Doctor, I'm... giving you my notice.
I won't work under these conditions.

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:51.978
Fine.

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.054
Fine.

01:16:33.782 --> 01:16:35.932
(surgeon) We're all set, Beverly.

01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:48.700
We'll use these.

01:16:51.461 --> 01:16:54.535
(Beverly) Give us the tools
and we will do the job.

01:16:56.543 --> 01:16:59.182
(nurse)
l-l'm afraid I'm not familiar...

01:16:59.262 --> 01:17:01.493
..with these instruments, Doctor.

01:17:02.583 --> 01:17:04.538
I've just had them made.

01:17:04.623 --> 01:17:06.579
They're brand-new.

01:17:07.543 --> 01:17:10.136
Well... number them...

01:17:10.223 --> 01:17:14.535
- ..one to ten, from left to right.
- (Beverly bangs the table)

01:17:14.623 --> 01:17:17.183
Give me the one... that I ask for.

01:17:19.103 --> 01:17:20.660
Give me number five.

01:17:22.943 --> 01:17:27.096
- (shouts) Now, please!
- Yes... number five.

01:17:28.983 --> 01:17:30.542
Number five.

01:17:36.664 --> 01:17:38.222
No...!

01:17:39.424 --> 01:17:41.415
Jesus Christ, Beverly!

01:17:43.303 --> 01:17:46.661
I've got...
I've got to slow everything down.

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:51.619
I need something
to slow everything down...

01:17:56.345 --> 01:17:57.902
(surgeon) Let go!

01:17:59.784 --> 01:18:04.062
- Oh, my God, she's bleeding!
- Get a clamp, for God's sake!

01:18:04.144 --> 01:18:07.103
(surgeon shouts)
Get him the hell outta here!

01:18:10.745 --> 01:18:14.181
I am more than willing
to apologise for my behaviour.

01:18:16.704 --> 01:18:18.855
I have been working too hard. I...

01:18:20.105 --> 01:18:24.065
I must be more realistic about...
my energy levels, and...

01:18:24.904 --> 01:18:27.294
..about my ability to concentrate...

01:18:27.386 --> 01:18:30.344
..for long periods of time under pressure.

01:18:33.466 --> 01:18:35.216
I must add, however,...

01:18:35.306 --> 01:18:38.854
..these accusations arise
out of a lack of understanding...

01:18:38.945 --> 01:18:42.301
..of the radical techniques
my brother and I are known for.

01:18:42.386 --> 01:18:47.016
And I think there's a certain amount
of professional jealousy involved...

01:18:49.906 --> 01:18:51.464
..as well.

01:18:55.386 --> 01:18:57.139
That's fine, sir.

01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:04.178
We always intended to ease ourselves
into pure research, anyway.

01:19:05.227 --> 01:19:06.579
No.

01:19:10.306 --> 01:19:14.266
I don't think that'll be necessary.
You have our cooperation.

01:19:22.667 --> 01:19:24.623
They didn't buy it, Bev.

01:19:24.707 --> 01:19:26.663
I think they knew it was me.

01:19:28.187 --> 01:19:30.748
They said we could've killed her.

01:19:33.307 --> 01:19:35.457
They said the woman could've died.

01:19:35.547 --> 01:19:37.266
They're lying!

01:19:37.348 --> 01:19:39.303
They've always been jealous.

01:19:39.387 --> 01:19:42.141
They won't revoke
our hospital privileges...

01:19:42.228 --> 01:19:44.616
..as long as we don't ever use them again.

01:19:44.708 --> 01:19:46.266
Fuck 'em!

01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:49.624
We always planned to ease ourselves
into pure research.

01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:52.461
I certainly always planned it. Didn't you?

01:20:07.509 --> 01:20:09.977
There seems to be some problem about...

01:20:11.029 --> 01:20:12.586
..surgical instruments.

01:20:14.548 --> 01:20:17.780
About holding them as evidence
of a disturbed mind.

01:20:27.109 --> 01:20:29.577
Do you know what they're talking about?

01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:32.024
I tried to tell you, Elly!

01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:36.068
You don't know the kind of patients
we've been getting lately.

01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:38.983
You don't know what's going on out there.

01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:41.344
The patients are getting strange.

01:20:43.869 --> 01:20:46.258
They look all right on the outside,...

01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:48.102
..but their insides,...

01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:51.748
..they're deformed.

01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:54.264
Well, I had to deal with it somehow!

01:20:57.190 --> 01:20:59.340
Radical technology was required!

01:21:03.311 --> 01:21:05.063
You're right, Bev.

01:21:06.031 --> 01:21:08.828
Something radical is definitely required.

01:21:43.552 --> 01:21:46.782
Right, I want you to take...
three of these now.

01:21:50.112 --> 01:21:52.910
Take three around seven
this evening,...

01:21:54.112 --> 01:21:56.182
..three before you go to sleep,...

01:21:56.272 --> 01:21:59.026
..and three when you wake up
in the morning.

01:21:59.112 --> 01:22:01.262
Yes, Doctor!

01:22:01.353 --> 01:22:05.585
Can I trust you to do that, or have
I got to sit here and watch you?

01:22:05.672 --> 01:22:07.230
I don't know.

01:22:09.273 --> 01:22:11.104
Can you trust me?

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:13.545
Oh, God!

01:22:14.473 --> 01:22:16.429
Don't do this to me, Bev.

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:19.793
But I'm only doing it to me, Elly.

01:22:24.393 --> 01:22:26.749
Don't you have a will of your own?

01:22:29.952 --> 01:22:35.711
Why don't you just go on
with your very own life?

01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:40.752
Do you remember
the original Siamese twins?

01:22:42.793 --> 01:22:44.546
Chang and Eng.

01:22:45.435 --> 01:22:47.789
They were joined at the chest.

01:22:51.314 --> 01:22:53.270
Remember how they died?

01:22:54.514 --> 01:22:55.663
Mm.

01:22:56.714 --> 01:22:58.148
Chang...

01:22:58.235 --> 01:23:00.589
..died of a stroke...

01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:02.825
..in the middle of the night.

01:23:02.914 --> 01:23:05.348
He was always the sickly one.

01:23:06.235 --> 01:23:11.183
He was always the one
who drank too much.

01:23:11.274 --> 01:23:14.824
When Eng woke up beside him...

01:23:14.915 --> 01:23:18.066
..and found that his brother was dead,...

01:23:21.435 --> 01:23:23.391
..he died of fright...

01:23:26.316 --> 01:23:29.036
..right there in the bed.

01:23:32.315 --> 01:23:35.353
Does that answer your question?

01:23:38.635 --> 01:23:40.591
Poor Elly.

01:23:41.996 --> 01:23:44.715
Poor Bev.

01:24:36.197 --> 01:24:40.077
Everything's under control.
I don't see what the problem is.

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:44.549
Now the hospital's getting complaints
about your private practice.

01:24:44.637 --> 01:24:48.915
They've even approached me.
Informally, of course.

01:24:48.997 --> 01:24:50.953
Off the record, of course.

01:24:52.159 --> 01:24:56.151
They asked me all about Bev:
ls he a junkie? Everything.

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:59.517
Of course, you didn't tell them anything.

01:25:01.958 --> 01:25:03.914
Of course not.

01:25:03.999 --> 01:25:08.754
But you can't go on insulating yourselves.
They're gonna nail you.

01:25:08.838 --> 01:25:13.992
- They're gonna be forcedto nail you.
- The clinic's none of their business.

01:25:16.198 --> 01:25:20.350
Wow, it's getting hard
to tell the two of you apart.

01:25:26.079 --> 01:25:28.035
What did you do that for?

01:25:28.119 --> 01:25:30.553
It's my favourite fucking programme!

01:25:30.638 --> 01:25:32.595
Elly, Elly, Elly,...

01:25:32.679 --> 01:25:35.432
..you haven't done anything wrong.

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.037
Look, your reputation's
separate from Bev's.

01:25:39.119 --> 01:25:41.075
You've still got a career.

01:25:41.159 --> 01:25:42.718
Cary,...

01:25:46.041 --> 01:25:49.191
..my brother's research
is the basis of my career.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.798
I need him.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.073
Besides,...

01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:58.634
..the truth is, nobody can tell us apart.

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.834
We are perceived as one person.

01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:08.319
If Bev goes down the tubes, I go with him.

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.633
I've got to get him back.

01:26:12.881 --> 01:26:15.315
I think that's too dangerous for you.

01:26:15.841 --> 01:26:19.834
I think you're the last person on earth
who should try to do that.

01:26:19.921 --> 01:26:22.151
You've got to stay away from him now.

01:26:22.921 --> 01:26:25.229
Sure, go find him some help,...

01:26:25.321 --> 01:26:29.872
..but, for God's sakes, Elliot,
you've got to cut yourself loose.

01:26:29.962 --> 01:26:31.918
- It wouldn't work.
- Why?

01:26:32.001 --> 01:26:34.357
Look, don't you get it yet?

01:26:35.081 --> 01:26:39.040
Whatever's in his bloodstream
goes directly into mine.

01:26:41.642 --> 01:26:43.393
You can't be serious.

01:26:44.202 --> 01:26:47.080
That is an objective medical observation.

01:26:47.161 --> 01:26:48.720
No, no!

01:26:48.802 --> 01:26:52.511
No, it's not true.
You're making it true, but it's not true.

01:26:52.602 --> 01:26:57.153
You don't put these in your mouth,
they don't end up in your bloodstream!

01:27:03.963 --> 01:27:06.760
Beverly and I just have
to get synchronised.

01:27:10.243 --> 01:27:12.802
Once we're synchronised, it'll be easy.

01:27:32.163 --> 01:27:34.916
- (slurred) Hello?
- Who's this?

01:27:38.723 --> 01:27:40.476
It's Beverly.

01:27:40.564 --> 01:27:42.713
Beverly, it's Claire.

01:27:43.483 --> 01:27:45.042
I'm back.

01:27:46.004 --> 01:27:47.436
Claire?

01:27:47.524 --> 01:27:50.482
Beverly, why haven't I
been able to reach you?

01:27:50.563 --> 01:27:52.394
Why haven't you called me?

01:27:52.483 --> 01:27:54.236
(sobs)

01:27:54.324 --> 01:27:56.280
Claire,...

01:27:58.004 --> 01:27:59.959
..why did you betray me?

01:28:00.044 --> 01:28:01.999
What are you talking about?

01:28:04.604 --> 01:28:05.958
That...

01:28:07.204 --> 01:28:08.956
That man...

01:28:10.164 --> 01:28:12.121
That man in your hotel room.

01:28:12.205 --> 01:28:13.239
(sobs)

01:28:13.324 --> 01:28:15.076
Ohh!

01:28:15.165 --> 01:28:16.917
My God!

01:28:17.005 --> 01:28:18.960
Was that you who called?

01:28:19.045 --> 01:28:22.197
That was my secretary - Birchall.

01:28:22.925 --> 01:28:24.677
He's defiantly gay,...

01:28:24.764 --> 01:28:27.723
..and you managed
to gross him out completely.

01:28:27.805 --> 01:28:29.761
(sobs)

01:28:29.844 --> 01:28:31.836
Beverly,...

01:28:31.925 --> 01:28:33.678
..l want you to come and see me.

01:28:35.206 --> 01:28:37.161
Come to me right now.

01:28:41.046 --> 01:28:43.002
(running water)

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:07.759
(phone rings)

01:29:09.767 --> 01:29:11.325
Yeah?

01:29:11.406 --> 01:29:13.363
- Mr Virdo?
- Uh-huh.

01:29:13.446 --> 01:29:16.008
- This is Dr Mantle.
- Oh, yeah.

01:29:16.647 --> 01:29:19.445
I know this sounds awfully silly,...

01:29:19.527 --> 01:29:23.487
..but I'm afraid I've...
There's been a terrible mix-up.

01:29:23.567 --> 01:29:26.560
I've locked myself... into the clinic.

01:29:27.406 --> 01:29:32.528
Um... I was wondering ifyou'd mind
coming up and... and letting me out.

01:29:33.727 --> 01:29:35.479
I'll be right there.

01:29:40.207 --> 01:29:41.959
Dr Mantle,...

01:29:42.048 --> 01:29:43.605
..Lee Virdo.

01:29:49.368 --> 01:29:51.359
- Er...
- Just a minute, Mr Virdo.

01:29:51.448 --> 01:29:54.406
OK. I think there's...
something stuck there.

01:29:54.487 --> 01:29:56.479
(Beverly unlocks safety chain)

01:29:58.689 --> 01:30:00.643
What's going on in there?

01:30:02.488 --> 01:30:04.046
You know...

01:30:04.128 --> 01:30:05.881
Endless renovations.

01:30:06.169 --> 01:30:07.727
Oh, yeah.

01:30:11.929 --> 01:30:14.284
Um... You'd better lock it.

01:30:14.369 --> 01:30:16.324
Yeah, sure.

01:30:23.369 --> 01:30:25.929
- Are you coming down?
- Yeah.

01:30:30.530 --> 01:30:32.282
Are you all right?

01:30:33.329 --> 01:30:34.683
Yes,...

01:30:34.769 --> 01:30:36.521
..l'm fine.

01:30:36.609 --> 01:30:39.170
- You don't look so hot.
- I'm fine!

01:30:41.210 --> 01:30:42.767
Thank you.

01:30:42.849 --> 01:30:44.602
You're the doctor.

01:31:30.811 --> 01:31:33.200
(woman)
Excuse me, what are you doing?

01:31:33.291 --> 01:31:35.521
- They're mine!
- They've been sold!

01:31:35.612 --> 01:31:38.170
I'm taking them.
He's made another copy!

01:31:38.250 --> 01:31:40.606
They're mine and I'm taking them!

01:31:41.651 --> 01:31:43.404
They're not yours!

01:31:44.971 --> 01:31:46.723
They're not yours!

01:31:52.652 --> 01:31:54.005
Claire!

01:31:55.091 --> 01:31:56.445
Claire!

01:31:58.771 --> 01:32:01.332
Beverly, my love,
what's wrong with you?

01:32:01.413 --> 01:32:03.368
I've got to have some Seconal.

01:32:03.452 --> 01:32:05.727
- I'm sorry...
- I've got to have some!

01:32:05.812 --> 01:32:07.962
- I don't have anything at all.
- Oh!

01:32:08.052 --> 01:32:09.805
Oh, fuck!

01:32:12.294 --> 01:32:14.443
- (whispers) It's all right.
- No!

01:32:20.172 --> 01:32:22.323
I'll write a prescription for you.

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.330
They'll fill it for you.

01:32:29.453 --> 01:32:32.206
- I've got to have them, Claire!
- Oui.

01:32:32.853 --> 01:32:35.287
Don't tell Elliot... that I'm here.

01:32:36.333 --> 01:32:37.891
Why?

01:32:39.334 --> 01:32:41.289
I think he's becoming...

01:32:42.333 --> 01:32:44.086
..a drug addict.

01:32:45.334 --> 01:32:48.406
(whispers)
I think he's becoming... dangerous.

01:33:25.695 --> 01:33:27.651
Are you sure he didn't call?

01:33:27.735 --> 01:33:29.487
(Claire) I'm sure.

01:33:32.935 --> 01:33:34.687
It's not like Elliot.

01:33:37.456 --> 01:33:39.014
It's been...

01:33:39.095 --> 01:33:41.052
It's been almost a week.

01:33:42.894 --> 01:33:47.731
You know Elliot. I would've expected
him to be kicking the door in by now.

01:33:47.816 --> 01:33:50.330
Well, I haven't heard a word from him.

01:33:59.295 --> 01:34:01.252
Didn't call when I was asleep?

01:34:01.336 --> 01:34:02.689
No.

01:34:13.576 --> 01:34:15.329
Tell me about...

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:16.769
..these...

01:34:18.656 --> 01:34:20.214
..these tools.

01:34:22.896 --> 01:34:24.329
Tools?

01:34:28.737 --> 01:34:30.887
Surgical... instruments.

01:34:32.497 --> 01:34:35.057
You had them with you when you came.

01:34:35.537 --> 01:34:37.095
Did l?

01:34:38.257 --> 01:34:39.406
Yes.

01:34:45.777 --> 01:34:47.336
What are they for?

01:34:47.418 --> 01:34:50.171
They're for separating Siamese twins.

01:34:54.698 --> 01:34:56.256
I must go back.

01:34:58.018 --> 01:35:00.816
Don't go back. Stay here.

01:35:00.898 --> 01:35:03.048
I must go now. I'll take these.

01:35:08.538 --> 01:35:10.096
I'll come back.

01:35:11.977 --> 01:35:14.334
Your brother won't let you come back.

01:35:14.418 --> 01:35:16.375
(Claire cries)

01:35:16.459 --> 01:35:18.414
How could he stop me?

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:01.737
(running water)

01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:04.816
(turns offtaps)

01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:21.174
(running water)

01:36:51.182 --> 01:36:54.332
(mock American accent)
Hey... welcome home, kid.

01:36:57.222 --> 01:37:00.100
We've got to take a shot
of Dilantin tonight...

01:37:00.942 --> 01:37:02.933
..otherwise we might convulse.

01:37:03.022 --> 01:37:04.580
Right.

01:37:06.382 --> 01:37:07.941
Don't forget.

01:37:08.903 --> 01:37:10.460
Right.

01:37:10.542 --> 01:37:13.580
Then we go to Percodan in the morning.

01:37:14.823 --> 01:37:16.381
Mm, right.

01:37:20.103 --> 01:37:23.982
Then, in the afternoon,
we have a little treat.

01:37:24.942 --> 01:37:27.503
Dilaudid. Just because it's Saturday.

01:37:29.384 --> 01:37:31.817
So on Monday, we kick, right?

01:37:32.823 --> 01:37:34.382
We agreed.

01:37:34.463 --> 01:37:37.820
We have to start
to pull things back together then.

01:37:37.903 --> 01:37:39.461
Oh, yes,...

01:37:39.542 --> 01:37:42.216
..on Monday we definitely kick.

01:37:43.703 --> 01:37:45.455
How about some cake?

01:37:46.503 --> 01:37:48.256
I could go for that.

01:38:04.103 --> 01:38:05.857
And some orange pop.

01:38:09.344 --> 01:38:11.096
Some ice cream.

01:38:11.184 --> 01:38:13.414
We haven't got any ice cream, Elly.

01:38:15.344 --> 01:38:18.303
- Mummy forgot to buy it.
- (Elliot coughs)

01:38:23.265 --> 01:38:24.823
I want...

01:38:24.905 --> 01:38:27.259
..some ice cream!

01:38:39.345 --> 01:38:41.098
Happy birthday, Elly.

01:38:47.705 --> 01:38:49.661
It's not our birthday, Bev.

01:38:51.626 --> 01:38:53.980
Yes, it is.

01:38:59.985 --> 01:39:02.341
Happy birthday, baby brother.

01:39:24.587 --> 01:39:28.546
We are about to separate
the Siamese twins.

01:39:40.988 --> 01:39:43.502
Don't forget the good part!

01:39:46.987 --> 01:39:48.545
Oh, yes!

01:39:54.267 --> 01:39:59.023
Chang was always most concerned
about dulling the pain.

01:40:16.628 --> 01:40:18.380
Don't waste it.

01:40:30.789 --> 01:40:32.746
Tell me when it takes effect.

01:40:32.829 --> 01:40:35.502
I don't think I'll notice anything.

01:40:37.149 --> 01:40:39.106
You can start when you like.

01:41:24.951 --> 01:41:26.702
Do you think...

01:41:26.792 --> 01:41:29.782
..the morticulator is required, Eng?

01:41:31.751 --> 01:41:33.310
I think...

01:41:34.711 --> 01:41:37.101
..everything is required, Chang.

01:41:43.391 --> 01:41:46.463
Why are you crying?

01:41:51.032 --> 01:41:52.987
Separation can be...

01:41:56.432 --> 01:41:58.388
..a terrifying thing.

01:42:01.472 --> 01:42:03.428
Don't worry, baby brother,...

01:42:05.552 --> 01:42:07.507
..we'll always...

01:42:09.432 --> 01:42:11.992
We'll always be together.

01:43:08.994 --> 01:43:10.346
Elly?

01:43:11.954 --> 01:43:13.910
I had a terrible dream.

01:43:16.674 --> 01:43:18.427
Elly?

01:43:26.874 --> 01:43:28.228
Elly...

01:43:39.955 --> 01:43:41.308
Elly?

01:43:42.355 --> 01:43:43.708
Elly!

01:43:46.276 --> 01:43:50.235
Elly... Elly... Elly...

01:43:52.356 --> 01:43:54.505
Elly... Elly...

01:43:55.636 --> 01:43:57.991
Elly... Elly...

01:43:59.036 --> 01:44:01.948
Elly... Elly...

01:44:03.316 --> 01:44:07.673
Elly... Elly... Elly...

01:44:09.357 --> 01:44:10.790
Elly...

01:44:12.036 --> 01:44:13.788
..Elly...

01:44:14.875 --> 01:44:16.629
..Elly...

01:44:17.836 --> 01:44:19.395
..Elly...

01:44:20.716 --> 01:44:22.673
..Elly...

01:44:23.756 --> 01:44:25.315
..Elly...

01:44:26.356 --> 01:44:27.790
..Elly...

01:44:28.837 --> 01:44:30.394
..Elly...

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.272
(Claire) Hello?

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:13.918
Hello?

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.752
Who is this?
