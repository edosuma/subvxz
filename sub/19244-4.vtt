Every time I go out, RJ makes this face
like, "Mommy, aren't I enough?"

Ugh, babies are the worst.
The trick is to not say goodbye to them.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.729
Alondra, you need to put on a crop top,
go to a concert

who doesn't just see them as dinner.

by the way. They are amazing.

Sheila, you have really changed

You used to be kind of bland, no offense.
And kinda uptight, no offense.

Hey, Eric has a science thing
at school tonight. Will you come?

02:32.819 --> 02:35.446
It'll be so much less boring
than going with just Alondra.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.781

02:36.865 --> 02:40.076
Of course I'll come.

I wanted to adopt Eric, but Joel said no.

It's probably my new diet.
I've been eating a lot of protein.

It's an historical look at the undead

-We had no idea Abby was skipping school.

She's never done it before,
or at least she's never been caught.

Not a great sportswoman either.
Is anything unusual happening at home?

08:25.421 --> 08:28.382
-No. All good.
-Unusual? Very usual.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.427
The reason I'm taking this so seriously
is because it's not just about Abby.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.639
She's also having a corrupting influence
on Eric Bemis.

08:34.722 --> 08:40.853
And... [chuckles] Eric Bemis
is a remarkable young man, so--

08:40.937 --> 08:43.981
Are you saying that Abby Hammond
isn't remarkable?

It'd be great if that's not
what you're saying.

Eric Bemis has a 4.5 GPA.
The only Bs he ever got

08:51.197 --> 08:54.367
are the ones he raised to study
colony collapse disorder. [chuckles]

08:56.494 --> 08:58.162
That's something that happens to bees.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.375
Based on her biology grades, I guess Abby
may not have known that either.

09:02.458 --> 09:06.879
Well, now it feels like you're calling
our daughter stupid. And us.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.881
Again, I'm sure that's not
what he's saying.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.133
It'd be great
if that's not what you're saying.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.427
Yes, it would be. Let's keep this simple.

If your daughter misses school again,
she's going to be suspended.

09:17.390 --> 09:21.978
Suspended? If Abby is going through
some typical teenage problem

09:22.061 --> 09:26.148
that happens to any typical family
like ours,

09:26.232 --> 09:29.902
instead of punishing her
you should show her some compassion.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.863
And you shouldn't tell me
how to do my job.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.367
Well, maybe if you did it right,

09:36.450 --> 09:38.244

wouldn't talk about you

09:52.633 --> 09:55.595
Okay, we'll speak to our daughter and
make sure she never misses school again.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.054
Good. Because if she does...

09:57.138 --> 09:58.681
-Please don't say it.
-...miss school again...

09:58.764 --> 09:59.849

-Don't say it.
-I wouldn't say it.

-...suspended.
-Okay.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.397

walked into a bloodbath,

to his previous one.

the more likely we'll get caught.

10:54.362 --> 10:58.449
And if we get caught,
our lives together will be over, forever.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.575
Do you understand?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.035
Yes. I understand.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.120
I can't be impulsive
and kill the wrong person,

11:03.204 --> 11:06.666
like that bastard in there
who didn't have any family pictures

11:06.749 --> 11:08.626
and probably doesn't have any friends,

11:08.709 --> 11:11.879
but did have sneakers
with reflective strips in his office,

11:11.962 --> 11:13.547
so may run alone at night.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.384
Thank you for hearing me.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.348
So we just got called
into the principal's office.

11:22.431 --> 11:23.766
Why? What'd you do?

11:23.849 --> 11:25.810
[laughs]

11:25.893 --> 11:27.686
What? That was funny!

11:27.770 --> 11:30.398
-She's a remarkable girl.
-I know she's remarkable.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.816
-So then we're done?
-[Joel] No.

11:31.899 --> 11:35.069
It's because you're remarkable
that we expect more of you.

11:35.861 --> 11:40.116
It all just seems so meaningless.
Seriously, trigonometry?

11:40.616 --> 11:43.577
-What does that matter?
-Trigonometry matters a lot.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.621
There are triangles in everything.

11:45.704 --> 11:50.543
Pizza. Triangles.
Not the shape, the musical instrument.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.754
-Honey, anything you want to add?
-Sure.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.298
If Abby doesn't want to go to school,
she shouldn't go.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.550
-What?
-Wait, you're serious?

11:57.633 --> 11:58.801
As a triangle.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.512
She's not gonna use half the stuff
they teach in there

12:01.595 --> 12:03.764
and you never cared about trigonometry.

12:03.848 --> 12:07.435
The only triangle you were interested in
was the one in my pants.

12:07.518 --> 12:10.062
-Mom! Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.313
Follow your heart.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.775
Listen, you like writing poetry?
Maybe do that.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.361
You're saying I should
drop out of school and be a poet?

12:17.445 --> 12:21.740
-No, no, no. No one's saying that.
-That's exactly what I'm saying.

12:21.824 --> 12:25.077
-Live your best life.
-What's happening right now?

12:27.246 --> 12:29.748
What's happening is you're grounded.
So go to your room.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.625
Thank you. No, that I understand.

12:34.795 --> 12:38.132
-You can't keep being like this.
-You mean, being who I am?

12:38.215 --> 12:40.926
I know you want to do
whatever you want now,

12:41.010 --> 12:43.179
but I'm not sure
the family can survive it.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.274
-Hello?
-[robot whirring]

12:55.357 --> 12:59.069
Mrs. Hammond, what are you doing here?
Would you like a Triscuit?

12:59.153 --> 13:01.489
Your front door was unlocked,
and no, thank you.

13:01.572 --> 13:05.284
Listen, I need to talk to someone, and you
are the closest thing to an expert I know.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.704
Thank you. Please, sit.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.918
This morning, I felt really great.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.795
I was encouraging everyone
to be their best selves,

13:16.879 --> 13:19.882
but just now,
I told Abby to drop out of school.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.344
And before that,
I almost killed Principal Novak.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.972
Yes, uh, impulse control.
The undead do not have it.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.974
I gotta do something,
because I can't be like--

13:29.058 --> 13:30.226
-[growling]
-[yelps]

13:30.309 --> 13:32.728
-Oh, uh... sorry.
-It's okay.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.730
No pee, so, that's a win.

13:34.813 --> 13:38.734
Do you think it's possible for me
to have any control?

13:38.817 --> 13:41.403
We can't ignore a fundamental truth.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.864
The undead are completely driven
by their id.

13:43.948 --> 13:47.284
But if I can't control myself,
then I risk everything that matters to me.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.827
You can't change your nature.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.704
-But I have to.
-Then maybe you can.

13:50.788 --> 13:51.997
-Do you think?
-No.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.458
-But I could lose my family.
-Then you have to change.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.085
-But you just said I can't.
-You can't.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.795
-But you're saying I have to.
-You do.

13:59.421 --> 14:03.425
You're saying that I need to change
my nature, but that's impossible.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.763
Yeah.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.641
Uh, on the other hand,
maybe nothing's impossible.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.353
Who would've ever thought an octopus
and a kitten could fall in love?

14:15.646 --> 14:18.482
It's on YouTube, you gotta see it.
It'll give you hope.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.657
No.

14:27.950 --> 14:28.784
Wait.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.587
Oh, I'm sorry, did you want one?

14:43.340 --> 14:44.300
[chuckles]

14:44.967 --> 14:46.218
You know, I used to ditch.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.682
My home life
was also a little challenging.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.058
Really?

14:53.142 --> 14:56.562
Did Grandma Jenny eat half a man
and bury the rest of him in the desert?

14:56.645 --> 15:00.691
No. But she once made a produce guy cry
over a head of lettuce,

15:00.774 --> 15:02.276
and that was her public persona.

15:04.862 --> 15:05.863
How'd you deal?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.157
[exhales]

15:08.240 --> 15:11.619
Collected baseball cards,
painted pine cones.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.121
Sometimes I went into the woods
and yelled at birds.

15:16.373 --> 15:17.416
You yelled at birds?

15:17.499 --> 15:19.001
We didn't have money for a therapist

15:19.084 --> 15:21.795
and yelling at people
was Grandma Jenny's thing.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.255
Then when I got older...

15:25.257 --> 15:26.508
What?

15:28.093 --> 15:28.928
What?

15:29.011 --> 15:31.221
-[engine revving]
-[Abby] Whoo-hoo!

15:31.305 --> 15:34.391
Whoo!

15:45.819 --> 15:48.155
Whoo! That was sick!

15:48.238 --> 15:51.367
I got a bike when I was 16
and never yelled at a bird again.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.202
I can see why.

15:53.285 --> 15:56.038
-Was yours as cool as Rick's?
-It was pretty sweet.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.165
'83 Triumph Daytona.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.961
-Do you still have it?
-Yeah, I keep it in the storage unit...

16:02.044 --> 16:05.089
-Oh, my God, I want to see it.
-Nah.

16:05.297 --> 16:08.425
Now it's just a pile of rusted crap.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.013
Check out this view.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.268
I used to bring your mom up here
when we were in high school.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.688
Carved our initials in that picnic bench.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.483
Back then it was all just open space.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.652
Man, things change.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.531
Can Mom still love?

16:31.198 --> 16:34.076
-What? Of course she can.
-Are you sure?

16:35.411 --> 16:38.330
-Yes.
-That's a weird smile.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.334
-I'm freaking out, man!
-I'm freaking out too!

16:42.418 --> 16:44.795
-It's so weird!
-So fucking weird!

16:44.878 --> 16:46.588
Last week, she organized our pasta
by cooking times,

16:46.672 --> 16:48.507
and wouldn't let me eat crackers
in the living room.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.551
Tuesday, she strangled a rooster!

16:50.634 --> 16:53.053
Two weeks ago, she was making me
vocab cards for the SATs.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.014
Now she doesn't care
if I go to school anymore.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.891
-I know! What the hell's happening?
-I know!

16:57.975 --> 16:59.143
[sighs]

17:00.269 --> 17:05.357
I mean, like, did Mom die when Mom died?

17:10.404 --> 17:12.364
I wish I had more answers, honey.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.665
I know things may have changed from
when you were here in high school but...

17:23.292 --> 17:24.501
it's still beautiful.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.089
Yeah, it is.

17:31.216 --> 17:34.470
Come on, your mom's waiting for us
at that science fair.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.056
Wait. Where'd you carve your initials?

17:41.351 --> 17:42.352
There it is.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.689
[Abby] Aww. That's sweet.

17:45.773 --> 17:50.903
It's been here over 20 years.
Of course, the artwork around it is new.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.578
[computer voice]<i> Nice to meet you.</i>

18:02.748 --> 18:04.708
One day he'll build a woman
out of soft materials

18:04.792 --> 18:06.460
and never come out of his room.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.378
You haven't touched your margarita.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.426
Wow. That's a lot of tequila.

18:14.510 --> 18:18.639
Mmm. Ever since I discovered this little
trick I have been, like, the best mom.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.350
Plus I'm pregaming for a work thing later.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.143
-Tonight?
-Oh, yeah.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.395
Pharmaceutical rep hours
are super flexible.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.648
That's why so many of us have time
to go on <i>The Bachelor.</i>

18:27.731 --> 18:28.774
Oh.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.276
[groans] No.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.905
Ugh. Look at him, the king of nothing.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.574
-[inaudible chatter]
-"Yes, welcome to my land.

18:37.658 --> 18:43.372
I am great. I am a sex tourist,
traveling the world over.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.041
Paying handsomely for sex."

18:46.667 --> 18:47.960
[fake baritone laugh]

18:48.043 --> 18:50.504
"Oh, I am currently farting."

18:50.587 --> 18:51.880
[chuckling]

18:51.964 --> 18:53.590
[murmurs indistinctly] Whoa.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.218
Hi! [under breath] You dickless bore.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.430
-Eric is quite the star, hmm?
-[Lisa] Yeah.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.058
I don't know where he gets it.
His father was so dumb.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.434
I mean, crush a mouse dumb.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.062
-Oh. My.
-Mm.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.356
-Mrs. Hammond.
-Principal Novak.

19:09.439 --> 19:11.733
I am sorry that things went awry
this morning.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.403
Thank you. Apology accepted.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.156
-I wasn't actually apologizing.
-You just said you were sorry.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.450
I'm sorry about the situation,
which you instigated.

19:21.201 --> 19:24.413
Isn't there a potato clock somewhere
that needs your attention?

19:25.664 --> 19:28.709
You should be grateful
that I didn't suspend Abby.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.460
In fact, I still might.

19:30.544 --> 19:33.505
It all depends on what you say next,
madame.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.633
Fine, I'm sorry.

19:38.343 --> 19:42.598
-You farting sex tourist.
-Oh, snap.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.185
Tell Abby don't bother
coming to school tomorrow.

19:49.897 --> 19:50.898
What a cuntstick.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.900
-Hold this?
-Yeah.

20:08.665 --> 20:11.084
-Sheila!
-[gasps] Joel!

20:11.168 --> 20:14.213
Hi, you're here. Where's Abby?

20:14.296 --> 20:16.965
She needed to swing by her locker.
I need to tell you something.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.220
-Yes?
-I love you.

20:22.679 --> 20:26.016
I have loved you since we carved
our initials in that picnic bench.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.310
I've loved you for the 19 years
we've been married,

20:28.393 --> 20:31.438
and I'll love you for however long
we have together.

20:31.521 --> 20:35.275
So... you be whoever you need to be.

20:36.193 --> 20:39.947
Just because something's changed
doesn't mean it's not still beautiful.

20:40.447 --> 20:41.573
[sighs]

20:51.667 --> 20:53.669
That's exactly what I needed to hear.

20:53.752 --> 20:54.962
[door opens]

20:59.091 --> 20:59.967
Oh, my God.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.015
Hey, Novak.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.229
-Dad?
-Abby, go back.

21:12.312 --> 21:14.106
Let's keep this simple.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.733
Abby's going through
a really hard time right now

21:16.817 --> 21:19.278
so you're not going to suspend her,
because if you do

21:19.361 --> 21:20.821
I will make your life miserable.

21:20.904 --> 21:23.657
I can sell your home,
I can fuck up your Zillow estimate.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.867
I can rezone your neighborhood for horses.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.870
I have a notary that will do
anything for me.

21:28.954 --> 21:33.083
I am a realtor and I can destroy you.

21:33.166 --> 21:36.878
It'll all depend on what you say next.

21:41.049 --> 21:43.260
Tell Abby I'll see her at school tomorrow.

21:46.054 --> 21:47.389
[soft chuckle]

21:47.472 --> 21:50.475
Okay, then. You have a lovely evening.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.065
-Wow, you were intense.
-[hallway door opens]

21:57.149 --> 22:00.235
Well, yeah, you're my baby.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.987
[hallway door slams]

22:02.070 --> 22:03.363
[sighs]

22:03.947 --> 22:07.284
All right,
let's go check out Eric's action.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.913
[softly] Why didn't you kill Novak?
Not that I'm complaining.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.915
[softly] You told me to be
who I needed to be,

22:13.999 --> 22:16.752
and that's someone
who doesn't want to lose her family.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.803
-Come on, honey, we're gonna be late.
-Oh, my God.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.559
[hallway door opens]

22:36.563 --> 22:38.065
-Principal Novak, wait.
-Leave me alone.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.524
-Are you Serbian?
-Leave me alone.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.359
I saw the flag in your window.
It's Serbian.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.736
-I saw it in my research.
-Let go.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.613
-Do you speak Serbian?
-You people are insane.

22:44.696 --> 22:47.032
-Do you speak Serbian?
-No, but my grandmother does.

22:47.115 --> 22:50.202
You better let me go because I live
with her and if I'm not home by 8:00--

22:50.285 --> 22:53.246
I'm a grown man and I can do
whatever I want. Still, I'm leaving.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.248
-[engine starts]
-[tires screeching]

22:57.584 --> 22:59.920
I need to meet your grandmother!

23:01.713 --> 23:04.591
How's it going? All right.

23:15.602 --> 23:19.981
Hey, girl. Remember that work opportunity
I told you about last night?

23:20.065 --> 23:22.818
-I closed the deal.
-Ooh, awesome. Big sale?

23:23.819 --> 23:28.532
Sale? No, no. The opportunity
was to bone an oncologist.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.158
-What?
-Yeah.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.410
We've been flirting for weeks,
and you inspired me.

23:32.494 --> 23:33.745
"Live your best life," right?

23:35.038 --> 23:36.581
-Thank you.
-Well...

23:37.290 --> 23:40.544
The clients are running 15 minutes late,
so no rush.

23:40.627 --> 23:41.711
-[door opens]
-[Alondra groans]

23:41.795 --> 23:43.296
It's just three weekends in February.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.258
You can't just pick up
and follow John Legend on tour.

23:46.341 --> 23:47.759
[Alondra] But this could be
my last chance.

23:47.843 --> 23:51.179
Now that he and Chrissy have the baby,
John wants to be home with his family.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.848
He's such a good dad.

23:52.931 --> 23:56.309
You don't do something like this
without us talking about it.

23:56.393 --> 23:59.271
-Hey, good news, Rick.
-Oh, shit.

23:59.354 --> 24:02.274
