WEBVTT

00:02.425 --> 00:04.394
(Briggs)
Previously on "Graceland."

00:04.394 --> 00:06.396
These birds,
they mean something.

00:06.396 --> 00:09.666
And I was sent back here
to figure out what.

00:09.666 --> 00:12.235
This thing is bigger than
I could have ever imagine.

00:12.268 --> 00:14.204
It's a Soviet CW unit.

00:14.237 --> 00:16.406
- It's sarin.
- Your kid is rolling around

00:16.406 --> 00:18.241
with a WMD in his trunk.

00:20.310 --> 00:21.411
Come on.
We want to talk to you.

00:21.444 --> 00:23.113
- Yeah. Sure.
- We need you to stop using.

00:23.146 --> 00:25.415
I know the beginning of this,
I know the middle,
and I do know the end.

00:25.448 --> 00:27.117
We can quit.

00:27.150 --> 00:29.419
This is the last one,
like a a farewell party.

00:29.452 --> 00:32.522
Exactly.
It's like a bon voyage.

00:32.555 --> 00:34.257
No, I'm not a cop.
[spits]

00:34.257 --> 00:35.358
- Stupid bitch!
- Aah!

00:35.392 --> 00:36.393
I want Germaine.

00:36.393 --> 00:38.094
I can make
an introduction for you.

00:38.128 --> 00:40.497
(Amber)
It's a frog.
It symbolizes safe travels.

00:40.530 --> 00:42.165
I have to send
you back, Amber.

00:42.198 --> 00:44.701
God damn Rodney dosed her.
She's pregnant.

00:44.701 --> 00:46.503
We got to clean this up now.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.243
- [choking]
- Oh, my God.

00:53.276 --> 00:55.445
- They got--
- When something's inside you,

00:55.445 --> 00:59.382
like, alive,
you know when it's gone.

00:59.416 --> 01:00.717
Let's go!

01:00.750 --> 01:03.286
We're about to take down
the Armenian frickin' Mafia.

01:03.319 --> 01:06.189
You know,
it's not a big deal.

01:06.222 --> 01:07.157
Wha--

01:07.157 --> 01:09.225
Oh, bro,
we're getting played.

01:09.259 --> 01:10.360
All of it for nothing.

01:10.393 --> 01:12.862
These sons of bitches
are gonna walk.

01:14.864 --> 01:16.199
Get in.

01:24.207 --> 01:27.510
Yes, it's just as he says.

01:27.510 --> 01:31.281
The police bust in,
and then an hour later,

01:31.314 --> 01:33.717
all of them are walking free.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.486
The Mexican even wiped
his tattoos off.

01:36.486 --> 01:39.856
Look, Tevan, he could've sold us
out to the FBI,

01:39.889 --> 01:41.591
and we'd all be in jail now.

01:41.624 --> 01:44.427
He could have screwed us.

01:44.461 --> 01:47.163
Instead he came to me
and told me everything.

01:47.197 --> 01:49.432
He's a good soldier for us.

01:49.466 --> 01:52.168
Yes.
[speaking Armenian]

01:52.202 --> 01:54.871
What does Tevan say--
kill him?

01:55.105 --> 01:57.173
He say...

02:00.343 --> 02:01.745
[exhales sharply]

02:01.778 --> 02:04.447
Let him live.

02:06.149 --> 02:08.251
This is a mistake.

02:08.251 --> 02:10.220
And you know it.

02:10.253 --> 02:13.256
I don't know.
Mistake...

02:13.256 --> 02:17.627
Now we have an informant
inside the FBI.

02:17.627 --> 02:21.698
Now we can feed them whatever
line of bullshit we want.

02:21.731 --> 02:24.100
Why are we risking dealing
with the FBI?

02:24.100 --> 02:26.369
We should be avoiding them,
not feeding them.

02:26.369 --> 02:28.304
You know what
your problem is, Toros?

02:28.338 --> 02:30.473
You don't know
who your friends are.

02:30.507 --> 02:32.308
[speaking Armenian]

02:32.342 --> 02:34.110
Yeah, maybe I should have
sold your bitch-ass out

02:34.110 --> 02:35.645
when I had the chance,
but I didn't.

02:35.645 --> 02:37.380
Did I?
And here we are.

02:37.380 --> 02:39.783
Look, the Feds--
they trust me now.

02:39.783 --> 02:40.784
I'm in.

02:40.784 --> 02:42.452
And what do they know
about us?

02:42.485 --> 02:44.554
There's been
a joint task force

02:44.587 --> 02:47.090
that's been targeting
the Sarkissian family

02:47.123 --> 02:48.658
for, I guess, the last year,
year and a half.

02:48.691 --> 02:49.859
Now, I don't know
what they know, but--

02:50.093 --> 02:51.795
They know a shitload
more than they should.

02:51.828 --> 02:53.363
I got the impression,

02:53.396 --> 02:57.200
the very strong impression
that they have to have a mole--

02:57.233 --> 02:59.736
someone inside
your organization.

02:59.769 --> 03:02.572
And it's someone close.

03:03.807 --> 03:05.475
I'm looking at the mole.

03:05.508 --> 03:06.609
You know what Toros?

03:06.643 --> 03:08.278
You can believe
whatever you want to believe.

03:08.278 --> 03:11.281
But you're never gonna know
until you ask.

03:11.281 --> 03:12.816
Ask who?

03:12.816 --> 03:15.552
- Who do we ask?
- I don't know.

03:15.552 --> 03:18.121
Grab a federal agent,
tie his ass to a chair,

03:18.154 --> 03:20.657
and make him tell you
who the mole is.

03:34.204 --> 03:37.173
[knock at door]

03:37.207 --> 03:39.375
Hey, Amber...

03:39.409 --> 03:41.578
Jakes knows about
what happened in the Glades,

03:41.578 --> 03:43.713
but, um, he doesn't know
about, um, you know--

03:43.713 --> 03:45.782
No, I won't say anything.

03:45.815 --> 03:47.183
- Okay.
- Yeah.

03:47.217 --> 03:50.587
- Thanks.
[knock at door]

03:50.620 --> 03:51.721
Hey.

03:51.754 --> 03:55.291
Who's ready to bust
some shitheads?

03:55.291 --> 03:57.260
Welcome.

04:02.832 --> 04:05.535
You were under
with MOH in Crenshaw.

04:05.568 --> 04:08.738
Mm-hmm. And you've been reading
my case histories.

04:08.771 --> 04:10.607
An hour before
the leader's arrest,

04:10.607 --> 04:14.744
he asked you to be best man
at his wedding.

04:14.744 --> 04:18.314
You know, he did.
I actually still have the rings.

04:18.348 --> 04:20.483
You're an exceptional
agent, Briggs.

04:20.516 --> 04:22.485
(Briggs)
Ah.

04:22.485 --> 04:25.488
So why is the Sarkissian case
such a goddamn debacle?

04:25.521 --> 04:27.190
Well, probably because
it's being undermined

04:27.190 --> 04:29.459
from within, sir.

04:29.459 --> 04:30.660
By who?

04:30.693 --> 04:32.195
Well, that would be me.

04:32.195 --> 04:34.697
Yeah. You know, Toros
was talking about killing me.

04:34.731 --> 04:36.699
I thought about it, and I didn't
think that was a very good idea.

04:36.733 --> 04:39.602
So I blew up the op,
and I sold myself as a CI.

04:39.636 --> 04:41.337
[scoffs]
Jesus Christ.

04:41.371 --> 04:42.605
It kept me alive.

04:42.639 --> 04:46.476
It also managed to keep
your precious crusade alive.

04:46.476 --> 04:49.479
You're welcome.

04:49.512 --> 04:51.381
You want to reprimand me,
don't you?

04:51.381 --> 04:52.749
Go ahead. Give it to me--
both barrels.

04:52.782 --> 04:54.117
Get it all out
of your system,

04:54.117 --> 04:55.885
and then maybe we can talk
about what I need

04:56.119 --> 04:58.221
in order to actually make
this thing work.

04:58.254 --> 05:00.256
Look, the Sarkissians--
they have questions, okay?

05:00.256 --> 05:02.358
About the FBI's
investigation.

05:02.392 --> 05:04.360
I don't have any answers.

05:04.394 --> 05:05.361
You're the CI.

05:05.395 --> 05:07.363
A CI is not an agent.

05:07.363 --> 05:09.198
I need somebody
who can talk to Ari,

05:09.232 --> 05:10.500
somebody who can talk
to Toros.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.336
Tell them, you know, something
that they'll believe.

05:13.369 --> 05:15.638
Well, that sounds like
a very unpleasant experience.

05:15.638 --> 05:17.507
They're very unpleasant guys.

05:17.507 --> 05:19.242
The good news, though,
is that I will be there.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.878
I can manage it, control it,
and this is the FBI.

05:22.111 --> 05:24.647
I am sure that right out there
there is some agent

05:24.681 --> 05:28.618
who can deal
with a little unpleasantness.

05:28.651 --> 05:31.754
Give me a reason
to trust you.

05:31.788 --> 05:33.323
I'm an exceptional agent.

05:36.559 --> 05:40.263
[cell phone ringing]

05:40.263 --> 05:43.266
[groans]

05:52.408 --> 05:53.810
Yeah.

05:53.843 --> 05:56.279
(on phone)
This is Logan.
I need to talk to you.

05:56.279 --> 05:58.548
Uh, yes, sir.

05:58.548 --> 06:00.149
Uh, what about?

06:00.183 --> 06:03.619
We need to speak
in person.

06:03.653 --> 06:04.821
- You there?
- Okay.

06:04.854 --> 06:06.622
I'll be in to the field office
later today.

06:06.656 --> 06:08.224
Please do that.

06:08.257 --> 06:11.260
And, Warren, let's keep this
between ourselves.

06:11.260 --> 06:13.496
Of course, sir.

06:31.414 --> 06:33.683
(Gusti)
What are you looking for?

06:37.587 --> 06:39.589
What, this?

06:39.589 --> 06:41.657
[chuckles]
Come on.

06:41.691 --> 06:43.626
Hey, hey, no.

06:45.561 --> 06:48.097
Hey, you know why people
in Bali don't use drugs?

06:48.131 --> 06:50.700
Because Indonesia
has the death penalty.

06:50.700 --> 06:54.337
Because it's very hard to find
balance when you're addicted.

06:54.370 --> 06:57.607
I'm not addicted.

06:57.607 --> 07:01.277
You know, I bust my ass and
my balls each day to earn money.

07:01.310 --> 07:02.678
What do you do?

07:02.712 --> 07:04.814
You get high with Madison
and maybe take a beauty nap.

07:04.847 --> 07:06.883
Jesus Christ.

07:06.883 --> 07:09.152
You're fired, man.

07:09.185 --> 07:11.320
- Whoa, whoa, Vin--
- No, no, no, no, no.

07:11.354 --> 07:13.756
I give you a cut of the teeth
money because I'm a nice guy.

07:13.756 --> 07:15.425
- I helped you out--
- No, no, no.

07:15.458 --> 07:18.461
Maybe I'll give a cut of the
thing-in-the-trunk money too.

07:18.461 --> 07:22.331
But only for ass-kicker,
not if you suck.

07:22.331 --> 07:25.201
I don't--
I don't suck, man.

07:25.201 --> 07:27.870
I kick ass, all right?
I kick ass for you.

07:30.740 --> 07:33.209
You know,
I know this couple.

07:33.209 --> 07:36.779
They rob maybe electronics
and sell cheap.

07:36.779 --> 07:38.748
They want me to come today
and check some stuff out--

07:38.781 --> 07:40.116
you know, big discount.

07:40.116 --> 07:42.351
- Yeah, yeah.
- But they use meth.

07:42.385 --> 07:45.521
You know, so, when they
smoke it, they're very happy.

07:45.521 --> 07:46.889
Business is good.

07:47.123 --> 07:50.359
But when they're out, you know,
they have bad attitude.

07:50.359 --> 07:52.361
So maybe I won't go.

07:52.361 --> 07:54.230
You see, the problem
with druggies

07:54.263 --> 07:56.099
is that they're druggies.

07:56.099 --> 07:57.233
- They're unreliable.
- No.

07:57.233 --> 07:58.434
Stop! Stop, man!

07:58.468 --> 07:59.435
- No!
- Come on, man.

07:59.469 --> 08:00.603
- Hey!
- Jesus Christ!

08:00.636 --> 08:02.505
You are a good kid.
You have bright future.

08:02.505 --> 08:05.241
But the water--
it's a wake-up call, man.

08:05.274 --> 08:07.777
And no one is needing
more unreliable druggies.

08:07.777 --> 08:09.745
I need an ass-kicker.

08:09.779 --> 08:11.214
So you tell me know.
Are you good?

08:11.247 --> 08:12.248
- I'm good, man.
- Are you good?

08:12.248 --> 08:14.283
I'm good!
I'm good.

08:18.287 --> 08:20.556
All right, man,
you're un-fired.

08:20.556 --> 08:22.725
Come on,
let's go see them.

08:26.529 --> 08:29.398
We knocked off a repair shop
in Westwood.

08:29.398 --> 08:32.535
They're refurbs, but at least
they work, right?

08:32.535 --> 08:34.804
Hey, hey,
looking sweet, man.

08:34.804 --> 08:36.339
$100 each?

08:36.372 --> 08:37.807
Vinny said you used
to do movies.

08:37.807 --> 08:39.142
Anything I've seen?

08:39.175 --> 08:40.543
You ever seen Scorpion King 2?

08:40.543 --> 08:43.346
I think I missed that--

08:43.379 --> 08:45.148
- What you got over here? This.
- Okay, you know what?

08:45.148 --> 08:46.282
You don't even have to worry
about that.

08:46.282 --> 08:47.617
That's just--

08:47.650 --> 08:48.684
Whoa, Mike.

08:48.718 --> 08:50.153
Sorry.

08:50.186 --> 08:51.821
Hey, man, maybe
you don't know computers,

08:51.854 --> 08:53.789
but you can't throw them
on the ground, my friend.

08:53.823 --> 08:55.124
No, no, no.
I'm sure they're fine.

08:55.158 --> 08:56.792
Those things have,
uh, good packaging.

08:56.826 --> 08:59.829
Yeah. Yeah.

08:59.829 --> 09:01.130
(Sascha)
Hey, wait a sec--

09:01.164 --> 09:02.832
- Vin. Look.
- Huh?

09:05.301 --> 09:06.536
Whoa, this is bullshit, man!
Give me my money back!

09:06.569 --> 09:08.437
Whoa, wait, Vin,
we're in a spot.

09:08.437 --> 09:09.772
- Give me my money--
- No. We won't!

09:09.805 --> 09:10.806
- Whoa! Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.408
- Get back. Get back.
- Hey, Lara.

09:12.441 --> 09:13.809
- You too, stuntman.
- Just--

09:13.843 --> 09:14.844
Empty your pockets.

09:14.844 --> 09:16.279
- Are you crazy?
- All right. All right.

09:16.312 --> 09:17.280
Hey! Hey!

09:17.313 --> 09:18.381
- This is not my business.
- Hey!

09:18.414 --> 09:19.715
- Right now!
- Just give it to her, okay?

09:19.749 --> 09:21.384
- Empty!
- Hey, here you go. Look.

09:21.417 --> 09:22.685
All right?
This is for you.

09:22.718 --> 09:23.853
- Okay. Okay.
- Let's go.

09:23.853 --> 09:25.454
- Here you go--
- Get all that, Sascha.

09:25.488 --> 09:28.291
- Hurry up!
- Okay. Look, that's for you.

09:28.291 --> 09:29.425
- Get all that.
- Yeah.

09:29.425 --> 09:30.493
- That's for you.
- Get it!

09:30.526 --> 09:31.561
- Uh-huh.
- All right. You got the money.

09:31.561 --> 09:33.095
Just that
and get out of here, okay?

09:33.129 --> 09:35.164
We want the box.

09:35.164 --> 09:36.832
We want the box.

09:36.832 --> 09:39.302
- The box is ours.
- Get back!

10:20.710 --> 10:22.878
I don't like babysitting

What I mean is she ran.
She took off.

I slept with him,
then stole his wallet.

Hmm, well, then Germaine might
find it awfully discourteous

without a hand.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.507
He said Odin cut it off

13:38.507 --> 13:40.509
'cause he showed up
half hour late to a meet.

13:40.509 --> 13:43.212
Nope, because
he came 15 minutes late.

13:43.245 --> 13:44.380

13:44.413 --> 13:46.315
All right? That thing is
very important to Odin.

13:46.348 --> 13:49.118
So none of us need
to get our hands cut off.

13:49.151 --> 13:50.786
Just--just give it back to us,

13:50.820 --> 13:52.488

this whole thing.

he is feeling manipulated.

- He's doesn't want the crate.

I hold that crate,

and he didn't ask for cash.

19:23.619 --> 19:24.686
I'll blow his brains out.

19:24.686 --> 19:26.789
- I swear to God.
- Enjoy.

19:26.822 --> 19:28.357
- Where are the two L-bows at?
- I'll kill him.

19:28.390 --> 19:29.525
Where are they?

19:29.525 --> 19:31.126
Yo, you might want to drop
your gun.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.461
Get back!

19:35.230 --> 19:37.432
(Tuturro)
Now, why you want to go
and do that, huh?

19:47.643 --> 19:49.511
(Paige, distorted voice)
Put your gun down.

19:53.448 --> 19:56.151
- Ah!
- Hey, okay.

19:56.151 --> 19:57.553
Look at me.
Look at me.

19:57.586 --> 19:58.887
You're gonna be okay,
all right?

19:59.121 --> 20:01.890
I want you to breathe, okay?
Okay, you're okay.

20:02.090 --> 20:05.761
- [grunting]
- Nice and easy. There you go.

20:25.347 --> 20:27.182
If the pain gets
to be too much,

20:27.182 --> 20:30.586
give him one of these
every 12 hours.

20:30.586 --> 20:33.322
- How's your head doing?
- I'm good.

20:33.322 --> 20:35.424
All right, man.

20:40.729 --> 20:42.698
You see?
This is why.

20:42.698 --> 20:46.435
You say you're good with guns,
you know them.

20:46.435 --> 20:50.439
When you get on drugs,
you're no good with anything.

20:51.740 --> 20:55.277
You shoot your friends.

20:55.310 --> 20:57.679
It was
a messed-up situation.

20:57.713 --> 20:59.314
But, uh...

21:02.217 --> 21:05.487
I saved the crate.

21:05.487 --> 21:07.489
He gave you the crate back?

21:07.522 --> 21:09.224
- Yeah.
- Why?

21:12.194 --> 21:14.463
He owed me.

21:14.496 --> 21:17.199
Something is happening, man.
I don't understand.

21:19.468 --> 21:21.403
You're a stuntman.

21:21.436 --> 21:24.673
And this Odin Rossi guy,
he owes you favors?

21:24.706 --> 21:26.742
- Hey. Hey.
- No, I don't understand.

21:26.742 --> 21:28.443
- It's okay, man.
- No.

21:28.477 --> 21:31.780
I thought I knew
what I was doing here.

21:31.780 --> 21:34.216
But nothing's
what it seems.

21:34.249 --> 21:37.152
No one's
who they say they are.

21:38.654 --> 21:41.256
You want the crate?
You want the phone?

21:41.290 --> 21:42.491
- You take it.
- No, no, that's--

21:42.524 --> 21:44.226
- No.
- It's yours, man.

21:44.226 --> 21:46.495
I'm going home.

21:46.495 --> 21:48.330
I want to be
with my family.

21:48.363 --> 21:50.565
Vin, no, no, no.
Come on, man.

21:50.599 --> 21:51.767
Vin, look at me.

21:51.767 --> 21:53.368
That guy who gave you
this phone--

21:53.368 --> 21:55.237
he has your picture, okay?

21:55.270 --> 21:57.572
He doesn't know me.
He's not gonna buy it from me.

21:57.606 --> 22:00.108
Someone will buy...

22:00.142 --> 22:03.445
yeah, whatever it is.

22:03.478 --> 22:06.481
Someone always buys
in this country.

22:31.406 --> 22:34.376
[exhales deeply, sniffs]

22:58.300 --> 23:01.236
[sniffs]

23:11.546 --> 23:14.649
(man on phone)
Riverside Rehab.
How may I help you?

23:16.618 --> 23:19.654
[scoffs, chuckles]

23:48.250 --> 23:51.219
[door opens]

23:51.219 --> 23:53.288
Hey, did you find him yet?

23:53.321 --> 23:55.190
No, no, no, no.
It's T.

23:55.190 --> 23:56.658
Not D.
Tango.

23:56.691 --> 24:00.695
TLX119.

24:00.729 --> 24:03.265
Yeah. No, we need to establish
patterns, you know,

24:03.298 --> 24:04.866
where he goes, how he moves,

24:05.100 --> 24:08.336
evasive maneuvers--
things like that.

24:08.336 --> 24:11.540
All right.
Speak soon.

24:11.573 --> 24:13.275
TLX--
is that a plate?

24:13.308 --> 24:15.410
Who you tailing?

24:15.444 --> 24:17.779
One of the Sarkissians.
You all right?

24:17.779 --> 24:21.183
[sighs]
No, I'm not.

24:21.216 --> 24:24.786
I haven't had a fix
since last night.

24:24.820 --> 24:27.589
I need your help.

24:27.622 --> 24:31.493
The first time
I went through detox,

24:31.493 --> 24:33.495
I was in a hostel
in Venice Beach.

24:33.528 --> 24:35.697
- Is that okay?
- Mm-hmm.

24:35.730 --> 24:37.332
Yeah, I was using again
in a week.

24:37.365 --> 24:40.735
Second time, I went out
to Catalina Island.

24:40.769 --> 24:44.439
Suffice it to say,
that didn't turn out too well.

24:44.473 --> 24:46.641
And the third time,
I was in the basement

24:46.675 --> 24:49.111
of a Buddhist monastery,
13,000 feet up

24:49.111 --> 24:50.846
in the Spiti Valley.

24:50.879 --> 24:53.215
Is that the one that stuck?

24:53.248 --> 24:55.851
Well, you know, the occasional
relapse not withstanding.

24:55.884 --> 24:57.586
It's the one I did
for myself.

24:57.619 --> 24:59.254
And that's where
you're starting out.

24:59.287 --> 25:01.256
- Mm-hmm.
- That's a good thing, man.

25:01.289 --> 25:03.658
This may feel like overkill,
but 72 hours in,

25:03.658 --> 25:06.528
you will do anything,
say anything, to get a fix.

25:06.561 --> 25:08.096
This is gonna be
the hardest thing

25:08.130 --> 25:11.099
you have ever done
in your life, Mike.

25:11.133 --> 25:13.401
I got it.

25:13.401 --> 25:15.670
Thanks, Paul.

25:15.670 --> 25:16.872
Yeah.

25:26.148 --> 25:28.416
Come on!
Somebody--

25:28.416 --> 25:29.551
Somebody--

25:29.551 --> 25:32.154
[retching]

25:32.154 --> 25:34.556
[groaning]

25:34.556 --> 25:35.790
Somebody--

25:38.293 --> 25:40.295
Dude, just let me out, man.
Just let me out for a minute.

25:40.328 --> 25:41.696
I can't man.
Look, then you'll run. Look--

25:41.696 --> 25:43.165
- I'm not gonna--
- You got this, man.

25:43.165 --> 25:44.299
- You tough, right?

25:44.299 --> 25:46.134
I got to take a piss, man.
Just get me up.

25:46.168 --> 25:47.702
All right, guys,
I was just kidding, all right?

25:47.702 --> 25:49.671
- You can get me up.
- How about I--

25:49.704 --> 25:50.805
I'll tell you a story.

25:50.839 --> 25:52.541
Okay, it's about the time
that me and brother,

25:52.574 --> 25:53.808
we went to Six Flags.

25:53.842 --> 25:57.245
"He could not help
but notice

25:57.279 --> 26:01.116
the certain peculiarity
of expression, like..."

26:01.149 --> 26:02.817
[distorted voice]
"He could not help but notice

26:02.851 --> 26:04.819
the certain peculiarity
of expression, like..."

26:04.853 --> 26:06.588
Paige, something's wrong.
Something's wrong. I--

26:06.588 --> 26:08.190
[normal voice]
Mike, You're okay.

26:08.190 --> 26:10.258
- No, I don't know what it is.
- You're okay. Just listen.

26:10.292 --> 26:11.526
[distorted voice]
"Like restrained glow--"

26:11.560 --> 26:13.161
"They had two teeth
on the starter

26:13.195 --> 26:14.796
"so it could turn the flywheel.

26:14.829 --> 26:18.166
[distorted voice]
"Now, the gap between the
flywheel and the magneto

26:18.166 --> 26:19.568
should be no wider--"
Hey, easy. Easy.

26:19.568 --> 26:21.169
- Please stop with that.
- "Than a playing card--"

26:21.203 --> 26:22.571
[normal voice]
Mike, I'm just doing this

26:22.604 --> 26:23.872
to try to help you out, man.

26:23.872 --> 26:25.574
- I don't want to hear about--
- And the electric--

26:25.607 --> 26:26.875
Shut up!

26:26.875 --> 26:29.811
[distorted voice]
"The electric"--

26:29.844 --> 26:32.747
So it's weird with a CI, 'cause
you start to get to trust them,

26:32.747 --> 26:34.549
and then you realize they're
only looking out for themselves.

26:34.583 --> 26:36.618
[laughing]

26:36.618 --> 26:38.186
Let me out!

26:38.220 --> 26:39.854
[distorted voice]
Check it out.
Me and my brother

26:39.888 --> 26:41.223
went to Six Flags
one time, right?

26:41.223 --> 26:42.324
I just need, like,
a pill or something.

26:42.357 --> 26:43.858
Hey, Mike,
you listening, man?

26:43.858 --> 26:46.461
And we got stuck upside down
on the Viper.

26:46.461 --> 26:47.696
Can you hear me?

26:47.729 --> 26:49.197
It's scary 'cause
you're going fast,

26:49.231 --> 26:50.699
and you don't want to get
stuck up there.

26:50.732 --> 26:52.200
It's okay.
This isn't you.

26:52.234 --> 26:53.702
Don't touch me.

26:53.735 --> 26:57.572
[sobbing]
I just want to feel better, man.

26:57.606 --> 26:59.207
Easy, Mike.

26:59.207 --> 27:01.476
We are all here for you.

27:01.476 --> 27:03.511
You just please got to let me
out of here, man.

27:03.545 --> 27:04.746
[laughs]

27:04.779 --> 27:06.381
You don't understand
what this feels like.

27:06.414 --> 27:07.649
I'm not a mess!

27:07.682 --> 27:11.119
It just feels like my whole body
is, like, trying to get out.

27:11.119 --> 27:12.187
You okay, man?

27:12.220 --> 27:13.622
You're not doing so well.

27:13.655 --> 27:14.789
I can't breathe.

27:14.823 --> 27:16.458
Look at me.
Do I look like I'm a mess?

27:16.491 --> 27:18.226
- I'm fine.
- Look at my hand, Mike.

27:18.260 --> 27:19.628
It's like something
is tightening on my chest.

27:19.628 --> 27:21.196
- Just breathe.
- [shouts]

27:21.229 --> 27:23.231
- Hey, it's just me and you.
- It's gonna be okay.

27:23.231 --> 27:26.101
(Mike)
No, no, there's something.

27:26.101 --> 27:28.370
(Tuturro)
Mikey.

27:31.806 --> 27:34.376
Hey, man, you--
Mike, you all right?

27:34.409 --> 27:37.646
You're just gonna sleep
in your own puke?

27:37.646 --> 27:40.582
Yo, Mikey.

27:40.615 --> 27:42.350
Mike!

27:44.119 --> 27:45.787
Hey, I need
some help in here!

27:45.820 --> 27:47.222
- Mikey.
- What's up? What's up?

27:47.255 --> 27:48.356
Mike! He's too hot.
He's burning up.

27:48.390 --> 27:49.491
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.

27:49.524 --> 27:50.759
- Charlie, start the tub.
- He's hot, man.

27:50.792 --> 27:53.194
- He's way too hot.
- He's running a fever.

27:55.497 --> 27:57.132
- I can feel him through his--
- Stay with us, buddy.

27:57.132 --> 27:58.667
- Stay with us. Stay with us.
- Get him up, get him up.

27:58.667 --> 28:01.136
Come on!

28:01.136 --> 28:02.737
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

28:02.771 --> 28:04.639
- Come on.
- Come on.

28:04.673 --> 28:06.808
(Paige)
Is it ready?

28:06.808 --> 28:07.809
- Okay.
- Easy. Easy.

28:07.809 --> 28:09.277
(Paige)
I got his head. I got his head.

28:09.277 --> 28:11.513
- Easy, easy, easy.
- All right, guys, watch out.

28:11.546 --> 28:14.416
Watch out, watch out,
watch out.

28:14.416 --> 28:16.151
Mike, I'm gonna dunk you
in the water, okay, buddy?

28:16.184 --> 28:17.686
One, two, three...

28:19.821 --> 28:22.123
[muffled voices]

28:22.157 --> 28:23.658
- Get him up, man.
- We got to bring

28:23.658 --> 28:26.561
his body temperature down, guys.
Come on.

28:35.136 --> 28:36.171
- Get him up!
- Get him up!

28:36.171 --> 28:37.439
He's still burning up.

28:37.439 --> 28:39.174
One, two, three, down.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.276
- Mike.
- Mike.

29:15.310 --> 29:17.278
- There we go. There we go.
- He's coming back.

29:17.312 --> 29:18.446
Okay, Mike, one more time.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.348
Big breath.

29:33.728 --> 29:35.864
- You guys arguing?
- Hey, come on.

29:36.097 --> 29:37.332
(Tuturro)
Bring him up!

29:37.365 --> 29:39.134
(Briggs)
We got to bring his body
temperature down, guys.

29:39.167 --> 29:40.535
Come on.

29:40.568 --> 29:41.870
- Go, pick him up.
- [gasps]

29:41.870 --> 29:43.438
- Mike.
- He's back.

29:43.471 --> 29:45.840
You okay?

29:45.874 --> 29:47.475
You all right?

29:47.475 --> 29:50.578
- Okay?
- You good, man?

29:50.612 --> 29:52.347
- Is he okay?
- Oh, shit.

29:52.380 --> 29:54.849
[relieved laughter]

29:54.883 --> 29:57.252
You guys are the ugliest angels
I've ever seen.

29:57.285 --> 29:58.753
[laughs]

29:58.787 --> 30:00.221
Jesus Christ.

30:00.255 --> 30:04.125
- Back from the dead twice.
- Jesus Christ.

30:22.777 --> 30:25.246
Cool.
Badass, Charlie.

30:25.246 --> 30:27.182
- Walk me through this, Dale.
- Okay, it's simple.

30:27.215 --> 30:30.185
Germaine shows.
He asks to see the cash.

30:30.218 --> 30:33.154
I show him the cash.
He gives me a quote.

30:33.188 --> 30:35.824
And then I say,
"That seems reasonable."

30:35.824 --> 30:37.125
Go time.

30:37.125 --> 30:39.494
All right, then we'll be
right on top of you.

30:52.807 --> 30:55.276
He's here.

30:55.276 --> 30:56.811
So we own the floor.

30:56.845 --> 30:58.213
If he tries to bolt,

30:58.246 --> 31:00.148
don't be afraid to kick his ass
through a door.

31:00.148 --> 31:01.216
Copy that.

31:01.249 --> 31:02.283
How do I look?

31:02.283 --> 31:04.118
Like $1.1 million.

31:05.687 --> 31:07.689
Show me the hallway.

31:10.525 --> 31:13.294
(Jakes)
Welcome, man,
I'm glad you could make it.

31:13.328 --> 31:15.430
- Here we go.
- What have you got for me?

31:15.430 --> 31:16.631
Oh, we got
a surprise for you,

31:16.664 --> 31:19.567
you dirtbag, cockney,
torturing little bitch.

31:19.601 --> 31:22.837
I think I got something
you're gonna like.

31:22.837 --> 31:25.139
Make yourself at home, guys.

31:25.173 --> 31:27.509
[grunts]

31:27.542 --> 31:29.244
[clears throat]

31:29.277 --> 31:31.145
Bad bitch, isn't it?

31:31.179 --> 31:34.182
- Everybody, get ready to move.
- $1 million.

31:34.215 --> 31:37.185
Hey. Yo, I thought you said
we own the floor.

31:37.218 --> 31:39.387
We do.

31:40.455 --> 31:42.690
Who the hell is that?

31:42.690 --> 31:44.792
- She's going in there.
- She better not.

31:47.562 --> 31:49.731
(Amber)
She's coming this way.

31:58.873 --> 32:01.209
Can I help you?

32:01.209 --> 32:03.278
Which one of you is
Agent DeMarco?

32:03.311 --> 32:04.712
I am.
Do I know you?

32:04.746 --> 32:07.248
You sure as hell should.

32:09.651 --> 32:12.153
Windgate said
you take 30%, yeah?

32:12.186 --> 32:13.488
35%.

32:13.488 --> 32:14.489
35%.

32:14.489 --> 32:16.190
Windgates were small fry.

32:16.190 --> 32:17.659
You're bringing
more money for me.

32:17.692 --> 32:20.528
That's more work.

32:20.562 --> 32:22.397
35%. Okay.

32:22.430 --> 32:23.865
That sounds reasonable.

32:23.865 --> 32:26.234
It is.

32:30.572 --> 32:33.541
So you're from London, huh?
Yeah, I've been there.

32:33.575 --> 32:35.443
The thing about the bad food
and the bad teeth--

32:35.476 --> 32:36.844
it's not true.

32:39.514 --> 32:41.316
I'm from Chicago, myself--
Lawndale.

32:41.349 --> 32:42.617
It's funny--
where I come from,

32:42.650 --> 32:44.352
brothers rarely see
that type of green.

32:44.385 --> 32:46.854
It's not reasonable, you know?

32:48.756 --> 32:50.458
You've done well
for yourself then.

32:50.491 --> 32:51.459
Thank you.

32:51.492 --> 32:52.727
(woman)
This floor belongs to you?

32:52.760 --> 32:54.362
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

32:54.395 --> 32:55.496
- Why not?
- Listen, girl,

32:55.530 --> 32:56.631
stay out of my business.

32:56.664 --> 32:59.367
Get out of my face
before I strangle you.

32:59.367 --> 33:02.337
These freakin' neighbors,
I swear to God--all night.

33:02.370 --> 33:04.305
[chuckles]
I got no sleep, man.

33:04.339 --> 33:06.474
You see these bags?
What are y'all doing right now?

33:06.507 --> 33:08.843
You guys, um--you guys
want to stay for a drink?

33:08.876 --> 33:11.379
I'd actually love to hear
about your business.

33:11.379 --> 33:13.381
Do you chat up the girl
that washes your knickers?

33:13.381 --> 33:14.716
Excuse me?

33:14.749 --> 33:17.452
As long as your trousers show up
nice and clean on a hanger,

33:17.485 --> 33:20.688
what do you give a toss
what they did back there?

33:20.688 --> 33:22.824
How about a drink
between friends, then?

33:22.824 --> 33:26.160
This is a business transaction,
not a social event.

33:28.563 --> 33:32.133
I'm not your friend, friend.

33:32.133 --> 33:34.535
That sounds reasonable.

33:34.535 --> 33:35.737
Entirely reasonable.

33:41.676 --> 33:44.345
Somebody want to tell me
what the hell happened?

33:44.379 --> 33:45.813
He's an informant.

33:45.813 --> 33:47.415
What do you mean
he's an informant?

33:47.415 --> 33:48.816
- He's a CI. He's a criminal--
- Yeah, yeah.

33:48.816 --> 33:51.386
I know what an informant is.
An informant for whom?

33:51.419 --> 33:52.553
ATF.

33:52.553 --> 33:54.756
- Bullshit.
- Not bullshit.

33:54.789 --> 33:56.658
They're tracking
his gun-related clientele,

33:56.658 --> 33:58.793
building dossiers,
following funds.

33:58.793 --> 34:00.828
In the meantime,
ATF is protecting his ass.

34:00.862 --> 34:03.131
Charlie, I'm sorry.

34:03.164 --> 34:05.566
Yeah, I thought the FBI was way
bigger than the ATF.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.169
Germaine's handler,
this bitch, Stanwood--

34:08.202 --> 34:10.171
she called the Director
personally,

34:10.171 --> 34:13.307
got an injunction
from up high.

34:13.341 --> 34:14.442
(Amber)
What do we do now?

34:16.344 --> 34:18.312
What?

34:18.312 --> 34:19.547
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

34:19.580 --> 34:21.716
Who's we?
Are you out of your mind?

34:21.749 --> 34:23.818
We, meaning me and Dale,
we're gonna go home.

34:23.851 --> 34:26.254
You, Amber, you're gonna
go back to federal pen.

34:26.287 --> 34:27.522
You didn't do shit for me.

34:27.555 --> 34:29.290
You said that you were gonna
make a deal with the DA.

34:29.290 --> 34:31.259
Yeah, what--what deal?

34:31.292 --> 34:32.827
That's if you did your job.

34:32.860 --> 34:33.828
- What?
- Look, there's no deal.

34:33.861 --> 34:36.698
- It's over.
- You bitch.

34:36.698 --> 34:38.166
I went into the water for you.

34:38.166 --> 34:39.233
Bitch?

34:39.267 --> 34:40.501
Who you calling a bitch?

34:40.535 --> 34:42.170
- Charlie.
- You did that to save yourself.

34:42.203 --> 34:43.171
- Charlie.
- Everything you do

34:43.204 --> 34:44.305
- is self-serving.
- Charlie.

34:44.338 --> 34:45.673
- Everything.
- I tried to save you!

34:45.707 --> 34:47.141
I tried to save your baby!

34:47.175 --> 34:48.843
You tried to save my baby?

34:48.876 --> 34:50.344
- You're delusional.
- Hey, Charlie.

34:50.378 --> 34:51.479
- I could've ran, Charlie.
- Wack-a-doo!

34:51.479 --> 34:53.548
- Charlie!
- You got a savior complex.

34:53.581 --> 34:54.882
I thought we were
frickin' friends.

34:55.116 --> 34:56.684
- Get her out of my face.
- Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

34:56.718 --> 34:57.719
Here, here.
Hey, hey, hey.

34:57.752 --> 34:59.420
Here.

34:59.454 --> 35:01.489
What baby?

35:01.489 --> 35:04.192
It doesn't matter.

35:04.225 --> 35:06.294
It doesn't matter, Dale.

35:09.097 --> 35:12.133
Let's go arrest
some Windgates.

35:17.472 --> 35:20.408
[humming]

35:35.123 --> 35:38.493
[sighs]

36:18.399 --> 36:20.535
Went for a run?

36:20.535 --> 36:21.869
Been a while.

36:22.103 --> 36:24.272
Yeah, I was gonna say, uh...

36:24.272 --> 36:26.140
you looked like
you were getting a little soft

36:26.174 --> 36:27.809
around the edges there,
like old Daddy Briggs.

36:27.842 --> 36:30.812
Yeah. Yeah.

36:30.812 --> 36:34.282
I wanted to say thank you.

36:34.282 --> 36:36.150
Thank you?

36:36.150 --> 36:37.385
Well...
[clears throat]

36:37.418 --> 36:39.620
That's nice, Mike.

36:39.654 --> 36:44.125
But you did this, brother,
not me.

36:44.125 --> 36:46.427
I did.

36:48.529 --> 36:51.299
Well, what I did was
get myself duct-taped to a pipe

36:51.299 --> 36:52.300
by a couple of meth heads.

36:52.300 --> 36:54.435
That's what I did.

36:54.435 --> 36:55.703
You gonna notify the Bureau?

36:55.736 --> 36:56.838
[chuckles]

36:56.838 --> 36:58.372
Yeah. I'm gonna call them
right now.

36:58.406 --> 36:59.774
[Briggs chuckles]

36:59.807 --> 37:02.777
Look, man, I know I messed up,
all right?

37:02.810 --> 37:06.414
But the facts are I died.

37:06.447 --> 37:08.282
I saw something.

37:08.316 --> 37:09.817
It led me to sarin gas.

37:09.851 --> 37:11.786
And when I got off track,
it led me back.

37:11.819 --> 37:13.521
How did it lead you back?

37:17.692 --> 37:20.161
- Your birds?
- Take a look.

37:21.829 --> 37:24.165
Guess what that number is.

37:24.198 --> 37:25.666
It's a rehab clinic.

37:29.203 --> 37:30.605
I was gonna walk away
from all of this--

37:30.638 --> 37:33.174
The sarin, the case...

37:34.575 --> 37:37.845
And then that appeared.
A bunch of those appeared.

37:37.879 --> 37:41.215
I know it's crazy
to be chasing birds.

37:41.215 --> 37:42.717
But at this point,

37:42.750 --> 37:46.354
looking at the evidence we have
and doing nothing is crazier.

37:48.189 --> 37:50.324
Ah...

37:50.324 --> 37:52.159
We got to try.

37:52.193 --> 37:55.429
Mike, if you slip up,

37:55.463 --> 37:59.166
if I catch even a whiff
of relapse--

37:59.200 --> 38:02.336
and believe, brother,
I know what it smells like--

38:02.370 --> 38:03.571
you're done, man.

38:03.604 --> 38:06.741
I'm gonna have to call you in,
for your own good.

38:06.774 --> 38:09.143
I know.

38:11.545 --> 38:13.114
Thanks.

38:13.114 --> 38:15.249
Yeah.

38:15.283 --> 38:17.451
I'm proud of you, Mike.

38:25.726 --> 38:28.329
I must say, it rarely takes me
three full days

38:28.362 --> 38:30.631
- to be granted an audience.
- Truly, sir, I'm sorry.

38:30.631 --> 38:31.632
I was cultivating a cover--

38:31.632 --> 38:32.833
I don't care
about that, Warren.

38:32.867 --> 38:34.368
Some time ago
you came to my office.

38:34.402 --> 38:35.636
You said
you know Paul Briggs.

38:35.636 --> 38:37.471
You said you know
what he's capable of.

38:37.505 --> 38:39.774
What is Paul Briggs
capable of?

38:39.774 --> 38:41.242
I'm not sure
I'm following, sir.

38:41.275 --> 38:43.277
What's he planning?

38:44.779 --> 38:48.115
I don't think
he's planning anything.

38:48.149 --> 38:50.117
I think he's committed
to taking down the Sarkissians,

38:50.151 --> 38:51.786
despite the fact
that you're going got make him

38:51.819 --> 38:54.422
take the fall for it.

38:54.455 --> 38:57.692
You backed him
into an impossible corner.

39:01.128 --> 39:02.863
Agent Warren?

39:07.401 --> 39:10.271
Sorry. I wish I had
more to tell you.

39:10.304 --> 39:12.773
If Paul's up to something,
it's news to me.

39:12.807 --> 39:14.141
Anything else, sir?

39:14.141 --> 39:16.110
No, you're free to go.

39:57.585 --> 39:59.587
[sighs]

39:59.587 --> 40:02.590
[sniffles]

40:18.472 --> 40:21.542
[sniffles]

40:21.575 --> 40:24.578
[crying]
