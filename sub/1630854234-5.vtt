00:01.436 --> 00:03.351
<i>Previously on "Chucky"...</i>

00:03.351 --> 00:05.657
Last chance.
How many of you are there?

00:05.657 --> 00:08.399
My situation here
couldn't possibly get worse.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.097
In order
to forgive ourselves,

00:10.097 --> 00:13.448
first, we have to forgive those
who have sinned against us.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.406
If I really wanna
forgive myself,

00:15.406 --> 00:18.322
<i>I have to be able
to forgive him first.</i>

00:18.322 --> 00:20.498
We call this aversion.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.196
The thought of violence is
actually making him sick now.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.415
Hi, I'm Chucky.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.852
We didn't brainwash him.
We brain bleached him.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.071
Don't you see him?

00:28.071 --> 00:30.117
Our Lord's image plain
as day right here

00:30.117 --> 00:32.075
in this doll's face.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.337
<i>I'm not going. I can't.</i>

00:33.337 --> 00:35.078
Mom needs help.
We all do.

00:35.078 --> 00:38.690
Just ask her,
"Who's Tiffany Valentine?"

00:39.865 --> 00:41.998
<i>No!</i>

00:43.913 --> 00:46.829
See you forever, Alexandra.

00:46.829 --> 00:49.049
<i>How do we know
if this was Chucky anyways?</i>

00:49.049 --> 00:50.441
Who else would do this?

00:50.441 --> 00:51.790
I would say Trevor,
but you're currently standing

00:51.790 --> 00:52.748
in a puddle of him.

00:55.185 --> 00:58.884
I don't usually
eat cream puffs.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.886
But today is a cheat day.

01:12.376 --> 01:15.727
Beautiful, aren't they?

01:15.727 --> 01:17.903
This one is for Lexy.

01:19.296 --> 01:23.431
Just picture it jutting
out of her heart.

01:23.431 --> 01:26.086
If that little bitch
had a heart.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.306
Don't you ever say her name.

01:29.306 --> 01:31.830
Lexy's my friend.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.093
They're all my friends.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.746
My God.

01:34.746 --> 01:38.141
What the hell did those
monsters do to you, soldier?

01:38.141 --> 01:40.012
I knew it.
There's another one.

01:40.012 --> 01:43.799
This one here is for Devon.

01:43.799 --> 01:49.587
This jagged blade is gonna make
him scream like a little girl.

01:57.378 --> 02:02.600
And these are for you
and your good buddy, Jake.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.168
Friends till the fuckin' end.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.090
Ah!

02:16.832 --> 02:18.399
Ha.

02:20.314 --> 02:23.143
What the fuck, Chuck?

02:23.143 --> 02:26.189
How did you get
to be such a wuss?

02:26.189 --> 02:28.452
I found something
better than killing.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.324
Don't tell me.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.978
You found it in there?

02:34.806 --> 02:37.287
Chucky, open the door!

02:37.287 --> 02:42.336
Chucky?

02:44.555 --> 02:45.817
Ahh!

02:51.780 --> 02:53.260
Chucky!

02:53.260 --> 02:54.652
Hey, you leave him alone.

02:54.652 --> 02:58.003
Face it.
You're not good, Chucky.

02:58.003 --> 03:00.702
I am Good Chucky.

03:00.702 --> 03:01.964
I am.

03:01.964 --> 03:03.748
- Good Chucky.
- No.

03:03.748 --> 03:08.188
You're supposed
to be a killer, like me.

03:12.409 --> 03:15.195
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

03:15.195 --> 03:16.544
Jake.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.328
There's nothing you can do, okay?

03:18.328 --> 03:20.374
Just let them take
each other out.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.245
Ah! Ah! Ah!

03:22.245 --> 03:24.247
Look, I gotta help him.

03:24.247 --> 03:26.728
Ahh!

03:26.728 --> 03:27.903
Chucky?

03:27.903 --> 03:30.340
Chucky, are you okay?

03:30.340 --> 03:33.256
You give us a bad name.

03:33.256 --> 03:36.912
You're weak, pathetic.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.522
You're nothing.

03:38.522 --> 03:41.656
You're the Chucky
no one will remember.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.919
Chucky, let me help you!

03:58.194 --> 04:00.327
Ah!

04:01.893 --> 04:04.287
I'm the Chucky
I choose to be,

04:04.287 --> 04:05.723
asshole.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.382
Yah!

04:12.382 --> 04:16.952
Ohh, ahh--

04:39.191 --> 04:41.585
How--how did I do, coach?

04:41.585 --> 04:43.761
You did great, Good Chucky.

05:17.578 --> 05:20.537
Good Chucky, huh?

05:20.537 --> 05:22.104
Look at what he did, Jake.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.672
He's a killing machine.

05:24.672 --> 05:27.370
Devon, he saved our lives.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.589
He saved us from Chucky.

05:28.589 --> 05:29.981
He is Chucky.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.593
I feel like
I don't even know

05:32.593 --> 05:34.377
how to talk to you anymore.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.336
It's like I don't
even know you.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.120
What are you talking about?

05:39.643 --> 05:43.168
Jake, we're supposed to
see each other every weekend.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.997
And now, we're
at the fucking Sistine Chapel,

05:45.997 --> 05:48.609
as created by everyone's
favorite homicidal maniac.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.700
He killed Trevor.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.094
How long before he kills
someone you love, again?

05:56.094 --> 05:57.792
It was that Chucky
who killed Trevor.

05:57.792 --> 06:02.449
And that was a different Chucky
who killed Gary, not him.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.668
Gary's never
coming back, Jake.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.018
But you still have me.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.846
And I'm not gonna let
Chucky take you, too.

06:10.631 --> 06:13.373
There is no Good Chucky.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.332
Huh?

06:22.947 --> 06:25.428
That was awkward.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.749
Devon!

06:46.667 --> 06:50.322
I find this act
of blasphemy deeply disturbing.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.024
God damn it.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.741
What are we gonna do, Lexy?

07:17.741 --> 07:21.179
What are we gonna
do about [whispers] Trevor?

07:21.179 --> 07:23.704
I mean, can we bury him?

07:23.704 --> 07:27.534
No, we can't bury him--
it.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.666
Can we bury it/him?

07:31.799 --> 07:34.932
It's just--it's not fair.

07:34.932 --> 07:38.283
You don't look so good.
I'm worried about you.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.677
You're worried about me?

07:41.504 --> 07:44.551
There's a corpse in the closet
and a killer doll on the loose.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.509
I'm worried about me.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.816
Fuck, Nadine!

07:50.426 --> 07:52.472
Don't.
I'm going to the bathroom.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.648
I need to be alone.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.496
If you don't quit
while you're ahead,

08:16.496 --> 08:18.672
you're going to die.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.982
I don't know what you're
talking about, Nadine.

08:24.982 --> 08:27.594
I do know something
about what

08:27.594 --> 08:29.552
you're going through, Lexy.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.728
I've seen it close-up before.

08:33.208 --> 08:37.604
Have you ever had a pet
that was your bestie?

08:38.692 --> 08:42.130
I had five gerbils.

08:42.130 --> 08:45.655
I got one each birthday,
and soon after,

08:45.655 --> 08:47.701
I would get home from school,

08:47.701 --> 08:51.835
and my mom would tell me
that they ran away.

08:51.835 --> 08:54.838
And each one of those days,

08:54.838 --> 08:58.146
I would feel like
my world was over.

09:00.235 --> 09:03.238
I couldn't figure it out.

09:03.238 --> 09:06.415
Why would they leave me?

09:06.415 --> 09:10.419
But the fifth gerbil, Houdini,

09:10.419 --> 09:12.726
was there when I got back.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.990
Fourth grade.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.296
Mom had left the cage open,

09:18.296 --> 09:22.039
and he was scurrying around
on the floor.

09:23.606 --> 09:26.522
She was passed out,

09:26.522 --> 09:31.919
and she wouldn't
wake up that time.

09:32.702 --> 09:35.575
I don't think she ever wanted
me to have any of them at all.

09:35.575 --> 09:39.883
But you know how moms are.

09:39.883 --> 09:42.930
They do their best
to make you happy, right?

09:47.499 --> 09:50.241
Can you open the door now?

10:08.303 --> 10:10.174
I'm sorry.

10:13.395 --> 10:15.745
I'm so sorry.

10:15.745 --> 10:19.488
It's okay.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.925
It's gonna be okay.

10:24.972 --> 10:28.584
You know, doing the right
thing should be a crime.

10:31.543 --> 10:35.286
Oh, okay. Oh, okay.

10:35.286 --> 10:36.636
You know what?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.550
You trying to kill me?

10:38.550 --> 10:42.642
I'm not, but about that.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.339
Yeah, right.

10:46.428 --> 10:49.910
Me and those two dorks have
taken down Chucky before,

10:49.910 --> 10:52.216
and we're gonna do it again.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.873
You believe me, don't you?

10:56.873 --> 10:59.180
Of course
I believe in you, Lexy.

11:01.835 --> 11:06.753
Mr. Pasta would have a lot
to say about this whole mess.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.407
Yeah.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.758
What would he say?

11:11.758 --> 11:13.498
Don't be silly, Lexy.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.805
Cats can't talk.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.688
<i>I'm contesting custody.</i>

12:56.688 --> 12:58.081
<i>What?</i>

12:58.081 --> 12:59.735
<i>If I get sole custody
of the kids,</i>

12:59.735 --> 13:02.129
<i>that's another 10 grand
in child support payments.</i>

13:02.129 --> 13:03.870
<i>You just won $11 million.</i>

13:03.870 --> 13:06.873
<i>Hey, I'm the victim here.
You said it yourself.</i>

13:06.873 --> 13:08.526
<i>Now I'm gonna hit him
where it hurts.</i>

13:08.526 --> 13:10.790
- Mom.
- What?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.226
We need to talk.

13:12.226 --> 13:15.229
Glen, there's nothing to say.

13:15.229 --> 13:16.926
Excuse me.
Can you move a little?

13:16.926 --> 13:18.972
I'm trying to watch my show.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.497
Glen, what are you doing?

13:22.497 --> 13:25.935
You don't get
to play the victim here.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.937
You murder people.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.983
Glen, it's an addiction.

13:29.983 --> 13:32.159
Have a little compassion.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.814
I can't help it.
I just like to murder people.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.598
Is that so bad?

13:36.598 --> 13:38.730
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.645
And I don't know
who the child

13:40.645 --> 13:43.039
in front of me is, either.

13:43.039 --> 13:47.478
The child I know would
never betray their mother.

13:47.478 --> 13:51.091
What did you expect me to do,
just act like you

13:51.091 --> 13:56.009
keeping a prisoner
who you dismembered was normal?

14:00.317 --> 14:04.104
Let's just start with who
Nica is and what happened.

14:05.366 --> 14:10.110
If you must know,
Nica's my girlfriend.

14:10.110 --> 14:14.549
And sometimes your father.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.594
Stop lying to me!

14:16.594 --> 14:19.206
Don't use that tone to me.

14:19.206 --> 14:22.774
I may be a murderess,
but I'm still your mother.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.994
Okay, Mom,

14:24.994 --> 14:26.909
who's Tiffany Valentine?

14:26.909 --> 14:29.216
I'm not saying anything
until you tell me

14:29.216 --> 14:31.435
where Glenda took Nica.

14:32.959 --> 14:36.397
No? No?

14:36.397 --> 14:40.270
All of a sudden,
you have nothing to say.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.838
All right, I'm out of here.

14:44.709 --> 14:48.061
Enjoy the show, sweet face.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.555
Maybe it's a miracle?

15:57.391 --> 16:00.437
Hey, you know,
you saved us back there.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.484
I mean,
you're basically my hero.

16:04.485 --> 16:07.053
Just doing my job.

16:09.403 --> 16:12.754
So what did it feel like

16:12.754 --> 16:14.669
when you killed him?

16:16.453 --> 16:18.934
Like I finally
knew what I was for.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.244
Um--

16:24.244 --> 16:26.289
Here.

16:31.642 --> 16:32.817
There you go.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.645
All better, Boy Wonder.

16:34.645 --> 16:37.605
Holy hematoma, Batman.

16:37.605 --> 16:40.216
The Joker got me good.

16:41.174 --> 16:48.050
And the citizens of Gotham
will pay us in chocolate.

16:55.405 --> 16:57.277
My sweet baby boy.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.105
Uh, what's going on?

17:00.715 --> 17:02.978
Trevor's gone.

17:02.978 --> 17:05.111
Wait.
What do you mean Trevor's gone?

17:05.111 --> 17:07.156
As in not
in the place we left him.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.071
What happened to him?

17:09.071 --> 17:11.247
Good Chucky was saving us
from this other Chucky

17:11.247 --> 17:13.336
that was stalking the halls.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.034
My sweet baby.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.211
That mean, mean man isn't ever
going to hurt you ever again.

17:21.823 --> 17:26.132
- You guys seen Devon?
- No, but...

17:26.132 --> 17:28.177
we don't know how many
Chuckys are out there.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.484
What if one found Devon?

17:30.484 --> 17:32.573
No, he's fine.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.445
He's just being dramatic
and punishing me.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.795
I know you guys are going
through a rough patch,

17:37.795 --> 17:39.101
but you love each other.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.016
Will you please
stop fighting that?

17:41.016 --> 17:43.192
We've got actual things
to fight against.

17:44.541 --> 17:45.890
Yeah.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.677
Who would take
Trevor's body, though?

17:49.677 --> 17:51.331
An ally?

17:51.331 --> 17:53.463
Or an enemy?

17:58.903 --> 18:03.299
I've tried so hard, Devon,
with you and your friends.

18:03.299 --> 18:07.086
I've given you the benefit
of the doubt time and again.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.827
But, clearly, your particular
brand of wickedness

18:09.827 --> 18:13.570
is going to need a firmer hand
to be corrected.

18:16.965 --> 18:19.185
You're absolutely right, Father.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.317
How could I
possibly convince a believer

18:21.317 --> 18:23.841
of supernatural evil?

18:23.841 --> 18:26.801
It must just be a series
of violent, elaborate pranks

18:26.801 --> 18:30.239
pulled off
by some traumatized teenagers.

18:33.024 --> 18:35.897
Open Leviticus,
and read it.

18:46.908 --> 18:48.997
Father Bryce,
I have asked you repeatedly

18:48.997 --> 18:51.652
not to interrupt me when I'm
in session with the students.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.220
My time here is precious.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.178
- This couldn't wait.
- Sin never waits.

18:56.178 --> 18:59.094
Does it, Father?
- Sin never waits, does it?

19:10.018 --> 19:12.716
Who should we blame for this?

19:12.716 --> 19:15.806
Please, tell me.

19:15.806 --> 19:18.244
Sister Catherine?

19:18.244 --> 19:20.289
No smart tongue today?

19:20.289 --> 19:23.597
How convenient.

19:23.597 --> 19:26.774
Dr. Mixter, what about you?

19:26.774 --> 19:28.515
Weren't you the one
that recommended

19:28.515 --> 19:31.909
these violent kids be admitted
here in the first place?

19:31.909 --> 19:34.042
And where have you been
during their reign of terror

19:34.042 --> 19:35.217
throughout these hallways,

19:35.217 --> 19:38.002
this sick abandon
of everything holy,

19:38.002 --> 19:39.395
what God is trying
to tell them,

19:39.395 --> 19:43.617
what I, Dr. Mixter,
am trying to help them see?

19:47.011 --> 19:48.883
Do you not take
any responsibility?

19:50.406 --> 19:52.191
Father--

19:55.411 --> 19:57.848
As always, I have stepped in

19:57.848 --> 20:00.982
and done what
you are too weak to do.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.984
That's why Devon
is currently reading the Bible

20:02.984 --> 20:05.291
in the chapel by himself.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.249
And that's where
he will remain until--

20:07.249 --> 20:09.860
Father Bryce,
is that really necessary?

20:09.860 --> 20:11.514
Maybe these kids need
someone to talk to.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.734
I mean, are you punishing him
for blasphemy

20:13.734 --> 20:15.257
or for creative prowess?

20:15.257 --> 20:16.911
Why not both?

20:16.911 --> 20:18.956
Because curiosity
isn't a sin.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.697
Challenging the institutions
that guide us

20:20.697 --> 20:22.177
should be encouraged,
not rejected.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.310
Sister Catherine,
not everything is a challenge.

20:24.310 --> 20:27.008
Dr. Mixter,
please help me out here.

20:27.008 --> 20:32.405
Actually,
I do agree with Father Bryce.

20:32.405 --> 20:38.367
This is a display of violence
and casual pageantry,

20:38.367 --> 20:40.195
and it crosses the line.

20:40.195 --> 20:41.718
Spare me.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.459
If you're feeling a lack
of control of the student body,

20:43.459 --> 20:45.156
maybe it's because
you're lacking it, Father.

20:45.156 --> 20:47.289
Devon is a traumatized kid.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.902
This isn't trauma.
This is evil.

20:51.902 --> 20:56.211
- Evil.
- Sister Ruth, please.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.387
I did not become
a Sister to validate

20:58.387 --> 21:01.172
or answer to your fits
of self-righteousness.

21:01.172 --> 21:03.044
This is not an inquisition.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.959
That's exactly what it is,

21:04.959 --> 21:07.918
an inquisition by me.

21:09.964 --> 21:12.358
Those medieval relics
look good in this office.

21:12.358 --> 21:16.405
Maybe next time, we can burn a
kid at the stake. Hm.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.112
Devon has--

21:28.112 --> 21:32.552
Devon has exhausted his options
here in Incarnate Lord.

21:32.552 --> 21:35.381
Maybe they can straighten
him out in a youth facility.

21:35.381 --> 21:39.210
I disagree with you.
I think I can still help him.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.476
I hope you're right.

21:43.476 --> 21:45.869
Sister Ruth,

21:45.869 --> 21:47.567
get rid of that abomination.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.482
Yes, Father.

21:55.705 --> 21:58.404
Not here, Sister Ruth.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.970
Yes, Father.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.711
Get it out of my sight.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.844
Yes, Father.

22:29.739 --> 22:32.525
This is bullshit.

22:59.813 --> 23:06.167
So, Meg,
did you enjoy the party?

23:06.167 --> 23:11.999
It was--
it was certainly dramatic.

23:11.999 --> 23:16.743
Thank you.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.701
I hope Glenda
comes back soon.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.486
Don't you, Glen?

23:20.486 --> 23:21.965
Yes.

23:21.965 --> 23:25.012
Where did that
sibling get off to?

23:25.012 --> 23:29.233
It's so seldom
we see the two of you apart.

23:29.233 --> 23:32.454
You know, once I caught
them trying to board a plane

23:32.454 --> 23:35.152
to England, alone.

23:35.152 --> 23:38.634
They are such a bonded pair.

23:38.634 --> 23:42.029
They certainly
can be a handful.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.857
So could we
when we were younger.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.380
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.164
You remember
that time in high school

23:47.164 --> 23:49.863
when we snuck out to meet
with the Dean brothers?

23:49.863 --> 23:52.431
- Yes, yes.
- What were their names?

23:52.431 --> 23:54.128
I don't--

23:54.128 --> 23:56.565
Chandler and Ram?

23:56.565 --> 23:59.525
What? Ra--

23:59.525 --> 24:01.570
It was so long ago.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.878
It was almost like
we were different people.

24:04.878 --> 24:08.185
I wanna be Jennifer Tilly.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.535
I wanna be a star.

24:12.407 --> 24:17.543
And switch and switch,
switch, switch, switch.

24:17.543 --> 24:22.852
So how long
are you planning to stay?

24:22.852 --> 24:24.288
As long as it takes.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.203
- Oh, oh, dear.
- Mm-hmm.

24:26.203 --> 24:28.249
Yeah, okay. Hm--

24:28.249 --> 24:31.644
If you'll excuse me
for a minute, I just--

24:31.644 --> 24:33.602
I'll get--I'll be right back.

24:33.602 --> 24:35.952
And--ooh.

24:35.952 --> 24:37.388
Uh-uh.

24:37.388 --> 24:40.043
Nosy, nosy, nosy.

25:11.466 --> 25:13.076
More bills.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.514
Do you have a check for me?

25:17.951 --> 25:21.302
Hm, isn't that precious?

25:21.302 --> 25:23.609
Nice try, Jennifer.

25:23.609 --> 25:27.221
Now you're just going
to have to write it again.

25:27.221 --> 25:29.963
But I'm starving.

25:29.963 --> 25:31.965
You promised me chocolate.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.532
Chocolate?

25:33.532 --> 25:36.883
Oh, I love that portrait of me.

25:36.883 --> 25:38.841
I look so beautiful.

25:38.841 --> 25:41.583
That's me!
I look beautiful.

25:41.583 --> 25:44.630
Anyhow, there's something
even more important

25:44.630 --> 25:46.240
that I need from you.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.504
Tiffany, what more
could I possibly give you?

25:49.504 --> 25:53.160
For years, I've made you
money playing online poker

25:53.160 --> 25:55.728
and voicing Bonnie
on "Family Guy."

25:55.728 --> 26:01.168
I pay the bills and answer
all my own fan mail.

26:01.168 --> 26:03.083
And for what?

26:03.083 --> 26:05.520
Just a little bit of chocolate.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.261
That's all I ask.

26:07.261 --> 26:10.003
Shut up with the exposition, Jennifer.

26:10.003 --> 26:14.268
I need answers about you.

26:14.268 --> 26:15.835
Why, you ask?

26:15.835 --> 26:18.664
- Actually, I didn't.
- I'm about to embark

26:18.664 --> 26:22.537
on my greatest
acting challenge yet.

26:22.537 --> 26:26.541
I need to convince
your sister, Meg,

26:26.541 --> 26:31.285
that I'm you, Jennifer Tilly.

26:32.416 --> 26:35.071
Meg is here?

26:35.071 --> 26:39.859
Now, tell me
about those Dean brothers.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.612
What's going on?

26:54.700 --> 26:56.919
- Trevor's missing.
- What?

26:56.919 --> 27:01.010
Either he crossed over into
Narnia or someone took him.

27:01.010 --> 27:03.709
Fingers crossed for Narnia,
but I'm pretty sure

27:03.709 --> 27:05.972
that's not a real place.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.843
He wasn't in the closet
when we came back

27:07.843 --> 27:10.237
from the bathroom.
- Wait,

27:10.237 --> 27:13.109
maybe someone was cleaning up
for the other Chucky,

27:13.109 --> 27:15.111
like the bad one?

27:15.111 --> 27:16.939
Well,
the Good Chucky was texting

27:16.939 --> 27:18.680
somebody named the Colonel.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.161
Maybe they're the ones
that took Trevor.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.252
We should look
through this again,

27:25.252 --> 27:27.341
see if we missed anything.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.781
I sure hope you find Trevor.

27:35.697 --> 27:39.135
I just feel so bad.

27:39.135 --> 27:42.443
Who would do
something like that?

27:42.443 --> 27:44.184
Are you fucking kidding me?

27:44.184 --> 27:45.228
- Devon.
- You,

27:45.228 --> 27:47.187
you would do
something like that.

27:47.187 --> 27:49.668
You killed my mom.
You killed her dad.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.408
What?

27:51.408 --> 27:52.583
You're basically responsible

27:52.583 --> 27:54.150
for killing
Jake's whole family.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.978
But for some reason,
he doesn't seem

27:55.978 --> 27:57.240
to care about any of that.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.938
Because that wasn't
his fault.

27:58.938 --> 28:01.549
That was a different Chucky.
He's not like that anymore.

28:08.164 --> 28:12.691
I--I--

28:12.691 --> 28:14.605
I have to go.

28:14.605 --> 28:16.825
Chucky, wait, you can't--

28:41.154 --> 28:44.766
Did I really do those things?

28:44.766 --> 28:47.682
Oh, no,
that was a different you.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.817
Like that other me,
the big guy.

28:51.817 --> 28:54.515
Yeah, exactly.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.778
There's a lot of you.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.780
But, you know,
you're all different.

28:58.780 --> 29:01.609
Where did we come from?

29:01.609 --> 29:05.178
Well, it all started
with this guy named Charles.

29:05.178 --> 29:07.876
He actually lived here
a long time ago,

29:07.876 --> 29:09.878
when he was a kid.

29:09.878 --> 29:12.620
And, well, when he grew up,

29:12.620 --> 29:14.448
he split his soul
into all of you.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.798
And that's why you're alive.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.061
Was he a good person?

29:22.761 --> 29:26.982
If I came from someone bad,
that means that I'm bad too.

29:26.982 --> 29:29.811
That means I could hurt you.
- No, no.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.726
I shouldn't be around anyone!

29:31.726 --> 29:34.860
No, I--I want you here.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.818
- Why?
- Because you're good.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.515
Look, I know you're good.

29:38.515 --> 29:43.085
But what if there's
still evil inside me, too?

29:46.872 --> 29:48.003
Wait, you know what?

29:48.003 --> 29:50.005
Look, I have an idea.

29:50.005 --> 29:52.225
But we're gonna need some help.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.714
So you and Jake?

30:03.714 --> 30:05.542
Yeah, yeah.

30:05.542 --> 30:07.631
Not great.

30:07.631 --> 30:10.330
Understatement
of the century.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.898
I mean, do you get
this whole Good Chucky thing?

30:12.898 --> 30:14.813
'Cause I don't.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.991
Every time I look at him,
I see Junior's face.

30:21.907 --> 30:24.910
I just feel like he doesn't
hear me sometimes, you know?

30:24.910 --> 30:27.216
Or he won't.

30:27.216 --> 30:30.393
Chucky fucks everything up.

30:30.393 --> 30:32.613
Maybe.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.876
- Maybe?
- I mean, yeah,

30:34.876 --> 30:38.053
but even when we thought
Chucky was dead, Jake--

30:38.053 --> 30:41.317
I mean, none of us ever
saw each other, ever.

30:41.317 --> 30:44.103
Maybe Chucky's
not the only problem.

30:44.103 --> 30:49.108
I mean, I wanted to talk
to you guys every single day.

30:49.108 --> 30:52.415
Everything just felt so hard.

30:55.070 --> 30:58.813
I just don't want Jake
to get himself killed, or us.

30:58.813 --> 31:02.382
He's lost touch with reality.

31:02.382 --> 31:04.601
So what do you
wanna do about it?

31:17.658 --> 31:20.095
It's like looking
through my mom's Instagram.

31:20.095 --> 31:22.489
Wait, wait, go back.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.622
What's that?

31:25.622 --> 31:28.843
Is that a doll's foot?

31:30.845 --> 31:32.934
Go to the next one.

31:35.545 --> 31:38.374
There, an arm.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.289
What the hell?

31:45.077 --> 31:47.775
I think they're bread crumbs.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.255
What?

31:49.255 --> 31:51.083
You know,
like "Hansel and Gretel,"

31:51.083 --> 31:52.258
like he's leaving
a trail for himself

31:52.258 --> 31:54.173
to find his way back home.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.176
We have to get out there.

31:57.176 --> 32:00.701
Maybe this trail will lead
to more dolls or this Colonel.

32:00.701 --> 32:02.833
If they don't see us coming,

32:02.833 --> 32:05.097
maybe we can take 'em out
for good.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.839
Should we tell Jake?

32:08.839 --> 32:10.363
So what do we do now?

32:10.363 --> 32:13.540
So then, the priest
usually says something like,

32:13.540 --> 32:18.240
"What do you ask
of God's church for Chucky?"

32:18.240 --> 32:20.416
I ask for a clean slate.

32:20.416 --> 32:21.852
Cool.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.377
You could've also
just said baptism.

32:24.377 --> 32:25.813
Oh.

32:25.813 --> 32:27.380
Oh, right.

32:27.380 --> 32:29.904
Godparents,
they're usually part of this.

32:29.904 --> 32:32.080
You know, like,
the people who are, like,

32:32.080 --> 32:33.995
going to guide the baby--

32:33.995 --> 32:37.651
the Chucky during its life.

32:37.651 --> 32:39.522
You.

32:39.522 --> 32:43.004
You could be my godfather, Jake.

32:44.527 --> 32:46.965
Oh, yeah, sure.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.270
Wow.

32:48.270 --> 32:51.491
Do you wanna be the godmother?

32:51.491 --> 32:54.929
I would love to.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.670
both: Aww.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.586
Okay.

32:59.586 --> 33:02.110
Then there's some questions.

33:02.110 --> 33:04.634
Do you renounce Satan,
and his works,

33:04.634 --> 33:07.811
and all his service,
and all his pride?

33:07.811 --> 33:09.378
Yes, yeah.

33:09.378 --> 33:12.120
Okay,
that's a yes for me, too.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.557
Do you unite yourself
unto Christ?

33:18.866 --> 33:20.520
You know,
let's just skip the rest.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.000
You get the gist.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.610
Okay, now it's time
to pour the water.

33:25.786 --> 33:27.657
Okay.

33:27.657 --> 33:29.877
Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

33:29.877 --> 33:33.968
Okay, buddy.
I'm just gonna--

33:33.968 --> 33:35.535
Just put you right there.

33:35.535 --> 33:37.058
There we go.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.755
All right.

33:38.755 --> 33:41.932
I baptize you
in the name of the Father...

33:46.763 --> 33:48.156
The Son...

33:50.767 --> 33:52.508
And the Holy Spirit.

33:54.641 --> 33:57.252
Amen.

33:57.252 --> 33:59.776
Okay, well, that's it.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.214
You're clean now.

34:02.214 --> 34:03.519
No more evil.

34:03.519 --> 34:04.955
Wow!

34:04.955 --> 34:07.175
What a feeling!

34:07.175 --> 34:09.090
And it was so easy.

34:09.090 --> 34:10.439
Thank you.

34:10.439 --> 34:12.311
♪ Thank you, Jake,
thank you, Jake ♪

34:12.311 --> 34:14.095

34:26.020 --> 34:28.588
Come on.
We're on our own now.

35:09.890 --> 35:12.153
What in the name of heaven?

35:36.395 --> 35:41.095
I am risen!

35:44.011 --> 35:47.188
You are risen indeed, Lord.

35:47.188 --> 35:51.105
And it didn't even
take me three days.

35:53.368 --> 35:56.197
I knew it.
I knew it was you.

35:59.287 --> 36:02.334
How can I serve thee, Lord?

36:19.568 --> 36:21.701
♪ Ta-da

36:21.701 --> 36:24.094
Oh, a new outfit.

36:24.094 --> 36:28.621
Yes, in this house,
we dress for dinner.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.234
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

36:33.234 --> 36:34.540
Meg.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.672
Meggy, Meggy, Meggy, come here.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.370
Sit here.

36:38.370 --> 36:40.763
You know, when you were talking

36:40.763 --> 36:42.809
about the Dean brothers earlier,

36:42.809 --> 36:45.507
it really brought back
some memories.

36:45.507 --> 36:46.856
Oh, such as?

36:46.856 --> 36:49.032
Yes, like,
remember when they wanted

36:49.032 --> 36:50.556
to raise money
for the orphanage

36:50.556 --> 36:52.035
that they grew up in?

36:52.035 --> 36:54.516
So they got
the whole band back together.

36:54.516 --> 36:56.388
And then the cops
were after them

36:56.388 --> 36:58.955
for their unpaid
parking tickets.

36:58.955 --> 37:02.524
But they still managed to play
the Palace Hotel ballroom.

37:02.524 --> 37:04.265
And then
they got thrown in jail,

37:04.265 --> 37:07.442
but they still managed
to save the orphanage.

37:07.442 --> 37:09.227
- Jennifer?
- Yes?

37:09.227 --> 37:12.142
That is the plot of
"The Blues Brothers."

37:14.580 --> 37:15.929
Shut up.
It is not.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.452
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

37:17.452 --> 37:19.759
Yes, it is.

37:21.630 --> 37:24.677
That bitch!

37:24.677 --> 37:26.592
Excuse me?

37:26.592 --> 37:29.159
I have to go.

37:29.159 --> 37:32.859
Jennifer?

37:34.077 --> 37:35.644
Jen?

37:36.863 --> 37:40.127
Yeah, I don't--

37:48.527 --> 37:51.660
You tricked me,
you little troll.

37:53.096 --> 37:55.011
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.187
You're a disgusting little
smarty pants, aren't you?

37:57.187 --> 37:59.799
I am going to make you sorry
you ever were born.

37:59.799 --> 38:02.323
I am going to make
your life so miserable.

38:02.323 --> 38:05.457
You are going to be the most
unhappy dolly in the world.

38:05.457 --> 38:07.328
- Mom?
- You--

38:10.331 --> 38:12.638
What the fuck?

38:12.638 --> 38:14.857
It's not what it looks like.

38:14.857 --> 38:17.817
- Jennifer--
- Oh, Meg, it's me, Jennifer.

38:17.817 --> 38:19.732
In here.
I'm in here.

38:21.516 --> 38:23.605
Meg, it's me.

38:23.605 --> 38:25.477
It's not what
what looks like?

38:25.477 --> 38:26.956
What is going on here?

38:26.956 --> 38:31.352
Please, please, help me.

38:31.352 --> 38:35.835
I'm trapped.
- Jennifer?

38:36.879 --> 38:39.752
Jennifer. Jen--
- Ah--

38:39.752 --> 38:41.231
Oh, my God.

38:43.190 --> 38:45.235
Oh, my God. How?

38:46.324 --> 38:47.716
Meg, look out!

38:47.716 --> 38:49.936
Ah!

38:55.115 --> 38:56.725
No!

38:59.162 --> 39:01.339
No! No!

39:08.911 --> 39:14.003
Ohh!

39:14.003 --> 39:16.005
I'm sorry.
- Meg.

39:16.005 --> 39:20.096
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

39:20.096 --> 39:23.752
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

39:23.752 --> 39:27.016
I'm sorry.
- Tiffany, what have you done?

39:27.016 --> 39:31.586
She was my sister.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39:31.586 --> 39:34.023
Who are you?

39:36.243 --> 39:39.202
My name is Tiffany Valentine,

39:39.202 --> 39:42.423
and I'm your goddamn mother.

39:57.699 --> 39:59.309
There.

40:03.052 --> 40:06.578
Couldn't he have just
dropped a pin or something?

40:06.578 --> 40:08.754
Hey, we're getting closer.

40:08.754 --> 40:10.190
Okay?

40:10.190 --> 40:11.931
Let's keep going.

40:15.674 --> 40:17.458
Ugh.

40:17.458 --> 40:20.679
You fucking monster!

40:20.679 --> 40:23.551
I know how this
all must sound.

40:23.551 --> 40:25.510
Take your time, sweet face.

40:25.510 --> 40:28.948
I'll kill you.
I'll fucking kill you.

40:28.948 --> 40:30.471
Mommy's here.

40:30.471 --> 40:35.128
You fucking maniac!
You bitch!

40:35.128 --> 40:37.783
I really hate you!

40:37.783 --> 40:42.918
I hate you! I hate you!

40:42.918 --> 40:45.660
If you'll excuse me
for just one minute?

40:47.706 --> 40:52.232
I am trying to have
an important conversation

40:52.232 --> 40:53.842
with my child.

40:53.842 --> 40:57.542
If you don't shut up, I will
lock you down here to starve.

40:57.542 --> 40:59.500
Do you understand me?

40:59.500 --> 41:02.111
No more chocolate!

41:04.636 --> 41:06.464
Ah!

41:06.464 --> 41:09.075
Now shut the fuck up.

41:14.167 --> 41:17.562
Sorry. Sorry about that.

41:20.521 --> 41:23.263
You lied to us

41:23.263 --> 41:25.657
our whole lives.

41:27.006 --> 41:29.661
Well, yes.

41:29.661 --> 41:32.794
But it's complicated.

41:32.794 --> 41:36.537
I never meant
to hurt you and Glenda.

41:36.537 --> 41:41.063
I just--I wanted
to give you everything.

41:41.063 --> 41:45.851
Tiffany--
Tiffany Valentine is a loser,

41:45.851 --> 41:48.418
but Jennifer Tilly

41:48.418 --> 41:52.597
is a beautiful,
beautiful movie star.

41:52.597 --> 41:55.991
I wanted you to be proud of me.

41:55.991 --> 41:58.646
But...

41:58.646 --> 42:03.999
I--I see now
that it was a mistake.

42:03.999 --> 42:07.655
I was never good
at being Jennifer Tilly.

42:07.655 --> 42:11.703
And I wasn't that good
of a mom, either.

42:11.703 --> 42:13.922
- Mm.
- I'm sorry.

42:13.922 --> 42:18.840
I was trying to be somebody
that I wasn't.

42:18.840 --> 42:22.017
And I did the same thing
to you kids, also.

42:24.933 --> 42:27.806
What do you mean?

42:27.806 --> 42:31.070
I have one last
birthday present for you.

42:48.522 --> 42:49.567
That belongs to you.

43:21.294 --> 43:23.775
It's me.

43:30.651 --> 43:32.740
What about Glenda?

43:32.740 --> 43:35.003
It's for them, too.

43:39.660 --> 43:42.750
I need to show this to them.

43:42.750 --> 43:46.275
Let's go get them.

43:46.275 --> 43:48.321
Ah--

44:53.516 --> 44:55.518
Look.

45:21.893 --> 45:24.156
What the fuck happened here?

45:25.635 --> 45:28.638
Every dead Chucky's
a win, right?

45:38.736 --> 45:40.259
Someone's inside.

45:57.493 --> 46:00.366
Holy shit.

46:00.366 --> 46:02.760
What the fuck is this?

46:07.112 --> 46:09.854
Jesus.

46:13.161 --> 46:14.989
Holy shit.

46:14.989 --> 46:16.121
Andy.

46:17.557 --> 46:20.255
Oh, my God.
He's alive.

46:26.784 --> 46:28.350
Charlie?

46:31.484 --> 46:33.660
Dr. Mixter?

46:33.660 --> 46:36.358
Charlie?

46:36.358 --> 46:39.187
That's Colonel to you.
