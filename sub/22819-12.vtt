WEBVTT

00:07.508 --> 00:11.846
<i>More, give me more Give me more</i>

00:12.805 --> 00:16.893
<i>If I had a heart
I could love you</i>

00:18.477 --> 00:22.440
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

00:24.358 --> 00:28.487
<i>After the night When I wake up</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:34.785
<i>I'll see What tomorrow brings</i>

00:41.209 --> 00:45.254
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

00:54.972 --> 00:56.557
Murderer!

01:12.615 --> 01:13.950
I was told he was dead.

01:14.033 --> 01:15.660
Killed at York.

01:16.327 --> 01:19.080
It seems the sons of Ragnar
fought among themselves.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.873
Heahmund was forced
to fight with them.

01:21.165 --> 01:22.583
He's lived among pagans.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.460
Do you suppose he has changed?

01:27.421 --> 01:28.464
Bring him here.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.176
Bring Bishop Heahmund.

01:40.059 --> 01:41.060
My lady.

01:41.644 --> 01:42.812
Your Grace.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.734
Rise, Bishop Heahmund.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.406
You were taken captive.

01:53.489 --> 01:56.450
Yes, I fought in the great war
between the sons of Ragnar.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.786
The son, Ivar, the Boneless,

01:59.203 --> 02:00.204
was triumphant.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.164
I know Ivar.

02:02.832 --> 02:04.917
He came here
with Ragnar Lothbrok.

02:05.209 --> 02:07.420
I played games with him
when I was a boy.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.215
So you have returned with
the sons who were defeated.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.675
Yes.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.343
Why?

02:16.721 --> 02:19.307
Sire.
Why have they come here?

02:25.229 --> 02:27.023
I offered them safe passage.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.988
How easy it proves
to fool people. Hmm?

02:36.365 --> 02:37.366
Look at us!

02:37.950 --> 02:39.118
I have no fear of death.

02:39.744 --> 02:41.162
I will embrace it.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.372
But it is too early
for my children to die.

02:43.873 --> 02:45.875
We sailed right into a trap.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.960
Bishop Heahmund has betrayed us.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.587
I can't believe that.

02:49.754 --> 02:51.547
How else was
he going to get home?

02:52.715 --> 02:55.509
He needed a ship.
He needed a crew.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.678
We just gave him both.

02:57.762 --> 02:59.722
Imagine how famous
King Alfred will be

02:59.805 --> 03:01.640
when he shows
the Saxons our heads.

03:01.724 --> 03:03.601
And the best part about it is,

03:03.684 --> 03:05.436
we gave it to him on a plate!

03:06.604 --> 03:09.523
I still cannot believe
that he has betrayed us.

03:09.732 --> 03:11.776
And I cannot believe
the famous Lagertha

03:11.859 --> 03:13.694
has proved to be
a fool for love.

03:14.070 --> 03:16.655
Well, you have never been
a fool for love.

03:16.781 --> 03:17.782
Have you, Bjorn?

03:19.450 --> 03:22.161
This is where Ragnar was
imprisoned and betrayed.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.290
And now, we will
all die here too.

03:32.755 --> 03:35.841
I propose a toast
to Bishop Heahmund

03:36.509 --> 03:39.261
scourge of the Vikings
and Man of God.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.222
Bishop Heahmund.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.197
Dear gods,

03:59.824 --> 04:02.159
why did you decide
to spare me again?

04:03.702 --> 04:05.121
I don't understand.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.748
Is it a joke?

04:08.332 --> 04:10.918
Does it amuse you
to see me suffer?

04:14.046 --> 04:16.048
What good could I do
for these people?

04:17.550 --> 04:20.052
I've tried so hard
to make them see,

04:20.886 --> 04:22.680
but they are blind.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.937
Why don't you answer me?

04:31.522 --> 04:34.441
Why don't you show yourselves
to me as you used to?

04:37.111 --> 04:38.654
Perhaps you never did.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.616
Perhaps you never did.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.137
Get up!

05:05.681 --> 05:06.849
Move!

05:10.227 --> 05:11.478
Move!

05:13.939 --> 05:15.524
<i>I'm aware of who you are.</i>

05:15.608 --> 05:16.692
I'm not foolish enough

05:16.775 --> 05:18.903
not to recognize your
potential for my kingdom,

05:19.445 --> 05:21.447
if you are willing
to fight with us

05:21.530 --> 05:23.449
against the armies
of your countrymen.

05:24.742 --> 05:25.951
We may,

05:26.535 --> 05:29.246
on the condition
that you allow us to settle

05:29.330 --> 05:32.458
in the part of East Anglia
King Ecbert gave to us.

05:32.541 --> 05:35.628
I have every intention ofhononng
my grandfather's pledges.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.796
But first, you must
demonstrate your worth

05:37.880 --> 05:40.216
and your loyalty
to our cause in battle.

05:40.299 --> 05:42.218
We have a legal right
to that land.

05:42.718 --> 05:44.345
We accept your offer.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.641
I'm glad.
It was Bishop Heahmund

05:48.724 --> 05:51.018
who proposed the solution
which seemed to me wise.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.774
So, as long as
we're allies and friends,

05:56.857 --> 05:58.984
you are free to use
the Royal Villa as you wish.

05:59.068 --> 06:01.195
My servants are
also your servants.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.822
My kitchens and cellars
are there for your use.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.575
I believe you have
two young children with you.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.370
Let us have a care
for them also.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.288
Thank you, Lord King.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.420
We have fought against you

06:18.504 --> 06:20.339
and now we shall
fight together with you.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.008
I know my grandfather
King Ecbert would approve,

06:23.092 --> 06:25.302
for I know the love
he bore King Ragnar.

06:38.649 --> 06:39.650
Can I trust them?

06:40.234 --> 06:41.860
You can trust Lagertha.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.324
Sire.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.952
One small matter.

06:50.369 --> 06:52.079
I would like my bishopric back.

06:52.705 --> 06:55.874
I wish to be Bishop Heahmund
of Sherborne once more.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.461
My Lord, because we thought
you were dead,

06:59.545 --> 07:02.631
the King felt obliged to appoint
a replacement as Bishop.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.471
And who did you appoint?

07:09.763 --> 07:12.308
Your noble friend, Lord Cuthred.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.606
Lord Cuthred is no churchman.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.026
But he is a supporter
of our regime.

07:22.318 --> 07:24.320
Therefore, entitled
to preferment.

07:24.403 --> 07:26.947
And yet, I am not dead.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.867
So you can pronounce
his appointment

07:30.701 --> 07:31.785
invalid.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.079
In some ways, I wish I could.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.540
Lord Cuthred has
already shown an appetite

07:36.623 --> 07:38.709
for fighting for clerical power.

07:38.876 --> 07:41.879
But unfortunately, I'm not yet
strong enough to remove him,

07:41.962 --> 07:43.547
especially in your favor.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.886
Why "especially"?

07:49.136 --> 07:52.306
Everyone knows by now that you
did not die fighting the pagans.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.225
Rather you joined them.
I did not have much choice.

07:55.351 --> 07:57.603
The great defender
of Christendom fighting

07:57.686 --> 08:00.731
not in the name of our Lord,
but in the name of pagan gods.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.984
I am what I have always been.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.488
Christ's warrior on Earth.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.865
And I fight for Him

08:10.657 --> 08:14.536
wherever and for
whomever He chooses.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.664
I believe you, but, alas,
there are many who don't.

08:19.083 --> 08:22.252
And to them you must prove yourself
before I can make you again

08:22.336 --> 08:24.129
prince of our Holy Church.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.700
My people.

08:54.410 --> 08:56.412
My dear people.

08:56.495 --> 08:58.372
I have chosen

08:58.664 --> 09:00.874
this woman to be my new wife.

09:01.125 --> 09:04.086
Her name is Freydis,
and soon you will all know her

09:04.169 --> 09:07.005
as your new Queen of Kattegat.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.685
This is all about the kingship.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.939
He takes a wife,
produces an heir,

09:25.107 --> 09:29.069
and then, in his eyes,
Kattegat is his forever.

09:29.153 --> 09:30.154
A good plan.

09:30.612 --> 09:31.864
Except for one thing.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.490
What "thing"?

09:36.160 --> 09:38.662
He can't produce children.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.707
He is boneless.

10:16.992 --> 10:17.993
Yes.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.163
May the gods smile
on your happiness.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.008
I think it's
your bedtime, Hvitserk.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.679
You know What?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.015
You insult the gods.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.351
What?

10:43.352 --> 10:44.686
The gods love me.

10:45.062 --> 10:46.230
You know that.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.614
I want you.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.367
Mmm.

11:16.969 --> 11:18.178
No.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.138
Don't.

11:21.265 --> 11:22.599
You know I can't.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.351
You can do anything.

11:25.978 --> 11:27.229
Trust me.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.023
<i>Prawns...
Nat.</i>

11:31.441 --> 11:33.151
Ivar, listen to me.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.280
To me, you are a god,

11:37.531 --> 11:39.032
above all men,

11:39.658 --> 11:41.159
above all others.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.370
The gods made you,

11:43.912 --> 11:45.205
<i>Nat.</i>

11:47.874 --> 11:49.167
<i>Nat.</i>

11:52.462 --> 11:54.214
Love me as I love you,

11:55.257 --> 11:57.134
and I will have your child.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.470
I will have your child.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.180
The gods

12:03.098 --> 12:05.475
never had children with humans.

12:05.892 --> 12:06.977
You are wrong.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.771
Odin conceived a son with Rinda.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.316
That son was Vali,

12:13.442 --> 12:14.860
who killed Hod

12:15.193 --> 12:18.405
in the revenge for
the murder of Balder.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.914
You are a god.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.419
A god.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.631
All you have to do

12:38.342 --> 12:39.843
is believe.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.686
By your blood...

12:50.145 --> 12:52.314
I will bear you a child.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.358
A son.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.985
And he too will be a god.

12:58.362 --> 12:59.404
Like you.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.785
And he.
The embodiment of my love.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.871
Will always be by your side,

13:08.538 --> 13:10.374
in times of peace,

13:10.916 --> 13:12.125
of war,

13:12.292 --> 13:14.294
and in time of treachery.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.824
My Lord Heahmund.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.367
Brother in Christ.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.077
Let us embrace,

14:29.161 --> 14:30.620
and thank God for your return.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.000
My Lord Cuthred,

14:36.418 --> 14:38.044
how strange it is

14:38.295 --> 14:40.630
to find you set upon such a...

14:43.758 --> 14:45.427
sacred stage.

14:46.261 --> 14:48.138
I never thought your ambitions

14:48.388 --> 14:50.682
were fixed upon our Holy Church.

14:50.932 --> 14:53.602
God does indeed work
in a mysterious way,

14:53.685 --> 14:54.686
my dear Heahmund.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.772
But like St. Paul
on the road to Damascus,

14:57.856 --> 14:59.524
I, too, was struck by lightning

14:59.608 --> 15:02.360
and saw that my past life
was the way to hell.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.155
That I needed redemption
and the Lord's grace

15:05.947 --> 15:07.449
before it was too late.

15:08.617 --> 15:10.202
I still wonder,

15:11.703 --> 15:14.122
if you would lie down
on a burning griddle

15:14.456 --> 15:15.999
or castrate yourself

15:16.082 --> 15:18.001
or pluck out your eyes

15:18.084 --> 15:19.711
if our Lord requested it,

15:21.129 --> 15:22.380
as I would.

15:22.881 --> 15:26.510
I cannot help but think your
ambitions are more worldly

15:26.593 --> 15:28.637
and less sacred.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.431
Heahmund, you're not exactly
a saint yourself.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.892
The Lord knows my struggles.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.354
I struggle

15:37.562 --> 15:39.981
with the devil in the desert
as our Lord did,

15:41.316 --> 15:43.777
but at least,
my struggles are spiritual.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.449
I know you.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.912
You like being
the prince of the Church

15:54.412 --> 15:56.248
because of these fine robes

15:56.873 --> 15:59.292
and the trappings
of high office,

16:02.504 --> 16:03.797
and the power.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.423
And if I have that power,

16:05.507 --> 16:07.717
do you suppose
I would willingly renounce it?

16:07.801 --> 16:09.928
This is my place.

16:10.345 --> 16:13.098
I am Sherborne's true Bishop,

16:13.181 --> 16:14.474
notyou.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.936
You are a hypocrite

16:19.396 --> 16:21.273
and should step aside

16:22.399 --> 16:24.442
before the Lord finds you out.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.327
On the contrary, I believe I and
others who share my opinion

16:34.411 --> 16:36.413
are doing the Lord's work
and protecting the Church

16:36.496 --> 16:38.248
against the attacks
of our new king.

16:38.707 --> 16:40.041
You have been away.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.128
The death of King Aethelwulf
was a tragedy for Wessex,

16:43.211 --> 16:45.773
and the ascension of his son, a most
dangerous outcome for all of us

16:45.797 --> 16:47.799
who believe in
our holy Catholic Church

16:47.882 --> 16:49.384
and the future of our country.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.220
And so, you

16:53.054 --> 16:55.640
and these others

16:56.349 --> 16:57.976
would seek Alfred's overthrow?

16:58.059 --> 17:01.479
Heahmund, I...
I did not say so.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.860
You did not have to.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.529
Our interview's over.

17:09.613 --> 17:12.198
I'm sorry yourjourney here
was fruitless.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.534
I am Bishop of Sherborne
and will remain so,

17:14.618 --> 17:16.286
by God's good grace.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.041
No crop.

17:24.586 --> 17:25.587
No food.

17:27.672 --> 17:28.965
Nothing to eat.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.388
We won't survive this winter.

17:39.851 --> 17:42.520
<i>From, What do you want?</i>

17:42.979 --> 17:44.731
Everyone here wants to pretend

17:44.814 --> 17:46.608
that Thorgrim's death
was an accident.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.069
It was no accident.
You killed him.

17:49.694 --> 17:50.695
You killed my brother.

17:51.529 --> 17:54.324
And I want to remind you both
that I know the truth.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.785
We didn't kill him.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.245
Get that into your stupid head.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.289
<i>From, you are a good boy,</i>

18:03.083 --> 18:04.709
as was your brother,

18:05.001 --> 18:06.711
as was my son Bul.

18:07.295 --> 18:09.631
But if you ever speak
this way to me again,

18:09.714 --> 18:12.926
this community will
lose another good boy.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.720
You do not care
for this community, Eyvind.

18:15.804 --> 18:16.930
Oh, I care.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.516
I care more than you know,

18:20.392 --> 18:22.227
and more than that fool, Floki.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.238
They all think that I was lying.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.782
That I was lying
to entice you all

18:35.865 --> 18:38.034
to come here
for my own selfish reasons.

18:39.536 --> 18:40.662
Or...

18:41.413 --> 18:42.997
because I am insane.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.626
Perhaps they are right.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.424
What if I never saw the gods?

18:54.843 --> 18:57.011
What if it was all in my head?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.514
What if Ubbe was right?

18:59.764 --> 19:03.643
Perhaps I'm just
a crazy old fool after all.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.980
The gods are not here.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.149
They're not here!

20:03.995 --> 20:05.705
Where have you been?
No.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.543
To Sherborne,

20:11.002 --> 20:12.378
where I used to be Bishop,

20:12.712 --> 20:14.255
to visit my successor.

20:22.722 --> 20:23.932
What is wrong?

20:24.474 --> 20:25.767
They want to kill him.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.144
Who do they want to kill?

20:28.686 --> 20:30.104
They want to kill Alfred.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.816
They want to kill the king.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.339
Princess Elsewith.

20:57.549 --> 20:58.550
My Lady.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.260
Welcome to Wessex.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.888
Yourjourney must have
been long and hard.

21:04.848 --> 21:08.476
May I introduce you to my
elder son, Prince Aethelred.

21:08.726 --> 21:09.894
My Lord.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.230
You must come inside and rest.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.774
And later, you'll meet the king.

21:16.651 --> 21:19.904
You told us that you would
honor King Eobert's pledges.

21:21.364 --> 21:24.450
That you would hand over the
lands that we are entitled to.

21:24.534 --> 21:26.119
If you recall,
I said you'd have to

21:26.202 --> 21:27.996
prove your value to us first.

21:28.079 --> 21:30.081
We don't have to prove anything.

21:30.498 --> 21:33.501
We have the legal right,
here, signed by King Ecbert,

21:34.085 --> 21:35.503
in our presence.

21:39.215 --> 21:42.343
My grandfather had no authority
to grant you any land.

21:42.594 --> 21:45.054
He had already relinquished
the throne to my father,

21:45.138 --> 21:47.599
who was crowned here
a few days before you arrived.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.643
That's all?
It was all just a lie?

21:54.856 --> 21:57.025
But now, you are the king.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.821
So you can sign it over to us,

22:01.905 --> 22:04.365
and you can grant us
those lands right now.

22:05.491 --> 22:09.120
In theory. yes. I could.
What does that mean?

22:09.203 --> 22:11.998
There are important people here
who do not want me to grant lands

22:12.081 --> 22:14.876
to those who, in the past,
have attacked and raided us.

22:14.959 --> 22:18.046
So why would we fight for you when
everything you say is just a lie?

22:18.504 --> 22:20.423
I am not lying.

22:21.132 --> 22:24.218
I'm being more honest with you
than you've any right to expect.

22:24.302 --> 22:26.512
You have thrown yourself
upon my mercy.

22:27.138 --> 22:29.641
So do not presume anymore
upon my charity.

22:29.724 --> 22:32.518
When I can, I will
grant you that land.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.941
In the meantime,
I must go meet my future wife.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.662
Fear not,
he'll be here momentarily.

22:54.666 --> 22:55.959
The King.

23:00.254 --> 23:01.673
There you are.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.842
May I introduce my niece,

23:04.926 --> 23:06.469
Princess Elsewith.

23:06.678 --> 23:07.804
Princess.

23:08.388 --> 23:09.889
Please, sit.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.709
So you are Manuel's daughter?
Yes.

23:37.792 --> 23:40.253
I remember Mannel
before the gates of York.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.338
He was a very brave man.

23:42.505 --> 23:43.840
He saved my life.

23:44.173 --> 23:45.591
I didn't know that.

23:46.801 --> 23:48.886
Ijust heard he died in battle.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.806
When the Northmen
were pressing us back,

23:52.306 --> 23:54.017
he sacrificed himself for us.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.273
But are these not Northmen?

24:01.023 --> 24:02.525
Here at your court?

24:02.608 --> 24:04.360
The sons of
King Ragnar Lothbrok,

24:04.444 --> 24:06.237
the most famous of all Northmen,

24:06.320 --> 24:07.530
on our side,

24:07.905 --> 24:09.407
and prepared to fight for us.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.033
Who is that?

24:11.868 --> 24:13.119
Bjorn Ironside.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.914
I have heard tales of him.

24:16.998 --> 24:18.291
Alfred.

24:20.334 --> 24:21.586
You ought to know,

24:22.128 --> 24:24.464
the Archbishop of Canterbury
summoned a Holy Synod.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.467
To discuss your taxing the church.
What for?

24:27.550 --> 24:29.469
And your harboring of pagans
in the Royal Villa.

24:29.719 --> 24:31.471
You must take
this seriously, Alfred.

24:31.763 --> 24:33.806
They're not the only voices
raised against you.

24:43.608 --> 24:44.859
Come on.

24:49.363 --> 24:50.448
Too slow.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.955
Why do you watch these pagans?

24:58.039 --> 25:01.042
I am curious to see a woman
fighting equally with a man.

25:03.878 --> 25:06.214
I had heard of these
so-called shield-maidens.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.175
I did not believe
they really existed.

25:09.383 --> 25:12.261
It is not proper or decent
for women to fight.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.597
Only these horrid pagans,

25:14.680 --> 25:16.641
worshippers of the devil,
would allow it.

25:18.976 --> 25:22.313
It amazes and disquiets me
that the King of Wessex allows

25:22.396 --> 25:24.732
such people to live
freely at his villa.

25:24.816 --> 25:27.610
Sons of Ragnar, who most
violently put to death

25:27.693 --> 25:29.946
both King Aelle and King Ecbert.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.198
And now they are treated
like honored guests.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.674
We should rest the horses.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.507
You asked to see me?

26:31.883 --> 26:32.884
Yes.

26:33.551 --> 26:35.303
Please, sit.

26:40.641 --> 26:41.851
Some wine?

26:49.609 --> 26:52.236
I think your brother Bjorn
has set his heart against me.

26:52.653 --> 26:53.905
He feels...

26:54.906 --> 26:57.158
Betrayed.
I understand that.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.620
But what can I do?
It was not of my doing.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.872
And for the time being,
it is not easy for me

27:02.955 --> 27:04.415
to grant you those lands again.

27:04.498 --> 27:05.958
Many are against it.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.169
So what are we supposed to do?

27:08.252 --> 27:09.253
A concilium.

27:10.087 --> 27:12.798
You could publicly renounce
your pagan gods,

27:12.882 --> 27:15.551
and be baptized as a Christian.

27:17.762 --> 27:20.056
Can't imagine Bjorn
would ever agree to that.

27:21.223 --> 27:23.392
I'm not talking about Bjorn,

27:24.560 --> 27:25.937
but about you.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.539
You do that for me, Ubbe,

27:45.623 --> 27:47.708
and a part of
my burden is lifted.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.252
Ragnar talked to me
when I was a boy,

27:50.336 --> 27:52.838
and he talked about
your people, my people,

27:52.922 --> 27:54.674
sharing the land.

27:55.633 --> 27:58.052
And I think that,
of all his sons,

27:58.135 --> 27:59.929
you are the closest to him.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.807
He told my grandfather

28:02.890 --> 28:05.559
that he no longer
believed in your gods.

28:07.395 --> 28:08.688
That is not true.

28:08.896 --> 28:11.148
My grandfather
told me everything.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.443
He wanted to prepare me
for times such as this.

28:14.694 --> 28:17.196
And he loved your father.
I know that.

28:17.321 --> 28:20.658
Your father's death broke him,
destroyed him.

28:32.586 --> 28:33.963
I will need time

28:34.505 --> 28:36.298
to think about
what you have told me.

28:55.359 --> 28:56.777
What's wrong with you?

28:57.236 --> 28:58.487
"Wrong," Mother?

28:58.821 --> 29:02.867
Have you nothing to say
to your wife-to-be?

29:03.075 --> 29:06.412
God knows, the poor girl
must feel abandoned,

29:06.620 --> 29:08.456
grievously neglected.

29:09.373 --> 29:10.374
I'm sorry.

29:10.458 --> 29:13.044
Don't apologize to me.

29:15.171 --> 29:18.007
Just speak to her.

29:18.382 --> 29:19.925
Apologize to her.

29:20.009 --> 29:23.471
At least pretend
to be interested.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.808
Mother. you have no idea...
No!

29:28.017 --> 29:30.936
I understand more than
you will ever know.

29:31.062 --> 29:35.524
And I refuse to let you
feel sorry for yourself.

29:35.608 --> 29:38.110
You are a king!

29:41.447 --> 29:43.115
Start behaving like one.

29:59.173 --> 30:00.758
I am with child.

30:01.717 --> 30:02.718
What?

30:03.260 --> 30:04.637
I am with child.

30:15.231 --> 30:17.691
With my...

30:17.775 --> 30:19.276
With your child, Ivar.

30:28.369 --> 30:29.578
I love you.

30:31.831 --> 30:32.998
I love you.

31:22.131 --> 31:24.383
What are you going
to do with her?

31:24.884 --> 31:25.885
Hmm'?

31:26.302 --> 31:27.469
Margrethe?

31:28.345 --> 31:29.638
She's insane.

31:30.681 --> 31:32.558
She is going to kill all of us.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.059
Don't worry, Ivar.

31:34.685 --> 31:36.061
She won't kill you.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.567
Why are you still here?

31:42.902 --> 31:43.903
Hmm'?

31:45.195 --> 31:47.823
What? There's no reason
for you to stay here.

31:48.741 --> 31:52.119
Unless you plan to kill me and
make yourself King of Kattegat.

31:52.202 --> 31:54.163
No, I don't want to do that.

31:54.705 --> 31:56.123
I don't want the...

31:56.916 --> 31:58.042
The mess.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.501
Then why do you stay?

32:02.171 --> 32:03.797
I'm not going to stay.

32:04.340 --> 32:05.591
Believe me.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.135
I have made new plans
on raiding England.

32:08.469 --> 32:10.220
All the others
are raiding there.

32:10.888 --> 32:12.598
I don't want to miss out.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.019
Well, that fits perfectly.

32:17.603 --> 32:20.230
My wife Freydis
is already with child.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.737
Congratulations.

32:28.072 --> 32:29.573
That business doesn't

32:29.907 --> 32:31.617
always work out so well.

33:03.607 --> 33:04.775
Margrethe?

33:24.294 --> 33:25.337
Hi-

33:28.173 --> 33:29.466
I saw her,

33:29.800 --> 33:31.552
the Queen of Kattegat.

33:31.927 --> 33:33.554
Freydis, I saw her.

33:34.555 --> 33:36.724
They say she is with child.
Yes.

33:37.016 --> 33:38.684
I cannot have children.

33:39.727 --> 33:40.894
Not with anyone.

33:40.978 --> 33:43.313
Knowing that has broken my head.

33:43.897 --> 33:47.192
I wanted to be queen,
but Ubbe was a coward!

33:47.276 --> 33:48.569
I don't think so.

33:48.652 --> 33:51.572
I told him not to fight
for Lagertha and Bjorn.

33:51.655 --> 33:55.617
He ignored me, and betrayed me
with that bitch, Torvi.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.082
But you are kind.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.584
Listen...
You listen.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.461
Ivar is not kind.

34:06.045 --> 34:07.629
He is not kind to you.

34:08.464 --> 34:10.591
In the end, he will kill you.

34:11.759 --> 34:14.845
So the only choice, my love,
is to kill him first.

34:15.345 --> 34:17.097
You are not a coward, are you?

34:17.681 --> 34:18.682
No.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.059
I thought not.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.687
So, if you kill Ivar,

34:24.229 --> 34:25.981
then I will be queen,

34:26.440 --> 34:28.275
and everything
will be all right.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.070
Don't let me down.

34:31.320 --> 34:32.863
You have to do it.

34:33.614 --> 34:35.741
And don't think I'm mad.
I'm not mad.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.118
No, no, no,
you're not mad. Here.

34:39.578 --> 34:43.207
You are just...
You're just tired.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.251
You need to rest.

34:46.627 --> 34:49.546
What is wrong with me?
Nothing's wrong with you.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.427
Sleep, sweet Margrethe.

34:57.346 --> 34:58.555
I'll see you soon.

35:03.936 --> 35:05.437
<i>Sleep</i>

35:05.521 --> 35:07.773
<i>Sleep, my son</i>

35:08.065 --> 35:11.443
<i>The seals are asleep in the sea</i>

35:12.027 --> 35:16.490
<i>The swan on the breaker</i>

35:16.573 --> 35:19.827
<i>Seagull on the hill</i>

35:20.327 --> 35:27.000
<i>The cod in the deep water</i>

36:33.609 --> 36:35.110
I'm sorry I've neglected you.

36:35.569 --> 36:38.655
Sire, please, don't
concern yourself with me.

36:38.906 --> 36:41.491
It is my fault that I have not
found the time to talk to you,

36:41.575 --> 36:42.659
get to know you better.

36:44.161 --> 36:45.537
We're supposed to be married.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.789
Do you want to marry me?

36:47.873 --> 36:50.417
I... I hardly know.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.629
Look, I promise
I will get to know you better,

36:54.213 --> 36:56.256
but for the moment...
I know.

36:57.007 --> 36:59.218
You have more
important things to do.

37:01.678 --> 37:03.222
I'll see you later.

37:04.598 --> 37:05.891
Sire.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.857
He is not kind.
Leave me alone.

37:14.316 --> 37:15.943
I can have my own thoughts.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.153
If you insist.

37:38.215 --> 37:39.800
You're Bjorn Ironside.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.094
Lam.

37:42.636 --> 37:43.971
Go away.

37:44.346 --> 37:45.764
If you want.

38:14.459 --> 38:15.836
What are you doing?

38:47.117 --> 38:48.577
And you saw them kissing?

38:48.910 --> 38:50.120
Yes, Your Grace.

38:50.412 --> 38:53.457
And then, fornicating together?

38:53.540 --> 38:54.791
Yes, Your Grace.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.002
Making the beast with two backs.

38:58.211 --> 38:59.504
Poor Heahmund.

39:00.464 --> 39:02.883
He was a man who could never
control his passions,

39:03.342 --> 39:05.218
and now, his passions
will destroy him.

39:07.137 --> 39:09.514
But first, for the love I owe
him, I will write to him.

39:10.474 --> 39:12.476
Better for all of us
he understands that

39:13.310 --> 39:15.520
he can never again
be prince of the Church.

39:41.296 --> 39:42.547
I shouldn't be here.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.216
Why not?

39:44.716 --> 39:46.259
God will punish me.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.346
My gods won't punish you.

40:12.702 --> 40:14.371
I'm a virgin.

40:37.227 --> 40:38.436
Who are you?

40:41.064 --> 40:42.691
Why don't you go away?

41:02.794 --> 41:04.296
Don't kill me.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.464
<i>Hove Nat.</i>

41:07.090 --> 41:10.260
It's not worth killing me,
I'm harmless!

41:10.760 --> 41:12.888
I married him out of regret.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.194
<i>To my Lord Heahmund,
brother in Christ,</i>

41:27.611 --> 41:30.363
<i>I write this day
with a most heavy heart,</i>

41:30.697 --> 41:33.283
<i>having indisputable proof that,</i>

41:33.366 --> 41:36.745
<i>rather than observe your vows
of celibacy, you fornicate,</i>

41:36.828 --> 41:38.246
<i>almost daily.</i>

41:39.247 --> 41:43.376
<i>And not with Christian women, but,
so it appears, with a pagan woman.</i>

41:43.960 --> 41:46.129
<i>Thus, your sins are multiplied.</i>

41:46.296 --> 41:49.883
<i>And your king and master
must learn the truth.</i>

41:50.217 --> 41:51.343
<i>Cuthred.</i>

42:02.520 --> 42:05.232
HEAHMUND1Hyah! Hyah!

42:12.614 --> 42:13.949
My Lord Heahmund.

42:15.242 --> 42:16.826
What has brought you here?

42:22.040 --> 42:24.876
You know, we must show respect

42:24.960 --> 42:27.128
in this most sacred
of all places.

42:27.337 --> 42:30.715
You have forced me
to it, Lord Cuthred.

42:31.174 --> 42:34.177
You have forced me
by your hypocrisy,

42:34.469 --> 42:37.472
by your danger to my king.

42:37.555 --> 42:40.392
Even so, Heahmund, draw back.

42:40.767 --> 42:43.270
Do not commit a crime
in the eyes of the Lord.

42:43.478 --> 42:44.688
Do not damn yourself.

42:44.771 --> 42:48.441
You are a most
troublesome priest.

42:50.694 --> 42:52.195
A hollow man.

42:52.654 --> 42:55.490
And you have no true faith.

43:03.707 --> 43:04.916
Damn you!

43:05.000 --> 43:06.543
Damn you to hell!

43:25.103 --> 43:26.354
Heahmund,

43:26.438 --> 43:29.816
this is hell.
The world will end.

43:29.899 --> 43:32.402
No, just your world.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.025
Amen.
