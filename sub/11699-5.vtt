WEBVTT

00:03.228 --> 00:06.386
I got to say nothing
like a day at the beach...

00:06.387 --> 00:08.392
Even when you're nowhere near the beach.

00:09.675 --> 00:11.636
Oh, hey, will you do my back?

00:11.637 --> 00:12.928
Sure.

00:12.929 --> 00:14.818
And after that, maybe I can do your front.

00:16.621 --> 00:18.203
You wouldn't want to be uneven.

00:19.496 --> 00:20.607
Ben, I warned you.

00:20.608 --> 00:23.031
One pseudo-flirty comment
and I'm out of here.

00:24.169 --> 00:25.635
What?

00:25.636 --> 00:26.565
No, I just realized

00:26.566 --> 00:28.079
that I have absolutely nothing to say.

00:29.033 --> 00:30.087
<i>Mine!</i>

00:31.631 --> 00:33.378
Dude, that was mine.

00:33.379 --> 00:34.802
You want to know how I know.

00:34.803 --> 00:36.200
Because I just said "mine."

00:36.700 --> 00:38.646
Dude, I'm a professional athlete.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.017
They're all mine.

00:41.482 --> 00:43.311
Are you sure we have
permission to be up here?

00:43.312 --> 00:44.569
Yup, totally sure.

00:44.570 --> 00:45.824
Completely approved.

00:45.825 --> 00:47.228
Ben Wheeler!

00:47.547 --> 00:49.189
What are you doing up here on the roof?

00:49.190 --> 00:51.039
Especially since I just told you

00:51.040 --> 00:52.479
that you couldn't be up here...

00:52.480 --> 00:53.518
On the roof.

00:54.746 --> 00:56.423
Okay, maybe not totally approved.

00:58.419 --> 01:01.226
As board president, it
is my duty to remind you

01:01.227 --> 01:02.429
that rules are rules.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.611
And following the rules,
well, that's a rule.

01:04.613 --> 01:06.563
So pack up your flip-flops
and flap on out of here

01:06.564 --> 01:08.433
because tar beach is officially closed.

01:08.434 --> 01:09.617
Sondra, please.

01:09.618 --> 01:11.119
We're not hurting anyone.

01:14.737 --> 01:16.083
<i>Heads up!</i>

01:16.475 --> 01:17.175
I spiked it!

01:17.550 --> 01:19.153
Did you see that? Here, chest bump me.

01:19.633 --> 01:20.501
Ooh.

01:21.314 --> 01:23.004
You got to bend down a little.

01:25.015 --> 01:26.276
- Yeah, that's good.
- Yeah.

01:28.543 --> 01:31.393
<i>* it's amazing how the unexpected *</i>

01:31.394 --> 01:34.255
<i>* can take your life
and change direction. *</i>

01:38.889 --> 01:43.110
and a six-pack for your six pack.

01:44.828 --> 01:46.157
I'm telling you, she's the worst thing

01:46.158 --> 01:47.620
that's ever happened to this building.

01:47.621 --> 01:48.823
Hey, if you got something to say to me,

01:48.824 --> 01:50.005
say it to my face.

01:50.774 --> 01:52.368
Mom, sondra.

01:52.369 --> 01:53.623
She's at it again.

01:53.624 --> 01:55.310
She closed down tar beach.

01:55.311 --> 01:56.875
She doesn't think we're responsible enough

01:56.876 --> 01:59.202
and that we're not respectful
of other people's property.

02:02.620 --> 02:05.138
Thanks for letting us borrow
your umbrella, Mrs. Wheeler.

02:06.998 --> 02:09.173
Thanks for letting me
borrow your umbrella, honey.

02:10.454 --> 02:11.631
Hey, Brad, here's a little tip

02:11.632 --> 02:12.965
if you're hanging out with the wheelers.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.379
Uh, your stuff is their stuff

02:14.380 --> 02:17.208
so expect it to be
broken, stolen, or peed on.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.507
You know what?

02:19.508 --> 02:21.437
I don't care if sondra is board president.

02:21.438 --> 02:22.731
This is America. We don't put up

02:22.732 --> 02:24.234
with petty dictators.

02:24.235 --> 02:26.409
There will be mutiny in the elevators,

02:26.410 --> 02:28.296
revolution in the hallways.

02:28.297 --> 02:30.501
Give me tar beach or give me death!

02:32.600 --> 02:35.528
Uh, before you start loading your musket,

02:35.529 --> 02:36.919
you should probably know

02:37.997 --> 02:39.477
if you want to make a change to the rules,

02:39.478 --> 02:41.292
just hold an election and run against her.

02:42.513 --> 02:44.552
Oh my God, that's such a good idea.

02:45.441 --> 02:46.956
President Wheeler.

02:46.957 --> 02:48.631
Is it too soon to get the t-shirts made?

02:49.761 --> 02:51.507
Honey, you are totally gonna win.

02:51.508 --> 02:53.045
- You really think so?
- Oh God, no.

02:54.724 --> 02:56.757
Everybody in this building hates you.

02:56.758 --> 02:58.966
I mean, I'm your mother
and I wouldn't vote for you.

03:00.082 --> 03:01.216
That's not tr...

03:01.981 --> 03:04.635
okay, it's kind of hard to argue the facts.

03:05.323 --> 03:07.445
But I just need to find a
candidate to run in my place.

03:07.446 --> 03:10.063
- Someone popular, but fun...
- Oh my God, hello.

03:11.919 --> 03:13.674
Charismatic and convincing.

03:13.675 --> 03:15.323
Have you read my online profile?

03:17.023 --> 03:19.469
Previous experience, not a bad idea.

03:19.470 --> 03:22.375
President of my high school
chess club and the mathletes.

03:23.634 --> 03:26.022
Dude, we were just like the athletes...

03:27.130 --> 03:28.874
Except we got beat up a lot.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.420
Fine, fine. You're in.

03:31.421 --> 03:32.580
Yes!

03:33.122 --> 03:35.146
Something has to be
done about this building.

03:36.244 --> 03:38.581
My first constituent complaint.

03:39.045 --> 03:40.598
How may I help you, kind sir?

03:41.387 --> 03:42.770
There's a thief among us.

03:42.771 --> 03:44.441
Someone keeps stealing
my laundry detergent.

03:44.442 --> 03:46.414
Yeah, don't care.

03:46.415 --> 03:47.946
Ooh, ooh. Here, okay,

03:47.947 --> 03:50.731
we should use the same
slogan I used in mathletes.

03:51.325 --> 03:53.413
"The competition better fear him.

03:53.790 --> 03:56.609
He's like a human pythagorean theorem."

03:57.486 --> 03:58.606
Yeah.

03:59.922 --> 04:02.113
Yeah, I can see why you got beat up a lot.

04:04.107 --> 04:06.237
Hold on a second. I am checking my computer

04:06.238 --> 04:08.815
right now.

04:11.906 --> 04:13.571
Sorry, man, I am totally booked up.

04:13.572 --> 04:15.863
I'll call you when I'm back
in the country. Bye-bye!

04:17.172 --> 04:18.946
- And hello.
- Hi.

04:19.406 --> 04:21.406
Normally when I'm alone
I just sit at the bar,

04:21.406 --> 04:23.650
but here you are and here I am, so...

04:23.973 --> 04:25.796
So why not be alone together, right?

04:25.797 --> 04:26.931
Right.

04:26.932 --> 04:29.781
And now, what should I order?

04:29.782 --> 04:31.330
- What are you having?
- I haven't decided yet.

04:31.331 --> 04:33.284
But I'm definitely thinking something...

04:34.036 --> 04:35.520
Hot.

04:37.234 --> 04:39.098
Good idea. Soup.

04:41.088 --> 04:42.972
I hope I'm not being too forward,

04:42.973 --> 04:45.991
but you have beautiful eyes.

04:47.124 --> 04:48.207
Okay.

04:48.208 --> 04:49.227
Um...

04:49.667 --> 04:50.759
Maybe a little forward,

04:50.760 --> 04:52.434
but... thanks!

04:52.435 --> 04:55.850
Yours are... right where they should be.

04:57.115 --> 04:59.178
And they are looking
forward to seeing things

04:59.179 --> 05:00.983
that they shouldn't.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.328
I'm sorry. Are you flirting with me?

05:06.329 --> 05:07.494
No, no.

05:07.842 --> 05:09.625
I am full-on hitting on you.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.275
Oh, my God. Why would you do that?

05:13.276 --> 05:15.263
You're here, you're
pretty, I'm bored. Pick one.

05:16.769 --> 05:18.340
Besides, you started it.

05:18.341 --> 05:20.418
And I am finishing it.

05:27.314 --> 05:28.684
It's finished.

05:31.911 --> 05:33.375
Okay, Tucker.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.537
You just need to be capable

05:34.538 --> 05:35.885
but still a man of the people.

05:35.886 --> 05:37.854
Sincere but smooth.

05:37.855 --> 05:41.569
Dude, I am so smooth lotion puts me on.

05:43.244 --> 05:44.714
I got this.

05:44.715 --> 05:46.476
Hello! Tucker Dobbs.

05:46.477 --> 05:48.284
4d. Running for board president.

05:48.285 --> 05:50.173
I dot believe we've had the
pleasure of meeting before.

05:53.317 --> 05:55.347
Mm, now I remember.

05:56.085 --> 05:57.960
Hey, but to be fair,
you look a lot different

05:57.961 --> 05:59.430
with the lights on.

06:00.087 --> 06:01.659
Hope we still have your vote!

06:02.113 --> 06:03.680
Tucker, what is the matter with you?

06:03.681 --> 06:05.400
What? Look, I'm sorry.

06:05.401 --> 06:06.652
It was dark.

06:06.653 --> 06:08.467
Promises were made, and obviously,

06:08.468 --> 06:10.087
some of them were broken.

06:10.088 --> 06:11.375
Okay, well, shake it off.

06:11.376 --> 06:12.806
That's just one vote.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.387
There you go, Ms. proctor.

06:14.388 --> 06:16.630
Now just let me know if there's
anything else you need, okay?

06:18.407 --> 06:19.717
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

06:20.490 --> 06:22.576
You want to replace me with Danny?

06:22.577 --> 06:23.643
How could you?

06:23.644 --> 06:25.559
No, I was thinking Mrs. proctor.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.650
But Danny's way better.

06:28.048 --> 06:30.073
Danny, how do you feel
about a career in politics?

06:30.578 --> 06:32.238
I don't know. I already have a job.

06:34.093 --> 06:35.493
Now, Emma,

06:35.494 --> 06:37.424
you know that grandma is only allowed

06:37.425 --> 06:40.053
to buy one item online per day.

06:40.537 --> 06:42.807
Which, sadly, she's already done.

06:43.247 --> 06:47.287
So I'm gonna need you to click right there.

06:48.541 --> 06:51.324
Oh! Next-day shipping?

06:51.325 --> 06:54.105
Oh, Emma, you spoil me.

06:54.106 --> 06:56.100
Knock, knock. Danny, you are
not going to believe what...

06:56.101 --> 06:57.548
oh! Mrs. Wheeler.

06:57.958 --> 06:59.258
I'm sorry, I was just...
I didn't mean to...

06:59.259 --> 07:01.805
I was... hi!

07:03.281 --> 07:05.551
Oh, Riley! I didn't... I was...

07:05.552 --> 07:07.259
I didn't mean to... spit it out.

07:09.970 --> 07:10.931
Okay...

07:11.917 --> 07:13.043
Mrs. Wheeler,

07:13.593 --> 07:15.832
I'm so sorry to have to be
the one to tell you this,

07:15.833 --> 07:19.238
but your boyfriend kind of just hit on me.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.824
Oh, can you blame him?

07:20.825 --> 07:22.601
I wanted to hit you a bunch of times.

07:25.311 --> 07:26.836
Not hit me.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.674
Hit on me.

07:28.675 --> 07:31.108
Oh, honey, you probably misunderstood him.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.916
Why would he want the dinghy

07:32.917 --> 07:34.671
when he's already got the yacht?

07:38.464 --> 07:39.790
Hey, babe, ready to roll?

07:39.791 --> 07:42.190
- Oh, hey, Brad.
- Aah! Hi. Riley.

07:42.786 --> 07:44.387
I did not see you there.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.559
Go ahead. Ask him.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.913
Ask me what?

07:48.914 --> 07:50.543
Okay. All right. Fine.

07:50.544 --> 07:53.131
Brad, Riley has got this crazy idea

07:53.132 --> 07:54.855
that you hit on her.

07:54.856 --> 07:57.708
What? I would never do that to you.

07:58.061 --> 08:01.742
See? I know it's been a while
since you had a boyfriend,

08:01.743 --> 08:05.242
but... well, that's really
all I have to say about that.

08:07.887 --> 08:09.526
Something hot.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.516
Beautiful eyes.

08:12.517 --> 08:13.831
Any of this coming back to you?

08:14.886 --> 08:17.377
Oh, okay.

08:17.378 --> 08:18.902
I know what happened.

08:18.903 --> 08:21.446
You must have run into my brother, tad.

08:21.865 --> 08:23.113
We're twins.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.335
Really, that's...

08:28.777 --> 08:31.547
I had no idea you had a twin brother.

08:31.548 --> 08:34.611
That actually kind of makes sense now.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.514
Well, if that makes sense,

08:37.515 --> 08:39.827
then your B.S. Meter is on the Fritz.

08:39.828 --> 08:42.121
Because that just pinged off the charts.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.063
Bonnie, I swear. You have to believe me.

08:45.064 --> 08:46.164
Oh, oh, I will.

08:46.165 --> 08:47.604
Once you introduce me.

08:47.605 --> 08:48.972
And if I'm not seeing double,

08:48.973 --> 08:50.421
you're gonna be single.

08:50.422 --> 08:52.462
Well, actually tad is pretty...

08:52.463 --> 08:53.890
I'll see what I can do.

08:53.891 --> 08:55.403
Yeah, good. All right, Riley.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.087
Cancel your plans. It looks like you and I

08:57.088 --> 08:58.652
are going on a double date tonight.

08:58.653 --> 08:59.727
Oh, actually, tonight I was going to...

09:00.245 --> 09:01.437
I'll be there.

09:03.815 --> 09:04.987
<i>Go rangers!</i>

09:06.198 --> 09:07.578
Way to go, Danny!

09:08.015 --> 09:09.648
Yes, I think that's one more vote

09:09.649 --> 09:12.071
for Danny Wheeler... man, this is easy.

09:12.072 --> 09:13.400
I should run for real president.

09:14.980 --> 09:16.908
Well, well, well.

09:17.681 --> 09:19.552
If it isn't small, medium, and large.

09:24.696 --> 09:25.976
Hello, sondra.

09:25.977 --> 09:27.491
Hey, did you lose something?

09:27.492 --> 09:29.213
Like... an election?

09:32.048 --> 09:33.723
I just came by to say good-bye.

09:33.724 --> 09:34.918
Good-bye, Ben.

09:35.563 --> 09:36.772
Oh, are you moving out?

09:36.773 --> 09:38.616
- 'Cause that would solve a ton of problems.
- Right.

09:38.617 --> 09:40.236
- Totally.
- Nope!

09:40.237 --> 09:41.695
You are!

09:42.149 --> 09:43.462
You see this?

09:43.463 --> 09:46.300
It's a record of every violation

09:46.301 --> 09:47.595
you've ever committed.

09:48.748 --> 09:50.693
- She's even got
pictures. - Mm-hmm.

09:50.694 --> 09:53.305
Oh, wow. I totally forgot about that night.

09:53.754 --> 09:56.118
I guess I can't run for real president now.

09:58.458 --> 09:59.626
And if you don't win,

10:00.009 --> 10:01.371
which you won't,

10:01.372 --> 10:02.960
I'm having you evicted.

10:03.281 --> 10:04.796
And this sign

10:04.797 --> 10:06.477
is going up first thing Monday morning.

10:07.310 --> 10:09.033
You messed with the wrong girl, Ben.

10:09.394 --> 10:10.556
The wrong girl.

10:14.595 --> 10:15.730
Evicted?

10:16.815 --> 10:17.730
Hey.

10:17.731 --> 10:18.948
If she wants to play dirty,

10:18.949 --> 10:20.905
then we will play dirty.

10:22.358 --> 10:24.226
But we should probably get
some boxes just in case.

10:28.137 --> 10:30.759
But laundry room security
isn't my only priority.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.331
I also plan on doing something
about the air conditioning.

10:33.332 --> 10:35.008
'Cause we know it sure can get hot.

10:35.408 --> 10:37.744
At least... I know I am.

10:38.997 --> 10:40.738
Whoo!

10:42.121 --> 10:43.577
That's better.

10:44.071 --> 10:45.584
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

10:45.585 --> 10:47.200
<i>- Real classy.</i>

10:47.617 --> 10:48.819
Oh, please.

10:48.820 --> 10:50.881
I've seen you take your pants off for $1.

10:52.697 --> 10:54.809
So was it a yes?

10:54.810 --> 10:56.750
That was an "oh, yes."

10:56.751 --> 10:58.393
Which means

10:58.394 --> 10:59.986
we could actually win this thing.

10:59.987 --> 11:01.611
It all comes down to one deciding vote.

11:02.693 --> 11:04.117
Old lady Curtis.

11:04.676 --> 11:06.805
She's an
80-year-old shut-in.

11:06.806 --> 11:09.188
How you gonna bribe her, "ab" Lincoln?

11:10.763 --> 11:12.553
More tea, dear?

11:12.554 --> 11:14.135
Oh, yes, ma'am.

11:14.136 --> 11:15.514
I love tea.

11:20.102 --> 11:21.373
Oops.

11:27.985 --> 11:30.222
Mrs. Wheeler, what are you doing?

11:30.223 --> 11:32.282
Oh, I'm just loosening
up my drink-throwing arm.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.188
I haven't thrown a drink

11:34.189 --> 11:35.791
in a man's face since principal Roberts

11:35.792 --> 11:37.203
told me I looked pregnant.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.411
I mean, I was, but he didn't know it.

11:44.540 --> 11:46.284
I think you're going to feel pretty silly

11:46.285 --> 11:47.936
when two very handsome men

11:47.937 --> 11:49.395
come walking in that door.

11:49.396 --> 11:51.194
Well, after I break up with Brad,

11:51.195 --> 11:52.712
maybe we can date them.

11:54.461 --> 11:56.420
Yeah I just can't believe
that he would do this to me.

11:56.994 --> 11:59.544
Me! I'm an angel!

12:01.064 --> 12:02.675
Hey, ladies! Sorry I'm late.

12:02.676 --> 12:04.181
- My brother is...
- Oh, no no no.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.201
Let me guess... medical emergency?

12:06.202 --> 12:07.585
Called away suddenly?

12:07.586 --> 12:09.677
Stopped at the excuse
store, but they were closed?

12:10.477 --> 12:12.764
No no no. No no. Tad is just
running a few minutes behind.

12:12.765 --> 12:15.429
And here he is now. He needs cab fare.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.711
Typical tad. I will be right back.

12:17.712 --> 12:19.047
Oh, that tad.

12:22.469 --> 12:24.021
Okay, so...

12:24.328 --> 12:25.806
I know what you're thinking.

12:25.807 --> 12:28.376
But why would he come all the way down here

12:28.377 --> 12:29.884
just to turn around and leave?

12:30.238 --> 12:32.071
You're right, Riley.

12:32.072 --> 12:34.342
Maybe he'll ride back in on a unicorn.

12:35.460 --> 12:37.001
Hey, sorry I'm late.

12:37.002 --> 12:39.123
And so nice to see you again.

12:39.124 --> 12:40.569
And you must be Bonnie.

12:40.570 --> 12:42.590
Brad will not stop talking about you.

12:42.591 --> 12:44.461
Hey, sorry about that whole
lunch thing... small world.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.648
Glasses?

12:48.782 --> 12:49.952
Really?

12:49.953 --> 12:51.311
Glasses.

12:52.031 --> 12:53.784
Is that the best you could do?

12:54.483 --> 12:56.551
I mean, come on. Hey, everybody.

12:56.552 --> 12:58.687
Have you met my cousin Connie?

12:58.688 --> 13:00.411
Oh, hello, everybody!

13:00.412 --> 13:01.540
Hello!

13:03.036 --> 13:04.279
Okay, so...

13:04.664 --> 13:06.140
Not to cause any trouble here,

13:06.141 --> 13:08.322
but where exactly is your brother?

13:08.323 --> 13:09.648
Uh, oh, he got a call.

13:09.649 --> 13:11.079
He said he'd be like two seconds.

13:11.663 --> 13:12.965
Let me just go and grab him.

13:15.710 --> 13:17.761
- He seems nice.
- Does he?

13:17.762 --> 13:18.958
Does he really?

13:20.394 --> 13:21.980
I'm really sorry about the cup.

13:22.556 --> 13:25.465
Oh... that's okay, dear.

13:26.625 --> 13:30.045
What does "priceless" really mean, anyway?

13:31.757 --> 13:33.881
You know, one of the other benefits

13:33.882 --> 13:35.440
of having a tall president...

13:35.441 --> 13:38.158
there's always someone
available to change light bulbs.

13:38.159 --> 13:40.721
That's how my first husband died.

13:40.722 --> 13:41.957
Changing a light bulb?

13:41.958 --> 13:43.342
No. Interrupting me

13:43.343 --> 13:45.536
while I was having a conversation.

13:47.286 --> 13:49.540
Mrs. Curtis, here's the truth.

13:49.541 --> 13:50.928
Look, we don't know if we can do this,

13:50.929 --> 13:52.745
but we have to do something to stop sondra.

13:53.096 --> 13:54.221
If we don't win this,

13:54.222 --> 13:55.598
she's going to evict the three of us

13:55.599 --> 13:57.139
and my beautiful little girl.

13:57.910 --> 13:59.664
You wouldn't want that, would you?

13:59.665 --> 14:02.363
Actually, I don't care
one way or the other.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.864
But I do hate that sondra.

14:06.197 --> 14:08.168
That voice makes me grateful

14:08.169 --> 14:10.889
my hearing aid has volume control.

14:12.189 --> 14:13.414
You have my vote.

14:13.847 --> 14:15.037
Really?

14:15.038 --> 14:17.024
That's great! Thank you.

14:17.025 --> 14:19.334
That's okay. It could happen to anyone.

14:19.335 --> 14:21.922
Here, let me...

14:23.000 --> 14:29.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

14:36.005 --> 14:37.376
So...

14:37.377 --> 14:39.067
Can we still count on your vote?

14:39.693 --> 14:43.719
If you can get the big one
to stop moving around, sure.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.045
Really?!

14:45.046 --> 14:46.599
Oh, my God. Thank you!

14:47.463 --> 14:48.787
Oh! Oh.

14:50.887 --> 14:52.178
Mrs. Curtis?

14:53.415 --> 14:54.550
Mrs. Curtis?

15:01.487 --> 15:04.216
Dude! How hard did you hug her?

15:09.889 --> 15:12.056
Well, Riley, if you're keeping score,

15:12.057 --> 15:14.787
we have Brad with four appearances

15:14.788 --> 15:16.737
and tad with only two.

15:17.912 --> 15:21.216
I'm expecting a visit
from tad any moment now.

15:22.420 --> 15:24.596
I am so sorry, bon-bon.

15:24.597 --> 15:26.078
I don't think I've ever
gotten so many phone calls

15:26.079 --> 15:27.144
in my entire life.

15:27.514 --> 15:29.890
And it's Brad with five!

15:30.853 --> 15:33.728
All right, you seem to be
the star of this little show.

15:34.751 --> 15:36.487
Where is tad?

15:36.488 --> 15:38.926
Well, Brad, the last we heard

15:38.927 --> 15:40.875
tad's still stuck in the bathroom stall.

15:40.876 --> 15:42.456
Really, they still haven't gotten him out?

15:42.944 --> 15:44.320
I should probably go and check on him.

15:44.321 --> 15:45.546
Yeah, yeah.

15:45.924 --> 15:48.583
Okay, either he's the worst liar

15:48.584 --> 15:50.381
I have ever met, or he thinks

15:50.382 --> 15:52.853
I am the dumbest woman
on the face of the planet.

15:53.609 --> 15:55.509
I mean, it could be a combination.

15:59.908 --> 16:01.757
Oh, my God. You're not gonna
believe what just happened.

16:01.758 --> 16:02.916
Oh, you got that right.

16:03.306 --> 16:04.876
I was finally able to open the stall,

16:04.877 --> 16:06.411
but then the door hit
Brad right in the nose.

16:06.412 --> 16:07.994
There's blood everywhere!

16:07.995 --> 16:09.389
- What?!
- Oh, my God. Really?

16:09.390 --> 16:10.761
- Is he okay?
- I think so.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.735
- I just need some ice.
- Oh, yeah, here.

16:12.736 --> 16:14.042
Here take mine.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.983
You know, I'm so sorry, Mrs. Wheeler.

16:17.984 --> 16:19.280
You were right.

16:19.281 --> 16:22.097
You are just the lowest of the low.

16:22.098 --> 16:23.517
You know, the kind of guy who thinks he can

16:23.518 --> 16:25.221
lie his way out of anything
because you look like

16:25.222 --> 16:27.991
a second-rate department store mannequin.

16:29.163 --> 16:30.535
Well, you know what...

16:30.536 --> 16:33.732
"Brad," "tad, "or any other
word that rhymes with "cad"...

16:33.733 --> 16:36.498
you can just crawl back
to your outlet mall.

16:36.499 --> 16:38.031
'Cause we ain't buying what you're selling.

16:40.182 --> 16:42.510
- Anything to add?
- Nope.

16:42.912 --> 16:44.432
Think you about covered it.

16:44.433 --> 16:45.777
Ooh, wait.

16:49.973 --> 16:51.720
Like riding a bike, you know?

16:54.436 --> 16:56.119
Wait wait wait wait... Bonnie...

16:56.120 --> 16:57.942
Riley, I can explain!

16:57.943 --> 16:59.607
Where... where are they going?

17:00.256 --> 17:02.122
And what did you do?

17:03.224 --> 17:04.662
Ugh, I swear!

17:04.663 --> 17:06.198
This purse is just gonna be the end...

17:08.665 --> 17:10.983
Brad?

17:12.948 --> 17:14.214
Tad?

17:15.046 --> 17:17.575
So do you guys want one big apology,

17:17.576 --> 17:18.912
or two little ones?

17:19.961 --> 17:22.525
Maybe if we... Or we could just...

17:22.526 --> 17:23.759
No, Ben, that's illegal.

17:25.824 --> 17:27.288
Ben, it's over.

17:27.289 --> 17:29.527
We are never gonna be
winning any hearts and minds

17:29.528 --> 17:32.211
once people find out that
we killed Mrs. Curtis.

17:33.321 --> 17:35.145
Tucker, man, it's gonna be fine.

17:35.146 --> 17:37.026
You weren't the one who
had to climb on top of her

17:37.027 --> 17:38.443
and give her cpr!

17:40.089 --> 17:41.745
It is never going to be fine.

17:41.746 --> 17:43.397
I am never going to be fine.

17:45.621 --> 17:47.121
Her teeth came out.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.442
Men.

17:51.443 --> 17:53.585
I can't believe I made two of you.

17:53.586 --> 17:54.981
I disgust myself.

17:56.816 --> 17:58.572
You think you can walk all over us.

17:59.063 --> 18:00.072
Well, guess what...

18:00.073 --> 18:01.421
I am not a floor.

18:01.726 --> 18:03.017
But if I was a floor,

18:03.018 --> 18:05.457
I would be covered in
beautiful shag carpeting.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.952
Sure, I might have some traffic patterns

18:08.953 --> 18:10.753
and a bald spot near the floor lamp.

18:10.754 --> 18:12.108
But my point is...

18:12.109 --> 18:13.380
do you actually even have a point?

18:13.381 --> 18:15.173
No, I am so upset, I have no idea

18:15.174 --> 18:16.218
where I'm going with this.

18:18.386 --> 18:19.717
Mrs. Wheeler.

18:19.718 --> 18:21.355
I didn't... I was...

18:21.356 --> 18:22.458
I didn't mean to...

18:22.846 --> 18:24.032
hi!

18:25.502 --> 18:28.199
Okay, boys, look at this face, huh?

18:28.200 --> 18:30.893
This is the face of a true friend.

18:31.289 --> 18:33.097
She threw a $15 cocktail

18:33.098 --> 18:33.991
into a man's face.

18:34.519 --> 18:38.099
For me. $15.

18:39.728 --> 18:41.862
So, remember when I said

18:41.863 --> 18:43.943
that your boyfriend kind of hit on me?

18:43.944 --> 18:46.166
- Yeah.
- Well, it turns out he didn't.

18:47.630 --> 18:50.612
And his brother tad really does exist.

18:50.613 --> 18:52.319
Oh, why are you trying to cover up for that

18:52.320 --> 18:55.649
no-good, gorgeous man that
I dumped because of you?

18:57.146 --> 18:59.266
I can't believe God made two of them.

18:59.267 --> 19:00.752
Oh! All right.

19:02.423 --> 19:03.835
Oh, my God. I've gotta go.

19:03.836 --> 19:05.064
You are dead to me.

19:07.348 --> 19:08.559
- Oh, hey, mom.
- Hi, honey.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.183
Hey, guys, it worked!

19:10.184 --> 19:11.360
I set up a surveillance camera,

19:11.361 --> 19:12.864
and I caught the detergent thief.

19:13.732 --> 19:15.020
Wow, that's great.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.028
Hey, remind me to put that in today's list

19:17.029 --> 19:18.672
of amazing accomplishments...

19:18.673 --> 19:20.351
right after "we're getting evicted"

19:20.352 --> 19:21.942
and "I kissed a dead woman."

19:24.088 --> 19:25.333
Evicted?

19:25.334 --> 19:26.774
Oh, we'll see about that.

19:28.122 --> 19:29.455
<i>Wait for it.</i>

19:29.825 --> 19:31.474
Wait for it.

19:32.731 --> 19:33.934
<i>There! There.</i>

19:33.935 --> 19:35.354
Gotcha.

19:35.355 --> 19:36.521
Now what have you got to say, huh?

19:37.070 --> 19:39.561
Okay, so maybe I borrowed a few drops

19:39.562 --> 19:41.267
of your precious detergent.

19:41.268 --> 19:42.737
It is so not a big deal.

19:42.738 --> 19:44.803
Everyone does it. Everyone!

19:45.401 --> 19:47.989
Ho, ho! Then I guess you wouldn't mind me

19:47.990 --> 19:50.217
emailing this video to
everyone in the building.

19:50.544 --> 19:52.156
You wouldn't dare.

19:53.082 --> 19:54.562
Oh, wouldn't I?

19:55.015 --> 19:56.660
Obviously meaning that I would.

19:59.091 --> 20:00.585
Boom.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.867
Okay! Fine!

20:03.868 --> 20:05.334
He can be president.

20:05.335 --> 20:06.454
Yes!

20:06.455 --> 20:08.382
Make whatever stupid rules you want.

20:08.383 --> 20:10.309
At least now I won't have people calling

20:10.310 --> 20:12.384
and complaining 24 hours a day.

20:12.385 --> 20:14.552
- Wait, they call you?
- All the time.

20:14.553 --> 20:16.859
Oh, and no more of those horrible meetings.

20:16.860 --> 20:18.159
So boring.

20:19.127 --> 20:20.100
There are meetings?

20:21.347 --> 20:22.616
Twice a week.

20:22.617 --> 20:24.164
Plus there's the monthly
chat with the plumber,

20:24.165 --> 20:25.276
the daily argument with the super,

20:25.277 --> 20:26.789
paying the maintenance bills... oh, my God.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.137
The bookkeeping alone nearly killed me.

20:28.138 --> 20:29.451
But you'll find out soon enough. See ya!

20:39.994 --> 20:42.465
Congratulations, Wheeler.
You saved tar beach.

20:43.515 --> 20:44.963
And you know, if you squint,

20:44.964 --> 20:46.938
the helicopters kind
of look like fireflies.

20:47.655 --> 20:51.422
So... turns out that politics
really is about compromise.

20:52.615 --> 20:55.015
Marshmallow, madam president?

20:55.355 --> 20:57.139
Oh, my God. How much
fun is this? I love it!

20:57.140 --> 20:58.811
I cannot believe I was
gonna try to shut this down.

20:58.812 --> 21:00.577
Oh, my God, it reminds me
of when I used to go to camp.

21:00.578 --> 21:03.115
I swear, I have a million
stories from camp. A million!

21:03.561 --> 21:04.803
So here's the first one.

21:04.804 --> 21:06.290
One day, when I was seven years old...

21:06.291 --> 21:08.002
I'll give you five bucks to hug sondra.

21:08.550 --> 21:11.309
For the last time, she
died of natural causes!

21:12.305 --> 21:18.591
