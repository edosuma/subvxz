WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:05.603
His only imperfection
was that he could.

00:05.639 --> 00:08.071
<i>Only feel one thing at a time.</i>

00:08.108 --> 00:10.274
What does it taste like?
E flat major?

00:10.310 --> 00:13.111
Shades of blue,
and blue smells like home.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.480
<i>Makes you feel safe.
My true duty.</i>

00:15.515 --> 00:17.193
Is to know what is right
and what is wrong,

00:17.217 --> 00:19.617
And to follow what is right
no matter what the cost.

00:19.653 --> 00:22.286
For the sake of all the souls
watching us right now.

00:22.322 --> 00:26.090
Where will professor voigt be? In a
secure side ceremony beginning at 7:30.

00:26.126 --> 00:29.293
<i>We'll use the art
to smuggle in a bit of explosive.</i>

00:29.329 --> 00:31.029
<i>As well as a pencil fuse.</i>

00:31.064 --> 00:32.764
<i>The painting will hang
in the library.</i>

00:32.799 --> 00:34.932
<i>We use that to smuggle in
the potassium chloride.</i>

00:34.968 --> 00:38.469
Insert the fuse, crack it, the chemicals
react, you have about 40 seconds to get away.

00:38.505 --> 00:41.105
The explosion
is just a distraction.

00:41.141 --> 00:44.509
Faber takes voigt to the library down
the hall where I'll be waiting for him.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.310
And operation marigold
dies with him.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.880
What are your specific plans
as a triple agent? I will.

00:48.915 --> 00:51.149
<i>Use his son against him.
Duncan sinclair.</i>

00:51.184 --> 00:53.351
<i>Will do anything we ask.</i>

00:53.386 --> 00:55.553
He has done the reich
a great service.

00:55.588 --> 00:58.523
Rounding up a nest
of spies or something?

00:58.558 --> 01:00.525
Perhaps next year
it will be franz receiving.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.226
A medal.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.227
Schmidt's car will be
at the hotel soon.

01:04.263 --> 01:06.764
Go. I'll finish
with the painting.

01:09.002 --> 01:12.070
Don't look back. I won't.

01:12.105 --> 01:14.072
<i>They're gonna torture my son
in front of me,</i>

01:14.107 --> 01:17.075
Neil. And when they do, I will
talk. And that can't happen.

01:18.878 --> 01:21.312
You gotta get aurora to the
finish line. Please, neil. Go!

01:21.347 --> 01:23.214
<i>Stopping operation marigold.</i>

01:23.249 --> 01:25.650
<i>Is more important
than you or me.</i>

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.651 --> 02:02.019
"aurora luft. Harry james.

02:02.055 --> 02:05.323
Tom cummings. Alfred graves."

02:07.327 --> 02:10.261
I saw him in paris and poland.

02:10.295 --> 02:13.097
They left you in charge?
Where is he now?

02:13.133 --> 02:15.099
Here in berlin? Everyone else.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.369
Off to the big party?
Left you on your own?

02:18.404 --> 02:20.316
<i>You and your colleagues gave
brigadefuhrer faber a good ru.</i>

02:20.340 --> 02:23.407
Just blew up a bridge.
Knocked off a tank or two.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.777
Nothing compared
to what you lot get up to.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.646
That's a compliment to your
late leader, colonel sinclair.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.018
The resourcefulness...

02:35.822 --> 02:37.822
The resilience you had.

02:39.859 --> 02:42.860
Most of you, anyway.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.862
Half of you are dead.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.200
RenÃƒÂ© vallieres, not before
he gave us details.

02:49.235 --> 02:51.102
On your training camp,

02:51.137 --> 02:53.037
Harry james and tom cummings
died in action,

02:53.072 --> 02:55.807
Which leaves miss luft.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.743
And mr. Graves.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.582
We want to know where they are.

03:04.617 --> 03:07.151
Haven't seen them for months.
I don't take.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.521
Pleasure in brutality,

03:10.557 --> 03:13.858
But my orders are to do
what is necessary.

03:13.893 --> 03:15.993
Where are they?

03:16.029 --> 03:18.763
Probably back in paris by now.

03:28.308 --> 03:30.274
<i>It's not what it sounds like.</i>

03:30.310 --> 03:33.511
He said you've done the reich a great
service. What I needed him to believe!

03:33.546 --> 03:36.514
That you're rounding up
a group of spies. Is that true?

03:39.052 --> 03:41.452
After everything we've seen
in poland,

03:41.487 --> 03:43.454
Everything we've had to do.

03:43.489 --> 03:46.557
He was ready to have her killed
because we didn't want her,

03:46.593 --> 03:49.227
Just like that,
and now you're taking his side?

03:49.262 --> 03:51.562
Sabine, it's not that simple.
Actually, I think it is.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.431
I've just been interrogated
by my superiors.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.633
Who have serious suspicions
about my loyalty.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.635
One wrong word, one wrong move,

03:57.670 --> 03:59.637
And we can both be shot.
Do you understand?

03:59.672 --> 04:02.206
The only way I could
explain my contact.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.208
With the allied spies
was to tell them.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.711
That I was fooling them
the whole time. A triple agent.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.713
A triple agent?

04:08.748 --> 04:10.882
So now you've learned
to tell three lies at once?

04:10.917 --> 04:14.151
You see that I had
no choice, don't you?

04:14.187 --> 04:18.055
So now what?
You do what they want?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.423
I do what I need to
in order to protect you.

04:20.459 --> 04:23.194
And to protect myself.

04:24.931 --> 04:28.532
I've come to a decision. I...

04:28.568 --> 04:31.335
We need to lay low.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.437
We need to behave. Behave?

04:33.473 --> 04:35.539
For a while, not much longer.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.909
And when the time is right,
we'll get out.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.911
We leave all this behind,
and we go to spain.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.812
So, we behave.

04:41.848 --> 04:44.048
One more night? A week?

04:44.083 --> 04:46.517
A month? Up until victory?
I don't know yet. The point is.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.552
We stay safe. How can we look.

04:48.588 --> 04:51.188
That girl in the eyes knowing
what's happened to her family?

04:51.224 --> 04:52.924
Knowing we are part of it.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.259
We make this possible
every day we behave!

04:55.295 --> 04:57.895
Do you really think
it's that simple?

04:57.931 --> 05:00.564
You think you know better?
Then go on, tell me.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.735
What should I do?
What would you have me do?

05:09.809 --> 05:11.876
It's all right, ania.

05:11.911 --> 05:14.312
It's all right.

05:16.749 --> 05:19.050
Let's go sit down.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.285
Come on.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.861
I can't be late.

05:33.466 --> 05:36.267
We'll talk more when I'm back.
About keeping us safe?

05:36.302 --> 05:37.802
About holding on.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.640
Maybe you're just
thinking a little small.

05:52.352 --> 05:56.253
Ania, that's some cherries
right from the tree.

06:11.004 --> 06:14.305
The syringe and the explosives
are loaded up.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.607
We were pinned down
when the air raid started.

06:16.642 --> 06:18.609
I saw some damage
on the way back.

06:18.644 --> 06:20.611
Looks like they were going
for the national radio.

06:20.646 --> 06:23.381
I've got a good feeling...

06:23.416 --> 06:25.316
Sorry.

06:27.253 --> 06:29.653
Where are neil and sinclair?

06:29.689 --> 06:32.957
They didn't come back.
Shouldn't they have?

06:32.992 --> 06:35.626
Yes. Hours ago. With william.
I've sent notice.

06:35.661 --> 06:37.661
Back to the camp. Any agents
operating in the area,

06:37.697 --> 06:39.737
We need to know what happened.
If they've been seen,

06:39.766 --> 06:41.866
If they're safe.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.035
I told him. Before we left,
I said, "you don't even."

06:44.070 --> 06:46.370
Have proof of life,
why would you take this risk?"

06:46.406 --> 06:48.172
And now aurora is heading
into faber's hands.

06:48.207 --> 06:51.042
I'll go to her hotel.
I'll stay by the radio.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.210
Let's confined her
to her bed, so...

06:53.246 --> 06:56.213
Franz. It's my pleasure
to introduce you.

06:56.249 --> 07:00.151
<i>To professor harald voigt.
Herr professor,</i>

07:00.186 --> 07:03.854
<i>Brigadefuhrer franz faber. You are
in his care tonight. Herr professor,</i>

07:03.890 --> 07:06.424
It is a true privilege.
Yes, yes.

07:06.459 --> 07:09.026
I'd be more privileged
if this entire ordeal were over.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.995
You needn't be concerned;

07:11.030 --> 07:13.097
You are perfectly safe
in his hands.

07:13.132 --> 07:16.867
I just need to be back at work.
It is the worst possible time.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.503
There is no one to continue
your work in your absence?

07:19.539 --> 07:21.172
Of course not! The professor.

07:21.207 --> 07:24.241
Leaves nothing written.
For security.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.911
Of course. Very prudent.

07:26.946 --> 07:30.514
You will be kept sequestered
until the last moment, at 7:30.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.451
Your award should take
no more than 10 minutes.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.453
I'll escort you back
to your laboratory,

07:35.488 --> 07:38.355
And your "ordeal" is over.
Thank you.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.926
<i>I have the reichssicherheitsdienst
outside if you'd care to come with me.</i>

07:41.961 --> 07:45.763
Thank you, franz.
I'll see you both shortly.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.785
Come on!

08:42.822 --> 08:45.456
Your car is early! Coming!

09:44.050 --> 09:47.751
Even your leader tried
to spare himself this.

09:50.456 --> 09:52.823
You might follow his example.

09:52.858 --> 09:55.092
Not by suicide.

09:55.127 --> 09:57.528
Something more civilized,

09:57.563 --> 10:00.431
Like a conversation.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.306
I've seen you before.

10:10.876 --> 10:13.611
At terre-du-fils.

10:13.646 --> 10:16.580
All the men in that village
slaughtered in reprisals.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.649
Then you know
what we're capable of.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.784
I saw you. I saw your boss.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.786
That kind of work?

10:22.822 --> 10:24.788
Not your cup of tea.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.962
You're wrong.

10:35.234 --> 10:38.402
Keep going.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.324
Thank you.

11:38.064 --> 11:40.664
It's beautiful.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.100
Ulli.

11:43.135 --> 11:45.703
Isn't she magnificent?

11:45.738 --> 11:48.005
Absolutely exquisite.

11:51.143 --> 11:54.645
Each of these statues
expresses female perfection.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.815
The gentleness, the fertility...
Good evening.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.984
<i>Herr oberguppenfuhrer.
Brigadefuhrer.</i>

12:01.020 --> 12:03.520
<i>How are you, frau bauer?
Lovely to see you. And you.</i>

12:03.556 --> 12:07.191
How was your afternoon?
Other than a minor air raid,

12:07.226 --> 12:09.393
Everything was satisfactory.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.862
<i>Wonderful.
Herr oberguppenfuhrer!</i>

12:11.897 --> 12:14.231
Hello, reinhardt. How are you?

12:14.266 --> 12:17.334
Splendid, sir.
May I introduce helene bauer?

12:17.370 --> 12:19.336
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

12:43.562 --> 12:45.062
Enough.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.831
What's that? It's enough.

12:47.867 --> 12:50.234
You're ready?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.636
Yes. Take him down.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.248
The other spies, where are they?

13:07.453 --> 13:10.421
Don't make me do it
in front of them.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.423
Everything we're trained to do.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.058
Is not to talk.

13:15.094 --> 13:18.762
I won't be humiliated
in front of more than one man.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.834
Bring his chair here.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.178
Make sure his cuffs are secure.

13:43.155 --> 13:46.690
I will give you privacy,
but the guard stays.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.494
Give us some room.

14:00.606 --> 14:02.606
Talk.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.287
It's gone. The syringe.

14:41.322 --> 14:43.522
I know.

14:43.558 --> 14:46.325
A member of the security staff
found it in the canvas lining.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.505
And brought it to me. I told him
I'd handle it personally,

14:48.529 --> 14:50.262
And that our orders are.

14:50.298 --> 14:52.498
That the ceremony
should still unfold as planned.

14:52.533 --> 14:55.568
You covered it up?
No. I told him to keep quiet,

14:55.603 --> 14:58.437
That it's important morale is
maintained on a day like this.

14:58.472 --> 15:00.606
I'll need your gun.

15:00.641 --> 15:02.541
What?! Keep your holster closed.

15:02.577 --> 15:04.655
And no one will know it's
missing. Just give it to me.

15:04.679 --> 15:06.812
Nothing can trace back to me.

15:06.847 --> 15:09.214
This is our one chance.
And we're out of time.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.984
Just give me your gun.

15:12.019 --> 15:13.886
I'll bring voigt to the library.

15:13.921 --> 15:15.821
You need to find
a weapon on your own.

15:25.366 --> 15:28.634
<i>When did you
last see aurora luft?</i>

15:28.669 --> 15:31.570
I haven't seen either of them
since I was in france.

15:31.606 --> 15:35.040
Why are you in berlin?
My boss wanted to see his son,

15:35.076 --> 15:37.710
And I was here to protect him.
How did you enter the country?

15:37.745 --> 15:40.179
Let's cut to the chase, alright?

15:40.214 --> 15:42.214
I've been out of touch
with camp x a long time.

15:42.249 --> 15:44.083
You're not going
to get much out of me.

15:44.118 --> 15:47.553
That's a shame.
Shall I call my man back?

15:47.588 --> 15:50.055
Wait, wait.

15:50.091 --> 15:53.892
I said I saw you...
The day the general was killed.

15:53.928 --> 15:57.096
And terre-du-fils
was selected for reprisals.

15:57.131 --> 15:59.098
My team and I, we were watching.

15:59.133 --> 16:02.001
What does that have to do with...
we know from reliable sources.

16:02.036 --> 16:06.138
That your boss was supposed
to execute the entire village,

16:06.173 --> 16:08.941
But we saw him spare
women and children.

16:08.976 --> 16:11.410
That's right.

16:11.445 --> 16:13.746
Faber makes his own rules.

16:13.781 --> 16:16.348
Just like my boss
made his own rules.

16:16.384 --> 16:19.351
You don't get to be them,
playing this game,

16:19.387 --> 16:21.520
Unless you do that.

16:21.555 --> 16:23.856
You do what it takes.

16:23.891 --> 16:26.792
There are two ways.

16:26.827 --> 16:30.696
One is violent and merciless,

16:30.731 --> 16:33.465
The other is strategic.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.736
Go on.

16:37.772 --> 16:39.972
Our bosses,

16:40.007 --> 16:42.941
They made a deal.

16:42.977 --> 16:44.977
We can make a deal.

16:46.981 --> 16:49.148
Ullie!

16:49.183 --> 16:51.550
Where have you been?

16:51.585 --> 16:54.086
Thank you. For what?

16:54.121 --> 16:56.855
Inviting me.
Sharing this with me.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.892
I knew that I would be
surrounded by great minds.

16:59.927 --> 17:02.561
And leaders, but I had no idea.

17:02.596 --> 17:04.563
There would be so much art.

17:04.598 --> 17:08.634
I... I've never seen
pieces like these,

17:08.669 --> 17:11.603
Even when I was working
at the reichsmuseum.

17:11.638 --> 17:13.605
Please come with me.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.641
There's something
I want you to see.

17:21.982 --> 17:24.383
This one.

17:26.353 --> 17:28.587
I've seen in it books,
but I never thought

17:28.622 --> 17:31.023
I'd see it in person.

17:31.058 --> 17:33.025
Look at her.

17:33.060 --> 17:34.760
The silhouette.

17:34.795 --> 17:36.795
The curve of her skin.

17:36.831 --> 17:39.798
The hair.

17:39.834 --> 17:43.001
You can almost touch it.

17:43.037 --> 17:46.538
So much more beautiful up close.

17:50.344 --> 17:52.511
Helene.

17:52.546 --> 17:55.681
I'm sorry. That was so forward.

17:55.716 --> 17:59.885
No. There is no need.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.388
Your forwardness, I admire it.

18:03.424 --> 18:06.058
I always have.

18:06.093 --> 18:09.762
You are intoxicating.

18:14.001 --> 18:16.502
I look at you and...

18:16.537 --> 18:19.071
I'm lost.

18:20.541 --> 18:23.342
Then keep looking.

18:54.475 --> 18:57.342
What did faber have
in mind for sinclair?

18:57.378 --> 18:59.878
Over here, it's the prisoners
who answer the questions.

18:59.914 --> 19:02.581
Sinclair's no longer in
the picture so there's no harm.

19:04.485 --> 19:06.451
You needed something from him.

19:06.487 --> 19:08.487
Maybe I can help.

19:10.457 --> 19:12.925
We were going to keep
his son with us as leverage.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.960
We were going
to send him back to canada.

19:14.995 --> 19:17.930
And make him work for us
as a double agent.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.467
That's a good plan.

19:22.503 --> 19:24.903
It would have worked.

19:26.574 --> 19:28.307
It still can.

19:28.342 --> 19:30.909
Use me.

19:30.945 --> 19:33.712
My life in exchange
for new intelligence.

19:33.747 --> 19:35.581
Our superiors wanted sinclair.

19:35.616 --> 19:38.083
Interrogated and executed
as a morale victory.

19:38.118 --> 19:40.085
They'd want the same for you.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.221
Why kill a man.

19:42.256 --> 19:44.890
When he can become an asset?

19:44.925 --> 19:47.893
Intelligence speeds the war,
saves lives.

19:47.928 --> 19:50.629
We don't disagree. "We"?

19:50.664 --> 19:53.498
<i>The brigadefuhrer and i.
Who has your loyalty?</i>

19:53.534 --> 19:56.902
Faber or your superiors?

19:56.937 --> 19:58.570
He does.

19:58.606 --> 20:00.672
Send me back.

20:00.708 --> 20:02.774
You'll make him proud.

20:08.148 --> 20:10.082
I have a young niece.

20:10.117 --> 20:13.352
She's all the family
I have left.

20:13.387 --> 20:16.955
I'm all she's got.
No, I don't believe you.

20:16.991 --> 20:18.957
In my jacket,

20:18.993 --> 20:21.159
The pocket left front,
there's a letter.

20:21.195 --> 20:24.296
Take it.

20:52.026 --> 20:55.661
I can't stand to think what will
happen to her if I die too.

20:57.665 --> 20:59.731
Let me live;

20:59.767 --> 21:02.768
I'll give you
what your boss wants.

21:04.772 --> 21:06.738
Or you can carry on.

21:06.774 --> 21:09.107
Torturing me,
but you'd be no further ahead.

21:10.744 --> 21:14.179
In this game, you're only
as good as your strongest asset.

21:14.214 --> 21:16.915
I can be that asset.

21:18.352 --> 21:20.319
My superiors didn't approve
that arrangement.

21:20.354 --> 21:22.635
<i>From the brigadefuhrer; why
would they approve it from me?</i>

21:25.826 --> 21:29.394
You lot really don't know
what you're doing, do you?

21:29.430 --> 21:32.698
This is why we've got networks all
over france; You've got nothing.

21:32.733 --> 21:35.133
You don't know...

21:35.169 --> 21:37.336
Forget it about it, mate.
Go on, just get on with it.

21:37.371 --> 21:39.471
Salute, march,
do as you're told.

21:41.208 --> 21:44.376
I mistook you for a spy,
not a soldier.

21:44.411 --> 21:47.312
If I allow you.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.247
To escape, I will be blamed.

21:49.283 --> 21:51.450
What would faber do?

21:51.485 --> 21:55.087
He would do
what he needed to do,

21:55.122 --> 21:57.389
And then he would
protect himself.

21:57.424 --> 22:00.859
There are ways
you can shift the blame.

22:00.894 --> 22:02.861
And then take the credit
when intelligence.

22:02.896 --> 22:04.863
Starts coming in from canada.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.508
There... There might be a way.

22:20.581 --> 22:22.581
I have one condition.

22:24.618 --> 22:25.618
Condition?

22:25.652 --> 22:27.719
A request.

22:27.755 --> 22:30.589
As a gentleman.

23:11.131 --> 23:13.198
This isn't the way
to the main cells.

23:13.233 --> 23:17.135
Unlock this door.

23:25.679 --> 23:28.180
This goes into receiving area.
After that is a service gate.

23:28.215 --> 23:30.382
This receiving area?
It should be clear.

23:30.417 --> 23:33.185
Just in case it's not.

23:33.220 --> 23:35.687
Drop your watch. They'll want
to know how you got free of.

23:35.722 --> 23:38.123
The cuffs. You used the buckle.
Good thinking.

23:38.158 --> 23:40.025
Once a week, as we agreed.

23:40.060 --> 23:42.527
<i>Look for the advert in der sturmer
it'll tell you what time.</i>

23:42.563 --> 23:44.529
I'll leave the radio
in the safe house.

23:44.565 --> 23:47.099
Use 5 across from last week's
crossword as the encryption key.

23:48.936 --> 23:51.837
Ready? William?

23:51.872 --> 23:53.772
Drop your weapons!

23:55.175 --> 23:56.575
Do it.

23:58.512 --> 24:00.579
Go!

24:00.614 --> 24:02.581
Come on. Guards!

24:10.366 --> 24:12.767
<i>Heil!</i>

24:29.285 --> 24:31.385
Have you seen helene?

24:31.421 --> 24:33.254
No.

24:33.289 --> 24:35.956
She wouldn't want to miss this.

24:35.992 --> 24:38.859
This allied attack
on our capital a few hours ago.

24:38.895 --> 24:41.295
Well, I apologize.

24:41.331 --> 24:43.130
On their behalf
if you missed it.

24:43.166 --> 24:45.166
As a lion is threatened.

24:45.201 --> 24:48.402
By a mosquito, so are we.

24:52.408 --> 24:55.576
But we are not here
to discuss mosquitoes.

24:55.611 --> 24:57.812
We are here to celebrate the man.

24:57.847 --> 25:00.014
Who will put blood
into the veins.

25:00.049 --> 25:02.950
Of our panzers and our aircraft,

25:02.985 --> 25:06.187
The man who will help us
win this war.

25:09.625 --> 25:11.292
William! What happened?

25:11.327 --> 25:13.828
Come here. Help me.

25:16.466 --> 25:20.101
Easy. Alright. Alright.

25:20.136 --> 25:22.503
Here you go.

25:24.841 --> 25:26.941
Where is he?

25:34.951 --> 25:37.017
It was a double cross.

25:37.053 --> 25:40.654
Faber was going to torture
william in front of him.

25:40.690 --> 25:42.656
Sinclair knew.

25:42.692 --> 25:44.692
He gave his life
to save his son.

25:50.366 --> 25:53.033
I'll find you something to eat.

25:53.069 --> 25:55.035
I thought we had him.

25:55.071 --> 25:58.606
I thought he could be trusted.
It was a risk. We knew that.

25:58.641 --> 26:01.208
Sinclair knew that.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.446
Where's aurora? She's gone.

26:05.481 --> 26:08.416
She's at the event.
She's in their hands.

26:08.451 --> 26:10.618
We have to get her.

26:10.653 --> 26:12.787
<i>Herr professor voigt,</i>

26:12.822 --> 26:15.222
Your breakthrough.

26:15.258 --> 26:18.893
In the revolutionary discipline
of synthetic oil production.

26:18.928 --> 26:21.328
Sets us free from our dependence.

26:21.364 --> 26:23.564
On fuel from foreign soils.

26:23.599 --> 26:26.200
Your formula will create.

26:26.235 --> 26:28.836
An exponential
increase in production.

26:28.871 --> 26:31.572
That will blaze the path.

26:31.607 --> 26:34.408
To germany's glorious future.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.867
When shall we expect
production to begin?

26:59.902 --> 27:02.102
I'm still finalizing
the formula.

27:02.138 --> 27:06.240
<i>Within days, reichsfuhrer.</i>

27:08.611 --> 27:10.744
On behalf of the fuhrer,

27:10.780 --> 27:14.348
The silver cross.
The fatherland thanks you.

27:16.319 --> 27:19.086
Come with us. Move!

27:19.121 --> 27:22.189
Remain calm!
This way, professor!

27:22.225 --> 27:24.358
<i>Have the reichsfuhrer
exit immediately!</i>

28:02.198 --> 28:04.198
Where is he?

28:06.102 --> 28:09.403
Where's voigt?

28:15.011 --> 28:17.745
It was you.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.780
You took the syringe.

28:27.557 --> 28:30.257
You would have used
this explosive on voigt?

28:30.293 --> 28:32.560
Yes.

28:36.966 --> 28:40.401
You would have died with him.
That's right.

28:40.436 --> 28:42.503
You forced me
to change the plan!

28:42.538 --> 28:44.438
I had no choice.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.440
Do you hear yourself speak?

28:46.475 --> 28:48.442
They found out
I was working with you;

28:48.477 --> 28:50.511
I had to convince
them otherwise.

28:52.081 --> 28:54.081
Where's sinclair?

28:57.053 --> 28:58.652
I'm sorry.

28:58.688 --> 29:01.922
And neil?

29:03.359 --> 29:05.326
They forced my hand.
What have you done?

29:05.361 --> 29:08.362
You all forced my hand!

29:12.068 --> 29:14.735
Then finish the job.

29:16.706 --> 29:18.072
Franz!

29:18.107 --> 29:21.175
Franz, do it.

29:21.210 --> 29:23.877
Franz, tell me what's going on!

29:23.913 --> 29:27.214
This woman is not
who you thought she was.

29:27.249 --> 29:30.217
Her name is aurora
and she's a spy.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.538
Clever.

29:42.573 --> 29:45.274
She ignited the bullets
as a distraction.

29:45.309 --> 29:47.710
To get himmler's guards
away from voigt.

29:47.745 --> 29:50.012
Why? To kill him.

29:50.047 --> 29:52.748
There was a syringe
with a lethal fluid hidden.

29:52.783 --> 29:54.761
In the painting. I came to see
who would retrieve it.

29:54.785 --> 29:57.586
She's been deceiving you, me,

29:57.621 --> 30:00.789
Sabine.

30:00.825 --> 30:04.693
So this was all a lie?
From our first conversation?

30:07.364 --> 30:09.631
I should have known.

30:09.667 --> 30:12.234
Too good to be true.
Pull the trigger, franz.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.636
That's what you want?

30:14.672 --> 30:17.106
Do the reich proud.

30:17.141 --> 30:19.875
What's one more death? Shut...

30:19.910 --> 30:22.077
What are you thinking, franz?!

30:22.113 --> 30:24.580
We need to bring her in, break
her and then deal with her!

30:24.615 --> 30:26.482
I won't break.
I'll take her myself.

30:26.517 --> 30:29.351
Go! See to voigt!
Make sure there are no others!

30:29.386 --> 30:32.821
I won't break
because I know my true duty.

30:32.857 --> 30:35.524
"My true duty is to know what is
right from what is wrong,

30:35.559 --> 30:37.826
And to do what is right
no matter what the cost."

30:37.862 --> 30:40.596
I think of all the loved ones
watching from above, watching.

30:40.631 --> 30:43.799
Right now, and I wonder,

30:43.834 --> 30:47.069
What would they feel?
What would they feel.

30:47.104 --> 30:49.438
If they could only feel
one thing at a time?

30:49.473 --> 30:51.840
That's enough!

30:53.477 --> 30:55.677
Guards!

30:55.713 --> 30:57.679
The gunfire was her.
She's a spy.

30:57.715 --> 30:59.782
There may be more!

33:06.477 --> 33:09.077
Well? Have they found
the suspect?

34:10.474 --> 34:13.875
Go! Protect the professor!

34:13.911 --> 34:15.877
Find faber!

34:15.913 --> 34:18.280
Here! Here!
Come with me! Come, come!

34:18.315 --> 34:20.782
Get in! Get in!

34:23.887 --> 34:25.520
Take us straight
to headquarters.

34:25.556 --> 34:26.855
Don't move.

34:29.092 --> 34:31.159
Keep your hands where they are.

34:31.195 --> 34:33.862
You saw that explosion?

34:33.897 --> 34:35.998
Do you want to know what it was?

34:56.553 --> 34:58.553
He finally fell asleep.

34:58.588 --> 35:01.656
About an hour ago.
Still won't eat though.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.961
I can't even think
what he's been through.

35:08.598 --> 35:10.265
Yeah.

35:10.300 --> 35:13.034
A few weeks
at the camp infirmary,

35:13.070 --> 35:16.705
And he'll get his strength back.

35:18.375 --> 35:21.509
To the end of endless oil.

35:44.668 --> 35:47.168
Franz faber.

35:53.176 --> 35:55.377
What do we do with schmidt?

35:55.412 --> 35:57.312
Smuggle him out to england.

35:57.347 --> 35:59.748
Squeeze him for the locations
of more oil fields.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.983
Colonel mayhew and the raf
will have a field day.

36:04.187 --> 36:06.187
What's wrong?

36:08.425 --> 36:10.392
We're doing it again.

36:10.427 --> 36:12.994
Doing what? Getting it done,

36:13.029 --> 36:14.796
Moving on,

36:14.831 --> 36:17.232
Leaving people behind
like they don't matter.

36:17.267 --> 36:19.801
Sabine.

36:30.113 --> 36:33.348
She didn't want
to sleep in the bedroom.

36:33.383 --> 36:36.384
Because it was a boy's?

36:36.420 --> 36:39.521
Because she doesn't want me
out of her sight.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.126
Franz isn't here.

36:45.162 --> 36:47.395
I came to see you.

36:47.431 --> 36:49.431
I'm...

36:49.466 --> 36:52.500
I'm sorry,
we don't have much time.

36:52.536 --> 36:54.736
Can we sit?

37:15.325 --> 37:17.325
There's something
you need to know.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.061
I was gonna say the same thing.

37:20.096 --> 37:23.331
You're in danger. You need
to leave berlin. Franz is...

37:23.366 --> 37:26.534
I know. How do you know?

37:28.205 --> 37:31.005
He was ready to betray us,

37:31.041 --> 37:33.041
But then he didn't.

37:34.444 --> 37:36.411
What do you mean?

37:36.446 --> 37:40.081
Sabine...

37:40.116 --> 37:42.250
He fought the reich.

37:42.285 --> 37:45.053
He pushed a knife
into its heart.

37:48.492 --> 37:50.992
He did an extraordinary thing.

37:51.027 --> 37:53.695
I'm so sorry.

38:19.089 --> 38:21.589
<i>The first mission in the field,</i>

38:21.625 --> 38:25.426
<i>Your first time jumping out
of a plane into empty space;</i>

38:25.462 --> 38:27.562
It's terrifying,

38:27.597 --> 38:29.731
It sucks the breath
out of your lungs,

38:29.766 --> 38:32.534
Your heart pounds
into your ribs,

38:32.569 --> 38:35.837
Your hands feel like ice.

38:39.776 --> 38:42.010
Once you land, you have to make.

38:42.045 --> 38:44.546
Decisions on your own,

38:44.581 --> 38:48.249
Choices that nothing
can really prepare you for,

38:48.285 --> 38:50.218
That you have to remember.

38:50.253 --> 38:52.253
And live with.

38:52.289 --> 38:54.255
<i>You'll disappear.</i>

38:54.291 --> 38:56.925
<i>And you might never come back.</i>

38:56.960 --> 38:58.927
<i>If you're caught,</i>

38:58.962 --> 39:01.195
<i>You're fair game for torture.</i>

39:01.231 --> 39:03.464
<i>There's no uniform
to protect you.</i>

39:23.720 --> 39:26.854
<i>Survival rate in the field
is only 50%.</i>

39:26.890 --> 39:28.756
<i>They won't write about you
in the papers.</i>

39:28.792 --> 39:31.292
<i>You won't get any parades.</i>

39:49.412 --> 39:51.245
Hello, mags.

39:53.416 --> 39:55.249
<i>The official secrets act means.</i>

39:55.285 --> 39:57.585
<i>You don't talk. Ever.</i>

39:57.621 --> 40:00.688
<i>Your family will never know
what you did.</i>

40:00.724 --> 40:03.558
<i>But everything you do.</i>

40:03.593 --> 40:05.660
<i>Will affect this fight.</i>

40:07.664 --> 40:09.631
<i>The people you see,</i>

40:09.666 --> 40:12.533
<i>The people you don't.</i>

40:14.170 --> 40:17.005
<i>The people you save... Ania?</i>

40:17.040 --> 40:19.874
<i>The people you don't.</i>

40:21.511 --> 40:25.947
Ania!

40:42.065 --> 40:44.032
<i>And the people that do.</i>

40:44.067 --> 40:47.935
<i>Remember you will be the people
who fought by your side.</i>

41:38.988 --> 41:41.723
<i>They'll carry your stories.</i>

42:30.707 --> 42:34.142
<i>They'll never forget.</i>

42:35.305 --> 42:41.277
