WEBVTT

00:02.869 --> 00:05.651
Damn! Wha... so he's dead, right?

00:05.676 --> 00:07.376
No, he's the lead. He can't be dead.

00:07.378 --> 00:09.121
Right?

00:10.880 --> 00:12.591
_

00:14.585 --> 00:16.351
Hey, I thought you wanted to, you know,

00:16.376 --> 00:17.806
Netflix and chill tonight.

00:17.831 --> 00:19.547
Ye... babe.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.683
You know that means sex, right?

00:22.921 --> 00:24.727
- We shouldn't tonight.
- What?

00:25.039 --> 00:26.138
Why not?

00:26.163 --> 00:28.075
I just don't think it's a good idea.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.034
Period.

00:30.451 --> 00:31.853
Oh.

00:31.878 --> 00:33.745
Wa... It's not a problem.

00:33.770 --> 00:35.948
You know, I have a designated towel

00:35.973 --> 00:37.787
for these occasions.

00:37.812 --> 00:39.393
It has, like,
a really busy pattern on it, so...

00:39.418 --> 00:40.850
- Hey, hey.
- What?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.840
Just give me a couple days, okay?

00:42.865 --> 00:44.982
Yeah.

00:45.007 --> 00:46.328
I get it.

00:47.010 --> 00:48.209
It's like a...

00:48.234 --> 00:50.978
generational thing, you know?

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:04.242 --> 01:06.450
You know, maybe it is
a generational thing.

01:06.475 --> 01:08.805
David was just always so weird about it.

01:08.830 --> 01:10.591
Oh, I bet he'd send you into the woods

01:10.616 --> 01:11.922
until the end of your moon.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.403
You've never had period sex?

01:13.428 --> 01:15.161
Not on purpose. Have you?

01:15.186 --> 01:17.265
Well, if you're a lesbian,
you have to go with the flow,

01:17.290 --> 01:18.964
otherwise you're celibate
for half the month.

01:18.989 --> 01:20.070
Oh, I never thought about that.

01:20.095 --> 01:21.219
And you don't even want to see

01:21.244 --> 01:22.367
when I sync up with a girlfriend.

01:22.392 --> 01:24.168
My bed looks like a crime scene.

01:24.194 --> 01:25.095
Thanks for the warning.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.666
Hey, we've finally
synced up, haven't we?

01:26.691 --> 01:28.378
Yeah! Happy day two.

01:45.553 --> 01:46.456
Wha...

01:55.929 --> 01:57.739
What the hell is going on in here?

01:57.764 --> 01:58.677
Sorry.

01:58.702 --> 01:59.727
No, you're not.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.619
City ordinances clearly state

02:01.644 --> 02:03.942
you cannot begin
construction before 8:00 a.m.

02:03.967 --> 02:06.318
It is 7:53, and it sounds
like a drone strike in here.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.005
So tell me why I shouldn't
call the co-op president

02:08.030 --> 02:08.960
right this very second.

02:08.985 --> 02:10.836
Honey, unless you woke up

02:10.860 --> 02:12.157
spackled and pressed like that,

02:12.182 --> 02:14.110
you've been at work for a while too.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.167
"Spackled"?

02:15.192 --> 02:16.089
No, it looks good.

02:16.257 --> 02:17.457
I won't tell on you.

02:17.482 --> 02:19.626
Listen, we got a deadline to hit.

02:19.651 --> 02:21.519
The guys got here early,
so I had them get started.

02:21.544 --> 02:22.846
Well, have them get stopped

02:22.871 --> 02:24.024
until 8:00 a.m.

02:26.608 --> 02:29.393
Guys. Cut the noise.

02:41.803 --> 02:43.366
What you looking for?

02:43.391 --> 02:46.237
Well, I was looking for my assistant,

02:46.262 --> 02:47.762
but now I'm looking for a sweetener

02:47.787 --> 02:48.652
that won't give me cancer.

02:48.677 --> 02:49.637
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:49.662 --> 02:51.266
I stopped at the tailor on my way in

02:51.291 --> 02:52.893
to check on your gown for the opera.

02:52.918 --> 02:56.686
Oh, and Feliciano is all set
to do your hair that night.

02:56.711 --> 02:58.497
Do I need to do anything for your date?

02:58.523 --> 02:59.555
Do you know who you're bringing yet?

02:59.580 --> 03:01.059
Still TBD, Liza.

03:01.084 --> 03:02.818
Diana. I was looking for you.

03:02.843 --> 03:03.660
Oh?

03:03.685 --> 03:06.301
Bryce is going to sit
in on this morning's

03:06.326 --> 03:07.786
- staff meeting.
- Oh.

03:07.811 --> 03:09.277
We just need to indulge him a little.

03:09.302 --> 03:10.846
Listen to his ideas.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.656
Keep an open mind.

03:12.681 --> 03:14.177
Of course.

03:22.426 --> 03:25.703
"P is for Pigeon,"
our lead title this season,

03:25.728 --> 03:28.224
is just weeks away from launching.

03:28.271 --> 03:32.040
It is the story of the
world's last passenger pigeon

03:32.065 --> 03:34.872
and a powerful meditation on the...

03:34.897 --> 03:37.462
extinction of the American middle class.

03:37.487 --> 03:39.091
How are the preorders so far?

03:39.118 --> 03:40.958
Slightly lower than we'd hoped,

03:40.983 --> 03:42.881
but 5,000 should put us on the
"Times" Best Seller list,

03:42.906 --> 03:44.547
and that is definitely within reach.

03:44.572 --> 03:47.329
I have put a call in
to the Audubon Society

03:47.354 --> 03:49.864
for a bird-watching and
reading doubleheader

03:49.889 --> 03:51.221
at The Cloisters.

03:51.246 --> 03:53.667
Got it. Can Millennial discuss their IP?

03:53.814 --> 03:55.846
We are planning a college tour

03:55.871 --> 03:57.024
for "The Deciding Decade."

03:57.049 --> 03:57.844
And?

03:57.869 --> 04:00.588
And, uh, we really want to
find the next Warsan Shire.

04:00.868 --> 04:02.480
Nobody's breaking poets right now,

04:02.505 --> 04:04.558
except BeyoncÃ©. Dead end.

04:05.497 --> 04:06.703
There.

04:06.728 --> 04:08.082
Your next authors.

04:08.106 --> 04:09.606
What's up? I'm Kray.

04:09.631 --> 04:11.070
And I'm Tay.

04:11.094 --> 04:13.289
- And we're...
- The Stoopid Girls!

04:15.146 --> 04:16.233
- Tay.
- Hey?

04:16.259 --> 04:17.685
Are you wearing an adult diaper?

04:17.711 --> 04:20.164
Uhh... yeah, I am!

04:20.189 --> 04:21.437
Wait, so are you.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.862
Oh, my God!

04:23.113 --> 04:26.058
Chonie chug challenge!

04:26.083 --> 04:28.150
First one to leak through their Depends

04:28.175 --> 04:29.808
is the winner.

04:29.833 --> 04:31.620
- Chugs.
- Chugs, mm-mm.

04:31.645 --> 04:33.453
Okay, here I go.

04:35.969 --> 04:37.768
There's another 14 minutes of this?

04:37.793 --> 04:39.104
I can scrub through to the end

04:39.129 --> 04:40.161
if you want to see who wins.

04:40.186 --> 04:41.783
I'm not sure this is

04:41.808 --> 04:43.418
on brand for us.

04:43.443 --> 04:45.262
Great books come from great ideas.

04:45.380 --> 04:47.314
We shouldn't be precious
about the source.

04:47.339 --> 04:49.212
And what ideas do these girls in...

04:49.237 --> 04:50.772
diapers have?

04:50.797 --> 04:52.833
They have 5 million subscribers.

04:52.858 --> 04:55.264
If even 1/100 of a percent
of them buys the book,

04:55.289 --> 04:56.696
they're on the "Times" Best Seller list.

04:56.721 --> 04:58.059
Right?

04:58.464 --> 05:01.247
That is their manager's contact.

05:01.557 --> 05:03.473
I hate talking on the
phone. What's wrong?

05:03.498 --> 05:05.956
Comment below if you've ever puked.

05:09.687 --> 05:12.009
Could The Stoopid Girls
really write a book?

05:12.034 --> 05:13.550
I mean, would they even want to?

05:13.575 --> 05:15.954
To make that much money being stupid,

05:15.980 --> 05:18.149
you have to be at least a
little bit smart, right?

05:18.174 --> 05:20.007
Yes, exactly, and if
they're thirsty enough

05:20.032 --> 05:22.098
to make 187 videos this year,
they'll be down

05:22.123 --> 05:23.647
for any platform that
feeds them more attention.

05:23.672 --> 05:25.954
Snap 'em now while they're
still just Internet famous.

05:25.979 --> 05:27.485
Oh, we emailed their manager.

05:27.510 --> 05:28.923
We just haven't heard back yet.

05:28.948 --> 05:30.822
Oh, they're probably just
busy prepping for VidPop.

05:30.847 --> 05:32.143
- VidPop?
- Mm-hmm.

05:32.168 --> 05:33.167
It's a YouTuber convention

05:33.192 --> 05:34.656
at the Javits Center this week.

05:34.681 --> 05:36.080
There's a YouTuber convention?

05:36.105 --> 05:37.675
No, there are dozens of them,

05:37.700 --> 05:39.233
and they're insanely popular.

05:39.258 --> 05:41.474
I had to promise the firstborn
I'm never having to get

05:41.499 --> 05:42.929
Hector and Dorff to be
the official jockstrap

05:42.954 --> 05:44.544
of the VidPop gift bags.

05:44.569 --> 05:46.074
Ugh. I'll get you passes.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.152
Great.

05:49.215 --> 05:51.343
Did we have to come

05:51.368 --> 05:53.030
this close to Beth Israel to meet Max?

05:53.055 --> 05:54.685
And did we have to come here?

05:54.710 --> 05:56.213
I told you, with a doctor,
you got to take it

05:56.238 --> 05:57.737
whenever and however you can get it.

05:57.762 --> 05:58.888
You know, whether it's sex

05:58.913 --> 06:00.977
or a tequila-lime chicken finger.

06:01.002 --> 06:02.600
We've hooked up in the on-call room

06:02.624 --> 06:03.590
three times this week.

06:03.615 --> 06:04.492
Lucky you.

06:04.517 --> 06:06.117
So anytime,

06:06.142 --> 06:07.468
anywhere?

06:07.493 --> 06:08.588
What if you're...

06:08.613 --> 06:10.295
you know...

06:10.529 --> 06:12.607
having your period?

06:12.632 --> 06:14.826
Why'd you whisper that?

06:14.851 --> 06:15.828
I don't know... I'm just a...

06:15.853 --> 06:17.799
I'm just asking a follow-up question,
never mind.

06:17.824 --> 06:19.428
No, no, no. It hasn't come up yet.

06:19.453 --> 06:21.082
But the only thing I
don't do on my period

06:21.107 --> 06:22.307
is a yoga inversion.

06:22.331 --> 06:23.889
So everything else is on the table?

06:23.915 --> 06:26.619
Wait, is Josh anti-period sex?

06:26.644 --> 06:28.548
No, that's offensive.

06:28.573 --> 06:29.967
I thought he was so woke.

06:29.992 --> 06:31.063
No, he is.

06:31.087 --> 06:32.479
He... wait, what's woke?

06:32.504 --> 06:34.016
Enlightened, i.e., he's not

06:34.041 --> 06:35.314
terrified of the female body.

06:35.339 --> 06:37.266
Oh, ah, you know what?
There's Max; let's ask him.

06:37.290 --> 06:39.743
No, no-no-no-no-no-no.

06:39.822 --> 06:41.183
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.495
Hey, uh, Max, this is my friend Liza.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.200
- And you remember Kelsey.
- Hey, again.

06:44.225 --> 06:45.454
- Nice to meet you, Liza.
- Hey.

06:45.479 --> 06:46.691
Um, honey, quick question.

06:46.717 --> 06:48.068
You're cool with period sex right?

06:48.092 --> 06:49.316
Yeah.

06:49.341 --> 06:50.571
I knew it.

06:50.596 --> 06:52.397
Oh, shit, it's me.

06:52.422 --> 06:54.169
I got to get back.

06:54.194 --> 06:56.032
My attending's letting
me do the episiotomy

06:56.057 --> 06:58.245
on a tiny woman having
a huge baby, so...

06:58.270 --> 06:59.944
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:00.722 --> 07:03.324
So? What do you guys think?

07:03.349 --> 07:04.658
Oh.

07:04.683 --> 07:06.586
- He seems really nice.
- Yeah.

07:06.612 --> 07:08.296
He... uh, he was super cute.

07:09.014 --> 07:10.208
Nice handshake.

07:10.336 --> 07:11.782
You know, it says a lot.

07:11.807 --> 07:12.776
It does, it does.

07:12.801 --> 07:14.315
Oh, I'm so glad you guys get him.

07:25.888 --> 07:28.480
God damn it!

07:28.783 --> 07:31.265
You are at least 45 minutes

07:31.290 --> 07:33.172
past the legal cutoff
time to be working.

07:33.197 --> 07:34.463
It's not even that late.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.940
I read 15 books a week for work.

07:36.965 --> 07:38.570
That is impossible to do with you

07:38.594 --> 07:40.566
jackhammering away over here.

07:40.591 --> 07:42.165
Do you even know what a jackhammer is?

07:42.190 --> 07:44.215
- I'm gonna call the board.
- All right, slow down.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.846
No, I don't need to slow down.

07:45.871 --> 07:47.576
What I need is peace.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.437
What I need is privacy.

07:49.463 --> 07:50.325
What I... Honey.

07:50.349 --> 07:51.617
What you need

07:51.643 --> 07:53.172
is to get fucked.

07:59.949 --> 08:01.687
Go, go, that way, that way.

08:18.522 --> 08:21.130
Okay, I have never
felt so old in my life.

08:21.155 --> 08:22.321
Ah... me neither.

08:22.346 --> 08:24.405
Okay, The Stoopid Girls
are on in an hour.

08:24.430 --> 08:26.864
Ugh, but maybe somebody else
has a book you could sell?

08:26.889 --> 08:29.290
Oh, God, I hope not.

08:30.465 --> 08:32.147
- All right, come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.474
Hey, guys!

08:39.499 --> 08:41.010
My name is Soy Random

08:41.034 --> 08:42.078
because I'm...

08:42.104 --> 08:44.656
- Soy random!
- Yeah!

08:44.681 --> 08:47.679
I've been eating way too
many gluten-free cupcakes

08:47.704 --> 08:50.256
so I made this exercise
bike to mix them up

08:50.281 --> 08:52.347
so I don't feel bad
about eating all of them!

08:53.569 --> 08:55.658
Oh, my God, she's Soy Random.

08:57.963 --> 09:00.250
All right, anything can be hacked.

09:00.275 --> 09:03.239
If you just use your brain, okay?

09:03.264 --> 09:04.172
Anything.

09:04.197 --> 09:05.483
I couldn't get a date

09:05.508 --> 09:06.947
until I figured out how to hack

09:06.972 --> 09:09.565
the vagina! Am I right?

09:09.590 --> 09:10.623
Ladies,

09:10.648 --> 09:12.898
watch at your own risk.

09:12.923 --> 09:14.666
Uh!

09:19.019 --> 09:20.954
Hey, y'all.

09:20.979 --> 09:23.639
- We're the...
- Stoopid Girls!

09:26.105 --> 09:27.485
- Ew.
- Gross.

09:27.510 --> 09:29.095
Who wants to poke

09:29.120 --> 09:30.772
the Dare Bear?

09:30.797 --> 09:32.023
Me! Me!

09:32.048 --> 09:33.234
Oh?

09:33.259 --> 09:35.092
Hey, look at this.

09:35.117 --> 09:38.306
Noob1993 dares me to wax off

09:38.331 --> 09:40.682
one of my eyebrows.

09:40.707 --> 09:42.960
- That's so stupid!
- So stupid!

09:42.985 --> 09:46.176
- Oh, yeah.
- Do me up, Tay!

09:46.201 --> 09:47.766
Waxing it on.

09:47.791 --> 09:49.219
Wax it on.

09:49.244 --> 09:50.963
Wax it off.

09:52.585 --> 09:53.684
Should I do it?

09:53.709 --> 09:54.666
Come on!

09:54.691 --> 09:55.684
Three.

09:56.148 --> 09:57.548
Two.

09:57.573 --> 09:58.867
One!

10:01.066 --> 10:03.013
Yeah!

10:03.038 --> 10:05.740
That was so stupid!

10:08.848 --> 10:11.194
They're gonna save the
publishing industry?

10:11.219 --> 10:12.986
Ah... Ah...

10:15.049 --> 10:16.590
Oh, yeah!

10:16.765 --> 10:19.368
I wonder if Bryce would
be into a lifehacker book,

10:19.393 --> 10:20.357
but, like,

10:20.608 --> 10:21.795
like a sexy one?

10:21.820 --> 10:22.701
I don't think you should let

10:22.726 --> 10:24.973
anyone who calls themselves a lifehacker

10:24.998 --> 10:26.493
anywhere near your coin purse.

10:26.518 --> 10:28.052
Oh, ooh. Guys, we're up, we're up.

10:28.077 --> 10:30.207
- Come on, move it along.
- Yeah, go, go. Go, go, go.

10:30.233 --> 10:31.497
Hey, dummies.

10:31.522 --> 10:32.924
Hi. I'm Liza,

10:32.949 --> 10:34.371
- and this is Kelsey...
- Hey.

10:34.396 --> 10:35.934
And we're from Millennial Print.

10:35.959 --> 10:38.369
We'd love to talk to
you about doing a book.

10:38.394 --> 10:39.571
- Really?
- But...

10:39.596 --> 10:42.360
how can I write a book if I
never learned how to read?

10:42.385 --> 10:43.957
Wait, where'd you say
you guys were from?

10:43.982 --> 10:47.310
Millennial, it's a imprint
with Empirical Publishing.

10:47.335 --> 10:49.964
Bah! Big words hurt my brain stub.

10:49.989 --> 10:52.023
- Picture time!
- Whoo!

10:52.048 --> 10:53.433
- Whoo!
- Oh.

10:53.458 --> 10:55.124
- Ha-ha.
- Yay. Okay.

10:55.149 --> 10:56.791
- Oh.
- All right, let's go.

10:56.816 --> 10:57.542
Uh, do you think you can

10:57.567 --> 10:59.583
center the jockstrap on your...
on your chin?

10:59.608 --> 11:01.609
But then I'm gonna get teabagged

11:01.634 --> 11:04.138
by this big nasty thing.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.955
Yep... no, just so they
can read it on Instagram.

11:05.980 --> 11:08.710
Dude, it's, like,
three grand for social media posts.

11:08.735 --> 11:09.883
My manager will kill me.

11:09.908 --> 11:11.082
Okay, I'm just gonna sneak one.

11:11.107 --> 11:12.862
- Go, take her off.
- Real quick, I'm sneaking one.

11:12.888 --> 11:14.819
- Buh-bye.
- Okay. Bye.

11:19.082 --> 11:20.335
Uh, excuse me?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.784
Uh, you're from Millennial Print, right?

11:22.809 --> 11:24.878
You're... Tay?

11:24.903 --> 11:26.401
Uh, Taylor.

11:26.839 --> 11:29.048
Nice to actually meet you.

11:29.073 --> 11:30.249
Um, look,

11:30.273 --> 11:32.812
I don't know if you would
be into this at all,

11:32.837 --> 11:35.784
but I actually have a novel that
I started when I was at Iowa,

11:35.809 --> 11:36.831
and I just, like, never did...

11:36.856 --> 11:38.255
You went to the Writers' Workshop?

11:38.280 --> 11:39.467
Yeah.

11:39.492 --> 11:42.672
Yeah, um, this whole
Stoopid Girls thing was

11:42.697 --> 11:44.169
supposed to be, like, a goof.

11:44.194 --> 11:47.430
Wow, this is... not
what I was expecting.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.095
I'm so grateful for it,

11:49.120 --> 11:51.037
but I just... I feel
kind of boxed in now.

11:51.099 --> 11:53.732
And my manager says that
dense historical fiction

11:53.757 --> 11:55.916
isn't trending, so for now, I'm stuck

11:55.941 --> 11:56.969
acting like a drunk child

11:56.993 --> 11:59.372
while I pay off the
rest of my student debt.

11:59.968 --> 12:01.400
You know what? Um...

12:01.425 --> 12:04.533
Send me a few chapters of your novel.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.511
I would love to read it.

12:06.536 --> 12:08.213
Oh, my God.

12:08.239 --> 12:09.718
Really?

12:10.587 --> 12:13.310
Thank you so much.
That would mean so much to me.

12:13.335 --> 12:15.326
You have no...

12:15.351 --> 12:18.735
Now slowly back away.

12:22.038 --> 12:24.139
Just... just trust me.

12:30.193 --> 12:32.301
Selfie? Hello.

12:36.659 --> 12:39.361
It's a historical novel about Theodora,

12:39.386 --> 12:41.513
the empress who went
from prostitute to power

12:41.537 --> 12:42.629
during the Byzantine era.

12:42.655 --> 12:44.298
Oh, I think I know a
drag queen by that name.

12:44.323 --> 12:45.215
Very funny.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.636
She's so cute when she
nerds out over books,

12:47.661 --> 12:48.816
- isn't she?
- No.

12:48.841 --> 12:50.377
This is about more than a book.

12:50.402 --> 12:51.929
I mean, if this hits,

12:51.954 --> 12:54.265
she could finally be who she really is

12:54.290 --> 12:55.923
and stop pretending every day.

12:55.948 --> 12:57.516
Oh. Hmm.

12:59.192 --> 13:01.930
Are you going home or you wanna...

13:01.955 --> 13:04.166
- Ugh... I just... I think...
- Oh, all right.

13:04.191 --> 13:05.278
No, it's good, it's good.

13:05.303 --> 13:06.990
I got a full sleeve tattoo
to do in the morning,

13:07.016 --> 13:08.467
so I'm gonna go home and sketch.

13:08.492 --> 13:09.885
Okay.

13:10.268 --> 13:11.487
Good night.

13:11.512 --> 13:12.970
- Good night, ladies.
- Bye.

13:12.995 --> 13:14.107
Good night.

13:14.132 --> 13:17.281
- Girl.
- Ugh, I know.

13:18.052 --> 13:19.336
Am I a prude?

13:19.361 --> 13:20.736
Uh, a little bit.

13:20.761 --> 13:22.480
But, you know, sooner or later,

13:22.505 --> 13:24.531
your desire to get laid is gonna trump

13:24.556 --> 13:26.626
your desire for your awkward modesty.

13:26.651 --> 13:28.091
And you're just gonna go for it.

13:28.116 --> 13:29.274
Yeah?

13:29.454 --> 13:30.720
Probably.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.842
Now, come on. It's our heavy flow day.

13:32.867 --> 13:34.759
I want to get home before
we get mauled by a bear.

13:34.784 --> 13:35.763
Ha!

13:37.939 --> 13:39.385
Excuse me.

13:40.181 --> 13:41.661
It is after 7:00 p.m.

13:41.686 --> 13:43.619
And you know the rules.

13:43.644 --> 13:45.811
You're not gonna get off

13:45.836 --> 13:48.352
so easily this time.

13:48.377 --> 13:51.156
So put down your big tool

13:51.181 --> 13:53.710
and stop all that...

13:53.978 --> 13:55.517
pounding.

13:55.542 --> 13:57.341
You done?

13:57.366 --> 13:59.101
You're liable to

13:59.126 --> 14:01.264
flood the basement?

14:01.289 --> 14:02.704
I don't... know... if that...

14:10.409 --> 14:12.898
- I know.
- Good morning, ladies.

14:12.923 --> 14:13.860
Hi.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.398
She's smiling.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.318
With both rows of teeth.

14:20.844 --> 14:22.106
Oh, no, thank you.

14:22.131 --> 14:24.365
I had one when I came in. Here.

14:24.390 --> 14:26.290
Is there a problem
with the opera tickets?

14:26.315 --> 14:28.114
No. I want you to have them.

14:28.139 --> 14:29.704
Take your boyfriend or...

14:29.921 --> 14:32.151
whatever it is you're doing now,
I can't keep track.

14:32.176 --> 14:33.175
Enjoy the opera.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.232
But your dress?

14:34.257 --> 14:35.465
And Feliciano...

14:35.490 --> 14:36.534
I already called him.

14:36.559 --> 14:37.964
I'm busy tonight. There's some

14:37.989 --> 14:39.856
construction in my building I need to

14:40.297 --> 14:41.977
stay on top of.

14:42.002 --> 14:43.766
- Well, I'd be happy to...
- No, Liza!

14:43.791 --> 14:46.480
This is something I need
to supervise personally.

14:47.886 --> 14:49.518
Enjoy the opera.

14:56.879 --> 14:58.148
Bryce will be here in a minute.

14:58.173 --> 14:59.472
Oh, cool.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.032
- Oh.
- Uh, I'm in the wrong room.

15:02.057 --> 15:04.342
No, no, no. This is Tay... lor.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.096
Uh, you might recognize her

15:06.122 --> 15:07.866
as one half of The Stoopid Girls.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.314
I thought I cancelled that
when I read the chapter.

15:10.339 --> 15:12.729
I'm... I'm supposed to be
on a VR meeting with Venmo.

15:12.754 --> 15:14.557
I'm acquiring Venmo. Don't tell anyone.

15:14.582 --> 15:17.504
Wait, Br... Bryce, why...
why would you cancel the meeting?

15:17.529 --> 15:18.924
The chapter was great.

15:18.949 --> 15:20.188
Great disappointment.

15:20.213 --> 15:22.627
Who wants to read historical
fiction from a Stoopid Girl?

15:22.652 --> 15:24.085
Feminist historical fiction.

15:24.110 --> 15:26.187
I love feminist historical fiction.

15:26.212 --> 15:27.567
Ask Doris Kearns Goodwin.

15:27.592 --> 15:29.402
I have her number. She's
a huge fan of mine.

15:29.427 --> 15:32.419
But she can't do
"smell my finger" like she can.

15:35.660 --> 15:36.903
Are you okay?

15:36.927 --> 15:38.228
Kray and I are starting the

15:38.254 --> 15:40.754
human pincushion
challenge in an hour, so

15:40.779 --> 15:42.345
I may as well get started.

15:42.370 --> 15:44.468
See, now, that's stupid.
That's your brand.

15:44.493 --> 15:45.799
Maybe we can do something with that.

15:45.824 --> 15:48.620
It's for digital, and
MTV already bought it.

15:48.645 --> 15:51.490
Oh, my meeting is at Venmo.

15:51.831 --> 15:53.219
Don't tell anyone.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.896
I am so sorry. Excuse me.

16:02.517 --> 16:03.935
That was very rude.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.041
You tried to game the system.

16:05.066 --> 16:06.345
Clever. I'll give you that.

16:06.370 --> 16:08.148
You wanted a YouTube author.

16:08.173 --> 16:09.439
Liza, relax.

16:09.464 --> 16:11.318
You're an asset, okay? Your job is safe.

16:11.343 --> 16:12.474
Why wouldn't it be?

16:12.499 --> 16:13.852
Because I'm recommending we cut staff

16:13.877 --> 16:15.741
by 45% next quarter.

16:16.165 --> 16:17.898
Not you, just the old people.

16:17.923 --> 16:19.086
Like Diana.

16:19.111 --> 16:20.193
Empirical has to change.

16:20.218 --> 16:21.676
Uh, can you?

16:22.381 --> 16:23.700
Your nostrils are flaring.

16:23.725 --> 16:25.917
I... I should have softened that.

16:25.942 --> 16:26.974
Spectrum.

16:36.923 --> 16:39.316
Babe, am I underdressed?

16:39.864 --> 16:41.148
People are wearing capes.

16:41.398 --> 16:43.688
- That's 'cause she's a vampire.
- Ah.

16:43.713 --> 16:45.622
Is it free?

16:45.647 --> 16:46.888
Yeah, it's a benefit.

16:46.913 --> 16:48.355
Everything's free.

16:48.380 --> 16:50.005
Thanks. Cheers, babe.

16:52.458 --> 16:54.250
They all go to the same plastic surgeon?

16:54.275 --> 16:57.013
'Cause they all look exactly the same.

16:57.529 --> 16:59.081
Inbreeding.

16:59.106 --> 17:01.383
The 1% likes to keep
the bloodlines closed.

17:01.408 --> 17:02.448
Ah.

17:05.012 --> 17:06.605
Wait, isn't that your boss?

17:08.250 --> 17:09.353
Yeah, should we go say hi?

17:09.377 --> 17:10.551
Uh, no. No-no-no.

17:10.577 --> 17:11.973
Uh, he's on a date.

17:11.999 --> 17:14.468
Huh. Good for him.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.499
She's hot.

17:15.525 --> 17:17.544
Actually, I'm gonna go use the restroom.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.311
- I'll meet you inside.
- All right.

17:26.487 --> 17:27.426
Excuse me?

17:27.842 --> 17:29.714
Uh, where is the, uh,

17:29.739 --> 17:31.547
plumber?

17:31.572 --> 17:32.906
Who, Enzo?

17:32.932 --> 17:35.962
He's already moved on to the
next jobsite in Westchester.

17:35.987 --> 17:36.929
What?

17:36.954 --> 17:38.498
Pipe's been laid, ma'am.

18:06.249 --> 18:07.379
Liza.

18:08.237 --> 18:09.755
Charles, hi.

18:09.780 --> 18:11.525
- Hi.
- Wow, um.

18:11.550 --> 18:13.366
I... I didn't know you
were gonna be here.

18:13.391 --> 18:15.136
This is such a surprise.

18:15.237 --> 18:17.170
Diana gave me tickets.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.354
How wonderful.

18:19.379 --> 18:21.161
Do you need a hand with that?

18:21.186 --> 18:22.791
Yes, I do...

18:22.816 --> 18:24.539
Do you mind?

18:38.853 --> 18:40.253
Charles.

18:40.636 --> 18:42.792
Radha. This is, uh,

18:42.817 --> 18:44.908
a colleague of mine. Liza Miller.

18:44.933 --> 18:46.633
Ah, it's lovely to meet you.

18:46.658 --> 18:47.638
Oh, you too.

18:47.663 --> 18:49.733
And what do you do at Empirical?

18:49.758 --> 18:51.132
Oh, I'm just an assistant.

18:51.157 --> 18:52.522
She's being modest.

18:52.546 --> 18:54.838
Liza's co-running our
Millennial imprint.

18:54.863 --> 18:57.812
How did it go today with
those Internet stars?

18:57.837 --> 18:59.114
The Stoopid Girls.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.515
A favor to our new investor,

19:01.540 --> 19:03.707
a young guy in tech.

19:03.732 --> 19:05.964
And Liza's imprint is the

19:06.053 --> 19:09.311
shiny penny that keeps him
interested in Empirical.

19:09.336 --> 19:10.712
That's me.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.253
Shiny penny.

19:12.278 --> 19:13.805
Actually,
I wanted to talk to you about something

19:13.830 --> 19:15.615
- that Bryce said today...
- Liza.

19:15.640 --> 19:16.676
Hi.

19:16.702 --> 19:19.443
Figured I'd hit the bar before we go in.

19:19.566 --> 19:21.145
Josh, you remember Charles.

19:21.170 --> 19:22.447
Yeah, nice to see you again.

19:22.472 --> 19:23.509
You too.

19:23.534 --> 19:25.529
- Uh, this is Radha.
- Pleasure.

19:25.555 --> 19:26.593
Hi.

19:26.617 --> 19:28.715
Oh, we should take our seats.

19:28.891 --> 19:30.223
Have fun tonight.

19:30.248 --> 19:31.450
You too.

19:31.475 --> 19:32.791
Please.

19:50.740 --> 19:53.031
That was fun.

19:53.056 --> 19:54.687
Never again, though, right?

20:03.391 --> 20:04.657
Man.

20:04.682 --> 20:07.030
Good thing I already ordered a Lyft.

20:07.055 --> 20:09.274
Denang will be here in 11 minutes.

20:09.299 --> 20:11.470
- Come on, this will be faster.
- What?

20:11.496 --> 20:12.859
Okay.

20:29.857 --> 20:31.718
We can go to the opera

20:31.743 --> 20:33.733
whenever you want.
