WEBVTT

00:02.534 --> 00:04.534
Which brings us to 2005...

00:04.835 --> 00:07.135
The Circle Park renovation was complete,

00:07.436 --> 00:10.136
and a young man
named Thomas Haverford

00:10.237 --> 00:12.305
was still two years away
from getting hired.

00:12.373 --> 00:15.241
Perhaps we could skip ahead
and just hit the highlights?

00:15.309 --> 00:17.610
I mean, I planned
a comprehensive retrospective,

00:17.678 --> 00:19.779
but I guess I can just focus
on the really important moments.

00:19.847 --> 00:22.982
Ah! The debate about getting
a pod-based coffee machine.

00:23.050 --> 00:25.818
Garry and I wrote a little
musical number about that,

00:25.886 --> 00:28.388
and it goes a little something
like thi--

00:28.455 --> 00:29.855
Can't we just quickly
shake hands,

00:29.890 --> 00:31.024
pretend we like each other,

00:31.091 --> 00:32.570
- and get out of here?
- I'm all for that.

00:32.593 --> 00:35.061
No, April, Ron,
we need to celebrate everything

00:35.129 --> 00:36.596
that we've done together
as a group.

00:36.663 --> 00:38.197
This is our last day here!

00:38.265 --> 00:41.267
Who knows when we'll all be
together like this again?

00:41.335 --> 00:42.702
Excuse me.
Hi.

00:42.770 --> 00:44.103
There's a swing in a park

00:44.171 --> 00:46.472
near my house that's been broken
for about three months.

00:46.540 --> 00:48.241
Is it possible
to get that fixed?

00:48.309 --> 00:52.145
Anything is possible
if you follow your dreams.

00:52.213 --> 00:53.313
Johnny Karate.

00:53.380 --> 00:55.115
Except getting a swing fixed.

00:55.232 --> 00:56.712
None of us
actually work here anymore.

00:56.767 --> 00:58.635
Come back in two hours
when the office is open.

00:58.703 --> 01:00.770
- Thank you.
- Wait.

01:00.838 --> 01:03.340
Actually, sir, we can help.

01:03.407 --> 01:06.676
We can and we will because
when we used to work here,

01:06.744 --> 01:08.478
helping people was our job.

01:08.546 --> 01:09.879
Forget about these old stories.

01:09.947 --> 01:11.081
Let's make a new one.

01:11.148 --> 01:12.716
Let's fix a swing.

01:12.783 --> 01:14.384
One last ride
for the Parks and Rec gang.

01:14.452 --> 01:15.452
Who's in?

01:15.453 --> 01:16.620
All: Yeah.

Okay, so what
is our first step

01:51.055 --> 01:52.723
on our quest to help this man?

01:52.790 --> 01:54.124
Does anyone remember?

01:54.192 --> 01:56.627
A parks and recreation
equipment requisition form.

01:56.694 --> 01:58.495
Correct.
Five points for Hufflepuff.

01:58.563 --> 02:00.063
Well,
everything's paperless now,

02:00.131 --> 02:02.900
and none of us has a log-in,
so can't access the computers.

02:02.967 --> 02:04.301
Hang on.

02:04.369 --> 02:07.237
I have one right here,
thanks to Leslie's scrapbook,

02:07.305 --> 02:09.673
"Thanks Form the Memories!"

02:09.741 --> 02:12.009
Oh, I knew those scrapbooks
were gonna come in handy.

02:12.076 --> 02:15.312
You came through
like you always do.

02:15.380 --> 02:16.580
God, I'm gonna miss you.

02:16.698 --> 02:18.999
Your confidence,
your joie de vivre,

02:19.067 --> 02:21.268
that crazy story about you
getting kicked out of En Vogue.

02:21.336 --> 02:23.570
Technically I kicked them out.

02:23.638 --> 02:24.838
When do you leave for Seattle?

02:24.906 --> 02:26.573
As soon as I get
my local real estate license.

02:26.641 --> 02:28.742
I'm married to a teacher,
and I love the man,

02:28.810 --> 02:31.145
but I also love diamond watches.

02:31.212 --> 02:32.646
Well, whatever happens,

02:32.714 --> 02:37.151
I know you are gonna live
an exciting and full life.

02:40.505 --> 02:45.209
3,400 square feet,
a beautiful view of Puget Sound,

02:45.277 --> 02:46.557
and if you look out this window,

02:46.578 --> 02:48.980
you can watch them build
the new Space Haystack

02:49.047 --> 02:50.281
around the Space Needle.

02:50.349 --> 02:51.449
Wow.

02:51.516 --> 02:53.217
I-I can hardly see
the needle anymore.

02:53.285 --> 02:54.565
I know.
It's kind of the point.

02:54.620 --> 02:56.989
So what are we thinking?

02:58.056 --> 02:59.390
Wow.

02:59.458 --> 03:01.359
It sold in two hours?

03:01.426 --> 03:03.628
You cannot beat
the Seattle real estate market.

03:03.746 --> 03:05.626
I think it's all that coffee
and legal marijuana

03:05.647 --> 03:08.282
has people wanting to buy houses
quickly and irrationally.

03:08.350 --> 03:09.384
Mm.

03:09.451 --> 03:10.985
But the giant commission check

03:11.053 --> 03:14.655
has me thinking
about Donna-Joe Adventure Quest.

03:14.723 --> 03:16.491
Ooh, where are we going?

03:16.558 --> 03:18.159
Well, it can't beat last year.

03:18.227 --> 03:20.328
I mean, Middle Korea,
so beautiful.

03:20.446 --> 03:21.679
Here's my idea.

03:21.747 --> 03:23.081
- The Amazon.
- Oh.

03:23.149 --> 03:25.483
Three weeks of the best
and most expensive places

03:25.551 --> 03:27.485
South America has to offer.

03:27.553 --> 03:28.620
I love it.

03:28.687 --> 03:30.321
Honestly, with the way
work is going,

03:30.389 --> 03:32.023
I just need this right now.

03:32.091 --> 03:36.161
The school cut the math club
and math.

03:36.228 --> 03:38.163
They just don't teach math
anymore.

03:38.230 --> 03:40.799
Aw, my poor little
do-gooder teacher baby.

03:40.917 --> 03:43.485
Why don't we cuddle up
on the couch, watch a movie,

03:43.552 --> 03:46.321
and then maybe later
I'll wear that little red thing?

03:46.389 --> 03:47.789
Yes.
The red thing.

03:47.857 --> 03:49.925
Here, let me get this.

Call Satan's niece.

03:56.866 --> 03:59.034
Hey, what do you want?

03:59.101 --> 04:02.437
And this is me DJ-ing
a boat party in Venezuela,

04:02.505 --> 04:04.439
kind of reminded me of the
two weeks you and I spent there.

04:04.507 --> 04:05.707
Oh, yeah, that happened.

04:05.775 --> 04:07.709
- Yeah, it did.
- April.

04:07.777 --> 04:09.077
What are you doing here?

04:09.145 --> 04:11.579
- Babe, have a seat.
- What's going on?

04:11.647 --> 04:13.848
Recently I was thinking
for the millionth time

04:13.916 --> 04:15.483
how lucky
I am to have found you,

04:15.551 --> 04:18.988
so I've decided
to treat yo' self.

04:19.805 --> 04:22.775
You're gonna buy me
a bunch of leather handbags?

04:22.892 --> 04:24.827
Donna is going
to take some of the money

04:24.894 --> 04:26.462
you usually use on your trips

04:26.529 --> 04:28.163
and establish
an education program

04:28.231 --> 04:29.765
through the foundation
I work for.

04:29.833 --> 04:32.067
It's called "Teach Yo' Self,"
and you and the other teachers

04:32.135 --> 04:34.002
will get money
for after-school programs,

04:34.070 --> 04:37.406
for music, art, math,
whatever you want.

04:37.474 --> 04:42.110
Baby, this is really generous,
but I love our trips,

04:42.178 --> 04:44.379
and honestly it's your money.

04:44.447 --> 04:45.881
You should spend it
how you want.

04:45.949 --> 04:47.182
This is what I want.

04:47.250 --> 04:49.017
I've had a lot of adventures.

04:49.085 --> 04:52.054
I single-handedly started
that doorknockers earring trend.

04:52.121 --> 04:54.022
I came in ninth
in <i>Italy's Got Talent.</i>

04:54.090 --> 04:56.358
- Yeah.
- I served on a NASCAR pit crew.

04:56.426 --> 05:01.030
I want a new kind of adventure,
and I want to take it with you.

05:01.448 --> 05:05.851
Okay, I feel like it's time
for me to get out of here.

05:05.919 --> 05:07.419
[Leslie sighs]

05:07.487 --> 05:08.520
What is this mess?

05:08.588 --> 05:10.089
Why are you all in my office?

05:10.156 --> 05:12.891
We are on one last mission
to help the people of Pawnee.

05:12.959 --> 05:15.394
Craig, can you sign
the requisition form?

05:15.462 --> 05:16.695
It'd speed things up.

05:16.763 --> 05:18.683
You know, Craig,
when I first met you, I thought,

05:18.698 --> 05:20.466
"There's a man
who loves his job."

05:20.533 --> 05:23.369
And then I thought,
"Oh, wow, he's intense."

05:23.436 --> 05:26.005
And then I thought,
"Oh, no, he's insane.

05:26.123 --> 05:28.363
That person is psychotic,
and I need to call the police."

05:28.425 --> 05:30.559
Yeah, that's usually the way
it goes.

05:30.627 --> 05:33.629
But I just think
you've come so far,

05:33.697 --> 05:35.765
and I'm so glad
that we are leaving

is substantial.

- No.

- Yes.

08:53.379 --> 08:56.248

and veins everywhere,

08:56.316 --> 08:57.616
then sign me up.

But at the end, we've brought
a child into the world.

- That's disgusting.
- No.

of the disgusting stuff

09:03.456 --> 09:05.058
off of it immediately.

09:06.126 --> 09:07.159
We're gonna be late
for dinner.

09:07.227 --> 09:09.462
- Okay.
- Let's go.

09:09.930 --> 09:11.096
- Hey.
- Come on in.

09:11.164 --> 09:13.666
Hey, always nice to see
Janet Snakehole

09:13.733 --> 09:15.634
and Burt Macklin in the mix.

09:15.702 --> 09:16.862
What are you guys dressed as?

09:16.903 --> 09:20.273
Oh, I'm Sandra Dee O'Connor.
Get it?

09:20.340 --> 09:22.742
Sandra Dee
plus Sandra Day O'Connor?

09:22.809 --> 09:24.977
- Who's Sandra Dee?
- Who's Sandra Day O'Connor?

09:25.045 --> 09:26.379
Forget it.

09:26.446 --> 09:29.148
And I am the Lamplighter,

09:29.216 --> 09:31.517
a character
from my new board game sequel,

09:31.585 --> 09:34.487
"Cones of Dunshire:
Winds of Tremorrah."

09:34.555 --> 09:39.058
Gameplay Magazine called it
"punishingly intricate."

09:39.126 --> 09:40.560
Hey, where are the kids at?

09:40.627 --> 09:42.328
I want to say hi and wrestle
all three of them at once.

09:42.396 --> 09:44.931
Oh, they're trick-or-treating
in Georgetown with some friends.

09:44.998 --> 09:48.067
It's just us grown-ups tonight,
no kids at all.

09:53.841 --> 09:57.144
Hey, Andy, why don't you
give me a hand in the kitchen?

09:58.212 --> 10:00.546
So what do you need
a hand with?

10:00.614 --> 10:03.983
Oh, no, I just thought
you might want to talk.

10:04.051 --> 10:07.053
Whoa.
Dude, that's really slick.

10:07.621 --> 10:10.657
Oh, man, that's some
secret agent stuff right there.

10:10.925 --> 10:13.093
So April's still
on the fence about kids, huh?

10:13.160 --> 10:15.395
Yeah,
and I'm freaking out, man.

10:15.463 --> 10:17.230
I want kids so bad.

10:17.298 --> 10:19.165
You know,
yesterday I was at the park,

10:19.233 --> 10:21.153
and I saw this group
of eight-year-olds laughing,

10:21.202 --> 10:23.103
playing, having a good time.

10:23.170 --> 10:25.238
I almost started crying.

10:25.306 --> 10:26.706
Granted, I'd just face-planted
on my rollerblades.

10:26.774 --> 10:28.174
That's what
they were laughing at.

10:28.242 --> 10:30.143
Sure.

10:30.211 --> 10:32.545
- All right, go ahead.
- What?

10:32.613 --> 10:34.753
You're gonna lecture me about
how Andy and I should have kids.

10:34.782 --> 10:36.149
You're gonna be like,
"They're so great.

10:36.217 --> 10:38.352
"They change your life,
and yes, they drive you nuts,

10:38.419 --> 10:40.754
"but it's all worth it
for the beauty and the majesty

10:40.822 --> 10:42.622
"and the glory of their little
faces in the morning.

10:42.690 --> 10:43.957
Blah, blah, blah, and barf."

10:44.025 --> 10:45.292
You know why it's so unfair?

10:45.360 --> 10:46.827
Because you guys got so lucky.

10:46.894 --> 10:49.029
You had sex one time,
and you had three kids,

10:49.097 --> 10:52.132
and they're all, like,
smart and great and healthy,

10:52.200 --> 10:53.534
and now your lives are perfect.

10:53.601 --> 10:55.035
But our life
is pretty perfect already.

10:55.103 --> 10:57.538
And you know what, kids act
the opposite of their parents.

10:57.605 --> 10:58.939
That's why your kids
are so cool.

10:59.007 --> 11:00.287
But Andy and I are cool already,

11:00.341 --> 11:02.309
so our kids will be,
like, really lame and weird.

11:02.377 --> 11:04.445
I'm sorry.
I just don't know what to do.

11:04.512 --> 11:07.214
Please tell me what to do.
What do I do?

11:07.282 --> 11:09.616
It's not about trying
to make your life perfect.

11:09.684 --> 11:12.286
Nobody's lives are perfect.

11:12.353 --> 11:16.557
You have kids
because you and Andy are a team

11:16.624 --> 11:18.559
and you want to bring in
some new team members.

11:18.626 --> 11:20.494
So you think we should?

11:20.562 --> 11:22.002
I don't know
if you should have kids.

11:22.063 --> 11:23.364
I really don't.

11:23.431 --> 11:26.101
But I do like your team.

11:27.068 --> 11:30.438
All right, Ms. Ludgate,
we're getting close.

11:30.506 --> 11:32.106
Babe, you look
more beautiful right now

11:32.174 --> 11:33.641
than I have ever seen you.

11:34.009 --> 11:35.042
Wow.

11:35.110 --> 11:37.845
Just your luck that you're going
into labor on Halloween.

11:37.913 --> 11:40.281
Can I get a warm towel
to get that makeup off?

11:40.349 --> 11:42.984
No! I want it on!
That's the whole point.

11:43.051 --> 11:45.219
I put the makeup on
after I went into labor.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.854
Whatever blows your skirt up.

11:46.922 --> 11:49.223
Okay, you ready to push?

11:49.291 --> 11:51.792
Wait, no.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.400
Oh, I want to scream,

13:04.200 --> 13:05.600
I know just where to take it,
Ethel,

13:05.635 --> 13:07.736
and I know just the person
who should accompany me.

13:07.804 --> 13:09.171
I'm a little busy right now.

13:09.238 --> 13:10.605
Not you, Kyle.

13:10.673 --> 13:12.474
How many times
did you and I

13:12.542 --> 13:15.343
deliver a form to maintenance
just like this?

13:15.411 --> 13:17.579
Oh, so many great conversations,

13:17.647 --> 13:19.848
bonding and mentoring moments.

13:19.916 --> 13:24.353
It seems only right that we make
this journey one final time.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.422
- What was that, boo-boo?
- Nothing.

13:26.489 --> 13:28.090

Ooh, what are
you two bad larrys up to?

13:33.863 --> 13:35.631
Well, this is our last day
in Pawnee,

13:35.698 --> 13:37.800
and we have one last problem
to fix.

13:37.867 --> 13:39.401
Hold up.
You're leaving?

13:39.469 --> 13:40.536
For truth?

13:40.603 --> 13:43.272
I am gonna miss you so much.

13:43.339 --> 13:44.907
What's going on?
You're not injured?

13:44.974 --> 13:46.575
Uh, yeah, I'm injured.

13:46.643 --> 13:47.743

13:50.346 --> 13:52.381

13:52.449 --> 13:54.850
It's a winter wonderland.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.753
I'm gonna be so sad
to see you go.

13:57.821 --> 14:01.023
Will you do me
one final kindness?

14:01.091 --> 14:04.693
Will you pretend to be my wife
for an insurance scam,

14:04.761 --> 14:07.663
but then we
fall in love for real?

14:07.731 --> 14:09.371
Also, can I have a pair
of your gym socks?

14:09.399 --> 14:10.879
No, wait,
it's not for anything weird.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.535
It's just a fetish I have.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.203
- Jean-Ralphio...
- Yeah.

14:14.271 --> 14:17.573
Although I truly hope
that I never see you again,

14:17.641 --> 14:22.811
I do wish you
a long and happy life.

and testament,

15:14.764 --> 15:19.001
Leslie,
I've always loved you.

15:19.069 --> 15:21.070
I know.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.043
Oh, man!

15:27.111 --> 15:28.991
I forgot that maintenance
was closed on Fridays.

What would

15:32.883 --> 15:35.685
Don't worry, boo-boo, Tommy will
solve this problem no sweat.

15:35.752 --> 15:38.788
Can I just say, Tom,
you have accomplished so much.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.590
You have come so far.
Now you're so successful.

15:41.658 --> 15:43.259
- Don't forget well-dressed.
- Yes.

15:43.327 --> 15:44.427
And well-dressed.

15:44.494 --> 15:46.996
I am so very proud of you.

15:47.064 --> 15:48.631
Thanks, Leslie.

15:48.699 --> 15:50.266
I'm proud of me too.

15:50.334 --> 15:51.567
Nice crooning, buddy.

15:51.635 --> 15:54.203
Uh, the gentleman
by the bar there

15:54.271 --> 15:55.705
sent you over
this glass of wine...

15:55.772 --> 15:58.943
and his business card.

16:00.510 --> 16:03.746
Okay, so as you all know,
Tom's Bistro

16:03.814 --> 16:06.382
has been presented with
a huge expansion opportunity.

16:06.450 --> 16:07.783
I don't want to make a decision
until I hear

16:07.851 --> 16:09.452
from my senior advisory board.

16:09.519 --> 16:11.187
So is this a good idea?

16:11.254 --> 16:13.923
- Accounting Nerd?
- I'm a congressman, Tom.

16:13.991 --> 16:15.358
Can you at least call me "Ben"?

16:15.425 --> 16:16.826
No can do, Accounting Nerd.

16:16.894 --> 16:18.428
We all knew you
before you were a big shot.

16:18.495 --> 16:19.962
Let's keep the whining
to a minimum.

16:20.030 --> 16:22.131
Well, there are always
gonna be risks

16:22.199 --> 16:24.934
when you open new restaurants,
but you've done your homework.

16:25.002 --> 16:26.770
All the numbers line up.

16:26.837 --> 16:28.238
Side note:

16:28.305 --> 16:32.308
I would again strongly recommend
adding calzones to the menu.

16:32.376 --> 16:34.711
Ugh. The worst.
Ron?

16:34.779 --> 16:36.913
It's a bold,
capitalistic gambit, son,

16:36.981 --> 16:38.816
but nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

16:39.383 --> 16:40.650
Regal Meagle?

16:40.718 --> 16:42.152
Real estate is pretty cheap
right now.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.754
If you're gonna do it,
this is a good time.

16:44.822 --> 16:46.723
Okay, I'm doing it.

16:46.791 --> 16:48.024
Over the next five years,

16:48.092 --> 16:51.194
there's gonna be
20 Tom's Bistros across America.

16:51.262 --> 16:54.030
Look out, world,
Tommy's about to blow up.

16:54.098 --> 16:55.165
[explosion]

16:55.233 --> 16:56.633
[English accent]
And blow up he did,

16:56.667 --> 16:58.401
but not in the good way.

16:58.469 --> 17:00.170
He lost everything.

17:00.238 --> 17:04.074
Today, Tom Haverford
is broke, destitute,

17:04.142 --> 17:06.542
and worst of all, swaggerless.

17:06.611 --> 17:08.310
Tommy,
you got to stop watching this.

17:08.378 --> 17:10.146
I can't tear myself away.

17:10.214 --> 17:11.481
It's a whole documentary
about my failures.

17:11.549 --> 17:13.650
That you made.

17:13.718 --> 17:15.219
I had to.

17:15.286 --> 17:18.088
I have to remember every tiny,
awful aspect of this.

17:18.156 --> 17:19.556
I lost everything, Lucy--

17:19.624 --> 17:21.258
The franchises,
most of my money.

17:21.326 --> 17:23.193
I had to sell
my pocket square collection.

17:23.261 --> 17:25.362
What are people's eyes
gonna be drawn to?

17:25.430 --> 17:27.196
Look, you had a tough break.

17:27.265 --> 17:30.033
The stock market tanked,
credit dried up.

17:30.101 --> 17:31.034
Who could have predicted
that the country

17:31.102 --> 17:32.102
would run out of beef?

17:32.170 --> 17:33.904
You just got to move on.

17:33.972 --> 17:35.052
That's the problem, though.

17:35.106 --> 17:36.306
I've gone bust in the past,

17:36.374 --> 17:38.008
but it was because
I did something reckless.

17:38.076 --> 17:39.677
This time
I was smart and careful,

17:39.744 --> 17:40.811
and I still went broke.

17:40.879 --> 17:42.580
What do I do now?

17:42.647 --> 17:44.081
Well,
you and I are gonna be fine,

17:44.149 --> 17:46.817
and you'll come up
with a new idea.

17:46.885 --> 17:49.753
You always do.

17:49.821 --> 17:52.089
I once started
an entertainment company.

17:52.157 --> 17:54.291
It failed in four months.

17:54.359 --> 17:56.327
I opened
a clothing rental store.

17:56.394 --> 17:59.063
I built a restaurant empire.

17:59.131 --> 18:00.631
They all failed,

18:00.699 --> 18:04.635
but the story of America isn't
about second or third chances.

18:04.703 --> 18:10.641
It's about 4th, 5th,
6th, 20th, 50th chances.

18:10.709 --> 18:13.177
That's how long it took me
to get where I am today:

18:13.245 --> 18:15.179
Best-selling author of...

18:15.247 --> 18:18.449
<i>Failure:
An American Success Story.</i>

18:18.517 --> 18:21.519
[applause]

18:26.191 --> 18:27.625
As you know
if you've read the book,

18:27.693 --> 18:31.829
I've outlined seven different
types of successful people.

18:31.897 --> 18:37.535
You can be an Andy,
an April,

18:37.603 --> 18:41.205
a Ben, a Leslie,

18:41.273 --> 18:45.343
a Ron, a Donna,

18:45.411 --> 18:48.179
or my personal favorite, a Tom.

18:48.247 --> 18:51.215
But what do we definitely
not want to be?

18:51.283 --> 18:52.717
All: A Garry!

18:52.785 --> 18:55.119
That's right.
Do not be a Garry.

18:55.187 --> 18:58.423
Oh, he's talking about me!
[laughs]

18:58.791 --> 19:00.291
Hey.

19:00.359 --> 19:02.627
Hey, thanks so much
for coming, guys.

19:02.695 --> 19:03.695
Are you kidding?

19:03.763 --> 19:05.263
Tom, this is incredible.

19:05.331 --> 19:07.665
A best-selling book,
a 40-city tour?

19:07.733 --> 19:09.100
Well, I couldn't have
done it without you.

19:09.168 --> 19:10.869
Well, the book's
called <i>Failure.</i>

19:10.936 --> 19:12.704
- I don't know how to take that.
- I'm serious.

19:12.772 --> 19:14.706
You guys
have always supported me.

19:14.774 --> 19:16.941
Here, I inscribed you a copy.

19:17.009 --> 19:18.476
Oh.

19:18.544 --> 19:20.812
"When I think of success,
I think of you.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.847
"You are a true inspiration
to me.

19:22.915 --> 19:25.350
I love you,
Tom Haverford."

19:25.417 --> 19:28.319
Oh, sorry, that's actually
for Kendrick Lamar.

19:28.387 --> 19:30.255
Here's yours.

19:30.322 --> 19:33.057
"Best wishes."

19:33.125 --> 19:34.626
And I mean every word of it.

19:38.664 --> 19:40.565
So how are we gonna
fix this swing?

19:40.633 --> 19:42.000
Hold a public forum,

19:42.068 --> 19:44.803
have a rally, smash that door,
and do some looting?

19:44.871 --> 19:47.072
Actually, I think
there's a simpler solution.

19:47.140 --> 19:50.210
We just need the help of
the most powerful man in Pawnee.

19:51.477 --> 19:54.379
Jim, how the heck are you?
Yeah, look.

19:54.447 --> 19:56.648
I hate to bother you, but I'm
here with my two best friends,

19:56.716 --> 19:58.350
Leslie Knope
and Tom Haverford...

19:58.418 --> 19:59.985
- [laughs]
- Shh!

20:00.052 --> 20:01.820
And we need the first floor
maintenance room open.

20:01.888 --> 20:04.656
Mm. Okay, great, and best
to Louise and the girls.

20:04.724 --> 20:06.225
Okay, bye-bye.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.427
- You guys are all set.
- Thank you, Mayor Gergich.

20:08.495 --> 20:09.828
You really saved our butts.

20:09.896 --> 20:11.697
I am so happy
that you get to be mayor.

20:11.764 --> 20:12.898
Are you enjoying yourself?

20:12.966 --> 20:14.066
Oh, are you kidding me?

20:14.134 --> 20:16.301
Leslie, I know
that this is purely ceremonial,

20:16.369 --> 20:18.089
and it'll be over
in just a couple of weeks,

20:18.104 --> 20:19.938
but I just don't know
how my life

20:20.006 --> 20:21.306
could get any better than this.

20:21.374 --> 20:24.009
Oh!

20:24.077 --> 20:27.012
In a turn of events
both shocking and unexpected,

20:27.080 --> 20:30.649
interim mayor Garry Gergich
was officially elected today,

20:30.717 --> 20:32.985
thanks to a massive
write-in campaign.

20:33.053 --> 20:34.954
Mayor Gergich,
what are your plans

20:35.021 --> 20:36.388
for your first actual term?

20:36.456 --> 20:37.656
Oh, jeez, you know what?

20:37.724 --> 20:39.058
I have no idea, Perd.

20:39.125 --> 20:40.993
I mean, this is so crazy.

20:41.061 --> 20:42.361
I just hope I do a good job,

20:42.429 --> 20:44.763
and I promise
I'm gonna try my best.

20:44.831 --> 20:48.200
And faithfully serve the people
of Pawnee, Indiana.

20:48.268 --> 20:52.471
As president of City Council,
I, Councilwoman Brandi Maxxxx,

20:52.539 --> 20:56.809
star of more than 11,000 adult
films in the last two years,

20:56.877 --> 21:01.413
officially declare Garry Gergich
Mayor of Pawnee, Indiana,

21:01.481 --> 21:02.615
for the fourth time.

21:02.682 --> 21:04.683
Thank you, Pawnee!

21:04.751 --> 21:06.051
Okay, great.

21:06.119 --> 21:07.820
Garry Gergich,
you are now mayor,

21:07.888 --> 21:11.423
again, for the tenth time,
proving conclusively

21:11.491 --> 21:13.792
that in these corporate states
of America,

21:13.860 --> 21:16.962
it's the entrenched powers
who hold all the cards.

21:17.030 --> 21:18.998
Thank you,
Councilman Morris.

21:19.065 --> 21:21.066
Thank you, Pawnee!

21:21.134 --> 21:25.404
Happy birthday,
my sweet, sweet husband.

21:25.472 --> 21:27.907
We all love you so much.

21:27.975 --> 21:31.043
I have had the perfect life.

21:31.111 --> 21:33.379
I have had
the perfect marriage...

21:33.447 --> 21:35.815
- Oh! [Giggles]
- The perfect children,

21:35.882 --> 21:40.286
and the perfect grandchildren
and great-grandchildren!

21:40.354 --> 21:44.023
And I just want you to know
how much I love you.

21:44.091 --> 21:47.226
Okay, come on, everybody,
say, "Gergich!"

21:47.294 --> 21:51.130
All: Gergich!
[camera shutter clicks]

21:51.198 --> 21:55.034
Mayor Garry Gergich
died peacefully in his sleep

21:55.102 --> 21:57.036
on his 100th birthday,

21:57.104 --> 22:00.973
holding the hand
of his beloved wife, Gayle.

22:01.041 --> 22:04.243
Man, Gayle looks amazing.

22:04.311 --> 22:05.645
Yeah, yeah.
I know.

22:05.712 --> 22:06.946
He will now be given

22:07.014 --> 22:10.883
the Indiana Notary Society's
highest honor,

22:10.951 --> 22:12.618
the 21-Stamp Salute.

22:20.160 --> 22:23.596
Oh, rest in peace, friend.

22:23.664 --> 22:26.899
They spelled his name wrong
on the tombstone.

22:28.635 --> 22:32.538
- Eh, close enough.
- Eh.

22:32.606 --> 22:34.507
It's time to go.

22:37.433 --> 22:39.734
Okay.
How's this for a headline?

22:39.801 --> 22:42.937
"Still Swinging: Parks Gang
Reunites for One Last Bang."

22:43.005 --> 22:44.405
That's a little dirty.

22:44.473 --> 22:46.574
Well, it's a headline, Shauna.
Sex sells.

22:46.642 --> 22:47.875
Knope,

22:47.943 --> 22:50.945
make yourself useful and hand me
that crescent wrench.

22:51.013 --> 22:54.615
Oh,
not bad craftsmanship, Ron.

22:54.683 --> 22:56.585
It is perfect craftsmanship.

22:58.253 --> 23:01.323
I calculate the cost
of my labor at $38.

23:02.091 --> 23:04.859
I can send the bill to you?

23:04.927 --> 23:07.161
So you think you're
gonna stick around Pawnee?

23:07.229 --> 23:08.930
Oh, I imagine so.

23:08.998 --> 23:11.332
Not sure where
I would go, really.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.335
Well, we're gonna
come back here a lot.

23:14.403 --> 23:16.339
You know what they say.

23:17.706 --> 23:19.642
Don't be a stranger.

23:20.910 --> 23:23.111
Despite the recent
financial crisis,

23:23.179 --> 23:27.048
Very Good Building Company
will finish fiscal year 2022

23:27.116 --> 23:29.985
in excellent financial shape,
thanks in large part

23:30.052 --> 23:32.821
to the stewardship
of your chairman, Ron Swanson.

23:32.888 --> 23:35.657
Mr. Chairman, would you like
to say a few words?

23:39.495 --> 23:42.764
I resign as chairman,
effective immediately.

23:42.832 --> 23:45.734
Uh, would you
like to explain why?

23:45.801 --> 23:47.268
No.

23:47.336 --> 23:49.671
Should we discuss
your retirement package?

23:49.739 --> 23:51.906
Just give me whatever
the board thinks is fair.

23:51.974 --> 23:54.876
- Agreed.
- Best of luck.

23:54.944 --> 23:57.512
Don't get emotional, Vaughn.
You're embarrassing yourself.

24:00.116 --> 24:02.050
What just happened?

24:05.488 --> 24:07.689
Ron, your family is beautiful.

24:07.757 --> 24:09.625
They're a handsome bunch.

24:09.692 --> 24:13.128
Diane and I are especially proud
because Ivy was just accepted

24:13.196 --> 24:14.196
at Stanford University.

24:14.197 --> 24:15.364
Wow.

24:15.432 --> 24:16.665
Yeah, it's gonna cost
an arm and a leg.

24:16.733 --> 24:18.000
You take my advice?

24:18.067 --> 24:19.501
I did.
Thank you, again.

24:19.569 --> 24:20.903
I sold some of my gold

24:20.970 --> 24:23.973
and officially diversified
my portfolio.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.508
Congratulations.

24:25.575 --> 24:28.110
You now own 51%
of the Lagavulin Distillery.

24:28.178 --> 24:29.538
Pleasure doing business
with you.

24:29.546 --> 24:30.646
And with you.

24:30.714 --> 24:32.216
All: <i>Sláinte.</i>

24:33.984 --> 24:36.854
So, Ron,
what brings you here?

24:38.522 --> 24:41.357
I am at something
of a personal crossroads.

24:41.425 --> 24:43.960
Yes!
I love personal crossroads.

24:44.027 --> 24:47.964
I once made the mistake of not
talking to you at such a moment,

24:48.031 --> 24:51.067
and I do not intend
to repeat that error.

24:51.134 --> 24:52.535
Well, let's take a walk.

24:52.603 --> 24:55.372
There's a cute,
little park nearby.

24:56.440 --> 24:58.975
I suppose I had simply

24:59.042 --> 25:00.910
accomplished everything
I wanted to,

25:00.978 --> 25:04.013
and there seemed to be
little point in continuing.

25:04.081 --> 25:06.849
So what do you want to do now?

25:06.917 --> 25:08.584
Well, that's the problem.

25:08.652 --> 25:10.119
I'm not sure.

25:10.187 --> 25:12.088
My kids are growing up.

25:12.156 --> 25:14.991
My days in an office
feel like a waste.

25:15.059 --> 25:20.029
I would like to turn
my attention to something...

25:20.097 --> 25:23.099
that would make me feel useful,

25:23.167 --> 25:27.804
but for the life of me,
I cannot figure out what.

25:27.871 --> 25:31.474
And there are not many people--

25:31.542 --> 25:34.044
I mean, we were workplace
proximity acquaintances

25:34.111 --> 25:36.479
for many years,
and so I thought--

25:36.547 --> 25:37.614
I thought maybe...

25:37.682 --> 25:40.216
Say no more, you big softie.

25:40.284 --> 25:42.285
I'm gonna spend
every waking moment

25:42.353 --> 25:44.388
trying to figure this out
for you.

25:45.456 --> 25:46.389
You want to stay for dinner?

25:46.457 --> 25:47.924
- We're having steak.
- Mm?

25:47.992 --> 25:49.592
But we're also hosting
several members

25:49.660 --> 25:51.595
of the House Subcommittee
on Foreign Affairs.

25:51.662 --> 25:54.031
I'll take that steak to go,
please and thank you.

25:59.537 --> 26:03.307
Hey, there you are.
Thanks for meeting me here.

26:03.374 --> 26:04.374
Well, if you'd have
held them here

26:04.442 --> 26:05.576
instead of that conference room,

26:05.643 --> 26:07.377
I would have come
to more meetings.

26:07.445 --> 26:10.748
I got to tell you, Leslie,
establishing this national park

26:10.815 --> 26:14.518
right next to Pawnee
is quite an accomplishment.

26:14.586 --> 26:16.820
This is a fine piece of land
you saved.

26:16.888 --> 26:18.722
Thank you, Ron.

26:18.790 --> 26:21.058
You want to run it?

26:21.126 --> 26:23.594
The superintendent
of Bryce Canyon retired,

26:23.661 --> 26:25.596
and I convinced
the superintendent of this park

26:25.663 --> 26:27.731
to transfer,
shuffled a few things around.

26:27.799 --> 26:29.967
The point is someone needs
to take care of this place now.

26:30.034 --> 26:31.902
Thought it should be you.

26:31.970 --> 26:33.571
I...

26:34.639 --> 26:36.206
Well, first of all,
I would be working

26:36.274 --> 26:37.574
for the federal government.

26:37.642 --> 26:40.010
Your job would be
to walk around the land alone,

26:40.078 --> 26:41.979
you'd live in the same town
you've always lived in,

26:42.046 --> 26:43.347
you'd work outside,
you'd talk to bears.

26:43.414 --> 26:44.615
Next argument?

26:44.683 --> 26:46.951
There must be dozens of people
gunning for this job.

26:47.018 --> 26:49.320
I wouldn't want you
to ruffle any feathers.

26:49.387 --> 26:50.554
Am I even qualified?

26:50.622 --> 26:52.223
Well, a few people
might be annoyed,

26:52.290 --> 26:53.324
but they'll get over it.

26:53.391 --> 26:55.125
And as far
as your qualifications,

26:55.193 --> 26:56.595
you're Ron Swanson.

26:57.662 --> 26:59.665
Stop being a dummy and accept.

27:00.932 --> 27:03.000
- When do I start?
- Oh, today.

27:03.068 --> 27:04.268
I already accepted for you.

27:04.336 --> 27:06.704
I still remember
how to forge your signature.

27:06.771 --> 27:08.274
Let's go meet your staff.

27:10.542 --> 27:12.376
Pawnee National Park rangers,

27:12.444 --> 27:16.381
this is Ron Swanson, your new
superintendent and boss.

27:17.449 --> 27:22.253
Rangers, my name
is Ronald Ulysses Swanson.

27:22.321 --> 27:26.190
Your job and mine
is to walk this land

27:26.258 --> 27:28.426
and make sure no one harms it.

27:28.493 --> 27:31.295
If you show up on time,
speak honestly,

27:31.363 --> 27:32.997
and treat everyone
with fairness,

27:33.065 --> 27:35.733
we will get along just fine.

27:35.801 --> 27:37.268
Though hopefully not too fine,

27:37.336 --> 27:39.770
as I'm not looking
for any new friends.

27:39.838 --> 27:41.339
End of speech.

27:41.406 --> 27:42.807
Well said.

27:45.945 --> 27:48.613
Thank you, Leslie.

27:48.681 --> 27:50.882
You're welcome, Ron.

27:55.087 --> 27:56.988
Okay.

27:57.056 --> 27:58.690
Time to go to work.

28:17.609 --> 28:19.711
♪

28:24.116 --> 28:26.351
Well, I have to make
a couple more adjustments.

28:30.556 --> 28:32.123
Babe,
I don't want to seem dramatic,

28:32.191 --> 28:34.058
but I've just reconsidered
every decision

28:34.126 --> 28:35.393
that we've made
over the last year,

28:35.461 --> 28:37.595
and I think we need
to stay in Pawnee forever.

28:37.663 --> 28:39.030
- I know.
- [sighs]

28:39.098 --> 28:40.264
But we have to pick up
the kids,

28:40.332 --> 28:41.432
and we have a flight to catch.

28:41.500 --> 28:42.967
But when is this group
of people

28:43.035 --> 28:45.136
ever going to be
all together again?

28:45.204 --> 28:46.738
That's all I want,

28:46.805 --> 28:49.440
all of these people in
the same place at the same time.

28:49.508 --> 28:51.409
It'll happen someday.

28:51.477 --> 28:53.077
What's gonna happen
between now and then?

28:53.145 --> 28:56.981
A lot,
and it's all gonna be great.

28:57.049 --> 28:58.916
- You promise?
- I promise.

29:05.791 --> 29:07.392
This is a nice house.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.494
You say that every time
we're here.

29:09.562 --> 29:10.695
I'm just trying
to distract you,

29:10.763 --> 29:12.764
so you don't have
a nervous breakdown.

29:12.832 --> 29:14.599
I think I am past that point.

29:14.667 --> 29:15.867
You don't have to worry
about me anymore.

29:15.935 --> 29:17.736
Hey, folks, welcome back.

29:17.803 --> 29:19.971
Great to have so many
good friends and colleagues.

29:20.039 --> 29:22.707
We're looking forward to a great
conversation and a good dinner.

29:22.775 --> 29:26.444
As usual, there's only
one rule: No shop talk.

29:26.512 --> 29:28.213
So if you want
to discuss politics,

29:28.280 --> 29:30.215
you're gonna have to wait
until after dinner.

29:30.282 --> 29:31.783
I'm looking at you, Leslie.

29:31.851 --> 29:34.986
Okay, well, as long as we get
to play charades later.

29:35.054 --> 29:36.921
- [chuckles]
- Okay.

29:36.989 --> 29:40.158
Last time we played charades,
she spent 3 1/2 hours here.

29:40.226 --> 29:41.546
You're just mad
'cause you lost.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.294
Oh, come on.

29:48.972 --> 29:51.040
Damn!
That food was good.

29:51.108 --> 29:52.708
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again--

29:52.776 --> 29:55.478
Joe Biden knows his way
around a seafood risotto.

29:55.545 --> 29:57.313
You've said that before?

29:57.381 --> 30:00.516
Anyway, the point is, yes,
I do like working at Interior.

30:00.584 --> 30:03.085
I love it, but I'm always
looking for new challenges.

30:03.153 --> 30:04.420
Why do you ask?

30:04.488 --> 30:06.556
There's a rumor
the governor of Indiana

30:06.623 --> 30:09.525
isn't going to run again,
and my friends at the DNC

30:09.593 --> 30:12.762
are very interested in you
as a candidate.

30:12.830 --> 30:15.198
- For governor of Indiana?
- Mm-hmm.

30:15.265 --> 30:17.425
Someone's been reading
my kindergarten dream journal.

30:17.434 --> 30:18.735
So what do you think?

30:18.802 --> 30:20.269
I'll call you next week,
and we can talk about it?

30:20.337 --> 30:22.739
O-okay, great.

30:22.806 --> 30:24.540
Well, this is exciting.

30:24.608 --> 30:26.042
I'm gonna take this energy,

30:26.110 --> 30:28.044
and I'm gonna go crush Joe Biden
in charades.

30:28.612 --> 30:30.515
Dr. Jill, let's pick teams.

30:32.783 --> 30:34.384
Oh.
Move.

30:34.652 --> 30:36.719
Need the congressman.
This is time-sensitive.

30:36.787 --> 30:38.755
Hey, Jen,
I didn't know you were here.

30:38.823 --> 30:39.856
I'm everywhere.

30:39.924 --> 30:41.791
You want to be
governor of Indiana?

30:42.359 --> 30:43.259
What?

30:43.327 --> 30:44.761
Colquitt's not gonna
run again.

30:44.829 --> 30:46.529
It's a rumor for now,
but my gut says it's for real.

30:46.597 --> 30:47.997
You're the perfect candidate.

30:48.065 --> 30:50.166
Local hero,
state government experience,

30:50.234 --> 30:51.768
blah-blah-blah-
blah-blah-blah-blah.

30:51.836 --> 30:53.203
I mean,
the only potential problem

30:53.270 --> 30:55.805
is that devastatingly nerdy
"Cones of Dunshire" thing.

30:55.873 --> 30:57.707
Uh, that's a problem?

30:57.775 --> 30:59.042
I'm sorry,

30:59.109 --> 31:01.211
but it's the ninth-highest
selling multiplayer

31:01.278 --> 31:06.049
figurine-based strategy
fantasy sequel game in history.

31:06.116 --> 31:08.718
Please don't bail on me
because of what just happened.

31:11.355 --> 31:12.155
Both: So...

31:12.223 --> 31:13.623
I had a pretty interesting
conversation

31:13.691 --> 31:14.971
with Janet from the DNC tonight.

31:15.026 --> 31:16.159
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

31:16.227 --> 31:18.028
She said
that Governor Colquitt

31:18.095 --> 31:19.829
might be stepping down,

31:19.897 --> 31:23.266
and the DNC thinks
that I should run for governor.

31:23.334 --> 31:27.804
Oh, God.
That... kind of sucks.

31:27.872 --> 31:29.139
Really? Why?

31:29.207 --> 31:30.974
No. I mean, that's--

31:31.042 --> 31:32.209
That's amazing.

31:32.277 --> 31:36.513
It's just, Jen Barkley kind of
approached me about running.

31:36.581 --> 31:38.883
Oh!
Oh.

31:39.951 --> 31:42.786
Well, I mean, obviously...

31:44.689 --> 31:46.056
Right.
Yeah, no, no.

31:46.124 --> 31:47.157
I mean, obviously...

31:47.225 --> 31:49.026
Yeah, I mean, obviously...

31:52.397 --> 31:54.632
Okay, pros of you
running for governor:

31:54.699 --> 31:56.533
You would be a great governor,

31:56.601 --> 31:58.168
we could make Pawnee
our home base,

31:58.236 --> 31:59.770
kids could go to school
in Pawnee,

31:59.838 --> 32:02.039
and it would be
a huge career move for you.

32:02.107 --> 32:05.275
The pros of me running
for governor are the same thing.

32:05.343 --> 32:06.777
- It's the same list.
- Right.

32:06.845 --> 32:08.779
The only con of you running
would be

32:08.847 --> 32:11.015
that I don't get to run
and vice versa.

32:13.084 --> 32:14.785
Good.
So we've solved it.

32:14.853 --> 32:16.687
[groans] Ugh.
Look.

32:16.755 --> 32:18.195
We're going back
to Pawnee in a week.

32:18.223 --> 32:20.091
Why don't we just
talk about it after that?

32:20.158 --> 32:21.459
Good idea.

32:21.526 --> 32:23.260
Hey, maybe we can drop by
the old stomping ground,

32:23.328 --> 32:25.429
see how the Parks Department
has changed.

32:25.497 --> 32:26.497
I love it.

32:26.565 --> 32:28.199
Okay, are you ready?

32:28.266 --> 32:30.468
No, but we don't have
a choice, do we?

32:30.535 --> 32:31.535
[sighs]

32:31.603 --> 32:33.471
Kids, dinner!

32:33.538 --> 32:35.738
Hey, I'm gonna eat in my room
because I have to study.

32:35.774 --> 32:36.774
Can we go to Bobby's house
to watch the game?

32:36.842 --> 32:38.075
Hey, dude, stop.

32:38.143 --> 32:39.310
- Did you finish your homework?
- Yes, all of it.

32:39.378 --> 32:40.611
- Okay, don't forget to...
- That's mine.

32:40.679 --> 32:41.812
- We'll be back by 8:00.
- Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.280
- Bye.
- Okay, get your ice skates!

32:43.348 --> 32:44.448
- You have a lesson tomorrow!
- Bye, Mom.

32:44.516 --> 32:45.750
- Bye, Dad.
- Just-okay.

32:45.817 --> 32:47.420
Bye.
[door closes]

32:49.688 --> 32:52.256
- Want some broccoli?
- Ugh, no.

32:53.425 --> 32:54.859
You know, now that I'm here,

32:54.927 --> 32:57.728
it's giving me an idea
about this governor thing.

32:57.796 --> 32:59.897
Maybe we need fresh eyes,
you know,

32:59.965 --> 33:01.365
other people to weigh in.

33:01.433 --> 33:06.270
We should talk to Ron or Tom
or April or Donna or Andy even.

33:06.338 --> 33:08.406
- Sometimes he can be wise.
- Oh, good idea.

33:08.474 --> 33:10.074
Let's call them.

33:10.142 --> 33:11.709
Or you know what else
we could do?

33:11.777 --> 33:13.344
Just talk to them in person.

33:13.412 --> 33:16.214
All: Hey!

33:16.281 --> 33:18.916
Surprise!

33:18.984 --> 33:20.485
Oh, wow.

33:20.552 --> 33:21.672
It's what you wanted, right,

33:21.687 --> 33:24.155
everyone in the same room
at same time?

33:24.223 --> 33:26.491
I can't believe you.

33:26.558 --> 33:29.994
We're all here together
in the same room...

33:30.062 --> 33:33.097
in this room.

33:33.165 --> 33:35.733
I don't think
I could be happier right now.

33:35.801 --> 33:36.801
Want to bet?

33:36.869 --> 33:39.070
- Hi.
- Oh, Ann's here!

33:39.138 --> 33:40.938
Ann.
Ann's here!

33:41.006 --> 33:42.340
- Hi!
- Oh!

33:42.407 --> 33:43.541
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

33:43.609 --> 33:45.243
- How you doing?
- Oh, good.

33:45.310 --> 33:47.178
- You guys, Ann's here.
- Aww.

33:47.246 --> 33:48.646
- Should we move away from here?
- Yeah, yeah.

33:48.714 --> 33:51.315
- This could go on for some time.
- Ohh!

33:55.707 --> 33:57.043
Your hair looks amazing,
by the way.

33:57.211 --> 33:58.644
You look like
a cartoon princess.

33:58.712 --> 34:00.880
Oh, thank you! That's from the pills
I was telling you about.

34:00.948 --> 34:02.115
I took some of those,

34:02.182 --> 34:03.349
but I don't know,
they didn't do anything,

34:03.417 --> 34:04.751
and they kind of upset
my stomach.

34:04.818 --> 34:06.185
No, no, no.
You're supposed to crack them

34:06.253 --> 34:08.288
and leave them on your hair
overnight, not eat them.

34:08.355 --> 34:09.822
Oh, no.

34:09.889 --> 34:12.458
Well, it's confusing
'cause they're delicious.

34:12.525 --> 34:14.728
Because my first book
was such a smash,

34:14.795 --> 34:16.835
I had to come up with
a new angle for the follow-up.

34:16.897 --> 34:19.866
Then it hit me...
Failure 2.0: Failing to Fail.

34:19.934 --> 34:21.601
- Love it.
- How's everything?

34:21.668 --> 34:23.708
You properly treating yourself
out there in Seattle?

34:23.771 --> 34:24.838
In a manner of speaking.

34:24.906 --> 34:26.672
Joe and I spend most of our time
on the foundation.

34:26.741 --> 34:27.835
[sighs]

34:27.860 --> 34:29.433
I can't believe
you went nonprofit.

34:29.476 --> 34:30.444
I mean, I love you.

34:30.512 --> 34:31.844
You're one of my best friends,

34:31.913 --> 34:34.014
but you have betrayed me
and everything we stand for.

34:34.081 --> 34:35.815
- You've changed.
- Maybe you're right.

34:35.884 --> 34:37.918
By the way, what time is it?

34:37.985 --> 34:40.454
Oh, it looks like
it's half past spla-Dow!

34:40.522 --> 34:41.755
Both: What?

34:41.822 --> 34:43.056
I take it all back.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.324
That's a lot of diamonds.

34:44.391 --> 34:46.112
Give me, give me, give me,
give me, give me!

34:46.161 --> 34:48.862
Hey, Oliver.
Hey, Leslie.

34:48.929 --> 34:50.630
- Hello, Ann.
- Hi, April.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.833
Your kids are,
like, surprisingly awesome.

34:52.900 --> 34:53.900
Thank you.

34:53.902 --> 34:55.135
Did you use an egg donor

34:55.203 --> 34:57.571
or give Chris a hall pass
for a night?

34:57.639 --> 35:00.140
Once again,
they are my biological children.

35:00.208 --> 35:02.276
Once again,
I don't believe you.

35:02.344 --> 35:05.913
Ann, you rainbow-infused
space unicorn.

35:05.981 --> 35:09.483
Ann, you beautiful,
sassy mannequin come to life.

35:09.551 --> 35:11.886
Ann, you opalescent tree shark.

35:11.954 --> 35:14.355
Leslie, you are the master
of the metaphor.

35:14.423 --> 35:15.756
Oh.

35:15.824 --> 35:18.192
I recently compared her
to a nutrient-rich chia seed.

35:18.260 --> 35:19.427
What's that thing
on your wrist?

35:19.494 --> 35:20.995
Oh!

35:21.063 --> 35:23.397
[electronic tones]

35:23.465 --> 35:25.633
You are extremely healthy.

35:25.701 --> 35:28.402
I do that literally
50 times a day.

35:28.470 --> 35:31.639
Aren't you afraid that thing
might give you cancer?

35:31.707 --> 35:33.274
Well, I am now.

35:33.342 --> 35:35.276
Well, there he is.

35:35.344 --> 35:38.112
Chip Traeger,
you old son of a gun.

35:38.180 --> 35:39.647
Andy, it's Chris.

35:39.715 --> 35:41.816
Is it?

35:41.883 --> 35:43.251
Ha! Huh.

35:43.319 --> 35:46.454
Hello, Jack.
Ron Swanson.

35:46.522 --> 35:47.789
Strong handshake.

35:47.856 --> 35:49.657
- Well done, you two.
- Thank you.

35:49.725 --> 35:51.392
So are you
gonna have another one?

35:51.460 --> 35:53.494
Um...

35:53.562 --> 35:55.063
[gasps]

35:55.130 --> 35:57.399
- Shh.
- Shh.

35:58.567 --> 36:01.135
'Cause--
'cause he's sleeping?

36:01.203 --> 36:02.670
How can you tell?

36:02.738 --> 36:04.172
Oh,
it's a common misconception

36:04.239 --> 36:06.007
that the Oculus
holds all of the power.

36:06.075 --> 36:07.342
It's actually the Lamplighter.

36:07.409 --> 36:09.143
Ann! Oh, my God!
It's happening.

36:09.211 --> 36:11.840
It's totally happening.
Our kids are falling in love.

36:11.847 --> 36:13.248
This is good.
Okay, remember.

36:13.315 --> 36:15.550
If this is ever gonna work, we
have to pretend to disapprove.

36:15.618 --> 36:17.519
Yeah, right, good call.

36:17.586 --> 36:18.987
Hey!

36:19.055 --> 36:20.355
- Leslie, no.
- Oh.

36:20.423 --> 36:23.058
Who cares?

36:23.125 --> 36:25.894
Ann Arbor, Michigan,
is literally the greatest city

36:25.961 --> 36:27.796
that I have ever lived in,

36:27.863 --> 36:30.231
but Pawnee is better,
so we're moving back.

36:30.299 --> 36:31.466
- That's great.
- Yeah.

36:31.534 --> 36:33.535
I'm gonna run admissions
at Indiana.

36:33.602 --> 36:35.270
I'm trading Wolverines
for Hoosiers.

36:35.337 --> 36:37.773
Well, you're getting
the better end of that deal.

36:38.441 --> 36:39.841
Tom!

36:39.909 --> 36:42.911
I took the quiz in your book
about what kind of person I am.

36:42.979 --> 36:44.112
I'm a "Ron."

36:44.180 --> 36:45.881
Ha!
I'm usually a "Tom,"

36:45.948 --> 36:47.716
but sometimes I'm a "Donna."

36:47.784 --> 36:49.785
Last time I took it,
I was a "Tom."

36:49.852 --> 36:52.621
What?
No.

36:52.688 --> 36:53.822
No, no, no!

36:53.890 --> 36:55.357
Take it again!

36:55.424 --> 36:57.626
I got to go recalibrate
the quiz.

37:02.213 --> 37:05.550
♪ Things I really want to do

37:06.518 --> 37:08.185
So did anyone
have any insights

37:08.253 --> 37:09.854
on our "running for governor"
situation?

37:10.122 --> 37:11.842
I've been so busy
catching up with everyone,

37:11.890 --> 37:13.250
I haven't had a chance
to ask them.

37:13.258 --> 37:14.759
- Yeah, me neither.
- Okay, here's what I think.

37:14.826 --> 37:16.460
I hate
when we're on opposite sides.

37:16.528 --> 37:18.195
It stinks.

37:18.263 --> 37:20.531
Plus, if one of us runs,
it doesn't mean we're gonna win.

37:20.599 --> 37:23.134
Right, and it's not like
this is the only career option

37:23.201 --> 37:24.335
for either of us.

37:24.402 --> 37:26.570
So all that matters
is that we are good.

37:26.638 --> 37:29.507
Right,
which is why I have an idea.

37:29.574 --> 37:32.042
I think we should flip a coin.
I mean it.

37:32.110 --> 37:35.346
Let's literally flip a coin,
because whoever runs

37:35.413 --> 37:38.115
is gonna do a great job,
and whoever doesn't run

37:38.183 --> 37:40.718
is gonna be right alongside
the other one,

37:40.786 --> 37:43.454
offering advice and support
and whatever they need.

37:43.522 --> 37:44.688
So it doesn't matter.

37:44.756 --> 37:46.157
So let's flip a coin.

37:46.224 --> 37:48.125
Okay, you, Leslie Knope,

37:48.193 --> 37:52.530
the queen of planning and
binders and pro-and-con lists,

37:52.597 --> 37:55.866
you want to leave this
to chance?

37:55.934 --> 38:01.572
Yes, because whatever's next,
you and I are in it together.

38:01.640 --> 38:04.041
So let's go tell everybody,
and they can participate,

38:04.109 --> 38:05.876
and they can sign the coin,
and then, you know, the coin

38:05.944 --> 38:08.648
will eventually make its way
into the Smithsonian.

38:10.566 --> 38:12.500
Okay, everybody, gather around.

38:12.568 --> 38:15.269
First of all, I just have to say
that all of you in the same room

38:15.337 --> 38:16.938
at the same time
with your children here,

38:17.005 --> 38:18.339
it's like
it's the greatest thing

38:18.407 --> 38:20.247
that's ever happened
in the history of America.

38:20.309 --> 38:22.744
And secondly,
Ben and I have an announcement.

38:22.811 --> 38:25.113
Leslie's running
for governor of Indiana.

38:25.180 --> 38:27.982
All: What?

38:28.050 --> 38:29.384
Bully for you, Knope.

38:29.452 --> 38:30.552
That's amazing.

38:30.619 --> 38:32.253
Yeah, she got approached
by the DNC,

38:32.321 --> 38:34.422
and they think she has
a great shot to win.

38:34.490 --> 38:37.258
Indiana native,
supremely qualified,

38:37.326 --> 38:39.928
and she wrote
that she wanted to be governor

38:39.995 --> 38:42.764
in her kindergarten
dream journal.

38:42.832 --> 38:45.533
Just makes sense.

38:48.638 --> 38:49.938
So I'm running for governor.

38:50.006 --> 38:51.640
All: Yeah!

38:51.707 --> 38:53.408
Ben is gonna be
running my campaign

38:53.476 --> 38:54.843
because he's a super genius,

38:54.911 --> 38:57.879
and he's got a tight,
compact, little body

38:57.947 --> 39:00.882
like an Italian sports car.

39:00.950 --> 39:03.151
But right now I'd like
to make a toast.

39:03.219 --> 39:06.555
When we worked here together,

39:06.622 --> 39:10.258
we fought, scratched,
and clawed

39:10.326 --> 39:13.128
to make people's lives
a tiny bit better.

39:13.196 --> 39:15.797
That's what public service
is all about--

39:15.865 --> 39:18.533
Small, incremental change
every day.

39:18.601 --> 39:20.869
Teddy Roosevelt once said,

39:20.937 --> 39:24.005
"Far and away, the best prize
that life has to offer

39:24.073 --> 39:27.809
is a chance to work hard
at work worth doing."

39:27.877 --> 39:32.214
And I would add
that what makes work worth doing

39:32.281 --> 39:34.917
is getting to do it
with people that you love.

39:34.984 --> 39:37.452
I started my career
more than 30 years ago

39:37.520 --> 39:38.921
in the Parks and Recreation
Department

39:38.988 --> 39:41.423
right here in Pawnee, Indiana.

39:41.491 --> 39:43.659
I've had a lot
of different jobs

39:43.726 --> 39:46.028
including two terms
as your governor,

39:46.095 --> 39:50.265
and soon a new,
unknown challenge awaits me,

39:50.333 --> 39:54.536
which to me, even now,
is thrilling

39:54.604 --> 39:55.837
because I love the work.

39:55.905 --> 39:58.473
Not to say that public service
isn't sexy,

39:58.541 --> 40:00.676
because it definitely is,

40:00.744 --> 40:03.679
but that's not why we do it.

40:03.747 --> 40:05.414
We do it
because we get the chance

40:05.482 --> 40:09.151
to work hard
at work worth doing...

40:09.219 --> 40:12.488
alongside a team of people
we love.

40:12.555 --> 40:17.626
So I thank those people
who've walked with me,

40:17.694 --> 40:20.629
and I thank you for this honor.

40:20.697 --> 40:23.098
Now, go find your team,
and get to work.

40:23.166 --> 40:25.234
[applause]

40:29.606 --> 40:31.674
In addition to Governor
Knope's honorary doctorate

40:31.742 --> 40:33.509
from the School
of Public Policy,

40:33.577 --> 40:37.179
in recognition of all she's done
for the people of Indiana,

40:37.247 --> 40:41.417
the campus library
will henceforth bear her name.

40:41.485 --> 40:43.919
[applause]

40:43.987 --> 40:47.189
[under breath]
A [bleep] library?

40:50.160 --> 40:52.995
Yeah, that should do it.
The swing is fixed.

40:53.063 --> 40:55.498
- Yeah!
- All right.

40:55.565 --> 40:57.666
Well, there you have it, sir.

40:57.734 --> 41:00.036
Another problem solved
by the hard work

41:00.103 --> 41:02.638
of dedicated public servants.

41:02.706 --> 41:04.740
Okay, great.

41:04.808 --> 41:06.342
Bye.

41:06.410 --> 41:08.477
Yeah, that's about right.

41:08.545 --> 41:10.546
Okay, well...

41:10.614 --> 41:12.615
[sighs]

41:12.682 --> 41:13.682
Hang on.

41:13.683 --> 41:14.950
Gayle made me promise

41:15.018 --> 41:17.019
to get a quick picture
just for old times' sake.

41:17.087 --> 41:19.223
Good idea.
Garry had a good idea.

41:20.290 --> 41:21.657
Oh, the lighting's all wrong.

41:21.725 --> 41:23.045
I'm gonna
send you a glamour shot.

41:23.060 --> 41:24.293
Just Photoshop me in later.

41:24.361 --> 41:25.862
I'm not gonna show up
in that picture anyway

41:25.929 --> 41:27.263
because I'm a vampire.

41:27.331 --> 41:29.531
Hey, babe, for this picture,
should I be Burt Macklin,

41:29.566 --> 41:31.968
Johnny Karate,
or my new character,

41:32.035 --> 41:34.637
Sergeant Thunderfist, MD?

41:34.705 --> 41:35.972
Where did you get that?

41:36.039 --> 41:37.159
I found it in the sandbox.

41:37.207 --> 41:38.341
Ew!

41:38.408 --> 41:39.642
Go Macklin.

41:39.710 --> 41:41.611
- Macklin's the hottest.
- Get on with it.

41:41.678 --> 41:43.813
I can't hold this smile forever.
I look ridiculous.

41:43.925 --> 41:45.826
Okay, hang on.
Okay.

41:45.860 --> 41:48.993
[camera beeping]

41:49.027 --> 41:50.533
You ready, babe?

41:52.067 --> 41:53.270
Yes.

41:55.204 --> 41:56.366
I'm ready.
