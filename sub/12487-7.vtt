WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:05.504
Listen up, guys.

00:05.605 --> 00:09.008
    This is a bye week so you
    all know what that means.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.610
    No games and no practice
    for the rest of the week.

00:11.711 --> 00:13.812
- Don't get too excited.

00:13.913 --> 00:16.648
I know you knuckleheads get into
 trouble when you have time off.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.584
  So I'm keeping my eye on you.

00:21.521 --> 00:24.089
 - So, Bella, are you gonna use
        bye week to braid

00:24.190 --> 00:26.191
    your girly friends' hair
     and have pillow fights?

00:26.292 --> 00:27.726
  - What are you talking about?

00:27.827 --> 00:30.229
    - Sorry, I've never been
   friends with a girl before.

00:30.330 --> 00:33.665
      - You have a sister.
      - We're not friends.

00:36.336 --> 00:38.170
 - Anyway, Sophie and Pepper are
    going to a cheer retreat,

00:38.271 --> 00:40.305
      so I'm going to have
         some 'me' time.

00:40.407 --> 00:41.673
   Do you guys have any plans?

00:41.775 --> 00:43.909
          - We do--ooo.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.644
             - Okay.

00:45.745 --> 00:49.281
    - But we can't tell you.
 It's a super secret tradition.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.684
     - Ooh, that sounds fun.
         I like secrets.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.087
 - Look, Bella, we'd be happy to
     invite you to join us,

00:55.188 --> 00:56.655
         but we can't--

00:56.756 --> 00:59.992
    because we don't want to.

01:00.093 --> 01:02.294
    - Guys, I got the funnel
            for the--

01:02.395 --> 01:06.131
   thing that we're definitely
     not doing Friday night.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.001
     - Relax, I was curious,
          not obsessed.

01:09.102 --> 01:10.803
     Anyway, I've gotta go.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.072
   Kyle always seems to be in
   the hallway after practice

01:13.173 --> 01:15.107
      and I'm gonna pretend
        to bump into him.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.643
         He is so cute!

01:21.181 --> 01:23.048
     Oh, Kyle, you're here.

01:23.149 --> 01:25.417
      I didn't expect that.
             - Yeah.

01:25.518 --> 01:26.785
        I've been taking
       this route because

01:26.886 --> 01:28.587
  it's easier to get to my bus

01:28.688 --> 01:30.589
    and the really good water
     fountain is over here.

01:30.690 --> 01:33.392
  And, uh, do you wanna go out
     with me tomorrow night?

01:33.493 --> 01:35.694
             - Yeah!

01:35.795 --> 01:38.464
      Uh, that sounds cool.

01:38.565 --> 01:41.400
     - So, uh, where do you
      wanna go on our date?

01:41.501 --> 01:45.571
      - Ooh, let me think.
  Can you hang on for a second?

01:45.672 --> 01:47.840

           be amazing!

      your first date ever.

02:38.558 --> 02:39.858
      How exciting is this?

02:39.959 --> 02:42.895
   - So exciting I can't stop
        doing this dance.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.030
     - Oh. Okay. Happy now.

02:45.131 --> 02:46.298
       Get it all out now.

02:46.399 --> 02:49.034
   You don't wanna dorky dance
       on your first date.

02:49.135 --> 02:50.702
 Or it could be your last date.

02:50.803 --> 02:53.472
        - I know. Sorry.
       I'm just so happy.

02:53.573 --> 02:54.706
          For so long,
      something has always

02:54.807 --> 02:56.408
      gotten in the way of
          Kyle and me.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.776
      Well, not this time.

02:57.877 --> 02:59.344
     - You should be happy.

02:59.445 --> 03:01.480
      A first date is such
          a huge deal.

03:01.581 --> 03:03.849
        And you know what
     a first date leads to?

03:03.950 --> 03:05.184
        - A second date?

03:05.285 --> 03:06.718
  - Oh, well, yeah, that, too.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.353
        But you know what
         I was thinking?

03:08.454 --> 03:10.222
       He's gonna ask you
      to be his girlfriend!

03:10.323 --> 03:13.458
      - Woo, the "g" word!

03:13.560 --> 03:14.993
     - I've been trying not
       to think about it.

03:15.094 --> 03:17.729
   But now that you brought it
      up, I'm freaking out.

03:17.830 --> 03:18.997
         How do I look?

03:19.098 --> 03:20.732
        - You look great.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.401
      But go with the flats
           I brought.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.269
      - I like the booties.
     - They make you taller.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.104
           It might be
      intimidating to Kyle.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.340
 - Mm, but guys like a girl who
    can look 'em in the eye.

03:28.441 --> 03:29.741
        - I can see that.

03:29.842 --> 03:30.943
        She should stick
        with the booties.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.378
       - No, you're right.
   She should wear the flats.

03:33.479 --> 03:35.647
         - Or open-toe?
  - Nervous feet tend to sweat.

03:35.748 --> 03:38.483
         - Guys, you're
        making me sweat!

03:38.585 --> 03:41.253
      - Bells, don't worry.
  This night's gonna go great.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.255
   - Thank you. I'll give you
       all the highlights

03:43.356 --> 03:44.790
    after your cheer retreat.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.658
       - Oh, that's right.
     Pepper, we have to go.

03:46.759 --> 03:48.594
 The bus leaves in half an hour.

03:48.695 --> 03:50.762
    - Uh, have fun and don't
          overthink it.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.664
        You look perfect.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.733
  But maybe take off that belt.
  - And maybe put your hair up.

03:54.834 --> 03:58.070
- Maybe we should stay and help.
           - Get out!

03:58.171 --> 03:59.938
            Love you!

04:00.039 --> 04:04.676
               - ♪

04:04.777 --> 04:06.878
 - The Cheer Leadership Retreat.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.414
     Ugh, who comes up with
   the name for these things?

04:09.515 --> 04:11.183
            - I did.
    - If you'd let me finish.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.086
   Who comes up with the name
        for these things

04:14.187 --> 04:16.321
      'cause I wanna shake
           their hand.

04:16.422 --> 04:19.324
         Good job there.

04:19.425 --> 04:22.594
    - No way. Misty McIntosh
       is a guest speaker?

04:22.695 --> 04:25.764
  I've idolized her for years.
           - Me, too!

04:25.865 --> 04:28.533
She's the only reason I got into
  cheering in the first place.

04:28.635 --> 04:30.802
       - I heard her pouf
     never goes flat--ever.

04:30.903 --> 04:33.038
Not even in the rain.

04:33.139 --> 04:34.873
   - Well, I heard that she's
     so technically skilled

04:34.974 --> 04:37.676
      that she once tossed
       herself in the air,

04:37.777 --> 04:41.313
   did a full flip and caught
    herself on the way down.

04:41.414 --> 04:44.016
        I admit that was
      a little suspicious.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.251
  - There she is, Pepper, look!
        - Misty McIntosh!

04:46.352 --> 04:47.819
    - Rock, paper, scissors.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.721
        The one that gets
        to sit with her.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.823
- Okay.
- Rock, paper--

04:51.924 --> 04:53.725
       - Scissors. Shoot.

04:57.997 --> 05:00.032
       - I'm sorry, Bella.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.566
     I didn't know we'd need
reservations at the sushi place.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.335
     I feel bad that you got
         all dressed up.

05:03.436 --> 05:05.337
      - These boots aren't
       too tall, are they?

05:05.438 --> 05:06.838
      So you think I should
        have worn flats?

05:06.939 --> 05:08.140
          - Yeah, sure!

05:08.241 --> 05:10.275
      Wait, what are flats?

05:10.376 --> 05:12.511
      - Shoes. Flat shoes.

05:12.612 --> 05:16.281
        - Oh, right. No.
        No, I like shoes.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.582
           Your shoes.

05:17.684 --> 05:20.519
           I'm sorry,
       I'm really nervous.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.321
       My dad's in between
         jobs right now,

05:22.422 --> 05:25.524
 so he had way too much time to
 bug me with first date advice--

05:25.625 --> 05:28.694
get the door, tell her she looks
      pretty, wear a vest.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.595
  - You're not wearing a vest.

05:30.697 --> 05:33.365
 - Like I said--really nervous.

05:33.466 --> 05:34.666
- Don't worry.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.101
      - My friends made me
          nervous, too.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.337
     If I took their advice,
    I'd be wearing two belts.

05:38.438 --> 05:39.738
           - You are.
            - Oh, no!

05:39.839 --> 05:42.708
- I'm just kidding.

05:42.809 --> 05:50.282
       - Ah...so, uh, what
         do we do first?

05:50.383 --> 05:52.584
       - We could do this
          for a while.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.853
      - Why didn't we go on
    a date when we first met?

05:54.954 --> 06:00.225
  - Because we were six and you
 thought you were Batman, so...

06:00.326 --> 06:02.361
          - I'm sorry.
      We didn't order this.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.696
       - Actually, I did.
           Thank you.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.531
      I've known you since
     the first grade, Bella.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.266
         You always eat
       your dessert first.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.235
      - I do! I do do that!

06:10.336 --> 06:13.338
      But we just got here.
   How'd you make this happen?

06:13.439 --> 06:16.742
        - I have my ways.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.143
        - Um, I've gonna
      save this little hat

06:18.244 --> 06:19.811
     so that when we're old,

06:19.912 --> 06:22.314
      I can always remember
    our first date together.

06:22.415 --> 06:25.450
  Not that I'm already thinking
 we're gonna grow old together.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.619
         That was weird.
      Sorry, still nervous.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.655
       Oh, look, cake. Oh!

06:32.859 --> 06:35.394
       - It's a real honor
       to sit next to you.

06:35.495 --> 06:36.862
  I've idolized you for years.

06:36.963 --> 06:39.631
  I named my gerbil after you--
      Mini-Misty McIntosh.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.299
        I named my second
       one after you, too.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.968
  And my third, and my fourth.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.269
      We also have a cat--

06:44.370 --> 06:46.571
       a very hungry cat.

06:46.672 --> 06:49.007
        - Well, it's nice
         to meet a fan.

06:49.108 --> 06:50.108
           - Oh, I am!

06:50.209 --> 06:51.810
     I have to know--in that
      movie "Cheer It On,"

06:51.911 --> 06:53.845
    did they really base that
    character Melissa on you?

06:53.946 --> 06:55.514
       - Yeah. They wanted
        me for the part,

06:55.615 --> 06:58.517
  but it was during Nationals,
      so I couldn't do it.

06:58.618 --> 07:01.119
        - I'm so lucky to
        sit next to you.

07:01.220 --> 07:04.389
      - I am so lucky that
       you sat next to me.

07:04.490 --> 07:07.092
       Don't let that yarn
       fall on the floor.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.528
         - Yeah. I know.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.730
   I heard you the first time.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.635
           - You know,
     it was nice of your dad

07:16.736 --> 07:18.570
     to let us use his clubs
      tomorrow night, dude.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.605
   - Well, he normally doesn't
     let anyone touch them.

07:20.706 --> 07:23.475
        They're his most
       prized possessions.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.386
     - Here's Coach comin'.

07:34.487 --> 07:37.456
 - Troy, what's under your arm?

07:37.557 --> 07:42.494
       - It's my...Bulldog
         armpit warmer.

07:42.595 --> 07:44.529
              Warm!

07:44.630 --> 07:49.034
   - Uh-huh. I'll be watchin'
      you and your armpit.

07:49.135 --> 07:54.606
   That didn't come out right,
  but you know what I'm saying.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.641
         - Oh, my gosh,
        I was so excited,

07:56.742 --> 07:57.843
    I tried to call my girls
          three times.

07:57.944 --> 07:59.144
     Then I realized they're
    out of cell phone range,

07:59.245 --> 08:01.580
      but I've got to tell
   someone so I'm telling you.

08:01.681 --> 08:04.316
    I had the best date ever
      with Kyle last night.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.285
  - Do you think he's gonna ask
    you to be his girlfriend?

08:07.386 --> 08:08.487
          - I hope so.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.288
      - It's all happening.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.593
     - Nothing? My girls are
     out of town right now.

08:14.694 --> 08:17.095
   Can't you give me anything?

08:17.196 --> 08:20.866
       - Yay-hay-hay. Hee.

08:20.967 --> 08:24.035
    - That's good news...bro.

08:27.974 --> 08:29.708
  - Hey, there's your guy now.

08:29.809 --> 08:33.111
   - Bella, can I talk to you
    for a minute--in private?

08:33.212 --> 08:34.980
             - Sure.

08:41.153 --> 08:43.455
   - I had a really great time
     on the date last night.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.390
           - Me, too.

08:45.491 --> 08:48.360
       - Unfortuantely...
        - Unfortunately?

08:48.461 --> 08:52.631
 - My dad found out this morning
 that he finally got a new job.

08:52.732 --> 08:55.500
       But it's in Dallas.

08:55.601 --> 08:58.003
   I know it's sudden, but...

08:58.104 --> 09:01.540
         we have to move
         in a few days.

09:01.641 --> 09:05.277
     Please, say something.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.712
           - I just...

09:07.813 --> 09:10.415
    I don't know what to say.

09:10.516 --> 09:14.185
           - Bella...

09:14.287 --> 09:16.721
  - So I guess she's off to get
   ready for the second date.

09:16.822 --> 09:19.691
   It really is all happening.

09:19.792 --> 09:22.994
        - Good job, bro.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.504
 - Okay, look, on Friday night,
      we meet up here and--

09:32.605 --> 09:34.306
What's that?

09:34.407 --> 09:37.909
 It sounds like someone crying.
        - You know what?

09:38.010 --> 09:39.945
 I bet Coach checked in on that
     feisty lunch lady again

09:40.046 --> 09:41.780
       and got shut down.

09:41.881 --> 09:44.149
  - I don't think those tender
      sniffles are Coach--

09:44.250 --> 09:45.884
           this time.

09:45.985 --> 09:49.854
       Hey, Bella, are you
         okay in there?

09:49.956 --> 09:55.894
          - Hey, guys.
          - Girl tears!

09:55.995 --> 09:59.331
       - What's up, girl?
           Allergies?

09:59.432 --> 10:00.565
        Choppin' onions?

10:00.666 --> 10:02.968
    Yeah, you're good, right?

10:03.069 --> 10:05.170
         - Did something
        happen with Kyle?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.606
       - There is no Kyle.
          Not any more.

10:07.707 --> 10:11.409
  His family's moving to Dallas
     for his dad's new job.

10:14.714 --> 10:19.718
      - Um...guys, a word.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.319
    We have to do something.

10:21.420 --> 10:24.456
 - Look, I am not qualified for
   this level of girl sadness.

10:24.557 --> 10:27.926
     The Troy breaks hearts.
  You know he doesn't fix them.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.361
     - Whenever my chickens
      start feelin' moody,

10:29.462 --> 10:32.297
I just ruffle their feathers and
  tell them it's gonna be okay.

10:32.398 --> 10:36.835
    If it works on a chicken,
      it'll work on a girl.

10:36.936 --> 10:40.305
             Bella?

10:40.406 --> 10:41.673
         It'll be okay.

10:41.774 --> 10:45.510
        - How is it going
           to be okay?

10:45.611 --> 10:48.380
    - Is it too late to run?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.215
        - Look, the girls
      will know what to do.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.083
     Newt, you have Sophie's
         number, right?

10:52.184 --> 10:54.019
         - I do, but she
        blocked my phone.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.756
         I just love how
     she plays hard to get.

10:57.857 --> 11:00.158
    I'll call Pepper instead.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.694
       - It won't matter.
      You can't reach them.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.095
      Just forget it, guys.

11:04.196 --> 11:06.531
         There's nothing
        you boys can do.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.035
Hello?
       Is Bella in there?

11:10.136 --> 11:13.038
  - That's Kyle. I--I can't do
   this right now. I'm a mess.

11:13.139 --> 11:15.240
   Guys, if you really want to
  help, tell him I'm not here.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.179
        - Hey, guys, have
         you seen Bella?

11:21.280 --> 11:22.747
        I really need to
          talk to her.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.983
        - She's not here.
       - She's indisposed.

11:25.084 --> 11:27.819
        In the bathroom.
       She'll be a while.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.255
        She's...you know?

11:30.356 --> 11:32.924
        - He doesn't know
    what he's talking about.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.460
- She's not there.

11:35.561 --> 11:38.196
     - I get it. She doesn't
     wanna see me right now.

11:38.297 --> 11:40.732
   When you see her, tell her
      that I said goodbye.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.468
      And I didn't want it
        to end like this.

11:48.407 --> 11:50.608
     - Thanks, guys, but can
     I have some time alone?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.143
        I need to think.

11:52.244 --> 11:54.245
             - Yeah.
          - Of course.

11:54.346 --> 11:55.747
             - Whew!

11:55.848 --> 11:58.550
        I thought she was
      gonna ask us to stay.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.253
          - Hey, Bella,

12:02.354 --> 12:04.222
  sorry we don't have football
       practice this week.

12:04.323 --> 12:06.958
       It would have been
   a good distraction for you.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.367
We're so
     far out in the boonies,

12:16.469 --> 12:18.470
       I can't reach Bella
    to see how her date went.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.872
       - Or tell her about
          me and Misty.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.540
   It's all happening so fast.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.642
  First, we're sitting next to
      each other on the bus

12:24.744 --> 12:26.845
  and now we're having a girls'
     night when we get back.

12:26.946 --> 12:28.213
       Well, it's still in
       the planning stage.

12:28.314 --> 12:31.082
   She doesn't know about it.
     But it's gonna happen.

12:31.183 --> 12:33.885
     - Mrs. Bert invited me
     to a girls' night, too.

12:33.986 --> 12:36.755
       She's gonna knit us
          fluffy robes.

12:36.856 --> 12:39.657
        This trip bites.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.093
    - Misty! Hey, bus buddy!

12:42.194 --> 12:44.062
   - Hey, you. You know what?

12:44.163 --> 12:46.998
      I was thinking today
      I'd sit next to her.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.367
              - Me?
          - Yeah, sure.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.669
   - Awesome. I mean, I guess
    I can hang out with you.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.073
   I'll get us seats up front.
    You can have the window.

12:55.174 --> 12:57.509
 - But did I do something wrong?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.010
     - Oh, no, you're great.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.246
      I just always switch
       up who I sit with.

13:01.347 --> 13:05.049
         It keeps things
     interesting, you know?

13:05.151 --> 13:07.085
           - Oh, okay.

13:07.186 --> 13:09.854
    - Get in here, bus buddy!
 I saved us a seat on the hump.

13:09.955 --> 13:16.928
               - ♪

13:17.029 --> 13:18.530
   - ♪ It's bye week Friday ♪

13:18.631 --> 13:20.431
♪ We're finally goin'-- ♪

13:20.533 --> 13:23.234
           - Up! Down!
      - What are you doin'?

13:23.335 --> 13:25.503
 - Oh, hey, guys. Since there's
     no practice this week,

13:25.604 --> 13:27.438
      just thought I'd work
        in a few drills.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.841
Up! Down!

13:29.942 --> 13:32.143
       - Uh, okay, well...

13:32.244 --> 13:33.945
         at least you're
       not cryin' anymore.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.446
      - Yep, no more tears.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.415
  I'm not gonna cry about him,
   not gonna think about him,

13:37.516 --> 13:39.551
        not gonna doodle
    "Mrs. Kyle Dawson-Webber"

13:39.652 --> 13:41.719
     in my journal anymore.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.321
        - Why the sudden
        change of heart?

13:43.422 --> 13:44.889
       - Life's too short
      to cry over something

13:44.990 --> 13:46.591
         that was never
        going to happen.

13:46.692 --> 13:49.427
     So, I took your advice
   and I found a distraction.

13:49.528 --> 13:51.930
        I've been working
         out like crazy.

13:52.031 --> 13:54.866
 Ooh, and now I'm gonna go over
  my playbook for a few hours,

13:54.967 --> 13:57.569
      then I'm gonna clean
        my locker--again.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.305
         Woo-hoo! Yeah!

14:00.406 --> 14:02.540
  - Okay, I have watched enough
    "Oprah" with my gram-gram

14:02.641 --> 14:05.243
        to know that girl
      is totally in denial.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.811
     - She seems fine to me.

14:06.912 --> 14:08.847
 She's just cleanin' her locker
   and organizing her shampoo.

14:08.948 --> 14:12.150
 - Tangerine Mist, what are you
    doing next to Coco Loco?

14:12.251 --> 14:14.986
  You're citrus--deal with it!

14:15.087 --> 14:17.222
      - Yeah, Newt's right.

14:17.323 --> 14:19.958
 Coco ain't the only thing loco,
    you know what I'm sayin'?

14:20.059 --> 14:22.260
      Girl needs some help.
       - Girlfriend help.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.863
   And while Sophie and Pepper
      are gone, guess what?

14:24.964 --> 14:26.931
      We're her replacement
          girlfriends.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.566
      - We're not equipped
       to be girlfriends.

14:28.667 --> 14:32.437
    - We're not girlfriends,
       but Bella needs us.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.572
    We've gotta do something
    to help her feel better.

14:34.673 --> 14:37.041
      - I know what always
      makes me feel better.

14:37.142 --> 14:39.077
       - No, man, we can't
        take her with us.

14:39.178 --> 14:40.745
           That's our
     super-secret tradition.

14:40.846 --> 14:43.882
       - Yeah, but, dude,
  she's our QB and our friend.

14:43.983 --> 14:45.383
        Plus, if we don't
          fix this now,

14:45.484 --> 14:48.887
     she might start talkin'
        to her deodorant.

14:48.988 --> 14:50.421
  - Fine, she can come with us.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.724
     But, Newt, you'd better
    not call me "girlfriend."

14:52.825 --> 14:56.628
 - That's a term of endearment.
    - Yes, among girlfriends.

15:00.366 --> 15:02.333
    - I don't think Mrs. Bert
     even knows how to knit.

15:02.434 --> 15:05.737
      I mean, that sweater
     has way too many arms.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.172
       Or maybe she's just
     married to an octopus.

15:08.274 --> 15:09.707
You're funny.

15:09.808 --> 15:12.477
  It's nice to be sitting next
   to you, instead of Pepper.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.846
      She talked my ear off
        the whole way up.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.080
- Oh...

15:16.181 --> 15:17.582
       If you really wanna
        get Pepper going,

15:17.683 --> 15:20.952
    talk to her about Paris.
  She loves everything French.

15:21.053 --> 15:24.756
   I mean, she's always like,
"It's croissant, not crawzzant."

15:24.857 --> 15:26.758
       - Well, thankfully,
    I'm not gonna talk to her

15:26.859 --> 15:29.060
   about anything ever again.

15:29.161 --> 15:30.795
         - Oh, come on.
       She's really sweet.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.964
  She was probably just really
      excited to meet you.

15:33.065 --> 15:34.532
      - Of course, she was.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.668
    Every little dorky cheer
        wanna-be like her

15:36.769 --> 15:38.036
     is excited to meet me.

15:38.137 --> 15:42.073
 But that girl might be the most
   annoying one I've ever met.

15:42.174 --> 15:43.841
        - Whoa, don't you
       think you might be

15:43.943 --> 15:45.376
   exaggerating just a little?

15:45.477 --> 15:47.612
         I mean, she's--
          - No, no, no!

15:47.713 --> 15:49.314
        She is the worst.

15:49.415 --> 15:50.682
         I would rather
         eat my pompoms

15:50.783 --> 15:54.452
       than listen to her
      for one more second.

15:54.553 --> 15:55.553
             - Wow.

15:55.654 --> 15:57.956
    You know, yesterday I was
       super jealous that

15:58.057 --> 15:59.624
 Pepper got to sit next to you.

15:59.725 --> 16:03.127
    But now, I can't believe
    I ever looked up to you.

16:03.228 --> 16:05.997
         You're a jerk.
          - Excuse me?

16:06.098 --> 16:07.432
    - Yeah, you heard right.

16:07.533 --> 16:11.436
  Oh, and by the way, everyone
   knows you stuff your pouf.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.842
       Pass me some yarn.
        - What happened?

16:17.943 --> 16:20.445
     Did Misty send you away
   to keep things interesting?

16:20.546 --> 16:23.314
    - No, I just thought I'd
      rather sit back here.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.183
          - Did she say
       anything about me?

16:25.284 --> 16:28.019
      - Yeah, um, she said
       you're super cool.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.755
      - Oh, thank goodness.
        I was so worried.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.857
   Does Misty want me to come
     back and sit with her?

16:32.958 --> 16:36.027
         - Um, well, I--
- 'Cause it's kind of exhausting

16:36.128 --> 16:38.229
      sitting next to Misty
         and, honestly,

16:38.330 --> 16:40.198
   I'd rather sit next to you.

16:40.299 --> 16:43.434
     - You should stay here.
         I'd like that.

16:43.535 --> 16:46.170
      - Did, uh, Misty say
       anything about me?

16:46.271 --> 16:49.073
            - No. No.

16:49.174 --> 16:53.811
               - ♪

16:53.912 --> 16:58.950
  - I present to you the answer
     to all your problems--

16:59.051 --> 17:01.152
            Melfing.
       - We call it that--

17:01.253 --> 17:04.355
    - Because you're golfing
          with melons.

17:04.455 --> 17:07.425
       - It was a mistake
          to bring her.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.460
  - Guys, I don't even know why
  I'm here in the first place.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.895
I'm fine.

17:10.996 --> 17:13.765
     - An hour ago, you were
     scolding your shampoo.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.633
        You're not fine.

17:15.733 --> 17:16.901
  - Look, I know it looks dumb,

17:17.002 --> 17:19.069
    but hitting these rotten
    melons as hard as we can

17:19.171 --> 17:21.305
 has helped us through more bad
   times than we can remember.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.307
    - Guys, I appreciate it,
      but I really don't--

17:23.409 --> 17:25.343
     - Watch, non-believer.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.681
   I hate that I have to share
     a room with my sister,

17:30.783 --> 17:33.384
        but all the pigs
       get their own pens!

17:37.589 --> 17:39.924
  - Why doesn't Sophie like me?

17:40.025 --> 17:43.428
         Wait. Does she?

17:43.529 --> 17:45.797
   Why doesn't Sophie like me?

17:50.536 --> 17:53.671
     - I can't believe I got
     replaced by a girl QB!

18:00.913 --> 18:04.816
       Sorry. You weren't
      supposed to be here.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.952
      - Now you try, Bella.
   It'll help you feel better.

18:10.055 --> 18:13.124
       Okay, can I go now?

18:13.225 --> 18:14.826
      - Bella, can you just
          listen to us?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.294
       We're trying to be
       your girlfriends--

18:16.395 --> 18:18.529
       I mean, we're just
       trying to help you.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.498
        - How is hitting
    a bunch of rotten melons

18:20.599 --> 18:22.333
      supposed to help me?

18:22.434 --> 18:24.335
        This is so dumb.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.903
        And frustrating.

18:26.004 --> 18:27.171
       Just like my life.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.173
    I waited so long for Kyle
        and me to happen

18:29.274 --> 18:31.008
 and now, like that, it's over?

18:33.445 --> 18:35.313
     - All I've ever wanted
    is for us to be together.

18:35.414 --> 18:36.914
      And something always
        got in the way--

18:37.015 --> 18:40.017
        Charlotte Newman,
   fake dating and now Dallas?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.019
         It isn't fair!

18:42.121 --> 18:43.721
         - Bella, you--

18:43.822 --> 18:45.756
 - Sawyer, if you say something
       else about chicken,

18:45.858 --> 18:47.959
 I will start crying and I won't
    stop until the playoffs.

18:48.060 --> 18:51.129
    - I was gonna ask what's
       in the way tonight?

18:51.230 --> 18:52.864
             - What?

18:52.965 --> 18:55.833
 - You and Kyle. What's keeping
      you apart right now?

18:55.934 --> 18:57.869
        - Well...nothing.

18:57.970 --> 19:02.807
    - Right and he's leaving,
     but he's not gone yet.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.609
         - You're right.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.545
  I gotta go, but thanks, guys.
      Melfing was awesome.

19:07.646 --> 19:13.184
    You're great girlfriends.
     Especially you, Sawyer.

19:13.285 --> 19:15.920
       - Dude, you hit it
       right in the field.

19:16.021 --> 19:18.022
   - Sawyer, that was the most
     emotionally-aware thing

19:18.123 --> 19:19.924
    I've ever heard you say.

19:20.025 --> 19:23.327
- Honestly, I was just gonna say
 something else about chickens.

19:23.428 --> 19:24.962
        Don't know where
   the rest of that came from.

19:25.063 --> 19:27.265
        Total freestyle.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.734
- Aha!

19:29.835 --> 19:31.836
         I knew you guys
      were up to something.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.605
     - Coach, we were just--
       - Oh, relax, Dixon.

19:34.706 --> 19:36.240
      This looks like fun.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.709
       Hand me that club.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.074

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Run!

19:50.088 --> 19:53.057
            Run! Run!

19:53.158 --> 19:55.459
     - My dad's golf clubs!

19:58.263 --> 20:00.531
Nah!

20:09.474 --> 20:12.476
            - Bella?

20:12.578 --> 20:13.978
    What are you doing here?

20:14.079 --> 20:16.414
   - I wanted to say I'm sorry
     for hiding out from you

20:16.515 --> 20:18.416
        earlier when you
      came to say goodbye.

20:18.517 --> 20:21.018
      It was totally uncool
     to avoid you like that.

20:21.119 --> 20:22.587
            - I know.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.789
           No, I mean,
        I totally get it.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.994
     Can I be totally honest
    with you about something?

20:30.095 --> 20:31.662
     I was kinda bummed that

20:31.763 --> 20:33.531
      you weren't going to
     be my first boyfriend.

20:33.632 --> 20:36.601
       - Me, too. I would
     have really liked that.

20:36.702 --> 20:41.539
     - Well, what's keeping
       us apart right now?

20:41.640 --> 20:44.508
         - Bella Dawson,
   will you be my girlfriend?

20:44.610 --> 20:46.911
          - Absolutely.

20:50.082 --> 20:55.386
So...
       What do we do now?

20:55.487 --> 20:57.822
       - We could do this
          for a while.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.635
        - Hey, we're back
      in cell phone range.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.637
         And I have like
       a hundred messages.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.238
           - Me, too.

21:14.339 --> 21:16.707
Hey, girls, what's up?
     Typical Wednesday here.

21:16.808 --> 21:19.143
       Just got back from
   an awesome date with Kyle.

21:19.244 --> 21:20.344
           So excited!

21:20.445 --> 21:21.479
- Nice.

21:21.580 --> 21:24.615
Kyle's leaving!
  My whole world's collapsing!

21:24.716 --> 21:26.384
      My heart's breaking!

21:26.485 --> 21:29.420
- Typical Thursday.
Uh-oh.

21:29.521 --> 21:31.389
Hey, girls, just
     did a hundred sit-ups.

21:31.490 --> 21:34.592
 Might pump out a hundred more.
    You know, typical Friday.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.961
      - This can't be good.

21:37.062 --> 21:39.597
Hey, girls, forget
       my other messages.

21:39.698 --> 21:41.365
       I have a boyfriend!

21:42.467 --> 21:44.669
     but I'm gonna make them
     the best two days ever.

21:44.770 --> 21:48.639
     - Wow, we missed a lot.
          - I guess so.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.107
  Oh, I still have one message.

21:50.208 --> 21:53.044
    - Hey, Pepper, what's up?
           It's Newt.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.579
       Um, so this message
       is for Sophie and--

21:55.681 --> 21:57.081
      - That's enough voice
        mails for today.
