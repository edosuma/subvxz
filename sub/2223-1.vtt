01:50.955 --> 01:54.715
- How'd I do?
- 4:32. Incredible!

01:54.995 --> 01:56.715
One last record
before I leave!

01:56.795 --> 02:00.955
Keep the stopwatch
I don't need it anymore.

02:01.035 --> 02:05.955
Speech! Speech!

02:12.835 --> 02:13.955
Where is my little Daniel?

02:25.995 --> 02:29.995
Like you all know
Daniel resigned last night

02:30.995 --> 02:33.995
He's leaving the 2 wheelers
for the 4 wheelers

02:35.035 --> 02:39.755
Thus reversing the path of human evolution
that started on all fours,...

02:39.835 --> 02:41.755
...and finishes on 2 wheels!

02:41.875 --> 02:44.995
I want him to know
he was the best of all of us,...

02:45.075 --> 02:47.995
...and most of all,
a very good friend.

02:49.035 --> 02:50.515
You're going be missed by all of us you know.

03:06.035 --> 03:09.035
Excuse me Lily, was that a kiss?
or did your lips just slip?

03:10.035 --> 03:13.035
It's not that I didn't like it
but I don't know what to think...

03:18.875 --> 03:19.875
Is it clearer now?

03:22.915 --> 03:23.875
Yep.

03:25.075 --> 03:28.035
They slipped again,
You must be really clumsy.

03:31.075 --> 03:33.035
And now to celebrate
Daniel's departure,...

03:34.075 --> 03:35.875
...I announce the big parade!

03:37.075 --> 03:40.035
Open your eyes wide, Lily,
because you won't see again in your lifetime.

03:40.915 --> 03:42.875
- How many are there?
- A lot.

03:57.115 --> 03:58.075
Here are the best.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.075
Go for it!

04:14.955 --> 04:15.915
Holy shit!

04:37.155 --> 04:38.115
Excellent!

04:49.195 --> 04:51.115
- A little party?
- Are they from the pizzeria?

04:52.195 --> 04:56.115
- Bacon pizzas. -Excuse us but
we would like to see your papers.

04:56.275 --> 05:00.115
I'm sorry we left them inside
if you want we can go and get them now.

05:00.275 --> 05:04.115
- Ok but make it fast. -No problem,
Thanks. lets run!

05:16.195 --> 05:18.195
It must have been 5 minutes now.

05:36.235 --> 05:39.195
- Be careful - there could be some oil.
- Oil?

05:40.235 --> 05:43.195
Yeah, it's my flat
but it's also kind of a Garage.

05:46.235 --> 05:48.195
I hope that...

05:51.235 --> 05:52.195
Hmm, its... special.

05:53.235 --> 05:54.955
- Daniel.
- Yes?

05:55.075 --> 05:57.035
It's been 2 years
since we met each other.

05:58.075 --> 06:00.195
Why did you wait until the day you leave
to show me your flat?

06:00.315 --> 06:04.235
- I'm really bad at decision making.
- And what made you decide?

06:07.275 --> 06:08.235
Your cleavage.

06:09.275 --> 06:10.235
It's nice, heh?

06:11.275 --> 06:12.235
The dress is brand new.

06:13.275 --> 06:15.235
Ok then
we will try not to damage it.

06:17.275 --> 06:20.235
Are you sure it's okay
after years just as friends?

06:20.355 --> 06:22.235
We prepared the terrain well,
it's time to build on it.

06:23.275 --> 06:25.235
- Maybe we could wait a little bit longer.
- No, if we wait longer,..

06:25.355 --> 06:29.035
...you'll just get frustrated
and I don't want to be impolite.

06:34.955 --> 06:36.235
- Oh, no.
- What?

06:37.275 --> 06:39.275
- It's 6 o'clock.
- But it's Saturday.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.275
- Yes, but I must go to work.
- What?

06:42.315 --> 06:44.995
You just stopped working last night,
you didn't find a job during the night?

06:45.115 --> 06:47.235
No, it's for my future job...

06:47.355 --> 06:49.275
...an appointment I booked
a long time ago.

06:50.315 --> 06:53.075
But you waited for our "appointment"
for a long time.

06:54.315 --> 06:57.275
Yes, a long time plus an hour.
And when I say 1 hour, that's a maximum.

07:10.315 --> 07:12.275
Hey, blue boy, you take a number over there.

07:23.995 --> 07:27.275
Don't forget your photos next time.
77!

07:27.395 --> 07:30.315
247. It's not even near my number.

07:36.195 --> 07:38.275
- How long have you been a driver?
- 25 years yesterday.

07:39.355 --> 07:41.315
I'm retired since this morning.

07:41.435 --> 07:45.315
It's the first morning I can relax
and read the newspaper in 25 years.

07:47.195 --> 07:48.155
Ah I see.

07:56.355 --> 07:58.355
Wake up number 247!

08:00.355 --> 08:01.355
I am here!

08:01.435 --> 08:06.355
Your form, 2 pictures...
sign here... and here.

08:08.395 --> 08:11.355
Profesional Licence,
circulation certificate,...

08:13.395 --> 08:19.315
...acquisition authorisation,
the notebook, the plate and the sign.

08:24.395 --> 08:26.355
- That's all?
- Yes.

08:29.395 --> 08:31.355
- Nothing more after 6 years?
- You want me to sing "La Marseillaise"?

08:32.395 --> 08:34.355
No, but a smile would have been nice.

08:38.395 --> 08:39.395
248!

08:41.395 --> 08:42.235
Lily!

08:46.435 --> 08:48.395
It's 12:00, I went
to buy croissants...

08:48.475 --> 08:50.395
...and, meanwhile, I married
the baker.

08:51.435 --> 08:53.395
Goodbye and farewell.

09:08.435 --> 09:12.395
Congratulations, Mr. Daniel.
You're welcome.

09:12.515 --> 09:14.395
Yes, we insist.
Ok then...

09:55.475 --> 09:56.475
- Hi, Daniel!
- Hey, Paulo!

09:57.475 --> 09:58.475
- You're working in tourism now?
- Yes.

09:59.475 --> 10:02.475
Your party was great
we drank like hell.

10:02.555 --> 10:05.515
- Yep, it was great.
But your bike sounds weird. Is it ok?

10:05.516 --> 10:08.475
Isn't there a strange noise?
Does it work well?

10:08.555 --> 10:10.475
Well?
I use super-unleaded.

10:10.555 --> 10:14.475
I just ran from 2 cops, you should have seen that.

10:15.515 --> 10:18.475
Ok I'll tell you, 2 police
on bikes on the Avenue.

10:19.515 --> 10:23.435
Before they were in first gear,
I had made it to the beach.

10:23.595 --> 10:27.475
They were furious.

10:27.595 --> 10:33.475
I hit full speed and left them
standing. They couldn't believe it.

10:33.595 --> 10:36.515
They won't forget
Paulo that easily.

10:36.595 --> 10:39.515
They didn't forget you Paulo.

10:43.555 --> 10:46.515
Hey girls!
still wearing the moustaches?

10:55.555 --> 10:56.515
Go, Paulo.

10:59.555 --> 11:02.515
Hey girls - going to the beach?
It's a free ride today.

11:02.635 --> 11:04.515
You will love it.
Want to come?

11:06.555 --> 11:09.515
Hey are you a "taxi",
or a nice taxi?

11:09.635 --> 11:11.515
The driver
is super nice.

11:12.555 --> 11:17.515
He opens the door, doesn't make you car-sick,
Doesn't speak unless spoken to.

11:17.635 --> 11:21.555
- and he carries your bags if asked nicely.
- Thank you, perfect.

11:29.595 --> 11:30.555
And where are we going Miss?

11:31.595 --> 11:35.515
You see the pink house over there,
with a big door?

11:36.275 --> 11:38.555
- Yes, I see it.
- That's where we are going.

11:44.595 --> 11:46.555
Do you prefer any route
in particular?

11:48.595 --> 11:50.555
Put all that in the kitchen,
I'll organise it later.

11:51.595 --> 11:56.555
- You have enough food for a week here.
- Oh no, my son is coming for lunch.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.595
- All that for one meal?
- No. On Sunday he prepares...

11:59.675 --> 12:02.595
...all his meals
for the week.

12:02.675 --> 12:04.595
His flat is so small
there is no kitchen.

12:04.675 --> 12:07.595
and he's unable to cook
even an egg.

12:07.675 --> 12:10.595
Look.
that's him in the picture.

12:11.635 --> 12:15.595
He's a computer programmer.
He works at IBM.

12:16.315 --> 12:19.595
- Everybody has their thing.
- And you. What is your "thing"?

12:19.715 --> 12:22.595
I love driving, but
you probably didn't have time to see it!

12:23.635 --> 12:27.595
My son's taking his driving
test for the 8th time.

12:27.715 --> 12:31.435
8 times!
8 is my lucky number. It will be lucky for him too.

12:34.635 --> 12:36.635
At the end of the street,
we are going to take the first...

12:37.635 --> 12:38.635
on... on ...on?

12:39.635 --> 12:41.635
On the left,
Mr. Carbadec.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.635
On the left, on the left!

12:45.715 --> 12:48.635
On the left! Are you crazy? We are going to crash!

12:51.675 --> 12:55.635
Holy shit!
In the 10 years I've worked here I've never met such a complete idiot!

12:56.675 --> 12:58.635
Can't you distinguish right from left?

13:00.675 --> 13:03.635
- Yes but you needed to tell me earlier.
- Maybe I should have sent a fax?

13:03.755 --> 13:07.635
LEFT LEFT! It's not so difficult Man!
You turn a steering wheel and press a pedal!

13:08.675 --> 13:10.635
I'm only doing my duty.
- And what is your duty?

13:11.675 --> 13:13.635
Who the hell would hire a moron like you?

13:13.755 --> 13:15.275
A circus; a zoo; BT or what?

13:16.475 --> 13:18.075
Umm, a little bit of each...

13:19.275 --> 13:19.875
"POLICE"

13:20.675 --> 13:23.675
Ah you should have said it earlier.
Should I have sent a fax?

13:24.715 --> 13:25.675
Excuse me.

13:26.715 --> 13:28.675
Can I offer you something Mr. Inspector?

13:30.555 --> 13:31.515
Thank you it's superb.

13:31.755 --> 13:35.675
Thank you. You are so nice,
I'll keep your card.

13:36.715 --> 13:40.675
I don't want to be rude but
I need to go work. Is it ok if I eat in the Taxi?

13:40.795 --> 13:42.675
Sure go ahead,
go to work!

13:50.715 --> 13:53.675
Can you save my life?
Basically, no.

13:55.715 --> 13:58.475
Ok... it depends on your symptoms.

13:58.555 --> 14:01.715
I have a flight in 25 minutes.
If I miss it I'm a dead man.

14:01.795 --> 14:03.555
If I catch it,
you are a rich man.

14:06.555 --> 14:07.555
Humm... you are lucky man...

14:08.595 --> 14:09.555
I'm no doctor but,...

14:10.755 --> 14:13.715
...I really like emergencies.
Buckle up please!

14:46.795 --> 14:48.595
Maybe we should go now.

14:53.795 --> 14:54.755
Let's party!

15:27.835 --> 15:29.075
A white taxi
doing incredible speed!

15:29.675 --> 15:30.475
Screwed my radar!

15:30.675 --> 15:32.075
We'll take care of it. Got his number?

15:32.275 --> 15:33.475
No; didn't have time. It was too fast.

15:33.675 --> 15:35.875
Keep your eyes open!
That's your job!

15:43.835 --> 15:45.555
Do you think we are going to make it
on time?

15:45.835 --> 15:48.795
If we're going to miss it maybe
we should take our time.

15:49.835 --> 15:53.795
It will be ok, we are going slowly now,
but on the motorway we can get up some speed.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.835
Ah I see, I see.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.835
Don't take risks for me
I don't want you to lose your licence.

16:19.955 --> 16:21.835
No problem,
I don't have a licence.

16:24.875 --> 16:25.835
Oh fantastic.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.875
14 minutes and 30 seconds.

16:42.955 --> 16:46.715
Leaves you time to read the paper and
maybe a have a coffee. Have a good trip sir.

16:47.915 --> 16:48.715
Thank you.

17:04.755 --> 17:05.714
I don't understand.

17:09.755 --> 17:10.875
On the computer I'm unbeatable.

17:10.994 --> 17:13.875
First in Monaco,
Eight pole positions.

17:14.915 --> 17:16.714
But on the streets
I'm a disaster.

17:17.915 --> 17:19.875
Hey. How did you do?

17:20.675 --> 17:21.474
Failed again.

17:21.954 --> 17:27.915
No! You can't...
Champagne does get better with time...

17:27.994 --> 17:29.475
...but this is almost
past it's sell-by date.

17:30.875 --> 17:31.475
What happened?

17:31.955 --> 17:34.315
Hit a butcher shop.
Makes a change from a paper stand.

17:34.675 --> 17:35.275
You know what?

17:36.955 --> 17:38.915
You should put a Mouse in your car,
instead of your steering wheel.

17:39.955 --> 17:42.915
Like the disabled.

17:43.035 --> 17:43.915
Come on...

17:51.955 --> 17:53.075
Emilien, we just got
another record.

17:54.955 --> 17:56.955
A taxi, near the harbour.
You know how fast?

17:57.675 --> 17:58.075
140?

17:58.475 --> 17:59.475
Yes - in first gear.

17:59.675 --> 18:01.755
When he engaged 2nd:
217 Km/h!

18:02.475 --> 18:03.275
You got it?

18:03.475 --> 18:05.875
Do you think they called in the Air Force?
Imagine that speed!

18:06.995 --> 18:09.955
Hey you heard the latest one?
Listen, it's funny.

18:10.035 --> 18:12.955
What is the difference between
a comb and an egg?

18:16.995 --> 18:20.155
Hey you are a lousy audience.
I'll come back later.

18:20.675 --> 18:24.475
Yes, much later, and if it's night-time,
so much the better.

18:25.275 --> 18:26.795
Next time,
knock before you enter!

18:30.835 --> 18:31.795
Petra...

18:33.835 --> 18:35.995
I didn't say that for you

18:36.075 --> 18:39.995
Ok Emilien. So what happened
with your test, it went badly?

18:40.075 --> 18:41.995
Ah, the news travels fast.

18:43.035 --> 18:46.995
I've got news for you.
The Chief is holding a meeting, and there's only you two missing

18:48.035 --> 18:49.075
Ah no... we weren't informed

18:49.475 --> 18:51.755
You just have to push that button

18:51.875 --> 18:53.995
You see there; "Power".

18:55.035 --> 18:57.995
You hear me or what? In my office right now!
Are you deaf Emilien?

18:58.115 --> 18:58.835
No, not anymore.

19:00.035 --> 19:03.755
So guys, after hitting Dutch, Italian, and Belgian banks...

19:03.875 --> 19:05.755
...the Mercedes Gang
just arrived in France

19:05.875 --> 19:08.995
These Germans absolutely must not invade our territory

19:11.035 --> 19:13.995
My grandpa fell into their hands. That makes it personal.

19:14.115 --> 19:18.035
So the Paris-Berlin links and French-German entent can kiss my arse!

19:18.115 --> 19:21.035
Alright? No I don't mean you Petra.

19:21.115 --> 19:23.035
You are German... right, but you are a cop so it's ok.

19:24.075 --> 19:27.035
And they have the gaul to nominate
a city before hitting its banks!

19:27.115 --> 19:28.035
It's unbelievable!

19:28.115 --> 19:31.035
In 3 days
it will be Marseille bank.

19:31.115 --> 19:33.035
Red Alert,
24 hours a day!

19:35.075 --> 19:37.035
We've got support
One driver per team.

19:38.075 --> 19:42.795
When the Germans exit the bank, our teams will follow them...

19:42.915 --> 19:46.035
...not losing them; twisting and
turning after them like a snake... before we strike!

19:47.075 --> 19:49.035
Guys, this is why
this operation will be called

19:50.075 --> 19:51.035
...Cobra.

19:53.075 --> 19:54.835
Petra, Can you please assemble the teams?

19:55.075 --> 20:00.075
3 per car. One driver of the GGM, one co-ordinator and one sniper.

20:00.155 --> 20:03.835
Each team has a code-name and a stake-out
marked on the map behind you.

20:03.915 --> 20:06.075
The teams members are listed next to the map.

20:06.155 --> 20:08.075
You have 50 minutes to get into position.

20:09.115 --> 20:12.075
Excuse me Petra, that dinner date we talked about...

20:13.115 --> 20:15.075
...this week would be nice,
because...

20:15.195 --> 20:18.075
...the computer software I developed, that we've talked about...

20:19.115 --> 20:23.075
...shouldn't be left too long.
Somebody could steal the idea.

20:23.195 --> 20:26.275
Oh no, ...who can't wait?
You or the software?

20:26.675 --> 20:27.075
Me

20:27.195 --> 20:29.075
No! Him..lt... the software...
the computer.

20:30.115 --> 20:33.075
It's complicated.
This is why I thought...

20:35.115 --> 20:36.115
...dinner...

20:38.115 --> 20:42.115
As soon as the Germans are arrested,
I promise, I'm going to take care of you...

20:42.195 --> 20:45.115
...of the software I mean.
Ah perfect.

20:45.195 --> 20:48.115
Which team are you in?
With the Cobra.

20:48.195 --> 20:50.115
Don't worry, you are lucky
I've put you in the best team.

21:20.155 --> 21:22.155
Damn, There's no more coffee.

21:27.195 --> 21:29.155
Hey have you seen my steering wheel?
It's nice, it's mine...

21:29.235 --> 21:31.155
...I bought it from Alain Prost.

21:33.195 --> 21:35.155
with a new grip
special Dakkar.

21:35.275 --> 21:38.155
Even with a load of sand in the car...

21:38.275 --> 21:41.155
Oh yeah?
Too bad we aren't at the beach then.

21:42.195 --> 21:44.155
Hey, don't smoke
It irritates my eyes

21:44.275 --> 21:46.075
No coffee, no smoking...

21:46.475 --> 21:47.155
No girls!!

21:51.195 --> 21:54.155
Boa calling TinySnake.
I repeat: Boa calling TinySnake.

21:54.275 --> 21:57.955
TinySnake here, I'm listening.
Yeah, it's Alan. Is your team any good?

21:58.035 --> 22:00.195
Superb. We are exchanging addresses.
And you?

22:00.275 --> 22:02.675
Somebody is about to piss on me.
Apart from that everything's fine.

22:04.235 --> 22:08.195
Rachid, the small black Peugeot behind?

22:08.275 --> 22:11.195
Man! You're crazy Marco!
We are not going to steal a car during the day!

22:11.275 --> 22:14.195
Oh yeah, why not?

22:15.235 --> 22:16.955
Fuck, Marco! Its full of cops!

22:17.075 --> 22:19.195
We don't know this neighbourhood, We should stick to what we know.

22:20.235 --> 22:24.195
No problem, all the cops are at the airport!

22:24.315 --> 22:27.195
Theres are none for 20Km
around here.

22:28.235 --> 22:29.275
Are you crazy?

22:29.675 --> 22:31.595
Be calm man! All the cops are
at the airport. I told you!

22:32.235 --> 22:35.235
I've seen it on TV. Clinton
is there with his girl

22:36.235 --> 22:39.235
Hey Cops! Look at Marco
he kisses you

22:40.235 --> 22:43.235
Lets arrest him.
No, let him take the car,...

22:43.315 --> 22:45.235
...let him finish his little act,
We need a better view.

22:47.275 --> 22:48.995
I need to take a leak.

22:49.115 --> 22:51.075
No, we can't leave the car. It's orders.

22:54.275 --> 22:56.235
You see? All at the airport like I said.

22:59.275 --> 23:01.235
Smile guys, you are on film.

23:02.795 --> 23:05.235
I tell you guys if they don't show up
in one minute with their Mercedes,...

23:05.355 --> 23:07.235
...it's going to be coffee, smokes and a piss.

23:08.275 --> 23:09.635
We're going to do all that later man!

23:16.275 --> 23:18.675
To all the snakes... don't strike
until the mouse gets out of its hole.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.675
I repeat don't strike until they exit.

23:22.115 --> 23:25.035
Commissioner?
No Petra, don't disturb me now, I'm busy.

23:25.115 --> 23:26.275
But it's the Minister.

23:28.315 --> 23:30.355
Mr Minister, aren't you at the airport?

23:30.475 --> 23:34.075
We just finished.
Tell me more about that Mercedes gang...

23:34.315 --> 23:39.275
We have located them and will grab them shortly.

23:39.395 --> 23:42.475
Good! I have told my German colleague
that we will catch them right away.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.035
The krauts won't get a chance...

23:44.155 --> 23:46.275
...to learn much about Marseilles

23:46.395 --> 23:48.275
Tonight they will be in jail.
Tomorrow I'll send them home...

23:48.395 --> 23:49.275
...Special Delivery.

23:49.675 --> 23:50.475
Hold on a minute

23:50.875 --> 23:53.795
I don't want this to become
a settling of accounts between French and Germans.

23:53.875 --> 23:56.795
The war is over Gibert.
Of course, Mr Mister

23:56.915 --> 24:02.075
I understand perfectly. They are criminals
just like the others, they aren't treated differently

24:02.155 --> 24:04.315
Maybe you should start by not calling them krauts.

24:05.475 --> 24:06.075
I called them krauts?

24:06.475 --> 24:07.275
Yes.

24:08.355 --> 24:09.075
Krauts?

24:09.155 --> 24:09.675
Yes.

24:10.475 --> 24:12.475
My mistake Mr Minister.

24:12.595 --> 24:13.795
I can count on you?

24:14.075 --> 24:15.315
Yes, don't worry. Remember the Chinks

24:17.355 --> 24:20.315
Er, I mean the Asians.
Everything went smoothly.

24:20.435 --> 24:22.075
Almost no deaths.

24:22.675 --> 24:23.675
At least, not on our side.

24:26.355 --> 24:30.155
Hello? Hello?
He hung up!

24:44.195 --> 24:45.195
You see, it's easy.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.475
Where are the cables?
Shit, Marco! Hurry up!

24:52.875 --> 24:55.075
Move the car stupid
or do you want me to bring you the keys?

24:59.675 --> 25:03.755
We are the "Coolbras"
and in Coolbra there is the word "cool"

25:04.395 --> 25:07.275
We going to be "cool" rather than poisonous ok?

25:13.235 --> 25:16.155
To all the snakes, don't miss them,
we want them alive.

25:16.235 --> 25:17.195
At least for an hour.

25:23.435 --> 25:26.195
I'm not really in the mood for this.
I guess I'd better leave you guys.

25:27.435 --> 25:29.395
And...
I really have to take a leak.

25:37.475 --> 25:38.875
Lets GO!!

25:42.475 --> 25:45.235
What is going on?
Something's wrong Mr Minister.

25:48.475 --> 25:49.395
Don't move Mr Minister.

25:58.475 --> 25:59.235
Shit!

26:00.475 --> 26:02.475
We've been ambushed!
Send us backup.

26:06.475 --> 26:07.475
I identified the car...

26:10.515 --> 26:13.475
I repeat, I identified the accomplice's car.

26:13.555 --> 26:16.435
Four well-trained men.
Backup is coming Mr Minister!

26:28.515 --> 26:29.475
Shit, shit!

26:55.555 --> 26:57.515
Sir. I think we are shooting at cops.

27:00.555 --> 27:01.515
Are they surrendering?

27:03.555 --> 27:10.315
Hello, TinySnake here.
We had a small problem with the car door.

27:11.555 --> 27:13.515
Good morning sir. Don't worry
you can go in 5 minutes.

27:15.555 --> 27:16.875
No problem, no problem.

27:17.075 --> 27:17.875
Thank you sir.

27:20.395 --> 27:21.355
Here, there are giving up.

27:24.555 --> 27:27.555
Uh it's funny... he looks just like...

27:27.635 --> 27:29.555
Like the Minister.

27:34.595 --> 27:36.355
You didn't eat anything.

27:36.475 --> 27:38.515
I'm not really hungry today.

27:38.795 --> 27:40.075
Mum, no

27:40.875 --> 27:42.475
Don't worry about your licence.

27:43.595 --> 27:46.075
Remember your father, he never got one.

27:46.875 --> 27:49.395
What? How come?
I remember him driving.when I was young

27:49.475 --> 27:50.475
Yes, it's true.

27:50.595 --> 27:53.555
He took the test 20 times
At the end they just gave it to him!

27:54.595 --> 27:57.555
Thanks, I feel better now.
You're welcome

27:57.675 --> 28:00.555
Here, David, the landlord's son,
asked me if you could repair that.

28:01.595 --> 28:03.315
Yeah, tell him my name isn't Super Mario.

28:03.435 --> 28:06.555
I know your name is Super Cop
the one who upholds the law

28:06.675 --> 28:09.595
...and protect citizens from evil.

28:11.635 --> 28:14.595
Oh dear, it's a nice profession you do
I'm proud of you.

28:15.355 --> 28:18.595
Oh yes!
That's why you tell everyone I work at IBM?

28:18.675 --> 28:21.595
You want me to bring you all the neighbour's parking tickets?

28:22.635 --> 28:23.275
No.

28:23.675 --> 28:26.835
Ok, you work at IBM
It's our little secret..

28:27.635 --> 28:29.595
I get to fix all the neighbour's electronic toys.

28:29.715 --> 28:32.595
Never happy.
Oh Mum, I'm kidding!

28:33.635 --> 28:35.075
Can you call me a taxi?
I will be late.

28:35.275 --> 28:36.875
I just met a perfect one!

28:37.475 --> 28:39.675
Friendly, pleasant, the cream of the crop.

28:40.275 --> 28:41.075
You'll like him very much.

28:43.635 --> 28:44.355
Hello.

28:45.275 --> 28:45.995
Am I on the wrong floor?

28:46.155 --> 28:47.635
Depends on who you are looking for.

28:47.715 --> 28:48.675
Camille.

28:48.875 --> 28:50.355
That's me...
Him, I mean it's here.

28:50.475 --> 28:52.075
Ah you're her son, the one who works at Apple.

28:53.075 --> 28:54.595
IBM. IBM. Mum!

28:55.675 --> 28:57.635
You know I don't know anything about that stuff.
I recognised you from your photo,

28:58.675 --> 29:01.635
Ah Daniel, meet my son Emilien.

29:01.755 --> 29:05.355
I've put labels on them
Monday Veal, Tuesday...

29:05.515 --> 29:07.595
Ok mom, I promise, I'll be ok.

29:07.755 --> 29:10.635
Maybe we should go now
I get worried about leaving the car for long. Goodbye!

29:10.755 --> 29:12.475
Kiss.
Kiss, kiss mum!

29:14.675 --> 29:15.275
Where are we going?

29:15.475 --> 29:16.075
Voltaire Blvd.

29:17.475 --> 29:19.075
I remember the police station but not IBM.

29:19.275 --> 29:20.635
We are going to the police Station.

29:21.675 --> 29:23.675
I install computers there.

29:23.755 --> 29:27.675
If you don't mind, I'll drop you just before?
I don't really like hanging around the pigs.

29:34.715 --> 29:36.675
You know it makes a nice sound for a taxi.

29:37.275 --> 29:38.075
You know cars?

29:38.555 --> 29:39.515
Just a fan.

29:40.715 --> 29:44.635
It's a V6, a little bit modified.
It just loves to "sing"

29:45.715 --> 29:48.955
Don't sing too loud.
The speed limit is 50.

29:49.275 --> 29:50.675
You're talking about the signs saying 50?

29:51.275 --> 29:51.875
Yes.

29:52.715 --> 29:54.435
I thought it was for skateboards.

29:54.715 --> 29:56.675
No, no, I think it's for anything that drives.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.675
There is drive and "drive".
You see I'm at 100 in a good car...

29:59.795 --> 30:01.715
...good pilot, relaxed
No risks.

30:02.715 --> 30:05.475
I'm less dangerous at 100
then that shit at 20.

30:05.555 --> 30:06.515
There...

30:10.555 --> 30:11.555
See that?

30:12.515 --> 30:13.515
Yeah I saw it!

30:14.755 --> 30:16.075
You're not afraid of radars?

30:16.275 --> 30:17.275
We know where the radars are.

30:17.755 --> 30:22.675
Pigs are creatures of habit.
Always eat at the same places.

30:22.835 --> 30:25.715
See, there's one just there.
You see them, they are stupid!

30:26.755 --> 30:28.715
Picture! Picture!

30:29.755 --> 30:32.715
You know they are only doing their job.
They just obey orders.

30:33.755 --> 30:35.715
They volunteered,
nobody forced them.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.715
Sometimes I think they were forced to join.

30:37.835 --> 30:39.675
Because you need to be stupid
to join the police.

30:39.875 --> 30:40.715
Look,..

30:40.835 --> 30:42.755
...I see them a lot
...because of the computers.

30:42.835 --> 30:45.515
The image I had of them was false.

30:45.595 --> 30:47.555
Oh yeah? They're worse in person?

30:48.795 --> 30:53.515
No. They're better. There aren't
just plods in the police.

30:53.595 --> 30:56.715
Ah yeah, there's also alcoholics, crooks, idiots!

30:57.795 --> 30:59.755
Seriously, between us...

30:59.835 --> 31:04.275
...you know any normal person
who would want to join the Pigs?

31:05.475 --> 31:06.355
And taxi drivers?

31:06.675 --> 31:07.275
What about them?

31:07.675 --> 31:09.755
You know anybody who
would WANT to become a taxi driver?

31:09.875 --> 31:11.875
Those whinging guys who
only work when they feel like it?

31:12.275 --> 31:14.595
The ones who scream at us
when we don't have the right change..

31:15.555 --> 31:18.155
...and get abusive when we don't tip them.

31:18.675 --> 31:21.475
Always sneaking around being
really chummy with the police.

31:21.675 --> 31:23.275
Bunch of informers the lot of them.

31:24.875 --> 31:28.195
And they all marry widows
just to get a free house.

31:28.835 --> 31:30.555
Are you married to a widow?

31:30.635 --> 31:31.075
No...

31:31.275 --> 31:32.635
Ah I'm so reassured!

31:34.835 --> 31:38.075
Ok there may be a few drivers
who are rude to customers.

31:38.355 --> 31:39.475
But we are not all like you said.

31:40.875 --> 31:42.475
And with the police it's the same thing.

31:42.875 --> 31:45.795
They aren't all drunk at 6 in the morning,
beating up innocent people.

31:45.915 --> 31:49.275
Some of them do their jobs
Just like you... and me.

31:49.835 --> 31:51.795
Maybe, yeah maybe.

31:51.915 --> 31:54.075
But the problem is that taxi driving
isn't my real job.

31:55.275 --> 31:57.795
Ah you only do the taxi for fun...
What's your real job then?

31:58.315 --> 31:59.275
I'm going to show you.

32:28.275 --> 32:30.235
Do you have a bag?
I don't feel well.

32:30.875 --> 32:33.275
Don't worry. As long as we keep
moving nothing will come up.

32:43.875 --> 32:44.875
Shit!

32:46.875 --> 32:48.875
I'm sorry sir
it's the first time it's happened to me.

32:49.915 --> 32:53.875
Usually the client gets out
to walk a bit... then...

32:55.915 --> 32:57.075
I'm really sorry.

32:58.075 --> 32:58.875
I'm going to confess something.

33:00.875 --> 33:02.275
I'm like you. It's not my real job...

33:06.155 --> 33:07.075
Oh, no.

33:08.275 --> 33:09.155
Oh, yeah.

33:12.915 --> 33:15.275
Last name and first name.
Morales, Daniel.

33:15.915 --> 33:18.875
Profession. Shall I write crazy taxi driver
or just crazy driver?

33:19.915 --> 33:20.715
Whatever you want.

33:21.915 --> 33:25.915
What speed were you doing back there?
A little 90.

33:26.915 --> 33:28.075
A little 90.

33:28.275 --> 33:29.915
It felt worse than it was.
The motor really kicks

33:29.995 --> 33:31.755
but in reality the car doesn't go that fast.

33:35.955 --> 33:37.915
Eh, world champion, how's it going?
Fine, very good.

33:37.995 --> 33:39.915
Can't you leave me in peace?

33:40.955 --> 33:42.915
Remember that taxi?
We saw it 5 minutes ago on the avenue.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.915
Going 190 Km/h. He's slowing down!

33:48.955 --> 33:52.755
You see? Not 90... 190.

33:54.955 --> 33:57.915
Must be the sun.
I didn't see the 1 on the speedo.

33:58.955 --> 34:02.955
That's why I saw 90
If I'd known I would have slowed down.

34:03.955 --> 34:07.955
Anyway 90 is illegal.
The limit is 50... for everybody!

34:08.034 --> 34:10.955
Cars, skateboards,
taxis... everybody!

34:11.034 --> 34:14.955
Are you happy now? Caught me.
Did your little job. You can be happy now.

34:15.995 --> 34:20.275
My licence is my life
If I walk today I'm dead tomorrow.

34:20.995 --> 34:23.955
Are you going to be cool and finish this quickly.

34:24.995 --> 34:27.955
I'm going slowly, So I can enjoy it a bit.

34:28.074 --> 34:31.355
Usually I'm the one being screamed at all day.
For once I'm in luck.

34:31.995 --> 34:33.675
I didn't knock because of my wrist.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.875
It doesn't matter...
That you didn't knock I mean.

34:36.074 --> 34:36.955
Thank you.

34:37.275 --> 34:38.955
That dinner; your software that can't wait.
- Yes?

34:39.074 --> 34:41.755
Can it will wait until
I don't have any scarves.

34:41.835 --> 34:43.995
unless you want to have dinner
with a scarecrow.

34:44.074 --> 34:46.995
I doesn't bother me...
you're perfect Petra.

34:47.074 --> 34:49.995
It's not important... I mean no...
yes it matters

34:50.074 --> 34:54.755
It's important.
it's very bad for you...

34:54.835 --> 34:56.995
...but for me..
for the software it doesn't matter.

35:01.435 --> 35:04.995
You see!
All day it's been like that.

35:06.035 --> 35:07.995
If only I could catch
those German bastards.

35:09.035 --> 35:10.995
Can I go now?
It will make you feel better.

35:13.035 --> 35:16.995
No, I have to...
Unless you have an idea.

35:18.035 --> 35:20.995
Can I promise not to do it again?
I said an idea, not a lie.

35:21.115 --> 35:24.035
I'm talkin about a real idea
of public interest.

35:25.035 --> 35:26.675
You want to make me clean up dog shit?

35:27.075 --> 35:27.675
No!

35:29.075 --> 35:32.035
Something of public interest
for me. Understand?

35:33.075 --> 35:36.795
It's like I represent the public...

35:36.915 --> 35:40.035
...and you do something in my interest.

35:41.475 --> 35:42.475
You want money?

35:42.995 --> 35:43.875
Argh you're really stupid!

35:44.155 --> 35:48.035
Tell me clearly what you want.
I've had an hour of your yapping.

35:48.155 --> 35:49.475
What do you want?

35:49.555 --> 35:50.275
Listen.

35:51.075 --> 35:53.035
The Mercedes gang.
Rings a bell?

35:53.155 --> 35:55.035
No. The only gangs I know
are on scooters.

35:55.155 --> 35:58.035
They're a gang specialising in bank robbery.
Yesterday was their 7th.

35:58.155 --> 35:59.075
And that makes my boss sick.

35:59.275 --> 36:00.075
That's bad.

36:00.155 --> 36:03.875
Yes, mostly for us.
Listen, I've a proposal for you.

36:04.595 --> 36:07.075
You're a good mechanic and driver
and I need a driver.

36:07.155 --> 36:09.875
That's 3 good reasons to hire you
as an intern for 1 month.

36:10.875 --> 36:12.275
I tear up all your infractions.

36:12.915 --> 36:14.475
You want me to be a cop for 1 month?

36:14.875 --> 36:16.075
Choose, cop or pedestrian.

36:18.875 --> 36:19.875
Death or Shame?

36:20.875 --> 36:21.875
Yep, you understood well!

36:23.115 --> 36:26.075
Here you have all seven
attacks in order.

36:27.115 --> 36:30.075
Don't know much about Mercedes.
I'm more Ferrari.

36:30.195 --> 36:33.075
Right now the gang is "Mercedes"
but as soon they get in Ferrari, I'll call you.

36:35.115 --> 36:36.075
A red Mercedes. Horrible.

36:36.475 --> 36:39.675
Yeah red, look for something we don't know.

36:40.115 --> 36:44.115
We looked everywhere
but maybe... a detail.

36:45.115 --> 36:46.395
We just need a detail.

36:47.115 --> 36:49.955
Your gang.
They are German.

36:51.155 --> 36:56.075
Nice! Mercedes: Germans.
Want to relax 5 minutes now? You must be exhausted.

36:56.155 --> 36:58.115
Tyres are overinflated.
Typical of Germans.

36:58.195 --> 37:02.115
They use 8-inchers.
That had to be done in Germany 'cos you can't find it in France.

37:02.235 --> 37:05.115
The tyres are worn.
They will have to replace them soon.

37:05.675 --> 37:08.115
On this picture, the silencer is a little bent.
But not on this one.

37:08.475 --> 37:10.675
They must have bent it during a raid
and repaired it after.

37:11.155 --> 37:13.275
The only mechanic in Marseilles that repairs these is Kruger.

37:13.675 --> 37:15.875
And Kruger
...is German.

37:20.275 --> 37:22.075
Lucky you're not a Mercedes expert!

37:24.155 --> 37:25.075
Where are we going?

37:25.475 --> 37:27.955
We're starting with Kruger
to see if he remembers anything.

37:32.995 --> 37:35.475
What are you waiting for?
You want me to sing a song?

37:40.875 --> 37:43.275
In this neighbourhood, even the Christmas lights get stolen.

37:44.195 --> 37:45.475
What are we doing now?

37:46.475 --> 37:49.155
We're doing what takes up 80% of a policeman's life...

37:50.075 --> 37:51.155
...Observation.

37:52.195 --> 37:55.155
Familiarise yourself with the terrain,
observe entrances and exits

37:55.275 --> 37:57.155
...and analyse the situation.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.995
At closing time, we'll go and ask Kruger a few questions.

38:02.195 --> 38:02.995
When does the place close?

38:03.275 --> 38:06.195
Kruger's? He never closes; he's insomniac.

38:07.035 --> 38:07.995
Thanks!

38:10.235 --> 38:12.035
They didn't have anything else.

38:13.035 --> 38:15.195
Too bad we didn't stop by my mother's.
She makes terrific sandwiches.

38:17.235 --> 38:20.195
Ham and Cheese.
Half Bayonne, half Parisian.

38:21.235 --> 38:22.275
It's wonderful.

38:23.155 --> 38:24.075
She made you one?

38:24.275 --> 38:24.875
Yeah.

38:25.235 --> 38:29.235
A small slice of cheese in the middle
with lettuce.

38:30.075 --> 38:34.035
...and pickles.
Fabulous.

38:35.235 --> 38:38.035
That's mine.
Ah, really good, congratulations.

38:51.075 --> 38:52.755
What's he doing?
That's a Korean driver.

38:53.275 --> 38:56.715
A real pain in the ass in my job.
They work 24 hours a day.

38:57.075 --> 38:58.675
He must sleep sometime.
They are human.

38:59.675 --> 39:00.635
No, they have a "technique"

39:01.675 --> 39:04.235
One taxi, one plate,
one licence,...

39:06.275 --> 39:07.235
...and 2 drivers.

39:08.275 --> 39:10.875
Can you tell the difference between 2 Koreans?

39:11.675 --> 39:12.475
Incredible.

39:19.275 --> 39:23.275
I know a Korean who does food as a business.
Want some?

39:23.355 --> 39:26.035
No. we wait until he closes his garage.

39:26.115 --> 39:28.275
We'll be waiting a long time.
The guy is insomniac and never closes.

39:30.315 --> 39:33.275
How do you know that?
The bar owner.

39:34.315 --> 39:36.275
Why didn't you tell me before?

39:36.915 --> 39:39.275
I haven't been in the police force long.
I don't have the reflexes.

39:39.675 --> 39:42.275
It's not special to cops.
It's just common sense you idiot!

39:43.315 --> 39:45.875
We are here two fools
waiting for an insomniac to go to sleep!

39:46.315 --> 39:48.275
Does that sound logical to you?

39:50.315 --> 39:53.275
If I'm the Mercedes driver
and I know that the mechanic is insomniac...

39:53.395 --> 39:56.075
...I'll come during the night,
it's much more discrete.

39:56.155 --> 39:58.275
Oh yeah? You think that the driver will just show up...

39:58.395 --> 40:00.115
...with his nice Mercedes?

40:09.355 --> 40:10.315
I don't believe it!

40:11.155 --> 40:13.155
When a driver's not driving
he's always in a Garage.

40:14.355 --> 40:15.275
What are they doing there?

40:15.675 --> 40:17.315
Probably the 8-inch
tyres they ordered from Kruger.

40:18.355 --> 40:21.315
It's a miracle.
I can't let go such an opportunity.

40:22.355 --> 40:25.315
If it goes bad, call the station
and give the Mercedes plate numbers.

40:25.435 --> 40:27.315
Where are you going?
After information... and action.

40:28.355 --> 40:30.315
The Korean trick.
What?

40:30.435 --> 40:31.315
The Korean trick!

40:37.355 --> 40:39.315
What an idiot!

40:39.435 --> 40:41.315
The new tyres.
Where they are going to put them?

40:45.355 --> 40:47.355
What are you doing there?
Me? Sleeping.

40:48.395 --> 40:52.355
I don't have a house. My country is very cold.

40:53.395 --> 40:58.115
Please! Don't hurt me.
I just wanted to sleep.

40:58.235 --> 41:00.355
I'm going to take you to a house
where you'll sleep...

41:01.395 --> 41:03.355
and maybe even eat if you're lucky.

41:22.395 --> 41:24.875
Hey you're hurting me!
I'm doing my best.

41:30.435 --> 41:31.395
What is your name?
Daniel.

41:32.435 --> 41:35.395
Oh, yeah. Daniel.
I'm Emilien.

41:36.435 --> 41:38.275
We should call each other by name, it'll be better.

41:38.675 --> 41:39.395
Yeah better.

41:40.435 --> 41:44.395
Now that we are friends,
what just happened...

41:44.515 --> 41:46.395
stays between us...

41:49.435 --> 41:52.875
When you let go of my hand,
will I be able to go to sleep?

41:53.435 --> 41:55.395
I'm no insomniac or Korean.

41:57.275 --> 41:58.235
Certainly.

42:02.435 --> 42:04.435
I waited for you all night.

42:04.515 --> 42:06.435
It was deliberate,
so that you would really want me.

42:06.515 --> 42:08.435
You won't regret waiting.

42:09.475 --> 42:12.675
Promises, promises.
Let me see what you can do.

42:20.475 --> 42:22.435
Not too bad
a little bit more.

42:32.475 --> 42:34.435
What? What is going on?

42:34.555 --> 42:37.235
It's 6am and this is not Sunday.
It's Monday.

42:38.315 --> 42:40.835
You can't do that Lily.
I waited all night.

42:41.075 --> 42:42.475
And me? I played dominos

42:43.275 --> 42:44.275
Can't you call in sick?

42:44.315 --> 42:47.235
Sick on Monday morning?
My boss will really like that.

42:47.315 --> 42:49.235
No one ever got away with that.

42:49.315 --> 42:51.235
It can happen to anybody.
Being sick on Monday morning.

42:51.315 --> 42:54.235
You went to eat at your parents'.
You ate too much...

42:54.315 --> 42:56.235
...and you puked all night.
It's possible, isn't it?

42:56.355 --> 42:59.275
A man who works all week
and goes missing on Sunday.

42:59.675 --> 43:02.475
Do you think he can keep a relationship?

43:02.595 --> 43:05.875
I'm so sorry, Lily.
I had a shitty day.

43:06.515 --> 43:11.275
I promise that if you come to dinner here
tonight I'll explain everything.

43:12.515 --> 43:16.075
Ok, light meal
I don't want to be sick Tuesday morning.

43:16.195 --> 43:17.875
A short time at the table and a long time in bed.

43:18.515 --> 43:20.475
We could even eat in bed to save time.

43:21.515 --> 43:23.915
You'd better be good...
it's your last chance

43:25.315 --> 43:26.075
I'm going to impress you.

43:31.075 --> 43:33.075
We're going to wait all day
in front of the garage - again?

43:33.555 --> 43:36.075
We're done with observation,
Now it's interrogation.

43:37.555 --> 43:39.515
Are you interested in seeing
a real interrogation?

43:40.555 --> 43:42.515
No.
You're going to come anyway.

43:42.635 --> 43:46.515
I won't be any use. I'm better staying
with the taxi in case shit happens.

43:46.635 --> 43:50.075
I need a translator.
I don't want him to bamboozle me with technicalities.

43:50.275 --> 43:52.875
Kruger doesn't have a chance against me,
I'm telling you.

43:58.875 --> 43:59.875
Good morning gentlemen.

44:01.275 --> 44:03.075
Which one of you is called Kruger, please?

44:04.275 --> 44:06.555
It's written on the label
just like a waitress.

44:07.075 --> 44:09.555
Mr Kruger, I've
got a few questions.

44:10.475 --> 44:11.555
Don't worry
it won't be long.

44:37.595 --> 44:40.555
Fuck I'm out of ammo!
What for? They are long gone.

44:40.675 --> 44:43.595
Yeah? Open you eyes.
There's nobody here.

44:44.595 --> 44:45.595
Yeah, nobody.

44:48.635 --> 44:51.595
Can I ask you a quick question?
What?

44:51.675 --> 44:55.355
Are your interrogations
always like that, or was it to please me?

44:55.475 --> 44:56.595
Usually I ask at least one question.

44:57.635 --> 44:59.595
Let's get some air.

45:01.635 --> 45:02.675
You know, you saved my life.

45:02.875 --> 45:03.275
No.

45:03.475 --> 45:03.875
Yes.

45:04.635 --> 45:07.275
I owe you a big favour.
Lets forget that month's work...

45:07.635 --> 45:10.595
and turn it into a just a week.

45:10.715 --> 45:12.275
That your idea of a favour, huh?

45:12.475 --> 45:14.355
I need to catch that gang, it's important
to me.

45:14.475 --> 45:15.875
Because of the blonde chick?
No.

45:17.635 --> 45:20.395
In part yes,
but mostly for me, understand.

45:20.675 --> 45:22.635
I'm tired of spending nights
sorting garbage.

45:22.715 --> 45:25.635
It's a question of honour.
Maybe it's crazy, but I need this,

45:26.635 --> 45:29.635
Can I have the night off?
You're kidding - of course you have.

45:30.675 --> 45:32.635
Can I borrow him?
Mum...

45:32.715 --> 45:35.635
I lost my prescription
the doctor agreed to do another one.

45:35.715 --> 45:39.635
They are closing in 5 minutes.
It's my heart medecine.

45:40.675 --> 45:44.875
I won't let you die here.
This way I'll have saved the whole family today.

45:45.275 --> 45:46.475
You're so charming, Daniel.

45:46.675 --> 45:47.275
I know, I know.

46:00.675 --> 46:02.675
Look Johnny, here they come.
Don't worry baby.

46:02.755 --> 46:06.275
I've put a transmittter in that bullet
this way they can't get away.

46:07.675 --> 46:10.475
You're so clever Johnny
It's my job baby.

46:16.475 --> 46:18.675
Now we just have to follow them.

46:19.715 --> 46:21.675
Incredible!
...let's save your father.

46:23.275 --> 46:26.675
I'll never forget what you've done for me Johnny.
It's my job baby.

46:34.755 --> 46:37.675
Men,
we just received a call.

46:38.755 --> 46:40.675
They're really baiting us.

46:41.755 --> 46:43.715
Gonna be the Marseilles Bank.

46:44.755 --> 46:47.715
Since they are so precise with us,
I'm going to be so with you.

46:47.835 --> 46:50.715
I won't tolerate any misbehaviour... accidents
Nothing!

46:50.835 --> 46:52.715
Perfect coordination.

46:53.755 --> 46:55.755
I have two words for this mission...

46:55.835 --> 46:56.715
Serenity...

46:58.795 --> 46:59.755
...and efficiency.

47:01.795 --> 47:03.755
So I decided
to name this mission

47:04.795 --> 47:05.755
the Operation...

47:07.795 --> 47:08.755
...Zen.

47:11.795 --> 47:12.475
Chief!

47:12.635 --> 47:15.715
Forget the TinySnakes and Cobras
I just got the idea of the century.

47:15.875 --> 47:20.675
The Mercedes Gang will be nailed tonight
or I'm not called Emilien Barbadec.

47:29.795 --> 47:32.795
I hope your plan is foolproof
'cos this is your last shot.

47:35.835 --> 47:38.795
I giving you that shot
so be kind and don't miss.

47:43.835 --> 47:45.795
Everybody on the floor!
Quick!

47:45.875 --> 47:48.795
Hands on heads!

47:49.835 --> 47:51.795
Lie down! Don't move.

47:51.915 --> 47:53.595
Come on!

48:03.475 --> 48:05.675
Hey you! Get your head down!
Don't look at us!

48:11.835 --> 48:14.635
It's working.
Good, very good.

48:18.875 --> 48:21.275
Stay down all of you!

48:33.715 --> 48:34.675
Follow them at a distance.

48:45.875 --> 48:46.875
So you won't be scared.

49:03.475 --> 49:06.835
They stopped in Gauguin St.
We have them.

49:07.915 --> 49:09.875
Here is Gibert.

49:10.475 --> 49:13.675
All units: close off an area
10km around Gauguin St.

49:27.915 --> 49:29.915
They're not moving.
Same street.

49:38.755 --> 49:39.755
What's happening?

49:41.275 --> 49:42.275
The dot disappeared.

49:42.675 --> 49:43.915
I saw it disappear.

49:43.995 --> 49:45.275
I want you to find out why.

49:46.075 --> 49:47.635
They must be this way...

49:47.795 --> 49:49.875
...a red Mercedes
doesn't go by unnoticed.

50:04.955 --> 50:06.755
They're close, I can feel it.

50:08.955 --> 50:09.955
They are supposed to be here.

50:17.995 --> 50:19.955
Go, Go!

50:21.995 --> 50:23.795
Don't shoot.
I'm the hostage.

50:28.835 --> 50:29.795
Emilien...

50:30.995 --> 50:31.795
How...?

50:33.995 --> 50:35.955
I don't understand.
I'm missing something.

50:36.075 --> 50:38.955
A red Mercedes vanished.
Even Copperfield never did that.

50:43.995 --> 50:45.955
Good Day. Papers please

50:47.995 --> 50:49.595
What is happening officer?

50:49.995 --> 50:51.755
You're German?
Yes, why?

50:51.835 --> 50:52.955
Is this the frontier?

50:55.035 --> 50:57.755
Chief, 4 Germans in a Mercedes
not red. Interested?

50:57.835 --> 50:58.435
I'm taking it.

51:01.035 --> 51:03.995
So you're Germans.
Yes, is it a problem?

51:04.075 --> 51:06.995
No, it's good actually.
Open the trunk.

51:08.035 --> 51:10.995
What are you doing in Marseilles?
We came to spend Deutsch Marks...

51:11.115 --> 51:13.995
...but we can do that in another country if you prefer... No,...

51:14.115 --> 51:15.995
...I prefer that you keep that
in our territory.

51:23.035 --> 51:25.995
Ok goodbye.
Have a nice stay.

51:31.035 --> 51:32.035
Emilien.

51:33.035 --> 51:35.795
I don't understand, it's impossible.
I must have forgotten a detail.

51:36.075 --> 51:41.995
You see, he forgot the kettle.
You think so? That's not like him.

51:45.075 --> 51:49.355
It's 8pm. I've put on the answerphone,
set the alarm for 6 o'clock.

51:50.075 --> 51:51.675
We've got 10 hours.

51:52.275 --> 51:54.755
It should be enough
I think it's going to be tight...

51:54.875 --> 51:56.275
...but we can hurry a bit at the end.

52:01.915 --> 52:02.835
Expecting somebody?

52:03.075 --> 52:05.875
Yes my lover, but when you turned up
I cancelled.

52:09.675 --> 52:13.035
Who could it be?
Leave it, they will probably go away.

52:13.155 --> 52:16.075
Where were we?
I was kissing you.

52:17.915 --> 52:19.075
No you were kissing me.

52:24.115 --> 52:26.675
What if it's important?
How?

52:27.115 --> 52:29.075
I don't know... the cops.

52:29.195 --> 52:32.075
Ah yes, if you were a notorious criminal
and they came to get you.

52:32.195 --> 52:36.075
You could take me hostage.
Why don't you just take me?

52:38.115 --> 52:41.075
Open, Police!
You didn't kill anybody?

52:42.955 --> 52:43.915
No.

52:45.115 --> 52:46.915
God, Daniel!
Are you there!

52:48.115 --> 52:48.755
Fantastic!

52:49.115 --> 52:52.115
You can't imagine the shit I'm in.
Yes I can.

52:52.195 --> 52:54.115
No, no you can't.

52:55.155 --> 52:57.115
It's gone, we don't have a flat anymore.

52:57.195 --> 52:59.115
The flat that my father gave us.

53:00.155 --> 53:03.115
Gone up in smoke, just like my father.
My husband smoked a lot,...

53:03.195 --> 53:06.115
...but he died of liver cancer,
we never knew why - he didn't drink.

53:08.155 --> 53:11.115
The flat is nothing! The worst
is that I messed up again.

53:11.235 --> 53:14.115
If I don't catch them by the end of this week
I'm back on the beat next Monday.

53:15.155 --> 53:17.115
Stick, whistle, hello kids!

53:18.155 --> 53:19.955
I might as well die on Monday.

53:22.155 --> 53:24.115
Daniel, who's that dwarf?
A friend

53:24.235 --> 53:26.915
Yes?
Playing with smurfs now?

53:26.995 --> 53:29.155
It's a bit complicated,
he's a cop... What?

53:29.235 --> 53:31.155
You've got a friend in the police?
Not a real friend...

53:31.235 --> 53:33.155
I work for him, because..
You work for the cops?

53:33.235 --> 53:37.155
No, not for the cops, for him!
He's not really a cop,...

53:37.235 --> 53:41.155
...looks more like a secret agent.
Something like that.

53:41.235 --> 53:43.555
And the old lady is Mata Hari.

53:44.195 --> 53:47.155
Can someone explain to her?
I can't do it.

53:48.195 --> 53:50.155
Hi.
My name is Camille.

53:50.275 --> 53:53.155
The smurf sitting there
is my son, Emilien.

53:53.275 --> 53:56.915
Do you want to show me the kitchen?
I'll make some coffee.

53:57.035 --> 53:58.075
and explain everything.

53:58.355 --> 53:59.155
There is nothing to explain mum,...

53:59.275 --> 54:04.075
...I'm done, I'm on the street. It's finished.
But it started well...

54:05.195 --> 54:09.195
Then came the garbage bin, the butcher, the Mercedes...

54:09.275 --> 54:12.955
What are you going to do about them?
Want me to call the real cops?

54:13.035 --> 54:15.195
Be nice, don't complicate the situation
OK?

54:15.275 --> 54:16.955
I'm not complicating the situation.

54:17.035 --> 54:20.195
I just want to finish
what we started.

54:20.275 --> 54:23.195
I don't want to waste an hour
because our schedule is quite tight.

54:23.275 --> 54:26.955
I got caught at the harbour.
I mean seriously caught.

54:27.075 --> 54:29.195
I could loose my licence for 100 years.

54:29.315 --> 54:33.035
I help him and he gives me back my licence.
100 years of unemployment understand?

54:34.235 --> 54:36.195
Cop, Street-entertainer, Smurf

54:36.315 --> 54:38.675
Nice job, you could have killed him
before he ever got back to work.

54:39.235 --> 54:42.195
Here you go
it was stupid of me.

54:45.235 --> 54:48.235
I'm not kidding
you're free.

54:50.235 --> 54:50.875
Take it.

54:55.275 --> 54:58.235
Daniel, you know
I didn't came here for our deal.

54:59.275 --> 55:03.075
I haven't got any other friends
Mum told me you had a big heart.

55:06.275 --> 55:09.235
"Daniel has a big heart.
He'll help"

55:16.275 --> 55:18.235
Ok I think we made a mistake
it doesn't matter.

55:20.275 --> 55:23.235
It's not important. It's not your problem.

55:25.275 --> 55:27.235
Don't worry.
I'll catch the gang alone.

55:31.275 --> 55:34.675
On foot. Won't be easy
But I'm gonna do it.

55:42.315 --> 55:45.075
Listen, the best way to get rid of him
is to solve his problem.

55:45.315 --> 55:49.275
But he doesn't have "a" problem,
he's got tons.

55:49.395 --> 55:52.275
Look at his face,
he reminds me of "silence of the lambs".

55:53.315 --> 55:55.675
You look after Mata Hari
and I'll see to the Smurf.

55:55.875 --> 56:00.035
I'll be back in two hours.
And what do I do with her for two hours?

56:00.155 --> 56:01.275
Do we play bingo?
Please, Lily.

56:04.155 --> 56:06.075
If you're not back in two hours I burn the lady.

56:06.275 --> 56:07.275
It's a deal.

56:08.315 --> 56:10.315
Come on. Where are we going?
To solve your problem.

56:14.155 --> 56:16.315
I'm sorry to ruin your evening.

56:17.995 --> 56:19.475
You coffee any good?

56:20.475 --> 56:21.555
The best in town.

56:34.875 --> 56:37.915
A little coffee to lighten the atmosphere
and to find forgiveness.

56:42.875 --> 56:46.275
I know you don't want to talk to me anymore
But listen please.

56:46.875 --> 56:47.475
Ok?

56:48.075 --> 56:48.875
You have one minute.

56:49.355 --> 56:54.115
I was up all night thinking and
there was one question I couldn't answer.

56:54.195 --> 56:56.115
Why are they showing off to us?

56:56.195 --> 56:58.355
Why a red Mercedes
when grey is much more discreet?

56:59.395 --> 57:01.355
To get our attention:
look here, then...

57:03.395 --> 57:07.115
...it appears there.
It's a red herring.

57:07.235 --> 57:11.355
Conclusion: they left the building empty-handed
and the money took another road.

57:12.395 --> 57:14.355
Or maybe the money is still in the bank.

57:18.395 --> 57:20.355
One minute. Show's over.

57:27.395 --> 57:28.395
I'll be back later.

58:00.435 --> 58:02.395
Ten grand.
Thank you very much.

58:03.275 --> 58:04.675
To help pay the rent for the next few years.

58:05.475 --> 58:06.675
And my wife?

58:08.435 --> 58:12.675
You really want her back?
Well, I'm used to her now.

58:18.475 --> 58:21.435
Calm down dear.

58:23.475 --> 58:25.435
Now, everything's going to be fine.

58:33.475 --> 58:36.435
One other bank, and we retire

58:37.475 --> 58:42.675
And for the last one, I suggest a real masterpiece.

58:50.475 --> 58:53.475
Emilien. Emilien!
Leave me.

58:54.475 --> 58:58.235
If I tell you how they switched
from a red to a grey Mercedes.

58:58.315 --> 59:02.475
Go on...
They didn't change car, they changed colour.

59:03.515 --> 59:06.475
A red Mercedes enters a car park...

59:07.515 --> 59:10.475
...and a classic grey Mercedes
exits and drives away.

59:10.595 --> 59:13.235
It's possible.
Candy from a baby.

59:13.355 --> 59:16.475
If they did repaint the car
we would have found paint traces somewhere.

59:17.515 --> 59:20.475
Unless they used a truck
to spray the car in.

59:21.515 --> 59:25.275
They'd need to buy loads of paint
to do that each time.

59:25.355 --> 59:30.275
They did it really fast.
They had less than ten minutes. Is there a paint which dries in ten minutess?

59:30.355 --> 59:33.075
Hello, Gegé? Sorry for waking you up,
It's Daniel.

59:33.515 --> 59:36.075
I need your magic paint
the MD10.

59:37.275 --> 59:38.275
Metallic grey.

59:40.075 --> 59:44.275
You ran out?
Who could have bought all that in one shot?

59:45.555 --> 59:46.875
At the "circuit des étangs?"

59:47.555 --> 59:50.515
Why do they want that much paint?
To paint the circuit red?

59:51.555 --> 59:54.515
No, ok, don't worry
I'll try dealing with them.

59:55.555 --> 59:57.355
Talk to you soon. Thanks man.

59:59.555 --> 01:00:02.515
What does it mean MD10?
Dry in ten minutes.

01:00:16.395 --> 01:00:17.555
You like my theory?

01:00:24.075 --> 01:00:27.555
You think it's them? No those are the butchers
they train every Tuesday.

01:00:29.595 --> 01:00:31.555
Tell me Daniel.
what is your plan?

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:34.555
What are you doing?
We are going to say hi!

01:00:34.675 --> 01:00:37.555
They are going to see us.
Yep, we'll make sure they don't forget us.

01:00:37.675 --> 01:00:40.555
They will recognise me
they got a good look at me the other night.

01:00:41.595 --> 01:00:42.555
Put that on.
Oh shit.

01:00:45.435 --> 01:00:46.395
Is is ok like that?

01:00:47.595 --> 01:00:48.595
It's perfect.

01:00:51.595 --> 01:00:54.595
Hey faggots, everything ok?
Think you are Schumacher?

01:00:55.635 --> 01:00:58.595
Fancy a spin around the circuit?
What a cute little car.

01:00:59.275 --> 01:01:00.595
Mercedes?

01:01:01.635 --> 01:01:05.355
They build cars too?
Do Germans know how to play tortoise and hare?

01:01:05.475 --> 01:01:07.595
Don't know how to play?
I'll teach you.

01:01:07.675 --> 01:01:08.595
Give me fifty.

01:01:10.635 --> 01:01:13.595
Maybe I should get out now?
No, you'll enjoy this.

01:01:14.635 --> 01:01:16.595
The Tortoise and Hare works like this...

01:01:17.635 --> 01:01:20.995
...Fifty to anyone who can pass my car over two laps. One on one.

01:01:21.275 --> 01:01:23.395
You know how to count?
We don't want the money.

01:01:23.475 --> 01:01:26.395
I said fifty because I'd feel bad taking you for more.

01:01:26.635 --> 01:01:29.635
A tourist who doesn't get robbed
is not really a tourist is he?

01:01:29.715 --> 01:01:33.395
Check your rearview mirror in case I lap you
during the first lap.

01:01:33.475 --> 01:01:36.475
It will save you doing the second.

01:01:48.675 --> 01:01:49.475
Thanks girls!

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:54.635
Get lost
Quick!

01:01:55.675 --> 01:01:59.475
I hate to rush off but
I gotta go to the garage.

01:02:00.075 --> 01:02:02.075
I don't know what's wrong with my car
It doesn't run fast anymore.

01:02:03.675 --> 01:02:05.635
Whenever you want a rematch...

01:02:11.515 --> 01:02:13.675
Here's your fifty. What are we doing now?
Lets get a drink.

01:02:18.515 --> 01:02:19.515
Frogs...

01:02:20.795 --> 01:02:23.755
You're crazy we had the gang.
and you act the fool?

01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:27.755
We could have called backup and got them!
Yeah, on what charge?

01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:30.755
Speeding?.. on a circuit?
Oh, the evidence

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:32.755
Evidence comes later.
We are used to that.

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:35.755
We needed to catch them in the act,
That's what you said? Yes or no?

01:02:35.875 --> 01:02:38.515
For the moment it's us that break the law.

01:02:38.635 --> 01:02:41.755
If we carry on, it's us who will be jailed.

01:02:42.475 --> 01:02:43.875
I understand ok?

01:02:45.075 --> 01:02:46.275
You're going to get your bust.

01:02:46.835 --> 01:02:49.795
They are all warmed up.
And nobody enjoys a game more than a driver.

01:02:50.835 --> 01:02:53.515
Now we can set a
trap for them.

01:02:53.675 --> 01:02:56.555
Yeah? What kind of trap?
A trap for idiots.

01:02:56.675 --> 01:02:59.555
And what is your "idiot trap?"
Not an "Idiot Trap."

01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:02.555
I said "a trap"
Ok. how does it work?

01:03:02.675 --> 01:03:06.795
It goes like this
we bring them where we want.

01:03:06.915 --> 01:03:08.835
And that is: here.

01:03:09.835 --> 01:03:12.835
We will need 20 Traffic Light keys
and 20 Super Walkie-Talkies.

01:03:17.675 --> 01:03:20.635
Walkie-Talkie ok
but keys, the guys always carry them.

01:03:21.155 --> 01:03:22.235
Except when they take their shower.

01:03:26.875 --> 01:03:27.835
Oh no?
Oh yes.

01:03:27.915 --> 01:03:28.795
Oh no?
Oh yes.

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:56.875
You're talented!

01:03:57.915 --> 01:03:58.875
Here you go, Jimmy.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:08.475
Will it take long? I'm freezing.
One minute.

01:04:08.915 --> 01:04:09.875
Emilien, I got one...

01:04:10.915 --> 01:04:11.875
What are you doing naked?

01:04:15.915 --> 01:04:17.875
I'm not naked.
I've got a towel wrapped around me.

01:04:19.915 --> 01:04:21.875
And what do you care?

01:04:22.915 --> 01:04:24.875
I've got the right to be naked in my office, haven't I?

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:26.875
Isn't it my office?
Yes.

01:04:26.995 --> 01:04:29.915
No-one ever taught you to knock?

01:04:29.995 --> 01:04:32.635
You'll never learn anything idiot!

01:04:32.755 --> 01:04:35.875
Oh, what a welcome
I wanted to tell you a good joke.

01:04:35.995 --> 01:04:38.915
Your jokes are never funny.
Get out!

01:04:41.955 --> 01:04:43.475
Ah! That feels so good!

01:04:46.155 --> 01:04:46.755
COME IN!

01:04:47.795 --> 01:04:48.755
Petra...!

01:04:49.955 --> 01:04:50.875
Am I disturbing you?

01:04:51.875 --> 01:04:52.475
Never!

01:04:53.955 --> 01:04:55.915
Yes, I can see you're disturbed.
I'll come back later.

01:04:57.955 --> 01:05:01.915
The one time she comes in
with something to tell me...

01:05:02.955 --> 01:05:04.915
...I'm naked in the middle of the office.
You believe that Daniel?

01:05:05.955 --> 01:05:09.475
What can I say?
Anyway look at her...

01:05:09.875 --> 01:05:11.915
She's so beautiful.
She's already a Sergeant.

01:05:12.955 --> 01:05:14.955
What could she see in a guy like me?
Ho, ho. Enough.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:20.715
You done whining?
You've started digging your grave already.

01:05:20.795 --> 01:05:24.715
She's not a charity.
A chassis like that doesn't run on petrol.

01:05:24.835 --> 01:05:26.715
What she need is a MAN.

01:05:26.835 --> 01:05:28.915
Straighten up.
You look like a monkey.

01:05:29.995 --> 01:05:30.795
Stand up straight!

01:05:32.995 --> 01:05:36.915
Now you go see her and you kiss her.

01:05:37.995 --> 01:05:40.955
You either get a slap in the face or
you get her for the next ten years.

01:05:41.075 --> 01:05:44.275
There's a 50/50 chance.
If it doesn't work at least you'll know.

01:05:44.875 --> 01:05:46.795
It's like a game show.
You win or you lose.

01:05:48.995 --> 01:05:51.475
Are you ok, Emilien?
Are you ok?

01:05:53.795 --> 01:05:55.475
You are right.
I shouldn't worry.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.835
I've got to go for it
I got it.

01:06:12.475 --> 01:06:14.875
It was 50/50.
He will get other chances.

01:06:18.035 --> 01:06:19.395
Where are we with the keys?
Done!

01:06:21.675 --> 01:06:22.235
Take them.

01:06:23.035 --> 01:06:24.475
You think she's going to be angry?

01:06:25.835 --> 01:06:28.395
A girl shows up 17 hours late.
What do you do?

01:06:29.555 --> 01:06:31.435
I kill her.
So you have your answer!

01:06:32.035 --> 01:06:33.835
But we've got flowers.

01:06:34.875 --> 01:06:36.995
Oh the nice flowers!
Can we smoke them?

01:06:41.075 --> 01:06:43.035
You bake all those cakes?
Yes.

01:06:44.075 --> 01:06:47.035
Since we couldn't make love,
we got revenge with cakes.

01:06:49.075 --> 01:06:50.035
What a crisis!

01:06:51.075 --> 01:06:54.035
Thanks, Camille.
I had a wonderful day.

01:07:01.675 --> 01:07:03.675
Sweet smelling flowers.
Thanks. Goodbye.

01:07:06.075 --> 01:07:08.035
You don't want to make love?

01:07:08.675 --> 01:07:10.835
You have visitors.
You have to take care of them.

01:07:10.915 --> 01:07:13.835
Another day, another year.
It makes no difference.

01:07:13.915 --> 01:07:15.835
Camille will be in your bed.
Her back hurts.

01:07:20.115 --> 01:07:21.075
Good night boys.

01:07:30.915 --> 01:07:33.675
God, it's good stuff.
Sure it's Jamaican.

01:07:34.115 --> 01:07:37.075
You see. It's not all bad in the police.
Stop it you are tempting me.

01:07:39.915 --> 01:07:42.875
Why didn't you race professionally
instead of doing it with a taxi?

01:07:44.955 --> 01:07:47.675
My father spent is life in a wheelchair
because of a car accident.

01:07:49.675 --> 01:07:51.515
How could I explain to him I wanted to be a racing driver.

01:07:52.515 --> 01:07:53.315
I see.

01:07:54.475 --> 01:07:56.275
And you? What did you do
to end up so badly?

01:07:57.675 --> 01:07:58.955
My story's not so bad.

01:08:00.155 --> 01:08:03.115
My dad died when I was 17,
We were alone, mother and I.

01:08:03.995 --> 01:08:05.515
So I had to go to work right away.

01:08:06.995 --> 01:08:08.955
Without a degree, only the cops will take you.

01:08:12.155 --> 01:08:14.115
Where did you live?
At Asnières.

01:08:15.155 --> 01:08:17.115
At Jules Ferry?
Yes. Why?

01:08:19.154 --> 01:08:19.875
You too?

01:08:20.475 --> 01:08:21.875
Yes, I swear.

01:08:22.154 --> 01:08:24.515
It's crazy
we could have ended up in the same class.

01:08:26.154 --> 01:08:29.675
I would have taught you to steal bikes.
You would have turned out better!

01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:35.875
Life is like that. You dream about so many things
when you are a kid but finally...

01:08:36.274 --> 01:08:37.475
...nothing goes as planned.

01:08:40.274 --> 01:08:42.354
You dream of playing in front
you end up goalie.

01:08:44.835 --> 01:08:46.475
You think our plan is going to work?

01:08:49.194 --> 01:08:50.154
It will roll.

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:53.955
Are you sure?

01:08:55.675 --> 01:08:56.475
Come in.

01:08:58.875 --> 01:08:59.675
Am I disturbing you?

01:09:00.875 --> 01:09:04.075
No, it's ok.
What do you need?

01:09:04.475 --> 01:09:05.154
Red Alert!

01:09:10.595 --> 01:09:12.475
Guys, the Plan Cougar is under way.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:14.875
Their target is the S.D.L.M..

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:17.955
Here are your positions
for today.

01:09:18.035 --> 01:09:20.875
Arthur, at the crossroads Nº1.

01:09:21.274 --> 01:09:22.075
Jacky, Nº2,...

01:09:22.274 --> 01:09:25.435
...at National Flamarion crossroads.
Momo at the crossroads de Le Beché.

01:09:28.075 --> 01:09:31.675
Nº2, radio and key.
Nº3, radio and key. Nº4...

01:09:54.675 --> 01:09:55.275
Yes?

01:09:56.275 --> 01:09:58.235
I know. You'll be back in an hour.
...exactly.

01:09:59.675 --> 01:10:01.275
I'll wait for you at your place.

01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:22.875
Cougar speaking
the bird is in the cage.

01:10:23.875 --> 01:10:26.235
Everybody quiet!
On your knees!

01:10:32.875 --> 01:10:34.875
Cougar speaking. the bird will soon get out of his cage.

01:10:35.875 --> 01:10:36.675
Prepare yourselves.

01:10:38.115 --> 01:10:41.275
Shit they have hostages,
Don't do anything for the moment.

01:10:42.315 --> 01:10:44.075
No more room for you.

01:10:44.475 --> 01:10:45.475
Ok no problem.

01:10:46.315 --> 01:10:50.475
You're going to run next to the car.
It won't be too bad

01:10:51.075 --> 01:10:52.115
I'm tired!

01:11:00.875 --> 01:11:04.275
Bastards! All Cougar units advance!
Catch the birds.

01:11:04.675 --> 01:11:05.675
Catch the birds!

01:11:28.195 --> 01:11:30.155
You see it's not the Mercedes we needed to follow...

01:11:31.275 --> 01:11:33.075
It's the truck we needed to follow.

01:11:33.355 --> 01:11:35.315
This deserves a toast!

01:11:35.835 --> 01:11:37.275
And now we can all go home!

01:11:38.075 --> 01:11:39.675
Cheers! Cheers!

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:52.875
Let's party.

01:12:02.395 --> 01:12:05.355
Everything's ready?
Twenty strategic points blocked.

01:12:05.435 --> 01:12:07.675
If they cross any of these junctions
they are caught like rats.

01:12:08.075 --> 01:12:10.155
They're taking Michelet Boulevard,
they're going to Place Mazard.

01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:12.355
Who's on that corner?

01:12:12.475 --> 01:12:15.675
Jean-Bat, Nº7.
Call him. He will be the opening act.

01:12:16.235 --> 01:12:17.755
Nº7, Jean-Bat.
You hear me?

01:12:19.275 --> 01:12:21.755
Yes, listening.
You're going to be first. You in position?

01:12:22.275 --> 01:12:23.275
Yes no problem.

01:12:23.675 --> 01:12:24.875
It's our turn now.

01:12:28.075 --> 01:12:29.275
It won't fit.

01:12:29.675 --> 01:12:30.475
Nag, nag...

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:34.875
Hey Bavarians, how are you
Still in your tractor?

01:12:35.435 --> 01:12:38.875
Sorry about the last time.
I forgot the handbrake. That's why I was so slow.

01:12:39.435 --> 01:12:41.675
Hey I'm telling you.
It's a lot better now.

01:12:42.075 --> 01:12:44.475
Want to do another Tortoise/Hare or you just chicken?

01:12:45.435 --> 01:12:48.395
Ok, you Frogs
always got a big mouth

01:12:48.515 --> 01:12:51.075
Come on the motorway with me & we'll see!
Did I upset you?

01:12:51.515 --> 01:12:53.275
I'm going to blow up your Peugeot!
I did upset you.

01:12:53.675 --> 01:12:54.675
I'm sorry, very sorry.

01:12:55.275 --> 01:12:57.915
I'll give you another chance,
but I won't bet much this time.

01:12:57.995 --> 01:13:02.395
I feel bad taking money from you so easily.
Here you go my baby, 10F.

01:13:03.435 --> 01:13:06.675
You're going to pay for your insolence.
Better to be insolent than ridiculous!

01:13:09.675 --> 01:13:11.075
I think you over did it a bit.

01:13:11.275 --> 01:13:13.275
Not at all,
Tell 7, 8 and 9 to go red.

01:13:13.875 --> 01:13:14.875
Jean-Bat, go on red now.

01:13:39.275 --> 01:13:42.075
Nº10, in position.
Nº11, in position.

01:13:42.275 --> 01:13:44.675
Perfect. 12 and 13, prepare yourselves.

01:13:47.275 --> 01:13:49.875
This is Nº13,
I've got a small problem.

01:13:51.075 --> 01:13:52.875
There are two cops standing at the light.

01:13:53.075 --> 01:13:53.475
Shit!

01:13:54.075 --> 01:13:54.875
Move them!

01:13:55.275 --> 01:13:58.075
Easy for you to say! They set up home.

01:14:03.275 --> 01:14:05.675
We are nearly there. Sort it out
or we are done for.

01:14:07.515 --> 01:14:09.075
Pollo, let me talk to the cops.

01:14:10.515 --> 01:14:12.475
Excuse me sir, it's for you.

01:14:13.875 --> 01:14:14.355
Hello.

01:14:14.475 --> 01:14:18.075
This is Gibert.
We found a bomb and it's right next to you.

01:14:18.515 --> 01:14:20.475
Where?
In the traffic light.

01:14:21.275 --> 01:14:23.275
Stay calm
we know how to defuse it.

01:14:23.515 --> 01:14:27.275
Listen carefully. Put the key in the light
and make the light turn red.

01:14:27.475 --> 01:14:28.675
It's already red!

01:14:28.875 --> 01:14:31.275
Don't worry about the colour

01:14:31.595 --> 01:14:33.515
...just turn the key to the right!

01:14:33.595 --> 01:14:35.915
Yes, yes, Mr Commissioner.

01:14:44.075 --> 01:14:45.275
We've just passed 12.

01:14:45.675 --> 01:14:47.275
Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:14:48.075 --> 01:14:48.915
Let me do it!

01:14:52.395 --> 01:14:55.075
19 and 20, get ready. 20 is the last.

01:14:55.275 --> 01:14:56.075
I know.

01:15:09.075 --> 01:15:10.275
Are you sure this is the right road?

01:15:10.675 --> 01:15:11.675
It's a shortcut.

01:16:11.635 --> 01:16:15.675
The motorway! They're dead meat.
We have more power.

01:16:54.075 --> 01:16:55.835
What was that fence for Daniel..?

01:16:56.075 --> 01:16:57.675
The motorway isn't finished. It's a dead end.

01:17:00.675 --> 01:17:02.875
The fact that you know that
doesn't reassure me.

01:17:05.275 --> 01:17:07.675
I may look calm to you
but I'm crapping it here..

01:17:07.875 --> 01:17:08.675
Not long. now..

01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:10.475
That's what worries me,
I wanted a long life.

01:17:10.875 --> 01:17:11.475
Ten seconds.

01:17:11.515 --> 01:17:12.675
Squash that rat!

01:17:15.075 --> 01:17:16.475
Stop. There's no bridge!

01:17:16.675 --> 01:17:17.275
Five seconds.

01:17:19.275 --> 01:17:21.475
GO! Trash him! Trash him!

01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:23.835
Let them win Daniel.

01:17:24.075 --> 01:17:26.875
You only bet 10F. I don't want to die for it.

01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:28.475
It's now or never! Hold on!!!

01:17:37.715 --> 01:17:40.275
Excellent, Karl!
We won!

01:17:42.115 --> 01:17:43.475
Are you sure?

01:17:53.115 --> 01:17:54.715
I swear, you scared me to death!

01:17:56.155 --> 01:17:58.715
I really thought
you'd rather die than lose.

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:01.715
With the tortoise and the hare,
it's always the tortoise who wins!

01:18:03.475 --> 01:18:06.115
Einstein! You know "La Fontaine?"

01:18:07.275 --> 01:18:08.875
That damn shit! Goddamn!

01:18:09.675 --> 01:18:10.475
Damned...

01:18:10.875 --> 01:18:12.075
...shithead!

01:18:15.275 --> 01:18:19.675
The big hare is not happy to be
fucked by the little tortoise.

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:25.715
Cougar will be happy.
He's wanted to taste hare for a long time.

01:18:26.235 --> 01:18:28.395
Ja, ja... big hare
big hare.

01:18:49.075 --> 01:18:50.275
I'm sorry about this place.

01:18:52.275 --> 01:18:53.075
It's not very romantic.

01:18:54.275 --> 01:18:55.275
But I wanted you so much.

01:18:55.475 --> 01:18:56.275
Truly?

01:18:56.795 --> 01:18:58.075
I was starting to wonder...

01:19:01.875 --> 01:19:02.555
Shall we do it again?

01:19:04.795 --> 01:19:08.275
Later.
We have to go now.

01:19:12.595 --> 01:19:15.275
Daniel, What are you doing?
I've been looking for you for 15 minutes.

01:19:15.835 --> 01:19:17.075
What were you doing in the dark?

01:19:17.475 --> 01:19:18.555
Developing photos.

01:19:18.635 --> 01:19:21.635
This is not the time for photos.
The Commissioner is waiting!

01:19:30.675 --> 01:19:32.195
In the name of the President of the Republic

01:19:32.315 --> 01:19:35.875
...it is my privilege to present to you
the Knight's Order of National Merit.

01:19:43.075 --> 01:19:43.635
Congratulations.

01:19:52.875 --> 01:19:54.075
I owe you an apology.

01:19:54.875 --> 01:19:56.675
For not believing in me or for slapping me?

01:19:57.275 --> 01:19:59.275
Both.
Can you ever forgive me?

01:20:02.275 --> 01:20:03.275
I'll think of a way...

01:20:05.675 --> 01:20:07.075
I read about your exploits.

01:20:08.475 --> 01:20:09.075
Amazing!

01:20:10.075 --> 01:20:13.075
This experience made us think.
Thanks.

01:20:14.475 --> 01:20:16.835
We are going to change the way we see the road.

01:20:16.955 --> 01:20:19.275
...create a more efficient police force.

01:20:19.475 --> 01:20:20.075
Modernise.

01:20:20.275 --> 01:20:21.075
All thanks to you.

01:20:21.275 --> 01:20:22.275
Thank you sir.

01:20:22.875 --> 01:20:27.275
The medal is only a symbol.
It won't get your licence back.

01:20:27.675 --> 01:20:29.075
I was hoping for more...

01:20:29.275 --> 01:20:29.875
Mercy?

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:30.875
Yes, that would be good.

01:20:31.275 --> 01:20:34.635
We had evidence to put you in
jail for years. But you are free.

01:20:34.715 --> 01:20:35.875
I'm not free. I'm on foot.

01:20:36.875 --> 01:20:37.675
I understand.

01:20:37.915 --> 01:20:39.875
Without a car
you are like an orphan.

01:20:40.275 --> 01:20:41.475
Yes an pedestrian orphan.

01:20:41.875 --> 01:20:42.675
I understand.

01:20:43.475 --> 01:20:45.475
I have a solution
but I'm not sure you will like it.

01:20:47.915 --> 01:20:49.675
Tell me and we'll see.

01:21:00.715 --> 01:21:01.675
So are you happy or not?

01:21:01.875 --> 01:21:02.475
Yes.

01:21:02.875 --> 01:21:03.675
You're not happy?

01:21:03.875 --> 01:21:04.875
Yes it's super.

01:21:05.075 --> 01:21:08.915
I don't understand. First Grand Prix.
First grid, super car, friends,...

01:21:08.995 --> 01:21:11.475
...beautiful girlfriend. What's wrong?

01:21:11.875 --> 01:21:13.475
The sponsor!

01:21:14.715 --> 01:21:18.315
We find him money, a car
and still he's unhappy.

01:21:21.555 --> 01:21:25.475
Tell the cheerleaders to stop waving their pom-poms.
It distracts me.

01:21:25.795 --> 01:21:28.475
You know what you could do
to make me happy?

01:21:28.675 --> 01:21:29.475
Yeah? What?

01:21:29.795 --> 01:21:33.475
Win the race! It doesn't matter a damn
which sponsor's name is on the car.

01:21:34.955 --> 01:21:38.275
Ok then, Take the Champagne out of
the fridge 'cos I don't like it too cold.

01:21:44.955 --> 01:21:46.915
Let's go, Daniel!
