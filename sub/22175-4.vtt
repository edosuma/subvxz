not only did he finish,

09:51.123 --> 09:52.992

<i>and so natural-looking.</i>

09:56.562 --> 09:58.364
- Unlike Nick.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.767
<i>- What he did, basically,</i>
<i>was just blast a whole bunch</i>

10:01.834 --> 10:05.204

<i>the wenis of the elbow.</i>

10:05.271 --> 10:08.274
- Right on that wenis.
- It's never going to hold.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.943
<i>- I actually did</i>
<i>like his design.</i>

10:11.010 --> 10:12.611
- Whitney made some
smarter choices

10:12.678 --> 10:13.846
with her design overall.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.715
<i>- She knew that if she got</i>

10:15.781 --> 10:20.252
<i>nothing else done, she was</i>
<i>gonna have solid linework.</i>

10:20.319 --> 10:21.620
<i>The problem that I have,</i>
<i>though,</i>

10:21.687 --> 10:23.889
is when you stand back from it,

10:23.956 --> 10:25.725
it's pretty hard to read.

10:25.791 --> 10:29.628
<i>- If she would've put a little</i>
<i>bit of black behind some</i>

10:29.695 --> 10:32.932
<i>of the flowers, it would've</i>
<i>been a lot more readable.</i>

10:32.999 --> 10:34.767
But all three of them finished,

10:34.834 --> 10:37.937

the ones that I most doubted.

10:38.004 --> 10:40.006

see on that tattoo is black.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.845

you didn't look at it.

10:45.911 --> 10:47.446

10:47.513 --> 10:48.948

that is not a good tattoo.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.049

10:50.116 --> 10:51.917

10:51.984 --> 10:54.687
You did nothing but literally
black out this chick's elbow.

{\an1}I don't think arrogance
will get you very far in here.

11:05.131 --> 11:07.733
- Arrogance is not
arrogance if it's confidence.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.535
And confidence
is earned by success.

11:09.602 --> 11:10.703

26:44.202 --> 26:46.237

be a really tough competition,

26:48.073 --> 26:49.841

how I do against you.

26:49.908 --> 26:51.710

better you than me.

26:54.612 --> 26:57.048

27:02.120 --> 27:03.621

27:34.119 --> 27:38.323
you guys are gonna be tattooing
whatever your canvases want.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.792
Like many metropolitan areas,

27:40.859 --> 27:44.629
Seattle has a huge
homeless population.

27:44.696 --> 27:46.765
Every day,
thousands of people find

27:46.831 --> 27:50.168
themselves sleeping outside,
or in a shelter.

27:50.235 --> 27:54.272
Your canvases today have
had that exact experience.

guys tell us all a little bit

28:01.646 --> 28:03.448

- Well, my name is Alicia.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.983
I was homeless and pregnant.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.851
I chose to give my
daughter up for adoption.

28:06.918 --> 28:09.954
Since then, I have reconnected
with my little girl.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.690
I have two beautiful sons,
and I'm a flight attendant

28:12.757 --> 28:14.225

28:14.292 --> 28:15.727
- Cool, that's amazing.
- That's amazing.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.829
- Awesome.
- My name is Vonsetta,

28:17.896 --> 28:21.099
and I was homeless
for over ten years.

28:21.166 --> 28:24.736
And I lived a life
of crime and violence.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.871
But since then I've
worked really hard at

28:26.938 --> 28:29.908

and now I own my own business.

28:29.974 --> 28:31.276

- Nice to meet you.

29:05.844 --> 29:07.045

29:07.112 --> 29:08.646
- I'm fine.
- All right.

29:08.713 --> 29:10.348
{\an3}- Let's talk about
what we're gonna do today.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.517
- When I was 17,
I walked away from my family.

29:12.584 --> 29:16.221
{\an3}I ended up pregnant,
and in a homeless situation.

29:16.287 --> 29:19.524
{\an3}If it wasn't for a local
organization here, I would have

29:19.591 --> 29:21.759
probably ended up a lot worse.

29:21.826 --> 29:23.128
They gave me the courage

29:23.194 --> 29:25.163
{\an3}to give my daughter
up for adoption.

29:28.233 --> 29:31.703
{\an3}Which at 17, is not a decision
anyone should have to make.

29:31.769 --> 29:33.905
{\an3}Because of that,
it's how I was able to get

29:33.972 --> 29:36.207
{\an3}the strength to go
back to college.

29:36.274 --> 29:39.144
{\an3}I can get the dream job
I've wanted for a long time.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.446
{\an1}- You seem like
an incredibly brave woman,

29:41.513 --> 29:44.616
{\an1}and I want that to come forward
in your tattoo, for sure.

29:44.682 --> 29:46.651
{\an3}- Nice.
It's what I need.

29:46.718 --> 29:48.219
- I was homeless
for a long time.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.155
I was on drugs really heavy.

29:50.221 --> 29:51.623
I lost my kids.

29:51.689 --> 29:53.391
{\an1}As I remember what my
kids looked like when they

29:53.458 --> 29:56.427
{\an1}were in the car screaming
for me as they were taken off,

29:56.494 --> 29:58.863
and that was very hard.

29:58.930 --> 30:00.298
- That was motivation

30:00.365 --> 30:02.000
for you to--
- Actually, it didn't.

30:02.066 --> 30:04.269
{\an1}The drug was calling me
more than me missing my kids.

30:04.335 --> 30:05.870
- Well,
it'll get a hold of you.

30:05.937 --> 30:07.505
{\an1}- I was running
the streets, being wild, and I

30:07.572 --> 30:10.408
struggled with a lot of crime.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.710
I did 22 months, and I got out.

30:12.777 --> 30:14.546
{\an1}I got a job.
I got my own place.

30:14.612 --> 30:16.080
I have a beautiful relationship

30:16.147 --> 30:18.216
{\an1}with all my kids now,
and I've come a long way.

30:18.283 --> 30:20.018
- Never look back.
- Mm-mmm.

30:20.084 --> 30:22.520
{\an3}- Today, we are going
to do something that's gonna be

30:22.587 --> 30:24.822
a reminder of where you're
from and who you are today.

30:24.889 --> 30:26.858
- Well,
I'm thinking of a cocoon,

30:26.925 --> 30:31.462
with a lady coming out with
butterfly wings, as a symbol

30:31.529 --> 30:33.665
{\an1}of being set free
from the past.

30:33.731 --> 30:34.899
- Rebirth.
- Rebirth.

30:34.966 --> 30:36.267
- Something, something new.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.036
A new page in life.
- Exactly.

30:38.102 --> 30:40.205
{\an8}- My canvas wants a lot
of elements in this tattoo.

30:40.271 --> 30:43.608
I need to design this tattoo
in a way that is going to make

30:43.675 --> 30:47.312
my canvas very happy,
and then also be a competition

30:47.378 --> 30:48.947
worthy to go against Nikki.

30:49.013 --> 30:53.184
{\an1}- I'm really excited to show
you what I have drawn up.

30:53.251 --> 30:54.953
- Oh, my God.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.689
{\an1}- I wanted to convey
a strong and powerful woman.

30:57.755 --> 31:01.459
{\an3}- That's actually
pretty spot-on.

31:01.526 --> 31:04.562
{\an1}- I am so excited
to start this tattoo for you.

31:04.629 --> 31:06.798
Are you ready?
- Yes, absolutely.

31:06.864 --> 31:08.733
{\an3}- I really liked
your idea, and I didn't want

31:08.800 --> 31:10.935
{\an3}to stray from that,
especially with as much

31:11.002 --> 31:12.804
meaning as this has for you.

31:12.870 --> 31:14.706
{\an3}We were able to capture the
woman coming out of the cocoon.

31:14.772 --> 31:16.374
- Oh, my God.

31:16.441 --> 31:17.775
- And she's ready to roll
out of this thing and fly.

Graydon's tattoo
has a lot of detail.

35:28.259 --> 35:31.295
The wings, it's beautiful.
And it's much bigger.

35:31.362 --> 35:35.166

36:38.829 --> 36:41.666
- I like Graydon's tattoo.
I think it's awesome.

36:41.732 --> 36:43.968
- I like how her
hair matches the chrysalis.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.070
That's really, really nice.
<i>- I love the detail in it.</i>

36:46.137 --> 36:49.240
The wings look fantastic, and I
just feel a connection to it.

36:50.508 --> 36:52.610
- Nikki's tattoo is better
because of the shading in it.

36:52.677 --> 36:54.679
<i>I like the little details that</i>
<i>she's putting inside of there.</i>

36:54.745 --> 36:56.447
- That's super creative.

36:58.249 --> 37:00.551

is more imaginative.

37:00.618 --> 37:03.154
It has a really
detailed concept.

37:08.793 --> 37:10.494

think about Nikki's tattoo?

highlights done perfectly.

to see if she had
enough time to put it in there.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.437
- Yeah, definitely.
I think she could've gone--

37:19.503 --> 37:21.072
- I think she
could've gone bigger.

37:21.138 --> 37:22.807
<i>- Yeah,</i>
<i>just a little bit more to it,</i>

37:22.873 --> 37:24.508
you know, just the extra punch.
- Unlike Graydon.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.043
<i>He went big,</i>
<i>and he pushed himself.</i>

37:26.110 --> 37:27.578
<i>The top half is great.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

37:27.645 --> 37:29.213
<i>- The leaves,</i>

37:29.280 --> 37:30.815
<i>- You can see it</i>
<i>from a good distance.</i>

37:30.881 --> 37:32.617
{\an3}It's very bold.
But I'm not gonna lie.

37:32.683 --> 37:34.885
Down at the bottom, there's
a lot of readability issues.

37:34.952 --> 37:36.654
- Yeah.
- He might have rushed

37:36.721 --> 37:38.656
<i>a little bit of</i>
<i>the black shading on the body,</i>

37:38.723 --> 37:40.391

the separation between the hair

<i>And if she popped</i>

the eye would have had a direct

Graydon showed us a lot

Graydon simply ran out of time.
