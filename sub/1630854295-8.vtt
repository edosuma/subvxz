00:01.335 --> 00:03.303
Tonight,
Daniel Lubetzky, the founder of

00:03.403 --> 00:04.838
ground-breaking
snack company Kind,

00:04.938 --> 00:06.139
returns to the Tank.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.742
I love you, man, because
you're hanging by a thread

00:08.842 --> 00:10.244
and you don't give up.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.879
Never play with your food.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.248
But food is so much fun
to play with.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.618
Devastating wildfires are
taking over many parts of our country.

00:17.718 --> 00:18.986
John C.: You can get
a real bird's-eye view

00:19.086 --> 00:20.020
thanks to my invention.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.089
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.258
We average about a million
a week on TikTok.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.093
My biggest video
is 16 million.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.228
It's going to take time
for people to understand this.

00:28.328 --> 00:29.363
Are you patient?

00:29.463 --> 00:31.164
I was made to be
an entrepreneur,

00:31.265 --> 00:33.600
and I don't want to do
anything else with my life.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.736
The product is
completely nuts.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.004
I told myself
I wasn't gonna cry,

00:37.104 --> 00:39.106
but, like,
I-I have no other choice.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.413
Thank you.
Okay, we're going to
do this, John.

00:46.513 --> 00:47.948
Have fun.
We are.
We're going to do it.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.750
Let's do it.
Confidence. Here we go.
Let's do it all.
Just for us.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.318
We're gonna kick their ass.
Yeah, we are.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.223
First in the Tank
is a unique way

00:56.323 --> 00:59.126
to get up close
and personal with nature.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.603
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Joan.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.772
And I'm John.
We're from Loveland, Colorado.

01:11.872 --> 01:15.542
We're seeking $75,000
for 10% of our company.

01:15.642 --> 01:18.679
Sharks, one of nature's
most magnificent creatures

01:18.779 --> 01:20.314
is the hummingbird.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.982
You ever seen one up close?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.151
I mean, like,
really up close?

01:24.251 --> 01:25.285
Well, they fly so fast,

01:25.385 --> 01:27.955
it's almost impossible
to see their beauty.

01:28.055 --> 01:30.657
But now you can get
a real bird's-eye view,

01:30.757 --> 01:32.259
thanks to my invention.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.098
The HummViewer!

01:38.198 --> 01:40.901
Oh, no.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.303
The HummViewer's a one-of-a-
kind hummingbird feeder

01:43.403 --> 01:44.905
that you wear.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.873
Oh, my God.
Sounds crazy, right?

01:46.974 --> 01:48.642
Well, it works!
That's genius!

01:49.943 --> 01:51.111
That's the best.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.580
The HummViewer offers
a visually spectacular way

01:53.680 --> 01:55.515
to both feed
and observe hummingbirds

01:55.616 --> 01:57.184
right before your eyes.

01:58.485 --> 01:59.386
That is great!

01:59.486 --> 02:01.421
Oh, my goodness.
Man!

02:04.157 --> 02:05.525
The user is fully protected

02:05.626 --> 02:08.695
as the hummingbirds perform
a full-on acrobatic show

02:08.795 --> 02:12.499
as they swoop, dart, hover,
and even fly backward while feeding.

02:12.599 --> 02:15.802
Oh, my God.
That's so cool.
The vibrant red flowers
attached to the clear mask

02:15.902 --> 02:18.905
instantly attract
any hummingbirds nearby.

02:19.006 --> 02:21.975
So, Sharks, which one of you
want to experience the view,

02:22.075 --> 02:23.777
and <i>hum</i> along with us
on our journey

02:23.877 --> 02:25.245
to feed the birds?

02:25.345 --> 02:26.713
Wow.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.682
So what do you put in here?

02:28.782 --> 02:29.883
Is it like a sugar nectar?

02:29.983 --> 02:31.785
Yeah, the sugar water.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.354
And then how long do you have
to sit before they come?
That's so creative.

02:34.454 --> 02:37.357
John C.: We recommend,
until the birds get used to it,

02:37.457 --> 02:39.026
take down the bird feeder

02:39.126 --> 02:41.428
and stand or sit
where the feeder was.

02:41.528 --> 02:42.763
Gotcha.

02:44.631 --> 02:45.565
What do you sell these for,

02:45.666 --> 02:46.967
and what do they cost you
to make?

02:47.067 --> 02:50.637
We sell them for $59.95,
and they cost $10 to make.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.973
How many have you sold?

02:53.073 --> 02:54.775
Oh, we've sold about 500.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.610
Whoa!
That's great.

02:56.710 --> 02:57.978
How did you come up
with this idea?

02:58.078 --> 03:00.714
This all started out
by me making one of these

03:00.814 --> 03:03.350
and taking it to our family's
cabin up in the mountains.

03:03.450 --> 03:06.920
My dear wife decided
that we needed to get on
Twitter and Facebook.

03:07.020 --> 03:11.158
So I tweeted a picture
of my brother wearing the mask.

03:11.258 --> 03:13.760
The TV-- The news company
in Denver,

03:13.860 --> 03:16.630
one of their photojournalists
called, and she said,

03:16.730 --> 03:18.832
"We want to do a story
on this mask."

03:20.067 --> 03:22.703
And I wondered
what the story was, you know?

03:22.803 --> 03:24.938
Is the story
crazy man in the mountain?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.540
No.
Crazy man
in the mountains.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.874
So, maybe that's it.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.377
So, 15 minutes
after they aired it,

03:30.477 --> 03:32.979
I got an e-mail from
a gentleman who said--

03:33.080 --> 03:36.183
All it said was,
"Put me down for a dozen."

03:37.651 --> 03:39.853
I looked at her and was like,
"We might be on to something."

03:41.254 --> 03:42.589
Do you have a patent?

03:42.689 --> 03:44.825
The people that own the
property above our cabin,

03:44.925 --> 03:47.160
he's a retired patent agent.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.963
His recommendation was
to get a patent application.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.331
And then we decided,

03:51.431 --> 03:54.201
"We can make a business
out of this, I think."

03:54.301 --> 03:56.970
Obviously there's a lot
of bird watchers, bird lovers,

03:57.070 --> 03:59.005
a hummingbird community,
I'm sure.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.141
So have you put out videos?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.376
Did you have anybody
within that community

04:03.477 --> 04:04.978
try to help you to sell these?

04:05.078 --> 04:05.979
We did.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.148
I reached out last fall

04:08.248 --> 04:11.318
to a hummingbird influencer
on TikTok.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.756
And he wore it
on his TikTok,

04:15.856 --> 04:17.357
and it's his fourth-most
highest viewed.

04:17.457 --> 04:20.527
He got 5.4 million views
on his video.

04:22.162 --> 04:24.464
Okay, guys,
one thing to know--

04:24.564 --> 04:26.433
I'm sure my fellow Sharks
do not know this,

04:26.533 --> 04:28.535
but I study Greek mythology.

04:28.635 --> 04:30.337
We know.
And in Greek mythology,

04:30.437 --> 04:32.672
the hummingbird
is known as a messenger.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.743
It brings messages
to humans...

04:36.843 --> 04:38.378
and it's given me one.

04:38.478 --> 04:39.179
I'm out.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.316
Well, thank you
for the message.
Thank you.

04:44.484 --> 04:45.519
So, guys,

04:45.619 --> 04:48.355
this is a really great
business/hobby

04:48.455 --> 04:50.624
where you can talk
to your community of people

04:50.724 --> 04:52.259
and have a great time
and experiences,

04:52.359 --> 04:53.493
make some money.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.195
I want you
to enjoy yourselves.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.264
I'm definitely going to use it
from time to time,

04:57.364 --> 04:59.099
but I'm out.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.636
You guys, this is not
something I would be
passionate about.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.571
I think it's awesome
you came up with the idea.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.740
You know, necessity is
the mother of invention,

05:06.840 --> 05:09.442
and you nailed it,
but it's not investable for me.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.211
So for those reasons, I'm out.

05:12.779 --> 05:15.649
Listen, guys, I think
it's super novel,

05:15.749 --> 05:17.050
super cute idea.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.020
I could totally see people
giving these to bird lovers,

05:20.120 --> 05:21.822
and just a lot of fun.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.224
But I do see it,
as my fellow Sharks do,

05:24.324 --> 05:26.626
as something that is a hobby,
a fun thing for you.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.428
I don't think it's something
that's going to make

05:28.528 --> 05:30.463
millions of dollars.
It doesn't need to.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.299
But as an investment for me,

05:32.399 --> 05:34.501
I don't see it
as an investable product,

05:34.601 --> 05:35.735
so I'm out.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.806
O'Leary: You have
one Shark left.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.945
First of all,
I am very interested,

05:45.045 --> 05:46.179
and I'll tell you why.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.883
When my dad passed away...

05:52.719 --> 05:57.524
...all of us saw a bird
outside of where he and my mom lived,

05:57.624 --> 05:58.792
and he loved hummingbirds.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.061
He always talked to us
about the hummingbird.

06:01.161 --> 06:05.432
And they're just extraordinary
engineering feats of nature.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.535
And every time
that we see hummingbirds,

06:08.635 --> 06:09.870
we call each other,

06:09.970 --> 06:12.439
my siblings and I and my mom,
thinking about my dad.

06:12.539 --> 06:17.043
So for me, this is <i>beshert.</i>
This is, like, fate.

06:17.143 --> 06:19.045
I actually think
it can go into novelty stores,

06:19.145 --> 06:20.647
it can do well on Amazon.

06:20.747 --> 06:23.016
I-I can see it being
a fun thing.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.050
Yes.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.552
Do you have any debt?

06:25.652 --> 06:29.422
Not company debt.
We took out a home equity loan

06:29.522 --> 06:31.591
in the beginning to help
pay for the patent

06:31.691 --> 06:34.461
and buy the minimum amount
of these that we could get.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.430
How much of your own money
has gone into this business?

06:37.530 --> 06:39.900
About $40,000.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.402
And what do you need
from a Shark?

06:42.502 --> 06:45.372
I've been in the electrical
business my whole life.

06:45.472 --> 06:49.342
I don't know much about the
retail and marketing industry.

06:49.442 --> 06:52.846
So what we need is
that somebody to help us

06:52.946 --> 06:56.816
set this business up
and market it.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.518
Do you have any inventory
currently?

06:58.618 --> 07:00.487
Yes. We have 1,500 left.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.089
Oh.
We bought 2,000
to begin with.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.759
Okay. Um...

07:05.859 --> 07:09.429
You have $25,000, lifetime,
of sales.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.731
I don't even know
how to value these, like...

07:11.831 --> 07:13.867
Well, that's been
a struggle for us, too,

07:13.967 --> 07:15.235
to tell you the truth.
You'd be a third partner.

07:15.335 --> 07:16.970
I--
So the three of you.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.204
33 and a 1/3 each.

07:18.305 --> 07:21.141
I mean, they did put $40,000
in. That's a lot of money.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.609
Yeah.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.144
I was going to say 50/50,

07:24.244 --> 07:27.580
but I will be, uh, channeling
my kindness of Lori,

07:27.681 --> 07:29.849
and I'll do 35%.

07:35.922 --> 07:38.224
That's a deal!
Let's do it!
Yeah!

07:38.325 --> 07:40.126
Come on!
Come see Daddy!

07:43.530 --> 07:45.966
Come to see Papa.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.000
That's great!

07:47.100 --> 07:48.168
Thank you so much.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.770
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
He's the best.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.238
Oh, my God.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.007
That was fantastic.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.442
Thanks, guys. Wonderful.

07:55.542 --> 07:56.776
Thank you.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.478
Congrats.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.981
We got it!

08:01.081 --> 08:02.415
Ahh!

08:02.515 --> 08:04.818
Just the one we wanted.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.753
That's salt-of-the-earth
people, man.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.288
I'm so--
I mean, that's--
Yeah.
Great people.

08:08.388 --> 08:09.356
That's why we do the show.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.424
You could have taken 90%
of his company,

08:11.524 --> 08:13.760
and he would have been,
"You got a deal!"

08:13.860 --> 08:15.295
We finally did it.
We did it.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.363
We knew we had a good idea.
We pulled it off!

08:16.463 --> 08:17.731
Yes.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.799
The crazy man
in the mountains did it.

08:19.899 --> 08:20.800
About that...

08:20.900 --> 08:22.669
Yeah!

08:35.181 --> 08:37.283
Next up
is a teen entrepreneur

08:37.384 --> 08:39.819
who started his business
while stuck at home

08:39.919 --> 08:42.022
during the pandemic lockdown.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.865
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Mark Lin

08:51.965 --> 08:53.466
from Burbank, California,

08:53.566 --> 08:56.469
and I'm here seeking $150,000

08:56.569 --> 09:00.673
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company, Sliimeyhoney.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.442
Sharks, ever since
I was little,

09:02.542 --> 09:06.479
my parents always told me,
"Never play with your food."

09:06.579 --> 09:08.982
But food is so much fun
to play with.

09:09.082 --> 09:12.352
I couldn't get enough of all
the different textures, the smells,

09:12.452 --> 09:14.788
and the way it squishes
between your fingers.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.523
I wanted a way
where everyone

09:16.623 --> 09:18.091
could enjoy
playing with their food.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.627
And that's why I created Sliimeyhoney,

09:20.727 --> 09:23.730
gourmet, next-level slime
that looks and smells

09:23.830 --> 09:25.398
like your favorite foods.

09:25.498 --> 09:26.766
We take real-life delicacies

09:26.866 --> 09:29.869
and turn them into playable,
stress-relieving slime.

09:29.969 --> 09:33.206
And the best part-- They're
zero calories, Mr. Wonderful,

09:33.306 --> 09:35.141
because you can't eat it.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.744
Growing up with Asian culture,
one of my favorite snacks

09:37.844 --> 09:40.180
was always banana milk
from Korean markets,

09:40.280 --> 09:42.482
so I turned that into
our best-selling glossy slime,

09:42.582 --> 09:45.151
Banana Milk,
scented exactly like bananas.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.720
Banana Milk is so much fun
to poke, stretch, and squeeze,

09:47.821 --> 09:49.422
and it comes with
the cutest banana charm

09:49.522 --> 09:51.558
and some banana sprinkles,
as well.

09:51.658 --> 09:54.127
With over 100 different slimes
to choose from,

09:54.227 --> 09:56.096
from beginning level
to advanced,

09:56.196 --> 09:58.932
Sliimeyhoney has
the perfect anxiety-relieving,

09:59.032 --> 10:01.267
fun texture for everyone.

10:01.367 --> 10:04.137
There's a reason our new
slime drops sell out every week.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.839
I may only be 17,

10:05.939 --> 10:08.842
but I already know I was made
to be an entrepreneur,

10:08.942 --> 10:11.711
and I don't want to do
anything else with my life.

10:11.811 --> 10:15.048
So, which one of you
is ready to take basic,

10:15.148 --> 10:19.652
boring slime to the next level
with Sliimeyhoney?

10:19.752 --> 10:21.421
Great job, Mark.
All right.
Great job.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.523
I can't wait to smell it,
because you made it sound
like it's amazing.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.492
Oh, yeah,
they smell amazing.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.760
I prepared--
Just to clarify this, Mark,
we cannot eat this, right?

10:27.861 --> 10:29.295
You cannot eat it, unfortunately.

10:29.395 --> 10:30.563
What happens
if you <i>do</i> eat it?

10:30.663 --> 10:33.133
If you do eat it,
you won't die, and--

10:33.233 --> 10:34.501
How do you know
you won't die?

10:34.601 --> 10:36.669
And, also, the second that
you put it in your mouth,

10:36.769 --> 10:38.204
you know that you won't
want to eat it anymore

10:38.304 --> 10:39.739
because it does not
taste good.

10:39.839 --> 10:43.042
Now, is this cookie supposed
to get mixed up into it,

10:43.143 --> 10:46.379
or do I take it off?
Uh, yes, you're supposed to
mix the clay into the slime.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.447
This smells great.

10:47.547 --> 10:48.915
It's a waffle.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.517
How many different slimes
do you have?

10:50.617 --> 10:53.453
There's over 100 different
slimes in my online store.

10:53.553 --> 10:54.821
Where are you making
the slime?

10:54.921 --> 10:56.456
I'm currently
producing everything

10:56.556 --> 10:57.957
out of my house's garage.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.593
My mom does a lot to help me.

11:00.693 --> 11:04.063
She's spent all-nighters with
me packing orders.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.499
I actually hired many
of my high school friends.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.168
There's about 11
in rotation.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.671
They come Monday through
Friday, and they help me
package orders,

11:11.771 --> 11:13.373
package the slime--
They come to your house?

11:13.473 --> 11:14.307
Yeah, they come to my house.
And you pay them?
That's awesome.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.608
That is awesome.
Yes, I pay them.

11:15.708 --> 11:16.676
Yeah.
Yeah, that's awesome.

11:16.776 --> 11:18.411
What's this little
eyedropper thing?

11:18.511 --> 11:19.946
Oh, that, um...
That makes it less sticky.

11:20.046 --> 11:20.980
Makes it less sticky.
That's the activator,

11:21.080 --> 11:23.149
which, if you are having
a problem with

11:23.249 --> 11:24.951
the stickiness of the slime,
you just add it in...
It really makes a big
difference, yeah.

11:25.084 --> 11:27.453
It does.
...and mix it in, and
it should become less sticky.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.322
So, what do you sell
these for, Mark?

11:29.422 --> 11:31.958
So, depending on the slime... Kevin.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.627
...it goes from
anywhere between $10 to $16

11:34.727 --> 11:35.862
on my website,
plus shipping.

11:35.962 --> 11:36.963
And what's your cost
to make it?

11:37.063 --> 11:38.865
So, I produce it myself
in my garage.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.968
It could cost about
$2 to $4 to make,

11:42.068 --> 11:43.436
and then I sell it
for $10 to $16.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.105
Alright, so why don't you
tell us a little bit about you.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.309
So I just graduated
high school. Congratulations.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.811
Congrats.
And I'm currently--
O'Leary: Are you planning
to go to college?

11:51.911 --> 11:53.746
Yes, I am planning
on going to college.

11:53.846 --> 11:55.582
I'm going to UCLA in the fall.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.717
Congrats.
Alright.
Thank you.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.086
And I don't think
that me going to college

12:00.186 --> 12:02.488
will produce negative benefits
on the business

12:02.589 --> 12:03.890
because once I move
into a warehouse,

12:03.990 --> 12:06.059
I'll be able to run
my business successfully.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.028
And I think that
my high school experience

12:09.128 --> 12:12.365
proves that I will be able
to sustain my business

12:12.465 --> 12:14.667
and even continue
to grow it--

12:14.767 --> 12:16.669
What is happening
to Kevin over there?

12:16.769 --> 12:18.605
I mean, there's something
really going wrong.
Mark, can you help me?
I'm-- I'm slimed.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.173
Yeah.
Like, what do I do?

12:20.273 --> 12:22.308
You gotta pour some of
that stuff on there.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.444
I think he poured
the whole bottle.
O'Leary: I can't open it.
Open that up for me, will ya?

12:24.544 --> 12:26.246
Okay.

12:26.346 --> 12:30.250
Having trouble here.
I know. You really are.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.085
And how do you sell it?

12:32.185 --> 12:34.354
The way I market is
I post TikTok videos,

12:34.454 --> 12:35.355
and I currently--
today,

12:35.455 --> 12:37.724
I have 900,000 followers
on TikTok.

12:37.824 --> 12:40.893
Our current business model
was we keep as many slimes

12:40.994 --> 12:43.029
from previous drops
as possible in stock.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.164
And every single week,
I try to come up with

12:45.265 --> 12:47.233
anywhere between two to five
brand-new slimes

12:47.333 --> 12:48.401
to launch to the shop.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.770
So every Saturday,
at 11:00 a. m. Pacific,

12:50.870 --> 12:52.205
I go on my website and I drop

12:52.305 --> 12:53.740
the two to five
brand-new flavors,

12:53.840 --> 12:56.075
and those are typically
the best hits of the week.

12:56.175 --> 12:58.077
And what's your
typical shipping?

12:58.177 --> 13:00.980
Shipping, on average for
one slime, is about $5 to $6.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.783
Ooh.
Okay, so about 20 bucks
all in, typically?
Yes.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.685
What's your total
dollar amount sold?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.121
Okay, so our lifetime sales
is $1.2 million.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.822
Oh!
Whoa!
Good for you, Mark.

13:09.922 --> 13:11.858
You said you're 17?
Yes.
And you must have made
a boatload of money,

13:11.958 --> 13:12.925
because you're gonna
tell us that...
O'Leary: Are you kidding?

13:13.026 --> 13:14.093
...your margins
are huge, right?

13:14.193 --> 13:15.928
Correct.
My margins <i>are</i> huge.

13:16.029 --> 13:19.132
Tell us.
We make about 70% margins.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.300
Wow.
So, two questions.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.968
One, how much have you made
in profits?

13:22.068 --> 13:24.137
And two,
how do you track all of it?

13:24.237 --> 13:27.240
So, in 2020,
we did $50,000 in sales,

13:27.340 --> 13:30.176
and we did $13,000
in profit from that.

13:30.276 --> 13:34.147
In 2021, we did
$580,000 in sales,

13:34.247 --> 13:36.983
and $300,000 profit
from that. Wow.

13:37.083 --> 13:40.253
And, to date, we've done
$540,000 in sales,

13:40.353 --> 13:42.455
and another
$300,000 in profit.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.590
Amazing.
$300,000 over $540,000?
Yeah.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.292
So how do you know
that's right?

13:46.392 --> 13:48.628
My mom is a certified accountant,

13:48.728 --> 13:50.463
and she does
all my books for me.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.432
Good for you.
There you go, then.
That makes it all even better.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.733
Good for Mom. Yeah.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.369
That's amazing, because
literally in high school,

13:56.469 --> 13:57.770
you created a business

13:57.870 --> 14:01.441
that now will pay for all
of your college and then some.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.009
I'm proud of your acumen.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.210
I think you're going
to go very far.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.878
I think this is
just your beginning.

14:05.978 --> 14:08.281
But the slimy-slime space
is not my space,

14:08.381 --> 14:09.716
so for those reasons,
I'm out.

14:09.816 --> 14:12.852
But I wish you just
the very, very best.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.020
O'Leary: I mean,
I'm looking at you, saying,

14:14.120 --> 14:15.988
"Okay,
you're very credible."

14:16.089 --> 14:18.925
I mean, the product
is completely nuts.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.760
But the market decides, right?

14:20.860 --> 14:24.597
Would you be willing to give
my own flavor, Wonder Slime?

14:24.697 --> 14:26.966
Of course we can make you
a Wonder Slime, Mr. Wonderful.

14:27.066 --> 14:30.470
Yeah. I mean, I'm interested
because you're a good operator,

14:30.570 --> 14:31.904
but I have to have
some mechanism

14:32.004 --> 14:34.741
by which I get my capital
back. Otherwise, I'm crazy.

14:34.841 --> 14:37.877
Um, $150,000.
I want 30%.

14:37.977 --> 14:41.047
And we're basically--
You're 2/3, I'm 1/3.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.483
And we do distributions accordingly.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.786
Well, while you're thinking
about Kevin's offer,

14:46.886 --> 14:49.555
I think that this slime
is very cute.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.290
I really like that you
created something

14:51.391 --> 14:53.726
innovative and different
in the slime world.

14:53.826 --> 14:57.897
But I don't think that I want
to be in the slime business.

14:57.997 --> 15:01.134
I'm all in on you, but you're
doing well enough on your own,

15:01.234 --> 15:03.136
so I wish you good luck,

15:03.236 --> 15:05.171
but I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.

15:05.271 --> 15:06.439
Yeah, Mark, congratulations.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.041
What you've done is
insanely amazing.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.510
I'm jealous.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.579
But at the same time, I think
it's a great business for you,

15:13.679 --> 15:16.149
but I think it's a mistake
to even take investment,

15:16.249 --> 15:17.550
so for those reasons,
I'm out.

15:19.585 --> 15:23.523
Here's where I stand,
and I'll probably help you
with your decision on Kevin.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.425
I agree with Mark that
you don't necessarily need

15:25.525 --> 15:26.592
an investor
at this moment,

15:26.692 --> 15:28.861
and, you know,
you need to go to school.

15:28.961 --> 15:29.896
Education is key.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.431
That's something
that you have a chance

15:31.531 --> 15:32.899
to really accomplish.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.700
You've done
a great job here.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.303
Um, and for that reason...

15:39.405 --> 15:41.874
...I'm in at $150,000
and 25%.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.689
Three Sharks are out,

15:56.789 --> 15:58.691
and Mark has two offers
on the table

15:58.791 --> 16:02.094
for his homemade slime
company, Sliimeyhoney.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.362
Thank you so much
for your offer--

16:03.463 --> 16:05.565
both of you, actually.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.533
So, where I'm at right now is,

16:07.633 --> 16:10.837
I think that my sales have
proven the value of my company.

16:10.937 --> 16:15.041
And so, would either of you
be interested in

16:15.141 --> 16:17.543
maybe raising the dollar
amount for more equity?

16:17.643 --> 16:19.846
Why do you need more money?

16:19.946 --> 16:22.081
Um, I think that
I need more money

16:22.181 --> 16:25.985
to just be compensated
for the percentage

16:26.085 --> 16:27.320
that I'm giving away.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.389
Then I need about $10 million
to be compensated for my time.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.925
Mark, you want to counter
either of their offers?

16:33.025 --> 16:35.728
Yes, I would. Um...

16:37.029 --> 16:39.198
So, would either of you got--

16:39.298 --> 16:45.838
be willing to do
$300,000 for 25%?

16:45.938 --> 16:48.641
You're basically saying
you wanted $150,000 for
12.5%... No.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.276
...at the end of the day.
That's what you're saying.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.211
You're saying the same thing.

16:52.311 --> 16:53.379
O'Leary: I would not do
that deal with you, Mark.

16:53.479 --> 16:54.647
I would not do that deal.
Daymond might.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.382
I would not do that deal. Okay.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.351
I mean, I want to be
in the premium slime business,

16:58.451 --> 17:00.052
because everything about
Mr. Wonderful is premium.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.221
And so that fits
with the branding.
And slimy.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.623
And I want to do
Wonder Slime.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.790
I think that would be
a lot of fun.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.626
I think a lot of
my millions of followers

17:06.726 --> 17:08.094
would want to buy
some of that.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.462
But that's not free.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.163
There's value there,
tremendous value. Right.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.798
You're not willing
to give me any.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.700
That's the frustration.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.702
And that's my challenge,
as well, right, because--
Stick to
your guns, Mark.

17:16.802 --> 17:18.371
I look at it and say,
you must have had flexibility

17:18.471 --> 17:19.639
when you walked in here.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.107
You knew you weren't going
to get a deal at 10%.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.709
That's not "Shark Tank."
Right.

17:23.809 --> 17:29.482
Would you guys be willing
to do $200,000 for 20%?

17:29.582 --> 17:32.518
I'm at $150,000 because
you came in at $150,000.

17:32.618 --> 17:37.023
You keep asking for cash
when you have cash, right?
Right.

17:37.123 --> 17:39.659
I'm at $150,000. We can play
with the percentages...

17:39.759 --> 17:41.127
Okay.
...but I'm not going
to go over that,

17:41.227 --> 17:42.428
because that's what
you came in for.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.697
And you're good on cash
at the moment. Right.

17:44.797 --> 17:48.467
Because all the things we're
adding is not going to be cash

17:48.568 --> 17:50.503
when you have my team
and all this and marketing. Right.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.971
O'Leary: Mark,
I think I have a solution.
Counter with
a lower equity.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.372
I think I have a solution. Okay.

17:53.472 --> 17:56.676
You come up with the most
equity you're willing to give
right now

17:56.776 --> 17:57.944
in your moment
on "Shark Tank,"

17:58.044 --> 17:59.545
we decide yes or no.

17:59.645 --> 18:02.081
Each of us can make
that decision. Yeah.

18:02.181 --> 18:04.450
You have to come up at--
for $150,000.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.452
It's not 10%. It's gotta be
higher, obviously.

18:06.552 --> 18:08.120
Right.
What is it?

18:08.220 --> 18:11.257
Would you guys be willing
to do $150,000 for 20%?

18:12.592 --> 18:15.294
I'll do that deal.
I'll do it for 20%, as well.

18:15.394 --> 18:17.597
Now it just depends
on which Shark you want.

18:17.697 --> 18:20.132
Okay.

18:20.232 --> 18:23.302
Which one do you think
would be a better mentor?

18:24.537 --> 18:26.806
Mr. Kevin O'Leary?
No. Which one could
sell more slime

18:26.906 --> 18:28.174
is what you should
be asking.
Or the one with the child?

18:28.274 --> 18:29.809
He wanted a mentor.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.345
Um...

18:33.379 --> 18:35.281
I've already got my hands
dirty with your business.

18:35.381 --> 18:37.183
That's true.
Super dirty.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.951
Because he didn't know how
to play with slime.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.219
That's true, too.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.222
What are you
going to do, Mark?

18:48.995 --> 18:51.030
Um...

18:51.130 --> 18:52.732
Sorry, guys. This is a lot of-- Greiner: No, it's alright.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.900
Why don't you turn around
so you can think for a minute

18:54.900 --> 18:56.569
without staring at us?
Do you need some slime
to reduce the anxiety?

18:56.669 --> 18:57.970
I'll use the slime.
Yeah, yeah.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.839
We don't want
to stress you out.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.540
It's an important decision.

19:02.541 --> 19:03.909
Mm.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.451
Daymond, I will take
your offer.
Yay!

19:12.551 --> 19:14.286
Whoa!

19:14.387 --> 19:15.354
Good deal!
You got a partner,

19:15.454 --> 19:18.524
and we defeated evil,
all at the same time.

19:18.624 --> 19:20.092
I'm sorry, Mr. Wonderful.

19:20.192 --> 19:21.093
O'Leary: That's alright.

19:21.193 --> 19:23.062
Don't be sorry.
Congrats, Mark.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.032
Thank you so much.
Congratulations, man.

19:26.132 --> 19:27.266
Congrats, Mark.
We'll be great partners.

19:27.366 --> 19:28.567
Yes.
I believe in you.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.770
And we're going to make sure
you go to school. Yes.

19:30.870 --> 19:31.871
And I'm gonna help you
with this business, alright?
Okay.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.406
Tell Mom and Dad I said,
"What's up?"

19:33.506 --> 19:34.707
Okay.
Alright.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.108
Thank you. Congratulations.

19:36.208 --> 19:38.110
Congrats.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.479
I'm so glad that
I was able to get a deal

19:40.579 --> 19:42.415
and gain the mentorship
of a Shark,

19:42.515 --> 19:44.784
which is really
what I came in here looking for.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.553
I just felt a spark with
Daymond over Mr. Wonderful,

19:47.653 --> 19:49.822
who was having a really
hard time playing with it,

19:49.922 --> 19:52.825
and I think that it was just
a better partnership overall.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.629
In Season 10,
we watched Anna Skaya

19:56.729 --> 19:57.997
make a deal with Kevin O'Leary

19:58.097 --> 20:00.633
for her cat DNA test company, Basepaws.

20:00.733 --> 20:01.934
- Let's do it.
- Alright.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.403
Let's see what
she's up to now.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.005
When I first pitched
on "Shark Tank,"

20:06.105 --> 20:07.440
we had a four-person team,

20:07.540 --> 20:09.775
and we just hit
$200,000 in revenue.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.145
Since closing a deal with
Kevin, we have over 30 employees,

20:13.245 --> 20:16.382
and last year,
we hit $3.5 million in revenue.

20:16.482 --> 20:18.451
Today, I'm in Parsippany,
New Jersey,

20:18.551 --> 20:20.820
to meet with the CEO
of the world's leading

20:20.920 --> 20:22.254
animal-health company.

20:22.354 --> 20:25.157
When we think about taking
the genetics of Basepaws

20:25.257 --> 20:27.927
and we combine it with
Zoetis' ability to predict,

20:28.027 --> 20:29.428
prevent, detect, and treat,

20:29.528 --> 20:32.131
together, we're gonna
create a new world

20:32.231 --> 20:33.432
for precision animal health.

20:33.532 --> 20:35.668
Zoetis creates some of
the world's best

20:35.768 --> 20:36.936
medication for pets,

20:37.036 --> 20:38.537
and we believe
that our database

20:38.637 --> 20:40.306
holds an enormous amount
of value

20:40.406 --> 20:43.242
to the development
of vaccines and medication.

20:43.342 --> 20:46.078
The Basepaws vision
resonated so well

20:46.178 --> 20:48.214
that company
made an offer to acquire us,

20:48.314 --> 20:51.917
and that offer was for
more than $50 million.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.652
<i>Basepaws started
on "Shark Tank,"</i>

20:53.753 --> 20:54.854
<i>grew with "Shark Tank,"</i>

20:54.954 --> 20:57.256
and we are so proud to be
part of this outcome.

20:57.356 --> 20:59.759
Basepaws is such a success
story for "Shark Tank"

20:59.859 --> 21:01.560
'cause it proves,
if you work hard,

21:01.660 --> 21:03.229
the outcomes are extraordinary.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.998
Anna's a wealthy woman today
because she delivered.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.333
It only took her three years.

21:07.433 --> 21:11.637
Remember, this acquisition is
over $50 million cash.

21:11.737 --> 21:12.738
That's what I like.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.607
Did I say that right?
Cash.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.209
I will continue to run
day-to-day operations

21:17.309 --> 21:20.346
at Basepaws
with a focus on new test kits

21:20.446 --> 21:23.949
to understand not just our
cats, but also our dogs.

21:24.049 --> 21:26.452
The launch of our dog kits
expands our reach

21:26.552 --> 21:29.889
to 69 million new households
in America.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.457
Today is a huge milestone,

21:31.557 --> 21:33.459
not just for you
at Basepaws,

21:33.559 --> 21:35.461
but for us here
at Zoetis, as well.

21:35.561 --> 21:38.397
We've gone from
a very small company

21:38.497 --> 21:41.534
to now being part of
a $8 billion organization,

21:41.634 --> 21:44.837
creating products
that will change the world.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.939
It's a very humbling
place to be.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.842
We are now entering a much,
much bigger phase

21:49.942 --> 21:53.479
where our tests
will create value forever.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.691
Next up
is an innovative solution

22:05.791 --> 22:08.027
to fight a growing problem.

22:18.537 --> 22:20.639
Hello, Sharks.
My name is Bianca Wittenberg.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.408
I am from El Dorado Hills, California,

22:22.508 --> 22:25.177
and I am the co-founder
of FireFighter1.

22:25.277 --> 22:31.217
Today I am seeking $150,000
for 15% equity of my company.

22:31.317 --> 22:34.386
How many of you know somebody
who's lost property due to fire,

22:34.486 --> 22:37.923
been evacuated,
or had a fire scare
themselves?

22:38.023 --> 22:41.827
Increasing temperatures and
drought are limiting resources,

22:41.927 --> 22:43.262
and devastating wildfires

22:43.362 --> 22:46.232
are taking over many parts
of our country.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.968
As a homeowner,
you don't have many options.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.303
If there's a fire,
you could evacuate

22:51.403 --> 22:52.872
and hope
that the fire department

22:52.972 --> 22:55.941
has enough resources
to help protect your property,

22:56.041 --> 22:58.744
or you could grab a garden
hose and spray your roof

22:58.844 --> 23:01.213
and perimeter,
hoping for the best.

23:01.313 --> 23:03.315
That's what my dad
would see people doing

23:03.415 --> 23:07.553
while watching news coverage
of the wildfires every single year.

23:07.653 --> 23:10.289
He knew there had
to be a better way.

23:10.389 --> 23:13.392
So many of those homes,
just like ours, had pools.

23:13.492 --> 23:17.263
It got him thinking, what
about fast access to pool
water?

23:17.363 --> 23:19.365
And FireFighter1 was born.

23:19.465 --> 23:22.101
FireFighter1 is the first
affordable resource

23:22.201 --> 23:24.536
designed for pool owners
to quickly access

23:24.637 --> 23:28.073
the average 25,000 gallons
of pool water in seconds.

23:28.173 --> 23:29.808
If there ever is a fire,

23:29.909 --> 23:31.443
you grab your
FireFighter1 hose

23:31.543 --> 23:33.445
from its stored location,

23:33.545 --> 23:39.251
connect our adapter to
your pool pump, just like that,

23:39.351 --> 23:41.887
grab the nozzle,

23:41.987 --> 23:43.155
be ready,

23:43.255 --> 23:45.190
turn the pump on, aim,

23:45.291 --> 23:48.761
and in less than 30 seconds,
spray valuable pool water

23:48.861 --> 23:52.765
a distance of 40 feet at a
rate of 80 gallons per minute.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.668
That's pretty cool.
This is a 35-foot roof line.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.638
In about 7 minutes, you could
drench the entire property. Wow.

23:59.738 --> 24:03.309
So, Sharks, together we can
keep properties safer from fire,

24:03.409 --> 24:06.211
and I can continue building
the FireFighter1 legacy

24:06.312 --> 24:08.480
for my dad.
That's very cool.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.015
What happens
if you've been--

24:10.115 --> 24:11.650
if you've been instructed
to evacuate?

24:11.750 --> 24:14.119
If you've been instructed to
evacuate, you evacuate.

24:14.219 --> 24:17.323
But a lot of times, a fire is
a couple miles in the distance,

24:17.423 --> 24:20.826
and embers fly over a mile,
so the fires jump.

24:20.926 --> 24:23.996
You could wet the property
well before you're evacuated.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.799
Or in other instances,
you know, a backyard barbecue,

24:26.899 --> 24:28.734
something happens,
and you want to put that out

24:28.834 --> 24:30.269
before a fire spreads.

24:30.369 --> 24:31.603
Are you just
selling the hose?

24:31.704 --> 24:34.406
So, I'm selling the hose
with the adapter.

24:34.506 --> 24:36.108
You already have the pump.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.210
That pump is a standard pump
in every pool?

24:38.310 --> 24:39.979
So, this is standard.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.847
Our adapter is not standard.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.916
So what you do is you have
your pool person

24:44.016 --> 24:45.651
install the three-way valve.

24:45.751 --> 24:46.952
It takes
only about 15 minutes.

24:47.052 --> 24:48.187
So it takes some proactive.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.122
You're gonna have to get
your pool guy or pool girl...

24:50.222 --> 24:51.790
Yes. Yes.
...or whatever.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.692
Yeah, but then you
leave it that way?
And then you just leave it.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.961
It's a one-time thing.
And many people already
have these installed

24:56.061 --> 24:58.297
with an open port
just for an out spout.

24:58.397 --> 25:00.199
So when you have those,
which ends up being about

25:00.299 --> 25:01.967
25% of my customers,

25:01.967 --> 25:04.336
you just add our adapter
onto that three-way valve,

25:04.436 --> 25:05.337
and you're good to go.

25:05.437 --> 25:06.572
What do you sell it for,

25:06.672 --> 25:08.407
and what does
it cost you to make?

25:08.507 --> 25:11.777
This 50-foot unit,
I sell for $499.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.246
It costs me about
$124 to build it.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.481
Wow.
And that's right now.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.850
I'm only building about
25 to 30 units at a time,

25:17.950 --> 25:20.419
so I could definitely
increase my margins.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.388
The 100-foot sells for $399,

25:22.488 --> 25:24.790
and it costs me
about $200 to make.

25:24.890 --> 25:26.325
Educate me.

25:26.425 --> 25:29.561
So, I was assuming, when
these fires come through, that,

25:29.661 --> 25:31.096
I mean, it's just timber

25:31.196 --> 25:33.365
and a lot of things falling
right onto the property.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.667
That is something that
a drenched property--

25:35.768 --> 25:37.703
it would not solve that.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.438
But you're saying
it's really the embers?

25:39.538 --> 25:41.874
So, that's a huge problem.
It's the flying embers.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.976
Because the embers fly
more than a mile.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.411
They hit another roof line,

25:45.511 --> 25:47.613
they hit some
dry patch of trees,

25:47.713 --> 25:51.316
they hit a bunch of trash,
anything catches.
Got it.

25:51.417 --> 25:52.951
And then it spreads again.
And these embers
are just, like...

25:53.052 --> 25:55.154
So that's a huge problem.
...they're large pieces of--

25:55.254 --> 25:57.489
Yep, just pieces of debris
that are kind of flying,

25:57.589 --> 26:00.592
and they'll pick up air and
then they fly to a new place.
The windier,
the worse it is.

26:00.692 --> 26:03.295
I'm curious.
You talked about your father,

26:03.395 --> 26:04.930
that this is his invention.
Yes. Yeah.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.332
So I would love to hear
about you,

26:07.433 --> 26:09.034
your background,
and your father.

26:09.134 --> 26:12.137
This was his idea. Like I
said, we're in Southern California,

26:12.237 --> 26:13.906
and we, every single year,

26:14.006 --> 26:15.674
would have different fires occurring.

26:15.774 --> 26:17.576
And one day, he looked
at the pool and he said,

26:17.676 --> 26:19.411
"Why don't we have access?"

26:19.511 --> 26:21.713
Obviously, a lot of us
have pools.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.449
So he started
looking into it,

26:23.549 --> 26:24.583
and there are some big pumps

26:24.683 --> 26:26.452
where you could buy
a separate engine

26:26.552 --> 26:28.120
and drop it into the pool,

26:28.220 --> 26:30.556
but they're expensive
and many people can't afford

26:30.656 --> 26:32.724
to spend thousands of dollars
on something.

26:32.825 --> 26:36.228
So he came up with
FireFighter1 when we were kids.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.897
He passed a little bit
over five years ago,

26:38.997 --> 26:40.833
so I started redeveloping it.

26:40.933 --> 26:44.470
So, can the firemen
use your product in some way

26:44.570 --> 26:46.605
to help them
to fight the fires... Yes.

26:46.705 --> 26:48.474
...by draining pools
if they needed to?

26:48.574 --> 26:49.308
Absolutely.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.309
So, the goal in the long term

26:50.409 --> 26:51.877
is that fire departments
would know

26:51.977 --> 26:53.879
where every single one
of these is,

26:53.979 --> 26:55.247
and they could use it.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.616
And I'm really surprised
Kevin O'Leary didn't
ask you this.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.985
Let's hear it.
What are your sales?

27:00.085 --> 27:03.155
We just launched
this February 2022.

27:03.255 --> 27:06.358
My cash flow is
$22,000 in sales.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.593
And how many units
is that?

27:07.693 --> 27:09.328
I've sold 49 units, actually.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.063
Okay.
Yeah, just under 50 units.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.197
You're just starting.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.466
The sales are
generally small,

27:14.566 --> 27:16.034
but that doesn't
mean anything, right?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.603
Well,
it means they're small.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.173
Where did
the sales come from?

27:21.273 --> 27:23.108
I've been partnering with
pool companies

27:23.208 --> 27:25.944
because they already have the
relationship with pool owners.

27:26.044 --> 27:27.646
And are you paying them
a commission?

27:27.746 --> 27:30.082
Exactly. So I pay them--
How much do you pay them?

27:30.182 --> 27:33.752
So, if they just sell the
units themselves on a
commission base,

27:33.852 --> 27:35.087
they get 20%.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.456
If I have a pool store
who's buying inventory,

27:37.556 --> 27:40.125
it's 25% to 30%
off wholesale,

27:40.225 --> 27:42.294
depending on
how many units they buy.

27:42.394 --> 27:45.430
I love the space of
helping people stay safe.

27:45.531 --> 27:47.166
It means a lot to me.

27:47.266 --> 27:50.435
But, um, I feel that
this is not a place

27:50.536 --> 27:52.371
where I could
add enormous value.

27:52.471 --> 27:57.342
So, regretfully, I'm out.
But I wish you the very best.

27:57.442 --> 28:00.712
Look, Bianca, um, not
every business is investable.

28:00.812 --> 28:03.615
Because you're so nascent,
you're so early.

28:03.715 --> 28:05.817
You're so just figuring out
how to sell it.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.953
It has merit,
but I just...

28:08.053 --> 28:10.255
My feeling is I could make
hundreds of dollars.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.924
You could make millions
of dollars.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.625
I don't know that.
And so could I.

28:13.725 --> 28:15.260
You have to go prove that.
And so could a couple of
Sharks if they want in.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.696
So, for that reason,
I'm out.

28:17.796 --> 28:20.032
I think you're on
the right path to success

28:20.132 --> 28:21.667
by figuring it out small.

28:21.767 --> 28:23.035
I don't know anything
about this.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.403
You see,
you are educating me. Yeah.

28:24.503 --> 28:25.904
I don't think
I could add value.

28:26.004 --> 28:27.072
I think a lot
of people need this,

28:27.172 --> 28:28.040
but I wouldn't be able
to help you.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.408
So I'm out.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.443
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
Bianca, listen.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.012
In my opinion, I feel like
this is the type of product

28:34.112 --> 28:36.415
that needs a lot
of mouthpieces behind it...

28:36.515 --> 28:38.317
And that's why I need--
...and promotion,

28:38.417 --> 28:40.452
and I think this is
one of these things that,

28:40.552 --> 28:42.454
Mark, if you're willing
to go in with me, Okay.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.623
I think that we'll just
help figure it out.
But I--
Let me just ask--

28:44.723 --> 28:46.658
Let me ask a question.
Are you patient?
Yeah, absolutely.

28:46.758 --> 28:49.228
I'm very patient
and I'm very hard working, yes.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.230
This is a patience
business, right?
I know.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.564
To Lori's point,

28:52.664 --> 28:54.533
some of
the greatest changes,

28:54.633 --> 28:57.102
you know, entrepreneurial
changes, took time.

28:57.202 --> 28:58.470
Absolutely.
Right?

28:58.570 --> 29:00.606
It's going to take time
for people to understand this.

29:00.706 --> 29:03.008
It's going to take time
for word to get out. Right.

29:03.108 --> 29:04.409
But the good thing
about this business--

29:04.509 --> 29:06.578
there's a lot
of great leverage points.

29:06.678 --> 29:09.381
Yes.
Because all the pool servicers

29:09.481 --> 29:11.183
all throughout California,

29:11.283 --> 29:12.618
the minute
there's a wildfire

29:12.718 --> 29:14.853
and someone's, you know,
home is threatened,

29:14.953 --> 29:16.788
all of a sudden,
they understand it. Right.

29:16.888 --> 29:21.893
So, Mark, she's asking for
$150,000 for 15%.

29:21.994 --> 29:25.897
So, I mean, we're gonna have
to do quite a bit of work

29:25.998 --> 29:28.467
to help you here.
It'll be a slow burn, literally.

29:28.567 --> 29:29.601
You're gonna need
a lot of us, so...

29:29.701 --> 29:31.136
I understand that.

29:31.236 --> 29:33.939
So, $150,000 for 25%.

29:34.039 --> 29:36.108
For 25%? For both of you?

29:36.208 --> 29:37.242
The two of us.
For both of you.

29:37.342 --> 29:38.377
Don't let
that hose get away.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.512
Don't let that hose get away.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.648
Would you guys do it
for 20% for both of you?

29:42.748 --> 29:43.749
Nope.

29:46.351 --> 29:48.420
No.
Ha! I could tell
by your faces.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.821
You have a deal.

29:49.921 --> 29:51.523
We have a deal, yes.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.624
No, we have a deal.

29:52.724 --> 29:55.527
I need to do it,
for sure.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.430
We need to help this world.
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so excited.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.032
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.633
Thank you, guys.
No, it's good.

30:01.733 --> 30:02.401
Congratulations.
Bye, guys.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.502
Congrats. Congrats.

30:05.003 --> 30:06.505
Oh,
I need to start working

30:06.605 --> 30:08.640
to start getting
FireFighter1 to people,

30:08.740 --> 30:10.742
and to start showing my dad

30:10.842 --> 30:12.911
that he did not disappoint,

30:13.011 --> 30:14.179
he didn't let us down,

30:14.279 --> 30:16.982
and that we're gonna
help people.

30:17.082 --> 30:17.983
Yeah.

30:30.295 --> 30:31.530
Next into the Tank

30:31.630 --> 30:34.199
is a way to make the most
out of your workouts.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.943
Hey, Sharks.
My name is Kalaii Griffin II.

30:45.043 --> 30:48.013
I am the CEO and founder
of ShredSkinz.

30:48.113 --> 30:52.317
Today, I'm seeking $60,000
for 20% equity of my company.

30:52.417 --> 30:54.353
Now, Sharks,
there are usually two ways

30:54.453 --> 30:58.190
to feel instant satisfaction
after a great workout.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.958
One, you push yourself
to the limit

31:00.058 --> 31:02.394
where you're so sore
the next morning,

31:02.494 --> 31:03.995
it just feels so good.

31:04.096 --> 31:07.599
And, two, being covered
head to toe in your own sweat.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.268
But with the current sauna
suits on the market today,

31:10.369 --> 31:12.304
if you don't clean
and dry them properly,

31:12.404 --> 31:14.773
you might irritate
your skin really bad.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.908
Mark, you've gotta know
what I'm talking about.

31:17.008 --> 31:18.877
I know exactly.
I sweat when I think about it.

31:18.977 --> 31:20.212
Right.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.748
I mean, the only other option
is using a trash bag.

31:22.848 --> 31:25.684
Who wants to use a trash bag?
Ew!

31:25.784 --> 31:28.987
Let's save that for the trash
and use ShredSkinz,

31:29.087 --> 31:30.722
the first and only

31:30.822 --> 31:32.657
single-use sauna suit
on the market today.

31:32.758 --> 31:35.127
At ShredSkinz,
we use an eco-friendly plastic

31:35.227 --> 31:38.330
to conveniently show you
your massive sweat progress.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.598
With our unique design,

31:39.698 --> 31:41.967
we have elastic
around the waist and the wrists,

31:41.967 --> 31:44.436
and on top of that,
a drawstring on the hood.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.572
This allows you to trap heat,
minimize your time warming up,

31:47.672 --> 31:50.609
and maximize your time
actually working out.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.477
And it just makes
you sweat faster.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.079
So I hope you make a deal
with me quickly.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.548
Let me show you what I mean.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.118
Ah!

32:00.218 --> 32:02.721
Oh, my.
That's all real sweat.

32:02.821 --> 32:05.357
Don't believe me?
Check this out.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.760
O'Leary: Ah.
Ew!

32:08.860 --> 32:10.829
Ah!

32:12.130 --> 32:13.532
O'Leary:
Singing my song.

32:13.632 --> 32:14.733
Wait, that's a joke, right?

32:14.833 --> 32:16.902
Not a joke.
That is all real sweat.

32:17.002 --> 32:19.805
But, see, that may be their
favorite part about ShredSkinz,

32:19.905 --> 32:22.107
but let me show you my
favorite part about ShredSkinz.

32:22.207 --> 32:24.075
Ahhh!

32:26.311 --> 32:27.679
Kevin, show him how
to really do it.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.382
Now, Sharks,
I know what you're thinking

32:30.482 --> 32:31.917
when you hear "single-use,"

32:32.050 --> 32:34.119
but we use an
oxo-degradable plastic,

32:34.219 --> 32:37.556
soon a newly-developed resin
to help break that plastic down

32:37.656 --> 32:38.824
even faster,

32:38.924 --> 32:41.993
as we strive to be
as eco-conscious as possible.

32:42.093 --> 32:44.996
This way you can feel just
as good about using ShredSkinz

32:45.096 --> 32:47.632
as you do wearing ShredSkinz
during a workout.

32:47.732 --> 32:51.770
So, Sharks, which one of you
wants to shed fast, easy sweat

32:51.870 --> 32:55.106
and shred fast, easy money
with ShredSkinz?

32:55.207 --> 32:56.675
You guys all have samples
in front of you.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.844
Check those out
while I put my shirt on. Alright.

32:58.944 --> 33:00.145
Great job. Yeah.

33:00.245 --> 33:01.580
You're lucky
Barbara's not here.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.949
Explain to me
the target market, okay?

33:04.049 --> 33:05.750
And is it just
to lose weight?

33:05.851 --> 33:08.286
The ironic part is ShredSkinz
actually does target women

33:08.386 --> 33:10.188
because women carry
a ton of water weight.

33:10.288 --> 33:13.959
But also, my biggest market
is athletes and fighters.

33:14.059 --> 33:17.229
Fighters need this, one,
to make weight all the time. Oh.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.830
This isn't something
that I created

33:18.930 --> 33:20.565
that didn't exist before.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.734
What didn't exist
is the convenience of it.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.370
So it allows you to, again,
minimize your warm-ups

33:25.470 --> 33:27.572
so you can heat up that
core temperature in your body

33:27.672 --> 33:29.007
and actually get
to your workouts.

33:29.107 --> 33:30.675
And then, some people
love the sweat.

33:30.775 --> 33:33.311
Some people love the idea
of looking at their sweat

33:33.411 --> 33:34.646
while they're working out.

33:34.746 --> 33:37.115
There's also if you need to be
ripped for whatever reason.

33:37.215 --> 33:39.751
I'm going to be a little bit
more doughy if I don't sweat,

33:39.851 --> 33:42.120
and I'm a lot more ripped
if I do sweat.

33:42.220 --> 33:43.922
Because that's what guys do.
So what you're saying is that
it's all water weight.

33:44.022 --> 33:47.425
Yes, exactly.
Like, so, if I need to
fit into something I can't,

33:47.526 --> 33:49.294
I'm a little fluffy...
Just-- Just to--

33:49.394 --> 33:51.863
...I can just put this on,
and it might fit me better?

33:51.963 --> 33:53.298
Maybe.
So just to be clear, right,

33:53.398 --> 33:54.933
I-I never promote this

33:55.033 --> 33:58.870
as a get skinny,
fit fast product ever. Right.

33:58.970 --> 34:01.406
The goal is to, yes,
give you that safety net

34:01.506 --> 34:03.642
where if you do need
to make a certain weight

34:03.742 --> 34:05.377
or you want to go on those
jogs and those runs

34:05.477 --> 34:07.245
'cause you know you have to
fit into your wedding dress,

34:07.345 --> 34:09.781
or you know you have to make
that weight cut for your fight,

34:09.881 --> 34:12.651
you know you have an option
to do so and it's convenient.

34:12.751 --> 34:15.854
I love the fact that you're
not overselling

34:15.954 --> 34:16.988
and that
you're underselling.

34:17.088 --> 34:18.623
That's a great gift
for an entrepreneur

34:18.723 --> 34:20.191
that has self-confidence.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.060
That you said
you're not trying

34:22.160 --> 34:24.029
to make silly
weight-loss claims. Right.

34:24.129 --> 34:25.430
I really love
what you said.

34:25.530 --> 34:27.032
O'Leary: Is there enough
of an established market

34:27.132 --> 34:28.567
that knows the merits of this,

34:28.667 --> 34:30.702
or do you have to educate
people to wear these?

34:30.802 --> 34:33.672
I believe that, in my market,
everyone loves this product

34:33.772 --> 34:35.073
because it's convenient.

34:35.173 --> 34:36.841
But it's a subset of people
that work out...
Mm-hmm.

34:36.942 --> 34:38.777
...that put on a plastic bag
on themselves.

34:38.877 --> 34:41.746
So how do I find them?
How are you finding them?
Yeah.

34:41.846 --> 34:43.281
I blew up on TikTok.

34:43.381 --> 34:46.818
One of my biggest videos is
17-- or 16 million,

34:46.918 --> 34:50.422
and we average about a million
a week on TikTok because--
Wow.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.190
O'Leary: What does that
translate into in sales?

34:52.290 --> 34:54.259
A million a week on TikTok
gets you what?

34:54.359 --> 34:57.195
Sure. So when I first started,
October 2020,

34:57.295 --> 35:00.332
I did $15,000 in sales
in those two months.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.733
I was like,
"I'm ready for 'Shark Tank.'

35:01.833 --> 35:03.835
Yes. 15K, it's more than I've
ever made in my life.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.070
Put me on."

35:05.170 --> 35:06.938
What shocked me was,
the next year,

35:07.038 --> 35:10.175
we did about $190,000
in sales in Q1.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.010
Really?
Yes, sir.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.512
And year to date now,
we're a little over 100K,

35:14.613 --> 35:16.581
and we're projected to do
a quarter million this year.
What?

35:16.681 --> 35:19.551
So how much did you do
in revenue last month?

35:19.651 --> 35:21.987
We did about $23,000.

35:22.087 --> 35:24.456
And how much did you
make out of that?

35:24.556 --> 35:25.790
About $5,000.

35:25.890 --> 35:27.092
That's still not bad.
That's not bad.

35:27.192 --> 35:29.060
Now, are you running--
Tell us about you.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.328
Tell us about
your background.

35:30.428 --> 35:31.663
I'm an ex-college football player.

35:31.763 --> 35:32.831
Where'd you play?

35:32.931 --> 35:34.899
I played linebacker
for UTEP,

35:35.000 --> 35:36.334
University of Texas
at El Paso.

35:36.434 --> 35:38.570
Obviously, it didn't work out.
I broke my arm my senior year.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.538
But I'm a dad,
dad first, always.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.973
My wife and my son and I,

35:42.073 --> 35:44.309
you know, you spent the last
four years chasing the dream.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.745
I remember I was training
for these leagues,

35:46.845 --> 35:49.147
and I was using a trash bag,
just like I was saying.

35:49.247 --> 35:50.715
And I kept
feeling embarrassed

35:50.815 --> 35:52.717
leaving the house using
a trash bag.

35:52.817 --> 35:53.885
So then I would go

35:53.985 --> 35:55.620
and I would get
these reusable ones.

35:55.720 --> 35:56.955
Mind you,
I just got out of college.

35:57.055 --> 35:58.757
I have no money.
I keep spending $20

35:58.857 --> 36:00.725
on these reusable suits
that would rip on me

36:00.825 --> 36:02.994
every time I'm trying
to do a pass rush move.

36:03.094 --> 36:04.796
So it would rip on me,
and I remember I looked it up,

36:04.896 --> 36:07.198
and I said,
"Single-use sauna suit."

36:07.298 --> 36:08.800
And it didn't exist.
And I looked it up everywhere.

36:08.900 --> 36:09.934
I looked it up everywhere.

36:10.035 --> 36:11.770
And I remember
I turned to my wife, I said,

36:11.870 --> 36:14.072
"I'm going to start
a company called SweatSkinz."

36:14.172 --> 36:16.408
And she was like,
"Ugh, no."

36:16.508 --> 36:18.243
And then it hit me.
So ever since then,

36:18.343 --> 36:21.279
it's just been
a serious grind.

36:21.379 --> 36:24.049
I've been trying to get my
family back in the same house.

36:24.149 --> 36:26.151
I stay with a few friends,
sleeping on the couches,

36:26.251 --> 36:27.886
doing the
entrepreneurial thing.

36:27.986 --> 36:29.754
They stay with
my mother-in-law,

36:29.854 --> 36:31.456
and I've just been
grinding ever since.

36:31.556 --> 36:34.292
And it's been a journey,
but it's been great.

36:34.392 --> 36:35.527
You're making
five grand a month.

36:35.627 --> 36:36.895
Why are you living
in a separate house?

36:36.995 --> 36:38.930
Because I still--
I do owe debt.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.499
Tell us about the debt.
My debt comes from my partner.

36:41.599 --> 36:44.002
He kept giving us money
to keep the inventory demand up.

36:44.102 --> 36:45.670
How much have you raised?

36:45.770 --> 36:47.706
Well, he-- Okay, so he gave
me $25,000 for equity.

36:47.806 --> 36:48.973
He owns 25%.

36:49.074 --> 36:51.076
He put a loan through
the business for $100,000.

36:51.176 --> 36:52.577
$100,000?
Correct.

36:52.677 --> 36:54.045
Why can't
you live at home?

36:54.145 --> 36:56.881
Because I can't take a salary.
I-I have a job now.

36:56.981 --> 36:59.417
I had to get a job
two months ago.
That's fine.
That's fine. That's fine.

36:59.517 --> 37:01.653
And it's away from home?
It's not in the same city?
Correct.

37:01.753 --> 37:02.854
Yep. It's in Boston.
They're in South Carolina.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.122
Oh, got it.
There we go.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.156
So what are you doing
in Boston?

37:05.256 --> 37:06.424
Yep,
I work in cyber security.

37:06.524 --> 37:07.959
Boston is extremely expensive.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.928
Nothing against Boston, but
I'm leaving there as soon as I can.

37:10.028 --> 37:11.896
Kalaii, I want to understand
one thing.

37:11.996 --> 37:13.631
I see you here,
and you have,

37:13.732 --> 37:15.867
like, this supreme
self-confidence.

37:15.967 --> 37:19.003
But then you're telling me
a story where other people

37:19.104 --> 37:22.741
would be defeated
and depressed.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.175
But I feel like you're...
Yeah.

37:24.275 --> 37:25.443
...maybe 'cause
on national TV,

37:25.543 --> 37:28.847
not showing us
your struggles.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.783
Can you be very earnest about
where you are today

37:31.883 --> 37:33.017
with this this business
and with your life?

37:33.118 --> 37:34.519
100%.

37:34.619 --> 37:36.421
And honestly, full
transparency, I always told myself

37:36.521 --> 37:38.022
I would never come
onto "Shark Tank" and cry,

37:38.123 --> 37:39.791
but it's because
I've been through worse.

37:39.891 --> 37:43.294
When I was 13 or 14,
I lost both my parents.

37:43.394 --> 37:46.197
I had to find a way through
football to get a scholarship.

37:46.297 --> 37:49.067
I have a little brother
that I had to help take care of.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.136
I've been through worse.
And I have a son.

37:51.236 --> 37:54.506
I'm a dad, so I can't--
I can't fold.

37:54.606 --> 37:58.042
Like, I can't-- like,
I have to make him proud

37:58.143 --> 38:01.112
because my dad made me proud
when he was an entrepreneur.

38:01.212 --> 38:02.380
I told myself
I wasn't going to cry,

38:02.480 --> 38:04.382
but, like,
I-I have no other choice.

38:04.482 --> 38:08.219
Like, I owe debt,
and I pay it back every month.

38:08.319 --> 38:09.587
I went and got a job
because I didn't want

38:09.687 --> 38:10.789
to take from the business.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.091
Everything I put back
was into the business.

38:13.191 --> 38:15.260
I don't like owing anything
to anybody.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.096
I have a son that I want
to pass this down to one day.

38:18.196 --> 38:20.131
I never thought
I would create this business.

38:20.231 --> 38:21.599
It seems silly
when you think about it.

38:21.699 --> 38:23.101
You think of,
like, a trash bag.

38:23.201 --> 38:24.636
But they say some of
the craziest inventions

38:24.736 --> 38:26.137
that you come up with,

38:26.237 --> 38:28.606
come up with things that
you've already done every
single day.

38:28.706 --> 38:31.176
How much inventory
do you have right now?

38:31.276 --> 38:32.977
About $35,000 worth.

38:33.077 --> 38:34.712
How much did you pay
for the inventory?

38:34.813 --> 38:36.214
We bought $80,000 worth.

38:36.314 --> 38:39.384
Our cost is $4.17
per 5-pack.

38:39.484 --> 38:40.852
We sell it for $19.99.

38:40.952 --> 38:44.222
What is a minimum-size order
from the the maker?

38:44.322 --> 38:47.458
10,000 to get it
to that cost of 55 cents.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.594
It's $4.20
for 5 in a package, right?

38:49.694 --> 38:51.062
And that includes
the packaging?

38:51.162 --> 38:52.063
Yup.
Right.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.866
And so, there's 5 of them.
That's $2.75.

38:54.966 --> 38:57.368
So the packaging itself
is a $1.50?
Right.

38:57.468 --> 39:00.305
For me, I don't see how
there's room for an investor
in this,

39:00.405 --> 39:01.339
or other investors.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.007
He's ahead of me
on the cap table.

39:03.107 --> 39:04.242
I'm an equity investor.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.743
He's got the debt.
He's first.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.045
I get it.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.080
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.415
Thank you. Um...

39:10.515 --> 39:12.217
I guess,
to really answer that again,

39:12.317 --> 39:14.485
if I have the inventory,
I will sell the inventory.

39:14.586 --> 39:17.055
There has never been a problem
with me sitting on inventory.

39:17.155 --> 39:18.890
Last year, we sold out
five times.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.291
How are you
selling this right now?

39:20.391 --> 39:22.227
Only direct to consumer
or in any stores?

39:22.327 --> 39:23.695
Only direct to the consumer.

39:23.795 --> 39:26.297
So, I think there's tons of
merit to what you've done here.

39:26.397 --> 39:28.900
Sometimes you take the nugget
of the simplest idea

39:29.000 --> 39:30.902
and you turn it into something
that really can become

39:31.002 --> 39:32.103
something great.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.205
You're so honorable
and so good.

39:34.305 --> 39:35.273
I love you.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.008
I just don't think
that the product

39:37.108 --> 39:38.409
is the right fit
with me.

39:38.509 --> 39:40.111
So for that reason,
I'm out.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.813
Thank you so much, Lori.
I appreciate it.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.014
Daniel,
what are you doing?

39:43.114 --> 39:45.917
I love you, man,
because you're so honest.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.218
You're so honest,

39:47.318 --> 39:49.787
and you're so real,
and you don't give up,

39:49.888 --> 39:51.422
and you're hanging
by a thread,

39:51.522 --> 39:52.824
and you're just going for it.

39:52.924 --> 39:55.026
So I would love
to give you a hand.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.095
I will give you the $60,000,

39:57.195 --> 40:00.698
and I'll do my best to give
you a hand for your 20%.

40:00.798 --> 40:01.933
Thank you so much. Um...

40:02.033 --> 40:03.234
Wow.
Yeah.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.637
He just offered you exactly
what you came in asking for.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.473
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.240
Let's talk.

40:21.152 --> 40:22.820
Two Sharks are out,

40:22.921 --> 40:24.088
and Daniel has offered Kalaii

40:24.188 --> 40:26.591
exactly what he came in
asking for--

40:26.691 --> 40:28.793
$60,000 for 20%

40:28.893 --> 40:32.030
of his single-use sauna suit
company, ShredSkinz.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.032
But Mark may also
be interested.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.034
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

40:36.134 --> 40:37.368
Let's talk.

40:37.468 --> 40:39.537
If you were to send an order
to somebody

40:39.637 --> 40:41.606
that didn't have
the fancy bag... Right.

40:41.706 --> 40:43.041
...would they
still be happy?

40:43.141 --> 40:45.243
I mean, there's a handsome guy
on the back of there, but, um...

40:46.678 --> 40:47.979
Not really.
But, yes, they will--

40:48.079 --> 40:49.447
they will be happy.
They're not gonna care, right?

40:49.547 --> 40:52.317
Correct.
Right, so you can add
almost 10% more,

40:52.417 --> 40:53.718
a $1.50 more per unit.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.320
And you sold 12,000 units, right?

40:55.420 --> 40:57.488
That's $18,000
in your pocket... Right.

40:57.588 --> 40:58.656
...if you don't use these.

40:58.756 --> 41:00.458
So now, all of a sudden,
you're making money.

41:00.558 --> 41:01.993
So, I'll do the deal.

41:02.093 --> 41:04.462
I can help you just with
basic guidance, right?

41:04.562 --> 41:07.932
So I'll give you the 60 grand
for the 20%.

41:08.032 --> 41:09.133
Wow.

41:09.233 --> 41:10.935
What are you looking for?
What do you need?

41:11.035 --> 41:13.338
Manufacturing and inventory,
for sure.

41:13.438 --> 41:15.907
Well, you do have two offers.
Daymond, what are you doing?

41:16.007 --> 41:19.277
I think you need to consider
the offers on the table.

41:19.377 --> 41:20.745
Yeah, for sure.

41:23.848 --> 41:26.684
I want to say, I-I love the
way you feel about me.

41:26.784 --> 41:28.419
I-I appreciate that passion,

41:28.519 --> 41:30.121
and that alm--
that really made me tear up.

41:30.221 --> 41:31.756
And I appreciate that. I'm
glad that you see that in me,

41:31.856 --> 41:33.558
and I'm glad all of you
see that on me,

41:33.658 --> 41:35.426
because I'm very hard
on myself

41:35.526 --> 41:37.161
because I have to be
that rock for my son.

41:37.261 --> 41:40.798
I can't let him see the
struggles that I do go through.

41:40.898 --> 41:42.266
Um...

41:43.301 --> 41:46.337
But with that being said,
Mark, you got yourself a deal.

41:46.437 --> 41:47.372
Let's go.

41:47.472 --> 41:48.806
Let's go!

41:48.906 --> 41:50.475
Congratulations.

41:50.575 --> 41:52.844
Yes, sir.
Good job, man.

41:53.478 --> 41:56.080
We'll get this done.
We'll get this done.
Yes, sir.
Thank you so much.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.216
Congrats!
You just won in the Tank.
Thank you, guys.
I appreciate you.

41:58.316 --> 41:59.283
Thank you.

41:59.384 --> 42:00.418
Good luck, Kalaii.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.719
Thank you so much.

42:01.819 --> 42:02.954
Do I help clean this up?

42:03.054 --> 42:04.689
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about that.

42:04.789 --> 42:06.524
Alright.
Aww.
Hard-working man.

42:06.624 --> 42:08.359
Yes, sir.
He's so sweet.
He's like, "Can I clean up?"

42:08.459 --> 42:11.262
I've never seen an
entrepreneur pick up his own trash.

42:11.362 --> 42:12.330
I know, right?

42:12.430 --> 42:14.132
Let's go, man!

42:14.232 --> 42:15.433
Let's go!

42:15.533 --> 42:17.869
Though I loved Daniel
and I loved his offer

42:17.969 --> 42:19.537
and I appreciate him,

42:19.637 --> 42:21.672
I felt like Mark
was more up my alley,

42:21.773 --> 42:23.608
and I feel like
I can expand more

42:23.708 --> 42:25.877
with having someone
like Mark Cuban on board.
