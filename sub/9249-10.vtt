WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:08.846
You have anything to drink tonight?

00:08.848 --> 00:11.149
No, I haven't, Officer.

00:13.051 --> 00:14.886
All right, you're good. Drive safe.

00:14.888 --> 00:16.954
I got to tell you,

00:16.956 --> 00:19.090
I hate doing these checkpoints.

00:19.092 --> 00:21.192
Why? 'Cause a warrentless search
without probable cause

00:21.194 --> 00:22.727
could be construed as unconstitutional?

00:22.729 --> 00:25.429
No, I just hate all the standing.

00:25.431 --> 00:26.764
That's because you do it all wrong.

00:26.766 --> 00:28.432
You got to bend your knees a little bit.

00:28.434 --> 00:30.434
You know, use your abs.
You got... (panting)

00:30.436 --> 00:32.603
You got to harness your chi.

00:32.604 --> 00:36.240
Looks like you're taking a chi.

00:36.242 --> 00:37.675
I actually don't mind
working these checkpoints.

00:37.677 --> 00:39.710
Being outside, meeting new people,

00:39.712 --> 00:41.011
the adrenaline rush you get

00:41.013 --> 00:43.214
when you see that “oh, crap”
look in the driver's eyes.

00:44.683 --> 00:45.716
Aw, crap.

00:45.718 --> 00:47.051
That's the look.

00:47.053 --> 00:48.986
JOYCE: Oh, good, it's you.

00:48.988 --> 00:51.922
I put in a stick of gum
for nothing. Let me chew it.

00:51.924 --> 00:53.724
Okay, I-I can't just do that, Joyce.

00:53.726 --> 00:55.492
I got to ask you some questions.

00:55.494 --> 00:58.562
I got a question for you...
did you pick up my dry cleaning?

00:58.564 --> 01:00.898
Uh, have you had anything to drink tonight?

01:00.900 --> 01:04.268
Have you had anything to eat?
We can play this game all night.

01:04.269 --> 01:06.837
Joyce, quit messing around...
my supervisors are right there.

01:06.839 --> 01:09.006
Just tell me, have you
had anything to drink?

01:09.008 --> 01:11.041
I don't have to tell you a damn thing.

01:11.043 --> 01:13.711
I know my rights... I watch <i> The Mentalist.</i>

01:13.713 --> 01:16.419
Look, if you don't answer the question,

01:16.421 --> 01:18.582
I got to take you out of the car
and give you a sobriety test.

01:18.584 --> 01:20.651
What do you want, the alphabet backwards?

01:20.653 --> 01:22.653
Z-Y-X-W-V-U-T.

01:22.655 --> 01:24.888
How about in German? <i>Tsett, oopsilon, ix.</i>

01:24.890 --> 01:26.290
Auf Wiedersehen.

01:26.292 --> 01:28.191
Hey, hey, hey!

01:28.193 --> 01:30.827
I'm just gonna see what's going
on in this Mazda back here.

01:32.263 --> 01:34.064
Coward.

01:34.066 --> 01:36.333
You've seen me drunk. This is not drunk.

01:36.335 --> 01:39.036
Now, stop being a jackass
and let me through. Hey,

01:39.038 --> 01:41.138
I am a police officer...
how about a little respect?

01:41.140 --> 01:42.572
How about I run over your fat foot

01:42.574 --> 01:43.940
if you don't get out of the way.

01:43.942 --> 01:46.643
- Step out of the vehicle, ma'am.
- Or what?

01:46.645 --> 01:48.578
I'm your mother-in-law!

01:48.580 --> 01:51.648
You don't have the balls to arrest me.

01:52.617 --> 01:56.353
(kicking partition) Fascists! Fascists!

01:56.355 --> 01:58.188
We should have cuffed her ankles.

01:58.190 --> 01:59.723
Just get us to the station.

01:59.725 --> 02:04.194
I don't know how long
the glass is gonna hold.

I'd appreciate if my name

02:35.481 --> 02:36.901
doesn't appear on the arrest report.

02:36.983 --> 02:38.949
That's my girlfriend's mom

Thanks, I appreciate your support.

I'm not saying you didn't do
the right thing...

02:45.358 --> 02:47.158
I'm just saying
I don't have your back on this.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.960
Oh, my God, I came as soon as you called.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.263
Okay, don't worry, your mother's fine.

02:52.265 --> 02:54.131
I'm not worried about her;
I'm worried about you.

02:54.133 --> 02:56.867
You know, they have
to let her out <i> sometime.</i>

02:56.869 --> 02:59.603
Well, I had to take her in...
she refused to comply

02:59.605 --> 03:01.705
with an officer's request,
became confrontational,

03:01.707 --> 03:04.975
and spit a wad of Juicy Fruit at me!

03:04.977 --> 03:06.777
What was I supposed to do?

03:06.779 --> 03:08.412
I don't know, but now you just lit

03:08.414 --> 03:09.613
a 90-pound stick of dynamite.

03:09.615 --> 03:11.515
You know she's gonna make
our lives a living...

Hell-o!

03:13.386 --> 03:15.419
Here you go, Ms. Flynn.

03:15.421 --> 03:17.154
I'm gonna take your handcuffs off,

03:17.156 --> 03:18.856
just like we talked about.

03:18.858 --> 03:23.060
Nobody's gonna get scratched,
poked or pinched, right?

03:24.496 --> 03:26.463
(chuckles) Were you in a holding cell

03:26.465 --> 03:30.267
or a beauty parlor? 'Cause you look great!

03:32.003 --> 03:33.770
Here's your things, Joyce.

03:33.772 --> 03:34.705
Go to Hell.

03:34.707 --> 03:37.808
(chuckles): Oh... you rascal.

03:37.810 --> 03:39.543
Why don't we just scoot on...

03:39.545 --> 03:41.945
God! Scoot on home.

03:41.947 --> 03:43.947
All right, I'll see you at the house.

03:43.949 --> 03:46.950
You know what, she seems
a little, um... stabby.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.554
Maybe just sleep somewhere else tonight.

03:50.556 --> 03:51.621
Well, fine, I guess I could sleep...

03:51.623 --> 03:53.323
Uh! Don't tell me. If I don't know,

03:53.325 --> 03:54.958
she can't get it out of me.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.598
Just so you know,

04:01.600 --> 04:03.867
the springs in your
fold-out couch are shot.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.636
Yes. I heard them
begging for mercy last night.

04:07.638 --> 04:10.440
Well, you could have slept in my bed.

04:10.442 --> 04:12.475
I was snug as a bug in Victoria's rug

04:12.477 --> 04:13.476
over at your house.

04:13.478 --> 04:17.947
And by “rug,” I mean... I got it, I got it.

04:17.950 --> 04:19.548
You were smart to stay away, though.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.152
That little firecracker got
angrier as the night went on.

04:22.154 --> 04:24.220
She kept throwing your
clothes out the window.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.656
But God bless Molly... she
kept bringin 'em back in.

04:26.658 --> 04:30.460
It was in, out... in, out...

04:30.462 --> 04:32.962
It was like some weird Japanese game show.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.666
Well, did you make any effort at all

04:36.668 --> 04:38.568
- to explain <i> my</i> side of things?
- Well, sort of.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.203
I explained <i> my</i> side of things.

04:40.205 --> 04:41.704
You know, you're a loose cannon,

04:41.706 --> 04:43.673
I can't control you, blah, blah, blah.

04:45.676 --> 04:48.711
It really helped Mom and me
get closer together.

04:48.713 --> 04:50.713
- Mom?
- Hey, somebody's got to fill the void

04:50.715 --> 04:52.515
now that you're dead to her.

04:53.851 --> 04:56.786
Well, if you really want to get
back in Joyce's good graces,

04:56.788 --> 04:58.021
I know just the thing.

04:58.023 --> 05:00.456
As the new owner of Abe's,
may I suggest our...

05:00.458 --> 05:03.726
“any occasion muffin basket.”

05:03.728 --> 05:05.661
Perfect for birthdays, anniversaries,

05:05.663 --> 05:08.865
or just to say “sorry I had to arrest you.”

05:08.867 --> 05:10.466
Look, this is on Joyce.

05:10.468 --> 05:11.901
I may have been a little too by-the-book,

05:11.903 --> 05:13.903
but I am a cop,
and she needs to respect that.

05:13.905 --> 05:15.171
SAMUEL: You know,

05:15.173 --> 05:19.475
nothing says respect
like an Abe's travel mug.

05:20.844 --> 05:22.378
If it goes in hot, it stays hot.

05:22.380 --> 05:24.213
If it goes in cold, it stays cold.

05:24.215 --> 05:26.649
Please, buy one.

05:26.651 --> 05:29.919
I have 2,000 of these things.

05:31.188 --> 05:32.922
Let me take a look at that.

05:34.191 --> 05:37.059
You think Mom would
like something like this?

05:42.032 --> 05:42.998
Hey, Vince.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.166
What are you doin'?

05:44.168 --> 05:45.501
You gotta get out of here.

05:45.503 --> 05:46.769
We just calmed Joyce down.

05:46.771 --> 05:48.003
Come on. I live here, too.

05:48.005 --> 05:49.138
For now.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.973
Joyce tried to evict
your clothes last night.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.908
But that wife of yours
shimmied up that tree

05:52.910 --> 05:56.412
and rescued your big undies
like they were a stuck kite.

05:57.614 --> 05:59.081
Hey, sweetie.

05:59.083 --> 06:00.082
What are you doing here?

06:00.084 --> 06:01.784
We just calmed her down.

06:01.786 --> 06:02.785
What am I supposed to do?

06:02.787 --> 06:04.053
I can't stay away forever.

06:04.055 --> 06:05.287
Not forever, just for a while.

06:05.289 --> 06:07.389
Come here, it'll be fun,
we'll meet in secret.

06:07.391 --> 06:09.291
Just like we're having an affair.

06:09.293 --> 06:13.195
Mol, your tea... What are you doing here?

06:14.564 --> 06:17.366
They just calmed me down.

06:17.368 --> 06:20.369
Look, Joyce, uh... I don't,
I don't want any trouble.

06:20.371 --> 06:21.670
Then what'd you come around here for?

06:21.672 --> 06:23.372
Because I miss my wife.

06:23.374 --> 06:25.974
And I'm out of socks.

06:25.976 --> 06:28.577
There's a whole bag of 'em
in the tree out front.

06:28.579 --> 06:31.613
I couldn't reach those.
I climbed as high as I could.

06:33.716 --> 06:35.250
Please, can't we just move on?

06:35.252 --> 06:37.886
Look... muffins.

06:37.888 --> 06:39.521
Move on?!

06:39.523 --> 06:41.623
You handcuffed me and threw me in the back

06:41.625 --> 06:43.825
of your squad car like I was Red John.

06:43.827 --> 06:44.893
Red John?

06:44.895 --> 06:47.462
The villain on <i> The Mentalist!</i>

06:48.998 --> 06:50.599
All right, let's not overreact.

06:50.601 --> 06:52.567
Or what? You gonna pepper spray me?

06:52.569 --> 06:55.236
Hey... I did not pepper spray her.

06:55.238 --> 06:58.106
Let's be real clear on that.

06:58.108 --> 06:59.074
I hope you're happy.

06:59.076 --> 07:00.609
You've torn this family apart.

07:01.844 --> 07:03.344
She didn't cooperate!

07:03.346 --> 07:05.213
All you had to do was answer the question:

07:05.215 --> 07:06.948
“Did you drink tonight?”

07:06.950 --> 07:08.316
That's a pretty loaded question,

07:08.318 --> 07:10.585
'cause you know she was probably loaded.

07:11.854 --> 07:13.621
I was not!

07:13.623 --> 07:14.622
That's not perjury.

07:14.624 --> 07:16.791
She's not under oath.

07:16.793 --> 07:19.761
How come everybody's assuming I was tanked?

07:19.763 --> 07:22.664
Come on, Mom, it was after 6:00.

07:24.266 --> 07:25.934
What is that supposed to mean?

07:25.936 --> 07:29.304
It means we love you and accept
you just the way you are...

07:29.306 --> 07:32.674
half in the bag and all in our hearts.

07:32.676 --> 07:34.609
Really?

07:34.611 --> 07:36.077
Oh, you think I got a problem?

07:36.079 --> 07:38.680
Well,<i> you're</i> the ones who have problems!

07:38.682 --> 07:40.014
Victoria, pot!

07:40.016 --> 07:41.549
Vince, porn!

07:41.551 --> 07:43.885
You, pie!

07:45.421 --> 07:47.355
You know, you do all have those vices.

07:47.357 --> 07:48.456
You, shopping.

07:48.458 --> 07:49.957
(gasping): Mother...!

07:51.026 --> 07:53.194
I can quit drinking any time I want.

07:53.196 --> 07:56.030
Can any of you say the same
about your nasty habits?

07:56.032 --> 07:56.998
I could stop tomorrow.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.165
- Of course.
- Yeah, probably...

07:58.167 --> 08:00.301
I mean, it's not a porn “problem”"

08:00.303 --> 08:03.270
I watch the romantic ones,
directed by ladies.

08:05.641 --> 08:09.176
You know... maybe Dudley Dipstick here

08:09.178 --> 08:11.445
gave us a wake-up call.

08:11.447 --> 08:14.215
We should all clean up our acts.

08:14.217 --> 08:15.583
Yeah.

08:15.585 --> 08:18.452
In fact, let's start with the pot head.

08:18.454 --> 08:21.122
Mom, what are you doing with my purse?

08:22.157 --> 08:24.892
Mom, not my pot...
I was saving that for church.

08:24.894 --> 08:26.460
(garbage disposal humming)

08:26.462 --> 08:27.828
(humming stops)

08:27.830 --> 08:31.565
If I'm gonna live clean,
you're all gonna live clean.

08:31.567 --> 08:33.866
Hey, those are my chips!

08:33.869 --> 08:35.102
You said Victoria bought those.

08:35.104 --> 08:36.337
Are we doing this now?

08:36.339 --> 08:38.739
Wait a minute... Mom, Mom! Those are mine!

08:38.741 --> 08:40.274
And your credit cards are next!

08:40.275 --> 08:41.842
Mike, go get your Taser!

08:42.777 --> 08:46.046
And Vince, I know where your skin mags are.

08:46.048 --> 08:47.047
You're bluffing!

08:47.049 --> 08:48.248
Try me.

09:03.651 --> 09:05.152
Mom,

09:05.154 --> 09:07.461
I know you don't want to be in
the same room as Mike right now,

09:07.490 --> 09:09.456
but he was wondering how much longer

09:09.458 --> 09:12.126
you were gonna be using the kitchen.

09:12.128 --> 09:15.028
Until I'm done with breakfast.

09:15.030 --> 09:17.297
Well, you just have that...

09:17.299 --> 09:19.499
tomato left there, so you might want

09:19.501 --> 09:22.502
to scarf that down
and get on with your day.

09:22.504 --> 09:25.238
I'm not scarfing anything.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.774
I'm gonna savor it.

09:27.776 --> 09:30.410
You learn to appreciate
the small things in life,

09:30.412 --> 09:34.614
like a tomato, after you've done hard time.

09:34.616 --> 09:38.318
You were in a cell for 40 minutes.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.820
Then that's how long I'm gonna eat

09:39.822 --> 09:42.389
this tasteless freakin' tomato.

09:44.325 --> 09:46.426
(whispering): I'm sorry.

09:46.428 --> 09:47.828
(quietly): Come on. I'm starving.

09:47.830 --> 09:51.765
Throw me an apple or a bagel, anything.

09:51.767 --> 09:54.200
- Aw, you threw me an apple.
- Shh. Just go.

09:57.605 --> 09:59.706
Mom, it's been two days.

09:59.708 --> 10:02.342
- Are you gonna stay mad forever?
- No.

10:02.344 --> 10:04.377
Just for the next 12 months.

10:04.379 --> 10:05.545
That's how long

10:05.547 --> 10:08.114
they're taking away my driver's license.

10:08.116 --> 10:12.285
Because your bozo husband
couldn't just wave me through.

10:12.287 --> 10:14.254
Oh, my God. 12 months?

10:14.256 --> 10:17.223
Wow. He, um... Yeah, I d... I didn't, uh...

10:17.225 --> 10:20.727
I didn't realize that it...
But we're still good, right?

10:25.232 --> 10:27.100
Huh.

10:27.102 --> 10:28.801
That's a good apple.

10:28.803 --> 10:30.970
I didn't even miss the caramel.

10:32.773 --> 10:34.374
What's going on?

10:34.376 --> 10:36.476
- Shh. Keep it down.
- Why?

10:36.478 --> 10:38.711
You guys throwing dice
or hiding from Colonel Klink?

10:38.713 --> 10:40.980
It's not fair.

10:40.982 --> 10:42.949
Drinkin' and smokin' behind the garage.

10:42.951 --> 10:45.151
What am I, ten?

10:46.220 --> 10:47.787
And you had to go take her license, too.

10:47.789 --> 10:51.090
Now I got to spend the next year
driving Miss Crazy.

10:51.092 --> 10:53.059
What was I supposed to do?

10:53.061 --> 10:54.327
She broke the law.

10:54.329 --> 10:56.162
Let's take a look at that word, “law”"

10:56.164 --> 10:57.697
There's the letter of the law,

10:57.699 --> 10:59.165
and then there's your mother-in-law.

10:59.167 --> 11:02.401
Which one can kill you in your sleep?

11:02.403 --> 11:04.370
There's nothing I can do
about it at this point.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.404
Really?

11:05.406 --> 11:07.473
You can't make a ticket just go away?

11:07.475 --> 11:08.841
No, I cannot.

11:08.843 --> 11:10.576
Sounds like a maybe.

11:10.578 --> 11:13.079
What are you saying?

11:13.081 --> 11:14.680
I'm saying you work hard,

11:14.682 --> 11:16.882
and you deserve a little relaxation.

11:16.884 --> 11:20.119
Say, courtside Bull
tickets for this Saturday.

11:20.121 --> 11:22.154
- Are you trying to bribe me?
- See?

11:22.156 --> 11:23.289
He's confused like I was.

11:23.291 --> 11:26.358
Just say, “We would like to bribe you.”

11:26.360 --> 11:28.561
Unbelievable. This conversation is over.

11:28.563 --> 11:29.962
(sighs)

11:29.964 --> 11:31.697
What are we gonna do now?

11:31.699 --> 11:34.333
I was thinking an awning,
a couple of lawn chairs.

11:34.335 --> 11:37.636
We could make it real nice out here.
(groans)

11:40.840 --> 11:43.442
It's so nice of you to run me
around like this, Carl.

11:43.444 --> 11:44.910
Aw, it is my pleasure.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.845
Gives us a chance to know
each other a little better.

11:46.847 --> 11:48.247
Huh? Find our common interests.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.083
I didn't know you were such
a fan of water aerobics.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.018
Well, you ladies looked like
you were having so much fun,

11:53.020 --> 11:54.653
I just had to join in.

11:54.655 --> 11:57.656
L-Luckily, I always keep
a spare swimsuit in my car.

11:57.658 --> 12:00.759
You know, just in case of a water rescue.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.861
You were a big hit in that Speedo.

12:02.863 --> 12:06.798
Well, people see the flag,
they get very patriotic.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.369
I'm so glad you and Victoria
found each other.

12:10.371 --> 12:13.138
Aw. At least one of my
daughters picked a good man.

12:13.140 --> 12:14.372
Aw, now, now, now.

12:14.374 --> 12:17.042
I mean, it's true.

12:17.044 --> 12:19.411
I am pretty wonderful.

12:19.413 --> 12:20.912
Mike's a hell of a guy, too.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.714
Who arrested his mother-in-law.

12:22.716 --> 12:24.116
You did kind of put him in a tough spot.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.151
Are you telling me
you would've done what he did?

12:26.153 --> 12:28.320
No, I would not have. In fact,
I got the hell out of there.

12:28.322 --> 12:30.589
Because you were smart. No, because
I was scared to death. You're like

12:30.591 --> 12:32.390
a little red-headed honey badger.

12:32.392 --> 12:34.226
I've seen men twice your size not be able

12:34.228 --> 12:35.927
to kick out the Plexiglas of a squad car.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.963
And they were high on angel dust.

12:37.965 --> 12:41.032
I hold all my anger in my hips.

12:41.034 --> 12:44.402
Well, you can say plenty of
things about Mike Biggs, but...

12:44.404 --> 12:47.806
it took a lot of courage for
him to do his job that day.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.808
That's all he was doing.

12:49.810 --> 12:52.077
His job.

12:52.912 --> 12:55.113
Well, you're a good friend.

12:55.115 --> 12:57.382
Better than he deserves.

12:57.384 --> 13:00.285
Thanks.

13:00.287 --> 13:02.520
- Mom.
- We're not there yet.

13:02.522 --> 13:05.657
Yeah, I was just taking
it for a walk. We're cool.

13:09.428 --> 13:11.262
See? Isn't this better than copping a squat

13:11.264 --> 13:13.564
behind the garage with Vince and Victoria?

13:13.566 --> 13:14.832
I don't know. It's not that bad

13:14.834 --> 13:17.001
since they hung the Christmas lights.

13:17.003 --> 13:19.671
It's freezing cold back there.
Why do they need a mini fridge?

13:19.673 --> 13:21.973
(chuckles) I just keep going over

13:21.975 --> 13:23.641
that night with Joyce in my head.

13:23.643 --> 13:25.543
I should have done
what surgeons do with family:

13:25.545 --> 13:27.378
had somebody else operate.

13:27.380 --> 13:29.380
Removed myself from the situation,

13:29.382 --> 13:31.916
called over another officer
who wasn't related,

13:31.918 --> 13:33.985
and had him do the sobriety check.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.320
- Well, why don't you tell my mom that?
- She refuses

13:36.322 --> 13:38.556
to be in the same room as me.

13:38.558 --> 13:40.825
I know. That's why I didn't
tell her you'd be here.

13:40.827 --> 13:43.294
- What?
- Mom, we're over here.

13:43.296 --> 13:44.762
Are you crazy?

13:44.764 --> 13:46.497
No, she is. But we're in public,

13:46.499 --> 13:48.499
so you'll probably be okay.

13:48.501 --> 13:50.134
What the hell is this?

13:50.136 --> 13:52.603
This is a peace summit.
And you two are gonna talk

13:52.605 --> 13:55.639
and not come home until you've
negotiated a settlement.

13:55.641 --> 13:57.074
Or until last call.

13:57.076 --> 13:59.744
In that case, here's some cab money.

13:59.746 --> 14:01.178
Well, where are you going?

14:01.180 --> 14:03.247
Home. I'm gonna try to win
back some of the money I lost

14:03.249 --> 14:05.816
playing dice with Vince and Victoria.

14:17.629 --> 14:18.762
Spanish peanut?

14:18.764 --> 14:20.965
I'm good.

14:23.701 --> 14:25.936
Look, about the other night...

14:25.938 --> 14:27.905
- Nobody's proud of what happened.
- Just listen to me.

14:27.907 --> 14:29.173
(sighs)

14:29.175 --> 14:32.309
The reason I was so nasty to you

14:32.311 --> 14:35.512
was because I may have had a few.

14:35.514 --> 14:38.515
It was stupid and I was embarrassed

14:38.517 --> 14:41.318
and I shouldn't have been driving.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.320
(sighs)

14:43.322 --> 14:44.521
Okay.

14:44.523 --> 14:46.256
I wasn't drunk.

14:46.258 --> 14:48.859
But I wasn't exactly sober.

14:48.861 --> 14:51.662
So I took the easier way out.

14:51.664 --> 14:53.230
That was the easier way?

14:53.232 --> 14:55.132
No.

14:55.134 --> 14:59.169
Because I ran into an honest cop
who was just doing his job.

14:59.171 --> 15:01.471
Well, thank you.

15:01.473 --> 15:04.441
Does this mean I can have
my kitchen privileges back?

15:04.443 --> 15:07.744
Yes. Mostly 'cause I need you
to fix the sink.

15:07.746 --> 15:10.580
Molly's credit cards really did
a number on the disposal.

15:10.582 --> 15:11.915
(chuckles)

15:11.917 --> 15:13.950
But I-it did shred them, right?

15:13.952 --> 15:15.919
Oh, yeah.

15:15.921 --> 15:18.922
Since we're both here, uh,

15:18.924 --> 15:20.390
can I buy you a drink?

15:20.392 --> 15:21.658
Sure.

15:21.660 --> 15:23.526
I'll have a club soda and lime.

15:23.528 --> 15:24.794
Wow, look at you.

15:24.796 --> 15:27.997
- Don't get used to it.
- Okay.

15:30.901 --> 15:33.603
So, do you do a lot of water rescues?

15:33.605 --> 15:37.874
Um, how-how come Captain America
keeps a Speedo in the car?

15:37.876 --> 15:41.911
He saved one dog from one pool one time.

15:41.913 --> 15:45.214
Oh, my God, my song.

15:45.216 --> 15:46.783
♪ Slow ride ♪

15:46.785 --> 15:49.485
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:49.487 --> 15:51.587

15:51.589 --> 15:54.023
We get it. You're drunk. Keep it down.

15:54.025 --> 15:56.159
Oh, excuse me. I am not drunk.

15:56.161 --> 15:58.361
This is club soda.

15:58.363 --> 15:59.762
So, you're just loud and obnoxious?

15:59.764 --> 16:00.963
Yes!

16:00.965 --> 16:03.132
(whooping)

16:03.134 --> 16:05.535
- Clam up, lady.
- Hey, watch yourself.

16:05.537 --> 16:07.070
Now, that's my mother-in-law
you're talking to.

16:07.072 --> 16:09.806
I suggest you stand over there
if we're bothering you so much.

16:09.808 --> 16:10.907
Got a better idea.

16:10.909 --> 16:12.208
- Why don't you and I step outside?
- Listen,

16:12.210 --> 16:13.809
nobody's looking for trouble tonight, so...

16:13.811 --> 16:17.113
Bar fight!

JOYCE: Hey?

16:36.801 --> 16:39.535
See? This just proves you don't
have to drink to have fun.

16:39.537 --> 16:40.936
(yelling)

16:40.938 --> 16:42.938
♪ Slow ride... ♪

16:42.940 --> 16:45.140

16:51.554 --> 16:53.755
The other party isn't filing charges.

16:53.757 --> 16:54.857
Mostly because he's embarrassed

16:54.859 --> 16:57.326
- he got his ass whupped by your mother.
- Oh.

16:57.328 --> 16:58.860
Well, he shouldn't be.

16:58.862 --> 17:00.662
I mean, once she gets on
you, she's like a tick.

17:00.664 --> 17:03.465
You got to burn her off.

17:03.467 --> 17:04.766
(sighs)

17:04.768 --> 17:07.469
I just hope she didn't ruin
that manicure we got today.

17:07.471 --> 17:09.570
Look how even that is.

17:09.573 --> 17:11.506
- Hey.
- MOLLY: Oh, my God.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.407
Are you two okay?

17:15.243 --> 17:17.412
I'm just saying... the holding tank?

17:17.414 --> 17:20.949
Not cop-friendly.

17:20.951 --> 17:22.651
My gals were sweet to me.

17:22.653 --> 17:24.352
I got two proposals.

17:24.354 --> 17:27.955
I know they were high as a
kite, but still, nice to hear.

17:27.958 --> 17:30.158
Come on, let's get the both of you home.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.427
- Yeah, I'm beat.
- Oh, you should be.

17:32.429 --> 17:35.363
Oh, you might be an honest cop,
but you're a dirty fighter.

17:35.365 --> 17:37.299
(laughs) Thank you.

17:37.301 --> 17:39.234
Molly, you got a winner here.

17:39.236 --> 17:43.471
I know. I don't climb
trees for just anybody.

17:43.473 --> 17:45.607
I'll be happy to escort
you to your car, Ms. Flynn.

17:45.609 --> 17:48.009
Just so you know, you've
moved back to number two.

17:48.011 --> 17:50.311
Come on, Mikey, let's go home.

17:51.147 --> 17:53.882
Oh, come on, don't worry.

17:53.884 --> 17:57.218
Mike'll do something stupid, and
you'll be back to number one.
