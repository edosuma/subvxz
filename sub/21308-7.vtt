Yeah?

01:32.540 --> 01:34.750
That was good. Huh?

01:35.790 --> 01:37.420
Oh, you're right.

01:37.420 --> 01:38.920
You're right, they were
a touch off key.

01:40.210 --> 01:41.790
Levitato!

01:41.790 --> 01:43.880
Aaah!

01:43.880 --> 01:45.880

Yes'm.

01:57.330 --> 02:00.790
Hmm. Remind me
to levitato Manfred.

02:03.710 --> 02:05.500
That is--is catchy.

02:08.920 --> 02:09.920
Huh?

02:32.290 --> 02:34.670
Are you out of your mind?

02:41.250 --> 02:42.710
Hmm?

02:42.710 --> 02:46.080
Hmm? But it's not a good time.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.420
You're talking
to your hand, dude.

02:48.420 --> 02:50.210
Hold on!
I have to take this.

02:50.210 --> 02:52.000
Ah, look, this is
not a good time

02:52.000 --> 02:53.670
to have this conversation.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.830
Okay, so, my hand said
I can't destroy you,

03:01.830 --> 03:04.710
so I have put you
in the dungeon.

03:04.710 --> 03:06.290
For the last time,

03:06.290 --> 03:08.580
where is dad?

03:08.580 --> 03:10.250
Didn't you hear the song?

03:10.250 --> 03:12.330
Ohh. I defeated him.

03:12.330 --> 03:13.920
I levitato'd him!

03:13.920 --> 03:15.080
And now I'm king.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.750
You what

03:17.750 --> 03:21.790
Levitato. Ta-tato. Tato!
Levitato!

03:21.790 --> 03:25.080
You're Princess of Mewni
and you don't even
know levitato?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.380
You don't know, do you?

03:26.380 --> 03:28.170
You're being controlled,
Ludo.

03:28.170 --> 03:31.540
You're right. You're right,
I am being controlled.

03:31.540 --> 03:34.170
Controlled by my lust for power!

03:34.170 --> 03:36.380
No, Ludo, you're being
controlled by Toffee.

03:36.380 --> 03:39.920
What? No, Toffee's dead!

03:39.920 --> 03:41.750
I did this. Me. See that?

03:41.750 --> 03:43.120
Me! Me!

03:43.120 --> 03:44.830
And now I'm doing this, too.

03:44.830 --> 03:47.540
Take her to the dungeon!

03:47.540 --> 03:49.830
It's your waaaaand!

03:53.710 --> 03:55.880
Ohh! You think
you're so tough!

03:55.880 --> 03:57.670
Get back here,
you jerks!

04:08.710 --> 04:10.080
Marco?
Star!

04:10.080 --> 04:11.750
Hai-yah!

04:11.750 --> 04:13.120
Ow ow ow ow ow ow!

04:13.120 --> 04:15.620
Okay, that was dumb.
Probably shoulda used the keys.

04:19.210 --> 04:20.710
I can't believe you're here.

04:20.710 --> 04:22.830
I was thinkin' we'd maybe
never see each other--

04:25.460 --> 04:27.040
Star?

04:27.040 --> 04:28.750
Your horns...

04:28.750 --> 04:30.250
are poking me.

04:30.250 --> 04:31.620
Take 'em off.

04:36.830 --> 04:39.040
Your stomach
just made a weird noise.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.080
Yeah, that was supposed
to be a surprise.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.460
I brought you this...
box of Captain Blanche's
Sugar Seeds.

04:44.460 --> 04:46.330
Sorry there's none left.

04:46.330 --> 04:48.920
Me and your dad ate 'em all
when were locked up
in the dungeon.

04:48.920 --> 04:52.290
Aw, man, you guys
got to eat cereal together
in the dungeon?

04:52.290 --> 04:53.460
Jealous.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.880
Star, your dad, he--

04:55.880 --> 04:59.330
Yeah, I know.
Ludo tev-a-tay-tato'd
ta-potato'd him.

04:59.330 --> 05:01.210
If Ludo mastered it,
it can't be dangerous.

05:01.210 --> 05:03.290
I think it's kinda bad, Star.

05:03.290 --> 05:05.750
Marco, honestly,
he's been through worse.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.500
Way worse.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.120
I think we have
bigger problems right now.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.880
Well, you're in luck, Star.

05:13.540 --> 05:15.460
Come on, guys,
we practiced this.

05:16.830 --> 05:18.790
Mourning dove?

05:18.790 --> 05:21.920
FOOLDUKE:
That's not what doves
sound like on Mewni.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.380
Argh! Just get down here.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.790
Star, allow me
to introduce...

05:28.790 --> 05:30.330
la resistance!

05:31.880 --> 05:33.120
MARCO: The easiest way
to depose a ruler

05:33.120 --> 05:35.790
is to destroy
his credibility.

05:35.790 --> 05:38.580
So this virtual pet
will represent Ludo.

05:38.580 --> 05:41.170
And this $650 is us.

05:41.170 --> 05:43.540
And this feather
is Bird and Spider.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.330
Normally, they're always
with him or nearby,

05:46.330 --> 05:50.670
except...Bird and Spider
break to feed
every five hours.

05:50.670 --> 05:53.670
When he's alone,
we take this air duct
to the throne room.

05:53.670 --> 05:55.790
And that's when Foolduke
hits him with...

05:55.790 --> 05:57.620
Rubber chicken!
No.

05:58.620 --> 06:00.750
How about whoopee cushion?

06:00.750 --> 06:02.920
No, we talked
about this before.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.420
Ruberiot?

06:04.420 --> 06:07.540
I have a ripping parody song
I've been working on.

06:07.540 --> 06:10.620
He is great at ruining
people's lives with songs.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.580
Marco, it seems like you guys
are just kinda playing pranks.

06:13.580 --> 06:17.620
Yeah, we're still workin' on
that payoff part.

06:17.620 --> 06:19.210
Okay, look,
what you're doing here is,

06:19.210 --> 06:20.710
like, totally super-admirable,

06:20.710 --> 06:22.540
and Marco, you've never
looked cuter in that beret,

06:22.540 --> 06:24.170
but Ludo
is not the problem here.

06:24.170 --> 06:25.750
Toffee is controlling him.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.710
And I don't think a song
is gonna fix things--

06:27.710 --> 06:29.750
Star, I was thinking ab--

06:31.330 --> 06:32.710
Guards!

06:36.170 --> 06:38.960
You'll never silence
the resistance!

06:38.960 --> 06:40.330
You! You're coming with me!

06:40.330 --> 06:41.330
Levitato.

06:41.330 --> 06:42.290
Aaaah!

06:42.290 --> 06:43.710
What the heck?

06:47.120 --> 06:49.080
STAR: Oh, of course.

06:50.880 --> 06:53.380
All right, Ludo.
What are you gonna do now?

06:53.380 --> 06:55.330
Levitato me again?

06:55.330 --> 06:57.540
Oh, I'm so scared.
That was the worst.

06:57.540 --> 07:01.750
Actually, you said
something earlier about my, um--

07:01.750 --> 07:03.250
about my--

07:04.330 --> 07:06.920
--about my W-O-N-D.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.880
Oh, so now you want my help?

07:08.880 --> 07:10.790
Of course I want help!

07:10.790 --> 07:13.420
I've been talking
to my own hand!

07:13.420 --> 07:15.500
It keeps me up all night!

07:15.500 --> 07:17.710
I can't sleep,
I can't think,

07:17.710 --> 07:21.670
I can't focus on my new job
as Mewni's beloved monarch!

07:21.670 --> 07:22.790
Wha

07:22.790 --> 07:24.750
Oh, hello.
Yes, of course.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.420
I

07:26.420 --> 07:28.120
Of course I'm beloved!

07:28.120 --> 07:29.750
Didn't you hear the song?

07:29.750 --> 07:32.710
Ludo! Why do you think
I came here without a wand?

07:32.710 --> 07:35.080
Because...
you were surrendering?

07:35.080 --> 07:37.710
It's corrupted! By Toffee!

07:37.710 --> 07:40.500
He's in the wands, Ludo!

07:40.500 --> 07:44.460
In the wa--
In the wands?!
Get him out!

07:44.460 --> 07:46.750
I don't want to be corrupted!
I don't want to be corrupted!

07:46.750 --> 07:49.460
How did he even get in there?
How did he even get in there?

07:49.460 --> 07:51.500
I don't know
how he got in there.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.960
The last time I saw him, he--

07:53.960 --> 07:56.790
Ooooooh.

07:56.790 --> 07:58.120
Yuck!

07:58.120 --> 07:59.920
Ludo, please.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.790
I think I know
how to get Toffee out.

08:02.790 --> 08:07.620
And then I can go back
to being a beloved monarch?

08:07.620 --> 08:11.210
Uh...yeah.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.500
ALL :
We are the resistance!

08:25.500 --> 08:27.540
We remain insistent!

08:27.540 --> 08:29.120
We're the resistance!

08:29.120 --> 08:31.750
You can't silence
the resistance!

08:31.750 --> 08:33.830
And gimme back my beret.

08:35.830 --> 08:37.120
Wait, why are you--

08:37.120 --> 08:38.420
Actually,

08:38.420 --> 08:40.210
the resistance
can be quieter.

08:40.210 --> 08:42.250
Be brave, Marco.

08:42.250 --> 08:45.830
You may fall,
but the resistance lives on!

08:45.830 --> 08:47.330
What?!

08:47.330 --> 08:49.580
Why just me?

08:52.250 --> 08:53.920
Karate boy.

08:55.540 --> 08:56.750
Buffrog!

08:56.750 --> 08:58.330
And...

08:58.330 --> 08:59.750
Marco!

08:59.750 --> 09:01.580
Queen Moon?

09:01.580 --> 09:03.620
Where's Star?
Ludo took her.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.580
We have to find him
before he does something awful.

09:05.580 --> 09:08.620
What about
arts and crafts
friends?

09:08.620 --> 09:11.750
The resistance
will live on without me.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.000
ALL: What?

09:19.420 --> 09:21.330
Star!

09:24.790 --> 09:25.790
Hey, Mommy.

09:25.790 --> 09:26.920
Hi, Marco.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I, uh...

09:32.000 --> 09:33.790
I'm sorry, you guys.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.500
The-- The Whispering Spell.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.790
No! Star! You get--
You get away!

09:40.790 --> 09:42.380
You run away from there!

09:42.380 --> 09:44.290
It's too late, Mom.

09:44.290 --> 09:46.920
So does this mean
that everything's
back to normal?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.290
It's not over yet.

09:48.290 --> 09:49.830
What do you mean
it's not--

10:01.830 --> 10:02.830
No!

10:02.830 --> 10:05.290
MARCO: Star!
Oh, no.

10:05.290 --> 10:07.790
Buffrog, we have to go now!

10:16.380 --> 10:18.710
Ludo! Where's Star?

10:20.920 --> 10:22.920
Where am I?

10:22.920 --> 10:25.500
Where is my daughter?
Mom! Mom, Mom!

10:25.500 --> 10:26.830
STAR'S VOICE:
I'm in here!

10:26.830 --> 10:28.880
Star

10:28.880 --> 10:30.500
Yes, it's me!

10:30.500 --> 10:32.250
Oh, thank goodness! Oh!

10:33.460 --> 10:34.460
Mom, stop it.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.710
Oh, Star!
Where are you?

10:37.710 --> 10:41.460
Well, I'm totally fine,
bu-but, ah,

10:41.460 --> 10:44.880
I don't exactly
know where I am.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.120
That's okay, sweetie.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.080
The important thing is,
you're safe.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.960
Just stay right there.

10:49.960 --> 10:53.580
And no matter wh--we'll
find you

10:53.580 --> 10:56.830
Mom

10:56.830 --> 10:58.540
Star?

10:58.540 --> 10:59.540
Are you still there?

10:59.540 --> 11:00.830
Mommy?

11:00.830 --> 11:02.540
Oh, what is happening?!

11:02.540 --> 11:03.960
Mom!

11:10.790 --> 11:13.380
Ohh, crazy eye, crazy eye,
crazy eye!

11:24.040 --> 11:26.330
Hello, Princess.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.220
Toffee?! Aha!

11:32.220 --> 11:36.310
I knew it! I knew it was you
all along!

11:36.310 --> 11:39.220
Wha-- Wait.
Is all this goop you?

11:40.270 --> 11:42.480
Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew.

11:42.480 --> 11:46.060
You don't even recognize
your own magic

11:46.060 --> 11:48.310
when you're swimming in it.

11:48.310 --> 11:50.220
This stuff is the magic?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.480
TOFFEE: It was.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.640
Until I got here.

11:57.390 --> 11:59.140
Oh, boy, that's not good.

11:59.140 --> 12:00.850
Mom! We've got a problem!

12:00.850 --> 12:03.270
TOFFEE: Only I can
speak to her now.

12:06.140 --> 12:08.100
TOFFEE'S VOICE:
Hello, Moon.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.720
Toffee.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.390
Give us back Star.

12:13.390 --> 12:14.980
Oh, of course.

12:14.980 --> 12:17.810
But I'd like
something from you first.

12:17.810 --> 12:21.020
Something that belongs to me.

12:27.350 --> 12:28.770
Take it.

12:28.770 --> 12:30.310
No, Mom, stop!

12:30.310 --> 12:33.520
I can take him!
Just hold on! Please!

12:41.640 --> 12:43.060
TOFFEE:
Poor little Butterfly.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.480
You've lost your wings.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.810
Now, Your Majesty...

12:47.810 --> 12:49.270
do we have a deal?

13:03.890 --> 13:05.220
Good-bye.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.350
No--No!

13:31.100 --> 13:32.430
Yeech.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.810
Where's my daughter?

13:37.810 --> 13:38.930
Where's Star?

13:45.980 --> 13:47.350
She's gone.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.600
Oh.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.560
I call the darkness onto me

14:11.560 --> 14:13.180
from deepest depths
of earth and sea.

14:13.180 --> 14:14.560
From ancient evils unawoken

14:14.560 --> 14:16.220
break the one
who can't be broken;

14:16.220 --> 14:17.520
From blackest night
I pledge my soul

14:17.520 --> 14:19.270
and crush my heart
to burning coal.

14:19.270 --> 14:20.600
To summon forth
the deadly power

14:20.600 --> 14:22.560
to see my hated foe devoured!

14:29.980 --> 14:31.890
Are you finished?

14:53.680 --> 14:56.350
Please...just tell me.

14:56.350 --> 15:00.850
Did I have
any part to play in this?

15:00.850 --> 15:02.720
No.

15:16.180 --> 15:17.350
Oh!

15:24.350 --> 15:28.220
Hmm. Come on. Come on.

15:30.480 --> 15:33.430
What are you doing?

16:05.480 --> 16:08.720
BUFFROG: Karate boy. Wake up.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.390
I think the Queen, uh,
needs...help.

16:12.390 --> 16:15.810
MOON: Come on, come on.
Why won't you fit?

16:15.810 --> 16:17.720
Come on.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.390
Queen?

16:19.390 --> 16:23.810
But maybe if I-I put the wand
back together, it'll--

16:23.810 --> 16:26.560
it'll--it'll bring her back.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.850
But this piece won't fit.

16:28.850 --> 16:31.390
MARCO: Here.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.720
Try this one.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.430
GLOSSARYCK: Hey, Star!

16:38.220 --> 16:40.480
Does this need, uh, salt?

16:42.310 --> 16:44.310
Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.
Hey--

16:44.310 --> 16:46.350
Oh, knock it off!

16:46.350 --> 16:48.100
More salt

16:48.100 --> 16:49.180
Bleeech!

16:49.180 --> 16:50.560
More salt.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.520
What is wrong with him?!

16:52.520 --> 16:54.310
What's going on here?
Where am I?

16:54.310 --> 16:55.850
I have no idea.

16:55.850 --> 16:57.480
No one's ever been here before.

16:57.480 --> 17:01.520
Oh, no. I'm dead. I'm dead.
I died!

17:01.520 --> 17:04.020
Well, if you're dead,
then I'm dead.

17:04.020 --> 17:05.680
And if you're calling me dead,
I find it--

17:05.680 --> 17:07.890
well, I find it
a little insulting, frankly.

17:07.890 --> 17:09.350
Oh, no.

17:09.350 --> 17:11.020
I am totally dead.

17:11.020 --> 17:13.600
And I'm stuck here.
With you.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.020
Uh Again.

17:15.020 --> 17:16.390
A little insulting.

17:16.390 --> 17:19.520
You betrayed me!

17:19.520 --> 17:22.480
I'm sorry it seemed that way.
Can we get beyond this?

17:22.480 --> 17:25.140
And just enjoy
our time here together

17:25.140 --> 17:27.100
in...wherever we are.

17:27.100 --> 17:30.310
Ha! You think
I'm gonna stay here with you,

17:30.310 --> 17:32.100
eat your dumb magic soup

17:32.100 --> 17:34.430
while Toffee is out there
doing who knows what!

17:34.430 --> 17:36.520
Star-
Marco and my mom
probably think I'm dead.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.930
Star.
Maybe I am dead.

17:38.930 --> 17:41.480
Star! Look at me.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.770
This is where we are now.

17:43.770 --> 17:45.520
And this soup
is not magic anymore,

17:45.520 --> 17:47.560
it's just...soup.

17:47.560 --> 17:50.220
So stop being foolish
and eat the soup.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.560
No.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.350
I get what you're doing.

17:59.350 --> 18:01.270
Mm

18:01.270 --> 18:03.060
This is just another one
of your games.

18:03.060 --> 18:06.350
You're going out of your way
to make me get to this
on my own.

18:06.350 --> 18:08.140
Oh, you didn't think
I'd catch on, Glossaryck,

18:08.140 --> 18:09.980
because you think I'm a skimmer.

18:09.980 --> 18:11.770
But am I dipper.

18:11.770 --> 18:13.060
Star, what are you doing?

18:13.060 --> 18:14.180
I'm getting us out of here.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.560
Star! No! It's boiling!

18:16.560 --> 18:19.060
Dip...dooown...

18:19.060 --> 18:20.810

ALL: Hi.

Huh?

make the plans--
I do! Me!

20:11.560 --> 20:15.520

this all turns out!

20:18.390 --> 20:21.520

Look what I did!

20:25.770 --> 20:27.100
All by myself!

20:27.100 --> 20:29.480
Oh, no! I can't see a thing.

20:29.480 --> 20:30.480
Ha ha!

20:30.480 --> 20:32.560
Do you think
he's really gone?

20:32.560 --> 20:34.390
Looks pretty gone
to me.

20:34.390 --> 20:35.980
Can't get more gone than that!

20:35.980 --> 20:37.980
Ohh!

20:37.980 --> 20:41.060
MARCO: Star, I've never seen you
do a spell like that before.

20:41.060 --> 20:42.520
STAR: Yeah, I'm not sure
what that was.

20:42.520 --> 20:44.100
Eclipsa.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.350
Okay, Princess,
I think we can both agree

20:46.350 --> 20:47.720
that I've got
some stuff to work on.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.310
You want me to
cut off the beard?

20:49.310 --> 20:50.430
No!

20:50.430 --> 20:52.100
Throw me back
in the void.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.480
I need to...find myself.

20:58.310 --> 20:59.720
I'm ready.

20:59.720 --> 21:03.020
Do you, uh,
need a minute with them?

21:03.020 --> 21:04.310
What, them?

21:06.020 --> 21:08.520
I'm sorry.
I have intimacy issues.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.770
Try to move on.

21:09.770 --> 21:10.930
Okay.
