WEBVTT

00:47.422 --> 00:50.050
The number one rule
in my family?

00:50.133 --> 00:52.927
Honor your parents.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.598
They're the supreme beings
who gave you life

00:56.765 --> 00:59.059
who sweated
and sacrificed so much

00:59.142 --> 01:01.352
to put a roof
over your head,

01:01.436 --> 01:02.604
food on your plate,

01:02.771 --> 01:05.190
an epic amount of food.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.525
The least you can do
in return is

01:07.692 --> 01:10.111
every single thing
they ask.

01:10.612 --> 01:14.032
'Course some people are like,
"Be careful.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.367
"Honoring your parents
sounds great,

01:16.451 --> 01:18.536
"but if you take it too far,

01:19.079 --> 01:21.998
"well, you might forget
to honor yourself."

01:23.917 --> 01:26.127
Luckily,
I don't have that problem.

01:28.671 --> 01:29.756
I'm Meilin Lee.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.134
And ever since I turned 13,
I've been doing my own thing.

01:33.301 --> 01:36.930
Making my own moves,
24/7, 365.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.599
I wear what I want,
say what I want

01:39.682 --> 01:41.267
and I will not
hesitate to do

01:41.351 --> 01:44.229
a spontaneous cartwheel
if I feel so moved.

01:44.854 --> 01:45.855
-Oh, crap!

01:48.066 --> 01:49.317
Not to brag,

01:49.400 --> 01:52.153
but being 13 means
I'm officially a grown-up.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.614
At least according to the
Toronto Transit Commission.

01:54.781 --> 01:55.782
Good for you.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.120
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.996
All about that hustle,
am I right?

02:19.514 --> 02:20.765
Besties, assemble!

02:20.849 --> 02:22.350
-Miriam!
-Hmm?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.144
Hey!

02:24.269 --> 02:26.146
-Priya!

02:28.231 --> 02:29.274
Yo.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.276
Abby!

02:33.236 --> 02:34.737
Yeah. What's up, Mei?

02:36.573 --> 02:38.408
-Ready to change the world?

02:38.575 --> 02:39.576
So ready.

02:39.742 --> 02:40.869
I was born to do this.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.787
Let's burn this place
to the ground!

02:43.371 --> 02:44.581
Y equals negative four.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.209
Manitoba,
Alberta, and Saskatchewan.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.254
I know, it's a lot...

02:52.714 --> 02:54.883
But this is grade eight.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.301
I don't got time
to mess around.

02:57.468 --> 02:58.803
I guess you could call me...

02:59.095 --> 03:03.933
A very enterprising,
mildly annoying young lady.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.643
A major weirdo.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.021
An overachieving dork-narc.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.482
I accept
and embrace all labels.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.071
-Oops.
-Hey!

03:17.155 --> 03:18.156
-Aah!
-Oh, you're dead!

03:18.323 --> 03:19.532
-Coming through!

03:19.699 --> 03:21.409
Move, please!

03:21.534 --> 03:23.036
Share the sidewalk, people!

03:23.661 --> 03:25.413
Anyway, who cares what stupid,

03:25.496 --> 03:27.165
evil Tyler
or anyone else thinks?

03:27.332 --> 03:28.541
This is gonna be my year.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.834
Mei, Mei, Mei,
come see this!

03:30.001 --> 03:32.337
And nothing's gonna stop
this train from...

03:32.420 --> 03:33.671
Shh. Come on, come on!

03:33.755 --> 03:34.964
-Get your butt over here!
-Go, go, go.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.383
Come on, come on.
Mei, Mei, fast!

03:37.550 --> 03:38.593
- Shut up!
- Shh!

03:41.846 --> 03:43.056
-Huh?
-Mmm-hmm!

03:43.223 --> 03:44.766
-Uh...
-Mmm.

03:44.891 --> 03:45.892
Devon.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.024
My mom cuts his hair
at the salon,

03:53.107 --> 03:54.859
and I felt it. It's very soft.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.444
Whoa. Can I have some?

03:56.611 --> 03:58.029
Yeah, Abby, hook a sister up.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.197
Ugh!

03:59.280 --> 04:00.782
He looks like a hobo.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.116
A hot hobo.

04:02.283 --> 04:05.203
May I remind you
what real men look like?

04:05.286 --> 04:07.038
4-Town!

04:07.205 --> 04:08.873
Yes! 4-Town!

04:10.375 --> 04:12.335
Jesse went to art school.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.672
-Tae Young fosters

04:15.755 --> 04:17.006
-injured doves.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.718
Robaire speaks French.

04:20.885 --> 04:21.886
Hey!

04:22.053 --> 04:23.638
And Aaron T. and Aaron Z.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.056
are, like,
really talented, too.

04:25.682 --> 04:30.144
We are 4-Townies, remember?
Ride or die!

04:35.900 --> 04:38.152
Yeah, but tickets
to 4-Town are, like,

04:38.236 --> 04:40.238
a bajillion dollars,
and Devon's right here.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.406
And free!

04:42.782 --> 04:44.659
Ah, fudgesicles! I gotta go.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.953
Wait! We're going
karaokeing today.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.121
-Yeah!
-Come with us.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.498
-Please.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.292
-Please.
-I...

04:52.917 --> 04:54.836
can't. It's cleaning day.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.839
Mei, every day
is cleaning day.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.424
Can't you just
get one afternoon off?

04:59.924 --> 05:01.801
But I like cleaning.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.177
Plus,
I got this new feather duster

05:03.261 --> 05:04.304
and, oh, my gosh, you guys,

05:04.470 --> 05:06.431
it picks up so much dirt,
it's bananas!

05:06.597 --> 05:08.224
Fine. I'll let you go.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.853
If you can pass the gauntlet.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.772
-Come on. Uh! Oh.
-Mir, not now...

05:14.939 --> 05:16.274
You can't resist it.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.400
Come on.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.860
-You know you want to.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.862
-Here we go.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.905
You're never not on my mind

05:23.072 --> 05:25.366
-Oh, my, oh, my
-Oh, yeah, oh, my

05:25.491 --> 05:27.243
I'm never not by your side,
your side

05:27.410 --> 05:28.411
Yeah.

05:28.661 --> 05:29.662
Your side

05:29.829 --> 05:30.913
- Peace sign.
- All right!

05:31.080 --> 05:32.415
-Yeah! Go, Mei!

05:32.582 --> 05:34.292
-See, that was good!
-That was dope!

05:34.459 --> 05:35.460
-You passed.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.462
-And here is your reward.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.629
Ninety-nine Australian tour,

05:38.713 --> 05:40.757
with the Girl I Love
Your Jeans remix.

05:40.923 --> 05:44.927
O-M-G, Mir!
I'll guard it with my life!

05:46.804 --> 05:48.139
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

05:48.222 --> 05:49.265
4-Town 4-ever!

05:49.432 --> 05:50.475
4-ever!

05:52.060 --> 05:54.062
We'll karaoke another time,
I promise!

05:54.228 --> 05:55.229
Okay, sure, Mei!

05:55.396 --> 05:57.815
It'll be on me.
The snacks, the tunes...

05:57.899 --> 05:59.817
-Whoo!
-You're my jam, girl.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.618
She's so brainwashed.

06:11.704 --> 06:12.705
Crud, crud, crud.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.583
Okay.

06:15.666 --> 06:16.667
Excuse me.

06:16.751 --> 06:17.960
-I know what it looks like.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.755
I am my own person.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.674
But that doesn't mean
doing whatever I want.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.093
-Hello, Meilin.
-Hey, how's it going?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.761
-Thank you, Meilin!

06:28.054 --> 06:31.599
Like most adults,
I have responsibilities.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.643
Hey, Bart. Hey, Lisa.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.814
-Hello, Meilin.
-'Sup?

06:37.980 --> 06:40.233
Still down for a rematch,
Mr. Gao?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.401
Bring it, Lee!

06:41.526 --> 06:44.821
-What a good girl.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.572
It's not all about me,
you know?

06:50.535 --> 06:53.496
I do make my own moves,
it's just that...

06:55.706 --> 07:00.128
...some of my moves
are also hers.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.838
Mei-Mei, there you are.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.297
-Hey, Mom...
-You're ten minutes late.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.133
What happened? Are you hurt?
Are you hungry?

07:05.216 --> 07:06.426
Um...

07:06.509 --> 07:07.593
How was school today?

07:08.219 --> 07:10.555
Killed it per usual.
Check it out.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.015
Oh. That's my little scholar.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.308
Today, honor student,

07:14.392 --> 07:16.769
tomorrow,
UN Secretary General.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.439
The ancestors
would be so proud.

07:31.075 --> 07:35.997
Sun Yee, revered ancestor,
guardian of the red pandas.

07:36.164 --> 07:39.542
We humbly thank you
for protecting and guiding us.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.335
Especially Mei-Mei.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.256
May we continue
to serve and honor you

07:45.339 --> 07:46.757
and this community.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.468
Always.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.280
-You ready?
-Let's do this.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.418
-Have fun

08:22.502 --> 08:23.794
-getting that off.

08:23.878 --> 08:24.879
Shoo-shoo! You vandals!

08:24.962 --> 08:26.005
Oh, snap!
They're coming!

08:26.172 --> 08:27.673
-You good-for-nothing hosers!
-Go, go, go!

08:27.840 --> 08:29.467
I'm telling your mothers!

08:29.884 --> 08:32.595
Our family runs
one of the oldest temples

08:32.678 --> 08:34.514
in Toronto.
And the most unique.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.934
Instead of honoring a god,
we honor our ancestors.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.727
And not just the dudes either.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.897
Our most revered ancestor,
Sun Yee,

08:42.980 --> 08:45.942
was a scholar, poet,
and defender of animals.

08:46.108 --> 08:49.111
She dedicated her life to
the creatures of the forest.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.280
Especially the red panda.

08:51.447 --> 08:52.448
-Ta-da!
-Ooh!

08:52.615 --> 08:54.325
Which she loved
for its fiery coat

08:54.408 --> 08:55.952
-and mischievous nature.

08:56.118 --> 08:59.247
Ever since, the red panda
has blessed our family

08:59.413 --> 09:01.249
with good fortune
and prosperity...

09:01.415 --> 09:04.085
-And it can bless yours, too!

09:08.589 --> 09:09.924
-Bye-bye!
-See you next time!

09:10.091 --> 09:11.300
Thanks for coming.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.765
-Give me five.
-Yeah.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.934
-Come on. Dad's making dinner.
-Ooh.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.874
Mmm.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.086
Huh? Uh...

09:55.636 --> 09:56.721
He should have listened

09:56.804 --> 09:58.014
to his mother
and married Ling-Yi.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.600
Totally.
Siu-Jyu is so two-faced.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.977
She's just using him
to get to the throne.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.937
She'll probably stab him
on their wedding night.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.105
Mmm-hmm.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.149
Hmm?

10:08.441 --> 10:10.026
Mmm. Hmm!

10:10.109 --> 10:11.235
-Perfect.
-Yes!

10:11.402 --> 10:12.403
You've heard their hits,

10:12.486 --> 10:13.571
you've seen their moves.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.823
And now, you get
to experience them live!

10:15.990 --> 10:17.867
The worldwide
pop sensation 4-Town

10:17.992 --> 10:20.077
will be kicking off
their North American tour!

10:20.244 --> 10:21.704
Tickets on sale now.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.247
Oh, my gosh!

10:23.414 --> 10:25.458
Who are these hip-hoppers?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.126
And why are they called
"4-Town"

10:27.209 --> 10:28.419
if there are five of them?

10:28.544 --> 10:30.296
Uh... I don't know.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.131
Some of the kids
at school like them.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.926
You mean Miriam?
That girl is odd.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.679
Dinner's ready.

10:41.140 --> 10:45.645
I've never met nobody like you

10:45.770 --> 10:48.272
You're never not on my mind

10:48.356 --> 10:50.441
-Oh my, oh my

10:50.524 --> 10:54.737
I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side

10:54.820 --> 10:59.367
I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry

10:59.492 --> 11:03.371
I'm gonna be your ride or die
All right

11:09.835 --> 11:13.631
Hmm. Kinda looks like Devon.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.510
I don't get
what Mir sees in him.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.095
He's not that cute.

11:20.137 --> 11:24.433
Okay, his shoulder's, like,
kind of nice, I guess.

11:24.767 --> 11:28.771
His eyes are... fine.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.481
-Mei-Mei.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.899
-Ow! Ah!

12:18.446 --> 12:19.447
Do you want a snack?

12:19.613 --> 12:20.906
Cool, great, thanks.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.158
Don't look at the notebook,

12:22.241 --> 12:23.367
don't look
at the notebook, don't!

12:25.119 --> 12:26.120
No!

12:28.038 --> 12:30.040
-Oh.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.459
-Is this your homework?
-Mom...

12:31.625 --> 12:33.461
-Don't!
-Oh, my. What... What is...

12:33.627 --> 12:34.837
-Do not.
-Huh? What?

12:35.045 --> 12:36.797
-Mom.
-Oh! Oh.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.008
Huh? Huh?

12:39.091 --> 12:40.176
Mei-Mei, what is this?

12:40.342 --> 12:41.927
It's nothing. Just a boy.
He's no one.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.304
-A boy?

12:43.512 --> 12:45.055
Who is he?
Did he do these things to you?

12:45.222 --> 12:47.725
-No! It's just made up, Mom!

12:48.684 --> 12:50.227
-It's not real.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.313
That hat.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.399
Is that the sketchy clerk
from the Daisy Mart?

12:55.483 --> 12:56.525
Mom, no!

12:58.903 --> 13:00.154
What are you doing?

13:02.656 --> 13:03.949
No, no, no!

13:04.158 --> 13:06.243
-No, no, no!

13:06.744 --> 13:08.245
Oh, snap!

13:09.580 --> 13:10.915
Mom, no!

13:11.081 --> 13:12.374
-You!
-Whoa!

13:12.458 --> 13:13.751
What have you done
to my Mei-Mei?

13:13.876 --> 13:15.169
Uh... Who?

13:15.336 --> 13:16.962
Meilin Lee, right here.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.007
I should report you
to the police.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.717
How old are you? Thirty?

13:21.926 --> 13:23.093
I'm seventeen.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.512
Oh, see, see?

13:24.595 --> 13:26.138
This is what happens
when you don't wear sunblock

13:26.305 --> 13:27.515
and do drugs all day!

13:27.681 --> 13:29.600
She's just a sweet,
innocent child.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.727
How dare you
take advantage of her!

13:31.894 --> 13:34.730
Mom! No!

13:38.067 --> 13:39.360
-What?

13:40.528 --> 13:42.154
What a weirdo.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.657
Look at her.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.999
The Daisy Mart has lost
a loyal customer today.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.675
Thank goodness I was here.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.135
That degenerate
won't come near you again.

14:06.303 --> 14:10.558
Now, is there anything else
I should know about, Mei-Mei?

14:11.016 --> 14:13.686
Nope. All good.

14:22.278 --> 14:25.114
You sicko!
What were you thinking?

14:25.281 --> 14:26.907
Why would you
draw those things?

14:26.991 --> 14:29.410
Those horrible, awful,
sexy things?

14:29.577 --> 14:31.620
It's fine.
You'll move to another city,

14:31.704 --> 14:32.746
change your identity.

14:34.164 --> 14:38.544
Mommy, I'm so sorry.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.299
You are her pride and joy,
so act like it!

14:51.557 --> 14:54.602
This will never happen again.

16:00.584 --> 16:01.669
No! No, no, no!

16:11.679 --> 16:12.680
Mei-Mei...

16:13.889 --> 16:14.974
are you up?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.228
Breakfast is ready!

16:19.603 --> 16:20.980
-Mmm.
-Hey! No sugar.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.401
Coming!

16:27.653 --> 16:30.572
-Mmm. Porridge.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.463
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.890
-Wake up, wake up, wake up!
-Mei-Mei,

16:56.974 --> 16:58.017
-is everything okay?

16:58.183 --> 16:59.601
-Don't come in here!

16:59.685 --> 17:02.271
Mei-Mei, what's going on,
honey? Are you sick?

17:02.438 --> 17:04.815
Is it a fever? A stomach ache?
Chills? Constipation?

17:04.982 --> 17:05.983
No!

17:06.150 --> 17:08.110
Wait. Is it...

17:08.277 --> 17:10.821
that? Did the...

17:11.739 --> 17:13.157
Did the red peony bloom?

17:13.323 --> 17:14.324
No!

17:15.075 --> 17:16.452
-Maybe?

17:16.535 --> 17:17.786
But it's too soon.

17:18.620 --> 17:21.248
Don't worry, Mei-Mei.
I'll get everything you need.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.624
Mommy's here.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.836
Jin. Jin! It's happening!

17:27.880 --> 17:29.840
Come on! Please!

17:31.300 --> 17:32.509
-Mei-Mei, I'm coming.
-Crud.

17:32.676 --> 17:33.844
-I'm coming.
-No!

17:34.970 --> 17:35.971
It's going to be okay.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.057
No, it's not!
Will you just get out?

17:39.892 --> 17:40.934
Excuse me?

17:41.518 --> 17:45.355
I didn't mean that.
I'm a gross red monster!

17:46.732 --> 17:48.275
Stop it! Stop talking!

17:51.779 --> 17:53.572
Mei-Mei,
I know this is upsetting,

17:53.655 --> 17:56.200
but we are going
to get through this together.

17:56.366 --> 18:00.788
I have ibuprofen, vitamin B,
a hot water bottle, and pads.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.123
Regular, overnight, scented,
unscented, thin, ultrathin...

18:03.290 --> 18:04.333
-Uh-huh. All right.
-...ultrathin with wings...

18:04.500 --> 18:06.126
Awesome.
Just leave them by the sink.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.170
Mei-Mei.
Perhaps we should talk

18:08.253 --> 18:09.505
about why this is happening.

18:09.671 --> 18:12.716
No! I mean, nah, it's okay.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.636
You are a woman now.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.012
And your body

18:17.096 --> 18:18.597
-is starting to change.
-Mmm-hmm.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.099
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.266
Mom, please!

18:21.433 --> 18:24.394
You are now a beautiful,
strong flower.

18:24.895 --> 18:25.896
No, no, no.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.564
Who must protect
your delicate petals

18:27.648 --> 18:29.441
and clean them regularly.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.194
-Ming? Ming!
-My porridge.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.987
-Jin. Jin!

18:34.071 --> 18:35.280
-Jin, open a window!

18:35.364 --> 18:36.365
Somebody call emergency!

18:40.369 --> 18:42.913
I'll just go to sleep,
and when I wake up...

18:43.080 --> 18:44.289
this will all be over.

18:55.926 --> 18:56.927
What the...

19:03.308 --> 19:04.434
Whoa.

19:14.778 --> 19:15.779
Yes!

19:17.447 --> 19:18.448
No!

19:20.534 --> 19:21.535
Oh.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.456
I'm calm.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.084
Zen.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.505
Yes.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.472
Okay. No biggie.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.100
You'll figure this out, Lee.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.060
Just be the calm,

19:47.227 --> 19:49.605
mature adult

19:49.771 --> 19:51.565
you totally are.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.859
You got this.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.539
I know it feels strange,
Mei-Mei,

20:07.706 --> 20:10.334
but I promise,
nobody will notice a thing.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.462
Thank you
for your concern, Mother.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.796
But I'll be fine.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.258
Well, here's your lunch.
I packed extra snacks.

20:18.425 --> 20:21.386
And herbal tea. For cramps.
It helps relax your...

20:21.553 --> 20:22.679
I got it. Thank you. Bye.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.202
Let's go, Beavers!
Let's go!

20:50.040 --> 20:51.041
Hey, Mei.

20:51.208 --> 20:54.169
Hey, girlfriends.
What is up?

20:55.671 --> 20:56.964
Uh, what's with the tuque?

20:57.047 --> 20:59.258
-Uh... Bad hair day.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.759
Did you, like,
work out this morning?

21:00.926 --> 21:02.094
I got you, girl.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.263
-Mei, we gotta talk.
-Okay.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.472
Tyler's been telling everyone

21:05.555 --> 21:06.848
-about the Daisy Mart.
-What?

21:07.015 --> 21:08.225
He said
your mom went nuts.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.351
And that you're
kind of a perv.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.852
I am not a...

21:12.521 --> 21:15.148
Tyler is an insecure jerkwad.

21:15.315 --> 21:16.525
Words were exchanged.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.111
Slightly uncomfortable secrets
were revealed.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.490
End of story...

21:33.834 --> 21:35.252
-Uh, Mei?

21:35.335 --> 21:37.004
Why are you staring
at Carter Murphy-Mayhew?

21:37.170 --> 21:38.505
I wasn't.

21:39.756 --> 21:40.924
-No!

21:42.092 --> 21:43.218
Tyler keeps putting these up.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.594
-Knock it off, butthead.

21:44.761 --> 21:45.887
Not funny, Tyler!

21:46.054 --> 21:48.724
Devon, my precious manly man.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.850
I banish you.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.435
-Literally go away!
-Begone!

21:51.518 --> 21:52.811
-I'm gonna kill him!

21:52.894 --> 21:54.021
What is wrong with you?

21:54.104 --> 21:55.188
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
You wanna do this?

21:55.355 --> 21:56.356
Leave her alone!

21:56.440 --> 21:57.691
You want
a piece of me, huh? Come here!

21:57.774 --> 21:58.900
Smell you later, dorks.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.777
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Get out of here, dude.

22:00.944 --> 22:02.237
Gotta go.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.655
-Uh, see you at lunch.
-Mei?

22:13.790 --> 22:14.791
What's with her?

22:14.958 --> 22:16.293
What's with your face?

22:16.626 --> 22:18.545
What is with you?
You're being weird.

22:18.712 --> 22:21.298
I'm just really excited
about math.

22:21.381 --> 22:22.883
-All right, guys.

22:23.383 --> 22:24.760
The quadratic formula.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.637
Let the fun begin.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.849
Who can tell me
how the formula begins?

22:30.932 --> 22:33.018
X equals...

22:34.269 --> 22:37.522
What a surprise, no one.
Okay, listen up.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.734
X equals negative B,
plus or minus,

22:40.901 --> 22:43.403
don't forget that plus
or minus, or I promise you,

22:43.570 --> 22:45.822
you will live to regret it.

22:52.996 --> 22:54.873
No. No. No.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.292
-Hi. Uh, ma'am?
-This isn't happening.

22:57.459 --> 23:00.087
-Hi!
-My child goes to this school.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.172
Why don't you come
to the front office?

23:02.255 --> 23:03.382
-I'm sure that someone can...
-Keep your...

23:03.507 --> 23:04.549
-Ow!

23:04.633 --> 23:05.717
I pay my taxes.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.094
Whoa, what is that?

23:07.677 --> 23:09.262
All right, all right,

23:09.346 --> 23:11.056
-settle down, little goblins.

23:11.139 --> 23:12.474
-Stop it!
-Whoa!

23:12.891 --> 23:13.892
Mei-Mei!

23:13.975 --> 23:16.311
-No. Please, no.
-Mei-Mei, help!

23:16.478 --> 23:18.397
Mei-Mei, tell him it's me!

23:19.981 --> 23:20.982
Mei-Mei!

23:21.149 --> 23:22.442
I will report you
for trespassing.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.693
Tell him it's Mommy!

23:25.195 --> 23:27.989
Mei-Mei!
Tell him you forgot your pads!

23:46.216 --> 23:47.217
Mei-Mei.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.428
Come back!

24:03.567 --> 24:05.444
O-M-G!

24:08.780 --> 24:11.408
Hey, I gotta go!
Open up!

24:17.873 --> 24:19.875
Mei-Mei! Stop!

24:22.252 --> 24:24.921
Jin. Jin, get home now.
There's been an emergency.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.131
Is it the woman thing?

24:26.214 --> 24:27.382
No! Another one.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.135
-It's so good.

24:30.218 --> 24:31.261
-Run!

24:31.344 --> 24:32.888
-It's a monster!

24:47.736 --> 24:48.987
Awooga!

24:49.070 --> 24:50.071
Huh?

25:07.130 --> 25:08.131
-Uh-oh.

25:22.395 --> 25:23.396
Mei-Mei.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.608
Mei-Mei.

25:27.275 --> 25:29.152
Gotta get home! Gotta hide!

25:35.033 --> 25:36.034
Mei-Mei.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.063
Mei-Mei.

26:08.525 --> 26:09.651
Mei-Mei!

26:12.821 --> 26:13.822
Oh!

26:14.614 --> 26:15.740
Mei-Mei!

26:19.244 --> 26:20.245
Mei-Mei?

26:21.997 --> 26:24.457
Don't look at me! Stay back!

26:25.542 --> 26:28.795
Sweetie,
it's okay. Mommy is here.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.547
What's happening to me?

26:32.007 --> 26:33.258
What is it? What... What...

26:33.383 --> 26:35.302
It's happened already?

26:40.432 --> 26:42.642
What did you say?

26:47.522 --> 26:48.523
Ming?

26:49.608 --> 26:50.609
It's time.

27:11.379 --> 27:15.050
As you know,
our ancestor, Sun Yee,

27:15.175 --> 27:18.053
had a mystical connection
with red pandas.

27:19.095 --> 27:22.265
In fact,
she loved them so much

27:22.432 --> 27:25.560
that she asked the gods
to turn her into one.

27:28.688 --> 27:31.816
It was wartime.
The men were all gone.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.278
Sun Yee
was desperate for a way

27:35.362 --> 27:37.530
to protect herself
and her daughters.

27:37.697 --> 27:40.575
Then one night,
during a red moon,

27:40.659 --> 27:42.911
the gods granted her wish.

27:43.078 --> 27:46.331
They gave her the ability
to harness her emotions

27:46.498 --> 27:50.126
to transform into a powerful,
mystical beast.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.338
She was able
to fend off bandits,

27:53.421 --> 27:54.547
protect her village,

27:54.714 --> 27:56.841
and save her family from ruin.

27:57.550 --> 28:00.178
Sun Yee passed this gift
to her daughters,

28:00.261 --> 28:02.055
for when they came of age.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.265
And they passed it to theirs.

28:04.432 --> 28:05.558
But over time,

28:05.642 --> 28:08.395
our family chose
to come to a new world.

28:08.561 --> 28:11.272
And what was a blessing
became...

28:11.439 --> 28:13.024
an inconvenience.

28:16.444 --> 28:19.406
Are you serious?

28:20.240 --> 28:21.491
-No!
-Mei-Mei, no!

28:21.658 --> 28:23.076
-It's a curse!
-She meant it as a blessing.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.078
You cursed us!
It's all your fault!

28:25.787 --> 28:27.956
Mei-Mei, stop!
Listen to me. Listen!

28:28.456 --> 28:29.541
There's a cure!

28:32.544 --> 28:35.213
Really? How do you know?

28:35.380 --> 28:38.049
Because it happened to me.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.177
Why didn't you warn me?

28:41.344 --> 28:43.346
I thought I had more time!

28:43.513 --> 28:44.681
You're just a child.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.516
I thought, if I watched you
like a hawk,

28:46.683 --> 28:49.477
I'd see the signs
and be able to prepare.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.772
But it's going to be fine.
I overcame it

28:52.939 --> 28:54.649
and you will too.

28:55.316 --> 28:56.901
On the next red moon,

28:57.068 --> 28:58.611
you'll undergo a ritual

28:58.695 --> 29:00.572
that will seal
your red panda spirit

29:01.030 --> 29:02.407
into one of these.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.160
And then
you'll be cured for good.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.203
Just like me.

29:07.912 --> 29:11.374
But any strong emotion
will release the panda.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.293
And the more you release it,

29:13.376 --> 29:16.504
the more difficult
the ritual will be.

29:16.671 --> 29:20.759
There is a darkness
to the panda, Mei-Mei.

29:21.342 --> 29:24.012
You only have
one chance to banish it,

29:24.095 --> 29:26.055
and you cannot fail.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.309
Otherwise,
you'll never be free.

29:30.226 --> 29:33.938
Let's see, the next red moon
will be the 25th.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.815
That's a whole month away.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.442
We'll wait it out together.

29:38.234 --> 29:41.571
And I'll be with you
every step of the way.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.290
Not bad.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.003
I saved Wilfred.

29:57.086 --> 29:58.505
Thanks, Dad.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.676
It's only temporary, Mei-Mei.

30:03.843 --> 30:08.223
This way, we won't worry about
any more accidents. Hmm?

30:13.812 --> 30:14.854
Sleep tight.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.945
Red is a lucky color.

30:38.586 --> 30:39.796
This is awful.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.131
What are we gonna do?

30:42.632 --> 30:44.592
Don't worry.
We'll get through this.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.595
No one
can see her like this.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.056
I never wanted this for her.

30:50.765 --> 30:53.685
Did you see
how she was in the temple?

30:54.769 --> 30:56.020
-Her eyes...

31:32.974 --> 31:33.975
Please...

31:35.810 --> 31:36.853
just...

31:38.771 --> 31:40.106
go away.

31:43.776 --> 31:44.777
No!

31:45.445 --> 31:47.447
Why? Why?

31:47.572 --> 31:48.615
-Mei, it's us.

31:48.698 --> 31:49.782
-Open up.
-Crud, no.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.910
Guys, what are you doing?
Go away!

31:52.076 --> 31:53.828
Are you okay?
Tap if you can hear us.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.288
One for yes, two for no!

31:55.455 --> 31:56.456
We were so worried.

31:56.539 --> 31:58.499
We thought
you died of embarrassment.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.376
You need more pads?
I brought extra.

32:00.543 --> 32:03.546
Forget that.
4-Town's coming to Toronto!

32:03.713 --> 32:05.632
-What?

32:06.090 --> 32:07.091
Hey!

32:07.258 --> 32:08.343
It's okay, everybody be quiet!

32:08.426 --> 32:09.427
Everybody, it's just me!
Shut up!

32:09.594 --> 32:10.678
-It's okay, it's me!

32:10.762 --> 32:12.889
It's Mei!
Calm down, all right?

32:13.056 --> 32:15.016
I'm gonna let go
and you're gonna be chill.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.100
-Got that?

32:16.517 --> 32:17.769
Mmm-hmm.

32:17.852 --> 32:18.937
Chill.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.356
Mei?

32:22.982 --> 32:23.983
Are you a werewolf?

32:24.150 --> 32:25.151
No! What?

32:25.318 --> 32:27.362
-She is a red panda!
-Sick.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.948
You're so fluffy!
You're so fluffy!

32:30.114 --> 32:32.784
-I've always wanted a tail.
-Priya, Abby, quit it.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.577
Mei, what the heck happened?

32:34.744 --> 32:39.457
It's just some, you know,
inconvenient, uh,

32:39.624 --> 32:42.585
genetic thingy
I got from my mom.

32:42.752 --> 32:45.880
I mean...
It'll go away.

32:46.047 --> 32:47.507
Eventually.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.133
Maybe.

32:52.804 --> 32:53.805
Aw, Mei.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.850
I hate this!
I'm slobby, I'm smelly.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.103
My mom won't even look at me,

33:00.269 --> 33:01.980
and now 4-Town?

33:02.855 --> 33:03.898
When are they coming?

33:04.065 --> 33:05.858
May 18th.
They just announced it.

33:06.025 --> 33:07.276
The 18th?

33:07.360 --> 33:10.279
There's no way
this will be gone by then.

33:10.446 --> 33:14.450
Just go.
Go become women without me.

33:14.951 --> 33:17.412
Mei. It's gonna be okay.

33:17.578 --> 33:21.207
No, it's not. I'm a freak.

33:21.499 --> 33:22.667
Just...

33:22.792 --> 33:24.127
Just leave me alone.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.977
Mmm. Yeah.

33:41.227 --> 33:43.021
Mmm. Let's go.

33:43.521 --> 33:44.605
Mmm.

33:44.689 --> 33:45.815
Yeah. Mmm.

33:45.898 --> 33:47.025
-Let's go.
-I've never met

33:47.108 --> 33:50.695
nobody like you

33:50.778 --> 33:53.865
Had friends
and I've had buddies

33:54.032 --> 33:55.199
It's true

33:55.366 --> 33:58.077
But they don't turn my tummy

33:58.244 --> 33:59.871
The way you do

34:00.038 --> 34:02.790
I've never met nobody

34:02.957 --> 34:04.167
Like you

34:07.545 --> 34:10.131
You're never not on my mind?

34:10.423 --> 34:12.467
Oh, my, oh, my

34:12.884 --> 34:17.388
I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side

34:17.555 --> 34:22.101
I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry

34:22.310 --> 34:25.313
I'll never not be your ride
or die

34:25.396 --> 34:26.564
All right!

34:26.731 --> 34:28.066
-Yeah! Whoo!
-Go, Mei!

34:28.232 --> 34:31.027
Thanks, guys.
You're the best.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.488
-Aw, we love you, Mei.
-You're our girl.

34:33.654 --> 34:36.908
Yeah. No matter what.
Panda or no panda.

34:41.454 --> 34:42.455
-Whoa.

34:42.538 --> 34:43.790
-Mei!
-You're you!

34:43.956 --> 34:45.666
And you look amazing!

34:45.833 --> 34:47.460
Red looks so good on you.

34:47.627 --> 34:48.628
Is it gone?

34:48.795 --> 34:51.297
For now.
But if I get too excited,

34:51.380 --> 34:52.840
it'll come right back... Ow!

34:52.924 --> 34:54.550
Abby, what the heck?

34:55.259 --> 34:56.427
Huh?

34:56.511 --> 34:59.222
Something feels different.

35:01.140 --> 35:02.475
Abby, hit me.

35:04.352 --> 35:05.812
Ow.

35:05.937 --> 35:06.979
Oh, my gosh!

35:07.146 --> 35:08.481
I stayed calm.

35:08.648 --> 35:12.527
Something about you guys,
like, neutralizes the panda.

35:12.652 --> 35:14.487
Aw! It's our love.

35:14.654 --> 35:15.947
We're like a warm
and fuzzy blanket.

35:16.030 --> 35:17.031
Yeah.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.867
This means
I can have my room back.

35:20.034 --> 35:22.453
I can
have my life back!

35:22.620 --> 35:24.914
No. Even better.

35:24.997 --> 35:26.541
You can come with us
to 4-Town!

35:26.707 --> 35:27.708
Yeah!

35:27.792 --> 35:30.044
This could be our only chance
to see them together.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.088
We're all asking
our parents tonight.

35:32.255 --> 35:33.339
We're making our stand.

35:33.422 --> 35:34.799
Yeah. You in or you out?

35:34.966 --> 35:39.637
But I can't ask my mom.
I'm a furry ticking time bomb!

35:39.804 --> 35:41.055
Of awesomeness!

35:41.222 --> 35:43.015
And now you can control it!

35:43.182 --> 35:46.769
So just prove it to her,
and she's gotta let you go!

35:48.020 --> 35:49.021
Mei-Mei?

35:49.188 --> 35:50.231
Crap! You guys better go.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.440
-But...
-No "buts," Mir.

35:51.607 --> 35:52.608
My mom
already doesn't like you.

35:52.775 --> 35:53.860
Wait, she doesn't?

35:54.026 --> 35:55.319
I'll call you, I promise.

35:55.486 --> 35:57.238
- We love you, Mei.
- Hang in there, girl.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.282
Everything okay?
I thought I heard...

35:59.448 --> 36:02.326
Mom, I think
I've made a breakthrough.

36:09.584 --> 36:10.585
Ready.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.295
Deforestation.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.506
Sad orangutan.

36:15.798 --> 36:16.966
Mmm!

36:17.300 --> 36:18.885
Your second place
spelling bee trophy.

36:23.681 --> 36:24.891
The important thing
is you tried.

36:25.057 --> 36:26.434
You spelled
your little butt off.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.311
First place in our hearts.

36:33.274 --> 36:35.818
What a shame.

37:02.136 --> 37:03.554
So cute!

37:05.014 --> 37:07.767
-No. So fuzzy.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.313
Must resist.

37:16.609 --> 37:17.610
We love you, girl.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.570
We love you, girl.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.364
Panda or no panda.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.748
How adorable.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.251
Mei.

37:33.417 --> 37:36.629
How is this possible?
What happened to your panda?

37:36.796 --> 37:39.257
It's easy.
When I start to get emotional,

37:39.423 --> 37:41.384
all I do is imagine the people

37:41.467 --> 37:42.718
I love most
in the whole world.

37:42.802 --> 37:43.886
Oh.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.889
-Which is you guys.
-Oh.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.849
Oh, Mei-Mei.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.979
So, now that that's settled,

37:53.145 --> 37:58.192
I just have one
teeny-tiny favor to ask.

37:58.859 --> 38:00.403
No. Absolutely not.

38:00.820 --> 38:03.239
What?

38:03.322 --> 38:04.699
But this is
once in a lifetime.

38:04.865 --> 38:07.618
Mei-Mei, it's one thing to
stay calm at home or school,

38:07.785 --> 38:08.828
but a concert?

38:08.995 --> 38:10.496
You'll get whipped up
into a frenzy

38:10.579 --> 38:11.664
and panda all over the place.

38:11.831 --> 38:14.250
I won't, I won't! I promise!

38:14.417 --> 38:15.584
You saw me keep it in.

38:15.751 --> 38:18.045
Ming, maybe
we should trust her.

38:18.212 --> 38:19.672
It's them I don't trust.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.340
Look at those
glittery delinquents

38:21.424 --> 38:23.467
with their...
gyrations.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.679
Why on earth
do you want to go so badly?

38:26.929 --> 38:28.639
-Chug! Chug! Chug!

38:33.602 --> 38:34.603
Like I said,

38:34.687 --> 38:37.398
I just want to broaden
my musical horizons.

38:37.523 --> 38:39.900
This isn't music.
This is filth.

38:40.067 --> 38:42.403
And it's not worth
jeopardizing your life over.

38:42.570 --> 38:43.779
-Right, Jin?
-Uh...

38:43.863 --> 38:46.991
See? Your father agrees.
No concert. And that's final.

38:50.870 --> 38:54.081
Okay, well, thanks
for listening. Good night.

39:03.632 --> 39:04.633
What was that?

39:04.800 --> 39:07.303
Am I the only one
who sees the danger here?

39:07.470 --> 39:09.513
There's no way
she could keep her panda in.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.099
And $200? For what?

39:12.266 --> 39:14.810
Who do they think they are?
Celine Dion?

39:16.145 --> 39:18.606
Hmm. Unbelievable.
I saw that look.

39:18.773 --> 39:19.982
Where did she get that from?

39:20.316 --> 39:21.734
Treating her own mother
like that.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.027
Hold on.
Ming, it's your mother.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.195
I'm not here!

39:28.240 --> 39:29.825
Mother. Hello.

39:29.992 --> 39:31.577
How's everything in Florida?

39:31.744 --> 39:34.789
Ming.
I know about Mei-Mei.

39:34.955 --> 39:36.582
I was just about
to call you,

39:36.749 --> 39:38.084
but everything's fine.

39:38.167 --> 39:40.294
I'm gonna handle
the ritual on my own.

39:40.503 --> 39:44.048
The way you "handled"
Mei-Mei being on the news?

39:44.799 --> 39:46.217
No one knows anything.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.760
They barely saw her.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.930
I'm on my way.
With reinforcements.

39:51.263 --> 39:52.890
-No! I can handle it. I can...

39:56.018 --> 39:57.103
-Run!

39:57.186 --> 39:58.896
Eyes on the balls, guys!

39:58.979 --> 40:00.439
-Be water! Be...

40:00.564 --> 40:03.317
That presentation
was bomb-dot-com.

40:03.484 --> 40:04.652
I cited all my sources.

40:04.819 --> 40:08.155
I had sparklers.
And she still said no!

40:08.322 --> 40:10.282
My parents said
I could go when I'm 30.

40:10.449 --> 40:11.909
Mine called it stripper music.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.536
What's wrong with that?

40:13.619 --> 40:15.704
Mine said yes,
but I have to buy the ticket.

40:15.871 --> 40:17.873
Who the heck's
got that kind of cash?

40:18.082 --> 40:22.711
I know my mom's worried,
but sometimes she's just so...

40:22.920 --> 40:25.172
-So...
-Wacko?

40:26.841 --> 40:28.843
Ma'am! Please!

40:29.009 --> 40:30.594
-I'm sorry, Mrs. Lee!

40:30.761 --> 40:32.138
-I see you!

40:32.471 --> 40:34.348
-Little momma's girl.

40:35.224 --> 40:38.018
No wonder Mei is such a loser.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.575
Illegal throw!
You're out, Lee.

40:52.741 --> 40:54.076
What? But, Mr. K, he...

40:54.243 --> 40:56.370
Mei, chill.
Let's go, let's go.

40:56.704 --> 40:57.913
Calm down, Mei.

40:59.498 --> 41:00.499
Dude, keep it together.

41:00.666 --> 41:03.502
I can't. We need
to see this concert.

41:03.669 --> 41:06.630
Why doesn't my mom get that?
I never ask for anything.

41:06.797 --> 41:08.507
My whole life
I've been her perfect

41:08.591 --> 41:10.926
little Mei-Mei.
Temple duties, grades...

41:11.093 --> 41:12.678
-Violin!
-Tap dancing.

41:12.845 --> 41:15.139
Yeah. We've been so good.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.600
If they don't trust us anyway,
then what's the point?

41:17.766 --> 41:19.477
Wow! Who are you?

41:19.643 --> 41:21.395
-I love it!
-Fight the power!

41:21.562 --> 41:23.772
Yeah. Yeah.

41:24.648 --> 41:27.067
This isn't just
our first concert.

41:27.234 --> 41:30.404
This is our first step
into womanhood.

41:30.738 --> 41:33.449
And we have to do it together.

41:33.616 --> 41:36.869
I'm in, girl. We'll say
it's a sleepover at my house.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.078
The perfect crime.

41:38.245 --> 41:40.581
Yes! My mom will never know.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.958
Now we just got to
raise the money for tickets.

41:43.125 --> 41:44.668
Come on, girls, think!

41:47.755 --> 41:49.507
Know what'll help me think?

41:49.673 --> 41:50.966
-A little panda.
-Abby...

41:51.133 --> 41:52.927
Come on, Mei.
It'll clear my mind.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.429
Just a little hit!
It's so cute!

41:55.554 --> 41:57.097
Ugh. Fine.

42:04.855 --> 42:06.065
Mon amour.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.361
Happy?

42:10.528 --> 42:12.321
Oh, yeah. That's the stuff.

42:12.488 --> 42:14.490
O-M-G.

42:14.615 --> 42:16.534
Aah! Go away!

42:16.700 --> 42:19.245
That was you in the bathroom!
I didn't imagine it!

42:19.411 --> 42:21.580
-Yeah, you did.
-Get lost, Stacy.

42:21.747 --> 42:23.874
But she's like a magical bear?

42:24.041 --> 42:25.042
Red panda!

42:28.462 --> 42:30.464
You are the cutest thing ever!

42:30.631 --> 42:31.715
Come out, please?

42:31.799 --> 42:32.967
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Please!

42:33.050 --> 42:35.386
Wait. So, you like the panda?

42:35.553 --> 42:37.137
Like it? I love it!

42:37.304 --> 42:38.889
I'll give you anything! Money?

42:39.056 --> 42:40.849
-My kidney!
-My soul.

42:41.016 --> 42:42.268
- Yeah!
- Adorable!

42:42.434 --> 42:43.644
-You're so cute!

42:46.981 --> 42:48.023
Is it on?

42:48.190 --> 42:50.192
-Let's go!
-Yeah, panda!

42:50.359 --> 42:52.611
-Fuel for domination.
-Money, money, money!

42:52.736 --> 42:53.779
Stop hogging
and give me some!

42:53.862 --> 42:54.863
Pass that over.

42:54.947 --> 42:56.657
-4-Town, here we come!

42:56.740 --> 42:59.326
Stop! That's so gross.
Do it again.

42:59.493 --> 43:00.828
All right, troops, listen up.

43:02.329 --> 43:04.665
Operation 4-Town Shake Down
is about to commence.

43:05.457 --> 43:07.960
The boys are coming
to the SkyDome May 18th.

43:08.127 --> 43:11.380
Our goal, four tickets.
That's 800 bucks!

43:11.547 --> 43:14.133
Step one,
neutralize the empress.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.594
Mathletes?
Isn't it a little dangerous

43:16.677 --> 43:18.178
to join an after-school
club now?

43:18.345 --> 43:20.598
What's dangerous
is an academic record

43:20.681 --> 43:22.683
with a lack
of extracurriculars.

43:22.808 --> 43:24.351
Hmm... Huh.

43:24.435 --> 43:27.104
Step two... Spread the word.

43:39.533 --> 43:40.618
And step three...

43:41.327 --> 43:43.412
hustle this panda
and squeeze

43:43.495 --> 43:44.747
every last loonie
outta those kids.

43:48.083 --> 43:50.753
And, baby, I did it on my own

43:50.919 --> 43:56.508
Did it on my own

43:56.800 --> 43:59.970
Own

44:00.179 --> 44:04.266
Did it on my own, yeah

44:08.646 --> 44:09.938
You know what's up

44:12.107 --> 44:14.276
You know it's us, yeah

44:14.443 --> 44:15.569
You ready?

44:15.986 --> 44:17.446
Here we go

44:18.489 --> 44:20.449
-You want it?
-I want it

44:20.616 --> 44:22.660
-You want it?
-I want it

44:22.826 --> 44:25.120
-You want it?
-I want it

44:25.788 --> 44:26.872
Louder

44:27.206 --> 44:29.041
-You want it?
-I want it

44:29.291 --> 44:31.251
-You want it?
-I want it

44:31.627 --> 44:33.587
-You want it?
-I want it

44:33.754 --> 44:36.048
Give me one, two, three, four

44:36.423 --> 44:40.469
You wanted it, you went for it
And, baby, you got it

44:40.761 --> 44:45.182
I wanted it, I went for it
And, baby, I did it on my own

44:48.143 --> 44:51.814
Did it on my own

44:53.440 --> 44:56.652
Own
Did it on my own

44:57.986 --> 44:59.738
-Let's go.
-Yeah!

45:05.577 --> 45:07.830
Did it on my...

45:09.039 --> 45:10.249
-Oh, no, it's falling!
-Grab it!

45:33.731 --> 45:35.816
Yeah, dude, let's go!
Push it, dude! Come on!

45:35.983 --> 45:37.568
Come on, new guy,
just keep on going!

45:42.281 --> 45:43.407
Come on, guys, keep going.

45:52.249 --> 45:56.086
Check out Number 12.
He's got delts for days.

45:56.253 --> 45:59.131
Forget that. I need lunch.
I'm starting to black out!

45:59.548 --> 46:01.175
I think I'm getting
carpal tunnel.

46:01.341 --> 46:02.634
No pain, no gain, Priya.

46:02.801 --> 46:04.052
Come on, chop-chop!
Five, 10...

46:04.219 --> 46:05.387
Girl, relax.

46:05.554 --> 46:06.930
Yeah. We're doing our best.

46:07.097 --> 46:08.265
It's not enough!

46:08.390 --> 46:09.600
The concert's this Saturday

46:09.683 --> 46:11.143
and we're still
a hundred short!

46:11.268 --> 46:12.811
I knew
we should have charged

46:12.895 --> 46:14.313
more for photos!
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

46:14.480 --> 46:16.940
Mei, breathe. It's in the bag.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.275
-But...

46:18.442 --> 46:20.152
What's the point
of getting to the concert

46:20.235 --> 46:21.945
if you're too exhausted
to enjoy it?

46:22.112 --> 46:25.282
Now, take a break and help me
appreciate some boys.

46:25.449 --> 46:26.950
Okay, okay, okay.

46:28.619 --> 46:29.745
Hey, what's up?

46:29.912 --> 46:31.413
- Mei!
- Hey, Mei, what up?

46:32.748 --> 46:33.874
-Looking good!
-Nice calves!

46:34.041 --> 46:37.127
Are you a triangle?
'Cause you acute!

46:38.462 --> 46:40.088
You guys are so weird.

46:40.964 --> 46:42.424
-Hey!
-Are you spying on us?

46:42.591 --> 46:43.759
I wanna talk to you, Lee.

46:43.842 --> 46:44.885
-Forget it.
-Fine.

46:45.052 --> 46:47.638
Wonder if your mom knows
her precious little Mei-Mei

46:47.805 --> 46:49.681
has been flaunting the panda
all over school.

46:53.685 --> 46:55.354
-That's none of your business!

46:55.687 --> 46:57.815
One more step and
I'm telling her everything.

46:58.732 --> 47:01.401
Now, put that thing away
and hear me out.

47:03.070 --> 47:04.279
What do you want?

47:05.906 --> 47:09.535
I wanna throw a sick
birthday party. An epic one.

47:12.913 --> 47:13.914
It's this Friday.

47:13.997 --> 47:15.707
If you're there,
everyone will come.

47:15.874 --> 47:17.209
Simple as that.

47:17.376 --> 47:18.544
A party?

47:19.795 --> 47:22.798
Look, I've done you a favor
keeping my mouth shut.

47:22.965 --> 47:24.842
All I'm asking for
is one back.

47:26.885 --> 47:27.886
Hmm.

47:28.387 --> 47:30.764
I'll do it.

47:30.931 --> 47:32.975
But it'll cost you one...

47:33.141 --> 47:34.685
No. Two hundred bucks.

47:34.810 --> 47:35.811
Okay.

47:36.395 --> 47:38.021
Uh, hold, please.

47:39.064 --> 47:41.149
Are you serious?
You can't trust him.

47:41.316 --> 47:42.317
It's a trap!

47:42.484 --> 47:44.069
This sounds like
a boy-girl party.

47:44.152 --> 47:45.362
Are we allowed
to boy-girl parties?

47:45.529 --> 47:48.782
Guys! Two hundred bucks
will put us over the top!

47:48.949 --> 47:50.492
We have to do this.

47:50.659 --> 47:52.619
We'll meet at Tyler's,
I'll do my thing,

47:52.703 --> 47:54.496
and then we'll bounce.
Easy-peasy.

47:54.663 --> 47:55.664
Dude, what about your mom?

47:55.789 --> 47:56.790
Forget my mom.

47:56.874 --> 47:58.667
I'll be back before
she even knows I'm gone.

47:58.834 --> 48:00.210
-But...
-Hey, dorkbag.

48:00.377 --> 48:03.130
We're in. But you only
get the panda for an hour.

48:03.297 --> 48:06.008
And we are not
bringing any presents.

48:06.174 --> 48:07.384
Deal.

48:16.310 --> 48:18.395
Okay, I'm heading off
to mathletes. See you later!

48:18.562 --> 48:21.899
Wait, what about dinner?
I made all your favorites.

48:23.650 --> 48:26.862
Thanks,
but Miriam's dad is, uh,

48:27.029 --> 48:28.655
ordering pizza.
Save me leftovers?

48:28.822 --> 48:30.282
-What if I come with you?
-Wha...

48:30.449 --> 48:32.492
What are you doing?
Linear equations? Geometry?

48:32.576 --> 48:33.619
I have a double-jointed elbow!

48:33.785 --> 48:35.245
Look! I can make
a perfect circle!

48:35.412 --> 48:39.291
Wow! Yeah, but it'll be
super boring.

48:39.458 --> 48:42.419
Wouldn't you
rather hang with Dad?

48:42.711 --> 48:43.712
Oh.

48:44.671 --> 48:45.672
Let's get my flashcards.

48:45.839 --> 48:46.840
-But...
-Hmm.

48:47.257 --> 48:48.258
I was mathletes champ

48:48.342 --> 48:49.384
-in grade 8, you know?
-Uh-huh.

48:49.551 --> 48:52.179
They called me
the "Uncommon Denominator."

48:52.346 --> 48:54.473
Cool. Oh, uh,
Jade Palace is on tonight.

48:54.640 --> 48:55.849
-Can't miss that, right?
-Now, who's the weak link?

48:55.933 --> 48:56.975
Priya and Abby
seem bright enough, but...

48:57.142 --> 48:58.143
Oh, and traffic's a nightmare.

48:58.226 --> 48:59.227
I can just
take the streetcar...

48:59.394 --> 49:00.395
-you stay and rest.
-Miriam...

49:00.562 --> 49:01.855
I mean, she's a nice girl,

49:01.939 --> 49:02.940
but maybe
she's slowing you down.

49:03.106 --> 49:04.900
Oh, Mom, you really
don't have to come.

49:05.067 --> 49:06.735
Don't be silly.
We're already on the way.

49:08.070 --> 49:09.404
But I don't want you to!

49:16.244 --> 49:17.996
Chop-chop, everyone.
Don't dawdle.

49:18.163 --> 49:19.164
-Hurry up.

49:34.221 --> 49:35.263
Oh! What...

49:35.889 --> 49:37.432
Hey, cuz! Surprise!

49:37.599 --> 49:39.726
Aunties?
What are you doing here?

49:39.893 --> 49:41.186
The ritual, silly.

49:41.353 --> 49:43.355
-She's lost weight.
-No, no, she gained weight.

49:43.522 --> 49:45.023
-She looks like her mother.
-She looks like her father.

49:45.190 --> 49:46.191
Ladies.

49:51.071 --> 49:52.072
Mother.

49:53.907 --> 49:54.908
Hey, Grandma.

49:55.075 --> 49:56.076
Poor dear.

49:56.243 --> 49:57.995
It must be so difficult

49:58.078 --> 50:01.081
keeping that
unruly beast at bay.

50:01.623 --> 50:04.126
Your family is here now,
Mei-Mei.

50:04.584 --> 50:07.004
And we will take care
of everything.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.341
Everybody clap your hands

50:12.092 --> 50:13.844
Clap, clap, clap,
clap your hands

50:15.012 --> 50:17.723
All right, now, we gonna do
the basic step...

50:17.806 --> 50:19.474
Where is she?

50:21.018 --> 50:22.644
Who's up for some Boggle?

50:23.729 --> 50:26.898
Eat. You need
your strength for the ritual.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.567
-Thank you, aunties.

50:28.734 --> 50:30.861
Your hair is so thick,
like a pelt.

50:31.028 --> 50:33.947
What a surprise
that you all came so early.

50:34.114 --> 50:36.533
You need all the help
you can get, Ming.

50:37.075 --> 50:39.327
So, Mei-Mei,
you've been managing

50:39.411 --> 50:40.537
to keep the panda in?

50:41.079 --> 50:43.457
-Yep. Totally.
-Really?

50:43.623 --> 50:44.624
What's that, Lily?

50:44.791 --> 50:47.085
Well, it's a little hard
to believe

50:47.169 --> 50:49.671
that Mei-Mei
could control such a beast.

50:49.838 --> 50:51.006
She's just a child.

50:51.173 --> 50:53.216
It's true.
And if Mei-Mei's panda

50:53.300 --> 50:55.594
-is anything like Ming's...

50:55.677 --> 50:56.845
Mei-Mei's better
than any of us

50:56.928 --> 50:58.096
at controlling the panda.

50:58.263 --> 51:02.017
She passed every trigger test.
Even the kitten box.

51:02.184 --> 51:03.185
- Oh!
- Oh, my goodness!

51:03.268 --> 51:04.311
-That's unbelievable.
-Impressive.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.605
She just thinks
of my love for her,

51:06.688 --> 51:08.940
and it gives her the strength
to stay calm.

51:09.816 --> 51:11.109
Exactly.

51:11.276 --> 51:12.778
-Aw.
-How sweet.

51:12.861 --> 51:14.071
-How sweet.

51:14.196 --> 51:16.406
Anyway,
thanks for all the gifts,

51:16.490 --> 51:18.450
but I think I'll go
to bed early.

51:18.617 --> 51:19.951
Keeping that animal
locked down

51:20.035 --> 51:21.536
sure takes a lot of energy.

51:21.703 --> 51:23.246
Okay, sweetie. Get some rest.

51:23.330 --> 51:24.331
Night, everyone.

51:24.456 --> 51:25.457
-Good night, Mei-Mei.
-Sleep well.

51:25.540 --> 51:26.583
- Get some beauty rest.
- Get some rest.

51:34.674 --> 51:35.675
Oh!

51:40.430 --> 51:42.599
Mei-Mei, can I have a word
with you?

51:43.183 --> 51:45.018
Uh, sure. What's up?

51:47.771 --> 51:49.189
I found this.

51:49.898 --> 51:53.401
Strange for a girl
who hasn't let her panda out.

51:53.527 --> 51:54.653
It's, uh...

51:55.237 --> 51:56.363
It's not mine.

51:56.446 --> 51:59.407
Mei-Mei,
I know what you're doing.

51:59.574 --> 52:02.744
I know how hard it is
to keep the beast in.

52:02.911 --> 52:06.414
It feels so good
to let it out. So free.

52:07.249 --> 52:11.503
But each time you do,
the stronger it gets.

52:12.003 --> 52:14.214
And then you'll be
bound to it forever,

52:14.297 --> 52:16.716
and the ritual will fail.

52:17.634 --> 52:19.845
Has that ever happened?

52:20.011 --> 52:22.264
It cannot happen.

52:25.016 --> 52:28.854
Your mother and I
were close once,

52:29.020 --> 52:32.399
but the red panda
took that away.

52:33.358 --> 52:36.486
I couldn't bear to see
that happen to you.

52:37.487 --> 52:39.865
So, no more panda.

52:42.617 --> 52:45.912
You are your mother's
whole world, Mei-Mei.

52:46.079 --> 52:48.915
I know you'll do what's right.

52:52.043 --> 52:53.670
Uh-uh. Mmm. Mmm!

52:53.837 --> 52:55.463
-Uh, worm.
-Uh... Octopus!

52:55.630 --> 52:57.549
-Spaghetti?
-Killer robot!

52:57.716 --> 52:58.925
Mortality.

52:59.176 --> 53:00.427
Hmm. Nice.

53:00.552 --> 53:01.970
-This sucks.

53:02.053 --> 53:03.930
-Let's bail.
-Just wait. She'll be here.

53:04.097 --> 53:05.390
-I knew she'd flake.

53:05.473 --> 53:06.474
-Panda girl!

53:06.600 --> 53:08.476
- It's Mei!
- Thank Cthulhu.

53:08.602 --> 53:10.437
-Ugh. About time.

53:14.524 --> 53:17.068
Yo! What up, peeps?

53:17.152 --> 53:18.278
What are you wearing?

53:18.445 --> 53:20.780
Hey, Tyler. Happy birthday.

53:21.239 --> 53:25.869
I'm paying for the red panda,
not this garbage! Deal's off!

53:26.036 --> 53:28.914
Wait! Can garbage do this?
Uh-huh.

53:28.997 --> 53:30.832
Or this? Stir the porridge.

53:30.999 --> 53:33.919
Come on, guys!
Stir the porridge.

53:35.128 --> 53:37.130
Are you feeling okay?

53:37.255 --> 53:39.633
Guys, it's hard
to explain, but just, hmm...

53:39.799 --> 53:40.967
Just trust me on this.

53:41.051 --> 53:42.761
I can't panda anymore.
I'm sorry.

53:42.928 --> 53:45.096
Okay, okay, okay. It's fine.

53:45.263 --> 53:46.473
You don't have to do it.

53:46.556 --> 53:47.974
We'll just, uh,
figure something...

53:48.141 --> 53:49.267
I won't go.

53:49.351 --> 53:51.853
What? Priya, you can't not go.

53:52.020 --> 53:53.647
Jesse's your soul mate.

53:53.813 --> 53:54.814
But we only have enough

53:54.940 --> 53:56.441
-for three tickets.
-Then I'll stay home.

53:56.608 --> 53:58.526
Abby, no! I'll stay home.

53:58.693 --> 54:01.029
Guys, if we can't all go,

54:01.196 --> 54:03.198
then none of us should go.

54:03.740 --> 54:04.741
Right?

54:17.629 --> 54:19.506
Just one last time.

54:20.090 --> 54:21.132
Hey, Tyler!

54:21.299 --> 54:23.718
You want the panda?
You're getting the panda.

54:24.678 --> 54:26.721
Let's hear it
for the birthday boy!

54:30.016 --> 54:31.017
Yes!

54:34.104 --> 54:36.147
Go, Tyler! Go, Tyler!

54:36.314 --> 54:37.983
-Go, go, go, Tyler!
-Yeah!

54:38.149 --> 54:39.150
Okay!

54:49.369 --> 54:50.704
Yeah! Get it, girl!

54:53.832 --> 54:55.917
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

54:56.084 --> 54:57.919
-Oh, yeah!

55:00.130 --> 55:02.549
Faster! Faster! Whoo!

55:02.632 --> 55:04.676
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

55:04.843 --> 55:06.803
Yeah!

55:08.138 --> 55:09.222
You sure
the hotel's all right?

55:09.389 --> 55:11.141
It'll do.
At least breakfast is free.

55:11.308 --> 55:13.184
Get some rest. You look tired.

55:13.351 --> 55:14.561
Good night, cuz.
Try that tea.

55:14.728 --> 55:16.730
-Good night, Ming.
-Good night.

55:19.065 --> 55:21.735
Ming, this is a critical time.

55:21.901 --> 55:25.822
Mei-Mei needs a strong hand,
now more than ever.

55:25.989 --> 55:28.700
Don't let her
out of your sight.

55:28.867 --> 55:30.118
I won't, Mother.

55:52.474 --> 55:54.559
-Hmm. Oh.

55:58.772 --> 55:59.773
-Oh.

56:00.440 --> 56:01.441
Oh, no.

56:06.071 --> 56:08.490
"Fur baby"?

56:08.573 --> 56:09.741
Oh!

56:10.617 --> 56:11.618
What?

56:19.334 --> 56:20.335
What...

56:22.670 --> 56:24.381
Mei-Mei. What is all...

56:31.388 --> 56:34.140
Yeah! We did it!
We are seeing 4-Town!

56:34.307 --> 56:35.308
- Whoo!
- Yes.

56:36.476 --> 56:38.520
Hey,
has anyone seen Mei?

56:41.689 --> 56:43.983
Dang. He is working you.

56:44.109 --> 56:45.402
What a diva!

56:45.735 --> 56:47.570
It'll all be worth it.

56:51.366 --> 56:54.911
Tomorrow, we are walking
into that concert girls

56:55.078 --> 56:57.956
and coming out women.

56:58.665 --> 57:00.375
Literally goosebumps.

57:00.500 --> 57:03.086
Hmm. What do you think
Jesse smells like?

57:04.421 --> 57:05.713
Milk chocolate and wet rocks.

57:05.880 --> 57:06.881
-Wow!

57:07.048 --> 57:08.049
-So manly.

57:08.133 --> 57:09.134
Oh, yes!

57:09.384 --> 57:11.094
It's happening,
Robaire Junior!

57:11.177 --> 57:12.679
You're finally gonna
meet your daddy!

57:12.846 --> 57:14.389
And your hot uncles!

57:15.849 --> 57:17.016
What? It's true.

57:19.269 --> 57:22.480
Mei, what if you
didn't do the ritual?

57:23.231 --> 57:25.108
What if you kept the panda?

57:25.275 --> 57:27.110
-What?
-Look at you!

57:27.277 --> 57:28.862
You're not the same
feather-dustin',

57:28.945 --> 57:29.946
straight-A, goody-goody...

57:30.113 --> 57:31.614
Who we never saw, like, ever.

57:31.781 --> 57:33.575
-Yeah.
-You're such a rebel now.

57:33.741 --> 57:36.244
Guys, I can't be
like this forever.

57:36.411 --> 57:38.246
My whole family would freak.

57:38.413 --> 57:40.206
Especially my mom.

57:41.583 --> 57:44.085
All her hopes and dreams
are pinned on me.

57:44.252 --> 57:47.255
I know.
But you've really changed

57:47.964 --> 57:49.215
and I'm proud of you.

57:49.716 --> 57:52.635
Just don't get rid
of all of it, you know?

57:52.802 --> 57:54.220
Yeah. If it weren't for you,

57:54.304 --> 57:55.722
none of this
would be happening.

57:55.889 --> 57:58.266
-You the bomb!
-Word. You da bomb, Mei.

57:58.433 --> 57:59.642
No, you da bomb.

57:59.809 --> 58:00.852
We all da bomb!

58:01.019 --> 58:03.396
-Yes. Yes. Yes!

58:03.563 --> 58:04.647
We da bomb!

58:04.731 --> 58:06.441
- 4-Town, here we come!
- Robaire, I love you!

58:06.608 --> 58:08.651
We're coming for you!
We are women!

58:08.818 --> 58:10.487
- We are women!
- We are hot!

58:12.822 --> 58:14.032
All right,
homies, next up is 4-Town.

58:14.199 --> 58:16.868
The boys are coming
to Toronto on the 25th!

58:16.951 --> 58:18.453
So get your tickets now.

58:18.620 --> 58:20.747
And check it, they'll be
cranking open the SkyDome

58:20.914 --> 58:22.373
and performing under
a red lunar eclipse.

58:22.457 --> 58:23.500
It's gonna be galactic,
for sure.

58:23.666 --> 58:24.834
Abby...

58:25.376 --> 58:28.505
you said the concert
was the 18th.

58:28.671 --> 58:32.425
It is! He's wrong!
Look! The 18th, Toronto!

58:33.176 --> 58:34.177
Uh...

58:34.302 --> 58:35.512
This says Toledo.

58:35.637 --> 58:36.638
What?

58:40.350 --> 58:42.644
Toledo?

58:42.769 --> 58:43.853
What the heck is Toledo?

58:44.020 --> 58:45.271
-Oh, no.
-What?

58:45.438 --> 58:47.440
4-Town's the same night
as the ritual?

58:47.607 --> 58:48.691
No!

58:48.858 --> 58:49.984
The same night?

58:50.527 --> 58:52.737
The same night? What?

58:52.904 --> 58:54.489
-Mei, chill.
-It's okay.

58:54.656 --> 58:56.032
No, it isn't!

58:56.199 --> 58:59.619
I can't miss 4-Town!
We worked so hard!

59:00.745 --> 59:03.206
But the ritual.
I'll let everyone down!

59:03.373 --> 59:06.000
-No, no, no!
-Hey, Panda Girl.

59:07.502 --> 59:09.879
What are you doing?
We want more rides.

59:10.046 --> 59:11.839
Buzz off, jerkface. I'm busy.

59:12.257 --> 59:13.258
Oh, snap!

59:13.424 --> 59:14.759
You gonna take that, Tyler?

59:14.926 --> 59:16.219
You want your money?

59:16.302 --> 59:17.971
Then get your butt
down here now!

59:18.137 --> 59:19.973
Forget your money,
and forget you!

59:20.139 --> 59:21.516
Mei! Let's just go.

59:21.641 --> 59:22.642
-What about our deal?

59:22.809 --> 59:23.810
Shove your deal!

59:23.935 --> 59:25.436
Fine! Get out of here!

59:25.603 --> 59:27.355
Go back to your psycho mom

59:27.438 --> 59:29.774
and your creepy temple,
you freak!

59:29.899 --> 59:31.901
-Mei, no!

59:32.026 --> 59:33.987
-Take it back!

59:34.153 --> 59:35.154
Don't talk about my family
like that!

59:35.321 --> 59:36.322
-You're hurting him!
-Mei!

59:36.489 --> 59:38.032
-Mei-Mei, stop!
-I hate you! I hate...

59:38.199 --> 59:40.076
What is going on here?

59:42.328 --> 59:43.746
I'm sorry.

59:43.913 --> 59:46.749
Just get off of me. Please.

59:53.506 --> 59:54.757
TYLER'
I cannot believe

59:54.841 --> 59:55.842
you would
let your daughter do this!

59:56.009 --> 59:57.552
TYLER'Do you understand
what she did to my boy?

59:57.719 --> 59:58.803
I am so sorry.

59:59.012 --> 1:00:01.306
She's never done
anything like this before.

1:00:01.472 --> 1:00:02.557
I don't know
what came over her.

1:00:02.724 --> 1:00:04.434
I don't want to hear
your apologies, okay?

1:00:04.517 --> 1:00:06.644
-I'm sorry again.
-She is an animal!

1:00:06.811 --> 1:00:09.772
All right, party's over!
Everyone, go home!

1:00:23.286 --> 1:00:25.371
I can't believe you girls
would use her like this!

1:00:25.538 --> 1:00:26.539
-What?
-But we didn't.

1:00:26.623 --> 1:00:27.624
No, we'd never.

1:00:27.790 --> 1:00:29.709
-What?
-I knew you were trouble.

1:00:29.876 --> 1:00:30.877
Putting all these thoughts

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:33.171
into Mei-Mei's head,
parading her around.

1:00:33.338 --> 1:00:35.506
Now she's lying, sneaking out.

1:00:35.673 --> 1:00:38.051
She attacked
a defenseless boy.

1:00:38.343 --> 1:00:39.761
You think this is a joke?

1:00:39.844 --> 1:00:41.596
Do you know
how dangerous this is?

1:00:41.763 --> 1:00:45.099
We didn't mean to,
we just wanted to see 4-Town.

1:00:45.266 --> 1:00:47.727
4-Town! You manipulated her

1:00:47.810 --> 1:00:49.395
for a bunch
of tacky delinquents?

1:00:49.562 --> 1:00:51.856
-No! She wanted to...
-Don't you blame her.

1:00:52.023 --> 1:00:53.441
She is a good girl,

1:00:53.524 --> 1:00:55.068
and you've taken
advantage of her.

1:00:55.443 --> 1:00:56.778
Mei, tell her.

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:06.287
-What?
-Dude!

1:01:08.331 --> 1:01:09.415
Come on, Mei-Mei.

1:01:10.416 --> 1:01:11.417
Let's go.

1:01:58.798 --> 1:02:00.258
Will call that way.

1:02:02.009 --> 1:02:04.095
All righty,
general admission, eh?

1:02:04.178 --> 1:02:05.304
How many tickets?

1:02:08.349 --> 1:02:09.350
Three, please.

1:02:12.437 --> 1:02:14.272
What is that?

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:17.442
Um, I think it's coming
from the SkyDome, Mother.

1:02:17.567 --> 1:02:19.569
Four is the worst number.

1:02:19.736 --> 1:02:21.487
You know,
Vivian was due on the fourth,

1:02:21.571 --> 1:02:23.030
but I held her
in until the fifth...

1:02:23.197 --> 1:02:24.198
Quiet, Lily.

1:02:24.282 --> 1:02:25.283
Hurry up, everyone.

1:02:25.408 --> 1:02:27.285
It's almost time
to start the ritual.

1:02:27.452 --> 1:02:28.745
Nervous, Mei-Mei?

1:02:28.911 --> 1:02:30.621
-A little.
-Oh, well,

1:02:30.705 --> 1:02:34.751
I've got 50 years' experience
as a shaman.

1:02:34.876 --> 1:02:37.128
This will be a piece of cake.

1:02:37.837 --> 1:02:39.756
And mostly painless.

1:02:39.881 --> 1:02:41.883
Thanks, Mr. Gao.

1:02:42.049 --> 1:02:43.217
Wait, "mostly"?

1:02:45.052 --> 1:02:48.306
Long ago, the spirits
blessed the women

1:02:48.389 --> 1:02:51.350
of our family
with a great challenge.

1:02:51.517 --> 1:02:54.103
Mei-Mei, tonight is your turn.

1:02:54.729 --> 1:02:56.731
Like all the women
around this table,

1:02:56.898 --> 1:02:59.525
you too will banish
the beast within

1:02:59.692 --> 1:03:02.612
and finally become
your true self.

1:03:02.779 --> 1:03:06.449
May Sun Yee guide you
and keep you safe.

1:03:06.616 --> 1:03:07.658
- Hear, hear!
- That's right.

1:03:07.742 --> 1:03:08.743
Don't blow it.

1:03:09.994 --> 1:03:13.331
Uh... It's almost time.

1:03:13.498 --> 1:03:15.708
The red moon
is about to begin.

1:03:16.167 --> 1:03:17.585
Mei-Mei, go get ready.

1:03:17.752 --> 1:03:18.961
Yes, Mother.

1:03:19.504 --> 1:03:21.422
MR.
Oh, where are the instruments?

1:03:22.924 --> 1:03:23.925
It's so amazing!

1:03:26.719 --> 1:03:28.346
-Hmm. Huh?
-Jin!

1:03:28.429 --> 1:03:29.806
-Help clear the table!
-Uh-huh.

1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:35.561
Uh...

1:03:36.437 --> 1:03:37.647
Oh!

1:03:38.439 --> 1:03:39.440
Is it on?

1:03:40.608 --> 1:03:42.109
4-Town, here we come!

1:03:42.193 --> 1:03:43.319
-Huh.

1:03:43.486 --> 1:03:44.570
That's so gross.

1:03:45.112 --> 1:03:46.113
Hmm.

1:03:49.450 --> 1:03:51.410
Did it on my own

1:04:00.586 --> 1:04:01.587
I hate you!

1:04:07.426 --> 1:04:08.469
Come in.

1:04:09.220 --> 1:04:10.221
Hey, Dad.

1:04:10.888 --> 1:04:12.139
I... I'm almost ready.

1:04:12.306 --> 1:04:13.599
Did you make this?

1:04:16.102 --> 1:04:17.395
Here, I'll erase it.

1:04:18.604 --> 1:04:21.148
What? We were
just being stupid.

1:04:22.900 --> 1:04:26.070
The panda's dangerous,
outta control.

1:04:27.154 --> 1:04:29.824
Huh. You sound
like your mother.

1:04:30.783 --> 1:04:33.703
What has she told you
about her panda?

1:04:33.828 --> 1:04:37.290
Nothing.
She won't talk about it.

1:04:37.456 --> 1:04:40.334
It was quite destructive.

1:04:40.418 --> 1:04:42.670
And big.

1:04:43.796 --> 1:04:45.965
She almost took out
half the temple.

1:04:46.132 --> 1:04:47.842
You... You saw it?

1:04:48.134 --> 1:04:49.302
Only once.

1:04:49.468 --> 1:04:52.013
She and your grandma
had a terrible fight.

1:04:52.179 --> 1:04:53.764
Over what?

1:04:56.517 --> 1:04:59.562
Your grandma
didn't approve of me.

1:05:00.146 --> 1:05:02.064
But you should've seen
your mom.

1:05:02.231 --> 1:05:05.443
She was incredible.

1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:09.906
But I'm a monster.

1:05:12.033 --> 1:05:15.202
People have all kinds
of sides to them, Mei.

1:05:15.703 --> 1:05:18.873
And some sides are messy.

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:23.502
The point isn't to push
the bad stuff away,

1:05:24.587 --> 1:05:27.632
it's to make room for it,
live with it.

1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:33.554
Mei, erase it if you want,
but this side of you...

1:05:35.389 --> 1:05:36.474
made me laugh.

1:05:39.810 --> 1:05:41.646
-Dude, you're crazy!

1:05:43.064 --> 1:05:44.106
Come here!

1:05:46.150 --> 1:05:47.151
Mei-Mei.

1:05:49.403 --> 1:05:50.404
It's time.

1:06:01.207 --> 1:06:04.543
Just follow my directions
and breathe.

1:06:11.592 --> 1:06:14.095
Now don't move
from the circle.

1:06:14.178 --> 1:06:15.388
You understand?

1:06:15.554 --> 1:06:17.682
For as long
as the red moon shines,

1:06:18.265 --> 1:06:20.893
the astral realm will be open.

1:06:21.894 --> 1:06:23.938
And this circle is the door.

1:06:40.162 --> 1:06:41.247
What are they saying?

1:06:41.414 --> 1:06:45.543
The door will open only if we
sing from our hearts.

1:06:45.710 --> 1:06:49.255
It doesn't matter what.
I like Tony Bennett,

1:06:49.422 --> 1:06:52.633
but your grandma, uh,
she's from old school.

1:06:53.259 --> 1:06:56.178
Now, focus on their voices.

1:06:56.345 --> 1:06:58.347
Let them guide you.

1:07:04.061 --> 1:07:06.939
Oh, Sun Yee, revered ancestor,

1:07:07.356 --> 1:07:08.691
hear us now.

1:07:14.071 --> 1:07:17.074
MR.Guide this girl
through her inner storm.

1:07:25.291 --> 1:07:26.625
Louder! Louder!

1:07:34.091 --> 1:07:37.136
And return
the red panda spirit

1:07:37.303 --> 1:07:38.679
from where it came!

1:08:16.967 --> 1:08:18.636
Sun Yee.

1:09:16.026 --> 1:09:17.862
You can do it. Keep going!

1:09:37.590 --> 1:09:38.632
No!

1:09:51.228 --> 1:09:52.396
What happened?

1:09:52.479 --> 1:09:53.689
-What was that?
-Mei-Mei...

1:09:53.772 --> 1:09:54.773
-Is everyone okay?

1:09:54.899 --> 1:09:55.941
Oh, my goodness,
I can't...

1:09:56.025 --> 1:09:57.026
Mei-Mei.

1:09:57.693 --> 1:09:59.403
It's okay. We can do it again.

1:10:00.905 --> 1:10:01.906
Mei-Mei?

1:10:03.157 --> 1:10:04.158
I'm keeping it.

1:10:04.325 --> 1:10:05.492
-What did she say?
-Keeping it?

1:10:05.659 --> 1:10:06.911
I'm keeping it!

1:10:07.077 --> 1:10:08.078
-Oh, no!
-Mei-Mei!

1:10:08.162 --> 1:10:09.163
Stop her!

1:10:09.288 --> 1:10:10.289
-What are you doing?
-Stop, Mei-Mei!

1:10:10.372 --> 1:10:11.624
- Don't let her go!
- No!

1:10:11.707 --> 1:10:13.626
-Let go!
-What has come over you?

1:10:13.792 --> 1:10:15.419
Stop!
Get a hold of her!

1:10:15.586 --> 1:10:17.421
-Mei-Mei! Stop!
-Don't do this!

1:10:17.588 --> 1:10:19.590
-Mei-Mei!

1:10:19.757 --> 1:10:20.758
-No!

1:10:21.842 --> 1:10:23.510
I'm going to the concert!

1:10:24.428 --> 1:10:26.305
-Get back here!
-Mei-Mei! Stop!

1:10:26.472 --> 1:10:28.140
-A concert?
-No!

1:10:29.808 --> 1:10:31.727
-This is a disaster.

1:10:31.810 --> 1:10:33.479
Unbelievable. Ming!

1:10:33.646 --> 1:10:34.730
Too good to be true.

1:10:34.897 --> 1:10:36.315
How could you let this happen?

1:10:36.899 --> 1:10:38.651
-She's out of control!

1:10:38.984 --> 1:10:41.028
Ming, it's okay.

1:10:41.195 --> 1:10:42.238
Ming! Ming!
Answer me!

1:10:42.321 --> 1:10:43.322
What are we going to do
about this?

1:10:43.489 --> 1:10:45.407
How could she?

1:10:48.077 --> 1:10:50.412
How could she do this to...

1:10:50.579 --> 1:10:52.790
her own mother?

1:11:03.676 --> 1:11:04.927
-Ming?

1:11:06.428 --> 1:11:08.305
Mei-Mei!

1:11:12.643 --> 1:11:13.644
Excuse me!

1:11:41.380 --> 1:11:42.464
Whoo! Yeah!

1:11:44.091 --> 1:11:45.092
4-Town!

1:11:48.929 --> 1:11:49.930
-Mei!
-Mei!

1:11:50.055 --> 1:11:51.724
-You're here!
-What are you doing here?

1:11:53.100 --> 1:11:54.518
I couldn't do it.

1:11:54.685 --> 1:11:58.188
The panda's a part of me,
and you guys are too.

1:11:58.731 --> 1:12:00.941
Mei, you threw us
under the bus.

1:12:01.150 --> 1:12:02.985
I know and I'm sorry.

1:12:03.152 --> 1:12:04.320
I've been, like, obsessed

1:12:04.403 --> 1:12:06.071
with my mom's approval
my whole life.

1:12:06.238 --> 1:12:08.574
I couldn't take losing it,

1:12:09.700 --> 1:12:12.036
but losing you guys
feels even worse.

1:12:12.953 --> 1:12:14.246
Well, too bad.

1:12:14.913 --> 1:12:16.248
'Cause you did.

1:12:20.210 --> 1:12:21.211
Robaire Junior?

1:12:21.378 --> 1:12:22.880
She's been
taking care of him 24/7.

1:12:23.005 --> 1:12:24.006
No.

1:12:24.131 --> 1:12:25.174
And singing him lullabies
every night!

1:12:25.341 --> 1:12:27.259
No, no, no, I haven't.

1:12:27.426 --> 1:12:28.969
-They're lying.

1:12:29.053 --> 1:12:30.804
-Here.

1:12:30.888 --> 1:12:32.222
Found him at Tyler's.

1:12:37.478 --> 1:12:39.146
4-Town forever?

1:12:41.273 --> 1:12:43.108
4-Town forever.

1:12:43.275 --> 1:12:45.569
-4-Town forever.
-4-Town forever!

1:12:45.736 --> 1:12:47.571
-Tyler?

1:12:47.696 --> 1:12:50.866
No! Tyler? Who's Tyler?
I don't know a...

1:12:51.033 --> 1:12:53.827
You are a 4-Townie?

1:12:54.828 --> 1:12:55.829
-No! Stop!

1:12:55.996 --> 1:12:56.997
-No way!
-Yeah!

1:12:57.122 --> 1:12:58.248
Welcome to the sisterhood!

1:12:58.332 --> 1:12:59.500
Whatever, dorks.

1:12:59.666 --> 1:13:00.793
Cut it out!

1:13:00.959 --> 1:13:02.378
Your mom
must have gone nuclear.

1:13:02.544 --> 1:13:04.254
Who cares?
What's she gonna do?

1:13:04.338 --> 1:13:05.422
Ground me?

1:13:09.218 --> 1:13:12.471
4-Town! 4-Town! 4-Town!

1:13:12.638 --> 1:13:14.139
4-Town! 4-Town!

1:13:19.395 --> 1:13:20.521
Let's go!

1:13:20.604 --> 1:13:21.897
Is it starting? It's starting!

1:13:22.064 --> 1:13:23.065
-Guys, hold me.

1:13:24.733 --> 1:13:28.320
Four, three, two, one!

1:13:30.406 --> 1:13:32.533
Are you ready?

1:13:35.452 --> 1:13:36.662
Oh, my gosh!

1:13:37.538 --> 1:13:39.248
Yeah! Z!

1:13:39.415 --> 1:13:40.624
I love you, man!

1:13:41.333 --> 1:13:43.168
Yeah! Yeah!

1:13:46.547 --> 1:13:48.132
Yes! Jesse!

1:13:49.299 --> 1:13:52.636
Toronto! Who knows what's up?

1:13:55.222 --> 1:13:56.598
Yes!

1:14:00.352 --> 1:14:01.437
You want it?

1:14:01.603 --> 1:14:02.604
I want it

1:14:02.771 --> 1:14:04.773
-You want it?
-I want it

1:14:05.065 --> 1:14:06.942
-You want it?
-I want it

1:14:07.109 --> 1:14:09.445
Give me one, two, three, four

1:14:10.028 --> 1:14:11.905
You wanted it
You went for it

1:14:12.114 --> 1:14:13.157
And, baby, you got it

1:14:14.366 --> 1:14:15.951
I wanted it
I went for it

1:14:17.327 --> 1:14:21.707
And, baby, I did it on my own

1:14:21.874 --> 1:14:26.837
Did it on my own

1:14:27.629 --> 1:14:29.965
Own

1:14:30.132 --> 1:14:31.133
Did it on my own

1:14:31.216 --> 1:14:32.968
-Mei-Mei!

1:14:38.765 --> 1:14:39.766
No way!

1:14:40.601 --> 1:14:41.894
Is this part of the show?

1:14:44.229 --> 1:14:46.190
Is this special effects?

1:14:46.773 --> 1:14:47.774
-Help! Help!

1:14:47.858 --> 1:14:50.110
Mei-Mei!

1:14:50.652 --> 1:14:53.280
Where are you?

1:14:55.073 --> 1:14:56.074
Mom?

1:14:56.742 --> 1:14:57.743
Mei-Mei!

1:15:04.875 --> 1:15:06.627
-I want a refund.
-What's her problem?

1:15:06.793 --> 1:15:08.295
Mei!

1:15:15.802 --> 1:15:17.095
It was just getting good!

1:15:17.179 --> 1:15:18.347
This isn't cool.

1:15:21.350 --> 1:15:23.268
-Mei! Mei!
-Dad?

1:15:23.435 --> 1:15:24.645
We have to save your mother!

1:15:24.811 --> 1:15:25.896
She's gone loco!

1:15:26.063 --> 1:15:28.023
Mei, we have to do
the ritual again.

1:15:28.190 --> 1:15:29.858
What happened? She's huge!

1:15:30.025 --> 1:15:31.235
I told you she was big!

1:15:31.443 --> 1:15:32.569
That big?

1:15:32.778 --> 1:15:34.613
-Mei-Mei!

1:15:34.696 --> 1:15:35.864
Ming!
She's your daughter!

1:15:36.031 --> 1:15:37.032
Mei!

1:15:37.157 --> 1:15:38.325
-Let her go!
-Don't hurt her!

1:15:38.492 --> 1:15:41.870
You are in big trouble,
young lady!

1:15:42.037 --> 1:15:43.038
Mom! Let go!

1:15:43.163 --> 1:15:45.207
I'm shutting this down,

1:15:45.374 --> 1:15:47.042
right now!

1:15:48.502 --> 1:15:50.462
Everyone, go home!

1:15:50.629 --> 1:15:52.089
Where are your parents?

1:15:52.256 --> 1:15:54.007
Put some clothes on!

1:15:56.718 --> 1:15:59.596
This isn't you!

1:16:00.722 --> 1:16:02.558
This is me!

1:16:08.230 --> 1:16:09.898
-Mei-Mei!
-Mei! Are you hurt?

1:16:11.275 --> 1:16:13.527
I'm not your little
Mei-Mei anymore!

1:16:13.694 --> 1:16:15.654
I lied, Mom!

1:16:15.821 --> 1:16:16.822
What?

1:16:16.989 --> 1:16:19.366
It was my idea
to hustle the panda.

1:16:19.533 --> 1:16:22.160
My idea
to go to Tyler's party!

1:16:22.327 --> 1:16:24.496
It was all me!

1:16:24.913 --> 1:16:26.123
I like boys!

1:16:26.290 --> 1:16:28.083
I like loud music!

1:16:28.250 --> 1:16:30.210
I like gyrating!

1:16:30.377 --> 1:16:32.838
I'm 13! Deal with it!

1:16:43.599 --> 1:16:46.184
The ritual.
Everyone in position.

1:16:46.643 --> 1:16:48.228
Mei-Mei, keep her busy.

1:16:48.395 --> 1:16:49.938
Oh, I'll keep her busy.

1:16:50.689 --> 1:16:52.566
Where's Jin? Jin!

1:16:53.817 --> 1:16:56.528
Mei!
Keep her in the circle!

1:16:56.695 --> 1:16:58.614
Get back here!

1:16:58.780 --> 1:17:00.115
Make me!

1:17:00.282 --> 1:17:02.534
You think
you're so mature!

1:17:03.118 --> 1:17:04.411
Lying to me!

1:17:05.287 --> 1:17:06.913
Blaming me!

1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:10.250
How could you be so, so...

1:17:10.417 --> 1:17:12.127
crass?

1:17:12.753 --> 1:17:15.005
Oh!
That's nothing!

1:17:15.172 --> 1:17:16.923
You wanna see crass?

1:17:18.550 --> 1:17:20.510
-What are you doing?
-You like that? Yes!

1:17:20.677 --> 1:17:22.512
-Stop moving like that!
-What's wrong?

1:17:22.679 --> 1:17:24.389
-Is this bothering you?
-Stop it!

1:17:24.556 --> 1:17:25.724
Yeah, Mei!

1:17:25.807 --> 1:17:27.684
Destroy her
with your big butt!

1:17:27.976 --> 1:17:29.019
Yeah! Go, go, go!

1:17:29.394 --> 1:17:31.188
Start singing now!

1:17:31.355 --> 1:17:32.397
Ladies!

1:17:35.359 --> 1:17:37.903
-Stop!

1:17:39.738 --> 1:17:40.781
Sing louder!

1:17:40.947 --> 1:17:42.199
We're trying.

1:17:43.033 --> 1:17:44.618
-Stop it!
-Let's get out of here!

1:17:44.743 --> 1:17:45.994
Come on!

1:17:46.119 --> 1:17:47.829
-Huh? Take it, Mom! Take it!
-No!

1:17:49.414 --> 1:17:52.417
Stop it! Stop!

1:17:58.799 --> 1:18:00.133
All I wanted...

1:18:00.217 --> 1:18:04.012
-...was to go to a concert!

1:18:05.222 --> 1:18:07.641
I never went to concerts!

1:18:07.808 --> 1:18:10.227
I put my family first!

1:18:10.394 --> 1:18:12.688
I tried to be a good daughter!

1:18:15.941 --> 1:18:17.901
Well, sorry I'm not perfect!

1:18:18.110 --> 1:18:20.195
Sorry I'm not good enough!

1:18:21.238 --> 1:18:24.157
And sorry
I'll never be like you!

1:18:39.881 --> 1:18:40.882
Oh, no!

1:18:41.049 --> 1:18:42.884
Mom... Mom!

1:18:52.644 --> 1:18:53.770
-No!

1:18:57.357 --> 1:19:00.736
Mom!
You have to get in the circle!

1:19:02.738 --> 1:19:04.030
Wake up!

1:19:05.824 --> 1:19:07.075
I'm sorry!

1:19:07.993 --> 1:19:09.911
Mom? Come on.

1:19:10.746 --> 1:19:11.747
Please!

1:19:18.837 --> 1:19:21.131
Sun Yee, give me strength.

1:19:33.268 --> 1:19:34.936
-Pull, Mei-Mei!
-Grandma?

1:19:35.103 --> 1:19:37.355
I am not losing my daughter.

1:19:37.522 --> 1:19:38.815
Don't just stand there!

1:19:55.874 --> 1:19:57.751
Make room
for your elders, Mei-Mei!

1:19:57.834 --> 1:19:59.586
-What?
-We're with you!

1:19:59.753 --> 1:20:01.421
But what are you doing?
What if you can't turn back?

1:20:01.588 --> 1:20:03.340
- Your mom needs us!
- She's family!

1:20:03.507 --> 1:20:05.300
Less talking, more pulling!

1:20:05.467 --> 1:20:08.053
-This fur is so itchy!
-Quiet, Lily!

1:20:20.023 --> 1:20:21.191
Louder!

1:20:21.358 --> 1:20:22.984
Sing from the heart!

1:20:23.151 --> 1:20:25.445
Louder!
The circle isn't working!

1:20:35.914 --> 1:20:38.792
-Never met nobody
-Nobody

1:20:40.335 --> 1:20:41.586
Never met, never met,
never met

1:20:41.753 --> 1:20:45.882
Like

1:20:46.258 --> 1:20:48.593
You

1:20:57.435 --> 1:20:58.562
Get up

1:20:58.728 --> 1:21:01.189
I never met nobody

1:21:01.481 --> 1:21:02.858
Like you

1:21:04.192 --> 1:21:05.861
Had friends
and I've had buddies

1:21:06.152 --> 1:21:07.529
-It's true

1:21:07.612 --> 1:21:11.867
But they don't turn my tummy
The way you do

1:21:12.200 --> 1:21:16.288
I've never met nobody like you

1:21:17.038 --> 1:21:21.501
You're never not on my mind
Oh, my, oh, my

1:21:21.668 --> 1:21:25.839
I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side

1:21:26.047 --> 1:21:30.468
I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry

1:21:30.719 --> 1:21:33.555
I'll never not be
your ride or die

1:21:33.722 --> 1:21:37.142
All right!

1:21:40.979 --> 1:21:42.439
Huh?

1:21:43.940 --> 1:21:45.984
Mom? Mom!

1:21:59.372 --> 1:22:02.417
Mom? Are you okay?
We have to...

1:22:02.709 --> 1:22:05.170
Mom?

1:22:05.670 --> 1:22:09.341
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

1:22:12.719 --> 1:22:13.887
What happened?

1:22:14.971 --> 1:22:16.765
I... I hurt her.

1:22:17.807 --> 1:22:18.808
Who?

1:22:18.975 --> 1:22:20.101
My mom!

1:22:20.685 --> 1:22:24.606
I got so angry,
and I lost control.

1:22:26.024 --> 1:22:28.818
I'm just so sick
of being perfect!

1:22:28.985 --> 1:22:31.279
I'm never gonna be
good enough for her.

1:22:32.197 --> 1:22:33.490
Or anyone.

1:22:46.836 --> 1:22:48.880
I know it feels that way.

1:22:49.047 --> 1:22:51.299
Like, all the time.

1:22:52.467 --> 1:22:56.805
But... it isn't true.

1:23:02.310 --> 1:23:03.436
Come on.

1:23:34.509 --> 1:23:35.635
Really? I could explode
at any moment.

1:23:35.802 --> 1:23:37.012
-We have to find them.
-Where are they?

1:23:37.178 --> 1:23:39.514
-Finally.
-Hurry, hurry!

1:23:39.681 --> 1:23:40.765
Where have you been?
Come on!

1:23:40.932 --> 1:23:43.101
-Let's get the lead out!
-Ladies.

1:23:53.778 --> 1:23:56.448
-I'm sorry.
-Shh!

1:23:56.740 --> 1:23:59.117
You don't have to apologize.

1:24:01.536 --> 1:24:03.079
I'm your mother.

1:24:08.668 --> 1:24:12.839
May Sun Yee guide you
and keep you safe.

1:24:13.590 --> 1:24:16.426
One at a time, ladies.
And quickly.

1:24:18.595 --> 1:24:19.596
That's it?

1:24:19.763 --> 1:24:21.306
Mei-Mei's keeping the panda?

1:24:21.473 --> 1:24:24.559
It's her life. Now move.

1:24:47.749 --> 1:24:50.085
Go ahead. It's okay.

1:25:12.315 --> 1:25:13.316
No.

1:25:13.483 --> 1:25:17.028
Mei-Mei, please.
Just come with me.

1:25:18.696 --> 1:25:21.241
I'm changing, Mom.

1:25:21.908 --> 1:25:25.286
I'm finally figuring out
who I am.

1:25:27.080 --> 1:25:29.582
But...

1:25:29.791 --> 1:25:32.544
I'm scared it'll take me away
from you.

1:25:35.213 --> 1:25:36.297
Me too.

1:25:38.258 --> 1:25:39.926
I see you, Mei-Mei.

1:25:40.677 --> 1:25:42.971
You try to make
everyone happy,

1:25:43.054 --> 1:25:45.265
but are so hard on yourself.

1:25:45.431 --> 1:25:48.143
And if I taught you that...

1:25:50.562 --> 1:25:51.604
I'm sorry.

1:25:53.565 --> 1:25:55.525
So, don't hold back.

1:25:56.401 --> 1:25:57.485
For anyone.

1:26:02.198 --> 1:26:03.950
The farther you go,

1:26:04.742 --> 1:26:06.411
the prouder I'll be.

1:26:24.804 --> 1:26:28.558
I'm not going
to regret this, am I?

1:26:57.045 --> 1:27:00.715
I'm Meilin Lee,
and ever since I turned 13,

1:27:00.882 --> 1:27:04.260
life's been a lot.

1:27:04.427 --> 1:27:08.181
People still talk about
Pandapocalypse 2002.

1:27:09.057 --> 1:27:11.142
Mom and I just call it...

1:27:11.309 --> 1:27:12.435
growing pains.

1:27:14.812 --> 1:27:17.232
This thing's hungry
all the time.

1:27:17.398 --> 1:27:19.275
Eat up, little one.
Oh, you're so hungry.

1:27:19.442 --> 1:27:21.027
-Munch, munch, munch.
-What?

1:27:21.110 --> 1:27:23.404
Mr. Gao had to put
her panda in something.

1:27:23.571 --> 1:27:25.073
You should see Grandma's.

1:27:25.198 --> 1:27:28.701
-Hmph! So unlucky.

1:27:33.289 --> 1:27:34.290
You ready?

1:27:34.457 --> 1:27:35.541
Let's do this.

1:27:36.042 --> 1:27:38.253
-Hello! Welcome to our temple!
-What up, Toronto!

1:27:38.419 --> 1:27:39.629
-Get in here!
-Yes, come on in.

1:27:39.796 --> 1:27:42.173
And things at the temple
have never been better.

1:27:42.340 --> 1:27:44.384
O-M-G! That looks so cute!

1:27:44.550 --> 1:27:47.303
Our temple
is the oldest in Toronto.

1:27:47.470 --> 1:27:51.349
And the only one that's home
to the great red panda.

1:27:55.061 --> 1:27:56.145
Say "bamboo leaves!"

1:27:56.312 --> 1:27:58.106
- Bamboo leaves!
- Mei!

1:27:58.273 --> 1:27:59.565
-Hey!
-Guys!

1:27:59.732 --> 1:28:01.025
-What's up?
-Bring it in!

1:28:01.150 --> 1:28:02.986
-Ready to get your karaoke on?

1:28:03.152 --> 1:28:04.279
Totally.

1:28:05.530 --> 1:28:06.739
Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad!

1:28:06.906 --> 1:28:09.659
Hold on. You're not
going out like that, are you?

1:28:09.826 --> 1:28:11.995
My panda,
my choice, Mom.

1:28:12.912 --> 1:28:15.581
I'll be back
before dinner, okay?

1:28:15.665 --> 1:28:17.834
Fine. Oh, um...

1:28:17.917 --> 1:28:19.627
You're welcome to join us.

1:28:19.752 --> 1:28:21.129
For Mr. Lee's cooking?

1:28:21.212 --> 1:28:22.547
-Uh, yeah!
-We're so there.

1:28:22.714 --> 1:28:24.007
Don't load up on junk.

1:28:24.173 --> 1:28:25.717
Thanks for covering
for me, Dad.

1:28:25.883 --> 1:28:27.343
Have fun!

1:28:27.593 --> 1:28:30.013
And I'll beatbox.
And I can bleach my hair, too.

1:28:30.388 --> 1:28:31.723
-And, yeah...

1:28:32.432 --> 1:28:35.143
sometimes I miss
how things were,

1:28:36.060 --> 1:28:38.521
but nothing stays
the same forever.

1:28:38.688 --> 1:28:41.816
O-M-G! I'm so excited
for the new album.

1:28:41.983 --> 1:28:44.235
-We've all got an inner beast.

1:28:44.402 --> 1:28:46.237
We've all got
a messy, loud,

1:28:46.321 --> 1:28:49.490
weird part of ourselves
hidden away.

1:28:49.657 --> 1:28:52.201
And a lot of us
never let it out.

1:28:52.910 --> 1:28:54.120
But I did.

1:28:54.996 --> 1:28:56.914
How about you?

1:29:00.918 --> 1:29:03.755
Oh, yeah

1:29:04.505 --> 1:29:08.926
I've never met nobody like you

1:29:09.010 --> 1:29:12.638
Had friends
and I've had buddies

1:29:12.722 --> 1:29:13.723
It's true

1:29:13.806 --> 1:29:18.519
But they don't turn my tummy
The way you do

1:29:18.603 --> 1:29:23.066
I've never met nobody like you

1:29:26.569 --> 1:29:28.071
Yeah

1:29:32.325 --> 1:29:36.371
You're never not on my mind
Oh, my, oh, my

1:29:36.454 --> 1:29:41.167
I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side

1:29:41.250 --> 1:29:45.922
I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry

1:29:46.005 --> 1:29:49.258
I'll never not be your ride
or die

1:29:49.342 --> 1:29:50.676
All right

1:29:51.719 --> 1:29:53.971
Let's call it what it is
It's a masterpiece

1:29:54.055 --> 1:29:56.682
Got a whole lotta love
for them city streets

1:29:56.766 --> 1:29:58.226
Tonight is the place to be

1:29:58.309 --> 1:30:00.561
Got a big boom box
and a new CD

1:30:00.645 --> 1:30:02.980
-Come on!
-Everybody, let's tear it up

1:30:03.064 --> 1:30:05.400
If you want mad skills
You can share with us

1:30:06.067 --> 1:30:07.568
Everybody just stop and stare

1:30:07.652 --> 1:30:10.196
And you know why, it's me
Robaire

1:30:10.279 --> 1:30:11.364
Woo!

1:30:12.532 --> 1:30:13.616
Unh!

1:30:16.994 --> 1:30:18.121
Let's go!

1:30:18.204 --> 1:30:22.542
You're never not on my mind
Oh, my, oh, my

1:30:22.625 --> 1:30:27.004
I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side

1:30:27.088 --> 1:30:31.717
I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry

1:30:31.801 --> 1:30:34.929
I'll never not be your ride
or die

1:30:35.012 --> 1:30:36.431
All right

1:30:39.225 --> 1:30:40.226
Like you

1:30:41.477 --> 1:30:42.478
Like you

1:30:43.688 --> 1:30:44.689
Like you

1:30:45.148 --> 1:30:46.983
Like you, like you

1:30:48.109 --> 1:30:49.110
Like you

1:30:50.361 --> 1:30:51.362
Like you

1:30:52.655 --> 1:30:54.574
Like you, like you

1:30:54.657 --> 1:30:59.036
I've never met nobody like you

1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:02.248
Had friends
and I've had buddies

1:31:02.331 --> 1:31:03.416
It's true

1:31:03.499 --> 1:31:08.045
But they don't turn my tummy
The way you do

1:31:08.129 --> 1:31:12.758
I've never met nobody like you

1:31:15.344 --> 1:31:19.724
You're never not on my mind
Oh, my, oh, my

1:31:19.807 --> 1:31:24.312
I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side

1:31:24.395 --> 1:31:28.816
I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry

1:31:28.900 --> 1:31:32.361
I'll never not be your ride
or die

1:31:32.445 --> 1:31:33.529
All right

1:31:37.617 --> 1:31:40.244
Ooh

1:31:41.537 --> 1:31:43.831
Yeah

1:31:45.541 --> 1:31:47.460
Yeah

1:31:50.963 --> 1:31:54.383
Heavy rain from my cloudy eye

1:31:54.467 --> 1:31:56.802
Every time you say

1:31:56.886 --> 1:32:00.556
That it isn't why
I used to call you babe

1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:03.684
But you're the light
of my life

1:32:06.938 --> 1:32:13.069
I drove by your house
29 times today

1:32:14.820 --> 1:32:21.285
And nobody else
could make me feel this way

1:32:21.869 --> 1:32:26.874
Nobody else

1:32:29.835 --> 1:32:33.965
Nobody else, nobody

1:32:34.048 --> 1:32:38.928
'Cause you've opened my eyes
and stolen my heart

1:32:39.011 --> 1:32:42.932
You make me believe
that love can be hard

1:32:43.015 --> 1:32:47.603
And I can never survive
a minute apart

1:32:47.937 --> 1:32:52.441
You are my one true love

1:32:52.858 --> 1:32:56.654
My one true love

1:32:56.862 --> 1:33:00.324
My heaven above

1:33:00.825 --> 1:33:05.454
My one true love

1:33:10.918 --> 1:33:14.630
Heavy rain on a Saturday

1:33:14.714 --> 1:33:18.342
When you said my name
in the saddest way

1:33:18.426 --> 1:33:20.636
Nothing numbs the pain

1:33:20.720 --> 1:33:24.515
You're still the light
of my life

1:33:27.018 --> 1:33:32.940
I drove by your house
10,000 times last year

1:33:35.192 --> 1:33:40.948
Nobody else
wanted to dry my tears

1:33:41.866 --> 1:33:47.455
Nobody else

1:33:49.707 --> 1:33:54.295
Nobody else, nobody else

1:33:58.382 --> 1:34:03.054
'Cause you've opened my eyes
and stolen my heart

1:34:03.137 --> 1:34:07.058
You make me believe
that love can be hard

1:34:07.141 --> 1:34:11.729
And I can never survive
a minute apart

1:34:12.229 --> 1:34:16.984
You are my one true love

1:34:17.068 --> 1:34:21.072
My one true love

1:34:21.155 --> 1:34:24.992
My heaven above

1:34:25.076 --> 1:34:29.830
My one true love

1:34:30.456 --> 1:34:32.375
Yeah

1:34:33.751 --> 1:34:36.212
Yeah

1:34:47.973 --> 1:34:50.643
Nobody else
