Previously on Ninjago...

00:02.102 --> 00:03.968
Previously on Ninjago...

00:08.041 --> 00:10.874
- Nadakhan.
- I am free?

00:11.044 --> 00:13.342
<i>-- Can I be of assistance?</i>

00:13.514 --> 00:15.778
Where is this Realm Crystal?

00:15.949 --> 00:18.111
<i>Sensei Wu of Spinjitzu.</i>

00:20.000 --> 00:26.074

01:06.500 --> 01:07.865
We're closed.

01:09.303 --> 01:12.295
I'm starving. You got anything?

01:12.472 --> 01:15.169
Anything? Sure.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.637
Hmm.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.618
Ninja Chips.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.812
Mmm! Oh, my favorite.

01:29.556 --> 01:30.546
Any questions?

01:30.724 --> 01:31.885
<i>How do you find a Ninja?</i>

01:32.059 --> 01:35.620
<i>The Ninja are still at large
and public enemy number one.</i>

01:35.796 --> 01:37.127
Did fame turn them?

01:41.768 --> 01:42.758
Gentle.

01:43.870 --> 01:44.928
Gentle.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.700
Aw, come on!

01:51.411 --> 01:55.143
<i>We've taken their ship
as well as secured their known hideouts.</i>

01:55.315 --> 01:58.046
<i>They will be caught
and pay for their crime spree.</i>

01:58.986 --> 02:00.920
<i>BALL CLATTERS)
- I bet my reelection on it.</i>

02:02.255 --> 02:04.383
<i>REPORTER 7.". Can you tell us what's being
done to find them?</i>

02:04.558 --> 02:06.048
<i>Er, no, no more questions.</i>

02:09.630 --> 02:10.620
That is all.

02:16.903 --> 02:19.099
Looks like you don't have an eye
for this sorta work.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.138
You're never gonna catch 'em, Commish.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.073
If you want to catch a Ninja,
you have to know a Ninja.

02:24.244 --> 02:27.839
Ronin, you're no better
than the crooks you catch.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.244
I'll find them.

02:29.416 --> 02:31.942
I've already got that bookworm Misako
in custody.

02:32.452 --> 02:33.544
But what about the Sensei?

02:33.720 --> 02:36.621
Wu? He was last seen entering
the Domu Library,

02:36.790 --> 02:38.258
but no one saw him come out.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.987
Those Ninja!

02:41.161 --> 02:43.755
They get all that power,
then use it to do what?

02:43.930 --> 02:46.558
Rob the only place that loved them.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.098
Spoiled brats!

02:49.202 --> 02:52.797
So, uh, you sure
you can bring 'em to justice?

02:52.973 --> 02:54.407
With a bow On.

02:54.574 --> 02:57.009
All I need in return is a clean slate

02:57.177 --> 03:00.112
so I can pile all that fresh money
you're gonna give me onto it.

03:00.280 --> 03:04.183
Catch all five of them, Mr. Ronin,
you can have anything you want.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.683
It's six. There's six of them now.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.220
And she's probably the toughest one
to catch.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.230
Just come clean, tell us where they are.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.565
We know you're protecting them. Spill it!

03:20.967 --> 03:24.870
Like I said, it wasn't them.
They were framed.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.666
You should be searching
for the real culprits.

03:27.841 --> 03:28.831
Right.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.977
That's what my mother would say too.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.636
Maybe we should give her some time
to sweat it out.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.839
Come on, Simon.

03:36.016 --> 03:40.647
Why won't you tell me where Wu is?
I wish to speak to someone in charge!

03:46.226 --> 03:48.991
Your wish is yours to keep.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.430
My wish? No!

03:51.898 --> 03:53.024
Oh. yes!

03:54.234 --> 03:55.759
Help!

03:56.103 --> 03:59.368
Uncuff me! Don't leave me alone with him!

03:59.539 --> 04:03.476
No one's behind there, unfortunately.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.373
Ooh! Someone was kind enough
to bring donuts.

04:07.547 --> 04:11.677
I know you. You're Nadakhan the Djinn.
I knew it.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.253
Clouse was looking for
the Teapot of Tyrahn.

04:14.488 --> 04:18.288
Oh, you mean this?

04:18.591 --> 04:20.583
<i>It's smaller in person, I know.</i>

04:20.761 --> 04:24.789
I was trapped inside it
for longer than I care to recall.

04:25.532 --> 04:28.092
But now Clouse is in there.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.203
And he has Wu to keep him company.

04:31.371 --> 04:34.830
Wu! What have you done to him?
What do you want?

04:35.008 --> 04:38.410
A good captain never leaves
his crew behind,

04:38.578 --> 04:41.309
and mine was taken from me.

04:42.382 --> 04:45.875
I've read about you.
You were a pirate captain.

04:46.052 --> 04:50.011
The stories said you could grant wishes
for others, but not for yourself.

04:50.190 --> 04:53.820
Is that why you made your living taking
what never belonged to you?

04:53.994 --> 04:57.658
Yes, I cannot wish for myself,

04:57.831 --> 05:01.267
but I can always get what I want.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.770
Wu already told me
where the Realm Crystal is,

05:04.938 --> 05:09.068
but I will still need your help.

05:09.876 --> 05:12.004
Even if you were to find it
in Hiroshi's Labyrinth,

05:12.179 --> 05:13.772
you'd never find your way out.

05:13.947 --> 05:18.714
So, it's hidden in Hiroshi's
Labyrinth, you say?

05:19.820 --> 05:22.846
Wu didn't tell you. You tricked me.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.953
I wish I hadn't said anything
in the first place.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.116
Another wish?

05:28.395 --> 05:31.057
I thought you'd never ask.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.790
No!

05:36.536 --> 05:37.867
She's gone.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.564
Well, I can see that. I'm not blind.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.208
But your eye is twitching.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.104
Hmm.

05:44.744 --> 05:47.304
We may have just
gotten a hit on one of the Ninja.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.448
Kai just updated his status.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.547
Hmm. Really?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.291
Where did he say he was?

06:01.461 --> 06:03.759
We've tracked him heading north
on Wilfert Boulevard.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.297
Oh, wait, and now east on Flemming!

06:07.434 --> 06:09.903
<i>The Ninja haven't been seen in days,</i>

06:10.070 --> 06:13.062
<i>but that hasn't stopped
one from updating his status.</i>

06:13.240 --> 06:15.470
<i>@5'Va13 posted</i>

06:15.642 --> 06:21.581
<i>â€œA place of peace, a place to fight, a
brotherhood born on one fateful night."</i>

06:22.215 --> 06:27.415
<i>What does it mean? ls it a message?
ls it a riddle? Orjust a bad poem?</i>

06:35.328 --> 06:37.490
Now he's heading down Donovan Boulevard.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.154
He's taking a back alley!

06:39.332 --> 06:41.801
I want him boxed in! Land this thing!

06:58.151 --> 06:59.676
Come out with your hands up!

07:05.392 --> 07:08.293
It's not Kai, sir.
It's his communication device.

07:08.461 --> 07:11.556
He gave it to the rat so we'd go
on a wild goose-chase.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.930
Uh, I mean, wild rat-chase.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.095
Yes, thank you, detective.

07:16.903 --> 07:18.166
Your eye is twitching.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.897
I'm not blind!

07:27.147 --> 07:28.137
Seriously?

07:28.315 --> 07:31.751
I was the last one to figure out it was
Wu's old monastery?

07:31.918 --> 07:33.408
And Lloyd wasn't even trained here.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.215
It will only be a matter of time
before they find this place too,

07:37.390 --> 07:38.789
so there isn't much time.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.449
Zane, show 'em what you found.

07:41.227 --> 07:44.424
I came across security footage
of Sensei at the Library of Domu.

07:44.597 --> 07:45.928
He was not alone.

07:47.767 --> 07:50.065
Hey, look. It's Wu.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.265
What happened? Who was he looking at?

07:55.442 --> 07:57.604
We don't know,
but no one's seen him since.

07:57.777 --> 08:00.542
The library database indicated
he had checked out a book

08:00.714 --> 08:02.648
<i>about the Teapot of Tyrahn.</i>

08:02.816 --> 08:05.376
We originally thought
we may be dealing with Clouse.

08:05.552 --> 08:09.511
If this is what I think it is,
it appears to be far worse.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.248
We may have a Djinn on our hands.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.550
A Djinn?

08:12.726 --> 08:15.491
Like a genie,
only when he grants you wishes,

08:15.662 --> 08:17.562
you'll be wishing you'd never met him.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.557
What else do we know about Djinn?

08:21.034 --> 08:26.336
Hmm. Not much, just that they
are very sneaky and have great power.

08:27.607 --> 08:30.235
I do believe smiling is not
the proper reaction

08:30.410 --> 08:32.037
when one is warned about a Djinn.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.976
But Nya said they grant wishes,

08:34.147 --> 08:36.479
and with wishes,
anything is possible, right?

08:37.183 --> 08:40.174
Hmm. My logic parameters do not allow me
to understand

08:40.352 --> 08:41.946
the full extent of a wish,

08:42.121 --> 08:44.523
but I am curious where you're going
with this.

08:44.924 --> 08:48.087
Nya made it clear there was no way we'd
ever end up together,

08:48.261 --> 08:51.253
but I know for a fact from seeing
my future that we do.

08:51.431 --> 08:55.527
Maybe a wish is what it takes.
Maybe this is how she falls for me.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.692
Then it's settled.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.064
Since we know so little about Djinns,

08:59.272 --> 09:02.037
we need to head back to town
to investigate more about him.

09:02.308 --> 09:03.332
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:03.576 --> 09:07.240
If we head back together,
the police will arrest us on sight.

09:07.414 --> 09:08.506
We should split up.

09:08.681 --> 09:11.651
But anyone caught alone with this
character suddenly disappears.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.149
Then we travel in pairs.

09:13.319 --> 09:16.254
Zane, you and I will head to
the library to see what else we can find.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.084
Wait, wait, wait.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.281
Yeah, yeah.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.086
Jay and I will look for clues
at the scene of the crime

09:21.261 --> 09:22.251
where he framed us.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.295
What do you say, buddy,
just like old times?

09:24.731 --> 09:28.258
Sweet.
Who doesn't love old times, eh?

09:29.202 --> 09:31.728
Kai, you and your sister see
what else is out there.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.272
If we want to clear
our names and get Sensei back,

09:34.441 --> 09:37.035
we need to find this Djinn
and take him down.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.575
Let's meet back here at sun up.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.442
Oh, and guys, look out for each other.

09:47.787 --> 09:51.155
You have a nice evening.
I hope you found all you needed.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.314
Oh, I did!

09:59.933 --> 10:00.923
Road clear.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.537
The book he was reading is still here.

10:06.806 --> 10:09.173
That camera took the footage of Sensei.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.969
We don't want to be spotted.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.943
Hacking into the library's
central computers now.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.319
Huh. The Teapot of Tyrahn.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.391
The ancient markings on the side describe

10:26.559 --> 10:28.857
it's a powerful relic
that can trap mortals.

10:29.696 --> 10:32.427
Oh. That may explain why people
are suddenly disappearing.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.033
And here's something more.

10:34.200 --> 10:38.034
Once a Djinn is freed from imprisonment,
the only way to destroy him is by...

10:38.805 --> 10:41.706
<i>Warning. An unknown presence
is hacking into our system.</i>

10:41.875 --> 10:43.001
Can you isolate the source?

10:43.176 --> 10:44.803
<i>It's coming from inside the building.</i>

10:46.546 --> 10:49.447
<i>Look at that, Tin Can,
I'm in your head.</i>

10:49.616 --> 10:51.380
<i>Sorry, didn't want it
to have to come to this,</i>

10:51.551 --> 10:53.178
<i>but a job's a job, right buddy?</i>

10:53.353 --> 10:55.720
What's wrong? Why did you stop reading?

10:55.889 --> 10:58.790
<i>I know it's unfair,
but I disabled your voice box.</i>

10:58.958 --> 11:02.553
<i>And now I'm shutting down your
defenses and oops, there go your arms.</i>

11:03.563 --> 11:04.587
Zane?

11:04.797 --> 11:07.630
<i>If it's any consolation,
ldidn't want to have to fight you.</i>

11:07.800 --> 11:10.064
<i>And now technically, Won't.</i>

11:10.236 --> 11:11.829
Good night, good buddy.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.029
Are you there?

11:18.211 --> 11:20.703
<i>I</i> took the liberty
to close off the <i>wing,</i> Lloyd.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.542
<i>Been meaning to say, love the TV spot.</i>

11:26.052 --> 11:27.451
<i>What was it you guys said?</i>

11:27.620 --> 11:30.112
<i>Reading is the first step
to every adventure?</i>

11:30.290 --> 11:32.384
Sorry, Zane, but I gotta get out of here.

11:33.893 --> 11:36.988
<i>Yeah, they installed those
to keep the bad guys out.</i>

11:37.163 --> 11:40.690
<i>Or was it the good guys in?
I don't remember for the life of me.</i>

11:40.867 --> 11:43.268
<i>Which are you, Lloyd?
A good guy or bad guy?</i>

11:43.436 --> 11:44.597
We were framed.

11:44.771 --> 11:48.036
You know us, Ronin.
We would never do any of that stuff.

11:48.208 --> 11:52.145
<i>You also know me, and I'm getting paid
an awful lotto bring you guys in.</i>

11:52.312 --> 11:54.440
How's Nya? Boy, I missed her.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.188
Boo!

12:19.339 --> 12:20.670
<i>-- Let's make this easy.</i>

12:20.840 --> 12:22.365
<i>H! take you back to the station,</i>

12:22.542 --> 12:24.670
<i>you can answer their questions
and clear your name.</i>

12:24.844 --> 12:26.539
Not until we stop the threat.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.148
And you're gonna pay
for what you did to Zane.

12:29.315 --> 12:30.305
But not today.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.322
Whoa!

12:42.228 --> 12:44.595
Looks like I didn't miss you, Lloyd.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.994
Two down, four to go.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.104
What are we doing all the way
out in Jamanakai Village?

12:53.273 --> 12:54.297
The genie was never out here.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.942
You mean Djinn.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.305
And since our dragons attract
too much attention,

12:58.478 --> 13:01.140
we'll need a more discreet mode
of transportation.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.713
Ninjago's a big place.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.307
Bicycle Chalet?

13:05.485 --> 13:06.884
I know they confiscated
all of our vehicles,

13:07.053 --> 13:09.454
but I was hoping for something
with a few more gears.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.954
They didn't take all of our vehicles.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.959
I always keep a spare
for times like these.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.634
I love my little sister.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.902
<i>It's Zane's SOS beacon.
There's trouble!</i>

13:30.476 --> 13:32.137
What are we waiting for? Lead the way.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.148
Hmm.

13:39.686 --> 13:42.348
The Realm Crystal.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.990
It is here.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.562
- lntruder, freeze. You are surrounded.
- Hmm.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.959
Strange metal men.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.198
Eh, you do have me surrounded.

13:58.371 --> 14:01.306
But I am a Captain.

14:01.474 --> 14:04.842
And Captains don't take orders
from anyone.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.569
He has a weapon! Fire!

14:16.389 --> 14:17.914
The future.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.390
Intruder, freeze.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.879
Well, that was easy.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.147
<i>Ahh.</i>

14:48.321 --> 14:51.256
Now it's starting to get interesting.

14:58.998 --> 15:00.124
<i>Ah!</i>

15:00.666 --> 15:02.862
The Realm Crystal.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.475
It is mine. Huh?

15:20.753 --> 15:24.348
What? Where is the real one?

15:26.359 --> 15:29.556
<i>Repair in sector five.
Repair in sector five.</i>

15:29.729 --> 15:30.719
You again.

15:31.898 --> 15:35.596
Well, maybe you can help me.

15:42.708 --> 15:46.406
Zane should be just up ahead.
But what are they doing out here?

15:46.579 --> 15:48.047
I thought they were at the Library?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.809
There he is! But where's Lloyd?

15:54.587 --> 15:55.782
That's not Zane.

15:55.955 --> 15:56.945
It's Ronin.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.113
Go around him!

16:10.036 --> 16:11.299
Go get 'em, Rex.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.230
We need to split up.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.207
We can't.
He bottled us up in here for a reason.

16:18.377 --> 16:19.902
We have to outrun him!

16:20.146 --> 16:22.171
Huh. Let's see
if he can keep up with this!

16:26.619 --> 16:29.418
Nice move, right back at you.

16:51.377 --> 16:53.141
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:53.379 --> 16:54.403
That's just rude.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.541
This way! He won't be able to follow us!

17:08.394 --> 17:10.294
We can't shake him.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.161
Never liked taking the high road.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.299
I can't believe this guy.

17:22.474 --> 17:23.464
Nya, look out!

17:32.518 --> 17:34.543
Off the bikes and hands up.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.623
And don't try any of that elemental stuff
or else Rex won't play nice.

17:41.394 --> 17:45.058
- We were framed. And then--
- Save it. Already heard it.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.995
All right, Rex, show's over.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.229
You tricked us!

17:51.370 --> 17:53.168
Four down, two to go.

17:58.110 --> 18:00.340
<i>The Realm Crystal has been compromised!</i>

18:00.513 --> 18:02.914
<i>Hurry, send all sentries to protect it!</i>

18:03.082 --> 18:04.641
Affirmative, Borg.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.410
Protect the Realm Crystal!

18:21.434 --> 18:22.560
The Realm Crystal.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.636
But Borg said it was compromised.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.297
It is now.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.070
Brainless tin cans!

18:36.782 --> 18:39.774
Looks like Mega Monster
Amusement Park shut down

18:39.952 --> 18:41.317
after it became a crime scene.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.922
Come on, let's go
check out the roller coaster.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.489
That's where Zane was framed.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.522
This place gives me
so many fond memories.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.924
It's here I found
my true potential.

18:51.097 --> 18:54.533
Ooh, and over there is where Nya and I
went on our first date.

18:54.700 --> 18:58.068
I bet one day she and I will laugh
about all this.

18:59.105 --> 19:02.370
Uh, I mean, why would she laugh at that?
She hates me.

19:02.541 --> 19:06.000
It's not like I'd expect anything
to suddenly change between her and I.

19:06.178 --> 19:08.203
Where is that roller coaster?

19:08.381 --> 19:10.816
The only thing this place gives me
is the creeps.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.008
Let's not stick around
any longer than we need to.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.010
There it is.

19:15.254 --> 19:18.747
Just what kind of
clues are we looking for?

19:18.958 --> 19:22.053
It's not like there are any witnesses
around to tell us what they saw.

19:22.228 --> 19:24.424
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

19:28.801 --> 19:32.601
It's practically
a visual timeline of the events that day.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.001
Jay, you're a genius.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.733
Like I said, it's where I found
my true potential.

19:38.544 --> 19:40.239
There! That's our guy.

19:40.546 --> 19:43.572
These pictures were taken seconds
after each other.

19:43.749 --> 19:46.411
That means that guy is Zane.

19:46.652 --> 19:49.644
- You mean--
- The Djinn can shape-shift.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.051
He could be anybody!

19:53.092 --> 19:55.459
Seriously?

19:56.295 --> 19:57.421
What did you do now?

19:58.364 --> 19:59.798
I didn't touch anything!

19:59.965 --> 20:02.434
<i>Guess we can
add trespassing to your charges.</i>

20:02.601 --> 20:05.093
<i>Don't bother calling your friends,
I already caught them.</i>

20:06.305 --> 20:08.933
Really? You're disappearing?
You're leaving me alone?

20:09.108 --> 20:11.736
If he already has the others,
we both can't get caught.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.573
<i>I'm sorry, but you're on your own.
Good luck.</i>

20:15.047 --> 20:16.947
A Ninja never leaves a Ninja behind!

20:17.750 --> 20:19.946
Some friend you are.

20:21.754 --> 20:25.691
And you. You think
you can electrify the Master of Lightning?

20:26.125 --> 20:28.719
Yeah, but are you the Master of Kablooey?

20:32.465 --> 20:34.229
It wasn't us, Ronin.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.029
We just saw that a Djinn
can look like any one of us.

20:38.204 --> 20:40.935
That's how he did it.
That's how he framed us.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.233
Tell it to the judge.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.785
If you take us all out,
who's going to protect Ninjago?

21:02.962 --> 21:03.952
Not my problem.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.224
Ha-ha!

21:18.010 --> 21:19.910
Oh! Not good.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.912
Five down, one to go.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.250
Come out, come out wherever you are!

21:31.090 --> 21:32.080
Funnel cake.

21:34.026 --> 21:38.259
I know you're here.
The funnel cake did you in.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.296
You always were a nervous eater.

21:40.466 --> 21:44.061
<i>COLE". Maybe, but how do you catch
what you can't see?</i>

21:44.270 --> 21:47.205
Oh! Where am I? <i>Am I</i> over here?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.866
Or am <i>I</i> over here?

21:50.075 --> 21:51.736
Maybe I'm over here?

21:52.111 --> 21:55.103
I'm not just like a ghost, I am a ghost!

21:55.748 --> 21:57.512
I got thermal vision, Cole.

21:57.683 --> 21:58.673
<i>You do?</i>

21:58.884 --> 22:00.249
Ahh!

22:00.519 --> 22:03.420
Look at that. I'm a winner.

22:05.057 --> 22:08.220
The search is over. We have the Ninja.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.430
Ninjago is safe once again.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.689
Now let this be a lesson to everyone.

22:14.266 --> 22:17.896
<i>No matter who you are,
or how famous you become,</i>

22:18.070 --> 22:19.765
<i>justice will find you.</i>

22:25.578 --> 22:27.569
<i>We have a place for criminals.</i>

22:27.746 --> 22:30.215
<i>It's called Kryptarium.</i>

22:32.451 --> 22:34.943
One crew down.

22:36.488 --> 22:40.425
And now to get mine back.

22:58.410 --> 22:59.400
