06:12.583 --> 06:14.125
DONATE THE SPERM,
BUILD THE CRIB,

06:14.166 --> 06:16.834
AND THEN I JUST KIND OF
WANT TO BE THE FUN UNCLE--

06:16.875 --> 06:18.875
WATER FIGHTS
AND MOVIE NIGHTS,

06:18.917 --> 06:20.125
NO DIAPERS.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.125
WHICH IS GREAT, BECAUSE I'LL
BE HOME WITH THE BABY.

06:22.166 --> 06:23.333
ROSIE WORKS, SO...

06:23.375 --> 06:25.750
AND THOSE ROLES
ARE GREAT FOR NOW,

06:25.792 --> 06:28.041
BUT AS A BABY GROWS,
THINGS DO CHANGE.

06:28.083 --> 06:31.000
PROBLEMS COME UP,
ARGUMENTS HAPPEN,

06:31.041 --> 06:33.834
AND IF EVAN DISAGREES WITH
ANY OF YOUR PARENTING CHOICES,

06:33.875 --> 06:36.208
HE WOULD,
AS THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

06:36.250 --> 06:37.625
HAVE LEGAL STANDING

06:37.667 --> 06:39.041
UNLESS YOU
SPECIFY OTHERWISE NOW.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.166
LIKE IN A CONTRACT?

06:40.208 --> 06:42.166
YEAH. WELL,
IN MOST SITUATIONS,

06:42.208 --> 06:43.417
A CONTRACT
IS NOT A BAD IDEA.

06:43.458 --> 06:45.000
(Evan)
WHAT WOULD IT SAY,

06:45.041 --> 06:47.041
THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT
TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE BABY?

06:47.083 --> 06:48.166
IT CAN SAY
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.166
IT'S JUST A FORMALITY.

06:50.208 --> 06:52.667

06:52.709 --> 06:55.166

07:00.083 --> 07:01.834

07:01.875 --> 07:03.875

07:03.917 --> 07:05.834

07:07.125 --> 07:08.750

07:08.792 --> 07:09.959
COME ON, ROSE.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.041

07:12.166 --> 07:13.625

07:13.667 --> 07:16.500
THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT I
HAVEN'T SEEN OR HEARD.

07:16.542 --> 07:19.208
AND THIS IS NOT A PLACE
OF JUDGMENT.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.083
BUT GETTING WHAT YOU WANT

07:21.125 --> 07:23.667
HAS TO START
WITH THE TRUTH.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.125

07:41.375 --> 07:44.583

WHATCHA DOIN'?

07:46.083 --> 07:47.125
OH, I'M JUST TRYING

07:47.166 --> 07:49.125
TO MAXIMIZE MY TEN MINUTES
BETWEEN PATIENTS.

07:49.166 --> 07:52.041
I GOT KINDA
JAMMED UP TODAY.

07:52.083 --> 07:53.500
FEEL LIKE TAKING A BREAK
AT LUNCH

07:53.542 --> 07:55.166
FOR PIZZA AND PINS?

07:55.208 --> 07:56.750
GREASY SLICES,

07:56.792 --> 07:58.500
SLIPPERY BOWLING BALLS,
MY TREAT.

07:58.542 --> 08:00.667
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN,
BUT I DON'T KNOW

08:00.709 --> 08:02.792
IF MY DIGESTIVE TRACK
COULD HANDLE IT,

08:02.834 --> 08:05.041
PLUS, UH...
I HATE PUTTING ON SHOES

08:05.083 --> 08:08.000
THAT A HUNDRED OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE WORN BEFORE ME, YOU KNOW--

08:08.041 --> 08:09.417
OH, COME ON.
IT'LL BE FUN.

08:09.458 --> 08:12.083
I'LL EVEN BUY
THE PEPTO AND PURELL.

08:12.125 --> 08:15.000
THANKS, BUT, UH...
MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME.

08:17.667 --> 08:19.417
(people speaking indistinctly)

08:19.458 --> 08:21.583
HEY. I WAS
JUST LOOKING FOR YOU.

08:21.625 --> 08:23.291

08:23.333 --> 08:24.500
YOU BUSY TODAY?

08:24.542 --> 08:26.041
I'M PRETTY MUCH
CAUGHT UP ON MY CHARTS.

08:26.083 --> 08:27.500
A COUPLE OF PATIENTS
ARE COMING IN--

08:27.542 --> 08:29.834
ARE YOU READY
TO CUT AGAIN?

08:29.875 --> 08:31.291
A PATIENT WITH
AN OBSTRUCTIVE NEUROSARCOID

08:31.333 --> 08:33.083
WAS SCHEDULED
FOR THIS AFTERNOON,

08:33.125 --> 08:35.041
BUT BUDDLE'S COMING OFF
AN ALL-NIGHTER,

08:35.083 --> 08:37.041
AND I NEED SOMEONE.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.625
WELL, I THOUGHT I MIGHT
ASSIST A FEW BEFORE I--

08:38.667 --> 08:40.208
EITHER YOU'RE READY TO COME
BACK TO THE HOSPITAL AND WORK

08:40.250 --> 08:41.667
OR YOU'RE NOT.

08:43.625 --> 08:46.000
I'M READY.

08:46.041 --> 08:47.750
I'M DEFINITELY READY.

08:47.792 --> 08:49.000
GOOD.

08:54.417 --> 08:56.041
WE KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.000
I UNDERSTAND BEING IN LOVE.
I'M NOT JUDGING.

08:58.041 --> 08:59.750
YOU ARE.
EVERYONE JUDGES US.

08:59.792 --> 09:02.750
BUT WE APPRECIATE HOW HARD
YOU'RE TRYING NOT TO.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.166
(laughs) OKAY.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.667
WELL, TELL ME
ABOUT YOURSELVES.

09:06.709 --> 09:08.166
THE FIRST NIGHT WAS...

09:08.208 --> 09:09.458
IT WAS AMAZING.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.959
THE FIRST NIGHT
USUALLY IS.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.041
BUT SO WAS THE NEXT MORNING.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.792
AND EVERY MORNING
AFTER THAT.

09:13.834 --> 09:14.875
MOST MORNINGS.

09:14.917 --> 09:16.417
IT--IT SOUNDS VERY EASY.

09:16.458 --> 09:18.375
IT'S NOT.
WE HAVE RULES.

09:18.417 --> 09:20.625
EVERY DECISION
HAS TO BE UNANIMOUS.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.000
WE HAVE TO AVOID
THE TWO AGAINST ONE

09:22.041 --> 09:24.083
SO NO ONE FEELS
GANGED UP ON.
OKAY.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.041
Y-YOU ARE
TALKING ABOUT THINGS

09:26.083 --> 09:29.041
THAT ARE IN THE CONTEXT
OF THE RELATIONSHIP.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.250
BUT THERE IS A WORLD
OUT THERE,

09:31.291 --> 09:34.083
THE WORLD THAT YOU WOULD BE
RAISING YOUR CHILD IN.

09:34.125 --> 09:36.250
AND THAT WORLD
IS NOT QUITE AS ACCEPTING

09:36.291 --> 09:37.500
ABOUT THINGS
THAT DON'T APPEAR--

09:37.542 --> 09:39.500
NORMAL?

09:39.542 --> 09:42.166
I COME FROM A HOME WHERE THERE
WASN'T A LOT OF LOVE.

09:42.208 --> 09:44.250
THERE WAS A LOT OF...

09:44.291 --> 09:45.458
COMMITMENT--

09:45.500 --> 09:47.291
35 YEARS OF MARRIAGE--

09:47.333 --> 09:49.542
AND A LOT OF WHAT PEOPLE
CALL NORMAL,

09:49.583 --> 09:51.417
BUT NOT MUCH LOVE.

09:51.458 --> 09:54.000
KENDRA AND ROSE AND ME...

09:57.667 --> 10:00.000
THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE HERE.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.041
A-A WHAT?

10:03.083 --> 10:04.417
A POLYAMOROUS TRIAD.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.458
THREE PEOPLE IN A COMMITTED,
MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.041
I CAN BARELY KEEP UP
WITH ONE PARTNER.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.625
I CAN'T IMAGINE
TRYING TO SATISFY TWO.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.834
THERE'S NO WAY THAT WORKS.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.083
EVERY COUPLE, OR TRIAD,
IS DIFFERENT.

10:13.125 --> 10:14.667
YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN'T GENERALIZE.

10:14.709 --> 10:16.208
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY ARE.
THEY LIED TO ME.

10:16.250 --> 10:17.834
(Violet) WELL, BECAUSE THEIR
LIFESTYLE'S UNCONVENTIONAL,

10:17.875 --> 10:19.959
THEY'RE PROBABLY USED TO
BEING CRITICIZED AND MOCKED--

10:20.000 --> 10:21.208
(Addison)
FOR GOOD REASON.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.291
I MEAN, HEY, CAN WE JUST PAUSE
THE MORAL AND ETHICAL DEBATE

10:23.333 --> 10:25.959
AND CRITICIZE AND MOCK THEM
FOR A MINUTE?
(laughs)

10:26.000 --> 10:27.166
(Sam) IT'S JUST WEIRD.

10:27.208 --> 10:28.542
IT'S WEIRD.

10:28.583 --> 10:29.959
FOUR BOOBS, TWO GEEGERS...
(Violet and Addison laugh)

10:30.000 --> 10:31.792
IT'S NOT WEIRD.
IT'S FANTASTIC.

10:31.834 --> 10:33.041
WOW.
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:33.083 --> 10:34.333
YOU JUST BROUGHT IT
TO A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL.

10:34.375 --> 10:36.041
YEP.
LIFE IS ALREADY SO DIFFICULT.
WHY MAKE IT HARDER?

10:36.083 --> 10:37.125
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
THE SAME ARGUMENT

10:37.166 --> 10:38.750
THAT SAID THAT INTERRACIAL

10:38.792 --> 10:40.583
AND SAME-SEX COUPLES
SHOULDN'T HAVE CHILDREN.

10:40.625 --> 10:42.959
HEY, I WAS READY TO HELP OUT
AN HONEST LESBIAN COUPLE.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.375
SO WAIT.
IS IT THE DISHONESTY

10:44.417 --> 10:46.333
OR THE POLYAMORY
THAT YOU TAKE ISSUE WITH?

10:46.375 --> 10:47.542
THE LYING.

10:47.583 --> 10:48.750
OKAY, WELL,
SEPARATE THAT OUT.

10:48.792 --> 10:50.041
THESE PEOPLE
ARE IN A TOUGH SPOT.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.917
SOCIETY IS NOT READY
FOR THEM.

10:51.959 --> 10:53.458
OH, ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT
THIS? SAM IS RIGHT.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.709
(cell phone rings)
IT IS JUST PLAIN WEIRD.

10:54.750 --> 10:55.959
THANK YOU, BABY.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.083
ADDISON MONTGOMERY.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.417
REALLY?

10:59.458 --> 11:01.041
IS SHE...

11:01.083 --> 11:04.041
UH, YES, YES, I DO.
A-ABSOLUTELY, I DO.

11:04.083 --> 11:05.917
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD-BYE.

11:05.959 --> 11:07.041
UH...
(beeps)

11:07.083 --> 11:08.417
THAT WAS MY LAWYER,

11:08.458 --> 11:11.041
AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT I
MISLED AND SLIGHTLY FIBBED TO

11:11.083 --> 11:12.291
THE SOCIAL WORKER,
SHE SIGNED OFF,

11:12.333 --> 11:14.375
AND A BIRTH MOTHER
WANTS TO MEET ME.

11:14.417 --> 11:15.792
(Violet) WOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:15.834 --> 11:17.125
IN A LOT OF PLACES,
A SINGLE WHITE WOMAN

11:17.166 --> 11:19.083
LIVING WITH A SINGLE BLACK MAN
WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE

11:19.125 --> 11:20.625
THE EX-HUSBAND
OF HER BEST FRIEND...

11:20.667 --> 11:22.041
OH, MY...
(Sam) OH, WOW.

11:22.083 --> 11:23.291
(Sheldon) TRYING TO ADOPT
A CHILD OUT OF WEDLOCK

11:23.333 --> 11:24.709
WITHOUT THE INTEREST
OF HER BOYFRIEND...
COME ON.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.166
WOULD SEEM
JUST PLAIN WEIRD.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.709
OKAY, FINE.
I TAKE BACK THE WEIRD.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.125
THE TRIAD HAS ALL MY SUPPORT.

11:29.166 --> 11:32.250
IN LESS THAN A MONTH,
I COULD BE A MOTHER.

11:33.917 --> 11:35.000
(laughs)

11:38.250 --> 11:40.041
HEY, YOU FEELIN' OKAY?

11:40.083 --> 11:42.458
YES.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.583
YOU SURE?
YOU WANT TO TALK?

11:44.625 --> 11:46.041
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS

11:46.083 --> 11:48.166
ABOUT MEETING
THE BIRTH MOTHER, YOU KNOW?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.417
SO, YES, I WOULD LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT I'M...

11:50.458 --> 11:52.041
PRETTY SURE YOU DON'T.

11:52.083 --> 11:53.583
NOT ABOUT THAT.

11:54.917 --> 11:56.750
WELL...

11:56.792 --> 11:58.500
GOOD LUCK.

12:00.083 --> 12:02.000
YOU'RE GREAT.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.291
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

12:10.208 --> 12:11.625
(exhales)

12:11.667 --> 12:13.041
HOW ARE YOU AT...

12:13.083 --> 12:14.083
FORGIVING?

12:14.125 --> 12:15.792
I MEAN,
IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.041
I KNOW WE PREACH IT,

12:17.083 --> 12:19.000
BUT... CAN YOU DO IT?

12:19.041 --> 12:20.500
SOMETIMES.

12:20.542 --> 12:21.709
WHEN?

12:21.750 --> 12:24.500
WH-WHEN THE RELATIONSHIP
IS WORTH SAVING.

12:24.542 --> 12:25.709
WE TALKING ABOUT AMELIA?

12:25.750 --> 12:27.041
(inhales deeply)

12:27.083 --> 12:29.875
NO. WE'RE--WE'RE JUST
TALKING ABOUT FORGIVENESS.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.208
OH. (chuckles)

12:31.250 --> 12:32.417
OKAY.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.041
WELL, UH,
I GUESS IT WOULD DEPEND

12:34.083 --> 12:35.709
ON WHAT THE OFFENSE IS.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.125
SHE CRUSHED ME.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.875
YEAH.

12:41.917 --> 12:43.333
AND WHEN SHE WAS IN CRISIS,
WHEN SHE WAS IN REHAB,

12:43.375 --> 12:46.542
IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO
PUT ASIDE MY OWN HURT FEELINGS

12:46.583 --> 12:48.291
AND MY OWN REACTIONS,
YOU KNOW?

12:48.333 --> 12:51.625
IT WAS EASY
JUST TO WANT TO SAVE HER.

12:51.667 --> 12:54.000
BUT NOW, I, UH...

12:55.667 --> 12:57.583
I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR HER.

13:01.083 --> 13:02.917
WELL, JUST GIVE HER TIME.

13:02.959 --> 13:05.041
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING
WITH PETE?

13:05.083 --> 13:07.458
(exhales)

13:07.500 --> 13:08.625
YES.

13:08.667 --> 13:10.583
IS IT WORKING?

13:10.625 --> 13:13.333
NO.

13:16.291 --> 13:19.291
(water running without sound)

13:30.959 --> 13:34.583
(surgical team
speaking indistinctly)

13:34.625 --> 13:35.750
(door closes)

13:35.792 --> 13:37.709
DR. SHEPHERD,
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.041
WE HEARD
YOU WERE ON VACATION.

13:39.083 --> 13:40.291
DID YOU GO SOMEWHERE AMAZING?

13:40.333 --> 13:42.041
THIS ISN'T A TEA PARTY.

13:42.083 --> 13:43.959
YOU ALL HAVE A SURGERY
TO DO.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.583
DR. SHEPHERD
NEEDS TO CONCENTRATE.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.917
YOU ALL DO.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.542
LESS TALK. MORE FOCUS.

13:48.583 --> 13:52.667
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:02.667 --> 14:04.000
SCALPEL.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.750
I HAVE ONE MORE SEMESTER,

14:08.792 --> 14:12.083
THEN LAW SCHOOL.

14:12.125 --> 14:14.417
YES, PLEASE.

14:14.458 --> 14:16.750
(exhales)

14:16.792 --> 14:19.000
OOH.

14:22.208 --> 14:24.417
DO YOU THINK
I'M AN AWFUL PERSON

14:24.458 --> 14:26.250
FOR GIVING MY BABY UP?

14:26.291 --> 14:28.250
OF COURSE NOT. I--

14:28.291 --> 14:30.750
OH, PLEASE DON'T HUMOR ME.

14:30.792 --> 14:33.542
PLEASE JUST THINK ABOUT
THE QUESTION.

14:33.583 --> 14:35.250
BECAUSE I'M 20.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.875
I'M NOT A TEENAGER,

14:36.917 --> 14:39.959
AND I HAVE THE RESOURCES,
YOU KNOW?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.667
YOU KNOW,
THIS ISN'T NECESSITY.

14:41.709 --> 14:45.542
I'M NOT GIVING HER UP
OUT OF NECESSITY.

14:45.583 --> 14:48.625
I'M GIVING HER UP
BECAUSE...

14:48.667 --> 14:51.041
I DON'T WANT
TO BE A MOM AT 20.

14:51.083 --> 14:53.875
AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE HER

14:53.917 --> 14:56.917
TO ANYONE WHO THINKS
I'M AN AWFUL PERSON.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.291
I HAD AN ABORTION
WHEN I WAS IN MY 30s.

15:04.333 --> 15:08.041
I WAS ALREADY A SURGEON.
MY CAREER WAS IN PLACE.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.083
AND, UH... I CERTAINLY
HAD THE RESOURCES,

15:10.125 --> 15:13.000
BUT... I WASN'T READY.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.583
SO...

15:14.625 --> 15:16.917
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.583
OH, GOD.

15:20.625 --> 15:23.041
AND NOW I REALLY HOPE
THAT YOU'RE NOT JUDGING ME.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.750
(laughs)
I'M SORRY. I PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU THAT.

15:24.792 --> 15:26.542
OH, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT--I MEAN,
I-I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK

15:26.583 --> 15:27.750
THAT I-I--

15:27.792 --> 15:29.291
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU,
DR. MONTGOMERY.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.291
(exhales)

15:31.333 --> 15:33.125
WOW. THAT'S JUST...

15:33.166 --> 15:35.125
I'VE... NEVER MET ANYONE

15:35.166 --> 15:37.750
WHO JUST ADMITTED
TO AN ABORTION LIKE THAT.

15:37.792 --> 15:40.125
IT'S JUST THAT NO ONE
EVER TALKS ABOUT THAT STUFF.

15:40.166 --> 15:42.458
CERTAINLY NOT WHEN THEY'RE
TRYING TO IMPRESS SOMEONE.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.041
OH, NOT EVER.

15:44.083 --> 15:45.458
I MEAN...

15:45.500 --> 15:50.417
WE ALL JUST PRETEND LIKE
THAT STUFF DOESN'T EXIST.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.750
YOU'RE SORT OF AMAZING.

15:52.792 --> 15:54.667
(chuckles)

15:54.709 --> 15:56.542
SO...

15:56.583 --> 15:58.959
HAVE YOU MET WITH ANY OTHER
POTENTIAL PARENTS?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.583
WELL, THERE'S THIS FAMILY
AT MY CHURCH

16:01.625 --> 16:04.000
THAT MY MOM HAD ME MEET.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.917
AND THEY WERE NICE...

16:06.959 --> 16:08.583
BUT KIND OF BORING.

16:08.625 --> 16:11.583
YOU KNOW, THE DAD WORKS,
THE MOM STAYS HOME.

16:11.625 --> 16:14.041
THEY ALREADY HAVE
A LITTLE BOY.

16:14.083 --> 16:15.375
MM.

16:15.417 --> 16:16.792
YOU'RE A FETAL SURGEON?

16:16.834 --> 16:18.000
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

16:18.041 --> 16:19.500
THAT'S PRETTY AWESOME.

16:19.542 --> 16:20.917
THANK YOU.

16:20.959 --> 16:22.166
(laughs)

16:26.166 --> 16:28.041
REAL ESTATE LISTINGS?

16:28.083 --> 16:31.041
YEAH. VIOLET THINKS
I SHOULD FIND MY OWN PLACE.

16:31.083 --> 16:32.583
(clicking keyboard keys)

16:32.625 --> 16:34.917
WOW.

16:34.959 --> 16:36.041
I'M SORRY.

16:36.083 --> 16:37.834
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

16:37.875 --> 16:39.041
I DON'T KNOW.

16:39.083 --> 16:42.041
I DON'T WANT TO BE
A PART-TIME PARENT TO LUCAS--

16:42.083 --> 16:43.959
NOT BEING WITH HIM EVERY DAY,
MISSING...

16:44.000 --> 16:46.542
WAKE UP, BEDTIME,
BATH TIME, I...

16:46.583 --> 16:48.542
AND EVEN IF I DO GET
A PLACE THAT'S CLOSE BY,

16:48.583 --> 16:50.375
IT STILL WON'T BE
HIS HOUSE, YOU KNOW?

16:50.417 --> 16:52.834
MM-HMM. MAYA USED TO CALL
MY PLACE...

16:52.875 --> 16:54.417
"HER WEEKEND GETAWAY."

16:54.458 --> 16:56.625
UGH.
(pours liquid)

16:56.667 --> 16:58.583
IT'S TOUGH.
YOU MISS A LOT.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.041
KIDS KILL YOU.

17:00.083 --> 17:01.417
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

17:01.458 --> 17:03.542
YOU AND ADDISON?

17:03.583 --> 17:05.959
UGH. WE'RE NOT EVEN
PRETENDING ANYMORE.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.250
IT'S LIKE, UH,
I DON'T KNOW,

17:08.291 --> 17:10.375
ONE OF US
JUST HAS TO SAY THE WORDS,

17:10.417 --> 17:12.166
MAKE OFFICIAL WHAT WE...

17:12.208 --> 17:13.792
BOTH ALREADY KNOW.

17:13.834 --> 17:15.792
YEAH, WELL,
BEFORE YOU SAY THE WORDS,

17:15.834 --> 17:17.458
JUST...

17:17.500 --> 17:19.000
BE SURE.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.458
IN A FEW MONTHS, I COULD HAVE
A SON ON THAT SCREEN.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.041
OR A DAUGHTER.
(Rose) HEALTHY BABY.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.250
GENDER IRRELEVANT.
COME ON, GUYS.

17:28.291 --> 17:29.458
ROSE IS RIGHT.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.667
OKAY, KENDRA, I'M ALL DONE.

17:30.709 --> 17:34.083
ROSE,
YOU WANT TO HOP UP HERE?

17:38.125 --> 17:39.291
WHAT?

17:39.333 --> 17:41.792
NO, NOTHING.
IT--IT'S SWEET,

17:41.834 --> 17:43.375
THE WAY YOU ALL GET ALONG
SO WELL.

17:43.417 --> 17:44.709
SEEMS LIKE
IT WOULD BE TRICKY.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.041
HE WANTS TO KNOW
ABOUT THE SEX.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.458
NO.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.834
(Rose) IT'S OKAY.
EVERYONE DOES.
(Evan laughs)

17:48.875 --> 17:51.041
(Kendra) WE HAVE ONE BED--
CALIFORNIA KING.

17:51.083 --> 17:52.041
THAT'S ENOUGH, KENDRA.

17:52.083 --> 17:54.750
DR. MONTGOMERY,
WHAT IS IT?

17:58.041 --> 18:01.166
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HE WOULD DO THIS?

18:01.208 --> 18:03.875
BECAUSE HE'S 8.
BECAUSE HE WANTED THE CARDS.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.166
BECAUSE HE'S TESTING YOU.

18:05.208 --> 18:06.458
I DON'T KNOW.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.041
COOPER, IF A PARENT COMES IN

18:08.083 --> 18:10.542
AND TELLS YOU THAT
THEIR KID STOLE SOMETHING,

18:10.583 --> 18:12.083
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

18:14.083 --> 18:15.250
I WOULD ASK
IF THERE HAD BEEN

18:15.291 --> 18:16.875
ANY OTHER
TROUBLING BEHAVIOR RECENTLY.

18:16.917 --> 18:18.083
HAS THERE BEEN WITH MASON?

18:18.125 --> 18:20.208
NO, BUT--
THEN WHAT ELSE
DO YOU ASK 'EM?

18:20.250 --> 18:22.208
IF THERE HAD BEEN
ANY PROBLEMS AT HOME

18:22.250 --> 18:24.125
THAT THE KID
COULD BE REACTING TO.

18:24.166 --> 18:25.542
THAT THE CASE WITH MASON?

18:25.583 --> 18:27.041
I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

18:27.083 --> 18:28.250
SO THEN WHAT?

18:28.291 --> 18:29.875
A KID WITH NO BIG PROBLEMS

18:29.917 --> 18:32.333
SWIPES SOMETHING FROM
A TOY STORE, OUT OF THE BLUE.

18:32.375 --> 18:33.959
WHAT DO YOU TELL
THE PARENTS TO DO?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.250
IT'S JUST...

18:36.291 --> 18:38.500
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE...
(chuckles)

18:38.542 --> 18:40.083
NOT WITH MY OWN KID.

18:40.125 --> 18:42.333
IT'S DIFFERENT.

18:42.375 --> 18:44.375
(sighs)

18:44.417 --> 18:46.166
(Jake) SO, ROSE, I'M AFRAID

18:46.208 --> 18:49.000
THAT, UH... (clears throat)

18:49.041 --> 18:50.750
YOU HAVE A SCARRED UTERUS

18:50.792 --> 18:54.583
AND OVARIAN FAILURE
SECONDARY TO PELVIC T.B.

18:54.625 --> 18:57.083
TUBERCULOSIS?

18:57.125 --> 18:58.709
I'M NOT SICK.

18:58.750 --> 19:01.375
NO, YOU'RE NOT. IT'S,
UH... IT'S NOT ACTIVE.

19:01.417 --> 19:03.041
BUT IF YOU'VE SPENT ANY TIME
AT ALL IN SOUTH AMERICA

19:03.083 --> 19:04.166
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS--

19:04.208 --> 19:06.041
(Kendra) SHE TAUGHT E.S.L.
IN CHILE AFTER COLLEGE.

19:06.083 --> 19:08.041
(Evan)
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

19:08.083 --> 19:09.959
UNFORTUNATELY, ROSE'S BODY
IS INCAPABLE

19:10.000 --> 19:11.583
OF PRODUCING VIABLE EGGS

19:11.625 --> 19:14.166
OR CARRYING A FETUS.

19:18.667 --> 19:21.041
I AM SO SORRY, ROSIE.

19:21.083 --> 19:24.041
BUT, UM, WE CAN STILL
HAVE A FAMILY, RIGHT?

19:24.083 --> 19:25.208
(Jake) YES, IN FACT,

19:25.250 --> 19:28.041
KENDRA'S TESTS ALL CAME BACK
PERFECTLY NORMAL.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.417
SO IF EVAN AND--AND KENDRA
WERE TO TRY TO CONCEIVE,

19:30.458 --> 19:32.041
THEY MIGHT NOT
EVEN NEED I.V.F.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.417
WHAT?

19:33.458 --> 19:35.291
WHAT ABOUT ME?

19:35.333 --> 19:36.709
ROSIE,
YOU'D BE THE MOM, TOO.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.709
THIS WOULD BE OUR CHILD.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.333
NO, THIS WOULD BE
YOUR CHILD WITH EVAN.

19:40.375 --> 19:41.792
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

19:41.834 --> 19:44.291
WELL, I-IN MY EXPERIENCE,
ONCE THE BABY SHOWS UP--

19:44.333 --> 19:46.917
NO, THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS
WAS TO HAVE A BABY TOGETHER

19:46.959 --> 19:48.750
SO THAT WE COULD ALL BE
A PART OF THE EXPERIENCE.

19:48.792 --> 19:50.000
DR. REILLY IS RIGHT.

19:50.041 --> 19:51.417
IF THE THREE OF YOU
REALLY WANT A BABY,

19:51.458 --> 19:53.041
NO MATTER
WHERE IT COMES FROM--

19:53.083 --> 19:55.333
IF I CAN'T BE A PART OF THIS,

19:55.375 --> 19:57.417
WE'RE NOT DOING IT.

19:57.458 --> 19:59.041
ROSE, YOU YOURSELF SAID,

19:59.083 --> 20:00.875
THE THREE OF YOU
COULD HANDLE ANYTHING.

20:00.917 --> 20:03.125
WE ARE HANDLING IT.

20:03.166 --> 20:06.041
WE'RE JUST...

20:06.083 --> 20:08.041
WE'RE JUST NOT HAVING
A BABY.

20:16.625 --> 20:18.041
I'M SAYING THAT,
IN A TWO-PARTY RELATIONSHIP,

20:18.083 --> 20:19.375
BOTH PARTIES HAVE TO AGREE
IN ORDER TO HAVE THE BABY.

20:19.417 --> 20:21.208
WELL, THE SAME RULES APPLY
IN THE TRIAD.

20:21.250 --> 20:23.041
ALL DECISIONS ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE UNANIMOUS.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.208
WELL, THIS ONE
CLEARLY ISN'T.

20:25.250 --> 20:26.667
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
ONE OF THEM CAN LEAVE.

20:26.709 --> 20:28.041
I MEAN, THEY SAY
THEY'RE A FAMILY, RIGHT?

20:28.083 --> 20:30.041
WELL, FAMILIES DON'T ALWAYS
STAY TOGETHER.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.709
LOOK, THE--THE TRUTH IS

20:31.750 --> 20:34.041
THAT KENDRA AND ROSE AND EVAN
ARE NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM US.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.667
THEY WANT TO STAY TOGETHER,
THEY WANT TO WORK IT OUT,

20:35.709 --> 20:37.041
AND THIS IS JUST AN OBSTACLE.

20:37.083 --> 20:39.625
WELL, FOR MOST COUPLES,
HAVING OR NOT HAVING A BABY,

20:39.667 --> 20:41.208
IT'S NOT AN OBSTACLE,
IT'S A DEAL BREAKER.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.917
THAT'S BECAUSE HAVING A BABY
IS NOT RATIONAL.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.041
SAM.

20:44.083 --> 20:45.875
WHAT? I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S IRRATIONAL.

20:45.917 --> 20:47.041
I'M JUST SAYING,
IT'S INSTINCTIVE.

20:47.083 --> 20:49.667
YOU KNOW, IT'S HORMONAL.
IT'S BIOLOGICAL.

20:49.709 --> 20:52.041
BUT WANTING ONE--YOU EITHER
DO OR YOU DON'T.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.834
LOOK, YOU GAVE THEM A PIECE
OF DEVASTATING NEWS.

20:54.875 --> 20:57.709
THEY NEED TIME
TO PROCESS IT.

20:57.750 --> 21:01.417
HOPEFULLY, THEIR RELATIONSHIP
IS STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERCOME IT.

21:01.458 --> 21:05.291

21:05.333 --> 21:07.458

24:47.583 --> 24:48.750
OH.
LOOK AT ME.

24:48.792 --> 24:49.959
PUSH.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.500
(screaming)

24:51.542 --> 24:54.000
GOOD. GOOD.
THERE'S THE HEAD.

24:54.041 --> 24:55.041
AAH!

24:55.083 --> 24:56.625
YOU GOT THIS, MELANIE.

24:56.667 --> 24:58.041
SHE'S COMING.

24:58.083 --> 24:59.417
(whimpers)

24:59.458 --> 25:00.709
GOOD. (chuckles)

25:00.750 --> 25:02.041
(baby crying)

25:02.083 --> 25:03.041
HERE SHE IS.

25:03.083 --> 25:04.291
(panting)

25:04.333 --> 25:05.417
(laughs)

25:05.458 --> 25:08.417
SHE'S PERFECT, MELANIE.

25:08.458 --> 25:09.834
(baby continues crying)

25:09.875 --> 25:11.625
SHE'S PERFECT.

25:11.667 --> 25:14.375
OHH. (laughs)

25:14.417 --> 25:16.291
(knock on door)
HEY.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.041
HEY.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.375
OKAY, YOU'RE A DAD.

25:19.417 --> 25:20.834
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

25:20.875 --> 25:23.208
YEAH, I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE OTHER THINGS RIGHT NOW.

25:23.250 --> 25:24.417
MASON...

25:24.458 --> 25:27.792
STOLE A PACK OF CARDS
FROM THE TOY STORE.

25:30.083 --> 25:31.875
OKAY. YOU DO SEE
I'M WORKING HERE?

25:31.917 --> 25:35.041
OH, COME ON, SAM. THIS IS
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

25:35.083 --> 25:36.417
OKAY.

25:38.417 --> 25:40.834
SO, UH...
I DON'T KNOW.

25:40.875 --> 25:42.750
PUNISH HIM AND MOVE ON.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.458
NO, I DON'T--I DON'T THINK
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

25:44.500 --> 25:48.041
I THINK... I THINK MAYBE I
SHOULD STAY THE GOOD GUY.

25:48.083 --> 25:51.041
I MEAN, I THINK I SHOULD
SPECIFICALLY BE THE PARENT

25:51.083 --> 25:53.375
THAT DOESN'T PUNISH HIM.

25:53.417 --> 25:55.041
NO, HOLD--THINK ABOUT IT.

25:55.083 --> 25:56.458
ERICA'S BEEN THERE
FROM THE BEGINNING.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.834
SHE ALREADY DOES THE DISCIPLINE.
HE EXPECTS IT.

25:58.875 --> 26:00.041
OKAY.

26:00.083 --> 26:01.709
IF I COULD BE THE PERSON
THAT MASON COULD COME TO

26:01.750 --> 26:03.041
NO MATTER HOW BADLY
HE SCREWS UP,

26:03.083 --> 26:05.083
HE COULD SAY WHAT HAPPENED,
I COULD HELP HIM FIX IT...

26:05.125 --> 26:07.041
I MEAN, IMAGINE HAVING THAT
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP.

26:07.083 --> 26:08.458
HOW GREAT
WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN?

26:08.500 --> 26:09.792
AMAZING.
RIGHT?

26:09.834 --> 26:12.041
YEAH. YOU C--YOU COULD TOTALLY
BE THAT GUY, COOP.

26:12.083 --> 26:14.375
OR, UH, YOU COULD BE
MASON'S DAD.

26:14.417 --> 26:16.583
I MEAN, BEING A PARENT,
LIKE, A REAL PARENT,

26:16.625 --> 26:18.041
DAY IN, DAY OUT,

26:18.083 --> 26:21.041
TRYING TO MAKE SURE YOUR KID
TURNS OUT OKAY, IT'S HARD, MAN.

26:21.083 --> 26:23.417
YOU GOTTA SAY "NO" A LOT.
YOU GOTTA HEAR "I HATE YOU."

26:23.458 --> 26:27.083
YOU GOTTA GIVE UP FUN TIMES
TO--TO REINFORCE VALUES

26:27.125 --> 26:28.709
THAT YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.250
IT'S...

26:30.291 --> 26:32.208
IT IS THE HARDEST THING
IN THE WORLD.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.834
SO...

26:33.875 --> 26:36.166
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
IT'S UP TO YOU.

26:39.750 --> 26:42.041
(Evan) I GET THAT SHE'S UPSET,
BUT THIS IS...

26:42.083 --> 26:44.917
(inhales deeply)
IT'S WRONG.

26:44.959 --> 26:48.041
SHE JUST FOUND OUT THAT SHE
CAN'T BE A MOM BIOLOGICALLY.

26:48.083 --> 26:49.834
I MEAN, THAT'S GONNA TAKE
SOME TIME.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.667
I'M SURE PART OF IT IS
ROSE'S CONCERN ABOUT THE BABY.

26:52.709 --> 26:55.041
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
SHE'S ALSO CONCERNED

26:55.083 --> 26:57.500
ABOUT WHAT THIS MIGHT DO
TO THE THREE OF YOU?

26:57.542 --> 26:58.750
IN WHAT SENSE?

26:58.792 --> 27:00.333
WELL, THAT THE TWO OF YOU
MIGHT SHARE A BOND

27:00.375 --> 27:03.333
THAT SHE'S NOT,
THAT SHE CAN'T BE, A PART OF.

27:03.375 --> 27:05.333
NO, THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.

27:05.375 --> 27:06.333
EVER.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.750
IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.041
YOU TWO ARE HERE
WITHOUT HER.

27:09.083 --> 27:10.542
BUT WE'RE TRYING
TO FIX IT.

27:10.583 --> 27:13.000
I MEAN, WE WANT...
TO FIX IT.

27:13.041 --> 27:14.375
OKAY.

27:14.417 --> 27:16.125
ARE YOU WILLING
TO COMPROMISE?

27:16.166 --> 27:17.375
(sighs)

27:17.417 --> 27:19.583
IF THERE WAS SOME WAY
WE COULD REASSURE ROSE,

27:19.625 --> 27:24.166
MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE
DOING THIS FOR THE THREE OF US.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.583
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TOLD ME,

27:26.625 --> 27:29.250
THIS RELATIONSHIP WORKS
BECAUSE OF THE RULES.

27:29.291 --> 27:32.375
ALL DECISIONS
HAVE TO BE UNANIMOUS.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.041
(Jenny O's "I'm Gonna
Love You Too" playing)

27:36.083 --> 27:37.917
NO, AMELIA STARTED IT.
SHE CAME ON TO ME.

27:37.959 --> 27:39.750
AIM FOR THE TARGET,
SHELDON.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.834
AND THEN JUST WHEN I STARTED
FEELING SOMETHING...

27:41.875 --> 27:43.709
ENTER RYAN.

27:43.750 --> 27:45.500
(sighs) REMEMBER TO USE
YOUR LEFT HAND

27:45.542 --> 27:47.625
TO STEADY YOUR RIGHT.

27:47.667 --> 27:48.834
AND I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.709
I MEAN, SHE LOVED HIM,
AND HE DIED.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.417
AND I KNOW SHE FEELS BAD
ABOUT HUMILIATING ME.

27:53.458 --> 27:55.709
I-I... I DON'T KNOW. I...
WHY CAN'T I FORGIVE HER?

27:55.750 --> 27:58.041
PULL THE TRIGGER, SHELDON.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.500
HOLY HELL, THAT FELT GOOD.

28:06.542 --> 28:07.834
YEP.

28:07.875 --> 28:09.333
SHOOT THE TARGET,
LET IT ALL OUT THERE,

28:09.375 --> 28:11.333
'CAUSE I CAN PRETTY WELL

28:16.083 --> 28:18.125

(people speaking indistinctly)

28:51.125 --> 28:52.291
HEY.

28:52.333 --> 28:54.417
MORNING.

28:54.458 --> 28:56.041
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HAND?

28:56.083 --> 28:58.917
AH, I STRAINED IT
AT THE SHOOTING RANGE.

28:58.959 --> 29:00.750
THE SHOOTING RANGE,
REALLY?

29:00.792 --> 29:02.083
IT MIGHT BE
MY NEW HOBBY.

29:02.125 --> 29:03.291
(liquid pours)

29:03.333 --> 29:05.375
THAT...
SOUNDS KIND OF FUN.

29:05.417 --> 29:08.041
COULD I...
COULD I GO SOMETIME?

29:08.083 --> 29:09.166
(inhales deeply)

29:09.208 --> 29:10.500
UH, NO.

29:10.542 --> 29:12.709
I MEAN, JUST, UH...

29:12.750 --> 29:15.083
NOT ANY TIME REALLY SOON.

29:15.125 --> 29:16.750
YOU UNDERSTAND?

29:17.959 --> 29:19.250
I UNDERSTAND.

29:25.375 --> 29:27.834
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN
BE DONE TO...

29:27.875 --> 29:29.875
(inhales deeply) FIX ME?

29:29.917 --> 29:31.875
ROSE, YOU--
YOU AREN'T BROKEN.

29:31.917 --> 29:33.750
I KNOW IT FEELS THAT WAY,

29:33.792 --> 29:35.834
BUT... THERE ARE
SO MANY WOMEN

29:35.875 --> 29:38.041
WHO HAVE COME TO ME,
UNABLE TO CONCEIVE,

29:38.083 --> 29:42.959
AND... YET WE STILL FIND
A WAY TO MAKE THEM MOTHERS.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.417
ARE YOU A FATHER?

29:44.458 --> 29:46.750
YES, I AM,
NOT BIOLOGICALLY,

29:46.792 --> 29:48.625
BUT REGARDLESS,
THE LOVE I FEEL--

29:48.667 --> 29:51.291
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEM.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.041
WHAT IF A BABY
CHANGES EVERYTHING?

29:55.083 --> 29:57.333
IF THE LOVE IS REAL,

29:57.375 --> 29:59.125
IT CAN WITHSTAND ANYTHING.

29:59.166 --> 30:01.333
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

30:03.792 --> 30:05.000
NO.

30:07.083 --> 30:08.542
NO, I...

30:08.583 --> 30:10.041
(sighs)

30:10.083 --> 30:13.291
I THINK LOVE
IS A POWERFUL FORCE.

30:13.333 --> 30:17.166
IT PUTS UP A HELL OF A FIGHT,
BUT, UH...

30:17.208 --> 30:20.667
SOMETIMES LIFE RISES UP
AND WINS.

30:20.709 --> 30:23.291
THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF...

30:23.333 --> 30:26.041
THAT ME BEING INFERTILE...

30:26.083 --> 30:29.667
THAT'S GONNA BE
LIFE WINNING.

30:31.333 --> 30:33.041
(Mason) SO DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN FINISH EARLY

30:33.083 --> 30:35.041
SO WE CAN GO TO THE PIER?

30:35.083 --> 30:37.333
UH, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO THE PIER TODAY.

30:37.375 --> 30:38.625
REALLY?

30:38.667 --> 30:40.041
REALLY.

30:40.083 --> 30:43.166
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU,
SO...

30:46.083 --> 30:47.583
(sighs)

30:47.625 --> 30:49.291
I SAW YOU STEAL
THAT PACK OF CARDS

30:49.333 --> 30:51.625
FROM THE TOY STORE.
BUT I D--

30:51.667 --> 30:53.625
DON'T EVEN START TO TELL ME
THAT YOU DIDN'T,

30:53.667 --> 30:56.542
BECAUSE... I SAW YOU.

30:58.083 --> 30:59.041
I WANT TO CALL MY MOM.

30:59.083 --> 31:00.333
JUST SIT DOWN

31:00.375 --> 31:02.041
AND YOU'RE GONNA
LISTEN TO ME, OKAY?

31:02.083 --> 31:03.125
SAYS WHO?

31:03.166 --> 31:04.750
SAYS ME.
I'M YOUR FATHER.

31:04.792 --> 31:06.208
NO.

31:06.250 --> 31:09.500
YOU'RE JUST THE GUY
WHO GOT MY MOM PREGNANT.

31:11.041 --> 31:13.041
OKAY,
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS NEXT--

31:13.083 --> 31:14.875
TOMORROW AFTER SCHOOL,
I'M GONNA PICK YOU UP,

31:14.917 --> 31:16.667
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU
TO THE TOY STORE,

31:16.709 --> 31:17.875
AND YOU'RE GONNA APOLOGIZE
TO THE OWNER.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.041
I AM NOT GONNA--

31:19.083 --> 31:20.250
YOU'RE GONNA APOLOGIZE
TO THE OWNER.

31:20.291 --> 31:22.041
THEN I'M GONNA TAKE YOU HOME.

31:22.083 --> 31:24.041
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO YOUR ROOM
AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

31:24.083 --> 31:27.667
AND YOU'RE GONNA STAY IN THERE
TILL IT'S TIME TO GO TO BED,

31:27.709 --> 31:30.875
AND IT'S GONNA BE LIKE THAT
FOR A WEEK.

31:30.917 --> 31:33.500
YOU THINK MY MOM'S
GONNA GO ALONG WITH THIS?

31:33.542 --> 31:35.917
I KNOW SHE WILL.

31:35.959 --> 31:38.291
BUT... WHAT ABOUT
THE WEEKEND?

31:38.333 --> 31:40.041
ARE WE STILL GONNA GO
TO THE MOVIES?

31:40.083 --> 31:42.000
NO, THE MOVIES ARE OUT.

31:43.750 --> 31:47.000
BUT... AM I EVEN
GONNA SEE YOU?

31:48.667 --> 31:50.041
OF COURSE.

31:50.083 --> 31:53.417
I AM NEVER GOING AWAY.

31:55.125 --> 31:56.959
OKAY?

31:59.208 --> 32:02.333
(indistinct conversations)

32:06.041 --> 32:08.333
I WANT A BABY.

32:08.375 --> 32:12.333
JUST... NOT THIS WAY.

32:13.667 --> 32:15.041
BUT I LOVE YOU GUYS

32:15.083 --> 32:16.959
SO I GUESS I'LL DO IT.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.041
YOU TWO CAN MAKE OUR BABY,

32:19.083 --> 32:21.667
AND I WILL
JUST HAVE TO TRUST US.

32:21.709 --> 32:23.041
(Evan) THANK YOU, ROSE.

32:23.083 --> 32:25.458
THANK YOU.

32:25.500 --> 32:28.041
NO.

32:28.083 --> 32:30.625
I CAN'T DO THAT.

32:30.667 --> 32:32.208
I REALLY WANT A BABY, TOO,

32:32.250 --> 32:33.917
BUT THE REASON WE WORK
IS THE RULES.

32:33.959 --> 32:35.083
WE NEED RULES.

32:35.125 --> 32:37.083
WE NEED UNANIMOUS
OR SOMEONE'S GONNA GET HURT,

32:37.125 --> 32:39.291
AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT HAPPEN.

32:39.333 --> 32:42.125
SO WE CAN USE A SURROGATE

32:42.166 --> 32:44.000
OR ADOPT
OR NOT HAVE A BABY AT ALL,

32:44.041 --> 32:46.500
BUT... GIVEN THE CHOICE,
I CHOOSE YOU.

32:46.542 --> 32:47.792
I CHOOSE THE THREE OF US.

32:47.834 --> 32:50.166
THIS IS CRAZY.
THIS ISN'T SOME LITTLE THING.

32:50.208 --> 32:53.333
THIS IS... NOT TRIVIAL.

32:53.375 --> 32:55.000
I WANT A CHILD...

32:55.041 --> 32:56.917
MY CHILD.

32:56.959 --> 32:58.125
EVAN...

32:58.166 --> 33:00.000
I LOVE YOU, BOTH OF YOU,

33:00.041 --> 33:02.041
BUT...

33:03.834 --> 33:06.333
I'M NOT SURE
I CAN CHOOSE YOU.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.792
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

33:18.834 --> 33:20.166
(knocks on door)

33:20.208 --> 33:22.417
HI.

33:22.458 --> 33:23.875
HEY.

33:25.542 --> 33:27.125
HOW ARE YOU?

33:27.166 --> 33:29.417
OKAY.

33:29.458 --> 33:33.166
I DIDN'T WANT TO HOLD HER,

33:33.208 --> 33:35.208
BUT THEN I DID, AND...

33:35.250 --> 33:37.583
(sighs)

33:37.625 --> 33:40.375
DO YOU WANT TO HOLD HER?

33:40.417 --> 33:42.166
(exhales deeply)

33:43.458 --> 33:44.875
YES.

33:47.083 --> 33:48.458
(snorts)

33:48.500 --> 33:50.000
OH.

33:50.041 --> 33:51.041
AHH.

33:51.083 --> 33:52.959
OH.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.041
OH, HI, LITTLE GIRL.

33:55.083 --> 33:59.041
(singsongy)
HELLO, BABY GIRL.

33:59.083 --> 34:01.041
ADDISON.

34:01.083 --> 34:03.417
(normal voice) YES.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.458
