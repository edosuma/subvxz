Now I have to figure out
what happened to Quinn.

00:11.409 --> 00:14.033
- What do you mean?
I thought he was with you. - He was.

00:14.137 --> 00:15.476
<i>And then he wasn't.</i>

00:15.564 --> 00:16.973
<i>He just disappeared.</i>

00:18.186 --> 00:20.287
- Am I under arrest?
- That's something of

00:20.355 --> 00:21.856
an open question
at the moment.

00:21.923 --> 00:23.624
I'm not asking you

from Plotzensee Prison.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.501

talk about jihad?

00:34.568 --> 00:36.436
Once I overheard
about an attack in Berlin.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.505
Mr. Berenson, we've come
across an individual

00:38.572 --> 00:40.673
who may have information
about the attack.

00:40.741 --> 00:41.808
Will you give me your word

that he'll be treated fairly?

00:43.744 --> 00:45.112
BND.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.479
No! No! No!

00:46.547 --> 00:47.814
I need to talk to Al-Amin,

00:47.882 --> 00:49.182

01:07.734 --> 01:09.701
He penetrated a terror

01:09.769 --> 01:13.172
What he reported was a group of
jihadis on their way to Syria.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.673

him to regain consciousness?

from happening.

03:52.159 --> 03:54.260

for waking him up?

04:00.467 --> 04:02.202
Not one I would recommend,

on the extent

And I would have to do an MRI
first to make that assessment.

what are the risks?

15:17.325 --> 15:18.592
80/60. He's decerebrating.

15:18.660 --> 15:20.261
Lower the oxygen.

15:20.328 --> 15:21.796
Ten liters and running.

15:21.864 --> 15:23.430
He's on HiFLO 2 right now.

15:23.498 --> 15:24.632
Pupils
fixed and dilated.

15:24.699 --> 15:27.301
Apneic. 90/70.

15:27.369 --> 15:29.237
Alkanize his urine, get
him ready for hemoperfusion.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.405
I need CBC, lytes.
Call neuro.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.141
Copy that. CBC,
lytes. Call neuro.

15:33.208 --> 15:35.809
I need the endotracheal
tube and the Ambu bag.

15:35.877 --> 15:38.579
- Got the Ambu bag.
- I'll start bagging.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.583
We're running his line
wide open.

15:51.463 --> 15:52.864
_

15:53.516 --> 15:55.803
_

15:55.923 --> 15:57.592
_

15:58.508 --> 16:00.151
_

16:00.220 --> 16:01.956
_

16:02.102 --> 16:05.642
_

16:05.772 --> 16:08.012
_

16:11.137 --> 16:12.560
_

16:12.647 --> 16:13.736
_

16:13.824 --> 16:15.304
_

16:16.078 --> 16:19.004
_

16:19.104 --> 16:20.129
_

16:20.212 --> 16:21.234
_

16:23.031 --> 16:24.404
_

16:24.501 --> 16:26.966
_

16:27.992 --> 16:29.718
_

16:30.098 --> 16:31.666
_

16:32.407 --> 16:35.568
_

16:41.126 --> 16:41.748
_

16:41.845 --> 16:43.078
_

16:44.778 --> 16:46.245
Qasim.

16:46.312 --> 16:48.014
Come with me.

16:53.285 --> 16:55.554
This is the trigger
for the canisters.

16:55.621 --> 16:56.855
It's not working

16:56.923 --> 16:58.523
You need to bring it
to Dr. Aziz.

16:58.591 --> 16:59.891
Me?

16:59.959 --> 17:03.361
You're the only one of us
who's not on the watch list,

17:03.429 --> 17:04.896
who won't be stopped
and searched.

17:04.964 --> 17:07.531
You need to wait
till he's done fixing that,

17:07.599 --> 17:09.367
then come right back here.

17:09.435 --> 17:11.869
You're trusting me.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.909
I trust that
you love your mother.

17:19.344 --> 17:21.613
Don't look away, Qasim.

17:21.681 --> 17:24.615
Look at me, so I can see
you understand what I'm saying.

17:29.288 --> 17:31.355
Dr. Aziz is in faculty housing

17:31.423 --> 17:32.423
on campus.

17:32.491 --> 17:33.524
Block A,

17:33.592 --> 17:35.526
room 15.

17:46.638 --> 17:49.407
Respiratory tech to Treatment Room 7.

17:49.475 --> 17:52.476
Respiratory tech to
Treatment Room 7.

17:55.346 --> 17:56.580
Well, he's stable.

17:58.048 --> 17:59.249
Thank God.

17:59.317 --> 18:00.817
We got lucky.

18:00.884 --> 18:02.919
Based on what
happened in there,

18:02.987 --> 18:04.621
has his prognosis
changed at all?

18:04.688 --> 18:06.590
Well, it's hard to say.

18:06.657 --> 18:08.425
It hasn't gotten any better,
I can tell you that.

18:08.493 --> 18:10.260
Thank you, Doctor.

18:18.568 --> 18:22.037
Well... I got to get back.

18:22.105 --> 18:23.172
Of course.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.706
You're staying here, I assume.

18:24.774 --> 18:26.175
No.

18:26.243 --> 18:27.476
No?

18:27.544 --> 18:29.011
We know the atropine
saved his life,

18:29.078 --> 18:31.046
but that's not
the only thing.

18:31.114 --> 18:33.149
What do you mean?

18:33.216 --> 18:34.316
His bullet wound.

18:34.384 --> 18:36.185
A surgical drain was inserted

18:36.253 --> 18:38.020
into his abdomen
to treat the sepsis.

18:38.087 --> 18:39.988
Whoever did that had
serious medical training.

18:40.056 --> 18:41.990
You're thinking
it's the same person?

18:42.058 --> 18:43.825
I'm thinking there's
a Good Samaritan out there,

18:43.893 --> 18:45.360
probably not too happy about

18:45.427 --> 18:46.995
what he's been seeing
on television lately.

18:47.063 --> 18:48.496
That's an interesting theory.
I'll pass it along.

18:48.564 --> 18:49.997
Why not let me run it down?

18:50.065 --> 18:51.666
I mean, it's not exactly
the tip of the spear,

18:51.733 --> 18:53.534
and I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

18:55.436 --> 18:57.772
- Okay, but check in every step of the way.
- I will.

18:57.839 --> 18:59.707
Hello.

18:59.775 --> 19:01.375
Mr. Berenson, you assured me

19:01.442 --> 19:04.045
Faisal Marwan would be
treated fairly and with respect.

19:04.112 --> 19:07.447
Instead, he was just arrested,
forced into a car

19:07.515 --> 19:09.550
like a common criminal.

19:09.617 --> 19:12.053
Now even his lawyer
can't get access to him.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.621
I don't have to tell you,
we're facing a major threat.

19:14.690 --> 19:16.723
I know what we are facing.

19:16.791 --> 19:20.294
I'm talking about you and me,
what your word is worth.

19:20.361 --> 19:22.396
I don't tell the BND what to do.

19:22.463 --> 19:24.130
I gave them a heads-up
Marwan was coming in,

19:24.199 --> 19:25.131
that's all.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.633
I thought I could trust you

19:26.701 --> 19:28.768
because...

19:28.836 --> 19:32.038
because Carrie Mathison
trusts you.

19:32.106 --> 19:33.039
Was I wrong?

19:33.107 --> 19:35.409
No.

19:35.476 --> 19:37.110
Well, then I expect you
to make this right.

19:37.178 --> 19:39.446
Okay.

19:39.514 --> 19:42.216
I'm on my way to the BND now.
I'll see what I can do.

19:42.283 --> 19:44.784
And you said his lawyer could be
present during all questioning.

19:44.852 --> 19:46.786
I said, I'll see what I can do.

19:53.994 --> 19:55.929
Oliver.

19:57.998 --> 20:00.433
I spoke to Berenson.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.668
He's going to check
on Marwan now.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.941
Will Jonas get access to him?

20:08.008 --> 20:09.474
I hope.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.944
Don't have an answer on that.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.950
Great.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.786
We've still got three
hours to the deadline.

20:20.854 --> 20:22.621
I pray it comes
to nothing,

20:22.688 --> 20:25.824
but until then, I must ask you
to keep a low profile.

20:28.862 --> 20:30.963
Your version of a gag order?

20:33.066 --> 20:35.267
Never thought
I'd see the day, Otto.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.602
Come on, Laura, I'm just asking
you to show some sensitivity

20:37.670 --> 20:39.103
in a difficult time.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.838
I am sensitive.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.441
It's just a hell of a lot
more difficult for Marwan,

20:43.509 --> 20:45.109
- is what I'm saying.
- I know,

20:45.177 --> 20:47.011
but we have
to be careful.

20:47.079 --> 20:51.449
Your reputation is on the line,
and so is the Foundation's.

20:51.517 --> 20:52.517
Is that clear?

20:55.554 --> 20:57.188
Yes.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.623
Good.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.085
Hello.

21:28.153 --> 21:29.620
Numan, it's me.

21:29.688 --> 21:31.289
Laura, hey.

21:31.356 --> 21:32.790
Were you able to get

21:32.858 --> 21:34.358
the documents back,

21:34.426 --> 21:36.627
download them off
Carrie's laptop like you said?

21:36.695 --> 21:39.196
Yeah. She never
suspected a thing.

21:39.263 --> 21:41.498
All 1,361 of them?

21:41.566 --> 21:43.066
Yep. Why?

21:43.134 --> 21:46.870
If anything happens to me...

21:46.938 --> 21:50.040
I want them to be released.

21:52.143 --> 21:54.845
What do you mean,
if anything happens to you?

21:54.912 --> 22:00.183
You know, if I'm arrested
or... whatever.

22:00.251 --> 22:04.186
Laura, what's going on?

22:04.254 --> 22:05.521
Nothing.

22:05.589 --> 22:06.689
Don't tell me "nothing."

22:06.757 --> 22:08.090
What are you planning?

22:08.158 --> 22:09.859
Look, it's better
if you don't know.

22:09.926 --> 22:11.427
Just release the documents,

22:11.495 --> 22:13.195
if it comes to that.

22:13.263 --> 22:15.130
Don't worry about vetting them
like the last time.

22:15.198 --> 22:17.299
The important thing is
just get them out there.

22:17.368 --> 22:18.634
Go big.

22:18.702 --> 22:20.737
Blow the damn lid off.

22:20.804 --> 22:23.939
Then wipe your shit clean,
leave no trace.

22:24.007 --> 22:24.940
You got it.

22:25.008 --> 22:28.577
Thank you, Numan.

22:28.644 --> 22:30.044
I mean that.

22:34.083 --> 22:36.184
Born in Dresden,
raised in Hamburg,

22:36.252 --> 22:39.521
presumably where
he met Bibi Hamed.

22:39.589 --> 22:41.523
Their fathers worked
together at the port there,

22:41.591 --> 22:43.057
unloading
container ships.

22:43.125 --> 22:45.861
Who are we talking about?

22:45.928 --> 22:47.896
The body we discovered
with Peter Quinn

22:47.963 --> 22:49.431
at the old Dorofeev barracks.

22:49.499 --> 22:51.732
Name's Zaheer al-Sherali.

22:51.800 --> 22:52.900
A student, huh?

22:52.967 --> 22:54.935
Enrolled at TU Berlin.

22:55.003 --> 22:57.571
The Universitat der Technik?

22:57.639 --> 22:59.774
Although he was behind
on his tuition payments,

22:59.841 --> 23:01.475
according to
the registrar,

23:01.543 --> 23:04.144
and hadn't been to classes
in over three months.

23:04.212 --> 23:06.146
Well, I know two women
on the faculty there.

23:06.214 --> 23:07.615
How's that?

23:07.682 --> 23:09.917
They consult with us
on EU economic issues.

23:09.984 --> 23:12.252
Happy to reach out to them
if you want.

23:15.891 --> 23:17.591
Your call.

23:17.659 --> 23:20.594
Just as happy to go back
to the station.

23:21.896 --> 23:23.963
Either way, I don't go

23:24.031 --> 23:26.332
anywhere these days
without my bodyguard.

23:58.265 --> 23:59.999
- Hello.
- Hello.

24:01.435 --> 24:03.369
Will you tell Al-Amin
I'm sorry to disturb him,

24:03.437 --> 24:05.337
but it's urgent
that I speak with him?

24:05.404 --> 24:06.804
Al-Amin?

24:06.872 --> 24:08.206
Yes.

24:08.274 --> 24:09.975
I don't know anybody
by that name.

24:10.042 --> 24:11.042
Please.

24:11.110 --> 24:13.178
I mean him no harm.
I'm not the police.

24:15.281 --> 24:17.215
Wait here.

24:29.128 --> 24:30.462
Quickly.

24:39.037 --> 24:40.972
This way. Follow me.

24:43.609 --> 24:45.342
How dare you
invade my home?

24:45.410 --> 24:46.811
- Commander...
- Who's coming here?

24:46.879 --> 24:48.980
Federal Police, the BND, Mossad?

24:49.047 --> 24:50.515
- No one.
- No one? If no one's coming,

24:50.582 --> 24:52.015
then I'll kill you
with my own hands.

24:52.082 --> 24:53.016
Well, go ahead.

24:53.083 --> 24:55.151
But I am here alone,

24:55.219 --> 24:56.653
and no one knows
that I'm here.

24:57.922 --> 24:59.155
What was that?

25:01.425 --> 25:05.061
My wife taking the children
to safety, as instructed.

25:05.129 --> 25:08.231
I'm sorry. There was no time
to warn you I was on my way.

25:08.298 --> 25:09.198
What do you want?

25:09.266 --> 25:11.367
Information.

25:11.435 --> 25:13.537
About this terror
cell making threats.

25:13.604 --> 25:14.938
So now I am part of a plot

25:15.006 --> 25:16.539
to gas people
in the capitals of Europe?

25:16.606 --> 25:18.273
Are you?

25:18.341 --> 25:19.441
No.

25:19.509 --> 25:21.544
- Do you know who is?
- No.

25:21.611 --> 25:24.046
But if I did know them, I would
tell them they were idiots.

25:24.113 --> 25:25.581
Why's that?

25:25.649 --> 25:27.583
America's on the run,
Israel isolated;

25:27.651 --> 25:28.951
now's not the time to be

25:29.019 --> 25:30.152
rallying the world
against Muslims.

25:30.219 --> 25:31.654
So you'll help me.

25:31.721 --> 25:33.488
I didn't say that.

25:33.557 --> 25:36.224
You're fighting the Islamic
State in Syria; why not here?

25:36.292 --> 25:38.861
Strange times
for Hezbollah, I admit.

25:40.931 --> 25:43.898
You are soldiers involved
in a political struggle.

25:43.966 --> 25:46.868
These are zealots prophesizing
the arrival of the Mahdi

25:46.936 --> 25:48.436
and a countdown
to the Apocalypse.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.104
Like I said, idiots.

25:50.172 --> 25:52.273
Scum.

25:53.809 --> 25:56.377
I'm looking for a man.

25:56.445 --> 25:58.212
Somebody with-with
medical training--

25:58.280 --> 26:00.048
possibly a doctor,
possibly operating

26:00.115 --> 26:02.283
an unlicensed clinic somewhere
in or around Kreuzberg.

26:02.350 --> 26:04.552
Why?

26:04.620 --> 26:06.888
He saved my friend.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.422
He-he might
know something.

26:08.490 --> 26:10.991
I mean, why should I help you?

26:15.163 --> 26:17.098
Honestly, I don't know.

26:19.767 --> 26:23.170
Maybe because you did the
right thing once before.

26:24.506 --> 26:26.140
Maybe because
you lost a son.

26:26.208 --> 26:29.543
Maybe because more fathers
will lose their sons

26:29.611 --> 26:31.545
if we don't stop this thing.

26:40.621 --> 26:42.555
There is such a man.

26:47.528 --> 26:49.429
Sees patients
in his apartment.

26:50.664 --> 26:53.266
The poor,
mostly refugees.

26:54.335 --> 26:56.102
Pay what you can.

26:57.338 --> 26:59.105
What's his name?

26:59.173 --> 27:00.340
He's no jihadi, though.

27:00.407 --> 27:02.775
What is his name?

27:04.344 --> 27:06.311
Hussein.

27:11.017 --> 27:12.784
Saul.

27:12.852 --> 27:14.786
You've come from
seeing Peter Quinn?

27:14.854 --> 27:15.887
Yes.

27:15.955 --> 27:17.322
How's he doing?

27:18.558 --> 27:20.992
He regained consciousness,
briefly.

27:23.062 --> 27:24.530
Did he say anything?

27:24.597 --> 27:26.165
He tried to.

27:28.268 --> 27:31.436
It's not looking good.

27:31.504 --> 27:34.939
Damage is, uh... extensive.

27:39.011 --> 27:40.611
Anyway.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.113
You want to see Marwan?

27:42.181 --> 27:43.481
Yes.

27:46.518 --> 27:48.653
Why pull him
off the street?

27:48.721 --> 27:50.488
He was about
to give himself up.

27:50.556 --> 27:54.492
We were worried During might try
something at the last minute.

27:54.560 --> 27:57.195
He hasn't exactly been
cooperative in the past.

28:12.243 --> 28:14.845
Biometrics?

28:14.913 --> 28:16.847
Is that really necessary?

28:19.483 --> 28:21.351
Looks scared
out of his mind.

28:22.853 --> 28:24.787
We were getting
nowhere,

28:24.855 --> 28:27.423
so the interrogator
decided to change it up.

28:28.525 --> 28:30.459
I want to talk to him.

28:32.629 --> 28:34.463
Adler will not agree.

28:34.531 --> 28:36.132
Does Adler have to know?

28:38.836 --> 28:40.803
Let's try it my way, then.

28:40.871 --> 28:42.138
Give him his
clothes back,

28:42.206 --> 28:44.073
put him in a nice
office, nice cup of tea.

28:44.141 --> 28:45.307
Tea?

28:45.375 --> 28:47.910
Make it spearmint--
he's Moroccan.

28:47.978 --> 28:49.746
Plenty of sugar.

29:02.692 --> 29:04.627
♪

29:15.604 --> 29:17.037
Professor Aziz.

29:17.105 --> 29:19.039
Not here.

29:30.051 --> 29:32.186
You shouldn't be here.
I made it perfectly clear.

29:32.254 --> 29:33.954
I couldn't have been
clearer with Bibi.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.291
Bibi is the one
who sent me.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.493
What is it?

29:38.560 --> 29:40.327
The signal is
not transmitting.

29:40.395 --> 29:42.329
I gave Utku
instructions.

29:42.397 --> 29:45.632
I'm not a technical person,
so I can't say what's wrong.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.634
Utku wrote it down.

30:01.249 --> 30:04.418
Bibi wants me to tell him
how long this will take.

30:04.485 --> 30:07.421
I'll know more
after I run a diagnostic.

30:14.929 --> 30:17.731
You haven't
touched your tea.

30:17.799 --> 30:19.366
I don't want tea.

30:19.434 --> 30:22.035
I want to go back
to my sister's.

30:22.102 --> 30:23.903
That's not gonna happen
unless you start cooperating.

30:23.971 --> 30:25.772
What more can I do?

30:25.840 --> 30:29.376
I've answered the same questions
over and over again.

30:29.444 --> 30:30.677
Well, even I'm
starting to believe

30:30.745 --> 30:32.512
you know something
you're not saying.

30:32.580 --> 30:35.148
You were in prison with these
guys for over a year and a half.

30:35.216 --> 30:38.183
I was in prison
with one of them.

30:38.251 --> 30:40.185
One man, Hajik Zayd.

30:42.121 --> 30:43.889
All right.

30:43.957 --> 30:46.892
Before that...

30:46.960 --> 30:48.728
you sold cell phones
to the others.

30:48.795 --> 30:51.063
To some of the others, yes.

30:51.130 --> 30:52.531
Well, nobody spends
all that time

30:52.599 --> 30:54.367
with their eyes closed,
hands over their ears.

30:54.434 --> 30:56.034
Come on, think I'm an idiot?

30:56.102 --> 30:59.037
I told you, I heard four words.

30:59.105 --> 31:01.407
<i>Das Ziel ist Berlin--
Berlin is the target.</i>

31:01.475 --> 31:03.876
That's all.

31:03.943 --> 31:07.546
Do you want me to make
something else up?

31:07.614 --> 31:09.615
Because I will.

31:11.650 --> 31:12.951
No?

31:13.019 --> 31:14.920
Then tell me what to do. Please.

31:14.988 --> 31:17.923
You know what to do.

31:17.991 --> 31:18.991
Think.

31:19.058 --> 31:21.326
Remember.

31:21.394 --> 31:23.328
I am trying.

31:23.396 --> 31:25.463
Try harder.

31:25.531 --> 31:27.465
I don't know.

31:29.835 --> 31:32.771
'Cause if this attack
goes down...

31:32.838 --> 31:35.407
I can't protect you
from what comes next.

31:37.110 --> 31:38.210
Nobody can.

31:40.113 --> 31:42.381
Something you need to see.

31:53.058 --> 31:56.428
It will become
a strictly German matter.

31:56.495 --> 31:59.263
You know better than anybody
what that means.

32:10.042 --> 32:12.977
...and is
at this moment being denied

32:13.045 --> 32:15.612
his constitutional
right to counsel.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.049
But why was he arrested
in the first place?

32:18.116 --> 32:19.483
He wasn't arrested.

32:19.551 --> 32:20.884
Not in the normal sense.

32:20.953 --> 32:22.320
He was rounded up.

32:22.387 --> 32:23.988
And this is the best part.

32:24.056 --> 32:27.191
He'd already volunteered
to help the investigation.

32:27.259 --> 32:28.725
Perhaps that's what

32:28.793 --> 32:31.462
he's doing, then,
helping the BND.

32:31.529 --> 32:33.464
Then why the silence?

32:33.531 --> 32:35.466
Why can't he be reached?

32:35.533 --> 32:37.301
Remember, this man
had already been

32:37.369 --> 32:39.303
illegally imprisoned
once before.

32:39.371 --> 32:42.138
One could argue that
in extraordinary times

32:42.206 --> 32:45.509
the state is justified in
taking extraordinary measures.

32:46.711 --> 32:48.178
I used to believe that.

32:48.245 --> 32:51.147
I really did.

32:51.215 --> 32:52.983
But now,

32:53.050 --> 32:57.488
a decade and a half
into the War on Terror,

32:57.555 --> 32:59.189
it's not so simple.

32:59.256 --> 33:02.993
I've seen my country, and yours,

33:03.060 --> 33:07.497
tear up hard-won civil rights,
suspend habeas corpus,

33:07.564 --> 33:09.399
resort to torture,

33:09.467 --> 33:12.235
extrajudicial killings,

33:12.303 --> 33:15.005
and the wholesale surveillance
of its own citizens.

33:15.072 --> 33:16.839
Has any of it worked?

33:16.907 --> 33:18.341
I don't think so.

33:18.409 --> 33:21.344
In fact, you could argue
it's made things worse.

33:21.412 --> 33:23.913
What would work, in your view?

33:25.983 --> 33:27.750
Yeah, I wish I knew.

33:27.818 --> 33:30.686
How about starting with respect
for the rule of law?

33:30.754 --> 33:34.689
But you must agree it's a tough
time for making that point,

33:34.757 --> 33:37.526
when all of Europe is
in a state of emergency.

33:37.593 --> 33:38.693
Of course it's tough.

33:38.761 --> 33:40.729
Everyone's scared.

33:40.796 --> 33:42.731
I'm scared.

33:42.798 --> 33:45.734
But that can't make us
forget who we are.

33:47.404 --> 33:49.905
Do you honestly think
you can win the argument?

33:51.307 --> 33:54.676
Honestly... no.

33:56.246 --> 33:59.948
So I'm not just making
an argument.

34:00.016 --> 34:02.217
What do you mean?

34:04.286 --> 34:07.221
If I'm not allowed to speak
to Faisal Marwan immediately,

34:07.289 --> 34:12.060
I will release the remaining
1,360 classified documents

34:12.127 --> 34:14.228
in my possession.

34:14.295 --> 34:17.065
The documents
that were hacked from the CIA?

34:17.132 --> 34:19.434
Yes.

34:19.501 --> 34:21.135
One can only imagine what other

34:21.203 --> 34:23.638
embarrassing revelations
they contain.

34:23.706 --> 34:26.306
Fuck you.

34:26.375 --> 34:28.743
Tell me, are you
acting on your own

34:28.811 --> 34:30.879
or is this with the blessing
of the During Foundation?

34:30.947 --> 34:35.248
No, the Foundation is not
involved in any way.

34:35.317 --> 34:37.751
It's... just me.

34:39.154 --> 34:40.721
You're not worried about...

34:40.789 --> 34:41.789
retaliation?

34:41.856 --> 34:45.226
Of course I am.

34:45.293 --> 34:47.594
The documents will
be released regardless.

34:47.661 --> 34:51.431
We'll take
a short break, then come back

34:51.500 --> 34:54.768
to my unexpected guest,
the American journalist

34:54.835 --> 34:57.572
Laura Sutton.

34:57.639 --> 35:00.074
See what Adler wants
us to do about this.

35:02.978 --> 35:04.912
So, back to Marwan?

35:39.879 --> 35:41.947
<i>Scheisse.</i>

35:58.230 --> 36:00.632
Well, our Laura Sutton problem
just got worse.

36:03.369 --> 36:06.138
Can we take
a minute here, please?

36:33.232 --> 36:36.801
You deal with Laura Sutton.

36:36.868 --> 36:39.870
I think I've had enough
for one day.

36:44.410 --> 36:46.844
You have kids?

36:46.912 --> 36:48.846
Hmm.

36:48.914 --> 36:50.381
How many?

36:50.449 --> 36:53.217
One son, Ashraf.

36:53.284 --> 36:55.252
Lives in Sidon
with his mother.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.387
Sidon?

36:57.455 --> 37:00.524
It's in Lebanon,
in the south.

37:07.766 --> 37:09.533
How long have
you lived here?

37:09.601 --> 37:11.535
This flat?

37:11.603 --> 37:13.370
In Berlin.

37:13.438 --> 37:15.206
Three years,
ever since I was offered

37:15.273 --> 37:17.574
the teaching position
at the university.

37:17.642 --> 37:19.909
And you're not
at all conflicted?

37:19.977 --> 37:21.644
About what?

37:21.712 --> 37:23.646
Doing what we are doing.

37:28.152 --> 37:30.419
It's just...

37:30.487 --> 37:33.723
this country seems
to have taken you in,

37:33.791 --> 37:35.725
treated you well.

37:38.662 --> 37:42.598
This benevolent country
you talk about, Germany,

37:42.666 --> 37:45.568
it supports the State of Israel
unequivocally.

37:45.636 --> 37:49.571
So when Israel bombed the living
shit out of Lebanon in 2006,

37:49.639 --> 37:51.206
what did the good
Germans do, huh?

37:51.274 --> 37:54.243
They sent troops,
not to help my people

37:54.310 --> 37:57.246
who had been cut to ribbons
by the cluster bombs,

37:57.313 --> 37:59.248
but to defend gallant
little Israel

37:59.315 --> 38:01.250
against a possible
counterattack.

38:01.317 --> 38:03.618
That is why I do what I do.

38:05.321 --> 38:07.089
And the caliphate?

38:07.157 --> 38:08.924
What about it?

38:08.992 --> 38:12.294
Every Muslim must rush
to make his religion victorious.

38:12.361 --> 38:14.429
The winds of faith
have come.

38:16.499 --> 38:18.966
I'm an atheist.

38:25.274 --> 38:26.841
You must go.

38:26.909 --> 38:28.643
- You cannot be seen here.
- Is it working now?

38:28.711 --> 38:29.711
No. No.

38:29.779 --> 38:31.813
What should
I tell Bibi?

38:31.880 --> 38:34.649
Tell him.... tell him he has to
activate the machine manually.

38:34.717 --> 38:36.050
Here, this way.

38:55.769 --> 38:58.038
- Can I help you?
- Professor Aziz?

38:58.105 --> 38:59.873
- Aman Aziz?
- Yes.

38:59.941 --> 39:01.708
I'm Allison Carr.
This is Conrad Fuller.

39:01.775 --> 39:03.409
We're working with
the German Federal Police.

39:03.477 --> 39:04.878
I wonder if we could
talk to you.

39:04.946 --> 39:06.913
About what?

39:06.981 --> 39:09.082
A graduate student of yours,
Zaheer al-Sherali.

39:09.150 --> 39:10.917
Well, I'm his thesis advisor.

39:10.985 --> 39:12.719
Yes, I know.

39:12.786 --> 39:14.554
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this,

39:14.621 --> 39:16.389
but his body was found
earlier this morning.

39:16.457 --> 39:17.423
He's dead.

39:17.491 --> 39:20.227
What?

39:20.294 --> 39:22.228
Do you mind if we come in?

39:49.522 --> 39:51.623
<i>Ja?</i>

39:51.691 --> 39:53.592
I need to speak to Dr. Hussein.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.427
What is this about?

39:55.495 --> 39:57.429
I'm from the During Foundation;
maybe you're familiar

39:57.497 --> 39:59.431
with our work in
the neighborhood.

39:59.499 --> 40:01.767
You'll have to wait.

40:01.834 --> 40:04.235
Tell him it's urgent.

40:04.303 --> 40:05.570
There are sick people here.

40:05.638 --> 40:06.905
You'll have to wait your turn.

40:13.546 --> 40:16.314
We understand he'd more or less
dropped out of school.

40:16.382 --> 40:18.116
He was having
difficulties, yes.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.951
What kind of difficulties?

40:20.019 --> 40:21.119
Financial.

40:21.186 --> 40:22.620
Just financial?

40:22.687 --> 40:24.289
What do you mean?

40:24.356 --> 40:26.291
I don't know.

40:26.358 --> 40:29.527
Trouble with a girlfriend, in a
feud with one of his roommates?

40:29.594 --> 40:31.429
Yeah, I wouldn't know
anything about that.

40:31.496 --> 40:33.464
Ours was, uh, an
academic relationship.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.900
I saw him in school
during office hours,

40:35.968 --> 40:37.735
that's it.

40:37.803 --> 40:40.104
Excuse me, what are you
looking for, please?

40:40.172 --> 40:41.605
What are these?

40:41.673 --> 40:45.175
Term projects for
my coding seminar.

40:47.011 --> 40:49.647
You said Zaheer
was found dead.

40:49.714 --> 40:50.981
Is that was this is about?

40:51.049 --> 40:52.316
You suspect foul play?

40:52.383 --> 40:54.184
He was shot in the face.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.519
My God.

40:55.587 --> 40:56.787
Any idea who might
have killed him?

40:56.855 --> 40:58.288
None.

40:59.357 --> 41:01.024
What would you say if I told you

41:01.092 --> 41:02.993
we discovered his body
in the same place

41:03.061 --> 41:04.328
that video was filmed,

41:04.395 --> 41:07.331
the one that's
all over the news?

41:07.398 --> 41:09.800
Were you aware of his
extremist views, Professor?

41:09.868 --> 41:11.300
No, I was not.

41:11.368 --> 41:13.169
Let's talk about your
extremist views.

41:13.236 --> 41:15.538
Last year you gave a sizable
contribution to Al Haq.

41:15.606 --> 41:18.508
Al Haq is an NGO,
anti-Zionist, yes...

41:18.576 --> 41:20.677
Your degree's in applied
mathematics, is it not?

41:20.744 --> 41:22.178
I have a PhD.

41:22.245 --> 41:23.680
But you taught a course
in biochemical engineering

41:23.747 --> 41:26.516
at the American
University in Beirut.

41:26.584 --> 41:29.352
- Who did you say you are again?
- Sit down.

41:32.723 --> 41:34.290
You're jumping to conclusions.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.325
Your thesis advisee
is found at the staging area

41:36.393 --> 41:38.361
for an imminent
WMD attack,

41:38.428 --> 41:40.496
you have expertise
in the very technology

41:40.563 --> 41:42.131
the terrorists are
threatening to use.

41:43.867 --> 41:45.834
I'm a tenured professor,
a German citizen.

Be a good one, then,
and tell me what the target is.

41:48.438 --> 41:49.671
Target? I don't even know
what you're talking about.

41:49.739 --> 41:50.839
Bullshit.

asshole lying through his teeth.

Give me your gun
and call for an arrest team.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.220
What's the target?

42:05.287 --> 42:06.889

I don't know.

42:06.956 --> 42:09.257
No, you said before you had no

going to shoot me.

You should get a forensics team

49:07.030 --> 49:08.297
Yeah, specifically

49:08.364 --> 49:09.532
the U-Bahn network.

49:09.599 --> 49:11.033
5:00 is rush hour.
