14:02.842 --> 14:05.627
I USED TO DO BIKINI CONTESTS,

14:05.757 --> 14:07.498
IT COULD HURT MY
CREDIBILITY AS A LIFEGUARD.

14:07.629 --> 14:10.197
-YOU WON $2,000
IN PALM SPRINGS.

14:11.198 --> 14:14.114
LOOK, I'VE WON $23,000
CIRCUIT SO FAR THIS YEAR.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.422
IT'S NOT A BAD SUPPLEMENT FOR
A FIFTH GRADE TEACHER SALARY.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.077
WHAT'S EMBARRASSING ABOUT THAT?

14:21.208 --> 14:22.731
-NOTHING. OH, NOTHING.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.516
IT'S JUST--IT'S
PERCEPTION, YOU KNOW.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.083
PERCEPTION'S EVERYTHING.

14:28.302 --> 14:31.087
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF YOU
COULD KEEP THIS TO YOURSELF,

14:31.218 --> 14:32.262
OKAY?

14:34.569 --> 14:38.268
-WELL I'LL TRY, BUT I
CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.228
SOMETIMES, SECRETS HAVE
A WAY OF GETTING OUT.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.192
-CAN I TALK TO
YOU FOR A SECOND?

14:49.323 --> 14:51.020
-ACTUALLY, I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO BE LATE FOR CLASS.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.630
-WELL ACTUALLY, THAT'S WHAT
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.937
YOU KNOW, I'M WRITING A
SCRIPT IS KIND OF A CROSS

14:55.068 --> 14:56.896
BETWEEN POINT BREAK
AND FATAL ATTRACTION.

14:57.026 --> 14:57.984
-RIGHT, I KNOW THIS.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.507
YOU TOLD ME ALL OF THIS ALREADY.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.117
-RIGHT, WELL THE THING
IS, I'VE HIT A BIT

15:01.248 --> 15:03.032
OF A SNAG WITH THE DIALOGUE.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.338
AND I FIGURED MAYBE YOU COULD
DO SOME OF THE SCENES IN CLASS,

15:04.468 --> 15:05.513
SO I COULD HEAR WHAT
THEY SOUND LIKE.

15:06.253 --> 15:07.602
-ARE YOU SERIOUS?

15:07.732 --> 15:08.864
-I'M VERY SERIOUS.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.126
I'M GONNA SELL THE SCRIPT, CAROLINE.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.649
IF YOU HELP ME, I'LL HELP YOU.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.129
-REALLY?

15:13.260 --> 15:15.044
AND HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO THAT?

15:15.175 --> 15:17.133
-WELL THERE'S A PARTY COMING
UP AT THE MAIN STREET GALLERY,

15:17.264 --> 15:18.787
ALL THE TOP HOLLYWOOD
AGENTS AND PRODUCERS

15:18.918 --> 15:19.962
WILL BE THERE.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.878
I CAN GET YOU IN, AND WHO KNOWS.

15:23.531 --> 15:24.924
MAYBE YOU'LL BE DISCOVERED.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.280
HELP ME.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.586
HELP YOURSELF.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.112
-HELP ME.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.071
-HELP YOURSELF.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.117
-HELP ME.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.033
-HELP YOURSELF.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.599
-CAROLINE.

15:48.730 --> 15:49.687
CAROLINE, WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING FROM TAMMY?

15:51.472 --> 15:54.866
-ANGER. SCORN.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.390
-HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

15:58.435 --> 16:02.178
-I DON'T KNOW, IT MAKES ME
RESENTFUL AND FRUSTRATED.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.180
-THOSE ARE CONCEPTS.

16:04.311 --> 16:05.355
WHAT DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL?

16:07.053 --> 16:08.532
THERE!

16:08.663 --> 16:10.447
THERE, WHAT'S CHURNING
INSIDE YOU RIGHT NOW?

16:11.666 --> 16:12.754
-FEAR.
-WHAT!

16:14.495 --> 16:15.539
-FEAR, I FEEL FEAR.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.280
-YES, SO EXPRESS IT.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.891
GO WITH IT. LET IT OUT.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.895
SWITCH. TAMMY, YOU START.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.205
-HELP ME.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.424
-HELP YOURSELF.

16:30.554 --> 16:31.860
-MORE.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.427
-HELP ME.

16:33.557 --> 16:34.384
-HELP YOURSELF.

16:34.515 --> 16:35.385
-DIG DEEPER, CAROLINE.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.387
-HELP YOURSELF.

16:37.518 --> 16:38.432
-COME ON, MORE.

16:38.562 --> 16:39.563
-HELP ME!

16:40.521 --> 16:41.478
-HELP YOURSELF.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.437
-THERE. SEE HOW IT CHANGED?

16:44.525 --> 16:47.310
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE WORDS SHE'S SAYING.

16:48.355 --> 16:49.660
OR THE WORDS YOU'RE SAYING.

16:50.531 --> 16:53.012
IT'S ABOUT HOW SHE
MAKES YOU FEEL.

16:54.274 --> 16:58.582
-WHAT IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE
ACTOR YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH,

16:58.713 --> 17:00.410
BUT IN THE SCENE YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO LIKE THEM?

17:02.238 --> 17:05.849
-USE IT AS A COLOR.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.988
THAT'S ALL FOR TONIGHT.

17:16.252 --> 17:18.863
-KEEP TRYING, YOU'LL
GET IT EVENTUALLY.

17:25.869 --> 17:27.262
YOU'RE NEW IN CLASS?

17:27.394 --> 17:28.656
-I'M JUST HERE WITH A FRIEND.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.136
ACTUALLY, I'M A WRITER.

17:30.266 --> 17:31.789
-REALLY? WHAT HAVE YOU WRITTEN?

17:31.920 --> 17:33.617
-I JUST WROTE A NEW SCREENPLAY.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.184
IT'S KIND OF A CROSS BETWEEN--

17:35.315 --> 17:36.577
-IS THERE ANYTHING IN
IT I MIGHT BE RIGHT FOR?

17:37.447 --> 17:38.927
-WELL ACTUALLY, YOU
COULD PLAY REGINA.

17:40.015 --> 17:42.800
SHE'S A BAD GIRL THOUGH,
BUT IT'S THE LEAD.

17:43.453 --> 17:44.933
-I LOVE BEING BAD.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.632
-ANYWAY, IT'S AN
ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY

17:48.763 --> 17:50.504
THAT A FRIEND OF MINE WROTE.
IT'S REALLY VERY GOOD,

17:50.634 --> 17:52.027
AND HE WANTS TO HEAR
IT UP ON ITS FEET,

17:52.158 --> 17:53.637
SO I SAID THAT WE'D DO A
SCENE FROM IT IN CLASS.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.161
I MEAN, IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,

17:55.291 --> 17:56.988
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY GOOD

17:57.119 --> 17:59.295
CONSIDERING THAT IT'S THE FIRST
TIME HE EVER WROTE ANYTHING.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.775
AND I'M BABBLING, SORRY.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.734
-YOU CAN DO THE PHONE
BOOK, IF YOU WANT.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.519
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME

18:06.172 --> 18:09.000
JUST AS LONG AS YOU GIVE ME
WHAT'S REALLY INSIDE YOU.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.830
EVERYTHING YOU NEED
IS RIGHT IN THERE.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.616
YOU JUST GOTTA LET IT OUT.

18:26.409 --> 18:27.671
-SO, WHAT DID HE SAY?

18:28.846 --> 18:32.415
-HE SAID, FINE. WE'LL
DO IT IN OUR NEXT CLASS.

18:32.546 --> 18:33.373
-GREAT.

18:33.503 --> 18:34.678
-GREAT.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.294
-WHY ARE YOU
TORTURING YOURSELF,

18:41.424 --> 18:43.122
GO HOME AND BED
YOUR QUESTIONNAIRES.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.211
-STILL TRYING TO PROTECT ME?

18:45.341 --> 18:46.777
-SOMEONE HAS TO.

18:47.604 --> 18:50.085
SPEAKING OF PROTECTION,
WHY DO YOU INSIST

18:50.216 --> 18:51.913
ON BEING A PRIVATE DETECTIVE?

18:52.043 --> 18:53.349
IT'S DANGEROUS.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.221
-AT LEAST THERE,
I'M MY OWN BOSS.

18:55.351 --> 18:58.659
I DON'T HAVE SOMEONE TELLING
ME WHAT I CAN OR CANNOT DO.

18:58.789 --> 19:01.270
-ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU'D
RATHER I WASN'T YOUR CAPTAIN?

19:01.401 --> 19:04.230
-NO, I'M JUST SAYING I'M NOT
THRILLED ABOUT BEING UP HERE

19:04.360 --> 19:06.362
WHILE THE PARTY'S
GOING ON DOWN THERE.

19:06.493 --> 19:09.104
-WELL, THAT'S THE
PRICE OF INTEGRITY.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.542
DON'T WORRY, I'LL BRING
YOU A PIECE OF CAKE.

19:13.848 --> 19:16.198
-YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A SADIST,
YOU'RE A TRUE SADIST.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.244
TELL YOU WHAT, I'M NOT
GONNA HANG AROUND HERE

19:18.374 --> 19:20.246
AND WATCH YOU WATCH ME SUFFER.

19:21.072 --> 19:26.121
I'M GONNA GO HOME
AND SUFFER PRIVATELY.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.438
-MITCH. OVER HERE.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.527
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.411
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A
WEAKNESS FOR LIFEGUARDS.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.240
ONE SAVED MY LIFE WHEN
I WAS NINE YEARS OLD.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.634
I WAS TOO WEAK TO SWIM.

20:01.504 --> 20:05.552
THAT'S WHEN I COMMITTED MYSELF
TO GETTING MY BODY IN SHAPE.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.904
-WELL, YOU CERTAINLY HAVE
HONORED THAT COMMITMENT.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.254
-SPEAKING OF COMMITMENTS,

20:12.385 --> 20:14.561
ARE YOU INVOLVED WITH
ANYONE AT THE MOMENT?

20:15.431 --> 20:18.826
-AT THE MOMENT, NO.

20:20.131 --> 20:22.133
-GREAT. NEITHER AM I.

20:26.921 --> 20:28.966
-DONOVAN WILL BE AT THE
LIGHTHOUSE TOMORROW NIGHT.

20:29.097 --> 20:30.098
YOU'LL GET THERE BEFORE HIM--

20:30.229 --> 20:31.404
-CAROLINE: I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

20:31.534 --> 20:32.709
-YOU'LL DO WHAT
I TELL YOU TO DO.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.407
-CAROLINE: I'LL
DO WHAT I DO BEST.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.104
YOU DID HIRE ME,
BECAUSE I CAN GET A MAN

20:36.235 --> 20:37.801
TO REVEAL HIS DEEPEST SECRETS.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.586
-LOGAN: NO, CAROLINE,
YOU'VE GOTTA BE SEDUCTIVE

20:39.716 --> 20:41.457
WHEN YOU SAY THAT LINE.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.285
-WELL WHAT IF I'M NOT FEELING
SEDUCTIVE AT THAT MOMENT?

20:43.416 --> 20:44.852
-IT DOESN'T MATTER,
JUST FEEL IT.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.942
OKAY, TAKE IT FROM,
"YOU'LL DO WHAT I TELL YOU."

20:51.467 --> 20:53.034
AND, ACTION.

20:53.861 --> 20:55.471
-YOU'LL DO WHAT
I TELL YOU TO DO.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.734
-I WILL DO--THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.301
HOW CAN YOU SIT
THERE AND TELL ME

20:59.432 --> 21:00.737
THAT WHAT I'M FEELING
DOESN'T MATTER.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.609
-IT DOES MATTER,
AS LONG AS YOU FEEL

21:02.739 --> 21:04.263
WHAT I TELL YOU TO FEEL.

21:04.393 --> 21:06.003
LOOK, I AM THE WRITER
AND THE DIRECTOR.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.309
THIS IS MY VISION.

21:07.962 --> 21:10.007
AND IT'S YOUR JOB AS
THE ACTOR TO EXECUTE IT.

21:10.138 --> 21:12.619
-I COMPLETELY DISAGREE,
IT IS MY JOB AS THE ACTOR

21:12.749 --> 21:14.447
TO ENHANCE YOUR SCRIPT.

21:14.577 --> 21:17.406
-YOU KNOW, THERE IS A
SIMPLE SOLUTION TO ALL THIS.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.192
IF CAROLINE CAN'T
FEEL SEDUCTIVE,

21:21.323 --> 21:22.542
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST SWITCH ROLES.

21:23.238 --> 21:24.108
-GOOD IDEA.

21:24.761 --> 21:25.849
CAROLINE, WHY DON'T YOU BE BETH.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.199
TAMMY, WHY DON'T YOU BE NIKKI?

21:28.330 --> 21:31.290
-WAIT A SECOND, I AM PERFECTLY
CAPABLE OF BEING SEDUCTIVE

21:31.420 --> 21:32.508
IF THE SCENE CALLS FOR IT.

21:32.639 --> 21:33.553
THAT IS NOT THE POINT.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.294
-YES IT IS.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.298
HI, I'M DARREN HIGHLAND.

21:39.428 --> 21:40.516
-LOGAN FOWLER.

21:40.647 --> 21:41.430
-NICE TO MEET YOU.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.127
-LOGAN: YOU TOO.

21:43.258 --> 21:45.173
-IF YOUR DIRECTOR WANTS
SEDUCTION AS AN UNDERCURRENT

21:45.304 --> 21:46.566
IN THE SCENE,

21:46.696 --> 21:49.046
THEN YOU NEED TO
EXPLORE IT COMPLETELY.

21:49.177 --> 21:51.701
TRY TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE
IT REAL FOR YOURSELF.

21:51.832 --> 21:53.007
-THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HER.

21:54.182 --> 21:55.444
IT IS. ISN'T THAT WHAT I SAID?

21:59.056 --> 22:01.407
-WHAT ABOUT FEELING WHAT THE
OTHER PERSON MAKES YOU FEEL?

22:01.537 --> 22:02.799
-WELL IT'S POSSIBLE
TO FEEL A LOT

22:02.930 --> 22:04.148
OF DIFFERENT THINGS AT ONCE.

22:05.541 --> 22:08.631
THE AUDIENCE JUST HAS TO BE
ABLE TO SEE THEM IN YOUR EYES.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.374
I WANT YOU TO TRY
THE SCENE AGAIN.

22:12.505 --> 22:14.855
-LOGAN: OKAY, FROM THE TOP.

22:14.985 --> 22:17.510
CAROLINE, WHY DON'T
YOU BE NIKKI AGAIN.

22:18.249 --> 22:19.555
TAMMY, WHY DON'T YOU BE BETH?

22:19.686 --> 22:21.688
-YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.434
-AND ACTION.

22:28.564 --> 22:31.045
-DONOVAN WILL BE AT THE
LIGHTHOUSE TOMORROW NIGHT.

22:31.175 --> 22:32.612
YOU HAVE TO GET
THERE BEFORE HIM.

22:32.742 --> 22:33.917
-I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.050
-YOU'LL DO WHAT
I TELL YOU TO DO.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.487
-I'LL DO WHAT I DO BEST.

22:38.618 --> 22:41.142
AFTER ALL, YOU DID HIRE ME
BECAUSE I CAN GET ANY MAN

22:41.272 --> 22:43.013
TO REVEAL HIS DEEPEST SECRET.

22:43.144 --> 22:44.537
-HOLD IT.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.974
CAROLINE, IS THAT YOUR
IDEA OF SEDUCTIVE?

22:47.714 --> 22:48.889
-YES.

22:49.019 --> 22:50.107
I MEAN, THAT'S
WHAT I WAS FEELING.

22:50.238 --> 22:51.761
-WELL, IT'S NOT SEDUCTIVE.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.154
-YES IT WAS.

22:53.894 --> 22:56.070
I WASN'T EVEN LOOKING
AND I FELT IT.

22:57.506 --> 22:58.899
YOU WROTE THIS
MATERIAL, DIDN'T YOU?

22:59.029 --> 23:00.814
-LOGAN: YES.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.598
-AND SO YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN
IT PLAYED OUT IN YOUR HEAD.

23:02.729 --> 23:05.732
ALL YOUR IMAGINARY PEOPLE
DOING YOUR IMAGINARY THINGS.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.037
-EXACTLY.

23:07.168 --> 23:08.822
-WELL CLEAR YOUR HEAD.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.086
UNTIL YOU CAN FORGET EVERYTHING
YOU'VE EVER IMAGINED,

23:12.216 --> 23:14.784
SO THAT YOU CAN EXPERIENCE
IT FOR THE FIRST TIME,

23:14.915 --> 23:16.177
HERE AND NOW.

23:16.786 --> 23:19.223
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL
EVER BECOME A DECENT DIRECTOR.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.407
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW?

23:29.930 --> 23:31.018
-DESIRE.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.063
-USE IT.

23:41.463 --> 23:44.771
-WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST
START THE SCENE FROM THE TOP.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.121
-SOME OF THE GIRLS TRY
TO INFLUENCE THE JUDGES.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.731
SEDUCE THEM, WHATEVER.

23:49.297 --> 23:50.472
BUT THEY'RE USUALLY THE
ONES THAT DON'T HAVE MUCH

23:50.603 --> 23:52.213
OF A CHANCE OF WINNING ANYWAY.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.563
-WELL, I'M SURE THERE'S
A LOT OF JUDGES WHO TRY

23:54.694 --> 23:56.652
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THOSE POSITIONS TOO.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.219
-ARE YOU KIDDING?

23:58.349 --> 24:00.003
I HAVE TO FIGHT THEM OFF
WITH CHAIRS SOMETIMES.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.092
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU,

24:02.745 --> 24:04.878
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THINGS
LIKE THAT TO ATTRACT WOMEN.

24:05.008 --> 24:07.315
-OH PLEASE, GIVE ME A BREAK.

24:07.924 --> 24:08.795
MITCH.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.190
BOTH OF YOU, JUST
WAIT RIGHT THERE.

24:16.193 --> 24:18.457
-I'M REALLY SORRY, MITCH.
I HOPE I DIDN'T GET
YOU INTO ANY TROUBLE.

OF YOUR LIFEGUARDS, DONNA,

36:17.871 --> 36:19.177
SHE USED TO DO BIKINI CONTESTS.

36:19.307 --> 36:21.135
-OH YEAH. YEAH, RIGHT.

36:21.266 --> 36:24.007
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, SHE
ALWAYS FINISHED AHEAD OF YOU.

36:24.965 --> 36:26.793
-SAMANTHA: LET'S GET A FEW
WITH A JUDGE AND THE WINNER.

36:26.923 --> 36:28.186
THANK YOU.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.712
-MITCH: SO, WHAT DO
YOU SAY WE WRAP THIS UP

36:32.842 --> 36:34.844
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND
SKATE OUT OF HERE, HUH?

36:34.975 --> 36:36.455
-DON'T WAIT FOR ME.

36:36.585 --> 36:38.021
-NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.

36:38.152 --> 36:39.458
I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT
YOUR MOMENT IN THE SUN,

36:39.588 --> 36:40.633
BUT I'LL JUST KIND
OF WAIT OVER THERE.

36:40.763 --> 36:43.505
-NO, REALLY. DON'T WAIT FOR ME.

36:45.246 --> 36:47.292
-SAMANTHA: LET'S GET A
COUPLE MORE PICTURES, LADIES.

36:49.424 --> 36:50.817
AREN'T YOU GLAD WE DIDN'T BET?

36:50.947 --> 36:54.516
-SHE IS JUST PREOCCUPIED
BY WINNING, THAT'S ALL.

36:55.343 --> 36:57.302
-WELL, WINNING WAS
WHAT SHE WAS HERE TO DO.

36:57.432 --> 36:58.868
ALL SHE WAS HERE TO DO.

37:08.138 --> 37:09.357
-AUDREY: THANK YOU.

37:09.488 --> 37:11.968
-HEY, TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

37:12.099 --> 37:13.187
-FOR A SECOND.

37:13.318 --> 37:14.536
-SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:14.667 --> 37:15.450
I THOUGHT WE HAD
PLANS FOR THE NIGHT.

37:15.581 --> 37:16.408
SOMETHING CHANGE?

37:17.104 --> 37:19.454
-LOOK, MITCH,
YOU'RE REALLY SWEET.

37:19.585 --> 37:21.151
BUT HOW CAN I GO OUT WITH YOU,

37:21.282 --> 37:22.457
KNOWING THAT YOU
DIDN'T VOTE FOR ME.

37:23.371 --> 37:24.894
THAT YOU THOUGHT
SOMEONE ELSE WAS BETTER.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.549
IT'D JUST BE TOO UNCOMFORTABLE.

37:28.158 --> 37:30.291
-WHO TOLD YOU I
DIDN'T VOTE FOR YOU?

37:31.336 --> 37:33.120
-I SAW YOUR SCORECARD.

37:34.948 --> 37:36.341
-LIMO'S WAITING.

37:37.864 --> 37:39.344
-YOU KNOW, SAMANTHA WAS RIGHT.

37:39.474 --> 37:41.302
YOU DID ALLOW YOURSELF
TO BE INFLUENCED,

37:41.433 --> 37:42.695
BY HER.

37:43.783 --> 37:46.133
TOO BAD, I'D BEEN
A LOT MORE FUN.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.137
-I DOUBT IT.

37:52.879 --> 37:55.273
-I COULD TELL YOU WERE
VERY TALENTED THE SECOND

37:55.403 --> 37:56.796
I LAID EYES ON YOU.

37:57.362 --> 37:59.668
-THANK YOU. I'LL
JUST BE FIVE MINUTES.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.248
-WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

38:16.337 --> 38:18.600
-I DIDN'T VOTE FOR
HER AND SOMEBODY

38:18.731 --> 38:20.950
SHOWED HER MY SCORECARD.

38:21.081 --> 38:24.345
-OH, WELL THINK OF IT THIS WAY.

38:25.433 --> 38:28.567
AT LEAST NOW SHE'LL KNOW YOU
HAVE PRINCIPLES, AND INTEGRITY.

38:30.569 --> 38:31.526
-WAIT A MINUTE.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.660
IT WAS YOU, WASN'T IT?

38:34.790 --> 38:36.749
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE A SADIST.

38:37.706 --> 38:38.925
I CAN'T--

38:39.055 --> 38:40.013
-SAMANTHA: CAPTAIN
SADIST TO YOU.

38:40.143 --> 38:40.927
-HEY MITCH, HOW'S IT GOING?

38:41.057 --> 38:41.884
-WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

38:43.016 --> 38:44.191
-WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?

38:46.106 --> 38:48.238
-CAPTAIN THOMAS,
CAPTAIN THOMAS?

38:49.675 --> 38:52.634
SO, HOW'D THE PAY-PER-VIEW GO?

38:52.765 --> 38:54.636
