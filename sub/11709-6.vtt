BABY CARRIAGE.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.493
{\an8}YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD JUST
AT LEAST CHECK IT OUT.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.161

YOU COULD TAKE HER UP TO SEE IT.

13:49.537 --> 13:50.579
{\an8}I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.623
{\an8}- SHE CAN--
SHE CAN GO UPSTAIRS.

13:52.706 --> 13:55.709
{\an8}- IT IS A NICE GESTURE.
I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.337
{\an8}- I DON'T NEED A GESTURE,
I NEED AN APOLOGY

13:58.671 --> 14:01.674
{\an8}AND SAYING, "I WAS A DICK.
I MADE IT UP, SORRY."

14:01.757 --> 14:03.801

{\an8}- IT'S A SCHWINN CARRIAGE,
YOU KNOW...

14:11.684 --> 14:13.269
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
- WITH A SUN ROOF.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.063
{\an8}THAT'S PRETTY DOPE,
YOU'VE GOTTA GIVE HIM THAT.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.356
{\an8}- [burps]
- IT'S BETTER THAN THE FIRST CAR

14:17.648 --> 14:18.983
{\an8}THAT HE DROVE HERE.
- HE BOUGHT THIS?

14:19.316 --> 14:20.651
{\an8}- AND YOU CAN PUT YOUR WINE
IN THERE TOO.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.362
{\an8}- NO, RIGHT HERE.
- [laughs]

14:23.696 --> 14:25.614
{\an8}- THIS IS COOL.
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

14:25.698 --> 14:27.199
{\an8}- I GUESS,
'CAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW

14:27.616 --> 14:30.244
{\an8}HOW TO APOLOGIZE LIKE A HUMAN
BEING, SO BY BUYING STUFF,

14:30.536 --> 14:32.162
{\an8}THAT'S HIS WAY OF SAYING,
"I'M SORRY."

14:32.413 --> 14:33.539
{\an8}- DOESN'T MAKE IT BETTER.
LIKE, I--

14:33.622 --> 14:35.374
{\an8}- NO, I KNOW,
BUT IT'S COOL, RIGHT?

14:35.708 --> 14:38.002

HE WASN'T SUCH A DICK."

14:38.085 --> 14:39.503
{\an8}- IT'S PRETTY COOL.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.839
{\an8}I DEFINITELY LOVE THE STROLLER,
AND I--YOU KNOW,

14:41.922 --> 14:44.091
{\an8}I ENJOY THE FACT
THAT MIKE IS TRYING,

14:44.508 --> 14:47.595
{\an8}BUT HE'S TRYING IN A REALLY
WRONG WAY THAT IRRITATES ME.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.305

28:13.316 --> 28:15.443
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

28:15.527 --> 28:17.487

28:32.168 --> 28:33.336
{\an8}NOBODY'S
EVER DONE THAT.

28:33.628 --> 28:34.838
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I FIGURED, UM,

28:34.921 --> 28:36.089
{\an8}EVERY TIME,
I ALWAYS GO HOME WITH YOU,

28:36.381 --> 28:38.299
{\an8}SO WHY NOT
MAKE IT OFFICIAL?

28:38.550 --> 28:40.135
{\an8}- OH, I'M BLUSHING.

28:40.427 --> 28:42.262
{\an8}- MIKE AND PAULA
ARE A PERFECT MATCH.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.721
{\an8}THEY'RE BOTH
SPACE CADETS,

28:43.805 --> 28:45.807
{\an8}THEY BOTH SAY
THE STUPIDEST SHIT EVER,

28:45.890 --> 28:47.392
{\an8}AND THEY BOTH
HAVE THE ATTENTION SPAN

28:47.684 --> 28:49.102
{\an8}OF A GOLDFISH,
SO THEY'RE PERFECT.

28:49.436 --> 28:50.895
{\an8}- WHAT'S THIS STUFF?

28:51.271 --> 28:53.064
{\an8}- I'VE HAD THAT PIERCED

{\an8}- OH, WOW!

29:01.614 --> 29:03.491
{\an8}- WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,
I REALLY--

29:03.575 --> 29:05.785
{\an8}I WAS LIKE,
"I WANT THAT GIRL."

29:05.869 --> 29:07.454
{\an8}WE HAVE COME
A LONG WAY.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.205
{\an8}- I DON'T THINK I WOULD KNOW
HOW TO BE WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

29:09.497 --> 29:11.416
{\an8}DEFINITELY
DON'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.042
{\an8}- ME NEITHER.
- HONESTLY?

29:13.334 --> 29:16.671
{\an8}WE NEED TO GET YOU,
LIKE, A HOME.

29:16.754 --> 29:18.089
{\an8}AND A PUPPY.

29:18.381 --> 29:20.216
{\an8}GET THE HOUSE FIRST,
THEN THE PUPPY.

29:20.550 --> 29:23.636
{\an8}- I-I DON'T--I DON'T MAKE
RASH DECISIONS SOMETIMES.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.263
{\an8}- NO, I KNOW YOU DON'T,
BUT I'M TRYING

29:25.555 --> 29:27.223
{\an8}TO CONVINCE YOU TO.

29:27.307 --> 29:30.059
{\an8}- I WANT, LIKE, KIDS, MARRIAGE,
RELATIONSHIP, PUPPY, HOUSE.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.020
{\an8}[laughs]

29:32.103 --> 29:34.105
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT SOME KIDS
BUT DEFINITELY A PUPPY.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.440
{\an8}[chuckles]

29:35.732 --> 29:36.983
{\an8}- I COULD SEE YOU NOW
CHANGING DIAPERS.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.236
{\an8}"OH, HERE YOU GO. SOMEBODY--
SOMEBODY WANTS TO SEE YOU."

29:40.487 --> 29:41.946

YOU'RE FUNNY.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.531
{\an8}- I WANT TO GET MARRIED
IN A CHURCH.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.450
{\an8}- AS SOON AS I GAVE PAULA

{\an8}SHE STARTS TALKING
ABOUT KIDS,

29:48.411 --> 29:49.829
{\an8}FAMILY,
I'M LIKE,

29:49.913 --> 29:51.789
{\an8}"WHAT THE FUCK, GIRL?
CHILL!"

29:52.123 --> 29:53.374
{\an8}- DID YOU WANT A BOY OR A GIRL,
THOUGH?

29:53.625 --> 29:55.293
{\an8}- LISTEN.
[chuckles]

29:55.376 --> 29:56.544
{\an8}IF YOU THINK TOO FAR AHEAD, THEN
YOU'LL GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.296
{\an8}- YEAH, OBVIOUSLY.
I'M NOT GIVING YOU

29:58.588 --> 30:00.548
{\an8}MY OVULATION SCHEDULE
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.549
{\an8}- EW!

30:01.633 --> 30:02.967
{\an8}- OH, GOD.

AT THE RIGHT TIME.

30:18.816 --> 30:20.318
{\an8}- THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
[laughs]

30:20.610 --> 30:21.903
{\an8}- YOU GUYS LOOK DIFFERENT NOW.
YOU LOOK MORE MATURE.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.154
{\an8}- NOW THE FIGHTING STARTS.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.323
{\an8}[laughter]

30:25.657 --> 30:27.158
{\an8}- IT WAS GOOD
HAVING DINNER WITH Y'ALL.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.327
{\an8}- CAN I STEAL
THE SMUSH ROOM TONIGHT?

30:29.410 --> 30:30.787

30:42.215 --> 30:43.132
{\an8}- WOW!

30:43.383 --> 30:44.884
{\an8}- [sighs]

30:44.968 --> 30:47.762
{\an8}I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH PAULA RIGHT NOW.

30:47.845 --> 30:51.057
{\an8}"I GOT THE SMUSH ROOM.
SEX ON THE REG. THUG LIFE."

30:51.140 --> 30:53.601
{\an8}I'M HEARING THINGS
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.019
{\an8}WANT TO SLEEP
IN THE OTHER ROOM?

30:55.103 --> 30:57.146
{\an8}- YES, OF COURSE.
- ALL RIGHT.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.022
{\an8}- I'M LIKE
A FUCKING ANIMAL IN HEAT.

31:03.361 --> 31:05.863
{\an8}- I'D RATHER SLEEP
IN MY BED.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.365
{\an8}- HMM?
- I'D RATHER SLEEP IN MY BED.

31:07.657 --> 31:08.950
{\an8}I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP
IN THERE.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.535
{\an8}I REALLY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO ACT RIGHT NOW.

31:10.618 --> 31:14.622
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE PAULA'S EITHER,
"A," A LITTLE TOO EXCITED,

31:14.706 --> 31:17.375
{\an8}OR "B,"
JUST HAS NO FILTER RIGHT NOW,

31:17.667 --> 31:20.044
{\an8}AND I'M REALLY
NOT FEELING IT.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.297
{\an8}- COME HERE,
LET ME BANG YOU.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.591
{\an8}- OH, MY--

{\an8}[laughs]
- LIGHTS OUT.

31:30.805 --> 31:32.557
{\an8}- YEAH.
IT'S TIME TO GO TO BED.

31:32.849 --> 31:34.642
{\an8}- I WAS TALKING TOO MUCH AGAIN.
- TRUE.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.103
{\an8}- [laughs]

31:37.478 --> 31:40.231
{\an8}- I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
WE'RE GONNA--WHERE WE ARE.

31:40.481 --> 31:41.899
{\an8}- YOU SHOULD JUST HAVE
YOUR SUMMER

31:41.983 --> 31:43.234
{\an8}AND DO YOUR THING.
I DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF IT.

31:43.526 --> 31:44.902
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "DO MY--"

{\an8}- I'M DONE WITH YOU,

{\an8}- TODAY IS THE FOURTH DAY
SINCE I'VE TALKED TO ROGER.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.168
{\an8}I DIDN'T GET ANY SLEEP
LAST NIGHT

32:00.585 --> 32:03.379
{\an8}BECAUSE I JUST KEPT TOSSING
AND TURNING, THINKING THE WORST.

32:03.671 --> 32:05.590
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
IN ROGER'S HEAD.

32:05.673 --> 32:07.175
{\an8}LIKE,
DOES HE THINK WE'RE DONE?

32:07.508 --> 32:09.677
{\an8}THAT UNKNOWN FEELING
HAS MY HEAD SPINNING,

32:09.761 --> 32:12.805
{\an8}AND THE LACK OF SLEEP
REALLY IS JUST DRAINING ME.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.557
{\an8}[dial tone]
I'M GONNA GIVE IN.

32:14.641 --> 32:18.144
{\an8}WHAT'S HE THINKING?
WHY ISN'T HE CALLING ME?

32:18.227 --> 32:19.437
{\an8}I NEED ANSWERS.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.648
{\an8}[line ringing]

32:21.731 --> 32:23.232

VOICE MESSAGING SYSTEM.

{\an8}HE KNOWS I'M INJURED,

32:41.292 --> 32:44.671

OF NOTHINGNESS.
