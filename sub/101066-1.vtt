WEBVTT

03:35.967 --> 03:37.260
- Are you cold?
- I'm fine.

03:39.804 --> 03:41.097
I need to take a pee.

03:45.643 --> 03:46.978
You gonna stop?

03:55.820 --> 03:58.114
It's really sweet of you
to come with us.

03:58.990 --> 04:01.826
Anything for you, eh.
But only for you.

04:06.122 --> 04:10.501
Will you still love me afterwards?
I mean, without them.

04:11.669 --> 04:14.797
Without those two?
But of course.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.841
- Really?
- Of course, pookie bear.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.011
There's more to you
than your two boobs.

04:21.512 --> 04:24.306
And you're much more
than just your little beer belly.

04:24.307 --> 04:26.517
Don't be cheeky.

04:34.025 --> 04:35.125
Okay, we're off.

04:47.330 --> 04:50.416
- Lack of sugar?
- Yeah.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.420
That's great. Thank you.

05:01.177 --> 05:03.346
- What was that?
- I don't know.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.891
Did I hit something?

05:22.448 --> 05:23.908
What the hell's that?

05:27.578 --> 05:28.913
Oh no!

05:29.372 --> 05:31.582
Oh my God.

06:19.505 --> 06:22.424
I'll be glad when it'll be over
with those stupid looks.

06:22.425 --> 06:25.594
You should be happy
with what nature gave you, Alison.

06:25.595 --> 06:29.265
- You're one to talk.
- Yeah, and why not.

06:30.266 --> 06:33.144
And don't frown like that,
you'll get wrinkles.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.534
Give it a try.

06:54.624 --> 06:57.543
You really can pick 'em.

07:16.646 --> 07:18.439
It looked a lot nicer
on the website.

07:20.316 --> 07:22.318
Maybe that's why it's so cheap,
eh?

07:29.575 --> 07:31.868
Welcome at Klinika Krawczyk.

07:31.869 --> 07:34.037
Hi. I am Sylvia.

07:34.038 --> 07:35.538
Yes, of course, Sylvia.

07:35.539 --> 07:36.831
So nice to meet you.

07:36.832 --> 07:37.932
Please.

07:38.501 --> 07:41.461
Daniel, I would like you
to show rooms

07:41.462 --> 07:44.047
to everyone for liposculpture.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.966
Come with me, darling.

07:51.305 --> 07:54.683
Dr. Krawczyk is
very brilliant surgeon.

07:54.684 --> 07:58.186
He is developing a brand new
rejuvenation treatment,

07:58.187 --> 08:00.689
based on experimental
stem cell technology.

08:00.690 --> 08:02.607
This lady just had
chemical peeling

08:02.608 --> 08:05.819
to make skin look young again.

08:05.820 --> 08:08.405
I saw the result on the website.

08:08.406 --> 08:09.531
Amazing!

08:09.532 --> 08:12.659
I am sorry for staring,
but you have beautiful body.

08:12.660 --> 08:17.080
- Thank you.
- Did Dr. Krawczyk do them?

08:17.081 --> 08:19.708
Oh, no, no, no, they're mine.

08:23.254 --> 08:25.630
They seem a bit young for
plastic surgery.

08:25.631 --> 08:29.175
Teen pregnancies.
We give them free abortion.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.635
Oh, that's really nice.

08:30.636 --> 08:34.389
Eh, poepie?

08:34.390 --> 08:36.683
So, you will only
have grin lift?

08:36.683 --> 08:41.855
No, I have also tummy-tuck,
anal bleaching,

08:41.856 --> 08:44.899
Brazilian lift, and eyelids.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.946
Poepie?

08:49.947 --> 08:50.531
Pookie bear, are you okay?

08:50.532 --> 08:55.410
Is he all right?
He looks like he seen ghost.

08:55.411 --> 08:57.412
He was supposed
to become a doctor.

08:57.413 --> 08:58.513
- Mama, leave it.

08:58.539 --> 09:02.584
He dropped out of medical school
because he's afraid of blood.

09:02.585 --> 09:05.503
- Afraid of blood?
- Seriously?

09:05.504 --> 09:07.422
It's a condition.
A lot of people have it.

09:07.423 --> 09:09.007
It's called hemophobia.

09:09.008 --> 09:11.385
Oh.

09:21.520 --> 09:25.565
♪ We'll be in
a parcel by sunset ♪

09:25.566 --> 09:27.442
Is your song, no?

09:27.443 --> 09:28.985
Yeah.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.487
It's been a while.

09:30.488 --> 09:33.740
You're recovering well.
Very good.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.617
So...

09:35.618 --> 09:42.458
You are scheduled for next
treatment liposuction on...

09:43.876 --> 09:46.461
Alfred Schultz?

09:46.462 --> 09:48.713
But, uh, you are
William Maier, no?

09:48.714 --> 09:52.592
Yes, it's a privacy thing, okay?

09:52.593 --> 09:57.139
So, nobody knows you are here?

09:59.809 --> 10:00.643
I understand.

10:00.644 --> 10:05.105
Not good for image
of a famous person, huh?

10:05.106 --> 10:07.565
Don't worry.

10:07.566 --> 10:13.405
Nobody will ever know you are
here, Mr. Schultz.

10:14.365 --> 10:15.698
There's nothing wrong
with being gay.

10:15.699 --> 10:16.617
I mean, some of
my best friends are gay.

10:16.618 --> 10:20.120
No, hemophobia, not homophobia.

10:20.121 --> 10:22.123
Oh.

10:26.794 --> 10:30.630
Doctor, I like you to meet
lovely new guests.

10:30.631 --> 10:34.759
Oh, it's an honor to meet you,
Dr. Krawczyk.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.428
Beautiful ladies!

10:37.429 --> 10:40.598
I will make you
even more beautiful!

10:40.599 --> 10:42.851
Yes, yes.
This is Ms. Oksana.

10:42.852 --> 10:47.063
She's here for tattoo removal.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.774
May I?

11:10.754 --> 11:14.341
I would suggest G cup.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.844
No, no, no, I, uh...

11:17.845 --> 11:21.055
I want them smaller, not bigger.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.184
Oh, yes, of course.

11:24.143 --> 11:26.436
I thought a B.

11:26.437 --> 11:28.606
You know what I think,
you're crazy.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.733
B is a good size, no?
Mm-hmm.

11:31.734 --> 11:36.280
Of course, but I love you as you
are, pookie bear.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.365
If you want, we can do it.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.327
Yes, I want a B.

11:42.328 --> 11:42.786
Definitely a B.

11:42.787 --> 11:48.584
Okay, a B.
No problem, B, B.

11:54.924 --> 11:57.843
I've stopped, yet again.

11:58.594 --> 11:59.803
Nervous?

12:00.846 --> 12:05.434
- B's a nice size, right?
- Certainly. Absolutely.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.978
But I think that

12:08.979 --> 12:10.271
G cup is better, no?

12:10.272 --> 12:12.733
And I make you
even more beautiful.

12:23.327 --> 12:28.040
- Alison, I'd like to...
- Say goodbye to our twins?

12:28.499 --> 12:30.501
Erm, yeah.

12:45.767 --> 12:48.017
Cigarette?

12:48.018 --> 12:49.227
No, thank you.

12:49.228 --> 12:49.812
That's a smart boy.

12:49.813 --> 12:52.939
Are you having surgery today?

12:52.940 --> 12:53.941
- Me?
- Yeah.

12:53.941 --> 12:54.984
No, no.

12:54.985 --> 12:58.361
I thought... sorry.

12:58.362 --> 12:59.862
No, we're here for me.

12:59.863 --> 13:00.948
For you?

13:00.949 --> 13:06.327
Yeah, I'm having
a breast reduction.

13:06.328 --> 13:09.122
Really? Pity.

13:09.123 --> 13:11.624
You've got a body to die for.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.167
Why mess with God's work?

13:13.168 --> 13:14.794
Everybody says that, but...

13:14.795 --> 13:18.840
I mean I have back problems.
I can't run for the bus.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.091
Yeah.

13:20.092 --> 13:23.261
If you were my girlfriend,
I'd buy you a car.

13:23.262 --> 13:24.721
We have a car.

13:24.722 --> 13:26.139
Oh, yeah, I've seen it.

13:26.140 --> 13:27.598
An old timer, right?

13:27.599 --> 13:29.976
So, you work in the hospital?

13:29.977 --> 13:31.602
Mm-hmm.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.605
Does it have a good reputation?

13:34.606 --> 13:35.857
He's more nervous than you are.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.484
No, no, it's just that I mean...

13:38.485 --> 13:40.320
It's good men can't have babies.

13:40.321 --> 13:40.946
Humanity would go extinct.

13:40.947 --> 13:43.865
Yes, that's true.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.868
He's just joking, pookie bear.

13:47.745 --> 13:49.203
Poepie?

13:56.337 --> 13:59.297
This is for disinfection
of the incision area.

13:59.298 --> 14:01.759
Yes, I know, honey.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.775
Alison Jacobs?

14:18.776 --> 14:18.984
Yes.

14:18.985 --> 14:21.652
We will call you in one minute.

14:21.653 --> 14:24.072
Excuse me, don't you have to
check her blood type?

14:24.073 --> 14:25.991
That's not my job, sir.

14:28.577 --> 14:31.329
Uh, Doctor, do you know her
blood type at all?

14:31.330 --> 14:32.955
Mister, please, you wait
outside, yes?

14:32.956 --> 14:36.334
Isn't it prohibited to
drink coffee in an OR?

14:36.335 --> 14:38.086
Dr. Lenic he knows
what he's doing.

14:38.087 --> 14:39.796
He's a real professional.

14:39.797 --> 14:41.923
Yeah, according to EU
regulations, it's really not...

14:41.924 --> 14:43.132
Sit down, please.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.385
- Pookie bear, calm down.
- Yes, but...

14:45.386 --> 14:45.969
Can I get you something?

14:45.970 --> 14:47.887
I'm fine. Can't she just answer
a simple question?

14:47.888 --> 14:50.098
But you have
too many questions, yes?

14:50.099 --> 14:52.850
All information on website.

14:52.851 --> 14:53.894
Yeah, I've checked
the website, and it said nothing

14:53.895 --> 14:56.270
about what type of
anaesthesia or what happens

14:56.271 --> 14:57.730
with the glandular tissue.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.483
Are you a doctor?
No, but I've studied...

15:00.484 --> 15:01.068
...to be one, okay?

15:01.069 --> 15:02.194
Yeah, for a year.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.029
- Is that so important?
- It's true, isn't it?

15:04.030 --> 15:05.905
I can give you a tour
of the building.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.991
It's better than waiting
and getting nervous.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.618
That's a good idea.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.161
It's important that
your girlfriend

15:12.162 --> 15:13.788
is relaxed before surgery.

15:13.789 --> 15:16.124
It's fine, do it,
you'll only get stressed waiting here.

15:16.125 --> 15:18.043
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.467
It's okay.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.678
Did you know that in
China they already performed

15:28.679 --> 15:29.929
plastic surgery 2,000 years...

15:29.930 --> 15:31.097
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
I went to med school.

15:31.098 --> 15:35.143
Oh, yeah, for five minutes, no?

15:35.144 --> 15:35.978
But don't worry.

15:35.979 --> 15:40.106
Here the doctors did
finish their studies.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.200
Typical.

15:54.079 --> 15:56.414
Mobile please.

15:56.415 --> 15:59.125
Yes.
And also this...

15:59.126 --> 16:01.837
Okay.
Take off.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.632
And also this.

16:07.176 --> 16:09.594
So what's your job?

16:09.595 --> 16:11.596
You bring people to the airport?

16:11.597 --> 16:13.806
Travel agent.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.893
I've been working in this
country for a year now, but...

16:16.894 --> 16:19.228
you know the best
part of my job?

16:19.229 --> 16:20.730
The girls.

16:20.731 --> 16:23.733
After the treatment
they are always, you know...

16:23.734 --> 16:26.402
Ecstatic.

16:26.403 --> 16:31.157
They feel all yummy and sexy,
and they want affirmation.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.117
That's when I come in.

16:33.118 --> 16:36.455
Easy pussy.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.917
You know those
abortions they do here?

16:40.918 --> 16:43.544
They use the fetuses
for stem cell treatment.

16:43.545 --> 16:46.923
This experimental
stem cell stuff,

16:46.924 --> 16:49.550
none of that has been
proven to work, has it?

16:49.551 --> 16:51.427
Come on, man.

16:51.428 --> 16:54.056
It's all about money.

16:54.097 --> 16:57.559
Come.

16:59.353 --> 17:00.811
Excuse me?

17:00.812 --> 17:04.272
I thought Dr. Krawczyk
was doing the operation.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.109
No problem at all.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.280
You know, I want a B cup, eh?

17:11.281 --> 17:12.381
Mm-hmm.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.702
Okay.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.469
Are we allowed to be here?

17:34.888 --> 17:36.931
I promised Alison
I'd be there when she wakes up,

17:36.932 --> 17:38.182
- so...
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.226
In two hours.

17:39.227 --> 17:42.562
They've got plenty of work on
those bazookas of hers.

17:42.563 --> 17:44.021
Excuse me?

17:44.022 --> 17:46.440
Chill, man.
Come on, it was a compliment.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.776
She's gorgeous.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.194
How did you manage to
pick up a girl like that?

17:50.195 --> 17:53.447
Yeah, wouldn't you like to know.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.449
Rohypnol?

17:54.450 --> 17:56.868
Wait a moment.

18:13.385 --> 18:15.136
What are we doing here?

18:15.137 --> 18:16.721
Won't be long!

19:25.165 --> 19:27.166
Are you okay?

19:53.360 --> 19:56.821
Can you breathe?

19:56.822 --> 19:58.906
Shh, shh. Hold on. Hold on.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.241
I'm going to take it off
for you, okay?

20:00.242 --> 20:03.077
Shh, shh, shh.

20:03.078 --> 20:05.663
Okay.
It's gonna be okay.

20:05.664 --> 20:09.208
It's gonna be okay.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.398
What are you doing?

20:18.885 --> 20:22.096
I thought she couldn't breathe,

20:22.097 --> 20:23.639
and then I wanted to help her...

20:23.640 --> 20:26.475
Oh, we need to go.
Come, come, come.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.738
W-W-What the fuck was that?

20:38.739 --> 20:39.448
Did you know she was in there?

20:39.449 --> 20:41.532
No, no, of course not.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.743
Just what the fuck?

20:43.744 --> 20:44.411
Okay, I need to get to Alison.

20:44.412 --> 20:47.121
Which way to the surgery?
This way.

20:47.122 --> 20:48.831
But, hey, we were
never there, got it?

20:48.832 --> 20:52.293
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.

20:52.294 --> 20:55.129
You're in the best
place, in perfect hands.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.672
Two minutes, you'll
be sleeping like baby.

20:56.673 --> 20:57.923
When you wake up...

20:57.924 --> 20:59.592
Wait, stop.
Stop immediately.

20:59.593 --> 21:00.594
Bitanga.

21:00.595 --> 21:02.428
No, no, it's okay.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.722
Alison, wake up.

21:04.723 --> 21:05.557
- You, out.
- No, no, no.

21:05.558 --> 21:06.849
I'm not leaving without her.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.310
- Michael, what's going on?
- It's not okay, we're leaving now.

21:09.311 --> 21:12.355
- But why? It's my turn.
- If you'd prefer...

21:12.481 --> 21:14.273
Stop the operation
right now, okay?!

21:14.274 --> 21:18.779
Please, leave me alone!
No operation, no operation!

21:24.826 --> 21:26.286
Idiot.

21:27.162 --> 21:29.039
Are you alright, pookie bear?

22:27.889 --> 22:30.599
Are you feeling better now?

22:30.600 --> 22:33.102
Yeah, yeah.
Where is Alison?

22:33.103 --> 22:35.604
Getting ready for surgery.

22:35.605 --> 22:39.900
She had to wait because you made
mess in operation room.

22:41.486 --> 22:44.238
What is that?

22:44.239 --> 22:45.781
Huh?

22:45.782 --> 22:47.700
What is that?

22:54.708 --> 22:56.376
Good?

23:00.005 --> 23:02.298
Why am I tied up?

23:02.299 --> 23:04.383
You had panic attack.

23:04.384 --> 23:07.720
It's better you stay out
of operation room.

23:13.018 --> 23:15.561
Can you please untie me?

23:15.562 --> 23:18.272
Uh... are you more calm now?

23:18.273 --> 23:21.151
Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm chill.

23:22.569 --> 23:23.528
And stay in bed.

23:23.529 --> 23:28.199
You're still dizzy
from sedation.

23:34.831 --> 23:37.750
What?
What... what is happening?

23:37.751 --> 23:39.961
But... no, no.

23:41.713 --> 23:42.464
Stoj. Mister?
Can I help you?

23:42.465 --> 23:45.299
No, it's okay,
it's my girlfriend.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.177
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. Let me go.

23:48.178 --> 23:49.845
Hey, hey, don't touch her.
Don't touch.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.724
For God's sake, they just cleaned
everything up. Be calm.

23:53.183 --> 23:53.683
I am calm.

23:53.684 --> 23:54.808
You, out.

23:54.809 --> 23:56.143
Hey, I'm not
leaving without her.

23:56.478 --> 23:57.838
Oh great, now he's left,
well done!

23:59.564 --> 24:01.649
It's nothing to do with me,
there's things going on here.

24:01.650 --> 24:04.068
They were super friendly.

24:04.069 --> 24:04.861
Get out!

24:04.861 --> 24:05.862
Bloody hell!

24:05.863 --> 24:07.238
Where are you going?

24:12.535 --> 24:15.330
Alison, Alison.

24:17.707 --> 24:18.875
They're all leaving.

24:20.502 --> 24:23.004
Outside, and we're leaving too.

24:23.713 --> 24:25.507
- What about mama?
- We'll find her.

24:31.638 --> 24:36.558
It's, um, probably just
safety precaution.

24:36.559 --> 24:41.605
I saw...
I saw a man eating... a man.

24:41.606 --> 24:42.565
You saw a man eating what?

24:42.566 --> 24:44.733
Finish sentence.

24:48.905 --> 24:52.616
- What?
- We take the stairs.

24:52.617 --> 24:53.717
Let's go!

25:04.421 --> 25:07.465
Go, go, go.
Move, move, move, move.

25:36.119 --> 25:39.539
Sorry, uh, which way
to the recovery room?

25:44.754 --> 25:48.672
- Alison, there's an exit.
- I've got to find mama first.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.299
Mama's already outside.

25:50.300 --> 25:53.428
No, never without make-up.
I know she's still here.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.221
Alison, this really
isn't a good idea.

25:56.222 --> 25:57.223
Mama?

25:57.224 --> 25:58.724
Alison?

26:01.186 --> 26:04.814
Doctore! Doctore! Doctore!

26:09.569 --> 26:11.279
Mama?

26:33.843 --> 26:35.345
Don't pass out now.

26:40.558 --> 26:42.393
Stay away!

26:43.478 --> 26:44.729
Jesus Christ!

26:58.493 --> 26:59.868
Aaaah!

27:19.222 --> 27:23.393
Michael! No, no!

28:20.867 --> 28:23.327
Hey!

29:00.073 --> 29:01.173
Fuck.

29:41.322 --> 29:42.422
Aah!

29:46.661 --> 29:48.161
Relax.

29:48.162 --> 29:49.913
I'm not one of them.

29:49.914 --> 29:51.833
Okay.

29:54.544 --> 29:55.795
Shh.

30:05.513 --> 30:08.933
I've seen you on TV.

30:12.353 --> 30:14.855
Yeah, well...

30:14.856 --> 30:16.982
my visit here is...

30:16.983 --> 30:19.985
secret.

30:19.986 --> 30:21.945
Okay?

30:21.946 --> 30:24.782
No one will ever know.

30:25.783 --> 30:27.909
We're going to die here.

30:27.910 --> 30:30.954
Hey, don't say that.

30:30.955 --> 30:33.582
They'll send help, okay?

30:33.583 --> 30:35.208
Okay.
Don't worry.

30:35.209 --> 30:36.309
Okay.

31:05.114 --> 31:05.948
Help me!

31:05.949 --> 31:10.535
- What?
- It burns, it burns.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.120
What is this?

31:12.121 --> 31:13.872
Chemical skin peeling.

31:13.873 --> 31:19.127
Nurse got afraid and ran away.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.587
It hurts.

31:20.588 --> 31:23.423
Okay. Okay, we go.
Come.

31:23.424 --> 31:23.925
Let's go.

31:23.926 --> 31:27.594
We're going to look for water.

31:27.595 --> 31:29.346
Come, come.

31:31.849 --> 31:33.600
Scheisse!

31:33.601 --> 31:34.935
Okay, come.

31:39.899 --> 31:42.651
What? Come on.
Please, we need water.

31:42.652 --> 31:46.822
Let us in!
Come on, please!

31:46.823 --> 31:47.948
Help me!

31:47.949 --> 31:52.035
Come on, let us in!
We need water! She's in pain!

31:52.036 --> 31:53.412
They need help.

31:53.413 --> 31:55.705
No, they're wounded,
they're infected.

31:55.706 --> 31:56.749
They will kill us!

31:56.750 --> 31:58.959
She's not infected!

31:58.960 --> 32:00.044
Go away!

32:00.045 --> 32:02.421
We've got knives,
and we will use them!

32:02.422 --> 32:03.713
It hurts!

32:03.714 --> 32:04.966
Where are you going?
Wait! Wait!

32:12.473 --> 32:15.183
You...

32:15.184 --> 32:17.520
you saved my life.

32:19.230 --> 32:21.691
Yeah, well...

32:23.109 --> 32:26.153
Wait!

32:56.058 --> 32:58.519
Mama.

33:02.024 --> 33:04.192
Oh mama, wake up.

33:05.026 --> 33:09.405
Mama, wake up. Mama, come on.
Wake up!

33:21.125 --> 33:22.225
He's dead, mama.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.590
Michael is dead.

33:28.424 --> 33:31.260
Mama, come on, wake up!

33:37.433 --> 33:39.476
Okay.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.719
Ally?

34:55.719 --> 34:57.346
Shhh.

35:10.234 --> 35:12.152
Oh, fuck.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.275
Aaaah!

36:05.331 --> 36:09.167
Are you okay?

36:09.168 --> 36:11.128
Come.

36:23.474 --> 36:24.574
Thanks.

36:28.313 --> 36:30.480
Oh, shit.

36:30.481 --> 36:32.315
We'll be fine.

36:36.529 --> 36:38.488
I don't want to die.

36:38.489 --> 36:40.448
Me neither.

36:40.449 --> 36:42.367
Like virgin.

36:42.368 --> 36:44.245
Yeah... what?

36:48.749 --> 36:50.583
This is not the time to...

36:50.584 --> 36:52.878
Why not?

36:54.422 --> 36:55.381
You're right.

36:55.382 --> 36:59.342
We should make the best of
the little time we have left.

37:04.140 --> 37:07.768
I always imagined it would be
on a beach, you know?

37:10.271 --> 37:14.649
Listen, you have
to be gentle with me.

37:14.650 --> 37:16.861
Why?

37:20.322 --> 37:23.700
What happened?

37:23.701 --> 37:25.952
Penis enlargement.

37:25.953 --> 37:27.871
A while ago, a small one.

37:27.872 --> 37:30.249
A-a small enlargement.

37:33.127 --> 37:36.087
I'm not yet supposed to.

37:36.088 --> 37:39.174
But for you, I will try.

37:39.175 --> 37:42.803
We just have to be careful.

37:44.430 --> 37:45.389
Okay.

37:45.390 --> 37:48.308
I guess.

39:27.658 --> 39:28.758
Alison.

39:32.496 --> 39:36.249
The big fella
is looking much better.

39:36.250 --> 39:38.167
I'll just clean him up a bit.

39:38.168 --> 39:39.586
Can you get me a towel?

39:39.587 --> 39:42.589
Yes.

39:45.926 --> 39:46.427
Please stay quiet.

39:46.428 --> 39:51.180
Aah! It's burning hot!
I burned myself. Fuck!

39:51.181 --> 39:52.974
Wait.

39:52.975 --> 39:54.475
Here, I think this is for burns.

39:54.476 --> 39:56.395
Ah.

39:59.315 --> 40:02.609
Ah. What kind of
a cock shit cream is this?

40:02.610 --> 40:04.611
It smells fucked up.

40:04.612 --> 40:07.780
Can't read it.

40:07.781 --> 40:09.073
Here, let me...

40:09.074 --> 40:10.533
Fucking caveman alphabet.

40:10.534 --> 40:13.828
Oi.
Aaah!

40:13.829 --> 40:15.622
Put it out!
Put it out!

40:15.623 --> 40:17.457
Okay.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.584
Wait!

40:19.585 --> 40:22.963
Stop moving.

40:26.508 --> 40:30.971
Stop! Stop! Stop!

40:39.063 --> 40:42.024
I can't feel it anymore.

40:59.917 --> 41:01.709
It was accident.

41:01.710 --> 41:02.835
I-I'm sorry.

41:02.836 --> 41:04.462
Get the fuck out of my way!

41:04.463 --> 41:06.839
No. No!

41:06.840 --> 41:09.509
Fuck off!
I need a doctor! Now!

41:09.510 --> 41:11.552
No, no!

43:26.855 --> 43:29.565
W-What is happening?
Have you seen my girlfriend?

43:29.566 --> 43:32.026
What girlfriend?
Lots of girlfriends here.

43:32.027 --> 43:33.528
The one with breast reduction.

43:33.529 --> 43:36.155
Yeah.
Probably dead.

43:36.156 --> 43:37.365
Dead?

43:39.201 --> 43:41.744
We go.

43:41.745 --> 43:44.206
Come.

43:45.833 --> 43:48.417
Okay.

43:51.797 --> 43:54.799
Oh, shit!

44:04.268 --> 44:07.103
- Come.
- Okay.

44:07.104 --> 44:09.647
Come quick.

44:09.648 --> 44:10.748
Go, go.

44:12.151 --> 44:13.776
Put her down there.

44:20.325 --> 44:22.702
What the hell is happening here?

44:22.703 --> 44:25.788
God is punishing us for
interfering with his creation.

44:25.789 --> 44:28.916
Oh, please. We just
have to get out of here.

44:28.917 --> 44:30.543
Impossible.

44:30.544 --> 44:32.920
Everybody on
ground floor is infected.

44:37.718 --> 44:41.305
Mama, look at me.
Do you think you can walk unaided?

44:41.805 --> 44:44.433
Why? We came in the car.

44:47.311 --> 44:50.105
Shit! Shit!

44:57.321 --> 44:59.197
There's no signal.

45:13.962 --> 45:15.464
Move.

45:19.760 --> 45:21.385
Thank you.

45:35.734 --> 45:38.570
Move.

45:39.947 --> 45:41.739
Mm!

45:41.740 --> 45:45.535
Shit.

45:54.503 --> 45:57.088
I thought you were dead.

45:57.089 --> 45:58.189
Poepie?

46:02.970 --> 46:04.553
Apologize, my friend.

46:04.554 --> 46:05.805
I thought you were them.

46:05.806 --> 46:08.350
It's okay.

46:10.227 --> 46:12.270
She has virus.

46:12.271 --> 46:16.816
What? No, I have
been operated.

46:16.817 --> 46:20.528
I-I feel fine.

46:20.529 --> 46:23.030
Well, I'm healthy.

46:23.031 --> 46:24.699
I'm dizzy. Just dizzy.

46:24.700 --> 46:26.993
I need my makeup,
Ally, I'm right.

46:26.994 --> 46:28.661
She is in first stage.

46:28.662 --> 46:30.538
It would be best to end
suffering now.

46:30.539 --> 46:32.373
What?
You cannot just kill her.

46:33.750 --> 46:35.167
She is a danger to us all.

46:35.168 --> 46:37.295
See? She's changing now.

46:37.296 --> 46:37.838
We cannot wait.

46:37.839 --> 46:41.465
No, no. I'm sorry.
It's just my stomach.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.092
Just quick blow on the head.

46:43.093 --> 46:43.844
No. You stay away
from my mother.

46:43.845 --> 46:46.971
It will be almost painless,
I promise.

46:46.972 --> 46:48.072
No.

46:49.266 --> 46:51.518
Somebody hold her.

46:54.146 --> 46:55.980
Fine, I can do it like this.

46:55.981 --> 46:59.608
No, no!

46:59.609 --> 47:01.028
Aaah!

47:09.870 --> 47:13.539
Now you're infected, too.

47:13.540 --> 47:14.041
Do we have to kill you, too?

47:14.042 --> 47:18.627
No, no, no.
I have not been bitten.

47:18.628 --> 47:22.340
It's less urgent with me.

47:22.341 --> 47:22.883
Kurwa!

47:22.884 --> 47:25.384
No, no!

47:25.385 --> 47:27.428
Okay, okay.

47:27.429 --> 47:29.638
Okay.
Okay. Okay.

47:29.639 --> 47:33.434
Maybe we can create vaccine.

47:33.435 --> 47:35.603
What?
You almost killed my...

47:35.604 --> 47:38.522
You really think there is
treatment for this?

47:38.523 --> 47:42.193
I need to get to the pharmacy.

47:42.194 --> 47:42.861
Okay.
Can we go there?

47:42.862 --> 47:45.196
This way.

48:09.930 --> 48:12.099
Hurry up!

48:25.570 --> 48:27.571
Hurry, hurry.

48:27.572 --> 48:28.989
They're down there, quick.

48:55.517 --> 48:56.976
- Hurry.
- Okay, come on.

48:56.977 --> 49:00.062
Lock the door, lock the door!

49:00.063 --> 49:02.023
Michael, help me.

49:05.944 --> 49:08.947
Put her down before
she starts to bite.

49:11.491 --> 49:13.409
Okay, okay.

49:13.410 --> 49:14.743
Here.

49:14.744 --> 49:18.330
Yonah, let's try complera.

49:18.331 --> 49:19.790
But use a saline.

49:19.791 --> 49:20.041
Complera intravenously?

49:20.042 --> 49:22.793
We have no time to play safe.

49:22.794 --> 49:24.170
We need intravenous injection.

49:24.171 --> 49:25.588
Mama?

49:25.589 --> 49:27.214
Ally?
Yeah.

49:30.010 --> 49:33.262
I can make a sterile
solution if you want.

49:33.263 --> 49:34.722
Do it!

49:34.723 --> 49:38.768
Look at me, Mama.

49:45.734 --> 49:47.651
Get me a syringe.

49:47.652 --> 49:50.196
Okay.
Let's try this.

50:09.591 --> 50:10.675
Mama?

50:10.676 --> 50:13.219
Mama?

50:13.220 --> 50:14.179
Careful, she's changing.

50:14.180 --> 50:18.307
Maybe we try Neuraminidase
blocker with AZT?

50:18.308 --> 50:23.437
No, no, no. It doesn't
affect the RNA polymerase.

50:23.438 --> 50:26.815
So, you know virus?

50:26.816 --> 50:29.026
We are in a hurry, okay?

50:29.027 --> 50:32.780
Get me some Cytosine
and a syringe.

50:32.781 --> 50:36.618
I'm still here, I'm here mama.

50:41.289 --> 50:43.625
I'm here, alright?
Look at me.

50:44.668 --> 50:47.878
- Yeah.
- Here's the syringe.

50:47.879 --> 50:51.131
We have to draw blood.

50:51.132 --> 50:52.675
Hold her head!

50:52.676 --> 50:54.218
Be careful!

50:54.219 --> 50:56.096
Vicious bitch.

51:00.600 --> 51:03.478
Got it. Okay.

51:10.694 --> 51:12.903
Yonah, please make
a new protein base.

51:12.904 --> 51:14.113
This one is off.
It's no use.

51:14.114 --> 51:16.615
- I'll do it.
- We have to save

51:16.616 --> 51:19.118
woman and everyone else.
She is lost.

51:19.119 --> 51:21.620
Yonah, I am your boss.

51:21.621 --> 51:24.373
You are in my country,
you work in my hospital.

51:24.374 --> 51:25.916
Listen to me!

51:25.917 --> 51:29.253
First, I want explanation.

51:29.254 --> 51:35.676
Is virus created in special
youth treatment program?

51:35.677 --> 51:38.637
You were secretly
treating people here.

51:38.638 --> 51:40.180
They did not know?

51:40.181 --> 51:42.641
Okay, okay.

51:42.642 --> 51:45.436
Patient Zero,
she was also in program,

51:45.437 --> 51:46.313
but she was contained.

51:46.314 --> 51:51.734
I don't know how
she could get out.

51:51.735 --> 51:55.237
Somehow, I just wanted
to make people happy.

51:55.238 --> 51:58.866
That's why we did
this enzyme experiment,

51:58.867 --> 52:00.993
to stop aging.

52:00.994 --> 52:04.163
To make the world
look more beautiful.

52:13.882 --> 52:16.300
Better he dies like man,
not like animal.

52:16.301 --> 52:19.803
What have you done?

52:19.804 --> 52:23.182
He was infected, and much
stronger than woman.

52:23.183 --> 52:25.267
We could not longer take
any risks, or we would all die.

52:25.268 --> 52:29.189
But he was the only one who
could find a cure.

52:32.192 --> 52:35.110
Maybe we can, Yonah.

52:35.111 --> 52:38.782
What if we mix the complera
with the rilpivirine?

52:45.330 --> 52:47.832
Mama.

52:52.087 --> 52:53.713
Mama.

53:00.178 --> 53:01.387
Get me diarylprimidine.

53:01.388 --> 53:03.472
Okay.

53:11.481 --> 53:14.233
The syringe.
Yeah.

53:14.234 --> 53:16.735
Here.

53:20.365 --> 53:21.449
Hold head.

53:21.450 --> 53:23.158
Okay.

53:42.971 --> 53:45.264
Quick, I need amputation
before virus spreads!

53:45.265 --> 53:46.849
Okay.

53:46.850 --> 53:48.392
Chop it off!

53:48.393 --> 53:49.643
Ready?

53:49.644 --> 53:51.812
Do it!

53:53.106 --> 53:55.275
- Son of bitch.
- Oh, shit.

53:56.276 --> 53:59.987
Be quick! Be quick!
Hurry! Please.

53:59.988 --> 54:02.281
- Go. Please
- No time.

54:02.282 --> 54:05.910
Virus will reach my brain.

54:21.342 --> 54:24.720
That's how you do it!

54:24.721 --> 54:26.680
Oh, God!

54:26.681 --> 54:28.265
Oh, God! Aaah!
Oh, God!

54:28.266 --> 54:31.685
Oh, turn it off!
Of, fuck!

54:31.686 --> 54:32.895
Aaah!

55:01.382 --> 55:05.427
- She's getting loose.
- Please, put this woman

55:05.428 --> 55:07.012
out of misery.

55:07.013 --> 55:10.892
Michael, kill her now!

55:17.690 --> 55:19.399
Oh...

55:19.400 --> 55:21.819
Okay.

55:25.406 --> 55:27.115
Do it!

55:27.116 --> 55:28.909
What are you waiting for?

55:28.910 --> 55:31.453
Michael, kill her now!

55:31.454 --> 55:32.554
Do it!

55:39.505 --> 55:43.340
Come on, do it!

55:50.640 --> 55:52.392
Sorry, Ma.

55:53.393 --> 55:56.395
But why did you have to insist
on always looking like

55:56.396 --> 56:00.108
a fucking teenage whore!

56:54.579 --> 56:57.331
Shh.

57:07.508 --> 57:11.386
Guys, we have to leave.

57:27.779 --> 57:29.780
Shit.

57:29.781 --> 57:31.448
No!

57:31.449 --> 57:32.866
There is no key.

57:32.867 --> 57:35.953
We are so fucked.

57:46.507 --> 57:49.300
What you got?

57:57.892 --> 57:59.476
You stupid junky.

57:59.477 --> 58:02.104
So what?

58:02.105 --> 58:05.399
You just killed someone, bitch.

58:05.400 --> 58:07.275
Do we have some iodine?

58:07.276 --> 58:09.653
We just have to get
the fuck out of here.

58:09.654 --> 58:13.240
This will get us
the fuck out of here.

58:13.241 --> 58:15.033
You're kidding, no?

58:15.034 --> 58:15.576
No.
Iodine and ammonia.

58:15.577 --> 58:17.703
This will blow open the door.

58:17.704 --> 58:20.206
Clever.

58:22.709 --> 58:24.960
This'll work.

58:24.961 --> 58:25.628
Will that be powerful
enough, pookie?

58:25.629 --> 58:28.463
You bet your ass.

58:28.464 --> 58:30.173
- Come on.
- Okay, watch out, watch out.

58:30.174 --> 58:32.427
This will cause quite a blast.

58:34.637 --> 58:36.805
Oh, pitchka.

58:36.806 --> 58:38.557
It's a fucking sliding door.

58:49.652 --> 58:52.363
Okay.

58:57.910 --> 58:58.578
Michael!

58:58.579 --> 59:00.788
Hang on, I'm coming.

59:07.712 --> 59:09.422
Whoa!

59:53.216 --> 59:54.925
I got one of
those motherfuckers.

59:54.926 --> 59:56.761
We can go down
at the other side.

01:00:19.826 --> 01:00:20.926
Come on.

01:00:31.129 --> 01:00:34.215
Come on. Hurry.

01:00:37.426 --> 01:00:39.594
Fuck.

01:00:39.595 --> 01:00:40.929
Hold on.

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:42.222
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:00:42.223 --> 01:00:43.323
Hurry.

01:00:44.225 --> 01:00:45.350
Take my hand.

01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:47.060
No, no, no.

01:00:54.193 --> 01:00:57.237
Oh, shit.

01:01:30.897 --> 01:01:32.815
Oh, pitchka.

01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:54.794
Do you mind?

01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:01.260
Oh, yeah.

01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:04.221
You completely forgot
I understand a bit

01:02:04.222 --> 01:02:07.516
of your monkey language, huh?

01:02:09.769 --> 01:02:14.940
I heard what Dr. Crapshit said
just before you killed him.

01:02:14.941 --> 01:02:18.777
I know that
the anonymous patients' program

01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:20.237
was your idea.

01:02:22.782 --> 01:02:26.952
You are responsible
for this shit.

01:02:26.953 --> 01:02:31.248
So...

01:02:31.249 --> 01:02:33.626
Is this what you want?

01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:37.630
I prefer my pussy a bit younger.

01:02:48.182 --> 01:02:50.600
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:52.227
Can I?
Mm-hmm.

01:02:52.228 --> 01:02:54.188
Thanks.

01:02:56.274 --> 01:02:58.400
Are you okay?

01:03:03.322 --> 01:03:04.949
No.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.159
Come on.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.871
Oh, come, come here.

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:16.334
Thank you.

01:03:16.335 --> 01:03:18.128
You're welcome.

01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:22.550
Come. Let's go.
Follow me.

01:03:34.186 --> 01:03:36.980
Oh, fuck.

01:03:40.693 --> 01:03:44.154
This is the only way out.

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:47.157
Oh, perfect.

01:03:47.158 --> 01:03:48.868
- It leads down.
- I will go first.

01:04:03.966 --> 01:04:05.066
Oh, shit.

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.320
Sorry.

01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:25.404
Michael?

01:04:36.999 --> 01:04:38.000
Oh, shit.

01:04:38.001 --> 01:04:39.752
Michael?

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:42.004
Hang on a moment!

01:04:45.925 --> 01:04:47.634
Hey, don't come!

01:04:47.635 --> 01:04:48.885
What did he say?

01:04:48.886 --> 01:04:49.887
Come down?

01:04:49.888 --> 01:04:52.889
Okay.

01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:55.642
Ugh!

01:04:55.643 --> 01:04:56.743
Damn it.

01:04:57.645 --> 01:04:59.146
Why did you say I should come?

01:05:03.234 --> 01:05:04.943
You know what?

01:05:04.944 --> 01:05:06.820
50,000.

01:05:06.821 --> 01:05:07.113
What?

01:05:07.114 --> 01:05:10.490
50,000 for not
telling everyone about

01:05:10.491 --> 01:05:12.909
the crazy stuff you made
the doctor do here.

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:14.077
I think it's fair.

01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:16.287
It's not the time.

01:05:16.288 --> 01:05:19.124
Oh, really?
Why not?

01:05:19.125 --> 01:05:20.917
40,000, okay?

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:24.337
Mm, no.

01:05:24.338 --> 01:05:25.964
50,000 is okay.

01:05:25.965 --> 01:05:26.966
Deal?

01:05:26.966 --> 01:05:28.008
Deal.
Okay.

01:05:28.009 --> 01:05:30.218
Go.

01:05:30.219 --> 01:05:31.319
Aah!

01:05:40.229 --> 01:05:43.773
Michael, come on!

01:05:46.277 --> 01:05:47.402
Okay.

01:05:47.403 --> 01:05:50.030
Help me!

01:05:52.366 --> 01:05:54.075
Help!

01:05:55.453 --> 01:05:57.203
Help me!

01:05:57.204 --> 01:05:58.956
Help!

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:01.959
Hello? Help me!

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.043
- Now what?
- We have to help her.

01:06:04.044 --> 01:06:07.381
Help me!

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:10.968
Help!

01:06:10.969 --> 01:06:15.013
Help me!

01:06:15.014 --> 01:06:16.848
Help!

01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:19.894
Help me!

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:26.859
Help!

01:06:27.735 --> 01:06:28.835
Hey moron.

01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:39.765
Thank you.

01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:45.145
- Come.
- Daniel, come.

01:07:47.273 --> 01:07:49.482
Thank you so much.

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:52.069
It's okay.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.531
Yeah, what?

01:08:01.787 --> 01:08:03.580
Oh, my God.

01:08:03.581 --> 01:08:05.123
Are you okay?

01:08:05.124 --> 01:08:07.710
You fucking bitch.

01:08:08.377 --> 01:08:10.086
- We have to go.
- No, no, no.

01:08:11.714 --> 01:08:13.214
Daniel?

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:31.357
It, uh... it attacked her.

01:08:31.358 --> 01:08:33.109
It got her.

01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:35.988
There was nothing I could do.

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:39.240
And you... are you okay?

01:08:39.241 --> 01:08:41.451
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

01:08:41.452 --> 01:08:43.243
Okay.

01:08:43.245 --> 01:08:45.121
We must go.

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:47.415
Come.

01:08:47.416 --> 01:08:48.515
Come!

01:09:03.057 --> 01:09:05.225
Finally!

01:09:07.353 --> 01:09:10.897
Hello! Over here!

01:09:22.618 --> 01:09:23.718
No, wait, wait!

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.261
Because risk of contamination,

01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:45.515
everyone who tries to
leave will be sh...

01:09:58.404 --> 01:10:01.323
Quick, quick!

01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:23.302
Aah!

01:10:43.741 --> 01:10:45.783
Go, go!

01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:49.412
Help me move this shit.

01:10:52.374 --> 01:10:55.127
Come on, hurry up.

01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:58.296
Look.

01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:22.628
Fuck.

01:11:22.905 --> 01:11:24.447
What's the matter?

01:11:26.158 --> 01:11:27.575
I got bitten by that beast.

01:11:27.576 --> 01:11:28.676
Let's keep moving.

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.955
You're bitten?

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:34.374
You think I'm infected?

01:11:34.458 --> 01:11:37.752
But it's... it's not
a human bite.

01:11:37.753 --> 01:11:40.254
An animal can infect
you just as well.

01:11:40.255 --> 01:11:41.131
Come on.

01:11:41.132 --> 01:11:42.883
Wait, wait, Alison.

01:11:47.429 --> 01:11:48.669
If we come out of this alive...

01:11:51.183 --> 01:11:53.435
- Will you...
- Are you serious?

01:11:54.728 --> 01:11:56.897
In this sewer you mean?

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.485
Come on, guys.

01:12:24.466 --> 01:12:28.553
Come on. Come on.

01:12:28.554 --> 01:12:30.888
- Wait!
- No, come on.

01:12:30.889 --> 01:12:32.808
No, look!

01:12:56.456 --> 01:13:00.626
We have to move.
If we stay, we all die.

01:13:04.506 --> 01:13:09.385
No, it's alright. You go.
It's okay, go.

01:13:09.386 --> 01:13:11.262
Now!

01:13:11.263 --> 01:13:12.597
Wait, wait!
Fuck.

01:13:12.598 --> 01:13:15.142
No one's going to die.

01:13:17.644 --> 01:13:19.520
You can do it.

01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:22.524
- I studied to do this.
- No!

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:33.784
Fuck it.

01:13:46.423 --> 01:13:47.523
Here.

01:13:55.015 --> 01:13:59.018
- I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.
- It's okay, pookie bear.

01:13:59.019 --> 01:14:00.119
You were right...

01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:04.690
- There's nothing wrong with an F cup.
- Not now, Alison.

01:14:04.691 --> 01:14:05.891
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:08.569
Guys, I've found another way.

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:11.447
I need your help.
Come on.

01:14:11.448 --> 01:14:14.284
Here.

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:21.208
Here. It's here.

01:14:24.586 --> 01:14:25.587
- Go, go.
- Okay.

01:14:25.588 --> 01:14:27.589
Go, come on!

01:14:28.757 --> 01:14:31.425
Go!

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:36.739
Okay.

01:14:37.516 --> 01:14:40.602
Come on pookie bear, push!

01:14:59.622 --> 01:15:03.917
Yeah!

01:15:10.716 --> 01:15:14.136
Only one of us can get up there.

01:15:15.762 --> 01:15:18.556
You don't look too good.

01:15:18.557 --> 01:15:21.183
How do you feel?

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:22.935
I'm infected, I guess.

01:15:22.936 --> 01:15:25.688
I'll make sure she survives.

01:15:27.941 --> 01:15:28.942
Okay, you go.

01:15:28.943 --> 01:15:30.818
Help me.

01:15:30.819 --> 01:15:32.653
Go.

01:15:42.497 --> 01:15:44.624
Michael?

01:16:02.517 --> 01:16:03.726
No!
Move, move move.

01:16:03.727 --> 01:16:05.811
It's too late,
it's too late. Go, go, go.

01:16:05.812 --> 01:16:07.021
No, no!

01:16:08.066 --> 01:16:09.774
Poepie! Michael! No!

01:16:09.775 --> 01:16:10.900
Look at me.
Look at me.

01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:12.001
- No!
- Look at me.

01:16:13.445 --> 01:16:14.612
He was infected.
No.

01:16:14.613 --> 01:16:15.905
It's better this way.

01:16:15.906 --> 01:16:18.657
You don't have to watch him
turn into a monster, okay?

01:16:18.658 --> 01:16:20.701
Okay.

01:17:20.804 --> 01:17:22.721
Wait! Wait for me!

01:17:22.722 --> 01:17:26.101
Daniel, catch!

01:17:33.733 --> 01:17:36.443
You've been bitten.

01:17:36.444 --> 01:17:39.363
You're infected, too.
You...

01:17:39.364 --> 01:17:40.464
You motherfucker.

01:17:41.074 --> 01:17:42.174
You bastard.

01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:53.210
Alison!

01:18:01.678 --> 01:18:03.679
Okay, come on.
No!

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.556
No, I don't want go!

01:18:05.557 --> 01:18:06.807
Alison.
Let me explain this to you.

01:18:06.808 --> 01:18:08.100
No!

01:18:08.101 --> 01:18:11.270
You have to survive this, huh?

01:18:11.271 --> 01:18:13.731
That's what he wanted for you,
that you stay alive.

01:18:13.732 --> 01:18:18.695
Okay?

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:21.655
Okay.

01:18:21.656 --> 01:18:23.073
Come on.

01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:25.552
Can you drive?

01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:26.763
It hurts too much.

01:19:31.351 --> 01:19:34.436
Are you okay?

01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:34.938
You look like shit.

01:19:34.939 --> 01:19:37.773
No, no, I'm fine.

01:19:37.774 --> 01:19:41.068
You can relax now.
We made it.

01:19:41.069 --> 01:19:43.822
We are alive.

01:19:44.948 --> 01:19:48.450
You were infected
the whole time?

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:50.744
I'm still me, but not for long.

01:19:50.745 --> 01:19:51.912
What the fuck? Stop.
No.

01:19:51.913 --> 01:19:53.872
This is the last thing
I want to do before I die.

01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:56.000
No! No!

01:19:56.001 --> 01:19:56.918
No, get off of me!

01:19:56.919 --> 01:20:00.713
Let me finally
feel those knockers.

01:20:00.714 --> 01:20:02.006
- No!
- Oh, fuck.

01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:05.802
Shit.

01:20:05.803 --> 01:20:08.512
Go.

01:20:08.513 --> 01:20:10.014
You want me to bite you?

01:20:10.015 --> 01:20:14.893
Because that will happen
if you keep on wasting our time.

01:20:27.866 --> 01:20:29.867
Oh, shit.

01:20:41.338 --> 01:20:43.130
Shit.

01:21:25.423 --> 01:21:27.132
Okay.

01:22:32.157 --> 01:22:36.369
Come on, bitch,
we're going to hell together.

01:24:28.982 --> 01:24:31.108
Poepie?

01:26:30.186 --> 01:26:33.230
Patient Zero,
she was also in program,

01:26:33.231 --> 01:26:35.107
but she was contained.

01:26:35.108 --> 01:26:38.902
I don't know how
she could get out.

01:26:38.903 --> 01:26:42.656
Somehow, I just wanted
to make people happy.

01:26:42.657 --> 01:26:45.283
That's why we did
this enzyme experiment,

01:26:45.284 --> 01:26:48.161
to stop aging.

01:26:48.162 --> 01:26:52.374
To make the world
look more beautiful.

01:26:55.169 --> 01:27:00.424
To make the world
look more beautiful.

01:27:35.084 --> 01:28:04.321
To make the world
look more beautiful.
