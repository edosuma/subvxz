WEBVTT

02:06.418 --> 02:07.502
Don?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.798
What do you think?

02:12.132 --> 02:16.594
Now, it may take a moment to get used to.
l told you, men don't like change.

02:16.678 --> 02:20.306
Well, it's hard for me to judge
when l can't see a price tag.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.850
A modern Chinoiserie breakfront,

02:22.935 --> 02:25.978
a Dunbar, Japanese-influenced sofa,

02:26.063 --> 02:29.482
silk Dupioni drapes, Murano vases,

02:29.900 --> 02:32.235
and a classic Drexel end table.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.614
-And what goes here?
-Where?

02:37.241 --> 02:39.325
Right where we're standing.

02:39.409 --> 02:43.412
Well, that's your hearth, darling.
That's the soul of your home.

02:43.747 --> 02:47.041
People gather around a fire
even if there isn't one.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.212
-So, Don?
-l think it's fine, Betts.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.340
All you do at work all day
is evaluate objects.

02:54.424 --> 02:57.051
l would like the benefit of your eye.

03:02.099 --> 03:05.935
Move the end table and the lamp
to the other end of the couch.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.943
l think he's right.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.828
-Hot as hell already.
-Yes, it is.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.207
l watched the sunrise today. Couldn't sleep.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.084
-How was it?
-Average.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.796
Ogilvy wrote a book. l got the galleys.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.383
They want a quote or something.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.011
Advertising's already up there with lawyers
as the most reviled.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.138
This is not going to help.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.099
lt'll help him.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.727
lt's called Confessions ofan Ad Man.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.729
-l like the title.
-Please.

03:49.813 --> 03:52.148
lt's a book everybody writes,
only he got it published.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.483
lt should be called
1,000 Reasons I'm So Great.

03:54.610 --> 03:57.069
-ls he publishing it himself?
-No, Atheneum.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.614
l'll send it over. l don't want you to buy it.

03:59.698 --> 04:03.409
l don't know where to put it, and you know
l wouldn't be able to tell you if...

04:03.493 --> 04:04.619
There you are.

04:04.703 --> 04:05.828
When do you want us
to move the meeting to?

04:05.913 --> 04:08.748
-Mr. Draper?
-Move it? l'm 1 5 minutes late.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.750
l told you l don't want them hovering.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.627
lf l'm late, send them away
and call them when l get here.

04:12.711 --> 04:15.671
Mr. Draper, Conrad Hilton is in your office.

04:16.465 --> 04:18.591
-Right now?
-He just walked right in.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.053
-We were waiting and he blew right past us.
-Hold on.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.971
Come back in 20 minutes.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.849
-Did you offer him coffee?
-l did. He's all set.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.809
You look great.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.770
-Twenty minutes.
-You can take an hour if you need it.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.189
-He wants to look busy.
-Move it.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.529
Allison, hold all my calls.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.825
Connie. What a great way to start the day.

04:45.702 --> 04:50.247
-9:30? lt's practically lunch.
-Well, can l get you something?

04:51.541 --> 04:55.378
l've got a personal matter.
lt's not fit for the phone.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.972
What can l do for you?

05:06.056 --> 05:10.643
l don't know what l'm more disturbed by,
the fact that you don't have a Bible,

05:10.727 --> 05:13.312
or that there's not a single family photo.

05:13.397 --> 05:16.732
-l'm easily distracted.
-You should have those things.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.944
They'll make you feel better
about what you do.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.988
Start showing up on time.

05:22.072 --> 05:26.701
Maybe l'm late because l was spending time
with my family reading the Bible.

05:28.078 --> 05:31.539
Are you nervous, Don?
l'm finding you hard to talk to.

05:32.582 --> 05:36.502
Well, you caught me by surprise, Connie.
l think you know that.

05:42.259 --> 05:46.595
Now, you're a married man,
so you'll have to use your imagination,

05:47.472 --> 05:48.639
but

05:49.558 --> 05:52.810
l have this involvement.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.648
l can't say it's perfect,
and my needs are being met,

05:57.941 --> 06:00.359
but l have significant needs, Don.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.947
-Do you catch my drift?
-Yes.

06:06.616 --> 06:10.036
So what do l do
when my eye starts to wander?

06:12.497 --> 06:17.918
Don't you have a coterie of trusted advisors,
friends, kings,

06:18.003 --> 06:20.296
that might counsel you better?

06:22.299 --> 06:26.844
l want you to handle the Waldorf-Astoria,
the New York Hilton and the Statler Hilton.

06:27.471 --> 06:31.515
lt's just New York,
but my eye has definitely started to wander.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.812
l think that's a good start.

06:38.190 --> 06:43.402
Retainer, etcetera, that's for lawyers.
Everything else will be like this.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.995
Having me in your life
is gonna change things.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.998
-l look forward to it.
-They always say that.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.712
-A happy bunch.
-lf you say so.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.673
Young people give us energy.
Don't forget that.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.675
l'll take it from here.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.053
lt's not much to start with,

07:09.137 --> 07:11.806
but l look forward
to sharing my dreams with you.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.557
Speak to you soon.

07:25.529 --> 07:29.490
l cannot believe you just had a baby
and you redid your house.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.200
Are you suicidal?

07:31.910 --> 07:34.286
They were not
supposed to be simultaneous,

07:34.371 --> 07:37.998
and the baby wasn't the one
that couldn't keep a schedule.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.959
l'm assuming this meeting
means you're interested

07:40.043 --> 07:42.419
in replacing Francine as secretary?

07:42.504 --> 07:43.921
-l am.
-Good.

07:44.005 --> 07:47.508
Because we waited for you
for our most pressing business.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.094
The proposed 3-million-gallon water tank

07:50.178 --> 07:52.555
will not only drain
the Pleasantville Road Reservoir,

07:52.639 --> 07:56.433
but also blemish the natural
and financial health of our community.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.060
Well said.

07:58.145 --> 08:02.565
The Junior League needs to take over
this effort and explain the issues.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.360
Now, first, conservation. The Silent Spring?

08:07.571 --> 08:10.656
The majestic beauty
of the Hudson River valley.

08:11.199 --> 08:14.869
Second, worthless real estate
on both sides of the river

08:14.953 --> 08:18.747
because some industrial park
on Route 9 needs our water.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.292
We need to go over
the Village Board's head,

08:21.376 --> 08:25.171
appeal to the governor.
The Rockefellers own half the land here.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.464
Real estate, that's scary.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.637
l may know someone
in the governor's office.

08:34.306 --> 08:35.389
Who?

08:36.892 --> 08:38.684
His name is Henry.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.353
You're gonna have to do better than that.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.938
Henry Francis.

08:43.356 --> 08:47.067
He's in the paper sometimes,
always right behind Rocky.

08:47.152 --> 08:50.487
-What does he do?
-l'm not really sure.

08:51.531 --> 08:55.034
-How do you know him?
-l met him at a party for Don's work.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.621
Here he is. Oh, my, it just says "Advisor."

08:59.289 --> 09:02.458
Yes, l know who he is.

09:03.293 --> 09:07.254
He used to be the Republican Party chair
for Westchester County.

09:07.923 --> 09:11.258
-l know him.
-Well, call him, then.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.137
l think we have a better chance
if Betty calls.

09:16.932 --> 09:20.351
lt's not adorable to pretend
like you're not adorable.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.813
Call him. He's a big deal.

09:27.984 --> 09:31.070
Miami is where we should start,
let it grow from there.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.529
Ho-Ho wants it everywhere.

09:32.614 --> 09:35.658
He just bought land in Seattle.
lt's an indoor city.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.244
As long as he keeps writing checks.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.037
Look, do you want to
kill this thing in one blow

09:40.121 --> 09:42.289
or do you want to
shear the sheep every year?

09:42.374 --> 09:44.291
Whatever you want, Don.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.713
You made it clear
you don't want to talk about it,

09:49.798 --> 09:52.466
but at least tell us how you know him.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.552
We ran into each other at a party.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.556
That'll be all.

10:06.481 --> 10:11.193
l know Roger will be the face of this thing,
but l wouldn't mind doing the legwork.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.070
Pete, l think you're supposed to
bring in the account,

10:13.154 --> 10:15.698
and l'm supposed to beg to be on it.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.617
What happened
with North American Aviation?

10:18.702 --> 10:19.827
lt's going well.

10:19.911 --> 10:22.871
My friend Russ,
who deals with McNamara's office

10:22.956 --> 10:24.331
said the orders are through the roof

10:24.416 --> 10:27.960
for helicopters, carbines
and especially jets for Vietnam.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.462
l think l've convinced North American
they're going to need to spend more

10:30.547 --> 10:32.965
if they want to get out of NASA
and into the Pentagon.

10:34.259 --> 10:37.011
When they do, we can talk about Hilton.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.972
Understood.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.728
Oh, no. Yes, of course.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.688
He's busy.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.566
lt's Wilson 4-8038.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.778
Betty Draper. He can call me anytime.

10:55.572 --> 10:59.491
lt's a civic matter regarding Ossining.
Thank you.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.452
Lunch!

11:05.832 --> 11:07.750
Wash your hands, Bobby.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.339
Draper residence.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.008
Mrs. Draper, it's Henry Francis.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.344
Yes, of course.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.472
l appreciate
you getting back to me so quickly.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.848
Stop it.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.602
Could you hold just a moment?
l'm going to get on the extension.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.978
Of course.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.898
l'm going in the study. Hang up the phone.

11:39.783 --> 11:40.991
Damn it!

11:42.327 --> 11:45.204
-What is wrong with you?
-You said to hang up the phone.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.289
After l pick up the phone.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.166
Freeze.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.588
Draper residence.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.132
lt's Henry again. We were disconnected.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.426
l'm sorry about that. My son.

12:00.929 --> 12:05.182
l know how that goes. How are you?
You must have had your baby by now.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.811
Yes, l did. You remembered.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.772
-What did you have?
-A little boy.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.858
Can you get him registered by November?

12:15.944 --> 12:18.737
l just realized, everyone who calls you
must want something.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.073
Actually, l've been doing
most of the calling lately.

12:21.157 --> 12:25.160
-What can l do for you?
-Well, we were hoping

12:25.245 --> 12:28.414
you could stop the destruction
of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.417
-Who's we?
-I'm representing the Junior League

12:31.501 --> 12:33.001
of Tarrytown.

12:33.837 --> 12:37.965
They want to build a 3-million-gallon
water tank, and it's a very scenic area.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.258
I know the area.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.094
Well, it's practically
the governor's backyard.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.388
That's true, but l grew up there as well.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.682
-Really? Where?
-Mount Salem.

12:48.309 --> 12:53.021
l'm heading upstate tomorrow afternoon.
Maybe l could stop by and take a look.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.858
Well, tomorrow is Saturday.

12:56.067 --> 12:59.862
No, of course. l work every day,
l forget other people don't.

12:59.946 --> 13:00.988
No.

13:02.740 --> 13:06.493
This is very important to me.
l think l could find the time.

13:07.287 --> 13:11.707
-ls Swenson's Bakery still there?
-lt is. And it has an air conditioner.

13:12.167 --> 13:15.377
l'll buy you a cup of coffee, and then
we can take a hike to the reservoir.

13:15.462 --> 13:19.423
-Is 3:00 too late for you?
-No, it's perfect. l'll make it work.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.551
Well, I'll see you then, Mrs. Draper.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.861
l can save you the trouble.
lt's from him and it's expensive.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.821
l'm going to fire her.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.240
-What did you promise him?
-Who?

13:45.783 --> 13:49.369
You're thick, do you know that?
That present, it's from Duck.

13:49.454 --> 13:53.290
-Hermès. Nice.
-l hope yours is a different color.

13:54.334 --> 13:58.170
"Elegance and success. Duck."
l wonder who wrote that for him.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.631
-l don't trust him.
-Why?

14:01.466 --> 14:03.592
Because he wants us?

14:03.676 --> 14:06.178
-We're very important here.
-Who is?

14:07.805 --> 14:11.350
-Did he put you on Hilton?
-l don't know what you're talking about.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.978
Stop barging in here
and infecting me with your anxiety.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.190
This is really beautiful.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.026
He sent me a box of Cuban cigars.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.403
Although l'm starting to think
they're not that hard to come by.

14:23.488 --> 14:27.115
-Hilton Hotels? Did we get that?
-Do you live in a cave?

14:27.951 --> 14:29.701
Conrad Hilton
came to see Don this morning.

14:29.786 --> 14:33.121
-He was right there.
-Really? What was he like?

14:33.498 --> 14:37.334
l only got a quick look at him.
He was skinny, like a cowboy.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.837
My mother gave me his book. He's Catholic.

14:42.131 --> 14:45.634
-lt's going to be a huge account.
-Not as big as Lucky Strike.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.803
But it would be nice to be playing
a little offense for once

14:47.887 --> 14:50.472
instead of hiding from the FTC.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.058
-He has a book?
-l really like this.

14:54.936 --> 14:59.147
Look, l'm keeping this.
Duck said we're not tied together.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.985
l'll keep my mouth shut
and you do whatever you want.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.613
Do you know why
Duck doesn't work here anymore?

15:06.698 --> 15:09.616
Because Don squeezed him out
when the British took over.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.910
So what? Don didn't like him.

15:12.453 --> 15:15.539
lt's the world against Don,
and now it's someone else.

15:15.623 --> 15:19.543
True, but Duck
would love to hit Don where it hurts.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.422
Well, l'm not going anywhere,
and l'm not going to tell Don.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.717
l'm not worried about you.
l'm worried about Duck.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.385
Send it back.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.855
When were you going to tell us about this?

15:41.441 --> 15:44.026
l thought l'd let it be
an incoming phone call,

15:44.110 --> 15:47.029
and then wait and see who took credit for it.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.365
This is very exciting.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.660
Despite its modest billings,

15:53.786 --> 15:57.956
London is thrilled with Hilton's potential
for international growth.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.667
Finally.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.544
Huzzah!

16:04.213 --> 16:07.799
lf you don't mind my asking,
how did you make this happen?

16:07.884 --> 16:10.093
We travel in the same circles.

16:10.178 --> 16:13.513
Well, l don't know
if we should celebrate yet.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.976
His lawyers called,
and there's a little matter of the contract.

16:18.061 --> 16:21.938
Well, don't be afraid to push back.
l agreed to the New York hotels,

16:22.023 --> 16:25.067
but everything else
should be under our terms.

16:25.652 --> 16:29.738
l don't think you understand.
This is regarding your contract.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.573
Or lack thereof.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.202
lt may seem like a formality to you,

16:35.286 --> 16:40.415
but to Mr. Hilton it's a necessity that
all the principals in the firm be secured.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.169
And honestly, l can't blame him.

16:46.214 --> 16:51.176
-l'll give him my word.
-And he'll take it, but his lawyers won't.

17:00.937 --> 17:04.690
Obviously, you'll want
your attorney to look it over.

17:04.774 --> 17:08.110
That's Ben Michelson. lt's fairly standard.

17:09.112 --> 17:12.572
Three years, a non-compete clause,
a healthy raise.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.079
That's very generous. l'll think about it.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.165
l'm confused.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.670
lf someone handed me that contract,
l'd be filled with glee.

17:26.754 --> 17:30.924
A three-year guarantee,
a $5,000 signing bonus? l...

17:31.801 --> 17:36.138
-l've never seen that before.
-Well, we want to take care of him.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.893
Look, l've gotten to know
Conrad Hilton a little bit.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.063
And l think he'll enjoy
something he can't have,

17:46.691 --> 17:49.109
and you should tell him
that it matters to me.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.861
lt matters to him.

17:51.529 --> 17:55.240
Still, l don't think anyone told him
that it matters to me.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.662
Well, this is the way it has to be.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.416
And not just for Conrad Hilton,
but for Sterling Cooper.

18:05.501 --> 18:10.088
l'd like you to take those papers home
for the weekend and think about that.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.015
l'd be happy to.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.649
l met him once.
He's a bit of an eccentric, isn't he?

18:34.322 --> 18:35.363
Yes.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.046
Oh, Jesus.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.947
-Mrs. Draper.
-Mr. Francis.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.324
l'm alone. l hope that's okay.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.869
Oh, well. Actually,
my friend couldn't get away either.

19:26.207 --> 19:29.584
-l appreciate your coming up.
-Please. l love coming back here.

19:29.669 --> 19:34.172
-So much changes, so much doesn't.
-Like what? l'm interested.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.466
Can l help you?

19:36.551 --> 19:39.594
-Just an iced tea, please.
-That's fine for now.

19:46.602 --> 19:50.438
-What was l saying?
-You were talking about coming back here.

19:51.107 --> 19:54.109
Ossining has always been
a real mix of people.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.695
Well, after living in Manhattan,
it wasn't my first choice,

19:56.779 --> 19:58.572
but it's grown on me.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.867
l lived in Manhattan when l was married.

20:01.951 --> 20:06.079
lt's okay for work, but l can't sleep
with all those people on top of me.

20:06.163 --> 20:10.125
Like in a skyscraper. May l have a straw?

20:13.296 --> 20:15.297
So, you have your folder.

20:16.632 --> 20:20.468
l thought l'd just give you the literature
and a copy of the petition.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.305
l don't know that l'm a great spokesman.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.932
You don't have to tell me
how beautiful the reservoir is.

20:26.017 --> 20:29.477
-l used to do jackknives into it.
-We drink that water.

20:31.689 --> 20:35.567
l've looked into this for you,
and l'm afraid it's underway.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.029
Oh, no. We're too late.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.033
Maybe if you knew somebody
with some clout.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.913
l don't even know what you do.

20:48.247 --> 20:52.042
l'm a classic strategist, fundraiser,
maybe campaign manager.

20:52.168 --> 20:55.337
-l'm waiting on that.
-And how do you become that?

20:56.464 --> 20:58.590
-Give a lot of money?
-No.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.509
No, l'm a lawyer, but l don't use it much.

21:02.428 --> 21:07.682
We all have skills we don't use.
l was an anthropology major. lmagine that.

21:08.851 --> 21:12.062
-Where?
-Bryn Mawr.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.691
Well, you may be
saving your community right now.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.694
l'm hungry. Do you mind?

21:20.571 --> 21:22.614
-l don't know.
-Fine.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.784
You can read from your folder
and watch me eat.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.662
l'll have apple pie and...

21:29.413 --> 21:31.539
lce cream or cheddar cheese?

21:32.583 --> 21:34.000
One of each.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.838
Can we just get one thing out of the way?

21:41.717 --> 21:44.844
l don't know what l can do
about the water tank.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.477
Don't give up so easily.

21:54.772 --> 21:58.149
What this really is, is a camera obscura.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.152
We call it a sun scope.

22:01.237 --> 22:05.365
And it allows us to look at the eclipse
without injury to our eyes.

22:06.033 --> 22:08.827
-We didn't bring a scissor.
-l have scissors.

22:08.911 --> 22:12.580
And squares of cardboard
that already have pinholes in them.

22:12.665 --> 22:16.668
And if you really need some help,
ask your dads.

22:17.336 --> 22:21.840
The eclipse is 22 minutes away.
Gentlemen, start your engines.

22:23.551 --> 22:26.928
l could have gone golfing.
l had no idea this is what we'd be in for.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.305
Go ahead. l'll take Ernie home.

22:30.391 --> 22:33.852
You know, Francine taught school
when we were first married.

22:33.936 --> 22:37.397
l used to love seeing her
standing in the middle of those little kids

22:37.481 --> 22:40.650
like a telephone pole. Hey.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.154
There you go.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.741
Sally has a crush on her.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.203
Why can't you stare into the eclipse?

22:52.288 --> 22:55.957
What's it going to do, really?
l stare at the sun every day.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.836
-You stare at the sun every day?
-Well, you know, look at it.

23:01.797 --> 23:05.508
You know, l see her sometimes
when l'm out running in the morning.

23:05.593 --> 23:08.636
-You run?
-Yeah, over by the high school track.

23:09.305 --> 23:12.057
-Do you talk?
-No. No, there's an etiquette to it.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.141
You keep to yourself.

23:13.225 --> 23:17.812
And honestly, that's one of the things
l love about my run, is being alone.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.482
That's hard to come by, you know?

23:25.821 --> 23:30.116
Listen, l hate to disappoint you,
but l have to be on my way.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.497
-That's too bad.
-l have to be in Albany for dinner.

23:35.581 --> 23:36.790
His master's voice.

23:37.833 --> 23:38.833
The governor.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.672
"His master's voice"? lt's an old ad.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.343
l know what it is.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.772
-What are you doing?
-lt's the eclipse.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.690
He made a contraption.

24:05.319 --> 24:06.945
Don't look at it.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.078
Are you okay?

24:16.080 --> 24:18.498
l think so. l feel a little dizzy.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.251
Take a deep breath.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.548
ls that better?

24:30.761 --> 24:33.429
So you never had time
to go to the reservoir anyway.

24:33.514 --> 24:36.391
l only had an hour, but l figured...

24:36.475 --> 24:39.102
That's what you need. A fainting couch.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.396
What's that?

24:42.148 --> 24:46.067
Victorian ladies would get overwhelmed
from corsets and things.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.945
They'd need a place to lie down.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.365
-How do you know that?
-l used to move furniture.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.995
May l walk you to your car?

24:58.581 --> 25:03.168
-l don't know. This is still a small town.
-No, of course.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.296
-Mrs. Draper.
-Betty.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.547
Henry.

25:08.257 --> 25:13.136
So, that's a rain check for the hike.
l'll contact you as soon as l know anything.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.063
You doing okay?

25:31.363 --> 25:35.617
-You don't want to watch it?
-l will once it gets a little further along.

25:35.701 --> 25:40.205
l don't know if you heard me before,
but it only happens once every 1 0 years.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.290
You don't want to miss it.

25:43.584 --> 25:46.377
-How's your summer going?
-lt's good.

25:46.462 --> 25:50.924
-Are you gonna take a vacation?
-l don't think so. l'll get August off,

25:51.008 --> 25:54.636
then September l'm back at it.
lt's all fairly prescribed.

25:56.055 --> 25:59.140
Have you been here in August?
lt's a ghost town.

25:59.516 --> 26:02.644
-Where are you going?
-We'll be here.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.814
So now l know that.

26:07.316 --> 26:11.027
Most just come right out
and ask if l'm going to be around.

26:12.488 --> 26:15.949
l was just making conversation.
You can change it if you want to.

26:16.033 --> 26:19.327
You're all the same.
The drinking, the philandering.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.587
They don't know that word.

26:30.464 --> 26:33.508
Do you want me to leave you alone?
Just say so.

26:34.760 --> 26:40.181
-lt's hard because this happens a lot.
-Nothing is happening. We're just talking.

26:42.977 --> 26:44.060
Okay.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.106
And where l come from,
schoolteachers, especially, used to say

26:48.190 --> 26:50.692
you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

26:50.776 --> 26:54.320
-So you're different, huh?
-ls that impossible?

26:55.698 --> 26:58.157
You're all wearing the same shirt.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.834
So how do people live elsewhere?

27:09.753 --> 27:13.006
They don't have as much.
They don't get as bored.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.510
l'm not bored.

27:20.180 --> 27:23.725
Miss Farrell. Miss Farrell. l can see it. Look!

27:28.731 --> 27:31.065
Let me see it with you. Show me.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.887
Yes, is he in?

28:03.015 --> 28:05.933
Tell him it's Peggy Olson regarding Clorox.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.436
Of course.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.027
Hello.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.738
Miss Olson, what a pleasant surprise.

28:18.822 --> 28:23.076
l haven't changed my mind,
and l'd appreciate you not sending things.

28:23.369 --> 28:26.454
-Things you want to keep?
-l'm sending it back.

28:26.789 --> 28:29.123
And l hope you take that
as a definitive answer.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.250
l would if you already sent it.

28:31.335 --> 28:35.213
Listen. l've been having meetings
at The Pierre all day, suite 600.

28:35.297 --> 28:38.466
At 4:30, Hermès comes by.
Give it back in person.

28:39.093 --> 28:41.969
-Why are you meeting at The Pierre?
-Have you been to Grey?

28:42.054 --> 28:45.139
lt's a Penn Station toilet
with Venetian blinds.

28:46.809 --> 28:47.809
l can't do that.

28:47.893 --> 28:50.561
You can and you will,
then I'll leave you alone.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.564
Suite 600 at 4:30, not the other way around.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.235
Please don't contact me again.

29:06.495 --> 29:09.497
-How was your weekend?
-Short.

29:11.750 --> 29:16.212
-What did Michelson think of the contract?
-He hasn't gotten back to me.

29:16.880 --> 29:21.008
That's because he didn't get it. l called him.

29:21.802 --> 29:26.097
Are you afraid you're going to have a boss?
You will, the client.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.934
-lt's not that.
-What is the problem?

29:30.519 --> 29:32.186
You think you're more dangerous
without a contract?

29:32.271 --> 29:35.106
You are, and it's affecting our business.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.357
You're our David Ogilvy,

29:36.442 --> 29:40.194
and if you let all the blokes at Putnam,
Powell & Lowe relax for three years,

29:40.279 --> 29:45.366
maybe we could put your name out front.
After mine. And Cooper, probably.

29:49.204 --> 29:53.833
Well, l'll let you get back to work.
All l need is a letter of intent.

29:55.836 --> 30:00.798
Ben Michelson can rape us later.
Grunt once for "yes."

30:08.432 --> 30:10.725
The problem is, l don't know
if you don't want to do this here

30:10.809 --> 30:13.311
or you don't want to do this at all.

30:15.898 --> 30:18.065
Didn't we give you an office?

30:19.818 --> 30:23.279
l just need a minute.
l need to send Martinson's to the printer.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.739
Come on in.

30:33.207 --> 30:36.417
So, do you know
who you're gonna put on Hilton yet?

30:38.045 --> 30:39.045
No.

30:39.129 --> 30:40.963
Well, l don't know
if they want a woman's point of view,

30:41.048 --> 30:43.174
-but l read his book, and...
-Who told you

30:43.258 --> 30:45.927
we were going to land Hilton?
Because we're not.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.721
And l resent you bringing work
in here under pretense.

30:48.805 --> 30:51.807
-l didn't.
-l didn't need to sign off on this.

30:52.267 --> 30:55.478
l'm sorry if... l was excited.

30:56.271 --> 30:57.939
And l heard there was
an amazing assignment.

30:58.023 --> 31:01.692
And you thought you'd come in here
and ask for it because l never say no.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.611
You say no all the time.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.614
What do l have to do for you?
Peggy, tell me.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.243
You were my secretary,

31:10.327 --> 31:15.206
and now you have an office and a job
that a lot of full-grown men would kill for.

31:15.916 --> 31:18.334
Every time l turn around,
you've got your hand in my pocket.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.962
You want a raise. You want this account.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.422
Put your nose down
and pay attention to your work,

31:23.507 --> 31:25.550
because there's not one thing
that you've done here

31:25.634 --> 31:27.843
that l couldn't live without.

31:31.974 --> 31:33.849
l'm sorry, Don.

31:34.643 --> 31:38.813
You're good. Get better.
Stop asking for things.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.902
Close the door.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.826
Draper residence.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.412
Betty. Roger Sterling. How are you?

31:55.205 --> 31:57.707
-l'm well, thank you.
-Is Don about?

31:58.458 --> 32:00.626
No, he's not home yet. Shall l leave word?

32:00.711 --> 32:04.088
Actually, Betty, if l could be frank,
it's important.

32:04.673 --> 32:07.216
-What's wrong?
-Well, it's a little touchy.

32:07.301 --> 32:10.303
l don't want to put you
in a strange position.

32:13.348 --> 32:16.684
-What's wrong, Roger?
-Well, it's about his contract.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.061
What about it?

32:19.146 --> 32:20.938
Look, l know you have to be
on the same page as him,

32:21.023 --> 32:24.650
and he's your husband.
But it's a lot of money, Betty.

32:28.196 --> 32:32.992
-Three years isn't that long, you know.
-l'm sorry. What do you want?

32:33.869 --> 32:37.121
l want you to see what you can do
to get him to sign it.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.373
l know you're the woman behind the man.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.168
Don is going to do
whatever he's going to do.

32:42.252 --> 32:46.464
And honestly, l find it terribly disrespectful
that you would go behind his back.

32:46.548 --> 32:49.342
-Easy, Betty, that's not...
-l have to go.

32:52.554 --> 32:56.265
You missed Hermès.
l was going to give you 1 0 more minutes.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.730
You came all this way, have a drink.

33:09.112 --> 33:12.406
-What are you having?
-Whatever you're having.

33:13.075 --> 33:15.618
-l'm not having anything.
-A whiskey.

33:17.704 --> 33:21.332
-You are Don's girl, aren't you?
-l was raised on whiskey.

33:23.627 --> 33:25.002
Sit down.

33:25.087 --> 33:28.631
A few minutes of adult conversation,
and we both go home.

33:35.097 --> 33:37.848
Grey has Hermès, Macy's,

33:37.933 --> 33:40.267
H.J. Heinz baby food and Revlon.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.854
-You need someone in a skirt.
-Everybody does.

33:45.232 --> 33:46.607
Copy chief?

33:47.359 --> 33:51.070
Maybe once they get used to you,
but definitely more money.

33:51.279 --> 33:55.074
-Would l get to go to Paris for Hermès?
-They come here,

33:56.243 --> 33:59.120
but you're not going anywhere
where you are.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.960
-l can't.
-Okay.

34:07.045 --> 34:10.423
Just so you know,
that's what opportunity looks like.

34:15.512 --> 34:18.597
l'm just sorry
l won't be seeing you every day.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.977
What are you doing?

34:23.729 --> 34:28.482
l was just thinking about all the times
l've walked by you and didn't even notice.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.654
How is that possible?

34:44.875 --> 34:46.876
What do you want from me?

34:48.378 --> 34:51.589
l want to take you in that bedroom,
lock the door,

34:51.757 --> 34:55.301
take your clothes off with my teeth,
throw you on the bed

34:55.385 --> 34:58.471
and give you a go-around
like you've never had.

35:16.990 --> 35:19.992
Bobby, Sally, turn off the TV
and go upstairs.

35:24.915 --> 35:28.584
-What's wrong?
-Roger Sterling called.

35:29.961 --> 35:34.423
He pretended to be calling for you, and then
he started on me about your contract.

35:34.508 --> 35:37.468
-What?
-Your contract, Don.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.805
lt was very uncomfortable.

35:44.768 --> 35:46.977
-What are you doing?
-What do you think?

35:47.062 --> 35:48.979
-l'm calling him.
-Don't.

35:49.064 --> 35:51.398
Betts, don't worry about my job.

35:51.608 --> 35:54.527
Why would l?
l don't know anything about it.

35:54.778 --> 35:57.905
They offered you a contract
and you didn't say a damn thing to me.

35:57.989 --> 36:02.159
l had to hear about it from him.
And why the hell won't you sign it?

36:04.913 --> 36:08.165
lt doesn't concern you. You're taken care of.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.084
Why won't you sign it?

36:10.418 --> 36:12.169
Let me explain something to you
about business,

36:12.254 --> 36:15.923
since, as usual, you're turning this
into something about yourself.

36:16.007 --> 36:20.886
No contract means l have all the power.
They want me, but they can't have me.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.514
You're right.

36:23.598 --> 36:26.809
Why would l think
that has anything to do with me?

36:28.937 --> 36:30.813
lt's three years, Don.

36:31.648 --> 36:36.151
What's the matter? You don't know
where you're going to be in three years?

36:40.991 --> 36:42.366
Good night.

37:05.473 --> 37:08.309
l love the taste of liquor on your breath.

37:23.408 --> 37:25.451
-Where you headed?
-Niagara Falls.

37:25.535 --> 37:28.287
But we'll settle for the nearest motel.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.872
Hop in.

37:40.342 --> 37:41.675
Thank you.

37:44.346 --> 37:47.348
-l'm Doug. This is Sandy.
-Nice to meet you.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.352
-How far are we?
-A couple of miles.

37:53.813 --> 37:56.899
You wanna know
why we're going to Niagara Falls?

37:57.400 --> 38:01.195
-We're getting married.
-At Niagara Falls. Fancy that.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.991
-People keep trying to talk us out of it.
-Why's that?

38:06.868 --> 38:09.745
Well, we don't really
know each other that well.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.456
Well, we knew each other
a little bit in high school,

38:12.540 --> 38:15.376
and we're not really in love or anything.

38:15.710 --> 38:19.380
l'm sure you have a good reason,
not that it's any of my business.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.881
l'm not knocked up.

38:20.966 --> 38:25.094
They're passing a law that if you're married,
they can't send you to Vietnam.

38:25.178 --> 38:29.223
l don't know if you've served, mister.
l don't want to offend you.

38:29.891 --> 38:32.017
Again, none of my business.

38:32.102 --> 38:36.355
lt's just l'm 1 -A. l'm 22.
l can't get into school.

38:36.898 --> 38:40.067
l kind of have a target on my back,
and for what?

38:40.485 --> 38:43.696
l think they're really
gonna start sending people.

38:44.030 --> 38:47.074
l have it on good authority that you're right.

38:47.242 --> 38:50.369
Good authority? Are you a spook?

38:54.749 --> 38:57.543
Nope. l'm in advertising.

38:59.921 --> 39:02.589
No way. Now that's priceless.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.593
-But you seem okay.
-Thank you.

39:09.889 --> 39:13.934
lt's a beautiful night. lt smells good.

39:15.729 --> 39:18.605
But everything smells good
when you're high.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.695
That's true.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.158
Listen, Cadillac,

39:31.411 --> 39:33.704
we don't have gas money, but...

39:36.249 --> 39:37.499
Yeah.

39:37.584 --> 39:40.836
-They're reds. You ever had them?
-What are they?

39:42.088 --> 39:44.381
Phenobarbital. They're my dad's.

39:46.593 --> 39:49.386
Give me one. Make it two.

40:16.873 --> 40:20.250
-Does he know how to dance?
-Who cares?

40:27.008 --> 40:29.468
-How old are you?
-Nineteen.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.054
How old are you?

40:38.311 --> 40:42.272
-Why can't you go to school?
-Because it's a waste of time, man.

40:43.525 --> 40:47.111
-You like to watch us dance?
-Yeah, you want to watch us?

41:01.334 --> 41:04.711
A hillbilly knocks on the door
of his new neighbor's house.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.964
"Howdy, neighbor," he says.

41:07.048 --> 41:10.801
"ln honor of you moving into the holler,
l'm gonna throw a party.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.845
"There's gonna be a whole lot of drinking,

41:12.929 --> 41:16.306
"a whole lot of dancing
and a whole lot of screwing."

41:17.892 --> 41:21.478
"Sounds like fun," the neighbor says.
"What can l bring?"

41:22.063 --> 41:25.732
The hillbilly replies,
"You can bring anything you want.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.152
"lt's just gonna be you and me."

41:34.492 --> 41:36.994
What are you laughing at, Cadillac?

41:45.503 --> 41:48.881
Look at you. Up to your old tricks.

41:50.049 --> 41:52.217
You're a bum, you know that?

41:53.052 --> 41:56.054
-No, l'm not.
-Conrad Hilton?

41:57.223 --> 41:59.725
You wouldn't expect him
to be taken so easily.

41:59.809 --> 42:03.103
-Shut up.
-You can't be tied down.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.190
-That's right.
-Look at your hands.

42:06.816 --> 42:09.026
They're as soft as a woman's.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.197
What do you do? What do you make?

42:15.408 --> 42:17.075
You grow bullshit.

42:36.930 --> 42:40.140
-l gave him two.
-How the hell is he still awake?

43:19.389 --> 43:21.098
Everything okay?

43:21.182 --> 43:23.809
l'm worried that housekeeping
is going to come in.

43:23.893 --> 43:27.271
l put out the sign.
l'll call them when we're done.

43:29.274 --> 43:33.527
-l don't know.
-Come on. l love the morning.

43:41.828 --> 43:44.246
What were you thinking? lt's awful.

43:45.540 --> 43:47.833
-lt's an antique.
-We discussed this for months,

43:47.917 --> 43:50.544
and we decided antiques were expected.

43:51.212 --> 43:54.089
Look around!
You have ruined the whole room.

43:55.717 --> 43:59.761
lf you want to keep it,
please do not tell people l did this.

44:08.062 --> 44:10.272
-Good morning.
-Fender bender.

44:12.734 --> 44:14.901
l'm going to get coffee. Do you want some?

44:14.986 --> 44:16.486
No, thank you.

44:21.075 --> 44:23.160
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

44:23.244 --> 44:26.788
-Fender bender.
-l'm sorry. Mr. Cooper's waiting for you.

44:27.582 --> 44:28.915
Thank you.

44:31.461 --> 44:34.796
-Good morning.
-Sit down.

44:38.718 --> 44:40.344
What do you want?

44:40.928 --> 44:45.557
Sacajawea carried a baby on her back
all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

44:47.185 --> 44:50.854
And somewhere,
that baby thinks he discovered America.

44:52.940 --> 44:56.234
You, Don, have been standing
on someone's shoulders.

44:56.527 --> 44:59.613
We brought you in,
we nurtured you like family,

45:00.198 --> 45:02.616
and now's the time to pay us back.

45:04.827 --> 45:07.662
You can't go any further on your own, Don.

45:16.297 --> 45:19.299
Would you say
l know something about you, Don?

45:23.638 --> 45:24.888
l would.

45:32.688 --> 45:34.022
Then sign.

45:38.611 --> 45:43.448
After all, when it comes down to it,
who is really signing this contract anyway?

46:02.260 --> 46:05.470
l don't want any more contact
with Roger Sterling.

46:18.568 --> 46:19.651
Don?

46:23.698 --> 46:25.115
l signed it.
