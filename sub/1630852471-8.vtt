Our hero this week,
his name is Chris Baker.

"He is 36 years old,
and he lives here in Austin, Texas."

The sense of community, the sense
of belonging, the sense of dignity

01:01.686 --> 01:03.104
is really where the magic happens.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.231
I am the founder and executive director

01:05.315 --> 01:08.443
of a homelessness service nonprofit
called the Other Ones Foundation.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.570
We believe that housing is a human right.

01:10.653 --> 01:11.905
How's the showers going?

01:11.988 --> 01:16.242
This was broken before,
but we actually fixed it up,

01:16.326 --> 01:18.453
and now water is flowing smoothly.

01:18.536 --> 01:21.873
We offer hygiene facilities
and food access

01:21.956 --> 01:23.708
to help give them a dignified existence

01:23.792 --> 01:26.169
as they sort of make that journey
out of homelessness.

01:26.252 --> 01:29.923
You know, to be able to help these people
get their dignity back is a huge thing.

01:30.006 --> 01:32.967
I cannot wait to meet Chris.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.094
This is awesome.

He is married to Elizabeth."

-[Tan] Cute.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.148
[Bobby] "And he was nominated by Liz,
Chris' wife."

01:47.232 --> 01:51.361
He is one of the most compassionate
and kind people that I know.

01:51.444 --> 01:56.533
At the same time, I don't think
he gives himself that same kindness.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.160
"Chris has been insecure
about his weight his entire life,

01:59.244 --> 02:01.955
and recently received
gastric bypass surgery."

02:02.038 --> 02:04.582
"But hasn't bought clothes
to match his new shrinking body."

02:04.666 --> 02:05.750
Okay.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.295
[Chris] It was just four months ago
that I was, like, almost 400 pounds.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.464
So, like, nothing I have really fits me.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.799
Hmm.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.968
[Bobby] "Chris spends
about 18 hours a day working."

02:15.051 --> 02:17.345
"He never dresses professionally
for meetings with investors

02:17.428 --> 02:20.140
and is self-conscious that
it prevents him from finding more funds

02:20.223 --> 02:21.850
to help the deprived community he serves."

02:21.933 --> 02:25.520
It's nothing that
a French tuck cannot fix.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.403
[Bobby] "Chris fears
nothing he does is ever enough."

02:33.486 --> 02:37.240
"His wife worries that if he doesn't take
better care of himself, he will burn out."

02:37.323 --> 02:40.535
[Liz] He cares so deeply
for the organization and the people

02:40.618 --> 02:42.787
that he really struggles
to peel himself away.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.873
[Karamo] What I think
is important for anybody

02:44.956 --> 02:47.417
who works
in any social services-type jobs,

02:47.500 --> 02:50.044
you have to remember that
there has to be a work-life balance,

02:50.128 --> 02:52.297
or you're gonna
start seeing yourself drifting away

02:52.380 --> 02:54.632
from things that you love outside of work.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.260
My mom, who died about
five years ago, said to me,

02:57.343 --> 03:00.096
"The only true measure
of a successful person

03:00.180 --> 03:02.807
is how they make
the people around them feel."

03:02.891 --> 03:05.185
That really became
really deeply ingrained in me.

03:05.268 --> 03:09.272
Chris' mom's passing
was extremely difficult.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.483
We had purchased the house,
and me, Chris and the kids had moved in,

03:12.567 --> 03:14.027
and then she came home

03:14.110 --> 03:17.155
and was here
for five days before she passed.

03:18.156 --> 03:22.911
That was a really difficult way
to start out our time here in this house,

03:22.994 --> 03:26.039
and I know that Chris
really didn't want to be here.

03:27.540 --> 03:31.211
At the end of the week,
Chris has a really big event going on.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.463
He is presenting
in front of a bunch of people

03:33.546 --> 03:36.799
to get donations to raise
$6 million for his organization.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.094
It'll be a big kickoff
with lots of people.

03:40.178 --> 03:43.014
And the goal right now is to get funding

03:43.097 --> 03:45.600
for the 200-unit
transitional shelter complex

03:45.683 --> 03:47.852
that we're building
at the Esperanza Community.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.813
But if we don't get the funding,
then everything falls apart.

03:51.522 --> 03:55.568
[Liz] I think Chris needs help now
more than any other time

03:55.652 --> 03:59.030
because there's all of this pressure
around this event.

03:59.113 --> 04:02.825
He needs to have that self-confidence
and feel good about himself.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.369
So, our mission this week, guys.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.286
-Yep.
-Yeah?

04:05.370 --> 04:07.330
"Let's help this unconfident

all persons are inherently valuable.

the man in front of it all,

the way everybody else thinks of him.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.194
-Okay.
-[Tan] It's a massive room. Beautiful.

09:30.278 --> 09:33.197
Bobby is stressed out about--
I feel it. It's fine, Bobby.

09:33.281 --> 09:37.076
Well, because red is a color
that actually causes anxiety and stress.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.953
-[imitates whirring, laughs]
-Stop.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.042
[Antoni] Oh, my gosh,
so many nutrition shakes.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.377
[camera shutter clicks]

09:48.379 --> 09:52.300
We're what my therapist refers to
as pathologically codependent.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.259
[boy] Smile.

09:53.342 --> 09:55.845
-Okay. So, what's this story?
-[camera shutter clicks]

09:55.928 --> 09:58.889
-Oh, that's from dyeing my hair.
-Ooh!

09:58.973 --> 10:00.308
We were adventurous, hunty.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.435
-[Chris] Yeah.
-Let's see what's going on.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.146
-Okay. So, there's the whispers.
-Yeah.

10:05.229 --> 10:08.316
Are we vibing the bleach and tone?
Do you like it?

10:08.399 --> 10:10.192
I'd like for it to go away, probably.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.612
Oh, your hair is quite salt-and-pepper.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.740
Okay. So, show me your stuff.
What happened?

10:15.823 --> 10:17.241
-[Tan] Can I intrude?
-[screams]

10:17.325 --> 10:19.869
-I will rip your top off you.
-I just--

10:19.952 --> 10:22.580
-[laughing]
-[Antoni] Thank you so much.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.290
Althea, would you like some ice cream?

10:24.373 --> 10:26.792
I'm surprisingly full, but I can't say no.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.962
I feel you. I understand you. I see you.

10:30.046 --> 10:33.841
So, how has it changed since
his procedure, like, having meals?

10:33.924 --> 10:37.803
What do you, like, typically-- I see,
like, there are smoothies on the counter.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.848
Is that, like,
a big part of his daily diet?

10:40.931 --> 10:45.394
Yeah, breakfast especially
has been the protein shakes.

10:45.478 --> 10:49.649
But he's really not eating with, I think,
like, the regularity that's recommended,

10:49.732 --> 10:51.942
which is, like, these teeny-tiny meals.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.277
-Which is tough.
-[Liz] Yeah.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.992
So, you have lost
a lot of weight recently.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.162
Are you feeling
more confident in your skin

11:03.245 --> 11:05.956
now you've gotten down to a closer weight
that you wanted to be at?

11:06.040 --> 11:09.460
Um, yeah, I mean, I think I still
have kind of a long way to go.

11:09.543 --> 11:13.172
Okay, so I would like to know,
what do you wanna look like?

11:14.590 --> 11:16.676
-I know that's a hard question to answer.
-Yeah.

11:16.759 --> 11:20.137
I wanna look like
a person who's capable…

11:20.971 --> 11:24.892
and able to do what I do.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.853
Because it's clear you already are
that person who's capable,

11:27.937 --> 11:30.022
'cause you are killing shit out there.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.857
-You're doing an incredible job.
-Yeah.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.026
But we're launching a fundraising campaign

11:34.110 --> 11:37.488
to build a very innovative
shelter complex.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.198
-Great.
-And let's just be honest.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.617
Some people are gonna
look at me and they're gonna be like,

11:41.701 --> 11:43.536
"Whatever organization that guy runs

11:43.619 --> 11:46.288
is not the organization
I'm gonna donate a million dollars to."

11:46.372 --> 11:48.833
So, like, how do we find that balance?

11:48.916 --> 11:52.795
-That's maybe something to think about.
-Yeah. Absolutely.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.089

There's some cabinet doors

12:10.813 --> 12:15.443
I like to think that
they're fundamentally the same.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.612
-Mm-hmm.
-But it's something that Liz brought up.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.532
I have this big, long list

12:21.615 --> 12:24.243
of important things that need
to be taken care of all the time.

12:24.326 --> 12:28.497
And I tend
to be the very last thing on that list.

12:28.581 --> 12:32.585
Yeah. So, this week, it's okay
for it just to be about you.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.257
[Chris] That's one of the nicest things
that anybody's ever said to me.

12:38.966 --> 12:41.177
-Thank you for that.
-You're welcome.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.972
So, how long have you been putting
yourself at the bottom of your list?

12:45.931 --> 12:49.977
[sighs] You know,
there's, like, a point in my history

12:50.060 --> 12:55.816
when I was experiencing, like,

12:55.900 --> 12:57.860
varying degrees of substance use disorder.

12:57.943 --> 13:01.363
-I've had that as a part of my past.
-Yeah.

13:01.447 --> 13:07.077
And we naturally, in that condition,
put ourselves before everything else.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.747
And so I deal with a lot of, like,
shame and regret from that,

13:09.830 --> 13:11.040
and that's very difficult.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.959
Like, just saying that is, like,
very hard for me to acknowledge that.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.086
Yeah, I appreciate that vulnerability.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.172
Substance abuse
does make you feel inherently

13:18.255 --> 13:20.049
like everything you're doing is selfish.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.843
But what I do also know
about, like, addiction is that

13:22.927 --> 13:25.262
it also helps you to escape.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.347
Sure.

13:26.972 --> 13:27.973
If you don't mind sharing,

13:28.057 --> 13:30.184
what were some of the things
you were trying to escape?

13:30.267 --> 13:33.312
[chuckles] I feel like I'm belaboring
this point every time I talk to somebody,

13:33.395 --> 13:39.235
but, like, this house was the product
of my mom being sick.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.696
And so we bought this house with
the plan of all of us living together.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.614
Yeah.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.575
But her cancer
metastasized into her brain.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.953
She went into the hospital,
and then that was it.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.789
The only time then she ever lived
in this house was under hospice care,

13:51.872 --> 13:55.334
and she was completely out of it.
And then the nurses come and they go,

13:55.417 --> 13:59.755
"Here's a half gallon bottle
of liquid morphine. Here you go."

13:59.839 --> 14:02.842
"Then you take this and crush the pills up
and then you pour the morphine in,

14:02.925 --> 14:06.345
and then you take that out
and you treat those symptoms…"

14:07.930 --> 14:10.766
"Death may be a side effect of that,
but you treat those symptoms."

14:11.684 --> 14:16.105
But there's always been this little voice
in my head calling me a murderer for it.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.859
-Yeah.
-So, I'm going through this process.

14:19.942 --> 14:24.238
As I'm doing it, all of these drugs
are getting into my system too.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.366
A little for me, a little for you.
A little for me, a little for you.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.244
And that morphine…

14:31.370 --> 14:33.205
the Ativan, the Xanax,

14:33.289 --> 14:36.792
that shit completely came
to completely ruin my life…

14:36.876 --> 14:37.710
Yeah.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.546
…for a good period of time
after that, man.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.423
So… [clears throat]

14:43.173 --> 14:45.384
-Where the guilt and shame come from.
-Yeah.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.594
Yeah, I understand.

14:46.677 --> 14:50.681
There's guilt and shame wrapped around it,
just like being a big, fat guy, like…

14:51.932 --> 14:53.475
-It just is.
-Yeah.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.311
So…

14:56.562 --> 14:57.438
There's that too.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.772
So, it makes sense to me.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.733
-Yeah.
-Like, thank you for sharing that.

15:00.816 --> 15:04.695
It helps me to understand where you are
in your life and what you've been through

15:04.778 --> 15:07.907
and also hearing that story
about the house that we're in now,

15:07.990 --> 15:10.701
a lot of that is attached to this house.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.578
So, every day you walk in this house,

15:12.661 --> 15:15.831
you feel and experience
all those things unconsciously.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.958
-Oh, yeah.
-Can I have a hug?

15:19.585 --> 15:21.712
-Oh. I appreciate you.
-Thanks, man.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.632
-[Karamo] We're gonna have fun.
-Thank you, again.

15:25.799 --> 15:28.510
-[Chris] I'm glad we're getting to meet.
-Yeah, me too.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.597
Chris, thank you so much
for spending time with us today.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.183
I think we've
all really found an opportunity

15:34.266 --> 15:36.518
to understand what it is
that we can help you with.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.687
-All right.
-[Bobby] I got a few projects.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.773
-[Tan] Shall we get on with our week?
-Yes.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.483
-Wonderful! All right!
-[laughing]

15:42.566 --> 15:44.693
Let's get out of here. Let's do this!

15:44.777 --> 15:47.071
[Karamo] I just love that you have
no idea what's going on.

15:47.154 --> 15:49.490
I have no… idea. Like…

15:49.573 --> 15:52.242
-[laughing]
-That's the best. We love that.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.702
We really do.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.913
-You ready?
-[Chris] Let's go do it.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.456
[pop music playing]

15:58.666 --> 16:01.669
<i>♪ Maybe we are just the same… ♪</i>

16:01.752 --> 16:06.048
Unfortunately, we still live in a world
where people judge us by the way we look.

16:06.131 --> 16:10.177
So, I wanna empower Chris with
different looks, different vibes, like,

16:10.260 --> 16:15.516
level up the style game so that we can
also level up our fundraising game.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.643
[Tan] My main goal for Chris is that

16:17.726 --> 16:22.398
I want him to see how his new body looks
in clothes that actually fit him.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.651
I want Chris
to see himself the way I see him.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.614
Chris doesn't necessarily
have the information

16:30.698 --> 16:33.993
as to vitamins and the amount
of protein that he should be having.

16:34.076 --> 16:38.163
I wanna make sure that he's getting
what his body actually needs right now.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.208
Chris and Liz have spent
so much time helping others

16:41.291 --> 16:43.877
that they haven't really had time
to make their house a home.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.630
But in order for him
to keep helping people,

16:46.714 --> 16:51.093
he needs a place where he can recharge
with his amazingly wonderful family.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.889
Chris doesn't think that he's worthy
to take the time for himself.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.018
That's why he's always focusing
and trying to help everyone else.

16:59.101 --> 17:02.646
But I want Chris to understand,
it's okay to take time for you.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.024
That's when you start
to get a balanced life.

-What do you want me to do?
-You can check on the toaster.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.247
I just want them lightly toasted.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.165
[Bobby] Lightly.

17:21.248 --> 17:24.084
So, I got some deli turkey.
We have some provolone.

[Chris] Okay, so right now
we're going to the main encampment.

17:54.281 --> 17:57.534
As you can see,
lots of services still needed here.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.453
This is where people
are mostly tent camping

17:59.536 --> 18:02.289
and living in built structures
like these ones you see over here.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.374
Accumulation of garbage is a major issue.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.252
[Bobby] How many people
at any given time live here?

18:07.336 --> 18:10.923
It fluctuates between, like,
160 and maybe, like, 190, 200.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.467
[Bobby] What was it
that inspired you to do this?

18:13.550 --> 18:17.054
Liz was a social worker,
and she worked with this population,

18:17.137 --> 18:19.807
and I brushed up against
being a member of this population

18:19.890 --> 18:21.225
at one time in my life.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.309
Same.

18:22.392 --> 18:25.521
I think if more people took
the time to actually realize

18:25.604 --> 18:26.939
the problem isn't the people,

18:27.022 --> 18:29.775
the problem is
a lot of things in our society.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.527
This is not like,
poof, this just happened.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.444
Right.

18:32.528 --> 18:36.907
This is the inevitable result
of a great many societal problems.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.034
[Bobby] If this pandemic
has taught us anything,

18:39.118 --> 18:40.911
it's that there so many people

18:40.994 --> 18:43.205
that are literally one check away
from homelessness.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.248
Oh, 100%.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.668
Here is the beginnings
of a shelter complex back here.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.003
[Bobby] This is what you're doing
the fundraising for?

18:50.087 --> 18:51.547
[Chris] Yeah, yeah, for 200 of those.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.800
The only work out here that wasn't done
by residents was the electrical install.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.052
[Bobby] The residents
are actually the ones that are--

18:57.136 --> 18:58.595
They're getting paid to do so, right?

18:58.679 --> 18:59.721
-Correct.
-That's awesome.

19:00.806 --> 19:04.518
[Chris] Here we are. Oh, look,
everyone's here. This is exciting.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.770
-Hello!
-Hey, how's it going?

19:06.854 --> 19:08.188
-Welcome.
-[Bobby] Good to see you.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.607
-Welcome to Esperanza.
-Hi, guys.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.985
It's good to see you, brother.
This is looking good.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.444
[Jared] Our foreman here. Enrique.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.947
Enrique, how long does it take
to put one of these together?

19:17.030 --> 19:18.240
About six hours.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.618
That's not bad. Six hours for a house.
What can I do to help?

19:21.702 --> 19:23.537
The shelters are not permanent housing.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.789
Like, they were built for, like, refugees,

19:25.873 --> 19:30.669
and this is the first time these shelters
have ever been used in America.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.630
Which says a lot about
where America is right now.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.549
Got it. Thank you, Enrique.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.509
[Enrique] You gotta
put the bracket in there.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.095
[Bobby] But that's
why Chris wants to do even more

19:40.179 --> 19:42.723
by raising almost $6 million

19:42.806 --> 19:45.517
to make more permanent structures
for this community.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.227
We'll be able to build 200 of those

19:47.311 --> 19:50.772
and then have neighborhoods
of 50 shelter units,

19:50.856 --> 19:52.566
and then bathrooms and showers

19:52.649 --> 19:57.905
and a place to prepare food
and, like, a gathering space in each node.

19:57.988 --> 20:02.618
A community where they can thrive
and that they can raise themselves up.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.161
-There you go.
-Gonna take these.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.580
-An Antoni special.
-[laughs] Oh, awesome.

20:06.663 --> 20:10.042
For people like Chris out there
who have said, "Enough is enough,"

20:10.125 --> 20:12.502
and they're doing whatever they can…

20:12.586 --> 20:17.174
God, we need thousands of Chrises
because these people deserve a home.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.508
All right!

20:18.592 --> 20:20.969
-Good job. Look at all those brackets!
-[laughs]

20:21.053 --> 20:23.513
-[rock music playing]
<i>-♪ You're gonna be all right ♪</i>

20:23.597 --> 20:26.683
<i>-♪ Ooh-hoo! ♪</i>
<i>-♪ Everything is gonna go your way ♪</i>

20:26.767 --> 20:27.601
[Neon barks]

20:29.353 --> 20:30.604
-[Antoni] After you.
-[Chris] Ah.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.522
[Antoni] I'm excited.
This is a great spot.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.941
[Chris] Let's do it.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.442
-Okay.
-Mmm.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.027
[Antoni] The goal is to kind of, like,

20:37.110 --> 20:39.196
figure out how
we can get a lot of nutrients

20:39.279 --> 20:41.615
and vitamins and all the stuff
that your body actually needs,

20:41.698 --> 20:44.201
but in, like, very compressed,
like, concentrated amounts

20:44.284 --> 20:45.953
without irritating your body.

20:46.036 --> 20:49.081
Chris physically can't consume
as much food as he used to

20:49.164 --> 20:50.457
because of this procedure.

20:50.540 --> 20:54.002
But right now, liquids are
very easy for his body to process.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.505
There are many reasons
why I make my own protein drinks.

20:56.588 --> 20:57.881
It's really not that complicated.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.259
So, that's kind of
what I'm, like, here to show you.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.804
I wanna teach him new ways of doing
the same thing that he's been doing.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.889
[Chris] I've been stuck on
one kind of protein shake.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.891
It doesn't start off
looking anything like this.

21:07.975 --> 21:11.186
So how do you tolerate nut butters?
Do you eat peanut butter or almond butter?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.897
-I love peanut butter.
-Oh, great. Let's use peanut butter then.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.483
Yeah, I mean,
I would like to try the almond butter.

21:16.566 --> 21:17.526
So, we can try it.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.485
This is your smoothie.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.612
-Let's get crazy.
-Let's get crazy!

21:20.696 --> 21:21.863
Um, all the nut butters.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.866
This is literally
how I start every single morning.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.368
I start out with a bit of nut milk.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.995
-[Chris] Okay.
-This stuff I love to use.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.788
I'm obsessed with pistachio milk.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.291
It's a little salty, a little sweet.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.709
And then a banana.

21:34.459 --> 21:38.046
I use a plant, like,
a pea-based protein, as opposed to whey.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.424
And then some kind of a nut butter.
So, almond butter.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.551
-And you can scoop all of that in there.
-Okay.

21:43.802 --> 21:44.678
It's thick.

21:44.761 --> 21:48.932
[Antoni] Yep. I personally put, um,
an offensive amount of cinnamon.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.559
-How do you feel about cinnamon?
-Get it.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.977
Okay, let's put a lot.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.480
So, this is protein powder,
but it's pea-based protein.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.984
So it's completely vegan, and this
is the stuff that I use. I really love it.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.153
-Does it have as much protein?
-It really does.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.614
Typically, he uses whey protein,
which is milk-derived,

22:04.698 --> 22:07.826
and that can be hard to digest
for people who've had gastric sleeve.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.287
This is not your packaged smoothie.

22:10.370 --> 22:12.539
I wanna keep everything
as healthy and clean as possible.

22:12.622 --> 22:13.707
Simple as that.

22:14.791 --> 22:15.834
Perfect.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.836
And then we're gonna set this up.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.339
-I start low.
-[whirring]

22:20.422 --> 22:23.508
You don't save time by making
your own smoothie from scratch,

22:23.592 --> 22:26.136
but the fact is it's a lot less expensive,

22:26.219 --> 22:28.805
and you have an awareness
of what you're putting into your body.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.098
Perfect.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.602
And my hope is that once he gets
the hang of it, it becomes as automatic

22:33.685 --> 22:35.312
as already grabbing that, like,

22:35.395 --> 22:37.939
prepackaged protein smoothie out
of a bottle.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.024
Cheers.

22:40.650 --> 22:41.568
Mmm.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.365
Oh, my God, that is so good.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.994
[Antoni] It's seriously the smoothie
I make every single morning.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.746
It's like gingerbread or something.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.040
-It's so good.
-Yeah, it's the cinnamon in there.

22:55.123 --> 22:57.209
Oh, my God, it tastes like Christmas.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.252
It's like a nice--
It tastes like Christmas!

22:59.336 --> 23:00.170
[chuckles] So good.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.255
-In the heat of the summer.
-You just, like, changed…

23:02.339 --> 23:03.465
-[chuckles]
-Oh, my goodness.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.550
[upbeat music playing]

23:12.182 --> 23:13.725
[Tan] Okay, Chris. Ready to shop?

23:13.809 --> 23:15.102
-[Chris] Let's do it.
-[Tan] Good.

23:20.023 --> 23:22.776
Okay, when was the last time
you came shopping?

23:22.859 --> 23:26.446
Um… it has been years.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.074
Outside of, like,
going to Walmart to find the thing

23:29.157 --> 23:30.534
big enough to go on me. [scoffs]

23:30.617 --> 23:34.079
Was that up until the point
where you had the gastric sleeve?

23:34.162 --> 23:35.497
-Yes.
-Okay.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.165
I wanna explain something quick,

23:37.249 --> 23:40.669
'cause I know that anyone
who's actively trying to lose weight

23:40.752 --> 23:44.381
is concerned about buying new clothes
when you think, "Well, I might lose more."

23:44.464 --> 23:47.050
-Right.
-But you are drowning in your clothes.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.803
It does the opposite of what
you probably want your clothes to do.

23:49.886 --> 23:50.720
[Chris] Yeah, right.

23:50.804 --> 23:54.266
So, instead of buying a bunch of
new clothes, obviously that's expensive.

23:54.349 --> 23:59.688
I just take it to the tailor, which I know
seems bougie. I promise it's not.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.399
But you want your clothes
to show off your incredible results.

24:02.482 --> 24:04.359
And right now, it's hiding everything.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.903
Chris is still thinking
that he needs to wear

24:06.987 --> 24:11.408
things that are five sizes too big
to hide the weight that he no longer has.

24:12.033 --> 24:14.870
So, is there a certain look
that you would like?

24:15.704 --> 24:18.290
To be honest, like,
what I would really love,

24:18.373 --> 24:22.586
I wanna be able to put on just,
like, a white T-shirt and a pair of jeans

24:22.669 --> 24:24.004
and go out in the world like that,

24:24.087 --> 24:26.298
which is something that
I've never been able to do.

24:26.381 --> 24:28.925
No, sorry. Why?
It's a white T-shirt and a pair of jeans.

24:29.009 --> 24:32.804
Because it's I don't know, white.
It makes me look like a marshmallow,

24:32.888 --> 24:36.016
and, like, it's more of
a weight-loss thing than a fashion thing.

24:36.099 --> 24:39.603
It's a terrifying thought to, like, put on
a white T-shirt and go out into the world.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.771
Hate the thought of that,
that you feel even restricted

24:41.855 --> 24:44.483
to buy the thing that we use
as the most basic piece.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.444
So, I'm hoping that
by the end of this week,

24:47.527 --> 24:51.281
when you walk into this event
and Liz sees you, that she's like,

24:51.364 --> 24:52.324
"We've got ten minutes."

24:52.908 --> 24:54.117
[laughing]

24:54.201 --> 24:56.244
-So, should we try clothes?
-Let's do it.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.246
-Good.
-I can't promise I'll like it.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.456
But I will try anything.

24:59.539 --> 25:02.584
-I've got some things in the fitting room.
-Okay.

25:02.667 --> 25:06.588
I want Chris
to understand clothes matter.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.256
The way you style yourself matters.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.926
It really can be the tipping point

25:11.009 --> 25:14.763
of how you view yourself
and whether you view yourself kindly.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.224
-Chris, you ready?
-Ready.

25:18.308 --> 25:21.478
[Tan] Oi! I don't know who this guy is.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.188
[chuckles] I don't know who this guy is.

25:23.271 --> 25:25.232
Come take a look
at yourself in the mirror.

25:26.149 --> 25:27.317
And you'll stop…

25:27.400 --> 25:28.443
Wow!

25:29.194 --> 25:31.363
-[Tan] Um, Chris.
-Yes.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.448
[Tan] What do you think?

25:33.532 --> 25:34.616
[Chris] I like it.

25:34.699 --> 25:35.951
It's very different.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.161
-I, uh--
-Different good?

25:38.245 --> 25:41.081
-[Chris] Oh, yeah. I really like this.
-Good.

25:41.164 --> 25:44.543
-I thought this would've felt too small.
-Yeah.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.670
Now that I'm looking at myself,
it looks awesome.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.005
-It's not tight at all.
-It looks great.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.090
I like these colors.

25:50.173 --> 25:52.801
-And I like the layered look.
-Yeah.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.178
-Can I explain why I've done the layered?
-Yes.

25:55.262 --> 25:59.182
When I layer, nobody can really see your
shape underneath 'cause this just grazes.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.893
It gives you some shape,
but hides a little as well.

26:02.602 --> 26:06.273
So, this is for outside of work.

26:06.356 --> 26:09.234
I'm not saying that
this is your look for investors.

26:09.317 --> 26:11.361
It's still very casual.

26:11.444 --> 26:12.988
When you go and meet investors,

26:13.071 --> 26:17.284
I've got other options for you
that I'm gonna put in your cl-- [laughs]

26:17.367 --> 26:19.494
-Stare! I want you to look at yourself!
-Yeah, yeah.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.705
[Tan] I want you to feel
the things that you're feeling.

26:21.788 --> 26:22.664
I don't hate it.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.583
-Is it nice?
-It is nice.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.961
-Do you wanna continue to feel like this?
-Let's continue to feel like this.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.052
All right.

26:38.221 --> 26:39.097
[Chris] I like it.

26:39.723 --> 26:40.974
It's very rock and roll.

26:41.474 --> 26:43.727
-Yeah, it is!
-[laughs]

26:43.810 --> 26:45.103
[Tan] Yes, confidence!

26:45.186 --> 26:48.106
[Chris] Sorry. I've never had, like,
a pair of high-topped shoes before.

26:48.189 --> 26:52.444
Yeah. So, it's a jean. It's a T-shirt.

26:52.527 --> 26:53.695
-Mm-hmm.
-And it's a shirt.

26:53.778 --> 26:58.033
-Right.
-Nothing fancy. So, do you feel sexy?

27:00.285 --> 27:02.746
-I-- [laughs]
-[Tan chuckles]

27:02.829 --> 27:03.663
Maybe.

27:03.747 --> 27:07.542
I know you won't say it. You look
like a sexy guy. Effortlessly cool.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.752
Wow.

27:08.835 --> 27:12.047
I want you to have the confidence
that you seem to be displaying now.

27:12.714 --> 27:16.009
-Right on.
-[laughs] Yeah. Yes, please.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.303
-You pose however you wanna pose.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.110
What are you saying "Oh, my God" for?

27:34.194 --> 27:36.613
[Chris] I just saw him.
He was like Spider-Man over there.

27:36.696 --> 27:38.573
-Andy, you scared my friend.
-[Andy] Sorry.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.367
-Andy, Chris. Chris, Andy.
-[Andy] What's up?

27:40.450 --> 27:41.576
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

-[Karamo] What do you think of this spot?
-Wild.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.541
It's like a big jungle gym.
My daughter would love it.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.503
[Karamo] Yeah… I'm bringing Chris
to this gym to help him to understand

27:51.586 --> 27:55.507
that because of his self-esteem issues
and the guilt and shame he's holding onto,

27:55.590 --> 27:58.009
he's afraid to face up to things
that are going on in his life.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.719
So, he just focuses on work.

27:59.803 --> 28:03.014
But it's causing him
to have a lack of balance.

28:03.098 --> 28:06.267
When we had talked,
one of the main things was,

28:06.351 --> 28:08.728
there's no balance
happening in your life right now.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.772
-I would largely agree with that, yeah.
-Yeah.

28:10.855 --> 28:14.734
Do you think you deserve forgiveness?

28:15.735 --> 28:19.364
I… I don't know.
It's hard to say. I mean, I, um…

28:19.447 --> 28:23.827
I… I mean, intellectually, I think so.
Emotionally, it's much harder.

28:23.910 --> 28:26.246
I guess maybe I deserve it
as much as everybody else does.

28:26.329 --> 28:27.414
[Karamo] You guess?

28:27.497 --> 28:28.748
Yeah, I mean…

28:28.832 --> 28:32.877
I know. It's, like, my mantra in life,
is that every person deserves that.

28:32.961 --> 28:36.005
Yeah, you're right. You do deserve that.

28:36.881 --> 28:39.676
Why is it harder for you
to forgive yourself emotionally?

28:39.759 --> 28:41.761
[emotional music playing]

28:43.680 --> 28:45.890
What's the guilt you're holding onto?

28:47.267 --> 28:50.478
At the end of my mom's life, I was
giving her the medication that we knew

28:50.562 --> 28:53.523
would ultimately lead
to her heart stopping.

28:53.606 --> 28:57.694
And then when this really was like,
"Oh, this is gonna happen,"

28:57.777 --> 29:00.029
so much family came and stuff
and, like, friends.

29:00.613 --> 29:04.367
But I was, like,
left to deal with this piece of it,

29:04.451 --> 29:07.162
and I was surrounded by family,

29:07.245 --> 29:10.707
but I was completely alone
in dealing with that part of it.

29:11.541 --> 29:15.295
And I fell asleep in the bed.

29:16.629 --> 29:17.630
On the drugs.

29:18.965 --> 29:23.470
And slept probably six hours…

29:24.387 --> 29:27.182
[scoffs] …next to a dead body.

29:28.892 --> 29:29.976
This shit is… up, man.

29:30.059 --> 29:32.187
-None of that was your fault.
-Yep.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.523
And I know you keep
saying "yep" intellectually.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.816
Yeah, yeah.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.194
[Karamo] But you have to
start receiving this.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.987
It wasn't your fault.

29:41.070 --> 29:43.573
So you need to accept
and forgive your past

29:43.656 --> 29:47.577
so that you can be joyful
and present right now.

29:47.660 --> 29:49.746
Because connection
with your wife and your family

29:49.829 --> 29:51.831
and with yourself
is what's most important.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.625
-It's time.
-It's time.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.335
It's time that's gonna take.

29:55.418 --> 29:56.753
This is the first step.

29:57.420 --> 29:58.546
Well done.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.258
But with me,
I also like to have a little fun.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.468
-So…
-Yeah.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.929
-I invited somebody here.
-Oh, gosh.

30:06.012 --> 30:07.639
-I'm gonna be right back.
-Oh, no.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.057
[Karamo] What? Don't feel bad.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.475
It's good.

30:11.184 --> 30:14.062
[hums fanfare]

30:14.145 --> 30:17.565
-It's your baby mama!
-Hey!

30:17.649 --> 30:18.650
Hello!

30:19.651 --> 30:20.735
Oh!

30:20.819 --> 30:22.570
-How are you?
-[Liz] I'm good. How are you?

30:22.654 --> 30:24.656
-It's good to see you. Good.
-You too.

30:24.739 --> 30:27.408
-So, you still gotta have fun.
-[Chris] Yeah.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.327
And you've taken the time out of your day.

30:29.410 --> 30:32.872
So, I was like, why don't you two
get to spend some time here together?

30:32.956 --> 30:34.207
Finding balance, but having fun.

30:34.290 --> 30:35.375
Let's have a good time.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.293
-So we'll start with this one.
-All right.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.171
I'm here. In case you need it. Ready?

30:41.089 --> 30:43.132
-Nice. You're doing it.
-No.

30:46.261 --> 30:47.679
[grunts]

30:47.762 --> 30:50.223
[Karamo] None of us
are our worst decisions.

30:50.306 --> 30:52.642
We all have
the opportunity to grow and be better

30:52.725 --> 30:55.019
and to create a life
that we're happy with.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.481
-[all shouting]
-[Chris] Oh, hey!

30:58.565 --> 30:59.691
[laughing]

30:59.774 --> 31:02.777
I want Chris to understand that
he is worthy of taking time for himself

31:02.861 --> 31:04.654
so that he can get the balance in his life

31:04.737 --> 31:07.198
and start to connect
with the people he loves.

31:08.157 --> 31:09.993
-[Liz] Love you.
-[kisses] I love you too.

31:16.833 --> 31:20.169
[Bobby] I can tell that Chris feels guilty
getting any help from us

31:20.253 --> 31:23.840
or any love from us because
of what he sees on a daily basis.

31:23.923 --> 31:27.886
Chris deserves a wonderful, happy home

31:27.969 --> 31:31.681
because he gives back so, so much.

31:31.764 --> 31:34.183
This week, it's all about Chris.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.894
[rock music playing]

31:41.065 --> 31:44.402
<i>♪ Better than ever, never the same… ♪</i>

31:44.485 --> 31:45.778
[Jonathan] You having a fun day?

31:45.862 --> 31:48.281
[Chris] So far, this has been
the best day yet. This is so fun.

31:48.364 --> 31:49.782
-Come on in.
-[Chris] All right.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.577
-Hi, Aroutin, Santiago. How are you?
-How are you?

31:52.660 --> 31:54.287
Welcome to Shed.

31:54.370 --> 31:55.830
-[Chris] Thanks.
-Yeah, definitely.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.790
[Jonathan] Yes, yes, yes!

31:57.874 --> 31:59.876
-Can I take your hat off?
-[Chris] You may.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.212
-Okay.
-[Chris] There's a lot going on, huh?

32:03.296 --> 32:05.465
-There's just a couple things.
-[Chris laughs]

32:05.548 --> 32:07.967
Not that much stuff.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.969
[Chris] After all the conversations
I had today,

32:10.053 --> 32:14.057
I think what I've realized is that, like,
the bleaching and the dyeing and the blue

32:14.140 --> 32:18.728
was all, like, part of an attempt
to pull focus away from other things.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.897
-I think I'm over it.
-Me too!

32:21.481 --> 32:22.690
So what my goal is today

32:22.774 --> 32:27.028
is to land the hair color correction
triple Axel that is

32:27.111 --> 32:29.030
making someone's hair look salt-and-pepper

32:29.113 --> 32:32.158
that has, like, done
this sort of thing to their hair.

32:32.241 --> 32:35.119
I'm ready to single-foot this landing.
I think it's gonna be really fun.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.288
And we're gonna
make your hair look natural and gorg.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.208
-Give you salt-and-pepper zaddy realness.
-Nice.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.381
Chris just needs to have
the confidence that says,

32:46.464 --> 32:49.467
"Yeah, I know how to deal
with housing insecurity."

32:49.550 --> 32:52.512
"I know how
to deal with advocating for folks

32:52.595 --> 32:55.598
in a gorgeous, confident, kind way."

32:55.682 --> 32:57.433
So, we're gonna help him do that.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.602
What do you do after,
like, a really hard week?

32:59.686 --> 33:01.646
Is it fair to say that
you have a hard time,

33:01.729 --> 33:03.481
like, stopping to take care of yourself?

33:03.564 --> 33:06.442
Yeah. It's so funny
'cause I'm like, even doing this,

33:06.526 --> 33:08.486
I'm still trying to,
like, coordinate things.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.196
"Can I help? Is there something I can do?"

33:10.279 --> 33:13.825
Right. I do think
when you see so much suffering,

33:14.409 --> 33:16.536
it makes you constantly feel guilty.

33:16.619 --> 33:20.581
Like, there's so much violence
against the trans non-binary community.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.625
And so, because I am aware of this,

33:22.709 --> 33:25.712
it makes me feel like
I could always be doing more.

33:25.795 --> 33:29.048
A lot of times when
you're really rooted in advocacy,

33:29.132 --> 33:31.884
all of the things that
you get to enjoy in your life,

33:31.968 --> 33:33.720
it has a different impact when you realize

33:33.803 --> 33:35.722
that so many
other people don't have those joys.

33:35.805 --> 33:38.433
But I think that at some point,
like, you have to turn off.

33:38.558 --> 33:43.062
Because if you expect yourself
to, like, cure, like, the systemic issues,

33:43.146 --> 33:44.522
you're gonna be in a world of hurt,

33:44.605 --> 33:46.858
not able to keep doing
what you're so passionate about.

33:46.941 --> 33:48.359
-You're gonna burn out.
-Yeah.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.988
If you don't take care of yourself,
you can't show up for other people

33:52.071 --> 33:53.406
as much as you want to.

33:53.489 --> 33:58.327
I definitely have felt moments
of compassion fatigue.

33:58.411 --> 34:01.456
I wonder if that's 'cause you don't feel
like you have compassion for yourself.

34:01.539 --> 34:02.790
[Chris] Ha ha!

34:10.423 --> 34:11.841
-You okay?
-I'm okay.

34:11.924 --> 34:14.510
[Jonathan] Why are you
looking at your hands?

34:14.594 --> 34:17.138
Honestly, I'm trying to, like,
make sure that I'm not just,

34:17.221 --> 34:19.182
like, in a dream, kind of, like…

34:19.265 --> 34:21.642
-Aww, hunty, it's real.
-It's just-- This is so…

34:21.726 --> 34:23.478
-I'm your fairy godparent.
-[laughs]

34:23.561 --> 34:26.022
And I'm here to tell you, you are hot as…

34:26.105 --> 34:31.194

and space to nurture yourself.

34:31.277 --> 34:34.113
[humming]

34:37.408 --> 34:40.078
Um, can I just get a slow clap
for this hair color?

34:40.161 --> 34:43.247
Like, I opened a can
of whoop-ass on this hair color.

-Chris, are you ready?
-I'm ready.

34:57.595 --> 35:00.098
[Jonathan] Don't look quite yet
'cause I wanna emphasize,

35:00.181 --> 35:02.975
you didn't need to change
how you physically look

35:03.059 --> 35:05.770
for people to take you seriously
as an activist

35:05.853 --> 35:09.649
and as someone that is really a pillar
of their community who is doing good.

35:09.732 --> 35:13.402
So, just know that.

35:35.675 --> 35:37.468
No, it's good. It looks great.

35:37.552 --> 35:38.553
-Doesn't it?
-I--

35:41.013 --> 35:42.348
I can't… I don't know.

35:42.431 --> 35:44.517
-Get up in it. You can get all up in it.
-All right.

35:45.226 --> 35:48.229
It's… crazy.
This is, like, a totally different--

35:52.775 --> 35:54.527
-He's pretty good-looking.
-Isn't he?

$6 million for people who need it."

39:28.199 --> 39:30.034
[Bobby] Whole new island.
Whole new island!

39:30.117 --> 39:32.453
[Chris] Oh, my God.
Okay. This is a new house.

39:32.536 --> 39:33.746
[Bobby] It kind of is.

39:35.039 --> 39:38.334
-This is so sick!
-[laughs]

39:39.085 --> 39:42.588
Look, you have a new hood.
There's no more bare wires.

39:42.671 --> 39:43.631
What's that?

39:44.215 --> 39:46.884
-[Bobby] Juicer.
-Oh, yes!

39:46.967 --> 39:48.886
-My guy!
-[laughs]

39:49.470 --> 39:53.015
[Chris] Oh, my God! This is so amazing!

39:53.099 --> 39:55.601
Where's Karamo? I deserve this, don't I?

39:55.684 --> 39:57.103
Yes, you do deserve this.

39:57.186 --> 40:00.439
You do deserve this! Yes, you do!

40:00.523 --> 40:02.108
[Chris] I get to live here now.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.652
-[Bobby] Ready?
-[Antoni] Ooh, I like this bench.

40:04.735 --> 40:07.279
Whoa!

40:08.656 --> 40:10.950
-[Bobby] Right?
-[Jonathan] Romance!

40:11.033 --> 40:12.701
This is a story of texture.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.286
[Chris] Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!

40:14.370 --> 40:16.664
[Jonathan] It's like a full-on proper
adult home, queen.

40:16.747 --> 40:20.960
These are the most beautiful
nightstand side tables I've ever seen.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.671
[Chris] Oh, my God! Look at those!

40:23.754 --> 40:25.923
See some cute pictures I found?

40:26.006 --> 40:27.383
[Fab Five laughing] Aww.

40:29.135 --> 40:31.512
[Chris] I'm sorry, this is so beautiful.

40:31.595 --> 40:34.056
-[Tan] Yeah, we'll take that.
-[Bobby] That's nice.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.099
[Jonathan] Yeah, queen.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.893
[Chris] Look at this place that we're in.

40:37.977 --> 40:40.855
[Karamo] You talked to me a bit about
the trauma that this house held.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.273
The house is different.

40:42.356 --> 40:46.485
I want you to purposefully make
new memories in those spaces

40:46.569 --> 40:49.071
to remind yourself that
those things weren't your fault.

40:49.155 --> 40:52.366
Don't hold guilt around it. That's part of
the practice of knowing what you deserve.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.494
But you have to do the work
to love yourself more and heal yourself.

40:55.578 --> 41:00.166
I don't know that I've ever had
such a profound moment

41:00.249 --> 41:03.711
of celebration of self
ever before in my life.

41:03.794 --> 41:06.046
-Yeah, it's gonna take practice.
-I know.

41:06.130 --> 41:09.842
That's what's gonna change you from having
unhealthy boundaries and connections

41:09.925 --> 41:13.304
to having really healthy ones,
because you know what you deserve.

41:13.387 --> 41:14.388
I believe in you.

41:15.055 --> 41:15.890
So do I.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.684
-[scoffs]
-I believe in me.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.269
-My guy.
-We can do this.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.023
We're gonna take a quick look…

41:24.106 --> 41:27.776
-Oh, my God.
-…in your closet.

41:28.527 --> 41:30.779
I want you to still feel
a little bit rocker.

41:30.863 --> 41:33.115
That is your vibe
that I don't wanna take away from you.

41:33.199 --> 41:36.285
So, we got you a gorgeous leather.

41:36.368 --> 41:39.622
Something that's gonna make you
feel like the real you. Isn't that nice?

41:39.705 --> 41:41.540
Oh, that is nice.

41:41.624 --> 41:44.668
I just want you to see
the version of you that I see

41:44.752 --> 41:46.295
when you're asking for donations.

41:46.378 --> 41:49.006
-And so, I wanna see you in a suit.
-All right.

41:49.089 --> 41:50.758
We're gonna start with a white tee.

41:50.841 --> 41:53.677
This has been
almost like a nemesis for you. [chuckles]

41:54.220 --> 41:55.137
-Yeah.
-So…

41:55.221 --> 41:57.681
I'm going to get you to wear this, please.

41:57.765 --> 41:58.599
Okay.

41:58.682 --> 42:02.019
We got you a beautiful blue suit,

42:02.102 --> 42:03.687
and I'm just gonna to give you a sneaker.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.731
-That's it.
-Okay, sounds great.

42:07.107 --> 42:08.359
Okay, kids. Are we all ready?

42:08.442 --> 42:11.487
-Yeah!
-Okay, great. Come on out, Chris.

42:11.570 --> 42:13.531
-Oh!
-Handsome!

42:13.614 --> 42:15.908
-[Bobby] I want to give you my money!
-[Antoni] A suit!

42:15.991 --> 42:17.451
Love!

42:17.535 --> 42:19.286
-Oh, my!
-[Jonathan] Wow!

42:19.370 --> 42:21.455
So handsome! So dapper!

42:21.539 --> 42:23.457
-[Antoni] Yep.
-[Bobby] It's just perfect for you.

42:23.541 --> 42:26.752
He's never been able to wear
a white T-shirt because he sees that as

42:26.835 --> 42:29.588
not looking right on a person of his size.

42:29.672 --> 42:33.717
And so, I wanted you to see that
you can wear this and feel comfortable

42:33.801 --> 42:37.513
and not see it as a challenge anymore,
'cause there's no reason for it to be.

42:38.097 --> 42:40.432
-[Antoni] Yeah.
-Yeah! How do you feel?

42:40.516 --> 42:42.476
[Chris] I feel like

42:43.102 --> 42:45.646
my sexy ass is about
to be, like, a world leader, darling.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.314
-[Karamo cheering]
-[Tan laughing]

42:47.398 --> 42:49.692
[Jonathan] That came out of left field,
but I'm into it.

42:49.775 --> 42:51.569
Oh, my God.

42:51.652 --> 42:52.987
[Antoni] Your hair looks killer.

42:53.070 --> 42:58.450
You have been one of the most
receptive heroes I've ever worked with…

42:58.534 --> 43:00.244
-Yes, agree.
-…quite honestly, on our show.

43:00.327 --> 43:02.746
And that's because
you trusted us immediately.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.873
And the way you're
carrying yourself is beautiful.

43:04.957 --> 43:08.002
And so from the bottom of my heart,
I wanna say thank you, truly thank you.

43:08.961 --> 43:11.547
Aww, thank you. Aww.

43:11.630 --> 43:12.923
-We love you.
-Oh, love you.

43:13.007 --> 43:14.925
[Jonathan] It's your house,
and you live here.

43:15.009 --> 43:17.428
-[Chris] I live in this place.
-Yes, you do.

43:17.511 --> 43:19.013
I live in this resort, queen.

43:19.096 --> 43:22.600
-You really do. It is a resort, queen.
-Love you. Enjoy.

43:23.183 --> 43:25.686
-Thanks, brother. Had a great time.
-[Bobby] Me too.

43:26.645 --> 43:28.439
-[Jonathan] Love you.
-Thank you.

43:28.522 --> 43:30.316
Bye! Yas, queen!

43:30.399 --> 43:31.692

Yes! You ready to see how
our house has totally crazy changed?

43:54.173 --> 43:57.635
Oh, my God. You look amazing.

43:57.718 --> 43:58.677
So do you.

43:59.345 --> 44:00.346
[Althea] Oh!

44:00.429 --> 44:04.308
[laughs] Children got ahead a little.
Wait, Althea, wait, wait, wait.

44:11.732 --> 44:13.567
-[Chris] Come see.
-[Liz] Oh, my God!

44:13.651 --> 44:15.152
[son] The living room.

44:15.235 --> 44:18.364
-[Chris] Look at the size of this island.
-[Liz] Oh, my God!

44:18.447 --> 44:20.866
Come up here! Look at your room!

44:20.949 --> 44:23.952
-So cool, right?
-[son] In here! In here! In here!

44:24.703 --> 44:28.582
Holy smokes! Oh!

44:28.666 --> 44:31.168
[Althea] Oh, my gosh!

44:31.251 --> 44:35.714
This week was in the top three
most intense weeks of my entire life.

44:35.798 --> 44:38.175
To bed! [grunts]

44:38.258 --> 44:39.885
It was worth every second of it.

44:39.968 --> 44:43.180
-I have some nice fresh basil here too.
-I would love some basil.

44:43.263 --> 44:44.848
I'm gonna give you some basil.

44:44.932 --> 44:49.436
All of a sudden, I feel as valuable
as anyone else, and it's just such a joy.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.272
I feel very happy and confident.

44:52.356 --> 44:55.109
-Your new look is super, super sweet.
-Nice.

44:58.570 --> 45:00.072
Chris is an angel.

45:00.155 --> 45:02.449
People look up to him. People respect him.

45:02.533 --> 45:06.412
And moving forward, I want him
to respect and look up to himself too.

45:08.038 --> 45:09.039
[Fab Five] Hey!

45:09.123 --> 45:10.332
How's it going?

45:11.125 --> 45:13.419
-Do you miss us?
-Yeah!

45:13.502 --> 45:14.837
'Cause we miss you!

45:14.920 --> 45:16.213
Who do you miss the most?

45:16.880 --> 45:20.968
<i>-Tan.</i>
-Yeah! That makes me so happy!

45:21.051 --> 45:25.097
I hope Chris can really
see how amazing he is

45:25.180 --> 45:28.308
and what a difference
he is making in so many people's lives.

45:28.392 --> 45:31.812
Chris, how you feel about your event?
You think you're gonna reach your goal?

45:31.895 --> 45:34.523
<i>-I know we're gonna reach the goal.</i>
-Yeah! There you go.

45:34.606 --> 45:36.400
[Bobby] Confidence, I love it.

45:36.483 --> 45:37.401
[Jonathan] Yes.

45:38.444 --> 45:41.697
Oh, my God. I've heard so much about you.
It's so nice to meet you. Yeah.

45:44.366 --> 45:46.952
-Hey, Alex, Chris Baker. Nice to meet you.
-[Alex] Nice to meet you.

45:48.829 --> 45:50.748
-You're awesome. [laughs]
-Oh, thanks, brother.

45:50.831 --> 45:53.917
Tonight, it's my pleasure
to introduce you to my friend,

45:54.543 --> 45:58.255
the executive director of
The Other Ones Foundation, Chris Baker.

45:58.338 --> 46:00.340
[crowd cheering]

46:01.592 --> 46:04.928
The thing that I love the most
about this evolution of Chris is that

46:05.012 --> 46:07.389
you can finally see that his inside,

46:07.473 --> 46:10.851
the beauty, the love,
matches what's going on, on the outside.

46:11.477 --> 46:15.105
I'm so grateful and so happy
to be here with all of you.

46:15.189 --> 46:17.191
He looks like a new man.

46:17.274 --> 46:20.277
This is the first day
of the rest of his life.

46:20.360 --> 46:26.533
We here in Austin, Texas, we are
going to continue to be part of a solution

46:26.617 --> 46:28.285
to get people off of the street.

46:28.911 --> 46:30.454
Next Wednesday, we're gonna go

46:30.537 --> 46:33.373
and sign the state of Texas
to take full control of the property.

46:33.457 --> 46:35.334
[crowd cheering]

46:35.417 --> 46:39.046
He truly sees every single person
as equal, and he's helping his community.

46:40.214 --> 46:41.423
He's a true hero.

46:41.507 --> 46:42.925
Thank you, everybody, for being here

46:43.008 --> 46:45.385
and for your willingness
to contribute to solutions.

46:45.511 --> 46:47.638
-I love you.
-[crowd cheering]

46:47.721 --> 46:49.181
[Tan] He's such a good guy.

46:49.264 --> 46:50.557
-I like him so much.
-So cute!

46:50.641 --> 46:52.810
Can we just give it up
one more time for Chris?

46:52.893 --> 46:53.811
Cheers to Chris!

46:53.894 --> 46:54.937
[all] To Chris!

47:01.193 --> 47:05.280
Found an item of clothing that you
absolutely love, but don't love the fit?

47:05.364 --> 47:06.323
Alter it yourself.

47:06.406 --> 47:10.118
If you can learn one simple stitch,
the running stitch,

47:10.202 --> 47:12.454
you can make your own alterations.

47:12.538 --> 47:15.207
A sewing machine will
set you back around about $100.

47:15.290 --> 47:19.253
But it will save you hundreds,
if not thousands on alterations.

47:19.336 --> 47:20.671
I'm gonna snip it.

47:24.591 --> 47:27.052
See? Alterations made easy.

47:27.135 --> 47:29.263
