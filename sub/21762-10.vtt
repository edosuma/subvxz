misjudged the situation.

I thought you were in danger,

can see that a kingdom

Where are you going?

05:38.087 --> 05:39.088
King Julien's right.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.424
If everyone is able to defend themselves,

05:41.507 --> 05:42.967
what use do they have for me?

What do you make
of all these scorpions, Mort?

08:37.808 --> 08:40.728
Hm. The last one I ate needed salt.

No, I mean, are they a good idea?

by those scorpions, man.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.099
I'm feeling a little threatened.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.852
Don't make me do something
I don't wanna do.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.979
Oh, you wanna get loco, Willie?

10:05.062 --> 10:06.606
Let's get loco!

10:06.689 --> 10:08.691
You both better stand down

10:08.774 --> 10:10.943
or you're entering a world of hurtin'.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.862
[Western music playing]

10:20.786 --> 10:21.621
[sniffs]

10:28.628 --> 10:30.129
[gasps] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:30.212 --> 10:31.756
What's going on here?

10:31.839 --> 10:35.217
These perps are trying to steal my mango.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.511
I'm gonna neutralize them.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.138
Since when do you say words like

10:39.221 --> 10:40.848
"perp" and "neutralize," Willie?

10:40.931 --> 10:44.644
Since I became responsible
for protecting what's mine.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.895
That's Clover's job.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.105
Clover ain't here, Chico.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.649
We're the law now.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.193
There's gotta be a better way
to settle a dispute.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.904
-Yeah, like knives maybe?
-[sighs]

10:54.987 --> 10:57.573
Everybody just calmly
lower your scorpions.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.200
Nice and slow.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.919
[whimpering]

11:12.129 --> 11:13.130
[slurps]

11:15.758 --> 11:16.634
[slurps]

11:17.760 --> 11:18.594
Oh...

11:19.678 --> 11:20.930
Surprise attack!

11:21.013 --> 11:22.681
[both shouting in pain]

11:23.849 --> 11:25.309
[laughing mockingly]

11:27.853 --> 11:29.522
[shouting in pain]

11:34.568 --> 11:36.028
[all three shouting in pain]

11:38.739 --> 11:40.241
These scorpions are outta control!

11:40.366 --> 11:41.909
[all clamoring]

11:42.618 --> 11:44.161
We gotta stop this, Mort.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.496
Mort?

11:46.831 --> 11:47.790
What?

11:47.873 --> 11:49.917
Do I have something in my teeth?

11:54.004 --> 11:55.589
[Clover grunting]

11:58.467 --> 12:00.010
[growling]

12:00.094 --> 12:03.389
Almost. You just need to chill
a little harder.

12:03.472 --> 12:06.684
Really slow down and feel your chi.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.732
Hi-yah!

12:14.525 --> 12:17.695
And then some happy trees, happy clouds,

12:17.778 --> 12:19.572
a slightly depressed hillside,

12:19.655 --> 12:21.866
a lake that needs to forgive itself.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.493
See? Isn't this therapeutic?

12:25.035 --> 12:28.581
-[exclaims in horror]
-See, this here is Norge Grendelfist.

12:28.664 --> 12:29.999
Hello, hello, Norge.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.960
And here is his loyal squire,
Vestigial Kruntz.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.588
And what about all the...

12:35.671 --> 12:36.589
Slain enemies?

12:36.672 --> 12:39.925
They were stupid enough
to challenge Norge Grendelfist.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.261
That's also where
the rivers of blood came from.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.389
I have a strong feeling
my night terrors will be back.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.975
You know,
maybe let's try a few other hobbies?

12:48.058 --> 12:50.519
We'll find something to chill you out.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.815
[grunting]

12:56.650 --> 12:57.485
Wow.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.695
[panting] I think it's working.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.323
I have this overwhelming sense of calm.

13:02.406 --> 13:03.699
I knew we'd find it.

13:03.782 --> 13:06.243
Great work, by the way.
Looks just like you.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.079
Oh. [chuckles] It's actually my sister.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.624
You must really love her a lot.

13:11.707 --> 13:14.126
Yeah. Sure, I mean, well,
you know, [stammers]

13:14.210 --> 13:15.294
we've had our differences.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.755
She did steal my sort-of boyfriend,

13:17.838 --> 13:19.298
and tried to kill me, actually.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.759
Once. Nope, nope.
That happened a lot of times, yeah.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.220
And she's cruel [chuckles]
and she's selfish

13:24.303 --> 13:27.681
[screaming] and she was always
Mum and Dad's favorite! [squeals]

13:27.765 --> 13:28.599
[screams]

13:29.266 --> 13:31.810
Yeah. Family's complicated.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.981
[making shooting noises]

13:38.943 --> 13:39.902
Oh! Look up there!

13:39.985 --> 13:40.945
A thing!

13:41.529 --> 13:43.531
Get the villagers to safety.

13:48.827 --> 13:49.828
[Maurice clears throat]

13:49.912 --> 13:52.039
Uh... How long have you guys been...

13:52.122 --> 13:53.958
watching me play with my scorpion?

13:54.041 --> 13:56.335
King Julien, we need to talk
about the scorpion problem.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.170
We don't have a scorpion problem,

13:58.254 --> 14:00.256
we have a scorpion solution.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.007
[exclaims in pain] Ow.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.592
These things are dangerous-- [exclaims]

14:03.676 --> 14:05.052
Bird demon!

14:05.135 --> 14:06.595
Very dangerous.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.055
That's why every lemur in the kingdom

14:08.138 --> 14:10.099
needs a scorpion or five.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.433
What are you doing here?

14:11.517 --> 14:13.894
Andy here is helping me
to get the word out

14:13.978 --> 14:16.021
about how great scorpions are,

14:16.105 --> 14:18.899
and how everybody's gonna get robbed
or mugged

14:18.983 --> 14:20.025
if they don't have one.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.403
Our kingdom doesn't have a crime problem.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.946
Your Majesty, please.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.365
These citizens here with me
have had enough.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.492
-That's true.
-[all chattering]

14:29.243 --> 14:32.371
Oh. They've had enough
of feeling safe and confident?

14:32.454 --> 14:35.749
Gee, that's a strange thing
to want less of.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.043
[all murmuring]

14:38.127 --> 14:39.086
[sighs]

14:40.588 --> 14:42.339
Maurice, I hear what you're saying.

14:42.423 --> 14:46.343
If you want me
to get rid of my scorpion, well,

14:46.427 --> 14:49.889
[shouting] you'll have to pry it
from my cold, dead paws, buddy!

14:50.014 --> 14:50.973
[laughs]

14:51.056 --> 14:53.017
[groans]
The scorpions are making everyone

14:53.100 --> 14:55.644
more aggressive
and accidents are happening.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.315
Huh?

15:01.609 --> 15:02.651
-Ah!
-Intruder!

15:03.903 --> 15:05.446
Darn it, Dorothy! Ow!

15:05.529 --> 15:09.158
I dropped my keys down the commode
at kickboxing class. [exclaims in pain]

15:09.241 --> 15:12.244
[sing-song] Cleanin' my scorp
without a care in the world.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.246
[screaming in pain]

15:14.330 --> 15:15.831
Ah! Ow! Oh!

15:19.126 --> 15:19.960
Hey!

15:22.171 --> 15:23.672
[lemurs murmuring inside]

15:23.756 --> 15:24.673
They found me!

15:25.341 --> 15:26.175
[lemurs] Surprise!

15:26.425 --> 15:27.801
Chew on that, you scum!

15:27.885 --> 15:29.386
[lemurs clamoring inside]

15:29.470 --> 15:31.138
[continues screaming in pain]

15:32.681 --> 15:33.515
Hey!

15:35.351 --> 15:36.477
Wow, really?

15:36.560 --> 15:39.396
Well, if this is true,
maybe we should get rid of--

15:39.480 --> 15:43.567
The silly notion that fewer scorpions
mean less danger. Ha, ha, ha!

15:43.651 --> 15:46.195
Did you know
kingdoms with the least scorpions

15:46.278 --> 15:47.655
are the most dangerous?

15:47.738 --> 15:48.781
Is that true?

15:48.864 --> 15:50.574
I sure said it like it is.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.327
Can we just use our brains here
for a minute?

15:53.410 --> 15:55.204
Stop treadin' on us, Maurice!

15:55.329 --> 15:58.082
[talking incoherently]

15:58.165 --> 16:00.668
He's still kinda swollen
on account of getting stung in the face

16:00.751 --> 16:03.045
160 times, but he agrees!

16:03.170 --> 16:04.129
[all murmuring]

16:04.213 --> 16:05.422
[screaming in pain]

16:06.632 --> 16:08.550
Don't you all love your families

16:08.634 --> 16:12.346
and want to keep 'em safe
from robbers and killers?

16:12.429 --> 16:14.390
Even if he doesn't.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.516
That's not fair!

16:15.599 --> 16:17.935
He's just using flattery and fear
to coerce you.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.062
And boy, is it working.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.023
[sighs] It looks
like the people have spoken.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.733
They want their scorpions.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.776
Yeah, they do!

16:25.859 --> 16:28.988
Because we know
scorpions don't sting lemurs.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.240
Lemurs sting lemurs!

16:31.323 --> 16:32.950
That doesn't make any sense.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.536
As long as there's a lemur there
to control them,

16:35.619 --> 16:38.080
these scorpions pose no threat.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.166
Could they easily take over the kingdom
because they outnumber us?

16:41.250 --> 16:42.251
Sure.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.920
But they're too dumb
to ever figure that out.

16:45.004 --> 16:45.921
[squealing]

16:46.630 --> 16:47.673
[both squealing]

16:49.633 --> 16:52.511
Uh-oh. I think
the food-bugs are mad at us.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.266
Eh... Is this normal?

16:57.391 --> 16:59.184
[all lemurs shouting]

17:03.355 --> 17:04.857
[all shouting in panic]

17:04.940 --> 17:06.483
You've got to do something, man!

17:06.567 --> 17:08.193
You're right. How 'bout I leave?

17:08.277 --> 17:10.154
Later, suckers! [laughing]

17:16.869 --> 17:18.078
[everyone clamoring]

17:20.414 --> 17:23.000
[exclaiming in fear] I'm in the dark here!

17:27.546 --> 17:28.881
Om...

17:28.964 --> 17:31.258
How long have we been meditating now?

17:31.341 --> 17:33.343
About forty-five seconds.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.554
Yes! New personal best.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.973
[inhales] I've never felt so calm.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.183
What did I tell ya?

17:39.266 --> 17:41.852
I am radiating total peace.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.605
-[screaming in distance]
-I hear birds singing.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.357
I hear screaming...

17:48.025 --> 17:48.942
Wait, screaming?

17:49.026 --> 17:50.736
I think we lost the scorpi--

17:51.820 --> 17:53.572
[both screaming]

17:53.655 --> 17:54.615
I peed!

17:54.740 --> 17:56.325
[all screaming]

17:59.369 --> 18:00.370
[all continue screaming]

18:04.416 --> 18:06.877
[whistles] King Julien! What's wrong?

18:06.960 --> 18:09.838
[sobbing] Clover, you gotta save us!

18:09.922 --> 18:13.842
I was wrong about scorpions
being awesomer than you!

18:13.926 --> 18:16.386
Even though it was your fault
my jumping bean got stolen

18:16.470 --> 18:18.055
in the first place, just sayin'.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.473
Please help us!

18:19.556 --> 18:21.850
We all must remain calm.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.936
I've been working out my issues with Fred,

18:24.019 --> 18:27.272
and I have realized
all conflicts can be resolved

18:27.356 --> 18:29.733
without eating the fruit of anger.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.652
[shouting] I don't wanna remain calm!

18:31.735 --> 18:34.530
The scorpions have chased us
out of the village and taken over.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.531
That's it?

18:35.614 --> 18:38.325
Then we simply explain to them
that when they chase you

18:38.408 --> 18:40.702
out of the village, you don't feel seen.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.079
-[all squealing]
-[dance music playing]

18:44.748 --> 18:46.125
This is gonna be great.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.585
King Julien, I totally got your back.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.586
Don't worry.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.297
I'll connect with them
on a personal level and...

18:52.381 --> 18:54.383
Are those dudes in a hot tub?

18:55.759 --> 18:57.678
Hey, how is everybody?

18:57.761 --> 19:00.848
Yeah, Fred. Yeah, the giant one.

19:00.931 --> 19:01.849
That's me.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.225
Fred, what are you doing?

19:03.308 --> 19:04.560
You're supposed to be helping us.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.478
Yeah, calling an audible on that.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.356
This party's off the hook!
What's your name?

19:09.439 --> 19:11.775
-Jen? With two "N"s?
-[screeches]

19:11.859 --> 19:14.695
One "N"? I love that! I love one "N"!

19:14.778 --> 19:18.532
Jen, is it just me,
or are we totally vibing right now?

19:19.158 --> 19:20.993
Fred. You promised to help!

19:21.076 --> 19:22.452
Yeah, but I'm a scorpion.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.788
It's in our nature to be untrustworthy.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.666
There's, like, fables and stuff about it.

19:27.749 --> 19:30.627
Where are all the single scorpions at?

19:30.711 --> 19:32.379
Clover, do something.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.339
Oh, you want me to do--
Oh, like, you know,

19:34.423 --> 19:37.467
fly into a rage and personally remove

19:37.551 --> 19:39.428
each and every scorpion from the kingdom?

19:39.511 --> 19:40.512
Boom! Yes!

19:40.596 --> 19:42.681
The kingdom needs you! I'm sorry, okay?

19:42.764 --> 19:45.267
I was stupid to ever think
you could be replaced!

19:45.350 --> 19:47.269
Punch something! Please!

19:47.352 --> 19:49.104
Violence should only be a last resort.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.230
[screaming]

19:50.314 --> 19:53.984
Brothers and sisters,
that is quite enough.

19:54.067 --> 19:57.070
-[Julien shouting in pain]
-Let's just use our words, right?

19:57.154 --> 19:58.697
Clover! Save me!

19:58.780 --> 20:01.825
Or our hisses and clicks
or whatever it is that there...

20:01.909 --> 20:02.910
[gasps]

20:02.993 --> 20:04.328
[screaming] The horror! The horror!

20:04.453 --> 20:05.454
[growling]

20:06.371 --> 20:07.956
-That is quite enough!
-[grunts in pain]

20:08.040 --> 20:09.541
All right, peace is canceled!

20:09.666 --> 20:11.919
Unhand my king! Now!

20:12.002 --> 20:13.503
[grunting]

20:17.966 --> 20:19.301
[laughing manically]

20:24.264 --> 20:25.933
Hi-yah!

20:26.016 --> 20:27.226
[Fred] Hey!

20:27.309 --> 20:29.686
Those are my friends
and potential love interests

20:29.770 --> 20:31.355
you're pulverizing.

20:31.438 --> 20:36.568
I tried to be cool, [shouting]
but this is happening!

20:37.277 --> 20:38.862
-[all three exclaiming]
-[Fred shouting]

20:42.407 --> 20:45.244
Hey, Fred... it's in my nature...

20:46.203 --> 20:48.038
to mash your face in with punches.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.791
Not cool, Clover! Not cool!

20:51.166 --> 20:52.000
Hi-yah!

20:52.084 --> 20:53.126
Whoa!

20:56.296 --> 20:57.172
[nervously] Oh...

20:57.256 --> 20:59.007
[shouting and crashes]

20:59.841 --> 21:02.302
Hey, if you see Jen-with-one-N,

21:02.386 --> 21:05.138
ask her if we're still on
for coffee tomorrow.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.098
[groaning]

21:07.933 --> 21:09.101
[all three straining]

21:11.019 --> 21:13.397
I guess maybe
I should have listened to you.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.607
Don't let it go to your head but,

21:15.691 --> 21:19.111
I'd rather have you around
than a bunch of angry scorpions.

21:19.194 --> 21:22.239
I'll try to not to get too cocky,
Your Majesty.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.282
What's this?

21:23.991 --> 21:25.367
Aha! [laughing]

21:25.450 --> 21:26.451
[giggling]

21:26.535 --> 21:27.869
-[Julien] You guys!
-Ow!

21:27.953 --> 21:31.456
It's my beloved jumping bean! [laughing]

21:31.540 --> 21:32.541
[Clover and Maurice growling]

21:32.624 --> 21:33.792
Oh, right.

21:33.875 --> 21:37.087
I put him in the suitcase
so that I wouldn't lose him.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.880
So it was never stolen,

21:38.964 --> 21:41.967
and we almost lost the kingdom
'cause you forgot where you put it?

21:42.050 --> 21:43.927
[giggling]

21:45.595 --> 21:46.722
[growls]

21:46.805 --> 21:49.808
Om... Yah!

21:49.891 --> 21:51.893
[Mort] Whee, he, he, he!

21:51.977 --> 21:54.938
[exhales] Om...

21:56.982 --> 22:00.235
Hi, kids. Fred the Giant Scorpion here.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.279
Y'know, every week,
I get thousands of emails

22:02.362 --> 22:04.781
asking how I overcame my anger issues

22:04.865 --> 22:06.116
and stopped eating babies.

22:06.199 --> 22:08.410
But folks, I'm gonna level with you.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.704
I'm a work in progress, just like you.

22:12.247 --> 22:14.541
Hm... Uh... [stammering]

22:14.624 --> 22:19.254
Look, do I still have a slight urge
to eat those delicious-looking babies?

22:19.338 --> 22:20.505
Sure.

22:21.214 --> 22:22.090
But I'm not gonna.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.843
Even though that one on the left
looks very tender.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.011
[whimpering]

22:26.094 --> 22:28.847
Mm. Like a little poached quail egg.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.183
-Hold on. Wait. Don't leave yet--
-[all clamoring]

22:31.266 --> 22:33.393
Maybe I could just smell
their little baby heads.

22:33.477 --> 22:36.646
Where are you going?
I just want a bite. A nibble.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.107
[angrily] Give me those babies!

22:39.191 --> 22:40.984
[female lemur screaming] Ah! My baby!
