01:49.276 --> 01:52.403
Atlantic City was built for good times,

01:53.363 --> 01:56.365
so that folks could leave their cares behind.

01:57.576 --> 02:00.453
- See a show, dance on the pier...
- Would you like a flower?

02:00.704 --> 02:03.122
...build a castle in the sand.
- You can take two.

02:03.207 --> 02:06.083
Atlantic City was built to help people forget.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.545
But this day, Memorial Day,

02:11.173 --> 02:12.882
is for remembering.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.802
Tomorrow, we will once again

02:15.886 --> 02:17.887
be citizens of the world's playground.

02:18.806 --> 02:19.889
Today,

02:20.015 --> 02:23.226
we are proud simply to be Americans.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.357
I'd like to thank the members

02:29.441 --> 02:31.943
of our memorial committee here with us today,

02:32.236 --> 02:34.779
who worked tirelessly to make this monument possible.

02:35.823 --> 02:39.742
I'm sure they will convey our gratitude as well to Louis Kaestner,

02:40.911 --> 02:43.120
our own beloved Commodore.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.081
I know he would not miss this occasion

02:45.165 --> 02:48.125
were it not for pressing business elsewhere.

02:48.210 --> 02:52.129
He truly is this city's doting father.

02:53.048 --> 02:56.300
Thanks as well to the Attorney General of these United States,

02:56.385 --> 02:58.636
the distinguished Harry M. Daugherty,

02:58.762 --> 03:00.847
who joins us bearing the express good wishes

03:00.931 --> 03:02.265
of President Harding,

03:02.474 --> 03:05.685
himself attending the solemn observances

03:05.769 --> 03:08.771
this day at Arlington National Cemetery.

03:14.736 --> 03:19.115
And now, in reading the names of our city's fallen heroes,

03:19.283 --> 03:21.617
I feel it fitting to bestow that honor

03:22.494 --> 03:27.290
on a young man who can speak more directly to the ideals of sacrifice,

03:27.624 --> 03:30.793
service, and loyalty,

03:30.878 --> 03:33.087
more than I ever could.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.882
James Darmody, step up here.

03:36.675 --> 03:39.093
You didn't tell me you were going to speak.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.012
I wasn't.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.526
James Edison Darmody, ladies and gentlemen.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.322
You think I can't play this game?

03:59.406 --> 04:01.866
I don't think you even know the rules.

04:35.484 --> 04:39.236
Mr. Thompson just said some impressive things about me.

04:42.366 --> 04:43.824
But they're not true.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.243
I'm no one's idea of a hero,

04:46.453 --> 04:48.537
least of all mine.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.880
And when people ask me what I did over there,

04:58.048 --> 05:00.216
what I tell them is,

05:00.384 --> 05:02.218
"I made it back."

05:03.637 --> 05:08.557
We fought for the idea that democracy was worth saving.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.062
We fought for our mothers,

05:14.898 --> 05:16.649
for our sons,

05:18.860 --> 05:20.987
for our wives.

05:23.949 --> 05:26.242
We fought for America.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.870
I believe it was worth it.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.210
- Well said.
- Hear, hear.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.098
These are the names of brave men.

05:52.102 --> 05:55.438
John Archer Alberts,

05:58.150 --> 06:00.026
Frank Berry,

06:03.488 --> 06:05.823
John Collins,

06:07.951 --> 06:11.078
Lester Dayton.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.416
I knew Les.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.421
Andrew Furey,

06:22.215 --> 06:24.133
Joseph Grant,

06:26.011 --> 06:28.637
Robert Garner.

08:01.231 --> 08:04.692
Did you hear him up there? "Fought for democracy"?

08:04.860 --> 08:07.319
- What a load of bull.
- Who's this?

08:07.445 --> 08:09.613
The young vet at the ceremony this morning, Harry.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.408
- You know why he enlisted?
- These are getting tight.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.536
- They look fine.
- Because he couldn't hack it at Princeton.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.830
Talk about the "waist" in Washington, huh?

08:17.914 --> 08:18.956
Ho-ho!

08:19.040 --> 08:21.750
I jumped through hoops to get him in there, and he runs away?

08:21.835 --> 08:24.336
- Joins the Army? He's a patsy.
- Uh-huh?

08:24.421 --> 08:26.505
The world doesn't owe you anything. I don't care who you are.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.924
Nucky, Jess and I are only here for the day.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.760
We're addressing your legal problems tonight.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.845
And?

08:32.929 --> 08:35.764
It's a holiday. How about we just play some golf?

08:35.890 --> 08:37.850
Am I boring you, Harry?

08:38.894 --> 08:40.394
I think it's fair to say

08:40.477 --> 08:43.188
that I've gone out of my way on this, don't you?

08:43.273 --> 08:45.399
It's not the easiest deal to finesse.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.735
I've gone down the list of prosecutors, and this fella...

08:47.819 --> 08:49.528
Charles Kenneth Thorogood.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.405
He's someone you can work with.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.491
You actually enjoy golfing?

08:56.119 --> 08:58.495
I'd enjoy being a man with the time to play it.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.290
See you on the green.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.721
I hear you're acquainted with a Mr. George Remus.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.351
- I'm acquainted with a lot of people.
- I completely understand.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.978
It's just, I'm meeting him in Cincinnati on Wednesday.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.898
Would you consider him reliable in a business setting?

09:26.608 --> 09:28.692
I'd consider him a major bootlegger.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.486
That would be the business I'm talking about.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.614
Perhaps you could put in a word.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.491
Let him know I don't bite.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.348
You made a fine speech this morning. Quite moving.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.557
Very patriotic.

10:00.642 --> 10:04.728
We want people to know how proud this city is of the boys who went over there.

10:04.813 --> 10:05.771
Hear, hear.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.606
Nothing's cheaper than sentiment.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.609
I'm the only one in this room ever wore the blue.

10:10.735 --> 10:11.860
When was that, Mr. Parkhurst?

10:11.945 --> 10:14.113
Fort Kearny, Wyoming territory.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.948
He blew the trumpet for the Ninth.

10:16.032 --> 10:20.369
Thirty-two white men against 2,000 Sioux.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.247
We had the latest Springfields, and God damn me to hell

10:23.331 --> 10:28.168
if we didn't cut those painted bucks to red ribbons.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.879
- A slaughter.
- That's all it ever is, boy.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.257
You came out of the last one rather well though,

10:33.341 --> 10:34.341
didn't you, Jackson?

10:34.426 --> 10:37.303
I cleared a cool million selling chipped beef to the Army,

10:37.387 --> 10:38.804
and I don't care who knows it.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.724
Smart bet there, sir. Seize an opportunity.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.351
Chipped beef. I had it every day for five months.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.562
I'd rather eat dog turds.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.815
They paid me anyway.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.900
As you can see.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.695
Then you're a great man.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.907
What's all this horseshit anyway? We're here to discuss money.

11:00.035 --> 11:02.161
There's concern about the recent setbacks.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.079
We're not happy, Mr. Darmody.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.165
We took care of your little colored problem.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.624
Bought off the Coast Guard.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.543
We made a substantial investment with you.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.171
- With his father.
- And we've yet to see a dime.

11:13.882 --> 11:18.135
Every business has its kinks, but I assure you...

11:18.219 --> 11:21.638
You lost $70,000 of our money in that explosion.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.974
An entire warehouse full of alcohol.

11:24.059 --> 11:27.561
That's not a kink. That's a torpedo hitting the Lusitania.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.355
It's a matter of discretion, James.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.066
Discretion and return on capital.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.234
And you're going to get it. We'll make good.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.362
- It's just a matter of him and I...
- Too many people talking!

11:36.446 --> 11:38.364
We'd prefer to discuss this with the Commodore.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.866
- He's given me complete authority.
- I never heard that.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.159
Then you weren't paying attention!

11:42.243 --> 11:44.536
Is he dead? Or just dying?

11:45.455 --> 11:47.664
- My father is fine.
- Listen, son.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.625
You're trying to diddle the wrong men.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.628
Yeah? You gonna drum me out of your yacht club?

11:57.842 --> 12:00.677
It's high time you and your whole goddamned generation

12:00.804 --> 12:03.013
learned something about respect.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.484
You just taught me plenty.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.113
Gentlemen.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.832
- What the hell are you doing?
- Fuck these people!

12:29.916 --> 12:32.501
These people are financing the entire operation.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.461
- I'm done with them.
- Who said it was your decision?

12:35.171 --> 12:36.797
I don't see anyone else in charge.

12:37.340 --> 12:40.217
- I brought you in on this!
- Oh, you did? Thank you.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.470
Now stay the fuck out of my business.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.373
Thank you for the lift.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.987
What did they say about your father?

14:24.781 --> 14:26.907
They know something's wrong.

14:27.450 --> 14:30.619
And they questioned you, berated you.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.039
- And then Jackson...
- You know Parkhurst?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.584
- I know all of them, dear.
- How well?

14:42.090 --> 14:43.882
No one is allowed to do this to you.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.676
It's $70,000.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.553
That's nothing to men like that.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.638
Plus Horvitz in Philly?

14:50.515 --> 14:52.140
He keeps hocking me for his booze.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.644
You will not be disrespected, and you have to make that clear.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.897
- All right, Ma. - "All right, leave me alone"?

14:59.274 --> 15:02.442
Or, "All right, I understand what needs to be done"?

15:06.573 --> 15:07.823
Both.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.212
John D. Rockefeller was born on a farm.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.717
His father was a bigamist and a confidence man.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.803
His mother was a saint.

15:31.889 --> 15:35.684
Now he's worth $1 billion.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.982
And how is he spending his Memorial Day?

15:43.818 --> 15:46.278
He's not pumping oil.

18:20.975 --> 18:23.935
Go on now. Go!

18:25.521 --> 18:27.606
Hey! No, don't!

18:31.527 --> 18:33.612
Come on now.

18:33.696 --> 18:34.988
Good boy.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.532
Hey!

18:37.617 --> 18:39.075
I need that back!

18:40.870 --> 18:42.788
I need that mask!

19:02.558 --> 19:04.142
Look at this. I'm like a lobster.

19:04.227 --> 19:06.686
Chase a little ball around in the sun? Idiotic.

19:06.771 --> 19:07.938
Where is Owen?

19:08.940 --> 19:10.482
Dropping off Harry Daugherty. Why?

19:11.734 --> 19:12.901
Your brother's here.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.695
- In the conservatory.
- You let him in?

19:16.072 --> 19:17.572
What else could I do?

19:18.616 --> 19:20.408
It'll be fine.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.212
How many places have you lived in?

19:32.588 --> 19:34.172
Since you moved out of the house?

19:34.590 --> 19:36.967
Eight? Nine? What difference does it make?

19:37.426 --> 19:40.679
I had the upstairs apartment on Monroe,

19:41.305 --> 19:42.931
a little bungalow with June,

19:44.433 --> 19:46.351
and the place we got now.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.270
I was there for Christmas.

19:53.568 --> 19:55.819
The last time we spoke,

19:57.655 --> 19:59.739
- there was an offer made.
- The offer's gone.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.701
See? That's it.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.453
No conversation.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.664
Only orders.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.166
I'm your brother, Nucky.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.127
Then I love you.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.713
Now unless you have something to say,

20:14.797 --> 20:18.216
aside from the fact that God distributes his gifts unequally,

20:18.301 --> 20:20.927
this conversation is over.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.850
I know who's gonna testify against you.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.274
It doesn't matter.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.736
I just played golf with the Attorney General of the United States.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.280
- Think about what that means.
- You are one nasty prick.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.116
And you're a frightened little boy with no place else to go.

20:43.451 --> 20:46.202
So give me something else, and we can talk.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.330
Give me something else,

20:48.414 --> 20:50.123
and I'll know you're my brother.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.132
The Commodore is out of the game.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.135
He's had a stroke.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.596
They're trying to keep it under wraps.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.807
- Who are "they"?
- The kid and his mother.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.353
They're in over their heads, Nuck.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.022
They can't see past their own...

21:14.106 --> 21:16.483
- Resentment?
- She's batty.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.235
I mean, I don't blame her.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.863
But that whole situation?

21:22.198 --> 21:24.115
- It was never right.
- And that was my fault?

21:24.200 --> 21:27.243
Of course not. You did what you had to do.

21:27.328 --> 21:30.205
Taking care of me, Pop.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.415
- I know that.
- And Mabel.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.834
Yeah. Poor Mabel.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.592
I made a mistake, Nuck.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.846
I admit it.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.683
I don't know what to say.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.978
I don't know what to fucking do.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.984
Here I am.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.457
All right.

22:15.418 --> 22:16.501
We'll sort it out.

22:19.422 --> 22:21.339
But there is something I have to ask of you.

22:21.424 --> 22:22.549
Anything, Nuck.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.555
I need you to get on your knees.

22:30.349 --> 22:34.519
Bend down to the ground and kiss my fucking shoes, you piece of shit.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.770
What?

22:42.111 --> 22:43.236
You come crawling back here

22:43.320 --> 22:46.156
because you don't have the balls to finish what you started.

22:46.532 --> 22:49.159
Fuck that little cocksucker you call a partner.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.036
Fuck his conniving cunt of a mother.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.539
Fuck that old man. I'll see his corpse in a ditch.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.042
And fuck you, Brother!

24:01.190 --> 24:03.024
Enough.

24:12.827 --> 24:14.953
Get out of this house.

24:15.037 --> 24:17.413
- Pop...
- I don't give a fuck.

24:46.569 --> 24:50.238
In the future, if you're going to point a gun at someone,

24:51.198 --> 24:53.908
make sure it's loaded.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.832
Is this to be our life?

25:12.761 --> 25:13.845
Hey.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.517
Don't be hiding there.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.777
No, no, come on now.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.863
This way.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.967
- Hush yourself!
- Don't hit him.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.220
He's quiet now.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.097
Banging around an awful lot out there.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.184
- Bad for the varmints.
- I'm sorry.

26:09.777 --> 26:12.487
Sit on down now before you chase them all off.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.544
Go on now, give it to him.

26:55.197 --> 26:58.199
- That itch?
- Sometimes.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.702
I don't half doubt it.

27:02.913 --> 27:05.456
- Tree rat?
- He means squirrel.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.542
No, thank you.

27:11.005 --> 27:12.255
You a revenue agent?

27:16.844 --> 27:18.386
Then here.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.869
- Very strong.
- Made it myself.

27:42.953 --> 27:44.746
Have some more.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.835
Now I'm Glenmore. This is Pete.

27:50.961 --> 27:52.503
Richard Harrow.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.589
Where are you from, Richard?

27:55.215 --> 27:57.216
I live in Atlantic City.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.260
That's a sight to see, I'm told.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.596
You've never been?

28:01.847 --> 28:04.140
It must be 30 miles.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.767
I was once.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.435
Saw a flying horse.

28:08.437 --> 28:11.856
- That was some kind of trick.
- Well, it looked real to me.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.192
You're an easily bamboozled individual.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.694
Oh, lay off your pontificating.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.537
What brings you out here, Richard?

28:30.334 --> 28:32.668
I was hunting.

28:36.131 --> 28:39.092
I left my things by a pond.

28:39.635 --> 28:42.220
- Which pond now?
- I'm not sure.

28:42.304 --> 28:44.597
That's how one mistake leads to another.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.902
Well, we're gonna eat something.

28:58.654 --> 29:00.571
You probably should, too.

29:03.826 --> 29:05.660
Here's to flying horses.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.252
Sorry to keep you boys waiting.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.046
Been crawling through the underbrush?

29:17.840 --> 29:19.173
Too much sun this morning.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.217
Say hello to your new prosecutor.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.762
- You must be Charles.
- Call me Chip, Mr. Thompson.

29:25.472 --> 29:26.597
Chip.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.599
Harry tells me you're a man I can count on.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.059
I'd certainly like to think so.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.228
So you've talked?

29:32.312 --> 29:35.314
Mr. Thorogood and I have begun a discussion.

29:35.399 --> 29:37.733
He's fairly new to the courtroom.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.402
I hope that's not going be an issue.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.237
Only if you don't know where the judge sits.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.864
He's the one in the robe, right?

29:43.657 --> 29:46.659
- Very droll.
- I need to know how this will work.

29:46.743 --> 29:51.456
The U.S. Attorney here presents a motion to transfer to federal court.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.958
Under the argument that the election-rigging charges

29:54.042 --> 29:55.793
and the Mann Act violation

29:55.878 --> 30:00.465
constitute an ongoing criminal enterprise operating across state lines.

30:00.549 --> 30:04.051
And thus within the purview of the Third Circuit.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.470
What happens then?

30:05.554 --> 30:07.096
We go before our judge.

30:07.181 --> 30:10.183
He buys the humble wares which we set before him,

30:10.267 --> 30:11.601
and then Mr. Thorogood

30:11.977 --> 30:16.397
brings all of his legal acumen and youthful energy to bear.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.899
Fortunately for us...

30:17.983 --> 30:21.194
The Department of Justice determines it's simply not worth the time and resources

30:21.278 --> 30:23.821
to prosecute your case, which is dropped.

30:23.906 --> 30:26.365
We're swamped with Volstead as it is.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.246
Ah.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.542
- You're not saying thank you.
- I need a guarantee.

30:36.627 --> 30:38.753
You're not gonna get one.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.383
Just remember, this was your idea.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.178
All right.

30:47.429 --> 30:48.429
Ah.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.223
I have an early train.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.141
Sorry to hear it.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.940
We're free all evening.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.408
What should I do with the bones?

31:10.285 --> 31:13.412
Don't give them to him. He'll choke.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.688
What's his name?

31:39.898 --> 31:41.148
He's not mine.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.776
- He just comes around.
- He knows who he is.

31:44.194 --> 31:46.904
He's an old soldier who just keeps on fighting.

31:46.989 --> 31:48.322
Don't you, boy?

31:50.492 --> 31:52.410
For what?

31:52.494 --> 31:54.036
What's that?

31:54.121 --> 31:56.372
What does he fight for?

31:56.999 --> 31:58.332
You're gonna have to ask him.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.342
Now what's your pleasure, Glenmore?

32:08.677 --> 32:10.803
I'm of a mind to sleep out tonight.

32:10.887 --> 32:13.014
I'm going home, I guess.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.515
You're getting soft.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.770
What about you, Richard?

32:20.731 --> 32:23.024
I should get back to town.

32:23.984 --> 32:25.985
How you aim to do that?

32:27.029 --> 32:28.487
I don't know.

32:28.739 --> 32:32.617
I got the Ford parked not a hundred yards away.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.165
Say, Richard.

32:41.543 --> 32:43.461
I'm out in these woods a lot.

32:43.545 --> 32:47.381
People come out here, they get up to all kinds of foolishness.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.178
That's not what these woods is for.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.432
You understand me?

32:59.978 --> 33:02.605
These woods is for hunting and fishing,

33:02.814 --> 33:05.274
seeing what the birds get up to.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.155
These woods are for living.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.825
Understand me there?

33:19.289 --> 33:20.456
Yes.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.917
All right then.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.386
You can fix it, right?

33:33.553 --> 33:36.430
Your old pop can fix anything.

33:47.109 --> 33:49.527
Does your throat still hurt?

33:50.612 --> 33:52.571
This medicine helps.

33:55.242 --> 33:58.577
- I'm not eating, June.
- Eli, it's George. Can I talk to you?

34:04.376 --> 34:06.043
- Ho there, Patrick.
- I'm Brian.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.795
Sure, okay.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.179
You know what we need for this, Bri?

34:19.141 --> 34:20.725
A veeblefetzer.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.310
The left-handed kind.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.146
Do we have one?

34:25.230 --> 34:26.230
Mmm-mmm.

34:27.357 --> 34:30.234
Mr. Dean across the street, tell him I asked.

34:30.819 --> 34:31.819
Scoot.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.706
We're alone, right?

34:47.043 --> 34:49.003
- What's it look like?
- I don't know.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.545
You got a lot of kids.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.966
I don't store them in the garage.

34:57.512 --> 35:00.431
There's a rumor going around.

35:01.057 --> 35:03.768
The Commodore... You know?

35:08.064 --> 35:11.525
- I don't know.
- That he... Apoplexy.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.487
He's like a log or something. He can't even take a piss by himself.

35:14.571 --> 35:15.613
Not true, George.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.699
I saw him this morning. We had breakfast.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.119
Eggs, bacon.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.163
The man loves his bacon.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.707
It's all on track.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.626
Maybe we should go over there.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.295
- Bother him at this hour?
- Just to be sure.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.047
I mean, after you had breakfast, you never know.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.800
- I'm with the kid now, George.
- Right.

35:37.052 --> 35:39.011
- So I'll go over.
- Are you listening to what I'm saying?

35:39.095 --> 35:40.221
I heard,

35:40.305 --> 35:42.640
but think it through. If the Commodore's not...

35:42.724 --> 35:45.935
- I just told you...
- If he can't protect us from your brother,

35:46.019 --> 35:49.730
I have to say it, we're all in a very exposed...

35:50.607 --> 35:52.942
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

35:53.151 --> 35:54.693
You're moving towards me.

35:55.403 --> 35:58.405
- All I want you to do is take a second...
- It's true, isn't it?

35:58.490 --> 36:00.908
- Absolutely not.
- Jesus!

36:02.702 --> 36:04.078
It is true.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.748
So now it's what, you and Jimmy?

36:08.083 --> 36:10.167
This was the plan? Son of a bitch.

36:10.252 --> 36:12.336
- Okay, George...
- Hey, let go of me.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.213
- I'm not gonna do anything.
- Then let go. Let go!

36:14.297 --> 36:16.465
- Look, keep it down, my family...
- That's it. I'm out.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.300
- I want out.
- Look, all I'm asking for...

36:18.385 --> 36:20.845
Let go! If you don't let go, there's gonna be trouble.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.012
- George...
- I'm saying it now.

36:22.097 --> 36:23.722
I'll go straight to Nucky, I will.

36:23.807 --> 36:26.225
- I'll tell the world...
- George, shut the fuck up!

36:39.447 --> 36:42.575
Fuck. Fuck!

37:13.857 --> 37:15.399
Yeah.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.443
All right.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.987
Okay, okay.

37:22.282 --> 37:24.283
Dad! Dad!

37:26.328 --> 37:28.704
- He doesn't have one.
- Huh?

37:28.830 --> 37:31.624
The thing you asked for, he never heard of it.

37:33.335 --> 37:34.335
Uh...

37:35.587 --> 37:37.129
So...

37:37.213 --> 37:38.756
You need to go back to the house.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.302
My throat.

37:43.386 --> 37:45.888
I don't want you catching this.

37:57.651 --> 37:59.985
How's your head feeling?

38:02.197 --> 38:05.032
Like I won another round with that car door.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.160
You need to pay more attention.

38:08.995 --> 38:11.372
That's why it's called an accident, Ange.

38:19.881 --> 38:22.216
The things you said at the ceremony,

38:22.717 --> 38:24.176
did you mean them?

38:29.432 --> 38:31.225
I'm here.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.268
With you.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.480
Our son's asleep in his bed.

38:36.690 --> 38:39.149
Nobody's hungry.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.069
Nobody's scared.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.116
What else is there?

38:48.660 --> 38:51.412
There's gotta be something.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.165
Hasn't there?

39:12.684 --> 39:14.560
Is there a reason not to answer it?

39:17.230 --> 39:18.856
I don't think so.

39:35.331 --> 39:38.584
Richard. We missed you this morning.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.171
The dedication for the memorial.

39:42.505 --> 39:45.007
I wasn't interested in that.

39:49.429 --> 39:50.471
You all right?

39:51.765 --> 39:54.141
I should talk to Jimmy.

40:01.316 --> 40:03.484
We're okay, Ange.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.479
Where were you today?

40:41.022 --> 40:43.148
I needed to take a walk.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.071
I should've gone with you.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.031
We're both back now.

40:52.909 --> 40:54.576
Are you up for a job tonight?

41:02.377 --> 41:04.378
Is there a problem, Richard?

41:07.674 --> 41:10.634
Would you fight for me?

41:24.440 --> 41:25.899
Of course I would.

41:28.653 --> 41:31.321
Right down to the last bullet.

41:42.208 --> 41:44.793
Then let's go to work.

42:53.404 --> 42:54.613
Mr. Parkhurst?

42:54.697 --> 42:56.615
Would you like your cocoa in here this evening?

42:56.699 --> 42:59.034
Upstairs as usual.

42:59.118 --> 43:01.203
- Half an hour.
- Yes, sir.

43:01.287 --> 43:03.997
You know what this is, Alexander?

43:04.415 --> 43:07.626
A Sioux Indian breechcloth.

43:08.294 --> 43:10.712
I've been hunting one down for years.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.464
It doesn't cover much, does it?

43:13.091 --> 43:15.842
They come charging at you practically bare-assed,

43:17.136 --> 43:18.720
waving one of those clubs.

43:20.181 --> 43:24.184
Thought they could stop bullets with magic.

43:25.228 --> 43:26.478
Foolish.

43:27.563 --> 43:30.023
Fine beadwork though!

43:30.108 --> 43:33.902
- Yes, sir.
- Damn fool savages.

43:34.320 --> 43:37.197
Fetch you in 30 minutes, Mr. Parkhurst.

43:44.455 --> 43:47.291
Alexander, on second thought, I will have the cocoa.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.584
What...

43:49.711 --> 43:52.379
What is... Oh!

43:53.047 --> 43:56.258
- What...
- I'm gonna teach you something now.

43:59.137 --> 44:01.471
- Who the hell are you?
- A soldier.

44:01.556 --> 44:02.848
No!

44:49.771 --> 44:52.314
- Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!
- Sorry, ma'am.

44:53.775 --> 44:55.359
Did you hear something, too?

44:55.735 --> 44:56.818
What do you mean?

44:57.111 --> 44:58.612
Someone screaming.

44:58.988 --> 45:01.990
No. I heard you, out here.

45:03.409 --> 45:05.535
Is something wrong?

45:05.620 --> 45:07.871
The children are fine. I...

45:08.164 --> 45:10.082
I just felt...

45:11.793 --> 45:13.710
It's been a strange day.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.380
You should get back to bed.

45:16.839 --> 45:18.882
Good night, ma'am.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.152
Lady of the manor?

45:39.612 --> 45:42.989
- Keep your voice down.
- It wasn't me who screamed.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.409
I couldn't help it.

45:45.493 --> 45:48.161
I'll not do it again, if that's what you'd prefer.

45:48.538 --> 45:52.165
Out there snooping around. Probably thinks I'm pinching the silverware.

45:52.291 --> 45:54.084
I should, too, what she pays me.

45:54.168 --> 45:56.670
- Tight with a pound, is she?
- That's just the tip of it.

45:57.004 --> 45:59.589
She made me call her family in New York,

45:59.674 --> 46:01.633
and they didn't want anything to do with her.

46:02.844 --> 46:04.678
Hard luck.

46:05.888 --> 46:08.473
You shouldn't be in my room at this hour.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.726
I shouldn't be in your room at all.

46:11.811 --> 46:14.729
But what's the sense in doing something half-wrong?

46:26.784 --> 46:29.453
Please don't get me into trouble.

46:29.537 --> 46:31.538
I'd never dare.

46:49.891 --> 46:51.725
I can't see anything, Eli.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.643
What is it you need to see?

46:53.728 --> 46:55.770
Whatever it is I'm doing.

46:57.273 --> 46:58.899
Jesus!

46:59.275 --> 47:00.734
Is it somebody I know?

47:01.027 --> 47:04.321
- It's Mary Pickford.
- You killed Mary Pickford?

47:04.405 --> 47:06.740
Help me get this in the car, then you can go.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.304
- Eddie, right?
- Yeah.

47:29.388 --> 47:32.057
Could you go find us some cold champagne

47:32.141 --> 47:35.560
and some ice water and some oysters?

47:35.853 --> 47:37.896
Big ones.

47:43.027 --> 47:44.945
Shut the door, Counselor.

47:45.305 --> 47:51.282
