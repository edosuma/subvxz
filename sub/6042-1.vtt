00:27.095 --> 00:30.297
(Whimsical score
playing)

04:42.582 --> 04:44.952
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:50.590 --> 04:53.427
- Here's a menu.
- Thank you.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.563
I'll be right back
with you.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.888
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?

05:54.922 --> 05:56.890
I don't mean to bother you.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.591
What?

05:58.626 --> 05:59.927
I feel I know you
from somewhere.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.561
Really?

06:01.595 --> 06:03.396
Yeah, did you go to
San mateo high school?

06:03.431 --> 06:05.699
- Yeah, how'd you know that?
- I went there too.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.901
- So are you from here?
- Not really.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.605
My mother lives up here
but I'm from San Francisco.

06:11.638 --> 06:12.805
What about you?

06:12.840 --> 06:15.709
San Jose.
I remember you now.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.644
You were in
my English class.

06:17.678 --> 06:20.780
- I was?
- Yeah, I sat two seats
behind you.

06:20.813 --> 06:23.917
- You remember that far?
- Yeah.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.853
So what do you do?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.522
I'm a fashion model.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.625
And a beautiful one too.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.960
Thanks.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.530
Well, it was nice
talking to you,

06:36.564 --> 06:37.797
But I should
really get going.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.700
I've got an audition
for a modeling job.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.702
So it was good
talking to you.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.572
Same here.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.218
Nathalie.

06:59.251 --> 07:02.222
Oh, hi again.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.758
I was wondering if we
can keep in contact.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.694
Sure.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.563
Here's my card.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.833
- Here's mine.
- Again.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.668
Again, it was nice
talking to you.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.738
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.848
This morning flocks
of seagulls and crows

07:28.881 --> 07:31.584
Were found dead
in downtown San Jose

07:31.619 --> 07:33.587
And along highway 101.

07:33.621 --> 07:36.789
The crows and seagulls
also caused an accident

07:36.823 --> 07:40.093
On highway 101
near the 1st street exit.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.597
Authorities are investigating
the cause of their death.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.999
In other news today,
the population

07:46.033 --> 07:48.602
Of polar bears
is declining rapidly

07:48.636 --> 07:51.270
Due to the melting
of sea ice in the arctic.

07:51.303 --> 07:53.607
As the sea ice melts,
the polar bears

07:53.641 --> 07:54.907
Are forced to move
farther north.

07:54.941 --> 07:59.012
Although some have survived,
many have died from starvation

07:59.046 --> 08:03.116
Due to the difficulty of finding
enough food such as seals.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.191
(Car alarm beeps)

10:46.078 --> 10:48.215
What does it take
to win your business today?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.150
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.253
Okay, I'll give you that
and a 50% discount.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.922
Can we close
the deal today?

10:56.289 --> 10:57.825
Can I place
your order today?

10:57.858 --> 11:00.227
Great, thanks.
We appreciate your business.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.696
Whoo-hoo!

11:05.298 --> 11:08.467
Hey, what's with
all the noise?

11:08.501 --> 11:11.004
Caught the big fish.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.006
Yeah?
How big was the sale?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.908
$1 million.

11:14.941 --> 11:17.978
- Awesome, man.
- Biggest sale of my career.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.913
I'm proud of you.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.379
(Cell phone ringing)

12:30.883 --> 12:32.151
Nathalie?

12:32.184 --> 12:33.286
Hey, Christine.
What's up?

12:33.320 --> 12:35.823
I have great news for you.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.858
Victoria's secret
wants you

12:37.891 --> 12:39.927
To become their
cover girl model.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.361
You're kidding.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.932
No no,
it's the real deal.

12:44.965 --> 12:48.000
That's great.
Yeah, of course I'll do it.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.235
Thanks for getting
me the gig.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.872
You are welcome.

12:51.905 --> 12:55.107
You worked very hard.
So here's your chance
to impress them.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.878
Congratulations again.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.280
Okay. All right.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.582
Okay, I'll talk
to you later.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.384
Thank you again.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.120
All right.
Okay, bye, Christine.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.856
Thanks.
Okay.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.295
(Cell phone rings)

13:51.197 --> 13:54.101
- Hello?
- Nathalie?

13:54.133 --> 13:55.267
Who is this?

13:55.301 --> 13:58.170
It's rod.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.306
Oh, the guy
from the restaurant.
What's up?

14:00.340 --> 14:04.276
Hey, it was nice running
into you at half moon bay.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.145
Yeah, it was nice
meeting you.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.916
So how's your day?

14:10.217 --> 14:12.152
It's going well.
How's yours?

14:12.185 --> 14:15.255
Great.
I made a big sale today.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.990
Good.
Fantastic.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.227
Thanks.

14:20.259 --> 14:22.963
I closed a big job
offer today

14:22.995 --> 14:24.130
With Victoria's secret,

14:24.164 --> 14:26.999
Wow, congratulations.

14:27.034 --> 14:30.002
I think you'll look great
in those lingerie.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.303
Thanks.

14:33.305 --> 14:36.409
So how about dinner
to celebrate your success?

14:36.443 --> 14:39.446
- That was fast.
- I know a good vietnamese
restaurant.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.314
Sounds delicious.
I'll see you then.

14:49.255 --> 14:50.657
Yes.

14:51.723 --> 14:53.593
Yes.

15:11.043 --> 15:12.611
Man, all air.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.250
Whoo.
This heat's killing me.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.220
I know, man.
What's with this weather?

15:20.252 --> 15:21.955
A heat wave in winter?

15:21.989 --> 15:25.357
I don't know.
Let's call it a day.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.240
I met this girl nathalie
over the weekend.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.275
Good for you.
Is she hot?

15:43.309 --> 15:46.378
- Yeah. Fashion model.
- Lucky you, man.

15:46.412 --> 15:48.314
Yeah, we're going out
this weekend.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.182
Hope you score
with her, man.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.318
Is that all you ever
think about... is sex?

15:53.785 --> 15:55.455
Anyways, we're just
gonna go to lunch.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.389
Just talk.
Get to know each other.

15:57.423 --> 15:59.993
A day without sex

16:00.027 --> 16:02.028
Is a day wasted, man.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.330
I'll let you know
how it goes.

16:03.362 --> 16:07.300
Anyways, I heard n.C.T.
Is going to be acquired
by oracle.

16:07.334 --> 16:10.502
- Really?
I hope that's true, man.
- I know it's true.

16:10.537 --> 16:14.441
You know, if that happens,
we'll all be millionaires.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.344
Yeah.

16:17.376 --> 16:20.780
There was a wildfire today
in the Santa Cruz mountains.

16:20.812 --> 16:23.350
Dubbed the St. Martin
wildfire,

16:23.382 --> 16:26.586
It has already burned through
30,000 acres of trees

16:26.618 --> 16:29.089
And has destroyed
over 100 homes.

16:29.121 --> 16:33.093
Currently there is 0%
containment of this fire.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.095
However, firefighters
are hopeful

16:35.128 --> 16:38.065
That within the coming days
the weather will become
more favorable

16:38.098 --> 16:41.101
And help to extinguish
the St. Martin wildfire.

16:41.134 --> 16:45.404
In other news, the first
green grand prix event

16:45.437 --> 16:47.439
Was announced today
in San Francisco.

16:47.473 --> 16:50.309
All cars for this racing
event will be powered

16:50.342 --> 16:53.113
With hybrid or electric
technologies.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.614
Parts of the streets
of San Francisco

16:54.647 --> 16:56.482
Will be used
as the racing course

16:56.516 --> 17:00.087
And the drivers will be
Hollywood celebrities.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.191
(Doorbell rings)

17:07.859 --> 17:09.829
Hi, my name
is Jerry Owens.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.563
I'm from solar power
accessories.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.165
We have
an appointment today.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.166
Oh, yeah yeah.
Come on in.

17:17.868 --> 17:20.372
Here's that estimate
I was telling you about.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.413
Wow, $20,000 for
a 3 kilowatt solar panel?

17:26.444 --> 17:28.214
Yes.

17:28.247 --> 17:29.582
Where are you
gonna put it?

17:29.616 --> 17:31.450
Come and I'll show you.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.272
And that, sir,
is where we're going to
install your solar panel.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.278
Okay.
Huh.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.379
$20,000, huh?

18:00.412 --> 18:02.882
Is there any way
we can lower the price?

18:02.915 --> 18:06.318
For you, sir,
I'll knock off $1,000.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.488
- $1,000, huh?
- Yeah.

18:10.289 --> 18:12.524
- Okay, let's do it.
- All right.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.347
Hi, nathalie.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.549
Hi.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.219
Hi.
This is for you.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.420
Thanks.
That's sweet.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.156
- You ready?
- Yeah.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.158
(No audible dialogue)

19:24.630 --> 19:26.766
So why did you decide
to go into sales?

19:26.798 --> 19:30.502
I like sales.
It fits my personality.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.739
I started out
as a software engineer,

19:32.772 --> 19:35.242
A b.S. In computer science.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.278
Software development
was boring for me.

19:38.311 --> 19:41.381
And I felt I was more of
a sales and marketing type.

19:41.413 --> 19:44.550
So I switched to
a high-tech sales career.

19:44.583 --> 19:45.718
That's interesting.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.688
Some of my friends say
that my b.S. Degree

19:48.721 --> 19:51.724
Stands for bullshit because
I was too much of a salesman

19:51.758 --> 19:53.525
And not enough engineer.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.328
Very funny.

19:55.362 --> 19:59.531
I work at a start-up company
called n.C.T. Software.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.200
Got the stock option.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.404
Hopefully if the company
makes it big

20:04.437 --> 20:06.406
By being bought out
or goes public,

20:06.438 --> 20:08.608
I'll exercise
that stock option,

20:08.640 --> 20:11.410
Cash out and walk away
with tons of cash.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.644
My silicon valley dream.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.646
I hope that happens
for you.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.648
Thanks.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.651
Tell me about modeling.
What do you like about it?

20:19.685 --> 20:23.290
I love it.
It's fun and glamorous,

20:23.323 --> 20:24.656
But hard work.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.358
My mother
doesn't see that though.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.427
She wants me to be
a real estate agent.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.462
It's not for me though.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.031
Do what you like, nathalie.
Follow your dream.

20:32.063 --> 20:34.401
I have every intention.

20:34.434 --> 20:37.304
So how come you never made
a pass at me in school?

20:37.337 --> 20:40.706
I should have.
I was too shy.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.708
Why don't you make
a pass at me now?

20:42.742 --> 20:45.577
I thought I already had.

20:45.611 --> 20:49.382
So what's your plan?
Family? Kids?

20:49.416 --> 20:51.284
Whoa, now this is
getting serious.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.352
I'm just curious.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.588
I'd probably settle down
if I met the right lady.

20:56.622 --> 20:59.392
- Hope you do.
- So do i.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.260
So who's the right lady?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.863
She's beautiful,

21:03.896 --> 21:05.864
Kind, compassionate,

21:05.898 --> 21:08.601
Honest and loyal.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.536
- Is that all?
- Yup.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.072
How about a nice figure?
Sexy?

21:13.105 --> 21:15.374
That would certainly help.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.476
What do you like
to do for fun?

21:17.510 --> 21:20.712
Watch football,
especially the 49ers.

21:20.746 --> 21:23.482
Also a part-time
eagles fan.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.353
And a little exercise...
Tennis.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.455
How about you?

21:28.487 --> 21:30.622
I like to go to the movies.

21:30.657 --> 21:33.659
And I like to hang around
with my best friends

21:33.692 --> 21:35.727
And go dancing at the clubs...
Clubbing.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.498
And I like to
spend time with Alex.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.500
Alex?

21:40.532 --> 21:43.503
He's really cute.

21:43.535 --> 21:45.704
Who is Alex?

21:45.737 --> 21:48.408
And I love him to death.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.510
Come on, let me
see the picture.
Is he your boyfriend?

21:50.542 --> 21:52.412
I can't wait
for you to meet him.

21:52.445 --> 21:53.645
Come on, let me see it.

21:53.679 --> 21:56.383
Come on,
let me see it.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.419
All right.
Meet Alex.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.119
You're right.
He is cute.

22:01.152 --> 22:03.423
- So you're a cats lover.
- Yes.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.658
If I could afford it,
I'd have at least 10 of them.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.528
- Wow, a cat zoo?
- Yup.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.929
You've got to be kidding.

22:10.962 --> 22:12.399
Nope.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.510
(Birds chirping)

23:13.860 --> 23:15.728
Beautiful, kind,

23:15.762 --> 23:18.197
Compassionate
and intelligent...

23:18.229 --> 23:21.032
- I hope you find her.
- I will.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.782
- That was fun.
- We should do it again.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.483
I'd like to.

24:14.085 --> 24:15.654
Good night.
See you next week.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.557
Can't I come in?

24:17.589 --> 24:20.527
Not on the first date.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.994
I'm not that kind of girl.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.095
Okay.

24:27.534 --> 24:28.867
Good night.

24:47.853 --> 24:50.056
- Hi, mom.
- Oh hi, honey.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.823
- How are you?
- Oh, good.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.925
I'm just fixing some lunch.
You want to stay?

24:53.959 --> 24:55.794
I've actually
got to run soon.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.929
But I needed to
pop in and see you.

24:57.963 --> 24:59.699
I'm glad you did.

24:59.731 --> 25:02.869
What's that smile
all about?

25:04.837 --> 25:06.972
I don't know what
you're talking about, mom.

25:07.006 --> 25:10.542
Oh, come on.
I see it all over your face.

25:10.577 --> 25:13.779
Well, I did meet a guy.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.815
You're kidding.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.550
He is great, mom.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.018
You know we went
to the same high school?

25:19.051 --> 25:21.320
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

25:21.352 --> 25:24.757
We had lunch over the weekend
and it was terrific, mom.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.058
I mean, we hit it off
right away.

25:26.092 --> 25:27.993
He's smart
and he's ambitious.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.897
And he's interested
in what I have to say

25:30.929 --> 25:34.866
Instead of trying to get
something from me.
So he's great.

25:34.900 --> 25:38.003
Oh, that's fantastic.
Now what does he do
for a living?

25:38.037 --> 25:39.739
He's a software salesman.

25:39.771 --> 25:42.774
Oh listen, invite him
over for dinner.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.342
I'd love to meet him.

25:44.375 --> 25:46.813
Maybe in time, mom,
when we get better acquainted.

25:46.845 --> 25:49.115
Well, I can understand that.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.584
You know, look,
keep me...

25:51.618 --> 25:54.654
You know, keep me informed
along the way.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.988
- All right.
- How's modeling going?

25:57.022 --> 25:59.858
It's great, mom.
I got a job with
Victoria's secret.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.560
- (Gasps) No way!
- Yeah.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.830
Are you serious?
Oh my gosh.

26:04.863 --> 26:08.366
Oh, honey, you know
I've always been supportive
of your modeling career.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.137
It's just such
a tough business to be in.

26:11.169 --> 26:14.373
It is.
Thank you, mom.
I'm well on my way.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.876
Well, listen.
If things don't work out,

26:16.909 --> 26:21.147
It doesn't hurt to have
a secure financial husband

26:21.180 --> 26:23.014
To support you.

26:23.048 --> 26:26.017
Or, you know, a real estate
career to fall back on.

26:26.051 --> 26:27.986
Okay, mom.
Thanks.

26:28.019 --> 26:30.021
You told me about
a dozen times already.

26:30.055 --> 26:32.158
You know I always
love your advice.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.925
Actually, I've got
to get going.

26:33.959 --> 26:35.927
I just wanted to drop by
and say hi to you

26:35.961 --> 26:38.063
And to tell you
all about my new gig.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.931
Well, does the gig
pay well?

26:39.965 --> 26:43.001
- Yes, it does.
- Ooh, that's my girl.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.994
(Cell phone ringing)

27:08.027 --> 27:09.962
I need to get the phone.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.802
Hello?

27:16.835 --> 27:18.170
Hey, mai.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.071
Yeah?

27:20.105 --> 27:22.107
It's nathalie.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.676
Oh, hi.

27:23.710 --> 27:24.811
What are you doing?

27:24.843 --> 27:27.013
What does it sound
like I'm doing?

27:27.045 --> 27:29.749
Rick is here
in bed with me.

27:29.781 --> 27:31.751
Sorry to interrupt.

27:31.783 --> 27:35.688
Listen, do you want to go
on a double date with me?

27:35.722 --> 27:37.889
I don't know.
Why?

27:37.924 --> 27:39.958
I just met this guy rod

27:39.991 --> 27:42.695
And he's terrific.

27:42.729 --> 27:45.096
Sounds fun.
I'll let Rick know.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.166
Great.
I'll set it up.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.739
Want to go on
a double date with me?

27:52.772 --> 27:54.105
Why not?

27:54.139 --> 27:57.976
My friend nathalie
just met someone named rod.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.478
You remember,
the fashion model?

28:00.511 --> 28:01.680
Oh yeah.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.282
With rod?

28:03.315 --> 28:05.718
My buddy rod.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.720
He was telling me
last week

28:07.754 --> 28:09.721
He met a fashion model
named nathalie.

28:09.756 --> 28:11.157
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.926
Man, this is gonna be fun.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.266
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:20.299 --> 28:22.201
Please help me give
a warm welcome

28:22.234 --> 28:24.402
For our c.E.O.
Bill star.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.775
Thank you.
Good morning.

28:28.808 --> 28:31.811
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have some great news.

28:31.843 --> 28:34.747
Our board of directors has
agreed to the acquisition

28:34.781 --> 28:37.182
Of n.C.T. Software
by oracle corporation

28:37.216 --> 28:39.150
For $1 billion.

28:39.184 --> 28:41.220
(Cheering)

28:41.253 --> 28:43.389
A billion.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.760
A billion.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.903
You guys...
You guys have worked hard

28:56.936 --> 28:59.872
And you've all earned
your stock option.
Congratulations.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.808
You you you you and you.

29:29.968 --> 29:32.504
So I guess the meeting's
adjourned.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.944
Congratulations.
Good work.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.077
You bet.
You bet.

29:39.110 --> 29:41.848
- Congratulations.
- Way to go, bill.

29:41.881 --> 29:44.283
The negotiating man.
Oh yeah!

29:44.316 --> 29:48.821
- Thank you so much.
- What are you getting
with your money?

29:48.855 --> 29:51.156
(Overlapping conversations)

29:58.064 --> 30:00.833
So now you've got
a big payday with your
big stock option, huh?

30:00.867 --> 30:03.835
Yeah, I earned it.
All those big deals
I did with n.C.T.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.838
And millions of dollars
in revenue and sales.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.007
Well, you've done
a great job, rod.

30:08.039 --> 30:10.075
And we appreciate
your contribution.
Thank you.

30:10.109 --> 30:11.310
Thank you.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.216
(Laughing)

30:17.248 --> 30:18.985
You like it?

30:19.017 --> 30:22.354
I'm gonna get the real
Ferrari spider f430 soon.

30:22.388 --> 30:25.256
So what are you gonna do
with your newfound wealth?

30:25.290 --> 30:28.159
I think I'm going on break.
Early retirement.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.896
No car?

30:31.462 --> 30:34.000
Well, with that new
fashion model chick

30:34.033 --> 30:36.368
You might want to impress
her with a Ferrari.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.971
I don't think
she's materialistic.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.908
When are you
gonna grow up, man?

30:41.941 --> 30:43.409
Chicks love cars.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.143
If you want to get
into their pants,

30:45.176 --> 30:47.413
You'd better have
a nice hot Ferrari.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.280
She's my hot Ferrari.

30:49.314 --> 30:52.083
Besides, I love my mustang,
which is a plug-in hybrid.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.085
It gets 100mpg.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.087
Anyways,
I'm thinking about

30:56.122 --> 30:58.156
Opening up a green
tech company.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.158
Really?

31:01.192 --> 31:01.860
Oh, by the way,

31:01.860 --> 31:04.096
I know your
girlfriend nathalie.

31:04.129 --> 31:06.432
She's my girlfriend's
best friend.

31:06.464 --> 31:08.400
- Huh, small world.
- Yeah.

31:08.434 --> 31:11.670
And they're planning on setting
us up for a double date.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.340
- It's gonna be fun.
- Yeah.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.255
(Chatting quietly)

31:33.158 --> 31:36.028
Man, that was a good movie...
"an inconvenient truth."

31:36.062 --> 31:37.463
That is it.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.231
I'm getting myself a car
that's environmentally friendly.

31:40.265 --> 31:42.333
- Yeah.
- Good, you're finally
listening to me.

31:42.367 --> 31:44.103
That's right.

31:45.336 --> 31:48.440
Hey, mai and I got
to get back to work.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.476
So, uh...
Just trot off.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.444
Work?

31:52.478 --> 31:57.016
Yeah, you know,
sensual work.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.284
Oh, I see.
Understood.

31:59.317 --> 32:01.219
Well, you guys have
a good time.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.921
Yeah, all right.

32:23.509 --> 32:27.046
With mass solar's nano-based
solar panels,

32:27.078 --> 32:30.316
They cost the manufacturer
for one watt of electricity 10¢.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.484
That's a fraction
of the cost

32:32.518 --> 32:34.486
Of a recurring silicon-based
solar panel

32:34.520 --> 32:37.355
Which is $4 per watt.

32:37.388 --> 32:41.027
So a 3-kilowatt
mass solar nano-based

32:41.060 --> 32:43.996
Solar-powered system
would probably cost around

32:44.030 --> 32:45.363
$300-$500.

32:45.396 --> 32:49.300
At this price everyone
can afford solar power

32:49.334 --> 32:51.170
For their home
or businesses.

32:51.202 --> 32:53.438
With these panels,

32:53.472 --> 32:57.109
Solar power will be
available and affordable
for everyone.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.578
No need for leasing
or financing

32:59.611 --> 33:03.082
An expensive $20,000
silicon-based solar panel.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.782
Is there a patent?

33:04.816 --> 33:08.187
Yes, mass solar
owns the patent to
this technology.

33:08.219 --> 33:11.589
Good.
Who are your competitors?

33:11.622 --> 33:15.526
Companies like sun power,
silicon valley solar.

33:15.561 --> 33:17.528
But these companies'
solar panels

33:17.563 --> 33:19.798
Are based on
silicon technology,

33:19.830 --> 33:22.133
Which is very expensive
to manufacture.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.335
That's why
it's for $4 per watt.

33:24.370 --> 33:28.174
On the other hand,
mass solar's manufacturing
process

33:28.206 --> 33:30.441
Is simple,
it's low cost

33:30.475 --> 33:32.210
And it uses nanotechnology.

33:32.244 --> 33:35.581
That's why we're able to
deliver 10¢ per watt.

33:37.382 --> 33:41.019
So how much funding
are you requesting?

33:42.121 --> 33:43.689
$10 million.

33:47.325 --> 33:50.696
Guys, this is revolutionary
green tech.

33:53.264 --> 33:57.303
Contingent upon agreement
on our terms sheets,

33:57.335 --> 33:59.705
- we're going to fund you.
- Awesome.

35:39.705 --> 35:42.873
- Oh, lovers on the moon.
- Yeah.

36:23.782 --> 36:26.418
(No audible dialogue)

36:36.594 --> 36:38.629
Oh, look how cute.

37:20.671 --> 37:22.673
The sea is so beautiful.

37:26.711 --> 37:28.579
Yes, it is.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.049
You know, all life
came from the sea.

37:31.081 --> 37:34.052
I mean, look at us.
We're made of water.
So...

37:34.084 --> 37:36.888
So what is
your ideal man?

37:38.390 --> 37:39.791
Well, for one thing,

37:39.825 --> 37:42.059
He has to have a lot of
stock options invested.

37:42.092 --> 37:44.363
(Chuckles)
At least you're honest.

37:45.596 --> 37:49.468
He has to be kind,
honest,

37:49.500 --> 37:53.372
Successful,
ambitious,

37:53.405 --> 37:54.672
And opportunistic.

37:54.705 --> 37:57.443
- Is that all?
- Yup.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.811
So do you have, like,
a backup plan,

37:59.845 --> 38:02.079
You know, if your modeling
career doesn't work out?

38:02.112 --> 38:03.814
Not really.

38:03.849 --> 38:06.451
I figure if I don't make
it big by the time I'm 30,

38:06.485 --> 38:08.820
I figure I'll just
take it from there.

38:08.854 --> 38:10.821
You should have
a plan b now.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.423
I always do.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.593
I mean, look at me.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.695
I started out as
a software engineer

38:16.727 --> 38:18.729
And ended up a salesman.

38:18.763 --> 38:21.333
You sound like my mother.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.733
(Laughs)

38:22.767 --> 38:25.103
Good advice though.

38:25.135 --> 38:28.407
Who knows? Maybe I will
consider a career
in real estate,

38:28.439 --> 38:30.542
Or even becoming a wife

38:30.575 --> 38:32.710
Of a successful
entrepreneur.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.091
Look at these birds.

38:46.123 --> 38:47.893
Stop, don't touch it.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.828
It may be infectious.

38:49.861 --> 38:52.531
(Weeps, sniffles)

39:05.610 --> 39:07.746
(Doorbell rings)

39:09.848 --> 39:11.683
- Oh hi.
- Hi, mom.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.551
- How are you?
- Good good.

39:13.585 --> 39:14.853
- This is rod.
- Hi, rod.

39:14.885 --> 39:16.655
- So nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.157
Come on in, you guys.
Good to see you, honey.

39:19.189 --> 39:21.427
Come on in.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.664
Rod, nat tells me

39:25.696 --> 39:28.566
That you are a very
successful salesman.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.501
She did, huh?

39:30.536 --> 39:32.871
I am very passionate
about my career.

39:32.904 --> 39:35.773
So nathalie tells me
you recently retired.

39:35.806 --> 39:37.675
Yes, I did.

39:37.708 --> 39:40.579
And she mentioned that you were
gonna take an early retirement.

39:40.611 --> 39:42.747
Yeah, a few months.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.715
Just taking a little break.

39:44.749 --> 39:46.617
So are you enjoying
your retirement?

39:46.652 --> 39:48.954
I love the retirement.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.722
I was a jeweler
for 30 years.

39:51.756 --> 39:54.792
And sometimes I miss not
going into the jewelry store,

39:54.825 --> 39:57.795
But, you know,
I really like retirement.

39:57.828 --> 40:00.599
I like to travel.
I like to cruise.

40:00.631 --> 40:03.668
And I enjoy
watching television.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.871
And my biggest thing

40:05.904 --> 40:07.806
Is I love to watch nat

40:07.838 --> 40:10.575
And work with her
in her modeling career.

40:10.608 --> 40:14.178
Wow, nathalie's
a lucky person to have
such a loving mother.

40:14.212 --> 40:17.515
Oh, thanks, rod.
I appreciate that.

40:17.548 --> 40:20.018
My big thing is to make sure
that she's happy

40:20.050 --> 40:23.789
And successful in whatever
she chooses to do.

40:23.821 --> 40:26.056
Thanks, mom.

40:51.082 --> 40:53.818
Hello.
Here's your drinks.

40:53.851 --> 40:56.021
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.556
Can I get you
anything else?

40:57.589 --> 41:00.858
We're still
looking at the menu.
Thank you.

41:00.891 --> 41:02.460
- Hope you enjoy.
- Thanks.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.697
I really enjoyed
meeting your mother.

41:06.732 --> 41:08.699
She seemed
to really like you.

41:09.735 --> 41:12.804
I was so lonely
until now.

41:12.838 --> 41:15.807
So do you think
I'm that right lady?

41:15.841 --> 41:17.675
Maybe.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.243
Do you think
I'm the ideal man?

41:19.277 --> 41:21.146
Perhaps.

41:22.613 --> 41:24.583
You know, rod,
I was just kidding

41:24.615 --> 41:26.585
About the stock options,

41:26.617 --> 41:29.687
Shopping and money
and all that.

41:29.721 --> 41:30.921
All I want is you.

41:30.955 --> 41:32.623
Are you sure?

41:32.658 --> 41:35.260
Definitely.

41:35.292 --> 41:39.598
Guys are usually just
into me for my looks
and sex.

41:39.631 --> 41:41.700
But you're not
like that.

41:41.732 --> 41:44.002
You're a real gentleman.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.971
I feel like you
really respect me.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.107
That means a lot to me.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.876
I feel like I could be
with you for a long time.

41:51.909 --> 41:54.512
Then I'm one lucky man.

41:57.948 --> 42:00.018
I think my luck has changed
since I met you.

42:00.051 --> 42:01.752
Really?
Why's that?

42:01.787 --> 42:04.623
Last week the company n.C.T.
Software that I work for

42:04.656 --> 42:07.324
Was bought for $1 billion
by oracle corporation.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.728
And this week my start-up
company that I founded,

42:10.762 --> 42:13.031
Mass solar,
got funded $10 million

42:13.063 --> 42:14.699
By evergreen capital.

42:14.732 --> 42:15.934
Wow.

42:15.966 --> 42:18.669
You said that might happen.
Congratulations.

42:18.704 --> 42:20.138
Thanks.

44:21.058 --> 44:22.993
Thank you.

44:38.108 --> 44:39.878
So?

44:39.910 --> 44:42.046
What do you think?

44:55.293 --> 44:58.162
You look divine.

47:01.218 --> 47:03.854
(Birds screeching)

47:06.457 --> 47:08.826
(Bird roaring)

47:20.906 --> 47:23.074
(Birds screeching)

47:33.451 --> 47:35.620
(Birds screeching)

47:58.076 --> 47:59.544
Rod.

48:01.245 --> 48:02.880
What is it?

48:07.184 --> 48:09.053
I think they're eagles.

48:09.087 --> 48:11.155
What in the world?

48:19.729 --> 48:21.199
Battery is dead.

48:21.231 --> 48:24.334
What's going on?
Can they get in?

48:27.005 --> 48:29.274
Not for the moment.

48:34.111 --> 48:35.981
(Screeching)

48:38.715 --> 48:40.217
(Thumps)

48:40.250 --> 48:42.087
(Thumping)

48:42.120 --> 48:43.387
Rod, they're breaking in
through the window.

48:43.421 --> 48:45.355
Hurry, let's barricade it
with the bed.

48:45.389 --> 48:46.656
Hurry!

49:20.558 --> 49:22.693
That should hold 'em.

49:30.201 --> 49:31.601
(Screeching stops)

49:36.041 --> 49:37.242
I think they're gone.

49:38.408 --> 49:41.445
Well, do you know
why they stopped?

49:41.479 --> 49:44.615
I don't know.
Maybe they got tired.

49:46.184 --> 49:48.019
Why would birds do
something like that?

49:48.053 --> 49:51.256
I mean, why would
they just attack?

49:51.288 --> 49:53.558
I don't know.

50:05.070 --> 50:07.205
Anybody in here?

50:07.237 --> 50:08.706
Come on.

50:11.242 --> 50:12.776
- Name's rod.
- Ramsey.

50:12.810 --> 50:14.245
- This is nathalie.
- Nice to meet you.

50:14.278 --> 50:15.779
- My girlfriend Becky.
- Hi.

50:15.813 --> 50:18.182
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, we're all right.

50:18.215 --> 50:20.385
- I guess.
- Man, those birds were
attacking all night

50:20.417 --> 50:22.087
Then they just
suddenly stopped.

50:22.120 --> 50:24.421
We'd try to drive away but
I can't find my car keys.

50:24.454 --> 50:26.456
- I lost them somewhere.
- They were attacking us too.

50:26.490 --> 50:28.326
We have a van outside.

50:28.358 --> 50:29.827
- You guys are more
than welcome to come.
- Yeah, come with us.

50:29.859 --> 50:30.761
Thank you.

50:30.794 --> 50:33.064
We need something
to protect ourselves.

50:37.367 --> 50:39.304
Use these.

50:40.404 --> 50:42.439
Here you go.
All right.

50:42.472 --> 50:44.809
Let's all get our backs
to each other.

50:44.841 --> 50:47.377
That we can see the birds
coming from every direction.

50:47.411 --> 50:49.379
- Okay.
- Just like this.

50:49.413 --> 50:51.116
- (Exhales)
- All right, ready?

50:51.149 --> 50:52.583
- Rod: Let's go.
- Let's go.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.462
Here they come!

51:05.495 --> 51:07.664
(Screeching)

51:13.571 --> 51:15.406
Open the door.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.642
Becky:
The door's stuck.

51:17.674 --> 51:20.111
The door's stuck.

51:25.549 --> 51:27.385
Hurry up.

51:29.286 --> 51:31.189
I can't hurry up.

51:57.648 --> 51:59.416
Damn birds
scratched me.

51:59.449 --> 52:01.719
Becky, hand me a gun.
Rod, drive.

52:08.292 --> 52:10.261
(Gunfire)

52:12.329 --> 52:14.331
Here, rod.
Take a pistol.

52:16.601 --> 52:18.268
Let's go.

52:20.705 --> 52:22.640
(Gunfire)

52:27.678 --> 52:30.215
Hey, there's dead people
on the side of the road.

52:30.248 --> 52:32.383
Let's go see
if there's any survivors.

52:32.416 --> 52:34.219
Okay.

52:49.667 --> 52:52.303
Becky, cover us.

52:52.337 --> 52:54.672
I'll check out this car,
you check out the other.

52:54.705 --> 52:56.307
Okay.

53:04.782 --> 53:06.583
They're dead.

53:06.616 --> 53:08.918
(Girl crying)

53:13.323 --> 53:16.293
Come on, honey.
Come over here.

53:16.326 --> 53:17.762
Come out from under the car.
Come on.

53:17.794 --> 53:21.598
No, I don't want to come out.
The birds will bite me.

53:21.631 --> 53:23.333
No they won't.
Come on.

53:23.368 --> 53:24.702
I'll protect you,
I promise.

53:24.735 --> 53:28.306
I'm scared.
They killed my mommy.

53:28.338 --> 53:31.641
(Crying)
They killed my mommy.

53:36.012 --> 53:37.782
(Birds screeching)

53:39.048 --> 53:42.487
- It's the birds!
- (Gunfire)

53:47.425 --> 53:48.993
Boy:
Help!

53:49.025 --> 53:50.594
Help!

53:50.627 --> 53:52.430
Let me out!

53:59.603 --> 54:02.572
- Help!
- Run for it.
Let's go.

54:02.606 --> 54:04.375
Help!

54:10.781 --> 54:13.651
Come on,
let's go.

54:13.683 --> 54:15.553
Come on.

54:15.586 --> 54:17.787
- (Gunfire)
- Come on!

54:21.591 --> 54:23.828
- Let's go.
- Come on.

54:41.479 --> 54:43.381
(Gunfire)

55:11.508 --> 55:13.378
What's your name,
sweetie?

55:13.410 --> 55:15.078
Susan.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.884
We're gonna make this
feel all better.

55:19.917 --> 55:21.451
Thank you.

55:22.752 --> 55:24.622
Thanks.

55:25.856 --> 55:27.657
Thank you.

55:31.396 --> 55:33.663
- Oh, you want to play?
- Okay.

55:40.737 --> 55:44.375
I'm hungry.
I've been under the car
for a long time.

55:44.409 --> 55:45.742
Yeah, me too.

55:45.775 --> 55:47.677
I'm starving.

55:50.881 --> 55:52.649
Hey, the kids
are getting hungry.

55:52.682 --> 55:54.684
We should stop and get
some food for them.

55:54.718 --> 55:56.653
And some for us too.

55:56.686 --> 55:59.123
There's a convenience store
close by.

55:59.155 --> 56:01.090
We'll stop there.

56:10.467 --> 56:13.069
Becky, watch Tony while
he sleeps, okay?

56:26.650 --> 56:28.785
I'll stand guard.
You go get food and water.

56:28.818 --> 56:30.421
Okay.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.895
You want to get
some candy?

56:37.928 --> 56:39.930
Okay.

56:39.964 --> 56:43.033
- Get some for Tony too.
- Okay.

57:46.731 --> 57:48.666
(Birds screeching)

57:54.639 --> 57:56.272
Let's go, guys.
The eagles are coming.

57:56.305 --> 57:58.543
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

57:58.576 --> 58:00.745
The eagles are attacking.
Come on, let's go.

58:06.916 --> 58:08.918
(Gunfire)

59:29.133 --> 59:31.802
Hey, look.
There's an old guy
on the bridge.

59:42.780 --> 59:45.115
Hey, mister.
What the hell are you
doing out here?

59:45.149 --> 59:47.718
Hey hey!
Stand back!

59:47.752 --> 59:50.954
These birds are contagious.
Now go away.

59:54.057 --> 59:56.360
Hey, I thought I told
you to stand back.

59:56.392 --> 59:58.095
These birds are
contaminated.

59:58.128 --> 01:00:00.097
They have bird flu virus.

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.766
Now go away.

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:05.001
Could we just talk about it
at the picnic area?

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:07.904
You want to talk?
Okay.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:09.940
All right.
We'll talk.

01:00:24.421 --> 01:00:26.956
(Kids laughing)

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:28.825
Guys, this is
Dr. Jones.

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:30.026
How do you do?

01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:32.162
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:36.734
Sir, don't you know
that these birds are
attacking people?

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:38.034
- These birds?
- Yes.

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:41.171
No way.
They're dead from
the bird flu virus.

01:00:41.205 --> 01:00:43.407
- Bird flu virus?
- How do you know this?

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:45.441
I just tested their blood.

01:00:45.474 --> 01:00:47.177
Then why are they
attacking us?

01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:49.747
I don't know.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:53.049
But what I do know
is global warming is
causing viral diseases

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:56.721
Such as bird flu,
west nile virus and SARS.

01:00:56.754 --> 01:00:57.855
So what are you saying?

01:00:57.887 --> 01:01:00.424
That global warming is causing
these birds to attack?

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:02.058
No.

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:05.061
I'm a scientist...
An ornithologist.

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:08.898
I can't state any scientific
fact without evidence.

01:01:08.933 --> 01:01:11.736
But there is scientific
evidence to show

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:13.770
That because of our
burning of fossil fuels

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:15.072
And creating
greenhouse gasses

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:17.074
Which is causing
global warming,

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:19.076
It's raising the temperature
of the seas

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:21.746
And species like
the krill are dying.

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:25.182
So many bird species
can't find food

01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:26.883
Like the neritic
krill.

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:29.018
They eventually
starve and die,

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:30.921
Wash up on the shore.

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:33.122
There's also evidence
that global warming

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:35.960
Is interrupting the birth,
mating and migration cycles

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:37.828
Of many species.

01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:40.029
In fact,
in the last few years

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:42.867
40 species have become extinct
because of global warming.

01:01:44.268 --> 01:01:47.003
However, there is
interesting research

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:49.273
That in prehistoric times

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:51.140
Birds did attack cavemen.

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:54.845
They used to claw
at their eyes and skull.

01:01:54.879 --> 01:01:57.513
They'd either leave them
for dead or then come back

01:01:57.546 --> 01:01:59.115
Because their injuries
were so bad

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:01.718
And finally
finish off the kill.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.990
If they attack me,

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:09.493
I've got a little
present for them.

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:12.261
Well, you certainly know
a lot about birds.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:16.165
Well, I should.
I'm an ornithologist.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.002
I study and work with birds
for a living.

01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:21.004
You should come with us.
It's safer.

01:02:21.038 --> 01:02:23.774
I don't need protection.
I can take care of myself.

01:02:23.808 --> 01:02:26.009
I've got my truck
and my trailer.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:30.179
Besides, I'm not worried
about the blackbirds.

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:32.817
They're not
the dangerous animal.

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:35.184
It's the human species
that's the dangerous

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:37.553
And menacing
and terrifying animal.

01:02:37.586 --> 01:02:40.858
Because of his fossil fuel
related activities,

01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:42.225
He's causing global warming.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:44.528
It's killing life
and earth itself.

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:47.932
It's the human species

01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:50.835
That needs to quit playing
cowboy with nature.

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:55.071
We must act
more like astronauts,

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:59.075
Spacemen taking care of
our spaceship earth.

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:03.780
Well, nice meeting you.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.215
Good luck.

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:20.930
Where's Becky?

01:03:20.965 --> 01:03:23.066
She's taking a shit.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.969
Nathalie's watching her back.

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:26.603
You're pretty
good at shooting.

01:03:26.635 --> 01:03:28.906
How come you're still
not in the marines?

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:32.042
I just got tired of all
the fucking killing in Iraq.

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:36.346
Why can't we just give
peace a chance?

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:47.123
Right there.

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:49.526
- I'll cover you.
- Okay.

01:03:54.932 --> 01:03:57.467
- (Screeches)
- (Screams)

01:03:58.402 --> 01:04:00.470
(Gunshots)

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:08.144
Oh my God,
she's dead.

01:04:12.316 --> 01:04:14.351
Rod!

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:17.286
Rod!
Ramsey!

01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:19.323
She's dead.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:21.358
I couldn't do anything.
She's dead.

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:23.192
What do you mean
she's dead?

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:52.022
- (Birds screeching)
- Let's go!

01:04:52.056 --> 01:04:54.257
(Gunfire)

01:04:57.326 --> 01:04:59.563
Come on,
let's go!

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:33.463
The eagles killed Becky.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.968
Fucking killed Becky.

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:42.606
I'm sorry.

01:05:44.474 --> 01:05:47.111
I'm sorry, Ramsey.

01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:50.179
They got to her before
I got a chance.

01:06:03.027 --> 01:06:03.960
I don't know what to do.

01:06:16.239 --> 01:06:19.075
Hey, those people
on that bus are being
attacked by those birds.

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:21.444
- (Screeching)
- (People screaming)

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.350
- Let's go save them.
- We can't. We have no room.

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:29.086
- It's full in here.
- They killed Becky.

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:31.420
What if it was nathalie?

01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:40.697
- (Birds screeching)
- (Gunfire)

01:06:42.266 --> 01:06:44.467
Please help me!

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.243
Help!

01:06:54.278 --> 01:06:56.613
Come on.
I've got to get
out of here.

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:08.491
Ramsey:
Come on, guys, let's go.
The birds are gone.

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:10.193
No they're not.
They're not gone.

01:07:10.227 --> 01:07:11.827
They're gonna kill us
if we go out there.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.296
Come on, let's go.

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:15.564
I don't want to.
They'll kill us.

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:17.534
Rod, I'm gonna go
get those people.

01:07:17.566 --> 01:07:19.568
- Cover me, okay?
- Okay.

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:23.773
(People screaming)

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.146
- Come on, let's go.
- No.

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:31.180
- Come on.
Let's go.
- No.

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:33.249
- Come on.
- No.

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:34.817
Let's go.

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:41.390
Help me! No!
I don't want to go!

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:43.227
- Come on.
- No no!

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.461
- I don't want to go!
- Let's go.

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:51.101
- No!
- Don't make me
go out there!

01:07:54.204 --> 01:07:57.073
- Follow me.
- (Gunshots)

01:08:09.619 --> 01:08:13.189
- (Gasps)
- (Screaming)

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:16.125
(Screeching)

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.562
(Screaming, moaning)

01:08:21.465 --> 01:08:24.268
(Moaning continues)

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.652
(Birds screeching)

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.720
(Gunshots)

01:09:06.243 --> 01:09:07.943
I'm going out there
to save them.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.912
Don't go.
If you go out there
you'll die.

01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:11.515
They're dead already.

01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:13.182
Yeah, you're right.

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:14.884
Let's get the hell
out of here.

01:09:57.361 --> 01:09:59.363
Hi.
The eagles killed
our friends.

01:09:59.396 --> 01:10:00.996
Do you have a phone I can
use to call the police?

01:10:01.029 --> 01:10:03.767
No, I'm sorry.
All phones from
the eagle attack...

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.002
All phones
are dead up here.

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:08.572
Really?
Damn it.

01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:10.407
Well, we need some gas.

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:12.408
Well, you know,
from the eagle attack

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:13.777
We are short on gas.

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:15.978
But it's $100 a gallon
if you want.

01:10:16.012 --> 01:10:18.381
What? $100?
That's outrageous.

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:20.584
Well, either you
take it or leave it.

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:22.752
I have only a few
gallons left only.

01:10:22.786 --> 01:10:26.590
It's a rip-off.
Fine.

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:32.262
Thank you.

01:10:32.296 --> 01:10:34.731
Tony, Susan, can you guys go
get some water over there?

01:10:34.764 --> 01:10:36.599
Then you can go get
candy for yourselves.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:38.435
- Yay.
- Okay.

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:14.870
(Screeching)

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:20.476
(Gunshots)

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:37.593
Hey, look at
that man up there.

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:39.094
We should stop
and help him.

01:11:39.127 --> 01:11:40.864
Okay.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.489
- Howdy.
- Hi.

01:12:06.523 --> 01:12:08.424
Can you sell me some gas
for my truck?

01:12:08.458 --> 01:12:10.559
We only have a few gallons
and we need them.

01:12:10.594 --> 01:12:12.829
We just bought some for $100
a gallon down the street.

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:16.432
$100 a gallon?
I've only got 50
in my wallet.

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.835
- We can give you a ride.
- Oh, no thanks.

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:21.405
Sorry, but we need it.

01:12:23.171 --> 01:12:25.642
- You're gonna sell
me some gas now.
- Whoa, take it easy.

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:27.911
Take it easy.
I've got an extra tank
in the back.

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:29.111
Good.
Get it.

01:12:58.475 --> 01:13:00.477
(Screeches)

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:23.900
Rod, let's get
out of here.

01:13:29.237 --> 01:13:31.140
(Engine starts)

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:08.812
(Engine stops)

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:11.747
There's a creek over there.
We can get some fresh water.

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:13.016
Okay.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:44.847
(Water flowing)

01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:24.688
Who's there?
Who's there?

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:25.889
Come out or I'll shoot.

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:29.058
Don't shoot.
Peace, man.

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:30.760
Come down here.

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:55.051
Why were you hiding
in the trees?

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:57.120
This is my home.
I live here.

01:15:57.153 --> 01:15:59.122
That's my house.

01:16:05.695 --> 01:16:07.830
You live in a tree?

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:10.700
Sure do.

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:14.070
So you're a tree hugger?

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:16.705
You could put it that way.

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.642
I love trees.
They're my family.

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:22.378
I look out for them
and protect these
precious redwoods.

01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:25.682
So you can play
in your tree house?

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:27.751
Sure.

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:29.753
Yes, that'll be fun!

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:32.121
No way, it's too dangerous.
The eagles might come there.

01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:35.324
Oh, they won't.
You're very safe here
in the forest.

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:37.325
Haven't you noticed
those eagles

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:40.328
Seem to be going after people
in their cars and gas stations?

01:16:40.363 --> 01:16:43.031
Besides, it's not the eagles
I worry about.

01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:46.034
It's the dry drought weather
that's killing these trees.

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:48.638
There's not enough
rain and water.

01:16:48.672 --> 01:16:51.840
Even worse, the spruce bark
beetles are eating

01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:54.811
These trees
to death and turning them
from green to red.

01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:58.013
I remember when those
beetles used to die out
during the winter.

01:16:58.046 --> 01:17:01.016
But now with the dry climate
they've multiplied

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:02.886
And taken over the forest.

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:04.620
Take a look at that
dead redwood up there.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.190
That was killed
by a bark beetle.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:15.764
This damn global warming.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:18.702
It's the cause of dry climate
and bark beetles

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:21.036
And death of the trees
and forest.

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:23.105
I can protect these trees

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:25.809
Against greedy
lumber companies

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:28.812
And bad campers who start
forest wildfires.

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:32.816
But it's impossible to protect
them against global warming.

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:35.151
- What's your name?
- I'm tom hill.

01:17:35.184 --> 01:17:38.755
I'm rod. This is nathalie,
Susan and Tony.

01:17:41.758 --> 01:17:43.159
You can come with us.

01:17:43.192 --> 01:17:45.729
Oh, I can't.

01:17:45.762 --> 01:17:47.062
This is my home.

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:50.132
I have to stay here
to protect these trees
from further harm.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:53.937
Enjoy and appreciate these
trees while you can.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.407
In a few years
they'll be gone.

01:17:59.442 --> 01:18:01.043
- (Growling)
- I hear a Mountain lion.

01:18:01.076 --> 01:18:02.746
I've got to get
back to my house.

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:04.680
You'd better get to your car.
It was very nice meeting you.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.449
You too.

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:41.950
I think it's this way
to the van.

01:18:41.985 --> 01:18:43.787
- No, it's this way.
- Are you sure?

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.187
What's that smell?

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:47.423
Smells like wood burning.

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:55.731
It's a forest fire.
Let's go, come on.
This way.

01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:04.507
(Coughing)

01:19:20.123 --> 01:19:22.358
(Coughing)

01:19:34.871 --> 01:19:36.404
(Engine starts)

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:10.272
- You see that lighthouse
over there?
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:13.176
That's where mai lives.
We should stop by and see
if she's there.

01:20:13.209 --> 01:20:14.943
Okay.

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:19.148
- Oh my God.
- What?

01:20:19.182 --> 01:20:21.083
That's mai's car.

01:20:21.117 --> 01:20:23.887
- We should pull over.
- Okay.

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:50.578
Oh God, mai.
Mai, are you okay?

01:20:50.613 --> 01:20:52.615
Mai.

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:54.316
Nat?

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:56.119
Mai.

01:20:56.151 --> 01:20:58.955
(Weakly)
Forgive them...

01:20:58.988 --> 01:21:01.024
Mai.
Mai?

01:21:01.057 --> 01:21:03.591
Mai!
God.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.029
Mai.

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:34.057
Damn it!
We ran out of gas.

01:21:34.089 --> 01:21:36.024
What are we gonna do?

01:21:36.059 --> 01:21:38.894
If we're lucky someone
might drive by.

01:21:54.978 --> 01:21:58.081
- I'm hungry.
- Me too, I'm hungry.

01:21:58.114 --> 01:22:00.148
We've got to find a way
to get them some food.

01:22:00.183 --> 01:22:02.952
- What should we do?
- I don't know.

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:21.937
Hey look, a fishing rod.

01:22:23.006 --> 01:22:24.540
I can go catch some fish.

01:22:26.074 --> 01:22:29.277
Oh look, a stove.
We can cook it.

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:32.380
Hey, good idea.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.616
(Chatting quietly)

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:25.234
Hey, nat.
I'll go fishing over there.

01:23:25.267 --> 01:23:27.303
How about you and the kids
go get some seaweed?

01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:29.072
Okay.

01:23:32.575 --> 01:23:34.310
You guys eat seaweed?

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:36.478
Seaweed's the best.
It's good for your health.

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:38.547
Nathalie:
Is that right?

01:24:25.393 --> 01:24:27.430
Rod:
I caught a fish!

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:29.865
- He caught a fish.
- Yay!

01:24:29.897 --> 01:24:31.533
Awesome.

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:41.809
I got a fish.

01:24:41.844 --> 01:24:43.612
Looks good.

01:24:43.646 --> 01:24:45.413
I got some seaweed.

01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:50.452
Good.

01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:52.288
I'm gonna go up to the van
and get the stove

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.089
So we can cook this.

01:25:28.724 --> 01:25:31.660
Here you go.
This'll be good for us.

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:36.598
Yuck.
I want a happy meal.

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:38.866
Me too.

01:25:38.901 --> 01:25:41.503
I know, you guys.
There's no happy meals
around here.

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:44.173
Just try the seaweed.
It'll be really good.

01:25:44.207 --> 01:25:46.608
- No.
- No, I want a happy meal.

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:48.576
I don't know.

01:25:53.716 --> 01:25:55.883
(Birds screeching)

01:25:57.952 --> 01:25:59.554
Guys.
Guys, get up.

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:00.656
The eagles.
The eagles.

01:26:00.689 --> 01:26:02.590
Come on,
we've got to go.

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:09.732
(Screeching)

01:26:26.982 --> 01:26:29.418
(Gunshots)

01:26:37.024 --> 01:26:39.762
(Thumping)

01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:50.373
Damn,
I'm out of bullets.

01:26:56.379 --> 01:26:58.714
Nat, you hit them if they get
through windshield, okay?

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:20.969
(Thumps)

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:40.555
(Screeching fades)

01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:49.765
Look!
They're leaving.

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:50.852
I wonder why they
stopped the attack.

01:29:51.305 --> 01:29:57.381
