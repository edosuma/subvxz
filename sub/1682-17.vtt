00:00.567 --> 00:02.866
<i>in 2010,
, on a warm March evening</i>

00:02.868 --> 00:06.001
<i>a New York City police boat
pulled a 34-year-old white male</i>

00:06.034 --> 00:08.500
<i>out of the Hudson River:
your Uncle Barney.</i>

00:08.534 --> 00:10.634
All right, kid,
let's hear the story.

00:10.667 --> 00:11.967
From the beginning.

00:12.001 --> 00:14.433
Well, it all started a week ago.

00:14.467 --> 00:17.400
<i>I was making time
at the local watering hole.</i>

00:18.268 --> 00:21.767
<i>Enter... a dame.</i>

00:28.534 --> 00:31.333
Nothing sexier than a man
in a fine cravat.

00:31.367 --> 00:35.333
Except for a woman who
appreciates a fine cravat.

00:37.667 --> 00:40.034
How about we just
call it a tie?

00:41.067 --> 00:42.834
(both laughing)

00:42.867 --> 00:44.433
(chuckling)

00:44.467 --> 00:46.534
You see, a cravat
is a kind of tie.

00:46.567 --> 00:48.101
I get it.
Anyway,

00:48.134 --> 00:49.600
next thing you know,

00:49.634 --> 00:51.333
I get her back to my place.

00:51.367 --> 00:53.001
Barney...

00:53.034 --> 00:55.201
when I get in bed with a man,

00:55.234 --> 00:58.767
my body becomes a machine
fueled by desire, lust

00:58.801 --> 01:04.001
and a singular hunger to satisfy
my lover's every carnal need.

01:04.034 --> 01:07.300
Good thing the cleaning
lady's coming tomorrow.

01:09.567 --> 01:10.901
Well, good night.

01:10.934 --> 01:11.934
What?

01:11.967 --> 01:13.201
Wait, what?

01:13.234 --> 01:15.367
I thought your body was going
to become a machine

01:15.400 --> 01:18.001
fueled by desire, lust
and a singular hunger

01:18.034 --> 01:19.767
to satisfy my every carnal need.

01:19.801 --> 01:21.901
No.

01:36.867 --> 01:37.932
(all laughing)

01:37.967 --> 01:39.783
You know, I really
think that Don and I

01:39.818 --> 01:41.600
are hitting our stride
as a news team.

01:41.635 --> 01:42.868
Yeah.
DON: Well, all credit

01:42.903 --> 01:44.301
goes to this lady
on my left.

01:44.336 --> 01:45.665
Oh, come on.
That story you did

01:45.700 --> 01:47.400
on which rodents
to avoid on the subway...

01:47.435 --> 01:49.367
The answer may
surprise you.

01:49.402 --> 01:50.834
It's all of them.

01:50.869 --> 01:51.932
(chuckling)

01:51.967 --> 01:53.967
Well, I got to run,
okay? I'll see you. Okay.

01:54.002 --> 01:55.600
It's good to meet you.
Yeah, you, too.

01:55.635 --> 01:57.567
Take care.
Okay. Bye, Don.

01:58.667 --> 02:01.199
Okay, Robin, that
guy is awesome.

02:01.234 --> 02:03.365
He's funny, he's
smart, he's handsome.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.700
You got to scoop him up
before someone else does.

02:05.735 --> 02:07.899
I hope you're not talking
about you.

02:07.934 --> 02:10.366
It has been four months
since you broke up with Barney.

02:10.401 --> 02:12.600
Maybe it's time
to put yourself back out there.

02:12.635 --> 02:14.400
Yeah, exactly.
Barney's dating again,

02:14.435 --> 02:16.184
and he couldn't be happier.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.934
I couldn't be more unhappy.

02:17.969 --> 02:19.099
All night long,

02:19.134 --> 02:20.298
she's hot and heavy for me.

02:20.333 --> 02:22.667
I get her back to my place,
and she just bolts?

02:22.702 --> 02:24.599
I mean, at least
when I run out on a girl,

02:24.634 --> 02:27.734
I have the common courtesy
to sleep with her first.

02:27.769 --> 02:29.067
It's... it's called manners.

02:29.102 --> 02:30.332
Sounds like she

02:30.367 --> 02:32.400
<i>read that book,
Of Course You're Still Single-</i>

02:32.435 --> 02:34.433
<i>Take a Look at Yourself,
You Dumb Slut.</i>

02:35.734 --> 02:37.632
What? It... it's this book

02:37.667 --> 02:39.901
that helps single girls
find a husband.

02:40.767 --> 02:42.166
It's Robin's copy.

02:42.201 --> 02:44.034
I've just... I leafed
through it a little bit.

02:44.069 --> 02:46.067
Really. Were you getting
a mani-pedi?

02:46.102 --> 02:47.134
(all talking over each other)

02:47.169 --> 02:48.567
Okay, okay, okay.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.999
Fine.

02:50.034 --> 02:52.398
Barney, when you
were with this girl,

02:52.433 --> 02:55.901
did she subtly slip the word
"sex" into conversation?

02:56.801 --> 02:59.066
I'm in the inter-sex-tion,

02:59.101 --> 03:02.534
and I only have a couple of sex
before the light changes.

03:02.569 --> 03:04.732
I mean, everyone's
honking at me,

03:04.767 --> 03:08.398
and it totally sex,
but I can't turn around

03:08.433 --> 03:11.934
because a jogger slipped
and fell in horse sex-crement.

03:11.969 --> 03:15.034
Go on. Go on.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.665
Did she make excuses

03:16.700 --> 03:18.534
to establish physical contact
with you?

03:19.467 --> 03:21.083
Is this cashmere?

03:21.118 --> 03:22.665
Cashmere? (scoffs)

03:22.700 --> 03:24.999
This is hand-spun
virgin merino.

03:25.034 --> 03:29.967
The fibers in this suit are
less than 12 microns thick.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.398
12 microns.

03:32.433 --> 03:35.032
I love a tiny fiber.

03:35.067 --> 03:38.767
Well, you're in luck,
because mine's the tiniest.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.867
And the more
you touch it,

03:40.902 --> 03:43.834
the softer it gets.

03:45.234 --> 03:46.967
(chuckles softly)

03:48.001 --> 03:50.465
She did that, too.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.001
Now, here is the final test.

03:52.036 --> 03:53.233
Next time you see her,

03:53.268 --> 03:54.901
ask her out
for the following night.

03:54.936 --> 03:56.432
The book says that's forbidden,

03:56.467 --> 04:00.134
so she'll probably give you
some lame excuse like this:

04:00.169 --> 04:02.298
"Ooh, I can't do anything
tomorrow night."

04:02.333 --> 04:04.567
BOTH: I've already made plans
to clean my garbage disposal

04:04.602 --> 04:06.234
and treat myself
to a bubble bath.

04:06.269 --> 04:07.867
But how about next week
sometime?

04:07.902 --> 04:09.233
BARNEY:
Aha!

04:09.268 --> 04:11.517
<i>You're trying that
Of Course You're Still Single-</i>

04:11.552 --> 04:13.926
<i>Take a Look at Yourself,
You Dumb Slut crap on me.</i>

04:13.961 --> 04:16.265
<i>It's not crap. Of Course
You're Still Single-</i>

04:16.300 --> 04:18.901
<i>Take a Look at Yourself,You
Dumb Slut is a brilliant book.</i>

04:18.935 --> 04:19.866
And...

04:19.901 --> 04:20.966
it scares away guys

04:21.000 --> 04:22.600
who are only interested
in getting laid.

04:22.635 --> 04:25.565
Why not just say
you have a kid?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.801
You'd be surprised how many
jerks there are out there.

04:27.836 --> 04:28.799
That's why the book says

04:28.834 --> 04:30.734
never sleep with a guy
on the first date.

04:30.769 --> 04:32.168
Totally.
Or the second date.

04:32.203 --> 04:33.502
Of course.
Or the third date.

04:33.537 --> 04:34.766
Well...
Or the fourth date.

04:34.801 --> 04:36.734
Well, just tell me
how many dates!

04:36.769 --> 04:38.551
Seventeen.

04:38.586 --> 04:40.333
S... S...

04:41.101 --> 04:43.367
Excuse me,
is anyone using this?

04:46.834 --> 04:51.101
Yep, here it is:
no sex until after 17 dates.

04:51.136 --> 04:52.133
LILY:
Barney, if you're not

04:52.168 --> 04:53.967
going to take her
out on 17 dates,

04:54.002 --> 04:55.767
I think you should
just give it up.

04:55.802 --> 04:57.032
Oh, no.

04:57.067 --> 04:59.201
I'm not the one
who's going to give it up.

04:59.236 --> 05:00.432
She is.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.167
Because, thanks
to Ted's book...

05:02.202 --> 05:03.832
That's Robin's. It's Robin's.

05:03.867 --> 05:06.333
...I can stay two steps ahead
of her at all times.

05:06.368 --> 05:07.734
There's a loophole
in here somewhere,

05:07.769 --> 05:09.067
and I'm going to find it.

05:09.102 --> 05:10.934
(phone rings)

05:10.969 --> 05:11.999
Hello.

05:12.034 --> 05:13.700
Hey, Robin.
Oh, hey, Don.

05:13.735 --> 05:15.799
Listen, uh...

05:15.834 --> 05:17.834
do you want to go out
Saturday night?

05:17.869 --> 05:18.966
Saturday night...

05:19.001 --> 05:20.367
(hushed):
Is he asking you out?

05:20.402 --> 05:21.665
Say yes! Say yes!

05:21.700 --> 05:24.300
Look, Don, um...
listen, it...

05:24.335 --> 05:26.901
it's really sweet
of you to ask,

05:26.936 --> 05:29.066
and you're a great guy...

05:29.101 --> 05:30.567
(falsetto):
Yes, I will go out with you.

05:30.602 --> 05:32.199
Robin, are you okay?

05:32.234 --> 05:34.899
Um, I just had
a little cold.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.333
That's probably
what you're hearing.

05:36.368 --> 05:38.217
But Saturday night sounds great.

05:38.252 --> 05:40.032
We can even go
to a steak house,

05:40.067 --> 05:41.867
and you can bring home
some prime rib

05:41.902 --> 05:43.166
for my friend, Marshall.

05:43.201 --> 05:45.384
Okay, gotta go. Love you. Bye.

05:45.419 --> 05:47.493
What the hell
are you thinking?

05:47.528 --> 05:49.567
Robin, you've got to do this,
okay?

05:49.602 --> 05:51.634
A great guy like Don is rare.

05:51.669 --> 05:53.732
And speaking of rare,

05:53.767 --> 05:55.734
prime rib- don't forget.
Thank you.

05:57.901 --> 05:59.565
Oh, my God.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.817
I don't believe it.

06:01.852 --> 06:04.034
Guys... this is her!

06:04.634 --> 06:06.634
She wrote the book.

06:07.268 --> 06:09.300
Huh. Her name must be Anita.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.665
Okay.

06:10.700 --> 06:14.433
My plan was to sleep with her,
but this changes everything.

06:14.468 --> 06:16.432
New plan:

06:16.467 --> 06:19.667
I'm going to sleep with her.

06:21.134 --> 06:23.584
Boy, this girl
that Barney's going after,

06:23.619 --> 06:26.034
she kind of sounds like
the anti-Barney.

06:26.069 --> 06:27.632
Mmm. I love how the universe

06:27.667 --> 06:30.532
decided to bring
those two together.

06:30.567 --> 06:33.486
Actually, Anita's going after
Barney because I told her to.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.000
Wait, you sicced Anita
on Barney?

06:42.035 --> 06:43.401
How do you
even know her?

06:43.436 --> 06:44.965
She was on my show.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
But, um, if you had
to summarize your book

06:48.035 --> 06:49.898
in 30 words or less...

06:49.933 --> 06:52.134
I'll summarize it
in one word, Robin.

06:52.169 --> 06:53.401
And that word

06:53.436 --> 06:54.701
is "no."

06:54.736 --> 06:55.932
By saying no

06:55.967 --> 06:59.067
constantly and consistently,
you empower yourself

06:59.102 --> 07:01.798
while simultaneously
turning any jerk

07:01.833 --> 07:04.800
into a submissive,
sniveling, puddle of a man.

07:04.835 --> 07:07.034
Hmm. And isn't that
every girl's dream?

07:07.069 --> 07:08.332
(chuckling)

07:08.367 --> 07:10.534
After the break, we're going
to talk about your new book,

07:10.569 --> 07:12.633
<i>Of Course You Don't Have
a Retirement Plan Yet-</i>

07:12.668 --> 07:15.833
<i>Take a Look at Yourself,
You Dumb Slut, due out in June.</i>

07:15.868 --> 07:17.734
We'll be right back.

07:17.769 --> 07:18.898
We're clear.

07:18.933 --> 07:20.332
You guys want
any coffee?

07:20.367 --> 07:22.100
Oh, you know what,
Mike, that'd be great.

07:22.135 --> 07:24.833
You?
No.

07:27.334 --> 07:29.234
What about you, Robin?
You dating anyone?

07:29.269 --> 07:30.299
Oh. (chuckles)

07:30.334 --> 07:33.000
Dating's not really my bag
right now.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.299
Uh-oh.

07:34.334 --> 07:36.032
Did somebody break your heart?

07:36.067 --> 07:37.534
And then,
I- I told her everything.

07:37.569 --> 07:38.499
It just came pouring out.

07:38.534 --> 07:40.132
And by the end of it,
she said...

07:40.167 --> 07:42.884
This Barney needs
to be taught a lesson.

07:42.919 --> 07:45.601
You say the word,
and I will destroy him.

07:45.636 --> 07:46.765
What do you mean?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.067
I can use the power
of "no"

07:49.102 --> 07:51.334
to break your friend, Barney.

07:51.369 --> 07:52.932
Just say the word.

07:52.967 --> 07:54.668
Come on, that-that stuff
doesn't really work,

07:54.703 --> 07:55.566
does it?

07:55.601 --> 07:57.065
I didn't know
what you wanted,

07:57.100 --> 07:59.967
so I got you a cappuccino,
an espresso, a latte, a decaf...

08:00.002 --> 08:01.165
Oh, hi, Robin.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.100
And this
is a Turkish coffee.

08:03.135 --> 08:04.718
Thank you, Mike.

08:04.753 --> 08:06.266
Think about it.

08:06.301 --> 08:08.367
<i>ROBIN: I didn't think I
was going to think about it,</i>

08:08.402 --> 08:09.765
<i>but then... I thought about it.</i>

08:09.800 --> 08:14.900
Oh, this Pilates instructor
was off the charts.

08:14.935 --> 08:18.933
Picture Robin,
but younger.

08:18.968 --> 08:20.765
And bigger boobs.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.501
Maybe not bigger,
but more shapely.

08:24.536 --> 08:26.666
And bigger.

08:26.701 --> 08:28.999
(phone rings)
Hello?

08:29.034 --> 08:30.434
BARNEY: I get her up
against the StairMaster,

08:30.469 --> 08:31.534
and we...
Do it.

08:31.569 --> 08:32.798
Spoilers.

08:32.832 --> 08:34.601
Anyway, we do it.

08:34.635 --> 08:35.734
It's done.

08:40.668 --> 08:41.967
Thank you, Mike.

08:43.634 --> 08:45.532
I know, it was stupid,

08:45.567 --> 08:46.666
but you have
to understand,

08:46.701 --> 08:48.501
back then,
I was still really upset

08:48.536 --> 08:49.633
about the breakup.

08:49.668 --> 08:51.467
I was going
though my mourning period.

08:51.502 --> 08:53.434
There was a lot of scotch
and a lot

08:53.469 --> 08:55.385
of long nights
at the shooting range.

08:55.420 --> 08:57.301
I hope those weren't
the same nights.

08:57.336 --> 08:58.499
ROBIN:
Geez, Lily.

08:58.534 --> 09:01.334
It's not like I remember
all of them.

09:01.369 --> 09:02.532
Hey, babe.

09:02.567 --> 09:03.599
Did you know that Robin

09:03.634 --> 09:05.232
was going through
a mourning period?

09:05.267 --> 09:07.000
I mean, she seemed fine
after the breakup.

09:07.035 --> 09:08.332
Oh, you know how she is.

09:08.367 --> 09:10.467
She tries to keep her emotions
to herself.

09:10.502 --> 09:12.567
But yeah, I caught her crying
a couple times.

09:12.602 --> 09:14.232
She cried?

09:14.267 --> 09:16.267
Like, real tears?

09:17.367 --> 09:19.867
But that means...

09:19.902 --> 09:21.332
Oh, no.

09:21.367 --> 09:23.167
<i>NARRATOR:
And then, Marshall realized</i>

09:23.202 --> 09:24.967
<i>what a jackass he had been
to Robin.</i>

09:25.002 --> 09:26.518
Exactly. Barney's
dating again,

09:26.553 --> 09:28.034
and he couldn't
be happier.

09:28.069 --> 09:29.299
I mean,

09:29.334 --> 09:33.034
that guy has been active.

09:33.069 --> 09:34.499
Sexually.

09:34.534 --> 09:36.000
I mean, he's just
been, like,

09:36.035 --> 09:39.434
bang, bang, bang!

09:39.469 --> 09:40.865
You know?

09:40.900 --> 09:42.733
(chuckling):
It's like...

09:42.768 --> 09:44.567
bang, bang, bang, bang,

09:44.602 --> 09:45.532
bang, bang!

09:45.567 --> 09:47.717
 Bang, bang, bang,
bangity bang 

09:47.752 --> 09:49.867
 I said a-bang, bang,
bangity bang 

09:49.902 --> 09:51.099
 Bang, bang, bang

09:51.134 --> 09:52.532
 Bang, bang,
bangity bang 

09:52.567 --> 09:54.534
 I said a-bang, bang,
bangity bang. 

09:54.569 --> 09:56.566
How could you
let me do that?

09:56.601 --> 09:58.768
You're my wife,
you're supposed to stop me

09:58.803 --> 10:01.085
from embarrassing myself
in public.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.367
I know, but that song's
kind of catchy.

10:03.402 --> 10:05.284
 Bang, bang, bangity bang

10:05.319 --> 10:07.132
 Bang, bang,
bangity bang 

10:07.167 --> 10:09.100
 I said bang, bang,
bangity bang 

10:09.135 --> 10:10.634
 A-bang, bang, bangity bang.

10:10.669 --> 10:12.532
Damn it.

10:12.567 --> 10:14.034
I've read that thing
cover to cover,

10:14.069 --> 10:15.434
and I can't find a loophole.

10:15.469 --> 10:17.165
What am I going to do?

10:17.200 --> 10:19.634
Well, there is one
other option, but, uh,

10:19.669 --> 10:22.332
nah, you're not ready.
Tell me.

10:22.367 --> 10:25.401
Well, if you have to seal
the deal in just one date,

10:25.436 --> 10:27.634
it's got to be one doozy
of a date, right?

10:27.669 --> 10:29.833
Yeah. I'm not talking
dinner and a movie.

10:29.868 --> 10:31.334
I'm not talking mini-golf.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.733
I'm talking...

10:32.768 --> 10:34.733
17 dates worth of romance

10:34.768 --> 10:37.601
wrapped up into one
incredible night.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.701
I'm talking about...

10:39.736 --> 10:41.202
a superdate.

10:41.237 --> 10:42.668
A superdate?

10:42.703 --> 10:43.865
Mm-hmm.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.932
That sounds kind of lame.

10:45.967 --> 10:47.566
What if we call it a megadate?

10:47.601 --> 10:49.501
If you want my help,
it's a superdate.

10:49.536 --> 10:51.152
All right.
Leave it to me.

10:51.187 --> 10:52.733
I'll plan the
whole thing.

10:52.768 --> 10:55.117
<i>You're going to plan
the whole thing? Mm-hmm.</i>

10:55.152 --> 10:57.467
I bet it'll be all gooey
and romantic, huh?

10:57.502 --> 10:59.251
Gooey and
romantic?

10:59.286 --> 11:01.000
Gooey and romantic?

11:01.035 --> 11:02.299
Barney...

11:02.334 --> 11:05.234
 You don't have
to take her 

11:05.269 --> 11:08.065
 To Paris or Peru

11:08.100 --> 11:11.099
Uh, Ted,
what are you doing?

11:11.134 --> 11:15.267
 You just have to
make her understand 

11:15.302 --> 11:17.200
Ted, people are
looking at us.

11:17.235 --> 11:21.167
 What she means to you

11:21.202 --> 11:22.299
Oh, God, really?

11:22.334 --> 11:24.100
You're really going
to do this right now?

11:24.135 --> 11:28.499
 On your superdate

11:28.534 --> 11:34.534
 Troubles of the world
will simply have to wait 

11:34.569 --> 11:38.301
 For wonders
and amazement 

11:38.336 --> 11:42.018
 Served upon a
silver plate 

11:42.053 --> 11:45.666
 Hurry up now,
don't be late 

11:45.701 --> 11:50.000
 'Cause hand in hand
you'll find a land 

11:52.800 --> 11:56.867
 Where paradise awaits

11:56.902 --> 11:58.884
(applause)

11:58.919 --> 12:00.832
And then boom!

12:00.867 --> 12:03.701
Fireworks over the
Manhattan skyline!

12:03.736 --> 12:05.832
You kiss her.

12:05.867 --> 12:13.301
 And that's your
superdate. 

12:19.601 --> 12:23.467
That sounds gooey
and romantic.

12:23.502 --> 12:25.634
Yeah.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.266
Strip club?
Strip club.

12:30.301 --> 12:33.467
<i>NARRATOR: Finally, the night
of the big dates arrived.</i>

12:33.502 --> 12:35.351
So, tonight's
the big night.

12:35.386 --> 12:37.165
Where's the D-bag taking you?

12:37.200 --> 12:38.434
That's not a good nickname
for Don.

12:38.469 --> 12:39.432
I'll think of a better one.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.034
You know, that, I just...
I canceled.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.301
What do you mean you... Wait.

12:45.336 --> 12:46.568
Hey.
Hey.

12:46.603 --> 12:47.765
What's wrong?

12:47.800 --> 12:48.798
Robin canceled her date.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.734
What? She was totally
psyched for it

12:50.769 --> 12:52.834
like an hour ago.

12:52.869 --> 12:54.865
Robin Scherbatsky.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.400
You look like
the classiest,

12:57.435 --> 12:59.900
most expensive prostitute ever.

12:59.935 --> 13:01.299
Oh, thank you.

13:01.334 --> 13:04.501
I take it you're excited
to go out with Don?

13:04.536 --> 13:06.000
You know what? I kinda am.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.367
Don't tell Marshall.

13:07.402 --> 13:08.266
I won't.

13:08.301 --> 13:09.634
I bet you'll have
a nice time tonight.

13:09.669 --> 13:10.733
Yeah.

13:10.768 --> 13:11.965
Not, however, a super time.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.567
A super time will be had
by Barney

13:14.602 --> 13:15.933
on his date with Anita.

13:15.968 --> 13:17.065
Yep.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.334
<i>Carriage ride, dinner at
Le Tombeur des Culottes.</i>

13:21.100 --> 13:24.267
They're calling it
a superdate, so.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.065
Ted!

13:26.100 --> 13:27.733
How could you do that?!

13:27.768 --> 13:30.201
Robin just got over
her mourning period!

13:30.236 --> 13:32.634
She seemed so happy
after the breakup.

13:32.669 --> 13:33.832
Oh, Ted.

13:33.867 --> 13:35.167
So unobservant.

13:35.202 --> 13:36.432
Such a guy.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.817
She was obviously crushed.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.167
Wait, but that would mean...

13:41.202 --> 13:42.898
Oh, no.

13:42.933 --> 13:46.034
<i>NARRATOR: And then I realized
what a jackass I'd been to Robin.</i>

13:46.069 --> 13:47.800
 I said a-bang, bang,
bangity bang 

13:47.835 --> 13:48.965
Hey, whatcha singing?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.266
Oh, just a little
ditty I wrote

13:50.301 --> 13:51.800
about how many girls
Barney's been banging lately.

13:51.835 --> 13:53.668
Well, count me in
for a verse. Great.

13:53.703 --> 13:55.832
 Bang, bang, bangity bang

13:55.867 --> 13:57.668
 I said a-bang, bang,
bangity bang 

13:57.703 --> 13:58.599
 Bang, bang, bang

13:58.634 --> 14:00.050
 Bang, bang, bangity bang

14:00.085 --> 14:01.467
 I said a-bang, bang...

14:01.502 --> 14:02.666
No!

14:02.701 --> 14:04.366
Oh, God. Where is she?

14:04.401 --> 14:06.334
I think she's in
the restroom.

14:06.369 --> 14:07.765
(crying)

14:07.800 --> 14:09.867
(all aahing)
No, guys, guys,

14:09.902 --> 14:11.366
I'm fine, I'm fine.

14:11.401 --> 14:13.668
(knocking on door)
(whistling)

14:14.867 --> 14:16.067
Hey.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.432
Dude.

14:20.467 --> 14:22.550
Why would you do that?

14:22.585 --> 14:24.634
Because I'm angry at you.

14:24.669 --> 14:26.151
I'm angry at me.

14:26.186 --> 14:27.599
I'm angry at Ted.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.867
And frankly,
I'm still angry at the Empire.

14:29.902 --> 14:31.965
Why are you angry at me?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.217
Dude, you've been a real
jerk in front of Robin

14:34.252 --> 14:36.434
while she's been going
through her mourning period.

14:36.469 --> 14:37.666
Mourning period?

14:37.701 --> 14:39.534
She hasn't been going through
any mourning period.

14:39.569 --> 14:41.368
(sighs)
So unobservant.

14:41.403 --> 14:43.132
Such a guy.
Ugh, Barney,

14:43.167 --> 14:45.483
sit down,
you need to hear some stuff.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.800
What-what, is she
upset or something?

14:47.835 --> 14:49.165
Of course she's upset.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.266
Take a look at yourself,
you dumb slut.

14:51.301 --> 14:55.367
<i>NARRATOR: And then Aunt Lily told
Barney every excruciating detail</i>

14:55.402 --> 14:57.768
<i>of what he hadn't been seeing
since the breakup.</i>

14:57.803 --> 14:59.818
You should've
seen this girl.

14:59.853 --> 15:01.833
Bang, ping,
pa-dow, ga-donk.

15:01.868 --> 15:02.734
Okay, I'm leaving.

15:02.769 --> 15:05.165
So...

15:05.200 --> 15:07.401
we get up
to my place...

15:09.234 --> 15:11.401
(crying)

15:12.301 --> 15:14.034
(people cheering on TV)

15:19.067 --> 15:21.267
(sniffling)

15:22.833 --> 15:24.833

 Bang, bang, bang...

15:34.267 --> 15:37.800
(vomiting)

15:40.301 --> 15:42.167
I can't believe
Robin's been so upset.

15:42.467 --> 15:45.467
I can't believe you threw up
in your Stormtrooper helmet.

15:45.502 --> 15:47.198
Eh. I did something worse in it

15:47.233 --> 15:49.267
<i>after The Phantom Menace
premiere.</i>

15:50.334 --> 15:54.267
So, she's been this way
ever since we broke up?

15:54.302 --> 15:55.666
Actually, she was
doing much better

15:55.701 --> 15:58.867
until you decided to go on this
stupid superdate with Anita.

15:58.902 --> 16:00.098
And now she's

16:00.133 --> 16:02.667
off sulking God
knows where.

16:02.702 --> 16:04.867
I know where.

16:07.001 --> 16:09.167
(sighs)

16:12.167 --> 16:13.599
Hey.
Hey.

16:13.634 --> 16:15.566
Barney, what's up?
(sniffling)

16:15.601 --> 16:18.968
Thought you were, um,
going on some big date.

16:19.003 --> 16:20.867
Robin, I know you're upset.

16:20.902 --> 16:22.699
What? No.

16:22.734 --> 16:24.968
I- I-I have...
I've never been happier.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.667
And-and this Anita
sounds lovely.

16:27.702 --> 16:29.967
I am so glad
that you two just...

16:30.002 --> 16:32.233
randomly happened
to find each other.

16:32.268 --> 16:34.467
It just warms my frickin' heart.

16:34.502 --> 16:36.500
(heavy breathing)

16:36.535 --> 16:37.933
Ah.

16:37.968 --> 16:39.717
(gun clicks)

16:39.752 --> 16:41.609
(grunts)

16:41.644 --> 16:43.432
(sighs)

16:43.467 --> 16:45.217
So, you sure
you're not upset?

16:45.252 --> 16:46.968
Of course I'm upset, Barney.

16:47.003 --> 16:48.065
Don't you see

16:48.100 --> 16:50.399
how constantly talking
about your conquests

16:50.434 --> 16:53.034
makes me feel like I'm just
another number to you?

16:53.069 --> 16:55.068
But you're not just
another number to me.

16:55.103 --> 16:57.535
You know, and-and now
you're taking Anita,

16:57.570 --> 16:59.968
who you barely know,
on this amazing date,

17:00.003 --> 17:02.601
when I never got treated
that way.

17:03.267 --> 17:04.965
It just...

17:05.001 --> 17:06.200
it just sucks, that's all.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.733
It just sucks.

17:07.769 --> 17:09.901
(sighs)

17:14.166 --> 17:16.132
Wow.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.017
I knew I was bad
at being a boyfriend,

17:18.051 --> 17:19.867
but I had no idea
I'd be so much worse

17:19.902 --> 17:22.068
at being an ex-boyfriend.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.732
I'm sorry.

17:26.767 --> 17:29.567
What can I do to make it up
to you?

17:29.602 --> 17:31.432
Nothing, Barney.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.400
You've-you've already proven
that I'm not important to you.

17:34.435 --> 17:36.068
Stop that, I'm serious.

17:36.103 --> 17:37.701
Ask me for anything.

17:37.736 --> 17:39.198
Uh, okay.

17:39.233 --> 17:41.400
Um... don't sleep with Anita.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.384
Done.

17:42.419 --> 17:43.299
Barney,

17:43.334 --> 17:44.632
of course you're going to sleep
with her.

17:44.667 --> 17:47.534
Why else would you be taking her
on this superdate?

17:47.569 --> 17:50.267
She's not going
on the superdate, Robin.

17:50.302 --> 17:52.434
You are.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.832

18:09.701 --> 18:12.367
Well, I'm-I'm breaking
all my rules coming down here,

18:12.402 --> 18:14.767
but nobody stands me up
like that.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.801
So, are we going out or what?

18:16.836 --> 18:18.599
I'm sorry.

18:18.634 --> 18:21.133
I... I made a promise
to a friend.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.334
I have to say no.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.165
Oh. Oh, I see.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.500
You're trying the "no" thing
on me.

18:31.334 --> 18:32.667
You really think
that's going to work?

18:33.434 --> 18:34.634
'Cause it won't.

18:35.467 --> 18:36.550
Okay, how about this.

18:36.585 --> 18:37.634
I'll cut you a deal.

18:37.669 --> 18:39.566
Maybe...

18:39.601 --> 18:41.950
you might get lucky

18:41.985 --> 18:44.300
after the 12th date.

18:44.335 --> 18:45.365
No.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.483
The 11th date.
No.

18:46.518 --> 18:47.559
Fifth date.
No.

18:47.594 --> 18:48.566
Tonight.
No.

18:48.601 --> 18:50.400
Tonight before dinner.
(strained): No.

18:50.435 --> 18:51.867
How about you?
You interested.

18:51.902 --> 18:53.832
Yeah.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.450
Come on, Barney.

18:55.485 --> 18:57.059
I'm sorry, Anita.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.634
The answer is no.

18:58.669 --> 19:00.599
Well, good.

19:00.634 --> 19:03.133
Because my answer is no, too.

19:05.467 --> 19:07.133
Okay, here's my final offer.

19:22.988 --> 19:24.167
Barney!

19:37.734 --> 19:39.632
And that's my story.

19:39.667 --> 19:42.767
Well, here's a $500 ticket
for jumping in the river.

19:42.802 --> 19:44.334
I hope it was worth it.

19:49.267 --> 19:51.834
(fireworks popping)

20:00.589 --> 20:02.523
I hope so, too.

20:22.334 --> 20:23.500
It's an old
wives' tale.

20:23.535 --> 20:24.634
Oh, hey, Robin.

20:24.669 --> 20:25.599
Hey.

20:25.634 --> 20:26.667
How did the big date go?

20:26.702 --> 20:29.033
Uh, pretty well.

20:29.068 --> 20:31.117
Pretty, uh, pretty well.

20:31.152 --> 20:33.142
Like how "pretty well"?

20:33.177 --> 20:35.133
Oh, guys, guys, come on.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.098
It was fine.

20:37.133 --> 20:39.133
You know, it was nice.

20:39.168 --> 20:41.118
We had a good time.

20:41.153 --> 20:43.033
Let's just, uh...

20:43.068 --> 20:45.001
let's just leave it
at that, okay.

20:46.834 --> 20:47.899
Although, um,

20:47.934 --> 20:50.334
one interesting thing,
uh, did happen.

20:50.369 --> 20:52.351
 I said a-bang, bang,
bangity bang 

20:52.386 --> 20:54.299
 I said a-bang,
bang, bangity bang 

20:54.334 --> 20:56.867
 A-bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang, bangity bang 

20:56.902 --> 20:59.265
 I said a-bang, bang,
bangity bang 

20:59.300 --> 21:01.267
 Bang, bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang, bang 

21:01.302 --> 21:03.367
 Bang, bang, bangity bang...
