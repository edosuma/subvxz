[suspenseful music playing]

00:48.631 --> 00:52.381
So, in conclusion,
I would just like to say,

00:52.465 --> 00:56.048
please, please, please, please,
please, please, please! Oh, come on!

00:56.131 --> 00:57.506
Let humans live here.

00:58.090 --> 00:59.798
Now, let me get this straight.

00:59.881 --> 01:02.381
These humans destroy their own planet.

01:02.465 --> 01:03.715
Not on purpose!

01:03.798 --> 01:06.715
And sent a bunch of dogs into space

01:06.798 --> 01:08.215
to find them a new one.

01:08.298 --> 01:10.215
Genetically enhanced dogs!

01:10.298 --> 01:13.131
They experimented on you? Barbaric!

01:13.215 --> 01:16.298
Hey, they were successful. Look! Thumbs.

01:16.548 --> 01:20.131
Hmm. And why would
we want to share with them?

01:20.840 --> 01:23.756
Well, uh, humans
won't want to "share" share.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.548
They're kind of used to being in charge.

01:25.631 --> 01:28.048
[retches, chomps]

01:28.131 --> 01:31.173
But you can be
their best friends, just like dogs.

01:31.256 --> 01:33.215
Sure, you might have to
get neutered, too, but--

01:33.298 --> 01:35.256
I think we'll pass.

01:35.340 --> 01:38.381
Okay. I think I know
how to persuade you. Whoa!

01:38.756 --> 01:40.590
[sizzles]

01:41.715 --> 01:43.131
[all screeching]

01:43.215 --> 01:45.465
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

01:48.548 --> 01:49.673
[screeches]

01:49.756 --> 01:52.756
[grunts] Captain,
I just think it would've been

01:52.840 --> 01:54.756
really nice to have one mission...

01:54.840 --> 01:56.673
[grunt] ...not end in
a shoot-out, you know?

01:56.756 --> 01:59.423
I agree, Stella. It's not my fault

01:59.506 --> 02:02.423
these guys don't know
the fine art of negotiating.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.381
What happened this time?

02:06.465 --> 02:09.423
I was gonna give them
my blaster to sweeten the deal.

02:09.506 --> 02:13.215
It's customized with a grappling hook
and a glow in the dark lightning bolt.

02:13.298 --> 02:15.840
Who wouldn't want this? Ow! Hot!

02:18.173 --> 02:20.548
Maybe let someone else
do the negotiating next time?

02:20.673 --> 02:22.465
But I love doing the talking.

02:22.548 --> 02:24.881
Well, that's exactly the problem.

02:24.965 --> 02:26.173
[continues shrieking]

02:26.256 --> 02:28.215
Garbage to Chonies.
Any luck with that door?

02:29.006 --> 02:32.215
Still working on it, Captain.
It's highly encrypted. [grunts]

02:32.423 --> 02:33.923
Just hurry up, please!

02:38.756 --> 02:40.090
Chonies! Look out!

02:42.965 --> 02:47.298
Ha. Technology one, alien zero... Whoa!

02:48.881 --> 02:50.923
-Whoa!
-I'll save you!

02:51.173 --> 02:52.798
[grunting]

02:53.965 --> 02:56.881
Ugh! Dumb advanced alien tech!

02:56.965 --> 02:58.965
Does anyone else know how to hack this?

02:59.881 --> 03:03.215
[laughs] Being smart's for idiots!

03:03.631 --> 03:04.965
We're free! Whoa!

03:05.631 --> 03:07.006
Stella to M-Bark. Loaf,

03:07.090 --> 03:08.506
we're gonna need a new escape route.

03:08.590 --> 03:10.631
Go left? Wait, my left.

03:10.715 --> 03:12.715
Stage left. I don't know! Keep going left.

03:12.798 --> 03:14.798
Oh, wait, that's just a circle.

03:14.881 --> 03:16.631
You're running in a circle. I'm sorry!

03:16.715 --> 03:18.631
Just run away from the aliens!

03:19.548 --> 03:20.798
[disappointedly] Never mind.

03:21.381 --> 03:23.048
Hey. Where's Ed?

03:23.631 --> 03:25.173
[sniffing]

03:28.006 --> 03:29.506
Oh! Gold.

03:29.590 --> 03:31.381
This stuff's worth its weight in gold.

03:31.465 --> 03:33.631
Ed! Now is not the time to loot!

03:33.715 --> 03:36.715
Now is the perfect time to loot,
everyone's distracted-- [grunts]

03:36.798 --> 03:39.798
Okay. Nomi, you flank them
from the left and I'll... Nomi?

03:39.881 --> 03:42.506
[screaming, laughing maniacally]

03:43.340 --> 03:46.131
-Pew, pew, pew, pew!
-[exhale] You saved my life, kid.

03:46.298 --> 03:48.881
-Here, I want you to have this.
-Aww, you shouldn't...

03:48.965 --> 03:51.090
Hey, this is mine!

03:51.173 --> 03:53.923
And now, it's yours. Forever.

03:54.006 --> 03:56.673
[screaming]

03:59.340 --> 04:00.756
Chonies! Now!

04:01.506 --> 04:04.090
-Whoa!
-[both screams]

04:11.965 --> 04:15.506
Get to the Pluto.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

04:15.590 --> 04:18.090
-You heard the Captain. To the ship!
-[Captain Garbage] No! Wait.

04:18.173 --> 04:19.590
Wait! I might not be fine!

04:19.673 --> 04:21.256
[hysterically]
Worry about me! Worry about me!

04:21.340 --> 04:23.923
Well, he also told us
to worry about him, I--

04:24.006 --> 04:26.465
-Trust me, he'll be fine.
-[grunting]

04:28.881 --> 04:29.965
[grunts]

04:30.048 --> 04:32.756
[groans] My loot!

04:33.340 --> 04:36.590
My loot! [sobbing]

04:36.673 --> 04:38.340
[continues shrieking]

04:40.756 --> 04:45.423
I just want to remind you guys that
I would've happily given you this blaster.

04:46.965 --> 04:50.173
Woo! [laughs, grunts]

04:50.256 --> 04:52.881
Well, if you'll excuse...

04:52.965 --> 04:54.256
[screeching]

04:54.340 --> 04:57.590
Okay, okay. Before you kill me,

04:57.673 --> 04:59.923
you gotta admit that move
I just did was awesome.

05:06.923 --> 05:09.506
[grunts, screams]

05:09.590 --> 05:11.006
[groans, gasps]

05:11.090 --> 05:12.965
[screaming]

05:15.340 --> 05:18.090
-[grunts]
-Hup-up-up! What's it worth to you?

05:18.173 --> 05:20.465
[gasps]

05:21.006 --> 05:22.673
-Ed!
-[grunting] Ed!

05:22.756 --> 05:25.590
Okay, fine. But you owe me one.

05:27.881 --> 05:29.756
[shrieks]

05:33.215 --> 05:35.381
[all panting]

05:37.048 --> 05:40.590
Okay. So, how do we feel about the planet?

05:41.215 --> 05:42.631
Suitable for humans, right?

05:43.715 --> 05:45.048
What?

05:45.131 --> 05:47.340
We could at least put it down as a maybe.

05:48.465 --> 05:49.840
Ugh, fine!

05:52.590 --> 05:54.631
[whooshing]

05:57.256 --> 05:58.548
[beeps]

06:00.881 --> 06:03.798
Come on, Garbage! Attaboy! [laughs]

06:05.673 --> 06:07.881
[inhales sharply, exhales]

06:11.631 --> 06:13.715
Chelsea, it's me, Garbage.

06:13.798 --> 06:16.881
Not that you'd forget or anything.
[chuckles nervously] That's unlikely.

06:17.590 --> 06:21.590
Anyway, um, I'm afraid
the Creepicheep planet didn't work out,

06:21.673 --> 06:25.340
but don't worry. The next planet's
going to be the one. I know it.

06:25.423 --> 06:27.340
-[static crackles]
-Nomi to Captain.

06:27.423 --> 06:29.756
Just seen something through the windshield
we need you to look at.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.465
-Over.
-[static crackles]

06:31.548 --> 06:35.298
I'll fetch you and all humanity
an awesome new home,

06:35.381 --> 06:38.423
and you're going to see just how right
you were to put your faith in me.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.465
[sighs] I hope these messages
are reaching you, but--

06:41.548 --> 06:44.006
-[static crackles]
-Nomi to Captain.

06:44.090 --> 06:47.506
Question. Is it technically
a windshield if we're in space?

06:47.798 --> 06:51.048
-There isn't any wind. Over.
-[static crackles]

06:51.131 --> 06:54.965
But I guess they're not
because you'd have replied.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.006
-[static crackles]
-Nomi to Captain.

06:57.090 --> 06:59.590
We're having an argument
about the windshield thing, and I--

06:59.673 --> 07:03.298
-[Stella] Of course it's a windshield...
-[Ed] But it shields us from space.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.465
-Yeah, we really need your input. Over.
-[Stella] Ed!

07:07.131 --> 07:10.506
Did I... Did I press the button?
Oh. [mimics static] Over.

07:11.006 --> 07:12.298
Garbage to crew.

07:12.381 --> 07:15.423
Just hold on a minute for
the love of belly rubs!

07:16.590 --> 07:17.881
Sorry. [sighs]

07:17.965 --> 07:21.465
Anyway, uh, I love you and I miss you,

07:21.548 --> 07:23.798
and I hope you miss me.

07:24.631 --> 07:26.631
[panicking] Don't get a new dog!

07:26.715 --> 07:28.131
Okay. Bye.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.381
[sighs]

07:37.256 --> 07:38.923
[coughs, chokes]

07:40.090 --> 07:43.881
Okay, I've thought about it
and it's definitely a space shield...

07:44.798 --> 07:46.131
Wow.

07:49.881 --> 07:52.131
It looks... perfect.

07:52.340 --> 07:56.048
It might be. The scan suggests
a climate similar to Earth,

07:56.256 --> 08:00.840
but it isn't showing up on the
M-Bark's mapping systems, which is...

08:00.923 --> 08:02.756
[nervously] ...kind of spooky.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.673
[gasps] It's a ghost planet.

08:05.756 --> 08:09.465
-There's no such thing as ghosts.
-That's what they want you to think.

08:09.631 --> 08:12.673
Wait, so this place
hasn't been investigated?

08:12.756 --> 08:14.298
It's just here?

08:14.381 --> 08:16.881
Ed hasn't been investigated
and he's just here.

08:16.965 --> 08:19.506
What? Uh, investigated? [chuckles] Me?

08:19.590 --> 08:22.215
[stammers] What crimes? I'm a saint!

08:24.798 --> 08:26.965
Similar to Earth.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.340
This is it. This has gotta be it!

08:29.423 --> 08:33.131
-Nomi, set a course for this planet--
-[beeping]

08:33.215 --> 08:36.423
Darn it! Chonies, please tell me
we have enough fuel to get there!

08:36.506 --> 08:39.381
Yes, Captain.
We have enough fuel to get there.

08:39.465 --> 08:43.423
-Terrific. Nomi, set a course--
-But that's not true.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.840
-Why did you lie to me, Chonies?
-You just told me to!

08:47.006 --> 08:49.381
Argh! Fine! Mark it on the map.

08:49.465 --> 08:51.756
We're coming back for this planet.

08:53.090 --> 08:55.131
[whooshing]

09:17.756 --> 09:20.840
-[all grunting, screaming]
-[Ed] Watch it!

09:21.631 --> 09:23.673
[laughs] My ship!

09:23.756 --> 09:25.506
[Nomi] It's not my fault
we're out of fuel!

09:35.423 --> 09:36.798
[groans]

09:42.048 --> 09:45.215
How was your mission, Garbage?
Another embarrassing failure?

09:45.298 --> 09:49.215
No, it wasn't an embarrassing failure,
Captain Happy.

09:49.298 --> 09:52.048
-Yeah, it was just a regular failure.
-Exactly.

09:52.131 --> 09:54.006
I wasn't embarrassed at all.

09:54.090 --> 09:58.006
Besides, every mission
you've done is technically a failure, too.

09:58.090 --> 10:00.673
You haven't found a new Earth. [gasp]

10:01.048 --> 10:03.881
Actually, the indigenous species
gave us some leads

10:03.965 --> 10:06.590
on potentially suitable
planets in the quadrant,

10:06.673 --> 10:09.840
and also gift bags, so,
that feels successful to me.

10:09.923 --> 10:12.173
Captain, you're alive!

10:12.256 --> 10:16.090
Uh, I mean, congratulations on not dying.

10:16.840 --> 10:20.423
[groans] The Council wants to see you.

10:20.506 --> 10:21.923
-Don't worry.
-[gasps]

10:22.006 --> 10:24.548
It won't be a bad meeting, for me.

10:25.423 --> 10:28.840
Come along, former Captain Gar...
Oh. [chuckles] Silly me.

10:28.923 --> 10:31.006
-Getting ahead of myself.
-[snarling]

10:36.673 --> 10:38.673
Random security pat-down!

10:38.756 --> 10:40.715
Gotta check you for alien parasites.

10:40.798 --> 10:43.256
Oh yeah? Why is that, Jerry? [chuckles]

10:43.340 --> 10:46.340
Are you looking for friends
on your intellectual level? [grunts]

10:46.423 --> 10:49.590
More like I'm trying
to convince you to take a shower.

10:49.673 --> 10:52.381
Garbage by name, garbage by stink.

10:52.465 --> 10:55.798
Well, at least
I don't stink of loneliness.

10:55.881 --> 10:58.298
I'm not lonely! I'm just alone!

10:58.381 --> 11:01.131
[laughter]

11:01.215 --> 11:03.423
And then when they found out
I was a member of the Council,

11:03.506 --> 11:06.090
they gave me gift bags for you as well.

11:06.173 --> 11:07.756
-[laughs] Well, yeah, I mean.
-[all chuckling]

11:07.840 --> 11:10.423
Ah, no, no, please,
just diplomacy, really.

11:11.298 --> 11:13.798
Captain Garbage, mission report,

11:13.881 --> 11:16.215
and gift bags, if you have them.

11:16.465 --> 11:18.256
Swag bags, some folks call them.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.506
Uh. Well, I don't have gift bags--

11:22.590 --> 11:24.923
-Ooh. [whispering disapprovingly]
-That's disappointing.

11:25.881 --> 11:29.006
But my mission was immensely successful.

11:29.090 --> 11:32.506
I efficiently ruled out
an unsuitable planet in record time.

11:32.590 --> 11:34.506
[coughs] Hmm. [chuckles]

11:34.590 --> 11:37.048
Was it unsuitable before you arrived?

11:37.631 --> 11:41.465
Look, they didn't understand why
I was reaching for my blaster, and--

11:41.548 --> 11:42.923
-[all groaning]
-[thuds]

11:43.006 --> 11:46.673
Might these aliens seek revenge
and attack the M-Bark?

11:46.756 --> 11:50.840
Well, I'd like to see them try!

11:50.923 --> 11:52.923
Excuse me for a moment. [growls]

11:53.006 --> 11:55.923
[toy squeaking]

11:57.256 --> 11:59.298
-Please continue.
-Garbage,

11:59.381 --> 12:02.131
for the past 14 dog years,

12:02.215 --> 12:04.840
your missions have always gone a little...

12:05.631 --> 12:09.381
-disastrously.
-Oh, come on, that's...

12:13.923 --> 12:17.215
fair. But that's the kind of Captain I am.

12:17.298 --> 12:20.215
A risk-taking rogue
who plays by his own rules,

12:20.298 --> 12:21.923
and then breaks those rules.

12:22.006 --> 12:26.006
Captain, the rules are there
to ensure every dog has its day,

12:26.090 --> 12:29.048
as in, literally survives for the day.

12:29.131 --> 12:30.798
Noted. Anyway,

12:30.881 --> 12:32.923
the next planet's
not going to find itself.

12:33.006 --> 12:34.840
So, if you'll excuse m...

12:34.923 --> 12:37.590
Captain, we know you mean well,

12:37.673 --> 12:40.215
but you have to actually do well, too.

12:40.298 --> 12:43.923
Therefore, we're suspending you
and your crew from duty

12:44.006 --> 12:46.798
-until--
-No! You gotta let me back out! I--

12:46.881 --> 12:48.340
This is temporary.

12:48.423 --> 12:51.631
The Council must discuss
whether you're fit to be a Captain.

12:51.715 --> 12:54.840
Until then, you must stay on the M-Bark.

12:54.923 --> 12:56.548
-But--
-Stay.

12:56.631 --> 12:59.048
Stay. Stay.

12:59.590 --> 13:00.673
Lie down.

13:05.381 --> 13:07.173
[all laughing]

13:10.506 --> 13:13.090
-[monitor crackles]
-Earth is counting on you.

13:13.173 --> 13:17.965
And so are your humans.
Your undying loyalty to humanity

13:18.048 --> 13:21.923
is why your species was chosen
for this crucial mission.

13:22.006 --> 13:25.215
Find us a new planet,
and bring its location back,

13:25.298 --> 13:28.423
like a giant cosmic game of fetch.

13:28.506 --> 13:31.548
Your owners miss you,
and we know you miss them.

13:31.631 --> 13:33.340
You are their last hope.

13:33.756 --> 13:37.423
The Planetary Relocation
And Terraforming Syndicate

13:37.506 --> 13:39.631
thanks you for your service.

13:39.715 --> 13:43.381
[both together]
And remember, you're good dogs!

13:43.465 --> 13:44.756
P.R.A.T.S.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.590
A REAL DOG'S DINER

13:48.590 --> 13:51.090
[chanting] Ed! Ed! Ed! Ed! Ed! Ed!

13:52.840 --> 13:54.715
[sighs]

13:57.923 --> 13:59.173
Great news.

13:59.256 --> 14:02.548
The Council was so impressed
with how we handled the mish,

14:02.631 --> 14:05.173
we've been given time off.

14:05.256 --> 14:06.298
[gasps]

14:07.923 --> 14:10.548
-We've been suspended, haven't we?
-Yes,

14:10.631 --> 14:12.965
but I have a plan to un-suspend us.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.506
Is it obeying commands?

14:15.590 --> 14:18.965
If by obeying commands,
you mean defying them, then, yes.

14:19.048 --> 14:20.631
Why would that be what I mean?

14:20.715 --> 14:22.965
We gotta go check out that planet
we saw through the windshield.

14:23.048 --> 14:24.298
[Ed] It's a space shield.

14:24.381 --> 14:27.506
Whatever! I bet you it's the planet
we've been searching for.

14:27.590 --> 14:30.423
We fly there,
we prove it's good for humans,

14:30.506 --> 14:32.631
we come back heroes!

14:32.715 --> 14:34.715
[heroic music playing]

14:36.340 --> 14:39.506
Garbage, if it wasn't
for your rule-breaking,

14:39.590 --> 14:41.423
we'd all be dead.

14:41.506 --> 14:44.840
We can't thank you enough,
but we're gonna try.

14:45.173 --> 14:47.215
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

14:47.298 --> 14:49.756
Ooh, thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

14:49.840 --> 14:53.715
And as punishment
for Happy's refusal to trust you...

14:56.673 --> 14:57.840
[barking]

15:01.298 --> 15:04.381
Captain, for someone so good
at improvising without a plan,

15:04.465 --> 15:07.340
-this is a brilliant plan.
-Thank you, Chonies.

15:07.506 --> 15:11.298
We are with you 1,000%, Captain!

15:11.381 --> 15:12.631
What's the plan again?

15:12.715 --> 15:17.090
Garbage, it might not be the right planet.
It didn't even show up on the scanners.

15:17.173 --> 15:19.923
What if it's a space mirage?
Or, or, or a bounty hunter trap?

15:20.006 --> 15:22.173
I can't deal with this kind of stress!

15:22.256 --> 15:25.423
I'm not sure you can deal
with any kind of stress.

15:25.506 --> 15:27.715
Garbage. You'll lose your Captain's chair

15:27.798 --> 15:30.256
and any chance to find Earth
a new planet if they notice.

15:32.048 --> 15:33.215
But what if

15:33.298 --> 15:36.548
they don't realize
the Captain's gone? Hmm?

15:36.631 --> 15:38.381
[suspenseful music playing]

15:41.923 --> 15:45.840
Hmm. You gotta admit, I look
way better in your clothes than you do.

15:45.923 --> 15:48.465
And now, for the finishing touch.

15:49.965 --> 15:52.590
Holo-disguise! Nice work, Chonies!

15:54.298 --> 15:57.131
[gasps, chuckles nervously]

15:57.215 --> 15:59.548
[grunting, coughing]

16:00.673 --> 16:02.631
Loaf, make sure we don't miss our window

16:02.715 --> 16:05.048
to get back to the M-Bark
before it goes out of range,

16:05.131 --> 16:07.881
or we'll be stranded,
floating in space forever until we die.

16:07.965 --> 16:09.756
This is so much pressure.
It's making me sweat.

16:09.840 --> 16:12.465
I don't even have sweat glands.
How am I sweating?

16:14.131 --> 16:16.590
I'm kind of surprised
you're with us on this.

16:16.673 --> 16:19.923
Well, if it's a choice between
feeling guilty about disobeying orders

16:20.006 --> 16:23.131
or feeling guilty about
your certain death without me,

16:23.215 --> 16:25.631
um... [inhales sharply]

16:25.715 --> 16:28.631
-Uh...
-You're a good friend, Stella.

16:28.715 --> 16:30.423
Let's disobey orders!

16:38.465 --> 16:39.798
[sighing in relief]

16:39.881 --> 16:41.506
-[Happy] Garbage.
-[both gasp]

16:41.590 --> 16:42.965
Why are you in the hangar?

16:43.048 --> 16:46.548
Oh, just hangar-ing out.
[chuckles nervously]

16:47.215 --> 16:49.006
-[yelps]
-[sniffing]

16:49.090 --> 16:52.465
You smell different.
And what's with your voice?

16:52.548 --> 16:55.631
Nothing. Maybe there's
something wrong with your ears.

16:57.548 --> 16:58.548
[Happy] Hmph.

16:59.006 --> 17:01.381
I know you'll disobey orders, Captain.

17:01.798 --> 17:03.381
-[whimpers]
-You can't help yourself.

17:03.465 --> 17:05.173
And when I catch you,

17:05.256 --> 17:07.673
-you're done.
-[squeaks]

17:10.090 --> 17:11.840
-[groans]
-[gasps]

17:14.756 --> 17:16.131
[whistling]

17:21.673 --> 17:23.881
[crackling]

17:24.298 --> 17:25.923
Uh, Captain?

17:26.006 --> 17:27.673
Something in the planet's atmosphere

17:27.756 --> 17:30.506
is disrupting all communications
with the M-Bark.

17:30.673 --> 17:32.131
It's fine.

17:32.215 --> 17:35.215
I mean, it's not like we want them
to know where we are anyway, right?

17:35.298 --> 17:37.673
-Take us down, Nomi.
-Yes, Captain.

18:01.048 --> 18:03.840
[Chonies] Captain, my scanner's
picking up a transmission.

18:08.215 --> 18:10.423
This is exploratory Captain Kira.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.965
Attempt 38 to contact Earth.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.465
I have yet to receive any return messages.

18:15.548 --> 18:17.673
I'm beginning to wonder
if you're looking for me at all.

18:18.381 --> 18:20.965
Is that a dog?

18:21.048 --> 18:24.506
[nervously] You wouldn't just
leave me out in space, right?

18:25.090 --> 18:27.715
Man's best friend?
Of course you're trying to find me.

18:27.798 --> 18:30.840
Anyone from Earth,
from P.R.A.T.S., please respond.

18:30.923 --> 18:32.548
I crash landed in...

18:33.048 --> 18:35.131
Whoa, whoa, whoa! P.R.A.T.S. Center?

18:35.215 --> 18:39.298
Captain, this transmission,
it's more than a dog-decade old.

18:39.506 --> 18:42.506
[whispers] Ghost planet. I called it.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.923
Come on. Let's see what this is all about.

18:45.006 --> 18:46.256
Stay close.

18:54.590 --> 18:56.048
[sniffing]

18:59.923 --> 19:02.173
-[all gasp]
-[Stella] It's a P.R.A.T.S. shuttle.

19:03.256 --> 19:04.506
-Follow me.
-Garbage!

19:04.590 --> 19:07.256
-Be careful, this might be a trap.
-I am the trap!

19:07.840 --> 19:09.131
Ugh! Come on!

19:11.173 --> 19:13.048
-[Stella groans]
-[gasps]

19:22.215 --> 19:24.256
Yeah, you're the trap all right.

19:24.340 --> 19:26.215
Oh, poop.

19:26.965 --> 19:29.506
[outro theme music playing]
