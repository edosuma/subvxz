<i>In the '60's,</i>

01:19.920 --> 01:21.754
<i>a soulful and
brooding singer-songwriter</i>

01:21.888 --> 01:24.125
<i>named Micky Adams burst
from the folk scene</i>

01:24.257 --> 01:27.560
<i>and onto the pop charts
with a string of hits.</i>

01:27.694 --> 01:29.996
<i>By the early '70's,
he was a legend.</i>

01:30.131 --> 01:33.266
<i>Critics were comparing his
lyrics to Baudelaire's poetry.</i>

01:34.402 --> 01:39.040
<i>By 1973, Micky Adams
had won eleven Grammys.</i>

01:39.173 --> 01:43.844
<i>By 1974, he had sold over
70 million records.</i>

01:43.977 --> 01:49.115
<i>And by 1975, he was
off-the-grid: a ghost.</i>

01:49.248 --> 01:50.884
<i>I was in diapers.</i>

01:52.787 --> 01:54.822
<i>When I met Micky Adams,
he tried to teach me</i>

01:54.954 --> 01:58.225
<i>what music is, that the wind
is the world breathing</i>

01:58.358 --> 02:02.061
<i>and sometimes you can
even hear it sing.</i>

02:02.194 --> 02:04.997
<i>What the fuck did I need
to know any of that for?</i>

02:06.132 --> 02:09.669
<i>It was 1996, and I was
in the music business.</i>

02:27.621 --> 02:29.522
<i>Johnny Depp owns
this place.</i>

02:29.657 --> 02:31.124
<i>I had a drink
with him once.</i>

02:31.258 --> 02:33.661
<i>He quietly made me
feel like an idiot.</i>

02:37.131 --> 02:39.566
Space Hog,
big fuckin' jam, man.

02:39.699 --> 02:41.000
Yeah, fuckin'-A right?

02:41.133 --> 02:44.671
<i>Right over there?
River Phoenix flamed out</i>

02:44.805 --> 02:46.640
<i>never to rise
from the ashes.</i>

02:46.772 --> 02:49.008
<i>They say he died
for our sins.</i>

02:49.143 --> 02:50.311
Thanks, Bud.

02:50.443 --> 02:52.546
<i>I don't think
that's gonna cover it.</i>

03:05.324 --> 03:09.729
<i>To me, guys like Micky Adams
were ancient history,</i>

03:09.864 --> 03:12.099
<i>and I was focused
on the future:</i>

03:12.231 --> 03:16.704
<i>the next Nirvana,
Weezer, No Doubt.</i>

03:16.836 --> 03:18.838
<i>That's what I was looking for.</i>

03:25.913 --> 03:27.281
Can I get
a vodka rocks?

03:36.289 --> 03:38.691
Vodka Rocks,
a great name for a band.

03:38.825 --> 03:42.963
Pectorals meets The Clash,
tip of the hat to ZZ Top.

03:47.501 --> 03:48.769
Thank you.

04:37.716 --> 04:39.919
<i>Rock 'n' roll is here to stay.</i>

04:41.620 --> 04:47.293
<i>Life is a disease and the
only cure is rock 'n' roll.</i>

04:47.427 --> 04:50.263
I have seen the future
of rock 'n' roll.

04:50.396 --> 04:52.399
Landau!

04:52.533 --> 04:54.268
- About Springsteen?
- Uh-huh.

04:54.401 --> 04:55.502
Fuck off.

04:55.636 --> 04:58.406
Charlie Porter.
Indigo Records.

05:07.646 --> 05:10.050
Hi. Charlie Porter.
I'm Cory.

05:10.182 --> 05:13.519
Think it was Dylan that said,
"When opportunity knocks,

05:13.653 --> 05:14.987
don't be too stoned
to answer."

05:15.122 --> 05:18.391
Dylan never said that,
but if he was here right now,

05:18.524 --> 05:20.527
I bet he'd say, "Fuck off!"

05:20.661 --> 05:22.329
<i>One day,
and I hope it's soon,</i>

05:22.461 --> 05:24.798
<i>I'm going to smash
a pie in this kid's face.</i>

05:24.930 --> 05:27.367
Three of you
are really good.

05:31.771 --> 05:34.408
Hey! Um, sorry
about that.

05:34.540 --> 05:37.911
Rocket is a horrible drunk
and a worse boyfriend.

05:38.045 --> 05:39.980
And an even worse
guitar player.

05:40.112 --> 05:41.714
He's clunky,
and he's derivative,

05:41.848 --> 05:44.185
and you blow him
off the stage.

05:46.353 --> 05:51.290
I actually don't blow him
anywhere anymore.

05:51.425 --> 05:52.860
We broke up.

05:54.728 --> 05:56.295
Can I get you a drink?

05:56.430 --> 05:57.364
Beer.

05:57.497 --> 05:58.632
Beer?

05:58.766 --> 06:00.667
Can I have
a beer please?

06:00.800 --> 06:02.134
Thank you.

06:02.269 --> 06:04.905
You know I don't think
he knows it yet, though.

06:05.038 --> 06:06.906
That we broke up.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.975
We just kind of entered
the sexual-tension-in-the-band

06:10.110 --> 06:12.846
part of the
rock 'n' roll cliché.

06:12.978 --> 06:15.581
I could help with the lead-
singer-becomes-a-star

06:15.714 --> 06:17.983
while-her-boyfriend-spends-his
time-in-rehab-teaching-fellow

06:18.117 --> 06:20.887
juicers-Voodoo-Child-on-a
second-hand-Strat...

06:21.721 --> 06:23.089
part of the cliché.

06:24.458 --> 06:26.393
Well, do you think
we're any good?

06:26.526 --> 06:31.197
I think your band can't decide
if it's Guns N' Roses or Hole.

06:31.331 --> 06:33.834
Whatever it is you're all
trying to be, but never will be.

06:33.966 --> 06:35.467
You aren't very nice.

06:36.136 --> 06:38.271
I'm not paid to be nice.

06:38.404 --> 06:41.941
Well, I'm not very nice either,
but I don't get paid for it.

06:42.074 --> 06:46.712
Part of the
not-getting-paid-at-all cliché.

06:46.846 --> 06:48.581
I can help you with that too.

06:48.716 --> 06:50.850
Hey...

06:51.851 --> 06:53.553
Call me.

07:04.497 --> 07:05.932
There you go.

07:07.535 --> 07:08.802
Josh.

07:22.516 --> 07:23.818
Steph!

07:25.386 --> 07:27.822
Oh, you look
really good today.

07:39.132 --> 07:41.701
You think I like doing this?

07:41.834 --> 07:45.238
Don't you think I'd rather be on
the floor watching the Lakers?

07:45.372 --> 07:47.407
What's happening
with, uh, Micky Adams?

07:47.540 --> 07:48.575
I-In terms of...

07:48.709 --> 07:51.744
I-In terms of dropping him,
you fucking moron.

07:51.877 --> 07:54.213
Cobain may be gone,
but somebody's got to keep Courtney

07:54.348 --> 07:55.848
in smack
and ripped stockings.

07:55.983 --> 07:57.350
Well...

07:57.483 --> 07:59.719
And yet again, I'm forced
to deal with the specter

07:59.853 --> 08:01.187
of Micky Adams.

08:01.321 --> 08:03.190
Has Micky
Adams crossed him?

08:03.322 --> 08:06.392
Micky Adams was my friend.
I managed Micky Adams.

08:06.526 --> 08:08.294
I got him high,
and I got him laid,

08:08.427 --> 08:10.430
and I watched him get a quarter
million a year in perpetuity.

08:10.564 --> 08:15.435
And now Micky Adams haunts me
because no one seems to know

08:15.567 --> 08:17.204
how to get rid of him.

08:17.336 --> 08:20.339
Well, we've tried.
He has no agent.

08:20.473 --> 08:21.408
He has no lawyer.

08:21.541 --> 08:24.343
Does he have an address?

08:24.476 --> 08:25.945
Yes.

08:26.980 --> 08:30.918
Then why don't you go there
and drop him?

08:31.050 --> 08:33.019
We've tried.
We've sent people.

08:33.153 --> 08:34.486
- And?
- Well, no one...

08:36.956 --> 08:38.625
No one comes back.

08:41.594 --> 08:43.030
I'll do it.

08:43.163 --> 08:45.599
- Who are you?
- I'm Charlie.

08:45.731 --> 08:47.933
- He works in the mail room.
- Yeah, he's nobody.

08:48.067 --> 08:50.235
Is that what you are,
Charlie?

08:50.370 --> 08:51.404
Nobody?

08:52.739 --> 08:54.408
Nobody's fool.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.117
Why don't you two go?

09:07.553 --> 09:09.288
How long have you been
in the mail room?

09:09.422 --> 09:10.957
Long enough
to know better.

09:11.091 --> 09:12.125
Want my job?
You can have it.

09:12.258 --> 09:14.694
Get your shit
outta here by lunch.

09:14.827 --> 09:16.496
This fucking business,

09:16.629 --> 09:18.097
I feel like
I'm riding a dinosaur

09:18.230 --> 09:20.000
into the jaws
of the apocalypse.

09:20.134 --> 09:22.335
Come here. I want you
to hear something.

09:22.469 --> 09:24.270
This is Micky Adam's
latest offering.

09:24.403 --> 09:26.773
It's a CD he calls, "Doors."

09:26.907 --> 09:29.242
Some kind of homage
to Jim Morrison.

09:30.374 --> 09:31.944
No, it's a very real
homage to masturbation.

09:32.077 --> 09:35.581
- Listen. First track.
- Homage.

09:38.150 --> 09:39.519
Second track.

09:43.023 --> 09:44.091
Third track.

09:44.224 --> 09:45.892
This is my personal
favorite here.

09:48.595 --> 09:50.096
What is that?

09:50.230 --> 09:52.699
It's a coffin.
Unfortunately, it's not his.

09:52.832 --> 09:55.334
If it were, he'd sell more
than two CD's in a decade.

09:55.467 --> 10:00.640
And finally, ten minutes of a
refrigerator opening and closing.

10:02.642 --> 10:03.677
Boy, is he nuts.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.378
Yeah, he's a big crazy baby.

10:05.511 --> 10:08.581
Uploaded leftover from
a drug-addled, pampered,

10:08.716 --> 10:10.650
completely out of control
time in music.

10:10.783 --> 10:12.052
Stephanie!

10:12.184 --> 10:15.521
The bill for which
has somehow landed on my desk.

10:15.654 --> 10:18.692
Go out to Montecito.
Get that big baby to countersign

10:18.825 --> 10:22.495
that buyout agreement that releases
us from blah blah blah blah...

10:22.629 --> 10:23.964
and then maybe...

10:24.096 --> 10:26.399
maybe your mail room days
are over, Charlie.

10:26.933 --> 10:28.168
You got it.

10:29.635 --> 10:31.404
That's the last
great thing he did.

10:31.538 --> 10:33.307
Give it a listen
on the way up to Montecito.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.975
Maybe there's a clue in there on
how to dump his oatmeal-y ass.

10:36.109 --> 10:37.344
How soon do you want this done?

10:37.476 --> 10:39.645
- Yesterday.
- I'm already there.

Hey!

14:39.219 --> 14:40.721
Fuck!

14:44.155 --> 14:45.658
Who the hell are you?

14:46.525 --> 14:48.227
I'm Charlie.

14:48.361 --> 14:51.329
- Are you one of them?
- What are you doing?

14:51.464 --> 14:53.767
You could have
electrocuted yourself.

14:53.899 --> 14:56.502
You A&R piece of shit.

14:56.635 --> 14:58.437
Do you have any idea how
hard it is to stay under?

14:58.572 --> 15:00.273
How much willpower it takes?

15:00.405 --> 15:04.109
I was recording,
you dipshit!

15:04.243 --> 15:05.979
What the hell do you want?

15:06.113 --> 15:08.248
I'm from Indigo Records.

15:08.381 --> 15:10.983
You actually sound proud
of that, Sparky.

15:11.116 --> 15:13.552
Okay, Mr. Adams, we have
some business to discuss.

15:13.686 --> 15:16.589
I'm an artist.
I don't discuss business.

15:16.722 --> 15:18.524
With all due respect,
I don't think I would call

15:18.658 --> 15:21.327
the sound of doors
opening and closing art.

15:32.839 --> 15:34.641
I'll tell you something, Sparky.

15:35.542 --> 15:37.777
There's nothing more evocative

15:37.909 --> 15:41.581
than the sound of doors
opening and closing.

15:41.714 --> 15:44.217
Nothing more hopeful
and nothing more final.

15:44.350 --> 15:49.254
When you reach my age, if your callowness
and stupidity hasn't already done you in,

15:49.389 --> 15:51.625
which is something
devoutly to be wished...

15:52.725 --> 15:54.528
maybe you'll understand that.

15:56.562 --> 15:57.798
I doubt it.

15:59.164 --> 16:00.433
Hungry?

16:04.537 --> 16:06.739
What is this?

16:06.871 --> 16:10.209
It's a spaghetti and
mayonnaise sandwich. My fave.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.646
Lowell George
turned me on to 'em.

16:12.778 --> 16:14.147
Eat.

16:24.923 --> 16:25.958
Hmm.

16:29.995 --> 16:33.699
Mmm. Is this Sprite?

16:33.833 --> 16:35.434
I haven't had Sprite
in a long time.

16:35.567 --> 16:38.004
Sure, it could be.
Sprite, yeah.

16:38.136 --> 16:41.039
The new Spritelier Sprite.

16:41.173 --> 16:42.408
Ha ha.

16:43.909 --> 16:46.480
You want to know why you don't
have any hair on your ankles?

16:46.613 --> 16:48.648
I didn't know
I don't have hair on my ankles.

16:48.780 --> 16:50.248
How did you know that?

16:51.049 --> 16:55.322
I'm an artist.
I notice everything.

16:55.455 --> 16:56.756
'Cause you're getting old.

16:56.889 --> 16:58.625
I'm 23.

16:58.758 --> 17:01.427
Well, just 'cause you're young,
doesn't mean you're not getting old.

17:01.561 --> 17:03.797
You think you're free
from the vagaries, man?

17:03.929 --> 17:05.097
Blow yourself.

17:05.231 --> 17:07.599
Have...
Have some more Sprite.

17:09.335 --> 17:15.441
You know, the last guy that
came up here, Stanley something.

17:15.575 --> 17:16.741
We had a helluva good time,

17:16.875 --> 17:19.546
but he left here thinking
I was the Devil.

17:21.579 --> 17:23.615
Um, Mr. Adams...

17:23.749 --> 17:26.051
Nah.
Don't call me that.

17:27.386 --> 17:29.588
- Okay, may I call you Micky?
- No.

17:29.721 --> 17:32.526
Anyway.
Back to the business at hand.

17:32.659 --> 17:34.894
- So there are two ways we can play this.
- Play this!

17:35.027 --> 17:37.631
- I have in my possession...
- Talk like a human.

17:37.763 --> 17:40.199
...a signed contract,
which terminates your contract,

17:40.333 --> 17:43.769
the financial terms of which I'm sure
you'll find much to your satisfaction.

17:43.903 --> 17:45.971
You're a cocky little
fucker, aren't you?

17:46.105 --> 17:48.474
Would you have some more
Spritelier Sprite?

17:49.642 --> 17:50.911
It's good.

17:53.479 --> 17:56.048
There are two ways
we could play this, Mr. Adams.

17:56.182 --> 17:57.918
You're clinging to that
phrase like a lifeboat.

17:58.050 --> 18:00.386
Now you can sign
this now, okay?

18:00.519 --> 18:02.721
Or you can sign it later,

18:02.855 --> 18:06.293
but I'm not going anywhere
till you do, okay?

18:06.425 --> 18:08.060
Follow-through, man.

18:08.193 --> 18:10.061
It's what I'm all about,
man, follow-through.

18:10.195 --> 18:13.866
Follow-through is
the street where I live.

18:15.234 --> 18:17.402
What was I saying?

18:17.537 --> 18:22.542
The contract... Sorry.
I'm a bit ADD.

18:22.674 --> 18:24.610
Fascinating. Cheers.

18:24.743 --> 18:26.245
You know what?

18:26.378 --> 18:27.913
It's Miss Nicholson's fault.

18:28.047 --> 18:29.515
Who the fuck is
Miss Nicholson?

18:29.648 --> 18:31.584
Miss Nicholson was
my fifth grade teacher.

18:31.718 --> 18:33.687
She used to peer over
my shoulder and just stare at me

18:33.819 --> 18:35.754
with these beady
little rat eyes.

18:35.888 --> 18:38.557
She'd stare at me while I was
trying to do word problems.

18:38.691 --> 18:40.526
Why the fuck am I talking
about this?

18:40.660 --> 18:43.429
I engender revelation,
Sparky.

18:43.563 --> 18:45.932
That's the street
where I live.

18:46.066 --> 18:47.365
- Mr. Adams.
- Ah!

18:47.500 --> 18:50.103
- Sorry, right. Micky!
- Ah!

18:50.236 --> 18:52.439
What do you want me
to call you then?

18:52.571 --> 18:53.772
I always liked Biff.

18:53.905 --> 18:55.907
Attention must be paid!

18:56.041 --> 18:56.775
What?

18:56.910 --> 18:58.011
"Death of a Salesman," man.

18:58.144 --> 19:00.412
Biff. Come on, Sparky.
Try to keep up.

19:00.546 --> 19:01.748
Totally.

19:01.881 --> 19:03.883
Okay, so, Biff,
I'm from Indigo Records.

19:04.017 --> 19:07.620
Yeah. As my daughter
used to say, "Duh."

19:07.752 --> 19:09.154
You have a daughter?

19:09.288 --> 19:10.856
Not according to her.

19:14.693 --> 19:17.262
Did I mention
that I'm from Indigo Records?

19:17.396 --> 19:19.064
Yeah, a lot.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.767
Cool.

19:37.784 --> 19:40.921
I take it you're aware
that your table is melting.

19:41.654 --> 19:43.655
Sure.

19:43.788 --> 19:47.093
And that the walls are...
on fire.

19:48.528 --> 19:50.029
You bet.

19:53.932 --> 19:56.568
I'm a Zamboni.
That's not what I said though.

19:56.702 --> 19:58.238
Hear voices.
You have to pay me for that.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.273
I'm seeing things.
I'm fucking hearing things!

20:00.405 --> 20:01.807
What is happening, Micky?

20:01.941 --> 20:05.144
You're kind of vague.
What's happening where?

20:06.179 --> 20:08.147
In spite of what you're
feeling at this juncture,

20:08.280 --> 20:10.750
you're handling this a lot
better than Stanley Wilson did.

20:10.883 --> 20:13.086
Wait! Stanley Wilson,
that was it!

20:13.219 --> 20:14.988
You drugged me!
You gave me something!

20:15.121 --> 20:16.822
You did, huh?
You drugged me? You dosed me?

20:16.955 --> 20:18.857
- Aren't you feeling Spritelier?
- Fuck you!

20:18.990 --> 20:21.426
- What did you give me, huh?
- Don't have a name for it yet.

20:23.828 --> 20:25.999
I know what it's like
to be born.

20:27.967 --> 20:33.940
Hey, Micky, you know...
everyone thinks you are nuts.

20:34.073 --> 20:35.542
I am nuts.

20:35.674 --> 20:38.009
And my boss said that
you're a big baby.

20:38.144 --> 20:39.311
Yeah, well.

20:39.444 --> 20:42.648
Donny Rumson is an anorexic
fascist who is emblematic

20:42.781 --> 20:44.951
of the decline of all
that is good and holy.

20:45.084 --> 20:48.654
The only thing Donny Rumson has
going for him is his hair...

20:49.721 --> 20:51.891
and that bogus whisper thing.

20:52.023 --> 20:55.894
I am not afraid
to stand naked! Okay?

20:56.028 --> 20:56.796
Dig it!

20:56.930 --> 20:58.565
Clothes are
for cowards, man!

20:58.698 --> 20:59.965
Fuck it. I don't need 'em!

21:00.098 --> 21:02.167
Once you go buck,
you never go back.

21:02.301 --> 21:03.469
That's right, man!

21:03.603 --> 21:06.172
I hunger for the wind on my skin
and the rivers rushing

21:06.305 --> 21:09.576
through my veins and the night
dancing with my heart beating.

21:09.709 --> 21:10.776
Can you do
that again?

21:10.910 --> 21:12.979
What is in me is without me.

21:13.112 --> 21:16.649
I have thoughts
in a green shade.

21:16.782 --> 21:18.550
- Man, that was fucking epic!
- All right?

21:18.684 --> 21:22.288
I just thought of that.
I just thought of that! Thank you!

21:22.421 --> 21:23.588
That's the gift.

21:23.721 --> 21:25.424
What is in me is
without me!

21:25.557 --> 21:27.394
This particular drug.
Come on. Let's go, man.

21:27.527 --> 21:29.362
- Okay, where are we going?
- Let's put some shit up on the hill.

21:29.494 --> 21:30.428
Up! Let's go up!

21:30.563 --> 21:31.765
Are you bringing
the thing?

21:31.897 --> 21:32.831
Yeah, I'm bringing
the thing.

21:32.965 --> 21:34.000
Okay, let me
get my bag.

21:34.133 --> 21:36.001
Man, that was gold!

21:37.036 --> 21:40.774
<i>♪ I'm seein' endless

21:40.906 --> 21:44.376

22:08.300 --> 22:12.270
- Wild!
- Come on now.

22:12.403 --> 22:14.073
It's incredibly wild
and you know what, man?

22:14.205 --> 22:15.908
It's incredibly holy, man.

22:16.041 --> 22:19.345
And spirit, everything is spirit.
It's all spirit!

22:19.478 --> 22:21.814
Man, there is shit going on
underneath the surface

22:21.948 --> 22:23.449
that is too deep
for tears.

22:23.583 --> 22:25.551
Yeah, man,
and the waves, man!

22:25.683 --> 22:27.721
Look at the waves.
Listen to them!

22:28.820 --> 22:30.521
It's like an
never-ending roar, man!

22:30.655 --> 22:32.959
It's fucking scary, huh?

22:34.259 --> 22:35.929
You want to know
what's scary?

22:36.828 --> 22:38.830
Not really. Ha!

22:38.964 --> 22:41.166
You know what a rogue wave
is, Sparky?

22:42.401 --> 22:44.504
I have no idea, Biff.

22:44.636 --> 22:48.374
It's this huge wave,
sometimes 20, 30 feet.

22:48.508 --> 22:51.211
It comes out of nothing,
from nowhere...

22:53.011 --> 22:55.248
just washes everything away.

22:56.949 --> 22:58.451
It's cool!

22:58.585 --> 23:02.555
Yeah, it is cool 'cause
a human can't stay underwater

23:02.688 --> 23:04.090
by sheer will.

23:04.222 --> 23:10.629
Fat, instinct, whatever.
It almost always rises up.

23:10.762 --> 23:12.530
A rogue wave can
take care of that.

23:12.664 --> 23:16.903
It's super cool.
It's really, really cool.

23:17.036 --> 23:20.907
That's what I am,
you little fuck.

23:21.740 --> 23:23.276
A rogue wave.

23:23.409 --> 23:25.177
I came from nothing,
from nowhere.

23:25.309 --> 23:26.745
My father sold shoes
for a living,

23:26.878 --> 23:27.980
and my mother
licked them clean.

23:28.114 --> 23:30.048
And from them came me,
a rogue wave,

23:30.182 --> 23:31.985
and I washed
the world clean.

23:32.117 --> 23:33.653
Me!

23:33.786 --> 23:34.787
You want to dump me?

23:34.920 --> 23:36.255
You and that piece
of shit label!

23:36.388 --> 23:38.290
Is that what
you fucking think?

23:38.423 --> 23:41.126
I will drown
your fuckin' ass!

23:51.503 --> 23:52.571
Listen.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.174
What?

23:56.308 --> 23:59.846
The world, it's singing.

24:03.449 --> 24:05.585
Come on! It's fuckin' amazing!

24:07.252 --> 24:08.855
I don't hear anything.

24:11.223 --> 24:14.693
It's fucking pretty though.
I like the silence.

24:14.826 --> 24:16.662
I don't hear anything.

24:16.796 --> 24:18.131
Micky.

24:35.815 --> 24:37.150
Oh, my God!

24:38.083 --> 24:39.185
That's unbelievable!

24:39.317 --> 24:40.519
Micky, that's you!
That's you!

24:40.653 --> 24:42.922
How are you there and here
at the same time?

24:44.423 --> 24:46.259
Fuck me!

24:48.059 --> 24:49.561
Cameroon!

24:50.729 --> 24:52.364
Cameroon!

24:55.468 --> 24:56.569
Who is that?

24:57.836 --> 24:59.904
Cameroon,
you fucking maniac!

25:00.038 --> 25:01.640
Micky? Hey, Micky!

25:01.773 --> 25:02.841
Gotcha!

25:06.578 --> 25:07.846
Oh, oh, yeah.

25:07.980 --> 25:08.980
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

25:09.114 --> 25:10.649
Hey, come on, come on!

25:10.781 --> 25:12.518
Let's go, let's go,
let's go! Come with me.

25:12.651 --> 25:16.654
Fuck! Cameroon, man!
Fucking jacked my llama!

25:16.788 --> 25:18.023
Sparky?

25:19.057 --> 25:20.559
Sparky!

25:24.930 --> 25:26.532
Oh!

25:26.664 --> 25:27.966
Ah!

25:28.101 --> 25:29.702
Dude.

25:29.835 --> 25:30.769
Oh, dude.

25:30.903 --> 25:31.971
Jesus!

25:32.104 --> 25:34.440
No, it's Brandon.

25:34.573 --> 25:36.976
Come on, dude.
We'll hook you up.

25:46.551 --> 25:47.852
The contract.

25:47.987 --> 25:49.389
Fuck!

26:15.515 --> 26:16.983
Still here!

26:18.084 --> 26:19.551
You're the first one
to ever come back.

26:19.684 --> 26:22.120
Follow-through is
the street where I live.

26:22.253 --> 26:23.288
That's a pretty
boring street.

26:23.422 --> 26:25.257
You must be
the daughter.

26:25.391 --> 26:27.793
According to
the father.

26:27.925 --> 26:28.894
I'm Charlie.

26:29.027 --> 26:31.063
I know. I'm Julia.

26:31.195 --> 26:32.631
Huh, like the song.

26:32.765 --> 26:34.932
Nope, not about me.

26:35.067 --> 26:36.634
Is your dad home?

26:36.769 --> 26:37.970
He's asleep.

26:38.103 --> 26:40.707
- Can you wake him up?
- I can, but I won't.

26:40.839 --> 26:45.544
Your old man laced my drink
with God-knows-what,

26:45.678 --> 26:46.979
and I woke up naked.

26:47.113 --> 26:50.283
My head is on fire, and I think
I might spontaneously combust.

26:50.415 --> 26:51.716
You're gonna need
to relax.

26:51.849 --> 26:54.653
I'm in no mood for
this early morning badinage.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.087
Ooh, badinage,
good word.

26:56.221 --> 26:58.391
I bet you might
even know what it means.

26:59.625 --> 27:01.059
I'll be back.

27:02.127 --> 27:04.163
You think he's crazy,
don't you?

27:04.296 --> 27:07.599
Yeah. Don't you?

27:07.732 --> 27:10.101
You left here yesterday
saying you were out of here

27:10.236 --> 27:11.436
'cause he's out of his skull.

27:11.569 --> 27:13.771
He's not crazy.
He's just hiding.

27:13.905 --> 27:15.140
From?

27:16.275 --> 27:18.344
All those
other people.

27:22.382 --> 27:23.416
Fuck!

27:37.863 --> 27:40.866
So, he signed it?

27:41.000 --> 27:43.669
Yeah,
I dropped it off at legal.

27:43.801 --> 27:46.238
<i>I figure this
buys me about a week.</i>

27:46.372 --> 27:48.274
My bible is short
and fat-free.

27:48.406 --> 27:51.042
When I say I'm gonna
do something, I do it.

27:51.176 --> 27:52.176
Old school, baby.

27:52.310 --> 27:54.712
Yeah, that's right.

27:57.048 --> 28:00.786
I used to think maybe
I didn't deserve all this,

28:00.920 --> 28:02.321
but I snapped
out of it.

28:02.454 --> 28:07.025
This is America, Pilgrim.
You get what you deserve.

28:07.159 --> 28:08.394
He signed it.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.130
Follow me.

28:13.199 --> 28:14.734
<i>I will follow him.</i>

28:16.601 --> 28:19.238

Mmm. I read the Kushner article
on you in <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

28:47.333 --> 28:49.735
It sounds like you fought
like hell to get here.

28:49.867 --> 28:53.905
Yeah, it's a real New York
bootstraps story, sure.

28:54.039 --> 28:57.343
Iovine isn't the only scrapper
out of Brooklyn, you know.

28:57.476 --> 29:00.612
My dad died when I was seven.
My mom had to go back to work.

29:00.746 --> 29:02.782
I was pretty much
on my own since then.

29:02.914 --> 29:07.451
Fuck if I wasn't getting out of that
hell hole first chance that I could.

29:12.692 --> 29:16.060
Yeah, I dug my way out, and
I won't let anything stop me.

29:16.194 --> 29:18.763
And that's what
kills me about them.

29:20.097 --> 29:21.166
Who?

29:21.299 --> 29:25.903
The... artists.

29:26.038 --> 29:28.574
Yeah,
they know pain and shit,

29:28.707 --> 29:30.876
and some of them have real
fucking talent to back it up.

29:31.009 --> 29:35.480
But what fucking kills me is
they will throw it all away

29:35.614 --> 29:40.685
over hurt feelings
and ego and shit.

29:40.819 --> 29:43.654
Axl and Slash,
Eddie V and David Lee!

29:43.788 --> 29:46.525
Yes. And who knows what
Art Garfunkel was thinking?

29:46.659 --> 29:49.094
Exactly!

29:49.228 --> 29:51.330
All right, lesson number one.

29:51.463 --> 29:53.398
Do not fall in love
with the artist.

29:53.531 --> 29:56.100
Never confuse the artist
with his art.

29:56.233 --> 29:57.435
Bob Dylan.

29:57.568 --> 30:00.638
Bob Dylan is not
"Mr. Tambourine Man."

30:00.772 --> 30:03.541
Nobody is who you think
they are, except for Vedder.

30:03.674 --> 30:05.877
Tomorrow he'll help build
another Planned Parenthood

30:06.010 --> 30:09.347
and be out there on his
longboard by three.

30:09.480 --> 30:12.084
Other than that, it's a
fucking wasteland out there.

30:12.218 --> 30:15.987
There is a hole in the
soul of rock 'n' roll.

30:16.121 --> 30:19.658
And you know what?
I think Charlie Porter could fill it, huh?

30:19.790 --> 30:22.360
That's a really big
statement, Charlie.

30:23.162 --> 30:24.096
I found this girl.

30:24.229 --> 30:25.297
Girl. What girl?

30:25.431 --> 30:27.732
Well? Look.

30:30.669 --> 30:32.972
Great eyes. Can she sing?

30:33.105 --> 30:37.309
Jesus,
look at those... eyes!

31:25.557 --> 31:27.058
You're stupid.

31:33.798 --> 31:34.532
Hey!

31:34.665 --> 31:36.134
- Hey, Big Man.
- Hi.

31:36.268 --> 31:37.736
I got your message.

31:37.868 --> 31:40.304
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you, thanks.

31:40.439 --> 31:42.508
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, yeah, please, come in.

31:45.644 --> 31:47.479
You must be
really excited.

31:47.612 --> 31:51.216
Oh, yeah, you kidding me?
It's unreal.

31:51.348 --> 31:53.250
Nice digs.

31:53.384 --> 31:55.086
It's so messy. I'm sorry.

31:55.220 --> 31:58.356
- Do you want a beer?
- Yeah.

32:04.128 --> 32:06.598
What's, uh,
Mr. Brand-new A&R man doing

32:06.731 --> 32:08.667
all by himself
on a Friday night?

32:10.669 --> 32:17.075
Well, he's not all by himself
now, is he? Right?

32:17.209 --> 32:19.745
No, he's not.

32:20.945 --> 32:23.048
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

32:25.750 --> 32:29.754
What did your boss say
when you mentioned me?

32:31.289 --> 32:33.759
That you have
great eyes.

32:33.893 --> 32:34.994
Yeah.

32:36.295 --> 32:38.997
And do you agree?

32:39.131 --> 32:41.033
Yeah, I do.

32:43.301 --> 32:45.103
You have an eyelash.

33:09.228 --> 33:11.663
Don't be afraid
to tell me what you want.

33:16.868 --> 33:17.903
Okay.

33:21.839 --> 33:24.676
I want a house
on Point Dume by 24...

33:26.144 --> 33:28.980
Ferrari by 25.

33:30.048 --> 33:34.886
I want Donny Rumson's job
by, like, 30.

33:36.888 --> 33:42.427
I want to master
that whisper thing he does

33:43.127 --> 33:44.596
- probably by 40.
- Yeah.

33:49.367 --> 33:52.636
I want his hair at 50.

33:52.770 --> 33:55.106
I want you to never stop
doing that.

34:02.681 --> 34:05.750
All of you is perfect,
like, this body is the one

34:05.884 --> 34:07.519
that I've been waiting for.

34:07.653 --> 34:09.286
Do you think
this body can sing?

34:09.420 --> 34:11.922
I think
this body's a symphony.

34:12.056 --> 34:14.559
Do you think
this body's a star?

34:14.693 --> 34:17.027
I think this body's
the Milky Way.

34:18.896 --> 34:20.898
Mmm.

34:21.032 --> 34:22.067
Finally.

34:52.297 --> 34:55.099
Daddy! Daddy!

34:56.268 --> 34:57.903
Daddy.

34:58.036 --> 35:00.239
Dad, come on!

35:00.371 --> 35:01.438
Are you serious?

35:01.572 --> 35:02.807
Look at me!

35:05.242 --> 35:07.578
- I thought you said he wasn't crazy.
- He's not.

35:07.713 --> 35:09.481
Dad? Get down
from there.

35:09.614 --> 35:11.115
He's just
a little bipolar.

35:11.248 --> 35:13.317
This is not amusing!

35:13.451 --> 35:14.818
With manic depressive
tendencies.

35:14.952 --> 35:16.320
- But not crazy?
- Oh, God, no!

35:16.454 --> 35:17.855
Goddamn it!
Please!

35:17.989 --> 35:19.691
Is there a specific
reason he's up there

35:19.824 --> 35:21.259
or just general non-madness?

35:21.393 --> 35:22.795
This.

35:27.199 --> 35:28.000
What the hell?

35:28.132 --> 35:29.801
It was in the Enquirer.

35:29.934 --> 35:32.436
I am but
a tarnished angel.

35:32.570 --> 35:33.706
Hey, Charlie.

35:33.838 --> 35:34.639
Hi.

35:34.773 --> 35:36.541
Um, who took this picture?

35:36.675 --> 35:40.345
Cameroon Robbins. The prick.
Charlie, why don't you come on up here?

35:40.478 --> 35:41.945
Who the fuck is
Cameroon Robbins?

35:42.079 --> 35:44.516
And why is he taking pictures
of us naked?

35:44.650 --> 35:46.017
Charlie.

35:46.150 --> 35:49.521
And uh, why don't you come
down here, Micky, huh?

35:50.422 --> 35:51.889
Okay.

35:52.023 --> 35:53.224
Okay.

35:58.028 --> 36:00.733
- Oh, shit!
- No-no-no-no!

36:02.666 --> 36:04.268
Daddy? Daddy! Well?

36:04.402 --> 36:05.536
Well, what?

36:05.670 --> 36:07.405
Well, do something!
You're the guy!

36:07.539 --> 36:08.774
Yup-yup.
Fuckin' whale.

36:08.907 --> 36:10.843
- Hurry up. Come on!
- All right.

36:20.184 --> 36:21.186
Come on, Micky.

36:21.318 --> 36:22.887
What the fuck, man?

36:24.255 --> 36:26.156
I'm tired, Charlie.

36:27.525 --> 36:29.327
Too tired today to try.

36:38.802 --> 36:41.572
He's asleep.

36:41.706 --> 36:43.541
Your clothes
are almost dry.

36:43.675 --> 36:45.410
Thanks.

36:45.543 --> 36:47.045
Who's Cameroon Robbins?

36:47.179 --> 36:49.180
He used to write for <i>Rolling
Stone</i> a million years ago

36:49.313 --> 36:52.082
before they started
putting tits on the cover.

36:52.217 --> 36:54.786
Now all he does is kind of sneak
around and stalk my father.

36:54.918 --> 36:57.355
He peeks through our windows.
He goes through our trash.

36:57.489 --> 36:59.157
He calls himself
an Adamsologist,

36:59.291 --> 37:01.927
but he's really just a
lonely old pain in the ass.

37:02.059 --> 37:04.061
Can we just get back
to the business at hand?

37:04.195 --> 37:07.399
He really needs to sign
the contract, Julia.

37:07.532 --> 37:08.834
Your father needs
to be realistic.

37:08.967 --> 37:10.401
This is
an inevitable formality.

37:10.534 --> 37:11.737
Aren't you a little young

37:11.869 --> 37:13.771
to be concerned with
inevitable formalities?

37:17.009 --> 37:19.177
The contract is not currently
in my possession, I forgot.

37:19.311 --> 37:21.746
Perhaps your dog ate it.

37:21.880 --> 37:23.882
Or perhaps
in a drug-induced stupor,

37:24.014 --> 37:25.650
I unwittingly threw it
into the ocean.

37:25.782 --> 37:27.217
Not that I have
any memory of it.

37:27.351 --> 37:29.355
Maybe you were soaring on
the wings of your better angels.

37:29.487 --> 37:32.089
I don't know what that means,
and I don't really fucking care!

37:32.224 --> 37:34.059
I got a job to do, and goddamn
it, I'm gonna do it!

37:34.193 --> 37:36.395
- Shush! You're gonna wake him up!
- Good! Somebody has to!

37:36.527 --> 37:38.262
Let me ask you something,
Mr. Charlie Porter.

37:38.396 --> 37:40.164
How would you feel if everybody
thinks you're a genius

37:40.297 --> 37:42.400
and then, whimsically, one day,
they decide that you're not.

37:42.534 --> 37:44.802
That you're uncool, over,
that you're embarrassing

37:44.936 --> 37:47.172
and that you should
maybe just go away?

37:47.304 --> 37:48.339
Or even better, die.

37:48.472 --> 37:50.041
You know what I would do?

37:51.275 --> 37:53.377
I would just sign
on the dotted line,

37:53.512 --> 37:56.181
take the money and fade
gracefully into the sunset.

37:56.313 --> 37:57.482
Fuck you.

37:57.615 --> 38:00.184
You have no idea the people
who used to hang out here.

38:00.318 --> 38:02.586
Legends. I grew up bouncing
on the knees of legends.

38:02.719 --> 38:04.488
They all took
to the hills.

38:04.623 --> 38:06.858
All that's left is me.

38:10.827 --> 38:12.230
Where's your mom?

38:14.798 --> 38:16.034
She died.

38:21.405 --> 38:22.807
My father too.

38:25.010 --> 38:28.347
Just too weird for words
isn't it, when they die?

38:31.516 --> 38:33.284
Everything stops.

38:40.559 --> 38:42.760
Oh, well,
what are you gonna do?

38:42.893 --> 38:45.730
Move out, move on,
focus on your own life.

38:45.864 --> 38:47.833
I'm all he has,
Charlie.

38:47.965 --> 38:50.435
Even a shitty real thing
is better than a memory.

38:52.804 --> 38:54.172
Yeah.

38:55.373 --> 38:56.740
Where are you going?

38:56.875 --> 38:58.309
We're out of
mayonnaise.

39:01.378 --> 39:03.481
Um, what do I do
when he wakes up?

39:05.150 --> 39:08.253
That's your call,
Mr. Follow-Through Boulevard.

39:11.690 --> 39:13.624
Hey, Julia.

39:13.757 --> 39:18.129
Wasn't there something else
you wanted to do with your life?

39:18.262 --> 39:20.164
Yes.

43:38.222 --> 43:39.725
I know the sound
of nothing.

43:41.626 --> 43:44.463
How does this thing
even stay in tune?

43:44.596 --> 43:46.130
Play it again.

43:48.500 --> 43:51.768
Okay. I can't believe
I'm doing this.

43:53.170 --> 43:56.640
Nothing you can imagine is
wilder than what's real, Sparky.

44:34.746 --> 44:36.381
Keep going.

44:53.831 --> 44:55.400
Play!

45:14.418 --> 45:17.489
Play. Just play.

46:45.675 --> 46:48.545

my heart's gonna explode.

46:48.679 --> 46:55.386

46:56.219 --> 46:58.655
- And you!
- Me what?

46:58.789 --> 47:00.858
You are my muse!

47:00.990 --> 47:03.827
No, no, I'm not your muse.
I'm a suit. You said so yourself.

47:03.961 --> 47:05.362
You are my muse
in suit's clothing,

47:05.496 --> 47:06.731
and I'm not letting you
outta my sight!

47:06.864 --> 47:08.967
I have a job, Micky!
The contract.

47:09.099 --> 47:11.435
Fuck the contract, man!
The contract is bullshit.

47:11.568 --> 47:13.404
You just saw what
I can do, man!

47:13.538 --> 47:15.472
Sweet Mother of God!

47:16.541 --> 47:18.309
This happiness is
strong medicine, man!

47:19.909 --> 47:21.278
Wait, wait.
I'm getting ahead of myself.

47:21.411 --> 47:22.947
I've gotta start
writing again.

47:24.014 --> 47:25.550
I got to write a hit.

47:27.485 --> 47:29.053
I'm gonna write a hit.

47:29.186 --> 47:30.555
Do you know why?

47:31.489 --> 47:32.456
Not really, no.

47:32.590 --> 47:35.393

47:35.525 --> 47:37.393

47:37.527 --> 47:39.129
Micky, Micky.
Stop, stop!

47:41.666 --> 47:42.834
Ha!

47:44.168 --> 47:47.005
Ha! Aaah!

47:47.905 --> 47:50.306
I can't believe
we're doing this.

47:50.440 --> 47:52.376
This is so crazy.

47:54.010 --> 47:56.614
Who was it told you
you couldn't play the piano?

47:58.481 --> 48:00.083
That was a
weird segue.

48:00.217 --> 48:01.952
Who?

48:02.085 --> 48:05.155
Why do you think somebody told
me I couldn't play the piano?

48:05.289 --> 48:06.490
If somebody didn't
tell you that,

48:06.623 --> 48:08.726
you wouldn't be
a fucking suit.

48:09.927 --> 48:11.394
Was it Mrs. Nicholson?

48:11.528 --> 48:14.599
No, it wasn't Mrs.
Nicholson. Jesus, Micky.

48:14.731 --> 48:16.199
It's my only frame
of reference.

48:16.333 --> 48:17.268
I give up.

48:17.400 --> 48:19.403
It was
my father.

48:21.338 --> 48:22.806
Happy?

48:22.940 --> 48:26.010
Now maybe we can have a little
less talking about that.

48:26.143 --> 48:27.745
Uh-huh.

48:29.146 --> 48:31.915
My muse has
father issues.

48:32.050 --> 48:35.452
Can we drop that because
everybody has father issues?

48:35.586 --> 48:37.621
Is he still alive?

48:37.755 --> 48:39.022
No.

48:39.155 --> 48:40.891
- Was he famous?
- No.

48:41.025 --> 48:42.026
Bigger than a bread box?

48:42.159 --> 48:43.760
All right,
fuck you, Micky.

48:43.894 --> 48:45.028
Sounds like?

48:45.163 --> 48:48.398
He was the sound of ice
clinking in a bourbon glass.

48:48.532 --> 48:50.900
My father never
loved me.

48:51.034 --> 48:55.405
And as sad as it is to say,
I never loved my father.

48:55.539 --> 48:59.344
I-I meant nothing to him.

49:01.411 --> 49:04.948
My muse is a raven
with a broken wing.

49:05.083 --> 49:07.018
Yeah, he sure is.

49:10.554 --> 49:14.458
I have this fantasy where
I dance on his grave.

49:15.025 --> 49:16.494
I love it!

49:17.961 --> 49:20.431
Yeah.

49:24.335 --> 49:26.503
This is so crazy.

49:26.637 --> 49:28.940
Um, what street?

49:29.072 --> 49:31.442
There's nothing
crazy about this.

49:31.576 --> 49:33.844
- Corvo Way.
- Corvo Way.

49:33.978 --> 49:38.316
Listen, I wrote all
my best stuff in my old room

49:38.449 --> 49:40.050
at my parents' house.

49:40.184 --> 49:44.721
If we go back there,
I'll soak up the vibes and I'm back.

49:44.855 --> 49:47.724
There's nothing
crazy about that.

49:47.858 --> 49:49.960
What's the address again?

49:50.094 --> 49:53.197
- 117.
- There is no 117.

49:54.164 --> 49:56.668
My memory lane's
a dead fuckin' end.

49:59.003 --> 50:00.104
Far out!

50:01.806 --> 50:03.807
What are you
doing, Micky?

50:05.775 --> 50:07.811
Micky?
What are you doing?

50:08.911 --> 50:10.781
Micky, don't
shake the gate.

50:10.914 --> 50:12.750
- Stop.
- This was the living room, right there, man.

50:12.884 --> 50:14.519
My parents' bedroom
was over there.

50:14.652 --> 50:16.552
Muffled yelling,
doors slamming,

50:16.686 --> 50:18.155
cars starting in the middle
of the night.

50:18.289 --> 50:21.325
Fuck, people are waking up.
Micky, stop. Let's just go.

50:21.458 --> 50:22.859
Help me up,
help me up.

50:22.992 --> 50:25.395
- Don't.
- Look, it's my room right there, man!

50:25.528 --> 50:27.364
Don't jump
the fucking fence!

50:27.498 --> 50:29.501
What is this orange shit?

50:30.601 --> 50:31.836
Are you kidding me?

50:33.371 --> 50:35.773
Micky? Micky?

50:38.376 --> 50:39.810
All right man,
all right.

50:39.943 --> 50:41.778
What the fuck are you doing
jumping over a fucking fence?

50:41.911 --> 50:44.214
Sir! I don't know
what the hell is going on here,

50:44.347 --> 50:45.583
but this
is private property.

50:45.715 --> 50:47.451
I-I know, it's...

50:47.585 --> 50:49.320
- Gun!
- What? No.

50:49.452 --> 50:51.789
No, that's whipped cream.
That's whipped cream.

50:51.922 --> 50:52.990
Micky! Micky.

50:54.525 --> 50:55.760
I quit.

50:57.561 --> 50:59.663
I don't want to be your muse.

50:59.797 --> 51:00.798
I think it's lethal.

51:00.931 --> 51:02.766
So, you know what,
I-I quit.

51:02.900 --> 51:05.536
So just sign the contract and
then just-just-just set me free.

51:05.668 --> 51:07.739
Why are you so pissed?

51:09.407 --> 51:11.075
Because I'm in jail.

51:11.208 --> 51:15.112
This isn't jail.
It's a holding cell in Malibu. Calm down.

51:15.246 --> 51:19.115
The big, fat madman is
telling me to calm down.

51:19.250 --> 51:21.686
I must be really out of
my fucking mind, man.

51:21.818 --> 51:23.653
Why do you think
you're out of your mind?

51:23.788 --> 51:27.458
Because you won't sign
the contract.

51:27.590 --> 51:29.226
I think
it's something else.

51:30.728 --> 51:32.028
- Do you?
- But don't worry,

51:32.161 --> 51:34.331
I got half of side one
already written in my head.

51:34.465 --> 51:40.204
They don't fucking make side
ones anymore, you lunatic, okay?

51:40.338 --> 51:42.973
Can you do me a favor, Micky?
Can you stop referring to me

51:43.106 --> 51:45.842
as your muse, okay,
especially to cops,

51:45.976 --> 51:51.615
because it sounds...
it sounds gay, you know?

51:51.748 --> 51:56.119
Oh... so my muse
is homophobic.

51:56.253 --> 51:57.755
No.

51:57.887 --> 52:01.791
You know what?
I think you need me

52:01.925 --> 52:05.429
and that you are very quickly
becoming my best friend.

52:05.563 --> 52:07.898
I-I don't want
to be your best friend.

52:08.030 --> 52:10.268
I don't want
to be your muse...

52:10.400 --> 52:12.135
I just want to go back
to my life.

52:13.302 --> 52:17.240
I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

52:17.375 --> 52:21.210
I'll sign your contract
if you'll be my best friend.

52:21.344 --> 52:23.013
Stop saying best friend!

52:23.146 --> 52:25.148
It makes it sound like
you're five years old, Micky.

52:25.282 --> 52:28.117
Okay, and if I had the contract,
great, but I don't.

52:28.552 --> 52:30.621
What the fuck?

52:30.753 --> 52:33.123
Does the "Horse Whisperer" know?

52:33.257 --> 52:34.925
Who?

52:35.059 --> 52:36.127
Donny.

52:36.260 --> 52:38.395
Yeah, I told Donny
you signed the contract, okay?

52:38.528 --> 52:41.666
Which is a lie, Micky, which has
probably revealed itself to him.

52:41.798 --> 52:43.800
Which means that I'm fucked!
I'm fucked.

52:43.934 --> 52:45.202
Listen, your life's
already over,

52:45.335 --> 52:48.772
so you might as well
just be my best friend.

52:48.905 --> 52:51.942
I'm really, truly
starting to hate you.

52:52.076 --> 52:54.311
Mr. Adams!

52:54.445 --> 52:55.480
A big, big fan.

52:55.612 --> 52:57.614
- Oh, thanks, man.
- Hey.

52:57.748 --> 53:02.352
You're free to go, and you want
to stay out of trouble, please?

53:02.485 --> 53:03.753
Yes, Officer.

53:03.887 --> 53:05.989
Your muse
is free to go too.

53:16.067 --> 53:18.501
He doesn't even
snore like a human.

53:18.635 --> 53:20.204
That's because
he isn't.

53:22.606 --> 53:24.608
- What?
- Nothing.

53:24.742 --> 53:25.976
- Something.
- I don't know.

53:26.110 --> 53:29.681
My life seems to be
veering off somewhere.

53:31.983 --> 53:34.018
How does he just fall asleep
like that. I don't understand.

53:34.150 --> 53:36.552
He can be manic to the point
of being orbital

53:36.686 --> 53:38.855
and then crash
to the point of narcolepsy.

53:39.456 --> 53:40.757
Does anything help?

53:40.891 --> 53:43.894
In a way, a night
like this probably does.

53:44.027 --> 53:46.530
I don't usually have
nights like this.

53:46.664 --> 53:48.499
Are you having fun?

53:48.632 --> 53:51.369
Oh, god, you think?

53:54.204 --> 53:57.942
Must have been wild
growing up with him.

53:58.074 --> 54:00.677
Yeah, he'd weep like a baby
at my birthday parties

54:00.811 --> 54:02.145
in front of all my friends.

54:02.280 --> 54:03.347
That's sweet.

54:03.481 --> 54:05.215
Not when I was 16.

54:05.349 --> 54:07.751
When I was younger,
he'd go to my parent/teacher conferences

54:07.885 --> 54:09.720
on mescaline and draw pentagrams
on the blackboard

54:09.853 --> 54:12.155
while my mom tried
to distract the teachers.

54:12.289 --> 54:13.858
Yikes.

54:13.990 --> 54:16.092
Well, at least after my mom died,
he didn't have to go those anymore.

54:16.226 --> 54:19.062
I just started negotiating
my own grades.

54:19.197 --> 54:20.831
School wasn't so easy
for me either.

54:20.965 --> 54:23.233
I was always visible
when I tried to, like,

54:23.367 --> 54:25.503
sit in the back
of the class and I was...

54:25.635 --> 54:27.137
Kids tease you?

54:27.271 --> 54:29.707
No, not... I can't tell you
actually. So forget about it.

54:29.840 --> 54:31.208
- Uh, sure you can.
- No, I can't.

54:31.342 --> 54:34.077
Now you have to. In fact,
I think you want to.

54:34.211 --> 54:35.545
It was a really
long time ago.

54:35.679 --> 54:37.948
Okay, then it should
be okay to tell me.

54:38.081 --> 54:40.583
All right, I'll tell you,
but if I tell you,

54:40.717 --> 54:44.154
- you're going to have to marry me or shoot me.
- Deal.

54:46.490 --> 54:47.992
Okay.

54:48.726 --> 54:51.795
One day,
I'm sitting at my desk.

54:51.929 --> 54:53.431
I've never told this
to anybody.

54:53.563 --> 54:57.034
For some reason,
I started thinking about foxes.

54:57.800 --> 54:59.569
Foxes.

54:59.702 --> 55:03.407
For whatever reason, I still
to this day don't know why,

55:03.539 --> 55:05.909
I-I-I-I...

55:06.811 --> 55:09.146
- Keep going.
- I got an erection.

55:09.880 --> 55:12.349
- Thinking about foxes?
- Yeah.

55:14.485 --> 55:15.919
That's sensational.

55:16.052 --> 55:18.221
I'm sitting there. You know,
this is new. What is this?

55:18.355 --> 55:20.358
And I look down
and I'm like "Oh."

55:20.490 --> 55:23.659
So I start playing with it,
and then I look over

55:23.793 --> 55:26.797
and the teacher's
just staring at me,

55:26.931 --> 55:28.432
and because she's
staring at me,

55:28.565 --> 55:30.934
all the kids turn around,
and then they're staring at me.

55:31.068 --> 55:36.039
And I'm just sitting here...
Good times.

55:36.172 --> 55:38.040
You now.

55:38.175 --> 55:39.409
Me what?

55:39.543 --> 55:42.380
You tell me something that
you didn't want to tell me.

55:43.581 --> 55:48.152
Like what was that thing
you always wanted to do.

55:49.786 --> 55:51.254
It's nothing.

55:52.956 --> 55:54.391
Law school.

55:55.525 --> 55:56.860
Law school.

55:57.961 --> 56:00.465
I can totally see that.

56:00.597 --> 56:02.032
What happened?

56:03.601 --> 56:09.440
I don't know. Like,
75,000 kids applied the year I graduated.

56:09.572 --> 56:12.342
You know "Kill all the
lawyers" and all that.

56:14.378 --> 56:15.379
Mmm.

56:15.512 --> 56:18.682
I got turned on thinking
about dolphins once.

56:18.815 --> 56:20.416
That's normal.

56:20.550 --> 56:23.219
You're actually supposed to get
turned on by watching dolphins.

56:23.353 --> 56:24.721
Really?

56:24.855 --> 56:26.590
Yes.

56:26.722 --> 56:28.057
Pull over right here.

56:28.190 --> 56:31.160
Why Mr. Porter,
this is so sudden.

56:31.295 --> 56:33.965
No, this is
where I live.

56:34.998 --> 56:37.367
So this is the street
where you live.

56:43.106 --> 56:46.876
Um, we seem to have
maintained the fox theme,

56:47.010 --> 56:49.045
but mercifully
with a different species.

56:49.179 --> 56:50.146
Uh-huh.

56:50.280 --> 56:52.048
- Well...
- Well...

56:52.182 --> 56:55.385
Thank you
for the ride.

56:55.519 --> 56:56.554
Sure.

56:58.822 --> 57:01.224
For the bail out.

57:04.795 --> 57:06.463

59:20.697 --> 59:22.164
Gavin Rossdale.

59:23.532 --> 59:27.304
He's really cute, but a lot
shorter than I thought he would be.

59:29.306 --> 59:31.342
They're all shorter
than you think, right?

59:32.309 --> 59:33.878
What's the matter with you?

Cory, Cory, Cory, you and I are
going to have lunch on Monday,

59:52.295 --> 59:53.931
and on Tuesday, we make history.

59:54.063 --> 59:58.768
Today the mountains, tomorrow
the world and... and all that.

59:58.902 --> 01:00:00.169
Okay, cool.

01:00:00.304 --> 01:00:02.373
Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie.

01:00:03.907 --> 01:00:06.077
- Sir?
- You disappoint me.

01:00:07.945 --> 01:00:10.614
- Do you want me to...
- Oh, no, no.

01:00:10.748 --> 01:00:12.215
Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie.

01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:14.485
You bullshitted
your Uncle Donny.

01:00:14.617 --> 01:00:16.653
- Really, it's no problem.
- No!

01:00:16.786 --> 01:00:20.589
Please, please. Tommy Mottola is
circling you like a vulture. Don't move.

01:00:20.724 --> 01:00:23.961
I checked with legal,
nothing from the fat bastard.

01:00:24.094 --> 01:00:26.297
Get your ass back
up to Montecito

01:00:26.429 --> 01:00:28.031
and you do
what's necessary,

01:00:28.164 --> 01:00:32.735
or you won't even be
a mail room boy anymore.

01:00:33.469 --> 01:00:34.570
You said that you weren't...

01:00:34.704 --> 01:00:36.773
So where are you from,
darlin'?

01:00:36.907 --> 01:00:37.874
Jersey.

01:00:38.007 --> 01:00:38.974
Huh, not anymore.

01:00:39.108 --> 01:00:41.811
Let's see, Texas, Odessa.

01:00:41.945 --> 01:00:43.147
You were gawky as a girl,

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.984
but lonely until you
discovered Ma Rainey.

01:00:47.117 --> 01:00:48.051
Mmm.

01:00:48.184 --> 01:00:49.652
- Who?
- Ma Rainey.

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.855
This old
Delta Blues singer.

01:00:52.989 --> 01:00:56.793
Why are you here... still?

01:00:56.927 --> 01:00:59.730
Well,
I don't have my car.

01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:01.899
You can take mine...

01:01:02.032 --> 01:01:03.734
- I can take yours.
- ...if you want.

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.503
That's figured out then.

01:01:08.405 --> 01:01:09.807
I think I'll just go.

01:01:14.612 --> 01:01:15.913
- Odessa.
- Texas.

01:01:16.045 --> 01:01:17.513
- Yeah.

It's just amazing.
Come on in.

01:01:54.918 --> 01:01:56.487
I guess there's no such
thing as coincidence.

01:01:56.619 --> 01:01:58.121
No idea what you're
talking about.

01:01:58.255 --> 01:01:59.722
- I really need to speak to your father.
- Shh shh!

01:01:59.856 --> 01:02:01.825
I'm not bullshitting anymore,
and I mean it, goddamn it.

01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:03.193
Charlie!

01:02:07.664 --> 01:02:08.766
How do I look?

01:02:16.039 --> 01:02:17.441
You look great.

01:02:18.909 --> 01:02:19.843
Groovy.

01:02:19.976 --> 01:02:21.679
I'm driving.

01:02:29.753 --> 01:02:31.455

01:02:50.273 --> 01:02:51.307
You seem a little rusty.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.643
Stopped driving back

01:02:52.775 --> 01:02:55.445
when Dylan had his
motorcycle accident, man.

01:02:55.579 --> 01:02:56.780
Wasn't that
all bullshit, though?

01:02:56.913 --> 01:02:58.414
So, I guess
I never stopped driving.

01:02:58.547 --> 01:03:00.917
There used to be only
three things I cared about.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:03.519
- Stay in the lanes.
- <i>My old Chevy Impala...</i>

01:03:03.653 --> 01:03:05.288
There's a red light, so...
Red light.

01:03:05.422 --> 01:03:06.889
- <i>Debbie Garfield.</i>
- Red light, red light!

01:03:07.023 --> 01:03:08.858
<i>...and a guy named Micky Adams.</i>

01:03:08.992 --> 01:03:10.627
Fuck!
What the hell's wrong with you!

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.932
<i>I totaled the Impala...
and uh, Debbie Garfield,</i>

01:03:16.065 --> 01:03:18.735
<i>well, she cut her hair.
She married a lawyer.</i>

01:03:20.103 --> 01:03:23.740
<i>But Micky Adams, I don't know
what happened to him.</i>

01:03:23.873 --> 01:03:26.108
Micky, what the fuck?
What are we doing here?

01:03:26.242 --> 01:03:29.646
<i>There's not a week that goes by where I
don't wonder what happened to Micky Adams.</i>

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.247
<i>So, I think
I'll just ask him.</i>

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.882
Me? I woke him up?

01:03:33.016 --> 01:03:34.985
<i>Hey, Micky, where
the hell you been?</i>

01:03:35.117 --> 01:03:39.056
<i>Dear Mr. Jesus,
I sure hope you're paying attention.</i>

01:03:49.331 --> 01:03:51.433
Welcome back, Micky.

01:03:51.568 --> 01:03:52.769
Micky Adams, everybody!

01:04:19.996 --> 01:04:22.298
We love you, Micky!

01:04:22.431 --> 01:04:24.967
I-I think it helps
if you don't know me.

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.041
I'm sorry.

01:05:22.224 --> 01:05:24.360
Miss, may I borrow
your pen?

01:05:33.836 --> 01:05:34.871
Thank you.

01:06:05.802 --> 01:06:09.673
They were my brother's.
They were too tight.

01:06:22.052 --> 01:06:23.754
I play the piano.

01:06:26.123 --> 01:06:31.394
I know there are notes
that I can't hear. Nobody can.

01:06:32.762 --> 01:06:34.998
I call it "The Angels' Share."

01:06:37.934 --> 01:06:39.635
The Angels' Share.

01:06:39.768 --> 01:06:43.473
If I pray, in their own
sweet-ass time, they will.

01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:47.478
They sure as hell weren't
with me tonight.

01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:56.686
Very clever how you beat me.

01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:00.157
You played music with me.
You gave me hope.

01:07:01.958 --> 01:07:04.894
Believe me, nothing will
kill you faster than hope.

01:07:07.297 --> 01:07:11.034
Mind if I ask you one question
before I never see your face again?

01:07:13.335 --> 01:07:14.737
What's the get?

01:07:18.974 --> 01:07:20.143
The get?

01:07:22.411 --> 01:07:23.413
Yeah, the get.

01:07:23.545 --> 01:07:25.614
What's in it for you?

01:07:25.748 --> 01:07:28.985
I signed the thing.
What do you get?

01:07:29.119 --> 01:07:32.689
I get to be an A & R guy.

01:07:35.992 --> 01:07:37.561
Golly-gee.

01:07:42.032 --> 01:07:43.066
Look...

01:07:44.333 --> 01:07:47.971
this is my commencement
address to you, Sparky.

01:07:49.539 --> 01:07:51.575
You know what music is?

01:07:52.643 --> 01:07:58.347
Yearning for something,
someone so bad,

01:07:58.947 --> 01:08:01.150
but never quite gettin' it.

01:08:02.652 --> 01:08:04.586
The Sistine Chapel.

01:08:05.722 --> 01:08:09.493
God's hand to man's,
not quite touching it...

01:08:10.927 --> 01:08:12.229
reaching.

01:08:14.998 --> 01:08:17.868
The music is the space between.

01:08:21.404 --> 01:08:23.140
Between love and hate...

01:08:24.707 --> 01:08:26.844
faith and fear...

01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:29.212
man and woman...

01:08:30.113 --> 01:08:31.548
life and death...

01:08:32.582 --> 01:08:34.151
heaven and hell.

01:08:36.987 --> 01:08:39.788
Between the thing
that happens all the time...

01:08:41.323 --> 01:08:43.693
when it is revealed why.

01:08:49.365 --> 01:08:51.935
Music is the space between.

01:09:01.344 --> 01:09:03.613
Space between you and me.

01:09:07.149 --> 01:09:08.585
Good night, moon.

01:09:25.835 --> 01:09:27.104
Yes.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:32.307
What we have here
is the sentimental education

01:09:32.442 --> 01:09:35.578
of young Charles Porter.

01:09:36.912 --> 01:09:39.180
You're that asshole
that took my picture.

01:09:39.850 --> 01:09:41.952
I am that very asshole, man.

01:09:48.358 --> 01:09:51.528
So, you're the famous
Micky Adams nut.

01:09:51.661 --> 01:09:54.463
Whatever there is to know
about Micky Adams,

01:09:54.597 --> 01:09:58.000
I know it,
and it weighs on my head,

01:09:58.701 --> 01:10:00.168
and it fucking
heavies my heart.

01:10:00.302 --> 01:10:03.573
- You follow me?
- Y-You go through his garbage. Why?

01:10:03.706 --> 01:10:07.877
Because Micky Adams is
a fucking genius, man.

01:10:08.011 --> 01:10:11.915
You have no fucking idea the
shit that he used to sing about.

01:10:13.548 --> 01:10:15.351
I mean, it kept us alive.

01:10:19.255 --> 01:10:20.824
What happened to him?

01:10:22.524 --> 01:10:24.126
He got too close, man.

01:10:24.895 --> 01:10:26.196
Too close to what?

01:10:26.328 --> 01:10:29.032
What are you, a fucking idiot?
The flame, man.

01:10:29.164 --> 01:10:32.435
And he got scared,
and he beat a hasty retreat.

01:10:32.569 --> 01:10:33.503
They all do.

01:10:33.636 --> 01:10:35.339
Who? Who all?

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:39.742
Shakespeare sold
fucking real estate, man.

01:10:39.876 --> 01:10:42.646
Salinger's hunkered down
in some bunker.

01:10:42.779 --> 01:10:44.348
Lennon hid out
in the Dakota.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.250
And Morrison and Joplin
and Hendrix and Cobain,

01:10:47.384 --> 01:10:48.885
they all joined the 27 club,

01:10:49.019 --> 01:10:51.154
and Micky Adams went
to fucking bed.

01:10:52.287 --> 01:10:53.956
I know his Joy
thinks he went nuts

01:10:54.090 --> 01:10:55.492
because people
forgot about him.

01:10:55.625 --> 01:10:58.060
With all due respect,
she doesn't know shit either.

01:10:59.561 --> 01:11:01.430
Joy, you mean Julia?

01:11:01.564 --> 01:11:04.334
Micky Adams went nuts
because he didn't think

01:11:04.466 --> 01:11:07.636
he had anything left to say,
but he does, and I fucking know it.

01:11:07.770 --> 01:11:11.740
And I stand around in the dark outside
of his house hoping to hear it.

01:11:11.875 --> 01:11:14.944
I keep that fucking
piano in tune, dude.

01:11:15.077 --> 01:11:19.115
And all these years,
nothing. Dick.

01:11:20.783 --> 01:11:24.786
And then one day,
I'm prowling around,

01:11:24.921 --> 01:11:30.961
and I hear it, and I run,
and I look, and I see you.

01:11:31.994 --> 01:11:35.965
You and him.
Fucking music, man!

01:11:37.333 --> 01:11:39.001
Such music.

01:11:40.069 --> 01:11:42.038
You were sent here, man.

01:11:42.171 --> 01:11:43.639
You know what?

01:11:43.773 --> 01:11:45.342
You're the chosen one.

01:11:48.811 --> 01:11:51.280
You, man.

01:11:54.317 --> 01:11:55.786
You, man.

01:12:31.387 --> 01:12:34.923
Why don't you just listen to me?
I knew this would happen.

01:12:35.057 --> 01:12:37.393
Ebb and flow, babe.
What goes around...

01:12:37.527 --> 01:12:38.860
Exactly.

01:12:38.994 --> 01:12:40.595
Everything old is...

01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:42.197
Exactly.

01:12:42.332 --> 01:12:45.969
The cyclical nature
of business is...

01:12:46.569 --> 01:12:47.770
Exactly.

01:12:47.904 --> 01:12:49.238
I'm so there.

01:12:49.372 --> 01:12:52.408
I've already got my man
working on it.

01:12:54.277 --> 01:12:57.480
When have I not delivered?
Answer, never.

01:13:00.817 --> 01:13:02.519
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

01:13:02.652 --> 01:13:03.953
Hey.

01:13:04.087 --> 01:13:05.522
That was New York.

01:13:12.828 --> 01:13:14.497
- He signed it.
- He didn't.

01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:16.632
He didn't sign diddly.

01:13:16.765 --> 01:13:18.367
That was New York.

01:13:18.501 --> 01:13:22.672
Apparently, there's
a picture of Micky naked.

01:13:22.805 --> 01:13:25.174
Him and some guy
whose johnson has become

01:13:25.307 --> 01:13:27.409
a bit of a joke
on the interweb.

01:13:28.211 --> 01:13:29.378
Okay.

01:13:29.511 --> 01:13:30.646
Little tiny...

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:35.451
And then there's this story
about Micky getting arrested

01:13:35.585 --> 01:13:36.786
for possession of a gun.

01:13:36.918 --> 01:13:38.954
I mean, this is madness,
and all of a sudden,

01:13:39.087 --> 01:13:40.923
people are waking
up to the fact

01:13:41.056 --> 01:13:42.858
that Micky Adams
is still around.

01:13:42.992 --> 01:13:45.561
They want Micky to present
an award at the Grammys,

01:13:45.694 --> 01:13:47.929
maybe even sing
one of his songs.

01:13:48.064 --> 01:13:50.834
So, I want you
to go up to Montecito

01:13:50.966 --> 01:13:52.734
and you get
Micky in shape.

01:13:52.868 --> 01:13:54.871
You work with him.
You've got a week.

01:13:55.005 --> 01:13:57.407
He trusts you.
You can make this happen.

01:13:57.539 --> 01:13:58.841
He signed it though.

01:13:58.975 --> 01:14:01.444
You know the moment that
you walked in my office...

01:14:01.578 --> 01:14:03.046
Stop, stop right there.

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.817
I knew that there was
something special.

01:14:07.817 --> 01:14:09.485
Okay, but I...

01:14:12.387 --> 01:14:13.122
Is that, uh...

01:14:13.256 --> 01:14:14.990
Yeah, yeah, that's...

01:14:17.394 --> 01:14:18.360
Okay.

01:14:18.493 --> 01:14:20.829
- Listen, she was your find, right?
- Yes.

01:14:20.962 --> 01:14:22.630
Then you've got
to tell her.

01:14:22.765 --> 01:14:24.634
I have to tell her what?

01:14:24.768 --> 01:14:28.804
That it's not happening.
I mean... Listen to her.

01:14:28.938 --> 01:14:30.273
She doesn't have it.

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.408
Like, not even a little.

01:14:33.542 --> 01:14:34.643
Yeah.

01:14:34.777 --> 01:14:37.180
You can actually smell
the desperation on her skin.

01:14:37.313 --> 01:14:40.016
Listen, that chick will be
nothing but a steamer trunk

01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:42.718
full of stomach troubles,
and those are the worst kind.

01:14:42.851 --> 01:14:45.454
- Wait, I don't know...
- You need to do some ab work there.

01:14:45.587 --> 01:14:48.123
For a young man your age,
you don't want that stuff.

01:14:48.257 --> 01:14:49.658
You got it all.
You're a young guy.

01:14:49.792 --> 01:14:51.060
Wait a minute.
Are you leaving?

01:14:51.194 --> 01:14:53.163
Hey.

01:14:53.296 --> 01:14:54.797
What do you want me
to tell her?

01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:55.931
What am I supposed
to say?

01:14:56.065 --> 01:14:57.434
Oh, you'll think of something.

01:14:57.567 --> 01:14:59.603

01:17:10.265 --> 01:17:11.634

Oh, wow, really?

01:17:13.435 --> 01:17:15.637
That's great, and I can't help you.
He's gone.

01:17:17.407 --> 01:17:18.708
- Where did he go?
- See, if I knew that,

01:17:18.841 --> 01:17:21.544
do you think I'd be
calling you motherfucker?

01:17:21.677 --> 01:17:25.280

motherfucker in casual conversation?

01:17:25.414 --> 01:17:27.315
I don't know where
he went!

01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:31.453
I woke up to check on him like
I always do, and he was gone.

01:17:31.587 --> 01:17:33.456
Maybe he's got
a girlfriend somewhere.

01:17:36.557 --> 01:17:39.229
Would a man who's going out
to get laid write this?

01:17:40.363 --> 01:17:42.698
"Goodbye. All is discovered."

01:17:42.832 --> 01:17:43.900

01:17:44.033 --> 01:17:45.535
Isn't that a line from the song?

01:17:45.667 --> 01:17:48.336
I told you it's not about me.
It's a suicide note.

01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:49.971
I know it.
I tried calling the cops,

01:17:50.105 --> 01:17:52.240
but they won't consider
him missing for 24 hours.

01:17:52.373 --> 01:17:55.010
Julia, let's not leap
to any conclusions here.

01:17:55.144 --> 01:17:57.746
I'm totally not leaping.
You know him.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.682
You're here, so you may as well
make yourself useful.

01:18:10.158 --> 01:18:11.760
- Where are we going?
- I have no idea.

01:18:11.894 --> 01:18:14.197
Never been there.
I hear it's very relaxing.

01:18:14.329 --> 01:18:15.698
This is no time
for fucking jokes.

01:18:15.831 --> 01:18:17.667
You know everything was
fine before you showed up.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everything was fucking peachy.

01:18:21.104 --> 01:18:22.872
The two of you living
in that loony bin.

01:18:23.005 --> 01:18:24.039
Hmm, guess what?

01:18:24.172 --> 01:18:26.443
He is crazy.
He's not hiding.

01:18:27.444 --> 01:18:29.479
You know
who I think's hiding is you.

01:18:29.612 --> 01:18:31.447
Oh, please, as if you
understand anything truthful.

01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:33.181
- You wouldn't know the truth...
- Oh, the truth!

01:18:33.315 --> 01:18:35.317
Yeah, you should try it.
God, you'd make a hell of a lawyer

01:18:35.451 --> 01:18:37.086
if you could see the proof
in front of you.

01:18:37.219 --> 01:18:38.753
You're all he has?

01:18:38.887 --> 01:18:40.890
How about admitting that he's
all you have for starters?

01:18:41.023 --> 01:18:44.293
You're just afraid of
what else might be out there.

01:18:44.426 --> 01:18:46.728
You know what, Charlie Porter?
You're right.

01:18:46.862 --> 01:18:50.300
I have never been as scared in
my whole life as I am right now.

01:18:52.501 --> 01:18:54.137
You were right too...

01:18:55.703 --> 01:18:59.442
'cause I don't understand
jack shit.

01:19:05.948 --> 01:19:07.617
Whoa.

01:19:12.854 --> 01:19:14.189
What the hell?

01:19:14.323 --> 01:19:15.924
Oh, yeah man,
I just thought, you know,

01:19:16.059 --> 01:19:18.828
if I brought his llama back,
it might you know, help.

01:19:18.961 --> 01:19:21.364
That was extremely thoughtful of
you, Cameroon,

01:19:21.497 --> 01:19:23.532
but I'm afraid
my father has fled.

01:19:23.666 --> 01:19:25.434
Bummer. Why?

01:19:25.568 --> 01:19:27.604
Because all
is discovered.

01:19:28.237 --> 01:19:29.838
I get that, man. Yeah.

01:19:29.971 --> 01:19:33.208
You get it? You understand that?
I don't get it.

01:19:33.342 --> 01:19:34.976
I don't fucking get
a fucking thing, dude.

01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:38.146
I don't fucking get it.
I don't fucking get this.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.881
I don't fucking get it.

01:19:40.015 --> 01:19:41.116

01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:43.286

I don't know
what's going on, man.

01:19:51.659 --> 01:19:53.496
I'm from
the fucking valley.

01:19:53.628 --> 01:19:55.430
Before I came to
this goddamn fucking house,

01:19:55.564 --> 01:19:58.768
I knew who I was, where I was going
and how the hell I was gonna get there.

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:01.837
Now, fuck man, I don't
get a motherfucking,
