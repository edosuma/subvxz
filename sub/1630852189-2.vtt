00:00.400 --> 00:05.200
Ifan Williams. What was he like?
Alright. Flashed his cash a bit.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.150
The locals aren't keen on that.

00:07.425 --> 00:10.600
See you tonight.
You've got your priorities right!

00:11.250 --> 00:13.750
Have you even told her
about the interview?

00:14.400 --> 00:16.175
Fuck-fuck! Heads! Heads!

00:16.475 --> 00:18.450
You could've killed someone!

00:18.725 --> 00:21.350
Leave. My. Things. Alone.

00:21.625 --> 00:23.350
How many times must I tell you?

00:23.625 --> 00:28.250
I need time to work out
how I'll tell my little boy...

00:28.525 --> 00:29.625
..his father's dead.

01:37.450 --> 01:39.300
Sorry. I tried to be quiet.

01:39.425 --> 01:40.425
That's OK.

01:40.550 --> 01:41.725
I was awake anyway.

01:42.225 --> 01:44.425
There's coffee there.
Thank you.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.575
Did you get any sleep?
I didn't even hear you come up.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.400
Yeah, a bit.

01:49.525 --> 01:53.375
Pointless lecturing you.
We both know you won't listen.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.525
CAR HORN
My taxi's here.

01:56.575 --> 01:59.700
Can I come over tonight?
Sure. Everything OK?

02:00.350 --> 02:01.650
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

02:02.150 --> 02:03.275
See you later.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.700
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

02:53.725 --> 02:55.725
KNOCK ON DOOR

02:58.300 --> 03:00.300
HE OPENS THE DOOR

03:00.700 --> 03:03.175
Come on. You can't be late again.

03:05.625 --> 03:07.175
I'll see you there.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.525
Nice try! I'll wait.

03:08.650 --> 03:09.650
Get a move on!

03:24.600 --> 03:25.675
Let's go!

03:33.600 --> 03:36.350
Dion, come on!
I don't want to be late!

03:52.425 --> 03:53.750
What's up with her?

03:55.450 --> 03:56.575
Don't ask.

04:16.575 --> 04:18.200
(VAUGHAN) OK...

04:18.475 --> 04:22.350
..as you can see from the PM report,
cause of death was asphyxiation.

04:22.625 --> 04:27.450
Bruising and abrasions to the torso
consistent with a severe beating.

04:27.625 --> 04:31.225
Blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

04:31.350 --> 04:34.325
The victim was last seen
leaving the club...

04:34.450 --> 04:36.525
..at 11.00pm on Tuesday night.

04:37.225 --> 04:42.500
The PM report puts time of death
at between 11.00pm and 1.00am...

04:43.150 --> 04:44.575
..so it's a small window.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.325
Thank you, DS Vaughan. Where are we?

04:47.450 --> 04:50.475
Just finished going through
the PM report.

04:50.725 --> 04:51.725
Good morning.

04:53.625 --> 04:58.425
Our preliminary investigations
have uncovered some information...

04:58.700 --> 05:01.175
..about Ifan Williams's farm.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.650
There were reports
of animal neglect.

05:04.150 --> 05:06.700
A number of animals
were destroyed...

05:07.325 --> 05:10.500
..in the months
before Ifan Williams's death...

05:10.625 --> 05:14.200
..and selling restrictions
were put in place.

05:14.325 --> 05:16.200
Anything useful from the vet?

05:16.500 --> 05:20.250
Only that she'd been called in
to assess the situation.

05:20.525 --> 05:23.700
Do we know who made the allegation?
It was done anonymously.

05:24.350 --> 05:27.750
OK. Any sign of the CCTV footage
from the rugby club?

05:28.400 --> 05:30.700
Not yet.
Phone them again.

05:31.350 --> 05:34.225
We need it ASAP please.
Yes, Ma'am.

05:34.350 --> 05:38.250
You have a list of everyone present
at the club that night.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.200
Follow them all up today...

05:40.325 --> 05:43.650
..and broaden the house-to-house
to the wider estate.

05:44.150 --> 05:48.550
This was a violent attack and the
perpetrator is out there somewhere.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.675
Let's find that person. Thank you.

05:59.550 --> 06:00.550
Thank you.

06:01.982 --> 06:02.693
Good morning.

06:02.740 --> 06:05.625
Good morning.
Twenty Originals, please.

06:07.375 --> 06:10.475
I thought you'd packed it in.
You and me both.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.200
LOCAL MAN FOUND DEAD

06:19.225 --> 06:21.300
Thank you.
You're welcome.

06:34.325 --> 06:35.325
PHONE BEEPS

06:37.675 --> 06:41.200
I'll stay with him if you like.
He'll be alright.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.275
You're one of Lea's friends
aren't you?

06:45.300 --> 06:46.450
Might be...

06:48.325 --> 06:49.450
She's a nice girl.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.150
A lot going for her.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
HE SNEERS

06:56.675 --> 07:00.425
I've always believed
we should lift people up...

07:01.550 --> 07:03.475
..not drag them down.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.225
Just mind your own business, yeah?

07:09.675 --> 07:12.350
Nobody wants your help around here.

08:07.575 --> 08:08.575
Good morning.

08:08.700 --> 08:11.250
Sorry. I wasn't expecting you.
Is Mair here?

08:11.625 --> 08:15.200
There was no-one at the bungalow.
Yes, she's inside.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.675
They want to speak to you.

08:27.225 --> 08:31.175
This won't take long.
You're obviously expecting people.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.450
Come on, Guto. Let's get changed.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.500
I'm sorry.
We know this is a difficult time.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.300
How are you coping?

08:45.375 --> 08:46.750
It's better if I'm busy.

08:47.250 --> 08:51.300
Neighbours... people will
start to call in the next few days.

08:51.425 --> 08:52.700
There's so much to do.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.525
So much to be arranged.

08:54.650 --> 08:56.250
Please, take a seat.

09:05.650 --> 09:08.550
We wanted to ask you
a few questions.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.200
Of course.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.225
How long have you lived here,
Mrs Williams?

09:14.350 --> 09:17.225
The farm was in Dai,
my husband's family.

09:17.525 --> 09:21.375
We got married in 1972
and I moved here straightaway.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.300
That was the done thing
in those days.

09:25.175 --> 09:28.575
I noticed the cups and the rosettes.

09:29.650 --> 09:32.575
Were those for the stock?
Yes.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.300
They say there are
two kinds of farmers.

09:35.425 --> 09:38.525
Those who like machines
and those who like animals.

09:39.150 --> 09:40.575
Dai was a stockman.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.550
It was in his nature.

09:44.275 --> 09:47.200
Breeding animals like that
is an art.

09:47.575 --> 09:50.250
Knowing every animal's tendencies.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.400
Its strengths and its weaknesses.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.575
We saw a report...

09:57.275 --> 09:58.500
..from the Ministry.

09:59.625 --> 10:03.675
A report about cattle
being destroyed about a year ago.

10:04.325 --> 10:06.425
What has that got to do with this?

10:06.550 --> 10:10.500
We're trying to get a sense
of Ifan's life.

10:11.150 --> 10:12.275
His state of mind.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.425
He forgot to vaccinate the herd,
that's all.

10:15.550 --> 10:17.300
It's easily done.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.500
There was a parasite on the land.

10:20.625 --> 10:21.700
It gets wet here.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.150
There was nothing to be done.

10:24.700 --> 10:28.175
People are quick to judge
but it hurt us too.

10:30.200 --> 10:34.400
We lost a lot of the bloodlines
that Dai bred over 50 years.

10:36.700 --> 10:40.575
A lifetime's work gone
in less than an hour.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.650
They shot them on the yard.

10:46.350 --> 10:48.150
That must have been hard.

10:48.275 --> 10:51.250
There was a commotion
as they herded them in.

10:52.325 --> 10:53.525
So noisy.

10:54.675 --> 10:56.425
And then silence.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.225
I'll never forget it.

11:02.650 --> 11:04.550
Dafydd was beside himself.

11:05.150 --> 11:08.425
Dafydd?
He used to work here.

11:11.275 --> 11:12.650
He worked here...

11:13.325 --> 11:15.225
..for forty years.

11:15.350 --> 11:17.150
He was almost part of the family.

11:18.525 --> 11:20.325
SHE SIGHS

11:22.350 --> 11:26.275
Did you bring a tractor for Granny?
I'm sorry.

11:27.350 --> 11:29.300
We won't keep you any longer.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.500
Do you know
where we can find Dafydd?

11:34.625 --> 11:36.350
Where he always is.

11:37.550 --> 11:40.300
In his mother's house
at Rhyd-y-Perren.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.725
Thank you.

11:42.525 --> 11:44.325
We'll see ourselves out.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.500

HUSHED CONVERSATIONS

13:16.250 --> 13:18.525
Everyone had a cup of tea?
Yes.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.225
What did they want?

13:25.425 --> 13:26.550
The police.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.375
This is not the time or the place.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.475
KNOCK ON DOOR

13:45.300 --> 13:47.300
DOOR OPENS

13:48.175 --> 13:49.300
John!

13:55.150 --> 13:56.175
I had to come.

13:56.450 --> 13:58.300
Yes, of course.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.325
Go through.

14:13.750 --> 14:16.275
These numbers aren't stacking up.

14:16.550 --> 14:20.700
They've delivered more bales
of wood shavings than we ordered.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.700
Do you want me to ring the driver?
Let me double check it first.

14:26.175 --> 14:28.275
I might have just made a mistake.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.300
You're quiet today.

15:01.425 --> 15:02.475
Are you OK?

15:07.175 --> 15:10.650
Is that hawk still hanging around?

15:13.175 --> 15:14.575
Maybe we should look it up.

15:14.700 --> 15:17.275
There must be a way
we can get rid of it.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.375
I don't want to hurt it.

15:19.625 --> 15:22.500
No but you don't want it
to get at the birds.

15:24.325 --> 15:26.575
Nope. Definitely a couple too many.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.625
I'll ring the driver.
He can come back for them.

15:31.225 --> 15:35.425
Or you could take them home for
your pigeons. No-one needs to know.

15:36.475 --> 15:38.425
Are you sure you're OK, Glyn?

15:39.150 --> 15:40.300
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:43.650 --> 15:46.325
OK, I'll put
those two bales aside...

15:46.625 --> 15:49.725
..and I'll call the driver
to come pick them up.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.200
HE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR

16:37.625 --> 16:38.625
Yes?

16:39.350 --> 16:41.700
DS Owen Vaughan.
This is DCI Cadi John.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.375
Can we have a word?

16:43.650 --> 16:45.150
Yes. Come in.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.600
Come through.

16:53.675 --> 16:54.675
Take a seat.

17:00.250 --> 17:02.400
We're sorry to call unannounced.

17:04.175 --> 17:06.375
Do you have any idea why we're here?

17:07.225 --> 17:09.500
I'm guessing it's about Ifan.

17:10.750 --> 17:13.325
You've known the family for years.

17:14.400 --> 17:18.525
Yes, I started working there when I
was in my twenties, many moons ago.

17:20.450 --> 17:24.625
There were animal welfare issues
on the farm recently.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.600
Someone made a complaint.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.300
Was that person you?

17:30.425 --> 17:31.425
No...

17:31.550 --> 17:34.700
..but I would have done it
if nobody else had.

17:35.675 --> 17:39.200
Farmers like Ifan
give us all a bad name.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.675
In what way?

17:42.500 --> 17:43.500
He lied.

17:43.625 --> 17:47.400
Saying he's vaccinated them
but he hadn't.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.375
He was negligent?

17:49.500 --> 17:53.175
He shouldn't have been farming.
His heart wasn't in it.

17:53.450 --> 17:55.500
Why didn't he just leave?

17:56.300 --> 17:57.450
Just like that?

17:58.525 --> 18:00.575
His father farmed there...

18:00.700 --> 18:04.575
..and so did his grandfather
and his great-grandfather.

18:04.700 --> 18:08.750
You left there a year ago?
Yes.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.650
Can I ask why?

18:13.350 --> 18:16.500
He said I stole some money
but I didn't.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.425
Why would he do that?

18:20.225 --> 18:22.150
He wanted me out of the way.

18:22.425 --> 18:25.750
I didn't think he was up to the job
and he knew it.

18:28.425 --> 18:32.300
It was like I was his conscience,
standing there.

18:35.350 --> 18:37.650
Where were you
the night before last?

18:40.525 --> 18:41.600
I didn't do it.

18:42.450 --> 18:44.375
Nevertheless, I have to ask.

18:44.675 --> 18:46.625
Where were you?
I was here.

18:47.300 --> 18:50.750
Can anyone vouch for that?
What do you think?

18:54.750 --> 18:58.550
We need to do a DNA swab test,
if that's alright with you.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.450
Just to rule you out.

19:37.650 --> 19:39.250
I'm sorry he's dead.

19:39.675 --> 19:40.675
I really am.

19:41.350 --> 19:43.450
I had nothing to do with it.

19:45.525 --> 19:49.175
I've suffered enough,
thanks to that family.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.200
I won't let it happen again.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.425
Lea?

21:42.675 --> 21:43.675
Sorry.

22:00.225 --> 22:02.275
It's why we leave the door open.

22:03.250 --> 22:04.525
I don't even believe.

22:11.625 --> 22:14.475
The church is more than God.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.150
It's about people...

22:18.725 --> 22:20.350
..a community.

22:20.725 --> 22:22.625
I suppose it's a space to be.

22:24.425 --> 22:25.425
To listen.

22:25.550 --> 22:30.475
I thought I was getting to grips
with everything that happened.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.525
It's like things
are trying to pull me back.

22:34.650 --> 22:37.225
Dragging me back.

22:39.725 --> 22:40.725
Lea...

22:41.525 --> 22:44.650
..you've shown remarkable strength.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.750
You witnessed something terrible.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.150
Your father went to prison.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.225
And yet...

22:55.650 --> 22:58.150
..you get up every day...

22:58.275 --> 23:00.225
..and you try.

23:10.150 --> 23:14.675
Does your father know about
everything you've achieved so far...

23:17.625 --> 23:19.725
..being on the programme?

23:26.325 --> 23:28.400
Have you seen him recently?

23:35.525 --> 23:38.400
If it's the money for the train...
It's not that.

23:38.525 --> 23:40.150
It's just...

get the vestry ready.

24:01.375 --> 24:03.225
You can help me if you like.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.625
It's up to you.

24:08.450 --> 24:09.675
I'd better get back.

24:13.350 --> 24:14.350
OK.

24:20.550 --> 24:22.175
There's no rush.

24:24.150 --> 24:25.425
Take your time.

25:19.625 --> 25:20.625
Sion!

25:21.475 --> 25:23.550
Downstairs, now!

25:57.275 --> 25:58.650
Here he is - Sion Thomas.

26:01.475 --> 26:03.425
Just some routine questions.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.225
I'm PC Gwawr Daniels
and this is PC Ryan Davies.

26:08.625 --> 26:12.475
I'm sure you've heard about
the murder of Ifan Williams?

26:12.600 --> 26:16.700
He was last seen on Monday the
8th of February at the rugby club.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.650
We're talking to everyone
who was there.

26:20.150 --> 26:23.225
Can you confirm you were at the club
that night?

26:23.350 --> 26:25.750
Yes. I went there for a drink
after work.

26:27.550 --> 26:30.700
I went there around half seven
and I was home by nine.

26:31.350 --> 26:33.250
Can someone vouch for that?

26:33.375 --> 26:34.550
My brother. Glyn.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.650
He's got learning difficulties.

26:40.325 --> 26:41.625
I'm his carer.

26:41.750 --> 26:44.475
I have to make sure
I'm not out too late.

26:45.450 --> 26:47.500
Did you know Ifan Williams?

26:48.225 --> 26:49.300
I knew who he was.

26:50.500 --> 26:53.225
Everyone knows everyone around here.

26:53.350 --> 26:55.200
We went to the same school.

26:55.325 --> 26:59.675
He was two or three years older
than me. Same year as my brother.

27:00.175 --> 27:01.650
What was he like at school?

27:04.500 --> 27:05.750
Dunno.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.200
Like everyone else I suppose.

27:09.325 --> 27:12.475
Was there any trouble at the club?
Not when I was there.

27:13.350 --> 27:17.200
Like I said, I was only there
for a quick drink after work.

27:17.325 --> 27:18.700
I didn't talk to anyone.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.225
OK. We won't keep you any longer.

27:21.525 --> 27:23.275
Thank you for your time.

All those years
working for the same family...

27:58.675 --> 28:01.300

28:01.425 --> 28:03.425
Dafydd?
Mm.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.550
It's got to rankle...

28:06.225 --> 28:09.400
..losing your job, your reputation,
your purpose.

28:09.525 --> 28:11.375
Do you think he's involved?

28:13.175 --> 28:15.275
He's certainly got a motive.

28:15.575 --> 28:18.450
Let's keep an eye on his house.

28:19.250 --> 28:21.350
Check on his comings and goings.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.675
I know the PNC was clear...

28:25.325 --> 28:26.750
..but check with the LIO...

28:27.250 --> 28:31.625
..to see if they've got reports of
juvenile delinquency involving Ifan.

29:00.425 --> 29:02.300
No, of course I'm pleased.

29:02.425 --> 29:04.250
It was a tough interview.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.625
And it's a yes, of course.

29:12.750 --> 29:16.725
If you could let me have a few days
to talk it over with my Super...

29:17.225 --> 29:19.575
..and then we can start
on the paperwork.

John. I was in school with Ifan.

30:22.175 --> 30:25.350
Are they any closer to finding out
what happened?

30:32.650 --> 30:34.700
He did alright for himself.

30:38.325 --> 30:40.750
He always did
punch above his weight.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.700
I never thought
he'd be a family man.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.175
How many kids did he have?

30:54.300 --> 30:55.325
We have one son.

30:55.450 --> 30:58.200
Somebody's looking after him today.

30:58.325 --> 31:00.700
I thought this show
would be too much for him.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.600
People just want to
pay their respects.

31:08.175 --> 31:11.150
You should be grateful
they turned up at all.

31:12.150 --> 31:17.225
Will there be a public funeral for
those who couldn't make it today?

31:17.500 --> 31:19.350

31:20.225 --> 31:21.375

Get out.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.650

they'd leave us in peace.

31:32.450 --> 31:35.425
Please don't feel you have to leave.
It's alright, Mair.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.300
He picked a good one.
Get out!

31:43.550 --> 31:46.325

Thank you for calling.

I wasn't expecting it.

34:40.150 --> 34:43.375
We need everyone's focus
on the case at the moment.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.500

36:19.500 --> 36:21.550

36:22.250 --> 36:24.625

in their heads.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.275
But they go miles away
when they race.

36:28.550 --> 36:30.675
They still know where home is.

36:31.175 --> 36:32.175
They feel it.

36:34.275 --> 36:37.175
What a nice instinct to have.

42:30.625 --> 42:34.525
Why? You didn't talk to me
about applying for the job.

42:35.175 --> 42:39.325
You didn't even ask for my opinion
before you accepted the job...

42:39.450 --> 42:41.625

talk to me now?

42:44.625 --> 42:46.575

45:52.700 --> 45:53.700
Of course.

45:54.700 --> 45:55.700
It's just...

45:57.400 --> 45:59.400
..a sudden death like that...

46:00.450 --> 46:02.400
..can trigger things.

46:04.325 --> 46:05.575
Memories.

46:08.425 --> 46:09.700
I hope you don't mind.

46:10.525 --> 46:12.400
I'm really tired.

46:13.225 --> 46:14.475
Of course.

46:15.750 --> 46:17.700
It's been a long day...

46:19.425 --> 46:21.150
..for all of us.

46:23.175 --> 46:25.350
Thanks for the tea, Glyn.

46:39.400 --> 46:42.475
Your mother wasn't the type
to hold a grudge...

46:44.275 --> 46:46.175
..to hold on to bitterness.

46:46.300 --> 46:49.625
She would've wanted you to forgive
and move on.

46:50.450 --> 46:52.500
That's what she would've done.

46:52.625 --> 46:56.700
What are you trying to say?
Why would you say that now?

46:57.200 --> 46:58.425
I just want you to know...

46:58.700 --> 47:00.575
..I'm thinking of you...

47:01.450 --> 47:03.250
..and I'm here...

47:04.300 --> 47:05.750
..if you need to talk.

47:06.400 --> 47:07.525
You've said that.

47:09.725 --> 47:11.350
We know that.

47:16.175 --> 47:18.375
If there's nothing else...

47:19.250 --> 47:20.250
No.

47:20.375 --> 47:21.375
Nothing.

47:25.450 --> 47:27.250
Well... goodnight, Sion.

47:46.700 --> 47:47.700
Hiya.

47:49.375 --> 47:51.325
I was going through the CCTV.

47:51.450 --> 47:54.675
At 10.36pm Ifan Williams goes out
for a cigarette.

47:55.175 --> 47:56.550
I don't blame him.

47:58.150 --> 47:59.150
Watch.

48:08.400 --> 48:11.150
NO SOUND ON THE CCTV

48:21.250 --> 48:22.325
Do we have a name?

48:22.700 --> 48:24.400
Piotr Korecki.

48:25.350 --> 48:29.250
A Polish national. A group of them
are working at Awel Fan.

48:31.275 --> 48:33.175
We'd better bring him in...

48:34.275 --> 48:35.550
..now.
