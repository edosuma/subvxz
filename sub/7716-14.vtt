WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:03.004
Ho-ho!

00:03.088 --> 00:05.256
Look who's back reporting for duty.
Hey, guys.

00:06.091 --> 00:07.258
Hey.
Hi.

00:07.509 --> 00:08.927
Pam! Ha!

00:09.010 --> 00:10.887
Look what I can do now that
she's no longer pregnant!

00:10.970 --> 00:12.347
Bam! Bam! Bam! Pam!

00:12.722 --> 00:13.932
Are you glad
to be back?

00:14.265 --> 00:17.060
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I could have
used another week, or three.

00:17.143 --> 00:19.270
You still had eight
weeks more than we did.

00:19.437 --> 00:21.773
Well, it's not
exactly a vacation.

00:21.856 --> 00:25.318
Hello, everyone! Remember?
Little old me. Hi.

00:25.402 --> 00:27.237
What are you doing here?
You just had our baby.

00:27.320 --> 00:32.617
Our collective Dunder Mifflin
family baby four days ago.

00:32.951 --> 00:34.202
I wanted to come
back to work.

00:34.285 --> 00:38.581
Not everybody needs some long,
luxurious, Parisian maternity leave.

00:39.124 --> 00:41.000
Damn, girl! Your body!
What?

00:41.209 --> 00:42.877
Angela, you
look amazing.

00:43.253 --> 00:46.506
Really? I feel like
this big rhinoceros.

00:47.173 --> 00:50.468
Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for
covering for me, so I made some treats.

00:50.552 --> 00:52.387
I've got brownies
and magic cookie bars.

00:52.470 --> 00:53.972
Mm-mm-mm.

00:54.848 --> 00:58.685
Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them
and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts.

00:58.768 --> 01:00.311
You're allergic to
walnuts, right, Kevin?

01:00.562 --> 01:02.647
Extremely, but I'm going
to fight through it.

01:03.356 --> 01:05.692
It's okay, Angela.
I have mommy brain, too.

01:05.984 --> 01:07.444
I don't know
what that is, Pam.

01:07.527 --> 01:10.155
I made a batch with no nuts, special
for you, Kevin. Right here.

01:10.697 --> 01:12.031
When did you find time
to do all this?

01:12.115 --> 01:14.325
Babies sleep a lot, Pam,
if you feed them enough.

01:15.368 --> 01:16.995
Brownie, Pam?

01:21.833 --> 01:23.209
Thank you.

01:25.086 --> 01:27.172
Oh, my gosh.
It's really good.

01:27.505 --> 01:29.549
I wouldn't know.
I'm watching my weight.

01:33.261 --> 01:36.765
Say, guys, you know what's an even
more useful treat is cash. So...

01:36.890 --> 01:39.684
Nope. It's over. No. Okay. We
wanted to say thank you...

01:49.235 --> 01:51.362
Dwight, I have exciting
news for you. What?

01:52.947 --> 01:54.240
I think you're
going to like it.

01:54.324 --> 01:55.658
You can't tantalize me.

01:55.742 --> 01:58.036
Oh, maybe I can.

01:58.119 --> 02:00.288
I got an e-mail
from corporate

02:00.371 --> 02:02.415
that told me...
Okay.

02:02.791 --> 02:04.459
...that you got
a promotion!

02:05.877 --> 02:08.838
Right? I mean, that's not the kind of thing
you want to read quietly at your desk.

02:08.922 --> 02:11.257
If you make me head of sales
one more time, I swear.

02:11.341 --> 02:12.342
No. This is legit.

02:12.425 --> 02:16.137
You will be assembling a team to
go to Tallahassee for three weeks

02:16.221 --> 02:19.724
to develop and launch
a chain of Sabre stores.

02:20.517 --> 02:23.269
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

02:23.561 --> 02:25.563
Yes! Yes! Yes!

02:25.772 --> 02:29.567
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

02:29.901 --> 02:31.444
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

02:31.569 --> 02:32.821
The Schrutes
have a word for when

02:32.904 --> 02:35.990
everything in a man's life
comes together perfectly.

02:36.074 --> 02:37.992
"Perfektenschlag."

02:38.076 --> 02:39.828
Right now, I'm in it.

02:39.911 --> 02:42.121
I finally get a chance to
prove myself to corporate.

02:42.205 --> 02:45.416
I am assembling a competent team.
I am likely a father.

02:45.500 --> 02:50.380
I am so deep inside of
perfektenschlag right now.

02:50.463 --> 02:53.341
And just to be clear,
there is a second definition,

02:53.424 --> 02:55.844
"perfect pork anus,"
which I don't mean.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.221
And here's
the fax for you.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.515
And here's
some facts for you.

03:00.598 --> 03:03.101
Did you know frogs can
hear with their lungs?

03:03.935 --> 03:06.938
And that flamingos can have
orgasms that last 30 minutes.

03:07.897 --> 03:10.775
Love to learn. Yeah, it's weird
that I said that last one.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.610
So...

03:12.902 --> 03:14.863
Yeah, look at that.
We're pin twins.

03:14.946 --> 03:16.281
Pin twins.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.867
This is a gift from Jessica.
Kind of a gag gift, really.

03:18.950 --> 03:19.993
Real gifts come later.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.328
Yeah. That's cute.

03:22.412 --> 03:25.081
When I saw it at CVS,
it made me gag, too. Just...

03:31.504 --> 03:34.549
For a while there, I thought
something would change,but nope.

03:34.632 --> 03:35.884
Andy's still with Jessica.

03:35.967 --> 03:38.052
They even carpool
together most days.

03:38.511 --> 03:39.512
I don't know.

03:39.596 --> 03:42.557
I wouldn't mind carpooling
every day with Andy,

03:42.640 --> 03:45.268
but I wouldn't want to spend
that much time with Jessica.

03:46.728 --> 03:48.938
What do we have here?

03:53.651 --> 03:54.819
Val knit me a beanie.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.988
But I can't tell if it's a
"We're just friends" beanie,

03:57.071 --> 04:00.033
or a "I'm hot, you're hot,
let's get it popping" beanie.

04:00.116 --> 04:02.952
So I'm going
to up the ante.

04:03.036 --> 04:05.663
Give her a clearly
romantic gift.

04:05.747 --> 04:08.333
And we'll get to the
meaning of the beanie.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.085
Pam, pack up your
post-natal swimwear,

04:11.169 --> 04:12.795
make it a one piece or
this offer is rescinded,

04:12.879 --> 04:16.758
and join me for a fantastic barbeque one
week from today in Tallahassee, Florida,

04:16.841 --> 04:18.635
where I'm going to be living
for the next three weeks.

04:19.052 --> 04:20.595
Really?
Mm-hmm.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.430
I'll fly anywhere
for some good barbeque.

04:22.513 --> 04:23.514
Ooh, me three.

04:23.598 --> 04:27.518
No plus ones.
This is for competent workers only.

04:27.602 --> 04:30.146
And don't worry about the cost.
Sabre is footing the bill.

04:30.229 --> 04:32.607
Does this have anything to do with
what you were talking to Andy about?

04:32.690 --> 04:34.067
God, you're
such a spy.

04:37.612 --> 04:39.697
Notice anything
different about me?

04:39.781 --> 04:41.824
You're wearing the beanie.
You like it?

04:41.908 --> 04:44.661
Super comfortable. Like
sweatpants for my head.

04:44.744 --> 04:46.412
I love it too, Val.

04:46.496 --> 04:47.705
It's really itchy,

04:48.081 --> 04:51.376
uh, but to be fair, my head
is constantly itching,

04:51.459 --> 04:54.045
so I can't really
peg it on the hat.

04:55.171 --> 04:58.216
Wow. It's like the Nation
of Islam down here.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.802
I like to knit,
don't hate.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.388
Who's that for?

05:03.471 --> 05:08.142
Oh. This is a gift for
my man Nate here.

05:08.226 --> 05:09.435
What?
Yeah.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.853
Darryl, you
shouldn't have.

05:11.896 --> 05:14.482
Can I open it? No,no,no,
maybe just later.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.734
Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry.
I'm too excited.

05:21.447 --> 05:22.657
Darryl.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.534
Wow. Those
are really nice.

05:24.617 --> 05:26.285
They're so elegant.

05:26.411 --> 05:28.246
Cashmere.
How did you know?

05:28.496 --> 05:30.248
Just a hunch.

05:31.457 --> 05:32.750
Your gift is on the way.

05:32.834 --> 05:34.085
Can't wait.

05:35.420 --> 05:38.339
"I'm glad you're in my life.
Happy Valentine's Day."

05:38.423 --> 05:42.093
Darryl, I am glad
to be in your life, too.

05:43.261 --> 05:46.264
Your card is more
beautiful than the gloves.

05:48.933 --> 05:52.020
My first task as special
project manager Dwight Schrute,

05:52.103 --> 05:53.980
assembling a crack team.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.816
I need people who are loyal,

05:57.108 --> 06:00.945
people who will help me get an inroad
with the gay Hispanic community.

06:01.112 --> 06:03.197
People who won't be missed.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.325
We don't need idiots.

06:07.493 --> 06:09.037
Good for nothings.

06:09.704 --> 06:10.955
Meth heads.

06:12.290 --> 06:13.458
Or...

06:13.916 --> 06:14.959
What's your name?

06:15.126 --> 06:17.170
Cathy.
Cathy.

06:23.134 --> 06:24.844
I just got a text from
Robert California that says,

06:24.927 --> 06:26.471
"Bring your clubs
to Florida."

06:26.763 --> 06:28.806
Why? Does he think you're
going to Florida?

06:29.140 --> 06:31.517
I hope not. Because
I am not going.

06:32.602 --> 06:33.728
Two question marks?

06:33.811 --> 06:37.398
No, just do one. Two question
marks is kind of aggressive.

06:37.482 --> 06:39.275
You know, it's like,
"Well, what?"

06:39.567 --> 06:41.277
Just do one.

06:42.028 --> 06:44.989
You want to take Darryl,
Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?

06:45.073 --> 06:46.074
Yes.

06:46.157 --> 06:48.618
Can I interest you
in someone less essential?

06:48.701 --> 06:50.995
Like a Creed or a
Meredith, perhaps?

06:51.079 --> 06:53.164
Oh, my God. They're not
expendable exactly.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.750
I just can't... I can't think
of the word I'm trying to find.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.001
Are you kidding me?

06:57.085 --> 06:58.961
I'm supposed to get on an
airplane with those nincompoops?

06:59.045 --> 07:00.129
We'd never make it
off the runway!

07:00.213 --> 07:03.633
All right, look, I got to keep
this office functioning somehow,

07:03.716 --> 07:06.385
so I have put
together a list.

07:06.469 --> 07:07.929
Here's your team.

07:08.012 --> 07:09.555
Darryl and Phyllis,
you can have.

07:10.098 --> 07:12.016
You're also taking Cathy,
Kelly and Kevin.

07:12.350 --> 07:14.185
Oh, God.
You have your team.

07:14.435 --> 07:17.688
Kevin? Kelly? Cathy?

07:17.772 --> 07:20.149
Andy just gave me a chain
with three weak links.

07:20.233 --> 07:23.319
Have you ever tried to use a chain
with three weak links? I have.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.863
And now I no longer
own an Arctic Wolf.

07:27.949 --> 07:29.158
Well, let's hear it.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.953
"Robert, hey," exclamation point.
I like it so far.

07:32.036 --> 07:33.621
"Got your text.
Awesome idea.

07:33.704 --> 07:37.083
"Let's hit the links the next
time you're in PA. -J.H."

07:38.292 --> 07:42.046
It's perfect. You emphasize the
golf, completely omit the Florida.

07:42.213 --> 07:43.381
Yeah, it's a golf text.

07:43.673 --> 07:45.424
Total golf text. Send it.

07:46.175 --> 07:50.471
Done. Wait, I just feel weird.
I should just call him.

07:50.555 --> 07:54.642
You want to call someone that texted you?
Do you want to drive them away? I mean...

07:58.396 --> 07:59.605
This is Darryl.

07:59.689 --> 08:01.983
Sorry, I asked for
the main shipment number.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.609
I just need the address
for the warehouse.

08:03.693 --> 08:05.278
I want to send my
girlfriend some flowers.

08:06.195 --> 08:09.073
Your girlfriend?
ls your girlfriend Val?

08:09.157 --> 08:11.075
Yeah. Do you know her?

08:11.534 --> 08:15.163
We're friends.
We're friends.

08:16.164 --> 08:18.833
Cool. So can I get
that address or...

08:19.375 --> 08:22.170
Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I'm
just looking for a pen.

08:22.253 --> 08:23.296
Why do you
need a pen?

08:23.379 --> 08:25.214
Back off.
I got my reasons.

08:26.048 --> 08:27.175
May I have your
attention, please?

08:27.258 --> 08:29.010
Could Cathy, Phyllis,
Darryl, Kevin and Kelly

08:29.093 --> 08:31.095
please join me in the
conference room immediately?

08:31.304 --> 08:32.638
Why?
No big deal.

08:32.722 --> 08:35.933
It's just that you five have been
deemed most deserving of a three-week,

08:36.017 --> 08:38.436
all expenses paid business
trip to Tallahassee, Florida.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.563
Hell, yeah.
What?

08:40.646 --> 08:43.858
I'm sorry, Stanley. I can't share
any more details with you.

08:43.941 --> 08:46.027
You see,
Andy rejected you.

08:46.110 --> 08:48.112
Wait,
Cathy gets to go?

08:48.196 --> 08:50.406
Why does she even still work here?
Pam is back.

08:50.489 --> 08:51.866
It just feels like
a slap in the face.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.701
I can understand your pain.
And your rage.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.953
But you know what?
Andy is an honorable man.

08:56.037 --> 08:59.248
Let us not question his choices.
I'm sure he had his reasons.

08:59.332 --> 09:01.792
We're not questioning his reasons.
I just want to know what they are.

09:01.918 --> 09:03.127
I know. You and me
both, brother.

09:03.211 --> 09:04.378
It seemed kind
of random to me,

09:04.462 --> 09:08.341
but he was pretty clear on who he thought
truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.

09:08.424 --> 09:13.095
Well, he nailed it, because
I do deserve a vacation.

09:13.179 --> 09:15.556
Sometimes Batman's
got to take off his cape.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.851
Good point. But we're going to be
working pretty hard until 5:00 p.m.

09:18.935 --> 09:22.813
After that, it's going to be beach
volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral

09:22.897 --> 09:24.815
and sea kayaking
with Gloria Estefan.

09:25.024 --> 09:26.567
What were the
criteria for going?

09:26.651 --> 09:29.987
It might be innate goodness
versus innate badness.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.156
But there's an easy
way to find out.

09:33.991 --> 09:36.994
Oh, Andy, got a few
questions for you.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.664
<i>Moshi moshi</i>

09:40.456 --> 09:42.375
Uh, the Florida
picks got out,

09:42.458 --> 09:45.419
and people were just kind of curious
as to why they weren't picked,

09:45.503 --> 09:47.421
and maybe you
could just clarify.

09:47.505 --> 09:48.506
Uh...

09:49.924 --> 09:55.096
Well, the deliberations were confidential,
so I feel like we should respect that.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.056
Respect it? You're
trying to tell me

09:57.139 --> 09:59.350
Kevin Malone deserves more
than Stanley Hudson?

09:59.809 --> 10:01.602
Hey.
Okay, it's obvious

10:01.686 --> 10:04.939
that Andy picked the people that
are least important to the office.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.608
Important? Because you and
your enormous monster baby

10:07.692 --> 10:08.776
are so important
to the branch?

10:08.859 --> 10:10.695
My baby is
not a monster.

10:10.778 --> 10:13.155
Hey, be proud of your
enormous monster baby.

10:13.239 --> 10:14.949
I was once an enormous
monster baby.

10:15.032 --> 10:18.327
Guys! Guys! Guys!

10:18.577 --> 10:23.416
Come on, seriously, we cannot let this
trip cause this kind of rift, guys.

10:23.499 --> 10:24.792
Stop calling us "guys"!

10:24.959 --> 10:28.879
I use the word "guys" a lot
when I'm nervous, guys.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.173
- Guys, guys, guys. Guys.
- Stop it.

10:31.257 --> 10:33.134
Stop! Stop it! Andy.

10:34.010 --> 10:35.594
Dudes.

10:35.678 --> 10:39.974
The dudes who are going to Florida
were picked by Dwight and me.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.976
Okay, hey, I
specifically remember

10:42.059 --> 10:44.270
that there were a lot of other people
I thought should be considered.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.396
Uh...

10:45.479 --> 10:47.398
If anybody's going to
Florida, it should be me.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.651
Every shirt that I have that isn't
a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama.

10:50.735 --> 10:53.404
I'm the only person in this
office who watches Burn Notice.

10:53.571 --> 10:56.657
Okay. I did not realize that so
many of you wanted to go so badly,

10:56.741 --> 10:59.827
so if you feel like you have a
very good reason to go to Florida,

10:59.910 --> 11:01.412
I'm happy to hear you out.
Great idea.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.497
So why doesn't everyone just
take the next five to six hours,

11:03.581 --> 11:05.958
come up with a statement on why you
feel you deserve to go to Florida,

11:06.042 --> 11:07.043
and Andy and I
will listen to it.

11:07.168 --> 11:09.795
No, that is a ridiculous waste of time.
For you maybe.

11:10.171 --> 11:11.714
Five to six hours?
Three to four hours.

11:11.797 --> 11:14.008
No,no,no,no.No.
Just two to three hours.

11:14.091 --> 11:16.510
Come up with a statement
over the next hour.

11:16.594 --> 11:17.595
Thirty minutes.

11:18.179 --> 11:19.430
I'm out.

11:19.597 --> 11:20.973
Okay, read it
back to me.

11:21.057 --> 11:23.517
"Robert, great offer. Wish I could
hit the links with you in Florida,

11:23.601 --> 11:26.771
"but a father of a newborn really should be
helping out his wife any chance he gets."

11:27.188 --> 11:30.399
Good. Doesn't sound pushy.
You're just stating a fact.

11:30.483 --> 11:32.443
Absolutely.
Works for me.

11:32.985 --> 11:35.071
Okay. Sending.

11:35.154 --> 11:37.573
Well done. And we managed
to kill the entire morning.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.283
We really did.

11:45.331 --> 11:46.957
He responded, "L.O.L."

11:55.549 --> 11:58.552
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in.
I am already...

11:58.636 --> 12:02.348
I already picked my team, Darryl,
Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby.

12:02.515 --> 12:04.308
And that is the team
that I am taking.

12:04.725 --> 12:07.728
What's that? It's not up to me?
I only have influence?

12:07.812 --> 12:10.606
Well, that's all
Baltzer Glattfuelder had,

12:10.689 --> 12:13.359
and now no one eats
owls for Thanksgiving.

12:13.943 --> 12:16.028
You have two young, dynamic
people in this office

12:16.112 --> 12:17.822
who know trends,
who know youth.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.908
That's myself and Kelly Kapoor,
you need one of us there.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.829
Or both? Not both. Just one. Me.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.373
Or if not me, Kelly.
Ideally me.

12:27.456 --> 12:28.791
Again, youth knowledge,

12:28.874 --> 12:31.502
that's what you get when you put Ryan
Howard on your special project team.

12:32.002 --> 12:35.172
Or Kelly Kapoor.
Again, not both. Thanks.

12:36.507 --> 12:38.134
Very impressive.

12:38.259 --> 12:40.678
He put a lot of work into that.
Mm-hmm.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.763
PowerPoints are the peacocks
of the business world.

12:42.847 --> 12:44.390
All show, no meat.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.602
Because I feel like that I am in
a place with my gambling rehab

12:48.686 --> 12:52.022
that I can finally start
going to dog racing again.

12:52.648 --> 12:57.111
You know, just sitting,
watching, enjoying the sport.

12:57.194 --> 13:01.449
Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's
like a crazy mismatch or something.

13:01.532 --> 13:03.617
Okay. Thank you, Kevin,
we'll let you know.

13:03.701 --> 13:05.369
Thank you.
When do we leave?

13:05.661 --> 13:07.037
Thank you.

13:07.329 --> 13:10.374
It really has been
a long, lonely winter.

13:10.541 --> 13:14.420
Wow. Seasonal affective
disorder, a.k.a. SAD.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.881
That sounds like
a very real thing, Toby.

13:17.089 --> 13:19.717
It is real. Thank you
for saying that.

13:20.009 --> 13:22.595
Yeah, wow,
it's almost like

13:22.678 --> 13:26.640
we're not all experiencing
the same winter.

13:26.724 --> 13:30.394
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida
Stanley is happy to go to work.

13:30.478 --> 13:33.230
Florida Stanley is who you
want on your Florida team.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.943
It's still... Well.
...she does here.

13:38.027 --> 13:39.904
Hey, guys.
Any spots left?

13:40.279 --> 13:41.906
Erin, you want to go
to Tallahassee?

13:42.448 --> 13:43.991
I do. I really do.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.202
I think it would be a nice
way to clear my head.

13:47.495 --> 13:49.747
You know, I don't think it's a good
idea for you to clear your head

13:49.830 --> 13:51.665
any more than it
has been already.

13:51.749 --> 13:53.417
I think you need
a workplace where

13:53.501 --> 13:56.962
the burdens of everyday life
keep you tethered to reality.

13:57.421 --> 13:58.464
Either or.

13:58.547 --> 14:01.217
But if you can find someone to
fill in, I would love to go.

14:01.342 --> 14:03.427
Well, it wouldn't be hard
to find someone to fill in.

14:04.595 --> 14:07.806
Really? Oh, great. Good.

14:08.557 --> 14:11.101
Now, is it too dark to say that
Cece's having an operation?

14:11.685 --> 14:13.103
I think you need
to go to Florida.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.314
I think you're right.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.691
It's only for three weeks.

14:17.775 --> 14:19.860
You know, with my mom and sister
at the house, it'll be...

14:19.944 --> 14:20.986
A total nightmare.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.073
I was going to say good, because
I'll have all the help I need.

14:24.156 --> 14:25.741
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
They're incredibly helpful.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.076
You're lucky
to have them.

14:27.159 --> 14:28.744
With them there, you probably
won't even know I'm gone.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.079
Exactly.

14:32.790 --> 14:33.791
Well...

14:34.124 --> 14:39.129
No. No! Absolutely not. You are not going!
Over my dead body, no. Andy...

14:39.213 --> 14:41.423
Toons, I'm really sorry.

14:41.507 --> 14:43.717
You're too essential to the operation here.
I can't let you go.

14:43.801 --> 14:46.262
I wouldn't say that.
That's a bit much.

14:46.345 --> 14:47.680
You know, Dwight, if you
didn't want me to go,

14:47.763 --> 14:50.849
the smart move would be to tell Andy that
I actually am essential to the operation.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.101
That way, I couldn't go.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.396
Jim is essential... Hold on. I
just want to get it on camera.

14:57.314 --> 15:00.943
Andy, Jim is just too...

15:01.151 --> 15:02.152
Essential

15:02.778 --> 15:03.946
This is stupid! Cut!

15:04.154 --> 15:05.322
All right. I'm going
to pack my trunks.

15:05.406 --> 15:06.448
He doesn't even
want to go.

15:06.615 --> 15:07.950
Well, I got a text
from R.C.

15:08.033 --> 15:11.620
inviting me to come down, so I think
that's going to make us roommates.

15:12.830 --> 15:13.872
Oh, my God.

15:14.081 --> 15:17.084
Hey, quick question, do you shower at night?
Or do you shower in the morning?

15:17.167 --> 15:19.670
Because I want to shower when you're
showering to save some water.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.675
Okay, listen up, everyone.
Here's who's going to Florida.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.385
Cathy.
What?

15:26.468 --> 15:27.595
Stanley.
No.

15:27.678 --> 15:28.804
Ryan.
No!

15:28.887 --> 15:30.014
Erin.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.348
And Jim.

15:31.432 --> 15:33.684
You got to be
kidding me. Okay.

15:34.685 --> 15:36.020
Okay.

15:36.562 --> 15:38.856
Florida group,
welcome to the team.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.284
Let's go!

15:50.367 --> 15:53.621
Step it up, you runts.
You infants. Let's move.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.122
Why is it so
hot in here?

15:55.205 --> 15:59.251
Hot? What are you talking about? This
is a nice, temperate Florida morning.

15:59.335 --> 16:01.378
Eighty-five degrees,
73% humidity.

16:02.046 --> 16:04.006
This is the exact environment
that you will be facing

16:04.089 --> 16:06.133
for the next three
weeks of your life.

16:06.216 --> 16:09.637
Welcome to Special
Projects orientation.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.764
The next three weeks
of your life

16:11.847 --> 16:15.225
are going to be the most
miserable you've ever faced.

16:15.309 --> 16:18.020
They're going to be hard.
They're going to be dirty.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.397
You're going to
wish you were dead.

16:21.315 --> 16:22.316
But?

16:22.399 --> 16:24.109
"But?" There's no "buts."

16:24.193 --> 16:27.071
That's it. You'll wish you were dead.
You seem a little disturbed.

16:27.196 --> 16:28.864
Do you want to stay here?
No. No. I want to go.

16:28.947 --> 16:32.159
Because if any of you
would prefer to stay here,

16:32.242 --> 16:34.370
all you need to do
is ring this bell.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.246
Is that the buzzer
from Taboo?

16:36.914 --> 16:38.624
Shut up, maggot!
It is.

16:38.707 --> 16:40.376
You don't want to go,
ring the bell!

16:40.709 --> 16:42.419
Ring it. Ring it.

16:42.711 --> 16:45.756
How many of you have seen the
documentary Deliverance?

16:47.341 --> 16:48.967
How did a mosquito
get in here?

16:49.593 --> 16:51.845
I released 300 mosquitoes
into the conference room.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.180
Just temporarily.

16:53.263 --> 16:56.058
When I'm done, the frogs will
take care of the mosquitoes.

16:58.769 --> 17:02.481
Yes. And then he brushes
your soft supple cheeks

17:02.564 --> 17:05.818
with his worn leathery
hands and says,

17:05.901 --> 17:09.029
"I'm going to make you
the seventh Mrs. Rosenblat!"

17:09.363 --> 17:10.781
Unless you ring
the bell. Ring it.

17:10.864 --> 17:11.949
No.
Ring the bell.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.868
You want to spend the rest of your life
changing your husband's colostomy bags?

17:14.952 --> 17:17.287
Huh? Do you? Ring it!
What? Ah.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.290
What was that?
Mosquito.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.049
Orientation's over.

17:30.718 --> 17:32.469
Darryl, hey.

17:32.553 --> 17:33.637
Hey, what's up?
You called?

17:33.887 --> 17:35.931
Yeah, you know,
I felt really terrible

17:36.014 --> 17:38.475
that you got me these lovely gloves,
and I didn't get you anything.

17:38.559 --> 17:39.601
It's cool, really.

17:39.685 --> 17:41.520
No, it's anything
but cool

17:41.603 --> 17:46.734
Now, I haven't really had time to
go out and buy you anything, but

17:46.817 --> 17:48.235
here goes.

17:48.318 --> 17:51.947
"This coupon entitles you to one
free tickle monster attack."

17:52.030 --> 17:55.534
Yeah. They're Nate coupons or Nate-pons.
And they're all different.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.370
Cash that one in and I will
bring you a stick of gum

17:58.871 --> 18:01.915
any time, any place.
I'll find you.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.293
Thanks.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.254
Nice flowers.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.881
Thanks.They're
from my mom.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.759
Your mom?

18:12.760 --> 18:14.094
Yeah.

18:14.178 --> 18:15.387
Oh.

18:15.471 --> 18:19.224
So I guess that was your mom who called
me earlier looking for the address.

18:19.308 --> 18:20.517
Real deep-voiced woman.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.186
Yeah, that's her.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.189
She said her name
was Brandon, I think.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.815
Your mom's name
is Brandon?

18:28.734 --> 18:31.987
Yeah, Darryl. My mom's
name is Brandon.

18:35.866 --> 18:38.911
I guess I figured
out where I stand.

18:38.994 --> 18:42.039
This is a love beanie.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.295
Okay, Florida team,
let's reconvene.

18:59.097 --> 19:02.392
I'm going to Florida.
And I'm not coming back.

19:05.354 --> 19:08.816
So Sabre has set up a conference room
for our use while we're at corporate.

19:08.899 --> 19:10.734
So what is this
special project?

19:10.901 --> 19:12.528
Basically, Sabre has
tasked us with

19:12.611 --> 19:14.530
helping them branch into
the retail market place.

19:14.613 --> 19:16.406
They want to set up their own
version of an Apple store.

19:16.698 --> 19:17.741
That sounds awesome.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.701
It did. It did.

19:19.785 --> 19:20.828
You know what
might be great?

19:20.911 --> 19:23.705
Is if instead of a genius
bar, we have a lounge area

19:23.789 --> 19:25.999
where people can ask
questions about the product

19:26.083 --> 19:27.584
with other customers
who liked it.

19:28.418 --> 19:31.588
Yeah, and they should have a place where
people can check their computers or printers

19:31.672 --> 19:34.132
before they see you, so you don't
have to carry it around like a dope.

19:34.675 --> 19:35.759
Like a coat check.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.683
Oh, don't write it down
unless you like it.

19:42.766 --> 19:43.767
Oh, I like it.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.854
It seems to me that the Apple
store is kind of like a party,

19:46.937 --> 19:49.773
so I think our question is, how
do we make this a better party?

19:49.857 --> 19:53.527
No. We sell business tools and
the stores need to reflect that.

19:53.610 --> 19:56.947
They need to be all business. Let all
the other stores look like a toy store.

19:57.072 --> 20:00.367
Right. Think different.
From Apple.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.289
Dwight, is now a good time to
go over what you expect of us?

20:12.921 --> 20:14.423
Yes.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.341
What are my expectations
for the group?

20:16.466 --> 20:19.887
I have been given the responsibility
to manage Stanley, a solid player.

20:19.970 --> 20:22.097
Ryan, who is capable
of surprises.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.016
Erin, an excellent
follower.

20:24.433 --> 20:27.477
And Cathy, a probably not
totally useless enigma.

20:27.603 --> 20:29.980
And, well, Jim.

20:30.898 --> 20:34.318
Under the right manager,
that's not a bad team.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.154
Perfektenschlag.

20:44.036 --> 20:45.495
I don't know how I'm going
to live here without you.

20:45.787 --> 20:48.248
Me neither. Hey, will you
put this coat on my chair?

20:48.332 --> 20:49.666
I just realized I'm not going
to need it down there.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.376
Yes, I will take
your coat.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.794
And I will keep it
with me,

20:52.878 --> 20:54.588
and I will sleep with it
because it smells like you.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.006
No,no,no,no,no.
Just put it on my chair.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.217
All right.
Bye.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.720
Bye. Call me when you land.
I will.

21:02.721 --> 21:04.014
Safe travels!

21:04.389 --> 21:07.184
Goodbye for a very,
very long time.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.353
Okay.

21:09.811 --> 21:11.188
It's only three weeks.

21:15.776 --> 21:17.194
All expenses paid.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.738
Yeah. Jim's going
to be there.

21:19.821 --> 21:23.200
That marriage is not good.
Nobody knows better than me.

21:24.493 --> 21:26.036
Definitely, we will.

21:26.119 --> 21:29.331
It's three weeks in Tallahassee.
What else is there to do?
