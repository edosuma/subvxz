<i>Previously on "one tree hill"... we could
really use a good young coach like you.</i>

00:04.313 --> 00:05.573
I thought you wanted me
to play.

00:05.607 --> 00:07.038
Well, nathan,
your playing days are over.

00:07.102 --> 00:08.566
Come on.
You must know that.

00:08.631 --> 00:11.431
The magazine, the line -
You can have everything.

00:11.496 --> 00:13.691
Do you know they didn't even
want to do a book tour?

00:13.725 --> 00:15.887
What could possibly be more
important than chicago?

00:15.952 --> 00:17.998
My wedding.

00:18.064 --> 00:19.639
It's peyton.

00:19.707 --> 00:22.323
It's mick.
He's my father.

00:22.392 --> 00:24.404
He's coming over for dinner.

00:24.470 --> 00:26.227
Shut up and pour, okay?

00:31.412 --> 00:32.685
I'm not dead.

00:32.753 --> 00:33.585
Sure, you are.

00:48.656 --> 00:51.190
Why do guys insist
on packing their bags

00:51.257 --> 00:53.024
At the last
possible minute?

00:53.091 --> 00:56.224
We do it to torture you.
????

00:56.291 --> 00:58.324
Big day, huh?

00:58.392 --> 00:59.691
Yeah.

00:59.758 --> 01:01.958
Anyhow, the first signing's
always the most stressful.

01:02.025 --> 01:03.058
Yeah.

01:03.126 --> 01:04.293
But i get to see
mouth today.

01:04.358 --> 01:06.460
That'll be fun.

01:06.526 --> 01:08.892
I still don't understand why
they're sending you to omaha

01:08.960 --> 01:10.561
To launch the book tour.

01:10.626 --> 01:13.060
Well, they like to generate
a little buzz

01:13.127 --> 01:15.194
Before the bigger markets,
you know?

01:15.261 --> 01:17.261
Worked for the last book.

01:17.328 --> 01:19.161
I wish i could go
with you.

01:19.228 --> 01:21.061
It's not too late.

01:21.129 --> 01:22.895
Oh, yeah. 'Cause that wouldn't
be awkward -

01:22.962 --> 01:26.029
You, your fiancéE,
your ex-FiancéE.

01:26.096 --> 01:27.628
Peyton.
I'm sorry.

01:27.696 --> 01:30.930
I know lindsey is your editor.
I just -

01:30.996 --> 01:33.763
I'm jealous that she gets you
for the next week,

01:33.831 --> 01:35.597
And i get mick.

01:35.664 --> 01:36.797
Great.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.797
Why do you think
he's avoiding

01:38.864 --> 01:40.730
Admitting that
he's your father?

01:42.842 --> 01:43.998
I don't know.

01:44.065 --> 01:46.432
Maybe i'm wrong.
Maybe he's not.

01:46.500 --> 01:50.233
Either way, i will be all right.
Don't worry about me.

01:50.300 --> 01:53.033
You know i will.

01:53.101 --> 01:54.900
I'll call you when i land. Yeah.

01:54.967 --> 01:57.600
I love you.

01:59.435 --> 02:01.968
Don't forget me when you're
a big star, lucas scott.

02:02.035 --> 02:03.035
Mm-Hmm.

02:04.836 --> 02:10.036
* so many years apart
i've missed *

02:10.104 --> 02:12.304
You know, hales, with everything
you've been through lately,

02:12.370 --> 02:13.937
I'm sure principal turner
would understand

02:14.003 --> 02:15.471
If you needed a little
more time off.

02:15.538 --> 02:17.971
I think two weeks
of replaying that day

02:18.038 --> 02:19.405
In my head is enough.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.838
It's time for me to get back
to my life.

02:21.905 --> 02:24.839
Besides, it will be nice
to have the distraction.

02:24.905 --> 02:26.939
If you need me,
you know i'm here.

02:27.005 --> 02:28.772
Yeah.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.873
You know what?
Let's cut through shop.

02:31.677 --> 02:33.252
You can cut through shop?

02:33.288 --> 02:34.882
You were such a nerd
in high school.

02:34.917 --> 02:36.374
I was an honor student!

02:36.441 --> 02:38.674
Exactly.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.841
Nerd.

02:40.908 --> 02:42.842
"Nerd."

02:42.908 --> 02:45.039
You don't know what you'd do
without me.

02:45.976 --> 02:46.915
Nathan!

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:04.012 --> 03:05.846
So, you want to tell me
why you were sleeping

03:05.912 --> 03:07.413
In the backseat of a car
at school?

03:07.480 --> 03:08.712
Well, it was either there

03:08.779 --> 03:10.413
Or that smelly couch
in the teacher's lounge.

03:10.481 --> 03:11.880
I can't believe you sit
on that thing.

03:11.947 --> 03:13.947
For the record,
i don't go near that thing.

03:14.013 --> 03:15.247
So, tell me
where you live

03:15.314 --> 03:17.419
Because i'm pretty sure
it's not in shop class.

03:18.881 --> 03:20.814
I live in a foster home.

03:23.149 --> 03:24.915
Okay.

03:24.982 --> 03:26.249
Well,
give me your number.

03:26.316 --> 03:28.483
I'm gonna need to speak
with your foster parents.

03:28.550 --> 03:32.484
Hell no. Please.
That'll just make it worse.

03:32.550 --> 03:35.250
This is none
of your business, okay?

03:35.318 --> 03:37.384
Sam, if there's a problem
at home, tell me.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.684
I can get you some help.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.151
There's not a problem.

03:40.219 --> 03:41.985
This is one of the better
fosteromes i've been in.

03:42.052 --> 03:43.618
The others were...

03:43.685 --> 03:46.751
Not so good.

03:46.819 --> 03:49.320
So it's just a little crowded.
It's okay.

03:49.386 --> 03:50.487
It's not okay, sam.

03:50.553 --> 03:52.320
Is there anybody
that was worried

03:52.387 --> 03:54.287
That you didn't come home
last night?

03:54.354 --> 03:56.753
You don't get it.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.653
Nobody cares.

03:58.721 --> 04:00.032
It's kind of like
being invisible.

04:00.067 --> 04:02.688
Cash their checks, i don't get
slapped around. That's the deal.

04:02.754 --> 04:04.621
And it's a pretty
good deal.

04:04.689 --> 04:06.123
So don't screw this up
for me.

04:06.189 --> 04:08.991
Sam, i can't just pretend
like this didn't happen.

04:09.026 --> 04:10.456
You're 15 years old.

04:10.492 --> 04:12.057
There has to be something
better for you.

04:12.124 --> 04:15.023
You seem nice,
but i'm not your girl.

04:15.090 --> 04:18.623
I'm not anybody's girl.
It happens.

04:18.690 --> 04:19.757
Sam!

04:23.540 --> 04:25.940
Millie: look who it is -
The world's best boss.

04:26.007 --> 04:28.274
And what are you
buttering me up for?

04:28.341 --> 04:30.441
Nothing.
We just have lots to do.

04:30.508 --> 04:33.275
Millie,
i love you dearly,

04:33.341 --> 04:36.479
But you realize we are
standing in a clothing store

04:36.515 --> 04:39.643
<i>That has no clothes
in it,</i>

04:39.710 --> 04:41.843
And i am fresh out
of ideas.

04:41.909 --> 04:44.143
<i>Are you sure about that?</i>

04:45.559 --> 04:47.076
What is that?

04:47.144 --> 04:49.077
I wrote down a list
of ideas.

04:49.144 --> 04:51.498
And then you covered them
with a sheet?

04:51.533 --> 04:52.838
Yeah, that was more
for effect.

04:52.874 --> 04:54.911
I've always wanted to pull
a sheet off something

04:54.978 --> 04:56.078
And say "voil?"

04:56.145 --> 04:58.045
All right, well,
now's your big chance.

04:59.812 --> 05:01.621
"Go skydiving"?

05:01.656 --> 05:03.380
You didn't let me
say "voil?"

05:03.446 --> 05:05.912
I'm sorry.
But, look.

05:05.980 --> 05:08.414
Skydiving sounds
really fun and all,

05:08.481 --> 05:12.014
But how is it gonna help
this company?

05:12.081 --> 05:14.464
Well, maybe before
you can heal the company,

05:14.499 --> 05:16.848
You have to heal your soul
a little first.

05:18.628 --> 05:20.483
"Ride a motorcycle.

05:20.549 --> 05:23.516
"Learn to speak french.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.916
"Get drunk at oktoberfest.

05:25.983 --> 05:28.783
Watch every
james bond movie."

05:31.118 --> 05:34.618
Millie, why do these
all sound so familiar?

05:34.686 --> 05:36.085
Because they're all
your ideas.

05:36.152 --> 05:38.219
You're always talking
about stuff you wanted to try,

05:38.286 --> 05:39.952
And victoria either said
they were stupid

05:40.020 --> 05:41.320
Or you were too busy.

05:41.387 --> 05:42.919
So while she was
telling me

05:42.986 --> 05:44.953
I couldn't do any
of these things...

05:45.020 --> 05:47.886
I was writing them down
so someday you could.

05:47.954 --> 05:50.688
Welcome to someday,
brooke davis.

05:50.755 --> 05:53.695
* maybe they had it made
somehow *

05:53.731 --> 05:56.176
* living for there and then *

05:56.211 --> 05:58.622
* under a psychedelic spell *

05:58.690 --> 06:00.123
Thank you.

06:00.189 --> 06:01.822
So, you gonna show
me something?

06:01.889 --> 06:05.139
* still they had so much
to tell *

06:05.175 --> 06:08.391
* whatever happens
to the dreamers *

06:09.636 --> 06:10.790
Hey, man.
What the hell was that?

06:10.858 --> 06:12.292
That was game.

06:12.358 --> 06:13.425
We not working
on your jumper,

06:13.492 --> 06:14.525
So why would you pull up
like that?

06:14.592 --> 06:15.601
You cut off the lane.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.358
So, don't let me cut
the lane off, then.

06:17.426 --> 06:19.259
What if your jumper
not falling that day?

06:19.326 --> 06:21.126
So, what? You too scared
to get physical?

06:21.192 --> 06:23.403
You want physical?
Yeah.

06:24.527 --> 06:26.993
* it's only when they close
their eyes *

06:27.060 --> 06:29.761
Hoo-Hoo. That's what i'm talking
about, baby.

06:29.827 --> 06:31.028
Whoo!

06:31.094 --> 06:32.961
You're doing great, honey.

06:33.028 --> 06:34.495
Thanks.Thanks.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.296
Just check the ball.

06:51.997 --> 06:54.964
* i love you, i do *

06:59.333 --> 07:02.999
* nothing's ever been
this way before *

07:04.817 --> 07:09.000
* a dream is just a dream
and nothing more *

07:10.959 --> 07:14.868
* nothing's ever been
this way before *

07:16.835 --> 07:20.336
* a dream is just a dream
and nothing more *

07:43.873 --> 07:46.840
<i>Were you ever sober
for an entire year?</i>

07:46.908 --> 07:50.308
What part of "rock guitarist"
don't you get?

07:50.375 --> 07:52.108
That's what i thought.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.576
If you don't mind,
i'll have that back.

07:57.643 --> 08:00.576
Why? So you can keep lying
to yourself?

08:00.644 --> 08:02.994
You wouldn't understand.

08:03.029 --> 08:05.510
You're right. You're right.
I don't understand.

08:05.578 --> 08:07.278
I don't understand
any of this.

08:07.345 --> 08:10.812
Honestly, i wish
you hadn't have come here.

08:12.719 --> 08:15.012
I would have sucked
at being your father!

08:17.158 --> 08:19.613
???At's why ellie and i
gave you up.

08:21.913 --> 08:25.547
There, i said it.
Are you happy now?

08:25.614 --> 08:28.815
After 22 years,

08:28.881 --> 08:31.349
<i>That is the best
you can give me -</i>

08:31.415 --> 08:34.448
"There, i said it"?

08:36.450 --> 08:38.383
That's all i got.

08:50.318 --> 08:53.752
Thanks, dad.
You can go now.

09:00.620 --> 09:03.787
This is why i like
being on the road.

09:11.289 --> 09:14.022
Hey, grandpa.
Where's nanny deb?

09:14.089 --> 09:15.589
<i>I'm here
to pick you up today.</i>

09:15.656 --> 09:17.356
Really? Cool.

09:17.423 --> 09:19.480
So, wh do you
want to do?

09:19.515 --> 09:19.945
Well, that depends.

09:19.980 --> 09:22.923
What do you and nanny deb
usually do after school?

09:22.990 --> 09:24.757
Um, eat lots
of ice cream.

09:24.792 --> 09:26.524
That doesn't sound
like deb.

09:26.591 --> 09:28.825
Are you sure she lets you eat
ice cream after school?

09:28.891 --> 09:29.447
No.

09:29.482 --> 09:32.258
She makes me eat
veggies instead,

09:32.325 --> 09:34.759
Because they'll help me
grow big and strong.

09:34.827 --> 09:37.393
You want to know
a little secret?

09:37.460 --> 09:39.693
Most adults will tell you
almost anything

09:39.760 --> 09:42.727
To get you to eat your veggies,
and most of it's not true.

09:42.794 --> 09:45.927
Well, carrots really do
give you x-Ray vision, right?

09:45.993 --> 09:47.394
No.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.795
What?

09:49.861 --> 09:52.161
* so let me in *

09:52.228 --> 09:54.795
So, grandpa, do i really
get to make a wish

09:54.862 --> 09:56.389
For every brussels sprout
i eat?

09:56.424 --> 09:59.396
No, actually, they taste bad
for no reason at all.

09:59.464 --> 10:00.862
Come on.

10:01.996 --> 10:03.093
Hey, slow down
there, buddy.

10:03.128 --> 10:05.597
You're gonna give yourself
a brain freeze.

10:07.598 --> 10:09.698
Mmm. Is that good?

10:09.765 --> 10:12.064
Well, well.
What have we here?

10:12.132 --> 10:16.132
<i>Oh. Guess what?
They kiss a lot.</i>

10:16.199 --> 10:19.299
* well, they said
you was long gone *

10:19.367 --> 10:20.667
You want some more?

10:20.734 --> 10:22.133
Hey, little buddy.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.066
Hi, uncle skills.
Hi, nanny deb.

10:25.134 --> 10:27.581
Ice cream after school.

10:27.616 --> 10:29.568
<i>And i thought
i was a bad nanny.</i>

10:29.635 --> 10:30.973
Yeah. Well, you know,

10:31.008 --> 10:33.268
They ran out of all
those x-Ray vision carrots.

10:33.335 --> 10:35.469
*... and said all right *

10:35.536 --> 10:38.002
So, granny deb,
can i talk to you?

10:39.936 --> 10:47.204
* babydoll, the men who hang
like flowers in your hall *

10:49.238 --> 10:53.071
* are asking when
your love... *

10:53.139 --> 10:55.172
Is skills
out of high school yet?

10:55.239 --> 10:56.840
Uh, yeah, dan.

10:56.905 --> 10:59.473
He graduated the day you turned
yourself in for murder.

10:59.540 --> 11:02.340
And if you've come here
to criticize me -

11:02.407 --> 11:04.873
I haven't.

11:04.940 --> 11:07.207
I wanted to thank you
for telling the parole board

11:07.274 --> 11:08.874
The truth about carrie.

11:08.941 --> 11:10.842
You did the right thing.

11:10.907 --> 11:11.941
Did i?

11:13.609 --> 11:14.875
Are we done here?

11:14.942 --> 11:16.509
Yeah, that's all
i wanted to say.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.875
Good.
Have a nice life, dan.

11:18.943 --> 11:20.176
What's left of it.

11:21.510 --> 11:24.590
* 'cause i can stay
or, honey... *

11:24.626 --> 11:28.111
Let's go, antwon.
See you at home, sweetie.

11:28.177 --> 11:32.611
* just to wherever
you tell me so *

11:32.679 --> 11:35.746
* and find my place there *

11:35.813 --> 11:39.113
<i>Oh, it hurts.
It really hurts.</i>

11:41.814 --> 11:43.781
Yeah,
i know how you feel.

11:43.848 --> 11:45.347
Oh, my head.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.714
Hey.

11:47.782 --> 11:49.648
Did you eat all
the orange chicken?

11:49.715 --> 11:51.392
Sorry.

11:51.427 --> 11:53.068
Mouth usually gets9a
the mongolian beef

11:53.103 --> 11:55.548
And i eat all
the orange chicken.

11:55.616 --> 11:57.915
<i>Lucky for you
i like mongolian beef.</i>

11:59.851 --> 12:02.350
How you doing...

12:02.417 --> 12:03.950
Being away from him?

12:04.016 --> 12:06.350
To be honest,
i wish he'd just come home.

12:06.418 --> 12:09.084
If you ever decide you want
to leave, you just o.

12:09.151 --> 12:11.051
No questions asked.

12:11.118 --> 12:14.917
Thanks, brooke, but you've
always been there for me.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.586
I think it's my turn
to be here for you.

12:17.653 --> 12:20.886
* babydoll *

12:26.698 --> 12:27.954
Lucas scott.

12:28.020 --> 12:29.488
Lon. I'm with
putnam and pratt.

12:29.555 --> 12:31.722
It's nice to meet you.

12:32.825 --> 12:34.355
So, is lindsey gonna mt us
at the bookstore?

12:34.422 --> 12:35.955
No, lindsey's in new york.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.456
I'm gonna be taking her place
on the tour.

12:38.523 --> 12:40.823
<i>Oh.</i>

12:40.889 --> 12:43.323
Well, i guess it's just
you and me, then. Yep.

12:43.391 --> 12:44.890
So, uh, what'd you think
about the book?

12:44.957 --> 12:46.576
To be honest, i haven't had
a chance to read it yet,

12:46.611 --> 12:48.758
But, hey, it's at the top
of my to-Do list.

12:48.825 --> 12:51.492
"Comet," right?
I love science-Fiction.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.562
Taking a trip
down memory lane?

13:18.630 --> 13:21.830
I was just
dropping off jamie.

13:21.896 --> 13:23.430
I know.

13:24.831 --> 13:26.930
I heard about quentin fields.
I'm sorry.

13:26.997 --> 13:28.646
He was a good
basketball player.

13:28.681 --> 13:29.646
Yeah.

13:30.022 --> 13:34.709
???

13:35.347 --> 13:38.165
Makes you wonder how somebody
could do something like that.

13:41.366 --> 13:43.600
It was good
to see you, son.

13:46.501 --> 13:50.933
You saved my wife.
You saved my son.

13:51.001 --> 13:55.494
But you killed my uncle,
right here where i'm standing.

13:57.276 --> 13:59.603
I don't know
where that leaves us.

14:03.871 --> 14:06.170
At least my son
loves you.

14:08.204 --> 14:10.937
And my son hates me.

14:11.004 --> 14:13.004
Both of them.

14:45.043 --> 14:47.210
I thought i said
you could go.

14:47.276 --> 14:50.510
Yeah, well,
i... thought we should talk.

14:50.578 --> 14:52.375
Okay.

14:52.410 --> 14:53.803
I want to know why
you came here

14:53.839 --> 14:55.198
Pretending not to be
my real dad.

14:56.599 --> 14:57.533
What's a real dad?

14:57.599 --> 14:58.833
I mean, you got a dad,

14:58.900 --> 15:00.536
And obviously he did a good job
with you.

15:00.572 --> 15:02.053
So why do you have to keep
pushg it?

15:02.088 --> 15:03.862
Because it matters!

15:03.897 --> 15:06.064
So all this is just because
i couldn't tell you the truth?

15:06.131 --> 15:07.598
No! No.

15:07.665 --> 15:10.964
All of this because
you have missed my whole life,

15:11.031 --> 15:13.864
And it really doesn't seem
to bother you.

15:16.055 --> 15:17.199
You know,
i think you're right.

15:17.266 --> 15:20.700
It's probably a good time for me
to just move on.

15:22.667 --> 15:26.352
Great. I'm glad we can agree
on something.

15:40.737 --> 15:43.355
* good arms versus bad arms... *

15:44.137 --> 15:46.544
You know, this turnout
isn't exactly inspiring me

15:46.579 --> 15:48.178
To read your book, lucas.

15:48.245 --> 15:49.545
Whose brilliant idea
was it

15:49.612 --> 15:51.812
To put this signing in
the science-Fiction section?

15:51.879 --> 15:53.278
It's a book
about space, right?

15:53.345 --> 15:57.312
No, actually,
um, the comet's a metaphor.

15:57.379 --> 15:58.546
It's a love story.

16:01.115 --> 16:02.814
Well, you know what?

16:02.881 --> 16:04.681
We could have had this thing
out in the middle of main street,

16:04.748 --> 16:06.347
We wouldn't have gotten
any more traffic.

16:06.415 --> 16:07.415
Thanks for the support.

16:07.482 --> 16:09.248
Yeah.

16:09.315 --> 16:11.015
Will you sign my book?

16:11.082 --> 16:13.015
Yeah, of course i will.
What's your name?

16:13.083 --> 16:14.683
Hadley.
Hadley.

16:14.750 --> 16:15.514
That's a really
pretty name.

16:15.549 --> 16:17.883
You know,
my best friend's name is haley.

16:17.950 --> 16:20.016
But, uh,
i like "hadley" better.

16:20.084 --> 16:22.250
Thanks.

16:25.284 --> 16:28.618
Uh, actually,
this is a "gossip girl" book.

16:28.685 --> 16:30.752
<i>I know - My favorite.</i>

16:30.819 --> 16:33.786
*... rest at arm's length *

16:33.853 --> 16:36.619
* when they reach out,
don't touch them *

16:36.687 --> 16:39.987
Here you go.
Thanks.

16:42.222 --> 16:44.821
Mouth. Oh, my god.
It's good to see you, man.

16:44.888 --> 16:47.688
Lucas scott -
Big-Time writer.

16:47.755 --> 16:49.955
Am i the, uh,
last one to arrive?

16:50.022 --> 16:52.022
A- Actually,
you're the first.

16:52.089 --> 16:54.156
Oh?
Yeah.

16:54.224 --> 16:55.289
Oh.

16:57.690 --> 16:59.523
* i decided this decision
some... *

16:59.590 --> 17:02.556
When did brooke davis become
all work and no play?

17:02.624 --> 17:04.090
I am actually playing
right now.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.656
I'm gonna take
skydiving lessons.

17:05.723 --> 17:06.891
You want to come
with me?

17:06.959 --> 17:10.025
Ah, thanks,
but, no. No, thank you.

17:10.092 --> 17:13.025
Come on. I'm looking up
the safest places to go.

17:13.093 --> 17:15.127
Okay, well, i'm pretty sure
they're all equally unsafe.

17:15.193 --> 17:17.893
Listen.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.593
Would you be interested
in fostering a child?

17:22.497 --> 17:25.228
Well, i guess it would depend
on the situation.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.895
Do you remember sam?

17:26.962 --> 17:30.862
She's, um - She's the one
that stole from your store.

17:30.929 --> 17:34.395
<i>It figures she'd get pregnant.
She's so young!</i>

17:34.462 --> 17:35.963
No, she's not pregnant.
It's her.

17:36.029 --> 17:37.596
She's the one
that needs fostering.

17:37.663 --> 17:38.964
<i>But she's so old.</i>

17:39.030 --> 17:40.897
Well, she's 15.

17:40.964 --> 17:42.097
Look, i found her sleeping

17:42.164 --> 17:43.964
In the backseat of a car
in shop class,

17:44.031 --> 17:45.464
And her current
foster parents

17:45.531 --> 17:47.098
Didn't even know
that she was gone.

17:47.165 --> 17:49.297
Well, maybe they can
foster her in jail,

17:49.365 --> 17:51.099
'Cause it's where
she's headed.

17:51.166 --> 17:53.365
I think she's just acting out
for attention.

17:53.432 --> 17:55.365
It kind of reminds me
of somebody else

17:55.433 --> 17:57.504
I used to know
in high school.

17:59.134 --> 18:02.600
Haley, i'm sorry, but...

18:02.667 --> 18:06.501
I can't take in a teenager
right now.

18:06.568 --> 18:09.735
Find me a cute little baby
in shop class,

18:09.802 --> 18:11.169
We can talk about it.

18:11.236 --> 18:14.769
That's okay.
I- I totally understand.

18:14.836 --> 18:17.269
It's just...

18:17.336 --> 18:20.803
I think of jamie and how i would
do anything to protect him.

18:20.871 --> 18:22.871
And then i look at sam,

18:22.937 --> 18:27.537
And i wonder...
who's protecting her.

18:36.039 --> 18:40.140
Well, this is officially
embarrassing.

18:40.207 --> 18:42.874
Luke, it's not that bad.

18:42.941 --> 18:45.041
I've signed exactly
two books today,

18:45.108 --> 18:47.407
One of which
was a "gossip girl" book.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.208
I hear those
are pretty good.

18:49.275 --> 18:50.909
That's not helping, mouth.

18:50.976 --> 18:52.876
I'm sorry.

18:52.942 --> 18:54.575
Look,
maybe it's just omaha.

18:54.643 --> 18:58.077
I doubt it. My first book
sold really well here.

18:58.144 --> 19:00.309
This can't be good.

19:00.376 --> 19:02.376
Well, then,
look on the bright side.

19:02.444 --> 19:04.344
You get to hang out
with an old friend.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.944
Can i get a picture?

19:08.012 --> 19:09.779
Yeah, sure.

19:09.845 --> 19:13.079
All right, sweet.
Okay.

19:13.147 --> 19:15.312
Right there. Thanks.

19:15.379 --> 19:17.379
Sorry, luke.

19:19.580 --> 19:20.714
Say it.

19:20.781 --> 19:22.313
Actually,
i'd rather not.

19:22.380 --> 19:23.148
Come on.
Just say it.

19:25.115 --> 19:26.882
This is marvin mcfadden
on sports,

19:26.948 --> 19:28.548
And you've just heard
a mouthful.

19:28.615 --> 19:30.348
Nice!

19:30.414 --> 19:32.515
Thank you.
Yeah.

19:32.582 --> 19:33.582
Thank you.

19:46.252 --> 19:49.051
So, how'd it go
with brooke?

19:50.272 --> 19:51.253
She's just not ready
to take in

19:51.318 --> 19:53.452
A rebellious teenager
right now.

19:53.519 --> 19:57.819
Well...
she could stay with us.

19:57.887 --> 19:59.220
No.
I thought about that,

19:59.286 --> 20:01.053
But jamie's been through
so much.

20:01.121 --> 20:02.788
It's just not a good time
for him.

20:02.854 --> 20:05.888
Yeah. So have you.

20:12.655 --> 20:14.355
Hello.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.422
Nate - Mike wilson.

20:16.489 --> 20:17.757
Listen. I heard
you were looking

20:17.792 --> 20:19.689
For the opportunity
to play ball again.

20:19.757 --> 20:20.555
Yes, sir?

20:20.590 --> 20:22.624
Well, i have one for you.

20:22.690 --> 20:25.044
But it might not be exactly
what you're thinking.

20:29.992 --> 20:32.159
* come on *

20:32.226 --> 20:33.093
* wow *

20:36.959 --> 20:39.659
* wow *

20:43.095 --> 20:46.195
Wow.

20:49.095 --> 20:50.642
???

20:51.163 --> 20:53.629
<i>Man, that can't be good
for nobody's back.</i>

20:53.695 --> 20:55.729
This is the coolest thing
i've ever seen.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.097
You have to do this, daddy.

20:58.721 --> 20:59.596
Yeah.

21:14.933 --> 21:17.800
Brooke.
What is all this?

21:24.034 --> 21:27.134
I have to tell you
something.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.668
Okay.

21:29.735 --> 21:33.002
I'm sorry,
but i lied to you.

21:35.236 --> 21:40.118
I didn't fall
down the stairs, peyton.

21:53.418 --> 21:55.251
So, what are you
thinking, man?

21:55.319 --> 21:57.518
For real?
Yeah.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.252
Well, i was wondering

22:00.319 --> 22:02.985
If your mom would ever get back
with your dad.

22:03.053 --> 22:04.686
Man, i'm not talking about this
with you.

22:04.721 --> 22:06.320
Well, you asked me
what i was thinking about.

22:06.387 --> 22:07.286
That's what i was
thinking about.

22:07.354 --> 22:08.520
That's not what i meant.

22:08.587 --> 22:10.054
And will you stop
trying to act

22:10.121 --> 22:12.221
Like this situation with my mom
is for real?

22:12.287 --> 22:13.687
What's that
supposed toúMean?

22:13.755 --> 22:15.122
You know exactly
what it means.

22:15.188 --> 22:16.855
The only people
signing off on this

22:16.921 --> 22:19.222
Are you, her,
and jamie, okay?

22:23.256 --> 22:26.223
Look at that boy.

22:26.290 --> 22:29.523
He's just jumping around,
having fun.

22:29.590 --> 22:32.623
I mean, after everything
he been through lately,

22:32.691 --> 22:35.392
He just keep going.

22:35.458 --> 22:37.158
Won't let nothing
beat him down.

22:37.225 --> 22:38.891
That's a strong kid
right there.

22:38.959 --> 22:40.393
He gets that
from his mom.

22:40.459 --> 22:42.092
No.

22:42.159 --> 22:43.558
He gets it
from both of you.

22:44.739 --> 22:45.760
Owen: well, well.

22:45.826 --> 22:47.127
Guess it's official.

22:47.193 --> 22:49.127
<i>They will let anyone play
in this league.</i>

22:49.193 --> 22:50.893
I see that.

22:50.961 --> 22:52.328
How you doing, man?
Good, man.

22:52.395 --> 22:54.128
You know skills, right?
What's up, skills?

22:56.116 --> 22:56.597
You really think victoria

22:56.632 --> 22:58.795
Could have done something
like that to you?

22:58.862 --> 23:01.129
No.

23:01.195 --> 23:04.095
I mean, i don't know.

23:04.163 --> 23:06.996
I think i needed somebody
to blame.

23:07.063 --> 23:09.629
I wish you would have
told me.

23:09.697 --> 23:13.264
I wanted to,
but i didn't know how.

23:13.331 --> 23:17.830
Honey, i am your best friend.
I love you.

23:17.898 --> 23:19.564
That is why you have me.

23:19.632 --> 23:23.233
And it kills me that i wasn't
able to be there for you.

23:23.299 --> 23:25.133
It's gonna sound weird,

23:25.199 --> 23:28.333
But i was just
really embarrassed.

23:28.401 --> 23:32.600
I felt weak and...

23:32.667 --> 23:35.001
<i>You and luke
were so happy,</i>

23:35.068 --> 23:37.468
And i did not want to ruin that
for you.

23:37.534 --> 23:38.701
No. Hey.

23:38.769 --> 23:40.735
<i>I never want you to think</i>

23:40.802 --> 23:44.036
That you can't come to me
for anything.

23:44.103 --> 23:45.770
I'm here for you
forever.

23:47.811 --> 23:48.603
Promise?

23:48.669 --> 23:50.337
Yeah!

23:50.405 --> 23:55.505
Of course i promise.
You're stuck with me.

23:55.570 --> 24:00.304
I'm really sorry
that i've been distant.

24:00.372 --> 24:02.005
I'm trying to get back.

24:02.073 --> 24:04.639
It's just gonna take
a little while.

24:04.706 --> 24:08.739
I'm not going
anywhere... ever.

24:12.974 --> 24:16.607
Lucas.
We need to talk.

24:16.674 --> 24:19.657
Okay, but, please,
when we get to seattle,

24:19.692 --> 24:22.254
Don't set me up
in the science-Fiction section.

24:22.290 --> 24:23.476
There isn't gonna be
a seattle.

24:24.786 --> 24:25.976
And what about the $est
of the tour?

24:26.044 --> 24:28.843
It's over.
I'm sorry.

24:28.910 --> 24:30.631
Because of one bad
signing?

24:30.666 --> 24:31.244
Let's face it.

24:31.310 --> 24:33.144
If they didn't come out
to see you here in omaha,

24:33.211 --> 24:36.178
They're not gonna come see you
in the bigger markets.

24:36.245 --> 24:40.512
I need to talk to lindsey.
She believes in this book.

24:40.578 --> 24:41.812
It wasn't her decision.

24:41.879 --> 24:43.312
And if it makes you feel
any better,

24:43.379 --> 24:45.079
She didn't agree with it.

24:45.147 --> 24:46.913
That's why you didn't read
the book.

24:46.980 --> 24:48.347
Lucas -

24:48.414 --> 24:52.013
You are - You knew this
was gonna happen.

24:52.081 --> 24:54.847
<i>They sent you to deliver
the bad news.</i>

24:54.914 --> 24:56.547
What are you -
The grim reaper?

24:56.615 --> 24:58.115
I've been called worse.

24:58.182 --> 24:59.915
I'm sure you have.

24:59.982 --> 25:01.149
I am sorry, lucas.

25:01.215 --> 25:02.915
Go home,
write another book.

25:02.983 --> 25:05.016
I promise i'll read
the next one.

25:05.083 --> 25:08.883
* guess it ends here *

25:12.683 --> 25:14.151
Oh.

25:14.218 --> 25:16.285
Dude, do you know what
this reminds me of? What?

25:16.352 --> 25:17.651
Um, remember second grade

25:17.718 --> 25:19.584
When you found out how much
money martha stewart made,

25:19.651 --> 25:21.318
And you started your own
cookie business?

25:21.386 --> 25:23.886
Oh, my god - Brookies.
Brookies!

25:23.952 --> 25:25.685
The only thing worse
than the name

25:25.752 --> 25:27.186
Was the actual cookie.

25:27.579 --> 25:28.763
???

25:28.798 --> 25:30.054
They were terrible!

25:30.120 --> 25:31.521
And you almost burnt
my house down.

25:31.586 --> 25:33.020
No. No, i didn't.
Yes, you did!

25:33.088 --> 25:34.988
I did not.
I set off one smoke detector,

25:35.055 --> 25:37.422
<i>And your dad acted like i almost
burned the house down.</i>

25:37.488 --> 25:38.988
<i>He was so mad at me.</i>

25:39.056 --> 25:40.688
No, he was just worried
about us.

25:40.755 --> 25:42.089
It felt kind of nice

25:42.156 --> 25:45.056
To have somebody worried
for a change.

25:45.123 --> 25:46.656
Hey, speaking of larry,

25:46.723 --> 25:49.524
Uh, you're not the only one
keeping secrets.

25:49.589 --> 25:52.424
I probably should have
told you this.

25:52.491 --> 25:55.091
I've met my birth dad.

25:55.158 --> 25:56.458
What?

25:56.526 --> 25:58.292
Yeah, it's mick -
The guitarist.

25:58.359 --> 26:00.392
Are you serious?
What's he like?

26:00.459 --> 26:03.691
Ohh. Um...
he's a mess.

26:03.759 --> 26:05.993
I mean, it's cool
that he's a musician,

26:06.060 --> 26:09.193
But he's just really not
what i expected him to be.

26:09.261 --> 26:12.261
Yeah, i'm sorry, peyton.

26:12.327 --> 26:14.194
I know how it feels.

26:14.262 --> 26:17.362
If only we could pick
our parents.

26:17.429 --> 26:20.129
Yeah, but then you look
at larry,

26:20.165 --> 26:22.525
<i>And it's pretty cool
when they get to pick you.</i>

26:29.364 --> 26:30.350
I'm sorry omaha
wasn't everything

26:30.385 --> 26:31.550
You hoped it would be,
luke.

26:31.617 --> 26:33.017
Oh, it isn't that bad.

26:33.118 --> 26:36.118
At least oed today was mine.9?

26:37.777 --> 26:38.944
How about you, huh?

26:39.012 --> 26:41.346
Is omaha everything
you hoped it would be?

26:41.411 --> 26:43.945
I like it here.
I mean, they love their sports.

26:44.012 --> 26:46.044
You should see this place during
the college world series.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.279
The whole city
gets into it.

26:49.295 --> 26:52.146
I have the job
i've always dreamed of.

26:52.214 --> 26:53.998
Well, it sounds like
you're right at home.

26:54.033 --> 26:56.109
<i>That's the thing.
It's not home.</i>

26:56.144 --> 26:58.151
At least not
without millie.

26:58.187 --> 26:59.887
Yeah, how is that
working for you?

26:59.953 --> 27:01.420
It hasn't been easy.

27:01.487 --> 27:04.387
The truth is
i'm kind of lost without her,

27:04.455 --> 27:06.787
But she knows how important
this job is to me,

27:06.854 --> 27:09.021
So we'll make it work.

27:09.089 --> 27:11.688
I'm sure you will.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.356
So, you're headed back
to tree hill.

27:13.422 --> 27:14.489
You gonna be okay?

27:14.557 --> 27:16.457
I'll survive.

27:16.524 --> 27:18.056
Like my mom always says,
you know,

27:18.123 --> 27:19.656
"Whenever you're having
a bad day,

27:19.723 --> 27:22.823
"Someone else out there
is having a worse day.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.690
So just stop and focus
on all the good things."

27:24.757 --> 27:26.057
I mean, think about it.
She's right.

27:26.124 --> 27:28.613
Today, i got to hang out
with one of my best friends,

27:28.649 --> 27:32.474
And then tonight,
i get to go home to peyton.

27:32.510 --> 27:35.026
Sounds like
a pretty good day.

27:35.093 --> 27:37.026
I mean, i'm not gonna lie.

27:37.093 --> 27:40.460
I was really looking forward
to this book tour.

27:40.528 --> 27:43.461
I guess i just
thought that...

27:43.528 --> 27:46.294
I'd be on top of the world
for a couple weeks.

27:46.362 --> 27:49.228
Yeah, me too.

28:10.399 --> 28:12.918
Hey, what's up, jamie?
How you doing, buddy?

28:12.953 --> 28:15.029
Sorry, owen.
I'm on team brooke.

28:15.065 --> 28:17.072
Did it just get cold
in here?

28:17.107 --> 28:20.306
Yeah, i don't blame him.
I screwed that up.

28:20.373 --> 28:22.439
<i>It's none
of my business, man.</i>

28:22.507 --> 28:25.008
So, what you think, man?
You gonna come play for us?

28:25.074 --> 28:26.008
We need a scorer.

28:26.074 --> 28:28.108
I - I don't know.

28:28.174 --> 28:31.075
It's fun out there, nate -
Flying through the air.

28:31.141 --> 28:32.775
Nothing like it.

28:32.843 --> 28:34.043
I'm just worried my back

28:34.110 --> 28:35.876
Can't take something like this
right now.

28:35.943 --> 28:36.824
It's not as bad
as it looks.

28:36.859 --> 28:38.809
Besides, they got springs
in the floor.

28:38.877 --> 28:40.810
It's gonna be easier
on your back than hardwood.

28:40.877 --> 28:42.310
Yeah, but
on a hardwood floor,

28:42.377 --> 28:44.077
The other players
can't knock you out.

28:44.143 --> 28:47.372
Just remember - They can't hit
you if they can't catch you.

28:48.144 --> 28:49.911
Ohh.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.378
That won't be you.

28:54.145 --> 28:56.178
<i>How do i look?</i>

28:56.245 --> 28:58.445
For a guy wearing too much
makeup, you look pretty cute.

28:58.513 --> 29:01.246
<i>Thanks.
I miss you.</i>

29:01.313 --> 29:03.680
<i>Omaha's just not the same
without you.</i>

29:03.748 --> 29:06.414
Tree hill's not the same
without you.

29:06.481 --> 29:07.748
Have a good show.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.224
Call me later.

29:10.850 --> 29:14.377
<i>Hi. I was just heading home.
What do you got there?</i>

29:14.412 --> 29:15.116
Cookies.

29:15.182 --> 29:17.383
They're mostly burnt, but it's
the thought that counts.

29:17.449 --> 29:18.516
Enjoy.

29:18.583 --> 29:19.850
Thanks.

29:19.916 --> 29:21.664
Um, i added a few more ideas
to the list.

29:23.617 --> 29:25.350
"Be a mom."

29:29.369 --> 29:31.752
It's no fun being alone.

29:31.818 --> 29:33.918
<i>Okay, before we jump
into the day's scores,</i>

29:33.986 --> 29:34.976
<i>I wanted to follow up
on a story</i>

29:35.011 --> 29:38.120
<i>We did a couple of weeks ago
about darren rivers.</i>

29:38.185 --> 29:40.479
<i>Now, for those of you
who just landed on earth,</i>

29:40.515 --> 29:41.773
<i>He's the pro-Bowl quarterback</i>

29:41.808 --> 29:43.108
<i>Who shocked the world
last month</i>

29:43.175 --> 29:44.575
<i>When he retired from the nfl,</i>

29:44.642 --> 29:48.075
<i>Turning down a $68 million
contract extension</i>

29:48.142 --> 29:50.775
<i>So he could spend more time
with his family.</i>

29:50.842 --> 29:53.587
<i>Now, naturally,
i put up a czy meter</i>

29:53.623 --> 29:55.384
<i>With darren's face
in the middle of it.</i>

29:55.419 --> 29:57.700
<i>I gave him an 8 out of 10.</i>

29:57.889 --> 30:00.944
<i>Well, it turns out he might be
the least crazy all of us.</i>

30:00.979 --> 30:03.999
<i>You see, he just realized
that money isn't everything.</i>

30:04.035 --> 30:05.557
<i>I think sometimes
we all lose sight</i>

30:05.592 --> 30:07.079
<i>Of what really matters
the most.</i>

30:07.145 --> 30:09.845
<i>Darren rivers just figured
it out before i did.</i>

30:09.913 --> 30:13.352
<i>So, darren, please accept
my sincere apology,</i>

30:13.387 --> 30:16.020
<i>And i'm officially moving you
down the crazy meter</i>

30:16.088 --> 30:17.288
<i>From an 8 to a 3.</i>

30:17.355 --> 30:18.404
<i>Because let's face it -</i>

30:18.439 --> 30:21.377
<i>You still turned down
$68 million.</i>

30:25.590 --> 30:27.389
<i>In the american league...
hello?</i>

30:27.457 --> 30:30.057
Hi. How's
my favorite author?

30:30.124 --> 30:32.557
He was just thinking
about his fiancéE.

30:32.623 --> 30:35.424
Oh, well, should i give you
five minutes?

30:35.492 --> 30:37.791
No, i was just packing.

30:37.858 --> 30:40.158
You off to seattle?

30:40.226 --> 30:42.593
Um...

30:43.258 --> 30:45.030
Actually,
i'm coming home.

30:45.065 --> 30:46.767
They canceled
my book tour.

30:46.803 --> 30:48.741
What are you
talking about? Why?

30:48.776 --> 30:50.863
It doesn't matter.

30:50.898 --> 30:54.131
<i>No, it does matter.
You worked so hard for this.</i>

30:54.167 --> 30:55.633
Hey, it's okay, peyton.

30:55.698 --> 30:57.832
I still have you, and that's all
that really matters.

30:57.900 --> 31:01.200
Besides, this book brought us
back together, so...

31:01.267 --> 31:03.233
It's the best thing
i've ever written.

31:03.301 --> 31:06.635
You come home to me, then.
I love you.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.700
I love you, too.

31:08.767 --> 31:11.401
I'll be home soon.
Bye.

31:13.536 --> 31:15.335
<i>...1-0.</i>

31:15.403 --> 31:17.203
<i>Two words - Batting practice.
Pass it on.</i>

31:17.270 --> 31:18.370
<i>This isn't soccer.</i>

31:18.436 --> 31:20.570
<i>That's it, omaha.</i>

31:20.637 --> 31:22.403
<i>I'm marvin mcfadden on sports,</i>

31:22.471 --> 31:24.471
<i>And you've just heard
a mouthful.</i>

31:24.538 --> 31:26.271
<i>We'll be right back
after this.</i>

31:37.905 --> 31:41.072
What are you doing here?

31:41.140 --> 31:43.740
It's kind of late
to be out alone.

31:43.807 --> 31:46.203
Well,
i don't have a curfew.

31:46.239 --> 31:47.141
Yeah. Hmm.

31:48.798 --> 31:50.898
I didn't have a curfew
either.

31:50.965 --> 31:52.698
When i was your age,

31:52.766 --> 31:56.400
It was just me
and my parents' credit cards.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.468
Lucky you.

31:59.533 --> 32:01.134
Not really.

32:02.018 --> 32:04.237
It would have been nice
to have someone to talk to.

32:04.273 --> 32:05.582
Parents are overrated.

32:05.617 --> 32:08.457
Sometimes.

32:09.708 --> 32:12.833
Two weeks ago, my mom told me
she never wanted me.

32:12.868 --> 32:15.967
Well... my mom gave me up
when i was born,

32:16.034 --> 32:19.568
So, in a way,
she told me she didn't want me.

32:19.634 --> 32:22.435
At least she didn't wait
35 years like yours did.

32:22.503 --> 32:25.102
I'm not 35!

32:25.169 --> 32:27.802
Do i look 35 to you?!

32:27.870 --> 32:32.370
I don't know.
Uh, look, i-I got to get going.

32:32.437 --> 32:33.970
Like you said,
it's getting late.

32:34.037 --> 32:35.104
Listen.

32:35.171 --> 32:37.371
Look, i know this is...

32:37.438 --> 32:39.071
Totally out of the blue,

32:39.138 --> 32:43.471
And i'm surprising myself
by saying it, but...

32:43.539 --> 32:47.372
I have an extra room,
and it's yours if you want it.

32:47.440 --> 32:50.672
You can come and go
as you please - Whatever.

32:50.739 --> 32:52.973
So, what do you say?

32:53.040 --> 32:56.174
I don't need this.
I can take care of myself.

32:56.241 --> 32:57.640
Yeah, i know you can,

32:57.708 --> 33:01.475
???Right now.

33:01.542 --> 33:06.008
* moon pours through
the ceiling tonight *

33:06.076 --> 33:08.467
Sam, if you're that
uncomfortable in my house,

33:08.502 --> 33:10.675
You can always sleep
in my car.

33:13.710 --> 33:20.445
* shows me we're right
for each other *

33:23.446 --> 33:25.279
You don't come around
for 22 years,

33:25.346 --> 33:27.912
And now you won't go.

33:27.980 --> 33:30.614
Well, i wanted to leave you
with something.

33:30.679 --> 33:34.480
This chip is the only truly
meaningful thing that i own,

33:34.548 --> 33:37.481
And, um, now it's yours.

33:40.349 --> 33:44.349
That was ellie's the year
she was pregnant with you.

33:44.415 --> 33:48.948
And, uh, to tell the truth,
you saved her life, peyton.

33:49.016 --> 33:53.682
She was hell-Bent on staying
sober during the pregnancy,

33:53.750 --> 33:55.917
And that was hard for her.

33:55.984 --> 33:58.618
* only the heartaches
have given me sight *

33:58.684 --> 34:01.951
<i>But it was so much harder
giving you up.</i>

34:02.018 --> 34:05.252
Then why did she?

34:05.319 --> 34:06.819
Because we thought
there was a better life

34:06.886 --> 34:08.784
For you out there.

34:08.851 --> 34:12.353
We couldn't raise a kid,
not in our world.

34:12.420 --> 34:16.219
But i don't think ellie
ever really got past it.

34:18.853 --> 34:21.088
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

34:22.955 --> 34:25.356
I don't know.

34:25.422 --> 34:26.822
Maybi didn't want
to mess

34:26.889 --> 34:27.710
With the picture you had
in your head

34:27.746 --> 34:31.688
Of what your birth father
was really like -

34:31.755 --> 34:35.623
Something better than me,
something more heroic.

34:37.790 --> 34:41.824
I guess i just didn't want
to disappoint you.

34:41.891 --> 34:44.492
* more than yesterday *

34:44.559 --> 34:46.626
Anyhow,
i, uh, made a few calls.

34:46.692 --> 34:48.092
I'm gonna jump
on the last leg

34:48.159 --> 34:50.493
Of this tour
for a few weeks.

34:50.560 --> 34:51.993
It's what i do.

34:54.327 --> 34:57.693
I'm sorry.

34:57.760 --> 35:03.461
* only the heartaches
have given me sight *

35:05.563 --> 35:08.112
People always leave?

35:09.596 --> 35:13.029
Sometimes that's
a good thing, huh?

35:13.097 --> 35:17.675
But, for what it's worth,
you're doing great, kid.

35:21.565 --> 35:23.632
I'll see ya.

35:24.899 --> 35:27.065
Mick.

35:27.132 --> 35:29.065
Thank you.

35:29.133 --> 35:31.033
For what?

35:31.100 --> 35:35.167
For giving me up.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.800
* yeah, yeah *

35:45.968 --> 35:47.569
Oh.

35:54.571 --> 35:56.304
Ugh.

36:02.639 --> 36:04.005
Hey.

36:04.071 --> 36:05.572
These are for you.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.705
I just figured you deserve
to be with somebody

36:07.772 --> 36:08.805
Who gave you flowers.

36:08.872 --> 36:11.839
Mmm, they're perfect.

36:20.575 --> 36:23.542
Hey! Saw the show.

36:23.609 --> 36:25.009
What'd you think?

36:25.075 --> 36:26.708
You were great, mouth.

36:26.775 --> 36:28.643
Thanks.
What time's your flight?

36:28.709 --> 36:30.982
About an hour.

36:31.017 --> 36:32.809
Well, i have
this crazy idea.

36:32.876 --> 36:34.377
What if you didn't
get on it?

36:34.444 --> 36:37.777
No offense, mouth,
but i cangt be your millie.

36:37.844 --> 36:40.178
<i>What do you think
about driving back?</i>

36:42.878 --> 36:44.179
You're coming home.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.612
I guess i never
really left.

36:46.679 --> 36:48.946
Yeah, but what about
your dream job?

36:49.013 --> 36:51.046
Dream job or dream girl?

36:51.113 --> 36:52.913
Dream girl.

36:52.980 --> 36:54.347
No contest.

36:54.414 --> 36:56.914
Although i'm kind of becoming
the flakiest employee ever,

36:56.980 --> 36:58.214
But i don't care.

36:58.281 --> 37:00.281
I miss millie,
and i miss my friends.

37:00.348 --> 37:01.981
It just took me
a little while

37:02.048 --> 37:03.787
To realize
what was important.

37:05.782 --> 37:07.349
All right, let's do it.
Yes!

37:07.416 --> 37:09.082
But i'm driving.
You got a book to read.

37:09.149 --> 37:10.749
<i>Are you gonna make me read
your book</i>

37:10.816 --> 37:12.150
<i>With you sitting
right next to me?</i>

37:12.217 --> 37:14.517
Cover to cover.

37:14.584 --> 37:15.883
I may even quiz you.

37:15.950 --> 37:17.716
Well, it's aaood thing
i like science fiction.

37:17.784 --> 37:18.652
Ohh.

37:20.806 --> 37:25.884

of some new disgrace *

37:25.952 --> 37:27.319
* her whole story
was so obvious to me *

37:27.386 --> 37:29.052
Did you make the team?

37:29.120 --> 37:32.287
Well, that all depends
on what my wife thinks.

37:32.353 --> 37:34.587
This league is -
Is different.

37:34.655 --> 37:35.921
Different how?

37:35.987 --> 37:37.954
Well,

37:38.021 --> 37:40.687
<i>It's called slamball?</i>

37:40.755 --> 37:41.988
Yeah.

37:42.055 --> 37:43.788
That sounds physical.

37:43.855 --> 37:45.088
It's not... really.

37:45.155 --> 37:48.788
It's a lot of dunking,
and it's kind of

37:48.856 --> 37:50.756
It's called slamball.

37:50.822 --> 37:52.123
Uh...

37:52.190 --> 37:53.889
Look, here's the thing.

37:53.957 --> 37:55.257
I'm not ready
to give it up yet,

37:55.324 --> 37:56.890
But no team is gonna give me
a tryout

37:56.957 --> 37:58.291
Unless i prove
that i'm healthy.

37:58.357 --> 38:01.291
So i thought this would...

38:01.358 --> 38:03.858
I don't know.

38:03.925 --> 38:06.659
<i>You really think
you can still play?</i>

38:06.725 --> 38:09.226
<i>I know i can.</i>

38:09.293 --> 38:12.466
And no one else
will give you a tryout?

38:14.294 --> 38:15.860
Make that shot.

38:23.095 --> 38:26.129
Okay. Back up now
and try it again.

One more time.

38:33.896 --> 38:39.763
* there were things

38:39.830 --> 38:44.631
They are crazy
not to give you a tryout.

38:44.698 --> 38:46.599
Ugh.

39:06.835 --> 39:11.002

under the doctor's knife *

39:11.070 --> 39:13.537
* is that we're the same *
