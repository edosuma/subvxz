11:12.922 --> 11:15.841
Hey Bart...
Uh, I mean, Jesus.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.344
Hey son, you want Flanders
to kill anybody?

11:18.427 --> 11:19.804
He's totally in my power.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.807
Well, there's a tall boy in front of me
in class, so I can't see the board.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.934
And I sayeth unto you,

11:25.017 --> 11:27.645
slay every tall boy in town!

11:27.728 --> 11:28.729
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

11:28.813 --> 11:30.564
-Homer Simpson!
-(shrieks)

11:30.648 --> 11:32.316
You made a killer out of me!

11:32.400 --> 11:34.568
Yeah, and what are you gonna do
about it?

11:34.652 --> 11:37.446
-I'm going to kill you!
-(shrieks)

11:37.530 --> 11:39.532
Because of you,
I'm going to Hell!

11:39.615 --> 11:40.616
Language.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.743
Hell!
Damn! Backside!

11:42.827 --> 11:43.994
Nothing matters anymore!

11:44.078 --> 11:47.081
I'm goin' down and my hand-basket
seats two!

11:47.164 --> 11:49.250
(scoffs)
Wake up, Flanders!

11:49.333 --> 11:52.211
There is no Hell,
and there is no God.

11:52.294 --> 11:55.005
If there were,
would He let me do this?

11:57.591 --> 11:59.844
(gasping and wailing)

11:59.927 --> 12:01.679
GOD:
Why you little...

12:01.762 --> 12:05.099
(choking)

12:05.182 --> 12:06.350
(gasps)

12:06.434 --> 12:08.018
What happened?!

12:08.102 --> 12:10.771
Uh... Flanders killed Homer.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.357
-But, but...
-But you're God.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.776
Couldn't you make everything
the way it was?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.528
Well, I could.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.698
But the big man downstairs
wouldn't like it.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.116
(murmurs)

12:23.576 --> 12:25.494
Get me a coffee!

12:25.578 --> 12:27.288
Yes, sir.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.127
Could this get any worse?

12:35.045 --> 12:37.047
Honey, come back to bed.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.383
-Oh, for cryin' out loud!
-(Satan chuckles)

12:48.893 --> 12:50.144
(indistinct voices)

12:50.227 --> 12:51.604
People, you are on the most

12:51.687 --> 12:54.315
inhospitable planet
in the galaxy.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.150
Extreme temperatures...

12:56.233 --> 12:58.152
vicious indigenous life forms...

12:58.235 --> 13:00.571
Are there any questions? Yes?

13:00.654 --> 13:03.324
-Are we in Kansas anymore?
-No.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.825
Well, are we in Nebraska?

13:04.909 --> 13:07.244
No!
We are not in any state!

13:07.328 --> 13:09.163
Oh, oh, is it Michigan?

13:09.246 --> 13:11.165
Nobody talk anymore!

13:11.248 --> 13:14.335
You will now direct your
attention to our C.E.O.,

13:14.418 --> 13:15.628
Mr. Krusty the Clown.

13:15.711 --> 13:19.215
<i>We are here on this fakakta planet</i>
<i>for one reason:</i>

13:19.298 --> 13:20.633
<i>Hilarium.</i>

13:20.716 --> 13:23.969
<i>Spray this in an audience</i>
<i>and they'll laugh at anything.</i>

13:24.053 --> 13:25.387
<i>And I need some now.</i>

13:25.471 --> 13:27.807
<i>Gotta play a Nazi party rally.</i>

13:27.890 --> 13:29.683
<i>Oh, yeah, they're back.</i>

13:29.767 --> 13:33.437
Our spies will go planet-side,
locate said Hilarium

13:33.521 --> 13:36.273
and contact us so that we may
begin extraction.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.568
This is a delicate mission
that requires utter loyalty.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.445
I can think of no better candidate

13:41.529 --> 13:45.032
than the resentful guy in the wheelchair
who has just arrived.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.746
Yes, I think this is gonna
work out just fine.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.459
All strapped in?

13:55.543 --> 13:56.752
Yep.

13:58.295 --> 14:02.007
Now prepare to take an incredible
journey across the room!

14:02.091 --> 14:04.885
(whooshing)

14:06.303 --> 14:07.638
Yo.

14:14.228 --> 14:17.898
Whoa!
Check out this bitchin' bod!

14:17.982 --> 14:20.025
Oh, man, if I could just have

14:20.109 --> 14:22.653
five minutes alone
with my old bullies...

14:22.736 --> 14:23.904
Hey, avaturd.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.155
Are you guys gonna beat me up?

14:25.239 --> 14:26.198
Naw, we can't.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.742
These avatars cost
$80 billion each.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.745
But your human body costs nothing.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.498
(grunting and groaning)

14:34.582 --> 14:36.667
(skunk chittering)

14:38.252 --> 14:40.337
(chuckling)

14:40.421 --> 14:43.090
(creature growling)

14:43.173 --> 14:44.675
(grunting)

14:44.758 --> 14:46.218
Whoa!

14:46.302 --> 14:49.138
Come on, let's bond,
you stupid jerk.

14:50.556 --> 14:54.393
That's a Japanese outlet, Bart.
You need an adapter.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.812
-(groaning)
-(zapping)

14:56.896 --> 14:59.315
Oh, maybe I'll just take a taxi.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.858
Where you go?
Where you go?

15:00.941 --> 15:02.151
No meter, is cheaper, yeah?

15:02.234 --> 15:03.360
No, thanks.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.946
Suit yourself,
you one-eyed bastard.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.448
(grunts)

15:07.531 --> 15:09.825
Aw, the only thing that looks
good on this stupid planet

15:09.909 --> 15:10.868
are the bananas.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.330
Hmm?!

15:14.413 --> 15:16.373
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

15:16.457 --> 15:20.294
(battle cry)

15:28.010 --> 15:29.219
Thanks, dude.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.971
I am a female!

15:31.055 --> 15:32.306
You don't have to yell!

15:32.389 --> 15:35.643
I am not yelling!
This is my seductive voice!

15:35.726 --> 15:38.896
I am called Kamala.

15:38.979 --> 15:42.399
Oh! Even when we're monsters,
he gets the girl.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.484
(grunts)

15:43.567 --> 15:46.612
Fool! Every part of this world
is alive!

15:46.695 --> 15:48.948
Apologize to sister rock!

15:49.031 --> 15:51.116
Sorry, sister rock.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.703
Now you've murdered our
brothers, the flowers!

15:54.787 --> 15:56.455
Stupid! Stupid!

15:56.538 --> 15:58.791
Now you're having sex
with uncle tree!

15:58.874 --> 16:00.167
(groans)

16:00.250 --> 16:02.586
Thank the Almighty Fungus
you are wiser

16:02.670 --> 16:04.505
and cuter than your friend.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.091
Hey, what gives, man?

16:07.174 --> 16:10.302
And now let us touch testicles
and mate for life.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.012
Don't you mean tentacles?

16:12.096 --> 16:13.681
I know what I said!

16:13.764 --> 16:15.557
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

16:15.641 --> 16:17.851
(zapping)

16:19.019 --> 16:22.481
Today you are a man.
Mazel Tov!

16:27.695 --> 16:29.822
So... was it okay?

16:29.905 --> 16:31.490
It was serviceable!

16:31.573 --> 16:35.327
Ah, man, back on Earth
we don't have so many moons.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.497
What do you mean,
"back on Earth"?

16:38.580 --> 16:43.502
Uh... it's a place on the other
side of this planet that's...

16:43.585 --> 16:46.255
very rainy so you can only see
one moon.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.589
You know, like Portland.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.883
I never hear of this Port-land.

16:49.967 --> 16:54.221
But on Rigel Seven, lack of eye contact
and too many details

16:54.304 --> 16:56.724
indicate the telling of truth.

16:56.807 --> 17:00.060
I love you, sugar-slime.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.062
(smooching)

17:02.146 --> 17:04.023
Man, you are full
of surprises.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.858
(squawking)

17:05.941 --> 17:09.236
I can't believe I'm getting
combat pay for this.

17:09.319 --> 17:13.073
Well done, young man!
Our daughter is with child.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.158
Here.

17:14.241 --> 17:17.244
Feel the wonder of
one million fetuses!

17:17.327 --> 17:20.247
(grunts) You said you
were using birth control!

17:20.330 --> 17:23.834
That only keeps me from giving birth
while we are having sex.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.544
(moans)

17:25.627 --> 17:27.421
How do those mountains float?

17:27.504 --> 17:29.923
They don't.
They are falling.

17:30.007 --> 17:33.427
Now that Kamala
has a slug in the oven,

17:33.510 --> 17:37.681
we must make sure she gets
her daily dose of Hilarium.

17:37.765 --> 17:41.769
Without it, her crankiness
will become unbearable.

17:41.852 --> 17:45.689
Unfortunately our environment
is too hostile to grow pickles.

17:45.773 --> 17:49.234
And the only flavor ice cream
we have is butter brickle.

17:49.318 --> 17:52.529
To repeat: no pickles,
butter brickle.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.782
It is the Rigelian way.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.950
So, where can I load up on this
Hilarium?

17:57.034 --> 17:58.786
Listen closely.

17:58.869 --> 18:03.707
The Hilarium is found in the
sacred secretions of the queen!

18:10.380 --> 18:11.298
(dialing phone)

18:11.381 --> 18:12.966
We have located the Hilarium.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.219
Lock in on my signal.

18:15.302 --> 18:19.389
Traitor! How dare you betray
the planet I got laid on?!

18:21.600 --> 18:25.104
They're all in one place.
Let's fry these calamari

18:25.187 --> 18:27.731
and dip 'em in a sauce made
of their own blood!

18:27.815 --> 18:29.900
And wine from
their own grapes.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.193
That's not so bad.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.861
It's a little bad.

18:39.076 --> 18:42.204
So Kamala, where do we keep all
our tanks and planes and stuff?

18:42.287 --> 18:45.999
We have no tanks.
Our planet will protect us.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.210
Oh, man,
you sound like my art teacher.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.711
Look a little like her, too.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.172
(snarling)

18:52.256 --> 18:55.342
(bellowing)

19:03.225 --> 19:04.935
(shouting)

19:05.018 --> 19:06.311
(growling)

19:08.730 --> 19:10.149
(squawking)

19:13.110 --> 19:14.236
(yelling)

19:20.659 --> 19:22.578
(hooting)

19:22.661 --> 19:26.373
(battle cry)

19:26.456 --> 19:28.167
I guess this is a good time
to tell you

19:28.250 --> 19:30.085
I've been a double agent
all this time.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.920
But now I am
totally on your side.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.757
And this is a good time to tell you
I have space warts.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.509
And I got them
from Milhouse.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.510
(gasps)

19:43.765 --> 19:46.059
Time for a good old-fashioned

19:46.143 --> 19:49.271
servo-suit/bulldozer-saurus fight!

19:53.150 --> 19:55.319
(grunting)

19:56.945 --> 19:58.697
(growling)

19:58.780 --> 20:00.115
Dammit!

20:00.199 --> 20:02.618
Yo, Colonel! Uh, you've got
some schmutz on your cheek.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.037
Where? Here?

20:05.120 --> 20:07.664
Skinner...!

20:10.209 --> 20:12.252
Had they asked
for the Hilarium,

20:12.336 --> 20:14.588
we would simply have
given it to them.

20:14.671 --> 20:18.383
In Rigelian there is no word
for "yours" or "mine."

20:18.467 --> 20:20.677
That's the reason we didn't
enjoy the movie

20:20.761 --> 20:22.221
<i>Yours, Mine and Ours.</i>

20:22.304 --> 20:25.224
(somber music plays)

20:26.683 --> 20:29.269
Halloween is over,
which means, America,

20:29.353 --> 20:31.563
it's time to start your
Christmas shopping.

20:31.647 --> 20:35.234
Infuse our stagnant economy
with dollars you don't really have.

20:35.317 --> 20:39.655
And whatever you do, avoid the urge
to make homemade gifts.

20:39.738 --> 20:44.826
Knitting one sweater for someone
costs 27 Americans their jobs.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.329
And don't forget,
Christmas is a wonderful time

20:47.412 --> 20:49.081
to take up alcoholism.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.375
Come on, you see your
family all year round.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.503
The holidays are for
your bartender. (laughs)

20:54.586 --> 20:57.506
("Carol of the Bells" plays)

21:01.301 --> 21:04.388
When are we doing
the <i>Black Swan?</i>

21:04.471 --> 21:06.265
(moans)

21:52.060 --> 21:53.478
