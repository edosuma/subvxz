00:12.960 --> 00:15.962
ARCHIE: Don't forget, Dunc,
these are wild animals,
they're unpredictable.

00:16.046 --> 00:17.840
I always think how
harmless they look.

00:17.924 --> 00:20.509
Remind me of that
dog my granny had,
great brute of a thing.

00:20.593 --> 00:23.012
He was a West
Highland Terrier.

00:23.094 --> 00:25.972
Yeah, but I was only a wee boy
so it seemed huge to me.

00:26.056 --> 00:29.351
Well, harmless or not,
these wolves keep
bringing the visitors in.

00:31.644 --> 00:34.065
Golly, you know,
you should take a leaf
out of Duncan's book.

00:34.148 --> 00:37.567
Would that be his Beano annual
or his computer game magazine?

00:37.651 --> 00:40.071
Well, you can't.
I haven't even read them yet.

00:40.154 --> 00:42.155
No, I mean show
a bit of enthusiasm.

00:42.239 --> 00:44.908
If it wasn't for Dunc,
we wouldn't have this
party of naturalists coming.

00:44.991 --> 00:46.160
This could be the start
of big things.

00:46.911 --> 00:48.829
Well done.

00:48.912 --> 00:50.706
-I'll leave you to it, yeah?
-Okay, boss.

00:55.670 --> 00:58.129
You see that,
I saw an opportunity
and I grabbed it.

00:58.213 --> 01:01.007
No, son, the phone
rang and you picked it up.

01:01.091 --> 01:03.802
I've left my gloves inside,
you take the barrow
and I'll finish up here,

01:03.885 --> 01:07.348
-then we'll both
get something to eat.
-Okey-dokey.

01:07.431 --> 01:13.144
Oh, and Golly,
you've got to make
hay while the iron's hot.

02:40.607 --> 02:42.692
Another spoonful of beans?

02:42.776 --> 02:44.195
No, no, that's plenty for me,
thanks.

02:44.278 --> 02:46.364
Duncan?

02:46.447 --> 02:48.658
-No, I'm fine, thanks.
-Well, as long as you're
keeping your strength up.

02:50.075 --> 02:51.660
LEXIE: Lunch plates.

02:51.743 --> 02:54.622
Just toss 'em in the sink.

02:54.705 --> 02:57.374
Did you hear
about the naturalists
that booked in, Lex?

02:57.458 --> 02:59.417
Archie says it could be
the start of big things.

02:59.501 --> 03:01.504
I know, it's amazing.

03:01.586 --> 03:03.296
You'll be tying
your own shoelaces next.

03:05.424 --> 03:06.800
IRENE:
Were the fishcakes okay?

03:06.884 --> 03:09.303
Very nice.
Best I've ever tasted in fact.

03:09.386 --> 03:11.389
Go on, you're
just saying that.

03:11.472 --> 03:13.807
Absolutely not.
It's a rare gift you have with
the seasoning there, Irene.

03:13.890 --> 03:15.393
Hasn't she?

03:15.475 --> 03:19.188
Um,
yeah, I didn't really notice.

03:19.272 --> 03:21.064
How could you not notice?

03:21.147 --> 03:23.568
I just whacked
the ketchup on and ate them.

03:23.651 --> 03:26.946
-No change there then, eh?
-Oh, go on,
he's a growing lad.

03:27.029 --> 03:28.573
Anyway,
it's time we weren't here.

03:28.656 --> 03:30.366
Another five minutes?

03:30.449 --> 03:33.744
Well, you can have another
five minutes, I've got
the feed figures to do.

03:33.827 --> 03:37.414
Oh, Irene, don't let
him take advantage of you.

04:06.775 --> 04:09.654
-Arch, did he find you?
-Who?

04:09.739 --> 04:10.907
Kilwillie.

04:10.990 --> 04:12.282
When?

04:12.365 --> 04:13.867
So you haven't seen him?

04:13.950 --> 04:15.453
Not today, no.

04:16.954 --> 04:19.207
I knew it.

04:19.290 --> 04:20.374
Lex,
what are you talking about?

04:20.458 --> 04:21.791
Well, he's here again.

04:22.334 --> 04:23.753
Kilwillie?

04:23.836 --> 04:24.961
Yes.

04:25.045 --> 04:27.089
So?

04:27.173 --> 04:30.343
So, he made out that he
was coming to see you,
but obviously he wasn't.

04:30.426 --> 04:34.430
So he was here to see
someone else. And no prizes
for guessing who.

04:34.513 --> 04:38.184
Why don't I go back outside
and we can start
this all over again?

04:38.267 --> 04:40.478
He's after Molly.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.021
After her for what?

04:42.104 --> 04:43.897
Well, for anything he can get.

04:45.065 --> 04:47.109
God, he fancies her, Arch.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.575
Ah! You almost had me there.

04:56.452 --> 04:57.662
I'm being serious.

04:57.745 --> 04:59.079
Yeah, course you are.

05:11.592 --> 05:12.760
(CAR HONKING)

05:31.319 --> 05:32.697
Welcome to Glenbogle!

05:32.780 --> 05:36.241
Lovely spot. Secluded, too.

05:36.324 --> 05:39.871
-It'll suit, then?
-It's perfect.
Sorry, you're, uh?

05:39.954 --> 05:42.414
Duncan, campsite manager.

05:42.497 --> 05:43.582
I'm Ian.

05:43.665 --> 05:45.501
-Hello.
-Gail.

05:45.585 --> 05:47.502
-Hello.
-And this is our daughter,
Heather.

05:47.878 --> 05:50.297
Hello.

05:50.381 --> 05:53.759
It's good of you to have us.
There's lots of places won't.

05:53.843 --> 05:56.970
-Why's that, then?
-They think
we're a bit strange.

05:57.054 --> 05:58.638
I don't understand.

05:58.723 --> 06:01.142
No, neither do we.

06:01.224 --> 06:04.270
So, are you in tune with
nature yourself, Duncan?

06:05.812 --> 06:07.898
Every chance I can get.

06:07.981 --> 06:11.611
Which must be quite often
I would imagine, living and
working in a place like this.

06:11.694 --> 06:15.238
Well, you know,
it's one of the reasons
I love the job.

06:15.322 --> 06:19.494
You get so much time outside.

06:19.576 --> 06:21.037
And work uninhibited?

06:21.120 --> 06:23.956
I'd say I was pretty
much my own boss, yes.

06:24.039 --> 06:25.749
I'd say you're all
as sad as each other.

06:25.832 --> 06:27.959
Because I like what I do?

06:28.043 --> 06:30.295
Because you have
to boast about it.

06:30.378 --> 06:34.716
Take no notice. This is just
because we wouldn't let her
stay at home by herself.

06:34.799 --> 06:38.053
Listen, once we're settled,
come back and have
a drink and a proper chat.

06:39.388 --> 06:40.680
Are you sure?

06:40.764 --> 06:42.432
I insist.

06:42.516 --> 06:45.685
It's always nice to
meet a fellow enthusiast.

06:45.769 --> 06:50.483
And if you'd like to
see the Wildlife Centre,
then I'm your man.

06:50.565 --> 06:52.943
Thanks for the offer,
but I think it's best if
we stay out of the way.

06:53.026 --> 06:54.946
It's no trouble. Honestly.

07:01.284 --> 07:04.372
-GAIL: Now that's what I
call open-minded.
-IAN: Aye.

07:05.665 --> 07:07.875
Wish we'd found
this place years ago.

07:20.345 --> 07:23.850
Yes, this call came
right out of the blue
from Stinky Perkins.

07:23.933 --> 07:29.981
He's a very old chum of mine,
disgustingly rich.
He's bought himself a villa.

07:30.064 --> 07:34.944
KILWILLIE: Just outside a
little Greek fishing village.
Anyway, here's the nub,

07:35.027 --> 07:39.072
I can have
the run of the place
whenever the fancy takes.

07:39.156 --> 07:42.409
Lucky old you. Nice bit
of Mediterranean sunshine
will do you a power of good.

07:43.995 --> 07:48.623
Uh, I was just wondering
if you might like
a little break?

07:50.750 --> 07:53.921
That's very thoughtful of you
but he's your friend,
you must go.

07:55.255 --> 07:57.967
Well, I was thinking
both of us together.

08:00.426 --> 08:01.970
(STAMMERING)

08:02.053 --> 08:06.391
Not together, together.
Everything above board,
naturally.

08:10.312 --> 08:12.356
So, does the idea appeal
at all?

08:13.565 --> 08:15.526
Well, it would be lovely.

08:15.610 --> 08:18.488
Marvellous,
let's synchronise diaries,
then, shall we?

08:18.570 --> 08:23.825
The thing is, though, I can't
leave Glenbogle at the moment.
There is so much going on.

08:24.868 --> 08:26.704
Perhaps another time.

08:28.372 --> 08:31.333
I see. Quite understand.

08:32.835 --> 08:34.919
I'll tell Stinky no, then.

08:35.004 --> 08:36.172
You could still go, though.

08:37.547 --> 08:39.509
No. It wouldn't be the same.

08:41.551 --> 08:44.430
Besides, if it's getting a
bit hectic, you never know
when you might need me.

09:02.113 --> 09:03.240
What?

09:05.201 --> 09:07.370
I think you were right.

09:07.453 --> 09:11.332
I usually am.
About anything specifically?

09:11.414 --> 09:14.544
Kilwillie making
advances to my mother.

09:14.627 --> 09:17.255
He's only gone and asked her
on some exotic holiday.

09:17.338 --> 09:19.006
Well, that might be
what she needs.

09:19.090 --> 09:21.175
It's exactly what
she doesn't need.

09:21.259 --> 09:22.551
Anyway, she said no.

09:22.634 --> 09:24.803
So, what's the problem?

09:24.886 --> 09:28.558
-I'm not having it.
-Well, neither's Kilwillie
by the sounds of things.

09:31.643 --> 09:36.274
I'm going to have
a word with him.
My mother is out of bounds.

09:36.357 --> 09:39.818
Archie, she's got a lot of
years ahead of her.

09:39.901 --> 09:41.570
You can't expect her
to spend them alone.

09:51.663 --> 09:52.915
Hi, it's me, Duncan.

09:53.790 --> 09:54.791
Hello there. Come on in.

09:56.001 --> 09:58.004
I'll come back
when you're dressed.

09:58.087 --> 09:59.796
How do you mean?

09:59.880 --> 10:01.382
You haven't got your shirt on.

10:01.464 --> 10:04.635
I haven't got anything on,
have we, darling?

10:04.719 --> 10:06.304
Just my flip-flops.

10:08.722 --> 10:10.183
Have you lost your luggage?

10:10.266 --> 10:11.267
No.

10:12.142 --> 10:14.770
You've been for a swim.

10:14.853 --> 10:17.272
This is how we unwind,
but you knew that.

10:19.274 --> 10:21.819
You are the naturalists?

10:22.862 --> 10:25.530
Close. We're naturists.

10:27.282 --> 10:31.996
You mean,
you walk around in the bufty?

10:36.041 --> 10:37.584
You can't.

10:37.667 --> 10:40.962
Oh, I think you'll find
we can. Fancy a beer?

10:41.463 --> 10:43.007
(GASPS)

10:55.770 --> 10:56.771
Kilwillie?

10:58.564 --> 11:01.066
-You wanted to see me?
-Did I?

11:01.149 --> 11:02.150
According to Lexie.

11:04.028 --> 11:05.946
-Oh, yes.
-So, what is it?

11:06.029 --> 11:09.491
(STAMMERING) It was
just the, um, um,

11:11.994 --> 11:14.496
the Landowners
Association annual dinner.

11:14.580 --> 11:15.956
I was just wondering
how many tickets
you might need.

11:17.041 --> 11:18.709
That's months away.

11:18.792 --> 11:20.920
Oh, best to get in early.

11:21.002 --> 11:23.172
Which is why
there were only seven
of us at the last one?

11:26.425 --> 11:28.594
Well, I'll put you down
as a "don't know" then,
shall I?

11:35.100 --> 11:36.768
It's the most natural thing
in the world, Duncan.

11:36.853 --> 11:39.105
Letting your body
soak up the sun's rays.

11:40.689 --> 11:43.150
I'm not sure that it's for me.

11:43.233 --> 11:45.694
I can promise you
there's nothing like it.

11:45.778 --> 11:49.824
Yes, I think you'll be seeing
a lot more of us up here once
I start spreading the word.

11:49.906 --> 11:52.159
-What word?
-Suitability.

11:52.242 --> 11:56.289
I'm president of
the Highland and Western
Isles Naturist Society,

11:56.372 --> 11:58.915
so I always like to check out
a new site first.

11:58.999 --> 12:02.461
But Glenbogle gets
the big thumbs up so far.

12:02.545 --> 12:05.589
-Have you got the sun
cream out there, Dad?
-Aye, come and join us.

12:06.299 --> 12:07.841
Is that your daughter?

12:07.924 --> 12:10.386
Very careful not to get burnt.
Here she is.

12:15.098 --> 12:16.725
But you've got
your clothes on!

12:16.808 --> 12:18.852
Sorry to disappoint you.

12:18.935 --> 12:21.813
No, no, I just mean
what with the sun cream.

12:22.481 --> 12:23.815
My arms.

12:23.899 --> 12:26.151
Not feeling the urge
to get them off, then?

12:26.234 --> 12:29.070
I was just explaining to our
friend here about the benefits
of the lifestyle.

12:29.155 --> 12:32.949
That's not what I'd call them.
I thought you were one of
the great undressed anyway.

12:33.034 --> 12:37.329
-Oh, misunderstanding.
-What, you mean you're normal?
Thank goodness.

12:45.629 --> 12:47.131
Hello!

12:49.049 --> 12:52.886
-Oh, hello yourself.
-Oh, hi, Lexie.

12:52.969 --> 12:55.138
There's no need to
look so disappointed.

12:55.223 --> 12:56.223
I was not.

12:57.683 --> 12:59.434
So, was it Irene
you were after?

12:59.518 --> 13:01.603
Maybe.

13:01.686 --> 13:06.274
You know, if I didn't know any
better, I would say you
were soft on her.

13:07.026 --> 13:08.485
I am no such thing.

13:09.195 --> 13:10.612
If you say so.

13:10.695 --> 13:11.696
Yes, I do.

13:12.989 --> 13:14.826
You know,
she's a fine-looking woman.

13:14.909 --> 13:18.162
That is as may be, Lexie,
but that doesn't mean...

13:18.621 --> 13:21.164
I know.

13:21.248 --> 13:22.791
I just think you'd be good
for each other, that's all.

13:24.919 --> 13:28.172
But it's none of my business,
eh?

14:06.460 --> 14:07.919
It's inspiring, isn't it?

14:08.587 --> 14:12.091
Mmm. It is.

14:12.175 --> 14:16.386
I've found the answer to many
a problem just looking out
over the water.

14:16.470 --> 14:21.183
Is that what you're doing now?
Seeking solutions?

14:21.266 --> 14:26.396
More guidance really.
Not for myself, mind,
but for a friend.

14:29.859 --> 14:31.569
Can I help?

14:31.652 --> 14:33.945
Maybe.

14:34.029 --> 14:38.533
He, this friend of mine,
he's reached a certain age.

14:39.618 --> 14:40.827
Haven't we all?

14:42.454 --> 14:45.583
-There's nothing we can
do about it, I'm afraid.
-No.

14:45.665 --> 14:48.418
No, but the thing is that
there's a woman that
he's become fond of.

14:52.881 --> 14:54.258
Has he told her?

14:55.175 --> 14:57.469
No, no, not in so many words.

14:57.552 --> 14:59.305
Just bought her flowers,
that sort of thing.

15:04.810 --> 15:08.063
This chap, would I know him?

15:08.147 --> 15:10.732
Well, it's not beyond
the realms of possibility, no.

15:13.652 --> 15:18.324
Anyway, he's asking himself
is he too old to be
considering a relationship?

15:22.327 --> 15:24.037
And how would you advise him?

15:26.624 --> 15:28.960
Well, I think
I'll be telling him,

15:31.336 --> 15:34.214
I think I'll be telling him
that it is never too late.

15:36.842 --> 15:38.677
What would you say?

15:38.761 --> 15:41.388
I agree. Absolutely.

15:41.930 --> 15:43.056
Good.

15:44.392 --> 15:45.518
Good.

15:46.060 --> 15:47.103
Excellent.

(GROWLING)

16:41.364 --> 16:42.366
Hey!

16:45.495 --> 16:47.621
-Found yourself
a new friend, then.
-Eh?

16:47.705 --> 16:50.207
-Young girl.
-Oh, Heather.

16:50.290 --> 16:52.251
Oh, first name terms already.

16:52.335 --> 16:54.794
I was just being chatty.

16:54.878 --> 16:57.131
Oh, really?

16:57.215 --> 16:58.799
She's from the campsite.

16:58.883 --> 17:00.842
Well, perhaps you
might like to introduce me.

17:00.926 --> 17:02.677
(STAMMERS)

17:02.762 --> 17:05.556
Perhaps that wouldn't be
a great idea, probably.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.098
You wouldn't have
anything to hide, would you?

17:08.183 --> 17:09.768
How are the naturalists?
Have they settled in
all right?

17:09.851 --> 17:13.021
Yeah, he made sure
they got a very warm welcome.

17:13.104 --> 17:14.814
Well, one of them anyway.

17:17.234 --> 17:19.778
Actually,
there are a couple of things
we should talk about.

17:21.113 --> 17:22.906
They haven't got any
complaints, have they?

17:22.989 --> 17:25.282
Them? No,
everything's perfect for them.

17:25.367 --> 17:26.535
That's all that matters,
isn't it?

17:26.618 --> 17:30.122
Exactly. Apart from...

17:30.205 --> 17:33.542
Whatever you're doing stop it,
this is more important.
Come on.

17:38.630 --> 17:40.298
ARCHIE: That's impossible,
one can't have got out.

17:40.382 --> 17:41.925
I only know what I saw.

17:42.008 --> 17:43.552
Maybe it was a dog.

17:43.635 --> 17:45.302
Maybe, but it must have been
a pretty big one.

17:48.139 --> 17:50.851
Look, you've been in there
today, so the enclosure
must have been opened.

17:50.934 --> 17:54.063
-Yeah.
-Well,
did you lock it properly?

17:54.145 --> 17:57.275
Yeah, course I did.
Well, actually,
I left Golly and Duncan.

18:00.985 --> 18:04.448
Golly, you know
how some people

18:04.532 --> 18:10.996
get on with certain people
better than other people?

18:11.079 --> 18:14.958
And would these be any
people in particular?

18:15.042 --> 18:17.920
Well, Irene for example.

18:18.004 --> 18:21.047
-Irene and...
-And?

18:21.132 --> 18:23.633
-And...
-Another person?

18:23.717 --> 18:27.305
-Exactly.
-Why don't you just
come out and say it?

18:27.388 --> 18:29.973
Well, yes, but the thing is...

18:30.057 --> 18:33.226
You think I should say
something to her.

18:33.310 --> 18:34.604
-Yes.
-Yes.

18:34.687 --> 18:36.521
-No.
-No.

18:36.605 --> 18:39.108
-No.
-ARCHIE: I thought I
could trust you two!

18:39.191 --> 18:40.942
What do you mean?

18:41.026 --> 18:42.904
It looks like one of
the wolves has escaped
from the enclosure.

18:44.113 --> 18:45.781
That'll be my fault.

18:45.864 --> 18:47.992
I left both of you
to take care of it.

18:48.074 --> 18:51.913
There's no need to go blaming
Duncan. I had to go back
inside. I'm sorry, Archie.

18:51.995 --> 18:55.249
It's a bit late for that.
We could well have
a situation on our hands.

18:55.332 --> 18:56.918
Are you sure one
of them is missing?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.461
Does anybody know why these
are all over the lawn?

18:59.545 --> 19:01.671
I think that
answers your question.

19:01.756 --> 19:05.092
Look, there's no good in going
after it now, we'll lose
the light in half an hour.

19:05.176 --> 19:07.177
We'd have no chance.

19:07.261 --> 19:09.597
All right, first light, then.
Let's just hope
it's not too late.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.556
But that means it'll
be out there all night.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.725
Well, just make sure
you're not.

19:13.808 --> 19:16.395
We'll have to evacuate the
naturalists' camp. I'll go and
have a word with them.

19:16.478 --> 19:18.606
What are you
going to say to them?

19:18.688 --> 19:22.192
I don't know. Poachers.
We've got a band of poachers,
armed and dangerous.

19:22.276 --> 19:24.529
No, I'll do it.

19:24.612 --> 19:28.032
After all, like you said,
they're my responsibility.

19:39.126 --> 19:41.963
-Dunc,
we'll get this wolf back.
-It'll be too late by then.

19:42.045 --> 19:46.007
Everything's going wrong, Lex,
and they were my big chance.

19:46.091 --> 19:48.134
-Who?
-The naturalists.

19:48.218 --> 19:51.513
Only they're not
naturalists because,
well, they're something else.

19:51.596 --> 19:53.348
And on top of that,
I haven't told Golly yet.

19:53.432 --> 19:56.476
Told Golly what?

19:56.560 --> 19:59.605
If I tell you and
you tell somebody else,
I'd have to kill you.

20:02.065 --> 20:04.694
Oh, so it's really
serious then, eh?

20:05.443 --> 20:07.612
I'm seeing someone.

20:07.696 --> 20:09.657
Aw, well, that's good, Duncan.

20:09.740 --> 20:11.199
It's Irene.

20:11.284 --> 20:14.245
Oh, not so good.
Well, you do know how
Golly feels about her?

20:17.456 --> 20:19.875
Oh, and I've been
encouraging him.

20:19.958 --> 20:22.920
-What am I gonna do?
-Well, you need to talk
to him.

20:23.004 --> 20:25.798
-I've tried.
-Try a bit harder.

20:27.592 --> 20:30.385
Aye, but I've got to see
these naturalists first.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.482

20:46.360 --> 20:47.652
Can I help you?

(BIRD SCREECHING)

21:19.392 --> 21:21.395
Duncan, what are
you doing behind here?

21:25.316 --> 21:28.152
I just heard a noise,
checking it out.

21:28.235 --> 21:29.569
Not hiding?

21:30.654 --> 21:32.864
Why would I be?

21:32.948 --> 21:35.243
So I don't catch
you sneaking down
to see your little girlfriend.

21:35.326 --> 21:36.618
She's not my...

21:37.453 --> 21:39.330
You are.

21:39.412 --> 21:42.874
And you wouldn't keep anything
from me, would you?

21:42.958 --> 21:44.543
Like what?

21:44.626 --> 21:47.295
Like the fact that
they're prancing around
without any clothes on.

21:47.379 --> 21:49.047
I've just been down there.

21:49.131 --> 21:52.133
You don't suppose
we can just keep that
between the two of us, do you?

21:52.217 --> 21:55.470
-You think no one
else is gonna notice?
-No one else is gonna know!

21:55.554 --> 21:57.682
I'm on my way down there
to tell them to leave now.

21:57.764 --> 22:00.226
Why?

22:00.309 --> 22:02.562
Because there's a gang
of poachers on the loose.

22:02.645 --> 22:03.812
Oh, you're kidding.

22:03.895 --> 22:05.940
Yeah, I am.
It's a wolf really.

22:17.451 --> 22:19.494
-Evening, Duncan.
-Hi, Ian.

22:20.745 --> 22:23.791
Do you not recognise
me with my clothes on?

22:23.874 --> 22:27.128
It's a bit chilly
to be wandering about
without them, even for me.

22:27.210 --> 22:28.962
But tomorrow's another day,
eh?

22:29.045 --> 22:33.092
Ah, well,
that's just, not for you.

22:33.176 --> 22:34.343
I don't suppose you
could translate that for me?

22:35.510 --> 22:39.182
You've got to go.

22:39.265 --> 22:43.894
Oh, I know what this is, it's
victimisation. You think we
might lower the tone, do you?

22:43.977 --> 22:47.607
-No, no, it's not that.
-Yes, it is.

22:47.690 --> 22:50.818
We've been thrown off sites
before and I promised myself
it wouldn't happen again.

22:50.902 --> 22:54.405
-We're not going anywhere.
-Please, just listen, it's...

22:56.781 --> 22:59.368
We think there might be
poachers on the estate.

23:00.870 --> 23:03.789
Oh, I see. Well,
it's your lucky day, then.

23:05.291 --> 23:07.585

23:38.490 --> 23:41.243
So we start the search, say,
within a mile of the house?

23:41.326 --> 23:42.911
Yeah, that should do it.

from there.

23:57.051 --> 23:59.052
Ta.

23:59.135 --> 24:01.472
Well, as long as you've got
your wits about you
this morning.

24:01.556 --> 24:05.308
We can't open the place but
at least we know we're the
only ones on the estate.

24:05.393 --> 24:08.937
Ah, I was going to
talk to you about that.

24:09.020 --> 24:11.356
You did tell the naturalists
they had to leave?

24:11.439 --> 24:14.360
-Oh, aye, absolutely.
-Good.

24:14.443 --> 24:17.238
The only thing is,
they wouldn't listen.

24:18.488 --> 24:19.866
So they're still here?

24:23.244 --> 24:26.872
There is something else
perhaps you ought to know.

24:28.456 --> 24:29.541
Yes?

24:34.212 --> 24:36.507
What's going on in there?

24:36.591 --> 24:39.176
It looks like Duncan's
got his wires crossed again.

24:40.469 --> 24:43.680
Ah, well,
he might not be the only one.

24:43.764 --> 24:45.849
What do you mean?

24:45.933 --> 24:51.813
Well, you know, I just don't
think you should push it,
you know, with Irene.

24:51.897 --> 24:55.233
-Do you think I'm gonna
make a fool of myself?
-Oh, no, no, it's not that.

24:55.317 --> 24:57.612
What changed your mind?

24:57.695 --> 24:59.489
It's just that
we don't know her very well,

24:59.571 --> 25:02.700
and I wouldn't want you
getting hurt on account of
something I've said.

25:02.783 --> 25:07.037
Thanks for your concern,
Lexie, but I think I'm old
enough to look after myself.

25:10.665 --> 25:12.042
Great.

25:24.889 --> 25:27.974
-Spotted anything?
-Yes, unfortunately.

KILWILLIE: Morning, Archie.

25:35.315 --> 25:40.862
I Hope you haven't had
breakfast. Trout, fresh from
the Kilwillie smokery.

25:40.946 --> 25:44.367
No time I'm afraid, Kilwillie,
bit of a crisis on.

25:44.450 --> 25:46.493
Well, I did rather wonder.
What's going on?

25:46.577 --> 25:48.745
We've got a runaway.

25:48.830 --> 25:51.624
Archie! Archie, I've seen it.
The wolf.

25:53.083 --> 25:57.839
-Where?
-It's just
outside the enclosure.

25:57.922 --> 26:02.301
Wild animal to recapture.
Don't worry, Archie, Kilwillie
will give you a hand.

26:03.970 --> 26:05.387
Well, of course I'd love to,

26:05.471 --> 26:06.764
but I've got
a rather important
business appointment.

26:08.223 --> 26:10.433
Kilwillie, we need
all the help we can get.

26:10.518 --> 26:15.523
And I would consider
it a personal favour
if you would volunteer.

26:15.606 --> 26:19.776
Well, in that case,
I'd be delighted to
offer my services.

26:19.860 --> 26:21.361
Duncan!

26:23.322 --> 26:24.823
Oh, no, it's him.

26:24.906 --> 26:26.200
-Who?
-Ian.

26:29.161 --> 26:30.871
But he's dressed.

26:30.954 --> 26:33.374
Yeah, well, you know, they
don't always do it with...

26:35.126 --> 26:37.043
The man that runs this show.
I want to see him.

26:43.426 --> 26:45.302
That's me.

26:45.385 --> 26:49.264
Good. Because I thought
we'd found quite
a little paradise,

26:49.347 --> 26:51.600
but judging by your man Duncan
here's attempt at eviction,

26:51.684 --> 26:55.688
it seems you're just as
prejudiced as the rest of
the so-called moral majority.

26:55.770 --> 27:00.942
Sounds like a public relations
matter to me, Ian, and that's
very much my department.

27:01.026 --> 27:03.321
Duncan, come on.

27:03.404 --> 27:06.324
-I may call you Ian, mayn't I?
-Well, it is my name.

27:06.406 --> 27:10.119
Suits you. Strong, manly.

27:10.203 --> 27:12.330
You don't have to come with us
if you don't want to.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.372
A Kilwillie's
word is his bond.

27:14.457 --> 27:17.167
I know my mother sometimes
likes to take advantage.

27:17.251 --> 27:19.711
Nonsense.
Glad to be of service.

27:19.794 --> 27:24.883
I often wish I'd
been called Marilyn.
So exotic, don't you think?

27:24.966 --> 27:29.721
-Where are we going?
-Tea, scones and
a good old chinwag.

27:36.478 --> 27:39.898
Tranquilliser guns. There are
still people on the estate so
speed is what really matters.

27:42.944 --> 27:45.613
Nothing the matter is there,
Golly? We've practised
this often enough.

27:45.696 --> 27:48.533
-It would be quicker and
cleaner to shoot to kill.
-No.

27:48.615 --> 27:51.618
GOLLY: And less dangerous.
We don't know how it's going
to react to being darted.

27:51.702 --> 27:53.579
It'll be unconscious
in no time.

27:53.662 --> 27:56.623
When a frightened animal is
cornered there's no telling
what might happen.

27:56.707 --> 27:59.710
They do everything they can
to avoid contact with people.

27:59.793 --> 28:03.589
-Oh, I do hope so.
-GOLLY: That's just
textbook stuff.

28:03.672 --> 28:06.717
Now it's got a taste of the
pheasant, who knows how
many it's gonna take.

28:06.801 --> 28:08.844
So, knocking it out
solves the problem
just as well.

28:08.928 --> 28:11.848
It wouldn't
have been a problem
if we'd stuck to what we know.

28:11.931 --> 28:14.349
The wolves have been a mistake
right from the beginning.

28:14.432 --> 28:16.227
If my memory
serves me correctly,

28:16.310 --> 28:19.021
the mistake was made by the
person who let one out
in the first place.

28:19.105 --> 28:20.564
Och, come on, that's not fair.

28:20.648 --> 28:22.859
It was my fault a wee bit too,
I should have stayed with him.

28:22.942 --> 28:25.236
Maybe you should have done,
but it doesn't help us
much now, does it?

28:25.318 --> 28:28.238
-DUNCAN: No, but...
-Have you heard yourselves?

28:28.321 --> 28:32.242
This doesn't solve anything,
just go and get the job done.

28:34.369 --> 28:35.370
She's right.

28:36.873 --> 28:39.083
Well, I'm ready.

28:39.167 --> 28:41.878
Are you feeling lucky,
wolf, well, are ya?

28:41.961 --> 28:45.046
Let's just remember,
this is a wild animal
we're dealing with.

28:45.131 --> 28:47.716
We've all seen what
wolves do to their prey.

28:47.799 --> 28:50.845
They always go for the soft,
vulnerable bits, Duncan.

28:50.927 --> 28:52.889
So watch the wind
doesn't blow your kilt up.

29:06.026 --> 29:08.029
More tea?

29:08.112 --> 29:12.325
No offence, but when
the sun's shining I don't
like to be sitting indoors.

29:12.408 --> 29:15.161
So why don't we go and see
if we can't find
that son of yours?

29:15.244 --> 29:21.166
Please, as I said,
any grievances you have,
you can air them with me.

29:21.250 --> 29:25.003
-I want to speak to
the organ grinder, not his...
-Monkey?

29:25.086 --> 29:27.047
Now,
I was going to say mother.

29:34.722 --> 29:37.098
DUNCAN: There's Carlin.

29:37.182 --> 29:40.353
Yep. It shouldn't be
too difficult at all.

29:40.435 --> 29:45.733
I reckon all it takes is for
one of us to nip down there
and let her back in.

29:45.816 --> 29:49.111
-It's safer to be sure.
-That gets my vote.

29:49.195 --> 29:51.780
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, Duncan might be right.

29:51.864 --> 29:53.740
(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

29:57.327 --> 29:59.412
-Brilliant.
-Come on.

30:11.425 --> 30:14.637
Hey, hey, no need to panic.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.389
So what are the guns for?

30:16.472 --> 30:17.848
We're on the trail
of an escaped wolf.

30:17.932 --> 30:20.684
(HEATHER SCREAMS)

30:20.768 --> 30:23.270
Well, thank you very much,
Duncan.
That's just what we needed.

30:34.573 --> 30:38.703
This whole wolf hunt thing,
it's a training exercise.

30:38.785 --> 30:42.122
-I just thought we
ought to let you know that.
-Thanks.

30:42.205 --> 30:43.999
But if you'd feel
better away from the place,

30:44.083 --> 30:46.335
then we'd be happy to refund
your camping fees, of course.

30:46.419 --> 30:49.172
-I don't think
that'll be necessary.
-Why not?

30:49.255 --> 30:51.966
Well, it's not as if
we're in any danger, is it?

30:54.802 --> 30:58.513
Bit of a slippery customer,
your boy, isn't he?
Difficult to pin down.

30:58.598 --> 31:02.602
Archie's a very busy man.
He always has something on.

31:02.684 --> 31:05.938
Aye, well, that's as may be,
but there's no excuse
for poor service, eh?

31:06.021 --> 31:07.147
The customer's always right.

31:07.230 --> 31:09.734
Oh, of course.
Why don't I show you around?

31:11.276 --> 31:15.614
Ah, Lexie! This is Ian,
you know, from the campsite.

31:15.697 --> 31:17.824
He's looking for Archie.
You haven't seen him,
have you?

31:18.659 --> 31:19.660
Uh.

31:21.620 --> 31:24.749
No, no, not for a while.

31:24.832 --> 31:27.334
I mean, he's probably half way
up that mountain or something
by now.

31:27.417 --> 31:30.922
Um, why don't you stay here?
You know, wait for him
till he gets back.

31:31.005 --> 31:33.049
What a splendid idea.

31:33.132 --> 31:36.594
Aye, if you don't mind,
Mrs MacDonald, I think
I'll just got after him.

31:36.676 --> 31:42.016
Then why don't I show you
what Glenbogle has to offer
on the way? Come on!

31:42.099 --> 31:45.143
-Right.
-Now, this is...

32:08.416 --> 32:09.417
Duncan!

32:12.046 --> 32:15.799
-Where have you been?
-To fetch this.

32:15.883 --> 32:18.678
-You're not gonna
use it, are you?
-It will be better this way.

32:19.303 --> 32:20.513
Come on.

32:27.186 --> 32:29.688
-I wish I'd brought
my sandwiches.
-Focus, Duncan.

32:29.772 --> 32:31.815
I'm hungry.

32:31.898 --> 32:34.442
No doubt Irene will have
something hot waiting
for us when we get back.

32:34.526 --> 32:36.945
Now you come to
mention it, Golly,
I meant to say...

32:37.029 --> 32:39.949
-Don't say a word.
-No, sorry, but I've got to.

32:40.031 --> 32:41.283
Shut up.

32:46.664 --> 32:47.873
(GUN FIRES)

32:53.962 --> 32:55.839
You missed. What happened?

32:57.675 --> 33:00.970
The sight must have
taken a knock or something.

33:01.053 --> 33:02.054
I thought I said
tranquilisers only!

33:03.890 --> 33:06.349
Don't worry, Arch, he missed.

33:06.434 --> 33:09.979
That's the whole point,
isn't it? You're putting
other people in danger.

33:12.148 --> 33:15.026
I'm not gonna say this again.
You'll either do it my way
or not at all.

33:15.859 --> 33:16.985
Okay.

33:20.322 --> 33:23.408
But if it's my fault she's on
the loose, then it's up to
me to get her back.

33:24.034 --> 33:25.495
Right.

33:26.912 --> 33:30.041
-Which way did she go?
-Through the trees.

33:30.123 --> 33:32.542
Okay,
Duncan, you circle round,
I'll take the other side.

33:32.627 --> 33:36.755
-Golly, you make a slow
approach with Kilwillie.
-Wilco.

33:36.838 --> 33:38.716
I would be better
on my own, Archie.

33:38.799 --> 33:42.344
No. You can keep
an eye on each other.

33:55.690 --> 33:57.276
Everyone's nervous
the first time.

33:57.359 --> 34:01.404
It's a strange
attitude we have
to nakedness in this country.

34:01.489 --> 34:05.283
-But once you've tried it...
-You'll never look back.

34:05.367 --> 34:07.869
Why don't you
come down to the camp
and meet the others?

34:07.953 --> 34:09.956
I mean, who knows,
you might even get the urge.

34:10.039 --> 34:11.748
It's a bit close to home
for me.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.377
Not so sure your boy
would approve?

34:16.335 --> 34:18.339
My daughter's the same.

34:18.422 --> 34:21.882
See, where we live,
no one knows.

34:21.967 --> 34:25.344
Heather would be mortified
if we were the talk
of the town.

34:25.429 --> 34:29.433
She has enough to put up with,
with me being in the police.

34:29.516 --> 34:33.520
-So what do your
colleagues think?
-I haven't told them either.

34:33.603 --> 34:37.482
You can imagine the jokes,
can't you? So where do you
keep your truncheon?

34:37.565 --> 34:39.318
You're very wise.

34:42.571 --> 34:45.616
-This way, I think.
-Wait a minute.

34:45.699 --> 34:48.659
-Have you seen
what I've just seen?
-No, no, what is it?

34:48.743 --> 34:50.621
Now, let's not play games.

34:57.170 --> 34:58.296
This.

34:59.838 --> 35:03.091
Broken glass and
bare feet don't mix.

35:03.175 --> 35:08.096
Safety, safety, safety.
It's the first rule
of a naturist's bible.

35:08.180 --> 35:10.516
And I'm a stickler for
what's right and proper.

35:10.600 --> 35:14.644
It doesn't always make me
popular, but somebody has
to make a stand.

35:16.147 --> 35:18.190
Thank goodness you were there.

35:18.274 --> 35:20.693
-I hadn't even noticed it.
-You've got to keep
your wits about you.

35:20.775 --> 35:23.946
It's all part of the training.
There's not much gets past me.

35:26.865 --> 35:30.452
We'll have to find a wee bin
to put this in and put notices
up, Mrs MacDonald.

35:30.536 --> 35:34.747
We don't want glass
left anywhere around.
It's very, very dangerous.

funny, do you? You could have
given me a heart attack.

Oh, get away with you.
Here, I think these are yours.

36:01.942 --> 36:05.237
No prizes for guessing
what you were up to, then.

36:05.320 --> 36:09.324
-Looking for Carlin.
-Or having a little
squint down at the naturists.

36:09.408 --> 36:12.619
-See if you can catch
that girl with her kit off.
-I was not.

36:12.702 --> 36:15.831
-If you say so.
-Aye, I do.

36:15.913 --> 36:20.169
I'm surprised you're
not down there with her,
getting a bit of sunshine.

36:20.252 --> 36:24.549
Or are you one of those who
goes all red and blotchy
when you expose yourself?

we're known for it.

36:28.302 --> 36:29.554

36:47.195 --> 36:53.827

hill, a sighting is more
likely from the top.

36:53.911 --> 36:56.371
Yeah. Good idea, old boy.

Why don't I take
a look over there?

I was gonna tell you, I tried,
but I knew how hurt you'd be.

37:47.255 --> 37:51.134
I didn't do it deliberately.
Irene and me just
sort of happened.

37:51.219 --> 37:54.639
Please, Golly,
I'm really sorry.

37:57.391 --> 37:59.351
We've still got
a wolf to catch.

more comfortable
speaking to my wife.

Oh, I'd really
rather not bother her.

Mrs MacDonald,
I don't think you're
interested in naturism at all.

38:15.326 --> 38:17.954
This is some sort
of wild goose chase
you've got me on.

38:18.037 --> 38:20.873
Well, I am not gonna let
you waste any more of my time.

38:20.956 --> 38:22.082
Ian!

38:25.043 --> 38:27.671
-Did you find her?
-No.

38:27.754 --> 38:29.506
Then you'd better be quick

38:29.590 --> 38:31.550
because if he gets
so much as a whiff
of what's really going on!

38:31.633 --> 38:33.553
Perhaps if we didn't have
Kilwillie holding us up.

38:33.636 --> 38:36.596
-You really shouldn't
encourage him, Mother.
-Why ever not?

38:36.680 --> 38:40.142
Because if you keep on giving
him reasons to stay, then
he'll be here all the time.

-Not that he isn't anyway.
-He's a very dear, old friend.

38:42.644 --> 38:46.147

he has an open invitation.

to run, you've got Lexie,

Glenbogle safe again.

-Where have you been?

39:09.504 --> 39:12.425
-Sidetracked.
-Eh?

39:12.508 --> 39:14.885
Have you ever had the feeling
you're missing something?

39:14.968 --> 39:17.846
That it's happening
right under your nose,
but you just can't see it.

You're imagining things.

is not to panic.

39:32.736 --> 39:34.697

You were the ones that wanted
to get back to nature.

just let Golly catch you?

Of course not! We didn't mean
it to happen, we were just
having a laugh, that's all.

-He could do with some
practice, but not bad.

-Or I could have.

a wedge through them?

since I don't know when

47:32.174 --> 47:35.427
I know a man of integrity,
such as yourself,
can cope with that.

47:35.510 --> 47:40.766
-Of course.
-But think of Heather,
the embarrassment for her.

47:40.850 --> 47:44.394
We both have children
who'll be affected
if this comes out.

47:44.477 --> 47:46.563
But what if this
was to happen again?

47:46.646 --> 47:48.983
I think we've learnt
our lesson.

47:54.197 --> 47:55.405
Our two heroes,
you were so brave.

47:58.158 --> 48:00.244
Are you sure Ian won't say
anything to anyone?

48:00.328 --> 48:04.207
Oh, he gave me his word,
and I believe him.

48:04.289 --> 48:06.792
Carlin seems happier
now she's back with the pack.

48:06.876 --> 48:09.754
LEXIE: So all's well
that ends well, eh?

48:10.713 --> 48:13.215
It's not though, is it?

48:13.298 --> 48:16.218
Somebody could have
got badly hurt today
because of me.

48:16.302 --> 48:19.597
That fella was right
to be angry. We were lucky
to get off so lightly.

48:19.680 --> 48:22.766
Well, in future, we'll
be taking no more chances.

48:22.849 --> 48:24.268
Are we getting rid
of the wolves?

48:24.351 --> 48:26.354
No, I'm sending you
on a course.

48:26.437 --> 48:28.523
What sort of course?

48:28.606 --> 48:32.067
Just to brush up
your basic skills.

48:32.150 --> 48:35.487
Look, if you don't mind me
saying so, even your
numeracy is questionable,

48:35.570 --> 48:38.658
judging by those
figures you did for the feed.

48:38.740 --> 48:41.243
-What's numeracy?
-Adding up.

48:41.327 --> 48:45.121
-Surely you don't
mean that, Archie?
-Yes, I do.

48:45.206 --> 48:46.581
If I'm going to run
this estate properly

48:46.665 --> 48:48.834
then I need to make sure
that I can rely on everybody.

48:48.917 --> 48:51.504
Well,
I would hate to be a drain
on your resources, Archie.

48:53.548 --> 48:57.552
So you just keep your money,
I don't need a course.

48:57.635 --> 49:01.472
It's not my mind
that is feeble,
it's my eyesight.

49:01.555 --> 49:05.433
And that's why I didn't lock
the enclosure properly,
that's why I missed my shot

49:05.517 --> 49:09.146
and that is why
I can't do my sums.

49:10.773 --> 49:13.441
-So you need glasses?
-It's not that simple.

49:13.526 --> 49:15.903
Of course it is,
I wear them myself.

49:15.987 --> 49:20.741
Molly,
I've got this rare condition,
it runs in my family.

49:20.825 --> 49:24.619
My father was complaining
about it just before he had
his heart attack.

49:24.704 --> 49:26.330
By the end, you can
barely see at all.

49:27.873 --> 49:29.916
I suppose you could
say he was spared.

49:35.423 --> 49:37.841
So, Archie,

49:37.924 --> 49:41.261
you can consider my
resignation tendered.

49:43.430 --> 49:45.599
I'll not be a burden
to you any more.

49:50.061 --> 49:52.355
-Golly!
-Archie.

49:56.234 --> 49:59.197
You should stay as well.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.697
Well, no one's stopping me.

50:16.838 --> 50:19.175
Golly,
there's no need for this.

50:20.759 --> 50:23.345
I can't see any other way.

50:23.428 --> 50:26.557
Glenbogle's your home.
All your friends are here.

50:27.600 --> 50:30.853
Friends?
Is that what they are?

50:30.937 --> 50:36.067
Then how can they treat me
like this? Every one of them.
Archie, Duncan, Irene.

50:37.442 --> 50:38.736
Even you.

50:40.654 --> 50:44.742
-Oh, don't say that.
-Come on, Lex, it's the truth.

50:44.826 --> 50:46.494
You knew about those two
all along.

50:48.246 --> 50:49.914
That's what you were
trying to tell me earlier.

50:51.499 --> 50:53.084
You're not really leaving.

50:57.505 --> 50:58.631
Here.

51:04.678 --> 51:08.266
Give this to Archie for me.
I've no further use for it.

51:10.559 --> 51:14.104
Golly, please, not like this.

51:15.730 --> 51:17.232
My mind's made up.

51:30.371 --> 51:31.872
I hope you're happy.

51:33.166 --> 51:34.876
I'm sorry, I really am.

52:47.906 --> 52:49.909
I was just wondering
how many it would be
for dinner.

52:51.910 --> 52:53.036
Four.

52:54.914 --> 52:56.707
Lord Kilwillie
won't be eating, then?

52:58.417 --> 52:59.418
BOTH: Kilwillie!

53:04.714 --> 53:06.676
(SNORING)
