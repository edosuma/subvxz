Are you staying
or are you going to go?

38:23.000 --> 38:24.790
-Yeah, y'all need help.
-Absolutely we do.

38:24.790 --> 38:26.500
GRACE: Oh, look, this gotta go.

38:28.790 --> 38:30.210
Hey.
Thought you'd be asleep.

38:30.210 --> 38:32.790
I'm not tired.

38:34.210 --> 38:36.800
Is something wrong?

38:38.790 --> 38:40.000
When I was
in your office today,

38:40.000 --> 38:41.250
I was looking for some gum,

38:41.250 --> 38:43.460
and I found a pill bottle
instea

38:43.460 --> 38:45.130
d.

38:45.130 --> 38:47.420
Granisetron.

38:48.630 --> 38:50.920
At least I think
that's how you pronounce it.

38:52.460 --> 38:53.960
I looked it up,
and it's anti-nausea meds

38:53.960 --> 38:57.000
for chemo patients.

38:58.790 --> 39:01.340
The cough...it's lung cancer,
right?

39:01.880 --> 39:05.340
(keys jingling)

39:05.340 --> 39:07.840
I was gonna tell you.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.420
Sure you were.
(scoffs)

39:09.420 --> 39:11.790
How long have you known?

39:11.790 --> 39:13.670
(exhales deeply)

39:13.670 --> 39:15.130
-Since before we left New York.
-Wow.

39:18.420 --> 39:19.960
Wow, you must think
I'm so weak.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.920
(scoffs)

39:21.920 --> 39:23.550
OWEN: No.

39:23.550 --> 39:25.460
<i>(soft music)</i>

39:25.460 --> 39:27.670
Admit it.

39:28.790 --> 39:30.210
You didn't think
that I could handle it.

39:30.210 --> 39:31.710
No, it's not that at all.

39:31.710 --> 39:33.380
You thought that fragile TK
would spin out and OD again?

39:33.380 --> 39:35.790
That's what you thought, right?

39:35.790 --> 39:37.550
-It's not like that at all.
-Then why would you lie to me

39:37.550 --> 39:38.790
every single minute
of every day?

39:38.790 --> 39:40.250
The reason I didn't
tell you about my diagnosis is

39:40.250 --> 39:42.170
not because I think
you're weak.

39:43.790 --> 39:45.790
It's because I am.
