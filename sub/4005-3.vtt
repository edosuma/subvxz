12:47.750 --> 12:49.667
HEY, I HATE TO TROUBLE YOU,

12:49.667 --> 12:51.291
BUT THAT COFFEE
REALLY LOOKS GOOD.

12:51.291 --> 12:52.583
I WAS GONNA GET SOME EARLIER.

12:52.583 --> 12:54.709
I FEEL A CAFFEINE HEADACHE
COMING ON.

12:54.709 --> 12:56.417
- I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

12:56.417 --> 12:57.250
I'LL FETCH YOU A MUG.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.417
BE RIGHT BACK.

12:58.417 --> 13:00.625
- I APPRECIATE IT.

13:10.583 --> 13:13.333
ONE WOMAN...
ANOTHER IN A WHEELCHAIR.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.458
THAT LEAVES...

13:15.458 --> 13:16.875
WALTER KENNEY.

13:16.875 --> 13:19.875
MOVED HERE FROM GRANTS PASS,
OREGON, FIVE YEARS AGO.

13:19.875 --> 13:23.750
HOW ARE YOU SPENDING
YOUR SECOND CHILDHOOD?

13:27.875 --> 13:29.417
- WHAT'S THAT?

13:29.417 --> 13:31.041
- OH, YOU'VE BEEN DOING
SUCH A GOOD JOB,

13:31.041 --> 13:33.959
I PUT TOGETHER A LITTLE SURPRISE
FOR YOUR VIEWING PLEASURE.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.750
- IS THIS WHAT I THINK IT IS?

13:35.750 --> 13:38.041
- EVIDENCE FROM THE ICE TRUCK
KILLER INVESTIGATION.

13:38.041 --> 13:40.458
YOU SAID IN CLASS HOW
YOU WERE REALLY INTO THIS CASE.

13:40.458 --> 13:42.083
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

13:42.083 --> 13:43.917
I WAS OBSESSED WITH THIS CASE.

13:43.917 --> 13:46.458
I HAVE FOLLOWED IT
NIGHT AND DAY.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.583
THIS IS REALLY SWEET.

13:52.792 --> 13:56.041
- THIS IS THE ICE TRUCK KILLER'S
HOSPITAL I.D.

14:00.375 --> 14:02.500
AND THE HOLY OF HOLIES.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.625
- OH, WOW.

14:09.375 --> 14:12.083
WHOA.

14:12.083 --> 14:15.000
YOU KNOW...

14:15.000 --> 14:17.041
WHEN THE DETAILS OF THIS CASE
WERE MADE PUBLIC,

14:17.041 --> 14:20.125
I PAINTED MY NAILS LIKE THIS
FOR A WHOLE WEEK.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.333
IS THAT JUST WRONG?

14:22.333 --> 14:24.125
- IS IT WRONG
THAT IT MAKES ME HOT?

14:24.125 --> 14:26.625
[both giggle]

14:26.625 --> 14:29.500
- UH...WHAT DO THEY DO
WITH ALL THIS STUFF?

14:29.500 --> 14:32.667
- IT JUST SITS HERE
IN EVIDENCE...FOREVER.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.834
- THAT'S A SHAME.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.667
I MEAN, THIS IS A PIECE
OF HISTORY.

14:39.375 --> 14:43.250
- IT'S TIME FOR THE BRIEFING.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.875
[elevator bell rings]

14:44.875 --> 14:47.041
- OH, THERE YOU ARE.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.834
I'VE SAT THROUGH GOD KNOWS
HOW MANY BRIEFINGS.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.417
WHY AM I SO FUCKING NERVOUS?

14:51.417 --> 14:52.667
- BECAUSE EVERYONE WILL BE
LOOKING TO SEE

14:52.667 --> 14:54.417
IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

14:54.417 --> 14:55.709
- DO ME A FAVOR.

14:55.709 --> 14:56.625
WHEN YOU GET BACK TO YOUR DESK,

14:56.625 --> 14:58.500
LOOK UP THE WORD "RHETORICAL."

14:58.500 --> 15:00.750
- YOU'LL BE FINE, DEB.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.208
- OKAY, EVERYONE,
WE'VE GOT A LOT TO COVER,

15:02.208 --> 15:04.208
SO LET'S GET STARTED.

15:04.208 --> 15:06.709
FIRST UP IS THE HOMICIDE
ON EUCLID.

15:06.709 --> 15:08.375
WHERE ARE WE ON IDENTIFYING
THE VICTIM?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.208
- HER FINGERPRINTS
GAVE US A NAME.

15:10.208 --> 15:11.875
ROSALIA DAVOLOS.

15:11.875 --> 15:14.375
SEVERAL PRIORS
FOR SOLICITATION.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.041
WE TALKED TO A LOCAL MERCHANT.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.792
IT SEEMS THAT STRIP
WAS PRACTICALLY HER OFFICE.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.041
- DID WE RUN HER CELL PHONE?

15:19.041 --> 15:20.542
- THAT TURNED UP
A LONG LIST OF NUMBERS.

15:20.542 --> 15:21.875
MOSTLY JOHNS.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.375
UH, WE'RE WORKING THROUGH
THE NAMES NOW.

15:23.375 --> 15:24.917
- WHAT ABOUT A TOX SCREEN?

15:24.917 --> 15:28.291
- TRACE AMOUNTS OF COCAINE
IN HER SYSTEM AND...

15:28.291 --> 15:30.125
DOUGHNUTS.

15:30.125 --> 15:31.417
[laughter]

15:31.417 --> 15:33.625
- LET'S, UH, CHECK THE AREA
FOR KNOWN PUSHERS.

15:33.625 --> 15:35.500
MAYBE SHE GOT CAUGHT UP
IN A BAD DEAL

15:35.500 --> 15:37.000
OR SHE GOT BEHIND
ON A PAYMENT.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.291
I'M HOPING FIVE
OR SIX PEOPLE WILL VOLUNTEER--

15:39.291 --> 15:41.166
- THEY'LL NEVER TIE THIS
TO A QUARTER-CENTURY-OLD

15:41.166 --> 15:44.041
SERIAL KILLER CASE
FROM OREGON.

15:44.041 --> 15:47.083
NOT SURE I HAVE EITHER,
BUT I CAN DREAM.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.542
- THAT TAKES US
TO THE SNAKES KILLING.

15:49.542 --> 15:52.417
IT'S LOOKING LIKE THIS WASN'T
A DRUG CARTEL HIT AFTER ALL.

15:52.417 --> 15:53.750
- AS MUCH AS I HATE
TO ADMIT IT,

15:53.750 --> 15:55.583
MAYBE BROTHER SAM WAS RIGHT
ABOUT OUR VICTIM.

15:55.583 --> 15:58.000
MAYBE HE CLEANED UP HIS ACT.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.792
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE WASN'T
SOMEONE OUT THERE

15:59.792 --> 16:01.792
LOOKING TO SETTLE AN OLD SCORE.

16:01.792 --> 16:03.959
- WHAT IF WE MADE SOME OF
THE DETAILS OF THE CASE PUBLIC,

16:03.959 --> 16:05.291
LIKE THE SNAKES?

16:05.291 --> 16:11.291
MIGHT SCARE UP A LEAD.

16:11.291 --> 16:12.875
- UH, NO.

16:12.875 --> 16:15.375
THAT MAY COMPROMISE THE CASE
WHEN IT GOES TO COURT.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.333
- IF WE DON'T CATCH ANYONE,
THIS WILL NEVER GO TO COURT.

16:18.333 --> 16:21.834
- I THINK DETECTIVE QUINN
HAS A POINT.

16:21.834 --> 16:24.834
WE LET WORD OUT ABOUT
THE SNAKES.

16:24.834 --> 16:26.959
THE PRESS WILL EAT IT UP.
WHO KNOWS?

16:26.959 --> 16:28.875
MAYBE SOMETHING
WILL SHAKE LOOSE.

16:28.875 --> 16:31.625
- WHAT ABOUT THE TRIAL?

16:31.625 --> 16:32.917
- WELL, QUINN'S RIGHT.

16:32.917 --> 16:33.959
THERE'LL NEVER BE A TRIAL

16:33.959 --> 16:35.792
UNLESS WE GET SOMEONE
INTO CUSTODY.

16:35.792 --> 16:36.875
I THINK IT'S WORTH A TRY.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.792
ANGEL, GET STARTED
ON THE STATEMENT.

16:39.792 --> 16:42.000
HAVE IT ON MY DESK
BY THIS AFTERNOON.

16:49.166 --> 16:52.709
- I DON'T THINK YOU
REALLY BELIEVE

16:52.709 --> 16:54.083
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING,
NATHAN!

16:54.083 --> 16:56.458
YOU NEED TO BELIEVE
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING!

16:56.458 --> 16:57.667
- I DO.
I SWEAR.

16:57.667 --> 17:01.166
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
YOU WANT FROM ME.

17:01.166 --> 17:05.333
- I WANT TO HEAR YOU TELL GOD
THAT YOU ARE SORRY.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.500
- OKAY.
OKAY.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.417
PLEASE, PLEASE, GOD...

17:09.417 --> 17:13.625
I'M SORRY FOR--FOR--
FOR EVERYTHING I'VE EVER DONE.

17:13.625 --> 17:15.667
JUST FORGIVE ME.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.083
FORGIVE ME.

17:18.083 --> 17:21.375
FOR...GIVE ME.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.250
[sobbing]

17:29.750 --> 17:30.834
NO, NO.
WAIT. WAIT.

17:30.834 --> 17:32.875
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
LET ME GO!

17:32.875 --> 17:34.291
LET ME GO!

17:34.291 --> 17:36.166
[sniffling]

17:45.375 --> 17:48.500
- HE'S TELLING YOU WHAT YOU
WANT TO HEAR.

17:48.500 --> 17:53.000
HE THINKS WE'RE GONNA
RELEASE HIM.

17:59.709 --> 18:04.792
- HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE
HAVE TO MAKE HIM SUFFER?

18:04.792 --> 18:08.250
- YOU REALLY HAVE A GOOD HEART,
TRAVIS.

18:08.250 --> 18:12.750
THAT'S WHY I PICKED YOU.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.750
BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE
AT STAKE HERE

18:15.750 --> 18:19.208
THAN ONE MAN'S SUFFERING.

18:19.208 --> 18:23.166
DON'T WE HAVE TO BE STRONG?

18:23.166 --> 18:27.375
HE HAS TO BE PURE
OR WE CAN'T PROCEED.

18:29.417 --> 18:30.583
- YES.

18:30.583 --> 18:33.625
- HEY, HE'S COMING AROUND.

18:33.625 --> 18:36.875
IT JUST TAKES TIME.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.417
- GOOD MORNING, WALTER.

18:49.417 --> 18:52.583
- KEEP SAYING THAT AND ONE DAY
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.792
- SAM'S GROUP IS ABOUT
TO TEE OFF.

18:54.792 --> 18:57.959
YOU CAN JOIN THEM.

18:57.959 --> 18:59.625
- HEY, I'M SHORT A PARTNER.

18:59.625 --> 19:01.125
DAN.

19:01.125 --> 19:03.792
- WALTER KENNEY.

19:03.792 --> 19:05.792
- I'M A LITTLE RUSTY,

19:05.792 --> 19:07.250
BUT I'LL TRY
NOT TO SLOW YOU DOWN.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.417
- JUST GET A CART,
WILL YOU?

19:14.458 --> 19:16.917
WORST MISTAKE I EVER MADE
WAS MOVING DOWN

19:16.917 --> 19:21.250
TO THIS PISS-BUTT
CORNER COUNTRY.

19:21.250 --> 19:23.458
- HOW BAD CAN IT BE?
IT'S THE SUNSHINE STATE.

19:23.458 --> 19:27.750
- ONLY SUNSHINE AROUND HERE IS
WHAT THEY BLOW UP YOUR ASS.

19:27.750 --> 19:31.125
THE REST IS MOSQUITOES,
HUMIDITY,

19:31.125 --> 19:32.458
AND PEOPLE THAT DON'T
SPEAK ENGLISH.

19:32.458 --> 19:34.917
[fly buzzing]

19:34.917 --> 19:37.125
SO WHAT'S A YOUNG GUY
LIKE YOU

19:37.125 --> 19:39.208
DOING AROUND CORAL ISLAND,

19:39.208 --> 19:42.583
OR DO YOU GET OFF HANGING OUT
WITH CORPSES?

19:42.583 --> 19:44.500
- [chuckles]

19:44.500 --> 19:46.625
I'M CHECKING IT OUT
FOR MY DAD.

19:46.625 --> 19:48.000
- YOU WANT TO HELP YOUR DAD?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.834
TAKE HIM TO THE END OF THE PIER
AND PUSH HIM OFF.

19:49.834 --> 19:52.166
YOU'LL BE DOING HIM A FAVOR.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.166
IF I WAS ANY MORE
IN THE ROUGH,

19:54.166 --> 19:56.125
I'D NEED A FUCKING MACHETE.

19:56.125 --> 20:00.417
- THIS IS LIKE BEING TRAPPED
IN A TOXIC CLOUD...

20:00.417 --> 20:02.875
THAT CHEATS.

20:06.959 --> 20:09.500
- OH!
SON OF A BITCH!

20:09.500 --> 20:10.834
- YOU OKAY?

20:10.834 --> 20:12.875
- OH, I ALWAYS SCREAM IN PAIN
WHEN I TAKE A SWING.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.709
DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

20:14.709 --> 20:16.208
I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

20:16.208 --> 20:17.959
- ALL RIGHT.

20:17.959 --> 20:20.834
- OH, I RUPTURED MY BACK
TWO YEARS AGO.

20:20.834 --> 20:22.125
IT HASN'T BEEN THE SAME SINCE.

20:22.125 --> 20:24.041
- OKAY, JUST TAKE IT EASY.

20:24.041 --> 20:25.417
- JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!

20:25.417 --> 20:27.625
LISTEN, I'M DONE HERE.

20:27.625 --> 20:30.834
JUST DROP ME OFF
AT THE CLUB BAR.

20:30.834 --> 20:32.041
I NEED SOMETHING
TO KILL THE PAIN.

20:32.041 --> 20:35.041
- YOU GOT IT.

20:35.041 --> 20:37.333
- [grunts]

20:41.291 --> 20:45.000
- SO WHAT'D YOU USED TO DO
UP IN OREGON?

20:45.000 --> 20:48.375
- I WAS A PIPEFITTER
FOR 25 YEARS.

20:48.375 --> 20:51.875
SHIT JOB, BUT I MANAGED
TO WORK UP A PENSION.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.291
ALL I WANT TO DO NOW
IS PLAY GOLF.

20:54.291 --> 20:55.834
- MMM.

20:55.834 --> 20:58.333
MAYBE YOU SHOULD FIND SOMETHING
ELSE TO PASS THE TIME.

20:58.333 --> 21:02.417
- I TELL YOU, IT'S HELL NOT
BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU LOVE.

21:02.417 --> 21:04.709
- IS HE TALKING ABOUT GOLF
OR HIS FAILURE

21:04.709 --> 21:09.083
TO RIP OUT ROSALIA DAVOLOS'
TOOTH?

21:09.083 --> 21:11.291
WALTER KENNEY MAY BE
THE WORLD'S OLDEST ASSHOLE,

21:11.291 --> 21:13.417
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM
A KILLER.

21:13.417 --> 21:16.375
- ON THE OTHER HAND,
MAYBE I GAVE UP TOO SOON.

21:20.083 --> 21:23.417
- HE WEARS A DENTAL IMPLANT
FOR THE LATERAL INCISOR.

21:23.417 --> 21:25.375
THE SAME ONE THE TOOTH FAIRY
PULLED FROM HIS VICTIMS.

21:25.375 --> 21:29.583
[cell phone rings]

21:29.583 --> 21:31.500
EXCUSE ME.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.917
HELLO?

21:32.917 --> 21:35.208
- THIS IS SAM FROM
GOOD SHEPHERD AUTO.

21:35.208 --> 21:37.208
I WAS JUST CALLING TO
LET YOU KNOW YOUR CAR'S READY.

21:37.208 --> 21:38.583
- GREAT.
WHEN CAN I PICK IT UP?

21:38.583 --> 21:40.458
- WELL, IF YOU GET HERE
BEFORE 6:00,

21:40.458 --> 21:42.917
YOU WON'T HAVE TO FIGHT
THE DOG OFF THIS TIME.

21:42.917 --> 21:44.125
[chuckles]

21:44.125 --> 21:45.875
- I'M ON MY WAY.
- OKAY.

21:45.875 --> 21:47.417
[phone beeps]

21:56.750 --> 21:58.458
- THIS IS ON ME.

21:58.458 --> 22:00.542
I GOT TO GO PICK UP MY CAR.

22:00.542 --> 22:02.041
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'VE GOT A SHIT-LOAD OF ERRANDS

22:02.041 --> 22:04.125
TO RUN TOMORROW AND
WITH MY BACK THE WAY IT IS,

22:04.125 --> 22:06.375
I'M GONNA HAVE
A REAL HARD TIME ON THE BUS.

22:06.375 --> 22:08.375
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO GIVE ME
A RIDE, WOULD YOU?

22:08.375 --> 22:09.959
- PERFECT, NOW I WON'T HAVE
TO MAKE AN EXCUSE

22:09.959 --> 22:11.125
TO RUN INTO YOU AGAIN.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.792
- I'M IN 72.

22:12.792 --> 22:14.458
PICK ME UP AT 9:00.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.166
- ACTUALLY, I'D RATHER
HAVE MY TEETH PULLED.

22:16.166 --> 22:17.333
HAPPY TO DO IT.

22:39.208 --> 22:42.917
- PEOPLE DON'T PUT NO OIL IN IT
AND THEN WONDER WHY THEY--

22:42.917 --> 22:44.208
HEY.

22:44.208 --> 22:45.959
HEY, MAN, YEAH.
SHE'S RIGHT DOWN HERE.

22:45.959 --> 22:47.125
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, NICK.

22:47.125 --> 22:49.041
- [speaking Spanish]

22:49.041 --> 22:50.125
- HEY, GOD BLESS HIM.

22:50.125 --> 22:52.291
NICK HAS BEEN BUSTING HIS ASS,
MAN.

22:52.291 --> 22:55.166
OFF THE DRUGS.
CUT HIS TIES WITH THE GANG, MAN.

22:55.166 --> 22:58.125
I--I REALLY THINK HE WANTS
TO CHANGE.

22:58.125 --> 22:59.542
- YOU MUST BE RELIEVED.

22:59.542 --> 23:01.875
- I'M PROUD OF HIM IS WHAT
I AM, MAN.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.875
IT'S NOT EASY TURNING YOUR
LIFE AROUND, MAN.

23:03.875 --> 23:05.375
IT COULD GO SOUTH
AT ANY MINUTE,

23:05.375 --> 23:09.125
BUT I'LL TAKE THE BLESSINGS
AS THEY COME.

23:09.125 --> 23:10.625
- THIS LOOKS LIKE THE DAY
I BOUGHT IT.

23:10.625 --> 23:11.917
YOU DO GOOD WORK.

23:11.917 --> 23:13.125
- [chuckles]

23:13.125 --> 23:15.208
WELL, IT'S--IT'S ALL THESE
REPAIR JOBS

23:15.208 --> 23:18.875
THAT PAY FOR THAT GOOD WORK.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.458
LISTEN.

23:20.458 --> 23:22.000
YOU GOT ANY PLANS THIS SUNDAY?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.375
LIKE SERVICE?

23:24.375 --> 23:25.875
- WHAT WOULD I
BE GETTING SERVICED?

23:25.875 --> 23:27.000

23:27.000 --> 23:28.792
UH, LIKE A CHURCH SERVICE.

23:28.792 --> 23:31.542

23:33.709 --> 23:36.250
WELL, WE HAVING SOMETHING

IT'D BE GREAT
IF YOU COULD COME.

23:39.083 --> 23:40.500
- WELL, THIS SUNDAY'S TOUGH.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.041
I DON'T HAVE A SITTER
FOR HARRISON.

23:42.041 --> 23:43.250
- OH, THAT'S YOUR BOY?

23:43.250 --> 23:46.041

23:46.041 --> 23:48.041

23:48.041 --> 23:49.834
IT'S A KID-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT.

23:49.834 --> 23:51.250
HE'LL LOVE IT.

23:51.250 --> 23:54.375
PLAY SOME BALL,
PUT THE GRILL ON,

23:54.375 --> 23:57.875

BARBECUE BAPTISM.

23:57.875 --> 24:00.709

24:00.709 --> 24:02.667
HE'S TAKING THE BIG LEAP,
PRAISE GOD.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.917
HE'S TAKING THE HOLY SPIRIT
ON RIGHT THERE

24:04.917 --> 24:06.375
IN THE WATERS
OF THE BISCAYNE BAY.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.417
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET ME TO GO TO CHURCH.

24:08.417 --> 24:10.125
- SO WHAT?

24:10.125 --> 24:13.250
WHAT, YOU AFRAID YOU
GONNA CATCH SOMETHING?

24:13.250 --> 24:16.291
- I'M JUST NOT SURE I FIT IN.

24:16.291 --> 24:17.917
- SURE YOU DO.

24:17.917 --> 24:19.834
LISTEN.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.166
I JUST THINK IT'D BE GREAT
FOR YOU

24:22.166 --> 24:24.792
TO TAKE A STAND WITH SOMEONE
WHOSE LIFE

24:24.792 --> 24:27.041
THAT YOU HELPED TURN AROUND.

24:27.041 --> 24:30.125
AND IF YOU DO HAPPEN
TO FIND GOD,

24:30.125 --> 24:31.917
A LOT WORSE WAYS YOU COULD
SPEND YOUR DAY OFF.

24:44.709 --> 24:46.625
- ONLY ONE MENTION
OF WALTER KENNEY

24:46.625 --> 24:50.041
IN THE CRIMINAL DATABASE
AND HE'S IDENTIFIED AS A VICTIM.

24:50.041 --> 24:51.458
WALTER KENNEY'S MOTHER,

24:51.458 --> 24:53.959
CHARGED WITH FELONY CHILD ABUSE
AGAINST HER SON.

24:53.959 --> 24:57.291
[door opens]

24:57.291 --> 24:59.417
- I HAVE TO VENT OR MY HEAD'S
GONNA EXPLODE.

24:59.417 --> 25:01.875
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- EVERYTHING.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.333
I'M MY EX-BOYFRIEND'S BOSS.

25:03.333 --> 25:05.291
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT.

25:05.291 --> 25:07.709
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I DON'T KNOW WHO TO HIRE.

25:07.709 --> 25:10.208
I HAVE A STACK OF PAPERWORK
ON MY DESK

25:10.208 --> 25:11.333
THAT'S TALLER THAN I AM.

25:11.333 --> 25:12.667
- WELL, TAKE A BREATH,
SIT DOWN.

25:12.667 --> 25:16.333
- I THINK I REALLY FUCKED UP
TAKING THIS PROMOTION.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.959
I WAS A FUCKING GREAT DETECTIVE

25:18.959 --> 25:22.417
WHO LOVED HER FUCKING JOB.

25:22.417 --> 25:25.000
I TRADED IT ALL IN
FOR POLITICS

25:25.000 --> 25:27.417
AND PAPERWORK AND LAGUERTA
UP MY ASS.

25:27.417 --> 25:28.458
- DEB, YOU'RE TOO SMART
TO THINK

25:28.458 --> 25:30.000
THAT THIS WAS GONNA BE EASY.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.166
- WELL, I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.

25:31.166 --> 25:32.500
I DIDN'T EXPECT PEOPLE
SITTING AROUND

25:32.500 --> 25:33.875
WAITING FOR ME TO FALL
ON MY FACE.

25:33.875 --> 25:35.959
- NO ONE WANTS YOU TO FAIL.
- [scoffs]

25:35.959 --> 25:38.000
- OKAY, LAGUERTA PROBABLY
WOULDN'T LOSE ANY SLEEP

25:38.000 --> 25:39.333
IF YOU STUMBLED A BIT.

25:39.333 --> 25:40.583
- SHE'D POP A BOTTLE
OF CHAMPAGNE.

25:40.583 --> 25:42.166
- BUT GUESS WHAT.
YOU'RE NEW AT THE JOB.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.375
YOU'RE GONNA STUMBLE.

25:44.375 --> 25:45.542
YOU THINK LAGUERTA
NEVER MESSED UP?

25:45.542 --> 25:46.875
- SHIT YEAH.

25:46.875 --> 25:49.250
- CUT YOURSELF SOME SLACK.

25:49.250 --> 25:50.709
YOU'VE BEEN LIEUTENANT ONE DAY.

25:50.709 --> 25:52.625
IF A COUPLE MONTHS GO BY,
YOU STILL HATE IT,

25:52.625 --> 25:54.834
YOU CAN DEMOTE YOURSELF,
BUT UNTIL THEN,

25:54.834 --> 25:56.166
JUST GO WITH YOUR GUT.

25:56.166 --> 25:57.375
AND WHEN YOU SCREW UP,

25:57.375 --> 25:59.041
JUST DON'T TAKE ME DOWN
WITH YOU.

25:59.041 --> 26:01.417
I NEED THE PAYCHECK.

26:01.417 --> 26:03.458
- OKAY.

26:03.458 --> 26:05.250
MY PANIC NEEDLE'S SWINGING OUT
OF THE RED.

26:05.250 --> 26:07.375
- GOOD.

26:07.375 --> 26:11.000
HOW ARE YOU
WITH THE QUINN OF IT?

26:11.000 --> 26:12.667
- I MISS BEING WITH HIM.

26:12.667 --> 26:14.959
- REALLY?

26:14.959 --> 26:16.500
- QUINN'S A GOOD GUY.
WE HAD FUN TOGETHER.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.959
IT WAS EASY.
NO EXPECTATIONS.

26:18.959 --> 26:21.333
THAT'S ONE DECISION
I KNOW I MADE RIGHT.

26:21.333 --> 26:24.500
QUINN AND I WERE NEVER MEANT
TO GET SERIOUS.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.875
I HAVE TO GO.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.917
I HAVE TO PUT PEOPLE
ON THE SNAKES KILLING.

26:27.917 --> 26:30.000
THANK YOU FOR TALKING ME
OFF THE LEDGE.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.333
YOU'RE THE BEST.

26:31.333 --> 26:33.458
- IS IT A GOOD TIME FOR ME
TO ASK FOR A RAISE?

26:33.458 --> 26:36.125
- TERRIBLE.
- I'M SERIOUS.

26:36.125 --> 26:38.792
- FUCK OFF AND DIE.

26:41.917 --> 26:44.500
- MAYBE SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN THE PROMOTION.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.333
SHE MIGHT NOT BE CUT OUT
FOR IT.

26:46.333 --> 26:48.875
- I THINK THERE'S VERY LITTLE
DEB'S NOT CUT OUT FOR.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.625
[sighs]

26:51.625 --> 26:53.709
KENNEY'S MOTHER
WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY

26:53.709 --> 26:59.417
FOR REPEATEDLY HITTING HER SON
IN THE FACE IN PUBLIC.

26:59.417 --> 27:00.500
- I'M NOT SEEING THE CONNECTION.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.250
- MAYBE THAT'S HOW HE
LOST HIS TOOTH.

27:02.250 --> 27:05.000
- SO WALTER KENNEY
HAS MOTHER ISSUES.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.375
SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.667
DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE IS
THE TOOTH FAIRY.

27:08.667 --> 27:09.959
- AH, BUT IT'S ANOTHER REASON
FOR ME

27:09.959 --> 27:13.750
TO SPEND MY DAY OFF
WITH MISTER SUNSHINE.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.000
[knocking on door]

27:34.500 --> 27:37.458
YOU SAID 9:00.

27:37.458 --> 27:38.792
- I JUST NEED
A COUPLE OF SECONDS.

27:50.542 --> 27:53.667
- TV, BARCALOUNGER,
AND A VIEW OF THE PARKING LOT.

27:53.667 --> 27:58.667
THIS WASN'T ON
THE CORAL ISLAND BROCHURE.

28:21.959 --> 28:25.375
- MY SON.

28:25.375 --> 28:27.834
GAVE HIM EVERYTHING
IN LIFE

28:27.834 --> 28:30.917
AND NOW I CAN'T GET HIM
ON THE PHONE.

28:30.917 --> 28:34.291
YOU HAVE KIDS?

28:34.291 --> 28:35.458
YOU'RE LUCKY.

28:35.458 --> 28:38.166
UNGRATEFUL LITTLE PRICKS.

28:38.166 --> 28:41.542
THEY SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF YOU
AND THEN THEY VANISH.

28:41.542 --> 28:45.542
WHERE ARE MY FUCKING
HOUSE KEYS?

28:45.542 --> 28:47.375
- HE'S COMPLETELY ALONE.

28:47.375 --> 28:52.542
ALIENATED EVERYONE AROUND HIM.

28:52.542 --> 28:53.583
- AH!
[keys jingle]

28:53.583 --> 28:55.375
HERE THEY ARE.

28:55.375 --> 28:57.417
I'M LOSING MY FUCKING MIND.

28:57.417 --> 29:00.709
[ambulance radio chatter]

29:00.709 --> 29:03.458
[chuckles]

29:03.458 --> 29:08.667
ABRAMS IN 23.

29:08.667 --> 29:13.250
DUMB AS A BAG OF DOG SHIT.

29:13.250 --> 29:17.542
LOOKS LIKE A SPACE JUST OPENED
UP FOR YOUR DAD.

29:26.750 --> 29:29.375
[grunts]
AW, SHIT.

29:29.375 --> 29:31.417
UH...

29:31.417 --> 29:33.250
HERE'S MY PRESCRIPTION.

29:33.250 --> 29:35.166
JUST PICK IT UP FOR ME,
WILL YOU?

29:35.166 --> 29:38.166
[grunts]

29:38.166 --> 29:39.959
- SURE.

29:42.917 --> 29:46.750
- OH, HEY, HEY, HEY!

29:46.750 --> 29:48.834
AND A SIX-PACK OF BEER
FROM THE LIQUOR STORE

29:48.834 --> 29:53.917
AND THE LATEST TEEN ASS,
NIPPLE PARADE,  AND  SPANKED.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.166
- TEEN ASS, NIPPLE PARADE,
AND SPANKED.

29:56.166 --> 30:02.000
CAN THIS REALLY BE THE MAN WHO
INSPIRED ME TO KEEP A SCRAPBOOK?

30:09.125 --> 30:10.625
CAN I GET...

30:10.625 --> 30:13.959
TEEN ASS, NIPPLE PARADE,
AND SPANKED?

30:13.959 --> 30:16.000
- AH!

30:21.583 --> 30:24.417
SOME NEEDS JUST DON'T
GO AWAY...

30:24.417 --> 30:27.500
EVEN IF THE EQUIPMENT
IS ON LIFE SUPPORT.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.917
- DOES THAT HOLD TRUE
FOR KILLING?

30:35.709 --> 30:38.875
- JUST ONE MORE STOP AND THEN
I'M OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
I'LL TAKE THE BUS HOME
FROM HERE.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.083
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR BACK?

30:50.083 --> 30:52.458
- GOT MY REMEDY.

30:52.458 --> 30:54.291
[sighs]

30:54.291 --> 30:55.667
SEE YA.

30:55.667 --> 30:57.583
- [sighs]

30:57.583 --> 30:58.875
[engine turns]

31:13.667 --> 31:15.458
WHAT WRONG TURNS
DO YOU TAKE

31:15.458 --> 31:19.000
TO LEAD TO THIS AT THE END
OF YOUR LIFE?

31:22.125 --> 31:24.625
AN 8X12 STORAGE SHED,
A 6-PACK OF BEER,

31:24.625 --> 31:26.834
AND A STACK OF PORNO MAGS.

31:26.834 --> 31:30.500
[storage unit door closes]

31:33.000 --> 31:35.333
- I NEED THOSE RUNDOWNS
ON THE INTERVIEWS YOU DID

31:35.333 --> 31:36.709
WITH THE VICTIM'S JOHNS.

31:36.709 --> 31:38.583
- YEAH, I'M STILL WORKING
ON 'EM.

31:38.583 --> 31:40.166
- ANYTHING I SHOULD KNOW?

31:40.166 --> 31:41.625
- YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE ALL SKETCHY CHARACTERS,

31:41.625 --> 31:43.875
BUT THEIR ALIBIS CHECK OUT.

31:43.875 --> 31:46.291
- UH, FINAL FORENSICS REPORT
ON THE SNAKES KILLING.

31:46.291 --> 31:47.375
NOTHING NEW,
BUT IF YOU NOTICE

31:47.375 --> 31:49.083
THE GRAMMAR'S IMPROVED,

31:49.083 --> 31:51.709
IT'S BECAUSE RYAN
TYPED IT UP.

31:51.709 --> 31:53.208
- SO...RYAN, RIGHT?

31:53.208 --> 31:55.208
YOU'VE BEEN HERE A WEEK NOW.

31:55.208 --> 31:56.834
HOW YOU LIKING IT?

31:56.834 --> 31:58.417
- IT'S HEAVEN.
- HEAVEN?

31:58.417 --> 32:01.375
EVEN WITH VINCE AROUND?
- HA-HA, GOOD ONE.

32:01.375 --> 32:03.458
- I LOVE HOMICIDE.

32:03.458 --> 32:05.834
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED
BY PEOPLE WHO DO BAD THINGS.

32:05.834 --> 32:07.750
- MAYBE THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU
GOT A LITTLE BAD IN YOU.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.917
- YOU THINK?

32:09.917 --> 32:12.792
- OH, I THINK YOU GOT
A LOT OF BAD IN YOU.

32:12.792 --> 32:15.375
- YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

32:15.375 --> 32:16.750
- YEAH.

32:16.750 --> 32:20.250
- BUT YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

32:20.250 --> 32:23.917
- [chuckles]

32:23.917 --> 32:27.083
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

32:29.375 --> 32:31.542
- [clears throat]

32:31.542 --> 32:33.500
WE'RE, UH,
STILL INTERVIEWING

32:33.500 --> 32:34.500
ROSALIA'S JOHNS.

32:34.500 --> 32:37.917
SO FAR, NOTHING.
- NOT ABOUT THE CASE.

32:37.917 --> 32:40.583
I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU'RE DOING
WITH THE WHOLE SITUATION.

32:40.583 --> 32:43.083
- RIGHT.
UH, I'M GOOD.

32:43.083 --> 32:44.250
UH, MATTER OF FACT,

32:44.250 --> 32:45.458
I JUST GOT DONE
PACKING UP YOUR STUFF.

32:45.458 --> 32:47.750
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

32:47.750 --> 32:50.125
- YOU KNOW, I FIGURED YOU'RE
BUSY WITH YOUR NEW JOB AND ALL.

32:50.125 --> 32:51.875
YOU KNOW, MIGHT NOT HAVE TIME.

32:51.875 --> 32:52.917
KIND OF WANTED IT OUT
OF THE HOUSE.

32:52.917 --> 32:55.208
SO, UM, IF YOU WANT
TO PICK IT UP,

32:55.208 --> 32:59.083
IT'S IN THE GARAGE RIGHT NEXT
TO THE BIG BAG OF FERTILIZER.

33:01.542 --> 33:03.166
- QUINN, I KNOW YOU'RE PISSED.

33:03.166 --> 33:06.458
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB
OF LETTING ME KNOW THAT.

33:06.458 --> 33:08.834
BUT THIS WASN'T EASY
ON ME EITHER.

33:08.834 --> 33:09.959
- I'M SURE.

33:09.959 --> 33:11.083
YOU KNOW, FROM WHAT I HEAR,
THAT PROMOTION

33:11.083 --> 33:12.291
JUST CAME OUT OF THE BLUE.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.125
- YOU THINK THAT
MY BECOMING LIEUTENANT

33:14.125 --> 33:16.291
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US?

33:16.291 --> 33:18.625
- NO, I'M SURE IT WAS JUST
A BIG FUCKING COINCIDENCE.

33:18.625 --> 33:21.625
- QUINN, THAT IS SO
FUCKING UNFAIR.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.458
- THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT
OF THAT GOING AROUND.

33:23.458 --> 33:24.500
I GOT MY SHARE.

33:24.500 --> 33:28.458
MAYBE YOU'RE GETTING YOURS.

33:30.375 --> 33:33.458

AH!

[grunts]

34:36.625 --> 34:37.875
DON'T HURT ME.

34:37.875 --> 34:40.542
- YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE,
NATHAN.

34:40.542 --> 34:41.917
ARE YOU GOING TO BE SAVED?

34:41.917 --> 34:44.458
IT'S UP TO YOU.
- YES, PLEASE!

34:44.458 --> 34:47.000
PLEASE.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.750
[sobbing]
DEAR GOD, CLEANSE ME

34:48.750 --> 34:51.583
OF ALL MY SINS.

34:51.583 --> 34:54.625
FORGIVE ME FOR ALL THE EVIL
THAT I'VE DONE.

34:54.625 --> 34:58.250
FORGIVE ME FOR--

34:58.250 --> 35:00.917
FORGIVE ME.

35:00.917 --> 35:05.125
FORGIVE ME.
[sobbing]

FORGIVE ME.

35:09.667 --> 35:13.083
- HE'S READY.

35:16.333 --> 35:18.583
- TWO HOURS IN THAT
STORAGE FACILITY.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.000
I'M GUESSING HE WASN'T

35:20.000 --> 35:22.959
ORGANIZING HIS
PENTHOUSE  COLLECTION.

36:46.834 --> 36:49.041
IT'S LIKE MY BOX OF SLIDES.

36:52.041 --> 36:54.125
DRIED BLOOD ON THE ROOTS.

36:54.125 --> 36:57.875
THESE ARE FROM ALL
OF HIS VICTIMS.

36:57.875 --> 37:00.333
HE'S THE TOOTH FAIRY.

37:05.709 --> 37:10.125
THE MAN WHO TERRORIZED THE
PACIFIC NORTHWEST FOR 20 YEARS.

37:10.125 --> 37:13.792
ALL HE HAS LEFT
IS A BOX OF TEETH.

37:13.792 --> 37:17.875
IS THIS WHAT HAPPENS
TO SERIAL KILLERS

37:17.875 --> 37:22.208
AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES?

37:27.375 --> 37:28.750
EVERYTHING'S READY.

37:28.750 --> 37:30.709
KENNEY'S APARTMENT WILL MAKE
THE PERFECT KILL ROOM.

37:30.709 --> 37:32.333
NO ONE EVER VISITS HIM
AND THE MAID

37:32.333 --> 37:35.375
WON'T SHOW UP UNTIL
THE MORNING.

37:35.375 --> 37:38.083
TONIGHT, WALTER KENNEY
WILL HAVE HIS FINAL TEE OFF.

37:38.083 --> 37:43.542
[cell phone rings]

37:43.542 --> 37:45.583
[sighs]

37:45.583 --> 37:47.375
HELLO?
- IT'S WALTER.

37:47.375 --> 37:48.583
I'M REALLY FUCKED!

37:48.583 --> 37:49.917
- WHAT IS IT?

37:49.917 --> 37:51.750
- I GOT OFF AT THE WRONG STOP
AND NOW

37:51.750 --> 37:53.250
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE HELL I AM.

37:53.250 --> 37:55.709
I'VE BEEN RIDING AROUND
FOR HOURS.

37:55.709 --> 37:57.250
FUCKING HELL!
- OKAY, OKAY.

37:57.250 --> 37:59.834
JUST CALM DOWN.
I'LL SWING BY AND PICK YOU UP.

37:59.834 --> 38:03.875
WHAT'S THE STREET NAME
AND NUMBER OF THE BUS STOP?

38:03.875 --> 38:07.291
- 321...ALATKA.

38:07.291 --> 38:08.250
- GOT IT.

38:08.250 --> 38:09.375
JUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

38:09.375 --> 38:11.375
I'LL BE THERE IN TEN MINUTES.

38:11.375 --> 38:13.208
HE MADE IT EASY FOR ME
TO VET HIM.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.417
NOW HE'S MAKING IT EASY
FOR ME TO KILL HIM.

38:15.417 --> 38:18.333
KENNEY'S A MONSTER,
BUT AT LEAST HE'S CONSIDERATE.

38:32.959 --> 38:34.750
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE FUCK'S WRONG WITH ME.

38:34.750 --> 38:37.458
SOMETIMES I GET SO CONFUSED.

38:37.458 --> 38:38.709
- YEAH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

38:38.709 --> 38:40.750
I'M JUST GLAD I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

38:40.750 --> 38:42.625
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WOULD HAVE DONE

38:42.625 --> 38:45.917
IF YOU HADN'T ANSWERED.

38:45.917 --> 38:47.625
YOU'RE A GOOD KID.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.542
- AS IF I WASN'T STARTING
TO FEEL ENOUGH PITY FOR HIM,

38:49.542 --> 38:50.959
NOW HE'S THROWING GRATITUDE
AT ME?

38:50.959 --> 38:52.125
[gun clicks]

38:52.125 --> 38:54.458
- KEEP YOUR EYE
ON THE ROAD...

38:54.458 --> 38:57.667
OR I'LL BLOW YOUR HEAD
OUT THE WINDOW.

38:57.667 --> 38:59.750
DRIVE UNTIL I TELL YOU
TO TURN.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.333
HOW DID YOU GET ON TO ME?

39:01.333 --> 39:02.959
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

39:02.959 --> 39:05.542
- YOU'RE MIAMI METRO, DEXTER.

39:05.542 --> 39:07.667
I CHECKED YOUR
CAR REGISTRATION

39:07.667 --> 39:10.166
WHEN YOU WERE FILLING
MY PRESCRIPTION,

39:10.166 --> 39:12.166
AND THEN I "GOGGLED"
YOUR NAME.

39:12.166 --> 39:14.667
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, DICKWAD.

39:14.667 --> 39:17.166
MAYBE I HAVEN'T TAKEN A DECENT
SHIT IN TEN YEARS,

39:17.166 --> 39:21.000
BUT I'M NOT FUCKING STUPID.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
TURN RIGHT AT THE NEXT LIGHT.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.291
- OKAY.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.083
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

39:32.083 --> 39:33.834
- TO SETTLE OUR BUSINESS.

39:33.834 --> 39:37.458
AND YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
HOW YOU FIGURED OUT WHO I AM.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.000
- AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA
KILL ME?

39:39.000 --> 39:42.166
- YOU HAVEN'T LEFT ME MUCH
CHOICE, HAVE YOU?

39:42.166 --> 39:44.792
LEFT INTO THE NEXT
PARKING LOT.

39:44.792 --> 39:48.625
- OKAY.

39:48.625 --> 39:50.000
- JUST FOR KICKS,

39:50.000 --> 39:54.709
I MIGHT RIP OUT ALL YOUR TEETH
BEFORE I SHOOT YOU.

39:54.709 --> 39:56.834
[engine revs]
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU--

39:56.834 --> 39:58.375
[screams]

39:58.375 --> 40:01.417
[gunshot]

40:03.125 --> 40:07.542
[centrifuge whirring]

40:07.542 --> 40:10.500
- UH, THOSE ARE, UH,
READY FOR CATALOGING.

40:10.500 --> 40:13.041
HEY, UM, AFTER WORK TONIGHT,
YOU WANT TO GRAB SOME PHO?

40:13.041 --> 40:15.208
- GRAB SOME WHAT?

40:15.208 --> 40:16.333
- UH, IT'S VIETNAMESE FOOD.

40:16.333 --> 40:19.041
IT'S BASICALLY A LARGE BOWL
OF NOODLES.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.959
AND BROTH.

40:20.959 --> 40:23.000
- SO YOU'RE ASKING ME OUT?

40:23.000 --> 40:24.250
AS IN A DATE?

40:24.250 --> 40:25.166
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO CALL IT THAT

40:25.166 --> 40:26.250
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

40:26.250 --> 40:28.917
- I WANT TO.

40:28.917 --> 40:30.250
- SO THAT'S A YES?

40:30.250 --> 40:32.083
- YEAH.

40:32.083 --> 40:34.083
- [exhales]
WOW.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.458
- WHAT?

40:36.458 --> 40:38.458
- IT'S JUST THAT I RAN
THE CONVERSATION

40:38.458 --> 40:39.583
THROUGH MY MIND
AND BUNCH OF TIMES.

40:39.583 --> 40:42.792
IT ALWAYS ENDED IN REJECTION
AND BODILY HARM.

40:42.792 --> 40:45.375
- YOU SHOULD BE MORE CONFIDENT.

40:45.375 --> 40:47.083
YOU KNOW, IN THE RIGHT LIGHT,
YOU'RE ACTUALLY KIND OF CUTE.

40:47.083 --> 40:49.417
- [chuckles]

40:49.417 --> 40:51.834
- I'M ABOUT TO INTERVIEW
MY TOP PICK

40:51.834 --> 40:53.250
FOR THE DETECTIVE SLOT.

40:53.250 --> 40:54.792
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO SIT IN.

40:54.792 --> 40:56.208
- OH, NO POINT.

40:56.208 --> 40:57.291
SAM HARMON AND I GO WAY BACK.

40:57.291 --> 40:58.917
- HARMON'S NOT MY TOP CHOICE.

40:58.917 --> 41:00.417
- HE'S NOT?

41:00.417 --> 41:03.208
- IT'S MIKE ANDERSON,
THE TRANSFER FROM CHICAGO.

41:03.208 --> 41:05.041
HE'S GOT TEN YEARS
ON HOMICIDE,

41:05.041 --> 41:06.458
A RIDICULOUS SOLVE RATE,

41:06.458 --> 41:08.834
RECOMMENDATIONS COMING
OUT OF HIS ASS.

41:08.834 --> 41:09.917
WE'D BE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM.

41:09.917 --> 41:11.667
I REALLY PUT A LOT
OF THOUGHT INTO THIS.

41:11.667 --> 41:13.583
- IF THAT'S TRUE,
THEN I'M SERIOUSLY

41:13.583 --> 41:14.917
WORRIED ABOUT YOUR JUDGMENT,

41:14.917 --> 41:16.792
BECAUSE THIS
IS A HUGE MISTAKE.

41:16.792 --> 41:18.959
- I DON'T THINK IT IS.

41:18.959 --> 41:20.500
LOOK, I KNOW I'M NEW
AT THIS JOB.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.458
AND IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T
VALUE YOUR ADVICE,

41:22.458 --> 41:25.500
BUT SOMETIMES I HAVE
TO TRUST MY GUT,

41:25.500 --> 41:27.750
AND RIGHT NOW MY GUT
IS TELLING ME MIKE ANDERSON.

41:27.750 --> 41:30.959
- IT'S YOUR DECISION,
LIEUTENANT.

41:30.959 --> 41:33.250
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER
THE HELL YOU WANT.

41:33.250 --> 41:35.083
BUT UNDERSTAND THIS.
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

41:35.083 --> 41:37.792
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT,

41:37.792 --> 41:39.792
DON'T LOOK TO ME
TO HAVE YOUR BACK.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.041
[elevator bell rings]

41:45.041 --> 41:50.166
[overlapping chatter]

41:53.625 --> 41:55.291
- MIKE ANDERSON.

41:55.291 --> 41:56.625
I'M HERE TO SEE
THE LIEUTENANT.

41:56.625 --> 41:58.417
- THAT'S ME.
IT'S GREAT TO MEET YOU.

41:58.417 --> 41:59.875
DEBRA MORGAN.

41:59.875 --> 42:02.166
- [chuckles]

42:02.166 --> 42:04.667
- WHAT'S FUNNY?
- YOU...THE LIEUTENANT.

42:04.667 --> 42:06.333
- THAT A PROBLEM?
- LISTEN.

42:06.333 --> 42:07.542
I JUST GOT OFF
A THREE-HOUR FLIGHT

42:07.542 --> 42:09.000
AND I'M REALLY TIRED,

42:09.000 --> 42:10.375
WHICH MEANS I'M NOT
IN THE MOOD

42:10.375 --> 42:12.083
FOR ANY CUTE DEPARTMENT
RAZZING.

42:12.083 --> 42:14.625
SO WILL YOU TAKE ME TO YOUR
BOSS, PLEASE?

42:14.625 --> 42:17.375
MAYBE SCORE ME SOME COFFEE
ON THE WAY, NO CREAM.

42:20.542 --> 42:21.834
- YOU LISTEN.

42:21.834 --> 42:24.208
RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE MY TOP CHOICE
FOR THIS JOB,

42:24.208 --> 42:27.041
BUT THAT CAN CHANGE
REAL FUCKING FAST.

42:27.041 --> 42:30.125
I PUT MY ASS ON THE LINE
EVEN CONSIDERING YOU,

42:30.125 --> 42:32.208
SO STOW THE ATTITUDE,

42:32.208 --> 42:33.709
OR THE ONLY JOB YOU'RE GONNA
FIND IN THIS CITY

42:33.709 --> 42:36.834
IS GUARDING A LANDFILL
AS A RENT-A-COP.

42:36.834 --> 42:38.208
- LOOK, I APOLOGIZE.

42:38.208 --> 42:40.291
I DIDN'T MEAN ANY DISRESPECT.

42:40.291 --> 42:43.041
IT'S JUST THE OTHER LIEUTENANTS
I'VE SERVED UNDER HAD, UM--

42:43.041 --> 42:44.750
- DICKS?

42:44.750 --> 42:46.709
- BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK.

42:46.709 --> 42:47.792
- TRUST ME.

42:47.792 --> 42:50.667
THIS IS JUST AS WEIRD FOR ME
AS IT IS FOR YOU.

42:50.667 --> 42:52.917
MOVING ON.

42:52.917 --> 42:55.417
LET'S TALK.

43:00.750 --> 43:03.291
- YOU KNOW, I JUST
GOT MY CAR OUT OF THE SHOP.

43:03.291 --> 43:05.291
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

43:05.291 --> 43:08.667
- THIS IS THE END, WALTER.

43:08.667 --> 43:11.250
YOU PULLED YOUR LAST TOOTH.

43:11.250 --> 43:13.250
- HOW DID I GET HERE?

43:13.250 --> 43:14.333
- SERVICE ENTRANCE.

43:14.333 --> 43:17.125
I THINK I TWEAKED MY BACK.

43:17.125 --> 43:19.667
- FUCK ME.

43:19.667 --> 43:21.417
- YOU COULD HAVE SPENT YOUR
FINAL DAYS RELAXING,

43:21.417 --> 43:26.583
ENJOYING LIFE, BUT THEN
THERE WAS ROSALIA DAVOLOS.

43:26.583 --> 43:28.417
SHE'S THE FIRST ONE
IN TEN YEARS.

43:28.417 --> 43:31.417
WASN'T SHE?
WHY NOW?

43:31.417 --> 43:34.834
- I GOT TIRED OF STARING
AT A BOX OF TEETH.

43:34.834 --> 43:36.959
TOOK ME TEN MINUTES
TO KILL THE WHORE.

43:36.959 --> 43:40.959
LOST ANOTHER 20 TRYING
TO PULL THE GODDAMN TOOTH.

43:45.750 --> 43:47.792
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

43:47.792 --> 43:51.125
IT SEEMED YOU WERE ALL
THE COUNTRY WAS TALKING ABOUT.

43:51.125 --> 43:52.417
THE TOOTH FAIRY.

43:52.417 --> 43:54.125
TOO CLEVER FOR THE POLICE.

43:54.125 --> 43:55.667
THEY COULDN'T CATCH YOU.

43:55.667 --> 43:58.792
LIKE BURT REYNOLDS
WITH HIS TRANS-AM.

43:58.792 --> 44:01.417
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
ARE THE SAME MAN

44:01.417 --> 44:04.125
THAT DUMPED A BODY AT
A DEPUTY SHERIFF'S HOUSE.

44:04.125 --> 44:05.625
- [laughs]

44:05.625 --> 44:08.375
TOTAL FUCKING ACCIDENT.

44:08.375 --> 44:10.458
I DOWNED A FEW TOO MANY...
- [sighs]

44:10.458 --> 44:12.709
- AND DIDN'T FEEL LIKE DRIVING
OUT TO THE HIGHWAY

44:12.709 --> 44:14.458
TO GET RID OF THE BITCH.

44:14.458 --> 44:16.083
- THAT'S DISAPPOINTING.

44:16.083 --> 44:19.291
- WELL, I'M VERY FUCKING SORRY
TO LET YOU DOWN.

44:19.291 --> 44:21.458
DOES THAT MEAN YOU
DON'T WANT MY AUTOGRAPH?

44:21.458 --> 44:22.709
- NO.

44:22.709 --> 44:27.458
JUST...THIS.

44:27.458 --> 44:29.250
- I--I TOOK TEETH.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.709
YOU TAKE BLOOD.

44:30.709 --> 44:33.458
YOU'RE THE SAME KIND
OF SICK FUCK, AREN'T YOU?

44:33.458 --> 44:35.250
- AT LEAST I'M NEVER GONNA
END UP LIKE YOU.

44:35.250 --> 44:36.792
- OH, YEAH?

44:36.792 --> 44:40.750
WHEN YOU CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE,
WHAT DO YOU HAVE THEN?

44:40.750 --> 44:41.667
- MORE.

44:41.667 --> 44:43.917
- YOU'RE KIDDING YOURSELF,
ASSHOLE.

44:43.917 --> 44:46.333
ALL I EVER CARED ABOUT
WAS KILLING,

44:46.333 --> 44:48.208
AND I CAN'T EVEN
DO THAT RIGHT ANYMORE.

44:48.208 --> 44:50.583
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

44:50.583 --> 44:55.375
THIS IS YOUR FUTURE AND IT
INCLUDES ADULT FUCKING DIAPERS!

44:55.375 --> 44:56.834
- YOU ARE NOT MY FUTURE.

44:56.834 --> 44:59.667
I WILL NOT SPEND MY
FINAL DAYS GETTING DRUNK

44:59.667 --> 45:01.792
AND STARING AT
A BOX OF TROPHIES.

45:01.792 --> 45:05.041
- KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT.

45:05.041 --> 45:07.667
MAKE SURE THEY KNOW WHO I AM.

45:07.667 --> 45:08.959
I WISH I COULD SEE THE LOOK

45:08.959 --> 45:11.208
ON MY SON'S FACE
WHEN HE FINDS OUT.

45:11.208 --> 45:15.000
HE WON'T BE ABLE
TO IGNORE THAT!

45:17.166 --> 45:19.959
- I NEVER WANT MY SON
TO KNOW WHO I WAS.

45:19.959 --> 45:23.041
- YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T HAVE A KID.

45:23.041 --> 45:26.000
- I ALSO SAID MY NAME
WAS "DAN."

45:29.250 --> 45:30.709
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

45:30.709 --> 45:32.709
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE
AS THE TOOTH FAIRY.

45:32.709 --> 45:35.000
YOU'RE GONNA DIE AS A SAD,
OLD MAN...

45:35.000 --> 45:36.041
OF A HEART ATTACK.

45:36.041 --> 45:37.208
- NO!

45:37.208 --> 45:38.542
[muffled screams]

45:38.542 --> 45:41.000
- THE LATEST RESIDENT
TO CHECK OUT

45:41.000 --> 45:44.041
OF THE CORAL ISLAND
RETIREMENT VILLAGE.

45:44.041 --> 45:45.500
- [muffled grunt]

46:00.917 --> 46:02.542
- WALTER KENNEY'S SON
WILL NEVER KNOW

46:02.542 --> 46:05.542
HIS FATHER WAS A MONSTER.

46:05.542 --> 46:07.542
OR AT LEAST NOT A KILLER.

46:17.333 --> 46:21.208
[ambulance radio chatter]

46:24.917 --> 46:28.542
WE ALL WANT LIFE TO HAVE SOME
KIND OF MEANING.

46:37.542 --> 46:40.250
SEEMS LIKE THE OLDER WE GET,
THE HARDER WE LOOK FOR IT...

46:40.250 --> 46:42.333
[engine revs]

46:49.125 --> 46:51.959
- [heavy moaning]

46:55.750 --> 46:59.583
- AND THE HARDER IT IS
TO FIND.

47:09.583 --> 47:14.917
AND SOME OF US JUST LOOK
IN THE WRONG PLACE.

47:23.417 --> 47:27.750
BUT IF OUR LIVES
DON'T HAVE MEANING...

47:27.750 --> 47:29.875
- HORSEY, DADDY.

47:33.291 --> 47:36.834
- WHAT CAN WE LEAVE BEHIND
FOR THOSE WE CARE ABOUT?

47:36.834 --> 47:39.959
THERE YOU GO, BUDDY.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.333
WALTER KENNEY WANTED
TO PASS ON THE UGLINESS

47:56.333 --> 47:59.041
THAT HIS LIFE HAD BECOME.

48:14.458 --> 48:17.542
WHAT WILL I PASS ON?

48:25.125 --> 48:27.000
[clattering]
AH!

48:43.208 --> 48:48.500
I DON'T KNOW WHICH SLIDE
GOES WHERE, WHO'S WHO.

48:48.500 --> 48:51.792
THERE'S NO ORDER ANYMORE.

48:51.792 --> 48:53.875
[sighs]

48:53.875 --> 48:56.875
[horse hooves galloping]
