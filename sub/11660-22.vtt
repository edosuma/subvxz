(mellow music playing)

00:58.033 --> 01:02.633
Girls, I am so excited!
I just got a big bonus at work.

01:03.633 --> 01:06.166
-Guess what I've decided to do with it.
-What?

01:06.700 --> 01:08.867
I'm going to have my breasts enlarged.

01:14.166 --> 01:17.000
-Well, you're not serious, Blanche.
-Oh, sure I am.

01:17.066 --> 01:18.667
Breasts are back in fashion.

01:20.033 --> 01:23.700
What God didn't give me,
Dr. Myron Rosenzweig will.

01:24.834 --> 01:28.533
Oh, that man is the Picasso
of plastic surgeons.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.433
Make sure he doesn't attach one
to your forehead.

01:32.033 --> 01:33.300
Yes.

01:34.767 --> 01:37.433
-Hello, what's shaking?
-Blanche's breasts.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.734
-That's why she's having them--
-Shut up, Rose.

01:43.734 --> 01:48.000
-Ma, where have you been?
-I went to see Lillian.

01:48.066 --> 01:52.500
-Lillian at Shady Pines?
-You remember Shady Pines,

01:52.567 --> 01:55.633
that retirement home you stuck me in
that resembles Sing Sing?

01:56.433 --> 01:58.533
My mistake. Sing Sing has a movie night.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.867
Sophia, how is Lillian?

02:00.934 --> 02:05.233
I walked in, and someone else
was in her bed.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.867
Lillian? Did you say Lillian?

02:08.367 --> 02:11.834
My God, you got a call about her
this morning.

02:11.900 --> 02:15.266
I was so caught up in my breasts,
I totally forgot.

02:16.834 --> 02:18.834
It happens to all of us, Blanche.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.734
That's why my rent check was late.

02:23.300 --> 02:28.166
It's from Gladys at Shady Pines.
Lillian was sent to Sunny Pastures.

02:28.233 --> 02:30.734
See, Ma, your friend's fine.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.700
Fine? Sunny pastures is the worst nursing
home in the city.

02:34.767 --> 02:38.467
It's every old person's nightmare,
that and the childproof cap

02:38.533 --> 02:40.200
on the kaopectate bottle.

02:42.433 --> 02:46.233
If it's licensed by the state,
Lillian will be fine.

02:46.300 --> 02:50.767
It's where people wind up
when they can't afford Shady Pines.

02:50.834 --> 02:52.433
It's the bottom of the barrel.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.333
I have to see if Lillian's okay.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.934
If it'll make you feel better,
I'll take you.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.066
Oh, good.

03:00.133 --> 03:04.967
Now, while we're there, you promise
you'll hold my hand the entire time?

03:05.033 --> 03:07.667
Ma, are you really that scared?

03:07.734 --> 03:12.433
No, I just want to make sure you're not
grabbing at brochures behind my back.

03:15.767 --> 03:20.300
(serene music playing)

03:20.800 --> 03:22.066
(door opens)

03:22.567 --> 03:24.166
Rose, hi.

03:24.233 --> 03:27.567
I just picked up these pamphlets
at a cosmetic surgeon.

03:27.633 --> 03:30.934
Help me decide which alterations I'll get.

03:34.700 --> 03:37.367
None of these women have any tops on!

03:38.033 --> 03:42.000
I know, honey. These are the "after"
pictures of satisfied customers.

03:42.066 --> 03:45.433
I was thinking about having mine
done like hers.

03:46.700 --> 03:50.100
All right, Blanche,
but do you think black really suits you?

03:57.467 --> 03:59.367
I was talking about the shape.

03:59.633 --> 04:05.867
See, these are regal, dignified, upscale,
and 50% off.

04:07.567 --> 04:10.900
Dr. Rosenzweig over ordered
on the Vixen III model.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.633
Are you sure you're not being a bit silly?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Why?

04:16.734 --> 04:18.066
Let me tell you something.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.667
When I was a schoolgirl,
I developed early.

04:21.734 --> 04:24.400
All the boys noticed and hit on me.

04:24.767 --> 04:27.767
Not one boy was ever
interested in my mind.

04:33.567 --> 04:34.834
Get out of here.

04:36.533 --> 04:38.133
It's true!

04:38.200 --> 04:40.600
But you, Blanche, I mean,
men are drawn to you

04:40.667 --> 04:44.500
because of your charm, and your wit,
and your zest for life,

04:44.567 --> 04:46.500
I mean, you can have
the operation or not,

04:46.567 --> 04:49.166
men won't care one bit
about your breasts.

04:49.233 --> 04:51.767
-Really, Rose?
-Not with me around.

04:55.967 --> 04:58.500
(Blanche) Oh, hi, girls.
Did you find Lillian?

04:58.567 --> 04:59.834
You bet we did.

05:00.333 --> 05:03.700
Sunny pastures was everything
ma said it would be.

05:03.767 --> 05:07.367
There was crud on the floor,
rats in the hallway,

05:07.433 --> 05:11.233
60 people to a blanket.
It wasn't fit for humans.

05:12.233 --> 05:15.433
Although in my village in Sicily,
it would have been two-star motel.

05:17.233 --> 05:20.767
Ma, you're exaggerating...
but not by much.

05:20.834 --> 05:22.800
It was pretty bad.

05:22.867 --> 05:26.800
A horrible story like that,
brings up so many questions.

05:26.867 --> 05:30.667
It does. Why do things like this happen?

05:31.066 --> 05:34.567
Why can't we care for our elderly
like the Japanese do?

05:34.934 --> 05:38.166
Why are 17 sets of hooters
on the coffee table?

05:47.667 --> 05:49.400
Those are mine, Sophia.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.767
Well, let me put on my big surprise face.

05:54.667 --> 05:58.700
I wish there was something we could do
for the poor thing.

05:58.767 --> 06:02.600
There is.
I want to adopt Lillian, visit her often.

06:02.867 --> 06:05.867
-I'll need rides.
-Count on us, sweetheart.

06:05.934 --> 06:08.100
-You can.
-Absolutely.

06:08.433 --> 06:10.834
Come on, it's getting late.
Let's get dinner.

06:12.033 --> 06:14.967
Notice how they seem to follow you
wherever you go?

06:27.133 --> 06:32.133
(mellow music playing)

06:38.667 --> 06:40.133
This is it, Sophia?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.834
This doesn't seem so bad.

06:43.100 --> 06:46.934
You have to get into it
before you realize how bad it really is...

06:47.467 --> 06:49.567
just like <i>War and Remembrance.</i>

06:52.367 --> 06:55.100
Excuse me, ladies,
visiting hours are over.

06:55.166 --> 06:58.300
-We'll just come back.
-We're not here to visit.

06:58.567 --> 07:02.200
-We're not?
-We're here to see about checking in mom.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.300
You two are sisters?

07:08.767 --> 07:12.367
Uh, it's a long, involved,
and somewhat sordid story.

07:12.433 --> 07:16.734
If you want a clearer picture,
rent the cassette of <i>Chinatown.</i>

07:19.200 --> 07:22.533
-Sophia, what's going on?
-It's a little surprise.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.834
We're not visiting Lillian.
We're breaking her out.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.100
What?

07:27.367 --> 07:31.033
We can't do that. That's wrong.
Suppose we get caught?

07:31.100 --> 07:34.533
Lillian's a great friend.
Will you do it, please?

07:35.333 --> 07:36.600
Well, okay.

07:36.667 --> 07:39.433
I'll keep the staff busy, you get Lillian.

07:41.066 --> 07:44.400
She's down the hall,
last door on the right. Go!

07:45.800 --> 07:49.834
Hello. I'm John Porter.
I'm in charge of admissions.

07:49.900 --> 07:53.400
Hi. I wanted to talk to you
about my mother.

07:53.467 --> 07:54.500
About checking her in?

07:54.567 --> 07:57.066
No. About her collection
of commemorative plates.

07:58.300 --> 07:59.967
Of course about checking her in.

08:00.467 --> 08:02.333
Uh, she's 125.

08:03.734 --> 08:06.066
You can't pry the yogurt from her hands.

08:06.133 --> 08:08.800
I'll get the papers from my office.

08:11.133 --> 08:12.667
Okay, Sophia. Let's go.

08:13.166 --> 08:15.367
Go where? That's not Lillian.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.367
You said you were Lillian.

08:19.433 --> 08:22.934
You think I'm in here
because I'm good with names?

08:24.767 --> 08:27.400
Rose, try again. She's in bed 6A.

08:27.667 --> 08:29.533
-Now, hurry.
-Come on.

08:30.700 --> 08:34.233
Okay. Let's fill this out. Uh, please.

08:35.233 --> 08:37.233
Um... and you are...

08:37.300 --> 08:39.967
Sophia. Sophia pe-- Hawkins.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.400
Okay, Mrs. Pehawkins, um...

08:46.166 --> 08:48.600
maybe you could tell me
something about your mother's history.

08:48.667 --> 08:52.033
Picture it. Sicily, 1900.

08:52.834 --> 08:55.834
An olive-skinned woman sets sail
for the new world.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.333
Tell me about her medical history.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.834
I was. You think
that was a pleasure cruise?

09:02.533 --> 09:05.967
There was smallpox, scurvy, typhoid...

09:06.433 --> 09:08.100
and that was business class.

09:09.066 --> 09:13.333
I need to know if your mother requires
special medical care.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.533
She does. Uh... an old war injury.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.767
Remember the <i>Maine?</i>
She didn't.

09:21.166 --> 09:24.667
She was a frogman
and swam right into the bulkhead.

09:25.467 --> 09:28.934
They put a metal plate in her head.
Now she gets HBO through her eyeballs.

09:32.166 --> 09:33.433
Don't look at me like that.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.367
If Tyson fights again,
use her in the rec hall.

09:37.734 --> 09:39.633
It's all hard to believe.

09:39.700 --> 09:43.300
If it's not true,
my name isn't Sophia Pehawkins.

09:45.633 --> 09:47.700
-(telephone rings)
-Excuse me.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.834
Rose, what the hell is going on?

10:01.300 --> 10:04.700
I want Lillian,
you bring me Eubie Blake's parents.

10:04.767 --> 10:05.867
What's wrong?

10:05.934 --> 10:08.133
They were the only
other people back there.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.667
There is no way Lillian is in this ward.

10:11.133 --> 10:17.200
-Hi, Sophia. What are you doing here?
-Lillian, thank God I found you!

10:17.266 --> 10:20.066
-I'm taking you away from here.
-You are?

10:20.133 --> 10:23.767
-How? What about them?
-(Sophia) Leave it to a pro.

10:28.767 --> 10:31.467
Runaway wheelchair!

10:36.200 --> 10:38.333
Wait a minute! Come back here!

10:42.133 --> 10:47.467
(serene music playing)

10:47.834 --> 10:50.667
How was your appointment
with Dr. Rosenzweig?

10:50.734 --> 10:52.333
I was so nervous.

10:52.400 --> 10:57.033
I rushed right in, pulled off my top,
and said, "well, what do you think?"

10:59.300 --> 11:00.567
What did he say?

11:00.633 --> 11:04.900
He said, "I think you're probably looking
for Dr. Rosenzweig..."

11:08.900 --> 11:12.467
"But if you ever want a discount
on life insurance, call me."

11:15.667 --> 11:18.934
-Boy, do I need a cup of coffee.
-What's the matter?

11:19.000 --> 11:22.400
This whole Lillian thing.
The woman was up all night.

11:22.467 --> 11:26.000
-Ma is exhausted.
-This is all my fault.

11:26.066 --> 11:28.700
Don't worry about it.

11:28.767 --> 11:32.834
I called the home and checked her out
for a week's visit,

11:32.900 --> 11:37.233
so we're not kidnappers anymore.
Ma, sit down.

11:37.600 --> 11:41.767
-Ma, we need to talk about Lillian.
-I'll take care of her,

11:41.834 --> 11:43.767
along with you three.

11:43.834 --> 11:48.333
I'll do a little more cleaning
and cooking, make up one more bed.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.467
You don't make my bed.

11:50.533 --> 11:52.934
I know. It's impossible
to put a fitted sheet

11:53.000 --> 11:55.066
around a big, hairy guy named Ed.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.900
Hello, everyone.
Isn't it a lovely morning?

12:01.967 --> 12:04.767
It sure is, sweetheart.
How about some pancakes?

12:04.834 --> 12:10.500
-Again? We had pancakes yesterday.
-Lillian, you weren't here yesterday.

12:11.033 --> 12:12.834
Here you are. A nice cup of tea.

12:12.900 --> 12:17.000
Sophia tells me you were
in the Ziegfeld follies.

12:17.066 --> 12:20.433
Oh, yes. Those were the days.

12:20.500 --> 12:24.033
-Bet you were something.
-I was quite a looker.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.166
(Blanche) Oh!

12:25.934 --> 12:30.700
-Almost as pretty as you.
-Why, thank you.

12:30.767 --> 12:33.567
Of course, I had bigger breasts.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.867
Sophia, could I take a bath
before breakfast?

12:44.934 --> 12:46.800
-It's been a while.
-Here, let me help.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.066
She's my friend. I want to help her.

12:51.233 --> 12:54.166
Isn't it wonderful to think about?

12:54.233 --> 12:57.066
The two of them together,
and they're so cute.

12:57.133 --> 13:00.200
You're thinking about your breasts again,
aren't you?

13:01.333 --> 13:02.500
(crash)

13:05.233 --> 13:08.533
-I don't know this place.
-Lillian, it... it's okay.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.800
And I don't know you.

13:13.166 --> 13:19.033
Lillian, I'm Dorothy. And this is Sophia.
We're your friends.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.333
We brought you here
from the home yesterday.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.433
Oh, okay. Right. I'm sorry.

13:24.867 --> 13:28.300
Now why don't you go take that nice,
hot bath?

13:28.367 --> 13:29.700
Come on.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.900
-Why not sit this one out?
-I can't handle it?

13:33.967 --> 13:39.166
Like it's too much for poor old Sophia?
I'm so ancient I don't have the energy?

13:39.233 --> 13:40.834
Get the lights.

13:43.100 --> 13:47.533
(calm music playing)

13:50.400 --> 13:52.400
Well, I guess it's my shift.

13:52.467 --> 13:54.934
It's okay, Dorothy.
I think she's finally asleep.

13:55.033 --> 13:57.500
Oh, thank God. I'm exhausted.

13:57.567 --> 14:00.166
Haven't been this tired
since my wedding night.

14:02.066 --> 14:05.667
A night of unbridled passion
will do you in.

14:05.734 --> 14:07.667
Who said anything about passion?

14:08.166 --> 14:12.300
I was tired from picking up beer cans
from Stan's poker buddies.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.700
I cannot believe Lillian's only been
here 24 hours.

14:17.767 --> 14:21.367
I cannot believe ma thought
she could handle her alone.

14:21.433 --> 14:25.700
-It's almost too much for us four.
-This makes me mad.

14:25.767 --> 14:27.834
People like this need help.

14:28.233 --> 14:30.567
Then there are places like Sunny Pastures.

14:30.633 --> 14:33.533
Well, there weren't any
Sunny Pastures in the south.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.367
At least not when I was growing up.

14:35.433 --> 14:39.300
I remember this one old man.
His name was Ben.

14:39.367 --> 14:43.700
All he did all day long was sit out there
on his family's front porch,

14:43.767 --> 14:46.567
in that old hickory rocking chair,
and whittle.

14:46.633 --> 14:48.266
Just whittle.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.300
I used to pass by there
on my way home from school

14:51.367 --> 14:53.100
and I'd say, "hi, Ben."

14:53.166 --> 14:57.300
And he'd yell back, "hi, Blanche.
Stay away from my grandsons."

14:59.500 --> 15:02.533
Anyway, I realized that Ben
could spend all his days

15:02.600 --> 15:05.800
happy whittling away because
his family was there for him.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.767
I will never forget that look on his face.

15:08.834 --> 15:13.166
He was happier than a Kentucky yearling
frolicking in bluegrass

15:13.233 --> 15:16.200
as high as a hoot owl's perch
on the top of--

15:16.266 --> 15:21.133
-In English, Jethro, in English.
-He was happy.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.467
Anyway, Ben got older
and I guess a little bit frail, and...

15:28.467 --> 15:30.066
this is the hard part of my story.

15:31.300 --> 15:35.000
One autumn day I walked by that porch
and old Ben was gone.

15:38.233 --> 15:40.800
I bet he died in the bed
he was born in.

15:42.266 --> 15:46.033
No, he was sent up the river
on a morals charge.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.834
Are you okay, Sophia?
You're awfully quiet.

15:54.900 --> 15:59.834
It's just that talking about Lillian
makes me think about the future.

15:59.900 --> 16:03.834
Oh, Ma, honey, you have nothing to worry
about.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.934
Who said I was talking about my future?

16:07.367 --> 16:10.133
You three aren't exactly spring chickens,
you know.

16:11.834 --> 16:17.033
She's right. One way or another,
we're all in the same boat.

16:17.100 --> 16:21.633
But now our problem is Lillian.
We can't take care of her.

16:21.700 --> 16:26.100
Sunny Pastures isn't doing its job.
What will we do?

16:26.166 --> 16:30.300
I know what I'll do,
make Sunny Pastures do its job.

16:30.367 --> 16:37.166
I'll see the man who runs that place.
I can be mean and tough when I want to.

16:37.233 --> 16:39.333
-I'll need one thing.
-What, Dorothy?

16:39.400 --> 16:41.300
My mother to come with me.

16:44.400 --> 16:49.700
(serene music playing)

16:50.367 --> 16:53.467
No. The purchase order's right here.

16:53.533 --> 16:57.133
This was your mistake,
and we're not paying for it.

16:57.967 --> 17:01.967
Problems, problems, problems,
the world is bringing me problems,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.133
-and you are?
-We are the world.

17:12.166 --> 17:16.400
I'm Dorothy Zbornak,
this is my mother, Sophia. We're here to--

17:16.467 --> 17:18.900
-(telephone rings)
-Hello.

17:19.834 --> 17:25.367
No. No, I did not order 40 fry pans.
It was 40 bedpans.

17:26.800 --> 17:27.800
(slams down phone)

17:27.867 --> 17:30.734
-I'm sorry. You were saying?
-What we wanted to talk--

17:30.800 --> 17:33.734
-(telephone rings)
-Sorry. Hello.

17:34.467 --> 17:38.300
Good. Tell them to drop it
at the loading dock. Right.

17:38.367 --> 17:42.800
I'm so sorry. It's always like this.
You were saying?

17:46.767 --> 17:50.600
-Uh, Mrs. Zbornak?
-Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17:50.667 --> 17:55.233
I figured if I opened my mouth,
the phone would start ringing.

17:56.834 --> 18:00.767
-Anyway, what I--
-(telephone rings)

18:01.567 --> 18:03.033
I'll let it ring.

18:04.467 --> 18:08.500
We're here because
our dear friend's a patient here,

18:08.567 --> 18:10.500
and we have some concerns.

18:10.567 --> 18:14.667
She's a lovely woman, very sweet and kind.

18:14.734 --> 18:18.734
And we would hope that in some way,
you know, you could...

18:19.266 --> 18:21.500
-(telephone ringing continues)
-Damn it! Answer it!

18:23.367 --> 18:24.767
Uh-huh.

18:25.734 --> 18:29.133
Bill the insurance company first.
The state handles the rest.

18:30.433 --> 18:33.600
So you have some concerns
about Sunny Pastures?

18:33.667 --> 18:35.834
Actually, they're more like complaints.

18:35.900 --> 18:41.533
Complaints. What you need to do
is fill out these forms.

18:41.600 --> 18:45.266
-Then what?
-Then it goes right here.

18:45.533 --> 18:47.200
This is outrageous.

18:47.266 --> 18:51.333
Lillian's problems cannot wait that long.
She is old, she is sick,

18:51.400 --> 18:53.934
and she needs better care now.

18:55.233 --> 18:57.133
-I agree.
-What?

18:57.200 --> 19:02.500
Look, ladies, Sunny Pastures
doesn't operate at a profit.

19:02.834 --> 19:07.100
Our patients' social security
and Medicare pay most of our bills.

19:07.367 --> 19:11.467
Government subsidies pick up the slack,
so we'll meet minimum standards.

19:11.533 --> 19:14.200
Then maybe minimum standards
aren't enough.

19:14.266 --> 19:17.300
Right again, and this year
the government's made cutbacks.

19:17.367 --> 19:20.066
We're operating in the red.

19:20.133 --> 19:26.667
-Are you saying that nothing can be done?
-Look, I'd love to help your friend.

19:26.734 --> 19:28.834
I'd love to help all our patients.

19:28.900 --> 19:33.233
If you have ideas on
how to make it better, I'm all ears.

19:35.133 --> 19:38.800
(telephone rings)

19:43.433 --> 19:44.600
Hello.

19:45.266 --> 19:50.233
(calm music playing)

19:51.133 --> 19:53.066
-How did it go?
-Terrible.

19:54.367 --> 19:59.633
I can't believe you live 80, 90 years and
wind up in a place like Sunny Pastures.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.800
I guess money makes the world go round.

20:03.867 --> 20:08.467
You live 90 years, getting up too fast
makes the world go round.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.200
Hi, everyone.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.400
Where's Lillian?
I have some really good news.

20:16.467 --> 20:19.934
-She's napping. What news?
-I was going around town,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.333
and I think I've found the perfect place.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.467
-Really?
-It's not as nice as Shady Pines,

20:25.533 --> 20:29.700
but the staff cares,
and the patients are happy.

20:29.767 --> 20:31.900
Rose, that is fantastic.

20:31.967 --> 20:34.800
And it won't cost any more
than Sunny Pastures?

20:34.867 --> 20:37.133
Well, that's the one little problem.

20:37.834 --> 20:42.667
Lillian's benefits won't cover the cost.
She'll need another 150 a month.

20:43.166 --> 20:44.433
Little problem?

20:44.500 --> 20:46.967
Rose, how could you get our hopes up
like that?

20:47.033 --> 20:50.233
I mean, who has an extra $150 a month?

20:51.467 --> 20:52.600
I do.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.834
-What?
-I do.

20:56.300 --> 20:59.233
We'll use that bonus check
I got at work.

20:59.567 --> 21:02.900
-Blanche, you--
-Don't try to talk me out of it.

21:02.967 --> 21:04.133
You sure?

21:04.200 --> 21:07.066
Sure. Lillian ought
to be covered for two years

21:07.133 --> 21:09.300
with that money in my bosom account.

21:13.433 --> 21:17.700
Blanche, I'm proud of you,
but why this sudden change of heart?

21:17.767 --> 21:23.100
Well, I guess this cosmetic surgery
business is pretty trivial, really.

21:23.166 --> 21:25.600
I'll do fine with what God gave me.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.667
Having Lillian here made me realize
that my problems are pretty trite.

21:30.734 --> 21:34.834
I suppose something like this
does make your breasts seem rather small.

21:44.734 --> 21:46.133
Well, sort of.

21:47.166 --> 21:51.200
That's that. Lillian's problems
are solved. Isn't this terrific?

21:51.266 --> 21:56.000
Terrific? Ma, this is wonderful.
I mean, this is a real happy ending.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.800
So how come I don't feel all that happy?

22:02.834 --> 22:03.900
I don't know.

22:04.333 --> 22:07.066
Is it because we know
that Lillian's just lucky,

22:07.133 --> 22:11.133
that lots of old people slip through
the cracks and are forgotten?

22:12.266 --> 22:18.000
And maybe it may not be too long
until we're elderly ourselves?

22:19.066 --> 22:20.633
(Rose) I know, girls...

22:20.700 --> 22:24.367
let's make a pact,
that we'll always take care of each other

22:24.433 --> 22:28.166
-and never desert each other.
-You can count on me.

22:28.233 --> 22:31.400
You think it'll be that easy
getting rid of me?

22:32.100 --> 22:34.000
That was rhetorical, Rose.

22:35.867 --> 22:40.400
Ah, but what a comforting thought,
knowing you'll never be alone.

22:40.467 --> 22:41.533
Listen, what the hell?

22:41.600 --> 22:45.667
If we have to go to a nursing home,
let's all go together.

22:49.734 --> 22:52.433
What happens
when there's only one of us left?

22:55.233 --> 22:57.033
I'll take care of myself.

23:09.467 --> 23:14.300
(theme music playing)
