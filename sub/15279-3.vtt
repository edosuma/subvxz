[John] My sister is a good person.

01:48.901 --> 01:53.489
She takes care of people.
She wants everyone to be happy.

01:57.827 --> 02:01.998
But when our brother came home,
that was impossible.

for her to make everyone happy.

Hey.

04:08.124 --> 04:09.500
I'm heading out.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.669
- Where are you going?
- I told you.

04:11.877 --> 04:15.464
I'm working surveillance tonight.
What are you doing up?

04:15.881 --> 04:19.093
Oh, it's so hot.
I can't sleep. My AC's out.

04:22.847 --> 04:24.890
- What?
- Nothing.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.644
- No, really. What?
- You said "my" AC.

04:29.687 --> 04:33.440
I didn't mean anything by that.
I just meant that it's my place, so...

04:33.899 --> 04:35.609
Yeah. That's the thing.

04:35.818 --> 04:38.946
There's a "your place,"
and there's a "my place."

Which hasn't bothered me,
but with your dad in the hospital, I--

is my father too.

- but Mom wants him.
- [Kevin] I'm fine. Okay.

I have given enough energy to Danny.

- You don't care?
- [Kevin] Nope.

12:54.065 --> 12:57.986

- Yeah. Well, maybe I shouldn't have.

If Danny stays,
what is he going to do here?

13:02.407 --> 13:04.826

We'll have to figure something out.

You make these decisions
and then come to us afterwards.

- It'd be nice if you asked us first.
- Mom wanted him home.

- Dad didn't.
- Well, Dad left the decision up to us,

13:23.136 --> 13:26.765
and I'm sorry, but if I recall correctly,
you were fine with Danny staying.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.266
That was before.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.977
Dad's in the hospital now.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.773
Listen. All I'm saying is we need
to think about things differently.

13:34.981 --> 13:38.151
Clearly, the doctors don't have
any idea how this is gonna end up,

13:38.360 --> 13:39.861
and we need to be prepared.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.697
Prepared for what?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.490
When Dad comes home from the hospital,

13:43.699 --> 13:47.244
Dad may not be able to do the things
around here he used to be able to do.

Dad's responsibilities?

everything he does.

I know what Dad does.
I do his legal work.

13:59.757 --> 14:01.675
I probably know more than you.

Well, good. Then you know Mom
can't run things here on her own.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.098
It's not a bad idea to have a plan, Meg.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.850
What? Why are we having this conversation?

14:12.143 --> 14:13.228
What does the will say?

14:14.896 --> 14:16.189
- You fucking kidding?
- [Kevin] Relax.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.609
- We're gonna talk about his will?
- [Kevin] Just asking.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.570
Did Mom and Dad ever talk about
what they'd do if one of them--

14:21.779 --> 14:22.862
No. Never.

14:23.071 --> 14:26.950
Mom never wanted to talk about it.
She left it to me and Dad, and Dad--

14:27.576 --> 14:28.910
Dad what?

14:29.119 --> 14:30.412
Nothing. It's irrelevant.

14:30.621 --> 14:33.624
The will says nothing about running this
if something happens to Dad.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.960
- And nothing about Danny taking over.
- We're just asking a question.

14:37.168 --> 14:40.338
I gotta go.
Let me know what Danny decides.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.592
- Meg.
- [Meg] I'm late. I gotta go.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.928
[Eric] I might have another job
for us next week.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.973
Yeah. You're gonna
have to do it without me.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.601
Well, it's gonna be
a biggie payday, maybe.

14:52.810 --> 14:55.312
- John's watching.
- John's always fucking watching.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.896
So what?

14:57.105 --> 15:00.984
- You know?
- No. Sorry. I'm out. I'm out.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.361
Come on.

15:11.662 --> 15:12.871
[Chelsea] Nice wheels.

15:13.622 --> 15:17.000
- [Danny] I borrowed them from my brother.
- I thought you were leaving town.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.419
A couple of things to do.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.630
I was afraid we wouldn't get
a chance to play together.

15:21.797 --> 15:23.256
[Danny] Mm-hm.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.718
- Oh, careful. Careful.
- Ah. [laughs]

15:29.721 --> 15:31.181
John came by here yesterday.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.851
Oh, yeah? What'd you tell him?

15:34.976 --> 15:36.770
I told him you spent the night.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.314
Anything else?

15:39.606 --> 15:42.901
What else could I tell him?
I don't know what you boys are up to.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.905
[laughs] Who says we're up to anything?

15:47.489 --> 15:49.491
You boys are always up to something.

15:52.703 --> 15:54.705
That's what makes you so fun.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.710
I'm gonna need this back.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.590
I heard your dad's in the hospital.
Sorry about that.

16:08.886 --> 16:09.928
Thanks, Cece.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.972
No one calls me that anymore.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.476
Better not leave town
without saying goodbye.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.144
[Danny] Mm.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.851
Since you were here last month,
I've filed requests

16:58.059 --> 17:01.104
for impact studies
and the full battery of permits.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.981
Oh, good.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.609
I've compiled a comprehensive
calendar to fulfill

17:05.817 --> 17:09.863
- federal, state and county regulations.
- Okay. How's everything looking?

17:10.071 --> 17:13.283
County's our biggest problem.
The Keys is a specialized ecosystem.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.493
The development board
is very protective.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.121
The Moros Group is sensitive
to environmental impact.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.123
Mr. Moros insists on it.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.793
- Where is Mr. Moros?
- [man] He's running a bit late.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.335
Prerogative of the boss.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.923
- Should we wait?
- He said to get started without him.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.634
Okay. So assuming we comply
with all of this,

17:30.842 --> 17:33.470
are we good,
or are we gonna have some surprises?

17:33.678 --> 17:37.181
This is the Keys,
and you're developing a major resort.

17:37.975 --> 17:41.269
I'd be doing you a disservice
if I said it was gonna be smooth sailing.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.772
- Great.
- The board's gonna debate.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.650
They'll flip-flop a thousand times
before any decision.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.820
- I'm sure we can sweeten the pot.
- It's not about money.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.571
It's always about money.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.824
Okay. It's not only about money.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.409
My family's in
the hospitality business.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.620
My father helped create
these regulations.

17:58.829 --> 18:01.414
They're actually designed
to discourage development.

18:01.623 --> 18:02.666
[knocking on door]

18:02.833 --> 18:05.418
- Hey, everybody.
- Alec. Join us.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.964
I'm sorry I'm late. I-- Traffic.

18:09.172 --> 18:13.384
Yeah. With the one road, you know?
Kind of have to plan ahead.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.095
I'm finding that out.
Good to see you, Miss Rayburn.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.556
Please, continue.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

18:18.640 --> 18:23.061
- Meg was talking us through compliance.
- Fantastic. I love compliance. Bring it.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.148
Should we start with federal
and work our way through?

18:27.231 --> 18:28.692
[Susannah] Good.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.490
[EKG beeping]

18:39.243 --> 18:41.245
[weather reporter talking on TV]

18:44.666 --> 18:48.503
- What is it you're trying to do?
- I'm trying to turn it off.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.213
It's hot. I get it.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.465
It's been hot here
going on a thousand years.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.385
Mom, I think you need
to take a break for a while. Go home.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.554
No. I'm fine.

18:57.762 --> 19:00.223
No. Sleep in your own bed,
take a shower.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.225
Meg's bringing me everything I need.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.978
Come on. Let me cook for you.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.688
Come on.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.523
Come on.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.567
Come on. I'll cook you dinner.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.610
- [Sally] Okay.
- Okay?

19:12.819 --> 19:15.113
- Come on. Okay?
- Okay.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.658
[Alec] Miss Rayburn.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.452
Can I talk to you for a second?

19:24.915 --> 19:27.000
I just wanna say thanks.

19:27.208 --> 19:30.087
With what's going on with your dad,
I thought you might cancel.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.337
So thank you.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.340
Well, you all flew down.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.134
How's he doing?

19:36.885 --> 19:38.469
He's stable.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.055
I'm gonna go visit him now.

19:40.263 --> 19:43.391
Well, look.
If you ever wanna take a break,

19:43.641 --> 19:45.060
come to New York.

19:45.268 --> 19:48.396
I'll send a plane down.
I'll make it easy for you.

19:48.939 --> 19:50.440
Thank you.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.275
I have to stay here right now.

19:52.776 --> 19:53.902
Yeah.

19:54.111 --> 19:56.195
For your family. I get it.

19:56.404 --> 19:59.407
It's a standing offer for whenever.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.118
I leave tomorrow, so...

20:02.368 --> 20:03.536
I know.

20:08.249 --> 20:09.542
What are you doing tonight?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.297
[people speaking indistinctly]

20:41.908 --> 20:43.743
[Sally] You've outdone yourself, Danny.

20:43.952 --> 20:48.372
[Danny] Thanks. Maybe I'm a little rusty.
[Kevin] Come on, man. This looks great.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.374
Really. Yum.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.293
[Danny] It's good, huh?

20:54.045 --> 20:56.756
- Hey, Mom. There are some-- Here.
- [Kevin] Thank you.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.968
--practical things we should
probably talk about.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.680
[Sally] Okay.

21:03.888 --> 21:06.432
Have you thought about
how you're gonna run things here,

21:06.516 --> 21:08.476
with dad being
in the hospital and all?

21:08.977 --> 21:12.396
Well, I guess we're just
gonna have to rely on the staff.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.857
And Danny's gonna help out.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.694
So does that mean you're staying?

21:17.902 --> 21:19.278
[Danny] Yeah. Looks like it.

21:20.197 --> 21:22.073
I didn't know
you'd made your decision.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.242
- Mama and I, we talked it over.
- [Sally] Yeah.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.870
He's gonna take over
your father's charters.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.246
[Danny] Snorkeling trips.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.082
Otherwise, we'll end up
canceling all the time.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.251
Yeah. No, that's a good idea.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.585
Where will you live?

21:34.669 --> 21:36.880
[Sally] Well, he'll stay
in the guest room.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.506
For now.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.926
You're gonna be living here too?

21:43.178 --> 21:44.470
Yeah.

21:48.266 --> 21:49.600
Is that okay?

21:50.185 --> 21:52.520
Yeah. It's great.

22:00.195 --> 22:02.530
I don't know how I feel
about Danny doing charters.

22:02.739 --> 22:06.617
I guess he's gotta do something, right?
It's probably best he stays busy.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.246
- Blue Parrot?
- I can't.

22:09.453 --> 22:12.373
- Don't you have a wife to go home to?
- Yeah-- Please.

22:12.582 --> 22:15.043
I-- Okay. I need to drink.

22:15.252 --> 22:16.294
I, uh--

22:16.502 --> 22:19.547
I got some stuff going on.

22:19.756 --> 22:20.840
Please, just one drink.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.800
- Yeah. Of course.
- Thanks.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.303
- [Meg] Sure.
- Okay. I'll meet you there.

22:40.902 --> 22:42.612
- [Alec on phone] Hey.
- Hey.

22:43.321 --> 22:44.655
I'm just getting here.

22:44.864 --> 22:45.907
Is everything okay?

22:46.950 --> 22:48.159
[beep]

22:49.286 --> 22:50.703
I can't meet you tonight.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.207
Okay.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.126
I leave for New York in the morning.

22:56.584 --> 23:00.546
I know. I'm sorry. But I gotta--
I gotta go meet my brother for a drink.

23:00.755 --> 23:03.466
Yeah, no. Of course. I-- I understand.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.593
Probably for the best anyway. Right?

23:05.802 --> 23:08.387
I mean, it is for the best.

23:09.264 --> 23:10.307
Probably.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.933
How long you gonna be gone?

23:12.142 --> 23:14.560
- Mister?
- Oh, I gotta go.

23:14.769 --> 23:16.354
Night.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.107
What's up?

23:20.317 --> 23:23.194
Uh, can you take Mom
to the hospital tomorrow?

23:23.402 --> 23:25.571
She wants to drive,
but I don't think it's safe.

23:25.863 --> 23:26.906
Why can't you do it?

23:28.616 --> 23:30.034
I'm doing the charter.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.120
Oh. That's right.

23:32.287 --> 23:34.580
Uh-- Yeah. I can do it.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.004
- Shit.
- Here you go.

23:41.212 --> 23:42.588
- [Meg] No. I got it.
- No. It's okay.

23:42.797 --> 23:44.590
[Meg] It's not a big deal.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.764
Well, okay.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.266
[Meg] Thank you.

23:54.517 --> 23:57.395
Tell Mom that I will be here
in the morning.

23:57.854 --> 23:59.397
Yeah.

24:04.527 --> 24:07.488
[car drives away]

24:07.655 --> 24:09.407
[cell phone ringing]

24:09.573 --> 24:11.201
Shit.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.119
[continues ringing]

24:13.452 --> 24:16.164
[John] Meg was happy
when Danny came home.

24:16.914 --> 24:19.750
All she ever wanted
was to include him.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.213
Make him feel part of the family.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.301
[phone continues ringing]

24:41.856 --> 24:45.109
But what she really wanted
was to fix the past...

24:45.902 --> 24:48.487
to make up for what was lost.

24:49.572 --> 24:51.490
To make us all forget.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.452
But she couldn't.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.330
Because as smart as she is...

24:58.039 --> 25:00.666
no one can change the past.

25:04.128 --> 25:05.338
[rock music playing over speakers]

25:05.422 --> 25:07.798
- [Meg] That's awful. When did it happen?
- Few weeks ago.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.718
- She kicked you out?
- Sleeping at the boatyard.

25:10.927 --> 25:13.179
I didn't notice.
You seemed fine this weekend.

25:13.388 --> 25:17.308
All an act. Well, for her, anyway.
Don't tell anybody. Okay?

25:17.516 --> 25:19.852
- No, of course not.
- I don't want people knowing.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.772
With Dad sick in the hospital,
I don't want people knowing.

25:22.939 --> 25:24.982
What happened between you guys?

25:25.191 --> 25:26.650
Um...

25:27.902 --> 25:29.737
She had a miscarriage
about a year ago.

25:29.946 --> 25:32.365
- [Meg] What? No.
- It's okay. It's okay.

25:32.573 --> 25:35.785
And I guess things
kind of went to shit after that.

25:35.993 --> 25:38.662
I wanted to try again,
you know, right away.

25:38.871 --> 25:42.459
But she said that she did not think
I was ready to become a father.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.211
- Why?
- Um...

25:45.420 --> 25:47.338
She says I need to grow up.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.757
I'm too social, I'm too loud.

25:49.966 --> 25:52.427
I drink too much. I have a temper.

25:56.306 --> 25:58.599
I see you agree with her.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.310
- No.
- [laughs] Yeah. You do.

26:00.518 --> 26:01.936
No. I think she has a point,

26:02.145 --> 26:05.148
but I also think she kind of knew
that when she married you.

26:05.356 --> 26:06.983
Yeah.

26:10.069 --> 26:14.157
So I'm just trying to chill out
about the whole Danny thing, you know?

26:14.615 --> 26:15.992
Just play it cool.

26:19.537 --> 26:22.248
How do you and Marco
keep it together?

26:23.124 --> 26:26.336
You guys are, like,
the best couple I know.

26:26.544 --> 26:27.878
Oh, we have problems too.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.174
No, you-- You always seem so
relaxed around each other, you know?

26:31.382 --> 26:32.675
Like--

26:33.551 --> 26:35.845
I guess the secret is don't get married.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.682
Maybe.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.280
[Danny] I thought you were going
to the hospital.

26:54.489 --> 26:55.698
Meg's waiting in the car.

26:55.906 --> 26:59.618
I just wanted to check in with you
before I left. Got everything you need?

26:59.827 --> 27:01.120
[Danny] Yeah. Looks like it.

27:01.329 --> 27:02.830
Well, you've got a group of six.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.416
Father and son
and two sets of newlyweds.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.751
They'll be divorced
by the time I'm through.

27:07.918 --> 27:10.421
If you have any questions,
give Gwen a shout.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.755
[Danny] Yeah. It should be okay.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.799
Been watching Dad do this
my whole life.

27:14.342 --> 27:15.968
Yeah.

27:16.177 --> 27:18.762
Oh, and please don't smoke
in front of the guests.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.432
Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure.
I'll-- I'll put it out.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.894
Hey, Ma,
I need to be put on the payroll.

27:26.896 --> 27:28.064
[Sally sighs]

27:28.231 --> 27:29.607
Of course.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.734
We can talk about that later.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.570
[Danny] Maybe a little something--
You know?

27:33.777 --> 27:36.531
- An advance to help me get set up.
- We'll talk about it.

27:37.407 --> 27:40.701
Gwen will let you know
when the guests are ready.

27:41.536 --> 27:43.538
Wear your hat.

27:48.418 --> 27:50.086
[♪♪♪]

27:53.089 --> 27:54.424
[EKG beeping]

28:10.273 --> 28:11.774
[doctor] He's conscious.

28:11.982 --> 28:15.986
He's speaking,
but we still don't have all the answers.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.364
I don't understand.
You've done all those tests.

28:18.573 --> 28:21.992
[doctor] Yeah, and it turned out
that he had several mini strokes.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.786
We tracked all of them down.

28:23.994 --> 28:28.165
But until we find the cause
of the initial clot, he's still at risk.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.833
He's, uh-- He's lucid?

28:30.334 --> 28:33.379
He seems to have
some memory loss,

28:33.588 --> 28:36.048
but that could be temporary.

28:36.257 --> 28:40.386
Considering everything he's been through,
some disorientation is common.

28:40.595 --> 28:42.763
I'm sorry.
I don't understand. Are you--?

28:42.972 --> 28:45.266
What is it exactly
that you're telling us?

28:45.475 --> 28:49.520
I know this is frustrating to hear,
but anything's possible.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.439
Including a full recovery.

28:51.648 --> 28:52.690
Yes.

28:52.898 --> 28:57.695
But we're dealing with the brain here,
so we have to be cautious.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.447
When can we see him?

28:59.656 --> 29:01.865
[doctor] In a few hours.
I'd like to give him more time.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.326
- [Sally] Thank you.
- [doctor] Okay.

29:04.368 --> 29:06.954
[Danny] Okay, guys. So...

29:07.163 --> 29:09.039
Getting ready to go in the water.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.000
Spit it right in the visor.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.753
No one's watching,
no one's judging you. Oh, that's gross.

29:14.962 --> 29:18.591
Okay. Next thing we're gonna do
is just give it a quick rinse.

29:18.799 --> 29:22.470
Oh, dear. There we go. That's gonna
keep the glass nice and clear.

29:22.679 --> 29:25.348
That way you can see
all the sharks coming for you.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.479
- Hey, Courtney.
- Hi.

29:32.813 --> 29:33.856
How are you?

29:34.064 --> 29:35.650
How's your father?

29:35.858 --> 29:37.234
We don't know yet.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.404
Patterson's office keeps calling
to set up that conference call.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.906
See if you can push it to next week.

29:44.742 --> 29:47.704
- What's with all the flowers?
- They're from clients.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.372
I don't have this many clients.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.415
People at the courthouse sent stuff too.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.502
Everyone's really worried
about your dad.

30:01.175 --> 30:03.886
I'm gonna need some time,
so no calls please. Okay?

30:04.094 --> 30:05.513
Okay.

30:09.099 --> 30:11.060
[keyboard clacking]

30:11.268 --> 30:12.729
[♪♪♪]

31:55.581 --> 31:59.293
You just relax. Okay?
I'll be right back.

32:04.298 --> 32:08.594
- How is he?
- He's tired. Doesn't wanna say much.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.639
I'm gonna get some magazines.

32:11.848 --> 32:12.890
I'll go for you.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.933
No, I could use the walk.

32:15.142 --> 32:17.436
Go on in and see him, honey.

32:31.241 --> 32:32.451
Hi, Dad.

32:32.702 --> 32:34.286
Hi. [kisses]

32:35.078 --> 32:36.955
- How are you?
- Heh.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.833
- [Meg] You look good.
- Yeah.

32:47.758 --> 32:50.302
If you're tired, I can come back.

32:58.018 --> 33:00.062
I have to talk to you.

33:01.814 --> 33:04.107
I wish I didn't, but it's important.

33:12.157 --> 33:15.619
I know you told me
to redo your estate.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.541
But I'm...

33:20.958 --> 33:22.251
sorry, I never did it.

33:23.293 --> 33:24.921
Why?

33:28.799 --> 33:32.678
I don't know, I just-- I thought
maybe that you would reconsider.

33:32.887 --> 33:34.722
And I didn't wanna do that to Danny.

33:34.931 --> 33:37.558
I hoped that you
would change your mind.

33:42.229 --> 33:44.941
I'm sorry, Dad. I should've done it.

33:46.734 --> 33:49.737
But I, uh-- I rewrote it all.

33:50.070 --> 33:53.198
So all you have to do is sign it.

33:55.451 --> 33:56.535
[Robert] Hm.

33:58.328 --> 34:00.497
So you really wanna
take Danny out of the will.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.040
[Robert] Sure.

34:13.803 --> 34:15.888
It's just right there.

34:16.513 --> 34:18.724
- Pen.
- There you go.

34:35.741 --> 34:36.784
Pen.

34:39.912 --> 34:41.038
What?

34:42.999 --> 34:45.417
It's a pen.

34:46.836 --> 34:48.921
Dad, you okay?

34:49.672 --> 34:51.214
Oh, yeah.

34:54.551 --> 34:55.678
Here.

34:55.886 --> 34:58.764
Know what, don't worry
about this right now, Dad.

35:02.685 --> 35:04.478
Sarah?

35:08.691 --> 35:10.776
No, Daddy. I'm Meg.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.488
Hm.

35:16.866 --> 35:18.158
[Danny] Guys?

35:18.367 --> 35:21.495
To your health and to your long
and successful marriages.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.413
- [woman] Cheers.
- [man] Cheers.

35:25.582 --> 35:29.879
Most likely another piece of the clot
broke free, it's blocking a blood vessel.

35:30.087 --> 35:31.171
[Meg] Is it life-threatening?

35:31.380 --> 35:34.884
[doctor] Not in itself, but this is why
we need to find the underlying cause.

35:35.092 --> 35:37.761
He doesn't seem to understand
anything that's going on.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.056
Well, it's hard to say
if it's just speech

35:40.263 --> 35:42.975
or if his comprehension
is also being impaired.

35:43.475 --> 35:47.021
I've ordered another CT scan.
That should tell us more.

35:47.229 --> 35:49.857
- Okay. Thank you.
- All right.

35:51.692 --> 35:53.485
[Kevin] If Dad wanted Danny
out of the will,

35:53.694 --> 35:55.821
why didn't you change it
when he asked you?

35:56.030 --> 35:57.781
I should have.

35:58.866 --> 36:02.160
Okay. So just have him sign the new one.

36:02.828 --> 36:06.999
Okay. You know the language of a will,
"I, so-and-so, being of sound mind"?

36:07.207 --> 36:08.751
Yeah?

36:08.959 --> 36:11.336
Dad is not of sound mind.

36:11.545 --> 36:13.463
How bad is he?

36:14.339 --> 36:15.716
He was speaking nonsense.

36:16.550 --> 36:19.177
I don't think he understood
anything that I said.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.221
Okay. Okay.

36:23.390 --> 36:24.808
He was of sound mind

36:25.017 --> 36:27.185
when he told you
he wanted Danny out. Right?

36:27.728 --> 36:29.021
- Yeah.
- Okay. So just...

36:29.229 --> 36:31.523
have him sign the new one,
then back-date it.

36:31.941 --> 36:33.776
- That's unethical.
- No one's gonna know.

36:33.984 --> 36:36.278
- It's illegal.
- Okay, then don't have him sign it.

36:36.486 --> 36:39.448
What do you want me to say?
I don't know what you want.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.325
[Meg] You know what? Forget it. It's fine.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.037
He'll be fine. When he's out,

36:45.245 --> 36:47.081
- I'll talk to him about it.
- Yeah.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.003
Fuck.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.467
What would you do?

36:59.176 --> 37:01.303
What exactly is Danny being cut out of?

37:01.511 --> 37:05.265
The business. The inn.
That's a lot of money.

37:05.474 --> 37:07.392
Okay. Forget about Dad for a second.

37:07.601 --> 37:11.563
Do you honestly think that Danny
deserves to have a piece of that place?

37:13.231 --> 37:14.984
He's our brother.

37:15.567 --> 37:16.777
And he's home now.

37:16.986 --> 37:19.071
How long do you think
that's gonna last, Meg?

37:19.279 --> 37:22.407
I'll be surprised
if he's still here in a week.

37:23.951 --> 37:25.535
[mumbles indistinctly]

37:32.835 --> 37:35.004
Oh, Jesus.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.423
All right.

37:46.056 --> 37:47.766
How old are you here?

37:50.686 --> 37:52.229
[John] Thirteen, 14.

37:58.819 --> 38:00.278
"Angelfish."

38:01.488 --> 38:03.073
Let me see that.

38:07.161 --> 38:10.164
Oh, we did a lot of fishing on that boat.

38:12.541 --> 38:15.460
Here. Here, take this.

38:15.669 --> 38:18.047
Let's get the hell out of here.

38:20.883 --> 38:21.925
All right.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.178
Here. Grab it.

38:41.195 --> 38:42.404
Hey.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.114
- Oh, hey.
- You got a minute?

38:45.282 --> 38:49.036
Uh... Maybe just. I gotta prep this boat.

38:49.578 --> 38:51.955
Mom's so happy you're home.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.832
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

38:54.041 --> 38:57.127
Well, that happiness has not found
its way into my paycheck.

38:57.294 --> 39:02.007
- Oh. I don't know anything about that.
- No, never mind. It's not your problem.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.511
Anyway, Mom's really happy.

39:09.639 --> 39:13.060
But that's only gonna make it worse
if you leave again.

39:15.312 --> 39:16.730
Who says I'm gonna leave?

39:16.939 --> 39:21.277
The thing is, she just won't have
Dad to lean on when you run out.

39:22.152 --> 39:24.446
When did you become John?

39:26.573 --> 39:29.576
I'm just asking you

39:31.036 --> 39:33.330
if you are really invested in this.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.876
Am I invested?

39:42.298 --> 39:46.426
Mister, I was here 10 years before you
were even a twinkle in Papa Ray's pants.

39:47.970 --> 39:49.263
Now, you got no idea...

39:51.140 --> 39:53.309
what I have given to this place.

39:54.184 --> 39:55.269
I know.

39:55.477 --> 39:58.897
I just-- Look.
When you go, you have no idea.

39:59.106 --> 40:00.649
You don't see Mom and Dad.

40:00.857 --> 40:03.819
And we're the ones
that have to deal with all the fallout.

40:04.027 --> 40:06.738
Do you ever wonder
what I'm left dealing with?

40:07.489 --> 40:08.949
Yeah.

40:10.784 --> 40:12.828
I'm really happy you're here.

40:13.036 --> 40:14.830
I truly am. I'm so--

40:15.038 --> 40:17.749
- I think it's so good for Mom and Dad.
- Oh, you do?

40:17.958 --> 40:19.793
That's nice.

40:23.421 --> 40:27.592
But I need to know
if she can rely on you.

40:29.303 --> 40:30.720
What's this about?

40:32.722 --> 40:35.225
We wanna know
what to expect from you.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.854
So that we can plan ahead.
So we can...

40:39.062 --> 40:40.772
It's really about the future.

40:40.981 --> 40:42.983
It's about the future.

40:45.735 --> 40:47.279
Ah.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.573
Yeah. I don't often think
of you as a lawyer,

40:50.782 --> 40:54.328
but right now,
you sound a lot like a lawyer.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.332
I'm just asking you a question.

41:01.377 --> 41:03.003
Did Dad disown me?

41:05.172 --> 41:06.589
What?

41:06.798 --> 41:08.717
I know he wanted to.

41:09.843 --> 41:11.220
Why would you say that?

41:11.428 --> 41:13.305
Hey, he told me.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.598
A while ago.

41:16.641 --> 41:17.976
He didn't do it.

41:18.185 --> 41:22.647
I mean, yeah, he talked
about it, but he-- It never happened.

41:27.444 --> 41:29.863
So this future
that you're so concerned about,

41:30.072 --> 41:31.948
I'm still in it?

41:32.157 --> 41:34.117
Yes. As it stands, we all are.

41:34.326 --> 41:38.163
- "As it stands"?
- Yeah, there's a will, we're all in it.

41:38.372 --> 41:41.541
- Including me?
- Yes. Including you.

41:42.459 --> 41:45.170
Wow, he must've changed his mind.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.923
Or he never meant it.

41:48.131 --> 41:50.633
You know, he gets angry
and he says stuff.

41:53.511 --> 41:56.056
Yeah, I know he gets angry.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.644
Hey, you wanna know
if I'm invested in this place?

42:03.063 --> 42:05.274
Treat me like family.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.901
Maybe I'll stick around.

42:12.155 --> 42:13.865
- [Diana] Is that you?
- [John] Yeah.

42:14.074 --> 42:16.993
[Diana] Oh, sweetie. You were kind of fat.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.245
[Ben laughs]

42:18.412 --> 42:20.497
- Camera added 10 pounds.
- Used to be chunky.

42:20.705 --> 42:22.540
That's a good-looking boy right there.

42:23.417 --> 42:24.793
[boys grunting on video]

42:29.005 --> 42:31.508
- Danny, come here. Look at this.
- [Diana] Hey.

42:35.471 --> 42:38.974
- Who's that?
- [John] Now, that's Uncle Kevin.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.185
- [Diana] Looks just like him.
- Always sticking his fucking nose--

42:42.394 --> 42:44.938
Hey, enough.

42:47.357 --> 42:50.068
Poor Meg.
Surrounded by all those guys.

42:50.277 --> 42:52.488
- Meg used to wear glasses?
- [Diana] Mm-hm.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.030
[all laughing on video]

42:54.197 --> 42:55.740
[Ben] That's the end of the clip.

42:56.866 --> 42:58.785
- [Danny] Where'd you find all that?
- [John] Good job.

42:58.994 --> 43:01.704
It was all in storage.
I'm putting a reel together.

43:02.414 --> 43:05.542
Doctor thinks it's a good idea
for Dad's memory loss.

43:05.750 --> 43:06.793
[Danny] Oh, yeah.

43:07.669 --> 43:10.380
Hey, John. Can we have a word?

43:24.686 --> 43:26.062
What's this?

43:26.271 --> 43:28.398
That's my first paycheck.

43:29.274 --> 43:31.485
Did you talk to Mom about that?

43:33.820 --> 43:36.823
- Yeah. Mom called.
- And you think this is all right?

43:37.032 --> 43:39.742
Hey, that's what Mom wanted.
That's not my decision.

43:40.035 --> 43:41.870
Then what did she call you for?

43:42.078 --> 43:44.331
I don't know.
I asked her the exact same thing,

43:44.540 --> 43:47.376
because I don't wanna be
in the middle of any of this.

43:47.584 --> 43:49.378
You know,
Manny makes more than this.

43:50.462 --> 43:52.047
Mom said she wants you to earn it.

43:52.255 --> 43:54.883
She just wants to make sure
you're committed. That's all.

43:55.425 --> 43:57.010
Okay. I gotta go talk to Mom then.

43:57.219 --> 43:59.262
The fuck you talking about,
"go talk to Mom"?

43:59.471 --> 44:01.473
A few days ago,
you're passed out naked on the dock,

44:01.681 --> 44:04.767
Dad's in the hospital, now you're
gonna push Mom around about this?

44:04.976 --> 44:06.395
What are you thinking?

44:07.479 --> 44:09.022
Just do the work.

44:16.946 --> 44:19.366
Hey, do you need
to borrow some money?

44:20.116 --> 44:22.244
Just fucking asking.

44:27.790 --> 44:29.876
- [Chelsea] It's a pretty easy shot.
- Shh. Quiet.

44:30.085 --> 44:31.628
I'm just saying. Hard to miss.

44:31.836 --> 44:36.592
- You not think I know what you're doing?
- [laughs] Okay. I'll shut up.

44:36.799 --> 44:39.802
- I mean, seriously, a kid can--
- Oh, shit.

44:40.011 --> 44:41.721
Look what you did.

44:41.930 --> 44:44.015
Are you fucking happy now?

44:44.224 --> 44:47.269
Feeling pretty good
about yourself, huh?

44:47.644 --> 44:49.145
It's just a little mind control.

44:50.272 --> 44:53.149
- I'm in your head, Rayburn.
- Heh, heh, heh.

44:53.316 --> 44:54.610
I own you.

44:54.817 --> 44:57.279
Oh, yeah?
Okay, what am I thinking about?

44:57.487 --> 44:59.322
No, right now.
What am I thinking about?

44:59.615 --> 45:01.366
[Chelsea] Um...

45:01.533 --> 45:03.952
- That you're gonna get me another drink?
- Oh, no. No.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.455
- Yes.
- No, no, no.

45:06.663 --> 45:08.248
I gotta work in the morning.

45:08.457 --> 45:09.916
Why do you work there?

45:10.917 --> 45:13.836
It's the family business.

45:14.254 --> 45:16.131
Well, they don't deserve you.

45:16.339 --> 45:18.758
John won't let you see
my brother? Fuck him.

45:18.967 --> 45:21.386
No, John's okay. He's just John.

45:21.595 --> 45:24.889
He can't help it.
It's like a fucking disease.

45:28.017 --> 45:30.979
No, it's my little sister
I gotta watch out for.

45:32.272 --> 45:33.898
Why?

45:36.985 --> 45:38.778
Weren't you in her class?

45:38.987 --> 45:40.989
She was a year below me.

45:41.197 --> 45:44.409
- Did you ever hang out with her?
- Are you fucking kidding?

45:44.618 --> 45:45.661
What's that mean?

45:46.744 --> 45:48.455
I don't wanna talk shit about Meg.

45:48.664 --> 45:52.292
I mean, she never did anything to me
personally, it's just--

45:52.501 --> 45:55.629
You know, she was the kind of girl
other girls like to hate.

45:56.129 --> 45:57.755
Really?

45:57.964 --> 46:01.384
Why would anyone not love
my sweet little sister?

46:01.926 --> 46:04.095
Because all the boys liked her.

46:04.304 --> 46:05.888
I don't remember this.

46:06.097 --> 46:08.433
It was in high school. You were gone.

46:08.642 --> 46:10.768
She had a fucking army of boyfriends.

46:10.977 --> 46:13.188
She just kept trading them up
for a hotter guy.

46:14.063 --> 46:15.982
Hey, what about the guy
she's with now?

46:16.191 --> 46:17.567
What about him?

46:17.775 --> 46:19.528
They've been together a long time.

46:19.736 --> 46:22.572
And he's gorgeous,
and they're not married yet.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.073
Why do you think?

46:24.991 --> 46:26.075
Don't know.

46:26.284 --> 46:28.662
Because no one's
ever good enough for her.

46:28.870 --> 46:30.497
Just like the rest of your family.

46:33.082 --> 46:34.834
You gonna get me that drink?

46:36.002 --> 46:37.379
Yeah.

46:40.965 --> 46:43.468
Yeah, I'll get you a drink, Cece.

46:43.801 --> 46:45.554
Vodka-cranberry, please.

46:47.597 --> 46:52.435
I hate seeing him like this,
not knowing if he can understand us.

46:55.938 --> 46:57.566
It's late.

46:57.774 --> 46:59.526
You should let me take you home.

46:59.735 --> 47:01.653
Danny's picking me up.

47:02.529 --> 47:03.572
But you should go.

47:03.780 --> 47:06.908
You should be out with Marco,
living your life.

47:07.283 --> 47:08.577
I am living my life.

47:08.785 --> 47:12.955
And I am choosing to be here
with my parents.

47:17.043 --> 47:18.503
I'm worried about you, Meggy.

47:19.003 --> 47:20.505
Mom, I'm fine.

47:20.714 --> 47:23.841
- Your father's worried about you too.
- Okay, Mom.

47:24.050 --> 47:26.886
It would make him so happy
to see you settled.

47:30.724 --> 47:32.350
Hey, Mom.

47:33.226 --> 47:34.519
- Ready to go?
- [Sally] Yeah.

47:34.728 --> 47:37.731
- Let me say good night to your father.
- [Danny] Mm-hm.

47:40.233 --> 47:42.360
- Oh, I should say good night too.
- Mm.

47:49.992 --> 47:51.536

48:08.094 --> 48:09.679

[♪♪♪]

48:39.709 --> 48:41.252
[buzzes]

49:13.034 --> 49:15.119
[Meg] All right. Good night.

49:15.537 --> 49:17.455
Yeah. Take it easy.

49:22.669 --> 49:25.087
- [John] Hey, good morning.
- Morning.

49:25.839 --> 49:28.675
- Can I show you something?
- Yeah.

49:28.884 --> 49:34.723
All right. So you told me only
to use the stuff after 1984, right?

49:35.181 --> 49:36.265
Yeah.

49:36.474 --> 49:40.353
I did, but this
must've been dated wrong.

49:41.229 --> 49:44.065
- [Young John] Yeah. Okay. You got it.
- [Sally] Make a wish.

49:44.273 --> 49:46.984
- [John] That's Meg's birthday.
- [Sally] Make a wish.

49:48.194 --> 49:49.487
[Sally] Oh, yeah. Come on.

49:49.779 --> 49:53.742
- [Young Kevin] Arguing about your--
- [Young Danny] Oh, wow, that's pink.

50:03.376 --> 50:05.169
[♪♪♪]

50:35.366 --> 50:37.535
[people speaking indistinctly on video]

50:37.911 --> 50:39.245
When was this?

50:40.789 --> 50:43.291
Eighty-three, '84.

50:44.542 --> 50:47.462
- [Robert] Say hi. Say hi, Angelfish.
- Hi. Hi.

50:47.670 --> 50:50.381
- [Robert] Come dance with me.
- Is that Sarah?

50:52.091 --> 50:53.175
Yeah.

50:53.384 --> 50:56.679
- Yeah, that's her.
- Should I add this to the reel?

50:57.263 --> 50:59.557
No. He doesn't need to see this.

51:01.476 --> 51:04.896
[Sally] Yes. If you eat it,
you can have it more.

51:05.605 --> 51:07.231
[Young Kevin]
You're gonna get fat.

51:07.857 --> 51:09.609
[Robert] Oh, good job.

51:11.569 --> 51:12.737
[♪♪♪]

51:28.544 --> 51:30.463
- [Sarah] Hi.
- How are you?

51:30.672 --> 51:33.049
- [Sarah] Good. Yeah.
- Yes?

51:33.257 --> 51:36.093
- See if we can find some sand dollars.
- Yeah.

51:37.804 --> 51:39.305
[Robert] What have you been doing?

51:39.514 --> 51:42.725
- [Sarah] I don't know, twirling.
- Twirling?

51:43.142 --> 51:44.686
[Sarah] Come with us.

51:47.689 --> 51:50.817
[Marco] Just make a decision
and stop torturing yourself.

51:50.984 --> 51:52.527
[Meg sighs]

51:55.905 --> 51:59.367
If it would have been any other client,
I would've just done what he asked.

51:59.575 --> 52:02.244
He's not any other client.
He's your father.

52:02.453 --> 52:04.914
And he put you
in an impossible situation.

52:05.081 --> 52:05.999
[sighs]

52:06.082 --> 52:08.417
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

52:13.006 --> 52:14.674
I do wanna talk about us.

52:14.883 --> 52:16.885
What you said the other night.

52:22.015 --> 52:23.391
I'm sorry for bringing it up.

52:23.808 --> 52:25.643
- No, don't be sorry.
- No, really. We--

52:26.769 --> 52:28.479
We don't have to talk about it.

52:30.356 --> 52:33.150
I've been unfair to you.

52:33.359 --> 52:35.820
I've been holding back.
I'm sorry. I don't know why.

52:38.656 --> 52:40.366
Look. Why don't--?

52:40.909 --> 52:42.201
Maybe we should just stop.

52:44.913 --> 52:47.206
- Stop?
- Stop.

52:50.459 --> 52:53.129
- Why?
- Well, because it's been five years,

52:53.337 --> 52:55.840
and you're holding back,

52:56.049 --> 52:58.593
and we're having this conversation.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.723
There must be a reason.

53:05.391 --> 53:07.810
Is there a reason?

53:13.399 --> 53:14.817
No.

53:16.778 --> 53:18.195
No.

53:21.574 --> 53:24.410
I don't wanna stop.
You're part of my family.

53:24.577 --> 53:25.620
[knocking on door]

53:28.205 --> 53:29.665
- [Meg] Hey, what's going on?
- Hey.

53:29.874 --> 53:31.709
- Is it Dad? Is he okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

53:31.918 --> 53:33.878
I was riding the bike,
thought I'd drop by.

53:34.087 --> 53:35.130
- [Marco] Hey.
- Hey, brother.

53:35.337 --> 53:36.631
How you doing? Hey, listen.

53:36.839 --> 53:41.302
I wanna have a word with my
little sister alone. Would that be okay?

53:41.510 --> 53:43.805
- [Marco] Yeah.
- Thanks, man.

53:44.430 --> 53:45.723
[sighs]

53:48.977 --> 53:52.271
- We'll finish talking later. Yeah?
- Yeah. Be careful.

53:54.356 --> 53:56.192
[Meg clears throat and sighs]

53:56.358 --> 54:00.738
Sorry it's so hot in here. My AC's out.

54:00.947 --> 54:02.573
[Danny] Yeah.

54:02.782 --> 54:05.326
- He's a really good guy.
- Yeah. He is.

54:08.621 --> 54:10.247
I'd fucking hate for him

54:10.456 --> 54:15.377
to have to find out about... that.

54:16.337 --> 54:18.173
What is that?

54:18.380 --> 54:21.592
That fell out of your bag
when you were in the driveway.

54:22.426 --> 54:26.430
- No, it didn't. It's not mine.
- Yeah. That was in your bag.

54:29.851 --> 54:32.187
Maybe one of the guests
dropped it in the driveway.

54:32.311 --> 54:34.772
That was there
after you dropped everything.

54:34.981 --> 54:37.108
It was sitting right there.

54:41.529 --> 54:43.364
Did you take that from me?

54:43.572 --> 54:45.116
No, I told you.

54:46.034 --> 54:48.036
At the hospital,
did you go in my purse?

54:48.244 --> 54:50.663
- So it's yours?
- What does it matter?

54:50.746 --> 54:53.791
I went to a hotel for one night
because it was hot here.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.543
- I have-- My AC's out.
- Come on.

54:55.751 --> 54:58.671
I heard you on the phone.
I don't know who you were talking to.

54:58.880 --> 55:00.673
- It wasn't Marco.
- You know what?

55:00.882 --> 55:04.677
- You are so off-base right now.
- Look, I'm not here to judge you. Okay?

55:04.886 --> 55:07.304
I'm just saying
you need to be careful because--

55:07.847 --> 55:10.558
What if he finds out about this?
What if he found this?

55:10.766 --> 55:13.686
- How you gonna explain that?
- I don't have to explain anything.

55:13.895 --> 55:15.479
No, you don't. Not now.

55:15.688 --> 55:19.234
But someday you might.

55:23.404 --> 55:25.031
Why are you here?

55:28.117 --> 55:30.703
You said that Dad didn't disown me.

55:31.328 --> 55:32.621
Yeah.

55:33.164 --> 55:35.083
But he still might.

55:35.291 --> 55:37.793
And you may have a say in that.

55:43.299 --> 55:46.844
- Are you seriously trying to threaten me?
- No, baby. I'm not threatening you.

55:47.053 --> 55:48.512
I am not threatening you.

55:48.721 --> 55:51.599
I could fucking threaten you.
I could do the big-brother thing.

55:51.807 --> 55:53.268
Bully around the little sister.

55:53.475 --> 55:57.813
It's never been our relationship, though,
has it? I've always looked out for you.

55:58.022 --> 56:00.357
Even when we were little kids,
I felt sorry for you

56:00.566 --> 56:04.528
because Dad hated me,
but at least I got his attention.

56:06.363 --> 56:09.200
Now, I don't care
if you're fucking around. I don't.

56:09.408 --> 56:11.493
I don't judge you.

56:13.121 --> 56:14.830
I got your back, Mister.

56:18.375 --> 56:20.586
I just hope you got mine.

56:27.843 --> 56:30.054
Hey, I wanna tell you something.

56:31.013 --> 56:32.807
You don't have to marry Marco.

56:33.224 --> 56:35.935
- I know that.
- No, you don't.

56:36.144 --> 56:38.562
And you may marry him...

56:39.272 --> 56:41.274
because you think
that's what Dad wants.

56:43.276 --> 56:46.028
I've watched you try to please him
and try to please him.

56:46.237 --> 56:50.283
But you just--
You can't. You never will.

56:50.699 --> 56:52.285
Why's that?

56:53.286 --> 56:55.496
Because you're not her.

[♪♪♪]

57:02.586 --> 57:04.630
[door opens and closes]

57:11.929 --> 57:16.392
[John] Maybe it was Meg's decision
that started this whole thing.

57:17.268 --> 57:19.228
I tried to tell her,

57:19.436 --> 57:21.856
but she wouldn't listen to me.

57:22.523 --> 57:25.734
Still, I can't blame her for what she did.

57:27.236 --> 57:28.696
Whatever mistakes she made...

57:29.864 --> 57:32.574
her heart was in the right place.

57:33.534 --> 57:36.120
And in the end,

57:36.287 --> 57:37.663
she's my sister.

57:37.830 --> 57:39.040
[cell phone ringing]

57:45.213 --> 57:46.505
[John on phone]
What did you do?

57:48.007 --> 57:50.426
[John in voiceover]
And I'd trust her with my life.
