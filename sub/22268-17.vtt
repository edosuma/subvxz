Ah, friends, our Jane has been

00:03.307 --> 00:04.613
through quite a telenovela--

00:04.656 --> 00:06.745
but at long last,
she fell in love

00:06.789 --> 00:09.922
with her baby-by-accidental-
insemination daddy, Rafael.

00:09.966 --> 00:13.404
Even more romantic... You are on a roll
with your writing.

00:13.448 --> 00:17.017
Let's bet on
yourdream now.
Mine will come.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.019
Unfortunately,
things weren't as great

00:19.062 --> 00:20.411
with her mother, Xiomara.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.283
See, she had cancer,

00:22.326 --> 00:24.067
but Rogelio was there for her.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.547
And speaking of power couples,

00:25.590 --> 00:29.029
we have Petra and Jane Ramos,
aka J.R.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.639
You'll recall
they met because...

00:30.682 --> 00:32.293

00:32.336 --> 00:34.208
So Petra needed a good lawyer.

00:34.251 --> 00:38.125
Unfortunately, J.R. was working against her...

00:38.168 --> 00:40.301
until she was convinced
of Petra's innocence,

00:40.344 --> 00:41.954
and then she came clean.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.217
And Petra?

00:43.260 --> 00:46.002
Well, she came, too--
multiple times.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.352
But then her crazy mother
came back to town.

00:48.396 --> 00:52.139
Petra killed Anezka...
in cold blood.

00:52.182 --> 00:54.141
So J.R. sacrificed her career.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.969
I came clean to the D.A.,
and your case was dismissed,

00:57.013 --> 00:57.970
with prejudice.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.320

with Rogelio in a remake

01:08.981 --> 01:10.461

some creative differences.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.015
Okay. I just want to help.

09:41.058 --> 09:43.844
It seemed like a...
like a p-practical solution.

09:43.887 --> 09:46.498
That's why I don't
want to do it.

09:46.542 --> 09:49.719
[sighs]: Look... I didn't
expect to feel like this

09:49.763 --> 09:51.286
about you.

09:51.329 --> 09:53.201
But here we are.

09:54.637 --> 09:58.336
And I'm in love with you.You are?

09:58.380 --> 10:01.122
I knew it wasn't a draft
from the window. Yes.

10:01.165 --> 10:04.038
So I don't want to do
anything out of convenience

10:04.081 --> 10:06.344
or... obligation or guilt.

10:06.388 --> 10:07.868
I only want to move in

10:07.911 --> 10:09.739
if we're both
on the same page emotionally.

10:09.783 --> 10:12.263
And if you're
not there yet,

10:12.307 --> 10:14.309
I'm willing to wait.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.485
[phone chimes]Oh, my God.

10:16.528 --> 10:19.749
What?My friend from the DA's
office just texted.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.012
Krishna just turned herself in.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.756
JANE:
The plot twist isn't landing

10:26.800 --> 10:28.628
because it wasn't
set up properly.[phone chimes]

10:28.671 --> 10:30.194
I tried to layer in
exposition...

10:30.238 --> 10:31.369
Hold on.
I...

10:31.413 --> 10:32.501
Petra just texted me.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.677
Krishna turned herself in.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.026
You're kidding. Out of the blue?

10:37.941 --> 10:39.421
You remember, Abuela,
she was Petra's assistant.

10:39.464 --> 10:40.901
The one who tried
to frame Petra for murder

10:40.944 --> 10:42.598
and then disappeared
out the window.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.992
Yeah, it's pretty surprising.
You were saying?

10:45.035 --> 10:48.604
Just that the exposition helped,
but it didn't solve the problem.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.432
Hm.
I think I have to
go further back.

10:50.475 --> 10:51.955
Maybe even to
the beginning.

10:56.873 --> 10:57.874
Hm?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.708
What happened to bingo?

11:05.752 --> 11:07.667
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Raf told
her he's gonna propose!

11:12.367 --> 11:14.456
Oh, that's too bad, I'm sorry.
But I'm writing.

11:33.257 --> 11:35.042
Um... W-W-What party
Jorge is throwing?

11:41.744 --> 11:43.572
Oh, wow.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.967
Incredibly, incredibly sweet.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.577
You got to cancel that party.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.013
It's more of a toast.

11:50.057 --> 11:53.190
Right. Um, here's the thing,

11:53.234 --> 11:55.366
we're planning
a surprise party for her

11:55.410 --> 11:56.628
right after the ceremony.

11:56.672 --> 11:59.762
Oh, I'm sorry, I had no idea.

11:59.806 --> 12:00.937
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Awkward.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.809
I know, a-and that's my fault.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.462
We didn't invite you

12:04.506 --> 12:06.029
because we weren't sure
where you two stood.

12:06.073 --> 12:07.509
After the proposal,

12:07.552 --> 12:09.641
and her turning you down twice
and you rejecting her...

12:09.685 --> 12:11.643
Thanks for the recap.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Right?

12:11.687 --> 12:14.081
Everybody thinks they can do
your job for you.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.473
Sorry.

12:15.517 --> 12:18.738
I'll cancel the toast,
say I got the flu.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.435
That always works.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.310
Jane?
Yes. S-Sorry.

12:26.354 --> 12:27.572
Anyway...

12:27.616 --> 12:29.270
Will you come
to my abuela's party?

12:29.313 --> 12:31.315
I know that she would love
to have you there.

12:31.359 --> 12:34.318
Absolutely. Can I bring
some refreshments?

12:34.362 --> 12:37.104
Water, with lemon.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.583
FYI, I prefer lime
and sparkling.

12:38.627 --> 12:39.715
As my on-screen husband,

12:39.759 --> 12:41.108
you really should
know that about me.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.545
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Poor Rogelio.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.590
He's drowning in this River.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.767
Hey, hey. I have
dress options.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.639
What do you think?The gold.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.293
You will take Rafael's
breath away tonight.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.599
Rafael's? No, these dresses
are for my mom.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.210
Mm-hmm.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.342
For my Mom's citizenship
party, River.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.083
I'm not up
for shopping.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.911
[laughing]:
Right, of course.

13:01.955 --> 13:03.652
For the party
for "Abla."

13:03.695 --> 13:05.436
What else could
they be for?

13:05.480 --> 13:07.090
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: River
so needs to stop "habla-ing."

13:07.134 --> 13:09.005
Okay, what's going on?

13:09.049 --> 13:11.051
First Abuela comes in hard
with the offer to babysit,

13:11.094 --> 13:15.446
now you're telling me to dress
up for my dinner tonight--

13:15.490 --> 13:18.449
Oh, my God. Is Rafael proposing?
Is that what this is about?

13:18.493 --> 13:20.887
Nah, no way.No.
Definitely not.

13:20.930 --> 13:24.673
Phew. I am so
not ready for that.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.675
Really? You're not?

13:26.718 --> 13:28.851
Ah-ha! He is proposing,
isn't he?

13:31.158 --> 13:32.812
Yes.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.075
We were really trying
to keep it a surprise.

13:35.118 --> 13:36.337
I'm so sorry.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.512
You should be...It's fine.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.035
It's totally fine.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.297
I don't like
surprises, remember?

13:40.341 --> 13:41.603
This is good.
I can get a manicure,

13:41.646 --> 13:43.518
be Instagram ready.

13:43.561 --> 13:46.869
Wait, does that mean
you're saying yes?

13:46.913 --> 13:50.481
I love him so much.

13:50.525 --> 13:54.094
Yeah, he is my future.
Who else could it be?

13:57.401 --> 13:58.663
Oh, congratulations.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.056
[squeals]

14:00.100 --> 14:04.234
I saw a picture of that
hottie. Well done.

14:09.587 --> 14:12.547
Wow. Busy.Cruise ship.

14:12.590 --> 14:15.376
We'll help check
people in.

14:15.419 --> 14:18.248
Could you move over a little
and get the step stool, Sharon?

14:18.292 --> 14:20.947
Anna's in a mood,
and Ellie's upset

14:20.990 --> 14:22.383
'cause she wanted
tuna tartare not tuna fish,

14:22.426 --> 14:24.211
which I didn't have at
my apartment, obviously.

14:25.603 --> 14:26.953
Petra, you there?

14:26.996 --> 14:28.693
Hm? Yeah.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.434
What's going on?
Nothing.

14:31.609 --> 14:34.569
JR told me she loves me.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.919
Whoa.
I know.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.181
Well, do you love her?

14:38.225 --> 14:40.531
I think I do.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.577
Okay, so what's the problem?

14:42.620 --> 14:46.450
I'm just waiting for
the other shoe to drop

14:46.494 --> 14:47.974
because it always does.

14:48.017 --> 14:51.542
My advice?
Let yourself be happy.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.936
You deserve it.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.286
Thank you.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.071
We've come a long way, huh?

14:58.114 --> 15:01.639
Yeah, we have.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.599
MAN:
Go see Sin Rostro now.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.521
ROSE:
You're a hard one

15:13.564 --> 15:14.870
to get ahold of.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.393
What do you want?

15:16.437 --> 15:18.874
I have information for you.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.790
In exchange, I'd love
to know where Luisa is.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.487
I'm not telling you.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.620
And whoever my parents are,
I don't care.

15:25.663 --> 15:26.969
I think you'll change your mind

15:27.013 --> 15:28.623
when you hear
what I have to say.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.323
JANE:
Oh, no.

15:33.367 --> 15:36.761
Abuela, I'm sorry that Jorge
cancelled your party.

15:36.805 --> 15:39.503
Toast, right.

15:39.547 --> 15:42.419
He's sick? Aw, wow,
what a bummer.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.117
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Nice acting, Jane.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.814
Rogelio would be proud.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.598
Listen, I just got to Rafael's.

15:47.642 --> 15:51.689
Yeah, I'll call you after.
Love you, too.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.649
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right,
now let's get engaged.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.005
Did I get the time wrong?

16:03.049 --> 16:04.659
[groans] No.

16:04.702 --> 16:05.965
Sorry, I just lost track...

16:07.270 --> 16:08.793
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That can't be good.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.795
Is everything okay?

16:10.839 --> 16:12.884
You know what,
this isn't a good time.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.408
You should go.

16:14.451 --> 16:15.670
Rafael, why? What's going on?

16:15.713 --> 16:16.627
Please, Jane...Whatever it is,

16:16.671 --> 16:17.802
you can tell me.
Stop!

16:17.846 --> 16:19.674
I need you to leave.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.677
Please, go.

16:35.124 --> 16:37.735
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So,
friends, with a broken heart,

16:37.779 --> 16:41.957
Jane went to do something she's done a hundred times before...

16:50.966 --> 16:53.403
...which is exactly why she didn't want to do it again.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.015
Open the door.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.063
What are you doing?

17:02.412 --> 17:04.197
I'm not leaving.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.983
I'm not in a good place, Jane.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.378
Obviously, and you don't have
to talk to me, but I'm staying

17:11.421 --> 17:13.162
because we're in
a relationship,

17:13.206 --> 17:16.426
and people in relationships
don't leave.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.219
PETRA:
I want you here.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.264
Not because I feel
guilty or obligated,

17:28.308 --> 17:29.961
but because...

17:30.005 --> 17:33.922
I love you, too.

17:33.965 --> 17:36.011
Which is scary because it's
so fast, but here's the thing,

17:36.055 --> 17:37.447
I've never felt
about anyone

17:37.491 --> 17:40.407
the way I feel
when I'm with you,

17:40.450 --> 17:42.496
and I think I just
quoted Dirty Dancing,

17:42.539 --> 17:44.889
but that's the kind
of cheesy thing you make me do.

17:44.933 --> 17:48.676
I happen to love
Dirty Dancing.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.073
And okay,

17:54.116 --> 17:57.119
I'm moving in.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.208
Good.

17:59.252 --> 18:03.430
Now, let's talk about
the elephant in the room.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.345
I really don't want to go
to Jane's party tomorrow.

18:05.388 --> 18:08.391
[laughs]Can I just stay
with the twins?

18:08.435 --> 18:10.698
Of course.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.396
And now...

18:13.440 --> 18:14.963
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh.

18:15.006 --> 18:17.357
Looks like Petra's
got "Hungry Eyes."

18:17.400 --> 18:19.620
...let's go to bed.

18:19.663 --> 18:22.840
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw.

18:22.884 --> 18:25.060
Nobody puts Jane in the corner.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.454
I'll stop.

18:40.206 --> 18:44.166
You can tell me anything.
I want you to know that.

18:52.392 --> 18:53.871
[sighs]

19:00.226 --> 19:02.445
I went to see Rose.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.273
What?

19:04.317 --> 19:07.189
So she would leave me alone.

19:07.233 --> 19:10.105
Did she say something
about your parents?

19:15.110 --> 19:18.635
Whoever they are,
you can tell me.

19:51.668 --> 19:52.756
Hey.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.150
How did you sleep?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.586
Okay.

19:59.372 --> 20:02.244
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, maybe
he's finally ready to talk.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.245
So...

20:04.333 --> 20:06.248
...should we go over the plan

20:06.292 --> 20:07.989
for after your
grandmother's ceremony?

20:08.032 --> 20:10.252
I say something came up
with Petra, right?

20:10.296 --> 20:12.863
That I got to pick up the girls?

20:12.907 --> 20:15.997
Right.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.260
Then you take the car.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.262
My mom already said she has
a doctor's appointment.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.960
Which means Abuela, Mateo, and I
will have to take the bus,

20:23.004 --> 20:24.571
giving you 30 extra
minutes to set up.

20:24.614 --> 20:27.008
Great, and River's there
now with the caterers.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.444
[loud groan]

20:28.488 --> 20:31.839
Stop. She's helping.
She's also getting the cake.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.145
Is she getting me the last week
of my life back?

20:34.189 --> 20:36.365
Come on, Rogelio,
don't be so hard on her.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.801
I've gotten to know
River a little,

20:37.845 --> 20:39.368
and I think she's
just lonely.

20:39.412 --> 20:42.023
She's been divorced four times,
she's in a new city.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.765
I think she probably just likes
spending time with our family.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.506
JANE:
Shh, the ceremony is starting.

20:46.549 --> 20:49.030
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well,
it is a pretty great family.

20:49.073 --> 20:51.119
[exhales]

20:51.162 --> 20:53.556
ALL: I will support
and defend the Constitution,

20:53.600 --> 20:58.779
and laws of the United States
of America.

20:58.822 --> 21:02.609
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.571
[laughs]

21:17.363 --> 21:18.755
[whoops]

21:18.799 --> 21:20.322
OFFICIANT:
Congratulations.

21:20.366 --> 21:23.107
You are now officially
Americans.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.457
[cheering, applause]Yeah, Abuela!

21:24.500 --> 21:26.937
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends,

21:26.981 --> 21:30.550
meet one of my favorite
United States citizens.

21:35.032 --> 21:37.861
ROGELIO:
"Congratulations, Abla"?

21:37.905 --> 21:39.776
Yeah, I thought it would
be nice to personalize it.

21:39.820 --> 21:43.084
It wouldbe nice,
if that was her name.

21:43.127 --> 21:46.783
No. But her name is "Alba."

21:46.827 --> 21:50.657
"Alba."

21:50.700 --> 21:53.529
Why is that so hard
for you to remember?

As I studied
for my citizenship exam,

27:45.664 --> 27:49.668

of the United States:

27:49.711 --> 27:51.626
E pluribus unum.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.629
"Out of many, one."

27:54.673 --> 27:56.718
It is said that it originated

27:56.762 --> 28:00.548
by the famous
Roman writer Cicero,

28:00.591 --> 28:03.769
about family and friends:

"When each person loves
the other as much as herself,

it makes one out of many."
