 can she, Cathy?

 -Mm-hm.
 -Good.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.039
 Could you give me a lift to Siobhan's?

 If I asked you really nicely,
 would you change your mind?

01:10.280 --> 01:13.280
 Simon, you're not coming, okay?
 You're my boss, you're a bloke

 -Mm.
 -So what's not to be okay about?

02:30.080 --> 02:33.080
 I know. He's gorgeous.
 Excuse me! And rich.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.040
 -Yeah, but she's known him for, what?
 -A heartbeat.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.240
 Exactly. I mean,
 doesn't he sleep around?

02:41.720 --> 02:44.479
 So does she.
 This is Jessica we're talking about,

02:44.480 --> 02:47.479
 whose appetites are a mystery
 even to herself.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.239
 -She's going to be fine.
 -And if it's the worst mistake

 I will do the divorce for nothing.

 -Yeah, the boycott.

 -There's no boycott.
 -Oh, so what is it, then?

03:02.240 --> 03:05.240
 It's a happy abstinence.
 A newjob, a new beginning.

 -Okay.

 I'm just worried about you, Katie.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.400
 -About what?
 -Lack of use.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.440
 There are several well-documented cases
 of it growing over.

 -Pants didn't work then?
 -No, they did.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.239
 I just overcame the temptation.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.799
 Hm.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.599
 Uh, I wanted to make sure
 I'm ready for tomorrow.

 Ah, yes. Look out, Nigella.

10:29.320 --> 10:32.320
 -Are you making fun of me?
 -No.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.599
 Well, a little. Sorry. It's just...

10:35.600 --> 10:38.600
 Seems like a lot of work.
 I mean, you're hardly a lady of leisure.

10:39.080 --> 10:42.080
 I know. It's just a few cakes.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.320
 -You know, and the chance to...
 -To what?

10:46.160 --> 10:49.160
 Well, to get a new pair of tights,
 or a dress, or...

10:50.520 --> 10:53.520
 I don't know, take us somewhere
 for the weekend, somewhere different.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.799
 You know I'd do those things
 if I could, don't you?

10:55.800 --> 10:58.359
 No, no, yeah.
 I'm sorry, that's not what I was...

10:58.360 --> 11:01.360
 -I know.
 -No, it's just that it would be nice.

 -Where have you been?
 -Oh, Jesus! Hari!

11:50.760 --> 11:53.760
 I couldn't sleep, I had a headache.
 So I just

11:54.360 --> 11:57.360
 went to the chemist and, um...

11:58.400 --> 12:00.119
 -We'd run out, so I...
 -I must have finished them.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.719
 Yeah.

 -I was worried about you.
 -No, don't be. I took two. I'm fine now.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.800
 Good.

12:12.120 --> 12:15.120

 suits Duggan, doesn't it?

19:38.720 --> 19:40.559
 Okay.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.560
 Um... That is brilliant. Oops! Sorry.

 -Hi. Hi. Katie?
 -Yeah.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.359
 -I'm Vicki Kendall, your registrar.
 -Oh, Vicki, hi, hi.

20:06.360 --> 20:08.239
 Jack should just be coming.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.240
 -If you want to join us...
 -Sorry, everybody. Sorry.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.600
 And welcome, Dr Roden.
 So, who's first up?

20:17.160 --> 20:20.160
 Why don't I take this, Katie?
 Then from tomorrow it's all yours.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.639
 -Okay?
 -Okay, great.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.599
 I just want you to have a look at
 Mrs Elliot, admitted last night,

20:24.600 --> 20:26.759

21:10.240 --> 21:13.240
 Thanks, honey.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.640
 You're shocked.
 I've even managed to shock you.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.479
 Oh, what am I,
 some sort of aberration barometer?

21:26.480 --> 21:29.480
 I want someone to disapprove.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.120
 Because you don't.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.520
 It's...

21:38.720 --> 21:41.720
 It's just... It's just something I need.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.079
 Stupid question, obviously.

21:49.080 --> 21:52.080
 But can't that need be satisfied
 by the man who's lying next to you?

21:54.480 --> 21:56.199
 That's just it.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.200
 Hari and I haven't had sex
 in quite some time.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.800
 -What's quite some time?
 -1 8 months, give or take.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.520
 Katie, just...they're strangers.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
 That's almost the most important thing,
 because this way it's...

22:13.240 --> 22:16.240
 It's not like with Dominic,
 it's not an affair.

 and they don't know mine.

 -Until it becomes something else.

 This is bad for you, Siobhan.
 And it's dangerous.

22:39.320 --> 22:42.320
 It's not going to solve anything,
 which is why you have to stop.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.760

 your husband back into your bed.

 -This is always happening.
 -It's not my fault.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.960
 Well, it's not. It's this, our life,
 our ridiculous lives.

23:20.680 --> 23:23.279
 I mean, we divide ourselves
 between two homes,

23:23.280 --> 23:25.959
 which neither of us can afford.
 We never have any money.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.079
 You're stressed. I'm stressed.

23:28.080 --> 23:31.080
 I mean, none of us know
 if we're coming or going.

23:31.400 --> 23:34.400
 -We could make our lives so much easier.
 -Okay.

23:34.600 --> 23:37.600
 It's simple. Amy and I should move in.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.239
 -Because it makes our lives easier?
 -Yes.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.240
 Richard, we are not going to move in
 together because it's convenient,

23:46.120 --> 23:49.120
 -or because it saves us money.
 -Why not?

23:49.400 --> 23:52.400
 -Because it's not very romantic.
 -Romantic?

23:56.240 --> 23:58.599
 Right, so you'd like me
 to compose a ballad

23:58.600 --> 24:00.639
 and scale your walls
 with a rose between my teeth,

24:00.640 --> 24:03.279
 -then my daughter and I can move in?
 -No, I'd like you to

24:03.280 --> 24:05.959
 pick up your pants off the floor.
 Or maybe even open the window

24:05.960 --> 24:07.439
 in the morning
 when you've been to the loo.

24:07.440 --> 24:10.440
 The window? Sorry, I didn't realise
 you were such a princess.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
 Well, I'm sorry I didn't realise
 you were such a pig.

 -Doctor. Well, how did it go?
 -No one died.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.319
 -Well, a success then.
 -I don't know,

 you know.

 -Do what?
 -The big sister thing.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.079
 Oh, I'm just a wee bit worried, Jess,
 that's all.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.639
 I know, I know. It's all so fast, yeah?

25:01.640 --> 25:03.719
 And Alex, and...

25:03.720 --> 25:05.839
 Yeah, what do we really know
 about each other?

25:05.840 --> 25:08.839
 Exactly.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.840
 Trudi, he is the most exciting thing
 that's ever happened to me.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.999
 Okay?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.919
 And I don't want to do that thing of

25:16.920 --> 25:19.039
 going out with him for five years
 and then getting married

25:19.040 --> 25:22.039
 because we're bored
 and can't think of anything else to do.

25:22.040 --> 25:25.040
 -This way it's...
 -It's romantic.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.719
 Yeah, that.

 Oh, what have you done
 with my lovely new kitchen?

25:31.720 --> 25:32.839
 Hi.

25:32.840 --> 25:35.359
 I was perfectly happy with just
 a lump of cheese and a Kit Kat.

 we're going to look after you.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.199
 Not a student, house officer.
 Very different.

 and hung over?

 -Student.

 -Hey, hello.
 -Hello.

 -How are you?
 -Oh, lovely.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.640
 -Any glasses?
 -Somebody got...

 He called me a princess.

 That's probably a bit strong, but then,
 Trudi, we're not teenagers any more.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.679
 I don't think I'm being
 that unrealistic.

26:03.680 --> 26:06.639
 What sort of message is
 that sending out to our kids, right?

26:06.640 --> 26:09.639
 That two people should move in together
 because they want to save money?

26:09.640 --> 26:12.199
 No, we should do this because
 we want to be a proper family.

26:12.200 --> 26:15.200
 Well, it sounds to me like you're asking
 for a little bit more than romance.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.799
 I love him.

26:17.800 --> 26:20.800
 I don't want to go through
 my life and not feel that...

26:20.920 --> 26:23.879
 -That intimacy with someone again.
 -Oh!

26:23.880 --> 26:25.559
 What about you, Mother Superior?

26:25.560 --> 26:28.279

 want to feel intimate again?

26:28.280 --> 26:29.999
 Oh, men will be knocking your door down.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
 Yeah, well, the only interest I got
 on day one was from a porter.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.319
 -Oh!
 -Porter?

26:34.320 --> 26:36.799
 What's wrong with that? I don't mind
 you bringing a porter to my wedding.

 -Yeah, I suppose he was.
 -How's Jack, Katie?

26:46.760 --> 26:49.079
 Yes, what's he like now?

26:49.080 --> 26:52.080
 Well, you know, married, a father,
 my boss.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.640
 -Sounds perfect for you.
 -That's enough out of you, Snow White.

26:56.240 --> 26:59.199
 Well, never mind what's he like now.
 What was he like back at med school?

26:59.200 --> 27:02.200
 Oh, he was lovely. They were lovely.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.359
 -Was he your first?
 -No.

27:06.360 --> 27:09.360

 wasn't he, Katie?

 take a look at this.

 And, um, get back to you,
 if that's all right?

 to come round for dinner tonight.

29:39.280 --> 29:41.039
 Yeah, that'll be great. Thanks.

 to mention it to the firm.

 Okay.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.799
 Well, you're settling in very well here,

29:49.800 --> 29:51.959

 to the rest of them.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.679

29:53.680 --> 29:55.879
 and fancied Simon Le Bon
 the first time round?

29:55.880 --> 29:57.959
 Meaning that if they catch us
 swapping Bowie lyrics,

29:57.960 --> 29:59.719
 we'll never hear the end of it.

30:00.880 --> 30:03.479
 -for you, Katie.
 -I know, I know.

30:03.480 --> 30:06.480
 Because the last year or so,
 with the GMC business?

30:06.800 --> 30:09.800
 Well, it can't have been
 very easy for you.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.840
 It's all right, Katie.
 It doesn't make any difference to me.

 Sold out in one afternoon. Your takings.

 I made sure I had a couple myself.
 They were delicious.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.560
 There's something else in there.

 you stand to make a lot of money.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.639
 -Oh.
 -The longer you stay married,

31:16.640 --> 31:19.640
 the more you will make.
 He's even added an infidelity bonus.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.679
 -What?
 -If he's unfaithful,

31:24.680 --> 31:27.399
 and, obviously it depends on
 whether you catch him,

31:27.400 --> 31:30.400
 he'll add 25 grand
 to the total for each indiscretion.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.960
 Now, if I were you and judging from
 what you've told me,

31:34.960 --> 31:36.599
 I would sign that thing.

31:36.600 --> 31:39.600
 No. No, not in a million years.
 Cheeky boy.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.440
 You know, I knew he was up to something.
 I knew it!

31:48.280 --> 31:51.280
 -Have a drink.
 -Thank you.

31:52.240 --> 31:55.240
 And some crisps.

 -Want it in my teeth?
 -Thank you.

32:11.040 --> 32:14.040
 It's like he thinks that
 I can't look after myself.

32:15.880 --> 32:18.679
 Look, forget about it.
 Go to Katie's tonight and just have fun.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.959
 Well, I'm not staying at Katie's
 any more, she's got that dinner.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.639
 You'll be staying
 at Trudi's then, surely?

32:22.640 --> 32:24.959
 Please, I'm not staying in that madhouse
 the night before my wedding.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.719
 But, love, you can't spend
 tonight on your own.

32:27.720 --> 32:30.239
 Are you inviting me to a slumber party?

32:30.240 --> 32:33.240
 Well, yeah, of course.
 I mean, I do have to ask Hari first.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.359
 -If it's a problem...
 -No, no, no. I'd love you to come.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.039
 -There isn't a problem, please come.
 -Are you sure?

32:38.040 --> 32:41.040
 -I would love you to. Mm-hm.
 -Okay, well, that'll be fun.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.800
 -I can see Elsa. Come on, then. Come on.
 -Yeah.

32:50.560 --> 32:53.560
 (LAUGHING) Thank you.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.880
 -To you, your cakes and what's-his-name.

33:03.320 --> 33:06.320

 -Trudi?
 -I want us all to be together,

33:27.480 --> 33:30.480
 -properly.
 -We will be.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.440
 You don't...

33:40.960 --> 33:43.960
 Oh, no, you want us to get married.

33:44.640 --> 33:47.119
 Do I need to remind you
 that we're both married already?

33:47.120 --> 33:50.120
 -No, of course you don't, but...
 -But what?

33:52.320 --> 33:55.320
 Well, I want to be with you.
 Really with you.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.400
 Trudi, I don't want to
 get married again.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.958
 I don't know, Siobhan,
 it's not exactly convenient.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.960
 Hari, please. It's got nothing to do
 with convenience, does it?

34:16.400 --> 34:19.400
 I mean, it doesn't have to be forever,
 but one night?

34:21.920 --> 34:23.199

34:23.199 --> 34:26.199

 And she'd be on her own otherwise.

34:28.280 --> 34:31.280
 Okay. Okay.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.320
 -I'll cook something.
 -Thank you.

34:36.360 --> 34:39.360
 Thank you.

 -Hello.

34:44.639 --> 34:46.279
 -How are you?
 -Good, good.

34:46.280 --> 34:47.399
 Thank you.

34:47.400 --> 34:50.400
 I think I should warn you.
 Jack's friend, Dan, is here.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.839
 -Right.
 -And he's awful, I mean,

34:52.840 --> 34:55.199
 he's a heart surgeon and I adore him,

34:55.199 --> 34:58.200
 but he really is the last
 of the serial monogamists and

34:59.120 --> 35:01.879
 unhappily for you,
 he happens to be single right now.

35:01.880 --> 35:04.880
 -Well, I'm sure I can handle it.
 -Let's get you a drink. Glass of wine?

35:08.520 --> 35:11.520
 Hello, Katie. Can you hear something?

35:11.840 --> 35:12.959
 -No, I can't.
 -No.

 Hello.

35:20.680 --> 35:23.680
 -So, not a hospital porter, then?
 -No, not normally.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
 -Have you two met?
 -I am very sorry about that

35:29.120 --> 35:32.120
 and for gate-crashing your dinner,
 but I wanted to meet you properly, so...

35:34.040 --> 35:35.999
 And preferably somewhere
 you won't be able to just crush me

35:36.000 --> 35:38.119
 and then casually wander off.

35:38.120 --> 35:41.120
 Katie, if you want to crush him and
 wander off, you absolutely be my guest.

35:47.480 --> 35:50.199
 So we'll have champagne
 and Hari's going to cook.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.319
 It'll be great.

35:51.320 --> 35:54.199
 Are you turning this into
 your own little boudoir or something?

35:54.200 --> 35:57.200
 No. No, it's just, um...

35:58.720 --> 36:01.720
 Hari's up a lot with the baby
 and I'm the one who is working so...

36:02.000 --> 36:04.919
 Sometimes I sleep in here.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.920
 Sounds like a sensible arrangement.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.400
 He used to make pies.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.199
 I think his grandma taught him
 how to make pastry once

36:14.200 --> 36:15.799
 and that was all he could make.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.800
 So he used to just bung anything
 and everything into huge pastry case

36:19.680 --> 36:22.680
 -and cremate it.
 -What rubbish. You loved it.

36:23.360 --> 36:26.239
 -And you do, too.
 -I do, darling, I do.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.319
 But remember, it's always me
 who has to wash up.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.239
 -Oh, darling.
 -So, you two,

36:31.240 --> 36:33.999
 how long has Dan
 been coming over for supper?

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
 -Oh, probably about...
 -Six or seven years?

36:37.560 --> 36:40.560
 -Yeah, since about 2000.
 -Yeah. Yes, he made a pass at Megan.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.560
 -No.
 -Oh, God. She wasn't wearing her ring.

36:47.840 --> 36:50.840
 Oh, God, honestly, Katie, she wasn't.
 I was completely innocent.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.399
 Anyway, who could blame me,
 she's gorgeous.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.519
 Yeah, all right.

36:54.520 --> 36:57.520
 You see how we've put up with him
 for so long?

36:58.440 --> 37:01.440
 -So lovely to have you here, Katie.
 -Thank you.

37:01.560 --> 37:04.560
 How did it happen?
 You leave your surgery,

37:05.040 --> 37:08.040
 do a year with VSO and then
 go back to the beginning again.

37:11.400 --> 37:14.119
 Don't answer that.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.120
 -MEGAN: Dan, be quiet.
 -No, really, no. I don't want to know.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.439
 Well, I'm a guest here, too.

37:20.440 --> 37:23.039
 And Katie's sense of mystery
 is crucial to my fascination in her.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.040
 Shut up!

37:37.800 --> 37:40.800
 -Sorry.
 -Love, it's just me.

 -I don't think so.

 Oh! It's just transport.

38:13.200 --> 38:16.200
 -Okay, it's not just transport.
 -I've ordered a cab, so...

 I really appreciate

38:21.480 --> 38:23.879
 what you did in there earlier.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.880
 But the last couple of years
 have been, uh, not good.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.119
 I'm just trying to keep my life
 simple now,

38:31.120 --> 38:34.120
 -so I hope you can understand that.
 -I can.
